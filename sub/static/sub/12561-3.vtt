WEBVTT

00:01.008 --> 00:02.541
<i>Previously on Royal Pains...</i>

00:02.542 --> 00:03.808
You let a billionaire
hospital trustee die

00:03.809 --> 00:05.434
to save some kid
off the street.

00:05.435 --> 00:07.349
- I made a judgment call.
- You made a mistake.

00:07.350 --> 00:08.742
This trip is gonna
get you back on your feet.

00:08.743 --> 00:10.772
- What trip?
- To the Hamptons!

00:10.773 --> 00:12.709
Stay in my guest cottage
for the summer.

00:12.710 --> 00:14.877
This thing you have,
it's genetic.

00:14.878 --> 00:16.575
Quite fatal.

00:16.576 --> 00:17.574
I'd like to start making
some calls.

00:17.575 --> 00:19.107
Dr. Marisa Casseras.

00:19.108 --> 00:21.272
You don't want your dad to see
how far you've come?

00:21.273 --> 00:23.571
When my mom got sick,
he just walked out on us.

00:23.572 --> 00:25.938
What you did was gutless
and pitiful.

00:25.939 --> 00:28.437
In the last three days
I found the most wonderful man.

00:28.438 --> 00:30.904
Hi, boys.

00:38.375 --> 00:41.042
You are gonna love the new script.

00:41.043 --> 00:43.544
We've really dimensionalized
your character.

00:43.545 --> 00:45.078
Fleshed out his backstory,
given him a girlfriend.

00:45.079 --> 00:46.745
I have a girlfriend?

00:46.746 --> 00:49.247
Beauty and the Beast.
It's timeless.

00:49.248 --> 00:50.747
I'm guessing I'm not
the Beauty.

00:50.748 --> 00:52.481
[chuckles]
Plus, the girlfriend will

00:52.482 --> 00:54.916
really shore up
our female demographics.

00:54.917 --> 00:56.816
- But I live in a landfill.
- Used to.

00:56.817 --> 00:58.117
Now you live in Miami.

00:58.118 --> 00:59.750
This isn't the minor leagues
anymore.

01:03.719 --> 01:07.353
It sounds great, but I'd like
to run it by Faith.

01:07.354 --> 01:09.388
Hi. I am so sorry I'm late.

01:09.389 --> 01:11.290
I forgot the name of the restaurant.

01:11.291 --> 01:12.591
Oh, is that the shooting script?

01:12.592 --> 01:13.925
Hot off the presses.

01:13.926 --> 01:16.425
- I have a girlfriend.
- In a landfill?

01:16.426 --> 01:18.460
Miami.

01:18.461 --> 01:19.660
You are going to love this.

01:19.661 --> 01:22.929
We'll see when I read the script.

01:22.930 --> 01:24.363
[chuckles]

01:24.364 --> 01:25.763
So how long will you be
in the Hamptons?

01:25.764 --> 01:27.097
A week.

01:27.098 --> 01:28.898
Oh, then you must come
to a party

01:28.899 --> 01:31.666
that I'm having on Saturday.

01:31.667 --> 01:33.100
We'd love to.

01:33.101 --> 01:34.534
Oh, great!
This is so exciting.

01:34.535 --> 01:37.569
It's my son Bowen's birthday...
he'll be 11.

01:37.570 --> 01:39.170
He is your biggest fan.

01:39.171 --> 01:40.971
Terrific.

01:40.972 --> 01:44.073
Uh, okay, well, I'll let you two

01:44.074 --> 01:46.040
take care of the business stuff.

01:46.041 --> 01:48.141
Oh, Donald, a question.

01:48.142 --> 01:49.809
Do you travel with your costume?

01:49.810 --> 01:54.112
Because I'd love it
if you could come in character.

01:54.113 --> 01:55.446
Sure. Love to.

01:55.447 --> 01:57.947
Oh, fantastic.

01:57.948 --> 02:00.749
Thank you, sweetheart.

while you were pulling out

02:30.637 --> 02:32.037
of the restaurant parking lot.

02:32.038 --> 02:33.272
You have any drinks
while you were in there?

02:33.273 --> 02:35.440
Just a diet cola.

02:38.577 --> 02:40.277
You want to step out
of the vehicle for a second?

02:40.278 --> 02:43.514
[warning bell dinging]

02:50.653 --> 02:54.589
And, um...
Step over to the curb.

03:01.061 --> 03:03.529
All right, I'm gonna give you
a field sobriety test.

03:03.530 --> 03:05.130
What I'd like you to do is take

03:05.131 --> 03:07.165
nine heel-to-toe steps
towards me.

03:10.969 --> 03:13.003
All right, sir,
I want you to stop.

03:13.004 --> 03:14.237
My legs.

03:14.238 --> 03:17.073
Sir, I'm not gonna
ask you again!

[electricity crackles]

03:24.178 --> 03:27.980
I hate having to hitch a ride.

Why are you having lunch
with Newberg anyway?

03:29.816 --> 03:31.383
Look, if Eddie's gonna
be around

03:31.384 --> 03:32.751
and get tangled in our lives,

03:32.752 --> 03:35.753
I can't control it,
but I can warn her.

03:35.754 --> 03:37.955
So you're choosing our client
over our dad?

03:37.956 --> 03:39.456
Exactly.

03:39.457 --> 03:41.724
I just don't understand why
you have to say anything at all.

03:41.725 --> 03:44.825
What the hell is that?

03:46.658 --> 03:48.158
Yeah, I need backup.

03:48.159 --> 03:50.260
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What do you think you're doing?

03:50.261 --> 03:51.794
- He's suffocating.
- He's a doctor.

03:51.795 --> 03:53.629
Look, you have to
uncuff him now.

03:53.630 --> 03:55.331
No, I'm not letting
Mongo loose.

03:55.332 --> 03:56.965
Look, he's got
positional asphyxia.

03:56.966 --> 03:58.266
The only thing he's trying
to get at is some oxygen.

03:58.267 --> 04:01.269
Please.

04:03.306 --> 04:05.841
It's gonna be all right.
I got you.

04:05.842 --> 04:07.910
Evan, help me roll him over now.

04:07.911 --> 04:09.645
Let's go.

Humongous... forever.

of your movies.

with Fangoria last month... Epic!

04:43.139 --> 04:44.205

Yeah, I would love a picture.

It grossed $80 million.
80 million!

05:33.491 --> 05:34.691
You must have made a killing
off that, right?

05:34.692 --> 05:36.092
- Evan, would you please...
- What?

I mean,
I wasn't complaining.

05:44.300 --> 05:45.800
It was better than being
a bodyguard.

05:45.801 --> 05:46.835
Arnold Schwarzenegger's bodyguard.

05:46.836 --> 05:48.236
Right? Arnold Schwarzenegger?

05:48.237 --> 05:49.670
- Right.
- That's so cool.

look like Garbage Collector I.

What does that even mean?

05:58.578 --> 05:59.812
How much do I owe you, doc?

[camera clicks]

06:01.814 --> 06:03.181
I think we can call it even.

[chuckles]

06:12.324 --> 06:13.824
Mm...

06:13.825 --> 06:16.893
I shouldn't have eaten
that cake, Hank.

06:16.894 --> 06:18.995
I should have just applied it
directly to my thighs.

06:18.996 --> 06:19.996
[chuckles]

06:19.997 --> 06:23.799
Okay...

06:23.800 --> 06:25.200
So this is, uh...

06:25.201 --> 06:26.435
This is a little awkward
for me.

06:26.436 --> 06:29.271
Hank, I'm not trying
to replace your mother.

06:29.272 --> 06:31.372
What? No, that's...

06:31.373 --> 06:33.207
Your father is
a wonderful man,

06:33.208 --> 06:35.142
but we're just dating.

06:35.143 --> 06:37.811
Though he is hard to resist.

06:37.812 --> 06:39.412
Did you know he's
bringing sexy back?

06:39.413 --> 06:42.347
I wasn't aware it had left.

06:42.348 --> 06:43.682
- But you should know...
- He's not after my money,

06:43.683 --> 06:45.583
if that's what you're
worried about.

06:45.584 --> 06:46.751
Well, I...

06:46.752 --> 06:48.385
He told me all about
his financial problems.

06:48.386 --> 06:50.720
How he borrowed money
from you,

06:50.721 --> 06:52.588
and he was embarrassed
when he paid you back late.

06:52.589 --> 06:55.324
- He told you all that?
- We have no secrets, Hank.

06:55.325 --> 06:58.127
Well, maybe I kept one or two.

06:58.128 --> 07:00.862
Yeah, he may have also.

07:00.863 --> 07:04.432
You know what?
My last name is reserved.

07:04.433 --> 07:06.167
Would you excuse me
a second?

07:06.168 --> 07:08.168
I don't know how
I can make it clearer.

07:08.169 --> 07:11.004
That table is reserved
for someone else.

07:11.005 --> 07:12.706
Yes. And let me make this
very clear.

07:12.707 --> 07:14.574

- I heard you were
having lunch over here,

And I thought maybe I would
join you for coffee.

07:23.082 --> 07:25.483

an extra chair.

What are you going to do
with that?

07:37.827 --> 07:40.561
I want to send this
to a lab in the city

07:40.562 --> 07:42.729
To look for newly identified
gene mutations

07:42.730 --> 07:44.531
that could be pertinent
to your situation.

07:44.532 --> 07:46.532
And if they find them?

07:46.533 --> 07:48.267
Well, then, we'll know
which direction to head in.

07:48.268 --> 07:50.536
There are a number of places
doing good work in this area.

research contact in Cuba,

08:01.279 --> 08:03.581
Dr. Casseras, that seems
particularly promising.

08:03.582 --> 08:05.249
But I've had a difficult time
reaching her.

08:05.250 --> 08:07.318
Yes.

08:07.319 --> 08:09.821
Okay, well, I'll let you know
as soon as I hear back.

Okay, try not to gush.

08:58.067 --> 08:59.668
Uh, I don't think I will.

08:59.669 --> 09:03.339

I believe you've met Donald?

09:22.187 --> 09:23.321
Yes, we have met.

09:23.322 --> 09:24.622
Hello, sir. How are you?

09:24.623 --> 09:26.657
- How you doing, man?
- Welcome.

09:28.359 --> 09:31.427
Hey, Donald, good to see you again.

09:31.428 --> 09:33.230
Hey, doc.

09:33.231 --> 09:36.800
This is Divya Katdare,
my physician assistant.

09:36.801 --> 09:38.601
- Ma'am.
- So how can I help you?

09:38.602 --> 09:40.202
Well, his knees and lower legs
have been feeling weak,

09:40.203 --> 09:42.638
He gets a tingly feeling
in his feet,

09:42.639 --> 09:44.339
and his balance is
occasionally off.

09:44.340 --> 09:45.807
I'll shut up now.

09:45.808 --> 09:48.042
How long has this been going on?

09:48.043 --> 09:49.677
Two to three months,
give or take.

09:49.678 --> 09:50.711
I mean, it comes and goes.

09:50.712 --> 09:51.812
Yeah. Thank God he has

09:51.813 --> 09:53.547
an insurance physical
in two weeks,

09:53.548 --> 09:56.549
otherwise he'd never agree
to see a doctor.

09:56.550 --> 09:58.818
That's absolutely the last thing
I'll say.

09:58.819 --> 10:00.286
Faith, why don't you and I
step outside for a sec?

10:00.287 --> 10:01.921
- Sure.
- Just for a sec.

10:01.922 --> 10:03.356
I think that's a good idea.

10:03.357 --> 10:05.124
Why don't you come into my office.

10:09.495 --> 10:10.961
Whoa.

10:10.962 --> 10:12.996
He's gonna be fine.

10:12.997 --> 10:14.564
Okay?
I promise you.

10:14.565 --> 10:16.099
He's in really good hands
with my brother.

10:16.100 --> 10:19.569
Thanks. God. There's just
so much going on right now.

10:19.570 --> 10:22.038
He's under such stress.
We both are.

10:22.039 --> 10:24.107
- Well, the Hamptons
is a pretty good place

10:24.108 --> 10:25.208
to reduce stress.

10:25.209 --> 10:26.710
Is it?
I've never been here.

10:26.711 --> 10:28.344
Really?

10:28.345 --> 10:32.181
Maybe you'd be willing
to show me the sights.

10:32.182 --> 10:34.417
Willing and able.

10:34.418 --> 10:37.520
- Great.
- I mean, if my brother's okay,

10:37.521 --> 10:38.821
- and our schedule is clear.
- What's that?

10:38.822 --> 10:41.724
Donald is my big brother.

10:41.725 --> 10:44.026
You knew that, right?

10:44.027 --> 10:46.028
I hope you're messing with me.

10:46.029 --> 10:49.265
Because,
short of a white snake reunion,

10:49.266 --> 10:51.066
that might be
the most frightening news

10:51.067 --> 10:52.601
I've ever heard.

10:52.602 --> 10:54.136
- Oh. Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

10:54.137 --> 10:55.270
They just ran some tests.

10:55.271 --> 10:56.305
Yeah, I'll let you know

10:56.306 --> 10:57.406
as soon as we have the results.

10:57.407 --> 10:58.674
In the meantime, no mayhem,

10:58.675 --> 11:01.610
no killing bad guys
or whatever.

11:01.611 --> 11:03.845
- No, we have no mayhem.
We have nothing on our schedule.

11:03.846 --> 11:06.348
In fact, Evan was going
to show me the Hampton sites.

11:06.349 --> 11:09.217
- Yeah.
- She asked me.

11:09.218 --> 11:13.720
Just because you guys...
Oh.

11:13.721 --> 11:16.155
I think you should take her
to a nice restaurant.

11:17.391 --> 11:20.559
- Yeah.
- Where a gentleman

11:20.560 --> 11:22.861
would take a lady.
[cracking]

11:22.862 --> 11:26.030
We have a lot in common,
you know.

11:26.031 --> 11:27.431
We both work for our brothers.

11:27.432 --> 11:29.066
We both have professional degrees

11:29.067 --> 11:30.300
in fields we're not using.

11:30.301 --> 11:32.468
And we both think you're cute.

11:32.469 --> 11:34.737
True, true, and true.

11:34.738 --> 11:37.373
Oh, well, last year,
you know,

11:37.374 --> 11:39.174
between being on location

11:39.175 --> 11:40.309
and personal appearances

11:40.310 --> 11:43.578
and Donald can't say no
to anyone,

11:43.579 --> 11:45.146
we were on the road
for 39 weeks.

11:45.147 --> 11:47.115
- Whoa.
- I know.

11:47.116 --> 11:48.716
You must get exhausted
with all the flying.

11:48.717 --> 11:50.051
But you're getting points,
though, so that's good.

11:50.052 --> 11:52.286
Oh, no, we drive everywhere.

11:52.287 --> 11:55.723
What? No wonder you're
on the road for 39 weeks.

11:55.724 --> 11:58.158
Well, flying is not too comfy
for Donald.

11:58.159 --> 12:00.861
When he's in row 21,
his feet are in row 19.

12:00.862 --> 12:03.163
You know what, I'm gonna
make you a "HankMed travel kit".

12:03.164 --> 12:05.032
It's something I throw together

12:05.033 --> 12:06.834
for clients who are always on the go.

12:06.835 --> 12:08.969
That is so sweet.

12:08.970 --> 12:11.038
It's just a bag full of trinkets.

12:11.039 --> 12:12.506
Are you okay?

12:12.507 --> 12:15.575
Oh, yeah.
Sorry, I'm fine.

12:15.576 --> 12:18.111
I'm just so used
to being the caretaker

12:18.112 --> 12:22.015
That, when someone
does something for me...

12:22.016 --> 12:23.750
Well, I'll tell you what,
Faith,

12:23.751 --> 12:25.152
if it makes you feel any better,

12:25.153 --> 12:26.620
you can pay for dinner.

12:26.621 --> 12:28.021
You can pay for the whole thing.

12:28.022 --> 12:30.223
You know, traveling so much,

12:30.224 --> 12:32.559
you rarely meet good guys,
and when you do,

12:32.560 --> 12:35.161
it's... you're off
to the next town.

12:35.162 --> 12:36.296
Hmm.

12:36.297 --> 12:39.065
Oh, they're just vitamins.

12:39.066 --> 12:40.433
Being on the road
as much as we are,

12:40.434 --> 12:41.701
You do what you can
to stay healthy.

12:41.702 --> 12:43.836
Yeah. Of course.

12:43.837 --> 12:47.173
Big ones.

12:47.174 --> 12:52.311
So I'm really out of practice
with this whole dating thing,

12:52.312 --> 12:55.180
but you want to get
out of here?

12:55.181 --> 12:57.816
Now?

12:57.817 --> 12:59.651
- We just got our dinner.
- Oh!

12:59.652 --> 13:00.986
You haven't even touched yours yet.

13:00.987 --> 13:03.755
Yeah, well, I recently lost some weight,

13:03.756 --> 13:05.357
And I feel so much better,

13:05.358 --> 13:06.892
And I just plan on keeping it off.

13:06.893 --> 13:09.094
- Okay.
- Okay.

13:09.095 --> 13:11.096
This is nice, isn't it?

13:11.097 --> 13:13.565
Yeah, it is.

13:13.566 --> 13:17.335
[cell phone beeps]
Oh.

13:17.336 --> 13:18.870
I'm sorry.
I have to get this.

13:18.871 --> 13:21.873
Yeah, yes. Of course.

13:28.213 --> 13:31.015
Henry, mayday, mayday.

13:31.016 --> 13:32.817
You need to call me
in five minutes

13:32.818 --> 13:34.118
And pretend that it's an emergency.

13:34.119 --> 13:35.919
Yes, I'm completely serious.

13:35.920 --> 13:38.655
Call me in five...
Henry?

13:38.656 --> 13:40.423
[sighs]
I'm so sorry.

13:40.424 --> 13:41.924
No, it's okay.

13:41.925 --> 13:45.594
- Where were we?
- Where were we?

13:45.595 --> 13:47.629
Things have really changed for
Donald and me this last year.

13:47.630 --> 13:49.564
Do you know how many weeks
I was on the road for?

13:49.565 --> 13:51.232
39?

13:51.233 --> 13:54.268
- Yes, exactly.
- It was lonely too.

13:54.269 --> 13:56.537
You rarely meet any good guys,
and when you do...

13:56.538 --> 13:57.571
[laughs]

13:57.572 --> 13:59.005
What?

13:59.006 --> 14:01.074
We just had this conversation, right?

14:01.075 --> 14:04.509
We just had this exact conversation.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.312
You don't remember that?

14:08.348 --> 14:11.350
[laughs]

14:18.141 --> 14:19.808
Sorry about the shoe thing.

14:19.809 --> 14:21.743
Arnold's letting me use
his house for the week,

14:21.744 --> 14:24.012
and he's really finicky
about that sort of thing.

14:24.013 --> 14:25.213
Hey, don't want to make Arnold mad.

14:25.214 --> 14:26.814
Right.

14:26.815 --> 14:28.582
So all your tests
came back negative.

14:28.583 --> 14:30.350
Except you're slightly anemic.

14:30.351 --> 14:31.818
Is that causing
the weakness in my legs?

14:31.819 --> 14:33.053
Oh, not by itself.

14:33.054 --> 14:35.388
You don't have
an iron deficiency anemia,

14:35.389 --> 14:37.423
and your sodium
and potassium levels are fine.

14:37.424 --> 14:38.857
Donald!

14:38.858 --> 14:40.259
What?

14:46.432 --> 14:48.699
- Hi.
- Hey. What's up?

14:48.700 --> 14:50.734
I was in the area,
thought I'd stop by

14:50.735 --> 14:51.869
and say hi to my friend Jill.

14:51.870 --> 14:53.103
And?

14:53.104 --> 14:55.938
Does there have
to be an and?

14:55.939 --> 14:58.742
And do you know
where there's an MRI machine

14:58.743 --> 15:00.110
big enough for a seven-foot-tall,

15:00.111 --> 15:02.211
500-pound patient?

15:02.212 --> 15:04.747
Wait. The Garbage Collector's
your patient?

15:04.748 --> 15:05.815
Yeah. How...

15:05.816 --> 15:07.416
Hank, I love
the Garbage Collector.

15:07.417 --> 15:09.351
I have the entire DVD box set.

15:09.352 --> 15:11.519
So do you know where
there's a large MRI machine

15:11.520 --> 15:13.587
I can use?

15:13.588 --> 15:17.423
Uh, well, it's a bit
unorthodox, but, yeah.

15:17.424 --> 15:19.358
Do you want to tell me?

15:19.359 --> 15:23.097
I don't. But I'll show you.

15:23.098 --> 15:25.333
I saw the first trash collector
at fear fest.

15:25.334 --> 15:27.802
I had nightmares for six months.

15:27.803 --> 15:30.339
- Thank you.
- And in one, I dreamt

15:30.340 --> 15:31.507
that I went to the orthodontist,

15:31.508 --> 15:32.575
and he gave me trash teeth.

15:32.576 --> 15:34.177
How do you even talk
with those?

15:34.178 --> 15:35.678
I have ten different sets
of teeth.

15:35.679 --> 15:38.881
Some for long shots,
some for closeups,

15:38.882 --> 15:40.783
and then some for talking.

15:40.784 --> 15:43.019
So it's a horse MRI.

15:43.020 --> 15:45.990
Sorry about this.

15:45.991 --> 15:47.491
Don't be, Jill.

15:47.492 --> 15:48.959
I've had to live with being big

15:48.960 --> 15:50.694
my entire life.

15:50.695 --> 15:52.529
As a kid,
I was growing so fast,

15:52.530 --> 15:56.299
for entertainment,
my parents used to stand me

15:56.300 --> 15:57.834
in the middle of the room
and just watch me grow.

15:57.835 --> 15:59.536
[laughs]

15:59.537 --> 16:02.838
- Okay.
- I guess we should go in.

16:02.839 --> 16:04.573
Come on, let's go.

16:07.911 --> 16:10.579
[cell phone rings]

16:10.580 --> 16:12.548
Okay, so it's not baseball.

16:12.549 --> 16:14.650
Remember?
Just tap it.

16:14.651 --> 16:17.252
Just get it over the net.

16:17.253 --> 16:21.824
[cell phone rings]

16:21.825 --> 16:23.093
Are you gonna finally answer that?

16:23.094 --> 16:25.728
No. I already know who it is.

16:25.729 --> 16:27.362
[voice mail chime]

16:27.363 --> 16:28.730
It's this girl.
She's really cute, actually.

16:28.731 --> 16:30.798
She likes me.
But she has a brother

16:30.799 --> 16:32.466
who's the size of Trump tower,

16:32.467 --> 16:34.503
And I suspect he wants to kill me.

16:34.504 --> 16:36.137
Well, you know,
that's the Lawson curse.

16:36.138 --> 16:37.838
- Oh, yeah?
- When you're wildly desirable

16:37.839 --> 16:40.574
to women, that's the cross
you gotta bear.

16:40.575 --> 16:42.308
- Lawson curse.
- All right.

16:42.309 --> 16:45.945
Coming at you.
[exhales]

16:48.949 --> 16:51.417
So it's good.
It's a homerun.

16:51.418 --> 16:54.653
- Yeah.
- Hey, pal, can you help me out?

16:57.056 --> 17:01.058
The guy at the gate
said make a left at the topiary.

17:01.059 --> 17:02.493
What the hell is a topiary?

17:02.494 --> 17:04.862
A topiary, that's a shrub or a tree

17:04.863 --> 17:06.864
trimmed into decorative shapes.

17:06.865 --> 17:09.199
Look, I just gotta drop off
some medical supplies

17:09.200 --> 17:10.467
and get on with my route.

17:10.468 --> 17:11.835
Oh, yeah, that's my son,
the doctor.

17:11.836 --> 17:14.104
I'll sign that.

17:14.105 --> 17:17.607
Thank you.

17:17.608 --> 17:21.011
- What's the name?
- Eddie.

17:24.115 --> 17:25.715
Hi, Evan.

17:25.717 --> 17:27.451
Oh!
Oh, no, Evan.

17:27.452 --> 17:30.454
Hey, Faith.
So you're... you're alone.

17:30.455 --> 17:31.521
Um, how...
what are you doing here?

17:31.522 --> 17:32.989
Oh, Donald has an appointment.

17:32.990 --> 17:34.791
- Oh.
- He has another appointment?

17:34.792 --> 17:36.159
- Another?
- Yeah, he was here yesterday.

17:36.160 --> 17:37.628
Friday, right?

17:37.629 --> 17:40.163
[exclaims]

17:40.164 --> 17:43.633
Oh, no, it's Saturday.
The party.

17:43.634 --> 17:45.568
Okay, I have to get
to further lane.

17:45.569 --> 17:47.971
- Do you know where that is?
- Uh.

17:51.710 --> 17:53.377
[chatter]

17:53.378 --> 17:56.880
[laughs]

17:56.881 --> 17:58.248
It's mature.

17:58.249 --> 18:00.251
Maybe let some of the other kids go.

18:00.252 --> 18:02.486
It was my turn.
What's with the 910 text?

18:02.487 --> 18:03.854
What does that even mean?

18:03.855 --> 18:05.656
It's not quite a 911 emergency,

18:05.657 --> 18:07.024
but it's close.

18:07.025 --> 18:08.326
- So that's why you got me here?
- Yeah.

18:08.327 --> 18:11.662
Hank, please, you need
to run interference with Faith.

18:11.663 --> 18:14.031
Okay? She keeps conveniently
forgetting things

18:14.032 --> 18:16.199
to get what she wants,
which happens to be me.

18:16.200 --> 18:18.201
- Hey!
- Oh, hi.

18:18.202 --> 18:19.702
- Hey, Faith.
- Yeah, she's crazier

18:19.703 --> 18:21.404
than Glenn close on Easter.

18:21.405 --> 18:23.072
Okay, I'm s... Talk to her.

18:23.073 --> 18:25.208
- See for yourself.
- Okay, are you...

18:25.209 --> 18:27.143
Are you familiar
with the Hubble telescope?

18:27.144 --> 18:28.411
- Yeah.
- It's the most powerful

18:28.412 --> 18:30.179
telescope in the world, right?

18:30.180 --> 18:32.814
I mean, it can actually see
into distant galaxies.

18:32.815 --> 18:34.783
- Yeah.
- If I were using

18:34.784 --> 18:36.117
that telescope right now,

18:36.118 --> 18:38.019
I still wouldn't be able
to discover

18:38.020 --> 18:39.754
how little I care
about your problem.

18:39.755 --> 18:43.124
- Okay.
- I'm begging you here.

18:43.125 --> 18:45.960
Please. Please.
Her brother's here.

18:45.961 --> 18:47.996
- Donald's here?
- Yeah, he's in the cabana.

18:47.997 --> 18:49.363
He's doing something
for the kid's birthday.

18:49.364 --> 18:51.465
- Oh.
- I just... look.

18:51.466 --> 18:52.500
I'll prove it to you.

18:52.501 --> 18:53.934
Okay, I will prove it to you.

18:53.935 --> 18:55.536
Give me five minutes
to make the clock go cuckoo,

18:55.537 --> 18:56.603
we're out of here.

18:56.604 --> 18:57.771
Five minutes.

18:57.772 --> 18:59.339
Five minutes, we're out of here.

18:59.340 --> 19:00.440
Don't forget to get
a gift bag on your way out.

19:00.441 --> 19:03.143
Hey, Hank, did you know

19:03.144 --> 19:04.311
That your brother
is the sweetest person

19:04.312 --> 19:05.613
in the world?

19:05.614 --> 19:06.814
- Well...
- I get so lost around here,

19:06.815 --> 19:08.115
and he offered to drive me.

19:08.116 --> 19:09.917
He is my knight in shining armor.

19:09.918 --> 19:12.220
- That's nice.
- Nice to see you, Faith.

19:12.221 --> 19:15.790
You guys look cute together.

19:15.791 --> 19:17.558
Did you tell him to say that?
[laughs]

19:17.559 --> 19:21.195
Uh, Donald?

19:21.196 --> 19:22.263
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:22.264 --> 19:23.898
I've never had a groupie before.

19:23.899 --> 19:26.033
Uh, yeah, no, I'm actually here

19:26.034 --> 19:27.769
because my brother sent me
a 910 text.

19:27.770 --> 19:29.137
Don't ask.

19:29.138 --> 19:30.338
How's the hand?

19:30.339 --> 19:31.639
Not bad.

19:31.640 --> 19:32.640
All things considered.

19:32.641 --> 19:34.509
- Yeah.
- Looking good.

19:34.510 --> 19:38.746
Is all this supposed
to scare the kids?

19:38.747 --> 19:40.048
- Yeah.
- Why?

19:40.049 --> 19:41.249
I don't know.

19:41.250 --> 19:42.850
The kids out here, they're, you know,

19:42.851 --> 19:44.618
they've kind of seen it all,
so...

19:44.619 --> 19:47.621
[sighs]
that doesn't bode well for me.

19:47.622 --> 19:50.758
No.

19:50.759 --> 19:51.892
Unless...

19:51.893 --> 19:54.128
Unless?

19:54.129 --> 19:55.896
Okay, everybody.

19:55.897 --> 19:58.065
Pay attention.
Hands up.

19:58.066 --> 20:00.567
- Put your hands up.
- Okay.

20:00.568 --> 20:02.703
Okay, kids, gather round
all over here.

20:02.704 --> 20:04.471
Gather round.
Hands up.

20:04.472 --> 20:05.873
Okay, good job.
Good job.

20:05.874 --> 20:09.677
Now is everybody
ready for the big show?

20:09.678 --> 20:10.977
Yes!!!

20:10.978 --> 20:12.645
Are you excited?

20:12.646 --> 20:14.413
Yes!!!

20:14.414 --> 20:17.482
Ready!

20:17.483 --> 20:21.085
[roars]

20:23.121 --> 20:24.388
[roars]

20:27.424 --> 20:30.225
[roars]

20:30.226 --> 20:32.760
Yeah, this is not going
so well for him.

20:32.761 --> 20:34.862
No.

20:37.666 --> 20:41.168
You threw that recyclable

20:41.169 --> 20:43.203
in the wrong container.

20:43.204 --> 20:46.538
Uh, yeah, I guess I did.

20:46.539 --> 20:51.009
It's people like you

20:51.010 --> 20:56.413
that are ruining this planet.

20:56.414 --> 20:59.749
Oh, yeah?

20:59.750 --> 21:02.251
Well, what are you gonna do
about it?

21:02.252 --> 21:05.421
[laughs]

21:05.422 --> 21:07.589
What am I gonna do about it?

21:07.590 --> 21:10.225
Trash him! Trash him!

21:10.226 --> 21:11.760
Trash him!
Trash him!

21:11.761 --> 21:13.862
Trash him! Trash him!

21:13.863 --> 21:16.198
Trash him!
Trash him!

21:16.199 --> 21:19.034
- Oh... okay.
- Trash him! Trash him!

21:19.035 --> 21:21.803
Trash him!
Trash him!

21:21.804 --> 21:23.138
- Trash him!
- Hello.

21:23.139 --> 21:24.239
You're not gonna even try
to help?

21:24.240 --> 21:25.240
Hey, are you familiar

21:25.241 --> 21:26.608
with the Hubble telescope?

21:26.609 --> 21:30.811
It's time to take out the trash!

21:30.812 --> 21:33.147
[laughs]

21:33.148 --> 21:36.083
Oh. Oh.

21:36.084 --> 21:37.785
Uh...

21:37.786 --> 21:40.087
Donald?

21:40.088 --> 21:41.955
[groaning]
oh!

21:43.324 --> 21:46.260
Weren't you supposed
to gently place me

21:46.261 --> 21:47.561
in the trash can?

21:47.562 --> 21:49.397
Hank, I can't feel my legs.

21:55.576 --> 21:57.476
[groans]

21:57.477 --> 22:01.782
I think I'm suffering from
post-traumatic Donald disorder.

22:01.783 --> 22:04.686
Okay, what are you doing?

22:04.687 --> 22:07.856
I'm putting together
a "HankMed travel kit" for Faith.

22:07.857 --> 22:09.357
She gets a bobblehead?

22:09.358 --> 22:11.890
You either really like her
or really don't.

22:11.891 --> 22:13.025
[laughs]

22:13.026 --> 22:15.393
I'm trapped.

22:15.394 --> 22:17.760
I can't do anything with Faith
because of Donald.

22:17.761 --> 22:19.761
And I can't not do anything
with her

22:19.762 --> 22:21.729
because, well, because of her.

22:21.730 --> 22:24.932
It's just-it's your classic
existential dilemma.

22:24.933 --> 22:27.468
Yeah, I don't think
you know what "existential" means.

22:27.469 --> 22:29.736
- No, I know what it means.
- I don't think you do.

22:29.737 --> 22:31.338
I've been thinking
about pulling a will together.

22:31.339 --> 22:33.073
Um, I leave everything to you,

22:33.074 --> 22:35.075
but since I don't
actually own anything,

22:35.076 --> 22:36.443
you just get the will.

22:36.444 --> 22:38.411
So does that interest you
at all?

22:38.412 --> 22:40.646
No, it doesn't.

22:40.647 --> 22:41.880
Where'd these come from?

22:41.881 --> 22:43.548
Well, you see, when a mama box

22:43.549 --> 22:45.050
- and a papa box...
- Really?

22:45.051 --> 22:46.518
Delivery guy brought it.

22:46.519 --> 22:47.851
I didn't order
broad-spectrum antibiotics,

22:47.852 --> 22:49.320
and if I did,
I wouldn't use this many

22:49.321 --> 22:50.954
in a year.

22:50.955 --> 22:52.055
They're from Germany,

22:52.056 --> 22:54.091
addressed to Boris.

22:55.126 --> 22:56.460
[shouts]

22:59.162 --> 23:03.194
[shouts]

23:05.063 --> 23:06.130
[shouts]

23:06.131 --> 23:09.465
[shouts in German]

23:09.466 --> 23:10.866
Sorry to interrupt.

23:10.867 --> 23:13.202
[speaking German]

23:13.203 --> 23:14.536
Hank, what can we do for you?

23:14.537 --> 23:17.639
Well, I was a little surprised
to find

23:17.640 --> 23:21.443
Costcoized box of fixime,
doxycycline,

23:21.444 --> 23:23.179
and azitomycin in my living room.

23:23.180 --> 23:24.980
Oh, yeah, I imagine you would be

23:24.981 --> 23:26.916
since they weren't meant
for you.

23:26.917 --> 23:29.984
[shouts]

23:29.985 --> 23:32.785
Someone give you a heads up
the apocalypse?

23:32.786 --> 23:34.252
Can you tell me

23:34.253 --> 23:37.254
why you had those medications
sent to your home?

23:37.255 --> 23:39.289
They're not for my personal us Hank.

23:39.290 --> 23:40.556
So they shouldn't concern you.

23:40.557 --> 23:42.658
What should concern you
is that an Edward R. Lawson,

23:42.659 --> 23:44.327
your father,

23:44.328 --> 23:47.030
seems to be making himself
at home in my home.

23:47.031 --> 23:49.699
And apparently
he particularly enjoys

23:49.700 --> 23:51.934
the shadow pond tennis courts.

23:51.935 --> 23:54.569
Since that's where he signed
for the medications himself.

23:54.570 --> 23:57.672
- He signed for them?
- Yeah, as simply "Eddie".

23:57.673 --> 24:00.441
It would seem the Lawson is
now implied around her yeah?

24:00.442 --> 24:02.442
It won't happen again.

24:02.443 --> 24:04.977
I consider myself
a hospitable man, Hank,

24:04.978 --> 24:06.577
but my hospitality
has its limits.

24:06.578 --> 24:07.745
I said it won't happen again.

24:07.746 --> 24:09.946
I'm your doctor.

24:09.947 --> 24:11.581
My personal life
doesn't concern you,

24:11.582 --> 24:16.185
especially not my father,
so, please, stay out of it.

24:19.358 --> 24:21.792
Remind me again.

24:21.793 --> 24:24.527
What do we know about Edward Lawson?

24:31.533 --> 24:33.233
- Hey.
- Hi.

24:33.234 --> 24:35.335
These are for you.

24:35.336 --> 24:36.402
They're freshly baked.

24:36.403 --> 24:38.237
- Oh.
- They're Tate's.

24:38.238 --> 24:39.671
Local delicacy.

24:39.672 --> 24:41.073
Yeah, freshly baked there.

24:41.074 --> 24:42.841
Would you mind hiding them?

24:42.842 --> 24:44.009
I don't want Faith to see them.

24:44.010 --> 24:46.078
Why?
Is she a diabetic?

24:46.079 --> 24:49.782
No, she went on a serious diet
a few months ago.

24:49.783 --> 24:51.383
I'm really proud of her,

24:51.384 --> 24:54.286
but I try not to leave around
food that might tempt her.

24:54.287 --> 24:58.255
Okay, well, I would very want
to do anything to tempt her,

24:58.256 --> 24:59.990
so I'm just gonna go and find
a place to stick these.

24:59.991 --> 25:01.458
I could think of a place.

25:01.459 --> 25:04.862
- I'll go check on Faith.
- Okay.

25:04.863 --> 25:08.264
So your spinal tap
came back negative

25:08.265 --> 25:10.867
For encephalitis
and multiple sclerosis,

25:10.868 --> 25:13.536
which is great,
but now I'm stumped.

25:13.537 --> 25:17.140
Isn't there, like, a no-stump
clause in your contract?

25:17.141 --> 25:18.474
Well, that's why there's specialists.

25:18.475 --> 25:20.509
I have some calls out.
I can set it up with Faith.

25:20.510 --> 25:22.345
I just hope the word specialist

25:22.346 --> 25:24.347
doesn't freak out Faith too much.

25:24.348 --> 25:26.816
Well, if it does, there are
specialists for that too.

25:26.817 --> 25:28.418
Evan, something happened today,

25:28.419 --> 25:29.919
and I really need to tell someone.

25:29.920 --> 25:32.355
Oh, um, maybe you should tell
your brother

25:32.356 --> 25:33.890
Oh, I can't.

25:33.891 --> 25:36.025
Okay, well, if you can't tell him,

25:36.026 --> 25:37.793
then, by all means, don't tell me.

25:37.794 --> 25:40.864
I got offered a job.

25:40.865 --> 25:42.632
Do you not hear anything I say?

25:42.633 --> 25:44.834
It's at this great
environmental law firm

25:44.835 --> 25:46.102
back in our hometown.

25:46.103 --> 25:48.938
- Faith, if you're a lawyer,

25:48.939 --> 25:50.072
why aren't you practicing law?

25:50.073 --> 25:52.041
Oh, well, I finished law school,

25:52.042 --> 25:54.043
passed the bar,
but before I could get a job

25:54.044 --> 25:55.744
at a firm, Donald asked me
to work for him,

25:55.745 --> 25:57.379
you know, and I couldn't say no.

25:57.380 --> 25:58.846
Yeah, I have that same problem
with him.

25:58.847 --> 26:00.814
When we were young,
he was so sensitive

26:00.815 --> 26:02.249
about his size.

26:02.250 --> 26:03.883
And even though he was playing
varsity football

26:03.884 --> 26:05.885
In the sixth grade,
I wanted him to feel

26:05.886 --> 26:07.553
like he was still a normal kid.

26:07.554 --> 26:10.191
I spent my life
taking care of him.

26:10.192 --> 26:13.195
You may find this
hard to believe,

26:13.196 --> 26:15.897
but not too long ago,

26:15.898 --> 26:18.734
my life was parties,
women, and cash...

26:18.735 --> 26:21.837
Parties I couldn't get into,
women I could never date,

26:21.838 --> 26:24.539
and cash I never had,
but, yeah, it was bad.

26:24.540 --> 26:26.975
I was "Lost Evan".

26:26.976 --> 26:28.443
I didn't know it at the time,

26:28.444 --> 26:30.779
but I was.

26:30.780 --> 26:33.415
And then Hank's career went down
like the Hindenburg,

26:33.416 --> 26:35.250
and things started looking up.

26:35.251 --> 26:37.819
We moved out here,
and everything changed.

26:37.820 --> 26:39.688
No more "Lost Evan"?

26:39.689 --> 26:45.326
Yeah, but I didn't find myself

26:45.327 --> 26:49.297
and attain Evan R. Lawson,
CFO of HankMed status

26:49.298 --> 26:52.632
until I moved in
with my brother, okay?

26:52.633 --> 26:56.102
I feel like you're not
gonna find yourself

26:56.103 --> 26:57.670
until your leave yours.

27:00.579 --> 27:03.715
Tell Donald.

27:03.716 --> 27:06.551
I don't want to be there
when you do.

27:06.552 --> 27:08.754
[laughs]

27:08.755 --> 27:09.788
But tell him.

27:09.789 --> 27:11.723
[sighs]

27:11.724 --> 27:13.557
Wait here.

27:13.558 --> 27:15.192
I forgot to take my vitamins.

27:15.193 --> 27:17.160
Yeah.

27:17.161 --> 27:20.831
Um, and for the record,

27:20.832 --> 27:23.833
I really like "Found Evan".

27:31.510 --> 27:34.014
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:34.015 --> 27:35.382
What are you doing here?

27:35.383 --> 27:37.517
- Donny invited me.
- Donny?

27:37.518 --> 27:38.685
You call him Donny?

27:38.686 --> 27:40.554
He told me to call him Donny.

27:40.555 --> 27:44.091
So you guys are just
on a Donny basis now?

27:44.092 --> 27:46.859
[laughs]
Wait, are you jealous?

27:46.860 --> 27:48.461
No... I don't know.
I don't know.

27:48.462 --> 27:51.130
Maybe I don't like seeing
other guys make you laugh.

27:51.131 --> 27:52.298
Ah.

27:52.299 --> 27:53.933
Especially not enormous ones
like that guy.

27:53.934 --> 27:56.903
So only you can make me laugh?

27:56.904 --> 27:58.238
Yes.
[laughs]

27:58.239 --> 28:00.273
- I rest my case.
- Okay.

28:00.274 --> 28:02.542
Look, I get it.

28:02.543 --> 28:03.877
I am sure I wouldn't enjoy

28:03.878 --> 28:05.378
watching another woman
make you laugh.

28:05.379 --> 28:09.049
And I wouldn't want to see you
laugh with another woman.

28:09.050 --> 28:10.417
Or call her Donny.

28:10.418 --> 28:12.252
[laughs]
That really bothers you.

28:12.253 --> 28:13.620
Yeah, a little bit.
A little bit.

28:13.621 --> 28:15.422
I'm sure you can call him
Donny too.

28:15.423 --> 28:16.656
All you have to do is ask.

28:16.657 --> 28:18.124
Yeah.
Excuse me one minute.

28:18.125 --> 28:19.726
Well, I didn't mean now.

28:19.727 --> 28:21.227
Hey, you want me to man the grill?

28:21.228 --> 28:23.630
That's kind of a personal
question, don't you think?

28:23.631 --> 28:25.699
- Well, I just thought...
- I'm fine.

28:25.700 --> 28:28.835
That grill won't give you
the same gentle, pillowy cushion

28:28.836 --> 28:29.869
that my torso did.

28:29.870 --> 28:31.337
If you wanna help, here.

28:31.338 --> 28:34.274
Dinner's done.
Carry this to the table.

28:34.275 --> 28:35.575
You have any food for us?

28:35.576 --> 28:40.514
[laughs]
Wise guy.

28:40.515 --> 28:42.416

Yeah, your esophagus

29:50.169 --> 29:51.302
I'm not sure.

29:51.303 --> 29:55.005

30:27.502 --> 30:30.503
Yeah.

30:39.544 --> 30:43.812
Don mentioned that you
lost some weight recently?

30:43.813 --> 30:47.216
Did you have a gastric bypass?

30:47.217 --> 30:49.051
How did you know that?

30:49.052 --> 30:51.586
A guess based on the
concretion I just pulled out,

30:51.587 --> 30:52.920
and I have been wondering

30:52.921 --> 30:56.690
why you've been wearing
long-sleeved shirts in July.

30:56.691 --> 30:59.693
Well, m-my body lost the weight

30:59.694 --> 31:02.995
but forgot to lose
the excess skin.

31:02.996 --> 31:05.364
And I'm guessing you didn't
follow the strict diet

31:05.365 --> 31:06.932
that goes along with that surgery.

31:06.933 --> 31:10.235
I was, but then all this
stuff happened with Donald,

31:10.236 --> 31:13.437
and I just...
I got so worried that...

31:13.438 --> 31:15.205
I kinda went off my diet.

31:15.206 --> 31:16.773
Which led to the acid reflux,

31:16.774 --> 31:18.574
which narrowed your esophagus

31:18.575 --> 31:20.376
and didn't allow much
to get down.

31:20.377 --> 31:22.913
Can a gastric bypass
cause memory loss?

31:22.914 --> 31:25.951
Yeah, you mentioned
Faith had memory issues once?

31:25.952 --> 31:28.053
- Did that happen again?
- Yeah.

31:28.054 --> 31:29.354
And again.
And again.

31:29.355 --> 31:31.089
- Yeah.
- Well, see...

31:31.090 --> 31:33.091
If the body doesn't absorb
enough vitamin B1,

31:33.092 --> 31:34.927
You can suffer
short-term memory loss.

31:34.928 --> 31:36.428
It's called Korsakoff syndrome.

Please tell me that
that sounds worse than it is.

31:40.733 --> 31:42.934
It's very treatable
when caught early

31:42.935 --> 31:45.269
and if you stick to your diet.

31:48.239 --> 31:51.775
Please keep this between us.

38:32.433 --> 38:36.002
We were best friends.

38:36.003 --> 38:38.605
Look in my eyes.

38:41.142 --> 38:45.712
Please.
It's still me.

38:45.713 --> 38:49.316
Look. It's still me.

38:54.088 --> 38:56.156
Just out of curiosity...

38:56.157 --> 38:58.524
Those feet?

38:58.525 --> 39:02.261
Are they the same ones
that walked out on us?

39:02.262 --> 39:04.830
You listen to me, Dr. Smartass,

39:04.831 --> 39:07.466
and you listen good.

39:07.467 --> 39:10.703
I came here with my tail
between my legs,

39:10.704 --> 39:13.072
but apology time is over.

39:13.073 --> 39:14.840
You don't tell me where to live.

39:14.841 --> 39:16.508
You don't tell me who to talk to.

39:16.509 --> 39:19.645
Oh, and by the way,

39:19.646 --> 39:21.814
who the hell are you
to talk to my girlfriend

39:21.815 --> 39:26.118
behind my back...
To warn her about me?

39:26.119 --> 39:27.686
And just for the record,

39:27.687 --> 39:29.989
I'm not going anywhere.

39:29.990 --> 39:32.258
I might have lost one son,

39:32.259 --> 39:36.228
but I sure as hell am not
gonna lose another one.

39:44.436 --> 39:47.004
- It's time...
- To take out...

39:47.005 --> 39:49.272
The trash!

39:49.273 --> 39:50.807
[roars]

39:50.808 --> 39:52.842
Aah!
[thudding]

39:52.843 --> 39:55.411
Yeah, take that, tattoo guy!

40:03.118 --> 40:05.085
Oh... Oh!

40:05.086 --> 40:06.654
I mean... Awesome!

40:06.655 --> 40:09.356
That was so superior
to Garbage Collector III.

40:09.357 --> 40:11.491
Every time I-I...
[stammers]
I'm speechless.

40:11.492 --> 40:12.960
[remote control clatters]

40:12.961 --> 40:14.361
Maybe because you've been
talking to the screen

40:14.362 --> 40:15.862
for the last 90 minutes.

40:15.863 --> 40:17.464
- Yeah. Or yelling at it.
- What about you?

40:17.465 --> 40:19.599
Well, you know, I gotta
admit, it was good, you know?

40:19.600 --> 40:21.634
It was repulsive yet riveting.

40:21.635 --> 40:23.036
Oh, yeah. It's the Citizen Kane

40:23.037 --> 40:24.304
of environmentally correct
slasher films

40:24.305 --> 40:25.839
is what I like to say.

40:25.840 --> 40:28.608
Um, so should I give Boris
the Garbage Collector figurine,

40:28.609 --> 40:30.676
or should I give him
the Garbage Truck?

40:30.677 --> 40:32.111
- What?
- Well, you know,

40:32.112 --> 40:33.880
I'm sure he already owns both.

40:33.881 --> 40:36.682
And Boris is fine.
Don't worry.

40:36.683 --> 40:39.218
- Where you going?
- For a run.

40:39.219 --> 40:40.854
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

40:40.855 --> 40:43.290
Well, you can't run away
from your problems, Hank.

40:43.291 --> 40:46.860
No, Evan, but you can't
fault him for trying.

40:53.067 --> 40:54.267
[tires screech]

40:54.268 --> 40:55.968
Are you okay?

40:55.969 --> 40:57.436
Uh, yeah, yeah.

40:57.437 --> 40:59.405
I'm sorry for sneaking up
on you like that.

40:59.406 --> 41:00.906
And given your taste for speed,

41:00.907 --> 41:02.074
maybe a jet would be

41:02.075 --> 41:04.042
a more appropriate
mode of transportation?

41:04.043 --> 41:06.011
- I am so sorry.
- That's fine.

41:06.012 --> 41:08.046
I hate being late...
I've got a meeting

41:08.047 --> 41:09.547
with Mr. Kuester
Von Jurgens-Ratenicz.

41:09.548 --> 41:11.449
Ooh, "A" for pronunciation.

41:11.450 --> 41:13.518
They don't give A-pluses here?

41:13.519 --> 41:16.087
- Well, it's a tough castle.
- Oh.

41:16.088 --> 41:19.823
So listen, you can park
there or there...Or there.

41:19.824 --> 41:21.325
Okay, okay, yeah.
I think I go tit.

41:21.326 --> 41:22.359
You got it?

41:22.360 --> 41:24.928
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

41:24.929 --> 41:27.064
Try to keep it to under 55, huh?

41:27.065 --> 41:29.233
Will do.

41:33.905 --> 41:37.309
Well, you come very
highly recommended.

41:37.310 --> 41:39.747
Very impressive.
Top of your class.

41:39.748 --> 41:41.549
In... every class.

41:41.550 --> 41:44.553
[laughs]
Yes. I'm a bit of a perfectionist.

41:44.554 --> 41:48.324
It's a blessing and a curse.

41:48.325 --> 41:50.894
So do you have
any other questions?

41:50.895 --> 41:53.130
I think not.

41:53.131 --> 41:55.132
If you wouldn't mind
just reviewing and signing

41:55.133 --> 41:56.967
the nondisclosure agreement.

41:56.968 --> 42:00.237
Absolutely.

42:02.407 --> 42:04.274
You don't care to read it.

42:04.275 --> 42:05.575
I'll be discreet

42:05.576 --> 42:07.375
not because of a piece of paper
I've signed

42:07.376 --> 42:10.110
but because it's good business.

42:10.111 --> 42:12.513
Very good.

42:12.514 --> 42:13.981
I have a feeling
you're going to make

42:13.982 --> 42:16.083
an excellent concierge doctor.
