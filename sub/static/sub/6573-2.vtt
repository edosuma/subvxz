00:09.713 --> 00:12.007
It was over a hundred degrees

00:12.049 --> 00:15.677
on the border of California
and Mexico.

00:15.719 --> 00:18.347
But that was nothing
compared to the temperature

00:18.388 --> 00:21.641
inside George Sr.'s
desert sweat lodge...

00:21.683 --> 00:23.392
So hot.

00:23.434 --> 00:25.854
...where he had gathered
a group of CEOs...

00:25.896 --> 00:28.190
So hot.

00:28.232 --> 00:29.900
...with the promise of
spiritual enlightenment...

00:29.941 --> 00:31.651
Anybody hallucinating yet?

00:31.693 --> 00:34.863
Did anybody else
hear that iguana speak?

00:34.905 --> 00:37.991
...as a stepping stone
to financial empowerment.

00:38.033 --> 00:39.159
Let's kill it.

00:39.201 --> 00:41.828
Okay. They're ready.

00:41.870 --> 00:43.454
Of course, there were
certain occupational hazards.

00:43.496 --> 00:44.789
All right, guys, easy.

00:44.831 --> 00:46.583
- I'm not...
- Kill the iguana.

00:46.624 --> 00:48.626
I'm not an iguana.

00:48.668 --> 00:50.545
It's part of the process.

00:50.587 --> 00:53.382
They're ready.
They're ready!

00:53.423 --> 00:55.092
Now the story

00:55.133 --> 00:58.011
of a family whose future
was abruptly canceled

00:58.053 --> 01:00.013
and the one father
who had no choice

01:00.055 --> 01:02.307
but to keep himself together.

01:05.269 --> 01:08.355
It's George Sr.'s...

01:12.817 --> 01:14.945
George Sr. was
getting ready to motivate

01:14.986 --> 01:18.907
his gathered CEOs
after a narrow brush with death

01:18.949 --> 01:21.410
at the hands
of a Frito-Lay executive.

01:22.452 --> 01:23.954
Yeah!

01:23.995 --> 01:26.790
Now, that was the most
invigorating session yet.

01:26.831 --> 01:28.666
I feel good.

01:28.708 --> 01:30.127
You feel good?

01:30.168 --> 01:32.337
This is George Sr.

01:32.379 --> 01:34.631
I got you.

01:34.672 --> 01:36.049
You know, guys, 
even I, Father B.,

01:36.091 --> 01:37.508
when I first started
these sweat lodges,

01:37.550 --> 01:38.969
I would come
out of there thinking,

01:39.010 --> 01:41.179
oh, God, I wish
I had a... a lemonade.

01:41.221 --> 01:43.014
Just like a child, you know.

01:43.056 --> 01:46.768
Cold water, some lemons, 
a little sugar, you know.

01:46.810 --> 01:49.146
That's what I gave my power to!

01:49.187 --> 01:51.398
Can we have
the teaching pitcher please?

01:51.440 --> 01:52.441
Heartfire.

01:52.482 --> 01:53.524
Hey, guys, this is Heartfire.

01:53.566 --> 01:54.859
She is silent,

01:54.901 --> 01:58.405
but in that silence, 
there is strength.

01:58.447 --> 02:00.531
She needs no words
to communicate to you.

02:04.035 --> 02:06.330
Boundless power
to you, too, Heartfire.

02:06.371 --> 02:08.914
Hell, I was so weak, you guys,

02:08.957 --> 02:13.837
I was willing to spend $10, 000
just a little...

02:14.879 --> 02:16.381
...sip of this lemonade.

02:16.423 --> 02:17.757
Fifteen!

02:17.799 --> 02:20.385
But now I can spend
two hours in brutal heat

02:20.427 --> 02:22.429
with a cup of this
cold, refreshing lemonade

02:22.471 --> 02:24.181
and just pour it in the dirt.

02:24.222 --> 02:25.932
Ah, come on, Daniels!

02:25.974 --> 02:28.185
You ran Bear Stearns, 
for God's sake!

02:28.226 --> 02:29.353
I was like this.

02:29.394 --> 02:31.188
Just like this.

02:31.229 --> 02:33.231
Then I went to the desert
to seek answers,

02:33.273 --> 02:35.233
and now I have them.

02:35.275 --> 02:37.986
Actually, George Sr.
had come to the desert

02:38.028 --> 02:40.280
to escape questions.

02:40.322 --> 02:43.158
Years earlier, after duping
his twin brother Oscar...

02:43.200 --> 02:45.202
- You gave me up, George.
- George? I'm not George.

02:45.243 --> 02:47.037
...into taking his place
at a party

02:47.078 --> 02:49.456
the family held
on the Queen Mary,

02:49.498 --> 02:51.749
George Sr. stowed away
with a son

02:51.791 --> 02:53.502
who was also
fleeing the family.

02:53.542 --> 02:56.087
How was the party?

02:56.129 --> 02:57.546
Mom stole it.

02:57.588 --> 02:59.799
- The whole boat?
- She had.

02:59.841 --> 03:02.219
- As she fled to sea...
- Full steam, boys!

03:02.260 --> 03:05.805
...a strategy
their lawyer's son came up with

03:05.847 --> 03:07.891
on his first day back in
the country after law school.

03:07.932 --> 03:09.434
I'm wondering if
we shouldn't have a plan

03:09.476 --> 03:11.061
in regards to bookkeeping,

03:11.102 --> 03:13.855
in case we accidentally
make a mistake or get caught.

03:13.897 --> 03:18.609
What if we were
to become a... an-an... an NLC?

03:18.651 --> 03:20.945
- Ooh!
- A "No Liability Corporation."

03:20.987 --> 03:22.989
We just have no liability, 
just nothing...

03:23.031 --> 03:26.034
Well, first of all, I would
avoid doing anything illegal.

03:26.076 --> 03:27.202
May I make a suggestion?

03:27.244 --> 03:29.454
- Sure.
- Take to the sea!

03:29.496 --> 03:31.248
Three miles out, 
and it's a free-for-all!

03:31.289 --> 03:33.458
No rules, pirate radio laws.

03:33.500 --> 03:36.627
Really!
Is this true, Mr. Zuckerkorn?

03:36.669 --> 03:38.296
Sure.

03:38.338 --> 03:40.340
So we will stick together
and have

03:40.382 --> 03:42.133
all of our meetings on boats.

03:42.175 --> 03:44.302
Well, uh, I don't know
if that's necessary.

03:44.344 --> 03:46.096
Yeah, because they don't have to
be together, because you can't

03:46.137 --> 03:47.722
try a husband and wife
for the same crime, right?

03:47.764 --> 03:49.474
Sure.

03:49.516 --> 03:51.809
We have the best
 attorneys.

03:51.851 --> 03:53.811
You think we should go back?

03:53.853 --> 03:56.064
Absolutely. She's your mother.

03:56.106 --> 03:57.524
Family has to stick together.

03:57.566 --> 03:59.234
You're afraid
she'll turn on you.

03:59.276 --> 04:01.486
Won't even leave the table
during a dinner party.

04:01.528 --> 04:02.695
Okay.

04:02.737 --> 04:04.448
We're going back, 
George Michael!

04:04.489 --> 04:07.325
It turned out, Lucille had
returned to shore, too.

04:07.367 --> 04:09.244
Why the alleged ship-jacker

04:09.286 --> 04:11.037
changed direction
is still unexplained.

04:11.079 --> 04:13.290
And soon the family met up

04:13.331 --> 04:14.958
at the beginning
of a fourth season...

04:14.999 --> 04:16.834
- My wife, how is she?
- ...that would never come.

04:16.875 --> 04:18.503
She's fine. You're lucky
we didn't have an autumn,

04:18.545 --> 04:19.629
otherwise she'd be colder.

04:19.670 --> 04:20.964
Look what they've done, George!

04:21.005 --> 04:23.216
Look what the homosexuals
have done to me.

04:23.258 --> 04:24.842
A joyride.

04:24.884 --> 04:26.803
That's what they decide to do
with the freedom

04:26.844 --> 04:28.305
this country has given them.

04:28.346 --> 04:30.098
That's the best alibi
I've been able

04:30.140 --> 04:32.267
to come up with, because
our lawyer says he thinks

04:32.309 --> 04:34.811
he can get rid
of the SEC charges,

04:34.852 --> 04:37.772
but he's worried about
the pirating of theQueen Mary.

04:37.814 --> 04:39.732
Says they have
a suit against us.

04:39.774 --> 04:42.277
- Where is Barry?
- He's with the harbormaster.

04:42.319 --> 04:45.238
He's trying to dazzle them
with a suit of his own.

04:45.280 --> 04:47.198
Well, he hated the suit.

04:47.240 --> 04:49.033
Thought I was making fun.

04:49.075 --> 04:52.412
But basically, this is
a "good news/bad news" deal.

04:52.454 --> 04:54.664
First of all, won't be cheap.

04:54.705 --> 04:56.874
It's gonna cost you
a fortune in legal fees.

04:56.916 --> 04:58.918
- What's the good news?
- Oh, yeah.

04:58.960 --> 05:00.587
Well, from your perspective, 
I can see where

05:00.629 --> 05:01.879
you think it's all bad news.

05:01.921 --> 05:03.131
It's all bad news.

05:03.173 --> 05:04.382
Also, it turns out

05:04.424 --> 05:05.925
that stealing theQueen Mary

05:05.967 --> 05:07.427
comes under maritime law,

05:07.469 --> 05:09.720
which, I just found out, 
is an actual thing.

05:09.762 --> 05:10.763
It's a real thing.

05:10.805 --> 05:11.889
Don't you worry.

05:11.931 --> 05:12.932
We got three months

05:12.974 --> 05:14.392
to prepare for this hearing.

05:14.434 --> 05:17.020
And so, George Sr.
went to his competitor,

05:17.061 --> 05:18.855
Stan Sitwell, with an offer,

05:18.896 --> 05:21.650
so he could afford to cover
Lucille's high legal fees.

05:21.691 --> 05:24.444
Buy the rest of your stock?
You got to be kidding me.

05:24.486 --> 05:26.446
I already dumped the stock
I owned to Lucille Austero.

05:26.488 --> 05:28.031
Don't forget, 
I was on that boat.

05:28.072 --> 05:29.407
And believe me, I lost

05:29.449 --> 05:31.493
more than just the 50 grand
on that sale.

05:31.535 --> 05:33.703
I also lost
a perfectly good pair of

05:33.744 --> 05:36.164
human chest hair nipple tufts
when we hit the water.

05:36.206 --> 05:38.707
Stan Sitwell
suffered from alopecia,

05:38.749 --> 05:40.293
a condition
that rendered him hairless.

05:40.335 --> 05:42.629
That's kelp;
why would I put it onto my chest

05:42.671 --> 05:44.130
or head or anywhere else?

05:44.172 --> 05:45.714
I was gonna
show those babies off

05:45.756 --> 05:47.676
- at the Jacuzzi after-party.
- Come on, Stan.

05:47.716 --> 05:49.302
I'm offering you
the chance to double

05:49.344 --> 05:51.224
- the size of your business.
- Way ahead of you.

05:51.262 --> 05:52.763
I've got a big project
coming up.

05:52.805 --> 05:54.641
And even you can't
compete for this one,

05:54.683 --> 05:55.724
with your business in the shape
that it's in.

05:55.766 --> 05:56.809
This is a biggie.

05:56.851 --> 05:57.977
I get this contract,

05:58.019 --> 05:59.563
and it gets government approval,

05:59.604 --> 06:01.147
I'll be bigger than Halliburton.

06:01.189 --> 06:02.773
Well, maybe not Halliburton,

06:02.815 --> 06:04.234
but definitely Halliburton Teen.

06:04.275 --> 06:05.902
Halliburton Teen was a leading

06:05.943 --> 06:08.321
youth and lifestyle retailer, 
despite the fact

06:08.363 --> 06:13.243
that it was a rebranding
of the tarnished Halliburton.

06:13.284 --> 06:14.994
Penitentiary and
Rendition Systems.

06:15.036 --> 06:17.539
It's also how their
deep-water drilling enterprise

06:17.581 --> 06:19.666
spawned this company.

06:21.459 --> 06:22.919
Anyway, you're too late.

06:22.960 --> 06:24.462
The contract is
practically mine.

06:24.504 --> 06:26.964
Even you can't underbid me.

06:27.006 --> 06:29.634
Well, you may have
a bigger business than me,

06:29.676 --> 06:32.596
but you will never have this.

06:32.637 --> 06:34.556
And believe me, 
I'm gonna find out

06:34.598 --> 06:36.933
that project you're working on, 
even if I have to search

06:36.974 --> 06:40.103
the public records
for the blueprints myself.

06:40.144 --> 06:41.730
Unless you search
in this office,

06:41.770 --> 06:43.481
you will never find them.

06:50.614 --> 06:52.449
Oh... aah...!

06:52.490 --> 06:54.743
Ow, my hair!
My beautiful hair!

06:57.870 --> 06:59.664
My hair!
My beautiful hair!

07:02.208 --> 07:03.627
This isn't what it looks like!

07:03.668 --> 07:05.128
Oh, really?

07:05.169 --> 07:08.632
Because it looks like a monument
to George W. Bush.

07:10.049 --> 07:12.385
Well, you got me.

07:12.427 --> 07:14.471
You're in for
a rude awakening, Sitwell.

07:14.512 --> 07:16.097
It'll never stand.

07:16.139 --> 07:18.433
It's too thin.

07:18.475 --> 07:20.810
It'll never stand.

07:20.851 --> 07:23.020
You see, the W's
and the word "bush."

07:23.062 --> 07:24.773
I mean, what else could it be?

07:24.814 --> 07:28.318
You mean other than
a 20-foot-wide monument

07:28.359 --> 07:30.194
that goes five miles
into the sky?

07:30.236 --> 07:32.863
I know, I know. And I told him
it wouldn't stand,

07:32.905 --> 07:35.116
which I probably shouldn't have.

07:35.158 --> 07:38.703
It's a wall, George;
you're looking at it sideways.

07:38.745 --> 07:41.289
The W stands for "wall."

07:41.331 --> 07:42.499
The bushes...

07:42.540 --> 07:44.000
Stand for the bushes.

07:44.041 --> 07:46.336
Ah--this explains
the immigration booth

07:46.377 --> 07:48.129
10, 000 feet in the air.

07:48.171 --> 07:50.465
It's to separate
the U.S. and Mexico,

07:50.507 --> 07:52.717
to keep out the immigrants, 
which was my idea!

07:52.759 --> 07:54.344
Was your idea. I remember.

07:54.385 --> 07:57.221
You said that right after
Lupe got the bleach stain

07:57.263 --> 07:58.723
on your teal blazer.

07:58.765 --> 08:00.850
How did you miss this, George?

08:00.891 --> 08:03.269
This is business we should have.

08:03.311 --> 08:06.105
Is this how you're going to
let it all end, as a failure?

08:06.147 --> 08:07.898
- Is that your plan?
- No.

08:07.940 --> 08:09.609
Of course not.

08:09.651 --> 08:12.612
It was his plan.

08:15.365 --> 08:17.701
George Sr. felt
discouraged and alone...

08:17.742 --> 08:20.244
Bluth for two--I mean, one.

08:20.286 --> 08:21.912
I thought I already seated you.

08:21.954 --> 08:25.249
...when he saw a familiar face:
his own...

08:25.291 --> 08:28.586
...on his twin brother Oscar.

08:28.628 --> 08:30.921
George!
Actually, we came in

08:30.963 --> 08:33.174
to use the bathroom, 
but they sat me.

08:33.216 --> 08:35.510
And they have mahimahi today.

08:35.552 --> 08:37.679
Will you join us?
Will you have a mahimahi on me?

08:37.721 --> 08:39.889
- On you.
- Fine, but I'm gonna

08:39.929 --> 08:42.851
sit opposite you, 
so it won't look bad.

08:42.892 --> 08:45.061
These are my friends; we all
live in the desert together.

08:45.102 --> 08:48.105
This is Heartfire;
she's an aura specialist.

08:48.147 --> 08:49.232
She did Matthew Modine.

08:52.068 --> 08:53.444
I will.

08:53.486 --> 08:55.572
Heartfire would like
some more crackers.

08:55.613 --> 08:57.574
Oscar, you don't believe
that nonsense, do you?

08:57.615 --> 08:59.200
No, no, no. You're a skeptic.

08:59.242 --> 09:01.828
But I'll tell you something, 
the desert changes you.

09:01.870 --> 09:03.913
Dr. Norman is
a disgraced anesthesiologist.

09:03.954 --> 09:05.039
Oh.

09:05.081 --> 09:06.666
The bigger crime would've been

09:06.708 --> 09:08.626
the patient didn't wake up
and testify against me.

09:08.668 --> 09:11.003
But nobody cares about the part
of the oath he kept.

09:11.045 --> 09:12.338
I'll tell you this.

09:12.380 --> 09:14.674
If that nastiness
had never happened,

09:14.716 --> 09:16.217
I never would've gotten
those prison pen pal letters

09:16.259 --> 09:19.095
from the most beautiful woman
in the world.

09:19.136 --> 09:21.890
If he as bad as the
state of California say he is,

09:21.931 --> 09:24.809
then why did I fall in love
with him, huh?

09:24.851 --> 09:26.811
Yo,  the state
of California!

09:26.853 --> 09:28.020
'em!

09:28.062 --> 09:31.941
Bunch of
California , yeah.

09:31.982 --> 09:34.652
As you can imagine, 
her letters really stood out.

09:34.694 --> 09:36.404
Do you know China Garden?

09:36.446 --> 09:38.197
I know the downtown one.

09:38.239 --> 09:39.532
You know, I shouldn't judge.

09:39.574 --> 09:42.118
'Cause you have friends, 
and I...

09:42.159 --> 09:43.536
I envy that.

09:43.578 --> 09:46.915
You're welcome
to my friends, brother.

09:50.167 --> 09:52.754
I don't want these.

09:52.796 --> 09:55.131
But perhaps due to
the absence of Lucille,

09:55.172 --> 09:58.259
the two brothers connected
as they hadn't in years.

09:58.301 --> 10:00.261
I'm not the big man
I thought I was.

10:00.303 --> 10:02.889
Forget the past, George.

10:02.931 --> 10:05.224
I don't know; maybe it's
because I live on the border

10:05.266 --> 10:07.351
between the United States
and Mexico and...

10:07.393 --> 10:09.228
Hold on. Border?

10:09.270 --> 10:11.606
You don't think I live
like this all the time, do you?

10:11.648 --> 10:14.651
That's why I had so much fun
at that party on theQueen Mary.

10:14.692 --> 10:16.903
And you paid for my haircut.

10:16.945 --> 10:19.155
And you made me...
dress like you.

10:19.196 --> 10:20.740
Forget the past.

10:20.782 --> 10:24.661
What were you saying about
that property on the border?

10:24.702 --> 10:26.943
And that's when George Sr.
first saw the desert property.

10:26.955 --> 10:30.291
And the much smaller sweat
lodge that was on the land.

10:30.333 --> 10:32.376
You live here?

10:32.418 --> 10:33.711
Ask him!

10:33.753 --> 10:35.755
Would you like
to watch us make love?

10:35.797 --> 10:36.923
No. You live here?

10:36.965 --> 10:38.508
We have been.

10:38.549 --> 10:41.135
You see, Mexico starts
right at the end of that gully,

10:41.177 --> 10:43.262
and we have to get
in and out of there

10:43.304 --> 10:44.931
so we can get at the maca root.

10:44.973 --> 10:46.599
What the hell is maca root?

10:46.641 --> 10:48.893
It's an ancient Aztec
power herb.

10:48.935 --> 10:50.144
It's an endocrine adaptogen.

10:50.186 --> 10:51.813
It's legal to grow in Mexico,

10:51.855 --> 10:53.940
but it's against the law
to consume it there.

10:53.982 --> 10:56.651
Of course, you can ingest it
here, but you can't grow it.

10:56.693 --> 10:59.654
And... you can bring it
into Mexico,

10:59.696 --> 11:02.239
but you can't bring it out.

11:02.281 --> 11:04.200
So it's, uh, hard.

11:04.241 --> 11:06.076
So you guys are knowingly
breaking the law?

11:06.118 --> 11:09.455
But it's worth it, because maca
has powerful properties,

11:09.497 --> 11:12.166
especially when combined with
an hour in the sweat lodge.

11:12.208 --> 11:15.503
It gets up to 110 degrees
in there.

11:15.545 --> 11:17.045
Sounds fun.

11:17.087 --> 11:19.007
Oh, but you have to do it
with us.

11:19.047 --> 11:21.049
You'll find a power
you didn't know you had.

11:21.091 --> 11:23.887
But, um, you want to do it soon,

11:23.928 --> 11:28.182
because they're
kicking us off of the land.

11:28.224 --> 11:29.642
I'm sorry.

11:29.684 --> 11:31.561
Oh, great.
Now you're gonna make me cry.

11:31.602 --> 11:33.021
Oh, lizard! Look!
Look, a lizard!

11:33.061 --> 11:34.188
Cute!

11:34.230 --> 11:35.857
What if I were to buy
this land?

11:35.899 --> 11:37.984
I don't understand;
why would you want to do that?

11:38.026 --> 11:41.404
Well, I always talk about
being a great man.

11:41.445 --> 11:44.281
Maybe a way to do that is
not by being

11:44.323 --> 11:46.367
the biggest businessman in
Southern California, it's...

11:46.409 --> 11:50.038
It's by being the best brother
in Southern California.

11:50.078 --> 11:51.956
George Sr. was going to say,

11:51.998 --> 11:54.417
"By gouging the government
when they needed the land..."

11:54.458 --> 11:55.752
You bet.

11:55.793 --> 11:58.212
Hey, guys, we're staying.

11:58.254 --> 11:59.589
Oh, thank you, brother.

11:59.630 --> 12:00.965
...but he'd save that
for Lucille.

12:01.007 --> 12:03.843
- Thank you, maca.
- Thank you, maca!

12:03.885 --> 12:05.469
And I can get this land
for a song.

12:05.511 --> 12:06.888
George was proud of his plan.

12:06.930 --> 12:08.014
Are you listening to me?

12:08.056 --> 12:09.891
So are those cameras, George.

12:09.933 --> 12:11.350
We can't use the same cameras

12:11.392 --> 12:13.603
from when he was under
house arrest?

12:13.644 --> 12:15.688
These are from
the maritime penal system.

12:15.730 --> 12:17.815
They make us use
the waterproof ones.

12:17.857 --> 12:19.358
- In here.
- Okay.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.109
We're gonna sell that land

12:21.151 --> 12:22.612
to the government
for Sitwell's wall,

12:22.653 --> 12:24.238
and I'm gonna take the cash.

12:24.280 --> 12:26.866
I am gonna mount a case
that shows that my wife

12:26.908 --> 12:28.868
is not the power-hungry monster

12:28.910 --> 12:31.370
the SEC wants
to make her out to be.

12:31.412 --> 12:33.831
You're such a puny thinker.

12:33.873 --> 12:35.165
Am I puny-thinking again?

12:35.207 --> 12:36.459
Sitwell's wall?

12:36.500 --> 12:38.461
How about our wall?
We build the wall.

12:38.502 --> 12:40.755
We do have the plan.

12:40.797 --> 12:42.799
He says he can build it
for $200 million,

12:42.840 --> 12:44.926
we offer to build it
for $150 million,

12:44.968 --> 12:47.762
and we make up the difference
when we sell the land.

12:47.804 --> 12:51.682
And I use that cash
as a little stimulus for us.

12:51.724 --> 12:53.476
Maybe a little something
for the family.

12:53.517 --> 12:55.352
And we build that sucker...

12:55.394 --> 12:56.646
That's my Georgie!

12:56.687 --> 12:57.772
...five miles high.

12:57.814 --> 12:59.983
Long. Five miles long.

13:00.024 --> 13:03.527
I got nothing in my system
but a maca root cookie.

13:03.569 --> 13:05.488
So, that one's all set.

13:05.529 --> 13:07.281
Uh... can I put one up there?

13:07.323 --> 13:10.743
Only if you want to see the
sexiest video you've ever seen.

13:12.328 --> 13:15.414
Sorry I gave you
the old noodle stab in there.

13:15.456 --> 13:18.459
I needed
something in my system.

13:18.501 --> 13:21.462
You know, we can't look like
we're in cahoots on this.

13:21.504 --> 13:23.673
Especially with my trial
coming up.

13:23.714 --> 13:25.049
Yeah, that's right.

13:25.091 --> 13:27.135
We have to separate our assets.

13:27.175 --> 13:28.511
To protect this.

13:28.552 --> 13:31.221
To protect our love.

13:31.263 --> 13:32.903
And that's
when they got the idea

13:32.932 --> 13:36.393
to pretend they were
getting a divorce.

13:36.435 --> 13:38.354
We're getting a divorce.

13:38.395 --> 13:40.064
I want to know about
the stimulus package.

13:40.106 --> 13:42.733
We haven't had sex
since Christmas, Michael!

13:42.775 --> 13:45.069
Uh... I'm... I'm sorry.

13:45.111 --> 13:47.947
You had sex seven weeks ago?

13:47.989 --> 13:50.992
They were remodeling my room, 
and I pulled my cot in there,

13:51.034 --> 13:53.327
- just like camp.
- We yelled at you to leave.

13:53.369 --> 13:55.210
Yeah, but then you whispered, 
"Don't pull out!"

13:57.205 --> 13:59.542
You didn't want to use
any of that money for...

14:01.460 --> 14:04.505
You couldn't use any of that
money to finish Sudden Valley?

14:04.547 --> 14:06.632
And although their plan
was dealt a minor setback

14:06.674 --> 14:08.801
when Michael sold
the controlling shares

14:08.843 --> 14:10.928
to Lucille 2...

14:10.970 --> 14:12.972
You know what?
I am done with this family.

14:13.014 --> 14:14.348
I hope you've saved some money,

14:14.390 --> 14:16.308
'cause you're gonna need
every dime now.

14:16.350 --> 14:17.727
...all they had to do

14:17.768 --> 14:19.520
was keep their plan
a secret from her

14:19.562 --> 14:21.022
and cash in quickly.

14:21.064 --> 14:23.191
4:28 in the morning
here in the O.C.

14:23.232 --> 14:24.775
I'm John Beard.

14:24.817 --> 14:26.861
Well, there was some more
grim economic news today.

14:26.903 --> 14:28.445
The housing prices
continue to plummet,

14:28.487 --> 14:30.531
and the economists say
it may take quite some--

14:30.573 --> 14:32.282
What are you...
what are you doing?

14:32.324 --> 14:35.285
I'm John Beard, 
and I'm a Gloomy Gus.

14:35.327 --> 14:36.954
I don't have a mustache.

14:36.996 --> 14:38.998
And the government
put the wall project on hold.

14:39.040 --> 14:40.624
Can't be on hold.

14:40.666 --> 14:43.044
They already gave me the money
to start the building.

14:43.086 --> 14:45.796
No! I cannot live off of that!

14:45.838 --> 14:49.133
No, I already used that money
as the down payment

14:49.175 --> 14:51.177
of six square miles of desert

14:51.219 --> 14:53.303
I cannot afford
to make payments on!

14:54.471 --> 14:56.933
Oh, God... sorry, Norman.

14:58.350 --> 14:59.685
Huh?

14:59.727 --> 15:00.937
Uh, nothing.

15:00.978 --> 15:02.980
Hey, brother, you seem tense.

15:03.022 --> 15:04.481
Come with me to the sweat lodge.

15:04.523 --> 15:06.525
Sweat out this frustration;
you can learn on this.

15:06.567 --> 15:08.861
And perhaps
it was a sense of futility

15:08.903 --> 15:11.614
or the fact he hadn't
brought a book to the desert,

15:11.655 --> 15:16.452
but George Sr. chose to enter
the small, smoke-filled room,

15:16.493 --> 15:18.537
while his wife
was also confined

15:18.579 --> 15:20.372
to a smoke-filled room,

15:20.414 --> 15:23.333
having found a way around
both the building's strict

15:23.375 --> 15:24.919
no-smoking policy...

15:27.171 --> 15:30.258
...and the fact that her ankle
monitor prevented her

15:30.299 --> 15:33.219
from approaching the balcony.

15:33.261 --> 15:36.388
So, anyways, I went down
to the club and I... I can't...

15:38.000 --> 15:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15:45.815 --> 15:48.109
My food was gone, I could...

15:48.151 --> 15:51.946
That restaurant, typically, 
has a really nice maitre d'...

16:01.789 --> 16:04.416
Can't really remember
the host's name,

16:04.458 --> 16:06.627
but he was...
he was kind of in his 60s...

16:18.555 --> 16:20.683
I have to stop.

16:20.724 --> 16:23.519
I have to stop. So...

16:25.938 --> 16:27.815
But, finally, I just ordered...

16:27.857 --> 16:30.151
pastrami shortcake, like I said, 
but I didn't order...

16:30.193 --> 16:32.195
I didn't order sprinkles this--
Oh, Mother, please.

16:32.236 --> 16:33.737
Please.

16:33.779 --> 16:36.406
Meanwhile, 
in George Sr.'s sweat lodge,

16:36.448 --> 16:39.660
a solution to his problems
was emerging, as well...

16:39.702 --> 16:41.370
Kind of hot, huh?

16:43.122 --> 16:46.416
I'd give $10, 000 for a glass
of lemonade right now.

16:46.458 --> 16:48.585
...in the form of a vision.

16:50.546 --> 16:55.509
Sweat... and squeeze.

16:57.094 --> 16:59.263
It was to be
a "sweat and squeeze."

16:59.305 --> 17:00.681
Dr. Norman?

17:00.723 --> 17:03.267
Dr. Norman, we have a hot mess.

17:05.728 --> 17:07.188
George Sr. had been passed out

17:07.230 --> 17:10.066
for two days
after having a vision...

17:10.107 --> 17:13.652
which is why this seat was
empty at his wife's trial.

17:13.694 --> 17:15.905
But soon, 
he was hard at work...

17:15.945 --> 17:18.156
Okay, look up large mud huts.

17:18.199 --> 17:19.782
- ...making his vision a reality.
- Can fit 20.

17:19.825 --> 17:21.743
Do a something search.
Um, used is fine.

17:21.785 --> 17:24.121
No, no, I got it.

17:24.163 --> 17:25.164
Sweat caves.

17:25.205 --> 17:26.374
See what you get.

17:27.540 --> 17:29.001
You got 'em?

17:29.043 --> 17:30.419
All right, well, then, ship it!

17:30.460 --> 17:32.629
A sweat lodge, 
where he could be

17:32.671 --> 17:36.592
a preacher of profit to other
type-A executives like himself.

17:36.633 --> 17:38.302
All right, this whole area here,

17:38.344 --> 17:40.721
this is going to be
visitor yurts.

17:40.763 --> 17:45.226
Oh, and we're gonna need
industrial-size juicers!

17:45.268 --> 17:47.353
He went to work
on constructing a seminar,

17:47.395 --> 17:50.064
much of which he borrowed
from his brief stint

17:50.106 --> 17:51.982
as a Jewish-y guru
while in prison.

17:52.024 --> 17:53.984
Now's your chance
to own the entire

17:54.026 --> 17:55.736
George Bluth
"Caged Wisdom" library...

17:55.778 --> 17:57.529
Will you read that back
to me, please?

17:57.571 --> 17:59.907
This time, however, he needed
to be actually ordained

17:59.949 --> 18:01.617
as a religious preacher
to avoid tax implications.

18:01.658 --> 18:03.286
Lemonade!

18:03.327 --> 18:05.537
But fortunately, there was
a Phoenix for him, too.

18:05.579 --> 18:07.206
Almost there. Question three.

18:07.248 --> 18:09.458
But business
really took off when

18:09.499 --> 18:12.378
an article about George Sr.'s
operation appeared

18:12.420 --> 18:15.965
in an exclusively first-class
in-flight magazine.

18:16.006 --> 18:19.051
And soon the retreat was up
and running, and George Sr.

18:19.093 --> 18:20.886
was determined
to create the illusion

18:20.928 --> 18:23.555
of a first-class experience.

18:23.597 --> 18:26.434
And did you want the partial
bush or broken gate view?

18:26.516 --> 18:29.519
The seminar was
reasonably priced at $1, 000.

18:29.561 --> 18:31.814
The sweat and squeeze
was simple.

18:31.855 --> 18:35.359
First, George Sr. sweated out
his acolytes' defenses...

18:35.401 --> 18:36.735
Ah, come on, Daniels!

18:36.777 --> 18:38.862
You ran Bear Stearns, 
for God's sake!

18:38.904 --> 18:40.197
I was like this.

18:40.239 --> 18:42.532
Then I went to the desert
to seek answers,

18:42.574 --> 18:45.161
and now I have them.

18:45.202 --> 18:47.621
...and then it was time
for the squeeze.

18:47.663 --> 18:50.833
And for another 15 grand, 
you can have them, too.

18:50.874 --> 18:52.918
I'll teach you
how to get yachts,

18:52.960 --> 18:55.545
I'll teach you how
to get penthouses,

18:55.587 --> 18:57.840
and how to get
something for yourself

18:57.881 --> 19:01.593
by taking it from someone
who thinks it's his.

19:01.635 --> 19:04.138
Does it come with lemonade?

19:04.180 --> 19:06.182
It comes with all the lemonade
you can drink.

19:06.223 --> 19:07.141
"Squeeze" had two meanings.

19:07.183 --> 19:08.309
Who's in?

19:08.351 --> 19:11.228
Sign 'em up. Sign 'em up.

19:11.270 --> 19:13.189
Come on, get your
wallets out, let's go, guys.

19:13.230 --> 19:15.524
And George Sr.
had even found a great way

19:15.565 --> 19:18.361
- to handle the heat.
- Hey.

19:18.402 --> 19:19.695
Hey.

19:19.736 --> 19:21.280
He had his twin brother
endure it.

19:21.322 --> 19:23.073
Did you bring me some lemonade?

19:23.115 --> 19:26.035
No, sir.
It is crazy out there.

19:26.076 --> 19:28.745
For the first time we are out.

19:28.787 --> 19:31.540
Look what I brought you, 
Mr. Oscar--

19:31.581 --> 19:33.876
50 bucks--your half.

19:33.917 --> 19:36.879
Oh, you know, 
I feel bad taking this.

19:36.920 --> 19:38.839
All I did was sit and sweat.

19:38.881 --> 19:40.257
Which is why it seemed

19:40.299 --> 19:42.134
that Father B. was so resilient

19:42.176 --> 19:46.222
to the depleting effects
of the sweat lodge.

19:48.391 --> 19:50.809
Whoo! Yeah!

19:50.851 --> 19:54.688
Now, that was the most
invigorating session yet.

19:54.730 --> 19:59.527
Hey, buddy, come on, 
it's happening, you know.

19:59.568 --> 20:01.320
We're helping people.

20:01.362 --> 20:05.241
- - If I could give you
just one note, little energy.

20:05.282 --> 20:07.576
As the retreat grew,

20:07.617 --> 20:10.787
George Sr. was finding himself
emboldened with power,

20:10.829 --> 20:13.374
while Oscar was bushed.

20:13.416 --> 20:15.584
Hey, Oscar, that scared me.

20:15.625 --> 20:17.127
Come on, man, get back in there.

20:17.169 --> 20:18.670
I was starting to sweat.

20:18.712 --> 20:20.756
I'm just trying
to get my strength up.

20:20.797 --> 20:22.049
Maca usually gets me there.

20:22.091 --> 20:24.634
Hey, chew some maca with me.

20:24.676 --> 20:27.012
I can't, okay, I got to go up
to see Lucille tomorrow.

20:27.054 --> 20:28.556
George Sr. had been meeting

20:28.597 --> 20:31.725
with Lucille on a weekly basis
at her new home

20:31.767 --> 20:34.103
under the pretense
of working on their divorce.

20:34.144 --> 20:35.145
You look nice.

20:35.187 --> 20:36.397
Oh, stop trying to butter me up.

20:36.439 --> 20:38.315
Let's just get
this divorce agreed to

20:38.357 --> 20:39.816
so you can get out of here.

20:41.318 --> 20:42.570
Oh, God.

20:42.611 --> 20:43.653
It's almost
like adultery this way.

20:43.695 --> 20:45.364
Good, I like that.

20:45.406 --> 20:47.741
- "My wife doesn't understand me."
- My angel.

20:49.785 --> 20:53.122
"I haven't had an orgasm outside
of my bathtub in 30 years."

20:53.163 --> 20:55.541
How's that?

20:55.583 --> 20:58.001
Although, at times,
I do wish it were darker.

20:58.043 --> 21:01.130
It's too bad you don't
have time to try this.

21:01.171 --> 21:02.798
Yesterday, 
I was talking to a lizard,

21:02.839 --> 21:05.175
and it turned into
Elizabeth Taylor.

21:05.217 --> 21:07.428
- Young Elizabeth Taylor?
- Uh-huh.

21:07.470 --> 21:09.054
Yeah, I could use some maca.

21:09.096 --> 21:10.556
Give me some of that.

21:10.598 --> 21:14.435
And soon a vision did appear.

21:14.477 --> 21:16.103
I don't know what's going on.

21:16.145 --> 21:20.107
For some reason I'm just getting
Richard Burton today.

21:20.149 --> 21:22.359
Oh, my God, what's that?

21:22.401 --> 21:23.735
That's the commode.

21:23.777 --> 21:25.195
Are you at all concerned
that the maca bush

21:25.237 --> 21:26.477
is directly downhill from that?

21:26.489 --> 21:28.115
He should have been,

21:28.157 --> 21:31.285
but Oscar was actually
referring to what now appeared

21:31.327 --> 21:35.205
to be a divine spirit, 
personified as an ostrich.

21:35.247 --> 21:37.249
You trespass on sacred ground.

21:37.291 --> 21:39.627
The spirits command me
to warn you.

21:39.668 --> 21:42.546
You must leave this land
or the land will change you.

21:42.588 --> 21:44.465
Don't worry, he's probably

21:44.507 --> 21:46.800
from a local reservation.
I'll, I'll take care of this.

21:46.842 --> 21:50.971
How about you book me two nights
for Ray Romano at your casino?

21:51.013 --> 21:55.601
The strong will become the weak, 
the weak will become the strong.

21:55.643 --> 21:58.312
And get us close to the front
but not close enough

21:58.354 --> 22:00.397
that Ray talks to us.

22:00.439 --> 22:02.274
You have been warned.

22:04.151 --> 22:05.528
See ya.

22:07.237 --> 22:10.616
I don't know what you saw, but
I got an ostrich and no boner.

22:14.620 --> 22:16.288
One year after George Sr. had

22:16.330 --> 22:18.207
the incident
with the ostrich guy,

22:18.248 --> 22:20.167
things had indeed started
to change.

22:20.209 --> 22:21.710
Where was I? Um... oh, yeah.

22:21.751 --> 22:23.379
Father B. had lost his command
over the crowd.

22:23.420 --> 22:26.756
Who would like some lemonade
for $2, 000?

22:27.966 --> 22:30.927
Come on, guys, 
I looked the other way

22:30.969 --> 22:33.055
on the bottled water
because you look thirsty,

22:33.096 --> 22:35.182
but you got to play along here.
Heartfire?

22:36.600 --> 22:37.851
Where's the lemonade?

22:37.893 --> 22:39.562
Shh!

22:39.603 --> 22:42.481
And as business slowed down...

22:42.523 --> 22:43.482
Will you excuse me just one sec?

22:43.524 --> 22:44.941
...Oscar had started being

22:44.983 --> 22:47.528
more independent
and harder to find.

22:47.570 --> 22:49.488
Norman, have you seen Oscar?

22:49.530 --> 22:50.656
No, have you seen China Garden?

22:50.698 --> 22:51.657
No.

22:51.699 --> 22:52.991
Did you kill that armadillo?

22:53.033 --> 22:54.702
No, no, he's just under.

22:54.742 --> 22:57.621
If only we could use some of
his medicine for our own pain.

22:57.663 --> 23:01.667
Oh, wait, I've got
a full syringe in the car.

23:01.709 --> 23:03.544
And George Sr. would soon get

23:03.586 --> 23:05.087
worse economic news from
his attorney.

23:05.128 --> 23:06.589
Oh, this can't be good.

23:06.630 --> 23:08.006
I mean, you didn't drive all

23:08.048 --> 23:09.508
this distance for good news.

23:09.550 --> 23:11.051
You've got a balloon payment due

23:11.093 --> 23:12.969
on the mortgage
on this property.

23:13.011 --> 23:14.096
It's about $15 million.

23:14.137 --> 23:15.763
I mean, I-- what am I gonna do?

23:15.805 --> 23:17.391
Where am I gonna get that money?

23:17.433 --> 23:19.351
I thought you were going to sell
the land to the government

23:19.393 --> 23:20.686
to build the wall.

23:20.728 --> 23:22.062
Yeah, but that was put on hold.

23:22.104 --> 23:24.106
So?
It's election time.

23:24.147 --> 23:27.067
Now's the time to get a
politician to push for the wall.

23:27.109 --> 23:29.695
Isn't that dizzy kook
Lucille Austero running?

23:29.737 --> 23:31.447
No, no, she, 
she can't know about this.

23:31.488 --> 23:34.824
She's the majority owner
of my company,

23:34.866 --> 23:36.076
and besides, 
she's so pro-immigrant.

23:36.118 --> 23:37.703
She was.

23:37.745 --> 23:40.330
She'd even taken in
a Latino foster child,

23:40.372 --> 23:44.000
which she denied was an attempt
to bring in the Hispanic vote.

23:44.042 --> 23:46.336
Nonetheless, she did know what
cultural buttons to push

23:46.378 --> 23:48.088
to win their hearts.

23:48.130 --> 23:49.839
Doesn't matter,
she's not going to win anyway.

23:49.881 --> 23:52.551
The guy you want is the guy
she's running against--

23:52.593 --> 23:54.177
Herbert Love, right?

23:54.219 --> 23:55.596
He's got a rally tonight.

23:55.638 --> 23:56.930
Go and see him.

23:56.972 --> 23:59.849
Everyone knows how persuasive
you can be.

23:59.891 --> 24:01.184
Used to be.

24:01.226 --> 24:03.395
I'd be lucky to sell
a glass of lemonade

24:03.437 --> 24:04.980
for a thousand dollars today.

24:05.021 --> 24:05.981
Now, listen.

24:06.022 --> 24:07.941
If I can take no more

24:07.983 --> 24:10.818
than a law degree
from the Virgin Islands...

24:10.860 --> 24:13.405
- Yeah.
- ...a-a-and turn it into a net worth

24:13.447 --> 24:16.408
of $750, 000--

24:16.450 --> 24:18.201
before, of course, 
what I owe in lawsuits--

24:18.243 --> 24:21.997
you can talk a politician into
wasting public funds on a wall.

24:22.038 --> 24:24.124
Wait, wait, 
that rally is tonight?

24:24.166 --> 24:25.417
- Mm-hmm.
- But I'm supposed

24:25.459 --> 24:27.043
to meet my wife tonight,

24:27.085 --> 24:28.378
which I am dreading, by the way.

24:28.420 --> 24:30.213
One of the changes

24:30.255 --> 24:32.174
that had occurred
over the previous year...

24:32.215 --> 24:34.802
- My right rear tire is low.
- ...was a decrease

24:34.842 --> 24:38.888
in the physical intimacy George
Sr. and his wife had enjoyed.

24:38.930 --> 24:42.017
You're so ugly from behind.

24:44.269 --> 24:46.647
'Cause if no one
shows up at that office,

24:46.689 --> 24:48.440
she really will divorce me.

24:48.482 --> 24:50.066
Too bad you can't use a double.

24:50.108 --> 24:51.568
Oh, also I used a look-alike

24:51.610 --> 24:54.530
named Stewart to take
the California bar for me.

24:54.571 --> 24:55.905
But you knew that, right?

24:58.158 --> 25:00.035
- Oscar.
- And later,

25:00.076 --> 25:02.538
while once again looking
for his own double...

25:02.579 --> 25:05.749
- Oscar.
- ...George, who was acting more like Oscar,

25:05.791 --> 25:08.711
finally found Oscar, who was
acting more like George.

25:08.752 --> 25:09.712
Why aren't you sweating?

25:09.753 --> 25:11.839
Maybe I had a better offer.

25:11.879 --> 25:14.090
And not a word to Dr. Norman.

25:14.132 --> 25:16.134
He doesn't think
women should be awake for it.

25:16.176 --> 25:18.094
"Oh, great Dr. Norman."

25:18.136 --> 25:20.972
You know, we have
to be very careful.

25:21.014 --> 25:23.183
Oscar, we are trying
to help people here.

25:23.225 --> 25:25.394
I know, I know, I know, 
but you know what?

25:25.435 --> 25:29.189
It just gets hot
in there sometimes!

25:29.231 --> 25:31.983
Whoa, we don't, 
we don't have to yell.

25:32.025 --> 25:35.738
Why not you go do hot sweat, 
let Oscar do squeeze?

25:35.779 --> 25:37.698
All right, I mean, 
I'm not saying that.

25:37.740 --> 25:40.409
I just, uh, I need a break.

25:40.450 --> 25:42.160
I just can't go on

25:42.202 --> 25:45.664
- pretending to be you, sitting silently...
- Shh.

25:45.706 --> 25:49.251
...in a, in a 100-degree mud hut
for an hour and a half.

25:49.292 --> 25:52.170
I am begging you--
there has to be something else

25:52.212 --> 25:55.298
I can impersonate you doing.

25:57.718 --> 25:59.469
It's funny you should say that

25:59.511 --> 26:03.599
because, uh, if you're okay
with the sitting silently part,

26:03.640 --> 26:05.601
I have something for you
that's quite chilling.

26:05.642 --> 26:07.977
- Thank you.
- And so George Sr. left

26:08.019 --> 26:10.689
to seek out the right-wing
politician Herbert Love

26:10.731 --> 26:14.693
as Oscar headed out to visit
Lucille, disguised as George,

26:14.735 --> 26:16.570
which is exactly
who Barry thought

26:16.612 --> 26:18.280
he was talking to.

26:18.321 --> 26:20.156
I just pooped in a hole
and covered it up.

26:20.198 --> 26:21.909
I hope I did the right thing.

26:21.949 --> 26:23.535
There's a commode.

26:23.577 --> 26:25.287
It's, it's directly uphill
from the maca root.

26:25.328 --> 26:27.539
Yeah, I really feel bad
for the guy that's got

26:27.581 --> 26:30.125
to dig that up
for the foundation for the wall.

26:31.919 --> 26:34.504
Yeah, wha-what wall?

26:35.505 --> 26:37.006
Very good, George.

26:37.048 --> 26:39.802
We got to be careful
where we talk about this.

26:39.843 --> 26:41.845
Ooh, I got to watch my words.

26:41.887 --> 26:44.514
And that's when
Oscar realized that George Sr.

26:44.556 --> 26:46.266
didn't buy the land

26:46.308 --> 26:50.353
to be the best brother
in Southern California.

26:53.022 --> 26:57.193
We 12publishes
a rare retraction.

26:57.235 --> 27:00.489
Oscar confirms his suspicions
of the wall

27:00.530 --> 27:01.730
while impersonating George Sr.

27:01.740 --> 27:03.366
I thought we...

27:03.408 --> 27:05.577
I thought
we could talk about the wall.

27:06.578 --> 27:08.872
You know, the wall.

27:08.914 --> 27:10.791
Have you baked your brain
in that pizza oven,

27:10.833 --> 27:12.334
or is senility your backup plan

27:12.375 --> 27:14.962
if we can't get the government
to buy the property?

27:15.002 --> 27:17.756
So we only did buy
that land for personal gain.

27:17.798 --> 27:20.884
Well,  what Oscar does-doesn't know

27:20.926 --> 27:22.051
won't hurt him.

27:22.093 --> 27:23.428
Oscar.

27:23.470 --> 27:24.596
And although it wasn't

27:24.638 --> 27:26.264
a perfect impersonation...

27:26.306 --> 27:28.057
I love it when you call my name.

27:28.099 --> 27:29.351
...he did have the maca root.

27:29.392 --> 27:31.269
George!

27:31.311 --> 27:32.479
Don't call me that.

27:33.480 --> 27:36.023
Call me Father B.
