WEBVTT

00:00.707 --> 00:03.177
We have another case.
It could be a busload.

00:06.046 --> 00:08.390
There's nothing to worry about,
you're being put in quarantine.

00:08.474 --> 00:10.310
But the girl she was sitting next to,

00:10.352 --> 00:11.801
the one you're looking at,

00:11.802 --> 00:14.943
had contact with just about
everyone who's gotten sick.

00:14.985 --> 00:17.323
My dad came up with
the idea to make a clone.

00:17.364 --> 00:20.203
He used you to save your brother.

00:20.286 --> 00:23.041
Okay people, I've got samples.

00:23.083 --> 00:24.920
We might have patient zero.

00:24.961 --> 00:26.923
- She was at the lab?
- She works there.

00:27.007 --> 00:29.553
- Here's my birth certificate.
- This can't be right.

00:29.636 --> 00:32.642
My mother died 2 years before
I was born, Dr. Sandstrom.

00:32.683 --> 00:35.564
Get me the samples. But I mean it,
you stay away from my daughter.

00:35.647 --> 00:38.360
Caroline took me to her office, asked me
all kinds of questions about Hira.

00:38.444 --> 00:40.155
- Her family, her brothers.
- Where the hell is it?

00:40.239 --> 00:41.700
Holy shit.

00:41.783 --> 00:44.789
siRNA is like this imperial guard

00:44.872 --> 00:47.877
except in Miranda's case it's
not in her throat.

00:47.919 --> 00:50.382
- So, the baby's patient zero.
- How do you tell a mother

00:50.465 --> 00:53.387
her baby's going to live in quarantine
for the rest of her life?

00:53.471 --> 00:57.144
- All he wants is the truth.
- Somebody should tell him the truth.

00:57.704 --> 00:58.935
But will you?

00:59.941 --> 01:01.596
There's no hope?

01:04.783 --> 01:06.619
Oh shit.

1x03- The Face of God

03:16.269 --> 03:18.047
Young lady, would you put
your mask on please?

03:27.474 --> 03:29.004
I'm Dr Sandstrom's daughter.

04:07.360 --> 04:08.684
Hi.

04:09.868 --> 04:10.584
Hi.

04:15.750 --> 04:17.378
So, are you going to die or what?

04:18.762 --> 04:20.432
Oh, you're not going to be that lucky.

04:21.051 --> 04:22.609
That's not funny.

04:23.927 --> 04:24.459
Sorry.

04:30.115 --> 04:31.737
Uh, the Ebola

04:31.779 --> 04:36.120
shows up around 14 hours
after exposure, so...

04:37.915 --> 04:40.410
Okay, and where are you?

04:40.586 --> 04:42.975
Almost there.

04:44.218 --> 04:45.455
Almost what, dad?

04:46.862 --> 04:50.145
Another 10, maybe 9 hours,
we'll know for sure.

04:54.736 --> 04:58.785
Whether you're going to like,
live or die or whatever, I guess.

04:58.869 --> 05:00.580
Yeah.

05:11.683 --> 05:15.273
So, uh... are you scared or...?

05:17.903 --> 05:21.409
Lilith, I want you to go home
to your mom, okay?

05:23.788 --> 05:25.625
That is so fucked up.

05:25.709 --> 05:27.670
Lilith, I don't want to argue about this.

05:27.712 --> 05:29.382
You could be dying

05:31.249 --> 05:32.888
and all you have to say to me

05:32.972 --> 05:35.893
is go home to your mum's?

05:35.977 --> 05:37.855
I don't know what you want me to say!

05:37.939 --> 05:41.111
You want me to tell you
that I'm going to be all right?

05:41.195 --> 05:43.099
You want me to lie to you?
I don't know!

05:45.828 --> 05:47.957
I don't know.

05:58.643 --> 06:01.022
Well, okay then.

06:06.782 --> 06:08.285
Uh, I have my cell phone so...

06:08.368 --> 06:11.290
I guess if I don't hear from you
then I'll...

06:11.374 --> 06:13.503
No, no. Lilith.

06:50.527 --> 06:52.406
Is that his blood?

06:52.447 --> 06:54.159
As much as he'd give me.

06:54.200 --> 06:56.162
Yeah, not your model patient type.

06:56.204 --> 06:59.251
David Sandstrom in a quarantine box.
What do you think?

06:59.335 --> 07:02.716
I want a full sweep. Any sign
of tissue factor, I want to know it.

07:02.799 --> 07:04.886
And if there is a sign?

07:05.429 --> 07:09.060
We do everything we can, Mayko.

08:22.275 --> 08:24.237
"This is my near death experience.

08:24.320 --> 08:26.992
"What have I learned? Nothing.
What am I feeling? Nothing.

08:27.033 --> 08:30.618
"What am I thinking? Nothing.
What the fuck is wrong with me?"

08:32.001 --> 08:34.171
Everything.

08:38.220 --> 08:41.601
Now, I had to guess.
Size 16 shirt,

08:41.684 --> 08:43.730
32x32 pants,

08:44.147 --> 08:46.735
boxers I would imagine, medium.

08:46.777 --> 08:50.456
Size 9 shoe. Did I get it right?

08:52.168 --> 08:55.125
No deadly virus floating in
those veins, David.

08:57.797 --> 09:00.802
I was just getting used to being dead.

09:00.844 --> 09:02.792
Well, you're all clear.

09:07.842 --> 09:09.379
I've seen worse...

09:10.570 --> 09:12.840
and I've worn worse.

09:14.660 --> 09:16.789
You really had me scared, David.

09:17.624 --> 09:20.337
All of us.

09:20.421 --> 09:22.717
You think I'm an asshole, right?

09:24.437 --> 09:26.965
I'd do it all over again.

09:28.393 --> 09:30.898
She needed to know the truth, Caroline.

09:30.940 --> 09:33.027
She needed to kill her baby?

10:10.427 --> 10:12.431
You don't understand.

10:12.472 --> 10:15.052
The Institute Pasteur in Paris
has done extensive work on Ebola.

10:15.193 --> 10:18.680
- They need to be brought into this.
- Not going to happen, Carlos.

10:18.901 --> 10:22.490
Why in God's name would you not want
all the help that you can get?

10:22.532 --> 10:24.995
Two words: National Security.

10:25.078 --> 10:28.459
Look, if I'm going to sell them,
you're going to have to sell me.

10:28.501 --> 10:30.964
Let me show you something.

10:31.006 --> 10:33.797
Mayko, put up the Ebola MS data.

10:35.430 --> 10:38.728
This is the sequence of the virus
the baby was carrying.

10:38.769 --> 10:41.232
It's totally repetitive.
The genome must be completely unstable.

10:41.316 --> 10:43.361
Look, there and there. It's weird.

10:43.403 --> 10:45.532
And the Ebola proteins keep changing.

10:45.615 --> 10:48.996
The virus seems to be recombining
at an extremely high frequency.

10:49.080 --> 10:51.000
What are you saying? It's evolving?

10:51.083 --> 10:54.130
Exactly, and we're fighting
to keep up with it.

10:54.172 --> 10:56.350
So, you get it? We can't
neutralize something until

10:56.795 --> 10:59.140
- we know what we're going after.
- And how soon will that be?

10:59.446 --> 11:01.811
Depends on how many labs
we have working on it.

11:01.894 --> 11:03.974
Look, I'll see what I can do.
In the meantime, this thing,

11:04.258 --> 11:07.863
the research data, nothing
leaves this lab until I say so.

11:24.268 --> 11:25.518
How's she doing?

11:26.089 --> 11:29.070
She hasn't eaten.
She's on a protryptaline drip.

11:29.487 --> 11:30.388
Oh, I'll take that.

11:37.686 --> 11:38.780
Remember me?

11:42.759 --> 11:46.599
You know, you really ought
to eat something.

11:57.869 --> 11:59.706
Daisy, what happened to you,

11:59.790 --> 12:02.127
to Miranda...

12:06.260 --> 12:08.724
It wasn't your fault.

12:09.766 --> 12:12.521
We're going to find out who did this.
I swear to you.

12:15.693 --> 12:17.864
I mean, you're...

12:17.947 --> 12:21.453
You're going to walk out of here
and everything's going to be okay.

12:23.080 --> 12:24.408
So, will you--

13:15.968 --> 13:19.224
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:21.499 --> 13:22.812
So, you're okay?

13:26.863 --> 13:28.824
Uh, you got the car keys?

13:50.515 --> 13:52.593
You have to be on the list.

13:55.157 --> 13:57.500
Hey, you were here the other day.

13:57.584 --> 13:59.963
Uh, yes sir. Dr. Sandstrom
was running some tests on me.

14:00.047 --> 14:01.925
I just wanted to know
if he had any results yet.

14:02.009 --> 14:04.847
Sure, it's okay.
You want to come in the lab?

14:04.889 --> 14:07.393
- Is Dr. Sandstrom there?
- No, he's on his way.

14:07.477 --> 14:10.691
Come on in. I've been running
those tests on you.

14:10.774 --> 14:12.348
So, I was right, wasn't I?

14:12.861 --> 14:16.994
I'm a scientist, Mick. I have to believe
in science fact, not science fiction.

14:17.077 --> 14:18.997
You don't believe me?

14:19.081 --> 14:20.835
- '90 right? You were born in 1990?
- Yeah.

14:20.876 --> 14:23.297
Well, back then cloning
an embryonic cell

14:23.380 --> 14:26.010
by nuclear transfer was just
not... just not possible.

14:26.093 --> 14:29.207
Briggs & King cloned a frog in 1952

14:29.208 --> 14:32.062
and Dr. Bromhall cloned
a rabbit in 1975.

14:32.146 --> 14:35.861
Well yes, but... Are they
teaching that in school already?

14:35.944 --> 14:37.990
No, my dad talks
about that stuff all the time.

14:38.073 --> 14:40.035
Have you ever heard
of a Dr. Shelby Sloane?

14:40.119 --> 14:42.122
That's your father?

14:42.164 --> 14:44.877
He wrote the bible on
reductionism in genetics.

14:44.919 --> 14:46.922
Yeah.

14:47.006 --> 14:50.846
Yeah, well then he probably told you
that Briggs & Kings' frog didn't survive

14:50.888 --> 14:52.891
and the rabbits ended up as mutants.

14:52.975 --> 14:55.813
It was a step closer, but...
No, no, you can't be a clone.

14:55.855 --> 14:58.360
I am! I have to be!

14:58.443 --> 15:00.488
Yeah, okay, sure.

15:00.572 --> 15:03.369
Look, I know what you're thinking.
I'm not a twin.

15:03.452 --> 15:05.790
Okay. Okay...

15:05.873 --> 15:09.338
Right. So, what I'd like
to do is take some blood.

15:09.421 --> 15:12.468
Run a couple more tests.
Are you good with that?

15:16.350 --> 15:18.312
What's wrong with this test?

15:18.354 --> 15:21.109
You know how to interpret
a DNA sequence?

15:22.745 --> 15:25.025
Sure you do,
your dad taught you, didn't he?

15:25.408 --> 15:28.330
Well, this one's not right.
I need to do it over.

15:28.413 --> 15:29.874
Fine.

15:29.916 --> 15:31.878
Have a seat, I'll be right back.

15:31.920 --> 15:34.221
And don't touch anything. Just...

15:35.350 --> 15:36.034
Okay.

15:41.520 --> 15:45.861
I don't see any difference.
They must be twins.

15:45.945 --> 15:50.411
Not according to their birth certificates.
They were born 2 years apart.

15:50.453 --> 15:53.208
Ooh, then that's
what I call a long labour.

15:53.250 --> 15:55.211
I'm up to 27 VNTR loci.

15:55.253 --> 15:57.382
Isn't that a little overkill, Bob?

15:57.424 --> 16:00.846
Sure, but I know I'll find
some differences in the DNA eventually.

16:00.888 --> 16:03.518
Hey, you guys hear about this guy?

16:03.601 --> 16:06.398
He says he's using
Jesus Christ's DNA to resurrect him.

16:06.482 --> 16:10.322
"Indeed it is. The scriptures
prophesied the return of Christ.

16:10.364 --> 16:12.451
"They never prophesied how or when."

16:12.492 --> 16:13.386
Turn it off, Mayko.

16:14.076 --> 16:16.018
Ever hear David weigh in on this guy?

16:16.367 --> 16:17.921
Oh, let me guess.
He doesn't believe him.

16:18.509 --> 16:19.463
No shit.

16:20.196 --> 16:22.009
David thinks I rushed the sequencing.

16:22.051 --> 16:25.766
Made a mistake.
Sequenced the same DNA twice.

16:25.850 --> 16:27.811
I don't make mistakes.

16:27.853 --> 16:30.316
- Then somebody made a clone.
- 15 years ago?

16:30.399 --> 16:35.617
They didn't even have iPods.
I must have screwed up somewhere.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.094
- Hello.
- Hey, what's going on?

16:45.498 --> 16:46.740
- You're out.
- I'm out.

16:47.023 --> 16:48.571
Are you covered in poxes or what?

16:48.855 --> 16:50.701
- Funny. Is Carlos there?
- Yeah, hold on.

16:51.911 --> 16:52.784
Hola, David.

16:53.026 --> 16:55.079
You get anything back
from Paris about the virus?

16:55.703 --> 16:57.256
Uh, it didn't go to Paris.

16:57.386 --> 16:59.516
- Say again.
- Security.

17:00.244 --> 17:02.248
Jesus Christ. Is Hira on it?

17:02.290 --> 17:05.378
- She's been locked out, David.
- What do you mean, locked out?

17:05.421 --> 17:07.715
Caroline seems to think there could be
an issue with her clearance.

17:07.800 --> 17:10.262
- She does?
- Oh, for fuck sakes,

17:10.349 --> 17:11.730
where's Caroline?
Get her on the phone!

17:11.887 --> 17:14.175
- I haven't seen her all morning.
- Find her!

17:14.290 --> 17:15.741
It's good to have you back, David.

17:15.875 --> 17:17.977
You'll get over that in a day or two.

17:18.359 --> 17:20.446
Hira, you're employed by a lab
that handles everything

17:20.489 --> 17:22.451
from toxic mould to P-strain 872,
where--

17:22.535 --> 17:25.415
Don't patronize me, Caroline.
I know what it is.

17:30.215 --> 17:32.135
Do you recognize these men?

17:32.219 --> 17:34.055
Some of them.

17:34.139 --> 17:36.184
This one?

17:36.267 --> 17:38.688
My brother, Maura.

17:38.772 --> 17:41.402
This was taken at his 21st
birthday party.

17:41.485 --> 17:43.447
Where did you get that?

17:43.530 --> 17:46.077
- Do you recognize these men?
- No.

17:46.118 --> 17:48.790
You don't recognize your brother?

17:48.873 --> 17:51.342
I haven't seen my brother
for over 2 years.

17:52.171 --> 17:56.220
Well, this is what he looks like today.

17:56.262 --> 17:58.223
What does this have
to do with me?

17:58.307 --> 17:59.358
Did you know your brother's
a member of a terrorist

17:59.741 --> 18:02.172
organization known
as Jaish-e-Mohammed?

18:02.589 --> 18:05.153
The Army of Mohammed.

18:05.236 --> 18:08.367
Are you a member
of The Army of Mohammed?

18:08.408 --> 18:10.913
I can't believe you would ask me that.

18:10.955 --> 18:12.607
Do you recognize these emails?

18:13.501 --> 18:15.900
Where are you going with this, Caroline?

18:16.882 --> 18:18.510
I had them translated.

18:18.552 --> 18:21.014
"My beloved sister, Hira.
What you told me

18:21.056 --> 18:23.602
about Brucellosis wasn't enough.
I need more."

18:23.644 --> 18:26.148
Why were you writing
to your brother about it?

18:26.232 --> 18:28.569
My brother is a good man.
He's just your--

18:28.611 --> 18:30.657
He's part of an organization
that's responsible

18:30.740 --> 18:32.660
for suicide attacks against
the Indian parliament!

18:32.744 --> 18:35.582
That's a lie. I don't believe my brother
has anything to do with that.

18:35.666 --> 18:39.273
What other information did you share
with him? With Jaish-e-Mohammed?

18:39.551 --> 18:42.094
Why are you acting as if I did?

18:42.177 --> 18:44.515
Hira, this is
why you're down here.

18:44.556 --> 18:48.495
This is why you're locked
out of the lab.

18:51.611 --> 18:53.447
Excuse me, are you Dr. Sandstrom?

18:53.531 --> 18:55.576
I might be.

18:55.660 --> 18:58.415
Peter Madden, IPN News. I just wanted
to get you comments on what's going on--

18:58.498 --> 19:00.961
No, no. Look, I don't do PR,
okay. Now for the moment,

19:01.044 --> 19:03.883
the epidemic has been contained,
World Health is going to contact--

19:03.966 --> 19:05.845
- No.
- You guys if there's any updates on--

19:05.928 --> 19:09.977
We just wanted to get your reaction
on this cloning of Christ business.

19:11.620 --> 19:13.442
You got to be kidding me, right?

19:13.525 --> 19:15.779
You're aware of the work the
Reverend Steven Walsh is doing?

19:15.946 --> 19:17.376
Believe me, I have got
better things to do.

19:17.629 --> 19:19.526
You know the guy's a con artist, right?

19:19.911 --> 19:22.124
Then you don't think it's
possible to clone something

19:22.207 --> 19:23.960
from a smear of ancient blood.

19:24.044 --> 19:25.505
Come on!

19:25.547 --> 19:27.550
Dr. Sandstrom,
theoretically speaking,

19:27.634 --> 19:29.470
isn't there some scientific basis--

19:29.512 --> 19:31.766
Could somebody come down please
and let me into my fucking lab!

19:31.850 --> 19:33.476
...to what Dr. Walsh is doing
with his team of researchers.

19:33.728 --> 19:36.367
Reverend Walsh theoretically
could be telling the truth.

19:36.721 --> 19:38.060
Okay, sure! Theoretically...

19:38.557 --> 19:40.719
if you by some believable way...

19:41.102 --> 19:43.412
could secure
viable genetic material

19:43.454 --> 19:45.761
from some ancient source...

19:46.626 --> 19:50.613
It's possible, theoretically
that you could... You know,

19:51.343 --> 19:56.336
extract the DNA.
But that doesn't mean that you...

19:58.580 --> 20:01.653
Don't you have a parade or something
you should be covering?

20:03.072 --> 20:05.034
What was that all about?

20:05.076 --> 20:07.455
Ignorance. Who changed
the codes to the front door?

20:07.538 --> 20:09.667
Who do you think?

20:13.215 --> 20:17.012
No, mum.
Dad actually wants me to stay.

20:20.353 --> 20:22.357
No, I'm not lying to you.

20:22.440 --> 20:24.819
Yeah, and what about school?

20:25.446 --> 20:27.320
Yes, I know I have to go.

20:30.298 --> 20:31.307
Yeah... I got it...

20:31.730 --> 20:33.920
I don't know, okay,
but I'll figure it out...

20:34.670 --> 20:35.422
No!

20:35.505 --> 20:37.467
Yeah, all right, fine.

20:37.509 --> 20:39.638
I'll get him to call you. Bye.

20:42.977 --> 20:44.814
Hey, what's up?

20:44.897 --> 20:47.402
I've got proof.
I mean, I saw it.

20:53.162 --> 20:55.082
Yeah, you saw what?

20:55.165 --> 20:57.162
Is your dad here?

20:57.670 --> 21:03.013
Lilith, my DNA is exactly
like my brother's. I saw it.

21:06.519 --> 21:07.980
Okay.

21:08.064 --> 21:10.234
It was identical.

21:12.446 --> 21:15.368
So, what? What?
That makes you a clone?

21:15.410 --> 21:19.125
Yes! Your dad's got to believe me now.
I mean, he'll want a study.

21:21.588 --> 21:23.174
Yeah, I guess.

21:23.257 --> 21:25.138
No, he's a scientist
and I'm a messed up experiment

21:25.399 --> 21:26.632
and he's going to want to fix me.

21:27.057 --> 21:28.873
He'll have to, won't he?

21:31.355 --> 21:33.442
I don't know. Like...

21:37.700 --> 21:40.442
I don't know when he's going
to be home or whatever,

21:43.293 --> 21:45.673
but you can like, stay.

21:45.756 --> 21:48.082
I should probably get going.
My dad's going to start--

21:49.054 --> 21:52.894
Your dad... What... Do you do
everything this guy wants?

21:53.668 --> 21:56.500
I'm not sure I do anything he wants.

22:00.658 --> 22:02.745
Do you want something to drink?

22:02.828 --> 22:04.540
Yeah, sure.

22:04.623 --> 22:05.807
We've got champagne.

22:06.792 --> 22:08.363
I don't drink champagne.

22:10.039 --> 22:12.178
Yeah, yeah, I know you're
right. It's too gay.

22:12.262 --> 22:15.267
Uh, there's tequila and margarita mix.

22:15.309 --> 22:18.815
Oh, no. I don't drink
alcohol... in general.

22:18.899 --> 22:21.028
Oh.

22:24.492 --> 22:29.201
It's 3:00. I mean, it's a pretty
good time to start, right?

22:32.746 --> 22:33.548
Okay, sure.

22:38.476 --> 22:40.103
Are...

22:42.984 --> 22:44.737
Are you okay?

22:49.787 --> 22:52.793
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

22:52.835 --> 22:55.339
Cool, okay. Sure.

23:03.051 --> 23:05.441
What do you know
about this Walsh guy?

23:05.482 --> 23:07.903
Just what I hear on the news,

23:07.987 --> 23:10.366
and we know they never lie.

23:10.408 --> 23:13.037
- The whole thing's a scam.
- Oh, I don't know.

23:13.121 --> 23:14.707
He did prove he got the nail
from the hill

23:14.791 --> 23:16.919
- where Jesus was crucified.
- He proved that, did he?

23:16.961 --> 23:19.883
Do you know how many people
got nailed on that hill?

23:19.967 --> 23:22.012
Okay, what about the DNA match
from the blood on the nail

23:22.069 --> 23:24.642
to the blood in that chapel in Belgium?

23:24.725 --> 23:25.992
What are you talking about?

23:26.247 --> 23:28.899
It was on the news last night.
Some place in Belgium,

23:28.941 --> 23:31.103
they got a vial of Christ's blood,
like in a shrine.

23:31.186 --> 23:32.320
Oh sure, yeah, I believe that.

23:32.580 --> 23:34.044
- Okay, just say they do.
- No.

23:34.241 --> 23:37.657
You know as well as I do that you can
reconstruct the degraded DNA

23:37.906 --> 23:40.033
off the nail through
the genome gathering--

23:40.348 --> 23:43.133
You know what? I'm sorry
I brought it up.

23:43.217 --> 23:45.137
Even if Walsh is
David Blaine with a crucifix,

23:45.220 --> 23:47.850
that doesn't mean he didn't hook up
with somebody really smart.

23:47.933 --> 23:50.897
Maybe there's a genetic researcher
out there who's way ahead of the curve.

23:50.939 --> 23:52.226
More ahead of the curve than I am?

23:52.392 --> 23:54.284
I know. It boggles the mind.

23:55.280 --> 23:56.866
- Hi.
- In a minute, Bob.

23:56.908 --> 23:58.260
I do need to talk
to you about this DNA.

23:58.278 --> 23:59.338
Bob..!

24:07.093 --> 24:08.929
Where's Hira?

24:09.013 --> 24:10.714
At the moment, she's a security risk.

24:10.715 --> 24:12.060
I don't think she should be here.

24:12.143 --> 24:15.107
Oh, you don't think she should be here.
Okay, let me get this straight.

24:15.191 --> 24:17.103
We have got some asshole out
there using babies

24:17.186 --> 24:20.074
as Ebola factories,
and I'm losing my chief virologist.

24:20.158 --> 24:23.577
I'll try to get her cleared
as soon as possible, okay?

24:24.232 --> 24:26.989
David, do you know there are 3 vials
of recombinant salmonella

24:27.127 --> 24:29.027
unaccounted for in this lab?

24:29.216 --> 24:31.303
Well, did you check the freezer?

24:31.344 --> 24:34.108
I think I saw them in there next
to Jimmy Hoffa's body.

24:34.229 --> 24:35.519
What's your point, Caroline?

24:35.602 --> 24:38.064
Things get misplaced
around here all the time.

24:38.147 --> 24:39.542
Not anymore.

24:40.500 --> 24:42.615
Do you know Hira has
a brother who's a member

24:42.698 --> 24:44.660
of a terrorist cell in Pakistan?

24:46.254 --> 24:47.245
Coincidence?

24:48.208 --> 24:50.508
You think she took them?

24:52.191 --> 24:55.603
You think Hira
gave salmonella to a terrorist group?

24:56.097 --> 24:57.822
David, I've never
questioned your judgement

24:58.140 --> 24:59.931
when it comes to
the science in this lab.

25:00.038 --> 25:02.915
Don't question mine when it
comes to security.

25:04.075 --> 25:05.525
- I want her back.
- So do I.

25:05.698 --> 25:08.209
When I'm satisfied she works for us,

25:08.210 --> 25:10.790
not for whoever else is out there.

25:16.955 --> 25:17.563
Bullshit.

25:18.679 --> 25:20.975
Is now a good time?

25:21.059 --> 25:22.619
Oh Jesus, Bob. What?

25:22.979 --> 25:25.608
I don't think I made a mistake on the
DNA samples from Mick and his brother.

25:25.692 --> 25:28.238
- Well, then you did the test too fast.
- You told me to.

25:28.322 --> 25:29.608
We all make mistakes.

25:29.708 --> 25:31.933
Then I made the same mistake again.
I got a new sample.

25:33.497 --> 25:37.296
See, so far it's identical to the first
sample. I didn't make a mistake, David.

25:37.379 --> 25:39.592
Don't lose it on me. Do you have
any idea what you're saying?

25:39.633 --> 25:40.719
- I'm just looking at the data.
- I don't care about the data.

25:41.042 --> 25:44.267
There's no way somebody cloned
a human being 15 years ago.

25:44.309 --> 25:46.187
You know his father's Shelby Sloane?

25:46.270 --> 25:48.900
Yeah, I talked to him.
He thinks his kid's nuts. Carlos!

25:48.942 --> 25:51.071
- Have you seen this?
- I have.

25:51.154 --> 25:53.993
Any way Sloan could have pulled a clone
out of his hat 15 years ago?

25:54.034 --> 25:55.996
- No.
- What have we got here?

25:56.038 --> 25:58.000
I'd say we're missing some
part of the equation.

25:58.083 --> 26:00.462
I'll keep looking for
something different in the DNA.

26:00.546 --> 26:03.468
If you want to be really sure,
we'd have to run the full sequence.

26:03.551 --> 26:05.597
The complete genome?
On both of them?

26:05.638 --> 26:08.644
There's no way. It would take 6 months
and easily cost 2 million per kid.

26:08.727 --> 26:09.654
I know! I know! I know!

26:10.269 --> 26:11.513
Goddamn it!

26:17.910 --> 26:20.248
Okay, we're asking the wrong
questions here.

26:20.331 --> 26:22.627
Is he a clone or not, fuck that,
there's no way.

26:22.669 --> 26:24.329
So, what's the thing?
The thing is...

26:25.701 --> 26:26.665
The thing is...

26:28.930 --> 26:31.101
Why would Sloan need a copy?

26:31.142 --> 26:35.066
Why would Sloan need as close
of a copy as he could get?

26:35.150 --> 26:36.443
It makes... Brother...

26:36.963 --> 26:37.766
Why would he?

26:40.826 --> 26:42.329
What did he die of?

26:42.371 --> 26:43.873
- Mick's brother, uh...
- Cal.

26:44.259 --> 26:45.438
Yeah, Cal. What killed him?

26:45.839 --> 26:47.881
- Osteosarcoma.
- Bone marrow cancer.

26:47.922 --> 26:50.510
That's good, that's good.
It depends how you look at it.

26:50.594 --> 26:53.182
No, this is it.
This is it. Okay...

26:53.224 --> 26:55.645
we're going to look at those
samples and we're going run

26:55.728 --> 26:58.024
PCR tests on them. I want you
to focus on gene CF-268,

26:58.107 --> 27:01.346
- It's on chromosome 9.
- CF-268.

27:01.963 --> 27:05.055
Exactly, we're going to look for
that gene that causes bone cancer.

27:05.582 --> 27:07.332
We're going to look
for it in both samples,

27:07.416 --> 27:10.453
and if we find that
it's mutated in Cal but not in Mick,

27:10.785 --> 27:11.958
we got what we're looking for.

27:12.299 --> 27:14.911
- We'll look.
- All right.

27:15.681 --> 27:16.941
Where are you going?

27:17.357 --> 27:21.015
I'm going to go find out why
we're one PhD short around here.

27:31.417 --> 27:33.766
David, you're okay.

27:34.410 --> 27:36.003
It was just the Ebola virus.

27:37.307 --> 27:38.459
Can we talk?

27:43.981 --> 27:45.442
You look good.

27:45.526 --> 27:46.903
Ah, thank you.

27:48.990 --> 27:50.827
What's going on?

27:50.869 --> 27:53.999
I figured Caroline would
have filled you in by now.

27:54.083 --> 27:56.462
Yeah, she told me one of
your brothers belonged

27:56.504 --> 27:59.259
to an extremist group in
Pakistan. That's about it.

28:01.638 --> 28:04.309
I'm on your side here.
You've got to know that.

28:04.393 --> 28:06.989
She found some emails
I wrote to my brother.

28:06.990 --> 28:09.527
He wanted to know how
to make Brucellosis.

28:09.569 --> 28:11.698
That's a dirty little bug.
You didn't tell him, did you?

28:11.781 --> 28:14.327
- Of course not.
- I'm just asking.

28:14.411 --> 28:17.015
I told him how dangerous a
bacterium like Brucellosis was,

28:17.016 --> 28:18.188
how easily it could spread.

28:18.418 --> 28:19.682
And you mentioned all this to Caroline?

28:20.220 --> 28:21.563
She wanted something more from me.

28:22.174 --> 28:23.825
Was there more?

28:24.283 --> 28:24.950
Yeah...

28:26.975 --> 28:29.605
I was approached
by the Pakistani military.

28:29.688 --> 28:32.151
They offered me my
own lab in Karachi.

28:32.234 --> 28:34.518
Well, why wouldn't they?
You're a brilliant scientist.

28:34.519 --> 28:35.615
What's the issue here?

28:35.657 --> 28:38.412
At the time I was working
for the U.S. Defence Department.

28:38.454 --> 28:40.082
The Pakistanis wanted me to work

28:40.124 --> 28:43.254
on the same biologal warfare agents
I was working on there.

28:43.296 --> 28:45.766
Tularemia, Botulinum toxin.

28:46.011 --> 28:47.720
They wanted me
to deliver them.

28:47.804 --> 28:51.060
Steal the bio-agents I was working on.

28:51.102 --> 28:52.980
But you didn't, right?

28:53.022 --> 28:55.054
I thought about it, David.

28:56.110 --> 28:59.451
India had a biological
weapons program,

28:59.452 --> 29:01.412
Pakistan wanted one.

29:01.495 --> 29:04.960
Best defence: Mutually
assured destruction.

29:05.901 --> 29:07.422
Jesus.

29:10.671 --> 29:11.695
All right.

29:12.676 --> 29:14.516
Did you give them anything,

29:14.903 --> 29:16.438
and I mean anything at all?

29:16.772 --> 29:18.275
No.

29:18.359 --> 29:20.487
And you told all this to Caroline?

29:21.572 --> 29:22.334
Yes.

29:22.950 --> 29:24.662
She didn't believe you.

29:24.745 --> 29:28.126
She sent someone
to interrogate my parents.

29:31.340 --> 29:35.381
Okay, so I'll pick you up
tomorrow morning at 8:00.

29:35.942 --> 29:38.116
No, David I can't. I'm locked out!

29:38.854 --> 29:42.277
I know you can handle this, all
right? I know you're smart

29:42.318 --> 29:46.242
and I know you're strong
but I am a selfish little brat who wants

29:46.325 --> 29:49.498
his best virologist
in his lab tomorrow morning.

29:49.581 --> 29:51.919
- And Caroline?
- Ah Caroline-Smaroline.

29:51.961 --> 29:53.928
We'll deal with Caroline...

29:55.133 --> 29:58.389
Somehow... Together. Okay?

30:00.341 --> 30:01.436
Okay.

30:49.188 --> 30:51.025
"It's identical to the first sample.

30:51.066 --> 30:53.446
"When I'm satisfied she works for us.

30:53.487 --> 30:55.825
"Maybe there's a genetic researcher
out there who's way ahead of the curve?

30:56.660 --> 30:58.622
"They were born 2 years apart.

31:01.711 --> 31:03.158
"Sure, theoretically!

31:03.193 --> 31:07.849
"If you by some...
believable way could secure

31:08.214 --> 31:10.671
"viable genetic material
from some ancient source...

31:10.852 --> 31:14.380
"It's possible theoretically
that you could--

31:14.483 --> 31:18.617
"Dr. Sandstrom, a renowned microbiologist
here in Toronto lending credence--"

31:18.652 --> 31:19.845
Aw, Jesus Christ!

31:20.313 --> 31:23.833
"...extraordinary possibility that
the Christ child could indeed be cloned."

31:25.010 --> 31:25.771
What?

31:25.921 --> 31:28.049
- Where are you?
- I don't really know.

31:28.133 --> 31:30.665
You were right, David.
Mick doesn't have it.

31:31.222 --> 31:33.851
Somebody fixed gene CF-268.

31:33.935 --> 31:35.813
That son of a bitch.

31:35.855 --> 31:37.650
Listen, Mayko wants to speak to you.

31:37.692 --> 31:39.153
Put her on.

31:39.236 --> 31:41.323
You been listening to the radio?

31:41.407 --> 31:42.384
Unfortunately.

31:42.426 --> 31:44.502
That sound byte just made you
Walsh's best friend.

31:44.798 --> 31:46.215
You know what, Mayko?
I want you to do me a favour.

31:46.552 --> 31:48.061
Get in touch with Walsh's people,

31:48.155 --> 31:50.088
tell them I'll give them a fair hearing.

31:50.132 --> 31:50.893
Meaning what?

31:50.927 --> 31:52.421
Meaning I'll test their
goddamn icon and I will

31:52.744 --> 31:54.878
announce the results
no matter what they are.

31:55.035 --> 31:56.330
Aren't you in deep enough?

31:56.368 --> 31:58.369
If I'm wrong,
may lightening strike me dead.

32:01.317 --> 32:03.154
Was it like vitamins and everything?

32:03.237 --> 32:04.949
Not really.

32:12.546 --> 32:14.758
What are you thinking about?

32:14.842 --> 32:16.595
Nothing.

32:16.678 --> 32:18.682
My dad I guess.

32:18.723 --> 32:22.981
Ha! No offence,
but he is like, a real dick.

32:25.321 --> 32:26.680
Sometimes...

32:27.437 --> 32:29.508
I wonder if he can't talk to me

32:29.543 --> 32:31.580
because he doesn't think I'm real.

32:35.211 --> 32:37.048
You're real, Mick.

32:38.808 --> 32:41.556
No, I mean real like his son.

32:43.643 --> 32:46.523
Cal was always, you know like,
the sick one,

32:46.565 --> 32:49.297
the one that needed to be saved.
And I was always...

32:51.657 --> 32:53.619
I don't know, like some kind
of lab experiment.

32:53.654 --> 32:55.381
You're not a lab experiment!

32:55.423 --> 32:58.420
I was just made
to save my brother and now he's gone.

32:58.503 --> 33:01.592
Then what difference does it make
if I'm dead or alive?

33:06.184 --> 33:08.229
Yeah, that's really fucked up.

33:09.312 --> 33:10.447
I know.

33:12.528 --> 33:14.097
So am I.

33:16.716 --> 33:18.056
It's been some time.

33:18.826 --> 33:20.073
Ten years, Tampa.

33:21.515 --> 33:23.757
The Hyatt Convention Hall.

33:23.840 --> 33:26.167
You stood up and publicly challenged

33:26.542 --> 33:28.687
my direction in the
Human Genome Project.

33:29.600 --> 33:33.524
Yeah, well. Old school, new school,
I wasn't the only one.

33:33.608 --> 33:35.820
No, just the loudest.

33:36.806 --> 33:38.867
To what do I owe the honour
of this intrusion?

33:38.951 --> 33:40.328
Well, Dr. Sloane,

33:41.273 --> 33:44.627
I just want to know,
how did you manage to manipulate

33:44.711 --> 33:47.758
the genetic code of a human embryo?

33:51.174 --> 33:52.767
Okay, you want to know what I think?

33:52.809 --> 33:57.692
- Do I have a choice?
- I think Mick was in-vitro.

33:58.254 --> 34:00.865
Thousands of babies were
conceived that way.

34:00.948 --> 34:03.077
No, no. Not 15 years ago.

34:03.161 --> 34:06.583
You have no idea what I was
capable of 15 years ago.

34:06.667 --> 34:08.545
I'm starting to believe that

34:08.629 --> 34:12.344
you were able to get
a fertilized human egg,

34:12.385 --> 34:15.850
get into it and
manipulate the DNA.

34:15.891 --> 34:18.581
Before the human genome
was mapped?

34:19.051 --> 34:21.190
Oh, I know. That's what's so
goddamn brilliant about it.

34:21.491 --> 34:23.654
I mean, somehow you were able to find

34:23.655 --> 34:26.242
the mutant bone marrow
cancer gene in Mick,

34:26.331 --> 34:28.581
and replace it with a normal one.

34:32.338 --> 34:34.382
You did, didn't you?

34:34.425 --> 34:38.264
Like I said, you have no idea
what I was capable of back then.

34:38.349 --> 34:42.231
It's brilliant, Sloane.
It's goddamn brilliant!

34:44.109 --> 34:47.114
It's just unfortunate that
you had to jettison

34:47.197 --> 34:50.310
a lot of excess baggage to get there.

34:55.512 --> 34:57.591
I'm talking about your son.

34:58.927 --> 35:01.348
My son?

35:01.390 --> 35:03.435
It was all about my son.

35:03.477 --> 35:05.164
All of it.

35:06.608 --> 35:09.780
I wasn't going to wait for God
to give me a miracle.

35:10.700 --> 35:13.662
I knew how to make my own.

35:13.678 --> 35:16.160
It was goddamn brilliant.

35:18.504 --> 35:22.010
I was seeing things no one had
ever seen before.

35:22.094 --> 35:24.348
A whole new frontier of science.

35:24.431 --> 35:26.852
Wait a minute, you're talking about Cal?

35:26.936 --> 35:30.442
You're goddamn right,
I'm talking about Cal, he was dying!

35:30.484 --> 35:34.366
While the rest of you were imagining
the impossible, I was doing it!

35:34.407 --> 35:35.891
- You were doing it all right.
- Fucking right!

35:36.411 --> 35:39.166
You think any great advances
would ever have been made

35:39.208 --> 35:42.255
if it had been left to a bunch
of second-guessing cowards?

35:42.338 --> 35:45.427
Well, you certainly weren't that!
I guess sacrifices had to be made, right?

35:45.511 --> 35:48.975
- You know nothing about sacrifice.
- Well, Mick does.

35:49.017 --> 35:52.273
And he's going around saying he's a
goddamn clone, but it's worse than that.

35:52.314 --> 35:55.236
He's Cal's twin. And you stick him
in a freezer for 2 years so what?

35:55.278 --> 35:57.443
So, if something goes wrong with Cal,
you can thaw him out, mess with his DNA

35:57.761 --> 35:59.927
and use him for spare fucking parts?

35:59.993 --> 36:02.301
I mean Jesus! That's why he's dying now,
you son of a bitch!

36:02.524 --> 36:03.686
I know he's dying!

36:07.831 --> 36:09.520
You think I don't know that?

36:24.581 --> 36:28.003
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't come over here to...

36:32.136 --> 36:34.223
I want to help.

36:36.143 --> 36:40.002
It's so easy for you to
judge me, isn't it?

36:41.713 --> 36:45.611
Tell me, what would
you have done, Dr. Sandstrom?

36:48.582 --> 36:50.316
Would you have just...

36:51.504 --> 36:55.428
Sat back and watched your child die?

36:56.683 --> 36:58.379
I've done everything...

37:00.880 --> 37:03.124
Everything scientifically possible.

37:06.645 --> 37:08.260
You can't help us.

37:09.219 --> 37:10.786
No one can.

37:12.891 --> 37:14.467
It's too late.

37:21.892 --> 37:25.481
When I was like, 3...

37:27.568 --> 37:31.868
My parents, they got divorced

37:31.910 --> 37:35.875
and my mom, she took me out West...

37:38.338 --> 37:42.721
and I never saw my dad.
Or like hardly ever.

37:46.535 --> 37:51.225
And, whenever I did, he was way too busy

37:53.340 --> 37:55.464
to... to even notice me.

37:56.579 --> 37:58.875
Yeah.

37:58.916 --> 38:01.838
You're there,
but you're not there.

38:05.595 --> 38:07.557
Yeah, exactly.

38:07.640 --> 38:11.390
It was like that when...

38:13.484 --> 38:16.531
when my brother died.

38:18.072 --> 38:20.330
I knew he was there,

38:20.371 --> 38:24.045
I knew he was with me in my room.

38:29.638 --> 38:32.727
I knew he was there
and I knew that he had died.

38:42.035 --> 38:44.331
You know the weird thing though?

38:47.462 --> 38:51.385
If it weren't for him,
I wouldn't be alive.

38:55.423 --> 38:56.695
I mean, I wouldn't be dying.

38:59.400 --> 39:03.198
It's not like I'm afraid
to die or anything, you know.

39:05.035 --> 39:07.706
I just want to live my life.

39:13.800 --> 39:15.637
I know.

39:58.965 --> 40:01.594
Oh, did I fall asleep?

40:01.636 --> 40:03.556
Come on, let me help you to your room.

40:03.598 --> 40:05.560
No, I'm fine. I'm fine here.

40:09.095 --> 40:10.425
Are you all right?

40:12.018 --> 40:13.117
Sure.

40:14.670 --> 40:16.957
Then why you have to fight?

40:18.206 --> 40:20.950
I've spent my whole life fighting.

40:21.688 --> 40:24.391
To go to school.
To learn the things I've learned.

40:24.469 --> 40:27.558
To make a mark in my field.

40:27.599 --> 40:30.187
I won't let them take that away.

40:31.707 --> 40:33.777
It won't happen, dad.

40:39.537 --> 40:41.416
"So, how great is this town?

40:41.499 --> 40:44.004
"In the last year, we got SARS,
a black-out and...

40:44.087 --> 40:47.427
"I've got a little jock itch.

40:47.552 --> 40:50.432
"And what about that last Ebola thing,
was that freaky or what?

40:50.515 --> 40:53.855
"You know, it's kind of a relief
this Walsh guy - you heard about him?

40:53.896 --> 40:58.029
"This guy, the Reverend Stephen Walsh
is cloning Jesus Christ.

40:58.071 --> 41:01.953
"Yeah, I think I'm signing up for
my own personal one of those.

41:01.994 --> 41:05.155
"Yeah, cheap wine out of water.
Heals me when I get sick.

41:05.650 --> 41:08.172
"Christ: The perfect gift for
the guy who's got everything!"

41:37.511 --> 41:38.402
Hey.

41:40.986 --> 41:42.399
Did you have a nice night?

41:43.992 --> 41:44.789
Yeah.

41:47.736 --> 41:49.226
Are you expecting somebody?

41:50.116 --> 41:50.872
No.

41:57.970 --> 42:00.391
Fifteen years of disappointments.

42:00.432 --> 42:03.062
If there's a miracle in there,
maybe you can find it.

42:03.104 --> 42:03.800
Come in.

42:03.801 --> 42:06.388
No, I can't. Mick isn't at home. So...

42:06.909 --> 42:08.898
He's here, Dr. Sloane.

42:09.713 --> 42:10.693
I see.

42:14.833 --> 42:17.129
Look, Mick's scared.

42:17.171 --> 42:19.633
He's all alone,
he has no one to talk to

42:19.717 --> 42:22.096
and he sure as hell can't talk to you.

42:25.769 --> 42:28.608
I'm sorry.

42:29.797 --> 42:31.530
- It's okay, dad.
- No, it's not okay.

42:31.571 --> 42:33.742
It's never been okay.

42:35.045 --> 42:37.318
You're entitled to the truth, Mick.

42:38.527 --> 42:40.028
What I did,

42:40.565 --> 42:42.027
I did out of love

42:42.670 --> 42:44.321
for your brother,

42:45.558 --> 42:46.678
love for you,

42:46.713 --> 42:51.273
for the healthy son I hoped you'd be.

42:51.357 --> 42:54.070
Sorry I didn't live up
to your expectations.

42:54.154 --> 42:56.491
Oh... Mick, if I...

42:56.533 --> 42:59.997
If I had half your character,
your strength!

43:00.039 --> 43:03.128
I'm the one who didn't live up
to his promise!

43:03.170 --> 43:08.179
As a man, as a scientist, as a father!

43:10.391 --> 43:15.692
The truth is that I created
one son to save another.

43:17.404 --> 43:20.033
I never thought I would fail.

43:22.997 --> 43:25.710
I never thought
about the consequences.

43:28.716 --> 43:30.803
Let's just go, dad.

43:39.193 --> 43:42.407
Mick... Uh...

43:43.993 --> 43:45.797
Call me or...

43:51.047 --> 43:52.759
Goodbye, Dr. Sandstrom.

43:54.637 --> 43:56.974
Dad, just...

43:58.096 --> 44:00.397
Tell me you can help him.

44:03.361 --> 44:05.865
I don't know.

44:07.602 --> 44:08.495
Ah!... Yeah, you can!

44:08.579 --> 44:11.292
I mean, of course you can.
You're Dr...

44:11.334 --> 44:12.920
Lilith,

44:12.961 --> 44:16.094
the odds are he is beyond
anybody's help.

44:17.428 --> 44:20.099
I'm just telling you the truth.

44:24.649 --> 44:26.778
I'm sorry.

44:41.805 --> 44:44.393
Not only has Dr. David Sandstrom
acknowledged

44:44.435 --> 44:47.106
the possibility of
our miraculous cloning of Jesus,

44:47.189 --> 44:50.070
but he said he would prove it
beyond the shadow of a doubt.

44:50.153 --> 44:52.574
Hey, did you check out
what's going on out there?

44:52.658 --> 44:56.498
Some kind of demonstration.
David's not going to like it.

44:58.794 --> 45:01.215
When are we going to see
some evidence of your claims?

45:01.256 --> 45:03.552
They're more than just claims,
young lady.

45:03.594 --> 45:07.267
We are entering
a great new age of enlightenment

45:07.351 --> 45:10.724
and the return of Christ is
only the beginning.

45:13.821 --> 45:15.499
Are you ready for this?

45:16.962 --> 45:18.883
I don't know.

45:19.431 --> 45:21.911
Could you just lie and say:
"Yeah, I'm great David,

45:22.346 --> 45:23.445
there's nothing to worry about.

45:23.746 --> 45:27.786
I just know you are going to kick
Caroline's ass, if she gets in my face."

45:27.887 --> 45:29.766
No. I can't say that.

45:29.849 --> 45:31.853
Could you at least think it?

45:32.362 --> 45:33.776
What?

45:34.149 --> 45:35.814
David, I did some preliminary test
on the scraping

45:36.057 --> 45:36.998
we got from Reverend Walsh.

45:37.542 --> 45:38.636
Yeah, on the nail. Okay.

45:39.503 --> 45:41.025
Yeah, it's a really degraded mess.

45:41.310 --> 45:42.177
Of course it is, Bob.

45:42.443 --> 45:43.576
What do you
want me to do?

45:43.821 --> 45:46.221
Sequence the genes we use to

45:46.237 --> 45:48.330
to test for somebody's
racial background.

45:48.417 --> 45:50.323
- Let's really pick this thing apart.
- Sure. Oh, and one more--

45:51.603 --> 45:52.250
...thing.

45:59.193 --> 46:02.449
Dr. Sandstrom will no doubt
affirm what we already know--

46:02.491 --> 46:03.821
- Shit.
- the nail is authentic.

46:04.090 --> 46:05.257
David, let's just go in the back.

46:05.783 --> 46:09.163
Oh no, no, no. We are not going
in the back door of our own lab.

46:10.648 --> 46:11.598
The blood.

46:11.812 --> 46:14.643
The DNA matches known samples
of Christ's blood.

46:14.872 --> 46:16.542
That's a lie Walsh and you know it!

46:16.821 --> 46:19.301
- I don't think he heard you.
- He doesn't want to hear me.

46:19.516 --> 46:21.261
Furthermore, the blood traces
taken from the nail,

46:21.307 --> 46:22.983
from which we cloned the Christ child

46:23.283 --> 46:25.982
have been genetically
broken down by 4 independent labs.

46:26.596 --> 46:30.209
Now what labs?
Where's your documentation? Is that it?

46:30.501 --> 46:32.392
They show the blood to be that of a man.

46:32.972 --> 46:35.830
A man with the genetic characteristics
of a Semite.

46:36.082 --> 46:38.760
Come one, a lab told you that?
How much are you paying them Walsh?

46:38.998 --> 46:41.819
No!

47:19.752 --> 47:21.529
Next time on ReGenesis...

47:23.000 --> 47:25.713
- Hira's dead, David!
- Yes, she's dead. Got it!

47:26.716 --> 47:27.800
I've got to get out of here.

47:29.219 --> 47:31.891
Yeah, when Burillsky went
through the boards?

47:31.932 --> 47:34.437
- They're the biggest.
- Oh, man, you're not...

47:34.768 --> 47:38.059
We have a situation developing in the US
related to a prion type disease.

47:38.424 --> 47:39.631
Mad cow.

47:39.734 --> 47:41.032
- Bullshit!
- I'm sorry?

47:41.116 --> 47:44.363
It takes at least 7 years for
a prion protein to fuck up the brain,

47:44.817 --> 47:46.613
and then at least another
year after that before you die.

47:47.224 --> 47:49.434
Sarah McKinley, Tampa,
Florida, 5 years old.

47:50.173 --> 47:53.221
And how are they getting it?
How are they getting it?

47:53.304 --> 47:55.892
Your accreditation means a
great deal to all of us involved.

47:55.976 --> 47:58.546
- Really, what's a great deal?
- Say...

48:00.052 --> 48:01.367
$100,000.
