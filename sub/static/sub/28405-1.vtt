WEBVTT

00:07.108 --> 00:12.111
We met on the computer
in 1966.

00:12.113 --> 00:14.046
It was called T.A.C.T.--

00:14.048 --> 00:17.282
Technical Automated
Compatibility Testing.

00:17.284 --> 00:21.120
They made us answer
all these questions.

00:21.122 --> 00:22.554
"Do you like the beach?"

00:22.556 --> 00:24.056
"Do you speak
another language?"

00:24.058 --> 00:26.425
I remember
they even asked me

00:26.427 --> 00:29.028
to rank
a woman's hairstyle.

00:29.030 --> 00:33.132
I believe I said
I preferred a bob.

00:33.134 --> 00:34.333
I had a bob.

00:34.335 --> 00:36.702
[chuckles] Anyway,

00:36.704 --> 00:40.372
this giant IBM machine--

00:40.374 --> 00:43.142
about the size
of this room--

00:43.144 --> 00:44.643
matches us together.

00:44.645 --> 00:45.811
It was...

00:45.813 --> 00:47.312
Love at first fan theory.

00:47.314 --> 00:49.114
[chuckles]
We both frequented

00:49.116 --> 00:51.316
the same<i> X-Files</i> chat room
in the '90's.

00:51.318 --> 00:54.319
I was just so nervous
to meet her,

00:54.321 --> 00:58.323
but we emailed for
about two years, until...

00:58.325 --> 00:59.758
He started favoriting
some of my tweets

00:59.760 --> 01:01.360
about being drunk
at brunch.

01:01.362 --> 01:03.362
And I love
getting drunk at brunch.

01:03.364 --> 01:05.497
So then I started favoriting
some of his tweets.

01:05.499 --> 01:07.499
So then we started
re-tweeting each other,

01:07.501 --> 01:10.769
and then we started
DM'ing each other,
and then...

01:10.771 --> 01:13.472
I was on this Facebook page
for incoming students

01:13.474 --> 01:15.774
and I saw a message
that Melissa had posted

01:15.776 --> 01:17.276
about starting
a knitting club.

01:17.278 --> 01:19.178
[laughs]
James!

01:19.180 --> 01:21.246
-Of course you asked.
-I just wanted to see

01:21.248 --> 01:22.714
if anyone was interested.

01:22.716 --> 01:25.384
But of course,
when I held our first meeting,

01:25.386 --> 01:27.853
-only one person came.
-[James laughs]

01:27.855 --> 01:29.721
I just thought
she was cute.

01:29.723 --> 01:31.723
I just didn't realize
I'd have to pretend

01:31.725 --> 01:34.159
to crochet a hat
for two months straight.

01:34.161 --> 01:35.661
[both laugh]

01:35.663 --> 01:37.429
[female interviewer]
And how long ago was that?

01:37.431 --> 01:38.530
Eight years.

01:38.532 --> 01:39.798
-Eight years?
-Yes.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.400
[interviewer]
And how are things going?

01:41.402 --> 01:43.102
Things are going
really good.

01:43.104 --> 01:45.437
I'm about to get my PhD
in microbiology,

01:45.439 --> 01:47.873
-and Mel is an amazing--
-I freelance mostly.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.842
But lately, I've been
driving for Swyft.

01:49.844 --> 01:52.511
[man]
Is she really talking to me?
Or is she talking to her father?

01:52.513 --> 01:55.848
And as hard as you try,
you will never be able
to live up to him.

01:55.850 --> 01:58.383
Yes! You totally get it.

01:58.385 --> 01:59.718
[scoffs] Right.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.887
-So you begin to resent her.
-Right.

02:01.889 --> 02:05.357
-Which starts
this whole pattern of--
-No, make a right.

02:05.359 --> 02:06.592
-You're gonna miss the turn.
-Oh, shit.

02:06.594 --> 02:08.327
I mean, the flexible
hours are great.

02:08.329 --> 02:10.195
It gives me time
to work on my art,

02:10.197 --> 02:12.631
and rehearse
with my improv group,
The Diva Cups.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.833
One word suggestion,
then I need bing-bang boom.

02:14.835 --> 02:17.503
-[Mel vocalizing]
-And a body!

02:17.505 --> 02:20.139
[Spanish accent]
Today, we'll be having
something<i> especial</i> I want to--

02:20.141 --> 02:21.840
Ahh, meatballs sub.

02:21.842 --> 02:24.409
Now, they're really good.
Really, really good.

02:24.411 --> 02:26.345
-Thank you, babe.
-[both chuckle]

02:26.347 --> 02:27.813
Oh! And we just got

02:27.815 --> 02:29.882
-an apartment together.
-Yes. Yes, we did.

02:29.884 --> 02:33.218
Do you think we should get
a rug for the living room?

02:33.220 --> 02:35.587
Mmm, I'm not sure.

02:35.589 --> 02:37.923
-You decide.
-[scoffs]

02:37.925 --> 02:39.525
Did you get
a lamp yet?

02:39.527 --> 02:41.460
Not yet.
Having trouble deciding.

02:41.462 --> 02:43.228
-Mmm.
-James, did you read this,

02:43.230 --> 02:45.164
about this guy
who's apparently meeting

02:45.166 --> 02:47.900
women online
and kidnapping them?

02:47.902 --> 02:50.235
Oh, I read somewhere
that it was a hoax.

02:50.237 --> 02:52.237
Mitchell's doin' it, you know.

02:52.239 --> 02:53.772
Kidnapping women?

02:53.774 --> 02:57.176
[chuckles]
No. Meeting guys online.

02:57.178 --> 02:58.477
Really? So soon?

02:58.479 --> 03:01.613
I know. I still can't
believe they broke up.

03:03.184 --> 03:04.650
They seemed so happy.

03:04.652 --> 03:06.885
<i> I actually feel</i>
<i> really sad and lonely.</i>

03:06.887 --> 03:09.655
<i> And I actually feel like</i>
<i> there's a rock in my shoe.</i>

03:09.657 --> 03:13.292
Trust me, they're gonna be
back together in like no time.

03:13.294 --> 03:14.526
She told me she's getting dozens

03:14.528 --> 03:16.428
of messages a day
from these guys.

03:16.430 --> 03:18.463
She's going out a lot...

03:19.266 --> 03:23.202
So, what do you want
to do today?

03:25.306 --> 03:27.206
I have an idea.

03:27.208 --> 03:28.307
Huh. Oh!

03:28.309 --> 03:29.541
[grunts, laughs]

03:29.543 --> 03:30.976
-Hey...
-[James chuckles]

03:30.978 --> 03:33.312
Let's have a party
this weekend.

03:33.314 --> 03:34.880
What? No.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.515
-Ah, come on!
-No.

03:36.517 --> 03:38.517
We'll have
a lot of friends over,

03:38.519 --> 03:41.286
we need to show off
our cool new pad...

03:41.288 --> 03:43.455
[scoffs]
I thought you said

03:43.457 --> 03:45.791
parties give you anxiety.

03:45.793 --> 03:47.392
What?

03:48.696 --> 03:50.329
No, they don't.

03:50.331 --> 03:52.264
[Mel] Oh, my God,
I'm having a panic attack.

03:52.266 --> 03:54.266
-[James] No, you're not.
-[Mel] They're too
many people here.

03:54.268 --> 03:56.401
Why didn't you remind me that
I hate having dinner parties?

03:56.403 --> 03:58.503
[James]
Babe, I did, several times.

03:58.505 --> 04:00.739
[Mel] Well, you need
to be more convincing.

04:00.741 --> 04:03.242
Also, not a lot of
people showed up.

04:03.244 --> 04:05.444
Forty people
on Facebook RSVP'd, "Yes"

04:05.446 --> 04:07.846
and there's
only like 20 people here.

04:07.848 --> 04:10.315
-[jazz playing over speakers]
-Mmm. I thought you said

04:10.317 --> 04:12.584
there were
too many people here.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.287
That's not the point.

04:15.289 --> 04:16.355
It's the principle.

04:16.357 --> 04:17.990
That's how it always is.

04:17.992 --> 04:19.758
Yes means maybe,

04:19.760 --> 04:22.394
maybe means no,
no means...

04:22.396 --> 04:23.929
Yeah, well,
I don't mean to be harsh

04:23.931 --> 04:25.897
you know, when there's
EDM involved.

04:25.899 --> 04:28.000
-You're drunk.
-No, I'm not.

04:29.303 --> 04:32.004
And did you meet
Rachel's new boyfriend?

04:32.006 --> 04:34.940
-[James groans]
-The guy she met on Bumble.

04:34.942 --> 04:37.276
[James] Of course
she'd bring somebody new.

04:37.278 --> 04:38.710
What if Ben shows up?

04:38.712 --> 04:41.913
[Mel] I think
that's what she's hoping for.

04:41.915 --> 04:44.449
-[Mel and James] She sees us.
-[Rachel] Yeah... Guys, guys!

04:44.451 --> 04:46.385
-[Mel] Hi!
-[James] Hey!

04:46.387 --> 04:48.053
I mean, I love this.

04:48.055 --> 04:49.821
I mean, I love
the apartment.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.390
-I love you guys in it.
-[man] Yeah...

04:51.392 --> 04:53.292
Thanks,
we're really happy here.

04:53.294 --> 04:54.493
Yeah, it's perfect.

04:55.429 --> 04:57.629
So, Rachel,
how's the new job?

04:57.631 --> 05:00.399
-Oh, hello, drunky--
-What!

05:00.401 --> 05:01.733
[laughter]

05:01.735 --> 05:03.302
You know, I mean, it's--

05:03.304 --> 05:04.903
Ah, well, I'm about to quit.

05:04.905 --> 05:07.472
-[Mel] What happened this time?
-So Gary tells me

05:07.474 --> 05:09.474
to get plastic forks
for the break room.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.777
And I asked him if that
is an appropriate task

05:11.779 --> 05:13.478
for the head of marketing,

05:13.480 --> 05:15.447
and he looks as
me and he says,

05:15.449 --> 05:17.316
[deep voice]
"Well, we need
to market ourselves

05:17.318 --> 05:18.784
as a company
that has forks."

05:18.786 --> 05:20.886
-Can you believe that?
-[laughs]

05:20.888 --> 05:23.889
Why are you laughing?
You've heard this story
a dozen times.

05:23.891 --> 05:26.425
Oh, yeah. No, it's
just the way you say that.

05:26.427 --> 05:28.360
It's hilarious. [laughs]

05:28.362 --> 05:30.028
Uh, hey guys, I'm Todd,
by the way.

05:30.030 --> 05:31.963
-[Rachel] Oh, yeah, sorry.
-[James] Hi, what's goin' on?

05:31.965 --> 05:33.799
-[Rachel] James, this is Todd.
-[Todd] Nice to meet you guys.

05:33.801 --> 05:35.867
Thank you so much for having me.
This place is awesome.

05:35.869 --> 05:38.437
It's like, it's like
really great, I love it.

05:38.439 --> 05:40.572
How much
do you guys pay actually,
if you don't mind me asking?

05:40.574 --> 05:42.441
Actually, no, I'm sorry.
Do not answer that, I'm so--

05:42.443 --> 05:43.875
I do not why...
[stammers]

05:43.877 --> 05:45.043
I don't know why
I asked that.

05:45.045 --> 05:46.912
That's a bizarre
thing to ask.

05:46.914 --> 05:48.947
Very intrusive,
I hate when people
ask stuff like that.

05:48.949 --> 05:51.550
I'm just-- I'm--
I'm planning
on moving, so...

05:51.552 --> 05:53.018
-[Mel] Oh...
-I'm lookin' for a place,

05:53.020 --> 05:54.686
and I really like
this neighborhood.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.088
It's kind of like the...

05:56.090 --> 05:57.789
exact thing that
I'm looking for, so...

05:57.791 --> 05:59.958
Just looking for like a--
If you don't mind,

05:59.960 --> 06:01.460
like a ballpark figure
for a frame of reference.

06:01.462 --> 06:02.828
-Todd...
-Oh, yeah. Sorry, sorry.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.529
No, no, no, no.
You're right,
you're right.

06:04.531 --> 06:05.764
So I asked
the same thing twice.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.366
-Twice in a row. Bizarre.
-Yeah...

06:07.368 --> 06:08.700
I'm sorry.
It's none of my business.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.936
[laughs] So, uh,
sorry about that.

06:11.939 --> 06:13.538
So...

06:13.540 --> 06:15.407
-Ah, so, Todd...
-Yo.

06:15.409 --> 06:16.508
Ah, what do you do?

06:16.510 --> 06:17.843
Ah, I'm in finance actually,

06:17.845 --> 06:20.078
but my real passion
is food-- Tapas.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.881
-Wow.
-I love tapas.
I actually have a blog

06:22.883 --> 06:25.784
all about tapas called,
"Top Tapas With Todd Tom."

06:25.786 --> 06:27.686
-I don't know
if you guys heard of it.
-It's very creative.

06:27.688 --> 06:29.154
-It's pretty pop--
Oh, thank you.
-[Rachel] Loves the tapas.

06:29.156 --> 06:30.589
Wait. Uh, okay.

06:30.591 --> 06:32.824
Your name is Todd...

06:32.826 --> 06:33.859
-[Rachel] Yeah.
-Tom?

06:33.861 --> 06:34.926
-Todd Tom.
-Tom.

06:34.928 --> 06:36.161
-Todd Tom.
-Todd Tom.

06:36.163 --> 06:38.096
-Yeah, that's a--
-Psych. Rachel.

06:38.098 --> 06:39.965
-Just talk to you for a second?
-Uh, babe?

06:39.967 --> 06:41.967
-You just talk. You know...
-[James] Okay.

06:41.969 --> 06:43.502
-Don't say anything weird.
-[Todd] Anything what?

06:43.504 --> 06:45.504
Weird.

06:45.506 --> 06:47.005
Yeah, what's up?

06:47.775 --> 06:50.008
His name is Dustin.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.943
He's really nice.
He's really funny.

06:51.945 --> 06:53.945
He's the founding member
of Pizza Hat,

06:53.947 --> 06:56.748
which is like
the biggest improv
group in L.A.,

06:56.750 --> 06:58.650
so I'm surely surprised
that he's here.

06:58.652 --> 07:01.787
-[Rachel] Hmm.
-[Mel] Anyway, he's single...

07:01.789 --> 07:03.889
[Rachel scoffs]
Oh, no, I could never date

07:03.891 --> 07:05.624
anyone who does improv.

07:05.626 --> 07:07.125
-No offense.
-[Mel] Oh.

07:07.127 --> 07:08.960
[Rachel]
Anyways, I'm seeing Todd.

07:08.962 --> 07:11.997
-Don't you like Todd?
-Yeah. No.

07:11.999 --> 07:13.865
Todd, Todd seems great.

07:13.867 --> 07:16.768
It just-- I didn't think
you were that into him.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.638
[Rachel] Really?
No, I'm totally into Todd.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.606
He's so...

07:22.042 --> 07:23.108
nice.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.910
[scoffs]
I just, I can't date

07:24.912 --> 07:27.179
and other introverted
pessimist with intimacy issues.

07:27.181 --> 07:29.214
-[Mel chuckles]
-Speaking of which...

07:29.216 --> 07:32.584
um, do you know,
is Ben coming?

07:32.586 --> 07:34.886
Yeah, he stopped texting.

07:35.656 --> 07:37.856
But he did Snapchat

07:37.858 --> 07:39.791
a photo of a dead pigeon
about an hour ago,

07:39.793 --> 07:40.959
so we know he's alive.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.093
Yeah.

07:42.095 --> 07:43.862
I thought
the break up was mutual.

07:43.864 --> 07:45.230
It was,

07:45.232 --> 07:46.865
but now he's...

07:46.867 --> 07:48.567
[sighs]
He and I just...

07:48.569 --> 07:51.570
I really want
us to be friends.

07:51.572 --> 07:54.906
Oh! And you will be.

07:54.908 --> 07:57.542
But you guys dated
for four years,

07:57.544 --> 07:59.244
you can't just erase that.

07:59.246 --> 08:01.580
I think Ben
just needs some...

08:01.582 --> 08:03.548
some Ben time.

08:03.550 --> 08:04.749
Yeah.

08:04.751 --> 08:06.618
Nope. Never mind.

08:06.620 --> 08:07.786
There he is.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.588
[Rachel] Oh...

08:13.894 --> 08:15.627
Hey.

08:15.629 --> 08:16.895
-Hi. [chuckles]
-[Ben] Hey.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.830
-Hi, I'm, uh...
-Mere question.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.699
-Yeah?
-Do you have any pot?

08:20.701 --> 08:22.033
Ah, no, sorry, I don't.

08:22.035 --> 08:24.135
Oh, your eyes
are really red.

08:24.137 --> 08:25.737
-Oh! Yeah, no, no, no.
-Smoke pot--

08:25.739 --> 08:27.639
Sorry. I've--
I was just crying.

08:27.641 --> 08:29.274
Oh. Okay.

08:29.276 --> 08:31.710
Can I grab it?
Thank you so much.

08:32.613 --> 08:35.180
[people chattering]

08:39.586 --> 08:41.887
Ooh, Ben!

08:41.889 --> 08:43.622
You look terrible.

08:43.624 --> 08:45.957
Thank you, Lawrence.
I feel like shit.

08:45.959 --> 08:48.159
This place is great.
How long you had
the lease for?

08:48.161 --> 08:51.162
Ah. Mmm. Excuse me.
I have it for a year.

08:51.164 --> 08:54.866
I'm gonna finish my PhD in May,
so I could potentially get

08:54.868 --> 08:56.968
a teaching job anywhere, so...

08:56.970 --> 08:58.703
[Ben]
Will Mel go with you?

08:58.705 --> 09:01.773
Uh-- I don't--
I don't-- I don't know.

09:01.775 --> 09:05.043
We've-- We've have not
had that conversation yet.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.646
Well, you know,
take it from me,
people, like all of 'em,

09:07.648 --> 09:09.648
garbage, so if you found
the kind of garbage

09:09.650 --> 09:11.716
you can stand to be around
in a hot apartment all day,

09:11.718 --> 09:13.885
you know, don't throw it out,
because that's what I did.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.787
-[Ben laughs]
-Well, you're single.

09:15.789 --> 09:17.722
Have fun, there's plenty
of women out there

09:17.724 --> 09:19.658
-for you to disappoint.
-[all chuckle]

09:19.660 --> 09:21.960
-Thank you.
-I don't really
like the term single.

09:21.962 --> 09:23.728
-Thank you so much.
-[Lawrence and James] Oh.

09:23.730 --> 09:26.064
Kinda prefer the term
involuntarily alone.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.568
You should, uh--
You should get on Bumble.

09:29.570 --> 09:31.636
-That's how I met my girlfriend.
-[James] No-- Um...

09:31.638 --> 09:33.672
-I'm sorry, who are you?
-Oh, sorry. Todd.

09:33.674 --> 09:36.641
Nice to meet you, man.
I'm Rachel Strauss' boyfriend.

09:36.643 --> 09:38.577
I don't know where she went.
She's around here somewhere.

09:38.579 --> 09:39.978
-I'm Ben.
-Nice to meet you, Ben.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.813
Well, I should
probably get goin'.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.048
-[James] Ben...
-I'm sure I'll be seein' you

09:43.050 --> 09:44.349
in my next panic dream, Todd,

09:44.351 --> 09:45.984
enjoying having sex
with the only woman

09:45.986 --> 09:47.953
-I have ever loved.
-Ahh. Uh--

09:47.955 --> 09:50.255
-Take it easy. Uh, I--
-Ben--

10:05.606 --> 10:07.072
[sets beer down on table]

10:13.647 --> 10:15.180
[door opens]

10:16.116 --> 10:17.382
[Mel]
That's not done yet.

10:17.384 --> 10:18.683
You made this?

10:18.685 --> 10:20.652
Mm-hmm.

10:20.654 --> 10:22.220
And I talked to Rachel.

10:22.222 --> 10:24.356
She really wants
to be your friend...

10:24.358 --> 10:26.725
I don't want her
to want to be my friend.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.693
What, do you want her
to break down into tears

10:28.695 --> 10:30.295
every time
someone mentions your name?

10:30.297 --> 10:32.030
Yeah, I feel like
that's the least she could do.

10:32.032 --> 10:34.699
That, and like some, like,
dry heaving or something.

10:34.701 --> 10:37.102
-[chuckles]
-Your room's kinda dark.

10:37.104 --> 10:39.671
I know!
It needs a lamp.

10:39.673 --> 10:41.406
Guess who found old cocaine
in his back pocket

10:41.408 --> 10:43.775
that he completely
forgot about?

10:43.777 --> 10:45.877
[Lawrence chuckles]

10:47.714 --> 10:49.681
Uh, maybe another time.

10:49.683 --> 10:50.849
All right.

10:50.851 --> 10:53.351
[Ben]
Quick. All right.

10:53.887 --> 10:56.321
Drama-aaa.

10:57.024 --> 10:58.690
[nose snorting cocaine]

10:58.692 --> 11:00.258
[Rachel] Okay, now,
you think that is bad?

11:00.260 --> 11:02.260
I went on this Tinder date
with this guy

11:02.262 --> 11:05.897
who literally brought
his Indian leftovers

11:05.899 --> 11:07.732
to the bar and ate them.

11:07.734 --> 11:10.135
-[Lawrence laughs]
-That was horrifying!

11:10.137 --> 11:12.303
And he wouldn't even
give me a Samosa.

11:12.305 --> 11:14.873
[Lawrence laughs]
A Samosa.

11:14.875 --> 11:17.375
Okay, why are
you laughing, stalker?

11:17.377 --> 11:20.178
-Do not call me that.
-What are you talking about?

11:20.180 --> 11:22.714
-Who are you stalking?
-No. No one.

11:22.716 --> 11:23.882
I'm not stalking anyone.

11:23.884 --> 11:27.118
-[Mel] Lawrence!
-Stop! No!

11:27.120 --> 11:29.421
Here.
His name is Marco.

11:29.423 --> 11:32.190
-[Mel] Hold on...
-And he is my future husband.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.925
Oh, really?

11:33.927 --> 11:37.228
-Like. Like. Like. Like--
-Stop!

11:37.230 --> 11:39.130
Girl, don't do that!
Oh, my goodness.

11:39.132 --> 11:41.733
You know, I have
actually been getting

11:41.735 --> 11:44.302
a lot of threesome requests.

11:44.304 --> 11:46.938
Actually,
there was this one couple
who was pretty cute.

11:46.940 --> 11:49.808
They had pictures
of them rock climbing and stuff.

11:49.810 --> 11:52.177
-[Lawrence] Would you?
-No!

11:52.179 --> 11:55.780
I'm like 65
in threesome years.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.450
I mean, honestly...

11:59.986 --> 12:02.087
I just want what Mel has.

12:02.089 --> 12:04.189
[coughing]
What do I have?

12:04.191 --> 12:06.024
[Lawrence]
Yeah, what does she have?

12:06.026 --> 12:08.026
[metallic clicking]

12:11.031 --> 12:13.164
[James]
There she is, there she is.

12:13.166 --> 12:16.468
-You makin'-- You makin' toast?
-[James] Hi. Yes, I am.

12:16.470 --> 12:18.336
-Oh, okay.
-[James] Ooh!

12:18.338 --> 12:21.506
Ah, I wasn't gonna
do this tonight,
but I figured

12:21.508 --> 12:24.142
since I'm-- I'm in
a really good mood tonight,

12:24.144 --> 12:27.912
and all you beautiful people
are here, so...

12:27.914 --> 12:28.980
Whoo.

12:28.982 --> 12:30.749
-Wow.
-[both laugh]

12:30.751 --> 12:33.151
-So, Mel...
-Yeah?

12:34.187 --> 12:36.821
-You're my best friend.
-Oh.

12:36.823 --> 12:38.423
And I love you.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.225
Will you marry me?

12:45.799 --> 12:47.465
Mel.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.501
Mel...

12:49.503 --> 12:51.536
-What?
-Will you marry me?

12:51.538 --> 12:53.304
-Yes.
-Ah!

12:53.306 --> 12:56.107
-Yeah! Why not?
-[crowd cheering]

[Allison]<i> It's this place</i>
<i> called Fish Giza.</i>

13:40.887 --> 13:42.887
Mmm, it's so good.

You have to go.

13:44.858 --> 13:48.126
[Ben]<i> I know that place.</i>
<i> I live right near it.</i>

13:48.128 --> 13:50.562
Oh, my gosh,
I'm so jealous.

13:50.564 --> 13:53.198
I would kill
to live near there.

Oh, come on!

14:29.936 --> 14:32.503
-[man] Been drivin' long?
-Yeah, like six months.

14:32.505 --> 14:34.138
-Oh, wow.
-Yeah.

-[phone buttons clicking]
-Yeah, it's good.

14:36.109 --> 14:37.942
Makes good money, I hear.

14:37.944 --> 14:39.110
-Yeah, it can.
-Yeah?

14:39.112 --> 14:40.411
-It depends.
-Yeah.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.113
Um, the most important thing

14:42.115 --> 14:44.616
is just it allows
my schedule to be flexible.

14:44.618 --> 14:46.351
-Right.
-Yeah.

14:46.353 --> 14:48.887
-What do you do?
-I'm a director.

14:48.889 --> 14:50.922
What do you direct?
That's cool.

14:50.924 --> 14:52.490
Reality television, mostly.

14:52.492 --> 14:54.292
Oh, would I--
Would I know any of it?

14:54.294 --> 14:57.061
Um, I pretty much
do the shows

14:57.063 --> 14:59.197
where fat white
men find trash

14:59.199 --> 15:00.531
and sell it
to other fat white men

15:00.533 --> 15:01.599
for small amounts of money.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.101
Right up my alley. [laughs]

15:03.103 --> 15:05.069
Do you, um--
Do you like it?

15:05.071 --> 15:07.472
-Is it fun?
-Sorry. This is
actually really important.

15:07.474 --> 15:10.141
Oh! Totally, no problem.

15:10.143 --> 15:12.343
-Sorry.
-No, it's all right.

I don't know if my life

15:14.414 --> 15:16.381
is really, really lost.

15:16.383 --> 15:18.116
What do you like to do?

15:18.118 --> 15:21.986
I like to watch
<i> Law and Order</i> reruns,

15:21.988 --> 15:24.122
uh, particularly
with Mariska Hargitay.

15:24.124 --> 15:26.925
-I think she's incredible.
-Okay. Definitely.

15:26.927 --> 15:28.927
Well, have you thought
about being a cop?

15:28.929 --> 15:31.930
-[scoffs] No.
-[turn signal clicking]

15:36.336 --> 15:38.236
Um, why are we stopping?

15:38.238 --> 15:39.938
You picked
Swyft Pools,

15:39.940 --> 15:41.572
so there's
another passenger.

15:41.574 --> 15:44.075
Oh, but I didn't know that,
so can we just leave him?

15:47.080 --> 15:49.547
-Hey.
-Hey.

15:49.549 --> 15:52.016
Hi. So, your destination
didn't come through.

15:52.018 --> 15:53.451
Where are you headed?

15:58.258 --> 16:00.458
[Allison laughs]
I'm from Wisconsin.

16:00.460 --> 16:03.294
You know, I don't think
I've ever met anybody
from Wisconsin before.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.563
Well, yeah.
It's like this small,

16:05.565 --> 16:08.333
Lutheran town
outside of Madison.

16:08.335 --> 16:10.568
You're Lutheran?
I don't think I've ever met

16:10.570 --> 16:13.037
-one of those before.
-Aw, I must be

16:13.039 --> 16:15.340
-really exotic to you.
-[jazz playing over speakers]

16:15.342 --> 16:17.575
Yeah, yeah.
God, you are.

16:17.577 --> 16:22.313
I feel like I'm on a date
with a unicorn or something.

16:22.315 --> 16:24.382
[stammers]
Where in L.A. do you live?

16:24.384 --> 16:26.551
I'm sorry,
did you already tell me that?
I-I have this thing

16:26.553 --> 16:28.987
where if I read something
on my phone, I like
instantly forget it.

16:28.989 --> 16:31.990
No, no,
I don't-- I don't think
we went over that.

16:31.992 --> 16:33.391
-I live in Silverlake.
-Oh, nice.

16:33.393 --> 16:36.127
Yeah, my ex, Rachel,
lives in Silverlake.

16:36.129 --> 16:38.329
[laughs]
Which I'm sure
is very interesting to you.

16:38.331 --> 16:39.998
God, I'm sorry.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.033
I'm just realizing
how bad I am at this.

16:42.035 --> 16:43.368
[chuckles]

16:43.370 --> 16:44.435
This is very uncomfortable,
isn't it?

16:44.437 --> 16:46.170
No.

16:48.008 --> 16:49.173
It's not--

16:49.175 --> 16:50.508
It's not.

16:50.510 --> 16:53.077
Not uncomfortable.

16:53.079 --> 16:55.213
Okay, new game plan.
Why don't you get another drink,

16:55.215 --> 16:57.215
and I'm just going
to walk outside and
quietly step into traffic.

16:57.217 --> 16:59.517
[laughs]
It's okay.
It's fine, really.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.753
Uh, I remember

17:01.755 --> 17:05.456
what it's like dating again
after a break-up.

17:07.060 --> 17:09.193
Uh, how long has it been?

17:09.195 --> 17:11.696
She broke up with
me about six months ago.

17:12.732 --> 17:14.198
He said I dumped him?

17:14.200 --> 17:16.401
Are you kidding me?
It was mutual.

17:16.403 --> 17:19.337
[Rachel]
<i> We were in a bad place</i>
<i> for almost a year.</i>

17:19.339 --> 17:21.773
<i> Ben was unhappy,</i>
<i> I was unhappy.</i>

17:21.775 --> 17:24.108
<i> I felt like everything</i>
<i> I said annoyed him,</i>

17:24.110 --> 17:27.078
and I resented him
for making me feel that way.

17:27.080 --> 17:29.313
Things were great between us.
I mean, they weren't like

17:29.315 --> 17:31.416
<i> they were at the beginning,</i>
<i> but, you know, they never are.</i>

17:31.418 --> 17:34.652
<i> We had a good connection.</i>
<i> Things were fine. Really.</i>

17:34.654 --> 17:37.755
And then one night,
totally organically,

17:37.757 --> 17:39.757
we just broke down,

17:39.759 --> 17:42.593
and started talking
to each other.

17:42.595 --> 17:44.729
Then one night,
she totally blindsides me

17:44.731 --> 17:46.764
and says, "We need
to talk about our relationship."

17:46.766 --> 17:48.833
<i> Then she just starts listing</i>
<i> off all the terrible things</i>

17:48.835 --> 17:50.501
<i> I've done to her</i>
<i> over the past year.</i>

17:50.503 --> 17:53.237
I mean, she's tiny,
but she's got the memory

17:53.239 --> 17:55.173
of a fuckin' elephant.
It was...

17:55.175 --> 17:57.608
Great.
We were completely honest

17:57.610 --> 17:59.644
about the way
that we were feeling

17:59.646 --> 18:01.179
<i> and what we wanted.</i>

18:01.181 --> 18:03.815
<i> It was just like old times.</i>

18:03.817 --> 18:05.817
<i> We laughed about our past</i>

18:05.819 --> 18:07.418
<i> and we promised each other</i>

18:07.420 --> 18:09.087
<i> that we would</i>
<i> love each other forever</i>

18:09.089 --> 18:11.255
<i> and we'd be</i>
<i> in each other's lives.</i>

18:12.158 --> 18:13.491
And it was over.

18:14.260 --> 18:15.726
<i> Well, that was until</i>

18:15.728 --> 18:17.462
<i> five days later</i>
<i> when he showed up</i>

18:17.464 --> 18:19.330
<i> at my place completely drunk.</i>

18:19.332 --> 18:22.100
<i> Called me a bitch,</i>
<i> vomited in my vase</i>

18:22.102 --> 18:23.768
<i> and then unfriended</i>
<i> me on Facebook.</i>

18:23.770 --> 18:25.736
Why would I want to be
her Facebook friend?

18:25.738 --> 18:27.538
Why would I want
to see photos of her

18:27.540 --> 18:29.774
and be constantly reminded--
You know, there was a time

18:29.776 --> 18:32.543
when we used to break-up
and just never see
each other again.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.378
Just wander off
to the next town,

18:34.380 --> 18:36.214
meet a girl,
get Syphilis and die.

18:36.216 --> 18:38.449
The Facebook thing hurt more
than I thought it would.

18:38.451 --> 18:41.319
We had 257 mutual friends,

18:41.321 --> 18:43.354
dozens of photos
tagged together,

18:43.356 --> 18:47.158
and hundreds of inside jokes
posted on each other's wall.

18:48.161 --> 18:50.428
And now it was all...

18:51.197 --> 18:53.297
And I broke up with him.

18:56.169 --> 18:57.502
Ben. Ben.

18:57.504 --> 18:59.637
I'm gonna have sex
with you, okay?

18:59.639 --> 19:02.206
But I just feel like
I need to do this

19:02.208 --> 19:04.242
because it's been a long time
since I've been with anyone

19:04.244 --> 19:07.211
who isn't Peter, but I want
to be totally honest with you.

19:07.213 --> 19:10.281
I don't want to see you again
after tonight, okay?

19:10.283 --> 19:13.484
You're clearly not
in a good place emotionally.

19:13.486 --> 19:14.919
You're sensibly unemployed,

19:14.921 --> 19:16.621
and like a majority
of your jokes

19:16.623 --> 19:18.389
make me really uncomfortable.

19:18.391 --> 19:20.158
So, yeah.

19:20.160 --> 19:23.227
I just want to be
up front with you about that.

19:23.229 --> 19:25.396
So we're going to have sex?

19:26.900 --> 19:28.633
-[unzips zipper]
-Oh, God.

19:28.635 --> 19:30.301
[Mel]<i> Isn't it weird that</i>
<i> just a few hours before</i>

19:30.303 --> 19:31.903
-she was a total stranger?
-[Ben] She's cute.

19:31.905 --> 19:33.604
I think that's kind of
what I like about it.

19:33.606 --> 19:35.606
-What?
-My life is full of people

19:35.608 --> 19:38.543
I grew up with
or I went to school with,
or I work with,

19:38.545 --> 19:40.645
and it's kind of
a narrow cross-section,
if you think about it.

19:40.647 --> 19:42.213
-It's like educated artists--
-[Lawrence] Ben--

19:42.215 --> 19:43.848
-I am not an artist.
-What I mean is,

19:43.850 --> 19:46.484
I rarely meet people who are
truly different than me.

19:46.486 --> 19:48.819
With this, you know,
I can kind of expand beyond

19:48.821 --> 19:50.321
my immediate bubble.

19:50.323 --> 19:51.689
What about Rachel?
She's Chinese.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.491
-She's outside your bubble.
-Adopted.

19:53.493 --> 19:55.493
She's more Jewish than I am.
And the private school

19:55.495 --> 19:57.495
she went to had an
even smaller class than mine.

19:57.497 --> 19:59.430
[James] So, when are you
going to see this girl again?

19:59.432 --> 20:01.432
[Ben]
I don't know. She texted me.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.601
But, uh, I got a couple more
dates coming up next week,

20:03.603 --> 20:05.670
so I'm gonna kinda
see how things go.

20:05.672 --> 20:07.772
Yeah, good call.
Play the field,

20:07.774 --> 20:10.208
make an informed choice--
I like that.

20:10.210 --> 20:11.909
[Lawrence]
Take it from an expert,

20:11.911 --> 20:13.544
people aren't that different.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.913
I mean, sure,
some people are Lutheran,

20:15.915 --> 20:17.381
some people are fat,

20:17.383 --> 20:19.684
some people grew up
in an igloo.

20:19.686 --> 20:22.286
But it's like
eating a thing of grapes.

20:22.288 --> 20:23.487
Like, some are a little sweeter,

20:23.489 --> 20:24.889
some are a little tartier,

20:24.891 --> 20:27.291
some are weird and pruny.

20:27.293 --> 20:30.428
But at the end of the day,
they all taste like grapes.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.797
-[Ben whistles] Oh...
-[all snap fingers]

20:32.799 --> 20:34.832
I'm just-- Look--
No, I'm just sayin',

20:34.834 --> 20:37.301
don't get your hopes up--
a grape is a grape.

20:37.303 --> 20:39.537
-[Mel] Food...
-[James] Yes, it is.

20:41.241 --> 20:43.474
-[Ben] Thank you.
-[waiter] You're welcome.

20:43.476 --> 20:45.543
-[James] Thank you, sir.
-[utensils clanging]

20:45.545 --> 20:48.479
-[waiter]
Can I get you anything else?
-I think we're good, thank you.

20:48.481 --> 20:50.014
[waiter] Enjoy.

20:52.252 --> 20:53.751
Is that Marco?

20:53.753 --> 20:55.386
That's why you were
so desperate to come here?

20:55.388 --> 20:57.355
-Who's Marco?
-Shh.

20:57.357 --> 20:58.956
Oh, I ordered
the wrong thing.

20:58.958 --> 21:01.959
-Can I have yours
instead, boo? Thank you.
-I was-- Um--

21:01.961 --> 21:04.262
-[whispering] Who's Marco?
-Mm-mm.

21:04.264 --> 21:07.331
-I want to know about Marco.
-Quiet. Don't say it again.

21:07.333 --> 21:09.033
Say it again.

21:11.304 --> 21:12.903
I really fucking
envy you, man.

21:12.905 --> 21:14.805
Don't.
It's not all great.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.540
I meet this one girl
a few days ago,

21:16.542 --> 21:17.875
and she's really weird.

21:17.877 --> 21:19.343
I'm so wet right now.

21:19.345 --> 21:21.345
Yeah?
I mean, cool.

21:21.347 --> 21:23.848
I'm gonna take a nice,
relaxing shower.

21:23.850 --> 21:26.317
-Do you wanna watch?
-Yeah, sure.

21:26.319 --> 21:27.985
Great.
Just click the link below

21:27.987 --> 21:29.754
-to accept my invite.
-What?

21:29.756 --> 21:31.489
These bots
are getting really good.

21:31.491 --> 21:33.291
We had a two hour conversation
about Wes Anderson

21:33.293 --> 21:34.892
before I realized
I wasn't talking to anybody.

21:34.894 --> 21:37.461
Yeah, but for the most part,
it's really easy, right?

21:37.463 --> 21:38.963
Eh...

21:38.965 --> 21:41.065
If I were you,
I would go on a fucking tear.

21:41.067 --> 21:42.633
[chuckles]

21:42.635 --> 21:44.068
You know I've only had
sex with two women, right?

21:44.070 --> 21:45.836
There you are.
Can we go, please?

21:45.838 --> 21:47.638
'Cause I'm tryin' to cut down
on the amount of time

21:47.640 --> 21:49.507
I spend with heteros
and I'm way over my limit

21:49.509 --> 21:50.708
for the month.

21:50.710 --> 21:51.942
[keyboard clacking]

21:54.080 --> 21:56.580
-Oh, my God.
-What?

21:57.450 --> 21:59.350
Brilliant idea.

21:59.352 --> 22:00.685
What's up?

22:00.687 --> 22:03.354
We should make
Tinder accounts.

22:05.325 --> 22:06.957
What-- Why?

22:06.959 --> 22:10.328
So we can look
at other people's
profiles and judge them.

22:10.330 --> 22:12.363
Duh. [laughs]

22:12.999 --> 22:14.598
Come on, we won't--

22:14.600 --> 22:16.367
We won't message anyone,

22:16.369 --> 22:19.103
and we'll just delete
our accounts after tonight.

22:20.406 --> 22:22.807
Come on, it'll be fun.

22:22.809 --> 22:24.709
What picture
are you using?

22:24.711 --> 22:26.744
I'm using the one
from my boat trip,

22:26.746 --> 22:29.714
where the sun is in my eyes
and my face is all like...

22:29.716 --> 22:33.417
God. The one that
Blowjob Wiggins liked.

22:33.419 --> 22:35.553
Have you noticed that
in every one of her photos,

22:35.555 --> 22:37.855
she, she stretches her neck out

22:37.857 --> 22:40.891
like an ostrich. She--

22:40.893 --> 22:42.526
You're not even
her friend on Facebook.

22:42.528 --> 22:44.628
I go into
your profile sometimes.

22:45.765 --> 22:47.631
You don't look pretty
in the picture.

22:47.633 --> 22:49.433
You look constipated.

22:50.470 --> 22:52.570
[police siren blaring
in distance]

22:57.877 --> 23:00.745
[swiping sound]

23:02.415 --> 23:04.682
How many matches
do you have?

23:04.684 --> 23:06.717
Only 38. You?

23:06.719 --> 23:09.053
"Only 38"?
I have two.

23:09.622 --> 23:11.422
Let me see.

23:13.893 --> 23:16.794
Oh, well,
this Erin girl is a bot.

23:16.796 --> 23:18.662
Okay, great.
So I have one.

23:18.664 --> 23:21.065
Yeah, but Gwen
just messaged you.

23:21.067 --> 23:22.666
Really?

23:22.668 --> 23:24.568
What did she say?

23:25.538 --> 23:27.905
"You look like
you have to...

23:28.908 --> 23:30.641
poop."

23:30.643 --> 23:33.110
-That's not funny.
-[Mel laughs]

23:33.112 --> 23:35.546
Some of my messages
are really lude.

23:35.548 --> 23:38.082
Tyler says
I have a fuckable ass.

23:38.084 --> 23:39.550
We know that.

23:39.552 --> 23:42.453
Jordan says that he would like

23:42.455 --> 23:44.622
to eat me out for a year.

23:44.624 --> 23:46.190
A year, James.

23:46.192 --> 23:48.859
One time I said I wasn't crazy
about cunnilingus,

23:48.861 --> 23:50.494
and that was because
you said you felt--

23:50.496 --> 23:52.096
you felt
self-conscious about it.

23:52.098 --> 23:54.098
What-- No, I'm just saying
because of the message.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.100
No, this is what's wrong
with these apps, all right.

23:56.102 --> 23:57.868
It just gives
a bunch a pervs a reason

23:57.870 --> 23:59.937
to verbally assault women
on these forums.

23:59.939 --> 24:01.939
Why are you being
so angry and feminist?

24:01.941 --> 24:04.742
-I'm not, okay. I di--
-Most of us actually care--

24:04.744 --> 24:06.610
I didn't want to do this.

24:07.647 --> 24:09.914
[swiping sound]

24:13.586 --> 24:15.019
[sighs]

24:22.495 --> 24:24.695
[keyboard clacking softly]

24:41.013 --> 24:42.780
Over the past three months,
I have been on

24:42.782 --> 24:45.015
16 different dates
with 16 different women,

24:45.017 --> 24:46.851
<i> and for the most part,</i>

24:46.853 --> 24:49.119
<i> these women, who I suddenly</i>
<i> found in front of me</i>

24:49.121 --> 24:52.022
<i> were pretty attractive</i>
<i> and intelligent.</i>

24:52.024 --> 24:54.258
I'm just finishing up
my master's in econ.

24:54.260 --> 24:56.193
But my real passion
is poetry.

24:56.195 --> 24:59.230
<i> And they all had really</i>
<i> interesting things to say.</i>

24:59.232 --> 25:01.732
Did you know that
an adult eagle

25:01.734 --> 25:04.702
can pick up
a full grown deer

25:04.704 --> 25:07.171
-and fly away with it?
-That's very interesting.

25:07.173 --> 25:08.672
I mean, it's not
contextually relevant,

25:08.674 --> 25:10.274
but it's very--
it's interesting.

25:10.276 --> 25:12.009
<i> And they all had</i>
<i> different jobs and passions.</i>

25:12.011 --> 25:13.744
I'm in financial planning.

25:13.746 --> 25:15.813
I'm in the police academy.

25:15.815 --> 25:18.849
I'm a social media branding
coordination strategist.

25:18.851 --> 25:21.752
-That's not a thing.
-Yeah, you're right.

25:21.754 --> 25:23.954
<i> I think I got the hang</i>
<i> of things pretty quickly.</i>

25:23.956 --> 25:26.557
<i> You know, asking questions</i>
<i> that were interesting,</i>

25:26.559 --> 25:28.626
<i> but not too prying,</i>
<i> giving compliments</i>

25:28.628 --> 25:30.761
<i> that were specific</i>
<i> without being creepy,</i>

25:30.763 --> 25:33.964
<i> seeming at once accessible,</i>
<i> and aloof.</i>

25:35.535 --> 25:38.235
-[moaning] Oh, God.
-Oh, God.

25:38.237 --> 25:39.537
Oh, God!

25:39.539 --> 25:41.305
[different woman]
Oh, God!

25:41.307 --> 25:43.073
Oh, God!

25:45.044 --> 25:47.645
-Did you just cum?
-Maybe.

25:47.647 --> 25:49.580
They weren't all great dates.
Some of them were

25:49.582 --> 25:51.015
completely disinterested in me.

25:51.017 --> 25:52.783
Do you like working
in communications?

25:52.785 --> 25:53.884
[buttons clacking]

25:53.886 --> 25:55.586
<i> Or very uncomfortable.</i>

25:55.588 --> 25:58.188
I, uh--
Well, you see, um--

25:58.190 --> 25:59.823
But when--

25:59.825 --> 26:01.625
<i> Or entirely too comfortable.</i>

26:01.627 --> 26:03.127
Can I get you
something to drink?

26:03.129 --> 26:04.862
Oh, sorry, I can't drink.

26:04.864 --> 26:07.631
I'm on this new medication
for an infection I have.

26:07.633 --> 26:10.334
Oh. That was
probably T.M.I., right?

26:10.336 --> 26:12.803
My psychiatrist says
I need to use better judgment

26:12.805 --> 26:14.238
about when it's okay
to be honest.

26:14.240 --> 26:15.739
It's fine.

26:15.741 --> 26:17.308
Heh. Let's just talk
about something else.

26:17.310 --> 26:19.176
Are both your parents living?
Because mine aren't.

26:19.178 --> 26:22.346
I began to feel less
like I was going on dates,

26:22.348 --> 26:24.815
and more like
I was interviewing them
for some kind of census.

26:24.817 --> 26:26.717
The same questions,
the same answers.

26:26.719 --> 26:28.852
And soon, all these women
who had seemed

26:28.854 --> 26:30.254
so different and unique,

26:30.256 --> 26:32.089
all started
to sort of blend together.

26:32.091 --> 26:34.658
I started noticing patterns,
like how a lot of the ones

26:34.660 --> 26:38.662
who swipe right on me,
loved intramural soccer
and Boba tea,

26:38.664 --> 26:40.664
and how they all seemed
to have these really great

26:40.666 --> 26:43.901
and hilarious older brothers,
named like, Greg or Steve.

26:43.903 --> 26:46.904
Also, I realized that
I had great text chemistry

26:46.906 --> 26:49.807
with girls who liked anime,
but the second we met up...

26:49.809 --> 26:51.308
I don't like you.

26:56.949 --> 26:58.749
[phone shutter clicks]

26:58.751 --> 27:01.919
Oh, um, now, I actually
wanted to tell you something.

27:01.921 --> 27:07.358
I met up with that couple
I was telling you about, and...

27:07.360 --> 27:09.627
Well, I had a three-way!

27:10.663 --> 27:12.363
When?

27:12.365 --> 27:14.231
Three months ago.

27:14.233 --> 27:15.933
And you're
just telling me now?

27:15.935 --> 27:17.668
Can you take a photo of me?

27:17.670 --> 27:19.336
Ever since Ben unfriended me,
there's literally

27:19.338 --> 27:21.372
no good pictures
of me online.

27:21.374 --> 27:22.773
[phone shutter clicks]

27:22.775 --> 27:24.308
So how was it?

27:24.310 --> 27:27.144
-My cheeks look weird.
-The three-way, Rachel.

27:27.146 --> 27:29.279
I liked it. I mean
all the attention.

27:29.281 --> 27:31.048
It felt good.

27:31.050 --> 27:34.351
[laughs] I just can't believe
that you, you did that.

27:34.353 --> 27:36.654
You and James should try it.

27:36.656 --> 27:39.690
Yeah, well, I think
James and I can manage

27:39.692 --> 27:42.126
without boinking
weird strangers.

27:43.696 --> 27:45.062
All right.

27:46.699 --> 27:48.966
I'm sorry...

27:48.968 --> 27:50.968
I'm a little jealous,
I guess.

27:50.970 --> 27:52.736
What? Really?

27:52.738 --> 27:54.805
Yeah. It--

27:54.807 --> 27:58.809
I don't know,
I feel like I'm in
middle school again, and...

27:58.811 --> 28:01.078
I don't know, I just--
I'm not very experienced,

28:01.080 --> 28:02.813
and it's stupid. Just--

28:02.815 --> 28:06.316
Mel, you have nothing
to be jealous about.

28:06.318 --> 28:09.219
Honestly, my therapist said
that the only reason why

28:09.221 --> 28:11.889
I did it was because I was
having a panicky reaction

28:11.891 --> 28:13.290
to your engagement.

28:13.292 --> 28:15.459
Really?
You mean that?

28:15.461 --> 28:17.327
I only saw them once,
then I started

28:17.329 --> 28:18.962
hooking up
with a couple Tinder randos.

28:18.964 --> 28:20.264
How many?

28:21.834 --> 28:23.267
[Rachel moans]

28:23.269 --> 28:24.802
Wait...

28:24.804 --> 28:27.771
Is this another dude's
blue Oxford button down?

28:28.441 --> 28:29.740
Uh...

28:29.742 --> 28:30.941
Uh...

28:30.943 --> 28:32.376
Two or three, I think.

28:32.378 --> 28:35.179
Then I started dating
this older guy, Richard.

28:35.181 --> 28:37.815
-How old?
-Forties.

28:40.486 --> 28:42.853
[phone vibrates]

28:42.855 --> 28:46.457
I think someone...
in your family might've died.

28:46.459 --> 28:49.359
-What?
-Your phone has been vibrating

28:49.361 --> 28:51.195
-for the past 30 minutes.
-Oh.

28:51.197 --> 28:53.063
Someone's desperately trying
to get a hold of you.

28:53.065 --> 28:54.732
Mmm. That-- No.

28:54.734 --> 28:56.033
[scoffs]

28:56.035 --> 28:58.001
I'm just a part of
three group texts.

28:58.003 --> 29:00.137
Either someone is having
an emotional breakdown

29:00.139 --> 29:01.772
or brunch plans
are being made.

29:01.774 --> 29:03.373
-[laughs]
-Either way, no big deal.

29:07.747 --> 29:09.980
[grunts]
I have an idea.

29:12.284 --> 29:13.484
What--?

29:14.887 --> 29:16.353
Follow me.

29:17.289 --> 29:20.023
Richard, where are you going?

29:26.232 --> 29:27.531
Richard?

29:27.533 --> 29:30.134
[dramatic music playing]

29:38.144 --> 29:39.777
Richard, are you in there?

29:39.779 --> 29:41.545
[Richard]
Yeah, babe, come on in.

29:41.547 --> 29:43.881
[Rachel]
If this is your murder chamber,

29:43.883 --> 29:45.549
I'm gonna be so pissed.

29:50.856 --> 29:53.257
Why are you sweating so much?

29:53.259 --> 29:55.425
So it turns out,
he's a chiropractor,

29:55.427 --> 29:58.095
and wanted to do work on me,
because apparently I have

29:58.097 --> 30:00.798
the back of an 80-year-old
with double D's.

30:00.800 --> 30:03.500
I think in like,
three dates,

30:03.502 --> 30:06.870
he did over a thousand dollars
with of chiropractic work on me.

30:06.872 --> 30:09.006
Wow! Are you
still seeing him?

30:09.008 --> 30:12.209
Not really.
I mean, my back is fixed.

30:12.211 --> 30:15.245
-Hey, Mel.
-Dustin. [chuckles]

30:15.247 --> 30:16.947
You know, I was actually
just thinking about you.

30:16.949 --> 30:19.016
Really? Uh, cool.

30:19.018 --> 30:21.218
This is my friend Rachel.
Rachel, Dustin.

30:21.220 --> 30:23.020
How is it goin'? You know,
I've actually seen

30:23.022 --> 30:25.255
some of your stuff on YouTube,
and your imitation

30:25.257 --> 30:28.091
of a masturbating octopus
is pretty funny.

30:28.093 --> 30:31.361
Thank you.
That actually came
from a very real place.

30:31.363 --> 30:33.030
Oh, I can tell because

30:33.032 --> 30:36.500
I am a quarter jellyfish
on my father's side.

30:36.502 --> 30:39.503
Really? I swore
I saw a stingray in you.

30:39.505 --> 30:41.538
-[laughs]
-So why were you thinking of me?

30:41.540 --> 30:44.174
Oh. Um, because
I promised a friend of mine

30:44.176 --> 30:46.210
who works for this retirement
facility that I would come in

30:46.212 --> 30:48.478
and do some improv exercises
with the residents tomorrow,

30:48.480 --> 30:51.248
and I was hoping I might find
a teacher's assistant?

30:51.250 --> 30:53.083
-You got one.
-Great.

30:53.085 --> 30:54.918
I'll text you the address.

30:54.920 --> 30:56.954
Rachel, you should come too.

30:56.956 --> 31:00.357
Oh, no, she has
a regular 9 to 5 job, so--

31:00.359 --> 31:03.026
You know, my boss is actually
recovering from Coachella,

31:03.028 --> 31:04.595
so I have the whole week off.

31:04.597 --> 31:06.496
But you've
never done improv, so--

31:06.498 --> 31:08.332
Well, can't I just learn
as we go along?

31:08.334 --> 31:10.500
Isn't that how improv works?

31:10.502 --> 31:12.536
You improvise.

31:12.538 --> 31:14.037
She's an expert already.

31:14.039 --> 31:15.606
-Cool.
-Great.

31:16.909 --> 31:19.576
Hello,
Sunshine Senior Care Center.

31:19.578 --> 31:21.311
-Ha-ha.
-[dead quiet response]

31:21.313 --> 31:23.614
How's everybody doin'?

31:26.151 --> 31:28.886
Okay, um, my name is Dustin,

31:28.888 --> 31:33.257
and I'm going to teach you
some improvisational exercises.

31:36.095 --> 31:38.662
Why don't we, uh,
do an exercise?

31:38.664 --> 31:41.164
I bet that'll make sense,
get things moving.

31:41.166 --> 31:44.468
Uh, Melissa and Rachel,
you guys wanna come up here?

31:47.006 --> 31:51.174
Okay. Um, now,
they're gonna walk around,

31:51.176 --> 31:54.311
and when I shout
an adjective or a noun,

31:54.313 --> 31:58.081
they're gonna change their walk
in accordance with that word.

31:58.083 --> 32:00.017
Okay, guys?

32:00.019 --> 32:01.518
Begin.

32:02.388 --> 32:03.954
Heavy.

32:03.956 --> 32:06.189
Make your walks heavier.

32:09.094 --> 32:10.560
Friendly.

32:13.699 --> 32:16.700
Wow, very friendly. [laughs]

32:16.702 --> 32:18.402
Um, okay...

32:18.404 --> 32:19.670
Snake.

32:21.140 --> 32:23.206
[Rachel making
slithering sounds]

32:24.543 --> 32:26.944
Um, o-- Okay then.

32:26.946 --> 32:28.512
Uh, I think everyone's got it.

32:28.514 --> 32:30.280
Uh, now it's your turn.

32:30.282 --> 32:32.549
[upbeat music playing]

33:22.568 --> 33:24.368
Thanks so much
for helping out.

33:24.370 --> 33:27.604
Definitely. And if you
ever need help with this again,

33:27.606 --> 33:30.007
or just want to hang out,
feel free to text me.

33:30.009 --> 33:33.043
I drive for Swyft now,
so my schedule's very flexible.

33:33.045 --> 33:35.112
I actually wanted
to talk to you.

33:35.114 --> 33:36.780
Uh, Jill from Pizza Hat

33:36.782 --> 33:40.083
just got staffed as a writer
on this MTV sitcom,

33:40.085 --> 33:43.053
so we're looking
for a new female to replace her,

33:43.055 --> 33:45.022
and I mentioned your name.

33:45.024 --> 33:47.257
You did? [laughs]
That's amazing.

33:47.259 --> 33:49.026
No, it's not decided yet.

33:49.028 --> 33:51.261
Um, it's between you
and a few other girls.

33:51.263 --> 33:53.330
Just let me know
when your next show is,

33:53.332 --> 33:55.565
and I'll bring Spike
and the other guys by
to check you out.

33:55.567 --> 33:59.436
Okay. Uh, I think we have one
at the end of the month.

33:59.438 --> 34:02.239
Hey, just throwing
this out there.

34:02.241 --> 34:05.275
Maybe you could bring on
more than one girl?

34:05.277 --> 34:07.177
Yeah, we talked about that,

34:07.179 --> 34:09.046
but Spike's pretty adamant.

34:09.048 --> 34:11.581
You know,
the six guy, one girl dynamic

34:11.583 --> 34:13.283
is what powers Pizza Hat, so...

34:13.285 --> 34:16.153
-That was so much fun.
-Told ya.

34:17.056 --> 34:19.289
Um, all right,
I got to go.

34:19.291 --> 34:21.658
-See you Saturday, Rach?
-All right, I'll see you then.

34:21.660 --> 34:23.293
Cool.
See you around, Melissa.

34:23.295 --> 34:24.761
And let me know
when that show is.

34:24.763 --> 34:26.329
[dry chuckle]

34:26.331 --> 34:27.764
What's on Saturday?

34:27.766 --> 34:30.634
Oh, Dustin invited
me to one of his shows.

34:30.636 --> 34:32.836
-That's okay, right?
-Of course it is.

34:32.838 --> 34:36.773
I just thought you said
improv makes you nervous?

34:37.443 --> 34:38.842
It does. I just--

34:38.844 --> 34:40.744
He seems so nice.

34:41.613 --> 34:43.213
Right.

34:43.215 --> 34:45.715
Mel, I actually wanted
to tell you something.

34:45.717 --> 34:47.851
-I saw James on Tinder.
-What?

34:47.853 --> 34:50.754
I was on the other day,
and he showed up.

34:50.756 --> 34:52.589
I mean, I wouldn't worry
too much about it.

34:52.591 --> 34:54.391
I'm sure
it was just a joke.

34:56.228 --> 35:00.297
We deleted the app on our phone
after the little experiment.

35:00.299 --> 35:03.533

<i> That can happen, right?</i>

[Jazz music playing]

35:41.640 --> 35:43.907
I'm-- I'm so sorry
I'm late.

35:43.909 --> 35:45.775
Traffic was so shitty,
and my phone died,

35:45.777 --> 35:48.145
so I couldn't text you--
I hope you weren't waiting long.

35:48.147 --> 35:50.280
No, no, not at all.
Um, yeah, here.

35:50.282 --> 35:51.681
Okay.

35:53.919 --> 35:55.318
Oh. That was here.

35:55.320 --> 35:56.887
Oh, perfect.

35:56.889 --> 36:00.624
I'm just gonna--
So, Ben, you, um...

-How many times did you text me?
-[notifications dinging]

36:04.429 --> 36:06.663
I was just
concerned that, um--

36:06.665 --> 36:08.865
I just wanted to make sure
you were-- you were on--

36:08.867 --> 36:10.734
everything was--
I wasn't sure if

36:10.736 --> 36:12.402
-something had pa-- Um--
-[Gabriele scoffs]

36:12.404 --> 36:14.504
[laughing]

36:15.274 --> 36:16.473
Not cool.

36:16.475 --> 36:18.275
It's all right.

36:20.479 --> 36:22.279
-[Ben] Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

36:22.281 --> 36:24.948
So yeah, I took
the LSAT last month,

36:24.950 --> 36:26.917
and I'm working at the mall
and living at home

36:26.919 --> 36:28.585
while I wait
to hear back from schools.

36:28.587 --> 36:30.620
What made you
want to get into law?

36:30.622 --> 36:32.189
I have a really good
serious face.

36:32.191 --> 36:33.456
I just didn't want
to waste it.

36:33.458 --> 36:34.758
Oh, let's see it.

36:34.760 --> 36:36.493
Oh, yeah, that is
a good serious face.

36:36.495 --> 36:38.361
-You weren't kidding.
-I know, right?

36:38.363 --> 36:39.462
[chuckles]

36:39.464 --> 36:40.764
-Wanna sit?
-Yeah.

36:40.766 --> 36:42.399
-Yeah.
-Well, what about you?

36:42.401 --> 36:45.202
Tell me about
being a writer.
What do you write?

36:45.204 --> 36:46.803
Uh, well, I'd like
to write for television,

36:46.805 --> 36:49.239
which is stupid,
because everybody
wants to do that.

36:49.241 --> 36:50.473
Oh, cool. Like what?

36:50.475 --> 36:51.641
Uh, I really like drama.

36:51.643 --> 36:53.810
Like<i> Breaking Bad, The Wire.</i>

36:53.812 --> 36:55.645
-Like that.
-I haven't seen those.

36:55.647 --> 36:56.947
I don't watch
a lot of TV.

36:56.949 --> 36:59.216
So what have
you written for?

36:59.218 --> 37:00.617
Nothing yet.

37:00.619 --> 37:02.519
You kind of need to know
somebody to break in,

37:02.521 --> 37:04.454
so right now,
I must write click bait.

37:04.456 --> 37:06.656
Still, you're
following your dream.

37:06.658 --> 37:08.992
Yeah, I'm starting to think
I might be happier if I wasn't.

37:08.994 --> 37:11.361
-How do you mean?
-Well...

37:11.363 --> 37:13.597
Just like, my whole life,
every adult I've ever known--

37:13.599 --> 37:15.365
parents, teachers,
orthodontists--

37:15.367 --> 37:17.300
told me I'm special
and talented,

37:17.302 --> 37:19.269
and if I worked hard enough,
I could accomplish my dreams.

37:19.271 --> 37:21.004
You know, I got sent
to like writing camps

37:21.006 --> 37:23.607
and elite universities,
and special abroad programs,

37:23.609 --> 37:26.009
and now I'm here,
and I'm unemployed,

37:26.011 --> 37:28.411
and I'm competing against
thousands of other people

37:28.413 --> 37:30.580
who were told that they were
special and they were talented,

37:30.582 --> 37:32.882
and if they just worked
really hard, they could
accomplish their dreams,

37:32.884 --> 37:35.485
and there's just no way
we could all be that special.

37:35.487 --> 37:38.255
-You know?
-Mmm. Mmm.

37:38.257 --> 37:40.290
That sounds rough, dude.

37:40.292 --> 37:42.425
So I'm working
on an abroad program...

37:42.427 --> 37:43.827
-Oh, shit.
-I'm sorry. [chuckles]

37:43.829 --> 37:45.495
-No.
-It was a--

37:45.497 --> 37:46.730
No, you got me.

37:46.732 --> 37:50.467
Um, so what is
click bait?

37:51.503 --> 37:54.371
Um, it's like
an article with...

37:54.373 --> 37:56.906
a misleadingly
flashy headline
to get you to click on it.

37:56.908 --> 37:58.975
-Like what?
-Like the other week,

37:58.977 --> 38:01.378
a paparazzi took a photo of
Mark Ruffalo eating ice cream,

38:01.380 --> 38:03.013
and I wrote an article called,
"You'll Never Guess

38:03.015 --> 38:04.514
Where Mark Ruffalo Puts
His Ice Cream."

38:04.516 --> 38:06.316
Oh, I get it.
Because it implies

38:06.318 --> 38:08.518
Mark Ruffalo sticks
ice cream up his butt.

38:08.520 --> 38:10.487
-Yeah. That's really clever.
-Right. Yeah.

38:10.489 --> 38:12.055
Thank you.
I mean, well, for spam.

38:12.057 --> 38:14.391
No, it's funny.
You shouldn't be
so hard on yourself.

38:14.393 --> 38:17.627
Oh. Well, here's
my Swyft, so...

38:17.629 --> 38:19.596
Oh. Uh. Hey.

38:19.598 --> 38:21.831
-Do you want to go out again?
-Yeah. Yeah.

38:21.833 --> 38:23.633
-Tuesday?
-Oh, I can't do Tuesdays.

38:23.635 --> 38:25.902
No, yeah, that'd be great.
Sorry, it was a weird joke.

38:25.904 --> 38:28.338
-Yeah, Tuesday would be great.
-Okay, cool.

38:28.340 --> 38:30.373
I just didn't want to wait
three days to send you text.

38:30.375 --> 38:31.741
Yeah, I know.

38:31.743 --> 38:34.511
-Oh, would you mind?
-Oh, sure, yeah. Please.

38:34.513 --> 38:36.546
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

38:39.418 --> 38:43.353
<i> ¶ Let your mind be free ¶</i>

38:43.355 --> 38:44.788
[spoon clanging in ceramic bowl]

38:44.790 --> 38:47.624
<i> ¶ To think of the future ¶</i>

38:48.360 --> 38:49.893

38:49.895 --> 38:52.329

38:53.899 --> 38:56.866

38:58.370 --> 38:59.869
I have an idea.

38:59.871 --> 39:01.071
[James] Hmm?

39:01.073 --> 39:02.706
Let's re-download Tinder

39:02.708 --> 39:05.542
and switch phones
with each other.

39:05.544 --> 39:07.110
I think it'd be
really interesting

39:07.112 --> 39:08.845
to see what girl you like.

39:09.881 --> 39:11.414
What?

39:11.416 --> 39:14.551
Come on,
let's switch phones.

39:14.553 --> 39:18.488
Babe, see I'm busy
right now?

39:19.558 --> 39:21.091
All right,
I'll borrow yours.

39:21.093 --> 39:22.592
[muffled]
No, wait. Why?
What are you--?

39:22.594 --> 39:26.062
There's no--
You don't need to.

39:26.064 --> 39:28.498
I've already
seen it, James.

39:29.768 --> 39:31.101
What?

39:32.637 --> 39:35.138
You're messaging
a lot of girls.

39:36.141 --> 39:37.440
A lot, a lot.

39:37.442 --> 39:39.376
[dry chuckle]

39:39.378 --> 39:41.511
Wait, so...

39:41.513 --> 39:43.380
you're going
through my phone now?

39:43.382 --> 39:45.415
The things
you say to them.

39:45.417 --> 39:47.851
-Jokes.
-Hmm?

39:47.853 --> 39:52.422
You offered to take
several girls to "pound town",

39:52.424 --> 39:55.425
and you told
some slutty Asian
that you wanted

39:55.427 --> 39:57.394
-to be her fuck slave.
-[James laughs]

39:57.396 --> 39:59.863
-I mean, what the fuck, James?
-[laughs]

40:00.632 --> 40:02.732
-No. No!
-Stop laughing!

40:02.734 --> 40:04.601
They're just jokes.
I was just trying to see

40:04.603 --> 40:06.035
if that even works
on any girls.

40:06.037 --> 40:08.872
-Like--
-Why would you do this to me?

40:08.874 --> 40:11.107
Do what?
I didn't do anything.

40:11.109 --> 40:12.976
It's not like I met up
with these girls.

40:12.978 --> 40:14.677
Yeah, I went out
with James once.

40:14.679 --> 40:16.613
There wasn't
really any chemistry.

40:16.615 --> 40:19.582
I think we hung out like, mmm,

40:19.584 --> 40:21.184
two or three times.

40:21.186 --> 40:24.554
We might've made out
a little bit.

40:24.556 --> 40:26.556
After we slept together,
he broke down,

40:26.558 --> 40:29.459
and started crying about
how much he loved his fiancé.

40:29.461 --> 40:32.095
So I listened to him
for like two hours,

40:32.097 --> 40:34.798
and then he didn't even have
the decency to text me after.

40:34.800 --> 40:35.999
Asshole.

40:36.001 --> 40:37.634
You're an asshole.

40:37.636 --> 40:39.869
An ass--
How am I an asshole?

40:39.871 --> 40:41.471
I didn't even cheat.

40:41.473 --> 40:43.673
Cheating,
I could wrap my head around.

40:43.675 --> 40:45.442
But this?

40:45.444 --> 40:47.844
It's so much more unsavory.

40:47.846 --> 40:50.213
Okay, I think
you're over reacting,

40:50.215 --> 40:52.582
because this is
not that big of a deal.

40:53.718 --> 40:54.984
It's a big deal to me,

40:54.986 --> 40:56.920
so it's a big deal, okay?

40:56.922 --> 40:59.622
Okay. Okay.

41:09.468 --> 41:11.134
[scoffs]

41:12.103 --> 41:14.671
I think we need
to take a break.

41:19.945 --> 41:23.613
Okay, you've opened and closed
the same folder three times.

41:23.615 --> 41:24.981
Well, I can't find the file

41:24.983 --> 41:26.983
that my boss
is freaking out about.

41:26.985 --> 41:29.986
I'm seriously
like this close to quitting.

41:31.490 --> 41:33.122
-Okay.
-Whoa--

41:36.061 --> 41:37.794
Fine.

41:37.796 --> 41:39.796
-So when are you quitting?
-Next month.

41:39.798 --> 41:42.565
Well, definitely
by the end of Summer.

41:42.567 --> 41:44.601
And what will you do?

41:46.004 --> 41:48.972
I don't know,
probably the same thing
somewhere else.

41:48.974 --> 41:51.508
Really, I don't know
what I want.

41:51.510 --> 41:55.245
I just-- I know
that I want more of it.

41:55.247 --> 41:57.514
You know what I mean?

41:57.516 --> 41:58.781
No.

41:58.783 --> 42:00.049
[scoffs]

42:00.051 --> 42:02.785
Like, well,
what do you want?

42:02.787 --> 42:06.022
What are your,
your big plans?

42:06.024 --> 42:08.558
When I was a kid,
all I wanted to do

42:08.560 --> 42:11.561
was make people laugh,

42:11.563 --> 42:14.030
and have sex
with pretty girls.

42:14.032 --> 42:16.099
[scoffs] No.

42:16.101 --> 42:17.700
I don't buy it.

42:17.702 --> 42:19.536
Well, if you don't believe me,

42:19.538 --> 42:21.137
then ask him for yourself.

42:22.607 --> 42:25.775
So wait,
you had sex with us?

42:26.912 --> 42:28.745
Whoa, that's awesome.

42:28.747 --> 42:30.246
Can I ask you something?

42:30.248 --> 42:32.849
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

42:33.718 --> 42:35.151
I don't know.

42:35.153 --> 42:37.787
I think I just want
to make people laugh.

42:37.789 --> 42:39.289
See.

42:39.291 --> 42:41.925
So I can get on television
and movies,

42:41.927 --> 42:44.160
and be famous.
We're famous, right?

42:45.564 --> 42:47.030
Fine.

42:47.032 --> 42:50.567
I want to be rich and famous.

42:50.569 --> 42:52.735
So what.

42:52.737 --> 42:54.070
What did you want to do then?

42:54.072 --> 42:56.239
What I wanted was to be married

42:56.241 --> 42:58.942
to be married
to Leonardo DiCaprio.

42:58.944 --> 43:01.611
Not in bed with a guy

43:01.613 --> 43:03.580
that looks like a giant Muppet.

43:03.582 --> 43:05.949
-Want some chips?
-[scoffs]

43:05.951 --> 43:09.319
I'm sorry, I used to be
very critical of people.

43:09.321 --> 43:11.754
And where did you get
those chips? Are those mine?

43:11.756 --> 43:13.957
-Whose place is this?
-Mine.

43:13.959 --> 43:17.727
Whoa, we must make
a lot of money.

43:17.729 --> 43:19.829
I'm doin' okay.

43:19.831 --> 43:21.631
I'm the head of marketing--

43:21.633 --> 43:22.865
So we're the boss of people?

43:22.867 --> 43:24.334
Do we yell at them?

43:24.336 --> 43:25.868
Yeah. Sometimes,

43:25.870 --> 43:28.004
when I forget
to drink my coffee.

43:28.006 --> 43:29.806
That's so cool!

43:29.808 --> 43:32.208
I can't wait
to be in my 20's.

43:36.381 --> 43:37.880
Something wrong?

43:42.621 --> 43:45.188
Don't be too nice, too soon.

43:45.924 --> 43:47.357
I hate that.

43:49.995 --> 43:51.694
And no pussy gripping this time.

43:51.696 --> 43:53.963
-Really choke me.
-[chuckles]

43:55.800 --> 43:58.267
[both moaning]

44:09.414 --> 44:10.780
[moaning stops]

44:10.782 --> 44:12.281
[exasperated breathing]

44:12.283 --> 44:13.783
[Ben] Oh, God.

44:14.853 --> 44:16.386
That was good.

44:17.656 --> 44:19.155
A few more times, and uh,

44:19.157 --> 44:21.691
I think you'll really have
the hang of it.

44:21.693 --> 44:23.192
Shut up.

44:23.194 --> 44:25.061
[sighs]
What do you want to do now?

44:25.063 --> 44:26.863
You want to, uh,
go to the gym?

44:26.865 --> 44:29.232
Watch each other do squats
for a couple hours, or...?

44:29.234 --> 44:30.800
[both laugh]

44:30.802 --> 44:32.235
I don't know. Um...

44:32.237 --> 44:35.271
how about
we smoke some pot?

44:35.273 --> 44:36.806
You have some, right?

44:36.808 --> 44:39.242
Now, why do you assume
that I have pot?

44:39.244 --> 44:42.011
I don't know, I thought
all white guys smoked pot.

44:43.848 --> 44:46.749
I might have a little.
But why do you want to?

44:46.751 --> 44:49.752
Mmm... I want
to try it again.

44:49.754 --> 44:51.988
I mean, I never really
did it in high school,

44:51.990 --> 44:54.157
because I was a big nerd,
and I thought

44:54.159 --> 44:55.992
if I took one hit,
it would ruin my chances

44:55.994 --> 44:57.460
of getting a scholarship.

44:57.462 --> 45:00.229
And that
I smoked once in college,

45:00.231 --> 45:01.998
but I didn't really feel it,

45:02.000 --> 45:04.701
and now I'm goin'
to law school,

45:04.703 --> 45:06.703
and I just feel like
I just need to see

45:06.705 --> 45:09.238
-what it's all about, you know?
-Yeah.

45:09.240 --> 45:11.140
So I just picked this up
from the dispensary.

45:11.142 --> 45:13.409
It's pretty strong,
so just have a little bit.

45:13.411 --> 45:15.378
-Okay.
-And if you start to feel

45:15.380 --> 45:16.879
like freaked out
or paranoid,

45:16.881 --> 45:18.081
it's just the weed,
you're fine.

45:18.083 --> 45:19.348
You're totally fine.

45:19.350 --> 45:20.783
Okay.

45:20.785 --> 45:22.051
I'm having a tough time

45:22.053 --> 45:24.053
not smiling,
is that normal?

45:25.123 --> 45:26.789
I knew this kid
when I was little,

45:26.791 --> 45:28.458
he could never stop smiling.

45:28.460 --> 45:30.359
Even when his mom
was yelling at him,

45:30.361 --> 45:33.229
[laughs] I saw him,
I saw him cry once,

45:33.231 --> 45:35.798
and he was
still kind of smiling.

45:35.800 --> 45:38.868
[laughs]

45:39.938 --> 45:41.838
Manuel Hernandez.

45:41.840 --> 45:44.307
Oh, man.

45:44.309 --> 45:45.842
His mom and my mom
worked together,

45:45.844 --> 45:48.778
so I spent a lot of nights
at his house

45:48.780 --> 45:51.114
when my mom worked late,

45:51.116 --> 45:54.884
and he was like 200 pounds
when he was seven.

45:54.886 --> 45:57.854
So all his mom kept in
the house was not new--

45:59.224 --> 46:03.192
Uh... Oh, we played this game
where he'd lie on top of me,

46:03.194 --> 46:07.230
and I'd yell out things like,
"Help! You're squishing me!"

46:07.232 --> 46:09.398
Or, "I'm being crushed!"

46:09.400 --> 46:11.033
[laughs]

46:11.803 --> 46:13.803
Oh, I loved it.

46:14.906 --> 46:17.540
Oh, my God.

46:17.542 --> 46:20.042
I bet that's why
I have this re-occurring dream

46:20.044 --> 46:22.545
where I'm making love
to a Sumo wrestler.

46:22.547 --> 46:26.883
Ben, do you have
any sexual fetishes?

46:26.885 --> 46:28.317
What?

46:28.319 --> 46:31.087
Uh, sorry.
Do you hear that?

46:32.157 --> 46:33.790
No.

46:33.792 --> 46:35.291
[vocalizes]

46:35.293 --> 46:38.094
-Can I ask you a question?
-Yeah.

46:38.096 --> 46:41.063
Um, in the movie, earlier,

46:41.065 --> 46:43.833
when Annie tells Albee that
that's what her grandmother

46:43.835 --> 46:45.334
would call a real Jew?

46:45.336 --> 46:47.403
-What?
-What did she mean?

46:47.405 --> 46:50.006
It's like exemplifying all
the stereotypes of a Jew.

46:50.008 --> 46:52.208
Which are...?

46:53.511 --> 46:56.179
I'm sorry,
I don't really know
what Jewish is.

46:56.181 --> 46:59.015
I mean, I know
it's a religion,

46:59.017 --> 47:02.051
but like I went to a high school
that was 40% Hispanic

47:02.053 --> 47:03.853
and 60% Asian,
so I don't really--

47:03.855 --> 47:06.589
You still must have some,
you know, sense of--

47:06.591 --> 47:09.292
Well, what do you know
about Peruvian culture?

47:09.294 --> 47:10.927
Well, that's different,
'cause Peruvians

47:10.929 --> 47:12.895
aren't as prominent
in mainstream culture.

47:12.897 --> 47:15.131
-Mainstream?
-Look, I'm sorry.
I've been hypocritical.

47:15.133 --> 47:18.267
Okay, Jewish stereotypes--
people think that we are, uh...

47:18.269 --> 47:20.536
uh, greedy,
that we're un-athletic,

47:20.538 --> 47:22.605
that we have big noses,
we're all doctors

47:22.607 --> 47:25.141
and lawyers and accountants,
and that we run Hollywood

47:25.143 --> 47:26.576
and the media.

47:27.846 --> 47:29.579
Wow, that's a lot
of stereotypes.

47:29.581 --> 47:31.981
Yeah, well, you know,
genocides don't fuel
themselves.

47:31.983 --> 47:33.416
[both laugh]

47:34.586 --> 47:37.553
-I've never met anyone like you.
-Yeah, clearly.

47:37.555 --> 47:41.190
But honestly,
I'm a walking cliché.
You just don't know

47:41.192 --> 47:43.526
all the stuff
I'm ripping off.
Thank God.

47:43.528 --> 47:45.528
[scoffs]
You shouldn't be
so self-deprecating.

47:45.530 --> 47:47.997
I don't like it.

47:47.999 --> 47:50.099
Tell me more about
this squishing fetish.

47:50.101 --> 47:51.467
-Squish.
-I'm squishing!

47:51.469 --> 47:54.403
-Come on, come on. Ohh...
-I'm squishing!

47:56.174 --> 47:58.207
[phone vibrates]

47:58.209 --> 47:59.942
Who is blowin' up your phone?

47:59.944 --> 48:01.444
Brunch plans.

48:01.446 --> 48:03.246
My friend Stephanie
decided that she wanted

48:03.248 --> 48:06.115
to go vegan and so
it created this whole ordeal.

48:06.117 --> 48:08.084
[Lawrence]
What are you doin'?

48:08.086 --> 48:10.419
I'm posting
this BuzzFeed article

48:10.421 --> 48:13.089
about John Haam's facial
patterns to James' wall.

48:13.091 --> 48:15.958
-Uh-uh. Uh-uh.
-It's just, he's
really obsessed with him--

48:15.960 --> 48:17.593
-No!
-No.

48:17.595 --> 48:19.095
-Fine!
-Stop it.

48:19.097 --> 48:21.464
Fine!
[groans]

48:21.466 --> 48:22.899
Stop.

48:22.901 --> 48:25.101
I just miss talking
to him.

48:25.103 --> 48:27.670
I know, boo boo.

48:27.672 --> 48:30.406
I did sign up
for Tinder though.

48:31.276 --> 48:33.342
-Yes!
-[Rachel] What?

48:33.344 --> 48:35.011
-Yeah. See.
-[Lawrence] Let me see.

48:35.013 --> 48:38.147
-Wait. What?
-[Lawrence] Yes.

48:38.149 --> 48:40.616
Ooh. Your boobs
look good in these.

48:40.618 --> 48:43.552
-[Lawrence laughs]
-Yeah, I've been
messaging this guy Otis.

48:43.554 --> 48:45.354
I don't think
I'm ready to meet up,

48:45.356 --> 48:48.925
but I really do like
this constant validation thing.

48:48.927 --> 48:51.594
-[Rachel] He's hot!
-[Mel] Mmm.

48:51.596 --> 48:53.696
Oh, my God,
and he has such a cute dog.

48:53.698 --> 48:55.331
You have to meet up
with him.

48:55.333 --> 48:58.067
I'm just-- I'm--
I'm not ready for that.

48:58.069 --> 49:00.403
You know, just--

49:00.405 --> 49:01.570
I can't.

49:01.572 --> 49:03.706
Pity parties
block blessings.

49:03.708 --> 49:05.608
[scoffs]

49:05.610 --> 49:07.076
Oh, my God.

49:07.078 --> 49:08.577
That just reminds me,
I have to meet up

49:08.579 --> 49:10.646
-with Dustin in about an hour.
-Seriously?

49:10.648 --> 49:13.182
Well, do you wanna join?

49:14.185 --> 49:16.652
I'm all set. Thanks!

49:16.654 --> 49:18.087
[sighs]

49:18.089 --> 49:19.221
Do you mind
if I just...

49:19.223 --> 49:20.623
-sleep here?
-No.

49:20.625 --> 49:22.425
You can make yourself
at home.

49:22.427 --> 49:25.494
Thanks. I think
I just need some rest.

49:26.998 --> 49:29.165
[piano music playing]

49:40.011 --> 49:41.544
[phone vibrates]

49:49.754 --> 49:51.187
[sniffs]

49:55.426 --> 49:57.693
I'm really glad
we did this.

49:57.695 --> 49:59.228
Yeah. Uh.

49:59.230 --> 50:01.297
Well, you promised
me dumplings, so...

50:01.299 --> 50:03.099
-[laughs]
-[glasses clink]

50:03.101 --> 50:04.567
So you were saying that

50:04.569 --> 50:08.004
you just got out
of a long relationship?

50:08.006 --> 50:09.739
Yeah, a few months ago.

50:09.741 --> 50:12.174
Dated for a little
over five years.

50:12.176 --> 50:13.542
Wow, why'd you break up?

50:13.544 --> 50:15.444
Wow, I'm-- I'm sorry.

50:15.446 --> 50:18.514
-I know that was just way too--
-No. No, no, no. It's okay.

50:18.516 --> 50:21.217
In fact, uh,
let me get her.

50:23.054 --> 50:25.388
This is Ella.

50:26.024 --> 50:28.024
-Hi.
-Hi.

50:29.127 --> 50:32.461
Uh, so why didn't
you two work out?

50:32.463 --> 50:34.330
Oh, it was nothing major really.

50:34.332 --> 50:37.366
Our interests just kind of
shifted part over the years,

50:37.368 --> 50:40.036
and eventually,
it was our 5th anniversary,

50:40.038 --> 50:43.305
and I began to wonder if
I could really do another five.

50:43.307 --> 50:44.807
And that I fucked his brother.

50:44.809 --> 50:47.777
I would argue
what mostly the brother thing.

50:48.446 --> 50:50.046
I like your dress.

50:50.048 --> 50:51.714
Thanks.
You look really pretty.

50:51.716 --> 50:54.183
Really? 'Cause when
I first saw you,

50:54.185 --> 50:56.552
-I was just like--
-Okay!

50:56.554 --> 50:58.287
[Otis laughs]

51:00.491 --> 51:02.591
Can I ask you a question,
Melissa?

51:02.593 --> 51:04.794
Uh, yeah.

51:08.066 --> 51:09.632
Are you happy?

51:10.368 --> 51:12.201
Yeah, if I don't think

51:12.203 --> 51:14.170
about my life or where
I am too much,

51:14.172 --> 51:15.571
I'm pretty happy.

51:15.573 --> 51:17.139
-That's good.
-How about you?

51:17.141 --> 51:18.407
It's good to be happy.

51:18.409 --> 51:19.809
[mumbles]

51:19.811 --> 51:21.377
Uh-- Okay.

51:21.379 --> 51:24.080
Maybe not on the first date.

51:24.082 --> 51:25.347
Maybe.

51:25.349 --> 51:27.083
I like you a lot, Melissa.

51:27.085 --> 51:30.453
-A lot.
-And I had a good time too.

51:30.455 --> 51:31.854
I just--

51:32.790 --> 51:34.857
Okay, s-- I just--
Please stop.

51:34.859 --> 51:36.859
Okay. Okay.

51:38.096 --> 51:39.829
Just, uh...

51:39.831 --> 51:42.131
gettin' a lot
of mixed signals.

51:42.133 --> 51:46.135
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to give you mixed signals.

51:46.137 --> 51:50.506
Um, I just got out
of a long relationship too.

51:50.508 --> 51:53.109
It's really--
It's complicated.

51:53.111 --> 51:54.543
We're working it out.

51:54.545 --> 51:57.746
So don't you want
to have a little fun now?

51:57.748 --> 52:03.119
[chuckles]
I do. And I was having fun.

52:03.688 --> 52:05.521
Just a little...

52:06.124 --> 52:07.756
Ah! Oh!

52:07.758 --> 52:09.825
-Fuck!
-Are you okay?

52:09.827 --> 52:11.827
-Ah...
-Oh!

52:11.829 --> 52:13.696
-[groans]
-Oh!

52:14.899 --> 52:17.133
It's fine. It's fine.

52:17.135 --> 52:19.201
We're going out again, right?

52:21.139 --> 52:22.738
[keys jingling]

52:27.879 --> 52:29.345
Hello?

52:30.715 --> 52:32.648
James?

52:33.851 --> 52:36.152
I'm home...

52:38.656 --> 52:40.289
Home.

52:50.835 --> 52:52.434
Mel?

52:53.404 --> 52:55.171
Mel, what are you doing here?

52:56.174 --> 52:58.374
You, uh...

52:59.477 --> 53:01.844
got rid of some stuff.
[chuckles]

53:01.846 --> 53:04.180
There's a butterfly.

53:04.182 --> 53:05.648
Is everything all right?

53:08.886 --> 53:10.953
I wanna end the break.
[laughs]

53:10.955 --> 53:14.190
-Mel, you're drunk.
-No, stop it!

53:14.192 --> 53:16.525
-Mel--
-Listen.

53:16.527 --> 53:18.527
-Listening?
-Mm-hmm.

53:18.529 --> 53:20.663
Okay. Are you awake?
[slapping his face]

53:20.665 --> 53:22.698
Yeah, I'm awake.

53:25.203 --> 53:26.368
Yeah.

53:27.238 --> 53:29.471
-I was scared.
-Mm-hmm.

53:29.473 --> 53:31.974
-But now I'm not.
-Okay.

53:31.976 --> 53:34.210
And I'm ready to love you,

53:34.212 --> 53:35.844
if you'll just love me.

53:35.846 --> 53:37.213
No, listen, I have--

53:37.215 --> 53:38.647
Is everything--

53:39.684 --> 53:41.450
[sighs]

53:41.452 --> 53:42.785
Oh.

53:43.988 --> 53:46.922
-Hi, I'm Jess.
-I know who you are, Jess...

53:46.924 --> 53:48.457
Wiggins.

53:49.594 --> 53:51.827
I really like
your comedy videos.

53:51.829 --> 53:56.465
-I always watch them when--
-Well, don't. They're private.

53:56.467 --> 53:58.000
What is wrong with you?

53:58.002 --> 54:00.336
It hasn't even been a week.

54:01.305 --> 54:03.005
What are you
talkin' about, Mel?

54:03.007 --> 54:04.974
We're on a break,
all right.

54:04.976 --> 54:06.508
That was your choice.

54:06.510 --> 54:08.677
The only one
you've ever made.

54:09.247 --> 54:10.446
[scoffs]

54:10.448 --> 54:12.548
What does that mean?

54:12.550 --> 54:14.383
We moved in together

54:14.385 --> 54:17.453
because I thought
it'd be a good idea.

54:18.389 --> 54:20.322
We chose this place

54:20.324 --> 54:23.759
because you couldn't pick
between the K-Town one

54:23.761 --> 54:25.027
and this one,

54:25.029 --> 54:27.930
and you made me pick.

54:27.932 --> 54:32.334
Every night, I tripped up
in out dark bedroom

54:32.336 --> 54:35.671
because you couldn't decide
on a fucking lamp.

54:36.841 --> 54:39.275
You've gotten plenty
of job opportunities

54:39.277 --> 54:43.979
-that you've turned down--
-I like driving for Swyft.

54:43.981 --> 54:46.048
Okay? It allows
my schedule

54:46.050 --> 54:47.816
-to be flexible.
-Flexible.

54:47.818 --> 54:49.918
Yeah, yeah.
Flexible to do what?

54:49.920 --> 54:52.288
Sit on the couch
and get stoned?

54:52.290 --> 54:54.857
Because I know you haven't
gone to one audition

54:54.859 --> 54:56.992
even though you're dying
to be an actress.

54:56.994 --> 54:59.762
I have an improv group.

54:59.764 --> 55:01.297
Ah, Mel.

55:01.299 --> 55:02.631
You only like improv

55:02.633 --> 55:04.333
because it requires
zero preparation,

55:04.335 --> 55:06.835
and you can make
that shit up as you go along.

55:07.872 --> 55:10.572
[sighs]
Oh, God.

55:13.944 --> 55:15.344
Oh, Mel.

55:15.346 --> 55:16.979
I don't want to lose you.

55:19.850 --> 55:21.717
Not wanting to lose me

55:21.719 --> 55:25.087
is not the same thing
as wanting to be with me.

55:31.662 --> 55:32.895
Fine.

55:34.899 --> 55:36.999
[music playing]

56:02.093 --> 56:03.859
[Mel]
<i> James and I went</i>

56:03.861 --> 56:06.729
<i> to private school together</i>
<i> on the east coast.</i>

56:06.731 --> 56:08.731
<i> But we weren't</i>
<i> really very close.</i>

56:08.733 --> 56:11.133
<i> And after graduation,</i>
<i> we went to different schools,</i>

56:11.135 --> 56:13.736
<i> and I never really</i>
<i> heard from him.</i>

56:13.738 --> 56:16.372
<i> He was one of those guys</i>
<i> that I Facebook stalked</i>

56:16.374 --> 56:17.506
<i> a little bit.</i>

56:17.508 --> 56:18.941
<i> And it was harmless.</i>

56:18.943 --> 56:20.642
<i> And then a few months ago,</i>

56:20.644 --> 56:24.046
<i> I moved to L.A.</i>
<i> 'with my boyfriend Carl.</i>

56:24.048 --> 56:26.949
<i> We took our photo</i>
<i> by Santa Monica Beach,</i>

56:26.951 --> 56:30.018
<i> and we captioned it,</i>
<i> "Just moved."</i>

56:30.020 --> 56:32.888
<i> And we got</i>
<i> a message from James.</i>

56:33.891 --> 56:36.892
<i> He said he wanted</i>
<i> to catch up.</i>

56:38.129 --> 56:41.397
And I ignored it
for a little bit.

56:41.399 --> 56:43.399
I don't know why.

56:45.403 --> 56:47.803
Maybe I knew what would happen.

56:52.777 --> 56:55.411
From the moment that we met up,

56:55.413 --> 56:58.414
we just had this chemistry.

57:00.418 --> 57:03.585
And God, all my anxiety

57:03.587 --> 57:05.053
and my nerves about the move,

57:05.055 --> 57:07.489
and about Carl
and about my job situation

57:07.491 --> 57:10.125
just melted away and I felt

57:10.127 --> 57:13.061
like I was back
in high school again.

57:15.733 --> 57:20.469
But, that didn't last very long

57:20.471 --> 57:23.505
because now I am lying to Carl,

57:23.507 --> 57:26.675
I can't sleep, I can't eat.

57:26.677 --> 57:28.444
I feel fine. Seriously.

57:28.446 --> 57:31.079
When I think about it,
it was a long time a comin'.

57:31.081 --> 57:32.781
I'm just grateful
it happened now

57:32.783 --> 57:35.451
as opposed to 20 years
down the line.

57:35.453 --> 57:37.052
James is an asshole.

57:37.054 --> 57:39.721
You need to take that sex tape
and post it on Twitter

57:39.723 --> 57:42.958
so everyone can see
his tiny dick.

57:42.960 --> 57:45.494
It's hardly a sex tape.
It's more like a GIF.

57:45.496 --> 57:47.229
I'm not angry at James.

57:47.231 --> 57:50.466
Know what, I feel, for
the first time in a long time,

57:50.468 --> 57:53.202
I feel... unburdened.

57:53.204 --> 57:55.971
Okay, you're clearly having
some kind of psychotic rage.

57:55.973 --> 57:57.539
No. Hi.

57:57.541 --> 58:00.175
-[waiter] Hi.
-Mmm. You have lovely eyes.

58:00.177 --> 58:02.478
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

58:02.480 --> 58:04.913
-What's your name?
-Uh, Marco.

58:04.915 --> 58:06.849
Oh, wow.

58:06.851 --> 58:08.484
That's a great name.

58:08.486 --> 58:09.985
-Thank you. Thank you.
-[Marco] Enjoy.

58:09.987 --> 58:12.154
-All right, thank you.
-[Mel] Hmm.

58:12.156 --> 58:14.490
Yeah, you've been talkin'
to this guy for a year now,

58:14.492 --> 58:16.725
-and I'm the psychotic one?
-I know.

58:18.496 --> 58:20.128
What's worst case scenario?

58:20.130 --> 58:23.031
He's not what you hyped him
up to be, and her rejects you?

58:23.033 --> 58:25.801
No, worst case scenario
is exactly what I've imagined,

58:25.803 --> 58:30.506
and we fall in love
and it still doesn't
make me happy.

58:30.508 --> 58:33.075
Hey, I just wanna come by
and wish you a good show.

58:33.077 --> 58:34.743
Uh, this is Spike,
by the way.

58:34.745 --> 58:35.978
I'm not sure
if you two have met.

58:35.980 --> 58:37.579
Hi. Yeah, we met
a while ago.

58:37.581 --> 58:39.648
-As Gordo's party.
-I don't think so.

58:39.650 --> 58:42.551
-Okay.
-But hey, you know,
have a good show.

58:42.553 --> 58:45.187
The whole team is excited
to see what you got.

58:45.189 --> 58:49.625
Well, I hope
I can show you what I got
if you know what I'm sayin'.

58:50.628 --> 58:52.728
Right. Funny.

58:52.730 --> 58:54.196
Thanks.

58:54.198 --> 58:56.164
Okay then.

58:56.166 --> 58:58.133
Good luck. Okay.

59:00.070 --> 59:01.803
So there's a guy
at every improv show

59:01.805 --> 59:03.672
that laughs way too
hard at everything

59:03.674 --> 59:05.307
just to prove
that he like gets it.

59:05.309 --> 59:07.209
And I'm betting on that guy.

59:07.211 --> 59:09.011
[Gabriela]
I'm excited.

59:09.013 --> 59:10.779
I've never been to
an improv show before.

59:10.781 --> 59:13.048
Is it like<i> Wild and Out</i>
<i> with Nick Cannon?</i>

59:13.050 --> 59:15.117
It's exactly
like<i> Wild and Out</i>
<i> with Nick Cannon.</i>

59:15.119 --> 59:16.652
I think he's actually
gonna be here tonight.

59:16.654 --> 59:18.320
-Really?
-No.

59:19.890 --> 59:21.023
Mmm.

59:21.025 --> 59:22.291
Hey there.

59:22.293 --> 59:23.692
Hi.

59:23.694 --> 59:25.027
Hi. Um, I'm Rachel.

59:25.029 --> 59:27.763
-Oh, Gabriela.
-Nice to meet you.

59:27.765 --> 59:30.766
How's, uh--
How's Mel doin'?

59:31.335 --> 59:33.335
She's doin' fine.

59:33.337 --> 59:34.803
[dry chuckle]

59:34.805 --> 59:38.173
So, um, uh, Gabby,
what do you do?

59:38.175 --> 59:40.275
Uh, Gabriela.
And I work the mall.

59:40.277 --> 59:41.910
Oh! I got
my first hand-job at the mall.

59:41.912 --> 59:44.012
Oh, me too! Well, a movie
theater at the mall,

59:44.014 --> 59:46.815
but who didn't get turned on
during<i> Ratatouille.</i>

59:46.817 --> 59:48.917
[laughs] I like you.

59:48.919 --> 59:51.620
Well, I'm sorry, ma'am,
but it looks like

59:51.622 --> 59:53.789
our only recourse
is to send you

59:53.791 --> 59:56.625
on a one-way trip
to Africa.

59:56.627 --> 1:00:00.996
[laughs]
Oh, man.

1:00:00.998 --> 1:00:03.365
I flew Dinosaur Airlines.

1:00:03.367 --> 1:00:04.933
[laughs]

1:00:04.935 --> 1:00:08.103
Hello, and welcome
to Dinosaur Airlines.

1:00:08.105 --> 1:00:11.840
This is your pilot,
uh, Captain Velociraptor
speaking.

1:00:11.842 --> 1:00:14.242
[makes high-pitched
squawk sound]

1:00:14.244 --> 1:00:17.279
And this is our
beautiful stewardess.

1:00:17.915 --> 1:00:20.282
Hi. I'm...

1:00:20.284 --> 1:00:21.984
[dramatic music playing]

[small grunt]

1:00:44.908 --> 1:00:47.009

1:00:51.815 --> 1:00:54.683
I can't believe
I'm in Pizza Hat.

1:00:54.685 --> 1:00:56.251
You blew us away.

1:00:56.253 --> 1:01:00.188
I mean, that crying bit
was hilariously pathetic.

1:01:00.190 --> 1:01:03.925
I don't-- I don't give
compliments either,
you know, so...

1:01:03.927 --> 1:01:07.262
clear your Mondays,
Tuesdays, Thursdays
for rehearsal,

1:01:07.264 --> 1:01:08.997
and then go ahead
and clear your Friday,

1:01:08.999 --> 1:01:11.433
Saturday for performance,
and we're good to go.

1:01:11.435 --> 1:01:13.402
Oh. Great.

1:01:13.404 --> 1:01:14.803
Great.

1:01:14.805 --> 1:01:18.106
Hey, Mel.
Great show, I think.

1:01:18.108 --> 1:01:20.375
-[Mel chuckles]
-Uh, uh, this is Gabriela.

1:01:20.377 --> 1:01:22.144
-Hi, Gabriela!
-Hi. Hey.

1:01:22.146 --> 1:01:23.845
-Thank you so much for coming.
-Yes.

1:01:23.847 --> 1:01:25.814
-It's nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too.

1:01:25.816 --> 1:01:28.450
-You're a really pretty crier.
-Thank you!

1:01:28.452 --> 1:01:30.118
Hey. Dustin.

1:01:31.922 --> 1:01:33.789
It's an honor. Uh, Ben.

1:01:33.791 --> 1:01:35.290
[clears throat]

1:01:35.292 --> 1:01:38.393
[Mel]<i> 30 people</i>
<i> RSVP'd yes to this.</i>

1:01:38.395 --> 1:01:41.363
Well, it like
never really happened.

1:01:41.365 --> 1:01:43.932
Can we head out soon?
Maybe we'll watch

1:01:43.934 --> 1:01:47.102
one of your serial killer
episodes or something.

1:01:47.104 --> 1:01:49.271
Spike and the rest
of the team are heading

1:01:49.273 --> 1:01:51.273
to The Thirsty Crawl.
Let's just grab one drink

1:01:51.275 --> 1:01:53.041
and then we can go home.

1:01:54.712 --> 1:01:56.344
[chattering]

1:01:57.715 --> 1:01:59.347
I'm tired.

1:01:59.349 --> 1:02:01.316
I-- I don't wanna--

1:02:01.318 --> 1:02:02.918
Richard?

1:02:03.854 --> 1:02:06.221
Uh, Rachel.
Hey there.

1:02:07.725 --> 1:02:09.124
What are you doing here?

1:02:09.126 --> 1:02:12.327
Uh, my daughter told me
about this place.

1:02:13.097 --> 1:02:15.497
Improv comedy. [laughs]

1:02:15.499 --> 1:02:17.499
Very cool.

1:02:20.204 --> 1:02:22.504
[upbeat music playing]

1:02:36.887 --> 1:02:38.253
There you are...

1:02:38.255 --> 1:02:39.755
-Hey.
-Hey.

1:02:39.757 --> 1:02:41.790
You said this was
a small get together.

1:02:41.792 --> 1:02:43.992
Okay, there's barely
like a dozen people here.

1:02:43.994 --> 1:02:45.327
Yeah, but that's like
a dozen people

1:02:45.329 --> 1:02:47.129
I got to figure out
a greeting with.

1:02:47.131 --> 1:02:49.197
Handshakes? Is it high-five
all around? I don't know.

1:02:49.199 --> 1:02:51.333
Honey, don't be so nervous.
They're gonna love you.

1:02:51.335 --> 1:02:53.135
They already think
I'm your tax attorney.

1:02:53.137 --> 1:02:55.470
-What? No, they don't.
-No, well, I have a stack

1:02:55.472 --> 1:02:57.205
of your Uncle Hector's W2's
that beg to differ.

1:02:57.207 --> 1:02:59.508
Shut up. You suck.
I don't have an Uncle Hector.

1:02:59.510 --> 1:03:01.376
Come on. Come on.

1:03:02.946 --> 1:03:04.546

Nice to meet you guys.

1:03:15.793 --> 1:03:17.025
Where'd you meet
Gabriela?

1:03:17.027 --> 1:03:19.394
We met on, uh,
on Tinder, actually.

1:03:19.396 --> 1:03:20.529
-Oh!
-Yes.

1:03:20.531 --> 1:03:23.031

Okay. Let's eat.

1:03:37.948 --> 1:03:39.247
Just eat. It's good.

1:03:39.249 --> 1:03:40.448
-It is?
-Yeah.

1:03:40.450 --> 1:03:42.317
-What? It's a heart?
-Yeah.

1:03:42.319 --> 1:03:44.419

Thank you. Thanks.

[Ben]<i> So what do</i>

Hey, do you and Gabriela
ever kiss?

1:03:52.162 --> 1:03:54.830
Uh, yeah.
We do sometimes.

1:03:54.832 --> 1:03:57.465
Well, doesn't your nose
get in the way?

1:03:57.467 --> 1:04:00.035
-So what do you do?
-Oh, I'm retired.

1:04:00.037 --> 1:04:01.970
Uh, I've been retired
since '98.

1:04:01.972 --> 1:04:04.372
I was a tow truck driver
for about 40 years.

1:04:04.374 --> 1:04:06.007
Oh, wow.

1:04:06.009 --> 1:04:07.976
In tow trucks, you guys
are sort of like the,

1:04:07.978 --> 1:04:10.979
you're sort of like
the lifeguards of the road.

1:04:10.981 --> 1:04:12.447
Except you have
your shirts on.

1:04:12.449 --> 1:04:14.082
-I mean, I think, I don't know.
-[chuckles]

1:04:14.084 --> 1:04:15.450
You know, who knows
how you do it.

1:04:15.452 --> 1:04:17.485
But, uh-- Oh.
Thank you so much.

-Oh.

-Sorry, uh...
-[mother] Just a minute.

1:04:45.082 --> 1:04:46.348
No, no, Ben.
Stay in there.

-Stay in there. Yeah.

-[speaks Spanish]
-I think I'm gonna head out.

1:05:03.133 --> 1:05:04.900
-What?
-I'm just feeling really wiped,

1:05:04.902 --> 1:05:08.003
um, and I--
I totally forgot
I have this article

1:05:08.005 --> 1:05:10.005
that I have to send in
to, uh, the site tomorrow.

1:05:10.007 --> 1:05:12.908
Oh, okay. Well, I-I--
I'll walk you to your car.

1:05:12.910 --> 1:05:14.276
You sure? I don't
want to, you know,

1:05:14.278 --> 1:05:15.310
take away the birthday girl.

1:05:15.312 --> 1:05:16.411
No, that's fine.

1:05:16.413 --> 1:05:18.513
-Um, I'll be right back.
-Okay.

1:05:20.250 --> 1:05:21.983
You didn't have to come.

1:05:21.985 --> 1:05:24.653
No, I wanted to come.
Really, I had a good time.

1:05:24.655 --> 1:05:26.221
I'm just--
I'm just tired.

1:05:26.223 --> 1:05:28.990
Okay. I just--
I thought you were sleep

1:05:28.992 --> 1:05:30.258
at my place for once.

1:05:30.260 --> 1:05:32.193
Oh, I'm just--
I'm wiped, babe.

1:05:32.195 --> 1:05:34.329
I-I, uh-- It seemed like
the party was going to go on

1:05:34.331 --> 1:05:36.598
for a little while longer.
Uh, I'll stay over soon.

1:05:36.600 --> 1:05:39.000
Okay. When?

1:05:39.002 --> 1:05:41.136
Uh, I don't know.
Uh, I'll text you.

1:05:41.138 --> 1:05:42.604
We can figure it out.

1:05:42.606 --> 1:05:44.306
You know I hate
when you do that.

1:05:44.308 --> 1:05:46.942
-When I do what?
-"We'll figure it out."

1:05:46.944 --> 1:05:49.411
What's wrong with that?
Why can't we just figure it out?

1:05:49.413 --> 1:05:53.081
Because when you say that,
it makes me feel like you
don't want to see me at all.

1:05:53.083 --> 1:05:55.951
No, I just don't always like
to make definitive plans.

1:05:55.953 --> 1:05:57.953
Why can't we just be casual?

1:05:57.955 --> 1:06:00.555
Casual? I don't-- What--

1:06:00.557 --> 1:06:02.991
I'm not someone who just
sleeps around with whoever.

1:06:02.993 --> 1:06:04.726
I know. I'm just--

1:06:04.728 --> 1:06:07.629
Do you really think
that we're that compatible?

1:06:07.631 --> 1:06:10.131
You said
you liked our differences.

1:06:10.133 --> 1:06:12.000
I do. We're just
very different.

1:06:12.002 --> 1:06:13.702
I mean, I'm going home
next month for Yom Kippur.

1:06:13.704 --> 1:06:15.403
You probably
don't even know
what that is.

1:06:15.405 --> 1:06:17.706
Yes, I do.
It's the little hats you wear.

1:06:17.708 --> 1:06:20.442
We just have different lives.
We have different references.

1:06:20.444 --> 1:06:22.043
And that's fine, you know.
It's not--

1:06:22.045 --> 1:06:24.646
I'm sorry.
I don't know
all the movies you love.

1:06:24.648 --> 1:06:26.648
I'm sorry that
I work at the mall

1:06:26.650 --> 1:06:29.217
and not some hip
branded content, whatever.

1:06:29.219 --> 1:06:31.586
I'm sorry my parents
couldn't co-sign on a lease.

1:06:31.588 --> 1:06:33.121
Gabriela, that is
not what this is about.

1:06:33.123 --> 1:06:35.690
Then what is it about, Ben?
Tell me.

1:06:37.327 --> 1:06:39.728
In like a month, you're going
to get into law school.

1:06:39.730 --> 1:06:42.263
And we're gonna act
like it's fine,

1:06:42.265 --> 1:06:44.199
and try to play it cool,
but eventually,

1:06:44.201 --> 1:06:46.735
you're gonna meet somebody,
or get back with your ex,

1:06:46.737 --> 1:06:49.471
and I'm just gonna be some story
about some funny Jewish guy

1:06:49.473 --> 1:06:52.374
you dated once,
and that's fine.

1:06:52.376 --> 1:06:54.642
You're probably too nice
for me, anyway.

1:06:54.644 --> 1:06:56.678
But, I don't know,
why waste our time

1:06:56.680 --> 1:06:58.446
gettin' to the inevitable?

1:07:00.751 --> 1:07:02.684
Gabriela, listen, I--

1:07:02.686 --> 1:07:05.153
No, I know you think that just
because you're so self-aware,

1:07:05.155 --> 1:07:07.022
it makes what you say less mean,

1:07:07.024 --> 1:07:08.757
but it doesn't.

1:07:15.599 --> 1:07:17.232
It's been a rough few months,

1:07:17.234 --> 1:07:19.734
but I think
I'm finally over James.

1:19:01.738 --> 1:19:04.805
'cause, um...

1:19:05.975 --> 1:19:08.943
I think you're
an amazing person, Gabriela.

1:19:10.012 --> 1:19:13.447
I'm really sorry,
uh, and I hope

1:19:13.449 --> 1:19:15.883
you can forgive me
for not knowing

1:19:15.885 --> 1:19:17.485
what was real in the moment.

1:19:20.156 --> 1:19:21.455
Yeah.

1:19:22.258 --> 1:19:23.524
I can forgive you.

1:19:23.526 --> 1:19:25.226
Really?

1:19:25.228 --> 1:19:27.995
Well, you made
the whole dramatic speech.

1:19:27.997 --> 1:19:29.330
[groans]
Oh, goddamn it.

1:19:29.332 --> 1:19:31.265
It was
so much better in the car.

1:19:32.935 --> 1:19:34.535
Quit it. Come on,
do you want to come in?

1:19:34.537 --> 1:19:36.470
-Yeah, that'd be great.
-Okay. Okay.

1:19:36.472 --> 1:19:37.538
I would love that.

1:19:37.540 --> 1:19:39.840
-Thanks.
-[Gabriela chuckles]

1:19:52.255 --> 1:19:54.388
[slide viewer whirring]

1:19:54.390 --> 1:19:57.258
[Mel]
<i> Is Dustin coming?</i>

1:19:57.260 --> 1:19:59.059
You know, it's fine.

1:19:59.061 --> 1:20:01.796
I'm over it.
And I just decided

1:20:01.798 --> 1:20:04.131
that I am
not going to date anyone

1:20:04.133 --> 1:20:06.567
for at least three months
because I did the math,

1:20:06.569 --> 1:20:08.302
and the longest
I've ever been single

1:20:08.304 --> 1:20:09.870
was two and a half months.

1:20:09.872 --> 1:20:11.505
That doesn't count.
You had lime disease.

1:20:11.507 --> 1:20:13.908
But I was single,
as I am now.

1:20:13.910 --> 1:20:16.577
And that's,
that's all that matters.
I feel good about it.

1:20:16.579 --> 1:20:19.380
Well, I'm really happy
for you, Rachel.

1:20:19.382 --> 1:20:22.850
Yeah. I just feel like
I need to focus on myself,

1:20:22.852 --> 1:20:24.552
I'm quitting my job.

1:20:24.554 --> 1:20:26.854
And dating
just gets in the way of it all.

1:20:26.856 --> 1:20:28.289
Richard?

1:20:29.292 --> 1:20:30.491
Rachel...

1:20:31.828 --> 1:20:33.561
When my wife left me,

1:20:33.563 --> 1:20:36.564
I felt like I had lost
the will to want

1:20:36.566 --> 1:20:39.333
anything ever again.

1:20:40.570 --> 1:20:42.903
And then I met you,

1:20:42.905 --> 1:20:46.040
and the feelings
I had scared me.

1:20:46.042 --> 1:20:48.909
I had a daughter
I had to look after,

1:20:48.911 --> 1:20:50.511
and I didn't want to hurt you,

1:20:50.513 --> 1:20:53.581
and that's why
I stopped calling.

1:20:53.583 --> 1:20:55.382
Oh, I actually stopped
calling you.

1:20:55.384 --> 1:20:57.084
Rachel,
I've been asked to join

1:20:57.086 --> 1:20:58.953
some of the top chiropractors
in the world

1:20:58.955 --> 1:21:01.555
at a conference in Barcelona.
Come with me.

1:21:01.557 --> 1:21:04.024
You want to take me
to Barcelona?

1:21:04.026 --> 1:21:05.593
Flight leaves in two hours.

1:21:05.595 --> 1:21:07.261
Oh, my God.

1:21:07.263 --> 1:21:08.529
Wow, this is happening so fast.

1:21:08.531 --> 1:21:10.030
I-I need to pack.

1:21:10.032 --> 1:21:11.966
We'll buy you new clothes
when we get there.

1:21:11.968 --> 1:21:13.133
Okay.

1:21:13.135 --> 1:21:16.036
-Yes, yes, yes.
-[Mel vocalizes]

1:21:16.038 --> 1:21:17.872
-Oh, my God.
-Come on, we got to go.

1:21:17.874 --> 1:21:20.341
-Okay.
-Rachel, are you sure
you want to do this?

1:21:20.343 --> 1:21:23.143
Oh, I have never been more sure
about anything in my life.

1:21:24.614 --> 1:21:26.080
Uh...

1:21:26.082 --> 1:21:27.648
Uh, Melissa, right?

1:21:27.650 --> 1:21:31.352
-What? Yeah.
-I'm, uh, I'm Wes.

1:21:31.354 --> 1:21:33.921
I'm the director
of communications
for Swyft corporate.

1:21:33.923 --> 1:21:35.522
Look, I've been following
your customer reviews.

1:21:35.524 --> 1:21:37.124
You seem to really have
a way with people.

1:21:37.126 --> 1:21:38.659
Um, I'm sorry,
I'm confused.

1:21:38.661 --> 1:21:40.961
Are you--
Are you buying
one of my zoetropes?

1:21:40.963 --> 1:21:43.664
No. We're looking for someone
to work in the office.

1:21:43.666 --> 1:21:45.399
In customer service.

1:21:45.401 --> 1:21:47.067
-Oh.
-It's a 9-to-5.

1:21:47.069 --> 1:21:49.937
But we have benefits,
if you're interested.

1:21:56.646 --> 1:21:58.112
Did I miss it?

1:21:59.482 --> 1:22:02.249
[James] You keep this room
cleaner than we did ours.

1:22:03.920 --> 1:22:06.553
I was not that messy.

1:22:06.555 --> 1:22:09.056
[laughs]
Yeah, you were.

1:22:11.661 --> 1:22:13.160
I just...

1:22:13.162 --> 1:22:15.129
I can't believe
you guys broke up.

1:22:15.698 --> 1:22:17.264
You seemed so happy.

1:22:17.266 --> 1:22:19.366
According to Facebook,
you guys were,

1:22:19.368 --> 1:22:22.569
you know, on the beach,
kissing at sunset,

1:22:22.571 --> 1:22:23.971
at least once a week.

1:22:23.973 --> 1:22:25.706
[groans]
How else do you expect

1:22:25.708 --> 1:22:28.609
her old sorority sisters to know
that she was happier than them?

1:22:28.611 --> 1:22:31.278
-[chuckles]
-So what happened?

1:22:33.482 --> 1:22:35.249
Well, we just...

1:22:37.186 --> 1:22:39.954
We realized we didn't have
anything in common, really.

1:22:39.956 --> 1:22:42.156
[scoffs]
What are you talking about?

1:22:42.158 --> 1:22:43.590
You guys grew up together.

1:22:43.592 --> 1:22:47.094
Yeah, I mean,
reminiscing about the past

1:22:47.096 --> 1:22:49.663
was fun and all, and...

1:22:49.665 --> 1:22:52.666
You know, she left
her fiancé, and...

1:22:52.668 --> 1:22:55.703
that was riveting
for a little bit,

1:22:55.705 --> 1:22:58.439
but then,
you know, we realized

1:22:58.441 --> 1:23:00.207
we didn't know each
other at all.

1:23:01.344 --> 1:23:04.478
You know, we had this idea
of one another,

1:23:04.480 --> 1:23:09.316
and this idea
from back in high school,

1:23:09.318 --> 1:23:11.251
but...

1:23:11.253 --> 1:23:13.287
Yeah, it was, it was nothing.

1:23:16.625 --> 1:23:19.259
-I'm sorry to hear that.
-[kisses]

1:23:23.432 --> 1:23:24.698
Don't be.

1:23:31.040 --> 1:23:33.140
Okay, okay.

1:23:33.142 --> 1:23:35.342
Calm down. [laughs]

1:23:36.445 --> 1:23:38.278
And...

1:23:38.280 --> 1:23:42.016
there's someone coming over
in a few hours, and...

1:23:42.018 --> 1:23:45.786
I need to do some work
and get ready.

1:23:47.323 --> 1:23:49.356
Yeah. Okay.

1:23:50.126 --> 1:23:51.492
All right, I'm...

1:23:51.494 --> 1:23:54.194
I'm really glad
to see you, and...

1:23:54.196 --> 1:23:57.364
I don't regret
that this happened.

1:23:57.800 --> 1:24:00.267
Yeah, well...

1:24:01.404 --> 1:24:03.637
we'll probably
regret it tomorrow, but...

1:24:08.744 --> 1:24:10.744
-[chuckles]
-But who knows?

1:24:10.746 --> 1:24:12.579
Maybe later...

1:24:13.315 --> 1:24:15.682
it won't even matter.

1:24:15.684 --> 1:24:18.085
Hey, can I ask
you a question?

1:24:19.789 --> 1:24:22.489
Yeah.
What's up?

1:24:24.727 --> 1:24:26.627
Why did you propose?

1:24:32.668 --> 1:24:34.268
I don't know.

1:24:35.204 --> 1:24:37.171
I guess I just...

1:24:38.507 --> 1:24:41.108
I wanted to make
a decision about something.

1:24:42.378 --> 1:24:45.212
I wanted something in
my life to be definite.

1:24:45.848 --> 1:24:47.681
[quietly]
Okay.

1:24:49.285 --> 1:24:51.852
-Melissa.
-Wayne!

1:24:54.824 --> 1:24:56.690
Yeah, I have the...

1:24:56.692 --> 1:24:59.259
Oh, you have no idea how long
I've been looking for this.

1:24:59.261 --> 1:25:00.828
[chuckles]
Cool.

1:25:00.830 --> 1:25:01.862
Well, have...

1:25:01.864 --> 1:25:04.164
Well, uh, thanks!

1:25:04.834 --> 1:25:06.633
Yeah.

1:25:06.635 --> 1:25:07.835
[grunts]

1:25:30.826 --> 1:25:32.392
Fuck.

1:25:33.162 --> 1:25:35.129
It's not the right one.

1:25:36.365 --> 1:25:38.398
So there was
no chiropractic convention

1:25:38.400 --> 1:25:39.800
in Barcelona.

1:25:39.802 --> 1:25:41.301
I got into Richards car,

1:25:41.303 --> 1:25:43.337
had a glass
of celebratory champagne

1:25:43.339 --> 1:25:44.838
that he insisted on,

1:25:44.840 --> 1:25:46.373
and then...

1:25:46.375 --> 1:25:47.541
nothing.

1:25:47.543 --> 1:25:50.777
On the night
of September 22nd, 2016,

1:25:50.779 --> 1:25:53.247
at approximately 7:23 p.m.,

1:25:53.249 --> 1:25:55.782
I pulled over
a black Mercedes sedan

1:25:55.784 --> 1:25:58.519
on the corner
of Fountain and Normandie,

1:25:58.521 --> 1:26:00.888
because I believed
the driver to be texting

1:26:00.890 --> 1:26:02.389
while driving.

1:26:02.391 --> 1:26:05.192
The driver,
one Richard Kaplan,

1:26:05.194 --> 1:26:07.294
gives his license
and registration,

1:26:07.296 --> 1:26:09.196
and I was about to let
him off with a warning,

1:26:09.198 --> 1:26:11.732
when I noticed
a persistent buzzing

1:26:11.734 --> 1:26:13.834
coming from the trunk
of the vehicle.

1:26:13.836 --> 1:26:16.336
Upon opening the trunk,
I discovered

1:26:16.338 --> 1:26:17.938
Miss Strauss, unconscious.

1:26:17.940 --> 1:26:20.741
The buzzing was coming
from her phone in her pocket.

1:26:20.743 --> 1:26:23.610
If it had not been
for several women texting her

1:26:23.612 --> 1:26:25.779
regarding brunch plans
for the following day,

1:26:25.781 --> 1:26:28.282
I'm afraid we never would've
found Miss Strauss.

1:26:28.284 --> 1:26:31.251
And we never would've
apprehended Mr. Kaplan,

1:26:31.253 --> 1:26:34.721
who you may know
as the Tindernapper.

1:26:34.723 --> 1:26:36.256
The Tindernapper.

1:26:36.258 --> 1:26:37.758
That's what they came up with.

1:26:37.760 --> 1:26:39.826
It was clever,
but a little inaccurate,

1:26:39.828 --> 1:26:43.263
since we met on
an entirely different app.

1:26:43.265 --> 1:26:45.199
But it was a good headline.

1:26:45.201 --> 1:26:47.968
And for a while,
I was kind of famous.

1:26:47.970 --> 1:26:51.638
I wrote the most viewed
editorial HuffPo history

1:26:51.640 --> 1:26:53.407
<i> about the experience.</i>

1:26:53.409 --> 1:26:55.209
I had to elaborate a little,

1:26:55.211 --> 1:26:58.278
because essentially, I got
into a car and took a nap,

1:26:58.280 --> 1:27:00.914
but I sold
the rights to my story to Hulu,

1:27:00.916 --> 1:27:02.349
and with the money,

1:27:02.351 --> 1:27:03.784
I finally quit my job

1:27:03.786 --> 1:27:06.220
and bought a one-way ticket
to Barcelona.

1:27:06.956 --> 1:27:08.722
I just felt like
I didn't need

1:27:08.724 --> 1:27:11.925
to wait
for a relationship to go.

1:27:11.927 --> 1:27:13.794
I should just go.

1:27:13.796 --> 1:27:15.229
So I went.

1:27:15.231 --> 1:27:16.863
And it was amazing.

1:27:16.865 --> 1:27:18.732
For four days.

1:27:18.734 --> 1:27:20.400
Then I got lonely,

1:27:20.402 --> 1:27:24.605
and I ended up signing up
an online dating app

1:27:24.607 --> 1:27:27.841
for Americans
who were staying abroad.

1:27:27.843 --> 1:27:29.743
-And I ma--
-We matched again.

1:27:29.745 --> 1:27:31.345
[chuckles]
Hi. Todd.

1:27:31.347 --> 1:27:32.679
Um, yeah, I was just--

1:27:32.681 --> 1:27:34.581
I was randomly
also in Barcelona.

1:27:34.583 --> 1:27:37.584
I was actually there
as the international judge

1:27:37.586 --> 1:27:39.553
for a local tapas
competition,

1:27:39.555 --> 1:27:42.022
and, uh, I remember
I had just taken a break

1:27:42.024 --> 1:27:45.025
after having a particularly
delicious<i> croquette de pollo,</i>

1:27:45.027 --> 1:27:48.362
and I looked at my phone,
and I saw the message
from Rachel, and I--

1:27:48.364 --> 1:27:50.664
Why do you always have to
mention the<i> croquette de pollo</i>

1:27:50.666 --> 1:27:52.733
every time you tell the story?
Why can't you just say,

1:27:52.735 --> 1:27:56.770
"I judged a competition,
and I saw Rachel on my phone"?

1:27:56.772 --> 1:27:58.472
Oh, I'm--

1:27:58.474 --> 1:27:59.873
I'm s-- I'm so sorry,
I didn't realize

1:27:59.875 --> 1:28:01.675
you didn't like
<i> croquettes de pollo?</i>

1:28:01.677 --> 1:28:04.278
-I was--
-No. It's not
that I don't like--

1:28:05.481 --> 1:28:07.014
No. I'm sorry.

1:28:07.016 --> 1:28:09.683
I interrupted you.

1:28:09.685 --> 1:28:11.285
Continue.

1:28:12.621 --> 1:28:14.921
She's so patient with me.
[laughs]

1:28:14.923 --> 1:28:16.723
Things are great.
I'm in New York,

1:28:16.725 --> 1:28:19.026
but Ben visits a lot,
and I obviously go home a lot,

1:28:19.028 --> 1:28:20.861
so we see each other
pretty often.

1:28:20.863 --> 1:28:24.298
Yeah, with all the Skype'ing
and texting, and, uh...

1:28:24.300 --> 1:28:25.899
all that stuff,

1:28:25.901 --> 1:28:27.868
honestly, it really
hardly even feels

1:28:27.870 --> 1:28:29.903
-like a long distance
relationship.
-Ah, yeah.

1:28:29.905 --> 1:28:32.039
[female interviewer]
Do you think you're
in a relationship

1:28:32.041 --> 1:28:34.941
because of online dating
or in spite of it?

1:28:36.312 --> 1:28:38.512
I think it's kind of
a mix of the two.

1:28:38.514 --> 1:28:41.381
Uh, I used to get embarrassed
when people asked how we met.

1:28:41.383 --> 1:28:43.717
I wanted a fun,
romantic story,

1:28:43.719 --> 1:28:45.752
and Tinder didn't feel
fun or romantic,

1:28:45.754 --> 1:28:47.921
but then I started thinking
about the fact that

1:28:47.923 --> 1:28:49.956
one night,
a year and a half ago,

1:28:49.958 --> 1:28:52.959
I signed up for Tinder
at my friend Manuela's
apartment,

1:28:52.961 --> 1:28:54.728
swiped right
on the photo of Ben,

1:28:54.730 --> 1:28:57.064
who was 3.7 miles away
at his apartment,

1:28:57.066 --> 1:28:59.032
because I liked his smile,

1:28:59.034 --> 1:29:02.002
and then I started thinking,
what if Manuela had come
to my house?

1:29:02.004 --> 1:29:03.904
Or, what if I had gone
to her place,

1:29:03.906 --> 1:29:07.040
but didn't let her pressure me
into downloading the app?

1:29:07.042 --> 1:29:08.842
Or...

1:29:08.844 --> 1:29:11.011
what if Ben had picked
a different profile picture

1:29:11.013 --> 1:29:13.447
where he wasn't smiling
and I never noticed
him in the first place?

1:29:13.449 --> 1:29:16.116
Uh, I don't know, after I was
thinking all these things,

1:29:16.118 --> 1:29:19.786
suddenly, the story of how
Ben and I met felt...

1:29:20.789 --> 1:29:24.558
It's like fate
with a GPS function.

1:29:24.560 --> 1:29:26.093
-[laughs]
-Yeah. Yeah.

1:29:26.095 --> 1:29:27.894
Yeah, right?
Something like that.

1:29:27.896 --> 1:29:32.799
Bumble, Tinder,
Grindr, Scruff, whatever.

1:29:32.801 --> 1:29:34.534
I think
they're great and all,

1:29:34.536 --> 1:29:37.137
but me, I'd rather meet guys
the old fashioned way.

1:29:37.139 --> 1:29:39.740
Like Lawrence,
for instance.

1:29:39.742 --> 1:29:42.509
He was this cute boy
who will just come in

1:29:42.511 --> 1:29:44.111
to my restaurant,
and one day,

1:29:44.113 --> 1:29:46.079
I got the courage
to ask him out.

1:29:46.081 --> 1:29:48.115
I didn't need technology
or anything.

1:29:48.117 --> 1:29:51.017
And I think
it's better that way.

1:29:51.019 --> 1:29:52.986
Mmm. Mmm.

1:29:52.988 --> 1:29:55.956
[interviewer]
Lawrence, did you notice Marco

1:29:55.958 --> 1:29:57.824
before he asked you out?

1:29:57.826 --> 1:29:59.626
I mean...

1:29:59.628 --> 1:30:02.162
[interviewer] Did you ever give
online dating another chance?

1:30:02.164 --> 1:30:04.664
Well, I deleted it,

1:30:04.666 --> 1:30:07.434
and then I re-downloaded it,
and then I deleted it again,

1:30:07.436 --> 1:30:10.103
and then it's just kind of like
been going like that for awhile.

1:30:10.105 --> 1:30:12.072
I just felt like whenever,

1:30:12.074 --> 1:30:14.441
you know, a guy liked me,
I didn't really like him back,

1:30:14.443 --> 1:30:19.146
and, uh, if I liked a guy,
he wasn't really that into me.

1:30:19.148 --> 1:30:21.882
[interviewer]
Are you seeing anyone now?

1:30:21.884 --> 1:30:23.417
Not really.

1:30:24.420 --> 1:30:26.953
Uh, it's not that serious.

1:30:26.955 --> 1:30:30.023
I, uh, yeah,
we're, we're just,

1:30:30.025 --> 1:30:33.693
we're havin' fun,
you know, so...

1:30:34.930 --> 1:30:37.531
Uh, being single's
actually really...

1:30:37.533 --> 1:30:39.866
Awful. Firstly,
no one is getting laid

1:30:39.868 --> 1:30:41.535
as much as they say they are.

1:30:41.537 --> 1:30:42.803
[interviewer]
But you were once so intrigued

1:30:42.805 --> 1:30:44.204
by online dating, no?

1:30:44.206 --> 1:30:46.873
Yeah, I was, but...

1:30:46.875 --> 1:30:49.443
It's like when you're up
late at night

1:30:49.445 --> 1:30:51.211
and you want to watch a movie,
so you start scrolling

1:30:51.213 --> 1:30:54.481
through your Netflix,
your HBO Go,

1:30:54.483 --> 1:30:57.717
your Amazon Prime,
and there's so many options,

1:30:57.719 --> 1:31:00.654
that by the time
you make a decision,

1:31:00.656 --> 1:31:03.056
you're already too tired
to enjoy it in the first place.

1:31:03.058 --> 1:31:04.524
It's like...

1:31:04.526 --> 1:31:06.193
I'll watch
a movie for 20 minutes,

1:31:06.195 --> 1:31:08.762
and then I'll stop it,
and I'll watch another one

1:31:08.764 --> 1:31:10.497
for another 20 minutes,
and I'll do that

1:31:10.499 --> 1:31:12.632
over and over and over again,
because I figure,

1:31:12.634 --> 1:31:15.869
what's the point of watching
a movie that's just okay,

1:31:15.871 --> 1:31:18.205
when out of all these options,

1:31:18.207 --> 1:31:20.941
is my new favorite movie?

1:31:22.044 --> 1:31:24.010
So basically,

1:31:24.012 --> 1:31:26.580
all this just goes to shit
because none of us

1:31:26.582 --> 1:31:28.648
-are gonna be able to--
-[phone notification chimes]

1:31:29.918 --> 1:31:31.184
