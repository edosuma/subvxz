WEBVTT

00:00.940 --> 00:02.690
Tonight from the curse of Oak Island

00:02.690 --> 00:04.870
they're saying that the Marie

00:04.870 --> 00:06.140
Antoinette's jewels were buried in

00:06.140 --> 00:08.830
Canada it was more than just an interest

00:08.830 --> 00:12.179
in Treasury FDR found answers I think

00:12.179 --> 00:13.759
we're into something right if there's

00:13.759 --> 00:17.670
box drain it leads to the flood fun it's

00:17.670 --> 00:20.720
true that the original story is true

00:20.720 --> 00:23.880
Rick look at this Romeo this is the

00:23.880 --> 00:25.710
shaft they bound the gold I think we

00:25.710 --> 00:31.360
should dig right here x marks the spot

00:31.360 --> 00:34.789
there is an island in the North Atlantic

00:34.789 --> 00:36.559
where people have been looking for an

00:36.559 --> 00:39.879
incredible treasure for more than 200

00:39.879 --> 00:43.269
years so far they have found bits of

00:43.269 --> 00:46.859
gold chain a stone slab with strange

00:46.859 --> 00:50.289
symbols carved into it even a 17th

00:50.289 --> 00:54.100
century Spanish coin to date six men

00:54.100 --> 00:56.920
have died trying to solve the mystery

00:56.920 --> 01:01.370
and according to legend one more will

01:01.370 --> 01:20.180
have to die before the treasure can

01:20.180 --> 01:22.530
in this statement he actually says

01:22.530 --> 01:24.330
Franklin thought they were the lost

01:24.330 --> 01:28.590
jewels of louis xvi and marie antoinette

01:28.590 --> 01:31.790
so these are the lost crown jewels from

01:31.790 --> 01:32.790
france

01:32.790 --> 01:36.110
at the presidential library of Franklin

01:36.110 --> 01:39.510
Delano Roosevelt Rick lagina along with

01:39.510 --> 01:42.160
his nephew Alex and researcher Paul

01:42.160 --> 01:45.050
Troutman have just uncovered startling

01:45.050 --> 01:48.540
information concerning America's 32nd

01:48.540 --> 01:51.730
president and the 221 year search for

01:51.730 --> 01:56.000
treasure on Oak Island as a young boy

01:56.000 --> 01:58.960
growing up in upstate New York

01:58.960 --> 02:00.710
Franklin Delano Roosevelt became

02:00.710 --> 02:03.710
fascinated with the Oak Island mystery

02:03.710 --> 02:05.520
after hearing stories about it from his

02:05.520 --> 02:09.399
maternal grandfather Warren Delano jr. a

02:09.399 --> 02:11.840
maritime trader whose ancestors had

02:11.840 --> 02:14.060
reportedly come to America on the

02:14.060 --> 02:17.120
Mayflower and they're saying that Louie

02:17.120 --> 02:20.340
the 16th and Marie Antoinette when

02:20.340 --> 02:22.890
making their escape they had the jewels

02:22.890 --> 02:25.630
in a bag and a brooch she handed the

02:25.630 --> 02:27.450
jewels to a lady-in-waiting and that

02:27.450 --> 02:30.510
girl went to Canada this girl always

02:30.510 --> 02:32.200
said the jewels were buried in Mahone

02:32.200 --> 02:33.970
Bay and that's why Franklin heard the

02:33.970 --> 02:35.420
story and put some money into our

02:35.420 --> 02:39.050
expedition could finding the lost jewels

02:39.050 --> 02:41.940
of Marie Antoinette really be the key to

02:41.940 --> 02:45.210
solving the Oak Island mystery I was

02:45.210 --> 02:47.280
dumbfounded by that because that begs

02:47.280 --> 02:51.270
another question not the why of it but

02:51.270 --> 02:53.400
where was that information sources from

02:53.400 --> 02:59.480
in 1792 as the French Revolution began

02:59.480 --> 03:02.209
to enter its bloodiest phase one in

03:02.209 --> 03:04.880
Marie Antoinette's most trusted servants

03:04.880 --> 03:07.450
was ordered to smuggle the Queen's gold

03:07.450 --> 03:10.069
and jewels out of France and take them

03:10.069 --> 03:11.650
where they could be used to purchase

03:11.650 --> 03:14.209
safe passage for the royal family and

03:14.209 --> 03:16.709
members of their household

03:16.709 --> 03:19.069
unfortunately for Marie Antoinette and

03:19.069 --> 03:22.770
King Louis the sixteenth the plan failed

03:22.770 --> 03:25.890
and they were executed by guillotine in

03:25.890 --> 03:29.930
1793 although some of the crown jewels

03:29.930 --> 03:33.040
later turned up in Europe others

03:33.040 --> 03:35.599
including a portion of the 65 carat blue

03:35.599 --> 03:37.910
stone that was cut to create the

03:37.910 --> 03:40.459
infamous Hope Diamond have never been

03:40.459 --> 03:42.739
found

03:42.739 --> 03:44.910
the FDA art they was more than just he

03:44.910 --> 03:47.270
had an interest in treasure it was quite

03:47.270 --> 03:48.790
specific yeah he thought there was

03:48.790 --> 03:51.340
something actually to it well what's

03:51.340 --> 03:53.599
interesting is there's never been a

03:53.599 --> 03:57.320
connection to a real person ie the lady

03:57.320 --> 04:00.520
in waiting she comes to Kenna I've never

04:00.520 --> 04:03.520
heard or read anything about that so

04:03.520 --> 04:05.520
where did that piece of information come

04:05.520 --> 04:07.980
from well it must have been something

04:07.980 --> 04:09.190
with FDR that he had research is

04:09.190 --> 04:11.150
something that somebody told him well

04:11.150 --> 04:12.910
whatever you hear stories of

04:12.910 --> 04:15.100
specifically crown jewels and you think

04:15.100 --> 04:16.899
back to when we saw a shiny gold object

04:16.899 --> 04:20.560
in one of our digs not saying it's a

04:20.560 --> 04:22.560
guarantee but you know it's a

04:22.560 --> 04:24.650
possibility

04:24.650 --> 04:27.090
after truly an exploratory borehole in

04:27.090 --> 04:30.220
the money pit area last year here we go

04:30.220 --> 04:33.430
Rick lagina Dave Blankenship and Island

04:33.430 --> 04:35.680
historian Charles Barkhouse Eric

04:35.680 --> 04:38.560
discovered what appeared to be a shiny

04:38.560 --> 04:41.810
gold colored object embedded in bedrock

04:41.810 --> 04:45.330
some 170 feet below the surface of Oak

04:45.330 --> 04:46.330
Island

04:46.330 --> 04:50.900
it's your gold color David but after the

04:50.900 --> 04:52.980
team arranged to send world-renowned

04:52.980 --> 04:55.280
diver John Chatterton down to

04:55.280 --> 04:59.660
investigate it what's that the gold

04:59.660 --> 05:02.720
colored object was nowhere to be found

05:02.720 --> 05:04.750
even after receiving a number of earlier

05:04.750 --> 05:06.860
hits with a metal detector

05:06.860 --> 05:08.040
are you picking something up John

05:08.040 --> 05:14.550
we'll be interesting we could find who

05:14.550 --> 05:17.290
this lady was yes let's see if we can

05:17.290 --> 05:18.530
dig up more background information

05:18.530 --> 05:20.460
especially about her trip to Canada you

05:20.460 --> 05:21.620
would think if she were the

05:21.620 --> 05:23.470
lady-in-waiting and obviously a very

05:23.470 --> 05:25.350
important part of the royal court very

05:25.350 --> 05:27.940
prominent very prominent that that name

05:27.940 --> 05:29.889
would surface that name would be known

05:29.889 --> 05:30.889
yes

05:30.889 --> 05:32.670
as was usually the case you find one

05:32.670 --> 05:33.780
thing and there's more questions

05:33.780 --> 05:36.030
afterward it's a good question very

05:36.030 --> 05:37.449
interesting clue yeah

05:37.449 --> 05:40.960
only through collaboration and

05:40.960 --> 05:42.860
cooperation or we're gonna find answers

05:42.860 --> 05:46.560
FDR found answers to problems that

05:46.560 --> 05:49.350
troubled the US and move the country

05:49.350 --> 05:53.050
forward I hope to move the oak island

05:53.050 --> 05:54.840
story forward we need to get to the

05:54.840 --> 05:57.199
bottom of it you know I'm grateful again

05:57.199 --> 05:59.150
we're grateful for all the work you did

05:59.150 --> 06:01.229
know my pleasure I'm happy to help the

06:01.229 --> 06:03.850
search continues yes thanks for know you

06:03.850 --> 06:12.290
appreciate it all good to meet you yes

06:12.290 --> 06:14.480
after a productive day of research at

06:14.480 --> 06:16.460
the FDR Presidential Library

06:16.460 --> 06:21.590
are you doing Rick lagina has traveled

06:21.590 --> 06:23.860
back to his hotel in New York City

06:23.860 --> 06:26.410
worried is eager to share the news of

06:26.410 --> 06:28.340
the day's findings with his brother

06:28.340 --> 06:33.960
Marty you know it's dynamic it's it's

06:33.960 --> 06:42.040
incredible
and you should have it's

06:42.040 --> 06:45.729
incredible I mean I I had no idea how

06:45.729 --> 06:49.229
much history is there there's seventeen

06:49.229 --> 06:58.729
million files of documents
several

06:58.729 --> 07:01.710
things one you know I was always keen to

07:01.710 --> 07:05.919
find out why he got involved right he

07:05.919 --> 07:09.050
was intrigued by the Marie Antoinette

07:09.050 --> 07:12.431
French crown jewels connection it said

07:12.431 --> 07:15.490
in there that according to historical

07:15.490 --> 07:19.130
accounts she gave the jewels to her

07:19.130 --> 07:21.750
lady-in-waiting lady-in-waiting

07:21.750 --> 07:24.870
immigrants to Canada finds her way to

07:24.870 --> 07:27.590
Nova Scotia in her later years tells

07:27.590 --> 07:30.530
people that the jewels were buried in

07:30.530 --> 07:35.410
Mahone Bay I didn't either well that was

07:35.410 --> 07:37.090
a shark this crown jewels of France

07:37.090 --> 07:40.570
theory if that was Franklin Delano

07:40.570 --> 07:42.770
Roosevelt's pet theory it's nice to know

07:42.770 --> 07:45.660
that an intelligent super accomplished

07:45.660 --> 07:47.840
human being a big figure in American

07:47.840 --> 07:50.380
history also was fascinated makes me

07:50.380 --> 07:51.960
feel like we are doing something

07:51.960 --> 07:52.960
valuable here

07:52.960 --> 07:55.860
the next step thing you go to see Xena

07:55.860 --> 07:57.150
is that right

07:57.150 --> 08:01.880
we are will meet up with her tomorrow

08:01.880 --> 08:03.919
earlier this year during the meeting

08:03.919 --> 08:06.940
with Oak Island researcher Doug Crowell

08:06.940 --> 08:11.580
by Xena it's Doug Rick and Marty lagina

08:11.580 --> 08:13.990
along with members of their team were

08:13.990 --> 08:16.400
introduced to new york-based writer and

08:16.400 --> 08:24.040
historian Xena

08:24.040 --> 08:29.630
what you're searching for here is the

08:29.630 --> 08:36.349
possible Templar connection to the new

08:36.349 --> 08:47.080
world first and then specifically oh

08:47.080 --> 08:48.870
absolutely

08:48.870 --> 08:57.100
well that's great so that'll be exciting

08:57.100 --> 08:58.680
very much look forward to it

08:58.680 --> 09:00.670
just keep me posted after that meeting

09:00.670 --> 09:03.000
no I will all right that's about all

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
I've got

09:04.000 --> 09:05.630
listen big brother that is a great

09:05.630 --> 09:07.630
summary very interesting I wish the heck

09:07.630 --> 09:09.580
I'd have been there but I'll be back

09:09.580 --> 09:12.370
tokheim and very soon okay see ya hurry

09:12.370 --> 09:23.310
up hurry back alright see ya

09:23.310 --> 09:27.430
Zenith research strikes me as not only

09:27.430 --> 09:32.170
important but even on the face of it

09:32.170 --> 09:34.020
quite credible

09:34.020 --> 09:37.880
although his fieldwork at the FDR

09:37.880 --> 09:39.950
Presidential Library has opened the door

09:39.950 --> 09:41.950
to what could be another area of

09:41.950 --> 09:44.820
investigation Rick lagina along with

09:44.820 --> 09:47.990
researcher dog growl are most excited to

09:47.990 --> 09:55.760
meet face to face with Zena Halpern
a

09:55.760 --> 09:57.780
woman who Rick believes may have

09:57.780 --> 09:59.740
discovered evidence of Templar activity

09:59.740 --> 10:02.940
on Oak Island dating as far back as the

10:02.940 --> 10:05.810
12th century the way this really

10:05.810 --> 10:08.180
surfaced was that Doug made mention that

10:08.180 --> 10:11.560
he was in contact with Zena Halpern and

10:11.560 --> 10:13.620
then I reached out to Zena and called

10:13.620 --> 10:16.110
her and she was very open and honest

10:16.110 --> 10:19.380
that her research the focus of

10:19.380 --> 10:21.399
pre-columbian contact with the new world

10:21.399 --> 10:26.060
had somehow expanded to this Oak Island

10:26.060 --> 10:28.640
connection and at that point I'm all

10:28.640 --> 10:32.950
ears a former member of the New England

10:32.950 --> 10:36.160
antiquities Research Association Zena

10:36.160 --> 10:38.110
Halpern has devoted much of the past

10:38.110 --> 10:40.730
decade to researching possible evidence

10:40.730 --> 10:42.840
of Knights Templar activity in North

10:42.840 --> 10:44.880
America

10:44.880 --> 10:46.940
it was during this time that she came

10:46.940 --> 10:49.240
into possession of three possibly

10:49.240 --> 10:51.810
authentic Templar documents each one

10:51.810 --> 10:55.010
suggesting a connection to Oak Island

10:55.010 --> 10:58.670
the approach I took was to try to fit

10:58.670 --> 11:01.519
the old French map that Xena gave us

11:01.519 --> 11:04.680
with new satellite imagery one of the

11:04.680 --> 11:08.790
maps in particular dated 1347 matched up

11:08.790 --> 11:10.600
perfectly with a number of well known

11:10.600 --> 11:13.300
sites on the island such as the swamp

11:13.300 --> 11:15.930
and the money pit look at the top of

11:15.930 --> 11:17.850
that it follows it perfectly

11:17.850 --> 11:21.779
there were also other areas indicated on

11:21.779 --> 11:24.700
the map that the team had never heard of

11:24.700 --> 11:27.760
most notably a location labeled the

11:27.760 --> 11:28.780
hatch

11:28.780 --> 11:32.550
the supposed patch is in this general

11:32.550 --> 11:34.760
area I think this is it here

11:34.760 --> 11:38.050
holy smokes

11:38.050 --> 11:45.360
these maps are part of the Templar

11:45.360 --> 11:49.670
document the main part of the book that

11:49.670 --> 11:54.380
I've written covers a 12th century

11:54.380 --> 12:02.980
Templar voyage identified from 1178 to

12:02.980 --> 12:06.790
ralph de subtly who was sent on a

12:06.790 --> 12:11.459
mission to recover ancient scrolls that

12:11.459 --> 12:15.839
were hidden in north america hailing

12:15.839 --> 12:17.810
from the Gloucestershire area of England

12:17.810 --> 12:20.860
in the 12th century a.d ralph de su de

12:20.860 --> 12:23.880
lis was a Templar knight who according

12:23.880 --> 12:26.760
to some historians not only fought for

12:26.760 --> 12:29.140
Christian causes during the period known

12:29.140 --> 12:31.980
as the Crusades but he is believed to

12:31.980 --> 12:34.149
have discovered the location of both the

12:34.149 --> 12:38.570
Ark of the Covenant and the Holy Grail

12:38.570 --> 12:40.529
so how does his voice connect to Oak

12:40.529 --> 12:42.640
Island because they stopped at Oak

12:42.640 --> 12:45.930
Island that's curious

12:45.930 --> 12:49.630
thank you let us look at the next

12:49.630 --> 12:53.100
document the Nova Scotia math shows a

12:53.100 --> 12:56.860
goal Darren Mahone Bay has two small

12:56.860 --> 13:01.769
dots and a large Inlet or a river there

13:01.769 --> 13:04.260
covers an area from west to east where

13:04.260 --> 13:08.100
there was gold the gold River flows from

13:08.100 --> 13:12.370
New Ross to Mahone Day right for what I

13:12.370 --> 13:15.430
understand the sand from the rivers had

13:15.430 --> 13:17.510
gold in it yeah some people can still

13:17.510 --> 13:20.110
pan for gold in the sand today can you

13:20.110 --> 13:21.600
imagine what it would have been five

13:21.600 --> 13:27.149
hundred years ago earlier this year Rick

13:27.149 --> 13:30.100
Marty and members of the Oak Island team

13:30.100 --> 13:32.010
visited what many believed to be the

13:32.010 --> 13:34.550
ruins of an ancient Templar Castle at

13:34.550 --> 13:37.550
new Ross in Nova Scotia on the face of

13:37.550 --> 13:39.620
the stone you can see a very faint

13:39.620 --> 13:43.100
outline of across no ordinary cross but

13:43.100 --> 13:47.180
the cross of the Knights Templar

13:47.180 --> 13:49.360
located less than 20 miles north of Oak

13:49.360 --> 13:50.360
Island

13:50.360 --> 13:52.700
it is also within yards of the gold

13:52.700 --> 13:55.529
River were in the mid-1800s

13:55.529 --> 13:58.760
gold deposits were discovered sparking a

13:58.760 --> 13:59.760
major Gold Rush

13:59.760 --> 14:03.550
but is it possible that golden nova

14:03.550 --> 14:04.550
scotia

14:04.550 --> 14:07.300
had been discovered much much earlier

14:07.300 --> 14:09.829
and had lured the Templars to Oak Island

14:09.829 --> 14:12.040
as far back as the 12th century

14:12.040 --> 14:16.620
you would think that somewhere from from

14:16.620 --> 14:18.910
subtly coming back or had to have been a

14:18.910 --> 14:22.690
transference of knowledge yeah the gold

14:22.690 --> 14:25.529
matches the area that the Templars

14:25.529 --> 14:29.269
marked off on the map mighty suggest

14:29.269 --> 14:32.200
that new Ross was important to Templars

14:32.200 --> 14:35.820
as a way to source mine and then

14:35.820 --> 14:39.440
transport gold possibly and might that

14:39.440 --> 14:41.370
be a new source of Templar wealth and

14:41.370 --> 14:45.110
influence of power originally created in

14:45.110 --> 14:47.740
the 12th century as a security force to

14:47.740 --> 14:50.230
help protect religious Christians during

14:50.230 --> 14:52.930
their pilgrimages to the Holy Land the

14:52.930 --> 14:54.970
order known as the poor fellow soldiers

14:54.970 --> 14:57.540
of Christ and the Temple of Solomon

14:57.540 --> 15:00.329
otherwise known as the Knights Templar

15:00.329 --> 15:03.450
quickly gained in power and influence

15:03.450 --> 15:05.690
because many wealthy noblemen entrusted

15:05.690 --> 15:07.829
them with the safekeeping of their gold

15:07.829 --> 15:10.320
and other valuables they became

15:10.320 --> 15:13.260
effectively the first bankers even

15:13.260 --> 15:15.800
creating coins and other currencies

15:15.800 --> 15:18.510
which were in turn backed by their vast

15:18.510 --> 15:19.510
holdings

15:19.510 --> 15:24.639
now look here we have a temple coins

15:24.639 --> 15:29.480
those four dots are the mythmakers style

15:29.480 --> 15:33.769
of embellishing coins and it's only on

15:33.769 --> 15:38.079
Templar crosses then I began to think of

15:38.079 --> 15:41.510
your wish you foliation o stone and I

15:41.510 --> 15:44.730
saw that template course with those four

15:44.730 --> 15:50.760
dots in 1921 treasure hunters found a

15:50.760 --> 15:53.070
huge boulder on the northern shore of

15:53.070 --> 15:55.970
Oak Island covered with mysterious

15:55.970 --> 15:59.750
carved inscriptions thinking it could be

15:59.750 --> 16:02.260
a marker for buried treasure they

16:02.260 --> 16:04.430
detonated it with dynamite before

16:04.430 --> 16:08.300
digging underneath although nothing at

16:08.300 --> 16:12.589
the time was found in 1936 treasure

16:12.589 --> 16:14.790
hunter Gilbert Hedden salvaged some of

16:14.790 --> 16:17.360
the remaining fragments including one

16:17.360 --> 16:19.410
that was later nicknamed the age no

16:19.410 --> 16:22.790
stone because it featured an H a circle

16:22.790 --> 16:25.699
with a dot in the center and a cross

16:25.699 --> 16:28.690
with four small dots around it could

16:28.690 --> 16:30.880
Xena Halpern have just made a credible

16:30.880 --> 16:33.139
connection linking ancient Templar

16:33.139 --> 16:35.519
markings to one of the most intriguing

16:35.519 --> 16:38.230
stone carvings ever found on Oak Island

16:38.230 --> 16:42.390
look I've always believed that there was

16:42.390 --> 16:44.269
an incredible story connected with Oak

16:44.269 --> 16:46.079
Island you've now informed us that

16:46.079 --> 16:49.180
indeed that is so but what is really

16:49.180 --> 16:51.500
striking to me is that I thought the

16:51.500 --> 16:54.060
story would be four five hundred years

16:54.060 --> 16:56.040
old it now appears as though it's a

16:56.040 --> 16:59.430
thousand years old or more that is

16:59.430 --> 17:00.430
incredible

17:00.430 --> 17:03.800
as credible as I deem as in his research

17:03.800 --> 17:07.069
to be it is but theory at this point now

17:07.069 --> 17:10.019
she's provided documents incredibly

17:10.019 --> 17:12.699
interesting but there's a very rich

17:12.699 --> 17:15.669
story that's constantly evolving about

17:15.669 --> 17:19.009
those documents at some point I'm hoping

17:19.009 --> 17:20.939
that we can reach a greater

17:20.939 --> 17:24.279
understanding and the gate opens thank

17:24.279 --> 17:26.480
you very much appreciate you

17:26.480 --> 17:33.019
all right let's go judges mr. Cole sure

17:33.019 --> 17:36.070
following his productive research trip

17:36.070 --> 17:39.039
to New York Rick lagina has returned to

17:39.039 --> 17:47.299
Oak Island he is now more convinced than

17:47.299 --> 17:49.529
ever that's something of incredible

17:49.529 --> 17:52.610
importance lies buried there and that he

17:52.610 --> 17:54.789
and the team may be within days of

17:54.789 --> 17:59.480
finding out what it is okay okay

17:59.480 --> 18:01.809
Jack's gonna explain what he was we're

18:01.809 --> 18:03.649
gonna do we'll figure out where we went

18:03.649 --> 18:04.649
this head wall at then we're gonna place

18:04.649 --> 18:07.789
the dam right on top of that roll it off

18:07.789 --> 18:09.369
we need to have this up about eight foot

18:09.369 --> 18:11.820
from the deepest spot out there today

18:11.820 --> 18:14.159
Rick along with Craig tester and DES

18:14.159 --> 18:17.190
stepson Jack Begley have invited confer

18:17.190 --> 18:20.249
dam manufacturer Jack Nichols to meet at

18:20.249 --> 18:23.090
Smith's Cove they will make a second

18:23.090 --> 18:25.659
attempt to wall off water from the area

18:25.659 --> 18:26.990
where there are believed to be the

18:26.990 --> 18:29.409
remnants of a series of five ancient

18:29.409 --> 18:33.779
stone box drains water instead of laying

18:33.779 --> 18:35.639
it out like you don't want to put it out

18:35.639 --> 18:36.970
just roll it out like carpet with a

18:36.970 --> 18:38.139
little water in it that'll take the

18:38.139 --> 18:40.789
wrinkles out of it should conform pretty

18:40.789 --> 18:43.210
good I think we'll be good going okay on

18:43.210 --> 18:46.169
my method here okay the cofferdam will

18:46.169 --> 18:49.000
be composed of two 200 foot long

18:49.000 --> 18:51.320
inflatable sections that are connected

18:51.320 --> 18:54.990
to form a large barrier around the code

18:54.990 --> 18:56.809
we're gonna roll out a first down let's

18:56.809 --> 19:00.649
do this last week the team attempted to

19:00.649 --> 19:03.529
install a different copper dam system

19:03.529 --> 19:06.129
one comprised of four 100-foot long

19:06.129 --> 19:08.759
sections designed to envelop a larger

19:08.759 --> 19:11.690
area but just as the team began

19:11.690 --> 19:13.499
inflating the sections of the bladder

19:13.499 --> 19:16.129
system it burst wide open

19:16.129 --> 19:22.979
Oh No we got a big leak whoa it's

19:22.979 --> 19:25.379
pouring out over there

19:25.379 --> 19:28.159
given the fact that we already had one

19:28.159 --> 19:30.659
rupture I think we're gonna have to be

19:30.659 --> 19:32.859
exceedingly careful with the install of

19:32.859 --> 19:36.559
this confer dam picture a giant balloon

19:36.559 --> 19:39.879
balloon very thick very tough rubbers

19:39.879 --> 19:43.840
that you just pump seawater into it

19:43.840 --> 19:45.620
forms a ring around the cove and then

19:45.620 --> 19:47.690
you pump the seawater back over the top

19:47.690 --> 19:49.480
of it it's all temporary for a

19:49.480 --> 19:53.320
sufficient time to excavate hey guys

19:53.320 --> 19:55.779
how's it going going good it's really

19:55.779 --> 19:58.369
cool looks like it'll work god I

19:58.369 --> 20:00.669
shouldn't have said that I think you're

20:00.669 --> 20:01.669
gonna be fine

20:01.669 --> 20:04.520
you're gonna be fine we have to keep the

20:04.520 --> 20:08.190
water out of this dig site you find the

20:08.190 --> 20:10.740
box drains you prove that the booby trap

20:10.740 --> 20:13.919
system is real what that tells you is

20:13.919 --> 20:16.510
someone went through a lot of trouble to

20:16.510 --> 20:18.259
protect whatever it was in the money pit

20:18.259 --> 20:21.909
I mean that's highly significant well

20:21.909 --> 20:23.679
Rick you're getting kind of excited it

20:23.679 --> 20:25.039
actually looks like it might work I'm

20:25.039 --> 20:27.289
looking forward to taking a look see I'm

20:27.289 --> 20:28.649
hoping you see that what's been

20:28.649 --> 20:31.669
described before an elaborate well made

20:31.669 --> 20:34.399
system if there's any left of it now

20:34.399 --> 20:36.690
that the new copper dam system has been

20:36.690 --> 20:38.659
installed

20:38.659 --> 20:41.090
the team want access to a search area of

20:41.090 --> 20:45.359
approximately 9,000 square feet and

20:45.359 --> 20:47.669
assuming this one holds they will be

20:47.669 --> 20:49.749
able to carefully excavate the rocky

20:49.749 --> 20:52.259
cove in a way that has not been done for

20:52.259 --> 20:55.409
nearly 50 years oh it doesn't look too

20:55.409 --> 20:58.270
bad and we got a beautiful day learn all

20:58.270 --> 21:00.190
right nice to see you again

21:00.190 --> 21:02.379
we have an archaeologist on site letter

21:02.379 --> 21:04.880
Niven to coordinate and make sure that

21:04.880 --> 21:07.859
we do a proper archaeological dig so

21:07.859 --> 21:10.210
this is our project here Dan will

21:10.210 --> 21:13.259
delineate the area okay if we find

21:13.259 --> 21:15.470
something of significant interest which

21:15.470 --> 21:17.289
you will be able to determine that for

21:17.289 --> 21:19.840
us the whole idea is to find original

21:19.840 --> 21:22.830
works and specific so I'll get the gear

21:22.830 --> 21:25.820
you guys set out the parameters and okay

21:25.820 --> 21:30.109
how and where and how deep okay okay I'm

21:30.109 --> 21:32.429
super excited about Smith's Cove because

21:32.429 --> 21:36.609
he is you know he's always about the

21:36.609 --> 21:38.059
clues the mystery the puzzle

21:38.059 --> 21:42.550
okay that feels like it might be a

21:42.550 --> 21:43.999
different kind of bottom which makes

21:43.999 --> 21:44.999
sense

21:44.999 --> 21:47.039
it just felt with this shovel that

21:47.039 --> 21:49.340
they're gonna start to get into more

21:49.340 --> 21:53.970
solid stuff for me it's a trail of clues

21:53.970 --> 21:55.989
if there's a remnant of the Box drain

21:55.989 --> 21:59.280
system it's proof that the original

21:59.280 --> 22:01.259
story is true

22:01.259 --> 22:05.009
so Smith's Cove in my opinion is every

22:05.009 --> 22:07.490
bit as important as the money pit what

22:07.490 --> 22:14.780
do you make of this
there's no play and

22:14.780 --> 22:17.029
the natural formation as far as I know

22:17.029 --> 22:19.999
here so any clay that should be here is

22:19.999 --> 22:24.229
put by man pretty much could Rick in the

22:24.229 --> 22:26.970
team have just found part of a man-made

22:26.970 --> 22:29.889
structure perhaps one similar to the

22:29.889 --> 22:32.679
elaborate system of box drains and flood

22:32.679 --> 22:36.009
tunnels right here

22:36.009 --> 22:40.330
here's coconut fiber I think this is

22:40.330 --> 22:42.539
coconut fiber for sure we're definitely

22:42.539 --> 22:46.080
in the right area when the Box train

22:46.080 --> 22:48.279
system was first discovered by the true

22:48.279 --> 22:52.039
row company in 1850 it was reported to

22:52.039 --> 22:53.609
have been covered with layers of

22:53.609 --> 22:56.639
eelgrass and coconut fiber which acted

22:56.639 --> 22:58.909
like a filter to keep debris and

22:58.909 --> 23:03.039
sediment from clogging the flood tunnels

23:03.039 --> 23:05.529
yeah that's a lot of coconut fiber mixed

23:05.529 --> 23:08.369
in with the quay and wheel grass the

23:08.369 --> 23:10.700
presence of coconut fiber on Oak Island

23:10.700 --> 23:13.399
is significant since the nearest living

23:13.399 --> 23:15.820
coconut trees are nearly two thousand

23:15.820 --> 23:24.220
miles away
but even more astounding is

23:24.220 --> 23:26.659
the fact that when dan henskee and the

23:26.659 --> 23:28.809
team found even more coconut fiber at

23:28.809 --> 23:32.299
Smith's Cove three years ago it was

23:32.299 --> 23:35.970
carbon dated to be between 600 to 800

23:35.970 --> 23:42.609
years old organic first organic layer

23:42.609 --> 23:47.309
here and then a layer of sand and then a

23:47.309 --> 23:50.490
second thicker organic layer there's no

23:50.490 --> 23:52.119
question about it there is a

23:52.119 --> 23:54.600
stratification there a layered system

23:54.600 --> 23:56.619
that can only have been put down by

23:56.619 --> 23:57.619
human hands

23:57.619 --> 24:22.369
anything waiter that that's perfect I

24:22.369 --> 24:25.279
want to clear here take get that out and

24:25.279 --> 24:27.210
get a few bytes back here okay

24:27.210 --> 24:51.690
wait-wait-wait Oh Rick look at this

24:51.690 --> 25:01.840
wait wait wait Oh little wood in there

25:01.840 --> 25:06.919
more than a little

25:06.919 --> 25:08.039
Rick look at this

25:08.039 --> 25:11.200
can you see this piece of wood right

25:11.200 --> 25:14.279
here seems really blocking

25:14.279 --> 25:17.049
blackened wood found beneath Smith's

25:17.049 --> 25:19.950
Cove could Rickon the team beyond the

25:19.950 --> 25:22.379
verge of discovering another man-made

25:22.379 --> 25:25.830
structure perhaps one that's even older

25:25.830 --> 25:28.140
and more elaborately engineered than the

25:28.140 --> 25:31.099
legendary flood tunnels there's there's

25:31.099 --> 25:32.359
a bunch of them and they're all running

25:32.359 --> 25:33.359
in the same direction

25:33.359 --> 25:38.429
what do you what do you think learn I

25:38.429 --> 25:39.429
mean what do you think

25:39.429 --> 25:40.929
well definitely something's intruded in

25:40.929 --> 25:43.129
here it's definitely heading this way

25:43.129 --> 25:46.330
yeah there's more here wow wow that's

25:46.330 --> 25:47.369
pretty solid

25:47.369 --> 25:49.769
definitely the clay layer continues here

25:49.769 --> 25:53.460
that's for sure at a substantial timber

25:53.460 --> 25:57.390
here that is I expected a variety of

25:57.390 --> 25:59.389
stuff but this is exceeding my

25:59.389 --> 26:03.450
expectations for sure we tagged into

26:03.450 --> 26:05.820
some wood it's blocking wood what does

26:05.820 --> 26:06.890
that mean it's oil

26:06.890 --> 26:11.440
it's a significant discovery there might

26:11.440 --> 26:14.539
be the remains of a trench deeper so we

26:14.539 --> 26:16.710
ought to take a few scoops and say you

26:16.710 --> 26:18.820
want to go that we were well deeper

26:18.820 --> 26:22.690
first cuz you've got an extra five feet

26:22.690 --> 26:25.049
now just find out if there's a boil

26:25.049 --> 26:26.080
define trench down there

26:26.080 --> 26:38.669
oh this way

26:38.669 --> 26:47.080
Oh y-yeah

26:47.080 --> 26:49.049
that doesn't look natural to me what do

26:49.049 --> 26:50.929
you think I think we're into something

26:50.929 --> 26:53.360
Rick

26:53.360 --> 26:56.000
you want to come out and look at this

26:56.000 --> 26:57.120
Rick yep

26:57.120 --> 26:58.929
while looking for evidence of ancient

26:58.929 --> 27:02.289
man-made box drains at Smith's Cove Rick

27:02.289 --> 27:04.389
lagina and members of the Oak Island

27:04.389 --> 27:07.679
team may have just made an incredible

27:07.679 --> 27:08.679
discovery

27:08.679 --> 27:09.989
what do you think that's from

27:09.989 --> 27:12.909
it's a structure no question about that

27:12.909 --> 27:18.460
the probability of drift would be in

27:18.460 --> 27:20.859
that level is

27:20.859 --> 27:23.619
yep is this the other edge of it yeah

27:23.619 --> 27:26.629
yeah I think we're finding another edge

27:26.629 --> 27:30.759
that could be a small shaft with a cover

27:30.759 --> 27:31.759
on it

27:31.759 --> 27:35.200
a wooden shaft built below Smith's Cove

27:35.200 --> 27:39.809
but if so when was it constructed and by

27:39.809 --> 27:40.809
whom

27:40.809 --> 27:43.989
it could be right through here possibly

27:43.989 --> 27:47.440
no such mixed up altogether here yeah

27:47.440 --> 27:50.471
but this has definitely built the whole

27:50.471 --> 27:52.710
point of the exercise in Smith's coat is

27:52.710 --> 27:56.399
to prove that there are structures that

27:56.399 --> 27:59.509
yet remain that can prove the existence

27:59.509 --> 28:01.729
of the artificial beach and this might

28:01.729 --> 28:05.330
be that very structure in an effort to

28:05.330 --> 28:07.399
determine whether or not the team has

28:07.399 --> 28:08.980
found one of the original treasure

28:08.980 --> 28:12.129
shafts Charles Barkhouse has been asked

28:12.129 --> 28:14.620
to join the team and to offer his

28:14.620 --> 28:17.649
insight it's like you've been busy what

28:17.649 --> 28:24.059
do you think I went baffling status you

28:24.059 --> 28:26.649
know I brought some some diagrams that

28:26.649 --> 28:28.839
Robert rest all had done and his work in

28:28.839 --> 28:31.849
Smith's Cove and also you see here those

28:31.849 --> 28:34.239
are shafts that were put in trying to

28:34.239 --> 28:36.929
intercept the assume you know flood

28:36.929 --> 28:41.690
tunnel that was coming in in 1965

28:41.690 --> 28:44.429
treasure hunter Robert Restall excavated

28:44.429 --> 28:47.429
Smith's Cove and uncovered part of what

28:47.429 --> 28:49.830
he believed to be the remains of the

28:49.830 --> 28:53.210
booby-trapped flood system it was this

28:53.210 --> 28:55.489
discovery that convinced him that if he

28:55.489 --> 28:58.149
could find even the remains of one box

28:58.149 --> 29:00.480
drain he could trace it all the way to

29:00.480 --> 29:01.839
the original treasure vault

29:01.839 --> 29:05.509
unfortunately Robert Restall would never

29:05.509 --> 29:09.109
live long enough to test his theory on

29:09.109 --> 29:12.710
August 17th he along with his oldest son

29:12.710 --> 29:16.070
Bobby and two other men died shortly

29:16.070 --> 29:20.099
after being overcome by deadly h2s gas

29:20.099 --> 29:22.299
which was emanating from the bottom of a

29:22.299 --> 29:24.179
27 foot deep searcher shaft

29:24.179 --> 29:27.929
if you can see right here Charles yeah

29:27.929 --> 29:31.509
there's another another board there's

29:31.509 --> 29:34.859
nothing under there right it's laying

29:34.859 --> 29:37.500
right on top of the clay and I can feel

29:37.500 --> 29:40.429
right under it unfortunately for Rick

29:40.429 --> 29:42.929
and the team the Sun is rapidly

29:42.929 --> 29:46.159
disappearing over the horizon they may

29:46.159 --> 29:48.789
have to wait a while longer before that

29:48.789 --> 29:50.539
can confirm whether or not what they

29:50.539 --> 29:52.649
found is part of the ancient box train

29:52.649 --> 29:55.479
system or something of a more recent

29:55.479 --> 29:58.849
origin or just a ditch start of it and

29:58.849 --> 30:01.129
there is a lot of work yet to be done

30:01.129 --> 30:03.159
well we've succeeded at least initially

30:03.159 --> 30:06.710
in our goals we are hopeful that the

30:06.710 --> 30:08.840
trench is gonna lead to the box trains

30:08.840 --> 30:11.499
okay so Charles we're not done here but

30:11.499 --> 30:13.389
I'm done here for the moment yeah

30:13.389 --> 30:16.070
it's getting towards dark so what we're

30:16.070 --> 30:19.169
done then right for the day yeah all

30:19.169 --> 30:23.739
right okay it is the start of another

30:23.739 --> 30:29.559
new day on Oak Island the sanctum

30:29.559 --> 30:31.619
sanctorum before returning to their

30:31.619 --> 30:35.570
operations at Smith's Cove Rick Marty

30:35.570 --> 30:37.919
and members of the team arrive at the

30:37.919 --> 30:42.190
home of dan Blankenship here they are

30:42.190 --> 30:43.870
hoping to find information that will

30:43.870 --> 30:46.299
help them pinpoint another drill site

30:46.299 --> 30:48.999
their third in this year's tireless

30:48.999 --> 30:51.960
search for the infamous Oak Island money

30:51.960 --> 30:59.899
pit let's find out what we can I want to

30:59.899 --> 31:02.959
go through the record so far this year

31:02.959 --> 31:06.239
Marty Rick Greg and the team have dug

31:06.239 --> 31:09.419
two massive 200-foot deep holes in the

31:09.419 --> 31:11.419
area near the money pits last known

31:11.419 --> 31:14.869
location but although the multi-million

31:14.869 --> 31:17.239
dollar operation turned up much in the

31:17.239 --> 31:23.349
way of compelling evidence wood and

31:23.349 --> 31:24.659
important information

31:24.659 --> 31:33.580
they have so far been unable to reach

31:33.580 --> 31:35.960
their elusive target chances of it being

31:35.960 --> 31:39.070
man-made very small it's a small small

31:39.070 --> 31:42.830
chance

31:42.830 --> 31:44.859
we're the third hole go is is a problem

31:44.859 --> 31:47.259
we don't have an obvious target we don't

31:47.259 --> 31:50.259
we have inferential targets areas

31:50.259 --> 31:52.009
unexplored in the money pit where that

31:52.009 --> 31:54.599
vault might have ended up so there are

31:54.599 --> 31:56.459
several possibilities and it's a dilemma

31:56.459 --> 32:01.929
there's the drill reports ok look at

32:01.929 --> 32:08.330
pictures in the more than five decades

32:08.330 --> 32:10.460
that dan Blankenship has lived and

32:10.460 --> 32:13.320
worked on Oak Island trying to solve the

32:13.320 --> 32:17.330
221 year old mystery he has collected a

32:17.330 --> 32:20.359
virtual treasure trove of maps

32:20.359 --> 32:23.969
measurements photos and first-hand

32:23.969 --> 32:26.789
information going as far back as the

32:26.789 --> 32:30.850
1840s but even more valuable than the

32:30.850 --> 32:33.080
fragile material dan keeps carefully

32:33.080 --> 32:35.979
stored away in the basement of his home

32:35.979 --> 32:37.889
is the vast amount of knowledge the

32:37.889 --> 32:40.359
veteran treasure hunter keeps within his

32:40.359 --> 32:41.619
93 year old brain

32:41.619 --> 32:46.929
I've not seen this before Fred Nolan

32:46.929 --> 32:51.950
surveyor drill hole locations Fred Nolan

32:51.950 --> 32:53.779
surveyed them all in but he may have

32:53.779 --> 32:56.849
made the plan that's my writing on there

32:56.849 --> 32:58.299
yeah that's what I think Dan I think

32:58.299 --> 33:00.570
Fred did this and you did this what were

33:00.570 --> 33:01.840
you guys doing cooperating

33:01.840 --> 33:09.409
I dropped white Devils being down at

33:09.409 --> 33:11.070
Dan's basement for looking through a

33:11.070 --> 33:13.989
lifetime of search on Oak Island there's

33:13.989 --> 33:16.130
a lot of information to be gleaned from

33:16.130 --> 33:18.159
that material hopefully we'll find

33:18.159 --> 33:20.039
something

33:20.039 --> 33:22.239
listen to this letter to Gilbert Hedden

33:22.239 --> 33:27.639
from Mr Chappell 1966 and he says when

33:27.639 --> 33:29.559
he excavated a very few feet he found

33:29.559 --> 33:31.719
that he was in a circular shaft about 12

33:31.719 --> 33:34.200
feet in diameter so money bid the money

33:34.200 --> 33:37.380
pit

33:37.380 --> 33:42.609
then is it possible that everybody just

33:42.609 --> 33:45.750
missed this just missed this just missed

33:45.750 --> 33:48.639
we just missed everybody just missed

33:48.639 --> 33:50.399
while searching in the basement office

33:50.399 --> 33:52.469
of Oak Island resident and legendary

33:52.469 --> 33:55.659
treasure hunter dan Blankenship Rick and

33:55.659 --> 33:58.659
Marty lagina along with Dave Blankenship

33:58.659 --> 34:01.259
and Craig tester are hoping to find

34:01.259 --> 34:03.589
information from past searchers that

34:03.589 --> 34:05.239
will guide them as to the precise

34:05.239 --> 34:09.230
location of the original money bet the

34:09.230 --> 34:11.869
stakes are high as millions of dollars

34:11.869 --> 34:15.500
have already been spent this year

34:15.500 --> 34:18.379
Marty Rick and Craig are convinced that

34:18.379 --> 34:21.139
if they can find the original money pit

34:21.139 --> 34:23.329
then finding the treasure and solving

34:23.329 --> 34:26.219
the mystery will happen soon afterward

34:26.219 --> 34:35.500
hey Dan whose map is this Mr gave

34:35.500 --> 34:37.440
doesn't feel the location where he

34:37.440 --> 34:38.440
681

34:38.440 --> 34:40.599
thought the original fit was and that's

34:40.599 --> 34:43.129
where he he dug it was in that

34:43.129 --> 34:46.230
neighborhood

34:46.230 --> 34:48.920
in the early 1930s treasure hunter

34:48.920 --> 34:51.540
Melbourne Chappell created a detailed

34:51.540 --> 34:54.149
diagram of the money pit area noting

34:54.149 --> 34:56.050
where the original pit was believed to

34:56.050 --> 34:59.530
be in fact he was so confident that he

34:59.530 --> 35:02.420
had found the exact location it was not

35:02.420 --> 35:04.760
long before he and his father William

35:04.760 --> 35:07.250
began construction on a searcher tunnel

35:07.250 --> 35:09.130
they believed could reach the fabled

35:09.130 --> 35:12.710
treasure vault unfortunately their plans

35:12.710 --> 35:15.200
were thwarted when ocean water from one

35:15.200 --> 35:17.430
of the flood tunnels rushed in and

35:17.430 --> 35:20.220
destroyed their shaft the remnants of

35:20.220 --> 35:22.430
which were discovered by Marty and Rick

35:22.430 --> 35:25.030
earlier this year after drilling a hole

35:25.030 --> 35:29.680
in the area known as Bali 3 we seen

35:29.680 --> 35:32.300
somewhere it's probably part of chakra

35:32.300 --> 35:35.400
shaft

35:35.400 --> 35:37.329
it was the first I'd seen the originals

35:37.329 --> 35:39.779
of many of those things I'd seen copies

35:39.779 --> 35:43.080
me a lot of it was new and some of it I

35:43.080 --> 35:46.079
think was new to everybody this is the

35:46.079 --> 35:47.730
one they drilled from that's the spot

35:47.730 --> 35:50.520
they drilled and hid the chamber from

35:50.520 --> 35:54.630
this was the shaft why the hell didn't

35:54.630 --> 35:57.840
they why did the Chappell shaft not dig

35:57.840 --> 36:01.970
there that's my mo of a solar set this

36:01.970 --> 36:04.760
was 34 years later so they'd lost

36:04.760 --> 36:06.980
exactly where it was look I'm just one

36:06.980 --> 36:08.849
vote when I look at this you know just

36:08.849 --> 36:11.170
brand new with this is the shaft they

36:11.170 --> 36:13.900
dug and found the parchment and the gold

36:13.900 --> 36:15.579
I think who should dig right here no

36:15.579 --> 36:17.859
question about it

36:17.859 --> 36:21.359
I respectfully disagree we need to sit

36:21.359 --> 36:23.970
down and look at this we are sitting

36:23.970 --> 36:28.380
down and we are looking at we don't have

36:28.380 --> 36:29.380
much time

36:29.380 --> 36:31.109
Craig wait you're weird what do you want

36:31.109 --> 36:33.160
to take well I don't know I guess I'm

36:33.160 --> 36:35.800
pushing him towards this corner in here

36:35.800 --> 36:42.750
all right from here you want to go in

36:42.750 --> 36:48.609
here what between all those wells yeah

36:48.609 --> 36:53.349
that's all right

36:53.349 --> 36:56.670
we're the third hole go is is a problem

36:56.670 --> 36:59.250
because the members of the fellowship

36:59.250 --> 37:00.819
have a different idea about where that

37:00.819 --> 37:03.060
hole should be Craig wants to go to the

37:03.060 --> 37:05.329
northeast for his reasons and Rick and

37:05.329 --> 37:07.250
David probably want to go southwest of

37:07.250 --> 37:09.950
e3 and we all have our reasons we're

37:09.950 --> 37:12.010
caught between the devil and the diesel

37:12.010 --> 37:13.810
you see here because we have a massive

37:13.810 --> 37:15.900
piece of equipment that's we know we

37:15.900 --> 37:17.880
can't we can't let that dictate I can

37:17.880 --> 37:20.619
see why you know years ago they just all

37:20.619 --> 37:23.019
hang it let's do a big dig let's dig the

37:23.019 --> 37:25.099
whole thing up the last thing we need to

37:25.099 --> 37:27.780
do is make a decision based on oh dear

37:27.780 --> 37:30.460
we must decide I mean a hasty decision

37:30.460 --> 37:32.849
is generally always the wrong one and so

37:32.849 --> 37:34.260
to that end we have to be careful in

37:34.260 --> 37:36.369
Mullis decision over it's important

37:36.369 --> 37:38.779
you're gonna photocopy that tomorrow go

37:38.779 --> 37:42.240
ahead you may guess just just don't take

37:42.240 --> 37:46.609
it no we've all studied it to varying

37:46.609 --> 37:49.030
degrees we all have a different place we

37:49.030 --> 37:51.900
want to dig a hole but we can only dig

37:51.900 --> 37:54.619
the one so we'll find out where that is

37:54.619 --> 37:56.641
okay guys we've come as far as we can

37:56.641 --> 37:58.160
hear right now and we'll talk about it

37:58.160 --> 37:59.160
tomorrow and make a decision

37:59.160 --> 38:03.539
thank you dan let's let's go

38:03.539 --> 38:09.640
how we doing gentlemen oh yeah good yeah

38:09.640 --> 38:13.410
oh uh good for brothers Rick and Marty

38:13.410 --> 38:16.329
lagina the quest to locate the original

38:16.329 --> 38:18.600
money pit and the so-called Chappell

38:18.600 --> 38:21.390
vault has proven to be a much greater

38:21.390 --> 38:24.420
challenge than they expected convinced

38:24.420 --> 38:32.700
that they are closer to finding the

38:32.700 --> 38:34.470
original money pit than anyone else has

38:34.470 --> 38:37.799
gotten in more than 100 years those your

38:37.799 --> 38:41.019
whole right there okay he just sprayed

38:41.019 --> 38:42.950
it great that's x marks the spot

38:42.950 --> 38:47.579
they have decided to allow their friend

38:47.579 --> 38:50.269
and partner Craig tester to choose the

38:50.269 --> 38:52.970
site of the summers third and possibly

38:52.970 --> 38:58.410
last exploratory shaft third hall x

38:58.410 --> 38:59.410
marks the spot

38:59.410 --> 39:02.569
do you one tester one so Craig how did

39:02.569 --> 39:05.140
you guys arrive the conclusion for the

39:05.140 --> 39:07.510
third hall well my thinking was there

39:07.510 --> 39:09.440
was records that indicate that Chappell

39:09.440 --> 39:13.450
shaft was south of the money pit so you

39:13.450 --> 39:15.010
know we have to go this way to hit the

39:15.010 --> 39:16.619
money pit and I know if we go too far

39:16.619 --> 39:18.240
that way they know son you're at the

39:18.240 --> 39:21.820
head and shaft the old head and shaft in

39:21.820 --> 39:24.930
1937 treasure hunter Gilbert Hedden dug

39:24.930 --> 39:29.650
a 12 by 24 foot wooden shaft down nearly

39:29.650 --> 39:33.200
125 feet in search of the original money

39:33.200 --> 39:36.140
pit and the Chappell vault

39:36.140 --> 39:38.039
although heaven was unsuccessful

39:38.039 --> 39:41.119
he believed he may have just missed them

39:41.119 --> 39:45.750
by only a few feet

39:45.750 --> 39:49.170
looks like it's right here last summer

39:49.170 --> 39:51.530
Rick and Marty lagina along with

39:51.530 --> 39:54.269
treasure hunter dan henskee unearthed

39:54.269 --> 39:56.839
the remains of the head and shaft and

39:56.839 --> 40:00.250
marked its precise location using GPS to

40:00.250 --> 40:03.190
wade them in future digging efforts we

40:03.190 --> 40:05.059
have found it that is clearly the

40:05.059 --> 40:09.210
exterior wall of the old head and shaft

40:09.210 --> 40:10.210
throw up head and chefs there and it

40:10.210 --> 40:11.650

40:51.600 --> 40:53.279
week has been a productive one for

40:53.279 --> 40:55.839
gathering new clues and finding physical

40:55.839 --> 40:58.809
evidence that a valuable treasure really

40:58.809 --> 41:00.650
could lie buried on Oak Island

41:00.650 --> 41:04.829
but it's successful what will they

41:04.829 --> 41:08.329
discover priceless crown jewels sacred

41:08.329 --> 41:09.549
religious artifacts

41:09.549 --> 41:13.430
will it be something so incredible that

41:13.430 --> 41:16.700
finding it will explain why it needed to

41:16.700 --> 41:19.799
be so elaborately and ingeniously hidden

41:19.799 --> 41:28.200
away for more than 221 years next time

41:28.200 --> 41:30.170
on the curse of Oak Island

41:30.170 --> 41:34.109
pack with stone isn't it the flood

41:34.109 --> 41:35.680
tunnels it's the Box tricks

41:35.680 --> 41:39.280
this was what was done to protect the

41:39.280 --> 41:40.280
treasure and the money that's beginning

41:40.280 --> 41:41.529
to look interesting there's a chamber or

41:41.529 --> 41:43.840
tunnel system going from the table to

41:43.840 --> 41:46.220
the mash Eileen and in that chamber

41:46.220 --> 41:48.750
there are several hundred tons of gold

41:48.750 --> 41:52.150
for you is a big piece of wood chop this

41:52.150 --> 41:54.600
is part of the original money pit

41:54.624 --> 41:58.324
