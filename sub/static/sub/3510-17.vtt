00:36.358 --> 00:39.226
She screamed as the pain
ripped through her,

00:39.674 --> 00:42.230
and in between each labored
breath, she thought,

00:42.336 --> 00:44.713
there is no way in hell
I am having this baby

00:44.714 --> 00:46.698
on a subway train in the Bronx.

00:48.570 --> 00:49.355
Did you get all that?

00:49.640 --> 00:51.737
So you actually gave birth
to your son on the Metro?

00:51.842 --> 00:52.505
No.

00:52.747 --> 00:53.554
She didn't.

00:53.776 --> 00:56.323
She also didn't run a marathon
the week before she had me

00:56.324 --> 00:58.668
or beat up a mugger while
nine months pregnant.

00:58.669 --> 01:00.408
It's called dramatic
license, darling.

01:00.409 --> 01:02.452
Actually, it's called
wild exaggeration.

01:02.453 --> 01:03.888
Dramatic license
plies to writing.

01:03.906 --> 01:04.927
And that's what I'm doing.

01:05.173 --> 01:06.001
This is Marcus,

01:06.137 --> 01:08.632
this fabulous young
playwright I told you about,

01:08.633 --> 01:10.810
who's helping me put
together my one-woman show.

01:10.811 --> 01:12.131
Mr. Castle, I'm a huge fan.

01:12.517 --> 01:14.659
Just being in this office
is a dream come true.

01:14.720 --> 01:15.973
For me, too. For me, too.

01:16.032 --> 01:17.367
Only in my dreams, I'm...

01:17.766 --> 01:18.689
usually by myself.

01:18.886 --> 01:22.435
We just felt that this room
had the best creative juju.

01:22.436 --> 01:23.732
Oh, it does. It does.

01:23.844 --> 01:25.478
Yeah, I wrote 20 best
sellers in here.

01:26.357 --> 01:26.950
Right, right.

01:27.945 --> 01:28.916
I'd like to write another one.

01:31.279 --> 01:31.955
Now.

01:32.169 --> 01:33.970
Oh, can't it wait, dear?

01:33.971 --> 01:36.319
We're just putting the
final touches on act one--

01:36.469 --> 01:39.200
you know, where I overcome
the challenges of being

01:39.258 --> 01:41.299
a single, working mother.

01:42.399 --> 01:43.471
You know you're

01:43.528 --> 01:44.700
writing a workf fiction, right?

01:46.419 --> 01:47.098
Castle.

01:47.696 --> 01:51.122
First Alexis is interning for Lanie.
Thank you.

01:51.228 --> 01:53.130
Now my mother is
taking over my office.

01:53.131 --> 01:55.012
I feel like my whole
life is being invaded.

01:55.013 --> 01:56.883
You'll get used to it. I did.

02:00.200 --> 02:02.503
Okay, it's similar, just
much less invasive.

02:02.968 --> 02:03.643
Hey, Lanie.

02:04.077 --> 02:04.928
So what do we got here?

02:05.231 --> 02:06.418
That's a good question.

02:06.571 --> 02:07.898
I can tell you this much--

02:07.929 --> 02:09.681
based on body temp and lividity,

02:09.681 --> 02:11.983
our victim died between
10:00 and midnight.

02:12.501 --> 02:13.396
Claw marks?

02:13.776 --> 02:14.935
She was attacked by an animal?

02:15.400 --> 02:17.678
Well, she was running
from something.

02:17.742 --> 02:18.945
She's got dirt on her feet.

02:19.389 --> 02:20.901
What animal in central park

02:20.902 --> 02:22.340
could maul a person to death?

02:22.607 --> 02:24.611
I'm not even sure
that's what happened.

02:24.891 --> 02:27.944
These lacerations look
shallow, nonlethal,

02:27.945 --> 02:29.553
but I won't know exactly
what killed her

02:29.554 --> 02:30.748
until I get her
back to the morgue.

02:30.808 --> 02:31.561
Do you have an ID?

02:31.787 --> 02:34.081
No wallet or purse, so we
don't know who she is.

02:39.512 --> 02:41.726
Isn't it obvious?
I mean, am I the only one seeing this?

02:41.910 --> 02:42.511
What?

02:43.080 --> 02:45.277
Red cloak, in the
woods, animal attack.

02:46.726 --> 02:48.256
She's little Red Riding Hood.

02:49.026 --> 02:51.857
Great, Castle. I'll call in an APB
for the Big Bad Wolf.

02:52.533 --> 02:53.431
You have a better theory?

02:56.023 --> 02:56.816
Hey, Ryan.

02:58.067 --> 02:59.270
Do you think you
could call dispatch,

02:59.284 --> 03:01.209
see if there any reports
of a violent animal

03:01.210 --> 03:02.027
running around the park?

03:02.028 --> 03:03.387
Like a wolf, a big bad one?

03:04.142 --> 03:04.775
Really?

03:05.846 --> 03:08.039
That is exactly how
I pictured her.

03:08.040 --> 03:08.807
It's freaky.

03:09.158 --> 03:10.823
My older sister used
to read me that story.

03:11.064 --> 03:13.391
Okay, when you're done reliving
your childhood memories,

03:13.392 --> 03:14.937
do you also think that you
could canvass the area

03:14.938 --> 03:16.904
for witnesses and anyone
that might know her name?

03:17.241 --> 03:19.789
And I bet you it's not gonna
be little Red Riding Hood.

03:19.877 --> 03:20.476
On it.

03:22.359 --> 03:23.559
"'All the better
to eat you with.

03:23.802 --> 03:25.729
"No sooner had the
wolf said these words

03:25.981 --> 03:27.460
"when he leaped up
and gobbled down

03:27.461 --> 03:28.930
poor little Red Riding Hood."

03:29.208 --> 03:30.915
Well, the good news is,
the wolf can talk.

03:30.916 --> 03:33.082
So if we can find him, we might
be able to get a confession.

03:33.083 --> 03:34.379
Yeah, except in the
original story,

03:34.380 --> 03:37.116
the wolf doesn't kill
little Red Riding Hood.

03:37.117 --> 03:39.314
The huntsman cuts her out
of the wolf's stomach,

03:39.315 --> 03:40.514
and then she kills the wolf.

03:40.676 --> 03:42.086
Someone's a Brothers Grimm fan.

03:42.301 --> 03:43.942
Oh, yeah.
They didn't sugarcoat it.

03:43.943 --> 03:45.212
They understood that fairy tales

03:45.213 --> 03:46.511
are pretty much horror stories.

03:46.512 --> 03:48.976
Exactly, which is why
we all need them

03:48.977 --> 03:50.178
to grapple with the unknown,

03:50.179 --> 03:52.082
which is why they tap
into our primal fears,

03:52.083 --> 03:55.096
like being alone in the woods
or getting eaten by monsters.

03:55.097 --> 03:57.305
They're not horror stories.
They're life lessons.

03:57.306 --> 03:59.324
If you do the rit thing, you get
to live happily ever after.

03:59.338 --> 04:00.539
But only in fairy tales.

04:00.575 --> 04:02.382
Speaking of fairy tales,
turns out that our victim

04:02.383 --> 04:03.682
really was Red Riding Hood.

04:03.829 --> 04:05.602
Are you drinking
Castle's kool-aid now?

04:05.806 --> 04:07.401
No, I mean that she was

04:09.390 --> 04:10.355
it said so right on the label.

04:10.455 --> 04:11.823
Oh, okay.
So then why was she wearing it

04:11.824 --> 04:13.140
in the middle of the
woods at night?

04:13.605 --> 04:14.587
On her way to
grandmother's house?

04:14.739 --> 04:15.924
Mm. I doubt it.

04:16.192 --> 04:17.476
Her grandmother lives
in Tallahassee.

04:17.714 --> 04:18.865
Oh, great. So you got an ID ?

04:18.884 --> 04:20.762
Yeah. Her prints popped
in the DMV database.

04:20.762 --> 04:21.819
Her name's Amy Morgan.

04:21.831 --> 04:23.213
Her sister Leslie's
on her way in.

04:24.072 --> 04:24.939
I don't understand.

04:25.003 --> 04:27.558
Are you saying Amy was attacked
by some kind of animal?

04:27.666 --> 04:30.007
Do either of you have any
idea why she was in the park?

04:30.512 --> 04:32.534
Amy never went there.
She didn't have time.

04:32.535 --> 04:33.357
She was too busy.

04:34.087 --> 04:34.778
Doing what?

04:35.325 --> 04:37.891
Sh-she was an attorney
for Sampson-Briggs

04:37.962 --> 04:38.635
litigation.

04:38.636 --> 04:40.809
They worked her, like, a
hundred hours a week.

04:40.876 --> 04:41.851
Did she have a boyfriend,

04:41.876 --> 04:43.554
anyone that she would've
been with last night?

04:43.828 --> 04:44.709
Amy's single.

04:45.552 --> 04:46.497
She lives alone.

04:47.411 --> 04:49.385
Um... she's very driven.

04:51.029 --> 04:51.641
Was.

04:52.168 --> 04:53.140
She was.

04:54.804 --> 04:56.511
Do either of you know why
she would be wearing this?

05:01.045 --> 05:02.021
What is it, a cape?

05:02.663 --> 05:03.982
It's a Red Riding Hood cloak.

05:04.884 --> 05:05.816
She was wearing that?

05:07.794 --> 05:09.101
I know Amy's closet.

05:09.471 --> 05:10.485
This was not hers.

05:10.727 --> 05:12.769
I mean, even her
sweatpants were Prada.

05:12.799 --> 05:14.263
Well, maybe she was
going to a party.

05:14.264 --> 05:15.608
Did she mention any parties?

05:15.828 --> 05:18.124
I'm telling you, she would
never wear a thing like this.

05:18.788 --> 05:20.804
Leslie, did your
sister ever tell you

05:20.805 --> 05:24.709
about anything unusual going on
at work or in her personal life?

05:24.848 --> 05:25.548
I don't know.

05:26.542 --> 05:28.148
I hadn't heard
from her all week.

05:28.569 --> 05:29.883
And was that out
of the ordinary?

05:30.243 --> 05:32.470
Yes.
We usually talked every day,

05:32.471 --> 05:34.722
and when she didn't
call, I just assumed

05:34.723 --> 05:36.599
she was busy with a case
or something, but...

05:37.971 --> 05:39.584
maybe there was something
else going on.

05:41.798 --> 05:42.356
Okay, bye.

05:43.287 --> 05:45.557
Hey. Thank you.
So that was Ryan.

05:46.613 --> 05:48.501
He just left animal
control, and there was

05:48.547 --> 05:51.176
only one recent report of an
animal loose in the park--

05:51.824 --> 05:53.532
a Beagle named Fred.

05:54.310 --> 05:56.371
Well, either Fred is
one vicious Beagle

05:56.372 --> 05:58.065
or this mystery has
just deepened.

05:58.641 --> 06:00.497
How does a high-powered lawyer

06:01.221 --> 06:03.463
end up dead in a Red
Riding Hood costume?

06:06.806 --> 06:09.676
Amy worked long hours under
high pressure, right?

06:10.276 --> 06:12.260
What if she had a secret
way of letting off steam

06:12.261 --> 06:13.666
that even her sister
didn't know about?

06:14.707 --> 06:15.313
Like what?

06:15.693 --> 06:19.223
There's this whole adult
role-playing subculture

06:19.323 --> 06:21.267
obsessed with fairy tales.

06:22.371 --> 06:24.867
No, not that kind
of adult role play,

06:24.868 --> 06:26.596
although, there
is that one, too.

06:26.731 --> 06:27.939
And you know this how?

06:28.590 --> 06:29.566
Did a little research.

06:31.425 --> 06:32.269
Bo peep.

06:33.027 --> 06:33.886
Anyway, these people

06:33.887 --> 06:35.977
get dressed in the outfits,
they play the characters,

06:35.978 --> 06:37.742
they even reenact the stories.

06:37.791 --> 06:39.222
Maybe that's what Amy was doing

06:39.223 --> 06:41.649
when everything went horribly
and tragically wrong.

06:42.245 --> 06:44.385
Castle, that is a
surprisingly reasonable

06:44.386 --> 06:45.542
and grounded theory.

06:45.732 --> 06:46.379
Yeah.

06:47.442 --> 06:49.138
Frankly, I'm a little
disappointed in myself.

06:49.731 --> 06:50.645
We all are, bro.

06:51.241 --> 06:53.127
So I was going over
Amy'financials

06:53.128 --> 06:54.552
for any unusual activity.

06:54.728 --> 06:58.619
4 days ago, she took out $50,605

06:58.698 --> 07:00.202
from her savings, all in cash.

07:00.679 --> 07:02.721
$50,605?

07:02.722 --> 07:05.595
That's an odd amount for a
withdrawal, especially in cash.

07:05.596 --> 07:06.484
Yeah, not only that,

07:06.672 --> 07:08.529
but the 50k, it's not
in her apartment,

07:08.530 --> 07:10.100
and I can't tie it to
any recent purchases.

07:10.240 --> 07:11.090
Contact her bank.

07:11.091 --> 07:12.608
See if they know why she
made that withdrawal.

07:12.609 --> 07:13.286
As you wish.

07:14.970 --> 07:16.198
Oh, Lanie's got news for us.

07:16.424 --> 07:17.727
Oh, I've got news, all right,

07:17.728 --> 07:19.062
but I'm not sure
you're gonna like it.

07:19.321 --> 07:21.128
I found hairs like this one

07:21.129 --> 07:22.863
in a wound on the victim's arm.

07:22.864 --> 07:24.778
It didn't come from
her, so I ran DNA.

07:25.214 --> 07:25.942
Did we get a match?

07:26.050 --> 07:28.206
The hair isn't human.
It's wolf hair.

07:28.405 --> 07:29.071
Ooh.

07:29.261 --> 07:31.344
Simmer down, Castle.
I'm not done with the story.

07:31.355 --> 07:33.525
Sorry. What's the rest of it?

07:33.526 --> 07:35.875
Well, from the depth and
the length of the gashes,

07:35.876 --> 07:38.513
it looks like the marks
were made by only one claw.

07:39.879 --> 07:40.864
A one-legged wolf?

07:41.336 --> 07:42.591
I don't think it's
a wolf at all.

07:42.980 --> 07:44.053
But the hair and the claw?

07:44.054 --> 07:46.104
The killer wanted us
to think it was a wolf

07:46.105 --> 07:46.871
to throw us off.

07:46.872 --> 07:48.683
Which would explain why
there are no bite marks

07:48.684 --> 07:49.407
on the body.

07:53.944 --> 07:55.639
So then what's the
real cause of death?

07:55.954 --> 07:57.829
Well, I found two
fresh needle marks,

07:57.830 --> 07:58.951
both on the victim's back,

07:58.952 --> 08:00.849
so she didn't put.

08:01.001 --> 08:01.998
So she was drugged?

08:04.517 --> 08:05.606
No, but tox results

08:05.607 --> 08:07.488
turned up ketamine
and oxycodone.

08:07.489 --> 08:09.979
I'm thinking our guy sedated
her with the ketamine

08:09.980 --> 08:11.365
then dressed her in the costume,

08:11.608 --> 08:13.223
but the dose didn't
quite knock her out.

08:13.224 --> 08:14.736
So she tried to run
away from her killer...

08:14.854 --> 08:15.892
And when he caught her,

08:16.214 --> 08:18.742
he dosed her with oxy,
and it was lights out.

08:20.193 --> 08:21.992
The drugs, the claw--

08:22.096 --> 08:24.804
this is murder, planned
and premeditated.

08:24.805 --> 08:27.139
I mean, the killer
staged the crime scene

08:27.228 --> 08:29.358
to evoke images of
little Red Riding Hood.

08:29.359 --> 08:30.449
Yeah, but why would he do that?

08:30.665 --> 08:32.082
Well, I'm less
concerned about why.

08:32.083 --> 08:34.145
What I'm wondering is who.

08:34.792 --> 08:36.933
So the killer must have
lured Amy into the park.

08:37.832 --> 08:39.620
Which means he's someone
that she knew and trusted.

08:39.693 --> 08:41.624
Yeah, like Red Riding Hood
trusted her cute little granny.

08:41.625 --> 08:44.083
Yeah. Ryan, what did Amy's
coworkers tell you?

08:44.085 --> 08:46.019
Uh, that, uh, she definitely

08:46.020 --> 08:46.932
wasn't herself lately.

08:46.946 --> 08:49.346
Said she'd been acting
agitated since she missed

08:49.347 --> 08:51.505
a mandatory 1:00 staff
meeting last Friday.

08:51.506 --> 08:52.735
Said it was for
personal reasons.

08:52.736 --> 08:55.047
That's the same time that Amy
stopped calling her sister.

08:55.077 --> 08:56.840
Ryan, can you look into her
e-mails and phone calls?

08:56.841 --> 08:58.126
I want to know what was
going on with her.

08:58.173 --> 08:58.787
Yep.

08:59.566 --> 09:00.189
Yo, Beckett.

09:00.656 --> 09:01.696
There's something
you need to see.

09:05.448 --> 09:06.246
Right over there.

09:10.213 --> 09:11.540
Is that what I think
it is in her hand?

09:12.333 --> 09:13.314
A poisoned apple.

09:22.054 --> 09:22.857
She's Snow White.

09:23.268 --> 09:24.113
It looks like we've got

09:24.114 --> 09:25.708
a fairy-tale killer
on our hands.

09:42.429 --> 09:43.137
Yo, Beckett.

09:44.182 --> 09:44.822
Excuse me.

09:45.491 --> 09:47.087
Her medicalert bracelet
got us an ID.

09:47.403 --> 09:48.923
She's Kristina Curtis, 25.

09:49.072 --> 09:50.200
Lives on the Upper East Side.

09:50.201 --> 09:51.029
Does she have next of kin?

09:51.030 --> 09:53.090
Yeah, her husband.
His name's Noah Curtis.

09:53.091 --> 09:54.980
Okay, I need you guys to
take point on the interview.

09:54.981 --> 09:56.293
Find out what he
knows about this,

09:56.294 --> 09:58.617
and let's see if Kristina was
connected to the other victim.

09:58.618 --> 10:00.055
You know, if our killer's
dressing his victims

10:00.056 --> 10:00.856
in these costumes,

10:01.548 --> 10:03.194
I bet we can ID
the manufacturer

10:03.195 --> 10:04.336
and find out where he got 'em.

10:04.379 --> 10:05.518
That's a good idea.
You run with it.

10:07.171 --> 10:08.834
Huh, here it is. "White as snow,

10:08.924 --> 10:10.576
red as blood, black as ebony."

10:10.577 --> 10:12.046
This guy is quoting directly

10:12.047 --> 10:13.860
from Grimm's original
"Snow White."

10:13.880 --> 10:16.390
So our victims aren't
reenacting the fairy tales,

10:16.940 --> 10:17.789
the killer is.

10:18.333 --> 10:20.436
Only this woman didn't die
from a poisoned apple.

10:20.437 --> 10:23.036
She has the same injection
marks as Amy Morgan.

10:23.440 --> 10:24.420
Do you have time of death?

10:24.709 --> 10:26.491
Between 5:00 and 7:00 am this morning.

10:26.606 --> 10:28.099
So he kills Red Riding Hood,

10:28.613 --> 10:30.492
then six hours later,
he strikes again?

10:30.493 --> 10:31.561
That's a pretty
quick turnaround.

10:31.566 --> 10:33.149
It's all the markings
of a serial killer.

10:33.362 --> 10:34.230
Yeah, but technically,

10:34.406 --> 10:36.342
you have to murder three
times to be a serial killer.

10:36.379 --> 10:37.927
Yeah, well, let's make
sure he never gets there.

10:39.792 --> 10:41.536
When did you last see
your wife, Mr. Curtis?

10:42.047 --> 10:43.577
Just before 5:00 am, when she--

10:43.868 --> 10:45.021
she left for her jog.

10:45.078 --> 10:46.510
She--she gave me
a kiss good-bye.

10:47.029 --> 10:48.085
That was the last
time I saw her.

10:49.287 --> 10:51.405
I-I-I can't-- I can't
believe she's gone.

10:52.574 --> 10:54.362
Mr. Curtis, this run she took,

10:54.363 --> 10:55.400
who else knew she was going?

10:55.750 --> 10:57.224
Other joggers in
the park, I guess.

10:57.943 --> 11:00.550
She--she went every morning,
even in the snow.

11:00.737 --> 11:01.900
She--she never missed a day.

11:02.634 --> 11:04.323
She have problems with any
of the other joggers?

11:04.410 --> 11:05.857
No, not that she told me.

11:06.498 --> 11:08.378
Did she ever mention being
followed or watched?

11:08.719 --> 11:10.416
Are you saying someone
was stalking her?

11:10.885 --> 11:12.135
Under the circumstances,

11:12.136 --> 11:14.140
this doesn't look
like a random attack.

11:14.141 --> 11:15.369
What did your wife
do for a living?

11:16.785 --> 11:17.731
She owned an art gallery

11:17.732 --> 11:18.586
on Fifth Avenue.

11:21.606 --> 11:22.583
Did you ever see
this woman before

11:23.980 --> 11:25.240
or heard the name Amy Morgan?

11:25.585 --> 11:27.078
No, I don't think so.
Why? Who is she?

11:27.658 --> 11:28.952
She's another victim,
Mr. Curtis.

11:30.012 --> 11:31.662
Could she be an
acquaintance of Kristina's?

11:36.423 --> 11:38.217
I don't recognize her.
I'm sorry.

11:38.810 --> 11:41.619
Did you notice anything unusual
about Kristina lately,

11:41.620 --> 11:44.022
her--her state of mind, maybe
something she said or did?

11:45.494 --> 11:47.102
There was something
strange last week.

11:48.553 --> 11:50.154
We were supposed to
have lunch on Friday.

11:50.155 --> 11:51.374
But she didn't show.

11:51.478 --> 11:54.180
She called later to say she
went to the art gallery

11:54.192 --> 11:55.465
for a last-minute emergency.

11:55.848 --> 11:57.681
Last Friday?
Was your lunch at 1:00 pm?

11:58.868 --> 11:59.858
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

12:00.990 --> 12:01.747
W-why?

12:05.417 --> 12:06.475
Kristina lied to her husband

12:06.710 --> 12:08.343
about why she
missed their lunch.

12:08.730 --> 12:10.354
She wasn't at the art
gallery last Friday.

12:10.355 --> 12:11.371
They don't know where she was.

12:11.380 --> 12:13.944
Okay, so both of our victims
were unaccounted for

12:13.945 --> 12:17.195
at exactly the same time shortly
before they got killed.

12:17.413 --> 12:18.383
So where did they go?

12:18.640 --> 12:20.061
Yeah, still working on it.
Excuse me.

12:20.062 --> 12:20.856
Yeah, Ryan here.

12:21.400 --> 12:22.474
Maybe they knew each other.

12:22.561 --> 12:24.306
No, their family said they
didn't know each other.

12:24.307 --> 12:26.051
They had completely
different careers,

12:26.052 --> 12:27.451
and they lived in
different parts of town.

12:28.107 --> 12:30.461
It seems like their lives
never really intersected.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.761
Mm, until they both died at
the hand of the same killer.

12:32.762 --> 12:36.004
So why these two women
and why fairy tales?

12:36.005 --> 12:38.235
Did the killer have some
kind of a random obsession

12:38.236 --> 12:41.135
or was there a deeper
meaning behind all of it?

12:41.136 --> 12:42.875
Well, I think he's trying to
tell a story with these bodies.

12:42.876 --> 12:44.140
I just don't know
what it is yet.

12:44.378 --> 12:45.247
Maybe it's about money.

12:45.484 --> 12:47.506
Turns out Kristina raided
her trust account.

12:47.507 --> 12:48.562
Guess how much she took out?

12:49.241 --> 12:51.672
$50,605.

12:52.418 --> 12:54.587
So both victims
go AWOL on Friday

12:54.588 --> 12:56.529
and both pull out the exact
same amount of cash.

12:56.530 --> 12:57.336
That's not a coincidence.

12:57.337 --> 12:58.441
That is a connection.

12:58.442 --> 12:59.910
Can you get ahold of
Kristina's family,

12:59.911 --> 13:01.357
see if they know why she might
have needed that money?

13:01.358 --> 13:02.461
Yeah, I'll reach out
to the husband.

13:02.492 --> 13:03.983
Thanks.
Ryan, what did you find out?

13:04.122 --> 13:06.138
I think I might have found
the pathway to our killer.

13:06.307 --> 13:08.189
Those Snow White and Red
Riding Hood outfits--

13:08.228 --> 13:09.656
they were made by the
same manufacturer.

13:09.750 --> 13:10.735
Do you know where
they were sold?

13:10.859 --> 13:12.834
I'm still waiting for
a list of stores

13:12.835 --> 13:15.137
that carry the costumes, both
online and brick and mortar.

13:15.138 --> 13:16.345
We should have some
answers by the morning.

13:20.251 --> 13:21.575
Move that chair over there.

13:23.644 --> 13:24.752
We could use your help.

13:24.825 --> 13:26.415
Moving my furniture where
I don't want it to go?

13:26.416 --> 13:27.407
It's just temporary.

13:27.563 --> 13:29.866
We're having a staged
reading of my one-woman show,

13:29.867 --> 13:30.836
here, tomorrow night.

13:30.840 --> 13:32.848
Ah, it's too bad you don't
have an acting studio

13:32.881 --> 13:34.146
to do this kind of thing in.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.900
Oh, wait. You do.

13:36.064 --> 13:38.195
The little Black Box Theater
is not right for this, dear.

13:38.196 --> 13:39.573
It needs something
much more intimate.

13:39.582 --> 13:41.051
It'll be very avant-garde.

13:41.457 --> 13:42.260
Exactly.

13:42.959 --> 13:45.548
Now I think this chair
should be here, Marcus.

13:45.549 --> 13:47.372
I want to create a...

13:47.373 --> 13:48.560
Sweetie, couldn't you
have done something

13:48.561 --> 13:49.476
to discourage this?

13:49.500 --> 13:52.168
I tried, dad, but she
made me stage mager.

13:52.566 --> 13:53.927
Look, it's not as
bad as you think.

13:54.036 --> 13:55.712
- Just 20 or 30 people...
- Ah--

13:55.713 --> 13:58.480
And we'll put everything back.
This play means a lot to gram,

13:58.546 --> 14:00.160
and it's actually really good.

14:01.052 --> 14:03.067
Now I understand things about
her I never did before,

14:04.398 --> 14:05.324
and about you, too.

14:07.514 --> 14:08.401
About me?

14:08.864 --> 14:09.484
No, no, no, no.

14:09.485 --> 14:11.399
This--this space
needs to be bigger.

14:11.400 --> 14:12.519
An actor needs space.

14:12.637 --> 14:14.431
"Richard always had
a dark imagination.

14:14.432 --> 14:16.587
"He was destined either
to become a serial killer

14:16.588 --> 14:18.344
or a mystery writer."
Mother, really?

14:18.345 --> 14:20.353
Oh, it's just a
slight exaggeration.

14:20.354 --> 14:22.781
And according to this, you're
responsible for launching

14:22.782 --> 14:23.783
my writing career by...

14:25.509 --> 14:26.777
You slept with my
first publisher?

14:26.854 --> 14:28.407
Mr. Castle, I'm sure your talent

14:28.408 --> 14:29.767
would've gotten you
there eventually.

14:29.768 --> 14:32.014
My talent did get me there.

14:32.480 --> 14:34.189
I didn't get published
because of her.

14:34.275 --> 14:37.258
Technically, I slept with him
after your book was out.

14:37.532 --> 14:39.427
This is just to be
more salacious.

14:40.579 --> 14:42.061
Wasn't he practically my age?

14:42.346 --> 14:44.080
Honey, you know I've
always loved younger men.

14:44.081 --> 14:46.339
They have so much energy,
enough to keep up with me...

14:46.821 --> 14:47.853
most of the time.

14:48.940 --> 14:49.677
I'm gonna...

14:50.051 --> 14:51.649
erase that image from my mind

14:51.738 --> 14:52.735
with a bottle of scotch.

14:53.154 --> 14:54.139
Oh, darling,

14:54.357 --> 14:56.564
I invited Beckett to the
reading tomorrow night,

14:56.565 --> 14:58.714
so you two might want
to make a date of it.

15:01.402 --> 15:02.214
What was I supposed to do,

15:02.215 --> 15:03.038
say no?

15:03.039 --> 15:04.182
Yes.

15:04.368 --> 15:06.585
Why are you so against
your mom's play?

15:06.586 --> 15:08.384
Because she's rewriting history--

15:08.385 --> 15:09.255
my history.

15:09.256 --> 15:11.466
Trust me, I lived through it.

15:11.467 --> 15:14.346
She's making it sound like it's
her own personal fairy tale.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.481
Oh, so you don't like
it when someone writes

15:16.482 --> 15:18.536
their own version of your life?

15:18.736 --> 15:19.792
Interesting.

15:19.793 --> 15:21.560
Okay, are you referring
to the Nikki Heat books?

15:21.561 --> 15:22.936
Because this is
completely different.

15:22.937 --> 15:23.776
How is it different?

15:23.777 --> 15:26.328
Well, for one thing,
I'm not claiming

15:26.329 --> 15:27.920
that what I write
is actually true.

15:27.921 --> 15:29.384
Well, I don't think
she is either.

15:29.385 --> 15:31.128
Come on, Castle, you
said so yourself,

15:31.129 --> 15:33.824
everyone needs a fairy tale.

15:34.025 --> 15:35.911
What's the harm in letting
your mom have one of her own?

15:35.912 --> 15:37.776
Okay, let's--let's
change the subject

15:37.777 --> 15:39.969
to something less likely
to give me an ulcer.

15:40.553 --> 15:43.608
How about that
mysterious $50,605?

15:43.609 --> 15:44.416
Okay.

15:44.417 --> 15:47.152
Um, well, we talked to
pretty much everyone

15:47.153 --> 15:48.496
close to Amy and Kristina,

15:48.497 --> 15:51.192
and no one seems to know why
they pulled out that money.

15:51.209 --> 15:52.975
What about where they were
at 1:00 pm on Friday?

15:52.976 --> 15:54.913
Nothing popped on Amy's e-mail

15:55.473 --> 15:56.511
or phone calls,

15:56.512 --> 15:59.072
and the techs are still going
through Kristina's computer.

15:59.073 --> 15:59.888
Hey, guys.

15:59.889 --> 16:01.120
I think we might
have caught a break.

16:01.121 --> 16:03.240
We tracked down that web
site that sold the costumes.

16:03.241 --> 16:05.055
The Red Riding Hood cloak
and the Snow White dress

16:05.056 --> 16:06.820
worn by our victims were
shipped out eight days ago.

16:06.821 --> 16:08.143
To whom? Do you have a name?

16:08.144 --> 16:09.383
Yeah, Jamie Isaacson.

16:09.384 --> 16:10.864
Lives at 11th Street
and 7th Avenue.

16:10.865 --> 16:12.201
And he didn't just
order two costumes.

16:12.202 --> 16:13.794
There was a third in
the shipment as well,

16:13.795 --> 16:14.905
for Sleeping Beauty.

16:14.906 --> 16:16.241
Sleeping Beauty?

16:16.874 --> 16:18.024
He's gonna kill again.

16:18.025 --> 16:19.682
Not if we get to him first.

16:31.463 --> 16:33.489
Jamie Isaacson, NYPD.

16:33.490 --> 16:34.614
Open up.

16:36.613 --> 16:37.982
- Kick it.
- Yeah.

16:38.438 --> 16:40.551
Go, go, go, go!

16:45.113 --> 16:46.120
Room clear.

16:46.329 --> 16:47.440
Room clear.

16:53.098 --> 16:54.391
All these freaky dolls--

16:54.429 --> 16:56.238
just how I pictured
this guy's lair.

16:58.191 --> 16:58.941
Ever since Chuck

16:58.942 --> 17:00.656
I haven't been able
to look at a doll.

17:01.215 --> 17:02.422
Detectives!

17:10.750 --> 17:13.671
Did you have to
knock down my door?

17:13.934 --> 17:15.262
Ma'am, we announced ourselves.

17:15.262 --> 17:16.767
I was coming.

17:17.367 --> 17:20.247
I don't move as
fast as I used to.

17:20.349 --> 17:22.836
Ma'am, do you know
a Jamie Isaacson?

17:22.837 --> 17:25.886
Of course I know a
Jamie Isaacson.

17:27.012 --> 17:29.519
I'm Jamie Isaacson.

17:30.726 --> 17:32.219
Y--

17:32.678 --> 17:35.328
Candy? It's very good.

17:35.329 --> 17:36.542
No, thanks.

17:36.767 --> 17:38.885
Mrs. Isaacson, does
anyone else live here?

17:38.886 --> 17:41.862
No, dearie, nobody
else lives here,

17:41.863 --> 17:43.709
just me and my friends.

17:45.814 --> 17:47.405
Do you have any family
who checks on you,

17:47.406 --> 17:48.542
health care workers?

17:48.543 --> 17:51.139
Other more, um, human friends?

17:51.535 --> 17:54.294
Well, mostly, it's just us. Why?

17:54.830 --> 17:56.692
Did you receive a package
in the mail last week,

17:56.693 --> 17:57.582
Mrs. Isaacson?

17:57.583 --> 18:00.158
Oh, I receive packages
all the time.

18:00.159 --> 18:03.576
Molly and Abigail
are new arrivals.

18:03.702 --> 18:05.046
Aren't they gorgeous?

18:05.047 --> 18:06.429
Yes, they are.

18:06.430 --> 18:08.670
What about a delivery
of fairy-tale costumes?

18:08.671 --> 18:10.638
Fairy-tale costumes?

18:10.639 --> 18:11.764
According to our records,

18:11.765 --> 18:14.213
you ordered three from
a web site last week.

18:14.214 --> 18:15.843
Well, that's just ridiculous.

18:15.844 --> 18:18.462
What would I do with
fairy-tale costumes?

18:18.463 --> 18:19.687
Can't imagine.

18:19.989 --> 18:21.862
So you didn't order any
costumes from the internet?

18:21.863 --> 18:24.117
Do I look like someone
who's in the habit

18:24.118 --> 18:25.488
of wasting money?

18:25.489 --> 18:27.311
I-I'm on a fixed income.

18:27.478 --> 18:29.910
Well, I happened to notice
that you don't have

18:29.911 --> 18:31.157
a doorman for this building.

18:31.158 --> 18:32.766
So where are your packages left?

18:32.807 --> 18:34.701
By the mailbox in the lobby.

18:34.702 --> 18:36.686
Mrs. Isaacson,

18:36.687 --> 18:39.725
did you notice any,
uh, unusual charges

18:39.726 --> 18:41.292
on your credit card?

18:41.293 --> 18:42.965
Anyone have access to it?

18:42.966 --> 18:45.711
Well, not unless they're
digging for gold.

18:46.621 --> 18:48.879
Can't be too safe these days.

18:49.942 --> 18:51.134
Yeah.

18:51.174 --> 18:53.620
So, UPS confirms that
a package of costumes

18:53.621 --> 18:54.636
was dropped off

18:54.637 --> 18:57.358
at Mrs. Isaacson's lobby,
but nobody signed for it,

18:57.359 --> 18:58.918
per buyer's instructions.

18:58.919 --> 19:00.276
Here's some more bad news--

19:00.277 --> 19:02.630
no security cameras inside
the lobby or outside.

19:02.631 --> 19:04.028
And from what we could tell,

19:04.029 --> 19:05.389
the building's not
terribly secure.

19:05.390 --> 19:06.438
Our killer probably knew that.

19:06.439 --> 19:07.950
That's why he used it
as a delivery drop.

19:07.951 --> 19:09.597
Well, if he knew the old
lady's credit card number,

19:09.598 --> 19:10.557
maybe he knew her.

19:10.558 --> 19:12.462
Could be. Could be he just found

19:12.463 --> 19:13.877
her credit card
statements in the trash.

19:13.878 --> 19:15.150
It's old school, but
it's effective.

19:15.151 --> 19:16.293
You guys, for all we know,

19:16.294 --> 19:18.533
he's targeting Sleeping
Beauty as we speak.

19:18.534 --> 19:20.679
Yo. I got something.

19:20.901 --> 19:23.694
That missing hour of Kristina's
at lunch time last Friday?

19:23.727 --> 19:27.422
Tech found a map search on her
tablet that day at 12:50 pm--

19:27.423 --> 19:28.926
walking directions
to Glassman's Cafe

19:28.927 --> 19:29.893
on the Upper West Side.

19:29.894 --> 19:31.174
Okay, great.
You guys go to the cafe.

19:31.175 --> 19:32.990
See if you can figure out
who she was meeting with.

19:32.991 --> 19:33.990
On it.

19:33.991 --> 19:35.925
In the meantime, I'm gonna
get ahold of uniforms

19:35.926 --> 19:38.021
and ask them to double
foot patrols in parks.

19:38.022 --> 19:40.118
Only he's not gonna strike
at a park this time.

19:40.358 --> 19:42.257
In the Grimm stories, Red
Riding Hood and Snow White

19:42.258 --> 19:43.759
were found in the woods,

19:43.760 --> 19:45.208
but Sleeping Beauty...

19:45.209 --> 19:46.695
Was found in her bedroom.

19:46.696 --> 19:47.831
Right.

19:48.145 --> 19:50.359
Great. So that narrows it down
to several million apartments,

19:50.360 --> 19:52.072
and that is just in Manhattan.

19:52.073 --> 19:53.601
It doesn't make sense.

19:54.487 --> 19:56.223
What doesn't make any sense?

19:56.224 --> 19:57.448
His motive.

19:57.865 --> 19:59.359
All serial killers
are expressing

19:59.360 --> 20:01.040
some psychological impulse.

20:01.041 --> 20:02.447
Somewhere deep down,

20:02.676 --> 20:05.214
there's a twistelogic
to their insanity.

20:05.215 --> 20:06.231
Okay. Keep going.

20:06.232 --> 20:07.872
In the original Grimm's tales,

20:07.873 --> 20:10.315
Red Riding Hood, Snow
White, Sleeping Beauty--

20:10.316 --> 20:11.727
they all end up near death,

20:11.728 --> 20:13.553
but were saved at
the last minute.

20:14.377 --> 20:15.231
It's like he's trying

20:15.232 --> 20:17.050
to take away our
victims' happy endings.

20:17.051 --> 20:20.128
Right. Not only that, but he
could've ordered any costume,

20:20.129 --> 20:21.351
but he picked these.

20:21.352 --> 20:22.447
He took great care
in the details--

20:22.448 --> 20:24.313
the wolf's claw, the apple.

20:24.793 --> 20:27.337
He chose these
characters for a reason.

20:28.105 --> 20:29.440
He chose these women
for a reason.

20:29.441 --> 20:31.833
I just...
haven't figured it out yet.

20:31.920 --> 20:34.120
Well, whatever it is,
it has to be connected

20:34.121 --> 20:35.960
to the cash that they withdrew.

20:35.961 --> 20:37.944
Maybe he's choosing women
with healthy bank accounts.

20:37.945 --> 20:39.000
Bank.

20:39.001 --> 20:39.640
Sorry?

20:39.641 --> 20:42.184
Kristina and Amy both withdrew
the same amount of money.

20:42.185 --> 20:44.376
Maybe our Sleeping
Beauty did as well.

20:45.080 --> 20:46.544
The IRS requires banks

20:46.545 --> 20:48.927
to report any transactions
over $10,000,

20:48.928 --> 20:50.961
- so they would have a record of it.
- Exactly.

20:51.104 --> 20:52.624
Yeah, she was here.

20:52.697 --> 20:54.359
It was last Friday,
during the lunch rush,

20:54.360 --> 20:56.615
right after I spilled
ketchup on my new jeans.

20:56.616 --> 20:59.143
They were 70% off--
amazing sale.

20:59.144 --> 21:00.399
Was she by herself?

21:00.400 --> 21:02.184
No, it was a party of three.

21:02.209 --> 21:04.518
Three? Do you remember
who else she was with?

21:04.519 --> 21:05.824
Two other women.

21:06.343 --> 21:08.287
I've never been questioned
by cops before.

21:08.288 --> 21:09.687
You mind if I tweet about this?

21:09.688 --> 21:11.802
Uh, yeah, yes, we-- we do mind.

21:12.929 --> 21:14.057
This one of the women?

21:15.145 --> 21:16.240
Yeah.

21:16.537 --> 21:18.025
Are they criminals or something?

21:18.026 --> 21:20.400
'Cause I was getting more
of an Upper East Side vibe.

21:20.401 --> 21:22.705
No, but this third woman
may be in danger,

21:22.706 --> 21:24.817
so we need to identify her
as soon as possible.

21:24.919 --> 21:26.503
Do you remember if she maybe
paid with a credit card,

21:26.504 --> 21:27.480
maybe you caught her name?

21:27.481 --> 21:28.900
Nope. They paid cash.

21:28.901 --> 21:31.472
Was anyone else
with them, a-a man?

21:31.473 --> 21:32.594
No.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.216
Did you notice anyone
watching them?

21:34.217 --> 21:35.296
Some of the other customers,

21:35.297 --> 21:37.143
- but only because they were arguing.
- About what?

21:37.144 --> 21:39.135
I don't know.
I kind of tried to eavesdrop,

21:39.136 --> 21:40.473
but every time I
went over there,

21:40.474 --> 21:41.897
they gave me the death stare.

21:41.898 --> 21:43.400
Whatever they were
talking about,

21:43.401 --> 21:44.923
they didn't want me to hear.

21:45.177 --> 21:46.936
Okay, so the IRS search

21:46.937 --> 21:48.424
reveals ten different
cash transactions

21:48.425 --> 21:51.753
between $50,000 and
$60,000 for that day.

21:51.754 --> 21:54.535
Two belong to our Red
Riding Hood and Snow White.

21:54.536 --> 21:56.682
That leaves us eight.

21:56.801 --> 21:58.871
Five of them were made by males,

21:58.872 --> 22:00.096
leaving...

22:00.289 --> 22:01.441
three women.

22:01.610 --> 22:03.680
Jessica Harper, Charlotte Boyd,

22:03.681 --> 22:05.376
and Dana Wilson.

22:05.377 --> 22:06.840
Well, Harper and Wilson
are in their 50s.

22:06.841 --> 22:08.024
They don't fit the profile.

22:08.025 --> 22:09.335
Which leaves us...

22:09.345 --> 22:10.649
Charlotte Boyd.

22:12.241 --> 22:12.856
Beckett.

22:12.857 --> 22:14.433
Hey, we were able to confirm

22:14.434 --> 22:15.960
that Kristina was
here with Amy Morgan

22:15.961 --> 22:17.672
and a third woman last Friday.

22:17.673 --> 22:19.647
We think she might be our
killer's third target.

22:19.648 --> 22:20.576
We didn't get an ID,

22:20.577 --> 22:22.183
but we did get a pretty
good description.

22:22.184 --> 22:24.784
Let me guess--in her 20s,
brown hair, brown eyes,

22:24.785 --> 22:27.144
- exotic looking.
- Yeah. How'd you know?

22:27.145 --> 22:28.335
Charlotte isn't answering.

22:28.336 --> 22:29.391
Her name's Charlotte Boyd.

22:29.392 --> 22:30.754
Ryan, I'm gonna text
you her address.

22:30.755 --> 22:32.129
Just meet us over there.

23:15.353 --> 23:16.441
Beckett!

23:17.945 --> 23:18.952
Castle?

23:23.768 --> 23:25.632
Call an ambulance.
She's still alive.

23:36.180 --> 23:37.267
Okay, yeah.

23:37.268 --> 23:39.885
Just keep me posted on her status.
Thanks.

23:39.984 --> 23:40.984
So that was the ER.

23:40.985 --> 23:43.617
Charlotte is stable but
still unconscious.

23:43.618 --> 23:44.682
Ketamine and oxycodone?

23:44.683 --> 23:46.585
Yeah, and with that treatment,
her heart could've stopped.

23:46.586 --> 23:48.188
The doctor said we got
there just in time.

23:48.189 --> 23:49.665
Just like in the fairy tale.

23:49.737 --> 23:51.504
So, what, you're
Prince Charming now?

23:51.505 --> 23:52.842
Well, if the shoe fits...

23:53.154 --> 23:53.674
Nah.

23:53.675 --> 23:55.432
I'm just glad we had
a happy ending.

23:55.433 --> 23:58.233
Well, it won't be a happy
ending until evil is vanquished

23:58.234 --> 23:59.464
and locked in the dungeon.

23:59.465 --> 24:00.601
We're closing in on him.

24:00.602 --> 24:02.049
Yeah, but he's still
a step ahead.

24:02.666 --> 24:05.136
I'm hoping that he left some
kind of evidence behind.

24:05.137 --> 24:06.128
Yo.

24:06.129 --> 24:07.161
We've done a full sweep.

24:07.162 --> 24:09.262
No sign of the $50,605.

24:09.263 --> 24:11.194
A luxury condo and
that much money--

24:11.195 --> 24:12.419
what does this girl
do for a living?

24:12.420 --> 24:13.699
She worked for a
real estate firm

24:13.700 --> 24:14.809
as a high-end broker.

24:14.810 --> 24:17.252
If you didn't have $10 mil to
plunk down on an apartment,

24:17.371 --> 24:18.553
she wasn't your girl.

24:18.554 --> 24:20.181
Okay, so we got three women,

24:20.292 --> 24:22.212
all in their 20s,
all successful,

24:22.319 --> 24:24.234
all have a secret
meeting last Friday

24:24.235 --> 24:27.538
and then pull the exact same
amount of cash out of the bank.

24:27.539 --> 24:29.609
Maybe they were going in
on something, pulling the money.

24:29.610 --> 24:31.296
I think we can safely
rule out lotto tickets.

24:31.297 --> 24:32.697
No, there's gotta be something
that we're missing.

24:34.963 --> 24:36.449
Hey, guys. Look at this.

24:36.602 --> 24:38.642
I found it at the bottom of
one of Charlotte's drawers.

24:38.793 --> 24:40.009
We got our connection.

24:40.937 --> 24:43.336
Amy, Charlotte, and Kristina--

24:43.337 --> 24:44.592
our three victims.

24:44.593 --> 24:46.192
All dressed as
fairy-tale characters.

24:46.193 --> 24:47.616
Yeah, dressed as the
same characters

24:47.617 --> 24:49.307
that our killer dressed them as.

24:49.609 --> 24:50.913
Check out the date.

24:52.193 --> 24:53.601
"05/06/05."

24:53.602 --> 24:54.908
That's seven years ago.

24:54.909 --> 24:57.176
Yeah, it's also the amount
of money they withdrew.

24:57.177 --> 24:59.465
Yeah, 50,605 bucks.

24:59.466 --> 25:01.704
Yeah, and, uh, check
out the back.

25:01.705 --> 25:03.424
"Who's the guiltiest
of them all?

25:03.425 --> 25:06.122
If you pay, you'll live
to see another day."

25:06.649 --> 25:08.112
They were being blackmailed?

25:08.113 --> 25:10.880
Okay, so something
happened on that date

25:10.881 --> 25:11.848
that connects them all.

25:11.849 --> 25:13.416
Something that led
to their murders.

25:13.417 --> 25:15.208
So who's the guy
taking the photo?

25:15.577 --> 25:17.009
Maybe he can tell
us what happened.

25:17.010 --> 25:19.632
CSU only found one set
of prints on the photo--

25:19.633 --> 25:21.393
Charlotte's-- but they
were able to determine

25:21.394 --> 25:23.081
that it was developed
within the last two weeks.

25:23.082 --> 25:23.975
How can they do that?

25:23.976 --> 25:25.136
Well, it's machine processed,

25:25.137 --> 25:26.758
like, you know,
from a drug store?

25:26.759 --> 25:27.945
And there's a control code.

25:27.946 --> 25:31.101
Can we use the code to figure
out where it was processed?

25:31.102 --> 25:32.213
Yeah, already on it.

25:32.214 --> 25:34.095
Hopefully, that'll get us
who ordered the prints.

25:35.183 --> 25:36.774
This photo was taken
seven years ago.

25:36.775 --> 25:38.770
Why is it surfacing now?

25:38.771 --> 25:40.579
Yo. You were right
about the date.

25:40.580 --> 25:41.643
Something did happen that night.

25:41.644 --> 25:42.681
There's even a police report.

25:42.682 --> 25:44.883
I don't suppose the report
IDs our Prince Charming.

25:44.884 --> 25:47.267
Sure does.
His name's Owen Thomas.

25:47.268 --> 25:49.227
But he can't be our suspect.

25:49.485 --> 25:50.275
He's dead.

25:50.276 --> 25:53.211
He was killed 7 years
ago-- May 6, 2005.

25:53.212 --> 25:54.460
5/06/05.

25:54.461 --> 25:55.803
The night that the
photo was taken.

25:55.804 --> 25:57.665
It's also the same night
that Owen attended

25:57.666 --> 25:59.722
an underground rave,
fairy-tale themed.

25:59.723 --> 26:01.652
He was last seen alive at 10:45.

26:01.677 --> 26:04.307
But this picture was
taken at 11:23.

26:04.308 --> 26:05.779
How did he die?

26:05.780 --> 26:07.731
Internal bleeding complicated
with high doses

26:07.732 --> 26:09.523
of ketamine and oxycodone.

26:09.524 --> 26:10.843
That explains our killer's m.o.

26:10.844 --> 26:12.499
Okay, so he's high
on club drugs,

26:12.500 --> 26:14.115
but what caused the
internal bleeding?

26:14.116 --> 26:15.100
A car.

26:15.101 --> 26:16.732
His body was found on
the side of the road.

26:16.733 --> 26:18.508
ME wrote it up as
a hit and run.

26:18.509 --> 26:19.621
There were no witnesses,

26:19.622 --> 26:21.820
so the trail went cold,
they never solved the case.

26:22.294 --> 26:23.627
It's "I know what you
did last summer."

26:23.628 --> 26:24.716
"Who's the guiltiest
of them all?"

26:24.717 --> 26:26.245
The killer thinks that
one of these women

26:26.246 --> 26:27.469
is responsible for his death.

26:27.470 --> 26:28.339
Maybe they are.

26:28.340 --> 26:30.660
This photo proves that they were
the last ones to see him alive,

26:30.661 --> 26:32.701
yet none of them gave
statements to the cops.

26:32.702 --> 26:34.038
But why are the murders
happening now,

26:34.039 --> 26:35.917
- seven years later?
- Well, maybe after all these years,

26:35.918 --> 26:37.405
someone found this photo.

26:37.654 --> 26:40.192
Esposito, can you look into
Owen's family and friends?

26:40.193 --> 26:42.288
Someone might be trying to
get payback for his death.

26:42.289 --> 26:43.205
You got it.

26:43.501 --> 26:44.363
Beckett.

26:44.364 --> 26:45.860
Yeah. We'll be right there.

26:45.919 --> 26:47.532
Sleeping Beauty just woke up.

26:48.971 --> 26:50.044
Charlotte?

26:51.548 --> 26:54.708
I'm detective Beckett.
This is Mr. Castle.

26:55.011 --> 26:57.092
Do you feel well enough to
answer a few questions?

27:00.300 --> 27:01.347
Yeah.

27:02.244 --> 27:04.211
What can you tell us
about the attack?

27:04.947 --> 27:07.539
I was at my computer,

27:07.540 --> 27:09.298
just listening to music,

27:09.299 --> 27:11.498
and... the next thing you know,

27:11.499 --> 27:13.316
I'm being pushed to the floor.

27:13.623 --> 27:14.867
Did you see who did it?

27:16.108 --> 27:16.723
No.

27:16.724 --> 27:18.820
They're saying--they're
saying I was drugged.

27:19.620 --> 27:21.412
Why would someone do this to me?

27:22.580 --> 27:24.523
Charlotte, I think you know why.

27:24.564 --> 27:28.428
All three of you reived
a copy of this photo.

27:30.428 --> 27:32.708
Amy and Kristina weren't
as lucky as you.

27:33.524 --> 27:34.836
They didn't make it.

27:36.836 --> 27:38.076
Oh, my God.

27:38.844 --> 27:41.308
But we did what he asked.
We paid him.

27:42.045 --> 27:43.450
What does he have on you?

27:43.924 --> 27:46.011
What happened to Owen
that night?

27:51.388 --> 27:52.451
Charlotte?

27:54.876 --> 27:56.980
It was just some stupid...

27:58.204 --> 27:59.547
fairy-tale rave.

27:59.548 --> 28:03.219
Um, we were just looking to dance and...
have fun.

28:03.780 --> 28:06.259
And Owen had scored
some "Special K."

28:06.859 --> 28:08.067
That hit is pretty hard,

28:08.068 --> 28:10.107
but Kristina had some
of her mom's oxy

28:10.644 --> 28:12.500
and said it would even us out.

28:12.644 --> 28:14.820
Somehow we ended
up in Amy's car,

28:14.996 --> 28:16.828
and that's where this
picture was taken.

28:18.971 --> 28:21.172
How did Owen end up on
the side of the road?

28:21.468 --> 28:24.153
He was having some seriously
bad hallucinations,

28:24.154 --> 28:25.248
just...

28:25.249 --> 28:27.905
screaming and--and grabbing us.

28:28.041 --> 28:31.112
So we pulled the car over,
and we made him get out.

28:31.113 --> 28:33.513
We just figured, he'd
walk back to the rave.

28:34.225 --> 28:36.124
But it was all over the
news the next morning

28:36.125 --> 28:38.863
that...
that there had been a hit and run

28:38.864 --> 28:40.063
and that he'd been killed.

28:40.064 --> 28:42.018
And why didn't you come forward?

28:42.567 --> 28:44.553
Oh, we were just kids then.

28:45.546 --> 28:47.961
We were scared out of our minds.
You--

28:49.401 --> 28:52.041
you have to understand,
we had a lot to lose.

28:52.594 --> 28:55.297
We came from good families, we'd
been accepted into college,

28:55.298 --> 28:57.619
we... we made a pact

28:57.620 --> 28:58.720
and we said, we--

28:58.721 --> 29:00.857
we wouldn't tell anyone
what happened that night.

29:02.130 --> 29:04.970
And that we'd never
see each other again.

29:07.058 --> 29:08.953
Look, I'm not excusing
how we handled it.

29:08.954 --> 29:11.047
We were... stupid,

29:11.048 --> 29:14.129
but... we didn't do anything.

29:14.611 --> 29:16.390
Well, someone thinks you did.

29:18.070 --> 29:19.558
What did you do with the money?

29:21.191 --> 29:24.003
The note said to put
it in a dumpster

29:24.004 --> 29:25.743
at Bleecker and Thompson.

29:26.452 --> 29:28.278
We didn't want some scandal
messing up our lives,

29:28.279 --> 29:29.469
so we did it.

29:30.869 --> 29:32.061
We paid.

29:33.558 --> 29:35.793
So why did he come after us?

29:38.270 --> 29:41.189
Okay, the corner of
Bleecker and Thompson--

29:41.190 --> 29:43.518
there are no security
cameras at the drop site,

29:43.519 --> 29:45.846
and so far, no witnesses.

29:45.902 --> 29:46.980
He covered his bases.

29:46.981 --> 29:49.028
I know. It's really
starting to piss me off.

29:49.029 --> 29:51.141
Yeah, and you get cute
when you get angry.

29:51.694 --> 29:53.718
But not when you
get angry with me.

29:53.719 --> 29:54.903
Yo.

29:54.930 --> 29:56.493
So I took a look Owen's family.

29:56.494 --> 29:58.061
I think I found
someone with motive.

29:58.062 --> 29:59.015
Turns out he has
an older brother,

29:59.112 --> 30:00.609
and apparently, they were close.

30:00.610 --> 30:02.036
Any connection to our victims?

30:02.037 --> 30:03.108
Oh, yeah

30:03.434 --> 30:04.695
see for yourself.

30:05.132 --> 30:08.198
Wait.
That's Leslie's husband, Darren.

30:08.199 --> 30:11.049
So Owen's brother is married
to our first victim's sister?

30:11.050 --> 30:12.349
What are the odds, right?

30:12.384 --> 30:14.834
Maybe Darren somehow found
out that his wife's sister

30:14.835 --> 30:16.633
was responsible for his
brother Owen's death.

30:16.634 --> 30:18.478
Well, maybe the families just
knew each other socially.

30:18.479 --> 30:19.810
It doesn't mean that
Darren's our killer.

30:19.811 --> 30:21.406
Oh, that doesn't,
but this might.

30:21.407 --> 30:23.660
CSU tracked down where
the photo was processed.

30:23.661 --> 30:24.602
It's from a roll of film,

30:24.603 --> 30:26.850
and the guy who dropped it
off had three copies made.

30:26.851 --> 30:29.022
And does the guy's
description match Darren's?

30:29.023 --> 30:31.589
Even better.
They had security cameras.

30:34.539 --> 30:35.779
It's him.

30:41.473 --> 30:44.752
I got here as fast as I could.
So is there any news?

30:44.753 --> 30:47.299
Did you find out who
did this to my sister?

30:48.787 --> 30:50.367
Uh, first let me ask,

30:50.781 --> 30:54.087
what was Amy's relationship
with your husband's brother--

30:54.088 --> 30:55.177
Owen?

30:55.272 --> 30:56.787
They were high school friends.

30:56.983 --> 30:58.201
We all were.

30:59.023 --> 31:00.603
What does this have
to do with Amy?

31:01.146 --> 31:02.634
Owen died years ago.

31:02.635 --> 31:04.364
You ever see this before?

31:07.039 --> 31:08.247
No.

31:11.613 --> 31:12.872
That's Amy,

31:12.990 --> 31:14.408
and that's Owen.

31:14.745 --> 31:16.212
These two I don't know.

31:17.035 --> 31:19.151
It's from the night
that he was killed.

31:19.786 --> 31:20.955
Okay.

31:21.104 --> 31:24.597
Your husband Darren had it
printed up two weeks ago.

31:24.598 --> 31:26.583
Do you have any
idea how he got it?

31:26.712 --> 31:28.114
Last month,

31:28.393 --> 31:30.227
we were cleaning
out my dad's attic

31:30.228 --> 31:33.666
and found a camera with
a roll of film inside.

31:35.817 --> 31:38.548
Darren thought it would be
fun to see what was on it.

31:40.178 --> 31:42.670
You--you don't think he had
anything to do with Amy...

31:45.711 --> 31:46.861
Do you?

31:46.883 --> 31:48.283
I don't know what you
guys are talking about.

31:48.284 --> 31:49.910
I didn't blackmail anybody.

31:49.911 --> 31:52.903
All right, so then you don't
recognize this photo?

31:54.684 --> 31:55.717
Absolutely not.

31:55.718 --> 31:57.050
And then...

31:57.051 --> 31:59.538
this isn't you, is it, Darren?

32:02.176 --> 32:04.307
I can only imagine how
you must have felt.

32:04.308 --> 32:07.188
After all these years, realizing
your own sister-in-law

32:07.189 --> 32:09.069
might be involved in
your brother's death.

32:09.070 --> 32:11.778
We found the cash in your
storage locker in Queens--

32:11.779 --> 32:15.336
$151,815.

32:15.337 --> 32:16.930
Which, by wild coincidence,

32:16.931 --> 32:21.587
is exactly $50,605 times 3.

32:24.996 --> 32:26.246
Owen was high.

32:26.982 --> 32:27.738
He was messed up.

32:27.739 --> 32:29.194
They knew that, and
what did they do?

32:29.195 --> 32:30.438
They left him there.

32:33.880 --> 32:35.284
You could've gone to the police.

32:35.285 --> 32:36.931
Because they did
such a bang-up job

32:36.932 --> 32:38.271
the first time around?

32:39.037 --> 32:40.118
I just wanted them to pay

32:40.119 --> 32:42.157
something for what they did.

32:42.958 --> 32:43.952
I was even gonna use the money

32:43.953 --> 32:46.022
to set up a scholarship
fund in Owen's name.

32:46.023 --> 32:48.647
Really, a scholarship fund?

32:48.648 --> 32:50.655
And what's your spin on murder?

32:50.656 --> 32:52.019
The money wasn't enough.

32:52.020 --> 32:53.580
You wanted revenge.

32:53.817 --> 32:56.295
You wanted them to die
like your brother,

32:56.296 --> 32:57.956
dressed in fairy-tale costumes,

32:57.957 --> 33:00.420
ODing on the same drugs he did.

33:00.593 --> 33:02.735
What? No.

33:03.823 --> 33:05.670
I don't know who killed
them, but it wasn't me.

33:05.671 --> 33:07.292
That's gonna be tough
to believe, Darren.

33:07.293 --> 33:10.069
You had motive, you blamed
them for Owen's death,

33:10.070 --> 33:12.609
and you just admitted
to blackmailing them.

33:16.348 --> 33:17.665
I want a lawyer.

33:21.461 --> 33:22.780
Of course you do.

33:24.693 --> 33:26.340
Darren doesn't need a lawyer.

33:26.341 --> 33:29.151
He needs a miracle.

33:29.597 --> 33:31.687
His wife told Ryan that

33:31.887 --> 33:34.807
he wasn't at the house when
the murders were committed.

33:34.808 --> 33:36.034
So that's it then.

33:36.844 --> 33:38.252
Yeah, for this case.

33:38.498 --> 33:41.888
We did everything but tie
a bow on it for the DA.

33:42.083 --> 33:43.726
Right this way, Ms. Morgan.

33:50.488 --> 33:52.023
Is it true, Darren?

33:52.087 --> 33:53.277
Is it true?

33:53.751 --> 33:55.853
Look me in the eyes and
tell me it's not true!

33:55.854 --> 33:56.690
No, babe. I didn't hurt anyone.

33:56.691 --> 33:58.561
You blackmailed my sister!

33:58.562 --> 34:00.496
- You lied to me. You-- 
- No, l-listen.

34:00.497 --> 34:02.811
I'm telling you the truth, okay?
I didn't kill anyone.

34:02.812 --> 34:03.804
I just wanted them to pay.

34:03.805 --> 34:05.855
Who would do it then?
You had the picture.

34:05.856 --> 34:07.458
- No, no! Babe, I swear--
- Oh, my God. It was you!

34:07.459 --> 34:08.792
- I swear. I swear. Babe--
- You know what?

34:08.793 --> 34:10.259
You need to get away
from me...

34:10.260 --> 34:10.967
- Babe-- 
- Right now!

34:10.967 --> 34:11.773
Listen!

34:12.438 --> 34:14.039
- Les-- 
- Stay away.

34:19.408 --> 34:21.768
Murder does more damage to
the living than to the dead.

34:21.770 --> 34:24.516
Yeah, all because of
a terrible secret.

34:24.516 --> 34:25.960
Well, secrets are
like time bombs.

34:25.962 --> 34:27.284
Yeah, eventually, they...

34:27.284 --> 34:28.531
explode.

34:31.293 --> 34:33.277
You know, Castle, I'm not saying
tt I condone what Darren did,

34:33.277 --> 34:35.117
but I do understand it.

34:35.277 --> 34:38.438
Yeah. No, I understand
wanting revenge.

34:38.643 --> 34:40.395
The way he went about it
doesn't add up, though.

34:40.396 --> 34:41.382
What do you mean?

34:41.507 --> 34:43.034
Well, blackmail

34:43.034 --> 34:45.143
is revenge from a distance.

34:45.143 --> 34:46.418
Murder is up close and personal.

34:46.418 --> 34:47.585
It doesn't make sense
he would do both.

34:47.585 --> 34:48.697
Don't underestimate him.

34:48.699 --> 34:51.601
I mean, the only reason
that he copped to blackmail

34:51.601 --> 34:53.664
was to avoid murder charges.

34:53.665 --> 34:54.956
And like any psychopath,

34:54.958 --> 34:55.924
he's a great actor.

34:55.925 --> 34:58.174
- Oh, speaking of...
- Psychopaths or actors?

34:58.175 --> 35:00.383
- I-I was thinking about your mom.
- Oh, so a little of both.

35:00.384 --> 35:02.071
I think we can make the play.

35:02.072 --> 35:03.204
Really?

35:03.252 --> 35:06.105
So you want to venture into
the dark, scary woods?

35:06.106 --> 35:07.930
Don't worry, Castle.
I got a gun.

35:07.931 --> 35:09.531
I'll protect you from
the big bad wolf.

35:09.532 --> 35:11.255
You'd use your gun on my mother?

35:12.968 --> 35:14.265
I'm touched.

35:14.461 --> 35:15.601
Thank you.

35:21.057 --> 35:22.206
Ah, thank you.

35:22.463 --> 35:24.439
Oh, wow, Castle.
This is quite the soiree.

35:24.440 --> 35:26.060
Yeah, it's a family trait.

35:26.061 --> 35:27.800
We tend to go big. Cheers.

35:27.801 --> 35:28.888
Cheers.

35:32.440 --> 35:34.803
- Would you excuse me a moment?
- Yeah.

35:36.133 --> 35:37.299
Hey.

35:38.218 --> 35:39.316
Hey. You came.

35:39.317 --> 35:41.635
Oh, it means so much
to me, darling.

35:41.636 --> 35:42.782
She was worried you
wouldn't make it.

35:42.783 --> 35:43.837
Break a leg, mother.

35:43.838 --> 35:46.345
We have a schedule to keep.
Curtain in two minutes.

35:46.346 --> 35:48.304
I can't get this bow straight.

35:48.305 --> 35:50.000
Allow me. Allow me.

35:51.523 --> 35:53.343
Oh, maybe I should
have Alexis do it.

35:53.344 --> 35:55.309
I mean, how many bows have
you tied in your lifetime?

35:55.310 --> 35:57.129
Well, I tie my shoes every day.

35:57.130 --> 35:58.188
If you remember, you taught me.

35:58.189 --> 36:00.170
Yeah, yeah, true.

36:01.378 --> 36:02.574
The bow.

36:03.502 --> 36:04.632
The bow was tied incorrectly.

36:04.633 --> 36:06.977
Well, I told you, we
should've had Alexis do it.

36:06.978 --> 36:10.112
Not your bow. The other bow.
The one on her costume.

36:10.113 --> 36:11.804
We arrested the wrong man.

36:17.950 --> 36:19.968
What? I-I don't understand.

36:19.981 --> 36:21.888
So you're saying
Darren didn't do it?

36:21.889 --> 36:23.142
Well, he's guilty of blackmail,

36:23.143 --> 36:24.471
but that's as far as it goes.

36:24.472 --> 36:25.657
So what if the killer's
still out there?

36:25.658 --> 36:26.839
What if he comes after me?

36:26.840 --> 36:27.938
He won't.

36:28.452 --> 36:31.012
We have officers outside 24/7.

36:31.574 --> 36:32.422
We'll find him, Charlotte.

36:32.423 --> 36:33.716
We just, um,

36:33.773 --> 36:35.146
we need a bit of your help.

36:35.147 --> 36:37.381
Of course. Whatever I can do.

36:37.864 --> 36:39.310
Well, we think that the key

36:39.311 --> 36:42.262
to finding the real killer

36:42.263 --> 36:44.823
is through understanding
exactly what happened

36:44.824 --> 36:46.041
the night of Owen's death.

36:46.042 --> 36:48.204
Can you answer a few questions?

36:48.874 --> 36:49.748
Y-yeah. I mean, I guess so,

36:49.749 --> 36:52.113
though I'm pretty sure I
told you everything I know.

36:52.114 --> 36:53.851
Well, last time we spoke,
you said that everyone

36:53.852 --> 36:55.049
was in Amy's car?

36:55.050 --> 36:56.037
Right.

36:56.038 --> 36:57.461
And who was driving?

36:57.505 --> 36:59.710
She was. Why?

36:59.834 --> 37:01.551
Well, we did a little checking.

37:01.552 --> 37:02.467
The day after Owen died,

37:02.468 --> 37:04.014
Amy brought her car
to a body shop.

37:04.015 --> 37:06.022
She had a broken grille
and a dented bumper.

37:06.023 --> 37:08.094
Any idea how she
got those dents?

37:09.877 --> 37:11.810
Charlotte, what really
happened that night?

37:12.032 --> 37:14.723
Did Owen try to get
back into the car?

37:14.724 --> 37:16.142
Maybe Amy panicked,

37:16.599 --> 37:19.764
accidentally hitting
him as she drove away?

37:23.463 --> 37:24.633
Charlotte?

37:25.960 --> 37:28.087
I begged Amy to go back.

37:28.461 --> 37:29.427
Kristina and I both did.

37:29.428 --> 37:31.766
We begged her, but she
just kept driving.

37:31.858 --> 37:32.978
She didn't mean to hurt him.

37:32.979 --> 37:35.061
It was just an accident.

37:36.693 --> 37:39.511
That's the truth.
That's what really happened.

37:39.730 --> 37:40.862
Is it?

37:42.997 --> 37:44.351
Take a look

37:45.163 --> 37:46.227
at how the bows

37:46.228 --> 37:49.472
are tied on the victims' stumes.

37:51.672 --> 37:52.977
What about them?

37:53.316 --> 37:54.884
Well, the killer tied these bows

37:54.885 --> 37:56.754
after the victims were drugged.

37:57.437 --> 37:58.610
See how they look,

37:58.611 --> 38:02.628
how the loops are
pleasingly horizontal?

38:03.013 --> 38:06.766
Now... look at the bow on
your Sleeping Beauty outfit.

38:08.579 --> 38:10.221
See how the loops are vertical?

38:11.075 --> 38:12.321
It's a little weird.

38:12.422 --> 38:14.546
I mean, if the killer
tied all three bows,

38:14.547 --> 38:16.388
why would yours be different?

38:16.662 --> 38:18.743
It's because you tied

38:18.744 --> 38:20.623
all three bows.

38:20.624 --> 38:23.897
This one is different because
you tied it on yourself

38:23.898 --> 38:25.104
behind your back.

38:25.105 --> 38:27.307
No. I was attacked.

38:27.308 --> 38:28.781
I am a victim.

38:28.870 --> 38:30.670
Yet, your doctor
said you received

38:30.671 --> 38:33.112
half the dose of oxy that
the other girls got,

38:33.113 --> 38:34.335
a nonlethal dose.

38:34.336 --> 38:35.639
How soon after we pulled up

38:35.640 --> 38:38.075
outside of your building did
you give yourself that shot?

38:38.076 --> 38:39.320
This is crazy.

38:39.321 --> 38:41.380
Why would I fake an
attack on myself?

38:41.381 --> 38:42.434
So no one would suspect you

38:42.435 --> 38:44.402
of silencing the only two
witnesses to your crime.

38:44.403 --> 38:46.275
What are you talking about?

38:46.295 --> 38:48.713
At the time, Kristina and Amy

38:48.714 --> 38:50.768
were willing to
bury your secret,

38:50.769 --> 38:52.027
but then...

38:52.417 --> 38:54.321
this photo showed up.

38:54.762 --> 38:56.066
I mean, how long could
you expect them

38:56.067 --> 38:56.873
to keep the secret,

38:56.874 --> 38:58.924
especially since
you were at fault?

38:58.925 --> 39:01.166
All you could think
about was the scandal--

39:01.167 --> 39:04.865
jail, how it would
ruin your life--

39:05.126 --> 39:07.407
all because Kristina and
Amy knew the truth.

39:07.408 --> 39:08.723
Charlotte,

39:08.967 --> 39:12.474
you were behind the
wheel in Amy's car.

39:12.475 --> 39:13.908
It was you

39:13.909 --> 39:16.881
that hit and killed Owen.

39:16.882 --> 39:19.315
No, Amy was driving. I told you.

39:19.316 --> 39:22.227
Then why did you pay
for the car repairs?

39:23.504 --> 39:25.372
We have the receipt.

39:37.116 --> 39:40.046
You don't know what
happened that night.

39:40.047 --> 39:41.941
You can't prove that I hit Owen,

39:41.942 --> 39:46.089
and you can't prove that I
killed Amy or Kristina.

39:48.276 --> 39:49.616
Yes, I can.

39:49.972 --> 39:51.472
Your firm handled the
reverse mortgage

39:51.473 --> 39:54.278
of an old woman named
Jamie Isaacson.

39:54.829 --> 39:57.533
She paid closing costs
with her credit card.

39:57.534 --> 39:59.387
That's the same credit card

39:59.388 --> 40:03.425
that you used to pay for
all three costumes.

40:05.385 --> 40:06.988
Charlotte Boyd, you
are under arrest

40:06.989 --> 40:09.121
for the murders of Amy Morgan...

40:09.122 --> 40:10.257
Kristina Curtis,

40:10.258 --> 40:13.468
and the wrongful death
of Owen Thomas.

40:17.545 --> 40:18.869
The bows?

40:19.568 --> 40:20.892
Seriously?

40:25.319 --> 40:27.478
She's actually the perfect
fairy-tale villain.

40:27.479 --> 40:28.410
Like the big bad wolf,

40:28.411 --> 40:29.801
she disguised herself
as an innocent,

40:29.802 --> 40:32.212
but like Snow White's
evil stepmother,

40:32.213 --> 40:33.962
she was willing to do
anything, even kill,

40:33.963 --> 40:35.222
to protect her image.

40:35.223 --> 40:36.379
After all these years,

40:36.380 --> 40:38.624
maybe Owen's family can have
some closure about his death.

40:38.625 --> 40:39.678
Yeah, but at what cost?

40:39.679 --> 40:40.744
Two women are dead,

40:40.745 --> 40:42.473
Darren's still being
charged with blackmail,

40:42.474 --> 40:43.693
and I'm sure his
marriage is over.

40:43.694 --> 40:45.721
Well, and that's why
we need fairy tales

40:45.722 --> 40:47.387
in the face of too much reality,

40:47.388 --> 40:50.580
to remind us that happy
endings are still possible.

40:50.581 --> 40:51.902
All right.
See you in the morning.

40:51.903 --> 40:53.493
- Later.
- Vale.

40:53.548 --> 40:54.845
Speaking of fairy tales,

40:54.846 --> 40:57.691
my mother is ready to give
her encore performance.

40:57.782 --> 40:59.066
Time to go back into the woods?

40:59.067 --> 41:00.545
Still got your gun?

41:01.148 --> 41:03.807
It was the opportunity

41:04.254 --> 41:05.322
of a lifetime--

41:05.323 --> 41:06.800
the chance to originate the role

41:06.801 --> 41:09.103
of the Wicked Witch on Broadway.

41:09.104 --> 41:11.511
But it would mean
being away from home

41:11.512 --> 41:13.448
six nights a week, two matinees.

41:13.449 --> 41:15.818
Huh. What was I to do?

41:15.819 --> 41:17.735
Realize that none of
it ever happened?

41:17.736 --> 41:20.697
Francis Bacon once wrote,

41:20.698 --> 41:23.024
"He that hath children

41:23.025 --> 41:26.421
hath given hostages to fortune."

41:26.422 --> 41:29.756
Well, if I was a hostage,
then my son Richard

41:29.757 --> 41:31.478
was my captor,

41:31.479 --> 41:33.406
my enslaver.

41:33.407 --> 41:34.732
Hey, I'm right here.

41:34.733 --> 41:39.427
I turned down the role,
turned my back on fortune.

41:39.428 --> 41:40.500
And...

41:40.501 --> 41:42.787
it was the best career
move I ever made,

41:42.788 --> 41:46.170
for an even greater
role came my way.

41:46.171 --> 41:47.667
A part--

41:47.668 --> 41:51.982
perhaps the greatest role
that I have ever played--

41:52.077 --> 41:53.268
that...

41:53.661 --> 41:54.960
of mother.

41:57.112 --> 41:58.246
That's sweet.

41:58.247 --> 41:59.818
You're right. That is sweet.

41:59.819 --> 42:00.968
Shh.

42:01.508 --> 42:02.252
Sorry.

42:02.253 --> 42:04.247
Now if Richard

42:04.248 --> 42:08.234
had only been able to
embrace the role of son

42:08.235 --> 42:11.012
with the same level
of commitment.

42:11.013 --> 42:13.516
And into the woods we go.
