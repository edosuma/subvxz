08:56.278 --> 08:57.536

08:57.612 --> 08:59.696

08:59.706 --> 09:03.157
Well, this--
this is humiliating.

09:03.234 --> 09:05.001
I...

09:06.404 --> 09:08.630
Well, the truth is, I--

09:10.241 --> 09:13.885
I stayed too long
on the treadmill at the gym.

09:13.962 --> 09:16.129
Yeah, they had ESPN on,

09:16.205 --> 09:18.631
and I--I guess I got
carried away watching the game.

09:18.708 --> 09:20.633
Daddy, I promise you,
you could see a football

09:20.710 --> 09:22.060
sitting on the side
of the road,

09:22.137 --> 09:23.636

and stare at it.

09:25.381 --> 09:26.456

on the drive home,

09:28.143 --> 09:30.560

and got a milkshake

09:30.571 --> 09:32.404

I just passed out in the lobby.

You didn't tell me that.
