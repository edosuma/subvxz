00:04.505 --> 00:07.633
I think we all feel an empty place.

00:09.259 --> 00:11.970
Everybody loved Jennifer.

00:13.013 --> 00:16.808
Not just because
she was a special person...

00:18.060 --> 00:23.524
...but because she was the kind of friend
who was always there for you.

00:25.400 --> 00:28.654
We'll miss you, Jen.

00:28.737 --> 00:31.865
We'll miss your smile.

00:34.326 --> 00:38.497
We'll miss the times
we would have spent together.

00:39.915 --> 00:44.086
We'll keep these memories
close to our hearts...

00:45.420 --> 00:48.173
...until we meet again in God's kingdom.

01:27.880 --> 01:30.632
The family has requested a graveside service.

01:30.716 --> 01:33.635
I've rescheduled the burial
to tomorrow afternoon.

01:33.719 --> 01:36.430
We'll keep the body overnight.

02:08.127 --> 02:10.631
Such a beautiful girl.

02:52.381 --> 02:54.466
Hello?

02:59.680 --> 03:01.765
Who's there?

03:10.399 --> 03:12.818
I said "Who's there?"

03:21.368 --> 03:23.453
Donnie...

03:27.249 --> 03:30.377
What the hell are you
doing here this late?

03:31.753 --> 03:34.965
- Working.
- Working... at this hour?

03:44.933 --> 03:47.519
What is this?

03:48.770 --> 03:51.315
What the hell were you doing?

04:04.578 --> 04:07.164
Get out of here.

04:09.124 --> 04:11.210
You freak!

04:12.461 --> 04:15.464
Get out of here! And don't come back.

04:24.097 --> 04:28.644
I should report you!
Just go on. Get out of here!

05:15.107 --> 05:17.609
I got the call from Minneapolis PD...

05:17.693 --> 05:20.737
...saying they wanted the FBI
to come out and take a look.

05:20.821 --> 05:25.534
Anything slightly freakazoid,
that's the drill. Call Moe Bocks.

05:25.617 --> 05:28.787
As if I'm tight
with all the nutcases in town!

05:28.871 --> 05:32.291
So I shoot on down here
to see what's the what.

05:32.374 --> 05:36.211
And I'll be damned if I'm not knocked
on my butt by what they show me.

05:36.295 --> 05:39.339
22 years I've never seen anything like it!

05:39.423 --> 05:43.302
I get one look at the corpse and I'm
on the phone to my pal Andy Schneider...

05:43.385 --> 05:47.014
...down at the Mutual UFO Network.
You know Andy?

05:47.097 --> 05:49.725
- No, I don't.
- Well, he knows you.

05:49.808 --> 05:55.314
- Why'd you call MUFON?
- To see if there was UFO activity in the area.

05:55.397 --> 05:58.275
You think this grave
was unearthed by aliens?

05:58.358 --> 06:01.361
Well, it has all the telltale signs,
don't you think?

06:01.445 --> 06:04.698
- I mean, according to the literature.
- Literature?

06:04.781 --> 06:07.326
You know the way
the hair and nails are cut away?

06:07.409 --> 06:10.996
Sorta like they do in cattle mutilations.

06:14.082 --> 06:16.668
I hate to disappoint you, Agent Bocks...

06:16.752 --> 06:20.797
...but it doesn't look like the work of aliens.
- No? How can you be sure?

06:20.881 --> 06:23.800
I've seen this kind of thing
before at Violent Crimes.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.762
Whoever dug this up
probably used a backhoe.

06:26.845 --> 06:32.267
If you check the ground, you'll probably
find new tracks leading to a garage nearby.

06:32.351 --> 06:34.978
- You think?
- He may work here, but it's unlikely.

06:35.062 --> 06:38.273
He's probably worked at a mortuary
or cemetery at some time.

06:38.357 --> 06:41.360
Probably been busted,
but you won't find any record.

06:41.443 --> 06:44.988
It has to be bad for business
when those kind of stories get around.

06:45.072 --> 06:48.116
You're saying
some human's been doing this?

06:48.200 --> 06:50.744
Yeah, if you wanna call him that.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.996
- You OK, Scully?
- Yeah.

06:53.080 --> 06:57.042
I've read about cases of desecrating
the dead, but never seen it.

06:57.125 --> 07:00.379
Nothing can prepare you for it.
It's almost unimaginable.

07:00.462 --> 07:05.217
- Why do they do it?
- Well, people collect salt and pepper shakers.

07:05.300 --> 07:09.847
Fetishists collect dead things-fingernails
and hair. No one quite knows why.

07:09.930 --> 07:15.310
Though I've never really understood
salt and pepper shakers myself.

07:18.689 --> 07:21.275
- Sometimes you surprise me, Mulder.
- Why's that?

07:21.358 --> 07:23.694
How that didn't shock you back there.

07:23.777 --> 07:27.781
I'd prepared myself for it
before we left Washington.

07:32.369 --> 07:35.205
You knew this wasn't UFO related
from the start?

07:35.289 --> 07:37.749
I'd suspected as much, yeah.

07:37.833 --> 07:41.795
It took us three hours to get here.
Our plane doesn't leave until tomorrow.

07:41.879 --> 07:45.007
- If you suspected...
- Vikings versus Redskins, Scully.

07:45.090 --> 07:48.343
40-yard line
in the Hubert H Humphrey Metrodome.

07:48.427 --> 07:50.721
You and me.

07:54.141 --> 07:57.394
Have you lived in
the Twin Cities area long, Mr Pfaster?

07:57.477 --> 08:01.148
I grew up here. I was away for a few years.

08:01.523 --> 08:04.776
Oh... What kind of work
were you in before?

08:04.860 --> 08:07.738
Cosmetology. Hair and make-up.

08:08.780 --> 08:11.325
Oh... It's interesting.

08:11.783 --> 08:16.914
If you don't mind my saying,
that's a lovely colour lipstick you're wearing.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.082
Is that Indian Summer?

08:20.000 --> 08:23.420
Yes... Yes, it is.

08:26.757 --> 08:29.343
You're applying for the job
as the delivery man?

08:29.426 --> 08:33.096
To put myself through school.
I've gone back to school.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.265
Oh. And what are you studying?

08:35.349 --> 08:37.976
- Comparative religions.
- Oh.

08:38.434 --> 08:43.148
- Are you a religious person yourself?
- Yes. Very.

08:45.651 --> 08:51.406
I shouldn't say this, but Mr Ficicello feels
very strongly about religious backgrounds.

08:51.490 --> 08:55.536
He prides himself
on the honesty of his employees.

08:55.619 --> 08:58.288
Can you put that on the application?

08:58.372 --> 09:01.750
- I'll attach a little note.
- Thank you.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.419
Long, long pass.
Here's Garner with the catch.

09:04.503 --> 09:10.050
And Garner brought down at the Washington
five-yard line for a Viking first down.

09:11.093 --> 09:15.681
Sorry you had to miss your game,
but we've found more bodies dug up.

09:16.181 --> 09:19.184
Did you get your Forensics report
on the first one yet?

09:19.268 --> 09:21.520
There was somebody down in the grave.

09:21.603 --> 09:26.108
Cut the hair with a pair of pinking shears.
Gotta wonder about this guy!

09:26.191 --> 09:29.319
Well, at least he wasn't down there
with his blow-dryer.

09:29.403 --> 09:32.614
- How many bodies does that make?
- Three in the last two days.

09:32.698 --> 09:35.492
What else can you tell me about the corpses?

09:35.576 --> 09:38.787
The hair was cut from the heads
of two of the bodies.

09:38.871 --> 09:41.623
From the third,
the fingernails were pulled out...

09:41.707 --> 09:45.669
...with what looks like
a pair of needle-nosed pliers.

09:50.716 --> 09:53.719
I want you to draft
an eyes-only memo to everyone here...

09:53.802 --> 09:56.972
...and to all law enforcement
agencies in the area.

09:57.055 --> 09:58.307
Saying what?

09:58.390 --> 10:02.644
That the Twin Cities may have a...
escalating fetishist on their hands.

10:02.728 --> 10:05.856
- A what?
- An escalating fetishist.

10:05.939 --> 10:09.526
Security should be tightened
around cemeteries and funeral homes.

10:09.610 --> 10:11.737
Hospitals should be notified.

10:11.820 --> 10:16.283
A story should be issued to the press
warning of a possible stalker in the area.

10:16.366 --> 10:19.077
This isn't New York, Agent Mulder.

10:19.161 --> 10:22.581
People keep their doors unlocked here.
This is gonna scare 'em.

10:22.664 --> 10:26.210
Well, leave out the more gruesome aspects
in your press release.

10:26.293 --> 10:29.880
Why do you want to alarm folks
if this guy only preys on dead people?

10:29.963 --> 10:34.468
Because his compulsion is growing. He may
resort to homicide to procure his corpses.

10:34.551 --> 10:39.556
Once he gets the taste of a warm body,
he's probably gonna want more.

10:40.349 --> 10:44.603
Maybe I've been isolated up here
in the great white North too long.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.939
What do you mean?

10:47.022 --> 10:51.485
People wondered why it took them so long
to catch this kid in Milwaukee.

10:51.568 --> 10:56.657
Thought someone should've noticed
he was killing all those young boys.

10:56.740 --> 11:00.410
Truth is... no one ever believed
it could happen.

11:03.872 --> 11:07.417
If you catch this guy first,
maybe they can go on believing that.

11:07.501 --> 11:12.256
We don't have the manpower or expertise
to move on this with any speed.

11:12.339 --> 11:15.175
It's gonna be hard to round up anybody
on a Saturday.

11:15.259 --> 11:20.055
It could be Monday or Tuesday
before we get our ducks in a row.

11:27.187 --> 11:31.859
We have some work to do here.
I'm gonna cancel our flight out.

11:32.568 --> 11:35.153
- Scully?
- I'll be right there.

11:43.996 --> 11:49.543
A complete model or psychological
profile of the death fetishist does not exist.

11:49.626 --> 11:53.755
The compulsion is a result
of a complex misplacement of values...

11:53.839 --> 11:58.093
...and a deviation from
cultural norms and social mores.

11:58.177 --> 12:03.432
He is more likely to be white, male, and
of average to above-average intelligence.

12:03.515 --> 12:07.978
Cases of fetishists with IQs over 150
have been documented.

12:08.854 --> 12:12.399
The progression of the pathology
moves from the fantasy stage...

12:12.482 --> 12:18.655
...to the eventual acting out of fetishistic
impulses, including opportunistic homicide.

12:18.739 --> 12:24.536
Agent Mulder believes that the suspect
in this case is escalating towards this action.

12:24.620 --> 12:29.708
Once he begins to murder, the killing
draws attention away from a deeper motive.

12:29.791 --> 12:35.172
A motive which most people, including law
enforcement professionals, dare not imagine.

12:35.255 --> 12:41.094
It is somehow easier to believe,
as Agent Bocks does, in aliens and UFOs...

12:41.178 --> 12:45.182
...than in the kind of inhuman monster
who could prey on the living...

12:45.265 --> 12:47.184
...to scavenge from the dead.

13:01.907 --> 13:03.992
Hi.

13:04.076 --> 13:06.119
Hello there!

13:20.008 --> 13:22.511
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:23.345 --> 13:25.639
Are you looking for a date?

13:27.057 --> 13:28.684
Yes.

13:28.767 --> 13:31.728
Why don't you pull up
around the corner over there?

13:31.812 --> 13:35.649
Well, actually, I was thinking
of a couple of hours.

13:38.986 --> 13:41.488
Where do you have in mind?

13:59.423 --> 14:03.093
Don't you have any heat in here?
It's freezing.

14:04.970 --> 14:08.015
The forced-air unit is broken.

14:08.098 --> 14:10.601
I'd like to run you a bath.

14:39.838 --> 14:42.132
Is your hair treated?

14:43.300 --> 14:45.385
What?

14:46.762 --> 14:50.974
Do you need a shampoo
for chemically treated hair?

14:51.058 --> 14:53.519
You want me to shampoo my hair?

14:53.602 --> 14:57.898
I'll pay extra if that's
something out of the ordinary.

15:00.567 --> 15:03.195
Well, nobody's ever asked me.

15:22.214 --> 15:24.299
Excuse me.

15:35.978 --> 15:36.812
Hello?

15:36.895 --> 15:39.857
- Is this Mr Pfaster?
- Yes.

15:39.940 --> 15:45.279
Hi, this is Marilyn at Ficicello Frozen Foods.
Sorry to bother you so late...

15:45.362 --> 15:49.533
...but I'm calling to say you've been hired.
We'd like you to start right away.

15:49.616 --> 15:53.662
Hey, what's going on here?
The water is ice-cold.

15:59.960 --> 16:02.254
What kind of sick freak are you?

16:05.424 --> 16:06.675
Oh, my God!

16:06.758 --> 16:11.221
- Mr Pfaster?
- Yes. That's wonderful news.

16:11.722 --> 16:13.557
Thank you so much.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.059
Don't you come near me.

16:16.143 --> 16:18.228
I mean it.

16:19.146 --> 16:21.398
Don't you touch me!

16:21.481 --> 16:23.901
Stay away from me!

16:23.984 --> 16:26.987
Keep away from me!
Don't you come near me.

16:36.455 --> 16:41.084
We're still waiting
for someone to ID the body.

16:41.168 --> 16:45.714
Judging from the area,
I'd say she's probably a working girl.

16:51.762 --> 16:53.847
Watch your step.

16:53.931 --> 16:55.933
No...

16:56.016 --> 16:58.101
Oh, my God!

16:58.810 --> 17:00.896
Oh, my God!

17:01.522 --> 17:03.607
Who did this to her?

17:04.983 --> 17:07.944
- Was it him?
- Looks like it.

17:08.028 --> 17:13.200
Knife wound the length of the torso.
Cut all her hair off. Took her fingernails.

17:13.282 --> 17:16.078
This time he took some fingers, too.

17:16.161 --> 17:18.454
- Wanna see the body?
- Yeah.

17:26.588 --> 17:28.882
I need a minute.

17:30.425 --> 17:32.719
Hey! Let him take a look.

18:11.008 --> 18:13.510
Hi. I'm your new delivery man.

18:14.052 --> 18:16.597
Oh, hi. Come in.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.936
Did they give you Skip's old route?

18:23.020 --> 18:28.066
Yes, I think so.
I've just started with the company.

18:28.150 --> 18:32.613
Skip's been delivering to us so long,
we took it for granted he'd always be around.

18:32.696 --> 18:35.073
Since before the kids were born.

18:36.491 --> 18:38.994
Lisa, this is, uh...

18:39.745 --> 18:42.164
Donnie. Donnie Pfaster.

18:42.539 --> 18:45.584
- He's taking over for Skip.
- Oh, hi.

18:45.667 --> 18:49.338
- I'm gonna go over to Steve's now, OK?
- OK. You have a good time.

18:49.421 --> 18:51.507
- Bye.
- Bye.

18:53.425 --> 18:55.928
We have three daughters.

18:56.428 --> 18:58.514
Oh.

19:00.724 --> 19:05.479
Pardon me. May I use your washroom
to wash up my hands?

19:05.562 --> 19:07.898
Sure. There's a washroom just off the porch.

20:02.411 --> 20:06.999
I just wanted to tell you, if we're ever not
home, we always leave the back door open.

20:07.082 --> 20:11.128
Oh. Thank you. I'll remember that.

20:22.806 --> 20:25.475
Death is a recorded event...

20:25.559 --> 20:28.270
...for reasons natural or unnatural.

20:28.353 --> 20:33.442
When a body ceases to function, the cause
of the effect can be clearly reconstructed.

20:33.525 --> 20:36.028
A body has a story to tell.

20:42.492 --> 20:46.455
The time is 11.14am, Monday November 14th.

20:47.456 --> 20:50.792
The deceased is a female in her twenties.

20:51.376 --> 20:56.256
If the victim was strangled, an examination
of the veins in the eyes will reveal this.

20:56.340 --> 20:59.718
If shot, entry wounds
and gunpowder residue can be used...

20:59.801 --> 21:04.890
...to reconstruct the events leading to death
and help to establish a possible motive.

21:04.973 --> 21:09.853
Hair and fibres, slivers of glass,
plastic, even insect casings...

21:09.937 --> 21:14.525
...can serve to recreate the circumstances
under which death occurred.

21:14.608 --> 21:20.113
It may be an irony only understood by those
of us who conduct these examinations...

21:20.197 --> 21:25.369
...that death, like life itself, is a drama
with a beginning, middle and end.

21:25.452 --> 21:28.664
It is my opinion,
having conducted this examination...

21:28.747 --> 21:35.170
...that the victim died a wrongful death for the
purpose of extracting her hair and fingernails.

21:35.254 --> 21:37.881
The time of death
cannot be accurately judged...

21:37.965 --> 21:43.428
...due, I believe, to immersion in
a cold environment, most likely water.

21:43.512 --> 21:45.973
For the record, it is my opinion that...

21:46.056 --> 21:50.310
...outside of child homicide,
which may be more tragic...

21:50.394 --> 21:54.398
...this is one of the most angry
and dehumanising murders imaginable.

21:54.481 --> 21:56.358
Mm-mm, I just don't know.

21:56.441 --> 21:58.944
Look at each man carefully.

22:00.654 --> 22:05.909
He's none of those guys. He was ordinary.
He didn't look like no freak.

22:05.993 --> 22:10.622
Do you remember what kind of car
he was driving, what colour it was?

22:10.706 --> 22:13.041
I think it was white.

22:13.125 --> 22:18.755
OK, you can go. Just leave a number
and address where you can be reached.

22:18.839 --> 22:21.049
- You gonna catch this guy?
- We'll catch him.

22:21.133 --> 22:25.345
Might be a good week to take
that paid vacation the boss owes you.

22:25.429 --> 22:27.723
Yeah. Right!

22:30.559 --> 22:35.772
If this guy looks regular and doesn't have a
record, he's gonna be near impossible to find.

22:35.856 --> 22:39.276
Until he kills again, or until
we can determine what drives him.

22:39.359 --> 22:44.781
I read your profile. Sounds like he can't make
it with women. It would explain the hooker.

22:44.865 --> 22:48.368
The hooker was just convenient.
He's after trophies.

22:48.452 --> 22:52.789
His victim was a young, attractive woman.
The corpses he dug up were young women.

22:52.873 --> 22:57.920
What's fuelling his need? What's important
about the hair and fingernails to him?

22:58.003 --> 23:01.924
It's as if it's not enough that they're dead,
he's also gotta defile them.

23:02.007 --> 23:04.092
There's a deeper psychosis here.

23:04.176 --> 23:08.972
It's an unfathomable hatred of women,
probably going back to his mother.

23:09.056 --> 23:12.100
I'd say she's pretty fried at him, too.

23:12.184 --> 23:15.687
I think we should call
all the psychiatric facilities in the area...

23:15.771 --> 23:19.149
...and ask if they have any patients
with similar pathologies.

23:19.233 --> 23:24.279
This kind of a monster isn't made overnight.
He's been developing this fetish for years.

23:24.446 --> 23:30.494
The necessity of the story-myth -
in a culture is almost universal.

23:30.577 --> 23:35.457
We think of myths as things
that entertain or instruct.

23:36.416 --> 23:41.213
But their deeper purpose
is often to explain, or make fanciful...

23:41.922 --> 23:48.220
...desires, wishes or behaviour that society
would otherwise deem unacceptable.

23:48.303 --> 23:52.307
Because they are conveyed
in a wrapping of untruth-the story -

23:52.391 --> 23:54.518
these thoughts become harmless.

23:54.601 --> 23:58.105
Take, for example, the stories
we recite to our children.

23:58.188 --> 24:00.274
Snow White, Alice in Wonderland...

24:00.357 --> 24:04.486
The subtextual themes,
when the Queen orders "Off with her head!"...

24:04.570 --> 24:07.823
...or the Prince awakens
Sleeping Beauty with a kiss...

24:07.906 --> 24:11.743
...are what Freud would describe
as death-wish imaginings.

24:26.967 --> 24:30.387
Excuse me. I'm in your mythology class.

24:31.513 --> 24:33.974
- Uh-huh?
- My name's Donnie.

24:34.057 --> 24:38.395
I sit a couple of rows over.
Maybe you've seen me.

24:39.313 --> 24:43.275
- Uh, I don't know. I...
- I know. You sit up front.

24:44.610 --> 24:46.695
I just...

24:47.196 --> 24:52.409
See, I... I was going to my car
and I saw you... and...

24:53.660 --> 24:58.207
Did he ask us to read
chapters 10 and 11, or 11 and 12?

24:59.374 --> 25:03.378
Oh... I... uh, I think it was, uh...

25:09.968 --> 25:13.555
- It was chapters 10 and 11.
- Oh, thanks.

25:23.607 --> 25:25.817
I have to go now.

25:25.901 --> 25:28.654
- Don't go.
- Let go of the door.

25:33.033 --> 25:36.954
Help! Someone! Help!

25:56.390 --> 25:58.225
- Hello?
- It's me.

25:58.308 --> 26:02.229
They've arrested somebody
they think may be our guy.

26:03.605 --> 26:05.899
I'll get dressed.

26:09.736 --> 26:11.864
He's got a history of assault.

26:11.947 --> 26:15.409
911 call came in from a security officer
who saw it happen.

26:15.492 --> 26:17.995
She hurt him pretty bad.

26:19.830 --> 26:22.332
Yeah, he's definitely our guy.

26:23.917 --> 26:26.628
- Who cut him?
- A working girl.

26:26.712 --> 26:30.674
They're all carrying knives
since what happened.

26:31.466 --> 26:35.095
I'm Agent Mulder.
Have you been read your rights?

26:49.860 --> 26:52.654
I paid her the money,
then she hauls out this knife.

26:52.738 --> 26:56.575
What am I supposed to do?
I smacked her a couple of times.

26:56.658 --> 26:59.411
Self-defence. Self-defence...

27:08.003 --> 27:10.380
- He's not our guy.
- I thought we had him.

27:10.464 --> 27:12.758
We're back to square one.

27:23.769 --> 27:26.647
Mulder, can I have a minute with you?

27:29.358 --> 27:31.652
I'll wait out front.

27:34.863 --> 27:39.117
I might better drive this investigation
if I could focus on the evidence.

27:39.201 --> 27:42.621
- What do you suggest?
- That I take the body back to Washington.

27:42.704 --> 27:45.832
I could run it through
the fingerprint lab. Those guys...

27:45.916 --> 27:50.379
Scully, if you're having trouble
with this case, I want you to tell me.

27:50.462 --> 27:52.798
- I'm not, Mulder.
- I'd understand.

27:52.881 --> 27:56.844
- I mean, it's not exactly easy to stomach.
- I'm fine.

27:56.927 --> 28:00.597
Really... I just think we're a long way
from catching this guy.

28:00.681 --> 28:06.311
If we could get a print, we'd have something
to focus on. Right now we're at a standstill.

28:06.395 --> 28:09.523
I think it's a good idea.

28:09.606 --> 28:13.777
I just don't want you to think
you have to hide anything from me.

28:13.861 --> 28:19.658
I've seen agents with 20 years' field
experience fall apart on cases like this.

28:19.741 --> 28:22.411
I'm fine. I can handle it.

28:38.177 --> 28:40.262
Hey...

28:40.971 --> 28:43.640
What's your name?

28:43.724 --> 28:46.226
- You talking to me?
- Yeah.

28:48.353 --> 28:50.856
Were those FBI agents?

28:53.192 --> 28:55.277
Yeah.

28:55.861 --> 28:58.572
What were they asking you?

29:00.199 --> 29:05.370
They thought I was some freak
who's been diggin' up corpses!

29:05.454 --> 29:08.123
Man, I'm in enough trouble already.

29:09.124 --> 29:11.627
What were their names?

29:12.211 --> 29:15.088
- Who?
- The younger agents.

29:16.173 --> 29:18.258
Oh...

29:18.842 --> 29:21.303
Uh, I don't remember his name.

29:21.386 --> 29:26.016
She was Scully.
Like that baseball announcer.

29:29.937 --> 29:32.689
Let's go, Mr Pfaster.

29:32.773 --> 29:36.235
- Go where?
- Lady's dropped the charges against you.

29:36.318 --> 29:41.406
They're letting you out as soon as
you talk to a psychiatric social worker.

29:56.797 --> 30:01.718
At first glance, there's not much to work with.
Satin doesn't hold a print real well.

30:01.802 --> 30:04.221
There may be a latent in these blood stains.

30:04.304 --> 30:07.015
I suspect the killer wore gloves.

30:07.599 --> 30:10.561
Well, the body was on my flight,
so it should be here soon.

30:10.644 --> 30:13.856
We'll take a look. How long
are you in town, Agent Scully?

30:13.939 --> 30:18.485
I have a flight back to Minneapolis
booked for tonight, but, um... I might cancel.

30:18.569 --> 30:20.988
I've put all other work aside.

30:21.071 --> 30:22.739
Thanks.

30:42.176 --> 30:46.180
You think that you find a way
to deal with these things.

30:47.181 --> 30:50.809
In med school you develop
a clinical detachment to death.

30:50.893 --> 30:54.771
In your FBI training
you are confronted with cases...

30:54.855 --> 30:58.150
...the most violent and terrible cases.

30:59.109 --> 31:02.654
You think you can look
into the face of pure evil...

31:04.198 --> 31:07.701
...and then you find yourself paralysed by it.

31:08.368 --> 31:13.999
Are you aware that you've been talking
about yourself in the second person?

31:14.082 --> 31:16.710
No. Was I?

31:17.544 --> 31:20.047
Do you know why?

31:22.216 --> 31:24.301
Um...

31:25.427 --> 31:30.140
Probably as another way
of trying to detach myself from it.

31:30.224 --> 31:33.227
You're a very strong person.

31:33.310 --> 31:38.315
You've probably always felt
you can handle any problem by yourself.

31:38.398 --> 31:40.776
But you feel vulnerable now.

31:40.859 --> 31:43.362
Do you know why that is?

31:44.488 --> 31:45.656
No.

31:47.157 --> 31:50.160
Is it your partner?
Is there a problem with trust?

31:50.244 --> 31:52.329
No.

31:53.205 --> 31:55.749
I trust him as much as anyone.

31:57.042 --> 32:00.003
I trust him with my life.

32:00.087 --> 32:04.049
Can you talk to him about
the way you're feeling?

32:07.719 --> 32:11.849
I don't want him to know
how much this is bothering me.

32:12.933 --> 32:15.018
No.

32:16.144 --> 32:20.107
I don't want him to feel
like he has to protect me.

32:22.192 --> 32:25.153
I know you lost your father last year.

32:26.321 --> 32:31.159
And, uh... I read in your file
that you were very ill recently...

32:31.243 --> 32:33.954
...that your life was threatened.

32:34.496 --> 32:38.584
These exposures can leave you
extremely vulnerable.

32:38.667 --> 32:41.461
I know these things.

32:41.545 --> 32:44.047
I'm... conscious of them.

32:46.508 --> 32:51.972
I know that the world is full of predators,
just as it has always been.

32:52.055 --> 32:56.268
And I know that it is my job
to protect people from them.

32:57.060 --> 33:03.108
And I have counted on that fact
to give me faith in my ability to do what I do.

33:07.112 --> 33:09.615
I want that faith back.

33:12.367 --> 33:14.661
I need it back.

33:19.082 --> 33:20.667
That's great.

33:20.751 --> 33:23.337
- Ah! I've been looking for you.
- I had a meeting.

33:23.420 --> 33:26.882
- I got good news.
- What did you find?

33:26.965 --> 33:30.969
There was nothing on the sheets.
But we pulled something off the body.

33:31.053 --> 33:33.722
The guy cut her fingers off,
but not all of them.

33:33.805 --> 33:36.058
On her right hand, he left a thumb.

33:36.141 --> 33:38.644
I pulled this off the nail polish.

33:39.770 --> 33:44.483
There must've been a struggle before
he killed her-before he put the gloves on.

33:44.566 --> 33:47.194
- I'll call Agent Mulder.
- Somebody called for you.

33:47.277 --> 33:49.279
- Who?
- Said he was an agent in Minneapolis.

33:49.363 --> 33:51.782
I said you had a flight booked back tonight.

33:51.865 --> 33:55.577
- Was it Agent Mulder?
- I didn't recognise the name.

33:55.661 --> 33:59.831
- Did you tell him about the print?
- I hadn't found it yet.

34:00.707 --> 34:03.210
- Mulder.
- Hi, it's me.

34:03.877 --> 34:05.546
We got a print.

34:05.629 --> 34:08.422
- Scully got a print.
- Fantastic!

34:08.507 --> 34:11.176
I'll modem it out to you
to see if you can run a match.

34:11.260 --> 34:15.764
- Are you staying on there, Scully?
- No. I'm coming back tonight.

34:17.181 --> 34:22.020
- Look, I know this is a horrific case, but if...
- I'm OK with it, Mulder.

34:22.103 --> 34:25.065
- Anyway, you could use my help.
- Always.

34:27.234 --> 34:30.571
You or Agent Bocks didn't call
here for me earlier, did you?

34:30.654 --> 34:32.739
Did you call Scully?

34:32.822 --> 34:34.867
No.

34:34.949 --> 34:37.995
- OK. I'll see you when I get there.
- All right.

34:43.792 --> 34:46.128
- FBI!
- I'll take the bedroom!

34:46.879 --> 34:48.338
Move it! Move it! Move it!

34:48.422 --> 34:50.507
- Team two, go!
- Go!

34:51.216 --> 34:55.596
- Team one, what is your status?
- We're clear back here!

34:55.679 --> 34:57.764
Clear!

34:59.516 --> 35:03.687
Bill! I think it's human hair.

35:04.229 --> 35:07.441
Suspect does not appear to be at home.

35:07.524 --> 35:11.987
Let's put out an APB
on Donald Addie Pfaster, age 28.

35:12.070 --> 35:14.239
Moe, take a look at this.

36:15.509 --> 36:18.595
- She should be here.
- She was on the plane.

36:18.679 --> 36:21.181
It landed three hours ago.

36:22.766 --> 36:25.310
We found Agent Scully's car.

36:54.882 --> 36:57.092
She was forced off the road. A white car.

36:57.176 --> 37:00.179
Get a sample of this paint
on a plane to Washington.

37:00.262 --> 37:05.642
If we're lucky, we can get a make and model
of the car by morning. We're gonna find her.

38:20.968 --> 38:23.720
Nothing registered to Donald Pfaster?

38:23.804 --> 38:26.098
Right. Right, got it.

38:28.684 --> 38:30.769
The paint is called Ivory Bone.

38:30.853 --> 38:35.649
It's a two-step enamel used by
three makers of late-model mid-size cars.

38:35.732 --> 38:42.614
They estimate there may be 60,000 cars that
fit that description in the metropolitan area.

38:42.698 --> 38:44.283
- Nothing?
- No.

38:44.366 --> 38:47.494
No one saw her leave the rental agency?
No attendant?

38:47.578 --> 38:49.997
Sorry, Mulder, that's all we got.

38:50.080 --> 38:52.833
People videotape police beatings
on dark streets.

38:52.916 --> 38:55.961
They spot Elvis in three cities
across America every day.

38:56.044 --> 38:59.464
But no one saw a pretty woman
being forced off the road.

38:59.548 --> 39:02.759
He could've taken her anyplace.
How are we gonna find her?

39:02.843 --> 39:06.305
Well, um... We gotta start at the beginning.

39:06.388 --> 39:09.850
As nasty as it might sound,
we gotta get inside this guy's head.

39:09.933 --> 39:12.603
Where would he go?

39:12.686 --> 39:17.024
- Anywhere but his mother's, right?
- Why do you say that?

39:17.357 --> 39:21.820
Being he's so pissed off at her,
from what your profile says.

39:22.905 --> 39:26.241
- Do we know where his mother lives?
- I don't know.

39:26.325 --> 39:27.576
Let's find out.

39:40.881 --> 39:44.301
The mother lives in Boca Raton, Florida.

39:45.427 --> 39:49.932
Correction. She used to live there.
She died a year ago.

39:51.016 --> 39:53.685
Did she have a car registered to her?

39:57.940 --> 40:00.234
Late-model white sedan.

40:01.652 --> 40:03.946
He inherited the car.

40:05.030 --> 40:10.160
Maybe Boca Raton was a winter house.
Does she have a residence in Minneapolis?

40:20.879 --> 40:23.632
Get the hell away from me!

40:51.660 --> 40:53.954
Don't be afraid.

41:05.257 --> 41:07.759
Is your hair normal or dry?

41:14.266 --> 41:16.059
Where are you going?

41:26.236 --> 41:29.656
There's no way out, girlie girl!

41:46.089 --> 41:48.592
I know this house, girlie girl.

41:52.304 --> 41:54.598
There's nowhere to hide.

42:48.402 --> 42:50.237
Move! Move!

42:50.320 --> 42:53.448
Federal agent! Hands in the air!
Hands in the air!

42:58.620 --> 43:01.290
Can we get some paramedics here now!

43:02.165 --> 43:04.668
Just help me get my wrists untied.

43:13.635 --> 43:16.471
- How did you find me?
- His mother owned the house.

43:16.555 --> 43:20.809
Willed it to his sisters.
A patrolman saw his car out back.

43:21.310 --> 43:23.395
Get him outta here.

43:25.522 --> 43:28.150
Sure you don't wanna sit down, Scully?

43:28.233 --> 43:30.402
I'm fine, Mulder.

43:54.051 --> 43:56.136
It's all right.

43:56.678 --> 43:59.848
The conquest of fear
lies in its acceptance...

43:59.932 --> 44:04.937
...in understanding what scares us most is
that which is most familiar and commonplace.

44:05.020 --> 44:07.564
That boy next door, Donnie Pfaster...

44:07.648 --> 44:10.567
...the unremarkable brother
of four older sisters...

44:10.651 --> 44:13.237
...extraordinary only in his ordinariness...

44:13.320 --> 44:16.698
...could grow up to be
the devil in a button-down shirt.

44:16.782 --> 44:21.995

44:22.079 --> 44:27.209

stranger, of footfalls on the stairs...

44:27.292 --> 44:30.546
...the fear of violent death
and the impulse to survive...

44:30.629 --> 44:32.714
...are as frightening as any <font color="#00FF00">X-File</font>.

44:32.798 --> 44:34.800
As real as the acceptance
that it could happen to you.

44:34.842 --> 44:36.635
As real as the acceptance
that it could happen to you.
