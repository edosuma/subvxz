If one of your kids was to show
signs of having superpowers,

00:13.755 --> 00:16.889
would you takes steps to
hide it from the world?

00:16.891 --> 00:18.074
Or would you embrace it?

00:18.076 --> 00:22.478
I think history's proven that
if you reveal having superpowers,

00:22.480 --> 00:23.896
that the government gets involved.

00:23.898 --> 00:25.281
They could take your kid away.

00:25.283 --> 00:26.716
Use it for weaponry.

00:26.718 --> 00:28.451
You know, militarize it.

00:28.453 --> 00:29.819
It depends on what the powers are.

00:29.821 --> 00:32.238

00:36.277 --> 00:37.610
Turn him into a super criminal.

00:37.612 --> 00:38.728
They can go invisible...

00:38.730 --> 00:39.895
I'd be like, "Go invisible.

00:39.897 --> 00:41.464
"Grab the money. Fly on out.

00:41.466 --> 00:42.598

00:42.600 --> 00:44.066
I wouldn't be saying that.

00:44.068 --> 00:45.952
You know what, that's horrible.

00:45.954 --> 00:48.838
I mean, my Dad used
to get me to do that.

06:20.358 --> 06:22.425
What's Phoenix Jones' origin?

Is there some sort of tragedy?

06:23.962 --> 06:26.879
What is it that makes you
wanna go out in the streets?

06:26.881 --> 06:28.231
It starts out with a car break-in,

06:28.233 --> 06:32.218
and the guy put a rock inside a mask,

06:32.220 --> 06:33.569
in the mask in the car, right?

06:33.571 --> 06:35.471
My son and I come running up,

06:35.473 --> 06:37.423
my son falls in the
glass, cuts his leg open,

06:37.425 --> 06:38.975
I call the police, and they're like,

06:38.977 --> 06:40.893
"There's no evidence, it's raining."

06:40.895 --> 06:43.346
Wasn't even gonna send a cop.
The damage was less than $500.

06:43.348 --> 06:44.564
They cited the weather.

06:44.566 --> 06:46.449
Yeah, it was... It was incredible.

06:46.451 --> 06:48.818
So I got kind of mad, I thought,
"This can't be the way it goes."

06:48.820 --> 06:50.152
So I put the mask in my glove box,

06:50.154 --> 06:52.655
I went... I looked at, uh,
crime stats and realized,

06:52.657 --> 06:54.423
"Hey, there's break-ins
here every weekend,"

06:54.425 --> 06:55.775
and went and hung out
in that parking lot

06:55.777 --> 06:57.326
until eventually, we caught this dude

06:57.328 --> 06:58.611
breaking into someone else's car.

06:58.613 --> 07:00.112
So I ran in my car to call 911.

07:00.114 --> 07:01.781
Pick up the phone right
out of my glove box,

07:01.783 --> 07:03.115
and the mask comes out.

07:03.117 --> 07:04.400
And I'm like, "You know what, man,

07:04.402 --> 07:05.868
I got a really, really bad idea."

07:05.870 --> 07:07.336
That's like the bat
flying through the window.

07:07.338 --> 07:08.504
Right, it's like, seize this moment.

07:08.506 --> 07:10.006
So I'm like, "I'm doing it."

07:10.008 --> 07:11.958
When we first started, we'd just
duct taped criminals to poles,

07:11.960 --> 07:13.259
and then roll out,
but the police weren't

07:13.261 --> 07:16.462
prosecuting anybody, so we
weren't really stopping any crime.

07:16.464 --> 07:18.014
And then six months of training,

07:18.016 --> 07:19.215
then you got Phoenix Jones.

07:19.217 --> 07:20.633
Do you have an archenemy?

07:20.635 --> 07:22.218
Do you have, like, a main
villain or someone out there?

07:22.220 --> 07:23.936
Yeah, who's your Joker?

07:23.938 --> 07:25.554
There's been a bunch of super
villains that have arose,

07:25.556 --> 07:26.939
but only one has been real.

07:26.941 --> 07:28.424
There was a guy named Arsonic,

07:28.426 --> 07:30.109
and he would go around and he'd wait

07:30.111 --> 07:31.360
to see us on patrol, and then he'd go

07:31.362 --> 07:32.495
and light buildings on fire.

07:32.497 --> 07:33.863
I mean, he left notes, like,

07:33.865 --> 07:35.431
"You'll never catch me, Phoenix Jones."

07:35.433 --> 07:37.233
- Uh, is he locked away?
- Is he still at large?

07:37.235 --> 07:39.368
No, he lasted like three
days and then we saw this guy

07:39.370 --> 07:41.320
pouring gasoline into a dumpster,

07:41.322 --> 07:43.039
wearing a bowling
shirt with flames on it,

07:43.041 --> 07:45.408
and, like, it's like,
a weird... a weird hat.

07:45.410 --> 07:46.459
You have the type of friends

07:46.461 --> 07:47.543
that it's like,

07:47.545 --> 07:49.178
"Hey, you wanna, like, hang out

07:49.180 --> 07:51.213
in a car and wait to,
like, just get somebody?"

07:51.215 --> 07:52.548
I have friends who are like,

07:52.550 --> 07:53.716
"Hey, you wanna wait till midnight,

07:53.718 --> 07:55.718
when all the new toys come out?"

07:55.720 --> 07:59.138
[laughter]

07:59.140 --> 08:00.339
That's fantastic.

08:00.341 --> 08:02.508
Like, we've all had that dream.

08:02.510 --> 08:04.226
It's just, he actually
went there and did it.

08:04.228 --> 08:05.428
Just think about that for a second.

08:05.430 --> 08:07.730
We live... now live in a world

08:07.732 --> 08:09.732
where people are putting on costumes,

08:09.734 --> 08:11.350
and saying, "I'm gonna
clean up these streets."

08:11.352 --> 08:13.903
He's committed to
actually doing some good.

08:13.905 --> 08:15.187
You know, we're all
like, "We wanna do good."

08:15.189 --> 08:17.440
Until people are like, "You
wanna get stabbed for it?"

08:17.442 --> 08:18.491
You're like, "No, no, no."

08:18.493 --> 08:21.027
[laughter]

08:21.029 --> 08:24.180
How... How do the authorities
treat Phoenix Jones?

08:24.182 --> 08:25.865
Do they welcome your help?

08:25.867 --> 08:27.500
The first year was like Spider-Man.

08:27.502 --> 08:30.086
The district attorney said I was
a deeply misguided individual,

08:30.088 --> 08:31.754
and that... that then I would be

08:31.756 --> 08:33.371
de-masked and apprehended.

08:33.374 --> 08:34.874
And it was super great.

08:34.876 --> 08:36.125
J. Jonah Jameson.

08:36.126 --> 08:38.527
But after we stopped the riot,
then after that they were...

08:38.529 --> 08:40.513
- We had nothing but good stuff.
- Really?

08:40.515 --> 08:41.797
It's highly exaggerated,

08:41.799 --> 08:43.015
uh, but that's what the
government called it.

08:43.017 --> 08:45.017
- How?
- Bunch of guys started a riot

08:45.019 --> 08:48.137
in our city on May Day, and the police
didn't listen to us, when we were like,

08:48.139 --> 08:50.172
"Yo, these guys said they're
gonna "go to the Federal building,

08:50.174 --> 08:51.407
and try to throw a bomb in it."

08:51.409 --> 08:53.109
So me and a couple others, right,

08:53.111 --> 08:54.643
hopped in the Kia of Justice
and peeled out over there.

08:54.645 --> 08:57.413
35 guys in black masks
start storming the building,

08:57.415 --> 08:58.531
and we're in a fistfight
with these guys,

08:58.533 --> 09:00.316
like outside the building.

09:00.318 --> 09:04.120
<i>[heavy rock music]</i>

09:04.122 --> 09:07.239
They toss this backpack into the
building, had a pipe bomb in it.

09:07.241 --> 09:08.791
So we grab the backpack

09:08.793 --> 09:10.493
and throw it out in the
middle of the street,

09:10.495 --> 09:12.428
and security pulls up, and I
figured we're going to jail.

09:12.430 --> 09:13.879
They've got, like, shotguns,
and they're super serious.

09:13.881 --> 09:15.081
A guy rolls up and he's like,

09:15.083 --> 09:16.465
"Phoenix, we love your work, man."

09:16.467 --> 09:18.718
Shakes my hand, we hopped in the car,

09:18.720 --> 09:20.136
they arrested like
three different people,

09:20.138 --> 09:22.888
and then we got a little
plaque. It's kind of funny.

09:22.890 --> 09:24.590
- That's amazing.
- That's all very impressive.

09:24.592 --> 09:26.275
Did you say "the Kia of Justice"?

09:26.277 --> 09:28.260
- Yeah, 'cause they...
- Okay, I thought so.

09:28.262 --> 09:30.679
I thought that's what you said.

09:30.681 --> 09:33.065
Phoenix is no poser.

09:33.067 --> 09:36.102
He will jump in and beat
your ass if you're a criminal.

09:36.104 --> 09:38.104
Like Batman, basically.

09:38.106 --> 09:39.488
Absolutely.

09:39.490 --> 09:40.906
You put on a mask and do some good...

09:40.908 --> 09:42.691
Very few people in
the world who do that.

09:42.693 --> 09:45.244
Most of them are fictional
characters in comic books.

09:45.246 --> 09:47.079
So if somebody does it in real life,

09:47.081 --> 09:48.998
they get that from me.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.466
We've had this conversation

09:50.468 --> 09:53.169
amongst our ourselves hundreds of times.

09:53.171 --> 09:55.921
Do you think that we
could put on costumes,

09:55.923 --> 09:58.591
superhero suits, and
go make a difference

09:58.593 --> 09:59.809
on the streets of Red Bank?

09:59.811 --> 10:00.843
Seriously?

10:00.845 --> 10:02.845
This is a town that could use
a little bit of cleaning up.

10:02.847 --> 10:04.980
This sounds awesome.
If you guys are serious,

10:04.982 --> 10:06.215
I'm gonna be here on Saturday.

10:06.217 --> 10:07.950
We will go out, we will fight crime,

10:07.952 --> 10:09.518
suited up in Red Bank.

10:09.520 --> 10:10.853
I got my name picked out.

10:10.855 --> 10:14.523
I've been waiting my whole life
to design my own superhero costume.

10:14.525 --> 10:16.058
- Challenge accepted.
- All right.

10:16.060 --> 10:17.526
That's the plan.

10:17.528 --> 10:19.812
Saturday: suits, outfits, patrol.

10:19.814 --> 10:23.265
Trust us... trust us, we got the skills.

10:23.267 --> 10:24.450
All right, I'm excited.

10:24.452 --> 10:28.704
I serve up justice in a trough.

10:28.706 --> 10:29.772
- All: Oh!
- Yes!

10:29.774 --> 10:30.773
Now I'm pumped!

10:33.061 --> 10:34.785
I've been shot and
stabbed a couple times.

10:34.976 --> 10:36.309
The first time I got shot was over here,

10:36.311 --> 10:37.627
and I thought I would be fine.

10:37.629 --> 10:39.262
I was wearing a bulletproof vest.

10:39.264 --> 10:41.097
I'm dressed like a
superhero, I got spandex on.

10:41.099 --> 10:42.432
This is gonna be great.

10:42.434 --> 10:43.483
So I'm running and this guy shoots,

10:43.485 --> 10:44.984
and I'm like, "Got this."

10:44.986 --> 10:47.704
And I'm like, "Oh..."
I just, like, fell down.

10:47.706 --> 10:49.072
I rolled under a dumpster and, like,

10:49.074 --> 10:50.740
cleared the round out

10:50.742 --> 10:53.359
because it's hot, and if you leave
it in there, it'll burn you, right.

10:53.361 --> 10:56.162
So I cleared the round out, roll up
in this dumpster and just passed out.

10:56.164 --> 10:58.081
Woke up like six hours
later, broken ribs,

10:58.083 --> 10:59.582
couldn't breathe, it was embarrassing.

10:59.584 --> 11:01.084
Then I went and bought
expensive body armor.

11:01.086 --> 11:02.285
So the second time when I got shot,

11:02.287 --> 11:03.786
I was imagining the worst.

11:03.788 --> 11:05.588
So as I'm running I
hear the shots go out.

11:05.590 --> 11:07.090
It hits me and I'm like,
"It's gonna hurt so bad."

11:07.092 --> 11:08.791
And then I'm like, "Oh... I'm fine."

11:08.793 --> 11:10.093
I just kept running, chased
him down and caught him.

11:10.095 --> 11:12.879
- It was nothing.
- Could you imagine?

11:12.881 --> 11:14.297
That... being like... Just getting shot?

11:14.299 --> 11:15.548
And then be like, "Oh, I'm okay."

11:15.550 --> 11:17.183
The first part, yes.

11:17.185 --> 11:18.434
The second part, not so much.

11:18.436 --> 11:19.435
[laughter]

11:30.451 --> 11:31.116
How you doing?

11:31.116 --> 11:33.950
Hey, can I check out that copy of
"Son of Satan" up there on the wall?

11:33.952 --> 11:35.168
Absolutely.

11:35.170 --> 11:36.569
- Ming, would you grab that?
- Yeah.

11:36.571 --> 11:38.288
- You a big "Son of Satan" fan?
- Oh, yeah.

11:38.290 --> 11:39.989
It's one of the first
books I bought back in 1975.

11:39.991 --> 11:41.291
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:41.293 --> 11:42.388
Can't believe you guys have it.

11:42.388 --> 11:43.877
- Sweet.
- There you go.

11:43.879 --> 11:45.628
"Son of Satan" Number 1.

11:45.630 --> 11:48.648
<i>[heavy rock music]</i>

11:48.650 --> 11:53.186
<i>♪ ♪</i>

11:53.188 --> 11:54.821
When this book came out in the '70s,

11:54.823 --> 11:56.422
the devil was everywhere, man.

11:56.424 --> 11:58.258
It was just on the
heels of "The Exorcist."

11:58.260 --> 12:01.394
The company that gave us
Spider-Man and Fantastic Four,

12:01.396 --> 12:04.681
is now dabbling in the
occult, and pushing Satan?

12:04.683 --> 12:05.865
It was unheard of.

12:05.867 --> 12:07.317
But does Satan ever show up?

12:07.319 --> 12:08.318
Oh, yeah.

12:08.320 --> 12:09.736
It was father versus son.

12:09.738 --> 12:10.970
The son was good.

12:10.972 --> 12:12.405
Satan, obviously, was the bad guy,

12:12.407 --> 12:13.857
and wherever his tentacles

12:13.859 --> 12:15.441
and six fingers were,

12:15.443 --> 12:17.143
Daimon Hellstrom was there

12:17.145 --> 12:18.745
to balance the scales a little bit,

12:18.747 --> 12:21.030
and kick his daddy's ass.

12:21.032 --> 12:22.198
Now you know,

12:22.200 --> 12:24.033
I'm the biggest Satan

12:24.035 --> 12:25.618
fan around.

12:25.620 --> 12:27.787
That's what it says on his
card. Walt Flanagan, Satan fan.

12:27.789 --> 12:29.506
[laughter]

12:29.508 --> 12:32.959
In my opinion, that Satan was
never more popular than in the '70s.

12:32.961 --> 12:35.211
That's the thing, he
was always in the Bible,

12:35.213 --> 12:36.546
but he was always kind of lame, I guess.

12:36.548 --> 12:39.182
But in the '70s, Hollywood took him.

12:39.184 --> 12:41.134
Like, he's in a little girl
and he's spinning her head.

12:41.136 --> 12:42.886
Or he's in a little boy
who's killing his mom.

12:42.888 --> 12:43.970
He was on TV.

12:43.972 --> 12:45.972
- Starsky and Hutch even fought...
- They fought the devil.

12:45.974 --> 12:47.056
That's right.

12:47.058 --> 12:48.775
[laughter]

12:48.777 --> 12:50.443
I just can't believe you guys have it.

12:50.445 --> 12:51.911
I could pick up something
like this on the Internet,

12:51.913 --> 12:53.062
but that's no fun.

12:53.064 --> 12:55.031
As a collector, I love the hunt,

12:55.033 --> 12:56.533
and to have this now in my hands,

12:56.535 --> 12:58.985
after searching for
years, it's gratifying.

12:58.987 --> 13:01.187
Yeah, but with all the
tools at your disposal,

13:01.189 --> 13:02.956
you save all that time.

13:02.958 --> 13:05.408
You could've just... Bam, done.

13:05.410 --> 13:06.859
It just baffles me

13:06.861 --> 13:08.578
that with all the technology available,

13:08.580 --> 13:09.746
you'll still go out.

13:09.748 --> 13:12.131
You'll still put on clothes...

13:12.133 --> 13:14.133
Generally, yeah, that's preferred.

13:14.135 --> 13:16.386
This guy is keeping you in business.

13:16.388 --> 13:17.971
Keeping you employed!

13:17.973 --> 13:19.305
You're like, "Dummy, go get it online."

13:19.307 --> 13:20.723
You'd lose a job, dude.

13:20.725 --> 13:23.810
I guess, but I mean, in this day and age,
he could've easily bought this online.

13:23.812 --> 13:25.311
But that's... you gotta
respect the hunt, man.

13:25.313 --> 13:26.846
The idea of venturing out,

13:26.848 --> 13:29.065
that's part of the
reason we're friends, man.

13:29.067 --> 13:30.934
It is kind of expeditious.

13:30.936 --> 13:34.771
We were like Lewis and Clark.

13:34.773 --> 13:37.240
The only way that we could've had a more

13:37.242 --> 13:38.524
adventurous time finding comics,

13:38.526 --> 13:40.860
is if we had done it by balloon.

13:40.862 --> 13:43.496
Yes, which we talked about many times.

13:43.498 --> 13:46.115
80 books in 80 days, baby.

13:46.117 --> 13:47.917
[laughter]

13:47.919 --> 13:51.087
So we are looking to get $35.

13:51.089 --> 13:54.090
Uh, should I wrap her up?

13:54.092 --> 13:57.293
It's a very nice copy.

13:57.295 --> 13:58.928
Make this marvel mine.

13:58.930 --> 14:01.748
Oh, throw up some horns for the man.

14:01.750 --> 14:04.550
Ah! [chuckles]

14:04.552 --> 14:06.469
- All right, man, thank you.
- Thank you.

14:06.471 --> 14:08.137
Now, there's something
you don't see every day.

14:08.139 --> 14:10.356
What, a guy who was just
like, "Here's the money."

14:10.358 --> 14:12.725
[laughter]

14:18.950 --> 14:21.134
- Hey, you guys.
- Oh!

14:21.136 --> 14:22.285
What do you think?

14:22.287 --> 14:23.569
You guys put it together well.

14:23.571 --> 14:24.988
We are ready to strike fear

14:24.990 --> 14:26.706
into the criminals.

14:26.708 --> 14:29.575
[laughs] Spandex will
definitely do that.

14:29.577 --> 14:32.912
Phoenix agreed to take
us out on a patrol,

14:32.914 --> 14:34.580
and he gave us a week to come up with

14:34.582 --> 14:35.999
our superhero identities.

14:36.001 --> 14:37.383
Who better than all of us?

14:37.385 --> 14:39.302
Guys who been reading
comics their whole lives.

14:39.304 --> 14:41.921
We were born to walk the
streets and protect them.

14:41.923 --> 14:43.556
You're absolutely right about that.

14:43.558 --> 14:45.558
I've heard the New York
City Police Department

14:45.560 --> 14:47.894
is gonna get rid of the Police Academy,

14:47.896 --> 14:48.928
because now that everyone's

14:48.930 --> 14:50.396
reading comic books,

14:50.398 --> 14:52.098
they know how to confront evil

14:52.100 --> 14:53.132
in the streets.

14:53.134 --> 14:54.400
You gotta go through

14:54.402 --> 14:55.902
and tell me what your inspirations were.

14:55.904 --> 14:57.437
My name is Number Four.

14:57.439 --> 14:59.739
You have the pig who built
his house out of straw,

14:59.741 --> 15:01.574
the pig who built his
house out of sticks,

15:01.576 --> 15:03.326
the one who built it out of bricks,

15:03.328 --> 15:06.279
and then the fourth one
who just took the wolf on.

15:06.281 --> 15:07.580
Oh.

15:07.582 --> 15:08.648
Oh, okay.

15:08.650 --> 15:10.616
I serve up justice...

15:10.618 --> 15:12.618
in a trough.

15:12.620 --> 15:13.720
- All: Oh!
- Oh, yes!

15:13.722 --> 15:15.088
Now I'm pumped.

15:15.090 --> 15:16.372
Yes!

15:16.374 --> 15:18.207
- All right.
- Very nice. Me?

15:18.209 --> 15:19.292
Yeah.

15:19.294 --> 15:20.927
I am the El Negotiator.

15:20.929 --> 15:22.211
I was once

15:22.213 --> 15:24.047
a mild-mannered store clerk,

15:24.049 --> 15:25.682
who tried to stuff one too many bill

15:25.684 --> 15:27.767
into the cash register,
until it exploded in my face.

15:27.769 --> 15:29.552
Horribly scarred,

15:29.554 --> 15:33.356
I now must wear this
mask and fight crime.

15:33.358 --> 15:35.058
[laughter]

15:35.060 --> 15:37.043
- It's fair enough.
- Speechless, right?

15:37.045 --> 15:38.411
Cool. Who are you?

15:38.413 --> 15:40.229
Gun: Guy with the useless knowledge.

15:40.231 --> 15:42.115
I know everything there is to know

15:42.117 --> 15:44.200
about anything that
you don't wanna know.

15:44.202 --> 15:46.536
Especially spelling,
since knowledge is with K.

15:46.538 --> 15:48.588
I'm going phonetically, pig!

15:48.590 --> 15:50.873
I like it.

15:50.875 --> 15:52.458
All right, Ming.

15:52.460 --> 15:53.576
Listen, I'm going old-school here.

15:53.578 --> 15:55.395
And no, I have no illusions

15:55.397 --> 15:57.880
of busting heads or, you know,
I have no fight experience.
