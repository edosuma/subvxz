Great pastry to whet your appetite.

01:09.875 --> 01:14.583

What? How?

03:09.625 --> 03:10.875
That's impossible.

03:10.958 --> 03:14.583
It was black magic.
Shall I assemble the army, sir?

03:14.666 --> 03:17.166
No, we don't need any panic.

03:17.250 --> 03:19.833
Keep what happened as a strict secret.

03:19.916 --> 03:25.166

we must turn to the SMCA.

you run a smuggling operation.

Believe me, there must be some mistake.

05:50.916 --> 05:52.166
But still!

05:52.250 --> 05:54.833
You're keeping magical creatures in cages?

05:54.916 --> 05:56.041
This is forbidden.

05:56.125 --> 05:58.000
Oh, what are you talkin' about?

05:58.083 --> 05:59.125
What cages?

05:59.208 --> 06:00.750
These are their houses.

06:00.833 --> 06:02.916
They're absolutely happy here.

Have you found the king?

06:45.416 --> 06:47.750
We have checked into
all wizards and witches,

everyone who wields some magic,

06:50.041 --> 06:53.041
with a license and without,
but all in vain.

There's only one last trail left.

06:56.208 --> 07:00.166
Special Agent Gretel,
have you managed to find the kidnappers?

07:00.250 --> 07:01.625
No, Agent Stepmother.

07:01.708 --> 07:03.083
It was a false trail.

07:03.166 --> 07:05.541
-[Gretel] We're at a dead end.
-[banging]

07:05.625 --> 07:09.333
We are just missing something.
Something right in plain sight.

07:09.916 --> 07:12.583
Then we need to see it
from a different angle.

07:12.666 --> 07:16.250
We could use the help of someone
who's done something of this kind.

07:16.333 --> 07:18.625
Done what? Found kidnapped kings?

07:18.708 --> 07:21.958
No, someone who's kidnapped
someone in the daylight,

07:22.041 --> 07:23.666
someone who tricked people,

07:23.750 --> 07:25.000
took them for a ride,

07:25.083 --> 07:27.041
made complete idiots out of them.

07:27.125 --> 07:29.791
I can't really understand
where this is going.

07:29.875 --> 07:31.666
Oh, I do! I understand!

07:31.750 --> 07:33.166
It's about Master Hansel.

07:33.250 --> 07:35.583
Remember when he stole
the statue of the king

07:35.666 --> 07:38.041
-from the Central Square?
-[gasping]

07:38.125 --> 07:41.041
Exactly!
The whole kingdom was just going crazy.

07:41.125 --> 07:42.958
-Searching high and low.
-[sirens]

07:43.041 --> 07:45.833
Yeah, and remember
how smartly he returned it?

07:45.916 --> 07:47.958
Made such big fools out of us all?

07:48.041 --> 07:51.041
People believe he is
the greatest wizard in the kingdom.

07:51.125 --> 07:54.166
Stop it! He's nothing but a charlatan.

07:54.250 --> 07:55.458
[somber music plays]

07:55.541 --> 07:58.333
You do understand,
if the king is not present

07:58.416 --> 08:02.916
at his birthday celebration in two days,
it will lead to panic, chaos,

08:03.000 --> 08:04.416
and more panic.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.708
You need to explore
every possible alternative.

08:08.208 --> 08:09.458
[sighing]

08:09.541 --> 08:10.583
Okay.

08:18.416 --> 08:19.500
Aye, ma'am.

08:19.583 --> 08:22.083
Arrest Hansel immediately
and bring him to me.

08:23.083 --> 08:23.958
Aye, ma'am.

08:26.916 --> 08:29.250
You think he's going to cooperate?

08:29.333 --> 08:30.625
Be sure that he will.

08:30.708 --> 08:32.791
Agent Gretel is his sister.

08:32.875 --> 08:37.625
-But will she arrest her own brother?
-Of course, she's a ruthless professional,

08:37.708 --> 08:40.208
and her dream is to become the Best Agent.

She puts her duties above her family.

09:06.166 --> 09:09.583
I am Master Hansel!

09:09.666 --> 09:13.708
My hands have been scorched
by the flames of chaos

09:13.791 --> 09:17.791
and haven't been harmed
by any other fire since then.

09:17.875 --> 09:21.291
My eyes have been blinded
by the heavenly bodies,

09:21.375 --> 09:25.875
and ever since, they can see
farther than any mortal eyes.

09:25.958 --> 09:27.291
[crowd gasping]

09:27.375 --> 09:30.916
I know you have no power
over the coming future,

09:31.000 --> 09:34.750
but I can prophesy it and help you.

09:34.833 --> 09:36.166

[lively music plays]

09:39.541 --> 09:40.708

What is that disgusting thing?

-This used to be a normal rabbit…
-[sighs]

09:59.875 --> 10:02.916
…innocently living
on a farm on the edge of town.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.750
Then the farmer had an issue

10:04.833 --> 10:06.541
-with a sorceress.
-[giggling]

10:06.625 --> 10:09.291
One thing led to another,
next thing you know,

10:09.375 --> 10:11.333
the farmer's property gets hit

10:11.416 --> 10:13.041
-with a jinx!
-[organ plays]

10:13.125 --> 10:17.291
-A jinx? Oh, no! That's terrible!
-How awful! What can we do?

10:17.375 --> 10:21.958
Yes! But only if you don't
have a protective ebony amulet,

10:22.041 --> 10:24.083
the wood from the bewitched swamps

10:24.166 --> 10:26.416
-of the Miracle Forest.
-[crowd gasps]

10:26.500 --> 10:29.500
Or a yew amulet
from the Forbidden Mountains,

10:29.583 --> 10:31.250
or the Norwegian boxwood,

10:31.333 --> 10:34.625
unearthed from
the Forever Fjord of the Fairies.

10:34.708 --> 10:37.416

Wow! The Norwegian boxwood amulet!

10:37.500 --> 10:39.916
I've been dreaming of this my whole life!

10:40.000 --> 10:45.166
The owner of this amulet
has no fear of any kind of jinx.

I have a huge household
and I don't need any kind of trouble.

11:10.375 --> 11:11.916
I'm so gracious.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.666
I also accept jewelry
and precious stones over two carats.

11:16.833 --> 11:19.750
-[woman laughing] So jealous!
-I'm so happy!

11:19.833 --> 11:26.083
[Hansel] Goodbye. Have a great day.
May the power of the amulets protect you.

-I feel better already!

11:33.208 --> 11:35.125
-[female voice] Excuse me.
-Uh!

11:35.208 --> 11:37.666
-How did you--
-I'm sorry, Master Hansel.

11:38.166 --> 11:40.291
I just waited for everyone to leave.

11:40.833 --> 11:43.583
Could you please
lend me one of your amulets?

11:44.583 --> 11:47.666
I'm an orphan,
my little sister has fallen badly ill.

11:47.750 --> 11:48.916
[baby coughing]

11:49.000 --> 11:50.583
I can't afford a doctor,

11:51.250 --> 11:53.583
so your amulet is the only hope.

11:56.833 --> 11:57.791
No.

11:57.875 --> 12:01.916
The thing is, these amulets,
the magic doesn't work on children.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.333
-So, what should I do?
-[Hansel sighing]

12:06.416 --> 12:09.041
I do have some magic gold coins.

12:09.125 --> 12:11.083
They'll help you pay for a doctor

12:11.166 --> 12:14.166
and anything else you and your sister
need on your own.

12:14.250 --> 12:15.375
Oh.

12:15.458 --> 12:17.833
Thank you so much, Master Hansel.

12:17.916 --> 12:20.875
But remember,
if you tell anyone that it was me

12:20.958 --> 12:23.041
that gave you these magic coins,

12:23.125 --> 12:24.625
they'll turn into dust.

12:24.708 --> 12:27.166
We won't tell anyone. Thank you.

12:28.916 --> 12:29.833
[knocking]

12:30.458 --> 12:32.416
What now? Uh--

12:32.500 --> 12:33.333
Hansel.

12:34.041 --> 12:35.333
Gretel?

12:35.416 --> 12:36.291
Uh…

12:36.375 --> 12:38.791
-Sister!
-You're under arrest.

-[gasping]
-Hands in the air.

12:46.625 --> 12:49.666
Come on, sis.
This is no way to treat family.

12:49.750 --> 12:52.583
Let's sit down, have some tea, catch up.

12:53.166 --> 12:55.500
I'm just gonna go put the kettle on.

12:56.750 --> 12:57.708
[Hansel gasping]

12:58.166 --> 13:01.291
-You can't fool me.
-What are you arresting me for?

13:01.375 --> 13:05.500
If it's because of the flying carpet,
everyone saw it flying when I sold it.

13:06.458 --> 13:09.458
Huh?
Is the genie not coming out of the bottle?

13:10.500 --> 13:12.750
Maybe you're rubbing it the wrong way.

13:12.833 --> 13:14.000
Agh!

13:14.083 --> 13:15.416
Stop where you are.

13:16.541 --> 13:18.833
So much for the family reunion.

13:20.833 --> 13:22.041

13:43.708 --> 13:44.625
It's the law.

14:08.250 --> 14:12.541
Welcome! Oh, is the young man
afraid of having his hair cut?

14:12.625 --> 14:16.041
The young man wants a hairstyle
that will open up his inner world.

14:16.125 --> 14:18.125
-Huh?
-That's the password.

14:18.208 --> 14:19.041

[music crescendos]

14:57.750 --> 15:00.375
[Hansel] So this is really where you work?

Wow!

[clanking]

15:19.208 --> 15:22.416
You. Careful, that class of broom
is unpredictable.

15:22.500 --> 15:25.375
Double up on the restraints,

[melodic string music plays]

15:58.458 --> 15:59.291
Good morning.

15:59.375 --> 16:03.416
I am Agent Stepmother,
Head of the Secret Magic Control Agency.

16:04.333 --> 16:05.666
Nice to meet you.

16:05.750 --> 16:09.333
I'm Hansel, an honest and innocent person.

16:09.416 --> 16:10.875
[boots clacking]

16:10.958 --> 16:13.208
[Stepmother] Release him.
Three days ago,

16:13.291 --> 16:17.291
our king was kidnapped
right from his palace by magical means.

16:17.375 --> 16:19.166
I haven't kidnapped your king!

16:19.250 --> 16:21.958
I took that statue a while back,
I returned it.

16:22.041 --> 16:25.083
It was just a little trick
to advertise my business.

16:25.708 --> 16:27.750
That's exactly why you're here.

16:27.833 --> 16:30.666
[Stepmother] Our best agents
have failed to find the kidnapper,

16:30.750 --> 16:32.208
and time is running out.

16:32.291 --> 16:36.291
If the king is not present
at his birthday celebration in two days,

16:36.916 --> 16:38.875
we'll have total anarchy.

16:38.958 --> 16:41.250
We need someone like you,

16:41.333 --> 16:45.125
someone who can see the situation
from the thief's point of view.

16:45.833 --> 16:49.083
What?
You're turning to this traitor for help?

16:49.166 --> 16:50.500
I'm a traitor?

16:50.583 --> 16:53.958
Yes! Our parents were
teaching us to be honest

16:54.041 --> 16:55.750
and fight against evil,

16:55.833 --> 16:59.958
but you betrayed our family
and became a charlatan.

17:00.041 --> 17:03.541
As far as I'm concerned,
I don't have a brother.

17:03.625 --> 17:05.416
Oh! And wasn't it our parents

17:05.500 --> 17:08.625
who were also teaching us
not to forget your family?

17:08.708 --> 17:09.541
Enough!

17:09.625 --> 17:12.666
Save the family squabble
for the holiday dinner table.

17:13.250 --> 17:15.291
You two have to work together.

-What?
-[lively music plays]

17:17.875 --> 17:19.291
No. No way.

17:19.375 --> 17:20.500
This is so stupid!

17:20.583 --> 17:22.791
We can't stand each other!

17:22.875 --> 17:25.958
[Hansel] Exactly!

I'm not asking you for a favor,
Master Hansel.

-[buzzing]
-It's going to be easy for us to expose

17:34.750 --> 17:36.750
every single trick you've ever pulled.

17:36.833 --> 17:42.041
Every resident of our kingdom will know
that you're nothing but a charlatan.

17:42.125 --> 17:45.125
[Stepmother] You'll end up
on the street, penniless,

17:45.208 --> 17:47.500
no easy life for you anymore.

17:47.583 --> 17:48.791
[somber music plays]

17:48.875 --> 17:50.916
And as for you, Agent Gretel,

17:51.000 --> 17:53.833
you missed your chance
to find the king yourself.

17:54.416 --> 17:57.208
So, if you fail to fulfill my order again,

17:57.291 --> 18:01.625
there's no way for you to achieve
the title of Best Agent.

18:01.708 --> 18:05.500
You'll serve coffee around the agency
till the end of your days.

18:05.583 --> 18:06.416
[gasping]

18:08.250 --> 18:11.208
So much negative energy coming off her.

18:11.291 --> 18:14.083
But if you still manage to find the king,

18:14.166 --> 18:15.375
Master Hansel,

18:15.458 --> 18:19.083
I'll grant you a license
of an 80th-level sorcerer.

18:19.666 --> 18:21.125
And you, Agent Gretel,

18:21.208 --> 18:22.583
you will get promoted,

18:22.666 --> 18:26.000
and the title
of Best Agent of the Kingdom.

18:26.583 --> 18:30.125
For that kind of license,
I wouldn't just find the king,

18:30.208 --> 18:32.291
I'd find you the Invisible Man!

18:32.375 --> 18:35.333
Okay, sister, just like old times, huh?

18:35.416 --> 18:37.541
How about our secret handshake?

18:37.625 --> 18:41.750
[Stepmother] See Agent Stepdaughter.
She'll equip you with everything you need.

18:41.833 --> 18:42.958
Aye, ma'am.

18:43.041 --> 18:44.166
Good luck.

18:44.250 --> 18:46.750
The fate of the kingdom depends on you.

18:47.958 --> 18:48.791
Eh?

18:50.208 --> 18:51.208
[Hansel] Oof!

18:51.875 --> 18:53.416
Oops, I missed.

18:54.208 --> 18:56.708

since we were kids.

19:00.916 --> 19:03.250
I can't believe we're working together!

19:03.333 --> 19:06.125
You're a hustler, a cheat, a con artist,

19:06.208 --> 19:07.250
and a charlatan.

19:07.333 --> 19:10.250
I'm sorry, all I heard was "artist."

19:11.416 --> 19:15.375
Remember, I work alone,
so just stay out of my way.

you can swipe not just the king,

I'd say "wipe" rather than "swipe,"
as in completely wipe out. [laughs]

That's why they're here
in the most secure facility ever built.

22:06.875 --> 22:10.041
These are our specially-designed glasses.

22:10.125 --> 22:13.791
They allow you to see any signs of magic.
Try them on.

22:13.875 --> 22:17.958
Only, you can't look through them for long
or it'll damage your eyes.

22:18.041 --> 22:20.541
Just take a quick look
and take them off.

22:21.458 --> 22:24.166
[Gretel gasping]
Hey, empty your pockets.

22:24.250 --> 22:25.083
Mm…

22:25.166 --> 22:27.916
It wasn't me.
Somebody must have planted those.

22:28.416 --> 22:29.625
Uh. Was it you?

22:29.708 --> 22:30.583
Huh?

22:30.666 --> 22:33.500
-[adventurous music plays]
-[whirring, clanking]

22:33.583 --> 22:35.833
And this is a magic watch.

22:35.916 --> 22:37.833
It has absolutely everything,

22:37.916 --> 22:41.166
a compass, scissors, a hand saw,

22:41.250 --> 22:42.708
and lipstick!

22:42.791 --> 22:43.875
[kissing]

22:43.958 --> 22:46.166
This will help you get into anywhere.

22:46.666 --> 22:47.500
Look!

22:48.333 --> 22:49.875
[splashing, crackling]

22:50.541 --> 22:51.708
-Huh!
-Wow!

22:52.375 --> 22:53.416
-Hm.
-Oh boy!

22:53.500 --> 22:56.250
-[air rushing, clunking]

22:56.333 --> 22:57.833

22:57.916 --> 23:00.041
-Hey!
-[burbling and squishing]

23:00.916 --> 23:02.333
-[crackling]
-Agh!

23:02.416 --> 23:04.791
The effect is temporary, a few seconds.

23:04.875 --> 23:06.458
-[Hansel chuckling]
-Huh!

23:06.541 --> 23:07.458
[Hansel] Heh!

23:07.541 --> 23:09.458
[Gretel gasping]

23:10.041 --> 23:12.291
[laughing] I knew you had no heart.

23:14.125 --> 23:16.708
This is specifically for newbies like you.

23:19.083 --> 23:20.541
[ringing]

23:20.625 --> 23:24.166
Anti-stray pebbles.
You'll never go astray if you have 'em.

23:25.083 --> 23:25.916
Here!

23:26.000 --> 23:27.791
[Hansel] Huh-ah! Ugh!

23:28.416 --> 23:32.750
Now the most important thing.
The results from our crime scene analysis.

23:32.833 --> 23:36.458
I found traces of an ingredient that
I believe brought the king's food to life.

23:37.041 --> 23:40.333
Hmm. [gasping]
And just five minutes ago, I built this!

23:40.416 --> 23:43.000
[static buzzing and ringing]

23:43.583 --> 23:47.208
Incredible! You formulated a reagent.

23:47.791 --> 23:48.750
She did what?

23:49.250 --> 23:53.500
Think of it as a tracking device.
It can lead us to the mystery ingredient.

23:53.583 --> 23:55.750
Yeah, I'm a genius!

23:55.833 --> 23:58.708
Here's a list of ingredient suppliers
to the king's kitchen.

23:58.791 --> 24:01.083
-[Stepdaughter chuckling]
-Hmm.

24:01.166 --> 24:04.416
This one at the bottom,
the Sugar and Spice Shop.

24:04.500 --> 24:06.625
It's in the sketchiest part of town.

24:06.708 --> 24:09.791
That's where I'd run things
if I was trying to stay under the radar.

24:09.875 --> 24:12.291
Thanks for your criminal expertise.

24:12.375 --> 24:14.541
Hey, just trying to earn my keep.

24:14.625 --> 24:17.541
We'll stake it out.
Great job, Agent Stepdaughter.

24:17.625 --> 24:18.458
Thank you.

24:18.541 --> 24:20.083
Okay, time to go.

24:20.166 --> 24:23.125
Yes, thank you for everything.

24:23.666 --> 24:25.833
-Good luck!
-To you as well!

24:25.916 --> 24:26.833
[door slamming]

24:27.750 --> 24:29.958

24:41.583 --> 24:42.500
[woman] Ahh!

24:43.875 --> 24:45.541
Almost ready.

24:45.625 --> 24:48.041
Vanilla, I need more vanilla.

24:50.125 --> 24:51.250
[chimes ringing]

24:51.833 --> 24:52.833
That's it?

24:52.916 --> 24:54.958
Where's the rest of my vanilla?

24:55.041 --> 24:56.583
[speaking gibberish]

24:56.666 --> 24:59.333
-What? They've been taken captive?
-[grunting]

24:59.416 --> 25:02.541
-I don't need your excuses!
-[yelping, gasping]

25:02.625 --> 25:05.875
-I need vanilla.
-[suspenseful music crescendos]

25:06.458 --> 25:08.666
[General screaming]

25:09.375 --> 25:10.208
Hm.

25:10.791 --> 25:12.666
Now, you're the general.

25:12.750 --> 25:14.791
Don't disappoint me.

25:15.458 --> 25:18.166
[General grunting]

25:18.250 --> 25:19.083
Huh?

25:46.291 --> 25:47.958
-Uh. Huh?
-Ah!

25:48.541 --> 25:50.541
Finally, you're here.

25:51.041 --> 25:53.250
[jazz music plays]

25:53.333 --> 25:55.833
[cupcakes grunting]

25:55.916 --> 25:58.458
[woman] Oh, my sweet king!

25:58.541 --> 26:02.416
Never have a falling out
with your bread and butter, right?

26:02.500 --> 26:05.541
I'm so happy you're finally paying a visit

26:05.625 --> 26:07.583
-to my humble house.
-[groaning]

26:07.666 --> 26:09.666
Let's celebrate with a feast!

-[bubbling]
-[king grunting]

26:18.541 --> 26:22.000
Wha-- What is the meaning of this?

26:22.083 --> 26:22.916
[clanging]

26:23.000 --> 26:26.250
[king gasping]
Is this what you feed to the king?

26:26.833 --> 26:30.875
They say the way to a man's heart
is through his stomach.

26:30.958 --> 26:33.958
-Now, try my lovely soup.
-[echoing ringing]

26:34.041 --> 26:34.916
Gnah!

26:35.000 --> 26:36.250
This isn't soup.

26:36.333 --> 26:37.750
It's black magic!

26:37.833 --> 26:38.916
-Out!
-[Ilvira gasps]

26:39.000 --> 26:42.625
Get out of my kingdom!
Never set foot in here again!

26:42.708 --> 26:45.083
You're banished forever!

26:45.166 --> 26:47.791
-[Ilvira sobbing]
-Forever!

26:47.875 --> 26:48.958
[clanging tone]

26:50.083 --> 26:53.208
Oh! You still remember me!

26:53.291 --> 26:57.000
What do you want from me? Money?
I'll pay as much as you want.

26:57.083 --> 26:59.208
A license? Have a lifetime one!

26:59.291 --> 27:00.500
[king] Let me go.

27:00.583 --> 27:01.666
[Ilvira laughing]

27:01.750 --> 27:05.250
Oh, Your Majesty, no need to go that far.

27:05.333 --> 27:08.791
-Why would I need those trinkets?
-Then what do you need?

27:08.875 --> 27:12.750
Soon, your whole kingdom will be mine!

27:12.833 --> 27:16.791
-[dramatic orchestral music plays]
-No! No way! Never in my life!

27:16.875 --> 27:19.541
Wait, wait, Your Majesty. Calm down.

27:19.625 --> 27:23.125
I'd like you to try
my brand-new royal dessert.

27:23.708 --> 27:24.541
-I--
-[boing]

27:24.625 --> 27:28.958
-Mmm. Yummy! Delicious, isn't it?
-What are they made of?

27:29.041 --> 27:31.250
Some nasty stuff again?

27:31.333 --> 27:34.333
Oh, you can't have too many frogs
in your soup.

27:34.416 --> 27:37.083
I'm sure you're gonna
love them soon enough,

27:37.166 --> 27:39.083
and love me, too.

27:39.666 --> 27:40.958
No! I would--

27:41.041 --> 27:42.666
-[boing]
-[king choking]

27:42.750 --> 27:45.083
-[king] No!
-Appetite comes with eating.

27:45.166 --> 27:47.666
-[Ilvira laughing]
-[king] No! No, I don't…

-Looks quiet, too quiet.
-[Hansel sighing]

28:05.375 --> 28:07.125
[Gretel] I don't like it.

28:07.208 --> 28:08.958
Why are we hiding, though?

28:09.041 --> 28:10.791
There's no one around.

28:10.875 --> 28:12.791
[owl hooting]

28:13.750 --> 28:17.041
It's probably booby-trapped,
so watch your step.

28:17.125 --> 28:18.250
Let's go.

28:18.833 --> 28:22.000
-[suspenseful music plays]
-[Gretel] Huh! Ha!

28:23.041 --> 28:23.916
Hah!

28:30.541 --> 28:31.583
Huh! Hm…

28:31.666 --> 28:32.583
[squishing]

28:32.666 --> 28:35.125
Looks like you fell into the slugs' trap.

28:35.208 --> 28:36.041
Huh?

28:36.125 --> 28:37.875
[gasping and screaming]

28:39.000 --> 28:40.541
-[clanging]
-Huh! Hm…

28:42.041 --> 28:44.375
[suspenseful music continues]

28:44.458 --> 28:45.291
Hm.

28:45.375 --> 28:46.875
[splashing and crackling]

28:46.958 --> 28:49.500
[Hansel] Hey, sis, when this is all over,

28:49.583 --> 28:52.125
who do I talk to about a little, you know,

28:52.208 --> 28:54.000
-compensation?
-Hmm.

28:54.083 --> 28:57.708
[Hansel] Is there a form I need
to fill out or timecard to submit?

29:00.875 --> 29:02.000
[metallic click]

29:02.666 --> 29:05.125
Hey, why didn't they give me one?

29:05.208 --> 29:07.833
Quiet.
You be the lookout, I'll check here.

29:07.916 --> 29:09.916
-[Hansel sighing]
-Huh! Hm! Huh!

29:11.375 --> 29:13.333
[electrical buzzing]

29:16.541 --> 29:17.416
[shivering]

29:17.500 --> 29:19.166
Freezing cold.

29:20.583 --> 29:21.541
Ah!

29:24.333 --> 29:27.166
Ah! So, tell me, how's your life?

29:27.250 --> 29:30.166
Do you have tattoos? You go clubbing?

29:30.250 --> 29:31.958
We haven't spoken in years.

29:32.041 --> 29:34.666
Let's not break that fine tradition, okay?

29:37.875 --> 29:38.916
[shivering]

29:39.000 --> 29:40.166
What on earth?

29:40.250 --> 29:41.583
[scale plays]

29:41.666 --> 29:42.791
Ohh!

29:42.875 --> 29:45.458
Exactly. How did I miss this?

29:45.541 --> 29:47.541
It's a trick, cold fire.

29:47.625 --> 29:51.500
Okay, let's go. There's no sign
of the mystery ingredient,

29:51.583 --> 29:53.125
just another dead end.

29:53.708 --> 29:54.750
[Gretel] Hansel?

29:55.291 --> 29:56.666
Hansel, where are you?

29:56.750 --> 29:58.250
[suspenseful music plays]

29:58.333 --> 30:00.500
Come here. I just found something.

30:00.583 --> 30:02.791
[gasping] You're… burning!

30:02.875 --> 30:05.208
Ah! It's not real fire. It's cold.

30:05.791 --> 30:08.333
I use this gag on stage.
Fools 'em every time.

30:08.416 --> 30:10.625
Follow me. There's a secret passage.

30:13.125 --> 30:16.166
"I work alone. I don't need a partner."

30:16.750 --> 30:17.875
Quiet.

30:19.875 --> 30:22.375
Looks like we found
someone's secret stash.

30:22.458 --> 30:25.458
Enough goodies to send the kingdom
into sugar coma.

30:31.291 --> 30:32.416
-Hmm.
-Ah.

30:32.500 --> 30:33.916
[cupcakes humming]

30:34.000 --> 30:34.916
Bingo.

30:37.083 --> 30:38.500
I can't believe my eyes.

[dramatic clang]

30:59.750 --> 31:02.083
[cupcakes yelling gibberish]

31:02.166 --> 31:04.083
That must be
where they're hiding the king.

31:04.166 --> 31:07.958
So, what are we gonna do?
Let's go get help from the agency.

31:08.958 --> 31:11.041
Negatory. I got this.

31:11.125 --> 31:13.250
Watch me and try to keep up.

Uhh! Huh! Hmm.

31:26.416 --> 31:27.291
Ahh?

31:27.375 --> 31:30.875
What's so scary about them?
They're just cupcakes.

31:30.958 --> 31:31.791
Huh?

31:32.250 --> 31:36.083
They should be scared of us.
We're at the top of the food chain.

31:36.166 --> 31:37.833
Hey, cupcake!

31:37.916 --> 31:40.666
Who's your owner or… baker or whatever?

31:40.750 --> 31:43.083
Where are you keeping the king? Answer!

31:43.791 --> 31:44.958
[laughing]

31:45.041 --> 31:47.875
[speaking gibberish, screaming]

31:47.958 --> 31:49.666
Stop it right now.

31:49.750 --> 31:52.250
[Hansel] What did I tell you?
You are gonna get it!

31:52.333 --> 31:54.625
-[cupcakes screaming]
-Ah-ha! Gotcha!

32:02.916 --> 32:05.333
Distract them until I find the king.

32:05.416 --> 32:06.708
[dog growling]

32:07.291 --> 32:09.791
So maybe I'm not
the top of the food chain?

32:09.875 --> 32:12.791
-[dog growling and barking]
-Ahhh!

32:12.875 --> 32:15.833
-[cupcakes yelling gibberish]
-Huhh! Ahh! Gretel!

32:15.916 --> 32:17.708
Don't let them in here!

32:17.791 --> 32:20.250
-Wha-- Huh! Ahhh!
-[jaws chomping]

32:20.333 --> 32:24.291
[Gretel] No king in here,
but so many potions.

32:40.708 --> 32:43.291
Huh-ah! Uh! Oof!

This isn't just a regular kidnapping.

-What, I…
-[dramatic music plays]

35:22.166 --> 35:26.083
"I, I…" You've turned
into a child, that's what.

35:26.166 --> 35:29.541
I told you not to touch anything.
[laughing]

35:29.625 --> 35:31.458
Now, I'll have to work alone.

35:31.541 --> 35:35.291
But I'm a special agent,
and I can do this.

35:35.375 --> 35:37.875
And you only bring trouble anyway.

[music builds]

What?

35:42.375 --> 35:44.333
No… No!

35:44.416 --> 35:46.583
I don't want to be a child!

35:46.666 --> 35:51.833
Going to school again! Wahhh!

35:51.916 --> 35:54.791
I was a straight-A student for ten years!

35:54.875 --> 35:56.958
I won't go through that again!

35:57.041 --> 35:59.666
Oh, I really hated being a kid.

35:59.750 --> 36:03.416
Homework, vegetables, being grounded,

36:03.500 --> 36:05.291
feeling powerless.

36:05.375 --> 36:07.458
There must be a way to fix it.

36:07.541 --> 36:10.458
I told you not to throw
magic potions around.

36:10.541 --> 36:14.208
Oh, so it would be better
if that monster had eaten us?

36:14.291 --> 36:15.500
[dog barking]

36:16.041 --> 36:19.958
And you should have listened to me
and gone to get help anyway!

36:20.041 --> 36:23.666
But, no, you've grown up so presumptuous.

36:23.750 --> 36:25.250
-Self-sufficient!
-Ohh!

36:25.333 --> 36:30.125
I am the only one in history to get the

I get fooled like a newbie!

Hey, you! What have you done?
What's going on here?

36:53.541 --> 36:54.625
We should leave.

36:54.708 --> 36:56.625
[soldier] Hey, get back here!

36:58.291 --> 37:00.875
Get 'em! Men, this way!

[soldier] After them!

37:02.875 --> 37:04.708
[soldier] They'll get away!

37:06.916 --> 37:09.375
Phew! That was a close call.
[chuckling]

37:10.458 --> 37:11.375
What next?

37:11.958 --> 37:13.458
I'm thinking.

37:13.541 --> 37:14.750
Fungus Shrinkillus!

37:14.833 --> 37:17.666
Hey! I wasn't calling you names.

37:17.750 --> 37:20.875
Not you, the potion that transformed us.

37:20.958 --> 37:23.333
Fungus Shrinkillus by Baba Yaga.

37:23.416 --> 37:25.125
I saw it back on the shelf.

37:25.208 --> 37:27.708
Oh, so what do we do now?

37:27.791 --> 37:32.500
We have the evidence. Agent Stepdaughter
will find out who this mark belongs to,

37:32.583 --> 37:34.916
and then we'll nail the kidnapper.

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
Let's go back to the SMCA.

37:37.083 --> 37:39.250
Will she be able to break the spell?

37:39.333 --> 37:43.000
I hope so. We won't get the king back
as long as we're kids.

37:43.666 --> 37:45.041
[slide whistle]

37:45.666 --> 37:47.500
Leave it! Let's go.

Hey, it's just a puppy.
We can't just leave him completely alone.

37:52.291 --> 37:55.500
Okay, fine.
Maybe it can be of some use in the lab

-for some experiments.

I'll show you. You're gonna regret this.

38:36.708 --> 38:38.875

Calm down!

Okay.

We need to find another way into HQ.

Hansel and Gretel are the best.

I'm most certain
they've tracked the kidnapper

39:22.833 --> 39:25.041
and are bringing them here right now.

[Gretel] I can't believe
they're doing this to us.

40:21.333 --> 40:23.375
[Gretel] We are special agents.

40:23.458 --> 40:27.208
We're just children to them.
You wouldn't believe us, either.

You're right.

40:40.291 --> 40:43.666
Getting any help from
the SMCA apparently isn't an option,

40:43.750 --> 40:47.208
but we are not just some regular kids,
after all.

40:47.291 --> 40:49.333
We can deal with this on our own.

40:49.416 --> 40:51.916
Let's go to the Thick Forest.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.458
To the Thick Forest? Why?

40:54.541 --> 40:56.583
Even the wolves are afraid to go.

40:56.666 --> 40:59.125
That's where Baba Yaga's lair is.

40:59.208 --> 41:02.583
Yeah. She is exactly who we need to visit.

41:03.166 --> 41:06.750
Are you out of your mind?
Baba Yaga eats children.

41:06.833 --> 41:07.958
Allegedly.

41:08.041 --> 41:11.416
There's no evidence that proves it,
no witnesses either.

41:11.500 --> 41:14.041
Yeah, because she ate them all.

41:15.000 --> 41:18.333
Don't forget that I'm Special Agent Gretel

41:18.416 --> 41:20.958
from the Secret Magic Control Agency,

41:21.041 --> 41:24.875
and I can easily make
Baba Yaga take the spell off us.

-She's sure to know who makes the powder.
-Oh. So,

41:28.875 --> 41:31.875
-how are we gonna make it to her place?

Oh, stop it. Can't you even let me dream?

43:07.833 --> 43:08.875
Hey, you! Hut!

we're children, Hansel and Gretel.

[Gretel] Let us in.

43:35.375 --> 43:36.291
What's wrong?

Oh, well, you know, it's just that…

there's Baba Yaga!

43:42.000 --> 43:44.208
Agh! Let's go.

43:46.500 --> 43:47.333
Children?

43:47.833 --> 43:49.541
With a barking cookie dog?

43:49.625 --> 43:51.750
We're from
the Secret Magic Control Agency,

43:51.833 --> 43:53.500
and the dog is evidence.

43:53.583 --> 43:56.416
We are investigating
the abduction of the king.

43:57.000 --> 43:58.833
But where are your parents?

43:58.916 --> 44:01.791
We have no parents. We're orphans.

44:01.875 --> 44:03.000
[gasping]

44:03.708 --> 44:07.583
-Please come in, my dear children.
-[eerie music plays]

44:07.666 --> 44:11.875
-Told you. She rocks!
-Don't stay out in the cold, come in.

44:11.958 --> 44:17.375
I'll give you some food and warm beds
and will tell you everything.

44:28.458 --> 44:32.083
[Baba Yaga] I'm selling my potions
in seven kingdoms.

44:32.166 --> 44:35.250
No way I could remember all my customers.

44:35.333 --> 44:39.250
[Gretel] Will you be able to take
the spell off of us, Granny Yaga?

44:39.333 --> 44:42.000
[Gretel]
I remember the name of the potion.

44:42.083 --> 44:44.125
It was Fungus Shrinkillus.

44:44.208 --> 44:46.583
-We'll pay you back.
-[Baba Yaga humming]

44:46.666 --> 44:49.958
I'll prolong your license
for ten more years at once,

44:50.041 --> 44:52.958
as soon as I become the regular me again.

44:53.041 --> 44:55.666
I will, my darling. I will.

44:55.750 --> 44:59.958
I'll boil the potion by morning
and take the hex right off.

45:00.041 --> 45:02.916
But now you should go to sleep.

45:03.000 --> 45:06.458
Everything gets better
after a good night's sleep.

45:06.541 --> 45:07.916
[Gretel yawning]

45:08.000 --> 45:09.583
I could use some sleep.

45:11.041 --> 45:13.416
One more question, Granny Yaga.

45:13.500 --> 45:15.958
This potion, where does it come from?

45:16.041 --> 45:18.875
I thought you were the only one
who produced magic potions.

45:18.958 --> 45:22.125
Ah! There's a mighty lake witch.

45:22.208 --> 45:24.375
[Baba Yaga] She makes this vanilla.

45:24.458 --> 45:27.875
-[Baba Yaga] She lives by a huge volcano.
-[Gretel gasping]

45:30.375 --> 45:34.375
By the way,
your dog just reeks of vanilla.

45:34.958 --> 45:35.791
[gulping]

45:35.875 --> 45:38.500
That means it was
she who kidnapped our king?

45:38.583 --> 45:41.708
-[Gretel laughing nervously]
-Of course. Who else?

45:41.791 --> 45:44.500
Okay. Now, you need to go to bed

45:44.583 --> 45:47.583
if you want me to take
the spells off in the morning.

45:47.666 --> 45:50.666
[Baba Yaga] I still need
to cook the potion.

45:51.250 --> 45:53.416
Listen to what grown-ups are saying.

45:53.500 --> 45:54.666
To bed now.

45:54.750 --> 45:57.166
-Good night, Granny Baba Yaga.
-Wha--

45:57.708 --> 45:59.583
Night night, kids.

46:00.375 --> 46:02.083
Sleep tight.

46:03.541 --> 46:04.791
What an old crone!

46:05.500 --> 46:07.916
[Gretel yawning]
She does want to eat us!

46:08.000 --> 46:09.500
Uh, what do you mean?

46:09.583 --> 46:13.166
She laced the pastries
with a sleeping potion.

46:14.250 --> 46:16.250
"Told you, she rocks!"

46:16.333 --> 46:18.125
[groaning]

46:18.208 --> 46:23.208
-We shouldn't have come here at all.
-No, it was the right thing to do.

46:23.791 --> 46:25.875
[Gretel yawning]
You heard her.

46:25.958 --> 46:29.666
The king was kidnapped by the Lake Witch.

46:29.750 --> 46:32.375
[gasping]
Well, we need to run. Run now.

46:32.458 --> 46:34.583
[Hansel] Let's climb through the window!

46:34.666 --> 46:36.625

Guh!

46:40.375 --> 46:41.625

Don't fall asleep. What do we do?

46:45.083 --> 46:46.291
-[bell ringing]
-Ooh!

46:46.375 --> 46:49.041
-Ow.
-Go the kitchen, look through the herbs.

46:49.125 --> 46:52.083
[yawning]
The one we need is called "moon gem."

46:52.166 --> 46:55.666
This is the antidote.
If we don't get it, we're…

46:55.750 --> 46:56.750
we're…

46:56.833 --> 46:58.583

47:28.333 --> 47:30.750
[Hansel] Congratulations!

47:30.833 --> 47:34.041
-Ah! What? Where?
-[Hansel] You're our lucky winner.

47:34.125 --> 47:37.458
-You have won--
-Oh, my! Begone, wretched being!

47:37.541 --> 47:40.625
[Hansel] Oh… such a shame.

47:40.708 --> 47:43.875
You're the first winner
in a thousand years.

47:44.666 --> 47:45.916
Wait!

47:46.833 --> 47:49.208
But… what have I won?

47:49.291 --> 47:52.958
A trip to a far away tropical paradise!

47:53.041 --> 47:57.875
[Hansel] Sandy beaches, fruity cocktails,
soothing mud baths, facelifts.

47:57.958 --> 48:00.708
Ooh! Will there also be men?

48:00.791 --> 48:04.041
Huh-ho! Disco dancing every Friday.

48:04.125 --> 48:07.833
-But first you must pay a winner's tax.
-Tax?

48:07.916 --> 48:09.625
Yeah, just a tiny formality.

48:09.708 --> 48:12.458
What's one moon gem
in exchange for your happiness?

48:12.541 --> 48:16.000
Uh, hey. Well, yes, I have one right here.

-Um, here.
-Is this the moon gem?

48:26.875 --> 48:29.083
-Well, yes.
-Are you sure?

48:29.750 --> 48:34.000
[Hansel] All righty, then! This is
your trip ticket. See you in paradise!

48:34.625 --> 48:36.250
Hah-ha!

48:36.333 --> 48:37.375

Yeaghh!

-[dog barking]
-Shh!

48:58.333 --> 49:02.416
[Baba Yaga] Hey, shouldn't you be asleep?
Open the door! Do it!

49:03.750 --> 49:06.083
Oh, what do we do? She'll devour us.

49:06.166 --> 49:08.166
We need to run to the Lake Witch!

49:08.250 --> 49:11.791
How? The unicycle is gone,
and we're surrounded by swamps!

49:11.875 --> 49:13.708
Then we'll fly in the mortar!

49:13.791 --> 49:16.041
Right! The mortar in the attic!

49:16.625 --> 49:17.875
[gears turning]

49:17.958 --> 49:20.916
I guess we'll get to find out
if it can really fly.

Look!

-I know, right?

51:38.625 --> 51:40.375
You totally got her!

51:40.458 --> 51:44.833
You burned Baba Yaga's hut, and I thought
you grew up and became a total bore.

51:44.916 --> 51:46.166
But that just rocked!

51:46.250 --> 51:48.625
And I thought you had no brains left,

51:48.708 --> 51:53.291
but you worked it out so that we could
hijack the mortar and save ourselves.

What do you say?

51:58.833 --> 52:02.041
Maybe. Okay, now, pass me the broom.

52:02.125 --> 52:03.083
What broom?

52:03.166 --> 52:05.791
Baba Yaga's broom,
you ran to get it on the roof?

52:05.875 --> 52:09.333
Yeah, you told me to break it.
That's what I did.

52:09.416 --> 52:13.791
What? That's not what I said.
Why did you break it?

52:13.875 --> 52:15.791
All witches use brooms to fly.

If it wasn't for me,
she'd have already caught up with us.

That's exactly what I was going to do,
my sweethearts.

1:15:04.250 --> 1:15:08.125
His Majesty and I are flying

So you've worked out my plan.

1:15:15.291 --> 1:15:17.666
But it doesn't much matter anymore.

1:16:16.791 --> 1:16:18.416
This is all your fault.

1:16:18.500 --> 1:16:21.083
If you weren't such a liar and swindler,

1:16:21.166 --> 1:16:24.916
the king wouldn't have recognized you,
I would have saved him.

1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:27.583
You said it yourself. He's bewitched.

1:16:27.666 --> 1:16:30.125
You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me.

1:16:30.208 --> 1:16:34.250
Exactly! I've always
achieved everything on my own.

1:16:34.333 --> 1:16:37.083
I would have found the king, but no…

1:16:37.166 --> 1:16:40.166
you had to get involved
and ruin everything,

1:16:40.250 --> 1:16:42.833
so you could get that 80th-level license.

1:16:42.916 --> 1:16:45.666
Ugh! You can never have enough!

1:16:45.750 --> 1:16:50.166
You think I'm here because of the license?
That's just a piece of paper.

1:16:50.250 --> 1:16:53.500
I have plenty of fans
lining up to see me anyway.

1:16:53.583 --> 1:16:55.250
Don't lie to me.

You're selfish,
and you've been like this your whole life.

1:16:59.500 --> 1:17:01.291
You became a swindler

while our parents
were honest fighters of evil.

1:17:04.750 --> 1:17:08.625
You could have studied like I did and
gotten a scholarship from the king.

There was no scholarship!

Without our parents, we were penniless.
We had nothing.

1:17:23.083 --> 1:17:26.166
Do you think I didn't
want to become an agent…

1:17:26.250 --> 1:17:28.666
or that it was my dream to cheat people?

1:17:28.750 --> 1:17:32.250
I had to so you could fulfill your dream!

1:17:32.833 --> 1:17:36.250
No. I have achieved everything myself.

1:17:36.333 --> 1:17:39.500
Yes, you achieved everything yourself.

1:17:39.583 --> 1:17:41.416
I just helped you get started.

1:17:41.500 --> 1:17:44.000
