WEBVTT

00:13.246 --> 00:14.214
Come on.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.249
Come on, damn it!

00:16.316 --> 00:17.984
This will end up bad.

00:22.589 --> 00:23.890
Come on, damn it.

00:28.361 --> 00:30.296
I warned you, damn it!

00:34.501 --> 00:35.435
Come on.

00:37.704 --> 00:38.938
You won't get away with it.

00:39.005 --> 00:42.208
Shut up, slut!
I won't go back to jail!

01:29.189 --> 01:30.924
EPISODE: PRISCILA

01:36.496 --> 01:37.464
Tell me.

01:39.332 --> 01:40.300
Who are you?

01:44.237 --> 01:46.106
Why did you come here?

01:47.907 --> 01:49.642
You are the investigator,
aren't you?

01:51.411 --> 01:52.612
Why don't you figure it out?

02:12.132 --> 02:13.099
Good evening.

02:14.667 --> 02:15.602
Miss!

02:16.102 --> 02:20.140
We are looking for an agency,
"Perdidos". How is it?

02:20.206 --> 02:22.008
-"Ausentes".
-"Ausentes".

02:22.542 --> 02:25.311
This is the address,
but it's a candy store.

02:25.378 --> 02:26.579
-It's here.
-Miss!

02:26.646 --> 02:29.115
Help us, please.
My daughter has gone missing.

02:30.517 --> 02:32.919
No problem. Take a seat.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.787
-Excuse me.
-Go ahead.

02:36.256 --> 02:38.158
Tell me what happened.

02:38.525 --> 02:42.495
Your partner told us
you are the best in São Paulo.

02:43.396 --> 02:46.366
She said you would find
my granddaughter.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.601
My partner said that?

02:52.438 --> 02:54.207
When did she go missing?

02:54.274 --> 02:56.009
Yesterday, at 6 p.m.

02:56.075 --> 02:58.211
She went to school
and disappeared.

02:58.278 --> 03:01.648
Her friends haven't see her.
Her cellphone is off.

03:01.714 --> 03:03.483
And she always answers it.

03:05.251 --> 03:06.619
Do you get along?

03:06.686 --> 03:07.654
What?

03:08.087 --> 03:09.455
What are you suggesting?

03:09.522 --> 03:12.725
I'm just seeing it
from different angles.

03:13.059 --> 03:15.495
My granddaughter, Priscila,
is 16 years old.

03:15.562 --> 03:17.030
Girls are difficult.

03:17.096 --> 03:20.200
They argue, but it's normal.

03:20.266 --> 03:21.234
And...

03:21.801 --> 03:24.170
You and your daughter
live with your father?

03:24.237 --> 03:26.940
Yes. I promised to my late wife

03:28.007 --> 03:29.409
that I was going
to look after them.

03:29.709 --> 03:30.877
What about the girl's father?

03:31.644 --> 03:33.413
She doesn't have a father.
He died.

03:36.683 --> 03:37.884
Does Priscila have a boyfriend?

03:39.419 --> 03:40.386
No.

03:41.354 --> 03:45.291
Man, let's stop talking.
I'll pay you anything.

03:45.358 --> 03:47.260
I want you to find
my granddaughter!

03:47.860 --> 03:51.998
Relax, I'll do my best
to find your grandchild.

03:53.166 --> 03:56.102
I need to check some details
with my partner.

03:57.804 --> 03:59.105
Give me a minute.

04:03.276 --> 04:05.111
-Why have you come back?
-You can't say no.

04:05.178 --> 04:06.879
You have to accept this case.

04:06.946 --> 04:09.182
They said they would pay
anything.

04:09.582 --> 04:13.052
If you leave me out of it,
they will leave.

04:13.920 --> 04:17.657
You wouldn't let
a 16-year-old go missing.

04:17.724 --> 04:19.425
I won't waste my time with you.

04:20.393 --> 04:21.361
Listen.

04:21.694 --> 04:23.496
Do you want
to play detectives? Fine.

04:23.563 --> 04:25.164
Don't say I didn't warn you.

04:27.800 --> 04:28.735
Wake up, Waldir!

04:32.238 --> 04:34.307
Priscila, 16 years old.

04:35.375 --> 04:38.311
She went to school yesterday
and didn't come back.

04:39.279 --> 04:42.248
Her mother called
her friends and family.

04:42.315 --> 04:44.217
Nobody knows anything.
She isn't with anyone.

04:45.018 --> 04:48.254
Morgue, hospitals,
police stations, everything.

04:49.155 --> 04:50.356
Dirty work at this time?

04:51.457 --> 04:52.425
Any problem?

04:52.892 --> 04:53.860
No.

04:56.629 --> 04:57.597
None.

04:58.798 --> 05:02.101
Tai, check her social networks
and her friends ones too.

05:02.168 --> 05:03.569
Boyfriend, groups.

05:03.636 --> 05:06.039
Anything relevant.

05:06.105 --> 05:07.774
They said she didn't have
a boyfriend.

05:08.975 --> 05:10.476
People lie.

05:18.584 --> 05:20.653
They are Priscila's friends.

05:22.255 --> 05:24.657
We've told Celina
everything we know.

05:25.391 --> 05:27.660
Pri has been acting
weird lately.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.562
She's been avoiding us.

05:29.962 --> 05:31.898
I wanted to make a prank to her.

05:31.964 --> 05:34.534
I grabbed her cellphone,
and she got mad

05:34.600 --> 05:36.502
as if I had done
something terrible.

05:38.571 --> 05:40.873
Why did you do that?

05:41.474 --> 05:43.142
She was acting mysterious.

05:43.209 --> 05:45.645
She didn't want to talk about
the guy she was dating.

05:46.612 --> 05:48.514
She was dating a guy?

05:49.282 --> 05:50.983
She talked to some boy.

05:51.718 --> 05:52.685
Who?

05:53.052 --> 05:54.020
I don't know.

06:27.286 --> 06:29.155
At your age, I didn't smoke
in the bathroom.

06:30.757 --> 06:33.025
Shut up, if you will send me
to the principal's office.

06:33.359 --> 06:35.895
I'm here to help your friend.

06:48.107 --> 06:49.142
What's your name?

06:52.245 --> 06:53.212
Nathalia.

06:53.880 --> 06:58.518
Nathalia, don't take long
to tell me what you know

06:59.318 --> 07:01.521
because things can get
more dangerous for her, okay?

07:10.263 --> 07:12.098
Those brats
are not Pri's friends.

07:12.799 --> 07:14.634
They wouldn't understand
what she's going through.

07:14.700 --> 07:17.069
What's she going through?
Tell me.

07:18.171 --> 07:19.672
I'm here to help Priscila.

07:24.477 --> 07:26.012
Priscila was talking
to her father.

07:26.078 --> 07:28.047
Her father? Isn't he dead?

07:28.114 --> 07:29.649
You see, nobody listens to her.

07:30.049 --> 07:31.350
That's what her grandpa says.

07:31.818 --> 07:34.387
She found out he's alive
and wrote to him.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.956
He didn't answer for months.
One day she received a letter.

07:37.023 --> 07:39.725
-Who writes letters nowadays?
-Pri really liked it.

07:39.792 --> 07:41.494
Her mother always
checks on her cellphone.

07:41.561 --> 07:42.895
She wouldn't check on a letter.

07:42.962 --> 07:45.231
-Priscila is with her dad?
-No. Impossible.

07:45.698 --> 07:47.667
-Her dad is in jail.
-He is?

07:47.733 --> 07:50.336
She's tried to visit him,
but she's a minor.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.488
Are you sure the kid said

08:08.554 --> 08:10.556
that Flávio is Priscila's dad?

08:10.623 --> 08:12.058
How do you know his name?

08:13.159 --> 08:16.229
One of the girls said
the guy she was talking to

08:16.295 --> 08:17.763
was called Flávio.

08:18.297 --> 08:20.733
They thought he was
her boyfriend, not her dad.

08:22.969 --> 08:24.704
What does Geraldo do?

08:25.671 --> 08:28.741
He has five gas stations
in São Miguel.

08:29.175 --> 08:30.142
I see.

08:33.779 --> 08:34.914
So it was him.

08:35.214 --> 08:37.316
It was that bastard.

08:37.850 --> 08:40.653
He's trying to destroy
our family again.

08:41.220 --> 08:42.855
We don't know if it was him.

08:42.922 --> 08:46.092
I know it. I feel it here,
in my guts.

08:46.158 --> 08:48.427
That bastard took my grandchild.

08:48.828 --> 08:51.497
How did she find out
he was alive?

08:53.699 --> 08:54.667
Celina?

08:56.469 --> 08:58.304
Did you tell her?

09:00.339 --> 09:01.841
Yes, we were arguing.

09:03.142 --> 09:05.111
She accused me
of being a bad mother,

09:05.645 --> 09:07.246
she felt sorry
for him being dead,

09:07.313 --> 09:08.381
and I exploded.

09:08.714 --> 09:12.418
I said that he was so good
that he'd rot in jail.

09:17.456 --> 09:20.893
Sad drawings for a 16-year-old.

09:22.929 --> 09:26.499
We keep underestimating
teenagers' feelings.

10:11.944 --> 10:14.880
I'm so happy
for having the opportunity

10:15.615 --> 10:18.417
to talk to the daughter
I didn't know existed.

10:18.851 --> 10:21.087
Wait, he didn't know
he was her father?

10:21.954 --> 10:23.522
When I found out I was pregnant,

10:24.957 --> 10:26.325
he was in jail,

10:26.392 --> 10:27.893
and my father
wouldn't let me tell him.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.395
Of course not, Celina.

10:31.063 --> 10:33.065
Kid, you are a special girl.

10:33.733 --> 10:35.935
Your mom does not get you.

10:36.669 --> 10:38.237
I'm so glad I can help you.

10:38.871 --> 10:40.439
Of course I don't get her.

10:40.506 --> 10:42.008
She won't talk to me!

10:42.541 --> 10:44.176
But she talks to her dad.

10:48.314 --> 10:51.083
I really want to see you.
Your dad, Flávio.

10:53.185 --> 10:54.353
Dad, this is your fault.

10:54.420 --> 10:57.623
You hate Flávio
and want to control everything.

10:57.690 --> 10:59.191
Why didn't we tell her
the truth?

10:59.258 --> 11:01.827
Because you were
just 20 years old, Celina.

11:01.894 --> 11:03.763
And that bastard too!

11:04.163 --> 11:06.599
He's in jail for selling drugs

11:06.866 --> 11:08.567
at a party full of teenagers.

11:08.634 --> 11:11.804
When you asked me
to work with you in Defense,

11:13.639 --> 11:14.607
what did I say?

11:17.877 --> 11:18.844
What did I say?

11:19.278 --> 11:22.048
Why did you put me
in communications?

11:22.114 --> 11:24.450
Me, your daughter, why?
To cover up your crimes?

11:24.517 --> 11:27.119
Honey, calm down.

11:28.421 --> 11:30.623
-Melina...
-Don't lie to me.

11:31.824 --> 11:34.326
Who do you sell
those unregistered guns to?

11:34.393 --> 11:36.195
It's much more complicated
than it seems.

11:39.031 --> 11:39.999
You are right.

11:43.002 --> 11:45.204
I should have told you
the truth.

11:45.271 --> 11:47.540
But I can't reveal
what's going on yet.

11:47.606 --> 11:49.675
I can't work with you
here, then.

11:54.980 --> 11:56.282
You are just like your mother.

11:56.849 --> 11:57.817
Yes.

11:58.517 --> 12:00.820
I'm just like my mother.

12:04.290 --> 12:06.125
Wait, honey.

12:07.093 --> 12:08.060
What do you want?

12:10.830 --> 12:11.897
You have to understand

12:11.964 --> 12:14.934
everything that happens in here
is not up to me.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.136
There's something big going on.

12:18.938 --> 12:20.840
First, the situation
will get worse,

12:22.141 --> 12:23.676
but then it will be fine.

12:33.252 --> 12:34.653
Things will change.

12:36.055 --> 12:37.022
They will.

12:39.792 --> 12:41.260
I'm with you, dad.

12:42.995 --> 12:45.097
I'm with you. Wherever you are.

12:45.164 --> 12:47.399
Why didn't we tell him
the truth?

12:47.466 --> 12:48.901
He was a first offender.

12:48.968 --> 12:50.703
You used your contacts
to ruin him.

12:50.770 --> 12:54.206
I didn't want that bum
complicating your lives.

12:54.840 --> 12:55.808
Or mine!

13:01.781 --> 13:02.748
Excuse me.

13:04.617 --> 13:07.219
-Tell me, Waldir.
-I'm in Brás morgue.

13:07.553 --> 13:10.890
There's a black girl,
16 years old.

13:11.624 --> 13:14.260
She doesn't have an ID,
but the description matches.

13:14.994 --> 13:15.961
Description?

13:16.562 --> 13:19.465
Can you look at her face
to check if it's her?

13:20.499 --> 13:21.467
No.

13:22.201 --> 13:24.270
Her face is disfigured.

13:26.472 --> 13:27.439
Wait.

13:31.377 --> 13:33.913
The report says
she was beaten and strangulated.

13:34.346 --> 13:35.314
Just that.

13:36.649 --> 13:39.218
What do we do now?

13:42.555 --> 13:44.957
Does she have any birth marks?

13:45.024 --> 13:47.626
What do you mean?
What's going on, Raul?

13:47.693 --> 13:49.061
I need that information.

13:49.795 --> 13:51.764
She has a tattoo.

13:52.298 --> 13:53.866
Like mine, on her ankle.

13:55.534 --> 13:56.602
A red rose.

13:57.503 --> 14:00.940
A tattoo of a red rose
on her ankle.

14:02.274 --> 14:03.242
Ankle?

14:13.252 --> 14:14.220
Nothing.

14:15.054 --> 14:16.155
Everything is fine.

14:16.222 --> 14:18.023
Thank God!

14:22.561 --> 14:25.097
POLICE STATION

14:31.604 --> 14:33.239
You must be kidding me.

14:33.305 --> 14:35.708
Who am I
to ask you for a favor, right?

14:36.442 --> 14:38.577
We're friends
not only in good times.

14:39.011 --> 14:40.279
Where are the good times?

14:46.418 --> 14:48.187
Hello, Silvio, how are you?

14:48.721 --> 14:51.891
Fine. I need a visitor's pass

14:51.957 --> 14:53.792
for a prisoner called
Flávio Peixoto.

14:53.859 --> 14:54.994
For today.

14:58.197 --> 14:59.164
Really?

14:59.932 --> 15:00.966
Until when?

15:02.434 --> 15:04.303
Fine, Silvio. Thanks.

15:05.671 --> 15:07.673
He was released
on Mother's Day reprieve.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.842
-Damn! Really?
-Yes.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.110
I'll send you his picture

15:11.176 --> 15:13.012
and the address
of his mom, Ivete.

15:13.345 --> 15:14.947
That's all I have in his file.

15:15.481 --> 15:17.016
-Go.
-Thanks, Dama.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.062
This place is very sad.

15:30.629 --> 15:31.597
It is.

15:33.399 --> 15:36.468
If his mom told us the truth,
he has to be here.

15:37.670 --> 15:38.637
Pay attention.

15:40.139 --> 15:41.106
Look.

15:45.544 --> 15:46.512
There.

15:46.779 --> 15:47.913
-It's him.
-Hello.

15:47.980 --> 15:49.381
-Yeah, it's him.
-Hey.

15:49.915 --> 15:50.883
Hey, wait.

15:51.216 --> 15:52.184
Stop!

15:53.218 --> 15:54.186
Damn it.

15:56.255 --> 15:58.123
Hey! Hey!

15:58.190 --> 15:59.325
Wait. Damn!

15:59.792 --> 16:00.826
Stop.

16:01.126 --> 16:02.094
Stop!

16:10.602 --> 16:11.570
Where is she?

16:11.870 --> 16:13.305
Where's Priscila?

16:18.110 --> 16:20.112
If Celina
weren't Geraldo's daughter,

16:20.946 --> 16:22.815
I wouldn't have been in jail
for so long.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.551
He asked the judge
to leave me in there.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.152
Why did you run?

16:28.754 --> 16:31.123
Man, I was reprieved,
walking through "Crackland".

16:31.190 --> 16:32.191
What do you think?

16:32.658 --> 16:33.826
Why are you here?

16:35.094 --> 16:36.295
I know some guys

16:36.362 --> 16:39.131
that have a rough time
on Mother's Day.

16:39.798 --> 16:40.933
I came here to help them.

16:42.368 --> 16:44.136
I didn't know a thing
about this girl.

16:44.203 --> 16:46.005
Celina didn't tell me
she was pregnant.

16:46.338 --> 16:48.574
Fifteen years later,
the girl shows up.

16:48.640 --> 16:51.343
What does she want?
What can I offer her?

16:51.677 --> 16:53.512
We found some letters.

16:55.714 --> 16:59.151
All of them were signed by you.

17:02.354 --> 17:04.156
-That's not my handwriting.
-What?

17:04.690 --> 17:06.291
-It's not my handwriting.
-It's not?

17:06.358 --> 17:08.694
I swear, it's not mine.
I didn't write these letters.

17:11.063 --> 17:12.031
Wait.

17:17.202 --> 17:18.337
Write something here.

17:32.785 --> 17:35.554
GERALDO IS AN IDIOT
I LOVED CELINA

17:35.621 --> 17:36.655
What the hell?

17:38.991 --> 17:41.093
Some cellmate of yours
took the letters

17:41.160 --> 17:42.528
and pretended to be you.

17:44.596 --> 17:46.465
Do you know who?

17:46.532 --> 17:49.568
I spent 15 years in jail.
It could be anyone.

17:50.536 --> 17:53.639
Damasceno sent me
the file on his cellmates.

17:53.705 --> 17:55.741
-They are 17.
-I know. And?

17:55.808 --> 17:58.210
Only one was released
on Mother's Day.

17:59.578 --> 18:00.612
Reginaldo Mendes.

18:03.248 --> 18:05.784
He was arrested ten times
for sexual offenses.

18:06.185 --> 18:07.152
He's a bastard.

18:07.820 --> 18:08.754
Damn it.

18:09.588 --> 18:12.558
Find anything about him
and send it to me.

18:12.624 --> 18:14.460
-About Flávio too.
-Done.

18:15.360 --> 18:16.829
You didn't believe Flávio?

18:32.478 --> 18:35.180
I knew you wouldn't leave soon.

18:39.351 --> 18:41.186
Could you help me?

18:41.887 --> 18:43.722
Only if I don't have
to leave the computer.

18:43.789 --> 18:44.756
You don't.

18:45.891 --> 18:46.859
What do you need?

18:47.926 --> 18:49.194
To figure something out.

18:51.396 --> 18:53.432
-It's like a code.
-I love codes.

18:53.999 --> 18:54.967
Show it to me.

18:57.035 --> 18:59.171
TOURISTIC BRAZIL
GUIOMAR. CO1308

18:59.238 --> 19:01.306
-This?
-I know it looks dumb.

19:01.773 --> 19:03.475
But it's important for me.

19:04.309 --> 19:06.478
Raul, isn't this girl
too young for you?

19:07.446 --> 19:08.514
What?

19:09.681 --> 19:10.949
No. Not at all.

19:13.152 --> 19:16.188
What is she doing here?
She isn't a journalist.

19:17.322 --> 19:20.359
She's not taking notes.
She isn't asking any questions.

19:21.093 --> 19:23.395
Edith, you have the soul
of an investigator.

19:28.033 --> 19:31.370
She lives in a kitchenette
without furniture.

19:32.204 --> 19:34.573
She has no family or friends
in São Paulo.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.775
Her ID is fake.

19:37.376 --> 19:39.077
What is she doing here?

20:32.664 --> 20:33.632
Raul.

20:34.266 --> 20:35.234
Check this out.

20:35.667 --> 20:37.936
Flávio and Reginaldo
are exemplary prisoners.

20:38.003 --> 20:40.105
Flávio was never in a fight
or used drugs.

20:40.172 --> 20:41.473
And he's studying.

20:41.540 --> 20:43.375
Reginaldo was converted
in prison

20:43.442 --> 20:45.143
and has a support group
for prisoners.

20:45.210 --> 20:46.945
He had an address
that no longer exists.

20:47.879 --> 20:49.147
Why am I not surprised?

20:49.715 --> 20:53.552
He goes to church now?
Which church?

20:53.619 --> 20:55.787
It is a new denomination,
created inside.

20:55.854 --> 20:58.023
Sacred Church
of Divine Purification.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.524
I know there are some
around here,

20:59.591 --> 21:00.726
but I don't know where.

21:00.792 --> 21:01.960
Find that out.

21:02.027 --> 21:03.528
If it were digital,
I would know by now.

21:03.595 --> 21:06.298
But it's just for ex-cons.

21:06.898 --> 21:09.334
-If you give me more time...
-We don't have time, Tai.

21:09.768 --> 21:10.736
Sure.

21:12.871 --> 21:14.940
-Wait, what time is it?
-I don't know.

21:15.307 --> 21:16.275
It's eight o'clock.

21:18.910 --> 21:19.878
What's going on?

21:23.915 --> 21:24.883
Damn it!

21:38.997 --> 21:40.065
I sometimes think

21:40.132 --> 21:41.700
about how she would look like
at this age.

21:43.635 --> 21:46.338
She disappeared here,
in São Paulo.

21:47.639 --> 21:48.907
She was looking for her father.

21:49.207 --> 21:51.343
How can you stand
working with this?

21:55.881 --> 21:56.848
Have you signed them?

22:17.035 --> 22:19.137
Raul, I'm trying to move on.

22:21.406 --> 22:23.075
It's been over ten years.

22:24.109 --> 22:26.778
Nobody suffered more than me.

22:29.281 --> 22:30.482
I still suffer.

22:31.817 --> 22:33.552
But a time comes when...

22:33.618 --> 22:35.554
I know she's still out there.

22:36.955 --> 22:37.923
I know it.

22:40.659 --> 22:42.928
I can't forget her.

22:45.897 --> 22:46.865
I can't.

22:57.809 --> 22:59.344
ANGELO SEMI AVENUE
DEI, 213

23:03.815 --> 23:05.283
You figured it out?

23:06.551 --> 23:08.220
It was easier
than what I thought.

23:08.887 --> 23:11.089
I thought, what could this be?

23:11.590 --> 23:13.325
CO 13.08?

23:13.959 --> 23:15.494
Corinthians 13, verse eight.

23:15.827 --> 23:17.963
"For we cannot do anything
against the truth,

23:18.029 --> 23:19.097
but only for the truth."

23:19.598 --> 23:20.665
Let me hear you say "Amen".

23:20.732 --> 23:23.368
It's fine, Tai.
But what does it mean?

23:23.435 --> 23:25.771
It's an epigraph
of the St. Clare's Convent.

23:25.837 --> 23:28.006
There are only three
in São Paulo.

23:28.073 --> 23:32.210
But I found out
there's only one Sister Guiomar.

23:33.011 --> 23:36.014
Tai, you are unique.

23:36.381 --> 23:37.983
The best!

23:38.884 --> 23:41.219
-Thanks!
-Bye. Take care.

23:42.554 --> 23:43.522
Dad!

23:49.394 --> 23:50.362
Dad?

23:52.564 --> 23:53.532
Dad?

24:27.165 --> 24:28.133
Melina!

24:29.668 --> 24:32.337
You have the same face
as you did when you were a kid.

24:33.472 --> 24:34.439
Guiomar.

24:35.974 --> 24:37.809
Your father came here once.

24:37.876 --> 24:40.479
He asked me to welcome you
in a good way.

24:41.847 --> 24:43.014
If you ever came.

24:43.748 --> 24:45.517
Do you know anything
about my father?

24:46.117 --> 24:48.353
You have me and the Lord.

24:48.420 --> 24:51.056
Have faith, and you will never
be alone.

24:53.925 --> 24:55.927
How long have you known
my father?

24:55.994 --> 24:57.429
For over 40 years.

24:57.863 --> 25:00.131
We belonged to a generation
that needed to trust

25:00.198 --> 25:01.466
in their partners.

25:02.100 --> 25:03.101
There wasn't a way out.

25:03.969 --> 25:05.770
My father left me a postcard.

25:08.073 --> 25:09.741
He wanted me to find you.

25:10.208 --> 25:11.443
Do you know where he is?

25:14.479 --> 25:15.447
I'm sorry.

25:16.448 --> 25:17.749
I don't know.

25:18.183 --> 25:21.019
I'm here if you need me.
Do you have a place to stay?

25:22.754 --> 25:24.189
Yes.

25:41.473 --> 25:43.808
I can sell it to you for 40.

25:53.218 --> 25:55.754
Hello, Tiribu. How's the accent?

25:56.288 --> 25:57.255
Perfect.

26:03.395 --> 26:04.362
It looks nice.

26:04.629 --> 26:07.332
When you left Pinheiros' prison,

26:07.399 --> 26:10.769
you went to a sect for ex-cons,

26:10.835 --> 26:12.437
-right?
-I've been saved, bro.

26:13.305 --> 26:15.373
Hey, cutie,
do you want to pick one?

26:15.907 --> 26:16.875
Yes, sure.

26:17.776 --> 26:18.743
What about this one?

26:19.411 --> 26:20.378
Wow!

26:21.580 --> 26:22.881
-It's pretty.
-How much?

26:23.348 --> 26:25.116
-For you, 20.
-Twenty?

26:26.117 --> 26:28.386
This sect you went to...

26:29.588 --> 26:31.423
Who was the pastor?
What was his name?

26:31.856 --> 26:34.593
Pastor Jair is really good.

26:34.659 --> 26:36.194
He helped many brothers
get well.

26:36.695 --> 26:39.664
Do you know the address
of this sect?

26:42.067 --> 26:43.935
The shameless sinner,

26:44.803 --> 26:45.770
do you know him?

26:46.771 --> 26:50.008
The one who sins
and blames the Lord.

26:50.909 --> 26:54.713
"No, Pastor!
When I cheated on my wife,

26:54.779 --> 26:58.516
when I killed,
God wasn't there!"

26:58.583 --> 26:59.718
That's a lie!

27:00.452 --> 27:02.454
God doesn't leave us!

27:02.787 --> 27:04.255
Glory to God!

27:05.490 --> 27:07.692
Take care, boy.

27:07.759 --> 27:08.727
May the peace be with you.

27:10.996 --> 27:14.199
My agent friends,
do you want the blessing too?

27:14.633 --> 27:15.634
We do not.

27:16.401 --> 27:18.970
You look like agents.

27:19.037 --> 27:22.307
The House of the Lord
is open for everybody,

27:22.374 --> 27:24.275
-no judgment at all.
-Thanks, Pastor.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.345
We just want information,

27:27.412 --> 27:29.748
Do you know Reginaldo Mendes?

27:30.949 --> 27:33.184
-Reginaldo Mendes?
-Cabello.

27:33.718 --> 27:36.721
Cabello? Sure, I know him.

27:37.288 --> 27:40.291
Today, Cabello is
a worker for the Lord.

27:40.358 --> 27:42.594
He has done an amazing job

27:42.661 --> 27:44.863
with the brothers
that are in jail with him.

27:45.430 --> 27:46.398
Fine.

27:47.265 --> 27:51.369
Pastor, there's a 16-year-old
that's in danger.

27:52.404 --> 27:57.642
I know Reginaldo had
some problems in the past.

27:57.709 --> 28:00.779
Yes, but he's in jail now,
you should know that.

28:00.845 --> 28:02.881
He was reprieved
on Mother's Day.

28:03.682 --> 28:04.649
Really?

28:05.183 --> 28:06.251
Yes.

28:06.317 --> 28:08.987
If he shows up here,
I'll reach you.

28:09.454 --> 28:12.257
It's really important for you
to know

28:12.323 --> 28:15.994
that they found peace here
for the mistakes they made.

28:18.863 --> 28:21.566
-Sure. Thanks, Pastor.
-You are welcome.

28:21.633 --> 28:23.935
God bless you.

28:24.235 --> 28:25.203
Excuse me.

28:28.206 --> 28:29.174
I like him.

28:30.275 --> 28:32.310
You know where to come
when you are free.

28:33.211 --> 28:34.312
Better salary, for sure.

28:42.587 --> 28:43.555
What?

28:47.425 --> 28:49.594
Was I the only one
who disliked the Pastor?

28:50.695 --> 28:54.299
Maybe because he's a pastor
from the suburbs, and you are...

28:54.365 --> 28:55.333
What?

28:55.934 --> 28:57.669
I think he means
you are a spoiled girl.

28:57.736 --> 28:58.703
Cut that off.

28:59.170 --> 29:01.973
If you are more than that,
feel free to talk.

29:02.040 --> 29:04.342
I won't listen to this nonsense.

29:05.376 --> 29:08.913
I play along with him,
but he's done.

29:09.948 --> 29:11.282
-Yes.
-Come.

29:12.851 --> 29:16.087
Eat it at your place,
it will get cold now.

29:17.422 --> 29:18.623
-Hello.
-Hello.

29:18.690 --> 29:19.891
-Everything okay?
-Yes.

29:20.625 --> 29:23.094
-A crazy meat, please.
-Yes.

29:23.161 --> 29:24.129
Already?

29:24.763 --> 29:26.531
-Seven bucks, right?
-Yes.

29:26.598 --> 29:28.767
-With a soda, eight.
-Sure, take the money.

29:30.201 --> 29:31.536
One question.

29:32.270 --> 29:33.371
Yeah.

29:33.438 --> 29:36.508
People from the church
eat here, right?

29:36.574 --> 29:38.610
A man has got to eat.

29:39.778 --> 29:42.847
Do you know this man?

29:44.983 --> 29:46.117
Maybe, but...

29:47.986 --> 29:50.722
I don't remember
anybody's features.

29:52.824 --> 29:55.360
Do you have any granddaughter?
Any daughters?

29:56.895 --> 29:59.798
Yes, a daughter
and three grandchildren.

30:00.098 --> 30:01.833
Do you know what this man did?

30:02.500 --> 30:04.068
Everybody here
went to jail sometime.

30:05.003 --> 30:06.337
But he's a good man.

30:08.306 --> 30:10.041
You know him, then?

31:59.984 --> 32:01.252
Let's go check inside.

32:04.088 --> 32:05.290
We are breaking in?

32:06.858 --> 32:08.393
Damasceno will eat you alive.

32:09.694 --> 32:11.296
We are already here, right?

34:08.479 --> 34:11.549
Leave him!

34:12.950 --> 34:14.619
Raul?

34:17.822 --> 34:19.524
Shut up!

34:23.094 --> 34:26.130
I wanted to ask you
more questions about Reginaldo.

34:26.197 --> 34:28.299
-Let's go inside.
-I don't want to bother you.

34:28.366 --> 34:32.070
-Have some water or juice.
-It's not necessary.

34:32.136 --> 34:33.738
It's not a problem. Come.

34:46.284 --> 34:47.251
It's here, right?

34:48.920 --> 34:51.622
The Lord is my shepherd,
I lack nothing.

35:00.832 --> 35:01.799
Come.

35:56.454 --> 35:58.222
How long have you been
doing this? Damn it!

35:58.289 --> 36:01.259
God is with us.
He gives us strength...

36:01.325 --> 36:04.228
Talk, bastard. How long have
you been kidnapping children?

36:04.295 --> 36:05.463
How long?

36:05.530 --> 36:07.298
I will fear no evil.

36:14.872 --> 36:17.041
Pray, bastard, pray!

36:19.477 --> 36:20.678
Kneeled before...

36:30.354 --> 36:31.422
Was it you?

36:31.489 --> 36:34.158
Did you reply to the letters
she sent to her dad?

36:34.225 --> 36:35.593
I just wanted to help her.

36:36.661 --> 36:38.563
One, two, three.

36:38.629 --> 36:41.866
God asked me to.
I did what He wanted.

36:41.933 --> 36:43.100
Did you rape her?

36:43.167 --> 36:44.302
Talk, bastard!

36:44.702 --> 36:45.770
Stop.

36:45.836 --> 36:47.305
Now, she's with Him.

36:47.371 --> 36:48.906
Stop!

36:49.974 --> 36:51.042
Raul?

36:51.108 --> 36:52.176
-What?
-Stop.

36:54.512 --> 36:55.479
Stop!

36:57.415 --> 36:58.916
Stop, brother!

36:58.983 --> 37:01.419
She's with Him.
She's with the Lord.

37:02.687 --> 37:05.089
-Bastard, did you kill her?
-She's with Him.

37:05.156 --> 37:08.292
She's in the house of the Lord.
She's with Him.

37:08.693 --> 37:11.696
Have some coffee.

37:13.030 --> 37:15.299
-Thanks.
-Excuse me.

37:15.366 --> 37:16.934
I'll go get something.

37:56.374 --> 37:57.341
Priscila?

37:59.410 --> 38:00.378
Relax.

38:07.351 --> 38:08.286
Damn it.

38:08.653 --> 38:09.620
You found her?

38:12.290 --> 38:13.257
Tell me.

38:14.125 --> 38:15.192
Let's go for a walk.

38:30.241 --> 38:31.509
Turn here.

38:47.058 --> 38:48.626
-Let's go, damn it.
-This will end up bad.

38:49.860 --> 38:51.262
This will go wrong.

38:56.067 --> 38:57.101
Come on, damn it!

39:00.604 --> 39:02.740
-Speed up, damn it!
-Relax.

39:03.307 --> 39:05.009
I warned you, damn it!

39:06.110 --> 39:07.078
Go!

39:14.285 --> 39:15.419
Come on, slut!

39:18.856 --> 39:20.925
You won't get away with it.
You won't.

39:20.991 --> 39:24.495
Shut up, slut.
I won't go back to prison.

39:46.951 --> 39:47.918
Are you okay?

39:51.689 --> 39:53.157
Come. Where's the kid?

39:53.224 --> 39:55.459
Where's the girl?

39:55.793 --> 39:58.396
Tell me, where is she?

40:03.534 --> 40:05.603
Relax, it's over.

40:06.737 --> 40:08.072
We are here to help you.

40:08.773 --> 40:09.740
It's over.

40:10.040 --> 40:11.008
Trust me.

40:17.381 --> 40:19.450
She's here, she's fine!

40:20.050 --> 40:21.152
Everything is fine.

40:21.919 --> 40:22.887
Come.

40:39.904 --> 40:41.338
You almost got killed.

40:42.072 --> 40:43.307
What were you doing there?

40:44.442 --> 40:45.409
Honey?

40:49.680 --> 40:50.648
God!

40:52.249 --> 40:53.217
Are you okay?

40:54.885 --> 40:56.720
I'm sorry, mom.

40:58.088 --> 40:59.056
I'm sorry.

41:06.497 --> 41:07.631
Thank God.

41:44.969 --> 41:46.737
I thought I had lost you.

41:56.080 --> 41:57.581
I thought I had lost you.

42:19.036 --> 42:20.004
Waldir?

42:53.871 --> 42:57.241
When I see a sad image
like that one,

42:57.641 --> 43:00.344
I think we need to see

43:00.411 --> 43:03.113
the purpose
behind every sacrifice.

43:08.185 --> 43:09.520
Why did you call me, Guiomar?

43:11.055 --> 43:13.424
Because you were right.

43:15.292 --> 43:16.594
I'm sorry, kid.

43:19.730 --> 43:20.698
Look.

43:23.133 --> 43:26.604
I didn't know
whether to give you this statue

43:27.438 --> 43:29.607
or just wait for you to forget.

43:31.742 --> 43:33.210
But your destiny...

43:33.844 --> 43:36.213
is yours. Only yours.

43:37.448 --> 43:38.949
I can't intercede.

43:44.922 --> 43:47.992
Your father gave me this
when he came to São Paulo.

43:49.293 --> 43:50.961
He asked me to give it to you.

43:52.630 --> 43:54.665
My father
never had faith in God.

43:56.700 --> 43:58.636
He could have left me
many things,

44:00.170 --> 44:01.205
but a saint?

44:02.473 --> 44:06.010
Saint Lucy,
patron saint of the blind.

44:09.480 --> 44:10.514
Of the blind?

44:16.153 --> 44:17.554
Of the blind!
