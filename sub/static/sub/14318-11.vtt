00:01.625 --> 00:03.333
[Narrator]
Previously on X-Men.

00:03.333 --> 00:04.958
Could the government
be plotting against mutants?

00:04.958 --> 00:06.583
You wanted to see me,
Madam President?

00:06.583 --> 00:08.458
Stop all activities

00:08.458 --> 00:11.416
involving your privately-run
mutant registration program.

00:12.458 --> 00:15.166
-Who is she?
-Just a random name
from the files.

00:15.875 --> 00:17.208
-A test...
-No!

00:17.208 --> 00:18.458
...to see how easy it will be

00:18.458 --> 00:20.083
to capture the rest of them.

00:20.083 --> 00:22.000
[crowd protesting]

00:22.000 --> 00:24.875
-[Man] Down with mutants!
-[roaring]

00:24.875 --> 00:26.708
[Tv announcer]
Today the downtown area
was rocked

00:26.708 --> 00:28.375
by another outbreak
of violence.

00:29.125 --> 00:31.458
[people screaming]

00:35.208 --> 00:36.291
[Man]
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:36.875 --> 00:38.875
the world tonight
is in the grip

00:38.875 --> 00:40.875
of a terrible crisis.

00:40.875 --> 00:43.833
Since the President
recklessly rescinded

00:43.833 --> 00:45.458
the Mutant Registration Act,

00:46.000 --> 00:47.875
those unfortunate mistakes
of nature

00:47.875 --> 00:49.375
are running wild.

00:49.375 --> 00:51.291
As President, I intend

00:51.291 --> 00:53.166
to relocate every mutant

00:53.166 --> 00:54.958
in this nation
to internment camps.

00:54.958 --> 00:57.458
[Jean]
Fighting for human-mutant peace

00:57.458 --> 00:59.583
has just become more dangerous.

01:00.250 --> 01:01.375
[theme music playing]

02:20.625 --> 02:22.375
[dog barking]

02:23.875 --> 02:24.875
[grunting]

02:27.250 --> 02:28.250
[shushing]

02:36.208 --> 02:37.500
[Sentinel 1]
Halt, mutants!

02:39.208 --> 02:40.208
[Male mutant]
Another one!

02:41.500 --> 02:42.583
[Female mutant]
Back the other way!

02:50.333 --> 02:51.875
Gotta clear some trash.

02:55.125 --> 02:56.708
Surrender, or be...

03:16.333 --> 03:17.458
What a shame.

03:17.458 --> 03:19.000
Now we can't surrender.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.291
-[Sentinel 2] Halt!
-No!

03:23.750 --> 03:24.875
[grunting]

03:29.000 --> 03:30.375
That was close.

03:31.125 --> 03:34.250
Used to take those tin cans out
in half the time.

03:35.458 --> 03:37.000
Must be getting rusty.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
[Bishop]
I'll say.

03:39.166 --> 03:40.166
Tracker!

03:52.208 --> 03:53.416
[growling]

03:54.875 --> 03:56.333
[groaning]

03:56.333 --> 03:57.708
[clanging]

04:00.250 --> 04:02.291
Scratch three rebels.

04:02.291 --> 04:03.625
[grunting]

04:11.083 --> 04:13.375
Awake already, Sleeping Beauty?

04:14.000 --> 04:15.416
[grunting]

04:15.416 --> 04:16.625
[screaming]

04:22.208 --> 04:24.375
You heal up pretty fast

04:24.375 --> 04:25.750
-for an old guy.
-[beeping]

04:25.750 --> 04:27.000
Thanks a lot!

04:28.125 --> 04:30.958
Hey, don't I know you
from somewhere?

04:31.458 --> 04:33.166
Good try, rebel,

04:33.958 --> 04:37.083
but you're heading
to a mutant termination center,

04:37.083 --> 04:39.708
and the Sentinels there
don't care who you know.

04:39.708 --> 04:42.583
Why can't you rebels stop
attacking those bucket heads?

04:43.125 --> 04:45.458
All it gets you is termination.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.333
Wake up, rookie.

04:47.958 --> 04:50.291
The Sentinels want to kill
all mutants.

04:50.833 --> 04:52.708
Just you rebels, old man.

04:53.125 --> 04:54.958
They treat the rest of us
just fine.

04:59.500 --> 05:03.000
-[beeping]
-ID, tracker, Bishop.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.250
Three recoveries.

05:07.583 --> 05:09.416
So, where's my money?

05:09.416 --> 05:12.125
Tracker Bishop
recovery quota reached.

05:12.750 --> 05:15.458
Tracker Bishop
no longer needed.

05:15.458 --> 05:18.166
-What do you mean?
-Terminate them all.

05:18.583 --> 05:20.208
So, what do you think

05:20.208 --> 05:22.958
of their new
retirement policy, rookie?

05:22.958 --> 05:24.500
Shut up, old man.

05:25.458 --> 05:26.458
[shushing]

05:40.583 --> 05:43.500
-[growling]
-The legendary X-Men.

05:44.208 --> 05:45.875
Do not delay, mutant.

05:50.833 --> 05:52.958
[grunting, growling]

05:52.958 --> 05:55.291
Move, rookie!
This ain't no dress rehearsal.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.333
[growling]

06:08.000 --> 06:09.125
Hey!

06:10.958 --> 06:12.375
Watch the material.

06:12.375 --> 06:13.500
[groaning]

06:21.375 --> 06:22.416
Thanks, kid.

06:22.875 --> 06:24.083
The name's Bishop.

06:24.083 --> 06:25.750
-[rumbling]
-Now what?

06:28.458 --> 06:29.500
[Wolverine]
Party's over.

06:30.500 --> 06:32.625
Someone invited Nimrod.

06:33.083 --> 06:35.500
Wolverine, go! The mission!

06:36.083 --> 06:37.458
Yeah, yeah. I'm going.

06:37.458 --> 06:38.458
I'm going.

06:45.083 --> 06:46.083
[footsteps]

06:50.333 --> 06:52.708
Open up! It's me, Wolverine!

06:55.458 --> 06:57.583
This is Bishop. He's with me.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.250
Bishop, say hello to Forge.

07:00.875 --> 07:02.000
We must hurry.

07:02.458 --> 07:03.500
[Bishop]
Yeah, right.

07:05.458 --> 07:06.458
You are injured.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Who, me?

07:09.000 --> 07:11.583
You rebels
have a working time portal?

07:17.208 --> 07:19.000
Got the, uh, transponder?

07:19.416 --> 07:21.000
The temporal transceiver.

07:21.750 --> 07:23.291
It maintains you in time.

07:25.166 --> 07:28.250
The transceiver should get you
where you need to go.

07:28.250 --> 07:29.250
Take care.

07:29.833 --> 07:31.875
Without it, you'll crash back
to our time.

07:32.458 --> 07:34.000
[Bishop]
Where exactly is that?

07:34.708 --> 07:36.458
Or make that "When?"

07:36.458 --> 07:37.875
The '90s.

07:37.875 --> 07:39.166
Why then?

07:39.166 --> 07:40.250
The assassination.

07:40.750 --> 07:43.583
We rebels have a theory.

07:44.416 --> 07:47.458
If the assassination
of the '90s never occurred...

07:47.458 --> 07:49.750
Then none of this misery
would have happened?

07:50.500 --> 07:52.583
None of the Sentinels,
none of the camps,

07:53.083 --> 07:54.708
none of the terminations?

07:54.708 --> 07:55.750
As stated,

07:56.416 --> 07:58.000
it is only a theory.

07:58.458 --> 08:00.958
Make sure he takes it out
after I go.

08:01.583 --> 08:02.708
I don't want anyone

08:03.166 --> 08:05.250
or anything following me.

08:05.250 --> 08:07.083
But how are you planning
to get back?

08:07.625 --> 08:08.708
[Wolverine]
I'm not.

08:09.125 --> 08:11.000
[Bishop]
Save some egg-sucking big shot,

08:11.000 --> 08:13.416
and suddenly everybody loves
each other?

08:13.875 --> 08:14.875
Yeah, right.

08:15.375 --> 08:17.958
You got any better ideas,
we're listening.

08:18.458 --> 08:21.083
You figured out a way
to stop that assassination?

08:21.500 --> 08:22.708
Yeah.

08:22.708 --> 08:24.625
By stopping the assassin.

08:24.625 --> 08:26.000
But that means
you're going after--

08:26.000 --> 08:27.875
I know who I'm going after.

08:27.875 --> 08:30.208
You really think you'll be able
to pull the trigger?

08:30.208 --> 08:31.250
Out of my way!

08:31.250 --> 08:32.500
[alarm beeping]

08:33.750 --> 08:36.083
Sentinels.
Sooner than anticipated.

08:36.583 --> 08:40.000
I'd love to stay, but I've got
an assassination to stop.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.333
No, you don't.

08:41.833 --> 08:44.875
I'm going. You couldn't
handle me, old man.

08:44.875 --> 08:46.625
You'll never handle an X-Man.

08:47.291 --> 08:48.750
[growling]

08:48.750 --> 08:51.291
Bishop is right,
and his youth is an asset.

08:51.750 --> 08:53.583
[Wolverine]
You mean I'm too old?

08:54.083 --> 08:57.000
With the transceiver,
he'll have all the information
he needs.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.250
I'm gonna
remember this, rookie!

09:03.708 --> 09:05.875
[roaring]

09:09.375 --> 09:10.375
Go in peace.

09:11.875 --> 09:12.958

09:21.625 --> 09:23.208

[birds chirping]

09:50.458 --> 09:51.708
[laughing]

09:52.416 --> 09:55.083
Big surprise.
The portal didn't work.

09:55.875 --> 09:57.708
Should have just taken
the subway.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.375
[Boy 1 laughing]

10:02.083 --> 10:03.583
[Boy 1]
Come on, over this way.

10:05.458 --> 10:06.708
Children?

10:06.708 --> 10:08.291
On the street?

10:08.291 --> 10:09.708
In daylight?

10:09.708 --> 10:11.000
[Boy 2]
Come on, let's get out of here.

10:18.291 --> 10:19.875
It did work!

10:19.875 --> 10:21.416
What year is this?

10:21.416 --> 10:22.708
Why am I here?

10:22.708 --> 10:23.958
I can't remember!

10:24.625 --> 10:26.000
Think. Think.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.458
Think!

10:29.875 --> 10:33.125
Monday, the 11th, 19...

10:33.833 --> 10:35.750
Man, I did go back in time.

10:36.708 --> 10:37.958
But to do what?

10:38.458 --> 10:40.625
"Professor Charles Xavier

10:41.083 --> 10:42.291
delivers speech

10:42.291 --> 10:44.833
on recent mutant persecution."

10:44.833 --> 10:46.125
I'm here to find...

10:47.208 --> 10:48.208
Xavier?

10:49.875 --> 10:51.708
[Rogue]
I figured you read
this one already.

10:52.375 --> 10:53.750
But the cover
looked pretty good.

10:54.875 --> 10:55.958
Thomas Wolfe.

10:56.416 --> 10:58.958
An old favorite. I thank you.

10:58.958 --> 11:01.000
Beast here is easy to shop
for, no?

11:02.000 --> 11:04.708
Just buy the books
with the most dust on them.

11:04.708 --> 11:06.125
Beast, really,

11:06.875 --> 11:08.250
how you doing in here?

11:08.250 --> 11:10.458
"Stone walls
do not a prison make

11:10.458 --> 11:12.333
nor iron bars a cage."

11:12.333 --> 11:14.375
You're right.
These days they use

11:14.375 --> 11:16.333
concrete and titanium.

11:16.875 --> 11:19.000
Please, Gambit,
I must see this through

11:19.000 --> 11:20.875
to the end, my way.

11:20.875 --> 11:23.291
For the odd game of solitaire,
is all.

11:23.291 --> 11:26.250
Though I can't see
how you can stand it in here.

11:28.208 --> 11:30.416
In fact, I'm getting
out of here.

11:30.416 --> 11:32.875
Gambit, though I am always
in haste,

11:32.875 --> 11:34.208
I am never in a hurry.

11:34.583 --> 11:36.375
Rogue, I'll be outside.

11:36.375 --> 11:38.833
What got stuck
in Gambit's craw?

11:38.833 --> 11:41.500
Everyone has his or her own
demons to battle.

11:42.333 --> 11:44.416
It would appear
our friend Gambit

11:44.416 --> 11:46.625
may have encountered some
in prison before.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.208
[Bishop]
The legends live.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.166
The X-Men.

12:11.166 --> 12:12.500
The unstoppable.

12:12.500 --> 12:13.875
[rat squeaking]

12:13.875 --> 12:15.750
Why can't I remember?

12:16.333 --> 12:19.375
Come on, let's play
your new cartridge, Assassin.

12:21.083 --> 12:22.500
Cartridge?

12:22.500 --> 12:23.583
Assassin?

12:24.166 --> 12:25.375
What assassin?

12:26.375 --> 12:29.458
What am I supposed to do
about an assassin?

12:29.458 --> 12:31.458
[Automated voice]
Take target. Target.

12:32.166 --> 12:34.291
-Target... out.
-[beeping]

12:34.291 --> 12:35.291
Take out.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.166
Take out.

12:37.166 --> 12:38.333
The assassin.

12:38.333 --> 12:40.500
The X-Men. Oh, man!

12:42.166 --> 12:44.875
The X-Men are the assassins.

12:46.208 --> 12:48.583
And I've come back
to stop them.

12:55.875 --> 12:56.875
[coin clanging]

12:59.500 --> 13:01.458

[truck honking]

13:19.250 --> 13:21.166
Security check,
everything clear.

13:22.250 --> 13:23.500
Whoa, wait a sec.

[both exclaim]

13:44.875 --> 13:46.083
[gasps]

13:48.583 --> 13:49.875
Assassins!

13:53.583 --> 13:55.583
For the future!

13:55.583 --> 13:56.833
[groaning]

13:58.750 --> 14:00.166
I must stop you all!

14:05.333 --> 14:06.458
For the future!

14:08.250 --> 14:11.125
Okay, you, you're out of here!

14:11.125 --> 14:12.250
[grunting]

14:15.750 --> 14:16.750
[groaning]

14:17.416 --> 14:19.000
Stop this!

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
[groaning]

14:21.875 --> 14:23.583
[roaring]

14:23.583 --> 14:26.166
I'm gonna
remember this, rookie!

14:27.708 --> 14:29.708
I'm gonna
remember this, rookie.

14:30.958 --> 14:32.250
Wolverine!

14:32.250 --> 14:34.291
It's me! Don't!

14:34.375 --> 14:36.125
Come on!

14:36.125 --> 14:37.833
[Xavier]
Stop! Stop it!

14:37.833 --> 14:40.208
Wolverine, killing him

14:40.208 --> 14:42.583
won't answer
any of my questions.

14:42.708 --> 14:44.625
But I have to stop you!

14:44.625 --> 14:46.458
Don't you understand,
Wolverine?

14:46.458 --> 14:48.708
It's the only way
to save us all!

14:49.333 --> 14:50.458
The guy's nuts!

14:50.875 --> 14:53.125
Cyclops, check everyone
for injuries,

14:53.125 --> 14:54.583
then meet in the War Room.

14:54.583 --> 14:56.833
I think we'll need
Cerebro's help with this.

14:57.625 --> 15:00.125
This arm thingy is way weird.

15:00.125 --> 15:02.750
I can't figure out
how to cross-patch it.

15:02.750 --> 15:04.958
-Anything?
-Wherever he's from,

15:05.458 --> 15:07.583
if this is the next new weapon,

15:07.583 --> 15:08.875
we're in big trouble.

15:08.875 --> 15:10.708
Be glad it was on stun.

15:11.166 --> 15:13.583
The blast potential
in just one of these cartridges

15:13.583 --> 15:15.458
reads right off the scale!

15:15.458 --> 15:17.875
It's like nothing I've ever
seen before.

15:18.500 --> 15:19.875
It's got to be a setup.

15:19.875 --> 15:21.000
We've got this thing hooked up.

15:21.583 --> 15:25.000
Are you ready for me
to try to help you, Bishop?

15:25.000 --> 15:26.625
Do I have a choice?

15:27.208 --> 15:28.250
[beeping]

15:31.708 --> 15:32.708
I'm...

15:33.125 --> 15:35.458
getting a jumble of images.

15:36.250 --> 15:38.416
Dark, frightening.

15:38.416 --> 15:40.750
[crowd protesting]

15:41.958 --> 15:44.333
[footsteps]

15:47.708 --> 15:49.625
[Jubilee]
What are we supposed
to be seeing here?

15:53.000 --> 15:55.250
[Storm]
I think it is the future.

15:56.875 --> 15:58.583
This guy's a faker!

15:58.583 --> 16:00.291
I can sense his feelings.

16:00.708 --> 16:01.708
They seem genuine.

16:05.583 --> 16:07.458
At least I don't lose my hair.

16:07.958 --> 16:10.291
[groaning]

16:11.125 --> 16:12.583
[Xavier]
I have seen the future!

16:13.125 --> 16:14.500
We have failed.

16:14.500 --> 16:16.083
All is lost.

16:16.083 --> 16:17.500
How can it be?

16:18.083 --> 16:20.708
A world condemned to darkness.

16:21.208 --> 16:23.416
And it's all our fault.

16:23.416 --> 16:26.458
You can't mean you believe
this guy's really
from the future.

16:26.958 --> 16:28.208
It's some kind of trap.

16:28.583 --> 16:30.708
I know what I saw.

16:30.708 --> 16:32.500
The flake tried to kill us,

16:33.000 --> 16:35.875
and you're willing to buy
his half-baked story

16:35.875 --> 16:37.875
about some terrible future?

16:37.875 --> 16:40.500
But what about
this way weird weapon?

16:40.500 --> 16:42.375
Are any of you listening?

16:42.750 --> 16:44.458
Mr. Terminator here claims

16:44.458 --> 16:46.833
that an assassination's
gonna take place

16:46.833 --> 16:48.708
that's gonna ruin the world,

16:48.708 --> 16:51.375
and one of us X-Men
is the trigger!

16:51.375 --> 16:52.458
[transceiver beeping]

16:53.833 --> 16:54.875
What's going on?

16:54.875 --> 16:56.208
Someone in the future

16:56.208 --> 16:57.583
stealing your car?

16:57.583 --> 17:00.291
Someone or something

17:00.291 --> 17:02.250
has come back
through the time portal.

17:02.333 --> 17:03.583
Check, please!

17:04.000 --> 17:06.875
Time portal?
Give me a break!

17:06.875 --> 17:09.000
This is not open
for discussion.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.875
Cyclops, let him loose.

17:11.875 --> 17:13.458
You're in charge of the team.

17:14.083 --> 17:17.375
We have to help Bishop
piece together his mission.

17:17.375 --> 17:19.166
I don't want their help.

17:19.166 --> 17:21.250
Don't forget why I'm here.

17:21.250 --> 17:23.500
[Wolverine]
You think I'm letting you
out of my sight,

17:23.500 --> 17:25.500
you're even crazier
than I thought.

17:28.708 --> 17:31.083
[Cyclops]
This thing shows
something glowing.

17:31.083 --> 17:33.750
Looks kind of like a door.

17:33.750 --> 17:35.458
[Bishop]
Residual energy
from the portal.

17:35.458 --> 17:38.333
Temporal displacement
definitely took place.

17:38.333 --> 17:39.333
Oh, yeah.

17:39.750 --> 17:41.125
I thought I felt a shift

17:41.125 --> 17:43.291
in the planet's
alignment there.

17:43.291 --> 17:45.833
Uh, so, who came through?

17:45.833 --> 17:46.833
Not who.

17:47.583 --> 17:49.458
-What.
-[screaming]

17:51.625 --> 17:52.625
[grunts]

17:54.625 --> 17:55.833
[Bishop]
It's Nimrod!

17:58.208 --> 18:01.125
You mean
that itty-bitty soup can?

18:01.125 --> 18:02.875
Give me five seconds, I'll...

18:05.458 --> 18:06.583
[grunting]

18:08.208 --> 18:09.583
A new Sentinel?

18:09.583 --> 18:11.583
From my time, from the future!

18:14.250 --> 18:15.875
-[Storm groaning]
-Bishop, help!

18:15.875 --> 18:17.583
Storm's claustrophobic!

18:17.583 --> 18:19.000
Nimrod can sense it!

18:21.458 --> 18:22.458
[Jubilee]
Back off, jerk!

18:26.583 --> 18:27.583
[Jean exclaims]

18:29.583 --> 18:31.458
[growling]

18:32.500 --> 18:33.583
Jean!

18:36.625 --> 18:37.708
[screaming]

18:38.125 --> 18:39.458
What can we do?

18:39.458 --> 18:41.208
It's impervious to our weapons.

18:42.166 --> 18:44.958
He has not yet felt
the force of the elements!

18:52.000 --> 18:53.083
Hail!

18:53.458 --> 18:55.875
Fill the skies
with rocks of ice!

18:59.125 --> 19:00.583
[Bishop]
Increase the cold!

19:00.583 --> 19:02.208
Maybe we can crack
the super structure!

19:03.083 --> 19:04.750
From the ends of the Earth,

19:04.750 --> 19:07.458
send limitless cold upon him!

19:17.166 --> 19:18.166
We did it!

19:18.583 --> 19:20.500
No! It's only restructuring!

19:20.500 --> 19:22.250
We only got a few seconds!

19:24.208 --> 19:25.208
[beeping]

19:28.583 --> 19:29.958
[Jubilee]
What happened to him?

19:29.958 --> 19:32.166
I took out
its temporal transceiver.

19:32.708 --> 19:35.583
It's what keeps me here
now that I am here.

19:36.125 --> 19:39.333
Anything happens to this,
I'll rip back through time.

19:39.333 --> 19:41.375
Just like what happened
to Nimrod?

19:41.375 --> 19:42.583
Oh, man!

19:42.583 --> 19:44.250
I believe him now.

19:44.250 --> 19:45.333
Great.

19:45.875 --> 19:48.166
Then I want you
to tell me one thing.

19:49.333 --> 19:51.583
Which one of us
is the assassin?

19:52.000 --> 19:53.416
I don't remember.

19:54.166 --> 19:55.708
It could be any of you.

19:56.375 --> 19:58.000
It couldn't be Jean.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.333
Of course it could.

19:59.833 --> 20:01.750
I've had my dark days,

20:01.750 --> 20:03.083
or have you forgotten?

20:03.083 --> 20:04.583
But, Jean.

20:04.583 --> 20:05.833
[Storm]
It could be any one of us.

20:06.500 --> 20:09.333
We all have dark sides
to our souls.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.166
Speak for yourself, lady.

20:11.583 --> 20:14.125
The only person I'm interested
in taking out

20:14.125 --> 20:15.500
is our man Bishop here

20:16.083 --> 20:17.708
if he's lying to us.

20:19.083 --> 20:21.833
My, my, don't you all look
serious!

20:22.625 --> 20:24.875
And we've got company, too.

20:24.875 --> 20:27.583
-What's up?
-[Gambit] Everyone can relax.

20:28.833 --> 20:30.708
Gambit has returned.

20:31.458 --> 20:32.458
You!

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
You're the reason
I've come back!

20:35.000 --> 20:37.625
Mon ami,
there has been, maybe,

20:37.625 --> 20:39.458
a small mistake.

20:39.458 --> 20:42.291
Traitor! Your future ends now!
