00:12.679 --> 00:13.873
This sucks dick.

00:14.047 --> 00:15.776
I hate swimming.

00:15.949 --> 00:18.509
Oh, just shut up and give me
a hand with this shit.

00:18.685 --> 00:19.982
What the hell are you doing?

00:20.153 --> 00:21.211
What does it look like?

00:21.388 --> 00:24.016
- I'm hiding the Jet Ski.
- Why are you hiding the Jet Ski?

00:24.190 --> 00:27.250
Because I told Dustin-
Look, I can't talk with you...

00:27.427 --> 00:29.418
...with your tits hanging
out like cabbages.

00:29.596 --> 00:31.587
- Just give me a hand with this.
- Screw you.

00:31.765 --> 00:33.630
You threw me in the fucking lake, Kenny.

00:33.800 --> 00:34.926
Fine.

00:37.003 --> 00:39.471
Now, I think your body is awesome.
You got great tits.

00:39.639 --> 00:42.073
But I'm a little concerned
about your bill of health.

00:42.242 --> 00:44.506
I insist upon you
using some sort of protection.

00:44.677 --> 00:47.145
Got a dental dam in the glove
compartment of my truck.

00:47.313 --> 00:49.679
- You can grab that.
- What the fuck's a dental dam?

00:49.849 --> 00:52.682
A rubber for your mouth.
It's not that big of a deal, okay?

00:52.852 --> 00:55.320
And besides,
it's not just for my protection.

00:55.488 --> 00:57.251
You don't know what shit I got either.

01:03.163 --> 01:05.154
Pakistani?

01:05.498 --> 01:07.762
- That's what he told me.
- Whoa.

01:07.934 --> 01:10.732
How does somebody manage
to get ambushed on a Jet Ski?

01:10.904 --> 01:15.102
I don't know. I guess they jumped them
and rode off with it.

01:15.275 --> 01:16.674
Yeah, but I mean, it's a lake.

01:16.843 --> 01:19.403
There ain't exactly places
to sneak up on somebody from.

01:19.579 --> 01:20.739
You'd need scuba gear.

01:20.914 --> 01:23.781
- I don't know, Dustin.
- Snorkel, maybe.

01:25.819 --> 01:27.184
What's he out there doing?

01:27.353 --> 01:31.847
Actually, I think he's in training...

01:32.659 --> 01:33.853
...for the majors.

01:34.027 --> 01:36.723
Oh, going back to the majors.

01:38.598 --> 01:39.656
All right, boys.

01:39.833 --> 01:41.460
Let's get back into baseball, okay?

01:41.634 --> 01:44.034
Wayne, keep that pistol
aimed at the strike zone...

01:44.204 --> 01:46.695
...because that is
where this bad boy's going.

01:47.507 --> 01:50.305
All right. Fly as I say fly.

01:50.477 --> 01:53.878
Do as I say do.
Master and commander.

01:59.119 --> 02:03.146
And the crowd goes crazy.

02:06.459 --> 02:08.289
- Sixty-eight.
- What did I tell you, man?

02:08.461 --> 02:11.157
Don't read the readout.
That's my own private information.

02:11.331 --> 02:12.730
Why didn't you hit the target?

02:12.899 --> 02:15.163
Because at the last moment,
I decided not to.

02:15.335 --> 02:18.634
I decided to go for that birdbath
your dad put in there just-

02:18.805 --> 02:21.899
I'm trying so hard not to be an asshole
to you guys, okay?

02:22.075 --> 02:24.305
Just please work with me here.

02:24.477 --> 02:26.206
I'm sorry. I'm not mad at you guys.

02:26.379 --> 02:28.040
I'm just disappointed with my arm...

02:28.214 --> 02:30.876
...and how it's trying
to butt-fuck me back here.

02:31.050 --> 02:34.110
- I hated that birdbath.
- I broke that for you. I knew you hated it.

02:34.287 --> 02:36.050
We're the same. I hate that thing too.

02:36.222 --> 02:37.985
A stork wrapped around a tree branch.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.456
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever seen before.

02:40.627 --> 02:43.187
You know, that's how the plague
started back in the day.

02:43.363 --> 02:46.355
It was from a little disgusting birdbath
in someone's backyard...

02:46.533 --> 02:52.130
...that rats made sex to birds in it
and created a whole new type of AIDS.

02:52.305 --> 02:56.105
It's important. One time,
I was invited to come to a social gathering.

02:56.276 --> 02:58.005
I was paid a handsome
amount of money.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.373
I brought a shotgun
and a bottle of Tanqueray...

03:00.547 --> 03:02.879
...and showed them the best time
they've ever seen.

03:03.049 --> 03:06.644
A humongous part about being a celebrity
is cashing in on it...

03:06.819 --> 03:10.721
...making shitloads of money,
having expensive, luxurious things.

03:10.890 --> 03:13.256
That way, in case one day
you're not famous...

03:13.426 --> 03:17.795
...you could still be rich as hell
and better than everyone around you.

03:32.445 --> 03:35.209
Wait a second. Is Kenny Powers
walking around my showroom?

03:35.381 --> 03:37.008
- Quite possibly.
- How are you doing?

03:37.183 --> 03:40.084
- Who am I speaking to?
- Ashley Schaeffer, Ashley Schaeffer BMW.

03:40.253 --> 03:41.880
- Damn fine to meet you.
- Okay.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.080
- I take it you own this place.
- I sure do.

03:44.257 --> 03:45.986
My name's on the goddamn building.

03:46.159 --> 03:48.389
I thought Ashley Schaeffer
was gonna be a woman.

03:48.561 --> 03:51.052
I love women.
I'll take that as a compliment.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.596
Take it as you will.

03:52.765 --> 03:54.756
- I will.
- You should.

03:54.934 --> 03:57.027
I am. I'm taking it.

03:57.203 --> 04:00.263
- Pretty nice showroom you got.
- Thank you. We have a lot of pride.

04:00.440 --> 04:03.307
We've done a lot of work lately.
Complete renovations.

04:03.476 --> 04:06.377
We got beautiful cars.
Beautiful surroundings.

04:06.546 --> 04:08.571
- Yeah.
- Beautiful women.

04:08.748 --> 04:11.740
- Oh, yeah. They are pretty hot, huh?
- They're my closers.

04:11.918 --> 04:15.410
Yeah, they help people
who are slightly hesitant to buy cars.

04:15.588 --> 04:17.351
- So if you happen to be a man...
- Yeah.

04:17.523 --> 04:19.491
...Ashley over there will suck your dick.

04:19.659 --> 04:20.853
I like how you work.

04:21.027 --> 04:22.426
If you happen to be a woman...

04:22.595 --> 04:24.586
...Scott will finger you with his penis.

04:26.566 --> 04:29.000
That's the kind of fun and games
we have around here.

04:29.168 --> 04:30.760
Oh, you get it done?

04:30.937 --> 04:34.338
Whoa! Okay. That's not what you do,
not in my neighborhood.

04:34.507 --> 04:36.134
We do around here. We also do this.

04:36.309 --> 04:38.209
- No, that's not-
- That's what we do here.

04:38.378 --> 04:39.470
- We're having fun.
- Okay.

04:39.646 --> 04:42.774
- It's so good to have you in here.
- I'm gonna cut to the chase.

04:42.949 --> 04:45.042
- Please, do.
- I'm an athlete.

04:45.218 --> 04:47.209
But I'm also a businessman.

04:47.387 --> 04:50.015
- You got a classy joint here.
- Yeah.

04:50.189 --> 04:56.059
And you're trying to lure costumers in
with a caveman spinning a sign around.

04:56.229 --> 04:58.060
It's actually technically an orangutan.

04:58.231 --> 05:00.756
Well, just seems to me
an establishment such as this...

05:00.933 --> 05:03.800
...could go for an overhaul
in the advertising spokesman game.

05:03.970 --> 05:07.872
I'm talking about a real celebrity,
not some sign-spinning fucking monkey.

05:08.641 --> 05:10.768
I'm talking about goddamn me
in the store...

05:10.943 --> 05:13.070
...live, uncut, in person.

05:13.246 --> 05:16.443
Bringing in the customers,
lubing the deals.

05:16.616 --> 05:18.311
Holy shit!

05:18.484 --> 05:21.248
This must be my goddamn
fucking lucky day.

05:21.421 --> 05:24.083
First off, Kenny Powers
walks into my showroom.

05:24.257 --> 05:26.487
Then he says he wants
to do a personal appearance.

05:26.659 --> 05:28.957
It's goddamn amazing!

05:29.128 --> 05:30.220
Yeah.

05:30.396 --> 05:32.057
Yeah, I got a lot of star power.

05:32.365 --> 05:35.163
And I think it would make this night
a grand success.

05:35.335 --> 05:39.738
And I think it'll only cost you 2 grand.

05:40.073 --> 05:42.940
Yeah, I'm gonna pay you 100 bucks.

05:44.477 --> 05:47.310
You sure you don't wanna maybe
meet in the middle somewhere?

05:47.480 --> 05:49.175
How about 200 bucks?

05:50.650 --> 05:53.278
- Two hundred bucks to come-?
- Two hundred bucks, cash.

05:53.453 --> 05:54.852
And a blowjob.

05:55.021 --> 05:56.488
- Fuck you, man.
- Yeah, okay.

05:56.689 --> 05:57.815
- Fuck you.
- Just kidding.

05:58.024 --> 06:00.151
Hey, guys, bring the fucking ape in here.

06:24.550 --> 06:26.450
Good morning, Kenny.

06:26.619 --> 06:28.746
Now, part of becoming
a professional athlete...

06:28.921 --> 06:31.219
...is being strong and fit.

06:31.391 --> 06:34.326
Another part is staying strong and fit.

06:34.494 --> 06:37.759
That is a part that
I myself am currently involved with.

06:37.930 --> 06:39.295
Example A:

06:39.465 --> 06:44.334
I can stand to lose four, maybe five pounds
to get back in practical game condition.

06:44.504 --> 06:45.528
No shit.

06:45.705 --> 06:48.037
- What did you just say?
- Nothing.

06:48.708 --> 06:51.040
Let's do this.
I got my two favorite students here.

06:51.210 --> 06:55.544
They're gonna spot me
252 pounds of pure steel.

06:55.715 --> 06:57.876
Let's pump some iron, bitches.

06:58.050 --> 06:59.711
Okay.

06:59.886 --> 07:00.978
Take this serious, guys.

07:01.154 --> 07:03.884
You can get hurt
if you're not strong enough, okay?

07:04.056 --> 07:06.286
Okay. Watch, class.

07:06.459 --> 07:07.687
Masculine strength.

07:07.860 --> 07:11.455
One, two, three.

07:11.898 --> 07:13.729
Okay, yeah, help me. Help me out. Okay.

07:13.900 --> 07:15.925
All right, back up, back up. Get away.

07:16.102 --> 07:17.433
Oh, shit!

07:17.603 --> 07:19.036
Oh, fuck me!

07:19.205 --> 07:20.832
Spot me, goddamn it!

07:21.007 --> 07:22.031
Get it off of me!

08:01.547 --> 08:04.243
Yo, what's happening over here
with the babes?

08:04.417 --> 08:07.113
- Fall dance.
- Oh, a dance, huh?

08:07.286 --> 08:08.753
Would you like to buy a ticket?

08:08.921 --> 08:11.253
All the profits go toward
Phillip's hospital bills.

08:11.424 --> 08:13.654
Who the fuck is Phillip?

08:14.560 --> 08:17.120
He's one of our students here.
He has brain cancer.

08:17.296 --> 08:19.924
- I've never seen that kid.
- "Spina diffia," I think.

08:20.099 --> 08:23.091
Whatever the fuck any of that stuff is,
I don't know him.

08:23.269 --> 08:24.793
He gets a dance?

08:24.971 --> 08:27.735
No, I'm not going
to any depressing shit like that.

08:27.907 --> 08:29.135
Too sensitive.

08:29.308 --> 08:31.572
Okay, well, Kenny,
I hate to burst your bubble...

08:31.744 --> 08:34.269
...but it looks like your name
is on the chaperon list.

08:34.447 --> 08:37.143
I don't know anything about
a chaperon list. What is that?

08:38.083 --> 08:41.611
It's right here and it says
that you're a teacher supervisor.

08:42.922 --> 08:44.446
Are you asking me to this dance?

08:44.924 --> 08:47.825
No, I'm not. I'm just saying
your name is on the chaperon list.

08:47.994 --> 08:50.963
April, are you asking me to this dance?

08:51.130 --> 08:52.495
No.

08:53.699 --> 08:55.326
When is this dance?

08:55.501 --> 08:57.128
- It's tonight.
- Tonight?

08:57.303 --> 08:58.827
You mean, "tonight" tonight?

08:59.005 --> 09:01.064
Fuck that noise.
I can't do anything tonight.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.208
- I got some shit set up already.
- What?

09:03.376 --> 09:06.174
- I'm hosting this celebrity event tonight.
- Really?

09:06.345 --> 09:08.108
Yeah, I'm getting paid like 15 notes.

09:08.781 --> 09:10.874
Okay, well, if you can't come,
you can't come.

09:11.050 --> 09:14.508
You don't have to get upset.
I'm sorry I can't go to the dance with you.

09:14.687 --> 09:19.386
You'll have to chalk this up to another
heartbreak, just like back in high school.

09:20.960 --> 09:23.520
How much will y'all give me
if I slam-dunk this thing...

09:23.696 --> 09:25.561
-... into the trashcan?
- Nothing. Nothing.

09:31.103 --> 09:32.570
D- Ball, what are you doing, man?

09:32.738 --> 09:34.603
Goddamn it, Kenny,
I'm brushing my teeth.

09:34.774 --> 09:36.503
I need you to give me a ride.

09:37.443 --> 09:39.274
- What's wrong with your truck?
- Nothing.

09:39.445 --> 09:41.345
- I just need you to drive me around.
- Why?

09:41.514 --> 09:44.176
Well, Schaeffer BMW is gonna pay me
a shit-ton of money...

09:44.350 --> 09:46.614
...to make a little celebrity
appearance tonight.

09:46.786 --> 09:49.186
Yeah. And, I don't know.

09:49.355 --> 09:54.054
I just feel like it'll be stupid if I drive myself,
because I'm famous.

09:54.860 --> 09:57.761
All right. I'll drive you there
and you can find your way back.

09:57.930 --> 10:00.592
I need you to stay the whole time.
That's what drivers do.

10:00.766 --> 10:03.098
Drivers don't drive you there
and then drive off.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.829
If you're gonna do this,
you have to do it the full way.

10:06.005 --> 10:09.099
- I might even need you to wear a uniform.
- Forget it, Kenny.

10:09.275 --> 10:12.005
No one's gonna look down on you
because you drove yourself.

10:12.178 --> 10:14.544
Now, close the door.
Get the fuck out of here.

10:14.714 --> 10:17.239
What's with them yellow towels?
Those are pretty-

10:17.416 --> 10:19.543
Give me that, motherfucker.

10:20.052 --> 10:22.145
I saw your dick.

10:23.522 --> 10:25.046
Give me that toilet paper, Kenny.

10:27.827 --> 10:31.524
Come on, you wanna give me a ride?
Wanna be my personal chauffeur tonight?

10:31.697 --> 10:33.688
- I got enough.
- That's not enough.

10:33.866 --> 10:36.027
I smelled that motherfucker.
You need more.

10:36.202 --> 10:38.864
You have crossed the line.
Give me the toilet paper now.

10:39.739 --> 10:40.865
Fine.

10:41.807 --> 10:44.241
Turtle-walk your ass out of here.
Thanks for nothing.

10:44.410 --> 10:45.843
Kenny!

10:46.946 --> 10:48.538
Kenny!

10:48.714 --> 10:50.545
Man, this thing's got some power.

10:50.716 --> 10:53.412
Don't rev my shit.
I'm trying to do something serious here.

10:53.586 --> 10:56.111
I don't need you going
fucking maverick on me.

10:56.288 --> 10:58.620
All right, it's up here on the left.

10:59.225 --> 11:01.090
- Where?
- Clegg, to the left, dude.

11:01.260 --> 11:03.694
- Where? There?
- The fucking place says Schaeffer BMW.

11:03.863 --> 11:06.423
- Please, go left.
- All right, I got it, I got it.

11:07.299 --> 11:09.529
Fuck you, asshole!

11:10.603 --> 11:13.367
All right, here we are.

11:13.539 --> 11:16.838
Man, this feels good, Clegg.

11:17.276 --> 11:19.403
Did you take one
of those black beauties?

11:19.578 --> 11:21.102
The ecstasy?

11:21.280 --> 11:23.180
No, dude. This is a real job.

11:23.349 --> 11:26.250
It's not like teaching kids.
You can't get fucked up.

11:26.419 --> 11:29.946
What feels good is just this.

11:30.189 --> 11:32.453
Back in the spotlight, man.

11:32.625 --> 11:34.149
Right where I belong.

11:34.326 --> 11:37.784
All right!
Kenny Powers is here, everyone!

11:37.963 --> 11:39.191
Let's hear it.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.697
Let's hear it. Keep going. Keep it going.

11:41.867 --> 11:44.836
Kenny Powers. That's Kenny Powers.

11:45.004 --> 11:46.699
He doesn't do this all the time.

11:47.039 --> 11:48.506
Kenny!

11:48.674 --> 11:51.700
- Turn around. Look at them, man.
- Hey, how's it going, guys?

11:51.877 --> 11:53.242
Why'd you bring a football?

11:54.046 --> 11:56.276
Shelby's bad boy
is back in business, huh?

11:56.449 --> 11:58.542
Oh, yes, he is. Yes, he is.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.118
Are you nervous tonight?
You feel a lot of emotions?

12:01.287 --> 12:06.554
I feel 110 percent.
Ready to move some BMWs tonight!

12:07.793 --> 12:08.885
That's it.

12:09.061 --> 12:11.222
It's a big night.
What are you gonna go with...

12:11.397 --> 12:13.365
...your fastball or your cut fastball?

12:13.532 --> 12:14.794
Maybe a forkball?

12:14.967 --> 12:17.367
Maybe just signing some balls instead.

12:17.536 --> 12:19.595
- Signing some balls?
- Yeah.

12:19.772 --> 12:21.831
It's not a microphone.

12:22.007 --> 12:23.474
- It's not a microphone.
- I know.

12:23.642 --> 12:25.610
We're just having fun. Come on.

12:25.778 --> 12:28.303
- How's it going?
- You ready to get this thing going?

12:28.481 --> 12:30.540
- Let's do it.
- Yeah. Scott.

12:30.716 --> 12:32.081
Why don't you throw that on?

12:32.251 --> 12:35.220
- What's this?
- That's an Ashley Schaeffer BMW polo.

12:35.387 --> 12:36.615
- Put that on.
- Right now?

12:36.789 --> 12:37.813
Yeah, right now.

12:37.990 --> 12:40.185
No offense,
but I kind of think the all-black...

12:40.359 --> 12:42.919
...is more indicative of
the Kenny Powers rebel persona.

12:43.095 --> 12:45.120
Scott, heads up. Thank you.

12:45.297 --> 12:46.594
Look, I paid you $200, okay?

12:46.766 --> 12:49.064
I wanna see Ashley Schaeffer BMW
on your tit.

12:49.235 --> 12:50.998
- All right?
- Whoa!

12:51.170 --> 12:54.196
Easy. I don't play games like that.

12:55.174 --> 12:57.199
This isn't a game.

13:00.813 --> 13:03.873
All right, everybody,
who wants to meet Kenny Powers?

13:04.049 --> 13:06.609
Kenny Powers.
What the fuck is up with you, man?

13:07.219 --> 13:09.517
You know me.
Who am I making this shit out to?

13:09.688 --> 13:12.555
Well, Kenny, my name's Kevin Hickman
and I want you to know...

13:12.725 --> 13:15.694
...even though your career's hit
a real sour patch lately...

13:15.861 --> 13:19.297
...I'm still your number one goshdarn fan,
man, 100 percent.

13:19.465 --> 13:22.263
That's great. There you go, sport.
Take a hike.

13:23.202 --> 13:25.033
Well, actually, the thing is, Kenny...

13:25.204 --> 13:28.867
...I was wondering if maybe you might
burn one down the middle for me.

13:29.041 --> 13:31.202
I brought my glove and it'd mean a lot.

13:31.377 --> 13:33.743
Well, obviously, I'd love to,
you know, do that...

13:33.913 --> 13:36.609
...but I don't think it would be fair
to the other people-

13:36.782 --> 13:37.942
Oh, hell, Kenny, come on.

13:38.117 --> 13:40.210
I think you're underestimating
your fan base.

13:40.386 --> 13:42.081
I mean, who in their right mind...

13:42.254 --> 13:44.984
...wouldn't wanna
see the Kenny Powers...

13:45.157 --> 13:47.591
...give us a little display
of that God-given talent?

13:47.760 --> 13:49.751
- All right!
- Who wouldn't wanna see that?

13:49.929 --> 13:53.831
Well, the thing is, you know,
I didn't even warm the old whip up.

13:53.999 --> 13:57.696
I got Polynesian sauce all over my fingers
from eating these goddamn egg rolls.

13:57.870 --> 14:01.601
I'd hate if I slipped up and put a hole in
one of these top-of-the-line vehicles.

14:01.774 --> 14:03.503
Nonsense! Come on, man!

14:04.243 --> 14:07.804
I'm Ashley Schaeffer.
I got a whole lot full of goddamn BMWs.

14:07.980 --> 14:10.642
Who wouldn't wanna see you
burn a hole through one, right?

14:10.816 --> 14:12.408
- Yeah!
- The people wanna see it!

14:12.585 --> 14:14.075
Yeah!

14:17.122 --> 14:18.555
Yeah, come on!

14:20.693 --> 14:22.684
- Here we go, okay?
- Take it easy on me.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.330
Hell with that. Smoke that fool.

14:26.131 --> 14:28.122
It's Kenny Powers. Come on, everyone.

14:29.368 --> 14:32.030
- Come on.
- Go on.

14:38.110 --> 14:42.570
Sorry, sorry. I can't do it.
Not gonna do it. Can't do it.

14:42.915 --> 14:45.349
I'll be goddamned
if I fork out 200 bucks...

14:45.517 --> 14:47.781
...and I'm flat-out denied
a single goddamn pitch.

14:47.953 --> 14:49.511
Throw the damn ball.

14:50.055 --> 14:51.716
Pitch was never part of the deal.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.222
I'm sorry to be a stickler...

14:53.392 --> 14:55.952
...but I throw one to him,
next thing you know...

14:56.128 --> 14:58.653
...I'm at the grocery store, the bar,
the titty club...

14:58.831 --> 15:01.265
...and every fucker I pass
is asking me to smoke one.

15:01.433 --> 15:03.594
I can't open myself up to that.

15:03.769 --> 15:07.796
If I didn't know any better, I'd think
Kenny Powers is afraid to throw a baseball.

15:09.241 --> 15:11.175
Come on, it's been that long, huh?

15:11.343 --> 15:13.402
- No.
- Forget your trade?

15:13.579 --> 15:15.945
Come on, it's a simple motion,
just like that.

15:16.115 --> 15:18.515
You got a little tendinitis or something?
Come on.

15:18.684 --> 15:22.017
How about this: Roll it on the ground,
pretend like it's a bowling ball?

15:22.187 --> 15:25.554
No, how about we just go back
and we'll sign the rest of the balls-?

15:25.724 --> 15:27.749
How about you throw the ball, all right?

15:27.927 --> 15:31.488
Come on. These people wanna see a show
and I don't wanna be embarrassed.

15:31.664 --> 15:34.462
Well, you're doing a good job
of that on your own...

15:34.633 --> 15:36.100
...just by how you fucking look.

15:36.268 --> 15:38.736
I thought you were a baseball pitcher.

15:39.004 --> 15:41.097
- Know what-?
- Thought you were a ball player.

15:41.273 --> 15:42.706
- I am a ball player.
- Are you?

15:42.875 --> 15:44.467
- I'm not a goddamn ape.
- Really?

15:44.643 --> 15:46.736
- Yeah. I'm not-
- So far, I don't believe it.

15:46.912 --> 15:48.539
You know what? Fuck you.

15:48.714 --> 15:50.204
Fuck this, fuck all you people.

15:50.382 --> 15:53.510
Good luck selling these stupid fucking cars.
I'm not helping you.

15:53.686 --> 15:58.020
Hey, hey, hey. You know you're not
gonna get paid if you walk out of here.

16:02.328 --> 16:03.420
Good Lord.

16:03.595 --> 16:05.995
You're a loser. You are an ape.

16:12.237 --> 16:14.637
Bye, Kenny. Bye, Kenny Powers.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.832
Bye, Kenny.

16:17.009 --> 16:19.341
Hey, fuck you, Kenny!

16:23.682 --> 16:25.411
Clegg!

16:26.085 --> 16:27.916
Clegg!

16:28.854 --> 16:30.822
Clegg!

16:31.023 --> 16:33.753
- Clegg!
- Kenny!

16:34.426 --> 16:35.916
Kenny!

16:36.095 --> 16:37.426
What are you doing?

16:37.830 --> 16:39.525
What's up?

16:39.698 --> 16:41.529
Dude, it's time to roll! Come on!

16:41.700 --> 16:44.430
See? Look, I told you I know him.

16:44.703 --> 16:47.968
- Kenny!
- Come on!

16:48.140 --> 16:50.005
I gotta go. I gotta go.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.836
Where were you?
Told you to wait in the car.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.676
Why is there silver shit
all over your face?

16:57.850 --> 17:00.114
I was hanging with those dudes
in the parking lot.

17:00.285 --> 17:03.254
Doing what? Giving Robocop a blowjob?

17:03.422 --> 17:04.787
Are you crying?

17:04.957 --> 17:06.617
No!

17:06.825 --> 17:08.656
Do you still have that ecstasy?

17:27.579 --> 17:30.673
He's with me. Don't bust balls.

17:32.384 --> 17:34.511
My friends are here. They're-

17:51.770 --> 17:54.170
Fucking awesome!

18:04.516 --> 18:06.848
I'm not gonna get out
on that dance floor with you.

18:07.019 --> 18:08.850
It would be inappropriate.
What is this?

18:09.021 --> 18:10.511
Now you're gonna dance with her?

18:10.689 --> 18:12.384
- That's different.
- I see how it is.

18:12.558 --> 18:14.685
- Okay, come on, come on.
- I see how it is.

18:26.205 --> 18:29.697
Hey, everybody really turned it out
for Phillip tonight, don't you think?

18:29.875 --> 18:33.106
It's a pretty good party.

18:33.846 --> 18:36.440
Pretty- All right.

18:44.590 --> 18:46.956
- Hi, how are you?
- What are you doing here?

18:47.126 --> 18:49.686
- I thought you had a big event.
- Yeah, I did.

18:50.696 --> 18:53.392
I cancelled it. I'm not an ape.

18:53.565 --> 18:55.430
I'm a professional ball player.

18:55.901 --> 18:59.359
I need to be around people
who understand that.

19:01.306 --> 19:04.241
Are you okay?
Because you're sweating a lot.

19:04.409 --> 19:07.606
April, I gotta come clean, babe.

19:07.779 --> 19:12.079
There's one image in my life
that consistently makes me happy...

19:12.251 --> 19:14.651
...no matter when I think about it,
and that image-

19:14.820 --> 19:16.685
That one image is your big tits.

19:16.855 --> 19:18.823
- Oh, Kenny-!
- No, listen.

19:18.991 --> 19:21.255
I'm not trying to be crude with you.
This is real.

19:21.426 --> 19:23.121
This is me being honest with you.

19:23.295 --> 19:24.353
You're inappropriate.

19:24.530 --> 19:27.499
- Love is inappropriate sometimes.
- There are children present.

19:27.666 --> 19:31.329
What a better place for me to say my love
than surrounded by little angels?

19:31.503 --> 19:33.300
This is about real emotions.

19:33.472 --> 19:37.602
This is about me loving you for real.

19:37.776 --> 19:40.438
And not in a "just to make me come"
kind of way.

19:40.612 --> 19:42.580
In a real way. All right.

19:43.982 --> 19:49.818
If you won't listen to my words,
then listen to my dancing feet.

19:58.230 --> 19:59.356
Oh, my.

19:59.531 --> 20:00.793
Work, drugs.

21:08.900 --> 21:09.924
Call a janitor.

21:18.443 --> 21:20.877
Do you think he's okay?

21:21.747 --> 21:25.410
Yeah, I think he just got overheated.

21:25.617 --> 21:28.643
- You doing okay there, Kenny?
- I'm fine.

21:28.820 --> 21:31.584
It was the egg rolls, not the ecstasy.

21:31.757 --> 21:35.887
Okay. Well, we're gonna
get you a ride home, all right?

21:37.929 --> 21:38.953
No.

21:42.234 --> 21:43.496
Clegg!

21:45.737 --> 21:48.604
Well, we raised a lot of money
for Phillip tonight, huh?

21:48.774 --> 21:50.935
That was pretty good.

21:51.176 --> 21:53.303
That's right, Stevie.

21:53.478 --> 21:55.275
Clegg!

21:58.283 --> 22:01.184
- Clegg.
- Everybody's gone, Kenny.

22:01.353 --> 22:04.948
- He was supposed to wait for me.
- Who's that?

22:06.058 --> 22:07.992
My driver.

22:08.860 --> 22:09.986
You have a driver?

22:10.162 --> 22:11.629
Of course, I do. I'm famous.

22:11.797 --> 22:14.527
Oh, okay.
Well, why don't you come with me, Kenny?

22:14.700 --> 22:17.168
- I'll give you a ride.
- No.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.668
I'm going home.

22:27.245 --> 22:29.509
Well, see you Monday.

22:44.896 --> 22:46.955
Kenny. Kenny, stop.

22:49.167 --> 22:51.328
You look like you could use a friend.

22:51.503 --> 22:53.061
What'd you just say?

22:53.238 --> 22:55.138
You look like you could use a ride.

22:55.440 --> 22:57.101
Well, maybe I could.

22:57.275 --> 22:58.606
Is that such a crime?

22:58.777 --> 23:01.041
No, it's not a crime.

23:01.213 --> 23:05.741
I'd give you a ride gladly, Kenny Powers.

23:06.518 --> 23:08.179
Funny thing.

23:08.353 --> 23:09.945
When you're on top of the world...

23:10.122 --> 23:13.853
...every motherfucker wants
to get a piece of your ass.

23:14.025 --> 23:17.586
But then you take a little time off
from being unstoppable...

23:17.763 --> 23:21.927
...just to regroup and relax...

23:22.100 --> 23:25.695
...no one will give you
the time of fucking day.

23:25.871 --> 23:29.739
This face used to cash fucking checks.

23:29.908 --> 23:31.933
And this dick...

23:36.515 --> 23:39.973
I guess Kenny Powers
ain't what he used to be.

23:41.987 --> 23:44.979
No, you- I can imagine.
I saw you lots on TV.

23:45.157 --> 23:48.320
Your face did cash a lot of checks.

23:48.493 --> 23:51.326
I don't know about the dick, though.

23:53.398 --> 23:55.263
What the fuck is your name again?

23:57.436 --> 24:00.337
Stevie. It's Stevie Janowski.

24:05.043 --> 24:06.908
All right, Stevie Janowski.

24:07.078 --> 24:08.841
I accept your offer.

24:18.490 --> 24:21.288
Can we go
to Ashley Schaeffer BMW first?

24:22.027 --> 24:25.622
Yes. Anything you want, Kenny Powers.

24:25.797 --> 24:27.662
Anything at all.
