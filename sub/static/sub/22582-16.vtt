00:12.004 --> 00:14.472
- Bio-signs?
- None that I can detect.

00:14.604 --> 00:17.721
But its hull seems to be scattering
our sensors.

00:18.004 --> 00:19.483
Any idea what happened?

00:19.604 --> 00:24.075
I'm not reading any weapon signatures.
Possibly some sort of accident.

00:29.684 --> 00:31.834
Bring it into Launch Bay 2.

00:46.444 --> 00:48.400
There's no windows.

00:49.524 --> 00:53.722
I'm not sure whether this end's
the bow or the stern.

00:57.924 --> 00:59.118
Captain.

01:01.324 --> 01:03.235
This might be a hatch.

01:03.644 --> 01:05.874
If it is, it's been fused shut.

01:06.404 --> 01:08.793
With your permission, sir?

02:32.884 --> 02:34.636
He's human.

02:41.564 --> 02:43.953
It's been a long road

02:45.964 --> 02:48.524
Gettin' from there to here

02:48.844 --> 02:51.312
It's been a long time

02:52.444 --> 02:55.880
But my time is finally near

02:56.244 --> 02:59.919
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

03:00.724 --> 03:03.557
I will touch the sky

03:04.004 --> 03:07.633
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

03:07.764 --> 03:10.517
No, they're not gonna change my mind

03:10.644 --> 03:14.876
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

03:15.324 --> 03:18.316
I'm going where my heart will take me

03:18.444 --> 03:22.642
I've got faith to believe

03:23.004 --> 03:25.723
I can do anything

03:25.844 --> 03:29.757
I've got strength of the soul

03:30.204 --> 03:33.082
And no one's gonna bend or break me

03:33.204 --> 03:37.322
I can reach any star

03:38.724 --> 03:40.840
I've got faith

03:42.484 --> 03:45.317
I've got faith

03:46.204 --> 03:49.480
Faith of the heart

04:05.244 --> 04:07.121
This was a human male.

04:07.244 --> 04:10.361
A microcellular scan should tell us
his age at the time of death.

04:10.924 --> 04:13.392
Apparently,
you're not the first humans out this far.

04:13.524 --> 04:15.719
Whoever this is,
he's rewritten our history books.

04:16.964 --> 04:18.317
Can you get a DNA sample?

04:18.444 --> 04:19.797
The tissue damage is extensive...

04:19.923 --> 04:22.518
but I should be able to isolate
a few fragments.

04:22.644 --> 04:24.157
If he was a member of Starfleet...

04:24.284 --> 04:26.639
his genetic profile
is probably in our database.

04:27.564 --> 04:30.476
- Run a comparison as soon as you can.
- Absolutely.

04:33.084 --> 04:35.234
There aren't any ships
or inhabited systems...

04:35.364 --> 04:37.116
for several light-years.

04:41.124 --> 04:45.800
I wonder if this could be
Zefram Cochrane.

04:46.964 --> 04:49.842
They say he was piloting a one-man
vessel when he disappeared.

04:49.964 --> 04:52.114
How could he have travelled this far?

04:53.084 --> 04:55.678
There were a lot of rumours
after he was lost.

04:55.844 --> 04:59.837
One of them said he was testing
some kind of experimental warp ship.

05:00.964 --> 05:03.353
Any markings on the hull
or control panels?

05:03.484 --> 05:04.917
We haven't found any.

05:05.884 --> 05:08.557
The hull seems to absorb EM radiation.

05:09.364 --> 05:11.594
Without all this damage...

05:11.724 --> 05:14.079
it never would've shown up
on our sensors.

05:14.364 --> 05:16.036
Some kind of stealth ship.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.520
So what do you think, Travis?

05:19.804 --> 05:22.159
Could this pilot have been
a cargo hauler?

05:22.884 --> 05:25.842
We're more than 30 light-years
from the nearest trade route.

05:26.164 --> 05:28.439
I don't see how he could have
made it out this far.

05:28.564 --> 05:30.282
Maybe he got a ride from someone.

05:31.804 --> 05:34.443
That's got to be a world record
for hitchhiking.

05:36.164 --> 05:38.632
I still can't find
any plasma exhaust ports...

05:38.964 --> 05:40.636
not even a thruster quad.

05:41.524 --> 05:44.516
There's nothing here
that looks like a power source.

05:46.964 --> 05:49.876
How did this thing make it
into deep space without an engine?

05:50.004 --> 05:51.562
Could be an escape pod.

05:53.524 --> 05:56.800
Even an escape pod would need
some kind of propulsion system.

05:59.084 --> 06:01.154
Any new mission
you haven't told us about?

06:01.284 --> 06:02.512
I wish there was.

06:02.644 --> 06:06.000
It's possible the ship you found
was launched from Vega Colony but...

06:06.764 --> 06:08.755
they're a long way behind you now.

06:10.444 --> 06:13.163
The Earth Cargo Authority
may have more information.

06:13.284 --> 06:16.162
Phlox has sent a request
to Dr. Cochrane's family.

06:16.804 --> 06:19.238
They're transmitting his genetic profile.

06:19.644 --> 06:21.714
100 light-years from Earth.

06:21.884 --> 06:22.919
You might have solved...

06:23.044 --> 06:25.797
the greatest missing-person case
of the century.

06:26.244 --> 06:31.034
If we haven't, we've discovered
an even bigger mystery.

06:42.924 --> 06:43.959
Commander.

06:48.684 --> 06:51.596
Registers as some kind of biomatter.

06:52.244 --> 06:53.916
Organic circuitry?

06:54.044 --> 06:56.604
Maybe we should get Phlox
to come down and take a look.

06:56.724 --> 06:57.873
Not a bad idea.

07:11.644 --> 07:13.043
What's this?

07:33.044 --> 07:35.194
- Malcolm?
- I see it.

07:35.324 --> 07:38.043
Good. Means I'm not hallucinating.

07:38.684 --> 07:41.801
How could a ship be bigger
on the inside than the outside?

07:43.244 --> 07:45.075
Could be a hologram.

07:47.644 --> 07:49.316
Hand me that hyperspanner.

08:05.284 --> 08:08.799
- You're not going down there?
- Got to get my spanner back.

08:08.924 --> 08:11.154
We should call the Bridge first.
Let them know...

08:11.284 --> 08:12.683
Say again, Malcolm?

08:45.324 --> 08:48.919
This gives "space exploration"
a whole new meaning.

08:49.764 --> 08:52.232
I've read a few papers
on spatial geometry.

08:53.124 --> 08:55.922
I never heard a theory
that would explain this.

08:57.324 --> 08:59.474
The Captain will never believe us.

08:59.604 --> 09:01.993
He's going to have
to see this for himself.

09:02.684 --> 09:06.199
What do you think, a warp reactor?

09:06.884 --> 09:08.476
You're the engineer.

09:10.724 --> 09:15.036
Looks like a breach,
overload of some kind.

09:15.844 --> 09:17.960
I'm picking up an energy signature.

09:20.324 --> 09:21.723
It's very faint.

09:23.924 --> 09:26.154
Sir, a vessel's dropped out of warp.

09:26.804 --> 09:28.760
They're on an intercept course.

09:28.884 --> 09:30.158
It's Suliban.

09:32.964 --> 09:34.192
Let's see it.

09:38.084 --> 09:41.520
Minimal weapons.
I don't believe it's a combat ship.

09:41.644 --> 09:42.872
We're being hailed.

09:47.684 --> 09:49.720
You have something that belongs to us.

09:51.444 --> 09:53.514
I don't believe I've had the pleasure...

09:53.644 --> 09:56.681
We have a salvage claim
on the vessel in your launch bay.

09:56.804 --> 09:59.272
One of our cell ships discovered it
three days ago.

09:59.404 --> 10:00.803
We were sent to retrieve it.

10:00.924 --> 10:04.314
That ship's an Earth vessel.
The pilot's human.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.560
I'm not interested in the corpse.

10:06.684 --> 10:09.517
Decompress your launch bay
and release the vessel.

10:14.284 --> 10:15.717
I'm curious.

10:17.324 --> 10:19.440
What's your interest in that ship?

10:20.084 --> 10:21.676
There's not much left.

10:21.804 --> 10:24.318
The vessel, now.

10:24.764 --> 10:26.402
They're charging weapons.

10:27.084 --> 10:29.439
You might want to contact
your superiors.

10:29.804 --> 10:32.364
Ask for a man named Silik.

10:33.484 --> 10:36.396
He'll tell you
I don't respond well to threats.

10:55.084 --> 10:56.836
This could be a release pin.

11:06.844 --> 11:08.596
Let's get it to Engineering.

11:16.724 --> 11:17.998
Forward plating is holding.

11:18.124 --> 11:19.796
Bring us about, Travis.

11:20.324 --> 11:22.042
Power the phase-cannons.

11:22.524 --> 11:24.604
See what you can do
about their weapons.

11:30.004 --> 11:31.483
Tucker to the Bridge.

11:35.044 --> 11:36.443
The comm's down.

11:50.444 --> 11:51.763
Commander!

12:04.404 --> 12:06.360
Someone's trying to open Launch Bay 2.

12:06.484 --> 12:07.633
Lock them out.

12:09.004 --> 12:10.198
I can't.

12:10.764 --> 12:12.277
Archer to Trip.

12:15.404 --> 12:18.476
Send a security team down there.
Return fire.

12:25.844 --> 12:27.516
Their weapons have been disabled.

12:27.644 --> 12:30.078
Target their engines
and bring the grappler online.

12:30.204 --> 12:31.159
Sir?

12:31.284 --> 12:34.356
They wanted that ship pretty badly.
I'd like to know why.

12:35.364 --> 12:36.717
They're moving off.

12:38.564 --> 12:39.758
Stay with them.

13:01.524 --> 13:03.082
I've lost them, sir.

13:10.964 --> 13:12.795
Captain's Starlog, supplemental.

13:12.964 --> 13:15.319
We've contacted the Vulcan ship,
Tal'Kir.

13:15.444 --> 13:18.800
They've agreed to meet us in three days
to take the craft back to Earth.

13:18.924 --> 13:21.563
Hopefully, we won't have another visit
from the Suliban...

13:21.684 --> 13:23.595
before we reach the rendezvous point.

13:24.964 --> 13:26.477
It was heavily shielded.

13:26.604 --> 13:28.993
Whatever this thing is,
it must be pretty important.

13:29.124 --> 13:32.241
- What's your guess?
- Might be the black box.

13:32.364 --> 13:35.436
It could tell us what happened,
maybe even who built the vessel.

13:35.564 --> 13:37.282
That's assuming we can get it working.

13:37.404 --> 13:40.441
It seems to use the same
organic circuitry as the rest of the ship.

13:40.564 --> 13:44.239
I gotta take you down into that chamber.
You're not going to believe your eyes.

13:44.364 --> 13:45.797
Bigger on the inside?

13:45.924 --> 13:47.596
Sickbay to Captain Archer.

13:48.164 --> 13:50.803
- Archer.
- I need to see you immediately.

13:55.964 --> 13:59.115
I managed to find
only a few undamaged cells.

13:59.244 --> 14:01.883
But they were enough to complete
a genetic analysis.

14:04.964 --> 14:06.955
Any match in the Starfleet database?

14:07.164 --> 14:10.952
No. But I did discover
that our guest is no ordinary human.

14:11.964 --> 14:15.843
I found an unusual deviation
in this nucleotide sequence.

14:15.964 --> 14:18.637
At first, I thought I was looking
at some kind of mutation...

14:18.764 --> 14:21.676
but there was something familiar
about the chromosome structure.

14:21.804 --> 14:25.160
So I widened my search to include
the interspecies database.

14:25.524 --> 14:29.119
This nucleotide sequence is Vulcan.

14:34.484 --> 14:36.714
How did a human
end up with Vulcan DNA?

14:36.844 --> 14:40.314
The likeliest explanation is that he had
at least one Vulcan ancestor...

14:40.444 --> 14:42.435
further back than a great-grandparent.

14:42.564 --> 14:45.761
That's not possible. We haven't known
the Vulcans long enough.

14:45.884 --> 14:49.672
I also found genetic material
belonging to several other species.

14:50.844 --> 14:54.883
This sequence is Terrellian.
There's another I can't identify.

14:59.004 --> 15:01.040
I believe this individual is the result...

15:01.164 --> 15:03.917
of several generations
of interspecies breeding.

15:07.044 --> 15:09.922
Thank you, Doctor. T'Pol.

15:12.884 --> 15:14.795
A database from the future?

15:14.924 --> 15:18.234
Our time-travelling friend, Daniels,
left it in his quarters.

15:25.884 --> 15:28.034
I'm not certain
Daniels would approve of this.

15:28.804 --> 15:30.522
We'll keep it to ourselves.

15:47.884 --> 15:52.036
A Vulcan cruiser.
I don't recognise the configuration.

15:52.644 --> 15:54.953
That's because it hasn't been built yet.

16:00.284 --> 16:04.072
Few Vulcans have ever chosen
to mate with another species.

16:04.804 --> 16:07.921
Worried about contaminating
your genome with a little human DNA?

16:08.444 --> 16:10.912
There are
significant biological differences...

16:11.044 --> 16:12.397
between the species.

16:12.644 --> 16:14.680
It's unlikely we could reproduce.

16:17.124 --> 16:18.523
Humans and Vulcans.

16:24.644 --> 16:25.963
That could be it.

16:27.044 --> 16:29.239
The dorsal section is the wrong shape.

16:33.684 --> 16:36.994
If a human and a Vulcan
did have a child...

16:37.604 --> 16:39.674
I wonder if he'd have pointed ears.

16:43.044 --> 16:45.399
There. I think that's it.

16:51.884 --> 16:55.763
Look at the commission date.
That's almost 900 years from now.

16:59.244 --> 17:01.758
Daniels talked about historians
from the future...

17:01.884 --> 17:03.875
people who travelled back
to study the past.

17:04.003 --> 17:05.960
That could be what this pilot was doing.

17:06.964 --> 17:09.955
This says it's powered
by a temporal displacement drive.

17:10.604 --> 17:12.959
If the Suliban get their hands on this...

17:14.124 --> 17:15.682
they'll take it apart...

17:16.644 --> 17:19.204
maybe learn how the engine works.

17:19.924 --> 17:22.518
That could change the course
of the Temporal Cold War.

17:22.763 --> 17:27.554
Assuming the vessel is from the future,
why haven't they retrieved it?

17:32.924 --> 17:33.913
Archer.

17:34.044 --> 17:36.956
Sir, another alien vessel's approaching
at high warp.

17:37.484 --> 17:40.362
- Suliban?
- No, sir. We can't identify them.

17:53.244 --> 17:55.553
20,000 kilometres and closing.

17:57.844 --> 18:00.756
- T'Pol?
- The vessel's Tholian.

18:01.044 --> 18:02.363
They're extremely xenophobic.

18:02.484 --> 18:04.918
The High Command's had
limited contact with them.

18:05.044 --> 18:08.514
Captain, it's unusual for Tholians
to travel this far from their system.

18:08.644 --> 18:11.204
I'm getting unusual thermal readings.

18:11.324 --> 18:13.519
It's awfully warm inside that ship...

18:13.764 --> 18:15.277
more than 200 degrees.

18:15.404 --> 18:17.964
They're believed to be
a non-humanoid species.

18:20.164 --> 18:21.483
Open a channel.

18:23.684 --> 18:26.403
This is Captain Archer of the Starship...

18:27.244 --> 18:28.802
Jonathan Archer...

18:31.484 --> 18:33.918
please establish communication.

18:34.044 --> 18:36.000
Is there something we can do for you?

18:38.244 --> 18:40.917
We were sent to retrieve the vessel.

18:43.084 --> 18:45.644
I'd like to know how you heard
about that ship.

18:46.564 --> 18:51.433
It is dangerous to you.
Temporal radiation.

18:54.244 --> 18:58.123
Thanks for the warning,
but we can't give it to you.

19:00.844 --> 19:02.960
They've locked onto us
with a tractor beam.

19:03.084 --> 19:04.563
We're losing speed.

19:05.164 --> 19:07.724
Hull plating, arm the aft torpedoes.

19:07.844 --> 19:10.722
That beam's interfering
with our targeting scanners.

19:11.844 --> 19:16.235
Release us, or I'll destroy the ship
in our launch bay.

19:24.124 --> 19:25.523
Do you hear me?

19:35.124 --> 19:37.433
- What did he say?
- I don't know...

19:38.324 --> 19:40.997
but I don't think
he was paying you a compliment.

19:46.324 --> 19:48.679
I wonder if there's anyone else...

19:49.044 --> 19:51.763
who thinks they have a claim
on that ship.

20:05.444 --> 20:07.958
- May I join you?
- Please.

20:10.284 --> 20:13.401
I found another nucleotide sequence
in the pilot's genome.

20:13.604 --> 20:17.199
It appears to be Rigellian.
That corpse is full of surprises.

20:22.404 --> 20:24.235
I didn't realise how late it was until...

20:24.364 --> 20:26.719
my stomach reminded me
it was time to eat.

20:29.084 --> 20:31.757
You seem to be engrossed in your work,
as well.

20:32.484 --> 20:33.963
The Captain asked me to perform...

20:34.084 --> 20:36.279
a metallurgical analysis
of the vessel's hull.

20:36.764 --> 20:37.913
Anything noteworthy?

20:38.204 --> 20:43.073
I've discovered several unusual alloys,
one of them is in a semi-fluidic state.

20:44.724 --> 20:47.363
- More mysteries.
- To say the least.

20:50.244 --> 20:52.599
I understand Captain Archer believes...

20:52.764 --> 20:55.198
that the vessel travelled here
from the future.

20:55.764 --> 20:57.038
That's his theory.

20:57.164 --> 20:59.041
Genetic anomalies,
unexplainable alloys...

20:59.164 --> 21:00.961
the evidence seems to be mounting.

21:01.324 --> 21:02.439
Perhaps.

21:03.684 --> 21:05.561
The Vulcan Science Directorate.

21:06.404 --> 21:10.192
They've always been rather reluctant
to embrace unorthodox ideas.

21:10.764 --> 21:12.197
After they review our findings...

21:12.324 --> 21:15.680
I have a feeling they might reconsider
their opinion of time travel.

21:16.164 --> 21:19.042
It's not an opinion. It's simple logic.

21:19.284 --> 21:21.718
There was a time
when Denobulans believed they were...

21:21.844 --> 21:24.404
the only intelligent species
in the galaxy.

21:25.084 --> 21:29.521
Needless to say, it was quite a surprise
when the B'Saari made first contact.

21:29.724 --> 21:31.237
Many refused to accept the truth...

21:31.364 --> 21:34.197
even with the evidence standing
right in front of them.

21:34.724 --> 21:38.797
It took some time, and it wasn't easy,
but eventually, we were forced...

21:39.324 --> 21:41.554
to re-evaluate our beliefs.

21:43.244 --> 21:46.042
Are you saying you believe
time travel is possible?

21:46.564 --> 21:48.680
Surprises, Subcommander...

21:49.204 --> 21:51.638
I believe in embracing surprises.

21:52.604 --> 21:54.799
I prefer to embrace logic.

21:57.804 --> 22:01.001
- Lf you'll excuse me, Doctor.
- Good night.

22:09.164 --> 22:12.201
All right, let's start re-initialising
the power grid.

22:12.364 --> 22:14.355
Assuming that is the power grid.

22:16.404 --> 22:18.599
It boggles the mind, if you think about it.

22:18.804 --> 22:20.157
What does?

22:20.724 --> 22:23.841
That ship could be
from the 31st century.

22:24.444 --> 22:27.481
When I was young, I always wanted
to build a time machine...

22:27.644 --> 22:28.793
see the future.

22:28.924 --> 22:30.960
You're probably the kind of person
that jumps...

22:31.084 --> 22:33.120
to the end of the book
before you read it.

22:33.244 --> 22:35.633
Don't tell me you've never wondered
what it'd be like...

22:35.764 --> 22:37.356
how our mission will turn out.

22:37.484 --> 22:40.920
Wondering about the future
and knowing it are two different things.

22:41.044 --> 22:44.832
If Daniels came here and offered you
a chance to go to the 31st century...

22:45.644 --> 22:47.123
you wouldn't take it?

22:49.964 --> 22:51.875
Some things are better left a mystery.

22:52.124 --> 22:54.433
And you call yourself an explorer.

22:54.604 --> 22:57.994
Where's the fun in exploring
if you know how it all turns out?

22:58.324 --> 23:00.121
Hand me that micro-caliper.

23:08.244 --> 23:10.712
Suppose you could look
into some future book...

23:10.844 --> 23:13.563
find out the name of the woman
you're going to marry.

23:14.204 --> 23:16.718
- Would you want to know it?
- Absolutely.

23:17.324 --> 23:20.361
Think of all the awkward first dates
I could avoid.

23:20.804 --> 23:24.001
Fine. So one day, you meet Jane Doe.

23:24.204 --> 23:26.957
You go out a few times,
then you pop the question.

23:27.084 --> 23:29.962
She says, "I do," and the two of you
live happily ever after.

23:30.164 --> 23:31.722
- Sounds perfect.
- Now...

23:32.404 --> 23:35.999
did you marry her for love
or because some book told you to?

23:36.964 --> 23:40.400
If we're happily ever after
what difference does it make?

23:45.604 --> 23:48.072
Well, we've got power.

23:48.924 --> 23:52.041
Now we've got to figure out
how to tap into these organic circuits.

23:52.204 --> 23:54.274
They're similar
to the ones in the cockpit.

23:55.084 --> 23:57.393
We might be able to salvage
some of them.

23:57.884 --> 23:59.397
Build an interface.

24:03.564 --> 24:06.920
Now if I had a chance to see the past,
I'd jump at it.

24:07.244 --> 24:09.075
I always wanted to meet a stegosaurus.

24:09.324 --> 24:11.280
He'd probably
make a quick meal of you.

24:11.484 --> 24:13.839
The stegosaurus was an herbivore.

24:15.364 --> 24:18.561
If I could travel back in time,
I know exactly what year I'd pick.

24:18.764 --> 24:22.234
- 1588.
- What happened in 1588?

24:22.644 --> 24:24.839
England defeated the Spanish Armada.

24:24.964 --> 24:28.320
I'm sure someone named Reed
had a lot to do with that.

24:29.484 --> 24:32.681
Now if I had a chance to see the past,
I'd jump at it.

24:33.164 --> 24:35.041
I always wanted to meet a stegosaurus.

24:35.164 --> 24:37.155
He'd probably
make a quick meal of you.

24:37.284 --> 24:40.356
The stegosaurus was an herbivore.

24:41.564 --> 24:43.600
It seems like we were just in here.

24:45.764 --> 24:48.642
If I could travel back,
I know exactly what year I'd pick.

24:48.884 --> 24:50.397
1588.

24:52.324 --> 24:54.679
How did I know
you were going to say that?

24:56.164 --> 24:58.883
I think we're spending
far too much time together.

24:59.764 --> 25:03.359
Now if I had a chance to see the past,
I'd jump at it.

25:04.084 --> 25:06.359
I always wanted to meet a stegosaurus.

25:08.644 --> 25:11.158
He'd probably
make a quick meal of you.

25:12.324 --> 25:14.440
The stegosaurus was an herbivore.

25:22.204 --> 25:25.002
It was the weirdest thing.
We were standing next to the ship...

25:25.124 --> 25:28.799
and it felt like we were having the same
conversation over and over again.

25:29.044 --> 25:31.638
I can't find anything wrong
with either of you.

25:32.124 --> 25:33.762
We didn't imagine what happened.

25:34.404 --> 25:38.955
Captain, the craft is emitting
some type of high-energy particles.

25:43.484 --> 25:46.794
This may be the temporal radiation
the Tholians warned us about.

25:46.924 --> 25:49.438
We've spent a fair amount of time
around that ship.

25:49.604 --> 25:53.597
The particle density's quite low.
It's unlikely to have any lasting effects.

25:53.724 --> 25:55.476
How do you explain what happened?

25:55.604 --> 25:58.562
The radiation could have affected
your perception of time.

25:58.724 --> 26:03.115
Or maybe they really were reliving
the same moment.

26:04.204 --> 26:05.717
Seal off Launch Bay 2...

26:05.924 --> 26:09.553
and evacuate the surrounding sections.
I don't want to take any chances.

26:10.364 --> 26:12.161
How are you coming with the black box?

26:12.284 --> 26:15.003
The power's online,
but we still can't access the data.

26:15.644 --> 26:18.238
Let me know as soon
as you find anything. Dismissed.

26:19.884 --> 26:21.397
Can I speak with you?

26:28.444 --> 26:32.722
The radiation could spread
to other sections, affect more systems.

26:33.884 --> 26:35.442
We'll keep an eye on it.

26:36.244 --> 26:38.394
The Vulcans are only a few hours away.

26:38.524 --> 26:40.594
I'm not certain we'll survive that long.

26:40.924 --> 26:43.563
We've attracted the attention
of two hostile species.

26:43.684 --> 26:46.118
It's logical to assume
they're searching for us.

26:46.844 --> 26:49.278
I'm pretty sure
we can steer clear of them.

26:51.084 --> 26:53.439
Perhaps you should destroy the vessel.

26:54.084 --> 26:55.802
I'm not going to do that.

26:56.724 --> 27:00.034
I'm tired of these factions
interfering with our century.

27:00.324 --> 27:02.838
It's time we took a more active interest
in this war...

27:02.964 --> 27:04.682
gathered some intelligence ourselves.

27:04.804 --> 27:08.843
Assuming for the moment
the Temporal Cold War exists...

27:09.884 --> 27:11.795
I believe we shouldn't get involved.

27:11.924 --> 27:15.280
Like it or not, we've been involved
since we left Spacedock.

27:19.244 --> 27:23.237
Daniels hinted that there were
other factions in this conflict.

27:24.444 --> 27:26.833
Maybe the Tholians are working
for one of them.

27:27.324 --> 27:30.953
Your curiosity is placing Enterprise
in unnecessary danger.

27:31.084 --> 27:33.644
This is the first chance we've had
to get some answers.

27:33.764 --> 27:35.038
I'm not going to pass it up.

27:35.684 --> 27:38.403
The Vulcans can get that ship
back to Earth in a few weeks.

27:38.524 --> 27:40.435
- Starfleet will take it from there.
- Captain...

27:40.564 --> 27:41.679
I told you...

27:44.524 --> 27:46.082
I've made my decision.

27:54.724 --> 27:57.158
If the Suliban return,
they may be cloaked.

27:57.444 --> 27:59.480
I recommend we go to Tactical Alert.

28:15.244 --> 28:17.235
- What do you have?
- It's what we don't have.

28:17.364 --> 28:20.436
This isn't a black box. We thought
it was a data-storage matrix...

28:20.564 --> 28:22.156
but after we got the power running...

28:22.284 --> 28:24.400
it started generating
a subspace signature.

28:24.524 --> 28:28.039
I think it's a microtransmitter,
some kind of emergency beacon.

28:28.324 --> 28:29.837
Bridge to Captain Archer.

28:29.964 --> 28:32.114
Several Suliban vessels
are approaching.

28:32.724 --> 28:35.158
- On my way.
- Acknowledged.

28:51.844 --> 28:54.756
The ships will be within weapons range
in 20 seconds.

28:56.324 --> 28:57.882
Go to maximum warp.

29:00.324 --> 29:02.042
They're matching our speed.

29:03.564 --> 29:06.442
- How long to the rendezvous point?
- Less than three minutes.

29:07.124 --> 29:10.719
Contact the Tal'Kir,
let them know we're bringing company.

29:10.964 --> 29:14.957
No response.
We're being hailed by the Suliban.

29:18.724 --> 29:20.601
I see you've brought
some friends with you.

29:20.724 --> 29:23.192
Drop out of warp
and prepare to be boarded.

29:23.324 --> 29:26.760
Or what? You're not going to risk
any more damage to that ship.

29:26.924 --> 29:28.198
They're charging weapons.

29:28.324 --> 29:30.360
Take a look at your long-range sensors.

29:30.724 --> 29:34.603
There's a Vulcan combat cruiser
a few million kilometres from here.

29:35.044 --> 29:38.275
Unless you want to upset them,
I suggest you turn around.

29:38.404 --> 29:41.714
The Vulcans won't risk their ship
for an Earth vessel.

29:45.604 --> 29:47.481
Aft cannon, return fire.

29:58.044 --> 29:59.557
We're losing ventral plating!

29:59.684 --> 30:01.993
- The Vulcans?
- 600,000 kilometres.

30:04.724 --> 30:08.160
Direct hit to the launch bay doors!
They're trying to blast them open!

30:08.324 --> 30:10.201
Hold your course and speed.

30:16.124 --> 30:19.116
- 200,000 kilometres.
- Take us out of warp.

30:35.364 --> 30:37.753
- Bio-signs?
- The crew's alive.

30:38.284 --> 30:41.674
- The vessel is disabled.
- Their comm system's down.

30:43.844 --> 30:45.277
Captain.

31:02.124 --> 31:03.762
Take us back to warp.

31:13.284 --> 31:16.003
- Engines are down.
- Weapons?

31:16.124 --> 31:18.877
They're off-line, too.
The hull plating is depolarising.

31:20.324 --> 31:22.519
The Cell Ships
have dropped out of warp.

31:32.684 --> 31:35.152
I never thought I'd be glad
to see the Suliban.

31:37.284 --> 31:39.593
Trip, we could use warp engines
right about now.

31:39.724 --> 31:43.194
The antimatter injectors are fused.
I'll need a few hours to replace them.

31:43.324 --> 31:44.313
How about weapons?

31:44.444 --> 31:46.719
Every power relay on the ship
has been scrambled.

31:46.844 --> 31:49.404
Then forget everything else.
Get that beacon working.

31:49.524 --> 31:50.479
Sir?

31:50.604 --> 31:53.072
Whoever built that ship
might be able to send help.

31:53.204 --> 31:54.319
Aye, Captain.

31:55.884 --> 31:59.035
Even if you're correct,
it's unlikely help will arrive in time.

32:01.964 --> 32:05.115
How long would it take to remove
one of the torpedo warheads...

32:05.244 --> 32:08.520
- arm it manually?
- Four minutes. Less if I had some help.

32:08.804 --> 32:12.001
I recommend moving the warhead
as little as possible once we remove it.

32:12.124 --> 32:13.637
We'll bring it to the launch bay...

32:13.764 --> 32:15.755
work on it there. You head the bridge.

32:27.124 --> 32:28.955
I'm going to hold you
to that four minutes.

32:29.084 --> 32:30.563
It was only an estimate, sir.

32:31.644 --> 32:33.316
They don't make this easy, do they?

32:33.444 --> 32:34.923
I'm going to release the couplings.

32:35.044 --> 32:37.035
You'll need to disconnect
the power conduits.

32:37.164 --> 32:38.517
The blue and red ones first.

32:38.684 --> 32:42.199
Turn the release counterclockwise
until you feel it detach.

32:49.644 --> 32:51.236
- Commander?
- I need that power module.

32:51.364 --> 32:52.399
Yes, sir.

33:01.844 --> 33:03.914
All right, hand me a micro-caliper.

33:11.684 --> 33:13.356
Bridge to Captain Archer.

33:15.164 --> 33:16.643
Go ahead.

33:16.884 --> 33:19.478
The Suliban have lost
more than half of their ships.

33:19.604 --> 33:22.357
- You don't have much time.
- We're working as fast as we can.

33:22.484 --> 33:23.519
Stand by.

33:23.644 --> 33:25.874
Sir, if you'll hold it
by the locking brace...

33:34.244 --> 33:36.360
I'm going to hold you
to that four minutes.

33:36.484 --> 33:38.520
It was only an estimate, sir.

33:38.644 --> 33:40.362
It's happening again.

33:41.444 --> 33:43.560
We've had this conversation before.

33:43.844 --> 33:45.243
You're right.

33:46.724 --> 33:49.522
- How far do you think we got last time?
- I'm not certain.

33:50.604 --> 33:52.674
I think we may have removed
the warhead.

33:53.844 --> 33:56.233
If time's not repeating
outside the launch bay...

33:56.364 --> 33:57.797
the Tholians could be close.

33:57.924 --> 34:00.882
We'd better hurry.
The red and blue conduits, right?

34:04.804 --> 34:08.001
The Cell Ships, they've been destroyed.

34:08.444 --> 34:10.196
How many?

34:11.764 --> 34:13.197
All of them.

34:14.724 --> 34:16.635
The Tholians are
on an intercept course.

34:17.764 --> 34:19.277
They're hailing us.

34:23.244 --> 34:25.121
Give us the vessel!

34:26.844 --> 34:29.438
We're preparing to surrender it to you...

34:31.043 --> 34:33.797
but our launch bay doors
took heavy damage.

34:34.043 --> 34:35.601
We're going to need more time.

34:36.043 --> 34:39.320
I have a repair team working on it,
but they estimate it will take...

34:43.563 --> 34:46.636
Two of their ships are approaching
the saucer section.

34:46.804 --> 34:49.556
80 metres, 40.

34:49.684 --> 34:51.639
They've locked onto both docking ports.

34:51.764 --> 34:54.119
Seal the hatches
and send security teams.

34:57.524 --> 34:59.754
Get to the control room.
I'll take it from here.

34:59.884 --> 35:01.158
Aye, Captain.

35:04.964 --> 35:06.920
I'm going to hold you
to that four minutes.

35:07.044 --> 35:08.397
It was only an estimate, sir.

35:10.484 --> 35:12.554
How many times
do you think we've done this?

35:12.724 --> 35:14.874
At least twice, maybe more.

35:15.044 --> 35:17.114
Let's hope we've got it down by now.

35:33.124 --> 35:35.319
They're cutting through the doors!

35:40.364 --> 35:41.592
Control room.

36:08.804 --> 36:10.203
Let's get those doors open.

36:18.564 --> 36:19.553
Now.

36:19.684 --> 36:21.481
I'd put more distance
between us and them...

36:21.604 --> 36:22.559
Now!

36:29.204 --> 36:30.603
T'Pol to Captain Archer...

36:30.764 --> 36:32.675
they've neutralised the warhead.

36:35.404 --> 36:36.803
On our way.

37:03.564 --> 37:05.919
Sir, it's gone.

37:07.684 --> 37:08.673
Gone?

37:08.844 --> 37:12.314
It dematerialised,
and it's not aboard the Tholian ships.

37:14.004 --> 37:15.403
They're disengaging.

37:25.244 --> 37:28.281
- Why didn't they fire on us?
- Good question.

37:28.444 --> 37:30.560
They may have only wanted the vessel.

37:36.364 --> 37:37.479
The Vulcans?

37:38.684 --> 37:40.481
Their warp drive is damaged.

37:40.964 --> 37:42.716
Their life support is stable.

37:43.204 --> 37:45.354
Let's see if we can give them a hand.

37:46.324 --> 37:47.552
Prep a shuttlepod.

37:48.204 --> 37:50.195
Have Dr. Phlox meet us
in Launch Bay 1.

37:50.324 --> 37:51.313
Aye, sir.

38:03.124 --> 38:05.115
Captain's Starlog, supplemental.

38:05.284 --> 38:08.356
A Vulcan transport is en route
to tow the Tal'Kir.

38:08.484 --> 38:10.759
Fortunately, there were no casualties.

38:10.964 --> 38:14.877
Our long-range scanners show no sign
of Tholians or Suliban in our vicinity.

38:15.604 --> 38:17.834
I wish we'd had more time
to explore that ship.

38:17.964 --> 38:20.034
Who knows how many other rooms
were down there.

38:20.164 --> 38:23.759
It looks like they sent the whole kit
and caboodle back to the 31st century.

38:23.884 --> 38:25.761
There's no evidence to support that.

38:26.804 --> 38:29.477
Well, there's no evidence
to contradict it, either.

38:29.684 --> 38:34.439
What I don't understand is
how quickly everything disappeared.

38:34.844 --> 38:37.074
That beacon was online
for less than a minute.

38:37.204 --> 38:39.957
You're forgetting that time is irrelevant
to these people.

38:41.444 --> 38:42.763
Irrelevant?

38:43.844 --> 38:46.119
If that vessel was from the future...

38:47.684 --> 38:51.882
whoever sent it had plenty of time
to locate the signal...

38:52.404 --> 38:55.840
and then travel back to any point in time
to retrieve it.

39:00.044 --> 39:02.763
Unfortunately, time isn't irrelevant
in my engine room.

39:02.884 --> 39:06.035
I've got repairs to finish. See you later.

39:06.204 --> 39:07.353
Subcommander.

39:16.804 --> 39:18.681
I'm going to contact
the High Command...

39:18.804 --> 39:21.557
apologise for the trouble
we caused them.

39:21.804 --> 39:26.514
As the captain of the Tal'Kir
pointed out, a ship can be replaced.

39:26.684 --> 39:29.960
I also need to thank them...

39:30.764 --> 39:32.436
for helping us out.

39:32.764 --> 39:35.039
I'm sure the gesture
would be appreciated.

39:43.444 --> 39:47.676
The High Command has asked me
to prepare a report on this incident...

39:48.404 --> 39:50.076
with your permission.

39:51.044 --> 39:52.193
By all means.

39:53.964 --> 39:55.363
I wonder...

39:55.804 --> 39:59.194
if they'll believe
that humans and Vulcans will be...

40:01.484 --> 40:03.315
swapping chromosomes one day.

40:04.164 --> 40:06.632
They're more likely to believe
in time travel.
