WEBVTT

00:00.276 --> 00:01.709
This installation is composed

00:01.744 --> 00:04.633
of Constantine's accounts
of the first Punic War

00:04.668 --> 00:07.696
- in the year 264...
- Ah, yes the first pubic war,

00:07.731 --> 00:09.532
the sexiest of all wars.

00:09.567 --> 00:11.434
Hi, Dr. Albrin Einstibe.

00:11.469 --> 00:14.148
I have an urgent question
for you about Ancient Greece.

00:14.183 --> 00:16.338
- Shall we walk?
- Of course, Doctor...

00:16.373 --> 00:17.673
I feel like you said Einstibe?

00:17.708 --> 00:19.108
Yes, that's correct, it's a family name.

00:19.143 --> 00:20.743
- What is going on?
- Captain Holt sent me.

00:20.778 --> 00:22.478
Just follow my lead.
Your theory is wrong.

00:22.513 --> 00:24.980
The Greeks did not climb out
of the Trojan Horse's butt.

00:25.015 --> 00:26.916
- Put this on.
- A rose shearing hat, at work?

00:26.951 --> 00:28.884
- People will think I'm demented.
- Just put it on.

00:28.919 --> 00:31.353
- Kevin, Dr. Einstibe.
- Ah, professor McGonagall.

00:31.388 --> 00:33.536
- Why is Boyle dressed as me?
- Shh!

00:33.571 --> 00:34.772
- Get in.
- But this cart is...

00:34.807 --> 00:36.026
Get in!

00:40.755 --> 00:42.654
- Professor.
- Student.

00:58.096 --> 01:00.063
Hello, Kevin. It's me, Raymond Holt.

01:00.098 --> 01:02.208
We need to get you to safety.
Your life is in danger.

01:16.985 --> 01:20.985

01:22.297 --> 01:24.453
Okay, so we've secured
Captain Holt's husband.

01:24.488 --> 01:25.975
Let's discuss how to proceed.

01:26.010 --> 01:28.611
So what you're saying is,
we need to talk about Kevin.

01:28.646 --> 01:30.914
I have no regrets!

01:30.949 --> 01:33.017
Kevin is currently at the
safe house with Captain Holt.

01:33.052 --> 01:34.202
How long will he have to stay there?

01:34.237 --> 01:35.978
My friend in the
Organized Crime division

01:36.013 --> 01:37.386
says they've been building a case

01:37.421 --> 01:39.588
against Seamus Murphy
for years, and they're close.

01:39.623 --> 01:41.557
They think they'll move on him
in the next month or two.

01:41.592 --> 01:43.559
So you're saying, Kevin can wait?

01:44.630 --> 01:46.996
You know what, you people are insane.
That was gold.

01:47.031 --> 01:49.765
Okay, two months in a safe
house... that's not impossible.

01:49.800 --> 01:52.474
It's nothing. I once stayed in my
apartment for 3 1/2 months straight.

01:52.509 --> 01:55.099
- Was that after they cancelled "Bunheads"?
- Why would you bring that up?

01:55.134 --> 01:57.406
I don't understand. Why can't
we just put Kevin into WITSEC?

01:57.441 --> 01:59.008
The Murphys have killed three witnesses

01:59.043 --> 02:01.043
in federal protection.
Captain doesn't wanna risk it.

02:01.078 --> 02:02.711
We'll take shifts staying with Kevin.

02:02.746 --> 02:04.713
No, it should just be me.

02:04.748 --> 02:06.481
Look, it's my fault
that Murphy's after Kevin.

02:06.516 --> 02:09.018
Captain Holt bailed me out,
and now it's my turn to bail him out.

02:09.053 --> 02:10.818
Plus we've got this whole
tit for tat thing going,

02:10.854 --> 02:12.588
and it's my time to tit.
It's my tit turn.

02:12.623 --> 02:14.390
My time to tit is today, Terry.

02:14.425 --> 02:15.958
You're gonna stay
locked up in a safe house,

02:15.993 --> 02:17.793
away from us for two months?
That's going to be brutal.

02:17.828 --> 02:20.062
- You just said it was nothing.
- Brutal for me, Gina.

02:20.097 --> 02:21.931
Relax, I'm still going to be able

02:21.966 --> 02:23.465
to text and chat with everyone.
It's not like I'm being

02:23.500 --> 02:25.935
totally shut off from the outside world.

02:25.970 --> 02:27.703
Say good-bye to the outside world.

02:27.738 --> 02:29.371
You're in the safe house now,
so I'll need your phone.

02:29.406 --> 02:31.507
- Why?
- Internet, cellular signals.

02:31.542 --> 02:33.509
- They're too easy to trace.
- Seriously, no phone?

02:33.544 --> 02:34.977
What am I supposed to do
to pass the time?

02:35.012 --> 02:36.778
You could learn a foreign language.

02:37.323 --> 02:38.614
Go to hell.

02:38.649 --> 02:40.349
The "no internet rule"
was a shock to me as well.

02:40.384 --> 02:41.717
I was hoping to salvage this time

02:41.752 --> 02:42.999
to do research on my new book.

02:43.034 --> 02:45.150
But apparently that
will not be possible.

02:45.185 --> 02:46.554
I'm sorry, it's for your own safety.

02:46.589 --> 02:48.791
Here, Peralta, let me give
you a tour of the safe house.

02:48.826 --> 02:50.626
This is the living room.

02:50.661 --> 02:52.061
- Oh.
- Stop!

02:52.096 --> 02:53.862
You're entering the zone of visibility.

02:53.897 --> 02:55.564
Someone could see you
through the windows.

02:55.599 --> 02:56.999
Why don't we just close the blinds?

02:57.034 --> 02:58.901
At mid-day? That's far too suspicious.

02:58.936 --> 03:00.836
Blinds will only be closed at night.

03:00.871 --> 03:03.672
If you must go into the living
room, crawl on your belly.

03:03.707 --> 03:04.723
Observe.

03:06.877 --> 03:08.811
Seems a little extreme.

03:09.046 --> 03:10.880
You're right, it's extreme of me to try

03:10.915 --> 03:13.224
to prevent my husband from
being shot in the face.

03:13.259 --> 03:14.950
I'm over-doing it. Kevin, come in here.

03:14.985 --> 03:16.652
- Take your bullet.
- No, fine.

03:16.687 --> 03:18.621
- We'll stay on our bellies.
- Thank you.

03:18.656 --> 03:20.789
This is one of several designated areas

03:20.824 --> 03:22.458
where you can stand
upright during the day.

03:22.493 --> 03:24.760
You can move about freely
in this square.

03:24.795 --> 03:27.663
Wow, so we have
all this room to work in?

03:27.698 --> 03:29.832
Your hand can be seen
from the living room window.

03:29.867 --> 03:31.533
- You just killed Kevin.
- Raymond...

03:31.568 --> 03:32.935
I can't hear you, Kevin. You're dead.

03:32.970 --> 03:34.536
He bled out in your lap.

03:34.571 --> 03:36.105
How will you break the news
to me? Let's see.

03:36.140 --> 03:37.906
- We don't have to do this.
- Ah, Detective Peralta,

03:37.941 --> 03:39.441
how are things going with Kevin,

03:39.476 --> 03:40.371
the love of my life?

03:40.406 --> 03:42.359
Wait, why are you here
at this late hour?

03:42.394 --> 03:43.445
And whose blood is that?

03:43.480 --> 03:44.847
- Okay, I get it.
- It's Kevin's?

03:44.882 --> 03:46.815
This is devastating. I'm inconsolable.

03:46.850 --> 03:48.861
And I've killed myself.

03:49.119 --> 03:50.653
Cool, well, I can see this is

03:50.688 --> 03:52.054
gonna be a fun couple of months.

03:52.089 --> 03:53.890
- _
- <i>Okay, we can't stream anything,</i>

03:53.925 --> 03:55.826
but I brought my DVD collection.

03:55.861 --> 03:58.496
- Do you like Nic Cage movies?
- I don't know who that is.

03:58.531 --> 04:00.599
Only the greatest and most
compelling actor of all time.

04:00.634 --> 04:02.234
What are his movies like? Describe them.

04:02.269 --> 04:04.004
Okay, well, one of them is

04:04.039 --> 04:06.841
the FBI has developed
face-swapping technology.

04:06.876 --> 04:08.139
Not interested.

04:08.174 --> 04:10.716
- There's a whole plane full of convicts.
- Nope.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.041
On the back of the original

04:12.076 --> 04:14.309
Declaration of Independence,
there's a hidden treasure map!

04:14.344 --> 04:15.878
- Stop.
- But that's the smartest one!

04:15.913 --> 04:16.849
_

04:16.884 --> 04:18.647
Oh my God, I'm so glad
Captain Holt finally agreed

04:18.682 --> 04:20.516
to let you come visit.
I missed you so much.

04:20.551 --> 04:21.771
Me too.

04:22.753 --> 04:26.188
Um... is there a way we
could get a bit more privacy?

04:27.300 --> 04:29.992
Just pretend I'm not here.
God knows I am.

04:30.027 --> 04:30.903
_

04:30.938 --> 04:32.977
Okay, I think you're actually
going to like this one.

04:33.012 --> 04:34.213
Nic Cage is a chemist...

04:34.248 --> 04:35.564
Interesting, keep going.

04:35.599 --> 04:36.932
Who has to break into Alcatraz...

04:36.967 --> 04:38.288
Absolutely not!

04:41.705 --> 04:43.238
Are there no other actors?

04:44.808 --> 04:46.390
It's Captain Holt.

04:47.111 --> 04:50.222
- Hello, Captain.
- And... you're both dead.

04:50.581 --> 04:52.381
You didn't ask for the password.

04:52.416 --> 04:54.383
What if I were an assassin

04:54.418 --> 04:56.952
wearing a hyper-realistic latex mask?

04:56.987 --> 04:59.421
Or perhaps you employed
"Face/Off" technology.

04:59.456 --> 05:00.556
- What?
- I broke down

05:00.591 --> 05:02.591
and watched one of
Peralta's action films.

05:02.626 --> 05:04.173
I'm lying, I watched them all,

05:04.208 --> 05:05.461
including one wherein a man's head

05:05.496 --> 05:06.762
turns into a flaming skull.

05:06.797 --> 05:08.611
"Ghost Rider", and "Ghost Rider 2."

05:08.646 --> 05:09.631
Both master-pie.

05:09.666 --> 05:10.999
Yes, I need your help, Raymond.

05:11.034 --> 05:12.835
Luckily, I come bearing good news.

05:12.870 --> 05:14.870
My friend in the Organized Crime unit

05:14.905 --> 05:16.872
tells me that they're moving
against Murphy tonight.

05:16.907 --> 05:18.540
- Oh, my God, really?
- You're serious?

05:18.575 --> 05:20.309
You mean to say this could be ending?

05:20.344 --> 05:21.877
Peralta, it's happening.
It's finally happening.

05:21.912 --> 05:23.912
Call everyone, we'll get
a live feed of the raid

05:23.947 --> 05:25.647
and have a viewing party.

05:25.682 --> 05:28.016
"Tie a yellow ribbon
round the old oak tree,

05:28.051 --> 05:29.718
'cause this boy's comin' home."

05:29.753 --> 05:30.803
"Con Air".

05:31.375 --> 05:32.554
What have I become?

05:32.589 --> 05:34.323
Oh, yes, people.

05:34.358 --> 05:35.958
Actual real people that aren't Kevin.

05:35.993 --> 05:37.993
- Hi, I want to touch you.
- Babe, you're being weird.

05:38.028 --> 05:39.795
Right, sorry. I forgot how to be human.

05:39.830 --> 05:41.330
- Yeah.
- Oh, Charles!

05:41.365 --> 05:42.865
- Ah.
- I need to hear your voice,

05:42.900 --> 05:44.099
Tell me what I've been
missing at the nine-nine.

05:44.134 --> 05:45.567
Ooh, Terry's grandma got really sick

05:45.602 --> 05:47.336
and had to spend a month
in the hospital.

05:47.371 --> 05:49.104
Oh... that's sad.

05:49.139 --> 05:51.573
I more meant like funny work anecdotes.

05:51.608 --> 05:52.908
Ah, Scully sat on a cherry pie

05:52.943 --> 05:54.409
and he didn't notice for six hours.

05:54.444 --> 05:56.111
The tin stayed on the whole time.

05:56.146 --> 05:57.913
Now we're talking.
Did you take a picture?

05:57.948 --> 05:59.081
Honestly, I didn't see it.

05:59.116 --> 06:00.516
I was at Terry's grandma's funeral.

06:00.551 --> 06:02.080
- Come on.
- Everyone, quiet down.

06:02.115 --> 06:04.820
The feed is live and the raid
begins in T-minus 60 seconds.

06:04.855 --> 06:06.455
In one minute, Kevin and I
will finally be able

06:06.490 --> 06:08.290
to leave this awful place.

06:08.325 --> 06:09.958
And yet we'll never
be free of the nightmares.

06:09.993 --> 06:11.760
No, those shall haunt us for always.

06:11.795 --> 06:13.629
Whoa, things got
really intense in here, huh?

06:13.664 --> 06:15.397
Oh, yeah, it got dark.
This place is a hell-mouth.

06:15.432 --> 06:16.899
- Cool.
- Shh! They're about to move.

06:16.934 --> 06:18.600
<i>- Bravo team, stand by.</i>
- I love this.

06:18.635 --> 06:20.002
I feel like Ellen watching her producers

06:20.037 --> 06:21.537
go through a haunted house.

06:21.572 --> 06:23.159
<i>- Breach, breach!</i>
- They're in.

06:23.194 --> 06:25.374
<i>- There's nobody here.</i>
- Uh-oh, the house is empty!

06:25.409 --> 06:27.309
No, no, no, no, no, no. Where's Seamus?

06:27.344 --> 06:28.577
I don't understand, what's happening?

06:28.612 --> 06:30.148
Someone must have tipped them off.

06:30.183 --> 06:32.252
The raid is a bust,
and Murphy's still at large.

06:32.287 --> 06:33.370
So what you're saying is...

06:33.405 --> 06:35.500
Everyone on the ground, immediately!

06:35.686 --> 06:37.886
Oh no, I sat in another pie.

06:37.921 --> 06:39.321
Damn it! Next time, sit on a pie

06:39.356 --> 06:41.419
when we can enjoy it, Scully.

06:41.841 --> 06:43.409
Organized Crime is hunting for Murphy,

06:43.444 --> 06:45.432
but we can't just sit back
and hope they find him.

06:45.467 --> 06:46.952
Diaz, where are you with your CI?

06:46.987 --> 06:48.854
They said Seamus' girlfriend Nikki works

06:48.889 --> 06:51.580
- in a hair salon in Bay Ridge.
- Nice, classic mistress job.

06:51.615 --> 06:53.261
Hey, my girlfriend's a hairdresser!

06:53.296 --> 06:54.877
And you cheated
on your ex-wife with her.

06:54.912 --> 06:56.318
Checkmate. Well played.

06:56.353 --> 06:57.899
Okay, Nikki won't talk to cops.

06:57.934 --> 06:59.393
So we've got to send
someone in as a customer.

06:59.428 --> 07:00.877
Get her to open up, start gossiping.

07:00.912 --> 07:03.001
Send me. I'm a gossip surgeon.

07:03.036 --> 07:04.367
I can get anything out of anyone.

07:04.402 --> 07:06.270
You can't go undercover,
you're not a cop.

07:06.305 --> 07:09.317
How am I not a cop, Terry?
'Cause I don't have a badge?

07:09.352 --> 07:12.076
- Being a cop is a state of mind.
- It's definitely not.

07:12.111 --> 07:13.316
Diaz, the mission is yours.

07:13.351 --> 07:15.685
Great. I love strangers
touching my head.

07:15.720 --> 07:17.664
Sorry, you don't
have a choice. Dismissed!

07:17.699 --> 07:19.700
Actually, Sarge, I have a lead too.

07:19.735 --> 07:21.669
I found the place that
provides shredding services

07:21.704 --> 07:24.005
for Murphy's companies.
I subpoenaed those shreds.

07:24.040 --> 07:25.341
We can piece them together.

07:25.376 --> 07:27.310
Smart. How many shreds are we talking?

07:27.345 --> 07:28.378
A few.

07:28.499 --> 07:29.683
Oh, crap.

07:30.232 --> 07:32.114
According to Organized Crime,

07:32.149 --> 07:34.117
Murphy has gone to ground,
and there are no leads.

07:34.152 --> 07:35.620
Oh, that's great. If he's on the run,

07:35.655 --> 07:36.857
he probably won't
be worrying about Kevin.

07:36.892 --> 07:39.118
And if you coat yourself
in chum and swim with sharks,

07:39.153 --> 07:40.987
you probably won't be eaten.

07:41.022 --> 07:43.316
Said the half-eaten
chum-covered swimmer.

07:43.351 --> 07:45.443
While Murphy is at large,
he's still a threat.

07:45.478 --> 07:47.411
So I'm going to be stuck here forever,

07:47.446 --> 07:48.659
following these over-the-top
security precautions?

07:48.694 --> 07:49.672
- No.
- Thank God.

07:49.707 --> 07:51.295
The security procedures
are about to become

07:51.330 --> 07:52.466
much more over-the-top.

07:52.501 --> 07:55.029
Say good-bye to your one hour
of open window time.

07:55.064 --> 07:57.999
But sir, the stench.
It needs some way to escape.

07:58.034 --> 07:59.757
I already feel as though
I'm trapped inside of...

07:59.792 --> 08:01.092
What are those things
you're always eating?

08:01.127 --> 08:02.594
- Pizza bagels? Pizza rolls?
- No. No.

08:02.629 --> 08:03.961
- Pizza poppers? Pizzaritos?
- No. No.

08:03.996 --> 08:05.329
- Pizza pockets?
- That's it.

08:05.364 --> 08:06.997
How much longer will I be forced to live

08:07.032 --> 08:08.899
- inside this pizza pocket?
- Look, I could tell you

08:08.934 --> 08:10.100
that it'll just be a few more weeks,

08:10.135 --> 08:11.535
but you don't want me to lie to you.

08:11.570 --> 08:13.471
Raymond, I beg of you. Give me two hours

08:13.506 --> 08:15.272
at the library to work
on my book... just two hours.

08:15.307 --> 08:16.679
It will make all the difference.

08:16.714 --> 08:18.079
Yeah, I could go with him,
keep him safe.

08:18.114 --> 08:20.582
No library. Seamus' men
could be lurking in the stacks.

08:20.617 --> 08:22.785
- I find that unlikely.
- I understand, but I disagree.

08:22.820 --> 08:24.955
Well then, we are in disagreement.

08:24.990 --> 08:26.718
You'll have to excuse me.

08:31.067 --> 08:33.235
I'm sorry you had to witness
such a vicious fight.

08:33.270 --> 08:35.171
- Oh, was that a fight?
- Are you kidding?

08:35.206 --> 08:38.220
He said "you'll have to excuse me"
instead of "please excuse me."

08:39.005 --> 08:41.323
Might as well have spit in my face.

08:41.599 --> 08:43.292
_

08:43.327 --> 08:45.503
Okay, first of all,
Rosa, you look amazing.

08:45.538 --> 08:47.872
Secondly, I made an
appointment at the salon

08:47.907 --> 08:49.306
with Nikki, for you, under the name

08:49.341 --> 08:51.442
Gabriella Fuentes de San Miguel Estrada.

08:51.477 --> 08:52.954
- I had fun with the name.
- Clearly.

08:52.989 --> 08:53.812
Here's the plan.

08:53.847 --> 08:56.830
Gabriella Fuentes de San Miguel
Estrada gossips about her love life.

08:56.865 --> 08:58.817
Then, Nikki opens up about hers.

08:58.852 --> 09:00.578
Yeah, this is the problem.
I suck at gossiping.

09:00.613 --> 09:02.613
Which is why I brought
along a specialist.

09:03.088 --> 09:05.923
Gina will be in your ear
feeding you stories.

09:05.958 --> 09:08.906
I will be basing Gabriella
on my sister's friend, Dana.

09:08.941 --> 09:11.709
Just be warned... Dana real sloppy.

09:11.744 --> 09:14.899
So, Nikki, I always wanted
to get my hair cut here.

09:14.934 --> 09:16.367
Everyone says you're the best.

09:16.402 --> 09:20.072
Oh, my God, I love your earrings.

09:20.107 --> 09:22.908
Where did you get those hoops?

09:22.943 --> 09:24.623
Mmm, I don't know.

09:24.658 --> 09:26.892
Oh no, Nikki's not a talker.
We're screwed.

09:26.927 --> 09:30.787
Don't worry angel, Gina's
got this, crackety-crack.

09:31.550 --> 09:34.552
Rosa, repeat after me
and don't change a thing.

09:34.587 --> 09:37.345
Can I tell you the craziest story?

09:37.380 --> 09:39.490
One time I was like so drunk...

09:39.525 --> 09:41.358
And this meathead comes up to me.

09:41.393 --> 09:43.260
And his body is hot,
but his face is like okay.

09:43.295 --> 09:45.162
So I'm like, what?

09:45.197 --> 09:47.932
And I was like, bitch,
I'm not gonna sleep with you

09:47.967 --> 09:50.334
just because you promised
to take me to the Bahamas.

09:50.369 --> 09:52.002
Take me to the Bahamas first

09:52.037 --> 09:53.767
and then we'll see what happens, okay?

09:53.802 --> 09:57.174
I was only with him
because he drove a Jaguar.

09:57.209 --> 09:58.576
Turns out it was a Mercury

09:58.611 --> 10:00.477
with a Thundercat taped to the hood.

10:00.512 --> 10:02.851
And that relationship
lasted for three months.

10:02.886 --> 10:05.499
I don't know why we broke up.
I guess we just grew apart

10:05.534 --> 10:07.070
when he went to prison for life.

10:07.384 --> 10:08.567
I hear that.

10:09.831 --> 10:12.733
The guy I'm seeing
is into some shady stuff.

10:12.768 --> 10:13.926
Right?

10:13.961 --> 10:16.529
There it is, the breakthrough.
Follow up, follow up!

10:16.895 --> 10:18.085
So, how'd you guys meet?

10:18.120 --> 10:21.140
That's a funny story, for next time.

10:21.843 --> 10:23.434
You're all done, and you look hot, girl.

10:23.469 --> 10:24.657
<i>No, no, she was opening up.</i>

10:24.692 --> 10:26.659
Rosa, figure out a way
to stay in that chair.

10:27.104 --> 10:30.056
Hey, Nikki, I was just wondering.

10:30.091 --> 10:31.777
How do you think I would look...

10:32.837 --> 10:34.203
as a blonde?

10:34.380 --> 10:36.513
Like a Danielle Steele novel.

10:37.050 --> 10:40.552
Good oranges, nice and dry.
Not at all ripe.

10:40.672 --> 10:43.206
Fascinating.
My orange is beginning to rot.

10:43.555 --> 10:44.989
That happens when you leave an orange

10:45.024 --> 10:46.457
sitting around for too long

10:46.492 --> 10:48.525
and refuse to even let that
orange go to a library

10:48.560 --> 10:50.527
for two hours so it can feel
like a real orange again.

10:50.562 --> 10:52.491
You know what really
causes an orange to go bad?

10:52.526 --> 10:54.208
Getting shot.
Have you seen what a bullet

10:54.243 --> 10:55.577
does to an orange?

10:55.612 --> 10:57.418
I shot a watermelon once.

10:58.337 --> 11:00.337
It's exactly what you want it to be.

11:00.372 --> 11:02.373
- I miss Amy.
- You think I enjoy doing this?

11:02.408 --> 11:04.141
I assure you, I do not.

11:04.176 --> 11:05.763
I'm simply trying
to keep my husband alive.

11:05.798 --> 11:08.200
Well, you may not have a husband
when all of this is over.

11:08.235 --> 11:09.835
You're not going to die, Kevin.

11:10.082 --> 11:11.518
That's not what I meant.

11:14.020 --> 11:16.789
I'm leaving.
This is an absurd conversation,

11:16.824 --> 11:18.332
and you're being ridiculous.

11:24.263 --> 11:27.398
You know what, screw this.
We need a break.

11:27.433 --> 11:29.566
I'm a cop, I can protect us.
We're going to the library.

11:29.601 --> 11:31.717
These two oranges are stepping out.

11:32.037 --> 11:34.604
Oh, damn it, peeling out.
It was right there!

11:35.437 --> 11:37.437
Okay, Captain Holt has
back-to-back meetings

11:37.472 --> 11:38.873
at One Police Plaza today,

11:38.908 --> 11:40.207
which means we have a four-hour window

11:40.242 --> 11:42.031
before he checks on any
of the security feeds.

11:42.066 --> 11:44.042
But going out into public
is a huge risk,

11:44.077 --> 11:46.512
so maybe let's go over some
self-defense techniques.

11:48.715 --> 11:51.125
Usually, you warn somebody
before you do that.

11:51.160 --> 11:53.195
Raymond told me that the element
of surprise was crucial.

11:53.230 --> 11:54.499
Cool.

11:54.534 --> 11:56.936
So he's a great teacher.
But I will say this.

11:56.971 --> 11:58.229
If you're going to do a throat punch,

11:58.264 --> 12:01.669
it is key that you say something cool
afterwards like, "choke on that."

12:01.704 --> 12:04.219
But they're not choking.
They're experiencing airway trauma.

12:04.254 --> 12:05.445
Ooh, how about,

12:05.480 --> 12:08.330
"Better get some corticosteroids
to treat that laryngeal fracture."

12:08.365 --> 12:09.900
Okay, yeah, that's very informative

12:09.935 --> 12:11.300
and quite polite.

12:11.335 --> 12:13.516
But maybe add a "dirtbag" on the end?

12:13.551 --> 12:15.133
But a dirtbag is a
useful part of a vacuum.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.792
I don't see how it's an insult.

12:16.827 --> 12:18.110
All right, you know, puncher's choice.

12:18.145 --> 12:20.093
Moving on, we're going
to need disguises.

12:20.128 --> 12:22.077
And since we're going
to a public library,

12:22.112 --> 12:23.315
the best way to fit in is as...

12:23.350 --> 12:24.984
- Scholars.
- Weird perverts.

12:25.019 --> 12:26.940
Yes, weird perverts is far better.

12:26.975 --> 12:27.986
Far better.

12:40.862 --> 12:43.750
What is the bandwidth on the wifi here?

12:43.785 --> 12:46.653
We have much content to stream.

12:48.475 --> 12:51.643
Bam! Solid match.
Okay, I've got three words.

12:51.678 --> 12:54.709
I've got an "and",
I've got an "an" and a "he".

12:54.745 --> 12:56.809
Now, the "he" could be a part of a "the"

12:56.845 --> 12:58.807
or the end of "Apache."

12:58.893 --> 13:01.785
I don't know why, but I'm
getting a strong "Apache" vibe.

13:01.934 --> 13:04.089
Amy? Amy?

13:04.389 --> 13:06.823
- Amy, where'd you go?
- Down here.

13:07.839 --> 13:09.570
I let the pile take me.

13:09.688 --> 13:11.095
I don't know what I was thinking.

13:11.261 --> 13:12.560
We've been at it for two hours

13:12.596 --> 13:14.496
and all we've got is three words.

13:14.532 --> 13:17.033
Really two.
Terry's just fooling himself.

13:17.209 --> 13:18.946
"Apache's" a long shot at best.

13:18.982 --> 13:20.839
Ooh, are you guys building a nap nest?

13:20.875 --> 13:22.308
- Mind if we burrow?
- No!

13:22.344 --> 13:23.609
We're piecing together
shredded documents

13:23.644 --> 13:25.845
- to find Seamus Murphy.
- Can I help?

13:25.881 --> 13:28.380
I'm really good at jigsaw puzzles.
I do them all the time.

13:28.415 --> 13:30.778
It's why my wrist muscles
are so defined.

13:30.814 --> 13:32.931
No offense, Scully,
but you can't be good or bad

13:32.967 --> 13:34.233
at jigsaw puzzles.

13:34.269 --> 13:36.321
It's just putting shapes together.

13:36.356 --> 13:39.554
There's no strategy
or reasoning, or logic...

13:39.590 --> 13:42.460
Look, I got half a page!

13:43.157 --> 13:44.613
He is the one.

13:44.649 --> 13:46.867
This is great. There's nobody here.

13:46.903 --> 13:48.694
Everyone cleared out
as soon as we got here.

13:48.900 --> 13:51.134
Even that actual pervert
was creeped out by us.

13:52.172 --> 13:54.672
I can feel your heat.

13:56.343 --> 13:58.677
Ooh! No offense, but it feels
so good to breathe air

13:58.712 --> 14:00.345
that didn't come out of your mouth.

14:00.380 --> 14:02.533
- None taken.
- Ooh, I know you're working,

14:02.569 --> 14:04.449
but you should probably put
something on your screen perverted

14:04.485 --> 14:06.185
in case someone comes in

14:06.221 --> 14:08.086
like a lady in high heels
stepping on a businessman.

14:08.188 --> 14:09.488
Sorry, yes, I meant to do that.

14:09.523 --> 14:11.189
I've just gotten so
wrapped up in my research.

14:11.225 --> 14:12.825
I've been reading
the most thrilling footnote.

14:15.937 --> 14:17.443
- What was that?
- I don't know.

14:17.479 --> 14:19.031
But don't worry...

14:19.472 --> 14:21.972
I'll creep them
right the hell out of here.

14:22.694 --> 14:26.658
Hello... who's sneaking
around back here?

14:26.725 --> 14:28.189
Bang, you're dead. And so is Kevin.

14:28.247 --> 14:29.355
Oh, thank God, it's just you.

14:29.391 --> 14:30.982
Wait, no, this is bad
in a different way.

14:31.018 --> 14:32.144
What are you doing?

14:32.179 --> 14:33.612
You brought my husband
to a public place?

14:33.648 --> 14:36.031
He's undercover. We're perverts, see?

14:36.067 --> 14:37.500
You're not fooling anyone.

14:37.536 --> 14:38.850
Kevin's zipper is up, for God's sake.

14:38.885 --> 14:41.620
Wait, I'm confused... how did
you even know we were here?

14:42.298 --> 14:44.832
Oh, my God, you sewed a tracker
into my neck, didn't you?

14:44.868 --> 14:46.261
Don't be stupid.

14:46.297 --> 14:48.334
The trackers are in your shoes,
underwear, and wallet.

14:48.370 --> 14:49.734
I also braided one into your hair.

14:49.770 --> 14:50.852
In my tangle?

14:50.888 --> 14:53.077
You put my husband at risk,
and for what?

14:53.113 --> 14:54.691
Because you felt a little cooped up?

14:54.727 --> 14:55.676
That's not it.

14:55.712 --> 14:58.303
- You could have cost him his life.
- What life, Raymond?

14:58.339 --> 15:00.868
I spend every day lying
on the floor of that house

15:00.904 --> 15:03.492
talking with Jake about popular culture.

15:03.528 --> 15:05.838
Do you know what it means
to "clap back", Raymond?

15:05.874 --> 15:07.346
Be-cause-I-do.

15:07.381 --> 15:09.181
Enough. We have to get back
to the safe house immediately.

15:09.216 --> 15:12.286
Let's go. And if you're
gonna be a pervert, Kevin,

15:12.322 --> 15:13.755
adjust yourself as you walk.

15:13.791 --> 15:15.754
Move some quarters
around in your pocket.

15:15.789 --> 15:18.326
So I used to see my
boyfriend on Friday nights

15:18.362 --> 15:19.837
after his wife went to bed,

15:19.873 --> 15:21.938
but then he left town
a couple of weeks ago.

15:22.462 --> 15:23.795
You're all done here, gorgeous.

15:23.830 --> 15:27.532
Ahhhh-ha-ha, I love it!

15:27.634 --> 15:29.301
But finish what you were saying.

15:29.336 --> 15:30.702
Where'd your boyfriend run off to?

15:30.804 --> 15:33.472
Oh, that's a story for next time.

15:33.507 --> 15:35.208
Rosa, we're so close, you can't leave.

15:35.244 --> 15:38.184
Tell her you want a perm. I want a perm.

15:38.220 --> 15:39.587
A big ol' perm.

15:39.861 --> 15:41.113
Great idea.

15:43.583 --> 15:46.084
_

15:48.018 --> 15:52.289
_

15:55.262 --> 15:58.430
_

16:01.640 --> 16:04.301
_

16:08.590 --> 16:12.793
_

16:18.289 --> 16:20.231
_

16:22.751 --> 16:25.068
_

16:25.104 --> 16:28.185
_

16:40.407 --> 16:42.340
Go, go, go!

16:44.971 --> 16:46.437
Take a seat.

16:51.293 --> 16:52.992
I can't believe someone took Raymond.

16:53.028 --> 16:54.285
He had a gun, Jake.

16:54.321 --> 16:55.760
It'll be okay. We're gonna get him back.

16:55.796 --> 16:57.556
Let me just call the nine-nine.

16:58.552 --> 17:01.259
Hey, Rosa, do you guys have any
idea where Seamus Murphy is?

17:01.295 --> 17:02.527
We have a huge problem.

17:02.563 --> 17:04.296
Yeah, we all have huge problems.

17:04.332 --> 17:06.465
You kinda look like Phil
Spector when he was on trial.

17:06.502 --> 17:08.569
Guys, focus up. Have you found anything?

17:08.605 --> 17:10.451
One of Murphy's guys just took Holt.

17:10.487 --> 17:12.287
Oh, no. We did get something from Nikki.

17:12.321 --> 17:14.323
Apparently, Seamus has been staying up

17:14.358 --> 17:16.324
- in Rhinebeck, New York.
- Rhinebeck?

17:16.426 --> 17:18.394
Scully, where's that piece of junk mail

17:18.429 --> 17:19.661
with the Rhinebeck address?

17:19.695 --> 17:22.097
- Scully, surface!
- Yes, Sarge?

17:22.132 --> 17:24.266
- Rhinebeck letter.
- One sec.

17:28.847 --> 17:32.092
- 8221 Oak Ridge Parkway.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

17:32.128 --> 17:33.928
All right, we're going
to commandeer a car,

17:33.964 --> 17:35.402
and then we're going
to drive to Rhinebeck.

17:35.438 --> 17:38.411
No one is going to hurt
your husband... this I swear.

17:39.015 --> 17:41.682
Ow, owie, owie, owie, it stings, ow!

17:41.718 --> 17:44.601
Oh, ho, ho. Follow me.

17:47.424 --> 17:48.657
Hello, Raymond.

17:48.692 --> 17:50.259
So Seamus, are you going to kill me?

17:50.294 --> 17:52.361
No, don't be stupid, nothing like that.

17:52.396 --> 17:53.899
I'm just going to find your husband,

17:53.935 --> 17:55.468
bring him here, slit his throat
in front of you,

17:55.504 --> 17:58.569
then, after you watch
him suffer, kill you too.

18:00.737 --> 18:03.946
- There it is... 8221.
- All right, let's go.

18:03.982 --> 18:05.515
What? No, you're not coming in.

18:05.553 --> 18:06.904
It's way too dangerous for a civilian.

18:06.940 --> 18:08.210
You're driving back to the safe house

18:08.245 --> 18:09.778
and watching another Nic Cage movie.

18:09.813 --> 18:11.713
You still haven't seen
"Gone in 60 Seconds."

18:11.748 --> 18:13.649
His character's name is
Memphis Raines. I'm so sorry.

18:13.684 --> 18:16.218
No, I'm not abandoning
my husband. I love him.

18:16.253 --> 18:18.320
Yeah, I love him too.
Everybody loves Raymond.

18:18.355 --> 18:20.155
- Don't.
- I think that's pretty funny!

18:20.191 --> 18:21.357
- No.
- It doesn't matter.

18:21.458 --> 18:23.982
You got to go. Get the hell
out of here, I got this.

18:34.838 --> 18:36.012
Sir!

18:38.141 --> 18:39.474
Hey there.

18:42.379 --> 18:44.546
- Where is Kevin?
- Don't worry, he's safe.

18:44.648 --> 18:47.649
Look, Captain, I just want
to say that I'm sorry.

18:47.684 --> 18:49.384
You should be.

18:49.431 --> 18:51.432
You should have abided
by my security rules.

18:51.522 --> 18:53.322
You're right. But I want you to know,

18:53.357 --> 18:54.556
I didn't take Kevin to the library

18:54.591 --> 18:56.625
because I was stir-crazy.

18:56.660 --> 18:58.695
It was because I didn't want
you guys to get divorced.

18:58.731 --> 19:00.933
How is that any concern of yours?

19:00.969 --> 19:02.330
I don't know, I just...

19:02.432 --> 19:04.833
I've been around so many
failed marriages in my life.

19:04.868 --> 19:07.236
You know, first my mom and my dad,

19:07.271 --> 19:10.105
then Charles and Eleanor,
Hitchcock and Brandi,

19:10.140 --> 19:13.141
Hitchcock and Francine,
Hitchcock and Brandi again,

19:13.243 --> 19:15.344
- Hitchcock and Madison...
- Madison wasn't his daughter?

19:15.379 --> 19:17.112
But he dropped her off
at college last fall.

19:17.147 --> 19:19.348
I know, it was really gross.
But the point is,

19:19.383 --> 19:21.896
I just couldn't stand
to see you two fall apart.

19:22.842 --> 19:24.185
Perhaps I should have been
more understanding

19:24.221 --> 19:26.065
of what Kevin was going through.

19:26.947 --> 19:28.872
I may die here tonight,

19:28.908 --> 19:31.527
and his last memory of me will
be how miserable I made him.

19:31.562 --> 19:35.363
So, Peralta, what do
you have to say for yourself?

19:35.465 --> 19:36.798
The whole NYPD knows where you are,

19:36.900 --> 19:38.700
and they're coming for you right now.

19:38.735 --> 19:40.602
Okay, thanks for the tip.

19:40.637 --> 19:42.370
Let's kill them both, get out
of here before the cops come.

19:42.406 --> 19:44.128
Wait, no, no, no,
I was lying about the back-up.

19:44.164 --> 19:45.798
I came alone... title of my sex tape.

19:45.834 --> 19:49.006
Doesn't matter.
You're both gonna die now.

19:56.564 --> 19:57.863
Better get some corticosteroids

19:57.899 --> 19:59.632
to treat that laryngeal fracture.

19:59.668 --> 20:01.523
Sorry, I couldn't bring myself
to call him a dirtbag.

20:01.559 --> 20:03.292
And why would you?
A dirtbag is a very useful part

20:03.328 --> 20:05.562
of the vacuum cleaner.
Clearly, it's a compliment.

20:05.729 --> 20:08.463
Wow, you guys
are so perfect for each other.

20:08.498 --> 20:10.732
<i>Oh, my garsh!</i>

20:10.767 --> 20:13.914
It's all the same. Nothing has changed.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.948
- Except for that.
- This perm saved your life.

20:16.984 --> 20:18.507
And I thank it for its service.

20:19.245 --> 20:21.376
Hello, Captain. Hello, Kevin.

20:21.411 --> 20:23.595
So, here's an update on Seamus.

20:23.631 --> 20:25.431
Thanks to our little operation,

20:25.467 --> 20:28.660
the FBI was able to roll up
his entire organization.

20:28.696 --> 20:30.018
They're saying it's going to be

20:30.054 --> 20:32.613
one of the most significant RICO
prosecutions they've ever done.

20:32.649 --> 20:34.168
- Amazing.
- It's over now.

20:34.204 --> 20:37.225
He can't hurt me or Kevin.
Thank you, for titting my tat.

20:37.260 --> 20:39.124
Well, thank you for tatting my tit.

20:39.160 --> 20:40.526
And you know, in a weird way,

20:40.562 --> 20:41.726
I'm going to miss our little house.

20:41.762 --> 20:43.131
Yes, and in an even weirder way,

20:43.166 --> 20:45.167
I think I might actually miss you.

20:45.358 --> 20:48.626
And in an even weirder way,
I want you guys to be my dads.

20:48.662 --> 20:50.672
- That is weirder.
- Yeah, I got stuff.

20:50.707 --> 20:52.140
I brought you your box of DVDs.

20:52.175 --> 20:54.012
Oh, thank you.

20:54.444 --> 20:56.396
Oh! Forgot about this one.

20:56.432 --> 20:58.766
We never watched
"Captain Corelli's Mandolin."

20:58.802 --> 21:00.482
What the hell did you just say?

21:00.892 --> 21:03.893
- "Captain Corelli's Mandolin"?
- Say that to my face.

21:04.058 --> 21:05.253
"Captain Corelli's Mandolin"?

21:05.288 --> 21:06.655
There was a movie about a mandolin,

21:06.690 --> 21:08.423
and you kept it from me for two months?

21:08.458 --> 21:09.758
Well I didn't think it was any good.

21:09.793 --> 21:11.126
- It's just some period piece.
- What?

21:11.161 --> 21:12.361
- Set in Greece.
- Oh, my God.

21:12.396 --> 21:14.137
Based on some dumb book. Aah!

21:14.398 --> 21:17.963
Terribly sorry. It has
been a very trying time.

21:17.999 --> 21:19.532
Yeah, next thing, you're
going to say you'd wished

21:19.568 --> 21:20.835
we had watched "Leaving Las Vegas,"

21:20.871 --> 21:22.137
a dark, ponderous
reflection on alcoholism

21:22.172 --> 21:23.405
that earned Cage his Oscar.

21:23.440 --> 21:26.208
- Aah!
- What?

21:26.243 --> 21:27.842
I told you, the guy's got range!
