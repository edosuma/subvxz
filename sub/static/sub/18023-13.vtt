He has his own
sales methods.

a buyer an idiot.

01:45.522 --> 01:47.231

come back around?

01:47.273 --> 01:49.983
>> Like seven years
later, we finally got back in.

01:50.026 --> 01:51.401
>> But he came back.

01:51.444 --> 01:52.945

asked a customer if

01:52.987 --> 01:54.321
her wore a tupe.

01:54.364 --> 01:56.615
Or showing up to a
meeting soaking wet.

01:56.658 --> 01:59.409
You don't call buyers idiots.
>> Well he was.

01:59.452 --> 02:00.702
>> That's why I
don't want you to say a word.

15:23.505 --> 15:25.798
>> Look, Jep ain't

15:25.841 --> 15:28.843
That s the reason I
should be I-C-E-O

15:28.886 --> 15:32.680
>> Ya ll need to
decide which one it is.

15:32.723 --> 15:33.973
>> That ain t it.

15:34.016 --> 15:35.183
>> You re opening shipped
containers already.

15:35.225 --> 15:36.351
>> That ain t it,
that s closed.

15:36.393 --> 15:38.144
Look, trust me when

15:38.187 --> 15:44.984
I got bros in all

15:45.027 --> 15:46.569
>> Ya ll opened everything

15:46.612 --> 15:48.029
>> I think this it.

15:48.072 --> 15:49.405
>> This is it!
>> Is that it?

15:49.448 --> 15:50.782
>> This is it.
>> That s it.

15:50.824 --> 15:52.116
>> Are you sure?
>> Yeah, that s it.

15:52.159 --> 15:53.326
>> I hope that s it.
>> This is it.

15:53.369 --> 15:56.454
>> What the crap?

15:56.497 --> 15:58.081

15:58.123 --> 15:59.207
[reading]

15:59.249 --> 16:00.583
>>" Willie, we d love
to talk to you about

16:00.626 --> 16:02.669

16:02.711 --> 16:05.171
Until then, please enjoy
these complementary

16:05.214 --> 16:08.383
custom golf tees."
Boo-yeah!

16:08.425 --> 16:11.719
>> Jep, you wasted
all day on stupid golf tees.

16:11.762 --> 16:15.098
>> Yes. The I-C-E-O
saves the day once again.

16:15.140 --> 16:16.349
>> Case closed!

16:16.392 --> 16:17.433
>> What do ya ll
want me to do with all

16:17.476 --> 16:19.060
these packages now?

16:19.103 --> 16:20.603
>> Do you mind re-
packaging them for us?

16:20.646 --> 16:23.189
>> Yeah, it-
>> Thank you Stinky!

16:23.232 --> 16:25.733
>> Thank you, Stinky!
We re so sorry.

16:25.776 --> 16:30.321
>> I m sorry, for being
the best I-C-E-O ever!

16:30.364 --> 16:38.329
[turkey noises]
>> This is it.

16:38.372 --> 16:41.082
>> This doesn t look
like an office.

16:41.125 --> 16:42.917
>> Jase we ain t
taking that turkey in

16:42.960 --> 16:44.419
this house I can
tell you that right now.

16:44.461 --> 16:45.962
>> What are you
talking about?

16:46.005 --> 16:47.672
>> I thought it was
going to be somewhere

16:47.715 --> 16:49.841
he could hose off,
not in his living room.

16:49.883 --> 16:51.217
>> Bad idea.

16:51.260 --> 16:52.969
>> Hey, stick with
the script son.

16:53.012 --> 16:56.347
>> Sales gimmicks
definitely have their

16:56.390 --> 16:58.057
place, but that place
is not the living room

16:58.100 --> 17:00.560
of a multi-million
dollar mansion.

17:00.602 --> 17:01.769
>> Stand right there.

17:01.812 --> 17:03.104
When he opens the
door don t move because

17:03.147 --> 17:04.439
I don t want him
seeing that turkey.

17:04.481 --> 17:06.482
Actually I ll just
kind of walk in half way.

17:06.525 --> 17:07.400
[knocking]

17:07.443 --> 17:09.527
Hello Ty!
What s going on?

17:09.570 --> 17:11.195
Oh no, no.
Stay seated no

17:11.238 --> 17:12.405
need to get up!

17:12.448 --> 17:14.490
I m rolling the dice as
it is just by having

17:14.533 --> 17:15.908
Jase here at all.

17:15.951 --> 17:18.369
There s no way I m
taking that turkey tornado

17:18.412 --> 17:20.329
into this guy s house!

17:20.372 --> 17:23.708
>> This place is awesome, wow!
>> Well thank you.

17:23.751 --> 17:25.334
How s business
for you guys?

17:25.377 --> 17:26.419
>> Oh man it s good.

17:26.462 --> 17:27.670
We uh, you know
we ve been making

17:27.713 --> 17:28.963
some Turkey calls.

17:29.006 --> 17:30.882
We got the,
the strut commander.

17:30.924 --> 17:32.675
>> Yeah, yeah.
Jase what about you,

17:32.718 --> 17:33.676
what you been doing?

17:33.719 --> 17:37.388
[turkey noise]
I see.

17:37.431 --> 17:40.600
[turkey noise]
>> So look!

17:40.642 --> 17:42.143
We ve got some box
calls, we got the mouth

17:42.186 --> 17:45.772
calls which Jase
has been chirping on there.

17:45.814 --> 17:48.024
They re super good,
we ve tested them out.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.401
I know it s a new
product but you know

17:50.444 --> 17:51.903
we re coming off
the duck commander

17:51.945 --> 17:53.905
brand which we know
tried and true.

17:53.947 --> 17:54.989
>> Right, right.

17:55.032 --> 17:56.491
>> And um we think
it s going to be a

17:56.533 --> 17:57.575
good venture, so.

17:57.618 --> 17:59.285
I m doing this one
by the book,

17:59.328 --> 18:01.996
sell him on the product,
sell him on us,

18:02.039 --> 18:03.414
collect the money.

18:03.457 --> 18:05.249
>> Well I d like
to start off a little

18:05.292 --> 18:07.085
conservatively
if I could.

18:07.127 --> 18:10.922
Start with 500 of each.

18:10.964 --> 18:12.590
>> Oh that s great,
we can start-

18:12.633 --> 18:13.716
that s a good-
that s a good

18:13.759 --> 18:14.759
way to start.

18:14.802 --> 18:15.760
>> That s how
it s done kids!

18:15.803 --> 18:17.720
All that s left is
the paperwork.

18:17.763 --> 18:20.014
>> No I- I just
think that s kind of low.

18:20.057 --> 18:21.641
You know?

18:21.683 --> 18:24.143
>> And the part where
Jase talks back to

18:24.186 --> 18:26.354
the customer and
endangers the whole deal.

18:26.396 --> 18:29.190
Jase that s not low-
that s a good, 500.

18:29.233 --> 18:32.318
>> If you saw these
things work on real

18:32.361 --> 18:35.238
live turkeys, I guarantee
you it would change

18:35.280 --> 18:36.405
your opinion.

18:36.448 --> 18:37.448
>> That is a good idea.

18:37.491 --> 18:38.574
>> Next week we
could go hunting.

18:38.617 --> 18:40.535
>> I actually have
a live turkey in the

18:40.577 --> 18:42.787
back of Willie s truck.

18:42.830 --> 18:46.541
>> No way.
Turkey in your truck?

18:46.583 --> 18:47.959
>> Well we were-
>> I d love to see it!

18:48.001 --> 18:49.210
>> I ll be right back.

18:49.253 --> 18:51.796
>> Well I didn t want
to bring a turkey in

18:51.839 --> 18:53.089
your house I m not sure-

18:53.132 --> 18:55.466
>> It s okay I don t mind,
I d like to see it.

18:55.509 --> 18:56.551
>> It s like a real turkey.

18:56.593 --> 18:57.677
>> Look, I want to
see if they work!

18:57.719 --> 18:59.262
>> It s a real
turkey I mean it s like-

18:59.304 --> 19:01.013
>> I understand,
that s all good.

19:01.056 --> 19:02.932
>> I don t know what
this guy s definition

19:02.975 --> 19:05.726
of good is, but I m
fairly confident that

19:05.769 --> 19:08.146
whatever s about
to happen, ain t it.

19:08.188 --> 19:09.480
>> Oh goodness!

19:09.523 --> 19:10.731
>> I told you it s
a real turkey.

19:10.774 --> 19:12.233
>> It is a real turkey.
>> How crazy is that?

19:12.276 --> 19:13.234
>> Awesome!

19:13.277 --> 19:14.527
>> I just don t
want to turn stuff

19:14.570 --> 19:17.655
up because he s hard
to get back in the cage.

19:17.698 --> 19:20.116
I swear if that
stupid bird destroys

19:20.159 --> 19:21.534
this guys house and
blows our sale, both

19:21.577 --> 19:24.370
he and Jase are
riding home in that cage.

19:24.413 --> 19:26.038
[turkey noises]

19:26.081 --> 19:28.499
>> Oh yeah, there we go.
Here we go.

19:28.542 --> 19:30.543
[turkey noises]

19:30.586 --> 19:34.088
>> It s exciting
isn t it.

19:34.131 --> 19:35.381
>> I don t think he s
doing anything.

19:35.424 --> 19:38.593
>> Of course a little
enthusiasm would be nice.

19:38.635 --> 19:47.643
Wide call s working.
Anything at all.

19:47.686 --> 19:50.479
>> Turkey looks like it
might not be feeling well.

19:50.522 --> 19:52.356
>> No, that turkey s fine.

19:52.399 --> 19:55.151
Just take a step to
let us know you re not dead.

19:55.194 --> 19:59.280
Here he comes.
Here he comes.

19:59.323 --> 20:01.824
[turkey noises]

20:01.867 --> 20:03.034
Family s good,
everything s good?

20:03.076 --> 20:04.118
>> Just go ahead
and write this up

20:04.161 --> 20:06.078
for 250 a piece.
>> 250 a piece, okay.

20:06.121 --> 20:07.371
>> 250 a piece.

20:07.414 --> 20:09.540
>> So we, I thought
we said, I could ve

20:09.583 --> 20:11.083
swore we said 500
each but maybe-

20:11.126 --> 20:12.418
>> Oh!

20:12.461 --> 20:13.461
>> So do you want to do
the paper work in here.

20:13.503 --> 20:14.545
>> I ve got a little
office in there

20:14.588 --> 20:15.630
we can go do it.

20:15.672 --> 20:17.298
>> Cool let s go yeah
let s go, yeah.

20:17.341 --> 20:18.674
Probably should have
done this to start with.

20:18.717 --> 20:20.760
Just right off the
bat we probably should

20:20.802 --> 20:21.886
have just sat down.

20:21.929 --> 20:23.387
>> Hang on I m
telling you something s

20:23.430 --> 20:24.388
going to happen.

20:24.431 --> 20:25.431
>> Jase!
Jase I think it s over.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.016
Got to know when
to say when, bro.

20:27.059 --> 20:30.436
>> All right let s pray.

20:30.479 --> 20:32.647
Father we re so
thankful for all the

20:32.689 --> 20:33.773
many things you ve
given us.

20:33.815 --> 20:34.941
Father thank you
for our business

20:34.983 --> 20:37.318
thank you for this
family, and we just

20:37.361 --> 20:39.320
pray that you continue
to bless us through Jesus

20:39.363 --> 20:40.863
we pray, amen.

20:40.906 --> 20:42.031
[all together]
>> Amen!

20:42.074 --> 20:43.532
>> Let s get on that
turkey! Gobble gobble.

20:43.575 --> 20:46.244
>> Life is full of
opportunities, and I ve

20:46.286 --> 20:47.745
learned, that it s
what you do with those

20:47.788 --> 20:50.206
opportunities that
defines you as a person.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.916
Whether you re
temporarily filling

20:51.959 --> 20:54.126
in at the office,
or stuck looking

20:54.169 --> 20:56.003
like a turkey at
a sales meeting,

20:56.046 --> 20:58.673
what s most important,
is that you try your best

20:58.715 --> 20:59.799
and learn from
your mistakes.

20:59.841 --> 21:02.009
While opportunities
can sometimes be

21:02.052 --> 21:03.844
overwhelming, take
comfort in the fact

21:03.887 --> 21:06.180
that your family will
always be there

21:06.223 --> 21:08.849
to support you, unless
they bring a wild turkey.

21:08.892 --> 21:11.602
In that case, everything s
uncomfortable.

21:11.645 --> 21:14.355
>> This turkey is
delicious!

21:14.398 --> 21:15.147
>> Well, atleast the turkey
did something right.
