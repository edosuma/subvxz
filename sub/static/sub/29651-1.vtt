[narrator]<i> Once upon a time</i>
<i> in the land of Kandis,</i>

01:00.194 --> 01:01.760
<i> a princess named Carlotta</i>

01:01.762 --> 01:05.464
<i> saved a herd of horses</i>
<i> from plunging over a cliff,</i>

01:05.466 --> 01:08.384
<i>but just as the horses stopped,</i>

01:08.385 --> 01:11.303
<i> the edge of the cliff</i>
<i> gave way, and Carlotta fell.</i>

01:11.305 --> 01:13.772
<i> When she awoke,</i>
<i> she found to her astonishment</i>

01:13.774 --> 01:16.542
<i> that she could understand</i>
<i> what the horses were saying.</i>

01:16.544 --> 01:21.547
<i> It was a gift, a reward</i>
<i> for her bravery and kindness.</i>

01:21.549 --> 01:24.817
<i> Back at her castle,</i>
<i> Carlotta wrote a magical book</i>

01:24.819 --> 01:27.753
<i> and through this book,</i>
<i> the talking gift passed</i>

01:27.755 --> 01:32.124
<i> to future generations,</i>
<i> but Carlotta added a warning.</i>

01:32.126 --> 01:36.128
<i> The book must never be lost,</i>
<i> for if it were,</i>

01:36.130 --> 01:41.333
<i> the gift itself would</i>
<i> be lost... forever.</i>

Catch up, Valentine!

03:09.290 --> 03:11.590
And you, Xaver.

03:11.592 --> 03:12.824
Hurry up, Joan.

[birds tweeting]

03:34.315 --> 03:36.682
-[Emmy] You know, Caesar.
-[Caesar] Mm?

03:36.684 --> 03:39.251
Whatever we do, it just feels
like you always let me win...

03:39.253 --> 03:40.603
[Caesar laughs]

03:40.604 --> 03:41.954
...it's not fair and
it's boring.

03:41.956 --> 03:43.655
What are you moaning about?

03:44.525 --> 03:46.325
I thought you liked winning.

03:46.327 --> 03:48.660
But if the rest of
you don't try,

03:48.662 --> 03:50.829
it doesn't count. [laughs]

03:50.831 --> 03:51.997
You're a princess, Emmy.

03:51.999 --> 03:53.999
We're supposed to let you win.

03:54.001 --> 03:56.935
You should treat me
just like any other girl.

03:56.937 --> 04:00.239
Of course, a girl
like any other.

04:00.241 --> 04:02.774
Who just happens to
wear a crown?

04:02.776 --> 04:04.476
And lives in a huge
gigantic castle?

04:04.478 --> 04:06.845
-With servants and...
-So, from now on

04:06.847 --> 04:08.013
we're allowed to beat ya?

04:08.015 --> 04:09.465
[laughs]

04:09.466 --> 04:10.916
And you promise not to whine
like humans

04:10.918 --> 04:12.317
usually do when they lose?

04:12.319 --> 04:14.319
I'm losing, I'm losing.

04:14.321 --> 04:16.888
That sounds absolutely
nothing like--

04:16.890 --> 04:18.323
-[screams]
-[thud]

04:18.325 --> 04:20.526
Ouch.

04:20.527 --> 04:22.728
Black flip with a double twist.
Very fancy.

04:22.730 --> 04:25.330
I'll double twist you.

04:25.332 --> 04:29.268
No, no tickling! [laughs]

04:29.270 --> 04:32.037
Right then, let's have a
real challenge

04:32.039 --> 04:34.973
and we'll see who the
whiny babies are.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.575
Super, count me in.

04:36.577 --> 04:40.479
-Last one back's a donkey.
-[horses cheer]

04:40.481 --> 04:42.881
Wait, that's cheating!

04:45.586 --> 04:47.452
Come on, Caesar.

04:51.659 --> 04:53.292
Ha ha.

04:53.594 --> 04:54.726
Caesar.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.430
This isn't fair.

04:59.500 --> 05:00.866
Well, I could do it this way.

05:00.868 --> 05:02.734
Or is this any good?

05:02.736 --> 05:05.704
-[laughs]
-Bad Caesar, bad horse.

05:05.706 --> 05:06.772
Whoa!

05:06.774 --> 05:10.909
-[people chattering]
-[camera clicks]

05:10.911 --> 05:12.844
[woman] Real excitement
and a tremendous sense

05:12.846 --> 05:15.547
of anticipation here as
Professor Croupe

05:15.549 --> 05:17.983
prepares to read the parchment
to the waiting crowd.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.785
For years we debated the origins

05:19.787 --> 05:22.454
of this ancient parchment.

05:22.456 --> 05:25.824
Was it really a page from
Carlotta's book?

05:25.826 --> 05:27.959
Or merely some trifle
from the past

05:27.961 --> 05:31.697
written in some
long-forgotten strange tongue.

05:31.699 --> 05:34.700
My friends, we now
have the answer,

05:34.702 --> 05:37.769
for last night, under
cover of darkness,

05:37.771 --> 05:43.508
the parchment underwent a most
remarkable transformation.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.844
Uh... which as you will see--

05:45.846 --> 05:48.847
Huh? It's gone, the
page is gone!

06:19.446 --> 06:20.612
Hmm.

06:26.854 --> 06:28.120
Huh? [gasps]

06:32.626 --> 06:33.658
Hmm.

06:37.131 --> 06:38.163
David?

06:38.932 --> 06:41.133
Gizana? Gizana!

06:41.135 --> 06:44.469
Wouldn't this be perfect
for the Princess Day Ball?

06:44.471 --> 06:46.738
-It's lovely.
-Now hurry up and try it on.

06:48.776 --> 06:49.841
Hmm.

06:57.684 --> 06:59.785
[grunts]

07:01.422 --> 07:03.054
[grunts]

07:03.056 --> 07:06.591
Hello, your highness,
so glad you could join us.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.727
I'd have got here sooner
if it wasn't for certain

07:08.729 --> 07:09.561
horses cheating.

07:09.563 --> 07:10.862
Who, us?

07:10.864 --> 07:14.099
Not you. Caesar.

07:14.101 --> 07:16.568
I may not have run my fastest,

07:16.570 --> 07:18.703
but then you did say we
should treat you

07:18.705 --> 07:20.639
just like any other girl.

07:20.641 --> 07:22.674
Oh, I see.

07:22.676 --> 07:24.576
It's a conspiracy.

07:24.578 --> 07:26.144
You wanted to hear me whine.

07:26.146 --> 07:27.145
-[bell dings]
-Shh.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.016
-Hi, guys.
-[Emmy] David!

07:31.018 --> 07:32.851
Where've you been all day?

07:32.853 --> 07:34.619
Up in the mountains.

07:34.621 --> 07:37.055
And I'd have been first back
if Caesar hadn't cheated.

07:37.057 --> 07:38.457
Wouldn't I?

07:38.459 --> 07:41.026
[blows raspberry]

07:42.062 --> 07:44.529
[laughs]

07:44.531 --> 07:46.498
They don't seem to agree.

07:46.500 --> 07:49.634
Who are you gonna believe?
Me or them?

07:49.636 --> 07:52.737
Anyway, shouldn't
you be at work?

07:52.739 --> 07:55.640
I would be, if this hadn't
practically landed on my head.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.809
[gasps] The page from
Carlotta's book?

07:57.811 --> 07:59.845
-You didn't steal it, did you?
-Course not.

07:59.847 --> 08:02.614
I'm simply returning it
to its rightful--

08:02.616 --> 08:03.748
-Oh.
-[gasps]

08:04.251 --> 08:06.785
Whoa, that's weird.

08:06.787 --> 08:08.520
[David] Totally.

08:08.522 --> 08:09.821
I'm glad to be rid of it.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.757
Well, I've got work to do.

08:12.759 --> 08:15.694
Oh, by the way, I just
saw your cousin in town.

08:15.696 --> 08:17.762

08:42.589 --> 08:45.624

really is weird.

08:45.626 --> 08:46.658
Hmm.

08:48.161 --> 08:49.661
-[gasps]
-What is it?

[gasps]

09:03.110 --> 09:04.142
Huh?

09:06.313 --> 09:08.013
You know, back when
I was in the military--

09:08.015 --> 09:09.047
[Ceasar] Hey, shh.

09:09.917 --> 09:10.949
Where's Emmy?

09:11.618 --> 09:12.951

[Carlotta]<i> Emmy, pass the test</i>

09:53.060 --> 09:56.595

10:05.706 --> 10:07.672
[high swoosh]

10:11.244 --> 10:13.712
Do they mean the talking gift?

10:13.714 --> 10:17.315
I thought I could only lose it
if I lost Carlotta's book.

10:17.317 --> 10:20.051
I'd go and take a look
at that book if I was you.

10:20.053 --> 10:21.086
Very close look.

[Emmy] Well, I guess this shows

11:22.082 --> 11:24.182
us how to get
there, hey, horsey?

11:24.184 --> 11:28.420
I'll go tomorrow, which means
we have to get up early.

11:28.422 --> 11:30.155
Very early.

[alarm beeps]

-What about?
-Zip.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.240
Hmm, brothers.

11:50.277 --> 11:52.310
Mom, what's this all about?

11:52.312 --> 11:53.912
I'm in a hurry.

11:53.914 --> 11:54.913
Mom?

11:56.049 --> 11:58.116
Dad, have you seen Mom?

muffins again.

Mom.

Mom.

12:12.565 --> 12:15.032
Sweetheart, do you know
what this room is?

12:15.035 --> 12:18.002
Clean? Empty?

12:18.004 --> 12:19.904
Yes, for now.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.841
But in ten days' time,
this will be your stage.

12:22.843 --> 12:24.809
A stage for my little princess

12:24.811 --> 12:27.512
to finally make her
debut in society.

12:27.514 --> 12:29.347
-The Princess Day Ball.
-Hmm?

12:30.851 --> 12:33.384
The Council of Elders have asked
us to hold it here in

12:33.386 --> 12:34.486
the castle this year.

12:34.488 --> 12:36.221
And you've been invited, Emmy.

12:36.223 --> 12:39.057
Your first ever
Princess Day Ball.

12:39.059 --> 12:40.925
Oh, what?

12:40.927 --> 12:43.061
[chuckles] You'd better
start preparing.

12:43.063 --> 12:45.363
Remember, you only have
ten days to get ready.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.165
And we have a surprise for you.

12:48.168 --> 12:49.467
What do you think?

12:51.138 --> 12:53.071
-Whoa.
-[dramatic music]

12:56.810 --> 12:58.009
It's beautiful.

12:58.011 --> 13:00.111
You're not dreaming, go on.

13:00.113 --> 13:03.481
Wow, my dress. My
Princess Day dress.

13:04.851 --> 13:06.417
Oh, Mom, that's so wonderful.

13:07.521 --> 13:12.857
But, um, but please, I
have to be going.

13:12.859 --> 13:14.159
Aren't you excited?

13:15.228 --> 13:17.362
I really am, but I've got
ten days, right?

13:17.364 --> 13:19.998
-That's loads of time.
-Oh, no.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.368
The time will just fly by with

13:23.370 --> 13:26.171
-Frau Zwickelmeier.
-Frau Zwickelmeier?

13:26.173 --> 13:29.374
Moritz, stop it, it's
gonna be wonderful.

13:29.376 --> 13:31.509
Oh, there she is.

13:31.511 --> 13:33.244
What a happy day!

13:33.246 --> 13:36.514
Oh, I can't wait to see
you in that dress!

13:36.516 --> 13:38.516
Ah, young lady, aren't
you wondering

13:38.518 --> 13:40.185
who your Master of
Manners will be?

13:40.187 --> 13:42.153
You mean you?

13:42.155 --> 13:44.889
[scoffs] No, I excel
at many things.

13:44.891 --> 13:48.326
Ooh, oops, not least baking.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.261
But etiquette isn't one of them.

13:50.263 --> 13:51.963
You'll receive your instruction

13:51.965 --> 13:55.033
from Vincenzo
Massimo Cerimonata.

13:55.035 --> 13:57.101
-[Karl] Muffin anyone?
-Maybe later.

13:57.103 --> 13:59.404
Uh, I've just brushed my teeth.

13:59.406 --> 14:00.939
Really?

14:00.941 --> 14:02.273
Can I please leave now?

14:02.275 --> 14:04.442
-I have to--
-Not so fast.

14:04.444 --> 14:07.212
You have to pass certain tests
before attending the ball.

14:07.214 --> 14:10.048
[Karl] Prove you're posh enough.
[laughs]

14:10.050 --> 14:12.183
Well, we wouldn't want
to let the side down.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.352
No, not in front of all
those la-di-das

14:14.354 --> 14:15.420
from the other kingdoms.

14:15.422 --> 14:17.355
And if I don't pass?

14:18.091 --> 14:19.390
Of course you'll pass.

14:19.392 --> 14:21.626
You're an
exceptional young lady.

14:21.628 --> 14:24.028
Really? You really think so?

14:24.030 --> 14:27.899
Yes, absolutely. Now,
let's celebrate with a muffin.

14:27.901 --> 14:29.467
Oh, I uh, I've got this thing

14:29.469 --> 14:31.269
I have to do, I'll be back soon.

14:31.271 --> 14:33.238
-What thing?
-I'll tell ya later.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.073
-Ah, whoa.
-Sorry.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.575
-Emmy.
-Won't be long!

14:37.577 --> 14:39.177
Yeah!

14:39.179 --> 14:40.879
[panting]

14:43.583 --> 14:45.049
-[knocking]
-Sorry!

14:45.051 --> 14:47.952
[man] Huh?<i> Attenzione. Atten--</i>

14:47.954 --> 14:50.889
-Whoa!
-[cat meows]

14:50.891 --> 14:51.890

14:51.892 --> 14:52.357
[cat purrs]

14:53.226 --> 14:54.425
[speaks in foreign language]

14:54.427 --> 14:57.161
Sebastian, can I
saddle up Caesar?

14:57.163 --> 14:58.897
He's all yours, Emmy!

14:58.899 --> 15:00.965
Emmy? The<i> Principessa?</i>

15:00.967 --> 15:02.267
[speaks in foreign language]

15:02.269 --> 15:04.235
There's something else I
need to tell you.

15:04.237 --> 15:07.572
[Emmy] Tell me later. Love you,
Mom!

15:07.574 --> 15:09.040
<i> -La Mama?</i>
-[Karla] My goodness,

15:09.042 --> 15:10.308
what happened?

15:10.309 --> 15:11.575
Please, let me help you.

15:11.578 --> 15:15.280
Your majesty, Vincenzo
Massimo Cerimonata.

15:15.282 --> 15:17.415
Welcome,<i> Senor</i> Cerimonata.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.684
I am most humbly at your
service, ma'am.

15:19.686 --> 15:23.388
Please do come in
and please accept my apologies.

15:23.390 --> 15:25.290
Emmy's terribly excited.

15:25.292 --> 15:27.425
Oh, I'm sure Mr. Vincenzo knows

15:27.427 --> 15:30.194
what naughty little
monkeys children are.

15:30.196 --> 15:32.397
He does, and he will
do his utmost

15:32.399 --> 15:35.033
to make this child a lady.

15:35.035 --> 15:38.169
Oh, your highness,
you are a cook.

15:38.171 --> 15:39.370
Amateur.

15:39.372 --> 15:41.039
Advanced amateur.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.340
Uh... Please, take one.

15:42.342 --> 15:45.443
Oh, Mr. Vincenzo,
let me show you to your room.

15:45.445 --> 15:48.646
Whoa. Look at that,
didn't spill a crumb.

15:48.648 --> 15:50.348
Did you see that, Mr...

15:50.350 --> 15:53.318
Please, let me show
this young man to his room.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.787
Thank you, Fionnuala.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.255
[Fionnuala] You'll be sleeping
in our finest guest room.

15:58.258 --> 16:01.059
Madam, I expected no less.

16:01.728 --> 16:04.128
My name's Fionnuala, by the way.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.130
You think Emmy's ready
for the Princess Day Ball?

16:06.132 --> 16:08.299
For the Ball, yes.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.201
For Mr. Outstanding,

16:10.203 --> 16:12.403
-I have my royal doubts.
-[laughs] Karl. Shh. Don't.

16:12.405 --> 16:13.738
[Fionnuala] And if
there's anything you need,

16:13.740 --> 16:15.573
you just let me know.

16:15.575 --> 16:18.343
And we have a ghost, you know.

16:18.345 --> 16:20.378
Right here in the castle.

16:20.380 --> 16:22.380
[speaks in foreign language]

16:22.382 --> 16:24.248
[Fionnuala] That lot don't
believe in it,

16:24.250 --> 16:26.217
but I've seen things.

16:27.754 --> 16:30.621
[soft music]

16:30.623 --> 16:32.690
[birds squawk]

16:47.407 --> 16:49.374
[gasps]

16:49.376 --> 16:52.343
I think we've found
what you're looking for.

16:52.345 --> 16:56.681
-[Caesar neighs]
-Steady, boy, steady.

16:56.683 --> 16:57.782
[gasps]

17:01.287 --> 17:03.788
[bird squawks]

17:03.790 --> 17:06.524
[Caesar] This test
the voices talked about...

17:06.526 --> 17:09.427
you reckon you'll
discover what it is?

17:09.429 --> 17:10.628
Up there?

17:12.699 --> 17:15.066
Only one way to find out.

17:15.068 --> 17:17.769
Xaver, you're in charge
while we're gone.

17:17.771 --> 17:19.670
Let's move, hop hop.

17:21.741 --> 17:23.808
-[horse neighs]
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:23.810 --> 17:26.077
We haven't discussed
tactics yet.

17:26.079 --> 17:27.245
Plans, plan Bs.

17:27.247 --> 17:28.613
You know, when I was
in the army--

17:28.615 --> 17:31.382
-Please, Xaver.
-Do give it a rest.

17:31.384 --> 17:34.685
Fine, don't blame me when
the whole thing goes belly up.

17:36.322 --> 17:39.590
[dramatic music]

17:57.544 --> 17:59.177
Hmm.

18:06.719 --> 18:08.286
Whoa.

18:23.369 --> 18:25.403
-[high tinkle]
-Whoa.

18:26.506 --> 18:29.774
[Caesar] Amazing. Wow.

18:32.645 --> 18:35.513
[inspirational music]

18:40.587 --> 18:41.819
Come on.

18:57.137 --> 19:00.738
[horse hooves clatter]

19:12.852 --> 19:14.418
Whoa.

19:34.374 --> 19:40.411
-[high whine]
-[horses whinny]

19:40.413 --> 19:43.648
[dramatic music]

19:47.520 --> 19:51.822
-[gasps]
-[Carlotta]<i> Who are you?</i>

19:51.824 --> 19:55.393
I'm Emmy, I've come
about the test.

19:59.432 --> 20:01.766
[Carlotta]<i> Who are you?</i>

20:05.305 --> 20:07.772
<i> Are you worthy of the gift?</i>

20:21.554 --> 20:26.891
-[slow music]
-[horse hooves clatter]

20:39.005 --> 20:40.404
Emmy?

20:40.406 --> 20:41.539
It's getting late.

20:56.322 --> 20:59.290
[Carlotta]<i> Are you worthy?</i>

21:05.298 --> 21:08.366
-[bells tinkle]
-[cars rumble]

21:11.504 --> 21:14.839
-[horn blares]
-[birds cry]

21:18.511 --> 21:20.544
[David] Are you
worthy of the gift?

21:21.914 --> 21:25.349
I didn't know what to say.
How should I know if I'm worthy?

21:25.351 --> 21:27.985
Well, we know there's
gonna be some kind of test.

21:27.987 --> 21:30.388
Maybe it's the
Princess Day Ball.

21:30.390 --> 21:32.723
Don't you have to pass
a bunch of silly tests

21:32.725 --> 21:33.891
before they even let you go?

21:33.893 --> 21:35.693
If you do lose the
talking gift--

21:35.695 --> 21:38.362
not that you will, obviously,
but if you did--

21:38.364 --> 21:39.630
can I have it?

21:39.632 --> 21:43.567
-Ha ha, very funny.
-No. [laughs]

21:46.839 --> 21:50.441
Moritz, put that
skateboard away!

21:50.443 --> 21:53.511
[Karl sighs]
That thing's an absolute menace.

21:53.513 --> 21:55.379
[Fionnuala] Moritz!

21:56.416 --> 21:57.848
[grunts]

22:01.988 --> 22:05.823
Horsey, if this test
is the Princess Day Ball,

22:05.825 --> 22:08.526
I reckon it's in the bag.

22:09.829 --> 22:13.998
-[car rumbles]
-[horn blares]

22:14.000 --> 22:16.967
[tires screech]

22:19.372 --> 22:23.474
[upbeat music]

22:23.476 --> 22:25.576
[tuts]

22:25.578 --> 22:27.111
Hello, Frau Zwickelmeier.

22:27.113 --> 22:29.413
Maurice, did I teach
you nothing?

22:29.415 --> 22:31.415
Chin up, up, up.

22:31.417 --> 22:33.050
One's head is always kept high.

22:33.052 --> 22:35.553
And when you did you last
have a haircut?

22:35.555 --> 22:37.421
Ask your parents to
invest in one

22:37.423 --> 22:38.989
as a matter or urgency.

22:38.991 --> 22:41.659
Would you close the door
behind me, please, Maurice?

22:41.661 --> 22:43.861
-It's Moritz.
-Hello?

22:43.863 --> 22:46.664
Frau Zwickelmeier has arrived.

22:46.666 --> 22:49.467
Princess Emmy? Hello?

22:49.469 --> 22:52.903
Would the princess
be in the ballroom perhaps?

22:52.905 --> 22:56.741
Can someone please help me
find the<i> Kleine Prinzessin?</i>

22:58.678 --> 23:00.778
Is somebody going somewhere?

23:00.780 --> 23:02.747
-That's what I wanted
to tell you.

23:02.749 --> 23:04.432
-Hmm.

23:04.433 --> 23:06.116
We're going to have a
house guest.

23:06.119 --> 23:08.052
A house guest?

23:08.054 --> 23:10.454
She's up in your room
as we speak.

23:10.456 --> 23:12.757
Your cousin, Gizana.

23:12.759 --> 23:15.726
[dramatic music]

23:17.530 --> 23:20.631
[growls]

23:21.634 --> 23:22.600
[gasps]

23:25.071 --> 23:28.706
Hello, Emmy, I'm just
throwing out some trash.

23:28.708 --> 23:30.408
What trash?

23:30.410 --> 23:32.610
My dear cousin, as far
as I can see,

23:32.612 --> 23:35.880
it's all trash, but I
couldn't throw it all out,

23:35.882 --> 23:38.082
so I started with
the baby trash.

23:40.586 --> 23:42.019
What?

23:42.020 --> 23:43.453
This is my room,
it's none of your business.

23:43.456 --> 23:47.124
Well, it is my business
if it's cluttering up my bed.

23:47.126 --> 23:50.060
-That's my bed.
-It was, till I got here.

23:50.062 --> 23:52.897
Guests come first,
and that's how it's gonna be

23:52.899 --> 23:54.498
until the Ball.

23:54.500 --> 23:55.599
What?

23:55.601 --> 23:57.201
We're sharing the Ball now too.

23:57.203 --> 23:59.637
If you can pass all
your classes of course.

23:59.639 --> 24:02.673
Shame really. Squeezing you
into this tiny room,

24:02.675 --> 24:06.010
when there's such
a beautiful big one upstairs.

24:06.012 --> 24:09.814
-Show me.
-If you insist.

24:09.816 --> 24:11.182
Take me there.

24:12.652 --> 24:14.952
[Emmy] Ta-da!

24:14.954 --> 24:18.189
Look, your new room.

24:18.191 --> 24:19.723
Charming, huh?

24:19.725 --> 24:21.725
And spacious.

24:21.727 --> 24:23.661
It certainly is.

24:23.663 --> 24:26.130
[Gizana] I'm surprised you
haven't taken it yourself.

24:26.132 --> 24:27.898
[Emmy] Let's talk straight,
shall we?

24:27.900 --> 24:29.133
Absolutely.

24:29.135 --> 24:31.168
I can't stop you being here,

24:31.170 --> 24:33.170
but you'd better keep
your distance.

24:33.172 --> 24:35.973
And what distance would that be?

24:35.975 --> 24:37.074
This far?

24:38.544 --> 24:39.710
How about now?

24:40.913 --> 24:42.746
Just say when.

24:42.748 --> 24:44.815
[sighs]

24:44.817 --> 24:48.619
-So you brought me to an arena.
-What?

24:48.621 --> 24:52.022
A battlefield with
winners and losers.

24:52.024 --> 24:54.091
Are you testing me?

24:54.093 --> 24:56.994
[chuckles] Please,
you wouldn't stand a chance.

24:56.996 --> 24:58.529
Don't bet on it.

24:58.531 --> 24:59.697
No?

25:00.600 --> 25:01.632
[screams]

25:01.634 --> 25:03.634
[gasps]

25:08.541 --> 25:10.358
Ta-da.

25:10.359 --> 25:12.176
Girls, what's wrong?
What happened?

25:12.178 --> 25:15.145
And what on Earth are you
doing up here anyway?

25:15.147 --> 25:17.047
Emmy just showed me my new room.

25:17.049 --> 25:19.500
[Karla] Emmy.

25:19.501 --> 25:21.952
I thought she'd enjoy
the extra space.

25:21.954 --> 25:23.087
This is no time for jokes.

25:23.089 --> 25:25.689
Gizana, maybe you can explain.

25:25.691 --> 25:28.225
It was a shock to me, too,
Auntie.

25:28.227 --> 25:31.595
The Princess Emmy has a point,
<i> senora.</i>

25:31.597 --> 25:35.566
Look at it, the room is
practically royal.

25:35.568 --> 25:38.102
In fact, I think Emmy
should have it herself

25:38.104 --> 25:40.738
as a reward for her generosity.

25:40.740 --> 25:43.874
[Karla] I think that's a
very good idea.

25:43.876 --> 25:45.910
You can move your things
in after dance class.

25:45.912 --> 25:50.614
Which begins in
approximately ten minutes ago.

25:50.616 --> 25:52.983
-But, Mom...
-[Karla] Emmy.

25:52.985 --> 25:54.785
I'm going, I'm going.

25:54.787 --> 25:57.254
[cat meows]

25:58.190 --> 25:59.189
[groans]

25:59.191 --> 26:02.192
[panting]

26:02.962 --> 26:04.862
Emmy, what happened?

26:04.864 --> 26:07.197
[Emmy] I've got a new room.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.234
[Zwickelmeier] Ah-ha, at last.

26:10.236 --> 26:11.669
<i> Entre, entre.</i>

26:11.671 --> 26:14.305
What is this, a
frightened rabbit?

26:14.307 --> 26:17.207
A princess strides
into the room.

26:17.209 --> 26:18.709
Yes, Frau Zwickelmeier.

26:18.711 --> 26:20.611
So, down to work.

26:20.613 --> 26:22.646
All dancing starts
with counting.

26:22.648 --> 26:25.883
It might seem odd, but one
who cannot count, cannot dance.

26:25.885 --> 26:27.952
So, are we ready?

26:27.954 --> 26:29.186
Yes, I am.

26:29.188 --> 26:31.088
We begin with the waltz.

26:31.090 --> 26:33.290
One, two, three, one, two,
three.

26:33.292 --> 26:35.759
Together, one, two, three.

26:35.761 --> 26:37.928
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

26:37.930 --> 26:39.330
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

26:39.332 --> 26:40.598
-One, two, three.
-[Zwickelmeier] OK,

26:40.600 --> 26:42.299
stop, stop, stop.

26:42.301 --> 26:45.302
The goal, my dear Princess,
is to shine

26:45.304 --> 26:48.639
on this most important day
of a young lady's life.

26:48.641 --> 26:51.609
To reach that goal, we
must be consistent,

26:51.611 --> 26:54.678
focused, and never, ever
lose sight of it.

26:54.680 --> 26:58.282
One should sleep,
breathe, and-- ah, a mouse.

26:58.284 --> 27:00.117
[screams]

27:01.087 --> 27:04.655
[screams]

27:04.657 --> 27:06.991
[cat meows, howls]

27:06.993 --> 27:09.660
-Emmy!
-Emmy!

27:09.662 --> 27:11.228
-What now?
-[Karla] Emmy!

27:12.798 --> 27:14.064
[screams]

27:14.066 --> 27:16.300
It's a ghost, it's
coming for me!

27:16.302 --> 27:20.104
It's coming for-- Emmy, kill it!

27:20.106 --> 27:25.409
-Here, mousey, here.
-[screams]

27:26.879 --> 27:28.812
Mousey, come here.

27:28.814 --> 27:31.215
Emmy, help me, Emmy.

27:31.217 --> 27:33.250
-Emmy.
-No, Rockfried!

27:35.287 --> 27:40.124
[screams, gasps]

27:40.126 --> 27:42.960
That's it, end of classes.

27:42.962 --> 27:45.929
Frau Zwickelmeier goes home.

27:45.931 --> 27:50.434
So long, farewell,
<i> auf wiedersehen,</i> and good-bye.

27:50.436 --> 27:53.203
[Karla] Frau Zwickelmeier,
Frau Zwickelmeier?

27:53.205 --> 27:54.738
-Please don't leave.
-Frau Zwickelmeier.

27:54.740 --> 27:56.674
Could you at least tells
us what happened?

27:59.378 --> 28:02.079
I have no appetite for
explanations.

28:02.081 --> 28:03.914
You shall go directly
to your room

28:03.916 --> 28:07.017
and reflect on your
egregious behavior.

28:07.019 --> 28:09.253
You know I can rescind
your invitation

28:09.255 --> 28:11.855
to the ball at anytime I choose,
yes?

28:11.857 --> 28:13.791
Do you doubt I would do it?

28:13.793 --> 28:17.227
-I didn't hear you.
-No, Mr. Cerimonata.

28:17.229 --> 28:18.228
<i> Bene.</i>

28:18.230 --> 28:19.229
You heard him, Emmy.

28:19.231 --> 28:22.332
Off to your, uh, new room.

28:22.334 --> 28:23.934
Yes, Dad.

28:25.805 --> 28:29.339
[panting] Princess Emmy,
what happened?

28:29.341 --> 28:31.775
They let me out of
dance class early.

28:31.777 --> 28:34.945
[sighs]

28:40.052 --> 28:41.085
David?

28:41.954 --> 28:44.021
We were wrong about the test.

28:44.023 --> 28:46.457
I don't think it is the ball.

28:46.459 --> 28:48.392
I think it's Gizana.

28:49.128 --> 28:51.261
Well, think about it.

28:51.263 --> 28:55.032
Since she arrived,
everything's gone wrong.

28:55.034 --> 28:57.968
So it's a test to see if you can
put up with your horrible cousin

28:57.970 --> 28:59.369
without going bananas?

28:59.371 --> 29:00.270
Exactly.

29:01.507 --> 29:05.375
And I'm not at all sure
that's a test I can pass.

29:05.377 --> 29:08.178
Of course I won't do
anything silly.

29:08.180 --> 29:11.248
I will, I promise.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.951
You too, bye.

29:15.087 --> 29:16.053
Hmm.

29:16.756 --> 29:18.822
Little Miss Perfect.

29:22.094 --> 29:24.394
Two for you, two for Emmy.

29:24.396 --> 29:26.396
Share and share alike.

29:26.398 --> 29:28.398
I'll make sure she gets them.

29:28.400 --> 29:30.934
-[Vincenzo] Ah, Gizana.
-[gasps]

29:30.936 --> 29:33.070
We have a very busy
day tomorrow.

29:33.072 --> 29:36.406
I expect you both downstairs
at 6:30 on the dot.

29:36.408 --> 29:37.941
Yes, Mr. Vincenzo.

29:37.943 --> 29:39.877
And be sure to tell your cousin.

29:39.879 --> 29:42.780
<i> Senor</i> Vincenzo
does not tolerate tardiness.

29:42.782 --> 29:44.948
Oh, I'll make sure she knows.

30:23.989 --> 30:26.557
Princess Emmy, I made it clear

30:26.559 --> 30:29.059
-we begin at 6:30 sharp.
-[yawns]

30:29.061 --> 30:32.229
You must be washed,
dressed and ready to go.

30:32.231 --> 30:34.565
-But nobody told--
-Before the final note

30:34.567 --> 30:36.166
-of the bugle is played.
-[chuckles]

30:36.168 --> 30:39.336
So... are you gonna stand
there all day?

30:39.338 --> 30:43.407
You have three minutes
to get ready, beginning now.

30:43.409 --> 30:44.908
[laughs]

30:44.910 --> 30:48.111
-Tappy toe.
-The time is ticking.

30:48.113 --> 30:51.215
[panting]

30:51.217 --> 30:53.116
-Ready.
<i> -Bene.</i>

30:54.587 --> 30:57.254
Three, two, one, we
start with balance.

31:06.265 --> 31:09.266

<i> is nothing to smile about.</i>

31:09.268 --> 31:13.136

<i> your every move a work of art.</i>

31:33.292 --> 31:34.258
[whistles]

31:34.260 --> 31:36.894
Art class starts at 2:30 sharp.

31:36.896 --> 31:38.962
Anybody want a muffin?

31:38.964 --> 31:44.067
Excellent idea, Your Majesty,
let us have a short break.

-Xaver, Valentine, Donny.
-Shh!

[Emmy] What's Daphne doing here?

32:04.256 --> 32:06.690
-[horses whinny]
-[Gizana] You know

32:06.692 --> 32:09.476
my dream, Emmy?

32:09.477 --> 32:12.261
To be the most perfect princess
in the entire world.

32:12.264 --> 32:15.098
And I think I can be.

32:15.100 --> 32:17.267
I think I have what it takes.

32:17.269 --> 32:19.002
What about you, Emmy?

32:20.572 --> 32:22.406
Do you have what it takes?

32:23.409 --> 32:26.076
Do you even know what it takes?

-Hmm.
-[horses neigh]

32:30.616 --> 32:32.015

her broomstick.

32:34.186 --> 32:36.420
[Daphne]
She isn't always like that.

32:36.422 --> 32:37.688
So you're on her side, are ya?

32:37.690 --> 32:40.257
Maybe you're a little
miss perfect, too.

32:40.259 --> 32:42.326
We didn't think much
of little miss perfects

32:42.328 --> 32:45.095
-in the army.
-[Rose] Oi, knock it off.

32:45.097 --> 32:46.997
Rose is right, guys.

32:46.999 --> 32:48.532
This isn't Daphne's fault,

32:48.534 --> 32:50.600
she's just sticking up
for her mistress.

32:50.602 --> 32:54.972
I'm not being funny or anything,
but did that human just talk?

32:54.974 --> 32:57.240
Uh, yes. Yes, she did.

32:57.242 --> 32:59.476
-Some kind of trick, right?
-No trick.

32:59.478 --> 33:01.712
And she understands what we say?

33:01.714 --> 33:03.647
That's pretty much how it works.

-Hello.
-Oh, my days.

33:33.412 --> 33:35.012

33:35.014 --> 33:37.247
Some fabulous little secret?

it's a joke, Emmy.

Not me.

Whoa, that was close.

34:09.181 --> 34:10.547
[Emmy] Very close.

A little over the top there,

34:13.152 --> 34:16.420

34:16.422 --> 34:18.188
It's like flowers.

Violets.

got a little discombobulated.

35:14.613 --> 35:15.745
Shall I biff him one?

35:16.715 --> 35:20.383
Whoa, and mess up my

do need a comb.

on my wig again?

35:28.660 --> 35:30.660
Who are you?

35:30.662 --> 35:33.230

The girl who isn't looking
after a certain secret book.

found it yet.

38:28.807 --> 38:30.640
Can I have it back, please?

38:30.642 --> 38:32.642
So, a storybook is
more important

This isn't some

39:55.861 --> 39:57.560
[Emmy] Ouch.

39:57.562 --> 39:59.095
Oh, my goodness, are
you all right?

39:59.097 --> 40:01.464
Nothing broken, nothing broken.

40:01.466 --> 40:02.899
It's just a little sprain.

40:02.901 --> 40:03.900
[Karl] Fionnuala's ointment?

40:03.902 --> 40:05.769
Yep, looks like it.

40:05.771 --> 40:08.638
Emmy's getting the ointment,
Emmy's getting

40:08.640 --> 40:10.573
-the ointment.
-[Emmy] No way.

40:10.575 --> 40:12.175
[laughs] Fionnuala's ointment.

40:12.177 --> 40:15.145
[speaks in foreign language]

40:15.147 --> 40:16.980
[clears throat]

40:16.981 --> 40:18.814
[Fionnuala] The ointment
has a singular aroma.

40:18.817 --> 40:20.483
No,<i> grazie.</i>

40:20.485 --> 40:22.152
But it's not at all unpleasant.

40:22.154 --> 40:26.456
Oh, you all think
you're so smart.

40:26.458 --> 40:29.025
Mark my words, when it's
fixing they need,

40:29.027 --> 40:31.094
it's Fionnuala's
ointment they ask for.

40:31.096 --> 40:33.113
Hmm?

40:33.114 --> 40:35.131
[Fionnuala] There we go.
Nice and thick.

40:35.133 --> 40:36.699
You'll be thanking me
in the morning.

40:36.701 --> 40:38.535
-[cat screeches]
-You always do.

40:38.537 --> 40:41.171
[groans]

40:41.173 --> 40:44.874
-[grunts]
-Not another one.

40:46.845 --> 40:48.178
[cat meows, purrs]

40:48.180 --> 40:51.748
Right, chaps, you know the
drill. [laughs]

40:51.750 --> 40:54.551
-[horses neigh]
-Fionnuala's wonder cream.

40:54.553 --> 40:56.486
[Karl] One, two, hup.

40:57.489 --> 40:59.088
There we go.

40:59.090 --> 41:02.592
-Oops, watch out for the door.
-[growls]

41:02.594 --> 41:04.461
Now, let's go and see
about that book.

41:04.463 --> 41:08.164
[Fionnuala] Perfect, you'll
be good as new in no time.

41:08.166 --> 41:11.968
Now you rest here while I go
check on that silly man.

41:11.970 --> 41:14.737
-Mr. Vincenzo?
-Ouch.

41:37.262 --> 41:39.829

41:39.831 --> 41:41.598
Huh?

41:41.600 --> 41:42.799
[nasal voice]
No, no, Rockfried,

41:42.801 --> 41:43.933
you stay here.

42:01.853 --> 42:04.521
Temperature? [gasps]

42:04.523 --> 42:05.955
High.

42:05.957 --> 42:08.725
Let's hope he's forgotten
all about this in the morning.

42:08.727 --> 42:11.694
Otherwise he might just
cancel Emmy's invitation.

42:11.696 --> 42:13.763
[Karla] Or even the entire ball.

42:13.765 --> 42:15.932
[gasps]

42:15.934 --> 42:17.567
Listen here, Emmy!

42:17.569 --> 42:19.068
If the ball gets canceled
because of you,

42:19.070 --> 42:20.036
I'm going to--

42:21.039 --> 42:22.071
Hmm?

42:30.215 --> 42:31.814
[grunts]

42:44.296 --> 42:45.795
[normal voice] So, my

42:45.797 --> 42:48.298
sneaky little cousin
does have a secret.

42:48.300 --> 42:50.867
[sniffs]

42:50.869 --> 42:52.769
[Xaver] Excellent bandage work.

42:52.771 --> 42:54.004
You know, when I was

42:54.005 --> 42:55.238
in the Queen's Own Royal
Dragoons,

42:55.240 --> 42:57.106
-we used to make--
-Not now, Xaver.

42:57.108 --> 42:59.909
It's not my foot I'm
worried about.

42:59.911 --> 43:02.845
Vincenzo's got Carlotta's book.

43:02.847 --> 43:05.782
I said it was a bunch
of old children's stories,

43:05.784 --> 43:07.617
but what if he loses it?

43:07.619 --> 43:10.253
What if he throws it out?

43:10.255 --> 43:14.157
You know what happens
if I lose that book, Caesar.

43:14.159 --> 43:16.192
I'd lose the gift.

43:16.194 --> 43:18.127
Even Gizana's after it.

43:18.129 --> 43:20.630
Oh, no! [sighs]

43:22.033 --> 43:24.267
I need to get that book back.

[clattering]

43:44.956 --> 43:47.090
-Somebody's coming.
-[horse neigh]

43:49.060 --> 43:50.827
For a secret tunnel,

43:50.829 --> 43:52.729
it doesn't seem all that secret.

43:53.832 --> 43:55.698
-[squeaks]
-Who's there?

43:55.700 --> 43:57.133
Show yourself.

43:58.737 --> 44:00.303
[gasps]

44:00.305 --> 44:02.805
-Rockfried!
-[cat meows]

44:02.807 --> 44:07.176
I distinctly remember
telling someone to stay put.

44:07.178 --> 44:09.912
I'm sorry, I don't speak cat,

44:09.914 --> 44:11.881
but whatever excuse you're
coming up with,

44:11.883 --> 44:13.783
I don't believe it.

44:13.785 --> 44:16.252
I best go back and check
the door's closed properly.

44:16.254 --> 44:18.321
-[all] Bye, Emmy.
-Be careful.

44:18.323 --> 44:22.025
-See you later, guys.
-[female horse] Bye, Emmy.

Um...

44:31.403 --> 44:33.803

Curiouser and curiouser.

Guys, guys, don't stare,

Hmm.

44:58.730 --> 45:00.897
What's going on here?

45:00.899 --> 45:03.166
What did she mean she
doesn't speak cat?

45:03.168 --> 45:04.734
[horse neighs]

45:04.736 --> 45:07.103
I know, you'd tell me
if you could.

45:08.339 --> 45:12.241
You'd tell me what that
infernal girl is up to.

45:12.243 --> 45:14.410
[yells]

45:14.412 --> 45:15.978
Hmm.

45:15.980 --> 45:18.848
[horse chews]

45:19.918 --> 45:21.984
What about you, Donny?

45:21.986 --> 45:24.287
Do you have anything
you'd like to tell me?

45:24.289 --> 45:28.124
Anything you want to share? Hmm?

45:29.794 --> 45:33.963
-[lips smack]

She isn't really going
to lose the gift, is she?

46:44.169 --> 46:46.369
I would hate it if we
couldn't talk to her.

46:46.371 --> 46:48.271
We need to do something.

46:48.273 --> 46:49.972
There's only one thing for it.

We are her friends, aren't we?

46:55.313 --> 46:58.581
-What are you suggesting?
-Stealth mission.

46:58.583 --> 47:01.584
We take the tunnel,
sneak quietly into the castle,

47:01.586 --> 47:05.021
find Vincenzo's room,
and steal the book back.

47:05.023 --> 47:06.823

47:13.264 --> 47:15.097
Sneaking quietly
isn't what we do.

Exactly, it's the last
thing he'd expect.

-Fine. Great.

up single file.

Got Xaver to thank.

to thank you.

think it might have
been Rockfried?

50:37.435 --> 50:39.735
That's too much calamity
for such a little cat.

50:39.737 --> 50:43.139
Perhaps it was burglars,
thieves in the night.

50:43.141 --> 50:45.574
What kind of burglar
doesn't take anything?

52:31.415 --> 52:33.449
[Karla] Do you know
something about this?

52:34.886 --> 52:36.318
Emmy, why?

52:37.288 --> 52:40.289
Uh, guess what, my
foot's healed.

52:40.291 --> 52:41.490
[horse neighs]

52:42.360 --> 52:44.927
I have a duty, Your Majesties.

52:44.929 --> 52:48.797
I must ask myself, is this
the behavior of a princess?

52:48.799 --> 52:50.766
She didn't mean any harm.

52:50.768 --> 52:53.536
Yet the horses clearly
did not enter the castle

52:53.538 --> 52:54.937
of their own volition,

52:54.939 --> 52:56.739
they are merely
animals after all.

52:56.741 --> 52:59.675
Oh, couldn't you give her
just one more chance?

52:59.677 --> 53:00.876
We'd be really grateful.

53:00.878 --> 53:02.611
Three conditions.

53:02.613 --> 53:04.847
-[Karla] Name them.
-[Vincenzo] Number one,

53:04.849 --> 53:06.482
Emmy cleans the mess.

53:06.484 --> 53:09.285
No help, no assistance,
just her.

53:09.287 --> 53:11.720
-[Karla] Agreed.
-[Karl] Absolutely.

53:11.722 --> 53:14.790
[Vincenzo] Number two,
Emmy takes her studies seriously

53:14.792 --> 53:19.428
from now on, maximum effort,
all of the time.

53:19.430 --> 53:22.631
Dress starts at half past
six on the dot.

53:22.633 --> 53:24.233
[Karl] Could be tricky.

53:24.235 --> 53:26.302
[Vincenzo] This is my condition.

53:26.304 --> 53:28.938
-[Karla] OK, OK.
-[Karl] And what's number three?

53:28.940 --> 53:31.340
-[Vincenzo] No more horses.
-[gasps]

53:31.342 --> 53:33.909
[Vincenzo] We have seen
enough of them.

53:33.911 --> 53:35.844
If these conditions are met,

53:35.846 --> 53:38.681
Princess Day classes
will continue.

53:38.683 --> 53:42.685
If not, Emmy's invitation
shall be revoked.

53:42.687 --> 53:46.288
[Karla] Emmy. Emmy!

53:48.359 --> 53:51.493
Emmy, you came very close
to missing the Ball.

53:51.495 --> 53:53.729
Very, very close.

53:53.731 --> 53:56.699
But he said I can't
see my horses.

53:56.701 --> 53:59.768
Well, yes. Yes, he did,
and you should see it

53:59.770 --> 54:02.838
as a test, a test of character.

54:02.840 --> 54:05.374
Sebastian will take
care of the horses

54:05.376 --> 54:09.478
while you concentrate
on Mr. Vincenzo's classes.

54:09.480 --> 54:12.481
The sooner you prove you're
a proper little Princess,

54:12.483 --> 54:14.450
the sooner you get
your life back.

54:14.452 --> 54:15.484
Mm-hmm.

Ah, catching up on homework?

54:45.016 --> 54:48.984
-[gasps] David.
-<i> Carlotta and the Talking Gift.</i>

54:48.986 --> 54:50.653
I didn't know you
were interested

54:50.655 --> 54:52.755
in silly old legends.

54:52.757 --> 54:54.723
-I'm not.
-Oh, I see.

54:54.725 --> 54:57.326
And I always had you figured
as one of the smart ones.

54:57.328 --> 54:58.761
What's that supposed to mean?

54:58.763 --> 55:00.462
Don't worry, you're not
the first one

55:00.464 --> 55:02.931
she's fooled with the old
talking trick.

55:08.739 --> 55:11.440

Wait, wait, I'm coming,
I'm coming!

55:55.086 --> 55:58.420
Ah. Yes, I'm first.

55:58.422 --> 56:00.489
Morning, Emmy, what kept you?

[horses whinny]

56:10.134 --> 56:12.668
-Any sign?
-Nothing.

56:12.670 --> 56:15.738
It's like she's
forgotten all about us.

56:15.740 --> 56:17.673
[Caesar] She's busy.

56:17.675 --> 56:19.742
She'll come as soon as she can.

56:19.744 --> 56:21.410
I'm sure she will.

56:23.080 --> 56:25.147

56:39.063 --> 56:41.597
Am I first? Did I beat her?

56:41.599 --> 56:45.401
-Morning, Emmy, what kept you?
-[gasps]

56:45.403 --> 56:46.535
[Emmy groans]

56:46.537 --> 56:47.736
Mr. Cerimonata.

56:47.738 --> 56:49.138
Ah ha, understood?

56:49.140 --> 56:53.742
[Emmy] Mr. Cerimonata,
did I-- [sighs]

56:53.744 --> 56:56.445

56:56.447 --> 56:59.114
[whistling]

57:09.860 --> 57:12.461
[door opens]

57:13.731 --> 57:14.863
[ Emmy] Morning!

57:14.865 --> 57:16.732
<i> Senorita</i> Emmy.

57:17.902 --> 57:21.570
No Gizana? Strange.

57:21.572 --> 57:23.138
Very.

57:23.140 --> 57:24.907
[grunting]

57:27.812 --> 57:31.847
Sorry, Gizana, fair is fair.

You witch!

57:47.998 --> 57:51.600
-Should we get started?
-Wait, wait, I'm here!

57:51.602 --> 57:55.237
Gizana, how nice of
you to join us.

57:55.239 --> 57:58.006
Thank you, Emmy.
It's very nice to be here.

57:58.008 --> 57:59.107
What kept you?

57:59.109 --> 58:00.776
Enough chit chat.

58:00.778 --> 58:04.580
I have decided that today
will be a free day.

58:04.582 --> 58:05.581
No classes?

58:05.583 --> 58:06.915
No classes.

58:06.917 --> 58:09.017
Instead, I will take the
time to reflect

58:09.019 --> 58:11.620
on your progress, and
decide if you have

58:11.622 --> 58:13.255
reached the standard
required to attend

58:13.257 --> 58:15.924
the Princess Day Ball,
understood?

58:15.926 --> 58:17.559
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

58:17.561 --> 58:20.996
Good, then I will see you
tomorrow with my verdict.

58:29.673 --> 58:32.140
Any idea who put those--

58:32.142 --> 58:33.909

Oh, no, you don't!

58:38.616 --> 58:41.016
[panting]

58:41.018 --> 58:42.651
Come on, Emmy, the
longer this takes,

58:42.653 --> 58:44.620
the worse it's gonna be.

58:44.622 --> 58:45.621
Emmy!

58:45.623 --> 58:48.690
[panting]

58:49.293 --> 58:52.261
-[gasps]
-Morning, Gizana.

58:52.263 --> 58:53.262
What are you doing in here?

58:53.264 --> 58:55.030
I uh, felt like a muffin.

58:55.032 --> 58:57.666
You don't get muffins
out of a box.

58:57.668 --> 59:00.235
Come on, I'll show you
how to make them properly.

59:00.237 --> 59:03.038
Ah, this is the life.

59:03.040 --> 59:04.673
-[horses neigh]
-I'd love to have seen her face

59:04.675 --> 59:06.808
when she discovered
what you'd done.

59:06.810 --> 59:08.877
[panting]

59:08.879 --> 59:10.763
Excellent tactics, Emmy,

59:10.764 --> 59:12.648
and superb deployment
of resources, if I may say so.

59:12.650 --> 59:14.016
I know that girl.

59:14.018 --> 59:15.317
You shouldn't wind her up,

59:15.319 --> 59:17.619
not if she's sniffing around
about your gift.

59:17.621 --> 59:20.656
David convinced her
it's all a big fairy story.

59:20.658 --> 59:23.759
Carlotta, the talking gift,
everything.

59:23.761 --> 59:26.795
-[horses neigh]
-[Emmy] At Carlotta's tower.

59:26.797 --> 59:28.564
What could she do?

59:28.566 --> 59:30.299
And don't forget,
she doesn't have the map.

59:30.301 --> 59:33.602
-[horses neigh]
-Thank you, Paul.

59:33.604 --> 59:35.170
Now why don't the rest
of you take his advice

59:35.172 --> 59:37.339
and stop worrying so much.

59:37.341 --> 59:39.308
She can understand horses.

59:39.310 --> 59:42.611
Gizana won't find the book,
because she isn't looking

59:42.613 --> 59:45.781
for the book, she doesn't
even know I have it.

59:45.783 --> 59:48.083
It's nice and safe in the attic.

-[horse neighs]
-Exactly, I couldn't have

59:50.020 --> 59:51.253
put it better myself.

59:51.255 --> 59:52.955
So it is true.

59:52.957 --> 59:54.256

[Karla] There you are,
sweetheart.

1:00:17.348 --> 1:00:19.781
We need to decide on
the invitations.

1:00:19.783 --> 1:00:23.919
Velum or parchment? Which
do you prefer?

I'm Princess Gizana!

Why not?

1:04:14.918 --> 1:04:16.484
It doesn't even work.

1:04:16.486 --> 1:04:18.553
You're good at
tricking people, aren't you?

1:04:18.555 --> 1:04:20.155
I wasn't trying to trick anyone.

1:04:20.157 --> 1:04:22.357
You made me think
I could have the talking gift.

1:04:22.359 --> 1:04:24.893
You made me believe.

1:04:40.410 --> 1:04:43.144
I wanted to be special!

1:04:43.146 --> 1:04:47.115
I wanted to talk to horses,
but it's all a lie!
