WEBVTT

00:03.177 --> 00:06.963
Son, you better not be
eating my Fruity Puffs.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.965
What Fruity Puffs?

00:09.009 --> 00:11.272
Mom doesn'’t let you have
those sugar cereals anymore.

00:11.315 --> 00:12.969
"Let me have"?

00:13.013 --> 00:15.319
Nobody lets me
have anything.

00:15.363 --> 00:17.321
I'’m not scared
of your mama.

00:17.365 --> 00:19.062
Okay. Well, I didn'’t see
any Fruity Puffs

00:19.106 --> 00:21.282
in that cabinet.I know, '’cause
I hid '’em here.

00:23.719 --> 00:26.809
Okay, I see. S-So Mom'’s going
out of town for the weekend,

00:26.852 --> 00:28.811
you just gonna do
whatever you want to, huh?

00:28.854 --> 00:30.639
You know, son,
you don'’t understand

00:30.682 --> 00:32.597
what it'’s like
to be the man of the house.

00:32.641 --> 00:33.946
You'’re always worried

00:33.990 --> 00:35.078
about other people'’s needs.

00:35.122 --> 00:36.949
It'’s never really about you.

00:36.993 --> 00:39.778
But with your mother
going to Vegas overnight,

00:39.822 --> 00:44.044
the rest of this weekend
is about me and only me.

00:44.087 --> 00:46.872
Well, excuse me, Pop,

00:46.916 --> 00:49.440
but I will still be here.Yeah.

00:49.484 --> 00:51.486
But I don'’t care
about your needs.

00:52.574 --> 00:54.358
Calvin!
Mm.

00:54.402 --> 00:56.360
Yeah, babe.

00:56.404 --> 00:57.840
Hey, baby.
Can you do me a favor

00:57.883 --> 00:59.798
and take these to the car?Damn, Tina.

00:59.842 --> 01:01.148
You'’re only going away
for one night.

01:01.191 --> 01:02.671
Why do you need three bags?

01:02.714 --> 01:05.500
Well, this one is
for my clothes,

01:05.543 --> 01:07.328
this one is for
hair and makeup,

01:07.371 --> 01:08.459
and this one is empty.

01:08.503 --> 01:09.591
Mama'’s going shopping.

01:11.723 --> 01:14.552
And what else do you and Gemma
have planned for Vegas?

01:14.596 --> 01:17.729
Baby, how about you don'’t
ask me about my plans,

01:17.773 --> 01:20.080
and I won'’t ask you about
that box of Fruity Puffs

01:20.123 --> 01:22.473
that you got hiding
behind my cookbooks.

01:23.561 --> 01:24.693
Have a great trip.Okay.

01:26.912 --> 01:28.566
I'’m so excited!

01:28.610 --> 01:30.612
Tina and I are gonna
have so much fun.

01:30.655 --> 01:32.222
I know, your first
girls'’ trip.

01:32.266 --> 01:34.311
Man, I wish I could go.

01:34.355 --> 01:36.139
Okay, but then it wouldn'’t be

01:36.183 --> 01:38.533
much of a girls'’trip,
would it, sweetie?

01:38.576 --> 01:41.666
I know, but I really feel like
I could add to the experience.

01:41.710 --> 01:43.320
Like you two are
Thelma and Louise

01:43.364 --> 01:44.887
and I'’m Brad Pitt.

01:47.019 --> 01:48.151
Hey, guys.Hey.

01:48.195 --> 01:49.239
So, what do
you say, Gemma?

01:49.283 --> 01:50.936
You ready to have some fun?

01:50.980 --> 01:52.199
You know it, girl!Yeah!

01:52.242 --> 01:54.288
What do you say, Calvin?

01:54.331 --> 01:56.507
You ready to have
some fun, too?

01:56.551 --> 01:58.683
I got to load the bags, Dave.

02:01.338 --> 02:03.384
This one feels empty.

02:03.427 --> 02:05.212
Maybe I should climb
in and stow away.

02:05.255 --> 02:07.866
Hey, that'’s a good idea.
'’Cause you know what they say:

02:07.910 --> 02:09.999
what goes to Vegas
stays in Vegas.

02:12.088 --> 02:13.698
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

02:13.742 --> 02:14.699
♪ Welcome to the hood.

02:37.026 --> 02:41.204
♪ Hey, girl...

02:41.248 --> 02:43.641
Aw, that takes me back
to my player days right there.

02:43.685 --> 02:46.775
Tina lucky she locked me down.

02:46.818 --> 02:48.429
♪ Hey, boy...

02:48.472 --> 02:50.561
It'’s good to be the king.

02:50.605 --> 02:53.085
I thought all kings
wore robes.

02:53.129 --> 02:54.783
Well, they do.

02:54.826 --> 02:57.394
But I needed to let
the royal jewels breathe.

02:57.438 --> 02:59.483
Hey, man.

02:59.527 --> 03:01.485
So, this is how you'’re
fulfilling your needs

03:01.529 --> 03:03.226
for the weekend, huh?

03:03.270 --> 03:05.924
Sitting in your underwear,
listening to oldies,

03:05.968 --> 03:07.709
and giving yourself diabetes?

03:07.752 --> 03:10.581
It'’s pretty cool, right?

03:10.625 --> 03:12.496
You know what would
be pretty cool, Pop,

03:12.540 --> 03:14.455
is if you ordered the
pay-per-view fight for tonight.

03:14.498 --> 03:17.022
Posley versus Camargo.
Supposed to be a good one.

03:17.066 --> 03:19.721
But then I would be fulfilling
your needs as well as mine.

03:20.896 --> 03:21.853
Aw, what the hell.

03:21.897 --> 03:23.159
I'’m a benevolent king.

03:23.203 --> 03:26.031
Okay, well, I'’ll
let Marty know.

03:26.075 --> 03:27.772
Good. We'’ll make it
a guys'’ night.

03:27.816 --> 03:28.947
All right.
Well, I'’ll invite Dave.

03:28.991 --> 03:31.515
Now, hold on a second, now.

03:31.559 --> 03:32.690
What? How come?

03:32.734 --> 03:35.519
'’Cause Dave is not
the kind of guy

03:35.563 --> 03:37.521
you invite over for guys'’ night.

03:37.565 --> 03:39.741
I mean, now,

03:39.784 --> 03:42.134
we were having a men'’s brunch
with a wine tasting?

03:42.178 --> 03:43.788
All right, look, Pop, I know

03:43.832 --> 03:46.008
Dave is not your
typical kind of dude,

03:46.051 --> 03:47.879
but if you ask me,
Dave is a man.

03:47.923 --> 03:49.272
I know.

03:49.316 --> 03:51.753
That'’s why I don't ask you.

03:51.796 --> 03:53.363
Look, come on, Pop.

03:53.407 --> 03:56.192
He is a good husband and father
who takes care of his family.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.281
And he is not embarrassed
to be himself.

03:58.325 --> 04:00.196
There is no shame
in Dave'’s game.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.719
I know.

04:01.763 --> 04:04.679
Which is weird,
because there really should be.

04:04.722 --> 04:07.682
But that'’s what I'm saying, man.
Dave knows who he is,

04:07.725 --> 04:09.510
and he owns it
no matter what anyone thinks.

04:09.553 --> 04:11.686
Isn'’t that what makes a man
real to you?

04:11.729 --> 04:14.819
Fine. Go ahead.
Invite him.

04:14.863 --> 04:17.126
Probably doesn'’t even
like boxing.

04:17.169 --> 04:19.346
"Calvin, it'’s so barbaric.

04:19.389 --> 04:21.304
"Why can'’t they just settle
their differences

04:21.348 --> 04:23.306
with a rousing game
of Parcheesi?"

04:25.569 --> 04:28.964
Dave says, "Hell yes,"
and he is bringing snacks.

04:29.007 --> 04:30.661
Okay.Yeah.

04:30.705 --> 04:33.751
Well, maybe it won'’t be so bad.

04:33.795 --> 04:35.449
He wants to know what you like
on your veggie plate.

04:38.756 --> 04:42.369
Okay, we have a gondola ride
at the Venetian at 6:00,

04:42.412 --> 04:45.459
the dancing fountains at
the Bellagio at 7:30, and--

04:45.502 --> 04:47.287
drumroll, please--

04:47.330 --> 04:49.550
Donny and Marie
tickets at 9:00!

04:50.768 --> 04:52.466
Vegas, baby!

04:52.509 --> 04:54.468
♪ Girls'’ trip. ♪

04:54.511 --> 04:56.470
Gemma, the only girl
who'’s trippin' is you.

04:57.949 --> 04:59.647
Yeah, we only came here

04:59.690 --> 05:01.562
because you said that you needed
to blow off some steam.

05:01.605 --> 05:03.694
We'’re not doing
any of that corny stuff.

05:03.738 --> 05:05.870
But I made a whole
itinerary. Look.

05:05.914 --> 05:07.568
It'’s got little boxes
we can check off.

05:07.611 --> 05:10.092
Aw. Well, that'’s nice.

05:10.135 --> 05:12.007
But my itinerary
says that it'’s time

05:12.050 --> 05:13.791
to throw out
your itinerary.

05:13.835 --> 05:15.053
What?

05:15.097 --> 05:17.578
Check.

05:17.621 --> 05:19.797
I just thought
the more structure we had,

05:19.841 --> 05:21.538
the more we could pack
into our night.

05:21.582 --> 05:26.021
When I rage,
I try to rage efficiently.

05:26.064 --> 05:28.893
Gemma, a girls'’ night in Vegas
is like floating down a river.

05:28.937 --> 05:30.895
You know? You got
to go with the flow

05:30.939 --> 05:33.507
and see where it takes you.

05:33.550 --> 05:35.770
And why is your plan
better than mine?

05:35.813 --> 05:37.032
Because it'’s Vegas, girl.

05:37.075 --> 05:38.425
Always bet on black.

05:39.513 --> 05:41.776
Hey. Check it
out, ladies.

05:41.819 --> 05:43.473
The hottest show in town.

05:43.517 --> 05:46.258
See your wildest fantasies
onstage tonight.

05:49.697 --> 05:50.959
Magic Mike Live?

05:51.002 --> 05:54.223
What? Let me see that.

05:54.266 --> 05:55.833
It'’s just a bunch
of male strippers.

05:55.877 --> 05:57.792
Exactly. You see?

05:57.835 --> 06:01.099
We go with the flow, and plans
will fall right in our laps.

06:01.143 --> 06:02.362
And tonight some men will, too.

06:06.017 --> 06:08.019
Thanks again for inviting
me. Grover'’s at a sleepover.

06:08.063 --> 06:09.934
Otherwise I wouldn'’t
have been able to come.

06:09.978 --> 06:11.327
How convenient.

06:11.371 --> 06:14.722
You gonna get in on some
of this jicama, Calvin?

06:16.071 --> 06:17.986
It'’s in season.

06:18.029 --> 06:19.509
Well, fortunately,

06:19.553 --> 06:21.946
so is pizza.

06:21.990 --> 06:24.645
Man, this is great. Nothing
like a bunch of guys

06:24.688 --> 06:27.082
getting together to watch
a big fight.

06:27.125 --> 06:28.692
Whoa.

06:28.736 --> 06:30.564
I almost just double dipped.

06:30.607 --> 06:31.303
So...

06:34.611 --> 06:37.048
So, uh, Dave, who do you think'’s
gonna win the fight?

06:37.092 --> 06:38.354
Well, I don'’t know much
about these two fighters.

06:40.182 --> 06:43.359
But Camargo is undefeated
against southpaws,

06:43.403 --> 06:44.882
and nobody cuts the ring off
better than he does.

06:46.754 --> 06:48.669
And then, Posley

06:48.712 --> 06:50.192
does have
a three-inch reach advantage

06:50.235 --> 06:51.889
and a pretty solid chin.

06:57.286 --> 07:00.332
But I'’m rooting for Posley
'’cause I like his purple shorts.

07:04.511 --> 07:06.687
Hey, guys. Big fight night.

07:06.730 --> 07:09.080
Oh, I see the
jicama'’s in season.

07:09.124 --> 07:11.387
Yeah.

07:12.562 --> 07:15.391
Whoa. Wh-What'’s wrong
with the TV?

07:15.435 --> 07:17.088
Why'’s it all pixelated
like that?

07:17.132 --> 07:18.916
I don'’t know.
I paid for the fight.

07:18.960 --> 07:21.136
Well, maybe something'’s blocking
the satellite dish.

07:21.179 --> 07:23.312
Well, Marty, do something.
You work on satellites.

07:23.355 --> 07:25.880
Yeah, in space.

07:27.490 --> 07:30.275
Then it should be easier
down here.

07:30.319 --> 07:32.103
Okay.

07:32.147 --> 07:34.279
Let'’s just go outside
and take a look.

07:36.586 --> 07:38.719
I told you we shouldn'’t
have invited Dave.

07:38.762 --> 07:40.068
Oh, he had nothing to do
with this.

07:40.111 --> 07:41.286
I didn'’t say he did.

07:44.507 --> 07:46.509
Oh, there'’s the problem.

07:46.553 --> 07:48.511
The branch from Dave'’s tree
is blocking the signal.

07:48.555 --> 07:51.209
I knew this was Dave'’s fault.

07:51.253 --> 07:52.950
How is this my fault?

07:52.994 --> 07:55.126
Because you don'’t trim
your trees enough.

07:55.170 --> 07:58.347
Old raggedy-ass branches
just waving around

07:58.390 --> 08:01.132
like one of those things
in front of a used car lot.

08:02.569 --> 08:05.093
You know, it'’s a
California oak.

08:05.136 --> 08:07.269
I can'’t trim it. They're
protected by law.

08:07.312 --> 08:09.576
Oh. That must be why

08:09.619 --> 08:11.578
the cop cars cruise by here
three times a day.

08:11.621 --> 08:14.015
Yes, hi.
It'’s Dave Johnson.

08:14.058 --> 08:15.712
Local homeowner.

08:15.756 --> 08:17.279
Yeah, we have a bit
of a tree conun...

08:20.543 --> 08:21.892
Marty, get the ladder.

08:21.936 --> 08:23.851
Whoa, whoa, Pop, Pop,
you are not climbing

08:23.894 --> 08:25.853
on some old, rickety roof
with a chain saw.

08:25.896 --> 08:27.115
I'’ll be fine.

08:27.158 --> 08:28.246
How do you know that?

08:28.290 --> 08:30.814
'’Cause you're gonna do it.

08:30.858 --> 08:33.600
No, I'’m not. You heard Dave.
Trimming an oak is illegal.

08:33.643 --> 08:35.515
I done stayed out of jail
this long.

08:35.558 --> 08:37.473
I'’m not going in
for assaulting a tree.

08:37.517 --> 08:40.563
Hmm. Okay.
Then Marty will do it.

08:40.607 --> 08:43.261
Oh, Dad, uh...

08:43.305 --> 08:46.526
you know I would do anything
to prove to you that I am a man,

08:46.569 --> 08:49.920
but I'’m scared of heights, and I
just ate a lot of jicama, so...

08:51.835 --> 08:54.055
Fine. Since none
of you will do it,

08:54.098 --> 08:55.230
I guess I will.

08:55.273 --> 08:56.405
No, you won'’t.

08:58.146 --> 09:00.714
Give me the chain saw.

09:00.757 --> 09:04.456
Really?
Mr. I Like His Purple Shorts?

09:04.500 --> 09:07.024
Yeah, that'’s right.
Look, it'’s my tree.

09:07.068 --> 09:09.331
My property.
My responsibility.

09:09.374 --> 09:11.986
Okay. Go ahead.

09:12.029 --> 09:14.510
Wait, wait. Dave, are you sure
you know how to use that thing?

09:14.554 --> 09:16.164
Oh, relax.Whoa, man!

09:18.427 --> 09:20.603
I got this.
Now, before I go up there,

09:20.647 --> 09:22.474
I'’m gonna need two things:
hold the ladder and...

09:23.867 --> 09:25.086
...watch out for Five-O.

09:35.226 --> 09:36.401
I don'’t know about this.

09:36.445 --> 09:38.012
You don'’t know about what?

09:38.055 --> 09:39.666
Hot men?

09:41.406 --> 09:44.235
It'’s just, this isn't
my kind of thing.

09:44.279 --> 09:45.628
I know Donny and Marie

09:45.672 --> 09:48.849
are a solid five
out of five stars on Yelp.

09:48.892 --> 09:52.461
Yeah, but that guy has a
solid six out of six abs.

09:52.504 --> 09:55.420
Tina! That is somebody'’s son.

09:55.464 --> 09:57.248
Mm-hmm. And somebody
raised him right!

09:57.292 --> 09:59.337
Okay. Okay.

09:59.381 --> 10:01.949
But what would Calvin think
if he knew you were here

10:01.992 --> 10:04.473
surrounded by all these
hot, shirtless guys?

10:04.516 --> 10:06.431
He doesn'’t care.
In our house,

10:06.475 --> 10:08.172
it doesn'’t matter where
you get your appetite,

10:08.216 --> 10:09.826
as long as you
come home to eat.

10:14.526 --> 10:15.876
Okay, I'’m up.

10:17.442 --> 10:18.618
Looking good, Dave!

10:18.661 --> 10:20.097
He is gonna die.

10:22.491 --> 10:25.320
Come on, man, get to it!
Fight starts in five minutes.

10:25.363 --> 10:27.322
Okay, here we go.

10:27.365 --> 10:30.630
Whoa.

10:32.370 --> 10:33.981
It really shakes in your hands!

10:36.723 --> 10:39.421
Maybe I should call 911 now so
they'’re already on their way.

10:41.510 --> 10:43.120
I can'’t reach it.

10:43.164 --> 10:44.295
All right, then-then
just come back down, man.

10:44.339 --> 10:45.470
Don'’t risk it.

10:45.514 --> 10:48.082
Or get up on your tippy-toes!

10:51.346 --> 10:53.653
I'’m so close!

10:55.742 --> 10:57.526
Whoa!

10:57.569 --> 10:58.832
Be careful, David!

10:58.875 --> 11:00.703
Yeah, seriously, man!
That'’s a new chain saw!

11:00.747 --> 11:02.662
Almost got it.

11:04.751 --> 11:05.882
Oh!

11:05.926 --> 11:08.015
Yes!

11:08.058 --> 11:09.886
Oh!All right!

11:09.930 --> 11:11.758
I told you I could do it!

11:11.801 --> 11:13.760
Hey, y-you know what?
You sure did, man. Now, please,

11:13.803 --> 11:15.022
just come on
down, all right?

11:15.065 --> 11:17.198
Okay, okay.
But seriously,

11:17.241 --> 11:19.156
you should'’ve seen the look
on your faces

11:19.200 --> 11:20.941
when you thought
I was gonna-- Whoa! Whoa!

11:20.984 --> 11:23.726
Oh, Daddy, no! Ooh!

11:23.770 --> 11:25.728
Oh, Pop! Pop!

11:25.772 --> 11:27.904
Oh, Pop.

11:38.872 --> 11:40.700
Oh, my God, Calvin.
If you didn'’t break my fall,

11:40.743 --> 11:44.486
I could be dead
right now.

11:44.529 --> 11:47.445
I know. That'’s what I keep
thinking, too.

11:47.489 --> 11:50.405
Are you sure you don'’t want
to go to the hospital?

11:50.448 --> 11:51.449
Oh, no, I'’m fine.
Thank you, though.

11:53.321 --> 11:55.715
You-- oh, you-you mean Calvin.

11:55.758 --> 11:58.674
No, I'’m-I'm all right; it'’s just
my back'’s out a little bit.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.328
Help-help me sit down.

12:00.371 --> 12:02.199
All right. Easy.Okay, you know,
the craziest part

12:02.243 --> 12:04.245
was how Dave bounced
off of you and landed

12:04.288 --> 12:05.768
right back on top of you.

12:05.812 --> 12:07.727
Like, the science of that

12:07.770 --> 12:09.946
is-is...

12:09.990 --> 12:12.166
Maybe that'’s for another time.

12:12.209 --> 12:15.517
All I know is this damn TV
better be working.

12:16.953 --> 12:17.911
Pop, Pop.Get the remote, Marty.

12:17.954 --> 12:19.608
Yeah, I got it,
I got it.

12:19.651 --> 12:21.218
Hey, it'’s working.

12:21.262 --> 12:23.830
Oh, man, this is killing me.

12:23.873 --> 12:26.267
Gosh, Calvin, you know,
I can'’t help

12:26.310 --> 12:28.356
but feel somewhat responsible
for all this.

12:31.794 --> 12:33.796
You know what?
Let me run next door and get you

12:33.840 --> 12:36.016
some of Gemma'’s prescription
muscle relaxants.

12:36.059 --> 12:37.800
Why does Gemma have
muscle relaxants?

12:37.844 --> 12:39.454
Oh, well, the doctor
just gave them to her

12:39.497 --> 12:40.803
for when her menstrual cramps
get real bad.

12:40.847 --> 12:44.067
Oh.

12:44.111 --> 12:48.550
I'’m not taking your wife's
period pills, Dave.

12:48.593 --> 12:50.813
No, no, no, Calvin,
they'’re not her period pills.

12:50.857 --> 12:52.597
They'’re just the pills she takes
when she'’s on her period.

12:54.512 --> 12:56.645
MALCOLM:
Whoa, whoa, Pop.

12:56.688 --> 12:58.342
You just can'’t sit here
like this, man.

12:58.386 --> 12:59.779
Yeah, man,
you look miserable.

12:59.822 --> 13:00.780
Yeah, you know what?
They'’re right.

13:00.823 --> 13:02.172
Luckily, Calvin,

13:02.216 --> 13:04.566
I have another
solution.

13:04.609 --> 13:07.743
I give an amazing massage.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.789
Get the pills.
Get the damn pills, Dave!

13:12.617 --> 13:15.316
Yeah! Work it, baby.

13:15.359 --> 13:17.057
Hump that floor!

13:18.798 --> 13:21.104
I think
I'’m starting to get it.

13:21.148 --> 13:23.890
All of these men are here
for ourpleasure,

13:23.933 --> 13:26.196
asking what we want.

13:26.240 --> 13:28.372
No one ever asks women
what they want.

13:28.416 --> 13:31.158
Look at him twirling
that T-shirt over his head

13:31.201 --> 13:32.507
like a sexy helicopter.

13:34.378 --> 13:36.293
It'’s almost as if

13:36.337 --> 13:39.035
Magic Mikeis the ultimate
expression of feminism.

13:41.037 --> 13:43.387
Oh! Oh-oh-oh! Black Hawk down!

13:44.780 --> 13:47.000
I'’m going--
oh, oh, oh, oh!
Wait.

13:47.043 --> 13:48.088
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

13:48.131 --> 13:49.785
Come on!
We'’re going to the stage.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.613
What-what? Wait, wait, wait!
Tina! Tina!

13:51.656 --> 13:53.310
I don'’t think I'm ready
for this much feminism.

13:56.139 --> 13:58.098
What'’s about to happen?

13:58.141 --> 14:00.752
Magic, Gemma. Magic.

14:04.017 --> 14:06.976
Wow, round five and
Posley'’s still in it.Well, yeah,

14:07.020 --> 14:08.369
but look how much he'’s bleeding.

14:08.412 --> 14:09.849
Ah, get him, Camargo!

14:11.633 --> 14:13.461
Hey, Pop, those pills
making you feel any better?

14:13.504 --> 14:15.289
Actually...

14:17.639 --> 14:19.728
...quite a bit.

14:19.771 --> 14:24.167
But why do these guys keep
hitting each other like that?

14:25.473 --> 14:28.258
With all of the violence
in the world,

14:28.302 --> 14:30.260
don'’t you think
it'’s a better way

14:30.304 --> 14:31.871
they can solve their problems?

14:34.569 --> 14:36.223
Um, like what?

14:36.266 --> 14:39.661
Like a dance-off.

14:39.704 --> 14:41.663
Or a staring contest?

14:50.150 --> 14:52.630
Yeah, let... let-let me
see those pills.

14:52.674 --> 14:55.068
Just...

14:55.111 --> 14:59.028
"The side effects may include
dizziness, drowsiness,

14:59.072 --> 15:02.292
and emotional sensitivity."

15:02.336 --> 15:06.079
What the world needs is love.

15:07.863 --> 15:10.822
Okay, look--
I-I only gave him two.

15:10.866 --> 15:13.086
Oh, wait.
I just gave him two.

15:15.436 --> 15:17.090
Can I give him two more?

15:19.440 --> 15:22.878
Malcolm. Malcolm,
where are you, boy?

15:22.922 --> 15:24.271
Yeah-- hey, hey, hey, hey, Pop.

15:24.314 --> 15:25.141
I'’m sitting
right next to you, man.

15:25.185 --> 15:28.579
Oh. There you are.Yeah.

15:28.623 --> 15:29.841
Come here, son.

15:29.885 --> 15:32.583
O-Okay.

15:32.627 --> 15:34.107
Malcolm.
Yeah?

15:34.150 --> 15:36.239
You'’re my firstborn son.

15:36.283 --> 15:37.632
Yeah.

15:37.675 --> 15:39.677
And I love you, boy.Uh-huh.

15:41.288 --> 15:43.333
Hey, uh, thanks, Pop.Yeah.

15:43.377 --> 15:45.031
Marty?

15:47.033 --> 15:48.338
Yes, Dad?

15:48.382 --> 15:51.515
I was just seeing
if you were still here.

15:55.389 --> 15:57.608
O-Okay. Okay.

15:57.652 --> 16:00.655
Okay, guys, I-I'’m starting
to get a little worried.

16:00.698 --> 16:02.700
Calvin, you'’ve ingested
some pretty serious drugs,

16:02.744 --> 16:05.225
and you'’re experiencing
side effects.

16:08.097 --> 16:10.795
Is there anything
you need?

16:12.972 --> 16:15.148
Well, you know what?

16:15.191 --> 16:18.151
Now that you mention it,
there is.

16:18.194 --> 16:21.981
Ok-Okay, what is it?

16:22.024 --> 16:24.984
Does that offer for a back rub
still stand?

16:36.778 --> 16:39.911
You guys heard him!
He asked.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.183
Oh! Oh.Yeah.

16:53.055 --> 16:55.057
Hi, I'’m Gemma.

16:55.101 --> 16:58.060
I really appreciate
your progressiveness

16:58.104 --> 16:59.105
and your willingness
to objectify yourself

16:59.148 --> 17:00.497
for my pleasure.

17:00.541 --> 17:03.805
Gemma, shut up and
make some noise!

17:05.372 --> 17:07.678
Now, where are you comfortable
with me putting my hands?

17:07.722 --> 17:10.333
That works.

17:10.377 --> 17:12.292
Come on, Gemma,
get out of your head.

17:12.335 --> 17:14.381
This is our girls'’ trip.

17:14.424 --> 17:17.123
You'’re right.
Like Thelma and Louise.

17:17.166 --> 17:18.863
Yes. There you go.Yeah.

17:18.907 --> 17:20.300
Now, come on, Thelma.
Do you trust me?

17:20.343 --> 17:21.866
I do, Louise.

17:21.910 --> 17:23.738
Do you trust in the magic
of Vegas?

17:23.781 --> 17:24.913
Yes.

17:24.956 --> 17:26.001
And of our girls'’ trips?

17:26.045 --> 17:29.222
Ooh-- okay.

17:29.265 --> 17:31.093
Then, come on, girl,
let'’s ride this thing

17:31.137 --> 17:32.268
over the cliff together!

17:33.661 --> 17:35.445
You sit down.
I can do this.

17:35.489 --> 17:37.665
See, I used to do
this back in the day.

17:37.708 --> 17:39.449
Hey, hey.

17:50.982 --> 17:54.073
And to think, after this, we can
still go to Donny and Marie!

17:56.510 --> 17:58.686
Okay, Calvin,
how we doing?

17:58.729 --> 18:00.949
I don'’t know what your hands

18:00.992 --> 18:04.474
are doing back there, Dave,
but don'’t stop.

18:06.607 --> 18:08.739
Do you think Pop'’s
gonna remember any of this?

18:08.783 --> 18:11.612
No, I don'’t.

18:11.655 --> 18:13.962
Which is why I'’ve
been recording.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.575
Okay.

18:18.619 --> 18:21.143
I think we got
all the knots out.

18:21.187 --> 18:23.145
Oh, man, fight'’s over.

18:23.189 --> 18:24.581
Yeah, but I think
we can all agree

18:24.625 --> 18:26.105
that this was
the main event.

18:29.456 --> 18:31.980
How you doing, Calvin?
You feeling okay?

18:32.023 --> 18:33.808
Oh, so much better.

18:33.851 --> 18:36.071
You know what?

18:36.115 --> 18:39.466
Dave, I... have to admit,

18:39.509 --> 18:42.991
when Malcolm first suggested
inviting you tonight,

18:43.034 --> 18:46.690
I was like "Boo.

18:46.734 --> 18:49.258
Bad idea."

18:49.302 --> 18:53.871
But now I'’m more like,
"Yay!

18:53.915 --> 18:55.699
Dave'’s here."

18:57.658 --> 18:59.703
Well, I-I'’m glad
you came around.

18:59.747 --> 19:03.359
Now, don'’t tell you
I said this.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.408
I don'’t give you
enough credit.

19:08.451 --> 19:12.107
I mean, you'’re not as soft
as I thought.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.936
Sure, yeah,
you smile too much

19:14.979 --> 19:17.939
and you go
to Disneyland by yourself...

19:21.812 --> 19:27.427
...but you, you got up
on that roof with a chain saw

19:27.470 --> 19:30.299
and you did something
dangerous and stupid.

19:32.345 --> 19:35.348
And to me, that'’s a man.

19:38.873 --> 19:41.136
I appreciate that, Calvin.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.182
Okeydokey.

19:43.225 --> 19:45.096
My eyes are gonna
go to sleep now.

19:52.365 --> 19:54.367
Sweet dreams, buddy.

19:56.804 --> 19:59.154
Oh, and I'’m gonna
need copies of that

19:59.198 --> 20:01.330
texted and e-mailed to me
immediately!

20:09.904 --> 20:11.166
Hey, Dave.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.994
Oh, hey, Calvin.
How'’s the back?

20:13.037 --> 20:16.432
Eh, a little sore, but better.

20:16.476 --> 20:18.869
Man, those pills were strong.

20:18.913 --> 20:21.394
I don'’t even remember the fight.

20:21.437 --> 20:24.397
Oh, well, uh...

20:24.440 --> 20:25.485
you enjoyed it.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.491
Oh, hey, honey.
How was your trip?

20:31.534 --> 20:33.449
I'’ll tell you
all about it inside.

20:33.493 --> 20:34.668
Well, you don'’t want
to grab your bag...Nope.

20:34.711 --> 20:36.060
Mama came home hungry.

20:42.502 --> 20:45.896
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Tina, I know that look,

20:45.940 --> 20:47.898
but, baby,
I hurt my back, okay?

20:47.942 --> 20:50.379
Oh, you poor baby.

20:50.423 --> 20:52.338
It'’s a good thing
I only need your front.

20:55.166 --> 20:56.907
All right, all right.

20:56.951 --> 20:59.214
But first, let me take
my period pills.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.171
All right.
