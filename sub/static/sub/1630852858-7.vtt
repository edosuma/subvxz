00:10.635 --> 00:11.970
What's with that look?

00:15.140 --> 00:17.684
- What's with that look?
- Stop!

00:21.021 --> 00:22.397
Stop!

00:23.440 --> 00:27.944
No! Stop!

00:31.906 --> 00:33.158
- No!
- Sakura!

00:35.076 --> 00:36.036
Stop it!

00:38.538 --> 00:40.749
- What do you think you're doing?
- Don't!

00:42.917 --> 00:45.795
Go ahead, punch me.

00:46.671 --> 00:47.839
Go on, punch me.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.388
I'm not like you.

00:59.684 --> 01:01.978
Let's get out of here, Sakura.

01:05.440 --> 01:06.357
Hold it.

01:06.441 --> 01:10.153
I already called the police.

01:12.864 --> 01:15.867
No explanation will redeem you
from this situation.

01:22.207 --> 01:23.374
Let's go.

01:48.983 --> 01:51.945
Thank you for saving me.

01:52.529 --> 01:54.322
Are you in pain? Those bruises…

01:54.906 --> 01:56.199
I'm doing okay.

01:58.493 --> 02:00.286
You should go home.

02:03.540 --> 02:05.834
You shouldn't have to deal with this.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.713
I can't continue to burden you.

02:12.298 --> 02:16.177
It's in your best interest
not to be involved with me anymore.

02:29.065 --> 02:30.066
Sakura…

02:32.235 --> 02:34.362
The accident that you spoke about before…

02:35.196 --> 02:36.656
You were talking about when

02:37.282 --> 02:39.659
a shattered window fell on you
seven years ago, weren't you?

02:42.620 --> 02:43.538
What?

02:44.372 --> 02:46.583
You shielded a little girl.

02:48.418 --> 02:51.504
The shards of glass fell on you,
and you were seriously hurt.

02:55.174 --> 02:57.510
How do you know about that?

03:01.055 --> 03:02.557
Because I was there too.

03:04.976 --> 03:08.563
The little girl that you saved back then,

03:09.522 --> 03:10.732
that was Ran.

03:15.278 --> 03:16.446
It was Ran?

03:18.823 --> 03:20.074
Yes.

03:22.911 --> 03:23.912
In that moment,

03:26.122 --> 03:28.499
my legs froze in place,

03:29.542 --> 03:30.919
and I couldn't do anything.

03:33.755 --> 03:35.423
But not you.

03:41.012 --> 03:42.472
After that accident,

03:43.389 --> 03:45.516
I stopped working for my father's company.

03:46.601 --> 03:47.810
And since then,

03:49.395 --> 03:51.481
you'd cross my mind from time to time.

03:55.443 --> 03:57.195
I wondered how you were doing.

03:59.113 --> 04:00.365
I thought about

04:02.075 --> 04:04.244
what you might think if you saw me now.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.088
So…

04:17.757 --> 04:19.259
You knew this whole time?

04:22.929 --> 04:23.846
I did.

04:25.848 --> 04:27.809
When I ran into you again,

04:29.394 --> 04:30.937
I couldn't contain my excitement.

04:33.940 --> 04:36.276
I felt awkward about bringing this up.

04:39.445 --> 04:43.032
I didn't want you to think that I had
some fleeting longing for you,

04:43.116 --> 04:44.867
or that I was delusional.

04:50.873 --> 04:53.501
But I hadn't considered that

04:54.168 --> 04:57.213
you've had to give up your life's calling
because of that accident.

05:03.177 --> 05:04.429
It's my fault.

05:05.638 --> 05:07.432
I should've stepped in to protect Ran.

05:09.434 --> 05:10.476
I'm so sorry.

05:15.982 --> 05:17.358
Hold on.

05:17.442 --> 05:18.943
That's not it.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.698
It's not your fault.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.496
Still, Sakura…

05:33.291 --> 05:34.709
I'm certain that

05:36.377 --> 05:37.754
I love you.

05:43.593 --> 05:44.761
So please,

05:46.679 --> 05:48.806
don't say that you're not worth my time.

05:52.226 --> 05:53.811
You're a strong person.

05:55.021 --> 05:56.272
You're resilient.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.525
And unbelievably beautiful.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.198
I see that in you.

06:12.955 --> 06:14.165
Will you please…

06:17.877 --> 06:19.587
stay with me from now on?

06:29.305 --> 06:30.431
There's no rush…

06:32.809 --> 06:34.227
to give me an answer.

06:36.604 --> 06:38.064
Please think about it.

07:22.525 --> 07:26.154
Oh, my. Look how stunning this kitchen is.

07:26.696 --> 07:29.532
Look, they have color options too.

07:29.615 --> 07:32.952
- Say, Yuriha, which would you choose?
- Yes.

07:34.328 --> 07:37.665
I think I would go for a chic finish.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.460
- Something like this.
- Huh?

07:41.085 --> 07:44.338
Wouldn't a brighter kitchen be better?
It would lift the spirit.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.216
I like this one.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.552
Looks nice. I say let's go with that.

07:54.140 --> 07:55.183
That sounds good.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.895
I'm so excited for this renovation.

08:09.113 --> 08:09.947
Hey.

08:10.615 --> 08:12.825
Could you be a little more
considerate with my mom?

08:13.993 --> 08:15.995
We're going to be living together.

08:16.579 --> 08:20.750
She'll be helping us out with chores
and looking after the kids.

08:21.542 --> 08:23.169
Can you try to get along?

08:25.796 --> 08:28.174
You're right. I apologize.

08:49.153 --> 08:50.196
What's wrong?

08:51.739 --> 08:53.199
I'm not in the mood.

08:55.076 --> 08:58.955
You can't get it up anymore
because your wife left you?

08:59.872 --> 09:00.748
What?

09:02.291 --> 09:04.085
Poor you.

09:05.545 --> 09:11.217
And you? Aren't you here because
your husband doesn't pay attention to you?

09:13.678 --> 09:15.471
What a miserable woman.

09:44.959 --> 09:47.461
I bought a few things you might like.

09:48.129 --> 09:49.046
Thank you.

09:51.257 --> 09:53.718
Sakura, you need to eat.

09:59.265 --> 10:01.267
I hope the goldfish are okay.

10:05.146 --> 10:06.981
You should head home as soon as possible.

10:08.357 --> 10:11.277
You need to feed them too.

10:13.362 --> 10:14.780
That's true, but…

10:15.489 --> 10:17.366
I can't leave you here alone.

10:21.037 --> 10:24.707
- I'll head home too.
- What? But--

10:24.790 --> 10:28.711
No matter where I am,
eventually he'll find me.

10:28.794 --> 10:30.004
It's all the same.

10:32.381 --> 10:33.716
Sakura…

10:41.724 --> 10:42.850
So…

10:44.560 --> 10:45.770
Let's go home.

10:49.273 --> 10:50.941
Let's stay together.

10:54.445 --> 10:55.279
Okay.

11:15.508 --> 11:16.801
I'm so glad.

11:18.302 --> 11:19.637
Everyone looks well.

11:27.019 --> 11:28.813
- Sakura.
- Yeah?

11:31.315 --> 11:32.650
When thing settle down,

11:33.484 --> 11:35.403
let's think about our next steps together.

11:37.279 --> 11:38.364
About our future.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.036
Okay.

12:42.928 --> 12:45.097
- Good morning.
- Morning.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.226
- Sakura.
- Yes?

12:49.894 --> 12:53.147
Please leave the shop closed today.
I have some errands to run.

12:53.230 --> 12:54.356
Where are you going?

12:55.065 --> 12:56.567
I'm going to meet with your husband.

12:58.486 --> 12:59.528
Hold on.

13:00.738 --> 13:02.656
Please don't. Who knows what he'll do--

13:02.740 --> 13:05.326
It's all right. I'll go reason with him.

13:07.203 --> 13:08.370
But…

13:12.875 --> 13:14.168
It's going to be okay.

13:26.680 --> 13:27.681
Masako.

13:29.016 --> 13:30.059
Good morning.

13:31.060 --> 13:33.812
I have an errand nearby,
so I thought I'd drop in.

13:45.241 --> 13:46.408
Those bruises…

13:47.785 --> 13:49.328
What happened?

13:54.500 --> 13:55.668
I see.

13:58.629 --> 14:00.172
You've been through a lot.

14:02.341 --> 14:03.259
Yes.

14:05.678 --> 14:09.265
Haruto, even if you go to see him,

14:09.807 --> 14:12.476
there's no guarantee
that Takuya Hiraga will speak with you.

14:13.394 --> 14:15.229
It might make things more complicated.

14:15.312 --> 14:19.024
But we can't leave things as they are.
Something has to be done.

14:24.405 --> 14:30.369
Sakura, are you certain
you want to move forward with a divorce?

14:34.248 --> 14:35.165
Yes.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.086
I want a divorce.

14:40.546 --> 14:44.383
In that case, taking legal action
would be in your best interest.

14:45.342 --> 14:46.802
Taking legal action?

14:46.886 --> 14:50.556
DV is a legitimate legal basis
for choosing to divorce.

14:51.223 --> 14:53.267
But it can depend on the degree

14:53.350 --> 14:55.686
and the frequency
of incidents of violence.

14:58.647 --> 15:02.693
The opposing team will have a plethora
of rebuttals if there is no proof.

15:13.954 --> 15:15.039
- Yuriha.
- Yes.

15:15.122 --> 15:17.249
Where did this dispenser come from?

15:17.333 --> 15:20.669
I rented it just for the duration
of the renovations.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.546
I'm relieved.

15:22.630 --> 15:26.216
I was just thinking that it doesn't
match the design of the new kitchen.

15:27.051 --> 15:28.344
You're right.

15:30.512 --> 15:32.973
- May I?
- Please.

15:42.691 --> 15:45.569
Did you see that? How off-putting.

16:13.764 --> 16:15.849
I'm sorry about earlier.

16:17.184 --> 16:21.438
You heard it, right? My mother-in-law
commented about your bruise.

16:23.148 --> 16:24.149
It's nothing.

16:24.733 --> 16:28.028
Hey, I have a similar mark, right here.

16:29.321 --> 16:32.825
I've hidden it pretty well, haven't I?

16:34.451 --> 16:36.203
I've had it from birth,

16:36.286 --> 16:38.622
but isn't it remarkable?
We have them in the same spot.

16:39.707 --> 16:41.959
Well, this…

16:43.002 --> 16:45.170
It's just the spot
where I got hit by a plank.

16:47.715 --> 16:49.675
- Hey, can you lend me a hand.
- Sure.

17:16.785 --> 17:18.746
We're headed to the bathhouse.

17:19.872 --> 17:23.000
They have enormous bathtubs.
Come with us, Daddy.

17:23.083 --> 17:25.419
Yeah, you should come too, Momoki.

17:25.502 --> 17:29.506
It's fine. There's no point in him coming.
They won't let him bathe.

17:29.590 --> 17:32.092
- Really, Akina?
- But it's true.

17:32.760 --> 17:36.138
Because of his tattoo, we can't even enjoy
a visit to the pool as a family.

17:37.598 --> 17:39.767
And he can't work a corporate job.

17:40.642 --> 17:42.478
We don't even qualify for life insurance.

17:42.561 --> 17:44.313
- I hate it so much.
- Bye-bye.

17:45.481 --> 17:47.149
Would you hurry up and have it removed?

18:13.217 --> 18:14.259
So, hey,

18:15.052 --> 18:16.762
when we all start living together,

18:16.845 --> 18:20.933
would you mind
keeping your makeup on around my mom?

18:22.643 --> 18:25.312
I mean, I don't mind.

18:26.105 --> 18:30.275
But I think it would
shock my mom to see it.

18:31.985 --> 18:34.279
Let's not make things awkward
because of that, okay?

18:34.363 --> 18:37.241
I would hate for you
to get your feelings hurt.

18:41.286 --> 18:42.162
Okay.

18:44.998 --> 18:46.291
In that case,

18:47.251 --> 18:50.254
could you add a bathroom
to the second story too?

18:50.838 --> 18:51.880
What?

18:51.964 --> 18:54.842
Otherwise, it would be impossible to hide.

18:55.467 --> 18:57.553
Please? It doesn't have to be huge.

18:59.054 --> 19:01.682
Okay, that makes sense.

19:03.183 --> 19:04.893
I got it. We'll add that.

19:06.645 --> 19:07.604
Thank you.

19:24.538 --> 19:28.333
For the entrance,
we're only planning to redo the flooring.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.961
- But what do you think?
- I see.

19:31.712 --> 19:36.175
In that case, white would be
the best color in terms of Feng Shui.

19:37.134 --> 19:39.386
It helps to improve the flow of income.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.555
Then white it is.

19:43.932 --> 19:46.268
Do you plan on leaving that window as is?

19:46.351 --> 19:49.313
Yes, currently we don't have plans
to change it.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.690
I see.

19:54.943 --> 19:56.195
Is there a problem with it?

19:57.779 --> 19:59.031
No, not at all.

20:13.712 --> 20:17.007
Thank you so much for your help today.

20:17.925 --> 20:20.010
My mother-in-law was listening diligently,

20:20.093 --> 20:22.471
and wants to follow
every piece of your advice.

20:24.181 --> 20:26.266
When you're in this house,

20:26.350 --> 20:30.395
your energy seems completely different
than when you're outside.

20:32.147 --> 20:34.316
What? Do you think so?

20:34.399 --> 20:37.027
However, neither expression
is truly authentic to you.

20:39.821 --> 20:42.324
I sense that you might be suffering.

20:42.908 --> 20:45.244
The stress of behaving
unlike yourself all the time

20:45.953 --> 20:48.497
must be getting to you.

21:18.819 --> 21:21.530
- Did you forget something?
- No.

21:23.323 --> 21:24.408
The other day,

21:25.409 --> 21:28.912
you spoke about your scar.

21:31.248 --> 21:33.792
I was wondering
if I could ask you something.

21:37.879 --> 21:41.174
Wow, incredible.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.260
It's beautiful.

21:44.261 --> 21:45.846
- You think so?
- I do.

22:05.365 --> 22:08.243
The owl symbolizes the god of carpentry.

22:09.578 --> 22:12.706
My dad and my grandfather
were both carpenters.

22:12.789 --> 22:16.168
I got this tattoo when I made
the decision to join this industry.

22:17.044 --> 22:20.297
I see. It's a representation
of your commitment.

22:21.798 --> 22:25.052
- That's correct.
- So why hide it?

22:27.137 --> 22:28.847
My wife doesn't like it.

22:31.016 --> 22:34.478
When we were dating,
she told me it was cool.

22:34.561 --> 22:38.690
But now, she looks at me as if
she's seeing some foul creature.

22:41.318 --> 22:44.905
- I see.
- I thought about having it removed.

22:45.572 --> 22:48.825
But it would cost a fortune
for a piece this large.

22:50.577 --> 22:54.414
So when I saw that
you could cover your scar so cleanly,

22:54.915 --> 22:57.292
I thought maybe this
would work for me, too.

22:58.752 --> 23:01.421
- Sorry for the sudden visit.
- It's okay.

23:02.130 --> 23:04.966
It makes me happy
that my makeup skills can be of service.

23:10.764 --> 23:13.850
Isn't it a huge chore
to do this every day?

23:15.185 --> 23:16.937
Not at all, I'm used to it by now.

23:17.646 --> 23:19.648
I've been doing this since
I was in high school.

23:21.733 --> 23:23.068
I was so happy.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.780
The first time I saw my face
without the mark,

23:27.572 --> 23:30.283
I thought, "Now I'm finally
the same as everyone else."

23:31.660 --> 23:35.997
From that point on, I couldn't imagine
living life without makeup.

23:38.792 --> 23:41.086
My husband tells me
I worry too much about it.

23:41.670 --> 23:43.922
Your husband is a kind person.

23:48.093 --> 23:50.762
- Not really.
- What?

23:50.846 --> 23:52.973
He says that.

23:54.266 --> 23:56.184
But he actually pities me.

23:57.018 --> 23:58.311
He looks down on me.

23:59.938 --> 24:02.190
I've had this mark for the longest time.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.068
I can see it in his eyes.

24:09.322 --> 24:10.448
My husband thinks

24:11.199 --> 24:15.162
that he's a hero for having married
such a pitiful woman.

24:16.496 --> 24:18.415
That's why he makes all the decisions

24:19.624 --> 24:22.377
and looks at me like
it's my place to follow his lead.

24:24.171 --> 24:26.256
It's the same with this renovation.

24:27.132 --> 24:29.217
My opinions do not reflect his at all.

24:32.762 --> 24:33.763
That's sounds rough.

24:35.432 --> 24:39.561
But we've decided to build
a bathroom on the second floor.

24:39.644 --> 24:41.938
- Have you heard?
- Not yet.

24:42.022 --> 24:44.274
It's happening at my request.

24:45.483 --> 24:47.986
Because we're going to live
with my mother-in-law.

24:48.612 --> 24:52.199
That bathroom will be the one place
where I can be my honest self.

24:54.784 --> 24:56.244
From the vanity to the wallpaper,

24:56.995 --> 24:59.039
I'll get to pick whatever I like.

25:00.624 --> 25:01.958
I can't wait.

25:04.586 --> 25:07.923
Well, I'll make sure to give
my full attention when building it.

25:09.007 --> 25:10.258
I appreciate that.

25:21.269 --> 25:24.189
Hey, do you want me to hide
the scar on your face?

25:24.272 --> 25:25.232
It's on the house.

25:26.066 --> 25:27.025
Well…

25:30.445 --> 25:31.821
This is fine.

25:32.447 --> 25:35.075
It won't take long. It doesn't bother you?

25:35.742 --> 25:36.660
Well…

25:40.163 --> 25:42.874
I think it's kind of cool,
like we're on the same team.

25:59.307 --> 26:02.352
- Hello?
- Mama, where are you?

26:02.435 --> 26:05.063
Let me talk to her too.

26:06.439 --> 26:09.401
I got it, I'll head home in a hurry.

26:11.778 --> 26:13.530
Yeah. Yeah, okay. See you later.

26:20.078 --> 26:23.248
All right, look, a dinosaur.

26:23.331 --> 26:26.001
- Yeah, nice.
- Hey, what is this?

26:26.084 --> 26:28.420
- Hey, Ko-chan, look at this.
- What?

26:28.503 --> 26:31.381
It says, "Second story
bathroom extension." What is this?

26:35.927 --> 26:40.098
This? Yuriha requested it,
so I had them price it out.

26:41.266 --> 26:42.309
Yuriha…

26:43.184 --> 26:45.645
You don't want to use
the same bathroom as me?

26:45.729 --> 26:47.272
No, that's not it at all.

26:47.939 --> 26:51.693
Of course not.
You're just being polite, aren't you?

26:52.485 --> 26:55.613
I get it. That makeup seems like
it takes a while to come off.

26:55.697 --> 26:59.117
Don't worry, you can take
as much time as you want.

27:01.286 --> 27:03.830
We shouldn't waste extra money on this.

27:03.913 --> 27:06.041
Let's scrap
the second story bathroom idea.

27:06.916 --> 27:07.917
I agree.

27:11.713 --> 27:14.924
I'm going to step out
to shop for groceries.

28:21.699 --> 28:24.035
Hey, show me.

28:25.453 --> 28:26.704
What?

28:27.705 --> 28:28.957
Your true face.

28:31.167 --> 28:32.210
I can't.

28:34.295 --> 28:35.630
You can show me.

28:38.925 --> 28:40.927
Oh, dear.

28:42.303 --> 28:44.264
"A window by the front door

28:44.347 --> 28:48.143
can invite bad luck
and a likelihood of an affair."

28:48.226 --> 28:49.352
So it says.

28:51.980 --> 28:56.401
Why didn't the feng shui practitioner
say so? I wonder…

29:17.505 --> 29:18.548
You're beautiful.

30:50.431 --> 30:53.184
- So about the bathroom--
- Right.

30:53.685 --> 30:56.312
- It's fine.
- Are you sure?

30:57.313 --> 30:59.023
- You're fine with it?
- Yup.

30:59.816 --> 31:00.942
I'll make it work.

31:52.619 --> 31:54.203
Wow, goldfish.

31:54.287 --> 31:55.788
So pretty. So cute.

31:55.872 --> 31:57.415
It's beautiful, isn't it?

31:57.498 --> 31:59.250
It's nice to be surrounded by life.

31:59.334 --> 32:01.669
- Everyone loves it.
- I agree.

32:01.753 --> 32:02.712
I'm glad.

32:15.266 --> 32:16.267
Please excuse me.

32:24.859 --> 32:25.735
Hello?

32:26.986 --> 32:28.696
I heard the news about Sakura.

32:29.364 --> 32:30.990
Masako told me.

32:33.326 --> 32:34.827
So what's your plan?

32:37.580 --> 32:39.499
It has nothing to do with you, Father.

32:40.667 --> 32:41.876
Come back.

32:46.547 --> 32:48.132
I'll give you another chance.

32:50.718 --> 32:52.303
Come work for the company.

32:55.223 --> 32:57.141
There won't be any more chances.

32:58.267 --> 32:59.519
Think carefully.

33:03.481 --> 33:06.025
- Understood?
- Hey--

33:17.870 --> 33:21.207
Talk to you next time. Goodbye.

33:24.627 --> 33:26.629
Another cancellation.

33:33.970 --> 33:36.681
Have we ever been this empty
at this time of the day?

33:37.724 --> 33:39.767
Maybe we should start thinking plan B?

33:40.393 --> 33:43.146
What? Yeah. We should look
for a different salon.

33:44.272 --> 33:45.773
Yeah.

33:49.277 --> 33:52.780
Why are you reneging
your sponsorship all of a sudden?

33:53.489 --> 33:56.868
I agreed because Sakura was
going to manage the business.

33:57.410 --> 34:00.621
But that's not the case.
I've called about it many times already.

34:01.372 --> 34:04.709
No, wait. I can't have this.

34:04.792 --> 34:06.919
This is not what we talked about.

34:07.628 --> 34:09.714
That's my line.

34:09.797 --> 34:11.591
Could you please rethink--

34:26.355 --> 34:27.482
Excuse me.

34:30.068 --> 34:31.194
What do you want?

34:31.903 --> 34:34.113
There's someone here to see you.

34:34.781 --> 34:37.033
A visitor? Who?

34:38.117 --> 34:39.077
That's…

34:41.662 --> 34:45.958
Nice to meet you. I am
the legal advisor for Kazama Holdings.

34:46.459 --> 34:48.044
Please call me Bando.

34:49.045 --> 34:50.213
A lawyer?

34:52.715 --> 34:55.718
I came here today
to talk about your wife, Sakura,

34:55.802 --> 34:58.679
and Haruto, the CEO's eldest son.

35:00.139 --> 35:01.307
This is perfect.

35:01.974 --> 35:03.810
He's caused me a lot of trouble.

35:04.560 --> 35:07.522
Haruto refuses to give back my wife.

35:09.107 --> 35:12.944
There's something
I'd like you to see, Mr. Hiraga.

35:36.634 --> 35:37.760
Stop!

35:41.139 --> 35:43.224
No!

35:45.268 --> 35:46.686
Stop it!

35:47.937 --> 35:48.938
No!

35:49.564 --> 35:51.941
Stop it, please!

35:55.361 --> 35:56.904
Can you confirm that

35:57.738 --> 35:59.198
this is you and your wife?
