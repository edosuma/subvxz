WEBVTT

00:02.103 --> 00:03.104
- Hank is letting me move
back into my apartment.

00:03.971 --> 00:05.139
- I was worried that hole
you were digging

00:05.173 --> 00:06.274
was gonna be too deep.

00:06.307 --> 00:08.676
- I had a lot of people
reaching in to pull me out.

00:08.709 --> 00:10.278
- Andrew will get
my bone marrow

00:10.311 --> 00:11.512
and he'll be
a new little man.

00:11.545 --> 00:14.482
That kid was dying
and that didn't seem fair.

00:14.515 --> 00:17.085
- So what if he's been
engaged before?

00:17.118 --> 00:18.752
- Just mention that maybe you
guys should push the wedding.

00:18.786 --> 00:21.255
If he gives you lip about it,
then he wants to get married.

00:21.289 --> 00:23.391
If he agrees to push it,
then he doesn't.

00:23.424 --> 00:26.160
- I was thinking maybe we should
push our wedding date back.

00:26.194 --> 00:28.196
- Okay, totally.

00:31.132 --> 00:34.168
So I've got Lomers on one side
of me saying, you know,

00:34.202 --> 00:36.337
"Let's get the money and
get the hey-hell outta here."

00:36.370 --> 00:38.572
Conway--
[chuckles]

00:38.606 --> 00:41.342
He raises his hand--
you raised your hand.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.144
He's like,
"Oh, hey, fellas--"

00:43.177 --> 00:44.712
- I don't sound like that.
- Oh, co--you do.

00:44.745 --> 00:46.214
You sound exactly
like that, Jess.

00:46.247 --> 00:48.149
So he raises his hand,
"Hey, fellas.

00:48.182 --> 00:50.618
"Uh, there's some dope here
that I think

00:50.651 --> 00:52.786
that we should liberate."

00:52.820 --> 00:54.422
Dude, liberate.
That's the best word

00:54.455 --> 00:55.556
that you could
come up with.

00:55.589 --> 00:56.590
- You're full of it, man.
- No, man.

00:56.624 --> 00:57.858
That's not what you said?
- No.

00:57.891 --> 00:59.693
- That's exactly what you said.
- That's not how I remember it.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.695
- All right, you tell Frank
your Barney Badass version.

01:01.729 --> 01:04.732
I'm gonna go liberate
my bladder.

01:09.703 --> 01:11.705
[door creaks]

01:19.247 --> 01:21.315
[phone vibrating]

01:25.619 --> 01:27.555
- This better be good.

01:27.588 --> 01:30.291
- Hey--hey, you remember
that CI Conway

01:30.324 --> 01:32.560
I was telling you about?
- Vaguely.

01:32.593 --> 01:35.429
- Jesse Conway, I busted him
on aiding and abetting.

01:35.463 --> 01:36.564
Told him I'd look
the other way

01:36.597 --> 01:38.499
if he can bring in
a bigger fish, remember?

01:38.532 --> 01:39.800
- Okay.
- All right...

01:39.833 --> 01:40.801
So he calls me tonight.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.170
He says there's this guy, Frank,

01:42.203 --> 01:44.505
who might be planning
a robbery,

01:44.538 --> 01:46.874
was looking for a wheel man.
- That's you.

01:46.907 --> 01:49.477
- That's me.
We're at a after hours bar

01:49.510 --> 01:51.279
on the corner of
Winchester and Chicago.

01:51.312 --> 01:54.148
Called Voight,
but he didn't pick up.

01:54.182 --> 01:55.115
- When's the robbery?

01:55.149 --> 01:57.418
- Uh, Frank has not
got specific just yet.

01:57.451 --> 01:58.719
- You call the on/off book

01:58.752 --> 02:00.154
so the department knows
you're working?

02:00.188 --> 02:01.689
- No, not yet.
We're just having beers, so...

02:01.722 --> 02:03.624
- All right.
Leave your phone on.

02:03.657 --> 02:06.327
Don't go anywhere.
Walk away if--

02:06.360 --> 02:10.864
[knocking]
- I gotta go, I gotta go.

02:10.898 --> 02:12.766
- Frank wants to talk to you.
- What about?

02:12.800 --> 02:14.402
- I don't know,
but move your ass, man.

02:14.435 --> 02:17.438
You're looking suspicious
in here.

02:21.842 --> 02:23.311
- Let's take a ride.

02:23.344 --> 02:24.845
- Where?
- Another bar.

02:24.878 --> 02:27.581
I'm tired of sitting here.

02:27.615 --> 02:29.283
Got a problem with that?

02:29.317 --> 02:31.185
- No.

02:39.360 --> 02:40.694
- This your truck?

02:40.728 --> 02:43.364
- Yeah, just got her.
- Can I drive?

02:43.397 --> 02:45.866
- Don't you want to see
how he drives?

02:45.899 --> 02:47.768
- Me and McCoy, we need to
get to know each other

02:47.801 --> 02:49.437
a little better
before he's in.

02:49.470 --> 02:51.472
And I feel like driving.

02:54.608 --> 02:57.511
- Yeah, well, I'm not sitting
in the middle, so...

02:57.545 --> 02:59.680
- You stay here,
order another round.

02:59.713 --> 03:02.883
We'll be back.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.918
[car alarm beeps]

Advertise your product or brand here

03:36.750 --> 03:38.986
- So what do you think?
- What?

03:39.019 --> 03:41.021
- About the truck, man.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.590
I was going to get a 4x4,

03:42.623 --> 03:45.793
but I saw this thing--
- You talk too much.

03:47.895 --> 03:50.498
- All right.
You don't want to chit-chat.

03:50.531 --> 03:51.932
That's fine.

03:51.965 --> 03:53.967
But you gotta tell me
what's going on here, man.

03:54.001 --> 03:58.506
When is this, uh, this score
supposed to go down?

03:58.539 --> 04:00.474
'Cause I'm on the verge of

04:00.508 --> 04:03.577
feeling like
I'm wasting my time here.

04:06.347 --> 04:10.751
Frank?
Whoa, whoa.

04:10.784 --> 04:13.821
What are you doing?
Hey, hey, hey.

04:13.854 --> 04:15.022
Frank!

04:24.632 --> 04:27.701
- [muffled yelling]

04:27.735 --> 04:30.738
[gunfire]

04:41.114 --> 04:43.584
- Oh, what the hell, Frank?
No!

04:43.617 --> 04:46.620
[gunfire]

04:50.824 --> 04:52.726
- Chicago P.D.!

04:52.760 --> 04:55.763
[gunfire]

05:02.670 --> 05:05.673
[heavy breathing]

05:10.778 --> 05:13.714
10-1, 10-1,
this is officer Adam Ruzek.

05:13.747 --> 05:15.583
Requesting immediate backup.

05:15.616 --> 05:17.585
Multiple shots fired
at the police

05:17.618 --> 05:20.053
at Ashland and Huron.

05:20.087 --> 05:22.590
Squad, be advised
I am a plain clothes officer.

05:22.623 --> 05:24.758
- Copy that.

05:24.792 --> 05:27.995
- Come on, Adam.

05:28.028 --> 05:29.096
Go.

05:29.129 --> 05:32.099
[intense music]

05:32.132 --> 05:40.474
*

05:56.156 --> 05:56.289
.

05:56.323 --> 05:56.957
[indistinct radio chatter]

06:00.093 --> 06:01.529
- I'm letting you
know upfront,

06:01.562 --> 06:03.997
Ruzek contacted me
before this went down.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.098
- And you told him what?

06:05.132 --> 06:07.435
- That's where
it gets fuzzy.

06:07.468 --> 06:09.136
- Hey, what's up,
Bascom?

06:09.169 --> 06:10.771
Intelligence
has got this now.

06:10.804 --> 06:14.074
- Your boy had no backup,
liquor on his breath,

06:14.107 --> 06:16.810
and the U.C.V. truck
was signed out in his name.

06:16.844 --> 06:19.413
And I hear he didn't
call it in.

06:19.447 --> 06:22.450
- We got this.

06:25.185 --> 06:27.087
Ruzek wasn't on
the on/off book?

06:27.120 --> 06:28.556
- No.

06:43.771 --> 06:45.739
- You okay?
- Yeah.

06:45.773 --> 06:48.108
Boss, I had no idea something
like this was gonna jump.

06:48.141 --> 06:50.444
- Just don't talk to any more
cops, you understand?

06:50.478 --> 06:51.645
- I understand.
- Only me.

06:51.679 --> 06:54.147
- Yes, sir.

06:54.181 --> 06:56.817
- So three bodies?
Two offenders, one civilian?

06:56.850 --> 06:58.986
- Yeah. The only thing
that makes any sense is

06:59.019 --> 07:02.456
there's a robbery going down,
Frank was in on it somehow,

07:02.490 --> 07:05.192
ambushes his crew,
takes the score for himself,

07:05.225 --> 07:06.960
'cause he knew
the exact moment

07:06.994 --> 07:08.228
that they were
gonna roll out of here.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.697
- So who'd you drop?

07:09.730 --> 07:11.198
- Offender came in
hauling ass

07:11.231 --> 07:13.834
from the back of the restaurant,
alley, I don't know,

07:13.867 --> 07:16.970
but Frank stepped over him,
hopped in the waiting car.

07:17.004 --> 07:18.806
- This Frank took shots at you?
- Yes, sir.

07:18.839 --> 07:20.974
- Frank brought in Ruzek
to be the wheel man,

07:21.008 --> 07:22.976
but it looks like he just wanted
a body and a vehicle

07:23.010 --> 07:24.978
with no relation
to the rest of the crew.

07:25.012 --> 07:27.080
Then cops spin their wheels
for weeks

07:27.114 --> 07:29.683
wondering how
he's connected.

07:29.717 --> 07:32.753
- Hmm.
What'd they take?

07:32.786 --> 07:34.087
- Well, crew was real careful
breaking in

07:34.121 --> 07:35.689
to the back door
of this restaurant.

07:35.723 --> 07:38.792
Jimmied the lock,
minimal force, no prints.

07:38.826 --> 07:39.893
Then they cut this hole
in the wall

07:39.927 --> 07:42.896
and make their way into
the jewelry store next door.

07:42.930 --> 07:45.132
- And her?

07:45.165 --> 07:47.234
- Owner of the restaurant,
one of them.

07:47.267 --> 07:48.636
Husband's been notified.

07:48.669 --> 07:50.137
He's on his way up here now
with his son.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.239
- I'm thinking something
this well planned

07:52.272 --> 07:53.106
would have accounted
for her.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.843
- Well, she comes in early
on a whim,

07:55.876 --> 07:57.978
the crew ties her up
'cause they're not killers,

07:58.011 --> 07:59.179
and Ruzek's Frank

07:59.212 --> 08:00.948
didn't subscribe
to that line of thinking.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.951
- Owners of the jewelry store?
- They're arriving now.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.987
Halstead and Lindsay
are with them.

08:12.860 --> 08:15.262
- Dude, Kev, I am
so screwed, man.

08:15.295 --> 08:18.666
- Hey, quit saying that.

08:18.699 --> 08:20.801
We'll figure it out.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.270
Okay?
- Yeah.

08:23.303 --> 08:25.505
Yeah.

08:28.976 --> 08:31.679
- Do you know how much we paid
for this security system?

08:31.712 --> 08:33.813
And they got everything.
- How much is missing?

08:33.847 --> 08:36.650
- Over $2 million.
Unbelievable.

08:36.683 --> 08:39.986
This is absolutely unbelievable.
- Door wasn't touched?

08:40.020 --> 08:41.755
- No, they cut a hole
right through the wall,

08:41.789 --> 08:43.991
and then a hole right through
the back of the safe.

08:47.661 --> 08:51.164
- They must have used the beer
to cool the blade.

08:51.198 --> 08:52.800
- What about
your alarm system?

08:52.833 --> 08:55.135
- Which one?
We got everything.

08:55.168 --> 08:58.572
Cameras, motion sensors,
we got the whole store covered.

08:58.606 --> 09:00.608
- Except if they came
through your office.

09:00.641 --> 09:03.777
- Yeah.
Except for the office.

09:03.811 --> 09:05.613
- They're sure
it's Kate next door?

09:05.646 --> 09:07.280
That's her who's dead?

09:07.314 --> 09:09.316
- I'm afraid so, ma'am.

09:15.155 --> 09:18.592
- Hey.
What's the name of this CI?

09:18.626 --> 09:19.960
- Conway,
Jesse Conway.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.662
- Where is he?

09:21.695 --> 09:22.830
- I can't get him
on the phone.

09:22.863 --> 09:24.798
I left, like, 15 messages.

09:24.832 --> 09:26.199
Mouse is trying to get
a location off it.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.669
- I'll find him.

09:28.702 --> 09:30.070
- Looking to ID the DOAs
in there.

09:30.103 --> 09:31.238
Once we do,
we'll chase down records

09:31.271 --> 09:33.240
and any known associates.

09:33.273 --> 09:34.875
- Antonio, I apologize, man.
I--

09:34.908 --> 09:36.143
- Hey, just help solve
the case.

09:36.176 --> 09:37.177
That's what you need
to worry about right now.

09:37.210 --> 09:38.912
- Are you the detectives?
- Hey, take it easy.

09:38.946 --> 09:41.048
- I want some answers.
- Mr. Sansone.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.684
He's the owner of the
restaurant, and his son, Jordan.

09:43.717 --> 09:45.385
- Why did they do this?

09:45.418 --> 09:49.256
Why did they kill
my--my--

09:49.289 --> 09:51.058
She didn't do anything
to anyone.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.260
She was--
[sobbing]

09:53.293 --> 09:54.995
- Mr. Sansone...

09:55.028 --> 09:57.397
we're going to do everything
we can to get you those answers,

09:57.430 --> 10:00.000
but right now--
- Cops never do anything.

10:00.033 --> 10:04.938
Look at everyone standing around
like this is just--just nothing.

10:04.972 --> 10:06.840
- Right now,
we need your help.

10:06.874 --> 10:09.209
All right, Officer Atwater, he'd
like to ask you some questions

10:09.242 --> 10:12.012
whenever you're ready,
all right?

10:12.045 --> 10:15.382
Thank you.

10:15.415 --> 10:17.617
- I'm really sorry.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.430
- Hey, you have a couch guy?

10:30.463 --> 10:31.999
- I don't know
what that means.

10:32.032 --> 10:33.400
- You have a guy
for everything.

10:33.433 --> 10:35.736
A construction guy,
a car guy.

10:35.769 --> 10:38.305
I need a couch guy.
- Huh.

10:38.338 --> 10:39.873
- I'm moving
back into my place.

10:39.907 --> 10:42.275
I just want a fresh start.

10:42.309 --> 10:46.213
I kind of blew through
my savings on my...sabbatical.

10:46.246 --> 10:48.982
Don't make me ask Atwater.

10:49.016 --> 10:51.051
- What's in it for me?

10:54.254 --> 10:58.458
I'll make some calls.

10:58.491 --> 11:01.228
- DOAs are Roxy Richards
and Danny Spilatro.

11:01.261 --> 11:02.896
Both have multiple runs
at Stateville

11:02.930 --> 11:04.331
for armed robbery,
burglary,

11:04.364 --> 11:05.866
and trafficking
stolen goods.

11:05.899 --> 11:07.034
And the mystery man?

11:07.067 --> 11:08.736
- Zero so far.

11:08.769 --> 11:10.437
But now that we've identified
Richards and Spilatro,

11:10.470 --> 11:12.239
we can start to flesh out
the crew they ran with.

11:12.272 --> 11:14.407
- What about the father and son
who own the restaurant?

11:14.441 --> 11:17.110
- Records are pretty clean.
I got a list of their employees.

11:17.144 --> 11:18.879
I can start running those.

11:18.912 --> 11:21.749
- And Ruzek's CI, Conway?

11:21.782 --> 11:23.150
- Uh, nothing yet.
We subpoenaed his call logs

11:23.183 --> 11:24.384
before his phone went dead.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.486
- And speaking of,
the most common call made

11:26.519 --> 11:29.957
was to an Amanda Derkos.
That is Greek, right?

11:32.993 --> 11:35.062
Not that it makes
any difference.

11:35.095 --> 11:36.329
The address is on
the south side.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.231
- Conway mentioned
a girlfriend, so...

11:38.265 --> 11:39.867
- Great.
Jay and I will take it.

11:39.900 --> 11:42.269
- I'll go with.
- No, you won't.

11:42.302 --> 11:43.771
I spoke
with Commander Fischer.

11:43.804 --> 11:45.305
He wants you to type up
an I.P.R.

11:45.338 --> 11:47.274
Full timeline
of last night's events.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.409
- All right,
and that's it, right, boss?

11:49.442 --> 11:51.879
- Said that should cover it.
- All right.

11:57.284 --> 11:58.886
- Hey, Bob.
- Burgess.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.888
- Hey, I'm gonna talk to Sarge.
- Yeah.

12:00.921 --> 12:01.989
- Hey, Sarge,
I was wondering

12:02.022 --> 12:04.191
if I could drop a couple
of slips for some comp days.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.759
- Oh, yeah?
Where are you headed?

12:05.793 --> 12:07.294
Oh, wait, wait,
let me guess.

12:07.327 --> 12:10.998
You splurged on an Airbnb
cabin out at Chain-O-Lakes

12:11.031 --> 12:14.267
and you and your high school
pals are gonna pretend to fish

12:14.301 --> 12:16.203
and play grab ass
and brag about--

12:16.236 --> 12:20.273
what is it, Burgess?

12:20.307 --> 12:22.309
- No, it's just that
he's not actually, um--

12:22.342 --> 12:23.310
- It's just not like that,
Sarge.

12:23.343 --> 12:24.511
- Like what?

12:24.544 --> 12:26.446
- I'm, uh...

12:26.479 --> 12:28.949
- He is a bone marrow match
for a kid with leukemia

12:28.982 --> 12:31.284
at his old district,
Sergeant.

12:31.318 --> 12:33.887
- You're donating?
- I am. Tomorrow.

12:33.921 --> 12:37.224
Doctor says I only need
a few days at home.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.059
- Yo, Roman, Burgess,
Voight wants you two

12:39.092 --> 12:40.060
to head to the crime scene.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.561
Interview the shop owners
at the strip mall

12:41.594 --> 12:42.896
about that jewelry store.

12:42.930 --> 12:45.899
- Yeah, of course.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.234
- Hey, Roman.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.169
- Yeah, Sarge?

12:49.202 --> 12:50.537
- I want you to know
I'm really proud

12:50.570 --> 12:52.272
of what you're doing.

12:52.305 --> 12:55.542
So you take as long as you need
and keep your vacation.

12:55.575 --> 13:00.213
That's what being a servant
to this city is all about.

13:00.247 --> 13:03.250
- Thanks, Sarge.
- Mm-hmm.

13:05.853 --> 13:08.188
- They cut a hole
right here.

13:08.221 --> 13:09.957
A foot wrong
in either direction,

13:09.990 --> 13:11.424
they set off
the motion detectors.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.460
They knew exactly
where to hit.

13:17.597 --> 13:20.600
- What?

13:20.633 --> 13:22.535
- Inside job.

13:22.569 --> 13:24.537
Kinda, sorta, m--maybe?

13:24.571 --> 13:27.374
No, the jewelry store owners
file insurance, right?

13:27.407 --> 13:29.209
And then they split
the real haul 50/50

13:29.242 --> 13:31.278
with the robbers
they contracted.

13:31.311 --> 13:32.212
- All right,
run the owners.

13:32.245 --> 13:35.415
See if anything comes up
that's out of whack.

13:35.448 --> 13:37.450
Ma'am.

13:41.288 --> 13:43.456
Hey, boss, uh,
before we get started,

13:43.490 --> 13:45.225
I'd like to get
Commander Fischer down here

13:45.258 --> 13:46.559
or at least on the phone--

13:46.593 --> 13:48.161
- Commander Fisher's
been reassigned.

13:48.195 --> 13:51.164
- Hmm.

13:51.198 --> 13:53.166
- Al, who is that?

13:53.200 --> 13:54.968
- That's a Street Deputy.

13:55.002 --> 13:58.138
Investigates all
police related shootings.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.908
Reports straight
to the Superintendent.

14:00.941 --> 14:03.210
- Who's that?

14:03.243 --> 14:05.312
- Her driver.

14:17.324 --> 14:17.457
.

14:17.490 --> 14:17.991
- Sarge?
- Come on in.

14:18.825 --> 14:21.528
Officer Adam Ruzek,
Deputy Emma Crowley.

14:21.561 --> 14:22.629
- Ma'am.
- Officer.

14:22.662 --> 14:24.864
- Have a seat.

14:27.667 --> 14:29.202
- First of all,
how are you?

14:29.236 --> 14:33.140
- I'm fine.
Fine, thanks for asking.

14:33.173 --> 14:37.277
I will admit, I, uh, feel bad.

14:37.310 --> 14:38.946
- For?

14:38.979 --> 14:41.648
- Wishing he could have
done more, like we all do.

14:44.184 --> 14:45.685
- Are you a ventriloquist?

14:45.718 --> 14:49.122
Or was that you answering
a question that I asked him?

14:49.156 --> 14:52.425
- Hmm.

14:52.459 --> 14:54.094
- Officer Ruzek,
I'll be conducting

14:54.127 --> 14:55.628
a thorough investigation.
- Yes, ma'am.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.564
- If you're not already,
you should be in contact

14:57.597 --> 14:58.498
with your F.O.P. rep.

14:58.531 --> 15:00.400
Please keep in mind
that going forward,

15:00.433 --> 15:03.270
anything you say will be
memorialized in my report.

15:03.303 --> 15:05.672
There's no taking anything back.

15:05.705 --> 15:09.309
Do not for one moment think
that the facts will not surface.

15:09.342 --> 15:11.344
- I understand.

15:11.378 --> 15:12.980
- You typing up an I.P.R.?

15:13.013 --> 15:14.614
- Yes, ma'am.
I'm about halfway through.

15:14.647 --> 15:17.517
- Good. I'll also need
your CI reliability pack

15:17.550 --> 15:20.187
and the on-going case files
you're working.

15:20.220 --> 15:23.090
Anything to cover your ass
to prove that you were working

15:23.123 --> 15:25.625
in an official police capacity,
'cause, as I understand it,

15:25.658 --> 15:27.127
you were out there
without the permission

15:27.160 --> 15:28.595
of an immediate supervisor.

15:28.628 --> 15:30.297
- Ma'am, even though
an official call

15:30.330 --> 15:31.698
to the on/off book
was not made--

15:31.731 --> 15:34.367
cops forget that
all the time, right?

15:34.401 --> 15:36.369
We had a pre-raid plan in place

15:36.403 --> 15:39.372
and the entire team
was on stand-by.

15:39.406 --> 15:43.676
- Is this a Hank Voight special?

15:43.710 --> 15:45.212
- Well, if by that you mean

15:45.245 --> 15:47.247
a pristine account
of the events,

15:47.280 --> 15:49.316
then sure, feel free
to call it that.

15:54.387 --> 15:57.557
- Get your report to me
as soon as possible.

15:57.590 --> 15:58.591
Keep working
with the case,

15:58.625 --> 16:01.161
but until you hear otherwise,
you do it in house.

16:01.194 --> 16:03.596
- Okay.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.632
- Deputy.

16:08.135 --> 16:10.137
- [clears throat]

16:14.107 --> 16:16.443
- Yes?
- Amanda Derkos?

16:16.476 --> 16:19.546
- No, that's--
what's this about?

16:19.579 --> 16:21.581
- Mom, who is it?

16:24.584 --> 16:26.419
- Moving day?

16:26.453 --> 16:27.687
- What do you want?

16:27.720 --> 16:30.423
- I think you know
what we want.

16:30.457 --> 16:31.591
- You're looking
for Jesse Conway?

16:31.624 --> 16:33.293
- Yep.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.028
- Well, I can tell you
two things.

16:35.062 --> 16:36.496
Don't know where he is,
and I don't care.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.698
- Amanda.
- Mom, please.

16:38.731 --> 16:41.068
- He's wanted in
a double homicide.

16:41.101 --> 16:42.202
- What?
- Yeah.

16:42.235 --> 16:44.304
So a little less attitude,
a little more information

16:44.337 --> 16:46.673
would be really appreciated
before we get pissed off.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.508
- Look, if I knew where he was,
I would tell you,

16:48.541 --> 16:50.310
but I don't
and that's the truth.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.112
- See, I don't think it is.

16:52.145 --> 16:53.680
Turn around,
you're under arrest.

16:53.713 --> 16:54.814
- Wait, for what?

16:54.847 --> 16:57.350
- Obstruction and impeding
an ongoing investigation.

16:57.384 --> 16:58.551
- No, you can't do that.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.553
- She can.
- Amanda, tell them.

17:00.587 --> 17:02.689
Tell them what they want
for God's sakes.

17:02.722 --> 17:05.157
He's a loser.
- I'm not messing around here.

17:05.192 --> 17:08.728
- Okay.
Okay.

17:08.761 --> 17:11.531
I'm supposed to meet Jesse
in a half hour.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.333
Laramie Motel.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.069
- Let's go.

17:20.339 --> 17:22.608
- On your feet, Conway!
Get up!

17:22.642 --> 17:24.644
You got me?
- Mm-hmm.

17:26.878 --> 17:28.115
- Turn around.

17:28.147 --> 17:29.449
[handcuffs locking]

17:29.482 --> 17:31.484
Let's go.

17:35.455 --> 17:37.290
- I mean, do you know
this lady?

17:37.324 --> 17:39.392
Because my F.O.P. rep sounded
like he swallowed a bug

17:39.426 --> 17:41.161
when I told him
Deputy Crowley was involved.

17:41.194 --> 17:42.662
- Adam, just finish
your report

17:42.695 --> 17:44.164
and leave your feelings
out of it.

17:44.197 --> 17:45.398
- All right, I'm just
trying to figure out

17:45.432 --> 17:47.567
why this is turning
into a brush fire

17:47.600 --> 17:49.769
all of a sudden.

17:49.802 --> 17:53.473
- Remember the Eight P's
from your academy training?

17:53.506 --> 17:57.144
- Yeah.
- Let's hear 'em.

17:57.177 --> 17:58.845
- Proper police planning

17:58.878 --> 18:01.381
prevents piss-poor
police performance.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.716
- Right.
You had no authorization.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.419
No backup.
And no pre-raid plan.

18:06.453 --> 18:10.123
- I called Antonio.
- And he told you what?

18:10.157 --> 18:12.892
- To stay put.
- And yet?

18:12.925 --> 18:14.361
- I had no idea
something like that--

18:14.394 --> 18:15.595
- I know that.

18:15.628 --> 18:16.729
That's the only reason

18:16.763 --> 18:19.432
I haven't kicked you
out of my unit yet.

18:19.466 --> 18:23.270
Look...the Ivory Tower is
now focused on this incident.

18:23.303 --> 18:26.406
That tends to happen
when a cop, buzzed,

18:26.439 --> 18:28.441
is riding shotgun
in a truck

18:28.475 --> 18:30.310
that goes barreling
in the side of a restaurant,

18:30.343 --> 18:34.447
and the owner's found
shot execution style.

18:34.481 --> 18:36.516
Look, Adam,
all we can do on our end

18:36.549 --> 18:40.220
is just keep bailing water
as fast as we can

18:40.253 --> 18:42.155
and wait to hear what
the superintendent's office

18:42.189 --> 18:43.423
is gonna do.

18:43.456 --> 18:44.457
- All right.
[knock on door]

18:44.491 --> 18:45.725
- Yes?
- Halstead?

18:45.758 --> 18:47.494
He's got Conway
down in the cage.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.202
- Hey, hey.
I didn't set you up.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.936
- Oh, yeah? Then why'd you run,
you son of a bitch?

18:56.969 --> 18:58.771
- 'Cause me and the cops
have always been so friendly.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.207
We're all gentlemen.
- Oh, yeah? Yeah?

19:00.240 --> 19:03.610
- Don't!
- Give me the keys.

19:03.643 --> 19:06.346
- Look, look, I know how
you guys spin this, okay?

19:06.379 --> 19:08.615
I made the introduction,
so I go down the same as Frank.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.350
- All right, good, so we don't
have to go over the specifics.

19:10.383 --> 19:12.452
- Look, Frank said
he needed a truck for a job.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.721
You're the one that told me
I was working my case off, man.

19:14.754 --> 19:15.922
Keep my eyes and ears open.

19:15.955 --> 19:18.191
You--you really think I knew
he was going to shoot people?

19:18.225 --> 19:20.460
Come on, man.
You know me.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.695
I'm a lot of things,
but I got no blood on my hands.

19:22.729 --> 19:25.732
- All right now, just tell us
what you know about Frank.

19:25.765 --> 19:27.934
- Frank Hancock.
We met in Stateville.

19:27.967 --> 19:29.469
He was in my cell block.

19:29.502 --> 19:30.603
- Cell phone number?

19:30.637 --> 19:31.971
- I dumped my phone, man.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.440
I don't know
his number anyway.

19:33.473 --> 19:35.475
He texted me where to be
and he needed a driver.

19:35.508 --> 19:36.609
Unknown number.
- Come on.

19:36.643 --> 19:37.977
Can you find him again?

19:38.010 --> 19:39.612
- Yeah, yeah.
It would take some legwork,

19:39.646 --> 19:42.782
but yeah, man, yeah.
I-I could do that for you.

19:42.815 --> 19:44.817
- Boss.

19:52.892 --> 19:54.794
We put a GPS on him.

19:54.827 --> 19:56.429
We kick him,
he sets up a meet.

19:56.463 --> 19:58.865
We bust Frank.
- Or he bolts.

19:58.898 --> 20:00.867
- We put a GPS on him,
we tell him

20:00.900 --> 20:03.536
we'll lock up his old lady
and her mom if he runs.

20:03.570 --> 20:04.737
I mean, Conway's harmless.

20:04.771 --> 20:07.640
He's not looking
for any trouble.

20:07.674 --> 20:11.378
We got dick right now.

20:11.411 --> 20:14.747
- After you get a written
and recorded statement

20:14.781 --> 20:16.416
as to his involvement
last night.

20:16.449 --> 20:17.617
You're gonna need that
either way.

20:17.650 --> 20:19.652
- All right.
Yes, sir.

20:21.788 --> 20:23.790
[exhales]

20:26.893 --> 20:30.463
- All right, Frank Hancock
was moved to Conway's cell block

20:30.497 --> 20:31.731
a month before he got out.

20:31.764 --> 20:33.300
Hancock and Spilatro

20:33.333 --> 20:35.635
went to high school together
in Wisconsin.

20:35.668 --> 20:37.770
- Armed robbery,
multiple aggravated batteries

20:37.804 --> 20:39.806
to public servants,
stole a police car,

20:39.839 --> 20:42.775
shot at a police officer...
that's all before 17.

20:42.809 --> 20:45.345
- At 23, he killed
two people in an armed robbery.

20:45.378 --> 20:47.280
- How do you kill two people
and get to walk?

20:47.314 --> 20:49.482
- They were ex-gang bangers.
Ruled mutual combatants,

20:49.516 --> 20:51.984
so he only got two years
for discharging a weapon.

20:52.018 --> 20:53.953
- Of all the people
to get a good public defender.

20:53.986 --> 20:55.087
- What I don't get is,

20:55.121 --> 20:58.358
if Hancock and Spilatro
had been friends all this time,

20:58.391 --> 21:00.026
then why did he turn on them?

21:00.059 --> 21:02.995
- Well, Hancock's parole officer
is listed as Bart Lewis.

21:03.029 --> 21:05.498
Maybe he can shed
a little light.

21:05.532 --> 21:06.899
- You and Halstead
check it out.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.435
- All right.
How's Ruzek?

21:08.468 --> 21:10.370
- Go talk
to the parole officer.

21:12.572 --> 21:14.774
- Okay.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.008
- Now if you leave
the city limits--

21:16.042 --> 21:18.911
- Hey, hey, I won't.
- Hey! Do you mind?

21:18.945 --> 21:21.314
- Look, I'll come through
for you, man.

21:21.348 --> 21:23.650
Believe me, I want nothing more
than to make this right.

21:23.683 --> 21:25.051
So I can go
be with my girl,

21:25.084 --> 21:27.787
leave all this craziness
behind me.

21:27.820 --> 21:30.723
- All right, look,
Conway...

21:30.757 --> 21:32.825
We both got a lot
to lose here, you know?

21:32.859 --> 21:37.364
- Mm-hmm.
- So just get it done.

21:37.397 --> 21:38.665
- We are good to go.

21:38.698 --> 21:39.766
- All right.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.868
Here.

21:41.901 --> 21:44.871
Go find Hancock.
- See ya.

21:44.904 --> 21:47.340
[door opens and closes]

21:47.374 --> 21:49.742
- He'll be all right.

21:49.776 --> 21:51.778
- Yeah.

21:53.746 --> 21:56.616
- I love Donna and Mark.
Nothing bad to say about them.

21:56.649 --> 21:58.485
I just hope they don't close
after this.

21:58.518 --> 22:01.053
They, uh, helped me on
a Christmas present once.

22:01.087 --> 22:02.054
Went way out of their way.

22:02.088 --> 22:04.357
- You see any people
lurking around their store?

22:04.391 --> 22:05.892
Maybe someone
who didn't look right.

22:05.925 --> 22:07.494
- No, nothing.

22:07.527 --> 22:09.028
- You've been very helpful.

22:09.061 --> 22:11.598
- Sure.

22:11.631 --> 22:15.902
- Sometimes you let up the rug,
it's nothing but spic-and-span.

22:15.935 --> 22:18.438
- Hey, you need a ride
to Med tomorrow?

22:18.471 --> 22:19.772
- I was gonna ask
my neighbor.

22:19.806 --> 22:20.907
- And not your partner?

22:20.940 --> 22:22.609
I should hit you
upside the head right now.

22:22.642 --> 22:24.076
I'm taking you.

22:24.110 --> 22:25.912
- Aww, you care.

22:25.945 --> 22:28.548
- Of course I do.

22:28.581 --> 22:29.982
- Talk to Ruzek at all?

22:30.016 --> 22:31.918
Hell of a spot
he got himself into.

22:31.951 --> 22:34.621
- Yeah, there's no way
he could have avoided it.

22:34.654 --> 22:38.491
- I was talking about him
failing your push test.

22:38.525 --> 22:41.928
- God, please.
One crisis at a time.

22:41.961 --> 22:43.095
- So the wedding's off?

22:43.129 --> 22:45.031
- No, it's not.
It just--you know,

22:45.064 --> 22:48.468
it's pushed.
We're fine.

22:48.501 --> 22:50.570
- Hey!

22:50.603 --> 22:52.905
Hey! You guys caught the guys
who did this yet?

22:52.939 --> 22:54.441
- We're working on it.
- Doesn't look like it

22:54.474 --> 22:55.642
from where I'm standing.

22:55.675 --> 22:57.176
Doesn't look like anybody's
doing anything.

22:57.209 --> 22:58.177
- I promise you
that we are, sir.

22:58.210 --> 23:00.179
- My mom is dead.

23:00.212 --> 23:02.849
My dad is wrecked.
Our restaurant is gone.

23:02.882 --> 23:04.183
- All right, just calm down.
- And you people are moving

23:04.216 --> 23:05.518
like snails.

23:05.552 --> 23:06.819
The killers are out there
laughing

23:06.853 --> 23:08.721
while you've got your thumbs
up your asses.

23:08.755 --> 23:09.922
- Kid, I understand
your grief,

23:09.956 --> 23:11.658
but I promise
if you don't calm down,

23:11.691 --> 23:14.060
I'm gonna make this
unpleasant.

23:14.093 --> 23:16.128
- Fine.
Fine.

23:16.162 --> 23:18.164
You don't do something,
I will.

23:26.673 --> 23:29.141
[engine starts]
- I'll call Voight.

23:33.946 --> 23:34.080
.

23:34.113 --> 23:34.413
- Yes, sir.

23:35.181 --> 23:37.216
Okay, yes, will do.

23:37.249 --> 23:40.453
Voight wants us
to sit on the kid.

23:46.158 --> 23:47.760
- Sarge.

23:47.794 --> 23:51.063
This has to be hand delivered
to the Street Deputy ASAP.

23:51.097 --> 23:52.899
I'd do it myself, but I can't
leave the house, so...

23:52.932 --> 23:54.133
- I'll get it there.

23:54.166 --> 23:55.868
- I appreciate it.

23:55.902 --> 23:57.203
- Hot water, huh?

23:57.236 --> 23:58.938
- [chuckles]
Yeah.

23:58.971 --> 24:01.474
To be honest,
I don't totally get it.

24:01.508 --> 24:03.175
After all the things
we've done in Intelligence,

24:03.209 --> 24:04.677
all the things
we get away with,

24:04.711 --> 24:06.779
Ivory Tower wants to break
my balls over this?

24:06.813 --> 24:10.082
I mean--
- Listen.

24:10.116 --> 24:14.621
You know what Moses had
before he parted the Red Sea?

24:14.654 --> 24:15.622
- What?

24:15.655 --> 24:18.024
- Permission
from his supervisor.

24:18.057 --> 24:22.061
See, that way
everyone's ass was covered.

24:35.542 --> 24:37.109
- Pullman Pets?

24:37.143 --> 24:39.879
What is he,
picking up some dog food?

24:39.912 --> 24:43.616
- At least it's not
a pawn store to pick up a gun.

24:43.650 --> 24:46.085
- Doesn't make sense.

24:46.118 --> 24:48.254
- Grieving never does.

24:48.287 --> 24:51.190
One minute, you're ready
to rip the world to shreds,

24:51.223 --> 24:53.593
the next you find yourself
standing in the grocery store

24:53.626 --> 24:54.894
wondering how
you got there.

24:54.927 --> 24:57.830
Trust me, I know.
- Yeah?

24:57.864 --> 25:01.568
- My mom passed, I didn't know
down from up for months, but...

25:01.601 --> 25:03.770
better days now, right?

25:03.803 --> 25:05.805
- Sure.

25:07.807 --> 25:09.642
All right,
let's go.

25:09.676 --> 25:11.644
[engine starts]

25:11.678 --> 25:16.048
- What about
something like this?

25:16.082 --> 25:19.552
- I'm the last guy you should
ask about decorative furniture.

25:19.586 --> 25:21.621
I'm a function
over form man.

25:21.654 --> 25:23.189
- What does that mean?

25:23.222 --> 25:25.024
- It means if it's comfy,

25:25.057 --> 25:27.560
then I don't care
what it looks like.

25:27.594 --> 25:30.062
- Hmm.

25:30.096 --> 25:34.100
- You know, we could
always give one a test drive.

25:34.133 --> 25:36.669
- Test out the function?

25:36.703 --> 25:39.806
- I hope we're talking
about the same thing.

25:39.839 --> 25:41.708
- Afternoon.

25:41.741 --> 25:43.876
Heard you had some questions
about a parolee of mine?

25:43.910 --> 25:45.645
- Yeah, Frank Hancock.

25:45.678 --> 25:48.180
- I've been
expecting this one.

25:51.818 --> 25:53.920
- Antisocial personality
disorder.

25:53.953 --> 25:55.722
They got him
on lithium carbonate,

25:55.755 --> 25:57.790
Dilantin,
and Clozapine.

25:57.824 --> 25:59.258
- Well, now we know
who would be crazy enough

25:59.291 --> 26:01.227
to drive a truck
into a restaurant.

26:01.260 --> 26:03.362
- How does a guy like this
ever get released from prison?

26:03.395 --> 26:06.599
- I just take the cases
that are handed to me.

26:06.633 --> 26:08.167
When Hancock got out,

26:08.200 --> 26:09.435
he needed to get a job.

26:09.468 --> 26:14.774
I hooked him up with an actual
graveyard shift at a cemetery.

26:14.807 --> 26:16.643
Here's the number.

26:16.676 --> 26:18.678
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

26:18.711 --> 26:22.649
- Hey.
Got a second?

26:22.682 --> 26:24.250
- More than most people
around here.

26:24.283 --> 26:27.286
[laughing]

26:29.822 --> 26:32.324
- You know this guy?

26:32.358 --> 26:35.662
- Oh, yeah.
- He works here?

26:35.695 --> 26:37.997
- Yeah, he showed up,
worked one shift.

26:38.030 --> 26:40.166
Told the foreman
to punch in and out for him,

26:40.199 --> 26:41.400
and if he didn't,
he was gonna put him

26:41.433 --> 26:43.703
in the wrong end
of one of these holes.

26:43.736 --> 26:45.137
I never saw him again.

26:45.171 --> 26:47.306
- Know where we can find him?

26:47.339 --> 26:49.308
- No.
But you know what?

26:49.341 --> 26:52.712
He was talking to Jimenez
about buying his car.

26:52.745 --> 26:53.913
And I see Jimenez pull up

26:53.946 --> 26:55.281
in the lot in
an old pick-up today,

26:55.314 --> 26:59.285
so maybe he did.

26:59.318 --> 27:02.321
- All right.

27:02.354 --> 27:04.857
- Hancock's driving
a '93 Ford Bronco.

27:04.891 --> 27:07.026
- I'll Sound Ex the previous
owner and get a license plate.

27:07.059 --> 27:09.228
- Get an investigative alert
and a BOLO out on the vehicle.

27:09.261 --> 27:11.330
Broadcast an all call message
over all the zones.

27:11.363 --> 27:14.200
- Yes, sir.
- Hey, Ruzek.

27:14.233 --> 27:15.835
What's the latest
from Conway?

27:15.868 --> 27:17.003
- He made a few calls.
He's zeroing in

27:17.036 --> 27:18.204
on a meeting with Hancock.

27:18.237 --> 27:20.239
- Good.

27:27.346 --> 27:29.749
- Hey, hey.
A traffic cam just picked up

27:29.782 --> 27:31.818
our '93 Ford Bronco
in West Town.

27:31.851 --> 27:33.019
Damen and Hubbard.

27:33.052 --> 27:35.054
- Get Lindsay and Halstead
to respond.

27:35.087 --> 27:38.090
- Yes, sir.
- Pull up Conway's location.

27:49.135 --> 27:52.371
- Car is empty.

27:52.404 --> 27:54.907
- Maybe he's up
in one of these buildings.

27:54.941 --> 27:56.943
[phone buzzing]

27:56.976 --> 27:58.410
- What's up, Mouse?
- Hey.

27:58.444 --> 28:01.047
I just pinged Conway's GPS.
- Yeah?

28:01.080 --> 28:03.449
- Yeah. He's 100 feet
in front of you,

28:03.482 --> 28:05.852
just before the tracks.

28:10.489 --> 28:11.824
- Where is he, Mouse?

28:11.858 --> 28:14.160
- You should be
right on top of him.

28:14.193 --> 28:16.228
- Come on, man.

28:16.262 --> 28:19.832
Please, please.

28:22.234 --> 28:24.236
- Hey, hey, hey.

28:28.875 --> 28:29.942
You got me?

28:48.928 --> 28:49.061
.

28:49.095 --> 28:49.695
- I got him killed,
Antonio.

28:51.530 --> 28:53.833
- Let's just get the guy
that did this, okay?

28:53.866 --> 28:55.968
You start chasing demons
in the mirror,

28:56.002 --> 28:57.236
instead of the ones
on the streets,

28:57.269 --> 28:59.872
you're no good
to anybody.

28:59.906 --> 29:02.875
- Yeah.

29:02.909 --> 29:04.476
- He ran around
doing mundane chores.

29:04.510 --> 29:06.378
Cooling off, I guess.
- Hmm.

29:06.412 --> 29:08.280
He blew himself out
yelling at us, if you ask me.

29:08.314 --> 29:10.116
- Or he spotted
our patrol car tailing him

29:10.149 --> 29:11.984
and decided against
going all Death Wish.

29:12.018 --> 29:13.319
Johnson and Benioff
are watching him

29:13.352 --> 29:15.087
in an unmarked car now,
just in case.

29:15.121 --> 29:16.022
- All right, thanks.

29:16.055 --> 29:18.290
Hey, anything on
those jewelry store owners?

29:18.324 --> 29:19.491
- Mm, nothing.

29:19.525 --> 29:21.560
Married 30 years,
no financial issues,

29:21.593 --> 29:23.362
800 credit score,
no criminal record,

29:23.395 --> 29:24.831
not even a moving violation.

29:24.864 --> 29:26.065
- Bring 'em in anyway.

29:26.098 --> 29:28.400
- And I got the subpoenaed
phone records on the dump phone

29:28.434 --> 29:30.336
found on the DOA,
Roxy Richards.

29:30.369 --> 29:32.371
He had a few calls
to the other DOA, Spilatro,

29:32.404 --> 29:35.441
and then a bunch of calls
to a store called Pullman Pets.

29:35.474 --> 29:38.110
- Hey, Pullman--
Pullman Pets.

29:38.144 --> 29:40.479
Jordan Sansone
was in there today.

29:40.512 --> 29:43.349
- Inside man?
- Wasn't his mom killed, though?

29:43.382 --> 29:45.451
- Well, maybe something
went sideways.

29:45.484 --> 29:47.887
- Well, get Jordan in here
and let's find out.

29:47.920 --> 29:50.056
And run the priors
on this pet store owner.

29:50.089 --> 29:51.858
Let's make a connection.
- Yeah, I'm on it.

29:51.891 --> 29:54.193
- Al, you take Atwater,
you head down there.

29:54.226 --> 29:56.428
We learn anything
on our end, we'll call.

29:56.462 --> 29:58.330
Nice.
- Let's go.

29:58.364 --> 30:00.466
- Yeah.

30:00.499 --> 30:02.534
Hey.
- I'm good.

30:11.878 --> 30:13.279
- Adam.

30:13.312 --> 30:14.613
- Yeah?

30:14.646 --> 30:17.984
- Jesse Conway's girlfriend?

30:18.017 --> 30:19.418
She's downstairs.

30:25.524 --> 30:27.960
- Thanks.

30:40.206 --> 30:42.474
- She's been notified.

30:49.448 --> 30:52.118
[taps on doorframe]

30:52.151 --> 30:54.086
- I'm Adam.

30:54.120 --> 30:58.190
- I know who you are.

30:58.224 --> 31:00.426
- Look, I don't know
what to say here.

31:00.459 --> 31:03.362
I-I'm sorry.

31:03.395 --> 31:06.165
- He trusted you.

31:18.410 --> 31:21.013
- [breathes deeply]

31:21.047 --> 31:23.282
[doorbell rings]

31:23.315 --> 31:26.485
- Hey, you Ben Forsick?
- Yeah.

31:26.518 --> 31:28.955
- How do you know Roxy Richards?
- I don't.

31:28.988 --> 31:30.656
- Well, we got
your phone records,

31:30.689 --> 31:33.692
so we know
you've had priors.

31:33.725 --> 31:35.127
Fencing stolen goods
through here.

31:35.161 --> 31:36.929
Using this pet store
as a front.

31:36.963 --> 31:38.230
- You got the wrong guy,
gents.

31:38.264 --> 31:39.265
I mean, yeah,
I've got some priors,

31:39.298 --> 31:40.432
but that was ten years ago.

31:40.466 --> 31:42.434
- Where does Jordan Sansone
fit in?

31:42.468 --> 31:43.602
- You're not hearing me.

31:43.635 --> 31:45.437
- I know you know something.

31:45.471 --> 31:47.940
Do yourself a favor
and tell me what you know.

31:47.974 --> 31:50.609
- Then you need to talk
with my attorney.

31:50.642 --> 31:52.678
I've got his card
right here.

31:52.711 --> 31:56.515
- You mind getting the door, Al?

31:56.548 --> 31:59.518
Now, one last time,
lay it out there straight.

31:59.551 --> 32:02.454
- Look, I'm telling you
on my mother's eye--

32:02.488 --> 32:04.690
[grunting]

32:04.723 --> 32:06.425
- Four people are dead.

32:06.458 --> 32:08.160
[water gurgling]

32:08.194 --> 32:10.596
Where's Frank?

32:13.265 --> 32:14.500
- Oh, God, okay.
- You want to talk?

32:14.533 --> 32:17.036
- Okay, okay, okay.
- You want to talk?

32:17.069 --> 32:17.936
- Yeah, Mouse?

32:17.970 --> 32:20.406
Yeah, I got a number
for you to ping, bro.

32:20.439 --> 32:23.142
You ready?
- On it.

32:23.175 --> 32:25.711
- Hey, where's Sansone?

32:25.744 --> 32:27.980
- Uniform that's posted up
outside of his parent's house

32:28.014 --> 32:29.481
said Sansone
hasn't shown yet.

32:29.515 --> 32:31.517
We, uh, put an alarm out
on his car.

32:35.087 --> 32:40.092
[tires screeching]

32:43.329 --> 32:45.998
- You the manager?
- Yeah. What's this now?

32:46.032 --> 32:47.599
- Which room?

32:47.633 --> 32:51.070
- 211.
- Upstairs.

33:06.152 --> 33:08.154
- Go.

33:14.226 --> 33:16.228
- Go.

33:22.101 --> 33:25.704
- [grunting]

33:25.737 --> 33:28.607
- Stupid kid.
Doing that to me!

33:33.312 --> 33:33.479
.

33:33.512 --> 33:34.780
[gunfire]
- [whimpering]

33:39.318 --> 33:41.320
- Antonio, he's running!

33:44.456 --> 33:46.192
- No one was supposed
to die.

33:46.225 --> 33:47.559
They promised me.

33:47.593 --> 33:49.595
They promised.

33:57.136 --> 33:58.537
[gun thuds]

34:08.580 --> 34:12.618
- [grunting]

34:15.887 --> 34:18.456
- We got him.
Field behind the building.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.837
- So I want to know...

34:31.870 --> 34:35.141
why'd you ambush
your friends?

34:35.174 --> 34:38.610
- They were going to
cut me out, so...

34:38.643 --> 34:40.812
- They told you that?

34:40.846 --> 34:44.216
- No.
But, uh,

34:44.250 --> 34:48.286
I just had that feeling,
you know?

34:48.320 --> 34:50.322
So...

34:57.596 --> 35:00.199
- I owed money to this dealer.

35:00.232 --> 35:01.700
He made threats.

35:01.733 --> 35:05.837
I had to come up
with the money, period.

35:05.871 --> 35:07.606
- And you didn't know
what kind of people

35:07.639 --> 35:10.142
you were getting
into bed with?

35:10.176 --> 35:12.678
- No one was supposed
to be there.

35:12.711 --> 35:16.548
And they said no one
was going to get hurt.

35:16.582 --> 35:19.385
But I didn't know my mom
landed this catering job

35:19.418 --> 35:21.587
and went in way early.

35:21.620 --> 35:25.357
I didn't know.
[sobbing]

35:25.391 --> 35:27.559
I swear,
I didn't know.

35:27.593 --> 35:31.597
[sobbing]

35:33.499 --> 35:35.867
I swear I didn't know.

35:38.204 --> 35:41.207
- How long will he be
looking at?

35:41.240 --> 35:42.241
- [exhales deeply]

35:42.274 --> 35:44.276
His sentence
has already started.

35:44.310 --> 35:47.179
Believe me.

35:47.213 --> 35:50.916
- [sobbing]

35:50.949 --> 35:53.151
- I know.

35:55.654 --> 35:57.656
[indistinct chatter]

35:57.689 --> 36:00.792
- Oh, look at you.
Such a gentleman.

36:00.826 --> 36:03.962
Whatever.

36:03.995 --> 36:06.332
- Sean, Kim.

36:06.365 --> 36:08.267
- Hi.
- What is it?

36:08.300 --> 36:10.702
- Andrew's developed
acute anemia.

36:10.736 --> 36:12.838
His red blood cell count
has dropped to lower levels

36:12.871 --> 36:15.574
than are safe to perform
the operation.

36:15.607 --> 36:17.876
- So we reschedule it?

36:17.909 --> 36:19.711
- No, we cancel it.

36:19.745 --> 36:21.980
There's no reason to make him
go through the pain of this.

36:22.013 --> 36:23.915
I've spoken with
the boy's mother

36:23.949 --> 36:27.386
and I've recommended
that Andrew be taken off his--

36:41.867 --> 36:45.471
- [sobbing]

36:57.349 --> 36:59.451
- Ruzek...

36:59.485 --> 37:02.454
He keeps me up at night.

37:02.488 --> 37:04.723
- All the time.

37:06.858 --> 37:08.460
- I don't know what's
going on over here,

37:08.494 --> 37:12.298
but these two
need a round on me.

37:12.331 --> 37:13.832
- Coming right up.
- Thank you, Sharon.

37:13.865 --> 37:15.901
- Oh, okay.
- Thank you, Sharon.

37:15.934 --> 37:18.404
- All right.
Cheers.

37:18.437 --> 37:20.639
- Cheers.

37:20.672 --> 37:22.007
- Hey.

37:22.040 --> 37:23.575
Would you rather be
sitting here talking about

37:23.609 --> 37:26.044
how you gotta fix the deck
at your lake house

37:26.077 --> 37:29.381
or some rubbish?

37:29.415 --> 37:30.482
You would not.

37:30.516 --> 37:36.355
Thank God you and I
still get to do what we love.

37:37.723 --> 37:39.625
Bumps and all.

37:46.097 --> 37:50.302
- Almost there.
- Yeah?

37:50.336 --> 37:53.972
Here?
- Yeah, right there.

37:54.005 --> 37:55.741
- Oh, my God.

37:55.774 --> 37:57.776
- Ah!

37:57.809 --> 37:59.611
- Now the real question is...

37:59.645 --> 38:01.913
function or form?

38:01.947 --> 38:03.715
- Well, it looks cool.

38:03.749 --> 38:06.585
- Yeah,
but does it feel good?

38:06.618 --> 38:09.655
- Well...

38:09.688 --> 38:12.758
no time like the present.

38:16.862 --> 38:19.598
[exhales deeply]

38:19.631 --> 38:21.467
Huh?
- I think you actually got both.

38:21.500 --> 38:22.868
- Function and form.

38:22.901 --> 38:24.403
- Like me.

38:24.436 --> 38:26.605
I have rugged good looks
plus a razor sharp mind.

38:26.638 --> 38:29.675
It's rare,
but when it comes together--

38:35.614 --> 38:38.384
- That was for never
giving up on me.

38:47.025 --> 38:49.595
What was that for?

38:49.628 --> 38:52.330
- It's 'cause I wanted
to kiss you.

39:08.013 --> 39:09.948
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

39:09.981 --> 39:12.451
- You're still here.
- Yep.

39:12.484 --> 39:13.852
Martinez called in sick,

39:13.885 --> 39:15.754
so I got stuck
doing another tour.

39:15.787 --> 39:17.789
- Yeah, of course.

39:21.627 --> 39:24.062
- Hey, um...

39:24.095 --> 39:26.532
uh, Platt is tight
with a lieutenant

39:26.565 --> 39:27.566
in the chief's office.

39:27.599 --> 39:29.501
He says that you're looking
at a written reprimand

39:29.535 --> 39:32.137
and maybe a day suspension,
but maybe, so...

39:32.170 --> 39:34.940
you'll be okay.

39:34.973 --> 39:38.009
- Yeah.
We'll see.

39:41.747 --> 39:44.483
- Hey...Adam.

39:44.516 --> 39:45.751
- I don't know.

39:45.784 --> 39:47.686
I got on this job
to save lives.

39:47.719 --> 39:49.755
- Baby, listen to me.

39:49.788 --> 39:53.024
That psycho was going through
with that job regardless.

39:53.058 --> 39:55.894
And if you weren't there, we
would have no idea who he was,

39:55.927 --> 39:58.096
and he would still
be out there doing,

39:58.129 --> 40:01.433
I mean, God knows what.

40:04.936 --> 40:08.774
- My bad, bro.
Uh, boss wants to see you.

40:08.807 --> 40:11.142
And the Street Deputy's
with him.

40:13.645 --> 40:14.980
- Thanks, Kev.
- Yeah, bro.

40:15.013 --> 40:17.015
- Thanks.

40:20.185 --> 40:22.187
All right.

40:30.629 --> 40:32.631
- I've been reviewing
your team's activities

40:32.664 --> 40:33.832
over the past six months.

40:33.865 --> 40:35.867
You certainly have
an aggressive unit.

40:35.901 --> 40:38.904
- Yeah.
Thank you.

40:41.573 --> 40:43.875
- Adam.
- [chuckles]

40:43.909 --> 40:46.444
I know I'm in trouble when
you call me by my first name.

40:49.515 --> 40:51.483
- Officer Ruzek,
I'm here to inform you

40:51.517 --> 40:53.018
that you've been stripped
of your police powers

40:53.051 --> 40:55.887
until the Chief
determines your future.

40:55.921 --> 40:57.689
In the meantime,
you can continue to work

40:57.723 --> 41:00.559
out of this unit,
but with an empty holster.

41:00.592 --> 41:01.993
And by the way,

41:02.027 --> 41:05.030
I could have had you answering
311 non-emergency calls

41:05.063 --> 41:07.966
out of OEMC,
but since your dad is a cop,

41:07.999 --> 41:09.568
I took that
into consideration.

41:13.672 --> 41:16.775
- It's a shame.

41:16.808 --> 41:19.611
The cops who do nothing
can never get in trouble.

41:19.645 --> 41:22.013
Wouldn't you say,
Deputy?

41:30.789 --> 41:33.892
- Hey, boss.
- Hmm?

41:33.925 --> 41:37.796
- Am I cooked?

41:37.829 --> 41:39.831
- I don't know, kid.
