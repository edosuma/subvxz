<i>I'll tell you the story of my journey.</i>

01:22.291 --> 01:24.908
<i>Where I went, how I got there,</i>

01:25.794 --> 01:27.660
<i>and what I saw along the way.</i>

01:29.381 --> 01:32.215
<i>I thought I was going to change the world.</i>

01:33.510 --> 01:36.924
<i>But, of course,</i>
<i>it was the world that changed me.</i>

01:37.681 --> 01:39.968
We need a doctor! Please help!

01:40.100 --> 01:41.887
- You can't be in here.
- Please!

01:43.478 --> 01:45.970
- We need help.
- Here. This way. This way.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.063
- They can't be in here!
- It's all right.

01:48.650 --> 01:51.142
- What happened to him?
- Drill bit broke loose.

01:51.278 --> 01:53.691
- Hang on, Sam.
- Hold on. You're gonna be all right.

01:53.822 --> 01:56.109
- You'll be all right, Sam.
- Help me, please.

01:56.241 --> 01:57.903
- They don't belong here.
- What are you doing?

01:58.035 --> 02:00.027
- He's bleeding to death.
- He can't be in here!

02:00.162 --> 02:01.118
Help me!

02:01.246 --> 02:03.363
- What is going on?
- Doctor, he has a deep puncture.

02:03.498 --> 02:05.239
This man is in the wrong hospital.

02:05.375 --> 02:06.991
He doesn't have time for the right one.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.914
- Get him out of here. Quickly!
- He's bleeding to death!

02:10.047 --> 02:12.004
- He's bleeding!
- This isn't right!

02:13.634 --> 02:15.626
Move it! Move it! Get him out!

02:17.846 --> 02:20.213
- What is wrong with you?
- Take him down the back stairs.

02:20.349 --> 02:21.385
This way.

02:36.156 --> 02:40.992
<i>It gives me great pleasure</i>
<i>to introduce our speaker and friend,</i>

02:41.119 --> 02:42.530
<i>Dr Jude Gresham.</i>

02:48.627 --> 02:49.663
Thank you.

02:50.879 --> 02:57.501
Eastern Anatolia is a rugged country.
Its people are poor but hard-working.

03:00.097 --> 03:05.309
For them, modern medicine
is a revolutionary concept.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.392
You might have changed out of that uniform.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.638
- Sorry. I didn't have time.
- Shh!

03:09.773 --> 03:13.016
That is why the work of
the American Mission Hospital in Van

03:13.151 --> 03:15.017
is so vitally important.

03:15.946 --> 03:17.403
For many people in the region,

03:17.531 --> 03:20.148
our hospital offers
the only medical care available.

03:21.201 --> 03:24.444
People come from hundreds of miles around.

03:25.872 --> 03:28.455
And the only reason
we are able to provide for them

03:28.583 --> 03:32.668
is because of generous donations from
open-hearted Christians like yourselves.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.627
There are impediments, of course.

03:37.592 --> 03:43.964
Eastern Anatolia can be a place of
unspeakable violence and transgression.

03:46.226 --> 03:49.719
But it is also a place of fierce spirit.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.848
And the people who have survived there...

04:07.706 --> 04:11.666
When I first came to Van
as a newly graduated doctor,

04:12.919 --> 04:15.457
my plan was to stay a year, do my service,

04:15.589 --> 04:18.673
and then come back to the States
and open a prosperous practice.

04:19.885 --> 04:21.421
Well, that was eight years ago.

04:23.597 --> 04:26.055
I didn't intend for it to happen,

04:26.183 --> 04:30.427
but once I got to know these people
and live among them,

04:30.562 --> 04:32.394
I knew I would never leave.

04:36.318 --> 04:38.401
Thank you.

04:50.957 --> 04:53.791
- Sounds like a whirlwind.
- It has been a whirlwind.

04:53.919 --> 04:56.002
I've been visiting hospitals
in various cities,

04:56.129 --> 04:58.746
catching up on the latest advancements
in modern medicine.

04:58.882 --> 05:02.341
It's true. Medical science
has been making amazing advances.

05:03.220 --> 05:06.088
If only we could advance
the thinking of the doctors.

05:06.223 --> 05:08.431
- Lillie...
- How do you mean, miss?

05:09.017 --> 05:11.805
Yesterday, a man was turned away
from the hospital where I work

05:11.937 --> 05:14.725
because his skin was the wrong colour.

05:14.856 --> 05:17.473
Dr Gresham, I have to apologise
for our daughter.

05:17.609 --> 05:20.693
I assure you, Miss Rowe, no one has ever
been turned away from our hospital

05:20.821 --> 05:24.110
due to the colour of their skin
or their religious beliefs.

05:24.241 --> 05:27.029
That would be against
everything we believe in.

05:29.329 --> 05:33.619
Dr Gresham, I'd like to show you something.

05:43.927 --> 05:45.418
Isn't it beautiful?

05:47.556 --> 05:50.640
- It's very handsome.
- It was my brother's.

05:52.227 --> 05:54.935
He was training to be a doctor when he died.

05:55.063 --> 05:58.852
- I'm sorry, Miss Rowe.
- I want to donate it to your mission.

06:00.068 --> 06:02.526
- Hm...
- You can use a truck, can't you?

06:02.654 --> 06:05.442
Of course. And I appreciate the offer.

06:05.574 --> 06:09.659
But there's no way
to get this to our hospital.

06:10.745 --> 06:11.781
Why not?

06:11.913 --> 06:15.031
Well, for one thing, the railroad
only goes a third of the way

06:15.166 --> 06:19.035
and the roads are just rough trails
cut through the mountains.

06:19.170 --> 06:20.752
Goat paths, really.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.590
I'll find a way to get it there.

06:28.597 --> 06:30.259
I want it to serve a purpose.

06:31.308 --> 06:34.517
Are you sure it isn't you that wants
to serve a purpose, Miss Rowe?

06:34.644 --> 06:38.979
I suppose I'm looking for something,
some way to contribute.

06:41.526 --> 06:44.109
Well, whatever that is,
I'm sure you'll find it.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.155
I hope we meet again one day.

06:53.038 --> 06:54.324
I hope so too.

07:28.156 --> 07:30.239
Europe's on the verge of war.

07:30.367 --> 07:33.610
There's no guarantee that the truck
or the medical supplies

07:33.745 --> 07:36.283
would ever reach Dr Gresham's hospital.

07:37.999 --> 07:40.116
What if I took them myself?

07:41.378 --> 07:42.494
What do you mean?

07:42.629 --> 07:45.246
Sail to Istanbul and make sure
they get the rest of the way.

07:46.091 --> 07:48.253
- What, deliver them in person?
- Yes.

07:48.385 --> 07:50.627
Lillie, your heart's in the right place,

07:50.762 --> 07:52.924
but this journey, it's far too dangerous.

07:53.056 --> 07:56.265
Oh, it's unimaginable. Out of the question.

07:57.310 --> 08:00.894
A young woman on her own
in that part of the world.

08:01.022 --> 08:02.058
No.

08:06.111 --> 08:07.818
I've already made the arrangements.

08:09.239 --> 08:11.481
- You did what?
- I've already booked the passage

08:11.616 --> 08:13.699
for myself and the supplies.

08:14.786 --> 08:16.823
I used my inheritance from Grandmother.

08:16.955 --> 08:20.414
- Lillie, it's not a matter of money.
- You're 23 years old.

08:21.167 --> 08:24.751
All your friends are married
and raising families.

08:24.879 --> 08:27.542
Now, up until now, we've indulged your whims.

08:27.674 --> 08:30.587
- Whims?
- Nursing school.

08:30.719 --> 08:32.255
Your work with the poor.

08:32.386 --> 08:36.301
Lillie, it's time to settle down, not
run away to the other side of the world.

08:36.433 --> 08:39.926
I'm sorry, dear.
We cannot possibly allow this.

08:40.562 --> 08:42.019
Absolutely not.

08:43.898 --> 08:45.810
I love you both.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.065
But this is something I have to do.

08:51.531 --> 08:54.023
Lillie? Lillie?

10:33.383 --> 10:34.794
- Miss Rowe?
- Hm-hm?

10:34.926 --> 10:37.885
- Your goods will be unloaded shortly.
- Thank you, Thomas.

11:08.042 --> 11:09.078
Sir?

11:09.210 --> 11:10.746
Sir? Excuse me?

11:12.505 --> 11:14.542
Ignore him. Keep moving.

11:15.383 --> 11:16.419
I'm sorry?

11:17.177 --> 11:21.262
Special "welcome to Istanbul" greeting.
He drops the brush, you pick it up,

11:21.389 --> 11:24.427
and suddenly you're getting the most
expensive shoeshine in the world.

11:24.559 --> 11:27.097
I'm sorry, sir. I'm all right, thank you.

11:32.859 --> 11:34.350
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

11:34.485 --> 11:37.023
- Are you American?
- Yes. I...

11:37.155 --> 11:42.025
I wanted to see the mosque.
Could you tell me how to get there?

11:42.160 --> 11:46.120
Well, I could.
It might be easier if I just show you.

11:46.247 --> 11:50.161
Come on. You don't want to miss the most
beautiful mosque in Istanbul, do you?

11:51.794 --> 11:52.830
Come on!

12:38.341 --> 12:40.833
Take off your shoes and cover your hair.

13:13.835 --> 13:17.545
It's like being inside God's thoughts.

13:24.262 --> 13:28.051
It appears our time inside
God's thoughts has come to an end.

13:31.477 --> 13:32.558
Goodbye.

13:32.687 --> 13:35.020
Thank you, Mr...?

13:35.148 --> 13:38.107
Lieutenant Ismail Veli
of the Ottoman Imperial Army.

13:39.444 --> 13:42.983
When I'm not playing tour guide
to young American ladies.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.022
Lillian Rowe.

13:45.158 --> 13:49.619
Well... I hope your visit to my country
is a pleasant one, Miss Rowe.

13:49.746 --> 13:52.989
Pleasant but brief. There's a war coming.

14:03.968 --> 14:07.803
I'm sorry, Miss Rowe,
but I can no longer guarantee delivery.

14:07.930 --> 14:12.095
The Ottoman Empire may be entering
a state of war any day now.

14:12.226 --> 14:16.516
Goods intended for the American missions
are being detained.

14:17.607 --> 14:19.974
Your only choice is to return home.

14:20.610 --> 14:23.148
I didn't come this far
just to turn around now.

14:24.030 --> 14:28.240
There may be one way
in which you can obtain permission.

14:28.368 --> 14:29.404
Yes?

14:30.286 --> 14:32.494
You would need to find a military escort.

14:36.417 --> 14:38.909
Uncle, this is ridiculous.

14:39.045 --> 14:43.881
The American girl requested you by name.
Think of it as an opportunity.

14:44.008 --> 14:48.343
An opportunity? This hospital
is in the middle of nowhere.

14:48.471 --> 14:53.683
Once this war begins, Russia will try
to expand its borders into Anatolia.

14:53.810 --> 14:58.521
The question is whether the Armenians
in the region will stand with the empire

14:58.648 --> 15:00.355
or join the Russians against us.

15:00.483 --> 15:03.726
Ah. So you want me to be a spy?

15:03.861 --> 15:05.978
Let us be honest with each other.

15:06.823 --> 15:10.066
Your name and your charm
have carried you this far.

15:11.160 --> 15:14.744
But now it's time for you to prove yourself.

15:18.543 --> 15:19.579
All right.

15:36.811 --> 15:39.975
I just don't know when I'll be back.
We'll see.

15:41.149 --> 15:42.606
Lieutenant Veli.

15:44.068 --> 15:46.230
I can't thank you enough for your help.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.112
Actually, Miss Rowe, it's I
who should be thanking you.

15:49.240 --> 15:52.608
This is a great opportunity
to put aside my military career

15:52.743 --> 15:57.989
and help you drag your boxes and your
ridiculous truck to the edge of nowhere.

16:43.628 --> 16:44.914
Lieutenant Veli.

16:48.090 --> 16:52.300
I am sorry if this trip interferes
with your grand plans for yourself,

16:52.428 --> 16:56.092
but given that your countrymen
are in desperate need of medical help,

16:56.224 --> 16:59.262
you might think about their needs
instead of your own.

17:02.939 --> 17:04.555
Erm...

17:06.108 --> 17:07.895
You can't be here.

17:29.966 --> 17:31.002
Miss Rowe!

17:31.133 --> 17:34.467
Miss Rowe! There are customs here.

17:34.595 --> 17:37.178
You need to observe them
if you're going to get along.

17:37.306 --> 17:39.423
Thank you, Lieutenant, for pointing that...

18:47.585 --> 18:52.296
- You shouldn't wander off.
- I'm perfectly fine.

18:54.634 --> 18:58.423
Is that Mount Ararat where Noah landed?

18:58.554 --> 19:03.094
Yes. We call it Agri Dagi.

19:03.225 --> 19:05.182
Agri Dagi.

19:06.187 --> 19:09.305
Noah and the Great Flood. Adam and Eve.

19:09.440 --> 19:12.524
You know, it's also
part of the Islamic culture.

19:12.652 --> 19:13.688
- Really?
- Hm-hm.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.606
- Adam and Eve?
- Hm-hm.

19:15.738 --> 19:19.482
Only in the Islamic telling,
they weren't driven out of the garden.

19:19.617 --> 19:22.234
They were placed
in different parts of the world,

19:22.370 --> 19:24.487
so they had to search to find each other.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.417
Please stay close.

19:56.237 --> 19:57.773
Wake up. Wake up.

19:57.905 --> 20:01.239
Whatever happens, don't show yourself.

20:01.867 --> 20:03.699
Hide!

20:23.556 --> 20:26.720
We're bringing medical supplies
to the American Mission Hospital.

20:26.851 --> 20:29.844
It's just medicine and bandages
and supplies for people in need.

20:29.979 --> 20:32.722
Your boots. Your boots are army.

20:33.899 --> 20:35.106
They're just boots.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.061
Drop the rifle, Turk.

20:43.826 --> 20:49.538
I know who you are, soldier.
The question is, am I going to kill you?

20:50.332 --> 20:53.325
Or will my Christian conscience prevent me?

20:53.461 --> 20:57.045
Hey! Shall we kill this Turkish dog?

20:59.216 --> 21:00.957
Get in!

21:01.093 --> 21:02.425
Go, go, go!

21:07.641 --> 21:09.177
Let's go! Let's go!

21:12.104 --> 21:13.561
Yah! Yah!

21:26.160 --> 21:27.196
Get him!

22:00.694 --> 22:02.435
I can't control it!

22:04.114 --> 22:05.855
Come on!

22:30.683 --> 22:33.096
Miss Rowe, we are lucky.

22:33.227 --> 22:35.184
- Lucky?
- Yes.

22:35.312 --> 22:39.056
I lost the medical supplies.
I lost the truck. My brother's truck.

22:39.191 --> 22:41.399
They would have taken those things anyway.

22:41.527 --> 22:45.020
- One more thing they would have taken.
- And what's that?

22:45.155 --> 22:46.612
Our lives.

23:10.514 --> 23:13.848
- You can use this as a pillow.
- Thank you.

23:13.976 --> 23:15.308
There.

23:16.687 --> 23:21.273
- Thank you, Lieutenant.
- Apologies for the arrangement.

23:31.076 --> 23:33.489
I hope you'll be able to get some sleep.

23:50.888 --> 23:52.754
Hello!

23:55.559 --> 23:57.846
Hello!

23:57.978 --> 24:00.721
How do you say "hello" in Turkish?

24:00.856 --> 24:03.974
<i>Merhaba.</i>

24:04.109 --> 24:05.691
<i>Merhaba.</i>

24:28.759 --> 24:30.295
Is that the mission?

24:31.095 --> 24:34.930
No. That's the garrison
where I've been posted.

24:35.057 --> 24:37.094
Your mission hospital is over there.

24:47.361 --> 24:48.397
Come.

25:00.165 --> 25:03.283
Well, you made it.

25:08.090 --> 25:09.126
Goodbye, Miss Rowe.

25:10.259 --> 25:12.751
I hope we'll be able to see each other...

25:12.886 --> 25:14.502
Miss Rowe?

25:17.141 --> 25:18.427
What are you doing here?

25:19.852 --> 25:23.562
- Really?
- Dr Gresham, it's a long story.

25:24.857 --> 25:27.816
- Are you all right?
- I'm... I'm fine, actually.

25:27.943 --> 25:30.356
And this is my escort, Lieutenant Veli.

25:30.863 --> 25:33.446
- Lieutenant, this is Dr Gresham.
- Doctor.

25:33.574 --> 25:39.241
Lieutenant.
Thank you for bringing her safely to us.

25:40.914 --> 25:42.951
My pleasure.

25:43.917 --> 25:45.874
Let's get you out of the sun, shall we?

25:48.964 --> 25:50.956
Thank you, Lieutenant.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.724
So what happened to you?

26:05.856 --> 26:08.473
I was... I was bringing your medical supplies

26:08.609 --> 26:11.226
- in my brother's truck, as I promised.
- You brought the truck?

26:11.361 --> 26:15.822
Unfortunately it was stolen
in the mountains by bandits

26:15.949 --> 26:19.033
along with all the supplies. I'm so sorry.

26:19.161 --> 26:24.122
You're here. You're alive.
That's what counts. Come on.

26:27.711 --> 26:30.249
Since I can't deliver the supplies, I...

26:30.380 --> 26:35.216
- I'd like to volunteer my services.
- You want to be a nurse here?

26:35.344 --> 26:38.178
- Well, you need nurses, don't you?
- Badly.

26:41.100 --> 26:44.593
- That's Dr Woodruff, our founder.
- Could I meet him?

26:46.897 --> 26:48.604
Of course.

26:52.402 --> 26:53.438
Garrett.

26:54.363 --> 26:59.028
- What is it? Who's this?
- Her name is Lillian Rowe.

26:59.159 --> 27:02.277
She's come from Philadelphia
to bring us valuable medical supplies.

27:02.412 --> 27:05.996
I'm afraid there was a problem with
the supplies, but I'd like to stay...

27:06.125 --> 27:09.744
Stay? You can't stay.

27:09.878 --> 27:11.619
What is she talking about, Gresham?

27:12.422 --> 27:14.038
She's a trained nurse, Garrett.

27:14.174 --> 27:16.917
And she's volunteered her services.
We can't afford to...

27:17.678 --> 27:19.044
Miss Rowe?

27:20.973 --> 27:22.430
Go home.

27:23.684 --> 27:25.846
Go home immediately.

27:30.149 --> 27:32.687
Is everyone one around here
losing their mind but me?

27:37.823 --> 27:39.780
This is no place for a woman.

27:47.457 --> 27:52.077
I apologise.
Dr Woodruff can be a little blunt.

27:53.130 --> 27:55.713
- Would you like to see the main ward?
- Yes.

27:55.841 --> 27:58.584
As you can see, we have 24 beds active.

27:58.719 --> 27:59.926
- Doctor.
- Two in...

28:00.053 --> 28:02.295
- Doctor.
- Excuse me.

28:12.441 --> 28:13.477
Hello.

28:15.903 --> 28:17.690
What's your name?

28:19.615 --> 28:21.151
I'm Lillie.

28:22.075 --> 28:24.237
And you are?

28:24.369 --> 28:28.534
Aghavni.

28:28.665 --> 28:30.247
That's a lovely name.

28:30.375 --> 28:31.741
Aghavni.

28:35.839 --> 28:37.250
What's that?

28:40.219 --> 28:41.710
A... A bird?

28:43.013 --> 28:45.050
Aghavni means "bird"?

28:45.182 --> 28:47.048
Dove.

28:48.143 --> 28:50.601
Aghavni means "dove".

28:50.729 --> 28:52.846
Oh, oh, oh...

28:54.316 --> 28:55.557
Is that malaria?

28:57.945 --> 28:59.402
Malaria?

29:00.656 --> 29:02.773
Pay attention to the symptoms.

29:03.408 --> 29:05.400
The deep bronchial cough.

29:05.535 --> 29:09.620
Body completely covered
in bright red rash. Hm?

29:12.376 --> 29:13.742
It's typhus.

29:17.839 --> 29:19.296
Not malaria.

29:21.093 --> 29:26.259
You can't even recognise typhus.
Where did you get your training?

29:27.516 --> 29:29.473
Dr Gresham! Doctor!

29:36.775 --> 29:38.812
He does not breathe. He does not breathe.

29:38.944 --> 29:40.981
- Take care of him, Zoya.
- He does not breathe.

29:48.912 --> 29:52.371
- No respiration. No heartbeat.
- His pupils aren't contracted.

29:52.499 --> 29:54.411
He's still alive.

29:54.543 --> 29:56.580
Pleural abscess upper right quadrant.

29:56.712 --> 29:59.125
It's crushing his heart and lungs.

29:59.256 --> 30:01.122
Scalpel.

30:05.679 --> 30:07.466
Gauze.

30:10.100 --> 30:11.887
Gauze.

30:15.772 --> 30:16.933
Forceps.

30:21.611 --> 30:22.647
Gauze.

30:34.875 --> 30:36.832
I'm gonna catch you, you little doll!

30:37.878 --> 30:39.119
Caught you!

30:44.051 --> 30:46.418
Caught you!

30:48.347 --> 30:50.680
Zoya, can you keep an eye on her?

30:59.024 --> 31:00.140
How did this happen?

31:03.403 --> 31:05.645
Lillie. Lillie.

31:06.782 --> 31:08.739
Let us deal with this.

31:09.493 --> 31:13.988
Nurse Rowe, I believe you already
know our friend, Christapor.

31:14.706 --> 31:15.742
Friend?

31:15.874 --> 31:20.118
He's come here to sell us this fine
equipment, which we need very badly.

31:20.670 --> 31:23.708
You expect to be paid
for what you've already stolen?

31:24.424 --> 31:26.461
I came across these things in the mountains.

31:26.593 --> 31:28.550
That's a lie. He's a thief. He's a bandit.

31:28.678 --> 31:33.389
Young woman! Control yourself.
We're trying to conduct business here.

31:35.227 --> 31:36.718
Very fine equipment.

31:36.853 --> 31:40.437
But it doesn't matter.
We can't meet your price.

31:40.565 --> 31:43.808
- My price is very reasonable.
- Your price is too high.

31:43.944 --> 31:47.153
- I won't be extorted.
- Garrett, let me work something out.

31:48.115 --> 31:50.823
We need this equipment.

31:50.951 --> 31:53.910
Take Miss Rowe inside. Let me deal with it.

32:06.174 --> 32:07.210
Christapor.

32:08.718 --> 32:11.301
Is there anything else we could do for you?

32:13.723 --> 32:16.591
I hope that's not a letter of resignation.

32:16.726 --> 32:20.219
No, it's my parents.

32:21.022 --> 32:22.934
I thought you'd be pleased.

32:23.066 --> 32:25.103
Your brother's truck has finally arrived.

32:26.653 --> 32:29.521
I don't understand making deals with thieves.

32:31.700 --> 32:36.491
In the Armenian community, Christapor
and his men are considered heroes.

32:37.497 --> 32:41.958
They're making a stand for Christianity
against the Turkish Muslims.

32:42.544 --> 32:44.752
I thought we were supposed to be neutral.

32:50.093 --> 32:52.961
This war in Europe...

32:55.390 --> 32:57.552
is going to split Anatolia down the middle.

32:59.102 --> 33:01.594
The Armenians on one side
and the Turks on the other.

33:02.230 --> 33:05.849
It's going to be bloody.
A lot of people are going to die.

33:06.735 --> 33:10.820
We're going to need your supplies
to help everyone.

33:13.909 --> 33:16.617
Now do you understand why I had to do it?

33:19.581 --> 33:21.072
I'm beginning to.

33:27.714 --> 33:29.330
Good night.

33:29.549 --> 33:39.548
<i># We are climbing Jacob's ladder</i>

33:40.101 --> 33:43.185
<i># Soldiers of the cross</i>

33:44.356 --> 33:54.153
<i># Every rung goes higher, higher</i>

33:54.783 --> 33:57.617
<i># Soldiers of the cross</i>

33:58.745 --> 34:05.538
<i># We are climbing higher, higher</i>

34:06.044 --> 34:09.286
<i># We are climbing higher, higher</i>

34:09.422 --> 34:12.505
<i># Soldiers of the cross</i>

34:13.552 --> 34:23.551
<i># Sinners, do you love my Jesus?</i>

34:25.397 --> 34:28.014
<i># Soldiers of the cross</i>

34:29.234 --> 34:31.100
Hey!

34:36.074 --> 34:40.318
My parents died when I was young.
I was attached to no one.

34:40.453 --> 34:42.536
But you have a family.

34:42.664 --> 34:45.657
My brother Frank was the only one
who really understood me.

34:45.792 --> 34:51.083
- You told me he passed away.
- Tuberculosis.

34:51.214 --> 34:52.625
I'm sorry, Lillie.

34:58.388 --> 35:00.550
He was training to be a doctor.

35:02.392 --> 35:05.351
So when he died,
I knew exactly what I wanted to do.

35:07.522 --> 35:08.854
Frank would have loved this.

35:10.609 --> 35:12.441
And you?

35:25.123 --> 35:29.163
- Come on!
- What is it? I don't understand.

35:29.294 --> 35:31.911
It's begun. They're killing each other now.

35:44.726 --> 35:47.514
<i>Full-scale war was raging in Europe.</i>

35:49.439 --> 35:52.898
<i>It became known as the First World War.</i>

35:53.026 --> 35:55.518
<i>"The war to end all wars."</i>

35:57.322 --> 36:00.941
<i>We read news about</i>
<i>the horrors and atrocities.</i>

36:02.327 --> 36:05.911
<i>Trench warfare. No man's land.</i>

36:06.539 --> 36:07.996
<i>Poison gas.</i>

36:09.084 --> 36:11.701
<i>Dogfights in the air.</i>

36:12.629 --> 36:16.418
<i>And often the battles took place</i>
<i>weeks or even months</i>

36:16.549 --> 36:18.506
<i>before the news reached us.</i>

36:20.929 --> 36:24.388
<i>Though it all seemed so very far away,</i>

36:24.516 --> 36:28.476
<i>we knew we wouldn't escape</i>
<i>its bloody reach for long.</i>

37:15.400 --> 37:16.641
At ease, Lieutenant.

37:17.694 --> 37:20.107
I believe you are acquainted with Miss Rowe.

37:21.114 --> 37:24.357
- Lieutenant Veli.
- Miss Rowe.

37:24.492 --> 37:28.702
Miss Rowe will be returning a patient
to a village nearby in two days' time.

37:28.830 --> 37:31.368
And I'm assigning you as her official escort.

37:33.710 --> 37:35.872
It'd be a great honour to accompany you.

37:36.004 --> 37:38.212
I'm pleased to hear it.

37:39.132 --> 37:42.546
That'll be all, Lieutenant.
I'll make the proper arrangements.

40:20.877 --> 40:22.413
Aghavni!

40:22.545 --> 40:25.288
Yaya!

40:29.886 --> 40:30.922
What happened here?

40:32.889 --> 40:36.098
Men came. Many men. With guns and swords.

40:36.225 --> 40:40.970
- Were they dressed like him?
- No. They were not soldiers.

40:46.736 --> 40:49.900
- Have you any wounded?
- Yes.

41:03.127 --> 41:07.542
Your friend, Lieutenant Veli,
isn't here to protect you.

41:07.674 --> 41:10.508
He's here to gather information
on the outlying villages.

41:14.263 --> 41:16.004
We can't leave Aghavni here.

41:17.433 --> 41:19.265
We don't have a choice, Lillie.

41:21.479 --> 41:23.391
The children are all they have now.

42:36.137 --> 42:37.753
Is everything all right?

42:37.889 --> 42:40.006
It's all right, but we need to leave soon.

42:40.141 --> 42:43.475
Of course. You need to report back
to your superiors.

42:44.520 --> 42:47.433
You have your mission, Doctor,
and I have mine.

42:47.565 --> 42:49.477
My mission is saving lives.

42:50.234 --> 42:51.691
And what? Mine is taking them?

42:51.819 --> 42:54.687
Just because I wear a uniform
and carry a gun, that makes me a killer?

42:58.326 --> 42:59.783
Yes.

43:01.704 --> 43:03.536
This wasn't done by my army.

43:06.209 --> 43:08.917
These people are under your protection.

43:09.712 --> 43:13.877
If you allow things like this to happen,
then you are supporting their cause.

43:14.008 --> 43:15.044
What cause?

43:15.176 --> 43:17.839
Driving all of the Christians
out of Anatolia!

43:20.473 --> 43:22.806
- I would never support that.
- You already are.

43:23.476 --> 43:26.344
You're a soldier and soldiers take orders,

43:26.479 --> 43:28.846
no matter how many
innocent people are killed.

43:28.981 --> 43:30.563
You don't know who I am.

43:34.278 --> 43:37.567
I know it's men like you that spill the blood

43:37.698 --> 43:39.860
that men like me are expected to clean up.

43:39.992 --> 43:41.779
Please, both of you, stop!

43:48.918 --> 43:50.534
We're leaving.

44:55.818 --> 44:57.684
Now that you've seen it up close,

44:59.155 --> 45:01.397
the way these people live and die,

45:02.450 --> 45:05.318
no one would blame you
if you wanted to leave.

45:06.078 --> 45:09.321
- You think I want to leave?
- No.

45:10.124 --> 45:13.663
But now you understand
why the Armenians have to fight.

45:15.922 --> 45:20.883
Is that why you're hiding guns for them?
In the chapel?

45:23.888 --> 45:26.221
You think it's hypocrisy.

45:26.349 --> 45:29.057
I can see you believe
it's the right thing to do.

45:29.185 --> 45:30.642
Don't you?

45:31.687 --> 45:33.770
I'm not sure.

45:39.403 --> 45:40.519
Lillie.

45:42.323 --> 45:44.235
In the short time you've been here,

45:44.408 --> 45:47.321
I have begun to wonder.

45:47.453 --> 45:49.194
Maybe this is a kind of...

45:50.957 --> 45:52.869
Ah!

45:53.584 --> 45:55.325
I'm interrupting.

45:59.006 --> 46:03.341
- Have you had your supper?
- No, I don't suppose I have.

46:03.469 --> 46:05.882
Well, here, sit down. I'll get it for you.

46:12.270 --> 46:15.513
You should eat something, Garrett.
I'll take the evening rounds.

46:37.545 --> 46:38.831
He's in love with you.

46:42.133 --> 46:43.465
Would that be wrong?

46:45.469 --> 46:48.052
I'd hate to see him disappointed.

46:49.140 --> 46:51.223
I told you the first time I saw you.

46:52.101 --> 46:53.888
This is no place for a woman.

46:55.396 --> 46:58.264
I'm not afraid, Dr Woodruff.

46:58.858 --> 46:59.894
No.

47:02.111 --> 47:03.477
You're not afraid.

47:08.993 --> 47:10.484
Neither was she.

47:17.710 --> 47:20.623
I don't know your approach...

47:20.755 --> 47:25.796
..to medicine, Miss Rowe.

47:28.596 --> 47:34.092
Possibly you overflow with the nobility
of relieving human suffering.

47:38.439 --> 47:40.806
You know my approach?

47:42.193 --> 47:43.604
It's a game.

47:46.489 --> 47:49.232
A bloody game.

47:49.367 --> 47:52.451
In which we pit our puny brains and skills

47:52.578 --> 47:57.039
against the forces of destruction
and disease and lose.

47:58.834 --> 48:00.871
We are drowning in death.

48:07.385 --> 48:09.547
I don't expect you to understand.

48:11.597 --> 48:13.213
But you will.

48:42.420 --> 48:44.377
The shard of glass is close.

48:57.393 --> 48:59.430
He'll lose the eye if we're not precise.

49:14.952 --> 49:15.988
Dr Gresham.

49:16.120 --> 49:19.329
Garrett, let me finish this.

49:19.457 --> 49:23.121
Perhaps, yes.
It's, erm... good training for you.

49:30.468 --> 49:31.925
Hold his head.

49:35.848 --> 49:37.840
Dr Woodruff?

49:56.160 --> 49:57.492
Don't touch that.

50:12.468 --> 50:13.504
Typhus.

50:16.722 --> 50:18.679
I couldn't save them.

50:20.017 --> 50:23.181
- I understand.
- You...

50:23.729 --> 50:27.018
You... You don't understand.

50:31.403 --> 50:34.692
You want to believe in a God
that's good and just.

50:34.823 --> 50:39.113
He's not just. He's cruel.

50:39.245 --> 50:41.828
He's cruel beyond imagining.

50:45.459 --> 50:46.995
Let's get you to sleep.

50:55.844 --> 50:57.130
All right.

50:59.431 --> 51:01.343
What was your wife's name?

51:04.520 --> 51:05.681
Marie.

51:09.149 --> 51:12.062
And you started this hospital with her?

51:13.362 --> 51:14.694
I did, yes.

51:17.658 --> 51:20.275
Would she want you
to punish yourself like this?

54:01.321 --> 54:03.233
- Good.
- Good.

54:04.283 --> 54:06.366
How did you find me?

54:06.493 --> 54:10.988
- Erm... I saw you from the fortress.
- You were watching me?

54:11.123 --> 54:13.740
I was admiring the beauty of the landscape.

54:15.335 --> 54:20.126
- Is that an island?
- Yes. It's called Ahtamar.

54:20.257 --> 54:22.169
From here, it looks like a mirage.

54:23.302 --> 54:25.760
There's an old church there. It's beautiful.

54:26.221 --> 54:29.965
As a Christian, you'd be welcome.
With an official escort, of course.

54:30.100 --> 54:33.309
Of course. Let's go.

54:37.858 --> 54:40.896
For a few coins,
he might let us borrow his boat.

55:03.008 --> 55:07.173
Being on the water always makes
the rest of the world go away.

55:08.972 --> 55:12.966
It's like being inside God's thoughts.

55:21.068 --> 55:22.650
It's beautiful here.

55:23.737 --> 55:26.696
Thank you. It's my land.

55:30.828 --> 55:32.785
Are you glad you came?

55:32.913 --> 55:36.782
- To the island?
- No. To this.

55:37.835 --> 55:41.829
- You're very brave.
- I was running away.

55:43.465 --> 55:44.751
Why?

55:46.385 --> 55:49.844
I couldn't be what other people
wanted me to be.

55:57.354 --> 56:00.472
What about you?
Have you always wanted to be a soldier?

56:02.234 --> 56:05.147
Well, I had no choice.

56:07.865 --> 56:09.697
It's the family business.

56:09.825 --> 56:10.861
You go too.

56:12.244 --> 56:13.280
Nice.

56:15.873 --> 56:17.785
Wouldn't you like to break free?

56:20.836 --> 56:26.207
Freedom is an illusion.
We... we all take the role we're given.

56:26.341 --> 56:27.798
I don't believe that.

56:29.011 --> 56:31.094
Do you?

56:33.974 --> 56:36.637
Less and less, every time I see you.

56:45.027 --> 56:47.440
So much for a homeward breeze.

56:49.031 --> 56:51.114
I don't mind floating for a while.

57:04.755 --> 57:07.623
I've wanted to touch you
almost from the moment we met.

57:09.927 --> 57:13.216
But I'm a Muslim and you're a Christian.

57:15.474 --> 57:17.010
We share so little.

57:20.103 --> 57:22.937
Were Adam and Eve Muslim?

57:23.815 --> 57:27.559
- Or were they Christian?
- They were neither.

57:27.694 --> 57:29.731
But they shared the same God.

57:46.505 --> 57:50.419
How do you say "kiss" in Turkish?

57:53.971 --> 57:55.052
<i>Buse.</i>

57:57.224 --> 57:59.967
<i>Buse,</i> then.

58:42.185 --> 58:44.893
Ha! It looks like we have wind.

59:26.938 --> 59:30.727
- We were worried about you.
- I can assure you I was fine.

59:32.778 --> 59:35.145
I'd like a word with Lieutenant Veli,
if I may.

59:38.033 --> 59:39.569
Good afternoon, Miss Rowe.

59:40.619 --> 59:42.281
Lieutenant.

59:46.750 --> 59:47.786
Ah! Thank you.

59:47.918 --> 59:51.252
You understand that the young lady
is under our care and protection.

59:53.090 --> 59:56.549
Except when she leaves the city,
and then she's under mine.

59:56.676 --> 01:00:01.546
Let's be clear. Your religion frowns
on socialising with Christian women.

01:00:01.681 --> 01:00:06.847
Miss Rowe and I are friends. Or is that
something your religion frowns on?

01:00:06.978 --> 01:00:10.471
- I don't want her misled.
- Misled?

01:00:10.982 --> 01:00:13.474
You know what I'm talking about.

01:00:14.528 --> 01:00:18.522
Don't worry, Dr Gresham.
Her honour is intact.

01:00:18.657 --> 01:00:20.819
What does that mean?

01:01:17.924 --> 01:01:19.916
This is unacceptable.

01:01:20.051 --> 01:01:22.543
I won't have it.

01:01:52.417 --> 01:01:54.704
I want this dressing changed twice daily.

01:01:56.546 --> 01:01:58.754
And watch him closely for signs of fever.

01:02:01.051 --> 01:02:02.212
Jude.

01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:04.836
Jude.

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:08.180
You're angry.

01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:12.552
Of course I'm angry.

01:02:15.941 --> 01:02:18.024
But I can't tell you what to do.

01:02:19.402 --> 01:02:21.439
That's up to you and your conscience.

01:02:30.330 --> 01:02:33.869
You and I know each other.

01:02:35.794 --> 01:02:37.160
We share the same dreams.

01:02:39.005 --> 01:02:41.167
The same beliefs.

01:02:42.175 --> 01:02:44.337
We could make a life together.

01:02:57.691 --> 01:02:59.648
I'm sorry, Jude.

01:03:12.372 --> 01:03:13.613
<i>It was no surprise</i>

01:03:13.748 --> 01:03:17.788
<i>when the Ottoman Empire joined the fight</i>
<i>on the side of Germany.</i>

01:03:21.923 --> 01:03:25.382
<i>Or when Russia declared war on the empire</i>

01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:28.093
<i>and began a massive invasion from the east.</i>

01:03:30.682 --> 01:03:34.596
<i>Our village, Van, was directly</i>
<i>in the path of the Russian army.</i>

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:38.812
<i>For some of the local Armenians,</i>

01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:41.648
<i>the Russians were their gateway</i>
<i>to liberation.</i>

01:03:45.488 --> 01:03:49.573
<i>The Ottomans took measures</i>
<i>to stamp out the Armenian rebels.</i>

01:03:49.701 --> 01:03:52.284
<i>And the rebels fought back.</i>

01:03:53.121 --> 01:03:56.410
Armenian rebels have taken over
the centre of the city

01:03:56.541 --> 01:03:57.907
and they plan to hold it

01:03:58.043 --> 01:04:00.877
until Russian troops
can cross the border and join them.

01:04:01.004 --> 01:04:06.625
So, your orders are to penetrate their
defences and assess their strength.

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:09.218
And, Colonel Khalil,
how will we know the difference

01:04:09.346 --> 01:04:12.009
between the rebels and the ordinary citizens?

01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:14.723
The rebels will be the ones
trying to kill you.

01:04:51.388 --> 01:04:53.380
Come on. Go, go!

01:04:53.515 --> 01:04:54.926
Go, go.

01:05:09.697 --> 01:05:11.279
Come on!

01:09:19.781 --> 01:09:21.818
And who is this?

01:09:21.948 --> 01:09:23.564
This is a patient.

01:09:24.952 --> 01:09:27.990
More specific. Turkish? Armenian?

01:09:28.956 --> 01:09:32.495
A patient recovering
from blunt trauma to his left leg.

01:09:32.627 --> 01:09:34.162
Dr Woodruff.

01:09:34.295 --> 01:09:38.585
I insist the use of these beds
be turned over to the Ottoman army.

01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:45.050
The flag over this mission
is American, not Ottoman.

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:49.300
By international protocol, we have
the right to administer as we see fit.

01:09:50.310 --> 01:09:53.224
I built this hospital to help
those who most need our help.

01:09:53.356 --> 01:09:57.851
So, when any of your boys are carried here

01:09:57.985 --> 01:10:03.777
with a leg missing
or their entrails cupped in their hands,

01:10:03.908 --> 01:10:05.570
we will take care of them.

01:10:07.954 --> 01:10:11.288
Search the entire hospital,
top to bottom. See what they're hiding.

01:10:11.416 --> 01:10:15.126
- You have no authority to do this.
- It is wartime, Doctor.

01:10:15.253 --> 01:10:17.119
I have every authority.

01:10:22.135 --> 01:10:23.592
Let's go in here.

01:10:30.226 --> 01:10:33.390
This is an outrage.
You cannot just walk in here.

01:10:33.521 --> 01:10:36.264
Lieutenant, this is a sanctified chapel.

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:39.687
Please.

01:10:40.319 --> 01:10:42.902
There's nothing to interest you in here.

01:10:49.954 --> 01:10:51.411
Please.

01:10:54.584 --> 01:10:55.745
Stop.

01:10:57.462 --> 01:10:59.249
Go and search the stables.

01:11:13.728 --> 01:11:15.185
Thank you.

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:20.857
Lillie.

01:11:22.445 --> 01:11:23.777
I have to see you.

01:11:36.209 --> 01:11:38.667
My government will hear about this.

01:11:38.795 --> 01:11:42.505
The Russians are burning a path
from the east and they'll be here soon.

01:11:42.632 --> 01:11:46.672
Let's see how you fare with them,
Dr Woodruff. They're savages.

01:11:46.803 --> 01:11:49.546
You Americans and Europeans,

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:55.597
whether you come here to help
or to fight or to make a profit,

01:11:55.728 --> 01:11:57.720
you'll never be anything but insignificant.

01:11:58.689 --> 01:12:01.022
We don't pretend to be anything else.

01:12:01.776 --> 01:12:04.564
When your countries
were still swamp and forests,

01:12:04.695 --> 01:12:08.405
culture had already lit up our lands
for thousands of years.

01:12:08.533 --> 01:12:10.991
And when you're nothing but history,

01:12:11.118 --> 01:12:15.909
collapsed into darkness
like Rome, like Greece,

01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:18.748
we'll still be here.

01:12:55.997 --> 01:12:58.580
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:13:01.043 --> 01:13:04.832
Lillie, I don't how much time we have.
I have to go on a mission soon.

01:14:17.453 --> 01:14:19.490
Are you sure?

01:15:12.591 --> 01:15:14.548
You've been waiting for me?

01:15:17.805 --> 01:15:19.171
Yeah.

01:15:19.932 --> 01:15:21.389
Lillie.

01:15:23.102 --> 01:15:24.263
Lillie.

01:15:32.028 --> 01:15:34.145
You were with him.

01:15:47.835 --> 01:15:49.201
Oh, Lillie?

01:15:52.048 --> 01:15:53.255
Yes?

01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:05.426
I'm so sorry.

01:17:07.206 --> 01:17:09.664
<i>The Russian invasion was upon us.</i>

01:17:10.709 --> 01:17:15.420
<i>Some Armenian rebels joined the Russian</i>
<i>forces to fight the Ottoman army</i>

01:17:15.548 --> 01:17:17.210
<i>and all hell was breaking loose.</i>

01:17:18.259 --> 01:17:21.593
<i>Near us, Armenian men</i>
<i>were taken from their homes</i>

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:24.508
<i>and conscripted to serve in the Ottoman army,</i>

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:29.886
<i>while the rounding-up of Armenian women,</i>
<i>children and the elderly had begun.</i>

01:17:31.272 --> 01:17:35.107
<i>Ismail was sent on</i>
<i>what seemed like a suicide mission</i>

01:17:35.234 --> 01:17:39.353
<i>to destroy weapons in an armoury</i>
<i>that the Russians had captured</i>

01:17:39.488 --> 01:17:41.730
<i>and were heavily guarding.</i>

01:17:43.242 --> 01:17:44.904
I am your guide.

01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:48.783
You? Where are all the others?

01:17:48.914 --> 01:17:53.249
The others were cowards.
They fled when the Russians came.

01:17:53.377 --> 01:17:56.415
- What's your name?
- My name is Ahmet, Lieutenant.

01:17:57.798 --> 01:17:59.039
All right, Ahmet.

01:18:00.134 --> 01:18:02.171
When did the Russians take the armoury?

01:18:02.303 --> 01:18:03.919
Three days ago, Lieutenant.

01:18:04.054 --> 01:18:06.262
I need to know where the munitions are kept.

01:18:52.228 --> 01:18:55.016
That's the door where they keep the guns.

01:18:57.191 --> 01:19:00.980
- Go back.
- I want to help you.

01:19:02.196 --> 01:19:05.655
You're too young. Wait with the horses.

01:20:46.759 --> 01:20:48.466
- Go!
- Where?

01:20:48.594 --> 01:20:49.926
I have nowhere to go.

01:20:50.054 --> 01:20:51.795
You go to the mission hospital

01:20:51.930 --> 01:20:54.638
and tell the American nurse
Lieutenant Veli sent you.

01:20:54.767 --> 01:20:56.633
Go!

01:22:42.749 --> 01:22:45.287
You can take her in here
to the back, please. Thank you.

01:22:45.419 --> 01:22:49.083
Lillie, the Turks have abandoned
the garrison and they left the city.

01:22:49.214 --> 01:22:50.546
Russian soldiers are coming.

01:23:15.032 --> 01:23:16.773
But you didn't see him?

01:23:16.909 --> 01:23:18.320
You didn't see him die?

01:23:20.787 --> 01:23:22.153
I have to find him.

01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:25.282
- You can't go. You'll be killed.
- I have to find him.

01:23:25.417 --> 01:23:29.161
Lillie, you're going out there
to find a dead man.

01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:31.963
He's not dead.

01:23:46.688 --> 01:23:48.520
Take this.

01:23:51.026 --> 01:23:52.983
Thank you, Dr Woodruff.

01:23:53.445 --> 01:23:55.061
I hope you won't need it.

01:23:59.284 --> 01:24:00.741
God bless you.

01:24:42.578 --> 01:24:44.695
<i>I see it more every day.</i>

01:24:46.873 --> 01:24:48.990
<i>Villages torn apart.</i>

01:24:50.127 --> 01:24:52.585
<i>How this war is destroying lives.</i>

01:24:52.713 --> 01:24:55.330
<i>Brothers fighting each other.</i>

01:24:55.465 --> 01:24:57.673
<i>Villagers fleeing their homes,</i>

01:24:58.343 --> 01:25:00.005
<i>not knowing where to go.</i>

01:25:02.139 --> 01:25:05.052
<i>Everyone just running away from the war.</i>

01:25:07.185 --> 01:25:10.223
<i>Bound only by a common pain.</i>

01:26:01.615 --> 01:26:02.856
Lillie.

01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:05.992
Lillie.

01:26:10.332 --> 01:26:11.664
Lillie.

01:26:19.841 --> 01:26:21.082
Ismail!

01:26:23.929 --> 01:26:25.420
I...

01:26:25.555 --> 01:26:28.889
Here. Have some water.

01:26:38.902 --> 01:26:40.894
Mm... Thank you.

01:26:44.199 --> 01:26:47.033
- I'm gonna take care of you.
- I'm all right. I'm all right.

01:27:53.226 --> 01:27:54.307
Wait.

01:27:54.728 --> 01:27:56.014
- Stop!
- What is it?

01:27:56.146 --> 01:27:57.387
Stop the car!

01:28:03.069 --> 01:28:06.153
- Oh, God.
- Get us down there.

01:28:27.010 --> 01:28:28.546
Who's in charge here?

01:28:30.138 --> 01:28:32.221
Huh?

01:28:33.350 --> 01:28:34.557
I am.

01:28:39.147 --> 01:28:41.935
I'm your superior. Salute me!

01:28:45.487 --> 01:28:47.729
- What are you doing?
- They're just Armenians.

01:28:49.866 --> 01:28:53.485
I'm Lieutenant Ismail Veli,
and these people are coming with me.

01:28:57.207 --> 01:28:58.368
For what reason?

01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:02.039
By order of Colonel Khalil,
for interrogation purposes.

01:29:03.004 --> 01:29:05.872
- Children, too?
- Yes. All of them.

01:29:06.591 --> 01:29:08.332
- I'll take full responsibility.
- No.

01:29:09.010 --> 01:29:10.626
- What?
- No.

01:29:10.762 --> 01:29:12.469
They're ours.

01:29:12.597 --> 01:29:15.135
This is not a request.

01:29:15.267 --> 01:29:18.226
I'm ordering you to release these people.

01:29:27.863 --> 01:29:29.525
Release them!

01:29:36.204 --> 01:29:37.786
Go.

01:29:44.796 --> 01:29:47.004
Come on. Go, go!

01:29:48.925 --> 01:29:50.041
Go!

01:29:53.847 --> 01:29:54.883
Go!

01:29:55.015 --> 01:29:58.053
Lillie! Lillie!

01:29:59.394 --> 01:30:01.681
- Lillie!
- Sh! Sh! Sh!

01:30:03.106 --> 01:30:04.597
Take her. Go!

01:30:05.692 --> 01:30:07.479
- Get in the truck!
- Wait, Lieutenant!

01:30:08.820 --> 01:30:11.187
When did Colonel Khalil issue this order?

01:30:11.323 --> 01:30:13.565
Early this morning.

01:30:13.700 --> 01:30:16.317
Colonel Khalil was killed last night.

01:30:21.708 --> 01:30:23.540
Don't try to stop us.

01:30:36.306 --> 01:30:37.422
Go!

01:30:58.244 --> 01:30:59.280
It's all right.

01:31:12.968 --> 01:31:14.004
Oh...

01:31:14.177 --> 01:31:16.419
It's all right. It's all right.

01:31:31.861 --> 01:31:34.319
There are two bullets. Internal damage.

01:31:35.365 --> 01:31:37.857
You realise the position you put us in
by bringing him here?

01:31:37.993 --> 01:31:40.360
- You won't deny him help.
- I told you.

01:31:41.955 --> 01:31:43.617
This hospital turns no one away.

01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:05.141
Gauze.

01:32:05.687 --> 01:32:07.428
Russians! The Russians!

01:32:17.657 --> 01:32:19.614
- Out.
- Gauze.

01:32:24.706 --> 01:32:25.742
Gauze.

01:32:32.756 --> 01:32:33.792
This is a hospital!

01:32:35.425 --> 01:32:37.712
This is a hospital!

01:32:37.844 --> 01:32:39.756
If you have wounded, they are welcome!

01:32:43.516 --> 01:32:45.098
We will care for your wounded.

01:32:48.897 --> 01:32:51.105
But your men with their weapons must leave.

01:33:14.297 --> 01:33:16.835
- What are you doing, Ismail?
- No, no, don't come.

01:33:16.966 --> 01:33:19.709
If the Russians find me,
they'll kill all of you.

01:33:20.220 --> 01:33:22.462
My army is on the other side of the lake.

01:33:22.597 --> 01:33:25.055
If I just get there...

01:33:36.319 --> 01:33:38.060
All right. All right.

01:34:06.266 --> 01:34:07.928
Cossacks.

01:35:20.340 --> 01:35:21.831
Stop.

01:35:25.136 --> 01:35:28.049
- Stop rowing.
- No.

01:35:30.725 --> 01:35:34.014
Look, Ismail. Can't you see?

01:35:34.145 --> 01:35:36.262
We're almost there where you'll be safe.

01:35:36.856 --> 01:35:40.395
Stop. Stop rowing.

01:35:40.526 --> 01:35:42.267
But we're so close.

01:35:53.790 --> 01:35:55.452
We're so close.

01:35:58.419 --> 01:36:00.285
Please, just be with me.

01:36:11.891 --> 01:36:14.008
I'm here. I'm here.

01:36:18.273 --> 01:36:19.309
I'm here with you.

01:36:21.192 --> 01:36:24.105
I'm here with you. I'm here with you.

01:36:26.781 --> 01:36:28.898
I'm with you.

01:36:39.252 --> 01:36:41.835
Look, Ismail.

01:36:49.095 --> 01:36:51.178
Inside God's thoughts.

01:36:53.433 --> 01:36:55.049
Yes.

01:36:56.561 --> 01:36:58.223
I remember.

01:37:02.233 --> 01:37:04.600
And I'll never forget.

01:37:11.075 --> 01:37:12.532
Lillie...

01:37:14.287 --> 01:37:15.323
Don't be afraid.

01:37:17.874 --> 01:37:19.331
Don't be afraid.

01:37:35.641 --> 01:37:37.098
Ismail?

01:37:43.024 --> 01:37:44.686
Ismail...

01:42:35.441 --> 01:42:38.184
<i>When I first came here, I had a mission.</i>

01:42:41.197 --> 01:42:43.154
<i>I wanted to make a difference.</i>

01:42:45.701 --> 01:42:47.693
<i>It took so much from me.</i>

01:42:51.707 --> 01:42:54.825
<i>I don't know if I will ever</i>
<i>stop thinking about him.</i>

01:42:58.297 --> 01:43:03.167
<i>But now I understand more than ever</i>
<i>why I need to go on.</i>

01:43:07.306 --> 01:43:09.013
<i>I am one of them now.</i>

01:43:12.353 --> 01:43:17.473
<i>And, like them, I still believe</i>
<i>in a God that is good and just.</i>

01:43:20.528 --> 01:43:24.568
<i>And I know that peace will return one day.</i>

01:43:25.305 --> 01:43:31.535
