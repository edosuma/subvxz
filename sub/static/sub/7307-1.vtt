WEBVTT

00:06.147 --> 00:09.563
Bobby, those baby backs
from Papa Joe's make the flight?

00:09.650 --> 00:10.682
Yes, sir, Mr President.

00:10.777 --> 00:13.149
They were flown in
from San Antonio 10 minutes ago, sir.

00:13.237 --> 00:16.024
- Good, let's have an early lunch.
- Yes, sir, Mr President.

00:16.114 --> 00:18.950
- I love the baby backs from Papa Joe's.
- I know, Mr President.

00:19.035 --> 00:21.680
Wasn't Major Kerry supposed to be
handling the football on this one?

00:21.704 --> 00:23.282
He came down
with the flu, Mr President.

00:23.373 --> 00:25.946
This is
Commander Ray Trapp, Mr President.

00:26.042 --> 00:27.916
He's new on the detail.

00:28.002 --> 00:29.627
- Have we met, Commander?
- Yes, sir.

00:29.712 --> 00:32.797
- On the Abraham Lincoln, Mr President.
- The Lincoln.

00:32.882 --> 00:36.962
Yeah, the trip to the Lincoln
was the best day I've had on this job.

00:37.637 --> 00:40.388
- Why don't you join me for lunch?
- Be my pleasure, Mr President.

00:40.473 --> 00:42.631
Good, I look forward to it.

00:45.103 --> 00:47.095
Lunch with the boss on your first day.

00:47.188 --> 00:50.639
You're destined for stars
on those shoulders, Commander.

01:14.006 --> 01:15.169
Excuse me.

01:17.718 --> 01:21.218
Agent Baer, Agent Todd,
would either of you like anything to eat?

01:21.305 --> 01:23.678
- No, thank you.
- I'm fine, thanks.

01:23.766 --> 01:24.797
Very well.

01:24.892 --> 01:27.514
I'll be in Comm getting
an update from Backhoe.

01:27.603 --> 01:29.643
Keep an eye on things down here.

01:29.856 --> 01:31.979
You expecting a problem, sir?

01:32.817 --> 01:34.893
Expect problems, Agent Todd.

01:34.986 --> 01:38.402
And with a little luck,
you'll never lose a president.

01:52.086 --> 01:54.838
I fumbled in my first army-navy game

01:56.340 --> 01:58.250
but I recovered the ball.

02:02.305 --> 02:03.633
Ray Trapp.

02:03.764 --> 02:05.093
Kate Todd.

02:05.683 --> 02:08.008
Eating with the President was

02:08.519 --> 02:10.346
a bigger sweat than

02:11.230 --> 02:13.270
making a night trap.

02:13.983 --> 02:15.774
Are you ill, Commander?

02:17.987 --> 02:20.988
Slammer. Rosefern.
Medical emergency. Section One.

02:23.284 --> 02:25.360
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

02:26.829 --> 02:28.454
What have you got?

02:29.582 --> 02:31.373
- He's not breathing!
- No pulse.

02:31.459 --> 02:32.573
Give me the bag.

02:32.668 --> 02:34.542
Doctor, he just had lunch
with the President.

02:34.629 --> 02:36.455
- Oh, my God!
- Let's go!

02:36.756 --> 02:39.045
All right, you stay with the football.

02:42.428 --> 02:44.006
Pulse compressions.

02:45.598 --> 02:47.306
Let's take a pulse.

02:48.392 --> 02:50.883
There's no pulse. Let's get his shirt off.

03:52.154 --> 03:53.185
Yeah, Gibbs.

03:53.280 --> 03:55.440
A navy commander carrying the football
on Air Force One

03:55.532 --> 03:56.813
just carked in the air.

03:56.909 --> 03:57.940
Where'd they land?

03:58.035 --> 03:59.494
Wichita, Kansas.

03:59.578 --> 04:01.405
President's transferring
to the backup bird.

04:01.497 --> 04:04.700
I booked us on a 1500
United flight out of Reagan.

04:04.792 --> 04:05.954
Stops in Dallas

04:06.043 --> 04:07.502
before going on to Wichita.

04:07.586 --> 04:09.329
That the best you could do?

04:09.421 --> 04:11.912
It's Saturday, Gibbs.
You know, if we had our own jet...

04:12.007 --> 04:13.038
We don't.

04:13.133 --> 04:14.694
Ducky's buds with coroners
across the country.

04:14.718 --> 04:17.197
See if he can't get one of them
to hold the body until we get there.

04:17.221 --> 04:18.300
All right.

04:18.387 --> 04:20.962
Good afternoon. I'm Doris McMillon
with a CBS news update.

04:21.058 --> 04:23.015
We have just learned that Air Force One

04:23.101 --> 04:24.809
has made an unscheduled stop

04:24.895 --> 04:26.971
at Wichita's Mid-Continent Airport.

04:27.064 --> 04:28.309
Details are sketchy...

04:28.398 --> 04:31.269
Attention, passengers,
this is a gate change announcement.

04:31.360 --> 04:34.396
FBI, CIA, DEA, ATF.

04:34.488 --> 04:36.315
Even NYPD have private jets.

04:36.406 --> 04:39.657
- 36 cents a mile, you wanna drive?
- It's humiliating.

04:40.702 --> 04:43.988
- Hey, we're LEOs.
- And I'm Capricorn.

04:44.623 --> 04:47.244
LEO, short for law enforcement officer.

04:48.085 --> 04:51.121
Mr Bernard Kelly,
please return to the security check.

04:51.296 --> 04:54.250
You new at this, Dennis?

04:54.591 --> 04:55.920
First week.

04:56.385 --> 04:58.923
NCIS. Never heard of it.

05:00.138 --> 05:04.302
- That's embarrassing.
- NCIS anything like CSI?

05:04.393 --> 05:06.432
Only if you're dyslexic.

05:06.895 --> 05:09.517
Okay, you can go ahead
and go around the metal detector

05:09.606 --> 05:11.287
but your bags gotta go
through the scanner.

05:11.316 --> 05:13.143
Wait a minute.
Letting us take weapons aboard

05:13.235 --> 05:14.356
and you wanna scan our bags?

05:14.444 --> 05:17.813
Well, you got permits
for the weapons, you don't for the bags.

05:17.906 --> 05:22.034
- We really need our own jet.
- Dennis! Those bags are mine.

05:23.287 --> 05:25.348
Why didn't you tell me
you were schlepping for the doc?

05:25.372 --> 05:27.032
He's got a bag permit.

05:27.791 --> 05:29.250
Move it, men.

05:30.544 --> 05:32.786
We don't wanna miss our flight.

05:39.887 --> 05:43.801
If J. Edgar Hoover was alive,
I'd tell him what I'm telling you.

05:43.891 --> 05:46.097
This body is in Wichita County,

05:46.184 --> 05:48.806
and as a county coroner,
I have jurisdiction.

05:48.896 --> 05:52.015
No one moves it
until the ME says they can.

05:52.274 --> 05:55.228
Your jurisdiction
doesn't supersede the FBI

05:55.319 --> 05:59.530
- on Air Force One.
- It's not Air Force One, Agent Fornell.

06:00.073 --> 06:02.280
When the President departed
on the backup plane,

06:02.367 --> 06:03.945
it became Air Force One.

06:04.036 --> 06:06.705
This is now Alpha Foxtrot 29000.

06:06.788 --> 06:09.114
Don't get into this
pissing contest, Agent Todd.

06:09.207 --> 06:10.867
As you pointed out,
the President's gone.

06:10.959 --> 06:14.245
- It's no longer a Secret Service problem.
- Look, this could be a natural death

06:14.338 --> 06:16.578
or it could be a botched attempt
to murder the President.

06:16.632 --> 06:18.873
Until I know which, it's my problem.

06:18.967 --> 06:21.458
I don't give a damn
which one of you is boss,

06:21.553 --> 06:24.388
you ain't moving this body
until the ME says you can.

06:24.473 --> 06:27.094
- You talking about me, Elmo?
- Hello, Ducky.

06:27.184 --> 06:29.223
How'd you like
those steaks I air-expressed you?

06:29.770 --> 06:31.561
Delicious.

06:32.147 --> 06:34.223
He air-expressed him steaks?

06:35.400 --> 06:38.070
It's a big state.
Look how long it took him to get here.

06:38.153 --> 06:41.356
Agent Fornell here is FBI.
Agent Todd's Secret Service.

06:41.448 --> 06:44.983
Ducky, they're fighting over this body
like two hounds over a T-bone.

06:45.077 --> 06:47.864
Well, it's our T-bone for the moment.

06:48.330 --> 06:51.035
All these LEOs are contaminating
a potential crime scene.

06:51.124 --> 06:52.535
Yeah, my assistant's right.

06:52.626 --> 06:56.161
Everyone who boarded in Wichita
will have to evacuate the plane.

06:56.254 --> 06:57.962
I'm not going anywhere.

06:58.048 --> 06:59.590
I flew in on it.

06:59.716 --> 07:04.010
Very well. You two can stay.
But everyone else must deplane.

07:04.096 --> 07:06.016
All right, you heard the ME.
Let's move it, boys.

07:06.056 --> 07:07.087
- Got it.
- Okay.

07:07.182 --> 07:09.175
Ducky, what do you think?

07:09.518 --> 07:11.676
There's no outward sign of trauma.

07:11.770 --> 07:14.178
He was stricken
after having lunch with the President.

07:14.272 --> 07:16.064
Yeah, how is the President?

07:16.149 --> 07:17.264
He's fine.

07:17.359 --> 07:19.731
His physician cleared him
to fly on to LA.

07:19.820 --> 07:21.230
What happened?

07:23.573 --> 07:25.233
When the Commander
returned from lunch,

07:25.325 --> 07:26.819
he had an equilibrium problem,

07:26.910 --> 07:29.828
and his grip was too weak
to hold his briefcase.

07:29.913 --> 07:32.404
Did he gradually become ill

07:33.250 --> 07:34.744
or was it sudden?

07:34.835 --> 07:37.954
Sudden. He started to convulse
and collapsed.

07:38.046 --> 07:41.249
The President's physician believed
that the Commander had a stroke.

07:41.341 --> 07:45.754
- Kind of young for a brain fart.
- Looks like a natural death to me, Elmo.

07:46.680 --> 07:49.634
They can leave with the body
as long as they sign releases.

07:49.725 --> 07:51.100
Why the hell didn't you say that?

07:51.184 --> 07:53.758
Couldn't. Like I said,
it's the ME's decision.

07:53.854 --> 07:55.396
Release forms are in my car.

07:55.480 --> 07:57.140
Let's go. We can work out jurisdiction

07:57.232 --> 07:59.984
with Washington
on the flight to Andrews.

08:00.819 --> 08:04.568
Ducky? About those
soft-shelled crabs...

08:07.200 --> 08:10.035
You'll have them by the weekend.

08:10.620 --> 08:12.115
10-4, partner.

08:17.252 --> 08:18.331
Tony, go on.

08:18.420 --> 08:21.255
Show the pilot your credentials,
get us the hell out of here.

08:21.339 --> 08:24.590
Hey! Cockpit's on the top deck.

08:24.676 --> 08:26.051
I knew that.

08:28.263 --> 08:30.256
Did you enjoy playing my boss?

08:30.348 --> 08:32.922
- I did, rather.
- What do you think happened, Duck?

08:33.018 --> 08:35.591
Good God, Gibbs.
I've barely met the deceased.

08:35.687 --> 08:39.767
I think DiNozzo's right.
A naval aviator stroking at his age?

08:40.107 --> 08:41.852
He could have been born
with an aneurysm.

08:41.943 --> 08:43.687
They're time bombs in the body.

08:43.779 --> 08:46.151
I remember
this young promising basso profundo

08:46.239 --> 08:47.354
in London.

08:47.449 --> 08:50.865
He was only 27 when he keeled over
in the middle of an Otello aria.

08:50.952 --> 08:52.826
Who the hell are you people?

08:52.913 --> 08:54.905
You're no ME assistant.

08:55.123 --> 08:57.697
And there's not
a soft-shell crab within 1,000 miles.

08:57.793 --> 08:58.872
Sorry.

08:59.211 --> 09:00.409
NCIS.

09:01.254 --> 09:03.876
We flew down here from Washington
to take over the investigation.

09:03.965 --> 09:06.172
First the FBI tries to muscle in
and now NCIS.

09:06.259 --> 09:09.260
Yeah, well, I do believe
this is a dead naval officer...

09:09.346 --> 09:12.097
Who died on Air Force One
after having lunch with the President

09:12.182 --> 09:13.297
it's my job to protect.

09:13.391 --> 09:16.262
Okay, we can share jurisdiction.
You can be on my team.

09:16.353 --> 09:18.595
Your team?
Why should you have the investigation?

09:18.688 --> 09:20.764
Have you ever worked
a crime scene, Agent Todd?

09:20.857 --> 09:22.850
I am a Secret Service agent.

09:22.943 --> 09:25.860
- I thought not.
- Well, don't dismiss me like that.

09:25.946 --> 09:28.022
Okay, I earned my jock strap.

09:28.115 --> 09:30.950
Yeah? Does it ever give you
that empty feeling?

09:31.034 --> 09:33.027
- What?
- Your jock strap.

09:33.161 --> 09:34.192
No.

09:34.287 --> 09:37.822
Like some species of frogs,
I grow what I need.

09:38.333 --> 09:40.741
Gibbs, the pilot won't take off

09:40.836 --> 09:43.706
till the Secret Service chick gives us the

09:44.297 --> 09:45.626
thumbs up.

09:47.134 --> 09:48.544
I think that just made it my team.

09:48.635 --> 09:52.218
No. I think it means
I just have to hijack Air Force One.

09:52.305 --> 09:56.469
Tony? Escort Agent Todd
off this aircraft and close the hatch.

09:56.560 --> 09:59.644
You're not serious!
Wait! Wait, okay! Okay!

10:01.439 --> 10:02.638
Your team.

10:02.732 --> 10:04.642
But only because
I don't wanna delay us further

10:04.734 --> 10:06.526
by having to shoot you.

10:14.161 --> 10:16.486
Damn it, Agent Todd!
Let's get this show on the road!

10:16.580 --> 10:19.664
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.
We overbooked the flight.

10:19.749 --> 10:21.789
What the hell are you doing?

10:22.919 --> 10:25.161
What's going on? Stop!

10:28.175 --> 10:30.844
All right, do you know
what the hell's going on?

10:30.927 --> 10:34.296
Guess Ducky decided
to take the body to Washington.

10:34.389 --> 10:37.556
Why is your medical examiner
taking the body to Washington?

10:37.642 --> 10:40.347
Never said he was
my medical examiner.

10:48.111 --> 10:50.519
Then who the hell's
medical examiner is he?

10:50.614 --> 10:53.484
Ducky? He works for NCIS.

11:09.865 --> 11:13.565
Did you have to, literally
slam a door on the FBI's face?

11:13.660 --> 11:15.902
There were more of them than us.

11:16.121 --> 11:17.912
There's always more of them than us.

11:17.998 --> 11:20.405
You ever hear
of interagency cooperation?

11:20.500 --> 11:21.532
Yes, sir.

11:21.627 --> 11:24.082
I got the Secret Service
agent in charge at Wichita

11:24.171 --> 11:26.210
to agree to share the investigation.

11:26.298 --> 11:27.578
Willingly?

11:27.674 --> 11:30.592
Well, we could use a little backup
when we land at Andrews.

11:30.677 --> 11:32.088
That's what I thought.

11:32.179 --> 11:34.670
We're spread a bit thin.
We haven't got enough agents.

11:34.765 --> 11:38.465
If the FBI gets this body,
we won't see an autopsy report

11:38.560 --> 11:41.265
till after they leak it
to the Washington Post.

11:41.355 --> 11:43.561
Then make sure they don't get it.

11:44.316 --> 11:47.601
Will this Secret Service agent
stand up to the FBI?

11:47.694 --> 11:50.232
I don't know. She's got balls.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.109
Are you starting the autopsy?

11:55.202 --> 11:56.660
Goodness, no.

11:56.745 --> 11:59.153
I'm just taking his liver temperature

11:59.247 --> 12:01.573
to corroborate the time of death.

12:01.958 --> 12:04.710
The President's physician
declared him dead

12:04.795 --> 12:06.372
at 2032 Zulu.

12:06.463 --> 12:09.298
Yeah, it never hurts to double-check.

12:10.467 --> 12:12.210
Excuse me, you'll need to stand clear

12:12.302 --> 12:15.303
so I can take measurements
for my crime scene sketches. Thanks.

12:15.389 --> 12:17.962
Sketches? You've taken a dozen photos.

12:24.314 --> 12:26.271
Tell me her measurements.

12:26.566 --> 12:28.606
- You're pathetic.
- No, I'm serious.

12:28.694 --> 12:32.145
Can you tell if she's 5'4" and a 34C

12:32.239 --> 12:35.074
or 5'7" and a 36D?

12:36.034 --> 12:38.323
You can't. Not from a photo.

12:38.495 --> 12:41.864
That's why we do sketches
and take measurements. Thanks.

12:41.957 --> 12:45.705
I get 1915 Zulu.
That's nearly an hour earlier.

12:46.169 --> 12:48.126
Well, then, you miscalculated.

12:49.673 --> 12:50.835
What's the problem?

12:50.924 --> 12:54.008
There's apparently a discrepancy
between my time of death

12:54.094 --> 12:55.672
and the President's physician's.

12:55.762 --> 12:57.007
Log yours.

12:57.097 --> 13:00.014
Enough sketches, Tony. Agent Todd's
gonna give you a floor plan.

13:00.100 --> 13:01.843
Oh, no, she won't.

13:02.185 --> 13:05.352
I thought
your photo analysis was brilliant, Tony.

13:05.897 --> 13:08.934
But isn't 36D a bit of wishful thinking?

13:10.193 --> 13:11.225
You think?

13:11.319 --> 13:13.027
What can you tell me
about Commander Trapp?

13:13.113 --> 13:16.149
I can't give him Air Force One
floor plans. They're top-secret.

13:16.241 --> 13:18.198
Come on.
I saw this in a Harrison Ford movie.

13:18.285 --> 13:21.239
Well, that's Hollywood speculation.
You're asking for the real thing.

13:21.329 --> 13:23.210
Isn't the President's head
down here some place?

13:23.248 --> 13:24.363
No.

13:24.875 --> 13:26.867
No, this is in the movie.

13:27.502 --> 13:29.874
Yeah! Harrison was sitting right here!

13:29.963 --> 13:32.043
I can't risk those plans
getting out on the Internet.

13:32.132 --> 13:34.041
NCIS does not leak.

13:35.051 --> 13:38.052
If these plans get out,
you can shoot DiNozzo.

13:38.722 --> 13:41.509
No, I think I'm destined to shoot you.

13:42.058 --> 13:44.384
- What about Commander Trapp?
- Only met him this morning.

13:44.478 --> 13:46.038
He just received
his Yankee White clearance

13:46.062 --> 13:48.269
and was Major Kerry's backup.
The major has the flu.

13:48.356 --> 13:50.266
We'll have to get a navy doc
to verify that.

13:50.358 --> 13:51.556
He's got it.

13:51.651 --> 13:53.893
But go ahead and waste a doctor's time

13:53.987 --> 13:55.398
double-checking like your Ducky.

13:55.489 --> 13:57.861
This is where the terrorists
got their weapons in the movie.

13:57.949 --> 14:01.532
Oh, that is as ridiculous
as the President's escape capsule.

14:01.620 --> 14:03.446
Nobody switched planes
with the President?

14:03.538 --> 14:05.412
The press was put on a separate plane.

14:05.499 --> 14:07.787
Everyone else boarded the backup
except three stewards

14:07.876 --> 14:09.454
who I put in the press cabin.

14:09.544 --> 14:12.214
What did you keep them for?
Make coffee?

14:13.381 --> 14:15.302
I may not know
the finer points of investigating,

14:15.383 --> 14:16.842
like sticking needles in liver

14:16.927 --> 14:18.884
or, you know,
measuring swimsuit models,

14:18.970 --> 14:21.592
but I do know enough to hold the
stewards who prepared and served

14:21.681 --> 14:23.140
- the President's lunch.
- Okay.

14:23.225 --> 14:25.536
- Do you wanna question them?
- No, they're not going anywhere.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.220
We got a crime scene to investigate.

14:27.312 --> 14:30.895
Rule number one:
Never let suspects stay together.

14:30.982 --> 14:34.232
- Well, I didn't consider them suspects.
- Then why did you hold them?

14:34.319 --> 14:35.730
Put these on.

14:36.154 --> 14:38.028
My fingerprints are all over this aircraft.

14:38.114 --> 14:40.866
Rule number two:
Always wear gloves at a crime scene.

14:40.951 --> 14:44.900
I believe I know why there's
a discrepancy in the time of death.

14:45.121 --> 14:48.241
Now, since the Commander
had lunch with the President,

14:48.333 --> 14:51.998
I'm sure the President's physician
rushed to evaluate his condition.

14:52.087 --> 14:54.874
He also called Trapp's time of death.

14:56.132 --> 14:59.916
Yes. Once he was sure that the
President wasn't in medical danger,

15:00.011 --> 15:01.470
he returned

15:02.764 --> 15:04.721
and he was gone nearly an hour.

15:04.808 --> 15:06.385
Yes, I'm sure the autopsy will show

15:06.476 --> 15:09.050
that Commander Trapp
expired almost immediately.

15:09.145 --> 15:13.309
- I owe you an apology, Doctor.
- Please, it's Ducky to my associates.

15:13.650 --> 15:15.856
I'm just relieved we straightened it out.

15:15.944 --> 15:19.277
It's inconsistencies like this,
start conspiracy theories.

15:19.364 --> 15:22.448
It reminds me of a case once
in New Orleans.

15:22.617 --> 15:25.535
A jealous husband
shot his wife off a Mardi Gras float

15:25.620 --> 15:27.849
right under the clock
at the corner of Basin street and...

15:27.873 --> 15:30.992
Come on, Duck, give it a rest.
She's got work to do.

15:31.626 --> 15:33.453
I'll tell you the rest later.

15:33.545 --> 15:37.245
Rule number three: Don't believe
what you're told. Double-check.

15:37.340 --> 15:39.214
Should I write these rules
in my Palm Pilot

15:39.301 --> 15:40.843
or crochet them on pillows?

15:41.678 --> 15:42.923
Oh, no!

15:43.013 --> 15:46.179
I draw the line
at him sitting in the President's chair.

15:46.266 --> 15:47.345
He's not using it.

15:47.434 --> 15:48.465
- Gibbs.
- Fine.

15:48.560 --> 15:51.477
If you're finished taking pictures,
start bagging and tagging.

15:51.563 --> 15:53.555
Just waiting for you, boss.

15:53.773 --> 15:57.901
- Oh, bagging and tagging what?
- Well, to start with, everything.

15:58.445 --> 16:00.318
The President was sitting there?

16:00.405 --> 16:02.978
Pretty good bet since it is his desk.

16:05.535 --> 16:08.370
Okay, maintain the chain of custody.

16:08.455 --> 16:11.705
Take the item,
in this case Commander Trapp's lunch.

16:12.042 --> 16:14.200
Place it in the evidence bag.

16:15.128 --> 16:16.408
Seal it.

16:17.047 --> 16:19.372
Record all pertinent information.

16:19.466 --> 16:24.044
Initial across the seal. Keep it cold.

16:25.555 --> 16:27.595
Okay, why don't you try it?

16:29.768 --> 16:31.559
Whoa! Wait a minute!

16:33.355 --> 16:38.147
Hey, wait! Wait a minute!
Hey, whoa! Stop! In here! In here!

16:50.413 --> 16:53.248
Could I rinse
now that you got your evidence?

16:53.333 --> 16:54.661
Yeah, sure.

17:02.425 --> 17:04.334
Log it. Go find Ducky.

17:04.970 --> 17:07.805
You think she's got
whatever killed the Commander?

17:23.113 --> 17:26.445
Please join me in welcoming
President George W. Bush.

17:29.327 --> 17:31.901
Don't threaten me, Tom.
I'm not in your food chain.

17:31.997 --> 17:35.745
If NCIS does the autopsy,
they'll control the investigation.

17:35.834 --> 17:39.368
- You want that?
- Commander Trapp was a naval officer.

17:39.462 --> 17:41.289
They have every right to do the autopsy.

17:41.381 --> 17:42.496
Thank you all.

17:42.590 --> 17:44.250
Damn it, Bill, they're bush league.

17:44.342 --> 17:46.750
We've got assets
those cowboys can only salivate over.

17:46.845 --> 17:48.884
Don't underestimate NCIS.

17:48.972 --> 17:50.086
No, they're good.

17:50.181 --> 17:52.755
Making drug busts,
catching sailors who jump ship,

17:52.851 --> 17:54.179
but an attack on the President?

17:54.269 --> 17:57.768
The President's doctor thought
that Commander Trapp had a stroke.

17:57.856 --> 17:59.314
Maybe he did.

17:59.691 --> 18:02.941
But, if he was poisoned,
you willing to put the man's life

18:03.028 --> 18:05.519
in the hands
of retread cops and ex-MPs?

18:05.613 --> 18:06.942
Go ahead and be seated.

18:07.032 --> 18:10.151
If you withhold so much as a comma
out of the report...

18:10.243 --> 18:12.304
You'll get copies
of everything before the ink dries.

18:12.328 --> 18:15.579
I'll order Agent Todd to turn
the body over to the FBI at Andrews,

18:15.665 --> 18:18.156
but I can't control NCIS.

18:18.251 --> 18:21.786
With us joined at the hip,
all they can do is watch and bitch.

18:22.672 --> 18:23.787
We're back in the ballgame.

18:26.092 --> 18:27.586
No temperature.

18:28.470 --> 18:30.509
I think it's a stomach virus.

18:30.597 --> 18:32.008
I know it is.

18:33.349 --> 18:36.054
Did you use that thermometer
on cadavers?

18:36.478 --> 18:39.099
Would you rather I use the liver probe?

18:39.189 --> 18:41.644
Why are you so sure it was the flu?

18:45.403 --> 18:48.772
It's the same symptoms
Major Kerry had.

18:49.741 --> 18:51.983
Well, did you work together recently?

18:52.077 --> 18:53.108
No.

18:53.912 --> 18:56.663
Well, if you didn't work with him,
then how...

19:00.168 --> 19:02.326
Did you think I was a virgin?

19:02.504 --> 19:04.295
I'd hoped not.

19:22.565 --> 19:26.065
You gonna lecture me about sleeping
with people you work with?

19:26.152 --> 19:27.231
Nope.

19:32.742 --> 19:36.028
Agent Todd, Agent Baer's
on the secure line for you.

19:44.295 --> 19:46.668
Want me to take that call for you?

19:48.049 --> 19:49.792
I'd have to be dead.

19:58.643 --> 20:00.552
And how long you been
on Air Force One?

20:00.645 --> 20:02.187
Five years, sir.

20:02.272 --> 20:05.273
Two with President Clinton,
three with President Bush.

20:06.901 --> 20:08.182
All right.

20:08.903 --> 20:10.896
Well, thank you very much,
Chief Steward.

20:10.989 --> 20:12.317
Yes, sir.

20:14.576 --> 20:17.411
- What'd you get?
- Food security is very tight.

20:17.495 --> 20:20.117
Incognito purchases.
Randomly selected stores.

20:20.206 --> 20:22.993
No one knows they're buying
for Air Force One.

20:24.252 --> 20:26.743
The stewards usually
prepare all the food,

20:26.838 --> 20:30.254
but today the President
had ribs and coleslaw

20:30.550 --> 20:33.420
flown in from a smokehouse
in San Antonio.

20:34.095 --> 20:37.298
So they only reheated them
and served them.

20:37.849 --> 20:40.091
- Anybody else have ribs?
- No.

20:40.518 --> 20:42.178
Gibbs, if the ribs were poisoned,

20:42.270 --> 20:44.642
how come the President
wasn't affected?

20:44.731 --> 20:47.400
Maybe he's used to
Papa Joe's barbecue.

20:48.401 --> 20:50.296
You two are through
taking pictures of each other

20:50.320 --> 20:52.526
maybe we can move that body aft.

20:55.617 --> 20:59.116
I made a deal with NCIS
to share the investigation, sir.

20:59.204 --> 21:01.908
You're not senior enough
to make deals, Agent Todd.

21:01.998 --> 21:04.370
We're working this with the FBI.

21:04.584 --> 21:07.787
Sir, these NCIS agents
are not just gonna turn the body

21:07.879 --> 21:09.456
and evidence over to the FBI.

21:09.547 --> 21:10.745
Let's go!

21:12.967 --> 21:17.261
NCIS had no right to use
a local coroner to delay your departure.

21:17.513 --> 21:18.972
You have to see it from their side.

21:19.057 --> 21:20.088
Agent Todd,

21:20.183 --> 21:21.807
shut up and listen!

21:21.893 --> 21:24.810
I'm giving you a direct order.
That's our aircraft.

21:24.896 --> 21:28.395
Everything living and dead on board
is under Secret Service control.

21:28.483 --> 21:30.808
Turn the body over
to the FBI at Andrews

21:30.902 --> 21:34.900
or the only presidential detail you'll get
will be walking Spotty.

21:50.964 --> 21:52.588
Where's the body?

21:54.133 --> 21:55.628
I don't know.

22:02.934 --> 22:05.888
You move it to the aft ramp
for a fast getaway?

22:10.525 --> 22:12.268
It won't work, Gibbs.

22:16.114 --> 22:20.063
I've been ordered to turn the body over
to the FBI at Andrews.

22:20.410 --> 22:23.197
Hey, you could stall them
until we get it off.

22:23.288 --> 22:26.454
No, I can't. I won't defy a direct order.

22:29.043 --> 22:30.419
I'm sorry, Gibbs.

22:30.503 --> 22:32.377
Never say you're sorry.

22:32.714 --> 22:33.793
I...

22:34.382 --> 22:36.838
You don't have to crochet that one.

22:39.679 --> 22:41.671
Folks, please fasten your seat belts.

22:41.764 --> 22:45.014
We're beginning our descent
into Andrews at this time.

23:03.010 --> 23:06.710
Why'd you let NCIS have
the evidence they bagged on the plane?

23:06.805 --> 23:09.379
Since we have the body,
we control the investigation.

23:09.475 --> 23:13.259
If a few ribs and coleslaw
saves them face, what does it hurt?

23:13.604 --> 23:16.521
If the food was poisoned,
the President would...

23:17.691 --> 23:19.399
It's not mine, sir.

23:20.819 --> 23:22.859
- Mine either.
- Hello?

23:24.365 --> 23:27.282
We're in the clear.
You can get out of the body bag.

23:31.538 --> 23:34.290
I never thought I'd say this,
but I'm not sure I want to.

23:34.375 --> 23:37.376
Why? You gotta search
Commander Trapp's apartment tonight.

23:37.461 --> 23:39.418
Oh, Gibbs, come on. It's 1:00 a.m.

23:39.505 --> 23:43.372
Agent Axelrod is trailing you
to pick up the body bag

23:43.467 --> 23:45.045
when the FBI tosses it.

23:45.135 --> 23:48.006
That's funny, Gibbs.
Real funny. Especially since...

23:50.057 --> 23:51.848
I guess they found him.

23:53.686 --> 23:57.470
Special Agent Gibbs has been operating
under my direct orders.

23:58.232 --> 24:00.639
Agent Todd was also operating
under orders.

24:00.734 --> 24:02.442
As was Agent Fornell.

24:02.528 --> 24:04.935
Then the problem seems to be
that my man succeeded

24:05.030 --> 24:06.904
where your two didn't.

24:07.574 --> 24:10.362
Tom, this is no time for turf wars.

24:11.078 --> 24:12.620
Not after 9/11.

24:12.997 --> 24:15.748
And especially
when the President's life may be at risk.

24:15.833 --> 24:18.787
I like to think this is
not about turf, Mark.

24:19.294 --> 24:22.710
Rather that we all believe
we have the right people for the job.

24:22.798 --> 24:24.874
We shouldn't be agency directors
if we didn't.

24:24.967 --> 24:27.540
You're offering a shared investigation?

24:28.053 --> 24:30.461
- I am.
- Who leads? Your man?

24:31.306 --> 24:33.050
We do have the body.

24:34.143 --> 24:37.512
- I found Abby. She's on her way in.
- Yeah, did you wake her up?

24:37.604 --> 24:41.270
No, called her on her cell.
Sounded like one phat party.

24:43.569 --> 24:45.027
Find anything, Ducky?

24:45.112 --> 24:47.151
Nope, and I won't for hours.

24:47.698 --> 24:50.403
I've just begun examining the body
for needle marks.

24:50.492 --> 24:51.773
Think somebody stuck him?

24:51.869 --> 24:53.861
- I don't know.
- Anything on the uniform?

24:53.954 --> 24:56.872
Not that I could see. I sent it up to Abby.

24:56.999 --> 24:58.374
What's this?

25:01.211 --> 25:02.456
A mole.

25:04.089 --> 25:07.624
Gibbs, go home. Get some sleep.

25:07.968 --> 25:09.711
I would if I could.

25:10.471 --> 25:12.759
This is gonna take all night.

25:14.600 --> 25:16.509
Or what's left of it.

25:33.452 --> 25:34.567
Ducky?

25:36.246 --> 25:38.405
Why would Abby go to a phat party?

25:38.791 --> 25:41.708
Jethro, get some sleep.

25:54.431 --> 25:55.594
Abby?

25:56.100 --> 25:57.131
Yeah?

25:57.601 --> 26:00.174
- Find anything on his uniform?
- Not yet.

26:00.270 --> 26:02.429
Well, I think I found
how he was poisoned.

26:05.317 --> 26:08.603
This guy had enough vitamins,
herbs and organic food

26:08.695 --> 26:10.273
to open his own health market.

26:10.364 --> 26:14.278
If he was poisoned, I think you'll find it
laced into one of these.

26:14.368 --> 26:18.366
So what are you gonna do while
I'm finding poison in a health snack?

26:19.373 --> 26:20.748
I'll wait.

26:22.042 --> 26:24.747
There's a futon
by the cabinet over there.

26:24.837 --> 26:27.162
Oh, bless you.

26:28.257 --> 26:30.166
What are you, my priest?

26:30.384 --> 26:31.712
Curse you?

26:40.018 --> 26:41.561
Oh, yeah.

26:47.609 --> 26:50.610
My neuropathology exam
indicates that our victim

26:50.696 --> 26:54.314
succumbed to a cerebral embolism
here in the parietal lobe.

26:54.408 --> 26:56.733
I also found a number of clots,

26:56.827 --> 26:59.199
most of them centered
in the renal artery.

26:59.288 --> 27:00.402
Isn't that unusual?

27:00.497 --> 27:03.534
Oh, not at all.
In most cases of arterial thrombosis,

27:03.625 --> 27:06.412
clots will develop
over a period of minutes or hours,

27:06.503 --> 27:07.962
spread to the rest of the body.

27:08.046 --> 27:10.882
But what caused them to develop
in a healthy young aviator?

27:10.966 --> 27:14.252
- Abby?
- Well, I did a fibrinogen test.

27:14.428 --> 27:17.263
The procoagulant numbers were high,
but they weren't off the charts.

27:17.347 --> 27:19.636
Any drugs that might have
induced clotting?

27:19.725 --> 27:22.394
Well, yeah.
But none of those popped up.

27:22.477 --> 27:23.888
I only isoed the epinephrine

27:23.979 --> 27:26.249
that was injected when he got
juled and juiced on the plane.

27:26.273 --> 27:29.190
- No vitamins, herbals?
- Well, the guy was an organic freak.

27:29.276 --> 27:30.628
I mean, he probably whizzed green.

27:30.652 --> 27:32.380
But none of that
will cottage cheese your blood.

27:32.404 --> 27:34.977
Did you test the food
that he ingested on Air Force One?

27:35.073 --> 27:37.113
Everything that was bagged and tagged.

27:37.201 --> 27:40.320
It was ribs, coleslaw, barby sauce,
it was all negative for toxins.

27:40.412 --> 27:43.199
I mean, that stuff will kill you,
but it'll take, like, 30 years.

27:43.290 --> 27:45.291
Do you dudes
in the Secret Service ever think about

27:45.375 --> 27:48.412
throwing yourselves
in front of the President's diet?

27:49.379 --> 27:52.546
So, you're both saying
he wasn't murdered?

27:52.674 --> 27:56.458
No, however freakish and tragic,
it apparently was a natural death.

27:56.595 --> 27:58.338
I want my people to check your results.

27:58.430 --> 28:02.677
Of course. You and Agent Todd
will be receiving copies of all our tests.

28:03.018 --> 28:04.512
Does it for me.

28:06.939 --> 28:08.516
How's your butt?

28:09.191 --> 28:11.563
It's still bouncing on the beltway.

28:11.652 --> 28:12.731
Kate?

28:21.370 --> 28:23.528
When's the President returning?

28:23.622 --> 28:26.742
Tomorrow, noon. I'm flying back tonight
to rejoin the detail.

28:26.833 --> 28:28.541
Mind if I tag along?

28:30.796 --> 28:32.041
Please?

28:33.715 --> 28:37.167
You can, your SIG Sauer can't.
We have a rule.

28:37.261 --> 28:40.427
No weapons on Air Force One
unless you're Secret Service.

28:52.776 --> 28:54.270
Keep looking.

28:55.362 --> 28:56.477
Wow.

28:56.947 --> 28:58.690
Gibbs said "please."

29:00.450 --> 29:02.194
To Commander Trapp.

29:07.749 --> 29:09.811
To come all the way
through the war without a scratch

29:09.835 --> 29:11.708
and die of a stroke...

29:12.754 --> 29:15.376
He was in the thick of it
on the push to Baghdad.

29:15.465 --> 29:17.090
You never told me that you knew him.

29:17.175 --> 29:19.464
We had a drink
when he reported to the White House.

29:19.553 --> 29:21.193
Wanted to know what tips
I could give him.

29:21.263 --> 29:23.006
About the football detail?

29:23.098 --> 29:25.221
That, or he could find
a good gym,

29:25.309 --> 29:27.431
dry cleaners, grocery mart,

29:28.687 --> 29:31.937
- local watering hole.
- Did you tell him about this place?

29:32.024 --> 29:33.055
No.

29:34.568 --> 29:35.599
He might have run into us

29:35.694 --> 29:38.149
and that wouldn't have been good,
would it?

29:38.238 --> 29:40.029
No, it wouldn't.

29:48.206 --> 29:51.622
He wouldn't have run into us
after tonight, though, would he?

29:51.710 --> 29:52.741
No.

29:55.464 --> 29:57.670
Worried about losing your job?

29:59.843 --> 30:02.168
Worried about losing a President.

30:02.429 --> 30:06.296
When we work together, my focus,
it just wouldn't be 100%.

30:08.727 --> 30:10.269
I'm sorry, Tim.

30:10.729 --> 30:13.599
That's the way it's gotta be
and you know it.

30:59.459 --> 31:02.709
Good to see you again, Major.
Always good to see you.

31:02.796 --> 31:05.252
Well, folks, that was a job well done.

31:05.382 --> 31:07.303
- Thank you, sir.
- What do you say we head home?

31:07.342 --> 31:09.750
- Absolutely.
- All right. I agree.

31:10.595 --> 31:12.220
Sir, I'm surprised

31:12.305 --> 31:14.385
that you didn't object
to agent Gibbs riding with us.

31:14.474 --> 31:17.760
He's here because his gut
is still churning, isn't it?

31:17.978 --> 31:20.848
Yes, sir.
I suppose you could put it that way.

31:21.690 --> 31:23.314
Well, so is mine.

31:30.282 --> 31:32.607
Ducky, I have tested everything.

31:32.701 --> 31:36.912
Mineral acids, organic acids,
alkaloids, bacterial poisons.

31:37.039 --> 31:38.201
You know, Abby,

31:38.290 --> 31:41.789
nature always proves
to be a far more illusive

31:41.877 --> 31:44.664
and powerful killer than man.

31:52.220 --> 31:53.964
Expect him to drop?

31:59.561 --> 32:01.601
I see you're over the flu.

32:03.023 --> 32:06.392
24-hour bug. Tim got over it yesterday.

32:09.321 --> 32:11.029
Tim is Major Kerry.

32:11.990 --> 32:14.066
Yeah, kind of figured that.

32:16.078 --> 32:18.319
I met him for a drink yesterday.

32:18.747 --> 32:21.617
I told him
we had to stop seeing each other.

32:22.918 --> 32:25.325
I mean, we hadn't been dating long.

32:25.462 --> 32:27.371
I mean,
we knew each other on the detail

32:27.464 --> 32:30.133
for a couple months before we started

32:31.176 --> 32:32.421
dating.

32:35.847 --> 32:40.390
You know, when you're on the job 24/7,
how else do you get to know someone?

32:41.520 --> 32:42.765
Church.

33:02.499 --> 33:03.578
- Emmy?
- Yes?

33:03.667 --> 33:06.039
The President's ready to see you.

33:19.057 --> 33:20.717
Where are they going?

33:20.809 --> 33:24.012
The President promised 10 minutes
to each member of the press on board.

33:24.104 --> 33:27.639
Since we kicked them off at Wichita,
he's playing catch-up.

33:28.483 --> 33:29.764
Three years before 9/11

33:29.860 --> 33:33.026
Clancy wrote a book where a terrorist
hijacked a commercial jetliner

33:33.113 --> 33:34.856
and crashed it into the Capitol.

33:34.948 --> 33:37.024
In the Harrison Ford movie,

33:37.576 --> 33:39.533
terrorists were reporters.

33:39.703 --> 33:44.530
Gibbs, everyone aboard
has been vetted by us for years,

33:45.375 --> 33:46.750
except you.

33:49.546 --> 33:52.547
In the film,
the terrorists got their credentials

33:52.632 --> 33:54.874
from a Secret Service turncoat.

34:01.558 --> 34:04.049
Loosening up your dress code, Kate?

34:04.728 --> 34:05.890
He's not one of us.

34:05.979 --> 34:07.722
We all gonna get
our 15 minutes of fame?

34:07.814 --> 34:10.981
It's 10, Leonard,
and the president's doing his best.

34:46.895 --> 34:49.219
Agent DiNozzo, NCIS. What do you got?

34:49.313 --> 34:52.018
One dead marine officer.
No signs of trauma.

34:52.108 --> 34:53.377
It doesn't appear to be a robbery.

34:53.400 --> 34:56.272
There's still cash and credit cards
in his wallet.

34:56.362 --> 34:58.604
I've got two shootings already
this morning.

34:58.698 --> 35:01.901
Since this guy's one of yours,
I hoped you might take him.

35:05.205 --> 35:06.747
Yeah, we'll take him.

35:12.545 --> 35:13.577
Yes!

35:16.508 --> 35:19.129
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

35:19.594 --> 35:23.426
There is something different
about this plane and Air Force One.

35:23.807 --> 35:25.634
This is Air Force One.

35:25.976 --> 35:28.680
- You know what I mean.
- Leonard.

35:28.770 --> 35:30.395
There are some minor differences.

35:30.480 --> 35:33.730
29000 is newer
and has some minor updates.

35:35.068 --> 35:36.348
Like what?

35:39.281 --> 35:42.531
Rear loading hatch is bigger
on the 29000

35:42.701 --> 35:46.948
extra lavatory forward,
locks are digital in 29 and keyed on this.

35:47.038 --> 35:50.787
Special agent Gibbs, you have
a teleconference call in Comm.

35:51.418 --> 35:53.624
Kate, I wanna know
every difference on this plane

35:53.712 --> 35:56.119
no matter how small you think it is.

35:56.298 --> 35:57.460
Please?

36:00.260 --> 36:02.965
- What's up?
- Major Kerry is dead.

36:03.054 --> 36:05.759
D.C. Cops found the body
in his car on a street in Georgetown.

36:05.849 --> 36:07.260
Ducky and Abby'll update you.

36:07.350 --> 36:08.726
Another stroke, Duck?

36:08.810 --> 36:09.925
I'm afraid so, Gibbs.

36:10.020 --> 36:13.353
But this time
there are multiple embolic infarctions.

36:13.481 --> 36:17.100
The Major must have received
a heavier dose than the Commander.

36:17.193 --> 36:18.308
Dose of what, Abby?

36:18.403 --> 36:20.775
It's venom from a Coastal Taipan.

36:20.864 --> 36:22.987
It's a highly toxic Aussie snake.

36:23.074 --> 36:25.861
Well, this junk zaps the nervous system
and it clots the blood.

36:25.952 --> 36:27.273
You convulse and then you stroke.

36:27.329 --> 36:29.866
The toxin is almost
impossible to detect.

36:29.956 --> 36:32.992
The truth is Abby would have detected it
if I hadn't interrupted her

36:33.084 --> 36:34.792
while she was A-L-S-ing the uniform.

36:34.878 --> 36:36.289
The venom was in the uniform?

36:36.379 --> 36:38.419
Yeah, I found traces of DMSO

36:38.506 --> 36:40.131
in the collars and the cuffs.

36:40.216 --> 36:42.458
I think it was mixed with the venom

36:42.552 --> 36:45.043
to make it absorb through the skin.

36:45.138 --> 36:46.846
Major Kerry was the intended target,

36:46.931 --> 36:48.176
but he came down with the flu.

36:48.266 --> 36:50.508
Didn't put his uniform on
until yesterday.

36:50.602 --> 36:52.974
How did the terrorists
get the poison into the uniforms?

36:53.063 --> 36:54.473
Well, they both have tags

36:54.564 --> 36:56.391
from Dry Dock Cleaners on 19th street.

36:56.483 --> 36:57.514
DiNozzo?

36:57.609 --> 36:59.045
Why are you sitting there on your ass?

36:59.069 --> 37:01.275
Get a team and go hit that dry cleaners.

37:01.363 --> 37:03.984
I've passed that baton to the FBI.

37:04.366 --> 37:06.987
This has all the earmarks of Al-Qaeda.

37:07.077 --> 37:10.576
Unexpected, well-planned,
brilliantly executed.

37:11.206 --> 37:12.486
But to what end?

37:12.582 --> 37:15.749
Wouldn't surprise me
to hear Bin Laden on Al-Jazeera

37:15.835 --> 37:18.373
bragging how he iced
the President's ball carriers.

37:18.463 --> 37:21.499
I don't think that's
what he wants to brag about.

37:22.175 --> 37:23.883
Yeah. Neither do I.

37:33.353 --> 37:35.144
Where did you get
your uniform dry-cleaned?

37:35.230 --> 37:37.436
Base cleaner at Quantico, sir.

37:42.195 --> 37:44.484
I've accessed everything I could
on the differences.

37:44.572 --> 37:46.197
- We need to talk.
- What are you doing?

37:46.282 --> 37:48.052
There's a campaign conference
going on in there.

37:48.076 --> 37:51.077
- I need to talk to you in private.
- There's no other private meeting room.

37:51.121 --> 37:53.041
You could ask
the President to give up his office

37:53.123 --> 37:54.266
but it might be a little weird.

37:54.290 --> 37:56.164
Hey! What are you doing?

37:56.292 --> 37:57.537
Hey!

37:57.669 --> 38:00.160
- Sit down!
- What are you doing?

38:02.632 --> 38:04.755
Commander Trapp was poisoned.

38:04.843 --> 38:09.505
Australian snake venom.
Hard to detect. Mimics a natural death.

38:12.642 --> 38:13.757
What? You think I did it?

38:13.852 --> 38:15.996
Well, sweet pea, you were with him
when he was poisoned.

38:16.020 --> 38:18.013
Yes, so was the President!
You gonna accuse him?

38:18.106 --> 38:22.104
No. He wasn't
with Major Kerry yesterday.

38:24.028 --> 38:25.439
- Tim?
- Yeah.

38:26.072 --> 38:28.361
Stroked on a Georgetown street.

38:30.702 --> 38:33.868
You know what? I'll bet it wasn't far
from the bar where you two kissed

38:33.955 --> 38:35.533
and said bye-bye.

38:38.460 --> 38:39.954
You asshole!

38:44.716 --> 38:46.376
Okay. Okay.

38:47.594 --> 38:50.713
Gave it to you cold.
Wanted to see your reaction.

38:52.056 --> 38:54.049
Liars can't pale on cue.

38:56.603 --> 38:57.883
Come on.

39:05.528 --> 39:07.402
You're still a bastard.

39:09.491 --> 39:10.866
How were they poisoned?

39:10.950 --> 39:13.821
Dry cleaner laced their uniforms
with poison.

39:14.078 --> 39:16.154
Must be an Al-Qaeda sleeper.

39:17.123 --> 39:20.290
Tim must have recommended
his dry cleaners. He...

39:21.794 --> 39:23.668
- What?
- Yesterday...

39:26.090 --> 39:27.549
Yesterday he had...

39:27.634 --> 39:29.875
Tim told me
that they had a drink and that he gave...

39:29.969 --> 39:32.591
He gave Commander Trapp
tips like that.

39:33.681 --> 39:35.282
Well, they gotta be after the President.

39:35.308 --> 39:37.265
What would killing the ball carrier
give them?

39:37.352 --> 39:39.843
Nothing. Another aide steps in.

39:41.940 --> 39:43.564
And another plane.

39:44.400 --> 39:45.729
This plane.

39:45.944 --> 39:48.565
They forced the President
to fly his backup.

39:48.655 --> 39:51.062
Well, security's exactly the same.

39:51.241 --> 39:53.032
But the plane isn't.

39:53.326 --> 39:56.243
And I'll bet security isn't either
until the President's on board.

39:56.329 --> 39:59.698
Al-Qaeda has to have planted
something on this plane.

40:00.625 --> 40:03.745
Okay, it can't be a bomb.
They would have detonated it by now.

40:06.756 --> 40:09.508
- Okay, wait. Stan!
- Are you all right?

40:09.592 --> 40:11.585
Oh, my God! Somebody help!

40:13.429 --> 40:15.552
Medical emergency. Press cabin.

40:22.564 --> 40:23.643
Out of the way!

40:23.731 --> 40:25.771
Captain, is this the same thing
Trapp had?

40:25.858 --> 40:28.266
- It appears to be.
- He's not breathing.

40:28.361 --> 40:30.437
- Start CPR.
- Do something!

40:47.213 --> 40:49.621
You said the locks were different.

40:50.216 --> 40:52.968
29 has digital ones.
This plane has keys.

40:55.138 --> 40:56.300
Armoury.

40:56.514 --> 40:59.005
The armoury.
They have keys to the armoury.

40:59.100 --> 41:01.140
They copied the movie.
They vetted a reporter.

41:01.227 --> 41:02.602
No, that would take years.

41:02.687 --> 41:04.561
- So did setting up 9/11.
- Shit!

41:05.982 --> 41:07.823
There's a medical emergency
in the press cabin.

41:07.900 --> 41:10.273
It's a diversion. Cover the President.

41:11.070 --> 41:12.814
Nobody gets past you!

41:26.878 --> 41:28.752
- Sir, stop right there!
- What's happening?

41:28.838 --> 41:30.482
- Stop right there, sir!
- What's happening?

41:30.506 --> 41:31.669
Freeze!

41:32.300 --> 41:34.292
Get your hands in the air!

41:34.552 --> 41:36.960
Sure. Someone yelled for a doctor.

41:44.937 --> 41:46.052
Down, down.

41:57.075 --> 41:58.320
You okay?

42:14.926 --> 42:16.835
I'm gonna be doing paperwork
for a week.

42:16.928 --> 42:18.671
Oh, yeah. Me, too.

42:18.763 --> 42:20.969
Agent Todd told me
about her and Major Kerry

42:21.057 --> 42:23.014
when she tendered her resignation.

42:23.101 --> 42:26.018
- You accepting?
- Of course. She broke the rules.

42:27.355 --> 42:30.024
Well, thank you, Special Agent Gibbs.

42:31.275 --> 42:32.520
No, sir.

42:33.653 --> 42:34.933
Thank you.

42:41.035 --> 42:43.242
I heard you quit, Agent Todd.

42:43.871 --> 42:47.121
Happy news gets around fast.
Yes, I resigned.

42:47.208 --> 42:51.075
- It was the right thing to do.
- Yep. Pull that crap at NCIS,

42:52.130 --> 42:54.621
I won't give you a chance to resign.

42:56.217 --> 42:57.960
Is that a job offer?

43:08.730 --> 43:12.561
Federal agents working
in unison with the Secret Service

43:12.692 --> 43:14.731
were able to foil a terrorist attempt

43:14.819 --> 43:18.437
to assassinate the President
while he was on board Air Force One.

43:18.531 --> 43:19.859
The body of the terrorist

43:19.949 --> 43:22.654
is being delivered to the
Armed Forces Institute of Pathology

43:22.744 --> 43:26.409
where FBI forensic experts
will endeavour to identify it.

43:26.497 --> 43:27.576
Was it Al-Qaeda?

43:27.665 --> 43:29.456
Yes, was there
any Al-Qaeda connection?

43:29.542 --> 43:31.535
That's all we know at this time.
