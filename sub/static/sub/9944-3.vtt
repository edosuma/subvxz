00:05.660 --> 00:08.173
Come and watch pikeys making a mess

00:08.260 --> 00:11.855
of the lives they were given by
'im upstairs...

00:11.940 --> 00:14.898
And kids they're convinced
aren't actually theirs.

00:14.980 --> 00:16.094
Wicked!

00:16.180 --> 00:17.499
Piss off!

00:17.580 --> 00:21.368
What sounds on Earth
could ever replace

00:21.460 --> 00:24.497
kids needing money
or wives in your face?

00:24.580 --> 00:26.935
Cos this, people reckon -
me included -

00:27.020 --> 00:29.488
is why pubs and drugs

00:29.580 --> 00:31.172
were kindly invented...

00:31.260 --> 00:33.774
To calm us all down
and stop us going mental.

00:33.860 --> 00:38.570
These are Chatsworth Estate's
basic essentials.

00:38.660 --> 00:44.815
We are worth every penny
for grinding your axes...

00:44.900 --> 00:46.379
You sit on our head,

00:46.460 --> 00:49.133
but... you pay the taxes.

00:49.220 --> 00:50.619
CHEERING

00:50.700 --> 00:53.373
Imagine Britain
without Chatsworth buccaneers

00:53.460 --> 00:56.691
who'd come on your face
for the price of a beer, eh?

00:56.780 --> 00:58.259
Eh!

00:58.340 --> 01:02.094
Make poverty history.
Cheaper drugs now!

01:02.180 --> 01:07.049
Make poverty history!
Cheaper drugs now!

'Sometimes by people who say

'There's no word for the worst thing
I've done. No single word.

'No insult.

'I don't suppose there's
any way I can make up for it.

02:19.220 --> 02:21.609
Told me mum I couldn't live
with the stench of me dad's feet.

02:21.700 --> 02:23.656
Had to believe that.

02:23.740 --> 02:27.892
Why don't you move back?
There's loads more space.

02:27.980 --> 02:29.174
Everybody...

02:29.260 --> 02:31.376
There's different types of space.

02:31.460 --> 02:33.052
I've got a little announcement to make.

02:33.140 --> 02:34.095
Mothers smother.

02:35.220 --> 02:38.690
I am gonna have another little baba.

02:38.780 --> 02:42.090
(AIl) Yeah!

02:49.340 --> 02:53.253
Well, we've been trying all this time,
ever since I come back.

02:53.340 --> 02:54.853
You could've fucking told me.

02:54.940 --> 02:57.932
Take it with you when you bugger off,
cos I'm not looking after it.

02:58.020 --> 02:59.817
- Where's it gonna go?
- (Liam) Not in ours.

02:59.900 --> 03:03.449
- We'll have to hope it's a girl, then.
- No chance, I'm not sharing!

03:06.060 --> 03:07.015
Congratulations.

03:07.100 --> 03:08.658
When's it due?

03:08.740 --> 03:10.970
Doctor'll tell us that,
when I get it confirmed.

03:11.060 --> 03:12.971
You've taken a test?

03:13.060 --> 03:17.770
I don't need to. I've had me visions -
nursery rhymes, birds, eggs.

03:19.460 --> 03:24.693
No, I am most definitely with child.

03:33.580 --> 03:37.255
Best nosh, a night in the finest hotel,

03:37.340 --> 03:39.410
baked in luxury,

03:39.500 --> 03:42.572
a 40th birthday
to go down in history.

03:42.660 --> 03:44.855
- Wish you'd let us join in.
- Yeah. It's not fair.

03:44.940 --> 03:46.737
You can get us a pressie.

03:46.820 --> 03:47.775
Aye, a big'un.

03:47.860 --> 03:50.658
We should have a fucking big bash
or summat. Hardcore.

03:50.740 --> 03:52.492
My Paddy's planned this,

03:52.580 --> 03:54.218
which means it's perfect.

03:54.300 --> 03:57.019
CHUCKLES

03:57.100 --> 04:00.331
You toddling off into town?

04:00.420 --> 04:02.615
Dunno if I can be bothered.

04:02.700 --> 04:04.975
OK, maysy-wellsy.

04:05.060 --> 04:06.812
Choose a frock.

04:06.900 --> 04:07.969
Ooh!

04:09.300 --> 04:10.574
D'you want a lift in the limo?

04:10.660 --> 04:12.093
I'll get the bus.

04:21.180 --> 04:24.217
"Why don't we have a bash?" Trying
to give the game away, spunk-bubble?

04:24.300 --> 04:26.336
No, I was throwing her off t'scent.
It's classic tactics.

04:26.420 --> 04:29.537
Never, ever attempt
to act on initiative.

04:29.620 --> 04:32.771
When every fucker shouts "Surprise!"
I want her heart to stop.

04:32.860 --> 04:34.896
I want her skin
in a pile on the floor

04:34.980 --> 04:37.335
and a Mimi-shaped hole
in the ceiling.

04:37.420 --> 04:40.457
Great woe will descend upon anybody
who blows this.

04:40.540 --> 04:42.531
Comprendo? Dicko?

04:43.940 --> 04:46.659
Gonna hang this up
in your bedroom after the party?

04:46.740 --> 04:48.219
Oi. My mum.

04:48.300 --> 04:50.370
(Karen) I'm beginning to think
I should've said no.

04:50.460 --> 04:53.133
It's easy. As long as we don't run
out of beer, they'll be happy.

04:53.220 --> 04:56.371
It's not what your dad thinks.
He's been sweating on this for months.

04:56.460 --> 04:57.609
Months.

04:57.700 --> 04:59.179
He's got people coming from all over.

04:59.260 --> 05:00.773
Australia!

05:00.860 --> 05:02.179
We've had loads of dos.

05:02.260 --> 05:04.012
Not while my application
is being looked at.

05:04.100 --> 05:05.852
Brewery can chuck us out any time now.

05:05.940 --> 05:07.419
All-night punch-up
is the last thing I need.

05:07.500 --> 05:09.650
What's this?

05:09.740 --> 05:11.856
This Is Your Life - entertainment.

05:11.940 --> 05:14.693
Slideshows, karaoke,
glitter balls, ceilidh music.

05:14.780 --> 05:17.977
All Mimi's faves.
There's so much I need to do!

05:18.060 --> 05:19.732
Relax.

05:19.820 --> 05:23.051
I'm holding you personally
responsible for everything.

05:23.140 --> 05:24.971
There's stuff I need to get.

05:25.060 --> 05:29.099
A pint and a bucket of ice
for my great big bollocks.

05:32.260 --> 05:33.932
Two weeks for an appointment?

05:34.020 --> 05:35.931
Yeah, wouldn't let me wait.

05:36.020 --> 05:37.851
Doctor is very busy.

05:37.940 --> 05:39.259
So I shopped.

05:39.340 --> 05:43.333
You've had these lame-brained visions
before. You weren't stuffed up then.

05:43.420 --> 05:45.331
Yeah, but not like this.

05:45.420 --> 05:47.854
So, you're not even sure?

05:50.420 --> 05:52.411
Shouldn't you be at school?

05:52.500 --> 05:55.458
The thought of you and my dad
doing it has made me ill.

05:55.540 --> 05:56.689
You should take a test, Mon.

05:56.780 --> 06:01.092
This little bub is gonna make up
for any mistakes I've made.

06:01.180 --> 06:02.135
One for me.

06:02.220 --> 06:04.575
Oh, thanks. What if it's phantom?

06:04.660 --> 06:07.333
Oh, go on, then, I'll take a test.

06:07.420 --> 06:09.376
Lend us one of yours.

06:09.460 --> 06:10.654
I haven't got any.

06:10.740 --> 06:12.571
What kind of teenager are you?

06:12.660 --> 06:15.458
I'll go next door. Mimi's got loads.

06:18.980 --> 06:22.052
Infertile Frank the Fecund.

06:22.140 --> 06:23.778
Dead-eyed Dick Gallagher.

06:23.860 --> 06:26.090
That's me. Hey, Bunty! No waste.

06:26.180 --> 06:29.536
I'm like those cowboys
in a white hat.

06:29.620 --> 06:33.010
Cowboys in black hats
come crashing through the windows,

06:33.100 --> 06:35.739
spray lead all over
the fucking shop.

06:35.820 --> 06:37.299
Miss every bastard.

06:37.380 --> 06:39.291
I kick the saloon door open.

06:39.380 --> 06:42.099
Hello, boys!

06:42.180 --> 06:44.569
You have a little nod round.

06:44.660 --> 06:45.888
Bide me time...

06:48.580 --> 06:51.492
WESTERN MUSIC

06:51.580 --> 06:52.535
Draw!

06:52.620 --> 06:55.293
GUNSHOT

06:55.380 --> 06:58.417
Dusted over.
Or up the duff in this case.

06:58.500 --> 06:59.819
How long's mum been back?

06:59.900 --> 07:01.856
Oh, forever.

07:01.940 --> 07:04.295
Not that spunky, then, are you, Dead-eye?

07:04.380 --> 07:07.372
She'd be onto a second litter by now.

07:07.460 --> 07:10.133
Just stick it on the slate...

07:10.220 --> 07:11.653
Spotty herbert!

07:17.300 --> 07:18.619
A pig.

07:19.620 --> 07:21.576
Spit roast for me mum's rave.

07:21.660 --> 07:23.093
Not in the footballer sense.

07:23.180 --> 07:24.295
Do we leave it there?

07:24.380 --> 07:26.132
How the fuck should I know?

07:26.220 --> 07:28.211
I'll make some room in the cellar.

07:28.300 --> 07:31.497
- Gotta take a date to me mam's party.
- I'm working.

07:32.580 --> 07:35.048
A girl! Smartarse!

07:35.140 --> 07:38.610
If we don't find one,
we've gotta take Nana Murphy.

07:38.700 --> 07:40.418
Kisses for Nana.

07:43.860 --> 07:45.339
Just drag along some fag-hag.

07:45.420 --> 07:46.773
Or Norma.

07:46.860 --> 07:48.418
No. I'm gonna do it for real.

07:48.500 --> 07:49.455
Get a cure.

07:49.540 --> 07:50.529
For what?

07:52.100 --> 07:53.215
Gay.

07:54.260 --> 07:57.536
Found one on the internet.
Fucking insane American Christians,

07:57.620 --> 07:59.895
but they know a thing or two
about not wanking over blokes.

07:59.980 --> 08:00.935
What do you do?

08:01.020 --> 08:04.012
You train your mind to stop thinking
about sex and cocks and that.

08:04.100 --> 08:05.931
Yeah, it's mind over...

08:06.780 --> 08:09.169
<i>Can you feel this?</i>

08:09.260 --> 08:10.932
<i>Do you want this?</i>

08:11.020 --> 08:13.898
- Even that doesn't bother me.
- Tit.

08:13.980 --> 08:15.732
I'll take the arse.

08:21.820 --> 08:23.173
Is it cold enough in here?

08:23.260 --> 08:25.649
It'll have to be. Freezer's full.

08:36.539 --> 08:38.895
Bollocks.

08:38.980 --> 08:40.936
Oi!

08:43.100 --> 08:44.738
- Oi, we're locked in! Help!
- What you doing? No!

08:44.820 --> 08:46.299
(Jamie) Come on! Let us out.

08:46.380 --> 08:47.813
CHEERING

08:47.900 --> 08:49.936
- Shit!
- Quick!

08:50.020 --> 08:51.169
Don't hog it.

08:51.260 --> 08:53.057
They'll drink it all.
Hurry up.

09:19.420 --> 09:22.492
You're Schtan.
Told you I was clever.

09:23.900 --> 09:24.855
Good.

09:24.940 --> 09:26.532
We both lied the same amount.

09:28.980 --> 09:31.175
You have no hair
and you are overweight.

09:31.260 --> 09:34.855
I am short and sent the
best photograph ever taken.

09:36.420 --> 09:40.095
Dobra pozhalovat v angly.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.135
Thank you.

09:41.220 --> 09:43.495
But that's Russian, I'm Ukrainian.

09:43.580 --> 09:44.535
Hello, Irana.

09:44.620 --> 09:45.894
Hello, Schtan.

09:49.780 --> 09:52.613
Dick! Dick! Dick!

09:54.300 --> 09:57.292
They'd've noticed soon enough anyway.

09:58.780 --> 09:59.849
(Jamie) Karen?

10:01.500 --> 10:02.455
Y'all right?

10:18.500 --> 10:20.491
I tried to stop 'em. >

10:22.700 --> 10:24.258
The party stuff.

10:24.340 --> 10:27.616
Mimi's things, the book.
Paddy is gonna explode.

10:27.700 --> 10:29.099
BANG!

10:31.140 --> 10:32.698
I am Spartacus!

10:35.180 --> 10:36.613
Why won't you let us in?

10:36.700 --> 10:39.055
(Monica) I can't have you around
when my knickers are down.

10:40.180 --> 10:42.740
I know what you're like. All done.

10:47.860 --> 10:50.215
It's not...

10:50.300 --> 10:51.255
It's...

10:51.340 --> 10:53.934
What's wrong?

10:54.020 --> 10:56.215
Five, six, piss on sticks.

11:00.740 --> 11:05.609
No line, no baby.
You're not pregnant. Result!

11:06.580 --> 11:08.935
I'm not...

11:09.020 --> 11:10.339
I don't understand...

11:10.420 --> 11:13.093
- Menopause.
- She's too young.

11:13.180 --> 11:15.011
Hormones all over the fucking house.

11:15.100 --> 11:16.579
That's why you're getting your visions.

11:16.660 --> 11:17.615
Oh, no.

11:17.700 --> 11:20.897
Hot flushes, depression,
insomnia, irritability,

11:20.980 --> 11:23.175
night sweats, vaginal dryness.

11:23.260 --> 11:24.454
Please!?

11:24.540 --> 11:28.328
It's part of being a woman.
Comes to us all.

11:28.420 --> 11:32.413
- It's come to her first, mind.
- No more babies.

11:32.500 --> 11:35.333
No more babies for Monica.

11:36.620 --> 11:40.693
I'm not pleased. You said you were
coming back for the ones you left.

11:40.780 --> 11:45.012
- Not to pop another.
- I say a lot of things. They hate me.

11:45.100 --> 11:46.294
Oh, man, they don't.

11:46.380 --> 11:49.258
If I left now, this minute,
take 'em two days to notice.

11:49.340 --> 11:52.491
They'd shrug and then they'd carry on.

11:52.580 --> 11:54.571
Like they expect it.

11:54.660 --> 11:56.696
If they expect anything.

11:56.780 --> 11:57.974
I'm just temporary.

11:59.220 --> 12:03.498
- A visitor, an unwelcome one.
- You're their mam.

12:08.300 --> 12:11.895
I like being full of baby.

12:11.980 --> 12:15.017
And I'm good with them,
too, when they come out.

12:15.100 --> 12:17.568
When they're little and helpless.

12:19.180 --> 12:23.651
And then they grow up
and I fuck it up.

12:23.740 --> 12:25.890
You had to leave.

12:25.980 --> 12:27.174
You were ill.

12:27.260 --> 12:29.535
Yeah.

12:29.620 --> 12:33.249
Hey, there'd have been no
me and you if you hadn't.

12:37.820 --> 12:39.811
I'm never gonna get it right now.

12:39.900 --> 12:41.891
You didn't get it wrong.

12:41.980 --> 12:43.095
You were depressed.

12:43.180 --> 12:44.249
Desperate.

12:44.340 --> 12:48.049
Mmm. And I never thought
I'd feel like that again.

13:05.300 --> 13:06.255
Sorry. Bad news.

13:06.340 --> 13:07.375
What?

13:07.460 --> 13:09.974
We've had a robbery
and can't do your party.

13:10.060 --> 13:11.095
What party?

13:13.460 --> 13:15.610
Would that be a surprise party?

13:15.700 --> 13:17.736
I'm sorry. I didn't know!

13:17.820 --> 13:20.334
No, neither did I, but I do now.

13:20.420 --> 13:22.456
Paddy's gonna rip your lungs out.

13:22.540 --> 13:27.455
You've really crossed
the line this time, shithead!

13:32.140 --> 13:33.812
Fuck!

13:33.900 --> 13:37.176
- Didn't me dad tell you?
- Obviously not.

13:39.540 --> 13:41.610
Sorry. Again.

13:41.700 --> 13:46.979
- It's a good job she already knew, then.
- What?

13:47.060 --> 13:49.210
He chucks one every year.

13:51.220 --> 13:53.290
It's not a surprise if you know.

13:53.380 --> 13:55.689
Paddy doesn't know I know.

13:55.780 --> 13:57.896
That means it's a surprise.

13:57.980 --> 14:01.529
And if my Paddy wants me to
have a party, I'm having one.

14:01.620 --> 14:02.848
Who's ruined t'surprise?

14:02.940 --> 14:05.408
Bet fucking Lynch there.

14:05.500 --> 14:06.728
She already knew.

14:06.820 --> 14:08.094
Hey, it's not the point.
None of us told her.

14:08.180 --> 14:13.174
It's done now. Karen's an idiot,
but she can't help that.

14:13.260 --> 14:14.852
Drop what you're doing.

14:14.940 --> 14:17.408
We know who took it.
Twats that drink in here.

14:17.500 --> 14:20.060
Threaten them. Hurt them.

14:20.140 --> 14:23.894
Bring everything back here.
Not a word to your dad.

14:23.980 --> 14:25.936
Party's on.

14:27.020 --> 14:31.571
Any more dropped turds,
Paddy'll know you told me.

14:33.540 --> 14:36.213
One fucking warning!

14:36.300 --> 14:41.579
Maguires want every piece of
fucking shite from the Jockey back!

14:41.660 --> 14:46.336
Everything! You give it up now
or you fucking die!

14:48.100 --> 14:49.533
Yeah. That should do it.

14:49.620 --> 14:50.769
Oi!

14:56.740 --> 14:58.173
Have you reported it?

14:58.260 --> 14:59.454
Not insured.

14:59.540 --> 15:00.734
We could catch 'em.

15:05.180 --> 15:06.738
Why are we here?

15:06.820 --> 15:08.299
Couple of drinks was the idea.

15:08.380 --> 15:09.574
I'm not British.

15:09.660 --> 15:12.254
I don't need to get drunk to have sex.

15:14.180 --> 15:15.977
What, not even the first time?

15:22.660 --> 15:24.935
< MOANING

15:28.900 --> 15:29.855
Who?

15:29.940 --> 15:33.569
It must be Valerie.
That dumpster from Accounts.

15:33.660 --> 15:35.969
He's always sharing her Cheesy Quavers.

15:37.420 --> 15:40.890
Stan, eh? Dirty fuck-pig.

15:40.980 --> 15:42.936
Pounding away.

15:43.020 --> 15:44.214
Arse cheeks bouncing.

15:45.820 --> 15:47.936
All that... sex.

15:49.540 --> 15:52.452
Get you kind of hot, couldn't it?

15:53.540 --> 15:57.852
Old Stan in there. If he can do it.
What do you say?

16:01.300 --> 16:02.255
I say...

16:03.620 --> 16:04.894
...feel free to crack one off.

16:06.420 --> 16:07.375
Perv.

16:20.740 --> 16:22.935
What you doing?

16:23.020 --> 16:26.251
No more little babas.

16:26.340 --> 16:28.774
Won't be needing these.

16:28.860 --> 16:31.738
Christ's sake, Monica.
You're being a bit...

16:34.060 --> 16:37.018
Kids always desert
their parents in the end.

16:37.100 --> 16:40.058
All of them.

16:40.140 --> 16:41.619
Like you've deserted yours.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.452
I'm two doors away.

16:48.300 --> 16:53.294
Can you take her away?
Reminds me of what I've lost.

16:54.420 --> 16:57.173
Monica, get a grip.

17:10.619 --> 17:12.895
- Oh!
- Oh, sorry!

17:12.980 --> 17:14.015
I'm Tom.

17:14.099 --> 17:17.536
Irana. Good friend... Schtan's.

17:23.500 --> 17:24.569
"Schtan".

17:24.660 --> 17:26.412
It's Eastern Europe.

17:26.500 --> 17:27.728
He's bought her.

17:27.819 --> 17:30.812
Mail-order bride. Gold-digger.

17:30.900 --> 17:32.253
Drugs mule.

17:33.980 --> 17:36.050
Trouble. He needs our help.

17:36.140 --> 17:38.893
- You're jumping to conclusions there.
- Copper's nose.

17:42.220 --> 17:43.778
I think you've met Tom, Irana.

17:43.860 --> 17:46.579
- Irana? Ruskie?
- Ukrainian.

17:46.660 --> 17:49.572
I'll run her through
the computer at work. No offence.

17:49.660 --> 17:53.175
No, you won't. She's a friend.
Someone I trust.

17:53.260 --> 17:57.139
We're a pretty tight group here.
You sure you're up for joining?

17:57.220 --> 17:59.017
Carrie!

18:07.900 --> 18:10.619
Shane, get off. Me dad nicked that.

18:10.700 --> 18:11.769
Bastard!

18:12.820 --> 18:15.015
- What you doing Friday, love?
- What?

18:15.100 --> 18:16.453
Do you want to come to a party wi' me?

18:16.540 --> 18:18.337
Do I fuck!

18:18.420 --> 18:19.455
LAUGHS

18:19.540 --> 18:20.495
DOOR SLAMS

18:23.260 --> 18:26.491
I know where you live!

18:28.020 --> 18:28.975
What the fuck?

18:29.060 --> 18:30.732
Prick!

18:39.100 --> 18:41.898
KNOCK AT DOOR

18:41.980 --> 18:44.414
I was a bit heavy-handed there.

18:44.500 --> 18:45.649
Soz.

18:45.740 --> 18:46.695
Yeah, just a tad. >

18:46.780 --> 18:47.929
I'm very protective of my boys.

18:49.060 --> 18:50.778
< Sorry.

18:50.860 --> 18:52.930
Put the kettle on, Stanley.

18:53.020 --> 18:55.818
I'll show Irana where
to put the shampoo.

18:59.660 --> 19:02.220
Full name? Quickly.

19:02.300 --> 19:06.259
- Irana Illyanovich Karushka Sawicka.
- I'll need a copy of your passport.

19:07.140 --> 19:10.371
- So why didn't you say anything?
- Didn't want to jinx it. We get on.

19:10.460 --> 19:13.213
I think this is something...

19:13.300 --> 19:15.655
I can't say. She's lovely.

19:15.740 --> 19:16.889
Yeah, I heard.

19:16.980 --> 19:20.450
There's more to it than...
It's not just sex. This is real.

19:20.540 --> 19:22.212
Schtan has paid for my flight.

19:22.300 --> 19:24.052
Nothing else. I'm here for month.

19:24.140 --> 19:26.529
Until visa runs out, then home.

19:26.620 --> 19:28.258
Or sooner.

19:28.340 --> 19:31.412
Neither of us has made any promises.
I'm no threat to you.

19:31.500 --> 19:33.377
I know you're not.

19:33.460 --> 19:35.098
"Sooner" sounds good to me.

19:36.220 --> 19:40.611
Consider yourself under surveillance,
and say nothing to Stan.

19:44.340 --> 19:45.568
You'll be out of a job?

19:45.660 --> 19:48.128
If we don't get all the crap back, yeah.

19:49.220 --> 19:52.530
Where's this from? Fuck's sake!

19:54.460 --> 19:56.371
- Fucking hell!
- Argh!

19:57.540 --> 20:00.179
Mon... give us some advice
on a recipe, will you?

20:09.180 --> 20:12.217
Well, I guess it's not my souffle recipe
you're after.

20:12.300 --> 20:14.768
Time for me to snap out of it, is it?

20:14.860 --> 20:17.090
They don't need to see you wallowing.

20:17.180 --> 20:19.296
I know your kids.

20:19.380 --> 20:21.655
They're a good bunch.

20:23.260 --> 20:24.215
Despite you.

20:25.860 --> 20:31.617
Don't think of the one you're not having.
Think of the ones you've got.

20:31.700 --> 20:33.258
I'm sorry.

20:41.940 --> 20:43.453
I suppose you agree with her.

20:43.540 --> 20:45.451
You can't let yourself sink away again.

20:45.540 --> 20:49.249
- I've got you through this before.
- Mmm.

20:49.340 --> 20:50.819
Me escape.

20:52.420 --> 20:55.696
You know I was just using you,

20:55.780 --> 20:57.532
don't you?

20:57.620 --> 20:58.848
No real feeling.

21:01.940 --> 21:03.692
I know you're trying to hurt us.

21:07.580 --> 21:09.013
Congratulations.

21:10.100 --> 21:12.819
You're on your own... again.

21:14.940 --> 21:15.895
DOOR SLAMS

21:21.260 --> 21:24.172
- You only met her five minutes.
- You get a feel for people in my job.

21:24.260 --> 21:26.569
I can tell what she's like.

21:26.660 --> 21:28.571
I've said things to her
I've never said to anyone else.

21:28.660 --> 21:31.379
It's mad, but I really do feel like
I've known her forever.

21:31.460 --> 21:34.770
- Sounds like you've fallen for her big time.
- I'm dreading her leaving already.

21:34.860 --> 21:36.930
Ah, well, there's not a moment to lose.

21:37.020 --> 21:40.535
If you think you've found
something special, then go for it.

21:40.620 --> 21:42.531
- You think?
- Yeah. Go on.

21:42.620 --> 21:45.293
Off you go. Go find her, go tell her.

21:45.380 --> 21:46.574
Erm, 'ey?

21:46.660 --> 21:49.254
Oh, keep the change.

21:49.340 --> 21:51.979
Thank fuck for that.

21:53.660 --> 21:55.457
You've no need to do that.

21:55.540 --> 21:57.576
It's disgusting. I had to.

21:57.660 --> 21:59.651
Thanks.

21:59.740 --> 22:00.934
I... I got you...

22:01.020 --> 22:02.135
- For me?
- Yeah.

22:02.220 --> 22:03.653
Thank you, Schtan.

22:03.740 --> 22:05.856
- Oh.
- Are you all right?

22:05.940 --> 22:08.579
I have allergy to chocolate.

22:08.660 --> 22:09.615
Oh! Oh, sorry.

22:09.700 --> 22:11.418
It's OK.

22:11.500 --> 22:12.899
There's so much I don't know about you.

22:12.980 --> 22:14.299
It's a little thing.

22:14.380 --> 22:18.089
Not to me. I want to know everything.
Been waiting for you me whole life.

22:18.180 --> 22:23.618
Without realising, obviously.
You're the perfect fit, what I need.

22:23.700 --> 22:25.133
I found you.

22:25.220 --> 22:27.415
Come on, let me talk to you.

22:27.500 --> 22:29.297
Schtan...

22:29.380 --> 22:31.814
I know...

22:31.900 --> 22:33.299
I know this is a bit quick,

22:33.380 --> 22:35.769
but I can't stand the thought of you going back.

22:35.860 --> 22:37.259
I don't want us to be apart.

22:37.340 --> 22:38.614
Neither do I.

22:43.740 --> 22:45.935
I think you should move in.

22:46.020 --> 22:49.057
Here. With me. Together.

22:52.140 --> 22:54.256
I don't know how to say...

22:54.340 --> 22:56.649
No need for an answer now.
But think about it.

22:56.740 --> 23:02.178
Schtan, yes, I will think about it.

23:11.180 --> 23:13.375
SIRENS WAIL

23:14.700 --> 23:17.737
< We're shut! Can't you fucking read?

23:21.220 --> 23:24.769
Don't fuck it up!

23:26.660 --> 23:29.299
I know you're family, Karen,
but nothing matters as much to me

23:29.380 --> 23:32.019
as my wife.

23:34.340 --> 23:35.614
Who did it?

23:37.380 --> 23:38.415
Everyone.

23:39.380 --> 23:41.291
It was my fault.

23:41.380 --> 23:43.894
Don't cover for her.
That's pathetic.

23:43.980 --> 23:45.732
You two, get it all back.

23:45.820 --> 23:47.538
We've already started.

23:47.620 --> 23:49.099
We acted on us initiative.

23:49.180 --> 23:51.489
Oh, yeah?

23:51.580 --> 23:54.048
Well, why didn't you tell me first?

23:54.140 --> 23:56.370
Karen said not to.

24:10.140 --> 24:12.859
I haven't always done me best.

24:14.500 --> 24:18.015
There's no point saying that I'll change
or make it up to you, because

24:18.100 --> 24:19.818
that can't happen.

24:22.980 --> 24:27.849
I was wrong. I am a bad mother.

24:29.580 --> 24:33.892
But... I do really love you.

24:35.500 --> 24:38.617
And you love me.
Well, you did when you were babies.

24:38.700 --> 24:42.898
Even you, Liam.
It's you I've let down the most.

24:42.980 --> 24:44.936
I wish I could go back, but...

24:47.260 --> 24:49.899
...all I can do

24:49.980 --> 24:54.690
is learn to love you all better.

25:06.060 --> 25:07.209
What's this?

25:07.300 --> 25:08.653
English.

25:08.740 --> 25:10.492
You don't want to do that now.
Go on up to bed.

25:10.580 --> 25:11.615
It's due tomorrow.

25:11.700 --> 25:14.453
I'll do it for ya.

25:20.020 --> 25:22.739
See you at ten. Thank you!

25:27.620 --> 25:29.178
Is this a brothel?

25:29.260 --> 25:32.172
Course not. We provide
exclusive executive services.

25:32.260 --> 25:33.739
Like what?

25:33.820 --> 25:35.731
Hand shandies, blow jobs, sex.

25:38.060 --> 25:39.209
Why d'you have that?

25:39.300 --> 25:43.578
I thought it'd make a nice visitor's
book, but nobody bothers to sign it.

25:43.660 --> 25:44.934
Not with their real names, anyway.

25:47.340 --> 25:48.898
Couldn't get the other end of this,
could you, mate?

25:50.700 --> 25:52.736
Lillian's Intimate Massage.

25:52.820 --> 25:55.459
SNORES

26:19.300 --> 26:21.894
- They'll think I'm a learning diffie.
- Mum is <i>so</i> challenged.

26:21.980 --> 26:23.413
We know why her lips move
when she's reading now.

26:23.500 --> 26:25.411
(Liam) What am I gonna do?

26:25.500 --> 26:26.728
You can't show that.

26:29.020 --> 26:30.772
Dog ate it.

26:30.860 --> 26:32.293
Morning!

26:36.140 --> 26:37.937
I've made you packed lunches.

26:41.540 --> 26:43.929
Thought I'd save a job for you all. Just...

26:44.020 --> 26:46.739
sandwiches, crisps sort of thing.

26:47.860 --> 26:49.657
What's the matter?

26:49.740 --> 26:55.098
- We get free dinners.
- Yeah, well, this is extra. Playtime.

26:55.180 --> 26:57.535
I've left school. I work in the Jockey.

26:57.620 --> 26:59.929
If it's still open.

27:00.020 --> 27:02.932
Did you find your homework, Liam?
All right, were it?

27:03.020 --> 27:05.853
Yeah. It was, er, great.

27:05.940 --> 27:10.297
- Top of the class, eh, Liam?
- Yeah, yeah. Thanks, Mum.

27:11.540 --> 27:15.215
And get back early,
cos we're having a barbecue!

27:16.300 --> 27:18.768
PLAYS ROUSING CALL

27:30.180 --> 27:33.616
- How do you know it's her?
- Of course it is.

27:33.700 --> 27:36.134
We can't tell him. We can't.

27:38.540 --> 27:40.212
I suppose not.

27:42.100 --> 27:43.931
She's gone.

27:44.020 --> 27:46.295
Yeah. Kitty's gone, too.

27:46.380 --> 27:47.415
Oh.

27:59.780 --> 28:03.455
Why d'you have to do that?
You know he's fallen head over for her.

28:03.540 --> 28:05.053
Yeah. Sad.

28:13.660 --> 28:15.651
Paddy's dropped your CD off.

28:15.740 --> 28:17.696
S'great. Ceilidh.

28:17.780 --> 28:20.135
Ceilidh? Diddly-dee?

28:20.220 --> 28:21.972
I want ballroom dancing.

28:22.060 --> 28:25.655
I've been dropping hints about
Bruce fucking Forsyth for months.

28:25.740 --> 28:27.617
Lose the hippy shit.

28:27.700 --> 28:29.133
I want the posh stuff.

28:32.060 --> 28:33.015
What's that?

28:34.140 --> 28:35.732
Give us it.

28:40.780 --> 28:42.213
Fucking bastards!

28:44.140 --> 28:45.812
We're closed!

28:45.900 --> 28:47.333
Yeah.

28:47.420 --> 28:48.614
I noticed.

28:48.700 --> 28:49.928
What's it to you, anyway?

28:50.020 --> 28:51.499
Tom Tyldesley.

28:51.580 --> 28:54.140
From the brewery.

28:54.220 --> 28:55.539
Heard you'd got a problem.

29:02.780 --> 29:04.691
How's it going for dates, then?

29:04.780 --> 29:06.691
And who's taking Nana?

29:09.100 --> 29:10.328
Piss off.

29:10.420 --> 29:12.092
How about you, Mickey?

29:12.180 --> 29:13.408
I'm fixed up.

29:13.500 --> 29:15.536
Are you? Fuck!

29:15.620 --> 29:18.418
Me? Again? Fuck!

29:20.060 --> 29:23.609
How's the unquenchable thirst
for hot cock?

29:23.700 --> 29:25.895
- It's a girl.
- A girl?

29:27.020 --> 29:29.056
I'd warn her before you put it in. Ooh!

29:29.140 --> 29:30.539
Come on, Shane!

29:30.620 --> 29:32.133
There's beer mats in here.

29:37.580 --> 29:39.935
At least we've still got a chance.

29:41.180 --> 29:42.408
Not now, Frank.

29:45.940 --> 29:49.535
The fine people of Chatsworth
have appointed me spokesman

29:49.620 --> 29:51.531
on their behalf.

29:51.620 --> 29:56.819
People don't like the way
that you're running the Jockey.

29:56.900 --> 29:58.538
It's not just a pub,

29:58.620 --> 30:00.815
a place of ale.

30:01.940 --> 30:04.773
It's a second home to most of us.

30:04.860 --> 30:06.054
First for some.

30:07.180 --> 30:10.217
We need that beer flowing.

30:10.300 --> 30:13.531
Well, you can communicate
to the fuckwits of Chatsworth

30:13.620 --> 30:17.499
that unless this public house
is full of furniture

30:17.580 --> 30:21.971
and running smoothly by tonight,
they're fucking closing me fucking down!

30:22.060 --> 30:24.016
You're shitting me.

30:29.860 --> 30:32.852
I could, um, light the barbie.

30:32.940 --> 30:35.329
Aww, thanks, love!

30:40.420 --> 30:42.217
Oh, there you are.

30:42.300 --> 30:46.134
Now, I know it's meat, but would
you mind taking it out for us?

30:50.980 --> 30:52.811
What's that?

30:52.900 --> 30:54.333
We're not speaking.

30:55.860 --> 30:56.895
Why not?

31:00.220 --> 31:01.733
No real feeling.

31:01.820 --> 31:05.495
I mean, saying it, like, like,
like we was nothing.

31:06.900 --> 31:09.209
- Don't you want the truth?
- Not if it's that.

31:09.900 --> 31:11.379
SHRIEKS

31:11.460 --> 31:12.688
999! Liam's on fire!

31:12.780 --> 31:14.213
(Liam) Mum!

31:16.420 --> 31:18.888
God, another minute...

31:18.980 --> 31:20.618
Who gave him the lighter?

31:26.660 --> 31:27.695
Are y'all right?

31:27.780 --> 31:28.849
Yeah. Have I still got eyebrows?

31:28.940 --> 31:30.134
Just. Your hair's a bit...

31:30.220 --> 31:31.448
(Debbie) What were you doing?!

31:31.540 --> 31:34.008
Well, I thought he was old enough.

31:34.100 --> 31:36.455
It's a responsibility.

31:38.340 --> 31:41.537
He's going through a phase.
Fire, danger...

31:41.620 --> 31:45.772
I do know, Debbie. He is my son.
There are other ways of dealing with it.

31:47.540 --> 31:49.098
Ooh, come on, get t'gas on.

31:49.180 --> 31:52.297
We'll do meat in t'oven, 'ey?

31:52.380 --> 31:53.733
Flame on, Bro.

31:53.820 --> 31:56.254
I'll do it.

32:09.300 --> 32:13.578
- It's all there. Sorry.
- Where have you been?

32:13.660 --> 32:16.379
I ran away.

32:16.460 --> 32:17.734
Was going home.

32:17.820 --> 32:19.458
I didn't want to scare you
about moving in an' that.

32:19.540 --> 32:22.577
No, you didn't. I'm liar.

32:25.140 --> 32:26.573
I lie.

32:27.660 --> 32:28.729
I'm married.

32:28.820 --> 32:31.698
I didn't mean to lie.

32:31.780 --> 32:33.259
My husband...

32:33.340 --> 32:36.173
Is complicated.

32:36.260 --> 32:40.697
I would divorce, but my parents
would become homeless.

32:40.780 --> 32:41.974
I'm trapped.

32:42.060 --> 32:43.334
But you came back.

32:44.580 --> 32:46.457
I couldn't leave.

32:46.540 --> 32:50.818
You're my real man.
I had to tell you the truth and hear

32:50.900 --> 32:53.050
you say you didn't want me.

32:54.500 --> 32:56.456
Say it, Schtan.

33:03.220 --> 33:04.653
What's all this?

33:04.740 --> 33:06.776
Irana's done me the honour
of agreeing to move in.

33:08.340 --> 33:09.409
Wow!

33:10.660 --> 33:11.888
Well done, mate.

33:11.980 --> 33:15.336
When was this? Before or after
she returned the kitty?

33:15.420 --> 33:17.217
Well, after. Don't be like that.

33:17.300 --> 33:21.259
No, I'm really pleased for you both.
Really, I am.

33:21.340 --> 33:24.696
Well, Irana's got to go home to,
er, organise her affairs.

33:24.780 --> 33:26.259
But no hurry. You won't have to
move out for a couple of weeks.

33:26.340 --> 33:28.058
- What?
- What?

33:28.140 --> 33:32.338
It's not gonna work with you two here
as well. No, the flat's in my name.

33:37.380 --> 33:39.496
Come on, that's got to be worth
a free beverage.

33:39.580 --> 33:41.616
You nicked it in the first place.

33:41.700 --> 33:47.058
- I'll buy you one, Frank.
- You're a gentleman, whoever you are.

33:47.140 --> 33:49.131
Very impressive.

33:49.220 --> 33:50.892
- Thank you.
- A shithole once more.

33:50.980 --> 33:53.130
Back to normal and running smoothly.
Like you said.

33:53.220 --> 33:55.211
Gonna give him a chaser with that?

33:55.300 --> 33:56.733
Oh!

33:56.820 --> 33:58.492
I put an order in.

33:58.580 --> 34:01.299
Well, not fast enough.

34:01.380 --> 34:03.416
Close, but no sodding cigar.

34:03.500 --> 34:04.979
You're shut Monday.

34:05.060 --> 34:06.937
MOANS

34:07.020 --> 34:10.695
Looks like you've got a foot in
as the new landlord, Gareth.

34:20.540 --> 34:23.737
I'm impressed.
Didn't think you had it in yer.

34:23.820 --> 34:27.654
We haven't. They're closing us down.

34:27.739 --> 34:30.129
Twat from the brewery
stitched us right up.

34:30.219 --> 34:32.609
- When?
- Out Monday.

34:32.699 --> 34:35.817
If you're looking for a positive spin,
at least we can still have the party.

34:35.900 --> 34:37.731
What?

34:37.820 --> 34:39.650
Well, why not?
Take your mind off things.

34:39.739 --> 34:42.208
I can't believe you.

34:42.300 --> 34:45.212
We're homeless
and all you care about is a poxy party!

34:45.300 --> 34:46.891
You can stop at ours.

34:46.980 --> 34:50.255
Can't persuade Mandy back,
but you've always got a home with me.

34:50.340 --> 34:52.534
You're fucking joking. Live with you?

34:52.620 --> 34:55.896
You're a selfish old hag. We're
trying to make a go of summat here,

34:55.980 --> 34:58.096
and all you care about is yourself.

34:58.180 --> 35:01.172
Well, fuck you.
I won't be at your party.

35:01.260 --> 35:03.330
I'll be packing!

35:03.420 --> 35:05.331
What have I said now?!

35:05.420 --> 35:07.809
We've been here before, Mum.

35:09.220 --> 35:10.289
I agree with her.

35:19.340 --> 35:22.173
Been thinking about other things
we could do together.

35:22.260 --> 35:25.058
Trips and that.

35:25.140 --> 35:26.937
Could, er, could go to Blackpool.

35:27.940 --> 35:30.010
YELLING

35:30.940 --> 35:32.293
Or the Lakes.

35:32.380 --> 35:34.211
SPLASH, FOGHORN

35:35.060 --> 35:36.288
The zoo?

35:36.380 --> 35:38.814
(Liam) Cool!

35:42.940 --> 35:44.896
Tea's ready when you are.

35:47.140 --> 35:50.177
Doesn't bear thinking about.
I preferred it when she was shit.

35:50.260 --> 35:52.296
- Yeah.
- (Debbie) We should just tell her.

35:52.380 --> 35:53.369
"We don't like you.

35:53.460 --> 35:56.099
"Stop trying to be a proper mum,
cos you can't be."

35:56.180 --> 35:59.889
She left us,
and you're just rubbish.

35:59.980 --> 36:03.575
Oh! Oh! Oh! Aren't you bored
of being so hard on her?

36:05.540 --> 36:08.293
Try being nice for a change.

36:15.580 --> 36:17.298
Come in.

36:17.380 --> 36:18.859
Can't yet.

36:18.940 --> 36:20.532
Something to do.

36:34.380 --> 36:35.415
What's this?

36:35.500 --> 36:36.489
Happy Mother's Day.

36:36.580 --> 36:38.093
(Debbie) For all the ones we missed.

36:38.180 --> 36:40.091
Let's start again, eh?

36:41.860 --> 36:42.815
Thanks.

36:42.900 --> 36:47.337
And you don't have to try too hard,
you know.

36:49.940 --> 36:52.295
We're just glad you're here.

36:52.380 --> 36:53.733
Home. Like a family again.

36:55.460 --> 36:59.089
We... are so pleased.

37:04.940 --> 37:08.012
You're all, erm,

37:08.100 --> 37:09.419
sending me a message.

37:10.540 --> 37:12.292
I'll back off.

37:12.380 --> 37:13.529
I get it.

37:24.700 --> 37:27.612
It won't take long. Then I'll be free.

37:27.700 --> 37:30.419
I know. I'll miss you, that's all.

37:30.500 --> 37:32.013
You're worried I won't come back.

37:32.100 --> 37:35.410
God, no. I hadn't thought about that.

37:39.220 --> 37:42.610
My mother gave me this before she die.

37:42.700 --> 37:44.850
And she say I should wear forever

37:44.940 --> 37:49.331
so she could watch over
most precious thing.

37:51.700 --> 37:53.930
Now I have most precious thing.

38:08.180 --> 38:10.057
No...

38:20.860 --> 38:24.011
- Happy birthday, Mi-mo.
- Oh...

38:24.100 --> 38:26.295
Thanks, turtle.

38:26.380 --> 38:30.851
And here's to 40 more together.

38:30.940 --> 38:32.851
DOOR OPENS

38:32.940 --> 38:34.453
Pressie time.

38:34.540 --> 38:37.054
Shut the door. Piss off!

38:42.420 --> 38:45.492
LAUGHS

38:49.180 --> 38:52.411
Stay here.

38:52.500 --> 38:54.092
No goodbyes.

39:00.660 --> 39:02.491
You're a special guy, Stan.

39:18.940 --> 39:21.249
I've got a mate who'll
lend us a bed for a week.

39:21.340 --> 39:24.013
I am not staying with
anybody whose name is Chopper.

39:25.420 --> 39:27.490
What are you doing?
Oh, you said Monday!

39:28.740 --> 39:32.528
Tom's a bit confused. You've
been doing everything by the book.

39:32.620 --> 39:34.099
He's losing out. Tell her, Tom.

39:34.180 --> 39:35.693
I'll offer you the same deal I gave Jez.

39:35.780 --> 39:37.054
Which is?

39:37.140 --> 39:39.734
Water the beer down,
sell dodgy spirits

39:39.820 --> 39:40.809
and then split the difference.

39:40.900 --> 39:43.334
Don't have to say yes, Karen.

39:44.940 --> 39:48.137
Fuck it. Yeah. I'll do it.

39:48.220 --> 39:51.132
Should've said.
Don't know all the scams.

39:51.220 --> 39:53.609
Nice doing business with you.

39:56.780 --> 39:58.213
Thanks.

39:58.300 --> 40:00.052
Sorry I called you selfish.

40:00.140 --> 40:02.051
And an old hag.

40:04.380 --> 40:05.335
Yeah.

40:06.900 --> 40:09.619
Now get your fucking arse into gear!

40:11.900 --> 40:15.370
Anyway, she can't eat them,
and I'm watching this.

40:15.460 --> 40:16.654
Thanks, Stan!

40:16.740 --> 40:18.298
Your advice led to it. Ta.

40:18.380 --> 40:20.132
Pleasure, love. I'm sure
you'll be very happy together.

40:20.220 --> 40:21.494
Thanks again for these.

40:26.500 --> 40:27.694
Oi!

40:27.780 --> 40:29.657
- Oh, no.
- We'll see you in court.

40:29.740 --> 40:33.130
You should've used precautions.
It's not my fucking fault! Out! Out!

40:34.380 --> 40:36.450
What's up with them?

40:36.540 --> 40:39.008
I've had a faulty batch
of pregnancy testing kits,

40:39.100 --> 40:40.738
all showing up negative.

40:40.820 --> 40:42.697
Them the ones that Meena had?

40:42.780 --> 40:47.456
Meena? What's my Meena doing
with fucking pregnancy testing kits?

40:49.660 --> 40:52.458
Negative.

40:52.540 --> 40:54.417
And stop nicking from the shop.

40:54.500 --> 40:56.775
- Well, what's the point in having one?
- And don't have sex!

41:09.660 --> 41:10.615
Stan?

41:12.740 --> 41:13.934
She put Irana through the computer.

41:14.020 --> 41:15.214
Why? I said not to.

41:15.300 --> 41:17.097
She's a con artist.

41:17.180 --> 41:20.570
Specialises in coppers.
Done five in Greater Manchester.

41:20.660 --> 41:23.891
Something about
paying off an ex-husband.

41:25.020 --> 41:25.975
Sorry.

41:26.060 --> 41:27.618
(Carrie) Taken 'em for thousands.

41:27.700 --> 41:28.928
(Tom) Did you give her any money?

41:29.020 --> 41:29.975
No!

41:30.060 --> 41:32.369
Pay him off. Use this.

41:32.460 --> 41:34.052
Think of it as a moving-in present.

41:34.140 --> 41:36.495
Thank you, Schtan.

41:36.580 --> 41:38.457
Course I didn't!

41:38.540 --> 41:40.451
She's not even Ukrainian.

41:40.540 --> 41:43.532
She's Austrian. Lives in Crawley.

41:43.620 --> 41:47.169
But if you didn't give her anything,
she'll be back. We can trap her.

41:47.260 --> 41:49.410
So, you up for it, "Schtan"?

41:51.820 --> 41:54.653
Why don't you fuck off?

41:58.740 --> 42:00.651
Jesus!

42:00.740 --> 42:03.174
You do a man a favour...

42:03.860 --> 42:05.532
Why don't we have a quick one, huh?

42:05.620 --> 42:07.497
It's ages before the table.

42:07.580 --> 42:09.013
Just one. I'll have to pace meself.

42:09.100 --> 42:10.169
Just the one. Come on.

42:12.780 --> 42:14.372
Shh! Quiet, they're here!

42:16.900 --> 42:18.731
Shh.

42:18.820 --> 42:21.857
CHEERING

42:23.340 --> 42:27.379
Oh, fucking hell! You bastard!

42:27.460 --> 42:30.213
Did you not guess?
I was sure you'd guessed this time.

42:30.300 --> 42:32.734
No! Didn't have a fucking clue.

42:36.460 --> 42:37.415
Party!

42:39.580 --> 42:41.935
MUSIC STARTS

42:51.900 --> 42:55.939
'I understand you wanting to help
the kids get a grasp of the Bible.'

42:56.020 --> 42:57.214
< Anyone watching this?

42:57.300 --> 42:58.255
No, not really.

43:03.580 --> 43:05.013
I <i>am</i> pregnant.

43:06.540 --> 43:08.610
I've taken a new test.

43:11.340 --> 43:16.016
- Do you want it?
- Yeah. I really do.

43:16.100 --> 43:17.897
(Carl) Great!

43:17.980 --> 43:20.414
A baby. Why not?

43:20.500 --> 43:22.695
I'm fed up of being the youngest,
anyway.

43:22.780 --> 43:25.499
And you won't have to
bring it up, I promise.

43:25.580 --> 43:28.777
But I will need
one little bit of help.

43:28.860 --> 43:31.499
Don't let me screw up this time.

43:31.580 --> 43:33.059
I'll try.

43:47.660 --> 43:50.220
Fuck!

43:50.300 --> 43:52.370
- I asked that bint out.
- And I said no.

43:52.460 --> 43:55.770
- What's wrong with me?
- Your taste in women, for a start.

43:55.860 --> 43:58.215
Forget that bitch.
Come on, let's dance.

43:58.300 --> 43:59.369
Er, I hope you don't mind.

43:59.460 --> 44:00.415
What?

44:00.500 --> 44:03.572
Me brother wanted to come along.

44:07.620 --> 44:10.088
Testing, testing, testing.

44:12.540 --> 44:16.499
We all know why we're here tonight,
don't we? Happy birthday!

44:16.580 --> 44:19.219
CHEERING

44:19.300 --> 44:20.494
But...

44:20.580 --> 44:26.018
there's one more little surprise,
because tonight...

44:26.100 --> 44:30.651

44:41.580 --> 44:44.572
Who's written "Terry Titwank"
all over this page?

44:46.540 --> 44:48.770
Who?!

44:49.900 --> 44:54.337
- Paddy, it's all right. Oh, thanks.
- It took me ages to do this!

44:54.420 --> 44:56.695
It's all right. Come on, dance.

45:04.940 --> 45:08.296
I owe you everything.

45:08.380 --> 45:09.733
Me life, really.

45:10.860 --> 45:12.418
That's not nothing.

45:16.340 --> 45:22.575
<i>And my heart's kind of full of joy</i>

45:22.660 --> 45:30.089
<i>Because she told me I'm her kind of boy</i>

45:36.420 --> 45:38.536
I'm gonna have a baby.

45:38.620 --> 45:41.976
You've already fucking told me that.
It's hardly a surprise, is it?

45:54.540 --> 45:58.135
Are you taking a fucking turn here,
or what? Come on.

45:58.220 --> 46:01.212
(Monica) 'By many people's standards,
I do count as a terrible mother.

46:01.300 --> 46:04.895
'I'm never gonna win any prizes, anyway.

46:04.980 --> 46:06.777

children as they like.

46:06.860 --> 46:08.532
'lf you're an old rocker,

46:08.620 --> 46:10.019
you're virtually expected
to leave hundreds of 'em.'

'Nobody forgives a woman.

46:27.780 --> 46:29.771

46:36.100 --> 46:38.170
Mon-Mon's second chance.

47:28.260 --> 47:30.774
Time, gentlemen, please.

47:32.540 --> 47:35.577
Oh, well. In that case,
I'll have another one.

47:35.660 --> 47:38.254
Give us the rest of
the bell back first.

47:38.340 --> 47:40.615
Me? Why is it always me?
