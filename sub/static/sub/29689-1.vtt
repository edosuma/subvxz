00:21.880 --> 00:25.630
(slow, dramatic piano music)

02:09.589 --> 02:12.422
(hard rock music)

02:13.307 --> 02:14.440
(gunshots banging)

02:14.440 --> 02:16.607
(yelling)

02:22.987 --> 02:24.608
- If you kill us all we
can't make the Kaiser

02:24.608 --> 02:26.941
believe they took his money.

02:29.896 --> 02:32.063
(yelling)

02:52.516 --> 02:55.183
(gunshot bangs)

02:57.596 --> 02:59.657
Was it worth it?

02:59.657 --> 03:02.324
(gunshot bangs)

03:19.139 --> 03:20.600
Load up.

03:20.600 --> 03:21.633
Let's do this thing.

03:24.449 --> 03:26.790
- I'm gonna bang 'em,
then I'm gonna kill 'em.

03:26.790 --> 03:28.110
- You ain't banging shit.

03:28.110 --> 03:29.990
- You banging the side of the
road I'll tell you that much.

03:29.990 --> 03:30.933
As we drive by.

03:32.100 --> 03:34.260
- No, one of them ladies
is gonna wander outside,

03:34.260 --> 03:36.060
I'm telling you and then she's gonna get

03:36.060 --> 03:38.731
the full motherfucking Johnson.

03:38.731 --> 03:40.981
(laughing)

03:44.454 --> 03:45.287
- Whoo!

03:45.287 --> 03:47.283
Baby, Berretta where are you?

03:47.283 --> 03:48.222
Ow!

03:48.222 --> 03:49.860
- Ladies, once you're done
with your current party

03:49.860 --> 03:53.433
you need to say goodbye 'cause
we need to have a meeting.

03:53.433 --> 03:54.793
- [Man] Babe, where'd you go.

03:54.793 --> 03:56.252
Ow.
- Okay.

03:56.252 --> 03:58.040
- [Man] Fuck you dirty little kitty.

03:58.040 --> 04:00.540
- I'm sorry, but we're gonna
have to cut this short tonight.

04:00.540 --> 04:02.270
- What! Why?

04:02.270 --> 04:03.103
- Don't worry.

04:03.103 --> 04:04.640
- I didn't do my safe word.

04:04.640 --> 04:07.298
- No, we'll come back to it, okay baby.

04:07.298 --> 04:09.881
(gentle music)

04:17.471 --> 04:20.053
(bell ringing)

04:21.899 --> 04:24.650
(military music)

04:58.240 --> 05:01.073
(hard rock music)

05:53.800 --> 05:56.663
- Kaiser, here's the gentleman
that you requested to see.

06:00.910 --> 06:02.290
Will that be all.

06:02.290 --> 06:03.140
- Yes, thank you.

06:30.943 --> 06:31.776
What's up?

06:31.776 --> 06:34.093
Are you the fellow who lost my money?

06:36.700 --> 06:39.367
Don't answer, I already know the answer.

06:40.610 --> 06:42.360
So what are we gonna do about this?

06:44.120 --> 06:46.320
Do I look like a fool to you?

06:46.320 --> 06:49.710
I really do not take
losing money that well.

06:49.710 --> 06:52.380
- Did I hear you say you lost some money?

06:52.380 --> 06:56.223
Because that is not good
news and makes me unhappy.

06:58.210 --> 06:59.594
- Did you hear her?

06:59.594 --> 07:02.853
When she's unhappy, I'm really unhappy.

07:04.060 --> 07:06.210
- I mean, if you don't get that money back

07:06.210 --> 07:09.613
you are not getting any
of this anytime soon.

07:11.335 --> 07:12.935
- Did you hear her?

07:12.935 --> 07:15.053
I like getting up in that.

07:15.983 --> 07:19.622
If you don't find my money,
I won't be getting any

07:19.622 --> 07:21.230
and that makes me really unhappy.

07:21.230 --> 07:23.320
- This money is important.

07:23.320 --> 07:24.660
If you don't get it back,

07:24.660 --> 07:26.710
I'm gonna have to have my mom come visit.

07:28.370 --> 07:29.320
- Did you hear her?

07:30.295 --> 07:32.010
Not only am I not getting any

07:33.210 --> 07:34.460
but her mom is coming over.

07:34.460 --> 07:37.220
And those are two things
that really piss me off.

07:37.220 --> 07:39.220
- She'll probably bring my drunk cousin.

07:40.910 --> 07:42.240
- Did you hear her?

07:42.240 --> 07:44.730
So not only am I not
getting any, I have to deal

07:44.730 --> 07:48.774
with her mom and that
stupid, drunk cousin of hers.

07:48.774 --> 07:51.363
- (laughing) Actually I'm already here.

07:53.426 --> 07:54.259
Woo hoo.

07:56.780 --> 07:57.613
- Fuck!

07:58.530 --> 08:00.020
Did you hear them?

08:00.020 --> 08:04.030
Not only am I not getting
any, but her mom's coming over

08:04.030 --> 08:07.113
and the drunk cousin is already here.

08:08.440 --> 08:10.883
- Babe, I'm hungry.

08:12.360 --> 08:13.710
- Did you hear her?

08:13.710 --> 08:14.623
Now she's hungry.

08:15.540 --> 08:18.520
So now I have to deal
with you losing my money,

08:18.520 --> 08:21.610
her mom coming over, the
drunk ass cousin who's already

08:21.610 --> 08:25.586
here, not getting any
and now she's hungry.

08:25.586 --> 08:27.203
- What are we doing for dinner?

08:28.400 --> 08:30.930
- Do you know what the
fuck we should do for food?

08:30.930 --> 08:31.780
I don't think so.

08:33.320 --> 08:38.210
- Ugh, just the thought
of losing all that money

08:38.210 --> 08:41.169
makes me feel like my period is coming on.

08:41.169 --> 08:42.423
- Her fucking period.

08:44.316 --> 08:47.020
Even though that kinda makes
not getting any alright,

08:47.020 --> 08:49.750
I still have to deal with
her mom, not getting any,

08:49.750 --> 08:53.250
the drunk cousin, having to
get food 'cause she's hungry

08:54.920 --> 08:55.773
and her period.

08:57.506 --> 08:59.030
- Do you think you could
pick up some tampons

08:59.030 --> 09:00.700
when you go get dinner tonight?

09:00.700 --> 09:01.650
- Did you hear her?

09:03.215 --> 09:05.630
Not only do I have to
pick up food and tampons

09:06.600 --> 09:08.400
but now I have to deal with her mom,

09:09.560 --> 09:14.540
her drunk cousin, her
period, her being hungry

09:14.540 --> 09:17.733
and last but not least,
you losing my money.

09:18.970 --> 09:20.442
I swear if she wasn't my hot stepmother

09:20.442 --> 09:22.463
I wouldn't put up with this shit.

09:26.040 --> 09:27.090
Are you done?

09:27.090 --> 09:28.350
- Yeah, I feel like we've taken up

09:28.350 --> 09:29.900
about the right amount of time.

09:35.930 --> 09:37.520
- Now.

09:37.520 --> 09:39.420
What are we gonna do about this money?

09:42.450 --> 09:44.050
Any day now?

09:44.050 --> 09:46.284
- Am I supposed to answer that?

09:46.284 --> 09:48.550
- Yes, what the fuck are you waiting for?

09:48.550 --> 09:50.630
- Yes, I got a team on it.

09:50.630 --> 09:53.130
They'll be here in the
morning with your money.

09:53.130 --> 09:53.963
- A team.

09:55.040 --> 09:55.873
- Yes sir.

09:57.130 --> 10:00.090
- Tell you what, if I
don't have that money

10:00.090 --> 10:01.690
back in my possession by tomorrow morning.

10:01.690 --> 10:03.695
You're gonna go take
me to go see this team.

10:03.695 --> 10:04.573
Got it.

10:05.410 --> 10:06.243
- Yes sir.

10:17.810 --> 10:19.110
- Get the fuck outta here.

10:20.095 --> 10:21.178
- Cannonball.

10:24.415 --> 10:27.082
(intense music)

10:42.980 --> 10:45.137
- We're about 30 clicks out.

10:45.137 --> 10:46.180
Make sure you get your phones,

10:46.180 --> 10:48.130
things may have to change fast.

10:48.130 --> 10:50.220
Keep your phones and answer
'em, they're burners.

10:50.220 --> 10:51.680
- [Bryan] Got it.

10:51.680 --> 10:53.279
- Everybody clear about
what they're doing?

10:53.279 --> 10:54.748
Any questions?

10:54.748 --> 10:55.770
Can't have any fuck ups.

10:55.770 --> 10:58.110
- I'm the drunk, whoohoo.

10:58.110 --> 10:59.380
Piece of cake.

10:59.380 --> 11:00.670
- Good to go.

11:00.670 --> 11:01.780
- I'm gonna fuck some bitches up.

11:01.780 --> 11:04.133
- Just take care of what
you're supposed to do.

11:04.973 --> 11:06.523
I don't want this to get messy.

11:13.283 --> 11:15.800
(bluegrass music)

11:15.800 --> 11:17.080
- Hey what's goin' on.

11:17.080 --> 11:18.970
- I sent the guests home early tonight.

11:18.970 --> 11:21.260
- Yeah, what is goin' on.

11:21.260 --> 11:24.890
- Well, I booked a private party for us.

11:24.890 --> 11:26.590
- Ooh, private party.

11:26.590 --> 11:28.474
I like private party.

11:28.474 --> 11:30.630
- Well it's not just a
normal private party.

11:30.630 --> 11:32.870
It's a high-roller private party.

11:32.870 --> 11:35.343
- Now that's what I'm talking about.

11:35.343 --> 11:37.800
- Wait, who are they?

11:37.800 --> 11:41.640
- Well they were referred by
a good friend of The Ranch.

11:41.640 --> 11:43.540
- But you know who they are right?

11:43.540 --> 11:45.883
- No, but they do have a lot of money.

11:46.960 --> 11:47.890
- Nebraskans?

11:47.890 --> 11:50.800
- Oh my god, who cares. How
much are we talking about?

11:50.800 --> 11:53.510
- Do you remember that hunting lodge.

11:53.510 --> 11:55.600
- Oh yeah, Four Pump Buck.

11:55.600 --> 11:57.685
Man, we backed us some
trophies on that one.

11:57.685 --> 11:59.350
- Triple that.

11:59.350 --> 12:00.524
- Triple!

12:00.524 --> 12:01.674
That's, that's like 11.

12:02.600 --> 12:05.690
- Did you say triple?

12:05.690 --> 12:07.110
- Yes I did.

12:07.110 --> 12:09.060
- I really like private party.

12:09.060 --> 12:09.893
- Wait a second.

12:09.893 --> 12:11.503
You know what they say right?

12:14.120 --> 12:15.963
- DOn't look gift horse in ass.

12:18.860 --> 12:19.693
- No.

12:19.693 --> 12:21.503
If it sounds too good to be true.

12:22.550 --> 12:25.183
- Well, how many of them are there?

12:25.183 --> 12:26.620
- Four of them.

12:26.620 --> 12:30.230
- But there are seven of us.

12:30.230 --> 12:32.850
- There is plenty of pieces to go around.

12:32.850 --> 12:33.790
- Bullshit.

12:33.790 --> 12:36.840
If I'm doing this, I want all the money.

12:36.840 --> 12:37.850
- Fuck off Kitty!

12:37.850 --> 12:40.320
If Monique says we split, then we split.

12:40.320 --> 12:42.550
We're all in this together.

12:42.550 --> 12:44.980
- But what if they just want me?

12:44.980 --> 12:48.750
- There's plenty of it to go around.

12:48.750 --> 12:50.430
- Must be a lot of money.

12:50.430 --> 12:53.130
- In fact, there is eight girls.

12:53.130 --> 12:54.290
- [All] What!

12:54.290 --> 12:55.507
- They made a special request.

12:55.507 --> 12:56.730
- No, no, no.

12:56.730 --> 12:58.890
I do not work with some
skank I do not know.

12:58.890 --> 13:02.125
- Well, first of all, I am
the skank that you know.

13:02.125 --> 13:04.350
Bette's coming out of retirement.

13:04.350 --> 13:05.580
- Are you serious?

13:05.580 --> 13:08.290
- Trust me, it was a lot
of money to agree to.

13:08.290 --> 13:09.590
- Oh wow!

13:09.590 --> 13:12.060
We must be talking some serious cash.

13:12.060 --> 13:14.460
- Well, are you gonna split yours then?

13:14.460 --> 13:15.293
- Yes!

13:16.260 --> 13:17.620
- Yes, but what?

13:17.620 --> 13:21.103
- After this, we can take a
month off and go to Oklahoma.

13:21.103 --> 13:22.445
- All right awesome.

13:22.445 --> 13:25.525
(girls cheering)

13:25.525 --> 13:27.170
- Now hold on girls.

13:27.170 --> 13:30.740
They might be in to some weird
shit and I know they paid,

13:30.740 --> 13:34.290
but you make the rules.

13:34.290 --> 13:36.820
- Like, how weird are we talking.

13:36.820 --> 13:38.453
Weirder than titty bingo?

13:38.453 --> 13:39.630
(laughing)

13:39.630 --> 13:41.183
- Alabama hot pocket?

13:41.183 --> 13:42.240
- Doppelbanger.

13:42.240 --> 13:43.923
- I know, you've seen it all.

13:44.885 --> 13:46.230
- What about Sasquatch and twirlies.

13:46.230 --> 13:47.480
- Flying camel.

13:47.480 --> 13:49.091
- I know, you've seen a lot.

13:49.091 --> 13:50.643
- What about truffle butt.

13:52.060 --> 13:55.210
- Oh my god, are you done yet?

13:55.210 --> 13:57.217
- Oh, let's do old school.

13:57.217 --> 13:58.050
(laughing)

13:58.050 --> 13:59.480
- Rusty nail.

13:59.480 --> 14:00.360
- Steamers.

14:00.360 --> 14:02.470
- Space stalking.

14:02.470 --> 14:03.830
- Clown party.

14:03.830 --> 14:05.170
- No, I don't do clowns.

14:05.170 --> 14:06.080
Clowns scare me.

14:06.080 --> 14:08.633
But, I do love anal.

14:10.598 --> 14:11.720
- Shut the fuck up.

14:11.720 --> 14:13.350
Do you really want to extend this?

14:13.350 --> 14:14.840
I get it.

14:14.840 --> 14:16.403
Are you in?

14:17.988 --> 14:18.940
- Alright I'm in.

14:18.940 --> 14:19.900
- I'm in.

14:19.900 --> 14:21.980
- You say then I'm in.

14:21.980 --> 14:23.630
- Are you good Kitty?

14:23.630 --> 14:25.680
- Yeah, I'm good up until space stalking.

14:27.410 --> 14:29.000
- Well now.

14:29.000 --> 14:29.833
So.

14:31.110 --> 14:32.463
If you're chosen.

14:33.600 --> 14:35.400
Then you know what to do.

14:35.400 --> 14:38.420
But if you're not chosen, then make sure

14:38.420 --> 14:41.320
you help us until we
get back to our rooms.

14:41.320 --> 14:42.853
Now you've done this before.

14:43.740 --> 14:46.250
We have Thumper here to protect us

14:46.250 --> 14:48.170
and you have your training.

14:48.170 --> 14:51.684
You have been training
for countless minutes.

14:51.684 --> 14:56.050
And trust me, you can handle anything.

14:56.050 --> 14:58.870
Now we do not know these gentlemen.

14:58.870 --> 15:01.890
So, if you're not chosen, please take

15:01.890 --> 15:05.573
the necessary precautions
and then you can go.

15:06.640 --> 15:11.640
Now, have fun, because after this

15:11.990 --> 15:14.943
we're gonna go all the way to Oklahoma.

15:15.884 --> 15:18.634
(girls cheering)

15:20.313 --> 15:25.023
Now get ready to fall in at 01900 hours.

15:28.865 --> 15:31.698
(hard rock music)

16:09.827 --> 16:11.577
- Alright, you ready?

17:10.522 --> 17:13.106
(gentle music)

17:26.563 --> 17:29.507
- (sighing) Maybe tonight's the night.

17:29.507 --> 17:32.020
- The night when you meet the one?

17:32.020 --> 17:32.853
- Maybe.

17:34.180 --> 17:35.300
- I think you need to rethink

17:35.300 --> 17:37.200
where you're trying to meet Mr. Right.

17:38.240 --> 17:39.860
- You know I might even make enough money

17:39.860 --> 17:42.760
to be able to get home and
help my momma pay off the farm.

17:43.770 --> 17:45.630
And then there's my brother.

17:45.630 --> 17:48.640
- Oh wait, he's the one that
needs the testicle right?

17:48.640 --> 17:50.033
- And I'm the only match.

17:50.930 --> 17:53.070
- You have such a big heart Trix.

17:53.070 --> 17:55.543
- Or I could just try out my new move.

17:56.860 --> 17:57.693
Ball-cuzzi.

17:58.572 --> 17:59.460
- What?

17:59.460 --> 18:02.167
- Oh yeah, you take a glass of warm water

18:02.167 --> 18:06.303
and you put a guy's balls
in it and you blow bubbles.

18:08.247 --> 18:09.640
- My god!

18:09.640 --> 18:11.210
That's ridiculous.

18:11.210 --> 18:12.133
- Hell it works.

18:15.828 --> 18:18.661
(hard rock music)

18:38.120 --> 18:40.263
- Ladies, the party has arrived.

19:03.060 --> 19:04.850
- Well welcome gentlemen

19:04.850 --> 19:07.450
to the Dreams Come True Ranch.

19:07.450 --> 19:08.950
- Well howdy ma'am, thank you.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.830
- Well we're happy to have you here.

19:11.830 --> 19:13.910
Now we just need to go
over a few ground rules

19:13.910 --> 19:15.940
before we get started.

19:15.940 --> 19:18.470
First of all, no weapons.

19:18.470 --> 19:21.713
So Thumper here's just gonna pat you down.

19:24.040 --> 19:26.870
Now make sure you take
everything out of your pockets,

19:26.870 --> 19:31.870
socks, groin and ass if
that's what you're into.

19:31.900 --> 19:33.823
- No weapons in there, trust me.

19:35.010 --> 19:38.620
- Alright, now I need you to
hand over all your phones.

19:38.620 --> 19:40.370
- We weren't told that.

19:40.370 --> 19:43.040
- Oh, it's just so you don't take pictures

19:43.040 --> 19:46.330
or video recording of the girls.

19:46.330 --> 19:48.993
And that's for your safety and ours too.

19:49.920 --> 19:51.900
- But I like taking pictures.

19:51.900 --> 19:54.800
- Do you know how easy those
things are to hack into?

19:54.800 --> 19:56.980
- [Jamie] Guys, just give 'em up.

19:56.980 --> 19:57.860
- Well if there's a problem,

19:57.860 --> 20:00.350
we can shut this party down, right now.

20:00.350 --> 20:02.107
- No it's not a problem.

20:02.107 --> 20:04.420
It's just that it's
Brian's bachelor party.

20:04.420 --> 20:07.700
Think he just wanted some
fond memories to look back on

20:07.700 --> 20:09.000
when he's bored out off his mind

20:09.000 --> 20:11.400
now that he's bought the farm and all.

20:11.400 --> 20:13.870
- Well then, we're just
gonna put 'em behind the bar

20:13.870 --> 20:15.380
and then afterwards you can get 'em back

20:15.380 --> 20:16.940
at the end of the night.

20:16.940 --> 20:18.800
Now, the other rules.

20:18.800 --> 20:19.850
- Goddammit.

20:19.850 --> 20:21.203
How many rules are there?

20:22.220 --> 20:23.180
- There are no rules.

20:23.180 --> 20:25.120
Just have fun.

20:25.120 --> 20:27.190
But we gotta set limits between you

20:27.190 --> 20:29.150
and your girl and that's it.

20:29.150 --> 20:30.003
- Limits?

20:31.350 --> 20:33.830
- My girls love high-rollers like you.

20:33.830 --> 20:36.820
If you just let 'em know, I'm
sure they're gonna teach you

20:36.820 --> 20:39.343
a trick or two before
you leave here sugar.

20:40.290 --> 20:41.130
- That sounds good.

20:41.130 --> 20:42.280
- So is that the money?

20:43.310 --> 20:44.863
- Yeah, sure is.

20:46.280 --> 20:49.640
You know, I'm all for
paying in cash and all

20:49.640 --> 20:51.950
but I gotta tell ya, ridin'
around in the boonies

20:51.950 --> 20:54.230
in an unmarked truck isn't
exactly the way I like to roll

20:54.230 --> 20:55.443
with this kind of cash.

20:57.880 --> 20:58.713
It's all there.

21:00.100 --> 21:01.950
- Yeah, I'm sure it is.

21:01.950 --> 21:02.783
Thumper.

21:04.860 --> 21:06.330
'Cause if it's not,

21:06.330 --> 21:10.940
my ladies are known to hunt a bitch down.

21:10.940 --> 21:14.050
- I'm sure they have.

21:14.050 --> 21:16.830
- And hunt with a vengeance.

21:16.830 --> 21:19.943
- Fortunately, it doesn't
have to come to that, alright.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.297
It's all in there, we're just looking

21:22.297 --> 21:24.290
to have a good time, that's it.

21:24.290 --> 21:27.253
- That's a mighty big bag
for that amount of money.

21:28.900 --> 21:29.870
Let me guess?

21:29.870 --> 21:32.171
You guys brought magnums.

21:32.171 --> 21:33.650
- How did you know?

21:33.650 --> 21:38.043
- Oh honey, I deal in
fantasy land all day long.

21:39.400 --> 21:41.880
- Can we get the fuckin' party started.

21:41.880 --> 21:44.707
- Alright gentlemen,
let's meet the ladies.

21:48.957 --> 21:51.790
(hard rock music)

22:57.181 --> 22:59.348
(yelling)

23:04.981 --> 23:05.814
Ladies.

23:22.842 --> 23:25.100
Introduce yourselves.

23:25.100 --> 23:26.760
- Hi, I'm Loni.

23:29.877 --> 23:31.760
- Loni, Loni, Loni, mmh!

23:34.130 --> 23:34.963
- I'm Emily.

23:35.960 --> 23:38.003
- Nope, she looks like she can read.

23:39.540 --> 23:40.683
- Hi, I'm Trix.

23:42.300 --> 23:44.253
- Ooh, Trix is for Bry-Bry.

23:48.860 --> 23:50.113
- Kitty, rrrrrrr.

23:56.280 --> 23:57.670
- I'm Vice.

23:57.670 --> 23:58.503
- You five-O.

23:59.540 --> 24:01.530
- They call me Vice because
that's what it feels like

24:01.530 --> 24:03.893
when your dick's in my pussy.

24:03.893 --> 24:04.726
- What!

24:07.030 --> 24:08.080
- I've heard of that.

24:10.100 --> 24:11.627
- Hi, I'm Berretta.

24:11.627 --> 24:13.650
- And I'm Angel.

24:13.650 --> 24:15.017
Pleasure to meet you.

24:16.920 --> 24:18.367
- And I'm Thumper.

24:18.367 --> 24:20.933
- Thumper, get the fuck out of the line.

24:22.522 --> 24:23.393
- [Thumper] You never know.

24:24.960 --> 24:26.360
- Okay gentlemen.

24:26.360 --> 24:27.413
Choose a lady.

24:28.950 --> 24:30.540
- Paul, you go last.

24:30.540 --> 24:31.600
- [Paul] Why?

24:31.600 --> 24:33.550
- 'Cause you don't need that much time.

24:37.560 --> 24:38.623
- Bryan, you're up.

24:40.964 --> 24:42.923
- Trix, you look like fun.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.620
- Can I get two at once?

24:48.620 --> 24:51.870
- Leave me out of that
party, I don't share.

24:51.870 --> 24:53.920
- Fine, I want the two at the end anyway.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.433
- Okay Paul who'll it be?

25:05.223 --> 25:07.090
- Think you can handle all of me.

25:07.090 --> 25:09.330
- Honey, I can take you blindfolded

25:09.330 --> 25:11.800
with my hands behind my back.

25:11.800 --> 25:13.350
- We'll have to see about that.

25:14.756 --> 25:15.589
- Let's do this.

25:25.087 --> 25:26.693
- And you know who I'm taking.

25:27.690 --> 25:30.290
I just want to see if the
reputation still holds up.

25:31.200 --> 25:32.180
- Well don't worry.

25:32.180 --> 25:34.643
No young buck has ever been disappointed.

25:35.860 --> 25:38.693
A man died, but ah, that's another story.

25:39.630 --> 25:42.720
Loni, go make the drinks.

25:42.720 --> 25:45.800
Emily take care of the phones.

25:45.800 --> 25:48.690
Vice, go make the rounds, then you can go.

25:48.690 --> 25:49.523
- Yes ma'am.

25:51.130 --> 25:53.660
You don't know what
you're missing darling.

25:53.660 --> 25:55.790
- You're right about that.

25:55.790 --> 25:56.690
Next time.

25:56.690 --> 25:57.620
- Next time.

25:58.785 --> 26:03.785
(party rock music)
(Bryan yelling)

27:12.808 --> 27:14.225
- This is so fun.

27:25.596 --> 27:28.346
(girls cheering)

27:47.099 --> 27:49.349
(grunting)

27:55.173 --> 27:56.384
- Fuckin' bitch.

27:56.384 --> 27:59.051
(both grunting)

27:59.932 --> 28:01.182
- Fuckin' dick.

28:08.968 --> 28:11.635
(both grunting)

28:15.561 --> 28:16.811
- Motherfucker.

28:18.640 --> 28:21.557
(party rock music)

28:41.270 --> 28:42.600
- Vice!

28:42.600 --> 28:44.093
Oh come on baby!

28:45.062 --> 28:46.240
Damn!

28:46.240 --> 28:47.073
Vice!

28:49.214 --> 28:50.894
Hold on tough guy.

28:50.894 --> 28:53.142
(yelling)

28:53.142 --> 28:55.094
You motherfucker!

28:55.094 --> 28:56.782
You motherfucker!

28:56.782 --> 28:58.365
You killed my girl!

29:00.403 --> 29:01.653
Son of a bitch.

29:02.822 --> 29:05.489
(both grunting)

29:07.622 --> 29:08.789
Come on bitch!

29:17.984 --> 29:20.817
(Thumper yelling)

29:32.260 --> 29:36.093
(Thumper laughing maniacally)

29:50.979 --> 29:51.950
- So?

29:51.950 --> 29:53.950
- I had such a good time tonight.

29:53.950 --> 29:56.943
- Yeah, well it's only
gonna get better later.

29:58.030 --> 29:58.863
- Your reputation--

29:58.863 --> 30:02.823
- The phones are behind the bar and safe.

30:03.820 --> 30:04.700
- Thank you.

30:04.700 --> 30:06.450
- Anything else?

30:06.450 --> 30:08.960
- No, you and Loni can go.

30:08.960 --> 30:12.740
Have Thumper walk you out and let him know

30:12.740 --> 30:14.530
that we're all in our rooms.

30:14.530 --> 30:15.630
I'll see you tomorrow.

30:18.070 --> 30:18.970
Now where were we.

30:23.056 --> 30:24.970
- Here, drink this.

30:24.970 --> 30:25.990
- A water.

30:25.990 --> 30:27.210
- Yeah.

30:27.210 --> 30:29.880
There's something I like
to do special after sex.

30:29.880 --> 30:31.730
- Now what's that honey?

30:31.730 --> 30:33.798
- I really like to get a
golden shower when I'm done.

30:33.798 --> 30:35.920
- (laughs) You want me to do what?

30:35.920 --> 30:37.220
- Yeah, is that a problem?

30:38.470 --> 30:39.423
- As long as it's not happening to me.

30:39.423 --> 30:41.930
I don't give a flying fuck.

30:41.930 --> 30:44.830
Hell, for a few extra bucks
I'll even drop a deuce on you.

30:45.768 --> 30:46.696
- Great!

30:46.696 --> 30:48.900
I don't think my wife's
gonna do this for me.

30:48.900 --> 30:49.733
- Okay then.

30:52.870 --> 30:54.913
Let me get a little bit
more comfortable for you.

31:05.726 --> 31:07.730
(giggling)

31:07.730 --> 31:10.606
- Here, you're gonna need a lot of water.

31:10.606 --> 31:11.439
- Okay.

31:16.310 --> 31:18.170
- It'll be over quick.

31:18.170 --> 31:20.523
- Oh what.

31:24.705 --> 31:25.872
- Don't worry.

31:27.286 --> 31:30.119
I'm not gonna hurt you, that much.

31:40.187 --> 31:43.403
Your hearing, it's the last thing to go.

31:44.380 --> 31:47.230
You're gonna be able to hear
us tearing this place apart.

31:48.220 --> 31:50.270
- So I wanna take you up on your offer.

31:50.270 --> 31:51.890
- [Kitty] What's that baby?

31:51.890 --> 31:54.043
- I wanna blindfold you and tie you up.

31:55.550 --> 31:57.360
You said you can handle that.

31:57.360 --> 31:59.820
- Oh I can handle a lot of things.

31:59.820 --> 32:02.287
Doesn't mean I'll do all of them.

32:02.287 --> 32:05.780
- Not gonna do anything more
than heighten your senses.

32:05.780 --> 32:08.920
- Well, if you get out of
line, Thumper'll get ya.

32:08.920 --> 32:11.083
Plus, I'm really good at knots.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.513
- What's your safe word.

32:17.995 --> 32:18.828
- Money.

32:21.328 --> 32:23.280
- I like that.

32:23.280 --> 32:24.630
Bend over.

32:24.630 --> 32:25.630
- Ooh daddy.

32:31.320 --> 32:32.153
Oh!

32:33.200 --> 32:34.420
- You like that?

32:34.420 --> 32:35.980
- Can I do it to you now.

32:36.987 --> 32:39.248
- You're gonna love this.

32:39.248 --> 32:42.248
(muffled screaming)

32:49.033 --> 32:51.463
- Did you say money?

32:53.388 --> 32:55.250
(girls giggling)

32:55.250 --> 32:57.083
- So what do you want baby?

32:57.083 --> 33:00.817
- I want you both to blow me.

33:00.817 --> 33:01.650
- Ooh.

33:13.065 --> 33:17.205
(Kevin yelling)
(heads cracking)

33:17.205 --> 33:20.205
(suspenseful music)

33:23.220 --> 33:24.470
- How about a dance baby?

33:25.456 --> 33:26.289
- Okay.

33:42.786 --> 33:43.953
What the fuck!

33:44.927 --> 33:47.906
(piano clangs)

33:47.906 --> 33:49.230
- I know right.

33:49.230 --> 33:50.063
Dart gun.

33:52.087 --> 33:52.920
Oh fuck!

33:58.393 --> 34:01.093
(Monique grunting)

34:01.093 --> 34:02.313
It's only money.

34:03.163 --> 34:04.490
It's not worth it.

34:04.490 --> 34:05.323
- Fuck you.

34:06.259 --> 34:09.092
(Monique gasping)

34:17.460 --> 34:18.293
- Boss.

34:19.150 --> 34:20.810
Where are you?

34:20.810 --> 34:21.909
- [Jamie] I'm in here.

34:29.239 --> 34:30.830
- Keep the case.

34:30.830 --> 34:32.293
- This is the Kaiser's case.

34:33.400 --> 34:35.230
He's gonna think that they set him up

34:35.230 --> 34:36.130
or we're in on it.

34:37.480 --> 34:40.679
Either way, they're gonna
be fighting each other

34:40.679 --> 34:42.270
until we get the fuck out of town.

34:42.270 --> 34:43.748
Here take this.

34:43.748 --> 34:45.248
Throw that bitch on the couch.

34:50.420 --> 34:53.420
(suspenseful music)

35:43.552 --> 35:44.951
(guns banging)

35:44.951 --> 35:46.201
- [Jamie] Fuck!

35:50.000 --> 35:53.343
- [Kevin] Hey, don't get
any blood on the money.

35:53.343 --> 35:54.893
- [Bryan] Shut the fuck up man.

35:56.510 --> 35:57.890
- [Kevin] Fuckin' dumbass.

35:57.890 --> 36:00.860
Going around killing people
just to get his kicks.

36:00.860 --> 36:02.120
- [Bryan] Shut the fuck up.

36:02.120 --> 36:02.953
- [Kevin] Fuck him.

36:02.953 --> 36:05.350
I hope he dies and I get his cut.

36:05.350 --> 36:08.300
- The white lights, I see the white light.

36:08.300 --> 36:11.140
Fuck, even if dead I'm gonna see white.

36:11.140 --> 36:12.813
This is some bullshit.

36:16.130 --> 36:18.707
- [Kevin] Fuck him, he ain't gettin' shit.

36:18.707 --> 36:20.160
- [Bryan] You ain't gettin' shit.

36:20.160 --> 36:23.500
I'm gonna beat your ass before
you get a dime of this money.

36:23.500 --> 36:25.993
- [Kevin] Go fuck yourself.

36:26.999 --> 36:28.079
(girls gasping)

36:28.079 --> 36:30.746
- Oh mein gott.

36:30.746 --> 36:33.620
- Monique, hang in there.

36:33.620 --> 36:34.870
We're gonna get you help.

36:36.469 --> 36:37.838
- I'm sorry.

36:37.838 --> 36:38.901
- Sorry?

36:38.901 --> 36:40.300
- I'm sorry for bringing them here.

36:40.300 --> 36:42.568
They took everything.

36:42.568 --> 36:45.068
- What do you mean everything!

36:47.981 --> 36:51.861
- I pulled everything we
had and put it in the safe.

36:51.861 --> 36:53.111
- You did what.

36:53.970 --> 36:55.220
- For Oklahoma.

36:56.711 --> 36:58.741
- Oh, this is not okay.

36:58.741 --> 36:59.824
- Everything?

37:01.041 --> 37:02.760
- Oh, it was all set.

37:02.760 --> 37:05.570
We only had a couple more days.

37:05.570 --> 37:06.797
- They took it all?

37:08.430 --> 37:11.360
- Seriously, what are
you not getting here?

37:11.360 --> 37:14.060
- Shouldn't we be gettin'
a sheriff or an ambulance?

37:14.060 --> 37:15.280
- No, leave me.

37:15.280 --> 37:17.220
- No, you're gonna make it.

37:17.220 --> 37:18.933
- You girls know what to do.

37:20.771 --> 37:22.920
Go get our money, get those bastards

37:24.333 --> 37:26.393
and do what I taught you.

37:29.023 --> 37:30.440
With a vengeance!

37:32.551 --> 37:34.081
(screaming)

37:34.081 --> 37:34.914
- No!

37:38.740 --> 37:39.573
- What now?

37:41.151 --> 37:42.680
- I don't know about you guys,

37:42.680 --> 37:43.980
but I'm posting this shit.

37:47.402 --> 37:48.235
Cheese.

37:54.183 --> 37:57.230
- You heard her, let's go get
those fuckers and our money

37:57.230 --> 37:58.883
and I mean all of it.

37:59.795 --> 38:01.513
- Where the fuck is Thumper.

38:03.590 --> 38:05.570
- I mean, they must have killed him?

38:05.570 --> 38:06.963
- What about Vice.

38:09.630 --> 38:12.363
- Hopefully, she got away.

38:13.733 --> 38:15.890
- Well let's go get her?
- Well how do we find them?

38:15.890 --> 38:18.490
- Well if everyone did their
job it wouldn't be hard.

38:18.490 --> 38:19.323
- Oh.

38:24.030 --> 38:25.720
Emma put the codes in here.

38:25.720 --> 38:27.880
- Oh I hope this works.

38:27.880 --> 38:29.480
- Oh holy shit.

38:29.480 --> 38:30.340
It works.

38:30.340 --> 38:32.220
- And it says here they're
only seven miles away,

38:32.220 --> 38:33.550
on the road.

38:33.550 --> 38:35.333
- Wait, why are there five blips?

38:36.270 --> 38:38.300
- Oh shoot, one of those is Vice's phone.

38:38.300 --> 38:40.083
- We're going to get them right.

38:40.083 --> 38:41.420
- You're damn straight.

38:41.420 --> 38:43.290
- Wait, they're not moving.

38:43.290 --> 38:45.590
They're just sitting in
the middle of nowhere.

38:48.510 --> 38:49.970
- Let's go ladies.

38:49.970 --> 38:52.693
Get your stuff and be
back in five minutes.

38:59.770 --> 39:01.570
- What the fuck happened back there?

39:02.800 --> 39:04.672
- I don't fuckin' know.

39:04.672 --> 39:05.620
- What do you mean you don't know.

39:05.620 --> 39:07.420
How'd that bitch wake up so quickly?

39:08.670 --> 39:11.443
- All I do know is I gave
that bitch a lot of sedative.

39:12.330 --> 39:13.920
- What does it matter.

39:13.920 --> 39:16.720
I have five bags of money right here.

39:16.720 --> 39:18.343
We made a killing on this.

39:18.343 --> 39:21.653
- Dude shut the fuck up,
I'm about to beat your ass.

39:23.090 --> 39:25.720
- [Kevin] What is your fuckin' problem.

39:25.720 --> 39:27.490
- I'm tired of listening to you man.

39:27.490 --> 39:30.170
We have a guy fuckin' dying back there.

39:30.170 --> 39:32.080
- Guys, he's getting cold.

39:32.080 --> 39:33.680
So we better do something quick.

39:35.100 --> 39:37.263
- I have the money split.

39:38.259 --> 39:41.450
- Fuck the money man, we need
to get the fuck out of here.

39:41.450 --> 39:46.130
- You can fuck your money,
but I'm taking what's mine.

39:46.130 --> 39:50.280
And whoever else's that
doesn't (blows) fucking care.

39:50.280 --> 39:51.260
- That's it man.

39:51.260 --> 39:52.443
You ain't gettin' shit.

39:54.859 --> 39:57.026
(yelling)

39:58.068 --> 40:00.735
(both grunting)

40:27.848 --> 40:30.515
(gunshot bangs)

40:32.980 --> 40:36.080
- Paul, get out here and
help me break this shit up.

40:36.080 --> 40:36.913
- [Paul] Coming.

40:47.219 --> 40:50.136
(gunshots banging)

40:59.730 --> 41:01.083
- Alright here's the deal.

41:02.220 --> 41:04.940
We're gonna hand out the
shares and we're splitting up.

41:04.940 --> 41:05.903
We go on foot.

41:10.860 --> 41:11.693
Fuck!

41:11.693 --> 41:12.930
Here hold this.

41:13.907 --> 41:15.707
- What about Johnson?

41:15.707 --> 41:17.410
- [Jamie] We'll take care
of that in the morning.

41:17.410 --> 41:18.810
- Don't worry about Johnson.

41:20.960 --> 41:21.793
He's dead.

41:29.997 --> 41:33.164
(dramatic rock music)

41:50.633 --> 41:52.883
(laughing)

42:13.970 --> 42:14.970
- You talking to me.

42:16.525 --> 42:18.175
Well I'm the only one here right.

42:20.377 --> 42:22.627
(laughing)

43:43.123 --> 43:44.913
- Now, where the hell did we park?

43:46.995 --> 43:49.195
- Come on guys, let's
go kill these fuckers.

43:49.195 --> 43:50.945
- Whoo hoo!
- Whooooo.

43:56.137 --> 43:59.304
(dramatic rock music)

44:06.348 --> 44:09.265
(gunshots banging)

44:17.366 --> 44:18.605
(yelling)
(intense rock music)

44:18.605 --> 44:20.855
(grunting)

44:29.594 --> 44:32.494
(yelling)

44:32.494 --> 44:34.744
(grunting)

45:11.910 --> 45:15.487
- K-A-I fuck you!

45:16.960 --> 45:18.090
- Kaiser, Kaiser.

45:19.610 --> 45:21.520
Kaiser, where is it?

45:21.520 --> 45:22.473
- Safe won't open.

45:24.306 --> 45:26.806
- Did you use the combination.

45:32.305 --> 45:36.813
No, no, it's left at 22.

45:37.928 --> 45:38.761
22.

45:50.237 --> 45:52.487
(grunting)

46:22.281 --> 46:24.448
(choking)

46:51.092 --> 46:54.009
(gunshots banging)

47:09.762 --> 47:10.595
Kaiser?

47:11.760 --> 47:12.743
- It was empty.

47:14.414 --> 47:17.310
- What?

47:17.310 --> 47:20.684
- There were some women
here earlier weren't there?

47:20.684 --> 47:24.033
- Um, hookers?

47:24.033 --> 47:25.283
- What hookers.

47:26.820 --> 47:29.570
(dramatic music)

48:05.909 --> 48:08.800
- Alright, we are getting close.

48:08.800 --> 48:12.160
Got the guys moving, but Vice
is still in the same place.

48:12.160 --> 48:14.440
- So they're not together.

48:14.440 --> 48:16.670
- Well they're going in
the same general direction,

48:16.670 --> 48:19.320
just not together.

48:19.320 --> 48:21.090
- Well that should make it easier

48:21.090 --> 48:23.053
to get these mother fuckers.

48:24.332 --> 48:25.510
- You know what, Vice is
still in the same place

48:25.510 --> 48:27.270
so we got to go get her.

48:27.270 --> 48:29.000
- Wait, it could be a trap.

48:29.000 --> 48:30.610
- Pull up at this corner.

48:30.610 --> 48:34.100
You and I will approach and
Trix and Angel will cover us.

48:34.100 --> 48:35.883
- [Berretta] Got it.

48:35.883 --> 48:37.033
- (knocking) 200 yards.

48:51.477 --> 48:53.830
- Who the fuck is this?

48:53.830 --> 48:56.520
- [Kitty] I have never seen him before.

48:56.520 --> 48:58.810
- [Berretta] Must be the
one who did the dirty work.

48:58.810 --> 49:01.010
- [Kitty] Looks like
Monique got him though.

49:01.010 --> 49:03.180
She looks like she went down with a fight.

49:03.180 --> 49:04.660
- I found her.

49:04.660 --> 49:05.760
- [Kitty] Where?

49:05.760 --> 49:07.780
- She's here under the tarp.

49:07.780 --> 49:08.800
She's dead.

49:08.800 --> 49:10.050
- Did you guys find her.

49:10.050 --> 49:11.400
- Oh yes, honey.

49:11.400 --> 49:12.840
She's no longer with us.

49:12.840 --> 49:14.563
- She's dead.

49:16.080 --> 49:18.470
Those mother fuckers are gonna get it

49:18.470 --> 49:19.800
and they're gonna get it bad.

49:19.800 --> 49:20.850
- These guys don't know the suffering

49:20.850 --> 49:22.260
they're about to fucking endure.

49:22.260 --> 49:25.712
- I swear I'm gonna
crucify a mother fucker.

49:25.712 --> 49:28.379
(intense music)

49:41.433 --> 49:44.100
(gunshot bangs)

49:45.010 --> 49:45.843
- Oh fuck!

49:50.431 --> 49:51.960
- You know how we do this.

49:51.960 --> 49:52.923
- Damn right.

50:22.293 --> 50:24.960
(gunshot bangs)

50:31.075 --> 50:33.742
(gunshot bangs)

50:59.827 --> 51:01.580
- Hey baby.

51:01.580 --> 51:02.413
Remember us.

51:05.130 --> 51:07.593
- You do know you're in
a world of shit right?

51:11.530 --> 51:16.530
So let's see how you take it,
blindfolded and tied up now.

51:17.020 --> 51:18.900
Angel blindfold him.

51:18.900 --> 51:19.733
- Coming.

51:21.140 --> 51:22.863
- Wow, you're cute.

51:24.170 --> 51:25.920
- Wait a second, hold on.

51:25.920 --> 51:28.005
Let's see what he's got to say.

51:28.005 --> 51:29.730
- I don't know anything.

51:29.730 --> 51:32.100
- Who are you and who sent you!

51:33.027 --> 51:35.027
- I don't know anything.

51:37.540 --> 51:39.190
It's just some guy, I don't know.

51:41.090 --> 51:45.213
- Come on baby, tell me what you know

51:45.213 --> 51:47.713
and I will give it all to you.

51:48.741 --> 51:49.730
- Fuck.

51:49.730 --> 51:52.380
I don't know anything, I
was just hired to do a job.

51:52.380 --> 51:53.550
- Oh wow.

51:53.550 --> 51:55.220
He's getting excited.

51:55.220 --> 51:57.363
I must be better than I thought.

51:57.363 --> 51:59.590
(girls laughing)

51:59.590 --> 52:00.423
- Come on.

52:01.650 --> 52:02.583
His name is Jamie.

52:03.610 --> 52:05.410
He hired me.

52:05.410 --> 52:06.800
I can help you find him.

52:06.800 --> 52:10.120
- Tell us where he is
and where our money is.

52:11.131 --> 52:13.141
And I will give it all to you.

52:13.141 --> 52:14.023
- Oooh.

52:14.023 --> 52:16.540
- This guy doesn't know shit.

52:16.540 --> 52:17.470
- Yeah, I agree.

52:17.470 --> 52:19.083
- Well how do we know for sure.

52:24.344 --> 52:25.177
- Oh yeah.

52:26.940 --> 52:27.773
- Lucky boy.

52:29.620 --> 52:30.453
Here we go.

52:35.850 --> 52:37.600
- Come on, be harder!

52:40.930 --> 52:43.347
- [Beretta] Ride him cowgirl.

52:49.219 --> 52:52.136
(gunshots banging)

53:10.819 --> 53:11.830
- Well.

53:11.830 --> 53:14.121
One down.
- I'm going to go get our bow.

53:14.121 --> 53:14.954
- [Trix] Thanks babe.

53:14.954 --> 53:18.730
- And maybe the money is there. (laughs)

53:18.730 --> 53:21.460
- Told you I'd crucify a motherfucker.

53:21.460 --> 53:22.750
- And that you did.

53:22.750 --> 53:24.210
And in good whore fashion.

53:24.210 --> 53:26.900
- I've always wanted to
see someone fuck to death.

53:26.900 --> 53:29.300
I'm surprised though,
that little Trixie did it.

53:30.299 --> 53:31.676
- What can I say.

53:31.676 --> 53:34.020
(mumbles)

53:34.020 --> 53:36.450
- Hey guys, I got a beat on the next one.

53:36.450 --> 53:39.600
He's in an open field
about a half mile up.

53:39.600 --> 53:42.316
- Here's your bow and
here is some of the money,

53:42.316 --> 53:44.000
not all of it.

53:44.000 --> 53:45.640
- It's okay, don't worry about it.

53:45.640 --> 53:48.760
That just means that each one
of them has a little bit of it

53:48.760 --> 53:51.080
and we're not gonna
stop until I get it all.

53:51.080 --> 53:52.163
- What the fuck!

53:53.007 --> 53:53.840
- Sorry.

53:53.840 --> 53:55.230
I mean until we get it all.

53:55.230 --> 53:57.430
I know it's all of us or none of us

53:57.430 --> 54:00.847
'cause we are doing it for
Monique and the girls right.

54:00.847 --> 54:01.980
- When we're finished with this, we should

54:01.980 --> 54:04.230
give some of that money to
the other girl's families.

54:04.230 --> 54:05.750
- That is so nice.

54:05.750 --> 54:06.583
- Guys!

54:06.583 --> 54:07.416
We can discuss this later.

54:07.416 --> 54:08.677
We have to stay focused here.

54:08.677 --> 54:10.290
The guys in an open field.

54:10.290 --> 54:13.390
I say we just go in there,
surround the mother fucker.

54:13.390 --> 54:15.900
He pulls a gun, we just lay him out.

54:15.900 --> 54:18.760
- No, we capture for info.

54:18.760 --> 54:20.200
- Yeah I think that's a better idea.

54:20.200 --> 54:22.230
- No, these guys are fuckin' dickheads

54:22.230 --> 54:23.763
and plus they're getting away.

54:24.920 --> 54:25.993
- Let's go get him.

54:30.827 --> 54:34.244
(intense dramatic music)

55:17.210 --> 55:19.113
- Oh he is a fucking dead man.

55:24.293 --> 55:25.126
Oh fuck.

55:29.323 --> 55:30.156
Come on!

55:30.156 --> 55:30.989
Come on!

55:33.992 --> 55:34.825
Come on!

55:36.373 --> 55:37.620
Come on!

55:37.620 --> 55:39.020
Come on!

55:39.020 --> 55:39.853
Come on!

55:42.350 --> 55:43.640
- Remember us.

55:43.640 --> 55:44.840
- Sure do.

55:44.840 --> 55:46.990
You two bitches were
about to give me head.

55:46.990 --> 55:49.131
- Until you knocked us out.

55:49.131 --> 55:51.510
- Aw, sorry about that darlin'.

55:51.510 --> 55:52.343
Little girls like you shouldn't

55:52.343 --> 55:53.950
be wandering around by yourselves.

55:53.950 --> 55:56.920
- Oh don't you worry about us now.

55:56.920 --> 55:59.520
- [Katie] Yup, you should
be the one that's worried.

56:00.400 --> 56:02.010
- Seriously, fuck off!

56:02.010 --> 56:04.300
I took two of you out with one blow.

56:04.300 --> 56:06.540
What makes you think I
can't take all four of you.

56:06.540 --> 56:09.150
- No babe, you don't have a shot.

56:09.150 --> 56:10.980
- Yeah, you better be armed

56:10.980 --> 56:12.872
'cause I'm about to fuck you up.

56:12.872 --> 56:15.100
- (laughing) Oh we don't need a gun

56:15.100 --> 56:16.700
to take a little pussy like you.

56:18.431 --> 56:20.303
- What'd you say?

56:20.303 --> 56:24.093
- Are you ready 'cause I'm
about to fist-fuck your face.

56:24.093 --> 56:26.843
(Kevin grunting)

56:38.511 --> 56:41.643
- You know what, I really
like your hair color.

56:41.643 --> 56:43.060
- Oh thanks babe.

56:48.832 --> 56:51.749
- Guys I think we need to help her.

57:06.853 --> 57:09.520
(Kevin yelling)

57:50.427 --> 57:53.094
(Angel yelling)

58:41.055 --> 58:42.866
- No man hits me.

58:42.866 --> 58:45.533
(gunshot bangs)

58:53.407 --> 58:55.803
- Two down, two to go.

58:57.860 --> 58:59.190
- Load up.

58:59.190 --> 59:00.990
The next one's about two miles away.

59:11.600 --> 59:14.030
So, this shows that the guy's right

59:14.030 --> 59:15.580
on the other side of this pond.

59:16.650 --> 59:17.800
- Okay, I have an idea.

59:19.070 --> 59:19.943
- What you got?

59:20.990 --> 59:22.710
- Berretta, you and Angel come with me.

59:22.710 --> 59:24.633
Trix, you come in on the other side.

59:25.956 --> 59:27.830
- Well, and then what?

59:27.830 --> 59:30.870
- Well, we've got to wash all
this blood off us don't we.

59:30.870 --> 59:33.847
- Mmm, I think I got you.

59:33.847 --> 59:34.680
- Got it.

59:35.535 --> 59:37.610
- Trix, you know what to do.

59:39.013 --> 59:41.015
I'll have a towel waiting.

59:41.015 --> 59:43.765
(girls laughing)

01:00:00.266 --> 01:00:01.099
- Jugs.

01:00:01.099 --> 01:00:01.957
- What?
- Jugs.

01:00:01.957 --> 01:00:03.343
- What is she saying.

01:00:05.088 --> 01:00:06.720
- Jugs they're all over me.

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:07.580
- She means bugs.

01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:08.779
You mean bugs.

01:00:08.779 --> 01:00:09.696
- Yes jugs.

01:00:12.027 --> 01:00:13.808
- These are jugs.

01:00:13.808 --> 01:00:16.058
(laughing)

01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:21.350
- [Berretta] God this was a stupid idea.

01:00:21.350 --> 01:00:23.620
This water's disgusting.

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:25.183
- Man these girls are smart.

01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:29.210
- [Angel] Seriously, I hope
he gets over here quickly.

01:00:31.997 --> 01:00:33.690
- Oh I could do this all day.

01:00:33.690 --> 01:00:36.658
- [Kitty] Don't worry, I think
he's a three-stroke Johnnie.

01:00:36.658 --> 01:00:38.373
- Uh, okay I'm done.

01:00:45.390 --> 01:00:48.003
Well, well, well, hello ladies.

01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:50.300
What are you all doing here?

01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:53.440
Again ladies I said, what
are you all doing here?

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:55.750
- Aren't you one of the guys
that fucked our place up?

01:00:55.750 --> 01:00:57.365
- Yes, this is one of those fuckers

01:00:57.365 --> 01:00:59.430
that kill our girlfriends
and take our money.

01:00:59.430 --> 01:01:01.100
- Oh please, don't do anything to us.

01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:02.976
We just came out here to clear our minds.

01:01:02.976 --> 01:01:03.950
- Sure you are.

01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:06.260
And you're doing a damn
good job of it too.

01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:08.970
Get your asses over here and sit down.

01:01:08.970 --> 01:01:10.330
- Oh come on, leave us alone.

01:01:10.330 --> 01:01:12.030
We don't want anything to do with you.

01:01:12.030 --> 01:01:13.940
- What happened to the rest of you?

01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:15.160
- We're the only ones left.

01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:16.658
You killed everyone.

01:01:16.658 --> 01:01:18.437
- I didn't kill nobody.

01:01:18.437 --> 01:01:20.890
But if don't tell me what the
fuck you're doing out here

01:01:20.890 --> 01:01:22.250
I'm gonna start.

01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:24.713
- Can we at least put our clothes on.

01:01:28.327 --> 01:01:29.983
- Yeah, go ahead.

01:01:36.997 --> 01:01:38.663
- Please don't kill us.

01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:42.260
- Then answer my questions.

01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:43.730
What are you doing out here?

01:01:43.730 --> 01:01:45.880
And what happened to
that other girl, Trix?

01:01:48.477 --> 01:01:51.110
- Right here motherfucker.

01:01:51.110 --> 01:01:52.083
Now drop it.

01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:58.920
- Now you've got some
questions you need to answer.

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:00.173
- I ain't answering shit.

01:02:02.050 --> 01:02:03.600
- Who the fuck is Jamie?

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:04.910
Where is he?

01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:07.217
And where is our fucking money?

01:02:07.217 --> 01:02:10.003
- You can ask all you want doll
but I ain't saying nothing.

01:02:11.298 --> 01:02:13.740
(girls laughing)

01:02:13.740 --> 01:02:14.613
- Stand him up.

01:02:15.450 --> 01:02:17.550
Maybe he'd like to talk in a higher pitch.

01:02:19.077 --> 01:02:21.827
(Bryan groaning)

01:02:26.350 --> 01:02:27.183
- You know what?

01:02:27.183 --> 01:02:28.540
I know what'll get him to talk.

01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:31.503
Take his shirt off, I know
what this freak likes.

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:34.313
- What for?

01:02:35.810 --> 01:02:38.910
- Well you know, what did
Monique say that they would do

01:02:38.910 --> 01:02:40.810
to those fuckers in Iraq to get info.

01:02:40.810 --> 01:02:42.370
- Torture him.

01:02:42.370 --> 01:02:44.090
- More exactly.

01:02:44.090 --> 01:02:45.560
- What, like waterboard.

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:46.757
- Exactly.

01:02:46.757 --> 01:02:49.700
(girls laughing)

01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:52.900
Now I know what this fucker wants.

01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:54.153
Get him to the ground.

01:02:56.498 --> 01:02:59.248
(Bryan grunting)

01:03:12.196 --> 01:03:15.807
Water's so good for you.

01:03:15.807 --> 01:03:18.530
And now, you're gonna get
that shower you so desired.

01:03:28.487 --> 01:03:29.570
- Stop! Stop!

01:03:31.237 --> 01:03:32.070
Oh God.

01:03:32.917 --> 01:03:34.084
What the hell.

01:03:38.069 --> 01:03:40.736
(gunshot bangs)

01:03:42.593 --> 01:03:45.260
(neck cracking)

01:03:46.206 --> 01:03:48.767
(gunshot bangs)

01:03:48.767 --> 01:03:50.163
- Fucker shot me!

01:03:52.224 --> 01:03:53.536
- You okay.

01:03:53.536 --> 01:03:54.995
- What do you think?

01:03:54.995 --> 01:03:56.840
I'm fuckin' shot.

01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:59.290
At least I got to piss
all over the motherfucker.

01:04:01.273 --> 01:04:02.510
How's Angel?

01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:04.060
- [Berretta] I'll check on her.

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:06.633
- She's gone.

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:09.753
- What?

01:04:13.130 --> 01:04:14.097
Take me to her.

01:04:33.788 --> 01:04:35.410
Just let me lie here for a while.

01:04:35.410 --> 01:04:38.563
Get me my phone and go
and finish this thing.

01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:43.500
- Here, take this and here, here.

01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:45.050
Put pressure on the wound.

01:04:45.050 --> 01:04:47.060
Hold it there and we'll be right back.

01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:49.020
Okay, I promise baby.

01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:50.890
- I'll be fine here with Angel.

01:04:50.890 --> 01:04:52.340
She always looked out for me.

01:04:53.657 --> 01:04:55.157
Just go take care of business.

01:04:59.708 --> 01:05:02.291
I bet this gets a lot of likes.

01:05:04.407 --> 01:05:06.560
- [Berretta] You know,
she's not gonna be here

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:08.030
when we get back.

01:05:08.030 --> 01:05:10.753
- [Kitty] Yeah well, that's
what she would have wanted.

01:05:12.570 --> 01:05:13.683
- What are you doing?

01:05:15.830 --> 01:05:17.730
- Trying to find someone to help Trix.

01:05:18.656 --> 01:05:19.940
- Any luck?

01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:22.090
- Nope, not yet.

01:05:22.090 --> 01:05:25.380
But looks like this guy's
up at that structure

01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:26.323
right up there.

01:05:33.283 --> 01:05:35.913
- It's time we break out the big guns.

01:05:43.686 --> 01:05:44.519
- Finally.

01:05:55.398 --> 01:05:58.126
- Okay, see that board over there.

01:05:58.126 --> 01:06:00.507
I'm gonna position myself right over there

01:06:00.507 --> 01:06:02.770
and I want you right there.

01:06:02.770 --> 01:06:05.410
Once in position, follow my lead,

01:06:05.410 --> 01:06:07.680
we're gonna blow the
shit out of this place.

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:10.010
- Looks like that guy's
just sitting there.

01:06:10.010 --> 01:06:11.673
Let's light him up.

01:06:12.810 --> 01:06:14.320
- Take your position.

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:17.060
I'm gonna go right for the
door and call this fucker out.

01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:18.438
- Gotcha.

01:06:18.438 --> 01:06:19.838
Oh, hey Berretta.

01:06:19.838 --> 01:06:20.686
- Yeah.

01:06:20.686 --> 01:06:21.870
- I love you girl.

01:06:21.870 --> 01:06:22.703
- I know.

01:06:22.703 --> 01:06:24.337
- And we're gonna finish this shit.

01:06:24.337 --> 01:06:25.504
- Yeah we are.

01:06:32.177 --> 01:06:36.337
Come on motherfucker I
know you're in there.

01:06:36.337 --> 01:06:38.180
We already have your friends

01:06:38.180 --> 01:06:39.880
and it's time to collect from you.

01:06:43.798 --> 01:06:45.215
Come on be a man.

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:48.283
Come out and meet your maker.

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:51.197
You have five seconds.

01:06:55.077 --> 01:06:58.638
(gunfire rattling)

01:06:58.638 --> 01:07:01.555
(gunshots banging)

01:07:11.348 --> 01:07:12.898
- Ah, I think I chipped a nail.

01:07:13.765 --> 01:07:16.765
Oh well, besides that, gotta reload.

01:07:36.415 --> 01:07:38.433
- Oh look, your girl's waking up.

01:07:49.615 --> 01:07:51.448
- You doin' okay baby.

01:07:53.386 --> 01:07:54.219
- Yeah.

01:07:55.424 --> 01:07:56.700
What the fuck?

01:07:56.700 --> 01:07:58.343
- Exactly, what the fuck.

01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:02.040
Just a little payback for all the bullshit

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:03.844
you've put me through.

01:08:03.844 --> 01:08:05.100
- What the fuck are you talking about?

01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:07.070
- Remember whenever I
first started, no matter

01:08:07.070 --> 01:08:09.750
who my customers were you
had to take them from me.

01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:11.170
Every single one of them.

01:08:11.170 --> 01:08:12.910
Remember?

01:08:12.910 --> 01:08:15.360
- What the fuck are you talking about.

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:18.750
- You know exactly what
the fuck I'm talking about.

01:08:18.750 --> 01:08:20.689
Oh and Monique and the rest of the girls

01:08:20.689 --> 01:08:22.874
just let you get away with it.

01:08:22.874 --> 01:08:25.613
Let me introduce you to Jamie.

01:08:26.850 --> 01:08:30.370
Jamie and I have been planning
this for six months now.

01:08:30.370 --> 01:08:32.390
He's the only one you've never met

01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:34.460
and never taken from me.

01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:36.143
And it's about to be all mine.

01:08:37.229 --> 01:08:38.393
- Just like we planned.

01:08:40.015 --> 01:08:40.848
- Fuck you.

01:08:40.848 --> 01:08:42.625
We did everything for you.

01:08:42.625 --> 01:08:44.880
- The hell you did.

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:47.423
Jamie, we've got all the money.

01:08:48.283 --> 01:08:50.684
There's about to be nobody
that can identify us.

01:08:52.145 --> 01:08:55.479
Get over here and finish off this bitch.

01:08:55.479 --> 01:08:56.630
It was nice knowing ya?

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:58.800
- Sorry about this baby.

01:09:02.154 --> 01:09:05.156
(gunshot banging)

01:09:05.156 --> 01:09:08.573
- And who do you think sent Jamie to you.

01:09:09.575 --> 01:09:11.593
You stupid bitch.

01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:14.800
You did it all for us.

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:16.609
You got the combo to the safe.

01:09:16.609 --> 01:09:18.859
You set the plan in action.

01:09:18.859 --> 01:09:22.403
I just had to come in and clean it all up.

01:09:27.506 --> 01:09:29.339
Baby you were so good.

01:09:36.665 --> 01:09:38.015
(siren blaring)

01:09:38.015 --> 01:09:40.848
(explosion boomd)

01:09:43.255 --> 01:09:46.005
(dramatic music)

01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:54.240
- Do you know the difference

01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:56.793
between a lollipop and a sucker?

01:10:01.270 --> 01:10:02.623
Now that is a question.

01:10:04.010 --> 01:10:05.330
- It's the same thing.

01:10:05.330 --> 01:10:08.020
- No, it's not.

01:10:08.020 --> 01:10:09.440
It's not.

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:13.393
You see, a lollipop is candy.

01:10:14.930 --> 01:10:15.813
You can lick it.

01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:18.000
A sucker, well...

01:10:20.620 --> 01:10:22.020
It's just a gullible person.

01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:29.040
- Look man, we're gonna
give you the money back.

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:30.963
- Which am I?

01:10:32.350 --> 01:10:33.573
- What are you talking about?

01:10:33.573 --> 01:10:36.853
- Am I a lollipop or am I a sucker.

01:10:39.554 --> 01:10:42.853
Before you answer, there
is one thing to consider.

01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:45.590
You see a sucker is soft.

01:10:47.283 --> 01:10:49.970
You can put it into your mouth.

01:10:49.970 --> 01:10:54.970
A lollipop is just too fucking big.

01:10:57.850 --> 01:10:58.935
- You're a lollipop.

01:10:58.935 --> 01:11:01.602
(gunshot bangs)

01:11:03.724 --> 01:11:05.290
- Shit!

01:11:05.290 --> 01:11:07.220
You shot the Kaiser.

01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:09.123
- He was going to kill you.

01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:12.284
- Look baby, I've always got your back.

01:11:12.284 --> 01:11:14.914
You're the only one for me.

01:11:14.914 --> 01:11:17.274
- I can't believe this worked.

01:11:17.274 --> 01:11:19.650
- Thanks for the texts you sent me

01:11:19.650 --> 01:11:21.600
letting me know you were gonna be here.

01:11:22.884 --> 01:11:25.124
And sorry I hit you so hard.

01:11:25.124 --> 01:11:27.373
- Baby, did you get all the money.

01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:30.800
- She brought me the money
you got off the other guys

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:32.154
mine's over there.

01:11:32.154 --> 01:11:34.074
- (chuckling) oh my god.

01:11:34.074 --> 01:11:35.980
He was right.

01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:37.259
- What?

01:11:37.259 --> 01:11:38.547
- You are a sucker.

01:11:38.547 --> 01:11:39.797
- But we have it all.

01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:41.493
- I have it all.

01:11:41.493 --> 01:11:44.020
(gunshot bangs)

01:11:44.020 --> 01:11:46.687
(ominous music)

01:12:58.968 --> 01:13:02.218
(upbeat country music)

01:13:24.411 --> 01:13:26.461
- Hey can you get the fuck out of my sun.

01:13:29.190 --> 01:13:30.400
Where the fuck did you come from?

01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:32.419
- The sequel bitch.

01:13:32.419 --> 01:13:34.752
(gun bangs)

01:13:35.799 --> 01:13:38.466
(ominous music)
