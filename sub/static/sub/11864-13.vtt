01:10.320 --> 01:14.448
Sometimes
I wonder if I haunt my sister.

01:15.241 --> 01:18.112
When she's laying there
in the morning and it's all quiet,

01:18.244 --> 01:20.367
I wonder if she's thinking about me.

01:20.497 --> 01:24.162
She's 11. She's probably
just thinking about a boy... or breakfast.

01:25.460 --> 01:27.583
Or flying away.

01:38.640 --> 01:42.969
Once a year my family
goes to this cabin by a lake.

01:43.103 --> 01:47.017
On the road by ten.
Three hours out, we'd stop at a store

01:47.148 --> 01:49.770
where this guy
who looked like Colonel Sanders

01:49.901 --> 01:52.357
would give me some home-made taffy.

01:52.487 --> 01:54.895
Then three hours
with the windows down,

01:55.031 --> 01:59.195
just as my stomach would start to growl,
there we were:

01:59.327 --> 02:05.200
at the rental office with the clock
in the shape of a cat's face to pick up the key.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.371
By the time I got to high school,

02:12.507 --> 02:16.339
I thought I was too cool
to go on vacation with my family.

02:16.469 --> 02:20.799
I'd complain and act all sullen
most of the time I was there.

02:20.932 --> 02:23.008
It's what I did best.

02:23.143 --> 02:27.271
Now they were heading up there
for the first time since I died

02:27.397 --> 02:30.896
and all I could think about
was that I wanted to go.

02:31.026 --> 02:34.145
That I wanted
to be on vacation with them.

02:35.321 --> 02:40.529
Rube once told me
that haunting is all about envy.

02:43.079 --> 02:45.451
I'm beginning to understand.

02:51.212 --> 02:55.127
I said I hated going to that lake
when I was in high school.

02:55.258 --> 02:59.920
I was lying. Every summer
I couldn't wait to get up there.

03:09.606 --> 03:14.481
- Hey, Reg. How're you doing?
- Good. Dad's letting me use his knife.

03:15.737 --> 03:20.980
- What are you going to do with it?
- I was thinking of whittling something.

03:21.117 --> 03:24.035
Trade you the fishing pole for the knife.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.788
OK.

03:37.467 --> 03:42.378
Did you ever feel good and bad
about something at the same time?

03:42.514 --> 03:45.515
You know, really conflicted?

03:45.642 --> 03:49.770
I once had sex
with the pilot of a 77 477 in flight.

03:49.896 --> 03:53.479
The sex was great,
but I was sure we were gonna die.

03:53.608 --> 03:58.768
Flying used to be an entirely
different experience. It was more genteel.

03:58.905 --> 04:02.321
Yeah. Can't get into that cockpit
any more, so to speak.

04:02.450 --> 04:05.368
People dressed up. You could smoke.

04:06.621 --> 04:11.117
- They'd serve a highball in a nice glass.
- Can I have my assignment?

04:11.251 --> 04:13.576
- Where's the fire?
- In my pants.

04:13.712 --> 04:16.036
That's probably syphilis.

04:16.172 --> 04:19.956
Hey, can you steal me a car?

04:20.093 --> 04:24.885
First of all, the correct phrase is "boost".
Second, I'm not a used car lot.

04:25.015 --> 04:29.012
And, darling, you really have to learn
to steal your own cars.

04:29.144 --> 04:33.521
- Why do you want a car?
- You gonna knock over a liquor store?

04:33.648 --> 04:39.188
No. I was thinking about... getting away.

04:39.320 --> 04:42.238
I've always wanted
to knock over a liquor store.

04:42.365 --> 04:46.695
- I could help you out there.
- OK. We'll be the next Bonnie and Clyde.

04:46.828 --> 04:48.904
- Really?
- No, never. Not ever.

04:49.039 --> 04:53.499
Forget about the car, OK.
Rube, can I please have my Post-it?

04:56.671 --> 05:00.171
- Here. I'm leaving.
- No, you're not. Sit down.

05:01.551 --> 05:04.801
Hello, hello? I'm sitting here.

05:07.223 --> 05:09.133
Rube, I really have to go.

05:10.185 --> 05:12.640
- Joy, are you ready to go?
- Almost.

05:12.771 --> 05:15.522
- Reggie, are you packing?
- Yes.

05:15.648 --> 05:18.056
Will we get there in time to go swimming?

05:18.193 --> 05:20.600
I don't know. Maybe.

05:22.572 --> 05:27.530
- Well?
- Just ask me, OK?

05:27.660 --> 05:33.117
- If you would like me to do something, ask me.
- Don't fucking start.

05:35.752 --> 05:38.041
Hello? Hello?

05:40.590 --> 05:43.046
- You keep that ledger in your head.
- What?

05:43.176 --> 05:47.470
The master list
of all the things I do wrong.

05:47.597 --> 05:50.764
I would like to get there by nightfall

05:50.892 --> 05:53.015
and I wanna stop at the taffy store.

05:57.732 --> 06:00.935
Hello? Oh, come on! Hello?

06:02.237 --> 06:04.858
- Who's that?
- Must have been a wrong number.

06:04.989 --> 06:07.563
Must have been. Flashlight.

06:10.245 --> 06:12.533
- Do you want to go?
- Of course.

06:12.664 --> 06:16.364
Come on. You're lying. You're such a liar.

06:16.501 --> 06:18.624
You don't fool me.

06:19.671 --> 06:25.258
I wanted to tell Reggie
it would be OK, even though I didn't believe it.

06:25.385 --> 06:28.718
Rube, it's time
we hand out the assignments, please.

06:28.847 --> 06:30.804
There are no assignments today.

06:30.932 --> 06:33.423
- What?
- No one's dying today.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.766
- Really?
- Look over there.

06:35.895 --> 06:39.893
Don't look right at it.
You've got to look askance.

06:40.025 --> 06:42.266
- A what?
- Askance.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.728
Out of the corner of your eye.

06:53.121 --> 06:55.694
Gravelings are taking the day off.

06:56.791 --> 07:01.252
- They do it every few years.
- Why?

07:01.379 --> 07:06.172
Think of it like an eclipse.
It's just the way the planets align.

07:06.301 --> 07:08.708
No one dies today.

07:08.845 --> 07:12.179
Tell me this means
we get a three-day weekend.

07:21.316 --> 07:23.273
Cocksucker.

07:25.904 --> 07:29.024
Fuck! I'm not getting it!

07:56.685 --> 07:58.761
Don't even answer it.

07:58.895 --> 08:02.893
Hello? Hello. Just a second.

08:03.024 --> 08:07.188
It's school nonsense.
I'm gonna take it in the office.

08:17.539 --> 08:21.453
- We gotta do filing?
- Paperwork.

08:21.584 --> 08:25.416
For every soul the division's ever taken.
I'm a little behind.

08:25.547 --> 08:29.496
Why is it my karmic destiny
to do paperwork?

08:29.634 --> 08:33.583
Wherever I go, I'm a temp.

08:33.722 --> 08:38.384
- It's all gotta be organised and logged.
- You're locking up my section.

08:38.518 --> 08:42.645
- We got work to do.
- Then work has to order.

08:42.772 --> 08:44.646
I hear you.

08:44.774 --> 08:49.152
This pile's a scrambled, side of browns.
This pile wants the Belgians.

08:49.279 --> 08:52.030
This pile would like the Benedict,
easy on the Hollandaise.

08:52.157 --> 08:56.285
Four black coffees
and give booth six another pitcher of mimosas.

08:56.411 --> 08:57.989
Booth six is empty.

09:15.680 --> 09:20.223
OK, JD. First we jump in the water
'cause you need to know how to swim.

09:20.352 --> 09:25.097
- We can make a fire tonight, right?
- Mm. Blazing.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.901
Maybe I'll catch a fish and cook it.

09:28.026 --> 09:31.276
- I don't know if there's wood.
- I'll collect it.

09:31.404 --> 09:35.153
George used to collect driftwood.
I remember.

09:37.952 --> 09:40.360
So we'll have a fire.

09:41.706 --> 09:45.371
Each white sheet has
all the information on a single death.

09:45.502 --> 09:48.871
We categorise the sheets
and copy them into the ledgers.

09:49.005 --> 09:51.959
How are you gonna
want to access the data?

09:52.092 --> 09:54.761
- What?
- When it's all done.

09:54.886 --> 09:57.804
Do you just wanna access them
chronologically?

09:57.931 --> 10:02.925
If you wanna get more complex,
you'll have to give each record an identifier

10:03.061 --> 10:05.848
so that you can do cross tabs.

10:07.023 --> 10:10.475
When you put
so much effort into hating your job,

10:10.610 --> 10:14.275
it's easy not to notice
you're learning something.

10:14.406 --> 10:16.363
My system works fine.

10:16.491 --> 10:19.611
Are we alphabetising
by first or last name?

10:21.287 --> 10:24.739
Have you ever seen anyone
alphabetised by first name?

10:24.874 --> 10:29.335
I'm simply trying to understand
what it is we are doing.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.577
Wow!

10:30.714 --> 10:35.174
- Daisy didn't ask that to piss you off.
- Thank you.

10:35.301 --> 10:39.133
She asked that 'cause she can't shut up.
Neither of you can.

10:39.264 --> 10:43.178
- Listen to the man and shut the fuck up.
- Thank you.

10:43.309 --> 10:48.470
These are filed by last thought.
It's written on the back of each page.

10:48.606 --> 10:51.442
You only give us
names, addresses and ETDs.

10:51.568 --> 10:54.273
Yes. That is not all I get.

10:55.739 --> 10:57.612
Last thought.

10:57.741 --> 11:02.486
"I should have apologised to Mr Roy
about the broken phonograph."

11:02.620 --> 11:07.413
- What the fuck do I file that under?
- Categories reveal themselves as we go.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.245
So let's get going.

11:16.801 --> 11:19.968
It was strange to think
that while we worked,

11:20.096 --> 11:23.596
all over town, death was taking a break.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.105
Not that anyone noticed.

11:38.239 --> 11:40.991
Death is kind of like sex in high school.

11:44.412 --> 11:48.955
If you knew how many times
you missed having it, you'd be paralysed.

11:50.251 --> 11:54.664
- What have we got here?
- Shoulda. Woulda. Coulda.

11:54.798 --> 11:57.502
Has anyone seen
a sheet for IA Newman?

11:57.634 --> 12:01.334
- Who knows?
- Isadore Newman? I remember him.

12:01.471 --> 12:05.884
Piano tuner. Liked the symphony
and paintings by Degas.

12:06.017 --> 12:12.815
He was working on a baby grand. Piano string
snapped, right in the face. Blinded him.

12:12.941 --> 12:17.935
He stood up and knocked the lid
and it smacked down on his first vertebra.

12:18.071 --> 12:21.440
- Broke his neck.
- What time is it?

12:21.574 --> 12:26.782
- It's five past five.
- I gotta go to the bathroom.

12:30.667 --> 12:33.074
I don't think it's healthy to schedule that.

12:45.098 --> 12:48.681
George, tell Mom the heater's on.
Half an hour till we can shower.

12:48.810 --> 12:52.096
Mom! Heater's on.
Half an hour till it's hot.

12:52.230 --> 12:54.472
I'm not showering for five days.

12:54.607 --> 12:58.557
Tell your father he's lucky
if I even brush my teeth!

12:58.695 --> 12:59.857
Really?

13:01.573 --> 13:04.989
No. And you're gonna
be brushing your teeth too.

13:05.118 --> 13:08.202
Can we roast marshmallows
over the fire tonight?

13:08.329 --> 13:12.493
- We're gonna have all week.
- Please? Reggie loves marshmallows.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.461
I think we'll stick with bottles for Reggie.

13:15.587 --> 13:20.664
- Mom loves marshmallows.
- Why don't we just relax?

13:20.800 --> 13:23.291
- Tomorrow, I promise.
- OK.

13:23.428 --> 13:26.263
It's vacation. We have all week.

13:27.349 --> 13:29.056
Whatever.

13:30.560 --> 13:34.510
- Hey! Go get the marshmallows.
- Yes!

13:39.986 --> 13:44.648
"I wish I'd taken better care of Lucy.
I shouldn't have put Jezebel to sleep."

13:44.783 --> 13:47.618
Pet regrets, spouse regrets on that table.

13:47.744 --> 13:51.195
- I'll go with pet regrets. Which stack?
- Big one.

13:51.331 --> 13:56.289
Daisy, out of the massive collection
of sex stories you've told us,

13:56.419 --> 13:58.495
I've noticed there's no Brits.

13:58.630 --> 14:03.126
- Alec Guinness, Rex Harrison, Richard Burton...
- Richard Burton's Welsh.

14:03.259 --> 14:05.632
I can't believe he never won an Oscar.

14:05.762 --> 14:10.340
Daisy, let's not pretend.
Me and you: nasty little spark there.

14:10.475 --> 14:12.764
No. Non. Nyet. Nein. Nada. Never.

14:12.894 --> 14:15.729
Right then. Wager. If I win, you kiss me.

14:16.773 --> 14:19.976
Fine. Call it.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.687
Tails.

14:23.279 --> 14:26.364
- Oh. Mason...
- Yeah.

14:26.491 --> 14:29.658
You don't have any money,
your hygiene is suspect,

14:29.786 --> 14:33.534
your clothes alone disqualify you
and you're not even alive.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.794
Pet regrets.

14:44.759 --> 14:46.835
- More coffee?
- Thanks.

14:46.970 --> 14:49.887
- How are you doing?
- Thanks for asking.

14:50.015 --> 14:54.475
People don't ask that much any more
or, if they do, they don't care.

14:54.602 --> 14:58.932
That's the truth.
People just want to hear themselves talk.

14:59.065 --> 15:03.858
Like when my son calls,
every two months to never,

15:03.987 --> 15:08.483
he only wants to borrow money
or complain about his sister.

15:08.616 --> 15:11.570
She's the smart one
until it comes to the OTB.

15:11.703 --> 15:14.372
Then it's 500 on the trifecta.

15:14.497 --> 15:18.162
I mean, I can understand the rush,
but 500 dollars...?

15:25.675 --> 15:29.839
Can we go to the water?
JD wants to go. Can I go fishing?

15:33.933 --> 15:37.219
I wouldn't have thought
you'd get reception up here.

15:38.313 --> 15:42.061
Let's unpack the car,
then we'll see about fishing.

15:42.192 --> 15:47.019
- Why d'you bring the cellphone?
- In case any of us got into trouble.

16:09.260 --> 16:11.716
What happens
when we make all the piles?

16:11.846 --> 16:14.681
We copy each sheet into the ledgers.

16:14.808 --> 16:17.381
- By hand?
- Yes, by hand.

16:17.519 --> 16:19.143
This is useless.

16:19.270 --> 16:24.894
You know what's a lost art? Calligraphy.
No one uses fountain pens any more.

16:25.026 --> 16:29.273
It'd be much faster to copy them
into a computer file.

16:29.406 --> 16:33.653
Death hasn't really evolved much
since pre-Gutenberg Bible days.

16:33.785 --> 16:36.656
Reaping doesn't lend itself
to Microsoft Outlook.

16:36.788 --> 16:43.455
You mean Excel, not Outlook.
It's just another way of organising information.

16:43.586 --> 16:47.002
Death may not have evolved,
but data entry has.

16:47.132 --> 16:50.666
- Why don't we have a computer?
- Amen!

16:50.802 --> 16:53.423
I may regret saying this,

16:53.555 --> 16:58.264
but my old office
was always empty at this hour.

16:58.393 --> 17:00.718
This is what I used to do at Happy Time.

17:00.854 --> 17:04.982
- Used to do?
- I still have keys.

17:05.108 --> 17:09.604
- I got fresh fountain pens for everybody.
- I have delicate hands.

17:09.738 --> 17:14.779
We cannot copy down
all this information by hand. Look at it!

17:14.909 --> 17:18.990
- If you focus, start right...
- Fuck that shit, Rube!

17:19.122 --> 17:21.613
I need a goddamn laptop.

17:27.172 --> 17:29.045
Happy Time it is.

17:30.091 --> 17:33.211
There's Monopoly. Maybe we could play.

17:33.345 --> 17:36.096
You know what, Reg? I'm wiped out.

17:36.222 --> 17:41.727
- You and your mother go ahead and play.
- You can't play with just two people.

17:41.853 --> 17:45.518
I'm exhausted, sweetie.
I'll catch you next time.

17:52.697 --> 17:56.944
I say we ignore these dishes
and break out the Monopoly.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.662
Forget it.

18:00.789 --> 18:02.828
Reg?

18:02.957 --> 18:06.373
It doesn't work with just two people.

18:07.962 --> 18:09.505
Reggie?

18:11.007 --> 18:13.047
What?

18:13.176 --> 18:17.304
- We'll go fishing in the morning.
- OK.

18:37.867 --> 18:43.787
We can set up in the conference room
and use some cubicles for the data entry.

18:44.833 --> 18:47.787
I want this one. It smells like pot-pourri.

18:47.919 --> 18:50.375
That's Marie's. She has gum disease.

18:50.505 --> 18:52.498
What time your fellow cogs roll in?

18:52.632 --> 18:57.259
Some guy comes in around dawn
to call the Philippines.

18:57.387 --> 19:00.388
The cleaning crew's been.
What time is it?

19:00.515 --> 19:02.887
It's 8.30.

19:03.018 --> 19:05.094
Night, George.

19:07.397 --> 19:10.600
- Is she sleepy?
- She's getting there.

19:11.651 --> 19:15.815
She's so boring.
All she does is sleep and poop.

19:15.947 --> 19:18.403
Same as you did, young lady.

19:18.533 --> 19:23.954
- Do you think she'll be as smart as I am?
- Oh, I hope so.

19:24.080 --> 19:26.785
Goodnight, Georgia.

19:26.916 --> 19:31.578
- Leave it open.
- We're gonna be up talking for a while.

19:31.713 --> 19:33.955
I like that.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.133
Night-night.

19:41.848 --> 19:45.347
If we split into pairs,
we can catalogue it all by morning.

19:45.477 --> 19:49.391
- What pairs?
- One person reads, one person types.

19:49.522 --> 19:52.891
- Hear that, Daisy? Pairs.
- I'm gonna work alone.

19:53.026 --> 19:56.940
There are five of us,
so somebody has to be alone.

19:57.072 --> 20:00.772
- I'm supervising.
- What is there to supervise?

20:00.909 --> 20:04.444
I'm gonna copy some of the data
into the ledger to be safe.

20:04.579 --> 20:07.248
- You don't need to.
- What if it gets lost?

20:07.374 --> 20:10.458
There's a tape backup
and it saves to an off-site server.

20:10.585 --> 20:13.621
Chim-cham and goo-gaas
to a hoo-ha whimmy whizzle.

20:13.755 --> 20:17.622
You wanna use your fountain pen,
you go for it.

20:17.759 --> 20:22.551
But after a long night and you manage
to cover three pages, feel good about it.

20:22.681 --> 20:25.218
What was that?

20:41.157 --> 20:43.529
Fucking gravelings.

20:43.660 --> 20:46.993
They don't have anything better to do
on their day off?

20:49.290 --> 20:51.960
"I should have gone
to art school."

20:55.880 --> 20:58.454
"I should have said yes."

21:00.260 --> 21:03.095
- "I should have..."
- Wait. I should have what?

21:03.221 --> 21:06.804
- Said yes.
- There's a lot of that going around.

21:07.684 --> 21:09.475
Please!

21:10.812 --> 21:14.430
OK. I'm not your type. So who is?

21:14.566 --> 21:16.854
- "I should have held her hand..."
- Daisy.

21:16.985 --> 21:19.820
Come on, seriously. Tell me.

21:21.948 --> 21:24.024
My type?

21:25.577 --> 21:27.486
Where to begin?

21:29.247 --> 21:32.912
There needs to be something
about the way the man looks

21:33.043 --> 21:36.127
gives me chills in the back of the neck.

21:36.254 --> 21:40.833
Rich is good. OK, rich is imperative.

21:40.967 --> 21:45.047
Rich and famous, a lethal combination.

21:45.180 --> 21:48.430
I had a guy who shall remain...
Bing Crosby.

21:48.558 --> 21:53.469
.. who sent me two dozen lilies every day
for the seven months we were together.

21:53.605 --> 21:59.975
After we broke it off,
I fell for a big cheese over at MGM.

22:00.612 --> 22:05.606
He promised me an exclusive studio
contract when his divorce came through.

22:05.742 --> 22:10.320
Then there was the senator,
also married...

22:12.040 --> 22:14.116
"It's freezing."

22:18.254 --> 22:20.828
"Momma, oh, Momma."

22:25.970 --> 22:28.212
"I give up."

22:30.517 --> 22:33.886
"Fuck! It's just seaweed."

22:42.987 --> 22:46.072
- What pile is this?
- Mid-ocean deaths.

22:47.117 --> 22:49.323
- Let me type.
- I'm getting better.

22:49.452 --> 22:51.908
- No, you're not.
- It's the keys.

22:52.038 --> 22:54.280
You breathe on them, they go down.

22:54.416 --> 22:58.330
I had an old Manhattan B
and the thing was a Gatling.

22:58.461 --> 23:01.213
- Let me type, Rube.
- I'm getting better.

23:03.299 --> 23:06.217
Everything's in caps. Oh, fuck!

23:45.800 --> 23:48.587
- Mom?
- Did I wake you?

23:48.720 --> 23:51.425
What are you reading?

23:51.556 --> 23:55.423
It's called Cat's Cradle. Someone left it.

23:55.560 --> 23:59.724
I love it. I love the books
that people leave here.

23:59.856 --> 24:02.312
Why don't people steal them?

24:02.442 --> 24:07.685
I don't know. They're the kind of books
you wouldn't read at home.

24:07.822 --> 24:10.278
I want to take them all home.

24:10.408 --> 24:13.445
- Why?
- 'Cause they make you happy.

24:13.578 --> 24:16.199
- Who's happy?
- Everybody.

24:18.249 --> 24:20.408
What time is it?

24:20.835 --> 24:24.619
I'm one of the few people
who can know for sure,

24:24.756 --> 24:29.963
but the only thing as random
and unlikely as my death was my birth.

24:30.095 --> 24:32.882
Hello, Larry! Yeah!

24:33.014 --> 24:36.348
Johnny boy, how's it hanging? Yes!

24:36.476 --> 24:39.596
Mary? What's the 411? Eh?

24:39.729 --> 24:42.516
What the hell are you doing?

24:42.649 --> 24:45.270
I'm pretending
to care about these people.

24:45.402 --> 24:51.606
Oh. Well, the guy who sits in that cubicle
has a website dedicated to rare buttons.

24:51.741 --> 24:56.617
And the woman who sits in there
has phone sex with a high-school senior

24:56.746 --> 24:59.664
from New Mexico. Native American.

24:59.791 --> 25:02.626
And the woman who sits over there...

25:03.670 --> 25:05.793
.. is sitting over there.

25:06.840 --> 25:08.879
Crystal?

25:09.009 --> 25:13.469
- We have a problem.
- I don't think it's a problem.

25:13.596 --> 25:16.681
- Gravelings?
- Hm... weirder.

25:23.648 --> 25:28.559
It's fine. She said she came here
to water her plants.

25:29.904 --> 25:32.111
She offered to help.

25:32.240 --> 25:35.027
Does she know
you're no longer employed here?

25:35.160 --> 25:39.027
It's really hard to tell what Crystal knows.

25:40.206 --> 25:44.453
It's 2.30. We have a lot more to do.

25:44.586 --> 25:46.377
Does it type?

25:46.504 --> 25:48.627
"How could she do it?"

25:48.757 --> 25:53.134
"How could he do it?"
"Why did she do this?"

25:53.261 --> 25:55.420
Am I going too fast? Sure?

25:56.348 --> 26:00.476
"This'll show her."
"He won't forget me now."

26:00.602 --> 26:02.310
"No."

26:04.064 --> 26:05.772
"Yes."

26:07.984 --> 26:10.060
"Now, that's ironic."

26:12.322 --> 26:16.783
Older men are fine.
Older men can be delightful.

26:16.910 --> 26:20.824
They demand less, they're attentive
to their personal hygiene,

26:20.955 --> 26:23.197
they give fabulous gifts.

26:23.333 --> 26:26.038
They're always really grateful.

26:27.587 --> 26:31.038
Though they very, very rarely
leave their wives.

26:34.010 --> 26:37.426
That was informative.
Shall we take a stab at these?

26:37.555 --> 26:39.963
Yeah. You read, I type.

26:41.976 --> 26:43.519
"Why?"

26:43.645 --> 26:47.180
- Because I'm the better typist.
- Last thought.

26:47.315 --> 26:51.360
Oh. "Why?" Short and sweet.

26:52.529 --> 26:55.233
Hm. "I wish I had someone."

26:55.365 --> 26:57.938
"I wish I had someone."

27:00.036 --> 27:02.444
"Is anyone there?"

27:03.707 --> 27:06.910
"Why can't somebody be with me?"

27:09.921 --> 27:12.673
"Born alone, die alone."

27:19.681 --> 27:22.254
"I feel empty."

27:34.487 --> 27:38.900
We're making good progress, peanut.
Ahead of schedule.

27:39.034 --> 27:44.324
Dolores always said I was excellent
at implementing action plans.

27:44.456 --> 27:46.744
They were lucky to have had you.

27:46.875 --> 27:52.331
Had you stayed, maybe you would have been
Happy Time worker of the year.

27:52.464 --> 27:55.548
I guess. Why are we doing all this?

27:55.675 --> 27:59.424
You mean, if a tree falls in a forest
who gives a fuck?

27:59.554 --> 28:03.552
Yeah. Like, who is all this work for?

28:03.683 --> 28:06.518
You know Henry Ward Beecher's
last words?

28:06.644 --> 28:08.055
No.

28:08.188 --> 28:12.316
"Now comes the mystery." Beautiful.

28:12.442 --> 28:15.359
- Know what his last thoughts were?
- No.

28:15.487 --> 28:19.650
Me neither. I haven't
been able to find his paperwork.

28:19.783 --> 28:23.531
We're witnesses, peanut.
Everyone matters.

28:25.997 --> 28:29.580
But who is all this work for?

28:29.709 --> 28:32.959
Anyone that's interested. Are you?

28:34.172 --> 28:38.122
Yes. You can't smoke in here.

28:38.259 --> 28:40.833
Fuck that bullshit. They can blow me.

28:43.765 --> 28:47.549
- I've got a question.
- Yes, you're burning it.

28:47.686 --> 28:52.976
- No, you don't have to eat it.
- No. Why can't we live here?

28:53.108 --> 28:55.100
- Here?
- In this cabin.

28:55.235 --> 28:59.067
- You couldn't fit half your toys in.
- I don't need my toys.

28:59.197 --> 29:02.780
- I'd like to see that!
- I could live here.

29:02.909 --> 29:05.067
Let's do it for real.

29:05.203 --> 29:08.406
Sometimes I look
at all the crap in our house,

29:08.540 --> 29:13.166
all those things we needed.
I could do without.

29:13.294 --> 29:18.918
- Are you gonna make George jump in the lake?
- I'm not jumping in the lake!

29:19.050 --> 29:24.008
I'm serious. If we didn't have to work so hard
to make the money,

29:24.139 --> 29:28.884
we wouldn't have to spend the money
to feel better for working so hard.

29:29.019 --> 29:33.265
- We could really live out here.
- Deep.

29:33.398 --> 29:37.230
- Shut up.
- We could have a much simpler life.

29:37.360 --> 29:43.149
Let's do it. I don't need anything back there.
I can teach Reggie about fishing.

29:44.325 --> 29:47.529
- What would we do all day?
- This.

29:54.210 --> 29:59.168
"I don't understand."
That's where that one ends.

30:00.467 --> 30:02.543
"I'm so alone."

30:06.473 --> 30:08.549
"There's nobody."

30:11.603 --> 30:15.897
- Are we almost finished?
- Yeah. A couple more.

30:17.650 --> 30:23.356
What do you say when we're done
we go back to my place for a drink?

30:23.490 --> 30:26.194
- Don't fuck with me.
- I probably won't.

30:26.326 --> 30:31.866
But a drink won't kill anyone,
least of all us. I'm guessing Jameson's.

30:31.998 --> 30:33.706
Yeah.

30:35.085 --> 30:37.042
You're not such bad company.

30:37.170 --> 30:41.250
I'm guessing with some disinfectant soap
and American dentistry,

30:41.383 --> 30:43.459
you'd clean up just fine.

30:46.721 --> 30:49.212
"I wish I'd taken better care of Lucy."

30:50.684 --> 30:53.091
That is it for this one.

30:56.606 --> 30:59.642
You're just checking it over? Good.

31:02.445 --> 31:04.817
You like your job?

31:04.948 --> 31:07.653
I hear you, girl.

31:07.784 --> 31:10.453
It's all just one big shrug.

31:12.414 --> 31:14.122
Paper-clips?

31:15.333 --> 31:19.247
Oh. I've organised like this too.

31:20.422 --> 31:24.040
I do not understand people
who can't find their own shit. You?

31:25.844 --> 31:28.465
Put things in their place.

31:28.596 --> 31:32.808
Then they call you anal. Like holding
your shit in has something to do

31:32.934 --> 31:36.979
with why you put the staplers
next to the stapler.

31:37.105 --> 31:42.016
"Please, please, please... I want
to hear a voice... Why am I so lonely?"

31:42.152 --> 31:44.358
Second to last page, right?

31:44.487 --> 31:47.524
This one should be "Why am I so alone?"

31:50.869 --> 31:54.403
Well, you can do the last ones without me.

31:54.539 --> 31:58.157
- Don't forget about that drink.
- No. I won't.

32:04.632 --> 32:08.500
I said, "If we're gonna share men,
we can cut 'em in half."

32:08.636 --> 32:11.507
'Cause I'm not gonna
be dating a double dipper,

32:11.639 --> 32:14.806
especially when all three of us know.
Would you?

32:14.934 --> 32:16.345
Uh-uh.

32:16.478 --> 32:20.143
I guess she thought
we were just going to chat over dinner.

32:20.273 --> 32:25.350
I moved out.
Do you think I did the right thing?

32:27.781 --> 32:29.857
We're on the same page, girl.

32:34.537 --> 32:37.242
I didn't know anyone was in here.

32:37.374 --> 32:40.908
Rube demanded a copy of the hard copy.

32:41.044 --> 32:45.255
He's still a little skittish
about the whole digital thing.

32:45.382 --> 32:46.959
Well...

32:48.134 --> 32:50.969
- You guys almost finished?
- Uh-huh.

32:52.931 --> 32:54.722
Daisy?

32:57.727 --> 32:59.803
Doesn't it bother you, Georgia?

33:01.773 --> 33:03.481
What?

33:05.110 --> 33:07.897
Everybody's thoughts are the same.

33:08.029 --> 33:11.030
Two thirds are people who regret.

33:11.157 --> 33:16.531
The rest are people
who forgot to do stuff or are praying or...

33:17.956 --> 33:19.498
.. are alone.

33:19.624 --> 33:23.918
- Shouldn't there be more?
- More what?

33:24.045 --> 33:28.209
More piles. More words. More thoughts.

33:29.551 --> 33:31.424
I guess.

33:33.638 --> 33:38.881
And then... And then you die
and you might become a reaper

33:39.019 --> 33:46.017
and the magic of creation turns out to be
a nine-to-five grind with lots of paperwork.

33:46.151 --> 33:47.942
It's just... It's so...

33:48.069 --> 33:50.774
It's so everyday.

33:50.905 --> 33:56.825
Lots of people leave. There's nothing
everyday about where they're going.

33:56.953 --> 33:59.029
How do you know that's true?

33:59.164 --> 34:03.161
Maybe we just keep moving
from one filing job to the next.

34:03.293 --> 34:07.504
Oh, my God. We're all temps.

34:07.630 --> 34:13.799
It was strange to hear
the secret of the universe from a starlet

34:13.928 --> 34:18.056
in a copy room
at three o'clock in the morning.

34:18.183 --> 34:22.179
But considering what the secret was,
it was perfect.

34:32.614 --> 34:36.742
I hate spiders. Please kill it.
Just please kill it for me.

34:36.868 --> 34:41.032
- Clancy, don't be such a pussy.
- I have a phobia about spiders!

34:41.164 --> 34:44.947
See if you can find somebody
who gives a flying fuck.

34:51.591 --> 34:54.675
That's the thing about life, isn't it?

35:26.334 --> 35:32.254
How can something be so boring
and extraordinary at the same time?

35:42.142 --> 35:45.261
- Georgia, time to go!
- Coming!

36:00.785 --> 36:03.407
You ready for that drink?

36:03.538 --> 36:06.658
You know what...
maybe some other time.

36:13.965 --> 36:16.539
Come on. I'll walk you out, Daisy.

36:30.315 --> 36:32.936
Thanks for all your help.

36:33.068 --> 36:38.572
- I like your friend Roxy.
- I'm sure she likes you too.

36:40.325 --> 36:44.275
- Hey, Crystal...
- I won't tell anyone.

36:51.961 --> 36:53.835
Thank you.

36:55.882 --> 36:58.455
Hey, Rube. Can I borrow your truck?

37:08.770 --> 37:11.391
God, you're up early this morning, Reg.

37:12.607 --> 37:14.683
Want some hot chocolate?

37:14.818 --> 37:16.561
Um... no.

37:16.695 --> 37:19.649
- How about some oatmeal?
- No.

37:19.781 --> 37:21.323
Thank you.

37:22.867 --> 37:27.114
- How did JD sleep?
- Fine.

37:28.581 --> 37:30.124
Good.

37:31.626 --> 37:33.749
Are you OK?

37:35.839 --> 37:38.626
No. Are you?

37:43.096 --> 37:44.887
No.

37:46.850 --> 37:49.685
Are the fish biting this morning?

37:57.193 --> 37:58.937
I miss her.

38:06.327 --> 38:11.488
Maybe... we could go
someplace different next summer.

38:16.087 --> 38:17.118
OK.

39:33.665 --> 39:36.156
Maybe Daisy was right.

39:36.292 --> 39:41.334
Maybe death was the temp job
and life was the vacation.

39:41.464 --> 39:45.711
A vacation you were supposed to spend
with the people you loved.

39:45.844 --> 39:48.679
With people who loved you.

39:48.805 --> 39:52.672
And if life was that kind of vacation,
what then?

39:52.809 --> 39:55.929
What would your last thoughts be then?
