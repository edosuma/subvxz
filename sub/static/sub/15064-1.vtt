WEBVTT

02:21.596 --> 02:22.931
Forgive me, Lord,

02:22.932 --> 02:24.265
for I am weak.

02:31.606 --> 02:32.606
What did you say?

02:35.360 --> 02:36.757
Are you willing to admit

02:36.758 --> 02:38.154
your part?

02:39.781 --> 02:43.159
I have failed my Lord.

02:44.912 --> 02:49.124
Well, I will not fail mine.

02:51.459 --> 02:53.087
Processus, stop!

02:54.462 --> 02:55.694
- What are you doing?

02:55.695 --> 02:56.924
- Getting a confession.

02:56.965 --> 02:58.259
Look at him.

02:58.260 --> 02:59.569
- From a dead man.
- You'll get no confession

02:59.593 --> 03:01.053
Water, now.

03:01.095 --> 03:02.530
- -Unchain him.
- -But we were given strict...

03:02.554 --> 03:03.554
Unchain him!

03:21.197 --> 03:22.741
He's bleeding.

03:41.093 --> 03:42.844
Thank you.

03:43.678 --> 03:44.721
Thank you.

03:46.264 --> 03:48.433
Listen to me, old man.

03:48.475 --> 03:50.561
Look around you.

03:50.562 --> 03:51.604
Where you are?

03:51.605 --> 03:52.646
Have you forgotten

03:52.687 --> 03:54.189
This is Mamertine,

03:54.190 --> 03:55.708
- in the world,
- the most secure prison

03:55.732 --> 03:57.442
And you are alone.

03:58.359 --> 03:59.444
One word from Nero

03:59.486 --> 04:01.047
- and the entire might
- of the Roman Empire

04:01.071 --> 04:02.072
Could be brought to bear

04:02.073 --> 04:03.073
on you.

04:03.991 --> 04:05.241
So why not cooperate?

04:07.035 --> 04:08.036
Tell us.

04:08.954 --> 04:09.955
Tell me.

04:10.831 --> 04:12.749
Why did you start the fires?

04:27.181 --> 04:29.829
I cannot confess

04:29.830 --> 04:32.477
to that which I did not do.

04:39.818 --> 04:40.819
Come.

04:58.003 --> 04:59.629
Be with me, Lord.

05:00.839 --> 05:02.132
Be with me.

05:15.896 --> 05:17.502
These fires have turned

05:17.503 --> 05:19.107
the city on its end.

05:19.149 --> 05:20.359
All the more reason

05:20.360 --> 05:21.568
to find these criminals.

05:22.360 --> 05:23.360
Agreed.

05:24.654 --> 05:26.656
- But finding them
- will not ease the suffering

05:26.698 --> 05:27.866
Of those who've been

05:27.867 --> 05:29.034
burned out.

05:29.076 --> 05:30.411
Or perhaps they'll find

05:30.412 --> 05:31.745
distraction in the games.

05:33.788 --> 05:35.415
The games.

05:38.501 --> 05:39.648
Yes, Honor,

05:39.649 --> 05:40.795
the games of your festival.

05:43.381 --> 05:45.425
- Never mind the games.
- Where are your priorities?

05:46.801 --> 05:48.553
I would hear from Theodus.

05:51.514 --> 05:53.159
- Honor, we have been working
- day and night

05:53.183 --> 05:54.539
But there are still hundreds

05:54.540 --> 05:55.894
of families on the street.

05:55.936 --> 05:57.355
We simply do not have the

05:57.356 --> 05:58.772
resources to help everybody.

05:58.813 --> 06:00.982
That's enough.

06:01.024 --> 06:02.359
I cannot allow my people to be

06:02.360 --> 06:03.693
treated this way anymore.

06:05.486 --> 06:06.968
Redirect funds from

06:06.969 --> 06:08.448
the aqueduct project,

06:08.489 --> 06:09.554
and take care of my people

06:09.555 --> 06:10.617
immediately.

06:10.658 --> 06:12.636
- But, Honor, respectfully, - we
need to keep - The water project...

06:12.660 --> 06:14.370
I have made my decision.

06:15.247 --> 06:16.456
If you'd like to debate it,

06:16.497 --> 06:17.791
you can do so

06:17.792 --> 06:19.084
from the streets,

06:19.126 --> 06:20.752
where you will be personally

06:20.753 --> 06:22.473
- side by side.
- Working with these people,

06:26.758 --> 06:29.385
Ah! Martinian.

06:31.471 --> 06:32.993
- What progress have we made?

06:32.994 --> 06:34.515
- Forgive me.

06:34.557 --> 06:35.809
The inquisitors were

06:35.810 --> 06:37.060
overly zealous

06:37.102 --> 06:38.228
with the old man,

06:38.229 --> 06:39.354
the Christian, Peter.

06:39.395 --> 06:40.521
Zealous?

06:40.563 --> 06:41.877
- He is quite weak.

06:41.878 --> 06:43.191
And?

06:44.985 --> 06:46.069
Honor, he may die.

06:46.111 --> 06:47.195
Excuse me?

06:47.821 --> 06:48.863
He may die.

06:48.905 --> 06:50.782
I seem to recall

06:50.824 --> 06:52.743
giving the specific order

06:52.744 --> 06:54.661
that he may be beaten,

06:54.702 --> 06:58.456
burned, tortured, torn,

06:58.498 --> 07:00.458
twisted in whatever way

07:00.459 --> 07:02.418
that you deemed necessary,

07:03.628 --> 07:05.546
but I clearly remember

07:05.588 --> 07:07.383
that I did not want him

07:07.384 --> 07:09.176
to be killed!

07:09.217 --> 07:11.845
In fact, did I not forbid it?

07:12.679 --> 07:14.264
Yes, Honor.

07:17.267 --> 07:18.373
What am I to do

07:18.374 --> 07:19.477
with a dead man?

07:21.062 --> 07:23.190
It is my fault, Honor.

07:23.231 --> 07:24.565
He is their leader,

07:24.607 --> 07:28.320
and I do not want him dead.

07:30.238 --> 07:31.594
What we have now

07:31.595 --> 07:32.949
is houses burned,

07:33.950 --> 07:34.951
businesses lost,

07:36.619 --> 07:37.683
people in the streets,

07:37.684 --> 07:38.746
homeless,

07:38.788 --> 07:42.542
so what I demand is

07:43.293 --> 07:45.212
that every name

07:47.256 --> 07:49.416
- in starting these fires
- of every Christian involved

07:51.259 --> 07:52.719
Be given to me.

07:53.970 --> 07:56.056
He knows who they are.

08:02.520 --> 08:04.022
And you will give that to me.

08:05.190 --> 08:06.482
Yes, Honor.

08:08.776 --> 08:09.777
Husband.

08:11.279 --> 08:12.468
One of my servants

08:12.469 --> 08:13.656
is an excellent healer.

08:15.367 --> 08:16.660
You can send her

08:16.661 --> 08:17.952
to minister to this Peter.

08:24.500 --> 08:25.626
Bring her.

08:44.938 --> 08:46.564
- Come where
- I can see you.

08:52.153 --> 08:53.196
What is your name?

08:53.821 --> 08:55.073
Susanna.

08:55.115 --> 08:56.929
And why is it I have not

08:56.930 --> 08:58.743
seen you before, Susanna?

08:58.785 --> 08:59.890
She is one of my

08:59.891 --> 09:00.995
personal servants.

09:01.037 --> 09:02.789
She has no reason

09:02.790 --> 09:04.540
to attend at court.

09:04.582 --> 09:05.875
Perhaps in the future,

09:05.876 --> 09:07.516
- to rectify that.
- I should do something

09:15.260 --> 09:16.761
Honor, we have them.

09:16.803 --> 09:17.971
Come on!

09:18.012 --> 09:19.473
Excellent.

09:19.514 --> 09:21.117
Forward. Go!

09:21.141 --> 09:23.559
Martinian, stay for this.

09:38.992 --> 09:39.992
Who am I?

09:43.704 --> 09:44.789
- Do you have a tongue?

09:44.790 --> 09:45.873
Yes, Emperor.

09:50.128 --> 09:52.172
Yes, I am your Emperor,

09:52.213 --> 09:55.425
and you are an arsonist,

09:55.467 --> 09:56.697
a man who likes to set fire

09:56.698 --> 09:57.927
to buildings.

09:57.969 --> 09:59.513
No, Honor.

09:59.554 --> 10:00.952
I do not know who would make

10:00.953 --> 10:02.349
these charges or why.

10:02.390 --> 10:04.851
I have not started any fires.

10:04.892 --> 10:06.060
- Calling me a liar?

10:06.061 --> 10:07.228
- No, Honor.

10:08.271 --> 10:09.814
I understand that you have

10:09.856 --> 10:11.232
spent some time

10:11.233 --> 10:12.608
with the criminal, Peter.

10:13.151 --> 10:14.610
The Christian.

10:17.531 --> 10:19.366
Yes, Honor.

10:19.407 --> 10:20.408
Well, since it's

10:20.409 --> 10:21.409
commonly known

10:21.451 --> 10:22.952
- that Christians
- are responsible

10:22.994 --> 10:26.747
For setting fire to my city,

10:26.789 --> 10:28.020
then you just admitted

10:28.021 --> 10:29.250
to being one of them.

10:29.292 --> 10:30.626
- -But...
- Liar!

10:33.171 --> 10:34.506
Murderer.

10:38.634 --> 10:39.635
Arsonist.

10:43.264 --> 10:44.704
I despise you,

10:44.705 --> 10:46.142
you people of faith.

10:48.395 --> 10:49.750
Now, tell me about

10:49.751 --> 10:51.105
these fires.

10:51.147 --> 10:52.482
Please, Honor.

10:52.483 --> 10:53.816
I've never burned anything,

10:53.858 --> 10:55.131
except a fire to heat my home,

10:55.132 --> 10:56.403
perhaps to cook.

10:56.444 --> 10:57.612
Silence!

10:59.239 --> 11:00.761
Do you have any idea

11:00.762 --> 11:02.283
how many people you've killed?

11:02.325 --> 11:03.493
Do you realize

11:03.494 --> 11:04.660
what you've done?

11:06.329 --> 11:07.414
You Christians,

11:07.415 --> 11:08.498
you're all one,

11:08.540 --> 11:09.708
together like brothers

11:09.709 --> 11:10.875
and sisters, yes?

11:11.543 --> 11:13.669
Yes, Honor.

11:13.711 --> 11:15.755
Well, as I said,

11:15.796 --> 11:17.858
- since we know that
- the Christians are responsible

11:17.882 --> 11:20.260
For burning down the city,

11:20.301 --> 11:21.490
then you just admitted

11:21.491 --> 11:22.678
to being an accessory.

11:23.763 --> 11:24.973
Please, Honor,

11:24.974 --> 11:26.182
I do not understand.

11:26.224 --> 11:28.643
We are a non-violent people.

11:28.684 --> 11:30.353
- We just wish to raise
- our families,

11:30.395 --> 11:31.521
Worship in peace.

11:31.563 --> 11:32.877
Don't say that word,

11:32.878 --> 11:34.190
"worship"!

11:37.860 --> 11:40.322
If there is one thing

11:40.323 --> 11:42.782
I cannot tolerate,

11:42.823 --> 11:44.576
it's a liar.

11:46.202 --> 11:47.203
Honor...

11:59.340 --> 12:01.842
And the rest of them?

12:01.884 --> 12:03.428
Perhaps some time in Mamertine

12:03.429 --> 12:04.971
will get them thinking

12:05.012 --> 12:06.722
- about their response
- in the future.

12:07.557 --> 12:08.600
Yes, Honor.

12:10.101 --> 12:11.978
- Move along.
- Move. Move yourself!

12:13.938 --> 12:14.938
Move!

12:15.773 --> 12:16.773
Keep going.

12:18.985 --> 12:20.463
This is
- longer to the prison

12:20.487 --> 12:21.592
But more peaceful

12:21.593 --> 12:22.697
than city streets.

12:24.198 --> 12:25.950
- Would you care to
- sit for a moment?

12:26.660 --> 12:28.035
Yes, thank you.

12:33.333 --> 12:35.043
I am sorry

12:35.044 --> 12:36.752
you had to witness that.

12:38.879 --> 12:40.111
There's a fine line

12:40.112 --> 12:41.341
between the civility of Rome

12:41.382 --> 12:43.072
and the violence of the men

12:43.073 --> 12:44.760
who would drag her to ruin.

12:46.053 --> 12:47.221
It doesn't bother you?

12:49.807 --> 12:51.017
I spent my career

12:51.018 --> 12:52.226
on the battlefields.

12:53.853 --> 12:55.501
The Gauls to the north,

12:55.502 --> 12:57.148
savages to the east.

12:59.066 --> 13:00.923
They live like beasts,

13:00.924 --> 13:02.778
slaughtering each other,

13:03.988 --> 13:05.073
sometimes even devouring

13:05.074 --> 13:06.157
their enemies.

13:07.992 --> 13:09.744
And you relished in that life?

13:11.078 --> 13:13.331
The Roman army is a line,

13:13.373 --> 13:14.833
the only line between

13:14.834 --> 13:16.292
all of this and savagery.

13:17.544 --> 13:19.546
But that man wasn't a savage.

13:21.047 --> 13:22.340
He was a Roman citizen.

13:22.382 --> 13:25.218
Worse than a savage,

13:25.259 --> 13:26.594
a citizen who turned against

13:26.595 --> 13:27.928
his country.

13:27.970 --> 13:29.701
- And how can you

13:29.702 --> 13:31.450
- It is not mine to question.
- Be so certain?

13:31.474 --> 13:33.059
I leave that to the Emperor.

13:36.229 --> 13:38.356
- Are you feeling well enough
- to walk?

13:39.357 --> 13:40.358
We should go.

13:51.202 --> 13:52.809
I apologize.

13:52.810 --> 13:54.414
These people are like animals.

14:01.879 --> 14:03.399
What have you
- done to him?

14:04.298 --> 14:05.633
How could you?

14:08.428 --> 14:09.763
You are the animals.

14:13.349 --> 14:14.350
Peter?

14:19.188 --> 14:21.316
- Go. Fetch me clean water.

14:23.484 --> 14:24.778
Are you deaf?

14:24.779 --> 14:26.070
Go and fetch me clean water.

14:26.112 --> 14:27.113
Now.

14:29.490 --> 14:30.533
Go on.

14:32.493 --> 14:33.911
Are you all right?

14:38.666 --> 14:39.667
Get out.

14:40.668 --> 14:41.771
- Haven't you done
- enough damage?

14:41.795 --> 14:42.921
Now you wish to stay

14:42.922 --> 14:44.046
and gloat?

14:44.088 --> 14:45.590
I don't want you anywhere

14:45.591 --> 14:47.091
near him.

14:47.133 --> 14:48.884
- Put down the lantern
- and leave.

15:08.613 --> 15:09.905
My name is Susanna.

15:11.616 --> 15:13.243
I'm a servant

15:13.244 --> 15:14.869
to the wife of the Emperor.

15:14.910 --> 15:16.631
- I have been sent
- to tend to your wounds.

15:23.127 --> 15:24.127
Thank you.

15:26.339 --> 15:27.923
Thank you.

15:29.091 --> 15:32.762
This rabbi you follow,

15:32.804 --> 15:34.096
what was he like?

15:45.441 --> 15:46.441
<i>My children.</i>

15:50.070 --> 15:52.071
- I shall only be with you
- a little while longer,

15:53.700 --> 15:55.014
For where I am going,

15:55.015 --> 15:56.327
you cannot follow.

15:58.454 --> 15:59.894
But afterwards,

15:59.895 --> 16:01.332
you will follow me again.

16:04.377 --> 16:05.482
All of you will be made

16:05.483 --> 16:06.587
to stumble this night

16:07.421 --> 16:08.673
because of me.

16:10.717 --> 16:12.927
For it is written,

16:12.968 --> 16:15.471
"I shall strike the shepherd,

16:15.472 --> 16:16.723
shall be scattered."

16:16.724 --> 16:17.973
and his sheep

16:22.812 --> 16:24.104
But when I have risen,

16:25.899 --> 16:26.984
I will go before you

16:26.985 --> 16:28.067
to Galilee.

16:31.362 --> 16:33.615
Even if all others are made

16:33.616 --> 16:35.867
to stumble because of you,

16:35.909 --> 16:36.951
I will never be made

16:36.952 --> 16:37.993
to stumble.

16:40.747 --> 16:45.418
My Peter, I say this to you,

16:45.459 --> 16:47.232
that today, even this night,

16:47.233 --> 16:49.004
before the rooster crows,

16:51.799 --> 16:53.968
you will deny me three times.

16:55.469 --> 16:56.909
If I have to die with you,

16:56.910 --> 16:58.347
I will not deny you.

17:20.578 --> 17:21.997
You also were with

17:21.998 --> 17:23.414
Jesus of Galilee.

17:23.455 --> 17:25.136
- I don't know
- what you're talking about.

17:27.542 --> 17:29.024
<i>What could you
- have done?</i>

17:29.670 --> 17:31.130
You were all alone.

17:32.673 --> 17:34.425
I could've done better.

17:36.886 --> 17:38.763
I should've done better.

17:52.359 --> 17:54.695
I do not understand.

17:54.696 --> 17:57.031
This Peter is a criminal.

17:57.072 --> 17:59.074
You are wrong.

17:59.075 --> 18:01.076
He is a good man,

18:01.118 --> 18:02.265
a holy man who carries

18:02.266 --> 18:03.412
the message of the teacher,

18:06.040 --> 18:07.291
Jesus of Nazareth.

18:09.251 --> 18:11.337
He has committed no crime.

18:11.378 --> 18:13.339
- You should not
- treat him that way.

18:13.380 --> 18:15.404
I am a soldier of Rome

18:15.405 --> 18:17.426
on orders from the Emperor.

18:18.302 --> 18:20.429
And besides,

18:20.471 --> 18:21.681
what of those who died

18:21.682 --> 18:22.890
or were burned out?

18:22.932 --> 18:24.059
These Christians

18:24.060 --> 18:25.184
are criminals,

18:25.225 --> 18:26.352
and it is my duty

18:26.353 --> 18:27.478
to bring them to justice.

18:27.520 --> 18:29.063
Justice?

18:29.104 --> 18:30.418
What about the Christians

18:30.419 --> 18:31.732
who died in the fires?

18:31.774 --> 18:33.651
Why would Peter do that?

18:33.693 --> 18:36.236
Why was he arrested?

18:36.278 --> 18:37.613
Have you even asked yourself

18:37.614 --> 18:38.948
that question?

18:39.907 --> 18:42.242
"A soldier of Rome."

18:42.284 --> 18:43.995
- You should be ashamed
- of yourself.

19:12.940 --> 19:14.734
Husband, here's the girl

19:14.735 --> 19:16.527
to make her report.

19:16.569 --> 19:18.738
Ah! Susanna.

19:18.779 --> 19:20.114
Do you like the harp?

19:20.155 --> 19:21.636
Yes, you play beautifully,

19:21.637 --> 19:23.117
Honor.

19:23.158 --> 19:24.719
- Perhaps I can
- give you some lessons.

19:26.370 --> 19:27.934
Husband, Susanna must leave

19:27.935 --> 19:29.498
for the prison

19:29.540 --> 19:31.084
to tend to Peter.

19:31.125 --> 19:32.189
Yes, she's tending

19:32.190 --> 19:33.252
to my instructions.

19:33.293 --> 19:34.921
But right now,

19:34.922 --> 19:36.547
I need to deal with Theodus,

19:36.589 --> 19:38.298
- who has been waiting
- very patiently.

19:42.762 --> 19:45.098
So what of the Council?

19:46.432 --> 19:47.600
Honor, there...

19:47.641 --> 19:48.768
There is much talk

19:48.769 --> 19:49.894
at the Council.

19:49.936 --> 19:52.105
Isn't that what councils do?

19:52.106 --> 19:54.273
Talk about what?

19:54.314 --> 19:56.442
Perhaps it would be better

19:56.443 --> 19:57.506
in private.

19:57.507 --> 19:58.569
To discuss these matters

19:58.611 --> 20:00.196
Perhaps it would be

20:00.197 --> 20:01.837
- not to keep me waiting.
- Better for you

20:03.449 --> 20:04.489
Of course.

20:06.035 --> 20:08.203
Honor,

20:08.245 --> 20:11.331
Carcinian hints

20:11.373 --> 20:12.500
that the fires were not set

20:12.501 --> 20:13.626
by the Christians.

20:13.667 --> 20:15.316
Yes, he entertains

20:15.317 --> 20:16.963
another theory?

20:17.004 --> 20:18.277
He circulates the idea

20:18.278 --> 20:19.548
that the fires were ordered

20:22.009 --> 20:23.218
by yourself.

20:25.304 --> 20:26.346
By myself?

20:33.187 --> 20:35.607
Now, you see the ability

20:35.608 --> 20:38.025
of these Christians

20:38.067 --> 20:39.402
even to twist the minds

20:39.403 --> 20:40.736
of our good councilors?

20:44.531 --> 20:45.887
Oh, these Christians,

20:45.888 --> 20:47.648
- of the Empire.
- They could be the downfall

20:50.871 --> 20:52.019
But I will not allow this

20:52.020 --> 20:53.166
to continue!

20:55.668 --> 20:57.252
They say they represent a god,

20:58.295 --> 20:59.568
and that god has

20:59.569 --> 21:00.840
attacked my city

21:00.881 --> 21:02.257
and killed my people!

21:03.801 --> 21:05.949
So now, I will become

21:05.950 --> 21:08.097
the chief enemy of that god.

21:10.307 --> 21:11.350
I alone will be

21:11.351 --> 21:12.392
the protector of Rome.

21:13.560 --> 21:14.645
I've had enough

21:14.646 --> 21:15.729
of this hypocrisy.

21:21.777 --> 21:24.530
As for you, young lady,

21:24.571 --> 21:26.281
what have you about Peter?

21:26.323 --> 21:29.035
Your Honor, he is very weak.

21:29.076 --> 21:30.328
I fear another beating

21:30.329 --> 21:31.578
will kill him.

21:31.620 --> 21:32.851
I blame these Christians

21:32.852 --> 21:34.081
for all of this evil

21:34.123 --> 21:36.291
that has befallen upon Rome.

21:39.294 --> 21:40.838
I hereby decree

21:40.839 --> 21:42.381
that from this day forward,

21:42.422 --> 21:43.507
anyone calling themselves

21:43.508 --> 21:44.591
a Christian

21:44.633 --> 21:46.635
will be under arrest.

21:46.677 --> 21:49.346
And you, Captain Martinian,

21:49.388 --> 21:50.535
will be in charge

21:50.536 --> 21:51.682
of their inquisition.

21:51.724 --> 21:52.724
And Peter?

21:53.642 --> 21:55.310
I want him kept alive.

21:56.103 --> 21:58.272
I still have some use for him.

21:59.648 --> 22:01.775
- Perhaps his tongue will loosen
- when he sees

22:01.817 --> 22:03.318
What befalls upon his flock.

22:04.444 --> 22:06.530
You will be sure, Susanna,

22:06.572 --> 22:07.698
that he returns

22:07.699 --> 22:08.824
to good health, yes?

22:08.866 --> 22:10.618
- Yes, Honor.

22:10.619 --> 22:12.369
Excellent.

22:12.411 --> 22:13.788
I want his full confession

22:13.789 --> 22:15.164
before the festival begins.

22:18.500 --> 22:21.670
So that the <i>dies imperil</i>

22:21.712 --> 22:23.881
can mark the renewal of Rome.

22:52.367 --> 22:53.619
You're accused of being

22:53.620 --> 22:54.888
- in the city of Rome
- a Christian

22:54.912 --> 22:56.289
And are hereby under arrest.

23:07.049 --> 23:09.051
You realize this is for you.

23:09.093 --> 23:10.428
Please, I will do anything

23:10.429 --> 23:11.762
you say.

23:11.804 --> 23:13.097
Will you confess?

23:13.139 --> 23:14.681
Anything! Anything you say!

23:18.978 --> 23:22.356
Lord, put compassion

23:22.397 --> 23:23.482
in the hearts

23:23.483 --> 23:24.566
of our tormentors.

23:26.068 --> 23:27.946
Let them see light

23:27.947 --> 23:29.822
from thy wisdom, thy light.

23:31.198 --> 23:32.992
Strengthen us in our weakness.

23:34.201 --> 23:35.911
Deliver us from evil,

23:38.372 --> 23:41.416
for thine is the kingdom

23:46.546 --> 23:48.423
for now and forever.

23:53.762 --> 23:55.430
Oh, this is so wrong.

23:57.350 --> 23:58.911
There's nothing
- to be done.

23:59.518 --> 24:02.855
The Emperor has decreed

24:02.896 --> 24:04.148
that all Christians

24:04.149 --> 24:05.399
are to be arrested.

24:14.616 --> 24:16.176
- No, another cell.
- You.

24:22.833 --> 24:25.460
We have four confessions.

24:25.502 --> 24:26.837
Hmm. Show me a man

24:26.838 --> 24:28.172
who will not confess

24:28.214 --> 24:29.840
when faced with our methods.

24:29.882 --> 24:31.258
Something is wrong?

24:31.300 --> 24:32.740
I did not join the army

24:32.741 --> 24:34.178
to persecute Roman citizens.

24:34.220 --> 24:36.596
I joined to protect them.

24:36.638 --> 24:38.766
Brother, we joined the army

24:38.767 --> 24:40.893
to protect Rome.

24:42.144 --> 24:44.188
We've both bled for her.

24:44.230 --> 24:48.067
I almost died for her.

24:48.108 --> 24:50.090
And these people?

24:50.091 --> 24:52.071
They're the enemies of Rome.

24:52.112 --> 24:53.780
Processus, look at them.

24:56.367 --> 24:57.993
Fathers, mothers,

24:57.994 --> 24:59.619
even children.

25:01.121 --> 25:02.603
Tell me how they qualify

25:02.604 --> 25:04.083
as enemies.

25:04.124 --> 25:05.500
You know as well as I,

25:05.542 --> 25:06.668
orders are determined

25:06.669 --> 25:07.794
by the Emperor.

25:07.836 --> 25:10.256
It is our job to follow them.

25:14.301 --> 25:15.761
There may be another way.

25:16.345 --> 25:17.512
Martinian.

25:34.780 --> 25:35.906
I need a moment.

25:38.451 --> 25:39.534
Alone.

25:49.295 --> 25:50.296
Listen.

25:52.298 --> 25:54.007
Do you hear that, old man?

25:54.674 --> 25:57.386
God hears that.

25:58.971 --> 25:59.972
Well, he may.

26:01.056 --> 26:04.726
You can stop it, all of it.

26:04.768 --> 26:06.479
- You can put an end
- to their misery.

26:11.358 --> 26:12.943
What do you want me to do?

26:14.820 --> 26:15.904
Susanna.

26:17.990 --> 26:19.095
Today is a beautiful day,

26:19.096 --> 26:20.200
isn't it?

26:26.581 --> 26:28.083
I know this must all seem

26:28.084 --> 26:29.584
overwhelming,

26:31.128 --> 26:33.046
but the truth is,

26:33.088 --> 26:34.965
- we must get to the root
- of this evil.

26:36.425 --> 26:37.634
You're living in the palace.

26:37.676 --> 26:38.903
- You've not been
- exposed to the...

26:38.927 --> 26:40.117
How would you know

26:40.118 --> 26:41.305
what I've been exposed to?

26:42.348 --> 26:43.557
I was only suggesting that...

26:43.598 --> 26:45.351
Please do not presume

26:45.392 --> 26:46.498
to know what I do

26:46.499 --> 26:47.602
and do not understand.

26:49.313 --> 26:51.815
All I was trying to say was,

26:51.857 --> 26:53.442
I have a plan,

26:53.484 --> 26:54.794
- one that may save
- many Romans...

26:54.818 --> 26:56.945
A plan based on a lie.

26:56.987 --> 26:58.655
- A lie that may
- save many lives.

26:58.697 --> 26:59.948
At what cost?

27:02.742 --> 27:04.453
I do not understand you.

27:05.329 --> 27:07.456
We are both servants of Rome.

27:08.248 --> 27:10.459
Peter walked with Jesus.

27:12.169 --> 27:13.462
He was the leader

27:13.463 --> 27:14.754
of his Apostles.

27:14.796 --> 27:16.027
Have you not heard a word

27:16.028 --> 27:17.257
he has said?

27:18.717 --> 27:20.135
Why would I even listen?

27:21.428 --> 27:22.910
Perhaps if you did,

27:22.911 --> 27:24.390
you would understand.

27:27.100 --> 27:29.144
Don't!

27:29.186 --> 27:30.250
Since you know me so well,

27:30.251 --> 27:31.313
you also know

27:31.355 --> 27:32.628
I am quite capable

27:32.629 --> 27:33.899
of finding my own way back.

27:53.919 --> 27:54.919
Where's Susanna?

27:56.213 --> 27:57.443
Honor, perhaps she's gone

27:57.444 --> 27:58.673
to attend to your wife.

28:00.717 --> 28:01.717
I see.

28:03.136 --> 28:04.721
Honor, what if

28:04.722 --> 28:06.306
I were to convince

28:06.348 --> 28:08.058
Peter to confess to the fires?

28:09.684 --> 28:11.019
Would that end the persecution

28:11.020 --> 28:12.354
of the Christians?

28:12.396 --> 28:13.877
Your heart has moved

28:13.878 --> 28:15.357
towards their direction.

28:15.399 --> 28:16.567
Do you disagree

28:16.568 --> 28:17.734
with my current methodology?

28:19.027 --> 28:20.027
No, Honor.

28:22.489 --> 28:23.949
There is much work to be done,

28:23.990 --> 28:25.222
and this is a distraction

28:25.223 --> 28:26.452
to my men.

28:27.286 --> 28:28.703
Your advice is wise.

28:28.745 --> 28:30.623
- Achieve it,
- and I will spare them.

28:30.664 --> 28:32.146
But only if

28:32.147 --> 28:33.626
the old man confesses.

28:33.667 --> 28:34.815
I relish the idea of him

28:34.816 --> 28:35.961
begging for mercy.

28:39.298 --> 28:40.299
One more thing.

28:41.967 --> 28:45.178
All of them must deny

28:45.220 --> 28:46.972
this cult of Jesus

28:47.013 --> 28:48.870
as an abomination

28:48.871 --> 28:50.725
against the gods of Rome.

28:51.935 --> 28:53.895
Only then will I spare them.

28:54.771 --> 28:55.771
Honor.

28:57.316 --> 28:59.026
And if he does not do it,

28:59.027 --> 29:00.735
have him flogged.

29:03.029 --> 29:04.781
Forgive me, Honor,

29:04.823 --> 29:06.741
- but you said
- you did not want him to die.

29:08.619 --> 29:09.995
Hmm...

29:10.036 --> 29:12.164
Well, use your imagination.

29:12.165 --> 29:14.291
Come up with something.

29:40.400 --> 29:41.985
- Susanna.

29:41.986 --> 29:43.570
- Yes, mistress.

29:43.612 --> 29:44.973
- Put down that broom.
- Come here.

29:49.576 --> 29:51.411
You are an excellent servant

29:53.539 --> 29:54.914
and very beautiful as well.

29:57.751 --> 29:58.793
Susanna.

30:00.504 --> 30:01.796
This is a man's world.

30:02.881 --> 30:04.383
We women,

30:04.384 --> 30:05.884
we must stick together

30:05.925 --> 30:06.948
no matter

30:06.949 --> 30:07.969
our position in life.

30:08.011 --> 30:09.011
Do you understand?

30:09.763 --> 30:11.181
Yes, mistress.

30:12.182 --> 30:13.622
As you know, my husband,

30:13.623 --> 30:15.060
the Emperor,

30:16.144 --> 30:17.541
he is subject

30:17.542 --> 30:18.938
to various moods.

30:20.357 --> 30:21.942
In the past,

30:21.943 --> 30:23.527
from time to time,

30:23.569 --> 30:25.905
he has been known

30:25.906 --> 30:28.240
to bother the women servants.

30:29.949 --> 30:31.097
Has anything like this

30:31.098 --> 30:32.244
befallen you?

30:32.285 --> 30:33.995
No, mistress.

30:34.037 --> 30:35.268
Are you certain?

30:35.269 --> 30:36.498
You can tell me if it has.

30:36.540 --> 30:38.208
No, mistress, never.

30:38.250 --> 30:40.252
Good.

30:40.293 --> 30:41.942
But you must promise

30:41.943 --> 30:43.589
- if anything happens.
- To let me know

30:44.297 --> 30:45.758
Yes, mistress.

30:47.426 --> 30:49.553
Very well. Back to work.

30:58.729 --> 31:00.502
The Emperor commands that

31:00.503 --> 31:02.274
- to the fires,
- in addition to confessing

31:03.191 --> 31:05.068
You must also deny the Christ.

31:07.862 --> 31:09.864
I will not deny my Lord.

31:11.074 --> 31:12.264
Deny him, and you

31:12.265 --> 31:13.452
will all be spared.

31:14.953 --> 31:16.037
No.

31:22.168 --> 31:23.462
Begin.

32:18.057 --> 32:19.768
Thank you.

32:38.704 --> 32:41.331
Susanna, what are you doing?

32:41.373 --> 32:42.416
Just preparing bandages

32:42.417 --> 32:43.458
for the old man.

32:43.500 --> 32:45.669
And the food?

32:45.711 --> 32:46.941
In case I am not able

32:46.942 --> 32:48.171
to return for lunch.

32:50.256 --> 32:51.758
You spend entirely

32:51.759 --> 32:53.259
too much time at that prison.

32:53.301 --> 32:55.094
I do not know that I like it.

32:55.136 --> 32:57.055
- If you wish, I will ask
- the Emperor to...

32:57.096 --> 32:59.140
No! No.

32:59.850 --> 33:01.852
Continue as ordered,

33:03.102 --> 33:04.167
but return here as quickly

33:04.168 --> 33:05.230
as you can.

33:15.156 --> 33:17.325
<i>- I ask not for myself,
- Lord,</i>

33:17.367 --> 33:18.723
<i>But that you give me</i>

33:18.724 --> 33:20.078
<i>the boldness and the words</i>

33:20.871 --> 33:23.081
to preach thy word.

33:24.791 --> 33:26.543
Let thy will be done, O Lord.

33:27.293 --> 33:28.587
Amen.

33:29.295 --> 33:30.296
Good morning.

33:32.424 --> 33:33.634
Good morning.

33:33.635 --> 33:35.275
- Are feeling better.
- I see you

33:37.345 --> 33:39.076
- You are improving.

33:39.077 --> 33:40.807
- I am. I am.

33:40.849 --> 33:42.308
Why are you not...

33:46.020 --> 33:47.731
How do you deal with this?

33:48.732 --> 33:50.817
I remember him.

33:50.859 --> 33:52.259
<i>Alms for the poor.</i>

33:53.152 --> 33:54.863
Alms for the poor.

33:56.573 --> 33:58.325
Alms for the poor.

33:58.326 --> 34:00.076
Sir, can you help the poor?

34:00.118 --> 34:01.846
- I do not have any silver
- or gold for you.

34:01.870 --> 34:05.081
Please, sir, take pity.

34:05.123 --> 34:06.500
My brother is crippled,

34:06.501 --> 34:07.876
and he cannot walk.

34:07.918 --> 34:11.129
I'll give you what I have.

34:11.170 --> 34:13.110
In the name of Jesus Christ

34:13.110 --> 34:15.049
the Nazarene, get up and walk.

34:36.112 --> 34:37.447
<i>That is incredible.</i>

34:38.156 --> 34:39.574
That was not me.

34:41.074 --> 34:42.639
That was the Holy Spirit

34:42.639 --> 34:44.203
working through me.

34:48.081 --> 34:49.228
You are so blessed

34:49.230 --> 34:50.376
to have spent time with him.

34:51.962 --> 34:54.630
Yes, I was,

34:54.672 --> 34:56.237
and I am blessed

34:56.237 --> 34:57.801
by your visits as well.

34:59.886 --> 35:01.095
You better go now.

35:02.555 --> 35:03.890
You must rest.

35:05.976 --> 35:08.061
Oh.

35:08.102 --> 35:09.354
Rest will make you

35:09.355 --> 35:10.605
strong again.

35:10.647 --> 35:12.607
Rest and the healing power

35:12.608 --> 35:14.567
of the word.

35:20.532 --> 35:21.992
Bless you.

35:42.512 --> 35:43.930
Hello.

35:45.431 --> 35:47.141
Divide it equally.

35:54.607 --> 35:56.568
Why is it that you hate me?

35:58.570 --> 36:01.239
I do not hate you.

36:01.280 --> 36:03.096
I am angry at you

36:03.097 --> 36:05.177
- to a great man like Peter.
- For what you have done

36:06.160 --> 36:07.913
No, you are mistaken.

36:08.705 --> 36:10.832
Nero is a great man.

36:10.874 --> 36:12.521
This Peter, he's a foolish

36:12.522 --> 36:14.168
old storyteller.

36:14.210 --> 36:15.900
You have been gone from Rome

36:15.901 --> 36:17.589
too long.

36:17.630 --> 36:19.445
Our Emperor is a vicious man

36:19.446 --> 36:21.259
who loves no one but himself.

36:22.635 --> 36:23.908
At times, he acts as if

36:23.909 --> 36:25.179
he is a god.

36:25.764 --> 36:27.390
He climbed to power

36:27.432 --> 36:29.768
on the murder of his mother

36:29.769 --> 36:32.104
and his first wife.

36:32.145 --> 36:33.668
He is the most dangerous man

36:33.669 --> 36:35.189
in the civilized world.

36:38.359 --> 36:39.485
How do you know this?

36:40.445 --> 36:43.364
I am a servant of his wife.

36:43.406 --> 36:44.658
I hear everything

36:44.659 --> 36:45.909
that happens in the palace.

36:46.701 --> 36:49.203
No, I don't believe you.

36:51.330 --> 36:53.291
In fact,

36:53.332 --> 36:54.689
I might suspect that you are

36:54.690 --> 36:56.044
a Christian yourself.

36:56.086 --> 36:57.275
- I could have you arrested.

36:57.276 --> 36:58.463
- Go ahead.

36:59.798 --> 37:01.215
I am a Christian.

37:02.884 --> 37:05.303
But know this,

37:05.344 --> 37:07.326
nothing about who I am

37:07.327 --> 37:09.307
changes who Nero is.

37:12.435 --> 37:15.063
Susanna,

37:15.105 --> 37:18.274
your secret is safe with me.

37:28.034 --> 37:30.100
Honor, Heronius has replied.

37:30.101 --> 37:32.164
He looks forward to your games

37:32.205 --> 37:33.811
and will bring five chariots

37:33.812 --> 37:35.416
to compete in your races.

37:41.089 --> 37:42.381
Honor?

37:44.217 --> 37:47.345
Ah! Theodus,

37:47.386 --> 37:49.222
the festival is upon us.

37:49.263 --> 37:50.890
I think I need to do something

37:50.932 --> 37:52.773
- to increase the pressure
- on the Christians.

37:54.102 --> 37:56.062
I'm sorry?

37:56.104 --> 37:57.668
I think I'm going to start

37:57.669 --> 37:59.232
executing some of them.

37:59.273 --> 38:01.025
Not too many. Just a few,

38:01.026 --> 38:02.777
as an example to the rest.

38:02.819 --> 38:04.180
- But it's got to be
- something...

38:06.739 --> 38:08.658
- What do you think
- of wild dogs?

38:10.409 --> 38:11.929
- But, Honor, Rome has not done
- anything...

38:11.953 --> 38:14.768
Theodus, I am Rome.

38:14.769 --> 38:17.583
Rome will do as I wish.

38:17.625 --> 38:19.273
These Christians,

38:19.274 --> 38:20.938
- and dangerous cult.
- They are an extreme

38:20.962 --> 38:22.463
They are a threat to Rome.

38:25.299 --> 38:26.860
- Now, leave me
- while I think on this.

38:32.098 --> 38:33.307
Wait.

38:36.853 --> 38:38.413
- Do you think the palace
- is too dark?

38:40.314 --> 38:42.358
Too dark, Honor?

38:42.400 --> 38:44.256
At night.

38:44.257 --> 38:46.112
Do you think it's too dark?

38:46.154 --> 38:48.156
Trying to find a way

38:48.157 --> 38:49.158
in my gardens,

38:49.159 --> 38:50.159
to create some light

38:50.200 --> 38:51.452
so I can see the beauty

38:51.453 --> 38:52.702
I've created.

39:01.419 --> 39:02.545
I think...

39:04.505 --> 39:06.174
Yes.

39:06.216 --> 39:08.134
- I think we should start
- burning

39:08.176 --> 39:09.761
Some of the Christians,

39:09.802 --> 39:10.929
so I can have some light

39:10.930 --> 39:12.055
for my garden.

39:12.097 --> 39:14.348
Burning Christians?

39:14.390 --> 39:15.663
- But, Honor,

39:15.664 --> 39:17.224
- Theodus.
- They are just people who...

39:18.311 --> 39:19.645
Just a few.

39:20.772 --> 39:21.981
At night.

39:23.816 --> 39:24.901
For the light.

39:28.196 --> 39:29.781
Theodus, go now

39:29.782 --> 39:31.365
and make it so.

39:40.416 --> 39:41.918
It's looking better.

39:43.878 --> 39:45.379
Jesus said to me,

39:46.923 --> 39:50.384
"Peter, you are the rock,

39:50.426 --> 39:51.886
"a rock on which I shall

39:51.887 --> 39:53.346
build my church."

39:55.431 --> 39:57.496
And yet, what have I done

39:57.497 --> 39:59.560
to his flock?

40:00.812 --> 40:02.585
I failed them,

40:02.586 --> 40:04.357
and I failed him.

40:04.398 --> 40:06.985
That is not true.

40:07.026 --> 40:09.216
You bring inspiration,

40:09.217 --> 40:11.405
even while you're here.

40:13.532 --> 40:14.826
You give hope

40:16.119 --> 40:17.578
to me,

40:18.830 --> 40:20.165
to others,

40:22.208 --> 40:23.648
through your stories

40:23.649 --> 40:25.086
and through your faith.

40:29.924 --> 40:31.426
"And a little child

40:31.427 --> 40:32.927
shall lead them."

40:35.972 --> 40:37.431
Thank you.

40:39.017 --> 40:40.393
Thank you.

40:43.355 --> 40:44.897
You must go now.

40:44.939 --> 40:47.651
And if you can, bring me

40:47.652 --> 40:50.362
some parchment.

40:51.070 --> 40:52.655
I need to write.

40:53.531 --> 40:54.573
Of course.

41:10.173 --> 41:11.465
Susanna.

41:14.344 --> 41:15.928
How is Peter today?

41:20.016 --> 41:21.475
He is sad

41:23.186 --> 41:24.354
because of the pain

41:24.355 --> 41:25.521
that he brings to the others.

41:29.650 --> 41:30.881
I have never seen a faith

41:30.882 --> 41:32.111
such as his.

41:33.029 --> 41:35.823
He is old and weak,

41:35.865 --> 41:37.659
yet somehow the stories

41:37.660 --> 41:39.452
he tells, they give him...

41:39.493 --> 41:41.413
- -Strength.
- -Yes.

41:45.083 --> 41:47.002
I have seen no evidence

41:47.003 --> 41:48.920
that he, nor any of them,

41:48.961 --> 41:50.546
are any threat to Rome.

41:50.588 --> 41:52.506
- In fact, I would say
- the opposite.

41:54.008 --> 41:56.282
If all men were to speak

41:56.283 --> 41:58.554
and act as he does,

42:00.056 --> 42:01.974
- I believe Rome would be
- a better place.

42:04.477 --> 42:06.187
Faith is a strange thing.

42:07.980 --> 42:09.107
It inspires even

42:09.108 --> 42:11.360
to open their eyes,

42:11.361 --> 42:12.485
the most hardened

42:12.526 --> 42:14.111
lift their hearts to do

42:14.112 --> 42:15.696
the right thing,

42:16.864 --> 42:18.199
even to love.

42:24.414 --> 42:26.665
I must attend to my duties.

44:37.213 --> 44:39.173
Ah!

44:39.215 --> 44:40.925
- -I brought you a new cloak.
- -Oh...

44:40.966 --> 44:43.469
You must leave

44:43.470 --> 44:45.971
before the guards return.

44:46.013 --> 44:47.953
There is little time.

44:47.954 --> 44:49.892
- To save yourself.
- This is your chance

45:11.080 --> 45:12.080
<i>Abba,</i>

45:13.040 --> 45:16.085
Father,

45:16.127 --> 45:17.232
all things are possible

45:17.233 --> 45:18.337
for you.

45:20.839 --> 45:22.883
Please take this cup from me.

45:29.307 --> 45:32.017
And nevertheless,

45:32.059 --> 45:35.396
not what I will,

45:35.438 --> 45:36.981
but what you will.

45:43.446 --> 45:45.030
<i>I cannot.</i>

45:45.072 --> 45:47.074
What? But you are

45:47.075 --> 45:49.076
too important to die.

45:49.118 --> 45:50.558
What will become of us

45:50.559 --> 45:51.996
if you are gone?

45:52.037 --> 45:56.668
This is the road I must walk.

45:56.709 --> 45:59.004
You were in prison once before

45:59.005 --> 46:01.297
and escaped.

46:01.339 --> 46:03.549
I have heard stories.

46:03.591 --> 46:05.677
And the stories are true.

46:15.269 --> 46:16.938
When I escaped

46:16.939 --> 46:18.606
from Herod's imprisonment,

46:18.648 --> 46:20.024
it was not an act of man

46:20.025 --> 46:21.400
or of woman.

46:22.109 --> 46:23.736
It was an act of God.

46:26.405 --> 46:28.095
I was chained between

46:28.096 --> 46:29.783
two guards,

46:30.951 --> 46:33.621
and the Lord sent an angel

46:35.247 --> 46:38.188
who freed me and opened

46:38.189 --> 46:41.128
the gate and let me out.

46:42.547 --> 46:44.798
It was not I that escaped.

46:46.884 --> 46:48.928
It was God making manifest

46:48.929 --> 46:50.971
His will.

46:54.726 --> 46:56.769
Besides, I have seen

46:56.770 --> 46:58.812
those looks

46:58.854 --> 46:59.980
that you exchange

46:59.981 --> 47:01.106
with Captain Martinian.

47:01.148 --> 47:06.153
Now, if I were to escape

47:06.195 --> 47:08.031
can you imagine

47:08.032 --> 47:09.865
- to these poor jailers?
- What Nero would do

47:10.449 --> 47:12.785
No, my child,

47:12.826 --> 47:14.662
I will put my trust

47:14.663 --> 47:16.497
in the Lord, as should you.

47:26.507 --> 47:27.759
So, my dear,

47:27.760 --> 47:29.009
nothing to report?

47:32.263 --> 47:33.618
- Of my husband.

47:33.619 --> 47:34.973
- No, mistress, nothing.

47:37.769 --> 47:38.811
Things are not well

47:38.812 --> 47:39.853
between us.

47:41.897 --> 47:43.044
I'm afraid he's having

47:43.045 --> 47:44.191
another affair.

47:46.819 --> 47:47.841
I do not know

47:47.842 --> 47:48.862
what I'm going to do.

47:51.073 --> 47:52.658
I'm so sorry, mistress.

47:54.493 --> 47:56.245
He has not spoken

47:56.246 --> 47:57.996
or bothered you?

47:58.038 --> 47:59.038
No, mistress.

48:00.165 --> 48:01.165
Good.

48:02.835 --> 48:05.546
Good.

48:05.588 --> 48:07.695
Last night on the balcony

48:07.696 --> 48:08.749
very emotional.

48:08.750 --> 48:09.801
I noticed you were

48:09.842 --> 48:10.990
Was that prompted

48:10.991 --> 48:12.136
by the music,

48:12.177 --> 48:13.492
or perhaps by the fate

48:13.493 --> 48:14.806
of your fellow believers?

48:16.307 --> 48:17.642
Mistress?

48:17.683 --> 48:18.914
Come, come.

48:18.915 --> 48:20.315
- You're one of them.
- We both know

48:21.520 --> 48:22.709
Friends cannot keep secrets

48:22.710 --> 48:23.897
from one another.

48:25.983 --> 48:27.151
I used to see you praying

48:27.152 --> 48:28.319
all the time.

48:29.361 --> 48:31.029
- After all,
- it was never illegal

48:31.071 --> 48:33.031
To be a Christian in Rome.

48:33.073 --> 48:34.950
That is, until recently.

48:35.827 --> 48:39.204
It is safe here, speak openly.

48:40.372 --> 48:42.541
I do not know what to say.

48:42.583 --> 48:44.376
Have you committed any crime?

48:44.418 --> 48:46.003
No. No, mistress.

48:47.212 --> 48:48.964
Then speak.

48:48.965 --> 48:50.716
No harm will come to you.

48:50.758 --> 48:52.093
- Yes, mistress.

48:52.094 --> 48:53.427
- Yes, what?

48:54.804 --> 48:56.368
Yes, I was upset

48:56.369 --> 48:57.931
at the burning.

49:00.017 --> 49:01.853
Of course you were.

49:01.854 --> 49:03.688
What a horrid affair.

49:03.729 --> 49:04.897
I know not why

49:04.898 --> 49:06.064
my husband's taken

49:06.106 --> 49:07.900
- with such hatred
- towards you people.

49:09.151 --> 49:10.820
Prison, torture.

49:12.946 --> 49:14.406
Mistress?

49:15.282 --> 49:16.282
Speak.

49:18.076 --> 49:19.953
- Do you think you could speak
- with him?

49:20.788 --> 49:22.331
The Emperor, I mean.

49:23.582 --> 49:24.771
Ask him to reconsider

49:24.772 --> 49:25.959
about the old man?

49:26.794 --> 49:28.420
About Peter.

49:32.550 --> 49:35.052
Why, yes, my dear.

49:35.093 --> 49:36.471
Let me find the right moment

49:36.472 --> 49:37.847
to ply his ear.

49:56.615 --> 49:57.742
Have you lost your mind?

49:58.659 --> 50:00.077
What are you talking about?

50:00.118 --> 50:01.266
With Peter, trying to aid

50:01.267 --> 50:02.413
in his escape.

50:04.039 --> 50:05.541
- Processus was just
- down the hall.

50:05.583 --> 50:06.876
He heard everything.

50:06.918 --> 50:08.359
- You're lucky
- he came to me first.

50:09.503 --> 50:11.046
Why doesn't he turn me in?

50:12.381 --> 50:14.195
Because he is my friend,

50:14.196 --> 50:16.009
perhaps my only friend.

50:17.636 --> 50:19.972
That is no reason.

50:20.013 --> 50:21.515
Because he knows

50:21.516 --> 50:23.016
how I feel towards you.

50:27.772 --> 50:31.567
Martinian, please,

50:31.609 --> 50:34.278
I cannot let him die in there.

50:34.319 --> 50:35.738
I understand,

50:35.739 --> 50:37.155
- to be done.
- But there is nothing

50:41.994 --> 50:43.412
What is it?

50:45.163 --> 50:47.040
I spoke to POPPAEA.

50:49.167 --> 50:50.753
Why?

50:50.795 --> 50:53.088
I believe I can trust her.

50:53.130 --> 50:55.090
What if she turns you in?

50:55.132 --> 50:56.592
I am sorry,

50:56.593 --> 50:58.051
but I had to do something.

51:00.512 --> 51:02.055
I must return.

51:08.228 --> 51:09.563
Tiberius.

51:16.695 --> 51:18.572
Captain Martinian.

51:19.865 --> 51:21.347
You care about

51:21.348 --> 51:22.827
these prisoners.

51:22.868 --> 51:24.870
You presume too much, old man.

51:24.912 --> 51:26.039
Oh, I have lived

51:26.040 --> 51:27.164
a long enough life

51:27.205 --> 51:28.540
to recognize concern

51:28.541 --> 51:29.875
when I see it.

51:31.961 --> 51:34.672
And how do you know it is

51:34.673 --> 51:36.028
and not for my duties?

51:36.029 --> 51:37.382
For these prisoners

51:37.424 --> 51:39.426
I was once a young man.

51:43.055 --> 51:44.682
- You were with
- Jesus of Nazareth.

51:44.723 --> 51:45.850
I do not know the man.

51:45.891 --> 51:46.809
- I'm sure that I saw you
- with him.

51:46.851 --> 51:48.101
I do not know him!

51:49.520 --> 51:51.313
<i>I have spent
- the rest of my life</i>

51:51.355 --> 51:52.731
Trying to rise above

51:52.732 --> 51:54.107
that moment,

51:55.275 --> 51:57.820
for what profit a man

51:57.862 --> 51:59.593
that he gain the whole world,

51:59.594 --> 52:01.323
yet lose his soul?

52:06.411 --> 52:08.080
Something is troubling you.

52:10.666 --> 52:12.125
Susanna.

52:13.919 --> 52:15.401
She takes great risks

52:15.402 --> 52:16.881
on your behalf.

52:16.922 --> 52:18.632
I have seen the looks

52:18.674 --> 52:20.300
- that pass between
- the two of you.

52:21.426 --> 52:23.679
I'm concerned for her safety.

52:23.721 --> 52:24.930
And nothing else?

52:27.182 --> 52:28.684
She is enamored

52:28.685 --> 52:30.185
with the rabbi you speak of.

52:31.395 --> 52:35.273
And you are not? Hmm?

52:35.315 --> 52:36.943
It is hard to walk together

52:36.944 --> 52:38.569
- on different paths.
- When you travel

52:40.404 --> 52:41.906
I would like you to look

52:41.907 --> 52:43.407
at these words.

52:44.950 --> 52:47.202
They were inspired by him.

52:48.161 --> 52:50.622
You may find them useful.

53:01.800 --> 53:03.052
Thank you.

53:05.679 --> 53:07.180
God be with you, Captain.

54:49.616 --> 54:50.659
Husband?

55:01.712 --> 55:03.130
My husband,

55:08.135 --> 55:09.887
what troubles weigh on you?

55:12.806 --> 55:14.307
The Jew.

55:15.392 --> 55:16.727
You mean Peter?

55:17.936 --> 55:19.437
And the Senate.

55:21.398 --> 55:22.420
I am no closer

55:22.421 --> 55:23.441
to an accordance

55:23.483 --> 55:24.714
that these Christians

55:24.715 --> 55:25.944
started these fires.

55:29.698 --> 55:31.262
You know, there are those

55:31.263 --> 55:32.826
- release them.
- Who would have you

55:32.868 --> 55:34.327
Traitors.

55:34.995 --> 55:36.329
Who are they?

55:37.622 --> 55:40.542
No one specifically,

55:40.584 --> 55:42.461
but I hear talk

55:42.462 --> 55:44.337
- in the streets,
- in the marketplace,

55:45.380 --> 55:47.299
Even here in the palace.

55:48.341 --> 55:50.219
They say he is a wise

55:50.220 --> 55:52.096
and honest man

55:52.137 --> 55:53.847
who never speaks against Rome.

55:55.015 --> 55:56.183
That he talks only about...

55:56.225 --> 55:57.350
Jesus.

55:59.103 --> 56:00.625
Another rabbi crucified

56:00.626 --> 56:02.147
years ago.

56:04.441 --> 56:06.277
They say he is a holy man

56:06.278 --> 56:08.112
who would not harm anyone.

56:10.488 --> 56:12.365
But I suggest otherwise.

56:13.784 --> 56:15.244
I suggest you further increase

56:15.245 --> 56:16.703
the pressure on him

56:17.704 --> 56:19.581
and on all of the Christians.

56:21.292 --> 56:22.522
And how do you suggest

56:22.523 --> 56:23.752
I do that?

56:29.091 --> 56:31.676
Kill them.

56:31.718 --> 56:33.386
Kill them all.

56:37.182 --> 56:38.830
Perhaps that will gain

56:38.831 --> 56:40.477
his confession.

56:40.518 --> 56:42.083
If not, you eliminate

56:42.084 --> 56:43.647
the root of the problem,

56:43.688 --> 56:44.940
eliminate it

56:44.941 --> 56:46.191
in a very public way.

56:47.943 --> 56:49.695
As they say, "History

56:49.696 --> 56:51.446
is written by the victors."

56:54.741 --> 56:55.909
Go on.

56:57.119 --> 56:59.204
Your games are about to begin.

57:01.081 --> 57:02.812
What better way

57:02.813 --> 57:04.542
to open the festival

57:04.584 --> 57:06.379
than to put all traces

57:06.380 --> 57:08.172
of suspicion behind us?

57:54.885 --> 57:57.513
"Though I speak with

57:57.514 --> 57:58.827
and of angels,

57:58.828 --> 58:00.140
the tongues of men

58:02.851 --> 58:07.147
"have not love, I am nothing."

58:10.275 --> 58:12.674
"And though I understand

58:12.675 --> 58:13.874
and all knowledge,

58:13.875 --> 58:15.072
all mysteries

58:16.781 --> 58:19.451
"and though I have all faith

58:19.492 --> 58:20.556
"so that I may

58:20.557 --> 58:21.619
remove mountains,

58:22.954 --> 58:24.352
"but have not love,

58:24.353 --> 58:25.749
I am nothing."

58:29.961 --> 58:31.422
How do you know these words?

58:32.297 --> 58:34.507
They are the words of Paul.

58:35.508 --> 58:36.509
Paul.

58:37.386 --> 58:41.514
"Love believes all things,

58:41.556 --> 58:43.558
"hopes all things,

58:43.559 --> 58:45.560
endures all things.

58:46.811 --> 58:48.572
- -"Love never fails."
- -"Love never fails."

58:51.775 --> 58:53.110
They are so beautiful.

58:56.029 --> 58:57.822
But how do you know them?

59:00.117 --> 59:02.035
Given to me by Peter

59:04.329 --> 59:06.539
but clearly meant for you.

59:41.741 --> 59:43.160
The morning finds you

59:43.161 --> 59:44.577
- Honor.
- In good spirits.

59:51.918 --> 59:53.586
You've grown fond of him.

59:54.921 --> 59:56.881
I'm sorry, Your Honor?

59:56.923 --> 59:58.091
You think I don't know

59:58.092 --> 59:59.259
about your conversations?

01:00:00.218 --> 01:00:03.138
I have ears everywhere,

01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:04.681
even in Mamertine.

01:00:05.474 --> 01:00:07.017
It's natural.

01:00:07.058 --> 01:00:09.060
When you spend so much time

01:00:09.061 --> 01:00:11.062
with someone, you grow close.

01:00:11.896 --> 01:00:13.690
I understand.

01:00:13.731 --> 01:00:15.233
And he's a very compelling

01:00:15.234 --> 01:00:16.734
storyteller.

01:00:18.611 --> 01:00:20.113
Oh, come on.

01:00:21.198 --> 01:00:24.617
Peter, the rabbi, your friend.

01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:29.414
I know you talk to him.

01:00:32.042 --> 01:00:33.626
Come.

01:00:40.925 --> 01:00:41.968
Kneel.

01:00:52.854 --> 01:00:54.939
Perhaps we could find a way

01:00:54.981 --> 01:00:56.671
that I might consider

01:00:56.672 --> 01:00:58.360
clemency for your friend.

01:00:59.819 --> 01:01:01.654
Honor, your wife...

01:01:01.696 --> 01:01:02.948
Yes, she's at the market

01:01:02.949 --> 01:01:04.199
with her staff.

01:01:05.409 --> 01:01:07.785
Eyes up, girl.

01:01:14.834 --> 01:01:16.211
That's better.

01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:19.005
So do you want clemency

01:01:19.006 --> 01:01:20.340
for your friend?

01:01:21.758 --> 01:01:23.676
- I'd like to consider
- your wishes.

01:01:24.761 --> 01:01:25.762
But, of course,

01:01:25.763 --> 01:01:26.763
it would require

01:01:26.804 --> 01:01:28.244
that you spend far more time

01:01:28.245 --> 01:01:29.682
in my service,

01:01:30.559 --> 01:01:31.851
so to speak.

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:36.064
Does the idea of that to you

01:01:36.106 --> 01:01:39.526
sound appealing?

01:02:20.191 --> 01:02:22.319
Such an innocent thing.

01:02:27.031 --> 01:02:28.031
Susanna!

01:02:29.867 --> 01:02:31.119
Go to the kitchen

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:32.370
and help the others.

01:02:32.412 --> 01:02:33.788
Yes, mistress.

01:02:59.439 --> 01:03:01.358
- I want to thank you
- for your words.

01:03:01.399 --> 01:03:03.694
Oh, they were not my words.

01:03:03.735 --> 01:03:05.153
- They were the words
- of a friend.

01:03:07.405 --> 01:03:08.781
- -Paul.
- -Mmm-hmm.

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:18.791
How do you know? Huh?

01:03:19.584 --> 01:03:22.212
How do you really know

01:03:22.253 --> 01:03:23.588
that this Jesus

01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:25.089
was who he said he was?

01:03:30.428 --> 01:03:32.472
I know that Jesus Christ

01:03:32.514 --> 01:03:35.016
is the son of God

01:03:35.058 --> 01:03:36.476
and my redeemer

01:03:37.810 --> 01:03:40.813
because I saw him

01:03:40.855 --> 01:03:42.940
after he died.

01:03:42.982 --> 01:03:44.901
They crucified him,

01:03:44.902 --> 01:03:46.819
and he rose again.

01:03:48.863 --> 01:03:50.156
And I sat with him.

01:03:50.157 --> 01:03:51.449
I talked with him.

01:03:51.491 --> 01:03:52.825
I even ate with him.

01:03:54.118 --> 01:03:55.412
Uh...

01:03:55.453 --> 01:03:57.830
But I do not understand.

01:04:01.042 --> 01:04:04.379
I am blessed

01:04:04.421 --> 01:04:05.818
because I saw

01:04:05.819 --> 01:04:07.215
the Christ risen.

01:04:08.592 --> 01:04:10.427
But how much more blessed

01:04:10.468 --> 01:04:13.764
are they who did not see

01:04:15.223 --> 01:04:16.683
and yet believe?

01:04:27.110 --> 01:04:28.861
Ah! Susanna.

01:04:29.821 --> 01:04:32.031
Come, come.

01:04:36.286 --> 01:04:38.580
A question.

01:04:38.622 --> 01:04:40.081
Do you think me a fool?

01:04:40.832 --> 01:04:42.793
I'm sorry, Honor?

01:04:42.834 --> 01:04:44.983
In the realm of politics

01:04:44.984 --> 01:04:47.130
and power,

01:04:47.171 --> 01:04:49.882
and rulers and subjects,

01:04:50.675 --> 01:04:53.386
deception and deceit,

01:04:54.387 --> 01:04:55.764
I find it fascinating,

01:04:55.806 --> 01:04:57.808
- how they all work together.
- Don't you?

01:04:59.851 --> 01:05:03.187
Although history has taught us

01:05:03.229 --> 01:05:04.960
that when a ruler

01:05:04.961 --> 01:05:06.691
does not deal swiftly

01:05:06.733 --> 01:05:08.235
with his subjects

01:05:08.236 --> 01:05:09.736
about deception,

01:05:11.822 --> 01:05:12.907
quite often,

01:05:12.908 --> 01:05:13.990
he can find himself

01:05:14.031 --> 01:05:15.575
on the wrong end

01:05:15.617 --> 01:05:17.452
- of the delicate balance
- of his power,

01:05:17.494 --> 01:05:20.163
And that's not good,

01:05:20.204 --> 01:05:21.665
is it?

01:05:23.625 --> 01:05:25.251
So I ask you again.

01:05:29.756 --> 01:05:31.675
Do you think me a fool?

01:05:32.717 --> 01:05:34.260
No, Honor.

01:05:37.388 --> 01:05:40.016
Yet you treat me as one.

01:05:40.725 --> 01:05:42.226
No, Honor.

01:05:51.569 --> 01:05:53.092
Am I given to understand

01:05:53.093 --> 01:05:54.614
that you are much more

01:05:54.656 --> 01:05:55.699
than just good friends

01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:56.741
with this Peter?

01:05:57.450 --> 01:05:59.703
In fact,

01:05:59.744 --> 01:06:01.288
you have become

01:06:01.289 --> 01:06:02.831
one of these followers.

01:06:04.499 --> 01:06:06.459
You have become

01:06:06.501 --> 01:06:08.837
a Christian.

01:06:12.423 --> 01:06:14.092
Yet when we last spoke,

01:06:14.093 --> 01:06:15.760
- to me.
- You failed to mention this

01:06:15.802 --> 01:06:17.054
Is that any way to respect

01:06:17.055 --> 01:06:18.304
your Emperor?

01:06:21.015 --> 01:06:22.433
Answer me!

01:06:23.894 --> 01:06:24.977
Mistress.

01:06:27.772 --> 01:06:29.315
Please.

01:06:29.357 --> 01:06:30.608
I've done nothing wrong.

01:06:30.650 --> 01:06:31.818
My heart belongs to another.

01:06:31.819 --> 01:06:32.985
Please.

01:06:36.197 --> 01:06:37.490
Look at me.

01:06:42.579 --> 01:06:47.333
Are you a Christian?

01:06:55.091 --> 01:06:56.593
What is it that you want

01:06:56.594 --> 01:06:58.094
from me?

01:07:00.471 --> 01:07:02.014
The truth.

01:07:26.873 --> 01:07:28.225
- What are you doing?
- What is this?

01:07:28.249 --> 01:07:29.396
She's admitted to being

01:07:29.397 --> 01:07:30.543
a Christian.

01:07:33.463 --> 01:07:35.006
Susanna?

01:07:35.047 --> 01:07:36.632
Nero has ordered the execution

01:07:36.633 --> 01:07:38.217
of all the Christians,

01:07:38.259 --> 01:07:39.970
including Peter, tomorrow.

01:07:40.011 --> 01:07:41.053
No.

01:07:42.305 --> 01:07:43.848
No, I will not hear it.

01:07:43.849 --> 01:07:45.391
Release her immediately.

01:07:45.433 --> 01:07:46.643
The orders come

01:07:46.644 --> 01:07:47.852
straight from Nero.

01:07:47.894 --> 01:07:49.479
It'll be my head

01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:51.063
if I let her go.

01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:55.339
- I will not allow...

01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:56.527
- Martinian.

01:07:58.529 --> 01:08:00.072
It is not his fault.

01:08:01.783 --> 01:08:03.597
The Emperor asked me

01:08:03.598 --> 01:08:05.411
if I was a Christian,

01:08:05.453 --> 01:08:07.079
and I could not deny my faith.

01:08:09.290 --> 01:08:11.208
There is nothing to be done.

01:08:20.468 --> 01:08:22.094
No, we will see.

01:08:22.761 --> 01:08:24.430
Martinian?

01:08:24.471 --> 01:08:25.598
Lock her up.

01:08:35.024 --> 01:08:36.212
- Martinian.

01:08:36.214 --> 01:08:37.401
- Out of my way, Captain.

01:08:41.948 --> 01:08:44.033
Forgive the intrusion, Honor.

01:08:44.075 --> 01:08:45.598
Yes, Captain, perhaps you've

01:08:45.599 --> 01:08:47.118
brought me a confession.

01:08:49.121 --> 01:08:51.457
Honor, I have come to ask

01:08:51.457 --> 01:08:52.626
Susanna.

01:08:52.627 --> 01:08:53.792
About your servant girl,

01:08:53.835 --> 01:08:55.566
Ah, yes, no doubt

01:08:55.567 --> 01:08:57.296
she's in Mamertine.

01:08:57.337 --> 01:08:59.256
Pretty little flower.

01:08:59.298 --> 01:09:00.676
Perhaps

01:09:00.676 --> 01:09:02.051
there's been some mistake, no?

01:09:02.093 --> 01:09:03.301
I don't believe so.

01:09:03.344 --> 01:09:04.701
Honor, she is a harmless

01:09:04.702 --> 01:09:06.055
servant girl.

01:09:06.096 --> 01:09:07.491
- How is it that
- she is in prison?

01:09:07.515 --> 01:09:09.538
She's a Christian.

01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:11.560
That makes her a criminal.

01:09:13.813 --> 01:09:15.336
Ah, do I sense something more

01:09:15.337 --> 01:09:16.858
- Captain?
- Than a dutiful question,

01:09:17.567 --> 01:09:19.569
I only wish

01:09:19.609 --> 01:09:22.654
that you would consider...

01:09:22.697 --> 01:09:24.573
Of course,

01:09:24.575 --> 01:09:26.450
- around these charges.
- I offered her a way

01:09:26.492 --> 01:09:28.745
A way, shall we say,

01:09:28.786 --> 01:09:29.912
shouldn't be discussed

01:09:29.953 --> 01:09:31.102
amongst polite company

01:09:31.103 --> 01:09:32.247
or open court.

01:09:33.499 --> 01:09:35.167
She refused.

01:09:35.209 --> 01:09:36.752
It is only now

01:09:36.752 --> 01:09:38.295
- what she meant
- that I understand

01:09:38.337 --> 01:09:39.756
When she said

01:09:39.756 --> 01:09:41.173
her heart belonged to another.

01:09:42.508 --> 01:09:45.095
I appeal to your compassion.

01:09:45.136 --> 01:09:47.096
No, you cannot, Captain.

01:09:47.098 --> 01:09:49.057
The law is the law.

01:09:49.099 --> 01:09:50.140
Who am I to change

01:09:50.142 --> 01:09:51.183
my own edicts?

01:09:55.105 --> 01:09:56.669
You're a passionate man.

01:09:56.670 --> 01:09:58.232
I like that.

01:09:59.525 --> 01:10:00.735
May I counsel you

01:10:00.777 --> 01:10:02.029
that you shouldn't throw away

01:10:02.030 --> 01:10:03.279
your entire career

01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:04.739
over some pretty little

01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:06.157
Christian servant girl

01:10:06.198 --> 01:10:08.200
who was pleasing to the eye.

01:10:09.577 --> 01:10:11.892
Ma'am,

01:10:11.893 --> 01:10:14.206
she is your faithful servant.

01:10:14.248 --> 01:10:15.434
- Surely, you would
- not let her die

01:10:15.458 --> 01:10:17.460
For such a pointless offense.

01:10:17.501 --> 01:10:19.045
You mistake

01:10:19.046 --> 01:10:20.588
my wife's loyalty, Captain.

01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:22.423
In fact, it was my wife

01:10:22.424 --> 01:10:24.216
- servant's treachery.
- Who told me of this

01:10:26.385 --> 01:10:27.616
My love, do you wish this girl

01:10:27.617 --> 01:10:28.846
to be back in your service?

01:10:29.889 --> 01:10:31.766
No, husband.

01:10:31.808 --> 01:10:33.518
Ah, well,

01:10:33.519 --> 01:10:35.227
it's decided then.

01:10:35.269 --> 01:10:37.210
Now, Captain,

01:10:37.211 --> 01:10:39.149
I have some orders for you.

01:10:39.190 --> 01:10:40.984
Tomorrow, you will

01:10:40.985 --> 01:10:42.777
personally be in charge

01:10:42.819 --> 01:10:45.113
of the execution of Peter

01:10:45.155 --> 01:10:46.698
and all the Christians

01:10:46.699 --> 01:10:48.240
in prison.

01:10:48.282 --> 01:10:49.826
Won't this be a wonderful way

01:10:49.867 --> 01:10:51.548
- to start off the greatest
- banquet ever?

01:10:53.204 --> 01:10:55.165
You are dismissed.

01:10:55.206 --> 01:10:57.500
No, Honor,

01:10:57.541 --> 01:10:58.793
I cannot carry out

01:10:58.794 --> 01:11:00.044
those orders.

01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:04.090
You realize,

01:11:04.091 --> 01:11:05.549
- it is treason.
- If you disobey me,

01:11:05.591 --> 01:11:07.426
I do.

01:11:08.427 --> 01:11:10.096
Then you will obey.

01:11:10.138 --> 01:11:12.182
Forgive me, Honor.

01:11:13.224 --> 01:11:14.830
But I cannot carry out

01:11:14.831 --> 01:11:16.435
your orders.

01:11:16.477 --> 01:11:18.271
And I cannot have a traitor

01:11:18.272 --> 01:11:20.064
in my army.

01:11:20.106 --> 01:11:21.379
I warn you for the last time,

01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:22.650
Captain.

01:11:22.692 --> 01:11:24.027
If you disobey me,

01:11:24.068 --> 01:11:26.029
- you will die
- with the rest of them.

01:11:27.905 --> 01:11:29.281
So be it.

01:11:30.366 --> 01:11:31.993
Get this man out of my sight.

01:11:44.047 --> 01:11:46.549
Perhaps this is not wise.

01:11:48.176 --> 01:11:49.239
I mean, mixing him

01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:50.302
in with the Christians.

01:11:51.512 --> 01:11:53.055
How can you execute them

01:11:53.056 --> 01:11:54.598
if Martinian,

01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:56.142
one of your most trusted

01:11:56.143 --> 01:11:57.643
officers, stands with them?

01:11:57.685 --> 01:11:59.437
How will this look

01:11:59.438 --> 01:12:01.189
to the Council, to the Senate?

01:12:01.231 --> 01:12:02.899
Forget the Senate.

01:12:04.901 --> 01:12:06.318
He will come back around.

01:12:07.237 --> 01:12:08.571
She's right, Honor.

01:12:08.612 --> 01:12:10.507
- This will not give
- the appearance of strength.

01:12:10.531 --> 01:12:11.762
Martinian is a

01:12:11.763 --> 01:12:12.992
professional soldier.

01:12:14.368 --> 01:12:15.745
He has always been

01:12:15.746 --> 01:12:17.121
a soldier of Rome.

01:12:17.163 --> 01:12:19.478
He has been a personal soldier

01:12:19.479 --> 01:12:21.792
for me in my army.

01:12:21.834 --> 01:12:23.795
All he has ever known

01:12:23.796 --> 01:12:25.755
is to be of service to me.

01:12:25.796 --> 01:12:27.569
He simply got his

01:12:27.570 --> 01:12:29.410
- by a pretty little girl.
- Head turned around

01:12:31.177 --> 01:12:32.804
- He will be fine.

01:12:32.805 --> 01:12:34.430
What if he is not?

01:12:34.471 --> 01:12:37.058
You cannot execute him.

01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:38.685
Or the girl, for that matter.

01:12:38.686 --> 01:12:40.287
- In the palace.
- She lived here with you

01:12:40.311 --> 01:12:41.354
How will it look

01:12:41.355 --> 01:12:42.396
if your own staff rebel?

01:12:42.438 --> 01:12:44.065
All I'm saying is,

01:12:44.107 --> 01:12:45.337
we do not want to make martyrs

01:12:45.338 --> 01:12:46.567
of these people.

01:12:49.403 --> 01:12:51.363
He will not disobey me.

01:12:52.073 --> 01:12:55.367
He cannot disobey me.

01:12:56.869 --> 01:12:59.289
I am his Emperor.

01:12:59.330 --> 01:13:01.373
The ruler of Rome.

01:13:08.589 --> 01:13:11.842
Please, let's talk about this.

01:13:11.884 --> 01:13:13.698
- You've been talking

01:13:13.699 --> 01:13:15.512
- But you have not.
- All the way here.

01:13:15.554 --> 01:13:17.535
You think about

01:13:17.536 --> 01:13:19.516
what you're doing.

01:13:19.558 --> 01:13:22.979
You think about your career.

01:13:24.730 --> 01:13:26.857
- I believe this has gone beyond
- career, my friend.

01:13:26.899 --> 01:13:28.400
No, it hasn't.

01:13:31.028 --> 01:13:33.135
We spent our lives

01:13:33.136 --> 01:13:35.241
defending the Empire.

01:13:35.283 --> 01:13:36.785
Why throw that away?

01:13:36.786 --> 01:13:38.286
Over what?

01:13:40.246 --> 01:13:41.747
Over what?

01:13:44.583 --> 01:13:46.752
Over truth, over honesty,

01:13:46.753 --> 01:13:48.921
over freedom.

01:13:52.133 --> 01:13:53.134
The whims of one man

01:13:53.135 --> 01:13:54.135
will not dictate

01:13:54.177 --> 01:13:55.886
the course of this world.

01:13:57.263 --> 01:14:02.226
No, he is wrong. I know it.

01:14:02.268 --> 01:14:03.353
And somewhere in there,

01:14:03.354 --> 01:14:04.436
you know it as well.

01:14:10.276 --> 01:14:11.568
What is going on here?

01:14:11.610 --> 01:14:13.258
Martinian's disobeyed

01:14:13.259 --> 01:14:14.905
the Emperor.

01:14:14.947 --> 01:14:16.344
He's been ordered

01:14:16.345 --> 01:14:17.759
- you lot in the morning.
- To be executed with

01:14:17.783 --> 01:14:21.620
No. No, that can't be true.

01:14:21.662 --> 01:14:23.998
I was ordered to execute you,

01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:28.127
all of you, but I refused.

01:14:28.169 --> 01:14:29.609
I will not be a part

01:14:29.610 --> 01:14:31.064
- you harm.
- Of something that brings

01:14:31.088 --> 01:14:32.589
There must be some way.

01:14:32.631 --> 01:14:33.883
I'm afraid not, miss.

01:14:33.924 --> 01:14:35.634
- Not unless
- you're willing to recant.

01:14:35.676 --> 01:14:38.221
Do not ask that of her.

01:14:38.262 --> 01:14:39.868
Then I'm sorry.

01:14:39.869 --> 01:14:41.473
There is no other choice.

01:14:51.275 --> 01:14:53.090
If Susanna and Peter

01:14:53.091 --> 01:14:54.904
are criminals, then so am I.

01:14:56.822 --> 01:14:58.366
It is their last night,

01:14:58.367 --> 01:14:59.909
I would spend it with them.

01:14:59.950 --> 01:15:01.952
Unlock the doors and leave us.

01:15:04.705 --> 01:15:06.102
I give you my word,

01:15:06.103 --> 01:15:07.499
I will not aid in an escape.

01:15:30.106 --> 01:15:31.774
Leave them.

01:15:55.381 --> 01:15:57.405
I am so sorry that you are

01:15:57.406 --> 01:15:59.427
involved in all of this.

01:15:59.469 --> 01:16:01.471
No, it is not your fault.

01:16:01.512 --> 01:16:03.035
- I never expected...

01:16:03.036 --> 01:16:04.556
- No. No, you were right.

01:16:05.724 --> 01:16:07.559
The Emperor is a madman.

01:16:09.479 --> 01:16:10.605
I cannot believe Rome

01:16:10.606 --> 01:16:11.730
has fallen to this.

01:16:12.982 --> 01:16:14.651
None of it.

01:16:14.652 --> 01:16:16.319
None of this was necessary.

01:16:17.361 --> 01:16:18.821
How can you have such faith

01:16:18.862 --> 01:16:20.223
- when surrounded
- by all of this?

01:16:21.031 --> 01:16:22.616
Because I believe.

01:16:27.163 --> 01:16:28.580
And you are certain?

01:16:35.463 --> 01:16:38.841
I put my trust

01:16:38.882 --> 01:16:41.302
in the Lord Jesus Christ.

01:16:59.028 --> 01:17:01.738
I baptize you

01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:05.617
in the name of Jesus Christ.

01:17:15.336 --> 01:17:16.837
Arise.

01:18:07.597 --> 01:18:10.558
Please, I cannot do this.

01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:12.456
I deny him. I deny my faith.

01:18:12.457 --> 01:18:14.311
I'm sorry. I deny.

01:18:14.353 --> 01:18:16.105
- Anyone else?

01:18:16.106 --> 01:18:17.856
- I recant. Please.
- Please, I'm sorry.

01:18:17.898 --> 01:18:19.233
- -Just let me go.
- -Free them.

01:18:48.304 --> 01:18:49.639
You take this and go.

01:18:53.809 --> 01:18:54.935
Why are you doing this?

01:18:56.312 --> 01:18:59.565
Because, like you,

01:18:59.607 --> 01:19:01.358
I believe his words.

01:19:21.128 --> 01:19:23.964
Go now, and live in Christ.

01:19:24.006 --> 01:19:25.508
And bear witness.

01:19:25.549 --> 01:19:27.134
- No... Peter!
- -Go.

01:19:27.176 --> 01:19:28.760
- Arrest him.
- Peter!

01:19:40.856 --> 01:19:42.128
Good Heronius,

01:19:42.129 --> 01:19:43.400
five chariots.

01:19:43.442 --> 01:19:44.652
- You spared no expense.

01:19:44.653 --> 01:19:45.861
- Hmm.

01:19:45.902 --> 01:19:47.050
So happy you could join me

01:19:47.051 --> 01:19:48.197
for the pre-festivities.

01:19:48.238 --> 01:19:49.449
Truly my very great pleasure,

01:19:49.450 --> 01:19:50.658
Honor.

01:19:51.825 --> 01:19:53.285
Who is this Peter

01:19:53.286 --> 01:19:54.745
I'm hearing about?

01:19:54.786 --> 01:19:56.100
One of the leaders

01:19:56.101 --> 01:19:57.414
of this cult.

01:19:57.456 --> 01:19:58.686
I understand this movement

01:19:58.687 --> 01:19:59.916
is growing.

01:19:59.958 --> 01:20:01.169
Do you really intend

01:20:01.170 --> 01:20:02.378
to execute him?

01:20:02.419 --> 01:20:03.838
Not if he recants the errors

01:20:03.839 --> 01:20:05.255
of his ways.

01:20:05.297 --> 01:20:06.798
And if he fails to do so?

01:20:07.466 --> 01:20:08.925
He will not.

01:20:17.393 --> 01:20:18.810
Nero!

01:20:24.191 --> 01:20:26.005
Stop them!

01:20:26.006 --> 01:20:27.819
Stop them! Stop them!

01:20:29.697 --> 01:20:30.906
Stop!

01:20:30.907 --> 01:20:32.747
- Name of the Emperor!
- Stop in the

01:21:02.979 --> 01:21:04.523
How did they escape?

01:21:04.524 --> 01:21:06.066
- I let them go.

01:21:06.108 --> 01:21:08.027
- You what?

01:21:08.028 --> 01:21:09.945
- To Rome, to you.
- Martinian was faithful

01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:12.802
He did nothing wrong.

01:21:12.803 --> 01:21:14.324
Nothing, except...

01:21:32.926 --> 01:21:35.178
You're with courage now.

01:21:35.220 --> 01:21:37.265
You will be with the Lord

01:21:37.266 --> 01:21:39.308
in heaven tonight.

01:21:42.352 --> 01:21:43.813
Get him up.

01:21:51.194 --> 01:21:52.571
Old man,

01:21:53.530 --> 01:21:55.783
it seems as though your way

01:21:55.825 --> 01:21:56.867
has spread like a poison

01:21:56.868 --> 01:21:57.909
amongst your people.

01:21:59.369 --> 01:22:00.663
What do you say?

01:22:01.497 --> 01:22:02.914
I bring no poison.

01:22:04.541 --> 01:22:06.877
I bring a message of faith.

01:22:06.918 --> 01:22:08.521
- Well, then your faith
- has led your people

01:22:08.545 --> 01:22:09.880
To become enemies of Rome.

01:22:09.921 --> 01:22:12.800
You know that is not true.

01:22:12.842 --> 01:22:14.217
Do you dare presume...

01:22:14.259 --> 01:22:16.845
Sir, those are Roman citizens

01:22:16.846 --> 01:22:19.431
that you persecute.

01:22:19.473 --> 01:22:22.267
They have committed no crimes,

01:22:22.309 --> 01:22:24.374
and yet you arrest them

01:22:24.375 --> 01:22:25.407
and torture...

01:22:25.408 --> 01:22:26.438
and imprison them

01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:27.981
I say they're criminals,

01:22:28.023 --> 01:22:29.608
and therefore

01:22:29.609 --> 01:22:31.193
they are criminals,

01:22:32.944 --> 01:22:35.989
so mind your tongue,

01:22:36.031 --> 01:22:38.241
and answer my charge.

01:22:38.283 --> 01:22:39.702
I came to Rome

01:22:39.703 --> 01:22:41.120
of Jesus Christ.

01:22:41.121 --> 01:22:43.955
To preach the Gospel

01:22:45.207 --> 01:22:48.251
It is a message of love

01:22:48.293 --> 01:22:49.774
and forgiveness

01:22:49.775 --> 01:22:51.254
and redemption.

01:22:51.296 --> 01:22:52.652
It is for all men

01:22:52.653 --> 01:22:54.007
and all women.

01:22:55.551 --> 01:22:57.344
Even for you.

01:23:01.139 --> 01:23:03.308
Did you all hear that?

01:23:04.976 --> 01:23:06.770
Even for me.

01:23:10.023 --> 01:23:11.296
You have the audacity

01:23:11.297 --> 01:23:12.568
to suggest

01:23:12.609 --> 01:23:14.277
that I need forgiveness.

01:23:15.195 --> 01:23:17.823
For what? And from whom?

01:23:17.865 --> 01:23:19.241
A dead carpenter?

01:23:19.282 --> 01:23:21.993
He is not dead. He is risen.

01:23:23.286 --> 01:23:26.832
Christ is risen,

01:23:26.874 --> 01:23:29.000
- and he sits at the right hand
- of God!

01:23:30.419 --> 01:23:31.754
Blasphemy!

01:23:33.839 --> 01:23:36.592
There is no name above Nero.

01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:40.053
This is my empire.

01:23:41.931 --> 01:23:44.433
I am the god of Rome.

01:23:44.474 --> 01:23:47.895
You are the Emperor of Rome,

01:23:49.939 --> 01:23:51.815
but you are no god.

01:23:53.149 --> 01:23:54.735
You are a man.

01:23:54.777 --> 01:23:56.027
Enough!

01:23:59.030 --> 01:24:00.657
Today is my feast,

01:24:01.992 --> 01:24:03.953
and even you, a heretic,

01:24:03.954 --> 01:24:05.913
could receive a pardon.

01:24:07.330 --> 01:24:09.332
All you have to do

01:24:09.333 --> 01:24:11.334
is confess your crimes,

01:24:11.376 --> 01:24:13.044
admit to your heresy,

01:24:14.212 --> 01:24:16.047
and renounce your faith.

01:24:17.215 --> 01:24:20.761
Then, I will set you free.

01:24:22.805 --> 01:24:26.308
The truth has set me free.

01:24:27.810 --> 01:24:30.312
Let it set you free.

01:24:30.353 --> 01:24:32.794
I offer you

01:24:32.795 --> 01:24:35.233
the gift of salvation.

01:24:35.275 --> 01:24:37.173
Even your Jesus

01:24:37.174 --> 01:24:39.070
- not here, not today.
- Could not save you,

01:24:41.907 --> 01:24:44.785
If you want to find freedom,

01:24:44.827 --> 01:24:45.953
you will have to find it

01:24:45.954 --> 01:24:47.078
through me.

01:24:52.709 --> 01:24:56.087
All flesh is as grass.

01:24:56.922 --> 01:24:59.633
All glory is as a flower.

01:25:02.093 --> 01:25:03.428
Grass withers.

01:25:05.263 --> 01:25:07.057
A flower falls away.

01:25:09.225 --> 01:25:11.353
But the word of the Lord

01:25:11.354 --> 01:25:13.480
will endure forever.

01:25:15.691 --> 01:25:16.796
You realize

01:25:16.797 --> 01:25:17.901
like that dog.

01:25:17.902 --> 01:25:20.111
You will not die quickly

01:25:22.405 --> 01:25:24.115
You will be crucified.

01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:31.353
I will not fail you

01:25:31.354 --> 01:25:32.624
this time, Lord.

01:25:36.670 --> 01:25:39.089
If I am to be crucified,

01:25:40.590 --> 01:25:42.133
I beg a favor.

01:25:44.053 --> 01:25:45.596
That I may be crucified

01:25:45.597 --> 01:25:47.138
upside down,

01:25:49.808 --> 01:25:51.518
for I am not worthy

01:25:53.645 --> 01:25:55.710
to die in the same manner

01:25:55.711 --> 01:25:57.774
as my Lord.

01:26:02.112 --> 01:26:04.344
I will grant your request,

01:26:04.345 --> 01:26:06.575
as I am a merciful man.

01:26:09.036 --> 01:26:10.245
Always good to have

01:26:10.246 --> 01:26:11.454
a little variety.

01:26:43.153 --> 01:26:46.990
"Our Father who art in heaven

01:26:48.199 --> 01:26:50.493
"Hallowed be thy name

01:26:52.495 --> 01:26:56.666
"Thy kingdom come...

01:26:56.708 --> 01:27:00.378
"Thy will be done

01:27:02.255 --> 01:27:05.134
"On Earth as it is in heaven"
