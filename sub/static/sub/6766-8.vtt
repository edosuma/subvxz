00:01.867 --> 00:03.529

00:18.918 --> 00:20.545
Hey, happy Halloween.

00:20.587 --> 00:21.986
Ray, what are you doing?

00:22.022 --> 00:24.513
Bringing you your, uh,
anniversary present.

00:24.557 --> 00:26.491
It's not our anniversary.

00:26.526 --> 00:27.925
What are you talking about?
Of course it is.

00:30.296 --> 00:32.764
I mean... I mean,
we have nothing to celebrate.

00:32.799 --> 00:34.767
Well, sure we do.

00:34.801 --> 00:36.428
It's, um... It's a...

00:36.469 --> 00:38.266
It's a new year, new beginning.

00:38.304 --> 00:41.364
And this time,
we're gonna get it right.

00:41.408 --> 00:43.376
I got it right the first time.

00:44.744 --> 00:47.144
Well, hey, are you gonna go

00:47.180 --> 00:49.978
to that Halloween party
tonight at the After Dark?

00:50.016 --> 00:51.540
Yeah.

00:51.584 --> 00:53.017
Yeah, I am.

00:53.086 --> 00:55.020
- Need a ride?
- Ray.

00:55.121 --> 00:58.352
Hey, you can't blame a guy
for trying, right?

00:58.391 --> 00:59.858
I am trying, Donna.

01:04.030 --> 01:05.793
I know you are.

01:05.832 --> 01:07.322
So, look, um,

01:07.367 --> 01:09.767
I'll be there tonight
if you want to talk

01:09.803 --> 01:11.703
or maybe even dance.

01:11.738 --> 01:13.103
We'll see.

01:16.476 --> 01:18.706
Hey, Donna?

01:18.745 --> 01:20.007
Happy anniversary.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.950
I woke up this morning,

02:34.988 --> 02:36.387
and my baby was gone.

02:36.422 --> 02:37.855
Your baby was on a mission.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.153
Well, what was she getting?

02:39.192 --> 02:41.752
I thought... I thought
you were gonna get, like, milk.

02:41.794 --> 02:44.092
I was expecting milk,
bread, you know, butter.

02:44.130 --> 02:45.927
Have we forgotten
what day it is?

02:45.965 --> 02:48.331
We have trick-or-treaters
to entertain tonight.

02:48.368 --> 02:49.733
Entertain?

02:49.769 --> 02:50.929
I mean, look,
usually on Halloween,

02:50.970 --> 02:52.733
I-I pull the curtains,
I sit here in the dark

02:52.772 --> 02:54.865
with a rocket launcher
on my lap, and it works for me.

02:54.908 --> 02:56.432
Charming, but now
that we're roommates,

02:56.476 --> 02:57.738
everything's going
to be different.

02:57.777 --> 02:59.244
No hiding out, no brooding.

02:59.279 --> 03:01.873
Like it or not,
you're going to join the living.

03:01.915 --> 03:03.246
Right. So what are we gonna do

03:03.283 --> 03:05.217
with young David Silver here,
put it in my closet?

03:05.251 --> 03:06.809
Front door.

03:11.224 --> 03:13.658
Oh, look out, look out. Trouble.

03:13.693 --> 03:15.456
Oh, what do you mean, trouble?

03:15.495 --> 03:16.689
She's adorable.

03:16.729 --> 03:17.957
Come here, little girl.

03:17.997 --> 03:20.295
Nah... No, don't do that.

03:20.333 --> 03:21.561
Come here.

03:21.601 --> 03:23.569
The last thing I need
right now is a black cat.

03:23.603 --> 03:24.831
- That is bad luck.
- Don't be superstitious.

03:24.871 --> 03:26.236
Look, she's the perfect
Halloween pet. Oh.

03:26.272 --> 03:28.297
Yeah, perfect Halloween...
fleas and stuff.

03:28.341 --> 03:30.241
Hey. We can fix that.

03:30.276 --> 03:31.300
Oh, come here, little kitty.

03:31.344 --> 03:33.175
Did I ever tell you
how I hate pets?

03:33.213 --> 03:34.339
Come here, baby.

03:34.380 --> 03:35.642
Well, you don't anymore. No.

03:35.682 --> 03:37.081
Hello.

03:37.116 --> 03:38.640
I know we talked about it.

03:38.685 --> 03:40.482
You know I hate them.

04:03.910 --> 04:06.504
Tarot answers the question
that's most important

04:06.546 --> 04:08.844
to you right now,
based on your past,

04:08.881 --> 04:10.712
your present and your future.

04:10.750 --> 04:11.944
So, in other words,

04:12.051 --> 04:13.382
these cards are telling you

04:13.419 --> 04:15.944
that you're incredibly kind,
generous and gifted.

04:16.055 --> 04:17.750
It goes much deeper than that.

04:17.790 --> 04:19.120
Hmm.

04:19.158 --> 04:20.420
Oh, incredibly kind, gifted,

04:20.459 --> 04:22.155
generous, pretty
and smart, right?

04:23.363 --> 04:24.694
Laugh all you want, guys,

04:24.731 --> 04:25.959
but I think
there's some truth here.

04:25.999 --> 04:28.934
Like this last card...
my significator.

04:28.968 --> 04:30.492
This one applies directly to me.

04:30.536 --> 04:32.163
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

04:33.740 --> 04:35.105
Lovers.

04:35.141 --> 04:37.268
I thought you said nothing
happened between you and Steve?

04:37.310 --> 04:39.175
- Nothing did.
- Well, it looks like

04:39.212 --> 04:40.440
something will.

04:40.480 --> 04:42.607
I mean, it's in the cards.

04:42.649 --> 04:44.480
- Woo
- Woo!

04:44.517 --> 04:47.145
Come on, Clare, we're
gonna be late for school.

04:47.186 --> 04:50.485
So, are you standing me up
for the party?

04:50.523 --> 04:52.616
No. I just want to meet
you there, that's all.

04:52.659 --> 04:54.559
- But I thought we had a date.
- We do.

04:54.594 --> 04:57.461
I just want my costume to
be a surprise, that's all.

04:57.497 --> 04:59.692
Come on, give me a little hint.

04:59.732 --> 05:01.597
Okay.

05:01.634 --> 05:03.033
It's very feminist.

05:04.270 --> 05:05.897
You... a feminist?

05:05.938 --> 05:07.098
Shocker.

05:07.140 --> 05:10.132
Let me guess...
you're going as yourself?

05:10.176 --> 05:12.076
Cheeseburger, French fries,

05:12.111 --> 05:14.045
Chili dogs, two
steak sandwiches.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.206
This guy's incredible.

05:15.248 --> 05:16.374
The guy's a vacuum cleaner.

05:16.416 --> 05:18.043
How often does he do this?

05:18.084 --> 05:19.915
- Tuesday and Thursday
before every game. - Hey.

05:19.952 --> 05:21.283
- What's up, Steve?
- How are you?

05:21.321 --> 05:22.583
Donna Martin, this is my buddy

05:22.622 --> 05:23.748
from Comparative Lit,
Joe Bradley.

05:23.790 --> 05:25.587
Hey. The quarterback
who's taking C.U.

05:25.625 --> 05:26.887
to the Rose Bowl, right?

05:26.926 --> 05:29.258
- The quarterback, anyway.
- Burger done.

05:29.295 --> 05:30.262
Bring on the BLT.

05:30.296 --> 05:31.888
Whoa. Don't waste time.

05:31.931 --> 05:33.057
Mowing. Go, boy.

05:33.099 --> 05:34.623
Why? Why is he doing this?

05:34.667 --> 05:35.964
We're on a winning streak.

05:36.002 --> 05:37.128
And Tiny's superstitious.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.070
A.K., don't go
spreading that around.

05:39.105 --> 05:40.697
Someone might get
the wrong idea.

05:40.740 --> 05:42.367
Yeah, that's for sure.

05:42.408 --> 05:43.841
I think it's pretty silly.

05:43.876 --> 05:46.572
Okay, but do you want
to be the one to tell him?

05:46.612 --> 05:48.136
Uh, no, thanks.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.445
I don't think I want to be
an hors d'oeuvre at this moment.

05:50.483 --> 05:52.644
Hey, Joe, I think
I saw your order ready.

05:52.685 --> 05:54.846
Double cheeseburger, no tomato,
baked potato,

05:54.887 --> 05:56.286
plain, a slice of cherry pie.

05:56.322 --> 05:58.449
Isn't that the winning
streak special?

05:58.491 --> 05:59.890
Busted.

05:59.926 --> 06:03.191
Okay, so I taught Tiny
everything he knows.

06:03.229 --> 06:05.493
So, just how superstitious
are you?

06:05.531 --> 06:07.226
On a scale of one to ten?

06:08.101 --> 06:09.932
Eleven.

06:09.969 --> 06:12.130
I mean, when you're winning,
it's not like

06:12.171 --> 06:14.639
you don't change your underwear
or anything, is it?

06:14.674 --> 06:16.266
Define change.

06:16.309 --> 06:18.038
Once a day.

06:18.077 --> 06:20.477
I think my food's getting cold.

06:20.513 --> 06:22.242
That-That's disgusting.

06:22.281 --> 06:24.078
Don, sometimes they
don't wear underwear.

06:24.117 --> 06:27.450
Oh. You're kidding, right?

06:27.487 --> 06:30.251
Sorry, but it's your fault.

06:30.289 --> 06:33.019
You're incredibly cute
when you're being teased.

06:35.161 --> 06:37.129
Um, I got to go to class.

06:37.163 --> 06:38.221
When will I see you again?

06:40.933 --> 06:43.299
Are you going
to the After Dark tonight?

06:43.336 --> 06:45.497
I am now.

06:49.008 --> 06:51.533
Bye.

06:58.151 --> 06:59.982
There you are.

07:00.086 --> 07:01.212
Hey, Clare.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.482
Hi.

07:02.522 --> 07:04.319
I've been wanting
to talk to you.

07:04.357 --> 07:05.483
Yeah, me-me, too.

07:05.525 --> 07:06.890
What happened
in the hotel last week,

07:06.926 --> 07:08.052
what happened between us...

07:08.094 --> 07:12.360
Well, nothing happened
between us.

07:12.398 --> 07:14.628
I know, and I think we're lucky.

07:14.667 --> 07:15.793
Yeah, I know. Me, too.

07:15.835 --> 07:17.268
I don't know what I was thinking

07:17.303 --> 07:19.601
going to a hotel room
with you in the first place.

07:19.639 --> 07:20.663
Me, either.

07:20.706 --> 07:22.037
Well, I know
what you were thinking.

07:22.074 --> 07:23.336
Please don't flatter yourself.

07:23.376 --> 07:25.310
It was a fleeting
thought at best,

07:25.344 --> 07:26.936
but I had nightmares
all week. It...

07:27.013 --> 07:28.139
It wouldn't have worked.

07:28.181 --> 07:29.614
Speaking of, uh, nightmares,

07:29.649 --> 07:31.640
can you tell me what you're
wearing to the party tonight

07:31.684 --> 07:33.276
so I can avoid
having any contact with you?

07:33.319 --> 07:35.287
And I was so looking forward

07:35.321 --> 07:36.948
to your intellectual
superiority.

07:37.023 --> 07:40.584
You know, I'm... I'm going
to miss tutoring you.

07:40.626 --> 07:43.390
I was actually beginning
to enjoy the concept

07:43.429 --> 07:46.592
of getting paid to constantly
remind you of your shortcomings.

07:46.632 --> 07:49.123
I'm sure you'll find
someone else to condescend to.

07:49.168 --> 07:52.763
Yeah, but it won't be nearly
as much fun, Steve.

08:08.154 --> 08:09.519
I'm hungry.

08:09.555 --> 08:11.045
David, what's with

08:11.090 --> 08:12.557
the camper from hell outside

08:12.592 --> 08:13.718
taking up three spaces?

08:13.759 --> 08:15.420
We don't have enough room
as it is.

08:15.461 --> 08:18.259
Oh, Nat's helping out
this Madame Raven.

08:18.297 --> 08:20.288
What's a Madame Raven?

08:21.734 --> 08:23.395
That's a Madame Raven.

08:23.436 --> 08:25.427
She's a fortune-teller.

08:25.471 --> 08:27.132
What is she doing here?

08:27.173 --> 08:29.937
Well, I'm not really sure,

08:30.009 --> 08:31.476
but it looks like she's staying.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.001
David, I'll be right back.

08:34.514 --> 08:35.741
20 bucks a pop?

08:35.780 --> 08:37.304
It's a little steep, isn't it?

08:37.350 --> 08:40.513
Madame Raven didn't know
love had a price.

08:40.553 --> 08:41.952
It doesn't.

08:42.054 --> 08:44.784
And this potion would be
priceless if it really worked.

08:44.824 --> 08:46.291
Listen, Nat, we need to talk.

08:46.325 --> 08:48.520
Valerie, I want you
to meet Madame Raven.

08:48.561 --> 08:50.051
Hi.

08:50.096 --> 08:52.963
You are a very busy woman.

08:53.065 --> 08:54.965
Sometimes too busy

08:55.067 --> 08:57.627
to see the effect
you have on people.

08:57.670 --> 09:00.070
Listen, Nat, we're gonna have
a full house tonight.

09:00.106 --> 09:02.040
The rag lady's got to go.

09:02.074 --> 09:04.406
It's extremely bad luck
to turf a fortune teller.

09:04.443 --> 09:07.776
So, do you have to give her
the keys to the candy store?

09:07.813 --> 09:09.303
You're having a party?

09:09.348 --> 09:11.111
I could tell fortunes.

09:11.150 --> 09:12.549
Ten dollars a reading.

09:12.585 --> 09:14.348
Five with a student I.D.

09:15.588 --> 09:17.647
Oh, want to sit over here, Tom?

09:17.690 --> 09:20.454
She wants to hang a shingle
and tell fortunes.

09:20.493 --> 09:22.051
You know that would be great,

09:22.094 --> 09:24.460
but I've already seen my future,
and you're not in it.

09:30.102 --> 09:33.094
Hey, how's it going?

09:33.139 --> 09:35.300
It's done.

09:35.341 --> 09:37.309
Are you okay?

09:37.343 --> 09:39.937
'Cause I've been here a lot,
and you seem distracted.

09:40.046 --> 09:42.071
I've got a lot on my mind.

09:45.651 --> 09:47.278
It's beautiful.

09:47.320 --> 09:48.947
Probably worth twice
what I'm paying.

09:49.021 --> 09:50.386
Great.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.721
Make the check payable
to my landlord.

09:52.758 --> 09:54.350
Why?

09:54.393 --> 09:55.519
Are you behind on rent?

09:55.561 --> 09:57.119
How is that possible?

09:57.163 --> 09:59.654
I mean, I thought the opening
of your gallery was a big hit.

10:01.300 --> 10:02.790
Right, none of my business.

10:03.836 --> 10:06.532
I need to get paid.

10:06.572 --> 10:11.669
Look, I'll get a check to you
by the end of the day, okay?

10:13.379 --> 10:15.244
Colin...

10:15.281 --> 10:17.249
if you need anything,

10:17.283 --> 10:19.251
anything at all,

10:19.285 --> 10:20.877
I'll be here for you.

10:20.920 --> 10:22.581
Thanks.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.920
It's nice to know
someone's in my corner.

10:37.169 --> 10:39.160
I see...

10:39.205 --> 10:41.298
great distress in your life.

10:42.842 --> 10:45.003
Well, my mom hasn't been well.

10:45.111 --> 10:47.602
I see sadness.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.012
She is getting better, though.

10:49.115 --> 10:52.312
And hope in the form
of a savior.

10:52.351 --> 10:54.148
A soul mate.

10:54.186 --> 10:56.984
Oh, that's, uh, Valerie.

10:57.023 --> 10:59.719
You are in love,
but there is uncertainty.

10:59.759 --> 11:01.624
Misunderstanding.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.219
Someone else, perhaps?

11:03.262 --> 11:06.720
Well, there were others
in the past.

11:06.766 --> 11:08.791
But now? Who?

11:08.834 --> 11:11.962
The, uh, crystal ball
has clouded.

11:12.038 --> 11:13.972
We must consult again later.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.406
Later? What am I supposed
to do in the meantime?

11:16.442 --> 11:19.775
You love her,
you want her to love you.

11:19.812 --> 11:24.215
Madame Raven has just the thing.

11:24.250 --> 11:26.343
A love potion.

11:26.385 --> 11:27.909
Wait a second. Is that the stuff

11:27.953 --> 11:29.750
you were cooking up
in the Peach Pit?

11:29.789 --> 11:30.915
No thanks, really.

11:30.956 --> 11:34.483
You drink some,
give some to your intended,

11:34.527 --> 11:38.224
and I promise, love will flower.

11:52.011 --> 11:54.138
Making a happy face
or a sad face?

11:54.180 --> 11:56.774
I haven't decided yet.

11:56.816 --> 11:57.874
What are you doing here?

11:57.917 --> 11:59.782
I wanted to see if you're okay.

12:01.821 --> 12:03.311
Fine.

12:03.355 --> 12:04.322
Never better.

12:04.356 --> 12:05.880
Yeah.

12:05.925 --> 12:06.914
Yeah, me, too.

12:10.329 --> 12:12.820
Shouldn't you be finishing
your mural or something?

12:16.669 --> 12:18.296
What makes you
think I haven't?

12:18.337 --> 12:20.601
You don't have a job yet.

12:22.641 --> 12:24.734
I got to tell you,
I just keep thinking

12:24.777 --> 12:26.677
getting a job means
I'm not really an artist.

12:26.712 --> 12:29.545
Aren't you the one who told me
that most living artists

12:29.582 --> 12:31.277
don't really make
a living at it?

12:31.317 --> 12:32.477
Yeah.

12:32.518 --> 12:33.610
But I always expected

12:33.652 --> 12:36.450
myself to be the exception
to that rule.

12:36.489 --> 12:37.751
Me and David Hockney.

12:37.790 --> 12:39.690
A little humility
might do you good.

12:39.725 --> 12:41.192
Trust me, I'm humble.

12:41.227 --> 12:44.526
In fact, I'm begging.

12:44.563 --> 12:46.463
Please come to
the unveiling tonight.

12:49.502 --> 12:50.491
I don't know.

12:50.536 --> 12:52.697
Will you at least consider it?

12:53.739 --> 12:56.731
I'll consider considering it.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.336
Thanks for stopping by.

13:05.151 --> 13:06.618
All right.

13:12.958 --> 13:14.619
It's okay.

13:14.660 --> 13:16.787
Tought I taw a putty tat
who needed a bath.

13:16.829 --> 13:17.796
Come here, you.

13:17.830 --> 13:18.956
Oh, she won't mind.

13:19.031 --> 13:20.794
Poor baby, she can't
stop scratching.

13:20.833 --> 13:22.664
Be careful, 'cause when
you put cats in water,

13:22.701 --> 13:23.668
they don't like it.

13:23.702 --> 13:24.862
Okay, she'll... Ow!

13:24.904 --> 13:26.269
- Ooh, see, see!
- Ow!

13:26.305 --> 13:27.431
- Give me that.
- Mm.

13:27.473 --> 13:28.701
Hey, that's bad.

13:28.741 --> 13:30.368
- Go disinfect that.
- Whoa.

13:30.409 --> 13:33.572
Trouble has a dark side.

13:33.612 --> 13:35.807
See what you're doing?

13:46.492 --> 13:47.481
Dylan.

13:58.637 --> 14:00.628
Band-Aids are in this cabinet.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.198
Well, I'd like to talk about
what was in this cabinet.

14:03.242 --> 14:05.142
Ah, it's pretty
self-explanatory, isn't it?

14:05.177 --> 14:06.269
Guns make me nervous, Dylan.

14:06.312 --> 14:07.279
Why do you have this?

14:07.313 --> 14:09.907
Rough city, need protection.

14:09.949 --> 14:12.349
Protection from the street crime
in Beverly Hills, I see.

14:12.384 --> 14:14.716
I just don't want anybody
to get the drop on me, okay?

14:14.753 --> 14:16.380
Anyone or my dad?

14:18.891 --> 14:21.325
Dylan, I thought you gave up
this revenge business.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.952
I did.

14:22.995 --> 14:25.589
I just, I can't be sure
the same can be said

14:25.631 --> 14:26.825
- of your father.
- Oh, great.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.231
Well, now you're both
armed and dangerous.

14:28.267 --> 14:29.632
No, I'm just armed.

14:29.668 --> 14:31.602
Get rid of the gun
before someone gets killed.

14:37.076 --> 14:39.044
I mean it, Dylan. Say it.

14:43.382 --> 14:46.783
All right, all right.

14:46.819 --> 14:48.150
I'll get rid of it.

15:03.535 --> 15:05.025
Ray.

15:05.070 --> 15:07.038
- Donna, hi.
- Hey.

15:07.072 --> 15:09.302
Your mom told me
where I could find you.

15:09.341 --> 15:10.330
Listen, I've been thinking about

15:10.376 --> 15:11.570
the conversation
we had this morning.

15:11.610 --> 15:13.441
Hey, I was wrong
to just show up.

15:13.479 --> 15:15.208
I should never have done that.
I'm sorry.

15:15.247 --> 15:16.441
Please, just listen,

15:16.482 --> 15:19.315
'cause I really need you
to understand this.

15:19.351 --> 15:21.319
I'd like to talk to people
at the party tonight.

15:21.353 --> 15:24.083
And I just, I don't want you
to get upset about it.

15:24.123 --> 15:26.091
So what, you, uh,
you have a date?

15:26.125 --> 15:28.093
No. No, I don't.

15:28.127 --> 15:29.151
But there is someone else.

15:29.194 --> 15:31.628
I'm not sure.

15:31.664 --> 15:33.097
But I'd like to find out.

15:33.132 --> 15:35.930
And I can't do that if
I feel like I'm being watched.

15:35.968 --> 15:37.435
Is that the way I make you feel?

15:37.469 --> 15:38.629
Sometimes, yeah.

15:40.039 --> 15:42.234
Are you asking me not to come
to this party tonight?

15:42.274 --> 15:45.732
I'm asking you
to go as my friend.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.177
And if you can't, then don't.

15:47.212 --> 15:48.736
Look, if you want
to cool things off,

15:48.781 --> 15:51.648
that's okay,
I can understand that.

15:51.684 --> 15:53.618
But I am going to win
you back, Donna.

15:55.654 --> 15:56.985
But you understand
about tonight, right?

15:57.056 --> 15:58.887
Yeah.

15:58.924 --> 16:00.915
Look, it's best this way, okay?

16:04.496 --> 16:06.828
Yeah, sure it is.

16:06.865 --> 16:09.060
I got to say, I miss you.

16:09.101 --> 16:10.796
I thought you might
have called me.

16:10.836 --> 16:12.133
You okay here?

16:12.171 --> 16:13.297
Yeah, everything's great.

16:13.339 --> 16:14.431
Good.

16:14.473 --> 16:15.701
That was worrying me.

16:17.409 --> 16:19.900
He wants to meet
with you... talk.

16:19.945 --> 16:23.210
He's pretty broken
up about all this.

16:23.248 --> 16:24.306
I don't know, Bruno.

16:24.350 --> 16:25.647
He'll meet you anyplace you say,

16:25.684 --> 16:26.878
anytime.

16:26.919 --> 16:28.546
He just wants to talk.

16:28.587 --> 16:30.851
Even the Peach Pit,
if you want to.

16:36.228 --> 16:37.786
What's going on?

16:37.830 --> 16:39.821
It's okay, Dylan.

16:39.865 --> 16:40.957
My business here is done.

16:41.033 --> 16:42.227
Yeah, I would say so.

16:46.438 --> 16:47.769
You'll let me know?

16:47.806 --> 16:48.966
Yeah.

16:49.074 --> 16:50.371
Thanks for coming, Bruno.

16:50.409 --> 16:51.398
I missed you, too.

16:55.280 --> 16:56.247
Just testing.

17:02.254 --> 17:05.690
Do I want to know
what that's about?

17:05.723 --> 17:06.884
My father.

17:08.926 --> 17:11.327
He's asking, Dylan.

17:11.363 --> 17:13.661
Maybe it's his way
of declaring a truce.

17:39.591 --> 17:41.923
I am so sorry.

17:41.960 --> 17:43.951
Please, let me
help you with that.

17:43.996 --> 17:45.190
I am Madame Raven.

17:45.230 --> 17:47.562
I didn't know anyone was there.

17:47.599 --> 17:49.863
Isn't it your job
to know things like that?

18:00.512 --> 18:02.275
You have a secret, my dear.

18:02.314 --> 18:03.406
Right.

18:03.449 --> 18:04.416
I'm hungry.

18:04.450 --> 18:05.917
She's not the only one.

18:05.951 --> 18:08.010
Love potion, huh?

18:08.053 --> 18:09.247
Buy two, get one free.

18:10.289 --> 18:11.813
No, I think we're doing

18:11.857 --> 18:13.154
just fine on our own.

18:13.192 --> 18:17.185
Does the other boy
think so, too?

18:18.230 --> 18:19.925
What other boy?

18:20.032 --> 18:21.727
The one in Seattle.

18:23.135 --> 18:24.932
Susan, let's go.

18:25.037 --> 18:27.232
Um, go ahead and order.

18:27.272 --> 18:28.239
I'll be right there.

18:28.273 --> 18:29.865
I-I just left something
in the car.

18:37.549 --> 18:39.540
So how'd you know
there was somebody in Seattle?

18:42.387 --> 18:44.912
Madame Raven knows all.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.049
Ha!

18:46.091 --> 18:47.956
In other words, lucky guess.

18:47.993 --> 18:49.483
Interesting.

18:49.528 --> 18:51.962
Very interesting.

18:52.064 --> 18:54.055
Right. Like you see
something in there.

18:56.468 --> 18:57.958
Do you see something in there?

18:58.003 --> 18:59.732
Yes.

18:59.771 --> 19:01.830
I see you paying me ten dollars.

19:06.845 --> 19:08.073
Why am I doing this?

19:08.113 --> 19:11.082
Because you are confused.

19:11.116 --> 19:13.744
Because this man from your past,
this Jonathan...

19:13.785 --> 19:15.252
Whoa-whoa.

19:15.287 --> 19:16.481
How'd you know his name?

19:16.522 --> 19:18.319
Did somebody put you up to this?

19:18.357 --> 19:21.087
This man is still
very much on your mind.

19:21.126 --> 19:22.115
True?

19:24.930 --> 19:26.397
Yes.

19:26.431 --> 19:27.398
True.

19:27.432 --> 19:29.627
I mean, I...

19:29.668 --> 19:31.067
really care about Brandon,
you know,

19:31.103 --> 19:32.627
but we're total opposites.

19:32.671 --> 19:34.366
And this other guy, we...

19:34.406 --> 19:37.603
I don't know... we just have
so much in common, and...

19:37.643 --> 19:38.803
Oh, I'm so confused,

19:38.844 --> 19:40.675
I really, I... I don't know
what to do.

19:42.281 --> 19:44.078
It is fading.

19:44.116 --> 19:45.208
That is all I see.

19:45.250 --> 19:48.378
The rest you have to see
for yourself.

19:49.388 --> 19:51.253
Of course,
for another ten dollars,

19:51.290 --> 19:52.484
anything is possible.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.367
You know, I got to tell you,
with everything you and Dylan

20:05.404 --> 20:07.929
have been up against, you
really have made it work.

20:07.973 --> 20:09.270
I'm glad for you.

20:09.308 --> 20:10.275
Thank you.

20:10.309 --> 20:12.470
Antonia.

20:14.513 --> 20:16.447
Dad, this is Brandon.

20:16.481 --> 20:17.641
Brandon, this is my father.

20:17.683 --> 20:19.651
How do you do?

20:19.685 --> 20:20.811
Talk to you later, Toni.

20:20.852 --> 20:22.843
Bye, Brandon.

20:27.859 --> 20:29.486
You wanted to see me,
here I am.

20:29.528 --> 20:30.790
Okay, all right.

20:30.829 --> 20:32.729
I behaved badly the other day.

20:32.764 --> 20:33.731
We both did.

20:33.765 --> 20:36.666
Come home with me now,

20:36.702 --> 20:38.636
and we'll forget about
the whole thing.

20:38.670 --> 20:41.696
I'm not ten years old.

20:41.740 --> 20:43.298
You can't
order me around anymore.

20:43.342 --> 20:46.004
Antonia, you're still young,

20:46.044 --> 20:47.341
and you don't have to settle.

20:47.379 --> 20:49.904
Believe me.

20:49.948 --> 20:51.848
There'll be others
besides Dylan.

20:51.883 --> 20:54.283
I don't want others.

20:54.319 --> 20:55.308
I want Dylan.

20:56.355 --> 20:59.381
And I want something from you.

20:59.424 --> 21:02.188
I want you to look me in the eye
and tell me the truth.

21:03.729 --> 21:06.857
Did you kill Dylan's father?

21:10.269 --> 21:12.328
No.

21:15.941 --> 21:17.408
Did you have him killed?

21:19.444 --> 21:22.311
Toni, what a question.

21:24.349 --> 21:25.976
That's not
a straight answer, Dad.

21:26.018 --> 21:28.953
Look...

21:28.987 --> 21:31.979
don't get into this.

21:32.024 --> 21:34.185
You don't know the first thing
about Jack McKay.

21:34.226 --> 21:37.320
You don't know
what kind of man he was.

21:37.362 --> 21:38.920
You don't know
why he was killed.

21:38.964 --> 21:40.829
I don't care
what kind of person he was

21:40.866 --> 21:43.198
or why he was killed.

21:43.235 --> 21:45.703
All I care about is if you
had anything to do with it.

21:45.737 --> 21:48.729
Now you never lied to me,

21:48.774 --> 21:50.765
and I know you won't
lie to me now.

21:55.113 --> 21:57.673
Did you have Jack McKay killed?

22:20.138 --> 22:22.265
What is it?

22:22.307 --> 22:24.298
What did he say?

22:26.678 --> 22:29.010
You were right about him, Dylan.

23:00.078 --> 23:03.536
You come to see me
at my daughter's wedding.

23:03.582 --> 23:05.914
Oh, Steve Martin,
Father of the Bride.

23:05.951 --> 23:09.648
No, no, no.

23:09.688 --> 23:12.851
Someday... and this
day may never come...

23:12.891 --> 23:16.088
I may come to you and
ask you for a favor.

23:16.128 --> 23:17.755
Oh, right, I-I know this one.

23:17.796 --> 23:19.957
What the hell is he doing?

23:19.998 --> 23:21.124
Overacting?

23:21.166 --> 23:22.827
Doing the Godfather.

23:22.868 --> 23:24.199
Oh, well, thank you, Keats.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.204
Well, you are my favorite
animated feminist.

23:26.238 --> 23:27.535
Oh, wait a second.

23:27.572 --> 23:28.971
I'm not a cartoon.

23:29.074 --> 23:30.974
I'm the historical figure
Pocahontas.

23:31.076 --> 23:32.941
I do not sing,
I do not like wind.

23:32.978 --> 23:35.310
Well, I'm glad
we got that straight.

23:35.347 --> 23:37.781
You know, Pokey,
uh, maybe you and I

23:37.816 --> 23:39.181
should go get
our fortune told.

23:39.217 --> 23:40.980
Well, no!
I-I mean, it's-it's,

23:41.019 --> 23:42.987
uh, it's just such
a waste of time.

23:43.021 --> 23:45.353
Well, you'll have to excuse
me if I indulge myself.

23:45.390 --> 23:48.382
I have to see if you're gonna
do a rain dance for me later.

24:02.908 --> 24:03.897
Ahoy, matey.

24:03.942 --> 24:04.909
Hey.

24:04.943 --> 24:06.740
There's a devil on my shoulder.

24:06.778 --> 24:08.712
And here I thought
you were an angel.

24:08.747 --> 24:10.738
Shh. I'm undercover tonight.

24:15.086 --> 24:17.384
So what do we really
want to know about?

24:17.422 --> 24:18.650
I know.

24:18.690 --> 24:20.055
How about how
the Supreme Court's gonna rule

24:20.091 --> 24:21.058
in upcoming decisions.

24:21.092 --> 24:23.686
How about our relationship?

24:23.728 --> 24:25.423
Would you settle for who's gonna
win the Super Bowl?

24:25.464 --> 24:27.489
Well, if the fix is in,
I want to know about it.

24:27.532 --> 24:28.590
Oh!

24:28.633 --> 24:31.761
Something still
stands in the way.

24:31.803 --> 24:34.670
Something hidden.

24:34.706 --> 24:36.071
A feeling for someone?

24:36.107 --> 24:38.268
Well, it's not Kelly,
'cause I'm over her.

24:38.310 --> 24:42.269
Madame Raven did not say it was
a woman who stood in the way.

24:42.314 --> 24:44.578
Well, thank you so much
for your insights.

24:44.616 --> 24:45.742
We'll be going now.

24:45.784 --> 24:47.342
I see it now.

24:47.385 --> 24:48.477
Yes.

24:48.520 --> 24:53.617
It is not a person
who stands in the way.

24:53.658 --> 24:54.784
It is something else.

24:56.094 --> 24:58.119
It is truth.

25:02.200 --> 25:03.565
That's all I see.

25:03.602 --> 25:06.799
Five bucks for her to tell
me you're not Pocahontas.

25:06.838 --> 25:08.806
That's interesting.

25:11.510 --> 25:14.172
Well, that was pretty generic.

25:14.212 --> 25:17.511
Ah, I guess you were right
about it being a waste of money.

25:19.518 --> 25:22.078
Jonathan Casten.

25:22.120 --> 25:23.382
The editor of
The Co <i>n</i> dor last year.

25:23.421 --> 25:25.286
What about him?

25:25.323 --> 25:27.348
The guy...

25:27.392 --> 25:30.486
The one standing in the way.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.656
You mean, you two...

25:33.899 --> 25:36.265
I thought you had a thing
against office romances.

25:36.301 --> 25:37.268
I do.

25:37.302 --> 25:38.496
Now.

25:38.537 --> 25:39.629
Because of him.

25:39.671 --> 25:41.298
And how come you never
told me about him?

25:41.339 --> 25:42.897
Because he's ancient history.

25:42.941 --> 25:46.536
Look, there was a time
when he meant a lot to me.

25:46.578 --> 25:49.206
And when he moved to Seattle,
I did miss him a lot, you know.

25:49.247 --> 25:50.646
But then I met you and...

26:00.559 --> 26:02.117
What was that for?

26:02.160 --> 26:03.923
For telling me the truth.

26:06.865 --> 26:08.662
Okay, it's that time.

26:09.768 --> 26:11.463
No sign of Kelly.

26:11.503 --> 26:13.334
Well, some things
you've got to do alone.

26:16.675 --> 26:19.735
Uh, greetings and, uh...
thank you all

26:19.778 --> 26:21.507
for coming tonight
for the unveiling

26:21.546 --> 26:24.538
of the Peach Pit After Dark's
new mural,

26:24.583 --> 26:25.948
painted by a gifted artist

26:26.051 --> 26:28.246
and an old friend of mine,
Colin Robbins.

26:32.757 --> 26:33.951
Thanks, Valerie.

26:34.025 --> 26:36.084
And thank you all
for coming tonight.

26:36.127 --> 26:39.062
The mural is called
"Kelly's New York."

26:39.097 --> 26:41.861
I just wish the person
who inspired me

26:41.900 --> 26:43.492
to paint this was here.

26:50.642 --> 26:55.238
Um... anyway, enjoy.

27:26.177 --> 27:28.805
Nice mural.

27:28.847 --> 27:30.144
Nice costume.

27:30.181 --> 27:32.479
You, too.

27:32.517 --> 27:34.576
Funny, we both seem to have

27:34.619 --> 27:36.211
the Western motif happening.

27:36.254 --> 27:38.688
Is it synchronicity
or did you check with Donna?

27:39.758 --> 27:40.884
I checked with Donna.

27:40.925 --> 27:42.290
Uh-huh.

27:42.327 --> 27:43.817
Want to dance?

27:55.206 --> 27:57.436
Trick or treat!

27:57.475 --> 27:59.568
Wow, trick or treat, I guess!

27:59.611 --> 28:01.408
All right, here we go,
we got chocolate,

28:01.446 --> 28:02.913
we got lollipops,
we got bubble gum.

28:03.014 --> 28:04.572
It's sugarless,
don't worry about it.

28:04.616 --> 28:07.107
Ooh, look at the cat. Nice.

28:07.152 --> 28:08.642
You should've had
a better lawyer.

28:08.687 --> 28:09.779
Here, take some extra.

28:09.821 --> 28:12.119
There you go.

28:12.157 --> 28:13.488
Think you got
enough there, slim?

28:13.525 --> 28:15.117
- It's a long trail, go ahead.
- Bye.

28:15.160 --> 28:16.354
All right, knock yourself out.

28:16.394 --> 28:18.453
See you.

28:20.532 --> 28:22.397
Trouble, come on.

28:22.434 --> 28:23.628
Hey, come on, lighten up.

28:23.668 --> 28:24.862
She's just playing
a little bit.

28:24.903 --> 28:27.064
I know she's just playing.

28:27.105 --> 28:29.039
Can we stop getting the door
for the rest of the night?

28:29.074 --> 28:33.534
Okay, but, uh, we got two bowls
of candy left here.

28:33.578 --> 28:35.239
Just set them out on the porch.

28:36.614 --> 28:38.104
What happened to all
your Halloween spirit?

28:38.149 --> 28:40.982
I was just thinking
about my father.

28:42.821 --> 28:43.947
I loved him so much.

28:44.055 --> 28:46.649
I idolized him.

28:46.691 --> 28:48.318
Now, I'm so ashamed of him.

28:51.096 --> 28:52.586
I don't know, I...

28:52.630 --> 28:55.565
I'm just afraid
of what could happen to us.

28:55.600 --> 28:58.160
I'm not.

28:58.203 --> 29:00.694
And you can't blame yourself

29:00.739 --> 29:02.138
for things
that your father's done.

29:02.173 --> 29:04.505
You just, you gotta...

29:04.542 --> 29:07.602
you gotta let it go.

29:07.645 --> 29:09.408
I did.

29:11.916 --> 29:13.543
Now, the night is young

29:13.585 --> 29:16.053
and to quote a very wise woman
I once knew,

29:16.087 --> 29:17.520
"You are going
to join the living,

29:17.555 --> 29:19.455
whether you want to or not."

29:21.126 --> 29:22.218
So come on.

29:22.260 --> 29:24.990
- Okay.
- All right.

29:27.165 --> 29:29.827
All right, I'll be a witch.

29:55.927 --> 29:58.157
If one more person comes up
and tells me that Clare and I

29:58.196 --> 29:59.925
look like a couple,
I'm gonna throttle them.

30:00.965 --> 30:03.195
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

30:03.234 --> 30:05.327
Hey, I Dream of Jeannie
and Major Nelson.

30:05.370 --> 30:07.964
- That's a great couple's
costume. - David!

30:08.039 --> 30:10.473
We're not a couple, okay?
Please, we're not a couple.

30:10.508 --> 30:12.169
Look, I am not Major Nelson.

30:12.210 --> 30:14.838
This happens to be the
official Apollo 13 uniform.

30:16.080 --> 30:17.547
Apollo 13?

30:17.582 --> 30:19.482
They wore space uniforms,
you buffoon.

30:19.517 --> 30:23.453
Look, this is their dress
uniform, okay, Einstein.

30:23.488 --> 30:24.887
Mm-hmm, okay, Major Nelson.

30:24.923 --> 30:27.414
You know what, you guys
duke it out, me and David are

30:27.458 --> 30:28.516
just going to make
the rounds, okay?

30:28.560 --> 30:29.584
Shall we go? Okay.

30:45.410 --> 30:48.004
You don't waste
any time, do you?

30:48.079 --> 30:50.206
You don't waste
any time at all.

30:50.248 --> 30:51.875
Ray, I thought
we talked about this.

30:51.916 --> 30:53.247
No, you talked about it.

30:53.284 --> 30:54.615
What about what I have to say?

30:54.652 --> 30:56.176
I love you, Donna,

30:56.221 --> 30:57.483
and I'm willing
to change for you.

30:57.522 --> 30:59.080
But all you can do is trash me.

31:00.458 --> 31:01.857
Look, man,
I'm giving you a warning.

31:01.893 --> 31:03.622
This one's gonna cut
your heart out.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.836
I'm sorry.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.303
I'm so embarrassed.

31:13.338 --> 31:15.169
Don't be.

31:15.206 --> 31:20.166
Look, can we forget that
happened and just dance?

31:20.211 --> 31:21.872
We can try.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.876
You want me to take you home?

31:37.228 --> 31:38.855
I feel weird.

31:38.897 --> 31:40.797
I think it's hot in here.

31:40.832 --> 31:42.163
It is hot in here.

31:42.200 --> 31:43.565
Maybe we should get some air.

31:48.406 --> 31:50.772
Better yet,
maybe we should just

31:50.808 --> 31:53.868
sneak into the dressing room,

31:53.912 --> 31:56.346
crank up the air conditioning?

32:10.028 --> 32:12.826
All right. Here you go.

32:12.864 --> 32:14.661
Full payment
for a job well done.

32:14.699 --> 32:15.666
Earned every penny.

32:15.700 --> 32:18.669
Thanks,
I really appreciate it.

32:18.703 --> 32:20.000
I got to go.

32:22.941 --> 32:25.375
Well, it looks like you have
a new patron of the arts?

32:25.410 --> 32:27.275
Yeah, unfortunately,
the kind of money

32:27.312 --> 32:29.439
Valerie pays
isn't gonna support me

32:29.480 --> 32:30.913
in the style to which
I've become accustomed.

32:30.949 --> 32:33.611
Well, maybe you should
change your style.

32:33.651 --> 32:36.211
Actually, I was
thinking the same thing.

32:36.254 --> 32:38.654
Remember that teaching assistant
position at C.U.?

32:38.690 --> 32:41.181
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, I'm going to take it,

32:41.225 --> 32:42.624
if they'll have me.

32:42.660 --> 32:44.252
What's gotten into you?

32:44.295 --> 32:45.990
You've gotten into me.

32:46.030 --> 32:49.693
Well, I'm glad to see
I'm having a positive effect.

32:49.734 --> 32:51.065
I like that.

32:57.475 --> 32:59.204
Let me crank this up.

32:59.243 --> 33:00.904
Yeah, it'll be
better in a second.

33:05.350 --> 33:07.147
You know, I've been thinking.

33:07.185 --> 33:09.483
About that night
in the hotel room.

33:09.520 --> 33:11.351
Yeah, me, too.

33:11.389 --> 33:13.220
Clare, it's not like, uh,

33:13.257 --> 33:15.452
I'm not attracted to you, I am.

33:15.493 --> 33:17.927
And I'm attracted to you, too.

33:17.962 --> 33:21.159
I just don't think
we'd work as a couple.

33:21.199 --> 33:26.262
No, I mean, you're a typical,
male-chauvinist, frat guy.

33:26.304 --> 33:28.966
And you're a self-righteous,
stuck up snob.

33:29.007 --> 33:30.099
We'd hate each other.

33:30.141 --> 33:31.108
I hate you now.

33:31.142 --> 33:33.167
Not as much as I hate you.

33:33.211 --> 33:34.644
- You want to?
- Uh-huh.

33:34.679 --> 33:35.873
I thought you'd never ask.

33:35.913 --> 33:37.574
Come here.

33:43.688 --> 33:45.656
You sure go all out.

33:47.025 --> 33:49.994
Yeah, my roommate and her
boyfriend must have done it.

33:50.028 --> 33:50.995
They're beautiful, aren't they?

33:51.062 --> 33:53.053
Yeah, they are.

33:55.266 --> 33:57.598
And so are you.

33:59.137 --> 34:01.731
Which is part of what makes
what I'm going to say so hard.

34:03.975 --> 34:07.411
Maybe I should back off,
give you some space.

34:07.445 --> 34:09.436
What do you mean?

34:09.480 --> 34:13.541
Just what happened at the party
with your ex.

34:13.583 --> 34:17.953
I figure that maybe
right now is not the, uh...

34:18.022 --> 34:19.922
the best time
to start something up.

34:20.958 --> 34:23.859
I'm sorry.

34:38.775 --> 34:40.402
Ray, what are you doing here?

34:40.445 --> 34:42.936
I was waiting for you.

34:42.980 --> 34:44.538
Look, I'm sorry
that I lost my head.

34:44.581 --> 34:45.775
Let me explain.

34:45.817 --> 34:47.978
No, you know, you can't
keep coming back here

34:48.085 --> 34:49.746
trying to explain things away.

34:49.786 --> 34:51.516
Come on, Donna, I want
this to work, okay?

34:51.556 --> 34:53.217
What do you think
of all the pumpkins?

34:53.257 --> 34:55.157
I lit them all up for you.

34:55.193 --> 34:56.820
And then you spied on me.

34:56.860 --> 34:58.328
Ray, it is over. Over!

34:58.362 --> 35:00.489
What is wrong with you that
you can't understand that?

35:00.531 --> 35:01.759
What's wrong with me?

35:01.799 --> 35:03.664
You were the one
out there acting

35:03.701 --> 35:05.396
- like a little slut tonight.
- How dare you.

35:05.436 --> 35:07.097
Look, he is not
the one for you.

35:07.138 --> 35:08.196
We belong together.

35:08.239 --> 35:10.264
I do not want to talk
to you anymore.

35:10.308 --> 35:11.502
I'm going inside.

35:11.542 --> 35:13.669
- Do not turn your back on me,
all right? - Ow!

35:13.711 --> 35:15.508
- Let go! - Not until you
at least listen to me.

35:15.546 --> 35:16.706
She said let go.

35:16.747 --> 35:18.339
Hey, take a hike, Captain Hook.

35:18.382 --> 35:19.474
Ow, Ray, you're hurting me.

35:19.517 --> 35:20.882
Did you hear me?

35:22.820 --> 35:26.449
How's it feel to be
on the receiving end?

35:32.029 --> 35:33.553
That's enough, please.

35:33.598 --> 35:34.792
Doesn't feel too good, does it?

35:38.503 --> 35:40.164
This isn't over.

35:47.512 --> 35:48.809
It's over.

35:51.315 --> 35:53.374
It's over.

36:06.297 --> 36:08.162
Thanks.

36:10.034 --> 36:12.298
No problem.

36:12.336 --> 36:14.167
For everything.

36:14.205 --> 36:16.435
I'd hate to think what
would have happened

36:16.474 --> 36:17.668
if I didn't come back.

36:17.708 --> 36:19.505
Yeah, me, too.

36:22.413 --> 36:25.780
Are you sure you're all right?

36:25.816 --> 36:27.784
Yeah.

36:27.818 --> 36:30.514
But I'm curious.

36:30.555 --> 36:32.045
What made you come back?

36:32.089 --> 36:34.956
On my way back to my car,

36:35.026 --> 36:37.551
I uh, I changed my mind
about something.

36:37.595 --> 36:39.324
What?

36:39.363 --> 36:42.389
That stuff I said before.

36:42.433 --> 36:45.960
About giving you time and space
to work things out with your ex.

36:47.238 --> 36:51.072
That was my fear talking.

36:52.743 --> 36:56.770
Well, I'm not so scary.

36:56.814 --> 36:58.577
You'd know that
if you knew me better.

36:58.616 --> 37:01.449
I'd like that.

37:15.399 --> 37:19.335
Well, the party was
a big hit tonight.

37:19.370 --> 37:21.930
I couldn't have done it
without you.

37:27.378 --> 37:29.903
Why are we doing this?

37:29.947 --> 37:31.915
Because I like you.

37:31.949 --> 37:33.041
Why else?

37:33.084 --> 37:36.281
I don't know.

37:36.320 --> 37:37.912
Guilt...

37:37.955 --> 37:39.388
Ioneliness...

37:41.592 --> 37:43.116
Madame Raven's love potion.

37:43.160 --> 37:45.492
You didn't.

37:45.529 --> 37:47.292
Yeah.

37:48.532 --> 37:51.160
That is so sweet.

37:55.072 --> 37:56.664
So, is it me or the potion?

37:56.707 --> 38:01.144
David, there is no such
thing as a love potion,

38:01.178 --> 38:03.840
okay?

38:06.250 --> 38:07.842
Okay.

38:21.699 --> 38:23.929
Hey.

38:24.035 --> 38:26.128
Hey, Steve, am I mistaken,

38:26.170 --> 38:28.638
or did you have
company last night?

38:28.673 --> 38:33.167
Yeah, not that it's any of your
business, but Clare stayed over.

38:33.210 --> 38:34.905
I don't know what got into us.

38:34.945 --> 38:37.937
Must've been
something you drank.

38:37.982 --> 38:40.348
Yeah, well, it must've been
something pretty strong

38:40.384 --> 38:41.646
to do what I did.

38:41.686 --> 38:45.452
Sounds like Madame Raven's
love potion to me.

38:45.489 --> 38:46.513
Love potion?

38:46.557 --> 38:47.922
Mm-hmm.

38:47.958 --> 38:50.222
Hey, Nat. What happened
to Madame Raven?

38:50.261 --> 38:51.956
She did what all
fortune-tellers do,

38:51.996 --> 38:54.055
she disappeared without a trace

38:54.098 --> 38:55.292
and without paying her bill.

38:58.269 --> 38:59.793
Pardon me.
Are you the owner?

38:59.837 --> 39:01.896
Yeah.

39:01.972 --> 39:03.803
Well, maybe you can help me out.

39:03.841 --> 39:05.809
Have you ever seen
this woman before?

39:05.843 --> 39:07.105
She goes by the name
of Madame Raven

39:07.144 --> 39:08.702
and sells some kind
of bogus love potion.

39:08.746 --> 39:11.306
No license to vend,
and to tell you the truth,

39:11.349 --> 39:14.807
we don't know what
the hell is in that stuff.

39:14.852 --> 39:17.685
Anyone seen her?

39:17.722 --> 39:19.280
There was a report
that she was around.

39:19.323 --> 39:20.381
No, not me.

39:23.427 --> 39:24.553
Can't help you, Officer.

39:28.733 --> 39:30.564
Well, thanks for your time.

39:33.003 --> 39:35.198
You guys believe that?

39:35.239 --> 39:37.104
Arresting a fortune-teller
on Halloween?

39:37.141 --> 39:39.939
That's like hauling
Santa Claus in on Christmas.

39:40.010 --> 39:43.776
Or dropping a dime on
the Easter Bunny for egg fraud.

39:43.814 --> 39:45.441
Well, I, uh,

39:45.483 --> 39:49.920
I happened to manage
to hold on to one bottle of it.

39:49.954 --> 39:51.353
How much you want for that?

39:51.389 --> 39:52.947
It's not for sale.

39:53.057 --> 39:55.719
Oh, everything's for sale.

39:55.760 --> 39:57.421
No, not to you.

39:57.461 --> 39:59.429
Oh, come on, I could
use a bottle of that.

39:59.463 --> 40:01.158
I'm gonna have to go ugly early.

40:01.198 --> 40:03.063
That's true,
but you're not gonna get it.

40:07.471 --> 40:09.962
My father died right there.

40:10.040 --> 40:12.668
And this is where I stood.

40:12.710 --> 40:16.407
Why'd you want
to come here, Dylan?

40:16.447 --> 40:20.543
I don't know.

40:20.584 --> 40:23.815
I just had to see it
one more time...

40:23.854 --> 40:26.516
before I let it go.

40:26.557 --> 40:29.253
Do you think you can
really do that?

40:32.830 --> 40:35.162
We can't stay here.

40:35.199 --> 40:38.635
We got to move.

40:38.669 --> 40:41.103
Where do we go?

40:41.138 --> 40:44.471
Well, the good thing
about that is,

40:44.508 --> 40:47.204
we've got a whole
lifetime to fill up.

40:47.244 --> 40:49.007
We can go anywhere you want.

40:59.290 --> 41:02.384
I want warm weather,
beautiful scenery...

41:02.426 --> 41:05.589
It sounds to me
like you want Hawaii.

41:05.629 --> 41:08.120
Hawaii, what's in Hawaii?

41:08.165 --> 41:12.124
My mom, my sister.

41:12.169 --> 41:15.138
Sun, sand, surf.

41:15.172 --> 41:17.367
And what about school?

41:19.477 --> 41:22.913
We'll get you enrolled in one
as soon as we get there.

41:22.947 --> 41:24.744
Me?

41:24.782 --> 41:28.274
Yeah, don't worry about me.

41:28.319 --> 41:32.085
I am gonna do something
with my life.

41:32.122 --> 41:34.352
So, what do you say?

41:34.391 --> 41:37.827
I say you'd better answer
my question first.

41:39.363 --> 41:40.955
Can you really let it all go?

42:17.167 --> 42:18.862
So, what do you say now?

42:21.372 --> 42:26.366
- Aloha.
- Aloha.

42:26.410 --> 42:27.741
Mm-hmm.
