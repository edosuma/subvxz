20:22.098 --> 20:24.059
I care about the patient first.

20:24.142 --> 20:25.477
And the other shrinks don't?

20:25.560 --> 20:27.562
- Don't?
- You said you're not like the others,

20:27.646 --> 20:29.439
that you care about the patients first.

20:29.522 --> 20:32.442
And the other doctors,
what do they care about?

20:32.525 --> 20:35.904
Well, everyone has their own approach.

20:37.322 --> 20:42.327
But I believe that talking
and exposing what's bothering you

20:42.410 --> 20:46.373
is the healthiest, and coupled
with things like meditation,

20:46.456 --> 20:49.125
leading a balanced life, and...

20:50.627 --> 20:54.589
if I find that there's no other option,

20:54.673 --> 20:56.091
medication.

20:56.174 --> 20:58.969
No drug company kickbacks?

21:00.553 --> 21:02.555
Look, I'm sorry.

21:02.639 --> 21:05.267
I get defensive
when I have to talk about me.

21:05.350 --> 21:07.060
It's just so...

21:09.729 --> 21:11.690
- Weird?
- Yeah.

21:11.773 --> 21:13.108
Fucking weird.

21:14.025 --> 21:15.568
- Mm-hmm.
- Sorry.

21:18.029 --> 21:20.991
Well, why don't we do this?

21:23.576 --> 21:29.582
Why don't we just start over,
and we'll go at your speed.

22:17.505 --> 22:18.548
You coming or what?

22:25.513 --> 22:27.474
[Clara] <i>You want some of this?</i>

22:27.557 --> 22:28.558
Oh, yeah, thanks.

22:28.641 --> 22:31.227
Whew. You're getting slower.

22:31.311 --> 22:33.354
- [laughs]
- Mnh-mnh!

22:34.105 --> 22:36.733
- Sprinter versus long distance.
- Mm.

22:37.734 --> 22:40.361
No, I-I thought I saw something.

22:40.445 --> 22:42.489
It was probably a deer.

22:42.572 --> 22:44.574
Have I told you
how glad I am that you're back?

22:44.657 --> 22:47.577
[chuckles] You must've been
so bored without me.

22:47.660 --> 22:51.581
No, I just... It's nice having
an old friend around.

22:51.664 --> 22:54.167
Well, it won't be that exciting.

22:54.250 --> 22:56.294
Well, can we at least go out
a few times?

22:56.377 --> 22:58.713
I mean, bring, um...

22:58.797 --> 22:59.964
Miles?

23:01.382 --> 23:02.425
- Miles.
- Miles.

23:03.510 --> 23:06.513
- [chuckles]
- Miles.

23:07.514 --> 23:09.182
Yeah, well...

23:10.016 --> 23:11.059
Jane.

23:12.018 --> 23:13.978
Clara, don't.

23:14.062 --> 23:16.314
I'm proud of you.

23:16.397 --> 23:17.899
Okay, thank you.

23:17.982 --> 23:19.567
I really am.

23:19.651 --> 23:22.695
[sighs]

23:22.779 --> 23:25.448
[Clara laughs]

23:25.532 --> 23:27.534
[voyeur panting]

23:27.617 --> 23:28.993
You ready?

23:29.077 --> 23:30.245
[slow rock playing]

23:30.328 --> 23:32.413
- [Jane] No.
- [Clara laughing]

23:32.497 --> 23:33.957
[Miles] Best job in the world.

<i># There's no place like home... #</i>

23:40.672 --> 23:42.340
This place is nice.

23:42.423 --> 23:45.385
Yeah. It was a nice place
to be a kid.

23:56.020 --> 23:57.689
Not hungry?

23:59.774 --> 24:01.067
I'm sorry.

24:03.570 --> 24:05.947
This time of year makes me think about...

24:06.030 --> 24:07.073
Work?

24:07.782 --> 24:12.162
Yup. I couldn't shut my brain off
hours after clocking out.

24:12.245 --> 24:14.289
Used to infuriate my ex.

24:16.541 --> 24:18.042
How'd you stop?

24:19.335 --> 24:21.379
Years and years of therapy.

24:21.462 --> 24:24.674
Oh, ho, I see.

24:24.757 --> 24:27.218
Should I contact your doctor
for your records?

24:27.302 --> 24:28.887
Might not be a bad idea.

24:28.970 --> 24:30.513
Let you know what you're in for.

24:30.597 --> 24:31.639
Mm.

24:32.098 --> 24:33.141
Ahem.

24:34.851 --> 24:35.894
How was your day?

24:41.983 --> 24:46.029
I was at the grocery store,
and this little girl was staring at me.

24:50.158 --> 24:51.993
And how did that make you feel?

24:54.537 --> 24:56.497
I mean, she was just a little kid, but...

24:57.749 --> 24:59.209
she didn't look away...

25:00.501 --> 25:01.794
and it really got to me.

25:04.672 --> 25:07.425
I mean, I was supposed to be
this new person now, not a...

25:09.219 --> 25:10.511
not a freak.

25:10.595 --> 25:12.305
Well, it's...

25:12.388 --> 25:14.933
better than the alternative, right?

25:15.016 --> 25:17.185
[scoffs]

25:19.896 --> 25:23.274
You know, before the operation,
I didn't leave my house for a year.

25:24.317 --> 25:25.526
You don't have to now.

25:26.361 --> 25:28.821
Deliveries and online shopping.
It was easy.

25:28.905 --> 25:32.617
Lonely, but easy.

25:37.372 --> 25:41.751
I was miserable before I got
on the donor list,

25:41.834 --> 25:46.547
but now, after this change...

25:47.882 --> 25:50.510
I don't know
who I am anymore, and that's...

25:50.969 --> 25:52.553
It's worse.

25:52.637 --> 25:55.682
At least before when I looked
in the mirror, I knew who I was,

25:55.765 --> 26:00.895
and now... it sounds like bad lyrics,
but there's a stranger looking back.

26:03.690 --> 26:07.694
We're going to begin
what's called exposure therapy.

26:10.238 --> 26:12.782
We need to go back
to the night of the accident.

26:15.159 --> 26:17.412
I don't... I don't know if I can.

26:17.495 --> 26:19.289
We'll just start from the beginning.

26:22.250 --> 26:23.918
Very slowly.

26:24.002 --> 26:26.754
[sighs]

26:28.715 --> 26:30.550
I'm not sure how I got there.

26:31.634 --> 26:33.720
What do you remember?

26:36.472 --> 26:39.142
[screaming]

26:39.225 --> 26:41.060
I really don't remember.

26:44.230 --> 26:47.400
Alex, breathe.

26:50.278 --> 26:52.405
Breathe deeply.

26:52.488 --> 26:53.489
Very good.

26:53.573 --> 26:55.867
I want you to place yourself there.

26:55.950 --> 26:58.161
Oh... hmm.

27:02.540 --> 27:04.667
Uh, it was a Thursday.

27:04.751 --> 27:06.878
I was coming home from work, so I...

27:06.961 --> 27:08.921

27:11.049 --> 27:12.717
[Jane] <i>What was the road like?</i>

27:14.594 --> 27:17.889
<i>Was it bumpy or smooth?</i>

27:20.058 --> 27:21.476
[Alex] <i>It was smooth...</i>

27:23.353 --> 27:25.438
<i>like they had just repaved it.</i>

27:28.941 --> 27:30.610
<i>There was glass...</i>

27:32.445 --> 27:33.529
<i>and a... and a bumper.</i>

27:34.530 --> 27:36.157
<i>I-I had to slow down.</i>

It's impossible...</i>

28:05.561 --> 28:06.854
<i>- to put it...</i>
- [horn blaring]

[Alex panting]

28:25.206 --> 28:28.084

28:28.167 --> 28:29.710
- Alex?
- I feel strange. I can't...

28:29.794 --> 28:31.921
I can't do this. I thought...

28:33.089 --> 28:36.217
I thought my life would change, but it...

28:36.300 --> 28:38.636
God, it's... it's gotten worse.

28:38.720 --> 28:40.138
I'm going to get you a glass of water.

28:40.221 --> 28:41.973
At least before, I was me.

28:47.145 --> 28:50.189
Look at me. Look... look at me.
Look at me.

28:50.273 --> 28:54.026
Take a deep breath in.
Deep breath. And out slowly.

28:54.569 --> 28:57.029
Alex. Alex.

29:03.244 --> 29:05.830
Alex. [Clapping] Alex!

29:07.206 --> 29:08.750
Now, nice and easy.

29:11.836 --> 29:13.254
You had a panic attack.

29:15.673 --> 29:16.716
Here.

29:19.010 --> 29:20.845
Let's... let's try something.

29:20.928 --> 29:23.139
Um, it's an exercise.

29:24.182 --> 29:27.185
It's called 478.

29:28.269 --> 29:29.854
So, exhale completely.

29:32.440 --> 29:34.192
Close your mouth.

29:34.275 --> 29:36.194
Now breathe in for four

29:36.277 --> 29:37.361
through your nose.

29:38.237 --> 29:40.448
Hold it for seven,

29:40.531 --> 29:43.201
and then exhale
through your nose for eight.

29:43.409 --> 29:44.494
[exhales abruptly]

29:44.577 --> 29:48.539
[chuckles] I know, I know,
it takes a little getting used to,

29:48.623 --> 29:51.751
but that'll help the next time
this... this happens, okay?

29:51.834 --> 29:53.294
I'm so sorry about this.

29:53.377 --> 29:54.504
No, no, no, no.

29:54.587 --> 29:56.297
You're not the first.

29:56.380 --> 29:58.674
It's a lot of trauma to process.

30:00.468 --> 30:01.636
Same time next week?

30:02.637 --> 30:05.056
Uh, you sure you're okay?

30:05.765 --> 30:09.477
I'm fine. Thanks. I'm sorry.

less extreme cases.

What's wrong with his face?

34:57.264 --> 34:59.308
Oh, it's...

35:01.769 --> 35:03.437
Can you stay tonight?

35:03.521 --> 35:05.231
Of course. Yeah.

35:05.314 --> 35:07.274
Of course I can.

35:07.358 --> 35:10.694
Okay. I'm gonna go talk to him.

35:12.154 --> 35:13.155
Okay.

35:14.156 --> 35:15.783
I'm right over here.

35:35.261 --> 35:37.179
[sighs]

35:43.561 --> 35:46.689
We're going to have
to discontinue our sessions.

35:46.772 --> 35:48.607
I can recommend someone.

35:48.691 --> 35:51.318
It was a mistake.
Please, I was doing so well.

35:51.402 --> 35:53.279
I need this.
You're really helping me.

35:53.362 --> 35:55.239
- Alex.
- Please, I promise.

35:55.322 --> 35:58.534
This will never happen again.
You have to take a chance on me.

36:03.330 --> 36:07.668
You don't understand.
I let my guard down before. I...

36:07.751 --> 36:10.588
I'm... I'm very sorry,
and I promise, I will...

36:10.671 --> 36:13.382
I will do anything...
Anything you ask me.

36:13.465 --> 36:16.135
- Just... Can you stop?
- I know you're the only one who can...

36:17.136 --> 36:18.179
Please.

36:19.972 --> 36:22.558
I can send you a list of recommendations.

You must be Nora.

36:53.130 --> 36:54.173
Come on in.

37:06.477 --> 37:07.519
How, um...

37:09.855 --> 37:11.148
How do I start?

37:12.149 --> 37:13.692
You don't need to be nervous.

37:14.693 --> 37:16.695
This will be easy.

37:17.780 --> 37:19.323
It doesn't seem easy.

37:20.324 --> 37:22.868
If at any point you're uncomfortable,

37:22.952 --> 37:24.411
you can always stop.

37:24.495 --> 37:25.955
You're in control.

37:28.999 --> 37:31.543

I-I-I couldn't breathe for a second.

- You all right?

38:19.633 --> 38:20.676
Yeah.

38:47.661 --> 38:48.787
So, what do you think?

38:50.664 --> 38:53.083
Mm? [Startles]

38:53.167 --> 38:56.128
Um, maybe you should...

38:56.211 --> 38:59.298
I don't think there's any possibility
of me getting ahead in that place.

I just wanted to sleep for a while.

44:16.365 --> 44:17.949
What did you give me?

44:18.784 --> 44:20.744
It's called Naloxone.

44:21.745 --> 44:23.413
I only use it for emergencies.

44:23.497 --> 44:25.457
And you didn't call an ambulance, did you?

44:25.540 --> 44:27.542
- 'Cause I can't afford...
- Don't worry.

44:36.259 --> 44:37.803
Please don't give up on me.

44:50.857 --> 44:53.276
The breathing exercises have been working.

The insomnia is still bad,
but it's better than...

44:58.657 --> 45:00.659
You put up some Christmas decorations.

45:02.411 --> 45:03.870
When I came in, I saw the tree.

Well, then, we need to finish talking

That's okay. Just pause for a moment.

47:23.802 --> 47:26.846
No. This-this isn't helping.

47:26.930 --> 47:29.691
This is... this is a nightmare for me.
I-I kn... I know what happened.

47:29.766 --> 47:31.810
You know because you were told.

47:32.894 --> 47:33.894
Right?

47:36.940 --> 47:38.358
I think you saved them.

47:42.654 --> 47:44.864
And I wish I'd never stopped.

47:44.948 --> 47:46.658
There's nothing you can do about that.

47:46.741 --> 47:48.660
We're not here to regret the past.

47:49.661 --> 47:52.038
I think we're onto something, Alex.

47:53.790 --> 47:55.208
Do you know what PTSD is?

47:57.586 --> 48:01.423
Of course, it's all you hear about
on the news with the cops and soldiers.

48:01.506 --> 48:06.803
Right, there's that, but it can be used
to describe all kinds of traumas.

48:07.804 --> 48:11.850
Assaults, loss of a loved one,
major surgeries...

48:11.933 --> 48:17.063
So, if we can expose the trauma,
we can move past it.

48:17.147 --> 48:21.026
I don't... I don't want
to keep remembering.

[panting]

53:42.472 --> 53:45.642
[birds chirping]

53:45.725 --> 53:47.101
[doctor] We needed the room.

53:47.185 --> 53:48.811
You should've notified me.

53:48.895 --> 53:50.563
Well, you know how this works.

53:50.647 --> 53:52.523
Her next of kin died a year ago.

53:52.607 --> 53:55.568
He was the one footing the bills.
I mean, I'm... I'm not a monster.

53:55.652 --> 53:59.822
I kept her here as long as I could,
but I had to let go of most of my staff,

53:59.906 --> 54:02.492
and Nora showed progress.

54:02.575 --> 54:03.701
She was my patient.

54:03.785 --> 54:06.079
I should've been notified
of her release.

54:06.162 --> 54:08.498
When she left the facility,
she was calm, she was stable.

54:08.581 --> 54:10.458
You mean doped up?

54:10.541 --> 54:12.794
Look, whatever happened
between you two,

54:12.877 --> 54:14.837
the medication had
nothing to do with it.

54:16.047 --> 54:17.423
Where were you keeping her?

54:20.385 --> 54:21.636
Right this way.

54:23.012 --> 54:27.141
This is our quiet room
for our more aggressive patients,

54:27.225 --> 54:29.102
people who might hurt others.

54:31.104 --> 54:33.147
It actually has one of our best views.

54:43.783 --> 54:45.201
How long was she here for?

54:46.619 --> 54:48.121
Twenty-three months.

54:50.665 --> 54:54.293
What are you looking for?
I have other patients.

55:03.511 --> 55:07.348
Like I said, it's the best view
in the building.

55:12.311 --> 55:14.605
You could've pressed charges,
you know.

55:14.689 --> 55:16.691
Might've made things better.

55:18.985 --> 55:20.611
Did you tape your sessions here?

55:20.695 --> 55:23.781
<i>You went to your psychiatrist's office
and assaulted her.</i>

55:23.865 --> 55:25.241
<i>Do you remember doing that?</i>

55:30.747 --> 55:33.416
It wasn't like that. I just, um...

55:38.671 --> 55:40.673
I just wanted to show her what she did.

55:40.757 --> 55:41.758
[doctor sighs]

55:42.633 --> 55:44.385
It's painful, I know, but...

55:44.469 --> 55:45.678
How could you know?

55:46.971 --> 55:48.723
Unless you've been through it.

55:49.766 --> 55:52.101
She told me to confront...

55:53.102 --> 55:55.938
You mean Dr. Mathis.
She told you that.

55:56.022 --> 55:57.273
Yes.

55:57.356 --> 56:01.736
That's curious,
because her notes on your sessions

56:01.819 --> 56:05.823
said that you both agreed
that it was a good idea.

56:05.907 --> 56:06.991
No, I...

56:07.075 --> 56:08.951
I-I didn't know...

56:09.035 --> 56:13.122
Nora, we need to get better
before you can go home.

56:13.206 --> 56:14.791
I'm not the one that's sick.

56:15.875 --> 56:16.876
Nora.

56:16.959 --> 56:20.046
I saw him for the first time,

56:20.129 --> 56:24.133
and when I went to him,
he smiled and put his hand on me.

56:24.217 --> 56:25.384
Nora, listen to me.

56:25.468 --> 56:28.179
- Please stop scratching.
- He grabbed my wrists like he used to,

56:28.262 --> 56:29.597
to hold me down.

56:29.680 --> 56:31.849
Nora. Nora, please listen to me.

56:31.933 --> 56:35.353
- In place so I couldn't fight back.
- Nora, stop!

56:35.436 --> 56:38.272
- He took me to a clearing...
- Stop! Stop!

56:39.190 --> 56:41.025
Room 111! I need help here!

56:41.484 --> 56:43.277
Nora! Nora!

56:43.361 --> 56:44.612
<i>Nora, stop!</i>

56:46.447 --> 56:48.407
That was the last thing
she said about that night.

56:48.491 --> 56:49.992
She never brought it up again.

56:54.497 --> 56:59.293
That night she broke into my office.
She told me I was wrong.

57:00.294 --> 57:02.171
Well, that's part of the job.

57:03.172 --> 57:04.465
She wanted to forget...

57:05.341 --> 57:06.676
and I wouldn't let her.

57:24.193 --> 57:26.195
[Jane] <i>They let her go.</i>

57:26.279 --> 57:28.156
[Miles, over phone]
<i>Who was paying for it?</i>

57:28.239 --> 57:29.407
[Jane] <i>Her dad.</i>

57:30.199 --> 57:31.951
But I just found out that he died.

57:32.034 --> 57:34.036
I didn't even know they were
in contact with each other.

57:34.120 --> 57:36.414
She told me they hadn't spoken
since she was a kid.

57:38.124 --> 57:39.125
[Miles sighs]

57:40.126 --> 57:43.087
<i>We got her description now.
We'll find her.</i>

57:43.171 --> 57:44.297
Okay, thanks.

57:44.380 --> 57:46.841
<i>- If she comes back, don't try to engage.</i>
- [knocking]

57:46.924 --> 57:49.051
Oh, I gotta go. I have a patient.

57:50.261 --> 57:52.221
Okay. Bye.

57:52.305 --> 57:53.347
[beeps]

57:54.557 --> 57:56.976
- Hi, Alex. Come on in.
- Hi. Thank you.

57:57.894 --> 58:00.897
I'm so sorry about that, and...

58:00.980 --> 58:03.065
I'm also sorry about the noise.

58:03.149 --> 58:06.569
Um, look if you want to reschedule,
that's fine with me.

58:06.652 --> 58:08.070
No, it's... No, it's fine.

58:08.154 --> 58:12.074
Is, um, is this... is this about me?

58:12.158 --> 58:13.826
About what I did?

58:15.620 --> 58:16.620
Please.

58:19.624 --> 58:22.084
This isn't about you.

58:23.503 --> 58:28.466
There were a few disturbances,
and it's better to be safe than sorry.

58:28.549 --> 58:30.968
Well, if there's anything
I can do, let me know.

58:33.137 --> 58:35.431
The other patients I have...

58:36.432 --> 58:38.152
I'm not saying
that they don't need my help,

58:38.226 --> 58:41.062
it's just that my area of expertise is...

58:41.145 --> 58:42.522
I-I understand.

58:43.898 --> 58:48.110
It's hard to be something that you're not.

58:55.326 --> 58:57.662
Has your process ever not worked?

59:02.625 --> 59:03.793
I'm sorry, I...

59:07.296 --> 59:11.050
I treated a patient a while ago.

59:14.011 --> 59:16.472
She suffered abuse
for her whole young life.

59:20.101 --> 59:21.894
But she couldn't see who it was.

59:24.981 --> 59:29.652
To her, as a child, he was a monster...

59:30.987 --> 59:32.822
coming into her room...

59:34.156 --> 59:35.866
constantly taking from her.

59:42.331 --> 59:46.627
At some point, we managed
to piece together some memories.

59:48.504 --> 59:49.672
Who was it?

59:51.507 --> 59:52.633
Never got that far.

59:54.051 --> 59:55.386
What was stopping...?

59:55.469 --> 59:57.138
I made a mistake.

59:58.848 --> 01:00:01.309
I relied too heavily on medication,

01:00:01.392 --> 01:00:03.519
and I didn't listen to what she needed.

01:00:07.607 --> 01:00:08.733
I failed her.

01:00:11.736 --> 01:00:13.988
And I'm not going to do that again.

01:00:24.999 --> 01:00:27.084
Let's go back
to the night of the accident.

I couldn't move.

01:02:00.052 --> 01:02:01.971
It didn't bother me.

01:02:02.054 --> 01:02:03.806
You were in shock.

01:02:16.527 --> 01:02:18.362
<i>You might not believe this, but I...</i>

01:02:19.488 --> 01:02:20.740

01:02:27.788 --> 01:02:30.875
<i>I-I kept asking them what happened.</i>

01:02:30.958 --> 01:02:33.002
I don't... I don't know
if they could hear me,

01:02:33.085 --> 01:02:35.504
but I-I needed to know
what happened to...

01:02:43.679 --> 01:02:44.805
To my...

01:02:45.931 --> 01:02:48.476
to my... to my daughter.

01:03:06.202 --> 01:03:08.329
I'm sorry, I-I didn't...

01:03:08.412 --> 01:03:09.872
I didn't know.

01:03:09.955 --> 01:03:11.916

<i>staring at her body.</i>

01:03:15.211 --> 01:03:19.507
I couldn't... I couldn't tell you
about her earlier. It was...

01:03:21.008 --> 01:03:22.843
It was impossible to talk about.

01:03:25.805 --> 01:03:28.641
If I hadn't stopped to help those people,
she'd be alive.

01:03:35.648 --> 01:03:37.608
I can remember it all now.

01:03:39.777 --> 01:03:41.403
So clearly.

01:03:48.410 --> 01:03:51.372
This is the first time
we've confronted your loss.

01:03:54.083 --> 01:03:55.835
This is a huge breakthrough.

01:03:58.003 --> 01:03:59.338
Do you see?

01:03:59.421 --> 01:04:00.631
Do you see that?

01:04:03.759 --> 01:04:05.594
Now, instead of being haunted by it...

01:04:06.595 --> 01:04:08.556
you can learn to live with it.

01:04:10.307 --> 01:04:13.435

Yeah, see, someone's been
messing with your system.

That jump in the timecode there,
that's where you saw the footprints.

And then it picks up a few hours later.
There's nothing in between.

01:08:09.755 --> 01:08:13.217
I was the only one who had access to it.
She must've stolen the code off my desk.

Jane, you have to accept the fact that
you cannot help this woman anymore...

01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:04.725

with Liz and me.

since I've talked to someone, I...

01:10:44.159 --> 01:10:47.746
After our last session, I thought
maybe we were closer than that.

01:10:56.421 --> 01:10:57.756
I am your doctor.

01:10:58.757 --> 01:11:00.342
It's easier for me to do my job

01:11:00.425 --> 01:11:03.136
if we maintain some sort
of distance and boundaries.

01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:05.138
You... Won't happen again.

01:11:11.103 --> 01:11:14.898
Here. Just until things calm down a bit.

01:11:14.982 --> 01:11:17.859
He's a good friend and a very good doctor.

01:11:20.946 --> 01:11:22.072
I'm sorry.

01:13:34.788 --> 01:13:36.123
You were wrong.

01:13:37.833 --> 01:13:39.876
You did this to me.

01:13:41.711 --> 01:13:42.754
[muffled scream]

01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:58.103
Wrong, wrong, wrong!

Wrong!

[shrieking]

01:15:12.511 --> 01:15:14.888

I just wanted to help you!

Why are...?

01:17:09.085 --> 01:17:10.086

01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:18.553
What's that?

01:17:21.181 --> 01:17:22.390
What is that?

01:17:24.517 --> 01:17:27.145
[monitor beeping]

01:17:40.742 --> 01:17:41.742

01:17:42.827 --> 01:17:44.245
<i>Terry.</i>

01:17:44.329 --> 01:17:46.873
<i>Don't be afraid. We just need
to ask you a few questions.</i>

<i>Sure.</i>

01:17:50.835 --> 01:17:52.837

I promise you.</i>

<i>Mathis, Jane.</i>

01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:02.222
<i>Intake session number one.</i>

01:18:06.059 --> 01:18:07.811
Intake...

01:18:07.894 --> 01:18:09.270
This is a mistake.

01:18:10.647 --> 01:18:11.690
Terry.

01:18:12.482 --> 01:18:14.317
Do you know why you're here?

01:18:22.784 --> 01:18:26.204
Nora Green attacked me in my house...

01:18:31.251 --> 01:18:33.086
and I had to defend myself.

01:18:35.505 --> 01:18:38.717
I don't remember much more,
just I f...

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:40.343
I think I was drugged.

01:18:41.386 --> 01:18:43.972
Can you just... can you please
get me out of this thing?

01:18:44.055 --> 01:18:45.306
It's not that easy, Jane.

01:18:45.390 --> 01:18:48.810
You're going to remain here
on a psychiatric hold until your trial.

01:18:54.733 --> 01:18:56.860
This was obvious self-defense.

01:19:01.448 --> 01:19:02.782
Where's Miles?

01:19:02.866 --> 01:19:04.284
He can explain everything.

01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:07.704
Or Clara. Does she know where I am?

01:19:07.787 --> 01:19:09.873
We got your blood tests back.

01:19:15.336 --> 01:19:19.090
I'm sorry, Terry, I didn't tell you.
I've just been so anxious lately.

01:19:20.258 --> 01:19:22.594
Can you please tell me what's going on?

01:19:22.677 --> 01:19:24.929
How long have you been
taking scrips from me?

01:19:28.057 --> 01:19:31.519
Terry, I never meant to hurt you
in any way. I-I don't...

01:19:32.729 --> 01:19:34.731
What would you say to Miles
if he were here?

01:19:36.065 --> 01:19:38.067
What would I...?

01:19:39.736 --> 01:19:41.654
I would ask him for his help.

01:19:42.655 --> 01:19:45.283
He knows what's been happening
between me and Nora.

01:19:50.205 --> 01:19:51.206
What?

01:19:57.879 --> 01:19:59.839
[Terry]
She doesn't need to see that.

01:19:59.923 --> 01:20:02.967
She's my patient now, and, yes...

01:20:03.051 --> 01:20:04.552
Yes, she does.

01:20:07.806 --> 01:20:09.891
[Jane screaming]

01:20:11.226 --> 01:20:12.310

01:20:14.187 --> 01:20:16.356
<i>What did you take? What did you take?</i>

01:20:16.439 --> 01:20:18.399
<i>Come here, come here! Jesus!</i>

01:20:18.483 --> 01:20:19.943
<i>- Look at me!</i>
- No.

01:20:20.026 --> 01:20:21.903
Hey! Hey, what did you take?

01:20:21.986 --> 01:20:23.279
Come on, come on!

01:20:23.363 --> 01:20:24.989
Look at me. Look at me! Come on.

- [screaming]
- [squelch]

01:20:26.825 --> 01:20:30.245
We think he came over to find you
because you weren't picking up your phone.

01:20:30.328 --> 01:20:32.872
Probably to tell you they found Nora.

01:20:34.874 --> 01:20:36.709
No. No.

01:20:36.793 --> 01:20:38.378
She hung herself.

01:20:38.461 --> 01:20:40.380
A couple of days later,
a neighbor came by,

01:20:40.463 --> 01:20:42.966
complained about the smell.

01:20:43.049 --> 01:20:45.802
You were in a drug-induced hysteria,

01:20:45.885 --> 01:20:47.637
- and we're going to figure this out.
- I didn't do this.

01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:49.639
I didn't do this.

01:20:49.722 --> 01:20:52.892
I-I did... I didn't do this.

01:20:52.976 --> 01:20:54.894
You did see this.

01:20:54.978 --> 01:20:57.397
Could I talk to you
just for a minute, please?

01:20:57.480 --> 01:20:58.648
Just for a minute.

01:21:03.194 --> 01:21:06.239
I don't want to make
trouble here, but I can.

01:21:11.911 --> 01:21:13.580
We're going to put you on a regimen.

01:21:13.663 --> 01:21:15.540
I'll consult with Dr. Drummond.

01:21:15.623 --> 01:21:17.458
You help us help you.

01:21:17.542 --> 01:21:19.711
There's some police outside.

01:21:19.794 --> 01:21:21.838
They want to ask you some questions.

01:21:21.921 --> 01:21:22.964
End session.

01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:47.423
I thought we were close.
I thought you felt comfortable.

01:22:48.716 --> 01:22:50.551
I would've helped you, you know?

01:22:51.636 --> 01:22:54.180
I was so excited when you moved home.

01:22:55.974 --> 01:22:57.475
So excited.

01:22:59.227 --> 01:23:01.688
I'm just sorry you did this all yourself.

01:23:04.357 --> 01:23:07.944
[Clara] I know you didn't want
to do this, right?

01:23:08.027 --> 01:23:10.655
I... I have to believe that.

01:23:10.738 --> 01:23:13.658
You... you were scared.

01:23:13.741 --> 01:23:15.493
We're gonna get you out of here.

01:23:17.328 --> 01:23:20.039
At the trial, I'm gonna be
your character witness.

01:23:20.832 --> 01:23:23.793
But I told them, I don't have character.
I'm a psychiatrist.

01:23:25.003 --> 01:23:27.547
It's Christmas in a few days, so I'll...

01:23:29.298 --> 01:23:31.092
I'll try to come visit.

01:25:11.776 --> 01:25:13.402
You have nothing to say?

01:25:17.406 --> 01:25:19.200
I want to be let out.

01:25:20.451 --> 01:25:21.661
I don't belong here.

01:25:21.744 --> 01:25:23.871
You killed a police officer.
Would you rather be in jail?

01:25:23.955 --> 01:25:25.665
Someone did this to me.

01:25:27.375 --> 01:25:29.043
All of this.

01:25:29.127 --> 01:25:32.004
Nora, you mean, or Nora's ghost?

01:25:34.006 --> 01:25:37.009
This isn't what we're here for,
but I'm gonna humor you.

01:25:37.093 --> 01:25:41.430
Nora Green, who was dead
by the time you turned homicidal,

01:25:41.514 --> 01:25:45.434
broke into your house,
injected you with a drug cocktail,

01:25:45.518 --> 01:25:49.063
left, hung herself, and decayed.

01:25:50.064 --> 01:25:51.774
Do you belittle all your patients?

01:25:51.858 --> 01:25:54.735
No, no, no, I'm just trying
to make you understand

01:25:54.819 --> 01:25:56.237
so that we can start your therapy.

01:25:56.320 --> 01:26:00.783
Isn't that what you do,
the, uh, confrontation technique?

I help people by...

01:26:02.326 --> 01:26:04.203
By breaking their sanity.

01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:07.165
You help no one.

01:26:07.248 --> 01:26:10.501
Nora's reality was so distorted
by the time she got here,

01:26:10.585 --> 01:26:13.588
she couldn't tell the difference
between what was real and what wasn't.

01:26:13.671 --> 01:26:16.299
She was convinced her father was dead,

01:26:16.382 --> 01:26:18.926
and the entire time I'm sitting there,
looking at this girl,

01:26:19.010 --> 01:26:21.637
feeling so bad that
she's being manipulated by...

01:26:25.224 --> 01:26:27.643
an unstable physician.

01:26:30.313 --> 01:26:31.439

01:26:32.565 --> 01:26:33.858
You don't help anyone.

01:26:33.941 --> 01:26:36.819
No. The part about her father.

01:26:36.903 --> 01:26:38.946
She had talked
about how she killed her father,

01:26:39.030 --> 01:26:40.865
even though I spoke to him.

01:26:40.948 --> 01:26:43.993
He was paying the bills
in this facility the entire time.

01:26:44.076 --> 01:26:46.579
What did she say she did to him?

01:26:46.662 --> 01:26:48.039
That's not important.

01:26:52.210 --> 01:26:53.711
His face?

01:26:56.464 --> 01:26:57.548
How would you know that?

01:26:59.050 --> 01:27:00.468
Don't do it!

01:27:00.551 --> 01:27:01.719
Don't do it.

01:27:02.762 --> 01:27:04.430
Unlock me.

01:27:04.513 --> 01:27:06.057
Take a breath.

01:28:23.467 --> 01:28:26.470
[man whistling]

01:28:41.485 --> 01:28:43.237
Open your eyes.

01:28:44.947 --> 01:28:47.074
It's time for some
confrontation therapy.

01:28:54.749 --> 01:28:55.958
Surprise.

01:28:56.042 --> 01:28:57.043
[small chuckle]

01:28:59.045 --> 01:29:00.921
I've been trying to find a way...

01:29:01.922 --> 01:29:04.508
to sneak you out of that place.

01:29:04.592 --> 01:29:08.179
Sitting in that parking lot
every day, and...

01:29:08.262 --> 01:29:09.930
[chuckles]

01:29:10.014 --> 01:29:12.183
You come running out!

01:29:13.851 --> 01:29:15.978
It was a Christmas miracle!

01:29:17.021 --> 01:29:18.564
Why are you doing this?

01:29:18.647 --> 01:29:20.691
You forced your way into our lives.

01:29:21.859 --> 01:29:23.235
Poisoned her.

01:29:24.987 --> 01:29:27.031
She was perfect.

01:29:28.741 --> 01:29:29.741
Tell me...

01:29:32.495 --> 01:29:34.455
I want to understand.

01:29:34.538 --> 01:29:36.624
You couldn't possibly understand.

01:29:38.125 --> 01:29:40.336
You don't allow yourself to feel.

01:29:41.504 --> 01:29:42.922
I've been watching you.

01:29:43.631 --> 01:29:47.426
The pills. The isolation.

01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:49.637
Keeping everyone at arm's length.

01:29:51.597 --> 01:29:52.640
I don't.

01:29:56.310 --> 01:29:57.686
I love Miles.

01:29:57.770 --> 01:30:01.232
[laughs]

01:30:01.315 --> 01:30:02.315
Of course you did.

01:30:02.358 --> 01:30:04.151
He knew exactly what was going on.

01:30:04.235 --> 01:30:05.653
That's why he's alive.

01:30:05.736 --> 01:30:07.446
[Jane sobs]

01:30:07.530 --> 01:30:09.949
Or your... your... your best friend.

01:30:10.032 --> 01:30:12.034
She just wanted you to open up.

01:30:12.118 --> 01:30:14.161
- [Jane sobs]
- Mmm.

01:30:14.245 --> 01:30:15.871
And Terry?

01:30:17.123 --> 01:30:21.961
A guy you pay to sit in a room
and reveal nothing.

01:30:22.795 --> 01:30:25.047
You had no problem talking
to me about Nora.

01:30:27.925 --> 01:30:29.260
We were happy.

01:30:31.470 --> 01:30:33.347
Happier than you've ever been.

01:30:33.848 --> 01:30:36.225
You're right. I'm a mess.

01:30:36.308 --> 01:30:37.309
Yeah.

01:30:39.770 --> 01:30:42.481
When my parents died,
I was young.

01:30:42.565 --> 01:30:46.110
I was alone,
and I ran from this house.

01:30:49.572 --> 01:30:52.283
Trying to be
what they would have wanted.

01:30:53.576 --> 01:30:55.536
But you failed.

01:30:55.619 --> 01:30:58.998
Just like you failed to keep your hands
off your own flesh and blood!

01:31:00.291 --> 01:31:01.584
[Jane groans]

01:31:03.627 --> 01:31:05.588
Can't help who you love, Jane.

01:31:07.798 --> 01:31:08.716
Stay put.

01:31:08.799 --> 01:31:10.217
Enjoy the view.

01:31:20.144 --> 01:31:21.770
[distant clatter]

01:31:21.854 --> 01:31:24.481
[soft groan]

01:31:26.442 --> 01:31:27.610
[sharp gasp]

01:31:34.366 --> 01:31:36.202
[Jane gasps]

01:31:36.285 --> 01:31:39.538
[Alex whistling "Winter Wonderland"]

01:31:46.837 --> 01:31:48.130
[Jane gasps]

01:31:49.423 --> 01:31:52.760
[whistling continues]

01:32:13.239 --> 01:32:14.865
[soft cry]

01:32:17.326 --> 01:32:19.161
[cries out]

01:32:19.245 --> 01:32:22.289
[groans]

01:32:22.373 --> 01:32:23.874
All this to punish me?

01:32:26.669 --> 01:32:28.879
You needed a lesson
in accountability.

01:32:29.964 --> 01:32:31.465
[Nora] <i>Dr. Mathis?</i>

01:32:42.768 --> 01:32:45.062
[Alex] <i>I stopped paying</i>
<i>her insurance payments.</i>

01:32:46.063 --> 01:32:48.190
<i>Filed my own death certificate.</i>

01:32:48.274 --> 01:32:50.150
<i>Changed my name. It was easy.</i>

01:32:50.234 --> 01:32:51.235
Lonely.

01:32:52.820 --> 01:32:53.821
But easy.

01:33:29.523 --> 01:33:31.108
[Alex] <i>Tell me something.</i>

01:33:31.191 --> 01:33:32.735
<i>What did you see...</i>

01:33:33.736 --> 01:33:36.155
<i>the night you slashed up your boyfriend?</i>

01:33:37.740 --> 01:33:38.991
[Jane] <i>I saw Nora.</i>

01:33:39.074 --> 01:33:41.785
[Alex laughing]

01:33:41.869 --> 01:33:43.495
That's perfect.

01:33:45.956 --> 01:33:47.833
I saw what you made of her.

01:33:47.916 --> 01:33:50.044
[pained gasp]

01:33:50.127 --> 01:33:52.046
I loved her.

01:33:52.546 --> 01:33:54.465
More than any father could.

01:33:54.548 --> 01:33:57.343
[pained gasps]

01:34:01.597 --> 01:34:03.223
God.

01:34:04.767 --> 01:34:07.436
There was no car accident,
was there?

01:34:07.519 --> 01:34:09.772
There was, actually.

01:34:11.982 --> 01:34:12.983
<i>Funny story.</i>

01:34:13.525 --> 01:34:14.360
<i>[soft chuckle]</i>

01:34:14.443 --> 01:34:16.570
<i>I couldn't tell the hospital the truth.</i>

01:34:16.653 --> 01:34:19.656
<i>They would ask too many questions.</i>

01:34:19.740 --> 01:34:21.700
Fucking bitch!

01:34:21.784 --> 01:34:22.784
<i>They wouldn't understand.</i>

01:34:22.826 --> 01:34:24.161
[frustrated groan]

01:34:24.244 --> 01:34:29.208
[horn blaring]

01:34:31.168 --> 01:34:33.170
That's why they put you
on the donor list.

01:34:33.253 --> 01:34:34.463
Ding!

01:34:35.964 --> 01:34:37.174
Now, tell me...

01:34:39.176 --> 01:34:42.513
all the time we had together,
there must have been...

01:34:42.596 --> 01:34:44.223
something real.

01:34:45.391 --> 01:34:47.601
Some part of you that wanted
to confide in me.

01:34:47.684 --> 01:34:51.605
[laughing]

01:34:52.481 --> 01:34:53.690
Ah.

01:34:59.196 --> 01:35:01.323
That little girl in the grocery store.

01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:05.869
That wasn't the first time
you felt like a freak.

01:35:09.456 --> 01:35:11.083
It's not about your face.

01:35:14.962 --> 01:35:17.756
You've been this way
for a long time.

01:35:17.840 --> 01:35:19.842
Who hurt you, Alex?

01:35:19.925 --> 01:35:21.343
Who hurt you so badly

01:35:21.427 --> 01:35:24.430
that you couldn't stop yourself
from hurting Nora, too?

01:35:27.182 --> 01:35:28.725
I can help you.

01:35:28.809 --> 01:35:31.061
I can make you feel normal again.

01:35:33.313 --> 01:35:34.982
Let me help you.

01:35:36.316 --> 01:35:37.609
What happened to you?

01:35:37.693 --> 01:35:38.693
[Alex screams]

01:35:39.111 --> 01:35:41.697

Ohh!

01:36:34.708 --> 01:36:36.126
[door rattles]

01:36:38.128 --> 01:36:39.588
Terry was first.

01:36:40.672 --> 01:36:43.091
He died of a heart attack
midway through.

01:36:43.175 --> 01:36:44.468
[chuckles]

01:36:44.551 --> 01:36:46.720
But I learned a lot from Clara.

01:36:47.721 --> 01:36:49.431
And you're next.

01:36:49.515 --> 01:36:51.517
[Jane panting]

01:36:54.269 --> 01:36:55.729
[Alex grunts]

01:36:55.812 --> 01:36:57.689
What are you doing in there?

01:36:57.773 --> 01:36:59.816
Taking more pills?

01:37:01.568 --> 01:37:03.779
Taking more medication...

01:37:03.862 --> 01:37:05.364
[pounding]

01:37:05.447 --> 01:37:07.074
To help you forget?

01:37:25.008 --> 01:37:27.052
[Jane cries out]
