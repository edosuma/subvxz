- There you go.

square...

12:10.416 --> 12:12.383
then you can buy me a drink, how
about that?

12:12.385 --> 12:14.252
I don't see what the difference
two bucks makes, man.

12:14.254 --> 12:15.920
Andy, he doesn't want the drink.

12:15.922 --> 12:17.489
Hey, Scotty, shut the fuck up,
I'm not talking to you.

12:17.491 --> 12:19.791
Hey, hey, guys, just calm it
down, all right?

12:19.793 --> 12:21.260
I'll take it.

12:21.262 --> 12:24.997
No, you're not taking a drink,
buy your own fucking drink.

12:24.999 --> 12:26.368
Take the drink.

12:28.101 --> 12:30.902
You bought a truck.

12:30.904 --> 12:35.006
Yeah, yeah, the old one was
falling apart.

12:35.008 --> 12:36.309
It's a brand-new truck.

12:36.311 --> 12:37.878
Johnny, I'm a contractor.

12:37.880 --> 12:39.445
How am I supposed to work
without a new truck?

12:39.447 --> 12:43.215
If I can't work, I can't pay
you.

12:43.217 --> 12:46.253
And I got a good deal.

12:46.255 --> 12:47.820
What are you, my accountant?

12:47.822 --> 12:50.860
No, I just don't want
your fucking drink.

12:53.327 --> 12:55.561
Fine. Fine.

12:55.563 --> 12:59.202
You know what, don't take
my fucking drink.

13:01.270 --> 13:03.070
Whoa! Fuck.

13:03.072 --> 13:05.105
I'm leaving, I'm leaving,
I know. I know. I know.

13:05.107 --> 13:07.508
You should have taken the
fucking drink, douche bag.

13:07.510 --> 13:10.344
It was as simple as that.
I was trying to be a nice guy.

13:10.346 --> 13:11.845
Fuck off!

13:11.847 --> 13:14.916
Zibs, I'm sorry, man, you all
right?

13:14.918 --> 13:17.018
Aw, that guy is such a dick,
I'm sorry, man.

13:17.020 --> 13:20.454
Yeah... shit.

13:20.456 --> 13:24.025
Listen, I wanted to talk to you
about something, anyway.

13:24.027 --> 13:26.995
Um, I was wondering
if maybe you could...

13:26.997 --> 13:29.501
uh, maybe not come in here
for awhile.

13:31.502 --> 13:33.367
I get punched in the face...

13:33.369 --> 13:35.370
and you're kicking <i>me</i> out
of the bar?

13:35.372 --> 13:37.405
No, it's just that I got a kid,
you know...

13:37.407 --> 13:39.841
and everyone in town owes
you money...

13:39.843 --> 13:41.577
and you know, everyone knows
you come in here...

13:41.579 --> 13:43.144
and if they're avoiding you...

13:43.146 --> 13:45.282
then they ain't coming in here,
you know.

13:47.185 --> 13:48.318
Fuck you, Petey.

13:48.320 --> 13:49.852
No, let me buy you a round,
okay?

13:49.854 --> 13:51.956
JOHN: I don't want your fucking
drinks, neither.

13:57.528 --> 13:59.431
That's ten grand.

14:02.334 --> 14:04.534
It's only money.

14:04.536 --> 14:08.007
Tide comes in, tide goes out.

14:17.483 --> 14:20.450
Is that Debbie Houston?

14:20.452 --> 14:22.619
Yeah, she works here.

14:22.621 --> 14:26.323
We messed around in high school.

14:26.325 --> 14:30.194
You know she married Hooper? Had
a kid together.

14:30.196 --> 14:33.030
Just got divorced a little while
back.

14:33.032 --> 14:35.300
Man, she used to party, man.

14:35.302 --> 14:38.538
Shit, looks like she still does.

14:44.211 --> 14:49.580
Is that John Zbikowski?

14:49.582 --> 14:51.918
And fucking Scotty?

14:54.053 --> 14:57.656
I haven't seen you since
high school.

14:57.658 --> 15:01.560
Do you remember me,
Debbie Houston?

15:01.562 --> 15:03.999
We fucked, you better.

15:04.933 --> 15:07.933
- Buy me a drink.
- Fine.

15:07.935 --> 15:12.039
Wally, three whiskey shots,
right here.

15:14.107 --> 15:16.942
So what are you two up to?

15:16.944 --> 15:20.546
You were really good
at baseball, right?

15:20.548 --> 15:23.616
Yeah, I was okay.

15:23.618 --> 15:26.285
- Weren't you drafted?
- Yup.

15:26.287 --> 15:28.187
What happened?

15:28.189 --> 15:30.222
I had this thing with my arm.

15:30.224 --> 15:32.591
No, to your face?

15:32.593 --> 15:35.562
Oh, I got punched.

15:35.564 --> 15:38.197
I can see that, why?

15:38.199 --> 15:41.168
Somebody owed me money.

15:41.170 --> 15:45.338
Somebody owed you money and
<i>you</i> got punched in the face?

15:45.340 --> 15:47.541
Yep.

15:47.543 --> 15:50.078
I'd love to owe you money.

15:50.080 --> 15:51.949
Get in line.

15:53.215 --> 15:55.418
To owing you money.

16:01.758 --> 16:04.961
Time really did a number on us,
didn't it?

16:08.465 --> 16:10.700
Would you still fuck me?

16:40.664 --> 16:43.535
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:58.183 --> 17:01.485
Hey, you know if you have
any coffee?

17:01.487 --> 17:02.820
Nope.

17:02.822 --> 17:04.554
Nope, you don't have any
coffee...

17:04.556 --> 17:06.489
or nope, you don't know
if you have any coffee?

17:06.491 --> 17:08.358
Nope, I don't know
if we have any.

17:08.361 --> 17:09.592
All right, fair enough.

17:09.594 --> 17:12.561
Are you friends with my mom?

17:12.564 --> 17:15.800
We went to high school together.

17:15.801 --> 17:17.467
Oh.

17:17.469 --> 17:20.570
- You know where she is?
- Work.

17:20.573 --> 17:23.507
She just leaves you by yourself?

17:23.509 --> 17:25.576
My grandmom comes over
sometimes.

17:25.578 --> 17:27.580
Is this one of those times?

17:31.517 --> 17:34.351
Are you allowed to stay home by
herself?

17:34.353 --> 17:35.620
I think so.

17:35.622 --> 17:37.656
- How old are you?
- 12.

17:37.658 --> 17:40.257
That's a gray area.

17:40.259 --> 17:41.826
Can we call her?

17:41.828 --> 17:46.130
When she's at work I can only
call her if it's an emergency.

17:46.132 --> 17:47.266
Just an emergency?

17:47.268 --> 17:49.267
Only if I'm bleeding.

17:49.269 --> 17:51.771
Shit, man.

17:51.773 --> 17:53.872
All right, look, okay,
I'm gonna be honest with you.

17:53.874 --> 17:56.208
I have no idea if I told your
mom that I was gonna watch...

17:56.210 --> 17:59.781
you or not, so what do you think
we should do here?

18:05.487 --> 18:07.519
So what? You go to school?

18:07.521 --> 18:10.523
- Yep.
- Good.

18:10.525 --> 18:12.526
Well, we're done for the summer.

18:12.528 --> 18:15.595
Oh right, yeah.

18:15.597 --> 18:16.729
What are you gonna do
with yourself?

18:16.731 --> 18:18.498
I don't know.

18:18.500 --> 18:20.467
Might want to figure that out
before school starts back up.

18:20.469 --> 18:26.472
Yeah, I play baseball.

18:26.474 --> 18:28.674
- At Dundalk?
- Yep.

18:28.676 --> 18:30.410
You any good?

18:30.412 --> 18:32.778
I'm gonna play pro one day.

20:29.669 --> 20:31.936
You sure you don't want this?

20:31.938 --> 20:36.341
You hold onto it for me. Think
of it as hush money.

20:36.343 --> 20:38.278
What does that mean?

20:38.280 --> 20:41.546
It means you gotta promise not
to tell anyone how we got this.

20:41.548 --> 20:42.682
Can you do that?

20:42.684 --> 20:44.283
Sure.

20:44.285 --> 20:46.985
Promise me you are not going
to tell your friends.

20:46.987 --> 20:50.555
- I promise.
- Okay, good.

20:50.557 --> 20:52.425
What should I tell my mom?

20:52.427 --> 20:54.860
Tell her I got a new one
and gave you my old one.

20:54.862 --> 20:56.462
But this is a brand-new TV.

20:56.464 --> 20:57.696
Kid, do you want the TV or not?

20:57.698 --> 20:59.399
- I want it.
- All right.

20:59.401 --> 21:02.271
Then figure something out,
just don't tell her we stole it.

21:03.471 --> 21:08.374
I got a game tomorrow at 5:00,
if you want to come.

pitch.

21:12.614 --> 21:15.815
Hmm. You ever pitched before?

21:15.817 --> 21:19.620

No, no kids.

Yeah, I figured.

I would have recognized your
name from the roster sheet.

Yeah, we send out roster sheets
to all the parents...

something about that.

27:57.937 --> 28:00.002
So you know all these
players pretty well.

28:00.004 --> 28:01.370
Sure.

28:01.372 --> 28:03.406
All right, tomorrow,
Eagle-Spartans, who wins?

28:03.408 --> 28:06.143
Eagles easily, Ryan Hosfeld
is pitching.

28:06.145 --> 28:07.277
And the Spartans aren't very
good?

28:07.279 --> 28:08.811
Not really.

28:08.813 --> 28:10.415
All right, how many runs you
think they'll win by?

28:10.417 --> 28:13.118
Well, they played earlier this
season and they won by four...

28:13.120 --> 28:15.986
but that was without Hosfeld
on the mound.

28:15.988 --> 28:17.288
So maybe six or seven.

28:17.290 --> 28:19.960
- Yup. Why?
- All right.

28:21.294 --> 28:23.964
Honey, where are you?

28:24.995 --> 28:28.500
Come give Mommy a kiss before
she has to go to her other job.

28:28.502 --> 28:31.002
Why the fuck are you
in my house?

28:31.004 --> 28:33.772
John came to see my game today.
Give me a ride home.

28:33.774 --> 28:37.443
Yeah, okay, fine, I can't deal
with this right now, I'm late.

28:37.445 --> 28:40.182
Go wash up for supper.

28:45.318 --> 28:48.853
What's going on here?

28:48.855 --> 28:50.188
What, it's like the kid said.

28:50.190 --> 28:52.257
Do I have to call the cops?

28:52.259 --> 28:54.059
No, why would you call the cops?

28:54.061 --> 28:56.795
Because you're an adult alone
with a child...

28:56.797 --> 28:59.865
and somehow there's a new TV
in my house.

28:59.867 --> 29:02.502
Well, I had an extra TV, yours
was shit.

29:02.504 --> 29:04.504
Isn't that sweet?

29:04.506 --> 29:07.207
You know, the kid asked
me to come see his game.

29:07.209 --> 29:09.208
I gave him a ride home,
what's the big deal?

29:09.210 --> 29:10.877
That's so nice.

29:10.879 --> 29:12.946
Do you give all the kids rides
home or just the cute ones?

29:12.948 --> 29:15.447
Oh, for Fuck's sake, no! I told
him I'd help him pitch.

29:15.449 --> 29:18.552
Remember, I was good at baseball
in high school.

29:18.554 --> 29:22.823
Look, if this is something else,
I'm gonna find some dude...

29:22.825 --> 29:26.893
some big motherfucker to pin you
down and fuck you...

29:26.895 --> 29:31.833
right in your ass, some dude
with a giant cock.

29:31.835 --> 29:34.134
- We're clear?
- Yeah, Christ...

29:34.136 --> 29:35.503
we're fucking clear, man.

29:35.505 --> 29:37.304
What are you guys talking about?

29:37.306 --> 29:40.309
Just some grown-up stuff, honey.

29:46.181 --> 29:50.318
JOHN (V.O.): <i>How did that guy
come up with the light bulb?</i>

29:50.320 --> 29:53.521
<i>I'm not sure, I'll bet
he was walking around...</i>

29:53.523 --> 29:56.525
<i>in the dark looking
for something.</i>

29:56.527 --> 30:01.865
<i>You know, probably came out
of necessity.</i>

30:04.268 --> 30:07.401
Hey, you remember Matt Smith.

30:07.403 --> 30:08.970
- You mean Smitty?
- Yeah.

30:08.972 --> 30:11.341
Yeah, he's got his face on those
election posters.

30:11.343 --> 30:12.408
He's running for...

30:12.410 --> 30:13.876
- City council.
- Yeah.

30:13.878 --> 30:16.112
Yeah, so I see him over
at Dundalk Field, right?

30:16.114 --> 30:19.047
And he's got this great job
and this hot-ass wife.

30:19.049 --> 30:21.284
I don't know, man, I just
fucking hate him for it.

30:21.286 --> 30:22.618
Yeah, fuck him.

30:22.620 --> 30:24.519
Anyway, I see all these parents
there...

30:24.521 --> 30:25.954
and they're really into the
games...

30:25.956 --> 30:27.624
and I noticed a lot of these
parents...

30:27.626 --> 30:29.291
are parents who bet through me
and I'm thinking...

30:29.293 --> 30:32.027
why not put some lines out?

30:32.029 --> 30:34.999
You're gonna take bets
on little league games.

30:35.001 --> 30:37.334
Yeah, people are gonna settle up
with me...

30:37.336 --> 30:39.936
because they're gonna want to
put action on their kids' games.

30:39.938 --> 30:42.038
I don't know.

30:42.040 --> 30:44.674
It's like opening a horse track
in our backyards.

30:44.676 --> 30:46.644
Yeah, but it feels just wrong.

30:46.646 --> 30:49.613
Scotty, just think about it
for a second...

30:49.615 --> 30:52.449
what's the worst thing
a person can do?

30:52.451 --> 30:54.084
Murder someone?

30:54.086 --> 30:56.185
Bet with their hearts.

30:56.187 --> 30:59.324
I got a whole stable of betters
who will bet on their kids...

30:59.326 --> 31:01.660
regardless of what I set
the lines at.

31:01.662 --> 31:03.962
Plus, the internet can't
touch me.

31:03.964 --> 31:06.263
So you really think people are
gonna want to bet...

31:06.265 --> 31:08.199
on little league baseball games?

31:08.201 --> 31:13.341
I got Boston plus five, $192.
OKC plus three, $186.

31:14.640 --> 31:15.574
Okay.

31:15.576 --> 31:19.978
Hey, uh, you got a kid
at Dundalk right now?

31:19.980 --> 31:23.182
Yeah, I've got that line,
if you want it.

31:23.184 --> 31:26.484
Eagles are minus six.

31:26.486 --> 31:28.386
Yeah, Hosfeld's on the mound.

31:28.388 --> 31:30.993
Hey, I know it's high, man,
but the kid can pitch.

31:32.493 --> 31:34.627
You want the Spartans?
All right.

31:34.629 --> 31:37.165
Gotcha, Gordy, duly noted.

games ain't hard.</i>

31:53.983 --> 31:57.149
<i>Big kids beat up little kids.</i>

31:57.151 --> 31:59.418
<i>You find the team with the
bigger kid on the mound...</i>

31:59.420 --> 32:02.388
<i>that's typically your favorite.</i>

32:02.390 --> 32:04.657
<i>If his dad is coaching, well...</i>

32:04.659 --> 32:07.194
<i>that's a good sign he can play,
as well.</i>

32:07.196 --> 32:09.262
<i>And if his old man is watching
every pitch...</i>

32:09.264 --> 32:12.000
<i>like it's game seven of the
World Series...</i>

32:12.002 --> 32:15.136
Come on, keep your shoulder
in there, over the top!

32:15.138 --> 32:17.605
JOHN (V.O.): <i>That's an even
bigger indication...</i>

32:17.607 --> 32:21.208
<i>that the kid is practicing
fundamentals at home.</i>

32:21.210 --> 32:26.414
<i>Fundamentals and mechanics,
they're the great equalizers.</i>

32:26.416 --> 32:31.252
<i>Balance, rotation, arm angle,
tempo, smooth first step.</i>

32:31.254 --> 32:36.324
<i>That shit can be taught and
they can give you an advantage.</i>

32:36.326 --> 32:39.261
<i>It's usually that simple.</i>

32:39.263 --> 32:42.031
<i>Now some people will try to
complicate things...</i>

they think can sway games.</i>

32:45.769 --> 32:47.636

32:47.638 --> 32:50.272

dog died last week...

32:50.274 --> 32:52.408
and he can't get over it.

32:52.410 --> 32:54.776
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

32:54.778 --> 32:57.045
And their best players,
the Santoro twins?

32:57.047 --> 32:59.448
I heard the parents are getting
a divorce...

32:59.450 --> 33:01.120
and they just told them
about it.

33:03.454 --> 33:06.523
JOHN (V.O.): <i>It's usually because they
don't understand the beautiful...</i>

33:06.525 --> 33:10.662
<i>simplicity and purity
of baseball.</i>

33:19.671 --> 33:23.340
Whoo-hoo! Christmas came early.

33:23.342 --> 33:26.343
A lot of guys came through this
week to drop off envelopes.

33:26.345 --> 33:28.578
A bunch of them I haven't seen
in months.

33:28.580 --> 33:31.217
Snips, what do you say, buddy?

33:47.634 --> 33:49.103
There you go.

33:53.240 --> 33:54.608
It's all there.

33:57.344 --> 33:58.509
Buy you a beer?

33:58.511 --> 34:01.479
No, I got to run.

34:01.481 --> 34:03.216
You got them Dundalk lines yet?

34:09.388 --> 34:10.822
Yeah, I'll take a beer.

34:10.824 --> 34:12.657
We don't tell beer, sir.

34:12.659 --> 34:14.793
Oh, well, uh, give me a Coke.

34:14.795 --> 34:18.166
Okay, one Coke coming right up.

34:37.351 --> 34:39.418
- Zibs.
- Smitty.

34:39.420 --> 34:41.821
It's a pretty good turnout,
wouldn't you say?

34:41.822 --> 34:43.623
- Most definitely.
- It's funny...

34:43.626 --> 34:45.424
I don't recognize half the
people here.

34:45.426 --> 34:48.527
I just ran into Adam Kramer. I
didn't know the guy's got kids.

34:48.530 --> 34:49.831
He doesn't.

game.

on the game?

Nothing... just an asshole.

35:30.675 --> 35:32.307
Strike!

So Andy Fox comes in to Jolyn's
today, pays me, in full.

35:36.479 --> 35:40.883
Wow. I guess your face really
taught his fist a lesson, huh?

35:40.885 --> 35:42.484
Here's the thing, though.

35:42.486 --> 35:44.919
Now he wants action
on today's game.

35:44.921 --> 35:46.790
Sure he does, his boy is
pitching.

35:46.792 --> 35:49.728
He didn't want to bet
on his boy.

35:52.297 --> 35:54.630
He wants to bet on the other
team.

35:54.632 --> 35:55.898
You told him to go fuck himself,
right?

35:55.900 --> 35:58.902
No. I told him, "Duly noted,
Andy."

35:58.904 --> 36:02.272
You crazy? He's gonna throw
the game.

36:02.274 --> 36:03.409
I know that.

Now this is important,
look at me.

40:27.783 --> 40:30.750
First batter you face, I want
you to throw it at him.

40:30.752 --> 40:32.252
You want me to hit a kid.

40:32.254 --> 40:35.523
- Naw, he'll get out of the way.
- What if he doesn't?

40:35.525 --> 40:37.157
That's why you wear helmets.

40:37.159 --> 40:41.061
Look, this is your plate, okay?
You own it.

40:41.063 --> 40:42.796
You brush that first
kid back a little.

40:42.798 --> 40:44.798
You're gonna send a message
to the rest of the team...

40:44.800 --> 40:46.267
not to get too close.

40:46.269 --> 40:48.702
Then you're gonna be inside
their heads...

40:48.704 --> 40:50.005
and that's the most
important part of pitching.

40:50.007 --> 40:51.539
More important than
throwing?

40:51.541 --> 40:55.543
Let's just say "yes".
Give me the ball.

40:55.545 --> 40:58.013
All right?

40:58.015 --> 41:00.815
Right there. That's how
I want you to hold it, okay?

41:00.817 --> 41:02.685
That's your grip, all right?

41:02.687 --> 41:05.754
Your arm angle, it's kind of
like you're throwing a football.

41:05.756 --> 41:07.790
- Like this?
- There you go, that's right.

41:07.792 --> 41:10.292
When you follow through,
flick it with your wrist.

41:10.294 --> 41:11.826
Isn't that a curveball?

41:11.828 --> 41:13.828
Yeah, man, it's your bread
and butter.

41:13.830 --> 41:16.665
But I'm 12, I'm not supposed
to throw curve balls.

41:16.667 --> 41:18.000
Who told you that?

41:18.002 --> 41:20.136
Everyone tells kids that,
it'll mess up your arm.

41:20.138 --> 41:21.938
Oh, my god, all right,
here's the harsh truth.

41:21.940 --> 41:25.074
You're never going to
play professional baseball.

41:25.076 --> 41:26.577
Wait, look, here's the good
news...

41:26.579 --> 41:28.177
neither is anyone else
in this league.

41:28.179 --> 41:31.213
- Not even Ryan Hosfeld?
- No, not even Ryan Hosfeld.

41:31.215 --> 41:34.117
You know, and another hard
truth, next year you turn 13...

41:34.119 --> 41:35.619
they're gonna move you
to the big field.

41:35.621 --> 41:37.688
Now you can barely
get that ball over now.

41:37.690 --> 41:39.690
What do you think the odds are
you get it over next year?

41:39.692 --> 41:42.124
- Not good?
- That's right, not good.

41:42.126 --> 41:44.998
If you want to pitch,
you gotta throw the curve, kid.

41:46.865 --> 41:49.569
I hold it like this?

41:55.609 --> 41:59.145
What are you doing, practicing
sitting on the bench?

42:04.283 --> 42:06.283
- What was that about?
- Nothing.

42:06.285 --> 42:08.752
Didn't look like nothing to me.

42:08.754 --> 42:12.023
That's Brett and Abe, they're
on my team, they're dicks.

42:12.025 --> 42:15.393
You know what you gotta do,
you gotta shut them up.

42:15.395 --> 42:17.029
No, I'm not worried about it.

42:17.031 --> 42:19.697
- What are you afraid of?
- Getting my teeth kicked in?

42:19.699 --> 42:21.065
All right, first of all,
they're your baby teeth.

42:21.067 --> 42:22.668
- But...
- Okay? You're gonna get...

42:22.670 --> 42:24.168
a whole, new set of teeth,
you're playing with house money.

42:24.170 --> 42:25.804
But these are my adult teeth.

42:25.806 --> 42:27.405
- Really?
- Yeah.

42:27.407 --> 42:29.375
And I don't want to get punched
in the face.

42:29.377 --> 42:34.647
Look at me, I got punched
in the face, I'm fine.

42:34.649 --> 42:36.649
He's 12 years old, how hard
can he hit?

42:36.651 --> 42:39.051
I don't want to find out and
I don't want to get in trouble.

42:39.053 --> 42:40.854
You're not gonna get in trouble.

42:40.856 --> 42:43.256
Look, here's the things that
grownups never tell you, okay?

42:43.258 --> 42:44.658
Right now, you're a minor.

42:44.660 --> 42:46.292
You can get into as much trouble
as you want.

42:46.294 --> 42:48.861
When you turn 18, it all
goes away.

42:48.863 --> 42:50.330
- Really?
- Yeah, man.

42:50.332 --> 42:52.298
I mean, don't go burning
houses down and shit...

42:52.300 --> 42:55.901
but fighting and stuff,
it's forgivable.

42:55.903 --> 42:57.136
I don't know.

42:57.138 --> 43:00.206
Look at me. Punch his mouth
open.

43:00.208 --> 43:02.842
- What?
- Just hit him, man, lock him up.

43:02.844 --> 43:06.012
I'll break it up before he gets
a shot in on you, okay?

43:06.014 --> 43:08.315
I don't know.

43:08.317 --> 43:10.684
Trust me, all right.

43:10.686 --> 43:12.786
They will know that messing
with Brian Houston...

43:12.788 --> 43:15.723
comes with consequences.

43:15.725 --> 43:17.123
Go get 'em, man.

43:17.125 --> 43:18.692
You're not coming with me?

43:18.694 --> 43:20.161
What's it gonna look like
if I walk over there...

43:20.163 --> 43:21.997
and watch you punch a 12 year
old in the face?

43:21.999 --> 43:23.131
Oh.

43:23.133 --> 43:26.734
Now go, come on.

43:26.736 --> 43:29.037
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait,
come here.

43:29.039 --> 43:30.872
- What?
- How are you going to punch him?

43:30.874 --> 43:32.106
I don't know.

43:32.108 --> 43:34.876
Let me see you throw a punch.

43:34.878 --> 43:37.412
That's not gonna work.
Come on, get it, give it to me.

43:37.414 --> 43:39.414
Gotta use your waist,
your hips...

43:39.416 --> 43:42.283
- My hips?
- Legs, wham, like that.

- Like...
- Put your body into it.

Hey.

44:52.058 --> 44:53.558
He talks funny.

44:53.560 --> 44:55.960
Snips had a stroke a few years
back.

He's all there, he just can't
communicate.

44:57.465 --> 44:59.197

All right, pick a horse.

45:29.897 --> 45:33.332
It's complicated, so just go
with your favorite name for now.

45:33.334 --> 45:35.535
This one... Paid in Full.

45:35.537 --> 45:38.571

Alphons, though.

46:13.176 --> 46:15.243

You made a bet without any
money.

to take you out back...

51:31.508 --> 51:34.374
You've gotta break up with both.

51:34.376 --> 51:35.709
Come on, man.

51:35.711 --> 51:39.414
Remember Nicole Nvargia?

51:39.416 --> 51:40.914
Yeah.

51:40.916 --> 51:42.483
I stayed with her
for two years...

51:42.485 --> 51:45.920
because I couldn't say goodbye
to her kids.

51:45.922 --> 51:49.424
Those were good kids, though.

51:49.426 --> 51:52.860
So you're saying, if I want to
hang out with a kid...

51:52.862 --> 51:54.899
Then you gotta hang out
with the mom.

52:13.517 --> 52:14.985
Why don't you go sit at the bar?

52:14.987 --> 52:17.856
Because I want to sit
at this table.

52:19.590 --> 52:21.758
Yeah, well, what are you
drinking?

52:21.760 --> 52:27.796
A Bud, and look... I'm sorry.

52:27.798 --> 52:29.965
For what?

52:29.967 --> 52:32.735
Because I never called you...

52:32.737 --> 52:35.839
and I've been hanging out with
your kid and you know...

52:35.841 --> 52:38.542
I know that maybe that's not
acceptable.

52:38.544 --> 52:41.279
What are you talking about?

52:41.281 --> 52:43.681
I know you're pissed,
because I never called you.

52:43.683 --> 52:46.420
Who told you that bullshit.

52:48.053 --> 52:50.288
That's not what's going on?

52:50.290 --> 52:55.329
Look, you're nice, but
you're depressing as fuck.

52:59.565 --> 53:00.699
Then why'd you yell at me?

53:00.701 --> 53:02.333
'Cause you're awful around kids.

53:02.335 --> 53:04.068
You told him he was
going to have a stroke?

53:04.070 --> 53:06.505
No, I told him he
could have a stroke.

53:06.507 --> 53:07.838
He got punched in the face.

53:07.840 --> 53:09.374
Well, kids get into fights, man.

53:09.376 --> 53:11.443
Not when they're with adults.

53:11.445 --> 53:13.679
You told him he could get into
as much trouble...

53:13.681 --> 53:15.713
as he wants until he's 18.

53:15.715 --> 53:17.581
He told you that?

53:17.583 --> 53:20.652
I'm his mother. He tells me
everything.

53:20.654 --> 53:22.555
I told him within reason.

53:22.557 --> 53:25.091
Was that before or after you
told him...

53:25.093 --> 53:26.725
that he would never play
pro baseball?

53:26.727 --> 53:29.796
That I was just being on the
level with him, I mean...

53:29.798 --> 53:32.999
He's 12, he doesn't need you
to be on the level with him.

53:33.001 --> 53:34.767
He's got his whole
life to be disappointed.

53:34.769 --> 53:36.002
Let him have this.

53:36.004 --> 53:37.803
All right, look, I'm sorry.

53:37.805 --> 53:39.839
He said he wanted to get his
name on the Wall of Fame...

53:39.841 --> 53:42.011
and... and I want to help him
do that.

53:44.479 --> 53:47.483
You really think he could
get his name on the wall?

53:48.750 --> 53:50.818
Maybe if he, if he pitches
well...

53:50.820 --> 53:52.985
for the rest of the season
then... maybe.

53:52.987 --> 53:56.356
He really pitched well?

53:56.358 --> 53:58.425
He did.

53:58.427 --> 54:02.362
Okay, fine, but none of this
depressing shit.

54:02.364 --> 54:03.797
No problem.

54:03.799 --> 54:06.400
As long as you guys ain't
robbin' houses or nothing.

54:06.402 --> 54:08.068
Of course.

54:08.070 --> 54:10.007
I'll get you your beer.

54:15.445 --> 54:18.912
JOHN (V.O.): <i>Remember when
I told you that everything...</i>

54:18.914 --> 54:21.017
<i>in my life eventually went
to shit?</i>

54:27.124 --> 54:30.024
Back him up, and give me
a bottle of your finest.

54:30.026 --> 54:32.831
- Keep the change.
- All right, sure.

54:35.400 --> 54:36.831
John.

54:36.833 --> 54:39.567
Never seen you in here before.

54:39.569 --> 54:41.936
You trying to drum up
some votes?

54:41.938 --> 54:45.543
No, I came to see you.

54:49.679 --> 54:53.416
I want you to stop gambling
on the boys baseball games.

54:53.418 --> 54:56.085
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

54:56.087 --> 55:00.524
The other day, a man threw a
beer bottle...

55:00.526 --> 55:02.492
through one of our umpires'
windshields.

55:02.494 --> 55:03.926
Shouldn't have blown the call.

55:03.928 --> 55:05.365
John.

55:07.032 --> 55:09.865
Okay, look, things are a little
out of control...

55:09.867 --> 55:12.568
but it sure as shit
ain't my fault.

55:12.570 --> 55:15.638
Your problem is with these
animals here in town, not me.

55:15.640 --> 55:18.675
Don't make me out to be
the bad guy here.

55:18.677 --> 55:21.645
What are you going to do?
Call the cops.

55:21.647 --> 55:23.580
They don't give a shit
about gambling.

55:23.582 --> 55:26.984
Even if they did, half the
Dundalk PD bets through me, so...

55:26.986 --> 55:29.719
I'll cancel the season.

55:29.721 --> 55:33.526
Can't imagine that's gonna
help you get many votes.

55:40.466 --> 55:42.869
I know you're robbing houses.

55:46.507 --> 55:48.539
I have no idea what you're...

55:48.541 --> 55:50.742
I'm running for city office?
I talk to people.

55:50.744 --> 55:52.644
They voice their concerns.

55:52.646 --> 55:56.747
The other day, I'm going door to
door and somehow I ended...

55:56.749 --> 56:01.619
at Adam Kramer's, he tells me
that his TV got stolen...

56:01.621 --> 56:03.120
and it's the only thing
that they took.

56:03.122 --> 56:05.624
He thinks it's some kids
from the area...

56:05.626 --> 56:09.161
and I think that's a plausible
theory. Cops agree with it.

56:09.163 --> 56:12.632
Then I find out that the same
model TV taken...

56:12.634 --> 56:15.801
from Adam Kramer's
is at Debbie Houston's.

56:15.803 --> 56:19.571
And I know that she's working
two jobs just to pay the bills.

56:19.573 --> 56:22.912
So there's no way she's buying
a brand-new flat-screen TV.

56:24.245 --> 56:29.214
Everybody knows that Adam Kramer
is a degenerate gambler...

56:29.216 --> 56:33.854
and then I hear from some people
that he owed you a lot of money.

56:33.856 --> 56:37.090
I'm thinking that's a
heck of a coincidence.

56:37.092 --> 56:44.264
One TV, two links to you.
What do you think?

56:44.266 --> 56:45.668
I think you're thinking
too much.

56:48.070 --> 56:51.804
Am I? Maybe I'll run it
by Adam Kramer.

56:51.806 --> 56:54.708
Good luck running anything
by Adam Kramer.

56:54.710 --> 56:58.747
But then I'll try Chief Taggart
when I meet with him next week.

56:58.749 --> 57:02.252
See how many recent robbery
victims bet through you.

57:10.193 --> 57:12.162
MATT: Thank you much.

57:18.234 --> 57:23.873
Hey, what's it going to take?

57:23.875 --> 57:26.342
- What?
- What do you want?

57:26.344 --> 57:32.083
Campaign contribution. You want
a cut, cash, what do you want?

57:34.085 --> 57:36.121
I want you to do
the right thing.

57:40.692 --> 57:42.561
<i>(ENGINE STARTING)</i>

57:53.638 --> 57:55.108
(KNOCKING)

58:01.146 --> 58:02.879
What are you doing?

58:02.881 --> 58:05.649
Taking the TV, because you can't
keep your mouth shut.

58:05.651 --> 58:07.283
What do you mean? I didn't
tell anyone.

58:07.285 --> 58:08.886
Sure, you didn't.

58:08.888 --> 58:10.654
Just like you didn't tell
your mommy everything.

58:10.656 --> 58:13.157
I didn't tell her about
the TV or anyone else.

58:13.159 --> 58:14.891
- Oh, then how does everyone know?
- I don't know.

58:14.893 --> 58:16.927
- Well, I didn't tell anyone.
- Well, neither did I!

58:16.929 --> 58:18.630
Well then, how does your league
commissioner know...

58:18.632 --> 58:20.797
that the TV we stole was
in your house?

58:20.799 --> 58:22.135
I don't know.

58:26.639 --> 58:28.139
What are you gonna do with it?

58:28.141 --> 58:29.706
It doesn't matter.

58:29.708 --> 58:31.275
You need to learn that actions
have consequences.

58:31.277 --> 58:32.810
What the hell is that?

58:32.812 --> 58:34.847
It's a TV, Dad, what does
it look like?

58:34.849 --> 58:38.182
Well, is it hot? I can't
have a hot TV in here.

58:38.184 --> 58:40.251
You want the TV or not?

58:40.253 --> 58:42.687
- What's the catch?
- There's no catch.

58:42.689 --> 58:46.158
I got a guy after me,
had to watch my back.

58:46.160 --> 58:47.825
You got anything on him?

58:47.827 --> 58:50.428
No, there's not a damn thing
on him, he's clean.

58:50.430 --> 58:53.698
Every man's got something.

58:53.700 --> 58:55.867
Some guys, you just gotta
look harder.

58:55.869 --> 58:57.837
Okay. You got any cables?

58:57.839 --> 58:59.706
Yeah, I don't know,
try the back room.

58:59.708 --> 59:01.674
What the fuck do I know
about cables?

59:01.676 --> 59:05.712
Jesus, this is a big
son-of-a-bitch, look at that.

59:05.714 --> 59:08.083
And way thin.

59:11.886 --> 59:13.286
You kept all this shit?

59:13.288 --> 59:16.822
Yeah, what do you mean?
Of course I kept it.

59:16.824 --> 59:19.692
- Why?
- Why?

59:19.694 --> 59:22.863
Well, I don't know, I thought
maybe someday...

59:22.865 --> 59:26.966
you'd like to have it, you know,
give it to your kids.

59:26.968 --> 59:29.736
Yeah, well it doesn't exactly
bring up happy memories, Dad.

59:29.738 --> 59:32.642
- Hey, I did my best.
- JOHN: Yeah, well...

59:34.142 --> 59:36.246
(GASPS)

59:37.380 --> 59:41.247
Hey! You okay? Come on,
sit down, whoa, whoa.

59:41.249 --> 59:43.283
And how long have you
been smoking?

59:43.285 --> 59:45.786
I don't know, forever.

59:45.788 --> 59:47.922
Yup, well, this is how
it happens.

59:47.924 --> 59:49.391
I know, I know.

59:49.393 --> 59:52.393
I would advise you to stop,
but you already know that.

59:52.395 --> 59:54.830
How many times you want me
to say, I know.

59:54.832 --> 59:57.332
I was looking at your previous
doctor.

59:57.334 --> 01:00:00.268
I don't recognize a Dr. Mancini,
he work in the area?

01:00:00.270 --> 01:00:04.004
- Souza County.
- Souza County... hospital?

01:00:04.006 --> 01:00:06.143
Prison.

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:10.847
This should help with the
breathing.

01:00:10.849 --> 01:00:14.751
You're not far away from an
oxygen tank if you're wondering.

01:00:14.753 --> 01:00:16.888
Thank you.

01:00:20.758 --> 01:00:22.758
Doc?

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:25.862
What's this gonna cost me
ballpark.

01:00:25.864 --> 01:00:29.097
I doubt Medicare covers this,
so probably 200 bucks.

01:00:29.099 --> 01:00:31.467
- What, a month?
- Three weeks or so.

01:00:31.469 --> 01:00:33.437
Jesus Christ, what's the point
of having Medicare...

01:00:33.439 --> 01:00:34.904
if it doesn't cover this shit.

01:00:34.906 --> 01:00:38.841
How long I gotta keep refilling
it for?

01:00:38.843 --> 01:00:42.145
On this medicine, I give him
five years, if he's lucky.

01:00:42.147 --> 01:00:44.450
Thanks.

01:00:49.321 --> 01:00:50.824
Thank you.

01:00:52.223 --> 01:00:56.160
I mean, I thought he was dead.

01:00:56.162 --> 01:00:58.199
Oh, man.

01:01:00.934 --> 01:01:02.833
I'm a mess, man.

01:01:02.835 --> 01:01:05.235
It's like, just when I was
getting even, this happens.

01:01:05.237 --> 01:01:08.338
And I got Smitty breathing
down my neck.

01:01:08.340 --> 01:01:11.074
Maybe you should stop.

01:01:11.076 --> 01:01:12.811
Stop? Why?

01:01:12.813 --> 01:01:17.215
'Cause... it's kind of shitty
anyway.

01:01:17.217 --> 01:01:20.519
It's not my fault that people
in his town act like savages.

01:01:20.521 --> 01:01:22.087
Okay? I'm not the one out there
telling them...

01:01:22.089 --> 01:01:23.221
to set the place on fire.

01:01:23.223 --> 01:01:25.057
But you're handing them
the matches.

01:01:25.059 --> 01:01:28.227
Oh, bullshit, somebody just
fucking hates me.

01:01:28.229 --> 01:01:29.828
Nobody hates you.

01:01:29.830 --> 01:01:31.497
Circumstances have proven
otherwise.

01:01:31.499 --> 01:01:33.933
You both had it coming.

01:01:33.935 --> 01:01:36.202
Your dad has been smoking as far
back as I have memories...

01:01:36.204 --> 01:01:41.372
and I've got to say you haven't
exactly been on the level.

01:01:41.374 --> 01:01:42.473
I get no support from you?

01:01:42.475 --> 01:01:44.411
Well, this is your support.

01:01:44.413 --> 01:01:47.313
You live life like everyone's
in your way.

01:01:47.315 --> 01:01:50.217
Preventing you from getting to
some level of happiness...

01:01:50.219 --> 01:01:52.284
that I ain't even quite sure
is out there.

01:01:52.286 --> 01:01:55.521
No, people owe me money, okay?
I gotta take care of my dad.

01:01:55.523 --> 01:01:58.090
That money solves real problems
for me.

01:01:58.092 --> 01:02:01.862
You'll but you ticket in beds from guys who don't
have lots of money, then they shouldn't bet.

01:02:01.864 --> 01:02:04.163
Well maybe you shouldn't
be taken advantage of them.

01:02:04.165 --> 01:02:06.032
I just want people to show me
the same respect...

01:02:06.034 --> 01:02:07.500
that I show them.

01:02:07.502 --> 01:02:12.339
Oh, like the respect you showed
me by not showing up for work?

01:02:12.341 --> 01:02:14.274
You want me to keep going?

01:02:14.276 --> 01:02:17.044
You have more to say?

01:02:17.046 --> 01:02:21.015
Things are only unfair when they
don't go your way.

01:02:21.017 --> 01:02:22.617
Aw, fuck you, Scotty.

01:02:22.619 --> 01:02:24.285
I'm just trying to help, man.

01:02:24.287 --> 01:02:26.557
Well, I don't want your
fucking help.

01:02:39.002 --> 01:02:42.103
JOHN (V.O.): <i>As much
as I hate to admit it...</i>

01:02:42.105 --> 01:02:43.272
<i>maybe Scotty was right.</i>

01:02:43.274 --> 01:02:45.440
<i>(MUSIC PLAYING)</i>

01:02:45.442 --> 01:02:47.579
<i>Maybe I was feeling
sorry for myself.</i>

01:02:50.047 --> 01:02:52.480
<i>You know, if things are gonna
break my way...</i>

01:02:52.482 --> 01:02:55.317
<i>I needed to force the action.</i>

01:02:55.319 --> 01:02:57.320
<i>I mean, if you're gonna push my
back up against the wall...</i>

01:02:57.322 --> 01:03:02.057
<i>then it's fight or flight,
it's kill or be killed.</i>

01:03:02.059 --> 01:03:06.128
<i>It's bases loaded, bottom
of the ninth...</i>

01:03:06.130 --> 01:03:08.398
<i>and I'll be damned if I'm gonna
be blackmailed...</i>

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:10.099
<i>by some bitch-ass

01:18:09.471 --> 01:18:14.073
<i>which is all you can ever
ask for.</i>

01:18:14.075 --> 01:18:19.045
<i>So yeah, there you go,
that's my story.</i>

01:18:19.047 --> 01:18:23.983
<i>As for basketball lines,
playoffs look predictable...</i>

01:18:23.985 --> 01:18:27.586
<i>this year, might have to jump
the line on the favorites...</i>

01:18:27.588 --> 01:18:30.656
<i>a point or two, since it's
top-heavy.</i>

01:18:30.658 --> 01:18:33.894
<i>You know, local gamblers like
to play the favorites...</i>

01:18:33.896 --> 01:18:35.962
<i>so knowing that, I gotta
protect myself...</i>

01:18:35.964 --> 01:18:38.198
<i>from all the action heading
one way.</i>

01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:39.399
Johnnie, let me help you
with that.

01:18:39.401 --> 01:18:41.605
Get in the fucking house.

01:18:43.338 --> 01:18:45.473
Fuck.

01:18:45.475 --> 01:18:47.474
Come on, guys, what the fuck
is this?

01:18:47.476 --> 01:18:48.675
Trying to throw games on us.

01:18:48.677 --> 01:18:50.344
Mickey.

01:18:50.346 --> 01:18:52.446
Yeah, play dumb like you didn't
have that kid throw the game.

01:18:52.448 --> 01:18:55.015
How long have I known you guys?
Huh?

01:18:55.017 --> 01:18:56.417
Why would I throw a fucking
game?

01:18:56.419 --> 01:19:00.021
I can think of about
10,000 reasons.

01:19:00.023 --> 01:19:02.690
Stevie, how many bets
have I let you slide on.

01:19:02.692 --> 01:19:05.493
Sorry, Johnny, it doesn't look
so good.

01:19:05.495 --> 01:19:06.662
I got you a job, man.

01:19:06.664 --> 01:19:09.264
Johnny, you met my nephew,
right?

01:19:09.266 --> 01:19:13.968
Yeah... fuck, ow!

01:19:13.970 --> 01:19:19.942
Shit. Whoo! God...

01:19:19.944 --> 01:19:22.145
I'm telling you, okay, look,
the kid pitched bad...

01:19:22.147 --> 01:19:23.445
because he was mad at me,
all right?

01:19:23.447 --> 01:19:26.149
Fucking kids, right?

01:19:26.151 --> 01:19:29.555
Fuck! God!

01:19:30.721 --> 01:19:33.222
Where'd you say the cash was?

01:19:33.224 --> 01:19:35.094
JOHN: Oh, come on, you made
your point.

01:19:38.697 --> 01:19:41.396
Oh fuck.

01:19:41.398 --> 01:19:43.132
This makes us just about even.

01:19:43.134 --> 01:19:46.970
Even? Come on, Mick, they didn't
even fucking finish the game.

01:19:46.972 --> 01:19:48.571
I don't think you lost shit,
buddy.

01:19:48.573 --> 01:19:50.507
Johnny, you know, if we let you
pull one over on us...

01:19:50.509 --> 01:19:53.113
we gotta let everybody do it.

01:19:54.579 --> 01:19:58.182
Oh, come on, guys, that's all
the money I got.

01:19:58.184 --> 01:20:00.020
Here you go, dinner on us.

01:20:05.190 --> 01:20:06.992
Sorry, Johnny.

01:20:17.570 --> 01:20:20.073
Come on, man, just pee.

01:20:31.150 --> 01:20:34.353
Come on, man, pee.

01:20:34.355 --> 01:20:38.024
Daddy, is that Sparkle?

01:20:38.026 --> 01:20:40.760
- Why does that guy have our dog?
- Ssh-ssh.

01:20:40.762 --> 01:20:45.567
Um, guys, just wait right here,
please, okay?

01:20:50.705 --> 01:20:52.174
John?

01:20:53.641 --> 01:20:56.275
Hey Bill, what's up?

01:20:56.277 --> 01:20:58.548
Why do you have my dog, John?

01:21:01.282 --> 01:21:02.748
Is that your dog?

01:21:02.750 --> 01:21:06.052
Did you break into my house
and steal my fucking kids' dog?

01:21:06.054 --> 01:21:07.686
What? No, man.

01:21:07.688 --> 01:21:10.656
Then why do you have
my kids' dog?

01:21:10.658 --> 01:21:13.325
You broke into my house and took
my kids' dog...

01:21:13.327 --> 01:21:14.727
because I owed you 500 bucks?

01:21:14.729 --> 01:21:18.097
You owe me $600 bucks, man.

01:21:18.099 --> 01:21:22.136
Do you have any idea of the
crying that has been going on...

01:21:22.138 --> 01:21:27.340
in my house, for what,
to get even with me?

01:21:27.342 --> 01:21:31.145
Well, I just... I mean...

01:21:31.147 --> 01:21:35.415
- Daddy! Daddy, are you okay?
- Go back, girls, go back!

01:21:35.417 --> 01:21:38.151
- I'm okay.
- Shit, man.

01:21:38.153 --> 01:21:41.489
- Fuck, man.
- What'd you come at me for, man?

01:21:41.491 --> 01:21:45.760
I just wanted my fucking dog.

01:21:45.762 --> 01:21:49.363
Yeah, dude, take the dog, man.

01:21:49.365 --> 01:21:53.037
There... there.

01:21:55.538 --> 01:22:00.541
You know, I was gonna pay you...
but I got laid off from my job.

01:22:00.543 --> 01:22:03.411
Times have been tough.

01:22:03.413 --> 01:22:05.581
I didn't know that.

01:22:05.583 --> 01:22:07.583
You know, I saw you the other
day and you had on that...

01:22:07.585 --> 01:22:11.254
new watch and I was like...
okay.

01:22:11.256 --> 01:22:14.256
- This... this... this watch?
- Yeah.

01:22:14.258 --> 01:22:20.462
This $75 watch, here, man,
you can have it.

01:22:20.464 --> 01:22:22.297
I didn't know...

01:22:22.299 --> 01:22:30.172
Hey, yeah, this is what they
give you when they lay you off.

01:22:30.174 --> 01:22:33.243
As a way of saying thanks,
like...

01:22:33.245 --> 01:22:36.480
"Hey, you don't have a job
or a pension...

01:22:36.482 --> 01:22:39.583
"but here's a nice watch."

01:22:39.585 --> 01:22:41.252
I'm sorry, I didn't know that.

01:22:41.254 --> 01:22:43.689
Yeah, well...

01:22:46.726 --> 01:22:51.261
Hey, you don't have
to pay me back, man.

01:22:51.263 --> 01:22:52.632
We're all good.

01:22:54.433 --> 01:22:59.273
You look like shit.
Take care of yourself.

01:23:00.706 --> 01:23:05.312
Let's go, girls, come on,
Sparkle, come on.

01:23:08.549 --> 01:23:10.382
- WALLY: Here you go.
- Thanks.

01:23:10.384 --> 01:23:12.185
WALLY: Mm-hm...

01:23:14.321 --> 01:23:16.655
Hey man, are you sure you don't
want something for your face?

01:23:16.657 --> 01:23:18.326
WALLY: Right on.

01:23:22.697 --> 01:23:24.330
Ain't Debbie working?

01:23:24.332 --> 01:23:26.464
Nah, she was, but she
had to leave early.

01:23:26.466 --> 01:23:27.933
Oh.

01:23:27.935 --> 01:23:31.269
It was some emergency
with her kid.

01:23:31.271 --> 01:23:32.604
What happened?

01:23:32.606 --> 01:23:34.874
Apparently, he broke into
her ex-husband's house.

01:23:34.876 --> 01:23:36.509
- You know Hooper, right?
- Yeah.

01:23:36.511 --> 01:23:39.544
Yeah, well, kid was still in
there when his old man got home.

01:23:39.546 --> 01:23:44.353
Get this, Hooper sees him and
beats the shit out of him.

01:23:45.887 --> 01:23:47.888
He told the cops he thought he
was robbing the place...

01:23:47.890 --> 01:23:52.395
but if you ask me, Hooper did it
to teach him a lesson.

01:24:02.771 --> 01:24:04.638
- Is he okay?
- Get the fuck away from my house.

01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:06.840
- Wait, wait, I just wanna know...
- I said get the fuck outta here!

01:24:06.842 --> 01:24:08.542
- Just hang on a second.
- Leave.

01:24:08.544 --> 01:24:09.877
What? I want to know
if he's all right.

01:24:09.879 --> 01:24:10.944
This is your fault.

01:24:10.946 --> 01:24:12.145
- My fault?
- Yes.

01:24:12.147 --> 01:24:14.282
You know what? Maybe if you
spent more time at his games...

01:24:14.284 --> 01:24:15.649
than with the fucking
commissioner...

01:24:15.651 --> 01:24:17.385
we'd be talking about something
else.

01:24:17.387 --> 01:24:21.322
Fuck, god... fucking...

01:24:21.324 --> 01:24:24.391
He's not your kid, okay?
He is my kid!

01:24:24.393 --> 01:24:27.261
You think because you hung out
with him for a couple of weeks...

01:24:27.263 --> 01:24:29.396
and taught him how to pitch that
somehow he's your kid?

01:24:29.398 --> 01:24:32.368
He's not. You have no idea what
it's like being a parent...

01:24:32.370 --> 01:24:35.671
to have to put food on the table
and pay rent.

01:24:35.673 --> 01:24:37.472
Explain to him why his dad
is a piece of shit.

01:24:37.474 --> 01:24:38.806
You know what? It's not my fault
his Dad's...

01:24:38.808 --> 01:24:40.542
- a fucking piece of shit.
- You used him.

01:24:40.544 --> 01:24:43.279
How the fuck did I use him?
I told you about the gambling.

01:24:43.281 --> 01:24:45.948
Nobody gives a shit about
your gambling!

01:24:45.950 --> 01:24:47.583
How the fuck am I using him?

01:24:47.585 --> 01:24:50.953
Because you were there when it
was ballgames and pizza.

01:24:50.955 --> 01:24:53.321
Where were you when
he needed you...

01:24:53.323 --> 01:24:57.693
when he was so upset that he
broke into his dad's house?

01:24:57.695 --> 01:25:00.664
I have been there for that kid.

01:25:00.666 --> 01:25:04.566
My son doesn't need another man
in his life letting him down...

01:25:04.568 --> 01:25:10.973
and I knew from the second I saw
you sitting at my table...

01:25:10.975 --> 01:25:13.977
it was only a matter of time...

01:25:13.979 --> 01:25:15.712
before you would turn
your back on him.

01:25:15.714 --> 01:25:18.982
- Jesus, what happened to you?
- Nothing.

01:25:18.984 --> 01:25:21.854
Wh... what are you doing?

01:25:37.869 --> 01:25:42.005
Where's my shit? Where's my...
where's my bat, Dad?

01:25:42.007 --> 01:25:43.675
What do you want that for?

01:25:43.677 --> 01:25:46.444
Hey, hey, look, why don't you
take a deep breath...

01:25:46.446 --> 01:25:50.614
and just calm down for a second
before you do something stupid.

01:25:50.616 --> 01:25:55.586
Huh? Will you hold the fuck on!
Sit down for a second!

01:25:55.588 --> 01:25:57.922
I meant to do it!

01:25:57.924 --> 01:25:59.491
You meant to do what?

01:25:59.493 --> 01:26:01.893
I was drunk when I ran Bernie
Gallagher over...

01:26:01.895 --> 01:26:03.494
but I meant to do it...

01:26:03.496 --> 01:26:05.497
he was having an affair
with your mother.

01:26:05.499 --> 01:26:09.401
You're just telling me this shit
now.

01:26:09.403 --> 01:26:12.637
Bernie and I drank at the same
pub and the night I found out...

01:26:12.639 --> 01:26:14.740
I look at his fucking face
across the bar...

01:26:14.742 --> 01:26:16.409
and I start going for him.

01:26:16.411 --> 01:26:18.444
Bernie starts running away
and I'm chasing him.

01:26:18.446 --> 01:26:20.046
I think, "This is fucking
crazy."

01:26:20.048 --> 01:26:23.416
So I tell myself, go outside,
go outside, calm down.

01:26:23.418 --> 01:26:25.385
So I go outside and I'm sitting
in my car...

01:26:25.387 --> 01:26:26.785
but I'm getting more
and more upset.

01:26:26.787 --> 01:26:29.454
And then Bernie comes out
of the bar.

01:26:29.456 --> 01:26:31.458
And you ran him over
with your fucking car?

01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:37.033
Well, I didn't plan it! It
boiled me over, I lost my shit.

01:26:38.666 --> 01:26:42.802
- And Mom?
- She left.

01:26:42.804 --> 01:26:46.039
She... she kept her mouth shut
during the whole trial process.

01:26:46.041 --> 01:26:47.607
Thank God, God bless her...

01:26:47.609 --> 01:26:50.076
because it could have been
worse, I think.

01:26:50.078 --> 01:26:53.646
Maybe she felt bad for me,
I don't know.

01:26:53.648 --> 01:26:55.650
A little guilty maybe.

01:26:55.652 --> 01:27:01.492
Anyway, she couldn't stay here,
she left.

01:27:04.493 --> 01:27:05.692
You...

01:27:05.694 --> 01:27:11.433
Look, I spent 10 years in prison
for doing something stupid.

01:27:11.435 --> 01:27:14.201
Now look at me, will you?
Look at me.

01:27:14.203 --> 01:27:17.541
This is what getting even
looks like.

01:27:19.610 --> 01:27:21.146
Get the fuck out of my way.

01:27:24.181 --> 01:27:25.714
Come on.

01:27:25.716 --> 01:27:27.715

JOHN (V.O.): <i>Look, I know
what you're thinking.</i>

<i>I didn't think it was heading
this way either...</i>

01:27:34.991 --> 01:27:36.427

do if you're in my shoes?</i>

01:27:50.142 --> 01:27:52.478
<i>Would you let it slide?</i>

01:27:55.746 --> 01:27:58.017
<i>Maybe you're a better person
than I am.</i>

01:28:56.177 --> 01:28:59.912
Come here. Do we know each
other?

01:28:59.914 --> 01:29:03.148
- Why?
- Why?

01:29:03.150 --> 01:29:05.520
Because you keep eye-fucking
me from across the room.

01:29:09.591 --> 01:29:14.661

I'm John Zbikowsky.

01:29:14.663 --> 01:29:18.899
I played baseball.

01:29:18.901 --> 01:29:22.702
Oh shit, Zibs, yeah.

01:29:22.704 --> 01:29:25.906
Sorry, man, I didn't recognize
you, you look like shit.

01:29:25.908 --> 01:29:29.710
What happened? You all right?

01:29:29.712 --> 01:29:31.647
Fine, man.

01:29:33.115 --> 01:29:34.348
So what? You just came here...

01:29:34.350 --> 01:29:37.617
to catch up on old times
or something.

01:29:37.619 --> 01:29:39.121
No.

01:29:40.755 --> 01:29:44.225
What's up, then, what's
with the bat?

01:29:44.227 --> 01:29:46.796
You gotta ball game
or something?

01:29:53.603 --> 01:29:55.369
Why are you looking at me like
that, man? You got something...

01:29:55.371 --> 01:29:59.009
You got some business with me
or something?

01:30:03.847 --> 01:30:06.013
We got a problem? I mean...

01:30:06.015 --> 01:30:08.720
You know my ex-wife
or something?

01:30:13.824 --> 01:30:17.162
No, nope.

01:30:22.766 --> 01:30:23.932

Yeah, well...

01:30:36.215 --> 01:30:39.851
fucking take care of yourself,
dude, you look like shit.

01:30:44.756 --> 01:30:46.158

01:31:39.312 --> 01:31:41.480
What are you doing?

01:31:41.482 --> 01:31:44.383
I'm trying to be a
"leaves-a-note" guy.

01:31:44.385 --> 01:31:46.186
Hm.

01:31:46.188 --> 01:31:48.387
Last time I was here, I didn't
really do the right thing.

01:31:48.389 --> 01:31:51.990
Yeah, I know. I've read it after
Mr. Mooney threw it on ground.

01:31:51.992 --> 01:31:54.127
And you let me carry on like
this the whole time?

01:31:54.129 --> 01:31:56.730
Yeah, I guess so.

01:31:56.732 --> 01:31:58.734
I guess I just didn't care.

01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:06.710
What happened to you?

01:32:08.845 --> 01:32:10.878
I think I got what was coming
to me.

01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:13.717
Yeah, me, too.

01:32:16.952 --> 01:32:19.419
I think maybe I gave you some
bad advice...

01:32:19.421 --> 01:32:21.755
these past couple of weeks.

01:32:21.757 --> 01:32:25.860
You don't go breaking into
houses, no matter what.

01:32:25.862 --> 01:32:27.995
Okay.

01:32:27.997 --> 01:32:33.067
Here, give that to your
mom for the hospital bill.

01:32:33.069 --> 01:32:34.469
Okay.

01:32:34.471 --> 01:32:36.774
It's not a lot, but it's
all I got at the moment.

01:32:39.943 --> 01:32:42.143
Want to know the real reason
I quit playing baseball?

01:32:42.145 --> 01:32:43.978
You told me about your dad.

01:32:43.980 --> 01:32:46.447
No, that's not it.

01:32:46.449 --> 01:32:49.017
I wasn't good enough.

01:32:49.019 --> 01:32:52.787
I was getting knocked
around in single A.

01:32:52.789 --> 01:32:54.556
Yeah, I could have worked hard
and got better...

01:32:54.558 --> 01:32:56.792
but that shit with my dad
happened...

01:32:56.794 --> 01:32:59.796
and it's just easier to quit.

01:32:59.798 --> 01:33:04.000
So I came home and I took
over his book.

01:33:04.002 --> 01:33:06.202
My whole life, I've been taking
the easy route...

01:33:06.204 --> 01:33:11.207
and I think maybe I used you as
part of that easy route...

01:33:11.209 --> 01:33:13.509
and I apologize.

01:33:13.511 --> 01:33:16.945
- It's cool.
- No, it's not cool.

01:33:16.947 --> 01:33:20.551
I'm sorry, friends don't do
that to friends.

01:33:20.553 --> 01:33:23.921
I got to pitch, I got in a
fight, I bet on horses.

01:33:23.923 --> 01:33:27.356
This is the best fucking
summer of my life.

01:33:27.358 --> 01:33:29.495
Me, too.

01:33:31.463 --> 01:33:34.230
Never got your name on that
wall, though.

01:33:34.232 --> 01:33:36.566
It's alright.

01:33:36.568 --> 01:33:39.035
So what are you going to do now?

01:33:39.037 --> 01:33:44.308
I don't know, probably take
a job, I guess.

01:33:44.310 --> 01:33:47.011
You still gonna take bets?

01:33:47.013 --> 01:33:50.214
I say no now, but football
season's gonna roll around...

01:33:50.216 --> 01:33:53.353
- I probably got to reassess.
- Yeah.

01:33:54.888 --> 01:33:56.987
What are you gonna do
with the rest of the summer?

01:33:56.989 --> 01:33:58.255
Don't know.

01:33:58.257 --> 01:34:01.191
Might want to figure that out
before school starts back up.

01:34:01.193 --> 01:34:05.532
Next season, will you come
see me pitch?

01:34:07.334 --> 01:34:09.335
Shit, yeah.

Is that the guy you know
