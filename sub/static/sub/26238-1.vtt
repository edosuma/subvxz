16:00.860 --> 16:02.961
       I don't know. Late.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.131
      You got plans today?

16:07.233 --> 16:09.467
    I've got some work to do.

16:09.569 --> 16:12.503
    Maybe I'll go for a run,
       hang out with Kim.

16:12.605 --> 16:14.305
  Well, have fun, but remember

16:14.407 --> 16:16.841
    I have dinner with Robert
 tonight, so you're on your own.

16:16.943 --> 16:18.076
              What?

16:18.178 --> 16:20.078
       He's so weird, Mom.

16:20.180 --> 16:24.415
         He's not weird.
        He's just quirky.

16:24.517 --> 16:27.652
 Okay, those thick clear glasses
  look like a serial killer's,

16:27.754 --> 16:31.689
        and he's got like
 the worst weave I've ever seen.

16:31.791 --> 16:34.926
           [laughing]
         Listen, kiddo.

16:37.864 --> 16:39.764
   When you get to be my age,

16:39.866 --> 16:41.899
     your gonna see that not
    every guy has a six-pack

16:42.002 --> 16:43.501
    and a thick head of hair.

16:43.603 --> 16:45.370
    Okay, now, I've gotta go.

16:45.472 --> 16:48.039
Where are you going? You usually
     don't work all weekend.

16:48.141 --> 16:49.674
         Denise asked me
       to cover her shift.

16:49.776 --> 16:51.943
   She picked up a little bug
     in the children's wing.

16:52.045 --> 16:53.611
     You're always covering
          for someone.

16:53.713 --> 16:55.046
   Well, we can use the money,

16:55.148 --> 16:57.015
     especially with college
           next year.

16:57.117 --> 17:00.585
     I told you, I could get
  a part-time job like Kim has.

17:00.687 --> 17:04.255
  Your job is to study, so you
   can get into a good school.

17:04.357 --> 17:08.459
  Why can't you just find some
  rich doctor at the hospital?

17:08.560 --> 17:10.294
        I'm sure they're
       crawling with 'em.

17:10.396 --> 17:13.598
  [sighs] Because the best ones
          are married.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.199
     Who's talking marriage?

17:15.300 --> 17:18.469
         Who raised you?
          You're so...

17:18.570 --> 17:21.339
       Okay, so hot water,
   Tabasco sauce, and ginger.

17:21.441 --> 17:24.375
  It works every time, okay?
      Now I've got to go.

18:53.933 --> 18:57.268
  - My mom knew I was hungover.
        - Was she pissed?

18:57.370 --> 19:01.405
 No, but I'll probably get some
    fake, spontaneous lecture

19:01.508 --> 19:03.941
      about responsibility
          and maturity.

19:04.043 --> 19:05.843
    She just needs some time
         to work on it.

19:05.945 --> 19:08.212
      Maybe you deserve it.

19:08.314 --> 19:10.414
         How bad was I?

19:10.517 --> 19:12.250
              Bad.

19:12.352 --> 19:14.385
          Don't worry.
     Everyone was so wasted,

19:14.487 --> 19:16.587
  they probably don't remember.

19:16.689 --> 19:20.324
    I just don't understand.
     I never get like that.

19:20.426 --> 19:22.960
   At least you got home okay.

19:24.998 --> 19:26.063
             Right?

19:26.166 --> 19:28.766
         Yeah, I mean...

19:28.868 --> 19:30.701
        Yeah, I guess so.

19:30.803 --> 19:33.905
         I really don't
       remember anything.

19:34.007 --> 19:37.642
       You don't remember
     Chris taking you home?

19:37.744 --> 19:39.644
      What do you remember?

19:39.746 --> 19:42.547
 I remember the fight with Matt,

19:42.649 --> 19:44.382
     hanging out with Chris
          by the pool,

19:44.484 --> 19:47.718
           telling you
    I wanted to stay, then...

19:47.820 --> 19:51.122
     nothing until I woke up
          this morning.

19:51.224 --> 19:52.456
   I shouldn't have left you.

19:52.559 --> 19:54.559
       It wasn't your job
         to babysit me.

19:54.661 --> 19:57.395
    It was my choice to stay.

19:57.497 --> 20:00.064
  Matt won't talk to me though.

20:00.166 --> 20:01.432
         What'd he say?

20:01.534 --> 20:03.434
      Didn't say anything.

20:03.536 --> 20:06.270
     Won't answer my calls,
     won't return my texts.

20:06.372 --> 20:07.672
       He'll get over it.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.674
      You guys always have
       these little spats.

20:09.776 --> 20:11.909
              Yeah.

20:12.011 --> 20:14.712
      Yeah, I guess we do.

20:16.616 --> 20:18.416
               So?

20:18.518 --> 20:20.851
            So what?

20:20.954 --> 20:23.921
         Riley, come on,
     you're my best friend.

20:24.023 --> 20:25.756
            Did you?

20:25.858 --> 20:29.493
  A lady doesn't kiss and tell.

20:38.871 --> 20:40.838
          [horn blares]

20:53.052 --> 20:55.620
        How long were you
     planning to ignore me?

20:55.722 --> 20:57.188
  I have nothing to say to you.

20:57.290 --> 20:58.856
     I wanted to apologize,

20:58.958 --> 21:00.992
      if you weren't being
      such a jerk about it.

21:01.094 --> 21:02.960
      Oh, I'm being a jerk?

21:03.062 --> 21:04.695
First, you accuse me of flirting
        with Laura Lewis,

21:04.797 --> 21:06.497
  then you make a complete fool
    of yourself at the party,

21:06.599 --> 21:09.200
   then you go and cheat on me
   with that rich pretty boy.

21:09.302 --> 21:10.534
  Wait, wait, wait, slow down.

21:10.637 --> 21:12.069
      What the hell are you
         talking about?

21:12.171 --> 21:14.572
         Come on, Riley,
  don't pull this crap with me.

21:14.674 --> 21:17.041
     I swear. I have no idea
   what you're talking about.

21:18.711 --> 21:21.445
    Someone sent these to me
           last night.

21:30.590 --> 21:32.723
    I don't know what to say.

21:34.127 --> 21:35.726
     That's what I thought.

21:35.828 --> 21:36.994
              Matt!

21:38.831 --> 21:39.964
              What?

21:40.066 --> 21:41.732
            Nothing.

21:56.215 --> 21:57.682
         Hi, sweetheart.

21:57.784 --> 21:59.750
          Where's Bob?

21:59.852 --> 22:02.320
         Thanks to you,
       throughout dinner,

22:02.422 --> 22:04.989
    I couldn't stop thinking
        about the weave.

22:07.794 --> 22:11.696
     Anyway, we just decided
  to take a break for a while.

22:11.798 --> 22:13.464
      Not because of that.

22:13.566 --> 22:16.467
     No, but it didn't help.

22:16.569 --> 22:18.369
           I'm sorry.

22:18.471 --> 22:22.740
      Ah, men come and go.
           You'll see.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.475
       How was your night?

22:24.577 --> 22:25.876
              Fine.

22:25.978 --> 22:27.311
      Did you do anything?

22:27.413 --> 22:29.747
     Just eat and watch TV.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.615
            No Matt?

22:31.718 --> 22:34.552
       Don't pretend like
       you don't like him.

22:34.654 --> 22:36.420
         I do like him.

22:36.522 --> 22:38.622
         You're just...
      You're just so young.

22:38.725 --> 22:41.692
  Mom, I'm not getting married.
      I'm just having fun.

22:41.794 --> 22:43.561
That's what I'm concerned about.

22:47.500 --> 22:48.899
       Is anything wrong?

22:50.269 --> 22:52.670
     Just tired, that's all.

22:52.772 --> 22:55.740
    Okay. Well, on that note,
      I am going to turn in

22:55.842 --> 22:57.742
    because I have to get up
      really early for work

22:57.844 --> 22:59.009
        tomorrow morning.

22:59.112 --> 23:00.144
             Night.

23:00.246 --> 23:02.146
     Goodnight, sweetheart.

23:36.215 --> 23:37.748
          [sharp thud]

24:04.911 --> 24:07.645
        Mom, is that you?

25:12.211 --> 25:13.744
          [Riley sighs]

25:22.955 --> 25:25.289
        You have the most
         beautiful eyes.

25:25.391 --> 25:26.891
             - Do I?
             - Yeah.

25:26.993 --> 25:28.492
      They just draw me in.

25:28.594 --> 25:31.896
     You know, they say eyes
   are the window to the soul.

25:33.432 --> 25:35.633
        What in the hell
   do you think you're doing?

25:35.735 --> 25:36.901
             Okay...

25:37.003 --> 25:39.203
      Calm down, calm down.

25:39.305 --> 25:42.206
     We were just chatting.

25:42.308 --> 25:44.074
  Jealousy doesn't become you.

25:44.176 --> 25:46.710
      What did you do to me
         Saturday night?

25:46.812 --> 25:48.679
      What did I do to you?

25:48.781 --> 25:51.015
 I think it takes two to tango.

25:51.117 --> 25:53.384
    If I remember correctly,

25:53.486 --> 25:56.153
        it was mostly you
         doing it to me.

25:56.255 --> 25:57.488
          You're sick.

25:57.590 --> 25:59.823
          I don't know
      what the problem is.

25:59.926 --> 26:01.759
    We both had a great time.

26:01.861 --> 26:03.394
     Oh, I had a great time.

26:03.496 --> 26:05.195
         That's what you
       kept saying, yeah.

26:05.298 --> 26:08.165
  And what about the pictures?

26:08.267 --> 26:09.867
         What pictures?

26:09.969 --> 26:11.502
   Don't play stupid with me,
       you son of a bitch.

26:11.604 --> 26:13.437
 The pictures you sent to Matt!

26:13.539 --> 26:17.775
  Riley, I don't have any idea
   what you're talking about.

26:17.877 --> 26:21.011
   I didn't take any pictures.
   I didn't send any pictures.

26:21.113 --> 26:22.479
         You're a liar.

26:25.685 --> 26:27.952
   Could you lower your voice
       just a tad, please?

26:29.522 --> 26:31.121
       People are staring.

26:32.658 --> 26:35.626
     You don't want to make
    a spectacle of yourself.

26:43.603 --> 26:45.469
        RILEY: Of course
       he didn't admit it.

26:45.571 --> 26:48.405
       He just stood there
    grinning like a jackass.

26:48.507 --> 26:49.740
         <i> - KIM: No way.</i>
            - Mm-hmm.

26:49.842 --> 26:51.642
           <i> - Really?</i>
         - Yeah, right.

26:51.744 --> 26:53.277
   <i> So what are you gonna do?</i>

26:53.379 --> 26:58.148
     Uh, I don't know. I...

26:58.250 --> 27:00.651
     I think I'm just gonna
        ignore the creep.

27:00.753 --> 27:01.986
          <i> Yeah, but...</i>

27:02.088 --> 27:03.387
             [ding]

27:03.489 --> 27:05.990
   - Hold on just one second.
            <i> - Okay.</i>

27:12.198 --> 27:14.331
 Hey, Kim, let me call you back.

27:52.171 --> 27:53.437
           [knocking]

27:59.345 --> 28:00.444
              Hey.

28:02.214 --> 28:04.148
           [chuckles]

28:05.584 --> 28:07.284
 I remember you liked it rough.

28:07.386 --> 28:08.986
 Lucky I didn't break your jaw.

28:09.088 --> 28:11.789
 I love it when you talk dirty.

28:11.891 --> 28:14.658
   How's this for dirty talk?
 You're a pathetic piece of crap

28:14.760 --> 28:17.561
       who probably needs
    those photos to get off.

28:17.663 --> 28:19.730
           Oh, Riley,
     again with the photos.

28:19.832 --> 28:21.498
      I told you yesterday.

28:21.600 --> 28:23.500
      I don't have any idea
   what you're talking about.

28:23.602 --> 28:25.502
    You expect me to believe
  you didn't email me pictures,

28:25.604 --> 28:26.804
    didn't text them to Matt?

28:26.906 --> 28:28.172
          What photos?

28:28.274 --> 28:31.608
   The pictures of you and me.
            You know.

28:31.711 --> 28:36.580
Well, I can't say it wouldn't be
       an appealing thing

28:36.682 --> 28:40.951
    to have in my possession
  for all those lonely nights,

28:41.053 --> 28:44.154
    but no, I don't have 'em.

28:46.025 --> 28:47.925
    How 'bout we make a deal?

28:48.027 --> 28:50.861
   You delete them right now,
  and I don't go to the police.

28:50.963 --> 28:53.831
           The police?
           [chuckles]

28:53.933 --> 28:54.965
           With what?

28:55.067 --> 28:56.366
           The photos.

28:56.469 --> 28:58.135
      They're on my laptop.

28:58.237 --> 29:00.671
  You can deny it all you want,

29:00.773 --> 29:02.840
       but I'll show them
      you sent them to me.

29:02.942 --> 29:05.275
             I did?

29:06.879 --> 29:12.382
         Listen, Riley,
     can we just start over?

29:12.485 --> 29:14.952
This is getting way out of hand.

29:15.054 --> 29:17.020
        The way I see it,
          the two of us

29:17.123 --> 29:20.390
   just had a little too much
    to drink the other night.

29:20.493 --> 29:22.626
  You more than me, obviously.

29:22.728 --> 29:26.630
        So we hooked up.
            Big deal.

29:26.732 --> 29:29.199
       I had a great time.

29:29.301 --> 29:33.570
    Judging by your reaction,
    you had an amazing time.

29:33.672 --> 29:36.907
    Why should we deny that?

29:37.009 --> 29:38.408
         You're insane.

29:40.613 --> 29:43.380
            Come on,
      you know you want it.

29:43.482 --> 29:46.216
          Let go of me!
        I'm warning you.

29:46.318 --> 29:48.018
            Or what?

29:48.120 --> 29:50.654
      I'll tell everybody.

29:50.756 --> 29:54.057
            [laughs]
    No one will believe you.

29:54.160 --> 29:56.160
        And those who do

29:56.262 --> 29:59.163
          won't be able
    to do anything about it.

30:01.634 --> 30:03.667
       Now let me give you
       what you came for.

30:06.806 --> 30:10.507
     If you touch me again,
  I'll have a surprise for you.

30:10.609 --> 30:14.511
               Oh!
            [laughs]

30:14.613 --> 30:16.113
              Bye.

30:24.857 --> 30:28.325
    I'm gonna tell everyone.
            [laughs]

30:29.662 --> 30:32.863
    Oh, you beautiful thing.

30:44.176 --> 30:45.776
           [knocking]

30:47.079 --> 30:49.079
     Hey, what are you-- Oh!

30:49.181 --> 30:51.782
          What's wrong?

30:51.884 --> 30:54.651
      My parents are home.
       Let's talk outside.

31:01.694 --> 31:02.960
     Tell me what happened.

31:04.396 --> 31:08.665
           Last night,
     someone sent me photos.

31:08.767 --> 31:11.635
         Photos like...

31:11.737 --> 31:13.604
           God, Matt.

31:13.706 --> 31:16.306
       I'm so humiliated.

31:16.408 --> 31:17.908
           I'm sorry.

31:18.010 --> 31:19.676
     Don't worry about that
           right now.

31:19.778 --> 31:21.945
  Okay, tell me what happened.

31:22.047 --> 31:24.448
     I went to Chris' house
          to warn him.

31:24.550 --> 31:25.782
          To warn him?

31:25.885 --> 31:27.985
           To warn him
      that he better stop.

31:28.087 --> 31:30.053
           You're sure
       they were from him?

31:30.155 --> 31:33.423
   It's a phony email address,
          but who else?

31:35.127 --> 31:37.761
        When I got there,
        he was all alone,

31:37.863 --> 31:40.163
       and I told him that
      he better delete 'em,

31:40.266 --> 31:44.368
   and then he laughed at me,
         and then he...

31:44.470 --> 31:46.403
            Did he--

31:47.439 --> 31:49.706
        No, but he tried.

31:51.043 --> 31:52.776
    He still has the photos,

31:52.878 --> 31:56.113
       and he's gonna keep
          harassing me.

31:56.215 --> 31:57.214
          No, he isn't.

31:57.316 --> 31:59.616
     What are you gonna do?

31:59.718 --> 32:02.686
            Let's go.
     We're going for a ride.

32:09.495 --> 32:11.094
        [banging on door]

32:12.398 --> 32:13.997
          RILEY: Chris!

32:14.099 --> 32:15.699
       You just can't seem
  to get enough of me, can you?

32:15.801 --> 32:17.000
           Go to hell.

32:17.102 --> 32:19.469
    You and I are gonna have
         a little chat.

32:19.571 --> 32:22.372
  So the big bad football star
        bares his teeth.

32:22.474 --> 32:23.840
      You're not gonna send
   any more pictures to Riley.

32:23.943 --> 32:25.709
        You're not gonna
    look at her, talk to her,

32:25.811 --> 32:28.145
   you're not even gonna think
  about her, you understand me?

32:28.247 --> 32:30.580
From the sound of these pictures
    you keep babbling about,

32:30.683 --> 32:33.517
   sounds like your girlfriend
     can decide for herself

32:33.619 --> 32:36.253
      what she wants to do.

32:36.355 --> 32:39.056
            Or whom.
            [laughs]

32:39.158 --> 32:42.092
  Stay away from her or things
   will get very uncomfortable

32:42.194 --> 32:45.028
       for you at Kennedy.

32:45.130 --> 32:46.830
        Is that a threat?

32:46.932 --> 32:48.298
         It's a promise.

32:50.602 --> 32:52.769
    Just remember one thing,
           my friend,

32:52.871 --> 32:56.940
          the next time
 you're with your little whore,

32:57.042 --> 33:00.110
 just know she's thinking of me.

33:00.212 --> 33:02.012
        [Chris laughing]

33:02.114 --> 33:04.948
 RILEY: Stop! It's not worth it.

33:06.018 --> 33:07.284
      Yeah, listen to her.

33:10.789 --> 33:12.522
 Close the door on your way out.

33:12.624 --> 33:14.191
           Bye, Riley.

33:14.293 --> 33:15.292
          [door slams]

34:02.074 --> 34:04.074
            [laughs]

34:08.147 --> 34:11.681
           [laughing]

34:19.891 --> 34:21.925
            [laughs]

34:28.967 --> 34:30.667
   PRINCIPAL: Right this way.

34:30.768 --> 34:32.369
          Matt, this is
       Lieutenant Forney,

34:32.471 --> 34:34.036
      He'd like to ask you
         some questions.

34:34.139 --> 34:35.639
       I don't understand.

34:35.741 --> 34:38.341
  Mr. Hopkins, you're principal
         has assured me

34:38.444 --> 34:39.976
    you're a fine young man,

34:40.079 --> 34:41.645
      despite what you did
       to your classmate,

34:41.746 --> 34:44.047
  so she's asked me to save her
        the embarrassment

34:44.149 --> 34:47.016
   of hauling you down to the
  police station in handcuffs.

34:47.119 --> 34:48.552
        Am I in trouble?

34:50.089 --> 34:51.688
      That depends on you.

34:51.790 --> 34:54.157
      I suggest you go with
       Lieutenant Forney.

34:54.259 --> 34:55.559
     I'll call your parents.

34:55.661 --> 34:57.494
        We'll straighten
      this whole thing out.

34:57.596 --> 34:58.962
          Come on, son.

35:00.666 --> 35:01.965
    MATT: I don't understand.

35:02.067 --> 35:04.034
     RILEY: What's going on?

35:04.136 --> 35:05.635
    It's a police matter now.

35:05.737 --> 35:07.204
  But Matt didn't do anything.

35:07.306 --> 35:09.072
And he'll have every opportunity

35:09.174 --> 35:12.042
 to explain that to the police,
         I promise you.

35:12.144 --> 35:13.977
      So you're just gonna
     let him take Matt away?

35:14.079 --> 35:16.313
  It's out of my hands, Riley.

35:16.415 --> 35:20.150
  Let me offer you some advice.

35:20.252 --> 35:24.688
    This is not how you wanna
 finish your career at Kennedy.

35:24.790 --> 35:26.990
           Understand?

35:32.131 --> 35:33.230
             [sighs]

35:33.332 --> 35:36.266
        - [siren wailing]
         - [horn honks]

35:37.503 --> 35:38.535
              Mom.

35:38.637 --> 35:41.805
 Riley, honey, what's going on?

35:48.780 --> 35:51.414
        It's okay, honey.
         Let's go home.

36:08.867 --> 36:12.435
       Okay, I'm not gonna
      beat around the bush.

36:12.538 --> 36:15.138
  Now, the Andrews have agreed
      not to press charges,

36:15.240 --> 36:17.707
        provided you two
      stop the harassment.

36:17.809 --> 36:19.910
          - Harassment?
    - I'm not doing anything!

36:20.012 --> 36:24.080
  One at a time, one at a time,
 or we won't get anything done!

36:24.183 --> 36:26.316
       Matt says he never
    laid a hand on that boy.

36:26.418 --> 36:29.085
           It's true.
         I grabbed him,

36:29.188 --> 36:31.321
        but I definitely
     didn't do that to him.

36:31.423 --> 36:35.292
 Miss Cramer, this isn't a time
     to manufacture stories.

36:35.394 --> 36:37.894
       So tell me, is that
        how it happened?

36:37.996 --> 36:39.563
    You heard what Matt said.

36:39.665 --> 36:41.898
  He barely laid a hand on him.
     I saw the whole thing.

36:42.000 --> 36:45.001
  And how do you suppose he got
     those cuts and bruises?

36:45.103 --> 36:47.070
  What's all this about anyway?

36:47.172 --> 36:49.105
 According to young Mr. Andrews,

36:49.208 --> 36:52.842
   Miss Cramer here expressed
    romantic interest in him,

36:52.945 --> 36:54.678
    and apparently there was
     some sort of rendezvous

36:54.780 --> 36:55.812
        at a school party

36:55.914 --> 36:57.948
and following that school party,

36:58.050 --> 37:01.117
 Miss Cramer expressed continued
    interest in Mr. Andrews,

37:01.220 --> 37:03.153
      and when he rebuffed
          her advances,

37:03.255 --> 37:05.689
       she had her friend
          rough him up.

37:05.791 --> 37:07.490
      He's a freaking liar.

37:07.593 --> 37:09.826
    But the two of you did go
   to Mr. Andrews' house, no?

37:09.928 --> 37:12.062
To get him to stop harassing me.

37:16.034 --> 37:18.768
   I don't think we'll have to
   turn up the volume on this.

37:18.870 --> 37:25.508
   Now, I obtained this video
        from Mr. Andrews,

37:25.611 --> 37:29.012
  and you can see for yourself
     the trouble I'm having

37:29.114 --> 37:32.215
        reconciling this
 with your claim of harassment.

37:32.317 --> 37:34.384
         He drugged me.

37:34.486 --> 37:36.786
      He slipped something
          in my drink.

37:36.888 --> 37:38.888
    Did you see him do that?

37:38.991 --> 37:40.890
     Did you save the glass?

37:40.993 --> 37:43.526
      Did you see him do it
         to anyone else?

37:43.629 --> 37:47.430
  'Cause, Miss Cramer, this is
   a very serious accusation.

37:52.671 --> 37:55.572
   Look, I've been doing this
          a long time,

37:55.674 --> 37:57.474
       and if you all want
           my opinion,

37:57.576 --> 38:00.043
        this is a typical
       high school drama,

38:00.145 --> 38:04.214
  except someone, Mr. Andrews,
       got seriously hurt.

38:04.316 --> 38:07.717
        Now, I think it's
     a very fortunate thing

38:07.819 --> 38:09.753
 that Mr. Andrews and his family

38:09.855 --> 38:11.821
    are willing to walk away
         from all this.

38:11.923 --> 38:14.090
 Now, may I suggest that you all
 just steer clear of each other

38:14.192 --> 38:15.191
          from now on.

38:15.294 --> 38:16.860
    But I didn't do anything.

38:16.962 --> 38:19.496
   Lieutenant, if my son says
     he didn't do anything,

38:19.598 --> 38:20.764
     he didn't do anything.

38:20.866 --> 38:24.067
  Sir, Mr. Andrews is a partner

38:24.169 --> 38:26.503
         in an extremely
      prestigious law firm.

38:26.605 --> 38:29.372
 They have unlimited resources.

38:29.474 --> 38:31.041
    Oh, so because he's rich,

38:31.143 --> 38:32.742
      you're gonna give him
    the benefit of the doubt.

38:32.844 --> 38:35.278
   No, that is not it at all.

38:35.380 --> 38:38.214
   What I'm trying to tell you
    is that the system favors

38:38.317 --> 38:41.217
  a person who has the ability
    to draw these things out.

38:41.320 --> 38:42.952
   What about right and wrong?

38:44.890 --> 38:45.922
            [scoffs]

38:46.024 --> 38:47.857
 Trust me when I tell you this.

38:47.959 --> 38:51.895
         A moral victory
     can be very expensive.

38:51.997 --> 38:54.464
        How much is this
      really worth to you?

38:54.566 --> 38:57.133
       Now, you can decide
      that this is a battle

38:57.235 --> 38:58.768
 that you're prepared to fight.

38:58.870 --> 39:03.840
      But I gotta warn you,
  it could cost you everything.

39:09.881 --> 39:11.247
   RILEY: I can't believe it.

39:11.350 --> 39:12.749
    I honestly can't believe

39:12.851 --> 39:15.752
       even my own mother
       doesn't believe me.

39:15.854 --> 39:18.788
      I believe you, Riley,
 but don't treat me like a fool.

39:18.890 --> 39:20.824
        I saw that video.

39:20.926 --> 39:24.427
    I told you he drugged me.

39:27.666 --> 39:30.133
      You don't believe me.

39:30.235 --> 39:32.135
    I know you may find this
    hard to believe, sweetie,

39:32.237 --> 39:34.270
      but I was young once
 and did some stupid things too.

39:34.373 --> 39:35.939
     Maybe even had a little
       too much to drink,

39:36.041 --> 39:39.109
 It doesn't mean I was drugged.

39:39.211 --> 39:41.811
      And people wonder why
  more assaults go unreported.

39:41.913 --> 39:43.780
          How dare you!

39:43.882 --> 39:45.548
 I see these victims every day.

39:45.650 --> 39:47.050
  Usually I'm the first person
            they see

39:47.152 --> 39:48.551
  after they've been attacked.

39:48.653 --> 39:50.053
    I'm the one that reports
      these to the police.

39:50.155 --> 39:51.388
       Which is your job.

39:51.490 --> 39:54.624
 Riley, how do you think I felt

39:54.726 --> 39:56.793
         sitting there,
   watching you in that video

39:56.895 --> 39:58.995
   in front of the detectives,
    in front of the Hopkins.

39:59.097 --> 40:01.264
      Do you know what they
    must have thought of me,

40:01.366 --> 40:04.267
 especially as a single mother?

40:04.369 --> 40:07.670
    So you're more concerned
 with what the neighbors think,

40:07.773 --> 40:10.473
      with your reputation,
    more concerned with that

40:10.575 --> 40:12.242
         than the safety
      of your own daughter?

40:12.344 --> 40:14.644
  Don't be melodramatic, Riley.

40:14.746 --> 40:18.181
 Listen to me, honey, you've got
 your entire life ahead of you.

40:18.283 --> 40:21.251
  You can be anything you want,
     but with social media,

40:21.353 --> 40:23.119
    you can screw all that up
     in the blink of an eye.

40:23.221 --> 40:26.623
   Don't roll your eyes at me!
      I've seen it happen.

40:26.725 --> 40:28.625
     People apply for a job
        at the hospital,

40:28.727 --> 40:29.959
   we check their references,

40:30.061 --> 40:31.761
         we check their
     social media profiles.

40:31.863 --> 40:34.264
   Do you know how many people
         we've passed on

40:34.366 --> 40:36.132
  because of questionable posts
          and pictures?

40:36.234 --> 40:38.101
    I'm in high school, Mom.

40:38.203 --> 40:39.369
          Yes, exactly!

40:39.471 --> 40:41.204
        And these photos
       follow you forever!

40:41.306 --> 40:43.840
           Okay! Okay.
  Can you just give me a break?

40:43.942 --> 40:46.309
      You don't think I've
   been through enough today?

40:46.411 --> 40:48.278
        Well, somebody's
     gotta look out for you.

40:48.380 --> 40:51.314
    I can look after myself.

40:51.416 --> 40:55.585
       Oh, God, you know,
      sometimes I really...

40:55.687 --> 40:58.354
       I really understand
          why Dad left.

41:13.972 --> 41:15.638

41:18.276 --> 41:19.709
             [ring]

41:22.614 --> 41:23.980
             [ring]

41:42.767 --> 41:44.234
         That's my keys.

        <i> any assistance?</i>

43:15.393 --> 43:17.193
          - Never mind.
           -<i> Ma'am...</i>

43:22.767 --> 43:26.102
       RILEY: I told them
they didn't have to send anyone.

43:26.204 --> 43:27.770
   Whenever someone dials 911,

43:27.872 --> 43:31.774
      dispatch is required
      to send a squad car.

43:31.876 --> 43:33.977
         In over half of
  domestic violence incidents,

43:34.079 --> 43:36.312
 the victim gets second thoughts
     after dialing for help.

43:36.414 --> 43:40.550
       So are you certain
 there was someone in the house?

43:40.652 --> 43:44.020
        There was someone
         in this house.

43:44.122 --> 43:47.056
   Okay, well, the responders
       that came searched,

43:47.158 --> 43:49.125
     and they couldn't find
    any signs of a break-in.

43:49.227 --> 43:50.960
   In fact, they couldn't find
        anything at all.

43:51.062 --> 43:52.795
       If my daughter says
   there was someone in here,

43:52.897 --> 43:54.664
     then there was someone
       in here, Detective.

43:54.766 --> 43:56.366
  And you didn't hear anything?

43:58.603 --> 44:01.337
       I'm a deep sleeper.

44:01.439 --> 44:03.673
   - But what about the video?
         - The Facetime.

44:03.775 --> 44:06.309
          The Facetime.
     There's a record of it.

44:06.411 --> 44:10.046
 All it shows is that I received
    a call from some number,

44:10.148 --> 44:12.081
          a number that
       I can guarantee you

44:12.183 --> 44:14.550
      can't be traced back
        to Chris Andrews.

44:14.653 --> 44:16.419
      So that's proof, no?

44:16.521 --> 44:18.421
       An anonymous call's
         a lot different

44:18.523 --> 44:20.256
        than an intruder
        inside the house.

44:20.358 --> 44:21.858
  Well, so what do you suggest?

44:21.960 --> 44:24.494
        We just sit here
       in an unsafe home?

44:26.931 --> 44:28.665
   Okay, here's what we'll do.

44:28.767 --> 44:30.667
  I'll have one of my officers
   spend the rest of the night

44:30.769 --> 44:31.834
     in front of the house.

44:31.936 --> 44:33.403
 Tomorrow change all the locks.

44:33.505 --> 44:37.674
     After that, there's not
      much more we can do.

44:39.511 --> 44:40.943
           I'm sorry.

44:45.717 --> 44:47.350
 KIM: This is all totally crazy.

44:47.452 --> 44:49.118
 RILEY: What'd your parents say?

44:49.220 --> 44:50.720
   MATT: Oh, they were pissed.

44:50.822 --> 44:53.122
    Pissed at the detective,
   pissed at the other family.

44:53.224 --> 44:54.857
     My dad's not an idiot.

44:54.959 --> 44:56.559
     He knows we don't have
         a ton of money.

44:56.661 --> 44:57.794
         We can't afford
        expensive lawyers

44:57.896 --> 44:59.696
       to fight something
         we might lose.

44:59.798 --> 45:01.230
  Plus they're worried that if
 the colleges get wind of this,

45:01.332 --> 45:02.765
          I might lose
    some of my scholarships.

45:02.867 --> 45:05.935
         It's messed up
   that he can do this to us.

45:06.037 --> 45:07.937
    Your parents say anything
        to you about me?

45:08.039 --> 45:09.038
           Like what?

45:12.577 --> 45:14.944
 Something happened last night.

45:17.482 --> 45:21.484
  I was woken up in the middle
  of the night by a phone call.

45:21.586 --> 45:25.421
   Someone was Facetiming me,
  but I didn't know who it was.

45:25.523 --> 45:27.256
      I answered it anyway.

45:27.358 --> 45:29.292
        And? Who was it?

45:29.394 --> 45:32.628
         I couldn't see,

45:32.731 --> 45:34.997
 instead of pointing the camera
          at his face,

45:35.100 --> 45:37.500
      he decided to show me
         where he was at

45:37.602 --> 45:39.502
     and where he was going.

45:39.604 --> 45:40.670
          Where was he?

45:42.707 --> 45:44.240
       He was in my house.

45:44.342 --> 45:45.742
       Oh, my God, Riley!

45:45.844 --> 45:48.578
         I know, I know.
 I was about to call the police,

45:48.680 --> 45:50.747
    but I guess he heard me,

45:50.849 --> 45:52.281
  and he ran out of the house.

45:52.383 --> 45:53.750
          Are you okay?

45:53.852 --> 45:55.785
    I just don't understand.

45:55.887 --> 45:57.253
       He had gotten off.

45:57.355 --> 45:59.522
        After the video,
 it was me that got in trouble.

45:59.624 --> 46:00.957
     Why would he risk this?

46:01.059 --> 46:03.226
          Because he's
     a freaking psychopath.

46:04.796 --> 46:05.962
          The photos of
      you and Laura Lewis,

46:06.064 --> 46:07.930
    the ones I got mad about,

46:08.032 --> 46:10.700
        who do you think
posted those on the school wiki?

46:10.802 --> 46:12.835
  I didn't even think about it.

46:12.937 --> 46:15.304
         I was too busy
    trying to calm you down.

46:15.406 --> 46:16.973
 Riley, what are you getting at?

46:17.075 --> 46:18.775
       It had to be Chris,

46:18.877 --> 46:21.244
           and he knew
    it would lead to a fight.

46:22.814 --> 46:25.281
   That means he targeted you
       from the beginning.

46:25.383 --> 46:27.316
        But why? Why you?

46:27.418 --> 46:29.552
Like you said, after he got away
        with the attack,

46:29.654 --> 46:31.354
   why break into your house?

46:31.456 --> 46:33.489
            Exactly.

46:33.591 --> 46:36.692
 The problem is, we don't really
    know anything about him.

46:36.795 --> 46:38.194
  He just showed up at school.

46:38.296 --> 46:40.563
         I have an idea.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.966
 We need to know more about him.

46:44.068 --> 46:47.370
           He's crazy,
      but he's not stupid.

46:48.940 --> 46:51.007
       Matt can't pretend
     to be friends with him,

46:51.109 --> 46:53.176
      and if Riley suddenly
     has a change of heart,

46:53.278 --> 46:57.246
      well, he's not gonna
      believe that either.

46:57.348 --> 46:58.748
       So that leaves me.

46:58.850 --> 47:00.850
           I'm sorry,
       I don't understand.

47:00.952 --> 47:04.053
      I get close to Chris,
      pretend I'm into him.

47:04.155 --> 47:06.689
    I can convince him of it.
          I know I can.

47:06.791 --> 47:08.424
 Kim, you played a flying monkey

47:08.526 --> 47:09.892
     during our kindergarten
           production

47:09.994 --> 47:11.194
      of <i> The Wizard of Oz,</i>

47:11.296 --> 47:12.929
        and now suddenly
       you're an actress?

47:13.031 --> 47:14.463
   I sold that flying monkey.

47:16.334 --> 47:18.568
       Besides, Chris will
       never fall for it.

47:18.670 --> 47:20.203
  He knows we're best friends.

47:20.305 --> 47:22.438
       And in high school,
   people change best friends

47:22.540 --> 47:24.273
        like they change
        their underwear.

47:24.375 --> 47:26.108
    He is an arrogant S-O-B.

47:26.211 --> 47:29.045
  Meaning he's so narcissistic,

47:29.147 --> 47:31.280
  he might actually believe it.

47:33.351 --> 47:34.951
           Forget it.
       It's too dangerous.

47:35.053 --> 47:37.553
 If he's crazy enough to do that
         to his own face

47:37.655 --> 47:41.023
  and sick enough to try to do
       what he did to me,

47:41.125 --> 47:44.560
  I don't even want to imagine
      what he's capable of.

47:44.662 --> 47:47.263
  Riley, you're my best friend.

47:47.365 --> 47:50.633
         He's after you,
    and he's not gonna stop.

47:53.404 --> 47:56.105
           Look at me.

47:56.207 --> 47:58.374
         I'm doing this.

47:59.911 --> 48:02.245
         I told you it's
   none of your business, Kim.

48:02.347 --> 48:03.880
      You're not my mother.

48:03.982 --> 48:06.949
    No, but I'm your friend.
    At least I thought I was.

48:07.051 --> 48:08.451
        And you're acting
      like such a selfish--

48:08.553 --> 48:11.988
      A what? What? Say it.

48:12.090 --> 48:15.291
 Riley, I'm sick of your drama.
          I really am.

48:15.393 --> 48:16.726
 Why don't you go talk to Matt?

48:16.828 --> 48:18.594
        He's the only one
        who believes you.

48:18.696 --> 48:20.796
     You're a loser, Kimmy.

48:20.899 --> 48:22.398
       If you think you're
     so much better than me,

48:22.500 --> 48:24.066
    go find some new friends.

48:24.168 --> 48:27.236
     See if they put up with
    your self-righteous crap.

48:35.680 --> 48:38.147
             - Hey.
          - Hey to you.

48:41.185 --> 48:44.820
       It's just sometimes
       she can be such a--

48:44.923 --> 48:47.356
           Never mind.
        I'm just pissed.

48:49.193 --> 48:53.529
       She takes advantage
of your friendship, doesn't she?

48:53.631 --> 48:55.131
        You have no idea.

48:55.233 --> 48:57.533
      Expects you to always
        be there for her.

48:57.635 --> 49:00.603
       She's there for you
   only when it's convenient.

49:00.705 --> 49:04.774
 Otherwise, all she cares about
  is her boyfriend and herself.

49:04.876 --> 49:07.643
        I've let her walk
       all over me since--

49:07.745 --> 49:10.846
    I'm sorry. I'm not gonna
  bother you with my problems.

49:12.650 --> 49:14.550
    How are you getting home?

49:14.652 --> 49:16.319
         I usually walk.

49:16.421 --> 49:19.322
 I don't live too far from here.
       I don't have a car.

49:19.424 --> 49:22.224
          I have a car.

49:22.327 --> 49:23.492
            Oh, yeah?

49:23.594 --> 49:25.061
              Yeah.

49:26.264 --> 49:27.730
            Come on.

49:48.987 --> 49:51.253
    What'd you win this for?

49:51.356 --> 49:54.557
           Who knows?
      One thing or another.

50:01.432 --> 50:03.632
  How long have you lived here?

50:05.503 --> 50:07.737
      Almost my whole life.

50:10.441 --> 50:14.110
    Where'd you go to school
         before Kennedy?

50:14.212 --> 50:16.679
         Is this really
   what you wanna talk about?

50:20.084 --> 50:23.019
      You know, I normally
         don't do this,

50:23.121 --> 50:26.922
 just come to some guy's house.

50:27.025 --> 50:29.125
       We're just talking.

50:29.227 --> 50:31.594
   Besides, I get the feeling
     you're tired of people

50:31.696 --> 50:33.195
     telling you what to do.

50:38.069 --> 50:40.269
    I know this sounds crazy,

50:40.371 --> 50:44.106
 but in some ways, it seems like
   you know me better than...

50:45.977 --> 50:47.977
             than...

50:48.079 --> 50:49.245
           Never mind.

50:55.420 --> 50:56.919
      That's because I do.

50:57.021 --> 51:01.390
     We're a lot alike, Kim,
           you and I.

51:05.329 --> 51:06.796
            Tell me.

51:06.898 --> 51:09.565
         I need to know.

51:09.667 --> 51:11.867
        Did you really do
        what Riley says?

51:11.969 --> 51:15.104
     Force yourself on her?

51:25.216 --> 51:27.850
 Do I look like the kind of guy
       who would do that?

51:32.290 --> 51:35.858
       She's always trying
        to get attention.

51:35.960 --> 51:38.661
   Doesn't care who she hurts.

51:42.600 --> 51:45.634
        I think it's time
  someone taught her a lesson.

51:52.477 --> 51:55.111
         - [horn honks]
      - [car alarm blaring]

51:55.213 --> 51:56.579
            Damn it.

51:56.681 --> 51:58.080
           What is it?

51:58.182 --> 52:01.217
  [blaring, honking continues]

52:05.189 --> 52:06.122
           [clicking]

52:06.224 --> 52:09.258
  [blaring, honking continues]

52:09.360 --> 52:10.860
             [beep]

52:17.535 --> 52:18.868
             [click]

52:30.381 --> 52:32.047
               No.

52:32.150 --> 52:34.884
           No, no, no!

52:34.986 --> 52:37.386
            [panting]

52:41.559 --> 52:42.658
             [click]

52:58.176 --> 52:59.208
          [Chris yells]

53:00.444 --> 53:03.245
   What is it? What happened?

53:03.347 --> 53:05.814
       They keyed my car.

53:05.917 --> 53:10.019
    Who did? Riley and Matt?

53:10.121 --> 53:11.787
            Who else?

53:11.889 --> 53:13.789
   We have to call the police.
   Who do they think they are?

53:13.891 --> 53:16.025
  There's no proof it was them.

53:16.127 --> 53:17.793
  Well, maybe someone saw them,
      or they left a clue.

53:17.895 --> 53:20.095
         We have to try.

53:20.198 --> 53:23.399
        Especially after
    what they accused you of.

53:26.771 --> 53:30.272
          Don't worry.
      I'll take care of it.

53:31.576 --> 53:33.175
        What do you mean?

53:36.247 --> 53:40.049
   I mean sometimes there are
  better ways to handle things

53:40.151 --> 53:42.518
    than going to the police.

53:44.388 --> 53:46.922
    Well, you're a lot calmer
        than I would be.

53:48.859 --> 53:51.093
       I'd make them pay.

53:55.967 --> 53:57.466
           [rustling]

53:57.568 --> 54:00.135
        RILEY: You okay?
      KIM: Yeah. You guys?

54:00.238 --> 54:02.871
   We're fine. It was a cinch.

54:02.974 --> 54:05.474
      I might have a career
         as a locksmith.

54:05.576 --> 54:07.743
     - He was really pissed?
           - Royally.

54:07.845 --> 54:09.712
    But he didn't touch you,
        didn't hurt you?

54:09.814 --> 54:12.248
         No. I made sure
      he kept his distance.

54:12.350 --> 54:15.017
- You really think he bought it?
   - I'm absolutely convinced

54:15.119 --> 54:17.853
            he thinks
  I can't stand either of you.

54:17.955 --> 54:20.322
   He thought he was so smart,
     like he was uncovering

54:20.424 --> 54:22.391
   some deep-seated resentment
         I had for you.

54:22.493 --> 54:23.525
        Ooh, that's deep.

54:23.628 --> 54:24.727
          Maybe you do.

54:24.829 --> 54:26.128
           [chuckles]

54:30.134 --> 54:32.901
          The thing is,
      while I was with him,

54:33.004 --> 54:35.337
    it was completely obvious

54:35.439 --> 54:37.506
        how manipulative
        and crazy he was,

54:37.608 --> 54:40.309
      but I wasn't scared.

54:41.946 --> 54:43.679
 In fact, it was kind of weird.

54:43.781 --> 54:45.781
    It was almost reassuring
         to be with him.

54:45.883 --> 54:49.118
   How do you think sociopaths
  manage to get their victims?

54:49.220 --> 54:51.253
        They're charming.

54:51.355 --> 54:53.355
       On second thought,
     it makes my skin crawl.

54:53.457 --> 54:55.391
      So what do we do now?

54:55.493 --> 54:57.259
You got the pictures I sent you?

54:57.361 --> 54:59.428
   Yep. Nothing too revealing.

54:59.530 --> 55:01.463
    The info on his license,
        we already knew,

55:01.565 --> 55:05.100
  and the other stuff was just
    generic, personal things.

55:05.202 --> 55:08.103
        Damn. I'm sorry.
     I did the best I could.

55:08.205 --> 55:10.773
     No, no, you were great.
      There was one thing.

55:10.875 --> 55:13.075
          The yearbook.
It says "Daedalus" on the cover.

55:13.177 --> 55:14.610
      I did a quick search,
        and it looks like

55:14.712 --> 55:16.478
     it's from St. Joseph's.

55:16.580 --> 55:19.815
   It's a private school about
  20 miles from here, up north.

55:19.917 --> 55:21.917
      He went there before
       he came to Kennedy.

55:22.019 --> 55:24.386
    Unless he's in the habit
 of collecting random yearbooks,

55:24.488 --> 55:25.454
              yeah.

55:25.556 --> 55:27.089
   Look, there's a kid I know,

55:27.191 --> 55:28.490
 went to football camp with him
       a few summers ago.

55:28.592 --> 55:30.159
         Parker McKeon.
        He's a good guy.

55:30.261 --> 55:32.761
      He goes to St. Joe's.
     I say we meet with him,

55:32.863 --> 55:34.263
     find out what he knows
          about Chris.

55:34.365 --> 55:35.998
   - Think he'll meet with us?
          - Of course.

55:36.100 --> 55:37.333
     He's a friend of mine.
   We hung out a lot at camp.

55:37.435 --> 55:38.434
       And if we're right,

55:38.536 --> 55:39.568
    he probably thinks Chris

55:39.670 --> 55:40.836
   is as big a dick as we do.

55:44.008 --> 55:45.474
             Riley.

55:45.576 --> 55:47.810
         I'm sorry about
  what I said the other night.

55:47.912 --> 55:50.312
          It was awful.

55:51.749 --> 55:53.282
        Thank you, honey.

55:53.384 --> 55:55.818
         But let's just
     forget about it, okay?

55:55.920 --> 55:57.986
    Dad is the one who left.

55:59.190 --> 56:01.590
        Dad. What a joke.

56:01.692 --> 56:03.292
      I mean, he's the one
      who walked out on us,

56:03.394 --> 56:06.462
       and you're the one
        that's been here

56:06.564 --> 56:08.263
    and given me everything,

56:08.366 --> 56:10.499
  and this is how I treat you?

56:10.601 --> 56:13.202
      Don't worry about it.
  It comes with the territory.

56:13.304 --> 56:15.204
    As far as I'm concerned,
         it's his loss.

56:15.306 --> 56:18.173
           After all,
     look what he's missing.

56:18.275 --> 56:20.976
  I hope I never see him again.

56:21.078 --> 56:22.478
    Otherwise, we might have
        to have a regular

56:22.580 --> 56:24.613
    Kramer vs. Kramer, right?

56:24.715 --> 56:26.448
           [laughing]

56:26.550 --> 56:29.017
    That's the stupidest joke
 every single time you tell it.

56:29.120 --> 56:31.620
       I haven't even seen
        that dumb movie.

56:31.722 --> 56:34.957
 Well, either way, I think we've
 been a pretty good team so far,

56:35.059 --> 56:37.226
           don't you?

56:37.328 --> 56:38.827
              - No.
              - No?

56:38.929 --> 56:40.229
        We've been great.

56:40.331 --> 56:41.764
           Come here.

56:44.802 --> 56:46.635
          - I gotta go.
             - Bye.

56:49.640 --> 56:50.539
            KIM: Hey.
         MATT: Hey, Kim.

56:50.641 --> 56:52.074
  KIM: I just talked to Chris.

56:52.176 --> 56:53.909
      He's at the body shop
       picking up his car.

56:54.011 --> 56:55.911
    MATT: Good, so we're safe
          to meet here.

56:56.013 --> 56:58.147
 I was thinking about something.

56:58.249 --> 57:00.716
     The other night when he
 Facetimed you, how'd he get in?

57:00.818 --> 57:02.818
    Yeah, how did he get in?

57:03.854 --> 57:05.320
         He had my keys.

57:05.423 --> 57:07.656
           I lost them
     the night of the party.

57:07.758 --> 57:09.725
        It's also how he
    must have gotten me home,

57:09.827 --> 57:11.293
  then he took them with them.

57:11.395 --> 57:12.828
    You didn't say anything.

57:12.930 --> 57:14.730
         I wasn't sure.

57:14.832 --> 57:17.399
        I was so wasted,
I figured I left them somewhere.

57:17.501 --> 57:19.101
      Then after the video,
  the last thing I wanted to do

57:19.203 --> 57:20.936
   was claim he stole my keys.

57:21.038 --> 57:23.405
  Riley, you gotta get your mom
     to change those locks.

57:23.507 --> 57:24.506
          She's right.

57:24.608 --> 57:26.308
        Hey, there he is.

57:27.745 --> 57:29.178
       Thanks for coming.
        Good to see you.

57:29.280 --> 57:30.913
            You too.

57:31.015 --> 57:33.749
    Parker McKeon, I want you
  to meet my girlfriend Riley,

57:33.851 --> 57:35.417
           and this is
      her best friend Kim.

57:35.519 --> 57:37.152
       Thanks for coming.

57:37.254 --> 57:39.321
   So listen, you know we want
 to ask you about Chris Andrews.

57:39.423 --> 57:41.757
   I know, and like we talked
       on the phone, dude,

57:41.859 --> 57:45.928
 I'll tell you everything I can,
but I didn't know him real well.

57:46.030 --> 57:47.796
            This him?

57:47.898 --> 57:49.598
        Yeah, that's him.

57:49.700 --> 57:51.533
  A lot of the girls liked him.

57:51.635 --> 57:55.037
   I guess he's good-looking,
    like really good-looking,

57:55.139 --> 57:57.339
         if you're into
       that kind of thing.

57:57.441 --> 57:58.874
        But I don't know.

57:58.976 --> 58:02.478
   He always seemed kind of...
         if you ask me.

58:02.580 --> 58:03.812
    And then what happened...

58:03.914 --> 58:05.614
        What did happen?

58:05.716 --> 58:07.316
       It was between him
   and this girl, Lisa Nelson.

58:07.418 --> 58:10.352
      She was nice, pretty.

58:10.454 --> 58:12.855
    But what happened, look,
    I heard a million things.

58:12.957 --> 58:15.224
     Who knows what's true?
     That's private school.

58:15.326 --> 58:16.658
         Everybody knows
      everybody's business,

58:16.760 --> 58:18.961
           or at least
       they think they do.

58:19.063 --> 58:20.629
       What did you hear?

58:20.731 --> 58:22.731
    According to some people,

58:22.833 --> 58:26.401
        he... forced her.

58:26.504 --> 58:28.470
   According to other people,

58:28.572 --> 58:30.005
  she was the kind of girl that
  didn't need much convincing,

58:30.107 --> 58:31.473
    if you know what I mean.

58:31.575 --> 58:33.542
      Did Lisa tell anyone?

58:33.644 --> 58:35.911
    PARKER: Yeah, the police
          investigated.

58:37.781 --> 58:39.982
     Chris got off, I think,

58:40.084 --> 58:42.150
     but he never came back
           to school.

58:42.253 --> 58:43.886
        What about Lisa?

58:45.556 --> 58:46.555
             [sighs]

59:13.717 --> 59:15.450
      [woman clears throat]

59:16.620 --> 59:17.886
           Ms. Nelson?

59:17.988 --> 59:18.954
              Yeah.

59:19.056 --> 59:21.456
  Hi. My name is Riley Cramer.

59:21.559 --> 59:24.593
I was hoping to speak with Lisa.

59:24.695 --> 59:26.595
   My daughter died last year.

59:28.866 --> 59:31.867
         I... I'm sorry.
         I had no idea.

59:31.969 --> 59:35.771
  Yeah, well, I'm gonna go back
to sleep now, if you don't mind.

59:35.873 --> 59:38.473
      Sorry for your loss.

59:38.576 --> 59:40.776
           Hey, uh...

59:40.878 --> 59:43.478
        since you already
   woke me up and everything,

59:43.581 --> 59:45.614
      why don't you tell me
         what you want?

59:45.716 --> 59:48.083
     It was nothing, really.

59:48.185 --> 59:51.954
  I had wanted to ask her about
   a former classmate of hers,

59:52.056 --> 59:53.922
   a boy named Chris Andrews.

59:54.024 --> 59:57.659
      A very dangerous boy.

01:00:00.998 --> 01:00:02.998
   Yeah, I don't usually sleep
          all day long,

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:05.133
but I had two shifts last night,

01:00:05.235 --> 01:00:06.935
       and I didn't get in
        until 7:00, so...

01:00:07.037 --> 01:00:10.639
        No, no, um, I...

01:00:10.741 --> 01:00:12.808
      I'm just really sorry
        I disturbed you.

01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:14.409
         It's all right.

01:00:14.511 --> 01:00:16.945
       You said you wanted
  to talk about Chris Andrews.

01:00:17.047 --> 01:00:20.415
  If you don't mind me asking,
      how do you know him?

01:00:20.517 --> 01:00:23.018
          Chris Andrews
       killed my daughter.

01:00:24.588 --> 01:00:25.754
           Killed her?

01:00:27.358 --> 01:00:28.790
         Not officially.

01:00:28.892 --> 01:00:34.463
   I mean, he wasn't punished
        in any way or...

01:00:34.565 --> 01:00:37.466
   people like him rarely are.

01:00:37.568 --> 01:00:40.168
 But yes, he killed my daughter.

01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:43.438
    Was he a friend of hers?

01:00:43.540 --> 01:00:47.976
     No. He was a classmate
        at St. Joseph's.

01:00:48.078 --> 01:00:49.978
   We wouldn't have been able
      to afford that place,

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:52.547
   but Lisa got a scholarship.

01:00:52.650 --> 01:00:56.051
 She was a field hockey player.
       She was incredible.

01:00:56.153 --> 01:00:58.520
     She was one of the best
          in the state.

01:00:58.622 --> 01:01:01.356
      She got a full ride.
    It was definitely better

01:01:01.458 --> 01:01:04.059
   than anything I could have
     done for her, you know.

01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:05.827
       She loved it there.

01:01:05.929 --> 01:01:08.130
      And then she met him.

01:01:08.232 --> 01:01:10.899
  He showed an interest in her?

01:01:11.001 --> 01:01:13.201
        Why wouldn't he?

01:01:13.303 --> 01:01:17.973
     I mean, she was pretty,
         she was sweet.

01:01:18.075 --> 01:01:21.476
   She was trying really hard
   to have friends, you know?

01:01:21.578 --> 01:01:24.513
  But she stayed away from boys
  'cause she and I were close,

01:01:24.615 --> 01:01:26.415
  and she used to say, "I don't
  want to end up like you, Mom.

01:01:26.517 --> 01:01:28.083
            You know,
    pregnant in high school."

01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:30.952
      So then one night...

01:01:31.055 --> 01:01:36.792
        there was a party
      after a game, and...

01:01:38.929 --> 01:01:40.328
          he raped her.

01:01:43.634 --> 01:01:45.300
           I'm sorry.

01:01:47.137 --> 01:01:50.005
    She went to the hospital,
   like you're supposed to do,

01:01:50.107 --> 01:01:53.542
       and they confirmed
   that there was intercourse,

01:01:53.644 --> 01:01:56.778
     but they couldn't prove
       that it was forced

01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:00.782
      because Lisa couldn't
       remember anything.

01:02:00.884 --> 01:02:05.087
   And then one of the nurses
           saw bruises

01:02:05.189 --> 01:02:07.522
    on her arms and her neck,

01:02:07.624 --> 01:02:11.927
    and they called the cops,
     and Chris was arrested.

01:02:12.029 --> 01:02:13.762
    And was he found guilty?

01:02:14.998 --> 01:02:16.898
   It didn't even go to trial.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.567
       I don't understand.

01:02:18.669 --> 01:02:22.637
   Their lawyer made an offer,

01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:24.840
      a substantial offer.

01:02:24.942 --> 01:02:29.411
    At first, we were, like,
     no, we wanted justice.

01:02:29.513 --> 01:02:31.446
      Lisa wanted justice.

01:02:31.548 --> 01:02:34.082
        He convinced you
         to make a deal.

01:02:34.184 --> 01:02:36.084
      And he explained that
    even if it went to trial

01:02:36.186 --> 01:02:40.055
   that there was no guarantee
 that Chris would be convicted.

01:02:40.157 --> 01:02:42.891
            It was...

01:02:42.993 --> 01:02:45.961
    just a he-said, she-said
           situation.

01:02:46.063 --> 01:02:47.829
     But wasn't there proof?

01:02:47.931 --> 01:02:49.731
             [sighs]

01:02:49.833 --> 01:02:51.833
     There was proof of sex,

01:02:51.935 --> 01:02:55.337
 but there wasn't proof of rape
 because she couldn't remember.

01:02:55.439 --> 01:02:58.006
        And the bruises,

01:02:58.108 --> 01:03:01.443
    he said that was because
     she liked it that way.

01:03:01.545 --> 01:03:04.246
       And in California,

01:03:04.348 --> 01:03:08.083
     if two minors have sex
          consensually,

01:03:08.185 --> 01:03:10.051
    it's technically illegal.

01:03:10.154 --> 01:03:13.321
     So she would have been
         just as guilty.

01:03:15.592 --> 01:03:18.493
So I made a deal with the devil,

01:03:18.595 --> 01:03:22.864
 and the understanding was that
 Chris would leave St. Joseph's.

01:03:22.966 --> 01:03:25.300
           And did he?

01:03:25.402 --> 01:03:29.304
  He left, but that's where the
nightmare really started for her

01:03:29.406 --> 01:03:31.807
       because his friends
    wouldn't leave her alone.

01:03:31.909 --> 01:03:36.945
  They just were tormenting her
  online and calling her "slut"

01:03:37.047 --> 01:03:39.548
       and saying she was
         extorting him,

01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:43.318
         and her friends
       were shunning her,

01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:47.155
  and she just was so depressed
          all the time,

01:03:47.257 --> 01:03:49.858
      and she wouldn't eat,
     and she wouldn't sleep,

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:53.161
      and then one morning,
            I went--

01:03:53.263 --> 01:03:56.631
    I'm sorry-- I went down,
     I couldn't wake her up.

01:04:02.206 --> 01:04:05.874
 And there was a bottle of pills
        next to the bed.

01:04:08.345 --> 01:04:09.978
       She killed herself.

01:04:12.015 --> 01:04:13.915
      She might have taken
          those pills,

01:04:14.017 --> 01:04:15.817
      but <i> he</i> murdered her.

01:04:15.919 --> 01:04:16.918

          Are you okay?
         You all right?

01:11:14.104 --> 01:11:16.437
       I'm gonna call 911.
    You're okay. Don't worry.

01:11:16.539 --> 01:11:17.839
             - Okay?
             - Okay.

01:11:17.941 --> 01:11:20.842
         [siren blaring]

01:11:25.715 --> 01:11:27.181
             Kimmy.

01:11:27.284 --> 01:11:29.851
       Oh, careful, Riley.
   She has a minor concussion.

01:11:29.953 --> 01:11:32.654
        Sorry. I'm sorry.
      How are you feeling?

01:11:32.756 --> 01:11:35.590
             [sighs]
       Got me pretty good.

01:11:35.692 --> 01:11:40.395
  Broken arm and a cracked rib,
        but I'll survive.

01:11:42.265 --> 01:11:44.332
        He took my purse
         with my phone.

01:11:44.434 --> 01:11:47.068
   RILEY: Did they catch him?

01:11:47.170 --> 01:11:49.003
     DETECTIVE: Ms. Cramer.

01:11:49.105 --> 01:11:50.738
        Any idea how this
      might have happened?

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:52.640
        Are you serious?

01:11:52.742 --> 01:11:56.644
  I know exactly who did this,
         and you do too.

01:11:56.746 --> 01:11:59.547
     Ms. Cramer, Mr. Markle
       wasn't able to see

01:11:59.649 --> 01:12:00.982
      the assailant's face.

01:12:01.084 --> 01:12:02.150
     He was wearing a mask.

01:12:02.252 --> 01:12:04.152
     Well, isn't it obvious?

01:12:04.254 --> 01:12:06.321
      If you're insinuating
   that this was Mr. Andrews,

01:12:06.423 --> 01:12:08.089
 there's just no proof of that,

01:12:08.191 --> 01:12:10.692
    unless you know something
   that you're not telling us.

01:12:10.794 --> 01:12:13.528
 I mean, it's just common sense.

01:12:13.630 --> 01:12:15.930
        You can't tell me
 you won't even go question him.

01:12:16.032 --> 01:12:18.900
           Ms. Cramer,
   despite what you may think,

01:12:19.002 --> 01:12:20.535
  we do know how to do our job.

01:12:20.637 --> 01:12:23.371
    And because of your past
  altercation with Mr. Andrews,

01:12:23.473 --> 01:12:24.839
we called his house immediately,

01:12:24.941 --> 01:12:27.275
     and his father told us
    that he was in his room,

01:12:27.377 --> 01:12:28.543
       studying all night.

01:12:28.645 --> 01:12:30.178
      And you believe him.

01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:32.714
    When respectable parents
     of Mr. Andrews' stature

01:12:32.816 --> 01:12:34.716
      tell us that his son
       was home all night,

01:12:34.818 --> 01:12:36.451
     until there's evidence
        to the contrary,

01:12:36.553 --> 01:12:38.052
         we're inclined
      to believe him, yeah.

01:12:38.154 --> 01:12:39.287
        Look at her arm.

01:12:39.389 --> 01:12:42.557
 What more evidence do you need?

01:12:42.659 --> 01:12:46.060
     That it was Mr. Andrews
   who committed this assault.

01:12:46.162 --> 01:12:47.862
     Well, who the hell else
          would it be?

01:12:47.964 --> 01:12:49.230
  We're going on the assumption

01:12:49.332 --> 01:12:50.898
           that it was
    a garden variety robbery,

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.033
       a snatch and grab.

01:12:52.135 --> 01:12:53.801
After all, her purse was stolen.

01:12:53.903 --> 01:12:57.605
  Riley, right now our focus is
  making sure Kim gets better.

01:12:57.707 --> 01:13:00.475
 It could have been a lot worse.

01:13:00.577 --> 01:13:02.610
  Let the police do their job.

01:13:02.712 --> 01:13:04.812
       When can she leave?

01:13:04.914 --> 01:13:07.215
        The doctors want
    to observe her overnight.

01:13:07.283 --> 01:13:09.917
       If there's no more
         complications,

01:13:10.019 --> 01:13:12.553
  she'll be released tomorrow.

01:13:12.655 --> 01:13:15.857
       Kimmy, I love you.

01:13:20.230 --> 01:13:23.398
   It's only a matter of time
  before he kills someone else.

01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:26.534
         And this time,
      it'll be your fault.

01:13:33.643 --> 01:13:35.009
        How she's doing?

01:13:35.111 --> 01:13:37.245
        Principal Atkins,
    what are you doing here?

01:13:37.347 --> 01:13:38.913
   I heard one of my students
          got attacked,

01:13:39.015 --> 01:13:40.548
        so I came to see
        how she's doing.

01:13:40.650 --> 01:13:43.284
     She's got a broken arm
     and a few broken ribs,

01:13:43.386 --> 01:13:45.219
        no thanks to you.

01:13:45.321 --> 01:13:47.054
    What do you mean by that?

01:13:47.157 --> 01:13:49.857
        Kim was attacked
   by someone wearing a mask.

01:13:49.959 --> 01:13:52.427
            - A mask?
  - Someone who happened to be

01:13:52.529 --> 01:13:54.429
          the same size
        as Chris Andrews,

01:13:54.531 --> 01:13:58.132
 who, by the way, just happened
 to threaten Kim this very day.

01:13:58.234 --> 01:14:01.035
         But, of course,
   the cops don't believe us.

01:14:01.137 --> 01:14:03.070
         I believe you.

01:14:03.173 --> 01:14:05.173
           Thank you.

01:14:07.277 --> 01:14:11.612
  What did you know about Chris
   before he came to Kennedy?

01:14:13.683 --> 01:14:16.384
           Oh, my God.

01:14:16.486 --> 01:14:18.252
            You knew.

01:14:18.354 --> 01:14:20.121
   You knew what he had done.

01:14:20.223 --> 01:14:22.123
  Riley, it's not that simple.

01:14:22.225 --> 01:14:23.925
          As principal
       of a public school,

01:14:24.027 --> 01:14:26.494
   I don't have the authority
    to decide which student--

01:14:26.596 --> 01:14:29.630
      You welcomed a rapist
         to our school.

01:14:29.732 --> 01:14:31.499
         Riley, please!

01:14:31.601 --> 01:14:34.135
   You go in, and you see her.

01:14:34.237 --> 01:14:37.038
    Take a good look at her,
     at what he did to her,

01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:40.308
      and then take a look
          at yourself.

01:15:25.488 --> 01:15:27.488
       [banging continues]

01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:29.457
        [Chris shouting]

01:16:07.130 --> 01:16:08.796
              Mom?

01:16:10.133 --> 01:16:11.732
     Do you want to tell me
         what happened?

01:16:28.551 --> 01:16:30.451
    You just stay right here,
            sweetie.

01:16:30.553 --> 01:16:32.987
   I'll be right back with you
       in a minute, okay?

01:16:34.891 --> 01:16:36.557
        Call the police.
        Tell them to send

01:16:36.659 --> 01:16:40.394
    the special victims' unit
  investigator here right now.

01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:46.367
         <i> [line ringing]</i>

01:16:46.469 --> 01:16:49.770
       Get over here now.
    I know why he's after me.

01:17:25.074 --> 01:17:27.274
       - Here, read this.
          - What is it?

01:17:27.377 --> 01:17:29.110
    When Lisa Nelson accused
     Chris Andrews of rape,

01:17:29.212 --> 01:17:30.745
      there was a hearing.

01:17:30.847 --> 01:17:33.447
  Both sides entered evidence,
      like an actual trial.

01:17:33.549 --> 01:17:35.349
   This is the sworn testimony

01:17:35.451 --> 01:17:37.518
         from the nurse
    who examined Lisa Nelson,

01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:39.620
      who saw her injuries
and reported them to the police.

01:17:39.722 --> 01:17:41.355
              Okay.

01:17:41.457 --> 01:17:44.191
        Look at the name.

01:17:44.293 --> 01:17:47.428
           Oh, my God.
     What are you gonna do?

01:17:47.530 --> 01:17:49.930
      First thing tomorrow,
      we go to the police.

01:17:50.033 --> 01:17:53.200
   Now we have what we needed:
            a motive.

01:17:54.937 --> 01:17:57.505
 You're amazing, you know that?

01:18:03.546 --> 01:18:05.046
      You want me to stay,

01:18:05.148 --> 01:18:06.847
            at least
    until your mom gets home.

01:18:06.949 --> 01:18:10.084
          I'll be fine,
  but tomorrow I want you there

01:18:10.186 --> 01:18:15.656
   when they drag that bastard
   out of class in handcuffs.

01:18:15.758 --> 01:18:17.825
   - I'll see you later, okay?
           - See you.

01:18:28.304 --> 01:18:30.204
         [engine starts]

01:18:33.876 --> 01:18:37.011
         [water lapping]

01:20:40.670 --> 01:20:42.102
            - [gasps]
             - Mom!

01:20:42.205 --> 01:20:43.704
           Oh, my God,
  why didn't you say anything?

01:20:43.806 --> 01:20:45.239
   I did. I called up to you.

01:20:45.341 --> 01:20:47.508
      - I was in the bath.
    - I thought you heard me.

01:20:47.610 --> 01:20:49.210
        Everything okay?

01:20:49.312 --> 01:20:52.246
       Let me get dressed,
  and I'll tell you everything.

01:20:52.348 --> 01:20:53.480
             Uh-oh.

01:21:02.225 --> 01:21:04.358
     I need a glass of wine.

01:21:05.361 --> 01:21:06.427
             [yelps]

01:21:15.872 --> 01:21:16.837
            [grunts]

01:21:17.874 --> 01:21:19.473
            Mom! Mom!

01:21:19.575 --> 01:21:21.442
Stay right where you are, Riley,

01:21:21.544 --> 01:21:24.778
 or I give Mommy a big new smile
        from ear to ear.

01:21:24.881 --> 01:21:28.048
       Let her go, Chris.
        It's me you want.

01:21:28.150 --> 01:21:30.150
           I'm the one
      who did this to you.

01:21:30.253 --> 01:21:32.620
        Admirable, Riley.

01:21:32.722 --> 01:21:35.956
          It really is,
   coming to Mommy's defense.

01:21:38.427 --> 01:21:41.095
   But we both know the truth.

01:21:41.197 --> 01:21:43.097
       It was your mother

01:21:43.199 --> 01:21:44.732
          who couldn't
     mind her own business,

01:21:44.834 --> 01:21:46.100
    who contacted the police

01:21:46.202 --> 01:21:48.669
        over nothing more
    than a misunderstanding,

01:21:48.771 --> 01:21:50.137
      who got me thrown out
           of the best

01:21:50.239 --> 01:21:51.972
   private school in the state

01:21:52.074 --> 01:21:55.109
  and forced me to go to school
      with trash like you!

01:21:55.211 --> 01:21:56.911
     Trash like Lisa Nelson!

01:21:57.013 --> 01:21:59.179
       But I stopped you.

01:21:59.282 --> 01:22:02.249
   I stopped you from getting
    exactly what you wanted.

01:22:02.351 --> 01:22:04.685
       - Riley, be quiet!
           - Shut up!

01:22:13.129 --> 01:22:15.596
           Stopped me?

01:22:15.698 --> 01:22:19.934
    Oh, Riley, I'm gonna get
     exactly what I wanted.

01:22:20.036 --> 01:22:21.769
      I'll have you again,

01:22:21.871 --> 01:22:25.205
         but this time,
     it won't end as nicely.

01:22:26.642 --> 01:22:28.709
      And if you're lucky,

01:22:28.811 --> 01:22:31.278
     I'll let Mommy watch...

01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:33.814
     before I kill her too!

01:22:33.916 --> 01:22:35.516
            [groans]

01:22:35.618 --> 01:22:36.617
           Riley, run!

01:22:39.055 --> 01:22:41.055
      Come back, you bitch!

01:22:43.926 --> 01:22:46.627
       Your bitch daughter
     may have gotten away...

01:22:48.464 --> 01:22:50.998
   but I'll make sure you pay
   the price for both of you!

01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:52.433
        You're pathetic!

01:22:53.569 --> 01:22:55.469
       Just remember this:

01:22:55.571 --> 01:22:57.738
       People like you...

01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:00.007
     will never get the best
       of people like me.

01:23:00.109 --> 01:23:01.375
               No!

01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:13.687
  I thought I told you to run!

01:23:13.789 --> 01:23:15.956
  Have I ever listened to you?

01:23:16.058 --> 01:23:17.391
            Oh, God.

01:23:21.130 --> 01:23:24.198
     Cops are on their way.

01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:25.899
        I'm still shaky.

01:23:29.672 --> 01:23:31.472
          He was evil.

01:23:34.677 --> 01:23:39.880
  But he won't be able to hurt
     anyone else ever again

01:23:39.982 --> 01:23:42.216
         because of you.

01:23:42.318 --> 01:23:44.184
         Because of us.

01:23:44.286 --> 01:23:45.919
        [distant sirens]

01:23:46.022 --> 01:23:47.254
