WEBVTT

00:51.790 --> 00:53.009
Well, I'm sure the police
will get to the bottom

00:53.009 --> 00:54.315
of everything.

00:56.056 --> 00:58.884
I don't wanna think
about it anymore.

00:58.884 --> 01:00.973
I'm sure you're right.

01:00.973 --> 01:02.714
Hmm.

01:02.714 --> 01:06.631
Besides, I can think of much
better things to think about.

01:06.631 --> 01:08.633
Oh, yeah?

01:08.633 --> 01:10.157
Like what?

01:10.157 --> 01:12.637
Like you and me finally
being able to go on a date.

01:13.986 --> 01:15.858
Not a coffee date,
not a study date,

01:15.858 --> 01:16.859
a real date.

01:19.470 --> 01:21.385
It does seem to be a much
better thing to think about.

01:32.309 --> 01:34.790
Charlie.

01:36.183 --> 01:37.967
You.

01:59.902 --> 02:01.817
Sorry for the wait.

02:01.817 --> 02:03.340
My apologies, ladies.

02:03.340 --> 02:04.602
I'm a bit under
the weather.

02:04.602 --> 02:06.735
That's okay.

02:06.735 --> 02:08.780
I have some bad news.

02:08.780 --> 02:11.479
Uh, your LAD scholarship
has been defunded.

02:11.479 --> 02:12.784
What?

02:12.784 --> 02:14.221
No, you can't do that.

02:14.221 --> 02:15.831
Mom.

02:15.831 --> 02:18.355
You've worked so
hard to be here and

02:18.355 --> 02:20.052
and at the start of your
sophomore year, you have

02:20.052 --> 02:22.751
to drop out because of
university budget cuts.

02:22.751 --> 02:24.666
No, no.

02:24.666 --> 02:26.885
You can't promise a student
something and then

02:26.885 --> 02:28.670
take it away.

02:28.670 --> 02:30.585
We're seeing massive
cuts across the board.

02:30.585 --> 02:32.195
It's not just Cassie.

02:32.195 --> 02:34.589
Cassie won that scholarship,
because she got

02:34.589 --> 02:36.808
straight As her entire
freshman year!

02:36.808 --> 02:38.593
She's a model student.

02:38.593 --> 02:41.596
With her accounts
in arrears.

02:41.596 --> 02:43.337
I've heard the library
might have some openings

02:43.337 --> 02:44.642
or perhaps worse stuff

02:44.642 --> 02:47.602
It's a $15,000 scholarship.

02:47.602 --> 02:49.430
You think Cassie can make
that up by reshelving

02:49.430 --> 02:51.345
library books?

02:51.345 --> 02:53.216
Perhaps, it's time
you and your daughter look

02:53.216 --> 02:55.523
into securing some
private loans.

02:55.523 --> 02:57.829
I have the information for
some lenders right here.

03:00.354 --> 03:02.094
I'm really sorry I wish
there was more I could do,

03:02.094 --> 03:04.488
the funding is
just not there.

03:09.885 --> 03:11.669
Thank you.

03:14.933 --> 03:17.327
I guess I'll just drop out

03:18.763 --> 03:19.938
and apply to community college
in the fall

03:19.938 --> 03:21.070
No.

03:21.070 --> 03:24.160
No, that is not happening.

03:24.160 --> 03:25.814
We agreed you were gonna
go to the best college

03:25.814 --> 03:27.294
you could possibly
get into,

03:27.294 --> 03:29.731
no matter what it would take.

03:29.731 --> 03:31.733
I'll

03:31.733 --> 03:33.778
I'll just take more shifts
at the nursing home,

03:33.778 --> 03:35.127
but you're not
dropping out.

03:35.127 --> 03:36.825
Mom, no.

03:36.825 --> 03:39.480
You already worked so hard,
you've done so much for me.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.743
Honey, listen.

03:41.743 --> 03:44.659
Before your father died
I promised him I would do

03:44.659 --> 03:46.661
whatever it took for you
to go to the school of

03:46.661 --> 03:48.315
your dreams.

03:48.315 --> 03:50.360
It meant so much to him

03:50.360 --> 03:52.710
and it means so much to me.

03:52.710 --> 03:55.365
So please, we'll figure
this out together.

03:56.671 --> 03:57.672
Okay.
-Okay.

04:00.109 --> 04:02.894
Just hold off on
taking extra shifts,

04:02.894 --> 04:04.418
okay?

04:04.418 --> 04:06.724
I found a scholarship
before, I can do it again.

04:08.160 --> 04:10.424
Attagirl.

04:10.424 --> 04:12.687
So what's the rest
of your day like?

04:12.687 --> 04:14.079
Hmm, I've got a couple hours
free and then

04:14.079 --> 04:15.690
a late study session
at the library.

04:15.690 --> 04:17.387
Oh.

04:17.387 --> 04:19.041
You know, how I hate the idea
of you walkin' around campus

04:19.041 --> 04:20.129
late at night alone.

04:21.652 --> 04:23.741
See if someone could
give you a ride home?

04:23.741 --> 04:26.135
I'm always careful, mom.

04:26.135 --> 04:28.050
I know, but remember
what I always told you

04:28.050 --> 04:29.443
when you were a little girl?

04:29.443 --> 04:31.401
That it's my job
to keep you safe.

04:31.401 --> 04:32.750
And my job to help you
keep me safe.

04:32.750 --> 04:34.012
Right.

04:34.012 --> 04:34.926
You must be getting late.

04:34.926 --> 04:36.058
I have to go.

04:36.058 --> 04:37.015
I'll see you Saturday
for brunch.

04:37.015 --> 04:38.103
Just like always.

04:38.103 --> 04:39.888
-Love you.
-Love you.

04:43.805 --> 04:44.849
-Good luck.
-Oh.

04:44.849 --> 04:45.937
-There you go.
-Thanks.

04:45.937 --> 04:46.982
-Hi, good luck.
-Thank you.

04:46.982 --> 04:47.852
There you go.

04:47.852 --> 04:49.506
See?

04:49.506 --> 04:50.899
Thank you.
- Thank you.

04:52.857 --> 04:55.382
Lambda provides
tuition assistance and

04:55.382 --> 04:57.993
free housing for those
with financial need.

04:59.342 --> 05:02.519
Though, I can see you don't
need that.

05:02.519 --> 05:04.869
But we're also one of
the most socially active

05:04.869 --> 05:06.480
organizations on campus.

05:06.480 --> 05:09.221
I won't say we party every
weekend

05:09.221 --> 05:11.789
But we know how
to have a good time.

05:11.789 --> 05:14.270
Of course, the most important
thing is sisterhood

05:14.270 --> 05:15.880
and a great alumni network.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.012
Good luck.

05:17.012 --> 05:18.753
-You seem like Lambda material.
-Mmhmm.

05:18.753 --> 05:19.841
There you go.

05:19.841 --> 05:21.146
Bye.

05:21.146 --> 05:22.583
Oh no.

05:22.583 --> 05:23.932
Uh, hi.

05:23.932 --> 05:26.238
Can I get an application?

05:26.238 --> 05:28.502
Oh, we just ran out.

05:28.502 --> 05:30.199
Okay.

05:30.199 --> 05:32.114
Well, I will
download one online.

05:32.114 --> 05:33.202
What's the website?

05:34.638 --> 05:36.988
I'm sorry but just no.

05:40.992 --> 05:42.820
Okay.

05:44.735 --> 05:45.867
Cassie.

05:45.867 --> 05:46.824
Hey!

05:46.824 --> 05:48.130
Lisa!

05:48.130 --> 05:49.784
Uh, Intro to Psych
last year, right?

05:49.784 --> 05:51.829
Yeah, you lent me your notes
when I had the flu.

05:51.829 --> 05:54.571
Thank you, you totally saved
my life.

05:54.571 --> 05:57.226
Or at least my GPA, which
is almost like the same thing.

05:59.054 --> 06:01.012
I saw you at the Lambda table,
are you applying?

06:01.012 --> 06:02.666
Uh, apparently not.

06:02.666 --> 06:04.712
Uh, they wouldn't even
give me an application.

06:04.712 --> 06:06.888
That's the Lambda way.

06:06.888 --> 06:09.412
They reject you before you
can get an application.

06:09.412 --> 06:10.761
It proves you're serious.

06:10.761 --> 06:12.284
That other girl got one.

06:12.284 --> 06:15.157
The other girl is different.

06:15.157 --> 06:17.464
Girls like us you know,

06:17.464 --> 06:19.466
scholarship girls,

06:19.466 --> 06:20.945
we just have to try
a little harder.

06:20.945 --> 06:22.294
Hmm.

06:22.294 --> 06:23.992
Go back, you'll see,
it's totally worth it.

06:23.992 --> 06:26.255
Oh.

06:26.255 --> 06:27.952
Is that stuff about the
tuition assistance

06:27.952 --> 06:29.737
and housing true?

06:29.737 --> 06:30.999
Yeah.

06:30.999 --> 06:33.044
Seriously, what do you
have to lose?

06:34.829 --> 06:35.786
Okay.

06:42.489 --> 06:44.491
It's okay.

06:44.491 --> 06:45.753
Hi.

06:45.753 --> 06:47.885
I'd really like
an application.

06:47.885 --> 06:49.539
Oh, look,
you just got more in.

06:53.325 --> 06:55.066
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

06:57.852 --> 06:58.853
It worked.

06:58.853 --> 07:00.463
Of course, it did.

07:00.463 --> 07:01.769
Let's see.

07:01.769 --> 07:03.553
Wait, what's a social
résumé?

07:03.553 --> 07:05.250
Don't worry.

07:05.250 --> 07:06.556
I know exactly what
they're looking for.

07:06.556 --> 07:08.210
Okay.

07:14.999 --> 07:16.479
So I spoke to my boss
and she's gonna give me

07:16.479 --> 07:17.785
Saturdays.

07:17.785 --> 07:20.178
I told you
not to do that.

07:20.178 --> 07:22.964
And I told you
we're in this together.

07:22.964 --> 07:25.009
There's my stubborn streak
right there.

07:26.750 --> 07:28.491
Hey ladies, can I get you
anything else?

07:28.491 --> 07:29.623
I think we're good.

07:29.623 --> 07:30.711
-You want anything else?
-I'm good.

07:30.711 --> 07:31.886
-No, I'm good.
-You're good?

07:31.886 --> 07:33.888
-Okay, whenever you're ready.
-Thank you.

07:35.280 --> 07:37.326
Anyway, I'm praying
I get into Lambda.

07:39.023 --> 07:40.895
Lisa said I'd probably
find out today and they've

07:40.895 --> 07:43.724
got financial aid,
tuition assistance

07:43.724 --> 07:45.377
Spoiled sorority girls.

07:45.377 --> 07:47.249
Yes, but not only.

07:47.249 --> 07:49.686
Lisa's nice and she's a
scholarship girl just like me.

07:49.686 --> 07:50.731
You know, there's
always an exception

07:50.731 --> 07:51.732
to prove every rule,
right?

07:51.732 --> 07:54.386
Hmm, yeah,
but I don't care.

07:54.386 --> 07:55.910
I can put up with a few silly
mean girls

07:55.910 --> 07:57.346
if it means that
I get to stay

07:57.346 --> 07:59.130
in school and you don't work
yourself to death.

08:01.393 --> 08:02.960
But aren't you supposed
to go through an

08:02.960 --> 08:05.963
initiation first where they make
you take

08:05.963 --> 08:07.878
cold showers, and recite
the Greek alphabet,

08:07.878 --> 08:09.706
and I don't know,

08:09.706 --> 08:11.621
hit you with a paddle
and stuff.

08:11.621 --> 08:12.579
That's called "pledging",
mom, and no,

08:12.579 --> 08:13.928
they don't do that anymore.

08:13.928 --> 08:15.320
Since when?

08:15.320 --> 08:16.452
Since the school banned it.

08:20.978 --> 08:22.066
Hello.

08:22.066 --> 08:24.547
Yes.

08:24.547 --> 08:26.288
Really?

08:26.288 --> 08:27.419
Uh, thank you.

08:27.419 --> 08:29.639
Yeah, yeah, I'll be there.

08:29.639 --> 08:31.075
What is it?

08:31.075 --> 08:32.250
I did it.

08:32.250 --> 08:35.210
I got into Lambda,

08:35.210 --> 08:37.212
and full tuition assistance,
and housing.

08:37.212 --> 08:38.822
You you get to
keep your Saturdays.

08:38.822 --> 08:40.128
Well, congratulations, honey.

08:40.128 --> 08:41.825
That's exciting.

09:01.192 --> 09:03.673
I didn't think a sorority house
could be this big.

09:11.463 --> 09:12.203
-Little help?
-Yes.

09:12.203 --> 09:15.250
Yes, yes, sorry, honey.

09:15.250 --> 09:16.817
I got distracted
by the house.

09:16.817 --> 09:18.775
It's so gigantic.

09:18.775 --> 09:20.255
Yeah, there are in Miami.

09:20.255 --> 09:21.473
You sure this is the
right place?

09:34.312 --> 09:36.010
Hello?

09:37.577 --> 09:38.882
Hello?

09:38.882 --> 09:40.449
Where is everybody?

09:40.449 --> 09:42.146
Studying maybe.

09:42.146 --> 09:43.626
I don't think a house full of
girls could be this quiet.

09:45.323 --> 09:47.064
-Check upstairs?
-Okay.

10:05.343 --> 10:07.128
Hi, so nice to meet you.

10:07.128 --> 10:08.346
-Hi.
-Hi.

10:08.346 --> 10:10.784
Come on, let's go see
your room.

10:10.784 --> 10:12.220
Yeah, come on.

10:22.970 --> 10:24.536
Wow!

10:24.536 --> 10:26.887
Guys, this is too much.

10:26.887 --> 10:28.497
No, this is Lambda.

10:28.497 --> 10:31.065
Too much means we're just
getting started.

10:31.065 --> 10:33.197
we have no time to waste.

10:33.197 --> 10:36.070
We have to get you moved
in before the house meeting.

10:36.070 --> 10:38.463
Turns out I'm gonna be
your roommate and Monica

10:38.463 --> 10:39.551
is gonna be your big.

10:39.551 --> 10:41.075
Um, uh, big?

10:41.075 --> 10:42.119
Big sister.

10:42.119 --> 10:43.468
It's like a mentor.

10:43.468 --> 10:46.036
Monica is the president
of Lambda.

10:46.036 --> 10:48.125
Having her as your big
is a huge honor.

10:48.125 --> 10:49.344
Seriously, I'm jealous.

10:49.344 --> 10:51.868
Oh, go on.

10:51.868 --> 10:53.261
I mean it, go on.

10:54.610 --> 10:56.264
Okay, well, thank you.

10:56.264 --> 10:58.266
This is all incredible.

10:59.659 --> 11:02.096
Oh, uh, girls,
this is my mom Debra.

11:02.096 --> 11:03.227
She's helping me move in.

11:03.227 --> 11:04.054
Nice to meet you
Miss Thompson.

11:04.054 --> 11:05.142
Oh.

11:05.142 --> 11:06.143
-Yeah.
-Okay.

11:06.143 --> 11:07.754
Your daughter's awesome.

11:07.754 --> 11:09.843
I think so.

11:09.843 --> 11:10.974
What do we have here?

11:10.974 --> 11:12.062
Cassie, right?

11:12.062 --> 11:13.542
I'm Wendy.

11:13.542 --> 11:14.761
-I'm your house mom.
-Oh.

11:14.761 --> 11:16.676
No, no, no, no,
no, you're family now.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.765
And I'm a hugger.

11:18.765 --> 11:20.375
Uh, this must
be your sister.

11:21.768 --> 11:22.986
I'm actually Cassie's mom.

11:22.986 --> 11:24.727
Wow, really?

11:24.727 --> 11:27.382
You look and sound
just like her.

11:27.382 --> 11:29.645
You must have been a baby
yourself when you had Cassie.

11:29.645 --> 11:30.820
Well, actually, I'm

11:30.820 --> 11:32.996
Unfortunately,
visiting hours are over.

11:34.345 --> 11:36.478
I was just helping
Cassie unpack.

11:36.478 --> 11:38.088
No exceptions.

11:38.088 --> 11:41.048
We have strict rules to
protect our girls and

11:41.048 --> 11:43.267
ensure a distraction-free
environment.

11:43.267 --> 11:44.747
I'm sure you can
appreciate that.

11:44.747 --> 11:45.792
Uh, it's okay.

11:45.792 --> 11:47.881
Uh, Lisa can help me.

11:47.881 --> 11:49.447
Uh, okay.

11:49.447 --> 11:51.232
Um, well, I guess
I'll be going.

11:51.232 --> 11:52.537
Don't worry about Cassie.

11:52.537 --> 11:54.278
Parents' day is at the end
of the semester,

11:54.278 --> 11:55.976
you're invited then.

11:55.976 --> 11:58.021
Meanwhile, Kappa Ada Lambda is
her family now, right, girls?'

11:58.021 --> 11:59.980
Right.

11:59.980 --> 12:02.025
Monica will show you out.

12:02.025 --> 12:04.680
Kerrie, may I see you in
my office now, please?

12:08.031 --> 12:09.816
Hey.

12:09.816 --> 12:10.991
Honey, do you need anything?

12:10.991 --> 12:12.340
No, I'm good.

12:12.340 --> 12:13.863
I love you.

12:13.863 --> 12:15.647
And I love you more.

12:17.475 --> 12:18.912
Right this way.

12:18.912 --> 12:21.697
We have so much
going on tonight.

12:27.094 --> 12:28.791
So the house is really
beautiful.

12:28.791 --> 12:29.879
Thank you.

12:29.879 --> 12:32.273
We love it.

12:32.273 --> 12:33.883
How long have you been
with the sorority?

12:33.883 --> 12:35.885
This is my fourth year.

12:35.885 --> 12:37.757
-Oh, nice!
-Yeah.

12:39.367 --> 12:41.021
Wow.

12:41.021 --> 12:43.240
The girls have a lot
of money here.

12:43.240 --> 12:45.460
Yeah, I guess.

12:45.460 --> 12:47.941
Listen, be honest with me.

12:47.941 --> 12:49.681
Do you think Cassie
will fit in here?

12:49.681 --> 12:51.422
Cassie is smart.

12:51.422 --> 12:53.990
What the other girls have
or don't have won't matter

12:53.990 --> 12:56.384
before long.

12:56.384 --> 12:58.603
Okay.

12:58.603 --> 13:00.040
Well, take care of
Cassie for me, will you?

13:00.040 --> 13:02.694
Of course.

13:02.694 --> 13:04.218
Bye!

13:04.218 --> 13:05.654
Bye.

13:14.706 --> 13:17.448
Good evening, Lambda.

13:19.711 --> 13:22.018
I'd like to take this
opportunity to welcome our

13:22.018 --> 13:25.108
new sisters Whitney,
Mariela,

13:25.108 --> 13:27.850
Breanna, Cassie,
and Susan

13:27.850 --> 13:29.852
to Kappa Ada Lambda.

13:35.031 --> 13:37.468
Having somewhere to go
is home.

13:37.468 --> 13:40.080
Having someone to
love is family.

13:40.080 --> 13:42.996
Having both is a blessing.

13:42.996 --> 13:45.433
We all have
families of origin, but

13:45.433 --> 13:48.349
here at Lambda we have
something particularly special.

13:48.349 --> 13:51.265
We don't just have
family, we have sisters.

13:51.265 --> 13:52.832
Yes.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.878
Sisterhood is so many
things.

13:55.878 --> 13:58.446
It's a warm smile, a cheerful
hug,

13:58.446 --> 13:59.839
a friendly hello.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.189
But above all it's a promise

14:02.189 --> 14:05.105
to stick together
and to protect one another,

14:05.105 --> 14:07.237
just like
in a real family.

14:07.237 --> 14:10.327
Now, let's all stand up,
take hands,

14:10.327 --> 14:13.200
and repeat the Lambda pledge.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.331
What is the wonder

14:14.331 --> 14:16.377
Of sisters and friends?

14:16.377 --> 14:19.162
Caring and sharing,
the love never ends.

14:19.162 --> 14:21.077
In our hearts forever,

14:21.077 --> 14:22.992
a memory so true,

14:22.992 --> 14:25.603
Kappa Ada Lambda,
we love you!

14:29.129 --> 14:30.782
-Congratulations, girls.
- Thank you.

14:36.963 --> 14:38.094
Congrats, hey.

14:38.094 --> 14:38.573
SORORITY SISTER 3
Look at this.

14:59.159 --> 15:01.030
Oh-oh, oh shit.

15:01.030 --> 15:04.120
Yeah, just a little bit.

15:04.120 --> 15:05.426
Alright, we're gonna come
to this side.

15:05.426 --> 15:06.906
This gives me nothing to do.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.168
Or or you could get 5.

15:11.606 --> 15:13.695
Kerrie.

15:13.695 --> 15:16.306
Where are you going?

15:16.306 --> 15:17.177
The library.

15:17.177 --> 15:18.830
It's sosh time.

15:18.830 --> 15:21.355
I know, but I have some research

15:21.355 --> 15:23.226
I have to do at the library.

15:23.226 --> 15:25.489
What did I just talk about?

15:25.489 --> 15:27.404
Family is a two-way street,
you can't just

15:27.404 --> 15:28.492
take and take.

15:28.492 --> 15:30.103
I know.

15:30.103 --> 15:33.323
I'm sorry uh,

15:33.323 --> 15:35.412
but the bylaws do allow
for missing sosh time

15:35.412 --> 15:37.632
for academic reasons.

15:37.632 --> 15:40.417
Planning is the key
to success.

15:40.417 --> 15:43.246
We'll talk about this at
our next retreat, okay?

15:43.246 --> 15:45.857
Okay.

15:45.857 --> 15:47.598
Thank you.

16:20.240 --> 16:23.069
Mom, I'm coming home.

16:23.069 --> 16:25.462
I can't stay here.

16:25.462 --> 16:28.117
No, I tried, but I just
can't, okay?

16:28.117 --> 16:30.859
They want me to do
the most horrible things.

16:30.859 --> 16:33.035
Okay, I'll see you soon.

17:10.768 --> 17:12.466
-Could you believe that?
-No.

17:12.466 --> 17:13.728
I mean who says something
like that?

17:13.728 --> 17:16.731
-No.
-It's so weird.

17:18.341 --> 17:19.864
What was that all about?

17:19.864 --> 17:21.344
Oh, that's the sosh
committee.

17:21.344 --> 17:22.737
Sosh committee?

17:22.737 --> 17:23.955
Yeah.

17:23.955 --> 17:26.132
They plan all of our events,
and they travel

17:26.132 --> 17:28.656
around the country for
conferences,

17:28.656 --> 17:31.224
and meet with alumni.

17:31.224 --> 17:33.095
But you don't wanna get
into that, it's incredibly

17:33.095 --> 17:34.575
time-consuming.

17:34.575 --> 17:37.186
Well, if you have
to be able to travel and

17:37.186 --> 17:39.710
shop like that, there's no way
I could.

17:39.710 --> 17:42.757
Well, they actually get
a wardrobe allowance

17:42.757 --> 17:45.629
and their travel expenses
are paid for.

17:45.629 --> 17:47.675
Oh, and they're exempt
from chores.

17:47.675 --> 17:50.069
Yeah.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.680
I know it looks tempting,
but there's a lot of

17:52.680 --> 17:55.030
strings attached.

17:55.030 --> 17:57.989
You're smart, just focus on
your classes.

17:57.989 --> 18:00.514
The sosh committee has a lot
more work than it looks like

18:00.514 --> 18:01.515
than just cleaning
the mess.

18:02.733 --> 18:03.691
What's wrong?

18:03.691 --> 18:04.822
Did you hear about Kerrie?

18:04.822 --> 18:05.997
No, what happened?

18:05.997 --> 18:07.216
She's dead.

18:07.216 --> 18:08.522
What?

18:08.522 --> 18:10.045
Two nights ago, she got hit
by a train

18:10.045 --> 18:11.699
at the station by
accident.

18:11.699 --> 18:14.049
Some people say it wasn't
an accident.

18:14.049 --> 18:15.877
It might have been suicide.

18:15.877 --> 18:17.313
That's terrible!

18:17.313 --> 18:18.967
Why why would
she do that?

18:18.967 --> 18:21.317
Uh, was she going through
a rough time or

18:21.317 --> 18:23.232
The university ethics council
was gonna expel her

18:23.232 --> 18:24.233
for cheating.

18:24.233 --> 18:26.453
That's just a rumor.

18:26.453 --> 18:27.628
The case is under
investigation by

18:27.628 --> 18:28.716
the campus police.

18:28.716 --> 18:29.586
What?

18:29.586 --> 18:33.460
Girls.

18:33.460 --> 18:35.288
I know you all just heard
the terrible news

18:35.288 --> 18:37.290
about Kerrie.

18:37.290 --> 18:38.639
She will be
missed by us all.

18:40.684 --> 18:43.600
In the meantime, we need
to do our best

18:43.600 --> 18:45.298
to carry on,

18:45.298 --> 18:47.952
not dwelling in
fear and despair.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.653
It's it's what Kerrie
would have wanted.

19:01.357 --> 19:03.620
Come on in!

19:08.059 --> 19:09.844
Oh.

19:17.025 --> 19:19.201
Those are bougainvillea.

19:19.201 --> 19:21.856
I had them planted as soon
as this became my room.

19:24.032 --> 19:25.076
Come on in.

19:25.076 --> 19:26.295
I'm getting ready.

19:41.484 --> 19:43.617
You went to Magnolia?

19:43.617 --> 19:44.879
I went to Cheshire?

19:44.879 --> 19:46.968
-We're practically neighbors.
-I know.

19:46.968 --> 19:49.275
That's why I chose
you for my little.

19:49.275 --> 19:51.625
Wow, I guess
I assumed that

19:51.625 --> 19:54.454
That I went to some expensive
private school.

19:54.454 --> 19:56.412
That I come from money.

19:56.412 --> 19:58.980
-It's just some of the girls
-Not me.

19:58.980 --> 20:01.678
My mother is a teacher and
my father well,

20:03.811 --> 20:05.029
never mind.

20:05.029 --> 20:07.815
But if you play your cards
right,

20:07.815 --> 20:10.339
you can have nice
things, too.

20:12.689 --> 20:13.516
Hey.
-Hey.

20:13.516 --> 20:14.778
Have you seen my curling wand?

20:14.778 --> 20:15.649
I'm doing ringlets
for the party.

20:15.649 --> 20:16.998
Try Sierra.

20:16.998 --> 20:18.042
I think she has it.

20:18.042 --> 20:20.175
Okay, thanks.

20:20.175 --> 20:22.525
What a mutation.

20:22.525 --> 20:23.874
Uh, I thought you two
were besties.

20:23.874 --> 20:27.095
I just like to keep
my enemies closer.

20:27.095 --> 20:28.966
There's a lot of girls
here who will do anything

20:28.966 --> 20:31.882
to get ahead, including
bring you down.

20:31.882 --> 20:34.929
Jealousy, you know?

20:34.929 --> 20:36.147
But tonight, I've got
better things to do than

20:36.147 --> 20:38.062
worry about basic Bianca.

20:40.021 --> 20:42.545
Cassie, why aren't
you getting ready?

20:42.545 --> 20:44.025
Uh, for what?

20:44.025 --> 20:45.722
For the white party.

20:45.722 --> 20:46.723
You didn't tell her?

20:46.723 --> 20:48.247
First years aren't invited.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.770
But our Cassie isn't
a little freshman,

20:49.770 --> 20:51.946
I'm sure she knows
how to handle herself.

20:51.946 --> 20:54.557
Uh, I'm sorry,
but what's a white party?

20:54.557 --> 20:57.473
It's one of our most exclusive
events of the year.

20:57.473 --> 21:00.389
It's a great opportunity
to meet alumni,

21:00.389 --> 21:02.913
lineup a summer internship,

21:02.913 --> 21:04.872
find a mentor,

21:04.872 --> 21:06.787
if you're interested in that
kind of thing.

21:06.787 --> 21:09.833
Oh yeah uh, but,
I mean I don't know

21:09.833 --> 21:11.182
if I'd have anything
to wear.

21:11.182 --> 21:12.662
It sounds pretty fancy.

21:12.662 --> 21:15.099
Well, that's what bigs
are for.

21:15.099 --> 21:17.101
You two look like you're
about the same size.

21:18.929 --> 21:20.931
I have just the thing.

21:20.931 --> 21:22.585
You will look amazing.

21:24.892 --> 21:27.198
Do you do you
think we should still be

21:27.198 --> 21:29.026
celebrating after what
happened to Kerrie?

21:29.026 --> 21:30.985
The show must go on.

21:45.521 --> 21:47.306
Cassie.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.177
Hey, um, wow,
you look amazing!

21:49.177 --> 21:50.352
Oh.

21:50.352 --> 21:51.919
I wasn't expecting
to see you here.

21:51.919 --> 21:54.487
Uh, you're here just
to network, right?

21:54.487 --> 21:55.444
Of course, what else?

21:55.444 --> 21:56.532
Good.

21:56.532 --> 21:58.012
Keep it that way.

21:58.012 --> 22:00.797
It's just you can lose
track of your goals really

22:00.797 --> 22:02.669
easily here with so many
attractive alternatives

22:02.669 --> 22:04.061
so

22:04.061 --> 22:05.454
Just enjoy, okay?

22:05.454 --> 22:06.760
Okay.

22:13.549 --> 22:14.333
Don't say a word.

22:14.333 --> 22:15.595
I have just the thing.

22:16.987 --> 22:19.555
So you're new here?

22:19.555 --> 22:21.209
I haven't seen
you here before.

22:21.209 --> 22:23.951
Uh, yeah,
this is my first time.

22:23.951 --> 22:26.127
Is it usually this packed?

22:26.127 --> 22:27.824
Yeah, usually.

22:27.824 --> 22:29.348
Are you the only bartender?

22:29.348 --> 22:31.262
Oh, well, just kinda seems
to work out that way

22:31.262 --> 22:33.830
sometimes, but
I know not to complain.

22:33.830 --> 22:36.442
More money for you.

22:36.442 --> 22:38.182
Yeah, well, that's the idea.

22:39.445 --> 22:42.404
Cosmo.

22:42.404 --> 22:44.624
Pretty drink for
a prettier girl.

22:46.147 --> 22:47.104
It's my specialty.

22:47.104 --> 22:48.715
Thank you.

22:48.715 --> 22:50.673
Cassie.

22:50.673 --> 22:51.674
There is someone I'd
like you to meet.

22:51.674 --> 22:53.676
Uh, cheers.

22:58.551 --> 23:00.335
This is Simon Hughes.

23:00.335 --> 23:03.120
He's an alumna of Omicron
and VP of distribution for

23:03.120 --> 23:04.557
Red Pharmaceuticals.

23:04.557 --> 23:05.862
Nice to meet you.

23:05.862 --> 23:06.646
-Oh, um.
-Um.

23:06.646 --> 23:08.387
Oh.

23:08.387 --> 23:09.997
Nice to meet you.

23:09.997 --> 23:12.565
Given Cassie's major in
healthcare administration,

23:12.565 --> 23:15.132
I thought you'd have a lot
to talk about.

23:15.132 --> 23:17.004
Um, uh, thank you.

23:19.006 --> 23:21.051
Uh, she's right.

23:21.051 --> 23:22.226
Uh, I'm writing a paper on
pharmaceutical

23:22.226 --> 23:23.314
distribution.

23:23.314 --> 23:24.838
I'm a supply chain junkie.

23:26.753 --> 23:28.232
Maybe it's the wrong way
to put that

23:28.232 --> 23:29.059
I think it's perfect.

23:40.767 --> 23:43.683
Well, as I'm sure you know,
medicines are sourced

23:43.683 --> 23:45.249
from ingredients
from around the world

23:45.249 --> 23:47.077
and then the final
formulations get exported

23:47.077 --> 23:50.211
worldwide, meaning
the packaging, repackaging,

23:50.211 --> 23:52.213
and sales can happen in many
different countries, yeah.

23:52.213 --> 23:54.345
Yeah, and every transaction

23:54.345 --> 23:56.043
is an opportunity
for falsified products

23:56.043 --> 23:57.174
to infiltrate the market.

23:57.174 --> 23:58.175
Exactly.

23:58.175 --> 23:59.350
Oh.

23:59.350 --> 24:00.526
Are you okay?

24:00.526 --> 24:02.789
Oh yeah, I'm just um,
a little dizzy.

24:02.789 --> 24:04.094
-Um
-Do you wanna get some air?

24:04.094 --> 24:05.922
-I excuse me
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:05.922 --> 24:07.184
-Excuse me
- No, I can help.

24:07.184 --> 24:08.272
I have to go.

24:11.058 --> 24:13.756
I'm so sorry.

24:43.612 --> 24:45.135
Come off yet.

24:58.540 --> 25:00.760
Hey,
are you okay?

25:00.760 --> 25:02.022
Whoa.

25:02.022 --> 25:03.545
-Um.
-Oh.

25:03.545 --> 25:04.938
Uh, hydrogen peroxide
and soap will get that out

25:04.938 --> 25:06.896
-in a flash.
-What?

25:06.896 --> 25:09.290
Look, can I walk you home?

25:35.403 --> 25:36.447
Oh.

25:36.447 --> 25:37.666
Hey, baby.

25:37.666 --> 25:39.581
Whoa, where you going?

25:39.581 --> 25:41.801
Somebody's been partying
a little hard tonight, huh?

25:41.801 --> 25:43.324
You wanna come
party with me?

25:43.324 --> 25:44.804
Whoa, hey, you wanna meet
my boys right here?

25:44.804 --> 25:45.935
This is Vaughn.

25:45.935 --> 25:46.806
Hey, where are you going?

25:46.806 --> 25:48.372
Hey, come here.

25:48.372 --> 25:50.940
Listen, we go Listen,
we go back to my place and

25:50.940 --> 25:52.115
have a couple of drinks.

25:52.115 --> 25:53.769
I'll show you a good
time, come over.

25:53.769 --> 25:54.640
Hey, where are you going?

25:54.640 --> 25:56.337
Baby, come on!

26:22.711 --> 26:25.671
Miss, you okay?

26:29.675 --> 26:31.459
Miss.

26:36.159 --> 26:37.204
What's your name?

26:37.204 --> 26:40.337
Um, Cassie Thompson.

26:40.337 --> 26:42.601
Looks like you've had one too
many, Cassie Thompson.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.124
-I'm gonna have to write you up.
-I no, no.

26:44.124 --> 26:45.604
I'm 21.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.997
Public intoxication is an ethics
council violation.

26:47.997 --> 26:49.825
But I only had one drink.

26:49.825 --> 26:51.261
I was I was
at the white

26:51.261 --> 26:52.088
-The white party.
-Party.

26:52.088 --> 26:53.089
Yeah.

26:53.089 --> 26:54.438
You're a Lambda.

26:54.438 --> 26:56.092
Yeah.

26:56.092 --> 26:57.877
Why didn't you say so?

26:57.877 --> 27:00.053
Come on, let's
get you home.

27:07.321 --> 27:09.018
-Bit too much fun last night?
-Uh.

27:09.018 --> 27:13.153
Actually, I think Cassie might
have been roofied.

27:13.153 --> 27:15.068
Oh, but I but I had
my drink the whole time.

27:15.068 --> 27:17.200
It only takes a second.

27:17.200 --> 27:19.899
Or it could have been in
your drink when you got it.

27:19.899 --> 27:21.988
Some cretins think that
kinda thing is funny.

27:21.988 --> 27:24.686
At one of our parties?

27:24.686 --> 27:26.862
Maybe you forgot to eat
something beforehand.

27:26.862 --> 27:28.429
Top shelf can
have quite a kick.

27:28.429 --> 27:30.474
Maybe.

27:30.474 --> 27:31.737
I've been pretty busy.

27:31.737 --> 27:34.435
Now, you know to be
more careful next time.

27:34.435 --> 27:37.003
Think I might
just stick to club soda.

27:37.003 --> 27:39.440
Simon Hughes was
impressed with you.

27:39.440 --> 27:41.094
He's looking for a summer
intern.

27:41.094 --> 27:44.097
Excellent salary and
quite a bit of travel.

27:44.097 --> 27:45.794
You could see the world
and get paid to do it.

27:45.794 --> 27:47.404
Really?

27:47.404 --> 27:49.755
Oh, I'm so glad I didn't
make him mad.

27:49.755 --> 27:51.931
Think I kind of
rushed off last night.

27:53.106 --> 27:54.281
Oh, I've gotta go.

27:54.281 --> 27:55.586
I got brunch with my mom.

27:55.586 --> 27:57.066
Oh.

27:57.066 --> 27:59.416
Maybe you should just take
it easy today.

27:59.416 --> 28:01.375
It's the only time we can see
each other all week,

28:01.375 --> 28:03.551
But you have chores
and studying as well.

28:03.551 --> 28:06.336
I'm sure your mom
will understand.

28:06.336 --> 28:08.469
No, it's our thing.

28:08.469 --> 28:10.340
I'll fit it all in somehow.

28:18.131 --> 28:19.523
Are you sure you don't want
anything to eat?

28:19.523 --> 28:21.351
Oh yeah, I'm fine.

28:23.092 --> 28:24.790
What's wrong, honey?

28:24.790 --> 28:27.531
You're not coming down
with something, are you?

28:27.531 --> 28:30.491
No, no,
it's nothing like that.

28:30.491 --> 28:32.711
And those rich sorority girls,

28:32.711 --> 28:35.670
they're not keeping you up
with their partying I hope.

28:35.670 --> 28:37.324
You know, how important
your sleep is, especially

28:37.324 --> 28:38.891
with your hectic schedule.

28:38.891 --> 28:40.327
No, I had
an early night.

28:40.327 --> 28:42.938
It's just um

28:42.938 --> 28:45.027
Uh, they served tuna tartare

28:45.027 --> 28:46.463
at an alumni event
last night.

28:46.463 --> 28:47.900
Oh.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.340
Okay, but I can still see
there's something else

28:53.340 --> 28:54.167
that's bothering you.

28:54.167 --> 28:55.342
Oh.

28:56.996 --> 28:58.911
Maybe Lambda wasn't
quite what you hoped.

28:58.911 --> 29:01.217
No, uh,
Lambda's great.

29:01.217 --> 29:02.697
Really great, actually.

29:02.697 --> 29:04.786
And the girls?

29:04.786 --> 29:07.049
They're actually really nice and
I'm learning

29:07.049 --> 29:09.965
a lot, and it's
such a relief to know that

29:09.965 --> 29:11.967
we don't have to
worry about housing.

29:11.967 --> 29:14.187
You don't have to worry
about it, so

29:18.147 --> 29:20.367
Hey, you know, you can always
talk to me, right?

29:21.542 --> 29:23.849
I know.

29:23.849 --> 29:25.372
Everything's fine really.

29:25.372 --> 29:28.331
It's it's just uh,

29:28.331 --> 29:31.291
Lambda's a different world
and I need to find

29:31.291 --> 29:33.554
my own way in it.

29:33.554 --> 29:34.860
-Okay.
-Yeah.

29:55.532 --> 29:58.361
Remember me?

29:58.361 --> 30:00.102
Cosmo girl.

30:00.102 --> 30:01.408
It's good to see you.

30:01.408 --> 30:02.539
How are you?

30:02.539 --> 30:04.324
I've been better.

30:04.324 --> 30:05.891
But tell me what did
you put in my drink?

30:05.891 --> 30:08.371
Oh, um, vodka,
lime juice, cranberry juice,

30:08.371 --> 30:09.416
and triple sec.

30:09.416 --> 30:10.417
Standard cosmo.

30:10.417 --> 30:11.592
Yeah.

30:11.592 --> 30:13.376
And do roofies come
standard, too?

30:13.376 --> 30:14.421
What?

30:14.421 --> 30:15.378
Are you kidding?

30:16.815 --> 30:18.120
You tried to take me home.

30:18.120 --> 30:19.861
'Cause you could barely stand.

30:19.861 --> 30:21.602
I figured you pre-gamed
toward it and needed help.

30:21.602 --> 30:23.560
Oh, and you were conveniently
there to give it to me.

30:23.560 --> 30:24.866
No, listen to me.

30:24.866 --> 30:26.215
I've got enough to do with
classes, and studying,

30:26.215 --> 30:28.652
and working nights to
make ends meet.

30:28.652 --> 30:31.438
Why do you think I bartend
snotty Greek events for fun?

30:31.438 --> 30:33.048
No. Uh, of course, not.

30:33.048 --> 30:34.223
-I mean
-No, it's not funny.

30:34.223 --> 30:36.051
The last thing I need is
some drunk sorority girl

30:36.051 --> 30:38.793
getting me in trouble
with the ethics council.

30:38.793 --> 30:40.839
Or the cops.

30:42.362 --> 30:45.234
Besides, would I give you
laundry advice

30:45.234 --> 30:47.323
if I planned to assault
you?

30:47.323 --> 30:49.760
-You did?
-You really don't remember?

30:49.760 --> 30:52.763
I guess I kinda do.

30:52.763 --> 30:54.809
But but somebody put
something in my drink.

30:54.809 --> 30:56.855
I really did
just have one.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.769
Did you get home, alright?

30:58.769 --> 31:01.250
Yeah, a campus
cop gave me a ride.

31:02.643 --> 31:04.210
I hate to say it,
but it does sound like you

31:04.210 --> 31:05.689
were roofied.

31:05.689 --> 31:07.648
You're a sorority girl and
a sophomore, which makes

31:07.648 --> 31:08.997
you a target.

31:08.997 --> 31:10.303
How do you know that?

31:10.303 --> 31:14.002
I give campus security talks
each semester.

31:14.002 --> 31:15.961
Got any tips other than never
leaving my room again?

31:17.005 --> 31:18.398
Yeah.

31:18.398 --> 31:19.790
Uh, try bottled drinks
that you open yourself.

31:21.488 --> 31:23.707
That way you'll know it's not
tainted and it's harder

31:23.707 --> 31:25.013
to slip something in
when you're not looking.

31:25.013 --> 31:27.624
Thanks.

31:27.624 --> 31:29.975
Look, I'm sorry
I accused you.

31:31.193 --> 31:33.979
Is that is that O Chem?

31:33.979 --> 31:35.632
Wait, I'm in that class,
but I've never seen you.

31:35.632 --> 31:38.679
Yeah, well, I am.

31:38.679 --> 31:39.985
I sit it in the back

31:39.985 --> 31:41.377
And I keep my head down.

31:41.377 --> 31:43.336
The only way any of this
gets in my thick skull.

31:46.252 --> 31:48.732
Uh uh, maybe we could study
sometime.

31:48.732 --> 31:51.083
Sure.

31:51.083 --> 31:53.172
Yeah, I need all the help
I can get.

31:53.172 --> 31:55.130
Actually, um,

31:55.130 --> 31:58.046
I could use some help
right now.

31:58.046 --> 31:59.830
-Okay.
-Okay.

32:00.831 --> 32:02.746
You first.

32:32.037 --> 32:34.039
Miss Mathers.

32:34.039 --> 32:36.128
Hello, Lisa.

32:36.128 --> 32:37.956
I'm so sorry.

32:37.956 --> 32:40.610
I'm sure everybody
at Lambda is very sorry.

32:42.003 --> 32:44.005
Did you hear what
they're saying?

32:44.005 --> 32:47.139
They're saying Kerrie cheated
and she killed herself.

32:47.139 --> 32:50.011
Kerrie was very smart,
she didn't need to cheat.

32:50.011 --> 32:51.882
I know she was
worried about her grades.

32:51.882 --> 32:54.233
Lambda was supposed
to be a way to help her pay

32:54.233 --> 32:56.409
her tuition, but instead

32:59.064 --> 33:01.892
Don't you think it's strange how
quickly rumors become facts

33:01.892 --> 33:04.025
in a place like this?

33:04.025 --> 33:05.896
I'm sure
no one really believed.

33:05.896 --> 33:08.987
I contacted the
police, the real police,

33:08.987 --> 33:12.120
not these campus clowns,
and I told them Kerrie did

33:12.120 --> 33:14.340
not kill herself,
she was murdered.

33:14.340 --> 33:16.820
Murdered?

33:16.820 --> 33:18.692
I have proof.

33:18.692 --> 33:20.172
She was worried about
something much more than

33:20.172 --> 33:22.435
grades, something
much worse.

33:22.435 --> 33:23.523
What?

33:23.523 --> 33:25.090
I can't
talk about it.

33:25.090 --> 33:28.223
It's a police
investigation now.

33:28.223 --> 33:30.530
I like you, Lisa, but you
should watch your back.

33:31.748 --> 33:33.620
You both should.

33:33.620 --> 33:35.709
You're not safe in
a place like this.

33:36.884 --> 33:38.538
No one is.

33:42.672 --> 33:44.152
I better go talk to Monica.

33:50.115 --> 33:51.638
Cassie.

33:51.638 --> 33:54.075
-Oh.
-It's good to see you.

33:54.075 --> 33:56.164
I was doing some senior
recruiting on campus

33:56.164 --> 33:58.253
when I saw you
all over here.

33:58.253 --> 34:01.126
Uh, yeah, it's a
it's a memorial for a sister

34:01.126 --> 34:02.605
who passed away recently.

34:02.605 --> 34:03.650
Oh, I'm so sorry.

34:03.650 --> 34:04.825
What happened?

34:04.825 --> 34:07.697
Uh, an accident, I think.

34:07.697 --> 34:10.352
Um, I'm sorry I had to leave so
abruptly the other night,

34:10.352 --> 34:12.050
Oh, that's alright,

34:12.050 --> 34:13.312
but I was enjoying
our conversation.

34:13.312 --> 34:15.836
Me, too.

34:15.836 --> 34:17.490
Uh, Wendy might have told you
I'm doing some hiring

34:17.490 --> 34:18.578
this summer.

34:18.578 --> 34:20.406
Uh, yeah,
she mentioned that.

34:20.406 --> 34:22.495
It it sounds like
a wonderful opportunity.

34:22.495 --> 34:24.149
I'm so glad you think so.

34:24.149 --> 34:26.847
Go ahead and contact my office,
and set up a dinner.

34:26.847 --> 34:29.023
I'd love to pick up
where we left off.

34:29.023 --> 34:30.894
Okay.

34:40.034 --> 34:41.122
You wanted to see me?

34:41.122 --> 34:43.081
Cassie, have a seat.

34:46.345 --> 34:49.217
You did a wonderful job
with the memorial.

34:49.217 --> 34:51.524
The energy and
commitment you showed.

34:51.524 --> 34:52.699
Thanks.

34:52.699 --> 34:53.874
I was happy to help.

34:53.874 --> 34:55.267
I have good news.

34:55.267 --> 34:57.399
I'd like you to join
the sosh committee.

34:57.399 --> 34:59.836
Our big masquerade gala is
not too far off

34:59.836 --> 35:01.925
and I know
your organizational skills

35:01.925 --> 35:03.666
are just what we need.

35:03.666 --> 35:06.147
But I'm still a neo.

35:06.147 --> 35:08.236
I thought committee
members had to be sisters

35:08.236 --> 35:10.499
for at least a year.

35:10.499 --> 35:13.285
There are always exceptions
for the exceptional,

35:13.285 --> 35:14.895
unless you're not interested,
of course.

35:14.895 --> 35:16.679
No, no, I am.

35:16.679 --> 35:18.507
Monica and Bianca will take you
clothes shopping

35:18.507 --> 35:19.726
for the Panhellenic
Conference in

35:19.726 --> 35:21.815
Washington this weekend.

35:21.815 --> 35:24.296
I hope you like to
travel first class.

35:24.296 --> 35:27.777
First cl how can Lambda
afford that?

35:27.777 --> 35:29.562
Our alumni sponsors
are very generous.

35:29.562 --> 35:31.303
We call them our "angels".

35:31.303 --> 35:34.262
Does does
that include Simon?

35:34.262 --> 35:35.916
I can't say.

35:35.916 --> 35:38.136
Our angels are
completely anonymous.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.181
But don't worry they can
afford to spoil us

35:40.181 --> 35:41.356
and they do.

35:41.356 --> 35:42.966
I still don't know
what to think.

35:42.966 --> 35:45.491
The truth is I didn't come
from money either,

35:45.491 --> 35:48.102
but getting into Lambda
changed my life,

35:48.102 --> 35:50.452
opened up a whole new world.

35:50.452 --> 35:51.845
It can do the same
for you.

35:55.762 --> 35:58.286
Ladies, meet the newest
member of our sosh committee.

36:00.462 --> 36:01.768
Congratulations!

36:01.768 --> 36:03.596
Cassie, that's amazing.

36:03.596 --> 36:05.728
Yeah, that's wow!

36:05.728 --> 36:07.295
Just wow!

36:07.295 --> 36:09.254
Cassie's gonna need clothes
for everything.

36:09.254 --> 36:13.083
Travel, dinners, you name it,
including a cocktail dress.

36:13.083 --> 36:15.651
She has a dinner interview
with a very important alumnus.

36:15.651 --> 36:17.610
Who's the alum?

36:17.610 --> 36:19.481
That's between Cassie
and her alum.

36:19.481 --> 36:21.266
You know the drill.

36:21.266 --> 36:22.745
Yes, of course.

36:22.745 --> 36:24.791
Good.

36:24.791 --> 36:26.793
Call me if you
need anything.

36:26.793 --> 36:28.360
Cassie, you have
a great time.

36:37.673 --> 36:39.893
-This?
-Yes.

36:46.334 --> 36:48.684
-Okay, so we're looking for this
-I found this outfit.

36:50.947 --> 36:52.340
I love it, I love it,
absolutely.

36:52.340 --> 36:53.341
It's so cute, but you
know what's cuter?

37:07.050 --> 37:09.401
I can't believe you made sosh
committee already!

37:09.401 --> 37:11.751
We are gonna have
so much fun.

37:11.751 --> 37:13.622
Wait, we are?

37:13.622 --> 37:15.537
Wendy, let
me know yesterday.

37:15.537 --> 37:17.191
And I wasn't gonna say
anything, but I had a feeling

37:17.191 --> 37:19.802
she was gonna ask you,
too.

37:19.802 --> 37:21.151
This is so exciting!

37:22.762 --> 37:24.677
So I guess that answers
that question.

37:24.677 --> 37:26.461
What are you talking about?

37:26.461 --> 37:29.072
You know, you're really smart
and you talk a good game,

37:29.072 --> 37:30.770
but in the end you're just like
the rest of them.

37:35.078 --> 37:38.081
Don't listen to her,
she's just jealous.

37:38.081 --> 37:39.822
Well, it doesn't seem quite
fair that the sosh committee

37:39.822 --> 37:42.608
gets so much

37:42.608 --> 37:44.000
and some girls don't get
anything.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.306
They're still getting tuition
assistance

37:45.306 --> 37:47.221
and everything else.

37:47.221 --> 37:49.136
The ones who need it anyway.

37:49.136 --> 37:51.573
That's so cute.

37:51.573 --> 37:53.967
You can't do this to me.

37:55.403 --> 37:56.622
No, no, no, no,
please, please,

37:56.622 --> 37:58.493
I can do better,
I promise.

38:00.800 --> 38:02.845
But you said.

38:04.369 --> 38:06.936
You promised me!

38:09.112 --> 38:11.158
Hello?

38:13.769 --> 38:16.163
Hello?

39:31.456 --> 39:33.066
Hi, sweetheart.

39:33.066 --> 39:34.763
How are you?

39:34.763 --> 39:36.374
You'll never guess
what I've been doing.

39:36.374 --> 39:37.462
Tell me what.

39:37.462 --> 39:40.290
Well, I went shopping
and

39:40.290 --> 39:42.554
ta-daa!

39:42.554 --> 39:45.252
Cassie, what is all that?

39:45.252 --> 39:46.471
Oh, don't worry,
I didn't pay for it.

39:46.471 --> 39:47.950
Lambda did.

39:47.950 --> 39:50.736
Well, their sponsors,
alumni angels, you know?

39:50.736 --> 39:52.564
No, I'm afraid I don't.

39:52.564 --> 39:53.956
Is that a Chanel bag?

39:53.956 --> 39:55.131
Yes.

39:55.131 --> 39:57.003
Oh, and look.

40:01.224 --> 40:04.010
Oh, wow, that is beautiful!

40:04.010 --> 40:06.055
I bet it looks
gorgeous on you.

40:06.055 --> 40:08.014
What event is that for?

40:08.014 --> 40:09.102
Oh, I've got an interview.

40:09.102 --> 40:10.495
Oh.

40:10.495 --> 40:12.975
Uh, Cassie, that is not
the right sort of dress

40:12.975 --> 40:14.412
for an interview.

40:14.412 --> 40:15.891
Well, it's a dinner
interview.

40:15.891 --> 40:18.372
Casual, but upscale,
you know?

40:18.372 --> 40:21.027
Honey, you wanna
look professional and

40:21.027 --> 40:23.682
let's just say

40:23.682 --> 40:25.640
That is not the impression
that dress makes.

40:25.640 --> 40:27.294
They didn't buy you
a business suit?

40:31.733 --> 40:33.343
Okay.

40:33.343 --> 40:35.433
Ready for the big interview?

40:37.260 --> 40:39.045
What?

40:41.526 --> 40:43.310
What are you wearing?

40:43.310 --> 40:45.921
I thought Monica bought
you a cocktail dress.

40:45.921 --> 40:48.663
Yeah, but I wanna
look professional.

40:48.663 --> 40:49.708
Uh, my mom bought me this
suit for interviews

40:49.708 --> 40:51.753
last summer, so

40:53.668 --> 40:56.758
Your mother has the best
intentions,

40:56.758 --> 40:58.760
but I mean she works
in a nursing home,

40:58.760 --> 41:00.153
doesn't she?

41:00.153 --> 41:01.546
So?

41:01.546 --> 41:04.070
She doesn't understand
how our world works.

41:04.070 --> 41:06.768
The world you're moving
into now.

41:06.768 --> 41:08.378
You're interviewing Simon
just as much as he's

41:08.378 --> 41:09.858
interviewing you.

41:09.858 --> 41:10.903
What do you mean?

41:10.903 --> 41:12.731
Do you admire his values,

41:12.731 --> 41:14.646
his work ethic?

41:14.646 --> 41:17.083
Would you like to spend
the summer working with him?

41:17.083 --> 41:19.389
Do you even like Simon?

41:19.389 --> 41:22.436
I have only met him twice.

41:22.436 --> 41:25.395
Cassie, it's very
important that we maintain

41:25.395 --> 41:28.398
a good relationship with
our alumni network,

41:28.398 --> 41:30.879
not just for your sake, but
for the sake of all

41:30.879 --> 41:32.577
the girls who'll come after.

41:32.577 --> 41:34.274
I don't wanna let
anybody down.

41:34.274 --> 41:35.971
Good.

41:35.971 --> 41:37.625
Don't ruin this
for your sisters.

41:37.625 --> 41:39.366
We're all family
after all.

41:39.366 --> 41:41.934
Wear the dress.

41:41.934 --> 41:44.893
Own the room
and the interview,

41:44.893 --> 41:47.374
and don't look back.

42:24.759 --> 42:26.587
Um, I'm here
to see Simon Hughes.

42:26.587 --> 42:28.023
It's open.

42:28.023 --> 42:29.851
Okay.

42:49.697 --> 42:51.133
Huh.

42:51.133 --> 42:53.048
Apologies.

42:53.048 --> 42:54.267
I didn't mean to startle you,

42:54.267 --> 42:56.704
but I am impressed
with your reflexes.

42:56.704 --> 42:58.706
Uh, you should
see me with nunchucks.

42:58.706 --> 43:00.055
You look beautiful.

43:00.055 --> 43:02.188
Oh, thank you.

43:02.188 --> 43:05.104
Oh, you look uh,
nice, too.

43:05.104 --> 43:07.236
Uh, I thought we were meeting
in your office.

43:07.236 --> 43:08.716
This is my home office.

43:08.716 --> 43:10.370
My regular office is too
noisy and we have so much

43:10.370 --> 43:12.241
to talk about.

43:14.374 --> 43:15.636
Please.

43:15.636 --> 43:16.898
Uh, yeah, of course.

43:22.251 --> 43:23.688
Okay.

43:37.136 --> 43:38.790
Would you like some
champagne?

43:38.790 --> 43:41.531
Or um, if you prefer,
red wine?

43:41.531 --> 43:44.012
Oh, I'm good with water.

43:44.012 --> 43:45.405
-You sure?
-Yeah.

43:57.504 --> 44:00.507
This view is incredible.

44:00.507 --> 44:03.684
Yes, incredible.

44:03.684 --> 44:06.426
Well, I hope you
like lobster.

44:10.517 --> 44:12.737
Bon appétit.

44:14.869 --> 44:17.872
So

44:17.872 --> 44:20.570
when last we spoke

44:20.570 --> 44:22.224
you were sharing
your fascination

44:22.224 --> 44:24.226
with the supply chain,
which is surprising

44:24.226 --> 44:26.925
for someone your age,
certainly.

44:26.925 --> 44:29.884
People have a tendency to vilify
pharmaceutical companies

44:29.884 --> 44:32.147
without looking deeply into
the many ways

44:32.147 --> 44:33.888
they make our lives better.

44:33.888 --> 44:35.629
And there are so many ways
they make much better.

44:35.629 --> 44:37.326
Yeah.

44:37.326 --> 44:38.937
I mean these days everyone
just wants to write them off

44:38.937 --> 44:40.416
as peddling designer drugs

44:40.416 --> 44:42.636
or like they're simply faceless
machines

44:42.636 --> 44:45.204
only driven by profit
when many of the

44:45.204 --> 44:47.336
best companies
have very specific

44:47.336 --> 44:49.121
humanitarian aims written
into their charters.

44:51.950 --> 44:53.778
You're a very
passionate young woman.

44:55.040 --> 44:57.825
Health care means
a lot to me.

44:57.825 --> 44:59.522
My mom showed me just
how big of a difference

44:59.522 --> 45:01.611
quality care can make
in people's lives.

45:01.611 --> 45:04.614
I'm a passionate man, too.

45:06.312 --> 45:08.618
Um.

45:08.618 --> 45:10.011
Oh.

45:13.580 --> 45:15.016
I have to take this.

45:15.016 --> 45:16.452
Hello.

45:16.452 --> 45:17.976
No, you don't you don't
you don't have to go.

45:20.543 --> 45:22.023
What?

45:31.076 --> 45:33.643
Hey, it's me.

45:33.643 --> 45:35.950
Uh, Charlie.

45:35.950 --> 45:38.344
Wondered if you still needed
a study buddy for tonight.

45:38.344 --> 45:39.301
Oh yeah, sure.

45:40.563 --> 45:43.349
You okay?

45:43.349 --> 45:45.743
Uh, I'm on campus
near the library and

45:47.005 --> 45:48.180
I'm okay.

45:48.180 --> 45:49.224
-I just um
- Uh, look I just

45:49.224 --> 45:50.660
got out of the chem lab nearby.

45:50.660 --> 45:52.575
I can uh, I'm right by
the library, I can meet

45:52.575 --> 45:54.969
-you there, okay?
-No, it's okay.

45:54.969 --> 45:56.362
I'll meet you there,
alright?

45:56.362 --> 45:57.755
Okay.

46:20.386 --> 46:22.257
Cassie, look out!

46:34.704 --> 46:36.532
Are you okay?

46:36.532 --> 46:37.533
Uh, yeah.

46:37.533 --> 46:38.883
Yeah, I'm okay.

46:38.883 --> 46:40.536
Just just a little shaken.

46:40.536 --> 46:43.104
If I'd have been there
when that brick fell

46:43.104 --> 46:45.890
No, before that.

46:45.890 --> 46:48.327
Why were you crying
when I called?

46:49.589 --> 46:52.331
Please, just talk to me.

46:55.813 --> 46:57.945
I had an interview

46:59.599 --> 47:00.948
and the alum
I was interviewing for

47:03.690 --> 47:05.431
he um, he pulled down
my dress and

47:08.521 --> 47:11.785
-Go on.
-I'm so stupid.

47:11.785 --> 47:13.526
He said he wanted to meet
at his house because his

47:13.526 --> 47:16.616
office was too loud and
I totally believed him.

47:16.616 --> 47:17.704
Should have known
a private dinner wouldn't

47:17.704 --> 47:19.662
-end any other way.
-No, that's not your fault.

47:22.274 --> 47:23.231
Who was it?

47:23.231 --> 47:24.754
No.

47:24.754 --> 47:26.452
No, Charlie, you
shouldn't get involved.

47:26.452 --> 47:28.976
Listen to me.

47:28.976 --> 47:30.673
I am involved.

47:35.940 --> 47:38.725
Look, it's okay if you
don't wanna tell me, but

47:39.944 --> 47:42.685
You gotta talk about it
with somebody.

47:45.732 --> 47:47.560
Who do you trust the most?

47:47.560 --> 47:48.561
My mom.

47:52.782 --> 47:53.958
It does me good to see
you eat.

47:56.264 --> 47:59.006
Oh, before I forget,
I brought you the usual.

47:59.006 --> 48:01.182
Thanks, mom.

48:01.182 --> 48:03.706
Um, I don't need the
soap or quarters.

48:03.706 --> 48:05.317
Lambda has laundry service.

48:05.317 --> 48:06.840
Oh, someone's moving on up.

48:08.450 --> 48:11.018
Actually most of my clothes are
dry clean only now,

48:13.281 --> 48:16.284
Okay, well, I just
wanted to help, so

48:16.284 --> 48:19.113
Uh, oh, but I'll
take the granola bars.

48:20.636 --> 48:21.942
I can never find these
on campus

48:21.942 --> 48:23.291
and you always remember
they're my favorite.

48:23.291 --> 48:25.119
Thank you.

48:25.119 --> 48:27.426
Wow, your watch,
it's shiny.

48:28.644 --> 48:30.777
Yeah.

48:30.777 --> 48:32.561
Just another perk
of bein' Lambda.

48:37.566 --> 48:39.394
What's wrong?

48:39.394 --> 48:41.701
Oh, nothing.

48:41.701 --> 48:43.921
Um, I think Wendy's here.

48:47.054 --> 48:49.578
Hello, Cassie.

48:49.578 --> 48:52.016
And hello
Debra, isn't it?

48:52.016 --> 48:54.192
It's good to
see you again.

48:54.192 --> 48:55.976
Nice to see you, too.

48:55.976 --> 48:57.760
Cassie and I were
we're just catching up.

48:57.760 --> 48:59.675
She was telling me how the
sorority gave her money

48:59.675 --> 49:01.808
to buy that watch.

49:01.808 --> 49:03.549
Yes, it's part of
her wardrobe allowance.

49:03.549 --> 49:05.029
I know.

49:05.029 --> 49:06.552
Now that Cassie's
on the sosh committee,

49:06.552 --> 49:09.511
she's not only required to
plan events,

49:09.511 --> 49:11.557
she's also expected to travel
around the country

49:11.557 --> 49:13.994
and meet with alumni.

49:13.994 --> 49:15.474
Sounds important.

49:15.474 --> 49:18.390
Yes, normally first-year
recruits aren't asked,

49:18.390 --> 49:20.696
but we made an
exception in Cassie's case.

49:21.871 --> 49:24.309
Well, she is exceptional.

49:24.309 --> 49:27.355
Such a lovely coincidence
to see you both.

49:27.355 --> 49:29.749
Now please enjoy your
brunch and Cassie,

49:29.749 --> 49:30.880
I will see you later.

49:30.880 --> 49:32.099
Okay.

49:38.671 --> 49:40.412
I don't like her.

49:40.412 --> 49:41.804
Mom.

49:41.804 --> 49:43.589
What look, honey, I look,
I know the sorority

49:43.589 --> 49:46.766
is important to
you, but there's just

49:46.766 --> 49:49.551
something about that woman
that gives me the creeps.

49:49.551 --> 49:51.118
It's just something
odd about her.

49:51.118 --> 49:53.468
Mom, please.

49:53.468 --> 49:54.904
Now, tell me what
did you wanna talk about?

49:54.904 --> 49:57.298
You sounded so strange
over the phone.

49:57.298 --> 50:00.171
Oh, uh
It's nothing.

50:00.171 --> 50:01.607
I just I wanted
to see you.

50:01.607 --> 50:03.217
Oh.

50:03.217 --> 50:05.828
I've been so busy
and especially

50:05.828 --> 50:08.527
since I missed last time,
I hope that's okay.

50:08.527 --> 50:10.485
Hey, of course,
it's okay.

50:10.485 --> 50:11.747
Okay.

50:11.747 --> 50:13.053
And you're still
being careful, right?

50:13.053 --> 50:14.968
-Of course.
-Okay.

50:14.968 --> 50:17.318
It's just I heard
the police believe

50:17.318 --> 50:20.234
that Lambda girl
didn't jump,

50:20.234 --> 50:22.280
that she was pushed.

50:22.280 --> 50:24.934
Now, they're warning students
about a pusher killer.

50:26.632 --> 50:29.635
It's my job to keep you
safe and it's your job

50:29.635 --> 50:31.376
To help you keep me safe.

50:31.376 --> 50:33.291
-Right.
-I know.

50:33.291 --> 50:35.684
Promise me, please,
promise me you're not

50:35.684 --> 50:38.470
gonna go out
alone at night.

50:38.470 --> 50:39.775
I promise.

50:39.775 --> 50:40.776
Okay.

50:40.776 --> 50:41.951
Okay.

50:55.965 --> 50:57.097
What's going on?

50:57.097 --> 50:58.794
Where's my stuff?

50:58.794 --> 51:00.622
You've been moved.

51:00.622 --> 51:02.102
Moved?

51:02.102 --> 51:04.931
But who moved me?

51:07.368 --> 51:09.718
Lisa, are you okay?

51:09.718 --> 51:12.678
I'm fine.

51:12.678 --> 51:15.376
Look, I know I've been
distracted, but

51:17.030 --> 51:18.292
ever since we got back
from the conference,

51:18.292 --> 51:20.294
you've been,

51:20.294 --> 51:23.036
I don't know, quiet,
withdrawn even.

51:26.170 --> 51:27.823
I'm fine.

51:27.823 --> 51:30.304
I just have a lot
of work to do.

51:30.304 --> 51:32.480
And the girl said you were
supposed to be moved.

51:32.480 --> 51:34.395
So go ask Wendy if you
need to know more.

51:51.717 --> 51:52.892
What's going on?

51:52.892 --> 51:54.633
Oh, my stuff, it's all gone.

51:54.633 --> 51:57.418
Not gone, just moved.

51:57.418 --> 52:00.029
You've been upgraded
to a private room.

52:00.029 --> 52:01.466
Let me show you.

52:12.129 --> 52:14.174
But this is Monica's room.

52:14.174 --> 52:15.262
This was
Monica's room.

52:15.262 --> 52:17.264
Now, it's yours.

52:17.264 --> 52:18.744
I don't understand.

52:18.744 --> 52:20.659
Monica loves it here.

52:20.659 --> 52:22.139
Why did she leave?

52:22.139 --> 52:24.750
No one ever truly leaves Lambda
and she'll still be

52:24.750 --> 52:27.318
leading the sosh
committee, but she decided

52:27.318 --> 52:28.797
to get her own
apartment off-campus.

52:28.797 --> 52:30.016
Isn't that a bit sudden?

52:30.016 --> 52:32.018
Hmm,
she's a senior.

52:32.018 --> 52:34.107
Graduation is just around
the corner for her.

52:34.107 --> 52:36.283
She wanted to move on.

52:36.283 --> 52:39.852
To everything there's
a season, right?

52:39.852 --> 52:41.941
By the way, how did your
dinner with Simon

52:41.941 --> 52:43.203
go the other night?

52:43.203 --> 52:44.683
Did he offer you
the summer job?

52:44.683 --> 52:48.382
Oh, um, actually
uh, he had a business call,

52:48.382 --> 52:50.689
so we had to cut
it short, but I've been

52:50.689 --> 52:53.474
thinking I don't wanna
leave my mom home

52:53.474 --> 52:55.563
for the summer, so I'm

52:55.563 --> 52:57.739
I'm just not gonna take
the job.

52:57.739 --> 53:00.438
Cassie,
you're an adult.

53:00.438 --> 53:02.527
You have to think
of your future.

53:02.527 --> 53:03.919
You have to take advantage
of every opportunity

53:03.919 --> 53:05.225
that comes your way.

53:05.225 --> 53:07.488
-Uh, but my mom
-Your mom will understand.

53:07.488 --> 53:09.316
She wants the best for you.

53:09.316 --> 53:11.753
All the opportunities
she never had.

53:11.753 --> 53:13.538
What do you mean?

53:13.538 --> 53:16.323
The travel, salary,
more importantly,

53:16.323 --> 53:17.933
the connections.

53:20.284 --> 53:22.155
Don't let fear of a new world
get in the way

53:22.155 --> 53:23.896
of a good thing.

53:23.896 --> 53:26.725
It's the world
you belong to now.

53:26.725 --> 53:29.336
And you have to admit,
it has its perks.

53:32.513 --> 53:33.949
Yeah,
you're right.

53:33.949 --> 53:35.429
-Of course, you are.
-Wonderful.

53:35.429 --> 53:37.083
I'm sure you'll be
hearing from Simon soon.

53:38.737 --> 53:40.565
Oh, and let me know if you'd
like new flowers

53:40.565 --> 53:42.001
on the patio.

53:42.001 --> 53:44.003
The bougainvillea were
Monica's favorites,

53:44.003 --> 53:45.700
but I think they're hideous.

54:12.858 --> 54:13.685
Stop, stop!

54:25.479 --> 54:27.002
Charlie.

54:27.002 --> 54:28.700
My brain is on fire.

54:28.700 --> 54:29.875
I know.

54:29.875 --> 54:32.094
This chapter
is killing me.

54:32.094 --> 54:33.270
Do you wanna
come meet at the library?

54:33.270 --> 54:34.183
I'm here now.

54:34.183 --> 54:35.837
I can't.

54:35.837 --> 54:37.535
I got so much
going on right now.

54:37.535 --> 54:40.451
There's a sosh committee
meeting in 15 minutes,

54:40.451 --> 54:42.366
I need to be planning
the mas

54:42.366 --> 54:44.063
Uh uh, I'm sorry
I have to go.

54:45.238 --> 54:46.195
What's wrong?

54:46.195 --> 54:47.196
What is it?

54:47.196 --> 54:48.328
It's Sheri.

54:48.328 --> 54:49.808
She's dead.

54:49.808 --> 54:51.766
She was standing on the
corner and she was pushed

54:51.766 --> 54:52.898
right into traffic.

54:52.898 --> 54:55.074
She Sheri's

54:55.074 --> 54:57.032
The cops are saying

54:59.557 --> 55:02.081
They're saying
it's the pusher killer.

55:03.517 --> 55:04.997
We're holding a remembering
ceremony

55:04.997 --> 55:06.564
on campus later today.

55:09.610 --> 55:11.656
Cassie, look!

55:13.092 --> 55:15.355
It was her last picture.

55:15.355 --> 55:17.705
Doesn't she
look beautiful?

55:17.705 --> 55:20.229
When was this taken?

55:20.229 --> 55:22.275
I don't know.

55:22.275 --> 55:24.190
She posted on her
social right before.

55:25.757 --> 55:27.280
Why?

55:31.980 --> 55:33.678
Uh, my jacket?

55:33.678 --> 55:36.463
She was she was wearing
my jacket

55:36.463 --> 55:38.117
when she was pushed.

55:47.518 --> 55:49.650
A loss like this is
difficult

55:52.218 --> 55:55.003
and it's made even more
difficult by the fact that

55:55.003 --> 55:56.744
this is the second time
we've had such pain

55:56.744 --> 55:59.486
at Lambda this year.

55:59.486 --> 56:01.662
I've spoken to the police
and they want me

56:01.662 --> 56:04.056
to reiterate
that while these accidents

56:04.056 --> 56:06.667
are suspicious they've yet
to draw any conclusions.

56:09.148 --> 56:11.542
We will get through this,
but we'll get through it

56:11.542 --> 56:13.848
together, as a family.

57:00.025 --> 57:01.200
No!

57:01.200 --> 57:02.331
What are you doing?

57:20.219 --> 57:21.568
Uh, it's okay.

57:21.568 --> 57:23.352
Cassie, just
had a nightmare.

57:24.397 --> 57:26.051
Why did you scream?

57:26.051 --> 57:27.095
What do you mean?

57:27.095 --> 57:28.270
There was an intruder!

57:28.270 --> 57:30.577
Intruder.

57:33.580 --> 57:35.103
Your door's unlocked.

57:39.456 --> 57:41.632
I locked that door before
I went to bed, I know it.

57:41.632 --> 57:43.547
Okay, so he probably
just used his key.

57:43.547 --> 57:44.722
Key?

57:44.722 --> 57:46.419
why would anyone
have a key to my room?

57:46.419 --> 57:48.247
Because
it's Simon Hughes.

57:48.247 --> 57:49.378
Your angel.

57:49.378 --> 57:51.250
Simon, why?

57:51.250 --> 57:52.599
How?

57:52.599 --> 57:54.775
Come on, you don't
have to pretend with me.

57:54.775 --> 57:57.430
Pretend what?

57:57.430 --> 58:00.215
Look, we're in
the same boat,

58:00.215 --> 58:02.087
although obviously you played
your cards better

58:02.087 --> 58:03.349
than I did.

58:19.974 --> 58:21.454
At the white party,

58:23.238 --> 58:24.979
Wendy introduced me to this
important alum

58:24.979 --> 58:26.764
named Gregory Ashton,

58:26.764 --> 58:29.767
the same way she introduced
you to Simon.

58:29.767 --> 58:31.769
He tried to put his hand
up my dress that night

58:31.769 --> 58:32.987
and I slapped him.

58:32.987 --> 58:35.337
Good for you.

58:35.337 --> 58:37.426
I thought he was just being
drunk and handsy,

58:37.426 --> 58:39.777
but then at the conference
Wendy told me

58:39.777 --> 58:42.693
that if I didn't be sweet

58:42.693 --> 58:43.998
to Greg, she would

58:50.048 --> 58:51.397
She would make sure
my stint in rehab

58:51.397 --> 58:53.834
got known around
campus.

58:53.834 --> 58:55.140
I didn't know.

58:55.140 --> 58:57.490
No one does.

58:57.490 --> 59:00.275
I don't even know
how Wendy found out.

59:00.275 --> 59:01.886
You're not using anymore,
right?

59:01.886 --> 59:04.453
No, I haven't done
anything since then

59:04.453 --> 59:07.718
and I never would, but
it doesn't matter.

59:07.718 --> 59:09.110
I'll still get kicked out
of Lambda because

59:09.110 --> 59:11.112
I lied about that on
my application.

59:11.112 --> 59:12.679
Why?

59:12.679 --> 59:14.507
Why would Wendy do that?

59:14.507 --> 59:17.031
The angel alumni, they aren't
former Lambda girls,

59:18.293 --> 59:21.253
they're Omnicrons.

59:21.253 --> 59:23.385
Rich guys who want pretty
young girl friends who

59:25.300 --> 59:27.564
will do stuff to get clothes,
and tuition, and everything.

59:29.087 --> 59:32.177
This is this is
just so hard to believe.

59:32.177 --> 59:34.266
Listen, I didn't wanna
do it.

59:36.007 --> 59:37.791
I don't even care about
the clothes and stuff anymore,

59:37.791 --> 59:40.925
but You have no idea

59:40.925 --> 59:43.710
how hard I worked
to get in here

59:43.710 --> 59:45.277
and how much I need their help
with room and

59:45.277 --> 59:46.452
board, and everything.

59:46.452 --> 59:49.324
Oh, Lisa,
I'm so sorry.

59:49.324 --> 59:51.588
Look, I believe you.

59:53.546 --> 59:57.855
I've just
I've been so nave.

59:57.855 --> 1:00:00.422
I should have guessed there'd be
more to all of this.

1:00:03.034 --> 1:00:04.992
We have to stop this.

1:00:04.992 --> 1:00:08.213
Stop Wendy,
it's disgusting.

1:00:08.213 --> 1:00:10.215
Okay, but it's not like we can
just go to the cops.

1:00:11.651 --> 1:00:12.696
I mean technically,
what she's doing

1:00:12.696 --> 1:00:14.436
isn't even illegal.

1:00:14.436 --> 1:00:15.829
Rich guys buying pretty
things for their

1:00:15.829 --> 1:00:18.527
-girlfriends is just
-Disgusting.

1:00:18.527 --> 1:00:21.530
The way the world works.

1:00:21.530 --> 1:00:22.401
And anyway, the men aren't
even giving us

1:00:22.401 --> 1:00:24.490
the stuff directly.

1:00:24.490 --> 1:00:25.970
It all comes to
the sorority.

1:00:25.970 --> 1:00:28.102
But there has to be something.

1:00:28.102 --> 1:00:30.757
It's wrong, and
exploitative, and

1:00:31.889 --> 1:00:33.978
unethical.

1:00:33.978 --> 1:00:36.023
We could go to the
ethics council.

1:00:36.023 --> 1:00:37.111
And wind up in
Wendy's crosshairs?

1:00:37.111 --> 1:00:39.418
No, thank you.

1:00:39.418 --> 1:00:41.159
She can't kick you out of Lambda
if she's no longer house mom,

1:00:41.159 --> 1:00:42.987
which is what's gonna happen
the second

1:00:42.987 --> 1:00:44.553
the council hears
about this.

1:00:44.553 --> 1:00:46.686
As a sorority employee,
she falls under

1:00:46.686 --> 1:00:49.384
school oversight.

1:00:49.384 --> 1:00:50.734
Uh, I don't know.

1:00:50.734 --> 1:00:52.997
We have to do this.

1:00:52.997 --> 1:00:55.260
Not just for us but for
everyone

1:00:57.349 --> 1:00:59.786
and for all the girls who
will come after us, please.

1:01:02.484 --> 1:01:05.009
I don't want the other girls
to go through what we did.

1:01:09.187 --> 1:01:10.754
I'm so glad you're
interested in becoming

1:01:10.754 --> 1:01:14.540
one of our angel alumni,
Mr. Anderson.

1:01:14.540 --> 1:01:16.977
If I might ask,
how did you hear about us?

1:01:18.849 --> 1:01:21.503
Yes, Simon Hughes is one
of our biggest supporters.

1:01:24.855 --> 1:01:27.074
Let me send you some
information on our girls.

1:01:27.074 --> 1:01:28.946
I'm sure you'll take
a personal interest.

1:01:28.946 --> 1:01:31.035
Mmhmm, goodbye.

1:01:37.563 --> 1:01:40.000
Okay, everyone.

1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:43.569
Be quiet!

1:01:43.569 --> 1:01:46.093
The masquerade ball
is one week away

1:01:46.093 --> 1:01:48.008
and we still had
so much to do.

1:01:48.008 --> 1:01:49.444
Where's Monica?

1:01:49.444 --> 1:01:51.359
She's the one leading
this committee.

1:01:51.359 --> 1:01:54.493
She's not feeling well.

1:01:56.930 --> 1:02:00.020
I suppose I should just
tell you Monica

1:02:00.020 --> 1:02:01.500
has been suspended
from Lambda.

1:02:01.500 --> 1:02:02.762
Why?

1:02:02.762 --> 1:02:04.721
She just wasn't
meeting her obligations

1:02:04.721 --> 1:02:07.375
after she decided
to move out.

1:02:07.375 --> 1:02:08.942
Perhaps we should bring in
another girl to help

1:02:08.942 --> 1:02:10.422
take up the slack.

1:02:10.422 --> 1:02:12.076
I think Whitney would
be a wonderful fit.

1:02:12.076 --> 1:02:13.642
Uh, but Whitney
is a freshman.

1:02:13.642 --> 1:02:16.384
I thought the committee
was only for upperclassmen.

1:02:18.256 --> 1:02:21.215
As you know,
we make exceptions and

1:02:21.215 --> 1:02:24.001
Whitney, she's very
mature for her age.

1:02:24.001 --> 1:02:25.611
No!

1:02:25.611 --> 1:02:28.222
Uh, we don't need to
rely on a freshman.

1:02:30.094 --> 1:02:33.140
Since Monica's out,
I'll head the committee.

1:02:33.140 --> 1:02:34.663
I'm sure we can get along
with the girls we have,

1:02:34.663 --> 1:02:36.709
right?

1:02:36.709 --> 1:02:39.538
Alright then, done.

1:02:39.538 --> 1:02:40.669
But that means we're
counting on you to create

1:02:40.669 --> 1:02:42.367
a memorable event.

1:02:42.367 --> 1:02:43.368
Can you handle it?

1:02:43.368 --> 1:02:44.804
Absolutely.

1:02:44.804 --> 1:02:47.024
Just give me a minute to
get things figured out and

1:02:47.024 --> 1:02:50.070
we'll meet tomorrow, okay?

1:02:59.863 --> 1:03:01.255
-Hey.
-Hey.

1:03:01.255 --> 1:03:02.996
We're still meeting for coffee
later, right?

1:03:02.996 --> 1:03:04.432
No, I'll be there.

1:03:06.695 --> 1:03:08.872
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
are you okay?

1:03:08.872 --> 1:03:10.438
I feel dizzy.

1:03:10.438 --> 1:03:12.440
Do you just need to get
something to eat?

1:03:13.833 --> 1:03:16.705
Um, no, I think
it's just nerves.

1:03:16.705 --> 1:03:19.143
Don't worry, I'll be okay.

1:03:19.143 --> 1:03:21.798
I just need something
to calm me down.

1:03:23.277 --> 1:03:24.888
You can count on me.

1:03:29.718 --> 1:03:31.764
Uh, Cassie,
just a second.

1:03:31.764 --> 1:03:33.070
I wanted to thank you.

1:03:33.070 --> 1:03:34.898
You really
stepped up today.

1:03:34.898 --> 1:03:37.204
Just trying
to do my part.

1:03:37.204 --> 1:03:38.553
Well, I wish every
girl at Lambda

1:03:38.553 --> 1:03:40.251
had your commitment.

1:03:40.251 --> 1:03:42.514
Uh, now if you have a
minute I'd like to discuss

1:03:42.514 --> 1:03:44.081
some of the specifics
of the gala.

1:03:44.081 --> 1:03:46.257
Oh, uh, actually
I have class and then

1:03:46.257 --> 1:03:48.999
an advisor meeting.

1:03:48.999 --> 1:03:50.739
But I can meet up
later this evening.

1:03:50.739 --> 1:03:52.306
Will that work?

1:03:52.306 --> 1:03:55.048
Sure, I can run some errands
between now and then.

1:03:55.048 --> 1:03:57.094
Just come by my office
when you get back.

1:03:57.094 --> 1:03:59.357
Will do.

1:03:59.357 --> 1:04:01.838
Oh, and did Simon
ever follow up with you?

1:04:03.187 --> 1:04:05.667
Uh, no,
he hasn't called.

1:04:05.667 --> 1:04:07.365
I'm sure he's a very
busy man.

1:04:07.365 --> 1:04:09.149
Hmm.

1:04:09.149 --> 1:04:10.455
I'm sure that's it.

1:04:10.455 --> 1:04:12.370
Okay.

1:04:31.302 --> 1:04:31.955
Cassie Thompson?

1:04:31.955 --> 1:04:33.260
Yes.

1:04:33.260 --> 1:04:34.131
We'll be hearin' your
complain about

1:04:34.131 --> 1:04:35.523
the Kappa Ada Lambda
Sorority next.

1:04:35.523 --> 1:04:36.829
Are you ready?

1:04:36.829 --> 1:04:39.745
Actually um, my friend Lisa
isn't here yet

1:04:39.745 --> 1:04:41.486
uh, but she told me
everything and I can tell

1:04:41.486 --> 1:04:43.575
both you and the council.

1:04:43.575 --> 1:04:45.185
When reporting to
the ethics council,

1:04:45.185 --> 1:04:46.621
you are restricted to
speak about firsthand

1:04:46.621 --> 1:04:47.796
experiences only.

1:04:47.796 --> 1:04:50.408
Hearsay is not permitted.

1:04:50.408 --> 1:04:53.150
Do you wanna proceed with
just your testimony?

1:04:53.150 --> 1:04:55.892
It's just that um,
Lisa was the one

1:04:57.545 --> 1:05:00.200
she had the most to say
and all I can an say is um

1:05:02.028 --> 1:05:03.508
I guess we actually should
just reschedule.

1:05:03.508 --> 1:05:04.465
Yeah.

1:05:04.465 --> 1:05:06.032
Thank you.

1:05:20.525 --> 1:05:22.788
What's going on?

1:05:25.225 --> 1:05:26.618
Lisa overdosed.

1:05:26.618 --> 1:05:28.707
I don't know what happened?

1:05:32.319 --> 1:05:35.192
Cassie,
I'm so sorry.

1:05:35.192 --> 1:05:37.629
Bianca called me back as
soon as the girls found Lisa.

1:05:37.629 --> 1:05:39.936
I told them to call 911,
right away.

1:05:41.502 --> 1:05:43.417
You know, I know Lisa
had been struggling with

1:05:43.417 --> 1:05:45.202
addiction in the past, but
she told me she'd gotten

1:05:45.202 --> 1:05:47.378
clean and I believed her.

1:05:47.378 --> 1:05:49.336
She was.

1:05:49.336 --> 1:05:51.034
But she's been
acting so strange, lately.

1:05:51.034 --> 1:05:54.167
So nervous and agitated.

1:05:54.167 --> 1:05:55.690
Do you have any idea what
could have been

1:05:55.690 --> 1:05:57.257
bothering her?

1:05:57.257 --> 1:05:58.650
No, no idea.

1:05:58.650 --> 1:06:00.826
Just she just
seemed fine.

1:06:00.826 --> 1:06:03.568
Just um, maybe overworked.

1:06:03.568 --> 1:06:05.700
I'll be at the
hospital, but you let me

1:06:05.700 --> 1:06:07.615
know if anything
comes to mind.

1:06:07.615 --> 1:06:09.008
I know her parents will
wanna know anything

1:06:09.008 --> 1:06:10.053
we can tell them.

1:06:21.020 --> 1:06:22.630
Monica.

1:06:22.630 --> 1:06:24.023
Monica, where
have you been?

1:06:24.023 --> 1:06:26.112
Uh, Wendy said that you
I know.

1:06:26.112 --> 1:06:27.548
I know.

1:06:27.548 --> 1:06:29.986
I came to talk to her,
but

1:06:29.986 --> 1:06:34.120
Look, it didn't make sense
to me at first,

1:06:34.120 --> 1:06:37.210
but I think I finally
understand.

1:06:37.210 --> 1:06:39.604
Wendy, she has something
that she's been holding

1:06:39.604 --> 1:06:40.866
over you, right?

1:06:40.866 --> 1:06:42.781
She's been making you do
stuff with the

1:06:42.781 --> 1:06:44.217
other Omni alums, right?

1:06:44.217 --> 1:06:46.567
Wendy hasn't been
making me do anything.

1:06:46.567 --> 1:06:48.961
Okay, I know that's a lie.

1:06:48.961 --> 1:06:50.484
We have to stop her,
we have to go

1:06:50.484 --> 1:06:51.703
to the ethics council.

1:06:51.703 --> 1:06:53.487
I heard you
already tried that.

1:06:53.487 --> 1:06:54.967
What?

1:06:56.229 --> 1:06:59.232
Look at you.

1:06:59.232 --> 1:07:01.104
So young,

1:07:01.104 --> 1:07:02.844
and fresh, and new.

1:07:05.108 --> 1:07:06.718
You should leave Lambda
now before anyone else

1:07:06.718 --> 1:07:09.286
gets hurt.

1:07:09.286 --> 1:07:10.722
You're in over your head.

1:08:12.871 --> 1:08:15.003
Brain still on fire?

1:08:17.441 --> 1:08:20.008
I'm sorry I just need
to calm down.

1:08:20.008 --> 1:08:21.793
Cassie?

1:08:21.793 --> 1:08:23.621
Yeah, um,

1:08:23.621 --> 1:08:25.405
like I don't wanna impose,
but

1:08:25.405 --> 1:08:26.798
can I stay with
you tonight?

1:08:26.798 --> 1:08:27.842
Why?

1:08:27.842 --> 1:08:29.366
What's wrong?

1:08:29.366 --> 1:08:31.672
I can't stay at my place.

1:08:31.672 --> 1:08:33.283
Of course.

1:08:33.283 --> 1:08:35.023
Here, let me text
you my address.

1:08:35.023 --> 1:08:37.243
Uh, I'll explain when
I get there.

1:08:37.243 --> 1:08:38.766
Alright.

1:08:51.388 --> 1:08:52.693
Hi.

1:08:52.693 --> 1:08:55.348
Hi.

1:09:01.876 --> 1:09:06.011
So I know you said nothing
fancy,

1:09:06.011 --> 1:09:07.230
but I went for
Italian and I got a little

1:09:07.230 --> 1:09:08.579
bit of everything.

1:09:11.103 --> 1:09:13.323
-Thanks.
-Mmhmm.

1:09:19.285 --> 1:09:21.113
What is it?

1:09:21.113 --> 1:09:23.942
-You okay?
-Yeah.

1:09:23.942 --> 1:09:26.597
No.

1:09:26.597 --> 1:09:28.816
I really don't know.

1:09:31.079 --> 1:09:33.821
Look, we are friends.

1:09:35.475 --> 1:09:37.260
I wanna help, but maybe
you should tell me

1:09:37.260 --> 1:09:39.653
what's going on.

1:09:39.653 --> 1:09:42.352
Okay.

1:09:42.352 --> 1:09:44.180
Um, this is gonna
sound crazy.

1:10:16.429 --> 1:10:17.604
Mom?

1:10:17.604 --> 1:10:19.519
I didn't wanna wake you.

1:10:19.519 --> 1:10:20.651
Uh, shouldn't you be
at work?

1:10:20.651 --> 1:10:21.695
It's it's Friday.

1:10:21.695 --> 1:10:23.567
It's okay,
I got time off.

1:10:30.051 --> 1:10:32.315
You're all that matters
right now.

1:10:38.364 --> 1:10:40.584
So you called my mother?

1:10:40.584 --> 1:10:42.716
Well, you told me she was
the person you trust most,

1:10:42.716 --> 1:10:45.153
so no-brainer.

1:10:46.503 --> 1:10:48.331
Why didn't you tell me?

1:10:48.331 --> 1:10:50.333
It's disgusting what
that woman is doing.

1:10:50.333 --> 1:10:52.030
I didn't
wanna bother you.

1:10:52.030 --> 1:10:54.380
And I thought I could

1:10:54.380 --> 1:10:55.381
handle it alone.

1:10:55.381 --> 1:10:57.470
You're never alone.

1:10:57.470 --> 1:10:59.124
Don't you know that?

1:11:00.908 --> 1:11:03.694
So how do we stop her?

1:11:03.694 --> 1:11:06.610
Wendy has eyes
and ears everywhere.

1:11:06.610 --> 1:11:08.786
Somehow she knew Lisa and
I were going to the ethics

1:11:08.786 --> 1:11:11.397
council uh, and then
Lisa

1:11:11.397 --> 1:11:13.617
The timing is awfully
suspicious.

1:11:13.617 --> 1:11:15.662
I really don't think
she OD'd.

1:11:15.662 --> 1:11:18.448
I think she was drugged
like

1:11:18.448 --> 1:11:20.493
like I was only maybe
too much.

1:11:20.493 --> 1:11:23.540
I just I can't
prove any of it.

1:11:23.540 --> 1:11:26.064
We have to get her
to admit it.

1:11:26.064 --> 1:11:27.761
It will be my word
against hers and Lambda's

1:11:27.761 --> 1:11:30.329
reputation is spotless.

1:11:30.329 --> 1:11:31.939
What if someone
else heard her?

1:11:31.939 --> 1:11:35.682
I don't know.

1:11:35.682 --> 1:11:38.424
Uh, the ethics council,
I could invite them

1:11:38.424 --> 1:11:40.644
to the masquerade gala.

1:11:40.644 --> 1:11:41.949
And have her admit
it when she didn't know

1:11:41.949 --> 1:11:43.081
they were listening.

1:11:43.081 --> 1:11:45.083
Yeah, if Wendy
and I spoke in my room

1:11:45.083 --> 1:11:46.389
and Iris Jennings was
out on my patio,

1:11:46.389 --> 1:11:49.522
she'd hear everything
we said.

1:11:49.522 --> 1:11:52.133
If you were bartending
the gala, could you get

1:11:52.133 --> 1:11:53.918
the members of the ethics
council on to my patio?

1:11:53.918 --> 1:11:55.398
Just pick a time,
we'll be there.

1:11:55.398 --> 1:11:56.486
Okay.

1:11:56.486 --> 1:11:58.531
Uh, I wanna
be there, too.

1:11:58.531 --> 1:11:59.576
Wendy would
know something was up.

1:11:59.576 --> 1:12:01.708
She already doesn't
like you, mom.

1:12:01.708 --> 1:12:03.884
I'll be wearing
a mask uh, and you need

1:12:03.884 --> 1:12:06.104
someone who can circulate
freely in case you run

1:12:06.104 --> 1:12:07.366
into trouble.

1:12:07.366 --> 1:12:10.108
It's the perfect plan,
but how do we know

1:12:10.108 --> 1:12:12.980
Wendy will confess?

1:12:12.980 --> 1:12:14.547
She will if she
thinks I'm finally willing

1:12:14.547 --> 1:12:16.419
to play ball as far
as Simon's concerned.

1:12:16.419 --> 1:12:17.942
Hmm.

1:12:17.942 --> 1:12:19.683
What about the ethics
council?

1:12:19.683 --> 1:12:21.206
What if they don't believe
you're just playing along?

1:12:21.206 --> 1:12:23.077
They could kick
you out, too.

1:12:23.077 --> 1:12:26.080
That's a chance
I'm willing to take.

1:12:26.080 --> 1:12:27.952
Not just for my sisters, but

1:12:29.736 --> 1:12:31.825
for all the girls who
will come after me.

1:12:41.095 --> 1:12:43.968
Okay, that's everything
for now.

1:12:43.968 --> 1:12:46.057
Um, look I know

1:12:46.057 --> 1:12:48.973
it's difficult,
but this year's gala

1:12:48.973 --> 1:12:51.889
has to be the best one
ever for Lisa and for

1:12:51.889 --> 1:12:53.978
all the sisters who
aren't with us anymore.

1:12:53.978 --> 1:12:54.979
For our sisters.

1:12:54.979 --> 1:12:56.328
For our sisters.

1:12:56.328 --> 1:12:58.025
Yeah, okay.

1:13:13.040 --> 1:13:15.347
Uh, it's just

1:13:15.347 --> 1:13:16.957
I've thought a lot about
what you said

1:13:16.957 --> 1:13:18.829
about making the most of
my opportunities

1:13:20.352 --> 1:13:22.702
and I decided you're right.

1:13:24.487 --> 1:13:27.577
I'm surprised
to hear you say so.

1:13:27.577 --> 1:13:29.709
Frankly, I can't promise
that those opportunities

1:13:29.709 --> 1:13:32.103
are still available to
you, Cassie, not after

1:13:32.103 --> 1:13:33.496
what I heard about
the other night.

1:13:33.496 --> 1:13:35.019
Oh, see the other night?

1:13:35.019 --> 1:13:38.022
I was startled by my visitor.

1:13:38.022 --> 1:13:39.719
He didn't let me know
he planned to stop by

1:13:39.719 --> 1:13:42.418
or else I would have
waited up for him

1:13:42.418 --> 1:13:44.420
and in a prettier
nightie.

1:13:56.519 --> 1:13:57.824
But I'm really looking
forward to seeing Simon

1:13:57.824 --> 1:13:59.696
at the gala.

1:13:59.696 --> 1:14:01.785
It's just something
about a mask.

1:14:03.308 --> 1:14:05.919
The excitement, the mystery,
don't you agree?

1:14:05.919 --> 1:14:07.486
Absolutely.

1:14:07.486 --> 1:14:09.096
It's the best
part of the party.

1:14:09.096 --> 1:14:11.882
The surprise.

1:14:11.882 --> 1:14:14.014
Well, I will make sure
that Simon knows how much

1:14:14.014 --> 1:14:15.538
you are looking
forward to seeing him.

1:14:15.538 --> 1:14:17.104
Thank you.

1:14:49.615 --> 1:14:52.400
I'm so sorry.

1:14:52.400 --> 1:14:55.142
I'm sorry for everything.

1:14:56.274 --> 1:14:58.929
I'm gonna make it right

1:14:58.929 --> 1:15:01.627
for you and
for all the girls.

1:15:07.938 --> 1:15:09.679
-Hey, there.
-Hey.

1:15:09.679 --> 1:15:11.028
You okay?

1:15:11.028 --> 1:15:13.465
I was just
with Lisa again.

1:15:13.465 --> 1:15:15.859
How's she doing?

1:15:15.859 --> 1:15:17.687
You can still
change your mind.

1:15:17.687 --> 1:15:18.905
You know that, right?

1:15:18.905 --> 1:15:20.603
I'm not letting
another girl get hurt.

1:15:20.603 --> 1:15:23.649
This, all of this,

1:15:23.649 --> 1:15:26.086
it ends tonight.

1:15:26.086 --> 1:15:27.348
Let's go.

1:15:42.189 --> 1:15:43.321
So what do you think?

1:15:43.321 --> 1:15:45.279
Looks good.

1:15:45.279 --> 1:15:47.368
Told you we were
the same size.

1:15:54.288 --> 1:15:56.203
Oh.

1:16:05.038 --> 1:16:06.866
Oh, the masks.

1:16:15.701 --> 1:16:17.790
-I like the gold on you.
-Thanks.

1:16:17.790 --> 1:16:19.052
Wendy insisted.

1:16:24.101 --> 1:16:27.321
Cassie,

1:16:27.321 --> 1:16:30.194
if anything goes wrong,
you call me,

1:16:30.194 --> 1:16:31.630
okay?

1:16:31.630 --> 1:16:33.153
-Don't try to be a hero
-I know.

1:16:33.153 --> 1:16:34.938
-Just call.
-I know.

1:16:37.680 --> 1:16:39.812
Remember the plan?

1:16:39.812 --> 1:16:41.074
I love you.

1:16:41.074 --> 1:16:43.381
I love you so much more.

1:16:52.259 --> 1:16:54.218
I did not know that.

1:16:54.218 --> 1:16:56.002
It makes sense with NY.

1:16:56.002 --> 1:16:57.264
Yeah, and

1:17:01.529 --> 1:17:02.661
Hey, Jill.

1:17:02.661 --> 1:17:03.706
Nice to see back.

1:17:03.706 --> 1:17:06.230
You guys enjoy.

1:17:06.230 --> 1:17:07.623
Oh.

1:17:07.623 --> 1:17:09.842
Hi, Miss Jennings,
hello, Mr. Mueller.

1:17:09.842 --> 1:17:12.105
-Thank you both for coming.
-We're happy to be here.

1:17:12.105 --> 1:17:13.237
Uh, follow me.

1:17:13.237 --> 1:17:14.586
I'll show you to the bar.

1:17:32.778 --> 1:17:34.345
No, no problem,
no problem.

1:17:36.782 --> 1:17:37.957
Excuse me.
- Uh.

1:17:37.957 --> 1:17:40.786
-Hi.
-Charlie, this is Iris Jennings

1:17:40.786 --> 1:17:43.006
And Martin Mueller
of ethics council.

1:17:43.006 --> 1:17:44.094
They're very important
guests, so

1:17:44.094 --> 1:17:45.356
Uh-huh.

1:17:45.356 --> 1:17:46.400
Of course.

1:17:46.400 --> 1:17:47.619
See you later.

1:17:47.619 --> 1:17:50.361
See you then.

1:17:50.361 --> 1:17:52.058
What can I get you?

1:17:52.058 --> 1:17:52.624
Champagne?
-Sounds good.

1:17:53.712 --> 1:17:55.366
Excuse me.

1:17:56.584 --> 1:17:58.412
Cassie.

1:17:58.412 --> 1:18:00.588
Wendy told me I'd see
you here in a gold mask.

1:18:01.938 --> 1:18:03.417
You look stunning.

1:18:03.417 --> 1:18:04.418
How are you?

1:18:04.418 --> 1:18:05.855
-Great.
-Yeah?

1:18:05.855 --> 1:18:07.291
-Huh, enjoying the party?
-Very much.

1:18:07.291 --> 1:18:09.423
Hmm.

1:18:09.423 --> 1:18:11.861
I hear we got
our signals crossed.

1:18:11.861 --> 1:18:13.645
Yeah, just a tiny
misunderstanding.

1:18:13.645 --> 1:18:16.387
But you're ready to go now.

1:18:16.387 --> 1:18:18.781
I mean we could always
slip away

1:18:18.781 --> 1:18:20.696
into your room.

1:18:20.696 --> 1:18:22.741
Oh well, I'm playing
hostess, so I can't

1:18:22.741 --> 1:18:24.264
There are plenty of girls
here who could do that.

1:18:24.264 --> 1:18:24.787
Oh, okay.

1:18:24.787 --> 1:18:25.744
-No?
-Whoa!

1:18:25.744 --> 1:18:26.919
-Oh no.
-Hey!

1:18:26.919 --> 1:18:27.964
What the

1:18:27.964 --> 1:18:29.052
Oh, oh let me,

1:18:29.052 --> 1:18:30.009
get you something
for that um

1:18:30.009 --> 1:18:30.967
That's that's alright.

1:18:30.967 --> 1:18:32.533
That's alright, it's okay.

1:18:32.533 --> 1:18:33.839
I'll be back.

1:18:33.839 --> 1:18:35.928
Yeah.

1:18:41.804 --> 1:18:43.283
Thanks.

1:18:43.283 --> 1:18:45.546
10:00 p.m. on the patio.

1:18:55.339 --> 1:18:56.427
It's Monica.

1:18:56.427 --> 1:18:58.342
Invitations?

1:18:58.342 --> 1:19:00.213
Oh, I don't have one.

1:19:00.213 --> 1:19:03.434
Well, look at that.

1:19:03.434 --> 1:19:05.175
You need to ask
her to leave.

1:19:05.175 --> 1:19:06.916
Me?

1:19:06.916 --> 1:19:09.570
There's a job to do
and now you need to do it.

1:19:17.317 --> 1:19:19.798
Monica, you're not supposed
to be here.

1:19:19.798 --> 1:19:21.321
Well,
hello to you, too.

1:19:21.321 --> 1:19:23.976
Look, I need
to ask you to leave.

1:19:23.976 --> 1:19:25.848
Go ahead.

1:19:25.848 --> 1:19:27.110
You've been suspended
from Lambda

1:19:27.110 --> 1:19:28.502
and so you need to leave
or else I'm gonna

1:19:28.502 --> 1:19:30.200
Or else what?

1:19:32.463 --> 1:19:34.508
I have to hand it
to you, little.

1:19:34.508 --> 1:19:36.902
I didn't think you could
do it.

1:19:36.902 --> 1:19:39.035
What?

1:19:39.035 --> 1:19:40.906
Become me.

1:19:44.692 --> 1:19:45.476
Alright, alright,

1:19:45.476 --> 1:19:46.738
I'm going.

1:19:46.738 --> 1:19:48.479
Great party, though.

1:19:48.479 --> 1:19:50.220
Really, just topnotch.

1:19:55.921 --> 1:19:57.227
Uh, right this way.

1:19:57.227 --> 1:19:59.098
Can you follow
me upstairs?

1:19:59.098 --> 1:20:01.187
Great.

1:20:01.187 --> 1:20:03.755
Excuse me,
watch your step.

1:20:03.755 --> 1:20:06.149
'Cause I get all
my stuff from my alumnus.

1:20:06.149 --> 1:20:07.498
I'd love to see it.

1:20:07.498 --> 1:20:10.501
I need to speak with you
in my room.

1:20:10.501 --> 1:20:12.285
Now, is
really not the time.

1:20:12.285 --> 1:20:13.460
We both have other
responsibilities

1:20:13.460 --> 1:20:14.635
at the moment.

1:20:18.814 --> 1:20:21.120
It's regarding my uh,
summer employment.

1:20:24.907 --> 1:20:26.604
Right this way.

1:20:28.649 --> 1:20:30.260
Excuse me, please.

1:20:30.260 --> 1:20:32.305
Excuse me.

1:20:34.830 --> 1:20:36.744
You said someone
wanted to speak with us.

1:20:36.744 --> 1:20:38.790
Yes.

1:20:38.790 --> 1:20:39.791
A student really needs
the guidance

1:20:39.791 --> 1:20:42.141
of the ethics council.

1:20:42.141 --> 1:20:43.795
She asked me to bring you
up here, so that she

1:20:43.795 --> 1:20:45.536
could explain.

1:20:45.536 --> 1:20:47.668
Well, tell her to make an
appointment with the office.

1:20:47.668 --> 1:20:49.235
Wait!

1:20:49.235 --> 1:20:51.237
Please, just give her
another moment, alright?

1:20:51.237 --> 1:20:52.935
This could make all
the difference

1:20:52.935 --> 1:20:55.633
for her and many other
female students.

1:20:56.764 --> 1:20:59.506
Please.

1:21:11.127 --> 1:21:13.129
Now, what
is this all about?

1:21:13.129 --> 1:21:14.608
You've taken cold feet
as far as that excuse is

1:21:14.608 --> 1:21:16.001
gonna go.

1:21:16.001 --> 1:21:18.221
I wanna know what
I'm really bargaining for.

1:21:18.221 --> 1:21:20.484
if I sleep with
Simon Hughes, what do I get?

1:21:22.747 --> 1:21:23.966
What do you want?

1:21:23.966 --> 1:21:26.490
I want money,
an allowance in cash.

1:21:28.361 --> 1:21:29.841
Fine.

1:21:29.841 --> 1:21:32.670
And not just that,
I need help with my classes,

1:21:32.670 --> 1:21:34.454
especially Organic Chemistry,

1:21:34.454 --> 1:21:35.934
I need to get
an A in that class.

1:21:35.934 --> 1:21:38.241
Well, it's nothin'
we haven't done before,

1:21:38.241 --> 1:21:40.156
but you will need to
attend that class, unless

1:21:40.156 --> 1:21:42.854
of course Simon requires
you for something else.

1:21:45.683 --> 1:21:47.511
I'm proud of you, Cassie.

1:21:47.511 --> 1:21:49.643
You're a smart woman.

1:21:49.643 --> 1:21:52.037
Smart women do whatever
it takes to get ahead.

1:21:53.299 --> 1:21:55.040
Yes.

1:21:55.040 --> 1:21:57.390
I believe you're right.

1:21:57.390 --> 1:21:59.392
Hello, Wendy.

1:21:59.392 --> 1:22:00.524
Iris?

1:22:00.524 --> 1:22:01.829
What are you doing out
on the

1:22:01.829 --> 1:22:03.092
Apparently, getting
the full picture

1:22:03.092 --> 1:22:04.354
of the exploitation
and abuses

1:22:04.354 --> 1:22:06.138
that occur at Lambda.

1:22:06.138 --> 1:22:07.400
Well, I don't know
what you heard

1:22:07.400 --> 1:22:08.836
but I can assure you that
there's

1:22:08.836 --> 1:22:10.664
Oh, you don't have to assure
us of anything.

1:22:10.664 --> 1:22:12.579
We heard enough.

1:22:12.579 --> 1:22:15.191
You are suspended
from your position.

1:22:15.191 --> 1:22:16.496
An inquiry will be
conducted and you will be

1:22:16.496 --> 1:22:19.630
prosecuted to the full
extent of the law.

1:22:19.630 --> 1:22:21.414
Wendy, what you have done to
these girls

1:22:21.414 --> 1:22:22.676
Not only that.

1:22:22.676 --> 1:22:24.417
Two girls from Lambda
have died and one

1:22:24.417 --> 1:22:25.723
is still in a coma.

1:22:25.723 --> 1:22:28.552
You can't possibly
think that I had

1:22:28.552 --> 1:22:30.206
I love my girls!

1:22:30.206 --> 1:22:33.078
-I would never
- Get the police.

1:22:33.078 --> 1:22:34.775
Iris, I promise you

1:22:40.390 --> 1:22:42.566
Cassie Thompson, correct?

1:22:42.566 --> 1:22:43.654
You're expelled.

1:22:43.654 --> 1:22:46.048
No,
that's not fair!

1:22:46.048 --> 1:22:47.397
Cassie was just acting
a part, she didn't mean

1:22:47.397 --> 1:22:49.877
anything she said.

1:22:49.877 --> 1:22:51.488
You can't expel her.

1:22:51.488 --> 1:22:53.751
Did you hear what
this young woman said?

1:22:53.751 --> 1:22:55.448
She not only was extorting
money, but she was

1:22:55.448 --> 1:22:58.408
conspiring to cheat
to pass her classes.

1:22:58.408 --> 1:23:00.236
But
-It's okay, Charlie.

1:23:09.636 --> 1:23:11.987
What are you
doing over there?

1:23:11.987 --> 1:23:12.944
Surprise.

1:23:14.990 --> 1:23:16.687
Cassie and I realized
at the last moment

1:23:16.687 --> 1:23:19.559
I'd play the role
with Wendy,

1:23:19.559 --> 1:23:21.257
just in case

1:23:21.257 --> 1:23:23.085
to avoid any
misunderstandings.

1:23:23.085 --> 1:23:25.739
We didn't have
time to give you a heads up.

1:23:25.739 --> 1:23:27.872
Uh, well, I can't expel you.

1:23:27.872 --> 1:23:30.005
No, I'm afraid.

1:23:30.005 --> 1:23:32.442
You're 20 years too late
for that.

1:23:32.442 --> 1:23:34.618
I heard what Wendy said about
you bein' a smart woman.

1:23:35.923 --> 1:23:37.621
I have to agree.

1:23:37.621 --> 1:23:38.578
You thought of everything?

1:23:38.578 --> 1:23:40.754
Not me.

1:23:40.754 --> 1:23:42.539
We.

1:23:42.539 --> 1:23:44.019
My mom, and Charlie,
and I.

1:23:44.019 --> 1:23:46.847
Thank you, all of you.

1:24:00.209 --> 1:24:01.993
I can't believe
you and your mom.

1:24:03.125 --> 1:24:04.909
That was awesome.

1:24:07.390 --> 1:24:09.827
You okay?

1:24:09.827 --> 1:24:11.524
Yeah.

1:24:14.614 --> 1:24:16.355
Thank you.

1:24:16.355 --> 1:24:18.183
Mmhmm.

1:24:21.665 --> 1:24:23.493
I love you.

1:24:23.493 --> 1:24:25.973
You know that?

1:24:25.973 --> 1:24:27.758
I love you, too.

1:24:34.504 --> 1:24:36.375
Do you really think Wendy was
behind those deaths?

1:24:38.464 --> 1:24:42.164
I can't prove it, but hopefully
the police will.

1:24:42.164 --> 1:24:44.688
It's just too convenient for it
to have not been her.

1:24:46.385 --> 1:24:49.171
Yeah, but I think
the library uh,

1:24:49.171 --> 1:24:52.261
and the attack
in the bathroom,

1:24:52.261 --> 1:24:54.524
it doesn't make sense for Wendy
to try to hurt you

1:24:54.524 --> 1:24:56.134
when there was so much writing
on you agreeing

1:24:56.134 --> 1:24:57.222
to sleep with Simon.

1:24:57.222 --> 1:25:00.312
Yeah, but who would do
that to me?

1:25:00.312 --> 1:25:02.140
I mean do you think it
could have been a prank?

1:25:02.140 --> 1:25:03.359
No way.

1:25:03.359 --> 1:25:05.578
And what about Lisa?

1:25:05.578 --> 1:25:08.407
You told me Wendy wasn't
there when she got hurt.

1:25:16.459 --> 1:25:17.721
Well, I'm sure the police
will get

1:25:17.721 --> 1:25:19.505
to the bottom of everything.

1:25:20.941 --> 1:25:22.987
I don't wanna think
about it anymore.

1:25:24.858 --> 1:25:26.382
Yeah, I'm sure you're right.

1:25:26.382 --> 1:25:27.644
Hmm.

1:25:27.644 --> 1:25:29.950
Besides, I can
think of much better

1:25:29.950 --> 1:25:31.822
things to think about.

1:25:31.822 --> 1:25:33.693
Oh, yeah?

1:25:33.693 --> 1:25:35.434
Like what?

1:25:35.434 --> 1:25:37.436
Like you and me finally being
able to go on a date.

1:25:39.046 --> 1:25:41.571
Not a coffee date,
not a study date, a real date.

1:25:44.226 --> 1:25:46.793
It does seem to be a much better
thing to think about.

1:25:57.761 --> 1:25:59.154
Charlie!

1:26:02.069 --> 1:26:04.246
You.

1:26:04.246 --> 1:26:06.422
Hello, little.

1:26:08.163 --> 1:26:09.381
What are you doing?

1:26:09.381 --> 1:26:12.515
I don't but I don't unders

1:26:12.515 --> 1:26:14.125
It was it was you
in the bathroom.

1:26:14.125 --> 1:26:15.213
You tried to drown me.

1:26:15.213 --> 1:26:17.694
I said you were in
over your head,

1:26:17.694 --> 1:26:19.826
but you don't listen.

1:26:26.311 --> 1:26:28.313
Yeah, okay, okay,
okay, you listen, listen.

1:26:28.313 --> 1:26:30.272
Wendy can't make
you do this, okay?

1:26:30.272 --> 1:26:31.229
They they've
arrested her.

1:26:31.229 --> 1:26:33.797
She's been she's
been taken to jail.

1:26:33.797 --> 1:26:36.669
You don't know, do you?

1:26:36.669 --> 1:26:39.150
This isn't about Wendy

1:26:39.150 --> 1:26:40.630
or the sosh committee.

1:26:41.631 --> 1:26:44.634
This is about him.

1:26:44.634 --> 1:26:46.201
Him?

1:26:46.201 --> 1:26:47.289
Simon, you idiot!

1:26:47.289 --> 1:26:48.725
Wait, what?

1:26:50.683 --> 1:26:52.207
We were gonna get
married.

1:26:53.556 --> 1:26:55.993
He was gonna leave
his wife for me.

1:26:57.342 --> 1:27:00.258
And then, he saw you.

1:27:00.258 --> 1:27:01.999
Oh, Monica,
please, please.

1:27:01.999 --> 1:27:03.479
And everything changed.

1:27:03.479 --> 1:27:04.958
Monica, listen.

1:27:04.958 --> 1:27:07.483
There is nothing going
on between me and Simon,

1:27:07.483 --> 1:27:08.658
okay?

1:27:08.658 --> 1:27:10.094
Oh please, I was there
that night!

1:27:10.094 --> 1:27:10.877
You were falling
all over him!

1:27:10.877 --> 1:27:11.661
What?

1:27:11.661 --> 1:27:12.923
No, I had been roofied!

1:27:12.923 --> 1:27:14.664
I wasn't coming on to him!

1:27:15.969 --> 1:27:17.319
I suppose Wendy
wanted to keep his money

1:27:17.319 --> 1:27:18.407
in the house.

1:27:29.679 --> 1:27:31.724
Look, okay, wait a minute.

1:27:31.724 --> 1:27:32.769
Stop.

1:27:32.769 --> 1:27:34.161
Okay, you don't
need to do this.

1:27:34.161 --> 1:27:35.293
Okay, you're not a killer.

1:27:38.165 --> 1:27:40.733
No, see, that's where you're
wrong, little.

1:27:42.909 --> 1:27:45.303
When they asked me to take
care of Kerrie to stop her

1:27:45.303 --> 1:27:47.566
from exposing the sosh
committee

1:27:49.394 --> 1:27:52.658
But after I pushed her,

1:27:52.658 --> 1:27:55.574
I realized that killing that
looks hard,

1:27:55.574 --> 1:27:57.750
but it's actually
very easy.

1:27:59.404 --> 1:28:01.580
First, it was Carrie, and
then Sherri, though,

1:28:01.580 --> 1:28:04.366
I thought she was you,

1:28:04.366 --> 1:28:06.455
and then Lisa,
and now you.

1:28:08.631 --> 1:28:09.980
You'll die as
the rest of all.

1:28:33.264 --> 1:28:34.700
Cassie, open the door.

1:28:42.360 --> 1:28:43.883
Good bye,
little sister.

1:28:47.017 --> 1:28:48.410
No!

1:29:07.733 --> 1:29:10.214
The issues that surround
exploitation are complex

1:29:11.868 --> 1:29:13.870
and while this
work is challenging,

1:29:13.870 --> 1:29:16.655
new victories are being
made every day.

1:29:16.655 --> 1:29:19.571
Little by little and
working together

1:29:19.571 --> 1:29:22.487
as a sisterhood,
we can make a real difference,

1:29:22.487 --> 1:29:25.272
not only on campus but
throughout the country.

1:29:25.272 --> 1:29:26.926
Thank you.

1:29:28.450 --> 1:29:30.103
Good job, Cass.

1:29:30.103 --> 1:29:32.715
Oh, and thanks
to our house mom

1:29:32.715 --> 1:29:35.413
My real mom Debra
and my Lambda sister Lisa

1:29:35.413 --> 1:29:36.458
for organizing this event.

1:29:39.765 --> 1:29:41.332
Great job.

1:29:41.332 --> 1:29:42.855
We got done just in time,
he'll be here any second.

1:29:42.855 --> 1:29:45.162
Have fun, okay?

1:29:45.162 --> 1:29:45.989
-Be careful.
-Okay.

1:29:45.989 --> 1:29:48.208
I love you.

1:29:48.208 --> 1:29:49.122
-Love you more.
- Oh.

1:29:49.122 --> 1:29:52.256
Bye.

1:29:52.256 --> 1:29:53.039
Hi, guys.

1:30:04.311 --> 1:30:07.358
Sorry, I'm late.

1:30:07.358 --> 1:30:10.535
-You look amazing.
-Thank you.

1:30:10.535 --> 1:30:13.059
Um, so where are we going
on our first real date?

1:30:14.670 --> 1:30:17.586
How do you feel about tapas?

1:30:17.586 --> 1:30:18.848
You know, the finger food?

1:30:18.848 --> 1:30:21.459
Sounds great,
but why finger food?

1:30:21.459 --> 1:30:22.547
No knives.

1:30:24.723 --> 1:30:25.898
Are you okay to drive?

1:30:25.898 --> 1:30:28.640
Oh, I mean yeah.

1:30:28.640 --> 1:30:29.902
I made it here okay.

1:30:29.902 --> 1:30:31.251
Maybe I should.
