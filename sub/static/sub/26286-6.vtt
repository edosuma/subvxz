WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:02.736
Previously on This Is Us...

00:02.770 --> 00:05.306
I'm Randall Pearson,
and I'm running for councilman

00:05.339 --> 00:06.540
for the 12th District.

00:06.574 --> 00:08.376
You are not from here, honey.

00:08.409 --> 00:10.078
MAN:
Go home.

00:10.111 --> 00:11.745
Beth, there is no easy way
to say this.

00:11.779 --> 00:13.847
We have to let you go.

00:13.881 --> 00:15.849
It worked, baby.

00:15.883 --> 00:16.884
I'm pregnant.

00:19.887 --> 00:21.855
ROBINSON: The Jack I knew
wanted everything

00:21.889 --> 00:24.258
from that war behind him.

00:24.292 --> 00:26.827
But who's to say
he wouldn't have wanted you

00:26.860 --> 00:28.896
to know his story?

00:34.735 --> 00:36.537
Hmm.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.408
-Hi, sweetheart.
: Hey, Mom.

00:40.441 --> 00:43.010
The IVF worked.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.512
I'm pregnant.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.580
:
What?

00:48.882 --> 00:51.085
I can't believe it!

00:51.119 --> 00:53.621
My sister's having a baby. Beth!

00:53.654 --> 00:55.055
Get in here. It's Kate!

00:55.089 --> 00:57.558
We're getting another Pearson...

00:57.591 --> 00:59.026
Hell yeah.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.694
-You guys deserve this.
-Yo!

01:00.728 --> 01:02.530
-Oh, my...
-Wait, put my man Tobias
on the phone.

01:02.563 --> 01:03.931
I want to congratulate him, too.

01:05.133 --> 01:07.034
Toby is actually...

01:07.067 --> 01:09.637
Depressed

01:09.670 --> 01:12.240
No, not about the baby.
He's thrilled about the baby.

01:12.273 --> 01:14.742
Apparently, he went off
his antidepressants

01:14.775 --> 01:18.146
in case the IVF didn't work and
they had to conceive naturally.

01:18.179 --> 01:19.747
Why doesn't he just
get back on them?

01:19.780 --> 01:22.950
He did. He's been back on them
for two weeks now.

01:22.983 --> 01:24.718
It's just taking time
for them to kick back in.

01:24.752 --> 01:26.754
So how's Kate doing
through it all?

01:26.787 --> 01:28.156
She's hanging in there.

01:28.189 --> 01:30.991
I just wish
she wasn't so far away.

01:32.326 --> 01:33.794
Do you want me
to come out there?

01:33.827 --> 01:37.998
Oh, that's really sweet,
Kev, but...

01:38.031 --> 01:39.733
there's not really anything
you can do.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.769
Is Toby feeling any better?

01:50.778 --> 01:54.081
Hi, honey.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.449
How are you feeling?

01:55.483 --> 01:57.185
Oh, just tired.

01:57.218 --> 02:00.521
I was, uh, gonna take Audio
on a walk.

02:00.554 --> 02:03.424
Dr. Jasper said I should keep up
with the light exercise,

02:03.457 --> 02:05.359
so maybe we could
all go together.

02:05.393 --> 02:06.794
If you're feeling up for it?

02:06.827 --> 02:09.330
Know what? You guys go ahead.

02:09.363 --> 02:11.699
There you go, buddy.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.643
*

02:29.850 --> 02:30.884
-KEVIN: Yes!
-RANDALL: No, no, no.

02:30.918 --> 02:32.152
-Yes!
-Come on, come on.

02:32.186 --> 02:33.687
-Yes! Yes!
-Come on. Oh!

02:33.721 --> 02:35.122
Touchdown!

02:35.155 --> 02:37.124
That's five in a row for me,
you suckable sucker.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.526
-How does it feel

02:38.559 --> 02:40.628
-Mom!

02:40.661 --> 02:42.129
-Mom!

02:42.162 --> 02:44.232
-Kevin, get off of me!
-No!

02:44.265 --> 02:47.201
Kevin, MVP of the world!

02:47.235 --> 02:48.636
Kevin, get off your brother.
Come on.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.404
Come on, Mom.
We're just messing around.

02:50.438 --> 02:51.705
RANDALL:
Oh, you're so annoying.

02:51.739 --> 02:54.208
-REBECCA: Hey.
-Hey. Hey, Pearsons.

02:54.242 --> 02:56.410
-Hey.
-Hey, Dad.
-Hey, Dad.

02:56.444 --> 02:58.246
What's with the, uh,
baseball hat?

02:58.279 --> 03:01.849
Oh, you know, just, uh,
little hometown pride.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.586
-You have a black eye.
-Yeah.

03:05.619 --> 03:08.055
-I was boxing
one of the guys at the gym

03:08.088 --> 03:10.424
and just caught a nasty punch.
I'm fine.

03:10.458 --> 03:12.192
-REBECCA: Um...

03:12.226 --> 03:13.727
Go set the table, please?

03:13.761 --> 03:15.729
-Go. Go, go, go, go, go.
Come on.
-Come on.

03:17.465 --> 03:20.834
Jack, I knew you were using
the punching bag at the gym,

03:20.868 --> 03:23.904
but since when did you start
boxing actual human beings?

03:23.937 --> 03:26.206
I don't do it that often,
just every once in a while,

03:26.240 --> 03:30.177
me and some guys at the gym,
we... spar a little bit.

03:30.210 --> 03:33.347
-It's no big deal.
-Yeah, says my husband
with the black eye.

03:33.381 --> 03:35.716
You know, boxers
can get brain damage.

03:35.749 --> 03:38.286
The guy that gave me this, that
tagged me, his name's Stuart.

03:38.319 --> 03:41.088
Okay? Guys named Stuart
don't give you brain damage.

03:41.121 --> 03:43.123
It's dangerous, babe.

03:43.156 --> 03:46.594
Promise me, punching bag only.

03:49.497 --> 03:51.965
I promise.

03:51.999 --> 03:54.067
Thank you.

03:54.101 --> 03:56.203
Yeah.

03:56.236 --> 03:59.607
Hi. This is Beth Pearson,
calling for Kellie.

03:59.640 --> 04:04.978
I was checking to see
if you got the résumé I sent in.

04:05.012 --> 04:07.581
You had asked me
to send it last week,

04:07.615 --> 04:11.952
but I hadn't heard anything,
so I thought I'd call.

04:11.985 --> 04:13.787
Uh, which is obvious,

04:13.821 --> 04:16.624
because you're getting
a voice-mail message from me.

04:16.657 --> 04:22.262
So if you could, uh, call me
back, that would be super-duper.

04:22.296 --> 04:24.131
:
God...

04:24.164 --> 04:27.468
RANDALL: Babe?
I need help picking a shirt.

04:27.501 --> 04:30.571
-White.
-Blue.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.740
All right, so it's a draw
between Paul and John.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.642
-Ringo.

04:34.675 --> 04:35.909
The hell I'm Ringo.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.578
What happened to the teal?

04:37.611 --> 04:39.947
I thought teal... I don't know,
I was a little concerned

04:39.980 --> 04:41.982
it might make too much
of a statement for church.

04:42.015 --> 04:43.016
It's never too much
of a statement

04:43.050 --> 04:44.452
for black church, Randall.

04:44.485 --> 04:45.919
:
Black church.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.588
Why are you going to church
in Philadelphia?

04:47.621 --> 04:49.189
Well, 'cause I'm running
for office in Philly,

04:49.222 --> 04:50.758
so I got to get my Philly on.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.626
Really connect with the people
in the community

04:52.660 --> 04:54.027
that I want to represent.

04:54.061 --> 04:55.696
Maybe after church, I will

04:55.729 --> 04:58.265
treat myself to an authentic
Philly cheesesteak.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.334
Load it up with Cheez Whiz
and everything.

05:00.368 --> 05:02.302
Cheez Whiz is gross.

05:02.336 --> 05:05.138
My beautiful darling gem
of a daughter,

05:05.172 --> 05:07.475
if you ever say that within
Philadelphia city limits,

05:07.508 --> 05:09.276
I will be forced to disown you.

05:09.309 --> 05:12.012
Guys, can we talk about us now?

05:12.045 --> 05:13.447
-Okay.
-RANDALL: Sure, yeah.

05:13.481 --> 05:16.350
We're way behind
on Girl Scout cookie sales.

05:16.384 --> 05:20.320
Usually, we go to Mom's office
and sell at least 150 there,

05:20.354 --> 05:21.989
but, uh...

05:23.657 --> 05:25.726
Hey, um, how about tomorrow,

05:25.759 --> 05:27.861
when I have a little bit
more free time...

05:27.895 --> 05:29.863
No. It's fine.

05:29.897 --> 05:32.065
You have stuff to do. I don't.

05:32.099 --> 05:34.968
Uh, you know, we can set up
a table today to sell them.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.971
Right? We-we could
make some posters.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.840
Why don't you guys go ask Deja
if she wants to join us?

05:43.444 --> 05:45.913
It's gonna be great.

05:47.180 --> 05:50.317
Great.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.319
Oh, Toby's still
not feeling any better?

05:52.352 --> 05:54.755
KATE :
No. Not really.

05:54.788 --> 05:58.325
But I don't know if I should be
pushing him to get out of bed,

05:58.358 --> 06:02.095
or if I should just...
let him take his time.

06:02.129 --> 06:03.897
I mean, what would you do?

06:03.931 --> 06:08.502
Uh, I think all you can do is
just be patient and supportive.

06:08.536 --> 06:11.104
But you need to be taking care
of yourself, too, Bug.

06:11.138 --> 06:12.706
-Yeah, I know.

06:12.740 --> 06:15.909
I mean, I'm really
trying hard to stay chill.

06:15.943 --> 06:18.579
Audio! Mom, I got to go.
I got to go.

06:18.612 --> 06:22.182
Audio. My God. Hey.
Hey, hey, let me see.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.384
What did you eat? What's in
your mouth? What did you...

06:24.418 --> 06:26.153
That doesn't look like food.

06:29.757 --> 06:31.892
I really wish I knew
what her name was, you know?

06:31.925 --> 06:33.894
Or anything about her, really.

06:33.927 --> 06:36.129
I mean, she's wearing
my dad's necklace.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.299
You listening to me?

06:39.332 --> 06:41.301
Finito, completo.

06:41.334 --> 06:44.204
-My documentary is done.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.373
All that's left now is to not
obsessively check my e-mail

06:46.406 --> 06:48.141
while I wait to hear back
from the festivals.

06:48.175 --> 06:49.643
Are you kidding me?
Everyone's gonna want it.

06:49.677 --> 06:51.645
Look at you: you got indie
darling written all over you.

06:51.679 --> 06:53.581
This is great news.
Ooh, you know what we got to do?

06:53.614 --> 06:54.615
-We got to celebrate.

06:54.648 --> 06:56.216
I've got an in at Le Bernardin.

06:56.249 --> 06:59.152
Just got to text Kimmel
real quick-- as in Jimmy Kimmel.

06:59.186 --> 07:02.490
-Jimmy Kimmel, he's my in.
-Um, well, that's really sweet,

07:02.523 --> 07:04.091
but actually,
I have this tradition,

07:04.124 --> 07:06.594
that every time I finish
a project, I check into a hotel

07:06.627 --> 07:08.095
for a night of pampering.

07:08.128 --> 07:10.498
Get room service,
spend so long in a hot tub

07:10.531 --> 07:12.399
I turn into a full-on
human raisin.

07:12.432 --> 07:13.634
-Yeah.

07:13.667 --> 07:14.935
I'm in. Let's do it.

07:14.968 --> 07:16.637
-Uh...
-Oh, gosh.

07:16.670 --> 07:19.306
Um, how do I explain?

07:19.339 --> 07:21.241
I'm going alone.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.275
You're going alone?

07:22.309 --> 07:23.577
-Yes.

07:23.611 --> 07:25.979
This tradition
is about decompressing.

07:26.013 --> 07:28.181
I can't have your obsession
with that photo raining all over

07:28.215 --> 07:29.617
my 800-thread-count sheet
parade.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.919
And, uh, seriously,

07:31.952 --> 07:34.154
stop thinking about the photo.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.296
Hey, Dad.

07:43.330 --> 07:46.033
I need you to teach me to box.

07:46.066 --> 07:48.268
Randall, you heard your mother.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.237
There's no boxing in this house.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.106
Dad, there's this kid at school.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.875
-Uh-huh.
-His name's Dylan.

07:54.908 --> 07:57.545
He just moved here from New
York, and he's picking on me.

07:57.578 --> 07:59.312
What?

07:59.346 --> 08:01.849
He pushes me into lockers
every time he gets a chance.

08:01.882 --> 08:03.216
Look, we got
to tell your mother,

08:03.250 --> 08:04.552
and then we're gonna
call your school.

08:04.585 --> 08:06.353
We'll-we'll get it
taken care of.

08:06.386 --> 08:09.222
Dad, everybody's gonna make fun
of me for being a snitch.

08:11.324 --> 08:14.194
I won't defend myself
unless I really have to.

08:14.227 --> 08:17.064
It'll just make me feel better
to know I can.

08:18.932 --> 08:21.134
* He's got, he's got the whole

08:21.168 --> 08:23.804
* He's got the whole world
in his hands *

08:23.837 --> 08:25.873
-* He's got the whole
-* He's got the whole world

08:25.906 --> 08:27.307
-* In his hands
-* Oh, he's got the whole

08:27.340 --> 08:30.744
* He's got the whole world
in his hands *

08:30.778 --> 08:34.715
* Whole world in his hands.

08:34.748 --> 08:37.484
-Somebody say amen.
-CONGREGATION: Amen.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.352
Welcome, friends,
on this beautiful day

08:39.386 --> 08:41.154
that God has given us.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.723
-Yes.
-You may be seated.

08:45.292 --> 08:48.829
Our brother Solomon is going
to read from scripture.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.431
-Brother Solomon.

08:51.464 --> 08:53.066
SOLOMON:
Thank you, Rev.

08:54.768 --> 08:56.670
Blessed day,
my brothers and sisters.

08:57.905 --> 09:00.507
Before I share this good word,

09:00.540 --> 09:04.177
I want to make sure we give
a warm welcome to my friend

09:04.211 --> 09:05.579
and first-time visitor...

09:05.613 --> 09:07.080
:
Oh, God, please don't.

09:07.114 --> 09:08.448
Randall Pearson.

09:08.481 --> 09:12.552
Stand up so we can
greet you, brother.

09:13.787 --> 09:16.423
Randall is visiting us

09:16.456 --> 09:19.426
all the way
from Alpine, New Jersey.

09:19.459 --> 09:21.194
Uh...

09:21.228 --> 09:23.096
Praise the Lord, everyone.

09:23.130 --> 09:24.932
-CONGREGATION: Praise the Lord.

09:24.965 --> 09:29.970
Um, my family and I own
a building on Olney and Third.

09:30.003 --> 09:31.571
It's just a couple blocks away.

09:31.605 --> 09:33.941
So actually, we're very local.

09:33.974 --> 09:35.643
Well, why don't you have
that beautiful family of yours

09:35.676 --> 09:37.477
stand up, too?

09:37.510 --> 09:40.313
Well, unfortunately, they
weren't able to be here today.

09:40.347 --> 09:42.816
Oh. Maybe next time.

09:42.850 --> 09:44.551
You know, Randall is the one

09:44.584 --> 09:46.787
running against me
for city council.

09:46.820 --> 09:49.890
Now, you might think I wouldn't
welcome him here as a friend,

09:49.923 --> 09:53.493
but, well, he's trying
to do something good.

09:53.526 --> 09:55.495
He cares about people.

09:55.528 --> 09:58.398
And there's nothing
wrong with that.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.734
So, Randall,

10:00.768 --> 10:04.104
we welcome you
to our humble neighborhood.

10:05.538 --> 10:07.641
Thank you, my friend.

10:07.675 --> 10:10.343
And thank you all for having me.

10:10.377 --> 10:13.080
SOLOMON: And now, I'll be
reading from the Book of Job,

10:13.113 --> 10:15.115
chapter 42.

10:16.650 --> 10:18.618
You're dragging my poster, Mom.

10:18.652 --> 10:21.188
-I'm sorry.

10:21.221 --> 10:23.423
Well, because the parking lot
was full.

10:23.456 --> 10:26.159
Which is great news for
you guys, because busy store

10:26.193 --> 10:27.861
means lots of customers.

10:27.895 --> 10:30.263
Oh, man.

10:30.297 --> 10:33.066
I-I told you we should've
come earlier.

10:36.003 --> 10:39.106
Uh, you know what?
It's okay.

10:39.139 --> 10:43.844
We'll just go somewhere else.
Right

10:43.877 --> 10:45.879
Okay, come on.
Oh...

10:53.821 --> 10:55.022
Hey, Kev.

10:55.055 --> 10:57.657
Hey, uh, listen,
you got some time?

10:57.691 --> 10:59.559
I need to talk to you
about something.

10:59.592 --> 11:02.062
Actually, I'm in Philly
doing campaign stuff all day.

11:02.095 --> 11:04.965
-I can come to Philly.
-Please, do not come to Philly.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.900
Last thing I need is my white,
movie star brother

11:06.934 --> 11:08.568
coming and destroying
what's left of my

11:08.601 --> 11:10.537
already precious-little
street cred.

11:10.570 --> 11:12.172
Okay, listen, man,
here's the thing.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.841
I know where
your office is, okay,

11:13.874 --> 11:16.543
and you know that I don't
respect boundaries, so...

11:16.576 --> 11:19.079
I will... I'll text you
the address of a place

11:19.112 --> 11:20.547
where we can meet.

11:20.580 --> 11:21.915
KEVIN :
Cool. It's a date.

11:23.616 --> 11:26.086
Okay, bud, look.

11:26.119 --> 11:30.590
I made bacon, all rubbery,
just like you like it.

11:30.623 --> 11:34.094
Oh, hi. What's up?
How are you?

11:34.127 --> 11:37.530
I'm fine.
What's wrong with Audio?

11:37.564 --> 11:38.766
-Audio...

11:40.233 --> 11:42.235
Wait, is he...
is he not eating his bacon?

11:42.269 --> 11:44.004
Okay, please don't freak out.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.373
He may have swallowed
something bad at the dog park.

11:46.406 --> 11:49.209
-I was on the phone.

11:49.242 --> 11:50.443
I shouldn't have been
on the phone.

11:50.477 --> 11:52.545
-I will call the vet right now.

11:52.579 --> 11:56.283
-I'm sorry.

11:57.650 --> 11:59.286
I didn't mean
to make you feel bad.

12:05.258 --> 12:07.460
-One. One-two. All right.
-One-two.

12:07.494 --> 12:10.730
You know, you got a lot of power
coming out of that left.

12:10.764 --> 12:13.466
You know what, try... sw-switch
up your feet so your...

12:13.500 --> 12:15.769
so your right foot is forward.
Okay? There you go.

12:15.803 --> 12:16.937
Just like that.
Same thing, okay?

12:16.970 --> 12:19.272
One-two. Jab, cross.

12:19.306 --> 12:23.143
-Jab, cross. Jab, cross.
-One more. Jab, cross.

12:23.176 --> 12:24.744
-That feels good.

12:24.778 --> 12:27.815
Ladies and gents, we've got
a southpaw fighter on our hands.

12:27.848 --> 12:28.816
I'm a southpaw.

12:28.849 --> 12:30.050
-You're a southpaw.
-I'm a southpaw.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.452
All right, let's get
that southpaw in fighting shape.

12:32.485 --> 12:35.122
-Ready. One-two.
-Guys, I'm home.

12:43.696 --> 12:45.465
Hi.

12:45.498 --> 12:47.067
How are you?
It's me.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.002
How you doing?
Enjoy yourself.

12:49.036 --> 12:50.971
-Hey, man.
-Hey.

12:51.004 --> 12:52.339
-Ah.

12:52.372 --> 12:53.673
This is where I bring
my famous siblings

12:53.706 --> 12:54.808
I can't be seen with.

12:54.842 --> 12:57.177
KEVIN:
Ah.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.646
RANDALL:
Wow.

12:59.679 --> 13:01.849
This is all...

13:01.882 --> 13:03.650
-a lot.
-Yeah.

13:03.683 --> 13:05.485
I mean, look at that.

13:05.518 --> 13:07.787
Dad's obviously in love
with that woman, right?

13:07.821 --> 13:09.156
I don't know.

13:09.189 --> 13:12.192
I can't read her face.
Is it love,

13:12.225 --> 13:14.161
or is it years of poverty

13:14.194 --> 13:16.029
and occupation
by foreign governments?

13:16.063 --> 13:18.465
He gave me her necklace, right?

13:18.498 --> 13:19.732
That means something.

13:24.737 --> 13:27.640
Why now?

13:27.674 --> 13:29.009
All of this.

13:31.378 --> 13:35.148
I don't...
Do you remember, um...

13:35.182 --> 13:37.484
I don't know, we were,
like, maybe five years old.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.987
There was that-that guest room
that had the wallpaper

13:40.020 --> 13:41.955
with the little blue ships
on it; you remember that?

13:41.989 --> 13:43.123
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah, okay.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.824
So, you and I were playing
in there one day,

13:44.858 --> 13:47.794
and we discovered this
little spot on the wallpaper

13:47.827 --> 13:49.963
behind the sofa
that was peeling, right?

13:49.997 --> 13:52.866
And-and so you and I, we sort of
peeled it a little more.

13:52.900 --> 13:55.568
And then we kept peeling
just because we could.

13:55.602 --> 13:57.004
And the next thing you know,
we had, like,

13:57.037 --> 13:58.505
half of the wallpaper
was off the wall.

13:58.538 --> 13:59.506
Do you remember that?

13:59.539 --> 14:01.875
I remember getting
a particularly stern

14:01.909 --> 14:03.843
-talking-to from Mom about that.
-Yes.

14:03.877 --> 14:06.046
It-it just blew our little minds

14:06.079 --> 14:09.182
that there was wood paneling
behind the wallpaper.

14:09.216 --> 14:11.251
Like, it had never
occurred to us

14:11.284 --> 14:13.921
that there was anything
beneath those ships.

14:18.959 --> 14:20.627
I started peeling.

14:23.931 --> 14:25.966
I'm curious about Dad, too.

14:28.301 --> 14:31.204
But Vietnam...

14:31.238 --> 14:33.773
that was a chapter in his life
he didn't want us to know about.

14:33.806 --> 14:36.609
He made that very clear
while he was still alive.

14:36.643 --> 14:38.245
I know.

14:41.614 --> 14:43.250
Yeah, you know,
maybe you're right.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.018
You know, between the V.A.
and Robinson,

14:45.052 --> 14:46.786
no one has
any answers anyway, so...

14:48.155 --> 14:50.457
Uh, sorry, man,
we haven't ordered yet.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.792
Oh.
It's on the house.

14:54.327 --> 14:56.063
-Kamsahamnida.
-Oh.

14:59.599 --> 15:00.767
You know what that is?

15:00.800 --> 15:03.370
-No idea.
-The Manny.

15:03.403 --> 15:04.804
Number-one show in South Korea.

15:04.837 --> 15:06.206
-I kid you not.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.241
I think I got a K-pop song
named after me.

15:08.275 --> 15:11.278
I'm telling you, that's how
you know you've made it.

15:11.311 --> 15:12.812
Big deal.

15:12.845 --> 15:16.783
Hey, you're free
for the rest of the day, right?

15:16.816 --> 15:18.485
Wow, look at this, man.

15:18.518 --> 15:20.387
You got color-coded maps
and everything up in here,

15:20.420 --> 15:21.721
just like CNN.

15:21.754 --> 15:22.755
This is legit.

15:22.789 --> 15:23.923
In the last municipal election

15:23.957 --> 15:25.892
held in this district, only 25%

15:25.925 --> 15:27.494
of registered voters voted.

15:27.527 --> 15:31.264
-95% of those voted for Brown.

15:32.765 --> 15:35.235
About 50% of the Korean
population in this district

15:35.268 --> 15:37.270
aren't registered to vote
at all.

15:37.304 --> 15:38.405
I repeat. Okay, so?

15:38.438 --> 15:40.740
Okay, so...

15:40.773 --> 15:42.842
if I can't win over people
in this neighborhood,

15:42.875 --> 15:44.444
where Brown is already
so ingrained,

15:44.477 --> 15:46.479
then maybe we can appeal
to people in a neighborhood

15:46.513 --> 15:47.847
where he doesn't
set foot at all.

15:47.880 --> 15:51.018
As in the royal "we"?
-Yeah.

15:51.051 --> 15:52.919
You know, sometimes
my heart is so big

15:52.952 --> 15:54.654
I can't even stand it.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.089
What's the game plan?

15:56.123 --> 15:57.624
-I love you.
-I know you do.

15:57.657 --> 15:59.159
-I don't say it enough.
-You don't say it enough.

15:59.192 --> 16:01.261
-Hey, Mom.
-Hi, Bug.

16:01.294 --> 16:02.362
How are you?

16:02.395 --> 16:04.597
-Terrible.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.766
Audio ate a rock.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.168
REBECCA :
What?

16:08.201 --> 16:09.502
The vet said that I
have to decide

16:09.536 --> 16:10.837
if we're gonna have surgery
to remove it,

16:10.870 --> 16:12.139
or if I should just
take him home

16:12.172 --> 16:13.706
and see if he just...
he poops it out.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.342
And if he doesn't poop it out,

16:15.375 --> 16:17.477
it could rupture his intestine.

16:17.510 --> 16:19.779
So it seems like both options
could kill him.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.948
Tell me what to do, Mom.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.884
I...

16:24.917 --> 16:27.020
I think that you should
take him home.

16:27.054 --> 16:29.289
You know, you'll feel more
in control that way.

16:29.322 --> 16:32.025
And then, if there's any
sign of distress,

16:32.059 --> 16:34.327
you can just take him
back in immediately.

16:34.361 --> 16:37.630
You know,
if my maybe-baby is a real baby,

16:37.664 --> 16:40.233
I'm gonna have to have you
move into our building.

16:40.267 --> 16:42.702
Mm.

16:42.735 --> 16:45.305
Bug, I love that you are
calling me for advice,

16:45.338 --> 16:49.576
and believe me,
I'm-I'm always happy to give it,

16:49.609 --> 16:52.912
but can I let you in
on a little secret?

16:52.945 --> 16:58.051
Toby and Audio
and your maybe-baby

16:58.085 --> 17:01.221
that I think is going to
turn into a real baby...

17:01.254 --> 17:04.691
There's gonna be a million
things, a million decisions

17:04.724 --> 17:06.926
you're gonna have to make
for them, and you will.

17:06.959 --> 17:09.762
You'll do exactly what I did.
You're gonna...

17:09.796 --> 17:14.234
take a deep breath...
and make a choice...

17:14.267 --> 17:19.539
and just hope you didn't
screw things up too badly.

17:21.241 --> 17:23.376
-Rebecca, let me explain.
-Okay. Help me out here, Jack.

17:23.410 --> 17:24.377
Help me out.

17:24.411 --> 17:26.213
So, when I said "no boxing,"

17:26.246 --> 17:29.015
what about that says, "I should
teach Randall how to box"?

17:29.048 --> 17:31.518
You know, he's getting
bullied at school.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.286
-Yeah.

17:33.320 --> 17:34.787
Some new kid is picking on him,

17:34.821 --> 17:36.623
and he's worried that things
are gonna get physical.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.591
But he doesn't want us
to make a big deal about it

17:38.625 --> 17:40.893
because he thinks, and I agree,

17:40.927 --> 17:42.629
that's just gonna
make things worse.

17:42.662 --> 17:45.064
He's 12. You can't
blindly follow the wishes

17:45.098 --> 17:46.366
of a 12-year-old.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.101
Especially when it comes
to his safety.

17:48.135 --> 17:50.237
Jack, if you feel the need
to go secretly

17:50.270 --> 17:52.038
punch some guys
as a stress reliever

17:52.071 --> 17:54.807
for all the things you don't
talk about, that's one thing.

17:54.841 --> 17:56.776
But you cannot
keep things from me

17:56.809 --> 17:58.311
when they're about our son.

18:00.980 --> 18:02.249
You're right. I'm sorry.

18:02.282 --> 18:04.917
We need to call his principal.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.089
No one's here.

18:10.123 --> 18:11.558
Of course not.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.393
Almost all these stores are
out of business.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.128
Oh, there's someone.

18:15.162 --> 18:16.296
-Hi.
-Hi.

18:16.329 --> 18:18.298
Would you like to buy
some Girl Scout cookies?

18:18.331 --> 18:21.000
My daughters used to sell these
a million years ago.

18:21.033 --> 18:22.769
Let me see, um...

18:22.802 --> 18:25.004
I'll take four boxes
of the shortbread.

18:25.037 --> 18:27.006
That'll be $16, please.

18:27.039 --> 18:29.008
Oh, I'm sorry. Cash only.

18:29.041 --> 18:30.109
No, we're not.

18:30.143 --> 18:31.511
We just need to use the swiper.

18:31.544 --> 18:32.579
The what, now?

18:32.612 --> 18:34.647
You didn't bring the swiper?

18:34.681 --> 18:37.350
What is the swiper?

18:37.384 --> 18:38.618
The little thing that you put

18:38.651 --> 18:40.119
on your phone
and swipe credit cards?

18:40.153 --> 18:41.621
Everyone knows
you need a swiper.

18:41.654 --> 18:43.790
I'm sorry, I don't have
any cash on me.

18:43.823 --> 18:45.792
Uh, we can...

18:45.825 --> 18:47.860
You know what, you can
give us your credit card number,

18:47.894 --> 18:49.929
and we'll just write it down
on a piece of paper

18:49.962 --> 18:52.265
and tear it up
right after we run it.

18:52.299 --> 18:54.367
Um, I don't think so.

18:54.401 --> 18:56.169
Good luck.

18:56.203 --> 18:57.804
Thanks a lot, Mom.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.339
I wish we went with Riley.

18:59.372 --> 19:02.175
She texted that they've already
sold 40 boxes today.

19:02.209 --> 19:04.177
All right, I'm doing
my best here, okay?

19:04.211 --> 19:05.712
I'm sorry I'm not as good
as Riley's mom.

19:05.745 --> 19:07.614
Yeah. Me, too.

19:07.647 --> 19:10.217
Riley's mom would have
never forgotten the swiper,

19:10.250 --> 19:11.784
because she doesn't
totally suck.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.720
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

19:19.592 --> 19:21.027
Come on, let's go.

19:22.729 --> 19:24.497
Come on!

19:29.168 --> 19:31.070
Okay, thank you so much,
Principal Sammartino.

19:31.103 --> 19:33.306
Okay, bye-bye.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.642
What'd he say?
-Um...

19:35.675 --> 19:37.910
there is no one named Dylan
in his class,

19:37.944 --> 19:40.647
and there are no new students
from New York at all.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.549
Wait, that doesn't make
any sense.

19:42.582 --> 19:44.351
Why would he make up a bully?

19:44.384 --> 19:46.919
I have no idea.

19:46.953 --> 19:50.657
-But we have to go talk to him.

19:50.690 --> 19:53.059
Let me talk to him.
No, let me talk to him.

19:53.092 --> 19:56.896
My-my son lied to me.
I need to find out why.

19:56.929 --> 19:58.931
Okay.

20:03.135 --> 20:05.305
The reason I...

20:07.540 --> 20:09.742
Boxing helps me.

20:09.776 --> 20:12.312
Okay? It...

20:13.813 --> 20:16.549
...helps me with stuff.

20:16.583 --> 20:20.052
Stuff I can't think about.

20:20.086 --> 20:25.258
It... quiets things.

20:25.292 --> 20:27.527
I wish I could explain it.

20:27.560 --> 20:31.130
I don't know any other...

20:53.920 --> 20:55.822
:
Okay. Okay.

21:17.344 --> 21:21.914
My mom lost a lot of jobs
through the years.

21:21.948 --> 21:23.916
It was always
really hard for her.

21:23.950 --> 21:27.754
You know, I was just about
to come talk to you guys.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.956
I am sorry about earlier,

21:29.989 --> 21:32.725
but you really don't
have to worry about me.

21:34.894 --> 21:38.598
You know what Randall
told me one time?

21:38.631 --> 21:41.300
He called me exceptional.

21:41.334 --> 21:44.937
And he said it so easy,
like it wasn't a big deal.

21:44.971 --> 21:47.006
I remember thinking,

21:47.039 --> 21:49.576
he must think people have
told me this before.

21:51.544 --> 21:56.182
I bet he's told you before
that you're exceptional,

21:56.215 --> 21:58.184
because you are.

21:59.386 --> 22:00.887
Thanks, Dej.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.822
You know,
but I don't know that...

22:02.855 --> 22:04.624
Randall thinks so.

22:04.657 --> 22:09.295
I mean, he loves you like he's
in a Disney movie or something,

22:09.328 --> 22:13.065
like he hears tiny
forest animals singing

22:13.099 --> 22:16.603
or playing kazoos or something
whenever you walk into a room.

22:17.837 --> 22:20.973
But if you're sad,

22:21.007 --> 22:24.343
then you should talk to him.

22:24.377 --> 22:27.179
He'll tell you
you're exceptional,

22:27.213 --> 22:30.517
and he'll say it so easy

22:30.550 --> 22:32.619
that you'll believe it.

22:34.787 --> 22:37.424
:
Wow.

22:37.457 --> 22:39.492
You are really good
at these talks.

22:39.526 --> 22:41.594
You live in this house
for a while,

22:41.628 --> 22:43.963
you learn your way
around a talk.

22:49.101 --> 22:51.337
Oh, come on in, little mamas.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.305
Come on. Everything's okay.

22:54.441 --> 22:58.545
I'm so sorry that I exploded.

22:58.578 --> 23:00.246
Okay?

23:00.279 --> 23:02.248
It was not about you.

23:02.281 --> 23:05.718
-No. I was being a brat.
-Okay.

23:05.752 --> 23:08.020
-It was ten percent about you.

23:08.054 --> 23:10.156
90% not.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.194
KEVIN:
You got it?

23:16.496 --> 23:17.930
There you go. That's a good one.

23:17.964 --> 23:19.398
Register to vote,
it'll last longer.

23:19.432 --> 23:22.068
Okay, you're all set, Mrs. Park.

23:22.101 --> 23:24.403
Hope to see you at the polls.
Thank you.

23:26.272 --> 23:27.607
Hey, how you doing, sir?
Randall Pearson.

23:27.640 --> 23:30.242
Hey. Let me see if I have this.

23:30.276 --> 23:33.780
Um, you can't make any inroads
with Sol Brown's base,

23:33.813 --> 23:35.482
so you're getting
Koreans to register,

23:35.515 --> 23:37.116
hoping that they'll vote for you

23:37.149 --> 23:39.619
'cause you're related
to The Baby-Man.

23:39.652 --> 23:41.153
RANDALL:
I'm sorry, The Baby

23:41.187 --> 23:44.156
Yeah, it's what they call
The Manny in South Korea.

23:44.190 --> 23:46.392
Dude, you are so transparent.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.561
I bet you've never
stepped foot here before,

23:48.595 --> 23:50.062
and if you get elected-- if--

23:50.096 --> 23:51.430
you'll never
step foot here again.

23:59.205 --> 24:00.740
Hey.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.942
You're right.

24:02.975 --> 24:04.477
You're right, man,
I-I've never been

24:04.511 --> 24:08.114
in this neighborhood before,
but I'm here now.

24:11.450 --> 24:15.755
But just on the way in here,
I saw empty storefronts.

24:18.491 --> 24:20.660
I saw badly patched potholes.

24:22.962 --> 24:25.197
I saw a guy carrying his
bicycle tire underneath his arms

24:25.231 --> 24:26.866
because he knew that
was the only way

24:26.899 --> 24:28.267
to keep from getting it stolen.

24:32.004 --> 24:34.173
RANDALL: But I don't know
what this community

24:34.206 --> 24:35.975
truly wants...

24:38.377 --> 24:39.746
...or truly needs.

24:42.048 --> 24:45.752
But if you'll talk to me,
I'll listen.

24:47.920 --> 24:50.189
As long as your kick-ass sister

24:50.222 --> 24:51.724
keeps interpreting
for me, that is.

24:55.394 --> 24:59.498
I, uh, I only know one word
in Korean so far.

25:01.601 --> 25:03.269
My brother taught it to me.

25:06.706 --> 25:08.507
Kamsahamnida.

25:23.455 --> 25:24.891
-Hey.
-Hey.

25:24.924 --> 25:27.326
-Oh, he's okay.

25:27.359 --> 25:29.028
Just swallowed a little rock.

25:31.397 --> 25:33.165
Just gonna monitor him, and, uh,

25:33.199 --> 25:35.534
he'll be fine
as long as he poops.

25:36.736 --> 25:40.272
You got dressed.

25:40.306 --> 25:42.041
You felt good enough
to get dressed.

25:42.074 --> 25:43.843
That's huge.

25:43.876 --> 25:45.511
Uh, except that I don't.

25:45.544 --> 25:48.447
-I-I don't.

25:48.480 --> 25:52.685
I want to, and I-I-I thought
if I went through the motions

25:52.719 --> 25:54.553
that I would, but I don't.

25:54.587 --> 25:57.023
-I'm starting to get worried.

25:57.056 --> 25:59.025
That you're gonna leave me.

25:59.058 --> 26:01.093
Not now, but eventually.

26:01.127 --> 26:02.895
Toby, what are you
talking about?

26:02.929 --> 26:04.296
You didn't sign up for this.

26:04.330 --> 26:05.632
And you're pregnant.

26:05.665 --> 26:07.934
I'm the one who's supposed
to be taking care of you,

26:07.967 --> 26:09.736
and instead I'm this
pathetic burden.

26:09.769 --> 26:11.070
You must be freaking out

26:11.103 --> 26:13.572
that this is what
you're stuck with.

26:13.606 --> 26:16.809
Look, I tried
my very hardest today, and...

26:19.445 --> 26:22.281
I'm sorry.

26:24.016 --> 26:26.052
Tobe!

26:26.085 --> 26:27.654
Toby, I think
he wants to go out.

26:27.687 --> 26:30.256
I'm gonna take him out.
Come with us?

26:32.291 --> 26:33.459
No.

26:37.964 --> 26:38.965
Toby.

26:41.467 --> 26:44.370
I think you should
go on a walk with us.

26:49.608 --> 26:51.043
Okay.

26:55.815 --> 26:57.249
Oh, yeah.

26:59.318 --> 27:01.153
Thanks, Kev. Appreciate it, man.

27:01.187 --> 27:03.589
Yeah, man, these muscles
aren't just for show.

27:03.622 --> 27:05.157
Actually,
that's not true at all.

27:05.191 --> 27:06.659
They're mostly just for show.

27:08.227 --> 27:11.097
You know, Randall, you wanted
to find your birth dad,

27:11.130 --> 27:13.800
and you found him,
which led you to his building,

27:13.833 --> 27:17.569
which you bought, which led you
to run for city council.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.273
You want to do something,
you just do it.

27:21.307 --> 27:22.775
Right, you don't...
you don't care if it

27:22.809 --> 27:25.444
makes sense
to any of us or not. It's...

27:25.477 --> 27:27.013
It's remarkable.

27:27.046 --> 27:29.849
When you have one of those
things inside you,

27:29.882 --> 27:32.151
you just go for it.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.988
-Yeah, I guess I do.
-I guess you do.

27:40.159 --> 27:42.962
Randall, I've got one
of those things inside me.

27:42.995 --> 27:45.364
About Dad. I can't let it go.

27:46.933 --> 27:49.501
You need to peel the wallpaper.

27:49.535 --> 27:51.103
I need to peel the wallpaper.

27:53.072 --> 27:55.274
I hope you find what
you're looking for, brother.

28:04.851 --> 28:07.820
Is Mom really mad
about the boxing?

28:07.854 --> 28:09.421
No.

28:09.455 --> 28:13.692
She's not so mad,
but we are both confused.

28:15.361 --> 28:18.230
We spoke to your
principal, Randall.

28:18.264 --> 28:19.866
We know there is no Dylan.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.435
Yeah. So you...

28:23.469 --> 28:25.604
you lied to me.

28:29.375 --> 28:31.343
I wanted you
to teach me how to box,

28:31.377 --> 28:33.913
but I knew you wouldn't
if I didn't have a good reason.

28:33.946 --> 28:36.883
Okay, so you made up
a fake bully?

28:38.084 --> 28:40.052
Why did you want
to learn so bad?

28:41.220 --> 28:43.355
So I could be more like you.

28:43.389 --> 28:45.557
Randall,

28:45.591 --> 28:49.695
boxing is just one part of me.

28:49.728 --> 28:52.698
Yeah, that Kevin has.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.366
What do you mean by that?

28:54.400 --> 28:57.069
Kevin's good at fighting, Dad,
and he wins everything.

28:57.103 --> 28:59.471
Wait, hold on a second, so you
wanted to learn how to box

28:59.505 --> 29:00.706
so that you could
fight your brother?

29:00.739 --> 29:02.308
No.

29:03.742 --> 29:05.744
Kevin's tough,
and he got that from you,

29:05.778 --> 29:07.146
and I didn't.

29:07.179 --> 29:10.082
Dad, the thing is

29:10.116 --> 29:14.887
that I know I'm your son,
but Kevin is your...

29:14.921 --> 29:18.090
son-son,

29:18.124 --> 29:20.827
and he got DNA stuff
from you that I didn't.

29:20.860 --> 29:22.962
You need to teach me.

29:22.995 --> 29:24.997
I need to learn how
to become a fighter, Dad,

29:25.031 --> 29:26.465
if I'm gonna get
anywhere in life.

29:26.498 --> 29:27.934
-No, you don't.
-No, Dad, I just...

29:27.967 --> 29:30.169
No, Randall, no, you don't.

29:32.972 --> 29:35.975
Look, first of all,

29:36.008 --> 29:38.945
you are my son-son.

29:38.978 --> 29:41.113
Okay? And second...

29:43.215 --> 29:45.184
...you've got something
even greater

29:45.217 --> 29:47.686
than knowing how
to throw a punch.

29:47.719 --> 29:50.522
You-you've got a brain

29:50.556 --> 29:53.993
so smart that you tricked
your old man

29:54.026 --> 29:57.196
into thinking that I
had to teach you how to fight.

29:57.229 --> 29:59.631
And that...

29:59.665 --> 30:04.036
is gonna be your
secret weapon, Southpaw.

30:12.979 --> 30:15.381
So, uh, how many voters
you register?

30:15.414 --> 30:16.949
About 200.

30:16.983 --> 30:20.786
Ah, well, you only need
around, uh, 20,000 more.

30:20.819 --> 30:23.222
Well, you got
to start somewhere.

30:25.524 --> 30:27.693
You know, my grandmother
has spent the last few hours

30:27.726 --> 30:30.529
talking about the black man
with nice hands.

30:30.562 --> 30:32.531
She's got a thing about hands.

30:32.564 --> 30:37.103
Well, tell her thanks.
I, uh... I moisturize.

30:39.405 --> 30:42.909
My grandmother has never voted
once in her life.

30:42.942 --> 30:44.977
In Korea, she didn't
really have the access,

30:45.011 --> 30:47.346
and when she became
a citizen over here,

30:47.379 --> 30:49.515
it was always clear to her
that no politician cares

30:49.548 --> 30:52.919
what an old woman from a little
village north of Seoul wants.

30:55.021 --> 30:58.057
But today,
she registered to vote,

30:58.090 --> 31:02.895
for the first time in 75 years,

31:02.929 --> 31:06.532
because you made her believe
that you care.

31:06.565 --> 31:08.600
And, plus, the nice hands.

31:09.768 --> 31:11.537
I do care.

31:13.639 --> 31:15.607
I have a master's in poli-sci,

31:15.641 --> 31:17.609
and I was an aide
in a congressional campaign

31:17.643 --> 31:20.612
in Ohio's 13th in 2016.

31:20.646 --> 31:24.016
I know you don't have
a campaign manager.

31:24.050 --> 31:25.651
I want the gig.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.622
I'm sorry, I didn't get
your name earlier.

31:30.656 --> 31:34.426
Jae-won, but most non-Koreans
call me John.

31:36.929 --> 31:40.899
Me and my nice hands are happy
to have you on board, Jae-won.

31:42.434 --> 31:45.637
.
-Okay. All right.

31:45.671 --> 31:47.706
Kamsahamnida.
-That's good.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.675
-Kamsahamnida. Kamsahamnida.
-That's how you
pronounce it. Yeah.

31:54.346 --> 31:56.748
You know, I'm still
thinking about it.

31:56.782 --> 32:00.486
You know, I go in there wanting
to ground him for lying to me,

32:00.519 --> 32:02.121
and then when I left,

32:02.154 --> 32:04.123
I wanted to hug him tighter
than humanly possible.

32:04.156 --> 32:06.125
-I just...

32:06.158 --> 32:08.827
I can't get my head
around that kid sometimes.

32:08.860 --> 32:11.063
Yeah.

32:11.097 --> 32:13.065
Speaking of heads.

32:15.101 --> 32:19.071
I got you this today.

32:19.105 --> 32:22.708
Just a little something,
not a big deal.

32:25.677 --> 32:27.613
Is this a test?

32:27.646 --> 32:29.015
It's headgear.

32:29.048 --> 32:31.083
Yeah, I know it's headgear.

32:31.117 --> 32:32.918
If boxing is important to you,

32:32.951 --> 32:36.555
I just want you
to be safe, okay?

32:45.964 --> 32:48.067
You know, my brother and I,
we used to box?

32:50.369 --> 32:52.338
Yeah.

32:52.371 --> 32:56.675
There was this local, ancient
boxer in our neighborhood.

32:56.708 --> 33:00.012
Steve Bihuniak, "The Squid."

33:00.046 --> 33:02.614
He had this old pair
of boxing mitts that...

33:02.648 --> 33:05.751
we used to go over there and
we'd each put one of them on.

33:07.986 --> 33:11.290
: And-and then
we'd roll toilet paper up

33:11.323 --> 33:13.859
and-and stuff it in our teeth
like they were mouth guards,

33:13.892 --> 33:18.164
and, you know, we'd have
these one-handed boxing matches.

33:19.998 --> 33:22.734
Wow.

33:24.203 --> 33:27.005
These are great.

33:27.039 --> 33:29.908
All right, you win.

33:29.941 --> 33:31.910
Win what?

33:31.943 --> 33:33.912
Teach me how to box.

33:33.945 --> 33:37.249
-If everybody else knows how.

33:37.283 --> 33:38.684
Here.

33:38.717 --> 33:40.686
-Put that on.
: I'm not...

33:40.719 --> 33:43.089
-not wearing this.
-You got to protect your head.

33:43.122 --> 33:45.657
Just put on the gloves.

33:45.691 --> 33:47.259
Here. There's one...

33:47.293 --> 33:48.594
-Uh-huh.
-In there tight. Okay.

33:48.627 --> 33:50.496
-Yeah. Okay.
-Hold on a sec.

33:50.529 --> 33:53.765
Put this second one on--
just, like, push it down.

33:53.799 --> 33:56.335
-There you go. Okay.
-Okay.

33:56.368 --> 33:57.603
-Now get them up.

33:57.636 --> 33:59.205
-Oh, wow.

33:59.238 --> 34:01.407
I mean, you in a nightgown
with boxing gloves on,

34:01.440 --> 34:03.041
I mean, that was a fantasy

34:03.075 --> 34:04.443
I didn't even know
that I was missing.

34:04.476 --> 34:06.912
Shut up, Jack. How do I do this?

34:06.945 --> 34:08.380
All right,
send us one past here.

34:08.414 --> 34:09.948
-Yeah.
-Oof. Throw the other one.

34:09.981 --> 34:12.584
Oh. Yeah.

34:12.618 --> 34:14.620
-Hi.
-That's not so bad.

34:16.822 --> 34:18.224
Thank you.

34:18.257 --> 34:21.193
Yeah. Of course.

34:21.227 --> 34:24.663
Yes, I have the budget proposal
right here.

34:25.731 --> 34:29.535
Mary, let me call you back.

34:29.568 --> 34:31.937
Randall.

34:31.970 --> 34:33.439
Pleasant surprise.

34:33.472 --> 34:35.241
You're good.

34:36.908 --> 34:38.877
At church today,
you were gracious,

34:38.910 --> 34:42.080
but you made it very clear
you don't think I belong.

34:42.114 --> 34:43.482
Well played.

34:43.515 --> 34:45.151
JACK:
Come on, slip, slip, slip.

34:45.184 --> 34:47.819
-ALL: Ooh!

34:47.853 --> 34:50.222
He gets hit square in the jaw,
spits out blood,

34:50.256 --> 34:52.158
and what does he do? He smiles.

34:52.191 --> 34:53.792
Why would he do that?

34:53.825 --> 34:58.464
Well, uh, I've been
at this a while.

34:58.497 --> 35:02.668
Yeah, well, I'm still learning.

35:02.701 --> 35:05.137
JACK: He doesn't want his
opponent to know that he's hurt.

35:05.171 --> 35:07.339
There's this thing
that some fighters do.

35:07.373 --> 35:09.975
Okay? If their opponent
hits them really hard,

35:10.008 --> 35:12.478
they just plaster on
a big old smile.

35:14.713 --> 35:17.249
Go. Stay on him,
stay on him. Go.

35:17.283 --> 35:20.452
I did get a campaign manager.

35:20.486 --> 35:22.654
His name is Jae-won Yoo.

35:25.557 --> 35:27.493
I'm going to win Koreatown.

35:37.669 --> 35:39.771
I'm not gonna leave you.

35:39.805 --> 35:41.373
What?

35:41.407 --> 35:43.008
I signed up for better or worse.

35:43.041 --> 35:44.876
Yeah, no, I know. It-it...

35:44.910 --> 35:47.112
It's just that you don't...
you don't how long...

35:47.145 --> 35:50.549
Like, this is gonna be a part
of me for my entire life,

35:50.582 --> 35:52.117
so it's...

35:52.150 --> 35:53.885
Go on.

35:53.919 --> 35:57.523
Babe, better or worse.

35:59.258 --> 36:01.827
Ever since I was a little girl,

36:01.860 --> 36:04.296
I have needed
to be taken care of.

36:04.330 --> 36:06.498
First, when I was
a little chubby kid,

36:06.532 --> 36:08.734
I needed to be coddled.

36:08.767 --> 36:11.169
And then as a teenager
whose dad died,

36:11.203 --> 36:12.904
I needed to be comforted
all the time.

36:12.938 --> 36:15.974
I'm 38 years old, and I still
call my mom for advice

36:16.007 --> 36:19.211
when I'm going through
a rough spot, and-and you...

36:19.245 --> 36:22.748
wow, you have talked me off
of more emotional ledges

36:22.781 --> 36:24.216
than I can count.

36:26.418 --> 36:28.320
But the truth is I'm strong.

36:28.354 --> 36:31.056
And the things
that I've been through

36:31.089 --> 36:33.925
have made me tough as hell.

36:33.959 --> 36:36.728
So if you think this
is gonna scare me away,

36:36.762 --> 36:38.597
you've got another thing coming.

36:38.630 --> 36:41.066
I'm gonna get you
through this, Tobe.

36:43.602 --> 36:49.140
And if you fall again, I will be
right here to pick you back up.

36:51.477 --> 36:54.045
In sickness and health,
for better, for worse.

36:54.079 --> 36:56.114
I'm talking forever.

36:56.147 --> 36:58.284
* Days go by

37:01.119 --> 37:02.254
* Don't remember...

37:02.288 --> 37:03.955
You're incredible.

37:10.462 --> 37:12.230
He's pooping.

37:12.264 --> 37:13.432
-Hey, look at you.

37:13.465 --> 37:15.200
He's pooping.

37:15.233 --> 37:18.570
-All right.
-* Yesterday becomes tomorrow

37:22.007 --> 37:25.076
* And I can see the day
after tomorrow... *

37:25.110 --> 37:27.746
-Hi.

37:27.779 --> 37:29.981
-One night, Kevin.
-I know.

37:30.015 --> 37:31.883
-I asked for one night.
-I know, I know, I know, I know.

37:31.917 --> 37:33.752
I know you did, and I'm sorry
to interrupt your raisining,

37:33.785 --> 37:35.287
really, I am, and as penance,

37:35.321 --> 37:37.289
I promise I'm finally
gonna sit down with you

37:37.323 --> 37:39.425
and I'm gonna watch
that documentary Planet Earth,

37:39.458 --> 37:41.560
the one that you can't stop
talking about.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.529
But I really need
to talk to you.

37:44.763 --> 37:46.365
Go on.

37:47.633 --> 37:50.402
Okay, uh...

37:50.436 --> 37:52.170
I-I never...

37:52.203 --> 37:56.475
I never really knew
how to ask my dad... things.

37:56.508 --> 37:59.244
Or-or what to ask him, even.

37:59.277 --> 38:03.281
And, um, well, here.

38:04.282 --> 38:05.917
What is this?

38:05.951 --> 38:08.086
Why do people always ask that?
If you open it up,

38:08.119 --> 38:09.988
then you'll know what it is.

38:11.657 --> 38:16.962
* Then I won't have to find
a thing to say... *

38:22.000 --> 38:26.137
That is a visa application
for a trip to Vietnam.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.609
I need to go there, Zoe.

38:30.642 --> 38:32.811
I'm gonna go to the place
where my dad last served,

38:32.844 --> 38:34.212
I'm gonna track down that woman,

38:34.245 --> 38:35.947
and I'm gonna figure out
my dad's story.

38:35.981 --> 38:37.716
And I-I know it sounds
absolutely crazy,

38:37.749 --> 38:38.984
and it's probably even crazier

38:39.017 --> 38:40.352
that I'm asking you
to come with me

38:40.386 --> 38:42.153
because our relationship
is brand-new,

38:42.187 --> 38:44.322
and it's fresh and it's fun
and 14 hours on a plane

38:44.356 --> 38:47.292
and sharing a hotel room and a
bathroom with no air freshener,

38:47.325 --> 38:48.627
just gross.

38:48.660 --> 38:50.496
But I just... I-I figured maybe

38:50.529 --> 38:52.230
the documentarian in you
would dig it, you know?

38:52.263 --> 38:54.299
Or maybe the part of you
that digs me would dig it.

38:54.332 --> 38:56.568
I don't know, I just-- I feel
like I'm talking way too much,

38:56.602 --> 38:59.838
and I need you to help me stop.

38:59.871 --> 39:01.973
* Now not me...

39:02.007 --> 39:04.510
Vietnam, huh?

39:04.543 --> 39:08.013
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

39:09.681 --> 39:10.882
-Yeah.

39:10.916 --> 39:11.917
-Yeah.

39:13.184 --> 39:14.420
* When my mind's gone

39:15.521 --> 39:18.089
* When my mind's gone.

39:18.123 --> 39:19.758
RANDALL:
Beth Pearson.

39:19.791 --> 39:21.760
Love of my life.

39:21.793 --> 39:23.729
I'm so glad you are up,

39:23.762 --> 39:26.765
because I have got the news,
baby girl.

39:26.798 --> 39:28.767
Can I get a drumroll, please?

39:31.069 --> 39:33.338
I got a campaign manager.

39:33.371 --> 39:35.340
And a new love for bibimbap.

39:35.373 --> 39:37.543
We got to start adding Korean
to the takeout menu.

39:37.576 --> 39:39.545
That's great to hear, babe.

39:41.780 --> 39:44.215
Nope.

39:44.249 --> 39:46.251
What is it?

39:47.453 --> 39:49.421
What's wrong?

39:54.893 --> 39:56.862
I got fired.

39:56.895 --> 39:59.665
I know. They're idiots.

40:02.634 --> 40:05.303
For the past few weeks,

40:05.336 --> 40:09.641
I've been pretending
that I'm fine,

40:09.675 --> 40:13.445
but I'm not, babe.

40:13.479 --> 40:15.280
I'm not fine.

40:15.313 --> 40:17.315
Okay.

40:20.418 --> 40:22.420
I'm really sorry.

40:28.994 --> 40:31.663
Why didn't you say anything?

40:31.697 --> 40:35.400
'Cause I know you're gonna say,
like, any company would be,

40:35.433 --> 40:39.104
you know, lucky to have me,
or that I'm extraordinary

40:39.137 --> 40:40.506
and exceptional-- I-I just...

40:40.539 --> 40:43.074
I don't feel
like hearing that right now,

40:43.108 --> 40:45.410
because I don't...
I don't feel like it's true.

40:45.443 --> 40:47.278
Well, you must have been
sipping on crazy juice

40:47.312 --> 40:48.847
if you don't think that's true.

40:48.880 --> 40:51.717
Well, tell that to all the jobs
I sent my résumé to.

41:05.396 --> 41:07.332
Join my campaign.

41:07.365 --> 41:09.635
No.

41:09.668 --> 41:11.803
-No, I don't want a pity job.

41:11.837 --> 41:13.672
-It's not a pity job.
-I... You already have
a campaign manager.

41:13.705 --> 41:16.307
Jae-won says if we want to stand
a chance of winning this thing,

41:16.341 --> 41:18.710
I have to hire a strong team.

41:18.744 --> 41:21.647
And I already got 20 years of
data that says that Beth Pearson

41:21.680 --> 41:24.850
is the best teammate there is.

41:24.883 --> 41:27.819
You are
my missing ingredient, baby.

41:27.853 --> 41:30.989
You're the horseradish
in my Bloody Mary.

41:31.022 --> 41:32.624
We pulled all-nighters

41:32.658 --> 41:34.793
in an empty apartment
with the exception of a mattress

41:34.826 --> 41:37.162
to get each other
through grad school.

41:37.195 --> 41:39.698
We threw a wedding for $5,000

41:39.731 --> 41:42.834
by negotiating the hell out of
the entire Tri-State Area,

41:42.868 --> 41:45.370
and people are still talking
about them crab puffs.

41:45.403 --> 41:48.239
-Them crab puffs.

41:48.273 --> 41:52.744
Anything we take on, we crush.

41:52.778 --> 41:55.180
You swear this
is not a pity job?

41:55.213 --> 41:59.184
I wouldn't dare offer you
a pity job.

42:02.954 --> 42:05.591
You really do hear
forest animals with kazoos

42:05.624 --> 42:07.058
when you see me, don't you?

42:07.092 --> 42:08.594
What's that?

42:15.366 --> 42:22.040
-Let's win you an election.
-That's what I'm talking about.
