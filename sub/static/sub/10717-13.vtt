Previously on
"The Americans"...

00:21.120 --> 00:23.088
Don't be scared, sweetheart.

00:23.120 --> 00:24.644
Uhh! (moaning)

00:24.690 --> 00:28.410
(grunting)

00:28.460 --> 00:32.920
It's...dangerous
what you and dad do?

00:32.960 --> 00:34.029
Sometimes.

00:34.060 --> 00:36.062
Henry's really close
to Mr. Beeman,

00:36.100 --> 00:38.762
and we_ have no idea what
he's saying to hIm about us.

00:38.800 --> 00:40.165
You always say
we'll get through this,

00:40.200 --> 00:41.861
but you never say how.

00:41.900 --> 00:43.936
PHILIP: You wanna be Matthew's
friend? Be Matthew's friend,

00:43.970 --> 00:46.109
but don't do anything
because of us.

00:46.140 --> 00:47.903
STAN: I just saw Burov.

00:47.940 --> 00:49.908
He gave me enough pieces
to put something together.

00:49.950 --> 00:53.113
Probably an agent in place
working on biological weapons.

00:53.150 --> 00:56.916
Just got something new in
from Fort Detrick.

00:56.950 --> 00:59.510
A modified strain
of the Lassa virus --

00:59.560 --> 01:03.758
causes a hemorrhagic fever
that liquefies your organs.

01:03.790 --> 01:06.099
Louisville field office found
a William Crandall.

01:06.130 --> 01:09.190
Foster Medical, right?

01:09.230 --> 01:10.766
Got him.

01:10.800 --> 01:13.530
I know you've lost your sense
of why we do this,

01:13.570 --> 01:16.368
but I promise you,

01:16.410 --> 01:17.729
it matters.

01:17.770 --> 01:20.330
You'll do this one last thing.

06:31.720 --> 06:35.986
maybe I need to learn

Stan didn't come home

2:00.

14:02.700 --> 14:05.260
I told Paige a little bit
about Smolensk.

what it looks like now?

14:14.780 --> 14:16.111
Back home?

14:18.190 --> 14:21.079
It could be
totally different.

14:24.930 --> 14:27.091

Mr. Crandall.

17:41.290 --> 17:43.622
I'm Agent Beeman.

17:43.660 --> 17:46.788
This is Agent Aderholt.

We're with the FBI.

17:48.930 --> 17:52.195

17:52.230 --> 17:54.437
At a time like this,

17:54.470 --> 17:57.439
we can all just be
human beings.

18:01.080 --> 18:07.371
If there's anything we can do
to make you more comfortable...

18:07.420 --> 18:11.811
Comfortable. (chuckles)

18:11.850 --> 18:16.583
(weakly) There is nothing you
or a-anyone can do

18:16.620 --> 18:18.281
to make me comfortable.

18:21.130 --> 18:22.449
In a few days,

18:22.500 --> 18:27.665
everything that's inside me
that...

18:27.700 --> 18:30.601
matters.. .

18:30.640 --> 18:33.905
will have oozed_out
through my orifices.

18:33.940 --> 18:36.932
(labored breathing)

18:43.490 --> 18:45.617
I'm a dead man.

18:49.460 --> 18:51.985
It's a very unusual feeling.

18:57.630 --> 18:59.791
Would you like a Coke?

20:23.990 --> 20:26.117
Hi, hon.

20:26.150 --> 20:27.287
(keys clatter)

20:35.130 --> 20:36.552
Alice had her baby.

20:36.600 --> 20:40.024
Oh. Boy or girl?

20:40.070 --> 20:41.594
Girl. Claire Louise.
Oh.

20:41.640 --> 20:44.359
Pastor Tim left a message.
I haven't called back yet.

20:44.410 --> 20:48.130
I didn't know what to say.

20:48.180 --> 20:52.139
Well, I guess we should, um,
all go visit them.

20:52.180 --> 20:54.819
All three of us?

20:54.850 --> 20:57.944
Henry, too.

20:57.990 --> 20:59.946
Is it too soon?
(Sighs)

20:59.990 --> 21:03.187
How soon until you wanted
visitors when you had me?

21:05.260 --> 21:08.457
I didn't have
many friends, so...

21:09.800 --> 21:11.165
(sighs)

21:11.200 --> 21:14.328
Maybe I should go first
after church tomorrow

21:14.370 --> 21:15.997
just to say hi.

21:16.040 --> 21:18.429
Yeah, call first.
Yeah.

21:18.470 --> 21:21.769
And then we can all go see them
later when they're home.

21:21.810 --> 21:25.177
That makes sense.

21:25.210 --> 21:28.008
I have a gift you can take.
Good.

21:31.190 --> 21:33.579
Where's Dad? Working?

21:33.620 --> 21:39.627
No, um, he's...at this --

21:39.660 --> 21:42.094
it's sort of like a class.

21:42.130 --> 21:45.099
He's at a class?

21:45.130 --> 21:47.496
It's called EST.

21:47.540 --> 21:50.031
Uh, it's like
a seminar in...

21:52.740 --> 21:54.230
...thinking about yourself.

21:55.540 --> 21:57.849
Remember, he went
with Stan one time?

21:57.880 --> 22:00.075
Right. Okay.

22:02.080 --> 22:05.117
(sighs) Did you eat?

22:05.150 --> 22:06.219
No.

22:06.250 --> 22:08.184
I'll make something.

22:14.660 --> 22:17.390
PHILIP: (Amplified voice)
Travel agent is pretty much

22:17.430 --> 22:19.193
the only job I've ever known.

22:19.230 --> 22:20.993
Uh, it -- it suited me.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.463
I-I like to travel,
see new places

22:23.510 --> 22:27.628
and...meet new people.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.877
But, I mean, you choose a job

22:30.910 --> 22:34.073
before you really know
if you'll like it, right?

22:34.120 --> 22:39.148
I mean, when you're young,
you don't...know anything --

22:39.190 --> 22:43.149
who you are,
what you wanna do, be.

22:43.190 --> 22:47.081
You pick something because
it fits what you like,

22:47.130 --> 22:50.099
what -- what you need.

22:50.130 --> 22:55.989
But life changes things,
you change, or -- or something.

22:56.040 --> 22:59.362
And then one day you wake up,

22:59.410 --> 23:02.106
and you don't want to go
into the office.

23:02.140 --> 23:04.938
You don't wanna make
arrangements for people

23:04.980 --> 23:08.518
you don't know
and don't give a shit about.

23:08.550 --> 23:09.949
You...

23:11.790 --> 23:14.918
You don't wanna do it.

23:14.960 --> 23:17.952
You just don't.

23:20.760 --> 23:26.369
Every morning, I wake up
with this sick feeling

23:26.400 --> 23:28.766
in the pit of my stomach.

23:36.780 --> 23:39.146
Okay.

23:39.180 --> 23:42.911
So...why don't you quit,
find a new job?

23:45.290 --> 23:47.656
I can't.

23:47.690 --> 23:49.612
Why not?

23:51.260 --> 23:55.549
Because I have commitments.
I've made promises.

23:55.600 --> 23:56.828
To who?

23:56.860 --> 23:59.169
To...

23:59.200 --> 24:03.068
people who trust me
and people I love.

24:03.100 --> 24:04.965
And you don't wanna
let them down?

24:05.010 --> 24:06.602
No.

24:06.640 --> 24:09.609
But it's okay to let
yourself down?

24:09.640 --> 24:14.714
Do you think your family would
no longer love you if you quit?

24:16.280 --> 24:20.080
Do you think the world would
stop spinning?

24:20.120 --> 24:22.987
'Cause I got news for you.

24:23.020 --> 24:24.624
You ain't that important.

24:43.180 --> 24:45.045
It was
two different intercepts,

24:45.080 --> 24:48.140
and he doesn't show up at
your meeting or your alternate.

24:48.180 --> 24:51.946
I've called him three times.
They've got him.

24:51.990 --> 24:55.050
The question now is William.

24:55.090 --> 24:58.856
It's not like he was so happy
to do this in the first place.

24:58.890 --> 25:02.326
No.
I'm not saying he walked it
over to them.

25:02.360 --> 25:04.021
But now that they have him,

25:04.070 --> 25:06.766
they probably have something
enticing to offer.

25:10.100 --> 25:12.068
You spent more time with him
than I did.

25:16.180 --> 25:19.069
I hadn't thought about him
like that.

25:19.110 --> 25:25.185
I mean, he bitched and moaned
and was...an asshole.

25:28.720 --> 25:30.722
I guess it's possible.

25:30.760 --> 25:33.729
He's been here.
We better go.

25:55.820 --> 25:57.219
(door creaks)

25:58.990 --> 26:01.254
(buzzing)

26:02.620 --> 26:06.021
(sighs and sniffles)

26:06.060 --> 26:07.220
(door opens)

26:07.260 --> 26:09.558
(door creaks)

26:09.600 --> 26:11.067
Mischa.

26:11.100 --> 26:14.592
(indistinct conversations)

26:21.140 --> 26:24.143
(baby crying in distance)

26:38.090 --> 26:41.093
(indistinct conversations)

27:08.860 --> 27:10.157
(exhales deeply)

30:28.420 --> 30:30.559
To what
do I owe this pleasure?

30:30.590 --> 30:34.822
We recently arrested a man
named William Crandall.

30:34.860 --> 30:36.191
He was a scientist working
atalab

30:36.230 --> 30:39.495
called Foster Medical Research,
but in fact,

30:39.530 --> 30:43.660
he was_ a member of Directorate S
spying for your government,

30:43.700 --> 30:45.031
stealing secrets to be used

30:45.070 --> 30:47.334
in your nation's
biological weapons program.

30:47.370 --> 30:51.545
That's...very surprising.

30:51.580 --> 30:53.343
To my knowledge,
my country doesn't have

30:53.380 --> 30:56.679
a biological weapons program.

30:56.720 --> 31:01.350
In fact, it is my understanding,
according to the treaties,

31:01.390 --> 31:04.689
yours doesn't have one
either.

31:04.730 --> 31:06.322
So it would be shocking
to discover

31:06.360 --> 31:08.055
that you're working
on such a --

31:08.100 --> 31:09.852
We only work on research
to create antidotes

31:09.900 --> 31:12.095
and medicines for the weapons
we know you're making.

31:12.130 --> 31:14.928
You should really make these
baseless accusations

31:14.970 --> 31:16.437
to the Ambassador.

31:16.470 --> 31:20.065
I'm just Cultural Attach,
as you know.

31:20.110 --> 31:22.237
We know exactly who you are,
and we will be speaking

31:22.280 --> 31:23.907
to the Ambassador directly,

31:23.950 --> 31:26.441
_ as well as to
the Foreign Minister in Moscow.

31:26.480 --> 31:28.243
President Reagan expects
your country

31:28.280 --> 31:30.669
to keep to the treaties
it signed.

31:30.720 --> 31:32.244
And he will be bringing
this incident up

31:32.290 --> 31:34.110
with Andropov shortly.

31:44.600 --> 31:46.192
You've gone too far.

31:46.230 --> 31:48.767
Bugging
my predecessor's office,

31:48.800 --> 31:51.530
having one of your officers
marry his secretary,

31:51.570 --> 31:55.131
which is the lowest thing I have
seen in my entire life.

31:55.180 --> 31:59.139
And now this -- you're being
expelled from the country.

31:59.180 --> 32:01.944
You have no proof.
You killed Frank Gaad.

32:01.980 --> 32:04.414
Agent Wolfe --
I don't care.

32:04.450 --> 32:06.179
I wanna see his face.

32:11.160 --> 32:13.822
You've got 48 hours
to get out.

32:27.980 --> 32:29.129
(monitor beeping steadily)

32:29.180 --> 32:31.671
ADERHOLT;
Are you in pain?

32:34.180 --> 32:36.319
The strain I gave myself

32:36.350 --> 32:41.287
gets to the hemorrhagic
fever stage pretty quickly.

32:42.960 --> 32:45.827
Anyone you'd like us to contact,
Mr. Crandall?

32:45.860 --> 32:50.024
(breathing unevenly)
Agent Aderholt --

32:50.060 --> 32:53.826
STAN: We have channels
we can use.

32:53.870 --> 32:55.030
No doubt.

32:57.040 --> 33:00.032
After so many years
in your country

33:00.070 --> 33:05.679
as your unwelcomed guest,
there is no one.

33:05.710 --> 33:10.477
Besides, anyone who needs
to know, knows.

33:13.550 --> 33:18.328
They don't know if you've
told us anything.

33:19.890 --> 33:23.656
No. They don't know that.

33:34.440 --> 33:37.329
Did you like it --
what you did?

33:39.950 --> 33:42.748
It was exciting at first.

33:42.780 --> 33:47.183
(gasps) Like all new things.

33:47.220 --> 33:50.917
Auspicious beginnings
and all that.

33:50.960 --> 33:53.087
I was committed to something.

33:53.130 --> 33:56.691
(breathing unevenly)

33:56.730 --> 34:00.689
And I was...invisible.

34:00.730 --> 34:03.096
To us?
(grunts)

34:03.140 --> 34:05.904
T-To everyone. (chuckles)

34:05.940 --> 34:09.376
(chuckles)
Made me feel special,

34:09.410 --> 34:13.949
_ like I was the star_
in my very own mowe.

34:13.980 --> 34:18.189
Then...over time,

34:18.220 --> 34:22.953
the thing that made it special,
made me special,

34:22.990 --> 34:26.926
my secret power, as it were...

34:26.960 --> 34:30.191
(breathing unevenly)

34:30.230 --> 34:33.199
...became a curse.

34:33.230 --> 34:37.291
I was alone, isolated.

34:37.340 --> 34:40.559
Lonely. Very lonely.

34:40.610 --> 34:44.148
I'd reach out to people.
(breathing unevenly)

34:44.180 --> 34:48.139
Not friends, exactly.

34:48.180 --> 34:52.446
Maybe acquaintances,
more like.

34:52.490 --> 34:57.154
But there was always...

34:57.190 --> 34:58.657
a distance.

34:58.690 --> 35:03.195
A...a barrier.

35:12.010 --> 35:17.038
The absence of closeness
makes you...

35:19.610 --> 35:22.170
...dry inside.

35:27.850 --> 35:30.387
But still committed.

35:33.890 --> 35:36.199
It was the only thing
I had left.

35:44.310 --> 35:47.336
(monitors continue beeping)

35:55.380 --> 35:58.884
Anything new?
No.

35:58.920 --> 36:01.480
Butthelonger
they have William in custody,

36:01.520 --> 36:05.729
the greater the risk
to you.

36:05.760 --> 36:09.218
It's been a hard year.
Yeah.

36:09.260 --> 36:12.491
The problems pile up.

36:12.530 --> 36:16.159
It's hard to know
when it's too late.

36:16.200 --> 36:18.907
If William
talks to the FBI,

36:18.940 --> 36:21.977
risks on top of risks,

36:22.010 --> 36:24.501
when do we stop?

36:24.550 --> 36:27.371
I think you two and your
children should return home.

36:30.720 --> 36:33.689
What?

36:33.720 --> 36:37.884
Philip, your heart hasn't been
in this for a long time.

36:37.920 --> 36:42.198
Elizabeth, you've been doing
this for almost 20 years.

36:42.230 --> 36:44.425
The job wasn't
meant to be forever.

36:47.800 --> 36:53.158
So what, the Centre wants us
to pack our bags and come home?

36:53.210 --> 36:54.939
You've had
a good, long tour.

36:54.980 --> 36:57.175
The Centre would welcome you
with honors

36:57.210 --> 36:59.178
the moment you tell them
you're ready.

36:59.210 --> 37:04.170
But with William under arrest,
you're in immediate danger.

37:04.220 --> 37:06.017
I know.

37:06.050 --> 37:08.211
I know you've always been
in danger,

37:08.260 --> 37:11.752
but that can dull
the senses.

37:11.790 --> 37:14.054
I think it's time.

37:14.090 --> 37:17.548
I want you to go home
and get your kids.

37:17.600 --> 37:20.068
And get yourselves
to a safe house.

37:22.100 --> 37:23.965
But, of course,
it's your decision.

37:24.000 --> 37:27.003
(Leonard Cohen's "Who By Fire"
Playing)

37:32.980 --> 37:34.379

37:34.420 --> 37:36.570
LEONARD COHEN:

37:36.620 --> 37:39.088
Hi, Claire.

Wanna hold her?

Okay, Claire, meet Paige.

37:50.700 --> 37:54.124

38:08.450 --> 38:13.444

* Who by barbiturate

38:22.860 --> 38:25.260
* Who in these realms of love

Hi. I'm Paige.

38:45.720 --> 38:49.053
* Who shall I say

38:49.090 --> 38:55.029
(engine starts)

38:57.230 --> 39:01.018
* And who by brave assent

39:01.070 --> 39:04.403
* Who by accident

39:04.440 --> 39:07.898

39:07.940 --> 39:11.649

* Is calling

William?

(breathing heavily)

42:29.380 --> 42:31.177
They...

42:31.210 --> 42:33.269
They want...

42:33.310 --> 42:36.711
always wanted more.

42:40.050 --> 42:44.180
More information.

42:44.220 --> 42:46.222
More samples.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.218
They wanted me married.

43:01.070 --> 43:02.970
I tried.

43:03.010 --> 43:05.774
We were fighting.

43:05.810 --> 43:06.970
I was...

43:13.350 --> 43:15.989
I wish...
I could've been with her

43:16.020 --> 43:17.783
for all these years.

43:21.460 --> 43:22.996
Like them.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.262
Couple kids.

43:31.000 --> 43:32.433
American dream.

43:37.140 --> 43:39.449
Never suspect them.

43:45.850 --> 43:48.614
She's...

43:48.660 --> 43:50.059
pretty.

43:56.230 --> 43:58.027
He's luclq.

44:16.350 --> 44:19.342
(whirring)

44:26.860 --> 44:29.397
When we had the interception,
we really dug a grave
for ourselves.

44:29.430 --> 44:31.398
And it's like the old saying --
if you make the bed hard,

44:31.430 --> 44:32.829
you gotta lay in it.
(door opens)

44:32.870 --> 44:36.237
Hey.
Hey, Mom, Dad.

44:36.270 --> 44:38.488
Thanks for watching
the Super Bowl with me.

44:38.540 --> 44:42.078
I-I'm sorry. We -- we got
caught up with work.

44:42.110 --> 44:43.509
What -- what happened?

44:43.540 --> 44:47.806
We lost by a lot.
It sucked.

44:47.850 --> 44:50.546
MAN: ...pins the Redskins back
at their own 12-yard line
with only...

44:50.580 --> 44:52.309
I'll be down
in a few minutes, okay?

44:52.350 --> 44:55.080
Raiders defensive coach
Charlie...

44:55.120 --> 44:57.759
MAN: This particular play, uh,
Joe Washington swings out.

44:57.790 --> 44:59.826
He gets grabbed a little bit
by Lyle.

44:59.860 --> 45:01.487
I tried to get it
over Lyle's head,

45:01.530 --> 45:03.350
and I never saw _
the linebacker coming in.

45:03.400 --> 45:05.095
(crunching)
I anticipated them being
in a zone— --

45:05.130 --> 45:06.563
a zone defense.
As it turns out...

45:06.600 --> 45:09.262
You're not that into sports,
are you?

45:09.300 --> 45:11.063
(mouth full)
When I was little, I was. Um...

45:11.100 --> 45:12.362
(clears throat)

45:12.410 --> 45:16.107
My dad and I played
a lot of football.

45:16.140 --> 45:19.906
But now, uh...

45:19.950 --> 45:22.271
What?
Yeah, I don't know.

45:22.320 --> 45:24.208
Just the whole thing
with my dad.

45:26.750 --> 45:29.116
What?

45:29.160 --> 45:32.084
He cheated on my mom.
Did you know that?

45:32.130 --> 45:35.293
I heard 'em
talking about it.

45:35.330 --> 45:38.788
You know what's gross?
My friend at school was like,

45:38.830 --> 45:40.263
"What? I would never cheat
on your mom."

45:40.300 --> 45:43.599
(sighs)
People are stupid.

45:43.640 --> 45:45.767
Yeah.

45:45.810 --> 45:47.107
(sighs)

45:49.080 --> 45:52.948
But...in a way it's...good,
right?

45:52.980 --> 45:54.572
Seeing them as people.

45:54.610 --> 45:58.444
I guess.
But they're still my parents.

45:58.480 --> 46:01.608
No, 1-1 know. Believe me.

46:02.990 --> 46:04.787
(exhales deeply)

46:04.830 --> 46:06.889
Sometimes don't you
just wish

46:06.930 --> 46:10.024
you could go back to being
a little kid again?

46:11.100 --> 46:13.989
I don't know.

46:14.030 --> 46:17.966
(man speaking indistinctly
over TV)

46:18.000 --> 46:22.175
I used to think my dad was
having an affair at work.

46:22.210 --> 46:24.599
Really?

46:24.640 --> 46:27.006
Yeah. He was working late
a lot,

46:27.050 --> 46:28.972
and it happened to my friend

46:29.020 --> 46:33.411
with her dad
and his secretary.

46:33.450 --> 46:35.179
I asked my mom about it.

46:35.220 --> 46:37.017
Really?
Yeah.

46:37.060 --> 46:38.516
What'd she say?

46:38.560 --> 46:41.154
She said no.
She trusted him.

46:43.700 --> 46:46.965
But I don't know
how you know.

46:47.000 --> 46:48.092
Like what we were saying --

46:48.130 --> 46:53.705
they're just people,
and people...

46:53.740 --> 46:55.674
Shit happens, you know?

46:55.710 --> 46:58.907
(man continues indistinctly
over TV)

47:05.350 --> 47:09.889
...sacking him six times
and forced three turnovers.

47:09.920 --> 47:11.057
The cornerbacks
for the Raiders,

47:11.090 --> 47:13.126
Lester Hayes and Mike Haynes,

47:13.160 --> 47:16.220
_frustrat_ed the Redskins
Wide receivers all game long

47:16.260 --> 47:18.694
with their physical
bump and run coverage.

47:18.730 --> 47:21.858
MAN: I guess a lot of people
is gonna think like that,

47:21.900 --> 47:24.698
but if you can really view
the film, you know,

47:24.740 --> 47:27.038
any football expert,
you would see that, you know,

47:27.070 --> 47:28.503
I was open the entire game.

47:31.240 --> 47:32.548
(sighs)

47:39.420 --> 47:42.389
(bed creaks)
(sighs)

47:42.420 --> 47:44.012
You wanna pack?

47:44.060 --> 47:46.255
Get the hell out of here?

47:50.130 --> 47:51.552
Maybe.

47:53.630 --> 47:54.961
I don't know.

47:58.200 --> 48:00.100
You trying to picture
them there?

48:00.140 --> 48:01.971
(whispers) Yeah.

48:04.240 --> 48:07.368
(car door opens and closes
in distance)

48:15.390 --> 48:17.858
Stan's home.

48:17.890 --> 48:20.188
Hasn't been watching
the Super Bowl.

48:20.230 --> 48:22.391
Work must be busy.

48:24.060 --> 48:26.893
At least he doesn't have
five FBI cars behind him.

48:28.130 --> 48:29.961
So that's a good thing.

48:30.000 --> 48:31.638
Yeah.

48:35.140 --> 48:38.598
You should go get Paige.

48:38.640 --> 48:40.301
(whispers) Yeah.

48:40.350 --> 48:43.342
**

49:09.380 --> 49:10.836
Hi.
Hey, hey.

49:13.180 --> 49:14.772
(whispers) Shh.

49:20.450 --> 49:24.159
(lowered voice)
So I just got home.

49:24.190 --> 49:25.828
Matthew and Paige --

49:25.860 --> 49:29.591
I don't think they were
just watching football.

49:29.630 --> 49:33.418
(whispers) What?
I don't know. It was --
It was all like...

49:33.470 --> 49:34.960
You know. (clears throat)
Oh...

49:35.000 --> 49:36.797
When I came in.
Right.

49:39.170 --> 49:41.832
Father of the bride,
you're paying.

49:41.870 --> 49:43.633
You can use my backyard
if you want to.

49:43.680 --> 49:47.207
Yeah, good.
(whispers) All right, come on.

49:47.250 --> 49:50.708
MAN ON TV: ...came into
this game expecting to win...

49:50.750 --> 49:52.638
Hey.

49:52.690 --> 49:55.853
Hi, Dad.
Hey, Mr. Jennings.

49:55.890 --> 49:58.484
See you got all
your Super Bowl snacks there.

49:58.520 --> 50:00.886
How was the game?
Heard we lost.

50:00.930 --> 50:03.194
Uh, yeah, it was
a total blowout.

50:03.230 --> 50:06.825
Oh...

50:06.870 --> 50:08.189
Okay, let's go, sweetie.

50:08.230 --> 50:10.391
What?
It's getting late.

50:10.440 --> 50:13.307
(TV continues indistinctly)

50:13.340 --> 50:15.672
Bye.
See ya.

50:15.710 --> 50:17.632
Bye, Mr. Beeman.
Bye, Paige.

50:17.680 --> 50:19.898
Hey, uh, racquetball Tuesday?
You bet.

50:19.950 --> 50:21.099
STAN: Okay.

50:25.120 --> 50:26.417
(door opens)

50:26.450 --> 50:29.453
**

50:42.370 --> 50:44.691
I don't want you
to see him.

50:44.740 --> 50:47.504
That's ridiculous.

50:47.540 --> 50:49.735
Don't do this, Paige.

50:49.780 --> 50:51.179
Dad.

50:51.210 --> 50:54.543
You have no idea.

50:54.580 --> 50:56.013
No idea.

50:56.050 --> 50:59.042
**

52:18.460 --> 52:20.098
Here's to Gigi

52:20.130 --> 52:22.018
-and our dysfunctional--
-(blows raspberry)

52:22.070 --> 52:23.628
rock and roll family.

52:23.670 --> 52:25.308
Cheers.
Whoo-hoo!

52:25.340 --> 52:27.968
You are not lousy in bed.
You just need a little help.

52:28.010 --> 52:29.534
-(grunting)
-What does that mean?

52:30.840 --> 52:34.207
I'm gonna get famous
for being her songwriting dad.

52:34.250 --> 52:36.013
-Just be worrying
about your piano chops.
-(piano: discordant)

52:36.050 --> 52:38.177
-What's wrong
with my Piano ChOPS?
_* (simplistic chords)

52:38.220 --> 52:40.313
(retching)

52:40.350 --> 52:41.510
Nothing.
Nothing.

52:43.020 --> 52:44.658

52:50.000 --> 52:52.218
(wind gusting)

53:20.460 --> 53:23.520
EPHRAIM: It's been 23 days
since the nightmare began.

53:24.900 --> 53:26.367
Why do we fight?

53:28.070 --> 53:30.459
-Revenge.
-(woman screams)
