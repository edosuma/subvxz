02:45.700 --> 02:47.020
- Nathan?
- Talk to me.

02:47.100 --> 02:49.660
Yes, tonight. Sternwood is doing it tonight.

02:49.780 --> 02:51.940
Jesus, Max, you might finally
have got him. Where?

02:51.940 --> 02:52.780
Aberdeen square.

02:52.780 --> 02:54.500
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

02:54.500 --> 02:55.660
Yeah, I'm positive.

04:33.620 --> 04:34.820
Fuck!

04:42.900 --> 04:44.020
Lewinsky?

05:31.260 --> 05:34.060
Max, Sternwood is highly
dangerous. You're obsessed!

05:34.060 --> 05:35.260
You're not thinking straight!

05:42.900 --> 05:46.100
Listen to me. Backup is on
its way. Don't go in unarmed.

05:46.300 --> 05:49.820
Repeat: Do not go in unarmed.
That is an order!

07:44.620 --> 07:45.940
Newspaper, Sir?

07:52.060 --> 07:53.780
Sir? Thank you, Sir.

07:57.020 --> 07:58.700
Newspaper?

08:11.060 --> 08:11.940
- Paper, sir?
- No.

08:11.940 --> 08:13.180
Thank you, Sir.

08:30.540 --> 08:34.100
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Joanna
McCauley and I'm your chief flight attendant.

08:34.179 --> 08:37.220
On behalf of captain Hanna and
the entire crew, welcome aboard...

08:37.220 --> 08:39.539
...this non-stop flight from
London to Reykjavik.

08:39.820 --> 08:42.900
Our flight time will be approximately
two hours and 35 minutes.

08:42.900 --> 08:47.660
We'll be flying at an altitude of 32,000 feet
and a ground speed of 500 miles per hour.

08:47.700 --> 08:49.740
Sir, sir, the seat belt sign is-

08:49.740 --> 08:52.300
- Sir!
- Get out of the way!

09:04.940 --> 09:07.380
- Dad?
- Ruan?

09:07.660 --> 09:09.580
I'm so sorry, dad.

09:09.580 --> 09:10.980
I wouldn't have made it.

09:11.180 --> 09:13.860
- Made it back?
- I fucked up.

09:14.620 --> 09:15.900
What do you mean?
What's wrong?

09:15.900 --> 09:18.540
I fucked up. I have to go
back to the Greigo Mar.

09:18.620 --> 09:20.220
Greigo Mar, what's that?

09:20.220 --> 09:21.500
Stay where you are!

09:21.500 --> 09:22.620
Look, if you're in some kind of trouble,

09:22.620 --> 09:23.940
- I can have somebody-
- Dad, I'm scared.

09:24.060 --> 09:26.300
Lie down on the floor!

09:26.660 --> 09:27.900
Ruan, where are you?

09:28.300 --> 09:30.220
- Dad-
- Ruan!

09:46.060 --> 09:48.500
Gun crime is an election issue
this morning.

09:48.860 --> 09:50.700
After last night's shooting of
two young men,

09:50.780 --> 09:52.860
Robert Wiseman, the shadow home secretary...

09:52.860 --> 09:55.860
...has again called for the police
force to be fully armed.

10:44.900 --> 10:46.260
Max!

11:02.380 --> 11:03.700
We're late.

11:06.580 --> 11:08.140
Again.

11:27.580 --> 11:28.460
Wow.

11:30.180 --> 11:32.420
Place is looking
really homely, Max...

11:58.140 --> 11:59.500
So, Mr. Warns,

12:00.300 --> 12:02.300
...escorting convoys and guarding v. I.P.S...

12:02.300 --> 12:05.220
...your days have got to be pretty
regimented, haven't they?

12:09.540 --> 12:11.020
Something funny?

12:12.940 --> 12:14.140
I'm wise to you.

12:15.420 --> 12:17.860
- Yeah? - I can see the path
that you're on.

12:18.340 --> 12:20.220
It's like I'm looking at a grid zone.

12:21.260 --> 12:23.100
All rolled out in little coordinates.

12:23.460 --> 12:25.500
And I'm tracking exactly where
you're going with it.

12:26.940 --> 12:29.420
I reel off my old routine.

12:29.820 --> 12:32.220
...like the brainwashed robot
that you think I am.

12:33.260 --> 12:35.460
And then you tell me how
unfortunate it is that...

12:35.460 --> 12:36.940
...someone with my conditioning
doesn't know...

12:36.980 --> 12:39.180
.. his exact movements
on Saturday night.

12:39.900 --> 12:43.860
Well, the security guard patrolling the
container yard, said he saw you...

12:44.540 --> 12:50.060
...and a kid fitting the description of Otis
Blake, the night he was murdered.

12:50.460 --> 12:52.340
That's unfortunate.

12:53.380 --> 12:54.940
In fact, he took down
your number plate.

12:54.940 --> 12:56.420
Means you're fucked.

13:01.820 --> 13:04.380
I wanna told them
and now I'm telling you...

13:05.460 --> 13:08.220
- I was with my grandmother.
- Doing what?

13:09.500 --> 13:11.860
- I was watching a film.
- What film?

13:12.380 --> 13:13.820
Calamity Jane.

13:23.700 --> 13:26.500
- It is a classic.
- How's that film end again?

13:30.820 --> 13:33.220
They ride off into the
fucking sunset.

13:34.860 --> 13:36.100
Prick.

13:46.540 --> 13:48.060
- All right, max?
- All right, mate?

13:48.060 --> 13:49.540
They wanna see you.

13:52.900 --> 13:56.780
- Max.
- Nathan. Sir.

13:56.780 --> 13:57.740
We all good?

14:00.620 --> 14:02.820
We're letting warns go.

14:02.860 --> 14:05.460
The security guard who identified him
at the container yard.

14:06.340 --> 14:09.660
He's retracted his statement.
Says he made a mistake.

14:09.660 --> 14:12.620
Warns' grandmother backs up his
alibi, says she was with him all night.

14:12.620 --> 14:15.500
- Watched a film Calamity Jane.
- This is bullshit.

14:15.500 --> 14:19.900
I need this arrest more than anyone, but
without hard evidence, he walks, all right?

14:19.900 --> 14:23.540
- So what, nothing turn up at the container yard?
- Team swept every dock.

14:23.540 --> 14:24.500
Found nothing.

14:24.500 --> 14:26.420
You know why he was thrown
out of the army, Nathan?

14:26.820 --> 14:28.620
- He resigned.
- He was guilty.

14:28.620 --> 14:32.660
He witness has retracted. The container
yard is clean and Warns' alibi is solid.

14:32.660 --> 14:34.580
The decision's already
been made, OK?

14:34.580 --> 14:38.140
- Well, the decision's bad.
- And so's your attitude.

14:39.100 --> 14:41.980
Oi, why don't you go and
wait inside, yeah?

14:43.900 --> 14:45.140
Go on.

14:52.180 --> 14:53.420
She's good at her job, you know.

14:53.900 --> 14:57.980
No, I like her. She's got the
same fire that you used to have.

15:07.060 --> 15:09.380
- How can you do that?
- What?

15:09.580 --> 15:11.820
How can you just stand there
and not even argue your point?

15:11.820 --> 15:13.220
If I had a point, I'd argue it.

15:14.780 --> 15:16.980
When I asked to work with you, Max,
I thought you'd at least have my back.

15:16.980 --> 15:20.380
Yeah, look... Look, I've just
learned not to get involved, all right?

15:20.780 --> 15:22.860
You've just learned to take it up
the ass from Geiger.

15:24.900 --> 15:26.860
Human emotion, my god.

15:30.660 --> 15:34.100
- You want to get yourself a notebook.
- You worried I might get ink poisoning, aren't you?

15:34.100 --> 15:37.260
- It's already infected your tongue.
- At least my ass is still intact.

16:13.900 --> 16:15.260
Juka, what's that about?

16:20.340 --> 16:22.980
Young guy traveling under
the passport of William Morgan.

16:22.980 --> 16:25.660
Collapses on the runway
at city airport.

16:25.660 --> 16:29.060
Turns out the real Morgan died five years
ago in a car crash in Dudlowe, Essex.

16:29.060 --> 16:30.820
- So what?
- So they check his fingerprints.

16:31.020 --> 16:33.900
Turns out that he was arrested
as a kid for shoplifting.

16:33.900 --> 16:35.900
Juka, come on, man,
my toast is getting cold.

16:36.380 --> 16:38.700
It's Ruan Sternwood.

16:59.340 --> 17:03.300
All right, I'm being asked a lot of the same questions,
so grab pens 'cause I'm not repeating it.

17:08.380 --> 17:10.099
Last night, Jacob Sternwood's son...

17:10.220 --> 17:14.619
Ruan Sternwood was picked up at city airport
suffering from a gunshot wound to the stomach.

17:14.900 --> 17:18.740
Ballistics show he was shot by
the same gun as Otis Blake, but this...

17:20.099 --> 17:21.700
...this is the icing.

17:22.660 --> 17:27.940
Before Ruan collapsed, he made a call from
a mobile to a landline in Hella, Iceland.

17:29.300 --> 17:34.340
Right now, an s. F.O. Unit is making its way to a remote
address 94 kilometers east of Reykjavik.

17:34.860 --> 17:38.060
They'll make entry at approximately
2200 hours...

17:38.100 --> 17:40.420
...and they've been instructed
to shoot to disable.

17:40.420 --> 17:41.260
- It won't work.
- Why?

17:41.260 --> 17:43.340
Because it won't.
They need to hold off.

17:44.820 --> 17:46.980
Or let Sternwood think
we haven't clocked on.

17:46.980 --> 17:49.420
Surround the house, take him when he
moves, that's when he's vulnerable.

17:49.460 --> 17:50.580
Max!

17:50.740 --> 17:52.420
- Say something then.
- No.

17:52.620 --> 17:53.860
Something you want to add, mate?

17:55.780 --> 17:59.380
No. No.

18:02.540 --> 18:04.180
It won't work.

18:09.300 --> 18:10.660
Uh, all right, um...

18:11.540 --> 18:13.820
Well, what do you think will work...

18:14.660 --> 18:15.460
...Sarah?

18:19.300 --> 18:21.820
Well... Nathan...

18:22.380 --> 18:24.140
You've gotta...

18:26.180 --> 18:29.940
Hold off, wait,

18:31.220 --> 18:32.660
Surround the house and...

18:35.420 --> 18:37.220
Take him when he's least expecting it.

18:37.220 --> 18:38.820
And if I tell them to hold off...

18:38.820 --> 18:42.340
...and we turn up and find out
that he's got away- again-

18:42.660 --> 18:44.980
Who's gonna take the flak? You had no
problem pointing the finger last time.

18:44.980 --> 18:47.340
You disobeyed orders, you paid the price.

18:49.940 --> 18:53.460
If you're such an expert, mMax, why's he still
at large and why is you not standing up here?

18:53.460 --> 18:55.660
I don't give a fuck about any of that stuff.

18:59.620 --> 19:02.020
- Do you know what, mate?
- It's your call.

19:02.020 --> 19:03.900
Yeah, it is and it's done.

21:02.340 --> 21:06.100
Max, this is gonna be hard.
Try not to act too smug.

21:06.740 --> 21:09.020
Innocent people were killed last
night. I'm not smug about anything.

21:09.020 --> 21:10.060
You know what I mean.

21:11.900 --> 21:15.580
Oh, for god's sake, I'm Robert
Wiseman's campaign manager. Max...

21:16.420 --> 21:19.460
Tell him who I am. / What? No, I've
never seen her before in my life.

21:19.580 --> 21:24.300
And we're trying to establish whether
there's a link between the two cases.

21:24.780 --> 21:26.540
Right, I'll take any questions you might have.

21:26.980 --> 21:30.540
That's two people in a related shooting
and not a single lead to show for it.

21:30.540 --> 21:31.860
As I said, we're on top of it.

21:32.140 --> 21:35.140
I'm confident it will be
resolved quickly and efficiently.

21:35.140 --> 21:36.100
Thanks.

21:36.100 --> 21:39.180
How do you react to the shadow home
secretary's claims that we're suffering twice...

21:39.180 --> 21:41.540
...the level of violent crime
committed in the United States?

21:41.540 --> 21:44.420
Well, I'm not gonna get
involved in an election campaign.

21:45.180 --> 21:51.020
Suffice to say, whoever takes office on the 21st needs
to ensure the police have all the resources they need...

21:51.020 --> 21:54.820
...to carry out their job. \You think what happened
to Sternwood's son will draw him out?

21:56.020 --> 21:58.100
I was shot in the leg, Jane, not in the head.

21:59.220 --> 22:00.620
Don't I know it.

22:00.620 --> 22:02.340
Arm transport police with tasers.

22:02.340 --> 22:05.420
Increasing the number of officers
qualified to utilize firearms.

22:05.740 --> 22:09.180
- Don't ask.
- Wasn't gonna.

22:09.180 --> 22:10.140
Next.

22:10.860 --> 22:14.700
Your own figures show a 17% increase
in gun crime in the last 12 months.

22:14.900 --> 22:17.460
I'm not gonna get into a debate
about statistics.

22:17.500 --> 22:22.140
If there's no more relevant questions,
I'll bid you all a good morning. Thank you.

22:24.620 --> 22:26.180
Tough questions.

22:27.060 --> 22:28.380
I've heard worse.

22:28.580 --> 22:30.300
You ducked them like a pro.

22:30.300 --> 22:32.180
I'd take that as a compliment...

22:32.220 --> 22:35.500
If you weren't the shadow
home secretary's campaign manager.

22:35.500 --> 22:38.580
We win this election and you'll get the
backing you need, but for now...

22:38.580 --> 22:40.020
...the questions are gonna get tougher.

22:40.020 --> 22:41.940
Well, I'm sure you'll spin it
to your own agenda.

22:42.780 --> 22:45.660
The kid at the airport, any
truth he's Jacob Sternwood's son?

22:49.700 --> 22:52.060
- Where did you get that?
- Come on.

22:52.460 --> 22:54.860
I ran your press for five years.

22:57.740 --> 22:59.020
Could be useful.

23:00.020 --> 23:02.420
- If it's handled well.
- Yeah.

23:10.020 --> 23:11.700
- See you, Jane.
- See you.

23:13.020 --> 23:15.100
I've got a meeting with the anti
- gun lobby, I've got two minutes.

23:15.180 --> 23:17.940
Max and I were just discussing
this Blake case and...

23:17.940 --> 23:21.860
We thought there may be a way through
Ruan Sternwood. Didn't we, max?

23:22.540 --> 23:25.540
Uh, yeah! Look, I don't know
about the Blake case, but...

23:26.500 --> 23:31.140
...if it was me, and it's not me, but if it was,
I'd put Ruan in an open hospital, public...

23:31.140 --> 23:34.100
...man it 'round the clock, dangle
the hooks, see if Sternwood bites, that's it.

23:35.100 --> 23:37.300
- You think you two are up to this?
- Yeah, of course we are.

23:38.060 --> 23:40.660
- Aren't we?
- Mm-hmm.

23:42.020 --> 23:46.580
- Max? He's still reeling from last time.
- He was bang on about Iceland, wasn't he?

23:46.580 --> 23:50.300
Look, um, I'm up to it, all right?

23:50.300 --> 23:54.340
You leave the Blake case to Nathan and
you stay out of his way, do you understand?

23:54.980 --> 23:58.700
I take your point. You get
the hospital, but that's all.

23:58.860 --> 24:00.980
- Thom, he's too close to it.
- Nathan, fuck off.

24:01.780 --> 24:04.340
I'm not too close,
I'm just over it.

24:04.500 --> 24:06.900
You won't have a problem then, will you?

24:15.580 --> 24:19.580
- Do you want me to start on row two?
- No, just start with the "a" class, son.

24:19.580 --> 24:20.540
Yes, boss.

24:29.220 --> 24:34.140
Jesus, jake. Why don't we just let
off some fireworks while we're at it?

24:34.180 --> 24:36.900
I wouldn't be here if I wasn't
a thousand percent, you know that.

24:40.780 --> 24:41.940
Come here.

24:47.500 --> 24:50.860
- Car was run of the mill?
- It was perfect.

24:51.860 --> 24:54.140
- Took a few knocks?
- I've had worse.

24:54.140 --> 24:55.820
So why did you level the house?

24:56.100 --> 24:58.660
Became just another
place to hide- I'd rather see it burn.

25:00.740 --> 25:04.860
If it's any consolation, you're looking good.

25:04.860 --> 25:07.060
- Great outdoors.
- Mm.

25:07.060 --> 25:07.860
What's that?

25:08.940 --> 25:10.460
Karen says I carry it off.

25:10.460 --> 25:13.100
Oh, does she now? Well,
you look like Kenny Rogers.

25:13.100 --> 25:16.420
Mmm, I can shave and you'll still
look like a bag of smashed crabs.

25:20.740 --> 25:22.140
How is he?

25:24.140 --> 25:25.820
They've taken him to st. Bart's.

25:27.020 --> 25:28.140
And?

25:29.100 --> 25:32.540
Apparently Ruan was involved
in some low-level stuff.

25:33.140 --> 25:34.660
Nothing serious.

25:34.940 --> 25:37.900
But he started hanging out with
a kid called Otis Blake.

25:38.060 --> 25:39.900
All mouth, no muscle.

25:40.380 --> 25:43.260
Ruan raised the cash, using the
family name as leverage.

25:43.620 --> 25:45.420
Otis did the deals.

25:48.220 --> 25:50.660
And that's where it
gets complicated.

25:51.180 --> 25:54.740
Four days ago, Otis was found floating
in the Thames with a bullet in his head.

25:55.380 --> 25:59.180
The next day, they pick up Ruan at city
airport suffering from a gunshot wound.

26:00.940 --> 26:02.500
They know who he is, Jake.

26:03.260 --> 26:04.940
They're going to make
an example of him...

26:05.060 --> 26:06.540
...because of us.

26:07.700 --> 26:08.820
Because of you.

26:14.540 --> 26:17.580
Eastover Air, Beaverbrook
Chartered, Conlin Museum,

26:17.740 --> 26:22.900
Sherriff Capital, Armourers Pacific, Elite
security, landed armored trucks twice.

26:23.540 --> 26:25.260
He's created a legend for
himself, I'll give him that.

26:25.300 --> 26:26.220
What?

26:31.580 --> 26:33.660
Man can kidnap, kill, rob...

26:33.980 --> 26:35.580
...hurt people.

26:36.900 --> 26:38.180
And he gets called a legend.

26:43.540 --> 26:46.380
Do well at school, Juka?
Get good marks and all that?

26:46.860 --> 26:48.340
- Hmm?
- Yes.

26:49.140 --> 26:52.700
So you work hard, you do your best.

26:53.220 --> 26:56.660
And I guarantee you'll get
remembered as a nobody.

26:57.940 --> 27:01.300
The only lasting thing about Jacob Sternwood
should be his fucking prison sentence.

27:26.300 --> 27:28.460
- Do you work here?
- What's that?

27:28.460 --> 27:30.980
Sorry, mate...
I'm looking for room 45.

27:32.220 --> 27:34.580
- Second door on the right.
- Nice one, cheers, mate.

27:43.500 --> 27:44.180
Get down!

27:47.380 --> 27:50.180
- Fuck are you doing here?
- I'm looking for room 45!

27:50.220 --> 27:51.700
All right, fuck that,
up you get, come on.

27:51.700 --> 27:53.500
- Who fucking sent you?
- No one sent me.

27:53.660 --> 27:54.540
You're lying to me already!

27:54.620 --> 27:56.740
- Max. Max!
- I fucking swear!

27:58.380 --> 28:00.620
- Can I ask you a few questions, sir?
- No, no, it's fine...

28:01.740 --> 28:04.580
Oi. Who told you that was room 45?

28:04.620 --> 28:08.220
What? I dunno, some tall geezer
in a baseball cap.

28:21.140 --> 28:22.340
Move, move!

28:24.300 --> 28:25.500
Get down!

28:32.900 --> 28:35.180
Max!

28:37.940 --> 28:39.540
Max!

28:48.900 --> 28:50.340
How is he?

28:51.420 --> 28:53.060
We're not gonna walk him
out of there.

28:54.420 --> 28:56.060
Lewinsky's all over him.

28:56.340 --> 29:00.140
I told you. You should have killed
that prick when you had the chance.

29:03.460 --> 29:06.500
- Do you know the Greigo Mar?
- Yeah, it's a...

29:06.900 --> 29:07.820
...a hotel.

29:07.900 --> 29:09.940
Ruan mentioned it the night he called.

29:12.860 --> 29:14.820
It was the last thing he said.

29:17.260 --> 29:18.620
Take me there.

29:22.980 --> 29:23.980
Sorry, excuse me.

29:24.060 --> 29:26.300
- Excuse me, what's going on?
- He's going into cardiac arrest.

29:26.340 --> 29:27.900
- What?
- Wait outside.

30:03.940 --> 30:05.740
No, if you let this out,
he'll disappear.

30:05.740 --> 30:08.700
Oi, you just stuck a gun
in a visitor's face.

30:08.700 --> 30:10.980
- They're trying to kick usout of here.
- All right, all right, look, look.

30:10.980 --> 30:15.380
Just, let me think. Just.. You keep
Sarah and I posted here, all right?

30:15.380 --> 30:17.180
We keep things ticking over.

30:17.180 --> 30:19.820
You release that Ruan's improved and
that's going to keep Sternwood in play.

30:19.820 --> 30:21.100
If he thinks he can walk his son out...

30:21.100 --> 30:23.100
...he's going to check the angles.

30:23.900 --> 30:26.940
Thom. Look, at the very least,

30:26.940 --> 30:29.020
It's gonna keep the press off your
back for a couple of more days.

30:34.020 --> 30:35.460
All right, you stay here.

30:36.820 --> 30:38.460
Got it all figured out, haven't you?

30:44.220 --> 30:46.340
He would have checked in
under his mother's name.

30:48.700 --> 30:50.300
Welcome to Hotel Greigo Mar.

32:26.100 --> 32:28.100
Roy, bring me that penknife.

33:12.140 --> 33:13.140
What are you thinking?

33:16.820 --> 33:21.500
I'm thinking...
You put it out there...

33:21.740 --> 33:25.060
Ruan Sternwood was staying
at the Greigo Mar Hotel.

33:27.380 --> 33:29.500
And let's see what comes crawling in.

33:31.060 --> 33:32.300
Okay.

33:33.620 --> 33:36.420
- Can you hide that somewhere safe?
- Yeah.

33:37.460 --> 33:39.260
When you've done that...

33:39.420 --> 33:40.820
...go home, kiss your wife.

33:42.980 --> 33:44.860
Don't get involved in this mess.

33:46.340 --> 33:49.180
I was involved the second
they pulled the trigger.

34:00.340 --> 34:02.140
I take it we're not staying here.

34:03.060 --> 34:06.740
You are. I'm gonna go track down this security
guard, see if he's been squared off by Sternwood.

34:06.820 --> 34:08.620
What, you think he shot
his own son?

34:08.620 --> 34:10.540
No, no, I've think he's been
planning something.

34:10.580 --> 34:12.420
It fucked up and now
he's covering his tracks.

34:13.420 --> 34:15.100
Can you just take a step back
for a minute?

34:15.100 --> 34:16.179
What the fuck's that
supposed to mean?

34:16.179 --> 34:18.139
Meaning maybe it's not
all about Jacob Sternwood.

34:18.139 --> 34:18.980
What else is it about?

34:18.980 --> 34:21.300
Dean Warns for a start.
And a dead 22-year-old.

34:21.300 --> 34:23.179
Yeah, which all lead back
to Jacob Sternwood.

34:23.179 --> 34:25.340
- I've just got to figure out how.
- You?

34:25.739 --> 34:26.139
Right!

34:26.139 --> 34:28.780
You know what? Catching Sternwood
is not going to change the past.

34:28.780 --> 34:30.100
It has to!

34:32.940 --> 34:35.460
Or I'm always gonna be that nobody
that got shot in a tunnel...

34:35.500 --> 34:37.340
...and let him get away with it.

34:39.580 --> 34:41.020
- Listen!
- Don't.

34:41.020 --> 34:42.219
- Please..
- Don't.

34:42.500 --> 34:43.860
Listen to me!

34:45.420 --> 34:47.659
What went down in that tunnel...

34:48.780 --> 34:50.340
...does not make you a nobody.

34:52.620 --> 34:54.179
Hey, trust me.

34:56.260 --> 34:58.100
Concentrate on now.

35:01.660 --> 35:04.020
'Cause you're too good
at your job to waste it.

35:29.420 --> 35:31.660
You're still gonna have to
stay here and cover for me.

35:32.420 --> 35:34.380
Didn't anything I just said
make sense to you?

35:34.380 --> 35:36.100
I understood it,
just don't agree with it.

35:36.140 --> 35:38.580
- I'm coming with you.
- Sarah, I am not fucking asking!

35:39.220 --> 35:40.420
You're staying here.

35:45.500 --> 35:46.660
Fuck off.

35:50.620 --> 35:52.260
It's down to you,
whatever you want.

35:52.500 --> 35:53.740
I mean, you want it
new school or old school?

35:53.740 --> 35:59.060
We roll it new school, I'll get that shit
on facebook, twitter, BBM. Instant.

35:59.140 --> 36:02.220
That's the way the gospel's
usually nowadays, cyber-styley.

36:02.340 --> 36:05.540
We go old school, it's more orthodox
methods, people on the pavement.

36:05.820 --> 36:09.460
Bookies, dog tracks, runners,
bit of a nightmare, but I can do it.

36:09.460 --> 36:12.900
Or I can blitz it on both platforms,
but that's pretty much gonna be double.

36:14.500 --> 36:16.140
You want me to get rid of
this shit?

36:24.620 --> 36:28.660
Ruan Sternwood is staying at
the Greigo Mar Hotel...

36:28.660 --> 36:31.380
...room 1308.

36:32.220 --> 36:34.220
Just put that out there, okay?

36:39.700 --> 36:40.980
And Rob...

36:44.020 --> 36:45.580
You mess this one up.

36:46.540 --> 36:48.460
I'll show you
fucking old school.

38:02.420 --> 38:03.700
Joseph Ojogo?

38:04.900 --> 38:06.140
Right, wait there.

38:08.820 --> 38:11.740
Did you ever see or hear
a Jacob Sternwood at the container yard?

38:11.780 --> 38:12.980
- No.
- No?

38:13.220 --> 38:14.260
Do you never met him?

38:14.660 --> 38:16.220
Then what'd you retract your
statement for?

38:16.220 --> 38:18.980
You said you were positive you saw Dean Warns
with Otis Blake the night he was killed.

38:18.980 --> 38:19.780
What's changed?

38:20.100 --> 38:21.860
All you people look the same.

38:22.820 --> 38:25.220
Yeah, look at this.
Go on, look at it.

38:26.060 --> 38:29.260
He'll walk free, do it again,
and that'll be your fault.

38:31.780 --> 38:32.500
Look...

38:33.100 --> 38:34.980
...in Nigeria, this is reality.

38:35.060 --> 38:37.340
- No one gets justice.
- Yeah, and in this country...

38:37.380 --> 38:40.180
You'll go to prison for taking bribes
and pretending something didn't happen.

38:40.180 --> 38:42.180
- How's that?
- Please...

38:42.180 --> 38:44.420
I have a family to support, eh?

38:44.420 --> 38:46.780
A family who I hope to come and
live with me here in England.

38:46.780 --> 38:47.700
So what are you saying?

38:47.700 --> 38:50.780
I'm saying, I don't know
this Jacob Sternwood.

38:50.860 --> 38:53.500
I'm saying when I'm given
a new job..

38:53.500 --> 38:57.140
...with more money,
I don't argue.

39:04.020 --> 39:05.460
- What?
- This may be nothing...

39:05.460 --> 39:08.340
All the informants, all of them, called
within the space of half an hour...

39:08.340 --> 39:09.780
...of each other saying exactly the same thing.

39:10.060 --> 39:10.820
What thing?

39:10.900 --> 39:15.140
They've all heard that Ruan Sternwood is
apparently staying at the Greigo Mar Hotel...

39:15.300 --> 39:17.020
...room 1308.

39:59.620 --> 40:01.140
- Money's not here.
- Keep looking.

40:01.300 --> 40:04.500
Fuck you, Bartnick.
What do you think I'm doing?

40:15.940 --> 40:17.300
Bartnick!

40:39.700 --> 40:40.780
Harvey, go!

40:44.140 --> 40:45.300
Get out of there!

41:33.020 --> 41:34.500
Sternwood!

43:19.460 --> 43:21.540
- There you go.
- Thank you.

43:37.700 --> 43:38.820
Hi.

43:42.340 --> 43:44.460
- Sarah.
- Luke.

43:44.460 --> 43:45.900
- Luke?
- Yeah.

43:46.540 --> 43:47.860
Luke, um...

43:48.820 --> 43:50.380
I'm in a lot of trouble.

43:51.660 --> 43:54.460
And I was wondering if
you could help me.

43:55.020 --> 43:56.060
Yeah, yeah, what is it?

43:56.340 --> 43:58.980
Well, my company's lost this container.

44:00.060 --> 44:03.020
I was wondering if you
could help me find it.

44:03.420 --> 44:08.700
Yeah. Then I'm your logistician.

44:10.820 --> 44:13.220
Well, I was hoping you'd say that.

44:15.100 --> 44:19.380
- Um, what's the name of the company?
- S.C.I Haulage.

44:19.380 --> 44:20.340
Alright.

44:22.500 --> 44:26.660
Yeah, if you wanted, we could...
Um, find it together.

44:27.980 --> 44:34.060
But this is actually one of the largest
container yards in Europe.

45:44.020 --> 45:45.580
Max knows I'm here.

46:17.980 --> 46:19.420
Don't do this.

47:33.500 --> 47:35.780
This is Sarah Hawks,
leave a message.

47:36.220 --> 47:37.860
Sarah, it's Max, call me.

47:41.540 --> 47:43.660
Have you ever heard of
someone called Bartnick?

47:43.780 --> 47:45.620
- Who?
- Bartnick.

47:46.860 --> 47:47.820
Nope.

47:48.020 --> 47:50.180
These two guys, you know,
they scoped the room.

47:50.180 --> 47:53.500
The way they fired their guns,
it's like they were trained, you know?

47:55.340 --> 47:57.340
It was all too practiced.

47:59.260 --> 48:00.300
Hey, honey.

48:02.540 --> 48:04.260
Give me the keys, I want to open up.

48:07.180 --> 48:09.580
- Kids go off to school okay?
- Yeah, fine.

48:09.580 --> 48:11.660
- Hey, Karen.
- Fuck you, Jake.

48:12.380 --> 48:15.860
Roy, do you know what? I don't want this shit
in my life again. Do you understand me?

48:17.740 --> 48:20.740
If it was one of ours, this never
would have happened in the first place.

48:21.660 --> 48:25.060
I'm just hoping that this dead policeman
hasn't got anything to do with you.

48:28.180 --> 48:31.420
This government expects brave officers
like Harvey Crown...

48:31.500 --> 48:34.660
...to go into battle armed with
only a whistle and a baton.

48:34.740 --> 48:37.860
That guy's not dead two minutes, Jane. Already
you're going to use that for your campaign?

48:37.860 --> 48:39.460
This is for your benefit, Max.

48:39.460 --> 48:42.500
When he's Home Secretary, you're going to get
the proper tools you need to do your job.

48:42.540 --> 48:45.980
And half the people in this city won't be
shit-scared just to walk down the street.

48:46.020 --> 48:47.900
Of all people, I thought you'd
have believed in that.

48:47.900 --> 48:50.980
Jane, I'm paid to catch
crooks, not... get them elected.

48:53.060 --> 48:54.260
Thom?

48:55.940 --> 48:57.100
Gotta talk to you.

49:00.140 --> 49:02.580
I can't understand why an
officer from clubs and vice...

49:02.580 --> 49:05.260
...was found dead in Ruan's hotel room
with a gun in his hand.

49:05.260 --> 49:07.300
Yeah, I can't understand
what you were doing there.

49:07.300 --> 49:09.380
I told you the hospital was
yours and nothing else.

49:09.380 --> 49:11.500
- I had information, I acted on it.
- Well, so did Harvey Crown.

49:11.500 --> 49:13.460
Maybe he was checking out a lead
and needed protection.

49:13.460 --> 49:16.260
If it was just a routine check, if it was just
a couple of good old boys...

49:16.300 --> 49:17.980
...doing their duty, that's fine.

49:18.020 --> 49:21.740
But why two officers from separate divisions
twinning it? Why did one of them run?

49:22.180 --> 49:24.260
What do you mean two officers?

49:26.860 --> 49:30.340
Found that at the hotel.
Nathan's.

49:39.780 --> 49:42.260
- Did you know about it, Thom?
- Of course I didn't.

49:42.780 --> 49:44.180
I've got the press jumping all over me,

49:44.180 --> 49:46.940
I'm trying to run this division,
I don't need this shit as well, do I?

49:48.620 --> 49:51.100
Jacob Sternwood was there too.

49:54.340 --> 49:56.100
- Have you got evidence?
- He was there.

49:56.180 --> 49:57.900
Well, that's not good enough.

49:58.820 --> 50:00.540
You better get your facts straight.

50:02.980 --> 50:07.180
I'll look into Nathan and Crown and you focus
on Sternwood, okay, and you get back to me.

50:08.220 --> 50:10.020
Yeah.

50:13.820 --> 50:14.620
Max...

50:16.860 --> 50:18.620
It's good to have you back.

50:25.780 --> 50:29.620
Kincade Security Solutions,
founded in Switzerland 1942...

50:29.700 --> 50:31.140
...by a devout Christian. Get this.

50:31.140 --> 50:34.100
He used to inscribe biblical verse
on the side of their weapons...

50:34.180 --> 50:37.380
Recently experienced a fall in share prices
which they put down to...

50:37.380 --> 50:40.220
...and I quote,".. uncertainty over
U. S. Foreign policy...

50:40.340 --> 50:43.300
...and poor visibility on contracts
from the U.K Government. "

50:43.460 --> 50:44.580
What about Warns?

50:44.580 --> 50:46.500
No record he's ever worked for them
as a military contractor.

50:46.500 --> 50:48.140
Then you've got to find a
connection with Sternwood.

50:48.140 --> 50:50.180
- I've tried, there isn't one.
- Try harder.

50:50.180 --> 50:51.980
Has Warns traveled to Iceland
in the last 12 months?

50:52.020 --> 50:55.700
Were any weapons that Sternwood
used in the past Kincade? Come on!

50:55.860 --> 50:57.540
Where the fuck is Sarah?

50:57.860 --> 51:01.500
Find her, all right, tell her to call me.
Tell her if she's still pissed off...

51:01.540 --> 51:03.180
I've got something
that will cheer her up.

51:03.620 --> 51:04.580
- Oh, Sir?
- What?

51:04.580 --> 51:07.380
Otis Blake arrested a year
ago for a minor drug offense.

51:07.580 --> 51:10.220
Arresting officer: Harvey Crown.

51:14.020 --> 51:15.620
Well done.

51:20.060 --> 51:21.100
Nathan Bartnick.

51:21.100 --> 51:24.180
My son got involved with something
he didn't understand.

51:24.460 --> 51:26.060
And he paid the price.

51:27.660 --> 51:31.380
He's got a good heart,
unlike ours.

51:34.660 --> 51:37.620
- You killed Crown.
- You shot my son.

51:37.620 --> 51:39.060
No.

51:41.340 --> 51:42.980
But I know who did.

51:45.420 --> 51:46.900
Look, maybe we should
meet tonight.

51:47.900 --> 51:49.940
Talk this through.

51:51.780 --> 51:54.820
- I know a place.
- Where?

51:55.460 --> 51:56.700
A club.

52:42.060 --> 52:43.660
- You all right, mate?
- We're closed.

52:45.420 --> 52:48.380
Yeah... Yeah.
Did you get my message?

52:49.180 --> 52:51.780
Yeah, that's the second time.
That's the second time this week...

52:51.820 --> 52:54.060
...you sent me to fix a machine
when it's not broken.

52:54.420 --> 52:55.940
Yeah, so what's..

52:55.980 --> 53:00.380
I don't give a fuck what kind of-
It's fine mate, it's a balls-up at the office.

53:00.740 --> 53:03.700
I don't give a fuck what you said.
Just tell him he's a fucking moron.

53:13.540 --> 53:15.660
This is Sarah Hawks,
leave a message.

54:13.460 --> 54:15.540
Relaxing at a murder scene?

54:17.620 --> 54:19.580
That's commitment to the
cause, isn't it?

54:20.060 --> 54:22.100
How did you know I was here?

54:23.140 --> 54:24.900
I know everything.

54:25.940 --> 54:27.340
Don't doubt it.

54:30.740 --> 54:33.060
Night shift reported you here.

54:34.620 --> 54:36.100
I was looking for Sarah.

54:38.340 --> 54:40.980
What?
Lovers' tiff?

54:42.020 --> 54:44.620
You could say that.

54:45.020 --> 54:47.300
Do you want to know the real reason
they first asked you...

54:47.420 --> 54:49.700
...to head up the Sternwood case?

54:50.860 --> 54:52.300
Not fucking really.

54:52.300 --> 54:54.940
I dunno, my good looks, my charm?

54:57.140 --> 55:00.140
We hadn't been able to get anywhere
near Sternwood for years.

55:01.540 --> 55:05.540
Our incompetence could be passed
off as your inexperience.

55:16.780 --> 55:18.460
You were so fresh, Max.

55:19.900 --> 55:22.580
I knew you could take a couple of knocks
and keep on running.

55:25.860 --> 55:28.820
You worked harder than any man
that came before you.

55:28.860 --> 55:31.020
I mean, Christ, you nearly
caught him single-handedly.

55:31.060 --> 55:32.820
And you still had to fight
them to take me back.

55:35.020 --> 55:36.540
I never thanked you for that.

55:39.620 --> 55:42.620
So when you take him down this time,
you take him down hard, okay?

55:42.940 --> 55:45.540
And I'll make sure the whole
world is watching.

55:58.940 --> 56:01.820
I did something,
something I'm not proud of.

56:01.820 --> 56:04.420
So you better be right
on this, Max.

56:06.220 --> 56:08.380
I tapped Nathan's line.

56:10.500 --> 56:13.180
Someone called him
about the Greigo Mar.

56:14.460 --> 56:16.540
Nathan was guarded,
he was paranoid...

56:16.580 --> 56:18.620
...couldn't wait to get off
the phone quick enough.

56:18.980 --> 56:21.100
They're meeting tonight.

56:24.060 --> 56:25.420
They're meeting here.

56:28.700 --> 56:30.380
I want you to go and
check it out.

56:32.180 --> 56:33.740
Keep it contained, yeah?

56:35.300 --> 56:36.260
Yeah.

56:47.060 --> 56:49.060
Call me when it's through, yeah?

56:50.020 --> 56:51.100
Yeah.

56:58.140 --> 56:59.380
Sign here please, sir.

57:26.940 --> 57:28.740
You fucking owe me for this.

57:30.380 --> 57:32.780
I'd say this makes us
fair and square.

57:33.020 --> 57:34.540
The first one's in.

57:36.860 --> 57:38.860
Gun's ready to fire.

59:39.020 --> 59:40.300
Fuck!

59:44.700 --> 59:46.420
You take Sternwood, he's unarmed.

59:46.700 --> 59:48.180
I'll deal with Lewinsky.

01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:24.340
Jake?

01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:45.900
Move!
Go!

01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:48.860
Now take me to my son.

01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:59.060
I've been trying to call you, Max.
I'm glad you turned up.

01:02:59.100 --> 01:02:59.100
- Pete, we'll talk later, yeah?
- Yeah, right.

01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:01.260
I'm taking this man
to see his son.

01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:11.500
Give us two minutes, could you?

01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:19.780
What's this?

01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:30.820
Get out.

01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:33.540
Get out.

01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:32.620
What the fuck?

01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:35.740
Call for backup! Go!

01:05:35.940 --> 01:05:37.740
Deal with him or I fucking will.

01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:39.820
Just give me one minute.

01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:43.220
Walk away, Juka.

01:05:44.220 --> 01:05:46.900
You have to trust me, this isn't what
it looks like. Just turn around.

01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:52.660
Please, juka, you're gonna
get hurt. Just walk away.

01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:56.220
We found her body.

01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:59.100
We found her body in your bed.

01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:01.020
Juka, you armed?

01:07:53.940 --> 01:07:55.380
Who killed my son?

01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:03.900
Was it the police that came to
the hotel looking for money?

01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:08.420
The ones in the club?

01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:15.740
What about that girl?

01:08:19.779 --> 01:08:22.020
Who was she?
Was she involved?

01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:38.140
Why didn't you just kill me
that night?

01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:43.660
Why didn't you just kill me
in that tunnel?

01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:45.580
For what?

01:09:20.979 --> 01:09:24.380
Your son and Otis Blake were killed by
an ex-soldier called Dean Warns.

01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:26.819
That's the guy that focused
on me at the club tonight.

01:09:26.859 --> 01:09:28.300
He was working with Nathan Bartnick...

01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:30.580
...Harvey Crown, and possibly...

01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:33.859
...possibly Lieutenant Commander
Thomas Geiger.

01:09:37.939 --> 01:09:39.819
That girl...

01:09:41.620 --> 01:09:44.020
Sarah, had written
something on her hand:

01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:47.140
PUNCH 1-1-9

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:50.140
Now, Dean Warns was seen
at the container yard...

01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:51.859
...with Otis Blake the night of his murder.

01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:56.060
That place is separated into
three different docks:

01:09:56.220 --> 01:09:59.580
Turk, Acorn and The Punch.
And that's what I know.

01:10:00.540 --> 01:10:03.180
1-1-9 are container coordinates.

01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:08.780
We used to bring diesel in
off the ships.

01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:12.540
We'll end this tonight.

01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:15.980
And when it's over...

01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:20.420
you'll go to prison and I'll be
the one that puts you there.

01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:31.660
Nan?

01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:34.100
I got your message,
are you all right?

01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:36.500
What, you feel ill?

01:10:53.580 --> 01:10:54.900
Look who's here.

01:10:55.140 --> 01:10:58.100
It's your old mates from
the Second Battalion.

01:10:58.860 --> 01:11:00.660
All right, mate?

01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:04.700
- It's good to see you.
- There's fresh tea in the pot.

01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:08.300
Your old nan was just telling us how you
make big money working for some...

01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:10.100
...private military contractor.

01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:11.740
- Kincade.
- Yeah, that's it.

01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:14.620
Says they pay you straight into
some European bank account...

01:11:14.740 --> 01:11:15.660
...so you don't pay no tax.

01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:18.460
- No tax.
- That's amazing, mate.

01:11:19.660 --> 01:11:21.380
What sort of thing
they have you do?

01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:25.700
Oh, it's, um...

01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:29.140
...Pretty cloak-and-dagger.
- Yeah?

01:11:32.180 --> 01:11:34.780
- So when'd you turn up?
- Oh, not long ago, darling.

01:11:34.940 --> 01:11:38.500
They told me not to tell you.
Said you'd get a kick out of it.

01:11:38.540 --> 01:11:40.100
I wish you had, Nan.

01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:44.620
- I'm busy tonight.
- Come on, mate.

01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:48.100
Come and sit down.

01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:56.740
Yeah, why not?

01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:12.900
What could be more important
than seeing your old squad, darling?

01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:14.620
That's all right, Iris.

01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:17.540
We know how busy Dean's been
keeping himself recently.

01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:20.460
We were just telling your old nan how
we were the only ones to stick up for you.

01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:22.620
How we were the only ones
to speak up and voice our disgust...

01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:23.740
...when they forced early retirement.

01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:25.180
You were like a rock.

01:12:25.180 --> 01:12:27.500
Smuggling guns in the coffins
of dead soldiers.

01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:30.100
Yeah, you wouldn't be involved in
anything as sordid as that, would you?

01:12:30.100 --> 01:12:32.220
Let's hope it's all behind us.

01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:36.780
How's your son?

01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:38.780
I hear he's been getting himself
into a bit of stick.

01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:41.620
Yeah, unfortunately,
Ruan passed away recently.

01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:43.780
And that's why we've come
to see Dean.

01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:46.900
Take him down to the punch
for a few drinks.

01:12:47.180 --> 01:12:49.660
See our old friend, Thomas Geiger.

01:12:51.740 --> 01:12:54.620
- So how do we do this?
- Roy's feeling a bit rough.

01:12:54.860 --> 01:12:57.540
I get terrible migraines.
Feels like my head's gonna explode.

01:12:57.660 --> 01:12:59.580
He's gonna stay here
and keep her company.

01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:01.420
You don't mind if I stay here
and relax, do you, Iris?

01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:03.660
'Course I don't,
handsome man like you.

01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:05.780
Maybe they can watch
Calamity Jane.

01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:06.940
I can make us some more tea.

01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:08.780
No, no, no, Iris,
you just stay right there.

01:13:08.820 --> 01:13:10.340
Dean, what's going on?

01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:12.500
It's all right, Nan.

01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:17.940
I'll tell you why I'm
a good soldier.

01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:22.180
Because of selfless commitment.

01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:27.340
Otis Blake, Ruan Sternwood...

01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:30.380
Harvey Crown, Sarah Hawks...

01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:33.340
...all necessary casualties.

01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:36.580
All necessary fatalities
of this operation.

01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:38.820
Or maybe we're just
murderers, plain and simple.

01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:39.820
That's where you're wrong.

01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:42.820
I'm a superior soldier.

01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:44.860
You're just a hired fucking killer.

01:13:44.900 --> 01:13:46.300
I want to settle things.

01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:49.940
When I close this down...

01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:53.340
...it'll be because I put the operation
before my own needs.

01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:57.860
Told you before,
I'm wise to you...

01:13:58.260 --> 01:13:59.700
Max.

01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:05.380
You think keeping her hostage as
collateral's gonna force me into a corner.

01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:09.660
But none of you
have been where I have.

01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:13.300
Seen what I've seen.

01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:16.500
None of you have that
selfless commitment.

01:14:19.140 --> 01:14:21.340
Not one of you possesses
what it takes.

01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:26.740
To actually put a bullet
in the back of that woman's head.

01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:12.300
It's gonna be all right, Nan.
Just close your eyes.

01:15:21.060 --> 01:15:23.300
- Warns?
- I need you to meet me.

01:15:23.780 --> 01:15:25.180
At The Punch...

01:15:25.180 --> 01:15:26.580
...tonight at 12.

01:15:26.580 --> 01:15:27.820
Kincade want me to move them out.

01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:29.100
Lewinsky's getting too close.

01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:31.900
This could all explode in our hands.

01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:34.180
I can't do it, it's too risky for me.

01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:35.460
You meet me...

01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:38.340
Or I'll make sure all this lands
on your fucking head.

01:15:38.340 --> 01:15:40.140
- Why do you need me to come down?
- Just fucking do it!

01:15:47.740 --> 01:15:49.180
Oh, fuck!

01:15:55.260 --> 01:15:56.260
How you doing?

01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:02.500
I can't feel my legs, Jake.

01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:05.540
Really?

01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:08.420
Fuck off.

01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:12.460
- No, you fuck off!
- Jesus.

01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:24.220
You gonna be all right
staying here?

01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:26.060
Yeah.

01:16:27.660 --> 01:16:29.420
I'm sorry for this, man.

01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:32.460
No, no, no, you did good.
You did good.

01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:36.660
I'm sorry about your boy.

01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:41.020
Yeah.

01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:48.340
Ladies and gentlemen, the man who's
going to lead this party into government...

01:16:48.420 --> 01:16:52.460
...our friend, our leader, Henry Callaghan.

01:16:57.300 --> 01:16:59.940
You're a very difficult woman
to track down all of a sudden.

01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:02.140
It's a very busy time for me.

01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:08.100
Warns wants to meet me tonight.

01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:10.580
At The Punch.

01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:15.180
Who arranged this, was it you?
Kincade?

01:17:16.420 --> 01:17:20.140
Thought you had everything you needed.
All the headlines you require, am I right?

01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:26.020
Janie, you listening to me?

01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:29.300
Your little project came
apart at the seams.

01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:32.660
Max is an inch away from piecing
all this together...

01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:35.380
...and Sternwood is still at large,
so you better pay attention.

01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:36.860
Campaign's going very well.

01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:39.940
We're ahead in the polls, if that's
what you're referring to, Thom.

01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:42.580
No, it's not what I'm referring to.

01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:45.500
Who arranged tonight?

01:17:48.580 --> 01:17:51.140
- You've lost me, I'm afraid.
- You fuckin' bitch!

01:17:53.580 --> 01:17:56.980
People have died because of this...
Because of us.

01:17:57.340 --> 01:18:00.180
I've lost men all because of
your fucking progress...

01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:02.820
...and you sit there in denial
like some fucking royalty..

01:18:02.820 --> 01:18:04.340
...you don't even have the class
to look me in the eye.

01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:06.340
Thom, listen.

01:18:06.340 --> 01:18:09.740
I have to get this speech right with Robert.

01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:13.340
I think you did the right thing.

01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:20.860
I hope this pans out
for you, okay?

01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:34.340
Sorry to call you on this number.
But Warns can't be reached.

01:18:35.620 --> 01:18:37.980
It seems we've got a serious problem.

01:20:35.660 --> 01:20:38.060
You broke my fucking arm!

01:20:38.140 --> 01:20:40.300
Thom. Thom.

01:20:41.220 --> 01:20:42.940
You tell me what the fuck this is.

01:20:42.940 --> 01:20:44.780
Don't make things worse
for yourself, Max, eh?

01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:46.780
You stop this now
and we can settle it.

01:20:46.780 --> 01:20:48.540
You can't settle the death of Sarah.

01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:50.980
You can't settle trying to
set me up for murder.

01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:55.060
I am your commanding officer. Right now
you're wanted for the murder of your partner,

01:20:55.060 --> 01:20:56.220
...so you're going to need all the...

01:20:59.620 --> 01:21:01.180
Those two boys...

01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:04.900
...came here on the night of the seventh.
To buy guns from him.

01:21:06.980 --> 01:21:09.660
He was with Bartnick and Crown.

01:21:09.660 --> 01:21:11.900
And one of the boys, Blake,
recognized Crown...

01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:13.260
...he'd been arrested by him a year ago.

01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:15.500
And that compromised the deal.

01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:18.660
Blake died, but Ruan got away
with a hold-all full of money.

01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:20.380
You get your fucking
hands off me!

01:21:22.180 --> 01:21:24.460
Bartnick and Crown went to the
hotel looking for their money.

01:21:24.460 --> 01:21:26.060
They come across Sternwood.

01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:29.340
And you suddenly get worried that
I'm gonna piece things together.

01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:34.140
You, Thom, were meant
to be my friend.

01:21:35.980 --> 01:21:38.140
This can't just be about money.

01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:39.740
Not for you.

01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:47.060
Policemen weren't meant to die.

01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:52.860
It was all gonna be simple.

01:21:52.860 --> 01:21:55.380
It was gonna change things,
make things better for us.

01:21:57.340 --> 01:21:58.900
Robert Wiseman, he got it.

01:21:58.940 --> 01:22:02.860
Just... one more gun scandal and
his party would win the next election.

01:22:02.860 --> 01:22:03.940
Jane Badham?

01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:07.540
She found Warns.

01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:13.020
He shipped in the guns,
set up Otis and Ruan as buyers.

01:22:13.620 --> 01:22:16.700
I provided some manpower,
turned a blind eye, you know.

01:22:18.260 --> 01:22:20.580
Then a new squad would come in...

01:22:20.580 --> 01:22:22.220
...arrest the two boys
with the guns.

01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:25.340
Big public outcry,
Jane handles the PR...

01:22:25.780 --> 01:22:28.020
...and Wiseman takes
the next election.

01:22:29.300 --> 01:22:31.100
Kincade supplied Warns.

01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:33.900
Kincade'd get the multi-million-pound
contract to supply body armor...

01:22:33.900 --> 01:22:35.740
...training packages and guns to the police.

01:22:35.740 --> 01:22:36.980
Yeah.

01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:40.260
What do you get, Thom?

01:22:40.260 --> 01:22:41.540
What'd you get?

01:22:41.860 --> 01:22:44.140
You get a healthy bank account?

01:22:45.820 --> 01:22:48.460
Get fast-tracked to the role
of... What?

01:22:49.020 --> 01:22:50.060
Commissioner?

01:22:51.820 --> 01:22:54.220
All for obedience in the line
of fucking duty!

01:22:54.220 --> 01:22:54.980
Fuck off!

01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:58.580
You, more than anyone, should get
what's happening here, Max.

01:22:59.900 --> 01:23:02.980
I'm the one has to go and see Coppers'
families when they've been shot...

01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:05.820
...and murdered in the street 'cause
they haven't gotthe proper armor!

01:23:07.140 --> 01:23:10.220
What do you think's gonna happen, Max, eh?
You think we're just gonna walk out of here?

01:23:12.100 --> 01:23:14.380
Kincade have got all
the bases covered, you know?

01:23:16.020 --> 01:23:18.420
All this means too much to them.

01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:21.180
And Warns, eh?

01:23:21.180 --> 01:23:24.180
He's not just some fucking
amateur you just walk all over.

01:23:27.420 --> 01:23:29.260
You shouldn't have
brought him here, Max.

01:23:30.820 --> 01:23:33.580
You shouldn't have fucking
brought him here.

01:23:50.420 --> 01:23:52.220
Get to the car!
I'll cover!

01:24:46.860 --> 01:24:48.180
Let me have your gun.

01:25:09.900 --> 01:25:11.340
Selfless commitment.

01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:46.420
Think what he did to you, Max.

01:25:48.020 --> 01:25:50.420
Remember who helped you
come back, huh?

01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:53.380
You owe me.

01:25:55.500 --> 01:25:57.340
This is your chance, Max.

01:25:57.940 --> 01:25:59.620
You bring him in.

01:26:01.540 --> 01:26:03.780
- You bring that fucker in.
- Enough!

01:27:23.820 --> 01:27:26.420
- Clear!
- On me!

01:27:27.180 --> 01:27:29.700
I don't have visual.
