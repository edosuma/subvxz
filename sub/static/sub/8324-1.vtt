WEBVTT

00:46.504 --> 00:50.507
Forget me, you're on your way

00:50.675 --> 00:55.012
We don't have to stay in touch

00:55.180 --> 00:59.183
We may remember someday

00:59.350 --> 01:05.355
Till then it doesn't matter that much

01:07.525 --> 01:11.653
Someday I'll have to wonder

01:11.821 --> 01:15.741
And dreams may cloud the truth

01:15.909 --> 01:19.953
But if you promise me

01:20.121 --> 01:24.166
I promise I'll never forget you

01:24.334 --> 01:28.337
Forget the tears we cried

01:28.505 --> 01:32.633
Forget the good times too

01:32.801 --> 01:36.595
Forget the pain inside

01:36.763 --> 01:38.639
You will never see her again.

01:41.059 --> 01:45.729
Dude, after graduation, she'll be
gone until like the tenth reunion...

01:45.897 --> 01:47.523
...if you both even live
that long.

01:47.690 --> 01:52.611
And she'll be so very pregnant by
then, baking someone else's DNA.

01:52.779 --> 01:55.989
And she'll have this, like, big,
pregnant cow grin on her face.

01:56.157 --> 01:57.825
She won't even remember
who you are.

01:57.992 --> 02:00.077
Well, I sat behind her
in almost every class.

02:00.245 --> 02:02.329
Behind her.
Shh.

02:03.414 --> 02:05.290
Behind her.
She never saw you, dude.

02:05.458 --> 02:10.795
You don't give this big speech
at graduation, you don't exist.

02:10.964 --> 02:15.342
No, Denis, if you... If you don't
do this... If you don't do this...

02:15.510 --> 02:17.010
"You'll regret it.

02:17.178 --> 02:19.054
Maybe not today,
maybe not tomorrow, but soon...

02:19.222 --> 02:21.348
...and for the rest of your life."

02:21.516 --> 02:23.183
What are you talking about?

02:23.351 --> 02:25.352
Come on, it's Casablanca, 1942...

02:25.520 --> 02:26.770
...Michael Curtiz, director.

02:26.938 --> 02:28.438
Bogart, dude!
Shh.

02:28.606 --> 02:30.065
Seriously?

02:30.608 --> 02:31.942
Bogart.

02:46.207 --> 02:47.374
Thank you, Angelica.

02:47.542 --> 02:50.043
It's Angelica. Whatever.

02:50.837 --> 02:51.879
Angelica.

02:52.046 --> 02:57.134
Thank you for that rousing
rendition of "Forget Me."

02:57.719 --> 03:02.472
Next, and finally,
your valedictorian...

03:02.640 --> 03:03.932
...Denis Cooverman.

03:21.034 --> 03:24.661
Today we look forward.

03:25.330 --> 03:29.208
Look forward to getting out of here.

03:31.669 --> 03:33.086
Heh, heh, heh.

03:34.964 --> 03:39.968
But today, I would also like
to look back...

03:40.136 --> 03:45.390
...look back on our 4 years here
at Buffalo Glenn High School...

03:45.558 --> 03:49.311
...looking back not with anger...

03:49.479 --> 03:53.232
...but with no regrets.

03:54.901 --> 03:59.279
No regrets for what we wanted to do...

03:59.447 --> 04:01.365
...but did not...

04:01.532 --> 04:05.369
...what we wanted to say...

04:05.536 --> 04:08.872
...but could not.

04:12.710 --> 04:16.296
And so I say here today...

04:16.464 --> 04:19.507
...the one thing I wish I had said...

04:19.676 --> 04:25.889
...the one thing I know I will
regret if I never say:

04:28.393 --> 04:30.394
I love you, Beth Cooper.

04:42.532 --> 04:43.907
He likes you.

04:44.075 --> 04:47.411
I have loved you, Beth Cooper...

04:47.578 --> 04:53.583
...since I first sat behind you in Ms.
Rosa's math class in the 7th grade.

04:53.876 --> 04:54.918
Heh.

04:55.086 --> 04:59.923
I loved you when I sat behind you
in Senor Weidner's Spanish...

05:00.091 --> 05:04.094
...and Ms. Calumet-Hobey's
Literature of the Oppressed.

05:04.262 --> 05:06.179
I loved you from behind...

05:07.724 --> 05:14.271
...in Biology, History, and,
yes, Practical Science.

05:14.439 --> 05:19.735
I loved you, but I never told you
because we never spoke.

05:19.902 --> 05:21.111
Unbelievable.

05:21.279 --> 05:25.741
But now I say it, with no regrets.

05:26.284 --> 05:31.788
I love you, Beth Cooper.

05:32.457 --> 05:37.961
And so let us all say the things
that we longed to say...

05:38.129 --> 05:40.839
...but our tongues would not.

05:41.007 --> 05:43.759
Let us be unafraid to admit:

05:43.926 --> 05:48.972
"I have an eating disorder,
and I need help."

05:49.140 --> 05:51.683
Let us confess:

05:51.851 --> 05:54.519
"I'm a stuck-up bitch...

05:54.687 --> 06:00.233
...because deep down,
I believe I am worthless."

06:00.401 --> 06:02.402
Let us declare:

06:02.570 --> 06:06.656
"I'm a big, dumb moron.

06:06.824 --> 06:12.329
I'm a big old asshole who
beats up on other kids...

06:12.497 --> 06:18.085
...because I was unloved as a baby...

06:18.252 --> 06:21.505
...or was sexually abused
or something.

06:21.672 --> 06:24.841
I am sorry for the cruel swirlies...

06:25.009 --> 06:26.426
...the pink bellies...

06:26.594 --> 06:28.678
...the purple nurples."

06:29.305 --> 06:35.852
And let us, no, let all of us vow:

06:36.270 --> 06:41.358
"When I graduate, I'm not gonna keep
hanging around my old high school...

06:41.526 --> 06:43.693
...like some kind of creepy loser...

06:43.861 --> 06:46.196
...who can't get an adult girlfriend."

06:46.364 --> 06:49.616
You know who you are. You.

06:53.246 --> 06:58.417
And, yes, let us not regret...

06:58.584 --> 07:03.338
...that we never told
our own best friend:

07:06.551 --> 07:09.219
"I'm gay, dude.

07:09.387 --> 07:11.555
I'm totally gay."

07:11.722 --> 07:12.806
I'm not gay.

07:12.974 --> 07:14.808
Yes.

07:14.976 --> 07:16.977
Indeed. Let us all...

07:17.145 --> 07:18.728
Thank you, Denis.

07:18.896 --> 07:21.982
Food for thought.
Thank you.

07:22.984 --> 07:24.067
Thank you.

07:26.863 --> 07:28.071
Wow.

07:41.252 --> 07:42.752
Perfect.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.421
Whoa.
Oh.

07:44.589 --> 07:46.423
It's okay.
Sorry.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.634
Sorry.
All right.

08:02.106 --> 08:04.524
Mr. Cooverman, hi.
Hey! Hello.

08:04.692 --> 08:06.818
I've never known you to
do anything so reckless...

08:06.986 --> 08:08.028
...really at all reckless.

08:08.196 --> 08:09.613
Well, thank you.

08:09.780 --> 08:11.781
Uh, no. That is not
what I would expect...

08:11.949 --> 08:14.284
...from somebody
who is going to Stanford.

08:14.452 --> 08:15.619
You know one call from me...

08:15.786 --> 08:18.246
...and you could be going
to Harper Community College.

08:18.414 --> 08:20.832
That would be unimaginable.
You can't...

08:21.000 --> 08:23.710
Look, I don't know why I did th...
Who was that?

08:23.878 --> 08:26.505
That wasn't me.
I was under an influence.

08:26.672 --> 08:28.256
Are you drunk?
What?

08:29.008 --> 08:32.969
I just meant my thinking
had been compromised.

08:34.597 --> 08:37.474
Look, Rich told me if...
Rich Munsch?

08:37.642 --> 08:38.725
Yeah.

08:38.893 --> 08:43.480
I wouldn't take heterosexual
advice from Rich Munsch.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.649
But he was right.

08:45.816 --> 08:48.944
I mean, I had to do something.

08:49.529 --> 08:54.574
I'm not there in her brain.
She will have no memory of me.

08:54.742 --> 08:55.784
So?

08:55.952 --> 09:00.997
So? Come on, Dr. Gleason,
haven't you ever been in love?

09:25.606 --> 09:29.401
Your nipples are so weird.

09:36.492 --> 09:40.829
Denis, there's another
Beth Cooper out there.

09:41.497 --> 09:42.998
One just for you.

10:00.391 --> 10:02.142
You embarrassed me.

10:03.311 --> 10:04.644
Uh...

10:05.313 --> 10:08.148
But it was so sweet,
I'll have to let you live.

10:09.525 --> 10:14.029
Well, that's good.
Because I like to live.

10:14.196 --> 10:17.198
Is it like 800 degrees
in there, like boiling?

10:17.366 --> 10:23.455
Actually, the boiling point of water
is 212 degrees Fahrenheit...

10:24.457 --> 10:26.750
...100 degrees Celsius.

10:26.917 --> 10:29.169
I am so hot.

10:29.337 --> 10:31.421
I can imagine...

10:31.589 --> 10:33.673
...that you're hot.

10:33.841 --> 10:37.093
Hey. So I'm not gay, dude.

10:37.261 --> 10:39.929
Rich, hi.

10:41.849 --> 10:44.309
Hello, hi, hey. Hi.

10:44.477 --> 10:47.395
I didn't realize
there was a line here.

10:47.563 --> 10:49.439
No, no, that's okay.
I gotta go.

10:49.607 --> 10:52.692
Halt! I mean, wait.

10:52.860 --> 10:55.278
There's a little soiree
at my house tonight.

10:55.446 --> 10:56.446
Course that's redundant...

10:56.614 --> 10:58.281
...I don't know what
I'm talking about.

10:58.449 --> 11:02.786
No, a party. More of a party than
a French thing. Music, drinks, prizes.

11:02.953 --> 11:04.204
Party.

11:04.372 --> 11:07.457
Sounds fun.
It is fun, will be, in the future.

11:07.625 --> 11:10.335
And goddamn it,
you're invited, officially.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.003
Wow.

11:12.296 --> 11:13.296
Thanks.

11:13.464 --> 11:15.131
6337 Hackberry Drive...

11:15.299 --> 11:18.343
...ZIP's 98401,
if you're Mapquesting.

11:18.511 --> 11:19.928
Well, maybe we could stop by.

11:20.096 --> 11:21.221
Cool, or not,
whatever.

11:21.389 --> 11:24.140
I mean, you come, you come.
If you don't, you don't.

11:24.350 --> 11:28.478
You humiliated me
and insulted her.

11:29.146 --> 11:30.980
Are you prepared to die?

11:31.357 --> 11:33.483
Sorry.

11:34.985 --> 11:37.404
You must be
Beth Cooper's boyfriend.

11:38.823 --> 11:40.824
I have to go
to the bathroom.

11:42.034 --> 11:43.368
Um...

11:48.499 --> 11:53.420
I'm gonna give you 10 seconds to
convince me why I should let you live.

11:54.213 --> 11:57.507
I think you mean "persuade," not
"convince."

11:57.675 --> 11:59.008
Is there a problem here?

12:08.352 --> 12:10.061
No, ma'am.

12:11.188 --> 12:13.356
My hand,
it just slipped.

12:13.816 --> 12:18.027
You know I can't allow you
to kill him on school property?

12:18.487 --> 12:19.612
Yes, ma'am.

12:21.198 --> 12:23.324
Baby. Not nice.

12:28.706 --> 12:30.373
You okay?
Great, yeah.

12:30.541 --> 12:34.335
Okay. You know, on the bright side,
Beth Cooper talked to you.

12:34.837 --> 12:37.046
Whoo!
Let's go!

12:37.214 --> 12:41.050
School's out! We did it!
We did it! Party!

12:41.218 --> 12:43.636
Ooh. That can't be good.

12:49.101 --> 12:50.143
Losers!

12:50.311 --> 12:52.270
All right,
keep in touch.

12:52.438 --> 12:57.400
So, look, I'm not gay,
you know, so... Yeah.

12:57.568 --> 12:59.027
Okay, yeah.

12:59.195 --> 13:02.572
No, I mean, it's cool
if you are, too, really.

13:02.740 --> 13:05.575
Really, I'm not.
No soyhomo.

13:05.743 --> 13:07.285
All right.
That's awesome.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.078
What makes you
think I'm gay?

13:10.748 --> 13:13.082
I don't know... Everybody
thinks you're gay, Rich.

13:13.250 --> 13:14.709
Well, they don't know me.
You know me.

13:14.877 --> 13:17.003
What makes you
think I'm gay?

13:33.103 --> 13:35.188
Okay, I got an idea.

13:35.356 --> 13:37.607
I'm Robin Hood.
You're Friar Tuck.

13:37.775 --> 13:40.944
We get your dad's camcorder and
we do a shot-for-shot re-creation...

13:41.111 --> 13:43.696
...of their climactic
sword fight...

13:44.657 --> 13:46.699
...using our boners. Ha.

13:55.793 --> 13:58.795
Nothing in particular,
I guess.

13:58.963 --> 14:00.839
Well, I mean, is it
because of Drama Club?

14:01.006 --> 14:03.967
Because, you know, a lot of
professional actors aren't gay.

14:04.134 --> 14:05.510
More than half.

14:05.678 --> 14:10.431
Rich, it's just that all through
high school and even before...

14:10.599 --> 14:14.435
...you never really
had a girlfriend.

14:14.603 --> 14:16.771
Neither did you.
I tried.

14:16.939 --> 14:18.606
Oh, ha, ha, ha. Patty Keck?

14:18.774 --> 14:21.025
Her, yes.
Your secret shame.

14:21.193 --> 14:24.320
My point is... I had one.

14:24.488 --> 14:26.573
Just so you know, making out
with a girl like that...

14:26.740 --> 14:28.491
I'm not sure that's not gay.

14:32.621 --> 14:35.540
What is this? Give me it.
Let go of it. I wanna see.

14:36.166 --> 14:37.500
No.
Wow.

14:37.835 --> 14:38.835
Whatever.

14:39.003 --> 14:41.170
That's awesome. IPod.
It's silly.

14:41.338 --> 14:43.339
No, that's really nice.
That's great.

14:43.507 --> 14:45.300
Yeah, my mom and dad
gave it...

14:46.260 --> 14:48.136
Dude, you know what
I got for graduation?

14:48.304 --> 14:50.388
No.
A bill.

14:50.556 --> 14:54.767
Yeah, my dad says I owe
him 233,850 bucks.

14:54.935 --> 14:56.603
A quarter of a million dollars?

14:56.770 --> 15:00.023
And then they expect you
to buy your own shoes.

15:00.190 --> 15:03.860
Yeah. Well, no, that includes 50 grand
for "wear and tear" on my mother.

15:05.112 --> 15:08.156
She is pretty worn and torn,
you know.

15:08.324 --> 15:09.824
Yeah.

15:10.743 --> 15:15.705
Well, in any case, I'm sorry
your dad's such a dick.

15:15.873 --> 15:19.709
And it was completely itemized,
very detailed.

15:20.294 --> 15:22.503
Who knew he was
paying attention?

15:35.601 --> 15:38.102
Day-oh.
Hey.

15:38.270 --> 15:40.021
Check out the new kicks.
Oh, cool.

15:40.189 --> 15:45.276
2 paychecks. Very Gene Kelly,
circa 1945, don't you think?

15:45.444 --> 15:46.903
Yeah. They're nice.
Dude.

15:47.071 --> 15:48.488
Don't be so nervous.
She's not gonna come.

15:48.656 --> 15:51.658
I'm not nervous, I'm particular.
There's a difference.

15:51.825 --> 15:53.159
You know what,
they can smell fear.

15:53.327 --> 15:55.954
No, they can't.
I can smell it.

15:57.623 --> 15:58.665
Ooh.
Ooh.

15:58.832 --> 16:00.124
Fear.
Mm.

16:00.292 --> 16:03.461
You know, puberty has done
nothing but screw me.

16:03.629 --> 16:04.837
Dude, what are you doing?

16:05.005 --> 16:06.673
I'm airing out my shirt.

16:06.840 --> 16:07.882
What?
Come on.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.300
I don't want a stinky shirt.

16:09.468 --> 16:11.678
Dude. Ha, ha, ha.

16:11.845 --> 16:13.930
Why are you laughing?
This is how you do this.

16:15.557 --> 16:17.684
Hey. Mom, Dad.

16:17.851 --> 16:19.769
Well, it looks like this
party's well underway.

16:19.937 --> 16:21.187
Hola, Mrs. C.

16:21.355 --> 16:22.814
Rich, don't call me Mrs. C,
I mean it.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.608
Now get off the counter.
Oh.

16:25.776 --> 16:27.610
Denis Petey Cooverman,
look at you.

16:27.778 --> 16:29.070
You look so cute.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.447
Super cute.

16:31.615 --> 16:32.657
She doesn't mean that.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.075
You look good.
You look cool.

16:34.243 --> 16:35.284
Yeah.

16:35.452 --> 16:39.122
You just might want to lower the
waist of those pants a little bit.

16:39.289 --> 16:41.874
Oh, you're not wearing
those awful underpants.

16:42.042 --> 16:43.292
Mom. God.

16:43.460 --> 16:44.919
I gotta go along with your mom...

16:45.087 --> 16:47.422
...on the lucky underpants, buddy.
What if you do get lucky?

16:47.589 --> 16:49.882
Once she gets to the underpants,
they're a deal breaker.

16:50.050 --> 16:51.801
They are not nice underpants.

16:51.969 --> 16:54.637
He is not wearing those ratty things,
and he's not getting lucky.

16:54.805 --> 16:57.140
Not on my watch.

16:58.642 --> 17:01.644
So, how many people are you
expecting at this shin-dizzle?

17:01.812 --> 17:04.105
Oh, not too many.
None.

17:04.272 --> 17:07.817
Well, it wouldn't be a celebration
without champagne.

17:07.984 --> 17:11.069
Oh.
Oh, ho, ho. That is negligent.

17:11.238 --> 17:13.031
My dad used to give me
an occasional beer...

17:13.198 --> 17:15.324
...but that was just to
get me to take a nap.

17:16.160 --> 17:19.244
Well, one glass per guest.
And no one who drinks, drives.

17:19.413 --> 17:22.290
And I know exactly how many
bottles are in the wine rack: 23.

17:22.833 --> 17:24.333
Here's all of our numbers....

17:24.501 --> 17:27.170
If anybody's dead or on fire,
call 911 first.

17:28.797 --> 17:30.423
What's the matter?
Bad advice?

17:30.591 --> 17:33.092
I have to get my purse.
I'll meet you out front.

17:33.260 --> 17:35.094
Honey, have fun.
Okay.

17:35.262 --> 17:36.345
Not too much fun.

17:36.513 --> 17:39.098
Not much danger
of that, Mrs. C.

17:39.266 --> 17:41.100
Bye, Mom!
Bye, honey.

17:41.727 --> 17:43.853
Denis, let me talk to you.

17:48.192 --> 17:52.403
Okay, look. This is your
last summer before college.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.197
That accelerated
medical program...

17:54.364 --> 17:56.240
...isn't gonna leave time
for parties...

17:56.408 --> 17:58.493
...so I want you to enjoy
this summer.

17:58.660 --> 18:00.203
Okay, yeah, sure, no,
I'll try.

18:00.370 --> 18:01.454
Get out there!

18:01.622 --> 18:04.540
Do all those teen things you
haven't had a chance to do.

18:04.708 --> 18:06.876
That's gonna be hard.
He hasn't done any of them.

18:07.211 --> 18:11.297
You know, this whole teenager
coming-of-age thing, I mean...

18:11.465 --> 18:13.841
...it's a relatively new construct.

18:14.009 --> 18:16.385
They came up with it in the 50's,
so...

18:16.553 --> 18:18.888
It's okay just
to have fun sometimes.

18:19.056 --> 18:22.391
Sometimes you just have to say,
"What the F."

18:22.559 --> 18:25.228
Curtis Armstrong, Risky Business,
1983, Paul Brickman.

18:25.395 --> 18:30.066
Except he didn't say "F,"
he said "Fuck."

18:32.444 --> 18:35.321
You know what I mean.
Carpe diem.

18:35.489 --> 18:38.866
I didn't know you were
such a movie buff, Mr. C.

18:39.034 --> 18:40.701
Robin Williams in
Dead Poets Society.

18:40.869 --> 18:45.414
Yes, thank you. Thank you,
Rich. We know. It's good.

18:45.582 --> 18:47.250
Come here, please.

18:51.964 --> 18:56.676
There are condoms
in my bedside table.

18:59.263 --> 19:02.765
Do you, like, know exactly
how many there are?

19:03.934 --> 19:07.937
They are not toys.

19:10.274 --> 19:12.441
Yeah.
Sure.

19:17.156 --> 19:20.116
I think my dad wants us
to have sex.

19:20.784 --> 19:22.493
With each other?
No.

19:22.661 --> 19:23.744
Right.

19:23.912 --> 19:27.123
She should really be here by now.

19:27.749 --> 19:29.458
So your parents use condoms?

19:29.626 --> 19:31.878
Not a topic for discussion.
Ever.

19:32.045 --> 19:33.462
Okay. No, it's okay.
I won't.

19:33.630 --> 19:36.299
I just, yeah, I mean, what,
do you think they're lubed? Or...

19:36.466 --> 19:37.925
Incoming!

19:40.387 --> 19:42.138
Go, go, go!

20:13.003 --> 20:14.962
It's the trinity.

20:21.929 --> 20:24.347
So where's our boy
in uniform?

20:24.514 --> 20:25.640
He's on our shit list.

20:25.807 --> 20:28.517
One of his army buddies was
getting all date-rapey with Treece.

20:28.685 --> 20:29.727
Oh.
Oh.

20:29.895 --> 20:31.854
So, where's the party?

20:32.022 --> 20:35.358
This is it.
Here, this location.

20:35.525 --> 20:36.859
Welcome.

20:37.027 --> 20:39.195
Come on in.

20:39.363 --> 20:43.783
Warning, roof may be blown off
due to excessive partying.

20:44.618 --> 20:47.370
Well, go ahead,
princess.

20:47.704 --> 20:49.830
Come on up. Yeah.

20:49.998 --> 20:51.290
Watch your step.

20:51.458 --> 20:55.127
Now entering
the party pod, captain.

20:56.964 --> 20:58.297
Um...

20:59.049 --> 21:00.466
Are we the first ones here?

21:02.135 --> 21:03.761
Yeah,
we are never first.

21:03.929 --> 21:05.805
I've never been
in this house before.

21:06.598 --> 21:10.434
La fiesta esthis way,
mi bonitas.

21:11.561 --> 21:16.440
Por favor, sweet and salty
comidas for your comesting.

21:16.608 --> 21:20.861
Everything's organic.
The pretzels are fat free.

21:21.154 --> 21:22.697
Are you calling me fat?

21:23.115 --> 21:24.240
What?

21:24.408 --> 21:25.908
No. Not... No.

21:28.036 --> 21:31.998
Hey, come on, you, fat? Why would
he say that? He's not retarded.

21:32.165 --> 21:34.000
My brother's retarded.

21:42.384 --> 21:44.427
That's... That was... That's cold.

21:44.594 --> 21:46.387
You probably don't even
have a brother.

21:46.555 --> 21:48.264
No, he, uh... He died.

21:50.600 --> 21:54.312
Yeah, that was really...
You got me, that was...

22:03.864 --> 22:06.282
I'm so sorry.

22:09.494 --> 22:11.454
It was a long time ago, but thanks.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.124
Yeah.

22:21.298 --> 22:23.466
What do you want,
Kevin?

22:23.633 --> 22:24.717
I need beer.

22:24.885 --> 22:27.136
Heh, heh. Yeah, you do.
Uh...

22:28.013 --> 22:30.765
Donde esta la beer,
Coovemaster?

22:30.932 --> 22:32.308
My dad doesn't drink beer.

22:34.644 --> 22:36.520
We have champagne.

22:36.688 --> 22:39.648
Ooh. Okay.

22:40.317 --> 22:43.736
Champagne.
Bubbly goodness. Uh...

22:44.321 --> 22:49.116
This is Cristal.
It's the drink of the pimps.

22:49.284 --> 22:51.535
"The pimps?"
Mm-hm.

22:51.703 --> 22:53.954
What do you know
about pimps?

22:55.540 --> 22:57.958
Nothing, really.

22:58.835 --> 23:02.713
Mm. Cristal seems to have
changed its logo and spelling.

23:02.881 --> 23:06.342
Champagne makes me
do... things.

23:07.260 --> 23:09.595
Girl, water makes you
do things.

23:09.763 --> 23:12.181
Not regular water.

23:12.349 --> 23:16.769
Ha, ha.
Oh, yeah, okay. I, uh...

23:29.950 --> 23:30.991
Classic.

23:31.785 --> 23:33.661
I told you.

23:34.037 --> 23:35.538
No, I don't.

23:35.705 --> 23:39.875
No!
No, you can't come here.

23:41.211 --> 23:43.045
Yeah, well...

23:44.214 --> 23:45.881
Maybe.

23:46.049 --> 23:47.800
I'm busy right now, Kevin.

23:47.968 --> 23:49.343
I want some of that.

23:49.511 --> 23:52.847
No, I will not tell you
where I am or who I'm with...

23:53.014 --> 23:58.018
...but I will tell you this, Kevin,
I'm drinking champagne.

23:58.186 --> 24:00.229
Yep. And it is coming right...

24:00.397 --> 24:04.442
Aah! Oh. God. Oh.

24:04.609 --> 24:06.235
It's okay. Oh.

24:08.029 --> 24:10.072
Oh, nothing.
Yeah.

24:10.740 --> 24:11.907
Pfft. Heh.

24:15.912 --> 24:18.247
I'll get this off here.

24:19.416 --> 24:20.916
Would you hurry up?

24:21.084 --> 24:23.127
Yeah, I'm sorry. It's just...

24:23.295 --> 24:26.255
The internal pressure is 90 pounds
per square inch...

24:26.423 --> 24:28.048
...so I don't really know
what the problem...

24:28.216 --> 24:32.595
Don't you dare GPS me.
Oh, please.

24:38.435 --> 24:41.061
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm great.

24:41.229 --> 24:42.688
I need ice!

24:42.856 --> 24:45.608
Okay, let's see.

24:46.776 --> 24:48.569
Frozen peas.

24:48.737 --> 24:51.363
Really? Okay.

24:51.698 --> 24:55.034
And frozen peas.

24:55.202 --> 24:57.453
Frozen peas. Frozen peas.

24:57.621 --> 24:58.954
Anything cold.

24:59.623 --> 25:02.791
Okay, here. Something cold.

25:03.835 --> 25:04.960
Here, come here.

25:05.629 --> 25:07.463
Okay, here we go.

25:07.631 --> 25:11.550
I'm sorry I'm so pathetic.

25:11.718 --> 25:12.927
Let me tell you something:

25:13.094 --> 25:15.471
All boys are pathetic.

25:15.639 --> 25:18.307
Well, then I apologize
on behalf of all boys.

25:18.475 --> 25:21.936
And sorry
for all the wars and stuff.

25:22.812 --> 25:24.522
You're funny.

25:26.900 --> 25:28.234
How does that feel?

25:36.034 --> 25:37.868
Pretty good, I guess.

25:55.971 --> 25:58.055
Did you hurt
your back?

25:59.808 --> 26:00.849
Oh. Hee, hee.

26:01.184 --> 26:03.686
Yeah, I hurt my back.

26:04.020 --> 26:05.521
Ah. Ooh!

26:08.108 --> 26:09.358
Party balloons.

26:09.526 --> 26:12.027
Those aren't party balloons.
I know what they are.

26:12.195 --> 26:14.238
So, is this what you
had planned for tonight?

26:14.406 --> 26:15.698
No, those are my dad's.

26:15.865 --> 26:18.158
Your dad's not hiding in
the closet or something?

26:18.326 --> 26:20.494
Oh, I hate that.

26:24.207 --> 26:25.249
This was fun.

26:25.417 --> 26:29.545
No, come on. Stick around.
Okay, no, you can't go.

26:29.713 --> 26:30.754
No, wait, wait, wait.

26:30.922 --> 26:33.632
I mean, we've still got
wine to drink. 23 bottles.

26:33.800 --> 26:36.051
Oh, wine reminds me
of Jesus.

26:36.219 --> 26:38.053
You know what, Denis,
we really do have to go.

26:38.221 --> 26:40.222
This was a great party, though.

26:52.986 --> 26:54.737
Oh, shit, Kevin.

26:54.904 --> 26:56.614
He triangulated
your cell phone.

27:00.410 --> 27:02.411
We're gonna need
more waffles.

27:14.758 --> 27:17.051
Sean, you naughty boy.

27:19.429 --> 27:20.763
No, no, no, no.

27:23.600 --> 27:25.893
Nobody move.
Why?

27:26.061 --> 27:28.604
Because he is going to kill me.

27:29.189 --> 27:31.440
The most he's gonna do
is beat you up a little.

27:31.608 --> 27:34.443
Lisbee! Lisbee,
open this door!

27:35.612 --> 27:39.114
The windows! Secure the windows!

27:42.452 --> 27:44.578
Get out here!

27:45.288 --> 27:46.330
Is he always like this?

27:46.498 --> 27:49.333
This is new behavior,
but not surprising.

27:54.464 --> 27:56.715
He's kind of cute.

27:57.592 --> 27:58.634
Kind of.

28:05.892 --> 28:07.476
Oh, my God.

28:10.897 --> 28:12.272
Don't be afraid, I can handle this.

28:12.440 --> 28:13.482
I wasn't afraid.

28:13.650 --> 28:15.067
Why would you think I was afraid?

28:15.235 --> 28:17.069
Congratulations, you found me.

28:17.237 --> 28:20.572
Interesting situation
we have here.

28:20.740 --> 28:22.616
Have you been doing coke?

28:22.784 --> 28:24.326
Not now, Lisbee.

28:24.494 --> 28:25.494
He's coked up?

28:25.662 --> 28:28.622
That is not one
of the good drugs.

28:32.502 --> 28:35.421
Hey!
Aunt Brenda gave us that!

28:36.673 --> 28:38.424
Prepare to die.

28:39.843 --> 28:43.804
Okay, that's Mandy Patinkin in
The Princess Bride, Rob Reiner, 1987.

28:43.972 --> 28:46.098
Also the same line
was used by Emperor Zurg...

28:47.600 --> 28:49.268
Oh, my God!

28:52.605 --> 28:54.356
Stop it! Stop!

28:54.524 --> 28:57.401
Now, this is willful damage
to property!

28:57.569 --> 28:58.610
That's a legal term!

29:03.491 --> 29:04.867
Go!

29:07.579 --> 29:09.663
Kevin, stop!

29:09.831 --> 29:11.123
Hey, hey, hey.

29:11.541 --> 29:14.209
No, Denis! Have you ever seen
any of the Friday The 13ths?

29:14.377 --> 29:16.462
You run upstairs, you die!

29:26.723 --> 29:29.892
A weapon,
we need a weapon.

29:33.646 --> 29:36.356
Oh, my God.
Find weapons. Aah!

29:44.908 --> 29:46.450
Denis!

30:12.560 --> 30:14.186
I know what you're thinking.

30:15.104 --> 30:19.691
And, yes, this is
a polycarbonate blade.

30:23.780 --> 30:27.115
I took some workshops
at the Star Wars convention.

30:29.410 --> 30:30.702
Dr. McCoy.

30:32.038 --> 30:35.749
That used to be a person,
so you show some respect!

30:45.802 --> 30:49.721
Rich, I need your help.
Come out of the closet!

31:01.359 --> 31:03.527
Uh, uh, okay.

31:18.960 --> 31:21.336
Go, get out of here!

31:21.629 --> 31:23.088
Go!

31:28.678 --> 31:30.220
Weird.
Rich?

31:30.388 --> 31:33.557
Yeah? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, Denis?

31:34.809 --> 31:37.519
Over here, over here.
Are you okay?

31:37.687 --> 31:40.480
Yeah, I'm coming. I'm fine.

31:40.648 --> 31:41.815
Rich, what are you doing?

31:41.983 --> 31:44.318
I think I've made
a terrible decision.

31:44.485 --> 31:46.987
At which point did you think
that was a good decision?

31:47.155 --> 31:48.947
Yeah, no, no, no, I d...

31:53.995 --> 31:55.037
Rich!

31:55.204 --> 31:56.872
Denis?

32:17.727 --> 32:18.727
Are you okay?

32:18.895 --> 32:21.897
I'm paralyzed.
I'm a paralyzed virgin.

32:22.065 --> 32:23.774
You'll be okay.

32:23.942 --> 32:25.859
Quadriplegics can have sex.

32:26.027 --> 32:28.987
I saw a documentary about it
once on public television.

32:29.155 --> 32:30.405
Let's go. Come on.

32:30.573 --> 32:33.075
Yeah.
Okay.

32:36.955 --> 32:39.373
Sean, Dustin, come on!

32:42.126 --> 32:43.168
Go, go, go!

32:52.261 --> 32:53.887
They're like cyborgs.

32:55.765 --> 32:57.099
Denis?

33:01.938 --> 33:07.150
Rich! Rich! Rich!

33:14.450 --> 33:18.578
Why did you do that?
I thought you were smart.

33:18.746 --> 33:21.873
I was smart.

33:22.041 --> 33:27.295
Oh, my God.
Get him in the car.

33:27.922 --> 33:30.132
Come on.
Are you okay?

33:30.299 --> 33:31.842
Oh, my gosh.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.802
Wait, Rich.

33:43.104 --> 33:45.605
Lisbee! Stop the car.

33:48.026 --> 33:49.735
Hey! Come back here!

33:49.902 --> 33:52.487
Call me when you're sober!

34:07.462 --> 34:09.920
Are you okay?
Yeah, no, I'm fi...

34:12.507 --> 34:13.675
No blood.

34:17.972 --> 34:23.685
Beth, we got away, so you can
stop escaping now if you want to.

34:23.853 --> 34:25.687
She always drives
like this.

34:27.356 --> 34:29.775
I was in Driver's Ed with her.

34:29.942 --> 34:30.984
You could slow down.

34:31.152 --> 34:32.610
We're gonna try
to watch the cones.

34:32.779 --> 34:34.529
We're gonna watch
the road.

34:34.864 --> 34:36.031
Oh! I... Oh.

34:37.366 --> 34:38.992
Not good, not good. Oh!

34:41.370 --> 34:42.871
I'm gonna need you
to pull over.

34:43.289 --> 34:45.290
Oh, shit!

34:49.295 --> 34:51.545
Great, you just killed
everybody in the car.

34:55.717 --> 34:58.220
I'm, like, the least notable
person in this car.

34:58.387 --> 35:02.224
When we all die, I'll be
referred to as fifth student.

35:03.392 --> 35:05.393
So, Beth, uh...

35:05.561 --> 35:08.772
...I just wanna say thanks
for rescuing me...

35:08.940 --> 35:11.483
...back there after
you hit me with your car.

35:11.651 --> 35:12.692
That was pretty cool.

35:12.860 --> 35:16.780
No, you ran into my car.

35:16.948 --> 35:20.534
And I'm not rescuing you.
Kevin is heavily medicated right now.

35:20.701 --> 35:24.162
Cocaine, speed, roid rage,
and he can't have another incident.

35:24.330 --> 35:26.164
He'll get court-martialed
for sure.

35:26.332 --> 35:28.375
Sure, yeah.

35:29.127 --> 35:31.920
Do you remember the specifics
of his last incident?

35:33.256 --> 35:36.633
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa!

35:39.428 --> 35:41.596
Stupid drivers.

35:41.764 --> 35:46.893
Could I borrow your cell phone?
I left mine back at the house.

35:48.104 --> 35:50.689
Thank you very much.
I'll just...

36:00.283 --> 36:02.951
Honey. Honey, you're vibrating.
You bet I am.

36:03.119 --> 36:05.412
No, honey, honey,
it could be Denis.

36:09.834 --> 36:12.502
I don't recognize the number.
Do you?

36:12.670 --> 36:15.338
Sorry.
No.

36:15.923 --> 36:18.008
Must be a telemarketer.

36:25.433 --> 36:29.144
Oh, Mr. Cooverman.

36:32.064 --> 36:33.857
Hey, Mom, Dad, it...

36:34.025 --> 36:37.861
Hi, Mrs. C.
Hi, Mrs. C!

36:38.029 --> 36:39.988
Yeah, that was just Rich...

36:40.156 --> 36:42.741
...and we're okay.

36:42.909 --> 36:45.952
And I can explain the kitchen later.

36:46.120 --> 36:49.247
If you need to reach me,
you can reach me at...

36:51.125 --> 36:54.336
Beth, I'm sorry, can I get
your cell phone number?

36:55.213 --> 36:57.297
Shit, my phone!

36:57.465 --> 36:58.924
Kevin's probably tracking it.

36:59.091 --> 37:01.843
Aah.
GPS that, asshole!

37:04.513 --> 37:05.764
Asshole.

37:07.850 --> 37:08.850
Cool.

37:09.018 --> 37:13.188
I rebuke you in the name of Jesus.

37:13.356 --> 37:15.273
Ugh. Radio sucks.

37:16.734 --> 37:21.112
Actually, why don't you
tune that to 87.1?

37:21.280 --> 37:26.368
Cooked up a little commencement
mix that I think all of you will enjoy.

37:26.535 --> 37:31.206
DJ C's slamming graduation.
What!

37:46.889 --> 37:50.141
Well, we got no choice

37:50.309 --> 37:53.561
All the girls and boys

37:53.729 --> 37:57.065
Makin' all that noise

37:57.233 --> 38:00.402
'Cause they found new toys

38:00.903 --> 38:03.238
Well, we can't salute you

38:03.406 --> 38:05.031
Can't find a flag

38:05.199 --> 38:08.868
If that don't suit you
That's a drag

38:09.036 --> 38:13.707
School's out for summer

38:15.751 --> 38:20.755
School's out forever

38:20.923 --> 38:23.258
Ever.

38:23.426 --> 38:27.595
School's been blown to pieces

38:27.763 --> 38:29.180
Yeah.

38:29.348 --> 38:33.893
I love this song. Who wouldn't
want to blow up their school?

38:45.281 --> 38:47.615
Crack him like a walnut.

38:49.910 --> 38:51.286
Hello.

38:53.289 --> 38:55.206
Sorry.

38:56.542 --> 38:58.293
Let's get some beer.

39:04.508 --> 39:08.470
So, uh, I think I was knocked
out back there momentarily...

39:08.637 --> 39:14.893
...because I definitely wasn't, uh,
you know, looking or anything.

39:15.061 --> 39:17.937
Yuck.
What?

39:18.105 --> 39:21.149
Maybe we should get you some
Band-Aids or cream or something.

39:21.317 --> 39:25.779
Oh, no. No, no, no,
I'm... I'm...

39:25.946 --> 39:29.657
Wow, your eyes aren't blue.

39:31.077 --> 39:32.118
My eyes?

39:32.286 --> 39:35.497
Yeah, there's like some
green in there and then...

39:35.664 --> 39:40.001
...on the pupil, there's like a hazel
starburst sort of thing going on.

39:41.295 --> 39:45.840
Uh, my grandma used to call
them a real dog's breakfast.

39:46.467 --> 39:47.842
Lucky dog.

39:51.514 --> 39:53.640
So, what kind of beer
do you like?

39:53.808 --> 39:55.600
What kind? All kinds.

39:55.768 --> 39:59.687
I'm a maniac
for the brewdog.

40:04.026 --> 40:06.820
Chips, chips, chips.

40:08.197 --> 40:09.864
Got it?
Yep, I got it.

40:10.032 --> 40:12.283
Suzy Q's, yum.

40:12.868 --> 40:14.786
My mom says yum.

40:15.538 --> 40:16.871
Yum.

40:17.039 --> 40:18.373
Not like that,
that's...

40:18.541 --> 40:20.875
Got it?
Yep, good.

40:21.877 --> 40:23.211
Hi.
Hey.

40:23.379 --> 40:25.713
How are you?
Really good.

40:29.009 --> 40:30.885
There you go.

40:33.889 --> 40:35.557
What's with
your boyfriend?

40:35.724 --> 40:38.393
Oh, he's my
little brother.

40:39.645 --> 40:41.396
What happened
to his face?

40:42.648 --> 40:44.899
Dad beats him.

40:45.401 --> 40:46.484
Sorry I asked.

40:47.945 --> 40:50.071
Oh, uh... Heh, heh.

40:50.239 --> 40:51.823
I'm gonna need
to see some ID.

40:53.159 --> 40:55.034
Of course.

40:57.872 --> 40:59.456
Here you go.

41:01.250 --> 41:04.586
Wow. You've lost weight,
Patricia.

41:04.753 --> 41:06.754
You certainly
don't look 37.

41:06.922 --> 41:08.756
Well, thank you.

41:11.218 --> 41:15.513
So that's $15.42,
without the beer.

41:16.682 --> 41:20.226
Come on. It's graduation night.

41:20.394 --> 41:24.564
Oh, well,
"congradulations."

41:26.275 --> 41:28.401
Sam.

41:28.569 --> 41:31.237
You seem like a cool guy, Sam.

41:31.405 --> 41:34.282
Come on. Be cool.

41:35.951 --> 41:38.745
Look,
I could lose my shitty job.

41:42.416 --> 41:46.628
How about I kiss you so hard,
every time you think about it...

41:46.795 --> 41:48.796
...you'll have to change
your underwear?

41:57.890 --> 41:59.599
We got beer.
Whoo!

41:59.767 --> 42:03.019
So that was weird what
you did in there, to him.

42:03.187 --> 42:04.229
What happened?

42:04.396 --> 42:07.232
I sucked his face for
like 2 seconds.

42:07.399 --> 42:09.651
Sucked his face?

42:09.818 --> 42:10.902
Purell me.

42:11.070 --> 42:12.403
Wow.

42:12.780 --> 42:15.156
That was a big sacrifice.

42:15.324 --> 42:18.910
I couldn't have done it.
I mean, before drinking the beer.

42:20.746 --> 42:22.664
I'd do 2 seconds.

42:26.585 --> 42:28.670
What? It isn't gay.
It isn't gay.

42:28.837 --> 42:31.089
It isn't gay.
It's not gay.

42:31.257 --> 42:33.174
It's within the
3-second rule.

42:33.676 --> 42:36.010
That's for food
dropped on the floor.

42:36.887 --> 42:39.180
Yeah, uh, whatever.

42:43.185 --> 42:44.852
She's not Beth Cooper.

43:13.549 --> 43:14.799
Indians.

43:16.719 --> 43:21.139
It's Jack Nicholson, Easy Rider,
1969, directed by Dennis Hopper.

43:21.557 --> 43:24.017
Something is really wrong with you.

43:24.310 --> 43:25.351
Yeah.

43:27.605 --> 43:30.940
To old D.H. Lawrence.

43:33.694 --> 43:35.069
Hey.

44:06.477 --> 44:07.602
Sorry.

44:11.231 --> 44:13.775
Are you okay?
I'm sorry.

44:16.987 --> 44:18.738
Is that your tooth?

44:19.615 --> 44:21.115
It was deciduous.

44:21.617 --> 44:23.076
You still have baby teeth?

44:23.243 --> 44:24.702
Only 3.

44:24.870 --> 44:26.871
Now... 2.

44:27.039 --> 44:29.374
I have 2.
For your pillow.

44:29.541 --> 44:30.583
Thank you.

44:33.837 --> 44:37.757
How did that get on there?
I don't... I didn't even put...

44:37.925 --> 44:39.300
Rich, did you put this on?

44:40.427 --> 44:41.928
Leave it.

44:51.063 --> 44:52.814
I have to pee.

44:52.981 --> 44:54.774
Me too.

44:57.820 --> 45:00.238
Ah. Me trice.

45:07.996 --> 45:10.665
You know, I was
named after this song.

45:11.834 --> 45:13.835
You were named after a Kiss song?

45:14.002 --> 45:15.461
Yes.

45:16.463 --> 45:20.341
My parents were headbangers.

45:20.509 --> 45:23.428
Whoa.
Still kind of are.

45:24.471 --> 45:27.849
Beth Cooper's parents.
Taking in a Kiss show.

45:28.016 --> 45:33.312
Oh, man. That is so... cool.

45:34.857 --> 45:36.190
It's cool.

45:36.358 --> 45:40.528
You got headbangers parents.
That's awesome.

45:43.031 --> 45:44.240
Hm.

45:46.243 --> 45:48.286
Why are we walking?

45:48.537 --> 45:52.081
When I get my own car, I am
never walking anywhere again.

45:52.249 --> 45:54.208
My dad was gonna
give me his old car...

45:54.376 --> 45:58.212
...but then my stepmom bitch
Tricia crashed hers.

45:58.380 --> 46:01.215
Well, that's what you get
for splitting your parents up.

46:01.383 --> 46:03.134
Mean, mean!

46:03.302 --> 46:06.387
Never admit your
innermost fears to Cammy.

46:06.764 --> 46:08.723
Oh, my God.

46:08.891 --> 46:10.683
What?
Cows.

46:11.518 --> 46:13.144
Let's tip one.

46:13.312 --> 46:15.646
What, isn't that like
an urban legend?

46:16.106 --> 46:18.733
Why don't you go
find out?

46:19.234 --> 46:21.277
Me?
It was your idea.

46:21.445 --> 46:22.904
You're the guy.

46:23.071 --> 46:24.822
More or less.

46:25.157 --> 46:26.199
Go, go, go.

46:26.366 --> 46:30.036
Okay, that's really nice. Okay.
Ew. Ew. Ew.

46:30.204 --> 46:31.245
Okay.

46:31.413 --> 46:34.081
Shh. Could you just: Shh.

46:34.249 --> 46:37.585
This is the one.
Go. Shut up.

46:37.753 --> 46:39.837
Hey, okay.
Ew. Okay.

46:41.215 --> 46:43.174
Whoa. What's that kind of...?
That's like a noise.

46:43.342 --> 46:44.967
It's a moo, okay?
Push it.

46:45.135 --> 46:47.261
Where?
In the middle.

46:47.429 --> 46:48.513
Okay, push.

46:48.680 --> 46:50.640
Oh, shit.

46:52.434 --> 46:53.935
Do not laugh.

47:00.067 --> 47:01.776
So, what are
you thinking?

47:03.487 --> 47:05.196
Nothing.

47:05.989 --> 47:09.116
So, what are you
doing after graduation?

47:09.409 --> 47:10.451
I was gonna...

47:10.619 --> 47:14.705
They got this, like, pre-med
med-school thing at Stanford and...

47:15.415 --> 47:17.500
Good luck with that.

47:21.755 --> 47:23.756
So, what are your plans?

47:24.299 --> 47:28.261
I don't know. Maybe go to old
Harpers Community College.

47:28.637 --> 47:30.263
Harpers.

47:30.639 --> 47:32.139
Yeah, no, cool.

47:32.307 --> 47:37.144
They got a lot of
good credit courses.

47:37.646 --> 47:40.106
Maybe. If I can afford it.

47:46.196 --> 47:48.656
So I'm not Beth Cooper, huh?

47:49.867 --> 47:50.908
You heard that?

47:54.705 --> 48:00.209
Look, what I only meant was,
you didn't seem like...

48:00.377 --> 48:02.336
The Beth Cooper
over your bed?

48:03.130 --> 48:05.840
Right. Her.

48:06.008 --> 48:08.551
She would never hook up
with some loser for a 12-pack.

48:08.719 --> 48:11.470
No, she wouldn't.

48:12.681 --> 48:15.224
And you don't have to.

48:18.186 --> 48:20.146
You're better than that.

48:39.374 --> 48:41.626
That's it.
I'm done.

48:41.793 --> 48:44.253
I'm going back. Thank you.

48:45.088 --> 48:46.464
You're welcome.

48:46.632 --> 48:47.757
Bye, cow!

48:51.720 --> 48:53.262
What's that sound?

48:56.725 --> 48:58.059
Cows.
Aah!

48:58.560 --> 49:01.395
Stampede!

49:06.234 --> 49:08.235
What the hell was that?

49:09.947 --> 49:12.073
Uh, sounded like a cow.

49:12.240 --> 49:15.952
No, that was no standard cow.

49:17.788 --> 49:21.082
Denis Cooverman.
Are you afraid of cows?

49:21.249 --> 49:23.751
Vaccaphobic? Course not.

49:26.088 --> 49:27.463
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

49:27.631 --> 49:29.006
What the hell?
What happened?

49:29.174 --> 49:30.508
God, it's so funny!

49:30.676 --> 49:31.926
A cow bit me!

49:32.094 --> 49:33.761
No, cows can't bite.

49:33.929 --> 49:35.763
Well, this one sure as shit could.

49:35.931 --> 49:37.890
No, no, no,
cows don't bite.

49:38.058 --> 49:41.435
We all know that they
lack upper incisors.

49:42.562 --> 49:43.938
You're useful.

49:44.773 --> 49:46.732
What is that smell?

49:47.234 --> 49:49.110
He pooped his shoes.

49:52.990 --> 49:56.158
Lose the shoes.
I paid for these shoes.

49:56.743 --> 49:59.954
Uh, you're not getting in
my car with those shoes on.

50:00.122 --> 50:02.415
They go, with you
in them or not.

50:06.294 --> 50:07.586
You pooped your shoes.

50:25.981 --> 50:27.481
Lights out.

50:47.878 --> 50:52.798
To the future! Whoo!

50:58.388 --> 51:01.057
Turn the headlights on now!
Please, please, please!

51:01.224 --> 51:02.349
Okay!

51:03.727 --> 51:05.853
There, you happy?

51:06.021 --> 51:07.271
Car!

51:20.368 --> 51:23.621
Sorry, I was unaware
I was emitting that.

51:39.221 --> 51:41.764
Mr. And Mrs. C?
Who?

51:43.016 --> 51:44.850
My mom and dad.

51:46.937 --> 51:50.648
Could be worse.
Could not be your mom.

51:52.275 --> 51:57.113
Well, thank you all
for a lovely evening...

51:58.281 --> 52:00.241
...but now I must die.

52:00.700 --> 52:04.245
You do not wanna talk to your dad
when he has his pants down.

52:06.581 --> 52:07.915
Yeah.

52:15.257 --> 52:16.674
Goddamn kids!

52:21.012 --> 52:22.221
Jeez!

52:22.389 --> 52:23.889
Sorry!

52:27.144 --> 52:28.561
Thank you.

52:29.020 --> 52:30.813
Shit my panties.

52:30.981 --> 52:33.899
This is Valli Wooley's house.
We can't go in here.

52:34.067 --> 52:35.651
Because you called her
a stuck-up bitch...

52:35.819 --> 52:37.278
...in front of the
whole school?

52:37.445 --> 52:38.487
Don't worry...

52:38.655 --> 52:40.364
...she's usually upstairs
with a guy by now.

52:40.532 --> 52:42.575
If she gives you shit,
go for her throat.

52:42.742 --> 52:43.951
She'll be protecting
her nose.

52:44.119 --> 52:46.620
Her nose was a
graduation present.

52:47.455 --> 52:48.455
Bitch.

52:50.250 --> 52:51.292
Hi!

52:51.459 --> 52:53.711
Ew. Don't say hi to her.
Ew.

52:53.879 --> 52:56.005
Drinks by the pool!

53:07.350 --> 53:11.270
Hey, what is that?
It's nice. Is it salmon-colored?

53:15.525 --> 53:16.817
Sorry.

53:28.330 --> 53:29.747
Your party was better.

53:48.600 --> 53:49.642
What?

53:54.522 --> 53:56.690
I'm gonna go find a bathroom.

54:18.880 --> 54:20.214
Okay.

54:21.216 --> 54:22.508
Don't move.

54:22.676 --> 54:26.011
All right, yes, fine, all right.

54:28.098 --> 54:29.890
Oh, Greg.

54:31.017 --> 54:34.144
Well, if anybody's
gonna kill me tonight...

54:34.312 --> 54:35.896
...it should be you,
you deserve it.

54:36.064 --> 54:37.564
You've earned it.

54:40.694 --> 54:42.236
How did you know?

54:44.239 --> 54:45.614
How did you?

55:07.846 --> 55:09.263
Did I do that?

55:09.514 --> 55:13.309
This? No, it's not one of yours.

55:13.727 --> 55:15.269
It was an accident.

55:15.437 --> 55:19.606
You know, sometimes,
I don't even remember doing it.

55:21.109 --> 55:22.651
I just black out.

55:24.279 --> 55:26.280
I'd have that looked at, Greg.

55:26.823 --> 55:28.198
Yeah.

55:32.245 --> 55:36.415
Maybe I could call you sometime?
We could talk about it?

55:36.958 --> 55:38.208
Sure.

55:39.961 --> 55:42.588
Maybe a trained professional
would be better.

55:42.756 --> 55:45.424
I'm just thinking aloud here.

55:47.344 --> 55:50.137
But can I get a hug?
I mean, hugs are good.

55:51.389 --> 55:53.307
You do what you need to do, Greg.

55:57.103 --> 55:58.479
All right.

56:01.900 --> 56:05.486
Forget the tears we've cried

56:07.197 --> 56:10.824
Forget the good times too

56:13.370 --> 56:17.331
Forget the pain inside

56:19.459 --> 56:24.713
I will be there waiting for you

56:25.090 --> 56:27.674
Thanks, Denis.
Thanks a lot. Thanks.

56:32.680 --> 56:34.098
Rich!

56:34.391 --> 56:36.850
Le Coove! Here.
Thank you.

56:37.018 --> 56:38.936
Check it out.
Coach Raupp.

56:40.146 --> 56:41.438
Pedophilia.

56:42.440 --> 56:44.733
It's always
the gym teachers.

56:47.529 --> 56:49.738
You know they call us
Dick Munch and the Penis?

56:49.906 --> 56:51.031
Yeah.

56:51.199 --> 56:54.535
I mean, like, together, like we're
like the gaynamic duo or something.

56:55.995 --> 56:58.038
Where's Beth?
Wherever.

56:59.124 --> 57:00.749
I told you that speech
was a good idea.

57:00.917 --> 57:02.126
What are you talking about?

57:02.293 --> 57:05.045
What about what's happened tonight
could be construed as good?

57:05.213 --> 57:07.131
Closure. If you didn't
give that speech...

57:07.298 --> 57:09.967
...you'd never know what a
scary wack job Beth Cooper was.

57:10.135 --> 57:12.886
No other girl would ever live up
to her mythic proportions.

57:13.054 --> 57:17.433
She's not a scary wack job.
She's not a wack job.

57:17.600 --> 57:20.018
Dude, don't backpedal,
you know. Onwards!

57:21.396 --> 57:24.648
Your new hopeless obsession
might be at this very party.

57:25.358 --> 57:26.692
Denny!

57:26.860 --> 57:28.444
Oh, secret shame.

57:28.611 --> 57:29.653
This is so great.

57:29.821 --> 57:31.905
I didn't expect
to see you here.

57:33.408 --> 57:34.741
Patty.

57:35.702 --> 57:40.581
I loved your speech. You said
some very perceptive things.

57:40.790 --> 57:43.917
Richard, do you know Victoria?

57:44.085 --> 57:47.880
Yes, certainamente.
You, uh, lost weight, Tori.

57:49.174 --> 57:51.508
You're not wearing shoes.

57:52.427 --> 57:54.219
Nobody wears shoes anymore.

57:54.387 --> 57:56.680
Denny,
what happened to your poor face?

57:57.056 --> 57:58.807
Greg Saloga beat you up,
I bet.

57:58.975 --> 58:01.768
Or Valli Wooley, she paid
someone to beat you up?

58:01.936 --> 58:06.273
No, the Coove had a little dust-up
with Beth Cooper's boyfriend.

58:06.566 --> 58:09.067
Beth Cooper?
Yeah, ex-boyfriend actually.

58:09.235 --> 58:13.113
Army, dark ops, couldn't stand the
idea of the Coove here and Beth...

58:13.281 --> 58:14.990
...so it went to blows.

58:15.158 --> 58:19.036
I mean, you think this is bad,
you should see the other guy.

58:19.204 --> 58:22.122
Yeah, I mean, I feel bad for him.

58:22.290 --> 58:25.334
He's in the hospital,
all beaten up and shit.

58:25.502 --> 58:28.045
To tell you the truth,
I just hope he's okay.

58:28.213 --> 58:29.338
Me too.

58:29.506 --> 58:32.508
Actually, he's upstairs.

58:33.593 --> 58:35.719
Um, whoa, uh...

58:35.887 --> 58:37.804
Right, look at the time here.

58:37.972 --> 58:42.142
My female fiancee's getting off
her shift at Hooters, so...

58:42.310 --> 58:45.395
Wow, you know, but this has been
a pleasure, ladies, so...

58:45.563 --> 58:48.273
Good luck!
It was nice seeing you!

58:49.234 --> 58:50.442
Bye!

58:51.819 --> 58:53.070
Sorry.

58:53.488 --> 58:55.656
Where are you going?
We gotta get out of here.

58:55.823 --> 58:57.241
Asshole!

58:57.408 --> 58:58.659
What are you doing here?

59:01.329 --> 59:02.496
Don't.

59:13.383 --> 59:15.467
So we meet again.

59:15.760 --> 59:20.931
Really? Ernst Blofeld in just
like every Bond movie. Oh, okay.

59:21.099 --> 59:22.391
Kevin, just stop.

59:24.018 --> 59:25.561
Get out of here.

59:26.145 --> 59:28.772
And get yourself tested
for gonorrhea.

59:29.816 --> 59:35.195
Why don't you get that tight, pretty
butt of yours in my vehicle, all right?

59:36.656 --> 59:38.031
Move out!

59:45.832 --> 59:47.249
Are you okay?

59:51.087 --> 59:52.421
Stay here.

59:54.966 --> 59:56.383
Clear out!

01:00:02.974 --> 01:00:05.475
I am not your plaything!

01:00:07.895 --> 01:00:12.065
No, no, come on! Come on, people!
Are you just gonna let him murder me?

01:00:12.233 --> 01:00:13.275
Wait!

01:00:17.905 --> 01:00:20.365
I am not worthless, okay?

01:00:20.533 --> 01:00:24.578
Look at this party.
Look at all my friends.

01:00:25.246 --> 01:00:27.205
Cause brain damage.

01:00:29.125 --> 01:00:31.501
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:00:31.669 --> 01:00:33.086
Thank God, Coach Raupp.

01:00:33.254 --> 01:00:34.630
Ladies.

01:00:35.298 --> 01:00:36.632
Some ground rules.

01:00:36.799 --> 01:00:40.010
You're not gonna stop it?
Look, all I want is a fair fight.

01:00:40.178 --> 01:00:43.263
Fair fight? Look at his arms,
they're like redwoods.

01:00:43.431 --> 01:00:44.848
Yeah. Aren't they great?

01:00:45.016 --> 01:00:46.767
Okay. Pretty simple.

01:00:46.934 --> 01:00:51.438
No biting, scratching, hair-pulling.
None of that sissy stuff, okay?

01:00:51.606 --> 01:00:53.065
Headbutt?
Definitely.

01:00:53.232 --> 01:00:56.735
And remember, once your
opponent loses consciousness...

01:00:56.903 --> 01:00:58.278
...the beating is over.

01:00:58.446 --> 01:00:59.905
Okay?

01:01:00.073 --> 01:01:01.239
And...

01:01:01.783 --> 01:01:02.991
...fight.

01:01:06.788 --> 01:01:08.622
Cooverman, Bison pride.

01:01:09.248 --> 01:01:11.083
No, I'm not gonna fight him.

01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:13.877
Don't be such a pussy, pussy.
Come on.

01:01:14.170 --> 01:01:17.839
Look, Kevin,
you've won, okay?

01:01:18.007 --> 01:01:19.257
You got the girl...

01:01:19.425 --> 01:01:22.094
...you've humiliated me
in front of all my peers.

01:01:22.261 --> 01:01:26.181
I apologize and surrender
unconditionally.

01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:30.894
Denis.

01:01:31.062 --> 01:01:32.562
Denny, your face.

01:01:32.730 --> 01:01:36.817
Wow. Ha, ha. Oh, man!
That was great.

01:01:36.984 --> 01:01:38.527
Are you okay?

01:01:39.278 --> 01:01:40.320
Get up!

01:01:41.906 --> 01:01:43.824
You can take him.
No, no.

01:01:43.991 --> 01:01:45.158
You can do this.

01:01:45.785 --> 01:01:48.161
Get up! Come on.

01:01:48.663 --> 01:01:50.539
Hey!

01:01:50.707 --> 01:01:51.873
Leave my friend alone!

01:01:56.462 --> 01:01:57.504
Let's get him.

01:02:01.843 --> 01:02:03.927
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Timeout, Salo...

01:02:10.184 --> 01:02:11.893
That all you got, son, huh?

01:02:26.159 --> 01:02:28.869
Now, Denis, where were we?

01:02:52.226 --> 01:02:53.977
Denis Cooverman.

01:02:57.231 --> 01:02:58.398
Come on.

01:03:01.652 --> 01:03:03.445
Where do you
think you're going?

01:03:07.825 --> 01:03:09.910
Okay, time to get
in the car! Get in the car.

01:03:10.411 --> 01:03:13.079
Denis! Come on.

01:03:19.253 --> 01:03:20.504
Watch it!

01:03:29.931 --> 01:03:32.766
Do you know how many laws
you just broke?

01:03:32.934 --> 01:03:35.268
Grand theft auto,
criminal destruction of property...

01:03:35.436 --> 01:03:38.063
...assault with a deadly weapon,
aggravated battery...

01:03:38.231 --> 01:03:42.400
...leaving the scene of an accident,
speeding, and now failure to stop!

01:03:42.568 --> 01:03:46.196
That's 7, at least!
That's a new record!

01:03:46.364 --> 01:03:48.448
I don't think that's
a record.

01:03:48.616 --> 01:03:50.283
I think you should pull over.

01:03:50.451 --> 01:03:51.618
Pull over, Beth.
Ha.

01:03:51.953 --> 01:03:54.037
Hey, how about this?
How about:

01:03:54.205 --> 01:03:58.041
"Thank you. Thank you, Beth,
for saving my life again?"

01:03:58.209 --> 01:04:01.545
Saving my life? Saving my...?

01:04:02.129 --> 01:04:05.090
You're the one who almost ran
over me with a military vehicle...

01:04:05.258 --> 01:04:07.968
...owned by some homicidal
rage ape you call a boyfriend...

01:04:08.135 --> 01:04:09.970
...who's been trying
to kill me all night!

01:04:10.137 --> 01:04:12.264
You're spitting your blood
at me! Pbbt.

01:04:12.431 --> 01:04:15.016
You're supposed to keep
your bodily fluids to yourself.

01:04:15.184 --> 01:04:19.855
You know what?
This is not fun anymore.

01:04:21.941 --> 01:04:24.109
Who said it's supposed
to be fun?

01:04:43.671 --> 01:04:45.463
Everybody out.

01:04:49.802 --> 01:04:52.971
Uh-uh. No, no, no.
What are we doing here?

01:04:53.139 --> 01:04:54.639
I have a key to the school.

01:04:54.807 --> 01:04:56.433
You have a key to the school.

01:04:56.601 --> 01:04:59.853
Head cheerleader is a position
of trust and responsibility.

01:05:00.021 --> 01:05:02.480
Heh, heh. Fools.
Ha, ha, ha.

01:05:08.863 --> 01:05:12.365
Come on, Denis. This is the least
illegal thing we've done all night.

01:05:12.533 --> 01:05:14.367
Sit. You'll enjoy it.

01:05:19.874 --> 01:05:21.750
Ready, girls?
Yes.

01:05:21.918 --> 01:05:24.252
5, 6, 7, 8!

01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:27.380
Are you ready?
Ready for the best

01:05:27.548 --> 01:05:30.759
B-G, number one
Oh, yeah, nothing less

01:05:30.927 --> 01:05:33.553
5, 6, 7, 8!

01:05:33.721 --> 01:05:36.890
We're going to the top
We can't be stopped

01:05:37.058 --> 01:05:39.392
Come on, girls
Yell yellow!

01:05:39.810 --> 01:05:41.144
Yellow.

01:05:41.312 --> 01:05:42.520
Yell blue!

01:05:42.688 --> 01:05:43.939
Blue!

01:05:44.315 --> 01:05:47.275
Mighty Bisons
Oh, yeah, let's fight

01:05:47.443 --> 01:05:50.236
Ready and slow it down.

01:05:50.404 --> 01:05:54.407
Can you feel it? What?
Can you feel the heat?

01:05:54.575 --> 01:05:58.203
Yellow and blue
Oh, yeah, how sweet

01:05:58.496 --> 01:06:01.164
Ready and last time

01:06:01.332 --> 01:06:04.709
With spirit and spark
We steal the show

01:06:04.877 --> 01:06:08.254
Mighty Bisons, kiss, kiss
Gotta go!

01:06:08.422 --> 01:06:09.965
Yeah!

01:06:32.196 --> 01:06:34.114
Let's hit the showers.

01:06:34.281 --> 01:06:37.283
Showers! Showers!
Yay!

01:06:38.285 --> 01:06:40.704
Let's go! Come on, hurry!
Showers!

01:06:51.424 --> 01:06:53.758
They're hitting the showers.
Yeah.

01:06:53.926 --> 01:06:55.218
Come on!

01:06:55.386 --> 01:06:58.221
I... l... I'd love to. I just, um...

01:06:58.389 --> 01:07:01.808
I don't think we were invited.
Uh, I'm pretty sure we were.

01:07:04.145 --> 01:07:06.479
You know, Rich...

01:07:07.732 --> 01:07:10.150
...you don't have to prove anything.

01:07:33.174 --> 01:07:34.758
Some woman.

01:07:36.218 --> 01:07:37.594
Oh, yeah.

01:07:38.512 --> 01:07:41.848
I said yes, immediately.
I was like...

01:07:43.601 --> 01:07:45.518
Sorry.
Denis.

01:07:50.357 --> 01:07:52.025
Don't be shy.

01:08:01.535 --> 01:08:02.827
God.

01:08:03.037 --> 01:08:04.370
Oh.

01:08:08.876 --> 01:08:11.628
Hey, space boy.
Come get wet.

01:08:17.885 --> 01:08:20.386
That invitation
good enough for you?

01:08:21.388 --> 01:08:24.015
I just don't think we should be...

01:08:24.183 --> 01:08:26.893
Stop! Stop thinking
with your brain, dude.

01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:31.272
I don't wanna ruin anything.
There's nothing left to ruin!

01:08:31.439 --> 01:08:33.733
You know, except maybe this.

01:08:33.901 --> 01:08:36.736
And this, my friend,
is a rare occasion.

01:08:36.904 --> 01:08:38.904
Chances like this don't
come along every day.

01:08:39.073 --> 01:08:40.573
In fact,
they never come along.

01:08:40.741 --> 01:08:42.242
This does not happen!

01:08:42.408 --> 01:08:44.243
Are you guys coming?

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:50.875
"Carpe diem. Seize the day, boys.
Make your lives extraordinary."

01:08:51.042 --> 01:08:53.670
Robin Williams, and your dad.

01:08:55.589 --> 01:09:00.385
I'm just trying to make it
through the night alive, okay?

01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:02.970
You're not alive unless you're living.

01:09:05.265 --> 01:09:06.432
Who said that?

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:10.103
I think I did.

01:09:13.566 --> 01:09:15.774
"Here's Johnny!"

01:09:30.082 --> 01:09:32.500
Carpe diem.

01:09:50.477 --> 01:09:51.810
Beth.

01:09:52.854 --> 01:09:56.149
Gotta tell you, you're in for a treat.

01:09:56.317 --> 01:09:59.986
Been reading a few
of my mom's ladies magazines...

01:10:00.154 --> 01:10:04.324
...and they've got a couple secrets
on how to ultimately pleasure you.

01:10:16.212 --> 01:10:19.547
How did you find us?!
LoJack, dipshit.

01:10:19.715 --> 01:10:21.758
Man of war!

01:10:22.718 --> 01:10:25.386
Taste my wet blade.

01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:36.022
Come on! Get your stuff!
Go!

01:10:36.190 --> 01:10:39.025
Are you sure?
I can handle these three.

01:10:40.402 --> 01:10:43.279
I've been preparing for this
all my life.

01:10:43.572 --> 01:10:45.740
Help! Help!

01:10:55.626 --> 01:10:57.710
Come on, let's get out of here.

01:11:05.219 --> 01:11:06.844
Never again.

01:11:14.603 --> 01:11:15.937
Yes!

01:11:40.921 --> 01:11:43.589
Come on, hurry up!
I'm trying, stop moving!

01:11:43.757 --> 01:11:45.842
What happened to your pants?

01:11:46.010 --> 01:11:47.927
Your boyfriend has them.

01:11:48.095 --> 01:11:50.388
Okay, we gotta go, come on.
Get your stuff!

01:11:50.556 --> 01:11:52.265
Come on, come on, come on!

01:11:57.688 --> 01:12:01.607
Aw, how sweet.
Kevin brought back my car.

01:12:01.775 --> 01:12:02.942
Come on!

01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:04.360
Hey, what about Rich?

01:12:31.638 --> 01:12:35.141
Yah! Is that all you've got?

01:12:35.309 --> 01:12:37.894
Oh. Oh, one more?

01:12:39.897 --> 01:12:42.190
Ha, ha, ha. Classic.

01:12:51.158 --> 01:12:52.909
Guys!
Rich!

01:12:53.077 --> 01:12:56.079
Rich, I got your clothes.
Hurry up.

01:12:58.165 --> 01:13:00.875
Yah!
Come on, come on, come on!

01:13:01.043 --> 01:13:02.835
Okay, go, go.

01:13:10.469 --> 01:13:12.512
Goddamn truck drivers.

01:13:12.679 --> 01:13:14.180
Where are we going?

01:13:14.556 --> 01:13:16.516
We can go to
my dad's cabin.

01:13:16.683 --> 01:13:20.353
I can go there anytime I want as
long as I don't tell Mom where it is.

01:13:20.896 --> 01:13:24.107
You know what, I just, um...
I wanna go home.

01:13:24.274 --> 01:13:26.692
You know, you're the one
who started this.

01:13:27.736 --> 01:13:28.945
Me?

01:13:29.113 --> 01:13:30.947
Yeah, you.

01:13:31.115 --> 01:13:34.325
You're the geek who, in front of the
entire school, our friends and family...

01:13:34.493 --> 01:13:37.495
...declared your love for someone
you don't know a thing about.

01:13:37.788 --> 01:13:40.373
He knows a lot about you.
Quiz him.

01:13:41.583 --> 01:13:45.795
He knows your locker combo.
He knows your favorite anti-perspirant.

01:13:46.296 --> 01:13:48.047
He knows your blood type.

01:13:48.215 --> 01:13:52.760
Okay, I hate to remind you this,
Beth, but you said it was sweet.

01:13:53.971 --> 01:13:57.849
You did. Oh, my God,
and you came to my house.

01:13:58.016 --> 01:14:01.269
If you didn't think it was sweet,
why would you come to my house?

01:14:01.437 --> 01:14:03.062
What do you think,
super genius?

01:14:03.230 --> 01:14:04.689
We thought
it would be funny.

01:14:09.153 --> 01:14:10.987
Oh. Okay.

01:14:15.534 --> 01:14:19.120
Are you just gonna keep bleeding?
Yeah, for about 3 days.

01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:21.747
Just put your head back.

01:14:22.875 --> 01:14:25.751
Now it's dripping down my throat.
Here.

01:14:25.919 --> 01:14:28.796
Stick these up there.
They're super absorbent.

01:14:51.612 --> 01:14:55.740
Listen,
about what Cammy said before.

01:14:56.158 --> 01:14:58.493
She thought it would be funny.

01:15:00.287 --> 01:15:04.790
I mean, we all thought
it would be a fun thing to do.

01:15:07.419 --> 01:15:10.087
Guess I did think
it would be a little funny.

01:15:12.132 --> 01:15:13.508
I'm sorry.

01:15:15.636 --> 01:15:18.179
Guys tell me they love me
all the time.

01:15:18.597 --> 01:15:21.724
And it's usually because
they want something.

01:15:24.228 --> 01:15:27.813
Well, it was kind of funny,
right?

01:15:29.691 --> 01:15:30.858
Ha, ha, ha.

01:15:32.945 --> 01:15:36.113
Please, take those out now.
Your wish.

01:15:44.039 --> 01:15:45.873
Can I say something personal?

01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:47.542
Sure.

01:15:48.502 --> 01:15:50.503
You smell like
a dead homeless guy.

01:15:52.339 --> 01:15:56.175
Yeah, it's probably my shirt.
There's hummus.

01:15:56.426 --> 01:15:57.885
Take it off.

01:15:58.095 --> 01:16:00.513
Oh, no, I can leave it on,
it's fine.

01:16:00.931 --> 01:16:03.849
I'm not gonna molest you.
Take it off.

01:16:06.645 --> 01:16:08.938
Take it off,
take it off.

01:16:17.281 --> 01:16:19.699
Let me just air it out a little.

01:16:20.450 --> 01:16:22.159
Oh, shit!

01:16:28.083 --> 01:16:29.292
Sorry.

01:16:40.804 --> 01:16:44.223
Okay, it was somewhere
around here. You can stop.

01:16:53.734 --> 01:16:56.110
Oh, my God. What?

01:16:58.113 --> 01:16:59.947
Really? Dude.

01:17:01.617 --> 01:17:03.576
I think those are
his lucky underpants.

01:17:07.414 --> 01:17:09.123
Give me my poncho.

01:17:10.417 --> 01:17:12.418
Give me my poncho.
Oh, my God.

01:17:13.211 --> 01:17:16.088
What are you doing?
You're so mean.

01:17:16.256 --> 01:17:17.590
What?

01:17:17.758 --> 01:17:19.675
Actually, I got these as a gag gift...

01:17:19.843 --> 01:17:22.094
...so it's appropriate
that you're laughing.

01:17:22.262 --> 01:17:26.098
No, it's good, I'm happy that you're...
You guys got the joke! Good one.

01:17:26.266 --> 01:17:28.643
Get in here.
No, purple's not really my color.

01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:32.188
It's fuchsia and it's
my favorite color. Sorry.

01:17:32.356 --> 01:17:33.939
That's fine.
Okay.

01:17:34.107 --> 01:17:35.816
There we go.
All better.

01:17:35.984 --> 01:17:38.778
How do I look? Good?
Great.

01:17:42.699 --> 01:17:45.868
Ha, ha, ha.
That pink poncho's sort of cute.

01:17:46.703 --> 01:17:47.828
What?

01:17:49.039 --> 01:17:50.498
Goddamn Kevin.

01:17:50.666 --> 01:17:54.460
Because of you I am in the middle
of nowhere looking for a shirt.

01:17:54.628 --> 01:17:57.755
Oh, yeah, no,
goddamn that Kevin.

01:17:59.466 --> 01:18:01.467
Why do you even go out
with him, anyway?

01:18:02.427 --> 01:18:06.681
In the beginning, he was sweet.
He made me laugh.

01:18:07.307 --> 01:18:10.559
And when he smiled...
He was really hot.

01:18:13.021 --> 01:18:14.480
I don't know.

01:18:14.648 --> 01:18:19.568
Guess it was the way other girls
looked at me when I was with him.

01:18:20.195 --> 01:18:21.821
I felt proud.

01:18:22.322 --> 01:18:27.993
Thought I was the lucky girl
this big, strong Army guy chose.

01:18:28.495 --> 01:18:30.329
It didn't bother you
that he was an a...?

01:18:30.497 --> 01:18:31.539
An asshole?

01:18:31.707 --> 01:18:33.416
Yeah.

01:18:33.917 --> 01:18:37.169
I just made excuses
for him because...

01:18:39.089 --> 01:18:41.340
...it was nice to feel wanted.

01:18:41.675 --> 01:18:43.426
See, I don't get that...

01:18:43.593 --> 01:18:47.513
...because there are so many guys
who would love to be with you.

01:18:47.681 --> 01:18:50.641
Yeah. For a night, maybe.

01:18:54.688 --> 01:18:58.315
So why did you do it?
The speech?

01:18:59.234 --> 01:19:00.693
I don't know.

01:19:01.528 --> 01:19:02.945
It's just...

01:19:04.239 --> 01:19:06.532
You're the
head cheerleader...

01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:08.534
...and I'm the captain
of the debate team.

01:19:08.702 --> 01:19:13.289
And I know it's ridiculous to think
that you and me would even...

01:19:16.126 --> 01:19:18.502
I guess I just wanted
to talk to you.

01:19:20.756 --> 01:19:23.507
And I never did,
and then I realized...

01:19:24.885 --> 01:19:27.428
...that was my last chance,
you know?

01:19:29.431 --> 01:19:31.307
Well, I'm glad you did.

01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:38.314
Look! Your shirt.

01:19:39.858 --> 01:19:43.068
Oh, uh, um...

01:19:47.073 --> 01:19:48.407
Oh.

01:19:49.534 --> 01:19:50.868
Aw.

01:19:51.119 --> 01:19:54.246
Hi! Oh, you're so cute!
Hi, little fella.

01:19:54.581 --> 01:19:57.833
Hey, no. No, that's not food.
Hi, cutie!

01:19:58.001 --> 01:20:00.252
That's my shirt.
Okay, so just, uh...

01:20:09.554 --> 01:20:10.721
He looked at me!

01:20:10.889 --> 01:20:14.016
He looked right at me!
He's gonna eat me!

01:20:23.318 --> 01:20:25.820
Whoo! Party!

01:20:39.376 --> 01:20:41.043
Smells like death
in here.

01:20:41.211 --> 01:20:45.589
My dad just bought all this stuff.
He's never killed anything.

01:20:45.757 --> 01:20:47.883
They are kind of cute, huh?
Rawr.

01:20:48.969 --> 01:20:51.136
Dude,
you look ridiculous.

01:20:51.304 --> 01:20:53.472
Well, what am I supposed
to do? I don't...

01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:54.682
Treece, darling...

01:20:54.850 --> 01:20:57.017
would you get this lovely
lady something to wear?

01:20:57.185 --> 01:20:58.561
Yeah, try the bedroom.

01:20:58.812 --> 01:21:00.646
Okay, who wants a drink?

01:21:00.814 --> 01:21:03.148
I do, please.
I want one.

01:21:03.984 --> 01:21:05.609
Vodka! Hee, hee.

01:21:14.494 --> 01:21:16.161
Okay, a toast.

01:21:16.621 --> 01:21:19.707
You know what's weird?
I didn't give this to him.

01:21:20.584 --> 01:21:25.170
Anyway, to the world's
greatest night.

01:21:25.338 --> 01:21:27.172
Yeah.
Whoo!

01:21:36.016 --> 01:21:38.809
Wow.
Look, it's almost morning.

01:21:40.145 --> 01:21:43.355
Does anyone wanna come
watch the sunrise with me?

01:21:44.190 --> 01:21:45.482
Yeah.

01:21:59.164 --> 01:22:00.831
Hey.

01:22:01.917 --> 01:22:04.001
Hey, can I ask
you something?

01:22:04.669 --> 01:22:05.878
What?

01:22:06.296 --> 01:22:08.464
It's about
your brother.

01:22:10.133 --> 01:22:11.550
What about him?

01:22:12.719 --> 01:22:14.637
What was
his name?

01:22:15.805 --> 01:22:17.139
David.

01:22:18.558 --> 01:22:20.059
What was he like?

01:22:21.478 --> 01:22:24.188
He was already sick
when I was born.

01:22:24.564 --> 01:22:27.650
Died when I was 2.
He was 12.

01:22:28.902 --> 01:22:31.070
I don't remember him
at all.

01:22:31.571 --> 01:22:35.699
There's this picture of me
visiting him at the hospital...

01:22:35.867 --> 01:22:39.119
...and it's like he's
just some sick kid.

01:22:39.287 --> 01:22:44.083
It's the big, dramatic tragedy
of my life, and I wasn't even there.

01:22:44.709 --> 01:22:47.795
Yeah, but you were there.

01:22:48.338 --> 01:22:51.048
I mean, maybe
you don't remember...

01:22:51.758 --> 01:22:53.592
...but I'll bet it
meant a lot to him.

01:22:54.427 --> 01:22:57.388
Thank you.
That was very sweet.

01:23:07.273 --> 01:23:09.608
"Say hello to my little friend!"

01:23:09.776 --> 01:23:11.443
Ha, ha, ha.
Wow.

01:23:11.611 --> 01:23:12.903
What?

01:23:13.071 --> 01:23:16.532
Scarface. Pacino,
'82, De Palma.

01:23:18.576 --> 01:23:19.868
Look.

01:23:24.624 --> 01:23:27.918
"Fill your hands,
you son of a bitch!"

01:23:32.465 --> 01:23:33.507
What?

01:23:35.343 --> 01:23:39.304
It's John Wayne.
It's John Wayne, 1969, True Grit.

01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:42.641
Oh, my God!
I peed, I peed, I peed!

01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:47.646
No, it's not...
It's not that funny.

01:23:47.814 --> 01:23:50.566
No, it is, because you...

01:23:53.695 --> 01:23:55.487
Why, because you think I'm gay?

01:23:58.324 --> 01:23:59.700
You think incorrectly.

01:23:59.868 --> 01:24:02.661
The lady doth protest
too much, methinks.

01:24:02.829 --> 01:24:03.871
What?

01:24:04.414 --> 01:24:06.165
Like you know Shakespeare.

01:24:06.833 --> 01:24:10.085
Queen Gertrude to
Hamlet, Act III, Scene 2...

01:24:10.253 --> 01:24:14.506
...1602, William Shakespeare,
or possibly Edward de Vere.

01:24:15.216 --> 01:24:16.550
Wow.

01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:18.177
That's... Wow.

01:24:18.344 --> 01:24:20.012
Yeah.

01:24:22.182 --> 01:24:24.266
Wow, look at the sun.

01:24:24.434 --> 01:24:26.268
It's so big
and pretty.

01:24:26.436 --> 01:24:29.021
Well, that's an optical illusion.

01:24:29.189 --> 01:24:31.857
There are certain things
that appear larger...

01:24:32.025 --> 01:24:34.568
...in context to the objects
around them.

01:24:36.571 --> 01:24:38.989
You know everything,
Denis Cooverman.

01:24:39.449 --> 01:24:43.702
No, no, not everything.
There are some things I don't know.

01:24:44.287 --> 01:24:45.996
Multiple things.

01:24:46.539 --> 01:24:49.958
Well, I'll tell you one thing
you know nothing about.

01:24:50.126 --> 01:24:52.961
When a girl says the
sunrise is big or pretty...

01:24:53.129 --> 01:24:54.546
...you know what you say?

01:24:55.673 --> 01:24:58.050
Not what I said,
presumably?

01:24:58.218 --> 01:24:59.510
You don't say anything.

01:24:59.677 --> 01:25:01.804
You just put your arm
around her.

01:25:05.934 --> 01:25:08.268
You know, just something
for future reference.

01:25:10.563 --> 01:25:14.024
For future reference,
I'll remember that.

01:25:19.739 --> 01:25:23.325
If you're not gay, why so
unchubby in the shower?

01:25:23.493 --> 01:25:26.954
Heh, heh, l...
I was just being cool.

01:25:27.122 --> 01:25:30.249
It was uncool
of you to notice.

01:25:30.875 --> 01:25:33.502
No 18-year-old boy
is that cool.

01:25:33.670 --> 01:25:36.505
I am that cool.

01:25:37.590 --> 01:25:40.092
Nobody cares
if you're gay.

01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:43.262
I'm not.

01:25:43.429 --> 01:25:47.975
Nobody cares, so
just be gay already!

01:25:50.019 --> 01:25:54.439
You, Richard Munsch,
have never been with a woman.

01:25:54.983 --> 01:25:56.650
Never been
with one.

01:25:56.818 --> 01:25:58.235
Wha?

01:26:00.113 --> 01:26:01.446
Um...

01:26:12.041 --> 01:26:13.375
Watch...

01:26:13.543 --> 01:26:14.877
And learn.

01:26:19.674 --> 01:26:22.926
That's nice, it's nice. Yeah.

01:26:23.094 --> 01:26:25.137
You cool?
Uh...

01:26:25.305 --> 01:26:28.390
Long as everyone else
is cool.

01:26:30.435 --> 01:26:33.812
Hey, there is
my chest hair.

01:26:35.148 --> 01:26:37.482
Yeah, I'm liking that.
I am, uh...

01:26:39.944 --> 01:26:42.362
Yeah, definitely reacted
to that.

01:26:43.531 --> 01:26:44.865
Uh...

01:26:45.783 --> 01:26:49.077
Hey, this is, wow, great,
you know, really top-notch...

01:26:49.245 --> 01:26:53.207
...but I left my latex sheaths
back at the house, so...

01:26:53.374 --> 01:26:54.416
That's okay.

01:26:54.584 --> 01:26:56.001
Treece's got some,
don't you, Treece?

01:26:56.169 --> 01:26:57.669
I've got gobs.

01:26:57.837 --> 01:26:59.129
Gobs?

01:27:11.517 --> 01:27:15.020
Well, that
was expedient.

01:27:15.355 --> 01:27:17.856
But at least we know
you're not gay.

01:27:18.024 --> 01:27:21.235
Yeah, tell that to my dad.
What's his number?

01:27:28.284 --> 01:27:30.077
So do you
still love me?

01:27:30.912 --> 01:27:32.037
Yeah.

01:27:32.205 --> 01:27:35.040
Am I everything you've
ever masturbated to?

01:27:35.708 --> 01:27:37.793
No, it's not like that
with you.

01:27:37.961 --> 01:27:41.797
I mean, you're different
than I imagined.

01:27:42.382 --> 01:27:45.300
You're real.

01:27:46.469 --> 01:27:47.678
And scary.

01:27:49.222 --> 01:27:51.932
And exciting and fun.

01:27:52.183 --> 01:27:54.893
But I thought you said
this wasn't fun.

01:27:58.022 --> 01:28:01.066
All my memories from
high school are from tonight.

01:28:06.406 --> 01:28:08.198
You gotta get out more often.

01:28:08.992 --> 01:28:11.159
Yeah.
Yeah.

01:28:12.662 --> 01:28:14.371
Where are you
going to college?

01:28:14.539 --> 01:28:15.914
NYU.

01:28:16.916 --> 01:28:19.626
What are you majoring in?
Acting.

01:28:19.794 --> 01:28:22.296
Shut up. Shut up!
Mm-hm. Yeah.

01:28:22.463 --> 01:28:23.672
Me too.
Really?

01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:25.299
Yeah, and directing.
Wow.

01:28:25.925 --> 01:28:28.802
If you wanna be an actress,
why weren't you in Drama Club?

01:28:29.721 --> 01:28:32.806
Social survival.
That's a good call.

01:28:32.974 --> 01:28:34.641
Mm-hm.

01:28:34.809 --> 01:28:37.644
So who is your
favorite director?

01:28:37.812 --> 01:28:40.063
Hello,
it was a threesome.

01:28:41.774 --> 01:28:43.442
Wow.

01:28:44.777 --> 01:28:47.362
I know high school
wasn't great for you.

01:28:48.448 --> 01:28:50.198
No, it was...

01:28:51.284 --> 01:28:52.617
...completely awful.

01:28:55.496 --> 01:28:59.207
You see, the thing is,
high school was great for me.

01:29:00.626 --> 01:29:03.295
I had a great, great ride.

01:29:06.132 --> 01:29:07.799
And now it's over.

01:29:10.762 --> 01:29:14.389
You, you're gonna go off
and become a doctor...

01:29:14.557 --> 01:29:18.226
...and cure cancer or whatever
new diseases there are.

01:29:19.228 --> 01:29:20.604
But this?

01:29:22.523 --> 01:29:24.649
This is about it for me.

01:29:27.111 --> 01:29:31.031
Everything in my life from here
on out is just gonna be...

01:29:35.203 --> 01:29:36.703
...ordinary.

01:29:39.374 --> 01:29:40.665
Wow.

01:29:40.833 --> 01:29:44.086
That's such...

01:29:44.670 --> 01:29:46.296
...bullshit.

01:29:46.839 --> 01:29:48.173
Heh.

01:29:48.466 --> 01:29:50.509
Because the Beth Cooper
I know?

01:29:50.676 --> 01:29:53.512
The one that I now know...

01:29:53.679 --> 01:29:59.184
...is the most alive person
I've ever met.

01:30:01.646 --> 01:30:03.480
The Beth Cooper
I know...

01:30:03.648 --> 01:30:05.357
...she's not gonna have
an ordinary life.

01:30:05.525 --> 01:30:07.859
She's gonna have an amazing life.

01:30:08.027 --> 01:30:09.903
Slightly insane...

01:30:10.071 --> 01:30:12.989
...but never uninteresting...

01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:16.660
...always ass-kicking...

01:30:17.912 --> 01:30:19.204
...life.

01:30:20.206 --> 01:30:22.707
How do you know that?

01:30:24.043 --> 01:30:26.628
Because I'm a very smart guy.

01:30:42.478 --> 01:30:43.895
All right,
thank you very much.

01:30:44.063 --> 01:30:45.105
Any luck?

01:30:45.273 --> 01:30:47.732
No, they can't send anyone
out till next week.

01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:48.900
Explain this to me:

01:30:49.068 --> 01:30:50.986
How do you put a
microwave into the wall?

01:30:51.154 --> 01:30:52.737
God only knows.

01:30:52.905 --> 01:30:55.824
Oh, hi. I need to get
my kitchen repaired.

01:30:59.245 --> 01:31:01.788
Haven't I seen that car before?

01:31:03.082 --> 01:31:04.416
Oh!

01:31:04.584 --> 01:31:07.461
Denis!
What happened to you?

01:31:07.628 --> 01:31:09.838
I'm okay. I'm okay.

01:31:14.969 --> 01:31:18.680
I can't talk about this.
I'm gonna go make pancakes.

01:31:20.391 --> 01:31:22.851
Or did she already
make you breakfast?

01:31:26.481 --> 01:31:27.814
Wow.

01:31:30.485 --> 01:31:33.236
I talked to your dad, Rich.
Yeah?

01:31:33.404 --> 01:31:35.989
You might wanna hang out
here for the rest of the day.

01:31:36.157 --> 01:31:38.408
Okay.
And tomorrow.

01:31:38.576 --> 01:31:42.245
Okay.
You know, just until it's safe.

01:31:42.497 --> 01:31:44.331
Got it. Thanks.

01:31:48.127 --> 01:31:51.421
I hope you had fun.
I did.

01:31:52.965 --> 01:31:56.009
You know we have to
punish you, somehow?

01:31:56.177 --> 01:31:59.471
Yeah. Figured that.

01:31:59.639 --> 01:32:02.140
What do they do these days?
Do they still ground you?

01:32:02.308 --> 01:32:04.893
I don't even know.
I don't know either.

01:32:05.061 --> 01:32:06.478
But...

01:32:07.230 --> 01:32:10.982
...whatever it is,
it was worth it.

01:32:13.361 --> 01:32:15.111
Let's not tell
your mother that.

01:32:15.279 --> 01:32:16.530
Yeah.

01:32:18.074 --> 01:32:21.243
We can discuss it inside.
Okay.

01:32:32.004 --> 01:32:33.296
So...

01:32:35.466 --> 01:32:38.093
Good luck with Stanford
and everything.

01:32:38.970 --> 01:32:43.890
Yeah. You know,
you too, with everything.

01:32:46.769 --> 01:32:48.728
We should do this again
sometime.

01:32:50.356 --> 01:32:51.606
Sure.

01:32:53.859 --> 01:32:55.569
Yeah, sure.

01:33:10.751 --> 01:33:12.877
You're getting better
at that.

01:33:13.045 --> 01:33:14.546
I was bad before?

01:33:22.054 --> 01:33:23.388
Thank you...

01:33:26.225 --> 01:33:27.809
...for loving me.

01:33:33.274 --> 01:33:35.150
What's not to love?

01:33:45.661 --> 01:33:47.245
You remember that.

01:33:53.502 --> 01:33:54.753
Hey, Beth.

01:33:56.589 --> 01:33:59.591
See you at the reunion.
Yes.

01:34:00.134 --> 01:34:03.720
If we're both still single,
I'll marry you.

01:34:05.598 --> 01:34:07.182
That's a promise.

01:34:22.114 --> 01:34:23.531
My lady.

01:34:28.954 --> 01:34:30.455
Drive safe.

01:34:37.546 --> 01:34:40.048
So guess what?
Hm?

01:34:40.841 --> 01:34:42.384
I think I'm gay.

01:34:42.885 --> 01:34:44.219
Yeah?

01:34:44.387 --> 01:34:46.846
Oh, that's great,
congratulations!

01:34:47.056 --> 01:34:50.517
Dude.
I'm not gay for you.

01:34:50.810 --> 01:34:52.644
Yeah, no, I know.

01:34:53.479 --> 01:34:56.022
You know, I could be Bi.
Bi?

01:34:56.190 --> 01:34:58.983
I was with two
gorgeous ladies last night.

01:34:59.151 --> 01:35:01.277
That's a lot more
heterosexual than you.

01:35:01.445 --> 01:35:03.279
Well, hey, I
did kiss Beth Cooper.

01:35:03.447 --> 01:35:05.490
Now you gotta
take it to the next level.

01:35:05.658 --> 01:35:08.243
I will. I'm not really
gonna wait for the reunion.

01:35:08.411 --> 01:35:10.954
I'll leave a message on
Facebook, ask her out.

01:35:11.122 --> 01:35:12.914
No, it has to be
a grand gesture.

01:35:13.082 --> 01:35:14.999
Like what?
You know where she lives.

01:35:15.167 --> 01:35:17.836
Go to her house,
bring a boom box, wait for her.

01:35:18.003 --> 01:35:19.421
That's stalking, Rich.

01:35:19.588 --> 01:35:22.298
No, it's not stalking
if you love the person.

01:35:22.466 --> 01:35:26.511
Grab her and take her someplace
where it can be just the two of you.

01:35:26.679 --> 01:35:27.971
Now, that's kidnapping.

01:35:28.139 --> 01:35:29.514
It's romantic.

01:35:31.058 --> 01:35:34.853
Okay, first we're gonna need
some rope and duct tape.
