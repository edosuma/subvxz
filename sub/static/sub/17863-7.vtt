WEBVTT

00:01.272 --> 00:02.272
_

00:02.290 --> 00:03.790
Oh,
I hate reading the newspaper.

00:03.792 --> 00:05.458
They cover all the important
society women.

00:05.460 --> 00:06.876
Why not me? Look at this one.

00:06.878 --> 00:08.928
"Esmerelda Franco, age 52.

00:08.930 --> 00:10.346
Left behind 2 children

00:10.348 --> 00:12.265
- and 77 grandchildren."
- That's an obituary.

00:12.267 --> 00:13.600
Well, I agree with Lillian.

00:13.602 --> 00:19.522
Look! Why is there
this stupid Str-- St--

00:19.524 --> 00:21.441
Ugh, that damn
Stringburger baby!

00:21.443 --> 00:23.142
- Yes!
- She gets all the attention

00:23.144 --> 00:24.227
now-- she got lucky.

00:24.229 --> 00:25.528
She's in the paper every day.

00:25.530 --> 00:27.030
Have a little perspective.

00:27.032 --> 00:28.698
- That girl was abducted.
- She's not a girl.

00:28.700 --> 00:30.984
She's a baby,
and she's not even pretty.

00:30.986 --> 00:33.236
I don't understand why some
stupid kidnapped baby

00:33.238 --> 00:34.954
is getting all this attention.

00:34.956 --> 00:36.656
I have eight babies of my own,
and I can't give them away.

00:36.658 --> 00:38.825
An innocent girl was kidnapped!

00:38.827 --> 00:42.328
I'd say that deserves
a little attention.

00:42.330 --> 00:43.579
Damn it, you're right.

00:43.581 --> 00:46.049
If a stupid baby
who can't read, write,

00:46.051 --> 00:47.834
or make
love is making headlines,

00:47.836 --> 00:51.337
imagine the hubbub if America's
sweetheart went missing.

00:51.339 --> 00:52.672
- Helen Keller?
- Santa Claus?

00:52.674 --> 00:54.223
- Susan B Anthony?
- Frederick?

00:54.225 --> 00:57.977
- Harry Houdini.
- I'm talking about me!

00:58.897 --> 01:00.730
I'm talking about me.

01:17.749 --> 01:22.201
Hey! Psst.

01:22.203 --> 01:24.287
I hear you're the type of guy
who's not afraid to get

01:24.289 --> 01:27.040
- his hands dirty.
- What?

01:27.042 --> 01:28.841
I hear you are
a deranged criminal.

01:28.843 --> 01:30.293
Oh, that.

01:30.295 --> 01:33.796
Well, one man's Jew tracker
is another man's Jew--

01:33.798 --> 01:36.466
I didn't come here
for anecdotes from a dogman.

01:36.468 --> 01:38.184
Well, why did you come here,
princess?

01:38.186 --> 01:39.469
I want you to kidnap me.

01:39.471 --> 01:41.354
I want to ride that wave
of abduction fame

01:41.356 --> 01:42.772
that's all the rage right now.

01:42.774 --> 01:48.478
Well, that depends
what you're offering.

01:48.480 --> 01:50.396
What do I think
kidnapping's going to be like?

01:50.398 --> 01:52.949
Hmm. Maybe a little R&R.

01:52.951 --> 01:55.234
Perhaps a maritime
retreat to Nova Scotia

01:55.236 --> 01:57.987
for a gravlox tasting!

01:57.989 --> 02:01.074
Come later today, after
my hot-air-balloon lesson.

02:01.076 --> 02:02.158
Oh, and do me a favor.

02:02.160 --> 02:03.743
Make sure to bathe.

02:03.745 --> 02:08.047
Can't have my shoulder
smelling like a beef roast.

02:08.049 --> 02:09.749
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:09.751 --> 02:13.970
Like shit.

02:17.258 --> 02:19.092
You rang, Madam?

02:19.094 --> 02:21.260
Yes.
I need something from you.

02:21.262 --> 02:23.012
You've already
had enough morphine

02:23.014 --> 02:24.897
to kill a ragtime singer.

02:24.899 --> 02:27.266
No. I've been invited

02:27.268 --> 02:29.402
to a "Meeting of The Minds"
luncheon

02:29.404 --> 02:31.738
at Mark Twain's home
in Providence.

02:31.740 --> 02:35.608
I simply must go,
but cannot be unattended.

02:35.610 --> 02:38.444
I need you to put
on one of my husband's suits

02:38.446 --> 02:40.496
and accompany me
to the luncheon,

02:40.498 --> 02:44.367
never betraying to anyone
that you are not he.

02:44.369 --> 02:46.452
They'll discover the charade
immediately.

02:46.454 --> 02:49.172
I-- I carry myself
like a servant.

02:49.174 --> 02:51.624
Look. Do you see?

02:51.626 --> 02:54.460
The unsightly gait
of a common flea!

02:54.462 --> 02:56.129
I'm little better than a Gypsy.

02:56.131 --> 02:58.965
Half a step
removed from Mongoloid.

02:58.967 --> 03:00.633
No, Madam, I-- I beg you.

03:00.635 --> 03:04.971
It will never work.
It's simply unthinkable.

03:04.973 --> 03:08.975
It is an order.

03:08.977 --> 03:10.810
As you wish, Madam.

03:19.871 --> 03:22.822
No, Blanche,
I said I wanted this dress.

03:22.824 --> 03:25.992
Oh, but Miss Beatrice,
this is the exact same dress.

03:25.994 --> 03:27.293
Blanche, I'm not an idiot.

03:27.295 --> 03:28.494
This one is small.

03:28.496 --> 03:30.163
That one is big.

03:30.165 --> 03:33.499
Aah!
I hate you!

03:33.501 --> 03:34.834
Where did you get this dress?

03:34.836 --> 03:36.219
In town?

03:36.221 --> 03:37.303
Burn it!

03:37.305 --> 03:39.172
I look ugly all the time!

03:39.174 --> 03:40.673
You hate me, Blanche!

03:40.675 --> 03:44.677
You hate me! That's
why you make me dress like this!

03:44.679 --> 03:46.062
I'm sorry, Miss Beatrice.

03:46.064 --> 03:47.680
I--

03:47.682 --> 03:49.182
Emotions aren't something
I understand,

03:49.184 --> 03:51.350
but I just keep screaming
until I get my way,

03:51.352 --> 03:53.603
vomit, or get my way.

03:53.605 --> 03:56.272
Clean up the mess
you made, Blanche!

04:00.028 --> 04:02.195
"Sincerely,

04:02.197 --> 04:06.165
The Kidnapper."

04:13.341 --> 04:15.424
Oh, farmers.

04:15.426 --> 04:17.877
Oh, farmers.

04:17.879 --> 04:19.212
Farmers.

04:52.797 --> 04:54.714
What is all that howling
and crashing?

04:54.716 --> 04:57.049
It's just
Beatrice's Wednesday tantrum.

04:57.051 --> 04:59.719
She'll vomit,
and then men-stru-ate,

04:59.721 --> 05:01.470
and then all will be well.

05:01.472 --> 05:06.592
One more,
below the 86th parallel.

05:06.594 --> 05:09.478
- Garfield.
- Mm-hmm.

05:09.480 --> 05:10.846
I've never been more afraid.

05:10.848 --> 05:12.815
Don't worry.
You'll do great!

05:12.817 --> 05:16.352
I'm not talking about myself,
you syphilitic chimney sweep!

05:16.354 --> 05:18.938
I'm talking about you
running things in my absence.

05:18.940 --> 05:20.823
If so much
as a single cob of corn

05:20.825 --> 05:23.659
is out of place when I return,
I'll shove it into your rectum

05:23.661 --> 05:27.163
along with your termination
notice. One more.

05:27.165 --> 05:29.165
You must clean this up,
Blanche.

05:29.167 --> 05:31.450
Don't be an idiot.

05:31.452 --> 05:34.453
Don't be--

05:34.455 --> 05:36.372
Don't be an idiot.

05:47.302 --> 05:50.853
I do spend a lot of time
in Paris.

05:57.979 --> 06:01.314
Why, Peepers,
you look almost human.

06:01.316 --> 06:03.282
Madam, I assure you I am not.

06:03.284 --> 06:06.986
Shall I lash myself to the roof,
or stuff myself in the trunk?

06:06.988 --> 06:09.989
Oh, no, no.
You'll ride in back with me.

06:09.991 --> 06:11.157
Oh, no, Madam.

06:11.159 --> 06:13.542
My bottom was not meant
for comfortable things,

06:13.544 --> 06:15.494
and it would not be proper.

06:15.496 --> 06:18.164
It is an order.

06:18.166 --> 06:19.915
As you wish, Madam.

06:24.505 --> 06:27.089
Really?

06:27.925 --> 06:30.559
Oh.

06:30.561 --> 06:32.094
Hello.

06:32.096 --> 06:34.847
Are you lost? Did you wander
into the wrong manor?

06:34.849 --> 06:37.183
Where are your lady's maids?
Do you want to be best friends?

06:37.185 --> 06:38.734
- I don't understand. What--
- Come on.

06:38.736 --> 06:40.152
What--
I don't.

06:40.154 --> 06:42.938
I don't think
Beatrice knows it's me!

06:42.940 --> 06:45.524
Then again, I once saw her get
into an argument with an egg,

06:45.526 --> 06:47.743
and she lost, so.

06:59.874 --> 07:02.208
How dare you treat
me so roughly?

07:02.210 --> 07:04.126
- What the hell was that?
- An abduction.

07:04.128 --> 07:06.212
What do you think
a kidnapping is, huh?

07:06.214 --> 07:09.131
A short sabbatical followed
by international acclaim.

07:09.133 --> 07:11.467
I'm the former Under-Duchess
to former Lower Bavaria!

07:11.469 --> 07:16.555
Well, you're the current
duchess of my dirt floor.

07:16.557 --> 07:20.059
Now, would you care
for some tea, Madam?

07:20.061 --> 07:22.778
Finally, a little service
around here.

07:28.036 --> 07:29.485
Oops.

07:29.487 --> 07:30.736
I spilled.

07:30.738 --> 07:32.405
Clean it up, piggy.

07:32.407 --> 07:35.991
And while you're at it...

07:38.212 --> 07:39.662
clean that up too.

07:39.664 --> 07:41.714
If you think I'm going anywhere

07:41.716 --> 07:43.249
near that festering mass

07:43.251 --> 07:46.252
of boils you call your penis,
you're wrong.

07:46.254 --> 07:47.503
How do you know
that they're festering?

07:47.505 --> 07:49.138
You been thinking about them?

07:49.140 --> 07:51.340
Oh, you just you wait until
my family finds my ransom note!

07:51.342 --> 07:53.059
You'll be sorry!
Ah!

07:53.061 --> 07:55.094
I'll slit your throat, princess.

08:00.735 --> 08:02.985
Maybe I was being
a little rough on her,

08:02.987 --> 08:06.906
but, hey, she said
she wanted it to seem real.

08:06.908 --> 08:08.607
And also, in retrospect,

08:08.609 --> 08:12.695
I probably shouldn't have poured
boiling water on my genitals.

08:17.432 --> 08:19.465
Mr. Mark Twain.

08:19.467 --> 08:23.018
Dodo! What a pleasure
to see you again.

08:23.020 --> 08:25.688
Last I saw you,
I had the sour-mash shits

08:25.690 --> 08:28.224
at your daughter's husband's
fake funeral.

08:28.226 --> 08:30.726
Nasty affair
that turned out to be.

08:30.728 --> 08:34.780
The funeral or the shits?

08:34.782 --> 08:38.900
This is my husband,
The Commodore.

08:38.903 --> 08:41.070
Oh, Blanche,

08:41.072 --> 08:42.905
I think you might be
the best friend I've ever had.

08:42.907 --> 08:44.874
Except for my bed, David,
but he's more like family.

08:44.876 --> 08:48.711
Well, the last 30 minutes have
been really amazing for me too.

08:48.713 --> 08:50.329
- Can I tell you a secret?
- Yes.

08:50.331 --> 08:52.214
We had this servant.
Her name was Anna.

08:52.216 --> 08:55.134
That's my sister--'s name.

08:55.136 --> 08:56.252
Oh! Funny.

08:56.254 --> 08:57.753
Well, Anna ran away.

08:57.755 --> 08:58.921
Only she didn't run away.

08:58.923 --> 09:00.756
She's in a box, under my bed.

09:00.758 --> 09:01.891
At least, I think she is.

09:01.893 --> 09:03.309
I haven't checked in a while.

09:03.311 --> 09:04.760
Oh! Uh--

09:04.762 --> 09:06.262
everyone needs hobbies.

09:06.264 --> 09:09.899
Garfield, have Blanche
fetch my friend a sandwich.

09:09.901 --> 09:13.402
Oh, but Lady Beatrice,
this is Blanche.

09:13.404 --> 09:14.687
I just said Blanche.

09:14.689 --> 09:16.605
You're so stupid!

09:16.607 --> 09:17.990
See, sometimes you
have to be mean to them.

09:17.992 --> 09:20.192
They respond better that way.
Ooh, try it!

09:20.194 --> 09:21.877
Well, I'm not sure
that I can do that.

09:21.879 --> 09:24.280
You can do it.

09:24.282 --> 09:25.448
Garfield.

09:25.450 --> 09:26.832
Mm-hmm?

09:26.834 --> 09:29.452
You look like you have rickets.

09:29.454 --> 09:30.786
Oh. How did you know?

09:30.788 --> 09:32.788
Not like that! Garfield.

09:32.790 --> 09:33.789
Yes, ma'am?

09:33.791 --> 09:36.208
You're fired.

09:36.210 --> 09:37.259
I'm a what?

09:37.261 --> 09:39.762
- You're fired.
- I'm fired?

09:39.764 --> 09:42.631
I-- This is the worst day
of my life!

09:42.633 --> 09:44.800
Oh, God!

09:44.802 --> 09:46.969
I can't be fired!

09:46.971 --> 09:48.804
I'm just kidding.
You're not fired.

09:48.806 --> 09:50.306
Oh, very good.

09:50.308 --> 09:51.974
I love to watch the light
go out in their eyes.

09:51.976 --> 09:53.859
Oh, you got me good--

09:53.861 --> 09:54.860
But get her that sandwich.

09:54.862 --> 09:57.813
Yes, right away.

09:57.815 --> 10:00.449
I'll have to show you Anna
later.

10:00.451 --> 10:02.651
Yes, please.

10:04.822 --> 10:06.622
Yes.

10:06.624 --> 10:08.491
That's a good little piggy.

10:08.493 --> 10:09.708
Clean it up.

10:09.710 --> 10:12.828
You know what?

10:12.830 --> 10:13.829
Cook me dinner.

10:13.831 --> 10:14.830
What's that?

10:14.832 --> 10:16.048
It's a potato.

10:16.050 --> 10:17.166
Where's the silver tray?

10:17.168 --> 10:18.551
Where's the beurre blanc?

10:18.553 --> 10:20.970
Just cook it.

10:20.972 --> 10:23.506
Not with your hands.

10:23.508 --> 10:25.841
Teeth.

10:35.403 --> 10:38.153
Now, let us begin
with an absinthe toast!

10:38.155 --> 10:40.239
Raise your glasses.

10:40.241 --> 10:41.774
Mmm.

10:41.776 --> 10:43.953
Drink up, Commodore!

10:47.248 --> 10:50.416
Allow me to introduce
today's guests.

10:50.418 --> 10:56.088
The wild-haired superstar of
Russian Marxism, Leon Trotsky!

10:56.090 --> 10:59.842
I am just here to further
the cause of the working class.

10:59.844 --> 11:01.377
Our next guest is a lawyer

11:01.379 --> 11:04.680
who's gotten me
out of many a fraud charge.

11:04.682 --> 11:07.550
Mohandas Gandhi, everyone!

11:07.552 --> 11:10.219
I'm just here
for the white women.

11:10.221 --> 11:13.556
You wicked Oriental elf.

11:13.558 --> 11:14.940
What are you doing, man?

11:14.942 --> 11:16.525
Are you attempting
to serve a warm bisque

11:16.527 --> 11:18.227
with a gazpacho spoon?

11:18.229 --> 11:20.446
What is this, the beer hall?

11:20.448 --> 11:25.067
The Commodore is a--
a stickler for silverware.

11:25.069 --> 11:26.735
I am a stickler
for the barest standards

11:26.737 --> 11:29.204
of propriety from a butler!

11:29.206 --> 11:32.241
Why is Blanche acting
like she isn't one of us?

11:32.243 --> 11:34.043
I mean,
it must be switcheroo day.

11:34.045 --> 11:35.911
There is no switcheroo day.

11:35.913 --> 11:39.298
Beatrice is such an idiot, she
can't tell Blanche is a servant,

11:39.300 --> 11:41.000
because she's
wearing her dress.

11:41.002 --> 11:43.085
But Beatrice can't be an idiot.

11:43.087 --> 11:44.553
She lives upstairs!

11:44.555 --> 11:48.591
Sounds like you need
to switcheroo your attitude,

11:48.593 --> 11:50.059
Chair.

11:50.061 --> 11:51.927
Ready to clean, Eileen?

11:51.929 --> 11:54.263
"Yes, Garfield!"

11:54.265 --> 11:56.932
Don't get jealous, Towel.

11:56.934 --> 11:58.567
I always say,

11:58.569 --> 12:01.937
"Have enough servants
to satisfy your every whim,

12:01.939 --> 12:04.239
but not enough
to murder your family."

12:04.241 --> 12:05.491
Excellent point, Madam--

12:05.493 --> 12:07.026
wife-- madam wife.

12:07.028 --> 12:09.361
Families should only be
murdered during revolution.

12:09.363 --> 12:11.780
- Gandhi, boy? A rebuttal?
- Well, no offense,

12:11.782 --> 12:13.949
but you sound like you
belong to the bitch caste.

12:13.951 --> 12:17.286
I was raped in a gulag
by Cossacks.

12:17.288 --> 12:19.872
Do you think your insults
mean anything to me?

12:19.874 --> 12:21.206
I don't know what a gulag is,

12:21.208 --> 12:23.459
but I will send
you right back there!

12:23.461 --> 12:24.927
- Come here!
- Mr. Ghandi!

12:24.929 --> 12:26.962
Mr. Ghandi, Mr. Trotsky, please!

12:26.964 --> 12:28.764
Spirited debate is one thing.

12:28.766 --> 12:31.050
Violence is quite another.

12:31.052 --> 12:32.801
Non-violence.

12:32.803 --> 12:35.220
I had never thought of that.

12:35.222 --> 12:37.690
Because I'm not a little bitch!

12:37.692 --> 12:39.141
Ah!

12:40.027 --> 12:41.977
Dear God, please free me.

12:41.979 --> 12:44.146
And if you have time,
make me really famous.

12:44.148 --> 12:45.814
And while you're at it,
God, would you mind

12:45.816 --> 12:47.616
killing all my enemies
in a fire?

12:47.618 --> 12:49.985
Ooh, but hopefully after they
bathe, so their hair's still wet

12:49.987 --> 12:51.904
and the fire
takes longer to cook them.

12:51.906 --> 12:53.572
Ah!

12:53.574 --> 12:55.824
Praying to God, huh?

12:55.826 --> 12:57.493
You silly little piggy.

12:57.495 --> 12:59.628
What's the latest gossip
in town about my kidnapping?

12:59.630 --> 13:01.497
Has a search party
been sent out?

13:01.499 --> 13:03.165
Are the banks closed?

13:03.167 --> 13:04.667
Well, actually, there's
a real pleasantness in the air.

13:04.669 --> 13:08.554
Like some horrible lingering
fart just left the room.

13:08.556 --> 13:10.756
You know, at first
I was able to accept your abuse

13:10.758 --> 13:13.926
as a realistic detail in
a curated kidnapping experience,

13:13.928 --> 13:15.594
but-- you're just rude,

13:15.596 --> 13:17.896
and I've taken enough abuse
from you, and I want to go home!

13:17.898 --> 13:20.015
Fine! You can go.

13:20.017 --> 13:21.850
I won't stop you.

13:21.852 --> 13:25.070
But I imagine the newspapers
will be very interested to know

13:25.072 --> 13:27.690
that you hired me to kidnap you.

13:27.692 --> 13:29.441
Ugh, you're a monster!

13:33.280 --> 13:36.498
Penis-size-wise,
you're correct.

13:37.835 --> 13:40.786
Your breath smells like broth.

13:40.788 --> 13:42.337
So you'll stay?

13:42.339 --> 13:45.708
I don't suppose I have
any other choice, do I?

13:45.710 --> 13:49.094
No. No choice.

13:49.096 --> 13:50.679
No choice at all.

13:56.520 --> 13:58.937
Life is not possible
without the working man.

13:58.939 --> 14:00.222
Point for the Jew!

14:00.224 --> 14:01.774
Without the rich,

14:01.776 --> 14:04.143
the serving class would have
nothing to do but gamble,

14:04.145 --> 14:06.061
eat taffy, and drink gasoline!

14:06.063 --> 14:07.646
But the serving class suffers!

14:07.648 --> 14:09.865
As we should!

14:09.867 --> 14:10.899
Uhh-- they should!

14:10.901 --> 14:12.367
As they should!

14:12.369 --> 14:14.486
Just imag-- a thought.
A thought, everybody.

14:14.488 --> 14:19.324
What would happen
if everybody had enough food?

14:19.326 --> 14:21.577
Uh, we would all have
something to eat.

14:21.579 --> 14:23.996
No! Well, yes, probably.

14:23.998 --> 14:25.080
But then what?

14:25.082 --> 14:26.548
Laziness.

14:26.550 --> 14:27.382
Sloth.

14:27.384 --> 14:29.384
Soon, nobody would do anything.

14:29.386 --> 14:31.920
There are always people
who have to do the jobs

14:31.922 --> 14:33.088
that nobody else wants to do.

14:33.090 --> 14:34.757
If the Chinamen
had enough to eat,

14:34.759 --> 14:36.759
he wouldn't want to string
the telegraph wires, would he?

14:36.761 --> 14:39.728
Look, I don't like Chinamen
either, but it's still not fair.

14:39.730 --> 14:42.314
We have such a thing
in this world as order.

14:42.316 --> 14:44.399
The strong rule the weak.

14:44.401 --> 14:47.436
If there were only strong,
overpopulation ensues!

14:47.438 --> 14:49.571
Soon there will be one billion
people on this planet.

14:49.573 --> 14:52.241
Do you think our planet
can afford one billion people?

14:52.243 --> 14:53.692
Of course not! The planet

14:53.694 --> 14:56.328
itself will sink down into space
and explode.

14:56.330 --> 14:57.746
I'm having a great time.

14:57.748 --> 14:59.031
I am The Commodore.

14:59.033 --> 15:00.282
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.

15:00.284 --> 15:01.617
Well played.

15:03.437 --> 15:04.603
- Ah!
- Ah! Take me!

15:04.605 --> 15:07.556
All right.

15:07.558 --> 15:09.141
I'll take you, I guess--

15:09.143 --> 15:11.010
Ah, yeah. Ah! Yeah--

15:11.012 --> 15:12.811
Oh, sorry.

15:12.813 --> 15:13.979
Sorry. Is your hair okay?

15:13.981 --> 15:15.514
- Take me!
- Okay, yeah, sure.

15:15.516 --> 15:17.316
- I'll-- I'll-- I'll take you--
- Give it to me!

15:17.318 --> 15:20.602
I'll take you.
Yeah, no, just one second here,

15:20.604 --> 15:22.821
and we are off to the races--

15:22.823 --> 15:25.190
- Give me it!
- One second, and-- one second.

15:25.192 --> 15:27.743
- Uh-huh. Yes.
- Just one sec-- okay.

15:27.745 --> 15:30.029
Oh, no-- oh, oh, oh, oh!
Here we go.

15:30.031 --> 15:32.865
- Yeah-- No. There. One second.
- Ow.

15:38.456 --> 15:39.538
Oops!

15:39.540 --> 15:40.923
I dropped my fork.

15:40.925 --> 15:42.758
Oh, no, that's okay, Garfield.

15:42.760 --> 15:44.293
I'd like Chair to do it.

15:51.686 --> 15:54.636
You're going to regret this.

15:54.638 --> 15:57.056
Oops! I dropped my fork, too.

15:57.058 --> 15:59.558
Chair, stop making
me drop things!

15:59.560 --> 16:01.226
Oh, I would like
an oyster, please.

16:01.228 --> 16:02.227
Hmm.

16:07.952 --> 16:09.401
Actually, I changed my mind.

16:09.403 --> 16:10.652
I don't want an oyster.

16:10.654 --> 16:12.037
Oh, I do.

16:12.039 --> 16:13.405
Of course,
now that I'm thinking about it,

16:13.407 --> 16:15.824
I would like an oyster.

16:15.826 --> 16:20.329
I feel like I
should have one first.

16:20.331 --> 16:21.830
Thank you.

16:21.832 --> 16:23.605
Will you feed it to me?

16:26.670 --> 16:30.055
Thank you, Chair.

16:30.057 --> 16:31.173
Oops!

16:31.175 --> 16:33.092
I dropped my fork again.

16:35.563 --> 16:40.099
Oh. Oh, whoops.

16:40.101 --> 16:43.936
I know I'm not supposed
to feed the animals.

16:43.938 --> 16:48.323
Oops!

16:48.325 --> 16:51.744
Meat Face! Meat Face!
Meat Face!

16:51.746 --> 16:55.197
They chose the wrong
bitch to throw meat at.

16:55.199 --> 16:56.665
This doesn't usually
happen to me--

16:56.667 --> 16:58.917
No, no, I know.

16:58.919 --> 17:02.171
- Was it because of me?
- It wasn't because of you.

17:02.173 --> 17:07.376
I guess it kind of ruined things
when you said you were into it.

17:07.377 --> 17:09.428
Not that I didn't want
you to be into it, but--

17:09.430 --> 17:11.964
I just didn't want you to tell
me that you were into it.

17:11.965 --> 17:14.967
It ruins it for me.

17:14.969 --> 17:17.136
Next time I'll be sure
to cry and vomit.

17:20.107 --> 17:23.142
- I'm gonna go--
- I-- I think you should go.

17:27.314 --> 17:30.199
You were marvelous
this evening.

17:30.201 --> 17:32.284
That's why they
call you the Commodore.

17:32.286 --> 17:34.953
- I'm your butler--
- I must repay you

17:34.955 --> 17:37.790
for your brilliant
performance this evening.

17:37.792 --> 17:39.825
I'm going to blow your bellows.

17:39.827 --> 17:42.744
Oh, no, no, no. No, no,
I cannot allow such a thing.

17:42.746 --> 17:44.129
No, no. No.

17:44.131 --> 17:47.082
Madam, I cannot allow
such a proposition.

17:47.084 --> 17:48.133
Unbutton!

17:48.135 --> 17:52.254
That is an order!

17:52.256 --> 17:54.256
As you wish, Madam.

17:58.345 --> 18:00.846
Ohh!

18:02.349 --> 18:03.649
Blanche.

18:03.651 --> 18:05.350
Almost happy to see you.

18:05.352 --> 18:06.735
Now, I had the worst day.

18:06.737 --> 18:08.103
Get me a poultice, a dildo,

18:08.105 --> 18:09.855
and a soft French cheese.

18:09.857 --> 18:11.523
- Yes, my lady.
- Where's Beatrice?

18:11.525 --> 18:13.775
She has oyster diarrhea,
my lady.

18:13.777 --> 18:15.110
What are you doing

18:15.112 --> 18:17.529
in that dress?
Take that off immediately!

18:17.531 --> 18:20.032
Yes, my lady.

18:24.288 --> 18:26.922
Now, I'll be in my room,
waiting on that dildo.

18:26.924 --> 18:29.208
- Yes, my lady.
- Heat it up in the bath first.

18:29.210 --> 18:31.260
Yes, my lady.

18:34.048 --> 18:38.383
Hello, Blanche, have you seen
my new friend Bla--

18:38.385 --> 18:40.052
Wait a minute.

18:40.054 --> 18:41.186
You're not Blanche the person.

18:41.188 --> 18:42.688
You're Blanche the servant!

18:42.690 --> 18:44.556
Get out of my room!
I never want to see you again,

18:44.558 --> 18:45.941
unless you're bringing
me breakfast,

18:45.943 --> 18:47.359
so I'll see you in the morning!

18:47.361 --> 18:50.062
Yes. What would you like
for breakfast?

18:50.064 --> 18:52.064
- Eggs Beatrice!
- Yes, my lady.

18:52.066 --> 18:54.449
I'm sorry, my lady.

18:57.071 --> 19:00.289
Oh! I like this dress!
Mmm.

19:00.291 --> 19:02.824
Oh, I knew the whole time.
I was just having fun.

19:08.463 --> 19:10.547
Peepers, I don't mean
to be a Nosy Parker,

19:10.549 --> 19:13.550
but I must tell you
something quite shocking.

19:13.552 --> 19:15.101
What is it, Chair?

19:15.103 --> 19:17.887
Blanche spent all of yesterday
in one of Beatrice's dresses,

19:17.889 --> 19:21.307
impersonating
an upper-class woman.

19:21.309 --> 19:23.143
Hmm.

19:23.145 --> 19:27.647
Well, I think we can let
this little impropriety slide.

19:27.649 --> 19:32.485
We all deserve a switcheroo
every now and again, eh, Chair?

19:32.487 --> 19:34.654
- But, sir--
- Ooh, speaking of butts, Chair,

19:34.656 --> 19:37.323
there is an oyster situation
in Beatrice's water closet

19:37.325 --> 19:40.043
that I need you
to attend to post haste. Go.

19:40.045 --> 19:42.996
Muddy, muddy, scrubby, scrubby.

19:50.138 --> 19:52.222
I'll need you to skin
those potatoes.

19:52.224 --> 19:54.674
Ask the cook. Not my job!

19:54.676 --> 19:56.976
Turns out I'm your boss.

19:56.978 --> 20:01.431
So it's your job now, piggy.

20:11.026 --> 20:13.743
Great.
Now you get hard!

20:22.003 --> 20:26.873
Oh! Oh, ho, Peepers!

20:26.875 --> 20:30.293
Oh, what happened last night?

20:30.295 --> 20:33.930
I don't remember anything
after the toast.

20:33.932 --> 20:38.551
Oh-- no, nothing.

20:38.553 --> 20:41.938
I'm never drinking
absinthe again.

20:41.940 --> 20:43.273
That reminds me,

20:43.275 --> 20:46.860
I have a pair of soiled
bloomers from last night

20:46.862 --> 20:48.194
that need laundering.

20:48.196 --> 20:50.864
So you-- take care of that,
will you?

20:50.866 --> 20:54.234
Muddy, muddy, scrubby, scrubby.

20:54.236 --> 20:55.735
As you wish, Madam.
