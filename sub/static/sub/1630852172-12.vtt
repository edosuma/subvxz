19:00.556 --> 19:01.473
No, she's being humble.

19:01.557 --> 19:03.183

she cooks is unreal.

19:10.065 --> 19:13.402

to make the sangria.
-(CLEARS THROAT)

19:13.485 --> 19:16.238
-What the hell. I'll do it.
-That's an emphatic yes from me.

19:16.321 --> 19:18.365
I'll just text Kenneth
to bring the wine up.

19:18.448 --> 19:19.032
No, Grace and I
can go grab the wine.

19:19.116 --> 19:20.826
I wanted to show her the cellar.

19:20.909 --> 19:22.411
No!

19:22.494 --> 19:26.290
I... Grace needs to show us
how to eat her pasta.

19:26.373 --> 19:26.915
Right.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.585
Z, can you grab the wine?

19:29.668 --> 19:32.421
-Sure. It's, uh, where?
-The cellar.

19:32.504 --> 19:33.964
So, go past the kitchen

19:34.047 --> 19:35.716
to the door
at the base of the stairs,

19:35.799 --> 19:37.134
make a right, and then
continue down that hallway

19:37.217 --> 19:40.971
until you see another stairway.
And that's where it is.

19:41.054 --> 19:42.139
Okay. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

19:43.807 --> 19:45.309
-As fast as possible.
-(CLEARS THROAT)

19:46.268 --> 19:48.186
So, how'd you guys meet?

19:48.270 --> 19:49.605
At Teterboro.

19:49.688 --> 19:50.731
Were you going to Germany?

19:51.273 --> 19:52.941
No, I, uh, I was--

19:53.025 --> 19:54.860
He had no idea
where he was going.

19:54.943 --> 19:55.777
He was a mess.

19:55.861 --> 19:57.905
He walked into our plane
thinking it was his.

19:57.988 --> 20:00.115
Once I sat down,
I couldn't get up.

20:00.198 --> 20:00.991
He admitted he had
nowhere to go.

20:01.074 --> 20:04.786
So I asked him
if he could go anywhere,

20:04.870 --> 20:06.371
anywhere in the world,
where would it be?

20:06.455 --> 20:07.664
-And I said...
-Two years ago.

20:07.748 --> 20:09.958
It just broke my heart.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.168
Cause that's what
we all want, right?

20:11.251 --> 20:13.712
To go back before COVID,
before everything changed.

20:13.795 --> 20:15.923
So I took him to Paris.

20:16.882 --> 20:19.134
And then to Split.
And then to Fez.

20:19.217 --> 20:21.595
And then to Virginia
for Christmas.

20:21.678 --> 20:24.306
Taught him how to make biscuits

20:25.682 --> 20:27.142

a few times, but...

with dignity,

20:29.561 --> 20:30.854

37:07.099 --> 37:10.102
-No, I-- Jesus.
-Julien's going to sing!

37:10.186 --> 37:11.812
JULIEN: No, I'm not gonna sing.

37:11.896 --> 37:13.981
She's beautiful, I love her.

37:14.065 --> 37:17.151
She's the Bradley to my Cooper.

37:17.234 --> 37:18.319
My parents,
they're about to pass me

37:18.402 --> 37:21.781
back and forth like a dessert
that they're sharing.

37:21.864 --> 37:23.324
And you guys,
you wanna do the same thing?

37:24.659 --> 37:27.161
Do you even-- Do you even care
what's on the line for me?

37:27.244 --> 37:29.372
If it doesn't work out,
if someone gets jealous?

37:29.455 --> 37:33.501
Or you two, you just get tired
of the extra-- extra effort.

37:33.584 --> 37:34.335
Then I'm the expendable one.

37:36.754 --> 37:38.214
No. I'm done
having this conversation.

37:40.424 --> 37:42.176
Just leave me alone
and let me go.

37:49.266 --> 37:51.519
JULIEN: Maybe we can go get
some fresh air?

37:51.602 --> 37:53.229
Do you think that
I should intervene?

37:53.312 --> 37:55.231
I don't need air,
I need tequila.

37:55.314 --> 37:56.273
No, you definitely don't.

37:56.357 --> 37:58.025
-GRACE: ♪ In the sha-ha... ♪
-Thank you.

37:58.109 --> 37:59.360
Don't you think
she's had enough?

38:01.445 --> 38:02.655
You're probably right.

38:02.738 --> 38:05.408
She's already far
exceeded expectation.

38:05.491 --> 38:07.576
Oh, why do you think
she's here, Zoya?

38:07.660 --> 38:09.161
So that Obie can see her mess
and get back with Julien.

38:09.245 --> 38:11.956
And then JC can go back to
the way things were

38:12.039 --> 38:12.415
before Gossip Girl.

38:13.624 --> 38:14.583
Hmm?

38:28.848 --> 38:30.683
Okay. Okay.

38:30.766 --> 38:32.226
I thought I had to compete
with you, but I didn't.

38:32.977 --> 38:34.270
You're losing to yourself.

38:36.480 --> 38:37.481
Give me the mic!

38:37.565 --> 38:40.192
Hey! Why are you
being like this? Be fun.

38:40.276 --> 38:42.194
-Grace!
-Be fun, bitch.

38:42.278 --> 38:43.863
Grace, I think it's time
that we go, okay?

38:43.946 --> 38:44.947
-GRACE: Really?
-Yes.

38:45.031 --> 38:47.408
Now you're on her side?

38:47.491 --> 38:50.578
Fucking Yankees. All the same.

38:50.661 --> 38:52.121
And you know what, Julien?

38:52.204 --> 38:54.373
You suck at games!

38:54.457 --> 38:56.083
-We gotta get her out of here.
-OBIE: I'm trying.

38:56.167 --> 38:57.126
Oh, my God, you guys. It's the--

38:57.209 --> 39:00.004
It's the door guy
who sold me drugs.

39:00.087 --> 39:02.715
-It's time to go.
-Do you know that's
a federal crime?

39:02.798 --> 39:03.549
-Grace, stop!
-BOUNCER: Give me the mic.

39:03.632 --> 39:06.260
-You-- you want the mic?
-JULIEN: Grace.

39:06.344 --> 39:07.678
-OBIE: Grace.
-GRACE: You want the mic?

39:07.762 --> 39:09.096
Mic drop!

-(GASPS) Oh, my God!
-(MICROPHONE SQUEALS)

39:10.598 --> 39:12.475
OBIE: Grace. Okay, that's it.
Come down.

39:12.558 --> 39:14.268
-Oh, my God.
-GRACE: No.

39:14.351 --> 39:17.021
-Oh, my God.
-GRACE: No. Help me.

39:17.104 --> 39:21.859
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

39:40.669 --> 39:42.630
Hmm, I wonder where Grace is?

39:42.713 --> 39:47.134
Blanche DuBlah's probably
sleeping off her shame spiral,

39:47.218 --> 39:49.762
which is what I'm trying to do,
but you keep on talking.

40:02.149 --> 40:03.317
Oh, for fuck's sake.

40:08.405 --> 40:10.533
Okay. So listen.

40:11.700 --> 40:13.035
First off, we wanna say
we're really sorry.

40:13.119 --> 40:15.329
We... We feel terrible.

40:15.413 --> 40:16.872
We should've never spoken
to you that way,

40:16.956 --> 40:19.083
and you're not expendable
to us, Max.

40:19.166 --> 40:20.167
But you're right.

40:20.251 --> 40:20.918
We've been together
for a long time,

40:21.001 --> 40:23.170
and we understand that

40:23.254 --> 40:25.131
you may feel that
you have more to lose.

40:25.923 --> 40:27.299
So here's our proposal.

40:27.383 --> 40:27.424
We wanna date you.

40:28.926 --> 40:30.177
Together.

40:30.261 --> 40:30.511
Equals, the three of us.

40:32.054 --> 40:33.347
A triad.

40:33.431 --> 40:35.724
Which is not...
It's not a throuple, okay?

40:35.808 --> 40:36.851
It's a real relationship.

40:36.934 --> 40:37.768
It's based on the fact that

40:37.852 --> 40:40.604
all three sides of
a triangle are equal.

40:41.564 --> 40:42.565
What that means is that...

40:43.691 --> 40:47.069
well, if being together
like that doesn't work

40:47.153 --> 40:49.572
for all three of us, then it
doesn't work for any of us.

40:50.823 --> 40:52.575
We break up.

40:53.951 --> 40:54.952
Her and me.

40:55.661 --> 40:57.204
You and us and...

40:58.289 --> 41:00.666
Honestly, all or nothing.

41:01.292 --> 41:03.794
If you're in, we're in.

41:03.878 --> 41:05.713
But if not, no worries.

41:05.796 --> 41:06.922
It's not an ultimatum.

41:07.006 --> 41:09.383
But we just don't
work without you.

41:09.466 --> 41:12.219
And we don't want to.
That's what's fun.

41:16.515 --> 41:17.892
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

41:22.897 --> 41:24.356
ZOYA: Hey!

41:24.440 --> 41:26.483
I thought you might need these.

41:26.567 --> 41:28.485
But you seem way ahead of me.

41:29.445 --> 41:31.280
I don't remember much
of last night,

41:31.363 --> 41:32.823
but it must be bad.

41:33.657 --> 41:35.367
I woke up on the bathroom floor,

41:35.451 --> 41:38.078
and I haven't seen Obie
once this morning.

41:38.162 --> 41:39.705
I'm afraid to even
open my phone.

41:39.788 --> 41:41.540
No, it-- it wasn't that bad.

41:41.624 --> 41:44.460
You're sweet.
But I'm a politician's kid.

41:44.543 --> 41:45.544
I can smell spin.

41:45.628 --> 41:48.756
Well, listen,
this is just a hazing.

41:48.839 --> 41:50.049
They do it to everybody new.

41:50.132 --> 41:51.884
I mean, take it from me.
Julien's my sister,

41:51.967 --> 41:53.844
and you wouldn't believe
what they've tried.

41:53.928 --> 41:55.262
(CHUCKLES) But I'm still here.

41:55.346 --> 41:58.766
I'd rather leave with the last
shred of dignity I have.

41:58.849 --> 42:01.435
If you leave right now,
you're just letting them win.

42:01.518 --> 42:02.561
And I can tell
Obie is really into you.

42:04.855 --> 42:05.481
You think staying is winning?

42:07.483 --> 42:08.609
Just makes them think
it was all okay.

42:10.277 --> 42:11.320
I gotta go.

42:24.541 --> 42:26.877
You, Aud, and Ak looked great
on the dance floor last night.

42:26.961 --> 42:29.255
Hmm. So did you
and Pabst Blue Robert.

42:29.338 --> 42:30.381
Hmm.

42:31.257 --> 42:32.424
BOTH: Three, two, one.

42:32.508 --> 42:34.134
Will I be leaving with a gift
or just extra baggage?

42:34.218 --> 42:35.636
Can I stay whole
if I agree to become a third?

42:42.059 --> 42:44.186
Hey, are you okay?

42:44.270 --> 42:45.521
Grace left.

42:45.604 --> 42:46.563
Oh.

42:58.075 --> 42:59.868
Hey. Come here.

43:02.746 --> 43:04.790
I know that I've been
distracted this weekend

43:04.873 --> 43:06.667
and it hasn't been
exactly what I promised,

43:06.750 --> 43:10.671
but I wanted to thank you
for being here in support.

43:10.754 --> 43:15.259
It has been so hard to be here
with Grace and Obie.

43:16.135 --> 43:18.012
But now that she's gone,

43:18.095 --> 43:19.680
we can just have
a peaceful New Year's,

43:19.763 --> 43:21.015
no outsiders or--

43:21.098 --> 43:22.766
I don't support what you did.

43:22.850 --> 43:24.310
And I'm also an outsider here,

43:24.393 --> 43:25.519
no matter how much you wanna
pretend that that isn't true.

43:27.730 --> 43:28.814
Why did you lie to me about

43:28.897 --> 43:30.357
what this weekend
was really about?

43:32.109 --> 43:33.902
-(STUTTERS)
-The getting rid of Grace stuff?

43:33.986 --> 43:35.154
Really?

43:35.237 --> 43:37.614
It wasn't about that.
Not originally.

43:38.449 --> 43:40.367
Things got out of hand, but...

43:40.451 --> 43:42.202
This-- this weekend is
about friends.

43:42.286 --> 43:44.705
You keep saying that,
but is this how friends act?

43:44.788 --> 43:45.789
Look...

43:45.873 --> 43:48.083
I know you want things
to go back to the way they were,

43:48.167 --> 43:49.168
but I really wish you didn't,

43:49.251 --> 43:52.171
because they were awful
for anyone that wasn't you.

43:52.254 --> 43:53.756
And I'm not your friend,
I'm your sister.

43:53.839 --> 43:55.257
And as your sister,
I'm telling you,

43:55.341 --> 43:56.383
now is your only chance

43:56.467 --> 43:58.218
to do something
you've never done before.

43:58.302 --> 44:00.262
Be a gracious loser, okay?

44:00.346 --> 44:02.306
Stop fighting for everything,

44:02.389 --> 44:04.099
and just be the bigger person
and let it go!

44:06.018 --> 44:07.186
Holding yourself accountable

44:07.269 --> 44:09.396
instead of letting Gossip Girl
and the rest of the world do it

44:09.480 --> 44:11.398
could be the best thing
to ever happen to you.

44:15.569 --> 44:16.528
(SIGHS)

44:26.497 --> 44:30.793
Oh. And, um, here is my invoice.

44:30.876 --> 44:35.130
I also take, uh, Cash App
or Venmo, if that's easier.

44:35.214 --> 44:37.674
Why is there a cab receipt here?

44:37.758 --> 44:39.802
You specifically told me not to
take the subway or a rideshare.

44:39.885 --> 44:43.389
Are you seriously trying to
nickel and dime me right now?

44:43.472 --> 44:46.517
The cost of the cab
is like an hour of my time.

44:46.600 --> 44:50.604
I don't see how it's my problem
you don't listen.

44:50.687 --> 44:52.815
Implicit to running errands
for someone

44:52.898 --> 44:54.692
is doing what they
ask you to do.

44:54.775 --> 44:58.112
And part of running errands
for people is that

44:58.195 --> 45:00.197
I was denied
my end-of-year bonus

45:00.280 --> 45:02.282
because the board,
made up entirely of parents,

45:02.366 --> 45:04.410
including you,
decided that that money

45:04.493 --> 45:05.911
would be better served
going to a new gym.

45:05.994 --> 45:09.832
So here I am returning
30,000-dollar earrings for you,

45:09.915 --> 45:13.085
and you seriously want to argue
about a 15-dollar cab?

45:13.168 --> 45:14.628
You think you deserved
a bonus this year?

45:14.711 --> 45:18.173
You all complained about
teaching during COVID,

45:18.257 --> 45:19.258
so the school didn't reopen.

45:19.341 --> 45:21.885
Do you know how hard it was
on us working parents?

45:21.969 --> 45:23.470
We didn't wanna risk our lives--

45:23.554 --> 45:26.014
Then, you all
allowed Gossip Girl

45:26.098 --> 45:29.309
to taunt and torment them
upon their return.

45:29.393 --> 45:31.061
Not only did you do
nothing about it,

45:31.145 --> 45:33.188
but some of you even sent in
tips yourselves.

45:33.272 --> 45:36.775
Tips on kids you were
in charge of.

45:36.859 --> 45:39.361
If I could fire each and
every one of you, I would.

45:39.445 --> 45:41.947
So you being cheap was punitive?

45:42.030 --> 45:43.115
That's the thing
with you people,

45:43.198 --> 45:45.951
you think you're entitled
to something you didn't earn.

45:46.034 --> 45:49.329
-Who people?
-Middle-class white girls

45:49.413 --> 45:53.292
who don't stand out, so they
claim some kind of victimhood.

45:53.375 --> 45:56.670
Push others to spread the wealth
they themselves can't earn.

45:56.753 --> 45:58.922
I pay 40% in taxes
so you don't have to.

45:59.006 --> 46:04.261
I trickle down so that you can
teach in a safe environment,

46:04.344 --> 46:07.473
eating cafeteria food
cooked by Michelin chefs,

46:07.556 --> 46:09.516
all while teaching
the future lawmakers of America.

46:09.600 --> 46:12.561
You're glorified babysitters

46:12.644 --> 46:14.855
whose names will be hard
to recollect in five years,

46:14.938 --> 46:18.192
whereas the names of the kids
you purport to teach

46:18.275 --> 46:20.360
will never be forgotten.

46:20.444 --> 46:22.529
It is a privilege

46:23.405 --> 46:23.739
to work at Constance.

46:25.532 --> 46:26.575
And the board...

46:28.827 --> 46:31.288
felt you all needed
to be reminded of that.

46:33.081 --> 46:35.709
Thank you, Mrs. de Haan.

46:35.792 --> 46:37.252
