15:32.660 --> 15:34.321
OUR RECENT TRIALS INDICATE THAT

15:34.330 --> 15:35.991
IT SLOWS THE PROGRESSION. IT CAN

15:36.000 --> 15:37.661
ALSO REDUCE THE BONE MINERAL

CHARITY. TEDDY, YOU'RE GOING

33:12.750 --> 33:15.184
TOO FAR.

33:15.190 --> 33:17.283
>> YOU ARE SUCH A BUZZ KILL.

33:17.290 --> 33:21.522
>> NO. I'M A SURGEON. IT'S IN MY

33:21.530 --> 33:23.418
D.N.A. TO BE CAREFUL AND

33:23.430 --> 33:26.126
METHODICAL AND SAFE. THE VERY

33:26.130 --> 33:28.633
NATURE THAT YOU DETEST IS WHAT

33:28.640 --> 33:30.631
KEEPS PEOPLE ALIVE ON MY TABLE.

33:30.640 --> 33:33.803
I TRIED. BUT I CAN'T CHANGE WHO

33:33.810 --> 33:37.530
I AM. FRANKLY, I DON'T WANT TO

33:37.540 --> 33:38.643
HAVE TO APOLOGIZE FOR IT

33:38.650 --> 33:41.141
ANYMORE.

33:52.830 --> 33:56.197
>> I AM SO SORRY.

33:56.200 --> 33:57.724
>> FOR WHAT?

33:57.730 --> 33:59.197
>> 'CAUSE THIS ISN'T GONNA WORK

33:59.200 --> 34:01.430
OUT.

34:21.360 --> 34:22.384
>> AIN'T GONNA FIND IT OUT

34:22.390 --> 34:24.324
THERE BUDDY BOY.

34:24.330 --> 34:25.479
>> FIND WHAT?

34:25.490 --> 34:27.526
>> SOMETHING TO SAY.

34:27.530 --> 34:29.259
COME ON. SIT DOWN.

34:29.260 --> 34:31.160
>> MY BEST FRIEND JUST TOLD ME

34:31.170 --> 34:31.898
THAT HE'S--

34:31.900 --> 34:33.162
>> DYING.

34:33.170 --> 34:34.330
YOU GOT TO SAY IT. I ACTUALLY

34:34.340 --> 34:35.364
HAVE TO SAY THE WORD. IT'S VERY

34:35.370 --> 34:37.338
IMPORTANT. IT JUST GETS A LOT

34:37.340 --> 34:39.763
WORSE IF YOU DON'T. TRUST ME.

34:39.770 --> 34:41.203
LOOK, I'M THE ONE WHO'S GOT A

34:41.210 --> 34:43.132
$150,000 WEDDING RING. JESUS.

34:43.140 --> 34:44.209
>> YOU'LL GET YOUR MONEY BACK.

34:44.210 --> 34:45.472
>> OH, I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE

34:45.480 --> 34:48.244
MONEY.

34:48.250 --> 34:50.377
IT'S LIZZIE. YOU'RE RIGHT WHAT

34:50.380 --> 34:51.540
YOU SAID. I DRAGGED HER ALL THE

34:51.550 --> 34:52.915
WAY HERE FROM MIAMI AND BROKE

34:52.920 --> 34:56.219
HER HEART AGAIN.

34:56.220 --> 35:00.884
> > SHE'LL UNDERSTAND...GIVEN...

35:00.890 --> 35:02.391
I DIDN'T MEAN ALL THOSE THINGS I

35:02.400 --> 35:04.220
SAID. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT YOU

35:04.230 --> 35:04.924
WERE GOING THROUGH. DO YOU

35:06.770 --> 35:08.169
SMOKING A CIGAR GIVEN WHAT YOUR

35:08.170 --> 35:09.194
BODY IS TRYING TO FIGHT RIGHT

35:09.200 --> 35:11.202
NOW?

35:11.210 --> 35:12.359
>> THIS IS NOT A CIGAR MY

35:12.370 --> 35:13.860
FRIEND. THIS IS PRE-EMBARGO,

35:13.870 --> 35:18.443
HAND ROLLED, CUBAN TOBACCO.

35:18.450 --> 35:23.740
THIS IS AN ARTIFACT.

35:23.750 --> 35:24.739
IT'S BEEN SITTING IN A HUMIDOR

35:24.750 --> 35:26.741
IN MIAMI FOR OVER 40 YEARS. I

35:26.750 --> 35:27.739
BOUGHT 2 OF THEM FOR A SPECIAL

35:27.750 --> 35:30.184
OCCASION, LIKE MY WEDDING. BUT

35:30.190 --> 35:31.487
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, I THINK

35:31.490 --> 35:32.787
NOW'S AS GOOD A TIME AS ANY,

35:32.790 --> 35:33.654
DON'T YOU?

35:33.660 --> 35:36.299
>> LOOK, THERE ARE PLENTY OF

35:36.300 --> 35:38.188
EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENTS AND

35:38.200 --> 35:39.394
CLINICAL TRIALS WE CAN GET YOU

35:39.400 --> 35:40.628
SIGNED UP FOR. THERE'S THE

35:40.630 --> 35:42.291
ANGIOSTATIC APPROACH. THEY USE

35:42.300 --> 35:44.666
ANAEROBIC BACTERIA TO ATTACK THE

35:44.670 --> 35:47.230
TUMOR. CANCER TREATMENT'S NOT

35:47.240 --> 35:48.207
WHAT IT WAS WHEN WE WERE IN

35:48.210 --> 35:49.199
SCHOOL.

35:49.210 --> 35:50.837
>> HAVE A DRINK BUDDY BOY. YOU

35:50.840 --> 35:53.377
NEED ONE.

35:53.380 --> 35:54.347
>> WERE YOU LISTENING TO ME?!

35:54.350 --> 35:55.248
>> MM-HMM.

35:55.250 --> 35:57.275
>> YOU CAN BEAT THIS THING. YOU

35:57.280 --> 35:58.781
CAN GET MARRIED AGAIN SOMEDAY.

35:58.790 --> 35:59.586
YOU DON'T KNOW.

35:59.590 --> 36:00.648
>> YOU DON'T THINK I'VE THOUGHT

36:00.650 --> 36:01.651
ABOUT ALL THAT SHIT, SEAN?!

36:01.660 --> 36:04.754
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY. I DON'T WANT

36:04.760 --> 36:05.852
TO SPEND THE LAST FEW MONTHS OF

36:05.860 --> 36:08.829
MY LIFE IN HOSPITALS. I JUST

36:08.830 --> 36:11.424
WANT--I WANT TO CELEBRATE

36:11.430 --> 36:12.863
EVERY DAY. I WANT TO GET ALL MY

36:12.870 --> 36:15.498
SHIT TOGETHER AND I WANT TO--

36:15.500 --> 36:19.368
I WANT TO ENJOY MYSELF.

36:19.370 --> 36:25.377
AHH.

36:25.380 --> 36:28.474
WILL YOU SIT WITH ME?

36:34.360 --> 36:36.783
>> [SIGH]

36:41.730 --> 36:43.322
YOU GOT TO TRY ONE OF THESE.

36:43.330 --> 36:45.798
THEY'RE INCREDIBLE.

37:11.690 --> 37:12.725
>> YOU DIDN'T NEED TO GET

37:12.730 --> 37:13.685
MARRIED TO MAKE SURE YOU

37:13.690 --> 37:16.295
WOULDN'T BE ALONE.

37:44.590 --> 37:45.852
>> WHY'D YOU WANT TO BRING ME

37:45.860 --> 37:46.884
BACK HERE, SEAN?

37:46.890 --> 37:48.755
>> SO WE CAN FINISH WHAT WE

37:48.760 --> 37:50.796
STARTED. SO EVEN THOUGH IT'S

37:50.800 --> 37:52.620
DARK, YOU CAN SEE I'M WILLING TO

37:52.630 --> 37:54.962
MEET YOU HALF WAY.

37:54.970 --> 37:56.369
>> YOU AREN'T WEARING

37:56.370 --> 37:57.997
UNDERPANTS.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.400
YOU DIRTY BOY.

38:00.410 --> 38:00.865
>> [CHUCKLING]

38:00.870 --> 38:01.939
>> GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS

38:01.940 --> 38:03.100
JACQUELINE. I'LL BE YOUR

38:03.110 --> 38:04.839
WAITRESS. THE AMUSE BOUCHE THIS

38:04.850 --> 38:05.771
EVENING IS--

38:05.780 --> 38:07.042
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, JACQUELINE,

38:07.050 --> 38:08.347
WE'RE GOING TO PASS ON THE AMUSE

38:08.350 --> 38:10.045
BOUCHE. AND ACTUALLY WE WANT TO

38:10.050 --> 38:11.381
BE LEI-T ALONE FOR A WHILE AND

38:11.390 --> 38:12.687
GET USED TO THE DARKNESS.

38:12.690 --> 38:13.987
THERE'S 200 BUCKS IN IT FOR YOU

38:13.990 --> 38:15.116
IF WE DON'T HEAR YOU FOR 30

38:15.120 --> 38:16.610
MINUTES.

38:16.620 --> 38:20.124
>> AS YOU WISH, MR. McNAMARA.

38:20.130 --> 38:22.052
>> GET USED TO THE DARKNESS?

38:22.060 --> 38:24.119
I LIKE THAT.

38:24.130 --> 38:26.394
>> AND YOU'LL LIKE THIS, TOO.

38:26.400 --> 38:28.698
[BOTH CHUCKLING]

38:38.580 --> 38:39.672
>> I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU TAKING

38:39.680 --> 38:40.806
TAKING IT EASY MR. SABRI. NO

38:40.810 --> 38:42.516
MORE LONG DISTANCE TREKS ACROSS

38:42.520 --> 38:45.785
THE ROOM.

38:45.790 --> 38:50.159
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

38:50.160 --> 38:53.527
GOOD.

38:53.530 --> 38:55.088
LITTLE THICKENING OF THE SKIN.

38:55.100 --> 38:57.955
BUT SO GOOD SO FAR.

38:57.960 --> 38:58.790
YOU KNOW, ONCE WE'RE

38:58.800 --> 39:01.018
FINISHED WITH THESE SKIN GRAl-TS,

39:01.030 --> 39:01.962
WE'LL HAVE TO TALK ABOUT

39:01.970 --> 39:03.733
DANCING LESSONS. YOU

39:03.740 --> 39:05.901
DO A LOT OF DANCING WHERE YOU'RE

39:05.910 --> 39:07.502
FROM?

39:13.450 --> 39:16.169
>> WHEN I WOKE UP THIS MORNING,

39:16.180 --> 39:20.640
I NOTICED THEM. THEY MULTIPLIED

39:20.650 --> 39:23.778
AS THE DAY WENT ON.

39:23.790 --> 39:26.782
I HAD SUCH HOPE.

39:41.680 --> 39:44.069
>> ME, TOO.

40:06.970 --> 40:07.959
>> HAVE YOU SEEN MY NON-FAT

40:07.970 --> 40:08.834
BLUEBERRY?

40:08.840 --> 40:15.006
>> I'M EATING IT.

40:15.010 --> 40:17.934
>> WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO START

40:17.940 --> 40:19.669
LABELING THINGS.

40:19.680 --> 40:20.647
>> DOES THAT MEAN YOU'RE

40:20.650 --> 40:21.207
STAYING?

40:21.210 --> 40:22.211
>> I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE A LONG

40:22.220 --> 40:29.058
DISTANCE MARRIAGE.

40:29.060 --> 40:31.722
>> SO WHY THE CHANGE OF HEART?

40:31.730 --> 40:34.790
>> WELL, I FIGURE I'M GONNA HAVE

40:34.800 --> 40:35.994
TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR SORRY ASS

40:36.000 --> 40:36.955
ANYWAYS. SO I MIGHT AS WELL GET

40:36.960 --> 40:38.689
A BIG HONKING DIAMOND RING OUT

40:38.700 --> 40:41.897
OF IT, RIGHT? I MEAN, THERE'S

40:41.900 --> 40:43.834
NOT ONE LESBIAN I KNOW WHO COULD

40:43.840 --> 40:46.161
AFFORD ONE THAT BIG.

40:46.170 --> 40:47.933
>> YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

40:47.940 --> 40:51.205
> > I KNOW.

40:51.210 --> 40:53.041
BUT YOU KNOW LIKE THEY SAY,

40:53.050 --> 40:56.076
FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE.

41:02.960 --> 41:04.757
I KNOW YOU BETTER THAN YOU KNOW

41:04.760 --> 41:09.299
YOURSELF, CHRISTIAN.

41:09.300 --> 41:10.949
AND I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU DIE

41:10.960 --> 41:14.020
ALONE.

41:14.030 --> 41:16.237
>> LOOK AT IT THIS WAY. I'LL BE

41:16.240 --> 41:19.767
DEAD BEFORE WE CAN GET DIVORCED.

41:23.710 --> 41:24.779
>> WE HAVE A MEETING WITH A

41:24.780 --> 41:25.940
WEDDING PLANNER TOMORROW AT

41:25.950 --> 41:29.044
9:00. DON'T YOU BE LATE.

41:32.990 --> 41:37.108
>> NICE ASS.

41:37.120 --> 41:39.486
>> AND IT'S ALL YOURS.
