18:31.319 --> 18:34.658
reinvested

18:34.659 --> 18:39.159
getting that distinct impression that
you are only afternoon for my financial

18:39.159 --> 18:40.269
prowess

18:40.269 --> 18:43.358
nothing gets me hotter than knowing i'm
gonna be able to put up a good fight

18:44.409 --> 18:48.639
I'm glad I can help you out but my
clients that I deal with are big

18:49.329 --> 18:55.778
excuse me I'm a Councilwoman quite
possibly mayor someday and you're just

18:55.778 --> 18:57.548
getting started in this game

18:57.548 --> 19:02.138
yeah you have some stocks and mutual fun
but the investors that I deal with

19:02.138 --> 19:06.278
usually ante up with significantly
larger sons how much larger

19:10.849 --> 19:13.909
we just have a drink and talk about
something else

19:13.910 --> 19:18.740
I missed I want to know how much money
it's gonna take for me to come up with

19:18.740 --> 19:22.250
for you to take me seriously it

19:22.250 --> 19:27.380
I don't know 30 thousand on top of your
10,000 but even if you could come up

19:27.380 --> 19:27.950
with it

19:27.950 --> 19:32.690
I wouldn't put you in that kind of risk
you want to talk about risk

19:33.829 --> 19:38.839
I never jump into relationships like
this but I do trust my instincts when

19:38.839 --> 19:41.000
they tell me to go for it

19:41.000 --> 19:44.000
maybe it's time you step up to the plate

19:48.859 --> 19:51.859
ok you are not the only one taking a
leap of faith

19:55.019 --> 19:58.019
I can see a future for us together

20:00.339 --> 20:03.339
then show me the money

already put one of his clients in the

20:34.329 --> 20:35.199

yesterday

40:10.119 --> 40:13.480
thank you you're welcome

40:13.480 --> 40:18.429
chalk it up to experience Jenna I hope
this whole episode was a phony broker is

40:18.429 --> 40:19.869
going to take your edge off

40:19.869 --> 40:24.460
are you kidding I've learned a lot from
the Tactical Air you see I realized that

40:24.460 --> 40:28.179
I tried to control while with my
sexuality I shouldn't sleep with him on

40:28.179 --> 40:29.019
the first day

40:29.019 --> 40:33.550
well i would say that's a reasonable
policy to adopt you know don't get me

40:33.550 --> 40:37.450
wrong I enjoyed every minute I mean he
was an exceptional man but in retrospect

40:37.449 --> 40:40.629
it clouded my judgment do I really need
to hear all this

40:40.630 --> 40:43.630
you know what I should have done was
probably just kept on the chase made him

40:43.630 --> 40:46.630
think that he was in control and
actually I would've been the one in the

40:46.630 --> 40:47.440
driver's seat

40:47.440 --> 40:49.539
you know like it did with you

40:49.539 --> 40:53.529
notes and i know you liked him

40:54.130 --> 40:57.490
now you can talk all you want but he
hurt you

40:57.489 --> 41:00.489
and it's okay to admit once in a while
that you're human

41:01.000 --> 41:04.900
Sean how sweet your chance and you're
delusional

41:05.469 --> 41:08.469
typical

41:09.309 --> 41:13.420
thanks for showing me that no matter how
badly I feel there's always someone

41:13.420 --> 41:16.119
worse up

41:16.119 --> 41:23.920
I'm back Sean with a vengence rising

42:11.260 --> 42:11.800
yeah
