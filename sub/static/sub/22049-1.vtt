01:06.420 --> 01:11.060
I didn't think she was his type.
-Neither did I.

01:11.200 --> 01:13.900
When did they get together?
-Last weekend.

01:14.040 --> 01:15.180
Where was that?

01:17.780 --> 01:21.980
Jonas said that she gave him a blowjob on the toilet.

01:22.520 --> 01:25.400
Since when are you together after a blowjob?

01:26.500 --> 01:28.380
You're not together after that.

01:28.560 --> 01:32.080
They were already together in the 10th grade or something.
-Yeah.

01:32.080 --> 01:36.240
Who is this about?
-Eva, why?

01:43.040 --> 01:46.480
It's so sick that they got together.

01:46.560 --> 01:49.200
<i>[You look freaking hot in that shirt.]</i>

01:49.260 --> 01:52.520
One of the prettiest girls in Pepsi Max has a boyfriend.

01:52.660 --> 01:56.060
They fall in the same category as the Penetrator-boys.

01:57.280 --> 02:01.800
You guys! I have fantastic news.

02:02.540 --> 02:05.660
Are you ready?
-Say it.

02:06.160 --> 02:07.520
Are you excited?

02:11.860 --> 02:17.240
I have acquired "Brun og Blid" as a sponsor.

02:19.560 --> 02:21.380
What did you say?

02:22.760 --> 02:25.960
It's Norway's largest tanning salon chain.

02:27.440 --> 02:29.600
I know what "Brun og Blid" is.

02:30.620 --> 02:33.040
We will not be sponsored by them, no.

02:35.420 --> 02:36.180
Why's that?

02:36.660 --> 02:41.860
Because they contribute to the most speculative
and sexist market in Norway.

02:41.860 --> 02:43.860
Have you even seen their commercials?

02:44.500 --> 02:46.700
It's a tanning salon...

02:46.840 --> 02:52.300
... it's difficult to promote it without
showing tanned bodies.

02:52.960 --> 02:59.760
Noora, I worked really hard to get them to sponsor us.
You're just being really ungrateful.

02:59.900 --> 03:03.060
Can't you see how difficult it was to persuade them?

03:03.460 --> 03:07.500
So you think we should promote "Brun og Blid"?

03:07.960 --> 03:11.820
And contribute to a completely inhumane body pressure?

03:12.100 --> 03:14.600
I don't feel too much of that body pressure.

03:22.200 --> 03:25.540
I say we milk those sexist motherfuckers
for every penny they have!

03:28.480 --> 03:32.000
Okay... Oh my god, fucking cool.
Go for it.

03:32.160 --> 03:34.780
But then I'm not joining the bus anymore.

03:34.960 --> 03:37.440
Huh? Are you kidding right now?

03:40.260 --> 03:44.200
Noora, oh my god.
Just because things don't go your way?

03:44.360 --> 03:50.920
Now you're being really childish.
-It's just because I refuse to contribute to that inhumane body pressure.

03:52.360 --> 03:56.180
The logo is this small. Here.

03:56.220 --> 03:59.720
I don't understand how that will
contribute to body pressure.

04:00.320 --> 04:03.220
Yeah well, whatever.
I give up.

04:06.500 --> 04:08.640
Should we go as a gÃ¥-russ then?
(= graduate not participating in the Russefeiring)

04:08.840 --> 04:11.880
Vilde, it might come as a shock to you...

04:12.260 --> 04:18.960
... but Russebuss is not important to me.
I just wanted to get to know Eva and Sana.

04:20.980 --> 04:26.400
Wow, thanks for that!
-No! You too, Chris.

04:33.520 --> 04:35.780
This discussion isn't over!

05:21.420 --> 05:22.880
Yeah?

05:24.380 --> 05:27.700
Did you eat my pasta?
-No.

05:28.140 --> 05:31.020
Can you ask Eskild to turn down the music?

05:36.940 --> 05:38.320
Eskild!

05:42.560 --> 05:43.780
Eskild!

05:51.180 --> 05:52.580
Sorry!

05:58.400 --> 05:59.280
Noora?

05:59.780 --> 06:02.260
Can you lend me 200 Kroner until Monday?

06:03.320 --> 06:04.560
Yeah, okay.

06:58.900 --> 07:01.280
Hi!
-Hey.

07:04.540 --> 07:08.620
Do you need help?
-No, never.

07:11.640 --> 07:14.220
Hello.
-Hello. What's up?

07:14.720 --> 07:17.420
Netflix. Just Netflix...

07:18.900 --> 07:21.660
Do you have some food?
-Yeah, of course.

07:23.740 --> 07:29.260
I didn't have a chance to eat at home.
Too much guy-on-guy BJ action.

07:29.340 --> 07:32.280
No, what the fuck? Your parents, or what?

07:32.280 --> 07:36.080
I live in a shared apartment with roommates.
-Ah, okay.

07:36.740 --> 07:40.160
But I have actually seen my parents
in BJ action.

07:40.200 --> 07:42.500
No way! Seriously?

07:42.500 --> 07:45.400
I would have been scarred for the
rest of my life.

07:48.120 --> 07:53.080
What did she reply?
-"Come to my house and show me."

07:53.980 --> 07:58.160
Are you kidding?
She is stalling.

07:58.160 --> 08:00.160
What should I answer, then?

08:00.780 --> 08:04.920
Who is this?
A 00'er Jonas is involved with.

08:05.180 --> 08:10.560
I haven't even kissed her.
-But it's going to happen.

08:11.740 --> 08:15.180
I never want to hook up
with a 00'er!

08:15.300 --> 08:16.880
Then why are you chatting with her?

08:17.120 --> 08:20.260
Because she has a good body.

08:24.100 --> 08:31.760
Okay so... Jonas is flirting with a girl
and you're helping him?

08:32.880 --> 08:34.460
Eh... yeah.

08:37.800 --> 08:41.500
Wow! How is that working out for you?

08:41.500 --> 08:44.720
We're friends, so it works out just fine.

08:48.200 --> 08:49.620
Okay...

08:50.620 --> 08:53.780
What the fuck? She sent boobs!

08:53.780 --> 08:56.140
Are you kidding?
-No, look!

08:57.460 --> 09:00.680
Hey, you can't show that to us!
-Why not?

09:00.740 --> 09:03.000
Let me see! Screenshot it!

09:03.260 --> 09:05.240
Fucking hell, they are really nice.

09:05.980 --> 09:12.040
And she's a 00'er?
I bet she took a screenshot from a magazine or something.

09:12.080 --> 09:16.300
No, I don't think so. She got it to look
like this with a good black and white filter.

09:21.300 --> 09:25.380
I know the tricks. Shit!
Fuck. They are really big!

09:26.300 --> 09:28.480
One is a little higher up than the other.

09:29.200 --> 09:31.620
Now it's your turn. I'm sorry.

09:32.040 --> 09:34.840
Should I go and send stuff to people?

09:34.840 --> 09:38.240
You should send loads of dick pics, of course.

09:38.300 --> 09:39.920
I keep it real.

09:41.300 --> 09:48.300
It's not hard to do this.
-But it's hard to take screenshots?

09:48.880 --> 09:53.080
Set it as your background!
What school does she go to?

09:55.440 --> 09:59.500
We should talk about our sponsors.

09:59.580 --> 10:03.240
Because everyone should feel like they
have a say in the Russebuss.

10:03.400 --> 10:08.720
We are very different girls.
At the same time it's also important that we are strong and independent.

10:09.080 --> 10:17.160
But we have to have money.
I suggest a Russebuss meeting on Friday.

10:17.160 --> 10:22.220
Then everyone can talk properly
about the image and the concept.

10:23.380 --> 10:26.440
We'll drink wine and just enjoy ourselves.

10:26.440 --> 10:30.240
It's been so long since it was just us.

10:30.340 --> 10:35.040
For me, we don't really need to do this.

10:35.100 --> 10:37.120
It's not important to me.

10:39.940 --> 10:43.400
I have a party in Elvebakken on Friday, so..

10:43.820 --> 10:46.040
With who?
-With Jonas.

10:49.420 --> 10:51.640
I promised I would go with him.

10:53.760 --> 10:56.660
Come on! We're friends, okay?

10:56.860 --> 11:01.100
Why is it so hard to understand that you
can be friends with your ex?

11:01.100 --> 11:04.820
When you're a couple, it's the same thing as being
best friends. You just also have sex.

11:04.820 --> 11:09.960
We ended the sex part.
That doesn't mean we can't still be best friends.

11:11.980 --> 11:16.040
Did you hear William beat up someone
from Hansen this weekend?

11:26.440 --> 11:31.160
Who was it?
-A 98'er. He was properly destroyed.

11:31.160 --> 11:33.160
He ended up in the emergency room.

11:34.520 --> 11:36.620
Oh my god, so cool!

11:36.620 --> 11:40.220
I think William is very sensitive.

11:42.660 --> 11:45.680
He knows what it's like to lose someone.

11:45.680 --> 11:48.720
I think he's a fuckboy.
-What do you mean by losing someone?

11:48.720 --> 11:49.940
His little sister.

11:51.040 --> 11:55.060
He lost his little sister?
-Yeah, didn't you know?

11:55.460 --> 11:56.660
She's dead.

11:56.900 --> 12:00.420
A dead little sister. It's so tragic.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.960
When did this happen?
-A long time ago.

12:03.960 --> 12:07.700
Something like that really stays with someone.

12:09.720 --> 12:12.740
<i>[I like that you're sitting there looking at me.]</i>

12:12.740 --> 12:15.820
It's' so sad for him. I think that's why
he's a fuckboy.

12:16.600 --> 12:18.520
Because he knows what it's like to lose someone.
He doesn't want to lose anyone again.

12:18.520 --> 12:20.840
<i>[I'm not looking at you.]</i>
Because he knows what it's like to lose someone.
He doesn't want to lose anyone again.

12:20.840 --> 12:20.880
Because he knows what it's like to lose someone.
He doesn't want to lose anyone again.

12:24.540 --> 12:29.000
He's really a good guy. I noticed that
during Christmas.

12:29.880 --> 12:33.000
Right, Eva?
-What?

12:34.240 --> 12:36.720
That he's a really good guy.

12:38.100 --> 12:41.340
It seemed like he was really keen.

12:41.340 --> 12:44.400
Why else would he say you were hot?

12:44.400 --> 12:46.480
<i>[You still owe me a date. Friday?]</i>

12:46.480 --> 12:48.040
I actually don't remember what he said to me.
<i>[You still owe me a date. Friday?]</i>

12:48.040 --> 12:50.020
I actually don't remember what he said to me.

12:51.400 --> 12:52.540
Do you?

12:55.260 --> 12:57.000
Didn't he say something like.. "Vilde, I didn't mean what I said back then."

12:57.000 --> 12:59.520
<i>[Unfortunately, can't on Friday. Got something important.]</i>
Didn't he say something like.. "Vilde, I didn't mean what I said back then."

12:59.520 --> 13:01.360
Didn't he say something like.. "Vilde, I didn't mean what I said back then."

13:01.360 --> 13:01.740
<i>[What's that?]</i>
Didn't he say something like.. "Vilde, I didn't mean what I said back then."

13:01.740 --> 13:02.500
<i>[What's that?]</i>

13:02.500 --> 13:04.820
Then he said: "Whoever gets you, is fucking lucky."
<i>[What's that?]</i>

13:04.820 --> 13:08.100
Then he said: "Whoever gets you, is fucking lucky."

13:08.100 --> 13:10.800
<i>[Buss meeting. Russetiden preparation.
Most important thing in the world.]</i>
Then he said: "Whoever gets you, is fucking lucky."

13:10.920 --> 13:14.140
"Every guy that gets you is so fucking lucky."

13:14.140 --> 13:18.800
"Remember when I said you weren't good enough?
That was bullshit."

13:18.860 --> 13:21.820
"And every guy that gets you is fucking lucky."

13:22.500 --> 13:27.360
He's totally random though.
He came up to Noora and..

13:30.000 --> 13:32.180
Came up to Noora and then?

13:32.440 --> 13:33.400
Nothing.

13:37.820 --> 13:42.320
Vilde, it's never going to happen between me and William.

13:43.280 --> 13:49.440
He's the most unsympathetic, selfish person
I've ever met.

13:49.600 --> 13:51.900
I would never touch him.

13:52.100 --> 13:54.240
And you shouldn't either.

13:56.940 --> 14:00.160
You don't know him like I do.

14:00.320 --> 14:03.800
If you had just heard him at Chrismtas.

14:03.800 --> 14:07.520
How long can we talk about Christmas?
It's March!

14:07.600 --> 14:12.160
Just because he came over and apologised,
because he behaved like an asshole..

14:12.160 --> 14:15.540
.. doesn't mean he's a good person.

14:16.840 --> 14:19.920
And it doesn't mean he's keen on you.

14:19.920 --> 14:24.700
I'm not the one who said he was keen on me.
It was Eva who said that.

14:25.820 --> 14:29.940
I just don't want you to get your hopes up and-

14:29.940 --> 14:31.940
It's from William!

14:32.480 --> 14:36.100
"Penetrator party on Friday. Bring your bus group and come."

14:45.680 --> 14:50.740
Don't we have a bus meeting on Friday?

14:50.880 --> 14:53.680
I thought that wasn't important to you.

14:53.680 --> 14:58.880
I thought it was important to you
to be strong and independent?

14:59.020 --> 15:03.620
Yeah, but I can be strong and independent
at the Penetrator party.

15:04.380 --> 15:09.780
So we'll just drop all our plans,
because a guy calls.

15:10.160 --> 15:15.000
Can't we have a bus meeting first,
and then go to the party afterwards?

15:15.200 --> 15:17.000
That's exactly what we'll do.

15:17.680 --> 15:20.860
"We're coming." Heart.. heart?

15:22.960 --> 15:26.800
So then we'll have the bus meeting and the party,
and then you can go to that party with your best friend.

15:34.780 --> 15:36.480
<i>[You lose.]</i>

15:48.220 --> 15:49.340
Eskild!

15:52.440 --> 15:54.020
Eskild!

15:56.080 --> 15:57.700
Do you still need money?

16:04.220 --> 16:06.580
I need help with something.
-500 Kroner.

16:06.720 --> 16:08.600
200 Kroner.
-200 Kroner?

16:09.880 --> 16:11.660
400 Kroner.
-300!

16:12.820 --> 16:15.760
350! Last offer.
-350. Great.

16:16.140 --> 16:18.660
You have to make a move on one of my friends.

16:21.420 --> 16:22.760
Eh, yeah. Okay.

16:22.940 --> 16:27.060
Don't you think I'm gonna set off
some gaydars?

16:27.060 --> 16:31.160
No, oh my god. No stress.
She doesn't even know what gay is.

16:31.160 --> 16:33.160
She's so naive.

16:33.920 --> 16:35.980
Yeah great, okay.
Whatever.

16:36.040 --> 16:37.360
What do you want me to do?

16:37.360 --> 16:43.420
I'm having a bus party here tomorrow,
and you just walk in randomly.

16:43.420 --> 16:45.420
Is there alcohol for me?

16:47.600 --> 16:50.820
Sure!
Just be home around 7, okay?

16:52.940 --> 16:57.580
Do I have to make out with her?
-No, no, no. Oh my god.

16:57.580 --> 17:02.220
She just needs some attention.
Just some compliments and stuff.

17:02.220 --> 17:06.740
Because she's crazy obsessed with a guy
who isn't interested in her.

17:06.740 --> 17:10.100
So that's why I need you
to help her forget him.

17:10.620 --> 17:15.100
Okay. He'll be forgotten.
-Great!

17:15.100 --> 17:19.080
For 500 Kroner.
-No! I said 350!

17:19.080 --> 17:22.340
If I make out with her,
we'll say 500 Kroner.

17:22.340 --> 17:26.480
You don't need to make out with her!
-For 390 I'll touch her boobs.

17:26.480 --> 17:29.300
350! No making out and no boob touching.

17:29.300 --> 17:32.920
Just a little attention.
-350 and boob stroking.

17:32.920 --> 17:43.440
No. 350 and a little attention.
-If it goes well, I can touch her boobs a little.

17:44.580 --> 17:47.400
Oh my god, what the fuck?

17:47.400 --> 17:51.260
It's nothing. Just to know how it feels!

17:53.340 --> 17:56.780
.. with this here.
I thought something like..

17:56.780 --> 18:01.940
Up here it's classy, but here it's a little slutty.

18:01.940 --> 18:03.100
Didn't the bottles break?

18:03.100 --> 18:06.840
A white top is just stressful. If you spill something, it becomes transparent.

18:07.680 --> 18:10.280
Yes..
-Ah you'd like that, don't you?

18:10.320 --> 18:15.140
No Vilde! Take this.
That one was super pretty. Now you have to stop.

18:16.100 --> 18:19.960
I think I'm going to sleep with William tonight.

18:20.640 --> 18:21.760
Don't forget a condom.

18:21.760 --> 18:27.480
Are you going to sleep with Jonas tonight?
No, we're just friends.

18:27.480 --> 18:28.340
<i>[Where are you? Come home NOW!!]</i>

18:28.340 --> 18:29.900
So you guys haven't had sex
after you broke up?
<i>[Where are you? Come home NOW!!]</i>

18:29.900 --> 18:30.980
So you guys haven't had sex
after you broke up?

18:31.440 --> 18:35.200
No, I promise.
Last time we had sex was when we broke up.

18:35.280 --> 18:36.500
That's when you broke up?

18:38.320 --> 18:43.000
I'm serious, you have to try that once.
Fuck. The best sex I ever had.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.420
It was really amazing.

18:45.600 --> 18:48.500
Shouldn't you be sad after you've broken up?

18:48.880 --> 18:55.140
Well yeah, we were. But that was what made
it so hot. So intense.

19:01.600 --> 19:05.320
What?
-Are you sure it happened?

19:05.320 --> 19:08.900
That it wasn't a dream
or a flashback?

19:08.900 --> 19:11.840
Hey guys, can I ask something?

19:13.980 --> 19:17.340
Has anyone ever gone down on you?
-No.

19:17.740 --> 19:20.640
Yeah! Someone went down on me
in Gran Canaria last summer.

19:20.700 --> 19:22.880
Are you kidding me?
How was it?

19:22.880 --> 19:24.880
It was fucking nice.

19:25.120 --> 19:26.560
I sat there and just...

19:28.760 --> 19:31.940
Then it couldn't have been very...

19:31.940 --> 19:35.180
I'm really scared William will try
to go down on me.

19:35.180 --> 19:38.600
Vilde, there's no Norwegian guy
who will do it.

19:38.600 --> 19:42.460
It's true, while we suck
dick for dear life.

19:44.040 --> 19:47.820
Snapchat from William!
He's wondering when we're coming.

19:48.120 --> 19:54.240
When are you gonna go to Jonas'?
-We were supposed to call. I can call him.

19:54.240 --> 19:56.640
<i>[That snapchat to Vilde was
directed towards you.]</i>

19:57.520 --> 20:00.760
Can't we go in half an hour?

20:00.760 --> 20:02.400
<i>[You can't use Vilde this way.]</i>

20:02.500 --> 20:10.540
No, oh my god! Now we're going to talk
about image, concept.

20:10.540 --> 20:12.540
That's why we're here. Right?

20:12.820 --> 20:15.560
Yes. What kind of concept would you like?

20:22.520 --> 20:25.080
Jonas' phone is turned off or something.

20:29.320 --> 20:31.440
Hi!
-There you are!

20:33.520 --> 20:37.260
I'm having a bus party tonight.

20:38.620 --> 20:46.300
It's nice that you're here. These are my friends.
This is Eskild. He lives with me.

20:46.300 --> 20:50.120
Yeah, hi. Eskild.
Hi. Vilde.

20:51.740 --> 20:56.240
Eva, if you could...
I have some tomatoes...

20:57.980 --> 21:01.540
I'll sit here. Hi.

21:01.920 --> 21:03.720
Here.

21:05.300 --> 21:11.760
But eh... don't you have some wine?
-Yeah!

21:13.600 --> 21:18.700
Oh, Chabli! Hmm.
-From 19... eh 2010.

21:19.840 --> 21:22.940
Okay. Cheers!
-Cheers!

21:24.200 --> 21:27.760
Noora, what should I do with the tomatoes?
-You have really pretty eyes.

21:28.520 --> 21:29.960
You think so?

21:30.380 --> 21:32.840
You have a lot of eye make-up.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.240
It was Eva who did that.

21:37.060 --> 21:41.340
You shouldn't let her do it.
She's not really good at it.

21:41.620 --> 21:43.620
You're not a virgin, right?

21:44.400 --> 21:46.580
No I'm not.

21:48.120 --> 21:53.320
Can you see it?
-I might be a little direct now..

21:53.320 --> 22:00.280
I can see it from your breasts.
Once you've had sex..

22:00.280 --> 22:03.160
What's wrong with your phone?
Why is it turned off?

22:03.160 --> 22:05.160
Call me when you get this.

22:14.880 --> 22:17.500
This wine is good.
-Hello? Music?

22:17.720 --> 22:20.140
I want to put on some music!
Which phone is it?

22:20.140 --> 22:24.940
Let's dance!
Yes!

22:24.940 --> 22:26.940
It's Britney, bitch.

23:20.720 --> 23:24.540
It's William!
Hi?

23:28.100 --> 23:28.840
Yeah...

23:30.680 --> 23:31.860
Okay...

23:33.120 --> 23:35.660
It's William.
He wants to talk to you.

23:39.440 --> 23:41.220
Eh... To me?

23:46.340 --> 23:47.960
Yeah hello.

23:49.100 --> 23:52.120
I can't stop using Vilde
when you don't answer your phone.

23:53.320 --> 23:54.320
What is it?

23:54.760 --> 23:58.620
We wouldn't have been in this situation
if you had kept your promise.

23:59.340 --> 24:03.720
No. I don't have his number.

24:03.720 --> 24:05.720
Whose? Maybe I have it.

24:05.960 --> 24:12.180
You go on a date with me,
and then I'll stop using Vilde.

24:12.900 --> 24:13.820
Okay?

24:16.100 --> 24:18.400
Okay.
-Good!

24:18.820 --> 24:20.480
Let me speak to Vilde.

24:21.700 --> 24:23.680
He wants to talk to you.

24:26.720 --> 24:28.100
Hi!

24:33.020 --> 24:37.480
What a shame.
Yeah, I understand.

24:39.940 --> 24:41.820
Ok. Bye!

24:45.720 --> 24:51.180
There's no Penetrator party.
-Chris' parents came home.

24:51.720 --> 24:55.120
Can't we come along to your
Elvebakken party?

24:56.580 --> 25:01.820
Jonas isn't answering. He turned off his phone.
-Can we at least dance and have a party?

25:03.340 --> 25:05.800
Whose number did he want?

25:15.200 --> 25:19.960
<i>[Next Friday. 19.00h. I'll pick you up.]</i>

25:24.620 --> 25:26.160
Aren't you gay?
