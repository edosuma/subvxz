WEBVTT

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
325,000 inhabitants.

00:10.920 --> 00:14.000
Does anyone know how we're gonna find
these Nazis among all these people?

00:14.080 --> 00:16.240
Do you know the expression
"a needle in a haystack"?

00:16.840 --> 00:18.720
Yeah, it means
it'll be impossible.

00:18.800 --> 00:21.000
No, but it is going
to be very difficult.

00:21.080 --> 00:23.440
But with patience and hard work,
we'll find him.

00:25.640 --> 00:27.600
Deaf Man, the address
in Bachmann's locker,

00:27.680 --> 00:28.920
-did you find anything?
-Nothing.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.680
Do you think
you'll be able to recognize Heim?

00:32.200 --> 00:33.800
It's been a really long time, Isabel.

00:34.640 --> 00:36.440
Some things you never forget.

00:39.560 --> 00:42.760
I didn't go to
the commander of the camp's house often.

00:50.040 --> 00:51.640
His breath smelled like coffee.

00:52.640 --> 00:55.680
After lunch, he would have
one of those brown candies.

01:06.520 --> 01:10.040
I never understood how he could
do all those things to those people.

01:11.680 --> 01:13.640
We'll stay in the windmill.

01:13.720 --> 01:16.280
If there's any trouble,
we have a place to hide.

01:17.960 --> 01:20.040
"Those are not giants, my Lord."

01:20.120 --> 01:22.920
-"Those are not giants."
-What are you talking about?

01:23.000 --> 01:24.760
Nothing.

01:24.840 --> 01:28.200
-You said something.
-It's from Don Quixote.

01:28.280 --> 01:30.760
"Change the world, Sancho,
change the world,

01:31.360 --> 01:34.080
which is neither madness nor utopia,
but justice."

01:34.160 --> 01:37.000
-Whatever you say.
-Any problem, I'll meet you here.

01:37.080 --> 01:39.480
In the meantime,
let's find out where Bachmann is.

01:39.560 --> 01:41.280
Marsé, find out
where they could be staying.

01:41.880 --> 01:45.240
Castro and Deaf Man, check
if they have any property in the area.

01:45.320 --> 01:49.240
Isabel and I will try to find out what
that code we found in the locker meant.

01:54.200 --> 01:55.240
A NETFLIX SERIES

03:17.920 --> 03:21.480
EPISODE 4 - ALMERÍA

03:23.320 --> 03:25.480
-Did you find anything?
-Nothing.

03:25.560 --> 03:29.280
No one at this post office or any other
knows about the address Santa Tecla.

03:29.360 --> 03:31.320
-Not an address or a PO box?
-No.

03:50.040 --> 03:53.440
ONE DAY UNTIL THE ARRIVAL OF ARIBERT HEIM

03:57.120 --> 03:59.640
Hotels, motels,
boarding houses, and nothing.

03:59.720 --> 04:01.600
There's nobody under Bachmann's name.

04:01.680 --> 04:03.680
What about the registry?
Maybe he owns some property.

04:03.760 --> 04:05.160
Already checked. Nothing.

04:05.240 --> 04:07.720
-Did you also look for Ilse?
-Of course. But there's nothing.

04:07.800 --> 04:10.040
-They're like ghosts.
-Tell me you have something.

04:10.120 --> 04:12.080
-Nothing.
-We checked offices,

04:12.160 --> 04:16.480
company directories, hospitals,
residential areas, bungalows, doghouses…

04:16.560 --> 04:17.880
He's nowhere to be found.

04:17.960 --> 04:21.400
It seems nobody here has seen
a German giant with a scar on his face.

04:21.480 --> 04:22.840
We're doing something wrong.

04:22.920 --> 04:26.720
-Maybe he's not here.
-No. He's here. We have to keep looking.

04:28.800 --> 04:32.280
We're going to check out every bar,
nightclub and restaurant here.

04:32.360 --> 04:34.840
Bachmann likes women too much
to stay underground.

04:36.560 --> 04:40.720
The doctor told me I have to swim,
and I do it every day.

04:41.240 --> 04:44.800
But what I really like
is swimming in the sea, you know?

04:45.320 --> 04:48.760
Any day I don't go swimming, I go to bed
feeling like something's missing.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.320
How many beaches are here?

04:51.400 --> 04:53.080
A lot.

04:53.760 --> 04:56.200
Tomorrow morning,
we will need to watch them all.

04:56.280 --> 04:57.320
Why's that?

04:58.360 --> 05:00.640
Because if Ilse is here,
she'll be at one of them.

06:31.040 --> 06:32.440
We'll do six-hour shifts.

06:32.520 --> 06:35.080
If we see anyone who might be Heim,
we'll take a picture

06:35.160 --> 06:36.480
so Isabel can identify him.

06:36.560 --> 06:37.640
-All right?
-Yeah.

06:37.720 --> 06:40.080
-Yeah, okay.
-Okay. Go get some rest.

06:40.160 --> 06:41.440
I'll take the first watch.

06:59.040 --> 07:00.200
What are you drawing?

07:03.880 --> 07:06.000
I started writing a diary, you know?

07:09.640 --> 07:11.680
But them words alone were no longer…

07:14.440 --> 07:17.560
enough to describe
all the horror I witnessed in there.

07:49.880 --> 07:51.680
The cruelty was always present.

07:52.440 --> 07:54.560
But at night, it became
impossible to bear.

07:55.560 --> 07:59.160
We'd hear the dogs barking
and we knew new prisoners had arrived.

07:59.240 --> 08:02.880
Poles, Italians, Turks, didn't matter.
The dogs barked and barked and barked.

08:03.600 --> 08:06.040
From my barracks window,
I could see the Appellplatz.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.520
And the new arrivals were so close

08:08.600 --> 08:11.400
that I could see their faces,
I could smell their scent.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.960
I remember one night
a father and his son came.

08:15.480 --> 08:18.440
I don't know where they were from.
Lithuanians, I think.

08:18.520 --> 08:20.320
The commander separated them
from the group

08:20.400 --> 08:22.960
and told the boy
that if he hit his father with a stick,

08:23.040 --> 08:24.760
the commander would let him live.

08:24.840 --> 08:27.200
The boy couldn't have been
more than 15 years old.

08:27.280 --> 08:29.800
He was so scared that…

08:30.960 --> 08:33.240
in his terror, he hit
his father on the head with a stick

08:33.320 --> 08:35.800
and killed him right there,
in front of everybody.

08:35.880 --> 08:38.360
It took him a while
to realize what he'd done,

08:38.440 --> 08:41.520
and when he did, he knelt down crying,
hugging his father's corpse,

08:41.600 --> 08:43.560
screaming in a language no one knew.

08:44.200 --> 08:46.760
At the same time, we all understood
what he was saying.

08:47.320 --> 08:50.840
Then the commander unleashed the dogs,
which tore the boy apart.

08:51.760 --> 08:54.440
After that, the commander ordered
the rest of the prisoners

08:54.520 --> 08:56.880
to drag their corpses to the crematorium.

08:57.400 --> 08:58.880
It wasn't enough to kill us.

09:00.840 --> 09:02.280
They had to torture us.

09:05.960 --> 09:08.560
Cruelty reigned in Dachau.

09:11.800 --> 09:15.280
When they liberated the camp,
I went directly to the dog cages.

09:15.360 --> 09:18.320
The officers had already gone,
they'd left their dogs there.

09:18.400 --> 09:20.200
Even though I had no strength,

09:20.280 --> 09:22.920
I used a stone to crush their heads
one by one.

09:26.320 --> 09:28.440
Until they finally stopped barking.

09:32.680 --> 09:34.720
That way, they would never do it again.

09:41.720 --> 09:43.320
Until very recently…

09:46.480 --> 09:48.800
I didn't know if I'd be able
to do the same thing

09:48.880 --> 09:50.280
to their humans who kept them.

09:58.680 --> 09:59.600
But I could.

10:02.440 --> 10:03.280
Yes.

10:03.360 --> 10:04.400
No…

10:04.480 --> 10:05.400
Yes.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.080
I did it.

10:30.200 --> 10:31.200
Anything?

10:32.040 --> 10:33.040
-Nothing.
-Here.

10:33.560 --> 10:34.400
Thank you.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.120
There's someone there.

10:46.160 --> 10:47.600
i count four men. They're armed.

10:47.680 --> 10:51.120
Why would a couple who don't hire
security in Madrid use it here?

10:51.200 --> 10:53.480
Because the security isn't for them.

11:01.720 --> 11:02.840
Your turn.

11:10.760 --> 11:12.680
Tell me it's him. Tell me it's Heim.

11:16.560 --> 11:18.360
His back is to me. I can't see him.

11:22.480 --> 11:23.440
Come on.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.080
Did you see him?

11:31.240 --> 11:32.320
I can't.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.800
Isabel, did you see his face?

11:36.040 --> 11:37.000
Hmm.

11:47.200 --> 11:48.840
What the fuck are they doing?

11:51.400 --> 11:52.240
Damn it.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
Hey! Bachmann's leaving.
Go follow him, don't lose him.

12:04.520 --> 12:07.120
The driver's emptying the car's ashtray
in the trash.

12:17.880 --> 12:19.760
Well, now we know
what they had for breakfast,

12:19.840 --> 12:21.680
what they're eating,
drinking, and smoking,

12:21.760 --> 12:24.000
and that
they don't even finish their cigarettes.

12:27.200 --> 12:28.520
Have you found anything?

12:29.240 --> 12:30.840
Just trash and a foul smell.

12:33.360 --> 12:34.960
I'm going to relieve Marsé.

13:10.240 --> 13:11.200
Lucena!

13:13.720 --> 13:14.840
What is it?

13:17.560 --> 13:18.400
Coffee.

13:19.640 --> 13:20.720
And you're positive?

13:22.760 --> 13:24.920
I could never forget this.
It's him. It's Heim.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.080
-We can't make any mistakes.
-I'm sure about this.

13:27.160 --> 13:29.000
-How can you be so sure?
-Look at it!

13:31.080 --> 13:32.680
What else do you need?

13:33.640 --> 13:35.120
What else do you need?

13:35.200 --> 13:37.640
Something to convince me
we won't miss our chance.

13:37.720 --> 13:39.080
Anyone could have eaten that candy.

13:39.160 --> 13:42.920
You brought me here because I'm the only
one who's seen that bastard's face.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.960
-Instead I've been pawing through garbage!
-We need more!

13:46.040 --> 13:47.400
That wrapper doesn't mean anything!

13:47.480 --> 13:50.880
-Don't raise your voice at me again!
-Stop thinking this is only about you!

14:13.280 --> 14:14.960
There's a saying where I come from.

14:15.760 --> 14:17.120
"Water doesn't change."

14:17.960 --> 14:19.040
"We do."

14:22.720 --> 14:26.320
It's been a long time since I've been
back there. Not since the war started.

14:28.760 --> 14:30.200
Do you wanna go back?

14:30.280 --> 14:31.880
No. Why would I?

14:32.760 --> 14:35.160
That place is no longer my home.
There's nothing there for me.

14:39.160 --> 14:41.720
At least you know where you're from.
I don't even remember.

14:44.240 --> 14:46.520
I shouldn't have shouted at you.
I'm sorry.

14:49.160 --> 14:50.160
We need you here.

14:55.560 --> 14:56.960
You know the worst part?

15:01.240 --> 15:04.200
I always thought, when I saw the sea,
it would look bigger.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.080
Yeah, that's the right place.
The boat's called the Santa Tecla.

16:03.160 --> 16:06.720
Get a small boat. If they'll transport
him out like that, we'll need it.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.960
And, Castro? Good job, kiddo.

16:16.560 --> 16:18.840
-What?
-They found what the numbers were.

16:18.920 --> 16:21.040
They correspond to a berth
in a private port.

16:21.120 --> 16:23.520
-They plan to take him out by sea?
-The Santa Tecla's a boat.

16:23.600 --> 16:26.840
A small fishing boat, to be precise.
They can't get very far with it.

16:27.800 --> 16:29.240
And that means?

16:31.320 --> 16:32.680
It might just be a shuttle.

16:37.840 --> 16:40.200
The Nazis always planned
several escape routes.

16:40.280 --> 16:43.920
After Eichmann, I don't think they see
South America as a very safe place.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.480
You're thinking Africa.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.960
We can't let them reach the open sea,
or we'll lose him.

16:50.120 --> 16:52.920
Do they have good ones?
Yes, I'll say. Here you are.

16:54.160 --> 16:56.160
-Thanks a lot.
-No worries.

17:02.080 --> 17:03.480
Want to take it for a spin?

17:17.920 --> 17:19.200
What, are we out of gas?

17:21.120 --> 17:22.200
Holy shit.

17:23.720 --> 17:24.920
He said it was full.

17:33.240 --> 17:34.120
What?

17:45.640 --> 17:46.840
Deaf Man! What are you--

17:52.800 --> 17:56.560
-Deaf Man, what are you doing?
-Where did you go at night?

17:57.840 --> 18:01.440
I saw you were signaling from a window.

18:01.520 --> 18:03.440
-Where did you go?
-Please!

18:03.960 --> 18:06.120
Who did you meet with there? Huh?

18:06.640 --> 18:08.120
He's just a friend!

18:17.040 --> 18:20.440
You put us all in danger!

18:20.520 --> 18:22.840
A friend, I promise you, just a friend!

18:39.880 --> 18:43.080
He's nobody! He's nobody!
I don't know what it was!

18:43.160 --> 18:44.800
I don't know what it was!

18:54.400 --> 18:56.280
Have you ever been with a woman?

18:57.560 --> 18:58.400
Yes.

18:59.680 --> 19:00.520
Me too.

19:02.200 --> 19:04.280
I've tried being with a girl, but…

19:06.880 --> 19:09.600
I don't know, there's just always
something that doesn't…

19:10.480 --> 19:12.280
that makes it impossible, I don't…

19:13.080 --> 19:14.760
I don't know, I just can't.

19:18.040 --> 19:21.160
I don't know if what happened with him
is what I want either, but…

19:31.160 --> 19:34.000
I don't want to die
without knowing who I really am.

19:39.760 --> 19:40.800
Well…

19:46.240 --> 19:47.920
Huh. Raise your head.

19:51.080 --> 19:51.920
Huh.

20:02.920 --> 20:04.600
It's okay.

20:11.840 --> 20:13.880
-Anything?
-Nothing.

20:18.560 --> 20:20.400
What are you doing? Put that away.

20:21.280 --> 20:23.320
I got involved with you
for only one reason.

20:23.400 --> 20:26.120
To kill all those sons of bitches
for what they did to my father.

20:26.200 --> 20:28.920
-Do you know how many we've caught? Zero!
-Hey!

20:29.000 --> 20:32.080
But I've wasted my time my whole
fucking life, and I've had enough!

20:33.000 --> 20:34.760
Give me the gun.

20:38.240 --> 20:39.720
-Gonna shoot me?
-If you make me.

20:39.800 --> 20:41.120
-Then pull the trigger.
-Try me.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.240
Hey, hey, hey.

20:42.320 --> 20:43.840
Hey, hey, come on. Hey. The gun.

20:43.920 --> 20:45.760
Where's the gun? Give me the gun.

20:46.360 --> 20:47.440
Give--

20:47.520 --> 20:49.760
Give it to me. Stop. Stop. Hey.

20:49.840 --> 20:52.880
Hey. Hey! Look at me. Look at me.
Let him go. Let--

20:52.960 --> 20:55.120
-Let--
-What the fuck's going on here, Castro?

20:55.200 --> 20:57.880
-Leave him.
-We're not like them.

20:57.960 --> 20:59.680
Maybe we should be more like them.

20:59.760 --> 21:01.880
If it's not Heim, it's some other Nazi.

21:01.960 --> 21:04.840
If we go in and it's not Heim,
I assure you, we'll lose him forever.

21:04.920 --> 21:06.640
We won't get him or any other Nazi.

21:06.720 --> 21:08.320
Look at me. Look at me!

21:08.840 --> 21:11.760
-Get off me, Deaf Man. Fuck off.
-He's right this time.

21:11.840 --> 21:14.480
What if we use a decoy
to force them to come out?

21:14.560 --> 21:16.240
Let's set the house on fire.

21:16.920 --> 21:18.120
-Let's go.
-Yeah?

21:18.200 --> 21:20.200
Well, well, comrades.

21:22.160 --> 21:23.920
I think Castro has a point.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.200
-What?
-Somewhat, Deaf Man, somewhat.

21:26.800 --> 21:27.680
Somewhat.

21:28.640 --> 21:30.520
We have to get into that villa,

21:31.320 --> 21:33.320
but we can't fire a bullet, kiddo.

21:34.440 --> 21:37.840
Isabel is the only one
who can tell us if that guy in there is

21:38.560 --> 21:39.800
or isn't Heim.

21:39.880 --> 21:41.640
But you, me and and Isabel
can't go in there

21:41.720 --> 21:43.880
because Bachmann and Ilse
have seen our faces.

21:43.960 --> 21:45.800
You're right, Lucena. Let's see.

21:46.640 --> 21:48.680
Who said we have to go there for him?

21:49.280 --> 21:52.680
What we have to do
is bring that Nazi here. To us.

22:00.400 --> 22:03.800
Kiddo. Would you really dare
to shoot one of these?

22:31.560 --> 22:35.360
Good afternoon, sir. We've been notified
that there's been a power outage.

22:35.440 --> 22:36.480
Who is it?

22:39.800 --> 22:41.360
I'm sorry, am I at the wrong house?

22:41.440 --> 22:44.120
No, you're in the right place.
Our power has gone out.

22:45.120 --> 22:46.520
Do you know the reason?

22:47.960 --> 22:51.920
Who knows? My partner
is checking the wiring from the outside.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.640
We need to check
the house's circuitry as well.

22:54.720 --> 22:57.320
We're doing it up and down the street.
Mind if I come in?

22:59.520 --> 23:00.400
Wait here.

23:12.360 --> 23:13.720
You can come in.

23:24.520 --> 23:26.800
-You don't mind…
-Mind what?

23:31.560 --> 23:34.520
There have been a lot of robberies
in the area lately, you know?

23:34.600 --> 23:35.440
Yeah.

23:42.760 --> 23:45.680
-Everything all right?
-Excuse him, he doesn't understand.

23:46.400 --> 23:47.240
Yeah.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.200
Where's the fuse box?

23:50.160 --> 23:51.120
Follow me.

23:56.680 --> 24:00.800
Whatever caused the outage, it knocked out
the power to the whole neighborhood.

24:00.880 --> 24:03.360
-This is a real mess.
-Will this take much longer?

24:04.560 --> 24:05.400
Oh, look here…

24:06.200 --> 24:07.200
This is scorched.

24:07.800 --> 24:10.160
-And that means?
-Well, I don't know, ma'am.

24:11.240 --> 24:13.920
I'm gonna have to look at
all the outlets in the house

24:14.000 --> 24:15.840
to see how many need to be replaced.

24:18.760 --> 24:20.040
Go with him.

24:20.120 --> 24:22.120
He's to finish as soon as possible.

24:30.800 --> 24:32.960
There's no voltage.
It sure wasn't from here.

24:34.960 --> 24:35.800
You understand me?

24:37.480 --> 24:38.840
You don't understand.

24:39.800 --> 24:41.840
This is… It doesn't work.

24:41.920 --> 24:42.960
Kaput.

24:43.840 --> 24:45.080
Dead.

24:47.800 --> 24:49.840
Let's go upstairs.

25:33.240 --> 25:34.200
Nothing here.

25:34.960 --> 25:36.200
Where are you going?

25:36.280 --> 25:38.200
I have to check all the outlets.

25:38.280 --> 25:39.120
No.

25:39.880 --> 25:40.920
-I have to--
-No!

25:41.440 --> 25:43.200
Oh. Okay.

25:55.200 --> 25:56.840
Where's the toilet? I gotta pee.

26:02.080 --> 26:04.040
Would you-- would you like to come in?

26:05.080 --> 26:06.160
Wanna do it with me?

26:07.640 --> 26:08.920
Thank you.

26:10.440 --> 26:11.720
Idiot.

26:57.560 --> 26:59.600
Come on.

26:59.680 --> 27:00.600
Turn around.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.600
Come on.

27:29.880 --> 27:31.360
Hello?

27:37.720 --> 27:38.600
Hello?

27:39.360 --> 27:42.600
Either you come out now or I'll come in.
Do you hear me?

27:47.880 --> 27:48.800
Voilà.

27:49.920 --> 27:50.960
The power's back.

28:18.400 --> 28:21.520
-Do you have it?
-Deaf Man's developing it. Find anything?

28:21.600 --> 28:24.440
I've been told that on Sundays,
a freighter passes Almería

28:24.520 --> 28:27.040
At three a.m, it goes
to the nearest point on the coast.

28:27.120 --> 28:28.800
-Your source?
-Maritime traffic authority.

28:28.880 --> 28:30.480
-What's the destination?
-Egypt.

28:31.080 --> 28:33.080
To the port of Suez through the Canal.

28:33.680 --> 28:36.120
Very good. Keep an eye
on the Santa Tecla in case it sets sail.

28:36.200 --> 28:38.560
-And don't get separated from our boat.
-Got it.

28:40.840 --> 28:42.080
How's he doing?

28:42.160 --> 28:43.280
He's working on it.

28:43.880 --> 28:47.880
We know where they're taking him.
Our friend wants to see the pyramids.

29:12.520 --> 29:13.360
Is it Heim?

29:17.640 --> 29:21.400
I don't know. He has a beard and it's
covering the scar. I can't make it out.

29:27.600 --> 29:30.200
I've looked at them
more than a hundred times.

29:30.720 --> 29:33.320
And they're blurry.
I can't see well enough…

29:50.720 --> 29:52.400
This picture could be anyone.

29:58.080 --> 29:59.640
They're leaving. Let's go.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.240
-What are you doing, Marsé?
-I know a short cut.

31:02.080 --> 31:03.480
Don't shoot Heim!

31:30.280 --> 31:31.680
Oh, oh…

31:32.880 --> 31:34.720
Marsé. Marsé, are you all right?

31:34.800 --> 31:37.560
-Yeah. They're getting away. Go on.
-Lucena!

31:40.200 --> 31:41.840
Hey! On the ground!

31:41.920 --> 31:44.640
On the ground. Drop the gun! Don't move.

31:45.520 --> 31:47.120
Get up. Get up!

31:54.520 --> 31:56.760
-It's not him.
-What?

31:57.360 --> 31:58.480
It's not him!

31:59.240 --> 32:02.320
-Companions, they fooled us.
-Get in the car! Quick!

32:06.440 --> 32:07.320
No…

33:18.800 --> 33:20.920
Come on! Come on, come on, hurry up!

33:28.440 --> 33:30.680
Come on, comrades. Go, go, go!

33:59.520 --> 34:01.280
Bachmann! Lights!

34:01.840 --> 34:03.360
-Bachmann!
-It's him! Heim!

34:06.080 --> 34:08.000
Take cover! Take cover!

34:10.240 --> 34:11.280
Come on! Go!

34:38.080 --> 34:39.480
Are you all right?

34:42.840 --> 34:44.040
Everybody, get ready!

34:46.880 --> 34:48.760
Come on!

34:48.840 --> 34:50.080
Fire!

35:02.560 --> 35:04.160
They hit our engine!

35:07.640 --> 35:08.760
We're losing gas!

35:09.880 --> 35:12.600
If the boat stops,
we'll lose them. What do we do?

35:12.680 --> 35:15.720
Do whatever it takes!
But we can't let Heim get away!

35:20.600 --> 35:21.520
Fire!

35:31.600 --> 35:33.520
Comrades, get ready!

35:34.280 --> 35:35.800
Jump!
