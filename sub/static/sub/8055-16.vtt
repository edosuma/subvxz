WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:03.600
This is it for certain, okay?
I create a game show.

00:03.670 --> 00:06.104
Two people on stage, right?
They flip a coin.

00:06.172 --> 00:08.538
One of them has to perform
open-heart surgery.

00:08.608 --> 00:10.542
The other one has to receive
open-heart surgery.

00:10.744 --> 00:13.110
We call it
<i>Open-Heart Surgery.</i>

00:14.147 --> 00:16.672
How about this?
You buy a Gulfstream G-IV jet.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.684
Already interested.
Take the wheels off.

00:18.752 --> 00:20.743
Get 'em off of there.
Turn the jet into an apartment building.

00:20.887 --> 00:22.514
People could live inside
their own private jet.

00:22.589 --> 00:25.023
We're currently coming up with
business ideas for Jean-Ralphio

00:25.091 --> 00:28.060
'cause as of today,
his bank account is blowing up.

00:28.228 --> 00:30.423
I made my money
the old-fashioned way.

00:30.497 --> 00:32.931
<i>I got run over</i>
<i>by a Lexus</i>

00:34.534 --> 00:36.502
I still can't believe you won
all that money in the lawsuit.

00:36.569 --> 00:37.661
You barely got hurt at all.

00:37.737 --> 00:39.637
Do you want to get run over?
Because I know a guy.

00:39.706 --> 00:44.370
Super gentle. Minor scrapes and bruises,
major dollars and cents.

00:46.279 --> 00:48.076
I got it.
What are you amazing at?

00:48.148 --> 00:50.139
I know it. We both know it,
let's just say it at the same time.

00:50.216 --> 00:51.706
Creating spectacles.
...spectacles.

00:51.785 --> 00:54.982
No, I got it.
You create Pawnee's first and only

00:55.055 --> 00:58.718
high-end, all-media
entertainment conglomerate.

00:58.792 --> 01:00.919
Absolutely. That's absolutely
what I have to do.

01:01.594 --> 01:02.891
What does it mean?

01:03.029 --> 01:04.360
It means audio, video,

01:04.464 --> 01:06.591
movies, 3-D movies, nightclubs... Yeah.

01:06.666 --> 01:09.100
...iPhone apps. If it's entertainment,
you're involved.

01:09.169 --> 01:10.158
Yes, of course I am.

01:10.236 --> 01:11.225
And you call it...

01:11.638 --> 01:12.764
Entertainment 7Twenty.

01:12.839 --> 01:14.363
No!

01:14.441 --> 01:15.465
Why? Why?

01:15.608 --> 01:16.632
You gotta stop screaming.

01:16.709 --> 01:19.337
I will, I just get excited.
Why do we call it Entertainment 7Twenty?

01:19.412 --> 01:21.812
'Cause you're willing to go
around the world twice

01:22.382 --> 01:23.371
for your clients.

01:23.516 --> 01:24.540
That is unbelievable!

01:24.617 --> 01:26.050
But listen to me,
listen to me.

01:26.152 --> 01:28.814
I'm gonna need you on my team
to pull this off, all right?

01:28.888 --> 01:30.355
I can't do this without you.

01:30.990 --> 01:33.720
I don't know, man. I can't.
I'd have to quit my job.

01:33.827 --> 01:35.158
Okay, I'll do it
without you.

01:55.715 --> 01:57.376
I have some
very important news

01:57.517 --> 01:59.212
about our favorite mini-horse,
Li'I Sebastian.

01:59.285 --> 02:02.311
ALL: Yay!
Li'I Sebastian!

02:02.388 --> 02:03.582
He died last night.

02:03.690 --> 02:05.055
No.

02:05.125 --> 02:08.583
But we can take comfort in the
fact that he is in heaven now,

02:08.661 --> 02:11.152
doing the two things
he loves doing the most.

02:11.231 --> 02:13.563
Eating carrots and
urinating freely.

02:13.867 --> 02:17.132
RON: <i>When I walked in this morning
and saw the flag was at half-mast,</i>

02:17.203 --> 02:19.637
I thought, " All right.

02:19.706 --> 02:21.674
"Another bureaucrat ate it."

02:22.842 --> 02:25.367
But then I found out
it was Li'I Sebastian.

02:25.712 --> 02:27.543
Half-mast is too high.

02:28.248 --> 02:30.148
Show some damned respect.

02:30.316 --> 02:31.977
Because of all he's
done for the town,

02:32.051 --> 02:34.918
we are gonna be holding a
small memorial service for him.

02:34.988 --> 02:35.977
But for now,

02:36.055 --> 02:39.513
I think we should bow our
heads in a moment of silence.

02:44.297 --> 02:45.992
(UPBEAT MUSIC
PLAYING ON RADIO)

02:57.610 --> 02:59.305
I got it, thank you.

03:02.081 --> 03:06.711
It's times like this, when someone,
or some horse, passes,

03:07.620 --> 03:09.952
<i>that you really take</i>
<i>stock of your life.</i>

03:10.056 --> 03:12.024
<i>You look around you,</i>
<i>and you start to realize</i>

03:12.091 --> 03:14.252
<i>what it is</i>
<i>that you truly care about.</i>

03:14.661 --> 03:17.095
<i>For Li'I Sebastian,</i>
<i>I imagine it was</i>

03:17.230 --> 03:19.664
<i>good fresh oats,</i>
<i>a trough of water,</i>

03:20.366 --> 03:23.392
and a willing sexual partner.
Or non-willing.

03:23.469 --> 03:26.404
He was a horse, so I think
they had to do it either way.

03:27.340 --> 03:28.329
Hey...

03:31.144 --> 03:32.168
Hey, Ann, how's it going?

03:32.245 --> 03:34.975
You don't have to pretend. I know
you're supposed to meet Leslie here.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.642
But I'm also curious
about how it's going.

03:37.884 --> 03:39.715
Mmm-hmm. Leslie's busy,
she's working on

03:39.786 --> 03:41.378
the Li'I Sebastian
memorial service.

03:41.454 --> 03:44.480
But you know what? She did give
me this note to give to you,

03:44.557 --> 03:47.025
and she also wanted me
to kiss you deeply,

03:47.093 --> 03:49.061
which I'm going to have to pass on.
Okay.

03:49.195 --> 03:51.493
I really like my new
part-time job here.

03:51.564 --> 03:52.963
My office mate
moved down the hall

03:53.032 --> 03:55.398
so I have this
whole room just for me.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.135
And Ben and Leslie,
who secretly meet here...

03:58.938 --> 04:00.667
...forty times a day.

04:00.840 --> 04:02.364
(LAUGHING)

04:03.910 --> 04:06.344
She drew a kiss monster

04:06.412 --> 04:07.606
on the note.

04:08.548 --> 04:09.537
Yeah.

04:09.949 --> 04:12.816
Look, you guys are totally
welcome to use my office,

04:12.885 --> 04:16.218
just don't do
anything on my desk.

04:16.789 --> 04:18.723
Oh, we don't... You know.

04:19.325 --> 04:20.882
We just like to
work in the same place,

04:21.027 --> 04:22.619
and then we talk
and hold hands.

04:22.695 --> 04:24.822
Yuck, that's somehow worse.

04:24.897 --> 04:26.956
Yeah, it sounded
bad when I said it.

04:27.600 --> 04:30.364
From now on, we stop mourning
Li'I Sebastian's death,

04:30.436 --> 04:32.097
and we start
celebrating his life.

04:32.905 --> 04:35.100
That's what he would have wanted.
RON: Amen.

04:36.109 --> 04:39.567
We need to send that glorious
beast into the great beyond

04:39.646 --> 04:42.706
with a display that rivals
the Super Bowl half-time show.

04:44.317 --> 04:46.512
Also, the budget is $600.

04:46.586 --> 04:48.645
So maintenance is
gonna set up the stage.

04:48.721 --> 04:50.985
Ron will be laying
the ceremonial wreath.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.818
Leslie, there's a 13th century
Italian poem by Dante Alighieri

04:54.927 --> 04:56.918
that would be
very appropriate.

04:56.996 --> 04:58.861
Oh, Jerry,
that sounds wonderful.

04:58.931 --> 05:01.331
Okay, Andy, I need you
to write a memorial song.

05:01.401 --> 05:04.632
Something like <i>Candle in the Wind,</i>
but 5,000 times better.

05:04.704 --> 05:07.400
Easy.
Hey, if you want a song from Andy Dwyer,

05:07.473 --> 05:08.963
lead singer of Mouse Rat,
you should know

05:09.042 --> 05:11.101
he doesn't get out of bed
for less than $1,000.

05:11.177 --> 05:13.441
Well, he sleeps on a futon,
so we can give him 50 bucks.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.038
Sold.

05:15.114 --> 05:18.447
Okay, here is a memo with some
facts about Li'I Sebastian.

05:18.785 --> 05:20.776
I think you'll find yours
particularly interesting.

05:23.723 --> 05:25.918
It's just a list of facts.
What?

05:25.992 --> 05:28.426
Okay, mine says,
"You have a cute butt."

05:29.929 --> 05:31.760
That's weird.
Must be a typo.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.093
Yeah, Jerry,
it's probably a typo,

05:33.166 --> 05:35.293
because it probably should've said,
"You have a cube butt."

05:35.368 --> 05:36.357
(LAUGHS)

05:36.436 --> 05:37.425
'Cause your butt's
shaped like a cube.

05:37.503 --> 05:38.527
Yeah.

05:38.604 --> 05:41.300
The question is, why is my memo
different than everyone else's?

05:43.976 --> 05:45.603
(CHANTING)
Cube butt, cube butt.

05:45.678 --> 05:47.703
ALL: (CHANTING)
Cube butt, cube butt.

05:53.886 --> 05:55.877
Well, the good news is
this is just tendonitis.

05:55.955 --> 05:57.616
How is that good news?

05:57.690 --> 05:59.282
The other option
was shoulder cancer.

05:59.559 --> 06:01.083
Really?
No.

06:01.160 --> 06:03.594
Look, you exercise a lot.
You're in great shape.

06:03.663 --> 06:06.029
Little things like this happen
with men of your age.

06:06.099 --> 06:07.191
Men of my age?

06:07.266 --> 06:08.699
How old do you think I am?

06:08.768 --> 06:09.928
Forty-two.
(SCOFFS)

06:10.803 --> 06:13.567
I am 44, and I plan
to live to be 150.

06:13.806 --> 06:14.864
Okay.

06:14.941 --> 06:16.738
So. What's the cure?

06:16.943 --> 06:19.503
Get a time machine.
Go back to being 20.

06:19.579 --> 06:24.141
Dr. Harris, you are literally the
meanest person I have ever met.

06:24.417 --> 06:27.784
Okay, all the permits cleared
for the horse funeral.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.117
What was that tone?
What?

06:31.057 --> 06:32.046
Oh, nothing.

06:32.492 --> 06:34.585
I'm very sad about this.

06:34.660 --> 06:36.560
Question! Who's a genius?

06:36.629 --> 06:37.960
Answer, Tom Haverford.

06:38.030 --> 06:40.294
Reason,
Jean-Ralphio just started

06:40.366 --> 06:42.391
an exclusive,
high-end production company,

06:42.468 --> 06:45.198
and he's willing to put on Li'I
Sebastian's memorial service

06:45.271 --> 06:47.398
pro bono,
just for the pub.

06:48.274 --> 06:51.300
Pub is an abbreviation
for publicity.

06:51.778 --> 06:54.008
Jean-Ralphio is a clown.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.446
This is the memorial
for Li'I Sebastian,

06:56.516 --> 06:58.711
not double-coupon night
at a strip club.

06:58.785 --> 07:01.310
First off, double-coupon night
is an incredible value.

07:01.587 --> 07:03.578
Secondly, this guy
just started a business.

07:03.656 --> 07:05.487
He's my friend.
It would really help him out.

07:05.558 --> 07:08.789
Plus, I'm gonna oversee everything
and make sure it goes great.

07:09.729 --> 07:11.424
Okay, Tom, we trust you.

07:11.497 --> 07:12.521
Make us proud.

07:12.832 --> 07:14.356
Make him proud.

07:15.968 --> 07:18.061
Why don't you just
Photoshop that out?

07:20.339 --> 07:22.068
Hi, Ann Perkins.
Hi.

07:22.141 --> 07:23.904
How are you?
I'm dying.

07:24.310 --> 07:25.402
What?

07:25.711 --> 07:27.178
Tendonitis.
Oh.

07:27.980 --> 07:30.141
I don't know if you should
lead with "I'm dying."

07:30.516 --> 07:32.848
You're right,
you're right. So.

07:32.919 --> 07:33.977
What's up with you?

07:34.053 --> 07:37.648
I'm just helping Leslie plan Li'I
Sebastian's memorial service.

07:38.891 --> 07:41.553
Li'I Sebastian died?
That's terrible.

07:41.627 --> 07:45.688
Yeah, well, he was old,
and he had a lot of ailments.

07:45.765 --> 07:46.789
Like tendonitis?

07:46.866 --> 07:47.855
I don't know.

07:47.934 --> 07:49.492
I don't have his
chart in front of me.

07:49.569 --> 07:51.332
Could you get it?

07:51.404 --> 07:53.497
What? No...
There's no chart.

07:53.573 --> 07:54.972
Oh, my God.

07:55.741 --> 07:57.231
Death is inescapable.

07:58.611 --> 08:00.545
Goodbye, Ann Perkins.

08:03.683 --> 08:06.243
Okay, so I'm meeting him in
a few minutes. How do I look?

08:06.519 --> 08:07.611
What are you going for?

08:07.687 --> 08:09.780
Sophisticated with
a hint of slutty.

08:09.856 --> 08:11.255
Bulls-eye.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.258
So nice to see you
so happy about a guy.

08:13.392 --> 08:15.622
Thanks. I don't know.
When I look at my life right now,

08:15.695 --> 08:18.027
it feels almost perfect.

08:18.197 --> 08:20.097
I mean,
we have to sneak around,

08:20.166 --> 08:22.600
but weirdly,
it's kind of fun that nobody knows.

08:22.702 --> 08:23.862
I could see that.

08:23.936 --> 08:25.528
Enough about me.
How's Ann?

08:25.605 --> 08:27.368
I'm pretty happy
right now, generally.

08:27.807 --> 08:30.674
Although I did see Chris today.
He always just throws me off.

08:30.743 --> 08:32.573
I don't want to talk about Chris.
Every time I hear his name,

08:32.645 --> 08:34.669
I think about the fact that he's
gonna find out about me and Ben,

08:34.746 --> 08:36.009
and he's gonna
fire both of us.

08:37.383 --> 08:39.647
And about how
much he hurt you.

08:39.719 --> 08:40.913
Yeah, there you go.
Yeah.

08:49.028 --> 08:50.552
Hello, Leslie.

08:50.630 --> 08:52.621
How long have you
been sleeping with Ben?

08:56.335 --> 08:57.529
What?

08:57.603 --> 08:59.434
How long have you
been sleeping with Ben?

08:59.872 --> 09:01.567
That's disgusting and wrong.

09:01.641 --> 09:03.404
I don't even get...
Why would... I...

09:03.476 --> 09:05.501
I've never had sex
with anyone anywhere.

09:05.578 --> 09:06.806
It's none of your...

09:06.879 --> 09:09.939
You have the nerve,
the audacity...

09:10.249 --> 09:12.149
Ben is my boss,
technically.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.584
And he is terrible,
facewise.

09:14.654 --> 09:17.919
And how...
How do I know, frankly,

09:17.990 --> 09:19.014
that you're not
sleeping with him?

09:19.091 --> 09:21.582
Maybe you are.
Maybe you're trying to throw me off.

09:21.661 --> 09:22.992
Hmm. Check and mate.

09:25.097 --> 09:27.691
This is an outrage!
Who do I call?

09:27.767 --> 09:29.735
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey.

09:29.802 --> 09:32.498
Hey, Ron. Listen, you're
just who I was looking for.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.904
Are you...
Did you forget the...

09:35.875 --> 09:37.536
Did you...
Can I get that thing?

09:37.610 --> 09:39.100
Can we just...

09:39.178 --> 09:40.270
Did you bring it?

09:40.346 --> 09:42.211
This isn't convincing.

09:44.350 --> 09:45.578
How did you find out?

09:45.651 --> 09:47.414
We've worked together
for a while now.

09:47.486 --> 09:49.181

10:16.682 --> 10:18.343

I'm sad you had to die.

wings and learn to fly.

10:46.445 --> 10:47.537
Horses don't fly.

10:49.415 --> 10:51.383

"dead" so much.

11:17.810 --> 11:19.402

You're helping me already.

11:21.881 --> 11:24.907

gonna say anything.

a situation could arise

11:33.659 --> 11:35.923

11:35.995 --> 11:37.394
and I congratulate you.

11:37.463 --> 11:39.727
Like, with
a professional hug.

11:40.299 --> 11:42.062
You know,
kind of like this,

11:42.835 --> 11:44.496
"Oh, congratulations."

11:44.937 --> 11:46.131
That feels appropriate.
Yeah.

11:46.205 --> 11:47.968
Yeah, I mean, I think we can
get away with that

11:48.040 --> 11:50.736

do stuff like this.

12:31.984 --> 12:33.713
So glad I found you.

12:34.086 --> 12:35.849
Can I talk to
you for a minute?

Um, okay.

12:38.390 --> 12:39.379
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

12:39.792 --> 12:42.090

a question,

12:42.228 --> 12:44.560
and if you're uncomfortable
answering it right now,

12:44.630 --> 12:48.726
you can take some time and think
about it. That would be okay.

12:49.902 --> 12:50.891
Okay.

12:51.670 --> 12:54.537
Is tendonitis symptomatic
of something larger?

12:55.274 --> 12:58.141
Really, that's the question
you wanted to ask me?

12:58.244 --> 12:59.404
I'm just very worried.

12:59.478 --> 13:01.503
I'm not sure that this
doctor's been properly trained.

13:01.580 --> 13:05.141
You know what, Chris? I'm sorry,
but I'm not your nurse,

13:05.217 --> 13:07.617
and I'm not your
girlfriend and...

13:07.686 --> 13:10.382
I thought I was twice,
and I was wrong,

13:10.756 --> 13:11.745
which was embarrassing.

13:11.824 --> 13:15.157
I'm just not ready
to be your friend.

13:15.995 --> 13:17.792
Of course. I'm sorry.

13:19.064 --> 13:21.794
I do hope we can be
friends before I die.

Hey.

Hey.
Hey.

13:29.542 --> 13:32.204
What you saw was not
what you think it is.

13:32.278 --> 13:35.975
I was just congratulating her
because she got some good news.

13:36.081 --> 13:37.275
Oh, right.
Yeah.

the hug was all about.

Sure. Congratulations.

We'll cover
your duties here.

You should just take
the rest of the day off.

13:52.765 --> 13:54.460
Oh, that's a good idea.
You should do that

13:54.533 --> 13:56.364
and you should
get a massage.

13:56.435 --> 14:00.633
I have a gift certificate, actually.
My mom gave it to me for you.

his facial hair.

20:06.338 --> 20:08.135
And we burned it off.

20:08.607 --> 20:11.633
This thing that we're doing,
it's unsustainable.

20:11.710 --> 20:12.768
What, you want
to break up?

20:12.844 --> 20:13.833
What? No. I like you.

20:13.912 --> 20:14.901
Well, then...

20:14.980 --> 20:16.038
You want to tell Chris.

20:16.114 --> 20:17.547
What? No. I like my job.

20:17.616 --> 20:19.049
Well, then, what do we do?

20:19.117 --> 20:20.982
Okay, operation shutdown.

20:21.587 --> 20:23.248
No more secret hand-holding.

20:23.322 --> 20:25.517
No more smooching
in Ann's office.

20:25.591 --> 20:28.116
In fact, when we're at work, we just
shouldn't talk to each other at all.

20:28.193 --> 20:31.162
Okay, well, that's gonna be really hard,
and we could still get fired.

20:31.230 --> 20:35.064
I know. But it's worth the
risk if I can be with you.

20:35.834 --> 20:36.960
All right.

20:37.035 --> 20:38.502
Well, then, I'm in.

20:38.570 --> 20:39.559
What are you doing?
Are you kidding me?

20:39.638 --> 20:41.401
I'm sorry.
No, it's force of habit.

20:41.506 --> 20:42.700
So what do I do, Ron?

20:42.774 --> 20:45.834
Do I stay here or roll the
dice with Jean-Ralphio?

20:45.944 --> 20:48.674
I can't tell you what to do.
Go with your gut.

20:48.780 --> 20:53.479
My gut's really small. It's easily
irritated. I need someone to guide me.

20:53.552 --> 20:55.315
You have no interest
in government work,

20:55.387 --> 20:58.754
and you slow everything down
with your selfish attitude.

20:59.424 --> 21:01.984
I'd love for you to
stick around, Tommy.

21:02.060 --> 21:04.551
It'll be damn hard
to replace you.

21:05.063 --> 21:06.724
But I'll support
you either way.

21:06.798 --> 21:09.528
Two of my lovers in one place.
What a coincidence.

21:10.902 --> 21:11.960
Tammy.

21:12.037 --> 21:13.402
Hello, Ron.

21:14.306 --> 21:16.001
Ooh, what happened here?

21:16.074 --> 21:19.475
And more importantly,
does the carpet match the face?

21:19.544 --> 21:22.206
If you're looking for trouble,
take it somewhere else.

21:22.281 --> 21:26.047
An hour ago, a giant fireball
consumed my entire face.

21:26.351 --> 21:29.320
And it was far preferable to
spending another second with you.

21:30.389 --> 21:32.289
Tell that
to your pants-tent.

21:33.258 --> 21:35.419
It's just
the way I'm standing.

21:35.661 --> 21:38.459
Go back to the library,
where you belong.

21:41.566 --> 21:42.828
Hey, Glenn.

21:42.901 --> 21:43.925
Wanna dance?

21:44.069 --> 21:45.093
No, I'm okay.

21:45.671 --> 21:46.831
Just one dance?

21:46.905 --> 21:48.270
No.
With mommy?

21:52.444 --> 21:56.676
You know, tendonitis
is usually caused by overuse.

21:56.748 --> 21:58.841
Have you been working
out more than usual?

21:59.184 --> 22:01.277
I did do 10,000
push-ups last week.

22:02.020 --> 22:05.080
Oh, really.
That might have something to do with it.

22:06.191 --> 22:08.216
You need to relax.
You're in great shape.

22:08.560 --> 22:09.754
For a 44-year-old.

22:09.995 --> 22:11.587
Yeah. That's how old
you are, man.

22:13.198 --> 22:15.359
You're right.
I've been overreacting.

22:15.634 --> 22:17.033
I don't like
thinking about death.

22:17.102 --> 22:19.764
Death is the opposite of...

22:21.106 --> 22:22.698
Being alive?

22:23.642 --> 22:24.973
Exactly.

22:25.043 --> 22:26.476
Look at us.

22:26.545 --> 22:27.534
Talking like friends.

22:27.679 --> 22:28.703
Yeah.

22:29.381 --> 22:30.939
What the hell. Friends.

22:31.550 --> 22:33.108
Ann Perkins.

22:33.185 --> 22:34.516
Chris Traeger.

22:36.121 --> 22:40.888
CHRIS: <i>What's the point in doing 10,000
push-ups if you're gonna do them alone?</i>

22:40.959 --> 22:44.554
I'd much rather do 5,000
push-ups with a wonderful woman.

22:45.564 --> 22:48.260
Sitting on my back to
increase my resistance.

22:48.333 --> 22:51.200
Copy of our new hit single,
<i>5,000 Candles in the Wind,</i>

22:51.269 --> 22:55.205
and the new full-length CD,
<i>The Awesome Album.</i>

22:55.307 --> 22:57.104
Eighteen bucks each,
$40 for the set.

22:57.709 --> 22:58.869
That doesn't add up.

22:59.611 --> 23:01.010
You don't add up.

23:01.546 --> 23:02.638
Okay.

23:04.750 --> 23:06.547
ANDY: Honey,
you are awesome at this.

23:06.618 --> 23:07.846
APRIL: Thanks.

23:09.788 --> 23:11.415
April, I need
to ask you something,

23:11.490 --> 23:14.584
and it's the biggest thing I've ever
asked anybody in my entire life.

23:15.026 --> 23:16.118
Honey,
we're already married.

23:16.194 --> 23:18.662
No, this is way more
important than that.

23:19.331 --> 23:20.923
April Ludgate,

23:21.233 --> 23:23.064
would you be my manager?

23:23.769 --> 23:25.100
Seriously?

23:25.704 --> 23:27.331
Okay. Yeah.

23:40.385 --> 23:41.716
Excuse me.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.017
Are you Leslie Knope?
Yes.

23:44.089 --> 23:45.647
My name is William Barnes.

23:45.724 --> 23:47.157
Do you have a minute
to talk?

23:47.225 --> 23:48.214
Sure.

23:48.293 --> 23:50.318
We really enjoyed
the service.

23:50.395 --> 23:52.920
That fireball
was truly amazing.

23:52.998 --> 23:54.659
I'm glad.
'Cause it was planned.

23:54.733 --> 23:56.963
And you were also responsible for
the Harvest Festival, correct?

23:57.035 --> 23:59.026
Well, a lot of people
contributed to that.

23:59.104 --> 24:01.732
You don't have to be modest.
We know it was you.

24:01.807 --> 24:03.001
You did an amazing job.

24:03.141 --> 24:04.369
Thank you.

24:04.443 --> 24:06.911
We are part of a group
that tries to identify

24:06.978 --> 24:10.607
potential candidates for
political office here in town.

24:10.682 --> 24:12.741
And we think that
you might fit the bill.

24:15.153 --> 24:16.142
Oh.

24:16.588 --> 24:17.646
Wow.

24:17.722 --> 24:20.122
Which office in particular?

24:20.192 --> 24:23.923
Well, there are a couple city council
seats we think are vulnerable.

24:23.995 --> 24:26.862
And the mayor's term
is up next year.

24:27.265 --> 24:28.254
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

24:28.333 --> 24:30.096
All we need to
know right now is

24:30.168 --> 24:32.796
are you theoretically interested
in running for office?

24:32.871 --> 24:34.395
Absotootly, I am.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.441
Very sorry that I
just used that word.

24:36.508 --> 24:38.601
But yes. I just...

24:40.045 --> 24:42.809
I've dreamed about this moment
for a long time.

24:43.381 --> 24:45.178
Guess I'll be
heading home.

24:45.250 --> 24:47.878
Catching the number 12 bus
to Satan's butthole?

24:47.953 --> 24:50.888
Actually, I prefer
the number 69 train

24:50.956 --> 24:52.355
to Humpsville station.

24:52.958 --> 24:54.118
DONNA: Red alert, Swanson.

24:54.192 --> 24:56.023
Your ex-wife is back.

24:56.094 --> 24:57.527
No kidding, Donna.

24:57.596 --> 25:00.429
Not her.
The other ex-wife.

25:03.001 --> 25:04.229
Tammy One.

25:04.302 --> 25:06.099
She's in your office.

25:09.674 --> 25:10.663
(BLEEP)!

25:12.978 --> 25:14.036
Would I have to
quit my job?

25:14.112 --> 25:16.205
Well, that's
a long way off.

25:16.281 --> 25:17.714
Of course.
But listen.

25:17.883 --> 25:20.613
When you run,
even in a local election,

25:20.685 --> 25:22.585
your life
becomes an open book.

25:22.654 --> 25:24.884
So if you so much as
stiff a waiter on his tip

25:24.956 --> 25:29.120
or use a government stamp for
personal mail, it will come out.

25:29.194 --> 25:30.821
So before
we go any further,

25:30.896 --> 25:32.022
I need you to tell me,

25:32.631 --> 25:34.064
is there
a scandal out there?

25:34.132 --> 25:38.330
Is there anything at all you
need to tell us about your life?

25:42.841 --> 25:43.933
Nope.

25:44.876 --> 25:46.002
All right.

25:46.077 --> 25:48.045
Well, we'll be in touch.

26:05.630 --> 26:08.121
Yeah, I think we can
do that for a million.

26:08.199 --> 26:10.167
Okay, we'll talk soon.

26:10.235 --> 26:11.725
There was no one on the
other end of that phone call,

26:11.803 --> 26:13.361
but soon there will be.

26:13.438 --> 26:15.804
Welcome to the Dreamatorium,

26:15.874 --> 26:18.707
A.K.A. the headquarters
of Entertainment 7Twenty.

26:18.777 --> 26:20.335
It's only two blocks
away from City Hall,

26:20.478 --> 26:22.036
but it's a whole
new world over here.

26:22.247 --> 26:25.683
We got a pool table,
a ping-pong table, a lounge area,

26:25.750 --> 26:27.342
a couch with a ceiling on it,

26:27.419 --> 26:29.751
in-house DJ. DJ Blunt.

26:29.821 --> 26:31.083
And best of all,

26:31.156 --> 26:34.717
former NBA superstar Detlef
Schrempf is on retainer.

26:34.793 --> 26:36.124
What's up, Detlef?

26:36.227 --> 26:39.162
Hey, Jean-Ralphio,
who's sitting in my clear purple desk?

26:39.230 --> 26:40.322
What?

26:40.465 --> 26:41.591
Who's this person?

26:44.970 --> 26:46.631
Are you talking about this
little sweetie right here?

26:46.705 --> 26:48.730
Yeah.
That is our new assistant, Tessa.

26:48.807 --> 26:52.106
I saw her sweating real sexy
on the StairMaster at Bally's.

26:52.177 --> 26:56.045
I need petty cash. My iPhone cover's
gross and I need to get a new one.

26:56.181 --> 26:57.409
Get it to match
your personality.

26:57.549 --> 26:58.777
Petty cash, money bowl.
Go diving.

26:59.718 --> 27:00.707
Gross.

27:00.819 --> 27:03.253
Why do we keep our petty cash
in a clear plastic toilet bowl?

27:03.321 --> 27:04.788
I don't know,
maybe 'cause we're...

27:04.856 --> 27:08.314
BOTH: (SINGING)
<i>Flush with cash</i>

27:08.693 --> 27:11.321
So, Tom, what does
this business do, again?

27:11.463 --> 27:14.523
It's a multimedia entertainment
production conglomerate.

27:15.000 --> 27:17.560
I don't know, man.
You have a lot of overhead here.

27:17.636 --> 27:19.399
Ever thought about
scaling back a bit

27:19.537 --> 27:21.300
and focusing on
building your client base?

27:22.073 --> 27:23.404
(LAUGHING) Thanks a lot,
<i>Forbes</i> magazine.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.705
But we didn't hire you
to give us business advice.

27:25.777 --> 27:27.369
We hired you to look pretty
and shoot baskets.

27:27.445 --> 27:28.810
So why don't you head over
there and do your thing?

27:28.880 --> 27:31.212
We want people to see you
when they come in, Detlef.

27:31.483 --> 27:35.078
We may not have any clients yet,
but we're about to blow up.

27:35.787 --> 27:38.051
First you set up the pond,
then you reel in the fish.

27:38.123 --> 27:39.385
Big D, hit me!

27:39.524 --> 27:41.549
Uh-oh, uh-oh,
uh-oh, uh-oh.

27:41.660 --> 27:42.922
Come on.

27:43.028 --> 27:44.928
We're living the dream.
