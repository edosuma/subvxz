Is he or is he not an engineer?

14:04.147 --> 14:05.975
Well, yeah, but...

14:08.369 --> 14:10.850
Scofield.

14:10.893 --> 14:12.852
Yeah?

14:12.895 --> 14:14.375
What do you know
about the electricity?

14:14.418 --> 14:16.420
Only that we don't
have any right now.

14:16.464 --> 14:18.248
Let me tell you something.

14:18.292 --> 14:21.208
This phone keeps all the food
coming to the gate.

14:21.251 --> 14:23.427
It keeps my business running,
it keeps Sona running.

14:23.471 --> 14:25.299
Electricity die,
phone die.

14:25.342 --> 14:27.344
Phone die, we die.We die or you die?

14:27.388 --> 14:29.390
Boy, you have enough

14:29.433 --> 14:31.479
education, but you're
not being smart.

14:31.522 --> 14:34.395
Now, I come to you,
that is an opportunity.

14:34.438 --> 14:36.527
Be wise
and take advantage.

14:36.571 --> 14:38.486
Now, can you fix the electricity

14:38.529 --> 14:40.270
just like you
fixed the water?

14:40.314 --> 14:41.619
It's not that simple.

14:41.663 --> 14:43.186
The water pipes
are inside the prison.

14:43.230 --> 14:45.623
The electrical lines are
probably running underground

14:45.667 --> 14:47.321
along an exterior wall,

14:47.364 --> 14:49.366
which means
they're out there somewhere

14:49.410 --> 14:51.760
in no-man's-land.

14:51.803 --> 14:54.371
So, you can fix the power?

14:54.415 --> 14:56.852
Last I checked, they shoot
prisoners who go out there.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.072
So I'm thinking
the answer is "no."

15:01.335 --> 15:02.640
You listen to me,

15:02.684 --> 15:04.425
and you listen closely,
water boy.

15:04.468 --> 15:07.471
Like it or not, soldiers or not,

15:07.515 --> 15:09.734
you're going out
into no-man's-land.

15:17.525 --> 15:18.569
MICHAEL:
It's a suicide mission.

15:18.613 --> 15:20.223
LECHERO:
I'll make some calls.

15:20.267 --> 15:22.704
And you're going to keep
me safe?
As best I can.

15:22.747 --> 15:24.184
I don't think
I can do this.

15:24.227 --> 15:26.534
No, no, no, no, no.
You will help me with this.

15:26.577 --> 15:28.405
Look, I will do
something for you.

15:28.449 --> 15:29.885
I'll get you a new pillow,

15:29.929 --> 15:32.235
goose-feather like mine,
or a small TV.

15:34.020 --> 15:35.543
All right.

15:35.586 --> 15:36.805
Get me that.

15:38.502 --> 15:41.810
Why?
It's the first one
to get sunlight in the morning.

15:41.853 --> 15:44.682
You get me that cell,
I'll get you electricity.

15:56.085 --> 15:58.522
[door opens]

15:58.566 --> 16:00.655
Hey, Linc.

16:09.403 --> 16:13.015
Look, bro, um, I'm going to be
out of your way real soon.

16:13.059 --> 16:15.583
I saw these flyers
for migrant workers in Colombia.

16:15.626 --> 16:17.063
It's coffee bean season,

16:17.106 --> 16:18.281
and they're letting
Panamanians in,

16:18.325 --> 16:22.590
so I figure,
with a good ID, I can pass.

16:22.633 --> 16:24.113
Bus leaves today, okay?

16:24.157 --> 16:27.247
All right, well, before you
get out of here, man, I...

16:27.290 --> 16:29.292
I'm meeting someone,
and I need a translator.

16:29.336 --> 16:32.643
Linc, uh... I appreciate
everything you've done...

16:32.687 --> 16:34.602
It'll just be a couple hours.

16:34.645 --> 16:36.212
Just a couple hours,
that's it.

16:36.256 --> 16:38.823
When I was 15, my cousin told me
about a job that only lasts

16:38.867 --> 16:40.869
a few hours and, uh,
I got three months in juvie.

16:40.912 --> 16:42.958
I can't do this without you.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.655
I'm in Panama,
I don't speak the language...

16:44.699 --> 16:45.961
And I can't miss that bus.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.224
I'm going to make money
and send it home.

16:48.268 --> 16:50.139
Underground or not,
I'm going to be a dad, Linc,

16:50.183 --> 16:52.707
and you out of all people
should understand that.[knock at door]

16:59.540 --> 17:00.845
[box cutter protracts]

17:07.635 --> 17:09.637
I spoke to James.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.682
He confirmed what you told me

17:11.726 --> 17:13.858
about the escape.

17:14.903 --> 17:17.558
You and I,
we both have people in there

17:17.601 --> 17:19.038
we care about.

17:20.561 --> 17:23.694
Please... let me help you.

17:25.087 --> 17:27.176
Your Spanish as good
as your English?

17:28.569 --> 17:30.701
LECHERO:
Yes, Colonel.

17:30.745 --> 17:32.703
I just have one favor to ask.

17:32.747 --> 17:34.531
It's just outside
of the gate.

17:34.575 --> 17:36.751
You, you can bring your men.

17:36.794 --> 17:39.710
The phone is dying.

17:43.671 --> 17:44.759
Make him one.

17:56.684 --> 17:58.512
This is it?

17:58.555 --> 17:59.817
Not everyone has it yet.

17:59.861 --> 18:02.124
We let credit go a week,
and there is still time.

18:02.168 --> 18:05.388
The money's in
your veins, addicto.No, patrón!

18:05.432 --> 18:07.521
No, patrón.
I don't use anymore.
I swear to you.

18:07.564 --> 18:09.653
I swear to you.

18:09.697 --> 18:12.439
I swear to you.
I swear to you.

18:19.968 --> 18:22.275
Chin up,
pal o' mine, chin up.

18:23.493 --> 18:24.755
[phone rings]

18:29.760 --> 18:31.414
Sí, Colonel.

18:31.458 --> 18:32.807
Yes, thank you, Colonel.

18:32.850 --> 18:34.635
We'll be right there.

18:34.678 --> 18:36.985
Come with me.

18:40.597 --> 18:41.859
Excuse me.
Do you, um...

18:41.903 --> 18:45.689
Do you have a-a, a pen?

18:45.733 --> 18:47.561
Pen. Pen. Not, um...

18:47.604 --> 18:48.736
Not... not the brush

18:48.779 --> 18:50.564
but the pen. Pen. Pen.

18:50.607 --> 18:51.739
No, pintura.

18:51.782 --> 18:53.175
Yeah, yeah, pintura. Yeah.

18:58.006 --> 19:02.141
[buzzer sounding,
indistinct PA announcement]

19:09.800 --> 19:10.932
HAYWIRE:
He's leaving you.

19:10.975 --> 19:12.977
He's leaving you,
he'll be gone,

19:13.021 --> 19:16.981
and you'll be stuck
in this maze... forever.

19:17.721 --> 19:19.810
[groans]

19:23.031 --> 19:24.206
Thank you for arranging
this for us, Colonel.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.339
I'm getting something
out of this as well,

19:26.382 --> 19:27.601
I assure you.

19:27.644 --> 19:29.472
You know you can fix
this electric problem?

19:30.560 --> 19:32.649
I won't know for sure
until we can start digging,

19:32.693 --> 19:35.565
but yes, I think so.

19:35.609 --> 19:36.697
My men will

19:36.740 --> 19:38.264
shoot you in the
back of the head

19:38.307 --> 19:40.788
if you so much as
look at the fence, eh?

19:40.831 --> 19:44.008
And you, patrón,
if anything goes wrong.

19:44.052 --> 19:46.576
it will not only be
his life that is lost.

19:46.620 --> 19:47.795
You have my word on that.

19:47.838 --> 19:50.624
No worries, Colonel.

19:50.667 --> 19:52.191
I'll keep this boy in line.

19:56.456 --> 19:57.631
I'll dig.

19:57.674 --> 19:58.849
I don't need your help.

19:58.893 --> 20:00.199
Hey, come on, now,
don't be proud.

20:00.242 --> 20:01.765
I heard you talking
just yesterday.

20:01.809 --> 20:03.376
Talking to Mahone.

20:03.419 --> 20:06.292
You know, about how
us Americans should
stick together.

20:06.335 --> 20:08.816
So I help you now,
and I'm sure you'll

20:08.859 --> 20:11.210
help me down the
road, right, Mikey?

20:14.648 --> 20:16.867
[tapping]

20:16.911 --> 20:19.653
What is it,
a '66 or a '67?

20:19.696 --> 20:21.829
¿Perdon?Your car.

el ano.

20:30.359 --> 20:32.143
Uh-huh.
What is it, 325 horses?

20:32.187 --> 20:34.494
SOFIA:
¿Caballos de fuerza?

20:34.537 --> 20:36.844

20:36.887 --> 20:38.367

20:39.238 --> 20:41.631
Perdon a me, señorita.Mm-hmm.

20:41.675 --> 20:44.982

20:45.026 --> 20:46.854
What's he saying?He recognizes me, but

20:46.897 --> 20:48.334
he doesn't realize
it was at the prison.

20:48.377 --> 20:50.336
Ask him does he want
to make enough cash

20:50.379 --> 20:51.772
to get this car cherry
by next week?

20:51.815 --> 20:54.557
[speaking Spanish]

21:00.259 --> 21:03.827
He knows we're
not talking
about cars.

21:03.871 --> 21:05.264
That's right.

21:07.004 --> 21:09.093
BELLICK:
Come on, Scofield, I know
you're getting out of here.

21:09.137 --> 21:10.878
I heard it all about
you and the limey.

21:10.921 --> 21:12.401
I'm just fixing the
electricity, boss.

21:12.445 --> 21:14.316
Yeah, right, and I'm just
single 'cause I'm choosy.

21:14.360 --> 21:16.187
Don't make me tell
anyone what I know.

21:16.231 --> 21:18.102
What is it you think you know?

21:18.146 --> 21:19.713
Somebody called "the Company"
wanted you in here

21:19.756 --> 21:21.323
to work with that
Whistler guy.

21:21.367 --> 21:22.890
Am I warm?
What's the Company?

21:22.933 --> 21:24.674
What do they want
with Whistler?

21:24.718 --> 21:25.936
I don't know, but you do.

21:25.980 --> 21:28.722
Doesn't sound like you
know much after all.

21:28.765 --> 21:29.636
I don't need to know

21:29.679 --> 21:31.028
how to change a diaper

21:31.072 --> 21:32.813
to know when it
stinks to high hell.

21:32.856 --> 21:34.641
You're doing something
here, Scofield.

21:34.684 --> 21:36.904
You're right. I am.

21:36.947 --> 21:38.906
I'm fixing the electricity.

21:38.949 --> 21:40.864
Now, you wanted to help dig?

21:40.908 --> 21:41.996
Dig.

21:43.954 --> 21:48.002
[indistinct PA announcement]

22:04.540 --> 22:05.672
[clanging]

22:05.715 --> 22:08.152
Hey, this is it.

22:22.732 --> 22:24.734
I assume we're doing more than
just than playing electrician.

22:24.778 --> 22:26.257
Don't worry.

22:26.301 --> 22:28.477
We're exactly
where we need to be.

22:45.146 --> 22:47.757
Heat's getting to me, Scofield.

22:47.801 --> 22:50.020
It's quitting time.

22:55.461 --> 23:00.161
You mind telling me why he's
even out here with us?

23:00.204 --> 23:02.642
He knows something's up.

23:02.685 --> 23:04.034
How the hell does he know that?

23:04.078 --> 23:05.993
Let's just say I have
a bit of a rep.

23:06.036 --> 23:07.516
From Fox River?

23:10.824 --> 23:13.217
I know who you are, mate.

23:13.261 --> 23:14.828
Figured it out just lately.

23:14.871 --> 23:17.134
Finally made sense
why they pick you

23:17.178 --> 23:19.485
of all people
to send here.

23:19.528 --> 23:21.095
No worries.

23:21.138 --> 23:23.576
It's in my interest to keep
your little secret.

23:23.619 --> 23:24.968
But Bellick?

23:25.012 --> 23:27.188
Can't be trusted.

23:27.231 --> 23:28.972
I can handle Bellick.

23:29.016 --> 23:30.844
He's not in on this.

23:30.887 --> 23:32.889
Okay, good.

23:32.933 --> 23:34.761
But Mahone is.

23:34.804 --> 23:36.197
Mahone?

23:36.240 --> 23:38.286
He's looking about as stable
as a three-legged chair,

23:38.329 --> 23:40.070
and he's escaping with us?

23:40.114 --> 23:42.072
No, he just thinks he is.

23:42.116 --> 23:44.161
He needs his meds.

23:44.205 --> 23:46.120
Without them,
he'll self destruct.

23:46.163 --> 23:47.730
It's just a matter of time.

23:49.863 --> 23:51.430
And if he doesn't?

23:51.473 --> 23:53.954
I'll string him along,
tell him what he wants to hear,

23:53.997 --> 23:57.436
and then I'll
cut him loose.

23:57.479 --> 23:59.960
How do I know you're not going
to do the same thing to me?

24:00.003 --> 24:02.266
You don't.

24:17.543 --> 24:19.414
You need a hook-up,
my friend?

24:22.678 --> 24:23.679
No.

24:23.723 --> 24:25.115
Take your time.

24:25.159 --> 24:27.204
I don't hard sell.

24:27.248 --> 24:29.293
My product speaks
for itself.

24:29.337 --> 24:32.296
Outside, I took something.

24:32.340 --> 24:36.910
It's a prescription
drug called Varatril,

24:36.953 --> 24:40.348
and I was
wondering if you...

24:40.391 --> 24:42.306
This ain't no farmacia.

24:42.350 --> 24:44.395
But what I got
right here...

24:44.439 --> 24:46.180
it's better than
anything your doctor

24:46.223 --> 24:48.051
gave you back
in the States.

24:48.095 --> 24:49.270
That's tar.

24:49.313 --> 24:51.968
Just take a taste,
algo pequeñito.

24:52.012 --> 24:53.187
You know, keep it in check.

24:53.230 --> 24:56.364
I don't have any money
right now.

24:57.060 --> 24:59.149
Then I don't have any drugs.

24:59.193 --> 25:02.065
But there are a few
ways for a man

25:02.109 --> 25:03.371
to make a few dollars in Sona...

25:03.414 --> 25:05.112
servicing
the needs of others--

25:05.155 --> 25:06.113
not something I'm into...

25:06.156 --> 25:07.549
You think I'm a punk?

I'm just helping you

get well, friend, just
helping you get well.

25:23.086 --> 25:24.523
Señor Lechero?

25:25.785 --> 25:26.916
Señor Lechero.

25:26.960 --> 25:28.875
What do you want?

25:28.918 --> 25:31.312
Look, I know you're a busy man,
but I wanted to tell ya,

25:31.355 --> 25:32.879
I don't know exactly
what he's doing,

25:32.922 --> 25:35.142
but Michael Scofield's
taking you for a ride.No, cerdo,

25:35.185 --> 25:36.578
I don't think so.

25:36.622 --> 25:38.711
Listen, I heard him talking
about escape yesterday--

25:38.754 --> 25:41.104
about breaking outta here.It's he's talking
about escape,

25:41.148 --> 25:43.672
why are you here telling me and
you're not going with him, eh?

25:44.891 --> 25:48.242
I would if he'd let me,
but he's already cut me out.

25:48.285 --> 25:49.417
He says he's square, but I know

25:49.460 --> 25:51.027
the son of a bitch
is up to something.

25:51.071 --> 25:52.463
So I figured,

25:52.507 --> 25:54.117
if I ain't running,
I might as well tell you

25:54.161 --> 25:56.250

a little bit easier.

about escaping from Sona.

in no-man's-land with shovels.

26:00.689 --> 26:02.996
I'm gave him the shovels.
Get him out.

26:03.039 --> 26:05.433
I gave him shovels too,
and guys to work with,
just like you.

26:05.476 --> 26:07.566
I worked in the prison
he broke out of.

26:10.351 --> 26:12.527
He said he was
doing me a favor--

26:12.571 --> 26:16.009
fixing damage
from a fire he started.

26:16.052 --> 26:17.401
And you know what I got?

26:17.445 --> 26:19.142
Hog-tied and left in a pipe
under my own prison.

26:19.186 --> 26:21.405
[keys clattering]

26:21.449 --> 26:24.234

are watching him.

26:25.192 --> 26:26.541
That's what I thought,

26:26.585 --> 26:28.325
until he tunneled out
of my guard's room.

26:28.369 --> 26:31.198
He's buried something
in a junction box out there

26:31.241 --> 26:33.113
and covered it with dirt--
I saw him.

26:33.156 --> 26:34.418
Go see for yourself.

26:34.462 --> 26:37.247

Trouble keeps finding you
here in Sona, doesn't it?

that you are trying to trick me.

I'm just doing what I'm told.

26:56.397 --> 26:59.269
Oh? Let's hope for your sake
that's true.

26:59.313 --> 27:00.662
Hmm?!

27:00.706 --> 27:02.142
But just to make sure,

27:02.185 --> 27:03.578
let's go on out
to no-man's-land

27:03.622 --> 27:06.276

27:51.757 --> 27:54.107
That's why the power
was so inconsistent.

27:54.150 --> 27:56.587
I didn't want the tape
to come loose,

27:56.631 --> 27:58.807

with dirt.

28:06.293 --> 28:07.642
Where are you going?

28:07.686 --> 28:10.645
I got to turn the main
power switch back on.

28:10.689 --> 28:13.953
I had to turn it off, so we
could work on the wires safely.

28:13.996 --> 28:15.084
I'll come with you.

28:15.128 --> 28:16.216
It's just a switch.

28:16.259 --> 28:17.347
I can handle it myself.

28:17.391 --> 28:19.872
You can... but you won't.

it's back here.

28:37.280 --> 28:39.326
I don't need the chain,
just the cross.

28:39.369 --> 28:41.632
It's the perfect size
and it's not real gold,

28:41.676 --> 28:43.678
so it won't
conduct current.

28:46.246 --> 28:47.290
Keep the
circuit open--

28:47.334 --> 28:49.205

the main switch

28:49.249 --> 28:50.424
is turned on.

only by my grace, Michael.

40:07.230 --> 40:09.972
Now, you remember
the next time that

40:10.016 --> 40:11.887
you're going to send me
on a goose chase.

40:11.931 --> 40:13.062
Okay?
I didn't.

40:13.106 --> 40:14.499
No, no. You did.

40:14.542 --> 40:16.675
And you think
you can manipulate me,

40:16.718 --> 40:22.985
just like you did to Sucre...
and Tweener

40:23.029 --> 40:24.900
and Haywire.

40:24.944 --> 40:27.468
I'm not your errand boy.

40:27.512 --> 40:29.470
And I'm going to go
with you when you escape,

40:29.514 --> 40:33.474
and if you think,
in any way...

40:33.518 --> 40:35.041
[laughs]

40:35.084 --> 40:37.217
...that you'll leave me,

40:37.260 --> 40:39.872
I will put this piece
of metal right in that

40:39.915 --> 40:41.961
very small space

40:42.004 --> 40:44.442
right between your eyes.
I will.

41:04.897 --> 41:07.552
[man speaking Spanish]

41:07.595 --> 41:09.118
[latch clicks]

41:11.207 --> 41:14.123
How's LJ? How's Sara?

41:14.167 --> 41:17.126
They told me they're fine.

41:17.170 --> 41:18.693
Listen, uh,
the grave digger

41:18.737 --> 41:19.955
is gone.

41:19.999 --> 41:21.130
What do you mean,
he's gone?

41:21.174 --> 41:24.830
Linc, we can't
do this without him.

41:24.873 --> 41:27.267
We know, we know, that's
why we went to his supervisor--

41:27.310 --> 41:30.139
the guy who approves
any hires for that job.

41:30.183 --> 41:33.491
Turns out
he could use some cash.

42:30.025 --> 42:32.724
♪

42:36.292 --> 42:40.383
[speaking indistinctly]

42:42.255 --> 42:44.605
This is how
we're getting out?

42:44.649 --> 42:45.780
Yes.

42:45.824 --> 42:47.956
With a little help
from an old friend.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.610
What is that?

42:49.654 --> 42:51.220
Kesslivol.

42:51.264 --> 42:52.613
It's a chemical
that kills the odors

42:52.657 --> 42:54.484
caused by
decomposing bodies.

42:54.528 --> 42:58.576
And when heated to
a certain degree...

43:05.278 --> 43:07.410
...it eats through steel.
