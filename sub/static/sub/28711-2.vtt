WEBVTT

00:19.193 --> 00:20.933
[Abby]
Previously on Swamp Thing...

00:21.021 --> 00:22.805
How long
has it been since
you were home?

00:22.892 --> 00:24.546
My name is Dr. Abby Arcane,

00:24.633 --> 00:26.983
with the CDC's  Epidemic Intelligence Service.

00:27.070 --> 00:28.593
Abby Arcane!

00:28.680 --> 00:30.421
Liz.

00:30.508 --> 00:31.988
Have you seen
anything unusual
at the docks lately?

00:32.075 --> 00:34.251
I have heard whispers
of someone hiring boats

00:34.338 --> 00:35.731
to go out into
the swamp at night.

00:35.818 --> 00:37.950
Excuse me?
Who are you exactly?

00:38.038 --> 00:39.996
You're gonna wanna
speak to me
sooner or later.

00:40.083 --> 00:41.867
Matt?
You're a cop now.

00:41.954 --> 00:43.304
Mr. Coyle?

00:43.391 --> 00:45.132
We have it under control.
It's okay.

00:45.219 --> 00:46.524
Well, nothing's
working, is it?

00:46.611 --> 00:47.917
-Who are you, again?
-Holland.

00:48.004 --> 00:49.832
There's something special
about this place,

00:49.919 --> 00:51.616
we all know that.

00:51.703 --> 00:53.792
You live here long enough,
you feel it in your bones.

00:53.879 --> 00:55.664
This is a sample.

00:55.751 --> 00:57.666
This clear shit on top,
that's just swamp water, right?

00:57.753 --> 00:59.363
But right there on the bottom,
you see that?

00:59.450 --> 01:01.104
That doesn't belong.

01:01.191 --> 01:02.845
It's gotta be some sort of
biological accelerant.

01:02.932 --> 01:05.152
But it only jacks up mutagens.

01:05.239 --> 01:06.631
[screams] Daddy!

01:06.718 --> 01:08.242
May I offer you a drink?

01:08.329 --> 01:09.808
I sure as hell could use one.

01:09.895 --> 01:13.247
[chuckling] That's two things
we have in common.

01:13.334 --> 01:15.162
[Alec]  The stuff in the box,
it's a biological accelerant.

01:15.249 --> 01:16.467
It's like the stuff we pulled
from the swamp.

01:16.554 --> 01:18.817
So someone's dumping it here?

01:18.904 --> 01:19.818
-Can I help you?
-[gun fires]

01:24.345 --> 01:25.520
[Abby] Alec!

01:27.870 --> 01:28.914
Alec?

01:30.394 --> 01:31.178
[gasps]

01:36.400 --> 01:38.576
[owl hooting]

02:08.345 --> 02:09.651
[siren whoops]

02:09.738 --> 02:11.783
[indistinct chatter
on police radio]

02:24.753 --> 02:26.407
[Matt] Abby, you circled round.

02:26.494 --> 02:27.843
Been through this area twice.

02:27.930 --> 02:29.279
We can't stop, Matt.

02:29.366 --> 02:30.715
-He could still be alive.
-Could he?

02:32.282 --> 02:33.805
You said the entire boat
went up in flames,

02:33.892 --> 02:35.329
and it sure looks like
that's what happened.

02:38.201 --> 02:40.377
[siren blares]

02:41.465 --> 02:43.032
Sheriff's here.

03:02.573 --> 03:04.227
Found any remains?

03:04.314 --> 03:06.360
We probably won't find much.
The whole thing went up.

03:06.447 --> 03:08.536
Reason?

03:08.623 --> 03:10.886
Maybe a spark from the engine
ignited the fuel tank.

03:10.973 --> 03:13.062
Wait, you think
this was an accident?

03:13.149 --> 03:14.063
Abby.

03:16.370 --> 03:18.850
You let your hair grow.

03:18.937 --> 03:20.939
You should know that
Alec Holland was investigating

03:21.026 --> 03:22.941
illegal dumping on this swamp,

03:23.028 --> 03:25.117
dumping he thought
might be related to this
current outbreak--

03:25.205 --> 03:28.251
And you should know,
if I've learned one thing
from being sheriff here,

03:28.338 --> 03:30.645
there's all kinds of awful
that happens in this swamp.

03:30.732 --> 03:33.909
But I think you know that.
Better than anyone.

03:35.650 --> 03:36.825
Landry!

03:38.392 --> 03:40.307
-Landry!
-[Landry] Yeah, boss?

03:40.394 --> 03:42.744
Start down the shore
and work your way back up.

03:42.831 --> 03:44.136
[Landry] Copy that.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.095
Call from the other side,
contour sweep.

03:46.182 --> 03:47.618
Wait. Wait. Listen,
you have to warn your people.

03:47.705 --> 03:49.272
I saw something out
there on the water.

03:49.359 --> 03:50.142
[Matt] Abby, this might not
be the best time...

03:50.230 --> 03:52.101
It was something big.

03:52.188 --> 03:52.971
Abby, we get reports
of boar in the area
all the time.

03:53.058 --> 03:54.321
It was not a boar.

03:54.408 --> 03:55.670
-It was a man. It was...
-Come on...

03:56.975 --> 03:58.020
It was like a man.

03:58.107 --> 03:59.543
[Matt] It was dark.

03:59.630 --> 04:01.589
You were keyed up
from the explosion.

04:01.676 --> 04:02.851
Now, she could have...
She could've seen
something on two legs.

04:02.938 --> 04:05.375
I don't know...
A bear.

04:05.897 --> 04:07.725
[scoffs]

04:07.812 --> 04:09.553
Yeah, maybe a grizzly wandered
all the way down from Canada

04:09.640 --> 04:11.120
for the first time ever.

04:13.862 --> 04:17.082
Dr. Arcane, go home.

04:17.169 --> 04:20.956
Landry, tell your people to be
on alert for a possible bear.

04:21.043 --> 04:22.697
[Landry]  Bear? In this swamp?

04:22.784 --> 04:24.525
Whatever you say, Sheriff.

04:43.718 --> 04:45.676
[beeping]

04:59.690 --> 05:01.605
[beeping quickens]

05:07.698 --> 05:09.439
[beeping rapidly]

05:18.274 --> 05:19.493
[alarms beeping]

05:52.743 --> 05:57.313
[roaring]

06:00.490 --> 06:02.449
[theme music playing]

07:04.989 --> 07:08.732
[Abby] You know, I thought
I knew what I was getting into
coming back to Marais, but...

07:08.819 --> 07:11.256
[Liz] This place wasn't
very easy for you.

07:11.343 --> 07:13.389
Even on the best of days.

07:13.476 --> 07:17.393
[Abby] Yeah. Anyway...
Thanks for letting me stay.

07:17.480 --> 07:22.833
Well, when it's this
or the Bide-A-Wee Motel
on Route 12...

07:22.920 --> 07:25.270
But they wouldn't
have a shot of bourbon
waiting for you.

07:27.751 --> 07:29.449
[softly] Two things
we have in common.

07:30.188 --> 07:31.233
What?

07:33.670 --> 07:34.454
Nothing.

07:36.586 --> 07:37.544
So, you heard.

07:39.502 --> 07:42.418
About the night
you had? Oh, yeah.

07:42.505 --> 07:44.986
I like to fall asleep listening
to the police scanner.

07:45.073 --> 07:46.335
It's soothing.

07:51.122 --> 07:55.213
I barely knew Holland,
but he seemed like...

07:56.258 --> 07:57.302
Good guy.

08:02.917 --> 08:04.571
I really liked him, Liz.

08:17.453 --> 08:18.759
[zipper opening]

08:23.154 --> 08:25.548
Susie, honey,
it's Dr. Edwards.

08:25.635 --> 08:27.245
Heard you had
a bad nightmare.

08:28.159 --> 08:29.813
It wasn't a nightmare.

08:31.032 --> 08:32.512
He was hurting himself.

08:34.035 --> 08:36.559
He doesn't understand
what's happening to him.

08:38.213 --> 08:40.215
I don't understand.
Who's being hurt?

08:41.521 --> 08:42.913
The man in the dark.

08:45.176 --> 08:46.961
He's so scared.

08:48.310 --> 08:50.747
I need to go to him.

08:50.834 --> 08:54.055
Okay, honey,
it was just a dream.

08:55.578 --> 08:57.232
You need to get
your rest now, okay?

09:03.760 --> 09:05.109
[zipper whirring]

09:11.812 --> 09:13.596
[branches scraping]

09:48.805 --> 09:49.589
Maria?

09:53.810 --> 09:54.681
Maria!

10:18.269 --> 10:19.183
Maria?

10:23.448 --> 10:24.275
Maria?

10:27.496 --> 10:29.193
When Shawna
was a little girl...

10:30.673 --> 10:32.632
Sometimes I would lay down
next to her

10:32.719 --> 10:34.459
just to listen to her breathe.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.252
Don't do this to yourself.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.212
You weren't around, Avery.

10:50.171 --> 10:51.476
You didn't know her like I did.

10:53.435 --> 10:54.697
[Avery sighs]

10:58.092 --> 10:59.833
I lost Shawna, too.

11:11.583 --> 11:12.976
[door closes]

11:25.293 --> 11:28.600
[cell phone buzzing]

11:34.432 --> 11:36.304
[screaming]

11:40.612 --> 11:41.483
Abby!

11:42.353 --> 11:43.572
[gasping]

11:45.356 --> 11:46.357
[cell phone buzzing]

11:47.097 --> 11:48.055
[sighs] Shit.

11:56.672 --> 11:58.282
Harlan.

11:58.369 --> 12:00.720
[Harlan]  Well, you sound
alert and rested.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.330
What's up? Any changes?

12:02.417 --> 12:04.636
Susie Coyle had an episode
during the night.

12:05.942 --> 12:07.204
Her heart rate and BP jumped,

12:07.291 --> 12:09.293
but we're on it.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.906
Okay, I know you, Harlan,

12:13.863 --> 12:15.386
drop the other shoe.

12:16.605 --> 12:19.086
We've got two new cases.

12:19.173 --> 12:21.088
They're on the same
drug regimen, but...

12:22.089 --> 12:23.743
So far, they're stable.

12:25.570 --> 12:27.529
Shit.

12:27.616 --> 12:29.139
This thing isn't stopping.

12:44.981 --> 12:46.504
Liz, I was thinking,

12:46.591 --> 12:49.333
-and I'm not sure--
-Wow. Help yourself.

12:49.420 --> 12:50.813
Oh.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.467
I'm sorry.

12:52.554 --> 12:55.209
You must be Abby. Margaux.

12:55.296 --> 12:56.776
-Hi.
-Morning.

12:56.863 --> 12:59.082
When I make the coffee,
it's nuclear strong.

12:59.169 --> 13:00.823
Liz spills some water
over a few beans

13:00.910 --> 13:02.303
and thinks she has
an espresso.

13:02.390 --> 13:03.783
You trashing me
to my friends?

13:04.958 --> 13:06.220
[chuckling]

13:08.352 --> 13:11.442
Now run before that shrimp boat
leaves without you.

13:11.529 --> 13:13.967
-Watch out. She's grumpy
in the morning.
-Mmm.

13:19.842 --> 13:22.584
What? It's not like you tell me
about your boyfriends.

13:26.457 --> 13:28.155
So, how'd you sleep?

13:28.242 --> 13:30.592
Do you think
Alec's boat blowing up
was an accident?

13:31.462 --> 13:32.855
Not well, then.

13:37.642 --> 13:38.643
Fine. [sighs]

13:39.644 --> 13:41.472
I don't like the timing.

13:41.559 --> 13:44.824
And I'm a cynical
and suspicious reporter.

13:44.911 --> 13:46.434
Yeah. Here's my problem.

13:48.653 --> 13:52.048
Alec wasn't just looking
into illegal dumping,

13:52.135 --> 13:55.835
he was tracking
the progress of the disease.

13:55.922 --> 13:58.141
And he thought that
he was onto something.

13:58.228 --> 14:01.362
And now he's gone,
and you can't ask him.

14:03.451 --> 14:04.844
Yeah.

14:04.931 --> 14:06.323
[Abby inhales sharply]

14:06.410 --> 14:10.197
Well, two new cases
came in today, so...

14:10.284 --> 14:12.764
Whatever we're doing,
it's not working.

14:12.852 --> 14:16.464
I think I need to
get into his lab
and look through his work.

14:16.551 --> 14:18.248
Except the cops
are all over it today.

14:19.684 --> 14:21.817
Police scanner, remember?

14:21.904 --> 14:24.385
Even Marais' finest
have protocol.

14:24.472 --> 14:27.649
It's standard in the case
of violent death.

14:27.736 --> 14:30.782
The man who hired Alec
could give me access.

14:30.870 --> 14:34.134
Are you seriously
talking about going to Avery?

14:34.221 --> 14:36.092
After what they did to you?

14:36.179 --> 14:39.443
Girl, do not let that man
mess with your mind.

14:39.530 --> 14:41.054
She does make good coffee.

14:41.141 --> 14:42.359
Don't change the subject.

14:42.446 --> 14:44.884
Avery Sunderland
is a master manipulator.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.842
Okay, you got hurt enough
the first time around.

14:49.018 --> 14:50.977
-I'm gonna be fine.
-Abby...

14:51.064 --> 14:52.152
[door opens]

14:52.239 --> 14:53.283
See you later.

14:54.937 --> 14:56.112
[door closes]

15:16.480 --> 15:17.873
[doorbell rings]

15:26.142 --> 15:27.100
Come in.

15:33.758 --> 15:34.759
Right this way.

16:09.229 --> 16:11.231
I don't think we've had
a fire in that thing

16:11.318 --> 16:13.363
since you and Shawna
used to open your
Christmas presents in here.

16:15.626 --> 16:18.107
A house without children
never loses the echoes,
you know.

16:22.590 --> 16:24.374
Look at you.
[laughing]

16:27.421 --> 16:29.466
I can't believe
it's been 14 years!

16:30.467 --> 16:31.512
[chuckles]

16:33.688 --> 16:36.473
-Hey, Abby.
-Hey.

16:36.560 --> 16:38.606
Come on, let's get you
something to drink.

16:38.693 --> 16:40.303
You want something to eat?
You hungry?

16:40.390 --> 16:42.784
No, I'm actually here
in my professional capacity.

16:44.612 --> 16:47.049
I know. With the CDC.

16:47.136 --> 16:53.099
Medical doctor,
infectious diseases,
specialist, that's impressive.

16:53.186 --> 16:54.578
From the time we took you in,

16:54.665 --> 16:56.102
eight-years-old
and bright as a whip,

16:56.189 --> 17:00.584
I knew that you would
do great things.

17:00.671 --> 17:03.892
-Avery--
-Hey, listen, before
we go any further,

17:03.979 --> 17:04.980
please just...

17:06.460 --> 17:08.766
Sit down for a minute,
Abby, please.

17:08.853 --> 17:10.377
I wanna talk to you.

17:11.943 --> 17:12.944
Okay.

17:18.602 --> 17:22.171
I owe you an apology.

17:23.912 --> 17:27.002
I never blamed you
for Shawna's death

17:27.089 --> 17:29.831
the way that Maria did,
and I should have
made that clear.

17:31.746 --> 17:35.228
And I wish to hell now
that I would have stepped up.

17:35.315 --> 17:37.752
You bore the full brunt
of her hostility,

17:37.839 --> 17:41.495
and I do not blame you
for getting out of Dodge.

17:41.582 --> 17:42.887
Well...

17:42.974 --> 17:45.977
I understood
that she was upset.

17:46.065 --> 17:49.198
[sighs] She was hanging
by a thread,

17:49.285 --> 17:52.332
and I couldn't bear
the thought
of fighting with her

17:52.419 --> 17:54.551
when the pain
was so fresh, but...

17:55.944 --> 17:57.902
I've had a long time
to think, Abby.

17:59.208 --> 18:01.428
You were a 17-year-old kid.

18:02.516 --> 18:03.691
I should've done better.

18:05.736 --> 18:07.260
Maybe if I had,
I wouldn't have...

18:08.696 --> 18:10.611
Wouldn't have lost
both my daughters, huh?

18:14.093 --> 18:15.224
[sniffles]

18:18.314 --> 18:19.620
Is Maria all right?

18:21.317 --> 18:22.623
We'll get through it.

18:24.929 --> 18:26.583
It's because of me.

18:26.670 --> 18:28.498
It's me coming back,
I stirred up all this emotion.

18:28.585 --> 18:29.543
I...

18:30.544 --> 18:31.545
I'm sorry.

18:35.462 --> 18:38.943
Why don't you
tell me what I can do
for the CDC, Abby?

18:40.510 --> 18:41.294
Well...

18:43.992 --> 18:47.648
You had an employee,
Alec Holland.

18:47.735 --> 18:49.867
Jesus. Yes, Alec.

18:49.954 --> 18:51.739
Sheriff just filled me
in this morning.

18:51.826 --> 18:54.089
I don't know what happened.
I still can't even believe it.

18:54.176 --> 18:57.310
Well, I believe that he had
some research that could
help us cure this disease.

18:57.919 --> 18:58.920
And...

19:00.139 --> 19:01.792
I need to get into his lab.

19:02.793 --> 19:03.881
I see.

19:05.013 --> 19:06.536
And I imagine you came to me

19:06.623 --> 19:09.713
because Lucilia's deputies
have got it locked down?

19:11.454 --> 19:12.716
Yes.

19:12.803 --> 19:14.457
[Avery] Hmm.

19:14.544 --> 19:17.721
But one call from you,
and that would all go away.

19:20.637 --> 19:23.597
That lab is full of
what my lawyers call...

19:25.164 --> 19:27.514
"Proprietary information."

19:27.601 --> 19:31.300
Okay. But people's lives
are at risk.

19:31.387 --> 19:33.302
Yes.

19:33.389 --> 19:36.000
And if I thought there was
anything in there

19:36.087 --> 19:37.698
that might help you,

19:37.785 --> 19:40.222
I'd be the first
to hand over the key.

19:40.309 --> 19:43.094
But I've invested
a small fortune
in that research,

19:43.182 --> 19:44.531
and once I open up
that barn door,

19:44.618 --> 19:46.272
there's no getting
the horses back inside.

19:46.359 --> 19:47.751
That data could
wind up anywhere.

19:49.753 --> 19:51.190
I could get a court order.

19:51.973 --> 19:53.714
If I have to.

19:53.801 --> 19:55.150
[Avery] Hmm.

19:55.237 --> 19:56.804
[chuckles] But,
of course, by then,

19:56.891 --> 19:59.415
all that proprietary
information might be gone.

20:00.416 --> 20:01.591
It might be.

20:05.247 --> 20:07.597
But here's what's
more important,

20:07.684 --> 20:11.862
regardless of what happens,
I'll still love you.

20:11.949 --> 20:14.387
And you will always
be welcome in this house.

20:20.480 --> 20:24.832
You know, you always
had a way of making
a "no" sound like a favor.

21:07.440 --> 21:08.397
You know why I'm here.

21:10.747 --> 21:12.836
Please.
I need your help.

21:14.534 --> 21:15.970
I thought I had it
under control.

21:17.928 --> 21:20.670
This pain, gnawing at me.

21:24.544 --> 21:28.069
But how can anyone forget
the loss of their only child?

21:28.156 --> 21:31.028
You don't, Maria.

21:31.115 --> 21:32.900
You find a way
to let it rest.

21:33.509 --> 21:34.902
I can't.

21:38.253 --> 21:39.080
It's like...

21:41.125 --> 21:42.823
I can hear her again.

21:44.912 --> 21:45.913
She's...

21:47.784 --> 21:49.003
She's calling out to me.

21:50.831 --> 21:51.832
Fine.

21:53.660 --> 21:54.617
Fine, sit.

22:10.764 --> 22:12.592
I want you to think
about Shawna.

22:15.986 --> 22:17.466
How you felt about her.

22:18.815 --> 22:20.469
How she died.

22:20.556 --> 22:21.775
And her spirit now.

22:25.996 --> 22:28.782
[speaking in Creole]

23:01.205 --> 23:02.381
Now...

23:08.343 --> 23:09.779
Show me.

23:10.867 --> 23:12.652
[Madame Xanadu gasping]

23:14.218 --> 23:15.306
Nimue...

23:17.308 --> 23:19.354
[screaming]

23:28.885 --> 23:29.930
[gasping]

23:30.017 --> 23:31.322
Maria?

23:31.410 --> 23:32.411
[retches]

23:32.976 --> 23:34.543
[panting]

23:34.630 --> 23:35.588
Maria?

23:38.286 --> 23:39.374
[sobs]

23:39.461 --> 23:41.507
What... What happened?

23:41.594 --> 23:46.207
There's been a shift
in the balance of the light
and the dark.

23:46.294 --> 23:48.427
-Is Shawna--
-Something's out there.

23:50.080 --> 23:52.343
I touched it.

23:52.431 --> 23:57.392
Something vast, dark,
and growing in the awful
and the rot of the water.

23:57.479 --> 23:59.612
If you trust me
like you say you do...

24:00.526 --> 24:01.788
You'll let this go.

24:05.008 --> 24:07.010
-I can't.
-Shawna's dead.

24:07.097 --> 24:09.012
No.

24:09.099 --> 24:10.100
[sobbing] No.

24:10.927 --> 24:12.059
Let her rest.

24:13.887 --> 24:15.192
Let her go.

24:19.153 --> 24:20.589
[alarms beeping]

24:30.643 --> 24:31.600
Oh, my God.

24:53.709 --> 24:55.276
This is where Alec was staying?

24:55.363 --> 24:57.539
Guess he didn't like
the Bide-A-Wee, either.

24:57.626 --> 25:00.063
Cassidy rents out rooms
in the back.

25:00.150 --> 25:02.588
Let's just hope Holland
brought work home with him.

25:02.675 --> 25:03.719
[bell ringing]

25:06.156 --> 25:07.767
-[man] Wait!
-Danny?

25:07.854 --> 25:09.420
Before I have to start
collecting social security.

25:09.508 --> 25:10.509
Hello?

25:11.640 --> 25:12.989
[music playing over speakers]

25:13.076 --> 25:14.469
Hello?

25:16.079 --> 25:17.864
Oh. Hi, ladies.

25:17.951 --> 25:19.692
Everything okay?

25:19.779 --> 25:21.694
Yeah. I'm sorry, I was just
rehearsing for an audition.

25:23.086 --> 25:24.610
You're an actor?

25:24.697 --> 25:26.437
Well, yeah.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.875
83% on Rotten Tomatoes.

25:28.962 --> 25:30.398
They like that
I do my own stunts.

25:30.485 --> 25:33.227
Abby, this is Daniel Cassidy.

25:33.314 --> 25:34.837
Owner and operator,

25:34.924 --> 25:37.623
not to mention,
Marais' resident movie star.

25:37.710 --> 25:40.539
Thanks. This place is just
a little side dish for me.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.324
I'm impressed.

25:43.411 --> 25:45.979
Well, in that case,
I have a movie poster for you.

25:46.066 --> 25:47.937
I'd be happy to sign it.

25:48.024 --> 25:50.549
Danny, my friend
works for the CDC...

25:50.636 --> 25:52.638
Dr. Abby Arcane.

25:52.725 --> 25:54.204
We're here about Alec Holland.

25:54.291 --> 25:55.336
Oh.

25:56.772 --> 25:58.644
So sad to hear
about that guy.

25:58.731 --> 26:02.038
Yeah, I was hoping
I could take a look
inside of his room.

26:02.125 --> 26:04.606
Well, yeah, sure,
but you're not gonna
find anything.

26:04.693 --> 26:06.869
-Why?
-The cops were here
an hour ago.

26:06.956 --> 26:08.218
In and out in 20 minutes.

26:08.305 --> 26:10.873
Did he have a computer?
Anything?

26:10.960 --> 26:13.310
Yeah, he did, but they
took it back from him
when he got fired.

26:13.397 --> 26:15.530
Couldn't afford his own.

26:15.617 --> 26:17.619
Well, hell, half the time
he would use mine

26:17.706 --> 26:20.753
to edit his journal entries
before he would upload them.

26:20.840 --> 26:22.363
He had a work journal?

26:22.450 --> 26:24.539
No, not work.
Well, it may be work.

26:24.626 --> 26:27.455
Mostly just mud-whomping-
in-the-swamp kinda stuff.

26:27.542 --> 26:30.110
He was the kinda guy
that dug plants
and birds and shit.

26:33.113 --> 26:35.028
Garou, hi!

26:35.115 --> 26:36.856
Yeah, the cops
dropped him off here.

26:36.943 --> 26:38.466
They didn't know
what else to do with him.

26:40.207 --> 26:42.557
I'm sorry, buddy.
He's not coming back.

26:44.864 --> 26:47.083
Is there a place
I could take a look at this?

26:47.170 --> 26:49.042
Yeah, sure.

26:49.129 --> 26:52.045
You know what?
Come grab a seat upstairs.
I'mma show ya.

26:52.132 --> 26:54.351
So, Danny, what happened
to you on Sunday?

26:54.438 --> 26:56.136
We missed you
at Roadhouse Jam.

26:57.659 --> 26:58.617
Help yourself.

27:00.053 --> 27:01.750
Never mind what
happened on Sunday.

27:01.837 --> 27:04.100
It's next Sunday
that you need to get
excited about.

27:04.187 --> 27:05.885
-Oh, yeah?
-I am mixing tracks together

27:05.972 --> 27:08.539
that no one has ever
even conceived of.

27:08.627 --> 27:12.282
Throw in cayenne cajun sauce,
mixing all that up too.

27:25.992 --> 27:29.082
Well, I got a very
exciting entry today.
I just got fired.

27:30.605 --> 27:32.868
So that's awesome. Uh...

27:32.955 --> 27:34.870
So why am I still
in the middle of the swamp?

27:34.957 --> 27:37.220
Uh, masochist, maybe.

27:37.307 --> 27:40.876
Or because I know
I'm on to something.

27:40.963 --> 27:43.226
I know it. I just...

27:43.313 --> 27:47.361
need some time
to prove it is all,
and hopefully soon.

27:47.448 --> 27:50.364
Because there's nothing
I hate more than being fired,

27:51.278 --> 27:52.279
than being poor.

27:54.934 --> 27:56.022
And I need new sandals.

27:59.329 --> 28:01.854
All right, bad news first is

28:01.941 --> 28:04.334
we now know that somebody
has been dumping accelerant
out in the swamp.

28:04.421 --> 28:07.598
Why is still a fucking
mystery to us,
but, uh, good news is,

28:07.686 --> 28:10.950
is we think that if
we, uh, find and collect
all these boxes,

28:11.037 --> 28:14.083
we may be able to, uh,
stop this thing, so...

28:14.170 --> 28:15.258
We, um...

28:16.129 --> 28:18.000
[scoffs]

28:18.087 --> 28:19.654
"We," right?
Jesus, it's been
a long day.

28:19.741 --> 28:21.874
Um...

28:21.961 --> 28:24.920
Yeah, I've been working
with a, uh, doctor from
the CDC today,

28:25.007 --> 28:27.706
Abby Arcane. She's, um...

28:27.793 --> 28:30.665
She's very smart, very smart.
Very driven, and, uh...

28:33.146 --> 28:34.930
Well, she googled me, so.

28:39.674 --> 28:40.719
She's quite lovely.

28:44.505 --> 28:48.030
Oh, here we go, here we go.
Got something,
got something... All right.

28:48.117 --> 28:49.684
-[footsteps approaching]
-[Liz] Abby?

28:49.771 --> 28:51.294
[sniffles]

28:51.381 --> 28:54.080
-You good?
-Yeah. [clears throat]

28:54.167 --> 28:55.472
[cell phone buzzing]

29:00.390 --> 29:01.478
Shit.

29:02.697 --> 29:04.699
-Susie.
-Is she all right?

29:04.786 --> 29:05.787
She's missing.

29:10.574 --> 29:13.752
[Jason] Have you heard anything
more about who's taking
my students?

29:13.839 --> 29:17.712
[Caroline] Yes, Professor
Zimmerman has agreed to cover
your classes until we get back.

29:17.799 --> 29:23.022
[Jason] Zimmerman?
The man is mediocrity
wrapped in ignorance.

29:23.109 --> 29:26.068
You're not gonna do that
when we meet Avery
Sunderland, right?

29:26.155 --> 29:27.243
No, of course not.

29:29.593 --> 29:33.380
Because he does not need
to be told he's a dead weight
on your creativity

29:33.467 --> 29:35.382
and only useful
for his money.

29:35.469 --> 29:37.950
Or whatever opinion
you happen to form
on the spot

29:38.037 --> 29:39.647
-and need to share.
-Uh-huh, yeah.

29:39.734 --> 29:40.909
-Truth saves time.
-[door opens]

29:43.607 --> 29:46.175
-He sent you those mutagens
that you love.
-I know.

29:46.262 --> 29:47.916
And he's paid a lot
of money for you
to develop the accelerant.

29:48.003 --> 29:50.440
Yes. And then he interrupted
my work by telling me,

29:50.527 --> 29:52.834
"Hey, get your ass down here,
there's an emergency."

29:54.575 --> 29:57.099
I can't wait to see
what this disease of his is.

29:57.186 --> 29:59.972
You know, probably someone
dispersing the accelerant
caught a cold.

30:00.842 --> 30:03.584
Hey! We're the Woodrues.

30:03.671 --> 30:05.151
We're here to see Mr...

30:05.238 --> 30:07.109
Yes, Mr. Sunderland
told me to expect you.

30:07.196 --> 30:08.894
If you could go around
to the marsh side.

30:08.981 --> 30:09.982
He's working on his swing.

30:12.027 --> 30:12.811
His swing?

30:16.336 --> 30:17.946
[water splashes]

30:18.033 --> 30:19.905
[Jason] I'm not going to.

30:19.992 --> 30:21.254
[Caroline] I'm just saying that
there's no point in offending

30:21.341 --> 30:22.995
the man who's funding
your research.

30:23.082 --> 30:25.475
[Jason] I have no intention
of offending him, okay?

30:25.562 --> 30:27.477
Even if he ends up being
an entitled idiot,

30:27.564 --> 30:28.870
like Zimmerman.

30:33.005 --> 30:35.137
-[Avery] Over here!
-[Jason] Oh.

30:35.224 --> 30:36.225
We're being summoned.

30:40.012 --> 30:41.578
-Jason.
-Look at that tree.

30:41.665 --> 30:42.928
Jason, keep walking.

30:43.015 --> 30:44.190
-Jason.
-No...

30:47.497 --> 30:48.542
Oh.

30:50.239 --> 30:51.806
-Hi.
-Hi.

30:53.503 --> 30:55.375
-How are you?
-Good.

30:55.462 --> 30:56.463
Are you the gardener?

30:58.378 --> 31:01.729
This is a Japanese elm,

31:01.816 --> 31:03.774
and it's in transplant shock.

31:03.862 --> 31:04.993
Go up to the kitchen,

31:05.080 --> 31:06.908
get a pan of water and sugar.

31:06.995 --> 31:09.128
And then you're gonna treat
the roots right here like this.

31:09.215 --> 31:10.825
Okay? You got that?

31:10.912 --> 31:12.000
-Yes, sir.
-Go.

31:12.087 --> 31:13.175
What is he doing?

31:13.262 --> 31:14.394
Um...

31:14.481 --> 31:17.136
-Admiring your trees.
-Mmm.

31:17.223 --> 31:18.398
He likes trees?

31:20.530 --> 31:22.706
Dr. Jason Woodrue.

31:22.793 --> 31:25.448
Thank you
for asking us here.

31:25.535 --> 31:26.885
It's very beautiful.

31:26.972 --> 31:28.451
Yes, we're very proud of it.

31:28.538 --> 31:30.801
900 acres.

31:30.889 --> 31:33.065
I know my staff
would be happy
to show you

31:33.152 --> 31:34.805
more of the gardens,
Mrs. Woodrue.

31:34.893 --> 31:37.504
Yeah, she's also
Dr. Woodrue, so, um...

31:38.418 --> 31:39.462
She stays.

31:41.029 --> 31:41.987
That's fine.

31:44.511 --> 31:47.383
So what the fuck, Jason?

31:49.124 --> 31:50.909
I beg your pardon?

31:50.996 --> 31:54.521
You told me your accelerant
would make things grow faster.

31:54.608 --> 31:56.175
More trees
to drain the water,

31:56.262 --> 31:57.524
more land to develop,

31:57.611 --> 31:59.961
more plants
to develop into drugs

32:00.048 --> 32:04.226
and cosmetics
and things to monetize.

32:04.313 --> 32:05.793
The accelerant works.

32:05.880 --> 32:07.229
Oh, it works!

32:07.316 --> 32:09.188
Like a son of a bitch.

32:09.275 --> 32:12.017
But we've also got
a hospital full up
with people

32:12.104 --> 32:16.021
with some kind of
crazy green flu.

32:16.108 --> 32:20.460
There's no way that
my accelerant was
responsible for that.

32:20.547 --> 32:22.331
The accelerant dumped
in the water,
and people getting sick?

32:22.418 --> 32:24.333
Don't talk down
to me, Mr. Doctor.

32:24.420 --> 32:27.380
Diseases emerge from swamps
all of the time.

32:27.467 --> 32:28.729
Uh...

32:28.816 --> 32:30.731
Dengue fever, ebola, malaria.

32:31.688 --> 32:33.386
Living on a swamp

32:33.473 --> 32:35.779
is like living next to
a gloriously diverse cesspool.

32:39.914 --> 32:43.396
But I'm gonna...
I'm gonna look into it.

32:43.483 --> 32:46.181
No, you're gonna fix it.

32:46.268 --> 32:48.227
Because the CDC's in town,
telling people

32:48.314 --> 32:51.447
that this disease is
like nothing they've
ever seen before.

32:51.534 --> 32:53.841
Now I'm taking care
of things on my end.

32:53.928 --> 32:57.366
But if my name gets linked
with this accelerant mess,

32:57.453 --> 32:59.455
there's gonna be lawsuits,

32:59.542 --> 33:01.501
there's gonna be arrests.

33:01.588 --> 33:03.851
Things are going to happen
to nice people,

33:03.938 --> 33:07.115
like you've never
even dreamed of.

33:07.202 --> 33:09.465
And I'm gonna make sure
that they happen

33:09.552 --> 33:12.207
to all three of us, doctors.

33:16.429 --> 33:17.778
So how did she go missing?

33:17.865 --> 33:19.214
She got out her window.

33:19.301 --> 33:20.999
But I don't know
how she managed it.

33:21.086 --> 33:23.044
Is she contagious?

33:23.131 --> 33:25.351
We have to assume it.

33:25.438 --> 33:27.962
We also have to assume
that her condition is going
to worsen, and fast.

33:28.049 --> 33:30.878
Meanwhile, we've got
another half-hour of daylight.

33:30.965 --> 33:32.532
-If that.
-[cell phone buzzing]

33:33.968 --> 33:34.838
Cable.

33:37.972 --> 33:39.017
Right, we're on it.

33:41.062 --> 33:42.498
Found something down
at the South docks.

33:45.849 --> 33:48.156
-[Abby] Dr. Arcane.
-[man] Conyer.

33:48.243 --> 33:50.115
I think a sick kid was here.

33:50.202 --> 33:53.335
Found it on the railing.
She must have ripped it
on a nail.

34:01.126 --> 34:02.301
Who docks here?

34:02.388 --> 34:03.693
The Game Warden, mostly.

34:03.780 --> 34:05.521
Vern Robitelle.

34:05.608 --> 34:07.915
He took a boat out
just a few minutes ago.

34:08.002 --> 34:09.960
You know where he's headed?

34:10.048 --> 34:11.397
Said something
about Skeeter Cove.

34:13.355 --> 34:15.444
[Abby] Skeeter Cove?

34:15.531 --> 34:17.316
That's where we found
Susie's father's boat.

34:19.361 --> 34:20.623
She's gone into the swamp.

34:28.457 --> 34:30.111
[indistinct radio chatter]

34:41.427 --> 34:44.778
[dispatcher]  All officers,
Susie Coyle's gone missing
from Marais General.

34:44.865 --> 34:46.345
She's nine-years-old--

34:46.432 --> 34:47.433
[radio clicks off]

35:10.456 --> 35:12.632
Robitelle, game 6.

35:12.719 --> 35:16.810
Base, I'm seeing some,
uh, lights on the water
off the cove out here.

35:16.897 --> 35:18.812
[dispatcher]  Copy that, Robi.
You want backup?

35:18.899 --> 35:21.467
Nah, it's probably
just some old boys
over the limit on gator.

35:23.556 --> 35:24.992
I'm gonna get closer,
see what I can see.

35:25.079 --> 35:26.080
[dispatcher]  Copy that.

35:48.711 --> 35:50.583
What are you doing?

36:07.991 --> 36:09.167
[siren whoops]

36:12.387 --> 36:15.173
[over megaphone]  Game Warden.  You on the boat, pencils down.

36:15.260 --> 36:16.174
Right now.

36:17.610 --> 36:18.828
Hey, Robi, is that you?

36:19.873 --> 36:22.223
Oh, shit, Landreaux. Again?

36:22.310 --> 36:23.877
[chuckles] Yeah.

36:23.964 --> 36:25.922
Hey, I swear to God,
we're just about to head in.

36:26.009 --> 36:27.837
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I know, I know.

36:27.924 --> 36:29.709
And you know more than most
I gotta check you out, brother.

36:29.796 --> 36:31.101
Come on.

36:31.189 --> 36:33.060
-Be cool.
-[man] Shit.

36:34.409 --> 36:35.802
[indistinct radio chatter]

36:39.849 --> 36:41.373
Ooh.

36:41.460 --> 36:42.417
Well, shit.

36:46.378 --> 36:47.335
What's in the box?

36:50.860 --> 36:52.775
Come on, Landreaux,
I wanna make this
as quick and as painless...

36:52.862 --> 36:53.820
[groans]

37:00.130 --> 37:01.523
[Landreaux] Fuck!
What are you doing, man?

37:01.610 --> 37:03.003
This is Robi!
What are you doing?

37:08.661 --> 37:10.010
What'd you do, man?

37:10.097 --> 37:11.751
Piece of shit
should have backed off.

37:11.838 --> 37:13.318
This is bad, man.
This is fucking bad,
all right?

37:13.405 --> 37:14.667
Yeah?

37:14.754 --> 37:16.234
Your law get their hands
on them boxes,

37:16.321 --> 37:17.800
that old man gonna kill us!

37:17.887 --> 37:19.628
-[sputtering]
-[Landreaux] What the fuck?

37:20.586 --> 37:22.283
What are we gonna do now?

37:22.370 --> 37:24.677
[man] Shut up!
Let me think.

37:29.159 --> 37:32.424
You haul ass and pull up
the rest of them boxes!

37:32.511 --> 37:35.165
I'm gonna sink this tub
and deal with this cop.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.124
You pick me up
when you're done.

37:37.211 --> 37:38.386
-Hey, boss said...
-What?

37:39.344 --> 37:41.128
You got any better ideas?

37:44.000 --> 37:45.175
Go!

37:45.959 --> 37:47.047
Now.

38:04.412 --> 38:06.980
[Lucilia] We need eyes
on the water ASAP.

38:07.067 --> 38:09.069
We have reason to believe
that Susie Coyle may have
snuck aboard

38:09.156 --> 38:11.593
-Game Warden Robitelle's boat.
-[officer]  Copy that, Sheriff.

38:11.680 --> 38:13.334
You're going
out there with her?

38:14.466 --> 38:16.685
[Matt] What, is that a problem?

38:16.772 --> 38:19.471
Of course you were
the first person she called.

38:19.558 --> 38:20.994
Well, that's 'cause
she trusts me.

38:22.735 --> 38:23.866
Do you trust yourself?

38:27.827 --> 38:29.611
Look, when this
whole flu thing is over,

38:29.698 --> 38:31.744
she's gonna go back
to whatever it is
she calls home.

38:31.831 --> 38:33.136
-You know that.
-Look, I'm well aware

38:33.223 --> 38:35.051
that she's got
a life in Atlanta.

38:35.138 --> 38:37.140
Look, I don't know
what she's got going on
up in Atlanta,

38:37.227 --> 38:40.448
but I do know that you
have been nursing this flame
for a long time.

38:40.535 --> 38:41.667
Shh... Come on, Ma.

38:41.754 --> 38:43.146
When you care,
you care hard.

38:43.233 --> 38:44.974
There's nothing easy
about you, Mattie.

38:45.061 --> 38:46.933
You would cut off
your right arm
for the person you love.

38:47.020 --> 38:49.718
And I'm just saying,
and this is your mama talking,

38:49.805 --> 38:53.287
that with this one there,
that is a recipe for disaster.

38:57.639 --> 38:58.510
Matt?

39:07.693 --> 39:09.216
Just watch yourself
out there.

39:20.488 --> 39:21.837
[indistinct radio chatter]

39:32.500 --> 39:34.676
I'm surprised
you came back.

39:34.763 --> 39:36.896
Well, the CDC was involved
in that decision.

39:38.332 --> 39:39.377
Yeah, really?
How much?

39:40.116 --> 39:41.117
What do you mean?

39:42.902 --> 39:45.339
There's something
about this place,
I don't know.

39:45.426 --> 39:48.560
Trying to escape
the gravitational pull,
people get drawn back in.

39:49.996 --> 39:52.259
I thought you
made it out, though.

39:52.346 --> 39:53.826
I'm only passing through.

39:53.913 --> 39:55.871
[sighs]

39:55.958 --> 39:57.960
I wanted to see
how things were
with the people I left.

39:59.222 --> 40:01.790
Mmm-hmm. Sunderlands.

40:01.877 --> 40:05.925
Gotta admit, it's a pretty
gutsy choice coming back
to face them.

40:06.012 --> 40:08.580
Then again,
you were always the first one
off the high dive in gym.

40:10.103 --> 40:11.713
That's probably
why I had a crush on you.

40:14.673 --> 40:16.109
Come on, doesn't
a girl always know?

40:16.675 --> 40:17.806
Uh...

40:17.893 --> 40:20.548
I... I had no idea.

40:20.635 --> 40:23.986
Yeah, it's why
I was staring at you
all through prom.

40:24.073 --> 40:26.467
I was just trying
to get up the nerve
to ask you to dance.

41:22.218 --> 41:24.786
[dispatcher]  Robi, we just
got a call from the sheriff.
Watch your 20.

41:29.878 --> 41:31.445
[Susie panting in distance]

41:44.980 --> 41:47.287
The last fucking thing
I need right now.

41:52.379 --> 41:54.599
[in distance] Where are you?

41:54.686 --> 41:56.078
You wanna play
hide-and-seek?

42:03.912 --> 42:05.740
You think I'm playing
some kind of game?

42:42.037 --> 42:44.213
Matt.

42:44.300 --> 42:46.215
-Yup, I see it.
-[siren chirps]

42:52.831 --> 42:54.789
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

42:54.876 --> 42:55.834
Abby, be careful.

42:57.183 --> 42:58.619
-Matt!
-Shit.

43:05.278 --> 43:06.975
[both gasp]

43:07.062 --> 43:08.063
Fuck.

43:08.150 --> 43:10.413
[wheezing]

43:10.500 --> 43:11.937
Oh, my God,
Susie's been here.

43:12.024 --> 43:13.155
[motor whirring]

43:14.896 --> 43:16.985
I got a boat out here.

43:17.072 --> 43:20.772
Fuck. Go, go.
It's okay, I'll stay here.

43:20.859 --> 43:22.121
-Go.
-Are you sure?

43:22.208 --> 43:23.905
Yeah, she could be
on that boat, Matt.

43:23.992 --> 43:25.341
Go! Give me that bag.

43:27.909 --> 43:28.910
Stay in contact.

43:53.761 --> 43:55.023
Stay with me.
Stay with me.

43:57.286 --> 43:58.418
Fuck!

44:00.594 --> 44:01.813
I'm so sorry.

Susie!

44:20.875 --> 44:22.355
Matt, Susie's here.

44:22.442 --> 44:23.965
She's in trouble.
Please come back.

44:24.052 --> 44:25.053
Shit!

44:26.707 --> 44:27.708
Susie!

44:49.382 --> 44:50.470
[Susie screams]

45:05.180 --> 45:06.616
Come, little fucker.

45:09.663 --> 45:11.012
You don't wanna run from me.

are you?

Oh, my God. Susie!

Susie. Are you okay?

47:43.121 --> 47:44.296
Oh, my God.

47:52.434 --> 47:55.742
Susie, I need you to come...
I need you to come down here.

47:55.829 --> 47:56.830
I need you to walk
to me, Susie.

47:57.657 --> 47:58.745
It's okay.

47:59.311 --> 48:00.312
Now!

48:04.142 --> 48:05.360
Come here.
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

48:25.467 --> 48:26.555
[siren chirps]

-Matt!
-[Matt] Abby!

Maria?

49:00.372 --> 49:01.416
Damn it.

49:51.901 --> 49:54.513
[dispatcher]  Cable,
what's your status?

49:54.600 --> 49:56.819
Recovered the Coyle girl,
ETA 20 minutes.

49:59.561 --> 50:00.519
Susie.

50:03.174 --> 50:04.697
That creature we just saw...

50:07.613 --> 50:10.094
He's afraid.

50:10.181 --> 50:12.879
He told me he doesn't know
what's happening to him.

50:16.056 --> 50:17.405
It spoke to you?

50:27.154 --> 50:29.374
Can you remember
anything else he said?

50:32.638 --> 50:33.639
Yes.

50:35.510 --> 50:38.731
He said his name was Alec.

50:50.438 --> 50:52.397
[theme music playing]
