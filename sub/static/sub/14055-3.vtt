00:02.919 --> 00:04.421
Caleb is going to be indicted.
I don't know when.

00:04.629 --> 00:07.090
-Oh, my God, the yard guy?
-Yeah, I know.

00:07.257 --> 00:11.094
What was I supposed to do, wait for you?
You weren't coming back.

00:11.219 --> 00:12.261
I wanted you to tell me the truth.

00:12.303 --> 00:13.596
-Who's your favorite writer?
-Bendis.

00:13.638 --> 00:14.847
Well, hot damn, welcome to the club.

00:15.389 --> 00:17.641
-I love that guy.
-You're not the only one.

00:17.766 --> 00:20.811
-You had me three months ago, and you left.
-I want to make that up to you.

00:20.852 --> 00:25.357
This has nothing to do with me.
It is about you, and it is always about you.

00:25.482 --> 00:29.485
-Put your hands behind your head.
-Don't say anything.
I'll follow you to the station.

00:36.677 --> 00:38.846
Do you think I did the right thing--
cutting my hair?

00:39.472 --> 00:41.640
I can't believe this about your grandfather.
He's in big trouble.

00:41.807 --> 00:43.976
Yeah, I know, with the creek and the no paddle.

00:44.184 --> 00:47.729
Damn Oregonian barbers, man,
making my head too small for my body.

00:47.771 --> 00:50.357
-How do you work with this mirror?
-Grandpa, front page, jail?

00:50.607 --> 00:54.736
-I was in that photo. I got cut out, though,
...probably 'cause of my hairdo.
-Sorry to see you're so upset.

00:55.528 --> 01:00.491
-I'll survive. It'll grow out.
-I'm talking about Caleb.Looks like someone
was way off base.

01:02.451 --> 01:04.495
Accusing you of making everything about you.

01:07.456 --> 01:09.791
-My God, she is right.
-I was just kidding, man.

01:10.041 --> 01:13.795
No, dude, here I am, going on and on about my haircut.
My grandfather's in the cooler.

01:14.504 --> 01:17.673
I'm like a monster, dude.
I'm all I think about, and not in a good way.

01:17.840 --> 01:21.802
-There's a good way?
-Talk to me about anything other than me.
Go, give me anything.

01:21.927 --> 01:24.972
-Ah, here it is. First day of A.P. Physics today.
I'm kind of nervous.

01:25.138 --> 01:28.100
Ryan, could you quit fretting
over your nerd gear for like five seconds?

01:28.141 --> 01:33.271
We have a real crisis on our hands,
unless Summer's wrong, and I'm not completely
insufferable.

01:35.023 --> 01:40.069
-Why didn't you just tell me, then?
-It was kind of hard getting a word in.
I mean, you're a good talker,
but you're not so

01:40.277 --> 01:43.697
Summer's right then.
I have to do, I have to change.
I have to be a better person.

01:43.989 --> 01:44.656
Better how?

01:44.907 --> 01:47.451
Uh, less selfish. More selfless,
less take, more give.

01:47.868 --> 01:50.704
-Less pitching, more catching.
-Look, man, I'm used to it.
You don't have to change for me.

01:50.954 --> 01:52.622
-Oh, I'm not changing for you.
-For who then, Summer?

01:52.789 --> 01:56.167
Uh, no, no, uh, uh,
I-I think for the greater good of man.

01:56.292 --> 01:59.170
There's no hidden agenda here,
like say, getting Summer back?

01:59.337 --> 02:02.423
Dude, I don't even want Summer back.
Unless...

02:02.798 --> 02:05.467
that is what she wants, in which case,
that's not about me.

02:05.592 --> 02:10.305
That's about... me supporting her,
and her wanting of, of, of me...

02:10.430 --> 02:11.931
But I think that's
what she wants, okay?

02:12.140 --> 02:14.142
Just admit it-- you want her back.
No. No, I don't.

02:14.350 --> 02:20.189
-It's the new me, Ryan.
World, wrap your head around the new Seth Cohen.
-You're talking about yourself in the third person

02:21.106 --> 02:22.441
How is Seth's hair right now?

Profitez de la vie!

02:55.179 --> 03:00.142
-Oh, you can thank me later.
-Thank you...for letting me sleep
the night in jail.

03:00.392 --> 03:03.896
It was the most vile, most inhuman night of my life.

03:04.104 --> 03:07.607
Well, coming from the guy who married
Julie Cooper, that's saying something.

03:07.733 --> 03:12.654
So, aside from coming up with your hilarious one-liners,
what's our next move?

03:12.779 --> 03:17.366
My next move is to meet with the partners.
Make sure they agree to my taking you on as a client.

03:17.617 --> 03:21.370
-Why wouldn't they?
-You're not exactly the ideal client.

03:21.495 --> 03:25.582
-What-- rich, powerful?
-Guilty.

03:28.168 --> 03:32.338
-You missed the turn.
-I'm not taking you to the office.
Kirsten is meeting us at the house.

03:32.547 --> 03:34.424
-I have a business to run.
-Who are you kidding?

03:35.133 --> 03:39.303
We both know, with the exception
of the underhanded stuff, Kirsten does everything anyway.

03:39.929 --> 03:43.557
Step down.Put Kirsten in charge.
That's your next move.

04:05.202 --> 04:05.994
Excuse me.

04:07.120 --> 04:14.252
-I'm new, um... is it all right to park here?
-Sure, if you're not embarrassed.

04:26.054 --> 04:27.848
-Ryan, what would you like?
-You buying?

04:28.056 --> 04:31.976
No, but I'm letting you order first.
I may be selfless, but I'm still pretty stingy.

04:32.268 --> 04:38.774
-Well, in that case,uh, let's see.
Can I have a...what, what do you got?
-Large coffee.

04:40.401 --> 04:42.569
I just didn't want to keep him waiting.
That'd be selfish.

04:43.487 --> 04:45.197
Iced coffee for me,please.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.535
What? There's a new club at the pier
that the Walkmen are playing at.

04:50.577 --> 04:53.329
-You know who loves the Walkmen?
-You?
-Yeah, and...

04:53.538 --> 04:56.707
-Summer.
-Summer is going out with Zach?

04:56.749 --> 04:59.126
Yeah, so maybe I'll buy her and
Zach tickets to the show.

04:59.251 --> 05:02.171
-Why would you do that?
-Out of friendship and to show her
how selfless I can be.

05:02.296 --> 05:07.300
-And to get her back.
-I'm going to look into this.
-Seth, your coffee.
-Oh, thanks a lot.I'll, uh, get you next time.

05:09.553 --> 05:13.806
-Oh, my God. I am so sorry.
-That was refreshing.

05:14.098 --> 05:15.224
Uh, here, let me...

05:16.767 --> 05:19.854
-I... am so sorry.
Are you okay?

05:19.979 --> 05:24.900
-Yeah, I have to, uh, get a rhinoplasty,
but now I'll look just like all the other
girls here.

05:25.025 --> 05:29.571
It's okay, really.
Uh, you can leave my tampons where they are.
Thanks.

05:31.531 --> 05:33.158
Is there anything I can do?

05:33.324 --> 05:37.495
Uh, well, I guess you could dislocate my shoulder,
or shave off my eyebrows.

05:37.745 --> 05:41.040
I mean, is this how you guys treat
all your new students,or is today just my lucky day?

05:41.207 --> 05:44.501
-Can I buy you a coffee?
-No, no, no, no.
Please, please don't.

05:44.626 --> 05:47.838
I've had plenty, thanks,
and I'm guessing you have, too.

05:48.004 --> 05:55.636
I'm just going to ring out my shirt
and stuff toilet paper up my nose,
and I'm sure I'll have no trouble fitting in now.

05:55.845 --> 05:57.346
So, thanks.

06:00.182 --> 06:03.727
Dad, we have to think about the future here.

06:03.769 --> 06:08.356
The only way a company is going to survive a crisis like this
is for the C.E.O. to step down.

06:08.940 --> 06:12.152
Face it, Caleb, it's time
to get your Martha Stewart on.

06:14.570 --> 06:19.116
There's more police, more reporters,
or angry stockholders.

06:20.993 --> 06:22.494
Julie, hi.

06:23.078 --> 06:29.626
Caleb. As soon as I saw the paper,
I walked right out of my seaweed wrap,
and I came right here.

06:29.668 --> 06:35.256
-That's a heartwarming tale.
-A relaxing weekend at the Montage
was exactly what I needed to remind me
of what's important

06:35.840 --> 06:40.386
I know I haven't been there for you, sweetie.
But you haven't been exactly honest with me.

06:40.594 --> 06:44.598
-Uh, we're going to..
-It was just getting good.

06:45.182 --> 06:46.475
All right.

06:49.186 --> 06:54.107
Honey...When Jimmy went down,
our marriage fell apart.

06:54.148 --> 06:59.278
I do not want that to happen to us.
We're partners, which means we share everything.

06:59.320 --> 07:03.824
So, put me to work. What can I do--
talk to the press, make some calls?

07:03.907 --> 07:06.451
-Kirsten is taking care of all of that.
-Well, she can't do everything.

07:06.618 --> 07:09.829
-Surely there's something I can do.
-There is one thing, but...

07:09.871 --> 07:11.581
-Name it.
-Food.

07:12.290 --> 07:17.795
-Since I'm going to be working from home,
we're going to need some water, some coffee,
some of those pumpkin muffins I like

07:18.045 --> 07:19.338
Thanks, JuJu.

07:20.172 --> 07:22.591
Kirsten, Sandy?
Back to business.

07:28.972 --> 07:31.224
Is it just me, or is Zach perfect?

07:31.391 --> 07:37.688
He's good-looking, but not into himself,
smart, but not a showoff.
Athletic, but sensitive.

07:37.939 --> 07:41.275
A politician's son.
Hey, he's like Newport's Prince William.

07:41.400 --> 07:48.448
-Yeah, the kind of guy parents love.
-Hey, did I tell you how stoked my dad is
that I'm dating a congressman's son?

07:48.490 --> 07:51.284
-He is, like, dying to go have lunch with Zach.
-So, you going to do it?

07:51.451 --> 07:54.579
No way. Remember what a Grade A disaster
that was with Cohen?

07:54.746 --> 07:57.707
-Yeah, but Zach's not Seth.
-Believe me, I know.

07:58.624 --> 08:01.126
-So, then what's the problem?
You afraid he might actually like Zach?

08:01.377 --> 08:05.380
Then you two will live happily ever after
with no problems and nothing standing in your way?

08:05.547 --> 08:09.176
-No. I... no.
-Oh, so, then you're not over Seth.

08:09.301 --> 08:15.056
Oh, I am. I've divested myself
of all of Seth's material possessions.
I'm vibrating at an extremely Cohenless frequency.

08:15.139 --> 08:20.102
-Okay, so, then you don't really like Zach.
-No. I mean yes. I don't... Ew, shut up.

08:20.227 --> 08:21.604
Hey, Summer. Marissa.

08:23.022 --> 08:24.898
Hey. Come sit down.

08:27.192 --> 08:30.403
Oh, hey, Marissa, I was really sorry
to read about your stepdad in the paper today.

08:30.654 --> 08:38.202
-You read the paper?
-Just the L.A. Times, the New York Times,
the Orange County Register and The Wall Street Journal.

08:40.955 --> 08:45.584
This relationship is probably over now, right?
I'll just go.

08:46.043 --> 08:51.381
No, no, no. Stay. Um, actually,
we were just talking, and um...

08:51.798 --> 08:54.592
What are you doing this weekend?

09:08.730 --> 09:09.648
You got to be kidding me.

09:09.689 --> 09:12.650
I know, I know. I'm sorry,
but it's the only seat left.

09:13.151 --> 09:17.280
-Don't worry, I promise I'll keep my hands to myself.
-Well, it's your elbow I'm worried about.

09:23.285 --> 09:26.246
-Why do you hate me so much?
-No, I don't; I'm sorry.

09:26.371 --> 09:28.623
-What did I do?
-It was an accident.
-No, it was like four accidents.

09:28.957 --> 09:32.502
-Six, if you count each individual tampon.
-I don't know what else you want me to say.

09:32.627 --> 09:37.298
-Nothing. In fact, we never need to speak to each other again.
-Yeah, see, but I was really enjoying getting to know you.

09:37.423 --> 09:39.717
-Well, I wasn't.
-I was being sarcastic.
-I wasn't.

09:40.134 --> 09:40.676
Morning, guys.

09:41.427 --> 09:46.139
Your favorite physics teacher here, R.E. Greenberg,
with your new lab partner assignments.

09:46.306 --> 09:49.643
We've got Adrianna Alberghetti with Philip Raskin.

09:49.893 --> 09:53.354
Ryan Atwood with Lindsay Gardner.

09:56.399 --> 09:58.818
Jennifer Anderson with Jamie Barber.

10:01.320 --> 10:03.489
-Ryan Atwood?
-Lindsay Gardner.

10:05.991 --> 10:06.575
The Bait Shop?

10:07.325 --> 10:09.244
-Could be our very own CBGBs.
-"CB" what?

10:09.744 --> 10:13.498
Oh, come on, what, the only music
they had in Chino is the sounds
of gunshots and helicopters?

10:13.957 --> 10:14.832
Oh, let's get the tickets.

10:25.217 --> 10:26.218
Hmm. Hello?

10:32.599 --> 10:34.225
Hello?

10:37.770 --> 10:38.229
Okay.

10:47.154 --> 10:49.197
Hi, excuse me.
Uh, we're here about tickets.

10:50.240 --> 10:52.117
She's got headphones on.
She can't hear you.

10:52.367 --> 10:54.118
Yeah, I can see that. Thanks.

10:55.870 --> 10:58.873
-Excuse me, ma'am.
-Touch me again, I'll hurt you.

10:58.956 --> 11:03.085
-Okay, fine. What do you call this?
-Thanks.

11:03.669 --> 11:05.837
-What do you want?
-Tickets for Friday's show.
-Sold out. Sorry.

11:08.256 --> 11:10.216
-That's the last one. All set, Alex.
-Awesome.

11:10.425 --> 11:14.429
-Thank you so much. Here are your tickets,
and I threw in a couple extras.
-Cool, thanks.

11:15.054 --> 11:17.348
-Uh, why does he get tickets?
-Because he works here.

11:17.598 --> 11:21.393
-Well, if I work here, could I get tickets?
-You don't work here.

11:21.727 --> 11:26.606
-What's that right there?
-Oh, you... you wouldn't want that job.

11:26.732 --> 11:28.191
-No, sure I would. Sign me up.
-Seth...

11:28.316 --> 11:31.403
-You don't want to know the pay, the hours, job description?
-No, I'm good.

11:31.736 --> 11:36.908
-Minimum wage, long, uh, taking tickets,
cleaning toilets, and the light preparation of fried foods.

11:37.074 --> 11:39.076
-I'll be sure and wash my hands between the last two.

11:39.869 --> 11:43.288
I have to ask Nat, the owner.
But he's never here, so...

11:43.372 --> 11:48.877
-Perfect.
-Okay, I'm Alex. You can start right now.
If I don't fire you by the end of tonight,
then come back tomorrow.

11:50.503 --> 11:53.006
-I have a mop, Ryan.
-You've got a mop, bro.

11:53.256 --> 11:56.592
-So, you're doing all this for Summer?
-Yeah, for her friendship.

11:56.717 --> 11:58.594
-Wow, you really are changing.
-Yeah, I am.

11:58.719 --> 12:02.348
Changing urinal cakes, that's how committed
Seth Cohen is, to the new Seth Cohen.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.641
Okay, now you're talking
about yourself in, like, the fourth person.

12:04.766 --> 12:09.854
Well, it's a whole new dimension of selflessness, Ryan.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to the urinals.

12:19.071 --> 12:20.156
I don't know where they are.

12:28.955 --> 12:32.041
Check out the new Ryan Atwood,
studying at the breakfast table.

12:32.667 --> 12:35.503
-How are classes going?
-Tough. Physics.

12:35.628 --> 12:40.841
-Oh, physics is tough.
-It's not the work, it's the students.
A student, to be exact.

12:42.134 --> 12:50.350
-My back. Personal growth is so painful.
-My son, doing manual labor?
I never thought I'd live to see the day.

12:52.727 --> 12:54.979
Hey, Mom. Check out this ironic
twist of events.

12:55.146 --> 13:00.067
-Ryan is now a science nerd,
I'm working a blue-collar job.
-That's nice, honey.

13:01.485 --> 13:07.824
-Mom?
-Oh, Seth, don't worry. Your grandfather's situation
is very serious, but your father and I are handling it.

13:08.075 --> 13:11.619
Right. Grandpa. To tell you the truth,
I haven't even like... um...

13:12.036 --> 13:19.168
-..slept well the past couple nights,
so concerned have I been for his well-being.
-But everything is going to be okay?

13:19.377 --> 13:19.835
Right.

13:20.753 --> 13:22.755
-Right?
-Right.

13:23.589 --> 13:27.843
And what, if Grandpa, like,
he did have to go to some white-collar prison
with tennis and TiVo, then...?

13:27.968 --> 13:30.553
-Don't worry, Seth, it won't affect you.
-He wouldn't lose the company?
-No.

13:30.929 --> 13:34.098
-What about the house?
-Son. That's crazy talk.

13:39.478 --> 13:41.188
Everything's going to be fine.

13:41.855 --> 13:44.233
-I don't want you to worry, sweetie.
-I'm not.

13:44.650 --> 13:51.072
-Because it's not going to be like it was with your father.
I'm going to hold this family together.
-Fine.

13:52.407 --> 13:53.449
Marissa, listen to me.

13:54.033 --> 13:56.953
I know that there's a lot of uncertainty
in our lives right now,

13:57.745 --> 14:01.373
but I want you to believe me when I say
that Caleb is not going to jail.

14:02.207 --> 14:03.375
Oh, well, that's a shame,

14:03.751 --> 14:07.379
'cause if Caleb did go to jail,
then you'd be out on the street,
and I could go back to living with Dad.

14:30.650 --> 14:34.654
-So should we maybe exchange numbers or something?
-For what?

14:35.530 --> 14:36.572
To work on our lab report.

14:37.990 --> 14:44.371
Oh, uh... no, I already turned it in.
Don't worry, I put both our names on it.
You'll get an "A."

14:44.788 --> 14:48.750
-Funny, I thought we were supposed to...
-Yeah, I know, but, uh, here's the thing.

14:48.917 --> 14:52.754
The only reason why I transferred to Harbor
was so I could load up on A.P. courses,

14:52.879 --> 14:57.175
get accepted into Yale early and never have to look
at another cheerleader or water polo player ever again.

14:58.676 --> 15:01.845
-No offense.
-Okay, I think you got the wrong idea about me.

15:02.388 --> 15:03.305
You think I'm stupid.

15:04.890 --> 15:12.021
God doesn't give with both hands, so...
take the "A." Enjoy it. It's my treat.

15:13.106 --> 15:16.692
-Uh-huh.
-Where are you going?

15:16.943 --> 15:18.027
-Mr. Greenberg?
-Yes?

15:18.402 --> 15:21.655
That lab report Lindsay handed in,
I'm afraid I'm not quite finished with it yet.

15:22.406 --> 15:23.657
Well, it looks perfect to me.

15:23.991 --> 15:31.122
-Nice work. You guys make a great team.
-I didn't get a chance to contribute
a whole lot to that report, I mean anything

15:31.247 --> 15:31.956
-Is this true?

15:32.999 --> 15:33.750
Lindsay?

15:35.626 --> 15:40.881
Look, guys, good science requires teamwork.
Part of the assignment is working together.

15:41.090 --> 15:48.054
-If we had different partners.
-I'm keeping you together,
and giving you an additional assignment,
which you'll do together

15:48.847 --> 15:50.640
Or fail, together.

15:56.395 --> 15:58.731
Oh, yeah, you're not stupid at all.

16:07.155 --> 16:09.532
Uh, a little help here.
I think I'm going to have a hernia.

16:09.699 --> 16:12.327
I had a hernia when I was little once.
I had to have an operation.

16:12.368 --> 16:15.288
Seth, can you...?!
Oh, oh, sorry, sorry.

16:18.958 --> 16:19.417
Okay.

16:22.628 --> 16:23.837
My leg just went numb.

16:24.254 --> 16:27.090
My legs went numb, but we're cool.
That's okay, right? That's normal?

16:27.257 --> 16:28.925
-You are so out of your element.
-No, I'm not.

16:29.467 --> 16:32.053
-What are you even doing here?
-I need tickets. I'll do anything to get them.

16:32.303 --> 16:36.599
-What are you, like, a huge fan?
-Yeah, of a certain prickly brunette
named after my least favorite season.

16:36.808 --> 16:41.187
-You're doing this for a girl?
-Well, to be clear, I'm actually
getting the tickets for her and her boyfrien...

16:41.770 --> 16:45.357
Her boy... her friend that's a boy.

16:45.941 --> 16:52.155
-I'm showing her that I'm capable
of thinking of somebody other than myself.
-Huh, that's sweet. It's pathetic, but sweet.

16:52.280 --> 16:54.282
-Yeah, that's my niche--pathetic and sweet.

16:55.742 --> 16:56.826
Hmm. What?

16:57.368 --> 16:58.744
No. Mom!

16:59.703 --> 17:03.957
I don't know, maybe. Okay, I love you, too.
And say hi to Daddy.

17:05.626 --> 17:06.417
What?

17:06.627 --> 17:08.170
How old are you?

17:08.420 --> 17:11.006
-Seventeen.
-What?! Really? You don't go to school?

17:11.256 --> 17:13.049
I used to. I got kicked out.

17:13.800 --> 17:17.178
Of Corona, Matre Day, and even Newport Union.

17:17.595 --> 17:22.766
After that, my parents had enough,
said, "Go away, get a job, move out," which I did.

17:22.974 --> 17:26.520
I got my own studio on the numbered streets,
and I work here, and I've never been happier.

17:26.770 --> 17:32.650
-Yeah? This is you happy?
-Look, you barely earned these, but...

17:32.901 --> 17:38.072
Hey, right on. Thanks.
Ah! All right, Summer's going to be very stoked.

17:40.157 --> 17:45.287
On-on the band. I hear they're
really good live,and I think
the best thing for our friendship,
is like, a good, live, band.

17:45.454 --> 17:51.626
As a girl, I feel I should
probably warn you, that this
whole little game you're planning,

17:52.043 --> 17:53.586
she's gonna see right through it.

17:57.089 --> 18:00.050
Mr. Brubaker, I assure you
that my father is innocent.

18:02.428 --> 18:05.722
I... no,
he's not in the office, but...

18:07.724 --> 18:08.725
I'll have him call you.

18:10.518 --> 18:14.147
-I am so happy to see you.
-Guess who no longer works
for Partridge, Savage and Cann?

18:14.355 --> 18:16.023
-You quit?
-Or got fired.

18:16.357 --> 18:19.693
Quit slash got fired.
Lot of things were said.

18:19.902 --> 18:22.029
-None of them good.
-What happened?

18:22.071 --> 18:22.738
Your father.

18:23.655 --> 18:27.451
They said as long as I was representing him,
I wasn't working for them.

18:33.706 --> 18:36.501
It's Thursday night.
No knocking until 9:00 p.m.

18:39.170 --> 18:39.837
Cohen!

18:41.547 --> 18:45.801
How did you get in here?
Your stepmom, who's in unusually good spirits.

18:45.801 --> 18:48.803
-It's the Klonopin.
-That'd explain that eye twitch.

18:49.054 --> 18:52.474
-Listen, I'm not going to stay long.
-Actually, you can't stay at all.
The Valley is on, so you should just...

18:52.557 --> 18:53.933
Right, no,
I have something for you.

18:54.100 --> 18:58.271
-Well, unless it's a plutonium-fueled car
to take me back to last year so I can never
date you, I'm not interested.

18:58.479 --> 19:01.607
-Oh, okay, it's two tickets to
The Walkmen tomorrow night.
-I'm not going to a concert with you, ass.

19:01.732 --> 19:06.778
Hey, I'm not going, okay?
Well, I am, actually, I'm going,
but I'm not going to go with you.
These are for you and Zach.

19:07.029 --> 19:08.780
-Me and Zach?
-Yeah.

19:10.156 --> 19:14.827
-Is this a trick?
-Nope, just, you know, wanted to do
something nice for someone other than
myself for a change.

19:15.078 --> 19:17.747
So hopefully, I don't know, we can all
hang out, we can be friends.

19:18.998 --> 19:19.623
Friends.

19:21.000 --> 19:21.792
If you want.

19:24.128 --> 19:26.129
Anyways, enjoy the show.

19:27.881 --> 19:30.967
-Do you want this closed, or...?
-Yeah.

19:37.247 --> 19:41.668
Thanks for letting me stay over, and thanks
for breakfast. You finally learned
how to make French toast, huh?

19:42.168 --> 19:44.212
Mm, anytime.
Happy to have the company.

19:44.420 --> 19:47.548
-I know what you mean.
-Yeah, what do you know about being lonely?

19:47.923 --> 19:49.341
Hmm. Well, let's see.

19:49.758 --> 19:53.095
My stepfather blackmailed me
into living with my mom.

19:53.137 --> 19:55.555
My mom shipped my little sister off to boarding school,

19:55.889 --> 19:59.934
oh, and my boyfriend spent the entire summer with a girl,
who may or may not have been pregnant with his child,

20:00.101 --> 20:04.355
-and now that he is back he won't
talk to me thanks to D.J.
-Who's D.J.?

20:04.522 --> 20:06.774
Doesn't even matter since
he's not talking to me, either.

20:08.109 --> 20:12.488
Mariss, honey? You ready to go?

20:12.863 --> 20:15.407
I'm gonna go get my stuff.
Back to the gulag.

20:18.618 --> 20:21.871
She knows I heard that.
It's a little game we play.

20:21.996 --> 20:23.414
Mm-hmm. So how's Caleb?

20:23.957 --> 20:25.416
Fantastic, never better.

20:27.335 --> 20:31.589
-Facing prison, we could lose everything.
-So you gonna divorce him and take his kids?

20:31.714 --> 20:32.506
No.

20:34.174 --> 20:38.887
And you think he'd be just a little bit grateful,
show some appreciation for my personal growth.

20:41.222 --> 20:43.308
He only listens to Kirsten and Sandy.

20:43.725 --> 20:48.562
Well, the woman I married wouldn't stand for that.
Nobody puts Julie Cooper in the corner.

20:51.523 --> 20:53.484
I don't know how this is happening again.

20:55.235 --> 21:00.407
-Maybe 'cause you keep marrying for money?
-I did not marry for money.

21:00.615 --> 21:04.452
-Well, I didn't marry you for money.
-No, you married me because you were pregnant.

21:06.204 --> 21:12.584
You married me because I was pregnant.
I married you because I loved you.

21:14.294 --> 21:15.754
-Bye, Dad.
-Bye, sweetheart.

21:15.921 --> 21:17.005
-Love you.
-I love you, too.

21:20.759 --> 21:23.136
Back to the gulag.

21:31.393 --> 21:37.190
Oh, KE equals one half MB squared.
So if gravity is the constant,
and we plug in these velocities...

21:37.399 --> 21:41.611
-Ryan, what are you doing?
-Trying to do the assignment.

21:44.822 --> 21:51.370
-Except you've already finished it.
-If you flunk out of Harvard, you
can spend the rest of your life floating
in your paren

21:51.537 --> 21:55.958
-I need an academic scholarship, so...
-Okay, what makes you think my parents have
an infinity pool?

21:56.500 --> 22:00.712
I mean, they do, but they're not my parents.
I transferred in from Chino last year.

22:00.920 --> 22:05.508
-I was just like you.
-Really? You were assaulted
by the Captain of the water polo team.

22:05.842 --> 22:09.470
Okay, first of all, I've never even seen
a water polo game, match, whatever.

22:09.512 --> 22:11.513
Second of all, yeah, I was.

22:11.847 --> 22:14.933
Then I took a second to get to know the guy,
and he turned out to be a pretty good friend.

22:15.058 --> 22:20.563
-Well, um, I'm not here to make friends.
-Yeah, well, mission accomplished.

22:24.567 --> 22:27.361
-Look, clearly, this isn't working.
-Clearly.

22:27.486 --> 22:28.738
So, let's just...

22:30.573 --> 22:33.951
Look, you do the first half of the assignment,
then I'll go over it before I put it together with mine.

22:34.159 --> 22:39.164
-And I'll go over yours.
-Fine. Then I guess we'll have to get together
this weekend and go over it together.

22:39.289 --> 22:42.333
Sounds like the perfect way to spend the weekend.
See ya.

22:50.090 --> 22:54.052
-The Bait Shop. Where is that exactly?
-I don't know.

22:55.721 --> 23:00.266
-So where'd you get these from, then?
-Uh, you know, uh, Cohen.

23:01.601 --> 23:03.686
-He gave them to you?
-To us.

23:04.354 --> 23:06.397
Hmm. Why'd he do that?

23:06.564 --> 23:10.734
Um, well, he said he wants to be friends,
that he's trying to change.

23:10.943 --> 23:15.864
Um, to be less Coheny
and more like, well, a person.

23:18.909 --> 23:21.870
-Don't you think he might be trying that
just to win you back?
-No.

23:21.995 --> 23:26.958
-I mean no.
-Okay, let's just say, hypothetically,

23:27.124 --> 23:32.421
Seth really is changing. Would that mean
you'd want to get back together with him?

23:34.006 --> 23:41.638
-Well, hypothetically?
-You know what? Don't answer.
Just go to the concert alone.

23:41.805 --> 23:45.349
-Zach.
-See Seth. No bickering, no bantering, just talk.

23:45.391 --> 23:48.769
As much as I like you, Summer,
you need to figure this out with him.

23:49.019 --> 23:51.146
I need you to figure this out.

23:52.606 --> 23:56.318
Holy mack.
You are, like, such an adult.

23:56.985 --> 24:00.447
I mean, you're not insecure, you're not jealous.

24:01.156 --> 24:05.243
Are you a robot?
Huh?

24:06.869 --> 24:08.746
We had a great time over break, right?

24:10.372 --> 24:17.796
But if that's all it was supposed to be,
and we've taken this as far as possible,
just let me know.
Okay?

24:24.344 --> 24:25.303
Okay.

24:28.139 --> 24:30.558
Do you think champagne is really necessary?

24:31.684 --> 24:36.688
Ooh. Absolutely. We need to toast to quitting,
slash, getting fired. To independence.

24:37.189 --> 24:41.860
-You mean unemployment.
-Oh, Dad, just think how much time Sandy will have
to spend on your case.

24:41.901 --> 24:47.740
-Padding around the house in his black socks and his robe.
I can't wait.
-Cal, don't you have a toast to make, too?
-No.

24:48.157 --> 24:49.116
Uh, it's all right.

24:50.284 --> 24:52.411
Um, too much champagne, I get giggly.

24:52.786 --> 24:56.039
-When have you ever been giggly?
-Dad, what is it?

24:56.623 --> 25:00.043
Julie and I have been talking,
and, uh, I've come to a decision.

25:00.710 --> 25:08.050
Tomorrow morning, I'm calling a press conference
to announce that I'll be stepping down
from The Newport Group and appointing

25:08.134 --> 25:11.387
-Oh, I'm glad you listened to reason.
-Dad, wow.

25:16.850 --> 25:22.313
As of tomorrow morning, Julie will be
the new Chief Executive Officer of the Newport Group.

25:28.486 --> 25:30.988
Who needs more champagne, hmm?

26:14.236 --> 26:16.071
-Hey, thanks.
-Yup.

26:16.822 --> 26:19.908
-Any Summer sightings?
-Oh, no, not yet.

26:20.408 --> 26:21.993
What if she doesn't show?

26:22.035 --> 26:30.167
What if, after all this, she never knows the blood
and sweat and-and other people's pee
that went in to getting her those tick

26:30.334 --> 26:33.087
Well, then you'd be happy for her
'cause you're her friend, right?

26:33.253 --> 26:34.046
Totally, yeah.

26:37.174 --> 26:38.341
Hey, you came.

26:39.384 --> 26:44.847
-Where's Zach?
-Oh, um, he couldn't make it.
-Oh, that's...That's real... that's too bad.

26:45.640 --> 26:48.768
Um, let me show you to your very V.I.P. seating.
It's this way.

27:14.374 --> 27:16.918
-Hey.
-Hey.

27:18.295 --> 27:20.171
I wasn't planning on coming here tonight.

27:20.922 --> 27:22.507
I'm here for Team Summer.

27:23.466 --> 27:24.634
I'm here for Team Seth.

27:32.474 --> 27:33.600
So, what do you think?

27:34.142 --> 27:38.188
-Seth and Summer--star-crossed lovers?
-Or better off just friends.

27:38.855 --> 27:43.359
-Destined to be together?
-Or just too dysfunctional together to make it work.

27:45.236 --> 27:48.989
-I guess only time will tell.
-Yeah, I guess.

27:58.874 --> 28:00.917
You want to go in, watch the band?

28:02.335 --> 28:05.671
The last time we went to a concert,
it, uh, didn't turn out too well.

28:06.505 --> 28:07.673
Things are different now.

28:13.470 --> 28:18.266
-Well, then, come on. You like this band?
-I like Journey.

28:19.851 --> 28:22.187
Julie's waiting in the car.
You and I are gonna talk later. Yes?

28:22.812 --> 28:24.814
-I'm not sure I want to talk to you.
-Sandy.

28:25.565 --> 28:30.736
Kirsten is the one good thing in your life.
How could you do this to her? After all she
has done for you?

28:30.819 --> 28:36.324
-I have to think of my marriage.
-What does Julie Cooper know about being the CEO.
of a multimillion dollar company?

28:36.575 --> 28:43.873
-It's a figurehead position. You said so yourself.
Kirsten will continue to run the show.
-And work for Julie? Why the hell w

28:43.915 --> 28:49.336
-What do you suggest I do?
-I suggest you find a way to make it up
to Kirsten now.

28:51.255 --> 28:53.674
Unless you want Julie to be your lawyer, too.

29:24.118 --> 29:27.455
-Can you see okay?
-Yeah, I can see fine.

29:28.247 --> 29:31.667
-There's no, like, obstructed views or anything, right?
-Right.
-Okay.

29:32.668 --> 29:36.588
I just know, sometimes at shows, you can't see so well,
'cause, you know, the tall people are standing.

29:36.671 --> 29:39.215
Yeah, right, you know, but now
I'm just having a hard time hearing.

29:42.886 --> 29:47.223
-But, thanks for getting me a seat.
-No problem.

29:48.140 --> 29:55.772
-Look, Cohen, I think we need to really talk.
-Hey! There you are. Look, some guy just puked all over
an amplifier, and...
-

29:57.774 --> 30:02.904
-Why was that tattooed girl just telling you about vomit?
-She's, uh... She's my boss. I actually work here now.

30:03.071 --> 30:05.865
-What?
-Yeah. It was the only way I could get
those tickets.

30:07.867 --> 30:18.293
-But why?
-Well, I needed the tickets to show you that
I could be selfless, and I needed to be selfless
to get you to stop

30:21.337 --> 30:27.260
-Cohen, that was really sweet.
-Pathetic and sweet?
-No, just sweet.

30:42.065 --> 30:44.484
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Oh, God. Oh.

30:45.401 --> 30:47.320
Come on, I'm sor...
Summer, just wait a second.

31:06.087 --> 31:07.463
-You are unbelievable.

31:08.798 --> 31:12.634
-Not in a good way, right?
-I thought you just wanted to be friends.
-I do.

31:12.885 --> 31:17.222
-Oh, well, then what was that, that kiss?
-I don't know. I didn't mean for it to happen.
-Really?
-Yeah.

31:17.472 --> 31:20.308
-So this whole night wasn't just a plan to get me back?
-No, absolutely not.

31:22.644 --> 31:25.688
-Unless maybe that's what you want...
-Cohen!
-What? Come on! Just wait a second.

31:25.855 --> 31:30.234
-I believed you. How you were changing,
that you just wanted to be friends.
-I do! That's...

31:33.987 --> 31:41.786
Maybe I just... I can't be just friends with you.
Well, then, I guess maybe this is it for us.

31:52.562 --> 31:55.106
I'm so tired right now.
I-I didn't even sleep at all.

31:57.275 --> 32:05.783
-Oh, dude, the only thing holding my head up is my lungs.
-Sorry, man.
-I handled that Summer situation so wrong... I just...

32:06.784 --> 32:09.703
-I really shouldn't have returned her phone calls.
-She never called you.

32:09.828 --> 32:11.496
-I should've dated other girls.
-What other girls?

32:11.705 --> 32:17.293
Maybe if I'd played her hot and cold, right,
mess with her mind a little bit, then I don't know.
I think it potentially could

32:17.460 --> 32:25.259
-Look, man, I'm sorry, really, I am,
and I would love to rehash the evening
second by second one more time, but I'm late.
-

32:25.968 --> 32:31.181
-Uh... I'm meeting my lab partner.
I've got this physics assignment.
-On a Saturday?

32:31.223 --> 32:36.102
-Ryan, the whole geek routine--it was really amusing
at first, but I think you're taking things a little
bit too far.
-Thi

32:36.227 --> 32:39.856
-I just need to talk about me for, like,
several more hours at least.
-I thought you didn't do that anymore.

32:39.981 --> 32:43.943
No, that was the new Seth Cohen. I'm back, Ryan.
Cohen Classic, red, white, and me, come on.

32:44.110 --> 32:45.152
Hang in there. I won't be gone long.

33:02.460 --> 33:07.006
-Did the light of dawn make any of this a little easier to take?
-Harder, actually.

33:09.633 --> 33:11.426
-So what are you going to do?
-I'll tell you this.

33:12.010 --> 33:21.894
-I'm not going back to the office. I may tolerate Julie
as my stepmother, but I will not suffer the indignity
of her being

33:22.145 --> 33:27.733
-Well, there's a concept.
-Come on. you and me, a couple of bathrobes and black socks?
-The thought of that is so...

33:28.108 --> 33:29.151
-Liberating.
-Scary.

33:29.318 --> 33:37.033
-Forget the black socks. Barefoot, baby, barefoot.
-I can't be unemployed. I-I can't even take a vacation
for more than a we

33:37.283 --> 33:44.457
-A vacation with you is no vacation, what with the
itineraries and the sightseeing.
-I just... I can't have worked this hard

33:45.833 --> 33:46.375
I don't know.

33:48.002 --> 33:51.630
Can't quit.
Can't go back there.

33:52.130 --> 33:55.550
Well, I don't know, either.
What I do know is...

33:55.800 --> 33:59.178
I'm not the one you should be telling this to.

34:14.025 --> 34:15.902
-Hey.
-Hey.

34:16.277 --> 34:18.862
-Seth. You're in my room.
-Yeah.

34:20.447 --> 34:28.080
-How'd you get in here?
-I, uh, took a left at the grotto, and I hopped
the funicular to the dumbwaiter.
This is a... nic

34:29.248 --> 34:36.045
-So, what are you doing in here?
-Well, when I have a problem, Marissa, I like to talk about it incessantly.

34:38.380 --> 34:42.301
Yeah, no, that's it. I just think I burned out
anyone else who will listen, so...

34:44.303 --> 34:46.972
-Is now a bad time?
-I'm game.

34:51.393 --> 34:57.482
So... I think I really messed things up with
Summer last night, hurt her pretty bad.

34:58.274 --> 35:02.195
-Yeah, you did.
-Okay, not going to sugarcoat this one, huh?
-Not for you.

35:05.072 --> 35:12.120
Look, if you really want to be her friend...
then maybe you should think about just apologizing.

35:13.955 --> 35:15.957
-You know, say you were sorry.
-Yeah, no, I know.

35:17.333 --> 35:21.295
-Sounds so simple when you say it.
-I think that's a good place to start.

35:21.963 --> 35:26.175
Okay. Uh, do you happen to know where Summer is right now?
I just have this thing that I've got to tell her.

35:26.383 --> 35:31.346
-Yeah, she's at the club having lunch with her dad.
-Oh, yeah, her father. Cool, well, I'm just going to, you know...

35:31.597 --> 35:34.933
Whoa, Seth, you know what? Don't go there now.
Just, uh, give her some space.

35:35.058 --> 35:36.393
Yeah, space, totally. I know.

35:36.851 --> 35:43.608
-Hey, do you know where Ryan is?
-'Cause we had fun last night, and I thought just maybe...
-Ryan's actually at school doing

35:44.150 --> 35:47.027
-School?
-I don't know. He's kind of a dork now. Thanks.

35:58.955 --> 36:04.960
-She's agreed to supervised visitation, 20 minutes max.
-She's my daughter, Sandy. I don't need to be supervised.

36:05.377 --> 36:08.505
I'm supervising her. I'm afraid she might kill you.

36:19.474 --> 36:28.232
-I'm sorry. About yesterday.
-So that's it? No second thoughts?
You're not going to change your mind?

36:28.607 --> 36:36.823
-It's what I have to do, Kiki, for Julie... to save our marriage.
-Who is going to save the company?
-You.

36:38.032 --> 36:47.082
That's why I'm appointing you Newport Group's Chief Financial Officer.
'Cause we all know whoever controls the money controls t

36:47.708 --> 36:51.461
-Really. Does Julie know that?
-She'll find out.

36:53.380 --> 36:58.259
-I don't know.
-Come on, Kiki. The company needs you. The family needs you.

36:59.510 --> 37:00.678
I need you.

37:03.681 --> 37:09.269
Julie will get bored after a day, anyway.
Want to go to a cardio bar, fashion island...

37:11.772 --> 37:13.356
Do I get a raise?

37:17.402 --> 37:26.368
-So, um... I appreciate what you're trying to do with the...
-Okay, I'm reading here.
-Oh, uh, take your time.

37:26.744 --> 37:34.751
-I just wanted to let you know that you didn't do a bad job.
-Your work isn't terrible, either.

37:36.127 --> 37:37.670
A little rushed, maybe.

37:42.884 --> 37:54.269
So, I've been thinking. Um... I owe you an apology.
Well, several, actually.

38:03.319 --> 38:07.072
You have to actually say the words.
That's kind of how it works.

38:08.949 --> 38:21.127
I would like to extend... to you a formal acknowledgment
that I... may have, um, unintentionally...

38:26.048 --> 38:28.801
I'm sorry.
Me, too. I'm sorry.

38:29.093 --> 38:37.976
-I-I'm sorry about the coffee and the... black eye and the... tampons.
-Well, you can see why I thought you were intellectually

38:39.394 --> 38:42.772
I'm just... I'm really glad that you're not.

38:43.397 --> 38:46.859
-Your, uh, penmanship, however...
-Hey, what's wrong with my penmanship?

38:47.526 --> 38:50.612
-Nothing, just... Just, next time,
don't hold the pen between your toes.

38:50.904 --> 38:56.451
Oh, well, um, next time, don't spell "canceling"
with two L's. Yeah, that's wrong.
You want to... you want to fix that?

38:56.493 --> 39:02.623
-I... I was using the Canadian spelling.
-Oh, you're using the Canadian spelling, eh?

39:24.518 --> 39:31.733
-Hi. I'm looking for, uh, Roberts, table for two?
-We've got Roberts for three.
-Okay. Yeah.

40:26.075 --> 40:29.203
-Hey.
-Hey.

40:42.673 --> 40:50.305
If someone would've told me last year that
you and I would be the two loneliest people
in Newport, I wouldn't have believed '

40:52.015 --> 40:55.727
Well... at least not the you part.
