WEBVTT

00:05.179 --> 00:06.963
- Hey, Rodriguez.
Good news.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.312
I was going over
the harassment policy.

00:08.356 --> 00:10.140
Turns out there's
nothing in there about nerds.

00:10.184 --> 00:11.359
We can do whatever
we want to them.

00:11.402 --> 00:12.838
- Well, I'm not really dying

00:12.882 --> 00:14.579
to harass some nerds.

00:14.623 --> 00:15.537
- Oh, no, neither am I.

00:15.580 --> 00:17.365
I'm just saying
we have options.

00:18.496 --> 00:21.325
Oh, God,
you've gotta be kidding me.

00:21.369 --> 00:23.414
Okay, don't look over now.
I'm gonna need you

00:23.458 --> 00:25.199
to look over, but don't
be obvious about it, okay?

00:25.242 --> 00:27.157
Don't look now.
Look back at me.

00:27.201 --> 00:28.289
All right, okay.
Ready?

00:28.332 --> 00:30.030
Look now.
Wait, not now!

00:30.073 --> 00:31.640
- Dina, what are
you talking about?

00:31.683 --> 00:33.076
- Okay, you know Colleen
from the Bel-Ridge store?

00:33.120 --> 00:34.556
The one who sucks
and is like if Satan

00:34.599 --> 00:37.037
and a turd had a baby?
She just walked in.

00:37.080 --> 00:39.691
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
Um...

00:39.735 --> 00:42.651
But your little rivalry thing
is just kind of fun

00:42.694 --> 00:44.870
and friendly competition,
right?

00:44.914 --> 00:47.090
- No, Amy.
I hate her with the fire

00:47.134 --> 00:49.397
of a thousand suns.
Frankly, I'd like her dead.

00:49.440 --> 00:52.487
- Oh.
- Shh--she's coming this way.

00:52.530 --> 00:54.750
God, I wish I could
dropkick her dumb head.

00:54.793 --> 00:58.362
Colleen, hi!

00:58.406 --> 01:02.062
Oh, my gosh,
it's so good to see you.

01:02.105 --> 01:03.672
Vomit.

01:03.715 --> 01:06.370
I am so sorry to hear
about Bel-Ridge closing.

01:06.414 --> 01:08.372
Ugh, who knows why
these things happen?

01:08.416 --> 01:10.983
- Thanks, Deener.
I appreciate that.

01:11.027 --> 01:12.724
- So whatcha doing here?
You just pop in

01:12.768 --> 01:14.552
on your way
to the unemployment office?

01:14.596 --> 01:16.902
Well, actually, uh...

01:16.946 --> 01:18.991
Fun surprise.

01:19.035 --> 01:23.170
Colleen has been
transferred to here.

01:23.213 --> 01:27.826
- That...is a fun surprise.

01:32.614 --> 01:35.399
Colleen Wisniewski!
In my store.

01:35.443 --> 01:36.879
Why didn't you tell me?

01:36.922 --> 01:39.273
- I thought maybe you'd
overreact a little bit.

01:39.316 --> 01:41.449
- Oh, I'm overreacting a lot.
This will not stand!

01:41.492 --> 01:44.278
You have to fire her.
She calls me "Deener," Amy.

01:44.321 --> 01:46.410
Deener.
- Look, my hands are tied.

01:46.454 --> 01:48.282
She's been with
the company a long time.

01:48.325 --> 01:49.805
Corporate wanted
to relocate her.

01:49.848 --> 01:52.242
Besides, we kind of had
something to do with

01:52.286 --> 01:53.722
the closing of Bel-Ridge,

01:53.765 --> 01:55.550
so maybe we should
just be cool with it.

01:55.593 --> 01:58.118
- What and then just
let Colleen be Colleen?

01:58.161 --> 01:59.423
I don't wanna be
on that side of history.

01:59.467 --> 02:00.990
If you don't get her
out of here, I will.

02:01.033 --> 02:04.167
- No, Dina, no.
You will not.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.303
Or I will be forced
to write you up.

02:09.346 --> 02:12.871
- Really?
- In front of Colleen.

02:12.915 --> 02:14.656
- You wouldn't.

02:16.179 --> 02:18.181
- Try me.
- What is this?

02:18.225 --> 02:20.966
- Is this...
is this you being firm?

02:23.012 --> 02:24.840
- Oh, you're back.

02:24.883 --> 02:27.103
Well, I'm wearing
your vest and I'm keeping it

02:27.147 --> 02:28.757
'cause it fits me better.

02:28.800 --> 02:31.499
- No, I'm just visiting.
I may not be able to work here,

02:31.542 --> 02:33.196
but they can't stop me
from seeing my friends

02:33.240 --> 02:34.676
and using
their employee discount.

02:34.719 --> 02:36.982
- So you have to wear
that thing all the time?

02:37.026 --> 02:38.680
It's the worst.

02:38.723 --> 02:40.856
I have to charge it
every eight hours,

02:40.899 --> 02:42.597
and of course they had
to put it on my cute ankle.

02:42.640 --> 02:44.642
- My mom's ex-boyfriend Dustin

02:44.686 --> 02:46.427
had one of those,
but he took it off.

02:46.470 --> 02:47.906
- How?
They're, like, indestructible.

02:47.950 --> 02:50.474
- Well, he was 400 pounds
when he got it,

02:50.518 --> 02:52.563
but then he got
a parasite from a lake.

02:54.609 --> 02:56.828
- Maybe something like this
for our centerpieces?

02:56.872 --> 03:00.180
But with basil in it 'cause
Jerry loves Italian food.

03:00.223 --> 03:02.138
- I wish you were
having a gay wedding.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.618
I've never been
to a gay wedding.

03:03.661 --> 03:05.359
- Oh, you should
have a shrimp tower

03:05.402 --> 03:07.012
because I've heard
at some weddings

03:07.056 --> 03:08.884
they don't have enough shrimp,
and some...

03:08.927 --> 03:10.494
some people get upset.

03:10.538 --> 03:12.104
- Okay,
these are all great points,

03:12.148 --> 03:14.194
just not for a union meeting,

03:14.237 --> 03:15.717
which this was
actually supposed to be.

03:15.760 --> 03:17.197
- So have you guys
set a date yet?

03:17.240 --> 03:19.155
- Almost.
It's either gonna be

03:19.199 --> 03:20.896
the anniversary
of our first kiss

03:20.939 --> 03:23.072
or whatever
the cheapest option is.

03:23.115 --> 03:26.162
- You know, Sandra, you seem to
have a lot going on right now

03:26.206 --> 03:29.252
and I'm wondering if maybe
I should take the reins

03:29.296 --> 03:31.080
on this whole union thing
for a little bit.

03:31.123 --> 03:32.690
- Yes, thank you.

03:32.734 --> 03:34.605
I'm doing a lot
of wedding planning this week

03:34.649 --> 03:36.477
and also I'm going through all
the "Fast & Furious" movies,

03:36.520 --> 03:38.435
so I have a lot on my plate.

03:38.479 --> 03:39.958
- Got it.
Yeah.

03:40.002 --> 03:41.482
- Here are the signed cards

03:41.525 --> 03:43.179
and, FYI, the warehouse guys
took theirs back.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.833
- Wait, what?
Why?

03:44.876 --> 03:47.792
- I don't know, but Rico
has beautiful penmanship.

03:47.836 --> 03:50.317
He agreed to do all
of my invitations.

03:52.101 --> 03:56.192
- ♪ Why in the world would
anybody put chains on me ♪

03:56.236 --> 03:59.282
♪ Yeah

03:59.326 --> 04:00.849
- I guess I should've
pushed back more when

04:00.892 --> 04:02.677
corporate made me hire her,
but I just thought

04:02.720 --> 04:04.679
Dina hated her like,
"I hate Mondays."

04:04.722 --> 04:06.724
But no, she wants
to follow Monday home,

04:06.768 --> 04:08.509
blockade the door,
and burn the house down

04:08.552 --> 04:10.162
with Monday still inside.

04:10.206 --> 04:12.382
- Well, I mean I can see
where Dina is coming from.

04:12.426 --> 04:14.645
Who wouldn't hate that person?

04:14.689 --> 04:16.430
- Well, at least I
put my foot down.

04:16.473 --> 04:19.171
Dina is not going
to be messing with her.

04:19.215 --> 04:21.652
Hopefully.
How was the union meeting?

04:21.696 --> 04:24.220
- Well, uh, we learned
that Sandra is walking

04:24.264 --> 04:25.917
down the aisle to
"The Hamster Dance."

04:25.961 --> 04:28.268
Oh, and all the warehouse guys
are out.

04:28.311 --> 04:30.270
- Wait, what?
How are we gonna get any

04:30.313 --> 04:32.924
of the other stores to commit
if we can't get our own people?

04:32.968 --> 04:34.622
- Don't worry, I'm on it.
I'll--I'll talk to them,

04:34.665 --> 04:35.927
get 'em back on board.

04:35.971 --> 04:37.451
- Oh.

04:37.494 --> 04:40.584
You know, I would never
usually recommend this,

04:40.628 --> 04:42.804
but you should talk to Marcus.
I don't know,

04:42.847 --> 04:44.414
for some reason
they listen to him.

04:44.458 --> 04:45.807
I think it's 'cause he's tall.

04:45.850 --> 04:47.374
- Is he tall?

04:47.417 --> 04:50.072
I guess I just never
thought of us as tall...

04:50.115 --> 04:51.987
- Aww.

04:54.598 --> 04:57.340
God, this sucks.

04:57.384 --> 04:59.473
I just feel so useless.

04:59.516 --> 05:01.605
And not like the way
most people here are useless.

05:01.649 --> 05:03.955
I just mean, like, no purpose.

05:03.999 --> 05:06.218
- Well, I could use your help
with this quilt right now.

05:06.262 --> 05:07.916
I can't get it smooth.

05:07.959 --> 05:09.700
- Okay, you can't grapple
with it once it's down.

05:09.744 --> 05:11.702
You have to do
the loft-and-fold.

05:11.746 --> 05:12.964
- What?
- Yeah.

05:13.008 --> 05:14.705
Just loft...

05:17.708 --> 05:20.798
- And then we fold this...

05:20.842 --> 05:24.585
- Wow!
Get this guy into my bedroom.

05:24.628 --> 05:27.718
- Thank you.
- You bet.

05:27.762 --> 05:30.808
- Aww, did you see his face
when he helped you?

05:30.852 --> 05:32.636
- Makes sense.
He loves being better

05:32.680 --> 05:34.377
at stuff than people.

05:36.205 --> 05:37.859
Oh, crap.

05:37.902 --> 05:41.341
My phone's in there.
- Oh.

05:41.384 --> 05:42.559
- I don't know, man.
The guys got pretty

05:42.603 --> 05:43.995
spooked by the raid.

05:44.039 --> 05:45.867
Who knows what corporate
would do if we unionize?

05:45.910 --> 05:49.218
- Yeah, well, but we--we really
need the numbers, and I...

05:49.261 --> 05:52.264
And I-I just thought maybe...

05:52.308 --> 05:54.528
maybe you could talk to them?

05:54.571 --> 05:56.660
If you're--if you're worried
about what to say,

05:56.704 --> 05:59.228
we could go over some talking
points together, you know.

05:59.271 --> 06:01.535
- Hold up--together?

06:01.578 --> 06:03.363
As in, you and me?

06:03.406 --> 06:05.756
- Yeah, just, you know, just
quickly to go over what to say.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.018
- Right, right.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:07.062 --> 06:08.411
We hang out, chopping it up,

06:08.455 --> 06:10.935
bro by bro.
Then I go back in,

06:10.979 --> 06:14.025
get the guys back onboard,
we go celebrate for dinner.

06:14.069 --> 06:15.592
- Right, great.
And then, yeah, that's the end.

06:15.636 --> 06:16.941
- Of the beginning
of a great friendship.

06:18.334 --> 06:19.466
- You know,
I--I feel like we could

06:19.509 --> 06:21.511
get this done pretty quickly.

06:21.555 --> 06:23.208
Do you--do you
have a minute now?

06:23.252 --> 06:24.775
- I don't know.

06:24.819 --> 06:26.951
I mean, we have a lot
of ground to cover.

06:26.995 --> 06:29.824
We should probably block out
a big chunk of time.

06:29.867 --> 06:32.435
- Oh.
- Say, lunch?

06:32.479 --> 06:33.654
Yeah, okay, sure.

06:33.697 --> 06:34.698
Lunch.

06:34.742 --> 06:36.265
- Yes!
The Horsemen ride again.

06:36.308 --> 06:37.484
Meet me at my car.

06:37.527 --> 06:39.050
I'll put together a playlist.

06:39.094 --> 06:41.009
You can put on some more
comfortable clothes...

06:41.052 --> 06:43.925
- Probably just wear this.
- Ah, it's perfect.

06:45.187 --> 06:46.797
- Attention, Cloud 9 shoppers.

06:46.841 --> 06:50.192
Just a reminder about our
emotional support snake policy.

06:50.235 --> 06:53.282
We don't have one,
so please do not bring your--

06:53.325 --> 06:56.024
- You know how I said
there's no way I will ever

06:56.067 --> 06:57.982
forgive you for
what happened to my birds?

06:58.026 --> 06:59.941
Well, guess what?
There is a way.

06:59.984 --> 07:02.987
I need you to make Colleen
quit because I hate her.

07:03.031 --> 07:05.120
- Okay, so you hate
Colleen, you hate me...

07:05.163 --> 07:07.601
How many enemies do you have?
- 37.

07:07.644 --> 07:10.560
36, and then my bitch neighbor
had a baby.

07:10.604 --> 07:12.432
- All right, look, Dina,
I don't have any beef

07:12.475 --> 07:13.824
with this woman
and I don't know how you'd

07:13.868 --> 07:15.696
go about making someone quit.

07:15.739 --> 07:17.785
- Well, you managed
to make my birds quit living.

07:17.828 --> 07:19.526
I'm sure you can
figure something out.

07:19.569 --> 07:20.918
Just get her out of here

07:20.962 --> 07:23.486
and make sure
I'm not tied to it at all

07:23.530 --> 07:26.707
and I'll stop
doing things like this.

07:26.750 --> 07:28.273
- That was Elias's.

07:28.317 --> 07:30.362
- Oh, well, that's fine.

07:30.406 --> 07:32.016
Elias is also on my list.

07:38.066 --> 07:40.938
- Oh, Mateo,
thank God you're here.

07:40.982 --> 07:43.463
I can't get
these shirts to lie flat.

07:43.506 --> 07:45.029
How do you do it again?

07:45.073 --> 07:47.641
- Okay, so just...
anchor it with your thumb

07:47.684 --> 07:49.294
and pull it taut.

07:49.338 --> 07:52.167
Do the same thing
on the other side, like so.

07:52.210 --> 07:55.736
One-third, two-thirds, there.

07:55.779 --> 07:57.564
Thin as prosciutto.

07:57.607 --> 08:00.262
- Amazing.
You're so helpful.

08:00.305 --> 08:02.656
- Okay, I know what
you're doing, Chey--

08:02.699 --> 08:04.527
and thank you.

08:04.571 --> 08:07.095
- Oh, hey, Mateo,
I didn't see you there.

08:07.138 --> 08:08.966
Hey, am I doing this right?

08:09.010 --> 08:10.620
- Glen...
- 'cause I-I just--I thought

08:10.664 --> 08:11.882
they were supposed
to go on their sides...

08:11.926 --> 08:13.014
- Glen, let me help--
Glen!

08:13.057 --> 08:15.146
- Oh, hey, uh...

08:15.190 --> 08:17.758
Colleen, right?
- Yeah, Colleen.

08:17.801 --> 08:19.237
The one whose locker
you were just in.

08:19.281 --> 08:21.370
- Oh, that's--

08:21.413 --> 08:23.285
that's your locker.
I thought it was mine.

08:23.328 --> 08:26.375
- No, yours is the one
next to you that says "Garrett"

08:26.418 --> 08:28.551
with the "Neon Genesis"
sticker.

08:28.595 --> 08:30.858
- Oh, anime fan?
- Mm-hmm.

08:30.901 --> 08:32.599
Also a fan of my locker.

08:32.642 --> 08:34.644
- Sure, oh--you're gonna
head in there right now?

08:34.688 --> 08:35.906
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, of course.

08:35.950 --> 08:38.039
Your locker, go for it.
- Oh!

08:41.564 --> 08:43.479
- I, um...

08:43.523 --> 08:46.003
I put a bunch of fish
in your locker.

08:46.047 --> 08:48.963
- Mm-hmm, yeah, I can see that.

08:49.006 --> 08:51.487
- Still haven't gotten
these doors replaced, huh?

08:51.531 --> 08:52.967
- If it's good enough

08:53.010 --> 08:54.534
for the United States
Postal Service,

08:54.577 --> 08:55.665
it's good enough for me.

08:55.709 --> 08:58.320
All right.
Yeah.

08:58.363 --> 09:02.019
Chicken adobo?
Mateo's aunt made it for me.

09:02.063 --> 09:04.152
- Has that just been
sitting in your car all day?

09:04.195 --> 09:05.849
- Yeah, boy!
It's already warm.

09:05.893 --> 09:07.111
No need to microwave.

09:08.765 --> 09:10.854
- So, talking points.

09:10.898 --> 09:14.075
When you talk to the guys about
health care, I was thinking--

09:14.118 --> 09:16.338
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, dude.
You can't just tell me

09:16.381 --> 09:18.166
what to say
and then I go and I say it.

09:18.209 --> 09:19.689
- Really?
I thought we might try that.

09:19.733 --> 09:22.083
- No, you gotta find
my voice, so when I say it,

09:22.126 --> 09:24.128
it sounds natural.
And that means...

09:24.172 --> 09:26.609
a little getting
to know you period.

09:26.653 --> 09:28.611
- Okay, great.
Uh, totally.

09:28.655 --> 09:30.570
So, what should I know?

09:30.613 --> 09:33.877
- Well, for starters,
do you like this song?

09:37.794 --> 09:40.014
- Yeah--yes?
- Noice!

09:40.057 --> 09:41.581
Dude, that's my band.

09:41.624 --> 09:43.234
It's actually
just me right now,

09:43.278 --> 09:44.888
but we're looking
to fill out the lineup.

09:44.932 --> 09:48.196
Or...maybe we're
not looking anymore?

09:49.719 --> 09:53.941
- Why, exactly, would you
put fish in Colleen's locker?

09:54.985 --> 09:56.639
- Because...I'm a bully

09:56.683 --> 09:59.903
and I think this totally nice

09:59.947 --> 10:01.905
and friendly lady

10:01.949 --> 10:04.908
should...quit.

10:04.952 --> 10:07.781
- You think that, do you?

10:08.695 --> 10:11.480
- Not cool, Garrett.
She's a member of our family.

10:11.523 --> 10:14.614
Colleen, I'm so sorry
this happened to you.

10:14.657 --> 10:16.267
- It's really no big deal.
I was just looking

10:16.311 --> 10:19.923
for some Lysol because
the fish smell is escalating.

10:19.967 --> 10:21.969
- No, it is a big deal

10:22.012 --> 10:24.275
and frankly,
he needs to be punished.

10:24.319 --> 10:27.235
I'm putting you
on freezer duty.

10:27.278 --> 10:29.977
- I don't know
what freezer duty is.

10:30.020 --> 10:31.848
- Whatever,
just go get in the freezer.

10:31.892 --> 10:34.721
- Okay.

10:34.764 --> 10:37.462
- I'm so sorry, Colleen.
I really hope Garrett

10:37.506 --> 10:39.856
doesn't do anything
like this again.

10:39.900 --> 10:42.163
- So do I, but honestly

10:42.206 --> 10:44.208
this probably
won't be the last time

10:44.252 --> 10:45.949
and it probably
won't be the most fish.

10:45.993 --> 10:48.735
- It will be the last time.

10:48.778 --> 10:51.607
- Aw, Sandra.

10:51.651 --> 10:54.131
Can't believe they
got you in on this.

10:54.175 --> 10:56.743
- Huh?
- Oh, this is so stupid.

10:56.786 --> 10:58.788
I mean, it's so bland.

10:58.832 --> 11:00.790
Like you've got the same color
next to each other.

11:00.834 --> 11:02.444
Nothing's accessorized.

11:02.487 --> 11:05.186
It looks like a baby did this.

11:06.491 --> 11:10.191
You guys, Sandra?
This is too much.

11:11.192 --> 11:13.977
- I...I did my best.

11:14.021 --> 11:17.024
- Oh, it's okay.
I've got this.

11:18.721 --> 11:20.636
- Hey, Sandra, we were--

11:20.680 --> 11:23.552
- Hey, um, Mateo?
We didn't really...

11:23.595 --> 11:25.946
- You guys, um,
this is the nicest thing

11:25.989 --> 11:27.512
anyone's ever done for me.

11:27.556 --> 11:29.166
And the fact that
you got everyone

11:29.210 --> 11:32.517
in the store in on it...
I...

11:32.561 --> 11:34.389
I can't even.

11:34.432 --> 11:37.435
- Well, yeah, we'd do
anything for you, Mateo.

11:37.479 --> 11:40.177
Anything you think we did.

11:40.221 --> 11:42.179
- Attention, shoppers,
we have a sale today

11:42.223 --> 11:44.834
in our pets department,
two for one goldfish.

11:44.878 --> 11:48.011
In sporting goods, fishing rods
are fishy percent off.

11:48.055 --> 11:50.579
I think that's
supposed to be 50.

11:50.622 --> 11:52.233
And finally...

11:55.236 --> 11:57.760
Come to customer service
to get your pound

11:57.804 --> 12:02.112
of locker fish from me,
Garrett the Fish McFish.

12:02.156 --> 12:04.506
Have a heavenly day.

12:04.549 --> 12:06.726
Very funny.

12:06.769 --> 12:09.554
- You put fish in my locker, I
put fish in your announcements.

12:09.598 --> 12:11.861
- Fair enough.
I'm--I'm sorry about that.

12:11.905 --> 12:15.256
- Oh, it's no big deal.
I can handle rookie hazing.

12:15.299 --> 12:18.607
And don't worry, I will get you
your dead fish back ASAP.

12:18.650 --> 12:21.784
- Well you know what,
those fish are yours to keep.

12:21.828 --> 12:23.568
- Aw, that's really generous.

12:23.612 --> 12:25.701
- I have a big heart.
- I bet you do,

12:25.745 --> 12:29.226
but I am very worried that
you might meet a hungry cat

12:29.270 --> 12:31.359
and need the dead fish, so...

12:31.402 --> 12:33.622
I should give you my number.

12:34.841 --> 12:37.365
- I guess you could do that.

12:37.408 --> 12:39.193
- You have to fire Colleen.
- Garrett, I know

12:39.236 --> 12:40.542
Dina put you up to this.

12:40.585 --> 12:42.979
- Yes, okay,
Dina did put me up to that,

12:43.023 --> 12:44.720
but that's not
what this is about.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.853
I think that there--I think
there might be something there.

12:46.896 --> 12:48.550
Like...between the two of us.

12:48.593 --> 12:50.291
- How?
You just met.

12:50.334 --> 12:53.337
- She likes anime, okay?
She made some jokes.

12:53.381 --> 12:55.818
I don't--I don't have
a lot of boxes to check.

12:55.862 --> 12:59.474
- God...no, no, no.
That can't happen.

12:59.517 --> 13:02.433
Dina would lose her mind.
That would be bad for me,

13:02.477 --> 13:04.435
bad for the store,
bad for everybody.

13:04.479 --> 13:05.697
- Okay, well, yeah,
I-I agree.

13:05.741 --> 13:07.264
That's why you
need to do something.

13:07.308 --> 13:09.049
Can't you just transfer her
to another store?

13:09.092 --> 13:10.877
- I mean,
I guess I could call around,

13:10.920 --> 13:13.618
but it's not like
there's that many empty spots.

13:13.662 --> 13:16.273
In the meantime, can you
just not sleep with her?

13:16.317 --> 13:19.276
- I...wish I could
promise you that,

13:19.320 --> 13:21.322
but I couldn't stop myself
from sleeping with Dina

13:21.365 --> 13:23.237
after I killed her birds.

13:23.280 --> 13:26.153
- Are you seriously
saying you can't promise

13:26.196 --> 13:27.763
to not sleep with
one of your coworkers?

13:27.807 --> 13:29.896
- That's--that's pretty
much what I'm saying.

13:32.855 --> 13:35.640
- I don't care what they said.
You are beautiful,

13:35.684 --> 13:36.859
you are sexy,
and any guy would kill

13:36.903 --> 13:38.034
for a night alone with you.

13:38.078 --> 13:39.470
All right, Mom, I gotta bounce.

13:39.514 --> 13:41.168
Say bye to Jonah.

13:41.211 --> 13:43.823
- Bye, Mrs. White.
It was nice to meet you.

13:43.866 --> 13:46.826
This whole hour
has just flown by.

13:48.479 --> 13:50.090
- Fish in the locker?

13:50.133 --> 13:51.787
What kind of bush-league
crap is that?

13:51.831 --> 13:52.875
- Well, I didn't put
a lot of thought in it

13:52.919 --> 13:54.137
because I didn't want to do it.

13:54.181 --> 13:55.747
- Okay,
you're gonna need some help,

13:55.791 --> 13:58.141
so I'm willing
to let you borrow this.

13:58.185 --> 14:00.274
- Dina, you still
have that bag of meth?

14:00.317 --> 14:02.711
We talked about this.
You gotta turn that in.

14:02.754 --> 14:03.799
- Then what would
I do in situations like this

14:03.843 --> 14:05.540
when I need a bag of meth?

14:05.583 --> 14:08.369
Okay, so, you're talking
to Colleen, you casually...

14:08.412 --> 14:09.979
drop it at her feet.

14:10.023 --> 14:12.764
I bring Amy by
and, "Oh, Colleen,

14:12.808 --> 14:14.984
did this just fall
out of your pocket?"

14:15.028 --> 14:17.726
And she's all, "What?
That's not--"

14:17.769 --> 14:19.293
and Amy's like,
"Bup, bup, bup, Colleen.

14:19.336 --> 14:21.295
"I don't wanna hear it.
You're fired.

14:21.338 --> 14:24.211
And on your way out, give
that bag of meth back to Dina."

14:24.254 --> 14:25.908
- All right, look.
Dina, I wanna help you out,

14:25.952 --> 14:28.302
but this is a little extreme.

14:28.345 --> 14:30.521
- You know,
most reasonable people

14:30.565 --> 14:33.350
would expect one deed
of penance per dead bird,

14:33.394 --> 14:37.137
and here I am very generously
offering you a package deal.

14:37.180 --> 14:39.356
All you have to do
is plant some illegal drugs

14:39.400 --> 14:41.706
on an innocent,
but terrible woman.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.320
- It's supposed
to be a pyramid.

14:46.363 --> 14:48.148
I think you, of all people,
could handle that.

14:48.191 --> 14:51.978
- I'm Syrian, not Egyptian.
- Clearly.

14:52.935 --> 14:55.764
Don't mind me--just
making it not look like crap.

14:55.807 --> 14:57.505
Labels out.

14:57.548 --> 14:59.855
Thank you.

15:01.204 --> 15:04.555
Sorry, she's not
usually this bad.

15:04.599 --> 15:05.861
- Heavy stuff

15:05.905 --> 15:07.558
goes in the bottom...

15:07.602 --> 15:09.734
because of gravity.

15:09.778 --> 15:11.214
- Well, I mean
there's always the option

15:11.258 --> 15:13.390
of not hooking up with Colleen.

15:13.434 --> 15:15.610
- Yeah, see, that just
doesn't make any sense to me.

15:15.653 --> 15:18.004
- I...

15:18.047 --> 15:20.920
- J-bone!
There you are, buddy.

15:20.963 --> 15:24.010
All right,
I am ready to talk union.

15:24.053 --> 15:25.925
I was thinking we
could do it over some hoops.

15:25.968 --> 15:29.015
Maybe some one-on-one,
a little Horse,

15:29.058 --> 15:31.234
or just, like,
run some passing drills?

15:31.278 --> 15:33.758
- Uh, you know what,
as--as much as I'd like to, um,

15:33.802 --> 15:36.674
to hoop with you, I gotta--

15:36.718 --> 15:38.111
Garrett needs me
to help with the...

15:38.154 --> 15:40.026
- No, I don't.
- Yeah, yeah, the--you know,

15:40.069 --> 15:42.376
the--the--the announcement
that you...

15:42.419 --> 15:44.465
- Already did it, man.
You're good to go--hoop it up.

15:44.508 --> 15:48.208
- Oh...great, thanks, friend.
- Anytime, buddy.

15:48.251 --> 15:50.384
- Nice, let's do it!
Shirts versus skins.

15:50.427 --> 15:52.081
I'm wearing a shirt, so...
- Okay, you know what, Marcus,

15:52.125 --> 15:53.865
no, I'm not doing this, okay?

15:53.909 --> 15:55.476
I know I'm supposed
to go through you,

15:55.519 --> 15:56.738
but I'm just gonna go
in there and I'm gonna talk

15:56.781 --> 15:57.869
to the warehouse guys myself.

15:57.913 --> 15:59.045
- You need me, okay?

15:59.088 --> 16:00.698
These guys don't relate to you.

16:00.742 --> 16:02.396
These guys don't listen to NPR

16:02.439 --> 16:04.572
and eat Faberge eggs
for breakfast.

16:04.615 --> 16:07.096
- I would hope nobody...
- They respond to guys' guys.

16:07.140 --> 16:08.619
You know,
guys who work with their hands,

16:08.663 --> 16:10.273
who know how to grill a burger.

16:10.317 --> 16:12.101
- Marcus...
- The kind of guys

16:12.145 --> 16:14.538
who would chug a liter
of barbecue sauce just

16:14.582 --> 16:17.367
'cause someone dared them to.
- I disagree, all right?

16:17.411 --> 16:19.021
I think they
are gonna listen to reason.

16:19.065 --> 16:20.980
You underestimate these guys.

16:21.023 --> 16:23.243
I'm gonna go in there
and I'm not coming out until

16:23.286 --> 16:25.767
every single one of them
signs these cards.

16:25.810 --> 16:27.769
- Okay, but you're gonna fail.

16:27.812 --> 16:31.294
And I'll be there for you when
you do, 'cause we're friends.

16:31.338 --> 16:33.731
- Come on, Amy.
There's a very angry customer

16:33.775 --> 16:35.211
and she only speaks
Spanish, so, uh,

16:35.255 --> 16:37.126
we need you to translate.
- Get Cody to help.

16:37.170 --> 16:38.910
My Spanish isn't
even that good.

16:38.954 --> 16:40.260
- No, hers isn't either.
That's why it has to be you.

16:40.303 --> 16:42.218
I'm sure she's here somewhere.

16:42.262 --> 16:44.525
- Oh, my God.
These dogs in bathing suits

16:44.568 --> 16:46.396
make me really uncomfortable.

16:46.440 --> 16:47.919
- Yeah, right?
I mean, it's so weird.

16:47.963 --> 16:49.225
They should be
wearing more tops

16:49.269 --> 16:50.966
'cause dogs have,
like, ten nipples.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.186
- Oh, so you know
zoology and math?

16:53.229 --> 16:54.883
- Well...
- You know what,

16:54.926 --> 16:57.016
get Cody to help,
or give her a free slushie.

16:57.059 --> 16:59.366
Everyone speaks slushie.
I don't have time for this.

17:01.107 --> 17:03.631
- So, did you
come over here to...

17:03.674 --> 17:05.937
ask me out, maybe?
Or...

17:05.981 --> 17:08.070
are you just lurking, or...

17:08.114 --> 17:09.985
- Yeah, um, sure.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.988
Did you want to get
some tacos after work?

17:13.032 --> 17:16.035
- Yeah, I would.
- Okay.

17:16.078 --> 17:18.863
All right, so,
this turned into a date.

17:22.998 --> 17:24.434
- Uh, hey--uh, guys?

17:24.478 --> 17:26.349
Guys--is it--is it all guys?

17:26.393 --> 17:29.178
We should probably talk about
that, but, uh, another day.

17:29.222 --> 17:31.180
So, look.
I get that there are

17:31.224 --> 17:33.791
probably some reservations
about this whole union thing,

17:33.835 --> 17:36.968
you know, and yeah,
I don't seem like you,

17:37.012 --> 17:38.796
you know, at first,
because I'm more

17:38.840 --> 17:41.016
booksmart or--not even,
not even smarter,

17:41.060 --> 17:43.497
just--just like, um,
you know, better educated.

17:43.540 --> 17:45.151
Or--not better--gross,
why would I...

17:45.194 --> 17:48.241
- What are you saying?
- Uh, what I'm saying is,

17:48.284 --> 17:51.635
I get that this
is a little scary,

17:51.679 --> 17:54.247
but what corporate is gonna do
if we don't do this

17:54.290 --> 17:56.205
is even scarier, okay?

17:56.249 --> 17:59.643
So, you know, you, you, you,

17:59.687 --> 18:02.472
you're all at risk
of being replaced by machines.

18:02.516 --> 18:04.300
- So I'm good?

18:04.344 --> 18:06.302
- Uh, no, you're--
you're at risk, too.

18:06.346 --> 18:07.825
- You didn't point at me.

18:07.869 --> 18:10.350
- Okay,
the pointing was arbitrary.

18:10.393 --> 18:12.700
All right, look,
a union is our best shot

18:12.743 --> 18:16.225
at protecting our jobs.
Okay, so who's with me?

18:16.269 --> 18:19.185
- I don't know.
Can we trust this guy?

18:19.228 --> 18:20.795
- Honestly, I'm not sure.

18:20.838 --> 18:22.492
- Guys, of course
you can trust me, okay?

18:22.536 --> 18:23.972
I'm--I'm--I'm a fighter.

18:24.015 --> 18:26.714
You know, we are--
we are the same.

18:26.757 --> 18:28.324
We are the every man, you know?

18:28.368 --> 18:30.109
I--you--and we--we share--

18:30.152 --> 18:31.849
look, you wanna--
you wanna watch me, uh,

18:31.893 --> 18:33.329
you wanna watch me
chug this ranch?

18:33.373 --> 18:34.678
I'm gonna slam this ranch.

18:34.722 --> 18:36.680
Watch me slam this ranch!

18:36.724 --> 18:39.161
Okay.
Mmm...

18:46.342 --> 18:48.562
- He's in my band.

18:48.605 --> 18:50.912
- What do you mean you're
going on a date with her?

18:50.955 --> 18:53.132
- Well, it was either that
or plant crystal meth on her.

18:53.175 --> 18:55.699
- Okay, so in the whole world,
those were your two options?

18:55.743 --> 18:57.179
- It seemed
like it at the time.

18:57.223 --> 18:59.355
- Well, guess what I just heard

18:59.399 --> 19:02.010
from my dear friend Colleen?

19:02.053 --> 19:05.144
You two are going out.

19:06.101 --> 19:08.582
- Well, it's true.
I'm going out with Colleen.

19:08.625 --> 19:11.150
- Oh man, Garrett.

19:11.193 --> 19:14.022
That is...messed up.

19:14.065 --> 19:16.894
You're gonna go out
with Colleen to get her

19:16.938 --> 19:19.549
to fall in love with you just
so you can break her heart?

19:19.593 --> 19:22.204
- Wait...what are
you talking about?

19:22.248 --> 19:24.206
- Yeah.
Yes, Amy,

19:24.250 --> 19:27.731
that's what I'm doing.
I just felt so bad

19:27.775 --> 19:29.733
for what I did to your birds
that I didn't think

19:29.777 --> 19:32.127
getting Colleen
to quit was good enough.

19:32.171 --> 19:35.435
- Wait, so all of this
is just...a long con?

19:35.478 --> 19:36.740
- Oh, yeah.

19:36.784 --> 19:38.481
- I can't believe
I fell for this.

19:38.525 --> 19:40.222
Of course you're
not interested in Colleen.

19:40.266 --> 19:43.138
No one is.
This is really good.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.227
All right, we gotta
make sure you win her over.

19:45.271 --> 19:46.576
- Okay...
- And forget tacos.

19:46.620 --> 19:48.361
You need to woo this woman.

19:48.404 --> 19:49.840
I'll make a reservation
somewhere romantic

19:49.884 --> 19:51.233
and I'll give them
my credit card.

19:51.277 --> 19:52.278
I mean, it's the least I can do

19:52.321 --> 19:53.627
since you're doing this for me.

19:53.670 --> 19:55.019
- Oh, yeah,
the least you could do.

19:55.063 --> 19:56.412
- Can't believe you.
- Yeah.

19:56.456 --> 19:58.109
- I can't believe him either.

19:58.153 --> 20:00.111
That's...totally...

20:00.155 --> 20:02.201
insane.

20:02.244 --> 20:04.333
- Vendor, then item number,
then delete.

20:04.377 --> 20:05.813
Allison.

20:07.467 --> 20:09.860
- Uh, hey, Mateo.

20:09.904 --> 20:12.254
Um, you know how you've
been helping everyone out...

20:12.298 --> 20:13.864
like, a lot?

20:13.908 --> 20:15.214
- And you've
really helped fill

20:15.257 --> 20:17.607
that Mateo-sized hole
in the store.

20:17.651 --> 20:19.783
- You guys, stop.
I can't.

20:19.827 --> 20:22.264
- What?
- It's too much.

20:22.308 --> 20:23.787
Okay, at first it was sweet,

20:23.831 --> 20:25.615
but now I'm just doing
everyone's jobs for them

20:25.659 --> 20:27.182
and I'm not even getting paid.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.271
You took advantage
of my greatest weakness...

20:29.315 --> 20:30.925
my enormous heart.

20:33.188 --> 20:34.711
- Have fun, you two.

20:34.755 --> 20:37.279
Get dessert.
Order a nice bottle of wine.

20:37.323 --> 20:38.541
Splurge!

20:38.585 --> 20:41.327
- So, great news.

20:41.370 --> 20:43.981
Crestwood's assistant manager
had a pallet dropped on her.

20:44.025 --> 20:45.635
I mean, it's bad.
She's gonna be fine.

20:45.679 --> 20:47.289
She's getting a ton of money.
But I begged them

20:47.333 --> 20:49.552
to take Colleen,
and they said yes.

20:49.596 --> 20:51.641
- Wait, so Colleen's
out of the store

20:51.685 --> 20:53.295
and Garrett's gonna
break her heart?

20:53.339 --> 20:55.036
- Mm-hmm.

20:55.079 --> 20:57.168
- This day just keeps
getting better and better.

20:57.212 --> 21:01.434
- Got the warehouse guys back
onboard without Marcus's help.

21:01.477 --> 21:02.696
- Oh, good.
- Yep, yep.

21:02.739 --> 21:03.827
It turns out
at the end of the day,

21:03.871 --> 21:05.394
people just wanna connect

21:05.438 --> 21:06.917
on a human level, you know?

21:06.961 --> 21:09.529
- Uh-huh.
Uh, what's all over your shirt?

21:09.572 --> 21:12.009
- That is...a gallon of ranch.

21:12.053 --> 21:14.185
I had to chug
a gallon of ranch.

21:14.229 --> 21:16.013
Is that, uh...

21:16.057 --> 21:17.580
- There it is.

21:19.539 --> 21:23.020
- A bag of meth.
- Ah.
