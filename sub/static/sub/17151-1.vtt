01:33.160 --> 01:36.728
Lettuce, tomato, onion.

01:36.730 --> 01:38.764
Uh, pickles.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.833
And tzatziki sauce.

01:40.835 --> 01:43.535
Oh, and, uh,
a little hot sauce, too.

01:43.537 --> 01:46.205
Hot sauce, okay.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.211
Hi.

01:52.213 --> 01:53.779
Thank you, ma'am.

01:53.781 --> 01:56.682
You're welcome. God bless.

02:07.594 --> 02:08.526
Hi!

02:08.529 --> 02:09.261
Hey, lady.

02:09.263 --> 02:12.764
"O god, why do you
cast us off forever?

02:12.766 --> 02:13.732
Why does your anger smoke

02:13.734 --> 02:16.201
against
the sheep of your pasture?

02:16.203 --> 02:20.205
Remember your congregation,
which you acquired long ago,

02:20.207 --> 02:23.275
which you redeemed to be
the tribe of your heritage."

02:26.714 --> 02:28.647
Can I just...

02:31.484 --> 02:34.319
Sisters of mercy.

02:34.321 --> 02:35.921
Who? Colleen?

02:35.923 --> 02:40.392
No, we don't have
any sisters named that.

02:41.327 --> 02:44.329
No, ma'am, I don't know.

02:44.331 --> 02:46.265
Do you know which order?

02:46.267 --> 02:48.800
Oh, yeah, then I
definitely don't know.

02:48.802 --> 02:52.771
There are so many.
I'm sorry.

02:53.640 --> 02:55.574
Oh, that's okay.

02:55.576 --> 02:59.411
Hope you find her.
God bless.

03:40.920 --> 03:43.956
I think the people understand.

03:43.958 --> 03:47.359
I'm a war president.

03:47.361 --> 03:49.728
I hear the voices,
and I read the front page,

03:49.730 --> 03:53.532
and I know the speculation,
but I'm the decider.

03:53.534 --> 03:55.567
But I'm the decider.

03:55.569 --> 04:01.240
And I ask you whether you
recall the title of that PDB.

04:01.242 --> 04:02.641
I believe the title was

04:02.643 --> 04:08.280
<i>bin laden determined to attack
inside the United States.</i>

04:08.916 --> 04:12.317
You know that, that old
beach boys song <i> Barbara Ann?</i>

04:12.319 --> 04:13.752
We're going to do
what we have to do

04:13.754 --> 04:15.854
to protect
the United States of America.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.456
The message
of these brave men and women

04:17.458 --> 04:22.027
who are serving over there
is "let us win."

04:22.796 --> 04:25.264
And night fell
on a different world,

04:25.266 --> 04:29.001
on a world where freedom itself
is under attack.

04:47.453 --> 04:48.487
Sorry.

04:48.489 --> 04:50.389
You're Debbie's friend.

04:50.391 --> 04:50.822
Yeah.

04:50.824 --> 04:53.425
You're the nun.

04:53.427 --> 04:53.992
Um, yeah...

04:53.994 --> 04:58.730
So, you, like, devoted your life
to Christ and everything?

05:00.901 --> 05:01.500
You did.

05:01.502 --> 05:02.801
I thought the show
was really creative.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.770
Thank you. That's all right.
I don't want to mess with you.

05:04.772 --> 05:07.639
It's just I've never
seen one before.

05:07.641 --> 05:10.042
I've never seen
a real live nun before.

05:10.044 --> 05:11.410
It's okay.

05:11.412 --> 05:11.877
Sorry.

05:11.879 --> 05:14.646
Do you wanna do
some blow with us?

05:14.648 --> 05:17.049
Oh, I can't.

05:17.051 --> 05:17.916
Sorry. Thanks.

05:17.918 --> 05:20.085
I have no idea
how you would get, like,

05:20.087 --> 05:23.755
I don't know, like a record deal
or a record company

05:23.757 --> 05:24.923
or any of that, but...

05:24.925 --> 05:26.758
I just think like,
you're so talented,

05:26.760 --> 05:30.629
and, and if you can,
then, and if you'd like to,

05:30.631 --> 05:31.363
then you should,

05:31.365 --> 05:34.599
you should share
your gift with the world.

05:35.401 --> 05:36.702
I don't know.
I don't know.

05:36.704 --> 05:40.972
Just that's what my parents
always told me.

05:41.774 --> 05:46.478
The next
Manhattan-bound l train

05:46.480 --> 05:51.583
will depart
in approximately 37 minutes.

06:11.872 --> 06:14.439
Sorry.

06:19.012 --> 06:22.581
Do you remember
what I said to you

06:22.583 --> 06:27.152
when you first joined our order,
Joan of arc?

06:27.154 --> 06:28.587
Mm-hmm.

06:28.589 --> 06:30.756
Do you think I was right?

06:32.892 --> 06:35.093
No.

06:35.095 --> 06:36.995
You think I was wrong.

06:40.967 --> 06:42.934
I'm sorry.

06:48.141 --> 06:51.176
You're very close
to your first vows,

06:51.178 --> 06:56.882
and I'm having trouble believing
that you're really devoted...

06:56.884 --> 06:58.583
I am devoted.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.118
Sorry.

07:02.722 --> 07:05.590
I don't want you
to not have fun.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.426
You're young.
You should have fun.

07:07.428 --> 07:09.961
But if this community
isn't offering you

07:09.963 --> 07:12.531
enough fun already...

07:17.904 --> 07:19.905
What's wrong?

07:27.647 --> 07:29.614
Hey.

07:29.616 --> 07:32.083
I like your sunglasses.

07:34.487 --> 07:36.521
Thanks.

08:53.065 --> 08:56.668
You want to borrow my car,
don't you?

08:58.938 --> 09:01.306
For how long?

09:02.608 --> 09:06.545
Um, I don't know.

09:06.547 --> 09:07.546
Three or four days.

09:07.548 --> 09:12.117
You must tell me a number
and stick with it.

09:16.622 --> 09:19.691
It took god six days
to create the universe.

09:19.693 --> 09:23.295
You should be able to get
your act together in five.

09:25.865 --> 09:28.300
Okay.

09:28.302 --> 09:31.069
Okay, five days.

09:33.239 --> 09:35.974
Use the time wisely, sister.

12:58.410 --> 12:59.978
Hello?

13:23.302 --> 13:24.936
Jacob?

13:29.875 --> 13:31.810
Hello?

15:01.967 --> 15:04.903
<i>Starlings are
medium-sized passerines.</i>

15:04.905 --> 15:08.306
<i>The shortest-bodied species

15:08.308 --> 15:12.076
<i>but the lightest-weight species

15:20.019 --> 15:21.986
holy cow.

15:23.022 --> 15:24.522
Hi, dad.

15:32.965 --> 15:35.066
You look great.

15:37.303 --> 15:40.204
You smell a little weird.

15:43.475 --> 15:46.945
You smell like always.

15:48.515 --> 15:50.415
Oh, Chiclet!

15:50.417 --> 15:53.051
The more things change, huh?

15:53.053 --> 15:54.218
Hi!

15:54.220 --> 15:54.953
Joani!

15:54.955 --> 15:56.187
I'm getting the bags!

15:56.189 --> 15:58.990
Joani, get in here, now!

16:08.300 --> 16:10.234
Hi, mom.

16:11.103 --> 16:13.471
Oh!

16:13.473 --> 16:17.275
Oh, sweet pea.

16:18.377 --> 16:20.278
Oh, you're home.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.146
Oh, you're home!

16:22.148 --> 16:24.349
Sweet pea!

16:24.351 --> 16:27.285
- Mmm!
- Oh!

16:28.253 --> 16:31.723
Look what the cat dragged in.

16:31.725 --> 16:33.024
Hey, Colleen.

16:33.026 --> 16:35.059
Hey, Tricia.

16:39.198 --> 16:42.467
Did you, did you get my emails?

16:42.469 --> 16:44.035
Uh, yeah.

16:44.037 --> 16:44.502
Yeah?

16:44.504 --> 16:48.406
Um, I'm on, um, medicine now.

16:48.408 --> 16:50.341
Did you know that?

16:51.310 --> 16:52.210
That's good, mom.

16:52.212 --> 16:57.115
Yeah.
I'm so happy you're home.

16:57.117 --> 17:00.051
Did you see your brother?
Did you say hi?

17:00.053 --> 17:01.352
I didn't know
he was home until...

17:01.354 --> 17:03.321
Oh, I'm going to go,
I'm going to go get him.

17:03.323 --> 17:04.422
No, you don't have to do that.

17:04.424 --> 17:06.156
Yes, I'm going to go get him.

17:06.159 --> 17:07.425
Mom!

17:08.160 --> 17:10.127
Mom!

17:11.563 --> 17:15.165
Hey, want to see something cool?

17:16.335 --> 17:18.636
Hey, come on.

Pretty neat, right?

17:43.696 --> 17:46.097
<i>a call today at pro-star.</i>

17:46.099 --> 17:48.466
That was really something.

17:53.473 --> 17:56.774
I hope you're still hungry
for dinner.

So, you really stuck
with that vegetarian thing, huh?

18:21.601 --> 18:22.233
Yep.

18:22.235 --> 18:25.203
When you were little,
all you wanted were nuggets.

18:25.205 --> 18:26.537
Chicken nuggets.

18:26.539 --> 18:31.809
"Papa" nuggets, remember?
Big ol' papa nugget.

18:33.279 --> 18:37.482
Oh, man, this
really hits the spot.

18:39.518 --> 18:41.486
Is anybody going to get that?

18:45.491 --> 18:51.195
They wanna put your brother
on CNN.

19:34.274 --> 19:36.174
Colleen?

19:37.209 --> 19:38.276
Colleen.

19:38.278 --> 19:39.477
Yeah?

19:39.479 --> 19:41.245
Your mom and I
are dropping Tricia off

19:41.247 --> 19:42.513
and heading into the office.

19:42.515 --> 19:45.883
Are you going to be okay here
by yourself?

19:45.885 --> 19:47.818
Uh, yeah.

19:47.820 --> 19:53.925
Hey, give your brother
some space, okay?

19:53.927 --> 19:56.194
Okay.

19:56.929 --> 19:58.729
<i>We love you, mama and papa!</i>

Uh, hey, there.
Is Jacob home?

20:32.232 --> 20:38.869
Uh, I don't think he's taking
any visitors right now.

20:38.871 --> 20:42.840
Wait a second.
Shoot. Colleen?

20:43.709 --> 20:44.375
Yeah.

20:44.377 --> 20:46.877
Look at you, girl, all grown up!

20:46.879 --> 20:48.913
Like a, like a librarian
or something.

20:48.915 --> 20:51.415
I barely recognized you
without all the, uh, the,

20:51.417 --> 20:53.251
you know, the Marilyn Manson
stuff on your face.

20:53.253 --> 20:59.590
It's like the ugly duckling has
turned into a beautiful swan.

21:01.928 --> 21:06.731
So, uh, we should come back
a little later, then?

22:12.865 --> 22:14.865
Jacob?

22:14.867 --> 22:17.601
Who is it?

22:17.603 --> 22:20.037
Uh...

22:20.039 --> 22:22.406
It's your sister.

22:33.852 --> 22:35.920
Welcome home.

22:40.025 --> 22:41.625
Thanks.

22:42.728 --> 22:44.862
You look different.

22:53.939 --> 22:56.974
Is it okay to hug you?

22:56.976 --> 22:58.576
Sure.

23:08.553 --> 23:09.854
I'm sorry.

23:09.856 --> 23:13.524
Don't worry about it.

23:13.526 --> 23:15.459
I love you.

23:23.602 --> 23:25.936
Do you wanna hang out?

23:25.938 --> 23:28.172
Not really.

24:09.848 --> 24:10.815
Emily.

24:10.817 --> 24:12.850
Oh, my god. Colleen!

24:12.852 --> 24:16.120
You should tell me
when you're back in town!

24:16.122 --> 24:18.456
Well, it's an unexpected visit.

24:18.458 --> 24:23.027
Oh, my god!
You're, like, a real nun now.

24:23.029 --> 24:24.695
Almost.

24:24.697 --> 24:28.899
Everybody's talking
about your brother.

24:28.901 --> 24:32.036
His whole face, huh?

24:32.038 --> 24:32.870
Mm-hmm.

24:32.872 --> 24:34.171
I'm so sorry.

24:34.173 --> 24:36.807
I had such a crush on him
in high school.

24:36.809 --> 24:40.644
I was at my parents'
vacation house,

24:40.646 --> 24:43.214
but they didn't actually say
I could be there,

24:43.216 --> 24:47.785
so technically I was squatting.

24:49.855 --> 24:51.655
Oh, wow.

24:51.657 --> 24:55.726
Yeah, remember this place?

24:55.728 --> 24:58.195
It looks exactly the same.

25:04.569 --> 25:09.573
I'm gonna go take a shower,
wash off the granola.

25:09.575 --> 25:11.709
Make yourself at home.

25:11.711 --> 25:13.143
Okay.

25:33.032 --> 25:34.265
I came into work,
and he was like,

25:34.267 --> 25:37.535
"you're ugly,
and you have a bad personality,"

25:37.537 --> 25:39.870
and so I hit him in the eyes.

25:39.872 --> 25:44.141
And then he had to get surgery,
but that was his fault because...

25:44.143 --> 25:47.678
Yeah, yeah,
and I had to listen to them

25:47.680 --> 25:48.779
talk about how great they are

25:48.781 --> 25:53.984
and, like, how they're
doing this artist residency

25:53.986 --> 25:56.186
in Barcelona
and all these things.

25:56.188 --> 25:59.924
And that's annoying,
but then I realized...

26:05.964 --> 26:07.631
Wow.

26:09.301 --> 26:12.136
I hope this is okay.

26:12.138 --> 26:14.238
Whatever, dude.

26:17.342 --> 26:20.210
You sure you don't want one?

26:22.714 --> 26:24.248
Is that like a nun thing?

26:24.250 --> 26:28.285
It's still a Colleen thing.

26:28.287 --> 26:30.154
Wow.

26:32.123 --> 26:35.859
Do you still have your v-card?

26:35.861 --> 26:37.995
Lifetime member.

26:38.798 --> 26:42.933
How were we friends
in high school?

26:43.602 --> 26:46.637
No one else liked us.

26:46.639 --> 26:49.673
Oh, yeah.

26:49.675 --> 26:52.643
So, why did you move home?

26:59.885 --> 27:04.021
<i>We are here inside
the Findlay corp chicken farm.</i>

27:04.023 --> 27:10.294
<i>Findlay slaughters thousands
of innocent birds every day.</i>

27:10.296 --> 27:11.962
That's awful.

27:11.964 --> 27:17.768
Yeah, so, I had to get out
of Michigan pretty fast.

27:17.770 --> 27:19.303
Do Rick and Sherry know?

27:19.305 --> 27:22.806
No, they just think
I'm a screw-up.

27:22.808 --> 27:26.310
Whatever, it's fine.
We hardly even talk.

27:31.082 --> 27:33.951
Did you get arrested?

27:34.953 --> 27:36.920
Uh-uh.

27:36.922 --> 27:39.089
Thank god.

27:41.026 --> 27:46.063
You know the government
considers us terrorists?

27:46.065 --> 27:48.065
You know what a terrorist is?

27:48.067 --> 27:51.301
It's somebody who
actually does something.

27:51.303 --> 27:52.302
People want to vote for change,

27:52.304 --> 27:55.806
but they don't actually
want to do the changing.

27:55.808 --> 27:56.974
I worked for Peta.

27:56.976 --> 28:01.278
I went to the marches.
Nothing happened.

28:01.280 --> 28:02.379
When I started doing this stuff,

28:02.381 --> 28:04.214
then I could feel
something happening.

28:04.216 --> 28:08.919
I could feel the difference
we were making.

28:08.921 --> 28:13.357
If that makes me a terrorist,
then whatever.

28:17.128 --> 28:20.764
Some people need to be
terrorized sometimes.

28:20.766 --> 28:22.700
<i>The latest jobs report is in</i>

28:22.702 --> 28:25.969
<i>from the labor department,
and it does not look good.</i>

28:25.971 --> 28:28.072
<i>The figures show
that American companies</i>

28:28.074 --> 28:29.206
<i>are laying off employees</i>

28:29.208 --> 28:31.175
<i>at the fastest rate
in five years,</i>

28:31.177 --> 28:35.379
<i>with over 159,000 jobs lost
since September.</i>

28:37.316 --> 28:40.751
Where you been?
Your father and I made dinner.

28:40.753 --> 28:43.821
We had no idea
you'd be home so late.

28:44.489 --> 28:45.923
I ran into Emily Rhoades.

28:45.925 --> 28:48.092
Oh, well, you could've called.

28:48.094 --> 28:52.062
We had no way
of getting in touch with you.

28:52.197 --> 28:54.932
Uh, you haven't had a way
to get in touch with me

28:54.934 --> 28:56.066
for like three years.

28:56.068 --> 28:59.403
Seriously?

29:03.975 --> 29:05.509
I'm sorry.

29:07.445 --> 29:09.813
I'll call next time.

29:09.815 --> 29:13.150
There's some dessert
in the fridge.

29:39.245 --> 29:42.045
Why is this door locked?

29:42.047 --> 29:43.247
I'm getting dressed!

29:43.249 --> 29:48.018
I don't like locked doors
in my house.

29:48.020 --> 29:52.122
I'm putting my clothes on!

29:52.124 --> 29:53.991
Okay, fine.

30:14.547 --> 30:17.481
Are you okay?

30:17.483 --> 30:18.882
Excuse me?

30:20.052 --> 30:23.320
You seem maybe not okay.

30:24.489 --> 30:27.157
I just didn't want you
to miss breakfast.

30:34.332 --> 30:35.465
Scrapple, kiddo?

30:35.467 --> 30:37.000
No, no!

30:37.002 --> 30:38.235
Oops.

30:38.237 --> 30:38.869
No meat.

30:38.871 --> 30:40.470
Mr. bacon greasy fingers!

30:40.472 --> 30:45.475
It's barely meat!
Just eat around it.

30:46.110 --> 30:50.848
So, I am gonna drop Tricia off
at David's farm.

30:50.850 --> 30:54.918
Do you wanna come say hello?
He'd love to see you.

30:54.920 --> 30:55.986
Terri, too.

30:55.988 --> 30:58.222
I, um, I don't think so.

30:58.224 --> 31:02.459
I, um, was hoping Jacob
and I could...

31:07.165 --> 31:09.566
Okay, yeah, sure,
that'd be fine.

31:11.403 --> 31:13.070
Cool.

31:19.310 --> 31:22.179
Take your pick!
Whatever you want!

31:22.181 --> 31:22.946
Hi, uncle David!

31:22.948 --> 31:28.151
Oh, look at you!
Aw! Scrawny little thing.

31:28.153 --> 31:31.655
Don't they feed you
up in New York?

31:31.657 --> 31:32.656
This place looks great!

31:32.658 --> 31:34.224
- Yeah, you like it?
- Mm-hmm.

31:34.226 --> 31:36.627
Terri always wanted
her own little herb farm,

31:36.629 --> 31:38.929
so she's finally got it.

31:38.931 --> 31:39.463
In the meantime,

31:39.465 --> 31:42.132
I'm the one that has
to take care of this place.

31:42.134 --> 31:45.669
But I did get to name the goats!

31:46.605 --> 31:48.906
Shut up, Blanche!

31:48.908 --> 31:50.374
She's my favorite.

31:50.376 --> 31:52.542
Tricia,
why don't you take Colleen

31:52.544 --> 31:53.944
on a little tour of the farm

31:53.946 --> 31:57.948
because David and I have
some business to discuss.

31:57.950 --> 31:59.917
Five minutes, sweet pea.

31:59.919 --> 32:02.419
Okay. Okay.

32:03.421 --> 32:07.124
I think it's great you and Jacob
are still together.

32:07.126 --> 32:09.059
Uh, thanks.

32:09.061 --> 32:12.229
It's, um...

32:12.231 --> 32:14.464
Yeah.

32:14.466 --> 32:17.067
Don't my parents
drive you crazy?

32:17.069 --> 32:19.670
Oh, they're not that bad.

32:19.672 --> 32:22.372
At least they care.

32:23.374 --> 32:26.076
How long you been working here?

32:26.078 --> 32:32.049
Ever since they got the place,
a couple years ago.

32:32.051 --> 32:34.284
And then after your brother
got hurt,

32:34.286 --> 32:37.254
I needed something
to keep me busy.

32:50.068 --> 32:51.668
What's in there?

32:55.040 --> 32:58.709
So, you just water everything
and feed the animals?

32:58.711 --> 32:59.977
All kinds of stuff.

32:59.979 --> 33:03.213
Um, collect the eggs
from the chickens.

33:03.215 --> 33:04.281
Chickens?

33:13.024 --> 33:16.159
Did you know
they were cannibals?

33:16.161 --> 33:16.560
No.

33:16.562 --> 33:20.097
Yeah. The big ones peck
the little ones to death,

33:20.099 --> 33:22.566
and then they eat them.

33:22.568 --> 33:23.200
Wow.

33:23.202 --> 33:25.635
You know, we're just playing

33:25.637 --> 33:26.636
with some ice cream,

33:26.638 --> 33:29.639
waiting for some
hot boys to come by.

33:29.641 --> 33:33.010
We even tried on
some sexy outfits for them, too.

33:36.781 --> 33:38.582
Meow.

33:38.584 --> 33:40.417
Colleen?

33:42.120 --> 33:45.088
Hey, wanna go for a walk?

33:45.090 --> 33:47.424
Not really.

33:48.526 --> 33:50.293
Okay.

33:53.531 --> 33:58.301
<i>It vass a dark and stormy night.</i>

33:58.303 --> 34:03.040
<i>I vant to suck your blood!</i>

34:03.042 --> 34:06.076
<i>Go back
to your grave, Draculina!</i>

34:06.078 --> 34:06.610
<i>Never!</i>

34:06.612 --> 34:09.413
<i>Oh, yeah?
Then take this!</i>

34:09.415 --> 34:11.181
<i>Hey, put that down!
Cut it out!</i>

34:11.183 --> 34:15.685
<i>Where did you get this?
Where did you get this?</i>

34:15.687 --> 34:17.154
<i>I borrowed it from Tyler.</i>

34:17.156 --> 34:20.190
<i>What's the rule in our house?</i>

34:20.192 --> 34:22.458
<i>No guns allowed.</i>

34:32.335 --> 34:36.273
Hey, there, mister man.

34:36.275 --> 34:39.676
Tricia, you don't have to.

34:39.678 --> 34:43.213
Please, let me at least try.

34:51.789 --> 34:55.559
Mmm. My big strong hero.

34:55.561 --> 34:56.626
Tricia.

34:56.628 --> 35:00.197
You are. You are.

35:06.838 --> 35:07.471
Please.

35:07.473 --> 35:11.374
No, I want to see
how much you want me.

35:25.389 --> 35:27.424
I'm trying really hard
right now.

35:27.426 --> 35:30.527
I know, I know.
I appreciate it.

35:32.897 --> 35:35.232
I love you.

35:37.135 --> 35:39.369
I love you, too.

36:20.778 --> 36:23.180
Mom, where's the hair dryer?

36:23.182 --> 36:25.482
In the middle drawer.

36:31.956 --> 36:33.323
Find it okay?

36:33.325 --> 36:34.591
Yep.

37:18.369 --> 37:19.669
Hello?

37:27.612 --> 37:29.012
Have a seat!

37:29.014 --> 37:29.846
Colleen...

37:29.848 --> 37:33.683
Have a seat, please!

39:58.696 --> 40:03.967
Uh, we'll just come back
another time.

40:07.605 --> 40:09.973
See? There's no one out here.

40:22.853 --> 40:24.053
Ready?

40:24.055 --> 40:25.922
Mm-hmm.

40:40.471 --> 40:43.573
How often do our parents
smoke pot?

40:43.575 --> 40:45.775
All the time.

40:45.777 --> 40:46.843
When did that start?

40:46.845 --> 40:48.611
I don't think
it ever really stopped.

40:48.613 --> 40:50.146
Um, maybe they cut back
when we were born,

40:50.148 --> 40:54.050
but ever since you left,
they just totally don't care,

40:54.052 --> 40:59.155
and with all my stuff
and Tricia...

41:00.124 --> 41:02.025
Well, you don't, do you?

41:02.027 --> 41:06.796
Maybe a few times, in Iraq.

41:06.798 --> 41:08.164
Hmm, what was it like?

41:08.166 --> 41:10.033
It was okay.
I mean, it was kinda stupid,

41:10.035 --> 41:15.839
but sometimes you have to
get stupid over there.

41:25.616 --> 41:29.118
So, we do these, um,
field trips, um, across America

41:29.120 --> 41:31.855
to do, like, community service
stuff, you know?

41:31.857 --> 41:32.489
Mm-hmm.

41:32.491 --> 41:33.890
Like, we did a lot
of home rebuilding

41:33.892 --> 41:36.192
in Louisiana and Mississippi,
that sort of thing,

41:36.194 --> 41:38.261
but this one month we went
to Charleston, south Carolina,

41:38.263 --> 41:42.765
and we worked in a group home
for mentally disabled adults,

41:42.767 --> 41:47.203
and I, um, I was assigned
to a woman named Ro-Ro,

41:47.205 --> 41:51.274
and, um, um, she was really
so sweet and very funny.

41:51.276 --> 41:55.812
She insisted on putting
her own makeup on every morning.

41:55.814 --> 41:56.246
Mm-hmm.

41:56.248 --> 42:00.183
And, um, she was a midge...
She was a little person,

42:00.185 --> 42:01.017
and she loved men.

42:01.019 --> 42:03.686
That's all she ever
wanted to talk about,

42:03.688 --> 42:05.121
and she'd just
go on and on about men,

42:05.123 --> 42:08.057
and if I, if I put on the song
<i>achy breaky heart,</i>

42:08.059 --> 42:08.958
she just lost it.

42:08.960 --> 42:10.593
I've never seen someone so happy
in my whole life

42:10.595 --> 42:13.296
than when Ro-Ro would listen
to <i> achy breaky heart,</i>

42:13.298 --> 42:15.198
but one of the nuns,
sister Isadora,

42:15.200 --> 42:16.533
she was assigned
to this patient,

42:16.535 --> 42:19.202
this guy who ate everything,
literally everything.

42:19.204 --> 42:20.103
He, um, had a disorder

42:20.105 --> 42:21.738
where he'd put everything
in his mouth,

42:21.740 --> 42:22.972
so you had to watch him
at all times,

42:22.974 --> 42:24.307
even when he went
into the bathroom,

42:24.309 --> 42:25.875
and so Isadora went
into the bathroom once,

42:25.877 --> 42:30.847
and he sat on the toilet,
and he, um, he's taking a poop.

42:30.849 --> 42:32.549
When he finishes,
after he finishes,

42:32.551 --> 42:34.117
he reaches into the toilet,

42:34.119 --> 42:37.554
and he pulls it out,
and he eats it.

42:37.556 --> 42:39.055
Oh! Oh, man!

42:39.057 --> 42:42.592
Isadora couldn't do anything.

42:42.594 --> 42:46.296
She just puked
all over the floor.

42:46.298 --> 42:50.300
And he walks over,
and he starts eating her puke!

42:53.638 --> 42:54.270
I can't laugh.

42:54.272 --> 42:58.074
Come on! We laughed
our butts off, and we're nuns.

42:58.743 --> 42:59.709
Oh, my gosh, are you okay?

42:59.711 --> 43:06.683
No, I can't laugh.
It's my lungs and the hiking.

43:13.758 --> 43:15.858
You okay?

43:15.860 --> 43:18.261
Yeah.

43:29.039 --> 43:31.274
Are you monsters?

43:36.714 --> 43:40.984
Yeah, we're monsters.

43:45.222 --> 43:53.029
Joan Marie peacock-Lunsford.

43:53.230 --> 43:57.867
I sure could use some company
in this bathtub.

44:00.137 --> 44:05.008
Mr. green and I are gonna get
real lonely without you.

44:05.010 --> 44:08.211
Okay, just a second
before I forget.

44:13.384 --> 44:16.886
Calgon, take me away!

44:42.880 --> 44:48.284
Um, so, there's, um, this,
a little green box

44:48.286 --> 44:49.318
in, in our bathroom.

44:49.320 --> 44:53.990
Do you know
what I'm talking about?

44:53.992 --> 44:54.924
No.

44:54.926 --> 44:56.059
You sure?

44:56.061 --> 44:58.795
Okay.

44:58.797 --> 44:59.829
Oh.

44:59.831 --> 45:00.263
Nice.

45:00.265 --> 45:01.397
How about this one?

45:01.399 --> 45:03.232
I think this one
is just so pretty.

45:03.234 --> 45:04.434
It looks great on you.

45:04.436 --> 45:10.907
Yeah? The neckline's pretty.

45:10.909 --> 45:13.009
I don't know.

45:13.011 --> 45:15.211
Oh, uh, maybe
a little too short.

45:15.213 --> 45:18.181
Let's put the first one back on.
That one looked great!

45:18.183 --> 45:21.350
I'm gonna try it on.
Be right back.

45:23.987 --> 45:25.421
Help?

45:26.190 --> 45:27.790
Hi, there.

45:27.792 --> 45:30.226
Want some help with the zipper?

45:37.968 --> 45:41.104
It's stuck on a flower.

45:41.106 --> 45:46.843
Colleen, do you believe in god?

45:47.778 --> 45:49.212
Mm-hmm.

45:52.816 --> 45:53.750
When I was little girl,

45:53.752 --> 45:58.020
I used to watch out the back
of my trailer every night

45:58.022 --> 46:01.457
and look at the cars
turn their lights off.

46:03.894 --> 46:07.930
And then I would say,
"good night, cars,"

46:07.932 --> 46:12.168
like everything in the world
had a heart and a soul.

46:13.971 --> 46:17.006
But that isn't true, is it?

46:22.212 --> 46:27.083
I've been trying so hard
to be happy.

46:27.085 --> 46:31.420
Everybody's had such a bad time.

46:31.422 --> 46:35.258
But I don't want to be on TV.

46:42.833 --> 46:43.366
Tricia, I...

46:43.368 --> 46:47.036
I'm stuck here,
and I don't know what to do.

47:05.489 --> 47:09.892
Mother, you have a phone call.

47:09.894 --> 47:10.393
Who is it?

47:10.395 --> 47:12.361
I'll give you three guesses.

47:12.363 --> 47:16.899
I'm just not quite ready
to come back yet.

47:16.901 --> 47:20.269
Well, I just wish
you would've told me sooner.

47:20.271 --> 47:23.172
Adelaide and Bernadette are
supposed to take some orphans

47:23.174 --> 47:24.607
to six flags tomorrow.

47:24.609 --> 47:27.577
I know. I'm sorry.

47:28.412 --> 47:31.080
Just a couple more days.

47:35.953 --> 47:37.086
I hate this.

47:37.088 --> 47:43.125
Hey!
What's the matter? Chicken?

47:44.928 --> 47:47.096
Fried chicken?

47:48.866 --> 47:50.566
Give me your hands.

47:50.568 --> 47:51.167
Why?

47:51.169 --> 47:54.237
Jeez Louise,
just give me your hands.

48:08.385 --> 48:10.353
Are we praying?

48:13.957 --> 48:16.058
Something like that.

48:22.532 --> 48:24.901
See, this isn't so bad.

48:24.903 --> 48:26.502
People are looking.

48:26.504 --> 48:27.270
Let them look.

48:27.272 --> 48:30.573
You've got nothing
to be ashamed of.

48:34.578 --> 48:35.678
Excuse me, ma'am?

48:35.680 --> 48:36.946
Yes, ma'am?

48:36.948 --> 48:38.214
Do you guys sell yarn?

48:38.216 --> 48:41.083
Um, yes, aisle four.

48:41.085 --> 48:42.318
Thank you.

48:42.320 --> 48:43.019
Excuse me.

48:43.021 --> 48:45.655
Aren't you the young man
I read about in the newspaper,

48:45.657 --> 48:47.323
the one burnt in the war?

48:47.325 --> 48:49.992
Uh, yeah, that's me.

48:49.994 --> 48:50.660
Son, I want you to know

48:50.662 --> 48:54.196
everyone here
thinks of you as a real hero,

48:54.198 --> 48:56.499
and I just,
I just think it's a shame

48:56.501 --> 48:59.502
you boys were wasted
on this stupid war.

48:59.504 --> 49:01.537
So many wasted young lives.

49:01.539 --> 49:03.706
Bet you thank
your lucky stars for Obama.

49:03.708 --> 49:05.541
<i>Wave of murder which is sweeping</i>

49:05.543 --> 49:09.512
<i>the eastern third of the nation
is being committed by creatures</i>

49:09.514 --> 49:14.283
<i>who feast upon
the flesh of their victims.</i>

49:14.285 --> 49:17.186
Hey, can I ask you something?

49:17.188 --> 49:20.089
Mm-hmm.

49:20.091 --> 49:21.390
When the bomb went off in Iraq,

49:21.392 --> 49:25.528
did you think
you were gonna die?

49:25.530 --> 49:28.731
Yeah, I knew I was going to die.

49:32.235 --> 49:34.503
What was it like?

49:34.505 --> 49:35.438
You know how they say

49:35.440 --> 49:38.507
that everything flashes
before your eyes?

49:38.509 --> 49:41.377
Yeah, that doesn't happen.

49:41.379 --> 49:42.244
But, I was, like,

49:42.246 --> 49:45.214
suddenly totally okay
with my entire life,

49:45.216 --> 49:47.350
and I sort of thought,
"I guess that's it,"

49:47.352 --> 49:52.288
but there's no regrets
or anything.

49:52.290 --> 49:57.760
You know who would like to hear
that story, I bet?

49:57.762 --> 49:59.628
Millions of Americans.

49:59.630 --> 50:04.400
Oh, mom told you about CNN?

50:04.402 --> 50:05.267
Uh-huh.

50:05.269 --> 50:09.438
I don't want to be
anybody's hero, Colleen.

50:12.576 --> 50:16.612
But, you kind of are.

50:18.148 --> 50:20.149
It's such a joke.

50:20.151 --> 50:24.754
I didn't die.
That doesn't make me special.

50:24.756 --> 50:28.591
I just feel like a freak

50:28.593 --> 50:30.693
and a loser.

50:44.541 --> 50:46.575
Welcome to the club.

51:05.495 --> 51:08.798
You guys going to watch
the debates tonight?

51:08.800 --> 51:11.534
Probably not.

51:11.536 --> 51:16.705
Sweet potato, you of all people.

51:16.707 --> 51:18.374
Mom.

51:18.376 --> 51:22.445
Why don't we just rent a movie
or something?

51:22.447 --> 51:25.347
I'll see you later, sister.

51:26.383 --> 51:29.385
I'll be there in a minute,
brother.

51:36.227 --> 51:41.831
Just can't seem to do
anything right.

51:44.401 --> 51:47.236
Well, it's tough, mom.

51:51.842 --> 51:56.112
Don't you care about the issues?

51:56.814 --> 52:00.583
Do you ever think about
anything bigger than yourself?

52:01.886 --> 52:05.521
Um, seriously?

52:05.523 --> 52:08.624
That's not what I meant.

52:08.626 --> 52:10.326
What did you mean?

52:13.530 --> 52:19.435
Your dad and I
love you both so much.

52:20.403 --> 52:27.243
And, sweet pea,
I know you took our pot.

52:27.245 --> 52:29.445
And it's totally cool.

52:29.447 --> 52:31.647
You're young.
You want to experiment.

52:31.649 --> 52:34.783
We understand.
This is a natural part of life.

52:34.785 --> 52:39.455
And you know what?
Dad and I are happy to share.

52:39.457 --> 52:43.225
What's ours is yours.

52:48.598 --> 52:50.833
I flushed your drugs, mom.

52:50.835 --> 52:51.901
Excuse me?

52:51.903 --> 52:58.841
Don't you think you're taking
enough drugs already?

52:58.843 --> 53:00.476
What did I do?

53:00.478 --> 53:02.678
Do you really want me
to answer that?

53:02.680 --> 53:05.281
Yes, yes, I do.

53:05.283 --> 53:08.784
You're gonna have to put
the knife away.

53:14.825 --> 53:21.430
I must be a terrible
disappointment to you,

53:21.432 --> 53:25.634
but that's the way it is,
isn't it?

53:25.636 --> 53:30.940
And you know what?
That's life.

53:30.942 --> 53:33.542
I'm a disappointment to you,

53:33.544 --> 53:39.848
and you are
a disappointment to me.

53:40.617 --> 53:43.752
I just wish
you'd grow up a little

53:43.754 --> 53:45.254
and get over it already.

53:50.861 --> 53:52.761
Really, mom?

53:53.997 --> 53:56.732
Maybe you'd understand
if you stuck around

53:56.734 --> 54:01.937
and dealt with your problems
for once in your life.

54:01.939 --> 54:03.672
Mother...

54:03.674 --> 54:07.776
I will try to correct
myself with the grace of god.

54:30.901 --> 54:32.401
Oh, hey, Colleen.

54:32.403 --> 54:34.803
Hey, sorry I didn't call.

54:34.805 --> 54:38.774
Yeah, no, please,
don't worry about it.

54:38.776 --> 54:40.743
Remember this guy?

54:40.745 --> 54:43.612
Hey, Emily.

54:43.614 --> 54:46.548
Oh, hey, Jacob.

55:05.703 --> 55:08.304
Thank you so much!

55:08.306 --> 55:12.408
Terri and I would never have
been able to sustain

55:12.410 --> 55:15.878
so many wonderful years
of marriage

55:15.880 --> 55:19.315
if it weren't
for our spectacular friends!

55:19.317 --> 55:20.015
Seriously, y'all.

55:20.017 --> 55:22.951
You've let our funky
little family into your hearts,

55:22.953 --> 55:26.822
and that has made
all the difference.

55:26.824 --> 55:28.324
Now, let's party!

55:44.040 --> 55:45.841
Really?

55:45.843 --> 55:47.076
We're jealous of you.

55:47.078 --> 55:48.677
No, don't be.

55:48.679 --> 55:51.714
Adoption really was the best
thing that ever happened to us.

55:51.716 --> 55:55.451
And really, no parent knows
what they're going to get.

55:55.453 --> 55:56.752
Even if they're
not your real children,

55:56.754 --> 56:00.656
you really see yourself in them
as they get older.

56:00.658 --> 56:02.057
And when they were younger,

56:02.059 --> 56:04.360
they were always
at each other's throats,

56:04.362 --> 56:07.629
but now, now they're like
two peas in a pod.

56:07.631 --> 56:09.932
They are so smart,
and they are so sweet.

56:09.934 --> 56:13.469
And Troy, he loves
his little sister so much.

56:13.471 --> 56:16.038
And we, we are truly lucky.

56:16.040 --> 56:17.740
Mm-hmm.

56:17.742 --> 56:21.377
And it seems like yesterday
they were little puppies

56:21.379 --> 56:23.979
chasing squirrels
in the backyard.

56:23.981 --> 56:25.013
Yeah.

56:25.015 --> 56:27.483
That's so great, you two.

56:27.485 --> 56:30.052
So, how's Chiclet?

56:30.054 --> 56:32.087
Chiclet!

56:32.089 --> 56:35.691
Chiclet... Is wonderful.

56:35.693 --> 56:40.095
We cannot allow
Iran to get a nuclear weapon.

56:40.097 --> 56:43.031
Not only would it
threaten Israel,

56:43.033 --> 56:44.967
our strongest ally in the region

56:44.969 --> 56:47.736
and one of our strongest allies
in the world,

56:47.738 --> 56:50.639
but it would also
create a possibility

56:50.641 --> 56:54.910
of nuclear weapons falling
into the hands of terrorists.

57:09.459 --> 57:11.059
<i>It's a nurse.</i>

57:11.061 --> 57:13.429
<i>Do you like it?</i>

57:13.431 --> 57:16.098
<i>I thought you said
you wanted to be a doctor</i>

57:16.100 --> 57:18.634
<i>when you grew up.</i>

57:18.636 --> 57:21.970
<i>Then what do you want to be?</i>

57:21.972 --> 57:25.841
<i>I don't know.</i>

57:25.843 --> 57:27.676
<i>A scientist?</i>

57:27.678 --> 57:28.777
<i>No.</i>

57:28.779 --> 57:30.646
<i>An artist?</i>

57:31.981 --> 57:36.151
<i>You can be anything
you want to be, sweet pea.</i>

57:36.153 --> 57:37.186
Okay, well, in honor

57:37.188 --> 57:39.488
of this three-year
high-school reunion,

57:39.490 --> 57:43.158
I vote that we play
truth or dare!

57:43.160 --> 57:45.627
Uh, or not.

57:45.629 --> 57:46.995
Come on, brother.

57:46.997 --> 57:48.797
I'll play!

57:48.799 --> 57:50.466
Okay.

57:50.468 --> 57:52.534
I choose truth.

57:52.536 --> 57:52.935
Hmm.

57:52.937 --> 57:57.072
What's the worst thing
you know about your parents?

57:57.074 --> 57:58.106
Both of them?

57:58.108 --> 57:59.775
Either one.

58:02.245 --> 58:05.981
Oh. Oh, jeez...

58:05.983 --> 58:07.783
Do I tell this story?

58:07.785 --> 58:09.218
Yes, tell it!

58:09.220 --> 58:09.852
Tell it.

58:09.854 --> 58:14.790
Okay, okay, but you have to chug
a beer with me,

58:14.792 --> 58:16.725
both of you.

58:16.727 --> 58:18.827
Double dare.

58:18.829 --> 58:20.128
Wow.

58:20.130 --> 58:22.598
That's my very first beer.

58:22.600 --> 58:23.565
Your first beer.

58:23.567 --> 58:27.870
I mean, it is Heineken,
so it's barely beer.

58:30.608 --> 58:32.641
Okay.

58:32.643 --> 58:35.711
Yes!

58:38.749 --> 58:40.048
Milady.

58:41.719 --> 58:44.987
Sir. Let's do it.

58:44.989 --> 58:46.722
Well, no, wait.
Hold on. First...

58:46.724 --> 58:47.890
Okay, I'll do it. I'll do it.

58:47.892 --> 58:50.025
But first you have to tell
the story first.

58:50.027 --> 58:51.126
That's the deal.

58:51.128 --> 58:54.196
What? Yikes! Uh!

58:54.198 --> 58:54.863
Okay!

58:54.865 --> 59:01.570
Okay, so, you guys remember
Askjeeves. Com, the website?

59:01.572 --> 59:02.838
Mm-hmm.

59:02.840 --> 59:07.042
Okay, when I was 12,

59:07.044 --> 59:10.279
I wanted to look up something
on the Internet,

59:10.281 --> 59:13.549
and I had to go upstairs
to my parents' bedroom,

59:13.551 --> 59:16.818
and my dad had stayed logged in
to his account,

59:16.820 --> 59:22.658
and so I go on to Askjeeves,
and I'm typing my question,

59:22.660 --> 59:24.860
and, like,
when you type your question,

59:24.862 --> 59:28.730
then the last five things
that you've asked it come up,

59:28.732 --> 59:33.135
and apparently,
my dad had asked it,

59:33.137 --> 59:36.138
"where, near Asheville,
north Carolina,

59:36.140 --> 59:40.108
can I find a BBW prostitute?"

59:40.110 --> 59:42.644
Whew!

59:42.646 --> 59:44.313
What's BBW?

59:44.315 --> 59:50.619
It is big, beautiful women.

59:50.621 --> 59:52.921
He asked Jeeves that?

01:00:02.231 --> 01:00:03.832
To parents!

01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:07.169
To parents.

01:00:07.171 --> 01:00:10.005
Okay, first is the candidacy.

01:00:10.007 --> 01:00:11.006
No, wait. Hold on. No, wait.

01:00:11.008 --> 01:00:12.975
First it's the applicancy,
and then,

01:00:12.977 --> 01:00:17.646
and then it's
the candidatcy... candidacy.

01:00:17.648 --> 01:00:19.982
Um, and then the novitiate.

01:00:19.984 --> 01:00:22.084
I'm the novitiate.
That's me.

01:00:22.086 --> 01:00:25.053
But then you do permanent.
First, no, hold on.

01:00:25.055 --> 01:00:28.924
The temporary vows,
and then it is the final vows,

01:00:28.926 --> 01:00:32.894
and then you are a nun
forever and ever.

01:00:32.896 --> 01:00:34.029
Did I get it?

01:00:34.031 --> 01:00:35.764
Oh, my god.

01:00:35.766 --> 01:00:40.769
Ooh, you are wasted.

01:00:40.771 --> 01:00:43.805
How many of those have I had?

01:00:43.807 --> 01:00:45.641
Two and a half.

01:00:58.855 --> 01:01:02.691
Last one.
You wanna split it?

01:01:02.693 --> 01:01:03.992
Sure.

01:01:11.801 --> 01:01:13.969
Is your mom doing okay?

01:01:13.971 --> 01:01:17.039
Mmm, who knows?

01:01:17.041 --> 01:01:17.839
Not really.

01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:20.242
She was acting happy
for a little while,

01:01:20.244 --> 01:01:23.679
but it's tough.

01:01:23.681 --> 01:01:26.281
Jeez, yeah.

01:01:26.283 --> 01:01:32.821
If my kid ran away
after I tried to off myself...

01:01:32.823 --> 01:01:33.455
Sorry.

01:01:33.457 --> 01:01:35.357
No, it's okay.

01:01:40.764 --> 01:01:44.299
Can you see anything
behind those things?

01:01:44.301 --> 01:01:46.835
Barely, but yeah.

01:01:46.837 --> 01:01:50.372
Why don't you take them off?
It's nighttime, anyway.

01:01:50.374 --> 01:01:53.141
Yeah, I'd rather not.

01:01:53.143 --> 01:01:56.044
I dare you to take them off.

01:01:56.046 --> 01:01:58.947
You don't wanna see it.
It's not...

01:01:58.949 --> 01:02:02.851
Maybe I do.

01:02:02.853 --> 01:02:09.391
Look, your spit
has touched my mouth.

01:02:09.393 --> 01:02:10.092
Mm-hmm.

01:02:10.094 --> 01:02:12.327
I think we know
each other well enough, huh?

01:02:12.329 --> 01:02:16.064
That's true, yeah.
I can't.

01:02:25.842 --> 01:02:32.981
In high school, I wanted
to make out with you so hard.

01:03:38.414 --> 01:03:42.083
Now, this little number
we're very, very happy with.

01:03:42.085 --> 01:03:47.455
It's mellow but lasts longer.
Perfect for the over-40 crowd.

01:03:47.457 --> 01:03:53.195
And, uh, do you have anything
a little stronger?

01:03:53.197 --> 01:03:56.598
That... Would be these guys.

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:57.265
Oh.

01:03:57.267 --> 01:03:59.134
Terri's little babies.

01:03:59.136 --> 01:04:02.237
Mushrooms covered
in Mexican chocolate.

01:04:02.239 --> 01:04:05.473
They'll really take you
south of the border.

01:04:05.475 --> 01:04:06.975
Lover, you ready?

01:04:06.977 --> 01:04:11.580
Yeah, yeah, just a second.
I'll meet you at the car, honey.

01:04:15.885 --> 01:04:17.152
I threw up!

01:04:24.393 --> 01:04:26.962
Hello?

01:04:26.964 --> 01:04:28.430
Guys?

01:04:31.534 --> 01:04:35.136
Do you want to roast
some pumpkin seeds?

01:04:57.326 --> 01:04:58.560
Hello?

01:05:05.635 --> 01:05:07.202
Guys?

01:06:31.053 --> 01:06:32.587
Um...

01:06:32.589 --> 01:06:36.024
I made a salad for lunch.

01:06:36.026 --> 01:06:38.593
Do you want some?

01:06:38.595 --> 01:06:40.595
Yeah, that'd be nice.

01:06:42.098 --> 01:06:45.133
When do you have to go back?
Tomorrow?

01:06:45.135 --> 01:06:50.238
Um, I was thinking
about leaving today actually.

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:52.374
Oh.

01:06:52.376 --> 01:06:58.413
Do you think you could stay
maybe one more night?

01:06:58.415 --> 01:07:00.682
I have a fun idea.

01:07:03.152 --> 01:07:04.686
How fun?

01:07:08.424 --> 01:07:10.258
Fun.

01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:15.096
Sister Joan of arc,
I try to make it a habit

01:07:15.098 --> 01:07:17.665
to raise my voice
only when necessary,

01:07:17.667 --> 01:07:19.100
and it is not often

01:07:19.102 --> 01:07:21.302
that the occasion
calls for me to raise my voice,

01:07:21.304 --> 01:07:25.106
but you are trying my Patience,
and on top of that,

01:07:25.108 --> 01:07:27.108
you are still in possession
of my car,

01:07:27.110 --> 01:07:29.411
a car which is needed
up here in New York,

01:07:29.413 --> 01:07:30.612
in case you forgot.

01:07:36.453 --> 01:07:40.355
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.

01:07:40.357 --> 01:07:41.623
She hung up.

01:07:41.625 --> 01:07:45.794
And one, two, three, four.
Uh-huh.

01:07:47.631 --> 01:07:49.364
Uh-huh. That's it.

01:07:49.366 --> 01:07:51.566
Okay, come on. Oh, yes!

01:07:51.568 --> 01:07:54.169
Oh, yes. Here we go.

01:07:54.171 --> 01:07:56.104
And one, two, three, four!

01:07:56.106 --> 01:07:59.841
Happy family Halloween party!

01:07:59.843 --> 01:08:01.443
Whoo!

01:08:14.423 --> 01:08:16.758
Thank you.

01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:28.536
Awesome.

01:08:34.376 --> 01:08:35.510
Bring our family together

01:08:35.511 --> 01:08:38.345
for this festive
Halloween night,

01:08:38.348 --> 01:08:44.219
and for... For this food
that we are about to receive.

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:46.220
Amen.

01:08:46.223 --> 01:08:47.421
Let's eat.

01:09:04.273 --> 01:09:06.508
This is awesome,

01:09:06.510 --> 01:09:09.844
awesomely done,
I just want to say.

01:09:19.921 --> 01:09:21.256
Good.

01:09:37.473 --> 01:09:39.274
Just touch it.

01:10:04.366 --> 01:10:05.400
Colleen!

01:10:05.402 --> 01:10:06.834
Ah ha ha!

01:10:13.742 --> 01:10:16.544
Sweet pea.

01:10:16.546 --> 01:10:19.514
Everybody having a good time?

01:10:32.795 --> 01:10:35.363
Anyone else for seconds?

01:10:35.365 --> 01:10:37.665
Um, sweet pea?

01:10:37.667 --> 01:10:41.803
It's her last night.
Let her indulge.

01:10:41.805 --> 01:10:44.672
You wanna split one?

01:10:44.674 --> 01:10:45.907
Sure!

01:10:45.909 --> 01:10:49.010
Don't mind if I do.

01:11:03.325 --> 01:11:08.296
Mom, how much wine
did you put in that pasta?

01:11:08.298 --> 01:11:11.566
Oh, not a lot.

01:11:11.568 --> 01:11:12.734
I am such a lightweight.

01:11:12.736 --> 01:11:16.271
Wait, doesn't the heat
cook out all the alcohol?

01:11:16.273 --> 01:11:21.843
Yeah, you're right.
My fingers are a little tingly.

01:11:24.313 --> 01:11:30.752
What did you put
in the cupcakes, mom?

01:11:30.754 --> 01:11:31.386
Mom?

01:11:31.388 --> 01:11:34.956
Colleen, it's your last night.

01:11:34.958 --> 01:11:40.428
I just wanted us to all relax
and have fun, you know,

01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:41.696
like a family.

01:11:41.698 --> 01:11:42.997
Why would you...

01:11:42.999 --> 01:11:46.301
What is wrong with you?

01:12:01.017 --> 01:12:02.017
Sweet pea!

01:12:04.888 --> 01:12:08.890
Sweet pea, please open up!

01:12:08.892 --> 01:12:11.926
Colleen Noel Lunsford,
this isn't funny!

01:12:29.845 --> 01:12:33.348
You knew about the key
under the gargoyle?

01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:37.919
I always knew
about the gargoyle key.

01:12:45.094 --> 01:12:48.963
So, is it okay if I sit down?

01:12:48.965 --> 01:12:50.465
Fine.

01:13:12.955 --> 01:13:14.856
Am I a bad mom?

01:13:16.859 --> 01:13:21.396
That's not a fair question.

01:13:21.398 --> 01:13:24.098
Was I a bad mom?

01:13:29.405 --> 01:13:33.608
I guess it's not your fault.

01:13:33.610 --> 01:13:37.178
It was just a lot.

01:13:38.113 --> 01:13:43.618
First Jacob, then you.

01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:48.556
I just, I just needed...

01:13:48.558 --> 01:13:50.491
Structure.

01:13:53.929 --> 01:13:55.863
I'm sorry.

01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:04.639
Yeah, me, too.

01:14:11.513 --> 01:14:15.483
Do you like being a nun?

01:14:15.485 --> 01:14:19.053
Yeah, I do.

01:14:20.189 --> 01:14:24.725
Do you ever wish
you could have a boyfriend?

01:14:27.529 --> 01:14:28.996
Girlfriend?

01:14:28.998 --> 01:14:33.000
I don't think I'll ever want
to do that with anyone.

01:14:34.169 --> 01:14:40.708
Hmm. When you were growing up,
your dad and I used to think

01:14:40.710 --> 01:14:45.880
you'd become a lesbian satanist.

01:14:53.121 --> 01:14:56.891
Sometimes I think
you're sad I'm not.

01:15:03.131 --> 01:15:05.867
Colleen, when I was your age,

01:15:05.869 --> 01:15:10.838
I thought having a kid
would make me an adult,

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:14.909
that it was going to give me
some kind of purpose,

01:15:14.911 --> 01:15:17.612
some sense of direction,

01:15:17.614 --> 01:15:24.018
but, um, it didn't, not really.

01:15:27.756 --> 01:15:32.226
And neither did
having another one.

01:15:32.228 --> 01:15:34.228
And, um, I got older,

01:15:34.230 --> 01:15:38.099
and there was
more and more responsibility,

01:15:38.101 --> 01:15:39.767
and then
that just never went away,

01:15:39.769 --> 01:15:45.273
and it got harder
and harder, and...

01:15:45.275 --> 01:15:47.642
And, um...

01:15:47.644 --> 01:15:53.314
I found myself
becoming very sad.

01:15:55.083 --> 01:15:58.286
And when I was at my saddest,

01:15:58.288 --> 01:16:05.760
I just wanted to go to sleep
and not wake up,

01:16:05.762 --> 01:16:08.629
just sleep.

01:16:08.631 --> 01:16:10.298
And that didn't happen either.

01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:11.332
No matter how hard I tried,

01:16:11.334 --> 01:16:17.772
I just kept waking up
and waking up and waking up.

01:16:19.341 --> 01:16:22.810
And then I tried
something different.

01:16:25.881 --> 01:16:28.883
I didn't get that moment,
Colleen,

01:16:28.885 --> 01:16:31.352
where everything
was just suddenly okay.

01:16:31.354 --> 01:16:36.257
I don't think
those moments exist.

01:16:36.259 --> 01:16:42.196
I think all you can do
is keep trying

01:16:42.198 --> 01:16:49.670
and hope that somehow trying
can be good enough.

01:16:56.179 --> 01:16:58.813
It's good to talk, right?

01:17:02.884 --> 01:17:05.319
Can we be friends?

01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:12.026
Yeah, mom, we can be friends.

01:17:17.265 --> 01:17:19.033
Is it always this fun
to be stoned?

01:17:19.035 --> 01:17:23.270
<i>You're expecting a mere handsaw</i>

01:17:23.272 --> 01:17:26.907
<i>and a covered wooden casket?</i>

01:17:26.909 --> 01:17:30.945
<i>Oh, no.
That's the old-fashioned way</i>

01:17:30.947 --> 01:17:33.714
<i>of sawing people in half.</i>

01:17:33.716 --> 01:17:38.119
<i>Today, magicians
are mechanized tools,</i>

01:17:38.121 --> 01:17:46.121
<i>and nothing will be concealed
from your view!</i>

01:17:56.673 --> 01:17:58.172
Ew!

01:18:05.881 --> 01:18:11.385
Oh, this isn't scary.
It's just horrible.

01:18:16.892 --> 01:18:18.192
Aah!

01:18:19.929 --> 01:18:22.730
They're coming to get you,
Barbara!

01:18:22.732 --> 01:18:23.732
Stop it.

01:18:25.435 --> 01:18:26.435
Shh!

01:18:34.943 --> 01:18:36.444
What do we do?

01:18:36.446 --> 01:18:38.245
What do we do?

01:18:38.247 --> 01:18:39.413
Answer it.

01:18:39.415 --> 01:18:40.414
What if it's the cops?

01:18:40.416 --> 01:18:41.949
How could it possibly
be the cops?

01:18:41.951 --> 01:18:43.851
How could it
possibly not be the cops?

01:18:43.853 --> 01:18:46.353
If it's not the cops,
then who is it?

01:18:49.325 --> 01:18:55.763
Okay, rock-paper-scissors
for who answers the door.

01:18:55.765 --> 01:18:57.998
One, two, three.

01:19:13.249 --> 01:19:15.316
Ah! Jacob!

01:19:17.219 --> 01:19:18.419
Mom, dad, wake up!

01:19:18.421 --> 01:19:21.055
Animal liberations
has taken Jacob!

01:19:25.762 --> 01:19:27.094
Close the door!

01:19:30.433 --> 01:19:33.000
I'll get my keys.

01:19:33.002 --> 01:19:34.502
Come on!

01:19:36.037 --> 01:19:37.438
Oh, my gosh, Tricia.
I'm so sorry.

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:38.339
This is all my fault.

01:19:38.341 --> 01:19:39.540
None of this would have
happened if i...

01:19:39.542 --> 01:19:41.041
I shouldn't have come home.

01:19:41.043 --> 01:19:42.043
Honk at them!

01:19:43.079 --> 01:19:43.811
Honk louder!

01:19:43.813 --> 01:19:45.212
I can't drive and honk
at the same time!

01:19:45.214 --> 01:19:46.480
Hurry up!
They're getting away!

01:19:46.482 --> 01:19:48.215
Oh, god! What do you think
they're gonna do to him?

01:19:48.217 --> 01:19:49.216
I'm trying! I'm trying!

01:19:49.218 --> 01:19:51.152
I didn't want him to go away.
I'm sorry for everything

01:19:51.154 --> 01:19:53.420
I've ever said or done
that's bad ever.

01:19:53.422 --> 01:19:54.355
Tricia, it's okay.

01:19:54.357 --> 01:19:56.991
Everybody in the whole world
thinks bad things sometimes.

01:19:56.993 --> 01:19:59.093
It's gonna be okay.

01:19:59.095 --> 01:20:01.362
Oh, no. That is not good.

01:20:01.364 --> 01:20:02.263
What?

01:20:02.265 --> 01:20:04.231
Uh, nothing.

01:20:09.372 --> 01:20:13.440
Some people need
to be terrorized sometimes.

01:20:13.442 --> 01:20:14.575
Watch out! Watch out!

01:20:14.577 --> 01:20:16.210
Watch out!

01:20:17.046 --> 01:20:22.082
"Oh, Sally,
you left me down the stairs.

01:20:22.084 --> 01:20:24.318
I'm coming up them!"

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:29.023
And then a few hours later,
the doll said again,

01:20:29.025 --> 01:20:33.060
"Sally, I'm in your room!"

01:20:33.062 --> 01:20:35.162
Sally got really, really scared.

01:20:35.164 --> 01:20:36.063
She pulled the covers up

01:20:36.065 --> 01:20:38.899
and, and put a pillow
on her face.

01:20:38.901 --> 01:20:42.570
Then, then the doll said again,

01:20:42.572 --> 01:20:45.472
"oh, Sally,
I'm right next to you!"

01:20:45.474 --> 01:20:48.108
Then the light
turned on suddenly,

01:20:48.110 --> 01:20:51.111
and she saw the doll,
and the doll killed her,

01:20:51.113 --> 01:20:56.083
and every single time
the doll kills a person,

01:20:56.085 --> 01:20:57.184
she puts up one finger,

01:20:57.186 --> 01:21:01.355
and if she runs out of fingers,
she grows more.

01:21:01.357 --> 01:21:06.627
And no one knows
where the doll is now.

01:21:10.099 --> 01:21:11.899
Tricia.

01:21:11.901 --> 01:21:13.934
Yeah, Colleen?

01:21:13.936 --> 01:21:15.402
Are you alive?

01:21:15.404 --> 01:21:17.538
I think so.

01:21:23.912 --> 01:21:26.447
Let's get out of the car.

01:21:26.449 --> 01:21:27.147
Okay.

01:21:27.149 --> 01:21:30.050
Soldier! Soldier! Soldier!

01:21:30.052 --> 01:21:32.653
Soldier! Soldier! Soldier!

01:21:32.655 --> 01:21:35.456
Soldier! Soldier!
Soldier!

01:21:35.458 --> 01:21:37.324
Soldier! Soldier! Soldier!

01:21:37.326 --> 01:21:39.927
Soldier! Soldier!
Soldier!

01:21:43.466 --> 01:21:45.232
Shoot, dog, we missed your ass!

01:21:45.234 --> 01:21:46.934
Didn't mean
to snatch you up like that

01:21:46.936 --> 01:21:51.639
but f-u-n doesn't
take n-o for an answer!

01:21:51.641 --> 01:21:52.506
Whoo!

01:21:52.508 --> 01:21:57.978
And we got you a little
welcome back surprise, soldier!

01:21:57.980 --> 01:22:00.014
Whoo!

01:22:00.016 --> 01:22:02.316
There we go!

01:22:06.322 --> 01:22:09.957
Welcome home, corporal Lunsford!

01:22:09.959 --> 01:22:14.962
Whoo!

01:22:23.371 --> 01:22:25.372
Yeah, baby, shake that.

01:22:28.044 --> 01:22:29.109
Jacob!

01:22:35.117 --> 01:22:36.650
No!

01:22:36.652 --> 01:22:37.584
Jacob!

01:22:37.586 --> 01:22:39.219
No, Jacob!

01:22:39.221 --> 01:22:40.721
Are you okay?

01:22:40.723 --> 01:22:43.057
What?

01:22:43.059 --> 01:22:44.191
Jacob?

01:22:44.193 --> 01:22:47.294
Call an ambulance!
He can't breathe!

01:23:02.677 --> 01:23:04.178
Thanks.

01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:08.315
Sure thing, sugar pie.

01:23:18.526 --> 01:23:22.997
Can I ask you a weird question?

01:23:22.999 --> 01:23:25.566
Ask away, angel.

01:23:25.568 --> 01:23:29.036
Do your parents
know what you do?

01:23:32.107 --> 01:23:34.074
Sure do.

01:23:34.076 --> 01:23:39.113
Can't say they're
happy about it, but...

01:23:39.115 --> 01:23:42.483
We all gotta pay
our bills, right?

01:23:42.485 --> 01:23:44.485
Yeah.

01:23:46.087 --> 01:23:49.623
Plus, I know
they can't talk, anyway.

01:23:49.625 --> 01:23:53.027
We're all screw-ups.

01:23:53.029 --> 01:23:56.030
I guess that's why
we love each other.

01:23:56.032 --> 01:23:58.399
He's in stable condition.

01:23:58.401 --> 01:23:59.400
He's going to be okay,

01:23:59.402 --> 01:24:01.535
but we'll need to keep him
for a week or so

01:24:01.537 --> 01:24:02.603
to monitor him.

01:24:02.605 --> 01:24:05.272
Thank you so much.
We really appreciate it.

01:24:05.274 --> 01:24:08.108
He's a real hero
for pulling through this one.

01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:12.212
We'll be sure
to tell him you said that.

01:24:13.348 --> 01:24:14.715
Thanks.

01:24:16.352 --> 01:24:20.721
Okay, we'll take it from here.
Thank you so much.

01:24:20.723 --> 01:24:22.389
All right.

01:24:23.658 --> 01:24:26.060
Bless y'all.

01:24:26.062 --> 01:24:28.796
Call me if you need anything?

01:24:36.071 --> 01:24:37.571
Okay.

01:24:39.474 --> 01:24:41.341
All good.

01:24:48.817 --> 01:24:51.185
I'm sorry, dad.

01:24:54.589 --> 01:24:57.424
It's gonna be okay, sweet pea.

01:25:07.168 --> 01:25:10.604
I'm gonna miss you guys a lot.

01:25:11.706 --> 01:25:15.375
You can come visit us anytime.

01:25:16.778 --> 01:25:18.545
You, too.

01:25:24.586 --> 01:25:26.720
It's been a long time coming,

01:25:26.722 --> 01:25:31.225
but tonight, because
of what we did on this day,

01:25:31.227 --> 01:25:35.596
in this election,
at this defining moment,

01:25:35.598 --> 01:25:37.831
change has come to America!

01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:52.813
What do you ask
of this community?

01:25:52.815 --> 01:25:57.184
I ask to be
a fully incorporated member.

01:25:59.521 --> 01:26:01.855
God of mercy and compassion,

01:26:01.857 --> 01:26:05.926
I celebrate your faithfulness
and love for me,

01:26:05.928 --> 01:26:07.928
and I praise your name.

01:26:07.930 --> 01:26:11.365
In Thanksgiving
for this gift of my vocation,

01:26:11.367 --> 01:26:18.338
I vow to live a life of poverty,
chastity, and obedience,

01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:22.876
and to persevere
in this community until death.

01:27:07.488 --> 01:27:12.492
Lord, bless these rings
which we bless in your name.

01:27:12.494 --> 01:27:13.694
Grant that those who wear them

01:27:13.696 --> 01:27:17.364
may always have a deep faith
in each other.

01:27:17.366 --> 01:27:20.867
May they do your will
and always live together

01:27:20.869 --> 01:27:24.238
in peace, goodwill, and love.

01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:28.375
We ask this
through Christ, our lord.

01:27:30.945 --> 01:27:34.248
With this ring,

01:27:34.250 --> 01:27:37.317
I make you my wife.

01:27:37.319 --> 01:27:43.423
And with this ring,
I make you my husband.

01:27:47.929 --> 01:27:48.929
All right!
