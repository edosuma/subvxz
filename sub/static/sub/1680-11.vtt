00:00.440 --> 00:02.440
Oh, my god!

00:02.510 --> 00:03.850
I have a tattoo.

00:03.910 --> 00:05.380
Oh, that's not a tattoo.

00:05.450 --> 00:07.650
That, dear boy,is a tramp stamp.

00:07.720 --> 00:09.950
A tramp stamp.

00:10.020 --> 00:12.390
Kids, too often in life,

00:12.490 --> 00:14.560
We make decisions that we're
not prepared to live with.

00:16.120 --> 00:18.730
This is a story about those decisions,

00:18.790 --> 00:22.060
And the consequences that follow.

00:22.130 --> 00:23.730
Say good-Bye, kids,

00:23.800 --> 00:26.570
'Cause it won't be around much longer.

00:26.670 --> 00:28.370
Oh, but ted, if you get
rid of the butterfly,

00:28.440 --> 00:29.600
How's everyone gonna know

00:29.670 --> 00:31.670
You're a stripper from
reno with daddy issues?

00:32.540 --> 00:35.910
Yes, yes,enjoy these
final moments of mockery

00:35.980 --> 00:39.050
Because in just ten
surprisingly expensive sessions,

00:39.110 --> 00:41.180
Stella is gonna zap that butterfly

00:41.215 --> 00:43.250
Right off the face of my lower back.

00:43.350 --> 00:45.220
- Stella?
- Dr. Stella zinman.

00:45.290 --> 00:46.220
She's the best in the business.

00:46.290 --> 00:47.620
And she's rather cute.

00:47.720 --> 00:50.560
In fact... we're going to
a movie together tonight.

00:50.630 --> 00:51.590
What?

00:51.660 --> 00:52.960
I asked her out.

00:53.030 --> 00:54.400
Ted, why would you do that?

00:54.460 --> 00:55.730
What's the matter with you?

00:55.800 --> 00:56.760
- What?What do you mean?
- Dude...

00:56.830 --> 00:59.100
Don't poop where you eat.

00:59.170 --> 01:01.340
Oh, no, this doesn't count.

01:01.400 --> 01:02.710
If it's someone you
see on a regular basis,

01:02.745 --> 01:04.810
And you can't avoid them...

01:04.870 --> 01:05.810
And in this case,you're paying them...

01:05.870 --> 01:06.710
Then yes, it counts.

01:06.810 --> 01:08.040
Ted,

01:08.140 --> 01:09.810
You've heard of the golden rule, right?

01:09.910 --> 01:10.910
"Love thy neighbor?"

01:10.980 --> 01:12.465
Uh, actually,it's "do unto others

01:12.500 --> 01:13.950
As you would have them do unto you. "

01:14.020 --> 01:15.650
It's from the bible.

01:15.720 --> 01:18.320
Damn it, ted, i've worked
out this whole thing

01:18.420 --> 01:20.020
Where the golden rule
is"love thy neighbor,"

01:22.620 --> 01:24.730
Now, the golden rule
is"love thy neighbor. "

01:24.790 --> 01:27.430
But there's one rule above it:

01:27.530 --> 01:29.260
The platinum rule:

01:29.330 --> 01:34.100
"Never ever, ever,
ever,love thy neighbor. "

01:34.170 --> 01:35.470
Well, that's cute.

01:35.540 --> 01:37.810
But she's not my
neighbor;she's my doctor.

01:37.870 --> 01:38.610
- So if you'll exse me...
- Wait, ted,

01:38.710 --> 01:39.470
Barney has a point.

01:39.540 --> 01:42.580
Remember what happened with me
and curt down at the station?

01:42.640 --> 01:43.850
Oh, yeah, and remember
what happened with us

01:43.910 --> 01:44.580
And the gerards across the hall?

01:44.650 --> 01:45.810
Need i remind you

01:45.880 --> 01:47.450
About me and wendy the waitress?

01:47.520 --> 01:49.150
Yeah, i don't have time for this.

01:49.250 --> 01:51.350
I'm out the door as soon as
i'm finished with my hair.

01:51.450 --> 01:53.190
Good, then we've got a solid half hour.

01:53.390 --> 01:56.590
And in that time,we will convince you

01:56.690 --> 01:58.460
Not to set foot out that door.

01:58.560 --> 02:00.630
It's a story older than time, my friend,

02:00.730 --> 02:03.630
And it always plays out
in the same eight steps.

02:03.700 --> 02:05.630
Step 1: attraction.

02:05.700 --> 02:08.370
It's true.

02:08.440 --> 02:09.400
That's not even possible.

02:09.470 --> 02:10.610
-12 of them.
- There's no way.

02:12.010 --> 02:13.610
- Here's your gin and tonic.
- Thanks.

02:13.710 --> 02:14.710
Oh, gosh.

02:14.780 --> 02:16.410
Look at that.

02:22.550 --> 02:23.620
You must be our new neighbors.

02:23.690 --> 02:24.850
- I'm michael.
- And i'm laura.

02:24.920 --> 02:27.090
Oh, hi, welcome to the building. Yeah.

02:27.160 --> 02:29.390
Do you guys know any good
brunch places around here?

02:29.460 --> 02:31.260
We love brunch!

02:35.430 --> 02:36.530
You must be robin.

02:38.600 --> 02:40.000
Curt "the iron man" irons.

02:40.070 --> 02:41.340
I'm gonna be doing sports.

02:41.400 --> 02:44.410
Oh. Welcome.

02:44.510 --> 02:45.410
You look really familiar.

02:45.470 --> 02:46.810
Are you a former athlete?

02:46.870 --> 02:47.980
Hockey.

02:48.040 --> 02:51.480
The attraction is
instant and undeniable.

02:51.550 --> 02:52.950
But you know better.

02:53.050 --> 02:56.450
You've seen your friends
make the same mistakes before.

02:56.520 --> 02:58.090
You've laughed smugly at them.

02:58.190 --> 02:59.950
Idiots.

03:00.020 --> 03:02.025
But still, you think,

03:02.060 --> 03:06.060
"This is different. The platinum
rule doesn't apply to me. "

03:06.130 --> 03:07.660
And that's step 2.

03:07.730 --> 03:08.660
Bargaining.

03:08.730 --> 03:13.430
- I think i've got a little crush on our sports guy.
- No.

03:13.500 --> 03:14.400
- No, don't do it.
- No, no.

03:14.470 --> 03:16.000
I know, i know.

03:16.070 --> 03:18.010
But he used to play
hockey,and i'm a canadian.

03:18.070 --> 03:19.040
I can't help it.

03:19.110 --> 03:21.080
If he were missing some teeth,

03:21.180 --> 03:22.410
I probably would've already hit that.

03:22.480 --> 03:24.550
Robin, it's a mistake.

03:24.610 --> 03:26.880
Remember what happened
with me and marshall?

03:26.950 --> 03:28.380
The gerards across the hall?

03:28.450 --> 03:29.550
Michael and laura.

03:29.620 --> 03:31.490
They're awesome!

03:31.590 --> 03:33.120
We're gonna invite them over for dinner.

03:33.190 --> 03:34.120
- No! No!Really?
- Are you insane?

03:34.190 --> 03:35.490
Guys, guys, guys,

03:35.560 --> 03:36.990
This is new york city.

03:37.060 --> 03:38.090
You don't get close to the neighbors.

03:38.390 --> 03:40.230
You nod at them politely in the hall.

03:40.330 --> 03:42.200
You call the cops if you
haven't seen them in a while

03:42.260 --> 03:45.270
And you smell something
funny, and that is it.

03:45.330 --> 03:46.430
We're not gonna date them.

03:46.500 --> 03:47.540
We're just gonna be friends with them.

03:47.600 --> 03:49.500
That's the couples version of dating.

03:49.570 --> 03:51.470
And you've got the couples
version of the hots for them.

03:53.710 --> 03:55.510
You want to browse at
pottery barn with them.

03:55.580 --> 03:56.680
You want to go antiquing
with them, don't you?

03:59.280 --> 04:01.390
You want to antique
the crap out of them.

04:01.450 --> 04:02.520
Need i remind you

04:02.590 --> 04:06.360
What happened with me
and wendy the waitress?

04:06.420 --> 04:08.130
I've decided to seduce
wendy the waitress.

04:08.230 --> 04:09.160
No!

04:09.230 --> 04:10.160
- Don't do it!
- Request denied!

04:10.230 --> 04:12.600
What rule is there

04:12.660 --> 04:14.300
That says i can't seduce the
waitress at my favorite bar?

04:14.360 --> 04:17.100
I don't know. I'd expect
you to have one already.

04:17.170 --> 04:18.740
Yeah, with some sort of catchy name.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.140
Well, i don't.

04:20.200 --> 04:22.410
I don't have one and i never will be

04:22.470 --> 04:23.770
Because it's a great idea.

04:23.870 --> 04:24.880
Come on, guys.

04:24.940 --> 04:26.340
She's gullible. I'm bored.

04:26.440 --> 04:27.840
We're perfect for each other.

04:27.910 --> 04:28.780
Barney.

04:28.850 --> 04:30.210
We love this bar.

04:30.280 --> 04:32.280
If you screw over wendy the waitress,

04:32.350 --> 04:34.080
You're going to kill the bar.

04:34.150 --> 04:36.690
- Bar-Killer. -Don't
kill the bar, dude.

04:36.750 --> 04:40.290
Yeah, well... i think it'll be okay.

04:40.360 --> 04:42.290
And it was a huge mistake.

04:42.360 --> 04:45.830
Yeah, well, i think it'll be okay.

04:45.900 --> 04:48.100
And it was a huge mistake.

04:48.170 --> 04:52.170
Yeah, well... i think it'll be okay.

04:52.240 --> 04:54.400
And it was a huge mistake.

04:54.470 --> 04:58.040
Yeah, well... i think it'll be okay.

05:00.000 --> 05:06.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:11.740 --> 05:13.010
Ted,trust me

05:13.110 --> 05:15.080
You don't want to do this.

05:15.140 --> 05:16.710
Look, stella and i are both adults.

05:16.780 --> 05:18.580
We're both smart, mature people

05:18.650 --> 05:20.150
Capable of making good decisions.

05:20.220 --> 05:23.220
You have a butterfly tramp stamp.

05:23.280 --> 05:25.220
We're just seeing a movie.

05:25.290 --> 05:27.420
If it seems at all weird,i'll back off.

05:27.520 --> 05:29.420
That's what everyone thinks.

05:29.490 --> 05:31.160
And then along comes step 3:

05:31.260 --> 05:33.090
Submission.

05:33.160 --> 05:35.030
Night.

05:35.100 --> 05:36.870
Hey, barney.

05:36.930 --> 05:39.100
Carl had to take off. You
mind giving me a hand?

05:39.170 --> 05:42.100
Not at all.

05:43.740 --> 05:45.270
Robin.

05:45.340 --> 05:46.310
I got two tickets to the rangers.

05:46.370 --> 05:47.380
Center ice.

05:47.440 --> 05:48.180
Want to go?

05:50.980 --> 05:53.210
And then we discover the movers
lost all our kitchen boxes.

05:53.280 --> 05:54.920
We don't have a single pot or pan.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.120
Guess we're ordering take-Out.

05:56.180 --> 06:00.160
Want to have dinner with us tonight?

06:24.150 --> 06:26.150
- I love them.
- Me, too.

06:35.120 --> 06:38.060
That was an interesting
use of the beverage gun.

06:38.160 --> 06:40.160
Club soda can get anything off.

06:41.460 --> 06:43.400
It finally happened.

06:43.470 --> 06:45.170
All this time,

06:45.230 --> 06:47.640
Every drink i brought you...

06:47.700 --> 06:50.240
I always felt there was this
unspoken connection between us.

06:50.310 --> 06:52.510
And i was right.

06:52.570 --> 06:56.380
Hey, can i get a gin and tonic?

06:56.440 --> 06:58.710
See, i bet you didn't pay
for that gin and tonic.

06:58.780 --> 07:01.720
Oh, i paid for it.

07:01.780 --> 07:03.150
But you got to admit,there is an upside

07:03.250 --> 07:04.220
To breaking the platinum rule.

07:04.290 --> 07:05.520
Like maybe as her boyfriend,

07:05.590 --> 07:07.090
I could get a discount on treatments.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.190
Oh, ted.

07:08.260 --> 07:09.490
Of course there's an upside.

07:10.090 --> 07:11.060
At first.

07:11.130 --> 07:12.160
That's step 4.

07:12.230 --> 07:13.560
Perks.

07:13.630 --> 07:15.700
We can split a cab to work together.

07:15.760 --> 07:18.130
We always have a standing lunch date.

07:18.200 --> 07:19.670
And last night,at the hockey game,

07:19.730 --> 07:21.100
Curt got us into the locker room,

07:21.170 --> 07:24.140
And i met mason raymond.

07:24.210 --> 07:26.070
Left wing for the vancouver canucks.

07:27.310 --> 07:29.080
What's the opposite of name-Dropping?

07:29.140 --> 07:31.210
Damn it, you guys.

07:31.280 --> 07:32.250
Be psyched.

07:32.310 --> 07:33.650
Yes, we see each other every day,

07:33.750 --> 07:35.380
But i think it's going really well.

07:35.450 --> 07:37.020
That's what we thought.

07:37.090 --> 07:39.090
And it's so convenient.

07:39.190 --> 07:40.260
They're right across the hall.

07:40.320 --> 07:41.920
Say it's sunday,

07:42.020 --> 07:44.290
And we want to have a brunch
double date with someone?

07:44.360 --> 07:46.590
We just go across the hall.

07:46.660 --> 07:48.030
And say we want to have a dinner party

07:48.100 --> 07:49.760
Exploring the wine and cuisine

07:49.860 --> 07:51.600
Of france's loire valley?

07:51.670 --> 07:53.470
We just go across the hall.

07:53.570 --> 07:55.270
Say we want to play
a game of charades...

08:04.950 --> 08:06.080
You just go across the hall?

08:07.220 --> 08:09.320
Come on, people. Get excited for us.

08:09.380 --> 08:11.890
We've got a great thing going here.

08:11.950 --> 08:13.490
That's what i thought.

08:13.560 --> 08:15.820
- Dude, you got to flick it.
- You don't...

08:15.890 --> 08:17.130
Hi, sweetie.

08:17.230 --> 08:19.160
I had the kitchen whip
these up, no charge.

08:21.130 --> 08:23.060
Okay.

08:23.130 --> 08:25.370
Bye.

08:25.430 --> 08:27.040
I mean, not bye. I'm not leaving.

08:27.100 --> 08:29.670
I'll be over there.

08:29.770 --> 08:31.340
Okay.

08:35.110 --> 08:37.150
Come on, guys. Free nachos.

08:38.580 --> 08:39.280
What?

08:39.350 --> 08:41.120
We like this bar.

08:41.179 --> 08:42.419
Don't kill the bar, dude.

08:42.520 --> 08:44.090
Nay, we love this bar. Don't
kill the bar, dude.

08:44.150 --> 08:45.950
This bar is like home to us.

08:46.020 --> 08:48.060
- Don't kill the bar, dude.
- You're killing the bar.

08:48.120 --> 08:50.130
I am not killing the bar.

08:50.190 --> 08:51.330
Wendy the waitress

08:51.390 --> 08:53.230
Has seen how i operate in this place.

08:53.290 --> 08:54.100
It is perfectly clear

08:54.160 --> 08:55.660
To everyone involved

08:55.730 --> 08:58.670
That this is nothing more
than a temporary fling.

09:03.300 --> 09:06.140
It's fine.

09:06.210 --> 09:07.640
But it wasn't.

09:07.710 --> 09:09.110
It's fine.

09:09.180 --> 09:11.050
But it wasn't.

09:11.110 --> 09:13.310
It's fine.

09:13.380 --> 09:16.080
But it wasn't.

09:16.150 --> 09:17.750
Which brings us to
step 5:THE TIPPING POINT

09:17.820 --> 09:20.520
...but he should be back on the mound

09:20.590 --> 09:21.660
By spring training.

09:21.720 --> 09:22.760
And that's sports.

09:22.820 --> 09:23.960
Back to you, robin.

09:24.030 --> 09:25.290
Thanks,iron man.

09:25.360 --> 09:26.230
We'll be right back.

09:26.290 --> 09:28.300
And clear.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.200
So want to do something later?

09:30.270 --> 09:32.100
Oh, so you're talking to me now?

09:32.170 --> 09:35.070
What are you talking about?

09:35.140 --> 09:37.470
I'm talking about last night.

09:37.540 --> 09:39.440
You said you'd call and you didn't.

09:39.510 --> 09:41.180
I missed you and i waited
up, but you didn't call.

09:41.240 --> 09:43.780
That really hurt.

09:45.210 --> 09:48.780
Um, i'm sorry, i-I guess i just forgot.

09:48.850 --> 09:50.490
I'm sorry, sweetie.

09:50.550 --> 09:52.450
I don't want to fight tonight.

09:52.520 --> 09:55.360
It's our first weekiversary.

09:57.090 --> 09:59.160
On my suggestion,you...

10:01.200 --> 10:04.100
Hey, wendy, uh,do me a favor

10:04.170 --> 10:05.530
And send a glass of champagne

10:05.600 --> 10:06.300
To that pretty young thing over there.

10:06.370 --> 10:07.170
What?

10:10.340 --> 10:12.170
Over there.

10:12.240 --> 10:14.540
You.

10:14.610 --> 10:17.250
You're the pretty young thing...

10:17.310 --> 10:19.150
Is what i meant.

10:20.180 --> 10:22.420
Champagne? Would you? On me.

10:22.480 --> 10:24.220
Oh. Okay.

10:24.290 --> 10:25.620
Thanks, sweetie.

10:25.690 --> 10:27.990
Okay.

10:28.060 --> 10:29.360
All right.

10:33.230 --> 10:35.230
Hey, neighbors.

10:35.300 --> 10:37.100
We bought all the fixings
for a mexican fiesta.

10:39.030 --> 10:41.370
Um, well, we actually have tickets...

10:41.440 --> 10:43.140
And no fiesta would
be complete without...

10:43.240 --> 10:44.470
Dude, actually,we
made other plans, so...

10:44.540 --> 10:46.110
Okay. One word.

10:46.170 --> 10:47.880
Two syllables. Sounds like...

10:50.650 --> 10:51.380
..."parade. "Charades.

10:51.450 --> 10:53.080
Charades.

10:53.150 --> 10:54.180
What do you say?

11:04.730 --> 11:07.830
- Oh, no. -Oh,
no. -Oh, no.

11:10.760 --> 11:12.160
Which brings to step 6.

11:12.230 --> 11:13.460
Yeah, listen,i'm leaving.

11:13.530 --> 11:14.830
So if you want to write
the rest of these down,

11:14.900 --> 11:17.200
I will read it tomorrow.

11:17.270 --> 11:18.270
Don't do this, ted.

11:18.330 --> 11:19.400
You want to get out of the way?

11:19.470 --> 11:21.200
- Don't do this, ted.
- All right.

11:21.270 --> 11:22.370
Don't.

11:22.470 --> 11:24.470
Dude! Gah!

11:24.540 --> 11:25.480
It was perfect!

11:25.580 --> 11:27.410
You're such a jerk.

11:27.480 --> 11:30.180
Which brings us to step 6.

11:30.250 --> 11:32.010
You finally realize
you've made a huge mistake

11:32.080 --> 11:33.480
And now you have to live with it.

11:33.550 --> 11:36.120
Step 6 is called purg... wait for it.

11:36.190 --> 11:38.150
Keep waiting...

11:38.220 --> 11:40.490
Keep waiting for all eternity

11:40.560 --> 11:43.130
Only to discover there's
no escape- Atory.

11:43.190 --> 11:45.160
God, i'm such

11:45.230 --> 11:46.530
An idiot.

11:46.600 --> 11:48.160
Yeah.

11:48.230 --> 11:50.870
Curt "the iron man" irons

11:50.930 --> 11:52.770
Keeps leaving me love
notes on post-Its.

11:52.870 --> 11:54.540
On the teleprompter,on my desk,

11:55.070 --> 11:56.640
On the coffee-Maker,

11:56.740 --> 12:00.780
On the jar of sugar packets
next to the coffee-Maker.

12:00.840 --> 12:02.810
"Here's some sugar for my sugar. "

12:02.880 --> 12:04.150
The iron man.

12:06.180 --> 12:09.120
I remember that.

12:09.190 --> 12:10.650
God, we are such idiots.

12:10.720 --> 12:12.020
Yup.

12:12.090 --> 12:13.190
Every time we step out the door,

12:13.260 --> 12:15.060
They're out there waiting for us.

12:15.120 --> 12:17.990
Sometimes, we'll send
ted out first as a scout.

12:18.060 --> 12:19.630
Nobody's there.

12:19.700 --> 12:23.330
Then we'll go out one second
later, and there they are.

12:23.400 --> 12:24.600
It's freakin' supernatural.

12:24.670 --> 12:26.740
Are they ghosts?Can only we see them?

12:26.800 --> 12:28.570
"Hey, neighbor. "Hey,
neighbor. "Hey, neighbor. "

12:31.110 --> 12:32.810
Hmm, i remember that.

12:32.880 --> 12:35.080
How could you guys let me
date wendy the waitress?

12:35.180 --> 12:36.650
- Oh, you are kidding me.
- What?!

12:36.710 --> 12:38.580
- Don't kill the bar, dude.
- We said, "don't do it. "

12:48.830 --> 12:50.490
My own bar.

12:50.590 --> 12:54.130
I can't hit on women in my own bar.

12:54.200 --> 12:55.330
Remember the old barney?

12:55.400 --> 12:57.700
He was a lion,the king of the jungle,

12:57.800 --> 13:00.900
Stalking whatever prey he chose,

13:00.970 --> 13:03.210
Going in for the kill.

13:03.270 --> 13:04.470
You've got a whole meat locker at home

13:04.540 --> 13:06.110
Full of corpses,don't you?

13:06.180 --> 13:07.210
Now look at me.

13:07.280 --> 13:09.710
Clawed. Neutered.

13:09.780 --> 13:11.380
What was once

13:11.450 --> 13:13.080
My jungle is now my zoo.

13:13.150 --> 13:17.150
And i am forced to mate
with the same old lioness

13:17.220 --> 13:20.220
Again and again and again,

13:20.290 --> 13:22.290
While families pay to watch.

13:22.360 --> 13:25.330
Yeah, this metaphor's
really falling apart.

13:25.400 --> 13:30.270
Put a bell around my neck
and scratch my belly, kids,

13:30.330 --> 13:34.470
For i am just a docile housecat now.

13:35.510 --> 13:37.810
Meow.

13:37.870 --> 13:39.640
Well, we love this bar.

13:39.710 --> 13:41.080
You can't dump her.

13:41.180 --> 13:43.110
Marry her if you have to.

13:43.180 --> 13:45.820
Wendy the waitress hyphen stinson.

13:45.920 --> 13:47.120
Don't kill the bar, dude.

13:52.160 --> 13:54.360
And so, inevitably,you
have to do the thing

13:54.420 --> 13:55.390
You've been dreading all along.

13:55.460 --> 13:57.660
Now, a relationship-Ectomy

13:57.730 --> 14:00.060
Is a delicate surgery as it is,

14:00.160 --> 14:02.170
But in the case of the platinum rule,

14:02.270 --> 14:06.340
It takes a very, very
steady hand, and that's

14:06.440 --> 14:09.140
Step 7: confrontation.

14:12.680 --> 14:16.180
Curt, we need to talk.

14:17.180 --> 14:18.750
I like you...

14:18.820 --> 14:20.420
Guys, we like you a lot...

14:20.480 --> 14:21.450
I don't like you.

14:23.150 --> 14:26.190
We're pretending this
works,but it doesn't.

14:26.260 --> 14:28.760
And i'm getting a little
sick of the whole charade.

14:28.830 --> 14:30.330
We're getting a little sick of charades.

14:30.390 --> 14:32.230
I mean, i don't like you that way.

14:32.300 --> 14:34.000
I used to like you that way.

14:34.060 --> 14:35.300
But now that i've seen everything

14:35.370 --> 14:36.930
There is to see, i don't know,

14:37.000 --> 14:39.100
I kind of want to see those same parts

14:39.170 --> 14:41.200
Just on other girls.

14:41.270 --> 14:45.140
So maybe, we could go back
to just being coworkers.

14:46.410 --> 14:48.980
Maybe we should just go
back to being neighbors.

14:50.010 --> 14:51.050
Other girls and you,

14:51.110 --> 14:52.420
If you're into that.

14:52.520 --> 14:55.180
But the other girls
have to be there, too.

14:55.250 --> 14:57.220
That's the important part.

14:57.290 --> 15:00.920
Gosh, you're just terrified

15:00.990 --> 15:03.730
Of ever getting close
to anyone, aren't you?

15:03.790 --> 15:05.190
Or that.

15:05.260 --> 15:06.130
Let's say it's that.

15:07.260 --> 15:09.370
So can i get a gin and tonic?

15:11.200 --> 15:12.670
And in any other relationship,

15:12.740 --> 15:13.570
That would be it.

15:13.640 --> 15:15.470
End of story.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.070
But because you have to
see this person again,

15:17.170 --> 15:20.310
There's a step 8: fallout.

15:20.380 --> 15:22.080
And now, here's

15:22.150 --> 15:25.210
Curt "the iron man" irons with sports.

15:25.280 --> 15:26.680
Curt?

15:29.220 --> 15:31.190
Curt?

15:37.160 --> 15:38.860
Well, the knicks lost.

15:38.930 --> 15:41.030
It's sad, really.

15:41.100 --> 15:43.100
They had a real shot.

15:43.170 --> 15:46.940
Then, out of nowhere, game over.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.110
And why?

15:49.170 --> 15:50.270
Why, Robin?

15:51.470 --> 15:54.040
Uh, well, their perimeter shooting

15:54.110 --> 15:56.150
Has been a little bit off this season...

15:56.250 --> 15:58.110
The knicks lost because they
were afraid of getting hurt.

15:58.180 --> 15:59.820
So they didn't even try.

15:59.880 --> 16:01.150
Well, you know what I think?

16:01.220 --> 16:03.590
I think

16:03.650 --> 16:06.120
The knicks didn't deserve
my love to begin with.

16:06.190 --> 16:08.020
The knicks suck.

16:14.100 --> 16:16.170
And that's sports.

16:16.230 --> 16:18.570
Do you see anything?

16:18.630 --> 16:19.770
I think we're clear.

16:19.840 --> 16:21.170
Okay, go, go, go!

16:29.210 --> 16:31.150
That was close.

16:31.210 --> 16:32.180
Too close.

16:33.320 --> 16:34.480
You've got to be kidding me.

16:34.580 --> 16:35.250
What do we do?

16:35.350 --> 16:37.350
I have no idea.

16:39.390 --> 16:40.760
Guys, are you there?

16:40.820 --> 16:42.090
I forgot my keys. Can you open up?

16:42.160 --> 16:44.160
It's just ted.

16:44.230 --> 16:45.960
Wait!

16:47.460 --> 16:48.260
Hello?

16:48.330 --> 16:50.170
Guys?

16:57.740 --> 17:01.110
Baby, we only have one choice.

17:01.180 --> 17:02.780
Okay, hurry! Michael
and laura are probably...

17:05.150 --> 17:06.720
Hey, neighbors.

17:08.550 --> 17:12.060
Barney, I just want you to
know, I have no hard feelings.

17:12.119 --> 17:13.560
It wasn't the best idea

17:13.619 --> 17:14.660
For us to get involved.

17:14.720 --> 17:17.130
I hope we can still be friends.

17:17.190 --> 17:18.490
Thanks, Wendy.

17:18.560 --> 17:19.829
Of course we can.

17:19.900 --> 17:20.829
If you need anything else, let me know.

17:24.430 --> 17:26.170
I've got to hand it
to wendy the waitress

17:26.270 --> 17:27.240
That was very mature of her.

17:27.300 --> 17:29.170
She's gonna try to kill me.

17:30.670 --> 17:32.140
This is poisoned.

17:32.210 --> 17:33.480
What? You're being ridiculous.

17:33.580 --> 17:35.040
Yours is poisoned, too.

17:35.140 --> 17:36.680
She's trying to kill me
and everyone close to me.

17:36.750 --> 17:38.280
- What are you talking about?
- Ted!

17:38.350 --> 17:40.220
Look at the facts I dump her.

17:40.280 --> 17:42.120
And she says, "no hard feelings. "

17:43.290 --> 17:44.320
She's a psycho!

17:44.390 --> 17:45.790
What other explanation is there?

17:45.860 --> 17:48.560
Uh, that you're letting
yourself believe she's crazy

17:48.620 --> 17:50.690
So you don't have to face the
far more likely possibility

17:50.760 --> 17:52.160
That she doesn't want
to date you either?

17:53.660 --> 17:55.130
Where did marshall

17:55.200 --> 17:56.200
Get that hamburger?

17:56.270 --> 17:57.500
I don't know, I guess

17:57.570 --> 17:59.300
Wendy the Waitress brought it to him.

17:59.370 --> 18:00.900
Noooooo!

18:07.680 --> 18:10.150
Dude.

18:10.210 --> 18:12.220
You're welcome.

18:12.280 --> 18:13.180
Wait a second.

18:13.250 --> 18:14.780
You've been sitting here,

18:14.850 --> 18:18.190
Pretending to be 
the expert on all this,

18:18.250 --> 18:20.460
But the truth is, the
was no real fallout

18:20.520 --> 18:21.720
From your breakup at all?

18:21.790 --> 18:23.160
Yet.

18:23.230 --> 18:24.660
You're an idiot.

18:24.730 --> 18:26.130
Alright, I'm taking off.

18:26.200 --> 18:27.630
- What?!
- I have a date.

18:30.270 --> 18:32.400
- Wha...?
- You are such a jerk!

18:32.470 --> 18:35.270
Ted, have you not been listening?

18:35.340 --> 18:36.970
Attraction, bargaining, submission,

18:37.040 --> 18:39.080
Perks, tipping point,

18:39.140 --> 18:40.840
Purgatory, confrontation, fallout!

18:40.910 --> 18:42.180
These things will all happen to you

18:42.280 --> 18:43.950
As surely as they happened to all of us!

18:44.010 --> 18:45.210
It's a rule of nature!

18:45.280 --> 18:47.550
Well, i'm sick of all the rules!

18:47.650 --> 18:48.850
There's too many of them!

18:48.920 --> 18:49.950
The hot/crazy scale, the lemon law,

18:50.020 --> 18:51.750
The platinum rule...

18:51.820 --> 18:52.920
If everyone in the world

18:52.990 --> 18:54.160
Followed every one of your rules,

18:54.220 --> 18:56.590
The human race would cease to exist.

18:56.660 --> 18:58.800
Yes, chances are

18:58.860 --> 19:00.060
Stella and i are not

19:00.130 --> 19:01.400
Going to live happily ever after.

19:01.460 --> 19:03.870
The overwhelming odds
have it ending badly.

19:03.970 --> 19:05.400
And when that happens,

19:05.470 --> 19:07.600
It'll be for one of a
million possible reasons.

19:07.670 --> 19:09.170
But that doesn't mean i'm not gonna try.

19:09.240 --> 19:11.170
And when it does fail,

19:11.240 --> 19:14.180
So help me god, it's not
gonna be because of some rule.

19:15.710 --> 19:18.280
P.S.

19:18.350 --> 19:21.550
You just made my hair look awesome.

19:21.620 --> 19:22.920
Good night.

19:25.290 --> 19:27.390
So stella and i went on our date.

19:27.460 --> 19:29.360
But here's the funny thing:

19:29.430 --> 19:31.160
Turns out, it wasn't actually a date.

19:32.560 --> 19:34.230
So what do you mean "it wasn't a date"?

19:34.300 --> 19:36.270
She thought we were seeing
a movie just as friends.

19:36.330 --> 19:38.100
Why would she think that?

19:38.170 --> 19:39.300
Did she see your tattoo

19:39.370 --> 19:41.140
And assume you were gay?

19:41.200 --> 19:44.140
Apparently, there's a rule
that says i can't date stella.

19:44.210 --> 19:46.280
Exactly: the platinum rule.

19:46.340 --> 19:47.840
Stella reads my blog.

19:47.940 --> 19:50.110
No, this rule comes from the
american medical association.

19:50.180 --> 19:53.180
Doctors aren't legally
allowed to date their patients.

19:53.250 --> 19:55.050
Oh, sorry, ted.

19:55.120 --> 19:56.150
Eh, it's okay.

19:56.220 --> 19:58.450
What are you guys watching?

19:58.520 --> 20:00.120
So that was the end of the story

20:00.190 --> 20:03.160
Between me and stella, at
least for the time being.

20:03.230 --> 20:05.800
But i don't know, looking
back on the platinum rule,

20:05.860 --> 20:07.130
I think there's a ninth step.

20:07.200 --> 20:09.130
We'll call it coexistence.

20:09.200 --> 20:11.530
It's the moment you
realize that all that anger

20:11.600 --> 20:13.570
And resentment just isn't useful.

20:13.640 --> 20:14.740
Thanks for watching.

20:14.800 --> 20:17.840
Good night.

20:17.910 --> 20:20.080
And you start to let go of it.

20:20.140 --> 20:21.410
Hey, guys.

20:22.080 --> 20:24.110
So what do you guys
have going on tonight?

20:24.180 --> 20:25.780
We're going to have a few friends over.

20:25.850 --> 20:27.150
Gonna play some charades.

20:27.220 --> 20:28.750
Have fun.

20:32.290 --> 20:33.790
And move on with your life.

20:33.860 --> 20:35.660
It just takes a while.

20:35.760 --> 20:37.030
On the house.

20:37.090 --> 20:39.100
Thanks.
