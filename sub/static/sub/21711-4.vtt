WEBVTT

01:06.609 --> 01:08.569
Please, pay attention!

01:08.694 --> 01:12.698
I need you to put your phones,
beepers and radios in the container.

01:12.823 --> 01:14.617
Is this necessary, Agent Peña?

01:14.742 --> 01:18.204
- I'm afraid so, Captain.
- Please, I'll take that.

01:18.329 --> 01:20.998
One of my guys
says one of your guys

01:21.123 --> 01:23.334
is working for the cartel.

01:24.960 --> 01:27.713
- They have any proof?
- Can't say yet.

01:28.506 --> 01:32.009
But this warrant will be hard to execute
if they're one step ahead.

01:34.678 --> 01:36.764
It's just a precaution.

01:37.848 --> 01:40.059
<i>- Gracias.</i>
- Okay.

01:41.018 --> 01:44.146
For the next three hours,
we'll be running silent.

01:44.271 --> 01:49.235
- My colleagues and I will take the lead.
- And the target?

01:49.360 --> 01:53.072
I'll just say that it's everything
you've trained for.

01:56.325 --> 02:01.705
We're advisors. We work together,
same as always. Credit's all yours.

02:07.419 --> 02:12.383
Gentlemen, you heard!
I need you to be tight and right!

02:12.508 --> 02:14.135
- Understood?
- Yes, sir!

02:14.260 --> 02:15.719
Let's go.

02:32.319 --> 02:34.321
In case you're confused,
<i>Capitán Calderón,</i>

02:34.446 --> 02:38.075
I wouldn't have come all the way
from Bogotá if it wasn't a big deal.

02:39.076 --> 02:42.538
My men's safety,
that's what I care about.

02:43.205 --> 02:46.000
I make the final call
if anything feels off.

02:47.042 --> 02:48.460
You follow?

02:54.842 --> 02:58.512
My kid gave it to me
right before I went out on this buy-bust.

02:58.637 --> 03:02.474
Some Jamaican took a rip at me,
missed by that much, so...

03:03.601 --> 03:06.228
I rub it for luck ever since.

03:35.382 --> 03:38.385
So, what are we doing here?

03:40.304 --> 03:42.681
We're arresting
one of the godfathers of Cali.

05:39.131 --> 05:45.095
'Applauded
by the multitude present on 10th street,

05:45.220 --> 05:51.143
'president-elect Ernesto Samper Pizano
is welcomed by the people of Colombia...'

05:51.268 --> 05:54.521
'I don't give
Gilberto Rodríguez credit for much,

05:54.646 --> 05:56.357
'but I have to hand it to him...'

05:57.983 --> 06:00.152
'...he was a man in control.'

06:00.277 --> 06:02.363
It's too early.

06:02.488 --> 06:08.118
- I rise early. I'm up with the sun.
- Up all right!

06:09.745 --> 06:12.414
'He was married to three women.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.541
'At the same time.

06:14.666 --> 06:18.379
'And he managed them
the same way he ran his business...

06:18.504 --> 06:20.714
'scheduled down to the minute.

06:26.178 --> 06:29.807
'Wife number three got him
Monday and Tuesday.'

06:29.932 --> 06:33.727
- Hi!
- How did it go, honey?

06:34.978 --> 06:37.481
Very good! Look, what a beauty.

06:39.650 --> 06:45.030
'Number two...
got him Wednesday and Thursday.

06:47.491 --> 06:51.495
'And wife number one got him
on Friday and Saturday...'

06:51.620 --> 06:52.955
'Goal!

06:53.080 --> 06:57.126
What defence is that? Piece of shit!
I'm paying your fucking salaries!

06:57.251 --> 06:59.294
'Sundays were for football.'

07:00.671 --> 07:04.550
'All the wives were invited
if they wanted to come. They usually did.'

07:04.675 --> 07:05.968
Thank you.

07:06.093 --> 07:09.179
'And they all got along.
That was the deal.

07:09.304 --> 07:12.433
'And he made it work.
He insisted on it.

07:13.350 --> 07:15.561
'He made far more friends
than enemies.'

07:15.686 --> 07:17.980
I can help you expand your businesses...

07:18.105 --> 07:20.315
'And he would count on those friends
to protect him.'

07:20.441 --> 07:22.568
I could help you make millions.

07:22.693 --> 07:25.863
'His retirement was going
to go his way, too.

07:25.988 --> 07:28.699
'He wasn't going to die
on some shitty rooftop.

07:28.824 --> 07:32.870
'Nobody was stabbing him in the back,
nobody forcing him out.

07:32.995 --> 07:36.623
'Like I said,
he was a man in control.

07:36.748 --> 07:39.042
'The guy who never made
a wrong move in his life.

07:39.168 --> 07:42.421
'A guy who built a billion-dollar empire
brick by brick.

07:42.546 --> 07:45.090
'A guy who owned every cop in town.

07:45.215 --> 07:49.511
'A guy with a get-out-of-jail-free card
burning a hole in his pocket.

07:49.636 --> 07:52.306
'And you want to go after him? Shit.

07:52.431 --> 07:57.519
'You'd have to be crazy, stupid, brave,
and lucky all at the same time.'

07:57.644 --> 08:00.105
Two units: Calderón's and mine.

08:00.230 --> 08:03.484
Breach one here. Breach two... here.

08:04.151 --> 08:07.696
Feistl, Van Ness: pool.
You come in from the back.

08:09.698 --> 08:12.367
- All right, let's do this already.
- Okay.

08:12.493 --> 08:16.497
If anyone kills the godfather, I kill you.

08:16.622 --> 08:20.542
We can't repeat what happened
with Escobar. I want him alive.

08:21.418 --> 08:23.212
Understood?

08:51.865 --> 08:54.117
Go.

09:23.230 --> 09:26.024
- Nobody lives here, boss.
- That's bullshit.

09:26.149 --> 09:28.193
Intel had Pacho here last night.

09:31.405 --> 09:33.699
What do you think? What do we do?

09:33.824 --> 09:35.993
I think there could be hideouts here.

09:36.118 --> 09:38.996
- We have to check the house again.
- All right.

09:39.121 --> 09:41.039
We turn this place upside down.

09:41.164 --> 09:45.627
Gentlemen, we're going to search
every corner of this house, understood?

09:52.509 --> 09:54.636
It's an elegant house in Palmira, boss.

09:54.761 --> 09:57.180
I don't know whose it is,
but it's not one of ours.

09:57.306 --> 10:01.727
Very good. Get out of there
and make sure no one sees you.

10:02.352 --> 10:03.770
Yes, sir.

10:08.025 --> 10:10.402
- Salcedo.
- 'Jorge.'

10:10.527 --> 10:11.820
Sir.

10:14.990 --> 10:17.409
I need you to do something important.

10:17.534 --> 10:19.953
When you leave your house,
you'll find Navegante.

10:20.078 --> 10:22.372
He knows where you have to go.

10:23.457 --> 10:27.085
Of course, sir, but what should I do
with the operation I'm monitoring?

10:28.211 --> 10:31.548
Cordova. Give it to Cordova.

10:32.716 --> 10:37.095
- Jorge... Be careful.
- 'Of course, sir.'

10:47.439 --> 10:50.859
He's one of my best men.
He'll take care of it.

10:54.946 --> 10:57.240
You're a man of your word.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.402
'Juárez...'

11:34.444 --> 11:37.781
So close to heaven
and so far from God.

11:38.699 --> 11:40.492
Impressive.

11:41.827 --> 11:45.330
I'm so glad you brought me
to see the eighth wonder of the world.

11:49.334 --> 11:51.878
Don't be an asshole, Pacho.

11:52.003 --> 11:54.756
El Paso, Texas
is what I wanted you to see.

11:54.881 --> 11:57.551
Fucking NAFTA
changed everything, Pacho.

11:58.844 --> 12:01.388
It's been around for what?
Two years, more or less?

12:01.513 --> 12:05.726
More than two million trucks have
crossed already, many of them ours.

12:05.851 --> 12:07.310
Filled to the brim.

12:07.978 --> 12:10.564
Do you know how many trucks
the Americans check?

12:10.689 --> 12:15.318
Less than ten percent. It's insane.
They don't have the manpower.

12:15.444 --> 12:17.446
Assholes opened the floodgates,

12:17.571 --> 12:22.492
and now they stand there
with a baby's bucket to try and stop it!

12:23.952 --> 12:26.496
This is the right business.
I already know this, man.

12:26.621 --> 12:28.373
No, man, what I'm saying is,

12:28.498 --> 12:32.502
you're getting out of the right business
at the exact wrong time.

12:32.627 --> 12:34.463
And you're going to regret it.

12:36.715 --> 12:38.425
You want some?

12:42.637 --> 12:46.224
Amado, are you suggesting
that I betray my partners?

12:46.349 --> 12:51.146
No. No way.
Why betray? They want to get out.

12:52.189 --> 12:56.109
I'm proposing that we start
something new, you and I.

12:57.110 --> 13:00.530
Just imagine it,
you send it to me, I get it across.

13:00.655 --> 13:05.577
In two years, we'll be flooding
this fucking shitty country.

13:06.953 --> 13:09.831
Think about it, all right?
Think about it.

13:09.956 --> 13:12.751
Just don't take too long,
because in six months,

13:12.876 --> 13:15.420
I need to secure a new supply.

13:17.255 --> 13:19.591
Hopefully, it'll be with you.

13:29.434 --> 13:32.270
Hey...
Give it another once-over?

13:34.481 --> 13:35.816
Okay.

13:41.655 --> 13:43.990
It should be now.

14:00.131 --> 14:01.800
Thirty seconds.

14:08.181 --> 14:11.893
Hey! Hey! You can't park there!

14:13.395 --> 14:17.649
Damn truck. These fucking trucks
are always breaking down.

14:17.774 --> 14:20.902
- You can't park here.
- Let me grab the cables and I'll move it.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.654
Move the fucking truck!

14:32.414 --> 14:35.041
Gilberto!

14:36.835 --> 14:39.379
Someone's ringing the doorbell!

14:40.839 --> 14:44.134
- Careful.
- Sorry, wait just a moment.

14:44.259 --> 14:46.845
Let me get the door.

14:51.683 --> 14:53.935
Gilberto?

14:58.440 --> 15:02.027
Police! Back up.
Quickly! Move it!

15:03.236 --> 15:04.362
Quickly! Move it!

15:04.487 --> 15:06.448
What's going on?

15:06.948 --> 15:09.993
Sit down, ladies.
Sit down, ladies, I won't say it again.

15:12.746 --> 15:14.372
You can't come in here.
Get out.

15:22.339 --> 15:24.507
He's fucking running!

15:41.650 --> 15:44.152
Get up! Look at my face!

15:45.779 --> 15:46.863
Let's go.

15:46.988 --> 15:50.951
- Sit down, Miss.
- I already told you, Gilberto's not home.

15:51.076 --> 15:52.619
Did he contact anyone?

15:53.411 --> 15:55.872
- No one, Colonel.
- No? All good?

15:55.997 --> 15:59.793
Mrs. Rodríguez, I have a federal warrant
signed and executed by myself,

15:59.918 --> 16:03.421
as representative
of the Colombian National Police.

16:05.382 --> 16:08.385
The question is, will you cooperate?

16:38.957 --> 16:40.500
Are you all right?

16:41.793 --> 16:43.044
Yes.

16:46.256 --> 16:48.008
It's good here.

16:56.391 --> 16:58.810
The only thing left
is to demolish the house.

17:01.271 --> 17:04.107
Yeah. Okay.
We're done. I'm calling it.

17:06.776 --> 17:09.654
I'm sorry, I thought we had something.

17:09.779 --> 17:11.698
Welcome to my world.

17:13.033 --> 17:16.745
Well, do what you need to wrap up,
have your men report back.

17:16.870 --> 17:18.788
- Okay.
- Feistl, anything else?

17:18.913 --> 17:21.332
- Ride to the airport?
- Sure.

17:32.135 --> 17:36.264
Look, when we get there,
I think it's better if I go in alone.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.600
These people are angry.

17:38.725 --> 17:44.064
What we're asking of them,
it's an insult on top of their grief.

17:46.149 --> 17:48.610
You're different, Jorge Salcedo.

17:51.112 --> 17:52.989
Different? How?

17:53.114 --> 17:56.910
You're crippled.
You don't carry a gun.

18:00.121 --> 18:02.624
Most people don't carry guns.

18:04.626 --> 18:07.754
Yeah... but you're not most people.

18:08.755 --> 18:12.133
And that's why it's so weird.
Interesting.

18:13.176 --> 18:15.386
That you never carry a gun.

18:18.765 --> 18:22.352
- I see. Why do you think that is?
- I don't know.

18:23.728 --> 18:25.855
Maybe you're scared.

18:30.443 --> 18:33.988
Fear... of what you could do with it.

18:35.156 --> 18:39.160
That you've been walking around a killer
and never knew it.

19:00.849 --> 19:03.184
Pedrito, go in the house!

19:05.270 --> 19:08.898
Good afternoon, Mrs. Salazar.
Calm down, Mrs. Salazar. Calm down.

19:09.983 --> 19:14.445
My name is Jorge Salcedo.
I'd like to speak with you, if I could.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.574
Go right back to where you came from,

19:17.699 --> 19:21.536
and tell that whore
if she wants my grandson,

19:21.661 --> 19:24.038
she can come looking for him.

19:24.164 --> 19:25.790
I just came to talk.

19:26.541 --> 19:28.168
If you don't like what I have to say,

19:28.293 --> 19:30.336
I'll go back to Cali and deliver
whatever message you want.

19:30.461 --> 19:32.547
I'm unarmed. I'm here to talk.

19:33.214 --> 19:39.053
Your boss murdered my son
to take up with his whore wife.

19:39.179 --> 19:43.850
And now you come to take my grandson
far from the only family he has left.

19:43.975 --> 19:47.520
I know this is not what you want to hear.
But she is his mother.

19:48.146 --> 19:50.315
And Miguel Rodríguez is protecting her.

19:50.440 --> 19:52.567
Ha! Protecting?

19:54.027 --> 19:56.196
Is that what they call it now?

19:56.905 --> 19:58.740
And he will be protected as well.

19:58.865 --> 20:03.870
And if you let me take him back, I promise
you can see him whenever you'd like.

20:03.995 --> 20:07.665
Ah, you promise?
How nice of you.

20:09.292 --> 20:11.669
Who told you I would do that?

20:11.794 --> 20:16.257
I have him here and I can see him
whenever I want and protect him.

20:16.382 --> 20:18.551
That bitch made her choice.

20:19.928 --> 20:23.598
Mrs. Salazar... please accept my offer.

20:24.432 --> 20:28.186
The next men who come...
won't be asking.

20:28.311 --> 20:30.146
There will be war.

20:34.651 --> 20:38.321
Why don't you ask my sons?
See what they think.

20:41.199 --> 20:45.203
If you don't mind, <i>Capitán,</i>
we need to stop by a friend's house.

20:47.372 --> 20:49.457
Make a right here.

20:53.419 --> 20:56.923
Nice neighbourhood.
Your friend's very wealthy.

20:58.508 --> 21:00.635
He's a very fortunate man.

21:09.060 --> 21:10.645
What is this?

21:12.647 --> 21:14.857
My friend likes chickens.

21:21.322 --> 21:23.324
- Colonel Martínez.
- Captain.

21:24.200 --> 21:28.037
- You know what's happening here?
- Yes, I think I know.

21:28.162 --> 21:30.498
I'm giving you one chance

21:30.623 --> 21:34.168
to do the right thing
and not fuck up this operation.

21:40.967 --> 21:43.386
You think you're clever?

21:43.511 --> 21:47.515
You're in Cali. Cali is my city.
This isn't Bogotá.

21:47.640 --> 21:50.226
You're way out of line here, Hugo.

21:51.936 --> 21:53.479
Perhaps.

22:05.742 --> 22:08.161
He's here. We'll find him.

22:10.872 --> 22:12.665
Watch him.

22:14.417 --> 22:16.919
You got your kid's drawing?

22:19.547 --> 22:21.758
I'm unarmed. I didn't come for a fight.

22:21.883 --> 22:24.344
We'll send your fucking head
to Miguel in a fucking box.

22:24.469 --> 22:27.138
- Walk, motherfucker.
- Let's go.

22:27.263 --> 22:29.307
Duvan!

22:29.432 --> 22:30.850
Duvan!

22:33.478 --> 22:35.396
Bring out the car.

22:35.521 --> 22:39.233
Pedro. Let's go. I'm taking you
to your mother. Take my hand.

22:40.651 --> 22:43.821
- Very good.
- Shut your fucking mouth or I kill her.

22:46.491 --> 22:49.702
All right, my lady.
Make like a statue or I shoot your ass.

22:49.827 --> 22:52.163
I'm getting in first, you hear?

22:52.288 --> 22:53.956
Real still.

22:54.082 --> 22:58.544
You're taking the boy.
What else do you want? Relax.

22:58.669 --> 23:00.671
- Stop!
- Mama!

23:00.797 --> 23:02.715
What else, motherfucker?

23:05.134 --> 23:06.636
Fucking asshole!

23:36.749 --> 23:38.167
Fuck!

24:42.899 --> 24:45.318
Drop the weapon.

24:50.781 --> 24:52.241
Drop the weapon.

24:57.079 --> 24:59.040
Don't shoot.

24:59.165 --> 25:01.250
I'm a man of peace.

25:20.520 --> 25:21.938
Let's go.

26:20.621 --> 26:22.206
Hey! Stop!

26:23.457 --> 26:25.293
Colonel! Calderón took off.

26:25.418 --> 26:28.045
- Fuck. We move fast.
- Okay.

26:31.924 --> 26:34.677
- Do you have a phone in there?
- Yes, in there.

26:44.270 --> 26:46.314
They got Gilberto and they're moving
towards the aerial base.

26:46.439 --> 26:48.274
The whole workforce is on this.

26:49.358 --> 26:54.155
'They're not going to leave the city.
Tell all the men to be alert. Understood?'

27:12.423 --> 27:14.842
Move it, asshole!

27:21.682 --> 27:24.477
They'll try to take us on the road.

27:24.602 --> 27:26.187
Guns out!

27:34.862 --> 27:36.072
Hello?

27:36.197 --> 27:38.115
'Don Miguel...

27:38.240 --> 27:40.409
- 'Something's happened.'
- What happened?

27:40.534 --> 27:45.706
I'm outside Gilberto's house.
They got him. They got your brother.

28:17.697 --> 28:21.534
'We've got a visual.'

28:23.244 --> 28:25.913
Surround him in the market!

28:36.424 --> 28:38.217
Tail him!

28:47.143 --> 28:49.562
Look! There he goes! Faster!

28:51.313 --> 28:53.149
Let's get him on the next turn!

28:59.113 --> 29:01.365
Hold your fire!

29:06.620 --> 29:10.291
Driver! Put your hands
where I can see them!

29:11.500 --> 29:12.501
Driver!

29:15.004 --> 29:16.338
Out further!

29:17.673 --> 29:18.924
Further!

29:26.891 --> 29:30.728
Get out. Open the back.

29:30.853 --> 29:33.814
- Okay. Let me get the keys.
- Open it.

29:47.787 --> 29:50.289
- Open it!
- Okay. All right. Settle.

30:01.300 --> 30:05.638
Those American sons of bitches tricked us.
We've got the wrong fucking truck!

30:05.763 --> 30:07.848
They're going to the air field.
We'll get them there.

30:09.141 --> 30:10.810
I took care of security.

30:10.935 --> 30:15.439
Let those sons of bitches
try to touch us again.

30:16.440 --> 30:19.360
Send Salcedo's beeper
another message.

30:35.751 --> 30:37.962
Uncle! It's me, Nicolas!

30:41.590 --> 30:43.008
Come in.

30:45.427 --> 30:47.263
- Nicolas.
- Uncle.

30:52.268 --> 30:54.395
- Is it true?
- Yes.

30:56.188 --> 30:58.357
They got him.

30:58.482 --> 31:01.110
Nicolas, why don't you go home
and wait there?

31:01.235 --> 31:03.404
Once something happens, I'll call you.

31:03.529 --> 31:05.531
No, sir, I have to help.

31:07.575 --> 31:09.159
Come.

31:09.285 --> 31:13.330
You know your dad doesn't
want you mixed up in this.

31:13.455 --> 31:16.458
We have to have faith that
your dad won't be taken out of Cali.

31:16.584 --> 31:20.588
And if he is? Why did we waste
all that money on my education?

31:20.713 --> 31:23.883
I'm a lawyer.
I'm taking the first flight to Bogotá.

31:24.008 --> 31:26.260
I want to help him.

31:26.385 --> 31:28.804
Let's hope that's not necessary.

32:26.695 --> 32:28.739
Fuck.

32:28.864 --> 32:30.199
Wait here.

32:37.831 --> 32:41.627
- 'Hey, boss. What's up?'
- There's cops surrounding the plane.

32:42.544 --> 32:44.546
'Cops? Good ones?'

32:45.547 --> 32:47.174
I don't think so.

32:48.634 --> 32:52.888
Colonel Martínez...
Sir, please don't come any closer.

32:53.013 --> 32:57.601
Your men are impeding the transport
and arrest of a fugitive under warrant.

32:59.311 --> 33:02.439
You know it.
And that means prison.

33:07.361 --> 33:09.196
What you do today...

33:10.698 --> 33:12.533
...what you do this moment...

33:13.575 --> 33:16.996
...defines you
for the rest of your lives.

33:22.710 --> 33:24.837
Are you police or not?

33:33.762 --> 33:35.264
That's better.

34:15.971 --> 34:17.723
Home stretch.

34:40.037 --> 34:41.538
Shit!

34:45.375 --> 34:47.252
'What's up? It's me.'

34:47.377 --> 34:50.130
- About fucking time.
- 'I was out of range.'

34:50.255 --> 34:52.091
'They arrested Gilberto.'

34:53.634 --> 34:57.471
- What?
- They got him, Jorge. They got Gilberto.

34:59.932 --> 35:03.602
- You were monitoring the raid.
- 'But they never mentioned Gilberto's name.'

35:03.727 --> 35:07.564
Even so, we checked
all the tapes. It's impossible.

35:09.691 --> 35:11.777
It doesn't make sense!

35:12.611 --> 35:14.488
I just don't understand!

35:14.613 --> 35:18.700
Brother... they got him.
They took him away.

35:19.618 --> 35:21.245
We got beat.

35:21.370 --> 35:23.372
Get back here quick.

35:30.003 --> 35:31.880
Hasta la vista, baby. Ciao.

35:46.603 --> 35:48.355
Take that.

35:58.240 --> 36:00.492
Five seconds to take photos, no more.

36:00.617 --> 36:02.536
Congratulations.

36:02.661 --> 36:05.164
But you know this won't hold up.

36:05.289 --> 36:08.917
You're fucking with things
that are much bigger than you are.

36:11.044 --> 36:14.882
Smile, Gilberto.
You're about to be on TV.

36:18.051 --> 36:19.428
This way, Mr. Rodríguez!

36:19.553 --> 36:22.431
Mr. Rodríguez, do you have a response
to the charges against you?

36:22.556 --> 36:25.225
Conspiring to export cocaine
and illegal enrichment?

36:25.350 --> 36:26.643
Enough. Let's go.

36:26.768 --> 36:30.981
Do you have anything to say
to the people of Cali? Mr. Rodríguez.

36:37.237 --> 36:40.490
'For those of us
who thought the surrender was bullshit,

36:40.616 --> 36:44.453
'Gilberto's arrest proved
that these guys could be caught.

36:44.578 --> 36:48.207
'For the people who thought the surrender
was the only way to avoid violence,

36:48.332 --> 36:50.500
'it was the beginning of a nightmare.

36:50.626 --> 36:54.796
'The first shot in a war
to bring down another cartel.

36:54.922 --> 36:58.842
'But whatever side you fell on,
one thing was clear:

36:58.967 --> 37:02.971
'Gilberto Rodríguez's arrest
came as a surprise to everybody.

37:05.057 --> 37:07.059
'Especially him.'

37:22.699 --> 37:24.534
Don Gilberto.

37:36.797 --> 37:38.173
Hey, congrats.

37:38.298 --> 37:40.592
Congratulations. Good work.

37:40.717 --> 37:43.470
No, where you going?
Come on, we want to toast you!

37:43.595 --> 37:45.264
Start without me.

37:51.520 --> 37:53.689
- Mr. Ambassador.
- Big day.

37:54.690 --> 37:57.734
- Quite a notch on your belt.
- It was strong intel, sir...

37:57.859 --> 37:59.611
Do you know how much work
you torched?

37:59.736 --> 38:03.156
The people want to see the godfathers
in handcuffs and that's what they'll get.

38:03.282 --> 38:07.119
- Front page of every newspaper tomorrow.
- Colombians may not feel that way.

38:09.371 --> 38:11.123
Let's go find out.

38:12.416 --> 38:14.293
Get changed.

38:23.719 --> 38:25.721
- My love!
- Mummy!

38:28.181 --> 38:29.725
Mummy.

38:29.850 --> 38:32.102
- Are you hungry? No?
- No.

38:33.645 --> 38:37.024
How cute. Looks a lot like his dad.

38:40.319 --> 38:43.280
Come on.
Mum'll read you a story in a bit.

38:43.405 --> 38:45.824
Go. I'll be right there.

38:46.533 --> 38:49.411
Thanks for showing up, Jorge.

38:53.957 --> 38:56.501
Sir, we don't know
how much the DEA knows.

38:56.626 --> 39:00.547
We need to assume
all your current homes are... unsafe.

39:03.133 --> 39:05.135
I'll stay here for now.

39:10.015 --> 39:12.142
We all need to talk.

39:15.187 --> 39:19.858
What did you expect? A warrant
by definition authorises the police...

39:19.983 --> 39:23.820
Wait. Let's not lie to ourselves.

39:23.945 --> 39:27.574
This operation was run
by the Drug Enforcement Administration

39:27.699 --> 39:29.076
of the United States.

39:29.201 --> 39:31.995
The takedown, Mr. Attorney General,
was National Police.

39:32.120 --> 39:36.625
The transport was by our police.
The booking was by our police.

39:36.750 --> 39:39.169
So a war started by National Police?

39:39.294 --> 39:41.505
Look, as Attorney General,

39:41.630 --> 39:47.094
my main... concern is achieving
a peaceful settlement with the godfathers.

39:47.219 --> 39:49.721
And the arrest
of Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela

39:49.846 --> 39:54.267
means we now have new leverage
to negotiate with.

39:54.393 --> 39:57.270
The President of Colombia,
Ernesto Samper.

40:02.901 --> 40:05.237
I hate to be late to a good debate.

40:05.362 --> 40:08.990
You know us, might as well try
to smooth rough water with a hammer.

40:12.035 --> 40:17.249
I've been apprised by Minister Botero
about our newly-incarcerated Cali godfather.

40:17.374 --> 40:21.211
- With all due respect, Mr. President...
- Go ahead, Miguel.

40:22.379 --> 40:26.133
We've worked for months
to negotiate this surrender.

40:27.342 --> 40:30.429
We recommend the immediate release
of Mr. Rodríguez Orejuela.

40:33.432 --> 40:37.727
Colombia is a nation of laws.
Not of concessions.

40:38.937 --> 40:42.691
If I give a pass to the largest criminal
organisation in the world,

40:42.816 --> 40:45.527
the trust of the people
will be lost forever.

40:48.280 --> 40:53.743
Mr. Rodríguez is entitled to the same
due process as any Colombian citizen.

40:53.869 --> 40:56.288
Let's see where due process gets him.

40:59.082 --> 41:00.417
For now...

41:02.085 --> 41:03.837
...his arrest stands.

41:05.005 --> 41:07.174
Thank you, gentlemen.

41:08.925 --> 41:10.760
Fuckin' A.

41:25.525 --> 41:27.486
Thank you very much.

41:59.726 --> 42:03.563
We talked about this.
I don't want the stink of this on you.

42:03.688 --> 42:05.106
Relax, Dad.

42:05.232 --> 42:09.236
I'm a lawyer. I'm the only one
in the family who can visit you.

42:12.572 --> 42:17.202
Besides, I thought
you could use a friendly face.

42:18.328 --> 42:22.374
What I could really use
is a tumbler of whiskey about this big.

42:28.171 --> 42:29.506
How's it look?

42:31.424 --> 42:33.426
The warrants are old.

42:34.886 --> 42:37.180
- Invalid?
- Vulnerable.

42:38.473 --> 42:42.060
I have a lunch tomorrow at 1:00pm
with the Colombian Board of Pharmacies.

42:42.185 --> 42:44.229
8:00am, latest, I'm out.

42:45.146 --> 42:48.149
Dad, you're here until our lawyers
get you in front of a judge.

42:48.817 --> 42:53.238
And he'll hold you here in Bogotá
due to the conspiracy charge.

42:54.948 --> 42:58.785
I don't get it.
This is a mistake, a blunder.

42:58.910 --> 43:02.539
A gross overstep
by a rogue American agent!

43:03.123 --> 43:05.166
That's what you want to believe.

43:05.292 --> 43:08.128
But if that was the case,
you'd be out by now.

43:10.714 --> 43:13.383
- Dad, this is real.
- No, money is real!

43:13.508 --> 43:15.510
What about all I've paid?

43:16.761 --> 43:20.098
Sons of bitches can't leave me
confined here!

43:23.518 --> 43:26.896
How the fuck did they surprise us
like that, gentlemen?

43:27.022 --> 43:28.565
It was Calderón.

43:31.026 --> 43:33.862
Dad, I say we tear him to pieces.

43:33.987 --> 43:38.325
- And his fucking family and his children.
- David, please.

43:38.450 --> 43:41.661
Obviously, there's responsibility
on all sides.

43:42.996 --> 43:45.957
- Cordova...
- Sir, just as we realised...

43:46.082 --> 43:47.626
By the time you realised,

43:47.751 --> 43:52.839
Colonel Martínez had already been
in my brother's house for 30 minutes.

43:52.964 --> 43:55.717
Don Miguel. The failure's mine.

43:55.842 --> 43:59.012
When it comes to the DEA,
Cordova counts on me.

44:00.889 --> 44:05.268
Wait. Cordova, you're my brother's
personal head of security.

44:06.728 --> 44:10.649
- Yes, sir.
- Then you should've been there.

44:11.941 --> 44:15.403
Your men should've been there.

44:16.571 --> 44:20.950
Your guards were fooled
by a fucking chicken truck!

44:22.911 --> 44:25.163
I want to know what the fuck
is happening here.

44:25.288 --> 44:31.294
Because I'm starting to believe
that none of us is safe.

44:32.420 --> 44:34.464
Not your families...

44:37.884 --> 44:39.552
...and not mine.

44:40.220 --> 44:41.805
My family.

44:47.268 --> 44:50.689
Thank you, Attorney General Valdivieso,
Defence Minister Botero.

44:52.691 --> 44:55.276
Today marks an important beginning,

44:55.402 --> 44:57.320
an important victory.

44:57.445 --> 45:00.990
Because of the success
of our Colombian-American operation,

45:01.116 --> 45:03.660
the Cali cartel is on the run.

45:03.785 --> 45:08.248
And with the continued support
of the Colombian National Police,

45:08.373 --> 45:13.086
I promise you
the other three godfathers will fall.

45:15.255 --> 45:17.006
'Questions?'

45:17.132 --> 45:20.427
That's as much recognition
as we can hope for, right?

45:24.305 --> 45:27.475
None at all? Smart move.

45:27.600 --> 45:29.561
Keep his face all over this
while we're closing in.

45:30.979 --> 45:33.022
Kiss-ass.

45:34.983 --> 45:36.359
Want some?

45:37.485 --> 45:38.945
No, I'm moving tables.

45:39.070 --> 45:40.405
Oh, boy.

45:41.865 --> 45:45.285
Oh, God.
Can't believe you're eating that shit.

46:16.483 --> 46:19.527
- Colonel, please.
- Thanks.

46:21.488 --> 46:24.240
Have a drink with me.

46:25.992 --> 46:28.828
Tonight, we celebrate.

46:30.079 --> 46:32.081
Tomorrow, we go back to work.

46:35.752 --> 46:37.837
Well, not for me.

46:38.880 --> 46:40.882
What are you talking about?

46:41.007 --> 46:44.969
You remember those papers
that were seized by your men in Cali?

46:45.887 --> 46:48.097
Yeah, we never saw those.

46:48.973 --> 46:50.934
Apparently, Vargas did.

46:51.059 --> 46:54.854
There was a list of cops who've
been accepting money from Cali.

46:55.855 --> 46:59.359
One name he was eager
to share: mine.

47:01.861 --> 47:04.906
Those son of a bitches
want to discredit Gilberto's arrest.

47:05.031 --> 47:09.118
Exactly. It sends a message
to any cop who wants to try what we did.

47:18.211 --> 47:20.839
I turned in my weapon and my badge.

47:24.175 --> 47:25.718
Good luck.

47:26.636 --> 47:28.221
Colonel...

47:30.515 --> 47:31.933
I'm sorry.

47:38.773 --> 47:43.736
Men like me would give our lives
to arrest a man like him.

47:46.030 --> 47:48.867
You did everything right, Peña.

47:48.992 --> 47:51.202
But now you're all alone.

47:54.163 --> 47:55.915
Take care.

48:22.734 --> 48:25.194
We need to talk about your security.

48:27.405 --> 48:29.407
Let me be in charge.

48:30.783 --> 48:32.785
I'll protect you, Dad.

48:35.705 --> 48:38.625
Now's not the time for a change.

48:43.838 --> 48:47.717
We need to keep things on track
until your uncle is back.

48:52.013 --> 48:54.223
What if he doesn't come back?

49:08.529 --> 49:10.740
Jorge?

49:10.865 --> 49:12.241
Jorge.

49:29.008 --> 49:31.344
- They got Gilberto.
- 'I don't understand.

49:31.469 --> 49:34.472
I thought Gilberto had this
all under control.

49:34.597 --> 49:36.265
'So did I.'

49:37.976 --> 49:40.937
- And what now?
- 'This could get messy.

49:41.062 --> 49:46.025
'Stay where you are.
Right now, we look out for ourselves.

49:46.150 --> 49:48.695
'Pacho... be smart.'

49:51.489 --> 49:55.994
For now, we wait.
You stay there a while longer.

49:56.119 --> 49:58.746
We have to keep everything running.

49:59.622 --> 50:05.586
'The health of the business has never
been more important. Understand?'

50:05.712 --> 50:07.130
Yes. Of course.

50:10.425 --> 50:12.427
You listening to me, motherfucker?

50:13.970 --> 50:16.389
Hey, listen, buddy,
I don't speak Spanish.

50:17.890 --> 50:19.684
No speak Spanish.

50:20.852 --> 50:24.022
Okay. Have a nice day.

50:54.969 --> 50:57.513
Hey, boss. Good day today, huh?

50:57.638 --> 50:59.265
The Jurado tapes.

50:59.390 --> 51:03.144
We probably shouldn't call them that
because they're not legal, per se.

51:03.269 --> 51:05.188
I want all of them.
