10:34.978 --> 10:37.479
On the verge of
making the same mistake...

10:37.514 --> 10:38.880
as you did. Ah, come on, man.

10:38.915 --> 10:40.715
You don't think I
haven't heard this before?

10:40.751 --> 10:42.825
You just another dusty-ass street prophet.

10:43.453 --> 10:46.388
Every fool-ass convict
come through that door

10:46.423 --> 10:48.690
think that they Laurence Fishburne

10:48.725 --> 10:50.025
in "Boyz N the Hood."

10:50.135 --> 10:52.193
Then they find out the 'hood gone.

10:52.229 --> 10:54.162
Man, the neighborhood's been gentrified.

10:54.197 --> 10:56.126
What you need to be concerned with

10:56.266 --> 10:58.933
is getting caught in some recidivism.

10:58.969 --> 10:59.934
Some what?

10:59.970 --> 11:01.490
Re-cid-ivism.

11:01.491 --> 11:02.871
Recidivism.

11:03.763 --> 11:05.110
That's what I said.

11:06.576 --> 11:08.639
Fine. Come on, let's take a walk, man.

11:09.312 --> 11:11.913
Ah, don't you put your
hand in [BLEEP] candy corn.

11:11.948 --> 11:13.248
Don't touch my shit.

11:13.517 --> 11:15.684
At the same time, we need
to, spiritually speaking...

11:15.719 --> 11:17.252
- Okay.
- Focus on how we contribute

11:17.287 --> 11:18.520
- two cents...
- Here they go.

11:18.555 --> 11:20.055
Here they go right here. This is exactly

11:20.090 --> 11:21.356
what I'm talking about, Barker.

11:21.391 --> 11:23.124
Too many mentors. Not enough mentees.

11:23.160 --> 11:24.726
Jaybird, Felony, meet Tray.

11:24.761 --> 11:25.727
- 'Sup?
- 'Sup?

11:25.762 --> 11:27.429
'Sup? I look forward to guiding y'all

11:27.464 --> 11:28.863
on your personal journeys.

11:28.899 --> 11:30.565
You can guide me, but
you can walk with me...

11:30.600 --> 11:32.267
But what is a journey but a
beginning, middle, and end...

11:32.302 --> 11:33.635
Shut the [BLEEP] up. Come on.

11:33.670 --> 11:36.971
This is the barracks.
You're bunk number five.

11:37.145 --> 11:40.141
Name's Erwin, but everybody
call me Big Country.

11:40.177 --> 11:41.342
Big Country?

11:41.376 --> 11:42.711
Well, we gonna have to swap bunks, man.

11:42.746 --> 11:44.179
I'm not trying to die tonight.

11:44.214 --> 11:45.980
You're funny, man.

11:46.016 --> 11:48.650
Funny? What the hell? You
want to hear some funny?

11:48.685 --> 11:50.485
All right, I got a good
one for you right here.

11:50.520 --> 11:53.571
What's the difference between
a hard-on and a Bugatti?

11:54.925 --> 11:56.558
I don't have a Bugatti.

12:00.372 --> 12:02.697
You mean to tell me you
got an erection right now?

12:02.733 --> 12:04.332
No. You know what?

12:04.367 --> 12:06.601
You got one week to find a
job, otherwise, you outta here.

12:06.636 --> 12:08.002
I ain't got no damn erection.

12:08.038 --> 12:09.604
Ask me about no erection.

12:09.639 --> 12:12.107
If that thing lasts more than
four hours, call a doctor.

12:12.142 --> 12:14.498
What up, Big Country?

12:14.523 --> 12:15.845
What's up, Tray?

12:59.181 --> 13:01.351
I cried for days in my cell, man.

13:03.693 --> 13:04.971
I should have been there.

you'd probably say some shit like...

Fredo!

13:39.178 --> 13:40.272
What's that?

13:40.297 --> 13:41.817
Michael killed Fredo, his own brother.

That's what made him badder,
you know what I'm saying?

13:44.277 --> 13:47.018
You remember asking me who
was badder in "Godfather,"

13:47.019 --> 13:48.157
Michael or Vito.

13:48.989 --> 13:50.317
- I remember.
- Yeah.

13:51.257 --> 13:52.724
That's when he became a villain.

13:53.627 --> 13:56.193
You never sacrifice
your family for the life.

13:56.430 --> 13:58.206
Yeah, that's real right there, son.

13:59.785 --> 14:02.200
The last time I saw you, you were...

Yeah, now look at you, man.

14:05.405 --> 14:07.939
Looking like a broke-ass
Tupac... One-pac.

14:07.975 --> 14:09.507
Oh, oh, okay.

14:09.543 --> 14:11.977
All right, well, um, you the
one out here looking elderly.

14:12.012 --> 14:13.411
- No.
- Looking like

14:13.447 --> 14:15.280
you passing out from calcium deficiency.

14:15.315 --> 14:17.115
You looking like Sgt. Slaughter's

14:17.150 --> 14:18.316
illegitimate son.

14:18.352 --> 14:20.778
You look like, uh, Chicken George

14:21.054 --> 14:23.088
at the end of "Roots."

14:23.123 --> 14:24.856
You got one arm longer than the other,

14:24.891 --> 14:26.191
and you clap like this.

14:26.226 --> 14:28.593
Oh, okay. So, is that you?

14:28.629 --> 14:30.821
- 'Cause you smell so bad...
- Shut up, man!

14:30.878 --> 14:32.258
I got a gland problem.

14:33.834 --> 14:35.000
My... My bad.

I thought you outgrow that type of stuff.

14:37.237 --> 14:39.070
I ain't... I ain't...

14:39.106 --> 14:40.191

14:40.706 --> 14:42.239
Well, you know, I'm

14:42.273 --> 14:44.655
You know, business been

You gonna end up in prison, Bobby.

14:48.754 --> 14:50.654
Look, ain't nobody scared of jail.

14:50.689 --> 14:52.723
Look, I know mad people in there.

14:52.758 --> 14:54.658
Plus, all they do is rap and work out.

14:54.823 --> 14:58.464
In prison, as pretty as you
are, you would be a perfect 10.

14:59.809 --> 15:00.931
Thank you, man.

15:00.966 --> 15:03.282
That's... that's not good, Bobby.

15:03.536 --> 15:06.904
They will turn your butthole
into a parking garage.

15:07.056 --> 15:09.506
Start putting all kind
of cars in there, man.

15:09.542 --> 15:12.859
Buicks, Cutlass Sierras, Oldsmobiles.

15:13.345 --> 15:15.078
Somebody gonna put a Hummer in there.

15:15.114 --> 15:16.847
You don't want nobody
parking no Hummer in there.

15:16.882 --> 15:18.749
- I don't want no Hummer.
- No, man.

15:18.784 --> 15:20.918
You don't want your rectum turned into

15:20.953 --> 15:22.085
a parking garage, man.

15:22.121 --> 15:23.381
That's not what you want.

15:24.247 --> 15:26.634
You don't want nobody parking
no Hummer in there, man.

15:27.560 --> 15:28.967
This is my neighborhood, man.

15:29.361 --> 15:30.547
Things done changed.

15:31.199 --> 15:32.991
Just like "Planet of the Apes," man.

15:34.029 --> 15:35.172
Weird.

15:35.631 --> 15:39.001
Like when Zira was talking
to Dr. Zaius, and she said,

15:39.091 --> 15:41.302
"What do you think they'll
find out there, Doctor?"

15:41.303 --> 15:43.470
And he said, "Their destiny."

15:45.674 --> 15:47.341
The worst part is with Shay, man.

15:47.376 --> 15:49.146
She done moved on and got a new man.

15:49.171 --> 15:50.678
Hey, what is you talking about?

15:50.713 --> 15:53.385
What happened to the dude
that I knew, that I idolized?

15:53.716 --> 15:55.681
You Big Tray Diesel, man.

15:55.682 --> 15:57.274

16:36.284 --> 16:37.884
These are our friends.

Our family members.

16:53.168 --> 16:54.779
You tell 'em, Shay!

16:55.621 --> 16:58.321
We've already raised enough money to buy

You're welcome.

17:13.979 --> 17:15.459

17:20.285 --> 17:22.142
That was quite the speech, Shannon.

17:22.183 --> 17:23.554
So articulate.

17:23.884 --> 17:25.751
You should think about politics.

17:32.693 --> 17:34.174
you know, even though
you didn't come visit me,

17:34.273 --> 17:36.057
15 years I was incarcerated,

17:36.708 --> 17:37.893

Come here and give me some love.

17:43.571 --> 17:46.769
Tray, you are quite the funny man.

17:47.158 --> 17:49.092
You know, he's one of our former homeless.

17:51.629 --> 17:52.843
Indeed.

Nigga,

you can crash my event.

18:04.909 --> 18:06.082
How dare you!

18:06.199 --> 18:07.805
Damn, hello to you, too.

18:08.613 --> 18:11.549
- Shannon?
- I tried to stop him, Shannon.

18:12.383 --> 18:13.983
Everything good? You okay?

18:14.187 --> 18:16.321

gonna send her to you soon.

- Yeah?

Sweetie bear, please wait for me inside.

18:24.834 --> 18:26.634
Yeah, go on in and have
some of that pink stuff.

18:26.669 --> 18:27.902
It looked delicious.

18:27.937 --> 18:29.737
- I got this.
- Hey, I'm watching you.

18:29.772 --> 18:31.486
I'm watching you, too, mangina.

18:31.774 --> 18:33.365
I am not a mangina.

18:33.676 --> 18:35.210
I'm just a regular man.

18:47.557 --> 18:48.522
Hell no!

18:48.558 --> 18:49.657
There's the old Shay.

18:49.692 --> 18:51.926
I got by Shannon now, not Shay.

18:51.961 --> 18:53.961
You calling yourself by
your government name now?

18:53.996 --> 18:57.531
Bitch, do you know how hard I had to work

18:57.567 --> 18:58.966
to pull myself up out the gutter?

18:59.001 --> 19:00.568
How long did it take for you to marry

19:00.603 --> 19:01.569
that white man in there?

19:01.604 --> 19:03.082
Josh is a good man.

19:03.873 --> 19:05.673

19:05.708 --> 19:06.974
Yeah, but do you love him, though?

19:07.009 --> 19:08.215
Yes, I do.

19:14.615 --> 19:15.635

19:15.850 --> 19:17.772
Amira's trying to poison me with peanuts.

19:17.797 --> 19:19.518

19:19.554 --> 19:22.588
Amira, Shahzad, go inside
with your father now.

19:22.918 --> 19:24.384
Are you okay? I'm fine.

19:24.420 --> 19:26.505
Go inside right now.

19:31.575 --> 19:32.726
Tray, I know what you want to say.

19:32.761 --> 19:34.142
How old are they?

19:34.296 --> 19:35.662
- 15.
- Twins?

19:35.868 --> 19:37.998
- Tray...
- Scientifically speaking,

19:38.033 --> 19:40.701
how did you and a
Caucasian man make two kids

19:40.736 --> 19:42.970

Good night, Shannon!

19:45.334 --> 19:47.641
Good night, Mr. and Mrs. Washington.

19:47.676 --> 19:49.176
Your support is appreciated.

19:49.211 --> 19:52.746
When I get home, I'm going to
write you a very large check!

19:52.781 --> 19:54.581
Oh, you are so kind.

19:55.976 --> 19:57.442
Listen to me, Tray.

19:57.477 --> 19:59.381
Those kids didn't grow
up the way that we did.

19:59.406 --> 20:01.888
They got nice friends.
They go to a nice school.

20:01.913 --> 20:03.929
If those are my kids, I deserve to know.

20:12.376 --> 20:13.901
Look, I told you not to leave.

20:14.127 --> 20:15.927
I told you not to go out
there and sell that rock,

20:15.962 --> 20:17.305
but you went, anyway.

20:17.573 --> 20:18.839
You could have gave them Wavy.

20:18.874 --> 20:19.909
I don't snitch.

20:19.910 --> 20:22.144
And that's why I didn't tell
you about the kids, Tray.

20:22.178 --> 20:24.612
Because wherever you go, you bring chaos!

20:24.647 --> 20:25.855
I don't bring chaos!

20:25.856 --> 20:26.856
Yes, you do!
