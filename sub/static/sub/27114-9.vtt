I keep reading articles that
the Feds is investigating Shotti

00:13.381 --> 00:15.114

If you give me the
chance to, all right,
I'll make you a star.

00:25.793 --> 00:29.161
I was charged
with aggravated assault,

00:29.230 --> 00:31.663
so I gotta go to court

00:31.732 --> 00:36.201
and there is a possibility
that I will do jail time.

the foster care system,

00:42.443 --> 00:44.309
so I brought her
to my house.

00:44.378 --> 00:46.311
The judge approved
the process

00:46.380 --> 00:48.914
for me becoming
a foster mother.

00:48.983 --> 00:51.617
I got a bigger surprise.
What?

00:51.685 --> 00:55.888
Daddy's coming home.
Aah!

00:55.956 --> 00:58.624
I want to spend this time
that we do have together

00:58.692 --> 01:02.127

more than we've ever
loved each other.

01:02.196 --> 01:05.197
We are gonna do
a whole makeover, bitch.

Hey, Sidney.
Hi.
Hello.

Oh, I see you have

Very beautiful.
Thank you.
You too.

through the room, bitch,

02:46.200 --> 02:48.667

No, hold on.

02:48.736 --> 02:50.936
Hey!
Let's rewind.

02:51.005 --> 02:53.338
We cannot start
with the same energy

02:53.407 --> 02:54.773
that you did
the last time, sis.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.308
What happened?
What'd I miss?
Fill me in.

02:56.377 --> 03:01.346
So, I'm a wild child.
I have a lot going on
in my life.

03:01.415 --> 03:03.482
I'm a transgender female.
Okay.

03:03.551 --> 03:06.885
And I became really good
friends with Nya

03:06.954 --> 03:10.856
and she has
given me clothes.
Aww!

03:10.925 --> 03:14.226
Clothes she could have gave
someone, like, that was
homeless instead of me.

03:14.295 --> 03:17.496
Ooh! Ooh! Wait, did y'all
fight or something?

03:17.565 --> 03:20.199
They got into it
because it was...
Almost.
Oh, no!

03:20.267 --> 03:23.035
She was, you know...
got really mad at me.
I did this.

03:23.103 --> 03:27.339
You did a lot of stuff, sis.
Girl, flinching
to a hood girl is like...

03:27.408 --> 03:29.641
In New York, you don't
play like that. That's
what I'm telling you.

03:29.710 --> 03:32.511
But the thing is,
I didn't think she would
be threatened like that.

03:32.580 --> 03:37.482
People coming at me
at my womanhood, that's
a huge trigger for me

03:37.551 --> 03:40.519
and I really felt like
that's what Nya was doing.

03:40.588 --> 03:43.789
I feel like she was
trying to tell me that's
not how women dress.

03:43.857 --> 03:48.060
It basically offended
me and I was just
a bitch about it.

03:48.128 --> 03:51.663
I should not have came
at her the way I did,

03:51.732 --> 03:55.100
walked in your makeup place
like I owned the place.

03:55.169 --> 03:59.204
I was wrong
and I'm so sorry.
I take... I swear.

03:59.273 --> 04:01.773
Sorry.
Sis, listen, I swear.

04:01.842 --> 04:04.509
I'm so sorry, like...
Okay, so I take
your apology.

04:04.578 --> 04:07.879
I 100% receive it.
I don't know that Nya will.

04:07.948 --> 04:11.450
I don't think Nya was coming
for Sidney's womanhood,

04:11.518 --> 04:16.388
but if that's how Sidney took
it, then I understand why she
reacted the way that she did.

04:16.457 --> 04:19.157
I honestly just wish she
would have explained it Nya

04:19.226 --> 04:22.027
the way she's explaining it
to Mariahlynn right now.

04:22.096 --> 04:25.797
So I have a friend upstate.
They have, like, this
beautiful winery

04:25.866 --> 04:27.733
and it's a beautiful
vineyard.
I love wine.

04:27.801 --> 04:30.002
So I want to set up,
like, a beautiful event.

04:30.070 --> 04:31.737
If you come with
this energy, Sidney,

04:31.805 --> 04:33.772
I know Nya.
She's gonna listen.

04:33.841 --> 04:36.208
And I hope you guys
can fix the situation.

04:36.277 --> 04:38.977
Hi!
I won't shut you out.

04:39.046 --> 04:40.312
Hey, sis!
Hi, guys!

04:40.381 --> 04:42.481
This is my doctor.

04:42.549 --> 04:47.419
If it's good for my career,
I'm all for trying to make
things right with Nya.

04:47.488 --> 04:51.657
At the end of the day,
I am trying to make it big
in this music industry

04:51.725 --> 04:54.760
so I can afford the money
for my sex change,

04:54.828 --> 04:59.064

is way more important to me

04:59.133 --> 05:02.367

You had us waiting.

Ah!
Hi!

11:22.282 --> 11:23.982
It's always nice
to get out of the city,

11:24.051 --> 11:27.786
so I decided to take my girls
upstate to a winery.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.988
I just want us all
to let loose, have fun,

11:30.057 --> 11:34.325
and hopefully in the process,
Nya and Sidney can work our
their differences.

Now that I hear that Sidney's
upset because she feels like Nya
was attacking her womanhood,

11:38.732 --> 11:40.932
I kind of understand
where she's coming from,

11:41.001 --> 11:44.135
but I didn't tell Nya
'cause she's still hot
about the makeup class

11:44.204 --> 11:46.838

would not have come.

11:46.907 --> 11:48.940
How are you?
You girls look delish!

11:49.009 --> 11:51.476

Thank you.
Are you super excited?

Yes, I am.
I am. Good vibe.

What I really wanted to do
was, like, go out there,

stomp grapes,
like the whole shebang.
Yeah, I would give it here
for an "I Love Lucy" moment.

13:48.562 --> 13:49.861
Right! Right!

13:49.930 --> 13:53.031
I'm so glad Jonathan invited me
to come with you guys

I heard that Sidney threw
Nya's dress on the floor.

Just a whole bunch
of crazy things.

14:13.620 --> 14:15.253
You know, I'm not gonna lie.
I'm a little concerned

14:15.322 --> 14:17.255
that all these different people
are in the same room

14:17.324 --> 14:19.691

be around people that

14:35.742 --> 14:38.209
are gonna try to test
my (bleep) gangster.

14:38.278 --> 14:42.347
Nya was trying to give me
clothes to change my style.

14:42.415 --> 14:46.517
She was basically saying
that I dress like trash.

14:46.586 --> 14:50.521
So I took the dress
that she gave me.

14:50.590 --> 14:55.193
I got that bitch tailored.
I changed it up,
sluttied it out.

14:55.262 --> 14:59.430
I Sidney Starred that
dress. Nya just felt
disrespected, I guess.

And then I did this.
I flinched.
What the (bleep) is that?

15:03.837 --> 15:06.871
I flinched.
You can't do that if you
don't know how to fight.

15:06.940 --> 15:11.476
If Nya was just some
random chick that
wasn't in the industry,

15:11.544 --> 15:16.180
I'd probably tell that bitch
to kick rocks, but honestly,

She says that she wants
to evolve and she wants
people to respect her,

15:37.137 --> 15:40.438

things and making yourself
someone to be respected.
Right

the only other support

21:13.172 --> 21:15.306
Bitch, I have yet
to see a grape.

21:15.375 --> 21:17.875
That's a (bleep) grape!
(laughs)

21:17.944 --> 21:19.744
This is what the (bleep)
you brought me over here for?

21:19.812 --> 21:23.014
This was it, guys. Three hours
and this is what we've got,

21:23.082 --> 21:26.384
three micro-balls.
I dare you
to try it.

21:26.452 --> 21:29.186
Let's just enjoy the
vineyard. Let's have fun.

21:29.255 --> 21:31.555
You stay a little bit
on your side, I stay a
little bit on my side,

21:31.624 --> 21:33.958
and let (bleep) happen
naturally.
But can't you see
that I care, though?

21:34.027 --> 21:37.628
I hear it with the
actions, but let's
just go over here.

21:37.697 --> 21:40.865
No hugs, bitch.
Uh-uh, no hugs.
Not yet. Uh-uh.

21:40.933 --> 21:44.001
Mm-mm. Jonathan,
get your friend,
Jonathan.

is exactly why we
traveled three hours.

What the (bleep)?
Hi, Frank.
How are you?

21:56.883 --> 21:59.884
Welcome to the
Clearview Vineyard.

21:59.952 --> 22:00.985
Thank you so much
for having us.

22:01.054 --> 22:02.486
Hi, Frank!
Well, hi!

22:02.555 --> 22:04.822
We're gonna have you
dump the grapes in here

22:04.891 --> 22:09.360
and you're gonna do it
the old-fashioned way by
stomping on the grapes.

22:09.429 --> 22:12.596
A lot of my friends
have very big
and ample bottoms,

22:12.665 --> 22:14.131
so we might want to do
two or three at a time.

22:14.200 --> 22:16.534
We might even want
to do one with all
these asses.

22:16.602 --> 22:19.837
I'm going in.

22:19.906 --> 22:21.906
Don't they gotta wash
they feet first?

22:21.974 --> 22:23.974
No, bitch,
my feet are pedicured.

22:24.043 --> 22:25.943
I gotta make sure
my tuck don't come loose.

22:26.012 --> 22:28.679

22:28.748 --> 22:30.981
These bitches just jumped in,
no pedicure.

Now, what wine I'ma taste?
I'm not drinking that.

22:35.588 --> 22:38.522
Okay, Mariah, stomp,
stomp, stomp them hos.

22:38.591 --> 22:40.491
Stomp 'em.
Stomp them hos.

22:40.560 --> 22:43.427
You know, I don't do
random groups of people.

22:43.496 --> 22:46.764
Oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, ooh.

22:46.833 --> 22:51.402
But, you know, this is a
Jonathan event, so it is
a little bit to be expected.

22:51.471 --> 22:54.405
It's kind of like you
gotta be about it when
you around Jonathan.

22:54.474 --> 22:57.808
You're gonna give
Frank a surprise.
(laughs)

22:57.877 --> 23:00.478
Frank's
gonna get a frank.

23:00.546 --> 23:04.281
I'm having a good time
at the vineyard catching up
with some of these ladies

23:04.350 --> 23:08.419
that I don't always get to
mingle with, like Kimbella.

23:08.488 --> 23:12.323
I've heard that her and Yandy
are on the outs.

23:12.392 --> 23:15.025
Y'all know my nosy ass
wants to know the tea.

23:15.094 --> 23:17.528
It's so good to see you.
I know.
Good to see you too.

23:17.597 --> 23:20.931
We never get
to leak, ever.
We never get
to hang out, girl.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.667
I always see you with,
like, you know, the Yandys

23:23.736 --> 23:26.871
and I'm like, oh, okay.
Yeah, no. That's--
That's no more.

23:26.939 --> 23:29.173
Oh, no?
No, no. I can't
do it no more.

23:29.242 --> 23:32.009
You know, we're no
longer friends and...
Yeah, 'cause honestly,

23:32.078 --> 23:33.944
I'm not gonna lie, like,
my whole thing is like,

23:34.013 --> 23:38.516
I see on social media
she adopted, um,
a little girl.

23:38.584 --> 23:42.453
At first I'm like, wow,
that's so dope that
she's doing that.

23:42.522 --> 23:45.389
But is it for the
right reasons? Because,
she likes to, like,

23:45.458 --> 23:49.960
portray, you know,
her life to be this
holier than thou...

23:50.029 --> 23:56.834
Whoo, child. That's all I
can say, because I know her
better than a lot of people

23:56.903 --> 23:58.669
and for sure, listen...

24:00.807 --> 24:04.508
I feel like Yandy's definitely
doing this for the wrong reason.

24:04.577 --> 24:07.311
Everything is about image
and putting on a show.

24:07.380 --> 24:09.847
I was in the system myself
so I know what it's like

24:09.916 --> 24:12.349
to be a young girl
looking for a mother's love,

24:12.418 --> 24:16.220
so you know what I'm saying?
And it's like, I would
really hate to see

24:16.289 --> 24:21.325
that maybe a year or two
from now, she gives up on
her and gives her back.
Damn.

24:21.394 --> 24:25.229
You know what I'm saying?
'Cause I've been that kid
to been gived back.

24:25.298 --> 24:29.066
Yandy and I have always
been cordial, but I
think she's rubbing me

24:29.135 --> 24:31.702
a little the wrong way
with this foster care thing.

24:31.771 --> 24:35.639
Yandy's been posting
all over the Internet,
doing interviews,

24:35.708 --> 24:38.242
all on the blogs
with this young lady,

24:38.311 --> 24:43.414
and as a former
foster care kid myself,
it offends me to the fullest

24:43.483 --> 24:46.383
if she's not doing this
for the right reasons.

24:46.452 --> 24:49.453
Bitch, when I tell you
Frank is a hoot...
Frank?

24:49.522 --> 24:51.121
This is a hoot
right here.
This one.

24:51.190 --> 24:52.957
It just--
too much entertainment.

24:53.025 --> 24:56.560
And I actually feel
like me and Nya are
kind of getting closer.

24:56.629 --> 24:59.063
(overlapping chatter)

24:59.131 --> 25:02.333
Not even baby steps.
I need, like, little
kicks in the womb.

25:02.401 --> 25:06.203
We not even outside yet.
I really miss
your friendship.

25:06.272 --> 25:08.706
I really... You are...
You were just so nice to me

25:08.774 --> 25:09.974
in such of a short
period of time.

25:10.042 --> 25:12.209
Why you flinching at bitches
that are nice to you?

25:12.278 --> 25:17.915
Okay, I flinched at you
because it was a way for
you to kind of shut up.

25:17.984 --> 25:20.651
That's really
the only thing...
Oh, my...

25:20.720 --> 25:23.420
But I... I...
It wasn't to fight you.

25:23.489 --> 25:25.155
We trying to make
it to the next
thing or we not?

25:25.224 --> 25:28.025
Because right now...
Nya, didn't you
ask me for the truth?

25:28.094 --> 25:30.828
Yeah. So you thought
that you bucking
your chest up at me

25:30.897 --> 25:33.764
was gonna make me
shut the (bleep) up.
That's the problem.

25:33.833 --> 25:37.268
Babe, you can't tell
people, "I wanted you
to shut the (bleep) up."
(laughs)

25:37.336 --> 25:40.304
Please give me
a third chance. I promise
I won't (bleep) up.

25:40.373 --> 25:43.674
A third?
A third chance?
(laughs)

25:43.743 --> 25:46.644
Bitch, you said you put
your chest out to tell me
to shut the (bleep) up.

25:46.712 --> 25:49.113
Like I said before,
do you want to get
beat the (bleep) up?

25:49.181 --> 25:50.748
Uh!
No.
Do you want that?

25:50.816 --> 25:52.082
So then, shut
the (bleep) up.

25:52.151 --> 25:53.484
Don't say nothin' else
to me. How about that?

25:53.553 --> 25:56.987
Why is she pressing Nya?
That's not how you apologize.

25:57.056 --> 25:59.523
It was weird. It was like,
bitch, take my apology.

25:59.592 --> 26:01.926
You grow and you
evolve and then they
come and try you.

26:01.994 --> 26:03.894
Like, I'm not gonna
keep making threats.
I'm gonna act.

26:03.963 --> 26:07.231
It was going good 'til
you said, "I wanted you to
shut the (bleep) up," babe.

26:07.300 --> 26:09.800
Mama!
Nya, I'm sor... I'm sorry.
I did not mean it.

26:09.869 --> 26:11.869
I don't want to hear
what she has to say.

to be my friend.
I don't want to hear
what the (bleep) you
got to say, bitch!

your chest out to me...
Aah!

26:17.443 --> 26:19.510

...one more (bleep) time,
I'm gonna smack

she don't fit,

right now is pure bullying.

is when it comes to family,
you don't get involved.

I think that you should take
Yandy with a salt of grain.

that you should...
You don't like
Yandy either?

things for a look,

Mm! Uh!

I didn't even know Mariah
had an issue with Yandy,

28:50.162 --> 28:52.062
and to be honest,
it's very disrespectful

28:52.131 --> 28:55.299

and Kimbella to be sitting here,

28:55.367 --> 28:57.901

I know Jonathan
doesn't want to hear it.

29:15.287 --> 29:18.489
I was always defending
Yandy as well, so I get it.

29:18.557 --> 29:21.158
And one day, you will
understand as well, Jonathan,

29:21.227 --> 29:25.763
she's definitely not to be
trusted and she definitely lies

29:25.831 --> 29:28.098
and she definitely
puts on a front.

29:28.167 --> 29:29.500
I said what I said
and I mean what I mean.

29:29.568 --> 29:31.235
That's all I got to say
about it.

29:31.303 --> 29:33.837
This really bothers me
because if I had to
pick a side,

29:33.906 --> 29:35.773
and I will say this
to her if I need to,

29:35.841 --> 29:38.342
I'm always gonna
pick Yandy's side.
Bitch, you saying that

29:38.410 --> 29:40.344
like you gonna choose
her over me type (bleep).

29:40.412 --> 29:42.312
This has absolutely
nothing to do with you.

29:42.381 --> 29:44.748
How you feel about
Yandy is how you
feel about Yandy.
I don't feel...

29:44.817 --> 29:48.452
Mariah, he will only be in
a tough space if he has to
choose between Yandy and me.

29:48.521 --> 29:50.521
Kimbella...
No, right?

29:50.589 --> 29:52.790
Oh, no, I'm not
picking between you.

29:52.858 --> 29:56.360
I'm excusing myself
from this situation.
I'll walk away.

29:56.428 --> 29:58.729
I don't need friends.
At the end of the day,
I got myself.

29:58.798 --> 30:02.032
I think what I just
heard is Nya say that

30:02.101 --> 30:06.937
the only friendships
that matter of Jonathan's
are hers and Yandy's,

30:07.006 --> 30:11.508
and I don't hear my friend
Jonathan defending me.

30:11.577 --> 30:14.178
What's happening?
What's happening?
I'm walking away,

30:14.246 --> 30:15.979
because there's never
gonna be a situation

30:16.048 --> 30:17.548
where I ever have to
put you in a situation

30:17.616 --> 30:19.550
where you have to choose
between me and someone else.

30:19.618 --> 30:21.985
I'ma make the choice for you
and walk away myself.

30:22.054 --> 30:23.320
Love y'all.
I love you too, Mama.

30:23.389 --> 30:24.988
Enjoy the wine.

30:26.792 --> 30:30.494
Whoo, child,
your friends are weird.
Whoo, child.
Boo, be gone.

30:30.563 --> 30:31.795
Whoo, child.

30:31.864 --> 30:35.032
I'm trying to evolve
and be grown,

30:35.100 --> 30:36.834
so the best thing
for me to do

30:36.902 --> 30:39.269
is subtract myself
from this equation

30:39.338 --> 30:41.171
and as I'm walking away,

30:41.240 --> 30:45.309
I hear in the wind a whistle,
"Whoo, child!"

30:45.377 --> 30:49.546
Bitch, who, child, Nya,
are you referring to?

30:49.615 --> 30:53.684
(Mariahlynn laughs)
Not with me, boo-boo.
Not with me.

30:53.752 --> 30:55.452
But nobody
was coming for you.
But not with me.

30:55.521 --> 30:57.855
Nobody was coming
for you, Nya.
You coming back
and you... you...

30:57.923 --> 30:59.289
'Cause I'm talking
to you 'cause nobody
is coming for you.

30:59.358 --> 31:00.958
Yeah, but you're
not gonna talk...

31:01.026 --> 31:02.659
You're making this
about you.
Wait.

31:02.728 --> 31:05.128
You're gonna back up
out of my face.
Nobody's coming
at you like that.

31:05.197 --> 31:07.564
Yes, you are. I don't even
like your hands in my face.
What I'm saying is this.

31:07.633 --> 31:09.266
Baby, I'm gonna sit down
so you can equally see me.

31:09.335 --> 31:13.003
And I said to you,
at this point, you're
making this about you.

31:13.072 --> 31:16.306
I'm not making this
about me. You said,
"Whoo, child."

31:16.375 --> 31:18.008
Yeah, and I wasn't
talking to you.
I'm talking to him.

31:18.077 --> 31:20.811
Okay, and I've never
had a problem with you,
so I don't even know

31:20.880 --> 31:23.380

You crazy as (bleep)!

31:58.217 --> 32:02.753
Now that I'm seeing how Nya
can just flip and switch,

32:02.821 --> 32:07.758
I don't want to hear about the
old Nya trying to be a new Nya

32:07.826 --> 32:13.997
because Mariah is trying
to elevate, but that's
not gonna stop me

32:14.066 --> 32:20.237
from telling this
big bird blasphemous bitch,
you can't bully me.

32:20.306 --> 32:21.872
Nya, don't do it!

32:35.421 --> 32:38.388
This fight isn't about
what Mariah said.

32:38.457 --> 32:41.291
It's about how she was so quick
to try to test my G.

32:41.360 --> 32:45.162
Mariah knows how important
it is to me to not be
out here fighting,

32:45.230 --> 32:48.565
but she also knows how to press
my mother(bleep) buttons.

32:48.634 --> 32:51.301
(bleep)!
You stripper-ass bitch!
Oh, my God!

32:51.370 --> 32:54.471
You want to talk,

Please, Nya! No! Nya!

32:54.540 --> 32:56.506
Nya Lee!
(glass shatters)

32:56.575 --> 32:58.675
And that didn't hit me,

You hurt me, (bleep)!
You got me (bleep) up!

You got me (bleep) up

these dunk-ass bitches!

33:05.718 --> 33:08.752
You a bum.
You still a bum.
Nya, she is not...

33:08.821 --> 33:11.855
It always happens.
Nya, she is not
worth it, Nya.

33:11.924 --> 33:15.692
Nya's had a rough day.
She's been poked and provoked

33:15.761 --> 33:19.429
and, at this point, I'm not even
shocked that she has popped.

33:19.498 --> 33:22.733
Had Mariah not taken something
personal that wasn't about her,

33:22.801 --> 33:23.900
none of this
would have happened.

33:23.969 --> 33:26.837
I'm the wrong bitch!
I'm the wrong bitch!

33:26.905 --> 33:29.139

I'll run you over

You think you
(bleep) tough, bitch,

'cause you got
sliced, bitch?

33:41.520 --> 33:43.520

Babe, babe, babe,
babe, babe, come on.

33:45.290 --> 33:50.660
No, no, like, no!
I know.

33:50.729 --> 33:53.096
Right now, I'm so disappointed
in myself

33:53.165 --> 33:56.133
because I allowed Mariah
to get me out of character

33:56.201 --> 33:59.236

haters to be somewhat right,

33:59.304 --> 34:02.773

ready to (bleep) up.

You know you
weren't in the wrong.
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

You were...
You were provoked, babe.

I'm the... (bleep).

34:10.716 --> 34:12.949
No. I don't want to talk
to nobody no more.

I've been talking.
I've been talking
to everybody.

34:14.953 --> 34:16.219
I've been letting
everybody rock.

34:16.288 --> 34:17.721
That's why these bitches
think they can talk to me

34:17.790 --> 34:19.122
and handle me
this type of way.

34:19.191 --> 34:22.225
My anger for Mariah right now
doesn't even compare

34:22.294 --> 34:24.194
to how angry I am at myself.

34:24.263 --> 34:27.631
Honestly, I'm just embarrassed.
I'm not even gonna lie.

34:27.699 --> 34:31.301
You could really
injure this girl.
Think about that.
Fam!

34:31.370 --> 34:35.439
What the (bleep)
just happened?
The new Nya,
she's very present,

34:35.507 --> 34:39.376
but the old Nya
lives within,
so at this point,

34:39.445 --> 34:42.646
the new Nya has been
holding old Nya at bay

34:42.714 --> 34:45.916
but I don't have
anything nice to say
to anybody else no more.

34:45.984 --> 34:47.084
We about to leave?
We're gonna leave.

34:47.152 --> 34:48.819

"Let me see what I can pull off

37:51.770 --> 37:53.169

If the judge is okay
with you getting short time,

38:10.989 --> 38:14.024
you keep that in mind,
because going to trial
and losing

38:14.092 --> 38:15.925

because the state is not
fin' to spend this money

38:18.597 --> 38:21.431

38:21.500 --> 38:23.633

and they spend this money

38:23.702 --> 38:26.102

I don't know why

38:42.154 --> 38:43.586
you didn't think
