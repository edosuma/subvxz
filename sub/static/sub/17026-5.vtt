00:35.119 --> 00:36.279
Frank.

00:36.439 --> 00:38.679
So now her entire abdomen's
covered in abscesses.

00:38.799 --> 00:40.679
So much for
the Tijuana tummy tuck.

00:40.839 --> 00:42.279
Please tell us you're wearing
something underneath that.

00:42.399 --> 00:43.679
Want to see for yourself?

00:43.759 --> 00:44.679
I don't really approve

00:44.839 --> 00:46.279
of ER personnel
wearing costumes.

00:46.279 --> 00:47.679
Well, kids seem to like it.

00:47.799 --> 00:50.479
Yes, but what adult wants
to get a cancer diagnosis

00:50.639 --> 00:52.079
from a reject
from Animal House?

00:52.199 --> 00:53.519
I'm Julius Caesar.

00:53.639 --> 00:56.079
We'll drain under
CT guidance to avoid surgery.

00:56.279 --> 00:58.799
Hey, Neela, you, uh,
going to Kayson's talk on recurrent
pericardial effusions?

00:58.959 --> 01:00.079
Since when do you
go to lectures?

01:00.079 --> 01:00.839
I'll save you
a seat.

01:00.839 --> 01:01.879
I might be late. Don't bother.

01:02.039 --> 01:02.879
Simon.
Hi, Dr Brenner.

01:03.039 --> 01:04.638
Nice legs, Frank.
You know, you gave me

01:04.799 --> 01:06.319
some great tips
on our last shift.

01:06.479 --> 01:07.639
I'm really glad we're working
together again.

01:07.759 --> 01:10.239
Actually, Dr Gates
won't be mentoring today.

01:10.439 --> 01:11.999
I won't?
You get to do
the culture list.

01:12.199 --> 01:15.559
All positive cultures from last
week - wounds, urine, sputum.

01:15.679 --> 01:17.319
Make sure they're on
the appropriate antibiotics.

01:17.479 --> 01:19.239
Call them if they have
a resistant bug.

01:19.439 --> 01:22.199
Great, I'm on pus patrol. So I won't
be seeing patients?

01:22.279 --> 01:23.639
You get to do that, too.

01:23.799 --> 01:25.199
Just stick with
the non-criticals.

01:25.359 --> 01:26.279
Dr Brenner
will mentor you both.

01:26.279 --> 01:28.279
Dr Banfield,

01:28.439 --> 01:29.279
I've already done a rotation,
so maybe I can skip?

01:29.279 --> 01:30.639
You're an intern.

01:30.759 --> 01:32.759
Being mentored is
part of the process.

01:32.919 --> 01:36.399
Dr Morris, Tracy
Martin is with you.

01:36.519 --> 01:38.479
Where is Dr Martin?

01:38.639 --> 01:39.759
Not in yet.

01:39.879 --> 01:41.719
I hate working on Halloween.

01:41.879 --> 01:43.118
It's always the same thing.
Uh-uh.

01:43.238 --> 01:45.478
Got the idiot who slices
his hand carving a pumpkin,

01:45.638 --> 01:47.758
your shoes end up covered
in candy-corn puke,

01:47.958 --> 01:49.878
and let's not forget
the old chestnut,

01:50.038 --> 01:51.318
sloppy drunk dressed
as Frankenstein.

01:51.438 --> 01:52.798
Halloween is new to me.

01:52.958 --> 01:54.638
I didn't celebrate it
in Australia.

01:54.798 --> 01:56.078
You never been
trick-or-treating?

01:56.198 --> 01:57.118
Nope.

01:57.278 --> 01:59.118
No candy, no costumes,
no Mischief Night?

01:59.198 --> 02:00.478
What's Mischief Night?

02:00.598 --> 02:02.078
Oh, kids soap up windows,
egg cars,

02:02.078 --> 02:03.478
TP front lawns.

02:03.478 --> 02:06.918
Wow, you were one
deprived child.

02:06.918 --> 02:08.798
Michael Leary, 18, stab wound
in the chest, school fight.

02:08.798 --> 02:10.238
Ah, is that a fork?

02:10.238 --> 02:11.918
Vitals are good,
SATS 97 on room air.

02:11.918 --> 02:12.958
Stupid little dude went crazy.

02:13.158 --> 02:14.278
Okay, trauma one.
Let's go.

02:16.278 --> 02:17.398
I'm sorry I'm late.

02:17.518 --> 02:20.158
This costume is almost
impossible to walk in.

02:20.278 --> 02:21.478
Dr Martin,

02:21.598 --> 02:22.958
care to explain?

02:23.118 --> 02:27.038
I was told that all the interns
were supposed to dress up.

02:27.158 --> 02:29.758
You were misinformed.

02:39.838 --> 02:41.438
Breath sounds equal.
Let's get some access.

02:41.438 --> 02:42.398
Mm-hmm. I'm on it.

02:42.558 --> 02:44.518
He snuck up on me.

02:44.638 --> 02:45.798
Need some help?

02:45.958 --> 02:47.278
Yeah, his pants
need to come off.

02:47.438 --> 02:48.598
If I'd have seen him coming...

02:48.718 --> 02:50.518
Wait, did you just tell her
to take off my pants?

02:50.678 --> 02:51.958
Yep.
Ooh, go for it.

02:52.078 --> 02:54.478
Surgery's on the way.

02:54.478 --> 02:56.078
Laverne...

02:56.198 --> 02:57.278
nice new do.

02:57.478 --> 02:59.038
Thanks. I like
to change it up.

02:59.038 --> 03:00.678
Okay, Dr Saint John,
what's next?

03:00.678 --> 03:02.038
Plain films and ultrasound.

03:02.158 --> 03:03.318
Good idea.

03:03.438 --> 03:04.318
It is?

03:04.438 --> 03:05.918
I mean, you think it is?

03:06.038 --> 03:08.038
Yeah. Get the machine.

03:10.118 --> 03:13.318
Oh, the needle's at
too steep an angle.
Try 45 degrees.

03:13.438 --> 03:14.838
Okay.

03:17.997 --> 03:20.717
I-i got a flash.
Nice.

03:20.837 --> 03:22.517
I'll tape it up for you.

03:22.637 --> 03:24.517
Oh, shoot!

03:24.637 --> 03:26.197
Shoot. Sorry.

03:26.197 --> 03:27.357
"Intra-operative hypotension"?

03:27.517 --> 03:29.677
It's for my nurse
anaesthetist programme.

03:29.677 --> 03:30.757
I have a big test tomorrow.

03:30.757 --> 03:32.317
School sucks, huh?

03:33.717 --> 03:36.997
So you're learning to push drugs
for an anaesthesiologist?

03:37.197 --> 03:38.997
Well, I'll be able to administer
them myself. Thank you.

03:39.157 --> 03:40.717
Yeah, but a real
anaesthesiologist will be

03:40.877 --> 03:41.837
watching over
your shoulder, right?

03:41.957 --> 03:44.557
Actually, no.

03:44.757 --> 03:47.797
How do you go
to classes, work full time,
raise a kid and have a life?

03:47.797 --> 03:50.557
Well, when you put
it like that sounds like a lot ...

03:50.557 --> 03:52.677
Good luck with that.

03:52.677 --> 03:53.757
Thank you. I'm gonna need it.

03:53.757 --> 03:55.397
Nonsense.

03:55.397 --> 03:57.597
A year from now, Sam will be
running her own cases in the OR.

03:58.957 --> 03:59.837
You need something?

03:59.837 --> 04:01.237
Oh, yes.

04:01.237 --> 04:03.157
I want to thank
you for turning in

04:03.157 --> 04:04.717
your schedule
request on time.

04:04.717 --> 04:05.997
My pleasure.

04:05.997 --> 04:07.677
Yes, but I'm a
little surprised.

04:07.677 --> 04:10.717
You opened up your work
availability considerably.

04:10.717 --> 04:13.077
I'm just trying to be
a team player.

04:13.077 --> 04:14.917
Good.

04:14.917 --> 04:17.677
Then maybe you can be in charge
of scheduling guest speakers

04:17.677 --> 04:19.397
for Grand Rounds.
Me?

04:19.397 --> 04:20.357
Figure out
someone good

04:20.357 --> 04:21.197
to start off with.

04:21.197 --> 04:22.357
We have no money.

04:22.357 --> 04:24.597
You'll have to
use your charm.

04:28.957 --> 04:30.157
See that?

04:30.157 --> 04:32.277
The lung's inflating
at the pleural interface.

04:32.277 --> 04:34.077
That's impressive,
Dr Saint John.

04:34.877 --> 04:35.637
Radiology elective.

04:35.637 --> 04:37.077
That was smart.

04:37.077 --> 04:38.957
Hello, all.

04:38.957 --> 04:41.157
Hi, I'm Dr Wade.
I'm a surgeon.

04:41.157 --> 04:43.157
I still can't get used
to the sound of that.

04:43.437 --> 04:44.077
Get used to it, baby.

04:44.077 --> 04:45.317
Okay, Daria,

04:45.317 --> 04:46.317
why don't you
do the honours?

04:46.317 --> 04:48.197
Uh, okay, uh,
fork versus chest.

04:48.197 --> 04:49.397
We're waiting
on CT...

04:49.397 --> 04:50.837
Rule out vascular involvement.

04:50.997 --> 04:51.876
Though it may be
lodged in the...

04:51.956 --> 04:53.276
BOTH: Pectoralis major.

04:53.276 --> 04:54.436
Good. Vitals?
Fine.

04:54.556 --> 04:54.916
Crits? Stable. Dinner later?

04:54.916 --> 04:56.876
Mazzarino's.
Mazzarino's.

04:56.956 --> 04:57.916
One gram of Ancef.

04:58.116 --> 04:59.916
Page me when the CT is done.

04:59.916 --> 05:01.516
Sam, uh,
we got a kid out
here with a bloody nose.

05:01.516 --> 05:02.836
Okay.

05:02.836 --> 05:06.436
Uh, well, uh, you two
are certainly in sync.

05:06.436 --> 05:08.556
Yeah, what can i say? It's chemical.

05:15.276 --> 05:17.036
Ha! You missed me!

05:17.036 --> 05:18.876
Yes, Mrs Ferreri,

05:18.876 --> 05:20.116
you can pick up your
prescriptions in the ER.

05:20.116 --> 05:21.436
Morris, you're not
gonna believe what's...

05:21.436 --> 05:23.036
Hey, Frank, Frank,
give these to Banfield,

05:23.036 --> 05:24.756
will you, and tell her
they're all susceptible.
Okay.

05:24.756 --> 05:27.036
Morris...
Also, could you, uh,

05:27.036 --> 05:29.436
get me a new, uh, clip
for my I.D.? This one's broken.
Fine.

05:29.436 --> 05:31.916
Banfield got some more
positive cultures for you,

05:31.916 --> 05:34.556
and she wants you to see the
sore-throat kid in Exam Three.

05:37.236 --> 05:38.356
All hail, Caesar.

05:38.516 --> 05:39.476
Morris, you got to see
the guy in curtain three.

05:39.476 --> 05:40.356
Frankenstein?

05:40.356 --> 05:41.796
Great.
Just like I called it.

05:41.796 --> 05:43.436
No, you need
to see him now.

05:43.436 --> 05:44.716
In a minute, I just
got to make a phone...

05:44.716 --> 05:46.516
Okay, don't-don't get

05:46.516 --> 05:47.756
your toga in a bunch!

05:49.756 --> 05:50.996
Laverne, look at this.

05:52.036 --> 05:53.276
You see any fracture?

05:53.276 --> 05:54.876
Um, no.

05:54.876 --> 05:56.156
I don't.

05:56.156 --> 05:57.836
Yeah, me either.

05:57.836 --> 05:59.236
But, uh, look here.

05:59.236 --> 06:00.636
Posterior
fat pad sign.

06:00.636 --> 06:02.596
That means there's
blood in the joint

06:02.596 --> 06:03.676
from a fracture.

06:05.276 --> 06:06.596
Listen, I've been
wanting to talk to you.

06:06.596 --> 06:07.396
Dr Brenner.

06:07.396 --> 06:09.236
It's Danny Raskin,

06:09.236 --> 06:10.956
14, persistent nose bleed.

06:10.956 --> 06:12.076
His brother, Scott.

06:12.076 --> 06:13.436
He-he got in a fight.

06:13.436 --> 06:15.516
School nurse couldn't
get it to stop.

06:15.516 --> 06:17.116
Complained of
nausea in the rig.

06:17.116 --> 06:19.436
Well, that's probably
from swallowing blood.

06:19.436 --> 06:21.396
Fork boy is going up to ct.

06:28.235 --> 06:29.235
You know him?

06:29.235 --> 06:31.875
Not really. Classmate.

06:31.875 --> 06:33.475
Did the school
call your parents?

06:33.475 --> 06:34.715
It's just our mom.

06:34.715 --> 06:35.995
They tried, they couldn't get her.

06:35.995 --> 06:38.075
But it's okay, I'm here.

06:38.075 --> 06:40.075
Uh, I'm sorry, but we need
to get a hold of her

06:40.075 --> 06:40.995
before we can treat Danny.

06:41.595 --> 06:44.835
Okay, Scott, I'll take you to the
phone. You can try your mom again.

06:46.475 --> 06:48.355
And you don't look like
the fighting type.

06:48.355 --> 06:49.635
(COUGHS)

06:49.635 --> 06:50.795
I guess I'm not.

06:50.795 --> 06:53.315
All right, Princess Jenny,
open wide.

06:53.315 --> 06:54.395
Tilt your head
back a little bit.

06:54.395 --> 06:55.315
No fever.

06:55.315 --> 06:56.995
Yeah, but she has white spots
on her tonsils.

06:57.955 --> 06:59.715
Dawn, are there
any emesis basins?

06:59.715 --> 07:01.515
Try the
second drawer.

07:01.515 --> 07:03.435
And swollen
glands.

07:03.435 --> 07:04.915
Could it be strep?

07:04.915 --> 07:06.275
Need a dose
of penicillin.

07:06.275 --> 07:07.035
We will?

07:07.035 --> 07:09.195
No, let's do a rapid
strep test first.

07:09.195 --> 07:10.915
She's got exudate
and lymphadenopathy.

07:10.915 --> 07:13.315
We don't want to give
unnecessary antibiotics, Sam.

07:13.315 --> 07:14.275
I'll get the
swab.

07:17.155 --> 07:18.595
Sam, there's a positive
blood culture, uh,

07:18.595 --> 07:20.075
from about a week ago
at the front desk.

07:20.075 --> 07:21.915
Will you grab it,
take it to medical records,

07:21.915 --> 07:23.315
and hunt down
a chart for me, please?

07:23.315 --> 07:25.395
Well, I'm with a trauma, and I got
six other patients. Send your
intern.

07:25.395 --> 07:26.595
I don't have one today,

07:26.595 --> 07:27.395
and there's no point
sending a doctor

07:27.395 --> 07:28.515
on a no-brainer like that.

07:28.515 --> 07:29.555
All right,
Your Highness.

07:29.555 --> 07:30.875
All done.

07:30.875 --> 07:31.995
Do I need this?

07:31.995 --> 07:33.275
Nope.

07:33.275 --> 07:34.835
Sure, no problem.

07:34.835 --> 07:36.995
Should have the results
back in 20 minutes.

07:39.315 --> 07:40.595
Dr Livingstone, I presume?

07:43.755 --> 07:44.995
What you got here?

07:47.035 --> 07:48.955
Birds aren't allowed in the ER.

07:48.955 --> 07:51.195
Oh, but...
It's okay, Dawn.

07:51.195 --> 07:52.475
I don't think this wild animal's
gonna give us any trouble.

07:54.995 --> 07:56.635
Left another message for Mom.

07:56.635 --> 07:58.234
Here, if you throw up,
throw up in that, okay?

07:58.234 --> 07:59.834
Ooh!

07:59.834 --> 08:01.194
So, Danny, how'd you
get in a fight?

08:03.514 --> 08:04.634
There's this guy at school,

08:05.914 --> 08:07.794
he's been saying
stuff about our mom.

08:07.794 --> 08:09.034
What kind of
stuff?

08:09.034 --> 08:11.394
I don't understand all of it,
but I know it's bad.

08:11.394 --> 08:12.994
I told you not to listen.

08:12.994 --> 08:15.194
All right, staph aureus,
no sensitivities.

08:15.194 --> 08:16.514
Well, they're always pointing

08:16.514 --> 08:17.914
and laughing at me in the halls.

08:17.914 --> 08:19.314
It's cos he's a jerk.

08:19.314 --> 08:21.114
I mean, they just like
picking on younger kids.

08:21.114 --> 08:21.794
Don't worry about it.

08:21.794 --> 08:23.874
Got it. Thanks.

08:23.874 --> 08:27.714
That's a marker for inducible
clindamycin resistance.

08:28.994 --> 08:30.634
You should check to
see if the lab did a D test.

08:30.634 --> 08:32.073
Daria, you got
to stop being so smart.

08:32.073 --> 08:33.234
You're gonna make me look bad.

08:35.034 --> 08:36.714
Daria, get some
two-by-two's.

08:38.554 --> 08:39.953
So what happened
at lunch?

08:39.953 --> 08:41.953
Well, I asked him why

08:41.953 --> 08:43.514
he was talking about my mom.

08:43.514 --> 08:45.594
He just laughed and
called her a name.

08:45.594 --> 08:47.074
You don't need
to know this.

08:47.074 --> 08:48.594
Just fix him.

08:48.594 --> 08:53.794
So I got mad, and I hit him
with a food tray.

08:53.794 --> 08:55.914
I don't remember
after that.

08:55.914 --> 08:59.354
(RETCHES)

09:02.754 --> 09:04.314
Low-grade fever: 100.6.

09:04.314 --> 09:06.394
All right, give her 15 per
kilo of acetaminophen.

09:09.914 --> 09:11.954
You, uh, tame any
wild lions today, buddy?

09:11.954 --> 09:14.794
Um, Owen doesn't like
to talk much lately.

09:14.794 --> 09:17.714
He's been having a hard time
since their father and I...

09:17.714 --> 09:19.514
I see.

09:19.514 --> 09:20.714
My ex moved
out of state

09:20.714 --> 09:22.754
with his younger
pregnant wife Veronica.

09:22.754 --> 09:24.354
I hate Veronica.

09:24.354 --> 09:26.394
Did that bird
just talk?

09:26.394 --> 09:29.034
Uh, the therapist thought Trevor
would be good for Owen,

09:29.034 --> 09:30.593
might help him
express his feelings.

09:30.593 --> 09:32.433
Trevor is very expressive.

09:32.433 --> 09:34.393
Where is she?
I don't want to miss this.

09:34.393 --> 09:35.593
Maybe she's in surgery.

09:35.593 --> 09:36.753
She here yet?
No.
No.

09:36.753 --> 09:39.353
They should tell her
it's a perfed ulcer.

09:39.353 --> 09:40.593
That'll get her down here fast.

09:40.593 --> 09:42.433
Okay, Archie,
where's Neela?

09:42.433 --> 09:43.193
Paged her again.

09:43.193 --> 09:44.993
She's here.
Quick, act natural.

09:44.993 --> 09:48.953
Morris, you can't keep paging
me every five minutes. What is it?

09:48.953 --> 09:50.793
Very, very sick patient
in curtain three.

09:50.793 --> 09:52.753
Well, he doesn't
look that sick,

09:52.753 --> 09:54.273
he's walking around. What's his
complaint?

09:54.273 --> 09:56.433
Uh, he-he's
turning green.

10:02.753 --> 10:05.273
Hello.
I'm, uh, Dr Rasgotra.

10:05.273 --> 10:06.513
How can I help you?

10:06.513 --> 10:08.553
Mm. Neck hurt.

10:08.553 --> 10:10.313
Mm-hmm, I see.

10:10.313 --> 10:11.473
And, uh, anything else?

10:13.873 --> 10:16.873
Need brain transplant.

10:16.873 --> 10:18.993
Sir, this is an ER,

10:18.993 --> 10:22.393
with real patients who are sick
and who need our help.

10:23.273 --> 10:24.393
Hey, roomie.

10:25.713 --> 10:26.793
You bastard!

10:26.793 --> 10:28.553
LAUGHTER, CLAPPING

10:28.553 --> 10:30.353
Oh, my God!

10:30.353 --> 10:31.993
Oh...!

11:18.392 --> 11:20.032
..there was a Weight Watchers plan

11:20.152 --> 11:21.912
you could do
completely online?

11:22.232 --> 11:23.472
..it had tips, tools

11:23.552 --> 11:25.192
and more than a thousand recipes

11:25.272 --> 11:27.112

11:27.232 --> 11:29.592

12:29.552 --> 12:31.112
..for my wheels, texted to my phone.

12:31.192 --> 12:32.072
I demanded a quote...

12:32.152 --> 12:33.392
..60 seconds ago.

12:33.472 --> 12:35.111
I'm happy, because I'm online!

12:35.311 --> 12:37.231
Get a life!

# TANGO

13:45.911 --> 13:47.871
MUSIC PLAYS BACKWARDS

13:52.271 --> 13:54.671
You never know
when it's going to happen.

13:54.791 --> 13:56.711
So be ready
with Macleans.

15:22.230 --> 15:23.830
And miss the surprised looks
on your faces?

15:23.830 --> 15:25.110
Not a chance.
You in town long?

15:25.110 --> 15:26.910
Yeah, we should all go out.

15:26.910 --> 15:27.830
That sounds great,

15:27.830 --> 15:29.390
but I'm only here for one night

15:29.390 --> 15:30.550
for the annual
rehab medicine assembly.

15:30.550 --> 15:32.470
So, you're working
at an ER down south?

15:32.470 --> 15:35.390
I left emergency medicine,
actually.

15:35.390 --> 15:37.750
I'm, uh, doing
a residency in PM and R -

15:37.750 --> 15:39.830
physical medicine
and rehabilitation.

15:39.830 --> 15:41.309
And you like it?

15:41.309 --> 15:42.389
Yeah, I do.

15:42.389 --> 15:45.309
I get to work with traumatic
brain and spinal cord injuries,

15:45.309 --> 15:47.149
um, stroke patients, amputees.

15:48.709 --> 15:50.469
And it keeps me on my toes.

15:50.469 --> 15:53.269
Well, make that
carbon-fibre toes.

15:57.269 --> 15:59.509
Well, it's good to see you
up and around.

15:59.509 --> 16:00.829
Thanks.

16:03.349 --> 16:04.589
Ray.

16:04.589 --> 16:05.629
Hey.

16:05.629 --> 16:07.949
How you doing?
I'm good.

16:07.949 --> 16:10.309
Okay, people, I'm sure
you all have work to do.

16:10.309 --> 16:13.909
Gates, Sam, there's a hand
injury in Exam Two that
needs your attention.

16:13.909 --> 16:15.669
Ray, good to see you.

16:15.669 --> 16:17.149
You, too.

16:17.149 --> 16:18.669
See you around.

16:18.669 --> 16:20.269
We'll talk later.

16:20.269 --> 16:21.909
Neela,
don't let this guy get away.

16:21.909 --> 16:23.949
Uh, who's that?

16:23.949 --> 16:26.189
Uh, new chief
of the ER.

16:26.189 --> 16:28.069
Another one? How many does
that make?

16:28.069 --> 16:29.429
I've lost count.

16:29.429 --> 16:31.189
Neela, you want
to head over to
Kayson's talk?

16:31.189 --> 16:33.789
Uh, oh, yeah, the talk.
I can't.

16:33.789 --> 16:35.429
I hear it's gonna
be pretty good.

16:35.429 --> 16:37.029
Yeah, no doubt.
I'm busy.

16:39.109 --> 16:40.909
Well, um, if you want
to go, you should go.

16:40.909 --> 16:42.869
No, I don't.
I mean, I can't.

16:42.869 --> 16:45.029
Okay.

16:45.029 --> 16:47.149
Well, uh,
I'll fill you in later.

16:47.149 --> 16:48.709
Hey, uh,
guess who's in charge

16:48.709 --> 16:50.309
of the ER's new teaching
conferences.
Really?

16:50.309 --> 16:53.789
Yeah. I've invited Atul Gawande
to speak at Grand Rounds.

16:53.789 --> 16:55.429
Oh, he's far too busy.
You'll never get him.

16:57.149 --> 16:59.029
A bottle of champagne
says I will.

17:03.909 --> 17:06.509
Hi. I'm Ray Barnett.

17:06.509 --> 17:08.749
Oh, sorry. this is
Simon Brenner,

17:08.749 --> 17:09.989
new attending.

17:09.989 --> 17:11.709
This is, uh, Ray.
He used to work here.

17:11.709 --> 17:13.029
Ah.

17:15.948 --> 17:17.188
So...

17:20.028 --> 17:22.988
...so you've been lucky enough to
work with the brilliant
Dr Rasgotra?

17:23.988 --> 17:26.188
I've had that privilege, yes.

17:26.188 --> 17:27.667
So where are you
practising now?

17:27.667 --> 17:29.428
Baton Rouge.

17:29.428 --> 17:32.188
Baton Rouge.
I hear it's nice.

17:32.188 --> 17:33.468
Yeah.

17:39.308 --> 17:40.788
Okay, Neela, I will catch
you later.

17:40.788 --> 17:42.548
Ray, great to meet ya.
Right back at ya.

17:42.548 --> 17:45.748
Listen, if you need
to go to Kayson's talk...

17:45.748 --> 17:46.908
No, I don't.

17:46.908 --> 17:48.468
I, but I've got some
work to finish off,

17:48.468 --> 17:49.428
so it won't take long.

17:51.508 --> 17:54.148
So that Brenner guy...
Mm-hmm?

17:54.148 --> 17:55.668
..kind of seems
like a dick.

17:58.068 --> 18:00.348
I think my wife
put glue in there.

18:00.348 --> 18:01.108
Your wife?
why would she do that?

18:01.108 --> 18:05.068
Well, she says
I love bowling more
than I love her.

18:06.388 --> 18:08.948
And, well, I got a girlfriend
on the side.

18:12.268 --> 18:14.428
Hey, I heard you might have
a good teaching case.

18:15.668 --> 18:17.108
Oh, sports injury, huh?

18:17.108 --> 18:18.268
Hi.
Hi.

18:18.268 --> 18:19.748
Yeah, he's got tingling
in the thumb,

18:19.748 --> 18:20.788
numbness in the rest
of the fingers.

18:20.788 --> 18:21.868
What do you make of that?

18:21.868 --> 18:24.908
Uh, median nerve neuropraxia
from hyperextension.

18:24.908 --> 18:27.708
Nice. What about motor
and reflex deficits?

18:27.708 --> 18:28.988
Uh, wrist extensors...

18:31.308 --> 18:32.508
...biceps...

18:32.508 --> 18:33.828
I know!

18:33.828 --> 18:35.228
Brachioradialis.

18:35.228 --> 18:36.428
Oh, folks,
she was so close.

18:36.428 --> 18:38.708
Can I give another four
of morphine?

18:38.708 --> 18:40.548
Yeah, morphine fine,
amphetamine fat.

18:42.988 --> 18:45.468
Morphine overdose gives you
fine, contricted pupils.

18:45.468 --> 18:47.668
Amphetamine gives you
fat, dilated pupils.
It's a mnemonic.

18:47.668 --> 18:49.867
It might help you out
with your test.

18:49.867 --> 18:52.307
A mnemonic is a saying you use
to remember complicated facts.

18:52.307 --> 18:53.867
Yeah, I know what a mnemonic is.

18:53.867 --> 18:55.667
And I also know

18:55.667 --> 18:57.067
what morphine does without
some stupid saying.

18:58.827 --> 19:00.907
Sam, that mom you called
is here.

19:00.907 --> 19:02.467
Oh, I gotta go.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.347
Uh, Mrs Raskin?

19:09.347 --> 19:11.747
Oh, Sandy Rraskin.
Hi. I'm Sam.

19:11.747 --> 19:13.947
Dr Brenner,
this is Danny's mom.

19:13.947 --> 19:15.667
How's my son?

19:15.667 --> 19:16.747
Anxious to see you.

19:21.467 --> 19:23.027
Wow, finally.

19:23.027 --> 19:24.547
I couldn't check my messages
until my break.

19:24.547 --> 19:25.547
You know how it gets at work.

19:28.107 --> 19:30.707
Okay, we're gonna need
your consent to pack
Danny's nose.

19:30.707 --> 19:32.067
Oh, sure, sure,
whatever he needs.

19:32.067 --> 19:33.987
Honey, how did
this happen?

19:33.987 --> 19:36.547
It was nothing.
He's in the hospital,
Scott, that's not nothing.

19:39.667 --> 19:41.467
I'm sorry.

19:41.467 --> 19:42.787
My aim's not so good.

19:42.787 --> 19:44.387
It's okay.

19:44.387 --> 19:45.467
Happens all the time.

19:45.467 --> 19:48.347
Danny?
Danny, are you all right?

19:48.347 --> 19:50.827
My head hurts.

19:50.827 --> 19:53.267
Okay, Sam, get
a blood pressure.

19:53.267 --> 19:55.427
Did the other kid hit him
with anything?

19:55.427 --> 19:57.307
I don't know. I wasn't there.

19:57.307 --> 19:58.627
Did he fall and hit his head?

19:59.867 --> 20:01.627
He's hypertensive, 138/89.

20:01.627 --> 20:03.587
Okay, let's move him.

20:03.587 --> 20:05.547
Surgical consult.
25 of Mannitol.

20:05.547 --> 20:08.787
Miss Hoffman's Vanco Trough
is 6.4.

20:08.787 --> 20:10.387
Should we keep her
in a gram q 12?

20:10.387 --> 20:13.707
Push her levels to 15.
Change it to 1.5 q 12

20:13.707 --> 20:15.427
and repeat the Trough
with the third dose.

20:15.427 --> 20:16.587
What's up?

20:16.587 --> 20:18.027
How are you liking
rehab residency?

20:18.027 --> 20:19.547
Oh, it's not always fun,

20:19.547 --> 20:20.867
but it's rewarding.

20:20.867 --> 20:22.987
I've gotten involved
with the academy's

20:22.987 --> 20:24.466
injured soldier
task force.

20:24.466 --> 20:25.506
We facilitate access

20:25.506 --> 20:27.906
to care for wounded soldiers
and vets.

20:27.906 --> 20:28.986
That doesn't
sound easy.

20:28.986 --> 20:30.226
Yeah, especially when
you're dealing with the VA

20:30.226 --> 20:31.266
and the Defence department.

20:31.266 --> 20:34.626
I hope my surprise visit
isn't wrecking

20:34.626 --> 20:36.306
any of your big plans
tonight.

20:36.306 --> 20:38.226
Well, if you consider
working out

20:38.226 --> 20:40.026
and doing laundry
big plans, then...

20:40.026 --> 20:41.826
Hey, Neela...

20:41.826 --> 20:43.146
Anspaugh was gonna do
a laparotomy

20:43.146 --> 20:45.106
on that abscess patient, but he
went with your plan instead.

20:45.106 --> 20:46.986
Good job.
Thanks, Marisol.

20:46.986 --> 20:50.786
I'm, uh, done in
about 20 minutes.

20:50.786 --> 20:52.826
We can sit, we'll
have some coffee.

20:52.826 --> 20:54.226
No, let's work out.

20:54.226 --> 20:55.426
Really?

20:55.426 --> 20:56.786
Yeah, it'll be good
after travelling all day.

20:58.426 --> 20:59.906
Find me when you're done.

20:59.906 --> 21:00.986
Uh, wait -

21:00.986 --> 21:02.706
wait, uh, you haven't
got a good seal.

21:05.626 --> 21:07.826
What?
What are you smiling at?

21:07.826 --> 21:09.026
Nothing.

21:13.746 --> 21:15.426
I'm sorry about this.

21:15.426 --> 21:16.746
The lab lost
the first specimen.

21:16.746 --> 21:18.186
And they won't
lose this one?

21:18.186 --> 21:19.506
I'll hand it to them
personally

21:19.506 --> 21:20.586
and stand there
while they run it.

21:20.586 --> 21:21.466
All right, we're gonna
need this room,

21:21.466 --> 21:22.666
so I'm gonna have to ask you
to go out in the lobby

21:22.666 --> 21:23.866
and wait for the results
to come back.

21:23.866 --> 21:25.386
Well, how long will that be?
It's Halloween.

21:25.386 --> 21:26.506
We have candy
at the desk.

21:26.506 --> 21:27.506
The kids will stop there
on the way.

21:27.506 --> 21:28.746
All right, time to put
Trevor back in his cage.

21:33.906 --> 21:36.066
Owen, owen!
I'll take care of this.
Take her to waiting.

21:40.186 --> 21:41.506
There you are.
Want some?

21:41.506 --> 21:43.066
Ooh, no, thanks.

21:43.066 --> 21:44.866
I still remember what
County coffee tastes like.

21:48.826 --> 21:49.506
You look great, man.

21:49.506 --> 21:50.986
How are things?

21:50.986 --> 21:53.466
I still have a few more
operations in my future,

21:53.466 --> 21:54.746
but nothing
like before.

22:01.145 --> 22:04.905
I was in for a skin graft
when i heard about Greg.

22:06.265 --> 22:08.945
I'm sorry I couldn't
make it to the funeral.

22:08.945 --> 22:12.465
Hey, everybody
understood.

22:14.825 --> 22:16.305
You doing okay?

22:18.825 --> 22:20.305
I miss him.

22:20.305 --> 22:22.425
It sucks but, you know,
what can you do?

22:22.425 --> 22:26.705
I gotta say, the way you,

22:26.705 --> 22:28.505
the way you walk
on those prosthetics,

22:28.505 --> 22:30.025
pretty amazing.

22:31.585 --> 22:34.265
Well, I got some
custom foot modules.

22:34.265 --> 22:36.985
Makes it easier to move
and climb stairs.

22:36.985 --> 22:40.505
You know, sometimes,
when I wake up,

22:40.505 --> 22:43.425
I actually forget what happened
and I jump out of bed

22:43.425 --> 22:44.825
and wind up on the floor.

22:44.825 --> 22:45.825
(LAUGHS)

22:47.305 --> 22:48.385
Sorry, that's not funny?

22:48.385 --> 22:50.385
Yeah, yeah, actually,
it is every time.

22:51.905 --> 22:54.265
Oh, um, Dr Morris,
have you seen Dr Gates?

22:54.265 --> 22:55.745
No. Do you need something?

22:56.985 --> 22:59.225
Yeah, I just got a question
on a knee effusion.

22:59.225 --> 23:00.625
I'm sure Dr Brenner
can answer that.

23:00.625 --> 23:02.945
That's okay.
I'll wait for Tony.

23:04.985 --> 23:06.865
So, Neela, she's
doing good, huh?

23:06.865 --> 23:08.945
Dude, Neela is
a surgery superstar.

23:08.945 --> 23:10.505
She's gonna be running
the department one day.

23:10.505 --> 23:12.425
They must be working her
pretty hard.

23:12.425 --> 23:14.265
Lots of long hours,

23:14.265 --> 23:16.705
nights, weekends - I mean, that
can't be too much fun, right?

23:17.665 --> 23:19.145
the D-stick on your
ballet dancer's 34.

23:19.145 --> 23:21.265
Okay, I gotta run.

23:21.265 --> 23:23.425
If I don't see you before you
leave, take care of yourself.

23:23.425 --> 23:26.745
Oh, and, uh, no, Ray,
as far as I know,

23:26.745 --> 23:28.905
Neela's not seeing anyone.

23:28.905 --> 23:31.625
What? No, no, no.
See, I wasn't...

23:35.305 --> 23:36.344
Owen!

23:37.784 --> 23:38.984
Owen!

23:44.984 --> 23:47.344
Hey, Owen, look, I know
Trevor's smart,

23:47.344 --> 23:48.624
but I doubt he opened that door
and flew down here.

23:48.624 --> 23:49.784
Come on. Let's go.

23:49.784 --> 23:52.304
(RATTLES DOORKNOB)

23:55.944 --> 23:58.264
Don't worry. You know what?
I'm gonna call the front desk

23:58.264 --> 23:59.344
and someone will come
let us out.

24:03.824 --> 24:04.864
Wild kingdom, I don't suppose

24:04.864 --> 24:05.744
you have a cellphone on you,
do you?

24:10.824 --> 24:12.424
(MUFFLED) Help! Hey!

24:13.344 --> 24:14.224
CT can take him in five minutes.

24:15.264 --> 24:16.504
I just don't understand
why Danny would be in a fight.

24:16.504 --> 24:17.584
It's just not like him.

24:17.584 --> 24:19.184
Okay, put him on the portable.

24:19.184 --> 24:21.144
Maybe he didn't like
hearing all the rumours, Ma.

24:21.144 --> 24:22.264
What rumours?

24:23.744 --> 24:24.784
What's this about?

24:24.784 --> 24:26.064
My intern will
go with him.

24:26.064 --> 24:26.984
Got it.
Where are you going?

24:26.984 --> 24:27.984
I'm off. Call Dubenko

24:27.984 --> 24:29.064
as soon as Neurosurge sees
the film.

24:29.064 --> 24:29.904
This is their case now.

24:31.064 --> 24:32.944
Hey, um, do you guys
need any help in here?

24:32.944 --> 24:34.184
You're a little late.

24:34.184 --> 24:35.544
Scott, what rumours?

24:35.544 --> 24:37.064
Like you really can't
think of any reason

24:37.064 --> 24:38.064
kids are talking
about you?

24:40.544 --> 24:42.144
Are you stupid
or just drunk?

24:42.144 --> 24:44.344
Just calm down.
You're not helping your brother.

24:44.344 --> 24:46.424
There's Mike. Maybe he can
explain it to you.

24:54.224 --> 24:55.464
What's he have to do with this?

24:55.464 --> 24:56.984
Go ask. You're banging him!

25:09.424 --> 25:14.183
OK, how does
to the zoo and back sound?

25:14.383 --> 25:16.783
Sounds good, but it's
about four miles.

25:16.783 --> 25:18.583
Yeah, these babies
can take it.

25:18.703 --> 25:20.063
Afraid you can't?

25:20.183 --> 25:22.983
I can.
Last one there buys dinner.

25:23.103 --> 25:25.623
Better get your wallet out.

25:25.743 --> 25:28.023
Ready?

25:35.623 --> 25:37.823
All right...
you ready ready?

26:34.663 --> 26:35.743
Got a cold?

26:35.823 --> 26:37.063
Need help fast?

26:37.183 --> 26:38.703
Lemsip Max
All In One

26:38.783 --> 26:39.743
starts to get to work

26:39.823 --> 26:41.783
in just five minutes.

26:42.783 --> 26:44.103
No hot drink works faster

26:44.183 --> 26:45.663
for cold and flu.

26:47.502 --> 26:48.462
And now available,

26:48.542 --> 26:49.742
the only max strength

26:49.862 --> 26:51.782
all-in-one liquid
from Lemsip.

26:53.702 --> 26:56.302
When a burning sore throat
holds you back,

26:56.382 --> 26:57.142
new...

26:58.582 --> 26:59.982
..has a new
formulation

27:00.102 --> 27:01.982
with proven
medicinal action

27:02.102 --> 27:04.302
and an instantly
cooling sensation,

27:04.382 --> 27:06.822
with medicine that goes on working

27:06.902 --> 27:08.702
long after the lozenge has gone.

27:09.662 --> 27:11.262
Try new:

27:11.622 --> 27:13.582
There's nothing quite like it.

27:44.542 --> 27:45.622
Crunchy poppadoms...

27:46.022 --> 27:49.502
... cool, cucumber and mint philly...
tangy mango chutney.

27:49.862 --> 27:51.302
Philadelphia Splendips

27:51.742 --> 27:52.822
Three steps to heaven.

28:24.221 --> 28:26.261
At Sainsbury's,
until Valentine's Day,

28:26.381 --> 28:27.781
buy these
Thorntons chocolates

28:27.901 --> 28:29.941
and this bottle
of cava together

28:30.021 --> 28:31.341
for only Â£10.

28:31.421 --> 28:32.861
Just made for each other.

30:59.100 --> 31:00.460
Hey, Danny,
hang in there!

31:00.460 --> 31:01.780
Tired...

31:01.780 --> 31:03.900
The CT showed
a subdural haematoma

31:03.900 --> 31:05.580
over the right
parietal area.

31:05.580 --> 31:07.300
Wh-what does that mean?

31:07.300 --> 31:08.500
Sat's only 93.

31:08.500 --> 31:09.580
There's blood
putting pressure

31:09.580 --> 31:10.620
on the surface
of his brain.

31:10.620 --> 31:11.740
Let's get him
on a non-rebreather.

31:11.740 --> 31:13.620
It needs to be
cleaned out in the OR

31:13.620 --> 31:14.980
to prevent any further damage.
Can you spare an intern?

31:15.100 --> 31:16.380
Dr Banfield's
doing a pleural tap.

31:16.500 --> 31:18.300
Laverne can go.

31:18.460 --> 31:20.260
It'll be good experience.
Are you sure? Because I can...

31:20.380 --> 31:21.420
Go. You've earned it.

31:21.540 --> 31:22.620
Thank you.

31:22.780 --> 31:23.900
Scott, tell me
what happened now!

31:24.060 --> 31:27.660
Danny attacked Mike
because he was

31:27.660 --> 31:29.900
bragging all over school about
what an easy lay you are.

31:29.980 --> 31:31.300
Mike wouldn't do that.

31:31.460 --> 31:33.180
What, you think he's in
love with you or something?

31:33.300 --> 31:34.499
He's using you.

31:34.659 --> 31:36.659
ALARMS SOUND
Pulse ox is only 87.

31:36.659 --> 31:39.019
He's hypoventilating.
Kid needs a tube.

31:39.019 --> 31:40.259
Danny, breathe.

31:40.259 --> 31:41.379
Breathe!

31:41.379 --> 31:42.699
Daria, you're up.

31:42.699 --> 31:44.859
15 etomidate, 75 of sux.

31:44.859 --> 31:47.019
Already drawn - I'm pushing it.
Mac two and a 6-O.

31:47.019 --> 31:49.779
Always check the equipment
before we start.

31:49.899 --> 31:50.699
How could you do that to me?

31:50.699 --> 31:52.939
I swear! I told you
I didn't say anything!

31:52.939 --> 31:54.259
Watch the teeth.

31:57.219 --> 31:58.539
I can't see the cords.

31:58.539 --> 31:59.859
Here's some suction.

31:59.859 --> 32:01.659
Your freak kid attacked me!
Don't say that!

32:01.659 --> 32:03.339
Danny needs you!

32:03.339 --> 32:04.739
Yeah, I still can't see...

32:04.739 --> 32:06.299
You're nothing but
a crazy drunk whore, anyway!

32:06.299 --> 32:07.739
What do you want, man?

32:07.739 --> 32:09.659
Scott! stop!

32:09.659 --> 32:11.499
Help!

32:11.499 --> 32:13.099
OK, pull out and bag him up.

32:13.099 --> 32:14.539
I'll be back.

32:14.539 --> 32:16.699
Pull the blade up.
I am!

32:16.699 --> 32:18.139
No, you're
rocking it back.

32:18.139 --> 32:20.019
Dr Brenner,
I can't get it!

32:20.019 --> 32:21.099
Watch out - tube.

32:21.099 --> 32:22.379
I thought
you just said...

32:22.379 --> 32:24.139
Give me the tube!

32:29.259 --> 32:31.779
You don't need a mnemonic
to save someone's airway.

32:37.859 --> 32:39.819
Hey!

32:41.019 --> 32:43.499
Well, we're not
getting out that way.

32:43.499 --> 32:47.259
Don't worry, pretty soon
I'm gonna get you out of here,

32:47.259 --> 32:50.259
and you're gonna with your mom
and your sister and Trevor.

32:50.259 --> 32:52.459
The important thing is not
to be scared, OK?

32:55.259 --> 32:57.699
Looks like you made out
pretty good there, huh?

32:57.699 --> 33:00.339
May I have a piece
of candy?

33:01.379 --> 33:03.019
No?

33:03.019 --> 33:04.699
You have enough sugar in there

33:04.699 --> 33:06.779
to put all of Chicago
into a diabetic coma.

33:06.779 --> 33:08.659
One piece?

33:14.818 --> 33:16.818
All right, you know what
you're doing there?

33:16.938 --> 33:18.738
It's called emotional eating.

33:21.938 --> 33:23.658
Anybody seen the chart
on my flatulence guy?

33:23.778 --> 33:25.058
It is not in the rack

33:25.218 --> 33:28.098
and I am not going back into
his room to look for it again.

33:28.218 --> 33:29.618
Ah!

33:29.778 --> 33:32.138
Wh-why-why is there a bird
on my charts?

33:32.258 --> 33:36.098
That's Trevor - he belongs to a
family Dr Gates was seeing.

33:36.178 --> 33:37.458
Where is Dr Gates?

33:37.618 --> 33:39.058
No-one's seen him
in a while.

33:40.738 --> 33:41.978
Frank!

33:47.538 --> 33:49.778
Find Gates and get
this bird...

33:49.898 --> 33:51.098
James Mackey,

33:51.258 --> 33:53.258
multiple gunshots to the chest
and the upper left arm.

33:53.418 --> 33:54.538
Halloween party
got out of hand.

33:54.658 --> 33:55.818
I need vitals.

33:55.978 --> 33:57.258
Tachy at 120, pressure's
at 100 with a litre.

33:57.258 --> 33:58.658
Four of O-neg,
portable x-ray.

33:58.658 --> 34:00.578
No pulse in
the left wrist.

34:00.578 --> 34:02.018
What's with
the police escort?

34:02.018 --> 34:03.338
They say this guy tried
to shoot at some cops,

34:03.338 --> 34:05.418
and they shot
at him first.

34:07.578 --> 34:10.458
Five stitches.
That's not too bad.

34:14.217 --> 34:16.498
Danny's gonna be fine.

34:16.658 --> 34:18.898
When we're finished here,
I'll take you upstairs,

34:19.058 --> 34:20.978
and you can wait
with your mom.

34:22.777 --> 34:24.658
He's right -
she's a whore.

34:25.898 --> 34:27.378
You shouldn't say that.

34:29.098 --> 34:30.818
Then why does she
act like she does?

34:30.978 --> 34:33.018
She lets us go to bed
whenever we want,

34:33.178 --> 34:34.777
she never yells at us
to do homework.

34:34.938 --> 34:36.418
We can have friends over
anytime.

34:36.418 --> 34:38.018
Well, some kids
would love that.

34:39.418 --> 34:41.058
She lets us drink.

34:42.697 --> 34:46.697
Better at home than
some strange place, she says.

34:48.777 --> 34:51.777
But then, uh, she starts
drinking with us,

34:51.897 --> 34:54.137
starts flirting
with the guys...

34:55.056 --> 34:57.177
Does Danny know
what's going on?

34:59.697 --> 35:01.937
When he was younger,
I could make stuff up.

35:04.057 --> 35:05.737
Now he's in
the same school...

35:11.177 --> 35:13.257
I hate her.

35:16.737 --> 35:21.257
I know she's let you down -
I get that -

35:21.257 --> 35:24.097
but try not to hate her.

35:25.337 --> 35:27.297
That's not gonna
get you anywhere.

35:32.177 --> 35:33.457
Do you want some more
orange beef?

35:33.617 --> 35:34.697
Mmm, no -
any more of that

35:34.857 --> 35:36.697
and I won't be able
to fit through the door.

35:36.857 --> 35:39.337
Well, then, I guess
you'll just have to stay here

35:39.457 --> 35:40.537
and never leave.

35:40.657 --> 35:44.097
Well, don't tempt me.

35:44.097 --> 35:46.297
Actually,
it would be nice.

35:46.297 --> 35:49.377
It gets lonely
around here sometimes.

35:50.417 --> 35:52.897
Yeah, I know what
that's like.

35:52.897 --> 35:55.417
But you have your mom
nearby.

35:55.417 --> 35:57.737
Mm-hm.

35:57.737 --> 36:00.697
She's great.

36:00.697 --> 36:03.497
But a lot of the time,
she doesn't get it.

36:03.497 --> 36:06.537
She can't understand why
I don't want her help.

36:08.057 --> 36:10.897
That must be
frustrating.

36:11.097 --> 36:13.937
Yeah, I just think
that, deep down,

36:13.937 --> 36:16.857
she's a little worried
that I might...

36:18.177 --> 36:21.217
I kinda freaked her
out at one point, so...

36:21.337 --> 36:23.217
When?

36:23.377 --> 36:25.136
It was a long time ago.
It was a bad time.

36:25.136 --> 36:27.056
What happened?

36:32.216 --> 36:37.376
It was at the hospital,
after the accident.

36:37.376 --> 36:40.496
I tried to hurt myself.

36:42.456 --> 36:45.176
I tried to kill myself.

36:46.616 --> 36:48.536
Vicodin.

36:50.576 --> 36:52.416
I wish I had known.

36:52.536 --> 36:54.976
I would've tried to help.

36:54.976 --> 36:58.176
No, no,
it was something...

36:58.336 --> 37:01.056
that I had to go through
on my own.

37:02.576 --> 37:07.096
And I feel pretty strong now,
having overcome all that.

37:20.016 --> 37:21.016
ALARMS SOUND
Intubation tray.

37:21.136 --> 37:22.696
Prep for a chest tube.

37:22.856 --> 37:24.656
So we don't get
a tension pneumo.

37:24.816 --> 37:26.616
Set up fibre optic and
open a crike tray.

37:26.776 --> 37:28.096
We can get those
if we need them.

37:28.216 --> 37:29.736
Induction meds on board.

37:29.896 --> 37:30.976
All right, let's do it.

37:31.096 --> 37:33.536
Give the meds a minute to work.
Bag him up.

37:33.696 --> 37:35.976
This the guy from
the Halloween party shooting?

37:36.096 --> 37:37.376
Are you family?

37:37.496 --> 37:39.336
No, a police officer.

37:39.496 --> 37:40.736
Sorry, but you can't
question him now.

37:40.896 --> 37:42.856
Well, you gotta make sure
this kid makes it.

37:44.336 --> 37:45.936
All right, do a jaw thrust,

37:45.936 --> 37:47.176
so you don't fill
his stomach with air.

37:47.176 --> 37:49.016
OK, Tracy, he's loose.
Go for it.

37:50.736 --> 37:53.936
20 years on the job, never fired
my weapon before tonight.

37:54.056 --> 37:55.536
YOU shot him?

37:57.096 --> 37:59.216
I didn't get
a good look at him.

37:59.376 --> 38:01.415
All I saw was a weapon
pointed at me.

38:01.575 --> 38:03.855
Then you did
what you had to.

38:05.975 --> 38:07.895
It was part
of his costume.

38:09.255 --> 38:11.135
It was a toy gun.

38:19.335 --> 38:20.575
Keep pushing. Lean into it.

38:20.575 --> 38:23.055
Maybe you should
take over, Dr Morris.

38:23.055 --> 38:24.095
Need another doctor here?

38:24.335 --> 38:25.335
I got it!

38:25.455 --> 38:26.455
Way to go.

38:26.615 --> 38:28.495
Dr Brenner, glove up,
check the thoraseal.

38:28.615 --> 38:29.575
We were about to do that.

38:29.695 --> 38:31.135
Fair amount of blood.

38:31.255 --> 38:32.895
Have a thoracotomy tray ready.

38:33.015 --> 38:34.335
He's haemodynamically stable.

38:34.495 --> 38:35.815
For now -
you have to be prepared

38:35.935 --> 38:37.295
for anything and everything.

38:37.455 --> 38:38.975
You sound like a cop.

38:39.135 --> 38:41.015
Our jobs aren't
all that different.

38:41.135 --> 38:42.455
O-silk, please.

38:42.615 --> 38:44.255
Yeah, things can turn
on you real fast.

38:44.255 --> 38:46.455
OK, set up
for a portable chest.

38:46.455 --> 38:48.095
Let's step out
for the x-ray.

38:54.975 --> 38:56.215
When I was younger,

38:56.415 --> 39:00.975
I had a traffic stop -
guy's tail light was busted.

39:01.095 --> 39:03.895
Routine, right?

39:04.055 --> 39:06.975
My gut told me
something was wrong.

39:07.095 --> 39:08.655
I ignored it.

39:08.775 --> 39:11.495
As I was telling him
to get the light fixed,

39:11.615 --> 39:12.535
he pulled out a gun,

39:12.695 --> 39:15.175
shot his wife
in the passenger seat,

39:15.295 --> 39:16.735
then killed himself.

39:18.615 --> 39:20.135
That's horrible.

39:20.135 --> 39:24.295
Yeah. I took
a desk job after that.

39:24.455 --> 39:28.615
But pushing papers
isn't why I became a cop,

39:28.775 --> 39:32.215
so I go back out
on the street and...

39:32.375 --> 39:34.895
Officer Flores
is here for her partner.

39:34.895 --> 39:37.014
And friends of the patient
are in waiting.

39:37.014 --> 39:38.614
OK, have them wait there.

39:38.734 --> 39:40.054
Mark, what are you doing here?

39:40.054 --> 39:41.134
I gotta make sure
he pulls through.

39:41.214 --> 39:42.454
They sent us home.

39:42.614 --> 39:44.334
The brass finds you here,
finds me here talking to you,

39:44.454 --> 39:45.574
we're in big trouble.

39:45.694 --> 39:47.334
Systolic's down to 60.

39:47.494 --> 39:49.174
Squeeze in a litre.
Hang the O-neg.

39:49.174 --> 39:50.814
Call thoracic.
Have them take him to OR.

39:50.934 --> 39:51.934
Right now?

39:52.094 --> 39:53.094
We've got 1200ccs
of blood.

39:53.254 --> 39:55.014
C'mon, let the docs do their
job. Let me take you home.

39:55.014 --> 39:57.654
I'm not leaving!
It's my fault.

39:57.654 --> 39:58.574
You want to wait
till he arrests?

39:58.694 --> 40:00.054
I didn't mean to shoot him.

40:00.254 --> 40:01.774
I want to give
blood products to
see if he responds.

40:01.894 --> 40:03.974
He must've thought we
were guests at the party,

40:04.094 --> 40:05.334
dressed up as cops.

40:05.494 --> 40:08.254
Maybe you guys
should step outside.

40:08.374 --> 40:09.774
I'll come and find you.

40:09.774 --> 40:12.734
We can auto-transfuse.
Yes. Yes! he'll get

40:12.734 --> 40:14.494
his own red cells, platelets
and clotting factors.

40:14.614 --> 40:15.734
Decreases the risk.

40:15.734 --> 40:16.814
His output is
slowing down.

40:16.974 --> 40:18.694
Just give us 10 minutes,
we'll turn him around.

41:27.653 --> 41:28.733
Got a cold?

41:28.813 --> 41:30.053
Need help fast?

41:30.173 --> 41:31.693
Lemsip Max
All In One

41:31.773 --> 41:32.733
starts to get to work

41:46.693 --> 41:49.293

41:57.373 --> 41:59.813
with medicine that goes on working

41:59.893 --> 42:01.693
long after the lozenge has gone.

42:02.653 --> 42:04.253
Try new:

42:04.613 --> 42:06.573
There's nothing quite like it.

At Sainsbury's,

Fairy
dishwasher tablets

43:51.412 --> 43:53.092
are better
than half price.

43:53.212 --> 43:54.412
So stock up
the cupboard

43:54.532 --> 43:55.852
and then stack
the dishwasher!

45:09.131 --> 45:11.971
"What business do
I have?" you know?

45:12.131 --> 45:14.971
Now, I'm not saying I didn't
made mistakes with Sarah,

45:15.131 --> 45:17.971
but...things are good now
between us, you know?

45:18.131 --> 45:20.611
I've adjusted.
She's adjusted.

45:21.771 --> 45:25.451
Just like I know you will
with your new family situation.

45:26.491 --> 45:28.851
And soon, I hope, huh?

45:29.971 --> 45:32.651
Hey! Hold that
door, will ya?

45:32.811 --> 45:33.891
Come on, kid,
we're out of here.

45:34.051 --> 45:35.131
Let's go.
We're free.

45:36.531 --> 45:37.891
Come on, Owen.

45:38.931 --> 45:41.491
Come on.

45:45.531 --> 45:47.611
These are my favourite.

46:04.210 --> 46:05.970
Only 100ccs
of additional blood.

46:06.130 --> 46:08.410
BP is 110 over 75.
Heart rate's 85.

46:08.410 --> 46:09.570
Best so far.

46:09.570 --> 46:10.650
All right!

46:10.850 --> 46:12.210
Angio's waiting
to squirt his arm

46:12.370 --> 46:14.450
and vascular's ready
to repair the brachial artery.

46:14.610 --> 46:16.930
Have the blood bank
stay two units ahead.

46:18.850 --> 46:21.490
You know, you should really
try to control your enthusiasm.

46:21.610 --> 46:22.690
Excuse me?

46:22.850 --> 46:24.890
We just kicked ass
in there.

46:25.010 --> 46:26.450
Why not enjoy
the victory a little?

46:26.610 --> 46:27.930
Because we need to
remain vigilant.

46:28.090 --> 46:29.370
A patient can
crash and burn

46:29.530 --> 46:30.610
while you're doing
your victory dance.

46:30.730 --> 46:32.650
Listen, Cate...

46:32.650 --> 46:34.850
Anyone call you that?

46:34.850 --> 46:36.010
Once.

46:36.130 --> 46:37.090
OK.

46:37.250 --> 46:38.970
We work under
a lot of stress,

46:39.130 --> 46:40.530
so when something
good does happen,

46:40.690 --> 46:42.770
why not enjoy it,
just have some fun?

46:42.930 --> 46:45.330
There is no room for that
kind of levity in the ER.

46:45.490 --> 46:47.010
No offence,
but if that's your attitude,

46:47.170 --> 46:48.370
then your day is always
going to suck.

46:49.730 --> 46:52.010
Night, Frank.

46:52.010 --> 46:54.770
Have a good one.
Thanks.

46:55.850 --> 46:58.090
Sam! Where you going?

46:58.090 --> 46:59.610
My review class.

46:59.610 --> 47:00.850
I thought you were gonna
blow that off.

47:00.850 --> 47:02.130
Yeah, well...

47:02.130 --> 47:04.530
going to school isn't just a
cutesy little hobby, you know?

47:04.530 --> 47:06.450
What are you talking about?
You know I support this.

47:06.450 --> 47:07.770
Oh, I know - when it's
convenient for you,

47:07.770 --> 47:08.850
if it doesn't interfere
with your life.

47:08.850 --> 47:10.890
That's not true.

47:10.890 --> 47:13.250
I know you have an outdated,
sexist view of what nurses do,

47:13.410 --> 47:15.010
but we do a helluva lot
more than change bedpans.

47:15.130 --> 47:16.290
I know that, Sam.

47:16.290 --> 47:17.210
Well, I wish you
would respect

47:17.370 --> 47:18.610
what I'm trying to do,
what I'm trying to learn.

47:18.770 --> 47:20.490
Hi, guys. You guys want
a tall triple decaf latte?

47:20.490 --> 47:22.250
Heaven forbid you get an intern
to do your scut work.

47:22.250 --> 47:24.410
And trying to show
off to Daria by
making me look small?

47:24.570 --> 47:26.250
You know what?
That is never gonna fly.

47:26.410 --> 47:27.570
Hey, teaching the interns
is part of my job.

47:27.690 --> 47:30.490
What do you want me to do?

47:30.490 --> 47:31.530
Nothing. Forget it.

47:31.650 --> 47:32.730
You're nervous.

47:32.890 --> 47:35.450
Let's go home and
I'll help you study.

47:35.530 --> 47:37.169
OK.

47:37.289 --> 47:38.849
All right, well, uh...

47:39.009 --> 47:41.849
What is the anaesthetic of choice
for open heart surgery?

47:43.929 --> 47:45.929
Yeah, that's what I thought.

47:45.929 --> 47:47.489
Don't be like that.

47:47.609 --> 47:49.929
I gotta go.

48:03.609 --> 48:06.409
Any word on Danny?

48:06.409 --> 48:09.249
They removed a small blood clot
from his brain,

48:09.249 --> 48:11.569
said he'll be
in recovery soon.

48:13.129 --> 48:14.409
Where's Scott?

48:14.409 --> 48:17.049
Upstairs, waiting
for his brother.

48:19.249 --> 48:20.849
They're good kids.

48:20.849 --> 48:23.529
Why don't you stop
screwing them up?

48:23.529 --> 48:26.449
What do you know about it?

48:26.449 --> 48:27.449
Well, for starters,

48:27.609 --> 48:28.609
you're sleeping
with a high school boy...

48:28.729 --> 48:29.889
Mike is 18. We're adults.

48:30.009 --> 48:31.169
No, he's a kid.

48:31.329 --> 48:33.009
And he sees you as nothing
more than an easy lay

48:33.209 --> 48:34.409
and he's not afraid
to say it.

48:34.569 --> 48:36.369
Mike didn't mean to say
those things.

48:36.489 --> 48:37.449
He loves me.

48:37.609 --> 48:40.249
You know what?
He really doesn't.

48:40.409 --> 48:41.929
I'm not talking to you
about this.

48:42.089 --> 48:43.969
Yeah, well, you'll talk
with the social services.

48:44.089 --> 48:45.689
And the boys, too.

48:45.849 --> 48:47.649
I called them.
You have no right.

48:47.649 --> 48:50.609
Look, Scott has seen
way more than he ever should've

48:50.609 --> 48:52.089
and he's trying to protect
his brother.

48:52.249 --> 48:53.729
But he's not the parent -
you are.

48:53.889 --> 48:55.769
So why don't you start
acting like it?

48:55.769 --> 48:57.529
You have done a number
on these kids

48:57.689 --> 48:59.929
and that is gonna last
a long time.

49:00.049 --> 49:01.249
Go to hell.

49:01.449 --> 49:03.689
Just fix your life, lady,
it's not too late.

49:16.168 --> 49:17.808
Thank you.

49:17.928 --> 49:19.888
You know, I...

49:20.048 --> 49:22.168
wish I could've
been there for you

49:22.328 --> 49:24.408
when you were going
through all of that.

49:24.528 --> 49:27.248
Well...

49:27.408 --> 49:32.088
we weren't really on a talking
basis for a while, so...

49:32.208 --> 49:33.368
SLOW SONG PLAYS

49:33.528 --> 49:35.048
Love this song.
Cool tune.

49:36.888 --> 49:38.648
Give me that.

49:42.768 --> 49:44.648
Come here.

49:46.888 --> 49:48.568
You know...

49:49.968 --> 49:52.048
..I felt responsible
for what happened.

49:53.768 --> 49:56.088
I still do sometimes.

49:58.928 --> 50:01.808
Neela, I was drunk and stupid

50:01.808 --> 50:04.288
and I was standing
in the middle of the road

50:04.288 --> 50:05.728
in the middle of the night.

50:05.728 --> 50:06.928
But the way I
handled things...

50:06.928 --> 50:08.048
Neela.

50:09.608 --> 50:10.848
Let it go.

50:13.208 --> 50:14.408
I have.

50:19.448 --> 50:21.128
KNOCKING

50:21.288 --> 50:24.128
It's probably
trick-or-treaters.

50:24.288 --> 50:26.408
Let's ignore them,
they'll go away.

50:26.528 --> 50:28.608
So, you were saying...

50:34.528 --> 50:36.928
After the accident, um...

50:36.928 --> 50:42.848
I had a lot of time
to...look at my life.

50:43.008 --> 50:48.127
And what I had to do
to get back on my feet again -

50:48.127 --> 50:50.367
literally -

50:50.367 --> 50:53.567
and it's...

50:53.567 --> 50:57.727
given everything
that happened before...

50:57.727 --> 51:00.447
it's put that
into perspective.

51:08.407 --> 51:09.767
KNOCKING

51:09.767 --> 51:12.007
Bollocks.
Um, let me get rid of them.

51:12.007 --> 51:13.327
OK.

51:13.327 --> 51:16.967
Sorry, kids,
I'm all out of candy.

51:16.967 --> 51:18.447
You owe me $80.

51:18.447 --> 51:20.247
What are you doing here?

51:20.407 --> 51:23.247
Um, I'm sorry,
I didn't realise...

51:23.367 --> 51:24.447
Give me a minute, OK?

51:24.607 --> 51:25.967
Sure.
OK.

51:27.127 --> 51:29.047
You can't just
show up like this.
I...

51:29.047 --> 51:30.767
You know, there's nothing
going on between us.

51:30.927 --> 51:32.087
We work together,
and that's it.

51:32.207 --> 51:34.167
I know, I just...I...

51:34.327 --> 51:37.887
I thought we could have a drink,
and...like a celebration.

51:38.047 --> 51:39.527
Dr Gawande agreed
to do Grand Rounds.

51:39.687 --> 51:41.767
Good for you, but, as you
can see, I've got company.

51:41.887 --> 51:45.127
Right, Ray.

51:46.007 --> 51:48.767
OK, well...I'll go.

51:48.767 --> 51:50.927
Yeah, please do.
So, I'll...

51:51.047 --> 51:54.087
I-I'll see you at work.

51:54.247 --> 51:57.327
I'm sorry.
I didn't invite him.

51:57.487 --> 51:59.967
It's getting late.
I should go.

52:00.087 --> 52:01.527
You don't have to.

52:01.687 --> 52:05.327
It's been a great day,
a fun night,

52:05.327 --> 52:07.807
but I have that conference
in the morning, so...

52:07.807 --> 52:10.807
You can stay here instead of
driving to the hotel.

52:14.527 --> 52:16.527
I'm in a good place now.

52:18.447 --> 52:21.407
And you seem good, too.

52:21.407 --> 52:23.246
So...

52:27.086 --> 52:29.286
I'm gonna go.

52:39.406 --> 52:41.126
See you soon.

53:04.366 --> 53:06.886
Mr Mackey's
out of surgery.

53:06.886 --> 53:08.006
The bleeding in his chest

53:08.166 --> 53:10.486
was from small vessels that
clotted off on their own.

53:10.646 --> 53:12.766
A bullet tore through
the artery in his upper arm,

53:12.926 --> 53:15.846
but the surgeons
got to it quickly.

53:15.966 --> 53:17.686
So is he gonna be OK?

53:17.806 --> 53:18.806
He should be fine.

53:18.966 --> 53:21.726
No residual paralysis
or disability.

53:21.846 --> 53:25.886
Oh, good. Oh...

53:25.886 --> 53:27.326
That's good to hear.

53:28.406 --> 53:30.646
That's good to hear.

53:35.526 --> 53:38.126
You do what you can,

53:38.286 --> 53:41.566
but you can't be prepared
for everything.

53:42.766 --> 53:44.806
Make a mistake
in some office job -

53:44.806 --> 53:46.246
what happens?
Nothing much.

53:46.406 --> 53:51.846
On our watch, people
get hurt, people die.

53:52.006 --> 53:57.765
Yeah, but you can't let it
take away all the good.

54:02.365 --> 54:05.405
I suggest you leave
before you're seen.

54:05.525 --> 54:06.565
If you get your partner,

54:06.725 --> 54:08.765
I'll show you a side door
that you can use.

54:08.765 --> 54:10.285
Yeah.

54:10.285 --> 54:13.605
Thanks.

54:25.885 --> 54:29.045
# So you think you've found the one

54:33.445 --> 54:36.565
# And she knows just how you feel

54:39.085 --> 54:42.485
# So I think that you should go

54:42.485 --> 54:45.645
# So I think that you should go

54:47.045 --> 54:50.285
# Go on ahead

54:50.285 --> 54:54.205
# Go on ahead

54:54.205 --> 54:57.005
# Take her in your arms

54:57.005 --> 55:00.405
# And be wed

55:04.645 --> 55:08.405
# And go, go, go

55:08.405 --> 55:10.725
# Go, go

55:10.725 --> 55:12.525
# You restless souls

55:12.525 --> 55:14.205
# You're gonna find it

55:16.125 --> 55:20.885
# Go, go, go, go, go

55:20.885 --> 55:23.005
# You restless souls

55:23.005 --> 55:24.725
# You're gonna find it

55:26.245 --> 55:30.205
# Oh, yes, you can

55:30.205 --> 55:31.885
# You've found it. #

56:59.124 --> 57:01.444
I've succeeded in business
because I've employed people

57:01.604 --> 57:04.524
with dedication,
motivation and persistence.

57:04.644 --> 57:07.204
When I met some apprentices recently

57:07.364 --> 57:09.883
I was really impressed
by their attitude.

57:10.043 --> 57:12.923
They're ambitious, they're doers,
they make things happen.

57:13.083 --> 57:15.803
These are the type of qualities
that I look for in people.

57:15.923 --> 57:17.083
It's amazing,

57:17.243 --> 57:20.883
there are over 200,000
apprentices in this country.

57:21.043 --> 57:24.803
And it's easier to get an apprentice
on board than you may think.

57:25.883 --> 57:28.603
Success is down to finding
people like this -

57:28.723 --> 57:31.283
people that make businesses grow.

57:31.403 --> 57:32.803
To find out how Apprenticeships

57:32.963 --> 57:34.363
could make things happen
for your business,

57:34.483 --> 57:35.803
visit our website.

57:49.243 --> 57:50.803
I'm happy because I'm online!

57:50.883 --> 57:52.523
You think I'm selling car insurance?

57:52.603 --> 57:54.363
Well I'm not, I'm selling time...

57:54.443 --> 57:56.043
..and time is money.

57:56.243 --> 57:58.003
Get a life!
Get Swiftcovered!

58:00.123 --> 58:01.323
We're staying here?

58:01.923 --> 58:03.763
Have I ever
let you down?

58:04.603 --> 58:05.443
THUNDER

58:05.563 --> 58:06.803
(whimpers)

58:06.923 --> 58:08.803
Trust me, this is big-time!

58:09.603 --> 58:10.683
Good afternoon, sir.

58:10.803 --> 58:11.963
It is now.

58:12.963 --> 58:15.523
Ah! Now, that's what
I'm talking about. (chuckles)

58:15.643 --> 58:17.483
I love you too, baby!

58:17.643 --> 58:20.123
Fantastic. And just some bread
for my companion, please.

58:20.923 --> 58:23.083
Hey! I found something small-time.

58:23.723 --> 58:24.763
The bill!

58:25.603 --> 58:26.563
Premier Inn.

01:00:55.841 --> 01:00:57.441
Previously...
I can't have sex with you.

01:00:57.441 --> 01:01:00.961
No, I don't want to have sex,
either. I mean, not now.

01:01:00.961 --> 01:01:03.561
What's this?
It's my letter of resignation.

01:01:03.561 --> 01:01:06.841
It doesn't feel like our
company anymore. I'm quitting.

01:01:06.841 --> 01:01:09.961
I am starting up a non-profit,
so welcome to the nerve center.

01:01:09.961 --> 01:01:11.361
I never heard my parents
use the word "gay"

01:01:11.361 --> 01:01:12.641
until I told them I was.

01:01:12.641 --> 01:01:14.201
What you two are doing,

01:01:14.201 --> 01:01:16.601
it's not a union
recognized by the Church.

01:01:16.601 --> 01:01:18.001
I'd like you to consider
replacing Kitty

01:01:18.001 --> 01:01:21.001
as my communications director.
This is so insane.

01:01:21.001 --> 01:01:23.561
I've got everything
the state has on Ryan Lafferty.

01:01:23.561 --> 01:01:26.201
Let me earn the trust back.

01:01:26.201 --> 01:01:28.601
If I agree to do this, Mom,
no more lies.

01:01:28.601 --> 01:01:31.281
From now on, no more lies.

01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:40.761
KNOCKING

01:01:43.161 --> 01:01:44.361
Hey.

01:01:44.361 --> 01:01:46.641
Hey.
Mm. Oh, hot liquids.

01:01:46.641 --> 01:01:48.041
Um, I can do
two things at once.

01:01:48.041 --> 01:01:51.041
Justin, I really need to
talk to you about something.

01:01:51.041 --> 01:01:51.481
Sure.
OK.
