00:23.300 --> 00:26.400
<gasp>
IT BEGINS.

00:27.167 --> 00:29.634

00:37.601 --> 00:41.567

00:42.667 --> 00:44.267

00:51.634 --> 00:52.901
<i>BRENNAN MULWRAY?</i>

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
YEAH. WHO'S THIS?

00:54.100 --> 00:55.367
JUST LISTEN.

00:55.467 --> 00:57.968
MY NAME IS NATHAN
REYNOLDS, OKAY?

00:58.067 --> 00:59.701
<i>I... I'M NOT
ON DRUGS.</i>

00:59.801 --> 01:00.801
<i>I... I'M
NOT CRAZY.</i>

01:00.901 --> 01:02.534
I... I'M SURE AS
HELL NOT WRONG.

01:02.634 --> 01:05.066
THE PROPHECY HAS COME TRUE.

01:05.167 --> 01:07.534
AND YOU AND I ARE PART OF IT.

01:07.634 --> 01:09.467
DUDE, YOU GOTTA SLOW DOWN
AND START MAKING SOME SENSE

01:09.567 --> 01:10.767
OR I'M HANGING UP.

01:10.868 --> 01:13.267
<panting>

01:13.367 --> 01:14.234
OH GOD.

01:14.334 --> 01:15.467
IT'S TOO LATE FOR ME.

01:15.567 --> 01:16.701
HE'S COME...

01:16.801 --> 01:18.133
WHO?

01:18.234 --> 01:19.801
<i>HE'LL KILL ME.
AFTER, YOU NEXT.</i>

01:19.901 --> 01:21.834
JUST SAVE YOURSELF AND THE
OTHERS, BEFORE IT'S TOO...

01:21.934 --> 01:24.767
<screaming>

01:24.868 --> 01:26.133
DON'T HANG UP!

01:26.234 --> 01:27.501
HELLO!

01:27.601 --> 01:29.534
HELLO?

01:34.234 --> 01:35.834
HOW'D THIS GUY
FIND YOUR NUMBER?

01:35.934 --> 01:37.167
I DON'T KNOW.

01:37.267 --> 01:38.734
THERE'S BEEN FAR TOO MUCH
OF THAT HAPPENING LATELY.

01:38.834 --> 01:40.634
I THINK WE NEED AN
ANSWERING SERVICE.

01:40.734 --> 01:41.801
YEAH.

01:41.901 --> 01:43.234
WHAT, LIKE "MUTANT X CAN'T
COME TO THE PHONE NOW?

01:43.334 --> 01:45.200
WE'RE BUSY SAVING THE WORLD
...AGAIN."

01:45.300 --> 01:46.767
YEAH, SOMETHING
LIKE THAT.

01:46.868 --> 01:48.767
<growling>

01:48.868 --> 01:51.000
WELL, I GUESS IT
WASN'T A CRANK CALL.

01:51.100 --> 01:52.767
DEFINITELY FOUND
OUR PHONE.

01:52.868 --> 01:54.767
NOW WHERE'S OUR CALLER?

01:56.100 --> 01:58.701
WHAT IS THIS STUFF?
SOME SORT OF ACID?

01:58.801 --> 02:01.167
<panting>

02:01.267 --> 02:02.467
BRENNAN!

02:09.434 --> 02:11.634
HEY, FREAK BOY!

02:16.100 --> 02:18.067
WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT?

02:19.367 --> 02:20.534
HE'LL BE BACK!

02:20.634 --> 02:22.434
YOU TWO SHOULD GET OUTTA HERE.

02:23.100 --> 02:25.133
HELLO? KEN? BARBIE?

02:25.234 --> 02:25.934
CHOP-CHOP.

02:26.033 --> 02:27.067
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE

02:27.167 --> 02:29.234
UNTIL I FIGURE OUT WHO
MADE THAT CALL FOR HELP.

02:29.334 --> 02:32.133
BREN?

02:35.367 --> 02:37.100
HATE TO BREAK THIS
TO YOU, HERO.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.901
BUT I THINK YOU'RE
A LITTLE LATE.

02:43.968 --> 02:48.767
<i>SCIENTIST ADAM KANE WAS A
PIONEER OF GENETIC RESEARCH,</i>

02:48.868 --> 02:52.901
<i>MANIPULATING DNA TO
SAVE HUMAN LIVES.</i>

02:53.000 --> 02:56.133
<i>BUT IN MANY THEIR GENES
UNEXPECTEDLY MUTATED</i>

02:56.234 --> 02:59.167
<i>AND THEY DEVELOPED
SUPERHUMAN ABILITIES.</i>

03:28.634 --> 03:31.300
<i>TOGETHER, FOUR OF THE
MOST POWERFUL FIGHT</i>

03:31.400 --> 03:35.000
<i>TO PROTECT A WORLD THAT
DOESN'T EVEN KNOW THEY EXIST.</i>

03:37.200 --> 03:40.801
<i>THEY ARE... MUTANT X.</i>

03:51.100 --> 03:52.334
HEY... HEY...

03:52.434 --> 03:53.634
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING?

03:53.734 --> 03:54.901
WHAT?

03:55.000 --> 03:56.267
CAN'T A GIRL JUST TAKE A
STROLL DOWN AN ALLEY ANYMORE?

03:56.367 --> 03:57.567
LOOK, JUST CUT THE CRAP, OKAY?

03:57.667 --> 03:59.067
OBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW SOMETHING.

03:59.167 --> 04:00.267
ALL RIGHT...

04:00.367 --> 04:01.868
THE GUY THAT JUMPED YOU
IS CALLED THE GUARDIAN.

04:01.968 --> 04:03.934
I'VE BEEN ON HIS TRAIL
FOR THE LAST MONTH.

04:04.033 --> 04:05.000
WHY?

04:05.100 --> 04:06.267
I'M A BOUNTY HUNTER.

04:06.367 --> 04:09.234
HE'S BEEN WATCHING A
PACKAGE THAT I'M AFTER.

04:09.334 --> 04:10.434
YOUR TURN.

04:10.534 --> 04:12.133
WHAT'S YOUR PART IN THIS?

04:12.234 --> 04:13.901
AND DON'T BOTHER LYING.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.534
I'LL KNOW.

04:15.634 --> 04:17.634
YOU AN EMPATH?

04:17.733 --> 04:18.868
TELEPATH.

04:18.968 --> 04:20.434
GOOD FOR YOU.

04:26.467 --> 04:28.467
WELL, THERE'S NOT REALLY
A WHOLE LOT TO TELL.

04:28.567 --> 04:30.667
GET A PHONE CALL FROM THIS GUY,
SAID HIS NAME'S NATHAN,

04:30.767 --> 04:33.000
AND THERE'S SOME PROPHECY
THAT I'M A PART OF.

04:33.100 --> 04:34.567
DID HE SAY ANYTHING ELSE?

04:34.667 --> 04:35.567
DETAILS?

04:35.667 --> 04:37.567
MOSTLY, I JUST
HEARD HIM SCREAMING.

04:37.667 --> 04:39.601
SO IF I'M INVOLVED IN THIS AND
YOU'RE GOING AFTER THAT KILLER,

04:39.701 --> 04:40.767
THEN I'M GOING WITH YOU.

04:40.868 --> 04:41.934
OH, REALLY?

04:42.033 --> 04:43.367
BECAUSE I MUST'VE MISSED
THE PART WHERE I...

04:43.467 --> 04:44.701
INVITED YOU.

04:44.801 --> 04:46.934
I GUESS WE COULD ALWAYS GO AND
FIND HIM OURSELVES, BUT...

04:47.033 --> 04:49.334
THEN YOU'D RISK US
FINDING HIM FIRST.

04:56.067 --> 04:57.634
ALL RIGHT.

04:57.734 --> 04:59.901
YOU CAN TAG ALONG.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.467
THE FERAL GOES HOME.

05:05.968 --> 05:08.400
DEAL.

05:17.534 --> 05:19.501
IT'S COOL.

05:28.300 --> 05:30.167
<sigh>

05:31.834 --> 05:33.534
OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE,
MAKE A MOVE ALREADY.

05:33.634 --> 05:35.000
I'M HEARING CRICKETS.

05:35.100 --> 05:36.701
RELAX.

05:36.801 --> 05:40.033
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN TELL A LOT
ABOUT A PERSON'S ROMANTIC STYLE

05:40.133 --> 05:43.000
BY THE WAY THEY PLAY GAMES.

05:43.100 --> 05:46.934
FOR SOME, IT'S JUST
ALL ABOUT THE FINISH.

05:47.033 --> 05:51.400
BUT FOR OTHERS, WELL,
THEY TAKE THEIR TIME.

05:51.501 --> 05:54.300
ENJOYING THE MOVES
IT TAKES TO...

05:54.400 --> 05:56.968
GET YOU THERE.

06:01.801 --> 06:04.934
WELL, FAST OR SLOW...

06:05.033 --> 06:07.300
AS LONG AS I WIN.

06:07.400 --> 06:10.300
CHECKMATE.

06:10.400 --> 06:14.534
JESSE, I NEED YOU TO
ANALYSE THIS FOR ME.

06:14.634 --> 06:16.467
GOOD TO SEE YOU, TOO.

06:16.567 --> 06:17.667
WHAT HAPPENED
AT THE MEET?

06:17.767 --> 06:19.100
BY THE TIME
WE GOT THERE,

06:19.200 --> 06:21.033
BRENNAN'S CONTACT
WAS ALREADY DEAD.

06:21.133 --> 06:22.567
WELL, WHERE
IS BRENNAN?

06:22.667 --> 06:23.968
HELL IF I KNOW.

06:24.100 --> 06:25.601
RAN INTO A BOUNTY HUNTER
AND HE TOOK OFF WITH HER

06:25.701 --> 06:27.033
TO FOLLOW THE KILLER.

06:27.133 --> 06:29.234
I WAS CORDIALLY DIS-INVITED.

06:29.334 --> 06:30.534
WHAT IS THIS?

06:30.634 --> 06:31.901
IT'S THE ONLY
EVIDENCE I COULD GET.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.167
IT WAS ALL OVER THE SCENE.

06:33.267 --> 06:34.767
I'M GUESSING THAT'S
HOW THE GUY WAS KILLED.

06:34.868 --> 06:36.601
HE WAS SLIMED.

06:36.701 --> 06:38.167
COOL.

06:38.267 --> 06:41.367
YOU ARE SO WEIRD,
SOMETIMES.

06:48.934 --> 06:50.968
SO, HOW HOT IS SHE?

06:51.067 --> 06:53.067
WHO?

06:53.167 --> 06:54.234
<whistles>

06:54.334 --> 06:56.934
THAT HOT, HUH?

06:58.100 --> 07:00.234
LOOK, SHAL, SPEAKING
AS A FRIEND...

07:00.334 --> 07:01.467
HUH.

07:01.567 --> 07:04.133
OKAY, FINE,
SPEAKING AS ME,

07:04.234 --> 07:06.834
YOU'VE REALLY GOT TO CLEAR
UP YOUR BRENNAN ISSUES.

07:06.934 --> 07:08.167
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

07:08.267 --> 07:09.801
I'M TALKING ABOUT EVERY TIME
HE GETS NEAR ANOTHER GIRL,

07:09.901 --> 07:11.734
YOUR HACKLES GO UP.

07:11.834 --> 07:13.968
OKAY, FIRST,
YOU'RE WAY OFF.

07:14.067 --> 07:17.567
<i>AND SECOND,
YOU ARE WAY OFF.</i>

07:17.667 --> 07:19.067
WE'RE LIKE FAMILY.

07:19.167 --> 07:20.367
YEAH?

07:20.467 --> 07:22.501
I HOPE YOU
LIKE IT THAT WAY.

07:22.601 --> 07:23.934
BECAUSE UNTIL YOU GET HONEST
WITH YOURSELF...

07:24.033 --> 07:25.033
AND BRENNAN...

07:25.133 --> 07:26.634
THAT'S ALL YOU
TWO WILL EVER BE.

07:26.734 --> 07:28.701
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, SHAL?

07:28.801 --> 07:31.167
HE HAS EVERY RIGHT
TO KEEP LOOKING.

07:50.501 --> 07:52.601
MIND TELLING
ME WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE?

07:52.701 --> 07:54.167
WELL, I'M NOT SURE
WHERE TO FIND THE GUY

07:54.267 --> 07:55.634
THAT JUMPED YOU BUT...

07:55.734 --> 07:58.534
...I'M PRETTY SURE
WHO HE'S AFTER NEXT.

07:59.868 --> 08:01.734
SHE'S A FERAL NAMED
CAROL WHITELY.

08:01.834 --> 08:04.100
IF WE CAN FIND HER, WE
CAN SET UP A SWEET AMBUSH.

08:04.200 --> 08:06.300
WHAT? SHE JUST HANGS
OUT IN ALLEYS?

08:06.400 --> 08:08.234
NO. BUT HER
DEALER DOES.

08:08.334 --> 08:11.100
WE JUST HAVE TO SHAKE HIM DOWN.

08:11.200 --> 08:14.868
UNDERSTANDING PEOPLE'S
WEAKNESSES IS HALF OF MY JOB.

08:14.968 --> 08:16.300
REALLY?

08:16.400 --> 08:17.534
MM.

08:17.634 --> 08:19.534
SO WHAT'S YOUR WEAKNESS?

08:19.634 --> 08:22.234
PRETTY BOYS THAT ASK
TOO MANY QUESTIONS?

08:22.334 --> 08:23.400
YOU?

08:23.501 --> 08:25.701
AGGRESSIVE CHICKS WITH
A SUPERIORITY COMPLEX.

08:25.801 --> 08:27.234
HM.

08:27.334 --> 08:29.701
I'M COMING UP WITH NOTHING
ON THIS BOUNTY HUNTER SO FAR.

08:29.801 --> 08:31.667
I MEAN, RILEY'S
PROBABLY AN ALIAS.

08:31.767 --> 08:33.333
MAYBE IT'S HER STRIPPER NAME.

08:33.433 --> 08:35.601
<i>ME-YOW!</i>

08:35.701 --> 08:36.967
ANYTHING?

08:37.067 --> 08:39.534
WELL, IT COULD BE THE ICKIEST
SUBSTANCE I'VE NEVER ANALYSED,

08:39.634 --> 08:41.833
BUT IT'S DEFINITELY
THE MOST INTRIGUING.

08:41.933 --> 08:43.267
WHAT IS THIS?

08:43.366 --> 08:44.601
WELL, IT'S A MUCUS.

08:44.701 --> 08:47.567
MORE OF A VISCOUS
CEMENT, REALLY.

08:47.667 --> 08:49.934
DOES IT TELL US ANYTHING ABOUT
THE GUY THAT ATTACKED US?

08:50.033 --> 08:52.133
WELL, I'M READY TO
CHECK THE DATABASE.

08:54.868 --> 08:55.868
OHH...

08:55.968 --> 08:57.667
HE'S CALLED THE GUARDIAN.

08:57.767 --> 09:00.033
CATCHY NAME, HUH?

09:00.133 --> 09:01.334
WHAT IS HE?

09:01.434 --> 09:02.767
HE'S NOT SOME KIND OF FERAL.

09:02.868 --> 09:04.033
WELL, HE'S SIMILAR.

09:04.133 --> 09:05.200
I MEAN, HE'S A TRANSGENIC
HYBRID LIKE YOU,

09:05.300 --> 09:06.968
BUT HE'S ARACHNID-BASED.

09:07.067 --> 09:09.167
I'M GUESSING THEY CROSSED
HIM WITH A HOBO SPIDER

09:09.267 --> 09:10.667
AND A WHIP SCORPION.

09:10.767 --> 09:11.968
THAT'S NOT A GOOD THING.

09:12.067 --> 09:14.834
NO, THAT'S A VERY
NOT GOOD THING.

09:14.934 --> 09:16.868
I MEAN, OF THE FOUR MUTATIONS,

09:16.968 --> 09:20.100
FERALS' PERSONALITIES ARE MOST
DEPENDENT ON THE DNA, RIGHT?

09:20.200 --> 09:21.367
YEAH, SO?

09:21.467 --> 09:23.767
SO A MAMMALIAN CROSS LIKE
ME, THAT'S ONE THING, BUT...

09:23.868 --> 09:25.267
AN ARACHNID,
THAT'S GOING TO BE

09:25.367 --> 09:27.067
A WHOLE OTHER KETTLE
OF WEIRDNESS.

09:27.167 --> 09:28.200
HE'S NOT GOING TO
THINK LIKE US,

09:28.300 --> 09:29.367
HE'S NOT GOING
TO FEEL LIKE US.

09:29.467 --> 09:31.033
HE'S GOING TO BE
TOTALLY UNPREDICTABLE.

09:31.133 --> 09:33.634
HE'LL BE INSTINCT
OVER INTELLECT.

09:37.067 --> 09:38.834
THERE'S OUR GUY.

09:38.934 --> 09:40.033
UH, HELLO?

09:40.133 --> 09:41.734
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:41.834 --> 09:43.200
I'M GETTING OUT OF THE CAR?

09:43.300 --> 09:46.801
LOOK, YOU AREN'T USED TO THIS
KIND OF SUBTLE INTERROGATION,

09:46.901 --> 09:47.968
ALL RIGHT?

09:48.067 --> 09:49.868
IT TAKES FINESSE.

09:49.968 --> 09:51.467
STYLE.

09:51.567 --> 09:53.501
OH, I GOT YOUR
STYLE RIGHT HERE.

09:53.601 --> 09:54.567
NO.

09:54.667 --> 09:56.868
YOU GOT VOLTAGE.

10:00.901 --> 10:03.000
YOU CAN'T JUST FRY YOUR
SNITCHES, ALL RIGHT?

10:03.100 --> 10:04.501
THEY'LL NEVER
HELP YOU AGAIN.

10:04.601 --> 10:07.400
INFORMANTS ARE LIKE
TREES FOR BOUNTY HUNTERS.

10:07.501 --> 10:10.667
A RENEWABLE RESOURCE.

10:10.767 --> 10:13.434
HEY, IS THERE A BOOKS-ON-TAPE
VERSION OF THIS LECTURE?

10:13.534 --> 10:14.934
BECAUSE IT'S MAKING
ME KIND OF SLEEPY.

10:15.033 --> 10:16.834
STAND BACK
AND WATCH, G. Q...

10:16.934 --> 10:20.100
YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY
LEARN SOMETHING.

10:20.200 --> 10:21.400
YO, DOOLEY.

10:21.501 --> 10:23.133
YOU GOT A SECOND?

10:27.534 --> 10:28.400
NICE WORK, PROFESSOR.

10:28.501 --> 10:29.868
YOU KNOW THE RULES, DOOLEY!

10:29.968 --> 10:33.400
MAKE ME RUN,
I'LL MAKE YOU BLEED.

10:36.834 --> 10:38.901
YOU WERE SAYING...

10:39.000 --> 10:40.133
YOU TWO GOT A PROBLEM?

10:40.234 --> 10:41.300
ME? NAH.

10:41.400 --> 10:42.834
I'M JUST HERE TO LEARN.

10:44.234 --> 10:45.400
OH, HEY...

10:45.501 --> 10:46.767
I WAS CHECKING A LITTLE
DEEPER INTO THE GUARDIAN,

10:46.868 --> 10:49.200
AND GUESS WHO HE
USED TO PARTY WITH?

10:49.300 --> 10:51.901
GABRIEL ASHLOCKE.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

10:53.100 --> 10:54.334
NOT EVEN A LITTLE.

10:54.434 --> 10:55.734
THE GUARDIAN WAS PART OF
SOMETHING CALLED THE LINKS...

10:55.834 --> 10:57.267
YEAH,
WE KNOW ABOUT THE LINKS.

10:57.367 --> 10:59.367
THEY WERE ASHLOCKE'S
MUTANT FOLLOWERS.

10:59.467 --> 11:00.501
TOTALLY OBSESSED WITH HIM,

11:00.601 --> 11:02.167
WANTED TO HELP HIM
TAKE OVER THE WORLD.

11:02.267 --> 11:04.400
NOT HAPPY MEMORIES.

11:04.501 --> 11:05.734
OH.

11:05.834 --> 11:07.334
WELL, DO YOU GUYS KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM

11:07.434 --> 11:09.467
AFTER ASHLOCKE DIED?

11:09.567 --> 11:10.934
MOST OF THEM DRIFTED.

11:11.033 --> 11:13.100
BUT, A HARD CORE
PART OF THE LINKS,

11:13.200 --> 11:14.467
LIKE OUR LITTLE
BUG BOY HERE,

11:14.567 --> 11:17.834
THEY SPLINTERED OFF,
INCLUDING THIS GUY.

11:17.934 --> 11:19.734
MR. JOHN BISHOP,
THEIR PET PSIONIC.

11:19.834 --> 11:21.334
THE MOST POWERFUL
PRECOG ON THE MAP.

11:21.434 --> 11:22.367
LOOKS LIKE THE KIND OF GUY

11:22.467 --> 11:23.601
THAT COULD BE INTO
THE PROPHECY BIZ, HUH?

11:23.701 --> 11:25.234
YOU THINK HE'S STILL IN
CONTACT WITH THE GUARDIAN?

11:25.334 --> 11:27.667
WELL, I THINKING JESS AND
I SHOULD PAY HIM A VISIT,

11:27.767 --> 11:30.534
FIND OUT.

11:30.634 --> 11:32.234
IT'S JUST THAT BISHOP'S
LOCKED UP IN AN ASYLUM

11:32.334 --> 11:34.000
AND I KNOW HOW MUCH
THEY FREAK YOU OUT.

11:34.100 --> 11:37.267
SO DOES EVERYTHING HAVING
TO DO WITH ASHLOCKE.

11:37.367 --> 11:38.901
I'LL GO.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.934
LET ME...

11:43.901 --> 11:46.734
ARE YOU SERIOUSLY GOING TO
JUST STAND THERE POSING?

11:46.834 --> 11:48.767
YOU NEED HELP?

11:53.033 --> 11:54.534
YOU WERE SAYING?

11:58.801 --> 12:00.033
YOU MIGHT WANT
TO WAIT A SECOND

12:00.133 --> 12:02.434
WHILE THE LADY HAS
A WORD WITH YOU, HUH?

12:02.534 --> 12:03.400
KARA.

12:03.501 --> 12:05.167
WHERE'S SHE BEEN
CRASHING LATELY?

12:05.267 --> 12:06.734
HOW SHOULD I KNOW?

12:06.834 --> 12:08.467
I DON'T DO HOUSE CALLS.

12:08.567 --> 12:09.667
AGH!

12:09.767 --> 12:12.133
ALL RIGHT!
ALL RIGHT!

12:14.667 --> 12:16.367
SOMETHING SPOOKED HER.

12:16.467 --> 12:17.868
LAST I HEARD,
SHE WAS ON THE MOVE,

12:17.968 --> 12:19.133
LIVING OUT OF HER VAN.

12:19.234 --> 12:20.501
THAT'S IT.

12:20.601 --> 12:21.934
AGH!

12:22.033 --> 12:23.033
AGH!

12:23.133 --> 12:25.467
HANG UP!

12:25.567 --> 12:29.033
SHE'S HANGING OUT AT A
BAR ON JURGEN STREET.

12:29.133 --> 12:30.567
THE RED SKY, HUH?

12:30.667 --> 12:33.067
LOOK, THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

12:38.167 --> 12:42.067
AH, WELL, I GOTTA ADMIT,
YOU GOT SOME NICE MOVES.

12:42.167 --> 12:43.868
YOU SHOULD SEE ME DANCE.

12:43.968 --> 12:46.734
ALTHOUGH USING PSIONICS TO WIN
THE FIGHT... THAT'S CHEATING.

12:46.834 --> 12:50.434
THIS, FROM THE
HUMAN CATTLE PROD?

13:03.133 --> 13:08.634
WHERE IS KARA?

13:13.067 --> 13:16.968
OH... OH... OH...

13:19.567 --> 13:20.701
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?

13:20.801 --> 13:21.667
I DON'T KNOW.

13:23.634 --> 13:25.834
DEMENTIA?

13:26.901 --> 13:28.334
OOH, NO... DRUGS.

13:28.434 --> 13:29.767
HE'S GOT ENOUGH CC'S
OF THORAZINE IN HIM

13:29.868 --> 13:32.067
TO KNOCK OUT A COW.

13:32.167 --> 13:35.300
REALLY, REALLY FAT COW.

13:35.400 --> 13:37.467
SHH! LISTEN!

13:37.567 --> 13:38.734
WHAT'S HE SAYING?

13:38.834 --> 13:40.667
<whispering>

13:40.767 --> 13:44.267
HE'S SO TRANQUED OUT, I
DOUBT HE KNOWS HIS OWN NAME.

13:46.434 --> 13:48.667
SHALIMAR...

13:49.634 --> 13:51.567
HEY!

13:51.667 --> 13:55.200
HUH, I TOLD YOU
YOU'D COME BACK.

13:58.534 --> 14:01.367
WE'VE NEVER MET.

14:02.934 --> 14:05.901
WE'RE STILL BACK THERE?

14:06.000 --> 14:08.901
AT THE BEGINNING?

14:10.334 --> 14:13.534
<wheezing>

14:13.634 --> 14:16.367
ALL MOVING
SO SLOWLY...

14:16.467 --> 14:19.934
<wheezing>

14:20.033 --> 14:22.734
OKAY, THAT WAS
REALLY, REALLY CREEPY.

14:22.834 --> 14:25.734
<inaudible noises>

14:25.834 --> 14:27.567
LEXA?

14:27.667 --> 14:30.234
I WANT YOU TO RECORD
AUDIO OVER MY COMLINK.

14:30.334 --> 14:31.467
<i>OKAY. I'M ON IT.</i>

14:31.567 --> 14:40.901
<inaudible noises>

14:47.334 --> 14:50.801
SAVE IT.
SHE'S NOT INTERESTED.

14:50.901 --> 14:52.267
ACTUALLY?

14:52.367 --> 14:53.868
NONE OF THEM ARE.

14:53.968 --> 14:57.133
I FEEL A COMPLETE LACK OF
ATTRACTION TO YOU IN HERE.

14:57.234 --> 14:58.901
HUH, PLEASE.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.767
IF YOU WERE ANY HOTTER
FOR ME, I'D GET A SUNTAN.

15:01.868 --> 15:04.467
<laughter>

15:04.567 --> 15:06.767
AH, SO,
DRINKING ON THE JOB.

15:06.868 --> 15:11.701
FIRST RULE OF HUNTING: BLEND
IN WITH YOUR SURROUNDINGS.

15:11.801 --> 15:14.067
YOU GOTTA MAKE YOURSELF
COMFORTABLE, TOO.

15:14.167 --> 15:17.467
<laughter>
NICE...

15:17.567 --> 15:18.767
THAT OKAY?

15:18.868 --> 15:19.901
THAT'S FINE.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.100
YEAH, I CAN HANDLE THAT.

15:21.200 --> 15:22.167
GOOD.

15:22.267 --> 15:23.300
CHEERS.

15:23.400 --> 15:26.033
CHEERS.

15:29.267 --> 15:31.200
SO HOW'D YOU GET INTO
THIS LINE OF WORK?

15:31.300 --> 15:32.267
LET'S SEE...

15:32.367 --> 15:35.300
MAKE MY OWN RULES,
KICK SOME BAD GUY ASS...

15:35.400 --> 15:37.234
WHAT COULD BE
BETTER THAN THAT?

15:37.334 --> 15:39.968
PLUS, IT'S THE PERFECT
GIG FOR A PSIONIC.

15:40.067 --> 15:42.567
WELL, I GUESS THAT EXPLAINS
WHY YOU'RE SO COCKY.

15:42.667 --> 15:46.334
WELL, KNOWING WHEN SOMEBODY'S
GOING TO BE ABLE TO LIE TO YOU.

15:47.367 --> 15:49.234
SOMEONE
ACTUALLY DID...

15:49.334 --> 15:50.834
ONCE.

15:50.934 --> 15:52.601
AND?

15:52.701 --> 15:55.033
I'LL NEVER LET ANYONE
GET THAT CLOSE AGAIN.

15:55.133 --> 15:56.901
WELL, YOU CAN'T GO THROUGH
LIFE LIVING LIKE THAT.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.067
MAYBE.

15:58.167 --> 16:00.767
BUT I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE
WITH TRUST ISSUES HERE.

16:00.868 --> 16:01.834
HUH.

16:01.934 --> 16:04.067
I CAN FEEL YOU HAVE
YOUR DOUBTS ABOUT ME.

16:04.167 --> 16:05.567
YEAH, WELL, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO BE A PSIONIC

16:05.667 --> 16:07.133
TO BE A GOOD
JUDGE OF CHARACTER.

16:07.234 --> 16:08.033
REALLY?

16:08.133 --> 16:09.133
YEAH.

16:09.234 --> 16:11.334
SO, WHAT ARE YOU...

16:11.434 --> 16:14.868
PICKING UP ON ME?

16:24.200 --> 16:27.367
OKAY...

16:27.467 --> 16:29.334
WHAT AM I PICKING
UP ON YOU?

16:29.434 --> 16:30.834
WELL, THAT YOU'VE GOT
SOMETHING TO HIDE AND THAT

16:30.934 --> 16:33.868
YOU'RE AFRAID THAT I'M GOING
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS.

16:33.968 --> 16:38.300
AND JUST FOR
THE RECORD, I WILL.

16:40.968 --> 16:42.234
ANYTHING?

16:42.334 --> 16:44.601
SO FAR, JUST THIS.

16:44.701 --> 16:49.167
<inaudible sound>

16:49.267 --> 16:51.300
DO WE EVEN KNOW
IF THIS IS ENGLISH?

16:51.400 --> 16:52.567
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

16:52.667 --> 16:54.267
SCOOTCH.

16:54.367 --> 16:55.601
I'M PUTTING IT THROUGH
A CONVERSION PROGRAM,

16:55.701 --> 16:59.000
RUN IT THROUGH THE
LANGUAGE PROCESSOR.

17:02.501 --> 17:03.501
THIS COULD TAKE A WHILE.

17:03.601 --> 17:05.300
WAIT...
THIS GUY'S A PRECOG.

17:05.400 --> 17:06.467
UNSTUCK IN TIME.

17:06.567 --> 17:09.233
FORWARD, BACKWARD.
THEY'RE THE SAME TO HIM.

17:09.334 --> 17:11.534
TRY RUNNING IT IN REVERSE.

17:15.434 --> 17:19.133
<i>FROM THE BLOOD OF FOUR,
WILL COME OUR SON</i>

17:19.233 --> 17:21.601
<i>ONCE ALL SIGNS PASS,</i>

17:21.701 --> 17:23.367
<i>IF THE LINKS REMAIN</i>

17:23.467 --> 17:27.300
<i>THE HEART OF ASHLOCKE
WILL LIVE AGAIN.</i>

18:03.467 --> 18:04.467
I'M TELLING YOU,

18:04.567 --> 18:06.033
THERE IS SOMETHING
GOING ON BETWEEN THEM.

18:06.133 --> 18:07.501
BETWEEN BRENNAN
AND SHALIMAR?

18:07.601 --> 18:08.601
ARE YOU MENTAL?

18:08.701 --> 18:09.801
THEY'VE ALWAYS
BEEN LIKE THAT.

18:09.901 --> 18:11.801
PLEASE, SHE HAS NO
PERSPECTIVE WITH HIM.

18:11.901 --> 18:14.000
EVERY IMPULSE
IS ON A TEN.

18:14.100 --> 18:14.901
SHE'S A FERAL.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.501
SHE'S JUST MARKING
HER TERRITORY.

18:16.601 --> 18:17.767
OH, MY GOD!

18:17.868 --> 18:19.000
SHE GETS ANY MORE
TERRITORIAL WITH BRENNAN,

18:19.100 --> 18:21.067
SHE'LL HAVE TO
PEE ON HIS LEG.

18:22.133 --> 18:23.334
LET'S PRETEND
I NEVER SAID THAT.

18:23.434 --> 18:25.234
YEAH. ALREADY TRYING.

18:34.634 --> 18:35.601
STILL, THOUGH,
YOU GOTTA ADMIT,

18:35.701 --> 18:36.934
THAT HAVING
A RELATIONSHIP

18:37.033 --> 18:39.334
WITH SOMEBODY YOU WORK AND
LIVE WITH, COULD BE TOUGH.

18:39.434 --> 18:41.000
WHY?

18:41.100 --> 18:42.100
WELL, IT'S RISKY.

18:42.200 --> 18:44.100
I MEAN, WHAT IF YOU'RE
MISINTERPRETING THEM?

18:44.200 --> 18:46.200
WHAT IF THEY'RE JUST
PRETENDING TO LIKE YOU

18:46.300 --> 18:47.834
BECAUSE THEY GET OFF ON
THE WHOLE POWER TRIP,

18:47.934 --> 18:49.100
WHILE THE WHOLE TIME

18:49.200 --> 18:50.367
THEY'RE JUST WAITING TO
PULL THE RUG FROM UNDER YOU,

18:50.467 --> 18:52.567
SO YOU FALL FLAT ON YOUR ASS,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

18:52.667 --> 18:54.033
HYPOTHETICALLY
SPEAKING.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.834
WELL, THERE'S ONLY EVER
ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.

18:57.834 --> 19:00.200
SOMEBODY'S GOT TO
MAKE THE FIRST MOVE...

19:00.300 --> 19:03.701
...HYPOTHETICALLY
SPEAKING.

19:03.801 --> 19:05.234
THE MEEK SHALL INHERIT
THE EARTH, JESSE,

19:05.334 --> 19:09.167
BUT THEY NEVER
GET THE GIRL.

19:09.267 --> 19:12.100
WHO ARE YOU
CALLING MEEK?

19:12.200 --> 19:14.534
<computer beep>

19:14.634 --> 19:16.767
TALK ABOUT
GETTING THE GIRL...

19:16.868 --> 19:17.868
ALL RIGHT.

19:17.968 --> 19:21.133
WOULD THE REAL RILEY
MORGAN PLEASE STAND UP.

19:21.234 --> 19:22.067
OKAY...

19:22.167 --> 19:24.000
MORGAN, COMMA, RILEY.

19:24.100 --> 19:27.400
BORN ISABELLA
EASTHAM 27 YEARS AGO.

19:27.501 --> 19:30.834
AND WHAT HAS SHE BEEN
UP TO IN THE MEANTIME?

19:30.934 --> 19:34.033
BECOMING A CARD-CARRYING
MEMBER OF ASHLOCKE'S CULT.

19:34.133 --> 19:36.000
OH, MY GOD.
RILEY'S A LINK.

19:36.100 --> 19:37.167
YEAH.

19:37.267 --> 19:38.267
THIS IS NO COINCIDENCE.

19:38.367 --> 19:39.400
WE HAVE TO TELL BRENNAN.

19:39.501 --> 19:40.534
SHALIMAR SAID NOT TO.

19:40.634 --> 19:43.334
HUH, AND SHE'S JUST
BEEN OVERRULED.

19:43.434 --> 19:48.400
<laughter>

19:48.501 --> 19:51.000
I WANT THE TRUTH.
ALL OF IT.

19:52.267 --> 19:54.400
PEOPLE DON'T WANT
THE TRUTH FROM ME.

19:54.501 --> 19:56.934
THEY WANT FAIRY TALES.

19:57.033 --> 19:59.267
HAPPY ENDINGS.

19:59.367 --> 20:00.834
JUST TELL ME ABOUT THE PROPHECY.

20:00.934 --> 20:03.234
OH, YOU MEAN THE CHILD.

20:03.334 --> 20:05.267
WHAT CHILD?

20:05.367 --> 20:06.834
SON OF FOUR BLOODS,

20:06.934 --> 20:10.634
COME TO RAISE THE
LINKS ABOVE ALL OTHERS.

20:10.734 --> 20:15.200
ASHLOCKE DIED BEFORE HE
COULD FULFIL HIS PROMISE.

20:15.300 --> 20:21.601
WITH THIS CHILD, THE LINKS
WILL SHAPE A NEW WORLD.

20:21.701 --> 20:24.467
HOW CAN WE STOP IT?

20:24.567 --> 20:26.567
AHH!

20:26.667 --> 20:28.334
IF IT'S MEANT TO BE
STOPPED, IT WILL BE.

20:28.434 --> 20:32.167
IF IT'S NOT, IT WON'T.

20:32.267 --> 20:34.901
TIME WILL TELL...

20:35.000 --> 20:37.901
I WANT SPECIFICS.

20:40.534 --> 20:45.133
<i>A CHILD WILL BE BORN,
BUT FOR OUR HOLD TO LAST,</i>

20:45.234 --> 20:48.868
<i>ALL FOUR SIGNS
MUST COME TO PASS.</i>

20:48.968 --> 20:52.634
<i>A MOON WILL FALL, TWO
BLOODS WILL BE DASHED,</i>

20:52.734 --> 20:56.868
<i>THE CHILD WILL CHOOSE
AND THE MOUNTAIN...</i>

20:56.968 --> 20:59.901
<i>WILL CRASH...</i>

21:00.000 --> 21:02.133
<i>SMASHING...</i>

21:02.234 --> 21:05.267
<i>SO IT SHALL PASS...</i>

21:09.868 --> 21:12.501
YOU'RE CRAZY.

21:14.300 --> 21:16.534
THEN I'M IN THE
RIGHT PLACE.

21:19.801 --> 21:21.567
WHAT DOES THIS CHILD
HAVE TO DO WITH BRENNAN?

21:21.667 --> 21:25.334
<laughter>

21:25.434 --> 21:26.801
HAVEN'T YOU GUESSED YET?

21:26.901 --> 21:33.601
<laughter>

21:33.701 --> 21:36.133
ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT
IF KARA DOESN'T SHOW?

21:36.234 --> 21:38.033
DAMN, YOU'RE IMPATIENT.

21:38.133 --> 21:40.567
ARE YOU IN THIS MUCH OF
A HURRY FOR EVERYTHING?

21:40.667 --> 21:41.934
NOT EVERYTHING.

21:42.033 --> 21:43.200
REALLY?

21:43.300 --> 21:44.267
WELL, LET ME SEE.

21:44.367 --> 21:45.501
HEY... NO.

21:45.601 --> 21:46.667
STAY OUT OF MY HEAD.

21:46.767 --> 21:50.133
<laughter>
PLEASE, I'D DIE OF
BOREDOM IN THERE.

21:50.234 --> 21:51.100
IS THAT SO?

21:51.200 --> 21:52.734
OH, SO THAT'S HOW IT IS.

21:52.834 --> 21:54.167
FINE, FINE.

21:54.267 --> 21:55.267
OKAY...

21:55.367 --> 21:57.901
OKAY, MAYBE I TOOK IT TOO FAR.

21:58.033 --> 21:59.467
FORGIVE ME.

21:59.567 --> 22:01.100
MAYBE, IF...

22:01.200 --> 22:05.701
YOU ASK ME REALLY,
REALLY, REALLY NICELY?

22:05.801 --> 22:08.300
AHEM...

22:11.601 --> 22:13.300
PRETTY PLEASE?

22:13.400 --> 22:15.834
NICER.

22:20.634 --> 22:22.234
WITH ME ON TOP?

22:22.334 --> 22:24.100
OH, COME ON,
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

22:24.200 --> 22:25.534
YOU'RE PLAYING DIRTY.

22:25.634 --> 22:27.334
WHO SAYS I'M PLAYING?

22:27.434 --> 22:29.667
<i>Jesse:
BRENNAN, YOU THERE?</i>

22:29.767 --> 22:31.801
UM...

22:31.901 --> 22:33.400
YOU KNOW, WHEN...

22:33.501 --> 22:39.667
WHEN THIS IS ALL OVER, I
THINK YOU AND I SHOULD, UH...

22:39.767 --> 22:41.501
YOU AND I SHOULD...

22:41.601 --> 22:42.701
WHAT?

22:42.801 --> 22:45.167
WELL, YOU'RE THE PSIONIC.

22:45.267 --> 22:49.067
WHY DON'T YOU READ MY MIND?

22:55.100 --> 22:57.334
<laughter>

22:57.434 --> 23:02.501
WHY DON'T YOU GET US ANOTHER
BEER, AND MAYBE SOME ICE?

23:04.667 --> 23:06.968
DAMMIT, JESS, WHAT'S
GOING ON? I'M WORKING HERE, MAN.

23:07.067 --> 23:09.767
ACTUALLY, WE THINK
YOU'RE BEING WORKED.

23:09.868 --> 23:11.033
WHY? WHAT'S GOING ON?

23:11.133 --> 23:13.501
OH, JUST YOUR BASIC
ATTEMPT AT NEW WORLD ORDER.

23:13.601 --> 23:15.200
LOOK, WE DON'T KNOW
EVERYTHING YET.

23:15.300 --> 23:16.667
SHAL'S GETTING US
MORE AS WE SPEAK.

23:16.767 --> 23:18.300
BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW,
IS THAT THIS PROPHECY

23:18.400 --> 23:19.968
THAT SUPPOSEDLY
INVOLVES YOU,

23:20.067 --> 23:21.400
WAS BEGUN
BY THE LINKS

23:21.501 --> 23:23.234
AND MISS RILEY
IS ONE OF THEM.

23:23.334 --> 23:24.467
YOU SURE?

23:24.567 --> 23:26.501
<i>GOT THE PROOF RIGHT
IN FRONT OF ME, MAN.</i>

23:26.601 --> 23:28.000
LOOK, JUST...

23:28.100 --> 23:29.934
WATCH YOUR BACK UNTIL WE KNOW
WHAT GAME SHE'S PLAYING,

23:30.033 --> 23:30.834
ALL RIGHT?

23:30.934 --> 23:32.000
YEAH, YEAH...

23:32.100 --> 23:34.367
JUST KEEP ME POSTED, HUH?

23:36.434 --> 23:39.334
GUESS WE NEED TO TALK.

23:39.434 --> 23:42.000
HUH...

23:43.067 --> 23:45.200
KARA!

23:51.133 --> 23:53.033
DON'T DO THIS, KARA, I
DON'T WANT TO HURT YOU.

23:53.133 --> 23:54.167
LIAR!

23:54.267 --> 23:56.100
YOU'VE ALREADY HURT ME.

23:56.200 --> 23:57.467
WE'RE HERE TO HELP YOU.

23:57.567 --> 23:58.334
YOU'RE IN DANGER.

23:58.434 --> 23:59.534
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

23:59.634 --> 24:01.634
AND I KNOW WHAT
YOU'VE TAKEN FROM ME.

24:01.734 --> 24:03.934
AND I KNOW WHAT YOU WANT.

24:04.033 --> 24:06.267
OHHH...

24:06.367 --> 24:09.367
<screams>

24:22.501 --> 24:24.033
STOP!

24:25.868 --> 24:27.067
YOU CAN'T KILL HIM YET.

24:27.167 --> 24:28.934
HE'S OUR ONLY PATH TO THE CHILD.

24:29.033 --> 24:29.767
WHAT CHILD?

24:29.868 --> 24:31.300
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

24:31.400 --> 24:33.033
KARA!

24:41.634 --> 24:43.968
SHE'S DEAD.

25:05.334 --> 25:07.534
THIS CHILD?

25:09.000 --> 25:10.567
WHO IS HE?

25:10.667 --> 25:17.200
ACCORDING TO THE PROPHECY,
HE'S ASHLOCKE'S SECOND COMING.

25:19.868 --> 25:23.000
ACCORDING TO BIOLOGY...

25:23.100 --> 25:25.400
...HE'S OUR SON.

25:32.801 --> 25:34.367
NOT JUST OURS.

25:34.467 --> 25:36.834
I MEAN, OUR DNA
HELPED CREATE HIM.

25:36.934 --> 25:37.901
WHAT?

25:38.000 --> 25:40.501
BUT, KARA, NATHAN, YOURS, MINE

25:40.601 --> 25:42.667
- ONE FROM EACH MUTANT TYPE.

25:42.767 --> 25:44.734
OKAY, BUT HOW'D
THEY GET MY DNA?

25:44.834 --> 25:47.534
WELL, I'M SURE YOU'VE BEEN
LEAVING IT ALL OVER TOWN.

25:51.534 --> 25:53.868
MOST OF THE LINKS
WERE GENOMEXERS,

25:53.968 --> 25:56.701
IT COULDN'T HAVE
BEEN ALL THAT HARD.

25:56.801 --> 25:59.133
SO YOU'VE BEEN AFTER THIS
KID FROM THE BEGINNING?

25:59.234 --> 26:01.367
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST TELL
ME THAT FROM THE START?

26:01.467 --> 26:02.434
WHEN WE MET IN THE ALLEY?

26:02.534 --> 26:05.667
I KNOW. I KNOW.

26:05.767 --> 26:07.968
REMEMBER THE GUY I SAID
I WISH I HADN'T TRUSTED?

26:08.067 --> 26:09.667
OH, OH, WAIT...
DON'T TELL ME.

26:09.767 --> 26:10.901
LET ME GUESS.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.133
GABRIEL ASHLOCKE.

26:17.901 --> 26:20.434
YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER
HAVING THIS FEELING,

26:20.534 --> 26:22.634
EVER SINCE I WAS
A REAL YOUNG KID

26:22.734 --> 26:26.267
THAT I WAS MEANT TO DO
SOMETHING WITH MY LIFE,

26:26.367 --> 26:29.133
SOMETHING THAT MATTERED.

26:29.234 --> 26:32.868
AND FOR A WHILE, I THOUGHT
THAT WAS PROTECTING ASHLOCKE.

26:32.968 --> 26:35.167
YOU FELL FOR THE WHOLE "I'M
THE MUTANT SAVIOUR" CRAP?

26:38.767 --> 26:43.968
WHEN HE DIED, I MEAN,
I STAYED WITH THE LINKS.

26:44.067 --> 26:46.000
WHEN BISHOP SPOKE HIS PROPHECY,

26:46.100 --> 26:53.834
AND NAMED ME ONE OF THE CHOSEN
FOUR, I ACTUALLY FELT BLESSED.

26:53.934 --> 26:57.334
BUT IF BISHOP'S CORRECT, THE
LINKS WILL WARP THAT CHILD

26:57.434 --> 27:01.367
AND MAKE HIM DARKER, DEADLIER
THAN ANY MUTANT WE'VE SEEN,

27:01.467 --> 27:03.167
INCLUDING ASHLOCKE.

27:03.267 --> 27:05.734
WELL, THERE'S GOTTA BE SOME
WAY THAT WE CAN STOP THEM.

27:05.834 --> 27:06.868
THERE ARE FOUR SIGNS

27:06.968 --> 27:09.767
THAT HERALD THE
TRANSFORMATION
OF THE CHILD.

27:09.868 --> 27:11.300
THE MOON WILL FALL.

27:11.400 --> 27:13.000
TWO BLOODS WILL BE DASHED.

27:13.100 --> 27:14.901
THE CHILD WILL CHOOSE...

27:15.000 --> 27:16.901
...AND THE MOUNTAIN WILL CRASH.

27:17.000 --> 27:21.234
IF WE CAN STOP THE SIGN,
WE STOP THE PROPHECY.

27:21.334 --> 27:25.267
NOW, THE MOON FALLING,
THAT WAS THE ECLIPSE.

27:25.367 --> 27:27.267
TWO BLOODS WILL BE DASHED...

27:27.367 --> 27:28.534
WAIT, THAT...

27:28.634 --> 27:30.234
THAT'S NATHAN AND KARA.

27:30.334 --> 27:31.300
SO WE MISSED TWO SIGNS.

27:31.400 --> 27:34.767
THAT'S MEANS THERE'S
ONLY TWO LEFT.

27:38.534 --> 27:42.634
I KNEW YOU WOULD COME.

27:42.734 --> 27:44.934
I KNEW IT.

27:45.033 --> 27:47.501
BEFORE YOU WERE EVEN BORN.

27:48.801 --> 27:50.934
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

27:54.167 --> 27:55.934
ARE WE IN THE PRESENT?

27:56.033 --> 27:59.167
YEAH.

27:59.267 --> 28:02.667
I NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE LAST
TWO SIGNS MEAN, BISHOP.

28:02.767 --> 28:03.634
THE MOUNTAIN WILL CRASH.

28:03.734 --> 28:05.133
WHAT IS THE MOUNTAIN?

28:05.234 --> 28:08.367
THE CHILD'S HOME AND FORTRESS.

28:08.467 --> 28:11.734
HIS CASTLE UNDERGROUND.

28:11.834 --> 28:13.133
THE LAST OF THE LINKS

28:13.234 --> 28:15.534
HAVE SPENT THESE TWO
YEARS SINCE HIS BIRTH

28:15.634 --> 28:17.634
READYING IT FOR HIM.

28:17.734 --> 28:19.701
WHILE THE GUARDIAN
WATCHED OVER HIM.

28:19.801 --> 28:21.868
THE TIME IS READY FOR
THE CHILD TO DESCEND NOW,

28:21.968 --> 28:26.501
TO RULE WHERE NO
ILL HAND CAN REACH HIM.

28:26.601 --> 28:28.367
WHERE IS HE?

28:28.467 --> 28:31.067
YOU WERE RAILING AGAINST THAT
WHICH CANNOT BE STOPPED.

28:31.167 --> 28:33.200
IF IT CAN'T BE STOPPED, THEN
THERE'S NO DANGER IN TELLING.

28:33.300 --> 28:35.434
<crying>

28:35.534 --> 28:38.400
UNLESS YOU AREN'T AS SURE OF
YOUR PREDICTIONS AS YOU PRETEND?

28:38.501 --> 28:42.400
<heavy breathing>

28:42.501 --> 28:44.701
YOU TRY HOLDING IT
ALL INSIDE YOUR HEAD, GIRL.

28:44.801 --> 28:46.467
ALL THE POSSIBLE FUTURES
AND ALL THE WORLD

28:46.567 --> 28:49.400
GETTING A FRESH GLIMPSE
WITH EVERY HAND YOU TOUCH.

28:49.501 --> 28:52.801
SEE HOW EASY IT IS FOR YOU
TO SEE THE ONE TRUE WAY.

29:00.200 --> 29:03.501
I'LL PROVE I'M RIGHT.

29:03.601 --> 29:06.434
TELL THE LAST OF THE BLOODS
THEY CAN FIND THE GUARDIAN

29:06.534 --> 29:11.667
WHERE TRACKS MEET
WATERS UNDER DESTINY.

29:13.767 --> 29:16.167
BUT IT'LL DO THEM NO GOOD.

29:16.267 --> 29:18.234
SO I HAVE SEEN.

29:18.334 --> 29:20.701
SO IT SHALL BE.

29:28.167 --> 29:30.601
SHALIMAR?

29:34.267 --> 29:37.701
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
HOW YOU WILL DIE?

29:37.801 --> 29:39.734
I PREFER THE SUSPENSE, THANKS.

29:39.834 --> 29:43.300
AND WHAT OF BRENNAN?

29:43.400 --> 29:46.868
WOULD YOU NOT LIKE TO
KNOW HOW IT ENDS FOR HIM?

29:46.968 --> 29:52.868
IF THERE'S A CHANCE YOU
COULD SAVE HIM FROM IT?

29:52.968 --> 29:55.567
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ANOTHER WORD FROM YOU.

29:55.667 --> 29:58.834
YOU WILL.

29:58.934 --> 30:00.334
YOU WILL!

30:00.434 --> 30:06.734
YOU WILL! YOU WILL!
YOU WILL! YOU WILL!

30:10.567 --> 30:12.767
YOU WILL.

30:12.868 --> 30:13.801
<i>BRENNAN?</i>

30:13.901 --> 30:15.133
YEAH, MAN?

30:15.234 --> 30:17.767
WELL, SHALIMAR JUST GOT
THE LAST CLUE FROM BISHOP.

30:17.868 --> 30:19.133
HE SAID THAT YOU'LL
FIND THE GUARDIAN

30:19.234 --> 30:22.033
WHERE THE TRACKS MEET
THE WATER UNDER DESTINY.

30:22.133 --> 30:23.534
SOUNDS LIKE A
FORTUNE COOKIE.

30:23.634 --> 30:26.400
<i>YEAH, WELL, EXCEPT THAT
THERE'S AN OLD RAILWAY LINE</i>

30:26.501 --> 30:27.701
<i>THAT ENDS AT THE DOCKS,</i>

30:27.801 --> 30:30.734
AND THERE'S A BOAT
IN PIER 17 NAMED DESTINY.

30:30.834 --> 30:32.234
<i>WE FIGURE THAT'S WHERE THE
GUARDIAN'S KEEPING THE KID</i>

30:32.334 --> 30:33.567
<i>UNTIL IT'S TIME TO MOVE IT.</i>

30:33.667 --> 30:36.234
YEAH. AND WHICH, ACCORDING
TO BISHOP, IS RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

30:36.334 --> 30:38.501
WE'RE ON IT.

30:38.601 --> 30:40.701
I'LL TELL YOU, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THOSE LINKHEADS WERE THINKING.

30:40.801 --> 30:42.734
TWO MUTANTS HAVING
KIDS IS STUPID ENOUGH,

30:42.834 --> 30:43.934
BUT MIXING FOUR...

30:44.033 --> 30:46.000
WHOA, BACK THAT UP.
JUST BACK THAT UP.

30:46.100 --> 30:48.367
TWO MUTANTS HAVING
KIDS IS STUPID?

30:48.467 --> 30:49.634
SINCE WHEN?

30:49.734 --> 30:50.934
SINCE EIGHTY
PERCENT OF THE TIME

30:51.033 --> 30:52.601
THEY'RE BIOLOGICAL
DISASTERS.

30:52.701 --> 30:54.067
WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER TWENTY?

30:54.167 --> 30:55.300
SELFISH IMPULSE.

30:55.400 --> 30:56.400
I'M SORRY, BUT THE
LAST TIME I CHECKED,

30:56.501 --> 30:58.367
PROCREATION IS A
BASIC HUMAN RIGHT.

30:58.467 --> 30:59.634
HMM, AND THE LAST
TIME I CHECKED,

30:59.734 --> 31:02.634
WE WEREN'T BASIC HUMANS.

31:02.734 --> 31:04.601
OH, STOP LOOKING AT ME LIKE
I JUST KILLED YOUR PUPPY.

31:04.701 --> 31:06.501
YOU KNOW I'M RIGHT.

31:06.601 --> 31:08.033
JESS, OUR VERY
EXISTENCE IS SCREWING

31:08.133 --> 31:10.367
WITH THE NATURAL
ORDER OF THINGS.

31:10.467 --> 31:12.100
THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE
IT RIGHT AGAIN IS...

31:12.200 --> 31:13.934
IS TO LET US MUTANTS DIE OUT.

31:14.033 --> 31:16.167
THAT'S IT.

31:18.801 --> 31:20.734
AW, I WISH YOU WOULD HAVE LET
ME WHACK THAT GUARDIAN THING

31:20.834 --> 31:21.934
WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE.

31:22.033 --> 31:23.734
DON'T BE SO SURE
YOU COULD HAVE.

31:23.834 --> 31:25.734
SOMETIMES I THINK
HE'S INDESTRUCTIBLE.

31:25.834 --> 31:27.968
WELL, I LOOK FORWARD
TO PROVING YOU WRONG.

31:29.133 --> 31:31.634
DESTINY.

31:31.734 --> 31:32.868
BRENNAN!

31:32.968 --> 31:35.434
AGH...

31:35.534 --> 31:38.734
AGH...! AGH!

31:38.834 --> 31:42.300
AGH...! OH...

31:42.400 --> 31:46.000
UGH...

31:56.434 --> 31:58.501
HE DISAPPEARED.

31:58.601 --> 32:00.067
HE CHOSE...

32:00.167 --> 32:01.434
WHAT?

32:01.534 --> 32:04.300
THE CHILD WILL CHOOSE.

32:04.400 --> 32:08.767
HE CHOSE TO PROTECT
THE GUARDIAN.

32:08.868 --> 32:11.667
WE JUST WATCHED
THE THIRD SIGN.

32:14.868 --> 32:17.167
CLOSE TO WHERE BRENNAN AND
RILEY LAST SAW THE GUARDIAN.

32:17.267 --> 32:18.667
DO YOU WANT TO COME
AND TAKE A LOOK?

32:18.767 --> 32:21.033
YOU'RE ASHAMED
OF YOUR MUTATION.

32:21.133 --> 32:22.834
OH, MY GOD. WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

32:22.934 --> 32:24.601
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT I
NEVER NOTICED IT BEFORE.

32:24.701 --> 32:30.100
BUT ADMIT IT... DEEP DOWN
YOU'RE A SELF-LOATHING MUTANT.

32:30.200 --> 32:31.300
DO YOU HEAR HOW STUPID
YOU'RE SOUNDING RIGHT NOW,

32:31.400 --> 32:32.567
OR IS IT JUST ME?

32:32.667 --> 32:34.234
...I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT
EXACTLY THE POSTER CHILD

32:34.334 --> 32:35.334
FOR THE PICTURE PERFECT FAMILY,

32:35.434 --> 32:36.601
SO WHY WOULD
IT SURPRISE ME

32:36.701 --> 32:38.000
THAT YOU'RE AN
ANTl-BREEDER?

32:38.100 --> 32:39.567
OKAY. WELL, I'M ALSO RIGHT.

32:39.667 --> 32:41.701
TELL ME, JESS, HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE WE HAD TO STEP IN

32:41.801 --> 32:43.734
TO AVERT MUTANT-CAUSED
DISASTERS,

32:43.834 --> 32:45.567
JUST WITH THE FEW
OF US THAT EXIST SO FAR?

32:45.667 --> 32:46.734
THAT IS SUCH
A CHEAP ARGUMENT.

32:46.834 --> 32:47.701
NO, IT'S NOT.

32:47.801 --> 32:48.734
OH, COME ON.

32:48.834 --> 32:49.634
LIKE, THERE'S NOT
CRIMINALS OUT THERE

32:49.734 --> 32:50.968
IN THE NORMAL
SOCIETY AS WELL.

32:51.067 --> 32:55.133
NONE THAT ARE THEIR OWN
PERSONAL BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS, NO.

32:55.234 --> 32:56.067
OH...

32:56.167 --> 32:58.467
IT'S EVOLUTION, JESS.

32:58.567 --> 33:00.033
SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST.

33:00.133 --> 33:02.033
THAT'S US.

33:02.133 --> 33:03.934
WE'LL LIVE AND WE'LL
THRIVE, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

33:04.033 --> 33:05.133
THE REST OF HUMANITY
IS GOING TO DIE,

33:05.234 --> 33:07.267
AND THAT'S NOT
SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.

33:07.367 --> 33:08.467
WHAT IF IT IS?

33:08.567 --> 33:09.567
WHAT?

33:09.667 --> 33:11.968
WHAT IF THERE ARE
NO COSMIC ACCIDENTS?

33:12.067 --> 33:14.634
WHAT IF ADAM WAS
SUPPOSED TO CREATE US?

33:14.734 --> 33:18.100
AND WE'RE THE BEGINNING
OF... I DON'T KNOW...

33:18.200 --> 33:21.734
THE BEGINNING OF A
NEW PHASE OF HUMANITY?

33:21.834 --> 33:23.834
WHATEVER HELPS YOU SLEEP.

33:23.934 --> 33:25.267
I GUESS WE'RE JUST GOING TO
HAVE TO AGREE TO DISAGREE,

33:25.367 --> 33:26.501
THAT'S ALL.

33:26.601 --> 33:27.734
FINE.

33:27.834 --> 33:30.067
FINE.

33:33.901 --> 33:35.067
LEXA, PLEASE.

33:35.167 --> 33:36.534
LOOK, ALL I'M SAYING,

33:36.634 --> 33:39.567
IS IF THERE WAS A
HUNDRED LITTLE BABY LEXAS

33:39.667 --> 33:40.934
RUNNING AROUND
OUT THERE IN THE WORLD

33:41.033 --> 33:42.334
THAT WERE ALL GOING TO GROW
UP TO BE JUST LIKE YOU,

33:42.434 --> 33:45.167
I HAPPEN TO THINK THE
WORLD WOULD BE A BETTER PLACE.

33:47.300 --> 33:49.667
YEP.

33:49.767 --> 33:52.534
A FRUSTRATING, PIGHEADED...

33:52.634 --> 33:54.734
BEAUTIFUL PLACE.

33:57.501 --> 33:59.334
WHAT?

33:59.434 --> 34:05.934
SOMETIMES, YOU
KNOW, FOR A MORON...

34:06.033 --> 34:09.967
YOU SAY EXACTLY
THE RIGHT THINGS.

34:10.067 --> 34:13.100
NOW COME HELP ME
FIND MY MOUNTAIN.

34:19.467 --> 34:20.766
LET'S TAKE A TIGHTER LOOK.

34:22.199 --> 34:23.801
NOPE.

34:23.900 --> 34:26.132
UH UH.

34:26.234 --> 34:28.300
OH...

34:28.400 --> 34:31.000
DADDY LIKES.

34:31.100 --> 34:33.734
OKAY, KIDS, I THINK WE
GOT OUR LAST DESTINATION.

34:33.833 --> 34:36.199
IT'S A GROUPING OF CAVES
UNDER THE SEWERS NEAR YOU.

34:36.300 --> 34:37.601
IT'S A...

34:37.701 --> 34:39.601
OLD MINE.

34:40.434 --> 34:41.434
ALL RIGHT.

34:41.534 --> 34:42.667
SO HOW MANY LINKS ARE LEFT?

34:42.766 --> 34:44.534
ONLY A HANDFUL OF
HARD CORE BELIEVERS.

34:44.634 --> 34:48.367
BUT NOTHING'S MORE DANGEROUS
IN THE WRONG HANDS THAN FAITH.

34:48.467 --> 34:49.766
YEAH.

34:49.868 --> 34:51.734
TRUST ME, I DON'T WANT
TO RUN INTO ANY OF THEM.

34:51.833 --> 34:52.900
SHAL, WHERE YOU AT?

34:53.000 --> 34:54.501
IN THE HELIX, NOT FAR FROM YOU.

34:54.601 --> 34:56.000
ALL RIGHT,
I'M HAVING A FEELING

34:56.100 --> 34:57.467
WE'RE GOING TO
BE VERY OUTNUMBERED.

34:57.567 --> 34:59.000
SO YOU GOT MY BACK?

34:59.100 --> 35:01.133
ALWAYS.

35:05.734 --> 35:07.234
SO IT'S HER?

35:07.334 --> 35:08.701
WHO?

35:08.801 --> 35:12.601
THE WOMAN WHOSE FINGERPRINTS
I FEEL ALL OVER YOUR HEART.

35:12.701 --> 35:15.033
HUH, I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

35:15.133 --> 35:17.400
BESIDES, DIDN'T I TELL YOU
TO STAY OUT OF MY HEAD?

35:17.501 --> 35:19.200
OH, THAT WASN'T
PSIONICS, HONEY.

35:19.300 --> 35:21.467
THAT WAS JUST
FEMALE INTUITION.

35:21.567 --> 35:22.734
YEAH, FEMALE INTUITION.

35:22.834 --> 35:26.200
WELL, I HOPE SHE'S NOT IN
AS MUCH DENIAL AS YOU ARE.

35:26.300 --> 35:27.334
HUH... WAIT, WAIT, HOLD UP.

35:27.434 --> 35:28.634
HOLD ON ONE SEC.

35:28.734 --> 35:29.934
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

35:30.033 --> 35:31.100
YEAH.

35:31.200 --> 35:32.501
IF YOU'RE A TELEPATH,

35:32.601 --> 35:34.300
THEN HOW THE HELL DID YOU
GET FOOLED BY ASHLOCKE?

35:34.400 --> 35:36.434
WELL, HE DIDN'T USE
HIS POWERS TO CONVERT ME,

35:36.534 --> 35:38.267
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE ASKING.

35:38.367 --> 35:42.167
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
ALL HE USED WAS HIS CHARM.

35:42.267 --> 35:44.167
FELL IN LOVE WITH THE BASTARD.

35:44.267 --> 35:45.601
IT'S PATHETIC, HUH?

35:45.701 --> 35:47.767
UH, YEAH.

35:47.868 --> 35:49.000
FACE IT,
ONE OF THESE DAYS

35:49.100 --> 35:50.534
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO TRUST SOMEONE, AGAIN.

35:50.634 --> 35:53.067
NO. WHAT I HAVE TO DO IS MAKE
SURE THAT NO MUTANT LIKE THAT

35:53.167 --> 35:57.100
EVER EXISTS AGAIN...
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

35:58.567 --> 36:00.434
OKAY, SO HOW DO YOU
KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING?

36:00.534 --> 36:02.167
BY TRACKING.

36:02.267 --> 36:03.734
CAN'T YOU FEEL HIM?

36:03.834 --> 36:05.934
HUH... THE CHILD?

36:06.033 --> 36:07.934
AND NOT JUST HIM.

36:08.868 --> 36:10.534
YOU'RE TOO LATE, BETRAYER!

36:21.901 --> 36:23.934
RILEY!

36:24.033 --> 36:26.467
HUH...

36:26.567 --> 36:29.067
UGH...

36:29.167 --> 36:31.868
WHERE'D SHE GO?

36:33.567 --> 36:35.133
THE MOUNTAIN WILL CRASH.

36:35.234 --> 36:38.868
THAT WAS THE LAST SIGN.

36:38.968 --> 36:40.667
I THINK SHE'S...

36:40.767 --> 36:43.968
I THINK SHE'S GOING
AFTER THE KID.

36:44.067 --> 36:45.567
SHE'S GOING TO KILL HIM.

36:48.200 --> 36:49.434
<i>KEEP YOUR HEADS UP.</i>

36:49.534 --> 36:50.400
WELL, I'D FEEL A LOT BETTER
DOWN HERE IF WE KNEW

36:50.501 --> 36:51.901
HOW TO KILL THE GUARDIAN.

36:52.000 --> 36:54.467
WELL, WE'LL SEE WHAT
WE CAN DO ABOUT THAT.

36:56.400 --> 37:00.067
ALL RIGHT. I'M LOOKING
FOR WEAKNESSES IN HIS
ARACHNID STRUCTURE.

37:00.167 --> 37:01.334
YEAH, BUT WITH OUT
RILEY'S PSIONIC,

37:01.434 --> 37:03.267
HOW ARE YOU GUYS GOING
TO TRACK DOWN THE CHILD?

37:03.367 --> 37:06.133
COME ON, SHE FOLLOWED
THE BOY; I'LL FOLLOW HER.

37:39.601 --> 37:40.634
RILEY, NO!

37:40.734 --> 37:41.968
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU
THINK, BRENNAN.

37:42.067 --> 37:42.934
I WAS WRONG.

37:43.033 --> 37:44.400
HE ISN'T EVIL.

37:44.501 --> 37:46.434
HE'S JUST A BOY.

37:46.534 --> 37:47.567
HE'S TRICKING HER.

37:47.667 --> 37:48.567
JUST LIKE ASHLOCKE.

37:48.667 --> 37:50.234
HE IS NOTHING LIKE ASHLOCKE.

37:50.334 --> 37:52.234
I'VE LOOKED INSIDE
HIS MIND, BRENNAN.

37:52.334 --> 37:55.701
AND HE'S BEAUTIFUL.

37:55.801 --> 37:59.200
THE OPPOSITE OF
EVERYTHING I THOUGHT.

37:59.300 --> 38:01.801
I TRUST HIM.

38:01.901 --> 38:03.167
BUT THE PROPHECY.

38:03.267 --> 38:06.234
THE THIRD SIGN WAS THE
CHILD SHALL CHOOSE.

38:06.334 --> 38:07.601
AND HE...
HE CHOSE THE GUARDIAN.

38:07.701 --> 38:08.601
NO.

38:08.701 --> 38:11.300
HE CHOSE TO LET US LIVE.

38:11.400 --> 38:14.667
HE FREED HIMSELF FROM THE
PROPHECY BY CHOOSING THAT PATH,

38:14.767 --> 38:18.834
BY FOLLOWING THE GOOD INSIDE.

38:18.934 --> 38:20.834
LET ME TAKE HIM.

38:20.934 --> 38:21.701
NO!

38:21.801 --> 38:22.968
WE CAN RUN FROM THE LINKS.

38:23.067 --> 38:24.334
YOU'LL SPEND THE REST
OF YOUR LIFE RUNNING.

38:24.434 --> 38:26.567
I TOLD YOU, I WOULD
SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE

38:26.667 --> 38:30.267
MAKING UP FOR ASHLOCKE.

38:30.367 --> 38:33.267
THIS IS HOW I WAS
MEANT TO DO IT.

38:33.367 --> 38:36.100
PLEASE DON'T TAKE
THAT FROM ME.

38:40.734 --> 38:46.567
HE WANTS YOU TO
COME WITH US.

38:53.234 --> 38:55.267
I CAN'T.

38:55.367 --> 38:57.334
THEY'LL KILL HIM BEFORE
THEY LET US HAVE HIM.

38:57.434 --> 38:59.534
YOU KNOW THAT.

39:14.434 --> 39:16.467
BRENNAN?

39:18.033 --> 39:20.701
GO.

39:30.467 --> 39:31.400
JESS, A LITTLE HELP.

39:31.501 --> 39:33.501
HOW THE HELL DO WE
KILL THIS THING?

39:33.601 --> 39:35.968
HE MIGHT HAVE A WEAKNESS
IN HIS EXOSKELETON,

39:36.067 --> 39:39.467
SMALL OF HIS BACK,
WHERE THE PLATES OVERLAP.

39:39.567 --> 39:41.300
KEEP HIM BUSY.

39:47.167 --> 39:48.300
C'MON...

39:50.868 --> 39:53.534
AGH...!

40:01.367 --> 40:04.701
WELL, SO MUCH
FOR BISHOP'S PROPHECY.

40:25.634 --> 40:26.601
SORRY.

40:26.701 --> 40:29.000
I GREW RESTLESS
WAITING FOR YOU.

40:29.100 --> 40:30.601
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

40:30.701 --> 40:32.734
HUH?
OH, SLEEPING.

40:32.834 --> 40:34.634
I THOUGHT IT BEST
WE TALK ALONE.

40:34.734 --> 40:36.167
YOU DID WANT TO TALK...

40:36.267 --> 40:38.934
DIDN'T YOU?

40:41.300 --> 40:44.534
YOUR PROPHECY WAS FALSE.

40:44.634 --> 40:45.634
WE LET THE CHILD GO.

40:45.734 --> 40:47.133
THERE WAS NOTHING
EVIL ABOUT HIM.

40:47.234 --> 40:49.067
THERE'S SOMETHING
EVIL ABOUT ALL OF US.

40:49.167 --> 40:52.067
IT'S OUR CHOICE
WHAT FACE WE SHOW.

40:52.167 --> 40:57.300
ASK ME A QUESTION,
MY LITTLE FERAL...

40:59.767 --> 41:03.300
TELL ME HOW IT ENDS.

41:03.400 --> 41:05.901
WHAT HAPPENS TO
ME AND MY FRIENDS.

41:06.000 --> 41:09.434
THE FINAL BATTLE
IS UPON YOU ALL...

41:11.834 --> 41:13.767
FOUR WILL BEGIN.

41:13.868 --> 41:16.067
TRUE LOVE WILL CALL.

41:16.167 --> 41:18.067
ONE WILL BETRAY.

41:18.167 --> 41:21.033
AND ONE WILL FALL.

41:24.934 --> 41:26.801
FALL?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, FALL?

41:26.901 --> 41:28.000
DO YOU MEAN DIE?

41:28.100 --> 41:30.901
<giggles insanely>

41:31.000 --> 41:32.567
TELL ME!

41:35.734 --> 41:38.067
<crying>

41:38.167 --> 41:40.067
DON'T FIGHT IT,
SHALIMAR.

41:40.167 --> 41:44.200
YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS CAN'T
HIDE FROM FATE, SHALIMAR.

41:46.300 --> 41:49.868
IT'S ALREADY FOUND YOU.

41:51.400 --> 41:54.400
CAN WE STOP IT?

41:54.501 --> 41:58.601
SO I HAVE SEEN,
SO IT SHALL BE.

42:00.367 --> 42:02.567
NO. TELL ME!

42:02.667 --> 42:07.267
<laughter>
