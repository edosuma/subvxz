00:07.133 --> 00:08.551
<i>Honey...</i>

00:09.802 --> 00:11.303
<i>What if we stay home tonight?</i>

00:12.888 --> 00:13.889
Let's watch a movie.

00:13.973 --> 00:15.099
7 YEARS AGO

00:15.141 --> 00:16.392
And make popcorn.

00:16.475 --> 00:17.852
And drink some wine.

00:17.935 --> 00:19.103
And then...

00:19.228 --> 00:20.062
And then...

00:26.694 --> 00:30.156
Looks like you need a big sleeper sofa.

00:30.239 --> 00:34.493
We already bought one.
It's big, amazing, comfortable.

00:34.577 --> 00:36.579
For your mother when she comes visit.

00:36.704 --> 00:38.914
Yeah. And this is a good size.

00:39.165 --> 00:42.418
We like to snuggle up, get real close...

00:56.932 --> 00:59.518
Camila, wake up.

00:59.685 --> 01:00.853
-What?
-I wanna pee.

01:00.936 --> 01:01.771
Use the toilet.

01:01.854 --> 01:05.816
Both bathrooms are busy
with your guests. Also,

01:05.900 --> 01:10.029
you owe me the shampoo
that German guy took.

01:10.112 --> 01:12.281
Caco, leave me alone. Go to the kitchen.

01:12.364 --> 01:16.494
Go straight,
there's a bathroom at the end.

01:17.286 --> 01:18.329
Ridiculous.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.153
Inside...

01:52.279 --> 01:54.532
If you change your mind...

02:26.272 --> 02:27.648
Hey, watch out!

02:27.773 --> 02:29.275
Excuse me, please.

02:29.567 --> 02:33.279
You can't be serious
about keeping all that crap in my room.

02:33.362 --> 02:35.781
Cover that, please,
I don't have to look at it.

02:35.865 --> 02:37.783
You already took the biggest room.

02:37.867 --> 02:39.201
The neighbors will see you.

02:39.285 --> 02:42.413
You have strangers sleep in our bed.

02:42.496 --> 02:43.414
"Our" bed?

02:43.455 --> 02:47.376
Meanwhile, I have to sleep
on the sleeper sofa. My sciatica hurts.

02:47.459 --> 02:50.212
Caco, we agreed I'd stay in the suite.

02:50.296 --> 02:53.883
Also, it's none of your concern
who sleeps in my bed.

02:53.966 --> 02:57.177
I'm trying to save the apartment.
Put your underwear on, please.

02:57.428 --> 03:01.473
Not really, since you didn't ask for
the building manager's authorization.

03:01.557 --> 03:04.143
Do you know what happens if they find out?

03:04.226 --> 03:05.561
We get another fine.

03:05.644 --> 03:09.064
Okay, so why don't you sell
your imported car?

03:10.566 --> 03:14.236
Everybody knows that
when a car leaves a dealership,

03:14.445 --> 03:16.697
it starts losing value. I'll lose money.

03:16.780 --> 03:18.866
We have to cut expenses and make money.

03:18.949 --> 03:23.454
I'd rather chase my compensation,
sending e-mails, making phone calls.

03:23.537 --> 03:24.705
It's leaking.

03:25.289 --> 03:27.958
Is it okay if I bring
someone to sleep here?

03:28.334 --> 03:31.045
It's none of my business.

03:31.378 --> 03:32.421
Really?

03:32.504 --> 03:33.756
Really.

03:33.839 --> 03:34.965
Okay.

04:15.089 --> 04:18.509
I'm trying to say I never forgot you.

04:19.218 --> 04:22.096
I missed you all these years.

04:22.680 --> 04:27.101
And now that I divorced Caco,
I'm thinking of you even more.

04:28.352 --> 04:29.895
Please give me another chance.

04:31.730 --> 04:35.651
Yeah, right.
Now that you're alone, you miss me.

04:35.985 --> 04:36.944
Yeah.

04:37.111 --> 04:39.488
You shouldn't have gotten married.

04:39.571 --> 04:42.825
Now, let me hear you say it.

04:43.826 --> 04:46.203
Okay, you were right. I shouldn't have.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.788
Yeah, I shouldn't.

04:49.039 --> 04:50.916
I always knew Caco didn't like me.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.002
For sure, he didn't.

04:53.335 --> 04:55.004
I'd never encourage you to cheat on him.

04:55.087 --> 04:55.963
No?

04:57.047 --> 04:58.966
Only if you asked me.

05:00.342 --> 05:02.511
Oh, honey...

05:02.594 --> 05:06.015
I missed you so.

05:08.225 --> 05:09.393
Dude,

05:09.476 --> 05:14.982
please save me from this house.
I can't stand it.

05:15.941 --> 05:19.611
-What's that smell?
-Man, you'll wake Belinha up.

05:24.241 --> 05:25.743
Not the game controller.

05:25.784 --> 05:27.661
I can't stay here anymore.

05:27.745 --> 05:28.829
Give it to me.

05:29.455 --> 05:30.622
Give it to me.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.877
Good. Give it to me. You can hand it over.

05:35.002 --> 05:35.919
No!

05:40.424 --> 05:41.967
Can I count on you?

05:43.427 --> 05:45.888
I'll see you tomorrow,
if I'm able to walk.

05:45.971 --> 05:47.598
Wanna join Guilherme tomorrow?

05:48.724 --> 05:50.559
I tried. Okay, bye.

05:50.768 --> 05:52.686
That was funny.

06:02.905 --> 06:04.656
-Cami.
-Hey, Ana.

06:04.740 --> 06:06.366
-How are you?
-I didn't see you.

06:06.450 --> 06:07.367
No problem.

06:09.078 --> 06:12.915
<i>Good morning to all the residents</i>
<i>of Ocean Waves.</i>

06:13.540 --> 06:15.834
I wanted to talk to you about Thursday.

06:15.918 --> 06:17.920
Yeah. I was about to call you.

06:18.003 --> 06:22.716
We have to go to Happy Hour
at Palm Springs Mall. Sorry.

06:22.800 --> 06:28.722
I'm hosting some friends from LA
and I need to cancel, too.

06:29.890 --> 06:34.645
I heard your LA friends
aren't paying you enough.

06:34.728 --> 06:38.190
You can charge more.
This condo is a resort.

06:38.273 --> 06:39.274
Do you think so?

06:39.358 --> 06:42.444
Got you! Are you renting a room?

06:42.569 --> 06:44.905
You know that's forbidden at Ocean Waves.

06:44.988 --> 06:49.535
Sorry, Ana, but as soon
as my foreign friends leave,

06:49.618 --> 06:51.662
I'll find some time for us.

06:51.745 --> 06:54.915
Our card game
on Thursday will be a go. Bye.

07:13.058 --> 07:14.393
Marcinho?

07:15.018 --> 07:16.520
Hello, Bugs Bunny.

07:16.603 --> 07:17.688
Your mom kicked you out?

07:17.771 --> 07:20.149
No, not at all.

07:20.732 --> 07:23.861
By the way, my most sincere condolences

07:23.944 --> 07:25.821
for your separation.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.073
Nobody died.

07:28.574 --> 07:29.783
Are you sleeping over?

07:30.409 --> 07:35.497
Yes, and not just tonight. I'm here
to help Caco during this tough time.

07:35.914 --> 07:38.834
Okay, and you will sleep on my couch?

07:38.917 --> 07:43.505
Yes, all the way. You don't have
to sleep with Caco because of me.

07:43.672 --> 07:45.716
This will be very comfortable.

07:45.799 --> 07:46.717
Where is Caco?

07:46.800 --> 07:48.302
He's exercising.

07:48.760 --> 07:49.928
But don't bother him.

07:50.012 --> 07:53.432
He's exercising to get through it.
It's the best thing right now.

07:58.604 --> 07:59.688
Caco!

07:59.771 --> 08:01.064
Caco!

08:01.148 --> 08:05.027
Why is Marcinho staying here
to help you out?

08:05.569 --> 08:07.988
Why is Marcinho here with two suitcases?

08:09.364 --> 08:11.325
-My guest...
-Your guest, really?

08:11.408 --> 08:12.492
How much does he pay?

08:12.576 --> 08:14.036
It's not about the money.

08:14.119 --> 08:15.829
Tell that to our bills.

08:15.913 --> 08:19.583
It's no big deal. He'll only stay
a few days, a week, a month.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.877
-And he's loaded on top of that.
-His mom is.

08:22.461 --> 08:26.965
It doesn't make sense for him to stay
for free when there are people paying.

08:27.257 --> 08:28.926
What a bummer.

08:29.259 --> 08:31.595
How cute. How old are you?

08:31.678 --> 08:33.680
-I'm studying harmonica now.
-Studying?

08:33.764 --> 08:36.058
Caco. Caco.

08:36.725 --> 08:38.977
Let's figure this out.

08:39.144 --> 08:40.187
Caco!

08:40.270 --> 08:41.313
Caco!

08:41.396 --> 08:44.858
Guys, what's going on?
Is that really necessary?

08:45.192 --> 08:46.944
Are we adults or not?

08:47.319 --> 08:49.404
That attracts negativity to the house.

08:54.826 --> 08:55.661
Come on.

08:56.078 --> 08:57.454
That's why I'm here.

08:59.289 --> 09:00.540
That's why I'm here.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.546
Don't you have a blanket?

10:05.022 --> 10:07.399
Caco. Caco!

10:07.482 --> 10:10.736
What? Are you gonna kill me?
A divorce wasn't enough?

10:10.819 --> 10:12.404
-Can't you hear the noise?
-What noise?

10:12.487 --> 10:14.948
Your friend is snoring like a helicopter.

10:15.407 --> 10:16.700
I can't sleep like this.

10:17.367 --> 10:18.660
It doesn't bother me.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.245
-How so?
-I'm used to it.

10:20.329 --> 10:21.955
We slept together for seven years.

10:22.748 --> 10:23.749
That's a lie.

10:24.207 --> 10:25.834
Turn the lights off.

10:35.552 --> 10:37.929
You'll like this one. She lives close by.

10:38.013 --> 10:39.639
Maybe you can see her today.

10:39.723 --> 10:41.391
Man, that's not for me.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.101
I just separated.

10:43.477 --> 10:46.438
Come on, Caco, for God's sake.

10:46.563 --> 10:48.732
All the more reason to go on a date.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.692
Cry me a river.

10:51.109 --> 10:52.944
For God's sake.

10:53.403 --> 10:55.364
Carlos Augusto and Marcio,

10:55.655 --> 11:01.620
please, could you find a place
for your stuff? I need to work here later.

11:01.703 --> 11:04.873
Good morning to you, too.
Did you wake up feeling well?

11:04.956 --> 11:09.002
No, Caco, I couldn't sleep
because someone snored.

11:11.296 --> 11:12.297
I didn't hear anything.

11:19.304 --> 11:23.767
You can meet this girl today.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.268
But her name is Ludo.

11:25.769 --> 11:27.521
It's like a guy's name.

11:27.687 --> 11:31.358
You're doing that to piss me off.

11:31.441 --> 11:32.317
Let's see.

11:32.401 --> 11:34.528
Like her profile and check it out.

11:34.611 --> 11:35.654
Good.

11:40.242 --> 11:42.702
-Perfect place.
-Is it a good spot?

11:44.621 --> 11:47.374
-Let's take a pic, Marcinho.
-From this angle?

11:47.457 --> 11:50.252
Get this angle to show I'm from Barra.

11:50.794 --> 11:52.754
Let me just take this off.

11:53.630 --> 11:56.550
Let's take a very good pic.

11:56.633 --> 11:59.803
Great. Yes, show you're worth it.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.471
Puff up your chest. Posture!

12:01.555 --> 12:03.473
-You're a new man.
-A macho man.

12:03.765 --> 12:05.934
-I'll open my legs a little.
-Good.

12:06.101 --> 12:07.519
One vertical shot.

12:07.602 --> 12:09.771
Too stiff. Let's get moving.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.440
Let's take a walk, relax…

12:11.523 --> 12:13.859
I'll pass by and you take the pics.

12:13.942 --> 12:16.486
-Very natural.
-Excellent.

12:16.570 --> 12:20.574
Now, smile like a womanizer. Now, walk.

12:20.657 --> 12:22.659
I like the leap. That's cool.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.870
Walk, take a leap again...

12:25.162 --> 12:26.079
-Nice.
-Natural.

12:26.163 --> 12:27.372
I'm walking...

12:27.456 --> 12:29.833
-I leapt.
-Let's do something.

12:30.041 --> 12:33.712
Butterfly caught by surprise.
It was flying, then...

12:34.254 --> 12:35.547
Just out of the cocoon.

12:35.630 --> 12:38.216
You know? You just got out of your cocoon.

12:38.884 --> 12:40.469
-Like...
-Out of the cocoon.

12:40.552 --> 12:43.930
-Cocoon, arms, freedom.
-Yeah, you're flying.

12:44.014 --> 12:46.266
Arms, fly, do that...

12:46.433 --> 12:52.314
Yeah, wave your arms, worship
this flying energy, this metamorphosis...

12:52.397 --> 12:56.651
Yeah. Great. Very good.

12:56.735 --> 13:00.572
Now you are an evolved man.
Let's try something more spiritual.

13:00.655 --> 13:01.490
-More Zen.
-Like yoga.

13:01.573 --> 13:02.616
Yoga, that's it.

13:02.699 --> 13:06.578
Get the car to show I'm spiritual,
but I have money.

13:08.788 --> 13:09.831
Good.

13:12.083 --> 13:13.460
Put your hands there.

13:13.543 --> 13:14.419
Good.

13:14.503 --> 13:16.713
-Should I look up at the sky?
-Nice one.

13:17.297 --> 13:21.009
Great. Now take your shirt off.

13:22.427 --> 13:23.261
Take it off.

13:27.432 --> 13:28.558
Hey, Coach,

13:28.642 --> 13:30.393
losing weight is too hard.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.312
You gotta eat more protein.

13:32.395 --> 13:34.856
-Okay.
-Thank you, bye.

13:37.234 --> 13:39.986
Hello, Camila!

13:42.864 --> 13:45.492
Just so you know,
my offer is still available.

13:46.618 --> 13:49.746
But, you know,
if you keep violating the condo rules,

13:49.829 --> 13:52.582
renting rooms and getting more fines,

13:53.166 --> 13:55.043
we'll have to make a new deal.

14:02.717 --> 14:06.179
<i>Good morning from Ocean Waves.</i>

14:08.181 --> 14:09.766
But don't worry, Camila.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.686
I won't tell the Residents' Association.

14:13.311 --> 14:15.730
A friend never snitches.

14:15.814 --> 14:20.986
Don't worry,
I'm very good at keeping secrets.

14:21.069 --> 14:25.490
Thank you, Guilherme, but you don't
have to. I don't have any secrets.

14:28.076 --> 14:29.953
-See you later.
-See you.

14:31.329 --> 14:33.748
Let me know if you change your mind.

14:55.729 --> 14:56.896
Sorry, Camila.

14:56.980 --> 15:00.400
We're really sorry.
But traffic was really bad.

15:00.483 --> 15:02.944
No problem, your timing is perfect.

15:03.486 --> 15:04.321
Excuse me.

15:04.404 --> 15:08.116
-Make yourselves at home.
-Wow, your apartment is beautiful.

15:08.992 --> 15:11.202
Thank you. Indeed.

15:11.494 --> 15:13.872
It's my private paradise.

15:13.955 --> 15:16.041
Thanks to My New Fabulous.

15:16.708 --> 15:19.919
Carol gave me some products. I loved it.

15:20.003 --> 15:22.589
I really need something

15:22.672 --> 15:24.174
to boost my self-esteem.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.634
Yeah, that's important.

15:25.842 --> 15:29.471
Let me tell you
My New Fabulous is not just a brand.

15:29.554 --> 15:31.139
It's a lifestyle.

15:31.514 --> 15:33.016
Good afternoon.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.934
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

15:37.395 --> 15:39.230
So, as I was saying...

15:40.273 --> 15:43.610
-If someone asked me...
-Sorry for interrupting.

15:46.237 --> 15:47.197
No problem.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.406
-It's fine.
-It's fine.

15:49.991 --> 15:51.534
As I was saying...

15:51.618 --> 15:55.330
If someone asked me
for a definition for My New Fabulous,

15:55.413 --> 15:58.458
I'll definitely say female empowerment.

15:58.541 --> 16:01.169
Sorry to interrupt again.

16:01.503 --> 16:03.421
Camila, I'll be in my room.

16:03.588 --> 16:06.049
If you need me,

16:06.132 --> 16:07.092
just shout.

16:07.258 --> 16:09.594
If you wanna give them my number,

16:10.679 --> 16:12.430
-please feel free.
-Sure.

16:12.514 --> 16:13.890
-We'll get it.
-Thanks.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.601
-Be my guest.
-Thank you.

16:18.687 --> 16:20.480
You can't choose your family.

16:29.531 --> 16:30.657
Hi, Paty.

16:31.074 --> 16:32.200
Hi, Caco.

16:33.368 --> 16:35.120
-It's been a while.
-Yeah.

16:36.538 --> 16:37.539
Come on in.

16:42.210 --> 16:45.004
Hello, Paty. It's been a while.

16:45.088 --> 16:47.549
Last time I saw you, you were a brunette.
Remember?

16:48.258 --> 16:49.259
I do remember.

16:49.926 --> 16:51.678
How could I forget that time

16:51.761 --> 16:54.514
when the cops got your car
and I had to walk?

16:54.973 --> 16:56.766
You still resent it.

16:57.183 --> 16:58.518
So, where's Camila?

16:58.893 --> 16:59.894
In her room.

17:07.068 --> 17:08.611
Come on.

17:09.404 --> 17:11.114
You're still in your pajamas?

17:12.282 --> 17:15.869
Go get dressed,
Mateo is bringing a hottie.

17:16.161 --> 17:17.787
Lower your voice.

17:19.914 --> 17:21.207
Are you single or not?

17:21.291 --> 17:24.544
Yes, I am, but they don't need to know
about my life.

17:28.173 --> 17:29.340
I don't know.

17:29.924 --> 17:31.050
This won't go well.

17:31.342 --> 17:33.094
Yeah, it won't.

17:35.096 --> 17:36.014
Paty,

17:36.347 --> 17:38.725
I'm not feeling so excited.

17:39.184 --> 17:41.644
Just the thought of wearing heels

17:41.728 --> 17:43.354
gives my feet blisters.

17:43.897 --> 17:45.106
Stop being lazy.

17:45.190 --> 17:46.816
-Why?
-Go get dressed.

17:47.317 --> 17:50.153
I think it's early to go on a date.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.447
Caco had a bad week.

17:52.530 --> 17:53.907
He'll suffer.

17:54.032 --> 17:55.700
It's very inconsiderate.

18:00.246 --> 18:01.247
Wake up.

18:01.498 --> 18:04.751
-What?
-He's doing really well on the apps.

18:06.586 --> 18:07.629
Wanna see?

18:12.175 --> 18:13.426
Surprised?

18:14.135 --> 18:18.014
I'm appalled.

18:18.932 --> 18:22.936
Look at the six-pack he doesn't have.

18:23.019 --> 18:24.687
-He photoshopped it.
-Let me see.

18:25.939 --> 18:27.190
Wow.

18:27.899 --> 18:29.359
It's nice.

18:37.700 --> 18:40.328
Have fun playing video games.

18:45.291 --> 18:50.255
Oh, man, Camila is going for it tonight.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.508
She really is.

18:55.552 --> 18:56.845
You're going to lose.

18:56.928 --> 18:59.973
<i>Goal!</i>

19:00.056 --> 19:01.307
Pay attention, man.

19:25.081 --> 19:27.208
Sorry, did I wake you up?

19:27.292 --> 19:28.960
No, I was asleep.

19:29.460 --> 19:30.420
Good night.

19:31.212 --> 19:32.046
So...

19:33.006 --> 19:33.923
Was it good?

19:34.007 --> 19:37.760
Yes, it was great.

19:40.263 --> 19:41.264
Good night.

19:42.265 --> 19:43.099
Good night.

20:18.301 --> 20:20.011
<i>Did you make it home safely?</i>

20:20.094 --> 20:22.889
You reminded me
of why I stopped going out.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.308
<i>Come on, don't exaggerate.</i>

20:26.643 --> 20:27.894
Tell me something, then.

20:28.019 --> 20:30.563
Is all that harassment normal
or the lawyers are on strike?

20:30.647 --> 20:32.690
<i>I said we should've gone for the VIP pass.</i>

20:32.774 --> 20:33.733
Patricia,

20:33.816 --> 20:36.444
leave me alone.
I need to recover from trauma.

20:36.527 --> 20:37.528
<i>Good night.</i>

21:25.076 --> 21:25.910
Caco.

21:26.536 --> 21:27.370
Caco!

21:28.913 --> 21:30.373
Come on, Camila.

21:30.456 --> 21:32.458
You keep finding excuses

21:32.542 --> 21:34.335
-to come see me.
-Cut it out.

21:34.794 --> 21:35.962
What is it now?

21:36.045 --> 21:39.841
I just caught Marcinho jerking off
in the living room.

21:39.924 --> 21:41.342
-On the couch?
-Yeah!

21:41.801 --> 21:42.885
Oh, man.

21:43.302 --> 21:44.470
Caco, you win.

21:44.554 --> 21:46.889
I'll stop renting the room
in three months,

21:46.973 --> 21:49.225
but get him out of here, I beg you.

21:50.977 --> 21:54.439
Sorry, Camila,
I won't kick my best friend out.

21:54.522 --> 21:56.649
Now, let me sleep.

21:56.733 --> 22:00.153
Or do you want me to go to your room
and put you to bed?

22:01.070 --> 22:02.405
Ridiculous.

22:14.667 --> 22:15.793
Caco.

22:17.712 --> 22:18.629
Caco.

22:21.132 --> 22:22.133
Marcinho.

22:30.516 --> 22:32.810
Yuk, Marcinho!

22:52.622 --> 22:55.625
Wait, what's happening? Camila!

23:00.588 --> 23:02.507
Man, did Camila sell the couch?

23:03.716 --> 23:05.635
<i>Access denied.</i>

23:06.094 --> 23:08.096
<i>Access denied.</i>

23:15.228 --> 23:16.854
Things are getting really bad.

23:17.396 --> 23:20.900
Shit, I didn't pay the electricity bill.

23:30.618 --> 23:31.869
Shit!

23:32.120 --> 23:34.122
I'll find a way into this sauna.
