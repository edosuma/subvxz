[PHYLA]
Guardians of the Galaxy,

00:04.204 --> 00:06.405
you are accused of high crimes

00:06.440 --> 00:08.140
against the Kree Empire,

00:08.175 --> 00:11.577
and will be detained here
until your trial.

00:13.880 --> 00:15.213
[GAMORA] Brace yourselves, Guardians.

00:15.248 --> 00:17.583
Kree prisons are notoriously harsh.

00:18.752 --> 00:20.152
And yet Drax finds this one

00:20.187 --> 00:21.587
sleekly designed.

I am Groot.

00:37.370 --> 00:38.503
[ROCKET]
Hoo hoo!

00:38.538 --> 00:39.938
I always wanted to be thrown

00:39.973 --> 00:41.173
into a place like this.

00:41.208 --> 00:43.108
Seriously, Rocket?
You wanted to be thrown

00:43.143 --> 00:45.110
into a place that looks
like my grandmother's house?

00:45.145 --> 00:48.080
Flarg, yeah.
The cells are modular.

00:48.115 --> 00:49.381
They move around at random,

00:49.416 --> 00:51.550
so it's impossible to plan an escape...

00:51.585 --> 00:53.051
for anyone but me, of course.

00:53.086 --> 00:54.453
Welcome, dearies,

00:54.488 --> 00:56.555

01:08.935 --> 01:10.569

01:10.604 --> 01:12.971
Deviate from my rules,

01:13.006 --> 01:15.373

01:15.408 --> 01:18.310
No one escapes from my facility.

Okay, look, I get it.

01:30.690 --> 01:33.258
Every fiber of your being
is telling you to escape.

01:33.293 --> 01:34.726
But this time, we got to stay put

01:34.761 --> 01:37.229
so we can go to trial
and prove our innocence.

01:37.264 --> 01:40.999
[GAMORA] Hate to say it,
Rocket, but Quill's right.

01:41.034 --> 01:44.269
For once, resist your natural
instinct to be yourself.

01:44.304 --> 01:46.071
So the rumors are true.

01:46.106 --> 01:49.107

Yaah!

01:50.877 --> 01:51.943
[GROANING]

01:51.978 --> 01:56.248
Violent intent is an infraction
of Doctor Minn-Erva's rules.

01:56.283 --> 01:58.850
It's the rehab module for both of you.

01:58.885 --> 02:00.218
No.

02:00.253 --> 02:02.221
Not the rehab module!

Seriously delusional.

03:02.082 --> 03:03.882
Very well, counselor.

03:03.917 --> 03:06.484
You can start by making
a full confession.

03:06.519 --> 03:08.486
What? Wh...
That we were tricked

03:08.521 --> 03:10.555
into stealing some mystery
box from the Kree,

03:10.590 --> 03:12.257
which was stolen from us?

03:12.292 --> 03:15.527
If you will not confess
the location of the item,

03:15.562 --> 03:17.696
then your only hope
is for a friendly witness

03:17.731 --> 03:19.164
to testify on your behalf.

03:19.199 --> 03:22.267
Okay, we saved the galaxy,

Yes. They all came
to testify...

Fandral.

03:45.258 --> 03:47.359
Fandral of Asgard,

03:47.394 --> 03:48.793
is it possible

03:48.828 --> 03:50.262
the Guardians could have breached

03:50.297 --> 03:53.465
a secure Kree facility and robbed it?

03:53.500 --> 03:56.368
By all means.
They are excellent thieves.

03:56.403 --> 03:58.536
If anything in the galaxy went missing...
[CHUCKLES]

03:58.571 --> 04:01.206
I would wager it was
stolen by the Guardians,

04:01.241 --> 04:05.277
especially that rascal Peter Quill.

Silence.

04:08.515 --> 04:11.249
The Supreme Intelligence
will have order.

04:11.284 --> 04:14.819
The accused will step forward
and confess their crime

04:14.854 --> 04:17.622

04:17.656 --> 04:20.225
Okay, Your Blobbiness,

04:20.260 --> 04:22.427
I admit that it looks
like we're guilty.

04:22.462 --> 04:24.596
But here is the twist.

04:24.631 --> 04:26.131
We were set up,

04:26.166 --> 04:28.466
framed by a con artist and schemer

04:28.501 --> 04:31.136

05:04.471 --> 05:06.371
I won't rat out a fellow outlaw.

It's part of the Outlaw Code.

05:08.475 --> 05:10.342

05:10.377 --> 05:12.344
Somebody must have set up Howard.

05:12.379 --> 05:14.813

05:17.851 --> 05:20.819

You will undergo severe interrogation

05:26.659 --> 05:27.792
after which

05:27.827 --> 05:30.228
you will be executed

the better.

I don't need you to turn the Guardians

12:23.743 --> 12:25.943
into model citizens,
Minn-Erva.

12:25.978 --> 12:27.745
I need a confession!

12:27.780 --> 12:29.313
You are compromising Kree justice

12:29.348 --> 12:31.048
for your own personal obsession.

12:31.083 --> 12:33.551
You may be an Accuser, dearie,

12:33.586 --> 12:35.753
but don't think you can accuse me.

12:35.788 --> 12:38.589
I will have results within the hour.

12:38.624 --> 12:42.093
Sadly, Rocket, we've run out of time.

12:42.128 --> 12:45.062
Hey, I got all day.

12:45.097 --> 12:48.399
The cranial interrogator
can take you back,

12:48.434 --> 12:51.736
back to the time your
behavior problems began.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.838
You can start afresh,

12:53.873 --> 12:56.073
if you survive.

13:10.389 --> 13:12.156

Rocket asked for.

13:12.191 --> 13:14.025
[GAMORA]
Almost everything.

13:14.060 --> 13:16.661
I am Groot.

13:17.897 --> 13:19.463
Without Rocket, we still have no idea

13:19.498 --> 13:20.865
what to do with any of it.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.612
I am Groot!

Rocket, I know you want to be good,

13:51.864 --> 13:55.700
and I have made you something
to help you do just that.

13:55.735 --> 13:59.503
Comply, and the pain will all stop.

That's right, punks!

Who's a distraction now, huh?
[LAUGHS]

Oh, good. Whew.
You're still yourself.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.597
I'm better than myself.

14:26.632 --> 14:29.968
I'm a good little rodent now.

14:34.373 --> 14:36.908
Your friends have broken my rules.

14:36.943 --> 14:38.409
Subdue them.

14:38.444 --> 14:40.378
You don't have to listen to her.

Rocket, no! Uhh!

14:48.921 --> 14:50.788
That woman has damaged your mind.

14:50.823 --> 14:54.859
She freed my mind. Raah!

Now, be a good little rodent

15:05.137 --> 15:07.972
and put your friends
in the TIMEOUT box,

15:08.007 --> 15:09.741
would you, dearie?

15:13.346 --> 15:14.645
Uhh!
Aah!

Aah!
Uhh!

There we are.
Eh...

15:30.429 --> 15:32.964
A good little rodent.

15:36.702 --> 15:39.103
She did it. She actually broke him.

15:39.138 --> 15:40.972
And from the looks of that light show,

15:41.007 --> 15:42.307
I'd say we're next.

15:45.778 --> 15:48.412
[ECHOING] Okay, everybody,
resist the mind control.

15:48.447 --> 15:49.947
Think of my favorite songs.

15:49.982 --> 15:51.682
[ECHOING]
We hate your songs.

15:51.717 --> 15:53.150
Fine. But whatever you do,

15:53.185 --> 15:54.919
don't stare at the...

15:54.954 --> 15:56.187
the...

15:56.222 --> 15:57.388

[ROCKET] If you're watching this,
then either I'm krutacked,

16:07.133 --> 16:09.600
or my plan is working perfectly.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.502
You losers better have
all the components,

16:11.537 --> 16:13.004
'cause you're gonna rig them up here

16:13.039 --> 16:15.540
inside the TIMEOUT box.

16:18.044 --> 16:19.610
Ha! See?

16:19.645 --> 16:21.812
Even creepy granny lady
can't stop Rocket

16:21.847 --> 16:23.047
from being Rocket.

16:23.082 --> 16:24.882
I am Groot!

16:27.653 --> 16:29.687
[DRAX] But did Rocket leave
us these instructions

16:29.722 --> 16:32.323
before or after he was rehabilitated?

16:34.927 --> 16:37.661
So neat and well behaved.
[CHUCKLES]

16:37.696 --> 16:40.231
Now I need you to confess the location

16:40.266 --> 16:42.400
of the item you stole from the Kree.

16:42.435 --> 16:45.336
I do not know where it is.

16:45.371 --> 16:47.304
I believe you, dearie,

16:47.339 --> 16:50.207
but your friends may
know something more.

16:50.242 --> 16:52.043
I will get them to confess.

16:52.078 --> 16:54.845
Please, may I do that for you?

Oh, you are such a good little rodent.

Get to work.

17:14.133 --> 17:15.398
But you hugged her.

17:15.434 --> 17:18.368
Yeah, so I could swipe these!

17:18.404 --> 17:22.173
Now would be a good time
to tell us what your plan is.

17:22.208 --> 17:23.941
So, you know all the power outages

17:23.976 --> 17:25.710
you guys caused getting this stuff?

17:28.247 --> 17:31.182
Well, the generator's
already rerouted all systems

17:31.217 --> 17:33.217
to the biggest power
consumer in the place:

of the Galaxy.

18:45.991 --> 18:48.960
We don't just break rules,
we obliterate them.

18:55.634 --> 18:58.736
Then obliteration
is what you shall receive.

19:00.206 --> 19:02.106
If you will not be rehabilitated,

19:02.141 --> 19:03.908
you will be punished.

20:16.382 --> 20:19.183
So rude.
Didn't even say "please."

20:19.218 --> 20:22.320
I think some naughty warden
needs a little rehabilitation.

Aaahh!

20:29.428 --> 20:31.795
I'm thinking an outpatient program.

the un-devourable.

Never mind.

21:09.868 --> 21:11.268
I think we have bigger issues,

21:11.303 --> 21:13.904
like tracking down
that stolen Kree package

21:13.939 --> 21:15.906
and clearing our names.

No. I won't rat out Howard.
