00:55.787 --> 00:58.390
Hello!

00:58.423 --> 01:00.859
-How are you?
-You're up early, Mr. Mayor.

01:03.462 --> 01:06.799
Well, wait a second.

01:08.834 --> 01:12.605
My last two chewy candies!
I was looking for those.

01:12.638 --> 01:14.140
We'd give you a lift
back into town,

01:14.173 --> 01:15.575
but Myrna here
has got the croup.

01:17.275 --> 01:18.710
Okay.

01:18.743 --> 01:21.180
Well, I could use the walk.
Gives me time to think.

01:21.212 --> 01:22.848
Well, there's plenty of time
for that around here.

01:22.882 --> 01:24.250
Yes.

01:24.283 --> 01:26.652
You know, if I take
the back way...

01:26.685 --> 01:29.355
Okay, bye bye now.

01:42.367 --> 01:45.271
Paint the sign...

01:45.304 --> 01:46.573
What's next?

01:57.849 --> 02:00.385
We'll be looking
at a mild day and night today

02:00.418 --> 02:02.621
in Southern New Jersey,
with temperatures reaching 70

02:02.655 --> 02:05.457
by the afternoon,
and a low tonight of 55,

02:05.490 --> 02:06.792
which will make it
a nice night

02:06.825 --> 02:09.294
for all you ghosts
and goblins out there.

02:14.766 --> 02:16.868
-Up already.
-Who can sleep?

02:16.901 --> 02:18.537
Did you get the paper?

02:20.772 --> 02:23.643
"Paul Davison,
Lullaby's principal landowner

02:23.675 --> 02:24.843
and dairy farm proprietor..."

02:24.877 --> 02:26.412
Skip to the end.

02:26.444 --> 02:28.580
"Despite a few objections
to the rotolactor,

02:28.614 --> 02:30.449
including mayor Clark Hill..."

02:30.481 --> 02:33.618
"Due to Mr. Davison's
foresight and persistence,

02:33.651 --> 02:36.522
the milk business in Lullaby
might not go sour."

02:39.792 --> 02:41.627
Well, now what's this?

02:41.659 --> 02:45.564
Something for your foresight
and persistence.

02:45.598 --> 02:47.333
What a gal.

02:50.868 --> 02:54.507
I love it.

02:54.539 --> 02:59.211
I've always wanted a toy statue
of the empire state building.

03:05.651 --> 03:07.687
Say, hon, do me a favor

03:07.719 --> 03:10.590
and shine my shoes
for me, will you?

03:10.622 --> 03:12.290
Okay.

03:12.324 --> 03:15.995
You, you're the tops.

03:18.764 --> 03:20.533
Ann, breakfast.

03:20.566 --> 03:22.001
No time. Gotta go.

03:22.033 --> 03:23.635
Please take Ziggy with you.

03:23.669 --> 03:25.304
I'm not his babysitter.

03:25.336 --> 03:27.339
No, you're his cousin.

03:27.372 --> 03:29.341
Second cousin, once removed.

03:29.375 --> 03:31.409
I kinda wish he was removed
from our house.

03:31.443 --> 03:34.247
He's family, Ann, and he's only
been with us a week,

03:34.280 --> 03:35.681
so please be nice.

03:35.713 --> 03:37.515
Come on, Ziggy!

03:37.549 --> 03:39.652
Ziggy, let's go!
You're like molasses.

03:39.685 --> 03:41.954
He's from Poland,
he doesn't speak english.

03:41.986 --> 03:44.389
Ziggy, let's go!
You're like Polish molasses.

03:54.932 --> 03:57.469
Ceremony 4:00!

03:57.502 --> 03:59.037
-Don't forget!
-How could I?

03:59.070 --> 04:00.406
That's all you people
talk about.

04:20.858 --> 04:22.627
Sorry I'm late again, gang.

04:22.661 --> 04:24.797
Guess it's time
for that new alarm clock.

04:30.968 --> 04:34.406
Let's jump right in with...

04:39.110 --> 04:41.447
"I heard the voice
of the lord saying

04:41.480 --> 04:43.081
'whom shall I send
and who will go for us?'

04:43.115 --> 04:45.285
then said I,
'here am I, send me.'"

04:48.454 --> 04:49.788
start with that one?

04:51.523 --> 04:53.026
Maybe another one?

04:54.992 --> 04:57.096
Any requests?

04:57.129 --> 05:00.665
Tomorrow is Halloween.
Do you know what that means?

05:00.699 --> 05:02.435
Candy!

05:02.468 --> 05:06.439
It means, for one night you can
let go of your inhibitions

05:06.471 --> 05:09.308
and become someone
completely different.

05:12.944 --> 05:14.612
What are inhibitions?

05:14.646 --> 05:17.983
Well, they're... they're things
that hold you back.

05:18.016 --> 05:19.752
From what?

05:28.826 --> 05:32.130
Chardy Edwards,
you scared us to death.

05:32.163 --> 05:34.500
Peg, I'm gonna remember
that look on your face forever.

05:34.533 --> 05:35.701
That was hilarious.

05:35.733 --> 05:37.736
I was hoping you'd stop by.

05:37.769 --> 05:39.504
-You must be a mind reader.
-I must be.

05:39.538 --> 05:40.805
You know why?

05:40.838 --> 05:43.408
'Cause I knew
you'd say that.

05:43.442 --> 05:45.110
Stop it, Chardy,
the kids are right there.

05:45.144 --> 05:47.612
Well, they're gonna have
to learn about love

05:47.646 --> 05:49.081
sooner or later.

05:49.113 --> 05:52.685
Peg, I love you so much,
I could explode.

06:14.139 --> 06:16.408
Morning!
Morn...

06:16.442 --> 06:18.843
Hey, good morning, Mr. Mayor.

06:18.877 --> 06:22.014
Nice to see you.
Nice to see you, too.

06:22.047 --> 06:25.551
How are you? Well, I'm just
remarkable, thank you.

06:25.584 --> 06:27.752
<i>Today in war-frightened Europe</i>

06:27.786 --> 06:29.622
<i>German chancellor
Adolf Hitler declared</i>

06:29.654 --> 06:31.556
<i>he would not allow
an alien race</i>

06:31.589 --> 06:34.459
<i>to control
his country's destiny.</i>

06:34.492 --> 06:36.060
That German's
got the whole world

06:36.093 --> 06:37.963
on pins and needles.

06:39.197 --> 06:41.166
Crazier than a rat
in a tin can.

06:41.199 --> 06:44.702
A rat in a tin can with tanks.

06:44.735 --> 06:46.070
And guns.

06:46.103 --> 06:48.574
-Coffee, Mr. Mayor?
-Thank you very much.

06:48.607 --> 06:51.944
Nothing like a piping hot cup
of pepper's famous motor oil.

06:51.976 --> 06:54.479
Here come
the rockefellers.

06:56.882 --> 06:59.617
-Hey, sheriff.
-Mr. davison.

06:59.651 --> 07:02.521
-Hello, Clark.
-Lorraine, good morning.

07:02.553 --> 07:03.521
How are things?

07:03.555 --> 07:05.624
Good, good, good, good.

07:05.656 --> 07:06.625
Busy.
how are you?

07:06.658 --> 07:07.693
A big, big day for Paul.

07:07.725 --> 07:09.161
Sure is, thank you.

07:09.194 --> 07:10.830
You're still reading,
"gone with the wind."

07:10.862 --> 07:12.064
You've been at that
for a couple of weeks.

07:12.096 --> 07:13.832
I'm such a slow reader,

07:13.865 --> 07:16.568
-but thank you for the recommendation.
-Sure, sure.

07:16.601 --> 07:19.537
Such a beautiful love story.
I'm really enjoying it.

07:19.571 --> 07:20.940
Good,
I'm glad you like it.

07:20.973 --> 07:23.843
I... I... I would always
find myself re-reading

07:23.875 --> 07:25.743
-that section where...
-Clark!

07:25.776 --> 07:27.146
Paul.

07:27.178 --> 07:29.681
Say, were you able to get
that sign painted,

07:29.714 --> 07:33.151
"Chosen as the Home
of the Rotolactor?"

07:33.185 --> 07:36.788
I... I... I... thought it was
just "Home of the Rotolactor."

07:36.822 --> 07:38.057
No, it's gotta say,
"Chosen as."

07:38.089 --> 07:40.091
-That's important.
-Okay, then, okay, okay.

07:40.125 --> 07:43.661
And the tablecloths
and apple cider, all set?

07:43.694 --> 07:45.730
-Yep, that's next on my list. Next on my list.
-All right.

07:45.764 --> 07:50.970
Cause this isn't some barbeque or
manure stacking contest, Clark.

07:51.002 --> 07:53.004
It's been a long time
since I've planned

07:53.038 --> 07:55.540
a manure stacking contest.

07:55.574 --> 07:58.644
Clark, listen, I know we've had
our differences about this,

07:58.677 --> 08:01.980
and you're worried first
it's a cow milking machine,

08:02.014 --> 08:04.884
next a factory
and a train station pop up,

08:04.916 --> 08:07.652
and before you know it,
we're a Metropolis,

08:07.685 --> 08:09.187
but, trust me, pal,

08:09.221 --> 08:11.656
change only comes

08:11.689 --> 08:15.995
when you take bold
leaps forward.

08:16.028 --> 08:17.997
You oughta write that
in your little diary.

08:25.603 --> 08:27.305
You really want me...
Okay, yep.

08:27.338 --> 08:30.242
-Change only comes when...
-Yeah, I got it, I got it.

08:30.274 --> 08:32.110
-You take bold...
-I got it. I got it.

08:32.144 --> 08:34.145
-He's got it, Paul.
-All right, good.

08:36.148 --> 08:38.984
Well, you should welcome advice
about taking charge, Clark.

08:39.017 --> 08:41.820
-Yeah, sure.
-I mean, you're the mayor.

08:41.852 --> 08:43.755
It's in the job description.

08:45.356 --> 08:48.059
Thank you for your help, Clark.

08:48.092 --> 08:49.728
Good seeing you.

08:58.370 --> 09:00.105
More coffee, Mr. Mayor?

09:02.740 --> 09:05.877
Reverend Rogers,
Helen and I couldn't find you

09:05.910 --> 09:08.713
after mass last week.
You left so quickly.

09:08.746 --> 09:10.915
I wanted to talk about
my brother Joe's passing.

09:10.948 --> 09:14.652
Have you
learned anything

09:14.686 --> 09:15.988
from this time
of trial, Stan?

09:16.020 --> 09:17.188
You bet.

09:17.221 --> 09:18.624
When a cow kicks you
in the leg,

09:18.657 --> 09:19.959
it don't feel like much.

09:19.991 --> 09:22.226
But if she nails you
just right in the head,

09:22.259 --> 09:24.295
boy, you're done for.

09:24.328 --> 09:26.064
Very spiritual.

09:26.097 --> 09:28.866
No, tell him about
the passage you found.

09:28.899 --> 09:32.236
Yeah, "they are plans
for peace and not disaster,

09:32.269 --> 09:35.640
to give you a future
and a hope."

09:35.673 --> 09:38.110
Exodus chapter eight.
That's one of my favorites.

09:38.143 --> 09:40.812
No, it's from Jeremiah,
chapter 29?

09:40.846 --> 09:43.014
I always get
those two confused.

09:43.048 --> 09:45.618
Well, I'll keep your brother,
Jonathan, in my prayers.

09:45.650 --> 09:48.086
-My brother was Joe.
-I'll pray for them both.

09:58.096 --> 10:00.231
Come on!
We're sitting ducks out here.

10:02.100 --> 10:03.869
-Think he saw us?
-Don't move! Stay down!

10:03.902 --> 10:05.871
Hi, Peter.
How you doing

10:05.903 --> 10:07.005
fine.

10:07.038 --> 10:09.140
Hey, lovebirds,
shut the hell up.

10:09.173 --> 10:11.175
Do you want him to hear us?

10:11.208 --> 10:13.878
Look, my folks said that when
Collins came back from the war.

10:13.912 --> 10:15.346
He was all messed up.

10:15.379 --> 10:17.015
Maybe he blew away
a thousand krauts,

10:17.048 --> 10:18.350
blasting their brains out.

10:18.383 --> 10:20.285
Who knows what he does
in there all day?

10:20.317 --> 10:23.688
Here, throw it.

10:23.721 --> 10:26.191
Why is it warm?

10:26.224 --> 10:28.794
Is this pee?
Gross.

10:28.826 --> 10:30.763
Is it true that Ziggy's
an imbecile in the head

10:30.796 --> 10:32.898
-'cause he never talks?
-You're an imbecile.

10:32.931 --> 10:34.233
He's Polish.

10:34.265 --> 10:36.367
Our family sent him here
'cause of Hitler.

10:36.400 --> 10:38.336
-Ever listen to the radio?
-Okay, here we go.

10:38.370 --> 10:40.272
If he comes out,
don't look him in the eyes.

10:40.304 --> 10:41.373
Just keep moving.

10:46.077 --> 10:47.145
Ew!

10:55.721 --> 10:58.256
These last few years
haven't been easy,

10:58.289 --> 11:02.827
but today we look ahead
at brighter days to come...

11:02.860 --> 11:07.899
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm proud to present

11:07.932 --> 11:09.301
the rotolactor.

11:12.971 --> 11:15.073
And then I'll say
something like...

11:16.508 --> 11:19.211
This is a modern marvel.

11:19.244 --> 11:24.716
How it can milk
15 cows at once.

11:24.750 --> 11:27.318
And Clark, this is where
you're gonna lead the cows in.

11:27.351 --> 11:28.754
Yeah, okay.

11:30.154 --> 11:32.757
Then I'm gonna tug
on the heartstrings

11:32.791 --> 11:34.326
a little bit.

11:34.359 --> 11:36.929
Our fields are drying up.

11:36.961 --> 11:40.899
You're working your fingers to
the bone, barely getting by.

11:40.932 --> 11:43.302
Events in Europe
are drawing us ever closer

11:43.335 --> 11:45.937
to an inevitable world war.

11:48.005 --> 11:50.775
I say change only comes

11:50.808 --> 11:54.480
when you take
bold leaps forward.

11:56.280 --> 11:59.450
Well, that's it. Now what
do you say we fire this up?

11:59.484 --> 12:00.953
Absolutely.

12:12.798 --> 12:14.767
-And all these buttons...
-Yeah?

12:14.799 --> 12:16.501
Designed and built in Florida.

12:16.534 --> 12:19.203
I think it's the future
in dairy farming.

12:19.236 --> 12:20.905
The fut...

12:25.943 --> 12:29.147
And when the time is...

12:34.186 --> 12:36.889
My God!

12:36.922 --> 12:39.291
-Has it got rotors on it?
-Yeah, get over here!

12:39.323 --> 12:41.492
-Dump it right on there?
-Yeah, get out of the way!

12:41.525 --> 12:42.560
Get out of the way!

12:45.529 --> 12:48.900
I cannot believe it.
This is a disaster.

12:48.933 --> 12:50.336
God!

13:01.111 --> 13:03.248
Chardy!

13:13.258 --> 13:15.160
You're damn right I'm upset.

13:15.192 --> 13:17.261
The whole town
was due to arrive.

13:17.294 --> 13:19.931
I had to cancel
the whole damn ceremony!

13:19.965 --> 13:22.500
No, I couldn't
even start the thing.

13:22.533 --> 13:27.139
There was going to be a
fireworks show, for God's sake!

13:27.172 --> 13:29.007
What do you think?

13:29.039 --> 13:32.577
Look at those
Halloween costumes!

-Kind of itchy.
-You're gonna look great tomorrow.

You are a wonderful
Abraham Lincoln.

13:42.220 --> 13:45.290

of Bette Davis.

13:45.322 --> 13:47.326
Greta garbo!

13:49.894 --> 13:51.963
This...

13:54.164 --> 13:57.403
You'll fix it. You always do.
You'll make it better.

13:59.236 --> 14:02.307
I don't deserve you.

14:02.340 --> 14:04.877
You're the most
beautiful girl in town.

14:04.909 --> 14:06.978

They're coming right toward us!

20:01.031 --> 20:04.669
It's the end of the world!
We're all gonna die!

20:06.804 --> 20:08.673
Mom, we're leaving.
I packed your suitcase.

20:08.705 --> 20:10.442
Dad's outside.
Come on!

20:58.388 --> 21:00.557
I couldn't reach
my daughter in Boston.

21:00.590 --> 21:02.394
They must have wiped out Boston!

21:02.426 --> 21:03.961
Hey might have wiped out
the whole damn country!

21:03.994 --> 21:05.796
Of course they're coming for us.

21:05.829 --> 21:08.799
We've got the fourth tallest
water tower in three counties.

21:11.969 --> 21:13.571
All right, hold on!

21:13.604 --> 21:15.840
The radio said that they landed
in Grover's Mill.

21:15.873 --> 21:17.776
That's only a few hours
from here, isn't it?

21:17.808 --> 21:19.510
When sheriff dandy gets here

21:19.544 --> 21:22.447
he will have definitive
answers, I promise.

21:22.480 --> 21:26.384
Can anybody tell me
what the fuck is going on?

21:26.416 --> 21:28.319
Okay.

21:34.025 --> 21:35.661
Everybody finished?

21:39.029 --> 21:41.066
Finished screaming and yelling?

21:44.701 --> 21:47.538
You wanna act like
a bunch of goddamn fools?

21:47.571 --> 21:51.075
Well, that'll make it
nice and easy for them

21:51.108 --> 21:53.077
when they get here,
won't it?

21:53.111 --> 21:56.715
You'll be standing around
with your tits in the wind

21:56.748 --> 21:59.384
and those bastards
will float on over

21:59.416 --> 22:02.453
burn you alive,
right where you're standing.

22:02.487 --> 22:05.390
You'll be dead.

22:05.423 --> 22:06.790
Then you'll be dead!

22:06.824 --> 22:07.826
Then you!

22:07.858 --> 22:09.961
Is that what you want?

22:09.993 --> 22:12.730
You're a crazy old man, Collins.

22:12.763 --> 22:17.368
Crazy?
Crazy world, shorty.

22:17.402 --> 22:20.971
Believe you me,
I've seen it.

22:21.005 --> 22:24.542
I've seen things
make you shit a green carrot.

22:24.575 --> 22:27.144
Wanna get in your cars
and die on the road,

22:27.178 --> 22:29.614
hide under a rug
and die like an animal?

22:29.646 --> 22:31.548
Go right ahead.

22:31.582 --> 22:33.951
Seems like a fitting end
to this town.

22:33.984 --> 22:37.855
You've all been dead for years,
you just never knew it.

22:39.624 --> 22:43.795
I'm gonna fight those bastards
when they come.

22:43.827 --> 22:48.566
Martian fire rays
don't scare me.

22:48.598 --> 22:53.105
Giving up,
that's what scares me.

22:54.439 --> 22:56.908
Hem and haw here
all you want.

22:56.941 --> 22:59.744
Every minute they get closer.

22:59.777 --> 23:04.149
Or follow me.

23:04.182 --> 23:08.019
Up to you.

23:08.051 --> 23:10.788
Thank you.

23:10.821 --> 23:13.891
Well, Mr. Collins has weighed in

23:13.924 --> 23:15.960
with his proposal,
and...

23:15.992 --> 23:17.828
someone's finally
making some damn sense.

23:17.862 --> 23:20.098
Get anything that can
be used as a weapon.

23:20.131 --> 23:21.699
We need supplies.

23:21.731 --> 23:23.835
I'll send word
about a base camp.

23:23.867 --> 23:25.403
Move out!

23:26.770 --> 23:29.072
They landed
in Grover's Mill at 8:50,

23:29.105 --> 23:31.142
Basking Ridge,
around 9:00.

23:31.174 --> 23:35.680
With that rate of speed, I'd say we
gotta be ready for them at 04:30.

23:35.712 --> 23:37.581
That's roughly
five hours from now.

23:37.615 --> 23:38.950
-Make sense?
-Yeah.

23:38.982 --> 23:41.219
How are we supposed
to be ready for this?

23:41.251 --> 23:43.454
We'll burn that bridge
when we get to it.

23:43.488 --> 23:45.923
We need to find a clearing
to anchor our defense,

23:45.957 --> 23:47.992
set up some work lights,
a road block

23:48.025 --> 23:49.461
to slow them down.

23:49.493 --> 23:51.962
Ignite some spot fires,
a barricade.

23:51.996 --> 23:54.632
Make it look like
all hell broke loose,

23:54.664 --> 23:57.234
and pray till the boys stationed
at fort dix arrive.

23:57.268 --> 24:00.038
-The boys of fort... wait, with the army?
-No, Clark, the girl scouts.

24:00.070 --> 24:03.907
Pulled the same maneuver
with the 93rd infantry in '18.

24:03.941 --> 24:07.178
Knocked a shit load of krauts
right out of their lederhosen.

24:07.211 --> 24:09.780
Wait a minute.
Whose property is this?

24:09.814 --> 24:11.649
That's widow Johnson's place.

24:11.682 --> 24:13.551
Not anymore.

24:26.897 --> 24:29.701
Helen, what are you
doing here?

24:29.733 --> 24:30.868
Where's Stan?

24:30.902 --> 24:32.604
In the shed.

24:32.636 --> 24:33.971
Behind the house.

24:34.005 --> 24:36.508
Hiding under
a sack of grain.

24:37.741 --> 24:40.110
Why is this happening?

24:40.144 --> 24:41.778
I don't know. I...

24:41.811 --> 24:44.147
The Bible says nothing
of life on Mars, does it?

24:44.181 --> 24:45.583
I... I don't know.

24:45.615 --> 24:47.951
Is God sending
the martians to kill us?

24:47.984 --> 24:50.954
Are they coming
because God told them to?

24:50.988 --> 24:52.856
If God loves us,
why would he do...

24:52.890 --> 24:54.626
Well, maybe God
doesn't love us.

24:54.659 --> 24:57.528
Maybe God is just a mean,
cruel son of a bitch.

24:57.561 --> 25:00.197
I have no goddamn answers!
You get it?

25:00.230 --> 25:03.034
I have no answers.

25:03.067 --> 25:04.635
What the hell
do you want from me?

25:06.871 --> 25:08.573
Your help.

25:13.877 --> 25:16.247
And this is what I get.

25:35.266 --> 25:37.168
You all right, Lorraine?

25:41.972 --> 25:43.974
Hey, Lorraine, the thing is,
we need everyone's help,

25:44.008 --> 25:45.710
so could you tell Paul
that we're gonna set up...

25:45.742 --> 25:47.011
Paul?

25:49.913 --> 25:51.048
Yeah, yeah, where is he?

25:51.082 --> 25:52.784
We need him
to find the...

25:52.817 --> 25:56.320
Paul's here.
He's inside.

25:56.354 --> 26:00.792
Okay. here's the plan,
we're gonna set up base camp

26:00.825 --> 26:02.192
at Widow Johnson's place,
all right?

26:02.226 --> 26:03.695
And the kids are gonna...

26:03.728 --> 26:05.163
The kids are gonna
go to the school house.

26:05.195 --> 26:06.964
They boarded it up,
so it's a pretty safe spot.

26:06.998 --> 26:08.933
Please turn around.

26:10.367 --> 26:14.304
Please walk away.

26:14.337 --> 26:16.575
Please leave me alone.

26:18.909 --> 26:21.212
I don't know if
you've heard, Lorraine,

26:21.244 --> 26:23.914
but there's martians...

26:23.948 --> 26:25.917
I don't care!

26:25.950 --> 26:27.818
Now get out of here!

26:49.673 --> 26:51.076
Mom?

26:52.442 --> 26:53.811
Mom?

26:54.811 --> 26:56.246
Mom!

26:57.882 --> 26:59.718
Mom, are you okay?

27:01.117 --> 27:02.820
What are we gonna do?

28:01.045 --> 28:03.815
No, no,
it's Lorraine davison.

28:07.084 --> 28:10.087
Get them in here.
We've been waiting for you.

28:10.121 --> 28:11.989
Don't leave us here, please.

28:12.021 --> 28:14.858
Honey, I need you
to be brave for me, okay?

28:14.892 --> 28:16.227
I'm scared, mama.

28:16.259 --> 28:19.931
You'll be safe here,
I promise.

28:19.963 --> 28:21.765
I mean,
I'm scared for you.

29:09.445 --> 29:12.282
-Move, move, move.
-Thank you for coming.

29:12.316 --> 29:13.518
All right.

29:13.550 --> 29:15.318
All right, big load,
folks, come on!

29:15.352 --> 29:18.389
Don't give me any
half-ass half-assedness.

29:21.325 --> 29:22.426
Look sharp.

29:22.459 --> 29:24.262
-Here they come.
-That way.

29:24.295 --> 29:27.498
Time is not our friend here,
understand?

29:27.530 --> 29:29.900
Find something to do
and do it!

29:36.906 --> 29:40.177
It's early. Do you see
anything out there?

29:40.211 --> 29:42.212
Let's go folks, right over here
ahead of the hill...

29:42.246 --> 29:43.881
Watch out! Watch out!
Watch out!

29:43.913 --> 29:46.983
Right over there.
Let's go, let's got, let's go!

29:47.017 --> 29:48.853
That's it.
Right over there.

29:57.361 --> 29:58.963
All right.

29:58.996 --> 30:00.163
Good.

30:00.196 --> 30:04.367
Lay down that cornfield
by summit road.

30:04.401 --> 30:07.071
Get 'em to our eyes
in the observation post.

30:07.104 --> 30:09.007
Tell him to keep
'em field north.

30:11.275 --> 30:12.476
What the hell is this?

30:12.509 --> 30:15.378
Don't know.
It was in the pile.

30:15.412 --> 30:17.981
Who the hell brought this?

30:21.384 --> 30:23.188
I did.

30:24.320 --> 30:27.324
It came to a point
at the top

30:27.357 --> 30:30.493
and I thought
it might be useful.

30:30.527 --> 30:32.963
I'm sorry,
I got nervous

30:32.997 --> 30:34.599
and I just grabbed
what I could.

30:36.232 --> 30:38.101
You all find something funny,

30:38.134 --> 30:39.470
goddamn it?

30:39.502 --> 30:42.173
Think it's a time
for souvenirs?

30:42.205 --> 30:45.275
This is life or death.

30:46.509 --> 30:48.445
Now look sharp.
Look sharp.

30:48.479 --> 30:50.280
-Look sharp!
-Look sharp!

30:50.314 --> 30:52.450
Look sharp!
Look sharp!

30:52.482 --> 30:56.220
-Look sharp!
-Shut the hell up.

30:56.252 --> 31:02.259
And you, I expect better
from you tonight, mayor.

31:03.626 --> 31:06.998
From all of you.
Understood?

31:09.666 --> 31:12.236
Now get to work.

31:14.238 --> 31:15.907
You heard him, come on!

31:15.940 --> 31:17.575
Somebody help
these ladies here.

31:17.607 --> 31:21.345
I can't move all this myself.

31:21.377 --> 31:23.947
Come on,
you heard the man!

31:25.082 --> 31:27.118
Okay, I got that.

31:27.151 --> 31:29.620
Let's go. Let's go.

31:29.653 --> 31:31.956
Peg, here you are.

31:34.057 --> 31:35.259
What are you doing?

31:35.291 --> 31:36.961
Helping out.
Captain Collins said

31:36.993 --> 31:39.262
the barricade's the first
defensive obstruction.

31:39.296 --> 31:43.668
But the ladies are organizing
tools and preparing food.

31:43.701 --> 31:47.137
I know, but they need
more hands over here.

31:47.171 --> 31:48.306
Where have you been?

31:48.338 --> 31:50.307
We should head to the ocean.

31:50.340 --> 31:52.342
We'll be safer there.
So come on, let's go!

31:52.375 --> 31:54.412
Chardy! there's a
lot of work to do.

31:54.444 --> 31:57.548
Stay and fight?
That's insane.

31:57.580 --> 32:02.452
This is our home.
We can't just leave.

32:02.486 --> 32:03.653
Peg, please.

32:03.686 --> 32:06.656
Edwards, leave the girl alone.

32:06.690 --> 32:10.361
Sparky, close your trap.
I'll come over there, and...

32:10.394 --> 32:13.730
-And what?
-And close it for you with these two fellas.

32:13.763 --> 32:16.500
-Right here.
-Okay, everybody simmer down.

32:19.536 --> 32:21.339
I'm staying.

32:24.240 --> 32:26.076
Well...

32:27.611 --> 32:28.713
Fine.

32:28.746 --> 32:31.482
Then I'm staying, too.

32:31.515 --> 32:33.417
Good.

32:33.450 --> 32:35.553
I'm glad.

32:35.586 --> 32:37.188
I'm glad, too.

32:44.394 --> 32:50.999
You're my fiancée, now.
Don't forget.

32:51.034 --> 32:51.502
I won't.

33:01.377 --> 33:03.513
Jimmy... Jimmy, what did
he have on the farm?

33:03.547 --> 33:05.548
I don't wanna play
your stupid game.

33:05.582 --> 33:07.351
We're all gonna burn alive!

33:07.384 --> 33:09.753
Come on, you two!
And you over there,

33:09.787 --> 33:12.023
get over here. Let's go!

33:16.527 --> 33:17.694
Hello.

33:20.196 --> 33:23.199
Hello.
I didn't see you there.

33:23.232 --> 33:27.137
Clark, earlier tonight
on the porch

33:27.171 --> 33:28.471
when I raised my voice...

33:28.505 --> 33:30.341
And threw a plant at my head.

33:30.374 --> 33:32.476
Yes, well...

33:32.509 --> 33:34.511
That behavior
is not like me.

33:34.545 --> 33:37.681
It was inappropriate
and I apologize.

33:37.713 --> 33:39.282
There's no need to.

33:39.316 --> 33:41.117
It was heat of the moment.

33:41.151 --> 33:42.452
Right.

33:43.519 --> 33:45.789
Paul's gone.

33:45.823 --> 33:47.758
To answer your question...

33:47.790 --> 33:49.659
-Yeah.
-from before.

33:49.692 --> 33:52.629
He drove off without us.
I don't think he's coming back.

33:55.199 --> 33:59.202
Well, then, I'm sure there's
some kind of explanation.

34:00.503 --> 34:01.772
There is.

34:07.510 --> 34:13.150
"Dearest Paul, however long
it takes, we'll wait for you.

34:13.181 --> 34:14.385
Margaret."
who's Margaret?

34:14.418 --> 34:15.686
I don't know.

34:18.188 --> 34:20.724
"Yours," is certainly
troublesome.

34:20.757 --> 34:23.561
How about "however long
it takes I'll wait for you"?

34:23.594 --> 34:25.762
What the hell
does that mean?

34:25.795 --> 34:29.532
I think it means
whatever the time frame,

34:29.565 --> 34:31.701
she'll be waiting for...

34:31.735 --> 34:34.338
-Well, yes!
-Yeah, yeah.

34:34.371 --> 34:37.407
The fact is it can mean a bunch
of different things, really.

34:37.440 --> 34:41.610
Or it could mean that sometimes
you think you know someone

34:41.643 --> 34:43.413
but the truth is,
you really don't.

34:49.652 --> 34:51.755
I'm sorry to bother you.

34:54.791 --> 34:56.260
Hey, Lorraine?

34:57.827 --> 35:01.565
I... I could use
some help here

35:01.597 --> 35:03.366
if you wanted
to give me a hand,

35:03.400 --> 35:04.869
with...

35:04.902 --> 35:07.338
-Okay.
-I have no idea.

35:07.371 --> 35:09.340
They gave me a...
They told me quickly

35:09.373 --> 35:10.574
and I got confused.

35:10.606 --> 35:13.610
There's... I thought
there was a...

35:45.474 --> 35:48.179
Word is they took over
widow Johnson's place.

35:48.211 --> 35:52.483
And get this,
old man Collins is in charge.

35:52.516 --> 35:54.218
Jeez Louise.

35:59.523 --> 36:01.925
Excuse me.

36:01.958 --> 36:03.826
Ziggy's gotta
go to the bathroom.

36:03.860 --> 36:07.398
Yeah, there's a bucket
in the corner for that.

36:07.431 --> 36:09.699
Thing is he's gotta
go number two,

36:09.733 --> 36:11.435
and believe me,
when he goes number two

36:11.467 --> 36:13.170
it's like a number four.

36:22.945 --> 36:24.981
Where did you?
You stole this?

36:25.014 --> 36:26.884
From in there?

36:28.552 --> 36:32.423
Good thinking.
Come on, let's go find mom.

36:42.733 --> 36:44.402
Hello.

36:48.605 --> 36:50.541
Cigarette, Peg?

36:50.574 --> 36:52.409
I don't smoke.

36:54.878 --> 36:57.615
Well, tonight's
the night to start.

36:59.382 --> 37:01.685
No, I think those things
are dangerous.

37:08.492 --> 37:10.561
It could be your last pack.

37:11.961 --> 37:15.632
Are you sure
you wanna give it away?

37:15.666 --> 37:17.835
There's plenty more
where that came from.

37:19.568 --> 37:20.971
I bet.

37:22.873 --> 37:26.510
Lord...

37:26.543 --> 37:29.445
It's been a long time
since I've asked

37:29.478 --> 37:32.750
anything of you.
Long time.

37:32.782 --> 37:36.286
You listening?

37:36.320 --> 37:37.989
How about
you give me a sign?

37:39.623 --> 37:41.826
Any kind of sign.

37:47.030 --> 37:50.768
Do... do crickets...
Is that... is that the sign?

37:50.800 --> 37:52.402
The crickets?

37:53.704 --> 37:56.606
All right, all right...

37:56.639 --> 38:00.710
Just...
just give me a sign

38:00.744 --> 38:02.946
if the crickets
are the sign.

38:02.978 --> 38:05.481
No?
okay!

38:05.514 --> 38:06.951
All right, then I'm done
with you, too.

38:09.385 --> 38:11.054
You... you...

38:12.521 --> 38:13.857
Yeah?

38:14.990 --> 38:16.559
God!

38:24.400 --> 38:26.503
God!

38:49.425 --> 38:53.963
"A cloud, and as the doves
to their windows.

38:53.996 --> 38:55.632
Out of weakness
were made strong,

38:55.664 --> 38:56.933
waxed Valiant in fight,

38:56.967 --> 39:00.070
turned to flight
the armies of the aliens."

39:02.539 --> 39:05.075
Helen, it's ray!

39:05.108 --> 39:06.744
Go away, reverend!

39:06.777 --> 39:08.644
Helen, listen to me
very carefully.

39:08.677 --> 39:10.614
It all makes
perfect sense now.

39:10.646 --> 39:13.717
Yes! Yes! They're coming
because God told them to.

39:13.750 --> 39:15.885
But, no, it is not
to kill us.

39:15.918 --> 39:18.422
It's... it's to save us.

39:44.079 --> 39:46.682
Stan, reverend ray is here.

39:46.715 --> 39:49.420
I ain't gonna go out there
and get killed by them things,

39:49.452 --> 39:51.588
and I'll stop anyone
who try to make me!

39:51.621 --> 39:54.157
Honey, listen to what
reverend ray has to say.

39:54.190 --> 39:55.826
Listen nothing!

39:55.858 --> 39:57.894
Get out of here!
Move! Get out of here!

39:57.927 --> 40:00.830
No, no, you can lie here, Stan,
under that sack of grain,

40:00.864 --> 40:03.132
your heart filled with nothing
but doubt and fear.

40:03.166 --> 40:05.501
It's all in here, Stan,
the invasion.

40:05.534 --> 40:07.603
-Everything.
-no, not true!

40:07.637 --> 40:08.972
Not true.

40:09.005 --> 40:10.907
Do you remember
what you told me this morning?

40:10.940 --> 40:13.176
Not really, that was like
10 hours ago.

40:13.210 --> 40:15.612
And a whole lotta shit's
gone down since then.

40:15.644 --> 40:19.817
You said they're plans for peace
and not for disaster.

40:19.849 --> 40:22.685
To give you a future
and a hope.

40:22.719 --> 40:24.521
And that's what tonight is.

40:24.554 --> 40:27.791
-His plan.
-He's right, Stan.

40:27.824 --> 40:28.858
Howdy, Stan.

40:28.891 --> 40:29.893
Looking good, Stan.

40:29.925 --> 40:31.594
Stop saying my name!

40:31.628 --> 40:32.996
I know what
you're trying to do!

40:33.028 --> 40:35.666
It's all true, Stan,
if you join us,

40:35.699 --> 40:38.936
you will not die tonight,
I promise you this.

40:38.969 --> 40:42.072
And I promise you this,
if you don't come...

40:44.974 --> 40:46.710
I'll stay, too.

40:56.952 --> 41:00.690
Take... take
these things off me.

41:00.724 --> 41:02.759
Remove the grain?

41:02.791 --> 41:05.194
-Remove the grain.
-Remove the grain.

41:05.228 --> 41:06.697
-Remove the grain!
-Yep.

41:33.088 --> 41:34.692
Ziggy?

41:37.760 --> 41:38.929
Ziggy?

41:42.231 --> 41:44.034
What the hell are you doing?

41:44.067 --> 41:45.869
You can't just run away
from me like that!

41:45.902 --> 41:47.605
What's wrong with you?

41:49.873 --> 41:51.942
Is that ice-cream?

41:51.974 --> 41:52.976
I want some.

41:54.077 --> 41:56.780
Who's there?

41:56.813 --> 41:58.548
Is someone there?

41:59.349 --> 42:02.586
Ann davison and Ziggy.

42:02.619 --> 42:06.023
There's poison gas
floating in the air.

42:06.056 --> 42:07.824
It's coming from the north.

42:07.856 --> 42:09.759
There's what?

42:09.793 --> 42:11.896
Poison gas coming
from the north.

42:13.862 --> 42:15.598
No, they're already dead.

42:15.632 --> 42:17.867
-Hello?
-no! we're still here.

42:17.900 --> 42:19.969
Get wet rags and towels.

42:20.003 --> 42:23.941
Wrap them around your nose
and your mouth, okay?

42:23.974 --> 42:25.175
Good luck.

42:29.980 --> 42:31.615
What is he talking about?

42:45.929 --> 42:47.565
Poison gas?

42:49.132 --> 42:51.201
Peg!

42:51.233 --> 42:52.635
Anybody seen Peg?

42:52.668 --> 42:54.203
Peg Prickett,
you guys seen Peg?

42:54.237 --> 42:55.271
No.

42:57.039 --> 42:59.675
What's that?
Here, I'll buy it.

42:59.708 --> 43:01.611
Ring me up for this.

43:01.644 --> 43:03.246
Now get over...
Get that next one...

43:03.278 --> 43:05.248
Get that next one
over there, too.

43:05.280 --> 43:07.650
Peg!

43:07.684 --> 43:09.820
Can I interest either of you
in a blanket?

43:09.853 --> 43:12.055
It's getting nippy out here.

43:12.088 --> 43:16.393
Did good on that fire, Tom.
It's working.

43:16.425 --> 43:18.628
All right, would you gentlemen
like a blanket?

43:44.987 --> 43:46.856
There you go.
Enjoy.

43:49.425 --> 43:51.828
Okay, here you are, sir.

43:53.697 --> 43:56.400
Hey, sparky.

43:56.432 --> 43:58.001
All right.

43:59.001 --> 44:00.770
There you go.

44:01.971 --> 44:03.206
More.

44:05.375 --> 44:07.143
Okay.

44:13.248 --> 44:15.018
All right.

44:18.954 --> 44:20.324
Enjoy.

44:23.159 --> 44:27.463
All right, hello.

44:27.496 --> 44:29.765
-Top drawer stew, Clark.
-Thank you.

44:29.798 --> 44:32.469
I think you missed
your calling.

44:32.501 --> 44:33.869
Do you want the rest of mine?

44:33.902 --> 44:35.838
No, I'm fine.
I had my fill.

44:35.871 --> 44:39.175
-Thank you very much.
-I saw you, you didn't get any.

44:39.208 --> 44:43.012
It was fine.
Here's something. Okay?

44:43.045 --> 44:45.347
Delicious.

44:45.380 --> 44:47.783
Clark's famous notebook.

44:47.817 --> 44:50.152
Famous.

44:50.186 --> 44:53.923
No, it's just a to-do list
and stuff I gotta get done.

44:53.956 --> 44:55.157
Other stuff.

44:55.190 --> 44:57.993
Like paint
the rotolactor sign.

44:58.027 --> 45:00.429
Don't you mean, "chosen as?"

45:00.463 --> 45:02.165
Yeah, I changed it.

45:02.197 --> 45:03.466
You know what you should put?

45:03.500 --> 45:06.737
"Dairy-go-round.
it will work eventually."

45:10.172 --> 45:13.009
"Not milking cows
since 1930."

45:20.884 --> 45:22.818
Hey, what's that?
It looks like a poem

45:22.851 --> 45:27.324
no, it's a poem,
no, no, it's nothing.

45:27.356 --> 45:29.992
I'm sorry. I've... I have...
I got a lot on my mind.

45:30.025 --> 45:31.427
And we're behind schedule
and I don't wanna waste time

45:31.460 --> 45:33.829
talking about this
kinda stuff, sorry.

45:33.862 --> 45:36.398
You see.
It is something.

45:36.431 --> 45:37.767
-No, it's not.
-Yes, it is.

45:37.800 --> 45:38.835
-Come on.
-No.

45:38.867 --> 45:40.436
Come on.
What is it?

45:40.469 --> 45:41.504
-Nothing.
-I don't know what's the big deal.

45:41.538 --> 45:44.074
They're songs! Okay?

45:45.541 --> 45:47.210
It's songs.

45:49.478 --> 45:53.082
Songs you wrote?

45:53.115 --> 45:54.384
Yeah.

45:54.416 --> 45:57.186
Yeah, it's songs
I wrote, yeah.

45:57.219 --> 46:00.956
Well, you see,
that wasn't so hard, was it?

46:00.989 --> 46:03.826
I'm just trying to get
to know you better, Clark.

46:03.860 --> 46:05.061
-I appreciate that.
-And forget the stew,

46:05.094 --> 46:07.429
maybe troubadour's
your calling.

46:07.463 --> 46:08.465
Okay.

46:08.498 --> 46:11.034
Can I hear one?

46:11.067 --> 46:12.469
Well, what do you want...
What do you want me

46:12.501 --> 46:14.070
to break out
into song right here?

46:14.103 --> 46:16.239
Well, if not now, when?

46:16.271 --> 46:18.875
Hey! how about this?
You sing one of your songs...

46:18.907 --> 46:20.342
No, how about this...
You don't ask me about my songs,

46:20.376 --> 46:21.845
and I don't ask why
you've been with a man

46:21.878 --> 46:23.447
who ran off
to another woman tonight.

46:33.255 --> 46:34.891
No, you're right.

46:34.923 --> 46:36.326
It's none of my business.

46:36.358 --> 46:39.895
Here, I'm sure
that's on your list.

46:39.929 --> 46:41.365
Get the bowls back.

46:43.932 --> 46:46.836
-Hey, Lorraine, wait.
-I'm going to get the kids, so leave me alone.

46:46.869 --> 46:48.137
Lorraine, I didn't mean to say that.
I'm sorry.

46:48.170 --> 46:50.172
I'm sorry, too.
I thought we were friends.

46:50.206 --> 46:52.876
-We are friends.
-Well, then, why would you say that to me?

46:57.045 --> 46:59.081
I'm going to get
Ann and Ziggy.

46:59.114 --> 47:02.251
If you're coming, fine, if not,
I'll see you when I see you.

47:14.630 --> 47:17.366
Peg, I need a word with you.

47:17.400 --> 47:19.635
I'm eating, Chardy,
you're gonna have to wait.

47:19.668 --> 47:24.440
No, I think this is more
important than you eating.

47:24.474 --> 47:26.510
Please, follow me.

47:33.983 --> 47:35.652
What clothes are those?

47:35.684 --> 47:37.653
I'm...

47:37.686 --> 47:41.391
Peg, I've been doing
a lot of thinking about us

47:41.423 --> 47:43.460
and I'm sure
you have as well

47:43.492 --> 47:48.599
and, the thing is,
this might be our last...

47:50.967 --> 47:52.535
This could be it for us...

47:52.568 --> 47:53.570
Tonight.

47:53.603 --> 47:56.405
You know, life-wise.

47:56.438 --> 47:58.007
Therefore I'm gonna
get right to it.

47:58.041 --> 48:01.010
I think
we oughta get married.

48:03.313 --> 48:05.581
-Tonight?
-right now.

48:05.614 --> 48:07.317
The sooner, the better.
That way when these things...

48:07.349 --> 48:09.351
They fly over the hill,
and then if they fry us

48:09.385 --> 48:12.155
we'll be fried together,
as husband and wife,

48:12.188 --> 48:13.690
you and me,
just like we planned.

48:13.722 --> 48:16.558
Chardy, something's
going on tonight

48:16.592 --> 48:20.297
that's bigger
than you and me.

48:20.329 --> 48:22.965
-You understand?
-I understand that since you whacked your head

48:22.998 --> 48:24.533
you've been acting
like a lunatic,

48:24.567 --> 48:27.938
and you better stop,
right friggin' now.

48:27.971 --> 48:30.106
We've had some
good times together.

48:30.139 --> 48:31.608
We sure have.

48:31.641 --> 48:34.543
The potato sack races
at yokum pond.

48:34.577 --> 48:38.248
And that time we rescued
that raccoon that time.

48:38.280 --> 48:40.918
It's time that we go
our separate ways.

48:44.086 --> 48:45.588
I'm sorry.

48:48.623 --> 48:51.260
No, no, no, no.

48:51.293 --> 48:53.028
You're gonna do what I say
because that's the way

48:53.061 --> 48:54.463
that it's supposed to be,
so we're gonna get married.

48:54.496 --> 48:56.032
Let go.

49:01.570 --> 49:04.674
I saw you with sparky.

49:06.376 --> 49:09.546
You were fooling around.

49:09.579 --> 49:11.381
Why would you do that?

49:15.518 --> 49:18.021
Because I wanted to.

49:18.054 --> 49:19.356
Why?

49:21.556 --> 49:23.659
Because I had to.

49:27.797 --> 49:30.632
All I ever did was open
my heart for you

49:30.666 --> 49:33.036
so wide that you could
crawl right in.

49:33.068 --> 49:34.403
I will do anything for you.

49:34.436 --> 49:36.373
I will... I will... I will...

49:36.405 --> 49:39.675
I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll
I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll

49:39.708 --> 49:41.210
I'll... I'll... I'll!

50:05.268 --> 50:09.072
Darkness.
darkness.

50:09.105 --> 50:13.175
Darkness, we have been
living in darkness.

50:13.208 --> 50:15.244
But the light has been
right in front of me

50:15.277 --> 50:17.179
just waiting to shine.

50:17.213 --> 50:19.649
The clouds have been
lifted from my eyes.

50:19.681 --> 50:22.117
They hovered and dashed,
zigzagged and darted

50:22.150 --> 50:24.420
-across the heavens above.
-Sing it, reverend!

50:24.454 --> 50:28.525
My eyes have opened,
and all I see is truth.

50:28.557 --> 50:31.427
Beautiful, glorious,
truthful truth.

50:31.460 --> 50:32.728
Can you see the truth,
brother?

50:32.762 --> 50:35.231
Yes! yes! I see it!
I see it. Amen, brother.

50:35.264 --> 50:37.133
Yes, amen!

50:37.166 --> 50:39.536
Tonight is not the end.

50:39.568 --> 50:42.137
No, no, no, no, no, no!

50:42.170 --> 50:43.739
Tonight is just the beginning.

50:43.773 --> 50:48.178
We are not in the path
of destruction.

50:51.780 --> 50:55.317
-Yes, we are!
-God's kingdom's coming to Earth.

50:55.351 --> 50:58.320
God's messengers
are on their way.

50:58.353 --> 51:02.357
God's army is somewhere
in central New Jersey

51:02.391 --> 51:05.161
and we will be the first
to welcome them

51:05.193 --> 51:07.630
when they get here!

51:44.333 --> 51:46.436
Stay put, Ziggy.
I mean it.

52:28.344 --> 52:30.246
-I didn't mean to...
-Didn't mean to what?

52:30.278 --> 52:31.581
I was just trying to find out...

52:31.614 --> 52:33.349
Find out what?
Nothing to find out here.

52:33.382 --> 52:35.717
There are no martians.

52:35.751 --> 52:38.421
What did you say?

52:38.454 --> 52:43.927
I don't think
there are any martians coming.

52:45.927 --> 52:48.197
Why not?

52:48.231 --> 52:51.835
Well, I haven't seen
any spaceships.

52:53.402 --> 52:56.438
Don't smell any poisonous gas
or anything.

52:58.407 --> 53:01.311
Radio's not reporting anything
else about the invasions,

53:01.344 --> 53:02.579
so...

53:05.614 --> 53:08.250
There are no martians.

53:08.284 --> 53:09.786
At all.

53:11.987 --> 53:13.789
Are there?

53:23.632 --> 53:25.768
None that I'm aware of.

53:27.503 --> 53:29.271
Holy shit.

53:32.608 --> 53:35.245
But what happens when everybody
finds out the truth?

53:35.277 --> 53:37.480
Everybody thinks
they're gonna die.

53:37.512 --> 53:40.449
That ain't a bad thing, is it?

53:40.483 --> 53:43.586
In fact, might be
a good thing.

53:43.619 --> 53:45.321
Know what I mean?

53:45.353 --> 53:46.822
Guess so.

53:46.856 --> 53:50.860
You're too young
to understand.

53:50.893 --> 53:54.396
One day you will,

53:54.429 --> 53:56.966
when you're closer to the end
than the beginning.

54:12.614 --> 54:16.418
Yep, still fits.

54:18.054 --> 54:21.324
I knew it would.

54:21.356 --> 54:23.492
So what are we
supposed to do now?

54:23.525 --> 54:26.728
Imagine you got
one night to live.

54:26.762 --> 54:29.632
One night to do
whatever's inside you.

54:29.664 --> 54:30.699
What would you do?

54:30.733 --> 54:32.969
I know what I would do.

54:36.771 --> 54:39.574
Now get the hell
outta here!

54:39.608 --> 54:41.344
Look at this place.

54:41.376 --> 54:42.878
What a mess.

55:00.396 --> 55:02.398
Clark, you don't have
to do that.

55:02.431 --> 55:04.833
No, I want to.

55:06.001 --> 55:07.804
You love it here,
don't you?

55:07.836 --> 55:09.706
I've never been
anywhere else.

55:09.739 --> 55:12.442
No, I take that back.

55:12.474 --> 55:14.876
I went to Princeton once.

55:14.909 --> 55:16.678
Big trip to the big city.

55:16.711 --> 55:18.514
Princeton's not a big city.

55:18.547 --> 55:20.817
Manhattan,
now that's a big city.

55:20.849 --> 55:26.021
Yeah. I've seen
pictures of that place.

55:26.054 --> 55:27.623
You know, I went there
a few months ago.

55:27.655 --> 55:28.891
-You did?
-Yeah.

55:28.923 --> 55:30.626
Really?

55:30.659 --> 55:33.663
-I left early to run some errands.
-Yeah?

55:33.695 --> 55:36.766
I don't know why
I just kept on going,

55:36.798 --> 55:38.867
like something
was pulling me along.

55:38.900 --> 55:40.936
I spent the whole
day walking.

55:40.969 --> 55:43.839
I must have walked down
every street in Manhattan.

55:43.873 --> 55:46.608
-I didn't wanna leave.
-Yeah, I bet.

55:46.641 --> 55:48.076
Clark!

55:48.110 --> 55:49.445
Wh... wh... wh...
What? What? What?

55:50.980 --> 55:54.717
Nothing, I...

55:54.750 --> 55:56.820
I thought I saw something.

56:00.155 --> 56:03.992
Hey, wh... wh... what
were you saying?

56:12.134 --> 56:15.170
-When I got back...
-Yeah?

56:15.204 --> 56:20.443
Paul was sitting
in the living room

56:20.476 --> 56:23.880
and I was standing,
staring at him,

56:23.913 --> 56:28.150
waiting for him to ask me
where I've been,

56:28.184 --> 56:31.621
-how my day was, anything.
-Yeah.

56:31.653 --> 56:37.626
And finally he just looked up
and nodded and winked.

56:37.659 --> 56:40.163
He just looked
right through me.

56:45.501 --> 56:47.903
I never told anyone
that before.

56:49.137 --> 56:51.106
That's all right.

56:51.139 --> 56:54.076
I know what that's like.

56:54.108 --> 56:56.913
To have a secret?

56:56.945 --> 56:58.981
To feel invisible.

57:01.983 --> 57:03.853
Hey, we better get going.

57:11.025 --> 57:13.929
No, no,
it's Lorraine again.

57:16.632 --> 57:18.099
I'm here for Ann and Ziggy.

57:18.132 --> 57:19.734
Well, they ain't here.

57:19.768 --> 57:21.670
Where are they?
They were here earlier?

57:21.704 --> 57:22.939
I left them here!

57:22.972 --> 57:25.174
What the heck
was I supposed to do?

57:25.206 --> 57:27.109
The Polish kid
had to poop real bad.

58:09.952 --> 58:12.021
Ziggy?

58:28.804 --> 58:31.106
Okay, let's go.
Move! Move! Move!

58:31.139 --> 58:32.908
Come on, keep it coming.
Come on!

58:32.942 --> 58:34.210
What's going on here?

58:34.242 --> 58:35.744
What's going on?

58:35.777 --> 58:36.913
We're getting ready
is what's going on.

58:39.081 --> 58:40.216
Careful.

58:40.248 --> 58:41.917
Stop! stop!
Stop! Stop!

58:41.951 --> 58:43.753
What did you do?
What the hell is going on?

58:43.786 --> 58:45.320
Collins, look at this.
We're gonna kill ourselves

58:45.353 --> 58:46.688
before they kill us.

58:46.722 --> 58:47.690
Look, I know
you've got a plan,

58:47.722 --> 58:49.190
but we can't win this.

58:49.224 --> 58:51.294
We discussed this.
I told you we'd be ready.

58:51.327 --> 58:53.896
Listen, I know, I know, but we
have no idea what's coming.

58:53.929 --> 58:55.331
We got no idea.

58:55.364 --> 58:58.099
And I said we'd burn
that bridge when we get...

58:58.132 --> 59:00.302
This is the bridge!
This is the bridge!

59:00.335 --> 59:03.705
They'll come, we fight,
history gets made.

59:03.739 --> 59:06.876
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
-Mr. Mayor!

59:06.909 --> 59:09.778
Stand up or stand down.
It's too late for protest.

59:09.811 --> 59:12.248
I mean, come on, do you
got a better idea, Clark?

59:12.280 --> 59:14.650
Yeah, about two miles up
we can hide.

59:14.682 --> 59:16.786
-And if we hide...
-Hide?

59:16.818 --> 59:19.322
Maybe that's how you
do things, Clark,

59:19.355 --> 59:21.923
hide and hope for the best.

59:21.956 --> 59:25.860
But I look around and all
I see are brave soldiers

59:25.893 --> 59:28.730
willing to lay down
their lives for each other.

59:28.764 --> 59:29.966
Do you think
they wanna hide?

59:29.998 --> 59:32.701
We're not soldiers.
We're farmers.

59:32.735 --> 59:34.737
-We're housewives.
-I'm not a soldier.

59:34.769 --> 59:37.706
-I'm not a soldier.
-No, Mac, you grow corn.

59:37.739 --> 59:39.975
Goddamn it! We've only got a few
minutes until they get here.

59:40.009 --> 59:41.177
We don't have time for this.

59:41.210 --> 59:42.711
I'm trying
to get you more time.

59:42.744 --> 59:44.313
-We need more time!
-Get rid of him!

59:44.346 --> 59:46.748
-Get rid of him!
-Don't you touch him!

59:46.782 --> 59:48.985
-Step aside, woman.
-No!

59:49.018 --> 59:51.220
He gives his whole life
to this town,

59:51.253 --> 59:53.655
and you treat him
like he doesn't exist.

59:53.688 --> 59:57.025
And now you wanna what?
You wanna beat him up?

59:57.059 --> 59:58.327
Why?

59:58.360 --> 01:00:00.695
Because he cares
about this place?

01:00:00.728 --> 01:00:03.832
Because he doesn't want
you all to die?

01:00:03.865 --> 01:00:06.936
You oughta be ashamed
of yourselves.

01:00:06.969 --> 01:00:09.905
I mean, what a bunch
of ignorant

01:00:09.938 --> 01:00:13.843
small town assholes
you've all turned out to be.

01:00:17.146 --> 01:00:19.281
Right?

01:00:19.313 --> 01:00:20.949
Right.

01:00:22.150 --> 01:00:24.085
Take 'em home.

01:00:24.119 --> 01:00:26.055
Come on! Come on!
Think about it.

01:00:27.255 --> 01:00:29.157
Get to your positions.

01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:31.092
-All right, let's go.
-They're right over the horizon.

01:00:31.126 --> 01:00:32.862
Come on, let's go.

01:00:32.894 --> 01:00:35.398
See the thing I don't get,
they probably got heat sensors,

01:00:35.431 --> 01:00:37.932
and if they got heat sensors,

01:00:37.965 --> 01:00:39.868
they're gonna know
there's living things down here.

01:00:39.902 --> 01:00:42.070
And if they do...

01:00:42.103 --> 01:00:44.105
What? I'm just saying that they
will probably be able...

01:00:44.139 --> 01:00:46.041
Shut your mouth.

01:00:46.074 --> 01:00:47.710
Do you see that?

01:01:57.079 --> 01:01:59.347
Should have kept
your mouth shut, Clark,

01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:01.250
like you always do.

01:02:23.505 --> 01:02:27.076
So the letters are for?

01:02:27.108 --> 01:02:28.510
I'm gonna Mark everyone
with charcoal

01:02:28.543 --> 01:02:31.413
to separate us
from the non-believers.

01:02:31.445 --> 01:02:33.148
Helen, you'd be marked
with an "H,"

01:02:33.181 --> 01:02:34.182
Sally would get an "S."

01:02:34.215 --> 01:02:35.784
Hold the phone.

01:02:35.818 --> 01:02:37.386
Stan's "S," too.

01:02:37.418 --> 01:02:41.089
To avoid confusion, Stan,
you'll be marked with an "X."

01:02:41.123 --> 01:02:43.224
"X"? really?

01:02:43.257 --> 01:02:46.461
That's the cross-him-out letter,

01:02:46.494 --> 01:02:49.164
don't worry, Stan,
we'll think of something.

01:02:49.197 --> 01:02:51.134
How about a number?
How about a nine?

01:02:53.268 --> 01:02:58.775
Sure. Nine is beautiful.
Thanks, reverend.

01:03:02.376 --> 01:03:04.012
I got a nine.

01:03:07.081 --> 01:03:09.117
See anything, reverend?

01:03:09.150 --> 01:03:14.856
You bet. I saw a bright orange
light for just a second.

01:03:14.889 --> 01:03:17.492
What do you think
they'll do when they come?

01:03:17.525 --> 01:03:20.395
Well, they'll take us...
Take us away,

01:03:20.429 --> 01:03:24.567
take us to someplace better.

01:03:24.599 --> 01:03:28.237
Say they don't take us.

01:03:28.269 --> 01:03:30.338
Instead of taking us
to a better place,

01:03:30.371 --> 01:03:36.144
they just instead cook
every last one of us.

01:03:36.177 --> 01:03:39.480
I just wanna say this.

01:03:39.514 --> 01:03:43.385
We've been coming to you
a good long time, reverend,

01:03:43.418 --> 01:03:45.054
and it ain't hard to see

01:03:45.086 --> 01:03:46.889
that you're not the man
you used to be.

01:03:49.056 --> 01:03:52.393
And it's a hard thing
when folks want answers

01:03:52.427 --> 01:03:55.331
and maybe you
don't have them.

01:03:55.364 --> 01:03:57.233
Who knows?

01:03:57.266 --> 01:03:59.268
Maybe there
ain't any anyways.

01:04:02.336 --> 01:04:08.143
All I know is that you
helped us tonight, reverend.

01:04:09.945 --> 01:04:13.148
No, it's not me,
it's them out there.

01:04:13.181 --> 01:04:18.920
No. it's not out there.

01:04:18.954 --> 01:04:21.356
Its you, ray.

01:04:21.389 --> 01:04:23.424
You helped us live
without fear tonight.

01:04:23.458 --> 01:04:25.927
You woke up something
inside of us all.

01:04:29.197 --> 01:04:30.298
Thank you.

01:04:38.507 --> 01:04:41.210
You say it was
a bright orange light?

01:04:43.210 --> 01:04:47.349
I saw it, too.
Beautiful.

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:52.488
They'll be here soon.

01:04:56.291 --> 01:04:57.293
Let's go.

01:04:57.326 --> 01:04:59.561
This is it.

01:04:59.594 --> 01:05:01.362
It's 04:30.

01:05:01.396 --> 01:05:04.099
This is what we've
been waiting for.

01:05:04.132 --> 01:05:06.068
Hustle, hustle.

01:05:08.570 --> 01:05:12.041
Stay strong.
Stay focused.

01:05:12.074 --> 01:05:13.342
Hurry up.

01:05:26.054 --> 01:05:28.490
Come on, you bastards.

01:05:48.242 --> 01:05:50.478
What's happening?

01:06:00.188 --> 01:06:01.990
Something's wrong.

01:06:03.759 --> 01:06:05.394
They should
be here already.

01:06:06.594 --> 01:06:08.129
They should be here already!

01:06:08.163 --> 01:06:09.664
Where the hell are they?

01:06:13.802 --> 01:06:19.307
They know. They know
we're waiting for them.

01:06:19.340 --> 01:06:20.708
They know about the ambush.

01:06:20.742 --> 01:06:22.244
They're watching us.

01:06:22.277 --> 01:06:24.445
-Dear God.
-They're getting messages.

01:06:24.478 --> 01:06:27.415
-How?
-signals.

01:06:27.449 --> 01:06:29.518
'Cause there's one
of them among us.

01:06:29.550 --> 01:06:32.186
Jesus Christ,
what is the problem?

01:06:32.219 --> 01:06:33.221
There's a spy.

01:06:33.255 --> 01:06:35.124
There's no goddamn spy.

01:06:35.157 --> 01:06:37.059
I saw something in the woods.

01:06:37.092 --> 01:06:39.094
Something fishy's
going on here.

01:06:39.126 --> 01:06:40.795
We've been waiting here
all night!

01:06:40.829 --> 01:06:43.265
You don't understand the gravity
of the situation, Collins,

01:06:43.297 --> 01:06:46.334
things have taken a change
for the much, much worse.

01:06:46.367 --> 01:06:48.403
-I do understand.
-No, you do not,

01:06:48.436 --> 01:06:51.105
because there is a spy
right here in this town!

01:06:51.139 --> 01:06:52.541
Well, we gotta stop
the signals

01:06:52.574 --> 01:06:56.345
'cause they're still
getting data.

01:06:56.378 --> 01:06:59.314
Let's find that spy
and get some goddamned answers!

01:07:00.614 --> 01:07:03.117
Find that spying
son of a bitch!

01:07:03.150 --> 01:07:07.556
And get him to talk about
his goddamn spying, Peg.

01:07:07.588 --> 01:07:09.224
You've hurt me
for the last time.

01:07:10.425 --> 01:07:12.193
Come on!
Let's find that spy!

01:07:12.226 --> 01:07:14.395
Come on!

01:07:14.429 --> 01:07:16.231
Come back here!

01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:20.235
Get the truck.

01:07:27.641 --> 01:07:29.844
Come outside.

01:07:29.878 --> 01:07:32.481
-Let's get outta here.
-No, not you, Jimmy.

01:07:33.849 --> 01:07:35.384
Just Peter.

01:07:42.324 --> 01:07:44.827
How did you get
past the old lady?

01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:46.862
She's been asleep
for an hour.

01:07:46.894 --> 01:07:51.567
-Where have you been?
-You know, out and about.

01:07:52.666 --> 01:07:54.302
Out and about where?

01:07:54.335 --> 01:07:55.804
You know, you could have been
killed out there.

01:08:15.356 --> 01:08:17.626
If it ain't Mr. president.

01:08:30.171 --> 01:08:31.573
Did you...

01:08:36.545 --> 01:08:37.779
Ziggy!

01:10:02.497 --> 01:10:04.833
I found the spy!

01:10:04.865 --> 01:10:06.935
Yeah, get him!

01:10:06.967 --> 01:10:10.404
Who sent you?
How do we stop them?

01:10:10.438 --> 01:10:12.641
I know you understand me,
now answer me!

01:10:15.710 --> 01:10:17.445
Stay away from him!

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:21.583
Enough!

01:10:21.615 --> 01:10:24.453
That kid ain't
no goddamn spy.

01:10:24.485 --> 01:10:25.653
He's a polack.

01:10:25.686 --> 01:10:28.823
He's a little boy.
Look at him.

01:10:28.856 --> 01:10:31.926
This is what everything's
been leading to?

01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:36.465
Going after some kid
who can't protect himself?

01:10:36.497 --> 01:10:40.601
It's about making the most
of whatever we got left.

01:10:40.635 --> 01:10:43.838
Now when they get here,
I want...

01:10:55.884 --> 01:10:59.354
They're here!
Give it all you got!

01:10:59.386 --> 01:11:00.889
This is our moment!

01:11:00.921 --> 01:11:04.425
Go! go! Go!

01:11:34.889 --> 01:11:37.559
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

01:12:13.895 --> 01:12:15.564
Ma, how?

01:12:16.965 --> 01:12:18.600
Where were you?

01:12:18.632 --> 01:12:20.469
Lorraine!

01:12:20.502 --> 01:12:21.503
Lorraine!

01:12:21.536 --> 01:12:22.971
Wait here.

01:12:52.867 --> 01:12:54.802
Is it...

01:12:58.739 --> 01:13:00.541
I'm gonna jump... I'm gonna jump
ahead if that's all right.

01:13:00.574 --> 01:13:02.510
I'm just gonna
jump ahead, okay?

01:13:25.132 --> 01:13:29.470
Actually, that's my song.

01:13:29.503 --> 01:13:32.640
Do you like it?

01:13:32.673 --> 01:13:35.676
It needs some work.

01:13:35.710 --> 01:13:37.645
I know it does.

01:13:37.679 --> 01:13:39.146
But Lorraine,
there's been something

01:13:39.180 --> 01:13:40.849
I've been wanting to tell you
for a very long time

01:13:40.881 --> 01:13:42.049
but if I don't tell you
right now I'm gonna regret it

01:13:42.082 --> 01:13:43.684
for the rest
of my goddamn life,

01:13:43.717 --> 01:13:45.987
even if that's only
for the next six minutes.

01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:49.490
I can't believe it took this much
craziness to pull this out of me,

01:13:49.524 --> 01:13:51.860
and I'm sorry that the timing
is so inconvenient,

01:13:51.893 --> 01:13:53.994
but I got all
these feelings,

01:13:54.028 --> 01:13:57.565
I got all these feelings
and I'm sick... I am sick

01:13:57.599 --> 01:14:00.202
of keeping them bottled up.
No more!

01:14:00.234 --> 01:14:01.902
Not tonight.

01:14:01.935 --> 01:14:03.604
Not ever again.

01:14:06.006 --> 01:14:09.043
I love you.
I love you.

01:14:10.811 --> 01:14:13.548
And that's all there is to it.

01:14:33.635 --> 01:14:35.637
"I heard the voice
of the lord saying,

01:14:35.670 --> 01:14:37.972
'who shall I send
and who will go for us?'

01:14:38.006 --> 01:14:40.709
then said I,
'here am I, send me.'"

01:14:53.988 --> 01:14:56.992
Where were you?

01:14:57.024 --> 01:14:59.927
I'm so sorry...
I'm so sorry.

01:14:59.961 --> 01:15:01.195
You left us here.

01:15:01.229 --> 01:15:02.864
There's no martians.

01:15:02.896 --> 01:15:05.100
Wait, what do you mean?

01:15:05.132 --> 01:15:09.703
It's a radio broadcast.
There's no martians.

01:15:09.737 --> 01:15:10.771
I don't you
to ever feel like...

01:16:51.805 --> 01:16:53.774
<i>City and town officials
across the eastern seaboard</i>

01:16:53.807 --> 01:16:55.877
<i>reported widespread panic</i>

01:16:55.909 --> 01:16:58.813
<i>due to last night's,
"War of the Worlds" broadcast.</i>

01:16:58.845 --> 01:17:01.248
<i>A representative from the
Columbia Broadcasting System</i>

01:17:01.282 --> 01:17:04.252
<i>says quote, "We sincerely
regret that some listeners</i>

01:17:04.284 --> 01:17:08.822
<i>mistook the program's fantastic
elements for fact," end quote.</i>

01:17:08.855 --> 01:17:11.826
<i>Apparently many citizens
throughout the U.S.,</i>

01:17:11.859 --> 01:17:13.828
<i>particularly in New Jersey,</i>

01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:16.930
<i>believed that they were facing
imminent death.</i>

01:17:16.963 --> 01:17:18.932
<i>Quite a hoax?</i>

01:17:18.966 --> 01:17:22.971
<i>Well, we assure you
you're very much alive.</i>

01:17:42.489 --> 01:17:44.826
Sorry I'm late again,
everybody.

01:18:01.908 --> 01:18:06.346
In this book, it says a great
deal of righteous things

01:18:06.380 --> 01:18:10.150
and has the answer to many
of life's questions.

01:18:10.184 --> 01:18:12.287
But you know what?

01:18:12.319 --> 01:18:14.822
It also says that no man
with crushed testicles

01:18:14.855 --> 01:18:16.490
shall enter the assembly
of the lord,

01:18:16.524 --> 01:18:20.261
so it probably doesn't
have all the answers.

01:18:20.293 --> 01:18:22.363
So what do you say today
we just put the book away

01:18:22.395 --> 01:18:24.765
and we just talk?
Really talk

01:18:24.798 --> 01:18:27.836
about whatever's on our minds.

01:18:27.868 --> 01:18:31.271
About facing our fears,
and looking for answers,

01:18:31.305 --> 01:18:35.243
'cause who knows?
Maybe there aren't any.

01:18:38.212 --> 01:18:40.148
Maybe we can all find
a little peace in that.

01:18:43.917 --> 01:18:48.889
Yeah. you know,
it's been a long time

01:18:48.922 --> 01:18:51.760
since I've felt those things,

01:18:51.792 --> 01:18:56.497
and I'll tell you,
I feel them now,

01:18:56.530 --> 01:18:59.734
here, with all of you.

01:19:03.203 --> 01:19:05.206
And say, that reminds me,
there is something

01:19:05.238 --> 01:19:09.043
I wanted to talk about here.

01:19:10.077 --> 01:19:13.414
Look, last night...

01:19:15.115 --> 01:19:16.451
Sat down to read,

01:19:16.484 --> 01:19:18.153
of course, I couldn't
fall asleep,

01:19:18.185 --> 01:19:20.554
and I'm sure I'm not
the only one.

01:19:44.612 --> 01:19:47.282
Hey there, Chardy!

01:20:18.212 --> 01:20:20.248
She took quite a lump
before we crashed the car,

01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:21.582
but she's gonna be
back to normal soon.

01:20:21.615 --> 01:20:24.385
Everything's gonna be
just like it was,

01:20:24.417 --> 01:20:26.220
exactly the same.

01:20:44.070 --> 01:20:46.407
-Afternoon.
-Hello, Clark.

01:20:46.439 --> 01:20:49.109
-How are you?
-Me, I'm fine.

01:20:49.143 --> 01:20:51.980
-How are you?
-I'm fine.

01:20:52.012 --> 01:20:55.082
Some people were having
problems with their phones

01:20:55.115 --> 01:20:57.385
when the lines were crossed
and I was just checking

01:20:57.417 --> 01:20:59.519
to see if everything's
set here?

01:20:59.552 --> 01:21:02.590
-Yes, we're fine.
-Good.

01:21:02.622 --> 01:21:04.324
We were about to eat lunch.

01:21:04.358 --> 01:21:06.561
-Could you step outside?
-Now's not a good time.

01:21:06.594 --> 01:21:08.096
Please.

01:21:17.671 --> 01:21:21.408
Lorraine, last night...

01:21:21.442 --> 01:21:25.145
-It's a hoax.
-What?

01:21:25.179 --> 01:21:29.617
Well, everything that happened,
none of it was real.

01:21:29.649 --> 01:21:32.052
Some of it was real.

01:21:32.086 --> 01:21:33.621
We thought there were
martians coming.

01:21:33.654 --> 01:21:35.323
Martians.

01:21:35.355 --> 01:21:37.057
You can blame that broadcast
if you want, Lorraine,

01:21:37.091 --> 01:21:38.259
but if you stay with him,
you know what's...

01:21:38.292 --> 01:21:40.228
What am I supposed to do?

01:21:40.261 --> 01:21:42.096
Leave my husband,
just like that?

01:21:42.128 --> 01:21:43.931
Yes, he left you.

01:21:43.965 --> 01:21:45.300
He went for help.

01:21:45.332 --> 01:21:48.502
That note, Lorraine,
that note, that was help?

01:21:48.536 --> 01:21:51.538
He explained it.
It wasn't what I thought.

01:21:51.572 --> 01:21:53.608
It was a misunderstanding.

01:21:57.545 --> 01:22:01.349
I know you're afraid.
I understand that.

01:22:01.381 --> 01:22:03.350
But if I were you,
I'd be more afraid

01:22:03.384 --> 01:22:05.420
of slinking back
into your old life.

01:22:05.453 --> 01:22:08.623
That's what I'd be afraid of.

01:22:08.655 --> 01:22:11.659
He went for help.

01:22:16.130 --> 01:22:18.033
Hey, hey! There he is.

01:22:19.399 --> 01:22:22.135
Clark, I don't know
how to thank you enough

01:22:22.168 --> 01:22:23.738
for looking after Lorraine
last night.

01:22:23.770 --> 01:22:26.673
When I went for help,
my first thought was,

01:22:26.707 --> 01:22:29.677
"if she gets herself in a pickle,
Clark will lend a hand,"

01:22:29.710 --> 01:22:31.512
so thank you.
Seriously.

01:22:33.247 --> 01:22:34.682
My pleasure.

01:22:34.715 --> 01:22:37.150
Well, come on inside,
Lorraine made a pot roast.

01:22:37.184 --> 01:22:38.586
That's one way to start
repaying you, right?

01:22:38.618 --> 01:22:40.454
No, thank you.
I have a lot on my plate,

01:22:40.488 --> 01:22:44.659
and I... I... I was
just checking in.

01:22:44.692 --> 01:22:46.328
We'll see you around then.

01:22:48.628 --> 01:22:50.398
Shucks.
You know what, Clark?

01:22:50.430 --> 01:22:52.399
I gotta get back
to this rotolactor mess.

01:22:52.432 --> 01:22:55.670
The insurance company needs
measurements and photographs,

01:22:55.703 --> 01:22:58.706
the whole ball of wax,
so get a few men,

01:22:58.738 --> 01:23:01.641
a couple shovels,
tape measure.

01:23:01.675 --> 01:23:03.077
It could be a few hours.

01:23:03.109 --> 01:23:04.645
Meet me there?

01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:09.083
However long it takes,

01:23:09.115 --> 01:23:10.452
I'll wait for you.

01:23:14.354 --> 01:23:16.256
Okay.

01:23:55.762 --> 01:24:00.734
They're calling it the hoax
that terrified a nation.

01:24:00.768 --> 01:24:04.505
It says here about
six million listening in.

01:24:04.537 --> 01:24:06.540
Whole lot of suckers.

01:24:06.573 --> 01:24:09.743
About 100 of them right here
in Lullaby, hey, Pepper?

01:24:09.777 --> 01:24:12.680
I sure fell for it.

01:24:12.712 --> 01:24:15.750
Didn't help goddamn Collins
stirring everyone up.

01:24:18.385 --> 01:24:21.389
Oughta run him outta town for
what he made happen around here.

01:24:26.659 --> 01:24:29.396
At least someone made
something happen around here.

01:25:10.604 --> 01:25:12.673
I saw that.

01:25:18.779 --> 01:25:21.149
I asked Paul to leave.

01:25:21.181 --> 01:25:23.751
He's packing now,

01:25:23.783 --> 01:25:27.554
but he packed last night, too,
so it shouldn't take long.

01:25:31.225 --> 01:25:34.362
This isn't a hoax,
too, is it?

01:25:34.395 --> 01:25:39.534
This is real, right?
I need to know.

01:25:39.567 --> 01:25:42.203
No.

01:25:42.235 --> 01:25:43.704
This is not a hoax.

01:25:48.242 --> 01:25:49.811
I promise.
