<i>I'm going to talk to
Parker about my promotion today.</i>

01:33.428 --> 01:37.015
In the worst-case scenario
you're two weeks ahead of me,

01:37.098 --> 01:40.184
you get a gorgeous little
apartment in the Marais.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.687
What if I don't want
to live in the Marais?

01:45.773 --> 01:47.317
<i>We could live
somewhere else, then.</i>

01:47.900 --> 01:49.777
Yeah?
Yeah.

01:49.861 --> 01:51.404
We could go to Detroit.

01:51.487 --> 01:52.488
Detroit?

01:52.572 --> 01:54.699
Yeah, you could
meet my mom and dad.

01:56.451 --> 01:59.037
<i>You can meet my sister.
She owns a bakery,</i>

01:59.287 --> 02:01.080
and she will make you fat.

02:12.884 --> 02:16.220
I have six hours before I have
to go back to the hospital.

02:18.473 --> 02:20.767
You want to go
back into bed with me?

02:22.477 --> 02:23.645
<i>I do.</i>

02:25.563 --> 02:27.774
But I got back-to-back
meetings all morning.

02:28.983 --> 02:30.360
Too bad for you.

02:30.443 --> 02:31.861
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

02:32.570 --> 02:33.529
<i>But I got to get in.</i>

02:33.613 --> 02:34.656
<i>There's probably
already 25 people</i>

02:34.739 --> 02:36.407
<i>lined up outside
the door, waiting.</i>

02:44.749 --> 02:46.376
I love when you speak French.

03:02.308 --> 03:03.518
<i>Satcom check.</i>

03:03.601 --> 03:06.604
Echo Nine Three
Victor Echo Two.

03:07.563 --> 03:08.564
<i>Ops Center.</i>

03:08.648 --> 03:10.817
<i>This is safe house 7-R.
We're open for business.</i>

03:10.900 --> 03:11.901
<i>Confirmed.</i>

03:11.984 --> 03:13.653
<i>Any reservations?</i>

03:13.736 --> 03:14.904
<i>Nothing in the registry.</i>

03:14.987 --> 03:16.155
<i>Walk-ins?</i>

03:16.239 --> 03:19.158
<i>Not expected.
Reconfirm in three hours.</i>

03:19.242 --> 03:20.785
Understood.

03:36.259 --> 03:38.678
<i>Matt?
Your cell, really?</i>

03:38.761 --> 03:41.806
Relax, I've got
an encryption packet.

03:42.181 --> 03:43.891
<i>You know me, I never relax.</i>

03:43.975 --> 03:46.060
Watch the cholesterol, old man.

03:46.144 --> 03:47.478
<i>You sound like Miriam.</i>

03:47.562 --> 03:49.230
So, what's new in Cape Town?

03:49.313 --> 03:50.398
<i>Nothing, nothing.</i>

03:50.481 --> 03:53.109
<i>I updated my Surveillance Target Analysis.
It's complete now.</i>

03:53.192 --> 03:55.486
Yeah, that's an exit report.
It's not due until you leave.

03:55.570 --> 03:58.531
Exactly. Exactly.
And when is that?

03:58.614 --> 03:59.657
<i>How long has it been?</i>

03:59.782 --> 04:01.325
Twelve months.

04:01.409 --> 04:03.202
<i>Well, talk to me
in another four.</i>

04:03.286 --> 04:05.705
David, I'm dying here.

04:06.205 --> 04:07.749
What's happening
with the post in Paris?

04:08.124 --> 04:10.001
One slot, 37 applicants.

04:10.126 --> 04:12.420
Every one of them with more
field experience than you.

04:12.503 --> 04:14.380
How am I supposed to
get more experience?

04:14.464 --> 04:16.548
I'm staring at
four walls all day.

04:16.882 --> 04:19.260
I got passed up on Rome,
then Berlin.

04:19.343 --> 04:20.887
<i>You said yourself, my
evaluation was excellent.</i>

04:20.970 --> 04:22.764
<i>Just put it in
front of Whitford.</i>

04:22.847 --> 04:25.349
I know he'll see that I'm
ready to go, I'm all in.

04:25.558 --> 04:28.144
Matt, I know
this has been hard,

04:28.227 --> 04:30.229
<i>but it's the way
the system works.</i>

04:30.521 --> 04:33.775
<i>Look, I'll talk to Whitford about
Paris, but I can't promise anything.</i>

04:34.984 --> 04:35.985
<i>Look, I've got to go.</i>

04:37.195 --> 04:39.739
Don't worry,
I'm looking after you, okay?

04:40.615 --> 04:42.533
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.

05:17.360 --> 05:18.986
<i>This is not a negotiation.</i>

05:22.698 --> 05:24.408
<i>It's 10 million.</i>

05:24.826 --> 05:26.202
You'll get the file,
and if the money

05:26.285 --> 05:28.037
is not in the account
by 3:00 p.m.,

05:28.746 --> 05:30.957
<i>I'll take it to another buyer.</i>

05:31.582 --> 05:34.252
<i>How do we know
that you won't do that anyway?</i>

05:36.128 --> 05:37.463
You don't.

05:53.938 --> 05:55.481
Here you are, sir.

05:57.525 --> 06:00.403
Alec, how are you?

06:05.575 --> 06:08.995
Petrus, 1972.

06:09.829 --> 06:10.830
You look good.

06:11.455 --> 06:13.124
I do, don't I?

06:15.960 --> 06:17.879
So, how are things at MI6?

06:17.962 --> 06:22.049
The usual. Same bureaucratic
bullshit and appalling remuneration.

06:22.133 --> 06:23.217
Life of a government man.

06:23.301 --> 06:24.343
Mmm-hmm.

06:28.472 --> 06:29.557
So...

06:33.144 --> 06:34.312
The original file.

06:34.645 --> 06:37.189
Dates, transactions, names.

06:37.315 --> 06:38.941
A bargain at triple the price.

06:39.692 --> 06:41.402
Take a look.

06:41.944 --> 06:42.945
Hmm.

06:46.908 --> 06:49.410
I've been waiting
a long time for this.

06:53.331 --> 06:54.498
Tobin...

06:55.750 --> 06:56.792
What's in that box
is going to make

06:56.876 --> 06:58.210
the world
a smaller place for you,

06:58.294 --> 06:59.462
for both of us.

07:02.465 --> 07:03.466
I got your account.

07:03.549 --> 07:06.093
You get your cut
24 hours after transaction.

07:06.177 --> 07:07.720
Some of our old bosses
aren't going to be happy

07:07.803 --> 07:09.639
these files are out
in the open.

07:11.015 --> 07:12.350
Do I make you nervous?

07:13.976 --> 07:15.686
Always.
Good.

08:43.024 --> 08:44.025
You want her?

09:39.080 --> 09:40.873
Please, listen to me.

09:41.624 --> 09:43.167
I had nothing to do with this.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.502
Stop.

09:51.884 --> 09:52.927
Let's go.

10:00.935 --> 10:03.270
Tobin, you have to believe me.

10:03.354 --> 10:05.898
I knew nothing
about any of that.

10:05.981 --> 10:07.566
Did you know if
anybody was following you?

10:07.650 --> 10:10.778
No, I don't think
anybody was following me.

10:10.861 --> 10:12.488
I swear on my life,
Tobin, I had absolutely...

10:56.740 --> 10:57.741
Slow down.

11:18.345 --> 11:19.555
We're going by foot.

11:20.139 --> 11:21.599
<i>Head towards the square.</i>

12:29.333 --> 12:31.001
Move! Move! Move!

12:39.802 --> 12:41.136
We're heading west.

12:41.387 --> 12:43.597
<i>Holland Street.
Move, move.</i>

13:17.965 --> 13:19.550
Excuse me, sir.
Thank you.

13:41.572 --> 13:43.866
My name is Tobin Frost.

13:49.913 --> 13:51.206
Linklater.

13:54.960 --> 13:55.961
When?

13:57.379 --> 13:58.505
Lock down the consulate.

13:59.173 --> 14:01.133
Get me a team in the Situation
Room in five minutes.

14:01.216 --> 14:02.634
I want everything we got
on Tobin Frost.

14:02.718 --> 14:03.719
Yes, ma'am.

14:07.222 --> 14:09.141
Is it him?
Yep.

14:09.224 --> 14:10.225
Whitford know?

14:10.309 --> 14:11.643
I'm on my way there now.

14:20.069 --> 14:22.780
Sir, place your finger in
there until I tell you to stop.

14:24.239 --> 14:25.240
Thank you.

14:27.493 --> 14:29.953
So how long has he been
playing in your backyard?

14:30.037 --> 14:31.872
We're working to get you
that answer right now.

14:31.955 --> 14:32.956
Meaning you don't know.

14:33.207 --> 14:34.458
No, meaning,
we're looking into it.

14:35.084 --> 14:37.252
The guy goes rogue,
he spends nine years

14:37.336 --> 14:39.046
selling out the Agency
to all takers.

14:39.129 --> 14:41.173
To Russia, China, Iran,
you name it.

14:41.632 --> 14:43.008
The guy is just not
going to prance

14:43.092 --> 14:45.177
into an American consulate
without good reason.

14:48.347 --> 14:49.973
All right, listen up.

14:50.057 --> 14:51.308
Everybody off the phone.

14:53.811 --> 14:56.105
Tobin Frost has
just waltzed his way

14:56.188 --> 14:58.649
into a U.S. Consulate
in Cape Town, South Africa.

14:59.108 --> 15:00.776
Now this man, without question,

15:00.859 --> 15:02.986
is one of the most notorious
traders that we've got.

15:03.362 --> 15:04.988
Errington, call up
his background profile.

15:07.408 --> 15:10.744
Tobin Frost was
recruited into the Agency in 1984.

15:10.828 --> 15:13.872
He tested off the charts in aptitude
for psychological field work.

15:14.665 --> 15:17.668
His first assignment was in
Lebanon, in January, 1985.

15:18.043 --> 15:20.129
Three months later,
he captured and flipped

15:20.212 --> 15:21.505
a high-ranking
Hezbollah leader.

15:22.548 --> 15:23.715
<i>Over the next several years,</i>

15:23.799 --> 15:27.511
<i>Frost successfully questioned and
recruited many high-value individuals.</i>

15:27.594 --> 15:30.514
He became known as an expert
manipulator of human assets,

15:30.597 --> 15:33.434
and he literally rewrote Agency
interrogation protocols.

15:33.517 --> 15:35.018
Frost served
in many active theaters,

15:35.102 --> 15:37.938
including Libya
from 1995 to 1998,

15:38.021 --> 15:39.690
Jordan, 1998 to 2000.

15:40.023 --> 15:41.358
During his tenure in Jordan,

15:41.442 --> 15:43.318
Frost was suspected of leaking
information to Mossad,

15:43.402 --> 15:45.529
but nothing was confirmed.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.948
Ten years ago, Frost went off
the reservation completely.

15:48.031 --> 15:49.992
<i>He currently has no allegiances</i>

15:50.075 --> 15:52.703
<i>and is wanted for espionage
on four continents.</i>

15:52.786 --> 15:56.582
His last known sighting
is Hamburg, Germany, in 2011.

15:56.665 --> 15:59.918
You know, Harlan, we should
interrogate Frost now.

16:00.002 --> 16:01.420
Sweat him for
everything he's got.

16:01.503 --> 16:03.505
Once he's stateside,
we have fewer options.

16:03.589 --> 16:05.632
I have an interrogator in Yemen,
can be there in eight hours.

16:05.716 --> 16:07.926
I already have a team in Jo'burg
that can be there in two.

16:08.010 --> 16:09.845
We'll take Frost to the safe
house, interrogate him there.

16:09.928 --> 16:11.805
My people are fully
capable of handling this.

16:11.889 --> 16:13.682
This is Tobin Frost.

16:16.977 --> 16:18.395
We'll go with Jo'burg.

16:21.356 --> 16:22.357
Okay.

16:27.154 --> 16:28.906
You must turn around.

16:31.742 --> 16:34.745
Help. Help.

16:38.874 --> 16:40.083
Accident.

16:51.261 --> 16:52.221
Housekeeping.

16:52.304 --> 16:54.723
<i>We have
a last-minute reservation.</i>

16:54.806 --> 16:56.099
ETA for check-in?

16:56.183 --> 16:58.727
<i>Sometime tonight.
Freeark Insurance.</i>

16:58.810 --> 17:00.103
Got it.

17:06.359 --> 17:07.528
<i>Hello.</i>
Hey.

17:07.611 --> 17:08.612
<i>Hey, where are you?</i>

17:08.862 --> 17:11.156
<i>Parker just handed me
his oversight papers to finish</i>

17:11.240 --> 17:13.825
and his daughter Chloe's got the
measles, can you believe that?

17:14.201 --> 17:15.618
How long are you
going to be out for?

17:15.702 --> 17:18.038
<i>I don't know.
I don't know.</i>

17:18.121 --> 17:19.748
Okay. Well, look,
I'm gonna dive into this,

17:19.830 --> 17:22.459
and then hopefully I can meet
up with you later, okay?

17:22.542 --> 17:23.794
<i>Yeah, that sounds good.</i>

17:23.877 --> 17:25.002
Hey, hey...

17:27.214 --> 17:28.214
<i>I love you.</i>

17:28.799 --> 17:29.883
I love you, too.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.302
Bye.
<i>Bye.</i>

17:47.276 --> 17:49.528
Extraction team
is in the air, sir.

17:49.611 --> 17:51.071
They should be on the
ground within the hour.

17:51.154 --> 17:53.574
I want that team in and out of
the city in less than 12 hours.

17:53.991 --> 17:54.992
We're not even supposed to have

17:55.075 --> 17:56.660
- a presence in Cape Town.
- Yes, sir.

17:57.661 --> 18:01.832
<i>Any communications about Frost's
whereabouts are strictly need-to-know.</i>

18:10.215 --> 18:12.676
Sir, the extraction team is en
route to the consulate now.

18:18.849 --> 18:20.183
Who's reaching out
to 7-R?

18:20.267 --> 18:21.435
Richards, ma'am.

18:21.518 --> 18:22.936
I want the housekeeper briefed.

18:23.020 --> 18:25.022
High-priority target is coming in.
I want the house quiet.

18:25.105 --> 18:26.356
Under no circumstances
should there be

18:26.440 --> 18:28.025
any communication
until the team has left.

18:28.317 --> 18:29.401
Yes, ma'am.

19:00.140 --> 19:01.141
Yeah?

19:01.224 --> 19:02.309
<i>Do you have a room?</i>

19:02.392 --> 19:03.644
Account?
<i>Daniel Kiefer.</i>

19:03.727 --> 19:06.563
Freeark Insurance.
K-I-E-F-E-R.

19:07.773 --> 19:10.942
Kiefer. Freeark Insurance.
K-I-E-F-E-R.

19:11.026 --> 19:12.027
<i>You are a go.</i>

19:13.070 --> 19:14.071
You're good to go.

19:30.921 --> 19:32.089
Hi, I'm Weston.
Guest room?

19:32.339 --> 19:34.883
It's right around the corner.
Two rights and a left.

19:35.425 --> 19:36.468
All the way back.

19:59.199 --> 20:00.992
That's Tobin Frost.

20:01.076 --> 20:03.370
Stay with him. Let's
go download our gear.

20:03.453 --> 20:04.454
Yes, sir.

20:26.268 --> 20:27.269
Linen closet?

20:27.519 --> 20:29.146
Down the hall. Just right
at the end, there.

20:32.149 --> 20:34.192
Kill all the surveillance
cameras in this room.

20:51.668 --> 20:53.086
<i>My name is Daniel Kiefer.</i>

20:55.839 --> 20:57.007
<i>We were at The Farm together.</i>

20:59.050 --> 21:01.011
<i>Technically,
you were a year ahead.</i>

21:04.931 --> 21:07.434
I'm here to make you
aware of your rights.

21:08.852 --> 21:10.812
You're being held under
a National Security Directive,

21:10.896 --> 21:12.606
which means you have none,
but you know that.

21:12.689 --> 21:13.690
Six-hundreds.

21:16.193 --> 21:17.611
The towels,
you need six-hundreds.

21:17.694 --> 21:21.198
Those are 350,
375-gram weight.

21:23.200 --> 21:24.868
You're gonna
need six-hundreds.

21:30.624 --> 21:33.376
<i>I want to know the reasons
for you being in Cape Town.</i>

21:34.586 --> 21:38.298
I want you to name your
resources, contacts, assets,

21:38.381 --> 21:39.800
everybody you've
done business with,

21:39.883 --> 21:41.468
traded intel with,
sold secrets to,

21:41.551 --> 21:44.262
in the nine years since you
betrayed your country.

21:45.680 --> 21:48.308
Absolutely.
Anything you want, Daniel.

21:54.481 --> 21:57.651
<i>Khalid Sheikh
Mohammed lasted 20 seconds.</i>

21:58.068 --> 21:59.945
They had six-hundreds.

22:19.005 --> 22:20.590
Is this legal?

22:28.807 --> 22:30.100
Bring him down.

22:55.542 --> 22:56.626
Bring him up.

23:11.600 --> 23:12.809
How long was that?

23:20.817 --> 23:22.235
All right, take him down.

23:40.128 --> 23:41.171
Bring him up!

23:56.978 --> 23:58.063
Get me a knife.

24:04.903 --> 24:05.904
Miller?

24:15.038 --> 24:16.164
Get in there with Frost.

24:16.247 --> 24:17.666
Sir, all the security cameras
are down.

24:17.791 --> 24:19.709
- Reboot. I want to see what's out there.
- Copy that.

24:21.002 --> 24:22.003
Let's go, boys!

24:23.088 --> 24:24.214
Go! Go! Go!

24:25.423 --> 24:27.050
Let's go, move!

24:33.181 --> 24:34.766
Velez, take this corner.

24:35.308 --> 24:37.394
Ericksson,
get the back elevator.

24:43.400 --> 24:44.776
Pope, what do you got?

24:44.859 --> 24:49.155
Sir, I see approximately 12
heavily armed men in perimeter two.

24:49.239 --> 24:51.825
Okay, gents!
Work fore to aft.

24:51.908 --> 24:53.868
Two-by-twos.
Perimeter two.

25:00.834 --> 25:02.293
- Greer?
- Sir!

25:03.044 --> 25:04.879
- Ericksson?
- Yes, sir.

25:05.296 --> 25:06.506
Velez?

25:07.841 --> 25:09.509
Velez?

25:09.592 --> 25:10.885
I'm good!

25:12.262 --> 25:13.680
Let's go, fellas.

25:30.947 --> 25:33.033
- Incoming!
- Grenade!

25:50.050 --> 25:51.593
Greer!

25:52.719 --> 25:55.013
Step-slide!
Start walking back!

25:59.059 --> 26:00.602
Velez!
Three-round bursts!

26:12.989 --> 26:14.574
Velez, where's Greer?

26:14.657 --> 26:15.909
He's over there, sir.

26:16.618 --> 26:17.619
Go, son.

26:27.003 --> 26:29.422
This ain't a test.
This is the real thing.

26:33.676 --> 26:34.677
What are you gonna do?

26:35.261 --> 26:36.346
You don't want to try me.

26:44.229 --> 26:46.022
- Magazine!
- Let's go.

26:52.028 --> 26:53.947
Velez, stay there!

26:54.531 --> 26:55.949
Listen to me, stay there!

27:01.579 --> 27:02.580
Son of a bitch!

27:11.005 --> 27:12.006
Miller!

27:15.009 --> 27:16.010
Miller!

27:17.470 --> 27:18.888
Hey! Get in here!

27:21.933 --> 27:23.685
Hey, hey. Take these.

27:23.768 --> 27:25.186
Go watch him.

27:40.952 --> 27:43.830
Hey, they're here for me,
but they want me alive.

27:43.913 --> 27:44.998
You, they'll kill.

27:49.878 --> 27:50.920
You got one in the chamber?

27:54.883 --> 27:56.176
It's okay.

27:56.926 --> 28:00.096
I remember my first posting.
Rio de Janeiro.

28:00.180 --> 28:02.849
A house like this.
Beautiful women.

28:02.932 --> 28:05.351
Not one single visitor, but
I remember rule number one.

28:05.435 --> 28:07.437
You are responsible
for your houseguest.

28:07.520 --> 28:08.521
I'm your houseguest.

28:13.651 --> 28:17.363
The clock is ticking.
They gave you the keys.

28:17.447 --> 28:18.489
Do your duty, son.

28:18.781 --> 28:21.201
Shut up. Let me think.

28:25.496 --> 28:27.290
You want to be the guy
that lost Tobin Frost?

28:32.795 --> 28:35.423
Tick-took,
tick-took, tick-took.

28:59.072 --> 29:00.823
Where's Frost?

29:24.597 --> 29:26.057
We're leaving.

29:43.700 --> 29:44.993
Where is he?

30:03.386 --> 30:05.638
Stay here, stay here!
Wait! Don't move!

30:09.350 --> 30:10.310
Hey, hey, hey!

30:16.899 --> 30:17.900
Go!

30:21.446 --> 30:22.447
Get in the trunk.

30:22.530 --> 30:24.532
Are you serious?
Yeah, get in.

30:24.615 --> 30:26.534
The trunk?
Get in the trunk now!

30:48.723 --> 30:49.724
No!

31:08.743 --> 31:09.702
<i>Ops Center.</i>

31:09.786 --> 31:11.996
Echo Three Victor Echo Nine.

31:12.080 --> 31:13.039
<i>Go ahead.</i>

31:13.122 --> 31:15.500
This is Weston. 7-R's been hit.
Everyone's dead.

31:16.125 --> 31:17.835
<i>I need you to repeat that, please.
Say again.</i>

31:17.919 --> 31:21.047
Kiefer, his team, everyone,
they're all dead.

31:21.130 --> 31:22.382
<i>Stand by.</i>

31:24.509 --> 31:25.510
<i>Transferring.</i>

31:26.511 --> 31:28.638
It's the house.

31:30.139 --> 31:31.766
Linklater.
<i>This is Weston.</i>

31:31.849 --> 31:33.309
The safe house
has been breached.

31:34.977 --> 31:36.145
What's your location?

31:36.312 --> 31:38.231
<i>I'm eastbound on Albert Road.</i>

31:38.314 --> 31:40.817
<i>I'm just passing Woodstock.</i>

31:42.568 --> 31:44.654
I want eyes on this.
Real-time sat feed.

31:45.113 --> 31:47.615
<i>And what's
the location of the guest?</i>

31:47.865 --> 31:49.200
<i>We escaped.</i>

31:49.283 --> 31:50.952
<i>Clarify.
Do you have the guest?</i>

31:51.160 --> 31:52.328
Yes, we escaped!

31:53.162 --> 31:54.747
Look, I can make it
to the consulate.

31:54.831 --> 31:56.082
<i>There's no chance for SDR,</i>

31:56.165 --> 31:57.375
<i>I think I might have
picked up a tail.</i>

31:57.834 --> 31:59.669
We can't have a gun battle
in front of the consulate.

32:00.878 --> 32:02.213
Diplomatic catastrophe.

32:02.505 --> 32:04.006
Where's that satellite feed?

32:04.090 --> 32:06.217
Denied by National Recon.
War theater use only.

32:07.176 --> 32:08.886
Buy us some time.

32:11.806 --> 32:13.015
Do not go to the consulate.

32:13.683 --> 32:15.601
<i>Follow protocol Alpha Zero.</i>

32:15.935 --> 32:18.312
<i>Secure the guest
and stay off the grid.</i>

32:18.646 --> 32:22.525
Reconnect at 1800 hours.
I repeat, stay off the grid.

32:23.151 --> 32:24.777
Copy, copy, copy.

35:36.969 --> 35:38.763
All right, Cape Town police
have responded to the house.

35:38.888 --> 35:40.139
Confirmed. LINKLATER: I
want the site secured.

35:40.222 --> 35:41.223
I'm hearing nine dead.

35:41.724 --> 35:42.892
Initiating damage control.

35:43.059 --> 35:44.727
I'm on it.
Reaching out to NIA now.

35:45.561 --> 35:47.772
The locals are going to
have that house locked off.

35:48.731 --> 35:51.817
<i>Check all the traffic
cameras, police reports...</i>

35:52.360 --> 35:55.529
<i>Find out why Frost wanted to go
in that consulate to begin with</i>

35:55.613 --> 35:57.198
and who in the hell else
might be after him.

35:59.533 --> 36:02.119
We need to get Weston and
Frost out of South Africa.

36:02.244 --> 36:04.955
Now, do we have any tactical teams?
Anything in play?

36:05.039 --> 36:07.416
Yeah, I have assets in
Egypt, but they're in deep.

36:07.500 --> 36:09.835
If I pull them out, that would
compromise two years' worth of work.

36:09.919 --> 36:11.462
I can scramble a team
from Europe or Asia,

36:11.545 --> 36:13.756
but it's going to
take at least 18 hours.

36:15.257 --> 36:17.968
At this point,
Weston is all we got.

36:21.597 --> 36:24.934
I need to find out who this
Matt Weston is, right now.

36:26.727 --> 36:28.104
<i>Matthew James Weston.</i>

36:28.938 --> 36:32.066
<i>Born 02-24-82 to
Terry and Madeline Weston</i>

36:32.149 --> 36:33.943
<i>in Port Washington, New York.</i>

36:34.110 --> 36:35.361
<i>An assault arrest,
one month after</i>

36:35.444 --> 36:36.487
<i>both parents and
a younger sister</i>

36:36.570 --> 36:38.197
<i>were killed in
a traffic accident</i>

36:38.280 --> 36:39.865
<i>in which his
father's blood-alcohol</i>

36:39.949 --> 36:41.659
<i>was twice the legal limit.</i>

36:41.951 --> 36:45.329
Yale, degree in Economics,
recruited out of Yale law.

36:45.663 --> 36:48.624
<i>High marks in analytics
and linguistics at The Farm.</i>

36:48.833 --> 36:51.210
<i>Excellent in tradecraft skills.</i>

36:51.293 --> 36:54.338
His girlfriend, Ana Moreau,
is a French national.

36:55.131 --> 36:58.551
<i>He reported them as having
"close and continuing contact."</i>

36:58.634 --> 37:01.512
<i>She's a second year resident in the
oncology department at Groote Schuur.</i>

37:01.595 --> 37:02.555
Get in that car.

37:02.638 --> 37:04.765
She accepted a
position with Hotel-Dieu Hospital

37:04.849 --> 37:06.517
in Paris, starts in two weeks.

37:06.934 --> 37:09.311
No known political
affiliations. She's clean.

37:10.062 --> 37:11.939
I want you to post a car
outside their apartment.

37:12.022 --> 37:13.524
Use back channels.

37:13.607 --> 37:17.403
And get NSA to cross-check their telephone
records and their e-mails, please.

37:17.486 --> 37:18.487
Yes, ma'am.

37:31.333 --> 37:33.753
You know, it would be easier
if I knew where we were going.

37:33.836 --> 37:37.006
You just drive, all right?
Just drive, middle lane.

37:37.089 --> 37:38.257
All right.

37:39.675 --> 37:42.428
Hey, what are you doing?
Middle lane.

37:44.513 --> 37:45.556
Just drive around.

37:45.639 --> 37:47.767
All right.
I'm driving.

37:52.354 --> 37:54.356
Nice to know who you're talking to.
What's your name?

37:55.357 --> 37:56.609
You crushed my windpipe.

37:56.692 --> 37:58.694
Well, you locked me
in the trunk.

38:01.989 --> 38:04.241
Come on, you're not NOC. You're
here under your real name.

38:04.325 --> 38:05.284
What is it?

38:05.367 --> 38:06.494
Weston, Matt.

38:06.577 --> 38:08.204
All right.

38:08.287 --> 38:10.080
How long you been
a safe house keeper?

38:10.164 --> 38:11.123
Twelve months.

38:11.207 --> 38:12.374
Happy birthday.

38:15.085 --> 38:17.004
Cape Town,
that's low-level detail.

38:17.087 --> 38:19.757
You should have been
out of here by now.

38:20.007 --> 38:21.926
Maybe I requested
the assignment.

38:23.177 --> 38:26.597
Or maybe Langley doesn't trust
you with anything else.

38:29.517 --> 38:31.143
So, what's your plan?

38:32.394 --> 38:34.230
Oh, let me guess.
Follow protocol.

38:34.313 --> 38:36.482
Protocol states that
if your house is crashed,

38:36.565 --> 38:39.360
you do an SDR to make sure
no one's following you.

38:39.777 --> 38:43.656
Activate your GPS in your Go-Bag,
select another safe house.

38:45.407 --> 38:47.743
You think I'm going to
let you just take me in?

38:48.077 --> 38:49.328
I think you need to shut up.

38:50.538 --> 38:53.207
I think you need to consider how your
house was attacked in the first place.

38:53.290 --> 38:55.292
Have you done that, Matt?

38:58.462 --> 39:00.840
They followed Kiefer. They
followed him from the consulate,

39:00.923 --> 39:02.007
and that's how they
found the safe house.

39:02.091 --> 39:03.717
Come on, you don't really
believe that, do you?

39:03.801 --> 39:07.304
How did they know I was near the
consulate in the first place?

39:09.515 --> 39:10.641
Hmm.

39:11.350 --> 39:14.061
But I like this, you know.
You and me, figuring shit out.

39:14.937 --> 39:17.064
Like the Hardy Boys.

39:19.149 --> 39:21.193
That house was
a secure location.

39:21.277 --> 39:22.611
Whoever crashed it

39:22.695 --> 39:26.866
didn't stop by a gas station and ask for
directions to the nearest safe house.

39:26.949 --> 39:29.243
They were invited. Someone
told them, Matthew.

39:29.326 --> 39:31.579
Think about it.
Someone you know.

39:31.662 --> 39:34.415
So you better ask yourself,
can you trust your landlord?

39:35.040 --> 39:36.292
Go ahead, you're not
going to get in my head.

39:36.375 --> 39:38.836
I already am in your head.

39:38.919 --> 39:40.546
They're going to
isolate you, Matt.

39:40.629 --> 39:41.922
They're going to be real
nice to you at first.

39:42.006 --> 39:44.717
They're going to put their arm
around you and tell you things like,

39:44.800 --> 39:47.803
"You did a decent job, son
We'll take it from here."

39:47.887 --> 39:49.305
That's when you know
you're screwed.

39:50.806 --> 39:52.391
Forget about me. They're
going to focus on you.

39:52.474 --> 39:54.685
They're going to try and make a
connection between you and I.

39:55.311 --> 39:56.729
So that if this all goes wrong,

39:56.812 --> 39:58.397
they'll have something
to fall back on

39:58.480 --> 40:00.858
in their little
Senate hearings.

40:04.695 --> 40:06.697
I'm not your
only enemy tonight.

40:09.283 --> 40:10.743
<i>So, it's someone in-house.</i>

40:10.826 --> 40:12.995
It's the only way this
thing could've happened.

40:13.078 --> 40:14.705
We were completely buttoned up.

40:16.582 --> 40:18.918
I want a list of everyone
who knew about this.

40:19.001 --> 40:20.502
Backgrounds, affiliations,

40:21.170 --> 40:23.213
particularly any
connections with Frost.

40:23.297 --> 40:25.841
Every movement right
up until this operation.

40:26.300 --> 40:28.552
Your extraction team, how
long had they been together?

40:29.553 --> 40:32.473
My team had been together
six months. Why?

40:33.140 --> 40:35.434
Well, I'm just trying to
get my head around this.

40:36.852 --> 40:37.978
That will do, thank you.

42:26.378 --> 42:27.713
<i>Hello.</i>
Hey.

42:28.505 --> 42:29.840
<i>Baby, where are you?</i>

42:29.923 --> 42:31.800
I'm all right.
I'm okay.

42:32.885 --> 42:33.927
I'm okay.

42:35.804 --> 42:38.432
<i>I'm sorry I didn't call you
back, I saw your missed calls.</i>

42:38.515 --> 42:40.184
<i>You must be worried sick.</i>

42:40.267 --> 42:41.518
Is everything okay?

42:42.352 --> 42:45.314
<i>I'm good.
I'm good. Listen.</i>

42:45.397 --> 42:47.024
<i>This sounds so crazy.</i>

42:47.399 --> 42:49.526
We had some threats against
the clinic last night,

42:49.610 --> 42:50.778
so Parker and I,
we stayed all night

42:50.861 --> 42:53.072
trying to get to
the bottom of it.

42:53.822 --> 42:57.034
<i>And I'm sorry that I didn't call you back.
I should have, right away.</i>

42:57.117 --> 42:58.660
I was so worried.

42:58.911 --> 43:00.245
<i>I know.</i>

43:02.956 --> 43:06.126
Can you do me a favor? Can you go
over to the window for a second?

43:06.210 --> 43:07.336
<i>Why?</i>

43:07.711 --> 43:09.838
<i>Can you just take a quick
look out the window?</i>

43:09.922 --> 43:11.965
<i>I want you to see if
there's anyone out there.</i>

43:12.049 --> 43:14.134
<i>Are there any cars
that don't belong?</i>

43:14.218 --> 43:16.011
<i>Anyone hanging
around out front?</i>

43:17.554 --> 43:19.389
There's a police car.

43:21.600 --> 43:22.601
<i>What's going on?</i>

43:22.684 --> 43:23.685
<i>I'm sorry about this.</i>

43:23.769 --> 43:24.978
<i>I know this is a lot,</i>

43:25.062 --> 43:26.647
but we felt like
it would be best

43:26.730 --> 43:28.273
if we didn't go home
as a precaution,

43:28.357 --> 43:29.316
and I agree with him.

43:29.399 --> 43:31.110
I know there's nothing to worry
about, but I agree with him.

43:31.193 --> 43:33.487
<i>I think you should just go to
Dena's for a little while,</i>

43:33.570 --> 43:36.406
<i>just for a few hours, and I'll
call you in a little bit.</i>

43:38.200 --> 43:39.868
<i>And we'll get together, okay?</i>

43:47.876 --> 43:48.961
Okay, I'll go.

43:53.173 --> 43:55.634
<i>Okay. I love you. I'll talk
to you soon, all right?</i>

43:55.717 --> 43:58.053
<i>Don't worry. Okay, bye.</i>

44:21.451 --> 44:23.162
She know what you do
for a living?

44:29.209 --> 44:32.671
The girl on the phone.
It was a girl, wasn't it?

44:34.089 --> 44:36.842
Maybe it was a guy,
I don't know.

44:36.925 --> 44:38.135
I don't judge.

44:43.557 --> 44:47.186
You can't expect to have a real
relationship in our line of work, Matthew.

44:49.980 --> 44:51.106
Don't worry. She's not
going to leave you.

44:51.190 --> 44:55.027
See, what happens is, you try
to protect her with lies,

44:55.110 --> 44:56.695
and then it starts to add up.

44:58.989 --> 45:01.033
At the safe house you said that
they'd kill me to get to you.

45:01.116 --> 45:02.576
After a while,
even the truth...

45:02.618 --> 45:04.912
Why? ...Starts to
sound like a lie.

45:06.205 --> 45:08.373
You have something. You got something
that they want. What is it?

45:08.457 --> 45:09.458
Is she a local?

45:09.541 --> 45:10.542
Don't worry about her.
What is it?

45:10.626 --> 45:12.127
Oh, it is a girl.

45:25.057 --> 45:28.560
You'll keep covering your
tracks, she'll keep believing.

45:28.644 --> 45:31.772
Because she wants to,
because she needs to.

45:33.398 --> 45:36.985
That's why we exist, you
and me, that's our job.

45:37.986 --> 45:39.655
To take advantage of that.

45:39.738 --> 45:43.825
People's desire to believe.

45:44.493 --> 45:45.744
To trust.

45:55.671 --> 45:57.756
She's not going to
leave you, Matthew.

46:00.717 --> 46:02.469
You're going to leave her.

46:08.976 --> 46:10.602
I'm not you.

46:26.868 --> 46:28.370
Correct, sir.
We verified it.

46:50.225 --> 46:52.853
That is your boy.
You take it.

46:55.897 --> 46:57.107
Everybody, stand by.

46:58.191 --> 46:59.776
Matty, it's me.

47:01.153 --> 47:02.154
<i>How are you holding up?</i>

47:03.572 --> 47:04.573
I'm all right.

47:08.785 --> 47:12.873
Matt, we can't get another
team in for at least 12 hours.

47:14.291 --> 47:15.375
<i>Sorry.</i>

47:16.626 --> 47:19.338
We've cleared a new safe house
for you outside the city.

47:19.671 --> 47:21.131
There's a Go-Bag located

47:21.214 --> 47:25.927
at locker number 256, Green Point
Stadium Metrorail station.

47:26.219 --> 47:30.015
<i>The combination
is 2-5-1-22.</i>

47:30.098 --> 47:31.558
2-5-1 -22.

47:31.641 --> 47:33.727
Now, the bag's got a GPS in it.

47:33.810 --> 47:35.270
It'll direct you
to the safe house.

47:35.604 --> 47:38.398
<i>But you got to be careful,
it's an active location.</i>

47:38.482 --> 47:40.484
<i>So, approach with caution.</i>

47:44.780 --> 47:45.781
Matt?

47:47.866 --> 47:50.994
Do you know how
they found Frost?

47:51.078 --> 47:52.454
Do you know who led them to us?

47:55.499 --> 47:56.792
We're working on that.

47:57.751 --> 47:59.586
We're counting on you, Matt.

47:59.961 --> 48:02.464
Get Frost to that safe house and
you can write your own ticket.

48:04.591 --> 48:05.842
I will

48:08.470 --> 48:09.596
<i>I Will.</i>

48:19.439 --> 48:20.565
Left at the light.

48:21.066 --> 48:22.984
To the stadium?

48:23.068 --> 48:24.277
Yeah.

48:48.135 --> 48:49.761
Hey, scarf.
How much for a scarf?

48:51.138 --> 48:52.431
Only fifty rand.

48:52.514 --> 48:53.640
Thanks.

48:56.184 --> 48:57.185
Cuff your hands together.

48:57.269 --> 48:58.353
Together?
Yeah.

49:08.363 --> 49:09.364
Out.

49:14.035 --> 49:16.079
Are you sure you don't
want to just walk away from this?

49:16.163 --> 49:17.122
Can't do that.

49:17.205 --> 49:18.498
Yes, you can.
You should.

49:21.960 --> 49:25.130
Move. Go.
Across the street.

49:36.808 --> 49:40.812
Going to the game.
I like games.

49:41.062 --> 49:42.230
Metrorail, straight ahead.

49:42.314 --> 49:43.315
Straight ahead.

49:53.408 --> 49:54.409
Right over there.

50:14.679 --> 50:15.680
Let's go.

50:39.329 --> 50:41.540
Help! Help! He's
trying to kidnap me!

50:41.623 --> 50:42.624
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

50:42.707 --> 50:44.960
He's trying to
kidnap me! Help!

50:45.043 --> 50:46.211
He's got a gun!

50:48.421 --> 50:50.549
He's got a gun! He's
got a gun right there!

50:52.133 --> 50:54.469
I'm undercover.
I'm undercover!

50:54.553 --> 50:56.721
Calm down, sir.
Everybody, calm down!

51:07.065 --> 51:08.567
Get down! Get down!

51:09.401 --> 51:12.028
All right! Okay!

51:28.962 --> 51:30.338
Get him up. Get up.

51:30.797 --> 51:31.923
Ow, ow, ow!

51:35.802 --> 51:39.848
I'm an American citizen. I don't
know what he wanted from me.

51:41.850 --> 51:43.018
Just calm down.

52:08.001 --> 52:10.587
Hey, hey, hey. I'm a police officer.
I'm from America.

52:10.670 --> 52:13.048
I arrested this man.
His name is Tobin Frost.

52:13.131 --> 52:14.299
Where did you take him?

52:14.382 --> 52:16.217
He's in the infirmary.

52:21.723 --> 52:23.433
There, there!
Is that it?

52:23.516 --> 52:27.395
Top left, second screen from the top!
Look, look, the infirmary.

52:30.732 --> 52:32.150
Right. Go back.

52:42.077 --> 52:44.204
Third-tier infirmary,
now! Move!

52:44.371 --> 52:46.247
Third-tier infirmary.
Go, now!

52:48.208 --> 52:49.209
Do you see?

53:22.617 --> 53:23.576
Don't move.

54:37.609 --> 54:38.651
Frost!

54:41.571 --> 54:42.572
Frost!

54:45.366 --> 54:46.409
Frost!

54:46.618 --> 54:47.660
Hey!

54:49.245 --> 54:50.663
Stop! Stop!

54:52.916 --> 54:54.042
Get out the way!

54:54.334 --> 54:55.376
Stop!

55:02.217 --> 55:03.426
No! Stop!

55:20.193 --> 55:21.236
Medic!

55:47.095 --> 55:48.263
Drop the gun.

55:49.097 --> 55:50.181
Drop it.

55:50.265 --> 55:52.100
I'm responsible for you.

55:55.770 --> 55:57.105
You're responsible
for yourself.

56:01.317 --> 56:02.443
Get on your knees.

56:14.372 --> 56:15.832
Are you going to kill me?

56:28.052 --> 56:29.888
I only kill professionals.

56:49.449 --> 56:51.367
<i>Height, approximately six feet.</i>

56:51.451 --> 56:54.078
<i>Anglo, wearing
a stadium security jacket.</i>

56:54.162 --> 56:57.415
<i>The suspect was last seen entering
Green Point Stadium Metrorail,</i>

56:57.498 --> 56:59.626
<i>stadium concourse.</i>

57:09.636 --> 57:12.263
Sir, we have a thread on what Frost
might be doing in Cape Town.

57:14.307 --> 57:15.808
Can you bring up...

57:16.976 --> 57:19.771
Alec Wade.
Fifteen-year NOC at MI6.

57:19.854 --> 57:23.107
Sabotage, counter-ambush,
counter-IED tactics,

57:23.191 --> 57:25.234
until he blew up an op
in Lisbon four years ago

57:25.318 --> 57:26.778
and was put on a desk,
pushing papers.

57:26.861 --> 57:29.113
Cape Town Police found him
shot through the head,

57:29.197 --> 57:32.033
high-powered rifle, 14
blocks from the consulate.

57:32.116 --> 57:34.452
Witnesses placed someone
fitting Frost's description

57:34.535 --> 57:35.995
in the car at the time
of the shooting.

57:36.079 --> 57:38.456
And we think, what? That
they were working together?

57:38.539 --> 57:41.459
They ran joint operations
in Hamburg in the mid-'80s.

57:41.834 --> 57:44.671
Frost's last sighting
was in Hamburg, 2011.

57:45.546 --> 57:47.131
And what are the Brits
saying about Wade?

57:47.215 --> 57:48.967
Officially,
they're saying nothing.

57:49.050 --> 57:50.093
Unofficially?

57:50.176 --> 57:52.428
He's been the subject of a
five-month internal investigation.

57:52.553 --> 57:54.180
They think he's
been trading intel.

57:54.263 --> 57:55.306
Hmm.

57:55.390 --> 57:57.475
So what the hell
did Wade leak to Frost

57:57.558 --> 58:00.728
that was so important it was
worth killing six of our men?

58:03.523 --> 58:07.819
I want more details from MI6.
Call in every chit you got.

58:07.902 --> 58:08.945
Yes, sir.

58:09.028 --> 58:11.322
David, I want
an internal investigation

58:11.406 --> 58:14.117
into Daniel Kiefer
and his team.

58:58.161 --> 59:00.288
I've got Weston calling in
for David Barlow.

59:04.292 --> 59:05.585
<i>I lost him.</i>

59:05.668 --> 59:07.045
<i>Frost?</i>

59:07.128 --> 59:08.421
<i>Yeah, he's gone.</i>

59:08.963 --> 59:10.965
After I picked up the GPS,
he created a diversion,

59:11.049 --> 59:12.717
took out a couple of cops
at the stadium.

59:12.800 --> 59:14.177
Any idea where he's headed?

59:14.260 --> 59:15.636
<i>Not exactly, but I will.</i>

59:15.720 --> 59:18.056
This is Linklater. You
said he took out two cops?

59:18.139 --> 59:19.849
Matt, you're on speaker.

59:21.434 --> 59:24.312
Yes, ma'am.
At the Green Point Stadium.

59:24.395 --> 59:26.731
<i>...involvement
in a possible kidnapping.</i>

59:26.814 --> 59:29.776
<i>The suspect is being described
as a white male of medium build.</i>

59:29.859 --> 59:32.153
Stadium police is
reporting you shot a cop.

59:32.236 --> 59:34.322
<i>I returned fire
in self-defense.</i>

59:34.822 --> 59:37.325
The fact of the matter is,
Frost is on the loose.

59:37.492 --> 59:39.410
<i>I've spent the last
14 hours with him.</i>

59:39.494 --> 59:41.829
<i>He might have said or done something
that could lead me to him.</i>

59:41.913 --> 59:45.583
You are to stand down,
proceed to the consulate,

59:45.666 --> 59:47.960
and present yourself for exfil and debrief.
Acknowledge.

59:48.169 --> 59:50.463
By the time I'm debriefed,
Frost will be gone.

59:50.546 --> 59:52.048
<i>I've spent 12
months researching</i>

59:52.131 --> 59:53.299
<i>every square inch of this town.</i>

59:53.382 --> 59:56.094
<i>I will find Frost
and I'll deliver him.</i>

59:56.177 --> 59:58.596
Weston, this is
Harlan Whitford, son.

01:00:01.599 --> 01:00:05.186
Now, you've done a fine job,
but we'll take it from here.

01:00:10.858 --> 01:00:12.193
Understood.

01:00:33.214 --> 01:00:34.298
<i>Hello.</i>

01:00:34.382 --> 01:00:35.800
Sir, I respectfully
request that,

01:00:35.883 --> 01:00:37.218
that exchange not
make it onto his files.

01:00:37.385 --> 01:00:39.762
He's either incompetent or he's
working with somebody else.

01:00:39.846 --> 01:00:41.347
Do not make this about Weston.

01:00:41.514 --> 01:00:42.890
It was your guys
that lost Frost.

01:00:42.974 --> 01:00:44.642
It was your team that
folded at the safe house.

01:00:44.725 --> 01:00:47.895
I want both of you on an
airplane to Cape Town.

01:00:48.396 --> 01:00:52.567
Frost is trying to get out of the country.
Go find his ass.

01:01:24.765 --> 01:01:26.434
There you go, baby.

01:01:32.899 --> 01:01:34.275
One ticket to Jo'burg.

01:01:43.576 --> 01:01:44.577
Thank you.

01:02:19.654 --> 01:02:23.324
<i>Police had detained
American NGO worker Matthew Weston</i>

01:02:23.407 --> 01:02:26.160
<i>as a possible suspect
in the shooting.</i>

01:02:26.327 --> 01:02:28.871
<i>Weston had been
detained earlier today,</i>

01:02:28.955 --> 01:02:33.542
<i>but managed to escape while being
questioned by stadium security officials</i>

01:02:33.668 --> 01:02:36.212

01:02:47.890 --> 01:02:49.100
Baby.

01:02:51.519 --> 01:02:52.895
Are you all right?

01:03:10.579 --> 01:03:12.081
I lied to you.

01:03:15.876 --> 01:03:18.004
About everything.
The NGO, Parker.

01:03:19.255 --> 01:03:20.256
My Job.

01:03:21.841 --> 01:03:22.967
My family.

01:03:25.970 --> 01:03:27.972
So, who do you work for?

01:03:33.352 --> 01:03:34.562
The government.

01:03:37.398 --> 01:03:38.399
CIA.

01:03:38.691 --> 01:03:40.192
No, I don't...

01:03:41.193 --> 01:03:42.194
I don't do anything.

01:03:42.361 --> 01:03:46.365
I sit around in an apartment all day.
I answer the phone.

01:03:59.337 --> 01:04:01.422
I need you to leave.

01:04:02.173 --> 01:04:05.092
I need you to do that
for me. Okay?

01:04:11.098 --> 01:04:12.141
Here.

01:04:14.268 --> 01:04:15.895
This is a ticket to Jo'burg.

01:04:16.937 --> 01:04:18.230
When you get there, you go
straight to the airport.

01:04:18.314 --> 01:04:19.940
There's a 6:00 a.m. flight
to Paris.

01:04:20.775 --> 01:04:21.817
Take this.

01:04:22.443 --> 01:04:23.986
You take this.
If anyone stops you...

01:04:24.070 --> 01:04:26.906
If anyone stops you...
If anybody stops you...

01:04:26.989 --> 01:04:28.532
Who do you think I am?

01:04:28.616 --> 01:04:29.742
Stop, stop.

01:04:29.825 --> 01:04:30.868
Fuck you!

01:04:30.951 --> 01:04:33.662
Hey, stop. Stop it.

01:04:40.836 --> 01:04:44.715
We broke up a week ago. You
haven't seen me since, okay?

01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:52.640
I'm sorry.

01:04:59.146 --> 01:05:02.316
Just leave. Please?

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:07.446
Do you love me?

01:05:07.530 --> 01:05:08.781
Very much.

01:05:09.949 --> 01:05:11.867
Go. Go.

01:05:18.499 --> 01:05:19.625
Go.

01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:45.443
<i>Attention, all passengers,</i>

01:05:45.526 --> 01:05:48.112
<i>Platform 20 for Langa Township</i>

01:05:48.195 --> 01:05:50.197
<i>departing in five minutes.</i>

01:05:52.366 --> 01:05:55.369
<i>Langa Township,
departing in five minutes.</i>

01:06:19.602 --> 01:06:22.813
Sir. Someone just logged into our
system using Weston's password

01:06:22.897 --> 01:06:25.065
accessing his stored files.

01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:28.903
It's him. What
the hell is he doing?

01:06:29.737 --> 01:06:30.946
I'm not sure.

01:06:31.030 --> 01:06:32.239
I want to see
what he's looking at.

01:06:36.452 --> 01:06:37.620
<i>He's pulled an old report</i>

01:06:37.703 --> 01:06:41.040
on surveillance targets living
in the Langa Township area.

01:06:43.292 --> 01:06:46.921
<i>It's a profile of Carlos
Villar, a Nicaraguan national.</i>

01:06:47.087 --> 01:06:49.215
He's a known document forger.

01:06:49.298 --> 01:06:51.175
Get me a copy
of Weston's report.

01:06:51.258 --> 01:06:52.301
RICHARDS; Yes, sir.

01:06:53.052 --> 01:06:54.136
Logged off, sir.
He's gone.

01:06:54.595 --> 01:06:56.388
An Internet café
on Long Street.

01:07:23.958 --> 01:07:25.334
Like a black Dorian Gray.

01:07:25.417 --> 01:07:27.503
That's right.
How you doing, brother?

01:07:28.754 --> 01:07:30.172
Come in.
Yes, sir.

01:07:35.678 --> 01:07:36.679
Illana?

01:07:37.471 --> 01:07:38.472
Hi.

01:07:38.556 --> 01:07:40.057
We have a guest.

01:07:41.850 --> 01:07:43.394
Illana.
Good to meet you.

01:07:43.477 --> 01:07:45.062
Joseph, my daughter.

01:07:45.563 --> 01:07:47.439
- How are you?
- Hello.

01:07:47.523 --> 01:07:48.524
My son-in-law.

01:07:51.402 --> 01:07:52.945
May I offer you some tea?

01:07:53.487 --> 01:07:55.197
No, we're going upstairs.

01:08:07.835 --> 01:08:09.336
I remembered.

01:08:11.422 --> 01:08:12.881
You even let it breathe.

01:08:17.845 --> 01:08:21.557
"Too long a sacrifice Can
make a stone of the heart"

01:08:24.685 --> 01:08:26.895
"O when may it suffice?"

01:08:27.938 --> 01:08:30.189
"That is Heaven's part"

01:08:35.112 --> 01:08:36.822
In the old days, a cheap bottle

01:08:36.904 --> 01:08:38.948
of Flor de Cana kept us
happy all night.

01:08:39.198 --> 01:08:41.535
Mmm. Tastes change.

01:08:45.581 --> 01:08:47.082
People change.

01:08:52.212 --> 01:08:54.173
People don't change.

01:08:55.424 --> 01:08:57.176
We grow old.

01:08:57.259 --> 01:08:59.678
And some of us adapt.

01:09:01.013 --> 01:09:03.557
And learn how to enjoy
simple pleasures of life,

01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:07.770
like a family, a home.

01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:10.189
And for you...

01:09:10.731 --> 01:09:12.983
What's in that glass
right now, for you,

01:09:13.067 --> 01:09:15.444
is as good as it's
ever going to be.

01:09:18.072 --> 01:09:21.158
One day you'll understand.

01:09:21.241 --> 01:09:24.787
You got more past
than future, you learn.

01:09:27.038 --> 01:09:28.540
What is this?
An intervention?

01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:36.340
I thought you were dead.

01:09:50.895 --> 01:09:53.357
So, what brings you to my home
in the middle of the night

01:09:53.439 --> 01:09:54.900
after all these years?

01:10:09.498 --> 01:10:10.666
Ooh.

01:10:16.797 --> 01:10:17.798
Papa?

01:10:18.298 --> 01:10:19.341
Uh-huh.

01:10:19.425 --> 01:10:20.801
We're going.

01:10:21.301 --> 01:10:22.386
Okay, be careful.

01:10:22.469 --> 01:10:23.971
Okay, Papa.

01:10:43.741 --> 01:10:45.534
What are you
going to do with this?

01:10:46.452 --> 01:10:48.412
Make some money.

01:10:48.662 --> 01:10:49.788
Let me borrow your glasses.

01:10:57.296 --> 01:10:58.589
That's it. Listen.

01:10:58.672 --> 01:11:03.177
I'm going to need a new passport,
photo ID, driver's license,

01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:05.804
the whole shebang.
Can you do that for me?

01:11:06.972 --> 01:11:08.056
Yeah.

01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:11.143
You sure?

01:11:12.352 --> 01:11:13.395
Yes.

01:11:20.694 --> 01:11:22.738
Weston never
showed at the consulate.

01:11:22.821 --> 01:11:25.240
And he was just
accessing our secure server,

01:11:25.324 --> 01:11:28.118
searching for someone
to create an alias package.

01:11:29.870 --> 01:11:32.664
<i>He's trying to
leave the country.</i>

01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:34.875
Or he's going after Frost.

01:11:35.834 --> 01:11:38.212
<i>Look at what
happened at the soccer stadium.</i>

01:11:38.712 --> 01:11:40.756
<i>This guy let Frost escape.</i>

01:11:44.009 --> 01:11:45.969
I think Weston's turned.

01:11:46.053 --> 01:11:47.638
I know this boy.

01:11:48.305 --> 01:11:51.225
<i>He's been looking for a
chance to prove himself.</i>

01:11:51.308 --> 01:11:53.560
<i>He's trying to bring in Frost.</i>

01:11:55.354 --> 01:11:56.688
<i>Come on, David.</i>

01:11:56.772 --> 01:11:58.857
You're not seeing the evidence.

01:12:10.661 --> 01:12:12.246
Not my best work.

01:12:12.454 --> 01:12:15.749
But given the pressure
of time, it's passable.

01:12:16.583 --> 01:12:17.918
It's good.
I'll wire you the money

01:12:18.001 --> 01:12:19.419
as soon as I get out of town.

01:12:19.503 --> 01:12:24.091
Tobin, don't do this.
It's different.

01:12:24.758 --> 01:12:27.553
You don't need the trouble,
you don't need the money.

01:12:27.761 --> 01:12:29.471
You can give it...

01:12:49.616 --> 01:12:50.576
Carlos!

01:12:50.659 --> 01:12:52.077
Illana!

01:12:52.286 --> 01:12:53.412
Carlos!

01:12:53.495 --> 01:12:54.621
Illana!

01:12:58.876 --> 01:12:59.918
Carlos.

01:13:01.962 --> 01:13:03.005
Carlos!

01:13:12.347 --> 01:13:13.473
Go.

01:13:14.308 --> 01:13:15.475
Go.

01:13:28.322 --> 01:13:29.323
He's on the roof!

01:14:29.925 --> 01:14:30.926
Go! Go!

01:15:56.970 --> 01:15:58.472
Get in the car!

01:16:28.210 --> 01:16:30.670
They think they can
come at me like this.

01:16:30.754 --> 01:16:32.589
Have to do it a whole
lot better than that.

01:16:38.512 --> 01:16:39.554
Shit!

01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:54.653
Matt, how'd you find me?

01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:56.738
It wasn't that hard.

01:17:14.089 --> 01:17:15.382
Let's go.

01:17:42.701 --> 01:17:43.869
Wait, wait, wait.

01:19:56.876 --> 01:19:58.962
Who do you work for?

01:20:18.064 --> 01:20:19.065
Who sent you?

01:20:20.942 --> 01:20:23.695
Who sent you?
Who sent you?

01:20:25.322 --> 01:20:26.323
Who?

01:20:26.948 --> 01:20:28.033
Vargas.

01:20:28.283 --> 01:20:29.284
Vargas.

01:20:29.701 --> 01:20:30.785
Who's Vargas?

01:20:31.202 --> 01:20:32.412
Who's Vargas?

01:20:36.166 --> 01:20:37.709
You want to die?

01:20:41.796 --> 01:20:43.256
Who's Vargas?

01:20:47.469 --> 01:20:48.720
Matt.

01:20:55.894 --> 01:20:57.645
CIA.

01:20:59.606 --> 01:21:02.984
CIA! CIA!

01:21:32.514 --> 01:21:33.556
Report?

01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:35.475
There was a shootout
in the Langa Township.

01:21:36.101 --> 01:21:39.104
Two crime scenes. One at the
residence of Carlos Villar.

01:21:39.187 --> 01:21:40.730
He's a document forger.

01:21:40.814 --> 01:21:42.399
The other in a nearby tenement.

01:21:42.482 --> 01:21:43.608
And where was Frost last seen?

01:21:43.691 --> 01:21:44.818
Tenement.

01:21:45.693 --> 01:21:46.820
Have fun at Villar's.

01:21:46.903 --> 01:21:48.488
We'll meet up later.

01:22:08.716 --> 01:22:10.718
You were right about Ana.

01:22:12.846 --> 01:22:14.431
That's her name.

01:22:17.016 --> 01:22:18.393
<i>Sorry to hear that.</i>

01:22:20.728 --> 01:22:25.400
Most case officers get
married three, four times.

01:22:27.527 --> 01:22:29.195
You?

01:22:31.906 --> 01:22:33.533
Once.

01:22:45.628 --> 01:22:47.714
You're falling apart over here.

01:22:55.555 --> 01:22:58.224
Don't kill innocent people,
Matthew.

01:23:00.935 --> 01:23:02.145
What?

01:23:07.775 --> 01:23:12.655
Air traffic controller,
a tiny airstrip in Bermuda.

01:23:12.739 --> 01:23:16.242
George Edwart Cox,
I remember that name.

01:23:16.326 --> 01:23:18.203
Edwart, With a "T".

01:23:19.287 --> 01:23:24.083
My inside officer said he was
organizing arms shipments,

01:23:24.167 --> 01:23:27.962
but he was just an air traffic controller.
He was just a guy.

01:23:28.588 --> 01:23:30.715
I put a bullet in his skull.

01:23:33.927 --> 01:23:37.138
Black Ops came in, they replaced
him with one of their own,

01:23:37.305 --> 01:23:39.516
and crashed a Gulf stream
in the ocean that night.

01:23:39.599 --> 01:23:43.311
The thing was, the family
that was on the plane...

01:23:44.437 --> 01:23:47.815
The husband,
he was a whistleblower.

01:23:48.983 --> 01:23:51.694
The whole thing was about

01:23:51.778 --> 01:23:55.323
stopping him from
testifying about wet works

01:23:56.449 --> 01:23:58.576
to a congressional hearing.

01:24:01.788 --> 01:24:03.414
Is that why you left?

01:24:03.498 --> 01:24:04.666
No.

01:24:06.668 --> 01:24:10.421
I went back to work the next day
like nothing ever happened.

01:24:13.383 --> 01:24:16.553
You practice anything a long
time, you get good at it.

01:24:16.636 --> 01:24:20.223
You tell a hundred lies a day,
it sounds like the truth.

01:24:20.306 --> 01:24:22.642
Everyone betrays everyone.

01:24:25.395 --> 01:24:27.730
That's a shitty excuse.

01:24:29.691 --> 01:24:32.443
Yeah, I used to be
innocent like you.

01:24:32.527 --> 01:24:35.321
Wrap myself up in the flag...

01:24:42.704 --> 01:24:44.664
I'm going to take you in.

01:24:53.298 --> 01:24:54.841
Good for you.

01:25:49.062 --> 01:25:50.146
Barlow.

01:25:50.229 --> 01:25:52.106
<i>Witnesses
identified a pair of men</i>

01:25:52.190 --> 01:25:53.983
<i>fitting Weston and
Frost's description</i>

01:25:54.067 --> 01:25:56.110
leaving this location together.

01:25:56.277 --> 01:25:57.487
So, he pulled it off.

01:25:57.570 --> 01:26:00.448
Weston is aiding and
abetting a fugitive.

01:26:00.782 --> 01:26:01.949
<i>You're wrong.</i>

01:26:02.033 --> 01:26:04.619
If he's with Frost, he's
taking him to the safe house.

01:26:04.702 --> 01:26:06.496
That's where we got to be.

01:26:06.954 --> 01:26:08.539
Fine. Fine.

01:26:08.706 --> 01:26:11.417
Meet me at the crossroads
at Old Malmesbury Road.

01:26:38.486 --> 01:26:39.862
Who are you?

01:26:40.738 --> 01:26:41.989
You Weston?

01:26:43.658 --> 01:26:45.243
Give me the shotgun.

01:26:45.326 --> 01:26:46.911
What the hell is this?

01:26:46.994 --> 01:26:48.079
Who are you?

01:26:48.579 --> 01:26:50.873
I'm Keller.
Safe house keeper.

01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:54.627
Authorization Index, Bravo
Four Seven Oscar Whiskey Six.

01:26:55.253 --> 01:26:57.630
Inside. Let's go.

01:27:07.140 --> 01:27:08.975
To the left.

01:27:11.602 --> 01:27:12.854
Slowly.

01:27:13.563 --> 01:27:15.565
I don't know who trained you,
man, but this sure as hell

01:27:15.648 --> 01:27:17.400
ain't protocol.
Where's the guest room?

01:27:18.317 --> 01:27:20.486
That's the thing, we
don't really have one.

01:27:21.529 --> 01:27:24.449
In there. In there.

01:27:28.369 --> 01:27:31.164
Cuff him.
To the pipe.

01:27:38.755 --> 01:27:39.964
Out. Over there.

01:27:40.423 --> 01:27:41.883
All right.

01:27:44.469 --> 01:27:45.511
Control room.

01:27:47.138 --> 01:27:49.682
Whatever you say, man.
It's your rodeo.

01:28:01.027 --> 01:28:02.570
Call it in.
Let me hear it.

01:28:12.663 --> 01:28:13.790
<i>Landlord</i>

01:28:13.873 --> 01:28:15.917
My guest is here.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:17.043
<i>Account?</i>

01:28:17.126 --> 01:28:18.336
Abaresque Limited.

01:28:20.046 --> 01:28:21.088
<i>With a guest?</i>

01:28:21.172 --> 01:28:22.340
Yeah, package delivered.

01:28:24.091 --> 01:28:27.178
<i>Confirmed.
Pickup scheduled.</i>

01:28:27.762 --> 01:28:29.472
They're on the way.

01:28:32.099 --> 01:28:34.393
Can we at least
put the gun down now?

01:28:42.777 --> 01:28:45.279
Thanks, Clayton. Bye.

01:28:47.114 --> 01:28:48.908
It's a microchip.

01:28:49.492 --> 01:28:50.743
What?

01:28:51.452 --> 01:28:52.870
That was my guy from MI6.

01:28:52.954 --> 01:28:54.413
Wade got his hands
on a microchip.

01:28:54.580 --> 01:28:55.748
And what was on it?

01:28:55.832 --> 01:28:57.041
Only Wade knew,

01:28:57.124 --> 01:28:58.501
but I think it's safe to assume

01:28:58.584 --> 01:28:59.669
that's why he
hooked up with Frost.

01:28:59.752 --> 01:29:01.254
To sell it.

01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:03.923
Let's get moving.

01:29:36.956 --> 01:29:38.457
Long day, huh?

01:29:44.422 --> 01:29:47.174
I can only imagine.
Tobin Frost.

01:29:48.634 --> 01:29:50.428
That man's a legend.

01:29:51.262 --> 01:29:52.722
I hope you picked up something.

01:29:52.805 --> 01:29:55.099
You ain't going to
find a better education.

01:30:04.358 --> 01:30:07.320
This is the most
excitement I've seen.

01:30:07.403 --> 01:30:09.906
You're the first guest
I've had in 10 months.

01:30:10.573 --> 01:30:12.950
But you wouldn't know
anything about that, right?

01:30:13.034 --> 01:30:14.827
You got a city posting.

01:30:15.494 --> 01:30:18.915
Yeah, nightlife, beaches.

01:30:18.998 --> 01:30:21.667
Little ladies
running around everywhere.

01:30:23.878 --> 01:30:25.212
Yeah.

01:30:27.173 --> 01:30:29.008
I'm jealous.

01:30:35.348 --> 01:30:36.641
You got coffee?

01:30:36.724 --> 01:30:38.392
Yeah, it's in the cupboard.

01:30:38.476 --> 01:30:39.518
Where?

01:30:39.602 --> 01:30:41.562
Want me to get it?
I got it.

01:34:00.970 --> 01:34:03.180
Why are you in Cape Town?

01:34:06.142 --> 01:34:08.769
Tell me now. Why?

01:34:15.317 --> 01:34:17.236
What is it?

01:34:17.319 --> 01:34:20.531
A dirt list, laundry list.

01:34:20.614 --> 01:34:24.785
Israeli Intelligence, five years
ago, compiled blackmail intel.

01:34:25.744 --> 01:34:29.790
Corrupt agents,
German Intelligence, MI6...

01:34:29.874 --> 01:34:30.916
CIA?

01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:32.710
Yes.

01:34:33.919 --> 01:34:35.546
We got to get away.

01:34:36.881 --> 01:34:39.300
We got to get out of here.

01:34:48.100 --> 01:34:49.101
Ah, shit.

01:35:05.618 --> 01:35:07.870
Don't, don't, don't.

01:35:14.126 --> 01:35:17.171
No, don't leave me here,
please.

01:35:17.296 --> 01:35:18.881
Don't do it.

01:36:04.009 --> 01:36:05.094
Matt?

01:36:08.138 --> 01:36:09.390
Hey.

01:36:12.184 --> 01:36:13.686
How you doing?

01:36:20.150 --> 01:36:21.527
I'm proud of you.

01:36:24.655 --> 01:36:26.615
And what you pulled off.

01:36:29.118 --> 01:36:32.454
You're going to make
a hell of a case officer.

01:36:34.456 --> 01:36:36.250
Where's Frost?

01:36:36.583 --> 01:36:37.960
He's gone.

01:36:40.587 --> 01:36:45.134
Place is a wreck.
Blood everywhere.

01:36:46.010 --> 01:36:47.594
Was he injured or...

01:36:51.682 --> 01:36:54.435
I guess you know
he killed Keller.

01:36:55.436 --> 01:36:56.562
No.

01:36:58.731 --> 01:37:00.357
I killed Keller.

01:37:08.824 --> 01:37:11.076
Frost killed Keller.

01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:15.456
He killed Linklater, too.

01:37:18.792 --> 01:37:22.504
Did he talk about anything?
Anything he was after?

01:37:24.131 --> 01:37:25.591
Anything he might have had?

01:37:27.009 --> 01:37:28.260
The file.

01:37:29.178 --> 01:37:30.554
The file?

01:37:32.348 --> 01:37:34.183
The file that you're on.

01:37:39.563 --> 01:37:41.273
Along with a lot
of other people.

01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:43.108
Important people.

01:37:55.454 --> 01:37:56.455
Listen to me.

01:37:57.414 --> 01:37:59.666
What would you do

01:37:59.750 --> 01:38:02.378
if someone is
watching your every move?

01:38:03.670 --> 01:38:06.423
Some maybe you're not proud of.

01:38:06.507 --> 01:38:09.968
And you will have some you're
not proud of, believe me.

01:38:10.052 --> 01:38:12.596
And then tries to
use it against you?

01:38:15.182 --> 01:38:17.351
You would do
what you have to do.

01:38:18.227 --> 01:38:20.646
You would do
what you have to do.

01:38:27.569 --> 01:38:29.238
Where's the file?

01:38:36.995 --> 01:38:40.082
Matt, the file.
Where is the file?

01:38:42.751 --> 01:38:44.128
You're a dead man.

01:38:45.003 --> 01:38:46.463
Yeah, a long time now.

01:38:46.713 --> 01:38:48.382
Frost is here.

01:40:51.171 --> 01:40:52.506
Let's go.

01:41:15.445 --> 01:41:17.030
We got him.

01:41:19.324 --> 01:41:20.492
A hell of a job.

01:41:55.986 --> 01:41:57.362
You smell that?

01:41:57.904 --> 01:42:00.616
Pinotage. It's a good grape.
Great wine.

01:42:00.699 --> 01:42:04.745
Local grape.
Pinotage is great...

01:42:12.419 --> 01:42:14.838
I don't want you
losing this one.

01:42:15.380 --> 01:42:18.300
It's worth a lot of money.

01:42:21.595 --> 01:42:24.056
You're a good boy, Matty.

01:42:26.433 --> 01:42:28.101
You know what you are.

01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:32.814
Hey.

01:42:33.815 --> 01:42:35.734
I know what you're not.

01:42:39.905 --> 01:42:42.074
You're better than me.

01:42:45.911 --> 01:42:50.624
No, it's okay,
just be better than me.

01:42:55.337 --> 01:42:57.089
You promise me.

01:42:58.507 --> 01:42:59.758
Yeah.

01:43:05.389 --> 01:43:07.683
Well, let's...

01:43:10.018 --> 01:43:11.728
Let's go.

01:43:13.105 --> 01:43:16.608
I just got to get up.
I need to get up.

01:43:18.860 --> 01:43:19.945
Stay.

01:43:22.698 --> 01:43:23.865
Stay.

01:43:26.952 --> 01:43:28.203
Hey...

01:44:44.613 --> 01:44:48.116
That's exactly as it happened.

01:44:52.788 --> 01:44:54.498
Obviously, this situation needs

01:44:54.581 --> 01:44:56.833
to be handled with a
certain amount of finesse.

01:44:57.334 --> 01:44:58.960
Has anybody else
seen this report?

01:44:59.044 --> 01:45:00.962
No, sir. Not yet.

01:45:02.297 --> 01:45:03.924
Matt, I'm sure this
comes as no surprise,

01:45:04.007 --> 01:45:08.637
but parts of this report are going to
have to be altered for national security.

01:45:09.971 --> 01:45:11.389
Which parts, sir?

01:45:11.473 --> 01:45:12.891
Well...

01:45:13.475 --> 01:45:15.519
David Barlow can't
be held responsible

01:45:15.602 --> 01:45:17.479
for what happened
to the safe house.

01:45:18.313 --> 01:45:20.899
We just don't need the scandal.

01:45:20.982 --> 01:45:23.485
But, sir, you and I both know
that, that is just not the truth.

01:45:23.568 --> 01:45:26.154
People don't want
the truth any more, Matt.

01:45:26.238 --> 01:45:29.115
It's too messy.
Keeps them up nights.

01:45:33.370 --> 01:45:35.664
I'll tell you what I am
willing to do, though.

01:45:36.498 --> 01:45:39.584
I think the Agency has
grossly underestimated you,

01:45:39.668 --> 01:45:43.797
and I'm recommending you for a
senior case officer position.

01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:45.382
Provided you still want it.

01:45:46.299 --> 01:45:48.927
That's a generous offer, sir.

01:45:50.053 --> 01:45:53.765
There's just one thing you
need to clarify for me.

01:45:53.849 --> 01:45:55.141
Of course.

01:45:56.226 --> 01:45:59.229
Frost may have been
carrying some vital intel.

01:45:59.312 --> 01:46:00.647
A file.

01:46:01.231 --> 01:46:04.109
I'm not seeing that
anywhere in this report.

01:46:11.533 --> 01:46:13.326
What was on the file, sir?

01:46:13.410 --> 01:46:16.121
Something that, quite frankly,
could be very damaging

01:46:16.204 --> 01:46:18.540
to the Agency
and to our allies.

01:46:21.710 --> 01:46:25.839
I don't see why Frost would even
mention something like that to me.

01:46:31.094 --> 01:46:33.513
No, I suppose he wouldn't,
would he?

01:46:37.893 --> 01:46:41.146
You realize, though,
that if that file did leak,

01:46:42.689 --> 01:46:44.816
what would happen
to the person responsible?

01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:46.902
That person would
be arrested, sir.

01:46:46.985 --> 01:46:48.820
He'd be risking everything.

01:46:49.821 --> 01:46:53.658
He'd have enemies in every
intelligence agency in the world.

01:46:55.285 --> 01:46:58.830
In the eyes of the CIA, he'd
be just like Tobin Frost.

01:47:02.667 --> 01:47:05.587
Frost didn't say anything
about a file, sir.

01:47:10.842 --> 01:47:12.177
All right, son.

01:47:13.303 --> 01:47:14.888
Take a few days off.

01:47:14.971 --> 01:47:16.932
We'll get you
started next week.

01:47:18.767 --> 01:47:20.101
Thank you.

01:47:22.312 --> 01:47:25.273
And think about our
conversation, would you?

01:47:25.523 --> 01:47:27.025
Will do.

01:47:27.108 --> 01:47:29.069
I'll take it from here, sir.

01:47:54.678 --> 01:47:55.929
