03:11.258 --> 03:13.425
And you saw rylan's profile

03:13.427 --> 03:14.993
And she lived in the area?

03:14.995 --> 03:16.361
>> when we first met,

03:16.363 --> 03:17.930
She lived about an hour away

03:17.932 --> 03:19.264
And then she ended up

03:19.266 --> 03:20.799
Moving to the austin area.

03:27.241 --> 03:28.340

03:28.342 --> 03:30.108
But when she moved far away,

03:30.110 --> 03:31.276
We would try to meet up.

03:31.278 --> 03:32.144
She would say

03:32.146 --> 03:33.345
She was getting close

03:33.347 --> 03:35.113
And she would get nervous

03:35.115 --> 03:36.148
And drive back,

03:36.150 --> 03:37.449
And i actually gave her

03:37.451 --> 03:38.750
Gas money for that.

03:38.752 --> 03:39.451
>> whoa, wait a second.

03:39.453 --> 03:40.152
>> that changes things.

03:40.154 --> 03:40.752
>> so hold on.

03:40.754 --> 03:41.620
You sent her how much money?

03:41.622 --> 03:42.287
>> $100.

03:42.289 --> 03:43.021
>> have you sent her money

03:43.023 --> 03:44.089
Any other times?

03:44.091 --> 03:45.490
>> once, in, like,

03:45.492 --> 03:46.425
A birthday card.

03:46.427 --> 03:47.392
>> did she say that she

03:47.394 --> 03:48.393
Received the card?

03:48.395 --> 03:50.596
>> she actually said she got it

03:50.598 --> 03:51.997
But one of her friends

03:51.999 --> 03:53.065
Ripped it up.

03:53.067 --> 03:54.233
>> has it ever crossed your mind

03:54.235 --> 03:56.134
That maybe rylan isn't

03:56.136 --> 03:57.703
Telling you the whole truth?

03:57.705 --> 03:59.238
>> i believe that she is

03:59.240 --> 04:00.339
Who she says she is,

04:00.341 --> 04:01.039
But there is

04:01.041 --> 04:03.041
Just that little chance.

04:03.043 --> 04:03.976
>> have you ever looked her up

04:03.978 --> 04:04.910
On facebook?

04:04.912 --> 04:06.178
>> she doesn't have facebook.

04:06.180 --> 04:07.579
She had tried to make one

04:07.581 --> 04:08.513
And never did.

04:08.515 --> 04:09.514
>> you do have to recognize

04:09.516 --> 04:11.316
That it's odd that in 2015

04:11.318 --> 04:12.484
Someone would be walking around

04:12.486 --> 04:13.652
With no facebook and just

04:13.654 --> 04:14.853
Meetme app on her phone.

04:14.855 --> 04:15.754
>> right.

04:15.756 --> 04:16.454
>> if it were me,

04:16.457 --> 04:17.755
Being the investigative person

04:17.757 --> 04:18.824
I am, i would say,

04:18.826 --> 04:19.958
"can you send me video

04:19.959 --> 04:20.692
Of you saying,

04:20.694 --> 04:22.194
'supercalifragilistic--

04:22.196 --> 04:23.495

04:23.497 --> 04:24.663
I need to just make sure

04:24.665 --> 04:25.430
That this is you."

04:25.432 --> 04:26.098
>> right.

04:26.100 --> 04:26.832
>> but you don't have

04:26.834 --> 04:27.432
That concern?

04:27.434 --> 04:28.533
You're 100% positive

04:28.535 --> 04:30.135
In your heart that that's her?

04:30.137 --> 04:31.303
>> i do believe it is.

04:31.305 --> 04:33.405
>> so you think rylan could be,

04:33.407 --> 04:36.141
Like, wife material?

04:36.143 --> 04:36.808
>> yeah.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.443
I would really like to get

04:38.445 --> 04:39.344
Into that phase

04:39.346 --> 04:40.479
In the relationship.

04:40.481 --> 04:41.580
>> i'm hoping for true love

04:41.582 --> 04:42.514
So bad.

04:42.516 --> 04:43.682
Help is on the way.

04:43.684 --> 04:44.683
>> we'll see you soon, my man.

04:44.685 --> 04:45.350
>> see ya.

04:45.352 --> 04:46.018

06:00.260 --> 06:01.760
Gentlemen, we came here

06:01.762 --> 06:02.894
For a reason.

06:02.896 --> 06:04.396
So, tell us what it is

06:04.398 --> 06:05.397
About this relationship

06:05.399 --> 06:07.132
That's kept you on the hook

06:07.134 --> 06:08.100

06:12.506 --> 06:13.338
She wants to listen

06:13.340 --> 06:14.539
To me, you know--

06:14.541 --> 06:16.108
You know, how my day went

06:16.110 --> 06:17.042
Or stuff like that.

06:17.044 --> 06:17.876
>> do you really feel

06:17.878 --> 06:18.977
Like you're in love with her?

06:18.979 --> 06:20.679
>> i really do feel like i am.

06:20.681 --> 06:21.346
I've never really

06:21.348 --> 06:22.013
Felt it before.

06:22.015 --> 06:23.081
I've never, you know,

06:23.083 --> 06:24.416
Said it to anyone or,

06:24.418 --> 06:25.617
Like, really meant it.

06:25.619 --> 06:28.453
I was always pretty shy, so--

06:28.455 --> 06:29.154
And, i mean,

06:29.156 --> 06:30.522
It was kind of hard.

06:30.524 --> 06:31.256
>> would you say you have

06:31.258 --> 06:32.524
A problem talking to a girl?

06:32.526 --> 06:33.525
Like, if i was a girl

06:33.527 --> 06:34.192
In the club

06:34.194 --> 06:35.293
And you just thought, you know,

06:35.295 --> 06:36.361
Like i was good-looking

06:36.363 --> 06:37.062
Or something, would you

06:37.064 --> 06:38.563
Walk up to me and say something,

06:38.565 --> 06:39.231
Or would you stand

06:39.233 --> 06:40.265
On the other side and say, "man,

06:40.267 --> 06:41.366
I wish i could go talk to her,

06:41.368 --> 06:42.067
But there's just--"

06:42.069 --> 06:43.101
>> i would be that guy.

06:43.103 --> 06:43.869
>> the second one?

06:43.871 --> 06:44.536
>> yeah.

06:44.538 --> 06:46.338
The internet made it easier,

06:46.340 --> 06:47.172
I guess you could say.

06:47.174 --> 06:47.906
Breaking the ice

06:47.908 --> 06:48.573
And stuff like that.

06:48.575 --> 06:49.307
>> yeah.

06:49.309 --> 06:50.575
So rylan gave you the chance

06:50.577 --> 06:51.843
To be brave and go up

06:51.845 --> 06:52.878
And talk to her and, like,

06:52.880 --> 06:54.246
Be yourself, what you would

06:54.248 --> 06:55.147
Be afraid to do in person?

06:55.149 --> 06:55.847
>> uh-huh.

06:55.849 --> 06:57.549
And she's okay with that.

06:57.551 --> 06:58.517
>> can you show us

06:58.519 --> 06:59.451
Some pictures of her, please?

06:59.453 --> 07:00.118
So that we can--

07:00.120 --> 07:01.086
>> i'm so excited to see this.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.654
>> yeah, i'm really curious.

07:02.656 --> 07:03.889
Okay.

07:03.891 --> 07:04.556
Cute.

07:04.558 --> 07:05.323
>> oh, she's beautiful.

07:05.325 --> 07:07.726
>> very cute, little nose ring.

07:07.728 --> 07:08.460
Oh, yeah.

07:08.462 --> 07:09.995
Those look like regular-person

07:09.997 --> 07:11.363
Photos, which is good.

07:11.365 --> 07:12.364
When you look at those pictures,

07:12.366 --> 07:13.498
What do you feel?

07:13.500 --> 07:14.399
>> i feel like i love her.

07:14.401 --> 07:16.034
You know, she doesn't have

07:16.036 --> 07:17.135
The greatest home life.

07:17.137 --> 07:18.603
Her parents are divorced and she

07:18.605 --> 07:19.971
Doesn't have a good relationship

07:19.973 --> 07:21.573
With her dad and stepdad.

07:21.575 --> 07:23.775

07:23.777 --> 07:26.912

07:26.914 --> 07:28.947
>> her mom would kind of,

07:28.949 --> 07:30.081
You know, belittle her

07:30.083 --> 07:30.816
And i would, you know,

07:30.818 --> 07:31.483
Help her through it

07:31.485 --> 07:32.551
And talk to her all the time.

07:32.553 --> 07:33.285
>> but she was--she would

Call you upset?

07:34.988 --> 07:35.787

07:35.789 --> 07:36.455

07:36.457 --> 07:38.089
I feel like i could give her,

07:38.091 --> 07:39.191
You know, like, a safe haven,

07:39.193 --> 07:41.059
You know, give her a place to,

07:41.061 --> 07:43.061
You know, be happy for once.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.129
>> walk us through

07:44.131 --> 07:45.464
All the key moments

07:45.466 --> 07:46.164
In the relationship

07:46.166 --> 07:47.065
From the beginning.

07:47.067 --> 07:47.966
>> well, i sent her

07:47.968 --> 07:48.800
The first message.

07:48.802 --> 07:49.935
I said something sweet,

07:49.937 --> 07:51.136
You know, and we exchanged

07:51.138 --> 07:52.204
Numbers and started

07:52.206 --> 07:53.805
To talk and, you know,

07:53.807 --> 07:55.073
Get interested in each other.

07:55.075 --> 07:57.476
I actually went to go,

07:57.478 --> 07:59.044
You know, meet her once

07:59.046 --> 07:59.945
When she lived close

07:59.947 --> 08:00.979
And i went to her aunt

08:00.981 --> 08:02.214
And uncle's house.

08:02.216 --> 08:04.015
I knocked on the door

08:04.017 --> 08:05.016
And her uncle answered

08:05.018 --> 08:07.986
And i asked if rylan was here,

08:07.988 --> 08:09.955
And he told me that no one

08:09.957 --> 08:11.256
By that name lived there.

08:11.258 --> 08:12.257
>> whoa.

08:12.259 --> 08:14.025
That's, like, a major red flag.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.126
>> yeah, we've talked about that

08:15.128 --> 08:17.095
And she said that it was

08:17.097 --> 08:18.630
Her uncle, you know, just--

08:18.632 --> 08:20.131
He didn't know who i was,

08:20.133 --> 08:21.266
Which was kind of depressing.

08:21.268 --> 08:22.200
>> and then she said,

08:22.202 --> 08:23.134
"i need a little help

08:23.136 --> 08:23.969
With gas money?"

08:23.971 --> 08:24.936
>> mm-hmm.

08:24.938 --> 08:25.704
>> and so she said, "can you

08:25.706 --> 08:26.738
Send me 100 bucks?"

08:26.740 --> 08:27.939
>> well, i--she didn't ask

08:27.941 --> 08:29.040
For a specific number.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.008
I just sent her

08:30.010 --> 08:31.209
Whatever i thought would help.

08:31.211 --> 08:32.043
>> and if you just said,

08:32.044 --> 08:33.712
"hey, can we facetime today,"

08:33.714 --> 08:35.212
What would her response be?

08:35.215 --> 08:36.982
>> probably that she couldn't.

08:36.984 --> 08:38.015
She doesn't have the data

08:38.018 --> 08:39.551
Or something like that to do it.

08:39.553 --> 08:40.952
>> i'm sure she has places

08:40.953 --> 08:42.520
She can go, like a starbucks,

08:42.523 --> 08:44.054
To get on free wi-fi, so, like,

08:44.057 --> 08:45.290
You understand that

08:45.292 --> 08:46.791
There's a lot of things that

08:46.793 --> 08:48.927
Add up to her maybe not being?

08:48.929 --> 08:50.328
>> yeah, i do understand that,

08:50.330 --> 08:51.663
But i'm very hopeful

08:51.665 --> 08:53.398
That she is the girl

08:53.400 --> 08:55.166
In the pictures, you know?

08:55.168 --> 08:56.434
We have built up

08:56.436 --> 08:58.470
A good relationship throughout,

08:58.472 --> 08:59.471
You know, a year and a half,

08:59.473 --> 09:01.039
Ups and downs and everything.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.574
I just try to remain hopeful

09:02.576 --> 09:03.508
And, you know, believe

09:03.510 --> 09:04.976
That she is who she says she is.

09:15.255 --> 09:16.354
All of this out.

09:16.356 --> 09:18.189

09:18.191 --> 09:19.491

09:39.246 --> 09:40.245
It's just, like,

>> have you been cranky yet?

10:54.921 --> 10:55.587
>> no.

10:55.589 --> 10:56.254
>> okay.

10:56.256 --> 10:57.088
>> all right, well, we got

10:57.090 --> 10:58.023
Work to do, max.

10:58.025 --> 10:58.757
>> all right.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.191
Good luck, guys.

11:00.193 --> 11:01.459
>> bye.

11:01.461 --> 11:02.527
All right, so,

11:02.529 --> 11:04.429
Let's just start with a little

11:04.431 --> 11:06.431
Searching for rylan collins.

11:06.433 --> 11:07.666
Facebook search.

11:07.668 --> 11:10.502
Let's see.

11:10.504 --> 11:11.469
Okay.

11:11.471 --> 11:13.138
Not a single female rylan

11:13.140 --> 11:13.838
Shows up.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.073
"rylan" seems to be

11:15.075 --> 11:17.375
Pretty exclusively a guy's name.

11:17.377 --> 11:20.478
Let's do a phone number search.

11:20.480 --> 11:21.146
>> my god, this is

11:21.148 --> 11:21.813
So interesting.

11:21.815 --> 11:22.614
>> okay, let's copy-paste

11:22.616 --> 11:24.649
And let's see what we get.

11:24.651 --> 11:27.285
>> ahh, i'm so excited!

11:27.287 --> 11:27.952
Ooh.

11:27.954 --> 11:29.120
>> ooh.

11:29.122 --> 11:31.122
>> cassie [bleep].

11:31.124 --> 11:32.123
>> in georgetown.

11:32.125 --> 11:33.391
That's near austin area.

11:33.393 --> 11:35.260
I'm so cracked right now.

11:35.262 --> 11:36.528
>> let's just do a search for

11:36.530 --> 11:38.296
Cassandra [bleep], georgetown,

11:38.298 --> 11:41.499
If anything shows up.

11:41.501 --> 11:42.667
Indictments.

11:42.669 --> 11:44.736
Does that look--a mugshot?

11:44.738 --> 11:45.570
Oh, boy.

11:45.572 --> 11:46.938
"18-year-old takes police

11:46.940 --> 11:49.374
On stolen vehicle chase."

11:49.376 --> 11:50.041
So she could have

11:50.043 --> 11:50.775
A little bit of a record.

11:50.777 --> 11:51.776
>> i don't know, but i would not

11:51.778 --> 11:52.444
Want to mess with her.

11:52.446 --> 11:53.111
>> what is this?

11:53.113 --> 11:54.779
"credit or debit card abuse."

11:54.781 --> 11:55.914
>> nev!

11:55.916 --> 11:56.715
What's happening?

11:56.717 --> 11:58.349
>> well, she's a criminal.

11:58.351 --> 12:00.151
Maybe she scams people.

12:00.153 --> 12:00.919
>> maybe she asks people

12:00.921 --> 12:01.753
For money to drive to see them.

12:01.755 --> 12:02.954
>> and that--and this could just

12:02.956 --> 12:05.657
Be one of her, like, scams.

12:05.659 --> 12:06.991
>> i've seen on the show before

12:06.993 --> 12:08.460
That you take peoples' pictures

12:08.462 --> 12:09.761
And search their pictures.

12:09.763 --> 12:10.628
>> so look, it's really easy.

12:10.630 --> 12:11.529
Just go to images

12:11.531 --> 12:13.431
And you just click and drag

12:13.433 --> 12:15.200
Into the search window,

12:15.202 --> 12:16.668
And you let go and it searches.

12:16.670 --> 12:18.069
Let's see.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.137
Okay, no.

12:19.139 --> 12:20.538
No direct hit on that one.

12:20.540 --> 12:23.975
Let's try the second one.

12:23.977 --> 12:25.143
Whoa, what is this?

12:25.145 --> 12:26.911
This picture came back

12:26.913 --> 12:28.313
With a result

12:28.315 --> 12:30.782
For savanah [bleep]?

12:30.784 --> 12:32.684
A facebook page.

12:32.686 --> 12:33.451
Yes. Yes!

12:33.453 --> 12:34.119
>> oh, my gosh.

12:34.121 --> 12:35.086
>> oh, my god, look,

12:35.088 --> 12:36.454
There's that picture.

12:36.456 --> 12:37.756
Oh, boy.

12:37.758 --> 12:38.523
Here's another picture.

12:38.525 --> 12:39.691
>> shut up.

12:39.693 --> 12:40.792
>> that's another one.

12:40.794 --> 12:41.459
And as a--

12:41.461 --> 12:42.460
>> she has a ring on her finger.

12:42.462 --> 12:43.728
>> she has a ring on her finger

12:43.730 --> 12:45.163
And this was from january.

12:45.165 --> 12:45.964
>> this is crazy.

12:45.966 --> 12:46.998
>> oh, boy.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.266
Wow.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.168
So there she is with this guy

12:50.170 --> 12:52.137
Over the last, like, year.

12:52.139 --> 12:53.037
They're definitely together...

12:53.039 --> 12:54.005
>> wow.

12:54.007 --> 12:55.473
>> for a while now.

12:55.475 --> 12:56.174
>> and we don't know

12:56.176 --> 12:57.308
Where she lives,

12:57.310 --> 12:59.077
But if we go to her friends

12:59.079 --> 12:59.911
And we look through

12:59.913 --> 13:01.146
Where they mostly live.

13:01.148 --> 13:02.413
Marble falls.

13:02.415 --> 13:03.448
Texas connection.

13:03.450 --> 13:04.949
San an--okay, so this girl

13:04.951 --> 13:06.050
Lives in texas.

13:06.052 --> 13:06.985
So what's the connection

13:06.987 --> 13:09.487
Between savanah and rylan?

13:09.489 --> 13:10.855
Is there a connection?

13:10.857 --> 13:12.290
We need to message savanah.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.992
There's a chance she might know

13:13.994 --> 13:16.594
Who's behind this fake profile.

13:16.596 --> 13:17.629
>> "please text/call me

13:17.631 --> 13:18.930
At this number. Thanks."

13:18.932 --> 13:20.098
>> great.

13:20.100 --> 13:20.899
Right now, there's, like,

13:20.901 --> 13:21.599
Two scenarios.

13:21.601 --> 13:22.967
Either he's talking to this girl

13:22.969 --> 13:25.436
Who is potentially a con artist

13:25.438 --> 13:27.105
Of some kind, or he's actually

13:27.107 --> 13:28.406
Talking to this girl savanah.

13:28.408 --> 13:30.041
Looks like she's engaged,

13:30.043 --> 13:30.975
In which case--

13:30.977 --> 13:31.643
>> we have a whole

13:31.645 --> 13:32.343
Different scenario.

13:32.345 --> 13:34.012
>> maybe savanah

13:34.014 --> 13:35.113
Was a little unhappy

13:35.115 --> 13:36.414
And she could have been

13:36.416 --> 13:39.050
Using this fake name as a mask

13:39.052 --> 13:40.151
Because she wanted to have

13:40.153 --> 13:42.053
A relationship with someone and

13:42.055 --> 13:43.421
Not have them know who she was.

13:43.423 --> 13:44.088
>> yeah.

13:44.090 --> 13:45.089
I mean, cassandra, if she's

13:45.091 --> 13:46.057
Really that much of a criminal

13:46.059 --> 13:47.091
And if she only was using

13:47.093 --> 13:48.026
This girl for pictures,

13:48.028 --> 13:49.194
She could've found pictures from

13:49.196 --> 13:50.461
Somebody who lives in any state.

13:50.463 --> 13:51.129
Why texas?

13:51.131 --> 13:51.796
>> right.

13:51.798 --> 13:53.565
>> this could be a possibility

13:53.567 --> 13:55.133
That it is her.

13:55.135 --> 13:55.834
>> we wait to hear back

13:55.836 --> 13:57.368
From savanah, and then

13:57.370 --> 13:58.970
We take all this to devan

13:58.972 --> 14:00.305
Tomorrow and, you know,

14:00.307 --> 14:02.106
We figure out what to do next.

14:02.108 --> 14:03.141
>> my heart is, like,

14:03.143 --> 14:06.211
Fluttering right now.

14:08.447 --> 14:12.016
>> when we arrived here
in amarillo, todrick and i
went to waffle house.

14:12.018 --> 14:12.934
Went to waffle house.

14:12.935 --> 14:13.851
It's front page news.

14:13.854 --> 14:15.353
There i am, top story.

14:15.355 --> 14:16.354
Todrick's mentioned too.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.021
[knocking at the door]

14:17.023 --> 14:17.822
>> hello.

14:17.824 --> 14:18.489
How are you?

14:18.491 --> 14:19.157
>> hey, man.

14:19.159 --> 14:20.658
"amarillo times," front page.

14:20.660 --> 14:21.659
>> shut up!

14:21.661 --> 14:22.360
I was like, "why are you

14:22.362 --> 14:23.294
Bringing me the paper?"

14:23.296 --> 14:23.962
>> look at that.

14:23.964 --> 14:24.629
>> "schulman invited

14:24.631 --> 14:25.296
Todrick hall."

14:25.298 --> 14:25.964
>> hey.

14:25.966 --> 14:26.631
>> yeah!

14:26.633 --> 14:27.298
>> crazy.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.333
I've never been involved

14:28.335 --> 14:29.767
In a waffle house story before.

14:29.769 --> 14:30.602
>> i know, right?

14:30.604 --> 14:31.769
>> have we gotten any news?

14:31.771 --> 14:33.338
>> maybe she got back to me

14:33.340 --> 14:34.973
On the facebook.

14:34.975 --> 14:35.773
Ugh, no.

14:35.775 --> 14:36.608
>> she didn't write us back?

14:36.610 --> 14:37.675
>> nothing? Really?

14:37.677 --> 14:38.843
>> so in this situation,

14:38.845 --> 14:39.510
What do we do?

14:39.512 --> 14:40.245
>> the other thing we can

14:40.247 --> 14:40.845
Check--

14:40.847 --> 14:41.512
>> is instagram?

14:41.514 --> 14:42.313
>> yeah, is instagram.

14:42.315 --> 14:43.147
>> i was gonna say that

14:43.149 --> 14:43.948
Last night, i was like,

14:43.950 --> 14:44.649
"why didn't we check

14:44.651 --> 14:45.350
Her instagram?"

14:45.352 --> 14:46.017
>> all right, hold on,

14:46.019 --> 14:46.918
Let's do a search for "savanah."

14:46.920 --> 14:47.585
>> okay, so--

14:47.587 --> 14:48.987
>> here we go.

14:48.989 --> 14:49.721
Oh, yeah, that's her.

14:49.723 --> 14:50.421
>> that's her.

14:50.423 --> 14:51.556
>> wow, savanah.

14:51.558 --> 14:52.257
There's actually

14:52.259 --> 14:53.491
A lot more photos here.

14:53.493 --> 14:54.926
So the girl in the pictures

14:54.928 --> 14:56.327
Is definitely savanah

14:56.329 --> 14:57.428
It would appear.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.264
So let's send her a message.

14:59.266 --> 14:59.998
>> okay.

15:00.000 --> 15:00.832
>> "hey."

15:00.834 --> 15:01.499
>> "girl."

15:01.501 --> 15:02.433
>> "i'm with @toddyrockstar

15:02.435 --> 15:03.468
Filming an episode of "catfish"

15:03.470 --> 15:04.335
And you are involved.

15:04.337 --> 15:05.003
Please call me."

15:05.005 --> 15:05.904
I'm sending this message to her.

15:05.906 --> 15:06.938
>> wait, you need an emoji

15:06.940 --> 15:07.639
For sure.

15:07.641 --> 15:08.373
>> okay.

15:08.375 --> 15:09.874
Sending.

15:09.876 --> 15:10.541
>> both: Okay.

15:10.543 --> 15:11.976
>> now, i want to see if any

15:11.978 --> 15:14.379
Of her pictures are geotagged.

15:14.381 --> 15:15.747
Selfie thursday.

15:15.749 --> 15:17.448
Oh, she just posted this.

15:17.450 --> 15:18.483
"at <i> mi casa."</i>

15:18.485 --> 15:19.684
See that?

15:19.686 --> 15:20.551
>> yeah.

15:20.553 --> 15:21.819
>> and that's geotagged.

15:21.821 --> 15:23.087
Marble falls.

15:23.089 --> 15:25.089
So savanah lives

15:25.091 --> 15:26.591
In marble falls.

15:26.593 --> 15:27.258
>> okay.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.393
>> is that where rylan

15:28.395 --> 15:29.227
Said she lived?

15:29.229 --> 15:30.128
>> i don't remember what city.

15:30.130 --> 15:30.728
I thought she said

15:30.730 --> 15:31.462
That she just lived near--

15:31.464 --> 15:32.196
>> hold on, let's look

15:32.198 --> 15:32.730
At the email.

15:32.732 --> 15:34.699
[bleep] drive, marble falls.

15:34.701 --> 15:35.633
Okay, hold on.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.435
Let's plug in the address

15:37.437 --> 15:39.003
That devan sent her

15:39.005 --> 15:40.738
Birthday card in marble falls.

15:40.740 --> 15:41.439
Oh, man, yeah.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.741
So marble falls is a small town.

15:43.743 --> 15:45.910
Look, [bleep] drive.

15:45.912 --> 15:46.678
[bleep] drive and ocotilla.

15:46.680 --> 15:47.679
>> shut up.

15:47.681 --> 15:48.980
>> and look, [bleep] drive,

15:48.982 --> 15:49.681
Ocotilla.

15:49.683 --> 15:51.282
Oh, man.

15:51.284 --> 15:54.385
They're in the exact same spot.

15:54.387 --> 15:55.520
Okay, this is weird now.

15:55.522 --> 15:56.387
Okay, so wait a second.

15:56.389 --> 15:57.121
>> [laughs]

15:57.123 --> 15:58.389
>> so that means that

15:58.391 --> 15:59.824
If savanah is real,

15:59.826 --> 16:01.793
He's either talking to her

16:01.795 --> 16:03.361
And the boyfriend she was, like,

16:03.363 --> 16:04.195
Kind of seeing him on the side.

16:04.197 --> 16:05.063
>> that's her real instagram.

16:05.065 --> 16:05.630
That has to be

16:05.632 --> 16:06.297
Her real instagram.

16:06.299 --> 16:07.165
>> i think it is.

16:07.167 --> 16:08.900
Or rylan who's been pretending

16:08.902 --> 16:10.902
To be her with a different name,

16:10.904 --> 16:12.203
Really sort of, like,

16:12.205 --> 16:13.871
Knows savanah in real life

16:13.873 --> 16:15.273
And got her actual address

16:15.275 --> 16:17.542
And gave it to devan.

16:17.544 --> 16:18.943
>> this is so crazy.

16:18.945 --> 16:19.644
We need to just check in

16:19.646 --> 16:20.278
With devan.

16:20.280 --> 16:20.945
>> we need to check in

16:20.947 --> 16:21.612
With devan, although

16:21.614 --> 16:22.347
I think he's gonna be

Squint your eyes a little bit.

16:28.188 --> 16:29.687
Tilt you head down.

16:29.689 --> 16:30.855
That's the money shot.

>> [laughs]

17:00.420 --> 17:01.452

Kind of weird.

>> okay.

17:08.862 --> 17:09.761
>> because the thing that

17:09.762 --> 17:11.462

17:34.220 --> 17:35.987
Arrested not too long ago,

17:35.989 --> 17:37.822
But she said that

17:37.824 --> 17:39.323
They got it all taken care of.

17:46.366 --> 17:47.799
The pictures that you sent us

17:47.801 --> 17:48.566
And we ran them through

17:48.568 --> 17:49.667
A google image search,

17:49.669 --> 17:50.735
And the last picture--

17:50.737 --> 17:52.003
Which was this one--

17:52.005 --> 17:54.005
Actually got a hit

>> yeah.

18:06.686 --> 18:08.352
>> there is a ring.

18:08.354 --> 18:10.288
It kind of looks like she

18:10.290 --> 18:13.858
Might be married to this guy...

18:13.860 --> 18:16.561
In which case, maybe savanah

18:16.563 --> 18:18.062
Was a little unhappy during

18:18.064 --> 18:19.263
The course of her relationship

18:19.265 --> 18:20.565
And she could have been

18:20.567 --> 18:23.334
Using this fake name as a mask

18:23.336 --> 18:24.235
Because she wanted to have

18:24.237 --> 18:25.736
A relationship with someone

18:25.738 --> 18:26.771
And not have them know

18:37.016 --> 18:43.221
I'm really dumbfounded.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.490
I mean, it's not fun

18:45.492 --> 18:51.562
When you're lied to, ever, so.

18:54.500 --> 18:55.466

18:55.468 --> 18:56.400
The girl in the picture is

Someone named savanah.

18:57.403 --> 18:58.436

19:01.975 --> 19:05.510

19:15.522 --> 19:17.355

They're literally

19:19.125 --> 19:22.160

As the address

19:23.496 --> 19:25.630
You sent that birthday card to,

19:25.632 --> 19:27.465
So that means that if savanah

19:27.467 --> 19:29.300

19:29.302 --> 19:30.434
Married to this guy.

Was a profile

24:54.494 --> 24:55.593
With pictures of you?

24:55.595 --> 24:56.894
>> actually, my neighbor

24:56.896 --> 24:57.962
Knocked on my door

24:57.964 --> 24:59.897
And told me that

24:59.899 --> 25:01.732
Her roommate or friend

25:01.734 --> 25:02.967

25:11.644 --> 25:12.276
Get this straight.

[laughs]

25:18.251 --> 25:19.083
And i know the girl

25:19.085 --> 25:20.317

She added me a couple years ago.

25:27.760 --> 25:28.592

25:28.594 --> 25:30.528
She said her friend michelle

>> yes.

25:32.965 --> 25:33.697

>> yes.

25:35.801 --> 25:37.801
I have never met her in person.

25:37.803 --> 25:39.203
She just messaged me on facebook

25:39.205 --> 25:40.170
A couple times.

25:40.172 --> 25:41.171
She sent me one

25:41.173 --> 25:42.606
A couple years ago saying

25:42.608 --> 25:44.174
How she didn't know how we

25:44.176 --> 25:46.377
Became friends on facebook,

25:46.379 --> 25:47.711
But she wanted to let me know

25:47.713 --> 25:48.879
I was super-gorgeous

25:48.881 --> 25:50.981
And then she invited me to go

25:50.983 --> 25:52.149
To, like, some "get-togethers"

25:52.151 --> 25:53.717
That they had down the street,

25:53.719 --> 25:54.718
And i was just like,

25:54.720 --> 25:56.220
"i don't really know you,"

25:56.222 --> 25:57.821
But i never went.

25:57.823 --> 25:58.722
>> that's pretty weird.

25:58.724 --> 25:59.957
Where does michelle live?

25:59.959 --> 26:01.292
>> she did live with my neighbor

26:01.294 --> 26:02.626
A little bit, but i think

26:02.628 --> 26:03.894
She moved or something,

26:03.896 --> 26:04.828
Or they got in a fight

26:04.830 --> 26:05.563
Or something.

26:05.565 --> 26:06.664
>> sounds sort of like rylan.

30:54.153 --> 30:54.885
>> and he covered for you

30:54.887 --> 30:55.485
And just said,

30:55.487 --> 30:56.320
"i don't know who that is?"

30:56.322 --> 30:57.154
>> no, he didn't know

30:57.156 --> 30:57.955
Anything about it.

30:57.957 --> 30:59.122
>> oh, so he genuinely didn't

30:59.124 --> 30:59.857
Know who you were because

30:59.859 --> 31:01.024
You were asking for...

31:01.026 --> 31:01.692
>> rylan.

31:01.694 --> 31:03.894
>> rylan.

31:03.896 --> 31:05.596
What was it about devan

31:05.598 --> 31:06.496
That you liked?

31:06.498 --> 31:07.865
>> how i could tell him anything

31:07.867 --> 31:10.100
And he never judged me.

31:10.102 --> 31:11.735
Things i can't tell anybody.

31:11.737 --> 31:13.604
>> you know, i-i really am

31:13.606 --> 31:14.872
Upset.

31:14.874 --> 31:15.839
For over a year and a half,

31:15.841 --> 31:16.940
I really wanted to finally

31:16.942 --> 31:17.841
Meet, you know,

31:17.843 --> 31:19.409
The person i was talking to

31:19.411 --> 31:20.978
And it was just a long road

31:20.980 --> 31:22.045
Where we tried to meet

31:22.047 --> 31:23.513
And it never happened

31:23.515 --> 31:25.883
And it really sucked.

31:25.885 --> 31:26.917
>> it kind of just--

31:26.919 --> 31:28.585
It just happened.

31:28.587 --> 31:30.254
I don't have anybody to talk to

31:30.256 --> 31:31.121
And you were there.

31:31.123 --> 31:32.856
You helped me through so much.

31:32.858 --> 31:33.824
>> i thought i was talking

31:33.826 --> 31:35.826
To someone different.

31:35.828 --> 31:36.827
>> i feel like devan would have

31:36.829 --> 31:38.061
Been there for you anyway,

31:38.063 --> 31:38.729
Just as a friend

31:38.731 --> 31:40.230
If that's what you truly needed.

31:40.232 --> 31:41.164
It's really not fair

31:41.166 --> 31:42.666
For you to have wasted his time

31:42.668 --> 31:43.567
And you just kind of

31:43.569 --> 31:44.635
Are making all these excuses

31:44.637 --> 31:45.769
And saying everything was real

31:45.771 --> 31:47.271
But everything wasn't real.

31:47.273 --> 31:48.805
It's not just that the picture

31:48.807 --> 31:50.807
That you sent was not right.

31:50.809 --> 31:53.210
A lot of it was fabricated.

31:53.212 --> 31:57.814
>> [sniffs]

31:57.816 --> 31:59.783
I've got a lot of problems

31:59.785 --> 32:05.155
And he was always there.

32:05.157 --> 32:12.029
[sniffs]

32:12.031 --> 32:12.963
>> well, look.

32:12.965 --> 32:15.232
I know this wasn't easy for you,

32:15.234 --> 32:16.433
Talking or identifying

32:16.435 --> 32:18.035
Exactly how he feels, to be

32:18.037 --> 32:20.938
Fair, is not his strong suit.

32:20.940 --> 32:22.239
So i think for devan's sake,

32:22.241 --> 32:23.040
He needs a little bit of time

32:23.042 --> 32:24.708
To sort of understand

32:24.710 --> 32:25.876
What he's feeling and then

32:25.878 --> 32:27.878
Maybe more accurately

32:27.880 --> 32:29.046
Express that.

32:29.048 --> 32:30.647
Maybe tomorrow

32:30.649 --> 32:32.549
Would be better for that?

32:32.551 --> 32:34.051
>> i'm okay with that.

32:34.053 --> 32:35.085
>> so we can meet back up

32:35.087 --> 32:35.819
With you?

32:35.821 --> 32:36.987
>> mm-hmm.

32:36.989 --> 32:37.788
>> well, it was nice to meet

32:37.790 --> 32:38.455
You.

32:38.457 --> 32:39.122
>> nice to meet you.

32:39.124 --> 32:40.657
>> thanks for coming out.

32:40.659 --> 32:46.730
>> thank you.

32:55.807 --> 32:56.740
>> i don't think it's okay.

32:56.742 --> 32:58.942
I mean, you should be truthful

32:58.944 --> 32:59.676
With people

32:59.678 --> 33:00.644
You're trying to meet and talk

33:00.646 --> 33:04.047
To or i wouldn't do it at all.

33:04.049 --> 33:05.382
<i>>> ♪ i'm feeling things ♪</i>

33:05.384 --> 33:10.587
<i>♪ i never wanted to ♪</i>

33:10.589 --> 33:11.588

33:12.891 --> 33:15.559
<i>♪ ooh, ooh, ooh ♪</i>

33:15.561 --> 33:17.027
>> probably not.

33:17.029 --> 33:18.028
I'm really upset.

33:18.030 --> 33:18.962
I don't feel the same way

33:18.964 --> 33:22.032
Anymore.

33:27.171 --> 33:28.238

33:28.240 --> 33:33.143
The tv show" continues now.

A couple of things

That i want to ask.

33:46.859 --> 33:48.692
I want to know how long was it

Gonna take for her to tell me.

33:50.262 --> 33:51.028

33:58.337 --> 33:59.569
>> hi, it's nev.

34:03.374 --> 34:04.374
>> how do you feel about

34:04.376 --> 34:05.275
Meeting up with us

34:05.277 --> 34:08.344
And talking some more?

34:09.414 --> 34:10.347
>> listen, if you leave

34:10.349 --> 34:11.313
My black ass outside

34:11.315 --> 34:12.049
In the heat again

34:12.051 --> 34:12.916
Like you did yesterday...

34:12.918 --> 34:13.583
[laughter]

34:13.585 --> 34:14.451
Things are not gonna

34:14.453 --> 34:15.585
Be cute at all.

34:15.587 --> 34:16.253
Don't be peaking

34:16.255 --> 34:16.953
Through the peephole.

34:16.955 --> 34:18.221
Get your ass downstairs

34:18.223 --> 34:19.022
And be ready to come out

34:19.024 --> 34:19.956
When we knock on that door,

34:19.958 --> 34:21.925
You understand me, miss thing?

34:23.728 --> 34:25.594
>> okay.

34:25.597 --> 34:26.929
>> so we will head over there

34:55.761 --> 34:57.327
Come on in, everybody.

34:57.329 --> 34:59.196
Okay, here we are.

34:59.198 --> 35:00.363
You want to try and start us up

35:00.365 --> 35:02.365
A little bit?

35:02.367 --> 35:03.667
>> so if the show didn't

35:03.669 --> 35:04.734
Happen, would you have ever

35:04.736 --> 35:06.269
Told me?

35:06.271 --> 35:07.237
>> maybe not.

35:07.239 --> 35:08.505
I don't think so.

35:08.507 --> 35:09.473
I wouldn't have the balls

35:09.475 --> 35:11.641
To do it.

35:11.643 --> 35:12.843
I made a meetme

35:12.845 --> 35:14.311
With my actually pictures,

35:14.313 --> 35:15.712
But literally nobody

35:15.714 --> 35:16.413
Was talking to me.

35:16.415 --> 35:17.080
>> no one?

35:17.082 --> 35:18.281
>> nobody would talk to me.

35:18.283 --> 35:19.382
It made me feel awful.

35:19.384 --> 35:20.117
>> i'm really curious

35:20.119 --> 35:21.251
To know about your family

35:21.253 --> 35:22.752
And what your family is like.

35:22.754 --> 35:24.121
>> my father was never

35:24.123 --> 35:26.690
There at all,

35:26.692 --> 35:28.959
And my mom--

35:28.961 --> 35:30.093
We're so much alike that we

35:30.095 --> 35:32.095
Can't get along for anything,

35:32.097 --> 35:33.697
And i'm the only mixed one

35:33.699 --> 35:34.531
In my family.

35:34.533 --> 35:35.232
>> so, you have brothers

35:35.234 --> 35:35.866
And sisters?

35:35.868 --> 35:37.100
>> i have a half-sister.

35:37.102 --> 35:38.735
I don't have any full siblings.

35:38.737 --> 35:40.003
>> you have a half-sister and--

35:40.005 --> 35:41.805
>> on my dad's side, i have 30.

35:41.807 --> 35:42.506
>> 30?

35:42.508 --> 35:43.907
>> well, 30-something.

35:43.909 --> 35:44.741
I don't even think

35:44.743 --> 35:45.909
He really knows how many.

35:45.911 --> 35:47.077
>> wow.

35:47.079 --> 35:48.845
>> that must be so strange

35:48.847 --> 35:49.779
For you, but--

35:49.781 --> 35:50.914
>> it was really strange.

35:53.251 --> 35:54.618
That's when he came up and,

35:54.620 --> 35:56.720
Like, "i've got 30-some kids

35:56.722 --> 35:58.421
I haven't done nothing for,

35:58.423 --> 35:59.389
And i'm gonna be there

35:59.391 --> 36:00.390
For them now."

36:00.392 --> 36:01.925
And obviously, two years later,

36:01.927 --> 36:04.694
I haven't talked to him, so.

36:04.696 --> 36:05.428
>> my dad was never there

36:05.430 --> 36:06.763
For me either, and we think

36:06.765 --> 36:07.731
It's normal, but it's not

36:07.733 --> 36:08.565
Normal, and when people

36:08.567 --> 36:09.833
Aren't there for you,

36:09.835 --> 36:11.234
Situations like this happen

36:11.236 --> 36:12.202
Because you're out there

36:12.204 --> 36:13.170
Searching for love

36:13.172 --> 36:13.970
In all these places

36:13.972 --> 36:15.472
That you should've gotten

36:15.474 --> 36:16.973
From inside your own home.

36:16.975 --> 36:18.642
>> mm-hmm.

36:18.644 --> 36:21.011
>> well, when--when we first

36:21.013 --> 36:23.113
Started talking, why?

36:23.115 --> 36:25.182
Why didn't you tell me then?

36:25.184 --> 36:26.049
>> you're the person i could

36:26.051 --> 36:27.350
Talk to about anything,

36:27.352 --> 36:29.920
And i felt if i went out there

36:29.922 --> 36:31.454
And told you the truth then,

36:31.456 --> 36:33.557
Then i wouldn't have anybody.

36:33.559 --> 36:34.558
But i guess it goes back

36:34.560 --> 36:36.393
To how i'm mixed and

36:36.395 --> 36:37.894
I've never liked how i look

36:37.896 --> 36:39.196
Because i've always wanted

36:39.198 --> 36:40.931
To be just straight white.

36:40.933 --> 36:42.799
>> there's a whole huge world

36:42.801 --> 36:43.633
Outside of this,

36:43.635 --> 36:45.068
Like, small area in texas

36:45.070 --> 36:46.803
Of people who literally

36:46.805 --> 36:48.271
Are like, "i love me

36:48.273 --> 36:52.075
A tall, caramel, curly-haired,

36:52.077 --> 36:53.777
Like, girl with a gap

36:53.779 --> 36:54.578
In her front teeth."

36:54.580 --> 36:55.579
It's like the--

36:55.581 --> 36:56.680
You shouldn't cover it up.

36:56.682 --> 36:57.414
You should just be like,

36:57.416 --> 36:58.548
"yes, this is my gap.

36:58.550 --> 37:00.350
This is what i'm working with,"

37:00.352 --> 37:01.551
And just realize that

37:01.553 --> 37:02.953
There are people out there

37:02.955 --> 37:03.720
And those are the people

37:03.722 --> 37:05.088
That you need to find.

37:05.090 --> 37:05.855
The question is,

37:05.857 --> 37:06.590
What are you gonna do

37:06.592 --> 37:08.858
When you do find that person?

37:08.860 --> 37:10.093
I see you have

37:10.095 --> 37:11.194
A little letter with you.

37:11.196 --> 37:12.929
What is that?

37:12.931 --> 37:15.232
>> oh, i wrote him a letter.

37:15.234 --> 37:16.066
>> really?

37:16.068 --> 37:17.834
>> mm-hmm.

37:17.836 --> 37:18.969
It's to let him know

37:18.971 --> 37:19.936
How i feel, like,

37:19.938 --> 37:21.204
If i couldn't tell him then

37:21.206 --> 37:22.205
I could just write it all down

37:22.207 --> 37:23.340
And tell him that way.

37:23.342 --> 37:24.241
>> is this something we

37:24.243 --> 37:25.242
Should all be in the room for?

37:25.244 --> 37:27.877
>> oh, yeah.

37:27.879 --> 37:29.045
"the thing is, you make me

37:29.047 --> 37:29.846
Happy, you know

37:29.848 --> 37:30.880
Exactly what to say

37:30.882 --> 37:32.816
At exactly the right times.

37:32.818 --> 37:34.117
You don't judge me.

37:34.119 --> 37:35.318
I felt safe with you

37:35.320 --> 37:36.386
When we talked.

37:36.388 --> 37:37.220
I loved how you knew

37:37.222 --> 37:39.222
Exactly how i was feeling,

37:39.224 --> 37:40.924
How you always knew what to say

37:40.926 --> 37:43.026
So i don't feel a certain way.

37:43.028 --> 37:44.594
I love your smile and the way

37:44.596 --> 37:46.663
You laugh at my stupid jokes,

37:46.665 --> 37:47.797
But honestly, i loved

37:47.799 --> 37:49.899
How caring and loving you are.

37:49.901 --> 37:51.167
I'll always love you.

37:51.169 --> 37:52.035
You're my best friend
