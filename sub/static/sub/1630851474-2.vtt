04:07.335 --> 04:09.070

I...
I think it's highly unlikely

09:00.562 --> 09:03.431
that they're capable
of raising a child,

09:03.431 --> 09:06.768
but, well, neither were you,
and you had three.

09:08.102 --> 09:10.205
I'm willing to give it a go.

09:12.307 --> 09:14.442
[♪♪]

09:14.442 --> 09:16.578
[Cecil] The Child, Family,
Community Service Act,

09:16.578 --> 09:17.645
Section 13--

09:17.645 --> 09:19.080
a child needs protection

09:19.080 --> 09:20.815
if the child has been,
or is likely to be,

09:20.815 --> 09:22.317
physically harmed.

09:22.317 --> 09:24.085
If the child has been
or is likely to be

09:24.085 --> 09:25.386
physically harmed
due to neglect.

09:25.386 --> 09:27.455
If the child is deprived
of necessary health care,

09:27.455 --> 09:28.623
or is likely to be--

09:28.623 --> 09:30.892
Thanks, Cecil.
That's enough.

09:32.927 --> 09:35.730
Luce?
What are your thoughts?

09:37.932 --> 09:39.467
I think that before
you can advocate for them,

09:39.467 --> 09:40.502
you need to assure yourself

09:40.502 --> 09:42.303
that they're capable
of raising this baby,

09:42.303 --> 09:44.472
because whatever plan
you come up with--

09:44.472 --> 09:46.608
...Has to be bullet-proof,

09:46.608 --> 09:48.610
and one that we can advocate for
with no hesitation.

09:48.610 --> 09:51.513
Well, we'll need
to move quickly.

09:51.513 --> 09:54.582
Ellie looks like
she's gonna pop at any moment.

09:54.582 --> 09:56.851
Lucy, what will Child
Protection Services want to see?

09:56.851 --> 09:58.152
A structured interview,

09:58.152 --> 10:00.421
cognitive, adaptive behaviors,

10:00.421 --> 10:02.857
a home visit assessment,
collateral interviews--

10:02.857 --> 10:03.958
Well, let's start with
the psychological tests.

10:03.958 --> 10:07.195
If those go well,
we'll arrange a home visit.

10:07.195 --> 10:09.063
Sounds good.

10:09.063 --> 10:10.965
Do the collateral interviews,

10:10.965 --> 10:12.033
and see if you can
find out the nature

10:12.033 --> 10:14.035
of the complaint
from the Ministry's lawyer.

10:14.035 --> 10:16.371
Mm. And what are you doing?

10:16.371 --> 10:18.039
Delegating to my junior.

10:18.039 --> 10:21.009
I have other cases
that need my attention.

10:21.009 --> 10:22.343
[slurping]

10:22.343 --> 10:23.878
What is that?
Diarrhea in a jar?

10:26.748 --> 10:28.950
Danielle and I
are on a cleanse.

10:32.186 --> 10:35.189
All right. Ahem. Let's go.

10:35.189 --> 10:38.059
Oh, I don't know
if Daniel would want me to--

10:38.059 --> 10:39.961
Cecil, come.

10:45.033 --> 10:46.200
They're great kids.

10:46.200 --> 10:48.002
Always on time,

10:48.002 --> 10:50.104
their uniforms washed
and ironed.

10:50.104 --> 10:51.639
Had to have a talk with Levi

10:51.639 --> 10:54.509
about personal hygiene
at the beginning,

10:54.509 --> 10:55.944
but never had to have it again.

10:55.944 --> 10:57.912
Have you ever heard them argue?

10:57.912 --> 11:00.315
[chuckles]
Ellie got mad at Levi one time

11:00.315 --> 11:02.116
for eating
too much rice pudding.

11:03.184 --> 11:04.452
Other than that...

11:04.452 --> 11:06.187
no.

11:06.187 --> 11:07.822
They're very sweet
with each other.

11:07.822 --> 11:11.192
Would you say they're capable
of raising a child?

11:11.192 --> 11:13.661
I've got a kid.

11:13.661 --> 11:16.564
I'm sure he wouldn't say
I'm great.

11:16.564 --> 11:19.200
How do you even
judge these things?

11:21.736 --> 11:24.405
[♪♪]

11:27.475 --> 11:29.877
[Ellie] I hate tests.

11:29.877 --> 11:32.714
Me too, but just think of it
as a conversation.

11:32.714 --> 11:34.282
We can take as long as we want.

11:34.282 --> 11:35.583
Can we have snacks?

11:35.583 --> 11:36.584
Of course.

11:36.584 --> 11:37.585
Including Babybels?

11:37.585 --> 11:39.787
[laughs] Sure thing.

11:39.787 --> 11:42.056
Why don't we start with you
telling me your morning routine?

11:42.056 --> 11:43.224
What time do you get up?

11:43.224 --> 11:44.993
7:00 a.m.

11:44.993 --> 11:46.628
We both set alarms.

11:46.628 --> 11:50.732
I have the first shower
and Levi makes us breakfast.

11:50.732 --> 11:54.135
And then
I have the second shower.

11:54.135 --> 11:58.072
And I make sure
that he puts on deodorant,

11:58.072 --> 11:59.574
because if he doesn't,

11:59.574 --> 12:01.142
pee-eww!

12:01.142 --> 12:03.611
[laughs]

12:06.748 --> 12:08.082
[Abigail]
That's the Ministry lawyer?

12:08.082 --> 12:09.417
Don Sargent, yeah,

12:09.417 --> 12:11.185
but maybe we should make
an appointment.

12:11.185 --> 12:12.620
No, no. Sometimes you get
more information

12:12.620 --> 12:14.455
if you catch somebody off-guard.

12:14.455 --> 12:15.423
Yeah, but I mean--

12:17.025 --> 12:18.259
What are you doing?

12:18.259 --> 12:20.028
Yeah, yeah, hashtag "me too,"
"time's up," yada yada.

12:20.028 --> 12:22.397
The truth is,
most men are still animals.

12:23.431 --> 12:24.432
But Don isn't--

12:24.432 --> 12:25.433
[Abigail] Don Sargent?

12:25.433 --> 12:26.300
Yes?

12:27.368 --> 12:29.637
[whispering] "D-A-W-N."

12:31.272 --> 12:32.707
I, uh...

12:32.707 --> 12:35.343
represent
Ellie and Levi Davies.

12:35.343 --> 12:36.277
I'm Abigail Bianchi.

12:36.277 --> 12:38.479
I know who you are.

12:39.981 --> 12:41.015
I'm here to find out

12:41.015 --> 12:42.450
the exact nature
of the complaint

12:42.450 --> 12:43.818
their neighbour made
against my clients.

12:43.818 --> 12:45.620
Nice try, Nancy Drew.

12:45.620 --> 12:47.422
I'm not telling you
who made the complaint.

12:47.422 --> 12:48.489
That's confidential information.

12:48.489 --> 12:50.992
I suspect even you know that.

12:54.095 --> 12:56.631
I take it
you're a second-wave feminist?

12:59.534 --> 13:01.569
[♪♪]

13:09.577 --> 13:14.082
[♪♪]

13:14.082 --> 13:16.918
-Luce!
-Mm-hmm?

13:16.918 --> 13:18.286
I'm ovulating.

13:19.687 --> 13:21.355
My mucus

13:21.355 --> 13:22.657
is clear

13:22.657 --> 13:23.991
and stretchy.

13:23.991 --> 13:26.894
Oh, God,
I'm gonna barf up my bagel.

13:26.894 --> 13:28.663
I'm just trying to learn
the ins and outs

13:28.663 --> 13:30.331
of my ovulation schedule.

13:30.331 --> 13:32.500
For future reference.

13:32.500 --> 13:33.668
[chuckles]

13:33.668 --> 13:34.669
And speaking of which,

13:34.669 --> 13:36.571
you promised you'd sit down
with me this week

13:36.571 --> 13:38.906
to look at
the donor profiles.

13:38.906 --> 13:40.608
-[phone rings]
-Ahem.

13:40.608 --> 13:42.009
[beep]

13:42.009 --> 13:44.045

13:44.045 --> 13:45.079
[Abigail]
<i> How were Ellie and Levi's</i>

13:45.079 --> 13:46.147
test results?

13:46.147 --> 13:47.749
<i> They scored "adequate"</i>
<i> or "moderately high"</i>

13:47.749 --> 13:48.883
<i> in most areas.</i>

13:48.883 --> 13:50.785
<i> We'll determine more</i>
<i> with the home visit.</i>

13:50.785 --> 13:52.286
How did your interviews go?

13:52.286 --> 13:53.421
<i> Uh, well,</i>

13:53.421 --> 13:54.922
with the exception
of their neighbour,

13:54.922 --> 13:57.425
people speak highly of them.

13:57.425 --> 13:58.693
<i> But?</i>

13:58.693 --> 14:00.294
But...

14:00.294 --> 14:01.896
being a parent's
the hardest job

14:01.896 --> 14:03.664
<i> I've ever had.</i>
<i> -It's only hard</i>

14:03.664 --> 14:05.233
'cause you suck at it.

14:05.233 --> 14:07.502
Was that my niece?

14:08.769 --> 14:10.271
Technically, yes.

14:10.271 --> 14:12.373
Wait, are you talking
to my aunt?

14:12.373 --> 14:13.741
Hi, Aunt Lucy!

14:13.741 --> 14:15.076
Hi, Nico.

14:15.076 --> 14:17.445
<i> I only just found out</i>
<i> I even had an aunt!</i>

14:17.445 --> 14:19.280
<i> How come we never met?</i>

14:19.280 --> 14:21.282
We'll talk about that later.
Sweetie, where's your monkey?

14:21.282 --> 14:22.884
I left him at home.

14:22.884 --> 14:24.652
-Oh.
-See you.

14:24.652 --> 14:25.953
-Bye!
-Bye.

14:25.953 --> 14:27.588
-Love you.
-You too.

14:27.588 --> 14:29.457
That was cute.

14:29.457 --> 14:30.558
<i> Yeah!</i>

14:30.558 --> 14:33.094
I have one demon seed
and one sweetheart.

14:43.070 --> 14:45.106

14:45.106 --> 14:47.141
[♪♪]

14:48.209 --> 14:49.610
Come on in.

14:50.678 --> 14:53.080
[♪♪]

14:55.983 --> 14:58.286
Ellie's in the living room.

14:58.286 --> 15:00.788
Thanks.

15:02.023 --> 15:03.558
Hi.

15:03.558 --> 15:07.562
Hi! I'm, uh, I'm Karen,
Ellie's sister.

15:07.562 --> 15:08.596
Abigail.

15:08.596 --> 15:09.864
-I'm Lucy.
-Hi.

15:09.864 --> 15:12.834
She's with
Doctors Without Borders.

15:12.834 --> 15:13.868
As a doctor!

15:13.868 --> 15:16.337
Ellie said you travel a lot
for work.

15:16.337 --> 15:19.373
Yeah, I'm here for a few weeks
before I have to head off again.

15:19.373 --> 15:21.309
Hoping to be here
for the big day.

15:23.544 --> 15:25.079
I know it's easier said
than done,

15:25.079 --> 15:27.281
but try and go about
your normal routine, okay?

15:27.281 --> 15:28.549
Okay.

15:28.549 --> 15:30.484
You guys want a sandwich?

15:31.519 --> 15:32.653
-Sure.
-Sure.

15:32.653 --> 15:34.055
You have a choice

15:34.055 --> 15:35.790
of ham...

15:35.790 --> 15:37.358
or ham.

15:37.358 --> 15:38.726
[Ellie laughs]

15:38.726 --> 15:40.127
That was a joke.

15:40.127 --> 15:41.128
[Lucy laughs]

15:41.128 --> 15:43.064
We'll both have ham.

15:45.433 --> 15:47.668
Okay.

15:47.668 --> 15:49.403
Are you hungry?
Do you want anything?

15:49.403 --> 15:51.739
[Lucy]
While Levi's making lunch,

15:51.739 --> 15:52.907
I thought we could chat.

15:52.907 --> 15:54.075
Ellie, you must be so happy

15:54.075 --> 15:56.510
to have your sister
here for a while.

15:58.145 --> 16:00.514
[♪♪]

16:25.740 --> 16:27.408
It's a boy.

16:27.408 --> 16:28.909
We already picked out a name.

16:30.244 --> 16:32.546
"Charlie." After my dad.

16:32.546 --> 16:34.615
That's a lovely name.

16:34.615 --> 16:36.484
[beeping]

16:38.886 --> 16:40.955
Um, Ellie, could I speak
with Levi's mom?

16:40.955 --> 16:41.922
Sure.

16:41.922 --> 16:43.924
-[beeping]
-Uh... I...

16:45.359 --> 16:47.795
Excuse me.

16:47.795 --> 16:48.796
[blowing air]

16:48.796 --> 16:50.364
What are you doing?

16:50.364 --> 16:51.432
[Breathalyzer beeps]

16:51.432 --> 16:53.401
Uh, it's just...

16:55.936 --> 17:00.741
It's something I need to do
if I want to see my kids.

17:00.741 --> 17:03.010
They took away your kids
from you, too?

17:04.145 --> 17:07.114
In a way, yes.

17:08.182 --> 17:10.151
That must hurt your heart.

17:10.151 --> 17:12.586
[♪♪]

17:20.928 --> 17:22.063
And lastly,

17:22.063 --> 17:23.931
affidavits with
the collateral interviews

17:23.931 --> 17:25.399
and the home-visit assessment.

17:25.399 --> 17:26.968
We think you'll find
the results encouraging.

17:26.968 --> 17:29.136
Levi's mother, Mary Davies,
has agreed

17:29.136 --> 17:31.906
to stay with the couple
as long as necessary.

17:32.973 --> 17:34.909
[quietly]
Have you spent time with Mary?

17:34.909 --> 17:37.111
I spoke with her at length
on the phone. Why?

17:37.111 --> 17:38.112
[glass clattering]

17:38.112 --> 17:40.081
Oh! Goodness. Sorry.

17:41.115 --> 17:43.184
I have good days
and bad days.

17:43.184 --> 17:47.321
My mom has Parkinson's,
like Muhammad Ali.

17:52.326 --> 17:54.562
I'm still able to help out,

17:54.562 --> 17:56.564
if that's what you're wondering.

17:57.798 --> 17:59.500
I'm sorry, but I must act

17:59.500 --> 18:01.168
in the best interests
of the child.

18:02.236 --> 18:03.537
I'll be applying to the courts

18:03.537 --> 18:05.306
to have the newborn
placed in care.

18:09.844 --> 18:13.180
[♪♪]

18:24.425 --> 18:26.160
-proof,

18:26.160 --> 18:28.262
and I got
gunned down immediately.

18:28.262 --> 18:31.065
How could you have not
known about the Parkinson's?

18:31.065 --> 18:33.000
I only talked to her
on the phone.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.268
You should've interviewed
the mother in person.

18:34.268 --> 18:35.269
Rookie mistake.

18:35.269 --> 18:37.071
Spare me the lecture, okay?

18:37.071 --> 18:38.806
You're paying me
a teensy fraction

18:38.806 --> 18:40.341
of what I made
at my old firm.

18:40.341 --> 18:42.009
And you think that gives you
the right to take shortcuts?

18:42.009 --> 18:43.611
Oh, f-- fudge you.

18:43.611 --> 18:45.813
I'm twice the lawyer you are.

18:45.813 --> 18:48.749
I have a 12-year call
to your, what, six?

18:48.749 --> 18:51.552
Seven. And yet you still
let Ellie and Levi down.

18:51.552 --> 18:52.820
You got their hopes up.

18:54.088 --> 18:55.823
They deserve better.

18:56.857 --> 18:58.392
I deserve better.

18:59.960 --> 19:02.363
You made me look like a fool.

19:03.697 --> 19:05.166
No. It's too easy.

19:05.166 --> 19:07.201
We go in front of the judge
in a few days,

19:07.201 --> 19:08.636
and right now
I'm not betting on our side.

19:08.636 --> 19:10.638
Hate to say I told you so.

19:10.638 --> 19:12.606
[in unison] Then don't.

19:17.545 --> 19:19.914
Do you know what a judge's
expectations are for parents?

19:19.914 --> 19:21.315
"Good enough."

19:21.315 --> 19:24.051
I think Ellie and Levi and Mary
provide at least that standard.

19:24.051 --> 19:26.153
We could still get a ruling
in their favour.

19:26.153 --> 19:27.521
The problem is,

19:27.521 --> 19:30.124
nobody knows if Ellie and Levi
are equipped to raise a child,

19:30.124 --> 19:31.392
including them.

19:31.392 --> 19:33.727
My mother said you can take
all the classes in the world,

19:33.727 --> 19:35.729
but nothing prepares you
for the harsh reality.

19:35.729 --> 19:36.997
Well, no.

19:36.997 --> 19:39.366
You're handed this
squirming, wailing alien

19:39.366 --> 19:41.735
who demands 24-7 care
and attention.

19:41.735 --> 19:43.771
I barely showered for a year.

19:43.771 --> 19:45.406
Yeah, my wife and I
didn't sleep for a decade

19:45.406 --> 19:46.740
with our three.

19:46.740 --> 19:47.842
[Harry] Really?

19:47.842 --> 19:50.578
I had three,
and I didn't find it that hard.

19:50.578 --> 19:52.213
Because your wives
did all the work.

19:55.816 --> 19:57.918
[Cecil]
My mother had five kids.

19:57.918 --> 20:00.187
Says she wishes
she stopped at four, though.

20:00.187 --> 20:02.056
[♪♪]

20:05.059 --> 20:07.228
They need to know
what it's actually like

20:07.228 --> 20:08.796
to take care of a baby.

20:09.864 --> 20:11.699
["infant" bawling]

20:11.699 --> 20:13.868
I think he needs changing.

20:15.002 --> 20:16.737
Or the bottle?

20:16.737 --> 20:18.472
Let's try changing.

20:18.472 --> 20:19.874
All right.

20:19.874 --> 20:21.275
[fussing and crying]

20:21.275 --> 20:23.544
Okay, that thing
is seriously creepy.

20:23.544 --> 20:24.778
Oh, tell me about it.

20:24.778 --> 20:26.013
I call him "Felix".

20:26.013 --> 20:27.581
He's an "infant simulator".

20:27.581 --> 20:28.582
Programmed with

20:28.582 --> 20:31.585
the recorded experiences
of actual babies.

20:33.921 --> 20:35.155
Okay.

20:35.155 --> 20:37.591
You'll be looking after him
for the next couple of days.

20:37.591 --> 20:39.693
The results will be
recorded and scored.

20:39.693 --> 20:43.564
So if you shake the baby,
it'll be recorded.

20:43.564 --> 20:44.999
If you drop the baby...

20:44.999 --> 20:46.567
It will be recorded.

20:46.567 --> 20:48.035
All the cameras are installed.

20:48.035 --> 20:49.003
[overlapping]
Thanks, Cecil.

20:50.804 --> 20:52.873
It's like being
on<i> Big Brother!</i>

20:52.873 --> 20:55.309
The video footage
is just back-up ammunition

20:55.309 --> 20:56.911
for when we're in front
of the judge.

20:56.911 --> 20:58.112
-[knocking]
-[Karen] Hello?

20:59.113 --> 21:00.114
Come in!

21:00.114 --> 21:01.682
-Hi.
-Hi.

21:01.682 --> 21:02.917
Hi.

21:04.084 --> 21:05.486
It's for the baby.

21:05.486 --> 21:06.487
I love it.

21:06.487 --> 21:07.955
["infant" cries]

21:07.955 --> 21:09.089
Hey...

21:09.089 --> 21:10.891
It's the bottle.

21:10.891 --> 21:13.193
It's definitely the bottle.

21:16.330 --> 21:17.731
[Maggie] Listen to this one.

21:17.731 --> 21:20.234
He's got a Master's
in Political Science

21:20.234 --> 21:21.101
from McGill.

21:21.101 --> 21:23.404
Speaks three languages.

21:23.404 --> 21:25.739
Oh. He's only 5'6".

21:25.739 --> 21:27.608
So?

21:27.608 --> 21:29.076
So, I want our child
to have a shot

21:29.076 --> 21:30.244
at playing basketball
in college,

21:30.244 --> 21:31.312
like I did.

21:31.312 --> 21:34.648
As fun as it is,
looking at donor profiles,

21:34.648 --> 21:37.451
it's also
"Dyke Night" at Velvet.

21:37.451 --> 21:39.320
Where do you get
the energy, Luce?

21:39.320 --> 21:40.854
I'm wiped.

21:40.854 --> 21:42.323
Ooh!

21:42.323 --> 21:44.592
This guy's 6'4".

21:45.693 --> 21:47.394
[Maggie laughs]

21:55.970 --> 21:57.137
[Joanne] It's so cute,

21:57.137 --> 21:59.673
watching you play
"Suzy Homemaker".

22:01.075 --> 22:02.076
[phone buzzes]

22:03.644 --> 22:05.279
Morning, "Pooh".

22:05.279 --> 22:06.313
Have you watched the footage?

22:06.313 --> 22:08.315
<i> All 24 hours of it, yes.</i>

22:08.315 --> 22:10.184
I only gave you your share.

22:10.184 --> 22:11.785
<i> Cecil watched the other 24.</i>

22:11.785 --> 22:13.454
He's a paralegal, Daniel.

22:13.454 --> 22:14.455
See you at the courthouse.

22:14.455 --> 22:15.956
Don't be late.

22:18.993 --> 22:21.195
Three words to describe
your brother. Go.

22:21.195 --> 22:22.796
Uh, arrogant.

22:22.796 --> 22:24.131
Narcissistic.

22:24.131 --> 22:26.700
And... is "anal-retentive"
one word or two?

22:26.700 --> 22:28.535
I'll allow it.
Your sister?

22:29.703 --> 22:32.506
Woke. Self-righteous.

22:32.506 --> 22:33.641
Daddy's girl.

22:33.641 --> 22:35.776
That's definitely four,
but I'll give it to you.

22:39.346 --> 22:41.815
You don't really believe
that those two

22:41.815 --> 22:44.151
are capable of raising a child,
do you?

22:45.185 --> 22:48.555
Parenting capacity
isn't measured by high I.Q.s.

22:48.555 --> 22:50.324
Look at you and Dad.

22:50.324 --> 22:53.060
Oh, come on.
We weren't that bad.

22:53.060 --> 22:54.728
Remember when I was six
and I ran away

22:54.728 --> 22:57.164
because I couldn't stand
your fighting?

22:57.164 --> 23:01.035
Neither one of you noticed
I was gone for a full 24 hours.

23:01.035 --> 23:02.836
Oh, cry me a river!

23:02.836 --> 23:04.605
We found you in the garage!

23:04.605 --> 23:08.075
You had a blanket
and plenty of snacks.

23:08.075 --> 23:10.511
Ellie and Levi
would be Ma and Pa Walton

23:10.511 --> 23:12.913
compared to you two.

23:12.913 --> 23:14.214
[smoke alarm beeping]

23:14.214 --> 23:15.649
Oh, dammit.

23:18.052 --> 23:21.221
And your "parenting capacity"?

23:21.221 --> 23:23.891
[♪♪]

23:24.925 --> 23:27.928
We're recommending
a kith-and-kin arrangement.

23:27.928 --> 23:29.029
Shared custody of the infant

23:29.029 --> 23:30.898
between Ellie and Levi,
and Levi's mother, Mary,

23:30.898 --> 23:33.200
with a full re-evaluation
in six months' time.

23:33.200 --> 23:36.370
Dr. Svensson, what is
your professional opinion?

23:36.370 --> 23:38.205
The Davies scored well
on their testing.

23:38.205 --> 23:39.873
I believe that,
with support from Mary,

23:39.873 --> 23:42.142
even with
her physical limitations,

23:42.142 --> 23:43.677
the child will be
in good hands.

23:43.677 --> 23:45.312
Ms. Sargent,
anything you'd like to add?

23:45.312 --> 23:47.114
Yes, Your Honour.

23:47.114 --> 23:49.249
With permission,
I'd like to play a section

23:49.249 --> 23:51.452
of the video recorded
at the Davies' residence.

23:51.452 --> 23:52.553
My team looked through
all that footage meticulously.

23:52.553 --> 23:53.787
I'm not sure
how this is relevant.

23:53.787 --> 23:56.256
I think
you'll want to see this.

23:56.256 --> 23:57.257
[Judge] Go ahead.

23:57.257 --> 23:58.158
[Dawn] We've edited

23:58.158 --> 24:01.095
the time sequence
of the footage.

24:01.095 --> 24:03.397
<i> ["Felix" crying]</i>

24:22.983 --> 24:25.519
[♪♪]

24:32.593 --> 24:37.664
I only left him in there
for a few hours

24:37.664 --> 24:39.533
so Ellie and I could sleep.

24:39.533 --> 24:41.168
[Ellie] He just wanted me

24:41.168 --> 24:44.004
to be well-rested
for when the real baby comes.

24:44.004 --> 24:47.508
We would never do that
to a real baby.

24:47.508 --> 24:50.511
[Dawn] Section 13 is clear.

24:50.511 --> 24:51.645
A child needs protecting

24:51.645 --> 24:53.647
if it has been,
or is likely to be,

24:53.647 --> 24:55.382
physically harmed
or neglected.

24:55.382 --> 24:56.650
But we have
safeguards in place.

24:56.650 --> 24:58.819
Mary Davies--
-...Has Parkinson's.

24:58.819 --> 25:00.220
What if she picks up the baby

25:00.220 --> 25:01.588
and has tremors
or impaired balance?

25:01.588 --> 25:03.357
Or what if
she gets hospitalized?

25:03.357 --> 25:06.660
Your Honour, we have to act in
the best interests of the child.

25:06.660 --> 25:07.728
[Ellie] Please!

25:07.728 --> 25:09.496
Don't take away our baby.

25:12.032 --> 25:13.834
I don't make
this decision lightly,

25:13.834 --> 25:15.836
but I do have to agree
with Ms. Sargent,

25:15.836 --> 25:17.137
there are
just too many unknowns.

25:19.173 --> 25:21.575
I hereby grant
temporary custody of the child

25:21.575 --> 25:22.609
to the Ministry.

25:25.579 --> 25:27.848
[Levi, cries out]
This isn't fair!

25:27.848 --> 25:28.982
[Ellie gasps]

25:28.982 --> 25:30.717
[water splashing]

25:30.717 --> 25:31.718
[Ellie sobs]

25:31.718 --> 25:33.954
I think I need to go
to the hospital.

25:33.954 --> 25:35.889
[Karen] Her water broke.

25:35.889 --> 25:38.392
[♪♪]

25:47.201 --> 25:48.869
I need a cab
to the courthouse.

25:50.204 --> 25:52.472
You have to help us!

25:52.472 --> 25:56.543
You know what it's like
to have your kids taken away.

25:57.611 --> 26:00.047
Please!

26:00.047 --> 26:01.481
How could you let this happen?

26:01.481 --> 26:02.516
What?

26:02.516 --> 26:03.884
Uh, that was not my footage.

26:03.884 --> 26:04.885
I saw the timecode.

26:04.885 --> 26:07.554
It wasn't my day,
it must've been yours.

26:07.554 --> 26:08.789
I'm gonna ask you one question,

26:08.789 --> 26:10.257
and you'd better
answer honestly.

26:10.257 --> 26:11.692
Are you drinking again?

26:11.692 --> 26:13.460
What? No!

26:13.460 --> 26:15.229
Well, I can't think
of another explanation

26:15.229 --> 26:16.430
for the sloppiness.

26:16.430 --> 26:19.633
Unless you're deliberately
trying to sabotage them...

26:19.633 --> 26:20.868
or me.

26:24.972 --> 26:25.939
Sorry.

26:29.776 --> 26:31.078
Are you drinking again?

26:31.078 --> 26:33.714
Go to hell.

26:33.714 --> 26:35.349
Seriously.

26:40.954 --> 26:43.590
[♪♪]

26:50.797 --> 26:52.499
You look terrible.

26:52.499 --> 26:54.434
Thank you, Mother.

26:54.434 --> 26:55.602
Did you get any sleep?

26:56.970 --> 26:58.438
I just don't get it.

26:58.438 --> 27:00.574
It's not there.

27:00.574 --> 27:02.876
[phone buzzing]

27:05.178 --> 27:06.313
What?

27:06.313 --> 27:08.482
I'm gonna stop by the hospital
on the way to work.

27:08.482 --> 27:09.683
See how Ellie's doing.

27:09.683 --> 27:12.486
How many cameras did we install
at Ellie and Levi's?

27:12.486 --> 27:14.588
<i> Uh... three.</i>

27:14.588 --> 27:15.589
One in the bedroom,

27:15.589 --> 27:16.924
two in the kitchen
and living area.

27:16.924 --> 27:19.459
<i> Do you want me</i>
<i> to keep you updated?</i>

27:19.459 --> 27:20.861
<i> Hello?</i>

"Our family...

27:29.836 --> 27:31.471

27:35.709 --> 27:38.178
That's it?

27:40.514 --> 27:41.815
[clapping]

27:41.815 --> 27:43.483
Brilliant. Clean.

27:43.483 --> 27:45.852
Succinct. Digestible.
Perfect new logo.

27:45.852 --> 27:47.554
[Danielle]
I'm glad you like it.

27:47.554 --> 27:49.656
Now, remember.
The photographer comes at 5:00.

27:49.656 --> 27:51.959
-Everybody will be ready.
-Great.

27:53.193 --> 27:54.561
Can't wait.

27:54.561 --> 27:55.896

[blows kiss]

27:57.464 --> 27:58.865
[door shuts]

27:58.865 --> 28:02.035
So, do you really think
Abigail dropped the ball?

28:03.070 --> 28:04.504
A wrecking ball.

28:05.739 --> 28:08.041
Like I said to you earlier--

28:08.041 --> 28:09.977
we're not running a charity.

28:09.977 --> 28:11.812
If she needs to go,
she needs to go.

28:11.812 --> 28:13.347
[phone buzzing]

28:13.347 --> 28:15.482
Speak of the she-devil.

28:17.250 --> 28:18.585
<i> It's not our footage.</i>

28:18.585 --> 28:20.053
What are you talking about?

28:20.053 --> 28:21.855
Let me slow it down
for you, Pooh.

28:21.855 --> 28:23.690
It's not our footage.

28:23.690 --> 28:25.826
Abby, just for once,
admit you made a mistake.

28:25.826 --> 28:27.427
<i> I didn't make a mistake.</i>

28:27.427 --> 28:30.697
It's from a different camera.
I'm gonna have to call you back.

28:30.697 --> 28:32.032
[knocks]

28:34.768 --> 28:35.902
You're late.

28:35.902 --> 28:37.237
Yeah, I'm aware of that.
Let's go.

28:37.237 --> 28:39.773
Dad already
drove Nico to school.

28:39.773 --> 28:41.575
Then why are you at home?

28:41.575 --> 28:42.776
I have a spare
Thursday mornings,

28:42.776 --> 28:44.678
which you would know,
if you were still

28:44.678 --> 28:46.213
part of this family...

28:46.213 --> 28:47.547
Abigail.

28:47.547 --> 28:50.884
Give it a rest, Sofia. Okay?

28:52.052 --> 28:53.954
Why can't you be more like Nico?

28:53.954 --> 28:56.356
He-He doesn't hold
my mistakes over me.

28:56.356 --> 28:58.392
He's moved on.
He's happy.

28:58.392 --> 29:00.093
Is that what you think?

29:00.093 --> 29:01.928
You so don't have a clue.

29:03.196 --> 29:05.232
Want to enlighten me?

29:06.600 --> 29:09.269
He begged me
not to tell you guys.

29:09.269 --> 29:11.271
Tell us what?

29:11.271 --> 29:13.874
He has this stupid idea that
if he doesn't rock the boat,

29:13.874 --> 29:15.609
you and Dad
will get back together.

29:15.609 --> 29:17.277
Well, I mean, you know
he's always been

29:17.277 --> 29:18.311
kind of a weirdo.

29:18.311 --> 29:20.213
-Sofia.
-Well, it's true!

29:20.213 --> 29:21.815
He could keep a low profile,

29:21.815 --> 29:23.517
until your stupid video
went viral.

29:23.517 --> 29:26.086
Now it's like he's got
a bull's-eye on his back.

29:26.086 --> 29:30.090
But I... I see him
with his friends

29:30.090 --> 29:30.957
when I drop him off.

29:30.957 --> 29:32.059
You think those boys
are his friends?

29:35.996 --> 29:37.030
You know what I think?

29:37.030 --> 29:38.932
I think you should
pee on your feet.

29:38.932 --> 29:41.301
Pee on your feet
like you're a monkey.

29:41.301 --> 29:42.302
I'm not going to do that.

29:42.302 --> 29:43.303
Just pee on your feet--

29:43.303 --> 29:44.471
[sinisterly] Listen,

29:44.471 --> 29:46.173
you little turd biscuit,
you touch my son again--

29:46.173 --> 29:49.309
you say one word to him,
you look at him funny--

29:49.309 --> 29:51.711
and I will destroy you.

29:54.614 --> 29:56.083
[whistle tweeting]

29:57.584 --> 30:00.554
[♪♪]

30:05.892 --> 30:07.961
[school bell rings]

30:09.096 --> 30:10.630
I did not hit him.

30:10.630 --> 30:12.432
Is that what he's saying?

30:12.432 --> 30:15.469
Frank, he's been tormenting Nico
for months.

30:15.469 --> 30:17.137
It-- Hello?

30:17.137 --> 30:18.572
Hello?

30:20.040 --> 30:22.142
[♪♪]

30:46.199 --> 30:48.668
[♪♪]

31:07.554 --> 31:09.189
Karen.

31:09.189 --> 31:11.191
Baby was born an hour ago.

31:11.191 --> 31:12.726
We're just waiting
for the social worker.

31:12.726 --> 31:13.927
How could you do it?

31:13.927 --> 31:15.362
I'm sorry. What?

31:15.362 --> 31:16.429
I know it was you.

31:16.429 --> 31:18.498
You phoned in the complaint.

31:19.599 --> 31:20.934
It's not that simple--

31:20.934 --> 31:23.170
And your teddy bear,
your "gift"...

31:23.170 --> 31:25.272
had a nanny cam?

31:25.272 --> 31:27.073
If you'd like me to explain,
I'd be happy--

31:27.073 --> 31:28.041
Oh, please do.

31:29.109 --> 31:30.744
Because I can't,
for the life of me,

31:30.744 --> 31:33.446
figure out why anyone would
do that to their own sister.

31:33.446 --> 31:34.447
[footsteps approaching]

31:34.447 --> 31:36.383
Have you seen Ellie or Levi?

31:36.383 --> 31:37.284
No. Why?

31:37.284 --> 31:39.052
They're gone.

31:39.052 --> 31:41.855
Ellie and Levi and the baby--
they're gone.

31:41.855 --> 31:44.024
[♪♪]

31:52.666 --> 31:53.967
The most likely explanation

31:53.967 --> 31:55.635
is that they're somewhere
right here, in the hospital.

31:55.635 --> 31:58.238
Yeah, well, why don't you
stay here in case they show up,

31:58.238 --> 31:59.639
and I'll drive to their place?

31:59.639 --> 32:02.943
If they did manage to slip out,
that's probably where they went.

32:02.943 --> 32:04.144
Yeah, well, if we can
find them soon,

32:04.144 --> 32:05.979
maybe we can avoid getting
the authorities involved.

32:07.647 --> 32:10.250
Oh, no, no, no.
You're comin' with me.

32:14.521 --> 32:16.523
I know you think
I'm a terrible person.

32:16.523 --> 32:17.891
You said it, not me.

32:17.891 --> 32:20.460
I love Ellie more than
anyone else in the world.

32:20.460 --> 32:21.862
Funny way of showing it.

32:21.862 --> 32:24.297
Would you just
listen to me, okay?

32:24.297 --> 32:26.833
I understand
my sister's limitations.

32:26.833 --> 32:29.102
I know that she is impulsive

32:29.102 --> 32:30.770
and she gets bored easily.

32:30.770 --> 32:33.206
Once, she had this gerbil,
and she loved that thing,

32:33.206 --> 32:35.208
and I went away
to summer camp for one week,

32:35.208 --> 32:37.544
and Ellie forgot to feed it,
and it died.

32:37.544 --> 32:41.281
So you think she'd treat a baby
like she would a gerbil,

32:41.281 --> 32:43.183
what, almost 20 years ago?

32:43.183 --> 32:44.684
There's more to it
than that.

32:44.684 --> 32:47.854
I have been getting texts
every day from her neighbour,

32:47.854 --> 32:49.189
while I was in Libya,

32:49.189 --> 32:51.691
telling me all of this stuff,
like things that she had seen.

32:51.691 --> 32:53.159
And you believed her?

32:53.159 --> 32:55.328
I didn't know what to believe!

32:55.328 --> 32:57.931
All I knew is that,
if something happened,

32:57.931 --> 33:01.167
it wouldn't just be the baby
that would suffer,

33:01.167 --> 33:02.802
it was gonna be Ellie, too.

33:02.802 --> 33:05.205
Please, just...

33:05.205 --> 33:06.840
don't tell her I'm the one
that made the call.

33:06.840 --> 33:08.808
She would never forgive me.

33:11.578 --> 33:13.179
You know what? I won't.

33:13.179 --> 33:14.881
For her sake.

33:14.881 --> 33:18.385
She's had enough heartbreak
already.

33:18.385 --> 33:19.719
A-And just so we're clear--

33:19.719 --> 33:21.588
that "baby"
you keep referring to,

33:21.588 --> 33:22.822
he's your nephew.

33:22.822 --> 33:24.891
You're his aunt.

33:24.891 --> 33:27.761
And you just put Charlie
into the system.

33:27.761 --> 33:29.396
If he's lucky,

33:29.396 --> 33:32.599
he'll get adopted
into a loving family, but...

33:32.599 --> 33:36.169
the odds aren't in his favour,
Auntie Karen.

33:37.404 --> 33:38.371
[phone ringing]

33:40.740 --> 33:42.609
Sofia? What's up?

33:42.609 --> 33:44.110
Mom?

33:44.110 --> 33:45.912
You'd better come home...

33:45.912 --> 33:47.414
now.

33:47.414 --> 33:49.916
[♪♪]

33:55.121 --> 33:57.457
[♪♪]

33:57.457 --> 33:59.592
So you're really my aunt?

33:59.592 --> 34:00.927
And you're really my niece.

34:00.927 --> 34:04.564
I can't believe you and my mom
share any of the same DNA.

34:04.564 --> 34:05.565
[Karen] Ellie...

34:05.565 --> 34:06.933
Ellie.

34:06.933 --> 34:08.368
They said they looked up
your name online,

34:08.368 --> 34:10.270
and this is the address
that popped up.

34:10.270 --> 34:11.338
[Abby]
Let me get this straight.

34:11.338 --> 34:12.739
You answered the door
to strangers,

34:12.739 --> 34:13.807
but, more importantly,

34:13.807 --> 34:16.409
you were home
to answer the door to strangers

34:16.409 --> 34:18.211
because you weren't at school
all day?

34:18.211 --> 34:20.246
It's probably
a good thing she was here,

34:20.246 --> 34:22.148
wouldn't you say?

34:22.148 --> 34:24.684
Thank you... Auntie.

34:26.720 --> 34:27.687
[text alert chimes]

34:31.458 --> 34:34.394
The Ministry social worker
is on his way.

34:35.462 --> 34:38.131
Would you like to hold him,
just once?

34:38.131 --> 34:42.235
[♪♪]

34:52.579 --> 34:54.314
You have to promise

34:54.314 --> 34:58.084
he'll go to people
who love him.

34:58.084 --> 35:02.322
[♪♪]

35:07.427 --> 35:09.662
[Levi sobbing]

35:09.662 --> 35:12.098
[♪♪]

35:26.112 --> 35:27.680
Mr. Svensson,

35:27.680 --> 35:29.949
this emergency motion
had better be worth my time.

35:29.949 --> 35:31.518
I'm late for a date
with a decent man,

35:31.518 --> 35:32.986
and that, at my age,
defies the odds.

35:32.986 --> 35:34.687
We'll get through this
quickly, then.

35:34.687 --> 35:35.722
Good.

35:35.722 --> 35:37.757
Ellie's sister, Karen,
has stepped forward

35:37.757 --> 35:39.025
as a new caregiver for Charlie.

35:39.025 --> 35:41.394
We've drawn up a new
kith-and-kin custody arrangement

35:41.394 --> 35:43.797
that includes Ellie and Levi,
and Karen and Mary.

35:43.797 --> 35:45.231
Ah, it takes a village.

35:45.231 --> 35:47.834
I thought you had
to travel a lot with your work

35:47.834 --> 35:48.902
as a doctor?

35:48.902 --> 35:51.204
I do. I... did.

35:52.372 --> 35:56.142
It was always my plan
to open up a local practice.

35:56.142 --> 35:59.145
It's just gonna happen a couple
of years ahead of schedule.

35:59.145 --> 36:01.548
Well, we like to keep families
together wherever possible.

36:01.548 --> 36:04.384
Ms. Sargent,
do you have anything to add?

36:04.384 --> 36:05.585
I do, Your Honour.

36:05.585 --> 36:08.054
I'd like you to consider
the child when it gets older.

36:08.054 --> 36:09.823
What happens then?

36:09.823 --> 36:11.391
It's not gonna take him long

36:11.391 --> 36:13.193
to realize that his parents
are different from him,

36:13.193 --> 36:15.028
that he is more capable
than they are.

36:15.028 --> 36:18.331
Imagine the first parent/teacher
night in high school.

36:18.331 --> 36:19.732
You know the way teenagers are.

36:19.732 --> 36:20.934
He'll be ridiculed.

36:20.934 --> 36:22.702
[Abby] You're not a parent,
are you?

36:22.702 --> 36:24.404
I'm sorry, I don't see
the relevance of that.

36:24.404 --> 36:25.738
Oh, because if you were,

36:25.738 --> 36:27.407
you would know
that every single teenager

36:27.407 --> 36:29.108
is embarrassed
by their parents.

36:29.108 --> 36:31.377
Ellie and Levi love their child.

36:31.377 --> 36:32.879
Mary loves her grandson.

36:32.879 --> 36:35.014
Karen loves her nephew.

36:35.014 --> 36:38.618
You can't bottle that
and sell it.

36:38.618 --> 36:40.854
The four of them combined,

36:40.854 --> 36:42.422
they're gonna be
better parents to Charlie

36:42.422 --> 36:46.159
than most of those
so-called "normal" parents

36:46.159 --> 36:47.360
you keep referring to.

36:47.360 --> 36:50.597
You tell 'em, Ms. Bianchi!

36:50.597 --> 36:51.965
[Judge] Okay. Thank you

36:51.965 --> 36:53.967
for that entertaining,
yet entirely unnecessary

36:53.967 --> 36:55.435
diatribe.

36:55.435 --> 36:56.870
I'm happy
with this arrangement.

36:56.870 --> 36:59.906
I'll make a temporary order,
to review in three months' time.

36:59.906 --> 37:00.974
Ellie and Levi?

37:00.974 --> 37:03.042
I wish you both
the very best of luck.

37:03.042 --> 37:05.011
Thank you, Your Majesty.

37:05.011 --> 37:07.013
[chuckles]
Oh, thank you!

37:09.916 --> 37:12.385
[♪♪]

37:12.385 --> 37:13.453
Thank you.

37:13.453 --> 37:15.054
Oh! [chuckles]

37:15.054 --> 37:17.323
For everything.

37:17.323 --> 37:21.461
I-I hope it works out with you
and your children, too.

37:22.562 --> 37:24.531
Thank you.

37:30.470 --> 37:32.605
I am ready for my apology.

37:32.605 --> 37:34.807
I'm ready for a Porsche,

37:34.807 --> 37:36.943
but that's not
going to happen, either.

37:38.111 --> 37:39.846
[Lucy chuckles]

37:39.846 --> 37:42.081
That "diatribe"
sounded pretty personal.

37:43.149 --> 37:45.184
Sofia is lovely,
by the way.

37:45.184 --> 37:47.687
Yeah, when she's not
being a total banshee,

37:47.687 --> 37:49.455
she's awesome.

37:49.455 --> 37:52.492
You helped come up with
that kith-and-kin agreement.

37:52.492 --> 37:55.328
You clearly
understand the importance

37:55.328 --> 37:57.597
of extended family
in a child's life.

37:57.597 --> 38:00.166
Subtlety
is not your strong suit.

38:00.166 --> 38:02.101
Dad has mentioned to me
more than once

38:02.101 --> 38:03.770
that he'd like
to meet his grandkids.

38:03.770 --> 38:04.871
Yes, but I don't think

38:04.871 --> 38:07.106
you're the one he should
be talking to, are you?

38:07.106 --> 38:09.108
And I would like to get to know
my niece and nephew.

38:09.108 --> 38:12.045
You just don't stop, do you?

38:12.045 --> 38:14.814
Let me work on my relationship
with them first, okay?

38:14.814 --> 38:17.283
Okay.

38:17.283 --> 38:18.851
[♪♪]

38:18.851 --> 38:20.119
No, we're not. No.

38:24.958 --> 38:27.160
[knocking]

38:27.160 --> 38:28.695
I talked to Daniel--

38:28.695 --> 38:30.964
Whatever he said,
I did good work on this file.

38:30.964 --> 38:33.032
That's what he said.

38:33.032 --> 38:34.601
Oh.

38:34.601 --> 38:36.369
Okay, well, good.

38:36.369 --> 38:39.205
Does this mean I can
get my own files now?

38:39.205 --> 38:41.708
No, but you can read through
these briefs for me

38:41.708 --> 38:42.875
and summarize them.

38:42.875 --> 38:44.210
I'll need them by Monday.

38:44.210 --> 38:45.678
[thud]

38:45.678 --> 38:47.180
My talents are wasted here.

38:47.180 --> 38:49.349
Be thankful for the job,
Abigail.

38:52.619 --> 38:54.754
Are you wearing makeup?

38:54.754 --> 38:56.956
[♪♪]

38:58.424 --> 39:00.994
Okay, if you all
stand over here...

39:02.028 --> 39:04.897
Uh, you know I don't
actually work here, right?

39:04.897 --> 39:06.399
No, but we can link
to your services,

39:06.399 --> 39:07.467
and we want this photo

39:07.467 --> 39:09.002
to represent
the new face of the firm.

39:09.002 --> 39:10.336
i.e., not just a white face.

39:10.336 --> 39:11.471
This photo should say

39:11.471 --> 39:14.707
that "we are open--
for business, and in attitude."

39:14.707 --> 39:16.075
Exactly. Perfect.

39:18.778 --> 39:20.880
[knocking]

39:20.880 --> 39:23.182
I'm just headed out, so...

39:24.217 --> 39:27.286
We're taking the new photo
for the firm's website.

39:27.286 --> 39:28.921
Shouldn't Abigail be in it?

39:30.456 --> 39:31.991
Just give us a minute,
would you, Jerri?

39:38.131 --> 39:40.867
Abigail,
given your current...

39:40.867 --> 39:42.135
infamy,

39:42.135 --> 39:44.137
your presence on the website

39:44.137 --> 39:45.905
could do the firm
more harm than good.

39:45.905 --> 39:48.474
I'm sure you understand.

39:48.474 --> 39:49.942
Yeah.

39:49.942 --> 39:52.078
I get it.

39:52.078 --> 39:54.914
I'm just counting the days
until I'm out of here.

39:55.982 --> 39:58.117
Besides, I've never been
in your family photos.

39:59.318 --> 40:01.587
Why start now?

40:05.792 --> 40:08.227
[♪♪]
