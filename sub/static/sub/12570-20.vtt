08:06.083 --> 08:07.772
Well, I am a great

08:07.773 --> 08:09.459
conversationalist.

08:09.500 --> 08:10.751
Plus, you've had

08:10.752 --> 08:12.000
a ton of coffee.

08:15.083 --> 08:17.042
You know, Serena,

08:17.083 --> 08:18.167
I feel like I could

08:18.168 --> 08:19.250
talk to you forever.

08:20.334 --> 08:22.125
Bertram?

08:22.167 --> 08:23.584
I don't know what

08:23.585 --> 08:25.000
disturbs me more,

08:25.042 --> 08:26.042
that you're talking

08:26.043 --> 08:27.043
to a coffee maker,

08:27.083 --> 08:28.605
or that this isn't

08:28.606 --> 08:30.125
the weirdest thing

08:27.083 --> 08:30.125
I've ever caught you doing.

08:31.500 --> 08:32.688
This isn't just any

08:32.690 --> 08:33.876
coffee maker.

08:33.918 --> 08:35.126
This is Serena.

08:35.126 --> 08:36.333
She speaks,

08:36.375 --> 08:38.208
she brews,

08:38.210 --> 08:40.042
she enchants.

08:40.082 --> 08:41.772
Oh, hello, Luke.

08:41.773 --> 08:43.458
Ravi programed

08:40.082 --> 08:43.458
me all about you.

08:43.500 --> 08:45.042
- How is Spanish
- class coming?

08:45.083 --> 08:46.522
Terrible. If I don't

08:46.523 --> 08:47.959
pass this next test

08:48.000 --> 08:49.022
I'm going to

08:49.023 --> 08:50.042
flunk-o

08:48.000 --> 08:50.042
el class-o.

08:50.083 --> 08:52.375
(SERENA TALKING IN SPANISH)

08:54.083 --> 08:55.563
Wait, you

08:55.564 --> 08:57.042
speak Spanish?

08:57.083 --> 08:58.083
Of course. I was

08:58.084 --> 08:59.084
made in Colombia.

08:59.125 --> 09:00.626
Just check my label.

09:00.667 --> 09:02.000
Don't you dare!

09:04.083 --> 09:05.501
Bertram, I just

09:05.502 --> 09:06.918
had a great idea.

09:06.959 --> 09:09.042
- Since Ravi gave up
- trying to teach me Spanish,

09:09.083 --> 09:10.500
- Maybe I can
- borrow Serena

09:10.542 --> 09:11.959
- And she can
- help tutor me.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.500
No way! She's mine.

09:14.542 --> 09:15.980
Come on, Serena.

09:15.981 --> 09:17.417
Let's go change

09:14.542 --> 09:17.417
your filter.

09:17.459 --> 09:19.500
Don't worry, I'll look away.

09:23.626 --> 09:25.334
Okay, Ravi, you

09:25.335 --> 09:27.042
dragged me away

09:23.626 --> 09:27.042
from doing homework...

09:27.083 --> 09:29.083
Thanks, by the way.

09:29.125 --> 09:30.542
So, what do you want?

09:30.584 --> 09:32.063
Jessie has decided

09:32.064 --> 09:33.542
to take you

09:30.584 --> 09:33.542
to the concert,

09:33.584 --> 09:34.584
because you

09:34.585 --> 09:35.585
are her favorite.

09:35.626 --> 09:38.167
Well, that makes sense.

09:38.209 --> 09:39.564
She said to bring you

09:39.565 --> 09:40.918
here for a meet and greet

09:40.959 --> 09:43.042
with Mr. Timberlake.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.792
But what about the

09:44.793 --> 09:46.500
"No Trespassing" sign?

09:46.542 --> 09:48.167
- And that security
- guard whose

09:48.209 --> 09:49.209
Neck weighs more

09:49.210 --> 09:50.210
than my head?

09:51.459 --> 09:52.730
Jessie said that

09:52.731 --> 09:54.000
is for regular people,

09:54.042 --> 09:56.250
not a VIP like you.

09:56.292 --> 09:58.251
This VIP treatment

09:58.252 --> 10:00.209
should extend to

09:56.292 --> 10:00.209
the playground slide.

10:00.250 --> 10:01.918
I'm sick and tired

10:01.919 --> 10:03.584
of going after

10:00.250 --> 10:03.584
Skidmark Sanders.

10:09.083 --> 10:10.563
Hey, wait, I'm

10:10.564 --> 10:12.042
supposed to be here.

10:12.083 --> 10:13.083
If you don't let

10:13.084 --> 10:14.084
me go, JT is gonna

10:14.125 --> 10:15.168
Rock Your Body

10:15.169 --> 10:16.209
with his fists!

10:17.459 --> 10:19.167
Aww.

10:19.209 --> 10:21.188
Did somebody think

10:21.189 --> 10:23.167
Jessie was going to

10:19.209 --> 10:23.167
give her a wristband?

10:23.209 --> 10:24.230
Mister Muscles,

10:24.231 --> 10:25.250
Mister Biceps,

10:25.292 --> 10:26.709
her name is Zuri Ross,

10:26.710 --> 10:28.125
known trespasser.

10:30.083 --> 10:31.542
Feel free to pass

10:31.543 --> 10:33.000
these around to your

10:30.083 --> 10:33.000
fellow Neanderthals.

10:34.417 --> 10:36.042
Carry me over there!

10:36.083 --> 10:38.000
I wanna kick their butts!

10:40.125 --> 10:42.042
More spring water, dear?

10:42.083 --> 10:43.584
Please.

10:43.626 --> 10:46.167
Mmm...

10:46.209 --> 10:47.876
Bertram, I've had such

10:47.877 --> 10:49.542
a wonderful afternoon.

10:49.584 --> 10:50.855
Ravi gave me

10:50.856 --> 10:52.125
a lot of data

10:49.584 --> 10:52.125
about you, but

10:52.167 --> 10:53.605
he never

10:53.606 --> 10:55.042
said you were

10:52.167 --> 10:55.042
such a romantic.

10:55.083 --> 10:57.042
- And the day's
- not over yet.

10:57.083 --> 10:59.063
After dinner, I'll give

10:59.064 --> 11:01.042
you a nice bubble

10:57.083 --> 11:01.042
bath in the sink.

11:01.083 --> 11:02.605
Do you prefer clean citrus

11:02.606 --> 11:04.125
or de-greasing non-scented?

11:04.167 --> 11:05.917
(LAUGHING) Whatever

11:05.918 --> 11:07.667
you want.

11:07.709 --> 11:10.042
You know, Bertram,

11:10.043 --> 11:12.375
I really like you a "latte."

11:12.417 --> 11:14.000
Oh! (LAUGHING)

11:15.083 --> 11:17.000
I like you a "latte" too.

11:21.626 --> 11:23.292
What are you staring at?

11:23.334 --> 11:25.042
- You act like you've
- never seen a guy

11:25.083 --> 11:26.042
- And his coffee
- maker having

11:25.083 --> 11:26.083
A picnic!

11:29.125 --> 11:30.418
Oh! Look at

11:30.419 --> 11:31.709
the beautiful daisies.

11:31.751 --> 11:32.810
- I'm going to go
- pick you one.

11:32.834 --> 11:34.147
It'll really set

11:34.148 --> 11:35.459
off your handle.

11:35.500 --> 11:36.772
Hurry back, you hot

11:36.773 --> 11:38.042
cup of handsome!

11:38.083 --> 11:39.667
(BOTH LAUGHING)

11:44.083 --> 11:46.042
Hey! What are you...

11:46.083 --> 11:47.375
(MUFFLED SCREAMING)

11:51.083 --> 11:52.334
What?

11:52.375 --> 11:56.042
Serena? Serena?

11:56.083 --> 11:57.542
Help! Help! I've been

11:57.543 --> 11:59.000
coffee mugged.

12:02.542 --> 12:03.751
Thank you! Thank you!

12:03.792 --> 12:05.459
- (GASPS) It's here,
- it's here!

12:05.500 --> 12:06.772
I assume by your joy

12:06.773 --> 12:08.042
that man was not delivering

12:08.083 --> 12:10.083
Luke's report card.

12:10.125 --> 12:12.042
Nope. This envelope holds two

12:12.083 --> 12:13.855
all-access

12:13.856 --> 12:15.626
wristbands to the

12:12.083 --> 12:15.626
Justin Timberlake concert.

12:15.667 --> 12:16.834
And Luke always

12:16.835 --> 12:18.000
intercepts his report cards.

12:20.083 --> 12:22.417
What? Only one wristband?

12:24.584 --> 12:26.522
Oh, no. My ex

12:26.523 --> 12:28.459
says this is the

12:24.584 --> 12:28.459
best he can do.

12:28.500 --> 12:29.685
- Do you know
- what this means?

12:29.709 --> 12:31.083
- You have to tell
- Emma and Zuri

12:31.125 --> 12:32.168
Neither one of them

12:32.169 --> 12:33.209
can attend with you?

12:33.250 --> 12:34.626
No, it means I have

12:34.627 --> 12:36.000
to sneak out without

12:33.250 --> 12:36.000
them spotting me.

12:37.125 --> 12:39.125
Hey, I'd be a bad nanny

12:39.167 --> 12:40.605
if I let one of

12:40.606 --> 12:42.042
them go to a concert

12:39.167 --> 12:42.042
all by herself.

12:42.083 --> 12:44.709
Plus, I really wanna go!

12:44.751 --> 12:46.105
Jessie, the best

12:46.106 --> 12:47.459
thing to do

12:44.751 --> 12:47.459
is be honest.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.042
Just get it over with.

12:49.083 --> 12:50.500
Rip that bandage off.

12:50.542 --> 12:52.334
- I ripped a bandage
- off Zuri yesterday,

12:52.375 --> 12:54.000
- And she punched
- me in the knee!

12:57.083 --> 12:58.209
- I deserve
- that wristband!

12:58.250 --> 12:59.876
- You got to go
- to the last concert

12:59.918 --> 13:00.918
And I had to stay home.

13:00.959 --> 13:02.876
It was Ravi's sitar recital

13:02.918 --> 13:04.001
and you faked an

13:04.002 --> 13:05.083
illness to get out of it!

13:05.125 --> 13:06.959
I did not! Flu-nesia

13:06.960 --> 13:08.792
is a real thing!

13:10.667 --> 13:12.834
Hey, there is no point

13:12.835 --> 13:15.000
in bickering any longer

13:10.667 --> 13:15.000
about the wristband.

13:16.209 --> 13:17.476
- Do you know
- something we don't?

13:17.500 --> 13:19.083
That is a loaded question.

13:19.125 --> 13:20.730
There is a

13:20.731 --> 13:22.334
lot I know that

13:19.125 --> 13:22.334
you do not.

13:22.375 --> 13:23.688
Oh, yeah? Your fly

13:23.689 --> 13:25.000
is down, genius.

13:25.876 --> 13:28.042
(ZIPPING)

13:28.083 --> 13:29.980
Anywho, you did

13:29.981 --> 13:31.876
not hear this from me,

13:31.918 --> 13:33.084
but Jessie only

13:33.085 --> 13:34.250
has one wristband

13:34.292 --> 13:36.042
- and she plans
- on using it herself.

13:36.083 --> 13:38.042
(GASPS) What?

13:38.083 --> 13:39.834
That big, lying

13:39.835 --> 13:41.584
Timber-fake!

13:41.626 --> 13:43.522
Come on, Zuri!

13:43.523 --> 13:45.417
Let's go 'N Sync our

13:41.626 --> 13:45.417
fists in her face!

13:45.459 --> 13:47.168
True, you could go

13:47.169 --> 13:48.876
and give Jessie a

13:45.459 --> 13:48.876
piece of your mind.

13:48.918 --> 13:50.876
Though, frankly,

13:50.877 --> 13:52.834
neither of you can

13:48.918 --> 13:52.834
really afford that.

13:52.876 --> 13:53.918
Well, what else are

13:53.919 --> 13:54.959
we supposed to do?

13:55.000 --> 13:56.271
If you really want to

13:56.272 --> 13:57.542
get Jessie back,

13:57.584 --> 13:58.731
you should join

13:58.732 --> 13:59.876
forces and ensure

13:59.918 --> 14:01.147
that if anyone is to

14:01.148 --> 14:02.375
see that concert,

14:02.417 --> 14:04.834
it will not be her.

14:04.876 --> 14:05.918
Great idea!

14:05.919 --> 14:06.959
Thank you, Ravi.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.022
If you really

14:08.023 --> 14:09.042
want to thank me,

14:09.083 --> 14:10.355
you should

14:10.356 --> 14:11.626
come to my

14:09.083 --> 14:11.626
next sitar recital.

14:11.667 --> 14:12.730
Aw! We'd

14:12.731 --> 14:13.792
love to but...

14:13.834 --> 14:15.356
(COUGHING)

14:15.357 --> 14:16.876
Flu-nesia!

14:16.918 --> 14:18.751
(BOTH COUGHING)

14:22.209 --> 14:23.834
Yes, officer, I realize

14:23.835 --> 14:25.459
she's only been missing

14:22.209 --> 14:25.459
for half an hour,

14:25.500 --> 14:27.168
but that's six

14:27.169 --> 14:28.834
whole brew cycles!

14:28.876 --> 14:30.418
Oh, did I not mention?

14:30.419 --> 14:31.959
She's a coffee maker?

14:32.876 --> 14:34.918
Hello? Hello?

14:37.209 --> 14:39.792
Serena, where are you?

14:39.834 --> 14:41.042
Oh, you!

14:41.083 --> 14:42.292
Hey! Where did

14:42.293 --> 14:43.500
you get that coffee?

14:46.125 --> 14:47.501
Soup? Oh, okay,

14:47.502 --> 14:48.876
you're in the clear.

14:48.918 --> 14:50.084
But I should keep

14:50.085 --> 14:51.250
this. I kind of

14:48.918 --> 14:51.250
backwashed a little.

14:52.167 --> 14:53.626
Serena?

14:56.918 --> 14:58.314
Hi, Jessie!

14:58.315 --> 14:59.709
Feeling tense,

14:56.918 --> 14:59.709
stressed?

14:59.751 --> 15:01.042
Need to relax?

15:01.083 --> 15:02.083
How about

15:02.084 --> 15:03.084
a massage?

15:03.125 --> 15:04.980
Oh, Emma, that's

15:04.981 --> 15:06.834
so sweet but...

15:06.876 --> 15:08.310
- I should really tell
- you, I only have...

15:08.334 --> 15:09.647
I got all your

15:09.648 --> 15:10.959
favorite oils!

15:11.000 --> 15:12.542
- That I only
- have 15 minutes.

15:13.500 --> 15:14.959
- I got a little
- knot right there.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.522
Oh! I know

15:16.523 --> 15:18.042
all about knots.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.293
Don't worry,

15:20.294 --> 15:21.584
you're in good hands.

15:22.542 --> 15:24.250
Is this a Swedish massage?

15:24.292 --> 15:25.522
No, more of

15:25.523 --> 15:26.751
a Tie massage.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.376
That's it, Red!

15:32.377 --> 15:33.751
The jig is up!

15:35.000 --> 15:36.500
Zuri? What jig?

15:36.501 --> 15:38.000
There's no jig!

15:38.042 --> 15:39.313
We know there's

15:39.314 --> 15:40.584
only one wristband.

15:40.626 --> 15:41.876
Ravi! I can't believe

15:41.877 --> 15:43.125
he told you guys!

15:43.167 --> 15:45.543
Believe it. I once

15:45.544 --> 15:47.918
told on myself

15:43.167 --> 15:47.918
for jaywalking.

15:47.959 --> 15:49.085
Okay, I promise

15:49.086 --> 15:50.209
I was going to

15:47.959 --> 15:50.209
tell you guys!

15:50.250 --> 15:51.647
When, on your way

15:51.648 --> 15:53.042
to the concert?

15:53.083 --> 15:55.000
No, when I got home!

15:55.042 --> 15:56.084
I thought a souvenir cup

15:56.085 --> 15:57.125
would soften the blow.

15:58.167 --> 15:59.292
Fork over

15:59.293 --> 16:00.417
the wristband.

16:00.459 --> 16:01.917
No, I am going to that

16:01.918 --> 16:03.375
concert and that is it.

16:03.417 --> 16:04.876
We'll see about that.

16:22.292 --> 16:23.876
- All right, fine,
- fine, fine! I give!

16:23.918 --> 16:24.980
The wristband

16:24.981 --> 16:26.042
is in my purse,

16:23.918 --> 16:26.042
behind the couch!

16:26.083 --> 16:28.042
- Please don't
- barbecue me!

16:28.083 --> 16:29.834
That sound effects app

16:29.835 --> 16:31.584
was the best 99 cents

16:28.083 --> 16:31.584
I ever spent.

16:32.876 --> 16:34.000
Got it!

16:34.042 --> 16:35.167
Well, I hope you

16:35.168 --> 16:36.292
girls are satisfied.

16:36.334 --> 16:37.918
- You both want to
- go to the concert,

16:37.959 --> 16:39.189
But you still only

16:39.190 --> 16:40.417
have one wristband.

16:40.459 --> 16:42.250
- I'd be laughing in
- your faces right now,

16:42.292 --> 16:44.209
- If you were still
- under my face hole.

16:45.626 --> 16:46.834
Oh...

16:46.876 --> 16:49.042
- I didn't think about
- who would get the wristband.

16:49.083 --> 16:50.542
Me neither.

16:50.584 --> 16:52.542
- I did!
- What?

16:54.959 --> 16:56.626
- Where do you
- think you're going?

17:16.481 --> 17:17.876
one more step

17:17.917 --> 17:19.666
and the wristband gets it!

you just trapped

No! She meant

nothing to me!
