00:19.144 --> 00:21.313
Roger, we see it, Jack.

00:21.355 --> 00:23.440
And, uh, we got a reading of, uh,

00:23.482 --> 00:27.486
minus two degrees in the docking index.

00:27.528 --> 00:32.616
We'd like to know if that's 2.0 precise
or if it's 2.1 or 1.9.

00:35.035 --> 00:37.913
No, it's minus 2.0 precisely.

00:37.955 --> 00:45.379
CAPCOM looks like the last item we need to hear
is a stir on the H2 and O2 at their convenience.

00:45.420 --> 00:46.630
Okay.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.722
13, we've got one more item for you,

00:54.763 --> 00:57.098
when you get a chance, we'd like you to
stir up your cryo tank.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.310
In addition, have a shaft in front of you...

01:00.352 --> 01:02.229
Okay.

01:02.270 --> 01:04.940
...for a look at the center if you need it.

01:04.982 --> 01:06.567
Okay, stand by.

01:13.741 --> 01:16.243
Hey, Houston, we've had a problem here.

01:16.284 --> 01:17.870
We've got more of a problem.

01:17.912 --> 01:20.080
Okay, listen. Listen, you guys.

01:20.121 --> 01:22.583
We've lost fuel cell one and two pressure.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.756
Uh, Houston, we've had a problem,

01:28.797 --> 01:30.758
Stand by.
They got a problem.

01:30.799 --> 01:32.676
Main B bus undervolt.

01:32.718 --> 01:34.553
Roger. Main B undervolt.

01:35.637 --> 01:37.556
Stand by, 13. We're looking at it.

01:53.822 --> 01:55.824
We had a pretty large bang

01:55.866 --> 01:59.119
associated with the caution and warning lamp.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.925
What was going through our mind is,

02:12.967 --> 02:14.969
"We're a long ways from home".

02:16.595 --> 02:18.472
We were hit with something we didn't expect,

02:18.513 --> 02:20.390
we were hit with something that we just,

02:20.432 --> 02:24.519
in our wildest imagination or
what if thinking, they never expected.

02:27.064 --> 02:30.150
That damn room  was in serious confusion.

02:32.903 --> 02:37.992
And it took me a while to come to
that conclusion, but it was true,

02:38.033 --> 02:40.953
and I'm not sure that Mission Control
knew what to do at that point.

02:42.454 --> 02:45.457
I says, "Chris, we're in deep shit".

02:45.499 --> 02:50.504
We were still trying to grasp
the total scope of this problem.

02:50.545 --> 02:52.131
One of our fuel cells had died,

02:52.171 --> 02:54.591
the second one was dying,

02:54.633 --> 02:56.969
and from a standpoint  of everything we had...

02:57.011 --> 02:58.762
You know, that's not a possibility.

02:58.804 --> 03:02.141
I mean, that's not a survival situation,
yet the crew's surviving.

03:04.351 --> 03:06.770
The key thing to me was time.

03:06.812 --> 03:08.563
We needed time to think.

03:09.815 --> 03:11.692
We needed to pull this team together

03:11.733 --> 03:13.735
doing something that had never been done before.

04:36.610 --> 04:39.196
And, Tim Peake, as you work your way

04:39.238 --> 04:41.322
around the mast caster there,

04:41.364 --> 04:42.616
feel free to look at the load path

04:42.657 --> 04:44.284
and get some situational awareness...

04:44.325 --> 04:46.369
When I'm trying to describe to somebody

04:46.411 --> 04:47.955
what I do for a living, I always have to ask,

04:47.996 --> 04:50.290
Have you ever seen the movie 'Apollo 13'?

04:50.331 --> 04:52.375
You know, that big room where all the people sit?

04:52.417 --> 04:54.795
That's, that's where I sit, that's what I do.

04:54.836 --> 04:56.671
When you describe your job,

04:56.713 --> 04:58.048
they ask, "What do you do at NASA?"

04:58.090 --> 04:59.507
And I said, "I'm a Flight Director",

04:59.549 --> 05:01.843
and they look at me kind of quizzically,

05:01.885 --> 05:02.925
and I say,

05:03.025 --> 05:05.472
"You know, the guy with the vest and the buzz cut?"

05:05.513 --> 05:08.475
I, uh, have had a chance to meet a few of those guys.

05:08.516 --> 05:11.812
I really admire everything that they stand for

05:11.853 --> 05:13.521
and what they were able to achieve.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.816
I think it's kind of amazing that, um,

05:15.857 --> 05:19.194
out of nothing they built this great institution.

05:19.236 --> 05:22.239
Okay understand that. It's the ventilation tube in the middle.

05:22.281 --> 05:23.615
We wouldn't be here today

05:23.657 --> 05:26.285
without the achievements that those folks made

05:26.326 --> 05:28.453
and the strides that they took

05:28.495 --> 05:31.581
in getting us down the path of human space flight.

05:31.623 --> 05:33.583
Yeah, we'll leave you there.

05:33.625 --> 05:35.043
Okay. Copy that.

05:35.085 --> 05:36.753
The people that have worked at NASA

05:36.795 --> 05:39.173
and particularly the folks in the Apollo era

05:39.214 --> 05:41.508
make it a point to come and speak to us

05:41.549 --> 05:44.303
to make sure that we truly understand the job

05:44.343 --> 05:46.305
that we are getting ready to undertake,

05:46.345 --> 05:48.723
and share their experiences with us.

05:50.225 --> 05:53.645
So all of us are very grateful to our founding fathers.

06:20.255 --> 06:24.509
I grew up in both Oklahoma and Texas,

06:24.551 --> 06:29.223
and I used to sit outside at night
and I'd gaze at the moon.

06:29.264 --> 06:31.933
Never occurred to me...

06:33.768 --> 06:36.188
that we would land people there.

06:37.856 --> 06:41.360
I still go out and I like to enjoy gazing at the moon,

06:41.400 --> 06:46.740
but I don't look at it the same way I did
when I was growing up.

06:46.781 --> 06:48.575
It's a different moon to me now.

06:53.288 --> 06:56.166
My childhood was directed by my father who was a drunk,

06:56.208 --> 07:00.254
and he was a womanizer, and he was a gambler.

07:02.547 --> 07:05.050
I left Philadelphia where we ended up living,

07:05.092 --> 07:07.802
and when I turned 18, I said, "I've had it".

07:07.844 --> 07:10.097
"I'm getting out  of this hellhole",
and I joined the Army.

07:11.681 --> 07:13.100
And they made me a weatherman.

07:13.141 --> 07:14.768
Of all things.

07:17.020 --> 07:19.231
When I was a senior in high school,

07:19.273 --> 07:21.608
I guess I took an aptitude test,

07:21.649 --> 07:26.905
and it said that I should either be
a funeral director or an engineer.

07:26.947 --> 07:31.576
And so I went to the library and checked out
a book titled "What Engineers Do",

07:31.618 --> 07:34.662
and it really intrigued me, and I said,

07:34.704 --> 07:37.707
That's what I want to be. "I wanna be an engineer".

07:40.627 --> 07:43.422
I was born in a little town in Pennsylvania,

07:43.463 --> 07:45.465
coal-mining town.

07:45.506 --> 07:48.093
My dad worked in the coal mines for a while.

07:50.304 --> 07:53.598
But growing up, I was really fascinated with airplanes,

07:53.640 --> 07:55.475
so I built a lot of model airplanes

07:55.516 --> 07:56.768
and I hung em from the ceilings.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.270
Little balsa things,

07:58.312 --> 08:00.772
learned how to put the paper around them and shrink it.

08:00.814 --> 08:03.358
Uh, and, you know, they got to look pretty good.

08:03.400 --> 08:08.113
Aviation plants need men to design
the planes of the future.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.740
I went to Virginia Tech during World War II.

08:12.075 --> 08:15.662
I was studying mechanical engineering,

08:15.703 --> 08:19.374
but I wanted to be a baseball player, not an engineer,

08:20.500 --> 08:22.294
but I knew I wasn't good enough.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.216
I thought I was gonna be this great baseball player,

08:28.258 --> 08:29.426
which I wasn't.

08:29.468 --> 08:31.345
You know, I was going nowhere.

08:31.386 --> 08:35.890
Somehow I ended off going to this junior college,

08:31.386 --> 08:35.890
studying merchandising.

08:35.932 --> 08:38.058
The two years I spent there,

08:38.101 --> 08:41.480
I really didn't learn a lot, even about merchandising.

08:41.520 --> 08:44.107
I learned how to smoke cigarettes, smoke cigars,

08:44.149 --> 08:48.153
drink whiskey and chase girls.
That's what I learned.

08:48.195 --> 08:49.988
And I did a good job of learning that.

08:51.823 --> 08:53.992
And then everything changed.

09:03.543 --> 09:06.713
There is something new in the heavens,

09:07.964 --> 09:11.134
something that has never been there before.

09:14.554 --> 09:18.058
It circles the Earth once every 96 minutes.

09:21.353 --> 09:23.230
It's called the Sputnik.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.442
I can remember Sputnik.

09:27.484 --> 09:30.237
It was in an English class,

09:30.278 --> 09:31.696
the speakers came on

09:31.738 --> 09:34.199
and the principal announced what had happened,

09:34.241 --> 09:38.786
and the Russians had put
a spacecraft or object into space.

09:40.705 --> 09:42.790
I remember I was driving along the road,

09:42.832 --> 09:44.209
and when I heard that on the news

09:44.251 --> 09:47.546
and I thought, "What? What is this?"

09:49.881 --> 09:51.799
And we said, "Holy-moly", you know,

09:51.841 --> 09:53.385
these guys are ahead of us.

09:53.427 --> 09:56.263
They've gotten a man-made satellite.

09:56.304 --> 10:00.934
And then shortly after that, uh, when Gagarin flew.

10:00.975 --> 10:03.895
It was the propaganda coup of the year.

10:03.937 --> 10:06.814
And obviously we all knew we were in a race.

10:06.856 --> 10:09.817
After the Russian flight, US plans were accelerated.

10:09.859 --> 10:14.155
Commander Alan B. Shepard was sent in a suborbital flight,

10:09.859 --> 10:14.155
unlike the Russian...

10:14.197 --> 10:17.033
And when Kennedy laid down the gauntlet

10:17.075 --> 10:20.287
that let's go to the moon and back and do it in a decade,

10:20.328 --> 10:22.497
I can remember, I wasn't even in the space program,

10:22.539 --> 10:25.708
but I remember thinking, "Can that be done?"

10:25.750 --> 10:28.711
No single space project in this period

10:28.753 --> 10:31.005
will be more impressive to mankind,

10:31.047 --> 10:34.926
or more important for the long range exploration of space,

10:34.968 --> 10:38.679
and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish.

10:38.721 --> 10:42.850
President Kennedy had charted our course.

10:42.892 --> 10:45.520
The landing of men on the moon...

10:46.938 --> 10:48.565
...before the end of the decade.

10:57.824 --> 11:02.412
We didn't know smuts about going to the moon,

11:02.454 --> 11:04.998
about the environment we were going into,

11:05.039 --> 11:09.961
or the mechanical aspects of
what was gonna be required of us.

11:11.963 --> 11:13.881
These things are pretty complicated.

11:15.216 --> 11:18.136
They maybe not seem complicated today,

11:18.178 --> 11:20.514
but they were complicated as hell back then.

11:28.522 --> 11:31.650
The background of flight control really was

11:31.690 --> 11:37.572
what we initially did in flight tests, testing airplanes.

11:39.449 --> 11:43.453
At Edwards Air Force Base, the NACA where I worked,

11:43.495 --> 11:47.541
were responsible for testing the X-1.

11:47.582 --> 11:52.379
And so, it was almost natural
to have somebody on the ground

11:52.420 --> 11:56.633
monitoring the X-1 systems,
making sure it was ready to fly

11:56.675 --> 12:01.804
from the bottom of the B-29.

12:11.730 --> 12:17.571
And they were able then to monitor
the performance of the vehicle,

12:18.821 --> 12:22.242
but also the performance of the test pilot.

12:27.788 --> 12:31.501
That was my concept of flight test

12:31.543 --> 12:34.170
and that became my concept of flight control.

12:37.048 --> 12:40.218
Okay, now what does that mean in space flight to us?

12:40.260 --> 12:43.930
How would we concoct that kind of a system

12:43.971 --> 12:47.517
that would allow us to get that kind of
information and talk to the crew?

12:47.559 --> 12:49.227
That was a very big job.

12:49.269 --> 12:52.063
We didn't have any buildings,
we didn't have any radar,

12:52.105 --> 12:53.772
we didn't have any telemetry,

12:53.814 --> 12:56.901
we didn't have any voice communication.

12:56.943 --> 13:00.447
And we ended up then saying, "These are our requirements".

13:00.488 --> 13:03.241
We gotta tell 'em it's got to have a computer.

13:04.242 --> 13:05.577
What the hell is a computer?

13:05.619 --> 13:08.787
It was almost that much we didn't know.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.333
It isn't something that we suddenly decided.

13:12.375 --> 13:15.462
We've got a control center, we've got these stations,

13:15.503 --> 13:17.171
and so we're gonna fly.

13:17.213 --> 13:18.423
That isn't how it happened.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.427
It developed with time.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.845
It sort of was an evolutionary thing.

13:27.348 --> 13:31.394
Chris is the creator of Mission Control.

13:31.436 --> 13:34.855
His was the very first voice that we heard,

13:34.897 --> 13:38.318
and he was the foundation for what Mission Control became

13:38.359 --> 13:42.447
and its relationship to the crews and the flights themselves.

13:42.489 --> 13:45.824
There was never any question who was in charge...

13:45.866 --> 13:48.827
because he had the persona, he had the demeanor,

13:48.869 --> 13:51.790
he had the quickness, he had the mental skills

13:51.830 --> 13:54.083
necessary to pull this team together.

13:55.543 --> 13:59.380
He had a way about him that he could kinda see

13:59.422 --> 14:02.175
what was happening, what was needed,

14:02.216 --> 14:06.012
and think through what we had to do to satisfy that need.

14:06.053 --> 14:09.432
...Two, one, fire.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.412
Oh, that view is tremendous.

14:38.961 --> 14:44.634
At the Cape, it was a kinda old steam engine

14:38.961 --> 14:44.634
kinda display.

14:44.676 --> 14:47.387
You had a bunch of little meters.

14:47.428 --> 14:50.056
For reading pressure and temperatures,

14:50.097 --> 14:52.475
and quantities of fuel and things like that.

14:56.979 --> 15:00.233
When we got the goal of going to the moon,

15:00.274 --> 15:03.444
that was a really much bigger step than Mercury.

15:05.572 --> 15:09.950
So the pathway to build the Control Center in Houston,

15:09.992 --> 15:14.163
equip it for the digital age, and make it work that way,

15:14.205 --> 15:16.666
was a big step for us from what we had done

15:16.708 --> 15:18.585
at the Control Center at the Cape.

15:21.588 --> 15:24.173
Fifteen hundred miles west of Cape Kennedy,

15:24.215 --> 15:26.300
the heart of the entire project,

15:26.342 --> 15:30.638
the Manned Spacecraft Center at Houston, Texas.

15:30.680 --> 15:34.308
And this building behind me where
all major decisions are made throughout the flight.

15:34.350 --> 15:35.518
Mission Control.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.606
From launch to splash down,

15:39.647 --> 15:43.610
in this room 17 key men whose average age is only 30

15:43.651 --> 15:46.571
will watch and control the Apollo Mission.

15:46.613 --> 15:49.073
They'll be aided in their task

15:49.115 --> 15:51.117
by a continuous flow of information

15:51.158 --> 15:54.328
pouring into this room 24 hours a day from space

15:54.370 --> 15:56.623
and from tracking stations all over the world.

15:56.664 --> 15:58.541
From these display panels behind me,

15:58.583 --> 16:00.418
they'll be able to call up anything

16:00.460 --> 16:04.088
from a live television picture of Cape Kennedy,

16:00.460 --> 16:04.088
or a recovery ship,

16:04.130 --> 16:06.466
to moon maps, like that one,

16:06.507 --> 16:10.261
to a circuit diagram of the smallest transistor

16:06.507 --> 16:10.261
on board the spacecraft.

16:10.303 --> 16:15.558
All the controllers in this room will be helped by six rooms

16:10.303 --> 16:15.558
full of back up staff.

16:17.560 --> 16:20.939
So, we need a lot of people.

16:20.980 --> 16:25.318
We were looking for people with certain kind of capabilities:

16:25.359 --> 16:28.780
math capabilities, systems capabilities,

16:28.822 --> 16:31.073
communications capabilities, on and on.

16:32.784 --> 16:35.161
I had become an air traffic controller.

16:36.203 --> 16:37.580
One day the phone rang

16:37.622 --> 16:40.500
and it was a gentleman out here in Houston

16:40.541 --> 16:42.168
and he started telling me they were hiring

16:42.209 --> 16:45.045
every engineer that walked in the door.

16:45.087 --> 16:46.464
And the next thing I knew,

16:46.506 --> 16:49.968
I was driving to Houston in my Austin Healey sports car

16:50.009 --> 16:53.012
with my black and white TV and my clothes.

16:53.053 --> 16:55.640
* Come and take a trip *

16:55.682 --> 16:57.308
* In my rocket ship *

16:57.350 --> 17:00.394
* We'll have a lovely afternoon *

17:00.436 --> 17:02.229
* Kiss the world goodbye *

17:02.271 --> 17:04.648
* And away we fly *

17:04.691 --> 17:06.901
* Destination moon *

17:06.943 --> 17:08.987
* Travel fast as light *

17:09.028 --> 17:10.780
* Till we're lost from sight *

17:10.821 --> 17:13.867
* The Earth is like a toy balloon *

17:13.907 --> 17:15.451
* Well, the thrill you get *

17:15.492 --> 17:18.371
* Riding on a jet... *

17:18.412 --> 17:21.875
I worked at McDonnell Aircraft doing electrical design,

17:21.915 --> 17:24.126
so I got set up with an appointment

17:24.167 --> 17:27.338
and filled out an application form

17:24.167 --> 17:27.338
to work for NASA.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.423
About three months later,

17:29.465 --> 17:32.635
I come home one day and there's a telegram

17:29.465 --> 17:32.635
under my door,

17:32.677 --> 17:34.220
job offer.

17:35.847 --> 17:37.097
See, I thought when I applied

17:37.139 --> 17:38.850
I would just get an interview maybe.

17:38.892 --> 17:41.019
Maybe, that's what I told my wife.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.980
But when the telegram came it was an offer,

17:44.022 --> 17:47.358
and it was an offer for more money than

17:44.022 --> 17:47.358
a country boy had ever seen,

17:47.400 --> 17:51.153
$6,770 a year.

17:53.573 --> 17:57.744
My first job was to give tours of Mission Control,

17:57.785 --> 18:02.040
and the Control Center was just being outfitted with consoles.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.833
As I was a tour guide,

18:03.875 --> 18:08.671
I had a chance to meet people that were going to

18:03.875 --> 18:08.671
man those consoles,

18:08.713 --> 18:11.340
and I say "man" because there were no women, they were all men.

18:11.382 --> 18:16.012
And they were going to run those
consoles and make the decisions,

18:16.054 --> 18:17.638
and they didn't have much time

18:17.680 --> 18:19.724
but they had a little bit to tell me
what they were gonna do,

18:19.766 --> 18:23.352
at least what the basic job was of each position.

18:23.394 --> 18:27.189
This front bank of consoles, known locally as the Trench,

18:27.231 --> 18:29.191
possibly because it's in the front line,

18:29.233 --> 18:31.193
is where the Rocket Men sit.

18:31.235 --> 18:34.697
It's their job to watch and check that every engine

18:31.235 --> 18:34.697
on board the space craft

18:34.739 --> 18:38.242
is firing correctly and pushing Apollo

18:34.739 --> 18:38.242
in the right direction.

18:38.284 --> 18:41.829
Right behind them here, the Flight Surgeon.

18:41.871 --> 18:44.999
His console has two normal screens like everybody else's,

18:45.041 --> 18:47.043
but here in the middle, on this screen

18:47.085 --> 18:49.503
he can monitor the physical state of the astronauts

18:49.545 --> 18:51.798
second by second throughout the flight.

18:51.839 --> 18:54.550
Next door to him sits the Capsule Communicator.

18:54.592 --> 18:56.052
An astronaut himself,

18:56.094 --> 18:58.972
he's trained with the crew and speaks astronaut jargon,

18:59.013 --> 19:01.265
and so acts as a kind of interpreter

19:01.307 --> 19:05.728
when a particularly difficult order has to be
passed from Flight Control to the crew.

19:05.770 --> 19:08.064
Next to him, along this bank of consoles,

19:08.106 --> 19:11.484
the men who check all the systems

19:08.106 --> 19:11.484
on the space craft.

19:11.525 --> 19:15.529
And behind them all, the boss, the Flight Director himself.

19:15.571 --> 19:17.657
He co-ordinates everybody's effort

19:17.698 --> 19:21.119
and uses that to assume responsibility
for minute-to-minute decisions

19:21.160 --> 19:23.245
on the state of the mission throughout the flight.

19:43.850 --> 19:46.978
And hey, we got a new program called Gemini.

19:51.024 --> 19:53.151
Why have we got Gemini?

19:53.192 --> 19:56.154
Well, with all these things we gotta do to
go to the moo and beginning to figure it,

19:56.195 --> 19:58.156
we gotta do some testing.

19:59.866 --> 20:03.410
We gotta do some stuff that proves we can do this stuff.

20:03.452 --> 20:07.957
Five, four, three, two,

20:07.999 --> 20:09.667
one, fire.

20:26.017 --> 20:29.687
And there was a side benefit

20:29.729 --> 20:32.356
that was very important too

20:32.398 --> 20:35.526
in that the ground had to learn how to operate.

20:35.568 --> 20:41.741
Gemini became the proving ground for this
Chris Kraft approach to Mission Control.

20:50.249 --> 20:55.337
So for the team in the Control Center,
Gemini became the big step up.

21:08.809 --> 21:12.813
Each one of the missions had a very defined set of objectives.

21:12.855 --> 21:15.524
First of all, you can survive in space.

21:15.566 --> 21:17.860
Second, you can stay there for a long time.

21:19.070 --> 21:21.822
And then, the rendezvous in the EVA.

21:23.741 --> 21:25.826
Space walks and all this kind of stuff.

21:31.916 --> 21:34.376
By the time we came out of Gemini,

21:34.418 --> 21:39.966
we had a very well tested group of people.

21:40.007 --> 21:43.136
And when we got to Apollo,
we just had to blow it up.

21:43.177 --> 21:47.306
You know, make it...it just had to be bigger.

21:47.347 --> 21:53.771
So, we were ready to take on the rigors and
the difficulties that Apollo presented to us.

22:15.960 --> 22:18.504
The moon is a necessary first step

22:18.545 --> 22:20.464
for exploration of the planets.

22:20.506 --> 22:23.759
To fly men there and return them safely in this decade

22:23.801 --> 22:26.595
is the goal of NASA's project Apollo.

22:26.637 --> 22:28.472
The early missions of Mercury,

22:28.514 --> 22:30.516
and the experience from Gemini,

22:30.557 --> 22:33.769
have brought this country to the next major milestone:

22:33.811 --> 22:36.647
the first Apollo three-man space flight.

22:36.689 --> 22:39.066
These are the men to fly that mission:

22:39.108 --> 22:41.401
Command Pilot Virgil Grissom.

22:41.443 --> 22:44.071
I knew Gus Grissom extremely well.

22:46.364 --> 22:49.076
I knew Ed White pretty well.

22:49.118 --> 22:51.954
I didn't know Roger Chaffee very well at all.

22:53.413 --> 22:55.082
I knew their families,

22:57.084 --> 22:59.879
I knew their capabilities,

22:59.920 --> 23:04.008
I know their...what drove astronauts.

23:04.050 --> 23:06.927
The Saturn rocket, the Apollo spacecraft,

23:06.969 --> 23:10.848
and all the component parts have been tested and retested.

23:10.890 --> 23:13.517
Everything is nearly ready, including the crew,

23:13.559 --> 23:17.021
for this country's first three-man space flight.

23:25.403 --> 23:29.449
On Apollo 1, we were trying to get the first manned flight off,

23:29.491 --> 23:32.494
and it was a push, it was obviously...

23:32.536 --> 23:36.374
That usually happens at the beginning of a program,

23:36.414 --> 23:38.667
and we were having trouble with the space craft.

23:38.709 --> 23:41.587
We knew that there was bad workmanship.

23:41.628 --> 23:45.632
We knew that the wires were exposed.

23:45.674 --> 23:47.718
My introduction to the Apollo program

23:47.760 --> 23:49.511
after I came off of Gemini

23:49.553 --> 23:53.557
was that they were conducting a live pad test

23:53.599 --> 23:56.936
with the crew in a flight condition

23:56.977 --> 24:00.689
on the pad at the launch site in Kennedy.

24:03.483 --> 24:06.695
Most of that activity was directed by the Cape.

24:06.737 --> 24:10.032
I mean, they were in charge of it. We were just monitoring.

24:10.074 --> 24:11.867
But the Cape was really responsible for it,

24:11.909 --> 24:15.788
so I don't know if they felt any pressure
to get that test done or not.

24:18.416 --> 24:22.211
The way the hatch was designed, it sealed from the inside.

24:23.461 --> 24:25.756
They were buttoned up in a space craft

24:25.798 --> 24:29.676
at 16 pounds per square inch of pure oxygen.

24:29.718 --> 24:35.099
I don't think any of us recognized
the seriousness of the danger

24:35.141 --> 24:36.809
we had put the crew in.

24:36.850 --> 24:39.519
If you got anything that'll burn,
and if it ever catches fire,

24:39.561 --> 24:41.439
it's just gonna be a holocaust.

24:44.442 --> 24:48.988
So I was sitting there watching all the data coming in,

24:49.029 --> 24:53.075
listening to the dialogue, absorbing this stuff, learning.

24:53.117 --> 24:55.577
I was back in my office doing paperwork,

24:55.619 --> 24:59.081
but came back to be the flight director,

24:59.123 --> 25:02.876
and Gus says, "I'm ready to go",

25:02.918 --> 25:05.296
finally after bitching like hell about the fact

25:05.338 --> 25:08.590
that he couldn't hear somebody or
he couldn't talk to somebody.

25:14.596 --> 25:16.349
And so, we were taking a break.

25:16.390 --> 25:19.685
They were going to see if they could fix the comm.

25:19.726 --> 25:23.897
And some of the guys stood up and went outside the room,

25:23.939 --> 25:25.732
but for some reason, I hung back for a second.

25:25.774 --> 25:28.235
I had something to do, and I still had my headset on.

25:28.277 --> 25:29.527
And all at once,

25:30.696 --> 25:33.449
you know, I heard it..."Fire".

25:37.577 --> 25:40.622
And then there was some silence,
and then there was a bunch of noise.

25:40.664 --> 25:42.582
Just noise. I couldn't tell what it was.

25:42.624 --> 25:45.211
Wow, it all happened just right quick.

25:45.252 --> 25:47.796
We were sitting there and we hear the crew.

25:47.838 --> 25:49.756
We heard the shouts from the crew.

25:49.798 --> 25:51.342
Egress, egress".

25:51.384 --> 25:53.969
I said, "Hey, get back on here. There's something going on".

25:56.013 --> 25:58.432
And then, from then on, it was...

25:59.933 --> 26:02.061
impossible to do anything about it.

26:03.062 --> 26:04.730
Uh, of course...

26:05.939 --> 26:08.608
you're just in shock.

26:36.303 --> 26:38.055
Because I'd been in the flight test business

26:38.097 --> 26:39.639
for quite a while of my life,

26:39.681 --> 26:42.435
I've seen death happen in various ways,

26:39.681 --> 26:42.435
but not like that.

26:45.229 --> 26:47.647
And so you had that feeling of guilt,

26:48.941 --> 26:50.984
you had that feeling of remorse,

26:51.026 --> 26:55.739
you had that feeling of,
"My God, why did we ever let that happen?"

27:00.660 --> 27:05.832
I think that, uh, we killed those three men.

27:00.660 --> 27:05.832
It's almost murder.

27:17.886 --> 27:21.098
A short period of time after this all happened,

27:21.140 --> 27:26.312
we were called to an all-hands meeting in the auditorium,

27:26.353 --> 27:28.481
and we were called in there by Gene Kranz.

27:30.566 --> 27:33.026
Here we had a group of very young engineers,

27:33.068 --> 27:34.736
most of them just fresh out of college,

27:34.778 --> 27:37.615
who had never gone through this type of an experience.

27:39.116 --> 27:40.826
The first thing that you do

27:40.867 --> 27:45.331
is to identify what your part in this failure was all about.

27:45.372 --> 27:47.749
And Gene commenced to tell us

27:49.084 --> 27:52.712
that we were all responsible for killing the crew,

27:55.048 --> 27:58.135
that we had not done our jobs.

27:58.177 --> 28:00.429
We could have gone to the program manager and said,

28:00.471 --> 28:02.306
"Look, we're not ready", but we didn't.

28:02.348 --> 28:05.725
So therefore, we will never do this again.

28:05.767 --> 28:09.687
Our teams in Mission Control will be known by two words.

28:09.729 --> 28:14.067
He said to us, I want you to go back to your offices,

28:14.109 --> 28:17.363
and on your blackboard, white boards that we had,

28:17.404 --> 28:20.366
I want you to write 'tough and competent' on that board,

28:21.825 --> 28:24.911
and I don't want you to ever remove it.

28:24.953 --> 28:27.289
Tough: we were never going to shirk our responsibilities

28:27.331 --> 28:30.167
because we're forever accountable for what we do,

28:30.209 --> 28:32.252
or in the case of Apollo 1, what did we fail to do.

28:32.294 --> 28:35.339
Competent: we're never going to take anything for granted.

28:35.381 --> 28:36.590
We'll never stop learning.

28:36.632 --> 28:39.426
From now on, as a team, we will be perfect.

28:40.886 --> 28:44.682
I think it changed the entire attitude

28:44.723 --> 28:48.143
of who we were, what we did,

28:48.185 --> 28:52.272
and how we progressed into the future of space flight.

29:13.544 --> 29:16.338
It's my opinion and an opinion of many others,

29:16.380 --> 29:19.299
had that not happened,

29:19.341 --> 29:22.094
we would never have gotten to the moon.

29:24.137 --> 29:28.058
That interim period following the fire

29:28.100 --> 29:30.977
was the only thing that saved our ass,

29:31.019 --> 29:37.150
because we were able to then step back and say,

29:31.019 --> 29:37.150
What's wrong with this thing?

29:37.192 --> 29:41.363
What do we have to do to fix it?

29:41.405 --> 29:47.620
And it brought together the whole
organization from top to bottom in NASA.

29:49.829 --> 29:52.708
Without all that happening, we'd have never gotten there.

30:00.132 --> 30:03.636
We had leaders, actually, all the way from the top

30:03.677 --> 30:07.681
that told us, you know, "Get the job done",

30:07.723 --> 30:11.101
and they didn't try to do it for us.

30:14.229 --> 30:18.858
We worked for people that were great leaders.

30:18.900 --> 30:24.197
It started out with the Krafts and
the Gilruths and those guys,

30:24.239 --> 30:25.907
and they mentored their people,

30:25.949 --> 30:29.453
and you learned to mentor your people

30:25.949 --> 30:29.453
as you became a manager.

30:32.456 --> 30:34.458
To be a leader,

30:34.500 --> 30:40.213
you have to be willing to accept the responsibility

30:34.500 --> 30:40.213
that requires you to do that,

30:40.255 --> 30:45.385
and that's what people don't understand about management.

30:48.180 --> 30:51.433
They don't understand that it takes a commitment...

30:52.434 --> 30:54.436
that you're willing to accept.

30:57.690 --> 31:01.443
I became notorious for saying what the hell I thought.

31:02.695 --> 31:04.822
I want to hear what you have to say,

31:04.863 --> 31:08.408
and I might give you hell if I don't like it,

31:08.450 --> 31:09.951
but that's tough.

31:09.993 --> 31:14.581
Go away and come up with another idea

31:09.993 --> 31:14.581
that I might like.

31:14.623 --> 31:17.668
And I expressed those kind of thoughts to people.

31:17.710 --> 31:22.214
That's where I got my management forte.

31:22.255 --> 31:23.716
People liked it.

32:02.087 --> 32:06.007
Apollo 8 was going to be an Earth orbital flight.

32:06.049 --> 32:10.929
Uh, we were going to fly
the Lunar Module for the first time.

32:12.931 --> 32:17.770
And we'd go and do various maneuvers in Earth orbit.

32:19.855 --> 32:23.817
Well, they delivered the Lunar Module to the Cape

32:23.859 --> 32:26.653
and it was a horrible piece of hardware.

32:26.695 --> 32:29.948
They couldn't get the damn thing checked out.

32:29.989 --> 32:32.284
And as a result, it was way behind schedule

32:32.325 --> 32:36.413
and it was not gonna meet the schedule now of
the Command and Service Module

32:36.455 --> 32:38.624
which was coming along very well.

32:44.379 --> 32:47.299
NASA management came up with this idea of,

32:47.340 --> 32:51.470
okay, let's take the flight opportunity that we have,

32:51.511 --> 32:56.892
let's assume we can get the fixes into the Saturn V,

32:56.934 --> 33:01.688
and let us think about going around the moon.

33:05.108 --> 33:08.236
I said, "My God, that's a hell of a different proposition".

33:08.278 --> 33:11.949
The risk involved there are many manifold.

33:13.742 --> 33:16.286
And the first thing I did was call my people

33:16.328 --> 33:20.373
who I thought were necessary to deciding
whether we could do it or not.

33:22.542 --> 33:25.545
So we all got together, there was about eight or ten of us,

33:25.587 --> 33:28.966
talked it over, and I told 'em what we were thinking about.

33:29.007 --> 33:32.177
I thought, really, he's got to be crazy.

33:32.218 --> 33:35.889
You know, we're a long way from being ready to do that.

33:38.350 --> 33:41.186
And I said, I want you to go away and I...

33:41.227 --> 33:43.355
Here's what I see the problems are.

33:43.396 --> 33:45.315
Now, you go ahead and think about this

33:45.357 --> 33:46.859
and you tell me what the problems are,

33:46.900 --> 33:48.610
and whether you think you can do it.

33:51.655 --> 33:54.407
So that was an intense weekend,

33:54.449 --> 33:59.872
and we went back on Monday, and says,
"Yes, we can do it, with these limitations".

34:16.094 --> 34:18.139
So we walked off from Apollo 7

34:18.181 --> 34:19.558
after we got that all wrapped up,

34:19.599 --> 34:22.268
and bang, they made that announcement.

34:19.599 --> 34:22.268
It was like,

34:22.310 --> 34:24.521
"You're gonna do what?"

34:26.565 --> 34:29.150
We're gonna send a spacecraft out on a trajectory

34:29.192 --> 34:32.320
that's only gonna miss the moon by 60 miles?

34:35.574 --> 34:37.199
It was incredible.

34:39.578 --> 34:41.580
So, if all goes well,

34:41.621 --> 34:44.165
at ten minutes to 2:00 on Saturday afternoon,

34:44.206 --> 34:46.292
that's ten minutes to 8:00 in the morning here,

34:46.333 --> 34:49.838
Borman, Lovell, and Anders will be sitting up there,
one minute from launch,

34:49.880 --> 34:54.217
on a mission that has more risks in it
than the Americans have ever tolerated before,

34:54.259 --> 34:56.762
and on a rocket that has only flown twice.

35:34.674 --> 35:36.676
Apollo 8, you're looking good.

35:36.718 --> 35:40.388
We're looking good.

35:53.026 --> 35:56.029
Apollo 8, Houston. You're a go for staging, over.

35:56.071 --> 35:57.322
Roger that.

36:05.038 --> 36:09.001
There was a real sense of the magnitude

36:09.042 --> 36:10.752
of what we were doing within the Control Center.

36:10.794 --> 36:15.966
We quadruple checked every number that we

36:10.794 --> 36:15.966
sent up to the crew.

36:16.008 --> 36:19.218
You know, nobody said anything to each other,

36:16.008 --> 36:19.218
but you could just tell,

36:19.260 --> 36:21.429
you know, by looking around

36:21.471 --> 36:25.183
that yes, he's having the same thoughts that I am.

36:25.224 --> 36:28.728
This is no simulation, this is for real.

36:39.990 --> 36:42.575
Trans Lunar Injection, TLI,

36:42.617 --> 36:44.870
when they did those things, you knew you were on your way.

36:44.911 --> 36:47.622
I mean, there was no time to come back

36:47.664 --> 36:49.875
except to go around the moon and come back, you know.

36:52.961 --> 36:55.964
Now he's counting for two...

36:56.006 --> 36:57.174
...one.

36:59.968 --> 37:03.138
It put us on a course to the moon,

37:03.180 --> 37:06.599
25,000 miles an hour, all the way,

37:06.641 --> 37:09.144
and we could actually, if we wanted to,

37:09.186 --> 37:11.813
coast all the way to the moon.

37:13.732 --> 37:16.068
Trajectory, guidance, flight dynamics,

37:16.109 --> 37:19.529
everybody in the front, what's called the
Front Trench of this control center,

37:19.571 --> 37:22.074
says they're happy, and that includes the booster.

37:50.143 --> 37:51.895
During the Apollo 8 Mission,

37:51.937 --> 37:55.941
I was not directly involved,

37:55.982 --> 37:58.276
so I had the luxury, and it was a luxury,

37:58.317 --> 38:00.820
of feeling the emotions that

38:00.862 --> 38:04.282
I'm sure the people in the viewing room
were starting to feel...

38:06.618 --> 38:10.872
the emotions that the people out in the world were watching.

38:10.914 --> 38:15.501
I mean, they were watching this crew
go to the moon and basically describing it.

38:27.264 --> 38:30.600
And instead of having to stay focused on the next event,

38:30.642 --> 38:32.769
the next thing, when is the next call we got,

38:32.811 --> 38:35.272
I could say, "God, this is beautiful".

38:35.313 --> 38:41.653
I mean, I cannot think of any place
I'd rather be in my entire lifetime

38:41.694 --> 38:43.738
than to be here in Mission Control.

38:50.411 --> 38:52.538
Uh, this is Apollo Control Houston

38:52.580 --> 38:56.084
at 68 hours, 52 minutes into the flight of Apollo 8.

38:56.126 --> 38:59.171
At this time, Glynn Lunney has gone around the room

38:59.212 --> 39:02.548
taking a status check with his flight control team.

39:02.590 --> 39:05.677
We look go, we continue to stand by,

39:05.718 --> 39:08.429
and this is Apollo Control Houston.

39:08.471 --> 39:10.348
Here we go.

39:10.389 --> 39:12.809
I was on duty for the Lunar Orbit Insertion,

39:12.851 --> 39:15.728
and we start falling towards the moon,

39:15.770 --> 39:18.690
and, uh, it's getting bigger.

39:18.731 --> 39:20.358
There's a two hour orbit around the moon,

39:20.399 --> 39:22.110
and when you go behind the moon,

39:22.152 --> 39:26.865
you have about maybe 50 minutes of

39:22.152 --> 39:26.865
where you can't see the vehicle.

39:26.906 --> 39:29.617
Well, that was a very eerie feeling.

39:29.659 --> 39:32.329
You know, we had...here we're going to the moon,

39:32.370 --> 39:37.334
been talking back and forth with
the flight crew all of the way.

39:37.375 --> 39:38.918
And then we have loss of signal,

39:38.960 --> 39:41.587
you know, LOS, and we can't talk to them.

39:57.854 --> 40:03.109
Mission Control said,
You're gonna lose communication with us at such and such a time,

40:03.151 --> 40:06.238
and to the second, that's where we lost communication.

40:21.627 --> 40:27.008
You could've heard a pin drop in that Control Center.

40:27.050 --> 40:30.887
I mean, this was the first time we gone behind the moon.

40:30.929 --> 40:33.973
You can't see it and we can't...you don't have any data,

40:34.015 --> 40:37.476
so we're depending on the space craft
working perfectly behind the moon,

40:37.518 --> 40:41.064
because it can come out from the
backside of that moon, it can go anywhere.

40:41.106 --> 40:43.900
It might be headed into the damn lunar surface.

40:43.942 --> 40:45.777
It might be headed into deep space

40:45.818 --> 40:48.280
if that engine screwed up or the computer screwed up.

40:50.240 --> 40:51.950
So I'm up pretty tight.

41:01.667 --> 41:03.836
They had to do a maneuver on the backside

41:03.878 --> 41:07.006
to slow down to stay in orbit around the moon,

41:07.048 --> 41:08.758
and if they didn't do that maneuver,

41:08.800 --> 41:13.221
they would come out back into
view of the Earth at one time.

41:13.263 --> 41:16.849
If they did do the maneuver,
then they would come back in another time.

41:16.891 --> 41:19.727
And we had two countdown clocks setup

41:19.769 --> 41:22.063
so that we could countdown to both of those.

41:32.282 --> 41:34.117
Apollo Control Houston,

41:34.159 --> 41:37.078
mark one minute from predicted time of acquisition.

41:45.378 --> 41:47.297
Apollo Control Houston,

41:47.339 --> 41:51.217
Jerry Carr has placed a call, we're standing by.

41:51.259 --> 41:54.012
We've heard nothing yet but we're standing by.

42:17.702 --> 42:19.537
We've got it. We've got it.

42:19.578 --> 42:24.042
Apollo 8 now in lunar orbit.

42:29.881 --> 42:32.050
Sure enough, they came around the corner.

42:32.091 --> 42:35.094
The burn had gone fine, they were in orbit.

42:35.136 --> 42:37.389
So, there's a cheer in this room.

42:37.430 --> 42:39.265
Uh, this is Apollo Control, Houston

42:39.307 --> 42:41.559
switching now to the voice of Jim Lovell.

42:57.658 --> 42:59.369
Big sigh of relief

42:59.411 --> 43:02.080
'cause we knew at least they were stable.

43:02.121 --> 43:05.124
Now, whether we could get 'em out of orbit that was,

43:02.121 --> 43:05.124
that was another question.

43:07.419 --> 43:08.753
I would say that all of us,

43:08.794 --> 43:10.838
we probably spent the whole day

43:10.880 --> 43:13.299
that we were in orbit around the moon, in the Control Center.

43:14.217 --> 43:15.718
Everybody was so keyed up.

43:17.512 --> 43:21.558
Then, you know, towards the end of this day,

43:21.599 --> 43:25.937
Frank Borman comes on, says, you know,

43:21.599 --> 43:25.937
they have something to say.

43:41.578 --> 43:44.747
So I was just watching what was going on with the space craft,

43:44.789 --> 43:46.416
everything was nominal.

43:48.334 --> 43:51.670
And then Frank Borman...

43:51.712 --> 43:54.799
just started, said, in the beginning...

43:57.218 --> 43:59.137
"God created heaven and Earth".

44:12.024 --> 44:15.069
It hit me like a ton of bricks,

44:15.111 --> 44:17.947
and then it hit everybody in that Mission Control Center,

44:15.111 --> 44:17.947
I think,

44:17.989 --> 44:21.951
whether they were faith based or not, like a ton of bricks.

44:21.993 --> 44:24.870
It made the hair stand up on my neck.

44:55.943 --> 44:59.572
It was, uh, such a moment.

45:00.865 --> 45:03.576
None of us knew that was gonna happen,

45:03.618 --> 45:08.122
and, uh, you know, I'm not ashamed to admit I was crying.

45:15.087 --> 45:18.715
It just rang the right bell for everybody,

45:18.757 --> 45:20.759
and if you thought about it for 40 years

45:20.801 --> 45:24.639
and asked yourself,
"What could you have said that was better than that?"

45:24.681 --> 45:26.932
there wouldn't have been another answer.

45:26.974 --> 45:29.018
And God saw that it was good.

45:29.060 --> 45:32.438
We engineers are not poets.

45:32.480 --> 45:35.024
We're not good at that but, uh,

45:35.066 --> 45:39.195
I mean, it was a profound effect

45:35.066 --> 45:39.195
on everybody that was in the Control Center.

46:13.688 --> 46:17.567
A screenwriter couldn't have done a better job.

46:17.609 --> 46:22.905
The year of 1968, in the US, a very disastrous year,

46:22.947 --> 46:27.034
with the Vietnam War going on, and the elections going,

46:27.076 --> 46:30.496
and the riots going, and the killing of two prominent people.

46:33.499 --> 46:39.796
To end the year by going around the moon on Christmas Eve,

46:40.797 --> 46:44.135
it all just fell into place.

46:50.182 --> 46:52.477
Spider Gumdrop, I can see your jets firing

46:52.518 --> 46:54.145
just as clear as a bell.

47:20.546 --> 47:24.509
We used to work just crazy hours.

47:24.550 --> 47:29.846
We would run 10 or 12 launch sims a day.

47:29.888 --> 47:31.557
And it was grinding.

47:31.599 --> 47:33.643
We were so consumed with these flights

47:33.685 --> 47:36.354
and exercising them and so on and so on

47:36.395 --> 47:41.317
that we never really had sufficient time to savor them.

47:41.359 --> 47:43.820
It took a toll on the family, you know.

47:43.860 --> 47:45.488
We weren't around that much.

47:45.530 --> 47:48.366
The wives took over. They did all that.

47:48.407 --> 47:50.785
And, uh, they managed the checkbooks,

47:50.827 --> 47:52.537
they did everything.

47:52.578 --> 47:55.373
If I could go back and do all over with again,

47:55.414 --> 47:57.082
I wouldn't do it.

47:58.793 --> 48:01.212
It was that much of an impact on my family.

48:02.963 --> 48:05.675
NASA consumed my time.

48:17.978 --> 48:20.272
The simulation team had a little room

48:20.314 --> 48:21.733
right off the front of the Control Center

48:21.774 --> 48:24.736
with a glass window, they could see us.

48:24.777 --> 48:29.448
And when we ran a simulation,
which was a training exercise,

48:29.490 --> 48:32.159
it included the Control Center,

48:32.201 --> 48:37.039
it included the crew, the actual crew usually, over the simulator,

48:37.081 --> 48:41.293
and we were all interconnected both data and voice-wise.

48:45.130 --> 48:49.343
So it was really a way to check out all the ground systems

48:49.385 --> 48:52.597
and, uh, develop procedures,

48:52.638 --> 48:55.516
'cause if the didn't work in the simulator,
they weren't gonna work for real.

49:03.691 --> 49:05.777
My nickname for the sim guys

49:05.818 --> 49:09.071
those who are out to get us.

49:09.113 --> 49:12.199
They just kept throwing problems at you all the time.

49:12.241 --> 49:15.286
And they were trying to push us to our limits
and see where we were gonna go.

49:17.789 --> 49:22.376
We were about half way through the landing simulation...

49:24.211 --> 49:26.631
and we get this program alarm in the computer.

49:27.799 --> 49:29.759
1201, 1202, you know, uh,

49:29.801 --> 49:32.969
and everybody's wondering, "What the hell is a 1201, 1202?"

49:34.889 --> 49:38.768
Program alarms was the computer's way of telling us,

49:38.810 --> 49:40.561
"You're asking me to do too much".

49:40.603 --> 49:43.272
I mean, we were very unfamiliar with that, at least to me.

49:44.565 --> 49:46.358
I call my back room,

49:46.400 --> 49:52.907
Jack Garman was an expert at computer programs,
and he didn't know.

49:52.949 --> 49:59.037
So I said,
"Flight, something is happening. I don't know what. Abort".

50:00.748 --> 50:02.708
In Mission Control, when we wrote the Mission Rules,

50:02.750 --> 50:05.670
you need two cues to call an abort.

50:05.711 --> 50:08.255
And that was when we started the debriefing,

50:08.297 --> 50:10.549
the simulation supervisor came in and said,

50:10.591 --> 50:12.844
"Well, you had one cue, what was your second one?"

50:14.303 --> 50:17.431
And there was total dead silence in that room.

50:17.473 --> 50:20.434
After the debriefing was over,

50:20.476 --> 50:24.104
Gene said, I want you to get that team together

50:24.146 --> 50:28.526
and you tell me which alarms you're going to
continue on and which ones you're not.

50:28.567 --> 50:30.945
So I said, Jack, you pull together MIT,

50:30.987 --> 50:34.114
the people that built this computer,
and anyone else you can,

50:34.156 --> 50:37.284
come up with the list, brief me on it,

50:37.326 --> 50:38.995
and that's what we'll write as a rule.

50:39.035 --> 50:40.663
And that's exactly what Jack did.

50:45.960 --> 50:51.089
Cape Kennedy's dreaming towers,
launching pads for lofty ideals.

50:59.264 --> 51:01.392
Collins, Armstrong and Aldrin,

51:01.433 --> 51:04.436
the three men chosen for mankind's most historic mission,

51:04.478 --> 51:07.940
to reach a new world and return with a handful of dust.

51:07.982 --> 51:10.568
The scientists were not very happy

51:10.609 --> 51:13.529
that we hadn't done everything they wanted to do,

51:13.571 --> 51:15.907
and I had said to them,

51:15.948 --> 51:20.703
Look, I'm not gonna listen to anymore
of the things you want to do.

51:20.745 --> 51:22.872
I said, "We are going to the moon".

51:22.914 --> 51:24.415
We're going to land on the moon,

51:24.456 --> 51:26.959
we're gonna get our ass off of the moon as fast as we can,

51:27.001 --> 51:29.461
and still picked up some samples,

51:29.503 --> 51:32.464
and make sure the space craft's ready to go,
and we're coming back

51:32.506 --> 51:34.592
because we want to prove to ourselves

51:34.633 --> 51:37.762
that all the things that we thought about

51:34.633 --> 51:39.889
to fly there and back are correct and done well.

51:51.275 --> 51:54.695
It was time for Apollo 11.

51:54.737 --> 51:58.741
There was a lot of emotions in the Control Center.

51:58.783 --> 52:00.659
The team was comfortable.

52:00.701 --> 52:05.330
The team was satisfied that we had done everything

52:00.701 --> 52:05.330
we knew how to do,

52:05.372 --> 52:09.085
to be sure that this was as safe as we could make it.

52:10.962 --> 52:13.129
We had a security guard.

52:13.171 --> 52:15.883
This guy here is exuberance,

52:15.925 --> 52:19.344
and he comes up and says,
So we're gonna land today, Mr.Kranz,

52:19.386 --> 52:21.722
and all of a sudden, that was different.

52:21.764 --> 52:24.475
The room was already starting to fill up,

52:24.516 --> 52:29.521
not just in Mission Control,
the controllers on that shift were coming on duty,

52:29.563 --> 52:32.608
but also, there was a visitors viewing room

52:32.650 --> 52:37.237
and it was filling up with every NASA manager

52:37.279 --> 52:40.032
that had ever had anything to do with Apollo.

52:42.534 --> 52:46.747
I was anxious, you know. It's a big deal.

52:46.789 --> 52:50.626
So I was really focused on it and
was really excited, actually.

52:50.668 --> 52:54.005
This meant today's the day, you know, we're gonna do this.

53:33.627 --> 53:35.211
Everything was on track.

53:35.253 --> 53:38.174
We're ahead of the Flight Plan right on down the line.

53:39.257 --> 53:42.553
We had a private conference loop

53:42.594 --> 53:45.848
that was accessible only to the people in the control room.

53:45.890 --> 53:49.476
The outside world couldn't hear it,
the managers couldn't hear it.

53:50.519 --> 53:51.979
He just talked to us.

53:53.189 --> 53:54.815
And basically I indicate

53:54.857 --> 53:57.776
that I believe we were born for this day,

53:57.818 --> 53:59.403
we were meant to be here.

54:01.530 --> 54:05.534
We did a great job preparing for this mission.

54:05.576 --> 54:10.706
And then I said,
"I will stand behind every decision you will make".

54:10.748 --> 54:14.459
We came into this room as a team and we will leave as a team.

54:18.839 --> 54:24.511
I can remember that today as well as if it was a second ago.

54:24.553 --> 54:28.390
I can remember the words, I can remember what he said,

54:28.432 --> 54:30.935
and that made all the difference in the world.

54:37.315 --> 54:41.277
And then I said, uh, GC, go to battle short,

54:41.319 --> 54:44.364
and he went up and locked the control room doors,

54:44.406 --> 54:50.412
and these doors would not be reopened until
we had either landed, crashed, or abort.

54:53.707 --> 54:55.500
This is Apollo Control

54:55.542 --> 55:00.005
at 102 hours, 12 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11.

55:00.047 --> 55:04.635
We're now two minutes 53 seconds from reacquiring the spacecraft.

55:04.676 --> 55:06.511
Twenty-one minutes, 23 seconds

55:06.553 --> 55:10.057
from the beginning of the powered descent to the lunar surface.

55:13.435 --> 55:15.187
Fine control with the burn attitude.

55:15.229 --> 55:16.272
Rog.

55:23.445 --> 55:27.532
Here's the moon and here's the orbit you're in.

55:27.574 --> 55:31.578
And here you do PDI, Powered Descent Initiation.

55:33.122 --> 55:36.875
And Kranz goes to every position,
"Are you go or no-go?"

55:36.917 --> 55:39.419
You got to be "go" or we ain't gonna start that burn.

55:39.461 --> 55:41.130
Okay, Retro?
Go.

55:41.172 --> 55:42.089
Fido?
Go.

55:42.131 --> 55:43.048
Guide?
Go!

55:43.090 --> 55:43.966
Control?
Go.

55:44.008 --> 55:44.842
Telcom?
Go.

55:44.883 --> 55:45.717
GNC?
Go.

55:45.759 --> 55:47.178
EECOM? Surgeon?
Go.

55:47.219 --> 55:50.306
CAPCOM we're go to continue with PDI.

55:50.346 --> 55:51.932
The principle challenge was,

55:51.974 --> 55:55.727
"Did I have enough information once we started down?"

55:55.769 --> 55:59.148
And we have to update the computer's knowledge

55:59.190 --> 56:01.483
of altitude above the lunar surface.

56:03.235 --> 56:04.736
Okay, we got data back.

56:04.778 --> 56:06.071
Radar, Flight, looks good.

56:06.113 --> 56:07.405
Rog.

56:07.447 --> 56:08.740
Good news.

56:08.782 --> 56:12.536
The landing radar catches on at 39,000 feet.

56:12.577 --> 56:14.913
I thought my big problem for the day was over.

56:16.123 --> 56:18.750
Unfortunately, it was just starting.

56:21.712 --> 56:23.088
Stand by.

56:26.800 --> 56:31.513
1202.
Oh, my goodness, one of those codes that we had during the sim.

56:31.555 --> 56:34.641
It was like the...the sim wasn't exactly that, but it was close,

56:34.683 --> 56:38.812
and I was frantically trying to remember which code that was.

56:38.854 --> 56:41.690
Well, when that came, I thought we were dead in the water.

56:47.154 --> 56:49.073
Yeah, the same thing we had.

56:54.953 --> 56:57.789
We get the information that it says 1202,

56:58.874 --> 57:00.542
but I'm still trying to remember,

57:00.584 --> 57:04.796
and Jack Garman is screaming,
"Steve, it's on our little list!"

57:04.838 --> 57:07.341
And I just finally...by the time I see my list,

57:07.383 --> 57:12.054
he was about several seconds before I was and I said...

57:12.096 --> 57:13.555
We're go on that, Flight.

57:13.597 --> 57:15.431
We're go on that alarm?

57:17.601 --> 57:20.020
If it doesn't reoccur, we'll be go.

57:20.062 --> 57:23.648
And that took us all of 20 seconds maybe,

57:23.690 --> 57:27.444
but that's a lifetime in the middle of powered descent.

57:27.485 --> 57:30.155
Bales knew that it was still flying the machine,

57:30.197 --> 57:32.699
and we were still going.

57:32.741 --> 57:35.744
Delta H is looking good now.

57:35.786 --> 57:37.913
Okay, all flight controllers, hang tight.

57:37.955 --> 57:39.373
Should be throttling down pretty shortly.

57:42.459 --> 57:44.502
Okay, all flight controllers, go/no-go for landing.

57:44.544 --> 57:45.462
Retro?
Go.

57:45.503 --> 57:46.504
Fido? Guidance?
Go. Go.

57:46.546 --> 57:47.547
Control?
Go.

57:47.589 --> 57:48.465
Telcom?
Go.

57:48.506 --> 57:50.134
GNC? EECOM?
Go. Go.

57:50.175 --> 57:52.094
CAPCOM, we're go for landing.

58:04.189 --> 58:05.732
Same type. We're Go, Flight.

58:05.774 --> 58:06.942
Okay, we're Go.

58:09.111 --> 58:11.863
And then, as he pitched over,

58:11.905 --> 58:14.532
there was a big boulder field down there, and he can't land.

58:17.453 --> 58:20.331
There's craters in there, there's big boulders in there.

58:23.459 --> 58:26.544
Somebody said that Armstrong's thought
he just got a 50-50 chance

58:26.586 --> 58:29.131
they would get to land on it or have to abort.

58:32.092 --> 58:35.887
And I think he was probably
the coolest hand out there on that day,

58:35.929 --> 58:40.809
and he had thought about this
a hundred times or more, in terms of landing it.

58:43.603 --> 58:45.189
He had to level off,

58:45.230 --> 58:50.861
then he had to fly horizontally to get over this boulder field.

58:50.902 --> 58:54.614
Well, that took a lot of extra gas.

58:54.656 --> 58:58.618
As we kept going down, the low level sensor tripped,

58:58.660 --> 59:01.163
and said if fuel dropped below this point...

59:01.205 --> 59:03.248
Low level. Low level.

59:03.290 --> 59:05.417
Now we're almost run out of gas.

59:05.459 --> 59:06.751
Fuel critical.

59:06.793 --> 59:08.670
I started the stopwatch.

59:10.381 --> 59:12.799
We're down at one lunar G hovering,

59:12.841 --> 59:14.176
and I know how fast that uses fuel,

59:14.218 --> 59:16.553
and I know how many seconds are left.

59:19.097 --> 59:24.561
I was giving a running, uh, commentary for Mission Control,

59:24.602 --> 59:27.147
and Deke Slayton was sitting to my right.

59:27.189 --> 59:29.483
He was Director of Flight Crew Operations,

59:29.525 --> 59:31.402
and he punched me in the side

59:31.443 --> 59:35.739
and said, "Shut up, Charlie, let 'em land".

59:35.780 --> 59:38.867
I think we better be quiet now.

59:38.909 --> 59:41.328
Okay, the only call outs from now on will be fuel.

59:43.914 --> 59:46.666
Okay, Bob, I'll be standing by for your call outs shortly.

59:46.708 --> 59:47.959
On my stopwatch,

59:48.001 --> 59:49.878
I put a little piece of Scotch tape and said,

59:49.920 --> 59:52.839
Okay, at this point now, we'll have 60 seconds left.

59:52.881 --> 59:55.967
And a little up further, we got 30 seconds left.

59:56.009 --> 59:58.887
And a little further, we got zero.

59:58.929 --> 01:00:03.392
We were set up so that the astronaut knew

01:00:03.434 --> 01:00:04.851
when you reached a point,

01:00:04.893 --> 01:00:08.605
either he's going to land or he's going to abort.

01:00:08.646 --> 01:00:13.277
I am convinced that within 100 feet of the moon,

01:00:13.318 --> 01:00:16.654
I'd have called "abort", he would've continued his descent.

01:00:20.867 --> 01:00:22.369
Sixty.
Sixty seconds.

01:00:24.788 --> 01:00:27.665
And that control room got quiet.

01:00:30.668 --> 01:00:36.716
It just felt like everybody was just glued
to their consoles and holding their breath.

01:00:36.758 --> 01:00:40.887
The last 10 or 12 seconds of that landing was very tense.

01:00:40.929 --> 01:00:43.390
You know, are we gonna do this or not?

01:00:45.809 --> 01:00:47.227
And I was looking at the altitude

01:00:47.269 --> 01:00:48.770
and I thought we're not gonna make it.

01:00:48.812 --> 01:00:51.773
There's no way. There's too much altitude for us to drop,

01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:55.527
but I didn't know we were in a crater.

01:00:55.569 --> 01:00:58.989
And when they come up to the lip of the crater,

01:00:55.569 --> 01:00:58.989
you only come along here,

01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:01.032
and I'm showing this much altitude.

01:01:01.074 --> 01:01:04.035
When they come over on the plateau, bam,

01:01:04.077 --> 01:01:05.703
it did a step jump.

01:01:09.207 --> 01:01:12.669
And shortly after that, Buzz said, "I see dust".

01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:15.255
Ah, it was a sigh of relief.

01:01:15.297 --> 01:01:17.633
Putting feet down.
Two and a half.

01:01:17.674 --> 01:01:19.510
Picking up some dust.

01:01:19.551 --> 01:01:22.053
Three feet.

01:01:19.551 --> 01:01:22.053
Two and a half down.
Big saddle.

01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:25.723
Four forward.

01:01:25.765 --> 01:01:27.684
Four forward.
Moving it to the right a little.

01:01:27.725 --> 01:01:29.894
Thirty seconds and a half.

01:01:29.936 --> 01:01:30.937
Thirty seconds.

01:01:38.695 --> 01:01:40.197
Contact light.

01:01:42.157 --> 01:01:43.617
Okay, engine stopped.

01:01:43.659 --> 01:01:46.036
ACA out of descent.

01:01:46.077 --> 01:01:47.037
Prepare to shut down.

01:01:48.455 --> 01:01:52.000
We landed with 18 seconds left

01:01:48.455 --> 01:01:52.000
on the stopwatch.

01:01:52.042 --> 01:01:54.002
We copy you down, Eagle.

01:01:54.044 --> 01:01:57.214
Okay, standby for T1.

01:01:59.174 --> 01:02:02.135
Tranquility Base here, "The Eagle has landed".

01:02:02.177 --> 01:02:05.472
Roger, Tranquility. We copy you're on the ground.

01:02:05.514 --> 01:02:07.474
You got a bunch of guys about to turn blue.

01:02:07.516 --> 01:02:09.100
We're breathing again.
Thanks a lot.

01:02:11.895 --> 01:02:13.647
Thank you.

01:02:13.689 --> 01:02:16.149
You're looking good here.

01:02:16.191 --> 01:02:18.443
Okay, we're gonna be busy for a minute.

01:02:32.332 --> 01:02:33.709
Then it finally dawned on us,

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:35.711
you know, we just landed on the moon.

01:02:38.463 --> 01:02:42.217
And we're not talking about
landing in an airport or something here.

01:02:42.259 --> 01:02:44.469
We're talking about landing on the moon.

01:02:44.511 --> 01:02:47.097
Okay, keep the chatter down in this room.

01:02:49.391 --> 01:02:51.602
Everybody's applauding behind us in the control room,

01:02:51.643 --> 01:02:54.229
but we've got to stay totally focused.

01:02:54.271 --> 01:02:57.774
Is it safe to remain here for the next two minutes, yes or no?

01:02:57.815 --> 01:02:59.817
Is the space craft going to tip over, fall over?

01:02:59.859 --> 01:03:01.695
Are we in a crater? Are we sliding down?

01:03:01.737 --> 01:03:03.697
So we had a variety of questions we had to answer.

01:03:03.739 --> 01:03:06.950
Okay, T1.
Stay/no-stay. Retro?

01:03:06.991 --> 01:03:07.825
Stay.
Fido?

01:03:07.867 --> 01:03:09.077
Stay.
Guidance?

01:03:09.119 --> 01:03:11.747
I remember Kranz went around "stay/no stay".

01:03:11.788 --> 01:03:13.624
Of course you couldn't say "Go/no-go".

01:03:13.665 --> 01:03:16.251
You had say "stay/no-stay", and so we said "stay".
Everybody said "stay".

01:03:20.464 --> 01:03:22.758
Right after this, the final stay/no-stay,

01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:24.801
somebody grabs me by the shoulders.

01:03:24.842 --> 01:03:27.178
And I looked up and I said, "Oh my God".

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:31.725
Chris Kraft was also in charge of the software,

01:03:31.767 --> 01:03:34.436
of the computer software,

01:03:34.478 --> 01:03:37.855
managing it before the first Apollo flights.

01:03:37.897 --> 01:03:40.734
And so he knew what could have happened.

01:03:40.776 --> 01:03:42.694
He knew the rules pretty well,

01:03:42.736 --> 01:03:46.364
and yeah, that was really..that was really quite a thing.

01:03:55.332 --> 01:03:58.627
To finally get there and to be down there is...

01:03:58.669 --> 01:04:02.380
First time, you know, in the history

01:03:58.669 --> 01:04:02.380
of the human race,

01:04:02.422 --> 01:04:04.424
that anybody has done something like that.

01:04:06.050 --> 01:04:08.720
And it's like, the team delivered this.

01:04:11.389 --> 01:04:13.057
It was impressive.

01:04:13.099 --> 01:04:16.311
This was the ultimate, ultimate, ultimate

01:04:16.353 --> 01:04:19.063
testing of the teams in Mission Control

01:04:19.105 --> 01:04:20.315
and the culture established there.

01:04:22.734 --> 01:04:24.861
And eventually, we did a shift change,

01:04:26.363 --> 01:04:30.950
and I stopped to get something to eat,

01:04:26.363 --> 01:04:30.950
some breakfast.

01:04:30.992 --> 01:04:34.621
And as I walked in, I bought a newspaper.

01:04:34.663 --> 01:04:36.498
Well, that newspaper's about three inches thick.

01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:39.417
I still happen to have that newspaper by the way.

01:04:39.459 --> 01:04:43.296
And, uh, I sat down at the counter

01:04:43.338 --> 01:04:47.217
and I ordered my scrambled eggs,
and I'm drinking my coffee,

01:04:47.258 --> 01:04:51.847
and I'm looking at all of this,
we've landed on the moon, all the things.

01:04:51.888 --> 01:04:55.517
Two guys walked in and sat down next to me,

01:04:55.559 --> 01:04:57.185
and one of them said to the other one, he said,

01:04:57.227 --> 01:05:00.980
"You know, I landed in Normandy on D-Day".

01:05:02.482 --> 01:05:03.775
And I'm listening,

01:05:04.693 --> 01:05:07.529
and then he said,

01:05:07.571 --> 01:05:11.074
I was never prouder to be an American than yesterday.

01:05:11.115 --> 01:05:12.617
We landed on the moon.

01:05:14.118 --> 01:05:16.872
It then hit me what we had done.

01:06:11.468 --> 01:06:13.553
The man that has been selected tonight

01:06:13.595 --> 01:06:16.389
to receive this group achievement award

01:06:16.431 --> 01:06:19.935
for the whole 400,000 who, in one way or another,

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:24.648
have contributed to the success
of this program is a young man.

01:06:24.689 --> 01:06:28.234
Steve Bales, when the computers seemed to be confused

01:06:28.276 --> 01:06:30.612
and when he could have said "stop",

01:06:30.654 --> 01:06:33.490
or when he could have said "wait", said "go".

01:06:34.658 --> 01:06:35.784
Thank you, Mr. President.

01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:50.799
Apollo 12...

01:06:54.093 --> 01:06:56.137
started off just like any other mission.

01:06:56.179 --> 01:07:00.767
The countdown for Apollo 12 still going at this time.

01:07:00.809 --> 01:07:04.312
Project officials are still keeping
a close eye on this weather front

01:07:04.354 --> 01:07:09.484
that has moved into the area more rapidly
than anticipated earlier this morning.

01:07:09.526 --> 01:07:12.069
I got a flight awareness award.

01:07:13.446 --> 01:07:15.866
So I got to go down to watch the launch.

01:07:15.907 --> 01:07:18.785
T-minus 20.

01:07:18.827 --> 01:07:21.245
I'm sitting out there in the rain,

01:07:21.287 --> 01:07:23.039
three miles away.

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:25.792
We have guidance internal.

01:07:25.834 --> 01:07:29.629
Ten, nine, eight...Ignition sequence start.

01:07:29.671 --> 01:07:35.886
Six, five, four, three, two, one, zero.

01:07:35.927 --> 01:07:38.638
All engines running.
Commence liftoff.

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:42.893
We have liftoff at 11:22 AM. Eastern Standard Time.

01:07:44.728 --> 01:07:48.231
The Saturn V was a powerful vehicle,

01:07:48.272 --> 01:07:51.902
and once one lights off, you can feel your clothes pulsating.

01:07:51.943 --> 01:07:53.319
Tower clear.

01:07:56.447 --> 01:07:58.909
I'm feeling pretty spunky.

01:07:58.950 --> 01:08:01.995
You know, here's my first time as a lead flight director,

01:08:02.037 --> 01:08:03.830
a launch flight director, you know.

01:08:03.872 --> 01:08:06.374
Pete Conrad reporting the roll and pitch program

01:08:06.416 --> 01:08:08.418
to put Apollo 12 on the proper course.

01:08:08.459 --> 01:08:11.421
Thirty or so seconds into the flight...

01:08:12.881 --> 01:08:14.716
Roger, Pete.

01:08:16.843 --> 01:08:19.763
I see two streaks of lightening down each side of the vehicle.

01:08:20.889 --> 01:08:23.265
Wow, the crew came alive.

01:08:28.979 --> 01:08:31.899
All the data went blank.

01:08:31.942 --> 01:08:36.279
All my console lights, I mean, just lit up

01:08:31.942 --> 01:08:36.279
like a Christmas tree.

01:08:36.319 --> 01:08:38.322
And I watched John. John just sat there.

01:08:38.363 --> 01:08:40.283
I don't remember him talking to the back room.

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:51.127
The thought that I had first is,

01:08:51.167 --> 01:08:54.923
I'm going to be the first guy that has to call an abort.

01:08:56.758 --> 01:08:58.175
I looked at my data...

01:08:58.216 --> 01:09:00.428
And he just stared at the data and stared at the data...

01:09:01.845 --> 01:09:05.058
I said, "John", I said, "Talk to the back room",

01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:06.684
and John ignored me.

01:09:07.769 --> 01:09:09.062
And all of a sudden,

01:09:09.104 --> 01:09:12.439
there was some patterns and stuff on the screen.

01:09:12.482 --> 01:09:15.568
I wasn't too sure at first what they were.

01:09:15.609 --> 01:09:18.654
but then, then I said, you know,
I thought to myself, I've seen this.

01:09:18.696 --> 01:09:20.948
Bang, I've seen this before.

01:09:20.991 --> 01:09:23.827
And it turned out he had seen what the data would look like

01:09:23.868 --> 01:09:25.996
from a ground test which he remembered.

01:09:26.037 --> 01:09:27.663
And that's when it clicked.

01:09:27.705 --> 01:09:30.207
The Signal Conditioning Equipment, SCE.

01:09:36.255 --> 01:09:41.176
And then John Aaron said,
"Flight, tell 'em to go SCE to AUX".

01:09:45.682 --> 01:09:48.184
And Jerry Carr said, "What?"

01:09:48.225 --> 01:09:49.393
What is that?"

01:09:49.435 --> 01:09:51.813
John came in over top of both of us and said,

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:54.983
"Signal Conditioning Equipment to Auxiliary".

01:09:55.025 --> 01:09:56.734
It went to the space craft.

01:10:06.577 --> 01:10:09.372
Al Bean knew where the switch was.

01:10:09.413 --> 01:10:10.790
He reached down, he flipped it,

01:10:10.832 --> 01:10:14.169
and as soon as he did, voila, we had it all back.

01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:16.004
We got it back, Flight, looks good.

01:10:16.046 --> 01:10:17.421
Okay.

01:10:17.463 --> 01:10:20.967
Now, it's that SCE to AUX fixed the problem.

01:10:21.009 --> 01:10:25.680
SCE to AUX was the thing that
allowed me to get the data back.

01:10:25.722 --> 01:10:27.724
But the one thing I kept looking at

01:10:27.765 --> 01:10:31.769
was the trajectory plot,
which we had on a big display in the front.

01:10:31.811 --> 01:10:33.270
It was right on.

01:10:47.869 --> 01:10:50.413
And that's when I told Gerry, I said,

01:10:50.454 --> 01:10:53.332
Look don't put yourself under so much pressure.

01:10:53.374 --> 01:10:57.087
We don't have to go to the moon today.

01:10:57.128 --> 01:10:59.923
We can just do some tests, and the three of them

01:10:57.128 --> 01:11:02.842
will come home, and go the next time .

01:11:02.884 --> 01:11:06.470
And all he was really saying is, "Your call", you know.

01:11:06.512 --> 01:11:08.347
I said, "Well, it's your job.

01:11:08.389 --> 01:11:12.060
You know, that's what you guys know better than I do,

01:11:08.389 --> 01:11:12.060
how to do this.

01:11:12.102 --> 01:11:16.022
I just want you to know that
you don't have to be under the hammer,

01:11:16.064 --> 01:11:19.776
or the pressure of making a bad decision,

01:11:19.817 --> 01:11:21.444
so you make a good one...

01:11:22.695 --> 01:11:25.156
and I'll accept it.

01:11:25.198 --> 01:11:28.785
But we kept checking things out, and sure enough,

01:11:28.826 --> 01:11:32.747
it was okay, so we...let's go for TLI.

01:11:32.789 --> 01:11:35.458
So here we went.

01:11:35.499 --> 01:11:41.672
And, you know, the mission after that was

01:11:35.499 --> 01:11:41.672
one of the cleanest we ever had.

01:11:52.516 --> 01:11:55.436
And we had a hell of a party, I remember that.

01:12:03.527 --> 01:12:05.863
After splashdown,

01:12:05.905 --> 01:12:08.616
we would go down to 'The Singing Wheel'
and all have a beer together.

01:12:08.658 --> 01:12:11.035
We would party and just have a great time.

01:12:14.289 --> 01:12:16.916
Splashdown parties were, uh,

01:12:16.958 --> 01:12:22.713
a lot of good-natured joking back and forth
with the other disciplines.

01:12:22.755 --> 01:12:25.967
Like, you know, "Boy, you really screwed that one up today".

01:12:26.009 --> 01:12:29.720
It was eyeball to eyeball, pointing fingers
and shaking fists at each other.

01:12:29.762 --> 01:12:33.766
You didn't pull any punches, but everybody was friends.

01:12:31.472 --> 01:12:33.766
There's no doubt about that.

01:12:33.808 --> 01:12:35.643
I mean, we were all in this together.

01:12:42.692 --> 01:12:44.861
Drank a lot of beer.

01:12:44.902 --> 01:12:47.363
It was really a terrific time.

01:12:49.365 --> 01:12:51.617
Made us all a better team for it, I think.

01:13:18.895 --> 01:13:20.688
I got to the Control Center

01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:24.025
and I was due to go on shift an hour later.

01:13:24.067 --> 01:13:26.236
Uh, everything seemed to be going fine.

01:13:44.254 --> 01:13:48.091
Normally, the last hour of the eight-hour shift,

01:13:48.132 --> 01:13:50.843
we would prepare the crew for their sleep period.

01:13:50.885 --> 01:13:55.056
And there were certain things that
we had in the checklist that had to be done.

01:13:55.098 --> 01:13:59.476
One of the items was stir the cryos, oxygen and hydrogen.

01:13:59.518 --> 01:14:01.520
Initiate EECOM.

01:14:01.562 --> 01:14:03.106
Go ahead, COM.

01:14:03.147 --> 01:14:05.942
You got your stir now in the O2?

01:14:05.983 --> 01:14:07.985
So we stirred the cryos.

01:14:10.113 --> 01:14:12.323
And all hell broke loose.

01:14:14.658 --> 01:14:16.660
What's the matter with the data, EECOM?

01:14:16.702 --> 01:14:18.704
We got more of a problem.

01:14:18.746 --> 01:14:20.373
Okay, listen, listen, you guys,

01:14:20.415 --> 01:14:23.876
We've lost, uh, fuel cell one and two pressure.

01:14:23.918 --> 01:14:26.212
We lost O2 tank 2 pressure.

01:14:26.254 --> 01:14:27.797
GNC, you wanna look at it?

01:14:29.966 --> 01:14:32.176
Okay. Stand by, they got a problem.

01:14:32.218 --> 01:14:34.553
Well, basically, I had a whole bunch of problems reported to me.

01:14:34.595 --> 01:14:36.639
I was wondering which one he was talking about.

01:14:45.022 --> 01:14:46.941
I came in and plugged it back in.

01:14:46.983 --> 01:14:49.444
Sat down next to Gene.

01:14:49.485 --> 01:14:53.030
The first reaction was, well,
look maybe we're having an electrical problem here

01:14:53.072 --> 01:14:56.909
and it affects the telemetry and the instrumentation.

01:14:56.951 --> 01:14:59.703
You see an AC bus undervolt there, EECOM?

01:14:59.745 --> 01:15:01.122
Negative, Flight.

01:15:01.164 --> 01:15:02.915
We may have had an instrumentation problem, Flight.

01:15:02.957 --> 01:15:04.167
Rog.

01:15:04.208 --> 01:15:05.228
I said,

01:15:05.328 --> 01:15:11.548
I think we've had an instrumentation problem flight
and that was probably the biggest understatement

01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:13.009
in the history of manned space flight.

01:15:13.050 --> 01:15:16.137
I mean, I couldn't have been more wrong.

01:15:16.179 --> 01:15:18.639
Well, let's get some recommendation here, Sy,

01:15:18.681 --> 01:15:20.266
if you got any better ideas.

01:15:22.893 --> 01:15:27.940
Naturally, I got a little panicky.

01:15:27.982 --> 01:15:31.652
You know, when you begin to panic,
this gorge comes up in your throat

01:15:31.694 --> 01:15:35.531
where you get to the point of fight or flight,

01:15:35.572 --> 01:15:38.868
and a fleeting thought of getting up and
going home did pass my mind,

01:15:38.909 --> 01:15:43.664
and of course, that was not an option and I knew that.

01:15:45.958 --> 01:15:48.044
Can we review our status here, Sy,

01:15:48.085 --> 01:15:50.587
and see what we've got from a standpoint of status?

01:15:50.629 --> 01:15:52.798
What do you think we've got in the space craft that's good?

01:15:54.008 --> 01:15:56.427
Stand by, Flight.

01:15:56.469 --> 01:15:58.595
So, and then when I got settled down,

01:15:58.637 --> 01:15:59.687
I said,

01:15:59.787 --> 01:16:05.228
You know, it does appear we've actually lost
two fuel cells and I really don't know why.

01:16:10.607 --> 01:16:12.151
We didn't know what happened.

01:16:13.652 --> 01:16:15.863
It wasn't until I looked out the window...

01:16:17.114 --> 01:16:19.700
that I realized how serious we were.

01:16:33.839 --> 01:16:36.633
When I saw that oxygen being expelled,

01:16:36.675 --> 01:16:40.346
I realized it was not just oxygen

01:16:40.388 --> 01:16:43.266
but the electrical power and the propulsion system.

01:16:49.188 --> 01:16:52.775
It was beginning to dawn on the Control Center

01:16:52.816 --> 01:16:58.822
that maybe this is a real problem that
we got here and, uh, it's not gonna go away.

01:17:00.783 --> 01:17:03.411
Uh, Flight, we're gonna hit 100 PSI

01:17:03.453 --> 01:17:05.496
in and hour and 54 minutes.

01:17:07.248 --> 01:17:10.251
That's the end, right there.

01:17:10.293 --> 01:17:15.965
And that is where, basically,
my frame of mind changed to survival mode.

01:17:16.006 --> 01:17:17.841
I call my controllers and say,

01:17:17.883 --> 01:17:20.010
Okay, all flight controllers,
settle down, quit your guessing.

01:17:20.052 --> 01:17:21.637
Let's start working this problem.

01:17:23.347 --> 01:17:26.642
Okay, now, let's everybody keep cool.

01:17:26.683 --> 01:17:28.436
Let's make sure that we don't do anything

01:17:28.478 --> 01:17:31.855
that's going to blow our electrical power with the batteries

01:17:31.897 --> 01:17:34.817
or that will cause us to lose fuel cell number two.

01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:40.781
We've got the command module system,

01:17:40.823 --> 01:17:44.118
so we're in good shape if we need to get home.

01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:48.289
Let's solve the problem but
let's not make it any worse by guessing.

01:17:51.917 --> 01:17:54.086
Here is a bulletin from ABC News.

01:17:54.128 --> 01:17:58.424
The Apollo 13 spacecraft has had
a serious power supply malfunction

01:17:58.466 --> 01:18:01.636
that could cause the lunar landing mission to be terminated early.

01:18:06.265 --> 01:18:09.101
You know, we all came in

01:18:09.143 --> 01:18:10.811
to do what we could to help out.

01:18:10.853 --> 01:18:15.358
People came from everywhere, all across the country.

01:18:15.399 --> 01:18:21.030
When I got there, of course,
I went to the back room, it was chaos.

01:18:21.071 --> 01:18:24.241
They were still trying to recover
their sanity from what had happened,

01:18:24.283 --> 01:18:27.578
and they were beginning to regroup.

01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:29.788
I didn't even initially put on a headset.

01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:32.375
I just walked behind the consoles

01:18:32.416 --> 01:18:36.379
and listened to them over the voice ways,
what problem were they working.

01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:39.340
That damn room was in serious confusion.

01:18:41.425 --> 01:18:44.803
And it took me a while to come to
that conclusion, but it was true.

01:18:49.141 --> 01:18:53.437
Failure was, for quite a while during that period of time,

01:18:53.479 --> 01:18:55.481
may have not been an option,

01:18:55.523 --> 01:18:59.860
but it was out there lurking, uh, in a dark sky.

01:18:59.902 --> 01:19:04.990
It was just...it was just almost daring us to make a mistake.

01:19:15.167 --> 01:19:18.212
They were slowly losing electrical power,

01:19:18.254 --> 01:19:21.882
and it wasn't going to be long until all the fuel cells
were offline, so now we're on entry battery.

01:19:25.844 --> 01:19:28.389
I walked up and sat down next to the EECOM.

01:19:28.431 --> 01:19:30.933
Sy Liebergot, he was on there, I said,

01:19:30.974 --> 01:19:35.020
Sy, this problem, you're not gonna fix this one.

01:19:37.022 --> 01:19:39.400
So I said, "You gotta shut the Command Module down".

01:19:42.737 --> 01:19:45.406
And you can imagine the reluctance to do that.

01:19:45.448 --> 01:19:46.699
Flight, EECOM.

01:19:46.741 --> 01:19:48.618
Go ahead, EECOM.

01:19:48.659 --> 01:19:51.203
The pressure in O2 tank 1 is all the way down to 297.

01:19:51.245 --> 01:19:54.039
We better think about getting in the LM,
or using the LM systems.

01:19:59.211 --> 01:20:01.672
We were in serious, serious trouble,

01:20:01.714 --> 01:20:06.552
and the only way that we could possibly save ourselves

01:20:06.594 --> 01:20:08.345
was using the Lunar Module.

01:20:19.315 --> 01:20:21.942
Ordinarily, when you're going out towards the moon,

01:20:21.984 --> 01:20:26.822
you can turn around and burn the big engine
straight at the Earth and get back.

01:20:26.863 --> 01:20:29.825
However, the big engine just had a big problem back there

01:20:29.866 --> 01:20:31.285
and we didn't know how bad that was.

01:20:31.327 --> 01:20:34.079
We could actually do a big burn

01:20:34.121 --> 01:20:37.500
with the descent engine on the Lunar Module.

01:20:37.541 --> 01:20:40.711
There was not that much longer to go around the moon.

01:20:40.753 --> 01:20:43.714
So my input was let's get on a free return right away.

01:20:53.223 --> 01:20:55.351
This is Apollo Control, Houston,

01:20:55.392 --> 01:20:59.896
here in Mission Control, we're looking...
now looking towards an alternate mission.

01:20:59.938 --> 01:21:05.653
Swinging around the moon and
using the Lunar Module power systems,

01:21:05.695 --> 01:21:08.864
because of the situation that has developed here this evening.

01:21:11.867 --> 01:21:15.996
I had to maneuver to get back into an attitude

01:21:16.038 --> 01:21:17.707
which Mission Control figured out.

01:21:19.082 --> 01:21:22.169
And there I learned something very important,

01:21:22.211 --> 01:21:26.590
because the Lunar Module had never been designed

01:21:26.632 --> 01:21:33.430
to be maneuvered with the Command Service Module

01:21:26.632 --> 01:21:33.430
attached.

01:21:33.472 --> 01:21:37.059
So I literally had to learn, in a short period of time,

01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:39.812
how to maneuver the space craft,

01:21:39.854 --> 01:21:44.358
but I got that technique, fired the Lunar Module engine,

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:47.653
and that put us back on the free return course.

01:22:00.791 --> 01:22:04.002
We are about 70 hours from home,

01:22:04.044 --> 01:22:08.131
and we have a plan for carrying out the rest of the mission,

01:22:08.173 --> 01:22:12.177
but there is gonna be no relaxation at all

01:22:12.219 --> 01:22:14.722
as far as that goes, from now until splash.

01:22:14.764 --> 01:22:20.269
I did not appreciate how much reaction we were getting

01:22:20.310 --> 01:22:22.271
from the outside world.

01:22:22.312 --> 01:22:28.151
It didn't sink on me till later
how connected everybody seemed to feel

01:22:28.193 --> 01:22:30.195
with these three guys.

01:22:30.237 --> 01:22:33.449
Uh, you know, they didn't even

01:22:30.237 --> 01:22:33.449
know them, didn't know their names or anything,

01:22:33.490 --> 01:22:38.370
but the whole world seemed to be united

01:22:38.412 --> 01:22:41.498
in pulling for this to come off well.

01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:44.126
The situation is extremely critical

01:22:44.167 --> 01:22:45.961
and we are monitoring it at all times.

01:22:46.002 --> 01:22:48.380
We'll be back with another report at 12.30

01:22:48.422 --> 01:22:51.508
and then you can see a full analysis of
what's happening at 1:00.

01:22:59.809 --> 01:23:01.435
We all smoked.

01:23:03.145 --> 01:23:07.316
And when I say smoked, we really smoked.

01:23:07.357 --> 01:23:09.777
When you went into the Control Room,
you came in that side door,

01:23:09.819 --> 01:23:11.779
and when you opened that door,

01:23:11.821 --> 01:23:13.697
a cloud of smoke came out the door.

01:23:13.739 --> 01:23:15.407
That's how much smoke there was.

01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:22.623
Apollo 13 brought out some very interesting things

01:23:22.665 --> 01:23:26.293
because it wasn't like you got cleaned up and
dressed to come to work

01:23:26.335 --> 01:23:27.878
and put on your shirt and tie

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:31.089
and brushed your teeth, and used your underarm deodorant,

01:23:31.131 --> 01:23:32.967
you went running, right.

01:23:33.008 --> 01:23:36.345
We were there for 35 hours... straight.

01:23:36.386 --> 01:23:40.140
I think I wore the same set of clothes
for at least three or four, five days.

01:23:40.182 --> 01:23:42.685
I slept in SSR on the floor.

01:23:44.102 --> 01:23:46.062
I was under a table back then.

01:23:46.104 --> 01:23:48.524
It was pretty ripe.

01:23:48.565 --> 01:23:51.735
Sleep meant nothing, change of shifts meant nothing,

01:23:51.777 --> 01:23:53.946
personal problems meant nothing.

01:23:53.988 --> 01:23:57.240
There was only one thing for 48 hours...

01:23:57.282 --> 01:24:02.538
that the entire team of people, led by Mission Control,

01:24:02.579 --> 01:24:06.208
the guys could not solve their problem up there in space.

01:24:06.249 --> 01:24:09.336
There was only one thing on their mind,

01:24:11.005 --> 01:24:13.716
to get those guys home.

01:24:13.757 --> 01:24:15.592
We had been trained to think,

01:24:15.634 --> 01:24:19.054
don't ever give up as long as you've got options.

01:24:19.095 --> 01:24:20.556
And we never ran out of options.

01:24:20.597 --> 01:24:22.975
The team was just non-stop.

01:24:23.017 --> 01:24:27.062
The whole way back, people just kept inventing new things,

01:24:27.103 --> 01:24:29.690
new innovations and new ways to do things.

01:24:31.901 --> 01:24:37.197
It's a question of having this incredible ability

01:24:37.239 --> 01:24:40.367
to basically make sense out of things

01:24:40.409 --> 01:24:42.995
that were almost beyond our comprehension,

01:24:43.037 --> 01:24:46.999
and find the piece parts where we could start

01:24:43.037 --> 01:24:46.999
fitting them together

01:24:47.041 --> 01:24:48.876
and start pulling this puzzle back.

01:24:57.384 --> 01:25:01.179
I could see the Earth starting 
o get bigger and bigger really,

01:25:01.221 --> 01:25:05.559
realized that we had to have instructions

01:25:05.601 --> 01:25:09.688
of the best way to power up the Command Module.

01:25:11.523 --> 01:25:14.693
And so I kept asking, very politely at the time,

01:25:14.735 --> 01:25:16.946
"Do you have those instructions?"

01:25:16.987 --> 01:25:20.282
And they said, "We're working on it, we're working on it".

01:25:21.951 --> 01:25:24.119
The original power-up document

01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:28.874
started off with John Aaron and I on a blackboard.

01:25:28.916 --> 01:25:32.502
We kinda drew some things on the board, some rough ideas,

01:25:32.544 --> 01:25:35.798
that was the beginning of the document.

01:25:35.839 --> 01:25:40.010
I knew basically what equipment you had
to have on to do a certain function.

01:25:40.052 --> 01:25:42.137
That then started the whole process

01:25:42.178 --> 01:25:46.308
of how to build all the detail switches and circuit breakers,

01:25:46.349 --> 01:25:48.560
what sequence you had to do this in,

01:25:48.602 --> 01:25:50.145
and it's all very compressed.

01:25:50.186 --> 01:25:52.856
From there it just started growing,

01:25:52.898 --> 01:25:59.113
and people would start inputting
their piece of their turf, their territory.

01:25:59.154 --> 01:26:02.449
And one organization wanted this.

01:26:02.491 --> 01:26:04.576
Well, that had to come back into the document,

01:26:04.618 --> 01:26:06.120
and actually through John and I to say,

01:26:06.161 --> 01:26:10.290
"Hey, can we afford to do that power-wise?"

01:26:10.332 --> 01:26:13.919
And we worked out all the bugs, all the procedures,

01:26:13.961 --> 01:26:18.090
and the final document was, of course,
then approved and read to the crew.

01:26:20.134 --> 01:26:22.552
Tomorrow morning, Eastern time,

01:26:22.594 --> 01:26:25.597
the space craft will approach the Earth looking like this.

01:26:25.639 --> 01:26:27.641
This is the way it looks now.

01:26:27.683 --> 01:26:31.103
About five hours before it reaches the Earth's atmosphere,

01:26:31.145 --> 01:26:35.315
the men in the Command Module will jettison this part here

01:26:35.357 --> 01:26:37.026
called the Command...The Service Module,

01:26:37.067 --> 01:26:39.153
and it'll float away in space.

01:26:39.194 --> 01:26:41.905
That will leave these two parts of the space craft,

01:26:41.947 --> 01:26:45.492
the LM here and the Command Module here.

01:27:08.807 --> 01:27:11.476
I don't remember saying, "Hey, man, we've done it",

01:27:11.518 --> 01:27:14.270
because we hadn't yet, okay.

01:27:14.312 --> 01:27:17.191
There were still so many variables involved

01:27:17.232 --> 01:27:20.986
that, you know, I was just hoping what we did was right.

01:27:21.028 --> 01:27:26.324
We didn't know whether the explosion
that we now knew had occurred,

01:27:27.868 --> 01:27:31.246
what the entire effect was on the Command Module.

01:27:33.082 --> 01:27:36.459
We don't know whether the heat shield's been damaged or what,

01:27:36.501 --> 01:27:42.549
and has everything we have done
to save the crew going to work.

01:28:22.422 --> 01:28:25.968
Well, on all of the returning flights,

01:28:26.009 --> 01:28:27.636
we have what we call "blackout".

01:28:32.348 --> 01:28:35.811
There's a period where they blackout

01:28:35.852 --> 01:28:38.438
because of ionization, the heat.

01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:40.107
And you couldn't communicate through it.

01:28:40.149 --> 01:28:42.151
So they couldn't talk to you and you couldn't talk to them.

01:28:46.947 --> 01:28:48.907
At this stage in the space program,

01:28:48.949 --> 01:28:53.912
we could compute when blackout will start and
when it will end within a second,

01:28:53.954 --> 01:28:55.122
and we've never missed.

01:28:55.164 --> 01:28:58.333
Well, in this case, it started right on time,

01:28:58.374 --> 01:29:02.212
and then when the time came to come out,

01:29:02.254 --> 01:29:04.256
uh, it didn't happen.

01:29:13.015 --> 01:29:15.851
You know I started thinking,
"Oh, my God", you know,

01:29:15.892 --> 01:29:19.771
here we've done all of these things to get them back home,

01:29:19.813 --> 01:29:23.942
and, uh, something's happened to the heat shield.

01:29:23.984 --> 01:29:28.113
The thoughts going through my mind
at that time is, "They're gone".

01:29:28.155 --> 01:29:31.616
There were concerns relative to the management chain there

01:29:31.658 --> 01:29:33.493
buzzing around that we might have damaged

01:29:33.535 --> 01:29:35.245
heat shield or all that kind of stuff,

01:29:35.287 --> 01:29:36.788
and that's to the point where I just...

01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:38.414
And I think this is true of every controller.

01:29:38.456 --> 01:29:41.793
You put out of your mind those things
you have no control over.

01:29:41.835 --> 01:29:44.129
Don't worry about them, that's the breaks of the game.

01:29:44.171 --> 01:29:46.006
If that's it, so be it.

01:29:55.515 --> 01:29:57.684
So we sat there and we sat there and we sat there,

01:29:57.726 --> 01:30:00.478
and I forget how long it actually was late.

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:03.732
CAPCOM, why don't you try and give 'em a call?

01:30:06.484 --> 01:30:09.529
And all of a sudden,
we got the word from a down-range aircraft

01:30:09.571 --> 01:30:11.823
that ARIA has acquisitioned a signal.

01:30:11.865 --> 01:30:13.158
Bang!

01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:16.203
We almost all fell out of our chairs.

01:30:16.245 --> 01:30:18.454
All of a sudden, it came alive.

01:30:23.835 --> 01:30:27.130
And then the aircraft carrier reported radar contact.

01:30:27.172 --> 01:30:29.174
then they reported a sonic boom and we said,

01:30:29.216 --> 01:30:32.468
"Boy, we're re-entering that sucker".

01:30:34.596 --> 01:30:35.764
Crew was talking.

01:30:35.805 --> 01:30:38.934
The relief of, uh, that they were okay.

01:30:38.975 --> 01:30:42.645
And then once we got contact, we heard from 'em,

01:30:42.687 --> 01:30:44.480
it went to pure elation.

01:31:02.749 --> 01:31:06.753
And there was this television camera view

01:31:06.795 --> 01:31:10.173
looking up at the space craft

01:31:10.215 --> 01:31:12.884
from the deck of the carrier,

01:31:12.926 --> 01:31:17.889
and there were these three big, old balloon chutes.

01:31:20.142 --> 01:31:23.145
You know, the most beautiful sight I'd ever seen.

01:31:54.217 --> 01:31:57.679
The key things is until that crew is on the carrier deck

01:31:57.720 --> 01:32:00.974
and we hand over responsibility from Mission Control

01:32:01.016 --> 01:32:03.810
to the aircraft carrier task force commander,

01:32:03.852 --> 01:32:05.519
and when that is complete,

01:32:05.561 --> 01:32:07.897
then we can start our celebration.

01:32:07.939 --> 01:32:10.150
Here they are.

01:32:10.192 --> 01:32:13.362
James Lovell, John Swigert, and Fred Haise.

01:32:13.403 --> 01:32:17.324
And celebration is always in three phases.

01:32:17.366 --> 01:32:19.284
We light up the ceremonial cigar,

01:32:19.326 --> 01:32:21.370
you pass the thing lit up right along the line.

01:32:23.205 --> 01:32:25.123
And now you open the Control Room doors

01:32:25.165 --> 01:32:27.959
and our back room controllers can come in and join us.

01:32:28.001 --> 01:32:30.045
Those are the real heroes of 13

01:32:30.086 --> 01:32:32.714
because they're the ones who gave...
They're the people who gave us the answers.

01:32:32.755 --> 01:32:35.133
And the third phase in celebration

01:32:35.175 --> 01:32:37.219
is pass out an American flag to every controller,

01:32:37.260 --> 01:32:40.430
and this is one that traditionally Jerry Bostick started,

01:32:40.472 --> 01:32:44.017
back when we set our first space flight record as Americans

01:32:44.059 --> 01:32:46.061
and rendezvousing two space crafts.

01:32:47.979 --> 01:32:51.858
So the end of the mission is, is one of total exhaustion,

01:32:51.900 --> 01:32:55.404
total feat, total exuberance...

01:32:55.445 --> 01:32:57.531
that yes, our crew is home.

01:32:57.571 --> 01:33:00.325
They're safe and we did what we set out to do.

01:33:30.730 --> 01:33:35.151
After the flight, in discussions with the control people,

01:33:35.193 --> 01:33:36.213
I said,

01:33:36.313 --> 01:33:44.202
Well, we thought we would deliberately not talk to you...
so that it might make a good movie one of these days.

01:34:01.761 --> 01:34:05.557
Three, two, one, ignition.

01:34:05.599 --> 01:34:07.309
We're on our way, Houston.

01:34:46.139 --> 01:34:48.016
After the Apollo 1 fire,

01:34:48.057 --> 01:34:53.855
"tough and competent" became
the mantra of the flight control team.

01:34:53.896 --> 01:34:59.444
Those are still the core of the principles and
the foundations that we live by.

01:34:59.486 --> 01:35:02.780
Uh, I don't think that has diminished at all.

01:35:02.822 --> 01:35:05.867
Guys, you can start opening
your cuff checklist to page seven.

01:35:05.908 --> 01:35:07.118
We are in a terminate case.

01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:08.828
Our key priorities are always

01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:11.747
crew safety, vehicle safety, mission success.

01:35:11.789 --> 01:35:13.833
And those don't alter,

01:35:13.875 --> 01:35:17.379
but what "mission success" means changes over time.

01:35:18.796 --> 01:35:21.841
Those folks that flew the early missions,

01:35:21.883 --> 01:35:23.051
they set the standard.

01:35:23.092 --> 01:35:25.928
They went through the fire for us,

01:35:25.970 --> 01:35:31.560
um, and we try to live up to uh, the excellence

01:35:31.601 --> 01:35:33.978
that they demonstrated every day.

01:35:50.953 --> 01:35:52.788
It's amazing.

01:35:52.830 --> 01:35:56.876
I think it's amazing that we were
not only able to do it technically,

01:35:56.918 --> 01:35:58.794
but the country let us do it,

01:35:58.836 --> 01:36:03.633
the public and the congress and
the leadership and the White House.

01:36:03.675 --> 01:36:06.636
Everything collided and lined up correctly.

01:36:16.521 --> 01:36:19.524
I had the feeling of what it meant,

01:36:19.566 --> 01:36:21.401
you know, we're making history.

01:36:21.443 --> 01:36:23.528
I think all of us did.

01:36:23.570 --> 01:36:29.743
And realizing that, there was a sense of pride

01:36:23.570 --> 01:36:29.743
in what we're doing,

01:36:29.783 --> 01:36:34.830
and a great feeling of gratitude that
I happened to stumble into it at the right time.

01:36:36.249 --> 01:36:39.628
It was just a golden opportunity to be a part of it.

01:36:43.839 --> 01:36:46.800
Somehow or other, when we came together,

01:36:46.842 --> 01:36:49.803
we were greater than the sum of our parts.

01:36:52.014 --> 01:36:54.850
We became capable

01:36:54.892 --> 01:37:00.315
of doing what, in most cases,
would be considered impossible.

01:37:00.356 --> 01:37:03.443
We were better than we ever expected to be.

01:37:03.485 --> 01:37:06.488
We were more successful than we were expected to be.

01:37:06.529 --> 01:37:09.699
And really, with the exception of a bad accident

01:37:06.529 --> 01:37:09.699
on the launch pad,

01:37:09.741 --> 01:37:12.201
we brought every crewman home.

01:37:15.163 --> 01:37:16.623
We the astronauts,

01:37:16.665 --> 01:37:19.501
we were always the tip of the arrow,

01:37:19.542 --> 01:37:24.964
but Mission Control were sort of like the feathers.

01:37:25.006 --> 01:37:28.926
They pointed us in the right direction.

01:37:28.968 --> 01:37:32.930
They made sure we were gonna get
where we wanted to go

01:37:32.972 --> 01:37:36.559
and get home safely.

01:37:40.021 --> 01:37:43.941
I'm just proud of the people that were involved.

01:37:45.276 --> 01:37:47.278
They never let me down.

01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:49.739
They never let the system down,
they never let NASA down,

01:37:49.781 --> 01:37:51.741
they never let the country down.

01:37:51.783 --> 01:37:56.412
And if you're looking for patriots, they are they.

01:37:59.081 --> 01:38:00.458
Every one of them.
