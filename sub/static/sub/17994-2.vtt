00:45.962 --> 00:50.341
The frozen seas
are worlds unto themselves.

00:50.508 --> 00:53.178
Beneath their ceiling of ice,

00:53.344 --> 00:56.473
they have an eerie,
almost magical stillness,

00:56.639 --> 00:59.684
cut off from the storms
that rage above.

01:03.938 --> 01:08.318
In the winter, the feeble slanting
rays of the sun bring little warmth

01:08.485 --> 01:13.156
and the temperature seldom rises
above minus 50 degrees Centigrade.

01:13.323 --> 01:15.408
(HOWLING, WHISTLING WIND)

01:27.170 --> 01:31.132
For much of the year,
it is dark and cripplingly cold.

01:31.299 --> 01:34.719
Yet, there IS life here
at BOTH ends of the earth -

01:34.886 --> 01:38.348
the Arctic and the Antarctic.

01:48.399 --> 01:52.028
For most animals, whether
they live in or out of water,

01:52.195 --> 01:55.156
the winters,
when much of the sea is frozen,

01:55.323 --> 01:57.283
bring the greatest challenge.

02:01.246 --> 02:03.331
The northern hemisphere.

02:03.498 --> 02:05.041
It's February,

02:05.208 --> 02:07.543
and as the earth tilts on its axis,

02:07.710 --> 02:10.338
the sun's rays
creep slowly northwards

02:10.505 --> 02:13.549
and the Arctic emerges
from its harsh winter.

02:17.262 --> 02:21.099
The Arctic is a frozen ocean
surrounded by continents,

02:21.266 --> 02:24.686
and when the surface of the sea
between the continents

02:24.852 --> 02:26.688
freezes from shore to shore,

02:26.854 --> 02:29.357
land predators walk out onto it

02:29.524 --> 02:31.025
to hunt.

02:36.614 --> 02:38.700
It's early March,

02:38.866 --> 02:41.494
and the sea is still covered
with ice...

02:42.161 --> 02:45.289
But there are patches
of open water - polynyas -

02:45.456 --> 02:47.166
that never freeze over.

02:47.333 --> 02:51.754
Here, where tidal currents
are squeezed between islands,

02:51.921 --> 02:55.758
the water movement is so strong
that ice cannot form.

03:01.222 --> 03:04.350
Walruses spend the winter
in polynyas.

03:05.435 --> 03:08.312
Here they have permanent access
to the air,

03:08.479 --> 03:12.567
but they can also retreat
to the sea to shelter, to hunt.

03:26.330 --> 03:30.460
Other sea mammals overwinter
in polynyas as well - in this one,

03:30.626 --> 03:32.712
a young bowhead whale.

03:42.722 --> 03:44.891
Here, the current is really fast

03:45.057 --> 03:47.143
and the shifting ice is dangerous.

03:52.815 --> 03:54.901
This whale became trapped

03:55.067 --> 03:57.779
when ice encircled it last autumn.

04:04.994 --> 04:07.079
There is no food here,

04:07.246 --> 04:09.582
but a whale must breathe,

04:09.749 --> 04:14.837
and the only place it can do so
for miles around is in this tiny hole.

04:18.132 --> 04:21.093
It's living entirely
on its reserves of fat,

04:21.260 --> 04:23.763
but now, they're dangerously low.

04:23.930 --> 04:27.058
It will be some months yet
before it can escape.

04:41.280 --> 04:44.575
Elsewhere, other whales
have also been trapped.

04:44.742 --> 04:46.536
These are belugas.

04:46.702 --> 04:48.788
Their tiny hole in the ice

04:48.955 --> 04:51.290
has been kept open not by currents,

04:51.457 --> 04:54.293
but by the belugas'
continuous movements

04:54.460 --> 04:56.254
as they rise to breathe.

05:02.051 --> 05:05.221
Open water is now
some 20 miles away.

05:05.763 --> 05:09.016
It will be two months yet
before the ice melts.

05:21.487 --> 05:23.823
The belugas are extremely thin

05:23.990 --> 05:26.701
and most of them
are horribly scarred.

05:36.043 --> 05:39.380
But their wounds
were not inflicted by the ice.

05:48.931 --> 05:52.685
A whale would be a huge prize
for any meat-eating hunter,

05:52.852 --> 05:55.521
and these belugas,
trapped by the ice,

05:55.688 --> 05:57.815
are within reach of polar bears.

06:11.454 --> 06:13.497
Well aware of the danger,

06:13.664 --> 06:17.126
the belugas stay submerged
as long as they can,

06:17.293 --> 06:21.047
but they can only hold their breath
for about 20 minutes.

06:40.691 --> 06:44.528
Catching a four-metre-long whale
that weighs one tonne

06:44.695 --> 06:46.280
is no easy task,

06:46.447 --> 06:50.284
even if that whale
is weakened by starvation.

07:02.004 --> 07:05.549
But a beluga
is well worth waiting for.

07:29.573 --> 07:31.867
Day by day,
as the hole gets bigger,

07:32.034 --> 07:36.288
it becomes increasingly difficult
for the bear to land a whale.

07:40.125 --> 07:43.587
Keeping its fur in good condition
and free from salt

07:43.754 --> 07:45.631
is important for warmth,

07:45.798 --> 07:48.884
and the bear uses snow
like blotting paper.

08:00.771 --> 08:03.774
These belugas have been attacked
by many bears

08:03.941 --> 08:05.609
over the last six months,

08:05.776 --> 08:07.861
and some have been caught.

08:11.156 --> 08:14.451
It may have taken a long time
and a lot of patience,

08:14.618 --> 08:18.414
but a catch when it's made
brings abundant rewards

08:18.581 --> 08:20.374
of energy-rich blubber.

08:31.427 --> 08:35.097
Gulls rely on bear kills
at this time of the year,

08:35.264 --> 08:37.890
and the colour of blood
staining the ice

08:38.058 --> 08:40.394
attracts them from a long way away.

08:44.481 --> 08:47.443
The remaining belugas
still have a long wait

08:47.609 --> 08:50.487
before they're released
from their prison

08:50.654 --> 08:52.614
and the threat of slaughter.

09:21.268 --> 09:24.104
Arctic foxes
also rely on the polar bears

09:24.271 --> 09:26.273
to hunt on their behalf.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.817
They're the jackals of the north,

09:28.984 --> 09:32.488
and scavenge from bear kills
whenever they can.

09:40.996 --> 09:43.082
In winter and early spring,

09:43.248 --> 09:45.959
they're wholly dependent on bears.

09:46.126 --> 09:48.921
Only in the summer,
when the sea ice melts,

09:49.088 --> 09:52.299
will they regularly catch prey
for themselves.

09:59.598 --> 10:02.851
They're not strong enough
to tackle adult seals,

10:03.018 --> 10:06.688
but can certainly take
new-born pups or birds.

10:20.702 --> 10:22.412
This canny individual

10:22.579 --> 10:24.665
is going to bury its prize.

10:24.832 --> 10:28.043
It may need it
during the uncertain times ahead.

10:31.797 --> 10:33.549
The presence of bears

10:33.715 --> 10:38.303
affects the behaviour of almost all
the animals here, big and small.

10:38.470 --> 10:41.932
The bears tend to avoid
the fringe of fragmented ice

10:42.099 --> 10:43.892
bordering open water

10:44.059 --> 10:46.770
where travelling
can be very laborious,

10:46.937 --> 10:50.148
but that very fact
makes this area - the pack ice -

10:50.315 --> 10:52.276
a particularly good place

10:52.442 --> 10:54.361
for seals to pup.

11:03.078 --> 11:04.788
Harp seals breed here.

11:04.955 --> 11:07.374
Their pups are born with white coats

11:07.541 --> 11:11.461
which camouflage them
very effectively against the snow.

11:13.630 --> 11:16.592
Harp seals have
a very short nursing period -

11:16.758 --> 11:19.511
a necessity
on this unstable pack ice -

11:19.678 --> 11:22.556
but suckling is intensive.

11:22.723 --> 11:25.559
The pup feeds for just 12 days

11:25.726 --> 11:27.978
on milk that is 45 per cent fat.

11:28.145 --> 11:30.772
Then it's abandoned

11:30.939 --> 11:33.025
and has to fend for itself.

11:36.445 --> 11:37.988
A male hooded seal.

11:42.868 --> 11:44.953
This impressive nasal display

11:45.120 --> 11:48.206
is used to warn away other males...

11:54.880 --> 11:56.340
and to win a mate.

11:57.382 --> 11:59.801
Hooded seals also breed
on pack ice.

12:00.052 --> 12:02.554
Their pups suckle
for only four days,

12:02.721 --> 12:06.099
the shortest nursing period
known for any mammal,

12:06.266 --> 12:09.770
and all because
the threat of polar bears

12:09.936 --> 12:12.981
caused them to breed
on the unstable ice.

12:28.955 --> 12:33.418
Another Arctic seal opts
for the solid ice further north.

12:34.336 --> 12:37.047
Because it's easy for bears
to hunt here,

12:37.214 --> 12:40.592
these ringed seals
must be particularly vigilant

12:40.759 --> 12:42.844
and have to hide their pups.

12:46.848 --> 12:49.476
Ringed seals
are comparatively small,

12:49.643 --> 12:51.978
so they can give birth
to their pups

12:52.145 --> 12:54.773
in little caves or lairs
under the snow.

12:55.690 --> 12:57.526
Here, a pup is out of sight

12:57.692 --> 12:59.861
and protected from bad weather.

13:04.449 --> 13:06.535
In late March and into April,

13:06.701 --> 13:10.747
female bears emerge from
winter dens with their new cubs.

13:12.999 --> 13:16.211
The mother has not eaten
for at least five months

13:16.378 --> 13:18.588
and she's hungry - very hungry.

13:26.721 --> 13:30.684
If she doesn't succeed in catching
a regular supply of seals,

13:30.851 --> 13:32.310
her milk will fail

13:32.477 --> 13:34.271
and her cub will die.

13:40.694 --> 13:44.447
Bears have an extraordinarily
sensitive sense of smell

13:44.614 --> 13:47.534
and can detect seal pups
hidden in the snow

13:47.701 --> 13:49.661
from two kilometres away.

14:02.048 --> 14:05.427
But a female ringed seal
uses several lairs

14:05.594 --> 14:08.305
and a bear will have
to break into a number

14:08.471 --> 14:11.641
before it finds one
that is occupied.

14:21.234 --> 14:23.486
This is a crucial time for the cub.

14:23.653 --> 14:25.739
By watching its mother hunt

14:25.906 --> 14:30.493
and by copying her actions, it's
beginning to acquire the rudiments

14:30.660 --> 14:32.746
of its own hunting skills.

14:37.083 --> 14:40.211
Play is also important
for developing muscles

14:40.378 --> 14:42.380
and improving co-ordination.

15:02.734 --> 15:04.277
As the days go by,

15:04.444 --> 15:08.531
the sun rises higher and remains
above the horizon even at night.

15:17.874 --> 15:20.669
The female bear continues to hunt

15:20.835 --> 15:23.922
until her cub is too tired
and can't keep up.

15:29.803 --> 15:31.680
She's smelt something.

15:55.453 --> 15:58.581
The pup escapes
through a hole in its lair

15:58.748 --> 16:00.834
that leads to the sea below.

16:24.941 --> 16:27.902
Only one in 20 hunts is successful,

16:28.194 --> 16:30.822
but this mother
must find a seal pup soon

16:30.989 --> 16:33.616
if her cub is not
to starve to death.

16:51.217 --> 16:56.222
As spring turns into summer, the sun's
heat begins to melt the sea ice.

17:00.602 --> 17:02.562
Now, the ocean is accessible

17:02.729 --> 17:05.815
and the Arctic's summer visitors
return.

17:05.982 --> 17:07.483
Migrating birds

17:07.650 --> 17:09.234
arrive from the south

17:09.402 --> 17:13.114
to nest and feed on the seafood
now within their reach.

17:13.281 --> 17:14.907
Brunnich's guillemots

17:15.074 --> 17:17.868
are the northern equivalent
of penguins,

17:18.036 --> 17:20.829
but they have retained
the power of flight

17:20.997 --> 17:23.665
for they need to reach cliff ledges

17:23.833 --> 17:28.003
where their nests will be safe
from predatory bears and foxes.

17:45.104 --> 17:49.192
Nonetheless, they are as at home
in the water as in the air.

17:50.985 --> 17:53.905
They dive down
to a depth of 50 metres or more

17:54.072 --> 17:55.573
to catch fish.

18:05.124 --> 18:07.752
In June, the ice begins to fracture.

18:07.919 --> 18:10.004
The cracks - or leads -

18:10.171 --> 18:12.590
form useful corridors of open water

18:12.757 --> 18:14.842
for air-breathing animals.

18:19.055 --> 18:22.183
Belugas, migrating
to their feeding grounds,

18:22.350 --> 18:26.521
use these leads to penetrate
the ice-covered seas and reach areas

18:26.688 --> 18:30.858
where their preferred food,
Arctic cod, has spent the winter.

18:37.865 --> 18:42.787
The males regularly dive
to about 500 metres to find fish.

18:43.079 --> 18:46.666
The females and young,
which have smaller lungs,

18:46.833 --> 18:49.460
only go to about 350.

19:01.848 --> 19:05.601
In late June and July,
narwhals arrive.

19:07.270 --> 19:10.189
The females,
who usually lack tusks,

19:10.356 --> 19:12.608
come first with their new calves.

19:12.775 --> 19:14.902
The males follow a little later.

19:28.875 --> 19:31.169
They also move up the leads

19:31.335 --> 19:33.754
in search of fresh feeding grounds.

19:45.850 --> 19:48.269
Bowheads. Up to 18 metres long

19:48.436 --> 19:50.480
and weighing 100 tonnes.

19:51.397 --> 19:53.483
These are the only large whales

19:53.649 --> 19:56.194
that stay in the Arctic
all year round.

20:12.752 --> 20:14.545
They are not after fish.

20:14.712 --> 20:17.131
They're seeking smaller prey.

20:18.382 --> 20:22.220
Despite having the largest mouths
in the animal kingdom -

20:22.386 --> 20:24.472
the size of a small garage -

20:24.639 --> 20:27.183
they eat tiny crustaceans -
copepods -

20:27.725 --> 20:29.810
straining them from the water

20:29.977 --> 20:32.772
with the four-metre-long strips
of baleen

20:32.939 --> 20:35.107
that hang from their upper jaws.

20:43.699 --> 20:46.327
In the summer,
they store enough energy

20:46.494 --> 20:49.288
to last them
through the following winter

20:49.455 --> 20:51.624
when food will be less abundant.

20:54.126 --> 20:55.920
As the ice melts away,

20:56.087 --> 20:58.965
the polar bears are forced
to head for land.

21:01.509 --> 21:03.594
They are excellent swimmers,

21:03.761 --> 21:08.099
and can cover 100 miles
of continuous open water if need be.

21:45.428 --> 21:47.513
Off east Greenland,

21:47.680 --> 21:51.392
there is little ice left by August,
so walruses haul out

21:51.559 --> 21:53.352
to rest on land.

21:53.519 --> 21:56.021
At this time of year,
they are moulting,

21:56.188 --> 22:00.276
getting rid of their old,
scarred, parasite-ridden skin.

22:11.162 --> 22:15.291
A bathe in cold water brings
some relief from the itching...

22:34.268 --> 22:36.353
but even there,

22:36.520 --> 22:39.190
the odd scratch is irresistible.

22:58.751 --> 23:02.338
They make daily excursions
out to deeper water.

23:12.890 --> 23:14.475
Down at 20 metres,

23:14.642 --> 23:16.894
they root around in the sediment,

23:17.061 --> 23:19.230
using their sensitive bristles

23:19.396 --> 23:21.732
to search out soft-shelled clams.

23:41.502 --> 23:43.379
Once they find a clam,

23:43.545 --> 23:45.798
they suck its flesh from the shell

23:45.965 --> 23:48.592
with their powerful,
muscular mouths.

23:51.971 --> 23:55.474
Walruses can feed for
about five minutes at this depth

23:55.641 --> 23:59.186
before they have to return
to the surface to breathe.

24:06.819 --> 24:11.323
Elsewhere in the Arctic, belugas are
gathering in their thousands.

24:11.490 --> 24:15.202
They congregate
in just a few large estuaries.

24:17.997 --> 24:21.125
Belugas of all ages and sizes
come here.

24:21.625 --> 24:23.794
There are even young calves.

24:36.098 --> 24:37.683
Some are so young -

24:37.850 --> 24:39.935
born only a week or so ago -

24:40.102 --> 24:41.770
that they need help.

24:41.937 --> 24:44.189
They swim on their mothers' backs

24:44.356 --> 24:46.859
so that they can breathe
more easily.

24:57.995 --> 25:00.330
As the tide moves up the estuary,

25:00.497 --> 25:02.082
the belugas follow,

25:02.249 --> 25:05.210
swimming into surprisingly
shallow water.

25:12.676 --> 25:14.219
Like walruses,

25:14.386 --> 25:16.346
they also need to moult.

25:24.730 --> 25:27.065
A combination of warm fresh water

25:27.232 --> 25:31.195
and vigorous rubbing
against the gravel does the trick.

25:42.831 --> 25:44.708
They remain here for days

25:44.875 --> 25:46.418
or even weeks,

25:46.585 --> 25:49.087
so it's likely that socialising

25:49.254 --> 25:51.381
is also important to them.

25:57.471 --> 26:01.350
After moulting,
they head back out to sea to feed.

26:07.481 --> 26:09.066
It's now autumn,

26:09.233 --> 26:12.402
and the sea begins
to freeze over once again.

26:18.325 --> 26:20.911
Thin sheets of ice form
at the surface

26:21.078 --> 26:23.038
and pile up, layer upon layer,

26:23.205 --> 26:26.333
gradually creating
an impenetrable barrier.

26:35.008 --> 26:40.889
By late November, the Arctic ocean
is sealed once again by ice.

26:55.654 --> 26:57.781
The lights of the aurora

26:57.948 --> 26:59.992
play in the winter sky.

27:11.044 --> 27:14.506
And at the other end
of the planet - in the Antarctic -

27:14.673 --> 27:16.758
there is the southern aurora.

27:32.858 --> 27:35.569
Antarctica is now
emerging from winter.

27:36.486 --> 27:39.781
This is the coldest,
windiest place in the world.

27:39.948 --> 27:43.952
Temperatures are still hovering
at a numbing minus 50,

27:44.119 --> 27:47.247
and the returning sun
has virtually no warmth.

27:48.040 --> 27:52.294
Very few animals can survive
such extreme conditions...

27:53.837 --> 27:56.923
but Emperor penguins can.

27:57.090 --> 27:59.176
(HOWLING, ROARING WIND)

28:02.929 --> 28:05.015
Standing on the frozen sea,

28:05.182 --> 28:08.643
they endure the full force
of the Antarctic storms.

28:18.028 --> 28:20.155
Only by huddling together

28:20.322 --> 28:23.742
can they survive
the appalling winter months.

28:29.790 --> 28:34.044
They take it in turns
to bear the brunt of the gales.

28:36.046 --> 28:38.131
They can only live here at all

28:38.298 --> 28:42.469
because Antarctica is surrounded
by the great Southern Ocean

28:42.636 --> 28:45.680
and no land predators
have been able to reach it,

28:45.847 --> 28:47.933
so, unlike Arctic animals,

28:48.099 --> 28:50.811
they're not threatened
by polar bears.

28:54.314 --> 28:56.107
The sea is still frozen,

28:56.274 --> 28:59.653
but one seal, nonetheless,
manages to stay here,

28:59.861 --> 29:03.198
even throughout the winter -

29:06.409 --> 29:08.036
the Weddell seal.

29:23.093 --> 29:26.972
Underwater, it's protected
from the storms above,

29:27.138 --> 29:29.850
but it must have access
to the air all year

29:30.016 --> 29:31.977
in order to breathe.

29:43.321 --> 29:46.449
And they keep
their breathing holes open

29:46.616 --> 29:48.285
with their teeth.

29:58.962 --> 30:01.923
Only by continually
scraping away at the ice

30:02.090 --> 30:04.551
can they maintain access
to the air,

30:04.718 --> 30:08.179
but that means that their teeth
get badly worn down.

30:08.513 --> 30:12.058
Then, they can no longer hunt
and eat effectively.

30:12.225 --> 30:14.894
Weddell seals die young.

30:23.945 --> 30:26.323
The continent of Antarctica

30:26.489 --> 30:28.575
is so isolated and so high -

30:28.742 --> 30:31.328
almost 5,000 metres in places -

30:31.494 --> 30:34.706
that it's considerably colder
than the Arctic.

30:37.542 --> 30:41.004
Ice slides slowly down
from its centre

30:41.171 --> 30:43.673
towards its rim
in immense glaciers.

30:46.301 --> 30:50.388
During winter, the continent
effectively doubles in size

30:50.555 --> 30:52.223
as the sea freezes over.

30:52.390 --> 30:55.101
Ice forms around its shores

30:55.268 --> 30:58.146
and extends outwards
for hundreds of miles

30:58.313 --> 31:00.398
around the entire land mass.

31:06.279 --> 31:10.367
Under the sea ice live small
shrimp-like creatures - krill.

31:10.533 --> 31:13.620
They have been here all winter.

31:15.914 --> 31:18.208
During these dark months,

31:18.374 --> 31:21.419
they feed by scraping algae
from the ice.

31:24.255 --> 31:26.758
Remarkably, they also shrink in size

31:26.925 --> 31:30.220
and revert to their juvenile form
to save energy.

31:37.727 --> 31:40.396
As the temperature rises in spring,

31:40.563 --> 31:42.398
the ice begins to melt,

31:42.565 --> 31:46.111
and little air bubbles
trapped within it are released.

31:46.277 --> 31:49.197
Microscopic algae grow
around these bubbles

31:49.364 --> 31:51.449
and the krill now graze on them,

31:51.616 --> 31:54.577
gathering them up
with their beating legs.

32:11.636 --> 32:13.721
As the sun's rays grow stronger

32:13.888 --> 32:16.558
and penetrate deeper
into the water,

32:16.724 --> 32:19.143
floating algae begin to flourish,

32:20.228 --> 32:22.480
and krill leave the dwindling ice

32:22.897 --> 32:24.774
and gather in swarms

32:24.941 --> 32:27.026
as they harvest this new crop.

32:37.203 --> 32:38.746
Far to the north,

32:38.913 --> 32:40.999
beyond the blanket of sea ice,

32:41.165 --> 32:42.750
chinstrap penguins

32:42.917 --> 32:45.879
have been overwintering
in the open ocean.

32:53.344 --> 32:55.430
The occasional iceberg

32:55.597 --> 32:57.765
gives them the chance of a rest -

32:57.932 --> 33:00.018
if they can get onto it.

33:29.756 --> 33:33.134
But at this time of year,
where they really want to be

33:33.301 --> 33:34.761
is on land.

33:34.927 --> 33:38.514
It's just getting there
that's tricky.

33:56.908 --> 34:00.912
It's spring, and the penguins
are returning to breed.

34:07.877 --> 34:11.672
Their need to get ashore
is now urgent and imperative.

34:25.311 --> 34:27.980
Doing so is all a matter of timing,

34:28.147 --> 34:30.233
and picking the right wave.

35:19.240 --> 35:21.784
But their journey
has only just begun.

35:22.368 --> 35:24.996
Most of them will have to walk
many miles

35:25.163 --> 35:27.498
before they can find a nest site.

35:36.924 --> 35:39.427
(TREMENDOUS DIN)

35:43.139 --> 35:45.349
This is Zavodovski Island,

35:45.516 --> 35:48.895
which has the largest
penguin colony in the world.

35:50.229 --> 35:53.024
About two million chinstraps
breed here,

35:53.190 --> 35:56.444
and they come to THIS island
for a good reason.

36:02.241 --> 36:04.327
It's an active volcano.

36:04.493 --> 36:07.788
The heat from the crater
and the fumeroles

36:07.955 --> 36:10.833
keeps the slopes
free from the ice and snow,

36:11.000 --> 36:14.754
allowing these chinstraps
to start breeding earlier

36:14.921 --> 36:16.797
than those further south.

36:19.508 --> 36:21.052
But then again,

36:21.218 --> 36:25.097
living on an active volcano
is not without its risks.

36:26.974 --> 36:28.559
Unlike the Emperors,

36:28.726 --> 36:32.521
these penguins are able to lay
their eggs on the bare ground.

36:32.688 --> 36:36.651
Little wonder so many choose
to brave the mountainous waves

36:36.817 --> 36:38.361
in order to get here.

36:45.201 --> 36:47.620
Further south, near the continent,

36:47.787 --> 36:50.915
the blanket of sea ice
is beginning to break up.

36:55.836 --> 36:58.464
Icebergs are gigantic fragments
of ice

36:58.631 --> 37:02.718
that have broken away into the sea
from the front of glaciers.

37:02.885 --> 37:06.430
During the winter,
they were frozen into the sea ice,

37:06.597 --> 37:08.974
but now they're set adrift
once more.

37:48.556 --> 37:50.307
As the bergs break up,

37:50.474 --> 37:52.476
they form brash ice.

37:53.477 --> 37:57.189
It litters the backwaters
of the Antarctic peninsula.

38:17.293 --> 38:21.881
Minke whales make their way
into these placid waters in summer.

38:22.047 --> 38:25.801
This is the most abundant whale
in the Southern Ocean.

38:37.479 --> 38:41.525
Minkes are one of the smallest
of all the baleen whales,

38:41.692 --> 38:44.737
and like all others,
they come here to feed.

38:58.167 --> 39:00.252
The majestic humpback whales

39:00.419 --> 39:02.296
are also summer visitors.

39:11.347 --> 39:13.891
They have travelled
thousands of miles

39:14.058 --> 39:17.436
from their winter breeding grounds
in the tropics

39:17.603 --> 39:21.440
to gather the food that becomes
available here in summer.

39:37.247 --> 39:38.916
In just four months,

39:39.083 --> 39:41.168
they accumulate enough fat

39:41.335 --> 39:45.464
to provide them with energy for
the whole of the rest of the year.

40:03.732 --> 40:07.444
All these animals have come here
in search of one thing -

40:07.611 --> 40:09.154
the krill.

40:10.364 --> 40:12.449
Krill is the mainstay

40:12.616 --> 40:14.702
of the Antarctic food web.

40:22.960 --> 40:25.254
It occurs in phenomenal quantity -

40:25.421 --> 40:28.382
billions of individuals
in a single swarm,

40:28.924 --> 40:31.260
and swarms can stretch for miles.

40:36.557 --> 40:40.978
Fur seals also collect
this rich, super-abundant food.

40:42.020 --> 40:44.106
Krill swarms are very patchy,

40:44.273 --> 40:45.816
but once found,

40:45.983 --> 40:47.526
feeding is easy.

41:14.928 --> 41:19.016
Humpbacks engulf
hundreds of thousands of them

41:19.183 --> 41:21.768
in a single gargantuan mouthful.

41:33.739 --> 41:35.282
When the going is good,

41:35.449 --> 41:37.409
the whales feed continuously,

41:37.576 --> 41:40.078
each eating
up to two tonnes of krill

41:40.245 --> 41:41.872
in 24 hours.

41:46.210 --> 41:49.880
Further south, near the continent,
the sea ice is still sound.

41:50.047 --> 41:53.425
Here, where the ice remains
for most of the summer,

41:53.592 --> 41:55.928
Emperor penguins make their home.

41:57.095 --> 41:59.681
These have been feeding out at sea,

41:59.848 --> 42:03.310
and are now ready to make
their way back to the colony

42:03.477 --> 42:05.187
to feed their chicks.

42:07.439 --> 42:11.109
Instead of heading
straight for the ice edge,

42:11.276 --> 42:14.321
the penguins hesitate
some distance from it.

42:15.197 --> 42:16.740
They're nervous.

42:29.294 --> 42:30.879
They dive down

42:31.046 --> 42:33.674
and investigate the ice edge...

42:48.814 --> 42:50.565
And for good reason.

42:50.732 --> 42:53.735
Leopard seals patrol this border.

43:02.160 --> 43:06.790
Leopard seals are the Antarctic's
equivalent of polar bears.

43:06.957 --> 43:08.834
They're the top predators,

43:09.001 --> 43:12.045
but they hunt most successfully
in the water,

43:12.212 --> 43:13.797
so by and large,

43:13.964 --> 43:17.175
the animals they prey on
are safer out on the ice.

43:24.266 --> 43:28.979
They have a lazy grace
that belies their ferocious nature.

43:43.744 --> 43:46.079
Confident that the coast is clear,

43:46.246 --> 43:48.957
the Emperor penguins
head for the ice...

43:51.042 --> 43:53.295
but they certainly don't linger.

44:35.253 --> 44:39.466
Now they have a long walk back
to the colony.

44:44.554 --> 44:48.642
Emperor penguin colonies are
some way back from the ice edge.

44:49.518 --> 44:53.146
In winter, they may be
as much as 100 miles from it,

44:53.313 --> 44:56.441
but as the summer progresses
and the ice melts,

44:56.608 --> 44:59.319
the edge comes ever closer
to the colony.

44:59.486 --> 45:02.072
So by the time the chicks
are fledged

45:02.239 --> 45:04.574
and ready to take their first swim,

45:04.741 --> 45:06.284
the water is close by.

45:14.626 --> 45:17.712
This colony is in the lee
of a headland,

45:17.879 --> 45:20.924
and that prevents the ice
from being broken up

45:21.091 --> 45:22.717
by ocean currents.

45:23.218 --> 45:25.887
The returning adults
are so full of food

45:26.054 --> 45:27.847
that they can barely walk,

45:28.014 --> 45:30.850
but with no predator
to threaten them now,

45:31.017 --> 45:33.103
they can take their time.

45:42.404 --> 45:46.449
Somehow, in this mÃªlÃ©e
of 60,000 or so penguins,

45:46.616 --> 45:48.910
a parent has to find its chick.

45:59.337 --> 46:02.757
It returns to the place
where it last left its chick

46:02.924 --> 46:05.927
in the hope
that it might still be close by...

46:08.471 --> 46:11.099
but chicks tend to wander,

46:11.266 --> 46:13.810
so the adult has to call to it.

46:16.396 --> 46:19.024
(ADULT MAKES LOW TRILLING CALL)

46:22.318 --> 46:24.571
(CHICK MAKES HIGH-PITCHED PEEP)

46:28.700 --> 46:30.285
The chick responds,

46:30.452 --> 46:32.871
and they slowly
home in on one another.

46:33.038 --> 46:35.540
The plaintive entreaties
of the chick

46:35.707 --> 46:39.544
stimulates the adult
to regurgitate a mouthful of fish.

46:50.555 --> 46:52.640
With the return of one parent,

46:52.807 --> 46:55.852
the other is free to go to sea
to feed for itself.

47:11.701 --> 47:14.204
Aware of the leopard seal's
presence,

47:14.370 --> 47:17.582
the penguins press together
at the ice edge

47:17.749 --> 47:21.002
unwilling to be the first
to risk diving in.

47:37.310 --> 47:40.480
Occasionally,
the seal comes out onto the ice

47:40.647 --> 47:42.732
and attempts to grab one...

47:58.164 --> 48:01.376
But its most successful strategy
by far

48:01.543 --> 48:03.086
is to lie in wait.

48:10.885 --> 48:13.429
It hides behind a corner of ice.

48:16.516 --> 48:18.601
The Emperors gain confidence

48:18.768 --> 48:20.353
and make a dash for it.

48:32.657 --> 48:35.368
The first wave of penguins escape.

48:38.204 --> 48:40.707
Once in open water,
they will be safe.

48:45.878 --> 48:48.214
But the seal is alerted
by the noise,

48:48.381 --> 48:51.759
and through the mass of bubbles,
it makes its attack.

49:02.812 --> 49:05.773
Almost invariably, it makes a kill.

49:13.406 --> 49:15.950
Encouraged by the absence
of the seal,

49:16.117 --> 49:19.746
the remaining penguins
make a break for the open sea.

49:39.974 --> 49:42.351
In time, their chicks will fledge,

49:42.518 --> 49:45.563
and when the Antarctic autumn
is near its end,

49:45.730 --> 49:49.108
these adults will walk
across the newly-formed ice

49:49.275 --> 49:51.360
to endure yet another winter

49:51.527 --> 49:53.863
on the frozen sea.
