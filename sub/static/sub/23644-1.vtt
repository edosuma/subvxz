WEBVTT

00:10.310 --> 00:11.576
This is bad.

00:11.578 --> 00:14.312
Something just hurt me.

00:14.314 --> 00:17.216
I gotta get out of here,
I gotta get out of here.

00:17.218 --> 00:19.184
We are being
physically attacked.

00:19.186 --> 00:21.186
I had a shadow figure
hold me down in bed.

00:22.889 --> 00:24.823
There's some kind
of demonic thing.

00:24.825 --> 00:26.191
I don't know if
it's a demon or not,

00:26.193 --> 00:27.893
but it sure as hell
looks like one.

00:29.397 --> 00:31.563
- Is she possessed?
- Yeah.

00:31.565 --> 00:33.098
My God.

00:33.100 --> 00:35.868
These evil little things
are in here.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.571
Panic, panic, panic.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.473
My name is Amy Allan.

00:41.475 --> 00:43.275
I'm seeing, like, blood.

00:43.277 --> 00:46.612
The house just feels <i> bad.</i>

00:46.614 --> 00:47.880
I see dead people.

00:47.882 --> 00:52.251
This man
is <i> completely</i> insane.

00:52.253 --> 00:55.421
I speak to dead people...

00:55.423 --> 00:57.589
Whoo. Okay.
She doesn't like it in there.

00:57.591 --> 00:59.591
...and they speak to me.

00:59.593 --> 01:01.627
He likes to twist that knife.

01:01.629 --> 01:05.129
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

01:05.132 --> 01:08.767
Something paranormal
is trying to kill them.

01:08.769 --> 01:10.368
I rely on my partner.

01:10.370 --> 01:11.870
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:11.872 --> 01:14.206
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:14.208 --> 01:15.908
Now does he die right there,
on the spot?

01:15.910 --> 01:19.778
I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:19.780 --> 01:22.381
I think it's trying
to steal my soul.

01:22.383 --> 01:24.249
It's my job to reveal them.

01:24.251 --> 01:26.552
You ever get touched
like that again?

01:26.554 --> 01:28.454
But Steve and I never speak...

01:28.456 --> 01:30.522
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:30.524 --> 01:31.857
...until the very end.

01:31.859 --> 01:34.092
I'm as stunned as you guys are.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.928
When we uncover if
it's safe for you to stay...

01:35.930 --> 01:38.597
I don't want anything
to happen to my daughter.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.032
Or time to get out.

01:40.034 --> 01:43.368
His goal
is to kill you guys.

01:45.000 --> 01:51.074

01:55.683 --> 01:57.148
I'm in Mahwah, New Jersey.

01:57.150 --> 02:00.385
It's a suburb about 45 minutes
northwest of New York City.

02:00.387 --> 02:03.989
I got a call from a mother
named Jen. Sounded really bad.

02:03.991 --> 02:05.357
She says something in her house

02:05.359 --> 02:07.626
is attacking her
and her four kids.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.026
And if Amy and I can't help,

02:09.029 --> 02:11.029
somebody's gonna
get seriously hurt.

02:14.834 --> 02:16.969
Before Amy arrives,
I sweep the house

02:16.971 --> 02:19.037
for any leading information.

02:20.374 --> 02:23.041
Family photographs
and religious symbols

02:23.043 --> 02:24.843
can influence her findings,

02:24.845 --> 02:27.346
so it's important I cover
or remove them all.

02:29.850 --> 02:31.383
When I'm done,

02:31.385 --> 02:34.052
the location will be ready
for tonight's walk.

02:45.465 --> 02:47.966
This place is not good.

02:51.138 --> 02:54.139
I'm just getting feelings
in here, like, emotions.

02:54.141 --> 02:57.709
Unsettled, nervous,
worried, stress.

02:59.046 --> 03:01.079
Like, I'm hearing like,
"Get away from me.

03:01.081 --> 03:02.747
Like, "get away, get away,
get away."

03:02.749 --> 03:06.018
This is really bad. I wanna
run away. I don't like this.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.230
Well, Jen,
I'm glad I'm here,

03:19.232 --> 03:20.499
'cause when we spoke
on the phone,

03:20.501 --> 03:22.267
you sounded pretty upset.
The hell's going on here?

03:22.269 --> 03:24.236
I feel like
I'm living in hell.

03:24.238 --> 03:26.638
The activity is
aggressive in this house,

03:26.640 --> 03:29.641
and it's going after
me and my kids.

03:29.643 --> 03:32.777
Afraid, you know, something's
gonna happen to one of us.

03:32.779 --> 03:35.380
And I can't do that as a mother.
I need your help.

03:35.382 --> 03:37.516
Well, that's why
I'm here, honey.
I know.

03:38.852 --> 03:40.652
So, Jen, who exactly
lives in the house?

03:40.654 --> 03:43.187
My husband Gary
and my four kids.

03:43.189 --> 03:45.289
This is Joe. He's 15.

03:45.291 --> 03:48.193
These are my twins,
Ryan and Michael. They're 13.

03:48.195 --> 03:49.461
Okay.

03:49.463 --> 03:51.263
And this is my daughter
Samantha, and she's 6.

03:51.265 --> 03:53.398
Jen, do me a favor.
Give me a -- gimme a list

03:53.400 --> 03:55.100
of what you guys
are experiencing here.

03:55.102 --> 03:58.070
Hearing disembodied voices.

03:58.072 --> 04:01.172
There's been
a lot of shadow figures.

04:01.174 --> 04:04.109
Objects moving on their own.

04:04.111 --> 04:07.345
The health of the family
is declining.

04:07.347 --> 04:09.948
We are being
physically attacked.

04:09.950 --> 04:13.151
Okay. So now, Jen, is everybody
being affected by this?

04:13.153 --> 04:15.820
Yeah, but Joseph is getting
the brunt of it.

04:15.822 --> 04:18.156
- In what way?
- He's lashing out.

04:18.158 --> 04:20.825
He's doing things that are not
in character for him.

04:20.827 --> 04:23.161
It's not
normal teenage stuff.

04:23.163 --> 04:24.896
Well, what do you think
is here, honey?

04:24.898 --> 04:27.832
I believe there's some kind
of hold or possession on him.

04:27.834 --> 04:29.234
What do you think it wants?

04:29.236 --> 04:30.736
I'm afraid it wants
to kill him.

04:32.539 --> 04:34.840
You got a lot on your shoulders
as a mom to begin with.

04:34.842 --> 04:36.574
How are dealing with
all this other stuff?

04:36.576 --> 04:39.444
I have horrible anxiety.

04:39.446 --> 04:42.080
And I just can't
protect my kids.

04:42.082 --> 04:43.715
Samantha's only 6.

04:45.051 --> 04:47.985
And she --
she's a baby still.

04:47.987 --> 04:49.254
I don't wanna live
like this anymore.

04:51.959 --> 04:54.192
I'm seeing a male out here.

04:54.194 --> 04:56.728
And this person
is, like, confused

04:56.730 --> 04:59.731
and, like, scared,
pacing or running.

05:04.405 --> 05:07.205
The dude from outside
comes in here.

05:07.207 --> 05:09.074
And he's running
and he's running.

05:10.477 --> 05:11.843
Boom, and then he's in here.

05:13.047 --> 05:15.280
Also, he makes the living
feel anxious

05:15.282 --> 05:17.516
and it almost makes you
wanna throw up.

05:17.518 --> 05:19.084
Just utter despair.

05:19.086 --> 05:22.353
And your stomach drops out
and you wanna vomit.

05:22.355 --> 05:24.822
Definitely getting the chills
with him.

05:24.824 --> 05:27.726
He affects electrical stuff.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.328
He has too much energy.

05:30.397 --> 05:32.029
How would the living
perceive this?

05:32.031 --> 05:34.766
People do see
a dark shadow moving by.

05:34.768 --> 05:37.703
He's just a shadow person
down here.

05:45.612 --> 05:47.445
Okay, Jen, so what's
going on in this room?

05:47.447 --> 05:50.515
Constantly,
we see shadow figures

05:50.517 --> 05:52.484
coming down the stairs.

05:52.486 --> 05:55.387
I could be in bed and see them
from my bedroom, too.

05:55.389 --> 05:58.390
So is this the only spot that
you see the shadow figures?

05:58.392 --> 06:00.926
No, I see them
all over the house.

06:00.928 --> 06:05.163
I see shadow figures
outside behind the fence.

06:05.165 --> 06:07.332
This one is completely tall.

06:07.334 --> 06:09.734
It's like he has got,
like, an overcoat on.

06:09.736 --> 06:12.537
I think that this guy
is no good.

06:12.539 --> 06:15.207
Okay.
Anything else strange happen?

06:15.209 --> 06:17.375
On top of the stairs,
all the sudden,

06:17.377 --> 06:19.744
I felt a hand on my back
and I got pushed,

06:19.746 --> 06:22.580
and, like, it was gonna, like,
throw me down the stairs.

06:22.582 --> 06:24.750
So how hard did you get pushed?
Just gimme an idea.

06:24.752 --> 06:26.417
I mean, like this.

06:26.419 --> 06:29.087
Okay, you're getting shoved,
and you have a 6-year-old.

06:29.089 --> 06:30.822
Who's to say that
can't happen to her?

06:30.824 --> 06:33.158
That's my concern.
He wants to hurt us.

06:36.196 --> 06:39.164
This guy's energy
is so bad.

06:39.166 --> 06:40.999
Like, I don't even wanna
go down the stairs right now

06:41.001 --> 06:45.537
'cause little...
a little loopy.

06:47.040 --> 06:49.841
I'm not feeling very well
right now.

06:49.843 --> 06:54.745
I think that dude from outside
is making me feel sick.

06:54.747 --> 06:56.248
I feel drained.

06:56.250 --> 06:58.550
I feel nauseous.

06:58.552 --> 07:00.118
I feel very dizzy.

07:01.855 --> 07:05.223
I would be worried about
the living accidentally falling.

07:07.060 --> 07:10.061
He is doing things

07:10.063 --> 07:11.863
because he's angry.

07:11.865 --> 07:14.065
Any idea what kind of affect
he might have on the living?

07:14.067 --> 07:15.934
I think that
they would feel a drain.

07:15.936 --> 07:19.371
I think they would feel, like,
sudden exhaustion.

07:19.373 --> 07:22.073
I think that
they feel uncomfortable.

07:22.075 --> 07:24.209
I think, panicked.

07:31.752 --> 07:33.151
So what's going on in here?

07:33.153 --> 07:37.555
I think whatever is in this
house is draining my energy.

07:37.557 --> 07:39.724
- Okay.
- I can't sleep at night.

07:39.726 --> 07:41.726
And then I can't wake up
in the morning.

07:41.728 --> 07:43.294
All right, anything else
like that?

07:43.296 --> 07:46.131
My health is declining.
I'm sore.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.032
I get fevers on and off.

07:48.034 --> 07:51.303
Everything in my body,
every muscle, everything.

07:51.305 --> 07:52.970
So what makes you think
this is paranormal?

07:52.972 --> 07:54.706
Medically, they can't
find anything wrong.

07:54.708 --> 07:55.907
All right, anything else?

07:55.909 --> 07:58.676
There's mood changes,
me and my husband.

07:58.678 --> 08:02.914
He seems to be
more of a nasty, mad,

08:02.916 --> 08:06.651
taking out aggression
and things like that.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.987
When I'm here,
I'm not normal either.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.689
You know,
we fight constantly.

08:10.691 --> 08:11.756
Well, I gotta
be honest with you.

08:11.758 --> 08:12.991
I gotta play
devil's advocate here.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.927
- I mean, couples fight.
- It's not normal fights.

08:15.929 --> 08:17.128
We're like soul mates.

08:17.130 --> 08:19.130
We've been through
a lot of things together.

08:19.132 --> 08:21.066
This should not
break us up.

08:21.068 --> 08:22.767
I'm afraid to even ask.
Anything else?

08:22.769 --> 08:25.403
I've been bruised
in the middle of the night.

08:25.405 --> 08:27.939
I wake up with them.
It just makes no sense.

08:27.941 --> 08:29.207
So what kinda bruises
we talking about?

08:29.209 --> 08:31.209
Like three fingerprints?

08:31.211 --> 08:32.943
How do you know your husband's
not rolling over

08:32.946 --> 08:34.212
and banging into you?

08:34.214 --> 08:37.249
Well, he sleeps like a rock,
and there's no way.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.155
So I'm seeing
this older woman,

08:44.157 --> 08:46.691
and she's, like,
hurting living people.

08:48.295 --> 08:52.764
I'm seeing that older woman
trying to strangle somebody.

08:56.202 --> 09:00.371
The living here are absolutely
experiencing a lot of pain.

09:00.373 --> 09:03.908
She died from an infection
or something.

09:03.910 --> 09:05.943
I don't know if somebody
keeps getting, like,

09:05.945 --> 09:07.646
some kind of infections
all the time.

09:09.583 --> 09:12.183
She's, like, cutting people.

09:12.185 --> 09:14.185
I see her putting on nails.

09:14.187 --> 09:16.655
And I see her touching
a baby's belly,

09:16.657 --> 09:19.057
and that makes me nervous.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.326
Why is this woman
doing this?

09:21.328 --> 09:22.761
She wants the living
out of here

09:22.763 --> 09:26.731
because she feels
they brought the evil in.

09:26.733 --> 09:29.266
"Get them out. Get them out."

09:46.136 --> 09:47.836
So, Gary, I was talking
to your wife earlier,

09:47.838 --> 09:49.537
and she was saying that
whatever's in this house

09:49.539 --> 09:50.905
is going after her
and your kids.

09:50.907 --> 09:52.340
I mean, you agree with that?

09:52.342 --> 09:53.741
It definitely appears
that way.

09:53.743 --> 09:56.144
She seems to have had
every paranormal experience

09:56.146 --> 09:57.946
she can have under the sun.

09:57.948 --> 10:00.348
Now what about you?
Have you had anything?

10:00.350 --> 10:02.083
Well, we have
a lot of issues

10:02.085 --> 10:04.218
with our electronics
and electrical systems.

10:04.220 --> 10:06.554
You know, lights turning on
when there's nobody there.

10:06.556 --> 10:08.289
Televisions coming back on

10:08.291 --> 10:10.091
when there's no one there
to turn them on.

10:10.093 --> 10:12.493
Then to have something
just plugged in

10:12.495 --> 10:15.696
just to start smoking and burst
into flames for no reason?

10:15.698 --> 10:16.965
I don't know
how to explain that.

10:16.967 --> 10:18.566
Is there an issue with
the electrical here or...

10:18.568 --> 10:20.168
No, all the electrical
has been upgraded,

10:20.170 --> 10:22.470
from the panel
right to the fixtures.

10:22.472 --> 10:24.305
Okay. Anything else?

10:24.307 --> 10:27.442
One night, I had a shadow figure
come and hold me down in bed.

10:29.045 --> 10:30.512
And what'd you do?

10:30.514 --> 10:31.979
I was kinda, like, frozen,

10:31.981 --> 10:33.548
couldn't say anything,
couldn't do anything

10:33.550 --> 10:36.184
and I just kinda laid there
for a minute or so,

10:36.186 --> 10:39.854
and that I felt it just
lift up the pressure off me

10:39.856 --> 10:42.757
and it left the room.
- Wow.

10:42.759 --> 10:44.091
So now your wife
also mentioned to me

10:44.093 --> 10:45.860
she sees a big change
in your son Joseph.

10:45.862 --> 10:49.030
Yeah, he lashes out
at my wife for no reason.

10:49.032 --> 10:53.268
He physically attacks my other
children for no reason.

10:53.270 --> 10:54.869
Look, I know
teenagers are jerks.

10:54.871 --> 10:57.305
- Couldn't it just be that?
- No.

10:57.307 --> 10:58.940
I mean, he'll have, like,

10:58.942 --> 11:01.076
a glassy but crazy, you know,
look in his eye,

11:01.078 --> 11:04.345
almost like it's not my son.

11:04.347 --> 11:06.614
He has, like, an evil smile.

11:06.616 --> 11:08.216
I hate to say my son
was possessed,

11:08.218 --> 11:10.151
but, I mean, it almost
gave me that impression.

11:10.153 --> 11:11.419
I mean,
what do you think is here?

11:11.421 --> 11:15.123
I don't know if it's demonic,
but I just want it gone.

11:19.896 --> 11:21.663
I'm feeling a paralysis thing.

11:23.734 --> 11:26.234
Somebody having
that happen to them.

11:26.236 --> 11:28.570
Can't move, can't move.

11:28.572 --> 11:30.304
Boy.

11:30.306 --> 11:33.842
I'm seeing these small
black shadow things.

11:33.844 --> 11:35.777
Do you have any idea yet
what these things are?

11:35.779 --> 11:38.113
I think they're, like,
some kind of demonic thing.

11:40.517 --> 11:43.184
These evil little things
are in here.

11:43.186 --> 11:46.521
They are trying to take over

11:46.523 --> 11:50.658
because the evil is <i> in</i> them.

11:50.660 --> 11:53.495
What going on?

11:54.731 --> 11:57.131
Something just hurt me.

11:57.133 --> 11:59.000
Felt like I got jabbed.

12:07.077 --> 12:08.609
Joe, I was talking to
your mom and dad,

12:08.611 --> 12:11.545
and they think that whatever's
going on in this house

12:11.547 --> 12:13.081
is changing your personality.

12:13.083 --> 12:15.216
Yeah, I would agree
with that.

12:15.218 --> 12:17.418
I get mad at everybody
all the time,

12:17.420 --> 12:19.687
ridiculous little things
that happen.

12:19.689 --> 12:21.790
When I'm out of the house,
I feel like, you know,

12:21.792 --> 12:24.425
nothing bothers me.
But when I'm in here,

12:24.427 --> 12:27.495
someone could just do
something so insignificant,

12:27.497 --> 12:29.297
and I'd just lose it.

12:29.299 --> 12:31.365
All right, so what about
experiences that you've had?

12:31.367 --> 12:34.035
For 15 years,
I've seen shadow figures.

12:34.037 --> 12:35.136
What do they look like
to you?

12:35.138 --> 12:38.306
Some have, like,
oddly shaped heads,

12:38.308 --> 12:41.409
oddly shaped bodies,
tentacle-like arms.

12:41.411 --> 12:44.579
That's a new one.
Anything else going on with you?

12:44.581 --> 12:47.982
Well, I have these
vivid nightmares constantly.

12:47.984 --> 12:49.717
Do me a favor
and describe one for me.

12:49.719 --> 12:51.452
Sometimes I just wake up,

12:51.454 --> 12:52.854
and something's
trying to get me.

12:52.856 --> 12:54.322
All right, so this thing
that's trying to get you

12:54.324 --> 12:55.356
in your dream,
what does it look like?

12:55.358 --> 12:56.591
Can you describe it?

12:56.593 --> 12:57.759
I don't know if
it's a demon or not,

12:57.761 --> 13:00.461
but it sure as hell
looks like one.

13:00.463 --> 13:01.662
Anything else?

13:01.664 --> 13:04.632
I've woken up with
scratches and bruises

13:04.634 --> 13:06.334
on my back and my arms.

13:06.336 --> 13:09.204
Okay, so what are these
scratches like? Are they...

13:09.206 --> 13:11.072
They're not deep,
but they're very visible.

13:11.074 --> 13:12.807
Okay, you're the oldest.

13:12.809 --> 13:14.075
I mean, you got
younger brothers and sisters.

13:14.077 --> 13:16.010
Yeah.
You worried about
your brothers?

13:16.012 --> 13:18.746
I am very worried about them,

13:18.748 --> 13:21.081
and I'm very concerned
about my sister

13:21.083 --> 13:22.517
because of how young she is.

13:22.519 --> 13:24.285
Um...

13:24.287 --> 13:27.856
Sorry. I don't wanna see her
be affected in the future.

13:30.961 --> 13:34.529
Someone here
might be getting influenced.

13:34.531 --> 13:37.031
These things wanna, like,
take over.

13:37.033 --> 13:38.766
Like, it's not, like,
influenced subtly.

13:38.768 --> 13:40.702
No, no, no, it's change.

13:40.704 --> 13:42.203
Like, change.

13:44.174 --> 13:46.073
What do you mean?

13:46.075 --> 13:48.509
I think a personality change.

13:48.511 --> 13:49.977
I think maybe the living
are thinking,

13:49.979 --> 13:51.513
like, this is nightmares.

13:53.250 --> 13:55.483
Is it specifically
the person in this room?

13:56.653 --> 13:57.919
So what do they want
with this kid?

13:57.921 --> 14:01.456
They would like
to take over the kid.

14:10.200 --> 14:12.400
Samantha, how old are you?

14:12.402 --> 14:14.402
- Um, 6.
-6. Okay.

14:14.404 --> 14:16.204
So I was talking
to Mommy today,

14:16.206 --> 14:17.672
and she was telling me
there's some scary things

14:17.674 --> 14:19.641
going on in this house.

14:19.643 --> 14:21.609
Can you tell me about
anything that you've seen

14:21.611 --> 14:22.877
that might have scared you?

14:22.879 --> 14:27.081
I saw, like, shadows
and stuff around the house.

14:27.083 --> 14:28.882
Can you tell me
what those shadow things

14:28.884 --> 14:30.351
looked like to you?

14:30.353 --> 14:33.687
Like, they're, like,
um, on the wall.

14:33.689 --> 14:35.223
They're, like, all black.

14:35.225 --> 14:37.491
And then one of them,
like, leaves.

14:37.493 --> 14:38.826
Like, they disappear.

14:38.828 --> 14:40.761
Okay, anything else
scare you?

14:40.763 --> 14:42.597
I saw a ghost bear.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.633
How big was he?

14:45.635 --> 14:49.069
He was, like,
up to the table.

14:49.071 --> 14:51.472
So he's kinda big.

14:51.474 --> 14:54.642
I, like, heard steps
and then saw a bear

14:54.644 --> 14:56.377
walking, like, tip-toeing,

14:56.379 --> 14:58.446
and then I ran back
to my room.

14:58.448 --> 15:00.548
So you afraid
to be here in the house?

15:01.585 --> 15:03.585
Okay.

15:07.457 --> 15:09.223
I don't like this.

15:09.225 --> 15:13.193
No, no. This is bad.

15:13.195 --> 15:17.064
I don't know why these, like,
demon things are here,

15:17.066 --> 15:18.066
but they are.

15:20.970 --> 15:23.605
They're messing with the kid
in this room, too.

15:23.607 --> 15:26.140
I think these evil things
are hurting people.

15:26.142 --> 15:28.109
I feel like this kids
are, like...

15:30.947 --> 15:32.213
not okay.

15:32.215 --> 15:34.415
- It's upsetting me.
- Okay.

15:34.417 --> 15:36.584
I keep hearing,
"Hurting the baby."

15:37.954 --> 15:40.020
They're being, like, taken over.

15:40.022 --> 15:42.624
The kid's, like,
completely possessed.

15:56.572 --> 15:58.106
So whenever I get to town,

15:58.108 --> 16:00.441
the first call I make
is to the local police chief.

16:00.443 --> 16:03.077
Turns out there was
a horrible murder/suicide

16:03.079 --> 16:05.947
on Jen's property
back in the 1930s.

16:05.949 --> 16:09.383
I'm heading over now to find out
exactly what happened.

16:13.990 --> 16:15.923
So, Chief, thanks
for meeting with me.

16:15.925 --> 16:19.293
I know my client's property
is literally right here.

16:19.295 --> 16:22.296
And this pond area used to be
part of the property, right?

16:22.298 --> 16:25.466
Back in the 1930s, this pond
and the surrounding areas

16:25.468 --> 16:27.034
was part of
a massive dairy farm.

16:27.036 --> 16:28.502
It was part of the estate.

16:28.504 --> 16:30.371
What can tell me about
the victims in this case?

16:30.373 --> 16:32.239
Well, the first victim
is Bertie Wells.

16:32.241 --> 16:33.474
She was a neighbor

16:33.476 --> 16:35.042
of the people that owned
the property at the time.

16:35.044 --> 16:37.878
On October 5, 1937, she took
her 3-year-old son John

16:37.880 --> 16:40.180
for a walk
around 6:00 at night.

16:40.182 --> 16:42.116
Several hours later,
her husband Edgar comes home.

16:42.118 --> 16:43.584
He finds the house empty.

16:43.586 --> 16:46.587
He knows something's wrong,
so he calls the police.

16:46.589 --> 16:48.422
They start a massive search
of the area.

16:48.424 --> 16:50.358
Several hours into the search,
they saw

16:50.360 --> 16:52.493
the head of Bertie Wells
bobbing in the water

16:52.495 --> 16:54.028
in the middle of the pond.

16:54.030 --> 16:58.566
When they retrieve her,
they find the body of John,

16:58.568 --> 17:01.502
his icy arms
still wrapped, frozen,

17:01.504 --> 17:02.837
in his mother's arms.

17:02.839 --> 17:05.373
Jeez. Now what was
the official cause of death?

17:05.375 --> 17:07.942
These are
the death certificates

17:07.944 --> 17:10.678
showing suffocation
from drowning.

17:10.680 --> 17:12.980
She was only 41. What a shame.

17:16.318 --> 17:18.219
I'm seeing this other woman.

17:18.221 --> 17:20.354
She might be in her 30s or 40s.

17:20.356 --> 17:22.557
It's a white female.
She's face-down.

17:22.559 --> 17:25.726
She's wearing a red dress
and she has blonde hair.

17:25.728 --> 17:28.329
It looks like
she doesn't have any bones.

17:28.330 --> 17:29.931
She's all liquid.

17:31.600 --> 17:35.536
I think she died
somewhere near the property.

17:35.538 --> 17:39.673
This felt recent to me --
the 1920s, the 1930s.

17:39.675 --> 17:43.277
I felt despair, and then I felt
a broken heart and pain.

17:43.279 --> 17:45.780
And then I got "missing"
and I got "lost."

17:45.782 --> 17:48.182
Like, that could be
how she feels.

17:48.184 --> 17:52.286
She was a mother. Like, I keep
seeing her over a baby.

17:52.288 --> 17:55.289
I'm hearing
infant crying and dying.

17:55.291 --> 17:59.460
And the older woman says,
"Not my fault."

18:01.831 --> 18:05.099
So far, I've got a family
being attacked in their own home

18:05.101 --> 18:07.168
and a horribly murder/suicide
that took place

18:07.170 --> 18:09.537
right on my client's
original property.

18:09.539 --> 18:11.672
But I gotta see
if there's anything else.

18:13.109 --> 18:14.442
Searching through old records,

18:14.444 --> 18:17.512
I find this Hungarian Count,
who committed suicide

18:17.514 --> 18:20.714
right next door
to Jen and Gary's house.

18:20.716 --> 18:24.318
So I got local historian looking
into this strange case for me,

18:24.320 --> 18:26.387
and she says the death
was a combination

18:26.389 --> 18:28.656
of a lost fortune,
mental illness,

18:28.658 --> 18:30.758
and lots of booze.

18:36.399 --> 18:38.866
Well, Amanda, thanks for
helping me out with this case.

18:38.868 --> 18:40.501
This seems like
a really crazy story.

18:40.503 --> 18:42.670
I mean, I've done
over 140 of these cases,

18:42.672 --> 18:45.138
and I've never come across
European royalty.

18:45.140 --> 18:46.340
It is crazy.

18:46.342 --> 18:48.275
So what can you tell me
about this Count?

18:48.277 --> 18:50.644
The Count's name
was Rudolf Palffy.

18:50.646 --> 18:52.680
And the Palffy family
was quite wealthy

18:52.682 --> 18:54.415
in the 1800s
back in Hungary.

18:54.417 --> 18:55.817
Okay.

18:55.819 --> 18:59.687
In 1873, Rudolf's father
declared financial ruin.

18:59.689 --> 19:01.755
Well, he's in despair from
losing all his money,

19:01.757 --> 19:04.625
and he takes a gun
and shoots himself.

19:04.627 --> 19:08.696
Really? Okay, so Rudolf's dad
is dead now. What does he do?

19:08.698 --> 19:11.498
Well, Rudolf goes to France
to live with his brother Arthur,

19:11.500 --> 19:14.168
thinking that Arthur
may still have some money

19:14.170 --> 19:16.837
and they can continue to live
a lavish lifestyle in France.

19:16.839 --> 19:18.105
But he arrives
and discovers that

19:18.107 --> 19:20.174
Arthur actually
doesn't have any money.

19:20.176 --> 19:23.711
And in 1889, Arthur follows
in his father's footsteps,

19:23.713 --> 19:26.380
and takes a pistol
and shoots and kills himself.

19:26.382 --> 19:28.882
That's crazy.
Okay, so what happens next?

19:28.884 --> 19:32.052
Rudolf ends up marrying
his late brother's girlfriend,

19:32.054 --> 19:34.889
Rosalia Zimmerman...
- Okay.

19:34.891 --> 19:36.424
...who is a commoner
from Switzerland.

19:36.426 --> 19:40.060
And the family in Hungary
does not like this at all.

19:40.062 --> 19:41.195
Any idea why?

19:41.197 --> 19:42.797
Well, he was Catholic
from Hungary.

19:42.799 --> 19:44.799
And with her last name
being Zimmerman,

19:44.801 --> 19:46.533
she was likely Jewish.

19:46.535 --> 19:48.636
So there probably
were religious issues

19:48.638 --> 19:50.671
that caused them
to have more conflict.

19:50.673 --> 19:54.008
How does this kid end up
in Mahwah for all places?

19:54.010 --> 19:55.710
He decides to come to America

19:55.712 --> 19:57.812
and see if he can get
a fresh start.

19:57.814 --> 19:59.813
Okay, so when does
he wind up getting here?

19:59.815 --> 20:02.817
1891. He takes up residency
with his wife in a small cottage

20:02.819 --> 20:05.152
that's not far from
your client's property.

20:05.154 --> 20:07.120
He had $5,000 when he arrived,

20:07.122 --> 20:09.757
which is about $140,000
in today's dollars.

20:09.759 --> 20:12.660
Wow.
But blasts through
all of that in a year.

20:12.662 --> 20:14.762
Okay, so I know this guy
eventually kills himself.

20:14.764 --> 20:16.296
How does he do it?

20:16.298 --> 20:19.433
Well, in 1893, according to
these newspaper articles,

20:19.435 --> 20:22.436
he's out drinking with
the locals in Mahwah,

20:22.438 --> 20:26.741
and he comes home and gets in
a huge argument with his wife.

20:26.743 --> 20:30.311
Then he gives her a kiss,
says, "I love you dearly,

20:30.313 --> 20:32.379
but Switzerland
cannot rule Hungary."

20:32.381 --> 20:35.449
Then he turns
and grabs his pistol,

20:35.451 --> 20:38.319
puts it to his head and shoots
and kills himself.

20:38.321 --> 20:40.688
- Okay.
- He's about 32 years of age.

20:43.526 --> 20:46.527
I'm seeing that crazy guy
running around again.

20:46.529 --> 20:48.395
Can you describe him?

20:48.397 --> 20:50.731
I wouldn't put him
older than 30.

20:50.733 --> 20:52.300
I think he was mentally ill.

20:54.070 --> 20:57.238
He's got soot or burns
on his face.

20:59.008 --> 21:00.774
I keep hearing,
"I gotta get outta here.

21:00.776 --> 21:01.909
Gotta get outta here."

21:05.181 --> 21:07.180
He felt trapped.

21:07.182 --> 21:09.683
Just overwhelmed.

21:09.685 --> 21:13.921
He feels confused.
He feels like it's too much.

21:13.923 --> 21:17.658
Okay, so this guy's father
and his brother commit suicide.

21:17.660 --> 21:20.627
He winds up coming here,
right near my client's property,

21:20.629 --> 21:22.830
has money issues,
and kills himself as well?

21:22.832 --> 21:24.231
Yes.

21:24.233 --> 21:25.700
What happens with the wife
after he kills himself?

21:25.702 --> 21:28.035
She's distraught.
She's left penniless.

21:28.037 --> 21:32.372
She ends up with nothing.
It's definitely a tragic story.

21:35.144 --> 21:37.712
I'm getting a connection
between the crazy guy

21:37.714 --> 21:39.780
and the nasty old woman.

21:39.782 --> 21:42.249
There's something with them,
friction.

21:42.251 --> 21:44.718
He's afraid of her.

21:44.720 --> 21:47.188
Why are you afraid?

21:47.190 --> 21:48.455
Do you get anything else

21:48.457 --> 21:50.924
on who she was
when she was alive?

21:50.926 --> 21:54.061
She's extremely religious.

21:54.063 --> 21:56.263
A lot of, like, praying.

21:59.035 --> 22:02.203
I saw her living
in a very nice place.

22:02.205 --> 22:04.205
She's from another country.

22:04.207 --> 22:07.408
She said that it took
a long time to get here.

22:07.410 --> 22:11.078
Then it was bad because
her husband died.

22:11.080 --> 22:14.115
Her husband died horrible.

22:15.250 --> 22:16.750
Young, young.

22:16.752 --> 22:20.287
She lost all her money somehow
and now she's mad.

22:48.450 --> 22:50.651
I've already got
multiple suicides

22:50.653 --> 22:52.519
<i>and</i> a murder on Jen's property.

22:52.521 --> 22:54.488
But something else
caught my eye in research.

22:54.490 --> 22:56.156
A mom killed four of her kids

22:56.158 --> 22:57.958
just down the street
from Jen's house.

22:57.960 --> 22:59.393
I'm going to meet
the local sheriff,

22:59.395 --> 23:02.196
who says it was one of the worst
crimes in Mahwah's history.

23:12.007 --> 23:13.207
So, Sheriff, you mentioned
on the phone

23:13.209 --> 23:14.674
that there was
this quadruple homicide

23:14.676 --> 23:16.410
that happened right near
my client's property.

23:16.412 --> 23:19.280
It involved a couple
that lived in Mahwah.

23:19.282 --> 23:22.282
Kenneth McDonald,
he was 32 years old.

23:22.284 --> 23:24.351
And his wife, Carol McDonald,
she was 29.

23:24.353 --> 23:27.688
She was a stay-at-home mom,
caring for their four children.

23:27.690 --> 23:30.591
There came a point,
early in 1953,

23:30.593 --> 23:33.761
where Kenneth found out that
Carol was cheating on him.

23:33.763 --> 23:36.830
He was devastated,
furious, and at one point

23:36.832 --> 23:39.633
left the household
and filed for divorce.

23:39.635 --> 23:41.969
- Okay.
- When she decides she wants

23:41.971 --> 23:43.503
to retaliate
against the husband.

23:43.505 --> 23:45.172
Okay, so what'd
she wind up doing?

23:45.174 --> 23:47.708
So on May 3, 1953,

23:47.710 --> 23:50.044
she wakes up
her four children,

23:50.046 --> 23:51.712
little after midnight.

23:51.714 --> 23:54.381
These children ranged
from age 2 to 7,

23:54.383 --> 23:55.849
two boys and two girls.

23:55.851 --> 23:59.520
She walked them out into
the garage to the family car,

23:59.522 --> 24:01.488
put them in the car,
turned on the engine,

24:01.490 --> 24:03.123
and then
she came back inside.

24:03.125 --> 24:04.325
All right, so let me
get this straight.

24:04.327 --> 24:05.792
She leaves the four kids
in the car,

24:05.794 --> 24:07.427
and then walks
back into the house.

24:07.429 --> 24:09.429
Yes.
She went in the house

24:09.431 --> 24:12.165
and wrote six separate
suicide letters.

24:12.167 --> 24:13.600
As she's taking
two hours to write

24:13.602 --> 24:16.202
these six individual
suicide letters,

24:16.204 --> 24:18.038
these poor four children
are in that car,

24:18.040 --> 24:19.873
getting asphyxiated.

24:19.875 --> 24:21.742
There came a point
where she realized,

24:21.744 --> 24:23.410
maybe this isn't
the right thing to do.

24:23.412 --> 24:25.713
She went back into the garage,
but, of course, it was too late.

24:25.715 --> 24:26.981
The four children were dead.

24:26.983 --> 24:28.748
That's actually an article
I found

24:28.750 --> 24:30.084
on the whole story there.

24:31.621 --> 24:34.788
Cops respond to the house,
they arrest her.

24:34.790 --> 24:37.758
She's subsequently charged
with four counts of murder.

24:37.760 --> 24:39.293
Here's a picture
of her being arrested

24:39.295 --> 24:41.462
in the police car
with the detective.

24:42.899 --> 24:44.397
Look at that.

24:44.399 --> 24:46.366
After her arrest, she was
transported right to this jail,

24:46.368 --> 24:47.434
right where we're standing.

24:47.436 --> 24:49.202
She tried to commit suicide.

24:49.204 --> 24:50.770
So I assume they got
a conviction.

24:50.772 --> 24:53.173
The saddest part
of this whole story

24:53.175 --> 24:55.576
is that she was
deemed to be insane

24:55.578 --> 24:56.977
and never stood trial.

24:56.979 --> 24:59.913
She was sent to
a state psychiatric hospital

24:59.915 --> 25:02.316
where, after three years,
she was released

25:02.318 --> 25:04.051
and never had to pay
for this crime.

25:04.053 --> 25:07.020
- Are you kidding me?
- Wish I was.

25:12.662 --> 25:14.661
Something's happening here.

25:14.663 --> 25:17.598
I'm getting, like, a fight
between two people.

25:17.600 --> 25:20.000
There's two people fighting
in this area.

25:22.338 --> 25:24.938
One is definitely a male.

25:24.940 --> 25:26.206
Fighting, fighting.

25:26.208 --> 25:28.875
It's not good.

25:28.877 --> 25:31.378
I don't like it.

25:31.380 --> 25:33.614
I think, like, something dies.

25:36.752 --> 25:39.886
This is not a good situation.

25:39.888 --> 25:42.623
I'm being shown a bunch of kids.

25:42.625 --> 25:45.392
Something about an attack

25:45.394 --> 25:47.027
at night.

25:47.029 --> 25:48.362
It happened inside.

25:48.364 --> 25:50.296
I see absolute horror,

25:50.298 --> 25:52.266
over and over again.

25:59.241 --> 26:01.375
I saw many disturbing
things on my walk,

26:01.377 --> 26:03.143
but two stood out.

26:03.145 --> 26:07.014
First, the old woman
attacking a living child.

26:07.016 --> 26:09.349
She is behind the bed

26:09.351 --> 26:12.853
with her hands on this child's,
like, chest/neck area.

26:12.855 --> 26:16.990
He was, um, being choked.

26:16.992 --> 26:20.193
She had a very unusual face.

26:20.195 --> 26:22.262
She had very dark eyes.

26:22.264 --> 26:24.864
Next, I described
the black shadow things

26:24.866 --> 26:28.201
trying to possess a child
in the upstairs bedroom.

26:28.203 --> 26:31.405
There were about
three or four of them

26:31.407 --> 26:32.939
surrounding the bed,

26:32.941 --> 26:37.278
trying to, like, take over
the child's body.

26:44.686 --> 26:46.687
Amy, is this what you saw?

26:46.689 --> 26:48.889
Yes.

27:07.659 --> 27:10.527
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

27:10.529 --> 27:12.596
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

27:12.598 --> 27:16.066
and our clients
for the first time.

27:16.068 --> 27:18.335
Amy this is Jen
and her husband Gary.

27:18.337 --> 27:22.005
They live here with
their four very sweet kids.

27:22.007 --> 27:23.607
This is Joseph, who's 15.

27:23.609 --> 27:26.342
This is Ryan and Michael,
who are 13-year-old twins,

27:26.344 --> 27:28.545
and Samantha, who's 6.

27:28.547 --> 27:31.415
Now we're sitting here,
so obviously the activity's bad,

27:31.417 --> 27:33.350
but these two say it's so bad,

27:33.352 --> 27:35.752
they don't think it's safe
for anybody to be in this house,

27:35.754 --> 27:37.888
especially Joe.

27:37.890 --> 27:40.157
So now that Amy knows
who you guys are,

27:40.159 --> 27:42.025
I'm going to ask her
to describe her walk for us.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.164
So when I first got here,

27:47.166 --> 27:50.600
I saw a deceased female

27:50.602 --> 27:53.437
who was laying face-down.

27:53.439 --> 27:56.473
I got that she was
in her 30s or her 40s.

27:56.475 --> 27:58.542
She did look a little odd.

27:58.544 --> 28:01.578
To me, it looked like
almost, like, a pool of her

28:01.580 --> 28:05.482
because it didn't seem like
she had any bones.

28:05.484 --> 28:08.652
A lot of pain and despair.

28:08.654 --> 28:10.487
Something about
her being a mother

28:10.489 --> 28:12.789
but she didn't have her kids,
and then somebody

28:12.791 --> 28:16.192
was talking about someone
being lost or missing

28:16.194 --> 28:20.163
so that she had a broken heart,
and I think it's possible

28:20.165 --> 28:22.399
she died somewhere
on the property.

28:22.401 --> 28:24.701
I know you didn't get a lot,
but what you did get

28:24.703 --> 28:26.737
reminds me of a woman
I came across in research.

28:26.739 --> 28:29.206
Now back in the 1930s,
this property was part

28:29.208 --> 28:30.640
of a 500-acre dairy farm.

28:30.642 --> 28:32.342
Now a woman named Bertie Wells
lived on

28:32.344 --> 28:33.944
the property next door
to that farm

28:33.946 --> 28:35.112
with her husband and two sons.

28:35.114 --> 28:38.615
So now on the evening
of October 5, 1937,

28:38.617 --> 28:40.350
Bertie took
her 3-year-old kid, John,

28:40.352 --> 28:41.785
for a walk right to that pond

28:41.787 --> 28:43.320
that's only
around the block here.

28:43.322 --> 28:45.221
She went missing.

28:45.223 --> 28:47.758
Now the cops wind up doing
a town-wide search

28:47.760 --> 28:49.093
for Bertie and the kid.

28:49.095 --> 28:50.360
Within a few hours,

28:50.362 --> 28:51.962
they found both their bodies
in the pond.

28:53.499 --> 28:54.965
From what the cops could gather,

28:54.967 --> 28:57.701
Bertie had walked into the pond
with the boy in her arms,

28:57.703 --> 28:59.937
and drowned them both.

28:59.939 --> 29:03.073
And I got their
death certificates here.

29:03.075 --> 29:04.641
Now the only motive
for this suicide

29:04.643 --> 29:06.443
was that Bertie had been
depressed for months

29:06.445 --> 29:07.778
over her declining health.

29:07.780 --> 29:09.312
So I'm just curious
if you think Bertie Wells

29:09.314 --> 29:10.914
could be the woman
you might have seen?

29:10.916 --> 29:12.716
Yeah,
that's a big possibility.

29:16.655 --> 29:19.756
The next person that
I ran into was a male,

29:19.758 --> 29:21.992
and I first
encountered him outside,

29:21.994 --> 29:24.794
and he was running around
like a frickin' maniac.

29:24.796 --> 29:27.698
He's extremely confused
and scared.

29:27.700 --> 29:31.401
He doesn't get
that he's deceased,

29:31.403 --> 29:32.870
which is a big problem.

29:34.406 --> 29:38.675
I think that the living here
would maybe see him

29:38.677 --> 29:41.077
running outside in the yard.

29:41.079 --> 29:43.880
The way that I saw him was
very much as a shadow person,

29:43.882 --> 29:45.215
as a shadow figure.

29:45.217 --> 29:47.884
- Wow.
- I see him in the back.

29:47.886 --> 29:50.653
He just stands there
and watches you.

29:50.655 --> 29:51.921
Yeah.

29:51.923 --> 29:54.224
He, like,
does not stop moving

29:54.226 --> 29:55.959
And he, because of that,

29:55.961 --> 29:59.096
can affect, like,
the electricity in the house

29:59.098 --> 30:02.365
or, like, TVs and stuff
like that, you know?

30:02.367 --> 30:04.434
Gary, tell her what's going on
with the electric.

30:04.436 --> 30:06.036
We leave the house,
everything was off.

30:06.038 --> 30:08.238
We'd come home, the lights
in the attic are on,

30:08.240 --> 30:11.508
there's TVs on, radios on.
I mean, you name it.

30:11.510 --> 30:13.443
Wow. Okay.

30:13.445 --> 30:15.679
You might, when you're
around him,

30:15.681 --> 30:18.515
feel a lot
of emotional swings.

30:20.119 --> 30:23.553
It's just a constant
struggle for me to be --

30:23.555 --> 30:25.388
just to be happy
with anything.

30:25.390 --> 30:27.657
You know, it's changing
my personality.

30:27.659 --> 30:30.928
I can leave work in a great mood
and I'll walk into the house,

30:30.930 --> 30:33.730
and all of a sudden,
I'm just angry at everybody.

30:33.732 --> 30:35.332
He can make you
feel anxious

30:35.334 --> 30:37.934
and dizzy and nauseous
and drained.

30:37.936 --> 30:40.537
My energy is gone.

30:40.539 --> 30:43.673
I can sleep all day and still
feel like I haven't slept.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.008
It's terrible.

30:45.010 --> 30:46.210
She talked about something else
that we didn't hit on,

30:46.212 --> 30:48.145
was the anxiety, being anxious.

30:48.147 --> 30:50.480
The anxiety,
the panic attacks,

30:50.482 --> 30:53.083
as each month goes by,
it gets worse and worse.

30:53.085 --> 30:54.517
They tried putting me
on meds for it.

30:54.519 --> 30:56.620
Nothing works.

30:56.622 --> 30:57.954
Now all that stuff
they talked about

30:57.956 --> 30:59.422
sounds like
it could be this guy.

30:59.424 --> 31:02.125
Yes, that's that guy.

31:02.127 --> 31:05.229
Get any idea who this guy might
have been when he was alive?

31:05.231 --> 31:07.163
Due to the fact that
he wouldn't stop moving,

31:07.165 --> 31:10.133
I could not really
see him very well,

31:10.135 --> 31:12.902
but I'm thinking
about 30 years of age.

31:12.904 --> 31:16.039
But mentally,
he absolutely seemed like

31:16.041 --> 31:19.509
he was functioning
at a much younger level.

31:19.511 --> 31:23.480
I think that he might have had
some mental illness as well.

31:23.482 --> 31:25.748
Definitely was not in
a good place when he died.

31:25.750 --> 31:29.252
Also, there's
a deceased female who's here,

31:29.254 --> 31:31.321
and there's some kind
of strange connection

31:31.323 --> 31:34.825
between them,
and I'm not sure what.

31:34.827 --> 31:37.327
Well, you know,
I got a pretty good idea

31:37.329 --> 31:39.596
of who this guy might have been,

31:39.598 --> 31:41.197
but I want to wait
until you tell us

31:41.199 --> 31:43.133
about the woman you said
he was connected to.

31:43.135 --> 31:47.203
So she's the most dominant
dead person here.

31:47.205 --> 31:49.405
Got that she was in
her 40s or 50s.

31:49.407 --> 31:51.941
I got that she was
from another country,

31:51.943 --> 31:53.477
but I'm not sure where.

31:53.479 --> 31:56.579
She's extremely religious
person.

31:56.581 --> 31:58.215
<i>Extremely.</i>

31:58.217 --> 32:00.484
Got that she was married,

32:00.486 --> 32:02.819
ended up losing
all her money somehow.

32:02.821 --> 32:05.422
And then
it got worse for her

32:05.424 --> 32:07.691
because then
her husband died,

32:07.693 --> 32:10.394
and apparently,
it was a horrible death.

32:10.396 --> 32:15.098
After he died, that was it.
Boom. Everything went to...

32:15.100 --> 32:16.900
Now I know who
you're talking about.

32:16.902 --> 32:19.770
So in the 1890s,
there was a European couple

32:19.772 --> 32:21.971
that lived in a cottage
right next to this property.

32:21.973 --> 32:25.375
Now this guy was part of
the Hungarian royal family.

32:25.377 --> 32:26.877
His name was Rudolf Palffy.

32:26.879 --> 32:28.679
Now the expert
I talked to told me

32:28.681 --> 32:30.714
that Rudolf and his brother
were pretty immature.

32:30.716 --> 32:33.649
They basically partied
and spent the father's fortune.

32:33.651 --> 32:35.985
The father went bankrupt
in 1873.

32:35.987 --> 32:38.121
Now the father was so ashamed
by what happened,

32:38.123 --> 32:40.924
he shot and killed himself
a few years later.

32:40.926 --> 32:43.860
Rudolf then went to go live
with his brother, Arthur,

32:43.862 --> 32:46.430
hoping to, you know,
get money off of him,

32:46.432 --> 32:47.931
but he was living in France.

32:47.933 --> 32:50.734
Arthur winds up shooting himself
in the head in 1889

32:50.736 --> 32:51.902
and killing himself.

32:54.072 --> 32:56.406
After Arthur's suicide,
Rudolf married

32:56.408 --> 32:59.176
his dead brother's girlfriend,
Rosalia Zimmerman.

32:59.178 --> 33:01.277
Rudolf's family was pissed
about the marriage

33:01.279 --> 33:02.545
for a couple of reasons.

33:02.547 --> 33:04.147
First, he was royalty,
and she wasn't.

33:04.149 --> 33:06.015
So the other issue
they had with the marriage

33:06.017 --> 33:09.186
was that family was Catholic,
and she was Jewish.

33:09.188 --> 33:11.355
The expert I talked to said
they wanted a fresh start

33:11.357 --> 33:13.290
and they came to America
from France.

33:13.292 --> 33:14.724
When they did come here, though,

33:14.726 --> 33:17.728
he had the equivalent of what
would have been $140,000,

33:17.730 --> 33:20.263
and he went through it
within a year.

33:20.265 --> 33:22.966
In 1893,
Rudolf goes out drinking

33:22.968 --> 33:24.700
with some of the locals in town.

33:24.702 --> 33:27.170
When he gets home, him and
Rosalia got into a huge fight.

33:27.172 --> 33:29.573
The two were arguing
when he stopped, he said,

33:29.575 --> 33:30.707
"I love you dearly,

33:30.709 --> 33:32.642
but Switzerland cannot
rule Hungary,"

33:32.644 --> 33:35.412
pulls out a pistol
and blows his brains out.

33:37.383 --> 33:39.216
And he did it
right in front of her.

33:40.386 --> 33:42.185
Now you said he was about 30?

33:42.187 --> 33:44.487
He was 32 when he died.

33:44.489 --> 33:46.156
So do you think
this is who you saw?

33:46.158 --> 33:47.524
Yes.

33:47.526 --> 33:50.860
Now you said the dead woman,
his wife, was dominant.

33:50.862 --> 33:53.263
Yeah. She's just bad news.

33:53.265 --> 33:56.933
She's extremely protective
of this house and the land.

33:58.137 --> 34:00.269
She's extremely angry
at the living here,

34:00.271 --> 34:02.138
and one of the things
I saw her doing

34:02.140 --> 34:05.608
was sharpening her fingernails
and scratching living people.

34:05.610 --> 34:09.344
Jen, the scratches,
you and Joseph.

34:09.347 --> 34:13.283
Scratches, bruises,
both me and the 15-year-old.

34:13.284 --> 34:15.152
They seem to come up
in the middle of the night

34:15.154 --> 34:18.221
or just show up out of nowhere.
- Interesting.

34:18.223 --> 34:20.190
The other thing was
that she had died from

34:20.192 --> 34:22.725
some kind of infections,
and now when

34:22.726 --> 34:26.396
she's around living people,
she can make you feel like that.

34:26.398 --> 34:28.331
And I was concerned
about people here

34:28.333 --> 34:31.234
developing random illnesses.

34:31.235 --> 34:34.170
They say I have, like,
reversed immune system,

34:34.172 --> 34:35.839
and they gave me
antibiotics.

34:35.841 --> 34:37.940
I have to take, like,
three, four rounds of it

34:37.943 --> 34:40.842
before anything works.
- Every time she gets a cold,

34:40.844 --> 34:43.179
it almost always
turns into pneumonia.

34:43.181 --> 34:45.547
Now could all of this be
this woman?

34:45.550 --> 34:47.583
Yes.

34:47.585 --> 34:50.920
I saw her in the blue
bedroom upstairs.

34:50.922 --> 34:52.755
That's Joseph's room, right?

34:52.757 --> 34:54.324
I did have a sketch done.

35:00.999 --> 35:02.265
Ooh.

35:08.606 --> 35:10.340
Okay.

35:19.218 --> 35:21.384
Believe me now?

35:21.386 --> 35:22.785
What is she doing to him?

35:22.787 --> 35:24.855
Strangling him.

35:27.359 --> 35:29.159
- I know it's tough to look at.
- Yeah, I-I can't.

35:29.161 --> 35:30.493
Here, we'll just turn it over.

35:35.434 --> 35:36.900
I hate to even ask
what else.

35:36.902 --> 35:41.171
There's something here that
has me much more concerned.

35:41.173 --> 35:42.973
- More than this?
- Yeah.

35:42.975 --> 35:46.375
There were these entities
that I saw during my walk.

35:46.377 --> 35:49.112
They looked like
small shadow figures

35:49.114 --> 35:52.048
or small -- They almost
looked like ghosts.

35:52.050 --> 35:53.884
Like if somebody had a child,

35:53.886 --> 35:57.386
dropped a black sheet
on the child...

35:57.388 --> 35:59.523
I've seen them everywhere
around, through the house.

35:59.525 --> 36:01.390
Little kid
with like, you know,

36:01.392 --> 36:04.427
just like you're putting,
like, a blanket over him.

36:05.931 --> 36:07.597
They do make people sick.

36:07.599 --> 36:09.999
When I came into contact
with them upstairs

36:10.001 --> 36:12.602
in the blue room,
I felt like the person,

36:12.604 --> 36:14.070
the living person in there,

36:14.072 --> 36:17.140
would have bouts of
severe nausea

36:17.142 --> 36:18.874
if not vomiting.

36:18.876 --> 36:22.111
So have you guys noticed
anything like that with Joe?

36:22.113 --> 36:24.847
Yes, he comes downstairs
and he's like,

36:24.849 --> 36:26.082
"Can I get an container
or something?

36:26.084 --> 36:27.383
I feel like I'm gonna throw up."

36:27.385 --> 36:30.153
Okay, living people here
would believe

36:30.155 --> 36:31.888
that they're having
nightmares,

36:31.890 --> 36:35.958
but it would be due to
these things influencing them.

36:35.960 --> 36:37.927
When I talk to Joe,
he told me he has

36:37.929 --> 36:40.096
constant nightmares about
a demon attacking him.

36:40.098 --> 36:42.498
He's had these nightmares
for as long as he can remember.

36:42.500 --> 36:45.101
These things also
manipulate the living

36:45.103 --> 36:46.302
when they're awake.

36:46.304 --> 36:49.506
I saw this little child,
and his personality

36:49.508 --> 36:52.842
completely changes,
and it just gave me chills

36:52.844 --> 36:54.945
seeing this vision
because it was like,

36:54.947 --> 36:58.114
you knew, like, this wasn't
this kid anymore.

36:58.116 --> 37:00.850
I mean, that's one of
our big things with Joe.

37:00.852 --> 37:02.919
Sometimes I feel like
he's not there.

37:02.921 --> 37:04.787
I don't want to use
the word "possessed,"

37:04.789 --> 37:07.457
but it's the feeling
that I get.

37:07.459 --> 37:11.260
I had a sketch done of what
I saw in the blue bedroom.

37:18.536 --> 37:21.671
I- I gotta show it to you,
even though I don't wanna.

37:21.673 --> 37:24.007
My God.

37:24.009 --> 37:26.543
I don't know what to say.

37:32.718 --> 37:35.084
What the hell are
these things?

37:35.086 --> 37:38.855
I believe that they are
a type of demonic entity.

37:41.159 --> 37:43.593
They're very bad.

37:43.595 --> 37:46.229
Well, what about Joseph?
What do they want from him?

37:46.231 --> 37:47.464
They want to possess him.

37:50.035 --> 37:51.500
And I'm always afraid
of Joseph doing

37:51.502 --> 37:54.537
something to hurt himself
or somebody else.

37:54.539 --> 37:57.774
I also saw these things
in the room across the hall.

37:57.776 --> 37:59.775
- Samantha's?
- Samantha's room.

37:59.777 --> 38:03.079
They already had her,
like, from birth.

38:03.081 --> 38:05.715
That's why the activity's
gotten worse.

38:05.717 --> 38:09.452
My God.

38:09.454 --> 38:11.354
- Is she possessed?
- Yeah.

38:11.356 --> 38:14.223
My God.

38:14.225 --> 38:16.926
There's one that's literally
inside her all the time.

38:36.181 --> 38:37.580
So, Jen, you called us in

38:37.582 --> 38:39.615
because you thought the kids
were in danger here.

38:39.617 --> 38:42.985
And I don't know if it was
mother's intuition or what,

38:42.987 --> 38:46.289
but based on what Amy's
told us, you are 100% right.

38:46.291 --> 38:48.191
So now the big question is,

38:48.193 --> 38:51.127
is there a way for you
to save your children,

38:51.129 --> 38:53.329
or do you need to pack up
before someone

38:53.331 --> 38:55.965
gets seriously hurt
and get the hell out of here?

38:55.967 --> 38:58.468
For that answer,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

39:00.272 --> 39:03.539
So, we're going to start
with the dead man.

39:03.541 --> 39:05.541
Talking about Rudolf,
the guy who shot himself?

39:05.543 --> 39:06.809
Right.

39:06.811 --> 39:08.677
So getting him
out of the house,

39:08.679 --> 39:11.948
we're going to utilize
tar water.

39:11.950 --> 39:17.087
The tar water forms
a long-lasting barrier

39:17.089 --> 39:21.757
that prevents the dead
from entering your home.

39:21.759 --> 39:24.627
You're also going to be
removing the dead lady.

39:24.629 --> 39:27.730
You mean Rudolf's wife, Rosalia?
Yes.

39:27.732 --> 39:30.600
This one, you're going
to need a medium for.

39:30.602 --> 39:34.604
Someone who is Jewish,
who is also a medium,

39:34.606 --> 39:37.207
who can come and talk to her

39:37.209 --> 39:41.644
and specifically tell her
that she's gotta go.

39:41.646 --> 39:43.880
She's gonna move on
real quick.

39:45.050 --> 39:48.284
Now as far as the demons,

39:48.286 --> 39:50.686
you do need
to set up an exorcism

39:50.688 --> 39:52.956
to take place for Sam.

39:55.827 --> 39:57.426
It could be very traumatic

39:57.428 --> 40:01.097
and this could take
several meetings.

40:01.099 --> 40:03.566
I'm already dreading
just the fact to have to

40:03.568 --> 40:04.967
try to somehow
explain it to her,

40:04.969 --> 40:06.469
let alone put her through it.

40:06.471 --> 40:09.839
It's not like she necessarily
has to be told these things.

40:09.841 --> 40:11.908
For all she knows,
he's just doing

40:11.910 --> 40:13.609
- nice little prayers over her.
- Yeah.

40:13.611 --> 40:15.912
So you're saying exorcism
for Sam.
Yes.

40:15.914 --> 40:17.246
What about Joseph?

40:17.248 --> 40:20.483
After Sam, then Joseph.

40:20.485 --> 40:22.352
How do you think Joseph's
going to react to this?

40:22.354 --> 40:24.253
I think he's gonna
feel vindicated

40:24.255 --> 40:26.856
and embrace the fight
to get it taken care of.

40:28.693 --> 40:32.395
Okay, once both of the children
have been taken care of,

40:32.397 --> 40:34.630
then the entire house
has to be blessed

40:34.632 --> 40:35.899
as well as the land.

40:35.901 --> 40:37.166
And then every year,

40:37.168 --> 40:39.936
you have to have the house
and the land blessed.

40:39.938 --> 40:42.338
So the exorcism
and then blessing the house

40:42.340 --> 40:43.806
will get rid
of the little demons?

40:43.808 --> 40:45.708
Correct.

40:45.710 --> 40:48.677
And so what about their mood
swings and personality changes?

40:48.679 --> 40:50.146
Will those get better, too?

40:50.148 --> 40:53.149
Once they're completely done
with absolutely everything,

40:53.151 --> 40:55.051
yeah, it'll be good.

40:55.053 --> 40:56.385
It's funny, when we talked,

40:56.387 --> 40:58.354
you broke my heart actually,
listening to you.

40:58.356 --> 40:59.722
All you wanted was
your kids to be safe

40:59.724 --> 41:01.191
and to save your marriage.

41:01.193 --> 41:04.828
Now she basically gave you
a map on how to do that.

41:04.830 --> 41:07.697
So are you going to do
what Amy tells you to do?

41:07.699 --> 41:08.832
Absolutely.

41:08.834 --> 41:11.467
There's not a question
in my mind.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.336
I can't thank you enough...

41:15.974 --> 41:18.908
'cause it's gotta stop now.

41:29.187 --> 41:31.454
It won't be easy
removing the dead

41:31.456 --> 41:32.855
in Jen and Gary's home,

41:32.857 --> 41:35.658
but with the help
of a medium and tar water,

41:35.660 --> 41:37.960
they can be banished.

41:37.962 --> 41:41.664
If they do that and get
Sam and Joe exercised,

41:41.666 --> 41:45.167
this family will find the peace
they've been searching for.
