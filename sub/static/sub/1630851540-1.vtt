WEBVTT

01:01.625 --> 01:02.541
Get them out.

01:03.291 --> 01:05.750
Wait until I'm gone to uncover them.

01:05.833 --> 01:07.833
I'll let you know via walkie-talkie.

01:30.208 --> 01:31.166
Shit.

01:33.625 --> 01:34.958
What the hell is this?

01:35.583 --> 01:38.083
-Where are we?
-I don't know, but we're far away.

01:38.583 --> 01:40.458
I'm not sure how long we were asleep.

01:40.541 --> 01:42.333
Those assholes drugged us.

01:42.416 --> 01:43.666
What's with these monks?

01:44.875 --> 01:45.708
I don't know…

01:46.208 --> 01:47.083
Grandma?

01:47.166 --> 01:48.458
Is that Grandma?

01:49.208 --> 01:50.958
-Grandma!
-My girl.

01:51.583 --> 01:53.125
-Grandma!
-My girl! Are you okay?

01:53.208 --> 01:55.125
-Dad.
-My sweet daughter.

01:56.791 --> 01:57.625
Fuck.

01:59.958 --> 02:02.333
-They didn't hurt you, did they?
-No, we're okay.

02:02.416 --> 02:03.708
-Hold on.
-What?

02:04.208 --> 02:05.041
Where's Ali?

02:05.625 --> 02:06.541
-What?
-What? Ali?

02:07.041 --> 02:08.458
He was in the car with us.

02:09.250 --> 02:10.333
Fuck.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.291
A NETFLIX SERIES

02:20.916 --> 02:22.250
DRUG TRAFFICKING:
REMARKABLE ESCAPE

02:22.333 --> 02:25.583
Today in the news, a remarkable escape.
A commando armed with explosives…

02:25.666 --> 02:28.958
Explosives and everything.
They weren't joking.

02:29.041 --> 02:32.500
…transferred three prisoners
from Poissy Prison to Fresnes.

02:32.583 --> 02:36.125
Gérard Hazan, his son, Joseph,
and Olivier Pariente

02:36.208 --> 02:37.625
are now nowhere to be found.

02:37.708 --> 02:41.000
These former butchers
became figures in organized crime,

02:41.083 --> 02:43.125
involved in
a big drug trafficking operation.

02:43.208 --> 02:45.708
I swear, they're real thugs. I swear.

02:45.791 --> 02:48.000
They created a strain of weed

02:48.083 --> 02:51.041
known in the drug world as Pastraweed.

02:51.125 --> 02:54.250
Yes, hello, Mr. Prosecutor.
It's Aïda Benkikir again.

02:54.333 --> 02:58.625
I'm calling because I'm really worried.
As you know, I'm the Hazan family lawyer,

02:58.708 --> 03:02.083
and I'd like to give you some details
about what happened.

03:02.166 --> 03:04.916
Could you call me back
as soon as possible?

03:05.000 --> 03:06.541
Thank you very much. Bye.

03:11.041 --> 03:13.291
It's okay, my love. They're asleep.

03:13.375 --> 03:16.125
I see. You're calling her "my love"
right in front of me.

03:17.500 --> 03:19.333
Call him "darling" while you're at it.

03:19.416 --> 03:21.166
You're lucky I've settled down.

03:21.250 --> 03:24.708
Before, I would've chopped you up
and given you to the neighbors.

03:24.791 --> 03:26.250
-Youssef!
-Calm down.

03:26.333 --> 03:28.250
You liked your life. Joseph was in prison.

03:28.333 --> 03:29.625
-Not at all.
-Yeah, right.

03:29.708 --> 03:32.125
Now he's escaped,
he'll sink his teeth into you.

03:32.208 --> 03:34.291
Stop saying he escaped.
Don't you get it yet?

03:34.375 --> 03:37.208
He had no reason to escape.
He was gonna get out soon.

03:37.708 --> 03:40.250
I can't reach Ali, Aure,
or her grandmother.

03:40.333 --> 03:41.625
Something's off.

03:42.625 --> 03:43.958
What are you thinking?

03:45.125 --> 03:46.666
I think they were kidnapped.

03:46.750 --> 03:48.708
Kidnapped? By Gérard's girlfriend?

03:48.791 --> 03:51.166
She's not "Gérard's girlfriend."
She's Pénélope Cavillan.

03:51.250 --> 03:54.458
She's worked with the cartels for years.
That woman is super dangerous.

03:55.125 --> 03:56.916
What are we gonna do, then?

03:57.000 --> 03:59.875
We can't do anything.
I just need to see the prosecutor.

04:05.708 --> 04:06.750
What should we do?

04:06.833 --> 04:09.666
Should we leave them here
or move them somewhere else?

04:09.750 --> 04:12.708
No, we're waiting here.
The boss will be here soon.

04:13.666 --> 04:14.708
Okay.

04:15.833 --> 04:17.666
We need to know why we're here, okay?

04:17.750 --> 04:21.375
I'm gonna try to befriend them
and get information out of them.

04:21.458 --> 04:24.166
What?
You're not gonna befriend them. Fuck.

04:24.250 --> 04:26.500
We know we're here because of Jaurès.

04:26.583 --> 04:28.833
-We're gonna get killed.
-Stop with that.

04:28.916 --> 04:30.666
No one knows about Jaurès. No one.

04:30.750 --> 04:33.083
You can tell
they all speak Spanish, not Dutch.

04:33.958 --> 04:37.333
Who speaks Spanish here?
That's not a bad way to connect.

04:37.416 --> 04:39.041
I know a few words.

04:39.125 --> 04:41.166
-Yeah?
-A few words…

04:41.250 --> 04:42.333
Yeah, well…

04:42.833 --> 04:45.333
Yeah, mostly lyrics to Gipsy Kings songs.

04:45.416 --> 04:46.875
Damn it, Olive.

04:46.958 --> 04:49.250
Okay. Everyone, breathe.

04:49.333 --> 04:52.416
Calm down. Nothing can happen to us.
We're in a sacred place.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.000
Spaniards are very religious.

04:54.083 --> 04:56.791
Remember the caretaker
with her nativity scene?

04:57.791 --> 05:00.916
She screamed at the neighbor
because his dog pissed on the donkey.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.708
What does this have to do
with Mrs. Alonzo?

05:02.791 --> 05:04.291
They have fucking Kalashnikovs.

05:09.083 --> 05:10.000
Fuck.

05:11.875 --> 05:12.833
Who's that?

05:13.958 --> 05:14.833
Who is that?

05:14.916 --> 05:16.125
That's Ricardo.

05:18.083 --> 05:20.166
You scared me.
I thought that was you, Miguel.

05:22.958 --> 05:25.250
Miguel is like a father to me,

05:25.333 --> 05:26.791
so I won't hide the fact

05:26.875 --> 05:29.583
that I would've been a little upset.

05:30.125 --> 05:31.875
Okay. Who are you?

05:32.375 --> 05:33.625
Léonard.

05:33.708 --> 05:35.000
And what do you want?

05:35.083 --> 05:36.583
Do you want Pastraweed?

05:36.666 --> 05:37.958
No. Nothing special.

05:38.041 --> 05:41.125
They asked me to catch you.
I was paid for that.

05:41.708 --> 05:42.541
And…

05:43.541 --> 05:45.583
Ali? Where's Ali?

05:46.250 --> 05:47.458
Ali…

05:47.541 --> 05:50.375
All I can say about Ali is…

05:51.500 --> 05:52.791
I don't give a shit.

06:00.750 --> 06:02.000
That's really funny.

06:02.500 --> 06:06.583
I didn't see that one coming.

06:08.833 --> 06:10.250
That's a really good one.

06:10.333 --> 06:11.875
Laugh, damn it. Laugh.

06:12.666 --> 06:14.083
Let's make a connection.

06:17.666 --> 06:19.875
Let's go. Follow me. Come on.

06:19.958 --> 06:20.791
Yeah.

06:22.583 --> 06:25.000
You clean that up. It looks disgusting.

06:29.833 --> 06:33.916
So here it is. Get settled in.
I'll come back later.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.708
-Thank you so much.
-Yeah.

06:36.375 --> 06:37.208
All right.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.500
-This is a nightmare.
-Yeah, damn.

06:42.583 --> 06:44.375
What's with this crapper?

06:44.458 --> 06:46.333
The helicopter upset my stomach.

06:46.416 --> 06:49.416
Honestly, I can't take
a dump in front of you.

06:49.500 --> 06:52.833
Are you serious, Jo? Poop?
Can't you see we're in deep shit?

06:53.791 --> 06:54.625
Exactly.

06:54.708 --> 06:56.333
We're not in deep shit.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.875
We're here to make Pastraweed.
It's not complicated.

06:58.958 --> 07:02.458
What matters is we're together.
Together, we'll always get by.

07:02.541 --> 07:06.458
Grandma, it's too risky
to have you making Pastraweed again.

07:06.541 --> 07:08.625
-You're tired.
-No, I'm not.

07:08.708 --> 07:11.000
Let me negotiate with the guy.

07:11.083 --> 07:13.166
Negotiate? What do you want to negotiate?

07:13.250 --> 07:16.750
I don't know yet,
but I'm gonna try to get on his good side.

07:16.833 --> 07:18.750
-Oh yeah?
-You're all a pain in the ass.

07:18.833 --> 07:21.250
You left me like a dead dog on the road.

07:21.333 --> 07:22.666
Laugh at his jokes, damn it.

07:22.750 --> 07:26.541
You think you're gonna save us
if we laugh like idiots at his jokes?

07:26.625 --> 07:28.541
Yes, that's how it starts. Okay?

07:28.625 --> 07:31.083
If we want to get out of this,
we gotta befriend the guy.

07:31.166 --> 07:33.000
Plus, we're lucky. He's French.

07:33.083 --> 07:36.750
-We can form a connection.
-What are you talking about?

07:36.833 --> 07:40.333
He's sick. He just killed a guy
and you want to befriend him?

07:40.416 --> 07:41.833
Stop, damn it.

07:42.458 --> 07:44.541
We're just lost in the middle of nowhere.

07:45.583 --> 07:46.750
And maybe Ali

07:47.625 --> 07:48.833
is dead.

07:48.916 --> 07:50.458
Hold on. Slow down.

07:50.541 --> 07:54.041
They wouldn't kidnap him
in order to kill him for no reason.

07:54.125 --> 07:57.458
He's right. They wouldn't have
kidnapped him to kill him for no reason.

07:57.958 --> 08:00.416
So, stupid jokes aside,

08:00.500 --> 08:02.541
do you have a real idea
to get us out of this mess?

08:03.916 --> 08:05.833
There you go. So just shut up.

08:09.791 --> 08:10.666
Shit.

08:13.333 --> 08:14.250
Fuck.

08:15.500 --> 08:16.416
Facing north.

08:20.958 --> 08:21.833
Idiot.

08:42.625 --> 08:43.666
Whoa.

09:00.375 --> 09:01.208
Come on, go.

09:01.833 --> 09:03.000
Come on.

09:03.083 --> 09:03.916
Who's that?

09:08.333 --> 09:10.250
It's me. It's Joseph.

09:10.833 --> 09:12.041
You're not sleeping?

09:12.625 --> 09:13.458
No.

09:15.208 --> 09:16.750
I'm stretching my legs a little.

09:17.750 --> 09:19.916
-I feel lonely.
-Damn it.

09:20.625 --> 09:22.333
I don't want to burden you,

09:23.041 --> 09:24.333
but I feel lonely.

09:25.541 --> 09:26.458
Fuck!

09:35.000 --> 09:36.375
What's wrong, Dad?

09:39.208 --> 09:40.458
I miss her.

09:43.125 --> 09:44.708
I miss her too, you know.

09:46.750 --> 09:49.166
But I tell myself that from where she is,

09:50.500 --> 09:51.875
Mom's watching over us.

09:54.708 --> 09:56.833
Son, I'm talking about Catherine.

09:56.916 --> 09:58.916
Oh, all right. Okay. Wow.

09:59.583 --> 10:01.791
Great. Well, I don't miss her at all.

10:03.875 --> 10:04.708
But you know…

10:04.791 --> 10:06.250
How can I say this?

10:08.750 --> 10:10.750
When a summer fling ends,

10:11.833 --> 10:13.833
at first, you think you won't get over it.

10:13.916 --> 10:18.375
-You always get the feeling--
-Summer fling? What do you mean?

10:18.875 --> 10:20.791
We've been through
so many wonderful things.

10:20.875 --> 10:22.416
-Of course.
-With Catherine.

10:22.500 --> 10:24.500
Really. We love each other a lot.

10:24.583 --> 10:25.708
That's great.

10:25.791 --> 10:28.708
She took a lot of risks for us
when she replaced Jaurès.

10:28.791 --> 10:31.000
-Yeah, that does matter.
-Yeah.

10:31.083 --> 10:33.375
Our relationship is solid. Trust me.

10:33.958 --> 10:36.083
-Of course it is.
-What?

10:36.166 --> 10:39.125
It's solid,
but it's only been a few months.

10:39.208 --> 10:41.083
-So?
-Put that into perspective.

10:41.166 --> 10:42.625
Time has nothing--

10:43.250 --> 10:44.458
Let's go. It's time.

10:44.541 --> 10:45.750
Damn it!

10:45.833 --> 10:48.625
Pull up your panties, Grandma,
before I get turned on.

10:49.125 --> 10:51.666
Come with me.
I'm gonna introduce you to the new owner.

10:57.125 --> 10:57.958
So…

10:59.083 --> 11:01.458
Mr. Guzman is here

11:01.541 --> 11:03.833
in his little chariot.

11:04.541 --> 11:07.458
He's the head
of one of Colombia's biggest cartels.

11:07.541 --> 11:11.166
Okay, and you're gonna make
Pastraweed with him

11:11.250 --> 11:12.750
at scale.

11:26.166 --> 11:27.208
Señor Guzman…

11:32.625 --> 11:33.750
Say it in French.

11:33.833 --> 11:35.333
Let me do it.

11:38.166 --> 11:39.208
Tranquilo.

11:40.041 --> 11:40.958
Thirty kilos?

11:42.791 --> 11:45.125
Well, no problem.

11:45.208 --> 11:47.666
We'll see
about the quantities a little later,

11:47.750 --> 11:49.583
but honestly, 30 kilos isn't--

11:49.666 --> 11:50.875
He said tranquilo.

11:50.958 --> 11:52.208
What? Tranquilo?

11:53.458 --> 11:55.375
-Oh, tranquilo, like relax?
-Yes.

11:55.458 --> 11:57.916
Okay, got it. Sorry. My bad.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.250
We already started off
with misunderstandings.

12:02.916 --> 12:04.500
-In French.
-Yeah, in French.

12:04.583 --> 12:06.333
Are you the translator?

12:06.416 --> 12:08.666
I'll speak French.
It'll be easier for everyone.

12:09.458 --> 12:11.083
What I want to say is,

12:11.791 --> 12:13.000
in this family,

12:13.833 --> 12:17.291
there's only one person
who knows how to make Pastraweed.

12:17.375 --> 12:18.208
Yeah.

12:18.291 --> 12:20.791
There you go. And that person is me.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.666
Me. I know how to make Pastraweed.

12:23.750 --> 12:25.166
-Joseph--
-Allow me.

12:25.250 --> 12:27.958
-Them, they're all worthless, okay?
-Joseph.

12:31.625 --> 12:34.000
But what you did was take everyone,

12:34.083 --> 12:36.791
even though you only need one person.

12:37.791 --> 12:42.208
It's just like what happens
when we shop online.

12:45.791 --> 12:48.791
When you shop online,
you get carried away.

12:48.875 --> 12:52.041
Initially, you go on for one thing,
and you end up with 1,000.

12:52.125 --> 12:56.666
And if there's a Black Friday sale
mixed in with the mess, it's over.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.458
So you should keep who you need, me,

13:03.541 --> 13:07.083
and everyone else
you should return to sender.

13:07.166 --> 13:09.666
Shipping's on us.
We'd be happy to do that.

13:10.833 --> 13:13.708
Wouldn't we?
Fuck, you guys are breaking my balls.

13:24.833 --> 13:26.583
-He says okay.
-I only caught the end.

13:26.666 --> 13:27.916
But if you're lying,

13:28.000 --> 13:33.500
you'll all be transformed
into spicy peppers with meat.

13:33.583 --> 13:35.291
What does he mean, with meat?

13:35.375 --> 13:37.541
It's chili con carne, idiot.

13:37.625 --> 13:40.458
-It's a metaphor.
-He's right.

13:41.208 --> 13:43.875
There's only one person here
who knows how to make Pastraweed.

13:44.583 --> 13:47.166
-It's not him, though. It's me.
-Please.

13:47.250 --> 13:49.208
-Let me handle it.
-Wait a second, kids.

13:49.291 --> 13:51.125
-Dad.
-That's really cute.

13:51.208 --> 13:53.750
You're all trying to protect me. So cute.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.583
But, signoro…

14:01.291 --> 14:04.541
The only person here
who makes really good Pastraweed is…

14:04.625 --> 14:05.541
Whoa.

14:06.375 --> 14:07.666
…is Ludmila.

14:08.166 --> 14:09.916
Honestly, it's Ludmila.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.041
And it's… like that.

14:12.125 --> 14:13.750
-Well, there you go.
-Fuck.

14:13.833 --> 14:15.125
That's what I've been saying.

14:18.458 --> 14:21.750
And now he just asked me to shut up.

14:21.833 --> 14:23.625
Yeah, we agree. Shut up.

14:23.708 --> 14:25.541
Yeah, shut the hell up.

14:30.583 --> 14:32.416
No!

14:32.500 --> 14:34.333
-No, wait!
-Take me!

14:34.416 --> 14:36.500
-She doesn't know how to do anything.
-Guzman!

14:37.625 --> 14:40.541
If you want your Pastraweed,
I have one condition.

14:41.166 --> 14:44.375
I want you to guarantee
my family stays safe and sound.

15:00.166 --> 15:01.458
Again? He already said that.

15:01.541 --> 15:03.458
If your harvest is good,

15:03.541 --> 15:06.666
you'll all celebrate Passover together
in three months.

15:06.750 --> 15:10.958
If not, you'll all be
spicy peppers with meat.

15:13.166 --> 15:16.916
And you don't touch
a single hair on their heads.

15:20.291 --> 15:22.333
-Grandma.
-You don't have to go.

15:22.416 --> 15:24.750
Please stop crying right now, honey.

15:24.833 --> 15:26.166
You're gonna jinx me.

15:26.250 --> 15:28.041
There, there. I'll do what I have to.

15:28.833 --> 15:32.458
And then in three months,
we'll all be together, my bubbelehs.

15:32.541 --> 15:33.625
Don't worry.

15:33.708 --> 15:35.291
Look after these assholes.

15:36.375 --> 15:38.541
You're the only one
with your head on your shoulders.

15:40.250 --> 15:42.666
-Let's go. ¡Vamos!
-No.

15:44.083 --> 15:45.000
Fuck.

15:58.208 --> 15:59.375
Fuck!

16:02.416 --> 16:03.375
Hey!

16:04.083 --> 16:06.666
I never could stand you,
you big fat whore!

16:06.750 --> 16:08.583
I always knew you were a crook!

16:09.083 --> 16:11.416
Why weren't you here earlier?

16:12.000 --> 16:14.500
You don't have the balls
to tell Gérard the truth, do you?

16:14.583 --> 16:15.958
Take her away.

16:16.583 --> 16:17.708
Fuck you, bitch!

16:18.333 --> 16:20.583
Fucking bastard. Bitch.

16:22.291 --> 16:23.125
Dumb whore.

16:23.791 --> 16:26.416
That woman…
Wait till I get my hands on you.

16:32.666 --> 16:34.791
Why did the grandmother say that?

16:34.875 --> 16:36.583
What are you talking about?

16:37.375 --> 16:39.000
Are you in love with the old man?

16:39.083 --> 16:40.708
Don't confuse things.

16:40.791 --> 16:42.791
I did what I had to. That's all.

16:44.125 --> 16:45.583
What did you have to do?

16:45.666 --> 16:47.583
Did you do what you had to
with Guzman too?

16:48.375 --> 16:51.041
He's treating us like hobos.

16:51.125 --> 16:53.500
What are we gonna do
with those Hazan assholes?

16:53.583 --> 16:55.500
-This wasn't planned.
-It's okay.

16:55.583 --> 16:57.666
We have to keep them here
for three months. We can.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.041
That wasn't the deal!

16:59.125 --> 17:01.750
That costs money. That's riskier.

17:01.833 --> 17:04.291
He's scamming us like we're rookies!

17:04.375 --> 17:05.750
-Léonard.
-Fuck.

17:05.833 --> 17:07.000
Calm down.

17:07.083 --> 17:08.375
You see what you're doing?

17:08.458 --> 17:10.541
You say you'll let me handle it.

17:10.625 --> 17:12.416
Then you stick your nose
into my negotiations.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.416
You agree to everything.
You're a pain in the ass.

17:14.500 --> 17:16.250
-Excuse me?
-You're a pain in the ass!

17:17.208 --> 17:18.875
Is that how you talk to your mother?

17:21.375 --> 17:22.958
Now, shut the fuck up.

17:23.583 --> 17:25.000
I'm the boss here.

17:28.666 --> 17:31.375
Sorry. You don't need
to talk like that either.

17:31.458 --> 17:33.333
Anyway, we need to find something.

17:33.916 --> 17:34.791
What for?

17:35.791 --> 17:37.166
Well, to offset the cost.

17:41.916 --> 17:44.000
Couldn't you just
shut your mouth for once?

17:44.666 --> 17:46.166
We would've stayed together.

17:46.250 --> 17:47.666
I know. I fucked up.

17:47.750 --> 17:49.541
I don't know what came over me, Aure.

17:49.625 --> 17:52.375
I wanted to save Grandma.
I wanted to save you.

17:52.458 --> 17:55.208
You'll never save anyone. Fuck.
Don't you get it?

17:55.916 --> 17:57.583
Stop thinking you're a genius.

17:58.625 --> 18:00.833
Just 'cause Mom always said so
doesn't make it true.

18:00.916 --> 18:02.125
Aure, that's enough.

18:02.208 --> 18:03.958
That's a dumb thing to say.

18:04.041 --> 18:07.000
-That's dumb.
-That's true. We need to calm down.

18:07.083 --> 18:08.333
If we're careful

18:09.000 --> 18:10.916
and they don't fuck us over
like Jaurès did,

18:11.000 --> 18:13.166
in three months,
we'll get out of here and find Ludmila.

18:13.250 --> 18:15.583
Yes, of course,
if she doesn't lose it again

18:15.666 --> 18:17.125
and mess up the harvest.

18:17.208 --> 18:18.458
-Dad, please.
-What?

18:19.000 --> 18:23.041
We don't need to worry about Grandma.
She's gonna get it done.

18:23.125 --> 18:24.416
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

18:24.500 --> 18:26.333
And it's not Jaurès now.

18:26.416 --> 18:28.791
It's the cartel. The cartel is straight.

18:28.875 --> 18:31.541
In fact, "cartel"
means "straight" in Spanish.

18:32.041 --> 18:33.083
-Oh yeah?
-Of course.

18:33.166 --> 18:34.125
No.

18:34.708 --> 18:36.375
-It means poster.
-Okay, listen.

18:36.458 --> 18:37.541
There are several dialects.

18:37.625 --> 18:40.125
I don't even know anyone
who knows what cartel means.

18:40.208 --> 18:41.041
-Okay?
-Okay.

18:41.125 --> 18:45.458
What I'm saying is at Grandma's age,
you rot in a nursing home,

18:45.541 --> 18:47.416
eating soup,

18:47.500 --> 18:50.000
and usually,
they don't even put croutons in it.

18:51.958 --> 18:53.333
'Cause of their teeth.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.666
But, damn, she's off
on a mission for Escobar.

18:58.083 --> 19:01.875
Honestly,
what a great way to end your career.

19:05.875 --> 19:06.875
What's going on?

19:08.708 --> 19:09.541
What?

19:09.625 --> 19:10.583
Medical visit.

19:10.666 --> 19:11.625
-What?
-Medical visit?

19:11.708 --> 19:12.541
Come on. Let's go.

19:12.625 --> 19:14.833
No, I'm fine.

19:14.916 --> 19:17.291
It's okay, Dad.
Please don't rock the boat.

19:17.375 --> 19:19.750
-No, but we're both fine.
-Dad…

19:25.791 --> 19:27.708
Did he say "America visit"?

19:28.583 --> 19:30.791
-America visit?
-Medical visit.

19:31.541 --> 19:34.708
You think they're gonna
visit national parks?

19:34.791 --> 19:36.541
I don't know. I heard "America visit."

19:36.625 --> 19:39.333
I thought since we're in South America,
they'd visit America.

19:39.416 --> 19:42.666
Bro, you don't take hostages
on a tour across South America.

19:42.750 --> 19:45.041
-That doesn't happen.
-Yeah, but he said, "America visit."

19:45.125 --> 19:45.958
Stop it.

19:46.041 --> 19:48.458
Medical! Medical visit!

19:48.541 --> 19:49.500
Of course.

19:50.916 --> 19:52.583
We just went to see the prosecutor,

19:52.666 --> 19:57.791
and unfortunately, the authorities don't
consider the Hazans a priority, so--

19:57.875 --> 19:59.000
That's great.

19:59.083 --> 20:02.541
But Olivier isn't my problem anymore.

20:02.625 --> 20:04.458
I'm building a life for myself.

20:04.541 --> 20:05.875
A wonderful life

20:05.958 --> 20:07.583
with my sweet Olivio.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.291
They have almost the same name. Crazy.

20:11.375 --> 20:12.833
Actually, I'm Franck.

20:13.958 --> 20:17.708
Olivio, let me do the talking.
You know I hate being interrupted.

20:17.791 --> 20:19.583
I don't like that.

20:23.708 --> 20:26.583
Okay, so as I was saying,

20:26.666 --> 20:29.500
we need someone higher up

20:29.583 --> 20:31.583
to do something for the Hazans.

20:31.666 --> 20:34.000
Yeah, 'cause they're not fugitives.
They're hostages.

20:34.083 --> 20:36.125
I'm not the right person. No.

20:36.666 --> 20:38.333
All that bullshit is behind me now.

20:38.833 --> 20:41.250
Yes, we know, but…

20:41.333 --> 20:44.791
We thought you could give us your father's
contact info since he was in government--

20:44.875 --> 20:48.000
I can't go with you.
I'm too old for all that bullshit.

20:48.083 --> 20:50.791
Right. We don't want you to come with us.

20:50.875 --> 20:52.500
We just want to contact your father.

20:52.583 --> 20:54.166
Come on. Stop insisting!

20:54.250 --> 20:56.833
If I go with you,
shit will hit the fan for sure.

20:56.916 --> 20:58.333
I guarantee it.

20:58.416 --> 20:59.541
Come on.

20:59.625 --> 21:03.333
She said we don't want you to come.
We just want his contact info. Got it?

21:06.708 --> 21:07.791
You guys are good.

21:09.541 --> 21:11.833
You guys are really good. Damn.
Well played. I'm in.

21:11.916 --> 21:13.041
Let's go. Olivio?

21:14.166 --> 21:17.375
I won't be able to give you
the attention you deserve 'cause of this.

21:17.458 --> 21:20.000
-But, my love--
-Franck, I can't believe it!

21:20.500 --> 21:22.166
Can't you see this is complicated enough?

21:24.541 --> 21:25.958
I'm gonna miss you.

21:30.166 --> 21:33.125
Pack up all your stuff. I want
everything gone when I get back.

21:35.583 --> 21:38.125
I'm gonna put some garments on.
Will you wait for me here?

21:38.208 --> 21:39.791
We've got a lot on our plate.

21:45.166 --> 21:47.083
So far from you

21:47.166 --> 21:49.333
I'm so lonely

21:49.416 --> 21:51.875
I miss you

21:51.958 --> 21:52.875
Mom…

21:52.958 --> 21:53.791
Fuck.

21:53.875 --> 21:54.958
So far from you--

21:55.041 --> 22:00.000
Bro, I'm begging you. Sing something else.
That song depresses me. I can't go.

22:00.083 --> 22:01.791
You're so difficult! You asked me.

22:01.875 --> 22:03.875
That's me and Clémentine's song.
I really miss her.

22:03.958 --> 22:05.166
-I'm singing that.
-Turn around.

22:05.250 --> 22:07.416
Okay. You're such a pain.
I'm not a jukebox.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.333
I get it, but sing me something festive

22:09.416 --> 22:12.416
that'll make my poop want
to come out and party. I'm begging you.

22:12.500 --> 22:14.500
Party, all right. That I can do.

22:14.583 --> 22:16.333
Go on. Now's the time.

22:16.416 --> 22:19.333
Oh, how we're squished
At the bottom of this can

22:19.416 --> 22:22.208
Sing the sardines, sing the sardines

22:22.291 --> 22:23.291
Go. It's working, bro.

22:23.375 --> 22:25.875
Oh, how we're squished
At the bottom of this can

22:25.958 --> 22:27.083
Sing the sardines

22:28.458 --> 22:29.416
Fuck.

22:29.500 --> 22:30.375
Well?

22:31.250 --> 22:32.500
How did it go?

22:34.500 --> 22:35.958
Hold on. What's with that look?

22:36.541 --> 22:37.875
What did they do to you?

22:37.958 --> 22:39.583
We had a full check-up.

22:40.333 --> 22:43.916
We did a stress test
and then they did a quick examination.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.625
"Quick."

22:45.708 --> 22:48.916
The guy fingered my ass
for five minutes. "Quick."

22:49.000 --> 22:50.875
Dad, it was a medical exam.

22:50.958 --> 22:52.583
That idiot was looking for my prostate.

22:52.666 --> 22:55.625
I told him three times
I didn't have it anymore and…

22:56.125 --> 22:58.791
Okay, and what else?

22:58.875 --> 23:00.500
Nothing. They gave us these new clothes.

23:00.583 --> 23:01.708
I see that.

23:01.791 --> 23:04.041
And the doctor wrote everything down
in a little notebook.

23:04.833 --> 23:07.708
And they gave me medication
for high blood pressure.

23:07.791 --> 23:10.583
-Honestly, they were right.
-Yeah, that was nice.

23:10.666 --> 23:12.083
-Honestly, good.
-Yeah.

23:12.750 --> 23:14.041
Damn, that's weird.

23:14.125 --> 23:15.958
That doesn't make any sense.

23:16.041 --> 23:18.541
Tests, fingering… What's going on?

23:18.625 --> 23:21.083
-That's weird, isn't it?
-Yeah, super weird.

23:21.166 --> 23:22.333
Nothing's weird about it.

23:22.416 --> 23:25.583
Guzman pressured them.
They want us to be healthy. That's all.

23:25.666 --> 23:27.625
Maybe they want to make us work too.

23:28.333 --> 23:31.791
We gotta get that notebook you mentioned
and see what they wrote.

23:31.875 --> 23:33.500
-Yeah, you're right.
-No!

23:33.583 --> 23:35.166
-Yes, we need to clear this up.
-No!

23:35.250 --> 23:37.583
If you get caught, we'll be in deep shit.

23:37.666 --> 23:38.583
Grandma too.

23:39.250 --> 23:40.875
So don't do anything. Got it?

23:43.708 --> 23:44.541
What?

23:44.625 --> 23:46.500
-Did you hear your sister?
-Of course I did.

23:46.583 --> 23:48.125
-Well?
-Well, we're not gonna do it.

23:48.625 --> 23:50.708
-We're not gonna.
-Thanks.

23:52.875 --> 23:54.500
I'm beat. Damn.

23:55.958 --> 23:57.041
We're gonna do it.

23:57.125 --> 23:59.041
We need to find a way
to get that notebook.

24:00.958 --> 24:03.750
Did your parents suffer
from a chronic disease

24:03.833 --> 24:06.458
like diabetes, cholesterol,
high blood pressure?

24:06.541 --> 24:08.750
I don't know. I didn't know them.

24:09.541 --> 24:11.500
They actually died when I was little.

24:11.583 --> 24:13.083
From what?

24:13.166 --> 24:15.166
My mother was in a car accident

24:15.875 --> 24:18.791
and my father died from fibromyalgia.

24:18.875 --> 24:19.750
A shame.

24:19.833 --> 24:20.958
That's not possible.

24:21.833 --> 24:24.708
That's a sickness that causes
sleep problems. It's never killed anyone.

24:25.458 --> 24:27.000
Sure, that's what I was always told.

24:27.083 --> 24:29.333
I'm telling you
that's not possible. May I?

24:30.583 --> 24:33.208
Then again,
I was really young when he died.

24:34.458 --> 24:36.125
I don't know much about him.

24:44.916 --> 24:46.458
-Are you okay?
-Not at all.

24:48.208 --> 24:50.458
It's really hard to talk about my father.

24:55.666 --> 24:58.208
Oh my God, he's crying.

24:59.875 --> 25:02.375
Do you know what it's like
not knowing your father?

25:03.125 --> 25:05.083
They never gave a shit about me.

25:05.166 --> 25:07.500
I swear, they didn't give a shit.

25:07.583 --> 25:10.416
You know what they gave me at
the children's home for my 10th birthday?

25:10.916 --> 25:11.875
Batteries!

25:11.958 --> 25:14.416
I swear on my dead mother's life.

25:15.250 --> 25:16.666
Batteries!

25:16.750 --> 25:18.666
AAs! You hear me, damn it?

25:18.750 --> 25:20.833
I didn't even have any toys
to put them in.

25:20.916 --> 25:22.000
-Gertrude.
-Get it?

25:22.083 --> 25:25.833
I'm talking about fucking batteries.

25:25.916 --> 25:28.125
They never gave a shit about me!

25:28.208 --> 25:29.416
Fucking batteries!

25:31.291 --> 25:33.000
I'm not a psychotherapist.

25:33.458 --> 25:34.750
That's enough. Get it together.

25:35.791 --> 25:37.375
Whoa, damn!

25:38.708 --> 25:39.583
Fuck!

25:42.875 --> 25:44.000
I think I actually

25:44.666 --> 25:45.916
fainted just now.

25:49.875 --> 25:50.791
I feel better.

25:56.166 --> 25:57.375
I feel better.

25:59.458 --> 26:02.333
-Did you tell them we're coming with you?
-No, don't worry.

26:02.416 --> 26:04.416
It might not be ideal
if we're not welcome.

26:04.500 --> 26:05.708
Oh, my God, you're so annoying.

26:05.791 --> 26:09.333
Everyone we're interested in will be here,
the minister of justice, the police chief…

26:09.416 --> 26:12.291
So behave yourselves and don't act crazy,
especially you, Aïda,

26:12.375 --> 26:13.541
and it'll be fine.

26:13.625 --> 26:16.375
Okay, will you introduce me to one of them
and let me handle the rest?

26:16.458 --> 26:17.916
Yes, I'm not stupid.

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
I can't stay out too late.
William is home alone with the triplets.

26:21.083 --> 26:23.750
Who cares about William?
Are you paying him per hour?

26:23.833 --> 26:25.625
What did you say about William?
Are you insane?

26:25.708 --> 26:28.666
-You mentioned William!
-That's enough, you two!

26:29.833 --> 26:32.000
-But she--
-I've had it, Youssef!

26:32.583 --> 26:34.000
Not another word from you!

26:35.375 --> 26:36.583
I'm fed up!

26:36.666 --> 26:37.583
We're here!

26:39.708 --> 26:40.625
God.

26:42.541 --> 26:43.583
It's always me.

26:43.666 --> 26:44.833
Good evening.

26:44.916 --> 26:46.541
It's down the hall on your right.

26:47.125 --> 26:48.666
-Thank you.
-Have a good evening.

26:49.708 --> 26:50.875
Careful with the hat.

26:54.416 --> 26:55.750
This is great!

26:58.166 --> 26:59.166
What is this?

26:59.750 --> 27:01.291
Thank you very much.

27:01.375 --> 27:03.000
Here. Put these on.

27:06.208 --> 27:08.583
Damn it, Clémentine. We can't stay here.

27:08.666 --> 27:10.375
You said this was a dinner. What is this?

27:11.500 --> 27:13.291
I didn't know. I swear.

27:13.375 --> 27:15.875
But this is even better.
It's the perfect atmosphere.

27:15.958 --> 27:18.375
This is the kind of situation
where anything goes.

27:19.416 --> 27:21.500
Come with me. They must be in the back.

27:23.708 --> 27:24.666
That's good, big boy.

27:25.166 --> 27:26.000
Perfect.

27:26.083 --> 27:28.083
-Youssef.
-Yes. Hello.

27:34.208 --> 27:35.625
Hi. How are you?

27:36.750 --> 27:39.250
Really good and you?

27:40.250 --> 27:41.166
Okay.

27:41.250 --> 27:42.791
Dad, can you stop for a second?

27:42.875 --> 27:44.375
-I'm trying to say hi to her.
-What?

27:45.750 --> 27:46.583
Right.

27:46.666 --> 27:47.500
Thanks.

27:47.583 --> 27:49.291
I can't believe it. How are you, darling?

27:49.375 --> 27:51.208
-How are you doing?
-Fine.

27:51.291 --> 27:52.875
-Fine?
-As you can see.

27:52.958 --> 27:55.583
-You look good.
-I went on vacation.

27:55.666 --> 27:57.000
-Really?
-Yeah.

27:57.083 --> 27:59.166
-It's really important to clear your head.
-Yeah.

27:59.250 --> 28:00.791
Get out of work mode.

28:01.750 --> 28:03.083
That's wonderful.

28:03.166 --> 28:04.375
Is Frédérique around?

28:04.458 --> 28:06.250
Yeah, I saw her in the back bedroom.

28:06.333 --> 28:07.708
Okay, thanks.

28:08.416 --> 28:10.416
Come, I'll introduce you
to the chief of police.

28:12.500 --> 28:16.250
-Hey, beautiful bird of paradise.
-Come here.

28:16.333 --> 28:18.083
Where are you going like that?

28:18.958 --> 28:21.000
We're really not close to catching them.

28:21.083 --> 28:22.875
We're trying to penetrate this case.

28:24.125 --> 28:25.333
I want to believe you.

28:26.458 --> 28:29.125
But you should know
the Cavillans took them.

28:29.208 --> 28:30.833
They didn't want to escape.

28:31.375 --> 28:34.500
Damn, if the Cavillans did this,

28:34.583 --> 28:35.916
they're in deep shit.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
I know.

28:37.083 --> 28:39.666
That's why we need to launch
a rescue operation right away.

28:39.750 --> 28:41.208
That's not up to me.

28:42.000 --> 28:42.916
Fuck.

28:43.625 --> 28:45.833
I just talked
to the secretary of the interior.

28:45.916 --> 28:47.666
-I'm bummed.
-Why?

28:47.750 --> 28:51.250
He said he won't lift a finger
until he knows where the Hazans are.

28:51.833 --> 28:52.666
Fuck.

28:53.583 --> 28:54.416
Yeah.

28:57.041 --> 28:58.208
Where's your brother?

28:59.541 --> 29:00.458
I don't know.

29:02.083 --> 29:04.583
That little piggy must be having a blast.

29:04.666 --> 29:06.416
Whose ganache is this?

29:06.500 --> 29:08.750
-Uncle Youssef's!
-That's right.

29:08.833 --> 29:11.500
You just gotta whip it hard.
That's Uncle Youssef's secret.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.000
This is my sister, Aïda.

29:13.083 --> 29:16.041
Aïda, this is Claudine and Huguette.
They're so cute. They're my friends.

29:16.125 --> 29:18.125
I was just showing them…
Who wants a taste, girls?

29:18.208 --> 29:19.916
-I do.
-Yeah? All right.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.875
Stop with your bullshit. Let's go.
Where are the changing rooms?

29:23.666 --> 29:26.083
-Done.
-Until next time, Huguette.

29:26.166 --> 29:29.000
Come by the chocolate shop, okay?
Take care, girls.

29:29.083 --> 29:30.500
Come on. Let's go.

29:32.916 --> 29:36.000
I swear. If you sleep at home,
you'll feel better in the morning.

29:36.083 --> 29:37.583
No, I swear…

29:37.666 --> 29:39.541
I feel really good. I can get home.

29:39.625 --> 29:40.916
Yes, of course.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.875
-Fuck.
-Fuck.

29:48.833 --> 29:49.708
Fuck!

29:50.250 --> 29:51.500
-Ali?
-What?

29:51.583 --> 29:53.500
What are you doing in Aïda's garbage, bro?

29:53.583 --> 29:55.250
-Hold on.
-What?

29:55.333 --> 29:57.291
I'm hiding here. I'm in hiding.

29:57.875 --> 30:00.291
I knew he was alive. I knew it.

30:00.375 --> 30:02.583
-Are the others in Paris too?
-No.

30:03.166 --> 30:06.208
They put us on a plane.
And I managed to escape.

30:06.291 --> 30:08.291
I ran like crazy while they were shooting.

30:08.375 --> 30:11.000
I zigzagged and dodged the bullets.

30:11.666 --> 30:12.541
Damn.

30:12.625 --> 30:13.958
Did they kill you?

30:14.041 --> 30:14.916
What?

30:16.625 --> 30:17.583
No.

30:17.666 --> 30:20.083
You scared me. He scared me.

30:20.166 --> 30:22.708
Anyway, if they put them on a plane,
that's good news.

30:22.791 --> 30:24.875
Yeah, true. They're gonna earn miles.

30:24.958 --> 30:27.708
No, that means they didn't want
to kill them. Otherwise they would've.

30:27.791 --> 30:30.333
-Where's this plane?
-I don't know.

30:32.416 --> 30:33.333
I don't know.

30:34.333 --> 30:38.000
No, a medical exam, just like you.

30:38.583 --> 30:41.000
However, the stress test was a pain.

30:41.708 --> 30:44.000
-Other than that, nothing more to say.
-Yeah?

30:45.125 --> 30:47.041
There you go. Well, see you.

30:47.125 --> 30:48.458
Come on. Get the notebook out.

30:54.041 --> 30:55.958
-Hold on, nothing's there.
-What?

30:56.041 --> 30:57.666
Did he rip out the pages? Fuck.

30:57.750 --> 31:00.458
-Damn it! You stole the notebook.
-What?

31:00.541 --> 31:02.333
Do you ever listen?

31:03.125 --> 31:05.916
-You're real idiots.
-Well, we're not just gonna sit around.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.125
Yes, we are. We said not to rock the boat
for three months. Shit!

31:09.208 --> 31:10.958
Well, what's in the notebook?

31:11.916 --> 31:12.750
Nothing.

31:12.833 --> 31:15.500
Nothing?
Great, all that for nothing. Well done.

31:15.583 --> 31:16.958
Come on. Show me.

31:17.041 --> 31:19.625
-Fuck.
-Be careful. I have to put it back.

31:19.708 --> 31:21.041
Calm down, honey.

31:23.166 --> 31:25.333
-Damn, there's something there.
-What?

31:25.833 --> 31:27.291
What? We don't see anything.

31:37.791 --> 31:38.791
Fuck.

31:42.541 --> 31:45.166
-Is that from Daft Punk?
-No, it's in German.

31:46.916 --> 31:49.541
-There are your names.
-What?

31:50.125 --> 31:52.625
"Gérard…"
And there are prices next to them.

31:52.708 --> 31:55.333
-Why are there prices?
-That doesn't seem good.

31:56.750 --> 32:00.666
Hold on. "Leber" sounds
like Grandma's dish "gehakte Leber."

32:00.750 --> 32:02.458
-That's Yiddish.
-What does it mean?

32:02.541 --> 32:04.291
-It's…
-It's chopped liver.

32:04.375 --> 32:05.333
Yeah, it's gross.

32:05.416 --> 32:06.625
-No, it's not.
-It is.

32:09.208 --> 32:10.208
Hold on. "Leber…"

32:10.791 --> 32:12.750
-That means liver in German.
-Yeah.

32:14.416 --> 32:16.000
Fuck, they want our organs.

33:19.458 --> 33:21.583
