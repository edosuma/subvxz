07:50.553 --> 07:53.432

07:53.473 --> 07:55.475

07:55.516 --> 07:57.978
then I should just skip it.

I-I didn't mean, "don't go

07:59.646 --> 08:01.398
to the club skip it."

08:01.440 --> 08:03.400
I meant, you know,

08:01.440 --> 08:03.400
"skip the argument, skip it."

08:03.442 --> 08:04.818
Oh, I see-I see.

08:04.859 --> 08:06.153
So you didn't really mean it

08:04.859 --> 08:06.153
when you said

08:06.194 --> 08:07.487
you were never

08:06.194 --> 08:07.487
gonna go riding again?

08:07.528 --> 08:08.947
Oh, no!

08:07.528 --> 08:08.947
I meant that.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.573
- Oh, really?

08:08.989 --> 08:10.573
- Yeah.

08:10.615 --> 08:11.992
But why don't you wanna

08:10.615 --> 08:11.992
come to the club?

08:12.033 --> 08:13.576
Oh, because you play

08:12.033 --> 08:13.576
the same songs

08:13.618 --> 08:15.954
three sets a night three nights

08:13.618 --> 08:15.954
a week. Right, Joey?

08:15.996 --> 08:18.415
Hey, come on, the Smash Club

08:15.996 --> 08:18.415
is fun. Right, Joey?

08:18.457 --> 08:20.208
Fun? It's loud.

08:18.457 --> 08:20.208
It's smoky.

08:20.250 --> 08:23.337
Oh, and, of course, they keep

08:20.250 --> 08:23.337
that ladies' room immaculate!

08:23.378 --> 08:24.712
Tell her she's wrong

08:23.378 --> 08:24.712
about the ladies' room.

08:24.754 --> 08:26.756
Tell him I'm right

08:24.754 --> 08:26.756
about the ladies' room.

08:26.798 --> 08:29.884
I think I better just

08:26.798 --> 08:29.884
stay out of the ladies room.

08:29.926 --> 08:31.219
Joey, can you believe

08:29.926 --> 08:31.219
that she's not going

08:31.261 --> 08:32.929
to the Smash Club tonight?

08:32.971 --> 08:35.056
- Becky, is that true?

08:32.971 --> 08:35.056
- Yes.

08:35.098 --> 08:38.101
- Well, then I believe it.

08:35.098 --> 08:38.101
- Go wash!

08:38.143 --> 08:40.228
(Michelle on walkie-talkie)

08:38.143 --> 08:40.228
'Hello, Uncle Jesse.'

08:40.270 --> 08:43.023
'It's me, Michelle Tanner.'

08:44.399 --> 08:47.944
Somebody probably wants

08:44.399 --> 08:47.944
to hear me sing.

08:47.986 --> 08:49.029
Coming, Michelle.

08:49.070 --> 08:50.197
Why do you men cling

08:50.238 --> 08:53.033
to your antiquated

08:50.238 --> 08:53.033
macho attitudes?

08:53.074 --> 08:56.411
Because we're tough

08:53.074 --> 08:56.411
and we're rugged.

08:56.453 --> 08:58.330
Now, take a hike, toots,

08:56.453 --> 08:58.330
so I can separate

08:58.372 --> 09:00.540
my wash and wears

08:58.372 --> 09:00.540
from my delicates.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.169
Yes, can I help you,

09:01.875 --> 09:04.169
young lady?

09:04.211 --> 09:06.129
- A kiss, please?

09:04.211 --> 09:06.129
- Oh!

09:06.171 --> 09:07.255
Alright, upside-down kiss.

09:07.297 --> 09:08.798
Upside-down kiss.

09:10.717 --> 09:14.304
See, somebody

09:10.717 --> 09:14.304
still loves me.

09:14.346 --> 09:17.182
Michelle, can I talk to you?

09:17.224 --> 09:18.892
I'm a monkey.

09:18.933 --> 09:21.895
[mimicking a monkey]

09:21.936 --> 09:24.689
Can I tell you my problem first?

09:24.731 --> 09:27.275
Alright, listen to this.

09:27.317 --> 09:29.027
My toy.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.529
Oh, Michelle, now you

09:29.069 --> 09:30.529
don't wanna grow up

09:30.570 --> 09:32.739
and be selfish

09:30.570 --> 09:32.739
like Becky?

09:32.780 --> 09:34.449
(Jesse on walkie-talkie)

09:32.780 --> 09:34.449
'And the next thing you know,

09:32.780 --> 09:34.449
you won't wanna go'

09:34.491 --> 09:36.368
'hear your boyfriend sing.'

09:36.410 --> 09:37.869
'I don't know what's got

09:36.410 --> 09:37.869
into Becky lately'

09:37.911 --> 09:40.955
'but she's really starting

09:37.911 --> 09:40.955
to get on my nerves.'

09:40.997 --> 09:42.707
After seven, already?

09:42.749 --> 09:45.293
I better check

09:42.749 --> 09:45.293
that garbage disposal.

09:45.335 --> 09:46.669
[machine whirring]

09:48.796 --> 09:52.926
(Jesse)

09:48.796 --> 09:52.926
'I mean, sometimes she gets

09:48.796 --> 09:52.926
so stubborn and pig-headed..'

09:52.967 --> 09:55.387
Excuse me.

09:55.429 --> 09:57.972
You know, sometimes those things

09:55.429 --> 09:57.972
pick up other people's houses!

10:00.350 --> 10:02.143
Oh, Michelle, why can't

10:00.350 --> 10:02.143
Becky just realize

10:02.185 --> 10:04.271
that your Uncle Jesse

10:02.185 --> 10:04.271
is right?

10:04.312 --> 10:06.398
I mean, it's so simple..

10:06.440 --> 10:08.316
It's so sim..

10:08.358 --> 10:10.193
Hi!

10:10.235 --> 10:13.447
Oh, you found the baby monitor,

10:10.235 --> 10:13.447
didn't you?

10:13.488 --> 10:15.532
Michelle, do that imitation

10:13.488 --> 10:15.532
of me again.

10:18.659 --> 10:20.370
I wanna talk to you, alone.

10:20.412 --> 10:21.662
Hey, anything you

10:20.412 --> 10:21.662
can say to me

10:21.704 --> 10:23.457
you can say

10:21.704 --> 10:23.457
in front of my niece.

10:23.498 --> 10:26.084
- No, that's not true.

10:23.498 --> 10:26.084
- You see what I'm saying?

10:26.126 --> 10:27.586
Here, hold this.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.088
- Becky?

10:27.627 --> 10:30.088
- Stubborn? Pig-headed?

10:30.130 --> 10:32.006
Well, it just so happens

10:30.130 --> 10:32.006
that this stubborn pig-head

10:32.048 --> 10:34.092
only goes to that

10:32.048 --> 10:34.092
club to be with<i> you!</i>

10:34.134 --> 10:35.427
Then why are we arguing?

10:34.134 --> 10:35.427
Let's go.

10:35.469 --> 10:36.677
No way!

10:36.719 --> 10:38.096
If you don't wanna do

10:36.719 --> 10:38.096
what I wanna do

10:38.138 --> 10:40.807
why should I do

10:38.138 --> 10:40.807
what you wanna do?

10:40.848 --> 10:43.268
Oh, I get. This whole thing

10:40.848 --> 10:43.268
is about revenge.

10:43.310 --> 10:44.811
You're punishing me.

10:44.852 --> 10:46.229
You don't wanna go to my club

10:44.852 --> 10:46.229
'cause I don't wanna

10:46.271 --> 10:47.855
ride your stupid horses,

10:46.271 --> 10:47.855
is that it?

10:47.897 --> 10:49.732
Oh, well, it just so happens

10:47.897 --> 10:49.732
that those stupid horses

10:49.774 --> 10:51.067
are a lot smarter

10:49.774 --> 10:51.067
than you.

10:51.109 --> 10:52.360
Just admit it.

10:51.109 --> 10:52.360
Say that I'm right.

10:52.402 --> 10:54.446
- Say I'm right.

10:52.402 --> 10:54.446
- Okay, I'm right.

10:54.488 --> 10:55.696
Funny.

10:55.738 --> 10:57.865
Don't you dare walk out

10:55.738 --> 10:57.865
that door.

10:57.907 --> 11:00.034
Don't you dare leave

10:57.907 --> 11:00.034
this hallway.

11:00.076 --> 11:01.453
I'm talking to you.

11:01.495 --> 11:03.079
Don't you dare take

11:01.495 --> 11:03.079
that step, or that step

11:03.121 --> 11:04.872
or that step,

11:03.121 --> 11:04.872
or that step.

11:04.914 --> 11:06.124
Okay, what do

11:04.914 --> 11:06.124
you wanna say?

11:06.166 --> 11:08.084
I just wanna tell

11:06.166 --> 11:08.084
you that, uh

11:08.126 --> 11:09.836
that-that this whole thing

11:08.126 --> 11:09.836
is your fault.

11:09.877 --> 11:11.754
- Oh-oh, my fault?

11:09.877 --> 11:11.754
- Yeah.

11:11.796 --> 11:14.549
Well, I disagree. But what else

11:11.796 --> 11:14.549
is new? We always disagree.

11:14.591 --> 11:15.842
We're completely

11:14.591 --> 11:15.842
different people with

11:15.883 --> 11:17.344
completely

11:15.883 --> 11:17.344
different interests.

11:17.385 --> 11:19.179
Fine, maybe we should

11:17.385 --> 11:19.179
start dating other people

11:19.220 --> 11:20.555
we have more

11:19.220 --> 11:20.555
in common with.

11:20.597 --> 11:21.848
Oh, so that's what you want?

11:21.889 --> 11:23.224
It's obviously what you want.

11:23.266 --> 11:24.851
Oh, well then fine!

11:23.266 --> 11:24.851
This relationship is over.

11:24.892 --> 11:27.228
- Goodbye, Jesse!

11:24.892 --> 11:27.228
- Fine, goodbye, Rebecca!

11:29.356 --> 11:31.608
[sighs]

11:31.650 --> 11:34.528
[instrumental music]

11:44.204 --> 11:45.704
[alarm clock buzzing]

11:47.499 --> 11:49.459
Alright, it's morning!

11:49.501 --> 11:53.046
I've been waiting<i> all night</i>

11:49.501 --> 11:53.046
for this.

11:53.087 --> 11:54.964
Stephanie, it's Saturday.

11:55.006 --> 11:57.342
It's also tooth fairy day.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.052
What did you do?

11:59.093 --> 12:00.970
Whoa, baby!

12:02.305 --> 12:04.516
You're whoa, babying about

12:02.305 --> 12:04.516
a dollar bill?

12:04.558 --> 12:07.894
Does<i> this</i> look like

12:04.558 --> 12:07.894
a dollar bill?

12:07.935 --> 12:10.271
Twenty dollars?

12:10.313 --> 12:12.607
Whoa, baby!

12:12.649 --> 12:16.444
I knew those milk

12:12.649 --> 12:16.444
and cookies would pay off.

12:16.486 --> 12:20.281
You nerd bomber. I ate

12:16.486 --> 12:20.281
the milk and cookies.

12:20.323 --> 12:22.367
You're in trouble

12:20.323 --> 12:22.367
this Christmas.

12:22.409 --> 12:26.413
The tooth fairy and Santa Claus

12:22.409 --> 12:26.413
are like this.

12:28.289 --> 12:30.208
I don't know, Jesse,

12:28.289 --> 12:30.208
maybe you'd feel a lot better

12:30.250 --> 12:32.627
if you just called Rebecca

12:30.250 --> 12:32.627
and apologized.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.629
Oh, Danny, I gotta face it.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.629
It ain't happening, man.

12:34.671 --> 12:36.297
We don't have one thing

12:34.671 --> 12:36.297
in common.

12:36.339 --> 12:38.299
- Oh, sure you do.

12:36.339 --> 12:38.299
- What's that?

12:38.341 --> 12:41.302
You're both crazy

12:38.341 --> 12:41.302
about me.

12:41.344 --> 12:42.387
Guess what?

12:42.429 --> 12:45.640
The tooth fairy left me $20!

12:45.682 --> 12:47.642
$20? Whoa, baby!

12:49.728 --> 12:51.187
This isn't fair, dad.

12:51.229 --> 12:52.313
How come the tooth fairy

12:51.229 --> 12:52.313
never left<i> me</i>

12:52.355 --> 12:54.274
that kind of cash?

12:54.315 --> 12:57.527
Well, possibly the tooth fairy

12:54.315 --> 12:57.527
was fumbling around in the dark

12:57.569 --> 12:59.738
and, uh, accidentally

12:57.569 --> 12:59.738
took the wrong bill

12:59.778 --> 13:02.781
out of his,

12:59.778 --> 13:02.781
or her, wallet.

13:02.823 --> 13:04.659
Well, I certainly hope

13:02.823 --> 13:04.659
the allowance fairy

13:04.701 --> 13:06.953
makes the same mistake.

13:06.994 --> 13:09.623
Alright, alright, everybody

13:06.994 --> 13:09.623
get your pancakes here.

13:09.664 --> 13:11.874
- Ooh!

13:09.664 --> 13:11.874
- Pancakes, alright.

13:11.916 --> 13:14.628
- My pancakes.

13:11.916 --> 13:14.628
- No, no, Michelle.

13:14.669 --> 13:16.713
Honey, those are

13:14.669 --> 13:16.713
for everybody.

13:16.755 --> 13:18.298
Why don't we all show Michelle

13:18.339 --> 13:20.300
how much fun sharing can be?

13:20.341 --> 13:22.343
- Good idea.

13:20.341 --> 13:22.343
- Excellent idea, Joey.

13:22.385 --> 13:23.928
Now, Michelle, watch this.

13:23.970 --> 13:26.847
I am going to share

13:23.970 --> 13:26.847
<i>my</i> pancake..

13:26.889 --> 13:28.224
...with Joey.

13:28.266 --> 13:30.769
Thank you, Danny,

13:28.266 --> 13:30.769
and I am going to share

13:30.809 --> 13:33.271
my pancake with D.J..

13:33.313 --> 13:34.855
How thoughtful!

13:34.897 --> 13:36.815
And I'm going to share

13:34.897 --> 13:36.815
my pancake

13:36.857 --> 13:40.528
with my incredibly fortunate

13:36.857 --> 13:40.528
little sister.

13:40.570 --> 13:43.657
You're too kind.

13:43.698 --> 13:47.034
And I'm happy to share

13:43.698 --> 13:47.034
with my Uncle Jesse.

13:47.076 --> 13:48.662
Thank you very much.

13:48.703 --> 13:51.247
And I'm going to share with

13:48.703 --> 13:51.247
one of my three favorite nieces

13:51.289 --> 13:53.207
Michelle. There you go.

13:53.249 --> 13:55.669
Now, isn't sharing fun,

13:53.249 --> 13:55.669
everybody?

13:55.710 --> 13:58.588
(all)

13:55.710 --> 13:58.588
Oh, yes!

13:58.630 --> 14:01.257
I wish someone would share

13:58.630 --> 14:01.257
their pancake with me!

14:05.303 --> 14:06.887
Here, daddy.

14:10.141 --> 14:11.726
Thank you, Michelle.

14:11.768 --> 14:14.437
I'm so proud of you.

14:14.479 --> 14:16.564
And I won't even

14:14.479 --> 14:16.564
have to chew it.

14:18.483 --> 14:19.859
[knock on the door]

14:19.900 --> 14:21.152
It's Becky.

14:21.194 --> 14:24.030
I knew she'd be back

14:21.194 --> 14:24.030
to apologize.

14:24.071 --> 14:26.240
- Hi, Danny.

14:24.071 --> 14:26.240
- Hi, everyone.

14:26.282 --> 14:29.577
Mr. Katsopolis, you left

14:26.282 --> 14:29.577
some things at my apartment.

14:29.619 --> 14:33.623
I assume, you'd want your

14:29.619 --> 14:33.623
emergency blow dryer back.

14:33.665 --> 14:35.958
And your emergency

14:33.665 --> 14:35.958
styling spray.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.628
Oh, no, I think you made a

14:36.000 --> 14:38.628
mistake, this must be yours.

14:38.670 --> 14:40.588
It's for "hard

14:38.670 --> 14:40.588
to<i> manage</i> hair."

14:42.340 --> 14:43.591
Oh, no, no, this must be yours.

14:43.633 --> 14:46.886
It's for vain and pompous hair.

14:46.927 --> 14:49.639
Are you guys having a fight?

14:49.681 --> 14:51.098
(both)

14:49.681 --> 14:51.098
No!

14:52.642 --> 14:54.268
We just decided not to be

14:54.310 --> 14:55.895
boyfriend and girlfriend

14:54.310 --> 14:55.895
anymore.

14:55.936 --> 14:57.271
You can't break up!

14:57.313 --> 15:01.108
Yeah, you're just like

14:57.313 --> 15:01.108
Ken and Barbie.

15:01.150 --> 15:04.904
Daddy, make them hug

15:01.150 --> 15:04.904
and say, "I love you."

15:04.945 --> 15:07.114
Could you guys hug

15:04.945 --> 15:07.114
and say, "I love you?"

15:09.158 --> 15:12.036
Well, it's nice to see everyone,

15:09.158 --> 15:12.036
but I really should get going.

15:12.078 --> 15:14.873
Oh, Becky, I've an idea.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.332
Why not all of us

15:16.374 --> 15:19.001
and, I mean, all of us

15:19.043 --> 15:21.003
go to the movies tonight?

15:21.045 --> 15:23.339
It's on me

15:21.045 --> 15:23.339
and the tooth fairy.

15:24.799 --> 15:27.552
Oh, that's nice, girls.

15:24.799 --> 15:27.552
But I have plans tonight.

15:27.594 --> 15:30.263
- Um, I'll see you guys later.

15:27.594 --> 15:30.263
- See ya.

15:31.806 --> 15:34.141
I can't believe it!

15:31.806 --> 15:34.141
She already has a date!

15:37.019 --> 15:39.522
Becky, wait!

15:39.564 --> 15:43.150
You and Uncle Jesse are gonna

15:39.564 --> 15:43.150
get back together, aren't you?

15:43.192 --> 15:44.861
Deej, I can't promise you that.

15:44.903 --> 15:46.821
Becky, you<i> have</i> to.

15:46.863 --> 15:49.949
I mean, if you'd stop

15:46.863 --> 15:49.949
coming over..

15:49.990 --> 15:51.951
...I'd really miss you.

15:51.992 --> 15:53.661
Hey..

15:53.703 --> 15:56.539
...you and I are always

15:53.703 --> 15:56.539
gonna be friends.

15:56.581 --> 15:59.667
You mean, we can still go riding

15:56.581 --> 15:59.667
and talk and stuff?

15:59.709 --> 16:03.045
Absolutely. Anytime you

15:59.709 --> 16:03.045
need me, I'm here for you.

16:03.087 --> 16:05.715
Thanks, Becky.

16:05.757 --> 16:07.467
I'll tell you what,

16:05.757 --> 16:07.467
this afternoon

16:07.508 --> 16:09.385
you and Stephanie

16:07.508 --> 16:09.385
and I can go see that movie.

16:09.427 --> 16:11.930
Great! Don't forget,

16:09.427 --> 16:11.930
it's on Stephanie.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.641
- Got it. Later, dude.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.641
- Later, babe.

16:18.937 --> 16:20.605
Becky's on the way up.

16:20.647 --> 16:23.399
- Where's Uncle Jesse?

16:20.647 --> 16:23.399
- He's not here yet.

16:23.441 --> 16:25.735
Then how are we gonna

16:23.441 --> 16:25.735
get them back together?

16:25.777 --> 16:28.696
- We gotta stall Becky.

16:25.777 --> 16:28.696
- Got it.

16:28.738 --> 16:30.573
Girls, you ready

16:28.738 --> 16:30.573
for the movie?

16:30.615 --> 16:33.660
Not yet. You gotta make up

16:30.615 --> 16:33.660
with Uncle Jesse, first.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.789
Good stall, Steph.

16:37.831 --> 16:41.083
You know, Uncle Jesse

16:37.831 --> 16:41.083
feels really terrible.

16:41.125 --> 16:43.753
He told us how sorry

16:41.125 --> 16:43.753
he was for everything

16:43.795 --> 16:46.255
he's supposed

16:43.795 --> 16:46.255
to be sorry for.

16:46.297 --> 16:49.843
He's going around with this

16:46.297 --> 16:49.843
sad little puppy face like..

16:52.679 --> 16:54.889
You do the best Elvis that

16:52.679 --> 16:54.889
I've ever seen any woman do.

16:54.931 --> 16:57.057
- I have to be honest.

16:54.931 --> 16:57.057
- Thanks, Jess.

16:57.099 --> 16:59.143
I love watching

16:57.099 --> 16:59.143
your band rehearse.

16:59.185 --> 17:00.728
Uh, thanks, I just feel bad

16:59.185 --> 17:00.728
that you had to listen

17:00.770 --> 17:02.313
to "Viva Las Vegas"

17:00.770 --> 17:02.313
seven times.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.273
[laughing]

17:02.355 --> 17:04.273
I loved it.

17:04.315 --> 17:05.942
You could put out

17:04.315 --> 17:05.942
a whole album of just that song.

17:05.984 --> 17:07.610
- Do you think?

17:05.984 --> 17:07.610
- Uh-huh.

17:07.652 --> 17:09.779
You know, this is amazing.

17:07.652 --> 17:09.779
This whole day has been great.

17:09.821 --> 17:11.572
Becky would've never sat

17:09.821 --> 17:11.572
through a rehearsal.

17:11.614 --> 17:12.907
Let me ask you something,

17:11.614 --> 17:12.907
now, if I said

17:12.949 --> 17:14.617
"Let's hop on a Harley,

17:12.949 --> 17:14.617
go to Vegas

17:14.659 --> 17:15.910
roll some dice,"

17:14.659 --> 17:15.910
what would you say?

17:15.952 --> 17:18.120
- I'd say, "Your bike or mine?"

17:15.952 --> 17:18.120
- Yes!

17:18.162 --> 17:20.206
Becky would say, "Let's stay

17:18.162 --> 17:20.206
here and play Yahtzee."

17:20.247 --> 17:22.041
Oh, so how come you can't

17:20.247 --> 17:22.041
go five minutes

17:22.082 --> 17:23.543
without mentioning Becky?

17:23.584 --> 17:25.044
Uh, did I mention Becky?

17:25.085 --> 17:28.214
Well, you did break into

17:25.085 --> 17:28.214
a chorus of "Viva Las Becky."

17:28.255 --> 17:30.216
Sorry, alright, I promise,

17:28.255 --> 17:30.216
I'm gonna go upstairs

17:30.257 --> 17:31.759
and I won't mention

17:30.257 --> 17:31.759
the 'B' word, okay?

17:31.801 --> 17:33.761
I won't even say anything

17:31.801 --> 17:33.761
that ends in "ecky".

17:33.803 --> 17:36.389
No, no, no,

17:33.803 --> 17:36.389
shecky, no trekky, I..

17:38.725 --> 17:40.309
- Uncle Jesse, I've gotta--

17:38.725 --> 17:40.309
- Not now, D.J..

17:40.351 --> 17:42.020
- Becky's here!

17:40.351 --> 17:42.020
- My Becky?

17:42.061 --> 17:43.980
I mean, my ex, Becky?

17:44.022 --> 17:46.357
And-and-and sh-she's

17:44.022 --> 17:46.357
down there and Be..

17:46.399 --> 17:48.693
Oh, I gotta think.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.693
Kid, hang on.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.862
She said she was really

17:48.735 --> 17:50.862
sorry for everything

17:50.904 --> 17:52.864
she's supposed

17:50.904 --> 17:52.864
to be sorry for.

17:52.906 --> 17:53.948
Really?

17:53.990 --> 17:55.324
All she does is make this

17:55.366 --> 17:57.744
sad little puppy face like..

17:58.870 --> 18:00.038
Really?

18:00.079 --> 18:02.040
I'm pretty sure

18:00.079 --> 18:02.040
she stopped crying.

18:02.081 --> 18:05.251
- Oh, she was crying?

18:02.081 --> 18:05.251
- All day.

18:10.631 --> 18:13.509
- Hi.

18:10.631 --> 18:13.509
- Hello.

18:13.551 --> 18:15.386
Well, it's nice of you

18:13.551 --> 18:15.386
to apologize.

18:15.428 --> 18:16.429
Yeah, well, I..

18:16.470 --> 18:19.306
Nice of me?

18:16.470 --> 18:19.306
D.J. said..

18:19.348 --> 18:23.227
Oh, what's the difference

18:19.348 --> 18:23.227
what D.J. said?

18:23.269 --> 18:26.522
She said you made that cute

18:23.269 --> 18:26.522
little puppy dog face like this.

18:26.564 --> 18:29.400
Oh, no, no, no.

18:26.564 --> 18:29.400
They said you went..

18:36.365 --> 18:38.534
Come on, didn't you guys

18:36.365 --> 18:38.534
miss each other

18:38.576 --> 18:41.287
like crazy just a little?

18:41.328 --> 18:45.332
Well, maybe I missed her

18:41.328 --> 18:45.332
like crazy just a little..

18:45.374 --> 18:47.501
...if she missed me.

18:47.543 --> 18:49.712
Did you?

18:49.754 --> 18:51.798
Of course, I missed you.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.758
Oh, Becky, I've been thinking

18:51.839 --> 18:53.758
about you non-stop.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.593
Jess, I thought

18:53.800 --> 18:55.593
we were leaving?

19:01.724 --> 19:04.477
- Well..

19:01.724 --> 19:04.477
- Who's this?

19:04.518 --> 19:06.771
- Uh, well..

19:04.518 --> 19:06.771
- You said that already.

19:06.813 --> 19:07.981
You've anything

19:06.813 --> 19:07.981
else to say?

19:08.022 --> 19:09.065
No, I-I think I'd just like

19:09.107 --> 19:10.984
to stick with "well."

19:13.444 --> 19:15.071
This could get ugly.

19:17.740 --> 19:20.284
Well, it's nice to meet you,

19:17.740 --> 19:20.284
whoever you are.

19:20.326 --> 19:23.537
I'm sure you two have

19:20.326 --> 19:23.537
a lot in common. Goodbye, Jess.

19:23.579 --> 19:25.873
Stay here one second.

19:23.579 --> 19:25.873
Wait!

19:25.915 --> 19:27.792
You couldn't

19:25.915 --> 19:27.792
even wait<i> one</i> day?

19:27.834 --> 19:30.169
I-I only made a date because

19:27.834 --> 19:30.169
you said you made a date.

19:30.210 --> 19:32.630
I didn't say I made a date,

19:30.210 --> 19:32.630
I said I made plans.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.214
- Well, a plan's a date, I--

19:32.672 --> 19:34.214
- Excuse me,

19:34.256 --> 19:37.593
But there's

19:34.256 --> 19:37.593
no other way out of here.

19:37.635 --> 19:40.972
- I'm really sorry, Diane.

19:37.635 --> 19:40.972
- I hope you're Becky.

19:41.014 --> 19:43.223
'Cause if you're not, you're

19:41.014 --> 19:43.223
going to hear an awful lot

19:43.265 --> 19:45.101
about her for the rest

19:43.265 --> 19:45.101
of the day.

19:49.480 --> 19:52.025
Really? You were

19:49.480 --> 19:52.025
talking about me?

19:52.066 --> 19:55.653
Yeah, I was talking about you,

19:52.066 --> 19:55.653
I was thinking about..

19:55.695 --> 19:57.488
I even sang, "Viva Las Becky."

19:57.530 --> 19:59.198
[laughs]

19:59.239 --> 20:00.533
Come on.

20:02.118 --> 20:04.370
I<i> hate</i> it when we fight.

20:02.118 --> 20:04.370
I mean, so silly.

20:04.411 --> 20:06.539
First you get mad,

20:04.411 --> 20:06.539
then I get mad.

20:06.580 --> 20:07.999
Oh, no! That's not

20:06.580 --> 20:07.999
the way it happens.

20:08.041 --> 20:09.625
You always get

20:08.041 --> 20:09.625
mad before I do.

20:09.667 --> 20:10.960
What? I don't get mad

20:09.667 --> 20:10.960
before you do--

20:11.002 --> 20:12.045
[indistinct argument]

20:12.086 --> 20:14.047
Alright, stop.

20:14.088 --> 20:16.132
What are we fighting about

20:14.088 --> 20:16.132
this time?

20:16.174 --> 20:18.801
I think we're fighting

20:16.174 --> 20:18.801
about the way we fight.

20:18.843 --> 20:21.846
This maybe our

20:18.843 --> 20:21.846
stupidest fight yet.

20:21.888 --> 20:25.307
Why do we fight like this?

20:21.888 --> 20:25.307
Nobody ever wins.

20:25.349 --> 20:27.643
Becky, I don't wanna win, I

20:25.349 --> 20:27.643
just...I want you to understand

20:27.685 --> 20:29.311
me better, that's all.

20:29.353 --> 20:32.398
Of course, if I happen

20:29.353 --> 20:32.398
to win in the process..

20:32.439 --> 20:34.525
Wait a minute, I think

20:32.439 --> 20:34.525
you may have accidently

20:34.567 --> 20:35.818
said something useful.

20:35.860 --> 20:38.029
- I did?

20:35.860 --> 20:38.029
- Yes!

20:38.071 --> 20:40.322
Instead of<i> arguing</i> with each

20:38.071 --> 20:40.322
other, why don't we try

20:40.364 --> 20:42.491
really listening

20:40.364 --> 20:42.491
to each other?

20:42.533 --> 20:44.326
We might learn something

20:42.533 --> 20:44.326
about the person we care about.

20:44.368 --> 20:45.828
That's exactly

20:44.368 --> 20:45.828
what I want.

20:45.870 --> 20:47.413
That's, I want us to know

20:45.870 --> 20:47.413
each other better.

20:47.454 --> 20:48.789
Understand each other. I..

20:48.831 --> 20:50.124
Let-let's put this into play,

20:48.831 --> 20:50.124
alright?

20:50.166 --> 20:51.625
Let's try this

20:50.166 --> 20:51.625
with our problem.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.377
Now, you don't wanna

20:51.667 --> 20:53.377
go to the club

20:53.419 --> 20:55.588
because it's loud, smoky,

20:53.419 --> 20:55.588
filthy and disgusting, right?

20:55.629 --> 20:57.256
Exactly, I couldn't have

20:55.629 --> 20:57.256
said it better.

20:57.297 --> 20:58.883
And you don't wanna ride horses

20:57.297 --> 20:58.883
because they're stupid

20:58.925 --> 21:00.509
smelly, and potentially

20:58.925 --> 21:00.509
dangerous.

21:00.551 --> 21:02.302
Exactly, so all we have

21:00.551 --> 21:02.302
to do is to give up everything

21:02.344 --> 21:03.971
we ever loved before

21:02.344 --> 21:03.971
and we'll both be happy, right?

21:04.013 --> 21:05.181
- Wrong!

21:04.013 --> 21:05.181
- Good,

21:05.223 --> 21:06.682
'Cause I just

21:05.223 --> 21:06.682
got this new guitar

21:06.724 --> 21:08.601
and I-I'd hate

21:06.724 --> 21:08.601
to give it up.

21:08.642 --> 21:10.895
Jesse, we don't have

21:08.642 --> 21:10.895
to give up anything.

21:10.937 --> 21:13.272
We can do our own things

21:10.937 --> 21:13.272
and still be a couple.

21:13.313 --> 21:15.233
- We can?

21:13.313 --> 21:15.233
- Sure, we can.

21:15.274 --> 21:19.361
How about if you only go riding

21:15.274 --> 21:19.361
with me, because you want to?

21:19.403 --> 21:21.864
Alright, alright and you

21:19.403 --> 21:21.864
only go to the club with me

21:21.906 --> 21:23.282
because you want to.

21:23.323 --> 21:25.409
Okay, but never because we

21:23.323 --> 21:25.409
feel we have to.

21:25.451 --> 21:27.036
Alright. I gotta

21:25.451 --> 21:27.036
tell you something.

21:27.078 --> 21:29.329
I'm-I'm still going

21:27.078 --> 21:29.329
horseback riding with you

21:29.371 --> 21:33.292
because...I-I just really

21:29.371 --> 21:33.292
love being with you.

21:33.333 --> 21:35.377
You're so sweet.

21:35.419 --> 21:37.630
Now, there is one good

21:35.419 --> 21:37.630
thing about our fighting.

21:37.671 --> 21:38.923
What's that?

21:38.965 --> 21:40.883
We have a great time making up.

21:40.925 --> 21:43.219
Yes, because our love

21:40.925 --> 21:43.219
is more important

21:43.261 --> 21:44.971
than any puddle of mud

21:45.012 --> 21:46.305
or smoky club..

21:46.346 --> 21:47.974
- Jess?

21:46.346 --> 21:47.974
- Or smelly horse..

21:48.015 --> 21:49.558
- Jess?

21:48.015 --> 21:49.558
- Or flies..

21:49.600 --> 21:51.060
- Jesse?

21:49.600 --> 21:51.060
- Or, yeah?

21:51.102 --> 21:53.896
Just say, "Have mercy"

21:51.102 --> 21:53.896
and kiss me?

21:53.938 --> 21:55.564
Have mercy!

21:59.819 --> 22:01.528
(both)

21:59.819 --> 22:01.528
Aww!

22:01.570 --> 22:04.157
I knew they were

22:01.570 --> 22:04.157
gonna come in!

22:04.198 --> 22:07.243
Well, I just wanna thank you

22:04.198 --> 22:07.243
girls for sticking your noses

22:07.285 --> 22:08.828
where they don't belong.

22:08.869 --> 22:12.372
- Anytime, Uncle Jesse.

22:08.869 --> 22:12.372
- Let's go to the movies.

22:12.414 --> 22:14.167
It's still my treat.

22:14.208 --> 22:16.627
Steph, I don't think

22:14.208 --> 22:16.627
$20 will be enough.

22:16.669 --> 22:20.380
I'm good for it. I've got

22:16.669 --> 22:20.380
a mouthful of baby teeth.

22:20.422 --> 22:22.341
- Here's 20 bucks.

22:20.422 --> 22:22.341
- Yeah.

22:22.382 --> 22:24.635
- Here's 40.

22:22.382 --> 22:24.635
- Yeah.
