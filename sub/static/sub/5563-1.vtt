00:48.320 --> 00:50.340
- Evening.
- Hello. Thank you.

02:14.240 --> 02:16.100
Come on.

02:34.520 --> 02:35.601
Hi.

02:36.840 --> 02:38.180
What?

02:38.280 --> 02:40.886
Hello, Ryan. I'm Nancy.

02:41.800 --> 02:43.220
What's this? Why...

02:43.320 --> 02:46.290
Has it... What's your...

02:49.920 --> 02:51.081
Hey...

02:51.880 --> 02:53.689
It's too much, I think.

02:55.400 --> 02:57.340
That's funny, look at that.

02:57.440 --> 03:00.410
It's Ryan, right? Isn't it? It's Ryan...

03:00.520 --> 03:02.540
I mean, not as in Ryan Wright.

03:02.640 --> 03:04.449
Like, your name's not Ryan Wright.

03:04.560 --> 03:07.340
Though you could be.
You could be Mr Ryan Wright.

03:07.440 --> 03:10.340
You could be Mr Right.

03:10.440 --> 03:13.540
Either way you're the right Ryan for me.

03:13.640 --> 03:14.880
Oh, my God.

03:15.560 --> 03:16.925
You can do this.

03:18.200 --> 03:20.220
You just put yourself out there.

03:20.320 --> 03:22.004
See what happens.

03:22.880 --> 03:25.060
Just don't drink too much.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.180
Good. And you're going.

03:30.280 --> 03:32.942
You're going. You're gone.

03:42.840 --> 03:44.330
Fuck it.

03:51.120 --> 03:53.340
There is a very, very nice beach.

03:53.440 --> 03:56.020
Terns nest there. It's beautiful.

03:56.120 --> 03:57.531
Terns?

03:58.240 --> 04:01.220
If I help you, Clarice,
it will be turns with us, too.

04:01.320 --> 04:04.340
Quid pro quo.
I tell you things, you tell me things.

04:04.440 --> 04:09.100
Not about this case, though;
about yourself. Quid pro quo.

04:09.200 --> 04:10.964
Yes or no?

04:13.268 --> 04:16.981
Yes or no, Clarice?
Poor little Catherine is waiting...

04:19.279 --> 04:20.500
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:20.600 --> 04:23.649
- Room service.
- Yes. Right this way.

04:25.320 --> 04:28.340
Lovely. Yes. Great.

04:28.440 --> 04:30.260
- There, lovely.
- Hmm...

04:30.360 --> 04:32.900
- OK?
- So, tell me, Andrew...

04:33.000 --> 04:34.820
- Can I call you Andy?
- Of course, yeah.

04:34.920 --> 04:36.940
How is the party going on downstairs?

04:37.040 --> 04:38.700
- Going pretty well, I think.
- Is it?

04:38.800 --> 04:42.060
Yeah. Erm, you know
there's food down there?

04:42.160 --> 04:46.740
Yeah, I know. I'm just not really
in the party mood tonight.

04:46.840 --> 04:49.220
Do you have any ketchup,
Andy, please? Hello?

04:49.320 --> 04:50.660
Who's Andy?

04:50.760 --> 04:53.100
A very nice young man
who's just brought me dinner.

04:53.200 --> 04:54.980
You're not at the party?

04:55.080 --> 04:57.860
I'm not at the party but I'm at a party.

04:57.960 --> 05:02.220
Hannibal and Clarice are here. Not to
mention Andy. But he's just leaving.

05:02.320 --> 05:03.860
No, alright. Put him on, please.

05:03.960 --> 05:06.770
Andy. My sister
would like to speak to you.

05:09.840 --> 05:12.040
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

05:13.304 --> 05:15.980
- Hello?
- Hi, Andy. I'm Elaine. Listen.

05:16.080 --> 05:19.980
There'll be a dress hanging up
somewhere. Can you give it to her?

05:20.080 --> 05:21.525
Ah, yeah. OK.

05:22.120 --> 05:23.860
No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no...

05:23.960 --> 05:25.540
No. No. Andy.

05:25.640 --> 05:29.060
- And tell her to put some make-up on.
- She wants you to put some make-up on.

05:29.160 --> 05:33.260
OK. That's enough. Do you have
a napkin or something, please?

05:33.360 --> 05:37.445
Look, Elaine, I've been ambushed.
Some setup with a guy

05:37.560 --> 05:40.980
- that Katie worked with.
- Well, excellent. This is good.

05:41.080 --> 05:44.660
Come on! It's just all so organised
and awkward and I can't bear it.

05:44.760 --> 05:47.220
But how the hell else
are you gonna meet someone?

05:47.320 --> 05:48.765
Well, I've met Andy.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.540
Oh, he's leaving. He didn't like that.

05:51.640 --> 05:54.180
Could you put the "Do Not Disturb"
sign on, please?

05:54.280 --> 05:56.540
No, don't do it, Andy.
Take her with you!

05:56.640 --> 05:58.340
Ah, you're yelling.

05:58.440 --> 06:00.100
You've gone all the way there.

06:00.200 --> 06:03.700
Just put your dress on.
Just pop down, show your face.

06:03.800 --> 06:06.660
- Stay ten minutes.
- The party's themed, Elaine.

06:06.760 --> 06:09.500
Oh, God, really? Get your notepad.

06:09.600 --> 06:12.140
No, please.
Come on, I'm too old for this shit.

06:12.240 --> 06:14.322
You're 34, not 84.

06:16.920 --> 06:19.440
Come on, let's hear those mantras.

06:21.960 --> 06:24.060
- Put yourself out there.
- Good.

06:24.160 --> 06:28.404
- Take chances.
- Now a little less hollow and robotic.

06:29.520 --> 06:31.921
Get stronger thighs.

06:38.320 --> 06:40.100
Be more deviant.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.860
Learn French. Cook more.

06:42.960 --> 06:45.620
Understand the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict better.

06:45.720 --> 06:47.783
Engage with...

06:51.240 --> 06:53.322
...life.

06:54.400 --> 06:57.220
Finally! Nearly sent out a search party.

06:57.320 --> 06:58.940
Call them off.

06:59.040 --> 07:02.408
- Here, have a mojito. First one's free.
- OK, well... Alright.

07:02.520 --> 07:06.100
Paid for them all with my savings
and now I have no savings.

07:06.200 --> 07:10.580
Aw. Happy engagement.
I got you, literally, a small present.

07:10.680 --> 07:14.020
I am so touched that you thought of me
when you raided the mini-bar.

07:15.200 --> 07:16.884
- Wow.
- Here she is, here she is.

07:17.600 --> 07:20.140
Oh, Nancy, you look amazing!

07:20.240 --> 07:22.860
- Cheers.
- He's gonna love her. Come on.

07:22.960 --> 07:26.740
I need just a moment longer
with my mojito and then I can jump in.

07:26.840 --> 07:29.060
He hates Facebook. He loves yoga.

07:29.160 --> 07:31.401
- He's really creative...
- Oh, good, yeah.

07:31.520 --> 07:34.780
- He is perfect for you.
- I knew you'd say that.

07:34.880 --> 07:36.620
- Oh, come on.
- Alright, alright.

07:36.720 --> 07:39.166
We were set up and look at us now.

07:44.240 --> 07:48.700
Dom, it is like your single years have
been completely wiped from your memory.

07:48.800 --> 07:53.220
I mean, do you remember
that one girl who just cried?

07:53.320 --> 07:58.220
She cried all the way through giving you
a blow job. She was weeping.

08:02.028 --> 08:03.722
So sad.

08:05.680 --> 08:07.540
And look at you now.

08:07.640 --> 08:10.980
And look at you both.
Yeah, really special.

08:11.080 --> 08:14.900
- Come on, give him a chance.
- Yeah, I will. Bring it on.

08:15.000 --> 08:19.180
You know, like me, another sad
single loser in their mid-30s, right?

08:19.280 --> 08:22.060
No. I'm actually a sad single loser
in my late 30s.

08:22.160 --> 08:23.640
Hey!

08:24.840 --> 08:26.285
He was right there.

08:28.240 --> 08:30.368
I was crying with happiness.

08:31.600 --> 08:33.443
- Oh, erm...
- Sorry.

08:34.039 --> 08:35.700
Ryan. 37.

08:35.799 --> 08:37.340
Nancy. 34.

08:37.440 --> 08:39.780
Sorry, my hand's a bit wet.
It's not wee.

08:39.880 --> 08:41.940
- Right.
- It's mojito.

08:42.039 --> 08:43.860
I mean, I didn't think it was wee.

08:43.960 --> 08:47.500
Why would it be wee? That would imply
very poor personal hygiene.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.762
I mean, I don't wipe with my hand.

08:50.800 --> 08:54.020
I use toilet paper
just like everyone else does.

08:54.120 --> 08:56.860
- Well, that's a relief.
- Hm.

08:56.960 --> 09:00.407
So is wee in a way,
if you think about it.

09:16.880 --> 09:20.521
- Oh, how about another drink?
- Yeah, that would be great. Yeah.

09:25.320 --> 09:27.740
- Let me get these.
- Oh, no, it's fine.

09:27.840 --> 09:29.860
- No, it's alright.
- No, no, seriously.

09:29.960 --> 09:32.500
- OK, you can get them.
- You get them?

09:32.600 --> 09:36.685
- I'll get them, shall I?
- Great, cheers. Thank you.

09:39.360 --> 09:41.980
Ah... Busted.

09:42.080 --> 09:44.740
You've got a picture of your ex
in the old wallet.

09:44.840 --> 09:46.700
Oh, no, that's my sister.

09:46.800 --> 09:51.806
Oh. She's very pretty.
I bet she gets all "ze boyz".

09:52.520 --> 09:54.443
She's dead.

09:54.560 --> 09:57.211
Wow. It's going so well.

10:20.040 --> 10:22.900
No, Elaine, I've got pictures
of my cats in my wallet

10:23.000 --> 10:24.500
and they're alive and kicking

10:24.600 --> 10:26.700
and I want people to ask me about them.

10:26.800 --> 10:30.043
- Well, it's good that you went.
- Why is it good?

10:30.880 --> 10:35.740
It's just so excruciating
and predictable, just as it always is.

10:35.840 --> 10:39.447
I'm just gonna let my vagina
hermetically seal up.

10:39.560 --> 10:42.260
- Yeah, well, that will really help.
- Never hurt Barbie.

10:42.360 --> 10:46.060
She's got a beach buggy
and horses and a salon.

10:46.160 --> 10:47.400
And a boyfriend.

10:47.520 --> 10:50.500
Is she still with that guy?
Such a fake smile.

10:51.960 --> 10:54.740
- How long are you gonna be?
- Get your arse over here pronto.

10:54.840 --> 10:58.020
We have a lot of nibbles
to put into a lot of bowls.

10:58.120 --> 11:00.100
About two hours.

11:00.200 --> 11:03.443
A reminder to all passengers
that due to engineering work

11:03.560 --> 11:06.140
no trains are currently stopping
at Clapham Junction.

11:06.240 --> 11:08.580
- About seven hours.
- What the fuck?!

11:08.680 --> 11:11.620
- I'm joking.
- Not funny.

11:11.720 --> 11:13.700
- I can't do this on my own.
- Hello.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.620
And don't forget the chocolate mousse.

11:15.720 --> 11:17.980
Mum's obsessed.
And you've done your speech?

11:18.080 --> 11:19.260
I've got a rough draft.

11:19.360 --> 11:22.220
You haven't. You've done
a lot of doodles and crossing out.

11:22.320 --> 11:24.580
- I mean, as if.
- Come on.

11:24.680 --> 11:26.620
You know Dad loves it
when you do a speech.

11:26.720 --> 11:29.540
So it needs to be good and special. OK?

11:29.640 --> 11:30.860
Fine.

11:30.960 --> 11:32.260
- Oh, and Nancy?
- Yeah?

11:32.360 --> 11:36.660
Don't seal up just yet.
It'll happen. I promise.

11:36.760 --> 11:38.603
Yeah, yeah. Fuck off.

11:44.920 --> 11:45.921
Oh.

11:47.800 --> 11:49.260
Black...

11:49.360 --> 11:51.010
pant...

11:52.160 --> 11:53.969
wash.

11:58.080 --> 11:59.860
Sorry.

11:59.960 --> 12:02.620
I couldn't help overhearing.

12:02.720 --> 12:06.060
You should really think about
reading this.

12:06.160 --> 12:08.162
Right. Right, right, right, right.

12:10.280 --> 12:12.740
- Did it, then?
- Did it what?

12:12.840 --> 12:15.411
- Change your life.
- Oh, erm...

12:15.520 --> 12:18.500
- Maybe. Yeah.
- But maybe not as well?

12:18.600 --> 12:22.860
Well, I like to give everything a go,
because otherwise what's the point?

12:22.960 --> 12:27.921
You've got to hope it's going to work.
Because what is life without hope?

12:28.880 --> 12:31.260
- Death.
- Death it is, then.

12:31.360 --> 12:34.100
You see, you do need to read it.

12:34.200 --> 12:37.500
I would lend you my copy
but I need it for my date.

12:37.600 --> 12:41.500
- Why do you need a book for a date?
- It's how we'll recognise each other.

12:41.600 --> 12:44.410
Oh, it's a setup? They always work.

12:44.520 --> 12:48.340
They often work if the matchmaker
has done their homework.

12:48.440 --> 12:52.340
All successful relationships are based
on whether you're both outdoorsy...

12:52.440 --> 12:53.860
- Read it.
- Don't need to.

12:53.960 --> 12:56.140
- It was a best seller.
- So was The Da Vinci Code.

12:56.240 --> 12:58.980
- Another excellent book.
- Not an excellent book.

12:59.080 --> 13:01.820
- I think it's what you need.
- Why does everyone tell me that?

13:01.920 --> 13:04.400
If they're always telling you,
you should listen.

13:04.520 --> 13:07.763
I think you need to shh.
You need to shh your mouth.

13:08.440 --> 13:11.860
- You want me to shh?
- I do, yeah. It would be great.

13:11.960 --> 13:13.820
- I'm only suggest...
- It's time.

13:13.920 --> 13:16.048
I think... I think we're done.

13:19.440 --> 13:20.980
Ladies and gentlemen,

13:21.080 --> 13:24.766
we are now arriving at our final
destination, London Waterloo.

13:47.560 --> 13:51.690
- Sorry. Excuse me.
- I say.

13:54.040 --> 13:55.371
Ow. Shit.

14:14.320 --> 14:15.911
What?

14:16.960 --> 14:18.689
- Excuse me, please.
- What?!

14:20.760 --> 14:22.762
- There you go.
- Cheers.

14:48.520 --> 14:51.620
- Where the fuck are you?
- Blimey, I'm not that late, am I?

14:51.720 --> 14:53.900
Somebody threw themselves
on the track again.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.500
I don't blame them,
there's so many delays.

14:56.600 --> 15:00.020
Hey, what a great way for us to
recognise each other. What a great idea.

15:00.120 --> 15:03.820
Although I think it would have been hard
to miss you under that huge clock.

15:03.920 --> 15:05.020
No, no, no...

15:05.120 --> 15:08.180
What do we do in terms of saying hello?
I never know where to pitch it.

15:08.280 --> 15:10.340
Is it a handshake? Is it a hug?
Is it formal?

15:10.440 --> 15:13.700
You know what, we're adults.
Let's just go in... Too soon for that?

15:13.800 --> 15:15.820
Hello, there.

15:15.920 --> 15:19.100
Oh, my God, that's not your
emergency exit phone call already?

15:19.200 --> 15:22.580
I haven't had a chance
to use any of my best lines yet.

15:22.680 --> 15:24.740
That wasn't one of them,
if you were worried.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.500
Listen, I'll handle this, madam.

15:26.600 --> 15:29.260
Hello, caller. Yes, we have met.

15:29.360 --> 15:32.060
I am not a complete psychopath
and we've really hit it off.

15:32.160 --> 15:34.980
She will call you later
with all the gory details.

15:35.080 --> 15:37.740
So thank you for calling and goodbye.
There, done.

15:37.840 --> 15:42.060
Alright! So, book, check.
And clock, check.

15:42.160 --> 15:45.084
And blind date. Check!

15:48.320 --> 15:53.020
Usually in this situation I would say
something and you'd say something back.

15:53.120 --> 15:56.100
And then we'd talk about what we're
gonna do and exchange ideas.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.646
You know, sort of
"quid pro quo, Clarice".

16:02.280 --> 16:05.409
In hindsight, that wasn't the best
impression to do on a first date

16:05.520 --> 16:09.540
because it... it brings to mind...
Anyway, I'm talking a lot

16:09.640 --> 16:12.340
and I know you can sense it.
So I'm gonna just keep going

16:12.440 --> 16:13.900
and I'm gonna start the bidding

16:14.000 --> 16:17.060
with a drink on London's
fashionable South Bank.

16:17.160 --> 16:20.403
So, as the book says,
what are you waiting for?

16:24.240 --> 16:27.722
I am waiting for you.

16:28.400 --> 16:30.940
- Good. Good.
- Yeah.

16:31.040 --> 16:34.169
OK. Shall we...? After you, my lady.

16:35.080 --> 16:36.740
I'm not a knight.

16:36.840 --> 16:39.320
Yeah, let's do it.
We'll go out this way...

16:49.920 --> 16:52.660
What do you think?
Good stuff for the first few hours?

16:52.760 --> 16:55.100
Descending in quality as we do.

16:55.200 --> 16:58.220
I'd go quality and quantity, Bert.
It's a massive night.

16:58.320 --> 17:01.403
You're right. We bloody deserve it.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.443
Let's go mental.

17:03.560 --> 17:06.980
Seriously, you do deserve it.
I don't know how you've done it.

17:07.079 --> 17:10.402
Not that I don't intend to go
the whole distance myself, obviously.

17:10.520 --> 17:13.819
I think the trick is, get through
the first 30, 40 years,

17:13.920 --> 17:17.700
then just kind of give up.
From that point on it's a breeze.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.780
- No, I mean it.
- How are we getting on?

17:19.880 --> 17:22.060
- We are nailing it.
- That's great.

17:22.160 --> 17:24.619
You can put about
half those lagers back, Adam.

17:24.720 --> 17:26.859
What does Nancy want to drink?

17:26.960 --> 17:29.260
- I'm not sure if...
- She wants vodka.

17:29.360 --> 17:32.443
The only spirit she can out-drink me on.
We'll see about that later.

17:32.560 --> 17:33.700
No, we won't.

17:33.800 --> 17:37.300
Guys, she didn't even answer the phone.
Some man did. I think she's on a date.

17:37.400 --> 17:39.940
The man from last night?
I thought that didn't work out.

17:40.040 --> 17:41.820
It didn't. It was a disaster.

17:41.920 --> 17:44.780
- He was in love with his sister.
- Who answered the phone, then?

17:44.880 --> 17:47.406
Dad, I don't know.
He said he wasn't a psychopath.

17:47.520 --> 17:49.540
Well, that sounds encouraging.

17:49.640 --> 17:53.140
We're having a party. She's on a date.
I'm thinking she's gonna bring him.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.300
- Bert!
- If he's not a psychopath.

17:55.400 --> 17:58.260
Did he sound like a wine drinker
or more of a beer man?

17:58.360 --> 17:59.441
Bert!

17:59.560 --> 18:02.020
- I'm just getting some more wine.
- Course you are.

18:02.120 --> 18:04.700
The good host is prepared
for all eventualities.

18:04.800 --> 18:06.740
Come on, Pattersons, clock's ticking.

18:06.840 --> 18:09.161
Fran, you walk straight past that offer.

18:10.080 --> 18:13.700
So, what's going on? Is Nancy OK?

18:13.800 --> 18:16.780
Yes. Yes, Mum, she's fine. She's just...

18:16.880 --> 18:19.100
- He's looking forward to her speech.
- I know.

18:19.200 --> 18:22.044
- So she is coming?
- Yes, of course she's coming.

18:22.880 --> 18:27.363
Look, do you want me to write
a few words? You know, just in case.

18:27.960 --> 18:30.060
Not really, darling, no.

18:30.160 --> 18:33.220
Oh, God. That is horrible.

18:33.320 --> 18:34.740
I'm sorry.

18:34.840 --> 18:38.049
- I'll give her a call, then.
- Yes, please do, darling.

18:50.720 --> 18:52.210
Ah...

18:56.320 --> 18:58.660
- You OK? You seem a bit freaked out.
- Do I?

18:58.760 --> 18:59.860
Yeah.

18:59.960 --> 19:03.060
Gosh. Sorry, just bit of
a first-date no-no...

19:03.160 --> 19:05.780
Oh, my God, that's embarrassing.

19:05.880 --> 19:07.980
- Oh, it's Tom.
- Oh.

19:08.080 --> 19:09.241
Hey, buddy.

19:09.880 --> 19:13.540
Yeah, I'm here. I'm with Jessica.

19:13.640 --> 19:15.740
Yeah, we're on the South Bank.

19:15.840 --> 19:18.366
Yeah, d'you wanna speak to her? Alright.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.411
We will.

19:22.840 --> 19:27.100
Yeah. OK, Tom.
Yeah, I'm gonna hang up now.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.884
Yeah, OK. Bye. Bye.

19:29.960 --> 19:32.700
- He thought we hadn't met up.
- As if.

19:32.800 --> 19:36.043
- Shall we switch these things off?
- Yeah. OK, good.

19:36.760 --> 19:39.445
Right. So, Jessica.

19:39.560 --> 19:40.780
So...

19:40.880 --> 19:44.780
- Tom says that you work in the City.
- I do, yeah. That's what I do.

19:44.880 --> 19:47.580
- Is that a stressful job?
- Ah, no.

19:47.680 --> 19:49.980
"Lunch is for wimps."

19:50.080 --> 19:51.060
Sorry.

19:51.160 --> 19:53.180
- No, no, it's from Wall Street.
- Yeah.

19:53.280 --> 19:56.443
"If you need a friend, get a dog."
I love that movie.

19:56.560 --> 19:58.980
- You do?
- Yeah, it's one of my favourites.

19:59.080 --> 20:02.300
- And you are a...?
- I'm an online marketing manager.

20:02.400 --> 20:05.529
I love online marketing managing.

20:06.640 --> 20:09.220
What I really wanna do is paint.

20:09.320 --> 20:11.860
I don't wanna be an online
marketing manager forever

20:11.960 --> 20:15.180
because, you know,
the bots are taking over!

20:15.280 --> 20:18.700
They're gonna be managing
all the marketing in the future.

20:18.800 --> 20:23.100
- It's like "help".
- Exactly, yeah. Erm...

20:23.200 --> 20:25.220
- I'm a bit nervous, to be honest.
- Really?

20:25.320 --> 20:30.451
Yeah. A little bit. Just a little bit.
I'm not used to all this dating chat.

20:30.560 --> 20:34.780
Although, you know, I had a few
reservations about today,

20:34.880 --> 20:37.740
but I just thought,
"You know what, Jack? I trust Tom."

20:37.840 --> 20:41.890
He's not gonna set me up with somebody
who I've nothing in common with.

20:42.640 --> 20:45.020
- And he's a good friend, right?
- Who, Tom?

20:45.120 --> 20:47.020
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'd take a bullet for him.

20:47.120 --> 20:50.540
Yeah. So, shall we
get a beer or something?

20:50.640 --> 20:53.450
- There's one of those pop-up bars.
- Sure, that'll be great.

20:53.560 --> 20:56.220
They appear out of nowhere,
then they're gone the next day.

20:56.320 --> 20:59.860
This can't be our favourite place
because it'll be gone in the morning.

20:59.960 --> 21:03.020
- Can we get two Red Stripes?
- That'd be great.

21:03.120 --> 21:04.700
- So...
- So...

21:04.800 --> 21:07.860
Where are you on the old, you know,
the relationship...

21:07.960 --> 21:09.660
the spectrum of relationships?

21:09.760 --> 21:14.020
- It's my mime for relationships.
- That's good. Right.

21:14.120 --> 21:16.820
Well, I guess long-term-wise it's...

21:16.920 --> 21:18.820
It's been a while.

21:18.920 --> 21:21.580
- Since Pete, right?
- Since Pete.

21:21.680 --> 21:23.100
Tom told me. Massive cock.

21:23.200 --> 21:24.220
- Really?
- Huge.

21:24.320 --> 21:26.220
- It wasn't that big...
- What he did to you.

21:26.320 --> 21:27.580
- ...a deal.
- Unforgivable.

21:27.680 --> 21:29.900
I know how it feels.
I had it done to me, you know.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.540
- Affairs, eh? Who'd have them?
- Yeah...

21:32.640 --> 21:33.860
- They would.
- They would.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.440
The other people would.

21:36.560 --> 21:39.260
So where are you on the... spectrum?

21:39.360 --> 21:43.020
On the spectrum? I think recently,
I've had a few one-night stands.

21:43.120 --> 21:46.620
You know, just girls I've met at work

21:46.720 --> 21:49.405
and in bars and just, like,
on the street.

21:51.160 --> 21:56.041
But this is my first real date really
since the D-word.

21:56.760 --> 21:59.060
- Dead sister?
- Sorry?

21:59.160 --> 22:01.940
Just something I say before I drink.
Dead sister.

22:02.040 --> 22:03.140
Dead sister.

22:03.240 --> 22:06.700
But I'm not gonna let a failed marriage
put me off relationships for good.

22:06.800 --> 22:08.180
Divorce.

22:08.280 --> 22:10.900
You be thankful that
you and Pete didn't get hitched.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.740
It gets a lot more complicated when you
have to figure out who gets the flat.

22:14.840 --> 22:16.285
Winner.

22:17.240 --> 22:19.242
- I did.
- Yeah.

22:20.120 --> 22:23.740
I got big home-improvement plans.
I'm gonna do up our... my flat.

22:23.840 --> 22:25.900
Paint the hallways, bleach the sheets.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.020
Anyway, let's not talk about that.
It's just bad juju.

22:29.120 --> 22:31.407
- And I'm so over it.
- You really sound it.

22:31.520 --> 22:35.060
It's in the past. What does it say
in Six Billion People and You?

22:35.160 --> 22:37.860
- F... Fuck the past.
- Fuck the past, yeah.

22:37.960 --> 22:40.940
If that book has taught me anything,
it's taught me that.

22:41.040 --> 22:43.407
So, Tom says you're a triathlete.

22:44.720 --> 22:47.100
- Hm-hmm.
- Do you have to train a lot for that?

22:47.200 --> 22:49.900
Yeah, I've just got
to regularly carb up.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.300
Ah! Yeah, yeah.

22:51.400 --> 22:54.500
Go on then. I don't mind.
I've actually worked out today...

22:54.600 --> 22:58.571
I work out every day.
I like to keep fit. I pump iron, sure.

23:00.120 --> 23:01.340
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

23:01.440 --> 23:05.260
This is nice, isn't it? I don't envy
any of my friends with kids.

23:05.360 --> 23:07.780
Are they here now? Hell, no.

23:07.880 --> 23:11.300
They're at home lying in wait
for the next nappy change.

23:11.400 --> 23:12.660
Not that I don't want kids.

23:12.760 --> 23:16.020
I'm 40. They're not gonna be swimming
in the right direction forever.

23:16.120 --> 23:19.940
But just not right now. I should
probably get a girlfriend first.

23:20.040 --> 23:24.700
I definitely want kids. I'm just not
freaking out about it yet.

23:24.800 --> 23:27.406
I mean, why would you? You're 24.

23:29.360 --> 23:32.780
D'you wanna get out of here?
It is fucking freezing

23:32.880 --> 23:36.180
and I know a really fun place
just over the river.

23:36.280 --> 23:40.285
We can get shots and maybe hang out
a bit more if you feel like it.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.764
- Yeah, I'd love that.
- OK.

23:47.600 --> 23:51.020
- This is gonna be fun.
- Yeah. What is it?

23:51.120 --> 23:52.860
It's like a cantina.

23:52.960 --> 23:55.804
It's a bit cheesy
but you can have slammers and...

23:59.800 --> 24:01.529
Oh, wow. Arriba!

24:02.720 --> 24:04.210
- Hey, man.
- How's it going?

24:04.840 --> 24:08.500
- Are you a regular here?
- Well, define "regular". What is it?

24:08.600 --> 24:10.860
- Hi, Jack.
- Hey, Helen, how's it going?

24:10.960 --> 24:11.980
Oh, so you...

24:12.080 --> 24:13.220
Ah! Snap.

24:13.320 --> 24:15.140
- We're swapping, right?
- Swapping?

24:15.240 --> 24:18.900
For the genius Six Billion Ways to get
to know you list that you suggested.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.940
Is that your one?
Mine's at the front. OK...

24:24.280 --> 24:26.900
Let's have a look, shall we? OK, then.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.368
Shall I read yours first?
"Put yourself out there."

24:31.840 --> 24:33.251
"Take chances."

24:34.320 --> 24:37.290
- "Black pant wash."
- It's a band.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.180
- Are they new?
- Yeah, they're new.

24:40.280 --> 24:43.700
They're... They're fresh. Very young.
They're my favourite band.

24:43.800 --> 24:46.451
Oh, yeah, of course.
Yeah, they're very, er, funky.

24:47.320 --> 24:49.540
"Get stronger thighs."

24:49.640 --> 24:53.180
Hey, this is spooky.
I also love spaghetti bolognese.

24:53.280 --> 24:54.980
What are the chances of that?

24:55.080 --> 24:58.402
- Like none chances.
- I know. That's the lists done.

24:58.520 --> 25:00.060
- Yeah!
- And didn't they go well?

25:00.160 --> 25:01.900
- Really great.
- That was...

25:02.000 --> 25:04.700
- Look, let me get this.
- No, I should get it.

25:04.800 --> 25:07.140
- Please, let me.
- OK. I'll get the next ones.

25:07.240 --> 25:09.980
- Oh, my God. Who are they?
- Who, what?

25:10.080 --> 25:14.260
- These guys.
- Oh, this is Slash and Axl.

25:14.360 --> 25:15.660
Oh.

25:15.760 --> 25:17.285
Paradise Kitties.

25:18.960 --> 25:22.248
- I blew it, sorry. That was no good.
- Er...

25:24.000 --> 25:28.340
Jack. I've got a confession to make
and I'm just gonna...

25:28.440 --> 25:30.500
- So have I.
- ...come out with it. You have?

25:30.600 --> 25:33.968
- I have, yeah. Let me go first. I...
- OK.

25:34.960 --> 25:36.883
I've never heard of Black Pant Wash.

25:37.680 --> 25:41.401
I'm sorry. I wanna be honest with you,
because honesty is very important...

25:41.520 --> 25:42.540
Yes, I agree.

25:42.640 --> 25:46.020
These lists are great
and they're a brilliant ice-breaker,

25:46.120 --> 25:49.740
but you don't really believe that
just because we both like spag bol,

25:49.840 --> 25:52.620
we're gonna wind up together
forever, right?

25:52.720 --> 25:56.140
- Depends on the spag bol.
- Might be a really good spag bol.

25:56.240 --> 26:00.060
But right now, whatever happens tonight,
wherever we end up,

26:00.160 --> 26:02.940
I'm having a really good time
getting to know you.

26:03.040 --> 26:07.220
And you're being really patient with me,
so thank you for that.

26:07.320 --> 26:09.220
And I don't know why I brought you here.

26:09.320 --> 26:11.860
It was a stupid idea
and I think we should...

26:11.960 --> 26:14.580
Let's do something different.
Let's go someplace else.

26:14.680 --> 26:18.220
- Tom said you liked bowling.
- I love bowling.

26:18.320 --> 26:21.767
OK, so shall we have a couple more
and then hit the lanes?

26:25.920 --> 26:27.081
OK.

27:33.000 --> 27:37.300
Who said blind dates don't work?
Right? Am I right? Yeah.

27:37.400 --> 27:39.641
- I'm gonna go get us a drink.
- OK.

27:46.280 --> 27:48.780
- Nancy?
- Yeah?

27:48.880 --> 27:50.166
It's Nancy Patterson.

27:50.920 --> 27:54.367
- Do we know each other?
- Sean. Sean Bellamy.

27:55.440 --> 27:58.091
Class 5G, Saint Andrew's Comprehensive.
'88 to '93.

27:58.720 --> 28:00.820
I sat next to you in chemistry
for five years.

28:00.920 --> 28:02.820
I gave you that Valentine's card
in Year 9.

28:02.920 --> 28:04.740
You tore it up in front of everyone.

28:04.840 --> 28:09.058
- Your mum ran me over that time.
- Oh, God. Yes, I do remember.

28:09.520 --> 28:11.940
- Erm, sorry about that.
- Oh, God, don't worry.

28:12.040 --> 28:14.820
Glued it back together.
It was only about 57 pieces.

28:14.920 --> 28:15.940
I meant about the car.

28:16.040 --> 28:18.140
- But you were so...
- Fat. Yes.

28:18.240 --> 28:20.447
- Yeah.
- That was me, big fat Sean.

28:20.560 --> 28:22.260
Lord of the Pies. Emperor Boom-Boom.

28:22.360 --> 28:24.780
- Now you're very...
- Yeah, I went on the 5:2 diet.

28:24.880 --> 28:28.020
Five days on chocolate Nesquik.
And two days strawberry Nesquik.

28:28.120 --> 28:31.260
- Oh, OK.
- I lost it all from here and from here.

28:31.360 --> 28:33.283
But luckily not from here.

28:34.280 --> 28:37.409
- Could I just have two beers, please?
- Hell, yeah.

28:39.120 --> 28:42.203
- It's Nancy fucking Patterson.
- Shush.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.650
Wow!

28:48.600 --> 28:49.900
- Hey...
- Hey.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.843
- These are on me.
- OK.

28:52.600 --> 28:54.340
So good to see you.

28:54.440 --> 28:55.885
Thank you.

28:57.680 --> 28:59.205
OK, cheers.

29:03.040 --> 29:06.260
- Ah. Flirting with the barman, I see.
- What? No.

29:06.360 --> 29:08.900
- Not at all, no.
- I was, like, "Whoa, competition."

29:09.000 --> 29:11.620
No, I wasn't. I'm the least jealous
person you'll meet.

29:11.720 --> 29:13.180
Oh, God, me, too, yeah.

29:13.280 --> 29:14.300
So,

29:14.400 --> 29:16.220
let's ramp this up a bit.

29:16.320 --> 29:17.845
Not that I'm competitive.

29:19.120 --> 29:20.451
Nancy.

29:21.160 --> 29:23.060
Brought you some nachos. On the house.

29:23.160 --> 29:25.500
- I've got a wheat allergy...
- No, you don't.

29:27.160 --> 29:28.730
You remember this?

29:29.320 --> 29:32.449
- What is it? Where'd you get that?
- In my wallet.

29:32.560 --> 29:34.449
- Who took it?
- I did.

29:34.560 --> 29:36.820
I don't remember you ever
being in my bedroom.

29:36.920 --> 29:40.447
I wasn't in your bedroom, silly.
I was outside. In a tree.

29:40.560 --> 29:43.140
- Jessica, watch and weep.
- OK.

29:43.240 --> 29:47.340
Why is he calling you Jessica?
You're called Nancy.

29:47.440 --> 29:50.300
- You're Nancy Patterson.
- I'm in a bit of a situation here.

29:50.400 --> 29:53.060
Oh, you still use Pantene Pro-V.

29:53.160 --> 29:56.100
That guy is not my boyfriend.
He's actually not even my date.

29:56.200 --> 29:59.100
I sort of stole him from
underneath the clock at Waterloo

29:59.200 --> 30:02.300
and I'm pretending to be the girl
he's supposed to be on a date with.

30:02.400 --> 30:04.660
- So it's a bit... I don't know.
- Kinky.

30:04.760 --> 30:06.410
Hey, there.

30:06.520 --> 30:09.940
- How's it going? I'm Jack.
- And I am Sean.

30:10.040 --> 30:11.940
- He's Sean.
- There it is.

30:12.040 --> 30:15.580
- So you guys know each other?
- We just went to school together.

30:15.680 --> 30:19.260
- Yeah, we're old friends.
- We're old, old friends.

30:19.360 --> 30:22.140
We used to have a bit of a thing
going on.

30:22.240 --> 30:23.820
- Good for you.
- It was.

30:23.920 --> 30:25.580
It really wasn't that good.

30:25.680 --> 30:27.300
You never forget your first.

30:27.400 --> 30:29.660
Lovely to see you after all these years.

30:29.760 --> 30:32.660
- We'll take it from here.
- Hang on, Jessica.

30:32.760 --> 30:34.900
Hey. What are you doing?

30:35.000 --> 30:38.860
It would appear that I finally have you
over a barrel, Nancy Patterson.

30:38.960 --> 30:42.260
Indeed, you are clearly not the girl
you used to be once.

30:42.360 --> 30:47.300
Cool and confident. Now, stealing other
women's dates from under clocks.

30:47.400 --> 30:50.100
You're working as a barman
in a novelty bowling alley so...

30:50.200 --> 30:52.540
- Just as Mr Armstrong predicted.
- Who's that?

30:52.640 --> 30:55.900
Our careers advisor at Saint Andrew's.
Do you not remember anything?

30:56.000 --> 30:59.300
- No.
- Because I remember everything. Nancy!

30:59.400 --> 31:04.180
Sean, I'm out bowling with a man who...
might actually have some potential

31:04.280 --> 31:07.500
and not in just that
he's a really good bowler-type way.

31:07.600 --> 31:10.220
So don't ruin it for me. Just be cool.

31:10.320 --> 31:12.100
- OK, I will.
- Yeah?

31:12.200 --> 31:15.807
- Uh-huh. If you give me a blow job.
- You what?

31:16.440 --> 31:19.620
- Take it or leave it.
- Are you out of your fucking mind?

31:19.720 --> 31:23.240
Come on, wouldn't hurt.
Just a tiny little blow job.

31:24.120 --> 31:28.740
And then I won't dismantle your
web of deceit, Little Miss... Muffet.

31:28.840 --> 31:32.700
- Not gonna give you a blow job, so...
- Hand job? Pearl necklace?

31:32.800 --> 31:35.220
- Kiss? Please. Come on.
- Stop. Stop it. Stop it.

31:35.320 --> 31:37.300
I just want to fulfil
a lifelong ambition.

31:37.400 --> 31:40.100
OK, OK. I'll do one kiss. OK?

31:40.200 --> 31:41.740
- With tongues?
- No tongues.

31:41.840 --> 31:44.260
- Oh! But in the toilets.
- Yeah, in the toilets.

31:44.360 --> 31:45.980
And it has to be tonight.

31:46.080 --> 31:49.402
Otherwise I won't find you again
because you have no online presence.

31:49.520 --> 31:50.700
- Can I go now?
- Yes.

31:50.800 --> 31:53.451
- But I'll be watching you.
- I don't doubt that.

31:55.320 --> 31:58.620
Oh, shit, shit, shit!

31:58.720 --> 32:00.900
It's fine, they're fine.

32:01.000 --> 32:04.220
Everyone'll just get drunk
and shove them down.

32:04.320 --> 32:05.820
- They will.
- Yeah?

32:05.920 --> 32:07.020
Look.

32:07.120 --> 32:10.100
- Ooh, blimey, they're hot.
- Any word from Nancy?

32:10.200 --> 32:12.180
Not... Not exactly.

32:12.280 --> 32:14.020
Oh, no. No, no.

32:14.120 --> 32:17.900
But in her defence, she does have
a very good reason for her tardiness.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.100
And she's right, Fran.

32:20.200 --> 32:25.580
And who knows, maybe today will end up
being not just our anniversary.

32:25.680 --> 32:27.500
Imagine that, Mum.

32:27.600 --> 32:29.780
Oh, my God,
who would you worry about then?

32:29.880 --> 32:31.860
Oh, Bert, you've slobbed.

32:31.960 --> 32:34.620
- What? Where?
- Christ. What is this now?

32:34.720 --> 32:36.404
It's hummus.

32:36.520 --> 32:38.921
Take it off. Off, off, off.

32:41.562 --> 32:42.860
Guests.

32:42.960 --> 32:45.940
- Go get 'em, parents.
- Bert, shift your arse.

32:46.040 --> 32:47.140
I'm going!

32:47.240 --> 32:48.980
Marion, you made it!

32:49.080 --> 32:51.580
I feel... I just feel like...
I feel hustled.

32:51.680 --> 32:54.500
Because I won? Are you not used to that?

32:54.600 --> 32:57.251
I'm not really used
to losing at bowling.

32:57.880 --> 33:00.540
Oh, can't I keep them?

33:00.640 --> 33:03.140
You think it's the first time
he's heard that?

33:03.240 --> 33:05.607
They're cute. Well, maybe tonight.

33:06.160 --> 33:09.209
Let's not forget this.
Keep you nice and warm.

33:11.560 --> 33:14.020
- Are you saving that for later?
- What?

33:14.120 --> 33:16.500
Got a bit of jalapeÃ±o in your teeth.

33:16.600 --> 33:20.660
You've just got a little bit of spinach
or something jammed in.

33:20.760 --> 33:22.860
No, it's still there. It's...

33:22.960 --> 33:24.940
Oh, my God. It's a good one.

33:25.040 --> 33:27.620
OK. No, it's not, though, is it?

33:27.720 --> 33:31.020
- No, it's still wedged in.
- I'm just gonna nip to the ladies.

33:31.120 --> 33:36.060
I'll just stay here and I'll think about
what we can get up to next.

33:37.920 --> 33:39.206
OK...

33:40.040 --> 33:44.060
I'll just go in there and think about
what we can get up to next.

33:44.160 --> 33:45.366
OK.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.331
Nice.

34:05.880 --> 34:08.139
What do you want to get up to next?

34:08.239 --> 34:11.562
Because I know
what I wanna get up to next.

34:12.600 --> 34:14.940
I saw you were about to leave
so I took my break early.

34:15.040 --> 34:18.806
Fucking hell, Sean!
Leaving? I wasn't leav...

34:20.320 --> 34:21.699
Er, bye.

34:21.800 --> 34:25.340
Fine. I'll put my clothes back on
and have a word with Jack about Jessica.

34:28.600 --> 34:30.060
So,

34:30.159 --> 34:33.300
where do you wanna land
those luscious lips?

34:36.960 --> 34:40.340
- We're gonna keep the door open.
- Now you're talking.

34:40.440 --> 34:42.168
Right, let's just...

34:43.440 --> 34:44.440
OK...

34:45.320 --> 34:48.722
- Sean...
- Move closer

34:50.199 --> 34:53.100
- Move your body real close
- I'd prefer you didn't sing that.

34:53.199 --> 34:54.500
- Will you hold my face?
- Why?

34:54.600 --> 34:55.860
It'll make it more romantic.

34:55.960 --> 34:58.060
I don't think this could be
any more romantic.

34:59.520 --> 35:01.740
No, we said no tongues.
We said no... Hey!

35:01.840 --> 35:03.300
Jessica?

35:03.400 --> 35:04.820
- Hey, man.
- Jack.

35:04.920 --> 35:07.820
You'd been gone awhile
so I thought I'd come and find you.

35:07.920 --> 35:10.820
- This is not what you think.
- I think I'm just gonna leave.

35:10.920 --> 35:13.540
- No, wait. Please, let me explain.
- You don't have to.

35:13.640 --> 35:16.780
I thought we had a connection
but you still have something for Sean.

35:16.880 --> 35:19.406
I'm gonna leave you
to whatever fucking weird shit...

35:19.520 --> 35:22.444
Jack, Jack, Jack.
Just slide it on down to chills-ville.

35:22.560 --> 35:24.940
Don't be so harsh on Nancy.

35:25.040 --> 35:27.300
Who's Nancy?
Why is he calling you Nancy?

35:27.400 --> 35:30.820
- Why?
- It was my other pet name for her.

35:30.920 --> 35:33.220
- After Nancy Reagan.
- Nancy Sinatra.

35:33.320 --> 35:35.780
- I'm gonna go.
- OK, wait, hang on.

35:35.880 --> 35:39.220
Wait, Jack, let me just tell you
the truth because...

35:39.320 --> 35:41.448
now is as good a time as any
just to confess.

35:41.560 --> 35:42.780
Confess what?

35:42.880 --> 35:47.140
The reason Sean called me Nancy
was because I'm not called Jessica

35:47.240 --> 35:50.926
and the reason I'm not called Jessica
is because I'm not actually Jessica.

35:51.880 --> 35:54.860
She's Nancy. She's Nancy Patterson.

35:54.960 --> 35:58.407
Thank you, Sean. Can you put your
clothes back on and leave? Please.

35:58.520 --> 36:01.205
- What about my kiss?
- Out. No. Jog on. Out!

36:02.960 --> 36:05.740
Anyway, look, I was in here with him

36:05.840 --> 36:09.300
because he said he wouldn't tell you
who I really was if I kissed him.

36:09.400 --> 36:11.580
The truth is,
I'm not really your blind date.

36:11.680 --> 36:15.180
You thought I was, what with the book,
the clock and the quid pro quo.

36:15.280 --> 36:18.900
So you're not the girl
that I was supposed to meet earlier?

36:19.000 --> 36:20.540
- No.
- What?!

36:20.640 --> 36:23.405
I know! It sounds a bit mad.
But don't think of it as mad.

36:23.520 --> 36:25.860
Think of it as impulsive.

36:25.960 --> 36:28.020
What kind of person
stands underneath a clock

36:28.120 --> 36:30.540
- waiting to steal someone's date?
- I wasn't waiting.

36:30.640 --> 36:33.260
It's not stealing
in the conventional sense of the word.

36:33.360 --> 36:36.091
That girl gave me her book
so that's why you thought I was her.

36:36.200 --> 36:38.740
No, I thought you were her
because you said you were.

36:38.840 --> 36:40.540
Did I actually say that?

36:40.640 --> 36:43.740
When were you thinking of telling me
about this bizarre decision?

36:43.840 --> 36:47.540
- There wasn't actually a plan.
- I'm sure there wasn't a plan.

36:47.640 --> 36:50.580
Because who would have a plan
for something so fucked up?

36:50.680 --> 36:53.411
I think people have done
worse things in the world.

36:53.520 --> 36:57.140
- I'm racking my brains.
- That girl wasn't even right for you.

36:57.240 --> 37:01.060
We'll never know. I'll never meet her
because you stole her.

37:01.160 --> 37:04.220
I was merely trying to meet my mate
in the modern world.

37:04.320 --> 37:07.820
- Who are you?
- I'm Nancy Patterson. Hello.

37:07.920 --> 37:10.740
- Are you even a triathlete?
- That's the next thing you ask?

37:10.840 --> 37:13.900
- And where's Jessica?
- Probably gone home by now.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.820
- Past her bedtime.
- Are you even 24?

37:16.920 --> 37:19.660
- Aw. Add another ten.
- What?

37:19.760 --> 37:23.500
- Fuck you, Granddad.
- Not in six billion years.

37:23.600 --> 37:25.860
- That was uncalled for.
- That was uncalled for?

37:25.960 --> 37:27.820
- Yeah.
- Do you know what's uncalled for?

37:27.920 --> 37:29.500
Derailing my date.

37:29.600 --> 37:30.820
OK.

37:30.920 --> 37:34.140
Laugh it up, girls. I am your future.
Just so you know.

37:34.240 --> 37:36.300
- 34!
- 40!

37:36.400 --> 37:38.940
- I think you're overreacting a bit.
- Really?

37:39.040 --> 37:40.700
- Yeah.
- How would you feel, Nancy,

37:40.800 --> 37:43.260
if you'd been set up
with someone perfect for you

37:43.360 --> 37:45.442
and some psycho
pretends to be them instead?

37:45.560 --> 37:48.580
- Setups never work.
- Tom said we matched.

37:48.680 --> 37:52.060
Please, she reads self-help books
and The Da Vinci Code.

37:52.160 --> 37:54.620
She works in the City.
What does that even mean?

37:54.720 --> 37:56.180
When people say that?

37:56.280 --> 37:59.220
It means she is a high-flying
24-year-old businesswoman...

37:59.320 --> 38:01.980
24. You love that word.
It's your favourite word.

38:02.080 --> 38:03.740
Isn't that just the classic response

38:03.840 --> 38:07.140
of the lonely 34-year-old woman
desperate for somewhere to put her eggs.

38:07.240 --> 38:09.980
I'm nearly at my sexual peak.
It's all downhill for you.

38:10.080 --> 38:12.260
Knock knock, who's there? Viagra!

38:12.360 --> 38:13.940
The bitter look really suits you.

38:14.040 --> 38:16.180
It doesn't surprise me
that Pete slept around.

38:16.280 --> 38:18.660
Hang on a sec. Oh, oh, oh!
There is no Pete!

38:18.760 --> 38:20.900
And there is no wife
because she left you.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.900
Here's your theory. You think,
"I'm so wounded and rejected."

38:24.000 --> 38:27.540
"Please, help me, younger woman,
who's nearly half my age."

38:27.640 --> 38:30.500
This is coming from someone
who had to steal someone else's date

38:30.600 --> 38:31.620
to even get one.

38:31.720 --> 38:34.820
At least I'm not walking around
like I'm bloody catch of the century.

38:34.920 --> 38:38.340
Look at me with my own flat
and my online marketing management job.

38:38.440 --> 38:41.220
But what I really want to do is paint.

38:41.320 --> 38:43.620
- I am gonna paint. OK?
- Sure you are.

38:43.720 --> 38:46.500
Thank you very much, it was lovely
not getting to know you

38:46.600 --> 38:49.620
and congratulations
on your massive pack of lies.

38:49.720 --> 38:52.564
- Where's my bag?
- That was all there was on the ticket.

38:53.240 --> 38:54.900
- Where's my bag?
- How should I know?

38:55.000 --> 38:56.340
Why have I got your notepad?

38:56.440 --> 38:59.740
Oh, f... Oh, my God,
we've left my bag at the cantina.

38:59.840 --> 39:02.180
Your bag, not mine.
How many tequilas have you had?

39:02.280 --> 39:04.620
- My divorce papers are in there.
- Ooh, sexy.

39:04.720 --> 39:07.260
- I came from the lawyers, alright?
- Sexier.

39:07.360 --> 39:10.820
Your divorce papers...
and my notepad with my speech!

39:10.920 --> 39:12.900
What speech?

39:13.000 --> 39:15.860
It's my folks' 40th wedding anniversary
tonight.

39:15.960 --> 39:19.780
It just gets better. Not only do you
steal somebody else's blind date,

39:19.880 --> 39:23.441
you stand up your parents on one of the
most important milestones of their life.

39:23.560 --> 39:27.020
You really, really need to consider
your motivations for doing things

39:27.120 --> 39:28.860
and not doing things.

39:28.960 --> 39:31.100
- I'm gonna get my speech.
- Whatever. Taxi!

39:31.200 --> 39:34.580
- What are you doing?
- Calling a cab so I can go to the bar.

39:34.680 --> 39:36.940
- It's a ten-minute walk.
- No, it's 20 minutes.

39:37.040 --> 39:40.442
- It's ten minutes!
- You seem awfully confident, Nancy.

39:40.560 --> 39:42.449
- Because it's a fact, Jack.
- It's a fact.

39:42.560 --> 39:45.020
Is it a fact?
Like the fact that you're a triathlete.

39:45.120 --> 39:47.060
- Great.
- Here's a good idea.

39:47.160 --> 39:50.860
Why don't you run, swim and cycle to the
bar and we'll see who gets there first?

39:50.960 --> 39:53.500
- What?
- You don't know what a triathlon is.

39:53.600 --> 39:54.980
- Yes, I do.
- You do, do you?

39:55.080 --> 39:57.367
- Yeah.
- Well, ready, steady...

39:59.160 --> 40:00.764
go!

40:03.960 --> 40:06.804
Get stronger thighs!

40:07.560 --> 40:09.164
Come on, come on, come on!

40:15.560 --> 40:18.609
- Bye.
- Twat! Shit!

40:25.396 --> 40:26.725
What?

40:30.000 --> 40:31.100
No.

40:32.280 --> 40:33.361
Shit.

40:33.880 --> 40:36.929
Excuse me. Why so many feathers?

40:42.160 --> 40:43.241
Shit!

40:47.000 --> 40:50.129
Hey. Sir. Kind person.

40:53.720 --> 40:55.165
Come on, come on, come on.

41:00.000 --> 41:02.300
Excuse me! Coming through.

41:02.400 --> 41:04.129
Just go further up. It's on the left.

41:05.400 --> 41:06.890
Mind your back!

41:16.080 --> 41:17.580
In your 40-year-old face!

41:17.680 --> 41:21.207
- I thought you weren't competitive.
- I thought you weren't competitive.

41:23.760 --> 41:24.966
You alright?

41:26.560 --> 41:28.300
It's a tactical puke.

41:28.400 --> 41:30.660
- It better be in there.
- Of course it will.

41:34.360 --> 41:36.540
- Hey, you want some more tequila?
- No!

41:36.640 --> 41:38.980
- Is his man-bag here?
- It's a satchel, OK.

41:39.080 --> 41:42.620
- I'm not used to carrying it.
- Alright, I'll go check.

41:42.720 --> 41:44.660
- Where are you going?
- Toilet.

41:44.760 --> 41:47.180
- You gonna meet somebody?
- No, so don't follow me.

41:47.280 --> 41:49.442
I have no intention of doing that again.

41:59.880 --> 42:01.086
Fuck!

42:34.360 --> 42:35.980
Hi, you've called Elaine.

42:36.080 --> 42:39.004
Leave a message
and I'll get back to you. Thanks.

42:55.800 --> 42:58.220
Nice one, Nancy.

42:58.320 --> 43:00.527
Really, really nice.

43:02.960 --> 43:04.724
It's great stuff.

43:08.120 --> 43:12.080
Hey, you know. New mantra.

43:12.680 --> 43:16.127
Stop being such a loser.

43:18.760 --> 43:20.330
How about that?

43:36.920 --> 43:38.524
Er...

44:00.360 --> 44:01.964
Yay.

44:20.320 --> 44:24.500
- Do you even like bowling?
- I love bowling.

44:24.600 --> 44:27.620
Great. So you weren't faking it
the whole night, then?

44:27.720 --> 44:30.121
Bet you've said that line before.

44:32.080 --> 44:33.570
Look...

44:35.080 --> 44:37.340
Look, I realise
this is not my finest hour.

44:37.440 --> 44:40.967
- Oh, you don't say?
- Yeah. I know.

44:42.280 --> 44:47.140
In hindsight, agreeing to Sean's demands
was not the best decision

44:47.240 --> 44:48.660
that I've made all evening.

44:48.760 --> 44:52.620
- You could've just told me the truth.
- I know and I was going to,

44:52.720 --> 44:55.291
I really was, but then...

44:57.040 --> 44:59.500
"Jessica" was doing so well.

45:00.208 --> 45:02.100
One man-bag.

45:02.200 --> 45:04.168
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

45:08.080 --> 45:10.560
- What?
- Black Pant Wash.

45:13.600 --> 45:15.170
Funky.

45:18.440 --> 45:19.726
Idiot.

45:20.880 --> 45:22.041
Idiot.

45:22.840 --> 45:24.171
Jack?

45:26.760 --> 45:28.900
What are you doing here?
I thought we agreed.

45:29.000 --> 45:30.260
What are you doing here?

45:30.360 --> 45:32.540
- Hello, Jack.
- Fuck off, Ed.

45:32.640 --> 45:35.900
I get this place between five and 10pm
on a Saturday.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.100
Sorry, I thought it was a Sunday.

45:38.200 --> 45:41.020
I think we all know that you know
that it's not on a Sunday.

45:41.120 --> 45:44.100
Oh, how I miss that
pissy little diary of yours.

45:44.200 --> 45:47.260
Do you still put an "M" in it
when it's moustache-dyeing week?

45:47.360 --> 45:51.365
He didn't know. Hey, this is Nancy,
by the way. My girlfriend.

45:52.400 --> 45:54.540
Nancy, this is Hilary,
my soon-to-be ex-wife,

45:54.640 --> 45:56.660
and Ed, the man she left me for.

45:56.760 --> 46:00.446
- Come on, Jack.
- Yeah, come on, silly me.

46:00.560 --> 46:03.940
You know what? We're all in
the same bar with our new partners.

46:04.040 --> 46:07.260
Let's have a drink together.
We're adults, aren't we?

46:07.360 --> 46:09.940
We're mature, stable adults.

46:10.040 --> 46:12.020
- Come on. Have you got a table?
- Yeah.

46:12.120 --> 46:14.900
- Is it "our" table?
- Not any more.

46:15.000 --> 46:17.020
Good! Even better. Lead the way.

46:17.120 --> 46:20.900
- Oh, my God. What is happening?
- Just go with it, darling.

46:21.000 --> 46:22.809
Just go with it, Edward.

46:23.840 --> 46:27.300
Oh, my God. You knew they'd be here.
That's why you brought me here earlier.

46:27.400 --> 46:31.780
That is why I brought "Jessica" here.
Then I came to my senses and we left.

46:31.880 --> 46:34.580
- But then you left my bag here...
- You left your bag.

46:34.680 --> 46:38.401
And then you came out of the toilets
looking like... Hmm...

46:38.520 --> 46:41.540
I just thought people have done
worse things in the world

46:41.640 --> 46:44.660
and you are very good at pretending
to be people that you're not.

46:44.760 --> 46:47.366
And you owe me, Nancy.

46:56.108 --> 46:59.568
OK. What exactly
are you hoping to achieve?

47:00.920 --> 47:02.968
I believe they call it "closure".

47:12.120 --> 47:15.580
Missed a call from Nancy. She's not
even gonna make it for the speeches.

47:15.680 --> 47:17.940
What the fuck do you think she's doing?

47:18.040 --> 47:21.700
- What you always tell her to do.
- But not the greatest night to pick.

47:21.800 --> 47:24.060
But she's being spontaneous.

47:24.160 --> 47:26.740
Be spontaneous
when there's nothing else planned.

47:26.840 --> 47:28.444
Don't you think this is a bit...

47:28.560 --> 47:31.060
I'm gonna see what's happened
before I pass judgement.

47:31.160 --> 47:32.860
Are you? Well, good for you.

47:32.960 --> 47:36.060
Jesus, when has she ever done
anything like this before?

47:36.160 --> 47:38.980
- Well, never, but...
- Pardon, what was that?

47:39.080 --> 47:40.180
Never.

47:40.280 --> 47:43.820
She's out there, somewhere,
doing you proud, meeting a man.

47:43.920 --> 47:47.180
Having a lovely time.
Just like when we first met.

47:47.280 --> 47:51.126
- We met in a pub.
- But it was a lovely romantic pub.

47:52.320 --> 47:54.140
It was a Yates's Wine Lodge.

47:54.240 --> 47:57.164
Do you remember the first thing
you ever said to me?

47:58.120 --> 48:01.249
- "Vodka and tonic, please."
- And I said?

48:02.720 --> 48:04.449
"Pint or a half?"

48:07.160 --> 48:09.060
What is the worst-case scenario?

48:09.160 --> 48:13.006
- We never see her again.
- Alright, second worst?

48:25.880 --> 48:27.500
- You hungry?
- No.

48:27.600 --> 48:29.820
- Little snackette?
- No, don't need it.

48:29.920 --> 48:31.160
So...

48:32.360 --> 48:34.700
how long have you two
been seeing each other?

48:34.800 --> 48:36.940
- Not long.
- Not long at all.

48:37.040 --> 48:38.451
How did you meet?

48:38.560 --> 48:39.780
- At work.
- At a party.

48:39.880 --> 48:42.020
- At a work party.
- At a party that worked.

48:42.120 --> 48:44.732
So you're in online marketing, too?

48:45.840 --> 48:48.081
No. I am a...

48:49.280 --> 48:51.700
firewoman. I'm a firewoman.

48:51.800 --> 48:54.820
- There was a fire.
- At his work party.

48:54.920 --> 48:57.082
And then in our pants.

48:58.560 --> 49:01.740
So, Hilary, what is it that you...
What do you do for a living?

49:01.840 --> 49:03.820
I'm an account manager
at a leading PR firm.

49:03.920 --> 49:05.445
Mind-blowing. And you, Ed?

49:05.560 --> 49:07.580
- I'm a merchant banker.
- Interesting fact.

49:07.680 --> 49:10.411
"Merchant banker" is
cockney rhyming slang for "wanker".

49:10.520 --> 49:11.740
Oh, for fuck's sake, Jack.

49:11.840 --> 49:13.980
It's a fact. I'm just saying.
I'm not lying.

49:14.080 --> 49:16.020
- It's been a year.
- It's OK, Hil.

49:16.120 --> 49:19.060
It's not the first time
I've heard that one.

49:19.160 --> 49:21.980
- First time I've heard it.
- I'm unaffected by it, so...

49:22.080 --> 49:26.580
And it's been more than a year,
actually, Hilary. It's been 368 days.

49:26.680 --> 49:30.060
Not that I'm crossing it off on
my wall calendar of pain and deceit.

49:30.160 --> 49:31.571
I need a piss.

49:32.440 --> 49:34.169
Oh, fuck! Shit.

49:37.040 --> 49:38.883
- Oh, shit.
- Hey...

49:39.760 --> 49:44.402
Hey, don't worry, Baby Cakes. This was
bound to happen sooner or later.

49:45.080 --> 49:48.323
He does this. It's kind of blackmail.

49:49.200 --> 49:51.328
He's a very emotional man.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.970
We're gonna need more nibbles, please.
So...

49:57.560 --> 49:58.846
question.

50:00.400 --> 50:03.740
- You two had an affair?
- We fell in love.

50:03.840 --> 50:05.763
Yeah, but you had an affair?

50:06.560 --> 50:09.325
- The marriage was over anyway.
- But you had an affair?

50:12.560 --> 50:15.245
- Yeah.
- I guess he is just an emotional man.

50:17.280 --> 50:18.860
Look, I'm sorry, Hilary.

50:18.960 --> 50:21.820
- The truth is...
- I missed you, Big Nuts.

50:23.240 --> 50:27.060
So what rating
are you two rabbits on now?

50:27.160 --> 50:30.100
- Rating?
- Yeah, sexually speaking?

50:30.200 --> 50:33.724
Because Jack and I, God,
we're still in porno land really.

50:33.824 --> 50:34.860
Porno land?

50:34.960 --> 50:37.500
- Hm-hmm. Shall I explain?
- Please do.

50:37.600 --> 50:40.620
OK. You know when a woman
first starts sleeping with a man,

50:40.720 --> 50:42.020
she acts like a porn star.

50:42.120 --> 50:43.980
Am I right? Jack and I, anything goes.

50:44.080 --> 50:47.500
Church of Lesbyterian, dinner beneath
the bridge, guided tour of site B,

50:47.600 --> 50:49.140
if you know where that is. He knows.

50:49.240 --> 50:52.500
Remember when you said we should
and I was like, "I'm not gonna do that."

50:52.600 --> 50:54.260
- You said, "Go on, try it."
- Did I?

50:54.360 --> 50:58.140
And I was just thinking, "I'm actually
quite scared," because I couldn't see.

50:58.240 --> 51:00.740
Then, God, you flipped it.
And all of a sudden...

51:00.840 --> 51:03.540
God, I felt like, "Please don't stop."

51:03.640 --> 51:07.620
"Jack, please don't stop. Don't stop,
Jack. Do what you do, Jack."

51:07.720 --> 51:09.940
"Thank you, Jack.
I love your work, Jack."

51:10.040 --> 51:13.940
And you lot are like, "Wow, our sex life
is always gonna be like a porn film."

51:14.040 --> 51:17.340
Six months in, the ladies,
we drop it down to an 18,

51:17.440 --> 51:20.980
and then a 15, maybe a quick 69
but only if we've just had a bath.

51:21.080 --> 51:25.900
And then suddenly, whoa, we're a PG-13
wearing tartan pyjamas to bed

51:26.000 --> 51:29.641
doing the goodnight rollover before
you can say "missionary position".

51:31.600 --> 51:33.700
That is a brilliant theory.

51:33.800 --> 51:37.407
Thank you. But do you know what, Jack?
I really feel

51:37.520 --> 51:41.570
like we're gonna be in porno land
for a lot longer than usual.

51:42.880 --> 51:45.451
- I have a theory, too.
- Yeah? What is it?

51:45.560 --> 51:49.060
If you get a woman back to your place
and you say you don't wanna have sex,

51:49.160 --> 51:53.882
you just wanna take it slowly,
I guarantee she will go down on you.

51:54.800 --> 51:57.820
- The Blow Job Paradox.
- Blow Job Paradox!

51:57.920 --> 52:01.060
- Yeah! "Use it, don't abuse it."
- If divorce papers were honest,

52:01.160 --> 52:03.540
they wouldn't say
"irreconcilable differences".

52:03.640 --> 52:06.300
- They'd say "not enough blow jobs".
- Not enough blow jobs!

52:06.400 --> 52:08.500
Like, get down there, fix it.

52:08.600 --> 52:12.446
Sorry to interrupt. Did you
get a chance to sign those papers?

52:14.600 --> 52:19.340
Yes, I did, actually, Hilary. In fact,
coincidentally, I have them with me.

52:19.440 --> 52:23.140
Although, stupid Jack,
I signed them with a pen.

52:23.240 --> 52:26.210
You'd probably prefer it
if I did it with my own blood.

52:28.160 --> 52:32.324
Hey, this is our song. We should dance.
It's very special. Isn't that mad?

52:33.040 --> 52:35.300
Don't fucking touch me.

52:35.400 --> 52:36.860
- Yay.
- What are you doing?

52:36.960 --> 52:38.940
Stopping you from making
a twat of yourself

52:39.040 --> 52:40.980
by using the medium of dance. Hello.

52:41.080 --> 52:43.740
I'm gonna slow-dance you
into submission, OK?

52:43.840 --> 52:47.340
You'll need to put your arms around
my waist for it to work properly. Good.

52:47.440 --> 52:50.100
- I'm such a dick.
- You're not. You're not a dick.

52:50.200 --> 52:53.020
It's always better
to be the one that's dumped.

52:53.120 --> 52:55.620
You never regret anything.
She made the decision.

52:55.720 --> 52:57.980
She's gotta live with that
for the rest of her life.

52:58.080 --> 53:01.540
- It's not as simple as that, is it?
- But it will be. It just takes time.

53:01.640 --> 53:05.440
- Your hands are slipping down my arse.
- Sorry. Old habit.

53:06.360 --> 53:09.140
Everybody knew they were doing it.
Nobody told me.

53:09.240 --> 53:11.100
It's rough. I'll admit it's rough.

53:11.200 --> 53:12.660
I was really traditional about

53:12.760 --> 53:15.500
the whole "don't sleep around
when you're married" thing.

53:15.600 --> 53:17.580
Hands-arse. That's right.

53:17.680 --> 53:20.540
I bet you proposed
on the top of a Tuscan hill.

53:20.640 --> 53:22.180
Cephalonian, actually.

53:22.280 --> 53:24.060
Spent a year planning your big day.

53:24.160 --> 53:25.900
- Twenty grand, all in?
- Bit more.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.340
- Let's not forget the ring.
- It was four grand.

53:28.440 --> 53:31.260
And we had to get it resized
because she got awfully thin.

53:31.360 --> 53:34.820
You spent Â£24,000
on a party and some jewellery?

53:34.920 --> 53:35.980
It was a grand gesture.

53:36.080 --> 53:38.780
What's the point of life
if you're not up for stuff like that?

53:38.880 --> 53:42.566
A grand gesture that amounted
to nothing. Hands-arse.

53:42.680 --> 53:46.140
- God, you're such a fucking cynic.
- And you're such a fucking romantic.

53:50.200 --> 53:55.580
You put so much emphasis on that one day
and forget about the rest of your life.

53:55.680 --> 53:58.340
What's wrong with having a big day?
Look at your parents.

53:58.440 --> 54:01.011
I bet they had a party and guests
and a wishing tree.

54:01.120 --> 54:04.180
Six guests. Local registry office.
Drinks at the pub afterwards.

54:04.280 --> 54:05.940
They decided it was more important

54:06.040 --> 54:08.327
to concentrate on the promises
they were making.

54:08.440 --> 54:10.660
Don't you think that's what I wanted?

54:10.760 --> 54:13.220
When you get married,
you make a promise you can't keep,

54:13.320 --> 54:16.020
but, by God, I was gonna try,
and I'll never regret that.

54:16.120 --> 54:17.540
Which is more than you can say,

54:17.640 --> 54:20.660
sat up there on your single perch
with all your judgements.

54:20.760 --> 54:24.300
Why-y-y-y-y don't you use it

54:24.400 --> 54:27.722
Try-y-y-y-y not to bruise it

54:28.280 --> 54:31.443
Buy-y-y-y-y time, don't lose it

54:31.560 --> 54:33.700
They're not judgements,
they're theories.

54:33.800 --> 54:35.450
- Very different things.
- Whatever.

54:35.560 --> 54:39.700
The reflex is an only child

54:39.800 --> 54:43.140
Just waiting by the park

54:43.240 --> 54:46.940
The reflex is in charge of finding

54:47.040 --> 54:50.860
Treasure in the dark

54:50.960 --> 54:54.300
And watching over lucky clover

54:54.400 --> 54:58.540
Isn't that bizarre?

54:58.640 --> 55:02.220
Every little thing the reflex does

55:02.320 --> 55:05.900
Leaves you answered
with a question mark

55:06.000 --> 55:08.220
- You know your problem, Nancy?
- What?

55:08.320 --> 55:11.660
You spend your entire time on the
sidelines theorising about what works,

55:11.760 --> 55:14.740
but never putting yourself out there.
You never take chances.

55:14.840 --> 55:17.660
I think my actions today
could be considered quite "chancy".

55:17.760 --> 55:19.140
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

55:19.240 --> 55:23.564
You need to man up. I married that
woman and she tore out my heart

55:23.680 --> 55:26.740
but I'm still standing.
I'm still putting myself out there.

55:26.840 --> 55:29.411
And who are you to say
that my marriage was doomed?

55:29.520 --> 55:31.540
Who are you to say
that the girl I met tonight,

55:31.640 --> 55:34.860
the girl I was supposed to meet tonight,
wasn't the girl of my dreams?

55:34.960 --> 55:38.860
You need to let me get on
with my sad single-man life crisis

55:38.960 --> 55:42.931
and keep your cynical wisecracks
and theories to yourself. OK?

55:46.240 --> 55:48.020
Why-y-y-y

55:48.120 --> 55:50.771
Why-y-y-y
Why-y-y-y

55:58.840 --> 56:02.003
Hi. Sorry. I'm not looking.

56:02.840 --> 56:05.900
Just... looking for Jack.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.606
- Jack, are you in here?
- No.

56:09.360 --> 56:10.900
Come on.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.300
Just go to your party, Nancy, I'm fine.

56:13.400 --> 56:16.643
- You're fine?
- Yeah, I'm really fucking fine.

56:17.960 --> 56:19.060
Occupied!

56:19.160 --> 56:22.687
Sorry. You didn't lock. Didn't lock.

56:32.280 --> 56:33.441
Hi.

56:34.040 --> 56:36.220
I was hoping
for the pants-and-socks look.

56:47.200 --> 56:50.283
Nice place you got. It's really cosy.

57:01.680 --> 57:02.761
Sorry.

57:04.080 --> 57:09.060
I've had a bad relationship run
over the past few years

57:09.160 --> 57:13.722
and so it's made me
not the most positive person.

57:15.320 --> 57:17.846
I overanalyse and I...

57:19.120 --> 57:23.780
come up with elaborate theories and
make monumentally bad decisions and...

57:23.880 --> 57:27.540
I've gotta move on, you know,
that's all.

57:27.640 --> 57:29.820
She's out there, she's happy.

57:29.920 --> 57:32.048
She's getting on with her life
and I'm...

57:33.000 --> 57:35.765
- I'm just holding on.
- OK.

57:36.960 --> 57:41.580
A, I wouldn't say "happy", exactly.

57:41.680 --> 57:45.820
And secondly, I mean,
you're not holding on to her.

57:45.920 --> 57:47.820
You're holding on to a feeling

57:47.920 --> 57:51.561
and that feeling will eventually pass.
Promise.

57:52.040 --> 57:54.820
I mean, look, maybe I was wrong.

57:54.920 --> 57:59.620
Maybe dating 24-year-olds
is exactly what you need right now.

57:59.720 --> 58:02.530
- You've changed your tune.
- Well, unlike...

58:03.240 --> 58:07.131
the older lady,
they do have less baggage.

58:08.560 --> 58:12.260
I mean, shit, I'm way over
my baggage allowance.

58:12.360 --> 58:15.125
I'm four years single.
Four fucking years.

58:16.240 --> 58:21.180
Prior to that, I had six years
with the supposed love of my life,

58:21.280 --> 58:24.124
when, out of the blue,
he ended it and then he...

58:25.120 --> 58:28.020
He said he wanted to go to China
to find himself.

58:28.120 --> 58:30.580
Then he found himself
shacked up in Shepherd's Bush

58:30.680 --> 58:32.620
with some other girl six months later.

58:32.720 --> 58:35.724
- I'm over it, obviously, but I just...
- Yeah, you really sound it.

58:38.360 --> 58:39.700
Apart from one thing.

58:39.800 --> 58:43.540
One thing that, honestly,
I'm not sure that I can ever get over.

58:43.640 --> 58:44.860
What?

58:44.960 --> 58:46.200
He...

58:47.720 --> 58:50.060
He de-authorised me from his iTunes.

58:51.400 --> 58:54.051
What? That is unforgivable.

58:54.840 --> 58:57.320
It is. It is, actually.

58:59.280 --> 59:02.045
So, what do you really do for a living?

59:03.040 --> 59:05.340
I'm a journalist. Yeah.

59:05.440 --> 59:08.540
Slash wannabe literary polymath.

59:08.640 --> 59:12.140
- That figures. You got good theories.
- Oh, you like them now?

59:12.240 --> 59:13.820
I wouldn't listen to me, though,

59:13.920 --> 59:17.740
because I'm not exactly the poster child
for the dating industry.

59:17.840 --> 59:20.969
Really? I'm 40, divorced
and crying in a toilet.

59:22.960 --> 59:24.644
You're just...

59:26.040 --> 59:28.220
You're an emotional jigsaw at the moment

59:28.320 --> 59:30.820
but you're gonna piece yourself
back together.

59:30.920 --> 59:34.163
You know, start with the corners.
Look for the blue bits.

59:36.800 --> 59:40.850
And where do I find these "blue bits"?

59:45.840 --> 59:47.980
Took me three years to get over my ex.

59:48.080 --> 59:53.100
Jungian therapy.
Two hours every day. Six weeks.

59:53.200 --> 59:56.340
I burnt her clothes. Twice.

59:56.440 --> 59:58.900
I'm not saying
that her porn star theory is correct.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.500
But you did blow job paradox me?

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:03.500
Hey. Where did you two get to?

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:05.900
Probably 69-ing in the toilets,
no doubt.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.740
Who's up for a shot?
Let's do some shots.

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:11.980
- I think I've had enough to drink.
- We're just gonna head off.

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:14.980
Nonsense. It's a seminal night
so we should mark it somehow.

01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:16.860
Four sambucas, please.

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:19.180
You look like you've been crying.

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:21.700
- Actually, I was crying.
- With laughter.

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:24.220
Have you ever tried to do it
in a cubicle that small?

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:27.100
I think I left my knickers in there.

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:30.100
She does not need to know
the real reason for your tears.

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:32.300
Did you wanna
leave your knickers in there?

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:33.640
Focus, Jack.

01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:36.980
Repeat after me.

01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:40.900
"After this shot I will be stronger,
wiser and finally moving on."

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.020
After this shot I will be stronger,
wiser and finally moving on.

01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:47.361
- Fuck the past.
- Fuck the past.

01:00:51.753 --> 01:00:52.808
Sorry.

01:00:52.908 --> 01:00:54.620
- Oh, my God.
- Do something!

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:57.451
You're a fireman,
put the fucking fire out!

01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:59.642
- Here. You take it.
- Jesus!

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:10.300
That is what I call closure.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:13.220
I think that's the dictionary definition
right there.

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:16.449
Denial, depression, acceptance.

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:18.050
- Fire.
- Fire.

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:22.700
What?

01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:24.260
Alright, what is next?

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:27.260
- OK, what's the time?
- It is ten o'clock.

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:30.820
Is it? Oh, shit.
I should check in at home, really.

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:32.540
Yeah, I'd better...

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:42.080
So, I think I'd better finally head
to my folks' anniversary party

01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:45.442
but I was just... This is a crazy idea
but I was just thinking,

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:47.300
- would you want to join...?
- Sorry.

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:52.220
Just because it might be nice to not
go alone for a change and if you...

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:57.020
Oh, my God, she has called
and texted, like, a lot.

01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:58.700
- Who has?
- Jessica.

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:01.740
She said she spoke to Tom
and there's obviously been

01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:04.620
some sort of misunderstanding
and she still wants to meet up.

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:06.900
Even though you stood her up?
Is she a loser?

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.740
Technically, you stood her up, actually.

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:14.020
She's young so she's not
a total cynic like you. Us. Yet.

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:16.140
Your 24-year-old obsession, isn't it?

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:18.060
You said I should keep it simple.

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:21.289
- When?
- Like, half an hour ago in the toilet.

01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:25.220
So, what is your theory on this one?

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:29.180
- My theory?
- Yeah, I wanna hear it. What's the...

01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:31.681
Is it "boy meets girl"
or "boy doesn't meet girl"?

01:02:33.805 --> 01:02:35.253
I mean...

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:39.300
This is when you tell me what to do
and then we argue and then...

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:42.500
You know, it's a bit of back and forth
and eventually...

01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:45.300
- Oh, wait.
- What for?

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:48.180
All night you've had
all these theories and opinions

01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:49.980
and suddenly you've nothing to say?

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:53.140
What do you want? Do you want
my permission or something?

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:56.980
- No, not at all.
- Then I think you should meet Jessica.

01:02:57.080 --> 01:03:00.620
- Yeah, but that's not...
- What are you waiting for, right?

01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:04.020
What am I...? I don't know
what I'm waiting for.

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:05.451
Fine, I'll meet Jessica.

01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:07.449
- OK. Great.
- OK.

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:11.900
- Are you meeting her here or...
- Yeah. Yes, there it is.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.260
- OK.
- That's where the...

01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:15.601
You can give her this back then.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.651
- No, she bought another one.
- Course she did.

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:21.740
I haven't really read it, to be honest.

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:23.330
Maybe we should have.

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:26.845
So, erm...

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:30.085
- Is that everything?
- Yeah.

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:34.500
So sorry for derailing your date.

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:39.340
I'm glad you did, otherwise I'd have
nothing to talk about on the next one.

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:42.540
It is a good anecdote.
I'll probably use it in future myself.

01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:45.100
So, well, look after yourself...

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:47.980
- It's what I do best.
- OK, and...

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:49.525
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:01.300
- I'll Facebook you.
- Not on Facebook.

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:04.244
- Idiot.
- Idiot.

01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:10.124
Idiot.

01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:11.966
Idiot.

01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:05.220
What kind of nutter pretends to be
someone else's blind date?

01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:06.860
I know. It's...

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:10.700
Although it does prove what a publishing
sensation Six Billion has been.

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:11.860
Yeah.

01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:16.100
Let's just pretend the whole thing
never happened and we shall start again.

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:17.361
Cheers.

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:27.410
Sorry, I'm ever so thirsty.
I did a lot of walking today.

01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:32.580
So, Jessica,
I hear you work in the City.

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:35.889
- Correct. And I love it.
- "Lunch is for wimps."

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:40.900
It's from Wall Street. From the film.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.140
"If you need a friend, get a dog."

01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:46.449
Oh, is that the one
with Leonardo DiCaprio?

01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:47.686
Er, no.

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:52.140
Erm, so listen, Tom told me
that you are a triathlete.

01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:00.441
Bert, are you ready? Yeah?

01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:01.800
- Alright?
- Yep.

01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:03.727
Attention!

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:06.180
Attention.

01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:07.260
Attenzione.

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:08.580
Oi! Come on.

01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:10.648
Adam, thank you.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.729
Well, here we all are.

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:19.060
I had rather hoped that
our youngest daughter, Nancy,

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:21.140
would have been here to do the speech.

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:24.642
But, er, she's been a little delayed.

01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:29.767
So it falls to myself...

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:34.180
to find a few choice words.

01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:39.446
But, I mean, seriously...

01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:43.660
what's left for us to say
to each other after 40 years?

01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:45.820
Take the fucking recycling out.

01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:50.601
Still as foul-mouthed
as the day I met her.

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:52.900
And still as beautiful.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.126
Ah!

01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:59.700
And although I doubt that we have
another 40 years ahead of us...

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:01.540
Bloody hope not.

01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:03.722
...or we will ever agree...

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:07.780
that you can park on
a double yellow line on a Sunday...

01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:10.300
- But you can, actually.
- Whose side are you on?

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:14.100
...or she will ever fully trust me
with the big weekly shop...

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:15.940
Not a hope in hell.

01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:19.647
...but here's to spending...

01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:24.660
whatever years we have left together.

01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:25.780
Ah!

01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:26.881
Franny,...

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.540
I am an empty shell on the beach
without you.

01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:32.700
Oh, that's good.

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:37.500
I am a laundry disaster
waiting to happen.

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:41.803
I am an old pear...

01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:46.725
left to soften in the fruit bowl.

01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:49.854
Oh, here she is.

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:51.620
Nancy!

01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:56.645
So sorry I'm late. But I remembered
the chocolate mousse.

01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:00.980
Oh...

01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:04.402
- What is it, darling? What is it?
- What's up?

01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:06.300
- What's the matter?
- It's OK.

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:07.580
Oh...

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:10.604
Come on, tell us,
what's the matter, darling?

01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:14.407
I got a lot of big
home-improvement plans.

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:16.779
Do up my flat.
I'm gonna paint my hallway.

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:19.740
Yes, Tom said that
you were a bit of an artiste.

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:22.540
Yeah, I, you know... I dabble.

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:24.801
No, I don't dabble.
Who am I trying to kid?

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:28.740
I got an A in art at A level.

01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:31.241
I don't remember
what I got in my A levels.

01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:34.100
I'm kidding you. I'm not that old.

01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:36.202
I got two Bs and a C, so.

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:39.328
No, I didn't. I got two Cs and a B.

01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:42.100
Anyway, I passed them all, so.

01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:44.700
- Well done.
- Thank you.

01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:49.620
Anyway, I'm so glad that you're a fan
of Six Billion People and You as well.

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:51.819
And I'm so sorry that
I was late to meet you.

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:54.740
But, actually, the reason
that I had to buy another copy

01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:57.859
was because I left my copy
for this woman on the train

01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:02.220
and she so needed to read it.
She was a very unhappy soul.

01:09:02.319 --> 01:09:06.689
You know, one of those sort of "lost
hope", "clock ticking" kind of women.

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:11.720
- Anyway, shall we do the lists?
- Yes, the lists, the lists.

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:18.042
I can't wait to see
what your favourite food is.

01:09:26.439 --> 01:09:27.725
Ready?

01:09:31.279 --> 01:09:32.406
I am so sorry about this.

01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:34.620
What are you talking about?
This is amazing.

01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:38.779
If I hadn't left her that book...
It's like the most epic love story ever.

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:42.202
And it means that I was right
and she was wrong. Taxi!

01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:49.100
- Where to?
- Shit, I have no idea.

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:50.260
Just call her.

01:09:50.359 --> 01:09:52.442
I don't have her number.
I have your number.

01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:54.860
- What's her name?
- Nancy. Nancy Patterson.

01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:57.340
- Look her up on Facebook.
- She's not on Facebook.

01:09:58.242 --> 01:09:59.340
Don't be ridiculous.

01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:03.060
Everyone's connected. You'll have
some mutual friends or something.

01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:04.605
You bloody genius.

01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:07.180
Bloomsbury Bowling Lanes, please.

01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:10.443
Good luck with the triathleting.
Thank you, Jessica!

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:24.340
- Sean... Is that my scarf?
- Where's Nancy?

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:27.540
I have to find her
and I think she's at her parents'.

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:29.210
Do you know where they live?

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:33.804
I know the exact Google map coordinates.

01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:48.140
Holy... You know what, Sean?
I'd be quite happy to take the train.

01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:50.402
- What's your plan?
- What's my plan?

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:52.045
To win her heart.

01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:55.180
- This isn't a power ballad.
- Well, it should be.

01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:58.500
Grand romantic gestures.
That's what it's all about.

01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:02.940
Declarations. Heart on the line.
Life-changing kind of stuff.

01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:06.020
That's what I was going for
back there in the toilets.

01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:09.203
Actions, you know. More than words.

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:11.730
Jesus!

01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:19.529
Taught myself to drive
with just my left hand.

01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:22.367
Pretty useful, I can tell you.

01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:35.860
- Are we here?
- Yep, we're here.

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:38.620
OK, OK, OK. Erm...

01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:42.167
- Oh, what number is it?
- 74.

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:46.340
Go, go, go! Bon chance, mon amigo.

01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:47.930
Whoo!

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:52.580
Idiot, idiot, idiot...

01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:54.260
I should have just said...

01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:56.820
"Don't go, come with me to the party."

01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:58.100
I can't hear her.

01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:00.660
Go easy, Nancy, it is a partition wall.

01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:03.100
- Something about a party?
- This party?

01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:05.540
And I was gonna bring him here
and everything.

01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:06.820
The man on the phone?

01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:08.620
The strange man you were on a date with?

01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:10.449
- You should have.
- Didn't go well?

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:12.403
No, it did go really well.

01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:17.608
- Oh, no, it's not a good thing.
- Boo, boo.

01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:23.660
Come on, my lovely,
just tell us what happened.

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:25.140
OK.

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:28.641
- I'll get that.
- OK. So...

01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:35.540
- What are you doing here?
- Is Nancy here?

01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:37.180
Are you the strippergram?

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:39.220
What? No, I'm not. What are you...?

01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:42.540
- Nancy, I had to come and find you.
- How did you...?

01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:46.300
- I couldn't just leave it like that.
- Oh, my God. Nancy, is this...

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:48.980
- Oh, it's marvellous.
- We've got a chair for you.

01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:50.860
- A chair? For me?
- Yeah.

01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:53.980
Oh, that sounds lovely.
Hello, nice to see you.

01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:59.406
- We've got a lot of people here.
- Oh, party time. Hello, everybody.

01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:02.660
Hello, I'm Sean.
Ooh, strawberries. Favourite!

01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:04.540
I loves me strawberries.

01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:05.700
No.

01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:11.100
Everybody, everyone!

01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:13.140
Everybody, everybody!

01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:15.060
- This is...
- It's Jack!

01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:17.660
He's looking for...
Who are you looking for again?

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:19.940
Nancy. Is this a 40th party?

01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:23.020
Nancy! Nancy, are you here?

01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:25.300
- I'm Nancy.
- I'm Nancy.

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:28.085
I'm Nancy!

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.980
No, no, no, no, no, you're not.
None of you are Nancy.

01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:34.900
Nancy is 34, not 15 or whatever.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.100
There's a girl being sick in the sink.
This is terrible.

01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:42.180
Come here, sweetheart. Let it all out.
There you go.

01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:47.020
Listen, Nancy is... she's got
very cool hair and a lovely face and...

01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:51.660
Come on, please. Nancy Patterson.
Anybody help me with Nancy Patterson?

01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:53.446
Wait! Nancy Patterson?

01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:56.220
- Yes!
- She used to be my old baby-sitter.

01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:59.180
- Can you take me to her?
- Yes, I can.

01:14:00.210 --> 01:14:02.980
Yes! Thank you! Thank you very much.

01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:05.540
Oh, we're all going, are we? OK.

01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:50.980
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:53.924
your attention, please.

01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:59.769
I'm just... just gonna say
a few words. Er...

01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:04.660
Er, I actually had
something prepared but...

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:07.300
I lost it. It's kind of a long story...

01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:09.260
Actually, I'm just gonna tell you,

01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:11.408
cos it's actually the reason
I was so late

01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:14.020
and the reason why this speech
is gonna be so rubbish.

01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:17.860
I met a man today.

01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:20.740
- Hello.
- No, not this man.

01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:23.660
I was standing underneath
the clock at Waterloo Station

01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:25.740
when a man called Jack

01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:28.580
mistook me for his blind date

01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:30.580
and instead of just saying,

01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:34.924
"Hey, you got the wrong girl,"
like a normal person, erm...

01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:40.100
I thought it was a good idea
to just pretend that I was his date.

01:16:40.572 --> 01:16:42.100
No, you didn't?

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:45.500
I did. I did. But, but...

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:49.980
You know, we went out and, you know,
for the first time in ages,

01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:53.260
I put myself out there,
and I took a chance,

01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:54.930
and I even got stronger thighs.

01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:59.700
Then Jack found out
I wasn't who I said I was,

01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:02.220
a 24-year-old triathlete by the way.

01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:03.860
- 24?
- Yeah.

01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:06.740
And so he went to go
and meet his real blind date.

01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:08.860
So blah, blah, blah, the end.

01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:19.290
No, don't be sad. God, I'm not sad.

01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:21.920
I'm a bit sad.

01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:26.140
Er, but I'm also quite proud of myself
because I tried.

01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:29.687
And, you know,
no, it didn't work out, but...

01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:34.540
I got a hint of what
could be out there for me.

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:36.005
You know,...

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.604
a fun,...

01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:43.300
loving, crazy, contradictory,

01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:46.020
long, happy life with someone.

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:47.900
Something that these two have had

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.500
since they first laid eyes on each other
40 years ago.

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:53.090
So, please...

01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:59.851
join me in toasting them and
wishing them a very happy anniversary.

01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:04.500
To my mum and dad. To Bert and Fran.

01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:07.580
- Mum and Dad.
- Bert and Fran.

01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:08.761
Bert and Fran.

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:21.020
I liked that speech. I liked it a lot.

01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:22.220
Cheers, Dad.

01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:25.164
- Much better than last year's.
- Yeah, that wasn't very...

01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:27.700
Come here.

01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:30.565
Stronger thighs. I'm so proud of you.

01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:32.260
Cheers, Elaine.

01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:34.220
Just keep on going, my darling.

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:36.540
- You'll get there in the end.
- Thanks, Mummy.

01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:38.860
So where's this Jack now?

01:18:39.959 --> 01:18:41.580
He's at the window.

01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:42.886
Nancy!

01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:46.740
Nancy, it's me. Nancy! Nanc...

01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:48.604
I'm gonna... I'm coming in.

01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:54.731
Sorry. Sorry.

01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:57.125
Hey.

01:18:57.800 --> 01:19:00.326
Nancy, I thought
you might want your speech.

01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:03.300
It's too late. I've...

01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:07.780
- No, do you want your speech, Nancy?
- Er... Yes.

01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:10.940
OK, good. Just be quiet
and let me give it to you, then.

01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:14.340
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls...

01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:19.540
...erm, and friends
and members of Nancy's family

01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:23.180
who I've never met before in my life.
This is...

01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:27.620
I met a girl today, the wrong girl,

01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:30.500
except she turned out
to be the right girl.

01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:33.060
And this girl who took a chance on me

01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:36.300
in the most bizarre
and romantic way possible

01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:39.449
wanted me to take a chance on her,
but, erm...

01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:43.340
I didn't, you know. I didn't. I blew it,

01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:47.809
like a stupid 40-year-old,
mid-life-crisis dickhead that I am.

01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:52.300
Which is why I sought help
from old beaus.

01:19:52.400 --> 01:19:56.340
Yes, you... not the most reliable
of sources, really. Whatever.

01:19:56.440 --> 01:20:00.500
But undeterred, I commandeered
these brilliant young drunks,

01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:03.740
because nothing was gonna stop me
from finding this girl

01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:06.844
and telling her what
I should have told her earlier on.

01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:13.540
Nancy, I am so bloody glad
you pretended to be my date today,

01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:15.220
because, if you hadn't,

01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:19.980
then I never would've heard
any of your amazing sex theories

01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:24.860
or... watched you trying to get
jalapeÃ±o out of your teeth

01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:29.180
or witnessed your very instinctive
firewoman skills.

01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:34.980
I would never have got to know
that muddy, beautiful triathlete face

01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:38.900
or witnessed that awesome,
highly competitive arse

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.020
as you were about to get another strike.

01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:44.580
In fact, if you hadn't have
pretended to be my date today,

01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:47.411
my day would have been utterly rubbish.

01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:54.024
And so, quite possibly,
would have been the rest of my life.

01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:57.601
Don't make those noises,
I'm right on the edge.

01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:01.180
Nancy, you said
I was an emotional jigsaw

01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:03.760
and that I should look
for the blue bits.

01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:07.526
I think you might be the blue bits,
Nancy.

01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:09.844
So what do you say?

01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:12.130
Quid pro quo?

01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:23.602
What does it say in
Six Billion People and You?

01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:25.524
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:30.160
Fuck the past.

01:21:30.830 --> 01:21:33.740
Fuck the past!

01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:35.410
Thank you. Excuse me.

01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:51.980
- Hands-arse.
- My hands aren't on your arse.

01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:53.684
I know.

01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:28.771
I'll send you a photo, Sean.

01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:30.721
Yes!

01:22:33.621 --> 01:22:35.137
Bye!
