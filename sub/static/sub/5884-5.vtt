AMC's Mad Men...</i>

00:03.224 --> 00:05.360
You said that I
should see a psychiatrist.

00:05.536 --> 00:07.896
Doctors must love that
they now have an answer

00:08.015 --> 00:09.528
for I don't know what's wrong.

00:09.683 --> 00:11.048
Jai Alai is leaving.

00:11.160 --> 00:12.529
- What?
- It's over.

00:12.624 --> 00:15.175
Debbie. In your
dorm, I know.

00:15.330 --> 00:19.967
He's dad! And he's never
coming back! And nobody cares!

00:20.087 --> 00:20.608
Stop it.

00:20.831 --> 00:24.088
Look, Pete, we're gonna
resign the Clearasil account.

00:24.223 --> 00:25.528
<i>I hate it here.</i>

00:25.631 --> 00:29.624
Every time I go around a corner
I keep thinking I'll see my dad.

In addition to the two major

01:22.907 --> 01:24.340
Smokers and cold sufferers,

01:24.408 --> 01:26.976
Is another group
that eats them as candy...

01:27.044 --> 01:29.712
The technical term
is "hypochondriacs."

Donald draper.

01:42.026 --> 01:43.560
Donald draper's office.

01:43.627 --> 01:46.062
<i>- Hello?</i>

01:46.130 --> 01:48.598
You said not to buzz you
all the time,

01:48.666 --> 01:50.266
But I don't know
how else to do this.

01:50.334 --> 01:53.169
- You have a phone call.
- You can buzz me
for a phone call.

01:53.237 --> 01:55.138
Things like coffee
after I've said no,

01:55.206 --> 01:57.140
You don't have to ask again.

01:57.208 --> 01:59.142
You're always asleep in here.

01:59.210 --> 02:01.711
Walter Hoffman
from "the times."
he's a reporter.

02:01.779 --> 02:04.380
- What's it regarding?
- You want me to go ask?

02:06.784 --> 02:08.985
I think we're done here.

02:11.055 --> 02:12.722
"New York times."

02:16.327 --> 02:19.395
<i>- This is don.
- Hi, it's Walter Hoffman
from "the New York times."</i>

02:19.463 --> 02:21.231
<i>I write
the advertising column.</i>

02:21.298 --> 02:23.800
I know who you are.
What can I do for you, Walter?

02:23.868 --> 02:25.401
I just wanted to know
if you'd heard

02:25.469 --> 02:27.370
That cutler, Gleason & Chaough
just signed clearasil.

02:30.474 --> 02:32.775
I don't keep track of accounts
once we resign them.

02:32.843 --> 02:35.578
I just think it's
kind of interesting
that first c.G.C.

02:35.646 --> 02:37.847
Takes the jai alai
association from you
and now this.

02:37.915 --> 02:40.316
<i>- How do you explain it?
- I don't think about it.</i>

02:40.384 --> 02:43.052
Well, I talked to Ted Chaough

02:43.120 --> 02:45.722
<i>And he said, "every time
don draper looks in his
rearview mirror,</i>

02:45.789 --> 02:47.156
<i>- He sees me."</i>

02:47.224 --> 02:49.259
<i>You have a partners' luncheon.</i>

02:49.326 --> 02:51.928
- What's your point?
- Do you
have a response?

02:51.996 --> 02:54.564
- On the record?
- Please.

02:54.632 --> 02:56.699
I've never heard of him.

02:56.767 --> 02:58.635
Anything else?

03:00.938 --> 03:02.772
No.
Have a good day.

03:08.512 --> 03:10.213
<i>This Selma thing
is not going away.</i>

03:10.281 --> 03:13.249
You still don't think
they need a civil rights law?

03:13.317 --> 03:15.451
They got what they wanted.
Why aren't they happy?

03:15.519 --> 03:18.087
Because Lassie
stays at the Waldorf
and they can't.

03:18.155 --> 03:20.056
Please tell me
I missed everything.

03:20.124 --> 03:22.659
I now call to order
a meeting of the partners.

03:22.726 --> 03:25.628
Sterling, Cooper,
draper, Pryce in attendance.

03:25.696 --> 03:27.163
Everybody.

03:27.231 --> 03:29.766
Very well then.
Mr. Campbell.

03:29.833 --> 03:32.735
Sector laxative
has finally agreed

03:32.803 --> 03:34.804
To produce
a television commercial
and test market it.

03:34.872 --> 03:36.606
How'd you ease them into it?

03:36.674 --> 03:39.075
Must've had to
loosen them up first.

03:39.143 --> 03:42.345
We've had that client
for 18 years, Roger.

03:42.413 --> 03:44.647
Pete has other news.

03:44.715 --> 03:47.984
A deerfield chum of mine
roped me into a dinner
for the Asia society,

03:48.052 --> 03:49.652
The result of which
was a series

03:49.720 --> 03:51.988
Of interesting phone calls
and one lunch

03:52.056 --> 03:53.823
Regarding the Honda
motorcycle company.

03:53.891 --> 03:55.692
They control over 50%
of the U.S. Market.

03:55.759 --> 03:58.061
I've seen them.
They're cute.

03:58.128 --> 04:00.196
They're miserable at Grey.

04:00.264 --> 04:02.398
Well, 50% of the market?
Who wouldn't be?

04:02.466 --> 04:04.467
"where's my other half?"

04:04.535 --> 04:08.972
They're taking meetings
and as of 9:00 this morning,
we're on the books.

04:09.039 --> 04:11.240
$3 million in
potential billings

04:11.308 --> 04:13.509
And they're venturing
into automobiles as well.

04:13.577 --> 04:14.911
When can you bring 'em in?

04:14.979 --> 04:17.079
Listen, let me spare you
the agony and the ecstasy

04:17.147 --> 04:19.082
<i>And tell you we are not
doing business with them.</i>

04:19.149 --> 04:20.850
Excuse me?

04:20.918 --> 04:22.852
Look, I don't expect you
to understand this

04:22.920 --> 04:24.354
Because you were a little boy,

04:24.421 --> 04:26.322
<i>But I used to be a man
with a lot of friends.</i>

04:26.390 --> 04:28.224
World war ii came

04:28.292 --> 04:30.226
And they were all killed
by your new yellow buddies.

04:34.365 --> 04:36.532
Look...

04:36.600 --> 04:39.335
If Bernbach can do business
with Volkswagen, we can do
business with anybody.

04:39.403 --> 04:41.004
The war is over, Roger.

04:41.071 --> 04:42.972
Why don't we just bring
Dr. Lyle Evans in here?

04:43.040 --> 04:44.340
That'll be enough of that.

04:47.177 --> 04:48.911
Lucky strike is great.
Meeting adjourned.

04:56.387 --> 04:58.287
We don't usually
put new business
to a vote, do we?

04:58.355 --> 05:01.624
Does anyone really
have a problem with this?

05:01.692 --> 05:03.393
No.
When can you
bring 'em in?

05:03.460 --> 05:05.928
Immediately, if possible.
I don't want to lose our spot.

05:05.996 --> 05:07.730
So far I've been
advised to read

05:07.798 --> 05:09.599
The "the chrysanthemum
and the sword."

05:09.667 --> 05:12.935
From what I can tell,
they have their own way
of doing business.

05:13.003 --> 05:15.505
Bert,
I'm hoping you'll help us
navigate these waters?

05:15.572 --> 05:18.141
I'll prepare
a few salient points.

05:18.208 --> 05:20.343
Keep Roger out of the loop.

05:20.411 --> 05:22.378
A rather exciting possibility.

05:22.446 --> 05:24.447
Good work.

05:24.515 --> 05:26.182
Joan, get everybody that book.

05:26.250 --> 05:28.851
I at least want them
to see it on people's desks.

05:28.919 --> 05:30.486
Who the hell
is Dr. Lyle Evans?

05:32.389 --> 05:35.124
I have no idea.

05:35.192 --> 05:37.627
The body of a 38-year-old
unitarian minister

05:37.695 --> 05:40.263
Was cremated within hours
of his death last night.

05:40.330 --> 05:42.598
He had been clubbed
by white men who resented...

05:42.666 --> 05:44.333
<i>- come in.</i>

05:46.603 --> 05:48.571
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:50.407 --> 05:52.809
- Sally?
- Hello.

05:52.876 --> 05:54.243
I brought my doctor Kit.

05:56.213 --> 05:57.847
Whoa.

05:59.249 --> 06:01.384
Okay, I'm gonna go.

06:01.452 --> 06:04.320
Enjoy yourself.
Which one is it?

06:04.388 --> 06:07.490
I mean, which restaurant
in case I need to reach you.

06:07.558 --> 06:09.125
Benihana's.

06:09.193 --> 06:10.760
You're going to see
a girl, aren't you?

06:10.828 --> 06:12.628
Yes I am.

06:12.696 --> 06:15.031
- What's her name?
- Bethany.

06:15.099 --> 06:16.699
I don't like that.

06:16.767 --> 06:18.534
Well, you don't have to.

06:18.602 --> 06:20.436
Bed by 9:00?

06:24.174 --> 06:26.175
How do I love thee?

06:26.243 --> 06:29.011
Let me count the ways.

06:37.087 --> 06:38.688
Jesus.
What did you do?

06:38.756 --> 06:41.124
<i>she looks like a mongoloid.</i>

06:41.191 --> 06:43.426
- Is it that bad?
- Bobby, go to bed.

06:43.494 --> 06:45.528
- Sally, get over here.
- No.

06:45.596 --> 06:47.964
<i>- good night.</i>

06:48.031 --> 06:50.099
Come over here.

06:51.368 --> 06:53.603
I'm not mad.
Come on.

07:01.578 --> 07:03.913
Your dad is gonna kill me.

07:05.516 --> 07:08.217
He's actually gonna kill me.

07:08.285 --> 07:10.620
You have short hair
and daddy likes it.

07:10.687 --> 07:12.688
That doesn't matter.
You're not allowed
to do this

07:12.756 --> 07:14.323
And you know that.

07:14.391 --> 07:17.059
Are you and daddy doing it?

07:17.127 --> 07:19.996
- What?
- I know what it is.

07:20.063 --> 07:22.765
I know that the man pees
inside the woman.

07:22.833 --> 07:24.734
Where did you hear that?

07:24.802 --> 07:26.502
A girl at school.

07:26.570 --> 07:29.105
You should talk to your mommy.

07:29.173 --> 07:30.773
I don't want to.

07:30.841 --> 07:32.241
Well, you don't need
to know right now,

07:32.309 --> 07:34.043
So stop changing the subject.

07:34.111 --> 07:36.746
I'm sorry.

07:36.814 --> 07:39.282
Do you understand
I'm in worse trouble
than you are?

07:40.784 --> 07:42.685
I just wanted to look pretty.

07:46.924 --> 07:48.658
Come on.

07:48.725 --> 07:50.259
We're gonna try
and fix this, okay?

08:03.207 --> 08:04.907
You're not impressed.

08:04.975 --> 08:06.976
My hair smells like
I've been frying chicken.

08:08.679 --> 08:10.179
stop it.

08:10.247 --> 08:13.115
This place is very expensive.

08:13.183 --> 08:15.952
That's not it.
It's just not very intimate.

08:16.019 --> 08:17.687
Three dates in five months?

08:17.754 --> 08:18.988
Don't think I don't know why.

08:19.056 --> 08:21.424
If it isn't
the inscrutable don draper.

08:21.491 --> 08:23.392
Ted.

08:23.460 --> 08:26.662
This is my wife Nan.

08:26.730 --> 08:29.599
- This is my friend Bethany.
- Ted Chaough.

08:29.666 --> 08:31.300
- Don draper.
- Pleasure.

08:31.368 --> 08:32.735
<i>Pleasure.</i>

08:32.803 --> 08:34.804
We just booked Howard Moses
to shoot clearasil.

08:34.871 --> 08:37.807
- You ever work with him?
- Not yet.

08:37.875 --> 08:40.643
I thought I was clever,
but it looks like you and I
had the same idea.

08:40.711 --> 08:43.044
- What are you talking about?
- What do you think?

08:43.113 --> 08:44.981
Honda?
You think the rest
of these tourists

08:45.048 --> 08:47.083
Are from j Walter Thompson?

08:47.150 --> 08:48.618
I suppose it's possible.

08:48.685 --> 08:50.586
The good news is it's
gonna be between us.

08:50.654 --> 08:52.288
The bad news is
the best man's gonna win.

08:54.291 --> 08:55.892
Enjoy your dinner.

08:55.959 --> 08:57.760
- We will.
- Nice to meet you.

09:01.198 --> 09:02.999
- What are you doing, Ted?
- Job.

09:06.570 --> 09:10.106
- Who's he?
- He's a fly I keep
swatting away.

09:12.009 --> 09:13.876
They haven't done half
of what we have.

09:13.944 --> 09:15.912
The minute he declared
himself the competition,

09:15.979 --> 09:18.114
Suddenly we were equal.

09:18.181 --> 09:20.783
Well, as far as I'm concerned,
he's no competition at all.

09:24.388 --> 09:26.389
Hello?

09:26.456 --> 09:28.391
We're not gonna let is
spoil our evening, are we?

09:30.961 --> 09:33.429
No.

09:33.497 --> 09:35.531
Do you know how to use those?

09:35.599 --> 09:37.633
Yes.

09:40.570 --> 09:41.971
Think you could teach me?

09:53.884 --> 09:55.351
What time did they go to bed?

09:55.419 --> 09:57.687
I'm really really sorry.

09:59.990 --> 10:01.924
- They still up?
- No.

10:01.992 --> 10:04.961
It's just...
I was watching TV with Bobby

10:05.028 --> 10:06.195
And I turned around
for a second

10:06.263 --> 10:07.997
And Sally cut her hair.

10:08.065 --> 10:09.432
What?

10:09.499 --> 10:11.968
It's pretty bad.

10:12.035 --> 10:13.970
I could've
just left them alone.

10:14.037 --> 10:16.672
She was in the bathroom.
I didn't know.

10:16.740 --> 10:18.641
You were supposed
to watch them.

10:18.709 --> 10:22.445
Don't.
I finally got her to sleep.

10:22.512 --> 10:24.847
Do you know the River of Shit

10:24.915 --> 10:26.215
I'm gonna get from her mother?

10:26.283 --> 10:28.851
I'm sorry about that.
I tried to fix it,

10:28.919 --> 10:30.987
But you'll probably
need to take her to
the beauty parlor.

10:31.054 --> 10:33.389
Why the hell would she do that?

10:33.457 --> 10:36.625
She probably wanted to look
older like Hayley mills.

10:36.693 --> 10:38.694
I don't know.

10:38.762 --> 10:41.330
- I really shouldn't.
- Consider it severance.

10:46.436 --> 10:48.070
- Look...
- I don't want
your advice, okay?

10:52.943 --> 10:54.777
Good night.

11:10.327 --> 11:11.827
it's probably
the kids.

11:16.500 --> 11:19.101
- Hi, mom.
- Did you have
a nice time?

11:19.169 --> 11:20.136
Yeah.

11:25.509 --> 11:27.076
Take that hat off.

11:30.647 --> 11:32.748
Let me explain, okay?

11:32.816 --> 11:34.750
- What the hell
happened to you?
- Calm down.

11:34.818 --> 11:36.185
- You cut her hair?
- No.

11:36.253 --> 11:37.920
- I cut it.
I'm sorry.
- Hey!

11:37.988 --> 11:39.789
Betty.

11:39.856 --> 11:42.091
- It was an accident.
- Jesus.

11:42.159 --> 11:43.759
Betts, is that necessary?

11:43.827 --> 11:45.428
I'm really really sorry.

11:45.495 --> 11:47.263
Damn right you're sorry.
Get up to your room.

11:47.330 --> 11:48.831
- Hold on.
- No, now.

11:49.966 --> 11:52.134
It'll be okay.

11:52.202 --> 11:54.770
Bobby, take your
little brother outside
and play.

12:00.210 --> 12:02.478
- You didn't have to hit her.
- You're right,

12:02.546 --> 12:04.113
<i>Because it doesn't
do anything!</i>

12:04.181 --> 12:07.116
You have picture day.

12:07.184 --> 12:09.151
<i>- Forget about
your sleepover.
- Kids do this.</i>

12:09.219 --> 12:12.054
- You never did this?
- All I wanted was to
have long hair.

12:12.122 --> 12:13.923
In fact when my mother
was mad at me,

12:13.990 --> 12:15.624
<i>She would threaten
to cut my hair.</i>

12:15.692 --> 12:17.993
- Where the hell were you?
- Look, it just happened.

12:18.061 --> 12:19.462
The sitter wasn't
paying attention.

12:19.529 --> 12:21.464
You know what?
I don't want to know
about your life.

12:21.531 --> 12:23.165
You can't even
watch them for a second.

12:23.233 --> 12:24.834
It's like leaving them
with nobody.

12:24.901 --> 12:27.036
Because you're
so good with them?

12:27.104 --> 12:29.271
Take her to the hairdresser.

12:29.339 --> 12:30.840
Goodbye.

12:35.278 --> 12:37.079
<i>- Betty.</i>

12:37.147 --> 12:38.447
Henry, I don't want to hear it.

12:40.217 --> 12:41.984
I want him dead!

12:42.052 --> 12:43.752
You don't think I feel that?

12:45.455 --> 12:47.556
I was divorced, Betty.

12:47.624 --> 12:50.593
My weekends with Ellie
were sacrosanct.

12:50.660 --> 12:52.595
I probably paid for
a building in play land

12:52.662 --> 12:53.796
And he couldn't
take a night off?

12:53.864 --> 12:55.731
And who knows
who he had watching her?

12:55.799 --> 12:57.967
Some secretary, another whore?

12:58.034 --> 13:00.035
But...

13:00.103 --> 13:04.306
That's him, not Sally.

13:04.374 --> 13:07.710
<i>Little girls do do this,</i>

13:07.777 --> 13:10.312
And not just ones
from broken homes.

13:13.083 --> 13:14.683
I know.

13:17.487 --> 13:19.155
I was impulsive.

13:19.222 --> 13:22.458
I'll apologize.

13:22.526 --> 13:24.527
Having had a girl this age,

13:24.594 --> 13:26.762
I can tell you that punishment
will only make this worse.

13:28.798 --> 13:30.799
So when you're
up there apologizing,

13:30.867 --> 13:33.235
You let her know
that she's going to go
to the hairdresser

13:33.303 --> 13:35.437
And she can go
on her sleepover.

13:36.740 --> 13:38.974
Reward her?

13:39.042 --> 13:41.043
- Really?
- Really.

13:49.686 --> 13:51.353
You're soft, you know that?

14:03.300 --> 14:05.434
There you are.
The Honda meeting's today.

14:05.502 --> 14:06.969
And before
you bite my head off,

14:07.037 --> 14:09.205
I'm up to date on the protocol
with the help of Cooper.

14:09.272 --> 14:12.308
We don't have to do anything
but avoid criticizing them
or giving advice.

14:12.375 --> 14:14.443
I ran into Ted Chaough.

14:14.511 --> 14:16.745
How are they in this thing
and how could you
not know that?

14:16.813 --> 14:18.480
This guy's drafting off of us.

14:18.548 --> 14:21.517
For the record,
it's j.W.T., c.G.C. And us.

14:21.551 --> 14:24.753
Now if you don't mind,
I have to get some gifts wrapped

14:24.821 --> 14:26.755
And get these chrysanthemums
out of the building.

14:26.823 --> 14:28.457
Apparently
they symbolize death.

14:28.525 --> 14:30.693
So much conflicting
information.

14:36.333 --> 14:37.433
Allow me to show you around.

14:40.770 --> 14:42.705
Our offices are probably more
modern than you've seen,

14:42.772 --> 14:44.974
But that's the kind
of company we are...
forward-thinking.

14:48.912 --> 14:51.413
This is what we call
the creative lounge.

14:51.481 --> 14:53.515
We can't tell you
how it happens,

14:53.583 --> 14:55.150
<i>But it does
happen here.</i>

14:55.218 --> 14:56.952
This is too difficult.

14:57.020 --> 14:59.521
Well, tell them something.

15:02.259 --> 15:04.693
This is Joan Harris,
our chief hostess.

15:04.761 --> 15:06.295
I'd like you to meet
Ichiro Kamura

15:06.363 --> 15:08.297
And Hachi Saito.

15:08.365 --> 15:11.500
Nice to meet you.
I hope no one's taken
you to Benihana.

15:11.568 --> 15:13.802
David Ogilvy.

15:13.870 --> 15:16.639
I've got a very good list
of steakhouses.
Just ask.

15:24.114 --> 15:25.814
Not very subtle, aren't they?

15:25.882 --> 15:27.850
No, they are not.

15:30.420 --> 15:33.589
We are most happily
looking forward

15:33.657 --> 15:35.591
To presentation.

15:35.659 --> 15:37.326
Not now, I hope.

15:38.495 --> 15:42.998
We want more driver
for motorcycle.

15:43.066 --> 15:45.601
And we shall endeavor
to make that happen.

15:45.669 --> 15:48.437
And now that we are finished,

15:48.505 --> 15:51.307
Please accept our modest gifts.

15:52.709 --> 15:54.843
I cannot accept.

15:54.911 --> 15:56.712
A small token.

15:59.082 --> 16:01.717
No thank you.

16:01.785 --> 16:03.719
Please.
You are our guests.

16:03.787 --> 16:05.421
Thank you.

16:07.857 --> 16:11.493
- Open it.
- No. Later, of course.

16:13.296 --> 16:14.963
It's a cantaloupe.

16:17.901 --> 16:19.601
Johnny Walker red.

16:25.542 --> 16:27.309
<i>- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.</i>

16:30.513 --> 16:34.149
I'm sorry.
I didn't know
this meeting was happening.

16:34.217 --> 16:36.852
Then again,
I know how some people
love surprises.

16:36.920 --> 16:39.221
I apologize, gentlemen,

16:39.289 --> 16:42.091
But for some reason
I was not informed.

16:42.158 --> 16:44.393
In fact, someone set
a long lunch for me
with Randolph.

16:44.461 --> 16:48.831
Well, it was last minute
and now, unfortunately,
drawn to a close.

16:48.898 --> 16:52.134
I have to warn you
they won't know it's over
until you drop the big one...

16:52.202 --> 16:53.836
Twice.

16:53.903 --> 16:55.404
The meeting is not over.

16:55.472 --> 16:58.173
We have yet
to present the rules.

16:58.241 --> 17:00.075
So now you're dictating terms.

17:05.848 --> 17:08.951
Mr. Kamura, Mr. Saito,
this is Roger sterling.

17:10.252 --> 17:12.988
This is their translator
Akira Takahashi.

17:14.656 --> 17:19.795
We give each firm $3,000

17:19.863 --> 17:23.699
For a competitive presentation.

17:23.767 --> 17:27.502
In this packet
are the conditions
for the competition.

17:27.569 --> 17:30.038
We don't want any conditions.
We want it to be unconditional.

17:32.208 --> 17:33.275
Akira, go ahead,
tell 'em what I said.

17:33.343 --> 17:35.444
Roger, stop it.

17:35.512 --> 17:37.813
- These men are our guests.
- I know exactly who
these men are.

17:37.881 --> 17:39.782
You think you can just
come in here and we'll
Fawn all over you?

17:39.849 --> 17:42.751
We beat you
and we'll beat you again.

17:42.819 --> 17:44.386
We don't want
any of your jap crap.

17:44.454 --> 17:48.023
<i>So sayonara.</i>

17:54.697 --> 17:58.100
If you could only know
my embarrassment.

18:00.603 --> 18:03.572
His wife's very sick.
He's been drinking a lot.

18:10.046 --> 18:11.814
You have our rules.

18:11.881 --> 18:14.016
We very much look forward
to your prestation.

18:27.664 --> 18:29.631
You don't get
to kill this account.

18:29.699 --> 18:32.034
- Well, you know how they are.
Maybe it'll kill itself.
- Enough.

18:32.101 --> 18:33.902
I'm not even talking
about money right now.

18:33.970 --> 18:36.405
I'm talking about
the kind of work you
could do for those people.

18:36.473 --> 18:38.040
Have you seen
that motorcycle?
They love design.

18:38.107 --> 18:39.775
As long as my name's
in that lobby,

18:39.843 --> 18:42.010
I get to choose whom
I do business with.

18:42.078 --> 18:44.446
I've got a lot better reasons
than you had with Jantzen.

18:44.514 --> 18:46.281
Jantzen was over.

18:46.349 --> 18:48.217
I made a pledge
to a lot of men
you'll never meet

18:48.284 --> 18:50.185
Not to do business with them.

18:50.253 --> 18:52.788
Christ on a cracker,
where do you get off?

18:52.856 --> 18:55.257
You know what?
You weren't there.
You weren't anywhere.

18:55.325 --> 18:56.692
I'm sorry you can't understand.

18:56.759 --> 18:58.360
It's been almost 20 years.

18:58.428 --> 19:00.796
Whether you like it or not,
the world has moved on.

19:00.864 --> 19:02.698
These are not the same people.

19:02.765 --> 19:04.566
How could that be?
I'm the same people!

19:04.634 --> 19:06.568
You don't think
I know what you're doing?

19:06.636 --> 19:08.804
You're wrapping yourself
in the flag

19:08.872 --> 19:10.806
So you can keep me
from bringing in an account

19:10.874 --> 19:12.741
Because you know
every chip I make,

19:12.809 --> 19:15.010
We become less dependent
on lucky strike

19:15.078 --> 19:17.045
And therefore
less dependent on you.

19:17.113 --> 19:19.181
- Why you little...
- Roger!

19:22.852 --> 19:24.353
Get him out of here.

19:24.420 --> 19:26.588
The rest of us are trying
to build something.

19:32.862 --> 19:34.563
He's right.

19:47.900 --> 19:49.834
Where would you hide a coin?

19:49.902 --> 19:52.037
You'd spend it, wouldn't you?

19:52.104 --> 19:54.573
Well, I do know where it is.
I'll tell you.

19:54.640 --> 19:56.141
<i>Then tell me.</i>

19:56.208 --> 19:57.442
<i>I'll make
a bargain with you.</i>

19:57.510 --> 20:00.512
Let these two go.
Keep me. I'll tell you.

20:03.249 --> 20:05.450
<i>- Promise.
- No.</i>

20:05.518 --> 20:07.285
<i>Then no deal.</i>

20:29.542 --> 20:31.910
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

20:31.978 --> 20:33.111
Laura.

20:35.147 --> 20:36.381
Go upstairs.

20:47.126 --> 20:49.494
Hold still.
I'll get it.

20:52.965 --> 20:55.667
What's the problem?
Is she sick?

20:55.735 --> 20:57.569
I would've come and gotten her.

20:57.637 --> 21:00.338
No.
The slumber party
ended early.

21:02.675 --> 21:03.908
I'd like to speak to Betty.

21:05.745 --> 21:07.679
Okay.
Honey?

21:11.183 --> 21:13.418
Is everything all right?

21:13.486 --> 21:15.453
No, it's not.

21:15.521 --> 21:18.056
Could you leave us
alone for a moment?

21:23.796 --> 21:26.531
I found Sally behaving
inappropriately.

21:26.599 --> 21:28.800
What'd she do?

21:30.469 --> 21:32.437
She was in our den on the couch

21:32.505 --> 21:34.239
Playing with herself.

21:35.508 --> 21:37.175
What?

21:37.243 --> 21:39.911
I don't know what goes on here,

21:39.979 --> 21:41.913
But that kind of behavior
is not allowed in my house

21:41.981 --> 21:44.049
And certainly not
in the presence
of my daughter.

21:47.053 --> 21:49.854
I am...

21:51.557 --> 21:53.525
Very sorry for this behavior

21:53.592 --> 21:55.593
And so is Sally.

21:58.197 --> 22:00.065
I would've done the same thing.

22:03.102 --> 22:04.736
Well...

22:04.804 --> 22:06.738
I'm sorry about that.

22:09.275 --> 22:11.342
I should go.

22:22.288 --> 22:24.055
What is wrong with you?

22:26.525 --> 22:28.560
You don't do those things.

22:28.627 --> 22:31.296
<i>You don't do them in private
and you especially don't
do them in public.</i>

22:34.567 --> 22:36.534
- You have nothing to say?
- I didn't do anything.

22:36.602 --> 22:38.937
Don't you dare lie to me.
I'll cut your fingers off.

22:39.004 --> 22:41.906
Go to bed.
We'll deal with
this in the morning.

22:46.979 --> 22:48.580
What happened?

22:53.018 --> 22:55.053
I'm mortified.

22:55.121 --> 22:58.089
I'm so embarrassed.

22:58.157 --> 23:00.592
what happened?

23:02.561 --> 23:04.362
She caught Sally...

23:06.499 --> 23:08.133
Playing with herself.

23:14.640 --> 23:16.641
What's wrong with her?

23:16.709 --> 23:18.643
That woman will tell everybody.

23:18.711 --> 23:22.947
why is she doing this?

23:23.015 --> 23:25.583
I told you if it got serious,

23:25.651 --> 23:27.685
Ere is a solution.

23:27.753 --> 23:30.488
I don't want to do that, Henry.

23:30.556 --> 23:32.624
It's one thing after another.

23:32.691 --> 23:34.659
What's wrong with her?

23:34.727 --> 23:38.363
Maybe it's time
we let a professional
answer that question.

23:38.430 --> 23:40.465
Henry...

23:42.701 --> 23:44.335
I went to a psychiatrist once.

23:46.605 --> 23:48.640
What?
Why?

23:48.707 --> 23:51.376
Because I was unhappy.

23:51.443 --> 23:53.178
And I don't think
it helps anything.

23:56.615 --> 23:58.750
I hate to think how much worse

23:58.818 --> 24:00.518
It would have been
for Eleanor without one.

24:00.586 --> 24:02.954
They train them just for kids.

24:03.022 --> 24:04.956
We got ours from the school.

24:05.024 --> 24:08.059
I'm saying this
not because I'm so sure

24:08.127 --> 24:09.861
There's something
wrong with her,

24:09.929 --> 24:11.896
But I think this is
very hard on you two.

24:15.968 --> 24:18.136
- When did you go?
- Years ago.

24:18.204 --> 24:20.071
I was bored.

24:22.174 --> 24:24.542
- Can we leave it at that?
- Of course.

24:49.802 --> 24:52.003
Miss Blankenship,
any luck on that call
to California?

24:52.071 --> 24:54.172
<i>I'm sorry.
No answer.</i>

24:54.240 --> 24:57.141
<i>Misters Peters and Pryce
to see you.</i>

24:57.209 --> 24:59.110
Send them in.

24:59.178 --> 25:03.448
I think we're okay,
but everything they do
is inside out.

25:03.515 --> 25:06.484
I got a call this morning
from my contact Masao

25:06.552 --> 25:09.320
Telling me that the meeting
was a Margaret Dumont-sized
disaster,

25:09.388 --> 25:11.956
But then... lane?

25:12.024 --> 25:14.158
Then nearly
20 minutes later
Masao called me

25:14.226 --> 25:16.828
And set a time
for our presentation.

25:16.896 --> 25:18.963
Look, there's probably
a guy like Roger
at every firm.

25:19.031 --> 25:21.232
They've outgrown it
and we haven't.

25:21.300 --> 25:24.569
Roger has something to say.

25:24.637 --> 25:28.873
<i>Mr. Cooper
and Mr. Sterling.</i>

25:30.209 --> 25:31.876
I realize that I
should not at this point

25:31.944 --> 25:34.445
Limit our potential clients
in any way.

25:34.513 --> 25:37.315
Next account,
no matter what it is,
you'll have my full support.

25:37.383 --> 25:38.716
And?

25:41.053 --> 25:43.154
Look, I know it's an old one

25:43.222 --> 25:45.790
And I have to let it go
just for my health alone,

25:45.858 --> 25:49.127
And, uh...
well, hell, it's over.

25:49.194 --> 25:52.196
Your contrition wouldn't
have gotten you out of this,
but you're lucky.

25:52.264 --> 25:54.699
They called and gave us
an appointment anyway.

25:54.767 --> 25:56.634
That means nothing.

25:56.702 --> 26:00.138
<i>- It's over.
- No, Bert, I said
we have a meeting.</i>

26:00.205 --> 26:04.876
It's most likely that
they are expecting us
to come in and resign.

26:04.944 --> 26:07.245
How do you get there from here?

26:09.315 --> 26:11.215
Have we received a gift?

26:13.052 --> 26:14.485
We should have
gotten one yesterday.

26:14.553 --> 26:16.487
I haven't.

26:16.555 --> 26:19.223
Miss Blankenship,
have I received any
packages today?

26:19.291 --> 26:20.625
<i>Yes.</i>

26:22.161 --> 26:23.461
Could you bring it in, please?

26:29.201 --> 26:32.203
It says "don" on it.

26:32.271 --> 26:33.938
Give it to him.

26:41.013 --> 26:44.382
"help me, Honda,
help help me, Honda.
Love, Teddy Chaouh."

26:46.852 --> 26:49.988
<i>- So there is no gift.
- That's how they work.</i>

26:50.055 --> 26:53.458
They want us to go in there,
bow down and beg them
to chop our heads off

26:53.525 --> 26:56.461
Because we disgraced ourselves.
How could you admire
these animals?

26:56.528 --> 26:58.129
Would you shut up?
They're businessmen

26:58.197 --> 26:59.630
And you insulted them
to their face.

26:59.698 --> 27:01.065
I'm expecting a child.

27:03.035 --> 27:05.803
Jai alai, clearasil, now Honda.

27:05.871 --> 27:07.939
Chaough wins another one
by default.

27:08.007 --> 27:11.042
- He's not going to win.
- I'm not wasting
that appointment.

27:11.110 --> 27:12.744
We need to do something

27:12.811 --> 27:14.579
That will make them
notice us... fireworks.

27:14.646 --> 27:16.581
- Do you have a campaign?
- No.

27:16.648 --> 27:19.550
But I will
and we're gonna shoot
a whole commercial for it...

27:19.618 --> 27:21.719
Something outrageous,
something graphic.

27:21.787 --> 27:23.988
The rules limit us
to boards and copy.

27:24.056 --> 27:26.424
It specifically says
no finished work.

27:26.492 --> 27:28.726
Because no one's ever won
an account by breaking
the rules?

27:28.794 --> 27:31.896
- Not with the Japanese.
- You're trying to tell me

27:31.964 --> 27:34.265
If we put our backs into this,
we couldn't turn their heads?

27:34.333 --> 27:36.901
$3,000 is all we have.

27:36.969 --> 27:39.837
That should buy
about four seconds
of your commercial.

27:39.905 --> 27:41.672
You don't think it's worth
going out of pocket?

27:41.740 --> 27:43.074
What pocket?

27:43.142 --> 27:45.743
A spec commercial
will eat up our ability

27:45.811 --> 27:47.612
To pitch anymore
new business this year.

27:47.679 --> 27:49.347
It's only March.

27:49.415 --> 27:51.816
I would be willing to risk
bankrupting this place

27:51.884 --> 27:53.818
If I didn't think
we were already dead
in the water...

27:55.287 --> 27:57.188
But we are.

28:00.459 --> 28:01.859
Come on, Bert.

28:17.966 --> 28:20.434
- Hello?
- Am I catching you alone?

28:22.537 --> 28:24.071
What do you want?

28:24.139 --> 28:26.307
I prefer not to talk
about this on the phone,

28:26.374 --> 28:29.009
But it's our feeling
that Sally needs to see
a psychiatrist.

28:29.077 --> 28:30.444
<i>Our feeling.</i>

28:30.512 --> 28:33.314
Why, because she cut her hair?

28:33.381 --> 28:35.416
No, it's more
serious this time.

28:35.483 --> 28:37.518
I'm telling you
because I found someone
through the school...

28:37.585 --> 28:39.620
A children specialist.

28:39.688 --> 28:41.488
What exactly did she do?

28:41.556 --> 28:42.923
She set the house on fire?

28:42.991 --> 28:45.726
She was masturbating, don,
in front of a friend.

28:45.794 --> 28:47.261
Does that seem normal to you?

28:47.329 --> 28:50.397
Really?

28:50.465 --> 28:52.066
Boy or girl?

28:52.133 --> 28:54.368
Jesus.
What's the difference?

28:54.436 --> 28:56.970
The doctor needs
to speak with us,

28:57.038 --> 28:58.839
Individually of course.

28:58.907 --> 29:01.275
So you've made up your mind.
Why are you even calling me?

29:01.343 --> 29:03.844
She's out of control.
I thought you'd be concerned.

29:03.912 --> 29:05.879
I am.
I just don't know
that she needs a doctor.

29:05.947 --> 29:07.381
<i>Can't you talk to her?</i>

29:07.449 --> 29:09.683
You think I want this?
I don't know what else to do.

29:09.751 --> 29:11.885
You know what kind
of little girls do that?

29:11.953 --> 29:14.321
- Fast ones.
- She's 10 years old.

29:14.389 --> 29:15.856
Well, don't think
she doesn't understand.

29:15.924 --> 29:17.624
She understands
a lot of things
thanks to you.

29:17.692 --> 29:20.294
- What?
- I don't care what you do,

29:20.362 --> 29:21.695
But just don't do it
with her there.

29:21.763 --> 29:23.964
You brought another man
into your bed,

29:24.032 --> 29:26.066
<i>Into her house.
You don't think she
noticed that?</i>

29:26.134 --> 29:29.670
One man, don.
How many have you had
in your bachelor pad?

29:29.738 --> 29:31.772
That girl you had
watching her?
Who's she?

29:31.840 --> 29:34.742
- I'm married.
- Jesus. You ever
hear yourself?

29:34.809 --> 29:37.411
I'll give the information
to your secretary.

29:37.479 --> 29:39.146
<i>- Perfect.
- Good night.</i>

29:55.630 --> 29:57.431
- Oh-ho!
- Yes!

30:00.435 --> 30:03.704
Have you seen these?
I'm trying to figure out
what makes it work.

30:03.772 --> 30:05.239
<i>I'm still wondering
what makes you work.</i>

30:05.306 --> 30:07.841
Joan, Pete, Peggy.

30:11.679 --> 30:13.947
Don't touch it.
I want to see how
long it goes.

30:22.257 --> 30:23.690
What's wrong?

30:26.795 --> 30:28.695
"a man is shamed"

30:28.763 --> 30:30.664
By being openly ridiculed
and rejected.

30:30.732 --> 30:32.332
"It requires an audience."

30:32.400 --> 30:34.568
What is that?
Fortune cookie?

30:34.636 --> 30:36.336
It's from that book
you were all supposed to read.

30:36.404 --> 30:38.005
Oh.

30:38.072 --> 30:39.773
Apparently making a commercial
for the Honda pitch

30:39.841 --> 30:41.875
- Would bankrupt us.
- And it's against the rules.

30:41.943 --> 30:43.477
Forget the rules
for a second.

30:43.545 --> 30:45.245
C.G.C. Is
the same size as us.

30:45.313 --> 30:47.548
If we can't afford to do
anything, they can't.

30:47.615 --> 30:49.716
So everybody's bankrupt.

30:49.784 --> 30:51.418
Chaough said he's
in my rearview mirror.

30:51.486 --> 30:53.487
Guess what?

30:53.555 --> 30:55.489
I'm gonna make a left turn
right off a cliff.

30:57.826 --> 31:00.461
All I have to do
is let chaough think
I'm making a commercial

31:00.528 --> 31:02.529
And he'll make one.

31:02.597 --> 31:04.665
- So what's our campaign?
- We don't have a campaign.

31:04.732 --> 31:06.333
We're not doing anything.

31:06.401 --> 31:07.968
He just needs to think we are.

31:08.036 --> 31:10.637
So what?
He's going to
make a commercial.

31:10.705 --> 31:12.639
What if it's fantastic?
He'll win the account.

31:12.707 --> 31:16.777
Let me worry about that.

31:16.845 --> 31:20.247
I know she's the best rep
there is, but she told me
you were unavailable.

31:20.315 --> 31:22.916
I am.
Clearasil doesn't wrap
until Friday night,

31:22.984 --> 31:26.687
But maybe
you could push it.
It sounds interesting.

31:28.389 --> 31:30.123
Well, Howard,
I'm going to insist

31:30.191 --> 31:32.159
- On your discretion
at this point.
- Of course.

31:33.761 --> 31:35.395
It's going to be
four to five days.

31:35.463 --> 31:37.397
<i>- just a minute.</i>

31:37.465 --> 31:38.866
<i>Could you get the door?</i>

31:44.439 --> 31:47.007
I'm sorry.
I thought we'd
put this in here.

31:47.075 --> 31:48.842
Later.

31:48.910 --> 31:50.377
- Sorry about that.
- That's okay.

31:53.648 --> 31:55.916
- You didn't see that.
- No, of course not.

31:55.984 --> 31:58.352
- That's draper, isn't it?
- Yes.

31:58.419 --> 32:01.655
Anyway, it's 12 scenes.

32:01.723 --> 32:03.590
One of them obviously
has a crowd.

32:03.658 --> 32:06.026
You'll need to figure out
how to shoot on the Staten
island ferry,

32:06.094 --> 32:09.062
To it and from it
and how you're going
to close fifth Avenue.

32:09.130 --> 32:12.299
I'll be honest.
I'd give anything to do this,

32:12.367 --> 32:14.968
But right now I'm too busy.

32:15.036 --> 32:17.738
Anyway, you know
I'd much rather shoot
your Honda commercial.

32:17.805 --> 32:19.973
I don't have one.

32:20.041 --> 32:22.910
Why the hell
did they call you in?

32:22.977 --> 32:25.746
- They know I've got you booked.
- How can they afford that?

32:25.813 --> 32:28.115
Get that kid in here
who worked for draper.

32:30.818 --> 32:32.319
Anticipation.

32:32.387 --> 32:34.154
Suspense.

32:39.994 --> 32:41.962
A Honda tears through
a subway tunnel,

32:42.030 --> 32:43.931
The train nipping at its tire.

32:43.998 --> 32:46.433
he keeps looking back,

32:46.501 --> 32:49.002
The train roaring at him.

32:49.070 --> 32:50.470
He's wearing a racing helmet.

32:50.538 --> 32:52.005
And then you see him
head up the steps.

32:52.073 --> 32:54.508
- Can they do that?
- Howard'll make them do that.

32:54.576 --> 32:56.710
Then he gets out
on the sidewalk,

32:56.778 --> 32:59.346
Stops, kicks down
the kickstand,

32:59.414 --> 33:01.481
Takes off the helmet

33:01.549 --> 33:03.817
And he is a she...
California blonde.

33:03.885 --> 33:06.153
Hands down,
that's your best idea.

33:06.220 --> 33:08.622
We'll bring
a guy to the pitch
in a racing helmet,

33:08.690 --> 33:11.158
Have him take it off...
it's a sexy girl.

33:11.225 --> 33:13.894
- What?
- We only have $3,000.

33:13.962 --> 33:17.497
<i>- We're not shooting Shit.</i>

33:17.565 --> 33:20.200
How long did you
work for draper?

33:20.268 --> 33:22.369
A little over two years.

33:22.437 --> 33:24.738
When you were in a bake-off,
he ever break the rules?

33:24.806 --> 33:27.341
I don't know.
He wouldn't have
shared it with me,

33:27.408 --> 33:29.776
But definitely
doesn't think the
rules apply to him.

33:29.844 --> 33:31.445
He once disappeared
for a month.

33:31.512 --> 33:33.213
Does he like to play games?

33:33.281 --> 33:36.350
He's always thinking
on the edges of
where you are.

33:36.417 --> 33:40.053
I don't know.
He's... he's a genius.

33:40.121 --> 33:43.657
You ever talk that way
about me?

33:43.725 --> 33:45.692
Why don't you go work
for your boyfriend?
Get out.

33:47.362 --> 33:49.162
And give me 20 different words
for "pimples." out!

33:52.533 --> 33:55.102
Call Barbara about
Howard here and contact
the city of New York.

33:55.169 --> 33:56.737
We need a subway.

34:20.762 --> 34:22.329
How are you doing?

34:23.998 --> 34:25.766
Excuse me.
Can I help you?

34:25.833 --> 34:27.868
We're, uh...
we're late.

34:27.935 --> 34:29.936
No you're not.
Closed set.

34:30.004 --> 34:31.505
Sorry.

34:58.191 --> 35:00.926
oh, you scared me.

35:02.596 --> 35:04.397
Who are you feeding today?

35:06.133 --> 35:08.434
Royal traveller Samsonite.

35:12.139 --> 35:13.606
This is like a coconut.

35:13.673 --> 35:15.541
Be careful.

35:18.078 --> 35:19.779
There was a trapeze artist.

35:19.846 --> 35:22.248
He made more in an hour here

35:22.315 --> 35:23.616
Than he makes in a week
at the circus.

35:26.353 --> 35:28.053
Have you ever had this?
Sake?

35:28.121 --> 35:29.889
No.

35:33.160 --> 35:35.494
I don't know how people drink
the way you do around here.

35:35.562 --> 35:37.196
I'd fall asleep.

35:41.968 --> 35:43.969
What's it like being
a trapeze artist?

35:44.037 --> 35:46.305
Or did you just ask him
about his luggage?

35:48.241 --> 35:49.708
It's good.

35:51.411 --> 35:53.412
He was surprisingly modest.

35:53.480 --> 35:55.881
His father does it
better than him.

35:55.949 --> 35:57.616
He actually said that?

35:57.684 --> 35:59.452
Best part of my job.

35:59.519 --> 36:02.321
You'd be surprised
what people will say
to an interested stranger.

36:03.957 --> 36:06.025
Why does everybody need
to talk about everything?

36:06.092 --> 36:07.893
I don't know but they do.

36:07.961 --> 36:10.763
And no matter what happens
while they're talking,

36:10.831 --> 36:12.198
When they're done
they feel better.

36:15.101 --> 36:16.669
You have kids?

36:18.371 --> 36:20.005
No.

36:20.073 --> 36:21.974
Where's your husband?

36:25.612 --> 36:27.780
I'm not married.

36:27.848 --> 36:30.449
But you're wearing...
you're divorced?

36:30.517 --> 36:31.917
No.

36:33.553 --> 36:35.588
This is just a stop sign.

36:37.357 --> 36:38.991
I walk into a lot of offices

36:39.059 --> 36:42.027
And it's helped me avoid
a lot of distracting
conversations.

36:42.095 --> 36:43.696
But you told me.

36:46.967 --> 36:48.234
<i>Do you have children?</i>

36:48.301 --> 36:50.269
I do.

36:50.337 --> 36:51.637
Two boys and a girl...

36:51.705 --> 36:53.439
One and a half, seven and 10.

36:55.141 --> 36:57.209
I'm sure it must be hard
to be apart.

36:59.145 --> 37:00.479
I don't see them enough.

37:01.982 --> 37:03.482
And when I do,
I don't know what to do.

37:05.185 --> 37:07.286
When I drop them off
I feel relieved.

37:09.523 --> 37:11.156
And then I miss them.

37:13.326 --> 37:14.660
I'm sorry.

37:18.064 --> 37:19.865
It is not going well.

37:21.635 --> 37:25.271
My ex-wife thinks
my daughter needs
a psychiatrist.

37:27.874 --> 37:30.409
And I assume
you're against that.

37:33.480 --> 37:35.814
I don't know.

37:35.882 --> 37:38.617
Well, I can't say there's
any evidence to support this,

37:38.685 --> 37:41.754
But I'm pretty sure
if you love her and
she knows it,

37:41.821 --> 37:43.389
She'll be fine.

37:50.964 --> 37:52.464
Well, thank you for the drink.

37:55.502 --> 37:57.102
I should be going.

37:57.170 --> 37:59.705
Fake dinner plans
with your fake husband?

38:02.475 --> 38:03.842
Good night.

38:10.884 --> 38:12.384
Now from what you told me
on the phone

38:12.452 --> 38:14.486
This year s been quite
eventful for your family.

38:14.554 --> 38:17.256
I know it seems fast,

38:17.324 --> 38:20.526
But I felt children
had no concept of time

38:20.594 --> 38:22.428
And Henry's
really taken to them.

38:22.495 --> 38:25.731
He has a daughter
and she's such an
exceptional young woman.

38:27.867 --> 38:29.768
Well, if you choose
to have Sally work with me,

38:29.836 --> 38:31.403
I'd like to meet her

38:31.471 --> 38:33.706
And then interview you
and your ex-husband.

38:33.773 --> 38:35.474
Well, I doubt
you'll ever meet him.

38:35.542 --> 38:37.476
That's his level of interest.

38:40.013 --> 38:43.248
Is this most recent incident
of the most concern for you?

38:44.884 --> 38:46.852
Well, I know the divorce
is mostly to blame,

38:46.920 --> 38:50.255
But she's been different
ever since my father died.

38:52.058 --> 38:53.525
He lived with us briefly.

38:55.328 --> 38:56.795
They were very close.

39:03.737 --> 39:05.204
I wish he had met Henry.

39:06.706 --> 39:07.940
That's my husband.

39:08.008 --> 39:10.275
They would've gotten along.

39:12.712 --> 39:14.713
My mother...
I don't know.

39:14.781 --> 39:16.915
My goodness, if I had done
what Sally did...

39:16.983 --> 39:19.084
My mother was
very strict about it.

39:19.152 --> 39:22.788
My brother, he saved his money

39:22.856 --> 39:24.523
And bought a nudist magazine

39:24.591 --> 39:27.126
And showed it to me.

39:27.193 --> 39:29.061
My mother found it
and she nailed it

39:29.129 --> 39:31.530
To his bedroom door.

39:31.598 --> 39:34.033
What about you?

39:38.972 --> 39:41.640
I was private
and mostly outgrew it.

39:41.708 --> 39:43.342
I see.

39:45.311 --> 39:47.346
- Dr. Keener...
- call me Dr. Edna.

39:47.414 --> 39:48.580
That's what the kids do.

39:51.785 --> 39:53.552
Of course I know
children do this...

39:53.620 --> 39:55.821
But not in public.

40:00.360 --> 40:02.027
I feel like Sally did this

40:02.095 --> 40:04.229
To punish me somehow
for everything.

40:06.466 --> 40:08.767
That must be
a terrible feeling.

40:08.835 --> 40:10.302
It is.

40:12.839 --> 40:14.773
You have to believe me.
I had to get divorced.

40:17.143 --> 40:20.212
I felt it best for them
to have some stability
in their life.

40:20.280 --> 40:23.649
In the end,
she doesn't understand
that it'll be better.

40:26.352 --> 40:28.821
Sounds to me
like it wouldn't be bad
for you to talk to someone.

40:30.657 --> 40:32.324
No. No, I'm okay.

40:34.761 --> 40:38.831
Well, I think
it'd be helpful if you and I
were to meet once a month

40:38.898 --> 40:41.700
Just to keep up
with Sally's progress.

40:41.768 --> 40:45.237
Will you tell me what
she talks about in here?

40:45.305 --> 40:46.972
No.

40:47.040 --> 40:48.474
And the other way
around as well.

40:48.541 --> 40:51.710
No, that's better.

40:51.778 --> 40:54.079
So I think we should start
at four days a week.

40:54.147 --> 40:56.415
Let me go get my date book.

41:27.776 --> 41:30.011
- Where's your film?
- What film?

41:30.078 --> 41:31.579
That's how you're shaking it?

41:31.647 --> 41:33.948
- I heard it stunk.
- We didn't make one.

41:34.016 --> 41:36.751
- It's too expensive.
- Well, then you're out
of luck, Donny.

41:36.819 --> 41:39.120
'cause I sure wouldn't
want to follow what
I showed them

41:39.188 --> 41:40.788
With a speech
and a couple of posters.

41:55.938 --> 41:58.806
Sterling Cooper draper Pryce.

41:58.874 --> 42:00.341
Donald draper.

42:01.777 --> 42:03.644
Where is Mr. Cooper

42:03.712 --> 42:05.547
And Mr. Campbell?

42:05.548 --> 42:06.548
And white hair.

42:06.949 --> 42:09.050
- And sterling?
- They couldn't make it.

42:11.053 --> 42:12.820
You created this set of rules

42:12.888 --> 42:14.856
To even the playing field.

42:14.923 --> 42:18.059
It says specifically
no finished work.

42:20.229 --> 42:23.297
I understand not everybody
has observed this.

42:23.365 --> 42:24.799
I don't really
want to be a part

42:24.867 --> 42:26.767
Of a competition like that

42:26.835 --> 42:28.369
So I'm withdrawing us.

42:29.908 --> 42:31.037
What'd he say?

42:31.880 --> 42:34.438
He said he is resigning.

42:34.931 --> 42:36.388
You did not honor
your own rules.

42:45.888 --> 42:48.456
Thank you for thinking of us.

42:48.524 --> 42:50.258
Good afternoon.

43:01.370 --> 43:05.106
The voiceover announcer
for lucky has a severe case
of chest congestion.

43:05.173 --> 43:07.074
Get the boy wonder on it.

43:07.142 --> 43:09.410
- Greg, accounts?
- No, Pete.

43:09.478 --> 43:12.680
Have a drink.
It'll make me look younger.

43:12.748 --> 43:16.117
I'm not gonna watch you
feel sorry for yourself.

43:16.184 --> 43:18.152
I feel sorry for all of us.

43:18.220 --> 43:20.588
Don's over there
surrendering right now.

43:20.656 --> 43:22.557
Would you stop?

43:24.993 --> 43:27.728
There was a kid
on the destroyer...

43:27.796 --> 43:29.897
P.F.C. Brycen...

43:29.965 --> 43:31.966
And he was
an honest-to-goodness poet.

43:32.034 --> 43:33.834
- And then during...
- Roger.

43:33.902 --> 43:35.603
I don't want to hear it.

43:35.671 --> 43:38.339
My husband's gonna be
in uniform any day now.

43:38.407 --> 43:40.474
How do you think
he's gonna feel

43:40.542 --> 43:44.178
When one day
some Pete Campbell goes
to some Vietnamese doctor?

43:46.582 --> 43:49.050
Since when is forgiveness
a better quality
than loyalty?

43:51.620 --> 43:53.454
Roger, I know it was awful

43:53.522 --> 43:57.491
And I know it'll never seem
like it was that long ago,

43:57.559 --> 44:01.062
But you fought
to make the world
a safer place and you won

44:01.129 --> 44:03.130
And now it is.

44:03.198 --> 44:04.966
You think so?

44:05.033 --> 44:06.500
Really?

44:06.568 --> 44:08.002
I have to.

44:09.838 --> 44:11.672
- Anything else?
- No.

44:20.349 --> 44:23.184
Good afternoon.
Your daughter's
psychiatrist called.

44:25.420 --> 44:27.421
Lower your voice, please.

44:39.768 --> 44:42.336
<i>- congratulations.</i>

44:42.404 --> 44:44.271
I just spoke
with Mr. Saito.

44:44.339 --> 44:47.208
It seems Honda was never
going to leave Grey,

44:47.275 --> 44:50.745
But of the three princes
invited to meet the princess,

44:50.812 --> 44:52.546
You were the most charming.

44:52.614 --> 44:55.249
We're first in the door
on their little car.

44:55.317 --> 44:58.185
- And c.G.C.?
- Out of the running.

44:58.253 --> 44:59.654
We killed him.

45:01.456 --> 45:04.725
That stunt you pulled
was unseemly.

45:06.695 --> 45:08.663
- The only reason
I let you continue...
- let me?

45:10.799 --> 45:13.267
Do you think Joan
can rent stage space
without talking to me?

45:15.037 --> 45:17.104
I let you

45:17.172 --> 45:19.106
Because I realized
that our financial future

45:19.174 --> 45:21.709
Was related to
Mr. Chaough's demise.

45:21.777 --> 45:23.811
So what is it?

45:23.879 --> 45:26.013
Are you thanking me
or reprimanding me?

45:26.081 --> 45:28.416
Let's not pretend
like this wasn't
a big risk.

45:28.483 --> 45:30.184
We're thanking you.

45:32.754 --> 45:34.488
Send over what
you have on the car.

45:34.556 --> 45:37.858
It redlines at 9,500rpm,

45:37.926 --> 45:40.361
But it only has 57 horsepower.

45:40.429 --> 45:43.864
- What?
- It's a motorcycle
with doors.

45:45.400 --> 45:47.601
The nice thing is
it has windows

45:47.669 --> 45:51.038
So you can see your brains
spatter against it
when it crashes.

45:51.106 --> 45:52.673
They're working on it.

45:52.741 --> 45:54.241
Cheers.

46:07.155 --> 46:08.489
Hello, Sally.

46:10.759 --> 46:12.760
I'm Dr. Edna.

46:12.828 --> 46:14.161
Why don't you come inside?

46:58.162 --> 47:00.162
