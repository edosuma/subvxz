02:05.925 --> 02:07.961
[man] You should always
be careful what you wish for.

02:11.797 --> 02:15.702
There was a time when all I ever
wanted was to be a better boxer.

02:23.741 --> 02:25.477
But I got a lot more
than I wished for.

02:27.979 --> 02:29.348
[panting]

03:24.902 --> 03:29.941
In so many ways, boxing is just an
accepted way of hurting others.

03:31.577 --> 03:33.712
Perhaps that was all
I ever wanted from it.

03:44.021 --> 03:44.923
Hey.

03:46.125 --> 03:47.023
Yeah?

03:47.025 --> 03:48.894
I see you've been
working out pretty hard.

03:50.763 --> 03:52.028
Well, I try.

03:52.030 --> 03:54.067
You lost it a bit
with that punchbag.

04:00.938 --> 04:02.539
You saw that?

04:02.541 --> 04:04.009
You're not professional,
are you?

04:05.443 --> 04:07.143
No.

04:07.145 --> 04:08.712
You could be.

04:08.714 --> 04:11.616
- Look, I'm not sure...
- I have something that can help.

04:15.019 --> 04:17.055
- Like what?
- Would you be interested?

04:18.555 --> 04:20.358
- Maybe. But, depends...
- Here.

04:23.528 --> 04:24.429
Call me.

04:25.463 --> 04:26.732
If you're interested.

04:28.100 --> 04:29.369
Okay, thanks.

04:31.068 --> 04:31.970
I have to go.

04:33.205 --> 04:34.507
Get in touch.

05:24.121 --> 05:25.689
How did it go?

05:25.691 --> 05:26.691
Fine.

05:27.859 --> 05:29.494
Is the bait
on its way to him?

05:30.828 --> 05:31.797
Yes.

05:32.797 --> 05:33.833
Show me.

05:37.503 --> 05:38.634
Want to try one?

05:38.636 --> 05:40.472
Don't be funny.

05:41.539 --> 05:43.241
The joke's not on you, Jaeger.

05:46.244 --> 05:48.213
This is the last thing
I'll ask of you.

05:49.313 --> 05:50.549
Time is running out.

05:52.551 --> 05:53.786
He isn't going to like it.

05:57.256 --> 05:59.125
He'll have to earn his place.

06:00.958 --> 06:03.028
What we'll put him through
will mold him.

06:06.999 --> 06:08.266
You'll get what you want.

06:54.145 --> 06:55.881
[panting]

07:37.321 --> 07:40.191
[indistinct talking on TV]

07:46.230 --> 07:47.332
[clattering]

07:51.436 --> 07:53.371
[indistinct talking
on TV continues]

08:28.140 --> 08:29.175
[clattering]

08:54.800 --> 08:56.332
Be careful with those.

08:56.334 --> 08:57.433
They're shipping
them off tomorrow.

08:57.435 --> 09:00.102
- I want them looking presentable.
- [phone rings]

09:00.104 --> 09:01.840
- Whoops.
- [phone continues ringing]

09:08.879 --> 09:10.447
[man] Mr. Fader?

09:10.449 --> 09:11.784
Speaking.

09:12.950 --> 09:15.720
Ah. It's you I met
outside the gym.

09:16.854 --> 09:17.987
Yeah.

09:17.989 --> 09:19.225
Did you get my gifts?

09:20.258 --> 09:21.326
Did they work for you?

09:22.359 --> 09:23.662
Yeah, I think so.

09:24.796 --> 09:27.266
You know,
I'd really like some more.

09:28.800 --> 09:30.132
When do you want them?

09:30.134 --> 09:32.068
Whenever you can drop 'em.

09:32.070 --> 09:33.138
Fine.

10:17.014 --> 10:19.384
[inhales and exhales deeply]

10:23.053 --> 10:24.856
This all feels so sudden.

10:26.792 --> 10:28.827
Sudden for us maybe.

10:30.494 --> 10:32.030
But not for Kaufman.

10:33.798 --> 10:36.268
He's asked me to keep an eye
on the new recruit.

10:37.369 --> 10:38.870
Get him through this.

10:41.505 --> 10:43.241
You know who found him,
don't you?

10:44.276 --> 10:46.245
Yes. It was her, wasn't it?

10:47.345 --> 10:48.814
That must be
why Kaufman hired her.

10:51.016 --> 10:52.852
Why else would he hire
someone so young?

10:54.920 --> 10:57.289
I don't know that age has ever
mattered in this business.

10:58.389 --> 11:00.024
Some of us started young.

11:03.628 --> 11:06.128
No, I think he's just
moving things forward,

11:06.130 --> 11:07.999
and bringing her in
was part of that.

11:12.838 --> 11:15.775
He's delivered in a way that
means more than you realize.

11:17.274 --> 11:20.178
If Kaufman wants advice,
he'll go to her.

11:22.880 --> 11:24.282
She's earned his trust.

11:27.585 --> 11:29.053
But has she earned yours?

11:30.654 --> 11:32.423
I trust Kaufman.

11:48.672 --> 11:50.441
[seagulls squawking]

12:27.211 --> 12:28.446
[keys jingling]

13:07.484 --> 13:09.986
What the fuck are you doing?

13:09.988 --> 13:11.090
You called earlier.

13:13.057 --> 13:16.361
The front door was open. I
thought it best to just come in.

13:17.995 --> 13:19.130
Is that okay, Stanley?

13:20.264 --> 13:21.366
How do you know my name?

13:22.433 --> 13:24.266
You told me outside the gym.

13:24.268 --> 13:25.270
Don't you remember?

13:27.504 --> 13:28.439
No, I don't remember.

13:29.474 --> 13:31.009
What do you do exactly?

13:32.009 --> 13:33.244
I'm unemployed.

13:36.580 --> 13:38.647
I was a surgical assistant.

13:38.649 --> 13:39.584
And?

13:40.652 --> 13:43.453
And I got laid off recently.

13:43.455 --> 13:45.023
Well, what kind of work
are you looking for?

13:46.157 --> 13:47.225
What makes you ask that?

13:48.493 --> 13:50.028
Maybe I could help you again.

13:51.763 --> 13:53.264
May have a job for you.

13:55.200 --> 13:57.400
Interesting place you have here.

13:57.402 --> 13:58.737
Are you sure the door was open?

13:59.771 --> 14:02.407
Yeah. Do you live alone?

14:08.546 --> 14:09.949
Why did you send me that stuff?

14:13.118 --> 14:14.319
Thought you might appreciate it.

14:18.223 --> 14:20.592
Fine. But why me?
Why not somebody else?

14:21.625 --> 14:23.027
Couple of reasons.

14:24.329 --> 14:25.464
I wanted to test them.

14:27.098 --> 14:29.265
And I wanted to test you.

14:29.267 --> 14:30.335
Why?

14:31.835 --> 14:33.305
Do you know
what you've been taking?

14:35.040 --> 14:36.738
Steroids.

14:36.740 --> 14:38.576
Well, I assume
they've been working for you.

14:40.045 --> 14:41.180
I think so.

14:42.247 --> 14:43.382
Good.

14:45.316 --> 14:49.117
Now, as I was saying,
I may have some work for you.

14:49.119 --> 14:51.422
- Work that should interest you.
- Who makes it?

14:53.457 --> 14:55.190
I do.

14:55.192 --> 14:57.059
What?

14:57.061 --> 14:59.163
I'm a scientist. Chemist.

15:00.598 --> 15:03.366
Don't worry.
I'm fully qualified.

15:03.368 --> 15:08.103
Look, this stuff's
giving me paranoia.

15:08.105 --> 15:09.441
I'm getting mood swings.

15:10.608 --> 15:11.674
I can't go on like that.

15:11.676 --> 15:13.575
I have a lot of clients
come to me

15:13.577 --> 15:18.381
with stories of counterfeit anabolic
steroids being sold to them,

15:18.383 --> 15:20.051
without the desired effects.

15:21.786 --> 15:24.356
Sometimes they have
no active ingredients at all.

15:25.757 --> 15:27.792
Sometimes they were meant
for animals.

15:29.127 --> 15:30.696
Didn't you say
you make these yourself?

15:32.363 --> 15:33.465
Yes.

15:38.603 --> 15:41.073
- Do you play?
- What?

15:44.676 --> 15:46.445
Do you have anything
for me or not?

16:09.533 --> 16:10.768
This should sort you out.

16:16.707 --> 16:18.776
It's just for show.
Don't worry.

16:23.781 --> 16:25.316
That's the best I've got.

16:26.683 --> 16:29.418
It's a combination
of Sustanon 250,

16:29.420 --> 16:31.623
Deca-Durabolin
and Stanozolol.

16:32.891 --> 16:34.860
You'll be able
to train much harder.

16:36.226 --> 16:38.928
It'll help you build up
your muscle mass,

16:38.930 --> 16:41.867
recover from any
strenuous exercise faster.

16:44.768 --> 16:46.270
That's as good as it gets.

16:49.374 --> 16:50.642
Right.

16:52.877 --> 16:54.378
Still interested?

16:56.748 --> 16:57.648
Yeah.

17:04.820 --> 17:06.358
Good.

17:11.994 --> 17:13.263
How much?

17:14.397 --> 17:15.566
Nothing.

17:16.701 --> 17:17.869
I can't accept this.

17:19.570 --> 17:20.872
Think of it as a trial.

17:23.339 --> 17:24.941
Give me a call.

17:24.943 --> 17:26.345
Let me know the results.

17:37.789 --> 17:39.258
I'll see myself out.

17:48.332 --> 17:49.700
[door opens]

17:50.767 --> 17:51.869
[door closes]

18:19.731 --> 18:21.300
[coughing]

18:37.615 --> 18:39.014
Are you okay?

18:39.016 --> 18:40.351
It's nothing.

18:44.022 --> 18:45.256
Let's toast.

18:46.957 --> 18:48.259
Another one.

18:49.726 --> 18:51.229
To the success
of new recruits.

18:52.429 --> 18:53.532
Yes.

19:01.004 --> 19:02.040
Prost.

20:37.702 --> 20:39.503
[breathes heavily]

21:24.482 --> 21:25.984
[keys jingling]

21:47.237 --> 21:48.639
[dialing]

21:50.741 --> 21:51.843
[line ringing]

21:53.543 --> 21:54.446
[phone rings]

21:55.480 --> 21:56.678
Yeah?

21:56.680 --> 21:59.482
[Stanley] Hey, Fader.
[indistinct]

21:59.484 --> 22:02.952
Listen, I can hardly hear you.
I'm underground.

22:02.954 --> 22:04.854
Can we continue
this conversation in person?

22:04.856 --> 22:06.588
[static]

22:06.590 --> 22:07.792
I'll send you the address.

22:09.494 --> 22:10.227
Bye for now.

22:13.563 --> 22:15.065
[rumbling]

22:41.725 --> 22:42.793
[Fader] Hello, Stan.

22:46.763 --> 22:47.666
Can I sit down?

22:48.666 --> 22:49.634
Please.

22:58.809 --> 22:59.778
Coffee?

23:00.811 --> 23:02.147
Looks like you could use one.

23:03.981 --> 23:05.183
No, thanks.

23:06.850 --> 23:08.954
- Just a glass of water.
- Water?

23:10.186 --> 23:11.121
Fine.

23:17.628 --> 23:18.797
I need another dose.

23:19.796 --> 23:20.965
Another one?

23:24.034 --> 23:25.536
I think
what you need is sleep.

23:26.603 --> 23:27.936
No.

23:27.938 --> 23:29.206
I need another...

23:47.123 --> 23:49.293
I won't give you anything else
for nothing, Stanley.

23:51.061 --> 23:54.096
Look at you.
You're exhausted.

23:54.098 --> 23:56.033
What you need
is a good night's sleep.

23:57.767 --> 24:00.301
You've been spending
too much time on your own.

24:00.303 --> 24:01.773
And at that gym.

24:06.776 --> 24:08.178
How much for some more?

24:11.648 --> 24:12.816
A lot.

24:16.987 --> 24:18.089
Looks like they're closing up.

24:19.223 --> 24:21.760
Don't worry.
I know the owner.

24:33.737 --> 24:37.007
If you can't afford it,
we can make a deal.

24:39.944 --> 24:42.113
I give you what you want...

24:45.750 --> 24:47.852
if you do something for me.

24:48.953 --> 24:50.155
What do you want me to do?

25:13.244 --> 25:15.714
You can have
whatever you want, Stanley.

25:17.747 --> 25:19.950
Just order whatever you want.

25:22.285 --> 25:23.621
I'll be in touch.

26:03.127 --> 26:04.696
[keys jingling]

26:30.387 --> 26:32.553
[Fader]
I give you what you want...

26:32.555 --> 26:34.458
if you do something for me.

26:53.910 --> 26:55.245
[phone rings]

27:10.494 --> 27:11.495
Good morning.

27:13.798 --> 27:14.866
You ready for that trade-off?

27:16.065 --> 27:17.401
- Yeah.
- Good.

27:18.435 --> 27:20.171
My employer
would like to meet you.

27:22.205 --> 27:24.775
He likes to be
introduced personally.

27:25.876 --> 27:26.978
What do you need me to do?

27:28.611 --> 27:30.348
I'll see you soon, Stanley.

27:31.549 --> 27:32.484
[phone hangs up]

28:36.513 --> 28:38.582
[bird squawks]

29:33.203 --> 29:34.606
[phone ringing]

29:41.445 --> 29:42.647
[Fader] I've spoken to him.

29:44.148 --> 29:45.646
He's on his way.

29:45.648 --> 29:47.452
Okay. I'll see you there.

29:50.987 --> 29:52.155
[door opens]

30:12.509 --> 30:13.945
How are you feeling?

30:17.147 --> 30:18.549
Not bad for a dying man.

30:39.069 --> 30:40.171
He'll be here soon.

30:41.437 --> 30:43.271
I can go down with you,
if you like.

30:43.273 --> 30:44.341
Not today.

31:35.091 --> 31:36.393
[ship horn blowing]

32:31.715 --> 32:33.415
Make that call now.

32:33.417 --> 32:34.648
Fine.

32:34.650 --> 32:37.418
I don't want any problems here
when he arrives.

32:37.420 --> 32:38.355
Sure.

32:39.423 --> 32:40.358
[phone line ringing]

32:41.425 --> 32:43.427
I'll be there. Okay.

33:06.782 --> 33:09.320
[indistinct announcement on PA]

33:51.360 --> 33:54.396
[Kaufman] So, tell me,
how did it go?

33:54.398 --> 33:55.797
It went well.

33:55.799 --> 33:56.868
As you predicted.

33:59.669 --> 34:01.770
Try not to be nervous.

34:01.772 --> 34:03.805
[Kaufman]
Was there much begging?

34:03.807 --> 34:04.742
[Jaeger] Too much.

34:05.742 --> 34:07.442
[Kaufman] Right.

34:07.444 --> 34:10.478
[Jaeger] We turned the whole
place over as you asked.

34:10.480 --> 34:13.348
Fader even got to test his
new serum with good results.

34:13.350 --> 34:15.817
So, despite the short planning,

34:15.819 --> 34:18.255
interrogations were rewarding.

34:20.690 --> 34:22.489
[Kaufman] And the documents?

34:22.491 --> 34:24.226
[Jaeger] She'll bring them.

34:24.228 --> 34:25.295
[Kaufman] Good.

34:27.897 --> 34:29.600
I just hope he's up to this...

34:31.802 --> 34:33.704
- This boy.
- If everything fails...

34:34.904 --> 34:36.907
I know I can rely on you.

34:38.542 --> 34:39.911
[Jaeger] I won't let it fail.

34:41.043 --> 34:43.344
I should get down
to the basement.

34:43.346 --> 34:45.514
- See where Fader's got to with the next shipment.
- [elevator dings]

34:50.753 --> 34:52.656
Haven't you got things
to get on with in the basement?

34:53.956 --> 34:55.359
Do you never shut up?

34:56.560 --> 34:58.326
Is he ready to see us?

34:58.328 --> 34:59.397
[the driver] Be patient, Fader.

35:00.464 --> 35:01.532
[Fader] I'm always patient.

35:02.699 --> 35:03.901
[the driver]
He's busy at the moment.

35:05.302 --> 35:07.636
[Fader] He might be
a while then.

35:07.638 --> 35:09.340
[the driver] Well, you
don't mind, do you, Fader?

35:10.373 --> 35:11.542
You're always patient.

35:17.313 --> 35:18.315
Get off me.

35:23.353 --> 35:24.488
What's all this?

35:29.393 --> 35:31.295
Just passing the time.

35:37.567 --> 35:38.735
Welcome.

36:09.498 --> 36:11.569
- I'm Kaufman.
- Stanley.

36:12.569 --> 36:13.670
Have a seat.

36:21.712 --> 36:24.581
I can't tell you more
than these two men can.

36:25.715 --> 36:27.451
But I wanted
to meet you anyway.

36:29.585 --> 36:30.788
I'll be going.

36:37.094 --> 36:40.561
Don't be offended by Jaeger.
He's always distant.

36:40.563 --> 36:42.029
He'll be watching out for you.

36:42.031 --> 36:43.998
He knows how things are run.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.936
- Is this your company?
- Hmm.

36:47.471 --> 36:49.003
Now tell me about yourself.

36:49.005 --> 36:51.105
- What would you like to know?
- Who you are.

36:51.107 --> 36:52.342
What has landed you here?

36:55.978 --> 36:58.616
Well, I agreed to help Fader
out, he's doing me a favor.

37:00.951 --> 37:02.753
Fader tells me
you're an avid boxer.

37:04.054 --> 37:05.920
Yeah, I enjoy it.

37:05.922 --> 37:08.056
I used to box a lot
when I was young.

37:08.058 --> 37:10.791
I always found it therapeutic.

37:10.793 --> 37:11.728
Yeah.

37:13.063 --> 37:15.563
Are your family happy
with your career?

37:15.565 --> 37:16.500
It's not a career.

37:17.500 --> 37:18.502
Not yet anyway.

37:19.569 --> 37:20.737
And I don't have a family.

37:23.507 --> 37:24.608
Not even parents?

37:25.708 --> 37:27.808
I was raised
in a children's home.

37:27.810 --> 37:28.912
An orphan.

37:30.147 --> 37:32.447
You never met your parents?

37:32.449 --> 37:36.750
Well, my file said that
my mother, a waitress,

37:36.752 --> 37:37.955
was murdered.

37:39.623 --> 37:41.221
I don't remember.

37:41.223 --> 37:41.991
I'm sorry.

37:44.094 --> 37:46.994
They never told you
what happened?

37:46.996 --> 37:49.933
Apparently, it was the manager of
the place where she was working.

37:51.034 --> 37:52.069
They didn't catch him.

37:53.969 --> 37:55.038
And your father?

37:56.139 --> 37:57.675
There's no record
of my father.

37:59.775 --> 38:01.775
Their relationship
can't have been serious,

38:01.777 --> 38:03.546
or else I'm sure he would've
dealt with that killer.

38:05.248 --> 38:06.516
Perhaps he did.

38:14.190 --> 38:16.791
I remember my father.

38:16.793 --> 38:19.096
A man harmed by the harshness
of his upbringing.

38:20.864 --> 38:22.032
I looked up to him.

38:23.567 --> 38:24.435
But I dealt with him.

38:25.469 --> 38:28.168
He gave me his gun
and I took it.

38:28.170 --> 38:29.737
The least I could do.

38:29.739 --> 38:31.409
One old man suffering,

38:32.476 --> 38:35.012
wasting away
in his ivory tower.

38:36.980 --> 38:38.616
Taught me everything I know.

38:42.152 --> 38:46.157
"A good scare is worth more
to a man than good advice."

38:57.167 --> 38:59.603
I shot him. And he fell.

39:01.270 --> 39:03.938
The toughest moment
of my file.

39:03.940 --> 39:05.505
He always said,

39:05.507 --> 39:10.947
"the greatest exercise for the heart
is to bend down and help another up."

39:16.987 --> 39:18.656
You are 25 years old?

39:19.788 --> 39:21.191
- Yeah.
- [knock on door]

39:37.107 --> 39:39.840
You should have a family
around you, Stan.

39:39.842 --> 39:41.212
Hard to miss
what you've never had.

39:43.813 --> 39:44.982
I understand.

39:46.815 --> 39:49.683
Well, Fader will tell you
what to do,

39:49.685 --> 39:50.888
if he hasn't done already.

39:51.855 --> 39:53.590
He's always very thorough.

39:56.326 --> 39:58.559
The clients
you would be dealing with

39:58.561 --> 40:00.830
are not
very good people, Stanley.

40:03.199 --> 40:04.802
They deserve
what's coming to them.

40:06.936 --> 40:09.203
Just do what you're asked.

40:09.205 --> 40:11.773
And don't stop
to feel sorry for them.

40:11.775 --> 40:12.843
Right.

40:19.281 --> 40:20.950
Good luck, Stanley.

40:31.962 --> 40:34.130
- [door opens]
- Let's take a walk.

40:35.998 --> 40:37.634
We have a lot
to go over before tonight.

40:38.668 --> 40:39.837
As I said before,

40:40.936 --> 40:43.036
you'll be doing very little.

40:43.038 --> 40:44.741
But I need you to stay sharp.

40:45.775 --> 40:48.241
I wanna know more
about this job.

40:48.243 --> 40:50.346
What does he mean, "Don't
stop to feel sorry for them"?

40:52.248 --> 40:55.753
What we do isn't always easy.

40:57.753 --> 40:58.855
Don't worry.

40:59.956 --> 41:01.659
You'll get used to it
soon enough.

41:03.993 --> 41:05.862
Come on, let's go.

41:24.047 --> 41:25.014
You ready?

41:37.293 --> 41:38.896
- [buzzer sounding]
- [the driver] Come.

41:55.277 --> 41:57.311
[Fader]
How's the questioning going?

41:57.313 --> 41:58.746
It's very tense in there.

41:58.748 --> 42:00.848
Jaeger would like
to see Stan now.

42:00.850 --> 42:02.382
He's gonna need you there
as well.

42:02.384 --> 42:03.353
[Fader] Fine.

42:05.087 --> 42:06.189
Here.

42:12.761 --> 42:13.863
Thanks.

42:19.368 --> 42:20.770
Why does Jaeger wanna see me?

42:22.105 --> 42:24.172
Probably just to brief you.

42:24.174 --> 42:25.242
I have been briefed.

42:32.014 --> 42:33.350
[Jaeger] So, you've been
briefed, have you?

42:39.822 --> 42:42.090
You better go
straight in then.

42:42.092 --> 42:46.326
Just remember
that nobody is innocent.

42:46.328 --> 42:48.364
And we all deserve
what's coming to us.

42:50.032 --> 42:51.402
After you, Stanley.

43:03.279 --> 43:04.715
[man sobs]

43:14.491 --> 43:16.960
You need to stop talking.

43:18.560 --> 43:20.063
[man] Why am I here?

43:21.864 --> 43:25.565
I want answers from you,
not questions.

43:25.567 --> 43:29.337
Don't test my patience.

43:29.339 --> 43:31.806
I don't have any answers!

43:31.808 --> 43:33.574
I was dragged into this mess.

43:33.576 --> 43:38.382
No, you thought you could use
people to your own ends.

43:40.049 --> 43:42.083
I haven't done anything.

43:42.085 --> 43:43.253
Just let me go!

43:45.788 --> 43:47.190
[exhales]

43:48.357 --> 43:49.392
You see that?

43:50.592 --> 43:53.261
That was not an answer.

43:53.263 --> 43:54.531
[man groans]

43:55.864 --> 43:57.297
[man] Please!

43:57.299 --> 43:58.968
[sobs]

44:01.571 --> 44:03.538
I don't know anything.

44:03.540 --> 44:07.978
You're going to drive me
to extreme measures.

44:14.116 --> 44:16.449
This is getting tiresome.

44:16.451 --> 44:17.553
Please.

44:19.022 --> 44:20.357
Please let me go.

44:21.623 --> 44:23.060
[Jaeger] Go where?

44:24.393 --> 44:25.928
I don't know.

44:27.429 --> 44:30.199
There is nowhere
for you to go.

44:36.839 --> 44:38.141
- [gun cocks]
- [man whimpers]

44:43.346 --> 44:44.882
[sobbing continues]

44:52.255 --> 44:54.224
Aren't you tired of running?

44:56.525 --> 44:57.426
[man] Please.

44:58.594 --> 45:00.163
- Let me go.
- What's wrong?

45:06.034 --> 45:07.103
I feel sick.

45:08.237 --> 45:09.339
I can't stay here.

45:11.440 --> 45:12.842
You haven't
even seen the finale.

45:20.350 --> 45:22.052
[man sobbing]

45:37.933 --> 45:39.002
Get him.

45:46.643 --> 45:49.478
Wait. Didn't you
make an agreement?

45:51.514 --> 45:52.916
[Stanley grunts]

46:30.386 --> 46:31.388
Hey!

46:36.292 --> 46:38.326
Is anyone there?

46:38.328 --> 46:39.529
Anyone!

46:47.103 --> 46:48.705
[breathes heavily]

47:45.795 --> 47:47.164
Let me go.

47:50.333 --> 47:53.768
This wasn't
what I agreed to. I...

47:53.770 --> 47:56.270
I don't understand what you
people think you're doing.

47:56.272 --> 47:57.741
We're giving you
an opportunity.

47:59.342 --> 48:01.074
To do what?

48:01.076 --> 48:02.279
To prove yourself.

48:03.779 --> 48:05.047
I don't understand.

48:06.748 --> 48:08.516
I'm an old man, Stanley.

48:08.518 --> 48:09.619
I don't have very long.

48:10.752 --> 48:12.288
And I want peace of mind.

48:13.522 --> 48:15.124
I have good people
working for me.

48:16.391 --> 48:18.224
But they are not like me.

48:18.226 --> 48:19.462
Where do I fit in?

48:21.431 --> 48:22.499
You're driven.

48:23.665 --> 48:26.132
You just need direction.

48:26.134 --> 48:28.471
Is this meant to be direction?

48:30.139 --> 48:34.111
"A good scare is worth more
to a man than good advice."

48:35.210 --> 48:36.145
I see.

48:40.282 --> 48:41.351
Do you?

48:46.422 --> 48:48.355
No.

48:48.357 --> 48:51.328
Well, a closed mind
is worth losing, Stanley.

48:53.529 --> 48:54.862
Just untie me.

48:54.864 --> 48:56.596
Why don't you just break free?

48:56.598 --> 48:59.766
Shut up and stop
playing these games.

48:59.768 --> 49:01.471
Why did you
leave the interrogation?

49:04.607 --> 49:05.609
It was disgusting.

49:06.708 --> 49:08.578
The first job
is always the hardest.

49:09.811 --> 49:12.279
Even when
you're just watching.

49:12.281 --> 49:14.418
"Power comes with a price."

49:15.518 --> 49:16.586
You will learn this.

49:17.652 --> 49:18.554
It's wrong.

49:21.623 --> 49:25.161
Why didn't you help the man
if it was so very wrong?

49:38.907 --> 49:40.176
[gun clatters]

49:53.922 --> 49:56.725
"The greatest exercise
for the heart

49:57.793 --> 50:00.363
to bend down
and help another up."

50:34.764 --> 50:35.765
You forgot your gun.

50:40.368 --> 50:41.871
It's not my gun anymore.

51:01.389 --> 51:02.725
[door opens]

51:04.427 --> 51:05.462
[door closes]

51:45.668 --> 51:47.204
[door opens]

52:11.460 --> 52:14.695
Can you just
let me out of here?

52:14.697 --> 52:19.065
I'm not sure you've upheld
your part of our agreement.

52:19.067 --> 52:21.534
All I agreed was to help you

52:21.536 --> 52:25.438
in return for something I didn't
even ask for in the first place.

52:25.440 --> 52:27.340
You came to me.

52:27.342 --> 52:28.377
Remember?

52:30.545 --> 52:33.713
I couldn't stomach
what you people do

52:33.715 --> 52:36.518
I just wanted to leave.
That was all.

52:43.993 --> 52:46.263
Give me those keys.

52:52.601 --> 52:54.467
You'll learn to stomach it.

52:54.469 --> 52:55.337
[keys jingling]

52:56.339 --> 52:57.340
Hey!

53:04.380 --> 53:05.515
[door locks]

53:48.424 --> 53:49.458
[gun clicks]

53:55.096 --> 53:57.697
[gunshots]

53:57.699 --> 53:58.734
[thud]

54:07.442 --> 54:08.477
What do you want from me?

54:25.560 --> 54:26.562
Pick it up.

54:53.489 --> 54:55.592
What are you waiting for?

55:02.964 --> 55:03.832
Do it.

55:05.034 --> 55:06.836
It's your only way out.

55:13.007 --> 55:14.143
[grunts]

55:45.975 --> 55:47.143
[exhales]

56:04.627 --> 56:05.795
[gunshot]

56:38.560 --> 56:39.928
You can take that
if you want to.

56:42.364 --> 56:43.600
He doesn't need it anymore.

57:03.786 --> 57:04.686
[sniffs]

57:17.165 --> 57:18.267
[panting]

57:53.168 --> 57:54.237
Well?

57:55.304 --> 57:57.137
He hit you, then ran.

57:57.139 --> 57:58.174
Did he see you move?

58:01.009 --> 58:02.210
[Fader] I think he bought it.

58:04.980 --> 58:06.648
[the driver] But he didn't
pass the test.

58:11.753 --> 58:14.253
He didn't pull the trigger.
He was too weak to act.

58:14.255 --> 58:16.088
He retaliated.

58:16.090 --> 58:17.259
That's what's important.

58:28.103 --> 58:30.737
None of us ever failed
the training games.

58:30.739 --> 58:32.938
I heard one of us did.

58:32.940 --> 58:33.942
Who?

58:36.712 --> 58:37.746
No one present.

58:47.889 --> 58:50.058
Today wasn't a failure.

58:51.125 --> 58:54.229
It just didn't go
exactly as planned.

58:57.232 --> 58:58.768
We need to find him.

59:30.431 --> 59:31.400
[grunts]

59:32.534 --> 59:34.500
He's locked it from inside.

59:34.502 --> 59:36.335
Then break it down.

59:36.337 --> 59:39.072
At least we gave him a scare.

59:39.074 --> 59:42.541
But he didn't snap like we predicted.
He was more controlled.

59:42.543 --> 59:44.379
Our work isn't finished.

59:45.413 --> 59:46.915
He'll try to leave the city.

59:50.451 --> 59:52.154
I want you to stop him.

59:55.991 --> 59:58.061
Do whatever it takes.

59:59.127 --> 01:00:00.062
[gun cocks]

01:00:04.199 --> 01:00:05.334
[gunshot]

01:00:37.866 --> 01:00:39.001
[Kaufman] You're driven.

01:00:41.969 --> 01:00:43.739
You just need direction.

01:01:00.121 --> 01:01:01.757
It's not my gun anymore.

01:01:37.292 --> 01:01:38.927
[panting]

01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:44.000
[dialing]

01:01:45.933 --> 01:01:47.002
[line ringing]

01:01:55.310 --> 01:01:57.110
[engaged tone]

01:01:57.112 --> 01:01:59.378
[automated voice] The number you
have dialed has not been recognized.

01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:01.114
Please check and try again.

01:02:01.116 --> 01:02:02.415
[engaged tone]

01:02:02.417 --> 01:02:05.217
The number you have dialed
has not been recognized.

01:02:05.219 --> 01:02:06.388
Please check and try...

01:03:10.752 --> 01:03:12.020
- [silenced gunshot]
- [grunts]

01:03:15.357 --> 01:03:16.625
[groans]

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:27.602
Let him go.

01:03:29.304 --> 01:03:30.606
He has no choice now.

01:06:01.389 --> 01:06:03.092
[siren wailing at a distance]

01:06:25.447 --> 01:06:28.313
We're running out of time.

01:06:28.315 --> 01:06:32.217
Stanley's initiation
hasn't gone according to plan.

01:06:32.219 --> 01:06:33.388
So now...

01:06:34.956 --> 01:06:36.292
it's your move.

01:06:37.592 --> 01:06:39.161
- No.
- Yes.

01:06:40.395 --> 01:06:42.898
Don't act like
you're not a part of this.

01:06:44.598 --> 01:06:46.266
We've hurt him enough.

01:06:46.268 --> 01:06:48.168
Stanley didn't choose this,
he just got reeled in.

01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:49.802
He took on a bait.

01:06:49.804 --> 01:06:51.639
And it served its purpose.

01:06:53.208 --> 01:06:55.641
But we don't have time
to allow Stanley

01:06:55.643 --> 01:06:57.879
to indulge his pipe dreams
any longer.

01:06:58.947 --> 01:07:01.183
We need to take
a different approach.

01:07:02.951 --> 01:07:04.717
I'm still surprised
he was so susceptible.

01:07:04.719 --> 01:07:09.688
His inexperience couldn't see
beyond his immediate needs.

01:07:09.690 --> 01:07:12.724
He didn't recognize that in
order to gain physical strength

01:07:12.726 --> 01:07:14.263
he needed mental discipline.

01:07:15.462 --> 01:07:17.532
That's why he believed
what Fader gave him.

01:07:20.368 --> 01:07:22.270
It's a shame we didn't
approach in another way.

01:07:24.206 --> 01:07:26.909
Kaufman wanted to see
how he'd react.

01:07:29.911 --> 01:07:32.612
I thought he would've pulled the
trigger on you after what happened.

01:07:32.614 --> 01:07:34.380
I hoped he would.

01:07:34.382 --> 01:07:37.253
Still, we can only
move forwards.

01:07:38.286 --> 01:07:39.321
Yes.

01:07:40.621 --> 01:07:42.424
I think he deserves
to choose for himself.

01:07:43.458 --> 01:07:46.425
Does he have a choice anymore?

01:07:46.427 --> 01:07:50.331
I think he'll realize that we're
pushing him down the right path.

01:07:52.634 --> 01:07:53.735
Is that what you want?

01:07:54.935 --> 01:07:56.804
I want what Kaufman wants.

01:07:58.772 --> 01:08:01.241
And if Stanley resists,
then what?

01:08:01.243 --> 01:08:02.478
He won't resist.

01:08:03.645 --> 01:08:05.378
I'm not convinced anymore.

01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:06.715
He has nowhere to go.

01:08:10.018 --> 01:08:11.753
[the girl] I don't want
to be a part of this.

01:08:14.022 --> 01:08:15.357
Not the way it's going.

01:08:20.261 --> 01:08:22.497
Sit down.

01:08:26.767 --> 01:08:27.734
Please.

01:08:42.683 --> 01:08:45.417
I can tell that you've begun
to care for Stanley

01:08:45.419 --> 01:08:47.221
or you wouldn't
have resurrections.

01:08:48.490 --> 01:08:50.390
But if you walk away now,

01:08:50.392 --> 01:08:52.895
the line ends with Kaufman.

01:08:57.631 --> 01:09:00.402
Don't you want
to see Stanley succeed?

01:09:04.438 --> 01:09:06.404
He'll need you.

01:09:06.407 --> 01:09:07.910
Like Kaufman has needed you.

01:09:10.645 --> 01:09:11.779
He's alone.

01:09:14.081 --> 01:09:15.747
Vulnerable.

01:09:15.749 --> 01:09:17.785
[the girl] And you're asking
me to take advantage of that?

01:09:21.721 --> 01:09:23.087
[exhales deeply]

01:09:23.090 --> 01:09:26.560
We can only guess
how much longer Kaufman has.

01:09:28.562 --> 01:09:30.665
We need to bring
Stanley in now.

01:09:32.499 --> 01:09:33.933
I can't promise that.

01:09:33.935 --> 01:09:35.536
But you can try.

01:09:38.505 --> 01:09:39.575
Don't give up now.

01:09:40.774 --> 01:09:42.544
Not when we've come this far.

01:09:46.013 --> 01:09:46.981
All right.

01:09:48.082 --> 01:09:49.680
But once I've done my part,

01:09:49.683 --> 01:09:52.051
you need to finish
what you started with him.

01:09:52.053 --> 01:09:53.589
That goes without saying.

01:10:01.629 --> 01:10:03.796
You and Kaufman
should speak again.

01:10:03.798 --> 01:10:05.834
After you've met with him.

01:10:11.405 --> 01:10:12.671
You haven't told him,
have you?

01:10:12.673 --> 01:10:13.841
That was never up to me.

01:10:17.379 --> 01:10:19.144
Has anyone told him?

01:10:19.146 --> 01:10:20.114
No.

01:10:21.615 --> 01:10:23.819
- He doesn't know.
- He needs to know now.

01:10:29.590 --> 01:10:30.625
[scoffs]

01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:34.863
- You want me to tell him.
- Exactly.

01:10:37.766 --> 01:10:39.634
It'll be best coming from you.

01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:38.060
[indistinct talking on TV]

01:12:10.924 --> 01:12:12.060
[breathes heavily]

01:13:09.651 --> 01:13:11.086
[footsteps approaching]

01:13:42.816 --> 01:13:43.985
Why are you here?

01:13:47.621 --> 01:13:48.757
I'm here to see you.

01:13:52.627 --> 01:13:54.025
Get out.

01:13:54.027 --> 01:13:55.731
Don't you want to know
why this is happening to you?

01:14:15.148 --> 01:14:16.151
What do you want?

01:14:17.884 --> 01:14:20.418
I want to talk to you.

01:14:20.420 --> 01:14:22.891
Look, I don't want anything
more to do with you people.

01:14:31.732 --> 01:14:34.634
I didn't even ask for those
in the first place.

01:14:34.636 --> 01:14:36.435
He just...

01:14:36.437 --> 01:14:39.274
told me to try them because he
knew I'd end up wanting more.

01:14:41.843 --> 01:14:43.111
They helped me to push myself.

01:14:48.215 --> 01:14:50.416
You may have been able
to push yourself,

01:14:50.418 --> 01:14:51.320
but it was just you.

01:14:55.322 --> 01:14:56.223
What?

01:14:57.290 --> 01:14:58.360
They weren't real.

01:15:03.263 --> 01:15:04.632
You just wanted them to be.

01:15:10.672 --> 01:15:11.772
What did he give me?

01:15:15.843 --> 01:15:16.945
The placebo.

01:15:28.822 --> 01:15:30.025
But they did help me.

01:15:34.262 --> 01:15:36.130
Only because you believed
they were something else.

01:15:38.865 --> 01:15:40.368
You have
unfinished business here.

01:15:45.039 --> 01:15:46.041
Why?

01:15:57.084 --> 01:15:58.386
We needed to draw you in.

01:16:02.322 --> 01:16:03.859
We have
a special interest in you.

01:16:07.027 --> 01:16:08.730
Is that why
you've been stalking me?

01:16:12.999 --> 01:16:14.368
I've just been
looking out for you.

01:16:24.846 --> 01:16:26.380
That gun isn't loaded,
you know.

01:16:38.825 --> 01:16:39.895
Check the chamber.

01:16:53.874 --> 01:16:54.909
It was a game.

01:17:14.161 --> 01:17:15.530
We needed to see
how you'd react.

01:17:28.008 --> 01:17:29.444
We have an important position
for you.

01:17:31.411 --> 01:17:32.414
[Kaufman] Good luck, Stanley.

01:17:35.215 --> 01:17:36.383
Let me help you.

01:17:41.454 --> 01:17:42.990
You have a legacy to succeed.

01:17:45.993 --> 01:17:47.462
There's no record
of my father.

01:17:50.330 --> 01:17:51.465
Kaufman.

01:18:20.093 --> 01:18:21.228
That was fast.

01:18:23.129 --> 01:18:24.932
Stanley didn't need
too much persuasion.

01:18:31.638 --> 01:18:33.440
Jaeger's plan worked then.

01:18:34.642 --> 01:18:36.044
I just drove them back.

01:18:37.143 --> 01:18:39.047
He won't trust us
for a while.

01:18:41.281 --> 01:18:42.284
She'll earn his trust.

01:18:43.683 --> 01:18:46.284
As Jaeger predicted.

01:18:46.286 --> 01:18:48.889
After all, I couldn't
keep him on the hook.

01:18:49.990 --> 01:18:51.225
He would've
caught on eventually.

01:18:52.259 --> 01:18:53.261
Sure.

01:18:56.931 --> 01:18:59.901
I had a good feeling about him
from the beginning.

01:19:02.136 --> 01:19:03.370
I hope you're right.

01:19:05.405 --> 01:19:07.007
Will he see Kaufman later?

01:19:09.009 --> 01:19:10.110
Depends how he feels.

01:19:11.178 --> 01:19:12.278
Stanley?

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:14.380
Kaufman.

01:19:14.382 --> 01:19:18.186
I expect he'll have
a lot of questions for him.

01:19:34.035 --> 01:19:35.103
Give me your hand.

01:19:40.441 --> 01:19:41.509
Give me your hand.

01:19:52.652 --> 01:19:54.052
Be careful.

01:19:54.054 --> 01:19:55.490
[elevator door opens]

01:20:19.213 --> 01:20:20.415
He's waiting for you.

01:20:41.468 --> 01:20:42.937
[gun clicks]

01:21:03.023 --> 01:21:04.092
Hello, Stanley.

01:21:06.093 --> 01:21:07.362
Why didn't you tell me before?

01:21:10.030 --> 01:21:11.231
Why all these games?

01:21:13.133 --> 01:21:15.203
I wanted to see
how you'd behave.

01:21:16.236 --> 01:21:17.504
Like a normal person.

01:21:23.276 --> 01:21:25.377
I tried to get out.

01:21:25.379 --> 01:21:26.381
So did I...

01:21:27.447 --> 01:21:28.516
At first.

01:21:31.252 --> 01:21:32.286
But I gave in.

01:21:34.155 --> 01:21:35.490
Like you have now.

01:21:36.690 --> 01:21:38.460
I haven't
given in to anything.

01:21:41.795 --> 01:21:43.330
You're like me, Stanley.

01:21:44.432 --> 01:21:45.600
I'm nothing like you.

01:21:50.404 --> 01:21:52.072
Then why are you here?

01:21:55.209 --> 01:21:56.244
You know why.

01:21:57.311 --> 01:21:58.413
You're mine.

01:22:05.652 --> 01:22:08.022
I don't believe you.

01:22:11.691 --> 01:22:13.725
Why have you done this?

01:22:13.727 --> 01:22:15.263
Why all these games?

01:22:17.464 --> 01:22:22.503
"A good scare is worth more
to a man than good advice."

01:22:25.772 --> 01:22:26.775
A good scare.

01:22:36.683 --> 01:22:37.851
I've got one for you.

01:22:39.553 --> 01:22:41.552
It's all yours, son.

01:22:41.554 --> 01:22:42.757
I'm not your son.

01:22:46.927 --> 01:22:48.362
I'm nothing like you.

01:22:53.667 --> 01:22:55.070
[gunshot]

01:23:33.606 --> 01:23:36.507
[Stanley] The mind games we play
with those we are closest to

01:23:36.509 --> 01:23:39.610
are often so subtly
enacted in daily life

01:23:39.612 --> 01:23:42.383
that we are not even
aware of them.

01:24:06.539 --> 01:24:09.743
It could be compared to the inevitability
of fate creeping up on you.

01:24:18.218 --> 01:24:21.722
I'm sure people become less and
less aware of this manipulation.

01:24:26.660 --> 01:24:29.764
Ignorance of the causes
and effects of their actions.

01:24:37.771 --> 01:24:40.575
People control people.

01:24:44.978 --> 01:24:46.446
[elevator door opens]

01:24:49.016 --> 01:24:50.652
[siren wailing at a distance]

01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:55.455
They thought
they were helping me.

01:25:05.298 --> 01:25:06.734
I've won more than I've lost.

01:25:10.603 --> 01:25:12.773
"All power comes at a price."

01:25:35.762 --> 01:25:36.763
It's ended.
