00:31.874 --> 00:33.073
About six months ago,

00:33.125 --> 00:34.491
I was approached by the
intelligence department

00:34.544 --> 00:36.627
of the Casa de Contratación.

00:36.662 --> 00:39.330
They offered me a
significant amount of money.

00:39.382 --> 00:40.714
I said yes.

00:40.883 --> 00:42.917
The department's spies
had learned of an attempt

00:42.969 --> 00:45.419
to walk away with their money
without them knowing of it.

00:45.421 --> 00:48.639
If you do not return the
entirety of the hidden cache,

00:48.674 --> 00:50.507
know that Nassau will
likely burn for it.

00:50.560 --> 00:52.309
With everything I've
lost in recent days,

00:52.345 --> 00:54.144
I can't afford to lose the name, too.

00:54.180 --> 00:55.846
We walk into the tavern,
we sign our names,

00:55.898 --> 00:58.732
and then not only are we square
with the law our money is, too.

00:58.768 --> 01:01.235
The wound should be far further
along towards quietening itself.

01:01.270 --> 01:02.770
If the decay progresses,

01:02.822 --> 01:04.405
I'll have to remove more of your leg.

01:04.440 --> 01:05.773
What does a colonial power do

01:05.825 --> 01:07.942
when they see a sitting governor

01:07.944 --> 01:12.780
deposed by an alliance of pirates
and slaves bring down Nassau?

01:14.367 --> 01:15.499
Maybe bring it all down.

01:15.534 --> 01:16.834
What happens now?

01:16.869 --> 01:18.552
Now we go find Charles Vane.

03:50.272 --> 03:51.739
Where is he?

04:22.354 --> 04:24.354
When you said that
you'd be staying behind

04:24.390 --> 04:26.440
to solidify our new compact,

04:26.475 --> 04:28.308
I assumed that meant something.

04:28.310 --> 04:30.394
For you to be seen as uninterested

04:30.446 --> 04:32.362
in what is happening for my father now,

04:32.398 --> 04:34.448
that is not going to
help convince anyone here

04:34.483 --> 04:36.950
that you are serious about
desiring their friendship.

04:44.827 --> 04:46.794
It'll pass.

04:48.164 --> 04:51.081
It's just a fever from the wound.

04:54.553 --> 04:56.253
I'm fine.

05:20.779 --> 05:22.446
Christ!

05:25.918 --> 05:27.701
I'm all right!

05:27.753 --> 05:30.454
Swing it down on deck!

05:30.506 --> 05:31.705
Fucking idiot!

05:31.757 --> 05:33.874
Listen, if you can't tie a rope,
you shouldn't be on this ship!

05:33.876 --> 05:35.709
Get astern. Calm down!

05:35.711 --> 05:37.377
Hey! What's going on here?

05:39.715 --> 05:41.265
His lashing came undone.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.600
I fucking showed it
to him 10 minutes ago.

05:43.636 --> 05:45.052
Someone could have been killed.

05:47.106 --> 05:48.972
Then you showed him incorrectly.

05:50.609 --> 05:53.560
It's a fucking lashing.
I know how to tie it.

05:53.562 --> 05:56.947
If he tied it wrong, then
you instructed him wrong.

06:01.120 --> 06:03.120
You listen to me.

06:03.155 --> 06:06.623
We persuaded them that they need us.

06:06.659 --> 06:08.075
We most certainly need them.

06:08.127 --> 06:10.911
Do you understand what I'm saying?

06:24.510 --> 06:27.010
Don't imagine that will
be the last of those.

06:29.072 --> 06:30.300
Neither do I.

06:32.434 --> 06:34.601
So how exactly do you see this working?

06:35.934 --> 06:37.926
They have their orders.

06:39.015 --> 06:41.275
As long as we hold
our end of the bargain,

06:41.327 --> 06:41.842
they'll hold.

06:42.124 --> 06:44.444
Yeah, that wasn't what I meant.

06:45.281 --> 06:47.581
I understood a war meant
to antagonize England

06:47.616 --> 06:48.582
to frighten them,

06:48.617 --> 06:52.586
to prevent them from
moving against Nassau.

06:52.621 --> 06:55.589
But that isn't what we're
talking about anymore, is it?

06:55.624 --> 06:57.958
Now you're talking about
a war meant to be won.

06:59.962 --> 07:02.596
You convinced them.

07:02.631 --> 07:05.766
Convinced Scott, his wife, their people,

07:05.801 --> 07:09.303
our people, even Silver.

07:09.305 --> 07:11.021
But not you.

07:12.558 --> 07:15.108
Everyone's wrong but you.

07:18.030 --> 07:20.113
Maybe.

07:20.149 --> 07:23.066
Captain! Masts!

07:32.828 --> 07:33.994
Captain.

07:37.883 --> 07:42.586
Ocracoke Island. Teach is there.

07:42.638 --> 07:46.089
A few hours' time, assuming he's there,

07:46.141 --> 07:47.507
I'm going to begin a discussion

07:47.559 --> 07:49.009
in which I'm going to
ask him for something

07:49.061 --> 07:51.928
that he can't possibly give.

07:51.981 --> 07:53.981
And the success or failure of this war

07:54.016 --> 07:56.016
will depend upon the outcome.

07:57.936 --> 07:59.403
In a few hours' time,

07:59.438 --> 08:02.072
there's a good chance you're
going to look awfully smart.

08:18.090 --> 08:19.790
What are you doing?

08:21.377 --> 08:23.010
Bring him down!

08:42.898 --> 08:44.147
You look good.

08:44.198 --> 08:46.066
As handsome as ever.

08:46.068 --> 08:48.402
You always were a gifted liar.

08:51.073 --> 08:53.623
When you were still pirating,

08:53.659 --> 08:56.209
I was the woman who
was Blackbeard's woman.

08:56.245 --> 08:59.629
Put my services in great demand

08:59.665 --> 09:03.467
all men wanting what
notorious men already had.

09:05.921 --> 09:07.337
And then you leave

09:07.389 --> 09:09.756
and my business fades.

09:11.727 --> 09:13.894
It's always the little
people who get hurt the worst

09:13.929 --> 09:15.595
when the market turns.

09:23.822 --> 09:26.940
So when are you going to tell me?

09:26.992 --> 09:28.108
Tell you what?

09:28.110 --> 09:30.160
What he's doing here.

09:31.196 --> 09:32.612
Charles?

09:36.201 --> 09:39.503
I remember when he had
forced you from Nassau.

09:39.538 --> 09:41.204
I remember how angry you were,

09:41.256 --> 09:43.290
how disappointed.

09:43.342 --> 09:44.541
And I remember you telling me

09:44.593 --> 09:46.209
that you'd never make
the same mistake again,

09:46.261 --> 09:49.045
that you had learned the hard way

09:49.098 --> 09:51.214
that only God made sons.

09:52.101 --> 09:53.633
Things are different now.

09:53.685 --> 09:55.719
Different how?

09:55.771 --> 09:57.771
Doesn't need to last long.

10:05.814 --> 10:08.615
A little Spanish shrapnel.

10:08.650 --> 10:12.319
It went in here when I was
not much older than him.

10:12.321 --> 10:16.323
Once in a while it migrates,

10:16.325 --> 10:20.243
ticks closer to reaching its terminus

10:20.295 --> 10:23.213
and striking its chime.

10:23.248 --> 10:26.383
Grim little timepiece

10:26.418 --> 10:30.170
whose ticking has grown
louder to my ears of late.

10:32.641 --> 10:34.758
Charles doesn't know, does he?

10:38.063 --> 10:39.346
Captain!

10:58.000 --> 10:59.416
Jesus.

11:04.339 --> 11:05.789
Welcome to Ocracoke.

11:13.382 --> 11:15.549
At first I was tempted,

11:15.551 --> 11:18.301
but in the end it felt wrong

11:18.353 --> 11:20.554
to betray the governor that way.

11:22.357 --> 11:24.524
And it felt dangerous...

11:26.028 --> 11:27.644
so I declined.

11:28.447 --> 11:30.113
Then how did this happen?

11:31.233 --> 11:33.116
How does an honest chambermaid

11:33.151 --> 11:34.784
end up in the employ
of the Spanish empire?

11:42.411 --> 11:45.045
A few days after I
declined their offer...

11:48.800 --> 11:51.084
I came home late from
the governor's service.

11:53.839 --> 11:56.756
It wasn't unusual for me to return home

11:56.758 --> 12:00.727
to find my children
long since fast asleep.

12:00.762 --> 12:04.564
That night, my children were not alone.

12:04.600 --> 12:08.235
The man who had approached me

12:08.270 --> 12:11.354
Grandal... was there...

12:12.107 --> 12:13.907
waiting.

12:15.827 --> 12:17.277
In his left hand, a knife.

12:17.329 --> 12:19.579
In his right, a purse.

12:23.001 --> 12:26.836
He said my children would receive
something from him that night.

12:28.924 --> 12:31.758
He asked me to choose which.

12:35.097 --> 12:37.631
These are the people
whom I am beholden to.

12:37.683 --> 12:40.934
This is what they are capable of doing.

12:42.938 --> 12:44.771
I cannot imagine what they will do

12:44.806 --> 12:47.057
if the cache is not returned whole.

12:58.320 --> 12:59.653
Ship's manifest, sir.

12:59.655 --> 13:00.987
The entirety of the gold from the fort

13:00.989 --> 13:02.989
is now stowed and ready
for transport to Havana.

13:02.991 --> 13:05.158
We should be under way within the hour.

13:05.210 --> 13:06.826
Put it in my office, please.

13:13.001 --> 13:14.634
I just left Miss Hudson.

13:17.306 --> 13:19.839
I had the instinct once or twice,

13:19.841 --> 13:22.509
the way she'd been watching me of late.

13:22.511 --> 13:24.394
I dismissed it,

13:24.429 --> 13:25.895
just assumed it related to some concern

13:25.931 --> 13:29.015
over my relationship with you
and its becoming inappropriate.

13:31.603 --> 13:33.019
What did she say?

13:34.239 --> 13:36.022
Did she report that
we're earnestly attempting

13:36.024 --> 13:37.273
to find and return the missing money?

13:37.326 --> 13:40.660
It's not about the money
for them, not anymore.

13:40.696 --> 13:43.913
When the gold from the Urca
was stolen, it was bad enough.

13:43.949 --> 13:45.832
Now they hear the
gold is being converted

13:45.867 --> 13:47.834
into something more
easily hidden from them,

13:47.869 --> 13:50.286
more easily smuggled away.

13:50.339 --> 13:54.090
That isn't theft. It's an insult.

13:54.126 --> 13:57.127
And insults to empires require answers.

14:00.432 --> 14:02.465
So it's personal, then?

14:04.386 --> 14:07.887
A binary question of my trustworthiness.

14:07.889 --> 14:12.108
Either I return the full
cache and prove it or I fail,

14:12.144 --> 14:14.861
and in trying to excuse the shortfall,

14:14.896 --> 14:16.312
only aggravate their existing suspicion

14:16.365 --> 14:19.866
that I am part of the pirate
problem, not its solution.

14:19.901 --> 14:22.869
And the dread fleet in Havana
sets sail the very next day

14:22.904 --> 14:25.155
to raze all of Nassau to the ground.

14:25.207 --> 14:29.159
Then we'll fight them,
defend the island.

14:29.211 --> 14:31.461
The odds would be dire, but
we are not without resources.

14:31.496 --> 14:32.829
No, not "we."

14:32.881 --> 14:34.831
I mean, someone might fight
them, but it won't be you and I.

14:34.883 --> 14:36.750
If the result of my endeavor here

14:36.802 --> 14:39.135
is a Spanish attack
against British forces,

14:39.171 --> 14:41.921
an act that threatens to
drag the empire into a war,

14:41.973 --> 14:44.591
I would be recalled to London
and likely debtors' prison

14:44.643 --> 14:47.260
and your capital sentence
would be reinstated.

14:47.262 --> 14:50.930
Now, I believe Nassau's best chance
at survival is with me guiding it.

14:50.932 --> 14:53.933
But if we cannot find Jack
Rackham and Anne Bonny,

14:53.935 --> 14:56.152
if we can't find the
cache in their possession,

14:56.188 --> 14:59.739
whatever happens to Nassau,
you and I are likely finished.

15:18.043 --> 15:19.626
Pardon me, gentlemen, if
you don't mind me asking,

15:19.678 --> 15:21.511
where is this wagon headed?

15:21.546 --> 15:24.464
To the fort.

15:24.516 --> 15:26.049
To do what, exactly?

15:26.101 --> 15:27.717
To fix it.

15:30.439 --> 15:32.138
I see.

15:33.809 --> 15:35.642
Just you two on the job, is it?

15:35.644 --> 15:37.310
A whole gang of us up there.

15:37.362 --> 15:39.696
Governor wants it shipshape
by the end of the month.

15:43.318 --> 15:45.985
Suppose that fort's not
going to rebuild itself.

15:50.876 --> 15:54.244
No, I suppose it won't.

16:04.005 --> 16:06.673
Hold still.

16:08.510 --> 16:10.009
There.

16:11.179 --> 16:13.730
Well? What do you think?

16:13.765 --> 16:16.933
You mean aside from the tit curtains?

16:16.985 --> 16:19.402
It's called a cravat.

16:20.856 --> 16:21.493
You want to fit in with them, right?

16:21.629 --> 16:24.824
- This is what they wear.
- "They" who?

16:24.860 --> 16:27.277
Respectable men.

16:30.699 --> 16:32.165
All right, yeah.

16:35.036 --> 16:36.870
Place of birth?

16:36.922 --> 16:38.037
Bristol.

16:38.089 --> 16:39.622
Occupation?

16:40.122 --> 16:41.250
Ship's carpenter.

16:42.377 --> 16:46.129
- Ship served?
- I used to serve the Buccaneer.

16:46.181 --> 16:47.597
Sign here.

16:49.718 --> 16:52.552
Move on. Next?

16:52.604 --> 16:54.721
What the fuck are you doing here?

16:56.691 --> 16:58.641
It's a cravat.

16:58.693 --> 17:00.059
It's what respectable men wear.

17:00.111 --> 17:02.605
It's... never mind what it is.

17:03.100 --> 17:03.972
You're supposed to be long gone by now.

17:04.530 --> 17:05.165
Why'd you come back?

17:05.567 --> 17:06.566
Where we're going,

17:06.617 --> 17:09.021
it seemed better to have
one of these than not.

17:09.288 --> 17:10.375
I thought as an added prize,

17:10.705 --> 17:12.571
I'd at least be able
to see it for myself,

17:12.624 --> 17:14.240
the new governor up to his ears

17:14.291 --> 17:16.041
in the very same bullshit
in which I've been drowning

17:16.077 --> 17:17.743
for the past few months.
And what do I find?

17:17.746 --> 17:19.579
The streets are swept,

17:19.580 --> 17:21.214
industry is in fashion,

17:21.249 --> 17:23.049
you're dressed like a Turkish whore,

17:23.084 --> 17:24.500
and all because a man arrived,

17:24.553 --> 17:28.054
stood on the beach, and said please.

17:28.089 --> 17:30.506
- You're angry.
- I'm confounded.

17:30.559 --> 17:32.842
He offers them less in
wages than I offered,

17:32.894 --> 17:34.260
demands more from them in labor,

17:34.312 --> 17:35.979
restricts more from them in license,

17:36.014 --> 17:39.599
and yet despite all of that,

17:39.651 --> 17:41.935
he's won them.

17:41.937 --> 17:44.153
How can that be?

17:44.189 --> 17:45.688
I know it may be hard to believe

17:45.740 --> 17:48.074
given my appearance at the moment,

17:48.109 --> 17:50.944
but the experience of it?

17:50.996 --> 17:53.279
It ain't half bad, Jack.

17:53.331 --> 17:54.497
Next.

17:56.117 --> 17:58.451
Next man, please.

17:59.588 --> 18:00.620
Your legal name?

18:00.622 --> 18:02.455
John Rackham.

18:07.545 --> 18:08.711
What?

18:17.188 --> 18:19.305
The Lord Governor would
like a word with you.

18:28.483 --> 18:29.949
Watch him, please.

18:29.985 --> 18:31.484
I'll go fetch Fremah to tend to him.

18:31.536 --> 18:32.485
I said no.

18:32.537 --> 18:35.405
- I know you did.
- I don't want help.

18:48.503 --> 18:50.136
It'll pass.

18:50.171 --> 18:53.006
I'll just find a place to
weather it for the night.

18:53.008 --> 18:57.977
I understand that you do not
want anyone to see you this way.

18:58.013 --> 18:59.228
What I don't understand

18:59.264 --> 19:01.397
is why you choose to
suffer in the first place.

19:01.433 --> 19:03.349
You must have access to
better medicines than that.

19:03.351 --> 19:05.435
We've got access to
better medicines than that.

19:05.487 --> 19:07.103
This has nothing to do with medicine.

19:07.155 --> 19:08.571
It has something to do with medicine...

19:08.606 --> 19:11.524
I cannot look weak.

19:11.576 --> 19:15.028
I cannot feel weak. I cannot be weak.

19:15.030 --> 19:17.613
Not in front of my men.
Not in front of your men.

19:17.666 --> 19:19.866
Not at all.

19:19.868 --> 19:21.367
For some time now, I have been holding

19:21.369 --> 19:23.753
my entire world
together with both hands,

19:23.788 --> 19:27.423
keeping my men in line,
seeing to their needs,

19:27.459 --> 19:32.178
and the only way that
endures is if I look the part.

19:32.213 --> 19:34.597
And I cannot look the part
while being poked and prodded

19:34.632 --> 19:36.432
or while drooling through an opium haze

19:36.468 --> 19:38.551
saying who the fuck knows what.

19:40.021 --> 19:41.971
So I will endure this

19:42.023 --> 19:44.974
the way I have been enduring it.

19:49.981 --> 19:53.449
No one prepared you for this, did they?

19:56.204 --> 19:58.121
For as long as I can remember,

19:58.156 --> 20:00.406
I have been prepared for the day

20:00.458 --> 20:03.292
I would take my mother's place.

20:03.328 --> 20:06.462
To know that from that day forth,

20:06.498 --> 20:09.248
I would forever be the one who tends

20:09.250 --> 20:11.634
as opposed to the one who is tended to.

20:13.054 --> 20:16.005
You're frustrated. You're angry.

20:16.057 --> 20:18.391
You're tired.

20:18.426 --> 20:20.676
Perhaps no one else knows why.

20:20.729 --> 20:23.312
I believe that not even you know why.

20:24.733 --> 20:26.516
But I know why.

20:32.490 --> 20:35.658
The crown is always a burden...

20:38.246 --> 20:42.749
but it cannot be borne
if you cannot stand.

20:52.293 --> 20:54.427
Nearly dismasted in a storm...

20:54.462 --> 20:56.512
a storm you chased after.

20:56.548 --> 20:59.182
Nearly starved to death in the doldrums.

20:59.217 --> 21:00.550
Nearly executed by them.

21:02.470 --> 21:05.555
Either you are unkillable, friend,

21:05.607 --> 21:07.690
or way overdue.

21:09.444 --> 21:12.562
One way or another, I am here,

21:12.614 --> 21:16.732
and there is much to discuss
about all our futures.

21:16.785 --> 21:20.820
What kind of future do
you propose that to be?

21:20.822 --> 21:25.541
I intend to gather forces
and move to reclaim Nassau.

21:25.577 --> 21:27.160
The conquest is always weakest

21:27.162 --> 21:30.496
when the conqueror allows himself
to believe that it is done.

21:30.498 --> 21:33.082
For Nassau, that point is now.

21:34.135 --> 21:35.585
Now, England may hold the island,

21:35.637 --> 21:37.503
but it still needs supplies brought in.

21:37.555 --> 21:40.556
It is still dependent upon trade.

21:40.592 --> 21:42.892
We will make that impossible for him.

21:42.927 --> 21:45.728
We will harass his ships.
We will plunder his supplies.

21:45.763 --> 21:49.148
We will force him to
bleed capital and support

21:49.184 --> 21:50.650
and the goodwill of
the men surrounding him

21:50.685 --> 21:53.019
until he is weak enough
to challenge directly.

21:53.071 --> 21:55.822
Until we can bring the fleet to bear

21:55.857 --> 21:57.523
and retake the bay.

21:58.660 --> 22:00.026
You know, when I called Nassau home,

22:00.028 --> 22:02.578
most of the men on this
beach weren't even men.

22:02.614 --> 22:04.780
I sailed with Ben Hornigold.

22:04.833 --> 22:07.700
I sailed with Sam Bellamy.
I sailed with Henry Avery.

22:07.752 --> 22:11.537
Feuded with them, stole from them,

22:11.539 --> 22:14.173
questioned their motives,

22:14.209 --> 22:17.543
but we all knew what we were.

22:17.595 --> 22:19.962
Then a man arrives
who would explain to us

22:20.014 --> 22:22.515
that what we've been doing
was wrong all those years,

22:22.550 --> 22:26.719
what Nassau ought to
be, what he could make it

22:26.771 --> 22:30.389
if we would all just follow his lead.

22:30.391 --> 22:34.977
And here you are again to do the same.

22:35.029 --> 22:39.198
You let it go well before its time.

22:39.234 --> 22:42.652
It was past its time.

22:42.704 --> 22:46.656
That you cannot see this
only makes it clearer to me

22:46.708 --> 22:50.910
that you never even knew
it in the first place.

22:50.962 --> 22:54.714
This fleet is all that remains of it,

22:54.749 --> 22:57.717
and as long as it's mine,
Nassau shall remain in its past.

22:57.752 --> 22:59.085
It isn't yours.

22:59.137 --> 23:01.587
It never was.

23:01.639 --> 23:05.258
Those ships, their commanders and crews,

23:05.260 --> 23:09.178
they were pledged to
my command, not yours.

23:09.230 --> 23:11.731
Oaths were taken,

23:11.766 --> 23:14.433
and I have come to see them honored.

23:14.435 --> 23:17.937
Do you honestly believe
that I would just step aside

23:17.989 --> 23:19.238
and let you make that claim?

23:19.274 --> 23:23.609
I honestly don't give a shit
what you would or would not do.

23:25.079 --> 23:26.996
The decision isn't yours.

23:27.031 --> 23:29.332
It's his.

23:34.839 --> 23:37.757
I've come to resume our compact,

23:37.792 --> 23:40.710
the one we swore upon
our lives to uphold.

23:40.762 --> 23:43.346
If you stand up and acknowledge it,

23:43.381 --> 23:44.764
this fleet will follow us.

23:44.799 --> 23:45.932
I'm certain of it.

23:47.635 --> 23:49.100
- You weren't there.
- No, I wasn't.

23:50.871 --> 23:51.551
But had I been there,

23:51.866 --> 23:53.866
there would be no
question about any of this.

23:55.175 --> 23:57.047
Had I been there, we would have mounted

23:57.391 --> 23:58.903
the defense that we had agreed to mount.

23:59.274 --> 24:01.292
Had you been there, you
would have seen their faces,

24:01.950 --> 24:03.449
the ones who laid their arms down

24:03.484 --> 24:05.151
and turned their backs on us.

24:05.203 --> 24:07.987
The ones who took our money for months

24:07.989 --> 24:10.489
and were happy to try and
deliver my head to our enemies

24:10.491 --> 24:12.041
for a little more of it.

24:13.378 --> 24:15.461
Nassau is dead.

24:15.496 --> 24:17.463
It doesn't deserve anything else from me

24:17.498 --> 24:19.632
or the men on this beach.

24:19.667 --> 24:22.001
We are finally free from it,

24:22.053 --> 24:24.503
and I see no reason to change that.

24:30.178 --> 24:33.346
If you wish to leave
this place, I'll allow it,

24:35.650 --> 24:40.319
although somehow I don't think
you have any intention of leaving.

24:41.439 --> 24:43.022
No, I don't.

24:43.074 --> 24:45.408
And I think you know that
I would never allow you

24:45.443 --> 24:46.859
to call a vote to settle the matter

24:46.861 --> 24:50.529
of who this fleet follows and
risk you depleting my force

24:50.531 --> 24:54.867
by luring away some misguided minority.

24:54.869 --> 24:57.336
No, I don't imagine you would.

24:57.372 --> 25:00.873
So we have one fleet
and two men claiming it.

25:03.344 --> 25:07.596
There is only one way I
know of to resolve that.

25:10.435 --> 25:13.602
Pistols, then swords.

25:25.199 --> 25:27.400
Captain Rackham.

25:27.402 --> 25:28.734
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

25:28.786 --> 25:31.070
Give us the room, please.

25:31.122 --> 25:33.406
Drink?

25:33.458 --> 25:35.908
Thank you.

25:35.910 --> 25:38.294
I apologize for the
strangeness of this meeting.

25:38.329 --> 25:40.246
I know you and I don't know each other.

25:41.582 --> 25:45.334
I know you... some.

25:45.386 --> 25:46.752
I read your book.

25:48.423 --> 25:49.922
Did you?

25:49.924 --> 25:51.307
Well, most of it.

25:51.342 --> 25:52.925
I confess, I may not quite have

25:52.977 --> 25:54.009
soldiered through to the end.

25:54.062 --> 25:56.595
But, you know, I got the gist of it.

26:00.485 --> 26:01.600
If you don't mind my asking,

26:01.602 --> 26:04.403
what did you take to be its gist?

26:04.439 --> 26:07.440
Wealthy son of a wealthy
man takes to the sea

26:07.442 --> 26:11.610
to prove something to
the parents, presumably.

26:11.662 --> 26:15.614
Seeks adventure, finds the
limits of his own capacity.

26:15.666 --> 26:17.583
Loses everything in the process

26:17.618 --> 26:21.754
and then stumbles upon a hell
of a story in the process.

26:21.789 --> 26:25.091
Please understand, I'm quite
particular about my library,

26:25.126 --> 26:28.127
but people seem to have liked it fine,

26:28.129 --> 26:30.429
and it seems to have
done wonders for you.

26:30.465 --> 26:33.682
So congratulations on all that.

26:38.189 --> 26:39.522
Thank you.

26:41.976 --> 26:44.810
All of that notwithstanding...

26:46.280 --> 26:49.982
you and I share an
experience in this place.

26:49.984 --> 26:52.818
And as such, I'm hopeful
that you'll understand

26:52.870 --> 26:54.954
why it is I brought you here today

26:54.989 --> 26:57.156
and what it is I'm about to ask of you.

26:58.993 --> 27:00.126
What's that?

27:02.046 --> 27:05.498
I know you removed a significant
amount of gold from the fort.

27:05.500 --> 27:07.550
I know it is in your possession,

27:07.585 --> 27:09.048
and I need you to give it up...

27:11.152 --> 27:12.631
or we're all dead.

27:32.693 --> 27:34.994
You can't win.

27:36.614 --> 27:38.914
I hear you spent weeks becalmed,

27:38.950 --> 27:40.366
deprived of food and water.

27:40.368 --> 27:42.751
At your best, it would
have been a dogfight,

27:42.787 --> 27:45.921
but diminished...

27:45.957 --> 27:47.923
I'm not that diminished.

27:51.128 --> 27:53.596
He's been off the account for years.

27:53.631 --> 27:56.765
He'll be more vulnerable than
he remembers himself being.

27:56.801 --> 27:58.767
He's not that vulnerable.

28:00.354 --> 28:01.770
And for what?

28:01.806 --> 28:03.606
You subject yourself to certain death

28:03.641 --> 28:05.724
for an island full of
weaklings and ingrates?

28:05.726 --> 28:08.611
Those men will go where they are led.

28:10.982 --> 28:13.115
Rogers captured their
minds before you could,

28:13.150 --> 28:16.285
but let's not pretend that
they can't be won again.

28:16.320 --> 28:18.787
And let's not pretend that
either of us believes for a moment

28:18.823 --> 28:20.789
that I'm doing this for their sakes.

28:20.825 --> 28:24.410
I gave you my word.

28:24.412 --> 28:26.378
Shook your hand.

28:26.414 --> 28:29.381
Pledged to defend the island with you.

28:29.417 --> 28:33.085
But my pledge to him began a long
time before I ever knew your name.

28:33.087 --> 28:35.971
- What I owe him...
- I don't care.

28:37.725 --> 28:39.758
I don't care that you shook my hand.

28:39.760 --> 28:42.228
I don't care what you feel you owe him.

28:42.263 --> 28:46.181
This is too important to
be clouded by any of that.

28:46.234 --> 28:48.934
They took my home.

28:50.738 --> 28:52.688
I can't walk away from that.

28:53.774 --> 28:55.324
Can you?

28:57.361 --> 29:00.579
Forget me, forget Teach, forget loyalty,

29:00.615 --> 29:03.749
compacts, honor, debts, all of it.

29:03.784 --> 29:06.368
The only question that matters is this.

29:08.789 --> 29:10.289
Who are you?

29:19.767 --> 29:23.636
Spain knows about the exchanges?

29:23.688 --> 29:27.222
They do, and they are displeased.

29:30.645 --> 29:32.444
How do you know they know?

29:41.489 --> 29:43.072
So what does that look like?

29:43.124 --> 29:45.708
Return it all or it's the
Rosario raid all over again?

29:45.743 --> 29:48.327
Something like that.

29:51.916 --> 29:54.083
I understand why you did it.

29:55.636 --> 29:57.419
I know what it feels
like to lose everything

29:57.471 --> 30:00.422
and feel powerless to
do anything about it.

30:00.474 --> 30:02.925
The temptation to keep
something to show for it all,

30:02.977 --> 30:05.928
I understand it.

30:05.980 --> 30:09.481
But it does not change
the reality we face.

30:09.517 --> 30:12.568
That you face.

30:12.603 --> 30:15.821
For I assure you, if
Spain invades over this,

30:15.856 --> 30:18.440
yours will be the first face they see.

30:31.038 --> 30:33.672
I heard Henry Avery's
name when I was a boy,

30:33.708 --> 30:38.010
heard the way people spoke
it... grown men in awe of it.

30:40.715 --> 30:44.883
I came to this place so
determined to do the same.

30:46.854 --> 30:50.055
That's not going to happen the
way I thought it was, is it?

30:52.560 --> 30:54.059
It never does.

30:58.899 --> 31:00.366
My advice?

31:02.153 --> 31:05.537
You want some say in
how they speak of you?

31:08.909 --> 31:10.376
Write a book.

31:13.831 --> 31:17.916
Right now, what do you want to do?

31:19.469 --> 31:20.744
Do you have a pen?

31:22.499 --> 31:24.025
He's agreed to cooperate.

31:24.339 --> 31:26.289
One man goes into the
interior to deliver this,

31:26.291 --> 31:28.541
instructions written in
his hand to his partner

31:28.593 --> 31:31.127
to return to Nassau
and surrender the cache.

31:31.129 --> 31:33.129
He said she may be wary,

31:33.181 --> 31:35.598
asked there be only one
messenger to deliver the letter.

31:35.633 --> 31:37.433
Give this to Lieutenant Hersey.

31:37.468 --> 31:38.935
Have him prepare to
depart for the interior.

31:38.970 --> 31:41.103
I'll pass him details momentarily.

31:41.139 --> 31:42.972
He should be made aware Anne
will not be taken lightly.

31:43.024 --> 31:45.608
Well, neither will Lieutenant Hersey.

31:48.780 --> 31:51.364
I understand Jack was arrested today.

31:51.399 --> 31:53.149
I would like to know why.

32:13.554 --> 32:15.388
What happens if he loses?

32:15.423 --> 32:18.174
If he loses, he dies.

32:20.595 --> 32:22.178
I meant what happens to us?

32:24.232 --> 32:25.598
I don't know.

32:26.768 --> 32:29.518
Probably given a chance
to join the fleet,

32:29.570 --> 32:32.104
fold in, and go back on the account.

32:33.941 --> 32:37.994
When your men entreated
me to join your crew,

32:38.029 --> 32:40.496
they said your captain
was a man worth following.

32:40.531 --> 32:43.866
A strong man, a wise man, they said.

32:43.918 --> 32:45.701
But right now I can't tell

32:45.703 --> 32:48.704
which side of this contest
you'd prefer to see prevail.

32:52.543 --> 32:55.211
Can you help me make sense of that?

32:59.217 --> 33:02.101
A few days ago I could
make sense of all of it.

33:03.888 --> 33:07.023
He was going to die and
we were going to be free,

33:07.058 --> 33:10.226
from the account, from him...

33:12.063 --> 33:14.480
With all the shit he's done,
the things he's gotten away with,

33:14.532 --> 33:15.614
that would have been fair.

33:15.650 --> 33:17.650
That would have been right.

33:17.702 --> 33:19.735
I think part of the reason

33:19.737 --> 33:23.456
I've been able to stand by his side

33:23.491 --> 33:25.324
is that I wanted to make
sure I've got a good view

33:25.376 --> 33:28.744
of the moment the world
finally catches up to him...

33:30.965 --> 33:33.632
and this story starts
to make sense again.

33:33.668 --> 33:36.085
This is a matter of honor

33:36.137 --> 33:38.721
to be settled once and for
good in the here and now.

33:38.756 --> 33:40.756
The parties have agreed to combat

33:40.808 --> 33:42.591
and have accepted common practice.

33:42.643 --> 33:44.260
The parties have further agreed

33:44.262 --> 33:47.596
there will be no
quarter asked nor given.

34:15.842 --> 34:18.260
Cock your pistols!

34:22.132 --> 34:23.382
From this moment,

34:23.434 --> 34:26.135
there's to be no movement
until a count of three.

34:28.856 --> 34:30.688
One...

34:30.725 --> 34:32.274
two...

34:32.310 --> 34:34.527
three!

37:41.549 --> 37:43.332
Take him.

37:43.384 --> 37:46.001
And get the fuck off my beach.

38:10.161 --> 38:12.361
If you won't take the opium,

38:12.363 --> 38:15.664
at least take this to bite down on.

38:17.418 --> 38:19.251
Just do it.

39:15.760 --> 39:18.177
The burden I wasn't prepared for...

39:20.898 --> 39:22.848
it isn't the men.

39:24.318 --> 39:26.402
It's him.

39:28.689 --> 39:29.822
Flint?

39:32.359 --> 39:36.361
What he wants, what he needs,

39:36.414 --> 39:38.530
what he fears...

39:39.750 --> 39:41.417
the depths of it...

39:42.586 --> 39:45.671
they are profound and dark.

39:47.208 --> 39:50.209
I serve the crew best by tempering him,

39:50.261 --> 39:53.796
steering him where he's needed.

39:53.848 --> 39:56.265
I've descended into those
depths and connected with him

39:56.300 --> 40:00.135
so that I might be able to do so.

40:00.137 --> 40:04.106
But I am acutely aware that I'm
not the first to have been there...

40:05.559 --> 40:09.528
to have been a partner
to him in this way.

40:09.563 --> 40:13.482
And that the ones that have
seen those depths before...

40:15.953 --> 40:18.153
they never surfaced again.

40:19.990 --> 40:23.292
Maybe their mistake was
in trying to do it alone.

40:25.079 --> 40:27.713
Maybe to go to such a place,

40:27.748 --> 40:30.215
one needs another

40:30.251 --> 40:34.219
to hold the tether
and to find a way out.

40:39.059 --> 40:40.559
Maybe.

41:06.704 --> 41:09.204
I know this cannot
have been easy for you.

41:09.256 --> 41:13.509
I know this is so far from how
you thought things would end.

41:13.544 --> 41:16.628
But I wanted you to
know that the end of this

41:16.680 --> 41:19.715
may not quite be what you think it is.

41:19.767 --> 41:22.050
How's that?

41:23.270 --> 41:24.520
When Anne receives your letter

41:24.555 --> 41:26.939
and returns here with
what remains of the cache,

41:26.974 --> 41:29.391
Nassau will be secured,

41:29.393 --> 41:34.062
and everyone will know that
it is because of Jack Rackham

41:34.448 --> 41:36.732
that it occurred.

41:39.119 --> 41:42.454
I'll have spared Nassau...

41:43.991 --> 41:45.457
and you think the story of it

41:45.492 --> 41:47.459
will be told long after I am gone?

41:47.494 --> 41:48.577
I know it will.

41:48.579 --> 41:50.712
I will make sure of it.

41:51.715 --> 41:54.833
Sounds a lifeless story to me,

41:54.885 --> 41:57.502
and one that requires
commitments before the fact

41:57.555 --> 41:59.254
to ensure its retelling.

41:59.256 --> 42:03.725
When the current story
unfolds, I assure you,

42:03.761 --> 42:07.479
it's going to get around all on its own.

42:07.514 --> 42:09.348
What does that mean?

42:11.602 --> 42:12.768
I walked into this place today

42:12.770 --> 42:16.071
stunned at how quickly
that man downstairs

42:16.106 --> 42:17.739
had completed his conquest,

42:17.775 --> 42:19.441
how thoroughly he had seemed to win

42:19.493 --> 42:21.944
just about everyone I
know over to his side.

42:21.996 --> 42:26.498
The truth of the matter is
there's been no conquest.

42:26.533 --> 42:28.450
It's only the appearance of one.

42:28.502 --> 42:31.954
For conquest is an
either/or proposition.

42:32.006 --> 42:34.423
Either you have it or you do not.

42:34.458 --> 42:36.008
It would appear that without that cache,

42:36.043 --> 42:37.626
he most certainly does not.

42:40.297 --> 42:41.630
Jack, what did you do?

42:43.550 --> 42:44.549
I sent word to Anne

42:44.602 --> 42:47.603
to take the cache and disappear.

42:52.526 --> 42:56.862
No. The governor saw your letter to her.

42:56.897 --> 42:59.648
You don't think I can
convey a thought to Anne

42:59.700 --> 43:01.483
comprehensible only to her?

43:01.535 --> 43:03.068
A thought as simple as "run"?

43:03.120 --> 43:05.621
A letter that said everything
the governor wished it to say

43:05.656 --> 43:06.905
in exactly the way he'd want to say it

43:06.957 --> 43:09.574
would not sound like
anything I'd ever say.

43:09.627 --> 43:11.743
A thought here or two
between the lines...

43:11.795 --> 43:13.662
I assure you, she understood.

43:17.001 --> 43:20.002
So I have begun the duel

43:20.004 --> 43:22.220
between myself and our Lord Governor.

43:22.256 --> 43:24.306
The rules are simple.

43:24.341 --> 43:26.008
I will deny him the cache.

43:26.010 --> 43:29.511
No matter what sort of inducements
he offers or pain he inflicts,

43:29.563 --> 43:31.146
I will deny him the cache,

43:31.181 --> 43:34.349
and so I will deny him the victory.

43:34.401 --> 43:38.403
And in doing so, I will ensure that
whatever Nassau is come Christmas,

43:40.157 --> 43:42.024
English will be not it.

43:53.087 --> 43:54.536
Do not do this.

43:54.588 --> 43:56.621
It's done.

44:08.769 --> 44:11.053
So, one of two outcomes will result.

44:11.105 --> 44:13.221
Rogers will understand his defeat

44:13.223 --> 44:15.357
to be ultimately inevitable
and leave this place,

44:15.392 --> 44:17.392
in which case I'll have it back.

44:17.394 --> 44:21.279
Or he'll stubbornly refuse

44:21.315 --> 44:24.449
and eventually Spain will
raze this place to the ground.

44:24.485 --> 44:26.201
The English flag will burn,

44:26.236 --> 44:29.037
and a second pirate
republic will be born

44:29.073 --> 44:30.288
from the ashes of the first.

44:30.324 --> 44:32.240
Only this time, every
man who calls it home

44:32.292 --> 44:34.910
will know it came about because of me.

45:01.905 --> 45:03.071
I worry...

45:04.358 --> 45:06.775
that we have made a terrible mistake.

45:06.777 --> 45:09.161
I see what you see in them...

45:09.196 --> 45:11.196
Silver and Flint.

45:11.248 --> 45:14.616
But their relationship is so volatile

45:14.668 --> 45:17.786
and we have put our
lives in their hands.

45:19.289 --> 45:23.625
Those men rose to their stations

45:23.677 --> 45:26.845
because they are peerless

45:26.880 --> 45:29.848
when it comes to shaping
the world to their will,

45:29.883 --> 45:33.969
in creating a narrative and wielding it

45:34.021 --> 45:38.140
to compel men's hearts and minds.

45:38.192 --> 45:41.643
But the most compelling story

45:41.645 --> 45:44.312
requires a villain at its center.

45:44.364 --> 45:48.033
And if either Captain
Flint or Mr. Silver

45:50.070 --> 45:51.536
sees the other as a villain...

45:51.572 --> 45:54.122
or worse...

45:54.158 --> 45:56.324
us as that...

45:56.376 --> 45:59.494
then all is lost.

46:01.415 --> 46:06.134
They are of great value to us,

46:06.170 --> 46:10.839
but they must be managed
by us to avoid that outcome.

46:12.426 --> 46:13.675
How?

46:17.598 --> 46:19.681
I wish...

46:19.683 --> 46:23.768
you and I had not been so
separate all those years.

46:26.440 --> 46:28.740
I wish I could have found a way

46:28.775 --> 46:32.611
to be a better father to you.

46:34.748 --> 46:38.533
But over time, I was determined

46:38.585 --> 46:41.036
to leave you something behind,

46:41.088 --> 46:42.537
to give you the one thing

46:42.589 --> 46:46.675
that no one could ever take away...

46:48.212 --> 46:50.262
and that would make you strong enough

46:50.297 --> 46:53.965
to understand their world,

46:54.017 --> 46:56.551
interact with their world...

46:57.437 --> 47:01.857
wage war on their world.

47:01.892 --> 47:05.060
But if their identity
lies in their stories,

47:05.062 --> 47:06.311
I wanted you to know them

47:06.363 --> 47:09.731
so that when we are ready
to call them enemies,

47:09.783 --> 47:12.567
you would be ready for it.

47:12.569 --> 47:15.320
The villain makes the story.

47:15.372 --> 47:16.905
So to manage our current partners,

47:16.907 --> 47:20.492
we must ensure that we
all agree at all times

47:20.544 --> 47:23.461
who our common villain is.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.417
The fugitive's name is Anne Bonny.

47:29.419 --> 47:31.753
She's going for a capture of £500.

47:34.424 --> 47:37.092
... several miles away
on the road out of town.

47:43.684 --> 47:45.317
Earlier today,

47:45.352 --> 47:48.653
before we knew Rackham
was still on the island,

47:48.689 --> 47:52.774
you seemed confident that we could
locate him and his friend in time.

47:53.493 --> 47:54.609
You said it was possible

47:54.611 --> 47:58.413
because they didn't know
that we were looking for them.

47:58.448 --> 48:02.584
Why do I get the feeling,
now that they do know,

48:02.619 --> 48:04.920
now that they've made
it their personal crusade

48:04.955 --> 48:06.671
to see this regime fail,

48:06.707 --> 48:09.341
that your estimate will
be far less optimistic?

48:12.012 --> 48:13.295
The militia will help.

48:13.347 --> 48:15.297
It will keep the pressure on,
and perhaps we'll get lucky.

48:15.349 --> 48:17.799
But if we don't, then you
may have to be prepared...

48:17.851 --> 48:20.435
Oh, I'm prepared to do anything.

48:23.690 --> 48:27.609
Anne Bonny must be found.

48:27.644 --> 48:30.695
The cache must be found.

48:30.731 --> 48:32.948
Right now, that is all that matters.

48:35.452 --> 48:37.652
And that said,

48:37.654 --> 48:39.571
the goodwill that we have engendered

48:39.623 --> 48:43.708
among the people of Nassau
is not without limits.

48:43.744 --> 48:47.629
The longer this drags out,
the riskier it becomes,

48:47.664 --> 48:50.548
because if I find that money
only to lose the street...

48:50.584 --> 48:52.083
You will not.

48:54.004 --> 48:58.223
If you have me, then
you have the street.

48:58.258 --> 49:01.009
I am all the reassurance they need.

49:01.011 --> 49:05.680
Yes, Jack and Anne were
my partners, my friends.

49:07.901 --> 49:09.067
More.

49:09.820 --> 49:11.186
But now they have made themselves

49:11.238 --> 49:12.821
something else to me.

49:12.856 --> 49:16.191
I have sacrificed too much
to build something here.

49:16.243 --> 49:19.577
I will not let them take it away.

49:56.900 --> 50:01.236
All he ever did was
offer me his friendship.

50:01.238 --> 50:05.740
I cast him aside once,
spent years regretting it.

50:07.210 --> 50:09.878
And now here we are again.

50:12.632 --> 50:14.833
Tell me I didn't do it for nothing.

50:17.087 --> 50:19.137
Well, I won't lie to you.

50:20.424 --> 50:21.890
It would have helped having the fleet.

50:29.015 --> 50:33.768
We have assets, we have allies.

50:33.820 --> 50:36.688
The question is what we make of them.

50:36.740 --> 50:39.691
I may be able to help in that regard.

50:40.861 --> 50:44.195
Something to add to our pool of assets.

50:46.199 --> 50:50.335
Before Ocracoke, we came upon a prize...

50:50.370 --> 50:52.036
a Spanish prize

50:52.089 --> 50:55.874
ferrying a significant
trove of intelligence.

50:55.926 --> 50:58.042
Most of it was destroyed
by the time we found it,

50:58.095 --> 51:02.630
but among the remains was
one piece of information,

51:02.682 --> 51:04.716
something everyone else
was quick to dismiss

51:04.768 --> 51:08.136
as it held no value
to them in that moment.

51:08.188 --> 51:09.971
Information about what?

51:09.973 --> 51:12.390
Money...

51:12.442 --> 51:15.026
separated from the Urca
gold within the fort

51:15.061 --> 51:17.695
and rendered into a new form...

51:17.731 --> 51:19.647
a cache of gems

51:19.699 --> 51:23.868
for which Spain is holding
the new governor accountable.

51:23.904 --> 51:27.322
A cache which, if used creatively,

51:27.324 --> 51:31.960
could be the key to defeating
British forces in Nassau.

51:31.995 --> 51:33.995
The only question is,

51:35.397 --> 51:36.731
can we find it before he does?
