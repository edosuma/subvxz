01:20.339 --> 01:22.807
<i>A survey was taken
a few years ago that asked</i>

01:22.809 --> 01:25.109
<i>three hundred professionals
one question.</i>

01:25.111 --> 01:27.681
<i>"What's the worst thing
that can happen in sports?"</i>

01:31.051 --> 01:33.385
<i>Some people answered,
losing at game seven.</i>

01:33.387 --> 01:38.156
<i>He scores,
Bruins win in seven games!</i>

01:38.158 --> 01:40.358
<i>And other people
said getting swept in 4.</i>

01:42.929 --> 01:45.730
<i>Some people said it was
missing the World Cup.</i>

01:45.732 --> 01:47.132
<i>Guatemala is eliminated!</i>

01:47.134 --> 01:49.266
<i>Goal!</i>

01:49.268 --> 01:52.236
<i>And some Brazilian said
it was losing to Argentina.</i>

01:52.238 --> 01:56.975
<i>Not just in the World Cup.
Any time, ever, in any contest.</i>

01:56.977 --> 01:58.944
<i>But one person answered
that the worst thing</i>

01:58.946 --> 02:03.013
<i>that can happen in sports is
fourth place at the Olympics.</i>

02:03.015 --> 02:05.049
<i>This is a true story,
but except for my own</i>

02:05.051 --> 02:07.052
<i>I've changed all the names
and I've done my best</i>

02:07.054 --> 02:10.788
<i>to obscure identities for
reasons that'll become clear.</i>

02:10.789 --> 02:12.057
<i>I'm Molly Bloom.</i>

02:12.059 --> 02:14.258
<i>And right now, I'm ranked third
in North America</i>

02:14.260 --> 02:15.760
<i>in Woman's Moguls.</i>

02:15.762 --> 02:17.295
<i>I grew up
in Loveland, Colorado</i>

02:17.297 --> 02:18.796
<i>about two hours
north of Denver.</i>

02:18.798 --> 02:20.498
<i>I have a B.A.
in Political Science</i>

02:20.500 --> 02:21.933
<i>from the University
of Colorado</i>

02:21.935 --> 02:23.969
<i>where I graduated
Summa Cum Laude</i>

02:23.971 --> 02:26.103
<i>with a 3.9 GPA.</i>

02:26.105 --> 02:29.941
<i>The median L-Sat score
at Harvard Law School is 169.</i>

02:29.943 --> 02:31.476
<i>My score is 173.</i>

02:31.478 --> 02:33.878
Number 87, up!
Fifty six on deck!

02:33.880 --> 02:36.014
<i>I've spent 16 years
chasing winter</i>

02:36.016 --> 02:38.949
<i>and being coached
by the best in the world.</i>

02:38.951 --> 02:40.652
<i>Sundays were for working out
with my father.</i>

02:40.654 --> 02:42.454
Something's really wrong.

02:42.456 --> 02:43.488
<i>When I was 12 years old</i>

02:43.490 --> 02:44.521
<i>for no particular reason</i>

02:44.523 --> 02:45.890
<i>my back exploded.</i>

02:45.892 --> 02:47.725
Tough it out.

02:47.727 --> 02:49.927
- Good advice.
- And lose the attitude.

02:49.929 --> 02:51.362
<i>Less than 10
minutes later, I was in</i>

02:51.364 --> 02:53.564
<i>the back of an ambulance.</i>

02:53.566 --> 02:55.834
<i>I had what's called
rapid onset scoliosis.</i>

02:55.836 --> 02:57.868
<i>My spine was curved
at 63 degrees</i>

02:57.870 --> 02:59.903
<i>and I'd need a seven hour
surgical procedure</i>

02:59.905 --> 03:01.772
<i>that involved
straightening my spine</i>

03:01.774 --> 03:03.207
<i>extracting bone from my hip</i>

03:03.209 --> 03:04.776
<i>fusing 11 vertebrae together</i>

03:04.778 --> 03:06.745
<i>and fastening steel rods
to the fused segments.</i>

03:06.747 --> 03:08.847
- She's gonna be fine.
- Oh!

03:08.849 --> 03:11.983
I wouldn't let her ski anymore,
definitely not Moguls.

03:11.985 --> 03:14.318
<i>And obviously
skiing competitively</i>

03:14.320 --> 03:15.722
<i>is out of the question.</i>

03:17.156 --> 03:19.324
Oh, God, thank you.

03:19.326 --> 03:21.058
<i>I was on skis again in a year.</i>

03:21.060 --> 03:22.494
<i>Running Moguls in 18 months</i>

03:22.495 --> 03:23.728
<i>and by my 20th birthday</i>

03:23.730 --> 03:25.096
<i>I made the U.S. Ski Team.</i>

03:25.098 --> 03:26.630
<i>It's the last round
of qualifying</i>

03:26.632 --> 03:28.233
<i>for the Salt Lake City
Olympics.</i>

03:28.235 --> 03:30.200
<i>This is the champion run
at Deer Valley.</i>

03:30.202 --> 03:31.669
<i>The altitude is 8100 feet.</i>

03:31.671 --> 03:33.204
<i>And the pitch is 52 degrees</i>

03:33.206 --> 03:35.740
<i>which is the same as the sides
of the great pyramids.</i>

03:35.742 --> 03:38.977
<i>The wind's 20 to 25 miles
an hour blowing left to right.</i>

03:38.979 --> 03:41.179
<i>It's 3 below zero
at the top of the slope.</i>

03:41.181 --> 03:43.548
<i>And with seventeen skiers
in front of me</i>

03:43.550 --> 03:45.116
<i>it's gonna be like trying
to stick a landing</i>

03:45.118 --> 03:46.617
<i>on a frozen infinity pool.</i>

03:46.619 --> 03:48.052
Kiki blew out of her line.

03:48.054 --> 03:50.055
<i>Shannon was off balance
on her second landing.</i>

03:50.057 --> 03:51.423
<i>He's talking about Kiki Bandy</i>

03:51.425 --> 03:52.491
<i>and Shannon Keebler</i>

03:52.493 --> 03:53.891
<i>my two toughest competitors</i>

03:53.893 --> 03:55.627
<i>who had significant
point deductions</i>

03:55.629 --> 03:57.594
<i>on their final runs.</i>

03:57.596 --> 03:58.796
<i>I can make the Olympic team.</i>

03:58.798 --> 04:00.664
- <i>Right now.</i>
- Go get it.

04:00.666 --> 04:02.400
<i>And if I have three prefect
runs in Salt Lake</i>

04:02.402 --> 04:04.235
<i>the best runs of my life</i>

04:04.237 --> 04:06.771
<i>I can beat the Austrians
and the Swiss</i>

04:06.773 --> 04:08.806
<i>and have a realistic shot
at the podium.</i>

04:08.808 --> 04:10.775
<i>Then law school
and then a start up.</i>

04:10.777 --> 04:14.145
<i>A foundation that seeds
entrepreneurial women.</i>

04:14.147 --> 04:15.947
<i>My father's
at the bottom of the slope</i>

04:15.949 --> 04:17.716
<i>telepathically telling me
to check my line.</i>

04:17.718 --> 04:20.851
- Check your line.
- <i>I check my line.</i>

04:20.853 --> 04:22.523
<i>Ready?</i>

04:27.260 --> 04:29.259
<i>Good snow contact.
Calm upper body.</i>

04:29.261 --> 04:31.896
<i>Legs together. Good shape.
No line deviation.</i>

04:31.898 --> 04:34.068
<i>Set up for the D-Spin and...</i>

04:36.001 --> 04:37.568
<i>stick the landing.</i>

04:37.570 --> 04:38.770
<i>Now, two things you need
to know</i>

04:38.772 --> 04:40.003
<i>before the second trick</i>

04:40.005 --> 04:41.438
<i>which will be a 720.</i>

04:41.440 --> 04:43.073
<i>The first is that
when visibility is bad</i>

04:43.075 --> 04:45.777
<i>the way it is now,
race officials toss pine boughs</i>

04:45.779 --> 04:47.578
<i>on the course
so the skiers have some</i>

04:47.580 --> 04:49.214
<i>foreground depth reference.</i>

04:49.216 --> 04:51.282
<i>The second is that
the tightness of your bindings</i>

04:51.284 --> 04:53.383
<i>is determined by what's
called a DIN setting.</i>

04:53.385 --> 04:55.986
<i>If you're a beginner, your DIN
setting is probably a 2 or 3.</i>

04:55.988 --> 04:57.955
<i>If you're an experienced
weekend skier</i>

04:57.957 --> 05:00.157
<i>it's probably seven or eight.
Mine's fifteen.</i>

05:00.159 --> 05:03.294
<i>My boots are basically welded
to my skis, right?</i>

05:03.296 --> 05:06.664
<i>So how does this happen?</i>

05:06.666 --> 05:08.465
<i>It happened
because I hit a pine bough</i>

05:08.467 --> 05:10.568
<i>that had become frozen
in the snow.</i>

05:10.570 --> 05:12.337
<i>And I hit it so precisely</i>

05:12.339 --> 05:14.839
<i>that it simply snapped
the release of my bindings.</i>

05:14.841 --> 05:16.306
<i>Right in that moment
I didn't have time</i>

05:16.308 --> 05:18.008
<i>to calculate the odds
of that happening</i>

05:18.010 --> 05:19.777
<i>because I was about
to land pretty hard</i>

05:19.779 --> 05:21.746
<i>on my digitally re-mastered
spinal cord</i>

05:21.748 --> 05:23.515
<i>which was being held together
by spare parts</i>

05:23.517 --> 05:24.985
<i>from an Erector Set.</i>

05:30.757 --> 05:33.427
<i>- Give her room!
- Get out of the way! Move!</i>

05:38.998 --> 05:41.065
<i>None of this has
anything to do with poker.</i>

05:41.067 --> 05:43.034
<i>I'm only mentioning it
because I wanted to say to</i>

05:43.036 --> 05:44.669
<i>whoever answered that the worst
thing that could happen</i>

05:44.671 --> 05:47.304
<i>in sports was 4th place
at the Olympics...</i>

05:47.306 --> 05:49.109
<i>Seriously? Fuck you.</i>

06:42.361 --> 06:44.962
- Hello?
- Molly Bloom?

06:44.964 --> 06:47.498
- <i>Is this Molly Bloom?</i>
- Yes.

06:47.500 --> 06:49.868
<i>This is Special
Agent Tomasino of the FBI.</i>

06:49.870 --> 06:51.768
<i>We have a warrant
for your arrest.</i>

06:51.770 --> 06:53.037
- Sorry?
- <i>We're outside your door.</i>

06:53.039 --> 06:55.573
<i>We want you
to come out here. Okay?</i>

06:55.575 --> 06:58.042
<i>Listen to me now. Make sure
we can see your hands.</i>

06:58.044 --> 06:58.909
Who is this?

06:58.911 --> 07:00.611
<i>This is Special Agent Tomasino</i>

07:00.613 --> 07:01.912
<i>of the FBI, Miss Bloom.</i>

07:01.914 --> 07:03.313
<i>You've got 30 seconds to open</i>

07:03.315 --> 07:05.082
<i>your door
or we're breaking it down.</i>

07:05.084 --> 07:07.551
<i>Do you understand
what I just said?</i>

07:14.193 --> 07:16.527
<i>Hands in the air!</i>

07:16.529 --> 07:19.063
<i>Put your hands in the air!</i>

07:19.065 --> 07:21.465
- There's been a mistake.
- <i>Are you Molly Bloom?</i>

07:21.467 --> 07:25.869
<i>I want you to walk toward me
very slowly. Okay? Go ahead.</i>

07:25.871 --> 07:28.508
- I'm...
- <i>Slower. Slower. Slow down.</i>

07:29.541 --> 07:31.142
<i>Come on. Come on.</i>

07:31.144 --> 07:33.777
I'm having a hard time seeing,
the, the flashlights in my eyes.

07:33.779 --> 07:37.248
- <i>Walk slower.</i>
- Yes, sir.

07:37.250 --> 07:40.784
<i>Hands on the wall.
Spread your arms and legs.</i>

07:40.786 --> 07:42.619
<i>Is there anyone
in your apartment right now?</i>

07:42.621 --> 07:43.988
Uh, no, sir.

07:43.990 --> 07:45.455
Are there any firearms
in your apartment right now?

07:45.457 --> 07:47.558
- No, sir.
- Go.

07:47.560 --> 07:49.928
You're under arrest for running
an illegal gambling operation.

07:49.930 --> 07:51.996
- <i>Do you understand?</i>
- Uh, yes.

07:51.998 --> 07:53.965
<i>Say you understand.</i>

07:53.967 --> 07:56.000
I understand, but
there's been a mistake.

07:56.002 --> 07:57.534
Because I haven't
run a game in two years.

07:57.536 --> 07:58.635
<i>I want you to take a look at</i>

07:58.637 --> 08:00.203
<i>this piece of paper right here.</i>

08:00.205 --> 08:01.875
<i>Can you see what
it says at the top?</i>

08:04.010 --> 08:04.909
Yes.

08:04.911 --> 08:07.611
Read to me
what it says at the top.

08:07.613 --> 08:10.885
"United States of America
vs. Molly Bloom."

08:13.620 --> 08:15.189
I bet heavy on the favorite.

08:17.957 --> 08:19.222
<i>Alright, what do you, um...</i>

08:19.224 --> 08:21.492
<i>think about
the following concepts?</i>

08:21.494 --> 08:22.859
<i>Just gonna run them by you.</i>

08:22.861 --> 08:26.965
- <i>Marriage.</i>
- It is a trap.

08:26.967 --> 08:29.969
<i>- Society?
- It is a joke.</i>

08:31.303 --> 08:33.604
<i>People.</i>

08:33.606 --> 08:36.577
I... think there's good and bad.

08:38.544 --> 08:40.013
But I don't trust them.

08:41.246 --> 08:43.647
I don't trust people.

08:43.649 --> 08:45.282
<i>Every year on our
birthdays, my father would</i>

08:45.284 --> 08:47.385
<i>interview my younger
brothers and me.</i>

08:47.387 --> 08:49.887
<i>Who are the heroes
or heroines in your life?</i>

08:49.889 --> 08:53.724
<i>Who, uh... who do you
really respect?</i>

08:53.726 --> 08:55.426
I don't have any heroes.

08:55.428 --> 08:57.228
<i>You don't have any heroes.</i>

08:57.230 --> 08:58.963
<i>How's this for hubris?</i>

08:58.965 --> 09:01.099
I don't.

09:01.101 --> 09:04.201
Because if I reach the goals
I set out for myself

09:04.203 --> 09:08.071
then the person I become,
that'll be my hero.

09:08.073 --> 09:10.074
<i>Even by teenage girl standards</i>

09:10.076 --> 09:11.942
<i>I would appear
to be irrationally angry</i>

09:11.944 --> 09:13.610
<i>at nothing in particular.</i>

09:13.612 --> 09:17.581
<i>It would be another 22 years
before I'd find out why.</i>

09:17.583 --> 09:19.617
<i>After my colossal wipe out
at Deer Valley</i>

09:19.619 --> 09:22.488
<i>I decided to take a year off
before law school.</i>

09:22.490 --> 09:24.955
<i>I needed to go away,
sever myself from reality</i>

09:24.957 --> 09:26.990
<i>and come up with a new plan.</i>

09:26.992 --> 09:29.027
<i>So I chose Los Angeles.</i>

09:29.029 --> 09:30.695
<i>A friend of mine
from the ski team</i>

09:30.697 --> 09:33.464
<i>had agreed to let me crash
on her couch for a while.</i>

09:33.466 --> 09:35.932
<i>My father had disapproved
of postponing law school</i>

09:35.934 --> 09:37.868
<i>and so, declined to help out.</i>

09:37.870 --> 09:40.772
<i>But I had $1700 dollars I'd
saved from babysitting money</i>

09:40.774 --> 09:44.642
<i>and that would support me until
I found a waitressing job.</i>

09:44.644 --> 09:47.677
<i>I'd already had a career
and retired from it.</i>

09:47.679 --> 09:51.782
<i>I wanted to be young
for a while in warm weather.</i>

09:51.784 --> 09:55.920
<i>I think that's what I wanted at
first. It's hard to remember.</i>

09:55.922 --> 09:58.256
<i>I got a job working
bottle service at a club</i>

09:58.258 --> 10:01.359
<i>in Hollywood
called "Nacional Nightclub."</i>

10:01.361 --> 10:03.393
<i>It was Cuban themed,
so my uniform</i>

10:03.395 --> 10:06.000
<i>was camouflaged short-shorts
and a wife beater.</i>

10:07.467 --> 10:09.333
<i>The promoter would go over
which record producer</i>

10:09.335 --> 10:12.036
<i>was sitting where, which
hot designers, which Lakers</i>

10:12.038 --> 10:14.872
<i>and Borislava the Bulgarian
billionaire, who didn't drink.</i>

10:14.874 --> 10:17.340
<i>But he ran a $100,000 bar tab.</i>

10:17.342 --> 10:18.875
<i>My job was
to get people to spend</i>

10:18.877 --> 10:20.677
<i>more money than they needed to.</i>

10:20.679 --> 10:22.013
Could we get a bottle of Skyy?

10:22.015 --> 10:23.381
You guys look like
you deserve Grey Goose.

10:23.383 --> 10:25.950
What do guys who deserve
Grey Goose look like?

10:25.952 --> 10:26.984
To begin with,
they've got a bottle

10:26.986 --> 10:28.386
of Grey Goose in front of them.

10:28.388 --> 10:30.489
You're quick. Very clever.

10:30.491 --> 10:32.690
Uh, alright, yeah. Grey Goose.

10:32.692 --> 10:34.959
<i>They just spent an
additional $300 dollars</i>

10:34.961 --> 10:36.993
<i>bringing their total
to $900 dollars</i>

10:36.995 --> 10:39.430
<i>for $8 and 50 cents
worth of vodka.</i>

10:39.432 --> 10:41.331
<i>But the club doesn't
need you to buy a bottle.</i>

10:41.333 --> 10:42.999
<i>They need you
to buy five bottles.</i>

10:43.001 --> 10:44.502
<i>So these girls over here</i>

10:44.504 --> 10:46.436
<i>they let you buy them
shots for a living.</i>

10:46.438 --> 10:48.205
<i>It would be like waiting
in a long line to get into</i>

10:48.207 --> 10:50.675
<i>the Gap so you can pay
1000% percent mark-up</i>

10:50.677 --> 10:53.346
<i>to buy all the employees
a pair of pants.</i>

10:55.447 --> 10:57.882
<i>I only had one shift a week.
I didn't wanna tell my parents</i>

10:57.884 --> 11:00.383
<i>I was a cocktail waitress and
back then, I never turned down</i>

11:00.385 --> 11:02.253
<i>an opportunity
to make more money.</i>

11:02.255 --> 11:04.354
<i>So I found a second job
as an office assistant.</i>

11:04.356 --> 11:06.990
<i>And that's how I ended up
working for Dean Keith.</i>

11:08.595 --> 11:11.428
<i>Dean was a partner
in Black Hues Investments.</i>

11:11.430 --> 11:13.797
<i>He was a regular at the club,
and one night he said...</i>

11:13.799 --> 11:15.269
People seem to take to you.

11:16.769 --> 11:18.768
Hey, how would you like to
get paid to go to grad school

11:18.770 --> 11:20.504
and get an MBA
in how life works?

11:20.506 --> 11:22.607
What makes you think
you know and I don't?

11:22.609 --> 11:25.542
I'm a regular here
and you're a waitress here.

11:25.544 --> 11:27.210
Look at the fuckin' scoreboard.

11:27.212 --> 11:29.513
<i>Dean explained what
my job was by saying...</i>

11:29.515 --> 11:32.484
Me. I'm your job.

11:32.486 --> 11:35.253
<i>I answered the phone, made
coffee runs, set appointments.</i>

11:35.255 --> 11:37.053
- <i>Made spread sheets.</i>
- What is that?

11:37.055 --> 11:38.623
<i>And showed Dean
what a spreadsheet was.</i>

11:38.625 --> 11:40.157
Spreadsheet.

11:40.159 --> 11:42.259
<i>But I made $450 dollars
a week on top</i>

11:42.261 --> 11:44.327
<i>of the $300
I was making at the club.</i>

11:44.329 --> 11:47.431
<i>Which would be enough
to get off my friend's couch.</i>

11:47.433 --> 11:49.867
<i>I remember the day started
by being about bagels.</i>

11:49.869 --> 11:51.101
- This is Molly.
- <i>Get to the office.</i>

11:51.103 --> 11:52.772
<i>Pick up bagels.</i>

11:54.807 --> 11:56.673
Do you mean now?

11:56.675 --> 11:59.210
<i>Dean was a Hollywood staple.</i>

11:59.212 --> 12:01.045
<i>Over leveraged. Going broke.</i>

12:01.047 --> 12:02.879
<i>Trying to prove
he wasn't broke and making</i>

12:02.881 --> 12:05.849
<i>a true effort to be
as vulgar as possible.</i>

12:05.851 --> 12:07.652
<i>Honestly making an effort.</i>

12:07.654 --> 12:09.452
<i>I hadn't told anyone
I was a skier</i>

12:09.454 --> 12:11.221
<i>and it was hard not
to laugh when Dean said...</i>

12:11.223 --> 12:12.822
Anyone ever teach you
how to fuckin' hurry?

12:12.824 --> 12:15.292
- No.
- What are those?

12:15.294 --> 12:16.860
Bagels.

12:16.862 --> 12:18.262
- Are these from Blue Bell?
- Yeah.

12:18.264 --> 12:20.431
- It's on the way from my house.
- Seriously?

12:20.433 --> 12:23.767
You might as well have stopped
at a fuckin' homeless shelter!

12:23.769 --> 12:25.036
You might as well
have walked into

12:25.038 --> 12:27.504
a mother fucking
homeless shelter and said

12:27.506 --> 12:30.641
"I'd like a dozen bagels from
this homeless shelter, please."

12:30.643 --> 12:35.178
I do not eat bagels
from Blue-fucking-Bell, Molly

12:35.180 --> 12:38.916
because these
are poor people bagels!

12:38.918 --> 12:40.250
From where would you like me
to get your bagels...

12:40.252 --> 12:41.786
Forget about the fuckin' bagels.

12:41.788 --> 12:42.887
- Done.
- <i>Except smarten up.</i>

12:42.889 --> 12:44.287
- Got it.
- Hang on.

12:44.289 --> 12:45.855
<i>Like I said, the day started</i>

12:45.857 --> 12:49.226
<i>by being about bagels,
but that would abruptly change.</i>

12:49.228 --> 12:51.229
My weekly poker game
is moving to the Cobra Lounge.

12:51.231 --> 12:53.196
Tomorrow night,
and then every Tuesday night.

12:53.198 --> 12:54.331
You'll help run it.

12:54.333 --> 12:55.865
Take these names and numbers.

12:55.867 --> 12:57.468
Tell them to bring
ten grand in cash

12:57.471 --> 13:00.374
for the first buy-in.
The blinds are 51/100.

13:01.607 --> 13:02.940
- And Molly.
- Yeah.

13:02.942 --> 13:04.577
Don't fucking tell anybody.

13:11.750 --> 13:15.319
<i>I'd regarded Dean as a
nitwit when I regarded him at all.</i>

13:15.321 --> 13:18.256
<i>But on that pad were nine names
along with phone numbers of</i>

13:18.258 --> 13:21.459
<i>some of the wealthiest and most
famous people in the world.</i>

13:21.461 --> 13:24.594
<i>I put the numbers in my phone
and composed a simple message.</i>

13:24.596 --> 13:27.031
<i>There'd be a game tomorrow
night at the Cobra Lounge.</i>

13:27.033 --> 13:28.936
<i>There was
a $10,000 dollar buy-in.</i>

13:31.404 --> 13:33.573
<i>All nine players confirmed
that they'd be there.</i>

13:36.675 --> 13:40.076
<i>All within 90 seconds
of my sending the text.</i>

13:40.078 --> 13:43.481
<i>The Cobra Lounge sits on
the edge of the Sunset Strip.</i>

13:43.483 --> 13:46.450
<i>And in it's heyday was famous
for introducing unknown bands</i>

13:46.452 --> 13:49.519
<i>like "The Doors"
and "The Beach Boys."</i>

13:49.521 --> 13:52.056
<i>All I knew was school work
and skiing.</i>

13:52.058 --> 13:53.657
<i>I'd always figured
sophistication</i>

13:53.659 --> 13:55.660
<i>would be easy to learn
if I ever needed it.</i>

13:55.662 --> 13:57.662
<i>My cheese platter had
a sticker that read</i>

13:57.664 --> 14:01.232
<i>"Cheese From the Great State
of Michigan."</i>

14:01.234 --> 14:03.434
<i>Diego, a professional dealer</i>

14:03.436 --> 14:06.336
<i>was setting up the table
when I got there.</i>

14:06.338 --> 14:08.372
<i>I Googled "What type of music</i>

14:08.374 --> 14:10.407
<i>do poker players
like to listen to?"</i>

14:10.409 --> 14:12.209
<i>and then tried to figure out
how to make a playlist</i>

14:12.211 --> 14:14.244
<i>out of one Kenny Rogers song.</i>

14:14.246 --> 14:17.080
<i>I set up the bar...</i>

14:17.082 --> 14:18.682
<i>put out my cheese platter...</i>

14:18.684 --> 14:20.350
<i>and positioned myself
at the door where I'd been</i>

14:20.352 --> 14:21.618
<i>instructed to only let in</i>

14:21.620 --> 14:23.219
<i>the names on the list.</i>

14:23.221 --> 14:24.788
<i>I was wearing my best dress,
which I had bought</i>

14:24.790 --> 14:28.258
<i>two years earlier
at J.C. Penney for $88.</i>

14:28.260 --> 14:30.293
<i>The players started to arrive.</i>

14:30.295 --> 14:32.763
<i>I introduced myself as Molly,
Dean's assistant.</i>

14:32.765 --> 14:33.933
For you.

14:35.367 --> 14:37.203
<i>Asked if I could
get them a drink.</i>

14:40.807 --> 14:44.111
<i>And took from each of them
$10,000 in cash.</i>

14:46.578 --> 14:48.812
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:48.814 --> 14:49.982
I'm...

14:52.684 --> 14:53.917
I know.

14:53.919 --> 14:55.985
- Your boss...
- Everybody here?

14:55.987 --> 14:57.320
- Yeah.
- Hey, buddy.

14:57.322 --> 14:59.159
Fuck off,
I'm gonna own your shit.

15:00.425 --> 15:02.892
Ugly dress.
Ugly shoes.

15:02.894 --> 15:04.364
Let's play!

15:06.999 --> 15:09.532
<i>Diego fanned nine
cards out on the table</i>

15:09.534 --> 15:11.704
<i>and the players
chose for seats.</i>

15:21.179 --> 15:23.080
<i>Eleven and eleven...</i>

15:23.082 --> 15:25.282
<i>He checked,
the action's on you.</i>

15:25.284 --> 15:28.918
<i>I just finished
counting out $90,000 in cash.</i>

15:28.920 --> 15:33.791
<i>I was in a room
with movie stars, directors.</i>

15:33.793 --> 15:36.292
<i>Rappers. Boxers.</i>

15:36.294 --> 15:38.265
<i>- He's in trouble.
- And business titans.</i>

15:39.499 --> 15:42.399
<i>They were going all in,
all the time.</i>

15:42.401 --> 15:45.136
<i>Burning through their
buy-ins over and over.</i>

15:45.138 --> 15:47.504
<i>- Here you go. Good luck
- Thank you so much.</i>

15:47.506 --> 15:49.840
I don't know.

15:49.842 --> 15:53.042
<i>I Googled every word
I heard that I didn't know.</i>

15:53.044 --> 15:54.445
- <i>Flop. River.</i>
- Fourth Street.

15:54.447 --> 15:56.480
<i>Fourth Street. Tilt. Cooler.</i>

15:56.482 --> 15:58.648
<i>- Boat. Nuts.
- Yeah, he's pot committed.</i>

15:58.650 --> 15:59.651
<i>Playing the rush.</i>

16:02.521 --> 16:03.988
You keeping track
of the buy-ins?

16:03.990 --> 16:06.590
- Yeah.
- Where? Where's the paper?

16:06.592 --> 16:07.792
Spreadsheet.

16:14.332 --> 16:15.802
<i>Yeah, motherfucker.</i>

16:19.038 --> 16:20.475
All in.

16:22.308 --> 16:23.773
<i>The game ended at 3:30.</i>

16:23.775 --> 16:25.810
<i>And when it did,
that's when Dean shouted out...</i>

16:25.812 --> 16:30.947
Hey, tip Molly if you wanna
get invited back next week.

16:30.949 --> 16:32.583
<i>Tip Molly.</i>

16:32.585 --> 16:36.019
<i>Deep down, I didn't like
the sound of that.</i>

16:36.021 --> 16:37.521
<i>Deep down, I knew
that when your boss says...</i>

16:37.523 --> 16:38.822
- And Molly.
- Yeah.

16:38.824 --> 16:40.657
Don't fucking tell anybody.

16:40.659 --> 16:41.892
<i>That's usually
not the beginning</i>

16:41.894 --> 16:43.160
<i>of a promising law career.</i>

16:43.162 --> 16:44.697
See you next week.

16:47.098 --> 16:49.300
<i>But that was deep down.</i>

16:49.302 --> 16:51.303
<i>I just made $3000.</i>

17:16.928 --> 17:18.694
What are you reading?

17:18.696 --> 17:20.163
"The Crucible."

17:20.165 --> 17:21.763
For school?

17:21.766 --> 17:23.236
My father assigned it.

17:26.571 --> 17:29.240
Do you know how many witches
were burned at Salem?

17:29.242 --> 17:30.840
- How many?
- None.

17:30.842 --> 17:33.343
They didn't burn witches.
It's a myth. They hanged them.

17:33.345 --> 17:36.549
Or drowned them, or crushed them
with heavy rocks.

17:38.517 --> 17:40.251
Wait. Aren't...
You're Molly Bloom.

17:40.253 --> 17:42.218
- Right?
- Yeah.

17:42.220 --> 17:44.655
You don't look the same
as in your photos.

17:44.657 --> 17:46.126
None of us do.

17:47.293 --> 17:49.126
- Molly.
- Yes.

17:49.128 --> 17:50.660
- I'm Charlie Jaffey.
- Oh.

17:50.662 --> 17:52.629
Thank you again
for seeing me so early.

17:52.631 --> 17:55.032
- This is my daughter, Stella.
- We met.

17:55.034 --> 17:57.667
Isabel will be here in 45
minutes to take you to school.

17:57.669 --> 17:59.503
- Finish your math?
- Yeah.

17:59.505 --> 18:01.437
- Civ? You know it?
- Yeah.

18:01.439 --> 18:03.006
<i>Could you teach it
in class today?</i>

18:03.008 --> 18:06.409
If I asked you to teach me
Roman Law, could you do it?

18:06.411 --> 18:08.547
- Yes.
- <i>Okay.</i>

18:10.448 --> 18:12.484
So. First things first.

18:12.486 --> 18:14.407
When was the last time you
slept? Today's Friday.

18:15.418 --> 18:17.320
Tuesday morning at 5 a.m.,
I was arrested by the FBI.

18:17.322 --> 18:19.557
I spent Tuesday
in L.A. County Jail.

18:19.559 --> 18:21.257
I was assessed to be
a minimal flight risk

18:21.259 --> 18:22.993
and bail was set
at a $100,000.

18:22.995 --> 18:24.695
My mother signed over her house.

18:24.697 --> 18:26.696
I was released on Wednesday
and ordered to appear

18:26.698 --> 18:29.934
in Federal Court
in New York's Southern District.

18:29.936 --> 18:31.635
10 a.m. today.

18:31.637 --> 18:32.672
In here.

18:33.505 --> 18:35.175
<i>Close that, will you?</i>

18:38.843 --> 18:41.811
I flew here Wednesday and met
with five attorneys yesterday.

18:41.813 --> 18:44.715
Have a seat.
You didn't hire any of them?

18:44.717 --> 18:46.417
Three of them had
already been taken.

18:46.419 --> 18:48.551
Yeah, 31 people were named
in your indictment.

18:48.553 --> 18:50.020
It's Black Friday
for criminal lawyers.

18:50.022 --> 18:51.254
How about the other two?

18:51.256 --> 18:52.322
One told me money was his

18:52.324 --> 18:53.756
second favorite form of payment.

18:53.758 --> 18:55.224
- I know him.
- <i>The fifth was also taken.</i>

18:55.226 --> 18:57.461
- But he recommended I call you.
- Why?

18:57.463 --> 18:58.995
I told him I wanted someone
who'd worked in

18:58.997 --> 19:01.700
the prosecutor's office and
wasn't even a little bit shady.

19:04.035 --> 19:06.235
Do you know about me?

19:06.237 --> 19:09.039
Um, I've been briefed a little
by my daughter, who knows

19:09.041 --> 19:11.507
a lot about your story
because her mother's a moron.

19:11.509 --> 19:14.744
- Her mother reads the tabloids?
- Yeah, and I read them too.

19:14.746 --> 19:17.047
I read your indictment
after I got your call last night

19:17.049 --> 19:18.948
and I bought your book.

19:18.950 --> 19:21.185
I'm only on page 112,
but, Molly, did you commit

19:21.187 --> 19:22.953
a felony and then write
a book about it?

19:22.955 --> 19:24.355
I haven't run a game
in over two years.

19:24.357 --> 19:25.589
Not to spoil the ending,
but that's

19:25.591 --> 19:26.756
when the government
raided my game

19:26.758 --> 19:28.391
<i>and took all my money assuming</i>

19:28.393 --> 19:30.927
all of it was made illegally,
which it wasn't.

19:30.929 --> 19:32.963
I've been living in my
mother's house in Telluride

19:32.965 --> 19:36.699
and... I wrote the book so I
could start paying off debts.

19:36.701 --> 19:38.702
<i>I just finished the press tour
for the book and I moved back</i>

19:38.704 --> 19:41.672
to Los Angeles
so I could start over.

19:41.674 --> 19:45.341
Hm. You ran games in L.A.
for roughly eight years?

19:45.343 --> 19:47.511
- Yeah. Right.
- Without taking a rake?

19:47.513 --> 19:49.346
And then you ran games
in New York for roughly two.

19:49.348 --> 19:51.483
Well, I took a rake
for the last six months.

19:51.485 --> 19:56.119
In the first 112 pages,
you name a bunch of names.

19:56.121 --> 19:57.454
- Sorry?
- Uh.

19:57.456 --> 19:58.688
You named the names
of some movie stars

19:58.690 --> 20:00.991
that played in your game.

20:00.993 --> 20:02.525
Yeah.

20:02.527 --> 20:04.730
That not against
some sort of poker code?

20:06.931 --> 20:08.465
Am I supposed to be sitting
all the way over here?

20:08.467 --> 20:10.303
- Can you hear me from there?
- Yeah.

20:11.937 --> 20:13.503
Are you taking me
on as a client?

20:13.505 --> 20:15.505
<i>My retainer is $250,000.</i>

20:15.507 --> 20:17.977
Do you have $250,000?

20:19.145 --> 20:21.645
No. I don't have anything.

20:21.647 --> 20:23.080
What about the sales
from your book?

20:23.082 --> 20:25.483
<i>The book isn't
jumping off the shelves.</i>

20:25.485 --> 20:27.485
But I will find a way
to pay you, Charlie.

20:27.487 --> 20:28.854
Ask around about me.

20:29.988 --> 20:31.722
Unfortunately,
the people I'd ask

20:31.724 --> 20:33.624
are goin' away for a while.

20:33.626 --> 20:36.526
What happened on Tuesday morning
was called a "GPS Takedown."

20:36.528 --> 20:38.795
Thirty-one people were arrested
in the same instant.

20:38.797 --> 20:41.330
Something in excess
of 600 agents were dispatched

20:41.332 --> 20:43.032
to locations
in New York and L.A.

20:43.034 --> 20:45.234
<i>in coordinated strikes
with automatic weapons.</i>

20:45.236 --> 20:47.472
And you're trying to tell me
you're in my office

20:47.474 --> 20:50.307
because you raked a game
of Texas Hold 'Em?

20:50.309 --> 20:52.542
Have you seen the other names
in your indictment?

20:52.544 --> 20:54.845
"Nicholas Kozlowski.
Peter Druzhinsky.

20:54.847 --> 20:56.612
Peter Antonovich.
The Gershen Brothers."

20:56.614 --> 20:58.115
I mean come on, Molly,
just how deep

20:58.117 --> 20:59.449
into the Russian mob were you?

20:59.451 --> 21:00.986
Because your book doesn't say.

21:17.570 --> 21:20.436
Why are you making your daughter
read "The Crucible?"

21:20.438 --> 21:21.871
So she can see
what happens to a group

21:21.873 --> 21:23.674
of bored teenage girls
when they gossip.

21:23.676 --> 21:25.375
- I never read the play.
- Many consider it to be...

21:25.377 --> 21:26.810
The best play
of the 20th century.

21:26.812 --> 21:28.011
Is that what
many consider it to be...

21:28.013 --> 21:30.513
I don't defend
violent criminals.

21:30.515 --> 21:32.616
- I've never hurt anyone...
- Your friends have.

21:32.618 --> 21:34.618
I've never heard of 90%
of the names...

21:34.620 --> 21:35.718
- On the indictment.
- And the other 10%?

21:35.720 --> 21:36.820
I didn't know they were
connected.

21:36.822 --> 21:38.054
I'd no idea
who they were.

21:38.056 --> 21:39.656
Let me ask you a question.

21:39.658 --> 21:42.626
The character in the book
you call "Dean Keith"

21:42.628 --> 21:45.462
he didn't say
"Poor people bagels," did he?

21:45.464 --> 21:46.830
<i>I think I know who he is.</i>

21:46.832 --> 21:47.997
<i>I think I know
a real estate lawyer</i>

21:47.999 --> 21:49.299
that worked with him
and quit.

21:49.301 --> 21:50.667
He said...

21:50.669 --> 21:52.104
"Nigger bagels," right?

21:58.110 --> 22:00.010
I'm not telling you his real
name. He's not involved in this.

22:00.012 --> 22:02.148
But you were willing
to name some names.

22:08.687 --> 22:10.320
Why is the FBI arresting me

22:10.322 --> 22:11.821
two years after
I stopped running games?

22:11.823 --> 22:13.991
Were you paid extra
in your book deal

22:13.993 --> 22:15.595
to name the movie stars?

22:18.997 --> 22:21.397
I'm not your guy, Molly.

22:21.399 --> 22:24.670
I wish you good luck,
but this just isn't for me.

22:34.480 --> 22:36.679
I didn't know
who the Russians were.

22:36.681 --> 22:39.081
<i>I can get you
the $250,000.</i>

22:39.083 --> 22:40.551
I left 10 times
that on the street.

22:40.553 --> 22:41.651
It'll just take some time.

22:41.653 --> 22:42.886
We regularly lend out our best

22:42.888 --> 22:45.188
litigators like me to the ACLU

22:45.190 --> 22:47.590
Southern Poverty Law Center,
veterans groups.

22:47.592 --> 22:49.827
But I don't think
I can convince my partners

22:49.829 --> 22:51.962
to take a flyer
on "The Poker Princess."

22:51.964 --> 22:53.763
I didn't name myself
"The Poker Princess."

22:53.765 --> 22:57.099
Uh, "Molly Bloom, the self
proclaimed Poker Princess..."

22:57.101 --> 22:58.268
Is that "Us Weekly?"

22:58.270 --> 22:59.903
Yeah, I would agree
it would be unusual

22:59.905 --> 23:01.839
for them to print
something that wasn't true.

23:01.841 --> 23:03.307
But it's not true,
and if you think

23:03.309 --> 23:06.009
a Princess can do what I did,
you're incorrect.

23:06.011 --> 23:07.578
<i>I'm getting you don't
think much of me.</i>

23:07.580 --> 23:09.580
But what if every one
of your ill-informed

23:09.582 --> 23:11.581
unsophisticated opinions
about me were wrong?

23:11.583 --> 23:12.916
- I'd be amazed.
- Yeah. You know what, bud?

23:12.918 --> 23:14.485
- You would.
- You don't need me.

23:14.487 --> 23:17.457
- You need a publicist.
- No, I need a fucking lawyer!

23:24.396 --> 23:26.032
You didn't answer my question.

23:28.833 --> 23:30.570
When was the last time
you slept?

23:33.572 --> 23:35.041
It was a while ago.

23:43.515 --> 23:45.282
Alright.

23:45.284 --> 23:46.949
I'm gonna walk you through
the arraignment this morning

23:46.951 --> 23:48.385
'cause you shouldn't
do that alone.

23:48.387 --> 23:50.353
I'm gonna put some bodies
on you and walk you

23:50.355 --> 23:52.388
through the side door,
'cause I don't know

23:52.390 --> 23:53.423
what you've got on the Russians.

23:53.425 --> 23:54.925
But neither do they.

23:54.927 --> 23:56.693
And the Russians
take care of shit.

23:56.695 --> 23:58.231
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

24:01.033 --> 24:02.101
Yes.

24:07.739 --> 24:10.706
Almost. You gotta keep
your eyes up, alright?

24:10.708 --> 24:12.242
Always gotta look ahead.

24:12.244 --> 24:13.276
If you look down

24:13.278 --> 24:14.513
that's where
you're gonna go.

24:16.348 --> 24:17.580
Alright?

24:17.582 --> 24:18.814
If you look down

24:18.816 --> 24:20.951
that's where you'll go,
alright?

24:20.953 --> 24:22.789
- Yeah.
- Alright.

24:25.457 --> 24:26.924
Let's go.

24:26.926 --> 24:28.425
<i>My father's a therapist</i>

24:28.427 --> 24:30.560
<i>and psychology professor
at Colorado State.</i>

24:30.562 --> 24:31.994
No! No!

24:31.996 --> 24:33.062
<i>The second rule of his house</i>

24:33.064 --> 24:34.630
<i>is that academic excellence</i>

24:34.632 --> 24:36.667
<i>and athletic excellence
weren't optional.</i>

24:36.669 --> 24:38.834
You can't be afraid of it,
alright?

24:38.836 --> 24:40.570
Don't play defense.

24:40.572 --> 24:41.705
<i>And the first rule</i>

24:41.707 --> 24:42.973
<i>was that he made all the rules.</i>

24:42.975 --> 24:43.840
Again.

24:43.842 --> 24:45.574
Dad, I'm pretty tired.

24:45.576 --> 24:47.610
Hon, she's tired.

24:47.612 --> 24:49.545
We've been out here
since 6 o'clock.

24:49.547 --> 24:51.016
<i>Her lips are blue.</i>

24:52.383 --> 24:54.019
- You're tired?
- Yeah.

24:57.288 --> 24:58.757
What's another word for tired?

25:00.793 --> 25:03.630
Name a synonym for tired
and we'll get in the car.

25:04.697 --> 25:06.163
Weak.

25:06.165 --> 25:07.830
That's right.

25:07.832 --> 25:09.067
Let's go home.

25:09.701 --> 25:11.901
Again.

25:11.903 --> 25:14.370
<i>I decided to postpone
law school another year.</i>

25:14.372 --> 25:16.540
<i>After six weeks of tips,
I went to Barneys</i>

25:16.542 --> 25:19.476
<i>and asked for a dress that made
me look nothing like myself.</i>

25:19.478 --> 25:21.410
<i>I'd overheard stories
about games that folded</i>

25:21.412 --> 25:24.880
<i>after one bad night and I
needed this one to keep going.</i>

25:24.882 --> 25:27.283
<i>And I needed to bring
value to it.</i>

25:27.285 --> 25:29.453
<i>I knew if I
wanted to cement my place</i>

25:29.455 --> 25:31.320
<i>there was one guy I needed
to team up with.</i>

25:31.322 --> 25:32.489
Ten thousand.

25:32.491 --> 25:34.157
<i>And that was this man.</i>

25:34.159 --> 25:36.592
<i>The game had regulars
and the game had guests.</i>

25:36.594 --> 25:38.861
<i>And four of the regulars
were famous actors.</i>

25:38.863 --> 25:40.797
<i>And I'm gonna call one of them
Player X.</i>

25:40.799 --> 25:42.064
I'm all in.

25:42.066 --> 25:43.132
<i>Player X subscribed</i>

25:43.134 --> 25:44.701
<i>to the belief that money won</i>

25:44.703 --> 25:46.203
<i>was twice as good
as money earned.</i>

25:46.205 --> 25:48.905
<i>He lived to beat people
and take their money.</i>

25:48.907 --> 25:50.639
<i>Here's Player X
talking to one of the guests</i>

25:50.641 --> 25:51.907
<i>into folding the winning hand.</i>

25:51.909 --> 25:54.276
I swear on... look at me.

25:54.278 --> 25:56.682
I swear on my mother's life,
I have you.

25:59.418 --> 26:02.819
<i>Player X was the best
player at the table, and tonight...</i>

26:02.821 --> 26:04.290
<i>this guy was the worst.</i>

26:08.026 --> 26:09.592
<i>He's staring at his cards.</i>

26:09.594 --> 26:11.194
<i>Even a reasonably good amateur</i>

26:11.196 --> 26:13.429
<i>would know it was
mathematically the best hand.</i>

26:13.431 --> 26:15.665
<i>Which in poker
is called "The Nuts."</i>

26:15.667 --> 26:17.434
<i>There was $47,000 in the pot</i>

26:17.436 --> 26:19.069
<i>and the guest
was holding the nuts.</i>

26:19.071 --> 26:20.536
<i>But he was starting
to get confused</i>

26:20.538 --> 26:22.205
<i>because a movie star
was talking to him.</i>

26:22.207 --> 26:24.374
My mother's life man,
I'm not messing with you.

26:24.376 --> 26:25.408
Why would you be telling me?

26:25.410 --> 26:26.609
Either I am messing with you

26:26.611 --> 26:27.711
or you're new to the game.

26:27.713 --> 26:28.945
You've had bad cards all night.

26:28.947 --> 26:30.813
You should've folded
after the flop

26:30.815 --> 26:32.448
and I don't wanna win
more of your money this way.

26:32.450 --> 26:33.752
I've got queens under here.

26:35.120 --> 26:36.255
Take your time.

26:49.668 --> 26:51.801
- <i>Fold.</i>
- Fuck you.

26:51.803 --> 26:53.837
- No!
- Oh.

27:01.080 --> 27:03.813
<i>A fish is a
particular kind of player.</i>

27:03.815 --> 27:05.415
<i>A fish has money.</i>

27:05.417 --> 27:08.018
<i>A fish plays loose
and doesn't fold a lot.</i>

27:08.020 --> 27:10.820
<i>A fish is good...
but not too good.</i>

27:10.822 --> 27:12.254
There's an ATM in the hall, bro.

27:12.256 --> 27:13.491
<i>The Cobra Lounge may belong</i>

27:13.493 --> 27:14.925
<i>to Dean Keith.</i>

27:14.927 --> 27:16.426
<i>But the game belonged
to Player X.</i>

27:16.428 --> 27:18.160
<i>People wanted to say
they played with him.</i>

27:18.162 --> 27:19.495
<i>The same way they wanted to say</i>

27:19.497 --> 27:21.063
<i>they rode on Air Force One.</i>

27:21.065 --> 27:22.698
<i>My job security
was gonna depend</i>

27:22.700 --> 27:24.333
<i>on bringing him his fish.</i>

27:24.335 --> 27:26.035
<i>But where would I find people
with a lot of money</i>

27:26.037 --> 27:27.436
<i>who didn't know how to spend it</i>

27:27.438 --> 27:29.039
<i>and liked to be
around celebrities?</i>

27:29.041 --> 27:30.773
If they say
they're interested in poker

27:30.775 --> 27:33.042
you give 'em my number,
I vet them.

27:33.044 --> 27:34.610
They end up playing in a game...

27:34.612 --> 27:37.613
I'll give you a $1000
the first time they play.

27:37.615 --> 27:39.916
Five hundred every time
after that.

27:39.918 --> 27:42.486
Be sure to mention
these guys are all regulars.

27:42.488 --> 27:43.720
Is this true?

27:43.722 --> 27:44.957
These guys play?

27:46.891 --> 27:50.060
<i>The Commerce Casino is
off the 5 freeway in East L.A.</i>

27:50.062 --> 27:53.096
<i>And no one's ever gonna confuse
it with Monte Carlo.</i>

27:53.098 --> 27:54.697
<i>I'd watch the tables
for a while</i>

27:54.699 --> 27:56.765
<i>before I approached
a friendly-looking pit boss.</i>

27:56.767 --> 27:59.602
Third chair
at table eight can't lose.

27:59.604 --> 28:02.672
Unless there are players
at his table who can win.

28:02.674 --> 28:05.308
You know about the game
at the Cobra Lounge, right?

28:05.310 --> 28:06.342
Sure.

28:06.344 --> 28:08.778
One thousand for every player
you send me.

28:08.780 --> 28:10.780
You get a piece
of what they lose.

28:10.782 --> 28:12.282
No pros.

28:12.284 --> 28:14.317
I'm Molly.

28:14.319 --> 28:15.918
<i>Poker was my Trojan horse</i>

28:15.920 --> 28:18.754
<i>into the highest level
of finance, technology</i>

28:18.756 --> 28:20.624
<i>politics, entertainment, art.</i>

28:20.626 --> 28:22.158
<i>All I had to do was listen.</i>

28:22.160 --> 28:24.127
The art world is controlled
by a few major dealers.

28:24.129 --> 28:26.362
China's Telecom companies wanna
partner with other providers.

28:26.364 --> 28:28.063
The owners don't mind
spending $30 million

28:28.065 --> 28:30.567
on an outfielder
that hits 320 with 110 RBI.

28:30.569 --> 28:31.901
They alone control the market.

28:31.903 --> 28:34.271
They chose the artist
they wanna be important.

28:34.273 --> 28:35.738
They don't mind
spending $10 million

28:35.740 --> 28:37.974
on a pitcher
who is 8-14 this season.

28:37.976 --> 28:39.576
- It's gonna be Gephardt.
- They set the prices.

28:39.578 --> 28:42.479
They even mark 'em up,
70, 80, 90 percent.

28:42.481 --> 28:45.282
They're all very excited
about a company called Twitter.

28:45.284 --> 28:47.617
Unregulated money.
Usually all cash. Unreported.

28:47.619 --> 28:49.418
- His days are numbered.
- His days are numbered.

28:49.420 --> 28:50.786
I don't know how much longer
she's gonna be in that job.

28:50.788 --> 28:51.820
- She's done.
- She's gone.

28:51.822 --> 28:53.255
All in.

28:53.257 --> 28:54.291
<i>People have asked me what</i>

28:54.293 --> 28:55.692
<i>my goal was at that point.</i>

28:55.694 --> 28:57.327
<i>What was my end game?</i>

28:57.329 --> 28:59.862
<i>Back then, I would have
laughed at that question.</i>

28:59.864 --> 29:01.630
<i>I was raised to be a champion.</i>

29:01.632 --> 29:03.166
<i>My goal was to win.</i>

29:03.168 --> 29:04.967
<i>At what and against whom?</i>

29:04.969 --> 29:07.369
- <i>Those were just details.</i>
- I'm all in.

29:07.371 --> 29:08.672
<i>I had my own apartment now.</i>

29:08.674 --> 29:09.805
I'll take it.

29:09.807 --> 29:11.840
<i>A new car...</i>

29:11.842 --> 29:14.109
<i>and $17,000 in a shoebox.</i>

29:14.111 --> 29:16.082
<i>Law school could wait
one more year.</i>

29:18.050 --> 29:21.350
<i>Next, please. Come on through.</i>

29:21.352 --> 29:25.222
<i>Step on up please. Thank you.
Come on through.</i>

29:25.224 --> 29:27.823
So. Here's all that's
gonna happen today.

29:27.825 --> 29:29.259
Judge is gonna ask
each defendant

29:29.261 --> 29:30.560
if they've read the indictment

29:30.562 --> 29:32.795
or they'd like the court
to read it to them.

29:32.797 --> 29:35.130
Then the judge is gonna ask
how you plead.

29:35.132 --> 29:37.167
You're gonna answer,
"Not guilty."

29:37.169 --> 29:38.601
I'll make it clear
for the record

29:38.603 --> 29:39.668
that I'm not your counsel

29:39.670 --> 29:40.936
but I am appearing
on your behalf

29:40.938 --> 29:42.004
at the arraignment.

29:42.006 --> 29:43.540
<i>In propria persona.</i>

29:43.542 --> 29:45.841
<i>In propria persona</i>
means on your behalf.

29:45.843 --> 29:47.109
- Yeah.
- No.

29:47.111 --> 29:48.744
I'm saying it means
on your behalf.

29:48.746 --> 29:49.945
I am appearing on your behalf.

29:49.947 --> 29:50.981
<i>In propria persona means</i>

29:50.983 --> 29:52.514
you're appearing on your behalf.

29:52.516 --> 29:53.852
Not my behalf.

29:55.454 --> 29:57.954
I'll check that out,
but the point is...

29:57.956 --> 29:59.321
I'm not your lawyer.

29:59.323 --> 30:01.326
And I'll make that clear
for the record.

30:19.945 --> 30:22.012
That's us over there.

30:22.014 --> 30:23.713
You know, why don't you
sit there?

30:23.715 --> 30:25.217
And you sit on the other side.

30:32.323 --> 30:35.324
You've gotta good judge.
He's a good guy.

30:35.326 --> 30:38.194
- <i>Counsel, please...</i>
- How about the prosecutor?

30:38.196 --> 30:40.030
<i>Good morning, Your
Honor, Harrison Wellstone</i>

30:40.032 --> 30:42.432
<i>Assistant U.S. Attorney
for the Southern District</i>

30:42.434 --> 30:44.734
<i>joined at counsel table
by Assistant U.S. Attorney</i>

30:44.736 --> 30:48.905
<i>Eric Brennan and FBI
Special Agent Deborah D'Angelo.</i>

30:48.907 --> 30:50.372
Thank you.

30:50.374 --> 30:52.574
<i>Are there any oral motions
at this time?</i>

30:52.576 --> 30:54.010
Switch with me.

30:56.180 --> 30:58.348
<i>On behalf of the defendant...</i>

30:58.350 --> 31:01.117
Just in case your lawyer
doesn't mention it

31:01.119 --> 31:02.452
next time you appear
in front of the judge

31:02.454 --> 31:05.422
you might wanna re-think
your clothes. Okay?

31:05.424 --> 31:07.494
You look like the Cinemax
version of yourself.

31:08.959 --> 31:10.926
I sold my clothes
when the government seized

31:10.928 --> 31:12.595
all of my money two years ago.

31:12.597 --> 31:15.165
Which, incidentally,
was the last time I ran a game.

31:15.167 --> 31:17.766
But I think
I already mentioned that.

31:17.768 --> 31:19.336
- Okay.
- <i>Not guilty.</i>

31:19.338 --> 31:20.736
<i>- Thank you, you may be seated.
- Hey. Switch back.</i>

31:20.738 --> 31:24.475
Defendant number two.
Nicholas Segel.

31:24.477 --> 31:26.943
Has the defendant seen
a copy of the indictment?

31:26.945 --> 31:28.278
<i>Yes, Your Honor.</i>

31:28.280 --> 31:29.779
Have you discussed it
with your lawyer?

31:29.781 --> 31:31.414
<i>Yes.</i>

31:31.416 --> 31:32.415
Switch back.

31:32.417 --> 31:33.917
<i>Yes.</i>

31:33.919 --> 31:36.552
<i>- And how do you plead?
- Not guilty.</i>

31:36.554 --> 31:38.620
Thank you,
you may have your seat.

31:38.622 --> 31:40.122
Your old boss.

31:40.124 --> 31:42.257
The one in the book
you called Dean Keith.

31:42.259 --> 31:43.827
He was terrible to you.

31:43.829 --> 31:45.794
Why cover up for him
by changing it

31:45.796 --> 31:47.429
to "poor people bagels?"

31:47.431 --> 31:50.032
I promise you
it couldn't matter less.

31:50.034 --> 31:52.569
<i>Has the defendant seen
a copy of the indictment?</i>

31:52.571 --> 31:55.871
- Just making conversation.
- <i>Yes, your honor.</i>

31:55.873 --> 31:58.174
- Hey, switch back.
- <i>Discussed with your lawyer?</i>

31:58.176 --> 32:01.211
<i>- I have.
- How do you plead this time?</i>

32:01.213 --> 32:02.579
<i>Not guilty.</i>

32:02.581 --> 32:04.347
<i>Have a seat.</i>

32:04.349 --> 32:07.282
Defendant number four.
Molly Bloom.

32:13.824 --> 32:16.393
Good morning, Your Honor.
Uh, Charles Jaffey

32:16.395 --> 32:19.065
for the defendant,
just for the purposes...

32:26.103 --> 32:28.937
Well, it's good to see you,
Mr. Jaffey.

32:28.939 --> 32:30.409
Are you with us this morning?

32:33.210 --> 32:35.244
Mr. Jaffey?

32:35.246 --> 32:38.580
Uh, yes, sir.
Just, uh, one moment.

32:38.582 --> 32:42.318
- Switch back.
- Seriously?

32:42.320 --> 32:44.620
You said you left ten times
that much on the street.

32:44.622 --> 32:48.590
In my office, when I said
the retainer was $250,000

32:48.592 --> 32:50.894
you said,
"I left ten times that much..."

32:50.896 --> 32:52.262
Yeah.

32:52.264 --> 32:54.563
Counsel! I need to record
your appearance.

32:54.565 --> 32:58.400
If it please the court,
Your Honor, Just one moment.

32:58.402 --> 33:00.669
You're extended credit,
you're destitute

33:00.671 --> 33:02.906
and you leave two and a half
million dollars on the street?

33:02.908 --> 33:04.440
I had to.

33:04.442 --> 33:05.908
<i>Didn't anyone try
to buy your debt sheet?</i>

33:05.910 --> 33:08.278
Everyone tried to buy my debt
sheet. Is this...

33:08.280 --> 33:10.847
Why didn't you sell it like
you sold your clothes?

33:10.849 --> 33:13.649
- I couldn't.
- Why?

33:13.651 --> 33:16.322
I couldn't be sure
how they were gonna collect.

33:19.591 --> 33:21.726
I was afraid
you were gonna say that.

33:26.931 --> 33:28.097
Counsel!

33:29.700 --> 33:30.699
Yes, your Honor. Uh...

33:30.701 --> 33:32.268
Charles Jaffey
for the defendant.

33:32.270 --> 33:33.735
For the purposes
of this hearing only?

33:33.737 --> 33:36.138
No, sir.
I am Molly Bloom's attorney.

33:36.140 --> 33:38.541
Uh, she's read the indictment,
discussed it with her lawyer.

33:38.543 --> 33:40.176
Waives the right
to have it read to her

33:40.178 --> 33:42.911
and pleads "Not guilty."

33:42.913 --> 33:44.880
Thank you, you may be seated.

33:44.882 --> 33:47.649
<i>Defendant number five!
Ilian Gershen!</i>

33:47.651 --> 33:49.686
<i>Good morning, Your Honor.</i>

33:49.688 --> 33:51.288
I'm gonna have to keep
reading your book.

33:54.024 --> 33:56.225
<i>There was a track
star of the 1930's</i>

33:56.227 --> 33:58.360
<i>named Matthew Robinson.</i>

33:58.362 --> 34:00.295
<i>Matthew Robinson shattered
the Olympic record</i>

34:00.297 --> 34:03.933
<i>in the 200
at the Berlin Games in 1936.</i>

34:03.935 --> 34:07.436
<i>Absolutely shattered
the Olympic record...</i>

34:07.438 --> 34:08.937
<i>and came in second.</i>

34:08.938 --> 34:11.840
<i>The man who came in first
was Jesse Owens.</i>

34:11.842 --> 34:13.909
<i>Jesse Owens went on
to be a legend.</i>

34:13.911 --> 34:16.110
<i>Matthew Robinson
went on to be a janitor</i>

34:16.112 --> 34:18.482
<i>at a whites-only
middle school in Pasadena.</i>

34:18.484 --> 34:21.583
<i>The difference
was 4/10 of a second.</i>

34:21.585 --> 34:22.985
<i>As if that wasn't enough</i>

34:22.987 --> 34:24.454
<i>Matthew Robinson
had a little brother</i>

34:24.456 --> 34:25.487
<i>who was also an athlete.</i>

34:25.489 --> 34:27.592
<i>His name was Jackie.</i>

34:28.525 --> 34:29.591
<i>I have two younger brothers</i>

34:29.592 --> 34:31.426
<i>who are overachievers as well.</i>

34:31.428 --> 34:33.862
<i>While I was ranked third
in North America</i>

34:33.864 --> 34:36.699
<i>my brother Jeremy
was number one in the world.</i>

34:36.701 --> 34:40.168
<i>And while I was placing into
AP Chemistry as a sophomore</i>

34:40.170 --> 34:41.603
<i>my brother Jordan was doing it</i>

34:41.605 --> 34:42.971
<i>when he was 12-years-old
or something.</i>

34:42.973 --> 34:44.507
<i>I don't know.</i>

34:44.509 --> 34:46.708
<i>I was a hot shot student
and a hot shot skier</i>

34:46.710 --> 34:48.744
<i>everywhere but my own house.</i>

34:48.746 --> 34:51.848
<i>As I got older, I began
to bait my father into fights</i>

34:51.850 --> 34:53.583
<i>without really knowing
why I was doing it.</i>

34:53.585 --> 34:55.654
What did everyone
learn in school today?

35:00.692 --> 35:03.192
Uh... I learned
that Sigmund Freud

35:03.194 --> 35:04.726
was both a misogynist
and an idiot.

35:04.728 --> 35:06.663
And anyone who relies
on his theories

35:06.665 --> 35:08.297
of human psychology is a quack.

35:08.299 --> 35:09.598
I don't know why you'd say that.

35:09.600 --> 35:11.668
You asked me what I
learned in school today.

35:11.670 --> 35:13.438
- Is this Mrs. Linwood?
- <i>Yup.</i>

35:14.538 --> 35:16.205
Did she happen
to mention anything

35:16.207 --> 35:18.174
about his work
on the unconscious mind?

35:18.176 --> 35:21.076
His dream analysis has
the credibility of a horoscope.

35:21.078 --> 35:22.679
But what got my attention

35:22.681 --> 35:24.980
was that he opposed the women's
emancipation movement.

35:24.982 --> 35:26.248
<i>He believed that a woman's life</i>

35:26.250 --> 35:27.616
is about her
reproductive functions.

35:27.618 --> 35:29.252
So you're really getting
to the nuts and bolts

35:29.254 --> 35:30.486
of why middle-class
suburban white girls

35:30.488 --> 35:31.654
have been oppressed
for centuries.

35:31.656 --> 35:32.855
No, Mrs. Linwood was just...

35:32.857 --> 35:36.192
Barbara Linwood
doesn't like men, Molly.

35:36.194 --> 35:38.594
She doesn't like dicks,
dad, there's a difference.

35:38.596 --> 35:39.864
Molly...

35:43.969 --> 35:45.634
Don't disrespect me
like that at the table.

35:45.636 --> 35:46.668
I wasn't disrespecting you.

35:46.670 --> 35:48.438
I was disrespecting Freud.

35:48.440 --> 35:49.739
And it's the kitchen table

35:49.741 --> 35:51.306
not the tomb
of the unknown soldier.

35:51.308 --> 35:53.576
And I'm a professional
psychologist, not a quack.

35:53.578 --> 35:55.011
- I never said you were...
- Yeah, you did.

35:55.013 --> 35:56.348
And don't do it again.

35:59.350 --> 36:01.049
And don't ever use language
like that again.

36:01.051 --> 36:03.719
Okay. Ignore my teachers,
watch my language

36:03.721 --> 36:05.420
and respect the kitchen table.

36:05.422 --> 36:06.656
What else do I
need to do before

36:06.658 --> 36:08.056
I'm allowed
to disagree with you?

36:08.058 --> 36:09.324
Make your own money

36:09.326 --> 36:12.027
so you can live
in your own house...

36:12.029 --> 36:13.498
and eat your own food.

36:16.400 --> 36:18.467
<i>I'd been running
the game for three years</i>

36:18.469 --> 36:21.136
<i>and saved $58,000.</i>

36:21.138 --> 36:22.772
<i>I was recruiting
and vetting players.</i>

36:22.774 --> 36:24.172
- <i>Keeping the books.</i>
- Call.

36:24.174 --> 36:25.641
<i>Collecting
and delivering checks.</i>

36:25.643 --> 36:27.076
<i>Meeting the needs
of all the players</i>

36:27.078 --> 36:28.511
<i>through out the week
and still working</i>

36:28.513 --> 36:30.078
<i>full time for Dean Keith.</i>

36:30.080 --> 36:32.348
<i>Who made it clear that
if I quit the office job</i>

36:32.350 --> 36:33.415
<i>I'd lose the game.</i>

36:33.417 --> 36:35.083
- Call.
- Eights, full of nines.

36:45.496 --> 36:46.895
I thought he had trips too.

36:46.897 --> 36:48.531
<i>He was slow-playing
into the river</i>

36:48.533 --> 36:50.500
and he hid the pocket eights
pretty well.

36:50.502 --> 36:52.235
It's a tough beat, man.

36:52.237 --> 36:54.673
- You owe the game...
- I know what I owe the game!

36:57.641 --> 36:58.741
I wanna talk to you a minute.

36:58.743 --> 37:00.208
- Okay.
- In the hall.

37:00.210 --> 37:03.479
<i>♪ It came from heartache ♪</i>

37:03.481 --> 37:06.081
<i>♪ Then it died ♪</i>

37:06.083 --> 37:08.987
<i>♪ From the street... ♪♪</i>

37:11.188 --> 37:12.524
Is he cheating?

37:13.658 --> 37:14.623
No.

37:14.625 --> 37:16.926
- How would you know?
- I'd know.

37:16.928 --> 37:18.261
He and Diego
aren't in bed together?

37:18.263 --> 37:19.565
No.

37:20.431 --> 37:22.498
What about him and you?

37:22.500 --> 37:23.965
A 52 card deck produces

37:23.967 --> 37:26.502
hundreds of millions
of random patterns.

37:26.504 --> 37:28.804
But every time one of you loses
two weeks in a row

37:28.806 --> 37:30.306
you're sure something fishy
is going on?

37:30.308 --> 37:31.543
Come on.

37:34.446 --> 37:36.746
I'm gonna stop paying you.

37:36.748 --> 37:40.049
- What do you mean?
- As my assistant.

37:40.051 --> 37:41.485
- Are you firing me?
- I'm not firing you.

37:41.487 --> 37:42.652
I'm just gonna stop paying you.

37:42.654 --> 37:44.020
You get paid once a week
from the game.

37:44.022 --> 37:45.420
It doesn't seem fair.

37:45.422 --> 37:46.822
But I also have a job working
for you 24 hours...

37:46.824 --> 37:48.824
And if you didn't have a job

37:48.826 --> 37:50.993
you wouldn't have the game.
You understand what I'm saying?

37:50.995 --> 37:52.994
I understand each of the words
that you're saying but I don't...

37:52.996 --> 37:55.732
- Look!
- 24 hours a day, every day.

37:55.734 --> 37:57.165
But you're gonna stop paying me
to do that job

37:57.167 --> 37:59.402
because I'm making too much
money doing my second job?

37:59.404 --> 38:01.170
And if I say no,
I'll lose both jobs?

38:01.172 --> 38:02.404
Because it doesn't seem fair?

38:02.406 --> 38:04.507
Business is bad right now.

38:04.509 --> 38:05.911
Welcome to the real world.

38:07.846 --> 38:10.513
Alright, here it is.
Banks are loaning you money.

38:10.515 --> 38:11.848
And they shouldn't.

38:11.850 --> 38:13.449
You're a bad risk, they know it.

38:13.451 --> 38:14.917
So the debt service
on your loans

38:14.919 --> 38:17.353
is close to 20%,
which is crazy.

38:17.355 --> 38:19.355
Twenty percent is
barely survivable

38:19.357 --> 38:20.757
if it's a bridge loan.

38:20.759 --> 38:22.391
But, like for instance

38:22.393 --> 38:25.527
it's taken you 10 years
to build seven houses.

38:25.529 --> 38:27.496
All of which are worth
less than they were

38:27.498 --> 38:29.565
before you built them,
because the housing market

38:29.567 --> 38:31.734
is on a downward trajectory
for the first time

38:31.736 --> 38:32.902
in the history of houses.

38:32.904 --> 38:35.472
And that's why business
is doing bad.

38:35.474 --> 38:38.174
Not because you're paying me
$450 a week.

38:38.176 --> 38:39.475
You're a business savant?

38:39.477 --> 38:40.942
I've read every piece of paper
in your office.

38:40.944 --> 38:42.645
You're making thousands
in tips every week.

38:42.647 --> 38:44.179
Why do you care about $450?

38:44.181 --> 38:45.982
Because I don't want to pick up
your dry cleaning for free!

38:45.984 --> 38:49.317
Well, you don't have
bargaining power here!

38:49.319 --> 38:51.890
You can refuse the pay cut
but you could lose the game.

38:53.924 --> 38:55.393
Cash me out, please.

38:57.094 --> 38:58.527
<i>I wasn't gonna wait for Dean</i>

38:58.529 --> 38:59.728
<i>to take the game away from me</i>

38:59.730 --> 39:02.098
<i>before I put a plan in place.</i>

39:02.100 --> 39:03.665
<i>The next morning,
I made appointments</i>

39:03.667 --> 39:05.467
<i>at the Four Seasons,
The Peninsula</i>

39:05.469 --> 39:07.071
<i>and the Beverly Hills Hotel.</i>

39:08.205 --> 39:11.339
<i>The suite was $5200 a night.</i>

39:11.341 --> 39:13.009
<i>I spent $17,000</i>

39:13.011 --> 39:15.677
<i>on a shuffle master that was
installed in the table.</i>

39:15.679 --> 39:17.712
<i>Faster, more reliable shuffles.</i>

39:17.714 --> 39:19.248
<i>Less downtime between hands.</i>

39:19.250 --> 39:20.917
<i>Food was brought in
from Mr. Chow</i>

39:20.919 --> 39:23.319
<i>and available to eat
on the side tables.</i>

39:23.321 --> 39:24.654
<i>There was Macallan 18</i>

39:24.656 --> 39:26.656
<i>Belvedere, 1942</i>

39:26.658 --> 39:29.090
<i>Remy Martin,
and a '88 Lafite Rothschild</i>

39:29.092 --> 39:32.094
<i>served by a bartender who'd
already memorized your drink.</i>

39:32.096 --> 39:35.130
<i>Cohibas and Monte Cristo
were in the humidor.</i>

39:35.132 --> 39:36.898
<i>A professional stylist
turned me</i>

39:36.900 --> 39:38.734
<i>into what my defense attorney
would later call</i>

39:38.736 --> 39:41.270
<i>"The Cinemax version
of myself."</i>

39:41.272 --> 39:43.572
<i>I spent almost everything
I had in preparation</i>

39:43.574 --> 39:45.040
<i>for the phone call
I knew was coming.</i>

39:51.181 --> 39:52.915
- Hello.
- <i>I want you to listen to me.</i>

39:52.917 --> 39:54.851
- <i>'Cause you need to hear this.</i>
- Where are you?

39:54.853 --> 39:57.085
<i>I need to tell you something
in plain English</i>

39:57.087 --> 39:58.654
<i>and I need to know
that you understood it.</i>

39:58.656 --> 40:01.190
- Dean.
- <i>You are unimportant.</i>

40:01.192 --> 40:02.625
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

40:02.627 --> 40:04.694
<i>And you are fired.</i>

40:04.696 --> 40:05.994
<i>The job, the game...</i>

40:05.996 --> 40:07.996
- <i>You're fired.</i>
- Can I ask why?

40:07.998 --> 40:09.998
<i>How many of my friends
are you sleeping with?</i>

40:10.000 --> 40:11.299
I'm not sleeping
with any of 'em.

40:11.301 --> 40:12.768
<i>That's not what I heard.</i>

40:12.770 --> 40:15.404
Listen to me.
With a HAZMAT suit, I wouldn't...

40:15.406 --> 40:17.074
<i>Can I give you some advice?</i>

40:18.275 --> 40:19.708
<i>Lose the bitchy air.</i>

40:19.710 --> 40:22.011
<i>Lose the superior air.</i>

40:22.013 --> 40:23.645
<i>And go to the office
and get your stuff</i>

40:23.647 --> 40:25.484
<i>and be out of there
before I show up.</i>

40:26.350 --> 40:27.785
Hey, are you Molly?

40:28.453 --> 40:29.552
Yeah.

40:29.554 --> 40:30.953
I'm Leah, um...

40:30.955 --> 40:33.022
Dean asked me
to pack your personals.

40:33.024 --> 40:34.056
I appreciate it.

40:34.058 --> 40:36.058
He also asked me
to get the numbers

40:36.060 --> 40:39.427
of tonight's players
so I can confirm the list.

40:39.429 --> 40:41.230
<i>I'm really sorry.</i>

40:41.232 --> 40:42.233
Don't be.

40:44.067 --> 40:45.567
My phone's in my car.

40:45.569 --> 40:46.802
Uh, I'll text you
all the numbers

40:46.804 --> 40:48.436
you need when I get downstairs.

40:48.438 --> 40:50.873
<i>I texted my replacement
a bunch of random numbers</i>

40:50.875 --> 40:52.241
<i>with 310 area codes.</i>

40:52.243 --> 40:53.342
<i>Then I sent a text</i>

40:53.344 --> 40:54.643
<i>to the players for tonight</i>

40:54.645 --> 40:56.145
<i>and told them
the game had been moved</i>

40:56.147 --> 40:59.882
<i>to the Four Seasons Hotel,
Suite 1401.</i>

40:59.884 --> 41:02.918
- Hey, how you doing?
- Drink?

41:02.920 --> 41:04.420
- Thank you very much.
- <i>Do you a part...</i>

41:04.422 --> 41:05.654
<i>I'd love to.</i>

41:05.656 --> 41:07.924
Yeah?
So this guy's producing it.

41:07.926 --> 41:09.458
You should, uh, come down.

41:09.460 --> 41:11.994
- Amazing.
- Yeah, it'll be fun.

41:24.908 --> 41:27.078
Fellas, can I have your
attention for a moment?

41:33.518 --> 41:34.686
Where's Dean?

41:36.386 --> 41:39.721
I'll be hosting a game in this
suite every Tuesday night.

41:39.723 --> 41:42.792
If you play tonight, you'll be
guaranteed a chair for a year.

41:42.794 --> 41:45.728
If you prefer to play
at the Cobra Lounge...

41:45.730 --> 41:47.866
there'll be no hard feelings.

41:53.737 --> 41:55.036
Let's play.

41:55.038 --> 41:56.605
<i>The game is mine now.</i>

41:56.607 --> 41:59.976
<i>I incorporated and Molly Bloom
Event Planning was born.</i>

41:59.978 --> 42:02.944
<i>I paid taxes and 1099'd
my employees.</i>

42:02.946 --> 42:05.348
<i>I never became romantically
or sexually involved</i>

42:05.350 --> 42:06.715
<i>with any of the players.</i>

42:06.717 --> 42:08.384
<i>The game would have
fallen apart.</i>

42:08.386 --> 42:11.219
<i>This was back when I was
still making good decisions.</i>

42:11.221 --> 42:12.922
<i>And I went to a lawyer
to make absolutely sure</i>

42:12.924 --> 42:14.723
<i>all this was legal.</i>

42:14.725 --> 42:16.257
<i>- Are you taking a rake?
- No.</i>

42:16.259 --> 42:18.127
Then you're not
breaking the law.

42:18.129 --> 42:19.862
- But can I give you advice?
- Please.

42:19.864 --> 42:21.364
<i>There's a saying
in my business.</i>

42:21.366 --> 42:24.232
Don't break the law
when you're breaking the law.

42:24.234 --> 42:26.569
- What do you mean?
- No drugs. No prostitutes.

42:26.571 --> 42:27.969
No muscle to collect debts.

42:27.971 --> 42:29.505
Oh, I don't do
anything like that.

42:29.507 --> 42:31.540
But you just said
I wasn't breaking the law.

42:31.542 --> 42:33.576
You wanna keep it that way
because you don't wanna

42:33.578 --> 42:35.259
break the law when
you're breaking the law.

42:36.346 --> 42:38.147
Am I breaking the law?

42:38.149 --> 42:39.315
Not really.

42:39.317 --> 42:41.417
We're able to find out
for sure, aren't we?

42:41.419 --> 42:42.685
Laws are written down.

42:42.687 --> 42:44.420
You're not taking
a percentage of the pot?

42:44.422 --> 42:45.621
No.

42:45.623 --> 42:48.190
You're running a square game.

42:48.192 --> 42:50.494
<i>My game had a tricky ecosystem.</i>

42:50.495 --> 42:52.027
<i>These guys could buy anything.</i>

42:52.029 --> 42:53.529
<i>But here, in this room</i>

42:53.531 --> 42:55.130
<i>you couldn't buy your win.</i>

42:55.132 --> 42:57.599
<i>You couldn't buy me,
you couldn't buy the girls.</i>

42:57.601 --> 43:00.002
<i>And you couldn't buy
a seat at the table.</i>

43:00.004 --> 43:02.638
<i>There's nothing as sweet
as a win you have to work for.</i>

43:02.640 --> 43:06.409
<i>And the wins and loses were
compelling, and they were real.</i>

43:06.411 --> 43:08.677
<i>Of course, it helped that the
players were gambling addicts.</i>

43:08.679 --> 43:10.148
Can I see you for a second?

43:16.020 --> 43:17.619
<i>Jay, you're famous.</i>

43:17.621 --> 43:19.654
You are an international
rock star.

43:19.656 --> 43:21.690
Oh, I wasn't sure
you'd noticed.

43:21.692 --> 43:23.292
You can't send
emails like that.

43:23.294 --> 43:25.393
Well, it's not a federal
production, okay?

43:25.395 --> 43:28.163
I just invited you to Cabo
for the weekend.

43:28.165 --> 43:30.532
The next woman you send
an email like that to

43:30.534 --> 43:31.634
is not gonna be me.

43:31.636 --> 43:33.402
It's going to be someone else.

43:33.404 --> 43:34.603
You're playing with fire.

43:34.605 --> 43:36.371
I'm telling you that
I'm in love with you

43:36.373 --> 43:38.873
and you are worried about me
getting blackmailed?

43:38.875 --> 43:41.009
Oh, my, that just makes me
more into you.

43:41.011 --> 43:43.746
Lemon head. They won't need
to blackmail you.

43:43.748 --> 43:46.181
They can get just as
much money from TMZ.

43:46.183 --> 43:48.284
And TMZ will give them
what they really want.

43:48.286 --> 43:49.918
Tell me the truth.
Was mine the first love letter

43:49.920 --> 43:50.953
you've gotten from a player?

43:50.955 --> 43:52.420
It was the seventh.

43:52.422 --> 43:53.855
All digitally transmitted.

43:53.857 --> 43:55.690
You are begging for
your life to be turned

43:55.692 --> 43:57.726
into a very public hell.

43:57.728 --> 43:59.094
So that's a no on Cabo?

43:59.096 --> 44:00.895
Why don't you just give your
wife and kids a break

44:00.897 --> 44:02.297
and run 'em over with a limo?

44:02.299 --> 44:04.232
I love the way that
you talk to me.

44:04.234 --> 44:05.235
Oh, God.

44:11.074 --> 44:12.907
- I've had a thought.
- Yeah?

44:12.909 --> 44:14.145
Raise the stakes.

44:17.047 --> 44:18.049
To what?

44:19.250 --> 44:22.254
50k buy-in. Blinds are 250/500.

44:25.388 --> 44:27.725
- That's a 500 percent hike.
- Yeah.

44:29.092 --> 44:30.494
I don't think it's a good idea.

44:30.495 --> 44:32.256
Could you guys give me
the room for a second?

44:34.265 --> 44:35.266
Sure.

44:40.404 --> 44:41.904
The players that are losing
a $100,000 a week

44:41.906 --> 44:43.304
are gonna be losing
half a million.

44:43.306 --> 44:44.839
The players winning
a $100,000 a week...

44:44.841 --> 44:46.674
Will have no one left
to play with.

44:46.676 --> 44:49.043
Players are gonna get hurt,
others are gonna get killed.

44:49.045 --> 44:51.045
And some will drop out.
It's not sustainable.

44:51.047 --> 44:52.216
We'll lose the game.

44:53.650 --> 44:55.016
Find new players.

44:55.018 --> 44:57.486
<i>He meant "Find new fish."</i>

44:57.488 --> 44:58.654
<i>I went recruiting again.</i>

44:58.656 --> 45:00.523
<i>First up was Donnie Silverman.</i>

45:00.525 --> 45:02.857
<i>Donnie won the World Series
of Poker last year</i>

45:02.859 --> 45:04.826
<i>and got in touch with me
through one of the players.</i>

45:04.828 --> 45:06.395
Are you fucking nuts?

45:06.397 --> 45:08.663
Donnie Silverman won
the World Series of Poker.

45:08.665 --> 45:10.098
You can watch it online.

45:10.100 --> 45:12.500
He took 11 hands
at the final table.

45:12.502 --> 45:14.969
But he had the nuts
on eight of them.

45:14.971 --> 45:17.239
And three of those...

45:17.241 --> 45:19.674
Three were two outers with
four players still in the hand.

45:19.676 --> 45:20.976
He ran hot.

45:20.978 --> 45:23.145
He doesn't lock his chips down,
he's reckless.

45:23.147 --> 45:26.581
He gives tons of action
and he's got $12 million.

45:31.355 --> 45:34.192
You know,
I don't like playing poker.

45:34.859 --> 45:35.991
Why do you play?

45:35.993 --> 45:38.060
I like destroying lives.

45:38.062 --> 45:39.264
Give him a chair.

45:40.797 --> 45:43.998
<i>The next recruit
was Brad Marion.</i>

45:44.000 --> 45:45.601
<i>Who everyone called Bad Brad</i>

45:45.603 --> 45:49.404
<i>because he was uniquely
terrible at this game.</i>

45:49.406 --> 45:51.839
<i>If there was a worse
player in the world</i>

45:51.841 --> 45:54.275
<i>Brad would still find a way
to lose to him.</i>

45:54.277 --> 45:56.277
Sorry, I don't have a chair,
but you're welcome to a drink.

45:56.279 --> 45:58.346
No, I just came to
introduce you to, uh, Brad...

45:58.348 --> 46:00.248
<i>I'm all in. Calling it.</i>

46:00.250 --> 46:02.083
- <i>Yeah, I call.</i>
- Sorry.

46:02.085 --> 46:03.719
I just wanted to introduce
you to Brad Marion.

46:03.721 --> 46:05.453
- <i>He wants to play.</i>
- Give me his information.

46:05.455 --> 46:07.422
- I'll check him out.
- Derek's gonna vouch for him.

46:07.424 --> 46:09.592
<i>"Derek's gonna vouch for him"
meant Derek would cover</i>

46:09.594 --> 46:13.298
<i>any losses if Brad didn't pay,
up to any amount.</i>

46:16.000 --> 46:17.799
- Hi, I'm Molly Bloom.
- Brad Marion.

46:17.801 --> 46:19.335
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

46:19.337 --> 46:21.603
<i>But he could pay and had to.</i>

46:21.605 --> 46:24.505
<i>Because he embraced the fallacy
of being pot committed.</i>

46:24.507 --> 46:25.907
I'm all in.

46:25.909 --> 46:27.477
<i>You've already invested so much</i>

46:27.479 --> 46:30.980
<i>you might as well see it
through to the end.</i>

46:30.982 --> 46:33.514
<i>Bad Brad had raised
$700 million</i>

46:33.516 --> 46:36.384
<i>for a fund that traded
oil futures and every week</i>

46:36.386 --> 46:39.388
<i>he came to the game,
lost a $100,000 and tipped me</i>

46:39.390 --> 46:42.391
<i>five thousand so he could
play the next week.</i>

46:42.393 --> 46:44.627
<i>He wasn't getting any better...</i>

46:44.629 --> 46:46.364
<i>and the guys were
feasting on him.</i>

46:50.467 --> 46:52.534
Can I get another 50?

46:52.536 --> 46:54.873
- Can we talk for a second?
- Sure.

46:56.940 --> 46:58.273
Brad, this game might not
be for you.

46:58.275 --> 47:00.477
I know I'm no card shark.

47:00.479 --> 47:01.947
No, you're not.

47:04.382 --> 47:06.547
Here are your losses
after ten weeks.

47:06.549 --> 47:09.183
And you've won... never.

47:09.185 --> 47:11.552
It's actually
a statistical anomaly.

47:11.554 --> 47:13.024
Yeah. I know.

47:14.225 --> 47:15.290
I like playing with the guys.

47:15.292 --> 47:17.025
I don't have that many friends.

47:17.027 --> 47:19.060
Don't take my seat away.

47:19.062 --> 47:20.362
I can tip you more.

47:20.364 --> 47:21.897
No.

47:21.899 --> 47:23.299
Your tips are very generous.

47:23.301 --> 47:25.333
How about I-I get you
some books.

47:25.335 --> 47:27.935
Or even, even a pro
to give you lessons?

47:27.937 --> 47:30.505
Yeah, maybe.

47:30.507 --> 47:33.107
- Yeah, let me think about it.
- Okay.

47:33.109 --> 47:35.978
<i>Turned out Bad Brad
knew what he was doing.</i>

47:35.980 --> 47:37.479
<i>He was getting customers.</i>

47:37.481 --> 47:39.248
<i>He'd drop his
100K at the game</i>

47:39.250 --> 47:41.317
<i>and pick up four million
for his hedge fund.</i>

47:41.319 --> 47:43.085
- Tell him what's smart...
- Not me.

47:43.087 --> 47:45.054
<i>More on that later, but first</i>

47:45.056 --> 47:46.355
<i>Harlan Eustice.</i>

47:46.357 --> 47:47.690
<i>Player X said he met Harlan</i>

47:47.692 --> 47:49.058
<i>at the Commerce Casino</i>

47:49.060 --> 47:50.525
<i>and that he'd be
good for the game.</i>

47:50.527 --> 47:52.427
<i>But I wasn't seeing
what he was seeing.</i>

47:52.429 --> 47:56.297
<i>He played tight, folding after
the hole cards 64% of the time.</i>

47:56.299 --> 47:58.333
<i>It wasn't clear
where his money came from.</i>

47:58.335 --> 48:00.369
<i>He produced backyard
wrestling videos</i>

48:00.371 --> 48:02.270
<i>and other low-rent productions.</i>

48:02.272 --> 48:03.572
<i>But worst of all</i>

48:03.574 --> 48:06.174
<i>Harlan Eustice
was a good card player.</i>

48:06.176 --> 48:09.310
<i>Why would Player X want someone
at the game who could beat him?</i>

48:09.312 --> 48:12.014
<i>I learned the answer
to that one the hard way.</i>

48:12.016 --> 48:14.382
- How was your flight?
- Just fine.

48:14.384 --> 48:16.585
How are you paying for tickets
between L.A. and New York?

48:16.587 --> 48:18.619
I had two million points
left on my Amex.

48:18.621 --> 48:20.221
They took the card,
but let me keep the points.

48:20.223 --> 48:21.422
Which I thought
was nice of them.

48:21.424 --> 48:23.726
- You had meetings.
- Hmm?

48:23.728 --> 48:25.828
You had meetings in L.A.
about your book and life rights.

48:25.830 --> 48:27.061
- I did.
- Was there any interest?

48:27.063 --> 48:28.563
A company that owns
four thousand

48:28.565 --> 48:29.464
video poker machines

48:29.466 --> 48:31.165
wants to put my face on them.

48:31.167 --> 48:33.335
Anything else?

48:33.337 --> 48:35.136
"Treat Magazine"
made a generous offer.

48:35.138 --> 48:36.472
- "Treat?"
- It's a new magazine.

48:36.474 --> 48:38.273
For the high-end
photography enthusiast.

48:38.275 --> 48:40.375
- They want you to pose naked.
- I'd be the April treat.

48:40.377 --> 48:42.143
I meant interest in your book.

48:42.145 --> 48:44.045
Ah, yeah.

48:44.047 --> 48:46.982
- Any offers?
- A few, I guess.

48:46.984 --> 48:49.016
Couple...

48:49.018 --> 48:50.052
Five.

48:50.054 --> 48:51.420
- Really?
- Yeah.

48:51.422 --> 48:53.020
- And...
- I passed.

48:53.022 --> 48:54.422
You're destitute
and you passed on

48:54.424 --> 48:56.023
five offers to turn
your book into a movie.

48:56.025 --> 48:57.058
You will be paid, Charlie.

48:57.060 --> 48:58.226
I'm just curious as to why

48:58.228 --> 48:59.395
you passed on
what would appear to be

48:59.397 --> 49:01.330
the only way out you have.

49:01.332 --> 49:02.531
Creative differences.

49:02.533 --> 49:04.333
- Okay.
- Should we start?

49:04.335 --> 49:06.435
You know, I am gonna
figure you out.

49:06.437 --> 49:07.636
Well, let me know
what you find.

49:07.638 --> 49:11.038
You see this?
This is discovery.

49:11.040 --> 49:13.442
Let's see what we discovered.

49:13.444 --> 49:16.244
Over here we have
Peter Druzhinsky

49:16.246 --> 49:18.980
Peter Antonovich
and Peter Slobo.

49:18.982 --> 49:20.181
The three Petes.

49:20.183 --> 49:21.315
Now the three Petes run a chain

49:21.317 --> 49:22.784
of corrupt medical clinics

49:22.786 --> 49:24.920
<i>and have been committing
insurance fraud</i>

49:24.922 --> 49:28.156
wire fraud and mail fraud
on an epic scale.

49:28.158 --> 49:29.391
Now, over here we have

49:29.393 --> 49:32.560
the Ragnyada-Gershen
Organization.

49:32.562 --> 49:34.695
They're a worldwide
bookmaking operation

49:34.697 --> 49:37.098
handling hundreds of millions
of dollars a year

49:37.100 --> 49:38.699
in illegal sports betting.

49:38.701 --> 49:39.868
And over here, we have

49:39.870 --> 49:42.538
<i>the Alexander-Habib
Organization.</i>

49:42.540 --> 49:45.239
This is also an illegal
sports betting organization.

49:45.241 --> 49:48.310
But this one,
financed by an art gallery

49:48.312 --> 49:51.746
owned by Shillel Habib,
who everyone calls...

49:51.748 --> 49:53.217
Shelly.

49:56.953 --> 50:01.123
This is the Russian Mafia
and the three are tied together

50:01.125 --> 50:04.226
in the indictment through...

50:04.228 --> 50:05.397
a poker game.

50:06.529 --> 50:08.464
- Were they tapping my phones?
- No.

50:08.466 --> 50:09.498
<i>Thank God.</i>

50:09.500 --> 50:10.531
They were tapping the phones

50:10.533 --> 50:11.833
of everyone you talked to.

50:11.835 --> 50:13.201
<i>Okay.</i>

50:13.203 --> 50:14.969
They got you confirming
that you ran raked games

50:14.971 --> 50:17.605
at the Plaza Hotel and various
locations in New York.

50:17.607 --> 50:19.907
<i>They've also got
a confidential informant</i>

50:19.909 --> 50:22.643
confirming that you ran
raked games at the Plaza Hotel

50:22.645 --> 50:24.413
and various locations
in New York.

50:24.415 --> 50:28.116
You were in violation of 1955,
which is a part of the U.S. Code

50:28.118 --> 50:31.252
<i>that makes it illegal to run
an illegal gambling business.</i>

50:31.254 --> 50:32.753
<i>You know what you did?</i>

50:32.755 --> 50:35.089
You finished writing a book
before the good part happened.

50:35.091 --> 50:37.726
You really get a kick out
of yourself, don't you?

50:37.728 --> 50:39.728
You know,
I don't like this picture.

50:39.730 --> 50:41.362
- Thank you.
- <i>You're like the cat...</i>

50:41.364 --> 50:42.531
That ate the canary
and then told

50:42.533 --> 50:43.931
the canary's
parents about it.

50:43.933 --> 50:45.199
<i>It's the picture
the publisher wanted</i>

50:45.201 --> 50:46.235
and I didn't get a vote.

50:46.237 --> 50:47.636
I liked the book, good story.

50:47.638 --> 50:49.003
- Well told.
- Thank you.

50:49.005 --> 50:50.272
I need you to tell
it again, though.

50:50.274 --> 50:51.406
From the beginning,
and this time

50:51.408 --> 50:53.074
without skipping over
the Russians.

50:53.076 --> 50:54.409
<i>Would you
like a glass of water?</i>

50:54.411 --> 50:56.246
I'd like a glass of Bourbon.

50:59.149 --> 51:01.215
- One more thing.
- <i>Yeah?</i>

51:01.217 --> 51:02.583
I need your hard drives.

51:02.585 --> 51:04.152
- Going back how far?
- What do you mean?

51:04.154 --> 51:06.955
Well, I kept my hard drives
when I'd buy a new laptop.

51:06.957 --> 51:08.123
- You're kidding.
- No.

51:08.125 --> 51:09.424
It had a record of who owed what

51:09.426 --> 51:10.458
and spreadsheets on the players.

51:10.460 --> 51:11.592
<i>It has more than that.</i>

51:11.594 --> 51:12.994
Every time you charge your phone

51:12.996 --> 51:14.563
by plugging it into the computer

51:14.565 --> 51:15.998
the computer takes a record

51:16.000 --> 51:17.866
<i>of all your text messages
and emails.</i>

51:17.868 --> 51:20.335
My laptop has a record
of all text messages and emails

51:20.337 --> 51:21.837
received years ago on phones

51:21.839 --> 51:23.538
that have been smashed
with an aluminum bat?

51:23.540 --> 51:26.607
I wanna run a forensic imaging
on your hard drives.

51:26.609 --> 51:28.710
Oh, no. Thanks anyway, but I'll
be destroying those hard drives.

51:28.712 --> 51:30.444
No, you can't do that,
they're evidence.

51:30.446 --> 51:31.880
I'm going to blow them up,
I am literally gonna use

51:31.882 --> 51:33.483
explosives and scatter
the remains in the sea.

51:33.485 --> 51:35.349
Except you told me they exist.

51:35.351 --> 51:36.486
You're gonna have
to pretend I didn't tell you.

51:36.488 --> 51:37.953
- Can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

51:37.955 --> 51:39.054
<i>You wanted a lawyer that</i>

51:39.056 --> 51:40.389
wasn't even a little bit shady.

51:40.391 --> 51:41.556
New information
has come to light.

51:41.558 --> 51:42.590
- I see that was stupid.
- Molly.

51:42.592 --> 51:43.926
There are no hard drives.

51:43.928 --> 51:45.627
If you destroy evidence
and obstruct justice

51:45.629 --> 51:47.462
on top of the charges
already brought against you

51:47.464 --> 51:50.165
in this case, you will be,
I promise, incarcerated.

51:50.167 --> 51:52.601
You don't understand
what's in those text messages.

51:52.603 --> 51:54.536
I understand you've had
boyfriends and there'll be

51:54.538 --> 51:56.572
some exchanges that are a little
bit, you know, embarrassing...

51:56.574 --> 51:59.308
I don't care about embarrassing
text messages from boyfriends

51:59.310 --> 52:01.076
as there is not left
the smallest corner

52:01.078 --> 52:02.411
of my private life

52:02.413 --> 52:04.712
that isn't available
for public scrutiny.

52:04.714 --> 52:07.516
There are messages that
would destroy other lives.

52:07.518 --> 52:09.284
<i>There are messages
that would end careers</i>

52:09.286 --> 52:10.786
and obliterate families.

52:10.788 --> 52:13.522
If those the text messages
were to be made public...

52:13.524 --> 52:14.922
- They won't be.
- If they were...

52:14.924 --> 52:17.259
- They won't be.
- It would be catastrophic.

52:17.261 --> 52:18.694
- I'm a lawyer, I'm legally...
- No.

52:18.696 --> 52:20.895
Listen to me,
I am legally prohibited

52:20.897 --> 52:21.897
from disclosing anything...

52:21.899 --> 52:23.331
Someone leaked
my last deposition

52:23.333 --> 52:24.933
to the National Enquirer,
Charlie.

52:24.935 --> 52:26.534
- Butterball?
- My last lawyer's name...

52:26.536 --> 52:28.536
Was Butterman
and he was one of five people

52:28.538 --> 52:30.371
in the room besides me.

52:30.373 --> 52:31.906
But the information
in that deposition

52:31.908 --> 52:34.409
will be nothing compared
to the consequences

52:34.411 --> 52:35.944
of those text messages...

52:35.946 --> 52:38.513
Ah! I just got it.

52:38.515 --> 52:39.648
Showing up everywhere.

52:39.650 --> 52:41.248
I couldn't figure out why you

52:41.250 --> 52:43.085
named some people
but not others.

52:43.087 --> 52:44.953
I thought that maybe
some people paid you.

52:44.955 --> 52:46.822
You were wrong.
But doesn't matter.

52:46.824 --> 52:48.956
No, the only people you named
in that book were the ones

52:48.958 --> 52:52.293
that were already named in
the Bad Brad Marion deposition.

52:52.295 --> 52:53.661
- Which you think...
- I know.

52:53.663 --> 52:54.929
- Somebody leaked it.
- Sold it.

52:54.931 --> 52:56.264
- <i>To the tabloids.</i>
- Yes.

52:56.266 --> 52:57.665
- Maybe even Butterbean.
- Butterman.

52:57.667 --> 52:59.000
But I don't know who it was.

52:59.002 --> 53:00.268
I watched Jenny McCarthy

53:00.270 --> 53:01.569
beat you up
for naming the players.

53:01.571 --> 53:02.670
Why didn't you just say,
"Hey, those names

53:02.672 --> 53:04.339
are already public record?"

53:04.341 --> 53:07.275
I don't know. 'Cause I wasn't
on "The View" under subpoena.

53:07.277 --> 53:09.377
Can we please get back
to the emails and texts?

53:09.379 --> 53:10.978
Is that why you have
creative differences

53:10.980 --> 53:12.014
with the Hollywood offers?

53:12.016 --> 53:13.281
<i>Because they want information</i>

53:13.283 --> 53:14.449
<i>and you won't give them.</i>

53:14.451 --> 53:15.485
- I don't know you.
- <i>Hm.</i>

53:15.487 --> 53:16.518
If what happened last time

53:16.520 --> 53:17.918
were to happen this time

53:17.920 --> 53:20.188
it would make
what happened last time...

53:20.190 --> 53:21.490
What is this for?

53:21.492 --> 53:23.357
It's got every text message
and email

53:23.359 --> 53:25.694
I sent in the last year
as well as a variety

53:25.696 --> 53:27.728
of incriminating evidence
about my clients.

53:27.730 --> 53:29.331
Now if anything
of yours get leaked

53:29.333 --> 53:31.732
you can sell my phone
to the highest bidder

53:31.734 --> 53:34.402
and I'll lose my job
and get disbarred.

53:34.404 --> 53:36.270
So in order to demonstrate
the sanctity

53:36.272 --> 53:38.339
of your attorney-client
confidentiality

53:38.341 --> 53:40.342
you're betraying
the confidentiality

53:40.344 --> 53:41.546
of all your other clients?

53:42.812 --> 53:45.147
I know you're not
gonna look at it.

53:45.149 --> 53:46.915
How do you know?

53:46.917 --> 53:47.919
I don't know.

53:54.223 --> 53:55.924
<i>I'll fly home to Colorado...</i>

53:55.926 --> 53:57.828
and be back the next day
with the hard drives.

54:00.397 --> 54:01.862
<i>Harlan Eustice was excited</i>

54:01.864 --> 54:03.831
<i>about the surprise
40th birthday party</i>

54:03.833 --> 54:06.134
<i>he was throwing for
his wife in 24 hours.</i>

54:06.136 --> 54:08.636
I rented out the whole
courtyard of the Buffalo Club.

54:08.638 --> 54:10.371
It'll be about a hundred people.

54:10.373 --> 54:13.074
Kumamoto oysters,
snow crab, lobsters.

54:13.076 --> 54:15.610
<i>He wasn't taking off
menu items to show off.</i>

54:15.612 --> 54:17.378
<i>He was genuinely excited
about the party</i>

54:17.380 --> 54:18.612
<i>he was giving his wife.</i>

54:18.614 --> 54:19.781
She doesn't know
anything about it.

54:19.783 --> 54:20.815
She thinks we're having dinner

54:20.817 --> 54:23.486
with her brother and his wife.

54:23.488 --> 54:24.985
<i>I liked Harlan.</i>

54:24.987 --> 54:27.490
<i>But nobody else liked him
except Player X.</i>

54:27.492 --> 54:29.257
- <i>He played tight.</i>
- Fold

54:29.259 --> 54:30.792
<i>Didn't give a lot of action</i>

54:30.794 --> 54:32.594
<i>and always got
his money in good.</i>

54:32.596 --> 54:34.429
<i>Which means he was
running the odds.</i>

54:34.431 --> 54:36.230
- <i>Five thousand to call.</i>
- No.

54:36.232 --> 54:38.766
<i>In other words,
he was playing poker.</i>

54:38.768 --> 54:40.504
<i>And the others were gambling.</i>

54:43.172 --> 54:44.408
<i>And he won.</i>

54:45.676 --> 54:48.176
<i>By midnight, Harlan had
tripled his original</i>

54:48.178 --> 54:50.177
<i>fifty thousand dollar buy-in.</i>

54:50.179 --> 54:53.248
<i>But everything came off
the rails with one hand.</i>

54:53.250 --> 54:54.616
<i>And that's how it happens.</i>

54:54.618 --> 54:56.618
<i>That's how you go full-tilt.</i>

54:56.620 --> 54:58.920
<i>Harlan, the best player
at the table</i>

54:58.922 --> 55:01.723
<i>the best player at most
tables was about to get</i>

55:01.725 --> 55:04.558
<i>bluffed off the win by,
of all people...</i>

55:04.560 --> 55:07.261
<i>Bad Brad. How?</i>

55:07.263 --> 55:09.964
<i>Because Harlan had never
played with Brad before</i>

55:09.966 --> 55:13.802
<i>and didn't know yet
that Brad was bad.</i>

55:13.804 --> 55:17.205
<i>Harlan's got a boat.
9's full.</i>

55:17.207 --> 55:18.672
<i>Brad's got nothing.</i>

55:18.674 --> 55:20.241
<i>But his pre-flop
betting made it look</i>

55:20.243 --> 55:22.810
<i>entirely accidently,
like there was</i>

55:22.812 --> 55:24.078
<i>a chance he had pocket kings.</i>

55:24.080 --> 55:25.279
Twenty thousand.

55:25.281 --> 55:26.614
<i>Which if true</i>

55:26.616 --> 55:29.284
<i>would give him
the better full house.</i>

55:29.286 --> 55:32.186
<i>Brad's counting off $20,000,
which means he's going to call</i>

55:32.188 --> 55:35.056
<i>and Harlan knows that if
Brad's gonna call and not raise</i>

55:35.058 --> 55:36.724
<i>it means he didn't
have the boat.</i>

55:36.726 --> 55:38.360
<i>And he's betting
a high two pair.</i>

55:38.362 --> 55:40.694
<i>Probably kings and queens.</i>

55:40.696 --> 55:42.496
<i>But then instead
of calling the bet</i>

55:42.498 --> 55:44.866
<i>Brad pushes $72,000
into the pot.</i>

55:44.868 --> 55:45.902
I'm all in.

55:47.103 --> 55:48.869
<i>Harlan looks at Brad.</i>

55:48.871 --> 55:50.772
<i>Every tell Harlan knows about</i>

55:50.774 --> 55:53.741
<i>carotid artery pumping,
stiff hands...</i>

55:53.743 --> 55:55.777
<i>Brad's doing the opposite.</i>

55:55.779 --> 55:57.712
<i>Brad's betting represented
a huge hand</i>

55:57.714 --> 55:59.147
<i>by calling on the flop</i>

55:59.149 --> 56:01.483
<i>check raising the turn
and bombing the river.</i>

56:01.485 --> 56:02.984
<i>Of course, Harlan didn't know</i>

56:02.986 --> 56:05.753
<i>that Brad didn't know
what any of that meant.</i>

56:05.755 --> 56:08.290
<i>So Harlan, always
a good sport said...</i>

56:08.292 --> 56:10.292
Nice bet. I'm laying this down.

56:10.294 --> 56:14.596
<i>As he tossed in what he
didn't realize was the winning hand</i>

56:14.598 --> 56:16.364
<i>Brad tosses in his cards too</i>

56:16.366 --> 56:18.599
<i>and one of them flips
over and Harlan sees...</i>

56:18.601 --> 56:21.703
You didn't have pocket kings?

56:21.705 --> 56:22.737
I didn't have any kings

56:22.739 --> 56:24.940
except the one in the middle.

56:24.942 --> 56:28.076
- You had two pair?
- I had one pair.

56:28.078 --> 56:29.481
The nines in the middle.

56:37.987 --> 56:38.989
Thank you.

56:41.324 --> 56:43.391
<i>It wasn't even that
it was that much money.</i>

56:43.393 --> 56:46.527
<i>Harlan only lost
about $40,000 on the hand.</i>

56:46.529 --> 56:47.962
<i>But a circuit breaker blew</i>

56:47.964 --> 56:50.165
<i>and Harlan was
out for blood now.</i>

56:50.167 --> 56:52.266
<i>Everyone's.</i>

56:52.268 --> 56:54.668
<i>We have a
$112,000 on the table.</i>

56:54.670 --> 56:56.304
<i>You want another 50?</i>

56:56.306 --> 56:57.605
Give me another 100, please.

57:00.611 --> 57:02.543
Sign here for a 100,000.

57:02.545 --> 57:05.447
<i>By 5 a.m., Harlan
was down half a million.</i>

57:05.449 --> 57:07.581
<i>He'd abandoned everything
he knew about poker</i>

57:07.583 --> 57:09.049
<i>and was playing
like a frat kid</i>

57:09.051 --> 57:11.688
<i>swinging for a home run
on every hand.</i>

57:13.891 --> 57:16.324
- Another 100 please.
- Hey, bud...

57:16.326 --> 57:18.129
Molly, please. Let's go.

57:19.795 --> 57:21.265
<i>Sign here for a 100.</i>

57:30.774 --> 57:33.275
<i>Text messages were going
out letting everyone know</i>

57:33.277 --> 57:34.775
<i>Harlan was bleeding.</i>

57:34.777 --> 57:35.844
<i>Guys were coming by to play</i>

57:35.846 --> 57:37.411
<i>for a couple hours before work.</i>

57:37.413 --> 57:39.413
<i>They'd been losing
to him for months.</i>

57:39.415 --> 57:41.782
<i>Everyone wanted a check
from Harlan Eustice.</i>

57:41.784 --> 57:42.984
If you go home now you can have

57:42.986 --> 57:45.386
a few hours sleep
before Sheila's party.

57:45.388 --> 57:46.556
Soon.

57:48.091 --> 57:49.657
Come talk to me.

57:49.659 --> 57:51.795
Hi, guys.
Help yourself to some coffee.

57:56.500 --> 57:58.333
You're on tilt.

57:58.335 --> 57:59.668
Everybody knows it.

57:59.670 --> 58:00.735
You're playing
without the weapons

58:00.737 --> 58:01.939
you need to win.

58:02.705 --> 58:03.908
You're right.

58:04.808 --> 58:06.043
Alright, thank you.

58:06.810 --> 58:08.612
Just give me $500,000.

58:10.346 --> 58:11.913
I just gotta get back to even.

58:11.915 --> 58:13.348
<i>That should be the second line</i>

58:13.350 --> 58:15.049
<i>of every gambler's obit.</i>

58:15.051 --> 58:18.752
<i>Mr. Feldstein died while
trying to get back to even.</i>

58:18.754 --> 58:19.920
<i>Harlan never did.</i>

58:19.922 --> 58:21.188
<i>And he never got to his wife's</i>

58:21.190 --> 58:22.424
<i>birthday party.</i>

58:22.426 --> 58:25.025
<i>She filed for divorce
two days later.</i>

58:25.027 --> 58:27.295
<i>There was one last punch coming</i>

58:27.297 --> 58:29.300
<i>that would put Harlan
on the floor for good.</i>

58:31.100 --> 58:33.335
<i>Harlan was heads up against
a guy named Frederick</i>

58:33.337 --> 58:35.039
<i>who was Austrian royalty.</i>

58:37.074 --> 58:37.938
Call.

58:37.940 --> 58:39.741
<i>Harlan had pocket queens.</i>

58:39.743 --> 58:42.110
<i>His Excellency had ace king.</i>

58:42.112 --> 58:45.313
<i>They were both in 65K pre-flop.</i>

58:45.315 --> 58:46.781
<i>Flops queen seven-seven.</i>

58:46.783 --> 58:48.349
<i>Harlan has a full house again.</i>

58:48.351 --> 58:50.085
<i>Queens full of sevens.</i>

58:50.087 --> 58:52.686
<i>With three rounds of betting
in front of him...</i>

58:52.688 --> 58:54.324
<i>the Count has nothing.</i>

58:57.761 --> 59:00.127
- All in.
- And the Count goes all in.

59:00.129 --> 59:01.529
<i>He wants Harlan
to think he's got</i>

59:01.531 --> 59:02.730
<i>two more sevens under there.</i>

59:02.732 --> 59:04.366
- Call.
- <i>"Nope," says Harlan.</i>

59:04.368 --> 59:07.701
<i>He's not falling for this again
and he snap calls all in.</i>

59:07.703 --> 59:10.341
<i>There's $750,000 on the table.</i>

59:11.808 --> 59:15.310
<i>Diego burns a card
and deals a turn.</i>

59:15.312 --> 59:18.913
<i>A king. Otto Von Bismarck
now has two pair.</i>

59:18.915 --> 59:20.882
<i>Kings and sevens.</i>

59:20.884 --> 59:23.384
<i>But two pair is nothing
next to a full house.</i>

59:23.386 --> 59:24.685
<i>And at this point</i>

59:24.687 --> 59:25.886
<i>the only hand left that can</i>

59:25.888 --> 59:27.657
<i>beat a queen full house...</i>

59:29.091 --> 59:30.794
<i>is a king full house.</i>

59:32.228 --> 59:35.429
<i>Captain Von Trapp
bluffed two pair</i>

59:35.431 --> 59:37.767
<i>and rivered into kings full.</i>

59:38.801 --> 59:40.567
Motherfucker!

59:40.569 --> 59:41.835
<i>Motherfucker!</i>

59:41.837 --> 59:43.938
- Fuck you, fucking mechanic.
- Hey!

59:43.940 --> 59:45.973
Fuck you, you bottom-dealing
party magician!

59:45.975 --> 59:47.442
Hey! Get out on the terrace.

59:47.444 --> 59:49.210
You've been pulling this shit
on me for two days!

59:49.212 --> 59:51.415
- Come on, come on.
- Party magician.

59:53.549 --> 59:55.419
- You good?
- I'm okay, thanks.

01:00:00.957 --> 01:00:02.790
<i>What the hell?</i>

01:00:02.792 --> 01:00:05.560
I'll apologize to Diego.

01:00:05.562 --> 01:00:07.529
Yeah. And you're gonna go home.

01:00:07.531 --> 01:00:09.199
I'm making a floor call,
that's it.

01:00:10.866 --> 01:00:12.035
<i>Did you hear me?</i>

01:00:13.335 --> 01:00:14.804
I don't have it.

01:00:18.542 --> 01:00:20.011
A million two.

01:00:20.877 --> 01:00:22.112
I don't have it.

01:00:25.714 --> 01:00:27.017
I'm sorry.

01:00:35.125 --> 01:00:36.393
Go home.

01:00:38.495 --> 01:00:39.996
I'm very sorry.

01:00:42.799 --> 01:00:45.469
You got to tell
Sheila the truth, okay?

01:00:47.036 --> 01:00:49.603
Tell her the truth.
Tell her what happened.

01:00:49.605 --> 01:00:53.440
And I'm gonna help you.
I'm gonna get you to a meeting.

01:00:53.442 --> 01:00:56.143
We'll meet tomorrow
and figure out

01:00:56.145 --> 01:00:57.981
what to do about the money.

01:01:11.627 --> 01:01:13.460
<i>Harlan and I
didn't meet the next day.</i>

01:01:13.462 --> 01:01:15.362
<i>He just called me
and said everything was okay</i>

01:01:15.364 --> 01:01:17.165
<i>and showed up the next week
with a bank check</i>

01:01:17.167 --> 01:01:19.500
<i>for a million, two hundred
thousand dollars.</i>

01:01:19.502 --> 01:01:21.902
<i>Where did he
get the money from?</i>

01:01:21.904 --> 01:01:23.804
- I loaned it to him.
- Loaned it?

01:01:23.806 --> 01:01:26.107
<i>I get 50% of his wins
until the debt's paid off.</i>

01:01:26.109 --> 01:01:29.576
And then fifty percent for the
next two years with no exposure.

01:01:29.578 --> 01:01:31.246
You're getting 50% of the wins.

01:01:31.248 --> 01:01:34.181
- And no exposure on the losses?
- Yeah.

01:01:34.183 --> 01:01:35.917
First of all, he'll never
climb out of that.

01:01:35.919 --> 01:01:37.851
That's sharecropper math.

01:01:37.853 --> 01:01:40.522
It's also usury.
It's racketeering.

01:01:40.524 --> 01:01:42.523
<i>Second, you can't
stake a player</i>

01:01:42.525 --> 01:01:44.224
and play in the game
at the same time.

01:01:44.226 --> 01:01:46.860
I've been doing it
for two years.

01:01:46.862 --> 01:01:49.332
- You've been staking Harlan?
- Yeah.

01:01:50.567 --> 01:01:53.234
- Jesus Christ.
- <i>It's not cheating.</i>

01:01:53.236 --> 01:01:54.502
It creates
the opportunity for it.

01:01:54.504 --> 01:01:56.237
- Tell me how.
- Are you kidding me?

01:01:56.239 --> 01:01:58.072
- Tell me how!
- You've interest in another...

01:01:58.074 --> 01:01:59.206
You think I'm going
to take a dive?

01:01:59.208 --> 01:02:01.074
And if I did, who would care?

01:02:01.076 --> 01:02:02.342
You fold your hole cards.

01:02:02.344 --> 01:02:04.045
Five of clubs,
and a jack of hearts.

01:02:04.047 --> 01:02:05.078
He's still in the game.

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:06.481
It would benefit him to know

01:02:06.483 --> 01:02:07.514
that the five of clubs...

01:02:07.516 --> 01:02:08.549
You think I'm signaling him?

01:02:08.551 --> 01:02:09.583
I'm saying it can't

01:02:09.585 --> 01:02:11.054
fucking happen again.

01:02:17.426 --> 01:02:21.462
- You disapprove of me.
- It's not personal.

01:02:21.464 --> 01:02:23.096
<i>It feels personal
when you chat up</i>

01:02:23.098 --> 01:02:24.766
<i>every other guy
at the game except me.</i>

01:02:24.768 --> 01:02:27.168
When you stay late for a drink
with J.T. but never...

01:02:27.170 --> 01:02:28.835
Have you visited his Oscar?

01:02:28.837 --> 01:02:31.072
I think it's bolted
on the hood of his car.

01:02:31.074 --> 01:02:33.440
<i>It's noticeable,
when you go out of your way</i>

01:02:33.442 --> 01:02:35.143
to demonstrate that you
have no interest in me.

01:02:35.145 --> 01:02:37.011
You did the same thing to Dean.

01:02:37.013 --> 01:02:38.980
These guys want to play cards
with me, not you!

01:02:38.982 --> 01:02:40.415
Be that as it may...

01:02:40.417 --> 01:02:42.116
You know who the biggest
winner in this game is?

01:02:42.118 --> 01:02:43.183
- It's you.
- You know who...

01:02:43.185 --> 01:02:44.284
The second biggest winner is?

01:02:44.286 --> 01:02:45.989
- Look...
- It's you.

01:02:47.424 --> 01:02:49.357
<i>What are you taking home,
10,000 a night now?</i>

01:02:49.359 --> 01:02:51.391
That is my business,
literally.

01:02:51.393 --> 01:02:53.460
Between you, the dealers
and the servers

01:02:53.462 --> 01:02:55.230
you're taking a lot of money
out of this game.

01:02:55.232 --> 01:02:56.898
Not as much
as I'm bringing to it.

01:02:56.900 --> 01:02:58.232
That 10,000 is 10,000

01:02:58.234 --> 01:02:59.667
that doesn't go in my pocket.

01:02:59.669 --> 01:03:01.034
Again, my money is...

01:03:01.036 --> 01:03:03.871
Your money is my money.

01:03:03.873 --> 01:03:05.873
Is it?

01:03:05.875 --> 01:03:08.344
I think we should talk
about capping your tips.

01:03:11.413 --> 01:03:13.114
You want to get together
with the other players

01:03:13.116 --> 01:03:16.551
who on my tax returns,
are called clients

01:03:16.553 --> 01:03:18.685
and discuss putting
a ceiling on my wages?

01:03:18.687 --> 01:03:20.621
That's right.

01:03:20.623 --> 01:03:24.361
It'll be America's most closely
watched anti-trust case.

01:03:25.962 --> 01:03:27.328
<i>Right there, right then</i>

01:03:27.330 --> 01:03:30.531
<i>that fast, I lost the game.</i>

01:03:30.533 --> 01:03:32.799
<i>It was the next Tuesday,
game night.</i>

01:03:32.801 --> 01:03:35.869
<i>He waited until he knew
I'd be on the way to the hotel</i>

01:03:35.871 --> 01:03:37.474
<i>and then sent me a text.</i>

01:03:42.545 --> 01:03:44.311
<i>It said, "We're playing
at Dave's tonight.</i>

01:03:44.313 --> 01:03:45.679
<i>No need to show up."</i>

01:03:45.681 --> 01:03:47.815
<i>And I knew the truth
even before I answered</i>

01:03:47.817 --> 01:03:49.453
<i>the call that came next.</i>

01:03:55.424 --> 01:03:57.824
<i>You are so fucked.</i>

01:04:11.507 --> 01:04:13.607
There's no such word
as verticality.

01:04:13.609 --> 01:04:16.511
- Hmm?
- <i>In the book, on page 152.</i>

01:04:16.513 --> 01:04:18.846
"When you lose the game in L.A.
and come to New York

01:04:18.848 --> 01:04:20.915
you admire
the city's verticality."

01:04:20.917 --> 01:04:21.949
It's a word.

01:04:21.951 --> 01:04:23.083
Once you're in New York

01:04:23.085 --> 01:04:24.118
you talk about games

01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:26.219
lasting all night, two nights.

01:04:26.221 --> 01:04:29.991
Bein' up for days,
but you don't mention drugs.

01:04:29.993 --> 01:04:31.458
There were drugs.
I'm two years clean.

01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:33.027
But you left the drugs
out of the book.

01:04:33.029 --> 01:04:35.096
You know what?
I'm not paying you $250,000

01:04:35.098 --> 01:04:36.331
for your Amazon
customer review.

01:04:36.333 --> 01:04:38.532
So far, you're not
paying me for anything.

01:04:38.534 --> 01:04:40.234
I just emailed you
verticality

01:04:40.236 --> 01:04:42.536
from Merriam-Webster's
Dictionary.

01:04:42.538 --> 01:04:45.042
What's an advance
on a book like this?

01:04:46.109 --> 01:04:48.245
The advance?

01:04:49.913 --> 01:04:51.212
It depends.

01:04:51.214 --> 01:04:52.913
<i>If you guarantee the publishers</i>

01:04:52.915 --> 01:04:54.114
certain elements

01:04:54.116 --> 01:04:56.083
then I can get you
a million and a half.

01:04:56.085 --> 01:04:57.652
Which you'd probably
double on sales

01:04:57.654 --> 01:04:58.920
plus ancillary rights.

01:04:58.922 --> 01:05:00.288
What kind of elements?

01:05:00.290 --> 01:05:03.290
- You have to use real names.
- Eli...

01:05:03.292 --> 01:05:05.494
There's a guy who sits
outside my Starbucks

01:05:05.495 --> 01:05:07.962
with a, uh,
with a cardboard sign

01:05:07.964 --> 01:05:09.429
that says "Vietnam Vet."

01:05:09.431 --> 01:05:11.299
And every morning,
I give him a quarter.

01:05:11.301 --> 01:05:13.266
And right now,
the only difference

01:05:13.268 --> 01:05:14.634
between you and him

01:05:14.636 --> 01:05:16.237
is that you have
a story.

01:05:16.239 --> 01:05:17.938
I'm one thousand
percent sure that

01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:19.741
the homeless Vietnam vet
has a better one.

01:05:19.743 --> 01:05:21.477
You have one asset.

01:05:21.479 --> 01:05:23.076
Write your story
and I can get you

01:05:23.078 --> 01:05:25.481
a million and a half,
and-and that's the floor.

01:05:25.483 --> 01:05:27.382
Go big or go home

01:05:27.384 --> 01:05:28.815
and live with your mother.

01:05:28.817 --> 01:05:30.487
For the rest of your life.

01:05:33.790 --> 01:05:35.259
What if I...

01:05:37.861 --> 01:05:39.127
What if I told the publishers

01:05:39.129 --> 01:05:42.295
that I-I would name the players

01:05:42.297 --> 01:05:44.931
who are already named in
the Brad Marion Deposition?

01:05:44.933 --> 01:05:46.202
All four?

01:05:47.404 --> 01:05:49.103
I'll use the real names
of the players

01:05:49.105 --> 01:05:50.938
who are already
named by Bad Brad.

01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:52.607
- What if I told them that?
- You spent eight years...

01:05:52.609 --> 01:05:54.308
In Hollywood and
two years in New York

01:05:54.310 --> 01:05:55.676
running the world's
most exclusive

01:05:55.678 --> 01:05:57.944
glamorous and decadent
man cave.

01:05:57.946 --> 01:05:59.514
<i>So what do the
publishers get from you</i>

01:05:59.516 --> 01:06:01.518
<i>about people with real names?</i>

01:06:03.853 --> 01:06:05.789
My advance was $35,000.

01:06:07.490 --> 01:06:08.855
Well, the first thing
I'm gonna do is

01:06:08.857 --> 01:06:10.424
get you a minor role reduction.

01:06:10.426 --> 01:06:12.259
Get the 12 points
knocked down to ten.

01:06:12.261 --> 01:06:13.927
- What's a minor role reduction?
- <i>I'm going to argue...</i>

01:06:13.929 --> 01:06:16.563
To the prosecutor that you're,
uh, an employee that was

01:06:16.565 --> 01:06:18.232
hired and fired
by the players.

01:06:18.234 --> 01:06:20.634
- Not a chance.
- I think we got a good chance.

01:06:20.636 --> 01:06:22.235
No, not a chance I'm letting
you make that argument.

01:06:22.237 --> 01:06:24.572
- Why not?
- <i>It's not true.</i>

01:06:24.574 --> 01:06:26.007
Let me explain how
the point system works.

01:06:26.009 --> 01:06:27.340
I know how it works.

01:06:27.342 --> 01:06:29.342
Points correspond
with the prosecutor's

01:06:29.344 --> 01:06:30.777
sentencing recommendation.

01:06:30.779 --> 01:06:31.978
You try to get a point reduction

01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:33.281
based on a variety of factors

01:06:33.283 --> 01:06:35.483
including, say,
prior criminal history

01:06:35.485 --> 01:06:37.518
which I don't have,
or whether the defendant

01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:39.453
<i>played a minor role,
which I certainly did not.</i>

01:06:39.455 --> 01:06:41.188
You really think this is
a good time to hog credit?

01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:42.456
- I built it from scratch.
- <i>No.</i>

01:06:42.458 --> 01:06:43.723
There was already a game
at the Cobra Lounge

01:06:43.725 --> 01:06:44.792
when you came along.

01:06:44.794 --> 01:06:46.326
The New York game is
what I'm talking about.

01:06:46.328 --> 01:06:47.761
I built from scratch.

01:06:47.763 --> 01:06:48.929
<i>I wasn't fireable.</i>

01:06:48.931 --> 01:06:49.964
I made sure of that.

01:06:49.966 --> 01:06:51.268
So, no.

01:06:52.469 --> 01:06:53.500
I wasn't really listening.

01:06:53.502 --> 01:06:55.235
I'm refusing you permission

01:06:55.237 --> 01:06:56.570
to seek a minor role reduction.

01:06:56.572 --> 01:06:58.005
I'm refusing you permission

01:06:58.007 --> 01:06:59.540
to invalidate
my entire career.

01:06:59.542 --> 01:07:01.808
- And I'm not caring.
- I built a successful...

01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:03.312
Hey, do you want kids?

01:07:05.147 --> 01:07:07.181
You interested
in having a family?

01:07:07.183 --> 01:07:08.648
Very much.

01:07:08.650 --> 01:07:10.317
<i>I don't get you
some point reductions</i>

01:07:10.319 --> 01:07:11.985
and the sentencing
recommendation guidelines

01:07:11.987 --> 01:07:13.386
say eight to twelve years.

01:07:13.388 --> 01:07:15.056
And that's before they
try to jam you up

01:07:15.058 --> 01:07:16.623
more for money laundering.

01:07:16.625 --> 01:07:18.860
The moment you changed the
Russian's money for chips...

01:07:18.862 --> 01:07:20.627
I would've had to been aware
where the money was...

01:07:20.629 --> 01:07:22.663
Find me twelve men and women
who'll believe

01:07:22.665 --> 01:07:24.665
that you weren't aware
of exactly who was sitting

01:07:24.667 --> 01:07:26.299
at your table
and where the money came from.

01:07:26.301 --> 01:07:27.935
So, that's it.

01:07:27.937 --> 01:07:30.239
You were a cocktail waitress.

01:07:35.011 --> 01:07:39.380
<i>When I lost the L.A. game,
I told myself it was no big deal.</i>

01:07:39.382 --> 01:07:41.382
<i>It was just supposed
to be an adventure</i>

01:07:41.384 --> 01:07:43.853
<i>and a way to meet
influential people.</i>

01:07:45.587 --> 01:07:48.424
<i>And I'd saved over $200,000.</i>

01:07:50.092 --> 01:07:52.793
<i>But that was just a weak
firewall I'd hastily built</i>

01:07:52.795 --> 01:07:55.263
<i>to keep out the humiliation
and depression</i>

01:07:55.265 --> 01:07:56.732
<i>I knew was coming.</i>

01:08:00.536 --> 01:08:02.371
<i>It had to end sometime.</i>

01:08:03.672 --> 01:08:05.908
<i>I just thought
it would be on my time.</i>

01:08:07.342 --> 01:08:10.143
<i>The game had given me
an identity</i>

01:08:10.145 --> 01:08:12.612
<i>respect and a defined place</i>

01:08:12.614 --> 01:08:15.616
<i>in a world
that was inaccessible.</i>

01:08:15.618 --> 01:08:19.188
<i>And in one irrational
heartbeat, it was taken away.</i>

01:08:21.223 --> 01:08:23.424
<i>I was irrelevant...</i>

01:08:23.426 --> 01:08:25.562
<i>and forgotten, overnight.</i>

01:08:28.897 --> 01:08:31.898
<i>It'd been two weeks
since I lost the game...</i>

01:08:31.899 --> 01:08:33.868
<i>and I made an appointment
to see someone.</i>

01:08:33.870 --> 01:08:36.636
<i>Because now,
the humiliation and depression</i>

01:08:36.638 --> 01:08:38.604
<i>had given way
to a blinding anger</i>

01:08:38.607 --> 01:08:42.278
<i>at my powerlessness
over the unfair whims of men.</i>

01:08:44.781 --> 01:08:47.147
<i>It was that
there weren't any rules.</i>

01:08:47.149 --> 01:08:50.417
<i>These power moves weren't
framed by right and wrong.</i>

01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:52.587
<i>Just ego and vanity.</i>

01:08:52.589 --> 01:08:55.322
<i>Selfish whims with
no regard for consequence.</i>

01:08:55.323 --> 01:08:57.090
<i>No fairness, no justice.</i>

01:08:57.091 --> 01:08:59.893
<i>And that giggling,
cackling call from Player X.</i>

01:08:59.895 --> 01:09:01.761
<i>You're so fucked.</i>

01:09:01.764 --> 01:09:03.763
<i>I couldn't lose to that
green-screened little shit.</i>

01:09:03.765 --> 01:09:05.066
<i>And I didn't want a therapist</i>

01:09:05.068 --> 01:09:07.701
<i>to make me feel okay about it.</i>

01:09:07.703 --> 01:09:10.670
<i>You know what makes you feel
okay about losing?</i>

01:09:10.671 --> 01:09:12.439
<i>Winning.</i>

01:09:12.442 --> 01:09:14.307
<i>I got on a plane to New York.</i>

01:09:16.645 --> 01:09:19.045
<i>Wall Street. Madison Avenue.</i>

01:09:19.046 --> 01:09:21.348
<i>Fifth Avenue. The Dakota.</i>

01:09:21.350 --> 01:09:22.582
<i>The San Remo.</i>

01:09:22.585 --> 01:09:24.118
<i>The players were here.</i>

01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:25.986
<i>I just had to bait the hook.</i>

01:09:25.988 --> 01:09:29.491
<i>This time,
I didn't have movie stars.</i>

01:09:29.493 --> 01:09:32.325
<i>This time,
I used Playboy Playmates.</i>

01:09:32.327 --> 01:09:34.629
<i>These weren't
just any Playmates.</i>

01:09:34.631 --> 01:09:36.630
<i>Jesse was
a Puerto Rican knockout</i>

01:09:36.631 --> 01:09:38.398
<i>who grew up working
in card rooms</i>

01:09:38.399 --> 01:09:40.500
<i>and was a good player herself.</i>

01:09:40.502 --> 01:09:42.803
<i>I could stake her,
infiltrate other games</i>

01:09:42.805 --> 01:09:45.205
<i>and poach
their big ticket players.</i>

01:09:45.207 --> 01:09:46.673
<i>Shelby could write code</i>

01:09:46.675 --> 01:09:48.477
<i>and run more thorough
background checks</i>

01:09:48.479 --> 01:09:51.044
<i>than the T.S.A.</i>

01:09:51.046 --> 01:09:54.014
<i>Winston was the daughter
of an American diplomat.</i>

01:09:54.015 --> 01:09:55.483
<i>She's lived in nine
different countries</i>

01:09:55.485 --> 01:09:57.284
<i>and had the email addresses</i>

01:09:57.286 --> 01:09:59.687
<i>of half
the Saudi Royal Family.</i>

01:09:59.689 --> 01:10:01.554
<i>Who's the biggest
game in Manhattan?</i>

01:10:01.556 --> 01:10:05.026
On any given night, it's either
Teddy Chin or Tutti Toscano.

01:10:05.028 --> 01:10:07.194
<i>- But that's Manhattan.
- What do you mean?</i>

01:10:07.196 --> 01:10:09.329
Biggest game in New York
is in Brooklyn.

01:10:09.331 --> 01:10:10.798
Russian Jews.

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:11.632
Buy-in's a 100k.

01:10:11.634 --> 01:10:12.866
No one runs the game.

01:10:12.868 --> 01:10:14.634
They just play and pay.

01:10:14.636 --> 01:10:16.570
<i>We couldn't promise anyone
they'd rub elbows</i>

01:10:16.572 --> 01:10:18.039
<i>with movie stars.</i>

01:10:18.041 --> 01:10:19.106
<i>But New York has one thing</i>

01:10:19.108 --> 01:10:20.240
<i>Hollywood doesn't.</i>

01:10:20.242 --> 01:10:21.676
<i>The Yankees.</i>

01:10:21.678 --> 01:10:23.410
<i>And there was one
Yankee in particular</i>

01:10:23.412 --> 01:10:24.712
<i>that every man in America</i>

01:10:24.714 --> 01:10:26.146
<i>would line up to lose to.</i>

01:10:26.148 --> 01:10:27.482
Don't say his name out loud.

01:10:27.484 --> 01:10:29.215
Write it on a cocktail napkin.

01:10:29.217 --> 01:10:30.418
Crumple up the napkin up.

01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:31.785
<i>Put it in a glass of water</i>

01:10:31.787 --> 01:10:33.353
<i>so they can see
the ink dissolve.</i>

01:10:33.355 --> 01:10:34.688
- That's really necessary?
- <i>No.</i>

01:10:34.690 --> 01:10:36.190
It's not at all necessary.

01:10:36.192 --> 01:10:37.223
When do we tell them the game

01:10:37.225 --> 01:10:38.526
is going to start?

01:10:38.528 --> 01:10:39.727
Tell them it's been happening

01:10:39.729 --> 01:10:41.896
once a week for about six months

01:10:41.898 --> 01:10:44.330
at a location you won't
disclose right now.

01:10:44.332 --> 01:10:46.032
There's a pretty long
waiting list for a chair

01:10:46.034 --> 01:10:48.636
but Molly's here somewhere

01:10:48.638 --> 01:10:50.370
and I'll introduce you to her.

01:10:50.372 --> 01:10:52.572
50K buy-in,
blinds are five and one?

01:10:52.574 --> 01:10:54.711
Yeah, fifty...

01:10:58.113 --> 01:10:59.146
Mol?

01:10:59.148 --> 01:11:00.780
50K buy-in?

01:11:00.782 --> 01:11:03.817
No, 250.

01:11:03.819 --> 01:11:05.453
That's going to make noise.

01:11:05.455 --> 01:11:08.091
Enough to be
heard on Rodeo Drive.

01:11:11.961 --> 01:11:13.694
<i>The Gold Coast of Long Island</i>

01:11:13.696 --> 01:11:15.329
<i>has been home
to the Vanderbilts</i>

01:11:15.331 --> 01:11:16.664
<i>Roosevelts, Whitneys</i>

01:11:16.666 --> 01:11:19.133
<i>J.P. Morgan
and F.W. Woolworth.</i>

01:11:19.135 --> 01:11:22.570
It's an impossible ticket
to get, but I can talk to Molly.

01:11:22.572 --> 01:11:25.338
<i>Tonight was a $10,000
per person fundraiser</i>

01:11:25.340 --> 01:11:26.639
<i>to pay for major renovations</i>

01:11:26.641 --> 01:11:28.342
<i>at the East Hampton Yacht Club.</i>

01:11:28.344 --> 01:11:29.810
Molly's around here somewhere.

01:11:29.812 --> 01:11:31.712
I could introduce you, but I
wouldn't get my hopes up.

01:11:31.714 --> 01:11:32.812
<i>That's for real.</i>

01:11:32.814 --> 01:11:33.914
<i>There was a charity event</i>

01:11:33.916 --> 01:11:35.382
<i>for residents of the Hamptons</i>

01:11:35.384 --> 01:11:36.485
<i>who own yachts.</i>

01:11:36.487 --> 01:11:37.651
<i>In my business, that's called</i>

01:11:37.653 --> 01:11:39.018
<i>a target-rich environment.</i>

01:11:39.020 --> 01:11:41.856
I have to tell you
the initial buy-in is $250,000.

01:11:41.858 --> 01:11:45.395
$250,000? That's almost as much
as my second car.

01:11:46.528 --> 01:11:48.329
Your friends come to the games?

01:11:48.331 --> 01:11:49.597
Mm-hm.

01:11:49.599 --> 01:11:50.664
<i>It took only 7 weeks</i>

01:11:50.666 --> 01:11:52.199
<i>of recruiting to get 10 players</i>

01:11:52.201 --> 01:11:54.067
<i>and 7 on a waiting list.</i>

01:11:54.069 --> 01:11:55.369
<i>And in these circles</i>

01:11:55.371 --> 01:11:56.402
<i>that was more than enough</i>

01:11:56.404 --> 01:11:58.539
<i>to start the mythology.</i>

01:11:58.541 --> 01:12:00.441
<i>By morning,
gamblers would be telling</i>

01:12:00.443 --> 01:12:03.009
<i>and hearing stories
about this game in London</i>

01:12:03.011 --> 01:12:05.245
<i>Tokyo and Dubai.</i>

01:12:05.247 --> 01:12:06.312
<i>At the end of that year</i>

01:12:06.314 --> 01:12:07.447
<i>I reported an income</i>

01:12:07.449 --> 01:12:11.252
<i>of $4,773,000.</i>

01:12:11.254 --> 01:12:14.855
<i>Every square inch of it
legal and on the books.</i>

01:12:14.857 --> 01:12:17.491
<i>I was the biggest game runner
in the world.</i>

01:12:17.493 --> 01:12:18.825
<i>All tips.</i>

01:12:18.827 --> 01:12:20.361
<i>I still hadn't taken a rake</i>

01:12:20.363 --> 01:12:22.629
<i>and I still hadn't accidentally
recruited members</i>

01:12:22.631 --> 01:12:24.865
<i>of a Russian crime syndicate.</i>

01:12:24.867 --> 01:12:27.668
<i>In the beginning, I was using
drugs to stay awake.</i>

01:12:27.670 --> 01:12:29.904
<i>First Adderall,
then Adderall crushed up</i>

01:12:29.906 --> 01:12:31.838
<i>to defeat the time release.</i>

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:33.840
<i>Then coke, Valium, Vicodin</i>

01:12:33.842 --> 01:12:35.508
<i>Percocet and more Adderall.</i>

01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:38.445
<i>I rented a penthouse apartment
and installed plasma screens</i>

01:12:38.447 --> 01:12:40.181
<i>for the sports bettors.</i>

01:12:40.183 --> 01:12:42.081
<i>I had the lower stakes
games on Wednesdays</i>

01:12:42.083 --> 01:12:44.051
<i>Thursdays and Sundays
at my place</i>

01:12:44.053 --> 01:12:46.786
<i>with Tuesday night at
the Plaza being the big game.</i>

01:12:46.788 --> 01:12:48.222
<i>At 7:00, the dealers came</i>

01:12:48.224 --> 01:12:49.956
<i>and the table was set up
and polished</i>

01:12:49.958 --> 01:12:51.525
<i>and ten chairs
were placed around it</i>

01:12:51.527 --> 01:12:53.960
<i>exactly 12 inches apart.</i>

01:12:53.962 --> 01:12:55.929
<i>I used custom chips
and two dealers</i>

01:12:55.931 --> 01:12:58.065
<i>who worked an hour on,
an hour off</i>

01:12:58.067 --> 01:13:01.302
<i>with a new crew coming in
after 12 hours.</i>

01:13:01.304 --> 01:13:03.137
<i>Casinos had discovered
that certain scents</i>

01:13:03.139 --> 01:13:05.505
<i>make people more likely
to place big bets.</i>

01:13:05.507 --> 01:13:08.776
<i>The Casinos pump those scents
in through the ventilation.</i>

01:13:08.778 --> 01:13:12.012
<i>I had custom candles made.</i>

01:13:12.014 --> 01:13:14.347
<i>I'd been working
with a new dealer named "B."</i>

01:13:14.349 --> 01:13:17.151
<i>Not like Beatrice,
just the initial.</i>

01:13:17.153 --> 01:13:18.953
<i>She'd been working in
trashy card rooms</i>

01:13:18.955 --> 01:13:21.158
<i>on the East Side
and we became friends.</i>

01:13:22.390 --> 01:13:23.691
Tone it down.

01:13:23.693 --> 01:13:25.996
The big players
don't like fast hands.

01:13:29.232 --> 01:13:31.831
Sarcastic dealing, cool.

01:13:31.833 --> 01:13:34.834
You got to do it,
not doing it is insanity.

01:13:34.836 --> 01:13:36.637
You must be able to see that.

01:13:36.639 --> 01:13:39.072
You've been stiffed four
or five times.

01:13:39.074 --> 01:13:41.575
You've got hundreds of thousands
on the street.

01:13:41.577 --> 01:13:44.044
That's money you're
never gonna see again.

01:13:44.046 --> 01:13:47.615
<i>B had been suggesting
it for a long time.</i>

01:13:47.617 --> 01:13:48.915
<i>She was suggesting it again</i>

01:13:48.917 --> 01:13:50.485
<i>because of an incident
the week before.</i>

01:13:50.487 --> 01:13:51.852
- Hey, Cole.
- Hey.

01:13:51.854 --> 01:13:54.488
- Come on in.
- Thanks, you got my check?

01:13:54.490 --> 01:13:56.456
<i>I do.</i>

01:13:56.458 --> 01:13:57.790
- It's right here.
- Thank you.

01:13:57.792 --> 01:13:59.192
Hey can I show you
something on TV?

01:13:59.194 --> 01:14:02.129
Umm, actually,
I'm in kinda a hurry.

01:14:02.131 --> 01:14:03.967
It'll just take a second.
Have a seat.

01:14:06.935 --> 01:14:09.535
This is last Tuesday's game.

01:14:09.537 --> 01:14:11.371
Shit, Molly,
if the guys find out

01:14:11.373 --> 01:14:14.275
you've got cameras on them,
they're gonna go nuts.

01:14:14.277 --> 01:14:16.343
Yeah, that's you
in the seventh chair.

01:14:16.345 --> 01:14:17.511
Look at your stack of chips.

01:14:17.513 --> 01:14:18.946
I've got a cab downstairs...

01:14:18.948 --> 01:14:22.383
Look at the time stamp.
1:06 a.m.

01:14:22.385 --> 01:14:23.984
<i>Let's fast forward to 1:07.</i>

01:14:23.986 --> 01:14:26.453
<i>1:07,
you lose a hand to Boosty.</i>

01:14:26.455 --> 01:14:28.688
- What is this?
- <i>1:08.</i>

01:14:28.690 --> 01:14:30.324
Our sheets say that
you didn't buy-in again

01:14:30.326 --> 01:14:31.825
<i>between 1:06 and 1:08.</i>

01:14:31.827 --> 01:14:33.960
<i>But look at that,
your stack's bigger.</i>

01:14:33.962 --> 01:14:36.396
- I can explain, it's just, uh...
- Okay, let's rewind.

01:14:36.398 --> 01:14:38.298
<i>This screen's got
the dealer changeover</i>

01:14:38.300 --> 01:14:40.668
<i>while at the same time,
on this screen</i>

01:14:40.670 --> 01:14:44.504
<i>and... there we are.</i>

01:14:44.506 --> 01:14:48.508
<i>This is why I can't reconcile
$57,000 from Tuesday's game.</i>

01:14:48.510 --> 01:14:51.078
A 7-11's got security cameras
on their slushy machine.

01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:52.780
I've got a million
dollars changing hands

01:14:52.782 --> 01:14:54.748
every two minutes, imbecile.

01:14:54.750 --> 01:14:56.886
You don't think
I've got eyes on the table?

01:14:59.354 --> 01:15:00.857
Relax.

01:15:03.992 --> 01:15:05.892
I, uh, I owe people money.

01:15:05.894 --> 01:15:08.227
I know. Why isn't it coming
from the trust fund?

01:15:08.229 --> 01:15:11.365
I need my parents' permission
to get that much.

01:15:11.367 --> 01:15:13.633
And they'd kill me. You don't
even understand what it's like.

01:15:13.635 --> 01:15:15.703
People don't realize
trust fund kids.

01:15:15.705 --> 01:15:16.837
Are suffering
in this economy, too.

01:15:16.839 --> 01:15:18.504
I realize what I did was wrong.

01:15:18.506 --> 01:15:20.773
Did it take a lot of soul
searching to get you there?

01:15:20.775 --> 01:15:22.176
Okay, okay, first of all

01:15:22.178 --> 01:15:23.643
the guys that are making
the counterfeit chips

01:15:23.645 --> 01:15:24.945
are taking you for a ride.

01:15:24.947 --> 01:15:26.347
They know that
there are signatures

01:15:26.349 --> 01:15:27.380
built into the chips.

01:15:27.382 --> 01:15:30.150
Exact weight, infrared markings.

01:15:30.152 --> 01:15:31.852
Breathe. Second.

01:15:31.854 --> 01:15:33.721
Don't try this
at anyone else's game

01:15:33.723 --> 01:15:35.254
because if you do,
they are going to express

01:15:35.256 --> 01:15:37.924
their anger in a much different
way than I am.

01:15:37.926 --> 01:15:39.660
You owe me $57,000.

01:15:39.662 --> 01:15:41.227
When I get it, you get the tape

01:15:41.229 --> 01:15:42.396
but until then

01:15:42.398 --> 01:15:44.530
you don't play in anyone's game.

01:15:44.532 --> 01:15:47.567
<i>So when Tuesday night
came, B was at it again.</i>

01:15:47.569 --> 01:15:49.436
Your exposure's crazy.

01:15:49.438 --> 01:15:51.571
It's not if, it's when.

01:15:51.573 --> 01:15:53.440
You're gonna get blown up.

01:15:53.442 --> 01:15:55.942
Your risk is nuts.

01:15:55.944 --> 01:15:58.379
If I took a rake, this game
would no longer be legal.

01:15:58.381 --> 01:16:02.348
And if you can't cover,
this game will no longer exist.

01:16:02.350 --> 01:16:04.118
You're the bank now.

01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:06.790
You're guaranteeing the game.

01:16:09.391 --> 01:16:10.723
If you see a hand

01:16:10.725 --> 01:16:12.191
you don't want to carry

01:16:12.193 --> 01:16:13.794
just look at me

01:16:13.796 --> 01:16:15.562
flash me a number

01:16:15.564 --> 01:16:17.801
and I'll take it off the table.

01:16:19.001 --> 01:16:22.703
Most runners cap it
at five percent.

01:16:22.705 --> 01:16:25.641
- I'll see you out there.
- See you out there.

01:16:43.826 --> 01:16:45.459
<i>Two weeks later, around 2 a.m.</i>

01:16:45.461 --> 01:16:48.928
<i>there was a pot that was up to
$1.3 million, pre-flop</i>

01:16:48.930 --> 01:16:52.165
<i>with five players still in.</i>

01:16:52.167 --> 01:16:55.902
<i>My hope was that the flop
would chase four of them off.</i>

01:16:55.904 --> 01:16:57.404
<i>$200,000.</i>

01:16:57.406 --> 01:16:59.208
<i>Raise a $100,000.</i>

01:17:01.911 --> 01:17:05.245
- $300,000 to you, sir.
- Call.

01:17:05.247 --> 01:17:08.418
<i>There was now 2.1
million on the table.</i>

01:17:11.353 --> 01:17:13.156
$300,000 to you, sir.

01:17:14.790 --> 01:17:16.022
Plus 200.

01:17:16.024 --> 01:17:17.693
<i>$2.6 million.</i>

01:17:24.766 --> 01:17:26.799
<i>Three million.</i>

01:17:26.801 --> 01:17:28.067
<i>She was right.</i>

01:17:28.069 --> 01:17:30.103
<i>I was extending credit.
Big numbers.</i>

01:17:30.105 --> 01:17:32.071
<i>And it's not like
Harlan Eustice hadn't already</i>

01:17:32.073 --> 01:17:34.208
<i>put the fear of God into me.</i>

01:17:34.210 --> 01:17:36.075
<i>If I couldn't pay one time</i>

01:17:36.077 --> 01:17:38.579
<i>that'd be the end of the game.</i>

01:17:38.581 --> 01:17:40.216
<i>I was the house.</i>

01:17:43.519 --> 01:17:46.018
<i>That's how quickly
I made the decision.</i>

01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:48.922
<i>And just as quickly, B
calculated 2 percent of the pot</i>

01:17:48.924 --> 01:17:50.760
<i>and took it off the table.</i>

01:17:53.194 --> 01:17:55.329
<i>That was it,
I had just taken a rake</i>

01:17:55.331 --> 01:17:59.868
<i>in violation of
U.S. Criminal Code, 1955.</i>

01:18:04.773 --> 01:18:06.740
<i>It's time to introduce
Douglas Downey</i>

01:18:06.742 --> 01:18:09.543
<i>'cause Downey's gonna
take us all the way home.</i>

01:18:09.545 --> 01:18:11.378
<i>Downey was a drunk,
and he'd stay after the game</i>

01:18:11.380 --> 01:18:14.013
<i>and hang out
while I did the books.</i>

01:18:14.015 --> 01:18:15.781
<i>He was hard to understand
when he was drunk</i>

01:18:15.783 --> 01:18:16.984
<i>and his conversation openers</i>

01:18:16.986 --> 01:18:18.051
<i>would always sound like</i>

01:18:18.053 --> 01:18:19.520
<i>the title of a detective novel.</i>

01:18:19.522 --> 01:18:22.321
Victim of circumstance.

01:18:22.323 --> 01:18:23.460
Yeah.

01:18:25.995 --> 01:18:28.861
Story of, you know...

01:18:28.863 --> 01:18:32.167
Story of my proverbial,
you know...

01:18:36.805 --> 01:18:39.505
- Life?
- Life.

01:18:39.507 --> 01:18:41.909
<i>He'd talk about his marriage.</i>

01:18:41.911 --> 01:18:44.777
I married young, Mol.

01:18:44.779 --> 01:18:47.313
I married young
and I married dull.

01:18:47.315 --> 01:18:51.486
If I'd been born in Greenwich
instead of Flushing...

01:18:51.488 --> 01:18:53.419
<i>He talked about
wanting a better life.</i>

01:18:53.421 --> 01:18:54.887
New Canaan...

01:18:54.889 --> 01:18:57.891
Gone to... Rye Country Day

01:18:57.893 --> 01:18:59.529
Princeton...

01:19:01.397 --> 01:19:02.465
The life I'd have.

01:19:03.698 --> 01:19:05.464
The wife I'd have?

01:19:05.466 --> 01:19:07.402
I'd be a player.

01:19:10.538 --> 01:19:12.407
Victim of circumstance.

01:19:15.911 --> 01:19:19.379
Mol, these are things
I only say to you.

01:19:19.381 --> 01:19:20.580
Good call.

01:19:20.582 --> 01:19:21.815
<i>And he'd talk about another</i>

01:19:21.817 --> 01:19:23.683
<i>game he played in.</i>

01:19:23.685 --> 01:19:25.084
<i>It was the Brooklyn game.</i>

01:19:25.086 --> 01:19:26.152
<i>The Brighton Beach game</i>

01:19:26.154 --> 01:19:27.387
<i>where they played all night</i>

01:19:27.389 --> 01:19:28.588
<i>and all day.</i>

01:19:28.590 --> 01:19:31.057
<i>The game that was
populated by Russians.</i>

01:19:31.059 --> 01:19:34.261
I'm the only Irish guy
they'll let play.

01:19:34.263 --> 01:19:37.798
Mol, these are the nicest
guys I've ever met.

01:19:37.800 --> 01:19:41.101
<i>Then one night, Douglas
Downey lost $80,000 at my game</i>

01:19:41.103 --> 01:19:42.401
<i>and didn't have it.</i>

01:19:42.403 --> 01:19:44.472
Winston, can I have
the room, please?

01:19:44.474 --> 01:19:45.739
Sure.

01:19:45.741 --> 01:19:47.243
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Mm.

01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:53.512
You won a $190,000 last week.

01:19:53.514 --> 01:19:57.417
- I owe Teddy Chin and Tutti...
- Right.

01:19:57.419 --> 01:19:58.919
And some sports bets.

01:19:58.921 --> 01:20:01.554
I'm a winner trapped
inside the body of a...

01:20:01.556 --> 01:20:03.789
- Stop.
- Yeah.

01:20:03.791 --> 01:20:06.058
The Brooklyn game.

01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:07.828
Is everything I've heard true?

01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:09.329
What have you heard?

01:20:09.331 --> 01:20:10.896
The Russian's have deep pockets

01:20:10.898 --> 01:20:12.298
bad at poker, give action

01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:14.301
pay instantly
and wear a coat and tie.

01:20:14.303 --> 01:20:15.572
It's all true.

01:20:19.774 --> 01:20:21.540
Bring me some of those players
and I'll give you

01:20:21.542 --> 01:20:24.578
a piece of the game
until your 80K is paid down.

01:20:24.580 --> 01:20:26.413
Loser is what I was gonna say.

01:20:26.415 --> 01:20:28.548
Winner trapped inside
the body of a...

01:20:28.550 --> 01:20:29.883
- I know. Got it.
- Loser.

01:20:29.885 --> 01:20:31.218
Can you bring me some players?

01:20:31.220 --> 01:20:33.553
I'm the only Irish guy
they'll let play.

01:20:33.555 --> 01:20:35.554
Do you understand the deal
I'm offering you?

01:20:35.556 --> 01:20:38.424
No, I'm saying this
because you're Irish

01:20:38.426 --> 01:20:40.427
and they may not want
to play in your game.

01:20:40.429 --> 01:20:42.728
I'm the only Irish guy
they'll let play.

01:20:42.730 --> 01:20:44.666
I'm not Irish.

01:20:46.769 --> 01:20:50.404
- You're not?
- No.

01:20:50.406 --> 01:20:51.637
Molly Bloom?

01:20:51.639 --> 01:20:53.976
You're thinking
of the James Joyce character.

01:20:55.778 --> 01:20:57.944
I always thought you were Irish.

01:20:57.946 --> 01:20:59.745
I'm not.
Can you bring me some players?

01:20:59.747 --> 01:21:01.147
Isn't there a famous book...

01:21:01.149 --> 01:21:02.782
Okay, Douglas, focus up.

01:21:02.784 --> 01:21:05.151
Yes, there's a book
by James Joyce called "Ulysses"

01:21:05.153 --> 01:21:06.453
and there's a character
named Molly Bloom

01:21:06.455 --> 01:21:07.920
and that is why
you think I'm Irish

01:21:07.922 --> 01:21:09.923
but now it's time
to move past that.

01:21:09.925 --> 01:21:12.262
Can you bring me
some Brighton Beach players?

01:21:15.064 --> 01:21:17.230
If you're not Irish,
what are you?

01:21:17.232 --> 01:21:19.365
I'm a Russian Jew.

01:21:19.367 --> 01:21:22.201
<i>The next week, I
had some new players.</i>

01:21:22.203 --> 01:21:23.570
<i>Mike was the first one
to arrive.</i>

01:21:23.572 --> 01:21:25.504
- I'm Jesse.
- I'm Mike Davidoff.

01:21:25.506 --> 01:21:27.240
<i>Mike owned a
chain of medical clinics</i>

01:21:27.242 --> 01:21:29.575
<i>and had already posted
with a wire transfer.</i>

01:21:29.577 --> 01:21:32.579
<i>Next were the Gershen brothers.
Illya and Alexei.</i>

01:21:32.581 --> 01:21:35.214
<i>They were in the business
of exporting steel to China.</i>

01:21:35.216 --> 01:21:37.284
<i>Alexei brought a quarter
of a million dollars</i>

01:21:37.286 --> 01:21:39.422
<i>in cash, in a backpack.</i>

01:21:40.522 --> 01:21:43.623
Mr. Habib, good evening.
I'm Shelby.

01:21:43.625 --> 01:21:46.459
I'm Shelly.
Only one letter's different.

01:21:46.461 --> 01:21:48.829
Also I'm a billionaire. I think
I may have seen you naked.

01:21:48.831 --> 01:21:51.298
No. You would remember.

01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:52.833
<i>And then Shelly Habib.</i>

01:21:52.835 --> 01:21:54.735
<i>The Habib family
owns the largest collection</i>

01:21:54.737 --> 01:21:58.405
<i>of classical art in the world,
valued at 3 billion dollars</i>

01:21:58.407 --> 01:22:00.139
<i>and Shelly runs
the Hallie Gallery</i>

01:22:00.141 --> 01:22:01.307
<i>on Madison Avenue.</i>

01:22:01.309 --> 01:22:02.875
As for tonight, I was not able

01:22:02.877 --> 01:22:04.210
to put my hands on cash today

01:22:04.212 --> 01:22:05.245
because I woke up this morning

01:22:05.247 --> 01:22:06.679
after the banks had closed.

01:22:06.681 --> 01:22:07.981
So I'm hoping you'll accept

01:22:07.983 --> 01:22:10.253
this as temporary collateral.

01:22:12.854 --> 01:22:16.188
That is an authentic Monet?

01:22:16.190 --> 01:22:19.058
Grabbed it right off the wall.

01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:21.294
You came over here
carrying a Monet?

01:22:21.296 --> 01:22:24.530
I was driven and I have security
outside the door.

01:22:24.532 --> 01:22:27.066
Okay, Shelly.
Here's what I need you to do.

01:22:27.068 --> 01:22:28.802
I need you to get this...

01:22:28.804 --> 01:22:30.102
- What, four?
- Seven.

01:22:30.104 --> 01:22:31.204
<i>Seven million dollar</i>

01:22:31.206 --> 01:22:32.539
painting out of here right now.

01:22:32.541 --> 01:22:34.708
- And you're, I assume, armed?
- Sure.

01:22:34.710 --> 01:22:37.177
<i>Security can't stand
in front of the door.</i>

01:22:37.179 --> 01:22:38.844
Fix this up, come on back

01:22:38.846 --> 01:22:42.081
and I'll extend you credit
tonight up to one and a half.

01:22:42.083 --> 01:22:44.116
You're a very
beautiful woman.

01:22:44.118 --> 01:22:45.518
Please be careful
with the painting.

01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:46.953
Always.

01:22:46.955 --> 01:22:49.490
<i>Mike, Illya,
Alexei and Shelly.</i>

01:22:49.492 --> 01:22:51.557
<i>Those were the players
Doug Downey brought me.</i>

01:22:51.559 --> 01:22:54.561
<i>As advertised,
they played loose, gave action</i>

01:22:54.563 --> 01:22:57.097
<i>lost to the regulars
and settled right away.</i>

01:22:57.099 --> 01:22:59.865
<i>People have asked,
"Wasn't there any way to tell</i>

01:22:59.867 --> 01:23:01.634
<i>"that some of the players
at your game were connected</i>

01:23:01.636 --> 01:23:03.469
<i>"to one of the darkest,
deadliest</i>

01:23:03.472 --> 01:23:06.772
<i>and far-reaching organized
crime syndicates in the world?"</i>

01:23:06.774 --> 01:23:09.075
<i>No. There wasn't.</i>

01:23:09.077 --> 01:23:11.114
I'm gonna go all in.

01:24:08.170 --> 01:24:10.637
I wish I had better news.

01:24:10.639 --> 01:24:13.440
Harrison Wellstone didn't go
for the minor role reduction?

01:24:13.442 --> 01:24:14.673
No.

01:24:14.675 --> 01:24:16.477
He didn't buy that
I was a cocktail waitress?

01:24:16.479 --> 01:24:19.579
- No.
- Aww. Is it because I wasn't?

01:24:19.581 --> 01:24:22.147
Hey, I tried, which is what
you're not paying me to do.

01:24:22.149 --> 01:24:23.483
So what now?

01:24:23.485 --> 01:24:24.817
The Government
is expressing an interest

01:24:24.819 --> 01:24:26.386
in you being
a cooperating witness.

01:24:26.388 --> 01:24:27.654
- You don't say?
- Molly.

01:24:27.656 --> 01:24:29.422
Who could've possibly seen that
coming?

01:24:29.424 --> 01:24:31.124
- Let's have the conversation.
- It will be short.

01:24:31.126 --> 01:24:32.726
Because I don't know anything
at all that can help them.

01:24:32.728 --> 01:24:34.361
You don't know anything that can
help them convict

01:24:34.363 --> 01:24:36.029
the Russians, but you
know things that can help them.

01:24:36.031 --> 01:24:38.498
Did you know that
97 percent of Federal cases

01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:39.732
never make it to trial?

01:24:39.734 --> 01:24:41.500
Even though the chances
of being convicted

01:24:41.502 --> 01:24:42.869
at trial is a little more than
one in a hundred?

01:24:42.871 --> 01:24:44.670
If you want to go
to trial, that's fine.

01:24:44.672 --> 01:24:47.039
But it's gonna cost you
in the area of $3,500,000

01:24:47.041 --> 01:24:49.109
Which the Justice Department
knows I don't have

01:24:49.111 --> 01:24:50.442
because they took
all of my money

01:24:50.444 --> 01:24:51.945
in a civil forfeiture
which they can do

01:24:51.947 --> 01:24:54.079
without a warrant,
because my property

01:24:54.081 --> 01:24:55.714
<i>doesn't have a presumption
of innocence.</i>

01:24:55.716 --> 01:24:57.984
Then after I'm arrested
by 17 agents

01:24:57.986 --> 01:25:00.387
holding automatic weapons,
totally necessary

01:25:00.389 --> 01:25:01.855
not at all meant
to intimidate me.

01:25:01.857 --> 01:25:03.889
I'm given two days
to hire a lawyer

01:25:03.891 --> 01:25:05.892
and appear in a courtroom on
the other side of the country.

01:25:05.894 --> 01:25:07.627
If you're saying
that everything that happens

01:25:07.629 --> 01:25:09.562
from the moment
you are arrested is designed

01:25:09.564 --> 01:25:11.565
to persuade you to plead guilty,
you are correct.

01:25:11.567 --> 01:25:13.266
So tell me all the ways
I can help

01:25:13.268 --> 01:25:14.935
'cause I really feel
I owe it to them.

01:25:14.937 --> 01:25:16.436
Oh, speaking of owing

01:25:16.438 --> 01:25:18.905
the IRS put a tax lien
on the money they took from me.

01:25:18.907 --> 01:25:21.474
Are you ki... Alright.
None of that matters.

01:25:21.476 --> 01:25:23.176
Taking my money wasn't a tax

01:25:23.178 --> 01:25:25.078
I also need
to give them my money.

01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:26.713
- Or they will take it again.
- None of that matters.

01:25:26.715 --> 01:25:28.447
- It needed to be said.
- Not really.

01:25:28.449 --> 01:25:30.349
So, to be clear, you're not
interested in entering

01:25:30.351 --> 01:25:31.884
a cooperation agreement
with the prosecutors?

01:25:31.886 --> 01:25:34.454
If I had testimony that would
lead to the conviction

01:25:34.456 --> 01:25:36.222
of a bad guy, no one would have

01:25:36.224 --> 01:25:37.891
<i>to coerce me into cooperating.</i>

01:25:37.893 --> 01:25:42.062
But I don't. I have dirt.
I have dish. I have gossip.

01:25:42.064 --> 01:25:43.495
So my value to the prosecution

01:25:43.497 --> 01:25:46.031
is exactly the same
as it is to Hollywood.

01:25:46.033 --> 01:25:49.169
I'm here to ensure the
New York Post covers the trial.

01:25:49.171 --> 01:25:50.469
I'm here to sell tickets.

01:25:50.472 --> 01:25:52.705
Which is nonetheless
value to the prosecution.

01:25:52.707 --> 01:25:55.141
So what we do
is leverage it to get

01:25:55.143 --> 01:25:56.610
you a favorable sentencing
recommendation

01:25:56.612 --> 01:26:00.012
or, better yet,
complete immunity. What?

01:26:00.014 --> 01:26:01.615
Oh. Hey, honey.

01:26:01.617 --> 01:26:03.586
- Hey, Stella.
- Hey.

01:26:04.152 --> 01:26:05.185
Hey.

01:26:05.187 --> 01:26:06.585
What does he have you doing now?

01:26:06.587 --> 01:26:07.920
An essay on three poems

01:26:07.922 --> 01:26:09.588
with what he believes
are a common theme.

01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:11.924
Not an essay. Two paragraphs.

01:26:11.926 --> 01:26:14.427
- Which three poems?
- Close, Rush and Walls.

01:26:14.429 --> 01:26:17.396
Oh, I know those.
What's the common theme?

01:26:17.398 --> 01:26:18.932
Things with one word titles.

01:26:18.934 --> 01:26:20.967
Are you sure you're qualified
to be teaching poetry?

01:26:20.969 --> 01:26:22.901
Hang on... And yes.

01:26:22.903 --> 01:26:25.771
Anytime you wanna run away from
home, you can come live with me.

01:26:25.773 --> 01:26:27.673
<i>Then you'll discover
she doesn't have a home</i>

01:26:27.675 --> 01:26:30.009
and you'll come back to me.

01:26:30.011 --> 01:26:31.544
This is good. Great.

01:26:31.546 --> 01:26:33.312
Why don't you grab a snack
and start your homework

01:26:33.314 --> 01:26:34.347
in one of the conference rooms?

01:26:34.349 --> 01:26:35.914
Okay. See ya.

01:26:35.916 --> 01:26:37.750
There's no law that says you
can't just hit him in the head.

01:26:37.752 --> 01:26:39.386
There is a law that says that,
it's the first thing

01:26:39.388 --> 01:26:40.786
I taught her to read.

01:26:40.788 --> 01:26:41.857
Go.

01:26:47.763 --> 01:26:50.562
My father used
to give us extra work.

01:26:50.564 --> 01:26:52.598
Can I ask you a question?

01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:55.067
You think I'm too hard on her?

01:26:55.069 --> 01:26:58.170
I met a girl when I first moved
to L.A., she was 22.

01:26:58.172 --> 01:27:00.339
Someone arranged through
a third party

01:27:00.341 --> 01:27:01.641
to spend the weekend
with her in London.

01:27:01.643 --> 01:27:02.976
You know what she got?

01:27:02.978 --> 01:27:05.210
For a weekend? Five grand.

01:27:05.212 --> 01:27:08.615
A bag. A Chanel bag she wanted.

01:27:08.617 --> 01:27:12.355
Whatever you're doing
with Stella, double it.

01:27:19.661 --> 01:27:21.797
Where's your father in all this?

01:27:24.166 --> 01:27:25.964
You mean, physically?

01:27:25.966 --> 01:27:28.603
He's in Colorado.

01:27:31.006 --> 01:27:32.905
Your parents still together?

01:27:32.907 --> 01:27:34.441
No.

01:27:34.443 --> 01:27:36.910
You and your father close?

01:27:36.912 --> 01:27:38.143
No.

01:27:38.145 --> 01:27:40.713
Was he tough on you?

01:27:40.715 --> 01:27:42.347
You know how many girls
at the Olympics

01:27:42.349 --> 01:27:43.950
have demanding fathers?

01:27:43.952 --> 01:27:46.856
- All of them?
- <i>Well, that's right.</i>

01:27:49.623 --> 01:27:52.191
I was tough on him.

01:27:52.193 --> 01:27:53.759
What do you mean?

01:27:53.761 --> 01:27:56.329
Um...

01:27:56.331 --> 01:27:58.701
I was a brat.

01:28:01.502 --> 01:28:03.406
<i>Fathers don't care.</i>

01:28:05.139 --> 01:28:08.641
- I'd start fights with him.
- <i>Why?</i>

01:28:08.643 --> 01:28:11.044
<i>You're lying!</i>

01:28:11.046 --> 01:28:12.879
<i>Why would I
start fights with him?</i>

01:28:12.881 --> 01:28:14.446
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:28:14.448 --> 01:28:16.050
<i>I put you through grad school!</i>

01:28:17.919 --> 01:28:19.487
I raised the kids.

01:28:19.489 --> 01:28:23.623
I did every... God, everything!

01:28:23.625 --> 01:28:24.691
No.

01:28:24.693 --> 01:28:26.426
No, you listen to me.

01:28:26.428 --> 01:28:28.628
All you do is cheat on me,
and lie to me

01:28:28.630 --> 01:28:30.466
and lie to the kids!

01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:34.370
You lie to your wife
and you lie to your kids.

01:28:37.005 --> 01:28:38.940
I don't know.

01:28:41.742 --> 01:28:44.276
For the record, the law in 1955

01:28:44.278 --> 01:28:47.045
that I'm accused of breaking it,
defines gambling as betting

01:28:47.047 --> 01:28:48.714
on games of chance.

01:28:48.716 --> 01:28:50.415
- Yes.
- Poker isn't a game of chance.

01:28:50.417 --> 01:28:52.584
Roulette's a game of chance.

01:28:52.586 --> 01:28:56.422
- Poker's a game of skill.
- <i>Still, I me...</i>

01:28:56.424 --> 01:28:58.761
I'll tell them everything
they want to know about me.

01:29:00.996 --> 01:29:02.931
About me.

01:29:03.998 --> 01:29:05.934
That's it.

01:29:09.738 --> 01:29:11.804
<i>Remember Bad Brad Marion?</i>

01:29:11.806 --> 01:29:14.540
<i>It turns out his $700,000,000
hedge fund</i>

01:29:14.542 --> 01:29:17.110
<i>wasn't what you would
call... real.</i>

01:29:17.112 --> 01:29:18.745
<i>It was a Ponzi scheme.</i>

01:29:18.747 --> 01:29:20.879
<i>He'd been falsely reporting
profits for years.</i>

01:29:20.881 --> 01:29:23.081
<i>He wasn't even registered
with the SEC.</i>

01:29:23.083 --> 01:29:25.118
<i>With the money given to him
by friends and family</i>

01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:27.085
<i>and players at the game,
he bought several</i>

01:29:27.087 --> 01:29:28.454
<i>Malibu Beach Houses</i>

01:29:28.456 --> 01:29:30.190
<i>an airplane hanger
full of cars</i>

01:29:30.192 --> 01:29:33.159
<i>another one with an airplane,
and a life he wanted.</i>

01:29:33.161 --> 01:29:36.228
<i>When he was arrested,
he had $740 in the bank.</i>

01:29:36.230 --> 01:29:38.764
<i>Brad cooperated with the FBI
and gave them hours</i>

01:29:38.766 --> 01:29:40.999
<i>of testimony
on a range of subjects.</i>

01:29:41.001 --> 01:29:42.634
<i>Including how three years
earlier</i>

01:29:42.636 --> 01:29:44.803
<i>he lost $5,200,000</i>

01:29:44.805 --> 01:29:46.806
<i>in an underground
celebrity poker game</i>

01:29:46.808 --> 01:29:49.275
<i>that was run by a girl
named Molly Bloom.</i>

01:29:49.277 --> 01:29:50.610
<i>His story was that
I had induced him</i>

01:29:50.612 --> 01:29:52.312
<i>to play in a high stakes game.</i>

01:29:52.314 --> 01:29:53.913
I just wanted to introduce you
to Brad Marion.

01:29:53.915 --> 01:29:55.347
<i>And that due to my enabling</i>

01:29:55.349 --> 01:29:56.682
<i>he'd become a gambling addict.</i>

01:29:56.684 --> 01:29:58.750
...who made me
become a gambling addict.

01:29:58.752 --> 01:30:00.152
Brad, this game might
not be for you.

01:30:00.154 --> 01:30:01.721
<i>Federal Bankruptcy lawyers</i>

01:30:01.723 --> 01:30:03.088
<i>were brought in to recover
as much</i>

01:30:03.090 --> 01:30:05.124
<i>of the boosted money
as they could.</i>

01:30:05.126 --> 01:30:08.261
<i>I was sent a subpoena and flew
out to L.A. to be deposed.</i>

01:30:08.263 --> 01:30:10.530
Can you confirm
the names on the list

01:30:10.532 --> 01:30:12.598
all played poker
with Brad Marion?

01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:14.601
This list was provided
to you by Brad Marion?

01:30:14.603 --> 01:30:16.102
I just need you
to confirm for the record

01:30:16.104 --> 01:30:18.170
that your game included
but was not limited to...

01:30:18.172 --> 01:30:20.772
I understand, what I'm trying
to get on the record is that

01:30:20.774 --> 01:30:23.709
I'm not the one
who provided the list.

01:30:23.711 --> 01:30:26.247
These names were provided
by Brad Marion.

01:30:27.648 --> 01:30:30.083
<i>So, under oath...</i>

01:30:30.085 --> 01:30:33.419
Yes. I can confirm
the list is accurate.

01:30:33.421 --> 01:30:35.888
<i>The L.A. players
and I were given a choice.</i>

01:30:35.890 --> 01:30:38.357
<i>Testify against each other
in open court</i>

01:30:38.359 --> 01:30:42.094
<i>or help make restitution to the
victims of Brad's Ponzi scheme.</i>

01:30:42.096 --> 01:30:45.298
<i>I wrote the government
a check for $500,000 dollars.</i>

01:30:45.300 --> 01:30:48.368
<i>And somewhere in an FBI field
office in New York</i>

01:30:48.370 --> 01:30:51.207
<i>someone was pinning
my picture to a wall.</i>

01:30:52.674 --> 01:30:54.273
<i>I was running six games a week</i>

01:30:54.275 --> 01:30:56.910
<i>sometimes at two different
locations in a night.</i>

01:30:56.912 --> 01:31:00.346
<i>And by this point,
I was addicted to drugs.</i>

01:31:00.348 --> 01:31:02.615
<i>Adderall. Ambien. Xanax. Coke.</i>

01:31:02.617 --> 01:31:05.651
<i>Alcohol, Valium,
Ativan, Trazadone.</i>

01:31:05.653 --> 01:31:08.821
<i>Anything that could keep me up
for a few days</i>

01:31:08.823 --> 01:31:11.293
<i>and knock me out
for a few hours.</i>

01:31:13.995 --> 01:31:17.163
<i>But I wasn't just taking them
to stay awake anymore.</i>

01:31:17.165 --> 01:31:21.334
<i>It was dark and friendless
where I was.</i>

01:31:21.336 --> 01:31:24.570
<i>I felt like I was in a hole
so deep, I could go fracking.</i>

01:31:24.572 --> 01:31:28.273
<i>It didn't feel like depression,
it felt more violent.</i>

01:31:29.743 --> 01:31:31.410
<i>I was tired of living
in the frat house</i>

01:31:31.412 --> 01:31:33.012
<i>I'd built for degenerates.</i>

01:31:33.014 --> 01:31:35.380
<i>I was tired of the greed.</i>

01:31:35.382 --> 01:31:38.317
<i>Mine, not theirs. Everybody's.</i>

01:31:38.319 --> 01:31:40.253
<i>I was sick
of being high all the time.</i>

01:31:40.255 --> 01:31:42.521
<i>I was sick
of living in the grey area.</i>

01:31:42.523 --> 01:31:44.123
<i>I couldn't recognize myself</i>

01:31:44.125 --> 01:31:46.629
<i>and what I recognized,
I couldn't stand.</i>

01:31:48.162 --> 01:31:50.896
<i>After a game one night,
Douglas Downey surprised me</i>

01:31:50.898 --> 01:31:52.664
<i>with a confession,
after opening</i>

01:31:52.666 --> 01:31:54.467
<i>with another
detective story title.</i>

01:31:54.469 --> 01:31:56.736
Gut shot on the river.

01:31:56.738 --> 01:31:59.105
- I want to say something.
- Okay.

01:31:59.107 --> 01:32:03.075
- I want to say, um, something.
- Okay.

01:32:03.077 --> 01:32:05.277
- I'm just gonna say...
- Cool.

01:32:05.279 --> 01:32:09.848
Because there's a poem,
a famous, uh...

01:32:09.850 --> 01:32:12.685
A poem about...

01:32:12.687 --> 01:32:15.088
thoughts left unexpressed.

01:32:15.090 --> 01:32:18.827
Two roads emerged
from the woods.

01:32:20.127 --> 01:32:22.063
Do they explode?

01:32:23.198 --> 01:32:26.365
I don't know.
Do you like poetry?

01:32:26.367 --> 01:32:28.000
I did until a second ago.
I'm gonna call you...

01:32:28.002 --> 01:32:30.139
I'm, I'm in love with you.

01:32:32.340 --> 01:32:35.340
- This isn't happening.
- Plain and simple.

01:32:35.342 --> 01:32:37.810
You're the woman
I've always dreamed of

01:32:37.812 --> 01:32:39.078
and I've been dreaming...

01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:41.280
Shh. Stop it.
Listen to me, Douglas.

01:32:41.282 --> 01:32:43.682
I'm the woman all of you
have always dreamed of.

01:32:43.684 --> 01:32:46.651
I'm the anti-wife.
I encourage your gambling.

01:32:46.653 --> 01:32:48.187
I have drinks served
to you by models

01:32:48.189 --> 01:32:50.655
who simultaneously
create the impression

01:32:50.657 --> 01:32:52.325
that you're the kind of guy
who can score

01:32:52.327 --> 01:32:53.825
a dime piece anytime you want.

01:32:53.827 --> 01:32:56.396
It's nice for you in here.

01:32:56.398 --> 01:32:58.530
Do you know who Circe was?

01:32:58.532 --> 01:33:02.200
- Uh...
- Circe?

01:33:02.202 --> 01:33:04.003
Used to play
in Teddy Chin's game?

01:33:04.005 --> 01:33:07.240
Nope. Circe did not play
in Teddy's game.

01:33:07.242 --> 01:33:09.142
She was the Greek goddess
of magic.

01:33:09.144 --> 01:33:12.145
And she gave men feasts
with wine and honey

01:33:12.147 --> 01:33:14.079
and then turned them into swine.

01:33:14.081 --> 01:33:17.849
- Why?
- Fantastic question.

01:33:17.851 --> 01:33:20.719
I would never do that to you.

01:33:20.721 --> 01:33:23.021
Missed the point by miles,
but that's okay.

01:33:23.023 --> 01:33:25.157
Oh.

01:33:25.159 --> 01:33:26.825
Um, Molly.

01:33:26.827 --> 01:33:30.362
Shelby and Winston
will close up.

01:33:30.364 --> 01:33:32.001
I'll see you next week.

01:33:37.705 --> 01:33:39.672
Here you go,
thanks a lot, Randy.

01:33:39.674 --> 01:33:41.106
Thanks, Molly.

01:33:41.108 --> 01:33:43.942
- Good morning.
- Morning, Pat.

01:33:43.944 --> 01:33:47.579
<i>Pat was my driver and security.</i>

01:33:47.581 --> 01:33:49.414
- Straight home?
- Yeah.

01:33:49.416 --> 01:33:51.017
<i>We didn't know
much more about each other</i>

01:33:51.019 --> 01:33:53.319
<i>than we needed to know,
but I liked him.</i>

01:33:53.321 --> 01:33:55.256
<i>We were friends.</i>

01:34:00.961 --> 01:34:04.931
I used to be
a competitive athlete.

01:34:04.933 --> 01:34:06.398
I didn't know if you knew that.

01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:08.534
What sport?

01:34:08.536 --> 01:34:10.602
Skiing.

01:34:10.604 --> 01:34:12.838
Freestyle.

01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:14.976
<i>Were you good?</i>

01:34:16.911 --> 01:34:19.047
I don't know.

01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:27.820
- Hey, Molly.
- <i>Pat asked me a favor.</i>

01:34:27.822 --> 01:34:29.888
<i>He said there were a
couple of hedge fund guys</i>

01:34:29.890 --> 01:34:31.523
<i>in New Jersey
who wanted to play</i>

01:34:31.525 --> 01:34:33.558
<i>and he could score points
with them if he was able</i>

01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:34.826
<i>to get them a meeting with me.</i>

01:34:34.828 --> 01:34:36.495
<i>I said, "Sure," and set
the meeting</i>

01:34:36.497 --> 01:34:39.598
<i>for 5 p.m. on a Thursday
at the Four Seasons Bar.</i>

01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:41.299
<i>Knowing that if they were legit</i>

01:34:41.301 --> 01:34:43.436
<i>they'd recognize someone
in the crowd at happy hour</i>

01:34:43.438 --> 01:34:45.571
<i>at the Four Seasons right after
the closing bell.</i>

01:34:45.573 --> 01:34:48.141
<i>It turns out I didn't
need to be that clever.</i>

01:34:48.143 --> 01:34:49.875
<i>These weren't finance guys.</i>

01:34:49.877 --> 01:34:51.710
<i>They were from the cast
of "Jersey Boys."</i>

01:34:51.712 --> 01:34:53.846
<i>They looked around the bar
self-consciously.</i>

01:34:53.848 --> 01:34:55.213
<i>They were out of their element.</i>

01:34:55.215 --> 01:34:56.749
<i>And tough guys
try to look tougher</i>

01:34:56.751 --> 01:34:58.116
<i>when they're insecure.</i>

01:34:58.118 --> 01:34:59.451
<i>I had a good hunch
what they wanted</i>

01:34:59.453 --> 01:35:01.053
<i>and I was gonna have
to shut down</i>

01:35:01.055 --> 01:35:02.922
<i>this meeting quickly,
but without being rude</i>

01:35:02.924 --> 01:35:05.324
<i>to Joey Bag-a-Donuts
and Secaucus Sal.</i>

01:35:05.326 --> 01:35:06.959
I'm Molly Bloom.
Nice to meet you.

01:35:06.961 --> 01:35:08.628
- John G.
- And you are?

01:35:08.630 --> 01:35:10.299
Paul.

01:35:11.366 --> 01:35:13.999
<i>How do we get a drink?</i>

01:35:14.001 --> 01:35:15.968
<i>I don't remember
what the other guy ordered</i>

01:35:15.970 --> 01:35:17.370
<i>but I'll never forget
what John G had.</i>

01:35:17.372 --> 01:35:19.004
<i>He looked at the waiter
as if to say</i>

01:35:19.006 --> 01:35:20.438
<i>that he could handle
himself just fine</i>

01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:22.441
<i>among the Manhattan elite
and said...</i>

01:35:22.443 --> 01:35:24.379
I'll have an Appletini.

01:35:25.979 --> 01:35:28.213
- Okay.
- So, how was your week?

01:35:28.215 --> 01:35:31.551
My week? Uh, it was fine.
Thank you.

01:35:31.553 --> 01:35:36.054
Pat said you guys might
be interested in a game?

01:35:36.056 --> 01:35:38.824
We want to partner
with you.

01:35:38.826 --> 01:35:41.326
- We've talked to Tutti, Will...
- Teddy Chin.

01:35:41.328 --> 01:35:42.628
Teddy Chin.

01:35:42.630 --> 01:35:44.996
We did a little work
with them too.

01:35:44.998 --> 01:35:47.135
We can make
your life easier.

01:35:49.002 --> 01:35:51.536
Nobody will fuck with you.

01:35:51.538 --> 01:35:53.475
Nobody will stiff you.

01:35:56.443 --> 01:36:01.246
I appreciate the offer,
but really, I'm fine.

01:36:01.248 --> 01:36:04.049
I don't carry a big debt sheet.
I feel safe.

01:36:04.051 --> 01:36:07.119
Ah-uh, you lied just then

01:36:07.121 --> 01:36:09.454
when you said you don't carry
a big debt sheet.

01:36:09.456 --> 01:36:11.790
You've got 2.8 million
on the street right now

01:36:11.792 --> 01:36:13.426
<i>right as we're sitting here.</i>

01:36:13.428 --> 01:36:15.061
We do our research.

01:36:15.063 --> 01:36:17.062
That money should be
in your hands.

01:36:17.064 --> 01:36:20.833
'Cause it's yours. It's yours.

01:36:20.835 --> 01:36:22.200
And if you don't have it,
you got

01:36:22.202 --> 01:36:24.339
to go into your pocket
to pay the wins.

01:36:25.939 --> 01:36:28.007
Fellas, I'm sorry.

01:36:28.009 --> 01:36:31.009
It's just a friendly game
with higher stakes.

01:36:31.011 --> 01:36:32.911
It was really nice
to meet you though.

01:36:32.913 --> 01:36:35.213
Let me know if there's ever
anything I can do for you.

01:36:35.215 --> 01:36:37.249
I like to do favors.

01:36:37.251 --> 01:36:39.919
They'll put your drinks
on my card.

01:36:39.921 --> 01:36:41.587
<i>There are some
gaps in my memory</i>

01:36:41.589 --> 01:36:43.255
<i>which they say is common
when you've had</i>

01:36:43.257 --> 01:36:44.624
<i>what's called, an event.</i>

01:36:44.626 --> 01:36:46.459
<i>For instance, I don't remember
where I was</i>

01:36:46.461 --> 01:36:48.628
<i>coming from when I walked
into my building.</i>

01:36:48.630 --> 01:36:50.629
<i>Just that my doorman, Reggie,
said he had packages for me.</i>

01:36:50.631 --> 01:36:51.864
Ms. Bloom, I think
I got some things

01:36:51.866 --> 01:36:52.964
for you in the package room.

01:36:52.966 --> 01:36:54.532
- I'll bring them on up.
- Thanks.

01:36:54.534 --> 01:36:56.035
<i>It was the first
night of two weeks off</i>

01:36:56.037 --> 01:36:57.902
<i>for Christmas and New Year's.</i>

01:36:57.904 --> 01:37:02.141
<i>And my plan was to take a bath
and try not to take drugs.</i>

01:37:02.143 --> 01:37:04.576
<i>Reggie came up
with my packages.</i>

01:37:08.315 --> 01:37:11.182
Ahh, I'm sorry,
you're in the wrong...

01:37:11.184 --> 01:37:13.287
Wait! Okay, hold on a second,
I have...

01:37:18.025 --> 01:37:19.661
Not a sound.

01:37:23.531 --> 01:37:24.829
Do you hear me?

01:37:24.831 --> 01:37:26.731
I have money. It's all cash.

01:37:26.733 --> 01:37:29.035
- Where?
- S-safe.

01:37:29.037 --> 01:37:30.369
Where is it?

01:37:30.371 --> 01:37:32.574
- It's in the closet.
- Show me.

01:37:50.425 --> 01:37:52.928
Put the money
and jewelry in a bag.

01:38:01.836 --> 01:38:03.972
Gold bars too.

01:38:12.913 --> 01:38:13.978
Come on.

01:38:13.980 --> 01:38:17.549
Open your mouth.
Open your mouth.

01:38:17.551 --> 01:38:21.387
It wasn't an offer they made.
It wasn't a suggestion.

01:38:21.389 --> 01:38:24.389
This will be
your only reminder.

01:38:24.391 --> 01:38:29.331
Your mother lives alone
in Telluride, Colorado. Right?

01:38:31.765 --> 01:38:35.069
Right? Right, Molly?

01:38:36.037 --> 01:38:37.469
She doesn't live there anymore.

01:38:37.472 --> 01:38:39.407
Yes, she does.

01:39:41.101 --> 01:39:44.870
<i>I couldn't call a
doctor or go to an E.R.</i>

01:39:44.872 --> 01:39:47.409
<i>They'd take one look at me
and call the police.</i>

01:39:54.483 --> 01:39:57.383
<i>My eyes were swollen and black.</i>

01:39:57.385 --> 01:40:00.151
<i>My lips were cut and bloody.</i>

01:40:00.153 --> 01:40:02.290
<i>I couldn't feel my face.</i>

01:40:40.627 --> 01:40:42.628
<i>Pat had set up the meeting</i>

01:40:42.630 --> 01:40:45.132
<i>and he was how they knew
where I lived.</i>

01:40:48.034 --> 01:40:50.369
<i>I stayed in my apartment
for two weeks</i>

01:40:50.371 --> 01:40:52.338
<i>waiting for my face to heal...</i>

01:40:52.340 --> 01:40:55.177
<i>and waiting for the phone call
I knew was coming.</i>

01:40:56.577 --> 01:40:58.944
<i>But the call didn't come.</i>

01:40:58.946 --> 01:41:01.379
<i>Where was the call from John G?</i>

01:41:01.381 --> 01:41:03.684
<i>"So maybe you've had
a change of heart?"</i>

01:41:06.687 --> 01:41:09.824
<i>After ten days, I opened my
front door for the first time.</i>

01:41:12.859 --> 01:41:15.694
<i>People were coming back into
town after New Years in Cabo</i>

01:41:15.696 --> 01:41:18.199
<i>and St. Bart's,
and South Beach.</i>

01:41:20.100 --> 01:41:23.636
<i>My phone was blowing up with,
"When's the next game?"</i>

01:41:23.638 --> 01:41:25.774
<i>But nothing from John G.</i>

01:41:27.475 --> 01:41:29.674
<i>And then right there
on the front page</i>

01:41:29.676 --> 01:41:33.012
<i>of the New York Times
from eight days ago...</i>

01:41:33.014 --> 01:41:36.851
<i>nearly a 125 arrested
in sweeping mob roundup.</i>

01:41:38.152 --> 01:41:40.218
<i>Those guys
were either laying low</i>

01:41:40.220 --> 01:41:42.353
<i>or they were in custody.</i>

01:41:42.355 --> 01:41:44.826
<i>Sometimes God happens fast.</i>

01:41:47.260 --> 01:41:49.460
<i>My face had healed enough,
so that a little make-up</i>

01:41:49.462 --> 01:41:51.666
<i>would cover the bruises
that were left.</i>

01:41:52.867 --> 01:41:55.200
<i>I put together
a week of games.</i>

01:41:55.202 --> 01:41:58.603
<i>One week of games to get
the 2.8 million I was owed</i>

01:41:58.605 --> 01:42:01.507
<i>and then I was out, I was done.</i>

01:42:01.509 --> 01:42:04.375
<i>One week of epic games.</i>

01:42:04.377 --> 01:42:06.277
<i>I had some of my
London players in town</i>

01:42:06.279 --> 01:42:08.813
<i>and the Russians had
visiting friends from Moscow.</i>

01:42:08.815 --> 01:42:11.683
<i>Jesse and Shelby had already
started the game at the Plaza</i>

01:42:11.685 --> 01:42:14.419
<i>and were reporting
heavy early action.</i>

01:42:14.421 --> 01:42:17.056
<i>I was on my way
when the phone rang.</i>

01:42:17.058 --> 01:42:19.194
<i>It was Douglas Downey.</i>

01:42:20.394 --> 01:42:21.960
I'm on my way, Doug.

01:42:21.962 --> 01:42:24.762
<i>Wait, Molly. Wait.</i>

01:42:24.764 --> 01:42:26.464
<i>I'm hiding in the bathroom.</i>

01:42:26.466 --> 01:42:28.232
<i>I just... I-I need you
to believe me, okay?</i>

01:42:28.234 --> 01:42:29.668
- <i>I just...</i>
- Whose bathroom?

01:42:29.670 --> 01:42:31.169
<i>I need you to believe me
because, uh...</i>

01:42:31.171 --> 01:42:33.438
<i>Uh, at the suite, at the plaza.</i>

01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:34.839
Why are you hiding
in the bathroom?

01:42:34.841 --> 01:42:37.508
<i>I would never tell them
anything about you.</i>

01:42:37.510 --> 01:42:39.777
<i>I said, "Guys,
you want me to go further</i>

01:42:39.779 --> 01:42:42.981
<i>"you want me to go other
places, I'll do it.</i>

01:42:42.983 --> 01:42:46.486
<i>"But nothing about Molly,
she can't be touched.</i>

01:42:46.488 --> 01:42:48.821
- <i>Just the Russians."</i>
- Okay, you're drunk.

01:42:48.823 --> 01:42:51.022
And a little difficult
to understand

01:42:51.024 --> 01:42:52.958
so I'll see you in a few minutes
when I get there.

01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:54.994
<i>I was, uh...</i>

01:42:54.996 --> 01:42:57.632
<i>I was... uh...</i>

01:42:59.567 --> 01:43:02.234
<i>I was cited
for securities fraud.</i>

01:43:02.236 --> 01:43:03.901
<i>It was scrubbed from my record.</i>

01:43:03.903 --> 01:43:06.571
- <i>That's why you don't know.</i>
- Did you say Securities Fraud?

01:43:06.573 --> 01:43:08.606
<i>I would never help them
build a case against you</i>

01:43:08.608 --> 01:43:12.044
<i>I would have never give them
anything against you</i>

01:43:12.046 --> 01:43:14.579
<i>I'd commit perjury
before I did that.</i>

01:43:14.581 --> 01:43:17.348
<i>It was such bullshit,
it was 2006.</i>

01:43:17.350 --> 01:43:18.917
If you'd had an arrest,
I would've known.

01:43:18.919 --> 01:43:21.186
- <i>It was bullshit!</i>
- Doug.

01:43:21.188 --> 01:43:22.954
<i>I told them I'll go further</i>

01:43:22.956 --> 01:43:26.424
<i>I'll go other places,
but not you.</i>

01:43:26.426 --> 01:43:28.293
<i>I love you, I, I love...</i>

01:43:28.295 --> 01:43:30.762
Doug, listen, I-I need you to
pull it together for a second.

01:43:30.764 --> 01:43:32.964
Did they scrub your record,
because you've been informing?

01:43:32.966 --> 01:43:35.767
<i>Should I...
Should I have told you?</i>

01:43:35.769 --> 01:43:38.971
<i>That's a question that'll,
that'll haunt me for all my...</i>

01:43:38.973 --> 01:43:40.371
Why are you hiding
in the bathroom?

01:43:40.373 --> 01:43:42.508
<i>...for my days, Molly.</i>

01:43:42.510 --> 01:43:46.512
<i>Always know that I was
trying to protect you.</i>

01:43:46.514 --> 01:43:50.018
<i>Five blocks away,
the FBI had raided my game.</i>

01:44:08.635 --> 01:44:10.134
<i>I fully expected the lobby
to be filled</i>

01:44:10.136 --> 01:44:12.137
<i>with guys wearing windbreakers,
but it wasn't.</i>

01:44:12.139 --> 01:44:14.205
<i>Ms. Bloom. Haven't
seen you for a while.</i>

01:44:14.207 --> 01:44:16.510
- Yeah.
- You need a cab?

01:44:22.382 --> 01:44:25.584
I guess you never made it
upstairs with the packages.

01:44:25.586 --> 01:44:28.423
Maybe I didn't tip you enough
before Christmas.

01:44:31.458 --> 01:44:34.093
<i>Then you got into
a cab, took the cab to JFK</i>

01:44:34.095 --> 01:44:35.761
<i>and flew to your mother's house
in Denver.</i>

01:44:35.763 --> 01:44:37.062
<i>Telluride.</i>

01:44:37.064 --> 01:44:38.896
My mother lives in Telluride.

01:44:38.898 --> 01:44:40.932
- That was two years ago.
- Mm-hmm.

01:44:40.934 --> 01:44:42.534
In a cab on the way
to the airport

01:44:42.536 --> 01:44:44.602
I checked
my bank account balance.

01:44:44.604 --> 01:44:46.304
There should've had a little
over four million dollars

01:44:46.306 --> 01:44:49.575
but instead, it said the balance
was zero, and there was a note

01:44:49.577 --> 01:44:51.677
telling me to contact
the Justice Department.

01:44:51.679 --> 01:44:54.312
I just want to mention that she
also voluntarily checked herself

01:44:54.314 --> 01:44:57.849
into 28-day rehab and has been
sober and clean for two years.

01:44:57.851 --> 01:45:00.886
I don't care. Were the women
that worked for you call girls?

01:45:00.888 --> 01:45:02.053
No, sir.

01:45:02.055 --> 01:45:03.422
<i>They never exchanged
sex for money?</i>

01:45:03.424 --> 01:45:04.722
No.

01:45:04.724 --> 01:45:06.023
Have you ever exchanged
sex for money?

01:45:06.025 --> 01:45:08.093
- <i>No.</i>
- I think he was talking to me.

01:45:08.095 --> 01:45:10.161
I meant, no, she's not
answering that question.

01:45:10.163 --> 01:45:11.963
- <i>The purpose of this meeting...</i>
- I know.

01:45:11.965 --> 01:45:13.365
- Purpose of this meeting...
- <i>We're off the record.</i>

01:45:13.367 --> 01:45:14.465
We're not off the record.

01:45:14.467 --> 01:45:16.168
Do you see
a stenographer in here?

01:45:16.170 --> 01:45:17.969
We're off the record in
as much as there is no record

01:45:17.971 --> 01:45:19.838
but you're free to use
the information you're given

01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:21.973
and we're not giving
the information for free.

01:45:21.975 --> 01:45:23.909
I've been sitting at this table
for five hours

01:45:23.911 --> 01:45:26.745
waiting for the opportunity
to implore you to do

01:45:26.747 --> 01:45:30.081
the right thing while begging my
client for the last three weeks

01:45:30.083 --> 01:45:31.849
to act in her own
best interest.

01:45:31.851 --> 01:45:34.119
Neither of those things
should be hard.

01:45:34.121 --> 01:45:36.655
The purpose of this meeting
is for you to meet Molly Bloom

01:45:36.657 --> 01:45:38.824
and discover, as I have,
that she's not the person

01:45:38.826 --> 01:45:40.057
the press has invented.

01:45:40.059 --> 01:45:41.494
She's not under
Federal indictment

01:45:41.495 --> 01:45:43.061
for getting bad press, Charlie

01:45:43.063 --> 01:45:45.129
<i>and the purpose of the meeting,
for me is to discover</i>

01:45:45.131 --> 01:45:47.465
<i>if your client is willing to
cooperate with the government</i>

01:45:47.467 --> 01:45:49.901
<i>in putting away
some bad people.</i>

01:45:49.903 --> 01:45:50.835
No.

01:45:50.837 --> 01:45:52.103
You're not willing to cooperate?

01:45:52.105 --> 01:45:56.008
Uh, no, I never traded
sex for money.

01:45:56.010 --> 01:45:58.877
I'm still not sure if there's
a record but if there is

01:45:58.879 --> 01:46:02.079
I want it to be certain
that was in it.

01:46:02.081 --> 01:46:04.148
It appears to me throughout
your career as a game runner

01:46:04.150 --> 01:46:06.185
you were extremely diligent
about vetting players.

01:46:06.187 --> 01:46:07.487
I was.

01:46:07.489 --> 01:46:08.719
But you let four guys
play in the game

01:46:08.721 --> 01:46:10.021
without knowing
they were connected?

01:46:10.023 --> 01:46:12.861
Yeah, plus an FBI informant,
it's embarrassing.

01:46:19.833 --> 01:46:23.302
I was high
at the end and...

01:46:23.304 --> 01:46:25.469
doing my job badly.

01:46:25.472 --> 01:46:29.208
I'll also add that in my limited
experience with the Russian mob

01:46:29.210 --> 01:46:33.512
they don't immediately
present themselves as mobsters.

01:46:33.514 --> 01:46:35.914
My experience with the Italian
mob on the other hand...

01:46:35.916 --> 01:46:37.018
<i>Help us.</i>

01:46:38.685 --> 01:46:40.118
I don't know anything
that can help you.

01:46:40.120 --> 01:46:42.020
- Yes. Yes, you do.
- <i>And if I did...</i>

01:46:42.022 --> 01:46:44.056
<i>You can provide color.
You can paint a picture.</i>

01:46:44.058 --> 01:46:46.023
You can tell us Druzhinsky
wore a $100,000

01:46:46.025 --> 01:46:47.692
Patek Philippe
and even drove a Phantom.

01:46:47.694 --> 01:46:49.361
<i>You can tell us Illya Gershen
showed up</i>

01:46:49.363 --> 01:46:51.429
with a quarter million dollars
cash in a backpack and you can

01:46:51.431 --> 01:46:53.531
tell us how much action Shelly
was taking on a sports bet.

01:46:53.533 --> 01:46:57.268
No one was allowed to place
sports bets inside the room.

01:46:57.270 --> 01:46:58.402
They would have to go outside.

01:46:58.404 --> 01:47:00.271
So I had no idea how much

01:47:00.273 --> 01:47:01.940
anyone was taking or laying.

01:47:01.942 --> 01:47:03.709
So now you're saying
you knew they were making

01:47:03.711 --> 01:47:04.877
and taking sports bets.

01:47:04.879 --> 01:47:06.578
That's the point of them
going outside.

01:47:06.580 --> 01:47:08.547
They could have been calling
their mother for all I knew.

01:47:08.549 --> 01:47:11.148
- <i>Molly?</i>
- Yes, sir.

01:47:11.150 --> 01:47:13.552
I don't believe you.

01:47:13.554 --> 01:47:15.821
In Mike Davidoff's phone
intercepts alone

01:47:15.823 --> 01:47:18.856
just Davidoff, your
name comes up 19 times.

01:47:18.858 --> 01:47:20.926
We need Molly... Get
Molly... Bring Molly...

01:47:20.928 --> 01:47:22.794
<i>It strongly suggests
that you were important</i>

01:47:22.796 --> 01:47:24.329
to his business, so it's hard
for me to believe

01:47:24.331 --> 01:47:26.898
that someone with your savvy
and obvious intellect...

01:47:26.900 --> 01:47:29.935
Talking about the drug...

01:47:29.937 --> 01:47:32.670
Get Molly... Bring Molly...
We need Molly...

01:47:32.672 --> 01:47:35.976
It's... They're talking
about the drug ecstasy.

01:47:38.045 --> 01:47:41.379
Shit. My office is next to yours
for two years

01:47:41.381 --> 01:47:43.815
and I've seen you make
some bone-headed moves

01:47:43.817 --> 01:47:45.816
but I've never seen
any prosecutor

01:47:45.818 --> 01:47:48.620
step in it
the way you just did.

01:47:48.622 --> 01:47:50.088
You should thank
all of the Gods that

01:47:50.090 --> 01:47:51.423
there is no physical evidence
of that exchange.

01:47:51.425 --> 01:47:53.191
- <i>Hey, look.</i>
- No, you look.

01:47:53.193 --> 01:47:54.959
Weren't you going to implore me
to do the right thing?

01:47:54.961 --> 01:47:58.297
This woman does not belong
in a RICO indictment.

01:47:58.299 --> 01:48:00.197
Are you out of your minds?

01:48:00.199 --> 01:48:03.334
<i>She does not belong
in a mob indictment.</i>

01:48:03.336 --> 01:48:06.871
She raked a game, that's it,
for seven months, two years ago.

01:48:06.873 --> 01:48:09.441
And why? Because she was giving
credit in the millions

01:48:09.443 --> 01:48:12.209
and she didn't want to use
muscle to collect.

01:48:12.211 --> 01:48:16.213
She has had opportunity after
opportunity to greatly benefit

01:48:16.215 --> 01:48:19.618
herself by just telling
the real stories that she knows.

01:48:19.620 --> 01:48:23.321
Okay? I have the forensic
imaging going back to 2007.

01:48:23.323 --> 01:48:25.891
And I'm talking
about text messages, emails

01:48:25.893 --> 01:48:28.727
movie stars, rock stars,
athletes, billionaires

01:48:28.729 --> 01:48:31.062
all explicit,
some married with kids

01:48:31.064 --> 01:48:32.964
and that's just
the tip of the iceberg.

01:48:32.966 --> 01:48:34.799
<i>What about the guy
that comes this close</i>

01:48:34.801 --> 01:48:36.701
<i>to being the U.S. Ambassador
to Monaco?</i>

01:48:36.703 --> 01:48:39.338
He's withdrawn from
consideration at the last minute

01:48:39.340 --> 01:48:42.173
no one knows why, she does.

01:48:42.175 --> 01:48:44.676
CEOs with college-aged
mistresses

01:48:44.678 --> 01:48:46.645
an SVP of an investment bank

01:48:46.647 --> 01:48:49.047
who wanted Molly to put
a marked deck in a game.

01:48:49.049 --> 01:48:50.781
<i>The head of a movie studio
that texted her that</i>

01:48:50.783 --> 01:48:53.618
<i>a particular movie star was too
black for his liking, I mean...</i>

01:48:53.620 --> 01:48:58.056
J. Edgar Hoover didn't
have this much shit on Bobby!

01:48:58.058 --> 01:48:59.790
You know, she could
have written a best seller

01:48:59.792 --> 01:49:01.392
and been set for life.

01:49:01.394 --> 01:49:04.428
Easy, she's got the, she's got
the winning lottery ticket

01:49:04.430 --> 01:49:06.266
and she won't cash it.

01:49:08.301 --> 01:49:11.969
Your office took every dollar
she has in a constitutionally

01:49:11.971 --> 01:49:14.039
fucked up seizure
and then put the IRS on her

01:49:14.041 --> 01:49:16.874
to tax what you seized,
I mean...

01:49:16.876 --> 01:49:18.343
I've been in those
strategy meetings.

01:49:18.345 --> 01:49:20.544
You-you broke her back
so she couldn't possibly

01:49:20.546 --> 01:49:22.179
afford to defend herself.

01:49:22.181 --> 01:49:25.017
And now she has an opportunity
to guarantee her freedom

01:49:25.019 --> 01:49:28.085
by "providing color,"
and she still won't do it.

01:49:28.087 --> 01:49:30.355
<i>This woman does not belong
in a RICO indictment</i>

01:49:30.357 --> 01:49:32.324
she belongs
on a box of Wheaties!

01:49:32.326 --> 01:49:35.427
So, yes, Harrison,
I am imploring you

01:49:35.429 --> 01:49:37.062
to do the right thing.

01:49:37.064 --> 01:49:38.763
<i>She knows nothing
about the three Petes</i>

01:49:38.765 --> 01:49:42.933
<i>nothing about Ragnyada, nothing
about RGO or insurance fraud.</i>

01:49:42.935 --> 01:49:45.704
Between the two of us, we've
appeared in front of this judge

01:49:45.706 --> 01:49:48.139
28 times as prosecutors
and not once

01:49:48.141 --> 01:49:50.842
has he deviated from
our sentencing recommendations

01:49:50.844 --> 01:49:53.147
he's not gonna start now.

01:49:55.215 --> 01:49:57.715
<i>I know you've been putting this
bust together for three years</i>

01:49:57.717 --> 01:50:01.085
and there's no one who doesn't
want to see mobsters go to jail

01:50:01.087 --> 01:50:03.954
including and especially
the one person in the room

01:50:03.956 --> 01:50:07.959
who's had one of them
put a gun in her mouth.

01:50:07.961 --> 01:50:09.995
<i>Probation, community service,
or better yet</i>

01:50:09.997 --> 01:50:11.463
<i>just consider that all she did</i>

01:50:11.465 --> 01:50:13.565
<i>was run a poker game
exactly the same way</i>

01:50:13.567 --> 01:50:18.238
every casino in America does
and drop the God damn charges!

01:50:31.350 --> 01:50:33.688
Anything else
you'd like to add?

01:50:35.622 --> 01:50:37.088
<i>No.</i>

01:50:37.090 --> 01:50:39.393
There's nothing else
she'd like to add.

01:50:41.194 --> 01:50:43.462
Uh, I'd like to talk
to Charlie in private

01:50:43.464 --> 01:50:45.198
if that'd be okay with you?

01:50:46.966 --> 01:50:48.299
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:50:48.301 --> 01:50:50.168
Why don't you just grab
some dinner for an hour

01:50:50.170 --> 01:50:52.306
and meet me back at the office?

01:51:08.622 --> 01:51:10.655
Huh? I'm sorry?

01:51:10.657 --> 01:51:12.293
Did you want a hot dog?

01:51:19.565 --> 01:51:21.501
I'll have a pretzel, please.

01:51:55.434 --> 01:51:57.701
Here you go.

01:51:57.703 --> 01:52:02.206
Hi. I would like to rent
a pair of skates, size 7.

01:52:02.208 --> 01:52:04.808
But I don't have any money.

01:52:04.810 --> 01:52:09.446
These are $800 dollar leather
Chanel gloves, I'll trade you.

01:52:09.448 --> 01:52:10.714
$800 dollar gloves?

01:52:10.716 --> 01:52:13.920
And they keep hands just
as warm as the $10 dollar kind.

01:52:15.656 --> 01:52:18.757
- Miss, are you alright?
- I'm fine.

01:52:18.759 --> 01:52:20.825
I'm divesting.

01:52:20.827 --> 01:52:24.012

- Hey, look out.
- Careful.

01:52:57.898 --> 01:52:59.534
Hey, slow down.

01:53:00.500 --> 01:53:02.734
Hey, miss, slow down.

01:53:02.736 --> 01:53:04.002
Catch me.

01:53:04.004 --> 01:53:05.840
Come on, catch me.

01:53:12.446 --> 01:53:14.381
Hey, slow down!

01:53:20.854 --> 01:53:23.090
- <i>Bend your knee.</i>
- Dad?

01:53:23.889 --> 01:53:25.892
- Ah! Ah.
- Oh.

01:53:26.993 --> 01:53:29.261
<i>You alright?</i>

01:53:29.263 --> 01:53:31.933
<i>- Sorry about that.
- I got you.</i>

01:53:32.498 --> 01:53:33.498
Sorry.

01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:35.502
Takin' you off the ice
right now.

01:53:39.706 --> 01:53:40.875
How's it goin'?

01:53:55.756 --> 01:53:58.123
What're you doing in New York?

01:53:58.125 --> 01:53:59.557
And how'd you know
I was at the skating rink?

01:53:59.559 --> 01:54:03.328
- I'm a doctor of the mind.
- Well, dad...

01:54:03.330 --> 01:54:06.431
I'm here in New York,
because that's where you are.

01:54:06.433 --> 01:54:10.235
I called your mom at the hotel
and she said you were here.

01:54:10.237 --> 01:54:12.437
Listen, it's not a big deal,
but from what I saw out there

01:54:12.439 --> 01:54:14.505
I think you're having
a small breakdown.

01:54:14.507 --> 01:54:16.708
That's weird,
I can't think of why.

01:54:16.710 --> 01:54:18.776
Probably because of the arrest
and not knowing

01:54:18.778 --> 01:54:20.178
what's going to happen next.

01:54:20.180 --> 01:54:23.184
Old man, do you really
not recognize sarcasm?

01:54:24.417 --> 01:54:25.685
Do you?

01:54:27.520 --> 01:54:29.353
Here, drink this.

01:54:29.355 --> 01:54:31.655
I'm an alcoholic, I can't drink,
but thanks for remembering.

01:54:31.657 --> 01:54:33.294
It's hot chocolate.

01:54:34.327 --> 01:54:35.860
Okay.

01:54:35.862 --> 01:54:37.428
And for diagnostic purposes

01:54:37.430 --> 01:54:39.463
do you think that we're on
a cocktail lounge right now?

01:54:39.465 --> 01:54:42.066
Seeing waiters
with trays of champagne?

01:54:42.068 --> 01:54:44.205
Wanna check your pulse.

01:54:49.909 --> 01:54:52.209
- Have you found a pulse?
- Yeah.

01:54:52.211 --> 01:54:54.312
Just admiring my watch.

01:54:54.314 --> 01:54:56.213
I can see you're getting
warmed up, but I really

01:54:56.215 --> 01:54:58.048
don't have the emotional
bandwidth to defend

01:54:58.050 --> 01:55:00.084
my "as usual
irresponsible behavior."

01:55:00.086 --> 01:55:01.652
I know, I got your email.

01:55:01.654 --> 01:55:03.521
I get that I'm not
welcome in your life right now.

01:55:03.523 --> 01:55:05.089
As your father though,
you should know

01:55:05.091 --> 01:55:07.558
I could give a shit
if I'm welcome or not.

01:55:07.560 --> 01:55:11.295
But I'm not here in my capacity
as your father.

01:55:11.297 --> 01:55:14.365
I'm indifferent to whether
your father lives or dies.

01:55:14.367 --> 01:55:16.668
I'm a very expensive therapist
and I'm here to give you

01:55:16.670 --> 01:55:18.570
one free session.

01:55:18.572 --> 01:55:20.704
You think what I need
right now is a therapist?

01:55:20.706 --> 01:55:23.643
Ha-ha-ha. Yeah.

01:55:25.578 --> 01:55:28.248
I have to be back
in my lawyer's office soon.

01:55:29.815 --> 01:55:31.883
Do you like your lawyer?

01:55:31.885 --> 01:55:34.185
I wasn't asking for money
when I called you, dad.

01:55:34.187 --> 01:55:36.020
I just needed my dad.

01:55:36.022 --> 01:55:38.356
God forbid you part
with a nickel.

01:55:38.358 --> 01:55:41.125
Yeah, Tiny Tim, you grew up
on a lake and you've skied

01:55:41.127 --> 01:55:43.128
all over the world,
were those work houses tough?

01:55:43.130 --> 01:55:44.495
- I gotta go.
- Molly.

01:55:44.497 --> 01:55:48.335
- I gotta go.
- Molly, sit the fuck down.

01:55:58.444 --> 01:56:00.145
Alright, we're gonna do
three years of therapy

01:56:00.147 --> 01:56:01.913
in three minutes.

01:56:01.915 --> 01:56:03.213
How?

01:56:03.215 --> 01:56:05.016
I'm gonna do what patients
have been begging

01:56:05.018 --> 01:56:06.217
therapists to do
for a hundred years.

01:56:06.219 --> 01:56:08.686
I'm just gonna give you
the answers.

01:56:08.688 --> 01:56:10.888
- To what?
- Well, let's start with this.

01:56:10.890 --> 01:56:12.956
Why does a young woman,
who, at 22

01:56:12.958 --> 01:56:16.794
has a gold-plated resume,
why does she run poker games?

01:56:16.796 --> 01:56:18.696
Why did I choose
to make a ton of money?

01:56:18.698 --> 01:56:19.897
That's a head scratcher.

01:56:19.899 --> 01:56:22.200
You were gonna be a success
at anything you wanted.

01:56:22.202 --> 01:56:24.669
You know it. If you'd gone
to law school, you'd have...

01:56:24.671 --> 01:56:26.971
You'd have owned
the law firm by now.

01:56:26.973 --> 01:56:29.676
Why did you do
the other thing instead?

01:56:30.309 --> 01:56:32.877
I don't know.

01:56:32.879 --> 01:56:35.146
Drugs.

01:56:35.148 --> 01:56:36.713
You didn't start with the drugs
until the end.

01:56:36.715 --> 01:56:40.250
They weren't the problem,
they were the medicine.

01:56:40.252 --> 01:56:43.256
It was so you could
control powerful men.

01:56:45.925 --> 01:56:50.130
Your addiction was
having power over powerful men.

01:56:54.367 --> 01:56:57.134
- Is that what you really think?
- No.

01:56:57.136 --> 01:56:58.703
I know it for sure.

01:56:58.705 --> 01:57:01.572
You've now completed
your first year of therapy.

01:57:01.574 --> 01:57:03.842
I saw an opportunity,
it wasn't about you.

01:57:03.844 --> 01:57:05.677
Nah, it wasn't just about me.

01:57:05.679 --> 01:57:08.582
- It wasn't at all about you.
- It was.

01:57:09.416 --> 01:57:12.086
Second year, second question.

01:57:14.955 --> 01:57:16.920
Do you think
you were a good husband?

01:57:16.922 --> 01:57:18.423
What do you care?

01:57:18.425 --> 01:57:20.224
I care because you were married
to my mother.

01:57:20.226 --> 01:57:22.192
I care because
my father's an asshole.

01:57:22.194 --> 01:57:23.995
Congratulations.

01:57:23.997 --> 01:57:25.696
You've completed year two.

01:57:25.698 --> 01:57:27.932
And for the record,
your father raised three kids

01:57:27.934 --> 01:57:29.601
on a college professor's salary.

01:57:29.603 --> 01:57:32.236
One of them
is a two-time Olympian

01:57:32.238 --> 01:57:34.505
a sixth round draft pick
of the Philadelphia Eagles

01:57:34.507 --> 01:57:37.040
and a leading philanthropist.

01:57:37.042 --> 01:57:39.776
The other is a cardiothoracic
surgeon at Mass General

01:57:39.778 --> 01:57:43.647
and the third managed to build
a multi million dollar business

01:57:43.649 --> 01:57:46.488
using not much more
than her wits.

01:57:48.321 --> 01:57:50.722
I'm about to plead guilty
in Federal Court.

01:57:50.724 --> 01:57:52.456
Well, nobody's perfect.

01:57:52.458 --> 01:57:55.293
The point is I did
a few things right.

01:57:55.295 --> 01:57:56.694
Last question.

01:57:56.696 --> 01:57:58.129
No. I've to go.

01:57:58.131 --> 01:58:02.169
Last question, Mol. I'll answer
it, but you have to ask it.

01:58:04.970 --> 01:58:07.774
You have... to ask it.

01:58:18.083 --> 01:58:21.119
Why didn't you like me
as much as my brothers?

01:58:21.121 --> 01:58:22.922
There it is.

01:58:25.493 --> 01:58:26.760
I did.

01:58:28.428 --> 01:58:32.163
It only from time to time
appeared that I didn't.

01:58:32.165 --> 01:58:34.231
It only appeared
that you didn't?

01:58:34.233 --> 01:58:35.365
Yeah.

01:58:35.367 --> 01:58:38.369
That is some
Schedule 1 bullshit.

01:58:38.371 --> 01:58:40.637
Why would...
"It only appeared..." What?

01:58:40.639 --> 01:58:43.874
What? O-okay,
I had an attitude problem.

01:58:43.876 --> 01:58:46.511
I talked back, I...

01:58:46.513 --> 01:58:48.545
broke some normal
adolescent rules.

01:58:48.547 --> 01:58:51.281
I snuck phone time after curfew

01:58:51.283 --> 01:58:52.349
I took your car
when I wasn't allowed to.

01:58:52.351 --> 01:58:53.951
You drove it into a McDonalds.

01:58:53.953 --> 01:58:55.285
And kids get punished for that
but they don't...

01:58:55.287 --> 01:58:56.687
Did you not see the McDonalds?

01:58:56.689 --> 01:58:59.022
I mean, did you misunderstand
what drive-thru meant?

01:58:59.024 --> 01:59:01.159
You'd turn into a different
person, your voice, your face...

01:59:01.161 --> 01:59:03.464
It's because
I knew you knew.

01:59:05.398 --> 01:59:07.365
I didn't hear what you said.

01:59:07.367 --> 01:59:09.099
I said...

01:59:09.101 --> 01:59:11.134
"I knew you knew."

01:59:11.136 --> 01:59:12.536
You knew I knew what?

01:59:12.538 --> 01:59:14.004
<i>What do you, uh, think about</i>

01:59:14.006 --> 01:59:15.405
<i>the following concepts?</i>

01:59:15.407 --> 01:59:17.909
<i>Just going to run them
by you. Marriage?</i>

01:59:17.911 --> 01:59:20.244
It is a trap.

01:59:20.246 --> 01:59:23.181
That I was cheating on mom.

01:59:23.183 --> 01:59:24.749
I knew you knew.

01:59:24.751 --> 01:59:27.517
- <i>Society?</i>
- It is a joke.

01:59:27.519 --> 01:59:30.355
No. I didn't know
unt-until I was 20.

01:59:30.357 --> 01:59:32.923
- <i>People?</i>
- I don't trust people.

01:59:32.925 --> 01:59:35.226
<i>No, you'd known
since you were five.</i>

01:59:35.228 --> 01:59:38.899
You saw me in my car and you
really didn't know what you saw.

01:59:41.835 --> 01:59:43.604
I don't have any heroes.

01:59:46.006 --> 01:59:49.843
You knew, honey, and I knew
you knew. And that's...

01:59:51.644 --> 01:59:55.312
That's how I reacted
to the shame.

01:59:55.314 --> 01:59:57.914
And you reacted by showing...

01:59:57.916 --> 02:00:00.386
seething contempt for me.

02:00:01.520 --> 02:00:04.655
By driving my car
into McDonalds.

02:00:04.657 --> 02:00:07.090
Wanting to have power over
powerful men?

02:00:07.092 --> 02:00:08.625
No.

02:00:08.627 --> 02:00:11.495
That was a red-herring
just to make you mad.

02:00:11.497 --> 02:00:13.967
- You're such...
- You tripped over a stick.

02:00:15.568 --> 02:00:19.137
Okay? Twelve years ago,
you tripped over a stick.

02:00:19.139 --> 02:00:23.141
It was a one in a million thing.
You tripped over a stick.

02:00:23.143 --> 02:00:25.442
That's what you did wrong.

02:00:25.444 --> 02:00:27.581
There's your session.

02:00:33.252 --> 02:00:35.319
It's funny how much faster
you can go

02:00:35.321 --> 02:00:37.855
when you're not charging
by the hour.

02:00:37.857 --> 02:00:40.391
I'm your father.

02:00:40.393 --> 02:00:43.593
Trying to comprehend
how much I love you

02:00:43.595 --> 02:00:46.463
would be like trying
to visualize the size

02:00:46.465 --> 02:00:48.401
of the universe.

02:00:49.769 --> 02:00:52.136
I didn't know...

02:00:52.138 --> 02:00:55.476
you'd got beaten up
until I read it in your book.

02:00:56.975 --> 02:00:58.543
It was a hell of a way
to learn about it.

02:00:58.545 --> 02:01:01.245
You should know
that I'm hirin' someone

02:01:01.247 --> 02:01:02.379
to find the guy who did it.

02:01:02.381 --> 02:01:04.347
Then, I'm hirin'
someone to kill him.

02:01:04.349 --> 02:01:05.816
Don't even joke about that.

02:01:05.818 --> 02:01:07.086
I'm not.

02:01:08.988 --> 02:01:11.021
It wasn't a purse snatcher, dad.
It was the mafia...

02:01:11.023 --> 02:01:12.990
I don't care
if it's the leader of Hamas.

02:01:12.992 --> 02:01:16.663
Someone put their hands
on you, they're gonna suffer.

02:01:20.567 --> 02:01:23.404
- Dad, I'm fine.
- No, they're gonna suffer.

02:01:24.938 --> 02:01:26.236
Dad...

02:01:26.238 --> 02:01:27.938
- I'm, I'm alright.
- No.

02:01:27.940 --> 02:01:29.576
They're gonna suffer.

02:01:34.314 --> 02:01:36.116
Really, I'm fine.

02:02:02.074 --> 02:02:04.008
- <i>Did you know that...</i>
- Oh!

02:02:04.010 --> 02:02:05.776
I didn't see you.

02:02:05.778 --> 02:02:07.245
Did you know that we know
what the center

02:02:07.247 --> 02:02:10.447
of our galaxy smells like?

02:02:10.449 --> 02:02:13.217
It smells like
rum and raspberries.

02:02:13.219 --> 02:02:15.152
<i>The center of the galaxy
is ethyl formate</i>

02:02:15.154 --> 02:02:17.387
which is the same gas
that gives rum its smell.

02:02:17.389 --> 02:02:19.589
And raspberries their taste.

02:02:19.591 --> 02:02:21.292
Why do you know these things?

02:02:21.294 --> 02:02:23.794
<i>To stay busy during games,
I surfed the internet.</i>

02:02:23.796 --> 02:02:26.798
Then I started
taking online courses.

02:02:26.800 --> 02:02:28.865
I'm 12 credits away
from a degree in Astronomy

02:02:28.867 --> 02:02:31.004
I didn't even know
I was enrolled.

02:02:34.006 --> 02:02:36.106
<i>Hey.</i>

02:02:36.108 --> 02:02:38.778
I wanna thank you
for what you said tonight.

02:02:42.549 --> 02:02:44.016
It was Stella...

02:02:47.554 --> 02:02:49.719
who asked me to be your lawyer.

02:02:49.721 --> 02:02:51.121
She read the book.

02:02:51.123 --> 02:02:52.990
I accused her
of reading trash.

02:02:52.992 --> 02:02:58.129
But she defended
the book impressively.

02:02:58.131 --> 02:03:01.398
And then defended you.

02:03:01.400 --> 02:03:03.537
You're her role model.

02:03:05.037 --> 02:03:06.973
I'm good with that.

02:03:10.976 --> 02:03:13.113
There's a new offer
on the table.

02:03:14.380 --> 02:03:15.545
What is it?

02:03:15.547 --> 02:03:17.484
We hand over the hard drives.

02:03:18.650 --> 02:03:19.851
I don't get it.

02:03:19.853 --> 02:03:21.486
We hand over
the forensic imaging

02:03:21.488 --> 02:03:23.321
of the emails and texts
in exchange for...

02:03:23.323 --> 02:03:26.527
Exchange for, what could they
possibly offer me to do that?

02:03:35.033 --> 02:03:37.471
I wrote it all down.
It's, um...

02:03:45.345 --> 02:03:47.812
Your money back.

02:03:47.814 --> 02:03:50.818
They'll give you all your money
back, plus interest.

02:03:51.783 --> 02:03:54.584
It's over five million dollars.

02:03:54.586 --> 02:03:57.056
Is that why they took it
in the first place?

02:03:58.157 --> 02:03:59.656
So they could offer it
back to me?

02:03:59.658 --> 02:04:01.124
Yeah. For what it's worth

02:04:01.126 --> 02:04:03.160
if we went to trial,
you'd have to hand over

02:04:03.162 --> 02:04:05.062
the forensic imaging
and the discoveries.

02:04:05.064 --> 02:04:06.963
But that's different than
voluntarily handing it over...

02:04:06.965 --> 02:04:09.532
Sure, but it's not really
voluntary anymore

02:04:09.534 --> 02:04:11.401
when the alternative
is prison.

02:04:11.403 --> 02:04:13.906
And that's what they're going
to recommend, 42 months.

02:04:17.876 --> 02:04:19.610
<i>Why do you keep breaking
eye contact with me?</i>

02:04:19.612 --> 02:04:21.812
I-I'm looking right at you.

02:04:21.814 --> 02:04:23.580
You think I should do it.

02:04:23.582 --> 02:04:25.148
You gotta let me keep
you out of prison.

02:04:25.150 --> 02:04:26.450
You've seen
what's on those hard drives.

02:04:26.452 --> 02:04:27.718
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

02:04:27.720 --> 02:04:28.785
It's a lot more
than a little color.

02:04:28.787 --> 02:04:30.553
<i>Yeah, but complete immunity.</i>

02:04:30.555 --> 02:04:32.123
Alright?
You get all your money back.

02:04:32.125 --> 02:04:34.191
You'd be the first defendant
to walk out of a courtroom

02:04:34.193 --> 02:04:35.660
<i>better off
than when you walked in.</i>

02:04:35.662 --> 02:04:37.695
Careers will be ruined.

02:04:37.697 --> 02:04:40.164
Families, wives, lives on both...

02:04:40.166 --> 02:04:42.732
<i>Hey, you know,
w-when a rich goes to jail</i>

02:04:42.734 --> 02:04:44.669
he spreads his money around,
his-his lawyer knows

02:04:44.671 --> 02:04:46.137
how to take care of that.

02:04:46.139 --> 02:04:49.039
He spreads his money around.
You don't have any.

02:04:49.041 --> 02:04:51.942
<i>The composition of female
inmates in a federal prison.</i>

02:04:51.944 --> 02:04:54.245
<i>They did not commit
financial crimes.</i>

02:04:54.247 --> 02:04:56.780
They're drug dealers.
They get raped by prison guards.

02:04:56.782 --> 02:04:58.249
Y-you will... You...

02:04:58.251 --> 02:04:59.849
You will not be anonymous,
Molly.

02:04:59.851 --> 02:05:01.352
<i>You will be a target!</i>

02:05:01.354 --> 02:05:03.754
Children will read
their father's text messages

02:05:03.756 --> 02:05:06.856
saying he wished
he'd never had kids.

02:05:06.858 --> 02:05:08.926
- These guys...
- <i>These guys, where are they?</i>

02:05:08.928 --> 02:05:11.128
Why're you in this alone?
Where are your friends?

02:05:11.130 --> 02:05:13.897
Where is the one guy saying,
"Hey, you know, Molly

02:05:13.899 --> 02:05:15.732
"I know you're doing everything
to save my life.

02:05:15.734 --> 02:05:17.868
What can I do for you?
Let me buy you a sandwich."

02:05:17.870 --> 02:05:20.472
Where are they, Molly?
You kept their secrets.

02:05:20.474 --> 02:05:22.440
Where are the people
you're protecting by not telling

02:05:22.442 --> 02:05:23.773
the whole story in the book?

02:05:23.775 --> 02:05:25.508
By settling
the Brad Marion suit.

02:05:25.510 --> 02:05:27.544
By not taking
five million dollars

02:05:27.546 --> 02:05:29.379
of your own money,
by going to jail!

02:05:29.381 --> 02:05:30.714
Where did everybody go?

02:05:30.716 --> 02:05:33.116
It's not their names
I'm protecting, Charlie.

02:05:33.118 --> 02:05:34.584
- It's mine.
- Oh, that's great.

02:05:34.586 --> 02:05:37.154
Well, we don't have
the luxury of integrity.

02:05:37.156 --> 02:05:39.322
- You have to take the deal.
- No.

02:05:39.324 --> 02:05:41.157
You stay out of jail,
you get your money back.

02:05:41.159 --> 02:05:42.093
You pay your debts.

02:05:42.095 --> 02:05:43.326
- You start a new life!
- No.

02:05:43.328 --> 02:05:45.062
Is this self-imposed punishment

02:05:45.064 --> 02:05:46.998
for namin' four guys
in a book?

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:48.598
- It's not.
- You didn't do anything wrong.

02:05:48.600 --> 02:05:52.169
I threw four people under
the bus for $35,000, Charlie.

02:05:52.171 --> 02:05:53.737
I noticed you kept that out of
your speech to the prosecutor...

02:05:53.739 --> 02:05:55.138
No, don't do that to me.

02:05:55.140 --> 02:05:56.673
<i>I took advantage
of gambling addicts.</i>

02:05:56.675 --> 02:05:58.909
Donnie Silverman,
my brilliant find.

02:05:58.911 --> 02:06:00.844
He lost six million dollars
on my table...

02:06:00.846 --> 02:06:03.380
- Molly, stop. Stop. Uh-huh.
- <i>Moved to Florida.</i>

02:06:03.382 --> 02:06:05.348
Got a job as a substitute
teacher, then hanged himself.

02:06:05.350 --> 02:06:07.118
- In his shower.
- Oh! And that's your fault.

02:06:07.120 --> 02:06:08.986
- That's not your fault!
- <i>Donnie Silverman's dead!</i>

02:06:08.988 --> 02:06:12.088
Harlan Eustice is in jail
in Nevada wishing he was.

02:06:12.090 --> 02:06:13.523
But that's not why
I'm saying no.

02:06:13.525 --> 02:06:14.924
You're not saying no.

02:06:14.926 --> 02:06:16.360
I was named
after my great grandmother.

02:06:16.362 --> 02:06:18.262
- I don't care, you stay here...
- Molly Dubin Bloom...

02:06:18.264 --> 02:06:19.996
- <i>...all night, you understand?</i>
- ...is my name.

02:06:19.998 --> 02:06:22.532
Until you understand nobody
gives a shit

02:06:22.534 --> 02:06:23.633
about your good name.

02:06:23.635 --> 02:06:25.436
- I do!
- <i>Why?</i>

02:06:25.438 --> 02:06:26.637
- Because...
- <i>Why?</i>

02:06:26.639 --> 02:06:28.138
- Because...
- Tell me why!

02:06:28.140 --> 02:06:31.709
Because it's all I have left.

02:06:31.711 --> 02:06:34.181
Because it's my name.

02:06:37.582 --> 02:06:41.220
And I'll never have another.

02:06:45.657 --> 02:06:48.359
Now, you read "The Crucible!"

02:06:48.361 --> 02:06:51.562
Yeah. Everyone's right.
It's great.

02:06:51.564 --> 02:06:53.000
It is great.

02:07:00.206 --> 02:07:02.342
I want to go
into that courtroom...

02:07:04.242 --> 02:07:05.711
and plead guilty.

02:07:06.480 --> 02:07:09.116
No deals. No trades.

02:07:14.319 --> 02:07:17.088
And you're very sure?

02:07:17.090 --> 02:07:18.091
Yes.

02:07:20.693 --> 02:07:22.392
<i>All rise.</i>

02:07:22.394 --> 02:07:25.161
<i>The business
of the court began.</i>

02:07:25.163 --> 02:07:28.566
<i>We stood for the honorable
judge Dustin Foxman.</i>

02:07:28.568 --> 02:07:30.433
<i>And counsel entered
their names for the record.</i>

02:07:30.435 --> 02:07:32.136
Assistant U.S. Attorney
Harrison Wellstone

02:07:32.138 --> 02:07:33.736
for the Southern District
of New York...

02:07:33.738 --> 02:07:35.873
- <i>The docket was called.</i>
- Docket number 1009...

02:07:35.875 --> 02:07:38.976
<i>And some pro forma
instructions were given to counsel.</i>

02:07:38.978 --> 02:07:40.611
<i>And I was asked a series
of questions</i>

02:07:40.613 --> 02:07:42.312
<i>from a script
the judge had in front of him.</i>

02:07:42.314 --> 02:07:43.746
Molly Dubin Bloom.

02:07:43.748 --> 02:07:44.848
How old are you?

02:07:44.850 --> 02:07:46.249
<i>Have you taken any drugs?</i>

02:07:46.251 --> 02:07:47.951
<i>Medicine or pills, or had any</i>

02:07:47.953 --> 02:07:50.254
<i>alcoholic beverages
in the past 48 hours?</i>

02:07:50.256 --> 02:07:51.187
Sudafed.

02:07:51.189 --> 02:07:52.491
Is there anything about
the reasons

02:07:52.493 --> 02:07:53.757
for you taking Sudafed

02:07:53.759 --> 02:07:55.258
that would interfere
with what's going on...

02:07:55.260 --> 02:07:57.328
<i>87 questions
he was required to ask</i>

02:07:57.330 --> 02:07:59.262
<i>before he'd permit me
to plead guilty.</i>

02:07:59.264 --> 02:08:00.763
<i>Is your mind
clear today, Ms. Bloom?</i>

02:08:00.765 --> 02:08:02.133
- It is.
- Do you understand...

02:08:02.135 --> 02:08:03.467
- What's going on here today?
- I do.

02:08:03.469 --> 02:08:05.102
<i>Under the constitution and laws</i>

02:08:05.104 --> 02:08:06.837
of the United States,
you have a right

02:08:06.839 --> 02:08:08.806
to plead to the charges
in the indictment.

02:08:08.808 --> 02:08:10.773
- Do you understand that?
- Yes, Your Honor.

02:08:10.775 --> 02:08:12.610
- And do you understand that?
- Yes, sir.

02:08:12.612 --> 02:08:15.312
At that trial,
you would be presumed to be

02:08:15.314 --> 02:08:18.081
innocent and would not have
to prove that you were innocent.

02:08:18.083 --> 02:08:19.917
- Do you understand that?
- Yes, sir.

02:08:19.919 --> 02:08:20.950
Yes, Your Honor.

02:08:20.952 --> 02:08:21.986
Yes, sir.

02:08:21.988 --> 02:08:23.454
If you plead guilty

02:08:23.456 --> 02:08:24.922
and I accept your plea

02:08:24.924 --> 02:08:26.523
<i>you will give up
your right to appeal</i>

02:08:26.525 --> 02:08:29.325
along with all other rights
I've enumerated.

02:08:29.327 --> 02:08:31.896
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

02:08:31.898 --> 02:08:33.563
Do you understand
that you are charged

02:08:33.565 --> 02:08:36.901
in count 20 with operating
an illegal gambling business

02:08:36.903 --> 02:08:39.703
in violation of Title 18
United States

02:08:39.705 --> 02:08:42.806
Code Sections 1-9-5-5 and 2?

02:08:42.808 --> 02:08:44.141
Yes, I understand.

02:08:44.143 --> 02:08:46.610
Understanding everything
you've been told

02:08:46.612 --> 02:08:48.512
do you now wish
to enter a plea?

02:08:48.514 --> 02:08:52.383
- Yes, sir.
- How do you plead to the charge?

02:08:52.385 --> 02:08:53.820
Guilty, Your Honor.

02:08:54.854 --> 02:08:57.954
Your plea has been so recorded.

02:08:57.956 --> 02:08:59.589
<i>And you may take your seat.</i>

02:08:59.591 --> 02:09:01.959
<i>Before we move
to the sentencing phase</i>

02:09:01.961 --> 02:09:04.064
I would like a word
with counsel, please.

02:09:07.166 --> 02:09:08.932
<i>And then, something happened.</i>

02:09:08.934 --> 02:09:11.937
Pardon me, Mr. Jaffey,
just government counsel.

02:09:14.540 --> 02:09:16.009
Yes, sir.

02:09:20.480 --> 02:09:21.915
What's going on?

02:09:23.648 --> 02:09:25.584
What are they doing?

02:09:31.023 --> 02:09:34.461
- Wait for it.
- What?

02:09:38.531 --> 02:09:41.167
Will the defendant please rise
for sentencing?

02:09:46.005 --> 02:09:47.972
Based on all available
information

02:09:47.974 --> 02:09:49.740
this court manifestly disagrees

02:09:49.742 --> 02:09:52.412
<i>with the government's
sentencing recommendation.</i>

02:09:54.346 --> 02:09:56.179
This courthouse
is located within

02:09:56.181 --> 02:09:58.182
spitting distance
of Wall Street.

02:09:58.184 --> 02:10:00.150
I know this
from my personal experience

02:10:00.152 --> 02:10:01.685
trying to spit at it.

02:10:01.687 --> 02:10:03.286
The men and women
who work there will commit

02:10:03.288 --> 02:10:05.388
more serious crimes
by lunchtime today

02:10:05.390 --> 02:10:08.392
than the defendant has committed
in this indictment.

02:10:08.394 --> 02:10:11.395
I simply don't see how
either the people or the cause

02:10:11.397 --> 02:10:13.963
of justice are served
by locking Molly Boom in prison.

02:10:13.965 --> 02:10:17.000
<i>It was as casual as if he
was ordering lunch off a menu.</i>

02:10:17.002 --> 02:10:19.503
Ms. Bloom,
this court sentences you

02:10:19.505 --> 02:10:21.704
to 200 hours
of community service.

02:10:21.706 --> 02:10:24.374
<i>One year
of supervised probation.</i>

02:10:24.376 --> 02:10:28.779
<i>Drug testing
and a $200,000 fine.</i>

02:10:28.781 --> 02:10:31.014
This case is adjourned.

02:10:31.016 --> 02:10:33.153
<i>And that was that.</i>

02:10:34.488 --> 02:10:36.152
<i>There was crying and hugging.</i>

02:10:36.154 --> 02:10:37.954
<i>Jokes from my brothers.</i>

02:10:37.956 --> 02:10:41.557
<i>Tough talk about how no one
messes with the Blooms.</i>

02:10:41.559 --> 02:10:45.529
<i>And level-headed talk
about Christmas miracles.</i>

02:10:45.531 --> 02:10:48.565
<i>Steaks and beer
bought by my father</i>

02:10:48.567 --> 02:10:50.066
<i>and full reenactments.</i>

02:10:50.068 --> 02:10:52.169
<i>And in the middle of it all</i>

02:10:52.171 --> 02:10:54.504
<i>as grateful as you are</i>

02:10:54.506 --> 02:10:57.509
<i>the reality starts creeping
toward you like the tide.</i>

02:10:59.711 --> 02:11:03.213
<i>And that's the first time
you have the thought.</i>

02:11:03.215 --> 02:11:05.949
<i>What do I do know?</i>

02:11:05.951 --> 02:11:07.551
<i>We've got a racer down!</i>

02:11:07.553 --> 02:11:09.386
<i>We need a toboggan
and a back board!</i>

02:11:09.388 --> 02:11:12.289
<i>I'm a felon,
I'm 35 years old</i>

02:11:12.291 --> 02:11:15.459
<i>unemployed, and pled guilty
in a mob indictment.</i>

02:11:15.461 --> 02:11:17.361
Make way, people!
Make way!

02:11:17.363 --> 02:11:19.196
Patrol here, move away!
Move away!

02:11:19.198 --> 02:11:21.397
<i>I owe the government
close to $2,000,000</i>

02:11:21.399 --> 02:11:24.200
<i>in taxes assessed
on the civil forfeiture.</i>

02:11:24.202 --> 02:11:26.503
<i>Plus, a $200,000 fine.</i>

02:11:26.505 --> 02:11:28.237
<i>And you better believe
they're gonna come get it.</i>

02:11:28.239 --> 02:11:30.874
Clear a path!
Move back please!

02:11:30.876 --> 02:11:33.377
<i>I have a quarter of a million
dollars in legal bills.</i>

02:11:33.379 --> 02:11:35.713
<i>I don't know what I'd say
in a job interview.</i>

02:11:35.715 --> 02:11:39.083
<i>Or if I'll ever be given
a job interview.</i>

02:11:39.085 --> 02:11:40.851
<i>I'll never be allowed
to vote again.</i>

02:11:40.853 --> 02:11:42.785
<i>I'm going to
need a set of vitals.</i>

02:11:42.787 --> 02:11:45.021
<i>And for some
reason, I'm not allowed</i>

02:11:45.023 --> 02:11:47.458
<i>to go to Canada.</i>

02:11:47.460 --> 02:11:49.593
<i>Molly, can you hear us?</i>

02:11:49.595 --> 02:11:53.329
<i>Hips are stable.
Pelvis is stable.</i>

02:11:53.331 --> 02:11:54.798
Yeah.

02:11:54.800 --> 02:11:56.400
- Her dad's here.
- What's her LOA?

02:11:56.402 --> 02:11:58.134
<i>- Uh, she's comin' around now.
- Open your eyes...</i>

02:11:58.136 --> 02:11:59.770
<i>- If you can hear us.
- Okay, she's conscious.</i>

02:11:59.772 --> 02:12:01.571
- Molly, what day is it?
- <i>You need to stay down, okay?</i>

02:12:01.573 --> 02:12:03.507
<i>You need to go to a hospital.</i>

02:12:03.509 --> 02:12:05.342
What day?

02:12:05.344 --> 02:12:07.343
- Dad, I'm fine.
- <i>Trust you not to move, Molly.</i>

02:12:07.345 --> 02:12:08.745
- Let go of my arm.
- <i>You trying to get up, hon?</i>

02:12:08.747 --> 02:12:10.614
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- She wants to get up.

02:12:10.616 --> 02:12:11.949
<i>Our cameras
can't get in there</i>

02:12:11.951 --> 02:12:13.485
<i>so we don't know...</i>

02:12:13.487 --> 02:12:14.752
<i>I wonder if
Tracy's got an update</i>

02:12:14.754 --> 02:12:16.018
<i>for us on the ground.</i>

02:12:16.020 --> 02:12:18.388
<i>- She's moving.
- She's moving.</i>

02:12:18.390 --> 02:12:20.156
- You sure you're good?
- Yeah.

02:12:20.158 --> 02:12:22.959
Okay, here we go.

02:12:22.961 --> 02:12:26.496
<i>We can see that she's
being helped to her feet now.</i>

02:12:26.498 --> 02:12:29.232
Molly Bloom is of course,
the sister of Jeremy Bloom

02:12:29.234 --> 02:12:31.834
who holds the world's
number one ranking.

02:12:31.836 --> 02:12:34.670
<i>That's her long time coach
there, Ted Keene</i>

02:12:34.672 --> 02:12:36.440
<i>and her father.</i>

02:12:36.442 --> 02:12:40.043
<i>She came back from an injury
when she was just 13.</i>

02:12:40.045 --> 02:12:42.780
<i>You know, you have to wonder
about the psychological toll</i>

02:12:42.782 --> 02:12:47.151
<i>coming that close,
only to lose it like that.</i>

02:12:47.153 --> 02:12:49.919
<i>Did anything good come of this?</i>

02:12:49.921 --> 02:12:51.123
<i>Not really.</i>

02:12:54.794 --> 02:12:56.959
<i>But I learned
something encouraging.</i>

02:12:56.961 --> 02:12:59.029
<i>I'm very hard to kill.</i>

02:12:59.031 --> 02:13:01.130
<i>You and I both know
people who've never gotten over it.</i>

02:13:01.132 --> 02:13:03.333
<i>I don't know if the
young woman we've just seen is</i>

02:13:03.335 --> 02:13:05.201
<i>is one of those people,
we may not see her ski</i>

02:13:05.203 --> 02:13:07.472
<i>competitively again, but I
think we're gonna see her.</i>

02:13:07.474 --> 02:13:09.539
<i>Winston Churchill
defined success</i>

02:13:09.541 --> 02:13:12.375

<i>with no loss of enthusiasm."</i>

02:13:14.447 --> 02:13:17.181
<i>So, I guess I'm pot-committed.</i>

02:13:17.183 --> 02:13:18.248
<i>She'll be back.</i>

02:13:18.250 --> 02:13:19.282
