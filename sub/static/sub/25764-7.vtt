Previously on Chesapeake Shores:

00:02.752 --> 00:06.172
The measure of a man's success is
who he has to truly share it with.

00:06.339 --> 00:08.090
Hi, Trace. Wish you were here.

00:08.550 --> 00:13.012
My family excels at seeming fine,
but never even close to being okay.

00:13.179 --> 00:16.641
I've applied to every department
within 100 miles of here.

00:16.808 --> 00:18.226
So far, nothing close by.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.508
I consolidated my eight
scripts into seven.

00:20.509 --> 00:23.773
Now I only have to eliminate six more.

00:23.940 --> 00:25.734
Actually, Terri is Ms. Marvel.

00:25.900 --> 00:27.193
- What?
- I love her.

00:27.360 --> 00:31.322
I hope you like her too because
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

00:35.618 --> 00:36.828
Read it again.

00:36.995 --> 00:38.446
"Behind the rock, there is a sock,

00:38.447 --> 00:41.458
and inside a clock, to beat the lock."

00:41.624 --> 00:43.543
Come on, let's go.

00:43.710 --> 00:46.421
- How long can you keep doing this?
- Doing what?

00:46.588 --> 00:49.507
Making ice cream, going
to pottery classes...

00:49.674 --> 00:53.178
planning scavenger hunts
before you go to work at night.

00:53.344 --> 00:55.889
I'm trying to spend quality
time with my daughters.

00:56.056 --> 00:58.683
Abby, it's not a competition.

00:58.850 --> 01:01.853
Ms. Marvel is just Wes's
girlfriend. She's not you.

01:03.229 --> 01:06.316
Do you know that last week,
she made Carrie and Caitlyn...

01:06.483 --> 01:10.278
an Italian dinner, complete
with red-checkered tablecloths...

01:10.445 --> 01:14.824
and an Italian menu. She even
taught them a few words in Italian.

01:14.991 --> 01:19.287
I'm just trying to be
the best mom I can be.

01:21.331 --> 01:23.374
What if you can't?

01:25.585 --> 01:27.545
What are you saying?

01:27.712 --> 01:30.256
I'm saying, what if
you can't be perfect?

01:30.423 --> 01:33.510
Because no one is. You're
gonna burn yourself out.

01:33.676 --> 01:37.597
Oh, really? Said the pot to the
kettle. Your next show is where?

01:37.764 --> 01:41.100
- North Carolina.
- How much longer you gonna do that?

01:41.267 --> 01:44.646
Spend days with us and
go to shows at night.

01:44.813 --> 01:47.649
We found the sock!

01:47.816 --> 01:50.151
Eleven-fifteen and 20 seconds.

01:50.318 --> 01:52.403
Okay. So, what does it say?

01:53.571 --> 01:55.502
"Get to the bottom of the problem.

01:55.503 --> 01:57.867
A slippery slope will bring you hope."

01:58.034 --> 02:00.245
It's the slide.

02:00.870 --> 02:04.165
- Come on, let's go get it.
- Abby, you and me?

02:04.332 --> 02:06.626
We'll make it work. We always do.

02:08.002 --> 02:10.420
- I hope so.
- Ugh.

02:11.923 --> 02:13.758
Hello?

02:15.969 --> 02:18.555
What do you mean, the check bounced?

02:18.721 --> 02:20.682
How is that possible?

02:25.061 --> 02:29.232
- Thanks again for meeting me here.
- Yeah. Anything for the Rileys.

02:29.399 --> 02:32.235
My firm called your accountants
to start running numbers...

02:32.402 --> 02:34.487
How bad did we get hit?

02:36.000 --> 02:42.074

03:57.111 --> 04:00.031
- Connor?
- Oh, hey, Gran.

04:00.823 --> 04:04.535
- What are you doing?
- Just another day saving the world.

04:04.702 --> 04:08.915
No, I mean, what are you
doing here, eating breakfast?

04:09.082 --> 04:11.063
Oh, I got no time to shop for groceries.

04:11.064 --> 04:14.128
I have no time to do anything but work.

04:14.295 --> 04:15.880
Welcome to the real world.

04:16.297 --> 04:19.591
And you, pretty lady, what
time did you get in last night?

04:19.759 --> 04:23.304
- You mean this morning?
- Yeah. Morning for me too.

04:23.471 --> 04:28.101
Although, now I'm an expert on
every flora, fauna, fungi, fish...

04:28.268 --> 04:30.228
and fowl in Chesapeake.

04:30.395 --> 04:32.313
- Case going to trial?
- Not yet.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.440
The developer brought
in outside counsel.

04:34.607 --> 04:38.403
- Today, we meet their new hired guns.
- What's your excuse?

04:38.569 --> 04:40.380
Oh, I just need more time in the day

04:40.381 --> 04:42.991
and in the night, or
somewhere in between.

04:43.741 --> 04:47.537
- I thought you had to go to Miami.
- Something came up.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.565
And, Kevin, are you gonna tell me

04:49.566 --> 04:52.041
that you don't have
any groceries either?

04:52.208 --> 04:55.920
No, I left one of my study
guides upstairs before I left.

04:56.087 --> 04:57.463
But I'll grab coffee.

04:57.630 --> 05:00.300
- Feel like I never stop studying.
- Any more job offers?

05:00.466 --> 05:03.594
Yeah, three. Seattle,
Portland and Waikiki.

05:03.761 --> 05:06.389
- But still nothing close.
- Oh, take Waikiki.

05:06.556 --> 05:10.268
Doesn't anybody make breakfast
at their own home anymore?

05:10.435 --> 05:13.855
Hmm. Yours is better. And
with Simon traveling...

05:14.022 --> 05:16.774
to UCLA, I'm taking a
break from phrasal verbs...

05:16.941 --> 05:19.819
and adverbial clauses to try
to sell other people's words.

05:19.986 --> 05:24.907
Just be thankful it's not widgeon
grass, eelgrass, water stargrass...

05:25.074 --> 05:26.875
And hydrilla and wild celery.

05:26.876 --> 05:29.037
There are five underwater
grasses in the bay.

05:29.203 --> 05:32.332
- You're so smart.
- Why do you know that, Dad?

05:32.498 --> 05:35.626
- Tell your daughter she needs sleep.
- Abby, get sleep.

05:35.793 --> 05:37.628
Connor, you too.

05:37.795 --> 05:40.840
- Mom, we don't need more sleep.
- Speak for yourself.

05:41.007 --> 05:45.344
All right. I'm out of here.
Uh, thank you, Gran. Goodbye.

05:45.511 --> 05:49.599
What I need is to go wake up Carrie
and Caitlyn, and go to the park.

05:49.766 --> 05:52.477
- Wanna come?
- Can't. I'm meeting Kate Pragnell.

05:52.643 --> 05:54.562
- But I'll help you wake them up.
- Mm-hm.

05:54.729 --> 05:56.981
Watch your back with that Kate.

05:57.148 --> 05:59.984
You know, she is the
beloved mayor's assistant.

06:02.862 --> 06:07.492
Um... Before he left, Simon and
I finished editing my manuscript.

06:07.658 --> 06:10.703
Oh, that's wonderful,
Bree. Good for you.

06:10.870 --> 06:13.664
And, um, I'd like you to read it.

06:15.291 --> 06:18.127
- I think the time's right.
- I don't know that the time...

06:18.294 --> 06:23.091
is ever right for anything.
It's us people that make it so.

06:25.593 --> 06:29.639
Well, we could always do
tasting menu, or set-menu dinner.

06:29.806 --> 06:33.643
- Or if we get that bid to cater the regatta...
- We could start a catering business.

06:33.810 --> 06:36.729
Or we could do theme
weekends, murder mystery.

06:36.896 --> 06:39.899
It could be Colonel Mustard
with the pipe in the lavatory.

06:40.066 --> 06:41.859
I think you mean conservatory.

06:42.026 --> 06:44.862
We don't have a conservatory.
We could do medieval weekend.

06:45.029 --> 06:48.825
- You can be my knight in shining armor.
- I thought I already was.

06:48.991 --> 06:50.243
Yes, you are.

06:50.409 --> 06:52.870
This is gonna bring people
in during the off-season.

06:53.037 --> 06:56.124
- You know, you're very good at this.
- I am, aren't I?

06:56.290 --> 06:57.875
Ever think about Peck Enterprises?

06:58.042 --> 07:00.253
I heard the person who
was running it left.

07:00.419 --> 07:02.547
To pursue his true love.

07:02.713 --> 07:04.465
Really?

07:04.632 --> 07:06.217
Cooking.

07:10.763 --> 07:12.432
Hello, David.

07:13.558 --> 07:17.061
- Jess.
- Alexandra, what are you doing here?

07:17.812 --> 07:19.397
Uh...

07:19.814 --> 07:21.858
I brought s'mores. Heh.

07:22.316 --> 07:23.693
Oh.

07:24.110 --> 07:25.987
She brought s'mores.

07:26.696 --> 07:28.698
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

07:30.199 --> 07:34.370
That's it. I mean, Greg Lanier's
online books were all in order.

07:35.246 --> 07:36.497
But...

07:36.664 --> 07:41.419
But it appears he
falsified vendor invoices...

07:41.586 --> 07:45.173
paying out far more
than we ever received.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.966
So he pocketed the difference?

07:47.133 --> 07:50.261
He might have, or the
business got away from him...

07:50.845 --> 07:51.960
and he started funneling money

07:51.961 --> 07:54.891
from one place to the next to pay bills.

07:55.057 --> 07:56.267
How much is left?

07:59.854 --> 08:01.772
We took a huge hit, Mick.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.905
Mick?

08:09.489 --> 08:11.240
- Yeah.
- Heh.

08:11.407 --> 08:13.659
You're not saying anything.

08:15.036 --> 08:18.080
I'm just thinking about my options.

08:18.247 --> 08:19.582
You mean, our options.

08:19.749 --> 08:23.211
I mean, we're still partners, remember?

08:25.421 --> 08:28.090
I stayed a silent partner
because you were running the club.

08:28.257 --> 08:30.218
And I still am.

08:30.718 --> 08:32.929
I'll take care of this.

08:34.138 --> 08:37.725
Trace, when it comes
to my investments...

08:37.892 --> 08:39.684
I don't lose money silently.

08:48.945 --> 08:52.365
Mom, what are The Grapes of Wrath about?

08:52.532 --> 08:53.908
Uh, ahem.

08:54.075 --> 08:56.035
- Angry fruit.
- Mom. You're gonna find out soon.

08:58.329 --> 09:01.332
We'll buy that in seven years
when you read it in high school.

09:01.499 --> 09:03.876
- Seven years?
- That's coming sooner than you think.

09:04.043 --> 09:06.003
When it does, we'll buy the book.

09:06.170 --> 09:09.632
Hello. Hi, guys. Thank
you for watching the ship.

09:09.799 --> 09:12.843
Yeah, sure. Carrie and
Caitlyn did all the work.

09:13.010 --> 09:15.304
Hey, Abs, can I say something?

09:15.471 --> 09:16.764
Sure.

09:17.473 --> 09:19.225
You look really tired.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.519
Tired?

09:21.686 --> 09:23.396
Tired.

09:23.729 --> 09:28.818
No, I'm... Ahem. I'm
having a great summer.

09:28.985 --> 09:31.487
Carrie and Caitlyn,
they're having a blast.

09:31.654 --> 09:34.323
You know what Terri had
them do two weeks ago?

09:34.490 --> 09:38.911
She had all the girls decorate
their own headboards over at Wes's.

09:39.078 --> 09:40.705
That's awesome.

09:40.871 --> 09:43.207
And totally not a big deal.

09:43.374 --> 09:46.919
I mean, who doesn't have
personalized headboards, right?

09:47.086 --> 09:49.088
Right. Right.

09:49.255 --> 09:51.622
Headboards and Italian dinners and...

09:51.623 --> 09:54.010
Oh. You know what she also had them do?

09:54.176 --> 09:58.472
She took them on a private tour of
the National Zoo, so that was great.

09:58.639 --> 10:01.392
Hey, you're a great mom.

10:03.603 --> 10:06.480
Well, Wes and Terri's
house is Disneyland.

10:06.939 --> 10:09.692
- Mom?
- Yes.

10:09.859 --> 10:14.739
So today, we are going to
go on a backwards picnic.

10:14.905 --> 10:19.410
We are going to have
cupcakes before salad...

10:19.577 --> 10:22.079
and we are going to dry ourselves off...

10:22.246 --> 10:25.249
- before we get in the ocean.
- Abs, Abs, Abs.

10:25.416 --> 10:27.752
- You're trying too hard.
- This is what you do...

10:27.918 --> 10:29.879
when your life's going
backwards. Let's go.

10:30.046 --> 10:32.423
Don't walk into
anything. Beep-beep. Bye.

10:32.590 --> 10:34.884
- Bye.
- Bye.

10:35.051 --> 10:38.888
With the proceeds from the Art
Walk and the Sandcastle Festival...

10:39.055 --> 10:41.285
our reserves are now 30 percent higher

10:41.286 --> 10:43.560
than what was originally allocated.

10:43.726 --> 10:47.229
Megan, I can't tell you how
impressed Mayor Devine...

10:47.396 --> 10:49.899
- and I are with what you've been doing.
- Thank you.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.545
I'm thinking some of that money

10:51.546 --> 10:53.486
should be diverted
to elementary schools.

10:53.653 --> 10:56.238
- I've got some ideas...
- Which is why...

10:56.405 --> 10:58.783
it pains me to let you know that...

10:58.949 --> 11:02.161
Well, we'll be accepting
your resignation this Friday.

11:03.329 --> 11:04.372
My what?

11:04.538 --> 11:08.918
We appreciate the work you've done.
And we'll miss having you around.

11:09.085 --> 11:10.586
I'm being fired?

11:10.753 --> 11:13.172
Not fired. No, you're going to resign.

11:13.631 --> 11:16.003
The Arts Council's being
folded into another department.

11:16.004 --> 11:17.593
No need for your job.

11:17.760 --> 11:20.846
But the arts are so important.
They're crucial to how we express...

11:21.013 --> 11:24.558
Ourselves. Understand
the world, our pain.

11:24.725 --> 11:26.310
Uh-huh. Yeah.

11:26.477 --> 11:28.646
Which is why we're
giving it to Robby Monk.

11:28.813 --> 11:31.315
- Head of Parks and Rec.
- Monk?

11:31.482 --> 11:33.859
Monk argued for an hour that schools...

11:34.026 --> 11:36.904
should consider french
fries as vegetables.

11:37.071 --> 11:39.073
Technically, they are.

11:47.248 --> 11:50.751
No way we're stopping Hampstead
Industries from building on the bay.

11:50.918 --> 11:54.463
- Not with sign-offs from these agencies.
- So why did you agree to help?

11:54.630 --> 11:56.590
Mostly, our firm takes
cases based on merit.

11:56.757 --> 12:00.970
- Saving Chesapeake Bay's top of the list.
- That's mostly. What's partially?

12:01.137 --> 12:03.973
Considering all the Chinese
takeout we consumed...

12:04.140 --> 12:06.070
I like the irony that we've eaten

12:06.071 --> 12:09.186
more sweet-and-sour
shrimp than we'll save.

12:10.020 --> 12:13.023
There's a benefit to burying
a company in paperwork.

12:13.190 --> 12:16.110
I was pleasantly surprised to
hear Hampstead had to bring in...

12:16.277 --> 12:19.738
Pinero & Wade at 500 an
hour to handle the overload.

12:19.905 --> 12:21.949
If we can't win, make them suffer?

12:22.116 --> 12:24.618
It's sort of a family motto. Oh.

12:25.995 --> 12:27.746
So we've reviewed the material...

12:27.913 --> 12:31.292
and sympathize with your plight,
but your suit has no merit.

12:32.835 --> 12:34.462
Danielle.

12:35.296 --> 12:36.755
Ow.

12:39.550 --> 12:41.260
- Connor?
- Danielle.

12:49.477 --> 12:54.148
Ahem. You missed a great game
of mini golf with the girls.

12:54.315 --> 12:58.027
Yeah? I'm way too competitive.

12:58.194 --> 12:59.987
After the board games, heh...

13:00.154 --> 13:02.656
I don't think my ego
can take another loss.

13:02.823 --> 13:03.950
Well, it's probably good, then.

13:03.951 --> 13:07.912
Carrie and Caitlyn
got seven hole-in-ones.

13:08.078 --> 13:10.289
I'm thinking of putting
them on the pro tour.

13:10.456 --> 13:13.626
- There's professional mini golf?
- Mm. Mm-hm.

13:13.792 --> 13:17.004
- But the trophies are very tiny.
- Heh.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.798
I'm going through these invoices...

13:19.965 --> 13:23.052
matching them up with
the sales and back stock.

13:23.219 --> 13:25.179
And there's a huge discrepancy.

13:25.346 --> 13:28.224
Which is why I've been bouncing
checks the past three weeks.

13:28.390 --> 13:31.810
Right. And Greg took off
before you could figure it out.

13:31.977 --> 13:36.232
You know, I opened the Bridge so
people would have a place to come...

13:36.398 --> 13:39.860
and leave their cares at the
door, hear some great music.

13:40.027 --> 13:42.154
But by going out on tour...

13:42.321 --> 13:44.615
I might have just shut that door.

13:52.456 --> 13:54.708
Okay, O'Brien, you
stabilized him. What's next?

13:54.875 --> 13:56.418
Is he taking medication?

13:56.585 --> 13:58.295
- Baetril.
- Which is what?

13:58.462 --> 13:59.797
It's a chlorothiazide.

13:59.964 --> 14:02.716
- Had they recently adjusted his dosage?
- Yes.

14:03.634 --> 14:07.012
Low pressure can cause syncope.
He's gonna need to be worked on.

14:07.179 --> 14:09.223
- Nicely done.
- I'll let the ambulance know.

14:09.390 --> 14:11.600
- It's going to be okay.
- Thank you.

14:14.144 --> 14:16.272
Has anyone ever told you
you should be a paramedic?

14:16.438 --> 14:17.898
Yeah, you.

14:18.065 --> 14:20.276
And, well, everyone else.

14:20.442 --> 14:24.530
You're a good firefighter. Chesapeake
Shores is lucky to have you.

14:25.447 --> 14:27.449
Yeah, about that...

14:27.616 --> 14:33.080
I mean, if you're not gonna be near
here for work, I was thinking...

14:34.206 --> 14:37.668
What would you say if I
took a job in Philadelphia?

14:38.419 --> 14:41.005
- What?
- Yeah, I've been applying...

14:41.171 --> 14:44.091
for three years for the
Philadelphia Fire Department...

14:44.258 --> 14:49.138
so that I can be closer to my
family, and they just accepted me.

14:57.104 --> 15:00.566
So I'm confused, should I increase
our holdings in Castellano Imports?

15:00.733 --> 15:01.851
Yeah. By 10 percent.

15:01.852 --> 15:04.987
Make sure you use our existing
preferred stock options.

15:05.154 --> 15:07.948
- Hedging them with the other class Bs.
- Bingo.

15:08.115 --> 15:10.075
- You're so good.
- So are you.

15:10.242 --> 15:12.620
- You picked it up faster.
- Your marshmallow's on fire.

15:12.786 --> 15:14.788
- Oh.
- It's okay.

15:14.955 --> 15:16.665
Good thing I brought some more.

15:16.832 --> 15:17.875
Ooh.

15:18.042 --> 15:20.377
Maybe Peck Enterprises
should invest in s'mores.

15:20.544 --> 15:23.672
- What do you think, David?
- That's up to you now.

15:25.925 --> 15:30.012
- Alexandra, how long are you in town?
- Just for a few days.

15:30.179 --> 15:33.223
And Mom and Dad were
okay with you coming?

15:33.641 --> 15:38.103
Actually, they didn't want
me to, but I needed to talk.

15:38.729 --> 15:42.232
I thought the job would be
easier. Being you would be easier.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.945
I need help.

15:47.571 --> 15:52.701
David, can you help me get some
more marshmallows from the kitchen?

15:52.868 --> 15:54.620
I mean, graham crackers.

15:54.787 --> 15:58.415
I, uh... I can't reach
them. One sec, guys.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.169
- You should come by the bookstore.
- Love to.

16:02.336 --> 16:05.547
Perhaps I'm still mildly
insecure with your family...

16:05.714 --> 16:08.008
but I think Alexandra
is up to something.

16:08.175 --> 16:09.885
Why? She just seems overwhelmed.

16:10.052 --> 16:12.513
What if she isn't and your
parents are using her...

16:12.680 --> 16:15.349
to lure you home and this
whole thing is just bait?

16:15.516 --> 16:17.685
Jess, I trust my sister.

16:17.851 --> 16:20.562
Okay, but if she's
here for that dress...

16:20.729 --> 16:22.773
we got problems.

16:24.775 --> 16:27.069
Okay, your day smoked mine.

16:27.236 --> 16:30.614
I'd have to run into a lot of
ex-girlfriends to beat saving a life.

16:30.781 --> 16:32.870
- It was no big deal.
- You gotta stop saying that.

16:32.871 --> 16:34.871
Every time somebody saves
a life, it is a big deal.

16:36.203 --> 16:39.957
Okay. So how was it
running into Danielle?

16:40.666 --> 16:42.543
It's also a pretty big deal.

16:42.710 --> 16:44.169
- She looked good.
- Yeah?

16:45.170 --> 16:47.423
Is she still dating her ex-boyfriend?

16:47.589 --> 16:48.966
Is she seeing anyone else?

16:49.133 --> 16:51.969
This might sound crazy, but
a room full of attorneys...

16:52.136 --> 16:55.597
kind of puts a damper
on the discovery process.

16:55.764 --> 16:58.308
Well, sometimes the discovery
process is overrated.

16:59.184 --> 17:01.729
Sarah told me today that
she might be transferring...

17:01.895 --> 17:04.940
- to the Philadelphia Fire Department.
- That's a tough one.

17:05.398 --> 17:07.943
What's really tough is I
can't tell her not to go...

17:08.109 --> 17:11.113
- because I don't know where I'll be.
- What are you gonna do?

17:11.280 --> 17:13.240
- I don't know.
- What's up, guys?

17:13.406 --> 17:15.534
- Hey.
- Hey, Trace.

17:15.951 --> 17:17.578
You bussing tables?

17:17.744 --> 17:20.664
Yeah, we're, uh, having
some scheduling problems.

17:20.830 --> 17:23.041
Gotta do what you gotta do, right?

17:23.208 --> 17:26.002
I tended bar in law school.
Need somebody to run barback...

17:26.170 --> 17:28.922
- for an hour, I could help.
- No, we're doing all right.

17:29.089 --> 17:31.175
You obviously need help. I'm offering.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.969
I won't even charge
you my current hourly.

17:34.136 --> 17:35.888
That's real generous of you.

17:38.515 --> 17:40.434
Okay, cool. Thanks.

17:40.601 --> 17:42.061
No problem.

17:46.273 --> 17:48.567
So, uh, Abby mentioned...

17:48.734 --> 17:51.987
you saved someone's life
this morning, Kev. Nice going.

17:52.154 --> 17:54.198
Word travels fast
around the O'Brien house.

17:54.364 --> 17:56.784
Honestly, it's no big deal.

17:56.950 --> 18:00.162
Yeah, she said you'd say that too.
Can I at least buy you a drink?

18:00.329 --> 18:02.664
No, I should probably head back.

18:02.831 --> 18:04.500
Got some studying to do.

18:04.666 --> 18:07.086
Some stuff to figure out.

18:07.252 --> 18:10.214
Sarah. She might be moving. Philly.

18:11.465 --> 18:14.802
Sorry to hear it.
That's... That's tough.

18:14.968 --> 18:17.721
I don't know how the long-distance
thing is gonna work out.

18:17.888 --> 18:20.099
You and Abby, you guys
make it work, right?

18:20.265 --> 18:23.185
We're, uh, still figuring it out.

18:25.395 --> 18:26.855
Ah.

18:27.731 --> 18:30.025
- Maybe I will take that drink.
- Heh.

18:30.192 --> 18:31.610
Figured as much.

18:40.953 --> 18:46.917
Isn't Robby Monk the man who was
blaming last year's early snowfall...

18:47.084 --> 18:48.877
on the Battle of Waterloo?

18:49.044 --> 18:51.341
Yup. And the same one who thought

18:51.342 --> 18:53.465
Salvador Dalí is the
Dalai Lama's brother.

18:53.632 --> 18:56.343
The only reason this
man even has a job...

18:56.510 --> 19:01.026
is to keep the people away from
the beloved Mayor Frank Devine.

19:01.030 --> 19:02.146
Which is why I can't understand

19:02.147 --> 19:05.227
why the mayor is putting
him in charge of...

19:07.646 --> 19:10.983
He can't be going after
me to get to you, can he?

19:11.567 --> 19:13.110
I believe he might be.

19:18.657 --> 19:21.118
I just think you're being
too hard on yourself.

19:21.285 --> 19:25.164
- You know what you're doing.
- It's not that. It's just...

19:25.747 --> 19:29.793
I spent so many years resenting
you for everything you had.

19:29.960 --> 19:33.547
Everything you didn't want. And
now I'm coming to you for help.

19:33.922 --> 19:36.049
I didn't know that.

19:36.216 --> 19:38.552
But I'm your brother.

19:38.719 --> 19:40.554
I know.

19:40.721 --> 19:44.391
But me being here means
Mom and Dad are right.

19:44.558 --> 19:45.809
You are better at this.

19:45.976 --> 19:49.188
Alex, you've only been running
the company for two weeks.

19:49.354 --> 19:51.231
Just give it time.

19:51.398 --> 19:55.819
And this. This all looks
amazing. Seriously, wow.

19:55.986 --> 19:57.029
Oh, I know.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.160
Mom and Dad should be encouraging you...

19:59.161 --> 20:00.721
and helping you to figure all this out.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.702
Because, you know, that's
what Dad did for me.

20:04.244 --> 20:06.705
It's almost as if they're
setting me up to fail.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.124
Maybe they are.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.710
Maybe.

20:12.544 --> 20:15.297
I just wish the family
would sit down and talk.

20:15.464 --> 20:17.925
If it makes you feel better,
we don't do that either.

20:18.091 --> 20:21.762
Our family stays together
because of the things left unsaid.

20:22.888 --> 20:24.264
So let's not do that.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.309
Alex, let me help you.

20:28.810 --> 20:29.978
I'd like that.

20:34.399 --> 20:37.194
Yeah, you better push
the Miami deal. Uh-huh.

20:37.361 --> 20:39.154
Stuck here another week.

20:39.321 --> 20:42.074
- Okay, good. Thanks. Hey.
- Hey, Mick.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.534
I spent last night on the
phone with our vendors.

20:44.701 --> 20:47.216
- They'll float us another two months.
- How bad is it?

20:47.617 --> 20:49.780
We're in a big hole.

20:49.781 --> 20:51.950
It's gonna take six
months to make it back.

20:52.125 --> 20:55.462
In the meantime, the police
are looking for Lanier.

20:55.629 --> 20:58.006
And this should cover what
he took, plus interest.

20:58.173 --> 21:01.343
Greg was my hire, it was on
my watch, I'll make it right.

21:01.510 --> 21:04.346
I can't take that, Trace.
I'm not taking that.

21:04.513 --> 21:07.557
When we went into business
together, I put up the money...

21:07.724 --> 21:10.185
and you put up the
expertise, which made sense.

21:10.352 --> 21:11.520
That was the deal.

21:11.687 --> 21:15.482
And I was okay with you leaving
as long as you kept up your end.

21:15.649 --> 21:17.609
Mick, it's all good.

21:17.776 --> 21:20.988
- I'm handling it.
- You are. Because you have integrity.

21:21.154 --> 21:23.532
Which is why I went
into business with you.

21:23.699 --> 21:26.243
Great. Well, I'm interviewing
managers this afternoon.

21:26.410 --> 21:28.453
We're setting up a
new accounting system.

21:28.620 --> 21:31.123
That's not what I'm saying.
What I'm saying is...

21:31.290 --> 21:33.542
you can't promise it
won't happen again...

21:33.709 --> 21:36.503
because you may not be
here to see that it doesn't.

21:36.670 --> 21:40.590
Look, when I go into business
with somebody, it's face to face.

21:40.757 --> 21:42.175
That's not what's going on.

21:42.342 --> 21:44.845
You've been running
this place in absentia.

21:45.012 --> 21:47.090
I've lost more money
canceling meetings in New York

21:47.091 --> 21:48.557
than I'll get back here.

21:48.724 --> 21:50.684
No matter how long
this place stays open.

21:51.143 --> 21:54.688
So if we're keeping the
club... And I do wanna keep it.

21:54.855 --> 21:57.858
from now on, we do it my way.

22:01.737 --> 22:03.822
That's not what we agreed to.

22:03.989 --> 22:06.616
I think you should take
another look at the contract.

22:06.783 --> 22:09.161
That's exactly what we agreed to.

22:18.587 --> 22:20.922
After going over the
most recent proposal...

22:21.089 --> 22:24.301
I'm still bumping on the
repetitive aspects of the deal.

22:24.468 --> 22:26.970
Yes. I'm sorry for the late notes...

22:27.137 --> 22:29.931
but I'm going to need
a clean copy tomorrow.

22:30.098 --> 22:32.184
Yes. Okay, thank you. Yeah.

22:32.350 --> 22:34.770
Abby. I was just coming to see you.

22:34.936 --> 22:37.355
- Oh, yeah.
- How's the Remington deal going?

22:37.522 --> 22:41.526
Uh, it's not quite ready, but
I will have it done later today.

22:42.444 --> 22:44.821
If you're falling behind,
we can always, uh...

22:44.988 --> 22:46.531
No, it's fine. I'm fine.

22:46.698 --> 22:49.201
It's just not like
you to push deadlines.

22:49.367 --> 22:51.787
Well, I'm working on it now, so...

22:52.245 --> 22:55.123
If something's going on you
wanna talk about, we can.

22:56.500 --> 22:58.543
No, I'm... I'm good, thanks. Sorry.

22:58.710 --> 23:01.671
Hi, honey. Uh-huh.

23:01.838 --> 23:04.299
Yeah. No, no, no, it's
okay. What's going on?

23:04.466 --> 23:06.259
Well, what's wrong?

23:08.845 --> 23:10.180
Thank you.

23:12.516 --> 23:15.977
I can't believe people actually
read either of the Caroline books.

23:16.144 --> 23:18.855
- I know. Me neither.
- Especially since The Red Palace...

23:19.022 --> 23:22.109
- was so good.
- You read Simon Atwater's first book?

23:22.275 --> 23:23.819
Twice.

23:23.985 --> 23:27.531
And then I DM'd him and gushed
about what a huge fan I was.

23:28.448 --> 23:29.991
He never responded.

23:30.826 --> 23:35.705
Well, I, uh, think he might
be a little busy these days.

23:39.042 --> 23:41.419
Wait, you know Simon Atwater?

23:42.170 --> 23:44.172
You could say that.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.633
No.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.343
You and Simon, you're not...

23:48.510 --> 23:51.763
Well, I mean, we are
kind of on round two.

23:52.305 --> 23:55.934
Round one was... Didn't end very well.

23:56.101 --> 23:58.228
Okay, I am beyond jealous right now.

23:58.395 --> 24:00.772
Not just about Simon, but this.

24:00.939 --> 24:03.483
- All of this.
- You know what?

24:03.650 --> 24:07.112
- The grass is always greener.
- I know, I'm just...

24:07.279 --> 24:09.614
I'm so overwhelmed right now.

24:09.781 --> 24:11.867
I've always been envious of David.

24:12.033 --> 24:15.787
Not just for what he's done,
but for being able to walk away.

24:15.954 --> 24:17.372
I mean...

24:17.539 --> 24:20.041
I want to run the company, I do.

24:20.208 --> 24:22.460
It's just a lot tougher than I thought.

24:22.627 --> 24:27.007
And especially with my parents
looking over my shoulder all the time.

24:27.174 --> 24:29.551
Sometimes it's easier
being invisible, isn't it?

24:31.386 --> 24:32.470
Sometimes.

24:33.889 --> 24:36.433
Which is why it was so
nice having you around.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.602
Both of you.

24:39.227 --> 24:41.646
It was like having sisters.

24:43.565 --> 24:45.233
Yeah.

24:49.821 --> 24:52.115
Kate.

24:52.866 --> 24:55.076
I think we got off on the wrong foot.

24:55.243 --> 24:56.870
No, I think it went perfectly.

24:57.454 --> 25:00.207
Was there anything you didn't
understand when we last met?

25:00.373 --> 25:03.043
Well, I understood the resignation part.

25:03.210 --> 25:05.212
I just don't understand the motivation.

25:05.962 --> 25:08.715
Robby Monk is a very impressive...

25:08.882 --> 25:10.717
Cut it, Kate.

25:11.968 --> 25:13.762
Nell O'Brien. What a...

25:13.929 --> 25:16.431
Pleasure it is to see me, isn't it?

25:17.140 --> 25:20.435
How long have your mother
and I known each other?

25:20.894 --> 25:25.190
It is going on 35 years.

25:25.357 --> 25:26.942
Thirty-five years.

25:27.108 --> 25:31.947
Nell, you can't guilt me, and
you can't tempt me with muffins.

25:32.113 --> 25:35.075
Then at least let us know why
you're choosing Robby Monk.

25:35.242 --> 25:37.535
Robby has been working
for the city for 20 years.

25:37.702 --> 25:40.747
Kate, Robby confuses
pop art with Pop-Tarts.

25:41.331 --> 25:42.791
He's not qualified.

25:42.958 --> 25:46.628
Megan, this has nothing to do with you.

25:46.795 --> 25:51.299
No, it has to do with me, doesn't it?

25:51.841 --> 25:54.261
Tell the truth.

25:55.679 --> 25:57.722
Thought you were doing wills and trusts.

25:57.889 --> 25:59.690
There was an opening in
environmental, so I took it.

25:59.691 --> 26:01.685
And what about you?

26:01.851 --> 26:03.812
This isn't an O'Brien Foundation case.

26:03.979 --> 26:07.107
We were contacted by Erica's
firm, and my uncle wanted me to...

26:07.274 --> 26:10.610
- I don't know, create a little havoc.
- Well, that's all you can do.

26:10.777 --> 26:12.654
Hampstead has every right to build.

26:12.821 --> 26:16.199
Everyone from the Chesapeake
Bay Environmental Agency to...

26:16.366 --> 26:19.369
the Maryland Department of
the Environment is behind us.

26:19.536 --> 26:21.830
You just don't have a case.

26:23.498 --> 26:25.750
That just doesn't sound like you.

26:25.917 --> 26:28.753
Oh, because this is the me
that's gunning for a partnership.

26:28.920 --> 26:31.172
Thanks to you, I'm racking
up hundreds of hours.

26:31.339 --> 26:33.008
Yeah. Me too.

26:33.174 --> 26:35.552
And on top of that,
spending time with my dad...

26:35.719 --> 26:37.595
restoring his sailboat on the bay.

26:38.096 --> 26:40.181
Really? You and your dad?

26:40.348 --> 26:42.642
I know, right? Never say never.

26:43.059 --> 26:44.894
I guess so.

26:46.521 --> 26:48.815
- See you.
- See you.

26:50.608 --> 26:53.361
I'm guessing she broke up with you.

26:53.528 --> 26:54.821
What? No.

26:57.073 --> 27:01.119
- Okay, how could you tell?
- Because she looks like she regrets it.

27:01.286 --> 27:02.662
Oh.

27:03.496 --> 27:05.707
She's gonna regret this more.

27:06.416 --> 27:10.837
She mentioned only state and
local agencies had signed off.

27:11.421 --> 27:13.631
She didn't mention
anything about the feds.

27:13.798 --> 27:16.009
Maybe it was an oversight.

27:16.426 --> 27:19.012
Maybe it was a smokescreen.

27:19.512 --> 27:22.640
She didn't mention the feds
because maybe they didn't sign off.

27:22.807 --> 27:25.143
So you weren't just catching up?

27:25.310 --> 27:27.395
No. Never when I'm working.

27:27.562 --> 27:29.356
And what cards did you show her?

27:29.522 --> 27:32.901
Nothing. Talked about my dad and a boat.

27:33.360 --> 27:36.863
Which takes care of the roses,
leading us to the daisy family.

27:37.030 --> 27:41.201
Okay, there's Shasta,
gloriosa, marguerite.

27:41.368 --> 27:43.453
- Wait, what about this one?
- Gerbera.

27:43.620 --> 27:45.914
I am shocked you know
so much about daisies.

27:46.081 --> 27:48.208
- You can thank my dad. Mm-hm.
- Your dad?

27:48.375 --> 27:51.669
Really? Fire captain,
ex-Navy SEAL, florist.

27:53.338 --> 27:55.276
For the last 40 years, every Monday,

27:55.277 --> 27:56.925
my dad would bring flowers for my mom.

27:57.092 --> 28:00.637
So he's kind of an expert. No pressure.

28:00.804 --> 28:03.973
None at all, I'd love it if you
brought me flowers every Monday.

28:04.140 --> 28:06.518
Well, maybe we can take turns.

28:07.977 --> 28:10.021
Sarah, I don't know what to do.

28:13.817 --> 28:15.860
Me neither.

28:17.195 --> 28:21.324
Excuse me, are you the man who
helped save my husband's life?

28:21.491 --> 28:23.576
Yes. Right. How is he?

28:23.743 --> 28:26.913
You were right. It was his
medication, not his heart.

28:27.080 --> 28:29.207
Right. It was the chlorothiazide.

28:29.374 --> 28:31.751
- Yeah.
- Yeah. So they adjusted his dose?

28:31.918 --> 28:33.086
Yes, they did.

28:33.253 --> 28:35.547
- Thank you.
- Oh.

28:37.715 --> 28:39.175
Can't leave without a gerbera.

28:41.511 --> 28:44.556
And an expert on flowers too? Huh.

28:44.723 --> 28:47.058
- You should hang onto this one.
- Heh.

28:53.857 --> 28:56.776
But I don't understand. You're
gonna be back in two months.

28:56.943 --> 28:58.194
I know.

28:58.361 --> 29:00.530
Why wouldn't he just
hire someone temporarily?

29:00.697 --> 29:02.365
Your guess is as good as mine.

29:03.783 --> 29:07.704
- Do you want me to talk to him for you?
- No, no, no. It's okay.

29:07.871 --> 29:09.539
Honestly, I'm not surprised.

29:09.706 --> 29:13.084
I've been around your father long
enough to know the turn was coming.

29:13.251 --> 29:15.044
There have always been two Micks.

29:15.211 --> 29:20.091
- One who's all about family...
- And the one who's all business? Heh.

29:20.258 --> 29:22.218
Yeah, that sounds familiar.

29:22.385 --> 29:25.597
Apparently, the apple doesn't
fall far from the tree.

29:27.557 --> 29:29.142
Hey.

29:29.726 --> 29:31.686
Do you remember...

29:31.853 --> 29:34.022
in high school, I made that list...

29:34.189 --> 29:36.691
of all the things I was
gonna be when I grew up?

29:36.858 --> 29:39.611
And I was gonna be the
president of the United States...

29:39.778 --> 29:43.156
- and a billionaire, a scientist...
- I remember. It was quite a list.

29:43.323 --> 29:46.534
- Very, very ambitious.
- Yeah.

29:47.076 --> 29:50.538
After 15 years, I've come
to terms with the fact...

29:50.705 --> 29:52.590
that I've taken most of
those things off the list,

29:52.591 --> 29:54.876
and I'm fine with that.

29:56.419 --> 30:00.089
But I just always thought that I
would be good at least one or two.

30:00.256 --> 30:02.091
Are you serious?

30:02.425 --> 30:04.844
Abby, you're great at your job...

30:05.011 --> 30:07.180
and you're a great mother.

30:07.680 --> 30:09.474
And I love you.

30:11.476 --> 30:13.394
Thank you. Mm.

30:13.561 --> 30:15.480
I love you.

30:16.064 --> 30:17.732
Come on.

30:25.365 --> 30:27.450
Two whiskey rocks.

30:28.618 --> 30:29.965
You look like you could use some coffee.

30:29.966 --> 30:32.300
Hope that doesn't have to do with me.

30:32.455 --> 30:36.000
No, it's this huge environmental
case coming down to the final hour.

30:36.167 --> 30:37.836
One coffee coming right up.

30:38.002 --> 30:39.754
- I'll take it to go.
- Got it.

30:39.921 --> 30:42.507
So I took a look at your contract.

30:42.674 --> 30:45.635
It's pretty clear you agreed
to be the on-site manager.

30:45.802 --> 30:48.388
What, that's it?
There's nothing I can do?

30:50.223 --> 30:52.100
Listen, Trace...

30:52.267 --> 30:55.854
just so you know, I'm not
gonna go against my dad again.

30:56.020 --> 30:59.524
I mean, we're good right now.

31:00.066 --> 31:01.651
But...

31:02.235 --> 31:04.237
it's never nothing.

31:05.363 --> 31:10.493
Contracts are always
open to interpretation.

31:19.419 --> 31:20.920
Hm.

31:21.671 --> 31:23.882
Coffee's on the house.

31:25.008 --> 31:26.801
See you later.

31:33.349 --> 31:35.310
Okay, so first s'mores and now this.

31:35.476 --> 31:37.186
I'm going to gain 10 pounds.

31:37.353 --> 31:39.856
Oh, no, no, in Chesapeake
Shores, calories don't count.

31:40.023 --> 31:43.526
- I might have to move here.
- You could be an honorary O'Brien sister.

31:43.693 --> 31:46.112
- We share ice cream and problems.
- Hmm.

31:46.279 --> 31:49.282
That's sweet, but I think
I've overshared enough already.

31:49.449 --> 31:50.742
Well, then I'll go.

31:50.909 --> 31:53.620
I messed up at work today.

31:53.786 --> 31:55.663
No, you didn't.

31:55.830 --> 31:59.542
I did. I missed a deadline,
which I have never done before.

31:59.709 --> 32:02.503
Okay, missing deadlines
doesn't mean messing up.

32:02.962 --> 32:05.378
Yes, it does, actually.

32:05.379 --> 32:08.700
I just... Ahem. I'm trying
to be great at my job...

32:08.801 --> 32:11.721
and a great mom, and I'm
not doing either one well.

32:11.888 --> 32:13.139
Okay, but you're Abby.

32:13.306 --> 32:16.351
Your 50 percent is off the
charts for a normal human.

32:17.060 --> 32:20.104
Thank you, but this time
telling me how great I am...

32:20.271 --> 32:22.857
I don't think is gonna
make me feel any better.

32:23.483 --> 32:26.527
- I don't think John Steinbeck will either.
- No.

32:26.694 --> 32:28.404
Here, open.

32:28.571 --> 32:32.075
When you said to Caitlyn that you
were gonna buy this in seven years...

32:32.241 --> 32:34.619
she wrote a note and asked
me to keep it for her.

32:34.786 --> 32:38.331
- Really?
- I think you should read it right now.

32:39.624 --> 32:41.167
Okay.

32:42.669 --> 32:45.546
"Dear Mom, when you get this,
I'll be in high school...

32:45.713 --> 32:50.635
and if I'm too big to tell you
then, I just wanna tell you...

32:50.802 --> 32:54.973
that I will always love
you, forever and forever.

32:55.139 --> 32:56.724
Love, Caitlyn."

32:58.685 --> 33:01.062
I think you're doing just fine.

33:01.229 --> 33:02.271
Come in here.

33:02.981 --> 33:05.316
- You want my ice cream?
- Yeah.

33:08.111 --> 33:11.781
If you'd like, I could
talk to our mayor.

33:12.865 --> 33:17.662
- I have a feeling that won't go well.
- Oh, that's the idea.

33:18.246 --> 33:19.455
You think it'd help?

33:19.622 --> 33:24.168
I don't know, but at the very
least, it'd be quite entertaining.

33:26.295 --> 33:27.588
I'm not gonna resign.

33:27.755 --> 33:29.257
I don't think you should.

33:29.424 --> 33:32.260
They want me out, they'll have
to figure out a way to fire me.

33:32.427 --> 33:35.972
Maybe you could have a
heart-to-heart talk with Robby Monk.

33:36.723 --> 33:39.517
We'd be one heart short.

33:39.684 --> 33:46.274
Oh. Megan, this town is lucky
to have you, and so are we.

33:52.905 --> 33:53.990
Nell?

33:54.699 --> 33:57.118
Sometimes in life...

33:57.285 --> 34:00.580
you hear things that are difficult...

34:00.997 --> 34:04.500
and you know it's going
to be hard to move on.

34:05.043 --> 34:07.545
But you have to.

34:08.545 --> 34:10.757
What are we talking about?

34:12.842 --> 34:14.010
Bree's book.

34:15.719 --> 34:16.971
You should read it.

34:29.317 --> 34:30.735
Jess around?

34:30.902 --> 34:34.447
No, she's off with Bree and
my sister, doing something.

34:34.614 --> 34:36.699
- Nobody's answering their phones.
- Huh.

34:36.866 --> 34:38.868
Hey, you know anything
about wood siding?

34:39.034 --> 34:42.330
Uh... A little bit. Usually
when it's on fire, though.

34:43.121 --> 34:45.666
Then you know more than I do.

34:46.292 --> 34:49.879
Hey, I heard about that guy
you helped save at Sally's.

34:50.045 --> 34:52.632
- And that it was no big deal.
- Yeah.

34:55.885 --> 34:57.428
You like working here?

34:58.054 --> 35:00.511
You could be running a
company. Living in a mansion.

35:00.512 --> 35:02.683
Gave that up for Jess, huh?

35:03.184 --> 35:04.852
Well, yeah, um...

35:05.019 --> 35:07.688
Jess was a big part of it...

35:08.272 --> 35:10.455
but I left because I
didn't wanna be doing that

35:10.456 --> 35:12.016
for the rest of my life.

35:12.193 --> 35:13.486
Yeah.

35:13.653 --> 35:15.822
You decided where you're gonna go?

35:15.988 --> 35:18.699
Not yet. See, that's
kind of the problem.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.244
- Sarah's going to Philly.
- Mm.

35:21.410 --> 35:23.663
And if I wanna stay with her, then...

35:23.830 --> 35:25.331
Can't be a paramedic.

35:26.499 --> 35:27.721
Yeah, that's rough.

35:27.722 --> 35:30.336
I don't know what I would
do if I couldn't be a cook.

35:30.962 --> 35:32.338
Yeah.

35:32.505 --> 35:36.175
Oh. Speaking of which,
my tourtiere is ready.

35:36.342 --> 35:38.302
- You hungry?
- Always.

35:38.469 --> 35:41.013
You know, I actually do a
little bit of cooking myself.

35:41.180 --> 35:43.850
Yeah, I heard about your
mac and cheese and meatballs.

35:44.016 --> 35:45.768
Yeah? You want the recipe?

35:45.935 --> 35:47.061
No.

35:54.902 --> 35:56.612
- Hey.
- Hi.

35:57.572 --> 36:01.450
- Just like old times, huh?
- First one up gets Dad to themselves.

36:01.617 --> 36:04.328
- Oh, that's why you did it.
- Mm-hm.

36:04.704 --> 36:08.791
Well, with five siblings, it was a
way to pretend I was an only child.

36:10.293 --> 36:12.795
Noticed you're putting
less milk in your coffee.

36:12.962 --> 36:16.215
Well, that's because
I need more caffeine.

36:17.258 --> 36:18.885
I thought you missed your trip.

36:19.051 --> 36:22.138
I did. I gotta fly to Boston
for some job interviews.

36:22.305 --> 36:24.056
- I'm hiring a new employee.
- Hmm.

36:24.640 --> 36:27.226
Contractor, accountant?

36:27.393 --> 36:29.353
Um... Waffles.

36:31.230 --> 36:33.900
- Long story.
- Heh.

36:35.902 --> 36:38.487
You know, it never gets easier.

36:38.654 --> 36:41.032
After all these years,
nothing makes me happier...

36:41.199 --> 36:43.326
than giving someone an opportunity...

36:43.492 --> 36:47.246
and nothing feels worse than
having to let somebody go.

36:48.915 --> 36:50.541
Really?

36:51.459 --> 36:52.960
What?

36:53.502 --> 36:55.467
No. You just never said that before.

36:55.468 --> 36:58.050
I always thought it was just business.

36:58.549 --> 37:00.176
Oh, no.

37:00.843 --> 37:01.886
No.

37:02.053 --> 37:05.848
You let go of an employee, it's like
you're taking away a part of them.

37:06.766 --> 37:09.977
For most of us, it's...
It's part of our identity.

37:15.816 --> 37:18.694
- How's Trace doing?
- Mm.

37:18.861 --> 37:19.946
Fine.

37:20.112 --> 37:21.155
Why?

37:22.657 --> 37:24.575
Just be there for him, okay?

37:43.803 --> 37:45.750
I've included all my private notes

37:45.751 --> 37:47.473
on our American and European holdings.

37:47.640 --> 37:50.309
If there's a dispute
at our Harkness Labs...

37:50.476 --> 37:52.812
you wanna get Hayley
or Shelby's support.

37:52.979 --> 37:54.438
Get them, you get the rest.

37:54.605 --> 37:57.566
And for DeBoer Technologies,
I'm guessing Charlotte.

37:58.150 --> 37:59.819
Exactly.

37:59.986 --> 38:02.029
Alex, you're doing great.

38:02.196 --> 38:06.033
And if you need me, I'm here. Just
call or even come back and visit.

38:06.575 --> 38:09.578
- Really?
- Yeah, of course.

38:09.745 --> 38:11.539
We're family.

38:12.540 --> 38:15.459
And if, um, Mom and Dad
want to come visit...

38:15.626 --> 38:18.254
It might be a while, but maybe one day.

38:20.798 --> 38:22.675
Hope I didn't mess things up too bad.

38:22.842 --> 38:26.220
Jess, you didn't break anything
that wasn't already broken.

38:26.846 --> 38:29.890
And I really do love your auberge.

38:30.975 --> 38:32.727
We do too.

38:37.440 --> 38:38.691
- Thank you.
- Bye.

38:42.570 --> 38:44.113
So when you see Dad...

38:52.455 --> 38:54.749
I have to get back to the office.

38:54.915 --> 38:56.584
I will not resign.

38:57.376 --> 39:00.296
- Wait. What?
- No.

39:00.921 --> 39:02.590
- I refuse.
- Why?

39:03.215 --> 39:04.842
Because you're wrong.

39:05.009 --> 39:06.886
Because the mayor is wrong, Kate.

39:07.053 --> 39:10.389
Because Robby is not
capable of doing this job.

39:10.556 --> 39:15.186
Because I love art.

39:15.353 --> 39:17.188
And I dislike bullies.

39:18.189 --> 39:20.232
- And one more thing.
- Oh, there's more?

39:20.399 --> 39:23.694
Yes. I'm guessing you didn't
fire me because you can't.

39:24.236 --> 39:26.947
And asking me to resign
was your way around it.

39:27.114 --> 39:28.949
That's not exactly the case.

39:29.116 --> 39:31.295
If I don't leave, you
and Robby will just have

39:31.296 --> 39:33.162
to enjoy a little art in your life.

39:33.329 --> 39:36.415
Who knows, Kate? Maybe
you'll come to appreciate it.

39:37.541 --> 39:41.420
So you can tell our beloved
mayor that the wish fountain...

39:41.587 --> 39:43.422
is not going anywhere.

39:43.589 --> 39:46.133
And neither am I.

39:53.057 --> 39:55.601
You'll find certification
from the State of Maryland...

39:55.768 --> 39:59.063
and four other local agencies
which accept the restrictions.

39:59.230 --> 40:03.275
I'd like my second chair to
respond to that, Ms. Clayman.

40:04.652 --> 40:07.238
You found it. You can
break the good news.

40:10.908 --> 40:13.619
Ms. Clayman, while state
and local agencies...

40:13.786 --> 40:17.665
may have signed off, the land
is part of the Atlantic Flyway.

40:17.832 --> 40:21.752
And essential ground for nine
migratory species of bird.

40:21.919 --> 40:26.924
Including the bald eagle. All of
which fall under federal jurisdiction.

40:27.091 --> 40:30.594
And since federal law
supersedes state and local...

40:30.761 --> 40:34.974
instead of us trying to stop you,
you should be trying to stop us.

40:35.975 --> 40:38.811
Or, more specifically, the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service...

40:38.978 --> 40:41.397
who will be filing suit against you.

40:41.772 --> 40:42.982
Next week.

40:43.149 --> 40:45.776
Right, next week.

40:53.033 --> 40:55.661
All right, we'll run the
remaining quarterlies tomorrow.

40:55.828 --> 40:58.038
Thank you for your report, Abby.

40:58.205 --> 41:00.583
Let's meet up again in an hour.

41:02.543 --> 41:05.087
- Everything back to normal?
- Uh...

41:05.254 --> 41:07.214
- Yes. As much as can be.
- Great.

41:07.381 --> 41:10.676
You have a new client. She
requested you personally.

41:10.843 --> 41:14.847
Her name is Terri Ingram, but
you might know her as Ms. Marvel.

41:19.560 --> 41:22.563
We're working the numbers. This
is an estimate of daily losses.

41:22.730 --> 41:23.898
This shows a breakdown.

41:24.064 --> 41:25.941
Can you tell me how far back this goes?

41:26.108 --> 41:28.402
- That's the part I don't get.
- Mick.

41:29.153 --> 41:32.072
- Who are they?
- They're going over the books.

41:32.239 --> 41:33.742
I've hired a firm that specializes

41:33.743 --> 41:35.993
in restaurant accounting and management.

41:36.160 --> 41:38.454
Trace, this is Chris.

41:38.621 --> 41:40.539
Chris, this is Trace Riley, my partner.

41:40.706 --> 41:43.167
Pleasure to meet you, Trace.
From my understanding...

41:43.334 --> 41:45.753
you're the one who loves country music.

41:48.047 --> 41:50.925
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

41:51.091 --> 41:53.260
Look, I know you have
the right to do this...

41:53.427 --> 41:55.930
I know you think you're
doing what's best...

41:56.096 --> 41:59.183
but I'm only gonna be gone
for another two months.

41:59.350 --> 42:01.477
Can you promise me that?

42:09.902 --> 42:13.405
All right, enjoy Huck Finn.
It's one of my favorites.

42:16.909 --> 42:18.786
- Hi, Gran.
- Good morning, Bree.

42:19.495 --> 42:24.792
I have come to see the grandchild
who has a lovely way with words.

42:24.959 --> 42:27.711
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

42:29.463 --> 42:31.382
That feels like half a response.

42:31.549 --> 42:33.130
Well, that's because I know the reason

42:33.131 --> 42:36.011
that you gave me the manuscript first.

42:37.137 --> 42:40.224
But I can't give you my blessings on it.

42:40.391 --> 42:43.852
Not before you show it to your mother.

42:44.019 --> 42:45.646
Oh, really?

42:46.313 --> 42:48.899
Kind of hoping I
wouldn't have to do that.

42:49.066 --> 42:52.861
Oh, darling. Sometimes, we
have to conquer our fears.

42:53.028 --> 42:54.655
Not just for our sake...

42:54.822 --> 42:57.866
but for the sake of your family.

42:58.284 --> 42:59.785
Hmm.

43:00.536 --> 43:02.705
- Okay.
- Mm-hm.

43:02.871 --> 43:04.957
You'll give it to her, then?

43:05.124 --> 43:07.209
Well, I could.

43:07.376 --> 43:12.423
But I think that this is something
that you need to do yourself.

43:14.341 --> 43:15.843
Okay.

44:01.722 --> 44:03.641
Next time on Chesapeake Shores:

44:03.807 --> 44:05.309
- You have termites.
- Termites?

44:05.476 --> 44:07.770
I need someone I can trust running this.

44:07.936 --> 44:11.398
- Chris has no idea about the Bridge.
- I got my start date for Philly.

44:11.565 --> 44:13.442
- So you're going?
- Ms. Marvel is me.

44:13.609 --> 44:15.903
I wanna make sure I'm
making the right decision.

44:16.070 --> 44:18.405
- My firm wants to hire you.
- Mom, something wrong?

44:18.572 --> 44:20.157
- I read your book.
- And...?

44:20.158 --> 44:23.115
