WEBVTT

00:15.167 --> 00:17.375
(birds singing)

00:17.459 --> 00:19.876
David Raccuglia:
I always loved Starved Rock.

00:19.959 --> 00:24.375
My father used to take me
hiking on the trails.

00:24.459 --> 00:28.542
It's called Starved Rock
from some sort of tribal war.

00:28.626 --> 00:32.834
One tribe surrounded the rock,
and the other tribe couldn't

00:32.918 --> 00:35.375
get down at the top
of the rock,

00:35.459 --> 00:37.626
and they starved them to death.

00:39.292 --> 00:42.918
(Interviewer speaking)

00:43.000 --> 00:47.167
I think everything
in the Illinois Valley
is possibly a myth.

00:49.209 --> 00:53.375
So, you know, you never know.

00:53.459 --> 00:56.209
Narrator:
And now, we visit
Starved Rock State Park

00:56.292 --> 00:59.709
on the south bank
of the Illinois River
in the south county.

00:59.792 --> 01:04.125
Visitors who fled the city
seeking peace and quiet
and beauty and comfort

01:04.209 --> 01:06.000
are richly rewarded
in this wonderland

01:06.083 --> 01:09.000
of strange
and beautiful sights.

01:11.167 --> 01:12.250
(intense music playing)

01:12.334 --> 01:14.459
David:
LaSalle is a sleepy
little town.

01:14.542 --> 01:16.667
This town was completely
not prepared.

01:16.751 --> 01:18.792
Things like this
just didn't happen.

01:21.542 --> 01:23.375
People didn't lock their doors.

01:23.459 --> 01:26.042
They weren't afraid
of violence.

01:26.125 --> 01:29.792
Narrator:
This is truly
a winter wonderland.

01:29.876 --> 01:35.792
But that was before three women
were murdered violently.

01:35.876 --> 01:37.667
Reporter 1:
March 16th was the date.

01:37.751 --> 01:39.584
The three Chicago women
had been found dead

01:39.667 --> 01:42.250
in a state park
90 miles from Chicago.

01:42.334 --> 01:44.000
Reporter 2:
Police say the women
were beaten to death,

01:44.083 --> 01:46.334
and their bodies dragged
into the cave about a mile

01:46.417 --> 01:48.167
from the main lodge
of the state park.

01:48.250 --> 01:51.292
Do you think that this,
uh, person could still
be here in this area?

01:51.375 --> 01:55.167
He could possibly be.
We're checking out, uh,
that, uh, possibility.

01:55.250 --> 01:57.834
Reporter 3:
His men have no
leads on anybody

01:57.918 --> 02:00.292
in this brutal triple slaying.

02:01.083 --> 02:02.792
(exhales deeply)

02:03.709 --> 02:06.167
In March of 1960,

02:06.250 --> 02:08.667
I was only seven months old,

02:08.751 --> 02:12.584
but the Starved Rock murders...
was with me

02:12.667 --> 02:16.375
from the first day
I could form a memory.

02:18.751 --> 02:21.876
LaSalle County,
it's about a hundred miles

02:21.959 --> 02:24.083
southwest of Chicago.

02:24.167 --> 02:26.751
It's a very isolated
little community,

02:26.834 --> 02:30.959
so when the murders happened,
it was mayhem.

02:31.042 --> 02:34.709
All of a sudden, people were
putting double and triple locks
on their doors

02:34.792 --> 02:38.334
out of their fear that
this madman was loose.

02:39.250 --> 02:42.500
But as shocked as the town was,

02:42.584 --> 02:44.667
they were even more shocked

02:44.751 --> 02:49.000
when a local man
was charged with the crime.

02:49.083 --> 02:51.584
Reporter 1:
Chester Weger was sentenced
to life in prison

02:51.667 --> 02:55.417
after being convicted
of murder back in 1961.

02:55.500 --> 02:59.125
As a kid, when I used to hear
the name Chester Weger,

02:59.209 --> 03:02.167
fear used to come into my body

03:02.250 --> 03:05.918
because my grandmother,
she had this massive scrapbook

03:06.000 --> 03:09.626
filled with newspaper
clippings, magazine articles

03:09.709 --> 03:13.834
from all over the world,
of Chester Weger.

03:13.918 --> 03:16.375
He looked like
the movie actor James Dean.

03:16.459 --> 03:18.250
He had incredibly cool hair,

03:18.334 --> 03:22.292
the epitome
of bad boy '50s youth.

03:24.959 --> 03:27.751
At the same time,
I used to lay in bed

03:27.834 --> 03:32.000
terrified that Chester Weger was
gonna climb through the window

03:32.083 --> 03:33.375
and kill me...

03:35.125 --> 03:38.959
because my father
was the prosecutor

03:39.042 --> 03:43.876
who put Chester Weger
in prison for life.

03:45.751 --> 03:49.417
Chester Weger
became my boogieman.

03:49.500 --> 03:51.083
Reporter 1:
At the age of 43,

03:51.167 --> 03:54.125
Weger has spent the bulk
of his adult life behind bars.

03:54.209 --> 03:57.918
Reporter 2:
Locked up 14 years before
the Sears Tower was built,

03:58.000 --> 04:01.083
Chester Weger, Illinois'
longest serving inmate.

04:01.167 --> 04:04.709
Reporter 3:
For 45 years, Weger
has insisted he's innocent.

04:04.792 --> 04:07.459
Reporter 4:
Each year, Weger goes
before the parole board

04:07.542 --> 04:08.918
hoping to be released.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.751
Reporter 5:
He still insists that
he had nothing to do

04:10.834 --> 04:13.375
with the murders
of the three women.

04:15.751 --> 04:17.834
David:
My grandmother,
she used to tell me,

04:17.918 --> 04:20.083
"If he ever gets out of jail,

04:20.167 --> 04:21.918
he's gonna come
and kill us all."

04:22.000 --> 04:24.626
Reporter 1:
New at ten, Chester Weger...
the infamous Starved Rock...

04:24.709 --> 04:27.542
The Starved Rock killer
is about to be freed.

04:34.709 --> 04:36.542
Announcer:
Limited time only at the Igloo.

04:36.626 --> 04:38.250
It's OMG good.

04:38.334 --> 04:39.959
Find it today at the Igloo.

04:40.042 --> 04:42.834
Carryout available,

04:42.918 --> 04:44.792
Announcer 2:
Rod and Jeremy
in the morning

04:44.876 --> 04:50.292
on Classic Hits 103.9,
WLPO, LaSalle.

04:51.542 --> 04:53.876
Rod (on radio):
It's 9:05, WLPO news is now,

04:53.959 --> 04:56.375
and I wanna take
your calls and texts.

04:56.459 --> 05:00.000
I'm thinking it through
on Chester Weger's, uh, case.

05:00.083 --> 05:02.876
Now, he is a convicted killer.
My opinion is that he did it.

05:02.959 --> 05:05.125
Uh, yours may be
different than mine.

05:05.209 --> 05:08.209
That's okay, you're respected
around here for your opinion.

05:08.292 --> 05:10.834
WLPO and it's Phyllis, uh,

05:10.918 --> 05:12.626
with the first comment
about this matter.

05:12.709 --> 05:15.375
-Good morning, Phyllis.
-(Phyllis on phone):

05:23.918 --> 05:26.334
Caller 2:
I knew his sisters,
I knew Chester.

05:26.417 --> 05:28.459
I'm sorry, he is guilty.

05:28.542 --> 05:30.876
Caller 3:
I think that he should
have a new trial.

05:30.959 --> 05:34.375
Uh, all these years it's always
been in question and that.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.500
- Yeah.
-Jeremy: Well...

05:36.584 --> 05:38.626
Rod:
Uh, pick up the phone
or turn the radio down, please.

05:38.709 --> 05:41.542
815-223-3093.

05:41.626 --> 05:43.209
Steve Stout:
Sixty years later,

05:43.292 --> 05:47.500
people are still scared
of going to Starved Rock.

05:47.584 --> 05:49.709
When I started writing
my book in the '80s,

05:49.792 --> 05:51.834
my friends from Chicago said,
"The reason we don't go

05:51.918 --> 05:54.959
to Starved Rock is because
you once had a murder there."

05:55.042 --> 05:58.918
I said, "The reason
I don't go to Chicago,
'cause once you had a fire."

05:59.000 --> 06:00.876
Bad things happen
in good places,

06:00.959 --> 06:02.751
and that's what
happened that day.

06:02.834 --> 06:05.292
Reporter 1:
Three women, close friends
and neighbors in Riverside,

06:05.375 --> 06:07.584
had gone to the park Monday
for a winter vacation.

06:07.667 --> 06:09.918
Their bodies were found
this morning about a mile

06:10.000 --> 06:11.834
from the main lodge
of the state park.

06:11.918 --> 06:15.334
The victims were 50-year-old
Mrs. Lillian Oetting,

06:15.417 --> 06:18.000
50-year-old
Mrs. Mildred Lindquist,

06:18.083 --> 06:21.209
and 47-year-old
Mrs. Frances Murphy.

06:21.292 --> 06:26.292
The three women left
a total of nine children.

06:28.584 --> 06:32.209
Kathy Etz:
I don't think we talked
a lot about my grandmother

06:32.292 --> 06:33.751
when I was a kid.

06:33.834 --> 06:36.042
I think it was just
extraordinarily painful,

06:36.125 --> 06:38.876
so I just didn't bring it up.

06:40.792 --> 06:44.292
I know from my aunts
and my mom, obviously,

06:44.375 --> 06:47.334
what made my grandmother
really special,

06:47.417 --> 06:48.918
but one of the real tragedies

06:49.000 --> 06:50.584
is people ask me,
"What was she like,"

06:50.667 --> 06:52.918
and I'm like, "I don't know
what she was like."

06:53.000 --> 06:57.292
I don't know what
made her special 'cause
I never got to meet her.

07:03.334 --> 07:06.876
I mean, the photo
that really kills me...

07:06.959 --> 07:09.000
it's, actually, this one.

07:09.083 --> 07:11.918
Here's my mom
so excited to get married,

07:12.000 --> 07:15.709
and just thinking that
nine months later her--

07:15.792 --> 07:17.459
she was gonna learn
this horrible thing,

07:17.542 --> 07:18.959
and her mom was gonna be gone.

07:19.042 --> 07:21.459
It-- I don't know.
When I look at this photo...

07:22.751 --> 07:24.792
it really upsets me.

07:36.584 --> 07:39.834
My grandmother was going away
with two women,

07:39.918 --> 07:44.042
uh, spend a few days
at Starved Rock hiking.

07:44.125 --> 07:47.125
Steve:
They parked their car
at the lodge,

07:47.209 --> 07:50.042
checked into their rooms.

07:50.125 --> 07:53.542
They left most of their
possessions in those rooms.

07:53.626 --> 07:57.334
They had lunch, decided
to take an afternoon walk.

07:57.417 --> 08:00.542
They left the lodge.

08:00.626 --> 08:03.000
They spent some time
taking pictures of themselves

08:03.083 --> 08:06.292
in front of the ice fall
in St. Louis Canyon.

08:09.667 --> 08:11.542
And they never returned.

08:11.626 --> 08:13.667
(phone ringing)

08:13.751 --> 08:16.834
Kathy:
One of the husbands
called the inn to say that

08:16.918 --> 08:18.042
he hadn't heard from his wife

08:18.125 --> 08:21.334
who was supposed
to have phoned him.

08:21.417 --> 08:24.626
Steve:
That night there was
a tremendous snowstorm here

08:24.709 --> 08:26.167
that really shut things down.

08:26.250 --> 08:27.709
(phone ringing)

08:27.792 --> 08:28.751
Wednesday, they called again,

08:28.834 --> 08:31.542
and they said,
"This is not right.

08:31.626 --> 08:34.792
They would've called by now.
What's goin' on down there?"

08:34.876 --> 08:37.584
So, they went into the rooms.

08:37.667 --> 08:39.250
Kathy:
The beds had not been slept in,

08:39.334 --> 08:43.083
the luggage was intact,
undisturbed.

08:43.167 --> 08:45.542
Steve:
They went out,
looked at their car,

08:45.626 --> 08:49.334
and it was covered with snow.
It hadn't moved.

08:50.125 --> 08:52.209
They knew at that moment

08:52.292 --> 08:56.292
they had three people missing
at Starved Rock State Park.

09:06.250 --> 09:09.083
Rod: Phil on the WLPO
River City Ways text line says,

09:09.167 --> 09:11.083
"Can you imagine
if he didn't do it?

09:11.167 --> 09:12.459
"There's a miscarriage
of justice

09:12.542 --> 09:14.083
that he spent
his whole life behind bars."

09:14.167 --> 09:15.959
Jeremy:
But you have to believe
in the justice system,

09:16.042 --> 09:18.959
especially when people
of, of such high character

09:19.042 --> 09:21.125
as the attorneys
who tried this case--

09:21.209 --> 09:23.918
David:
This murder that
happened in 1960

09:24.000 --> 09:27.334
has left this town
completely divided.

09:27.417 --> 09:31.959
It's like anything,
everybody has their opinion.

09:32.042 --> 09:35.083
It took me a long time,
it took me years,

09:35.167 --> 09:39.250
several years,
to find my footing with this.

09:39.334 --> 09:42.751
A man behind bars
in Illinois since 1960

09:42.834 --> 09:45.375
is looking to the governor
for clemency tonight.

09:45.459 --> 09:47.667
David:
In 2003, a good friend of mine

09:47.751 --> 09:51.292
sent me a newspaper clipping,

09:51.375 --> 09:55.125
and it said that there was
an appellate court defender

09:55.209 --> 09:58.334
who was opening
Chester Weger's case,

09:58.417 --> 10:00.125
trying to prove his innocence,

10:00.209 --> 10:01.834
and that he was
wrongfully convicted.

10:01.918 --> 10:03.334
Reporter 1:
His attorney, Donna Kelly,

10:03.417 --> 10:05.334
argued that her client
should be pardoned.

10:05.417 --> 10:10.000
For Chester "Rocky" Weger,
the pardon hearing may be
his last bid for freedom.

10:10.083 --> 10:15.626
She was accusing my father
of, of making inaccurate claims

10:15.709 --> 10:18.125
about Chester Weger's case,

10:18.209 --> 10:21.834
and, you know, it was funny
because that really hit me,

10:21.918 --> 10:24.167
and I realized that...

10:25.834 --> 10:27.834
I wonder if that was true.

10:29.250 --> 10:32.500
Growing up with this case,
my father was my hero,

10:32.584 --> 10:36.542
so reading this news article
with all these accusations,

10:36.626 --> 10:38.751
that made me very, very angry.

10:40.500 --> 10:43.918
My mother passed away
when I was nine years old.

10:44.000 --> 10:49.292
My father raised
my sister and I with the help
of my grandmother.

10:49.375 --> 10:53.000
I was treated very well
in LaSalle by a lot of people

10:53.083 --> 10:56.000
because Anthony Raccuglia,
my father,

10:56.083 --> 10:59.292
put away
the Starved Rock murderer.

10:59.375 --> 11:03.751
And, at the same time, I was
treated sometimes very poorly

11:03.834 --> 11:06.876
because many people
in this town believe

11:06.959 --> 11:10.417
that my father put away
an innocent man.

11:10.500 --> 11:15.751
I had friends that couldn't
come over to my house,

11:15.834 --> 11:19.250
and I used to get in fights,
like physical fights,

11:19.334 --> 11:24.584
over defending my father
for handling this case.

11:24.667 --> 11:26.959
I remember running
home to my father,

11:27.042 --> 11:28.334
and he hugged me and said,

11:28.417 --> 11:30.876
"I'm telling you, you have
nothing to worry about.

11:30.959 --> 11:34.542
Chester Weger was guilty.
I put a guilty man in prison."

11:34.626 --> 11:36.751
And that made me feel good,
you know,

11:36.834 --> 11:40.959
knowing that my father was
on the right side of the law.

11:41.042 --> 11:45.459
But could it be possible that
Chester Weger was innocent?

11:45.542 --> 11:47.834
There was something
to get to the bottom of.

11:47.918 --> 11:49.500
Crew Member:
All set. Sound speed.

11:49.584 --> 11:51.959
David:
That was the one
thing that sent me

11:52.042 --> 11:53.834
into forward motion
in making a film.

11:53.918 --> 11:57.292
I bet you love this, right?
I come to your office,
and disrupt your whole day?

11:57.375 --> 11:59.375
Well, it's the only time
I get to see you, though,

11:59.459 --> 12:01.584
is when you're--
want something, you know?

12:01.667 --> 12:05.542
-David: Well...
-At least that's an opportunity
for me to get to talk to ya.

12:05.626 --> 12:07.542
You know I have a lot
of questions.

12:07.626 --> 12:10.334
I've been calling you,
and talking to you about it.

12:10.417 --> 12:12.209
Anthony Raccuglia:
My question is,
why are you doing this?

12:12.292 --> 12:15.042
I know you were always
obsessed with this case.

12:15.125 --> 12:18.751
Do you remember how disturbed
you were that, maybe, he would
get out of prison,

12:18.834 --> 12:21.083
and come and harm the family
and harm you,

12:21.167 --> 12:24.292
and how you wanted to sleep
with me almost every night?

12:24.375 --> 12:26.417
You'd be waiting for me
when I came home?

12:26.500 --> 12:30.250
Isn't it a little bit ironic
that now you're doing

12:30.334 --> 12:34.500
a documentary as to whether
or not this man is innocent?

12:34.584 --> 12:37.375
There just isn't any doubt
that the man was guilty.

12:37.459 --> 12:40.000
It's just the story.
I wanted to tell the truth.

12:40.083 --> 12:41.709
I wanted to go all the way
back to the beginning,

12:41.792 --> 12:46.000
and exhaust all urban legend,
and try and just tell the story

12:46.083 --> 12:48.709
as it, as it really happened.

12:51.459 --> 12:52.876
I came back to LaSalle.

12:52.959 --> 12:54.751
-Crew Member 1: You rolling?
-Crew Member 2: Yeah.

12:54.834 --> 12:57.918
-David: Oh good. Shit.
-Crew Member 3: These people
think he's innocent.

12:58.000 --> 13:02.459
David:
And one of the first things
I did was get all of the data,

13:02.542 --> 13:04.626
all of the trial transcripts,

13:04.709 --> 13:07.292
everything from
the investigation that existed.

13:07.375 --> 13:09.000
-Crew Member 1:
Is that all right?
-Crew Member 2: Yeah.

13:09.083 --> 13:11.959
David:
I was able to get
a lot of people

13:12.042 --> 13:14.876
from the case
because of my father.

13:14.959 --> 13:18.042
The Starved Rock murder
gave him some fame.

13:18.125 --> 13:19.709
And my grandfather spent

13:19.792 --> 13:22.792
45 years as an alderman.

13:22.876 --> 13:26.209
So, I interviewed
several prosecutors.

13:26.292 --> 13:30.292
Oh yeah, you don't
have to be too smart,
you just use common sense.

13:30.375 --> 13:32.083
That'll solve a lot
of questions.

13:32.167 --> 13:33.751
David:
Journalists of the day.

13:33.834 --> 13:35.667
(dogs howling, barking)

13:35.751 --> 13:39.417
And I wanted to go
to where real information was,

13:39.500 --> 13:41.000
and that was on the street.

13:41.083 --> 13:45.042
(country music playing)

13:45.125 --> 13:49.250
There was a big festival
called the Burgoo Festival.

13:49.334 --> 13:53.292
There's hundreds
and hundreds of people.

13:53.375 --> 13:57.209
We just put it out there
that we were gonna be in town,

13:57.292 --> 14:01.042
and we had lines of people
wanting to talk to us.

14:01.125 --> 14:04.751
Person:
If Weger did it,
I must've been his accomplice.

14:04.834 --> 14:10.000
There's no way that one man
could have contained them women.

14:10.083 --> 14:12.334
David:
The people who believed
in his innocence

14:12.417 --> 14:13.626
were very passionate.

14:13.709 --> 14:16.667
I don't care what anybody says,
I'll never believe it.

14:16.751 --> 14:18.542
Sensible? Not always.

14:18.626 --> 14:19.876
(Interviewer speaking)

14:19.959 --> 14:21.751
The man is innocent as can be,

14:21.834 --> 14:25.876
and, uh, and I'll go
to my grave believin' that.

14:25.959 --> 14:27.918
He wasn't bigger than a fly.
How in the hell--

14:28.000 --> 14:32.584
You ever get three women
that's mad, and try
to tie 'em all three up?

14:32.667 --> 14:35.375
David:
The other 50% of the people

14:35.459 --> 14:38.542
couldn't have believed
in his guilt more.

14:38.626 --> 14:41.209
-Yeah, I think he's very guilty.
-Guilty.

14:41.292 --> 14:43.292
Sometimes people's nature
is just evil.

14:43.375 --> 14:45.584
David:
The community
is incredibly passionate.

14:45.667 --> 14:47.751
It's almost political.

14:47.834 --> 14:50.000
I don't think a country boy
can do something like that.

14:50.083 --> 14:52.584
David:
I talked to anybody
that would give me a story

14:52.667 --> 14:53.918
about Chester Weger.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.792
Person:
I do think Steve Stout's book

14:55.876 --> 14:58.375
is the primary reason today

14:58.459 --> 15:01.125
people are convinced
Chester's guilty.

15:04.626 --> 15:06.542
David:
Growing up in this area,
when you hear the words

15:06.626 --> 15:08.083
"Starved Rock," you think
of Steve Stout.

15:08.167 --> 15:10.250
-I, personally--
-Well, that's nice to say.

15:10.334 --> 15:11.709
David:
Well, in my father's home,

15:11.792 --> 15:14.459
there's a photograph that
you did of the canyon, framed--

15:14.542 --> 15:16.542
I love the park,
and I'm very proud

15:16.626 --> 15:20.292
to have people
think about the park,
and link me with it.

15:20.375 --> 15:22.125
I respect the park.
I call it "my park."

15:22.209 --> 15:24.918
I would never hurt my park.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.250
It's just an amazing place.

15:26.334 --> 15:28.167
That's what attracted
the three women

15:28.250 --> 15:30.000
into St. Louis Canyon that day.

15:30.083 --> 15:31.876
You know, Starved Rock
is named from violence,

15:31.959 --> 15:34.876
and that day it, it really
lived up to its name.

15:34.959 --> 15:39.459
Bill Danley, a reporter at the
LaSalle Daily News Tribune,

15:39.542 --> 15:42.083
he was there at the time
the bodies were discovered.

15:42.167 --> 15:44.334
David:
We have six minutes
of tape on this tape,

15:44.417 --> 15:45.626
and we have to change.

15:45.709 --> 15:48.167
Either way, I'd like you
to tell the story.

15:48.250 --> 15:50.292
I was 29 years old at the time,

15:50.375 --> 15:52.417
and about, uh, eight years into

15:52.500 --> 15:54.626
a 15-year newspaper career.

15:54.709 --> 15:57.626
On that morning, sometime early,
we'd got a, a report

15:57.709 --> 16:01.083
that three women were missing
at Starved Rock Lodge
at the park.

16:01.167 --> 16:04.042
We drove down to the mouth
of the St. Louis Canyon

16:04.125 --> 16:05.709
and started walking in.

16:05.792 --> 16:08.709
And you come around
into what is the bulb
of that canyon,

16:08.792 --> 16:12.375
and right in front of you
in the wintertime is a truly
majestic frozen waterfall.

16:12.459 --> 16:18.042
Like a giant pipe organ,
you know, in an ice land
of some kind...

16:18.125 --> 16:22.500
and the fresh snow,
and it looked just so pristine,
like a calendar picture.

16:22.584 --> 16:24.751
And then, you turn,
and right here,

16:24.834 --> 16:26.876
you know, is the carnage.

16:29.709 --> 16:33.000
Eye-level in front
of us were the bodies
of those three women.

16:34.250 --> 16:36.667
Nobody was expecting that,
and I'm telling you,

16:36.751 --> 16:39.542
it hit 'em like with the force
of a physical blow.

16:41.626 --> 16:44.792
And I think the thing
that, that made it seem
so profane was the fact

16:44.876 --> 16:47.751
they, they weren't lying
where they had fallen...

16:47.834 --> 16:49.918
not willy-nilly,
they had been put on display

16:50.000 --> 16:54.459
with their legs spreadeagled,
their underclothes torn away.

16:57.083 --> 16:59.918
Philosophically,
I thought I was opposed
to the death penalty,

17:00.000 --> 17:03.876
and I'm here to tell ya
on that day, in that canyon,

17:03.959 --> 17:08.542
I crossed that barrier
because I looked at that scene,

17:08.626 --> 17:11.167
I thought, if the man,
the person who did this,

17:11.250 --> 17:13.417
and could be brought to justice,
and the only way

17:13.500 --> 17:16.792
he could get what he
had comin' to him was
for me to throw the switch,

17:16.876 --> 17:18.459
I would do it in a heartbeat.

17:18.542 --> 17:22.083
And I guess I haven't changed
my mind all these years
on that subject.

17:23.500 --> 17:26.334
These women were not
just murdered,

17:26.417 --> 17:29.250
they were brutally beaten,

17:29.334 --> 17:31.876
almost to the point
of decapitation.

17:31.959 --> 17:37.626
Eyewitnesses of this,
they were never able
to get it out of their minds.

17:37.709 --> 17:40.292
Bill:
You just kinda grit your teeth,
and you take the pictures,

17:40.375 --> 17:42.626
and you'd write the stories
and you do the thing, but...

17:42.709 --> 17:45.626
you still go home,
and dream at night, you know?

17:47.000 --> 17:49.459
So, that was where
the investigation got underway,

17:49.542 --> 17:53.334
and, immediately, the decision
was made the state police
would take charge.

17:53.417 --> 17:57.083
Anthony:
There was a competitive edge
to this investigation.

17:57.167 --> 17:59.918
The state police,
the sheriff's office,

18:00.000 --> 18:03.709
and Harland Warren trying
each to solve this crime.

18:09.751 --> 18:14.584
Harland Warren:
I, uh, had no education
in solving criminal cases.

18:14.667 --> 18:18.083
But... you gotta
have common sense,

18:18.167 --> 18:19.834
and the only reason
I had common sense was

18:19.918 --> 18:23.292
because I was born and raised
on a farm in Serena Township.

18:23.375 --> 18:28.459
I've never met anyone
that reeks of another era
more than Harland Warren.

18:28.542 --> 18:29.876
(laughs)

18:29.959 --> 18:32.626
He has that conservative,

18:32.709 --> 18:35.626
1960 kind of style about him.

18:35.709 --> 18:39.375
When he starts tellin' the case,
he closes his eyes, and--

18:39.459 --> 18:43.042
See, uh, about 12:30

18:43.125 --> 18:47.167
on a, a Wednesday,
the 16th of March,

18:47.250 --> 18:48.500
I was at the club.

18:48.584 --> 18:51.083
I had my lunch,
and I was playin' gin rummy.

18:51.167 --> 18:54.125
I mean, who plays gin rummy
at a club at lunch?

18:54.209 --> 18:57.000
He had an edge about him.

18:57.083 --> 19:01.542
A deputy called me that they'd
found the bodies of three ladies
that were missing,

19:01.626 --> 19:05.834
and they'd pick me up,
and take me out
to the St. Louis Canyon.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.667
State police were
already there,

19:09.751 --> 19:11.959
and gathering up the evidence
and everything.

19:12.042 --> 19:13.834
Bill:
They came in with
like flame throwers,

19:13.918 --> 19:16.209
and they started
melting the snow...

19:16.292 --> 19:18.918
and they were
gathering little bits
and pieces of evidence.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.626
And when I was standin' there,
I stepped on something hard.

19:22.709 --> 19:26.792
So, I leaned down,
brushed some snow away,

19:26.876 --> 19:28.959
and here was a tree branch.

19:29.042 --> 19:32.292
I produced the club
as a possible murder weapon,

19:32.375 --> 19:36.375
and the autopsies found bits
of wood taken from the faces

19:36.459 --> 19:37.709
of the three ladies.

19:37.792 --> 19:39.876
Reporter 1:
They did recover
the murder weapon,

19:39.959 --> 19:42.417
a tree limb that was used
to savagely beat the women.

19:42.500 --> 19:47.626
Harland:
And there was also broken
binoculars and the, uh, camera.

19:47.709 --> 19:49.918
Bill:
The murderer had attacked them
with that camera.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.375
That was, uh, another
murder weapon.

19:51.459 --> 19:53.292
They didn't seem to leave
much doubt about that.

19:53.375 --> 19:54.542
Reporter 1:
Then there was the twine used

19:54.626 --> 19:56.542
by the killer to tie
up his victims.

19:56.626 --> 19:58.250
Steve:
Tied up, disrobed,

19:58.334 --> 20:01.417
like it was a rape.
A rapist did this crime.

20:01.500 --> 20:04.500
Reporter 2:
You will be looking for a sex
criminal of some type,

20:04.584 --> 20:07.042
- I would imagine?
-That's right, I think
he would have to be.

20:07.125 --> 20:09.167
John Drummond:
Authorities also found several
pictures had been taken

20:09.250 --> 20:12.417
by the victims apparently
minutes before the murder.

20:12.500 --> 20:14.709
One photo gave an initial
impression of a stranger

20:14.792 --> 20:18.000
lurking in the background,
perhaps the killer.

20:18.083 --> 20:21.334
Ray Eutsey:
We found what we think
is a, is a picture of a man,

20:21.417 --> 20:22.918
possibly the assailant,

20:23.000 --> 20:26.667
and, uh, we think
we have valuable evidence.

20:26.751 --> 20:29.459
John:
There was still plenty
of police work to be done.

20:29.542 --> 20:34.250
From LaSalle County,
John Drummond, CBS2 News.

20:42.542 --> 20:44.083
My name is John Drummond.

20:44.167 --> 20:46.250
That's spelling D like in David,
R as in Robert,

20:46.334 --> 20:48.626
U-M-M-O-N-D.

20:48.709 --> 20:50.709
I'm a former reporter
at Channel 2

20:50.792 --> 20:53.459
in Chicago, Illinois,
WBBM television.

20:53.542 --> 20:55.834
Well, there are those
who call me "Bulldog."

20:55.918 --> 20:58.250
I had bulldog perseverance,
and so on.

20:58.334 --> 21:01.209
That's how I got the name.

21:01.292 --> 21:03.959
In March of 1960,
there was a major, major story.

21:04.042 --> 21:08.334
One of the so-called
crimes of the century.

21:08.417 --> 21:10.000
Murders didn't happen
down there,

21:10.083 --> 21:12.667
and the three women that were
slain from suburban Chicago

21:12.751 --> 21:15.959
were all prominent,
and they were inundated
by media.

21:16.042 --> 21:19.209
Life magazine sent a crew
down there to cover that story.

21:19.292 --> 21:21.209
The Chicago Tribune
stayed at the lodge

21:21.292 --> 21:24.500
trying to get updates every day
on what was going on.

21:24.584 --> 21:26.375
Who was the killer or killers,
whoever it was?

21:26.459 --> 21:29.584
Why were they slain?
Were they assaulted sexually?
Were they robbed?

21:29.667 --> 21:31.876
These were the questions
that people are asking about.

21:31.959 --> 21:33.667
Reporter 1:
At the main lodge,
we talked to

21:33.751 --> 21:35.250
LaSalle County Sheriff
Ray Eutsey.

21:35.334 --> 21:38.584
Do you think this could've
been done, Sheriff, by one man?

21:38.667 --> 21:41.125
I suppose one man
could have done it.

21:41.209 --> 21:43.125
Reporter 1:
Do you think there could
be more than one man

21:43.209 --> 21:44.542
involved in this crime?

21:44.626 --> 21:46.083
That's a, that's a possibility.

21:46.167 --> 21:49.125
David:
I really wanted to know
who they were thinking of.

21:49.209 --> 21:51.459
Why, what was the motive,

21:51.542 --> 21:53.417
everything I could
pull together,

21:53.500 --> 21:55.417
starting with
the investigation.

21:55.500 --> 21:57.292
Harland:
The three, uh, ladies

21:57.375 --> 21:59.042
had been down by the waterfall,

21:59.125 --> 22:02.667
and we had the photograph
of Mrs. Oetting and Mrs. Murphy

22:02.751 --> 22:04.667
standing in the snow.

22:04.751 --> 22:07.500
We figured out that it
was the Billy Goat Trail.

22:07.584 --> 22:10.959
So, at least we knew
which trail they took

22:11.042 --> 22:13.500
to go down to St. Louis Canyon.

22:13.584 --> 22:17.167
Well, the Billy Goat Trail
came from the lodge.

22:17.250 --> 22:21.250
Steve:
The police believed the killer
might have saw the women

22:21.334 --> 22:24.751
leave the lodge,
and took a hike into the woods

22:24.834 --> 22:27.083
right on their path.

22:27.167 --> 22:30.167
Anthony:
The rumor mill
was heavy from day one

22:30.250 --> 22:33.417
about lodge employees
being questioned.

22:33.500 --> 22:38.792
There were people that thought
that maybe it was the Spiros
family that was involved.

22:38.876 --> 22:43.000
David:
You know, Nick Spiros was
the Starved Rock Lodge owner.

22:43.083 --> 22:46.250
He was concerned that it was
going to affect his business.

22:46.334 --> 22:47.834
John:
And people said,
"I'm not goin' down there

22:47.918 --> 22:51.250
to Starved Rock anymore.
No, no way, no way."

22:51.334 --> 22:54.167
Bill:
The husbands put up
a reward of $30,000,

22:54.250 --> 22:57.584
and then, Nick Spiros
at the lodge added five grand.

22:57.667 --> 22:59.542
David:
He was trying to turn
some of this into a bit

22:59.626 --> 23:01.959
of marketing, rewards.

23:02.042 --> 23:04.209
"I'll take the first polygraph."

23:04.292 --> 23:07.667
Bill:
The state police sent a couple
of lie detector operators

23:07.751 --> 23:11.125
to run all the lodge employees
through lie detector tests.

23:11.209 --> 23:15.292
David:
So, George Spiros was
the son of Nick Spiros.

23:15.375 --> 23:17.125
He was someone who was suspect.

23:17.209 --> 23:19.584
He was given a polygraph test.

23:19.667 --> 23:21.709
He, basically,
said he had an alibi,

23:21.792 --> 23:25.500
but he did say that he
saw employees of the lodge

23:25.584 --> 23:26.751
with the women.

23:26.834 --> 23:29.334
They looked
at the male employees,

23:29.417 --> 23:31.083
people that had
criminal records,

23:31.167 --> 23:33.000
anyone who looked suspicious.

23:33.083 --> 23:36.459
Steve:
Chester Weger and a friend
of his, Stanley Tucker,

23:36.542 --> 23:39.292
who worked in the kitchen,
so, of course,
they were suspects,

23:39.375 --> 23:42.959
like almost everybody
at the lodge was a suspect
at the time.

23:43.042 --> 23:46.417
Almost everybody in Illi--
Illinois Valley was a suspect.

23:46.500 --> 23:49.334
David:
People were interested
in that reward.

23:49.417 --> 23:51.876
Letters were pouring in,

23:51.959 --> 23:54.292
they were following up
on everything.

23:54.375 --> 23:56.459
Harland:
The state police figured
it was the Mafia,

23:56.542 --> 23:59.167
but the Mafia didn't have
a damn thing to do with that.

23:59.250 --> 24:00.125
(chuckles)

24:00.209 --> 24:01.918
David:
There was an asylum escapee.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.626
That's where the madman
that was on the loose came out.

24:04.709 --> 24:07.500
You know, all of these leads
ended up nowhere.

24:07.584 --> 24:09.292
Bill:
When I looked at that scene,
I had no doubt

24:09.375 --> 24:10.417
it was a sex crime.

24:10.500 --> 24:11.792
Thing is, when they
examined the bodies,

24:11.876 --> 24:13.626
they didn't find any sperm.

24:13.709 --> 24:16.083
That was a puzzle.
They couldn't figure it out what
the hell was taking place there.

24:16.167 --> 24:17.459
They couldn't figure it out.

24:17.542 --> 24:19.834
Spring came and went,
summer started,

24:19.918 --> 24:22.959
and the investigation
seemed to just bog down.

24:23.042 --> 24:25.042
Reporter 1:
The authorities had
few clues to go on.

24:25.125 --> 24:27.709
Person:
They could see some man
in the background,

24:27.792 --> 24:29.834
but never turned out that way.

24:29.918 --> 24:32.125
Reporter 1:
Apparently, Mrs. Oetting
had failed to wind

24:32.209 --> 24:33.542
the camera completely,

24:33.626 --> 24:35.417
resulting in a double exposure.

24:35.500 --> 24:37.918
The photos were of no help
in finding the killer.

24:40.959 --> 24:43.334
Steve:
For eight months
the crime went unsolved.

24:43.417 --> 24:45.667
People were so scared.

24:45.751 --> 24:48.751
People wouldn't go
to the park, the lodge.

24:48.834 --> 24:50.667
They pulled their kids
in at night.

24:50.751 --> 24:53.918
Everybody was scared to death.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
Who could've killed
these three women?

24:58.751 --> 25:00.542
-David: Are you rolling yet?
-Crew Member: Yeah.

25:00.626 --> 25:03.417
You know what,
what I opened my book to?

25:03.500 --> 25:05.792
Habeas corpus.
Ya ever hear of habeas corpus?

25:05.876 --> 25:08.375
David:
I have. What is, what is,
actually, habeas corpus?

25:08.459 --> 25:12.250
Harland:
It means, whatever you're
looking for, you found it.

25:12.334 --> 25:14.083
David:
Just look in the book
a little bit

25:14.167 --> 25:15.542
like you're reading, Harland,

25:15.626 --> 25:17.459
for a few--
just for a couple minutes here.

25:17.542 --> 25:18.959
Sure.

25:19.042 --> 25:22.709
Harland:
Time went on,
but we didn't have a suspect.

25:22.792 --> 25:24.709
And The Chicago Tribune

25:24.792 --> 25:27.584
blamed me for bungling
the evidence.

25:27.667 --> 25:30.626
I thought, "Well, hell,
as long as I'm the goat,

25:30.709 --> 25:33.709
"uh, maybe, I better
look into this thing,

25:33.792 --> 25:36.125
see if I can find anything."

25:36.209 --> 25:38.542
So, I went
to the sheriff, Eutsey,

25:38.626 --> 25:42.334
and I said, "I would like
to have you assign Wayne Hess

25:42.417 --> 25:45.292
"and Bill Dummett
to me exclusively.

25:45.375 --> 25:49.000
No publicity or anything,
just let us go."

25:49.083 --> 25:53.709
Hess was a gentleman,
a police farmer, a great guy.

25:53.792 --> 25:56.334
Dummett was a different
type of person,

25:56.417 --> 25:59.417
but he was just
a hard-nosed policeman,

25:59.500 --> 26:01.042
and that's 1960,

26:01.125 --> 26:03.959
and they were the classic
good cop, bad cop.

26:04.042 --> 26:06.125
Made a good team, I thought.

26:19.292 --> 26:22.042
"...is the evidence gathered
at the scene of the crime."

26:22.125 --> 26:27.751
I'd sit by the hour
in my private office
with all the evidence,

26:27.834 --> 26:31.959
and I thought, "Well, what is
there here that's a solution?"

26:32.042 --> 26:33.834
So, kind of, absentmindedly

26:33.918 --> 26:36.083
I picked up some
of the knotted cord

26:36.167 --> 26:40.375
that was removed
from the wrists
of the three ladies...

26:40.459 --> 26:44.000
and I started counting
the number of strands,

26:44.083 --> 26:47.417
and it came out to 32.

26:47.500 --> 26:50.375
I called Mr. Spiros,
and I said,

26:50.459 --> 26:53.417
"Maybe this string
came from the lodge."

26:53.500 --> 26:58.751
So, I went to the lodge
at night when there'd
be no one around.

26:58.834 --> 27:01.626
Finally, I got out
to the kitchen,

27:01.709 --> 27:06.667
and here was a butcher block
with a cone of cord.

27:06.751 --> 27:12.042
And here on a coat hanger
was a ball of cord.

27:12.125 --> 27:13.959
I snipped off a piece,

27:14.042 --> 27:18.375
went back to my office
in the middle of the night,

27:18.459 --> 27:20.459
and I start counting.

27:20.542 --> 27:26.417
The cone of cord is 20,
and the ball of cord is 12.

27:26.500 --> 27:29.792
Well, and I start
loosening the knot.

27:29.876 --> 27:32.792
It turns out
there were two strings.

27:32.876 --> 27:36.500
What's 12 plus 20? 32.

27:38.042 --> 27:40.334
So, I got in touch
with John Reid,

27:40.417 --> 27:43.209
polygraph people,
internationally known.

27:43.292 --> 27:46.792
And they sent down
Steve Kindig,
one of his operators.

27:46.876 --> 27:52.292
Steve set up his polygraph
in the two-room cabin,

27:52.375 --> 27:56.417
and Dummett and Hess started
bringing in the employees.

28:00.167 --> 28:02.250
One of the individuals
brought in

28:02.334 --> 28:05.250
identified himself
as Chester Weger.

28:05.334 --> 28:08.125
Chester Weger's
a dish washer in the kitchen.

28:08.209 --> 28:11.542
"Chester, do you carry
string like this?"
"Well, yes, I do."

28:11.626 --> 28:13.584
"I'd make little cats
in the cradle,

28:13.667 --> 28:16.542
set snares and traps
for animals in the park."

28:16.626 --> 28:20.876
Harland:
Usually, Steve only spent
about 15 minutes with people.

28:20.959 --> 28:22.209
Half an hour went by,

28:22.292 --> 28:24.167
three quarters
of an hour went by.

28:24.250 --> 28:27.709
In about an hour,
Steve came out.

28:27.792 --> 28:31.125
His face white as a bedsheet.

28:31.209 --> 28:33.751
He says, "He's the one."

28:33.834 --> 28:37.125
He says, "I'm 100% sure."

28:40.292 --> 28:42.709
Now we had our suspect.

28:45.042 --> 28:46.792
David:
So, here it is right here.

28:46.876 --> 28:51.334
This is where Chester Weger's
family home was.

28:51.417 --> 28:55.083
They were big coon hunters.

28:55.167 --> 28:59.042
I'm sure this is
coon hunting heaven right here.

28:59.125 --> 29:02.751
You do realize we may get--
Somebody'll call the police.

29:02.834 --> 29:05.083
-Crew Member: Yeah.
-And I'm not kidding you.

29:05.167 --> 29:06.417
-Crew Member: Yeah.
-I know that--

29:06.500 --> 29:08.918
So, in the making of this film,
my whole goal,

29:09.000 --> 29:12.709
I, I, I don't know if this is
cathartic or what the reason is,

29:12.792 --> 29:15.375
I just wanted to talk
to Chester Weger in person.

29:15.459 --> 29:19.209
I needed to sit across
from him and talk to him.

29:19.292 --> 29:21.000
That was very important to me.

29:21.083 --> 29:22.751
I wanted to figure out

29:22.834 --> 29:25.209
Chester Weger as a man,
what is he like

29:25.292 --> 29:28.834
because he scared the shit
out of me most of my life.

29:28.918 --> 29:31.000
So, I wrote Chester a letter.

29:31.083 --> 29:32.834
He never responded.

29:32.918 --> 29:35.876
I wrote him a second letter,
he never responded.

29:35.959 --> 29:40.000
Of course, having the last name
Raccuglia didn't help,

29:40.083 --> 29:43.459
so I started collecting
and gathering all these stories

29:43.542 --> 29:45.375
about him as a person.

29:45.459 --> 29:48.000
You know, there's a lot
of stories, believe me.

29:48.083 --> 29:52.083
My aunt Theresa,
my father's sister,

29:52.167 --> 29:53.709
went to school with Chester.

29:53.792 --> 29:57.375
She had a lot to say
about Chester Weger.

29:57.459 --> 29:59.000
Person:
That's right. Okay.

29:59.083 --> 30:03.083
We're all here tonight
to work on our class reunion.

30:03.167 --> 30:09.042
Chester Weger was a member
of our class for two years.

30:09.125 --> 30:11.417
Theresa Raccuglia Ellerbrock:
He never really talked much.

30:11.500 --> 30:13.959
What I remember of him
is the fact

30:14.042 --> 30:15.959
that we would walk out
the front door of LP,

30:16.042 --> 30:17.751
and he'd be in the tree
eating his lunch,

30:17.834 --> 30:19.167
and he, he'd make sounds at us.

30:19.250 --> 30:23.042
We'd hear this "whoooo" sound
coming from a tree.

30:23.125 --> 30:25.667
Well, it was him, he was up
in the tree eating his lunch.

30:25.751 --> 30:29.000
He was creepy, reclusive, loner.

30:29.083 --> 30:31.834
He had trouble with his wife
when he was married
with two kids.

30:31.918 --> 30:35.500
-Oh my god.
-I didn't even know he had kids.
-There were a lot of stories--

30:35.584 --> 30:38.959
There were a lot of stories
that came out that way that I,

30:39.042 --> 30:42.751
that I was told that I'm not
going to repeat at this point,

30:42.834 --> 30:44.959
but, um, yeah.

30:45.042 --> 30:50.375
So, I, uh, you know,
whatever ya think, ya think.

30:54.334 --> 30:56.375
We, we heard that,
we believed it.

30:56.459 --> 31:00.459
So, it may be that, uh, Chester
had a problem of some kind.

31:00.542 --> 31:03.250
There was always rumors
to that effect.

31:03.334 --> 31:06.375
David:
I've heard Chester
had a criminal past,

31:06.459 --> 31:08.709
the rape, when he
was 12 years old.

31:08.792 --> 31:11.542
-Juvenile. Juvenile records.
-Juvenile records.

31:11.626 --> 31:15.209
I think that's another, uh,
nail in his coffin, so to speak,

31:15.292 --> 31:18.500
that proves to you that
he was entirely capable.

31:18.584 --> 31:21.459
I have no doubts in my mind,
you know, that Chester

31:21.542 --> 31:23.459
assaulted the victims
who were killed here.

31:23.542 --> 31:27.083
They didn't find any sperm,
but, maybe, he was shooting
blanks or something.

31:27.167 --> 31:28.834
I don't know the answer.

31:28.918 --> 31:32.334
Anthony:
I think he had a propensity
to do these kinds of things,

31:32.417 --> 31:38.667
and this, of course,
was the major reason why
this case was finally solved.

31:38.751 --> 31:43.626
David:
In 1959, seven months
before the actual murders,

31:43.709 --> 31:46.918
there was another rape that
happened in Matthiessen Park,

31:47.000 --> 31:49.918
which is a park
right next to Starved Rock,

31:50.000 --> 31:53.125
very close to the Weger home
as well.

31:53.209 --> 31:56.375
Nothing came of it for months.

31:56.459 --> 31:58.250
Anthony:
There was a letter
that we saw that came

31:58.334 --> 32:02.000
from a teacher
by the name of Sue Ocepeck.

32:02.083 --> 32:04.417
She, actually, in my opinion,

32:04.500 --> 32:07.834
is the unsung hero
of this whole thing.

32:13.459 --> 32:15.334
From September 'til March.

32:15.417 --> 32:18.000
Sue Ocepeck:
45 years ago,

32:18.083 --> 32:20.000
a student of mine

32:20.083 --> 32:22.125
in my first year of teaching,

32:22.209 --> 32:23.626
um, told me

32:23.709 --> 32:27.626
about having been raped
in Matthiessen State Park.

32:29.667 --> 32:31.959
She was a teenager.

32:32.042 --> 32:36.667
Her and her boyfriend,
they were on this path,

32:36.751 --> 32:44.500
and this guy came out,
he had a rifle.

32:44.584 --> 32:49.792
He told her to tie
her boyfriend's hands.

32:49.876 --> 32:53.417
And she figured when he got
the wallet, you know, then,

32:53.500 --> 32:55.417
then he'd let 'em go.

32:55.500 --> 32:57.751
But he didn't.

32:57.834 --> 33:03.667
And she said she'll
never forget his face
as long as she lives.

33:03.751 --> 33:07.167
All the time that
he was raping her,

33:07.250 --> 33:10.167
he rolled a bullet in his mouth.

33:16.292 --> 33:21.834
Deputy sheriffs who had talked
to them did not believe
their story,

33:21.918 --> 33:25.042
and I couldn't understand,
why wouldn't they believe
the story, you know?

33:25.125 --> 33:28.834
I later found out
that those officers

33:28.918 --> 33:31.500
were Dummett and Hess.

33:31.584 --> 33:36.083
The next thing that happens,
one of those moments
that you remember forever,

33:36.167 --> 33:40.459
I was standing there ironing,
and I had the radio on.

33:40.542 --> 33:42.792
Reporter 1:
Early in the afternoon,
about 1 PM,

33:42.876 --> 33:45.375
they got a tip that
three Chicago women
had been found dead.

33:45.459 --> 33:47.209
Reporter 2:
Their bodies were found
this morning in a cave

33:47.292 --> 33:48.876
in Starved Rock State Park.

33:48.959 --> 33:51.542
At least two of the women
apparently had been raped.

33:51.626 --> 33:54.542
I was just covered with chills,
and, and I, actually, just felt

33:54.626 --> 33:58.334
like a bolt down my back.

33:58.417 --> 34:03.000
Now he did it, you know, this--
Maybe it's the same person.

34:04.792 --> 34:08.125
We both just hugged
each other and cried

34:08.209 --> 34:11.792
'cause we just kinda knew,
she thought so right away, too.

34:11.876 --> 34:15.459
She told me that the rapist

34:15.542 --> 34:20.250
had used twine
to wrap their wrists.

34:20.334 --> 34:22.292
I said, "I just have
to write a letter.

34:22.375 --> 34:25.709
"I have to tell them it might
have been the same person

34:25.792 --> 34:29.500
who then was still free
to commit murder."

34:31.000 --> 34:32.667
Dummett:
Well, then after this,

34:32.751 --> 34:34.584
I took a whole bunch of photos.

34:34.667 --> 34:36.584
I went to this gal's house,

34:36.667 --> 34:38.500
and, all of a sudden, she said

34:38.584 --> 34:40.375
that Chester raped her.

34:40.459 --> 34:43.918
She had busted out crying
and yelling and screaming

34:44.000 --> 34:45.792
and everything else.

34:45.876 --> 34:51.292
David:
And so Dummett and Hess
brought Chester to a lineup.

34:51.375 --> 34:52.667
And James Supan,

34:52.751 --> 34:55.918
who was the boyfriend
of the rape victim,

34:56.000 --> 34:57.542
also identified Chester

34:57.626 --> 35:02.751
as the person who
raped and robbed
that day in the park.

35:02.834 --> 35:06.375
So, Chester was brought back
into the interrogation room,

35:06.459 --> 35:09.209
and confronted
with three crimes.

35:09.292 --> 35:11.876
They said,
"Now we have you on these two,

35:11.959 --> 35:15.584
you might as well admit
to the Starved Rock murders."

35:15.667 --> 35:18.792
Steve:
He was faced with jail time
for the rape, robbery.

35:18.876 --> 35:22.125
He knew he was going to jail.

35:22.209 --> 35:23.792
He was caught.

35:31.459 --> 35:35.542
Steve:
And when his mom said,
"Son, tell the truth,"

35:35.626 --> 35:37.876
she walked out of the room
and that's when he did it.

35:37.959 --> 35:39.542
(David speaking)

35:39.626 --> 35:41.125
Sounds like an old Cagney movie,

35:41.209 --> 35:43.375
but that doesn't disprove
it didn't happen.

35:43.459 --> 35:45.209
Harland:
Around midnight,

35:45.292 --> 35:49.459
finally, Chester broke down
and confessed.

35:49.542 --> 35:52.959
Reporter 1:
23-year-old dish washer
Chester Otto Weger

35:53.042 --> 35:57.167
has confessed that he killed
three prominent Riverside women

35:57.250 --> 35:59.334
last March
in Starved Rock State Park,

35:59.417 --> 36:02.334
one of the most brutal crimes
solved suddenly

36:02.417 --> 36:04.918
after eight long months
of investigation.

36:05.000 --> 36:08.167
The confessed killer claims
that his mind was on robbery,

36:08.250 --> 36:10.792
not murder last March.

36:13.876 --> 36:16.959
-Bill: Chester Weger.
-Director: Go ahead, Bill.

36:17.042 --> 36:19.417
Chester Weger, well,
he got an itch

36:19.500 --> 36:22.250
Killed three women
with a white oak switch

36:22.334 --> 36:25.125
Yes, Chester Weger,
hound of hell

36:25.209 --> 36:27.125
Played it cool,
he did not tell

36:27.209 --> 36:29.417
Until his mother shed a tear

36:29.500 --> 36:31.167
Told him,
tell the truth, my dear

36:31.250 --> 36:33.334
Then Chester bowed
his head in pain

36:33.417 --> 36:36.500
Gulped and said,
I done it, Wayne

36:40.918 --> 36:43.334
(laughs)
Gonna start over.

36:43.417 --> 36:45.918
Forgot the lines.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.876
(murmuring lines)

36:48.959 --> 36:52.167
Steve:
Chester Weger wakes up
in the morning

36:52.250 --> 36:53.876
after his confession,

36:53.959 --> 36:58.125
and they ask him if he would
go down to the canyon
for a reenactment.

36:58.209 --> 37:02.083
He was put on a metal leash,
drug around this canyon,

37:02.167 --> 37:06.584
and he explained,
to dozens of reporters,

37:06.667 --> 37:09.042
how he committed
the Starved Rock murders.

37:09.125 --> 37:12.792
Reporter:
Sheriff's deputies take
the place of the women

37:12.876 --> 37:15.584
as Weger reenacts the crime.

37:15.667 --> 37:18.667
Steve:
He saw the women
come down this way.

37:18.751 --> 37:21.834
Reporter:
He says he tried to grab
the purse of one woman,

37:21.918 --> 37:23.292
and found it was a camera.

37:23.375 --> 37:25.792
The three women were cowed
into letting him tie them up,

37:25.876 --> 37:28.626
to give him a chance
to get away, which they did.

37:28.709 --> 37:30.918
So, when he turns
to leave the canyon,

37:31.000 --> 37:34.167
one of the women broke
free from their bonds,
ran out behind him,

37:34.250 --> 37:37.626
and started beating him
in the back of the head
with a pair of binoculars.

37:37.709 --> 37:39.334
Reporter:
Mrs. Murphy came after him.

37:39.417 --> 37:41.918
He then picked up a broken limb
of a tree and clubbed her.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.751
Steve:
He picks up a frozen tree log,

37:44.834 --> 37:48.334
he turns and he hits her,
she goes down.

37:48.417 --> 37:51.667
He instantly realizes
he has to go back,

37:51.751 --> 37:53.709
and do damage
to the other two women

37:53.792 --> 37:57.250
to prevent identification,
and that's just what he does.

37:57.334 --> 37:59.792
Reporter:
So, he clubbed
them to death, too.

37:59.876 --> 38:01.459
Steve:
He rips up their clothes.

38:01.542 --> 38:04.125
He says he wanted to make
it look like it was a rape,

38:04.209 --> 38:05.751
a rapist did this crime.

38:05.834 --> 38:10.334
He wanted money.
That's all he wanted
was money, green paper.

38:10.417 --> 38:13.500
It's all about green paper.
That's what he wanted.

38:15.292 --> 38:17.626
Kathy:
You know, I liked thinking
that my grandmother

38:17.709 --> 38:21.083
was the feisty one,
you know, who--

38:21.167 --> 38:24.417
You know, 'cause, again,
the way we understood the story,

38:24.500 --> 38:26.500
you know, you should
just lie there.

38:26.584 --> 38:29.542
Don't stand up and go,
you know, if--

38:29.626 --> 38:34.042
I don't know.
I liked thinking that
she was this feisty lady

38:34.125 --> 38:36.250
who would stick up
for her friends.

38:37.375 --> 38:40.042
(Reporter speaking)

38:40.125 --> 38:43.375
Oh, yes, he, uh,
at times he, uh,

38:43.459 --> 38:44.584
showed a lot of sadness,

38:44.667 --> 38:47.459
shed a few tears
from time to time.

38:47.542 --> 38:51.000
He signed every page
of his confession.

38:51.083 --> 38:52.667
He didn't sign at the end.

38:52.751 --> 38:57.667
Every single page
of this confession,

38:57.751 --> 39:01.959
and this is the real deal here,
has his signature on it.

39:02.042 --> 39:03.709
David:
After the reenactment,

39:03.792 --> 39:08.125
he confessed again
to multiple people.

39:08.209 --> 39:11.751
Not once, not twice,
not three times, nine times.

39:12.584 --> 39:14.417
But within 24 hours,

39:14.500 --> 39:17.334
he recanted the confession,
he said he didn't do it.

39:17.417 --> 39:19.542
He said, "I'm gonna sign
the confession,

39:19.626 --> 39:23.042
and I'm gonna prove
my innocence in the courtroom."

39:25.542 --> 39:28.000
David:
You've covered everything
I need covered.

39:28.083 --> 39:29.834
My goal is to--

39:29.918 --> 39:31.667
I'm doing, I'm,
I'm doing exactly--

39:31.751 --> 39:33.083
I'll be interested in your goal.

39:33.167 --> 39:35.375
I'm doing exactly what you're
asking me to do--

39:35.459 --> 39:38.417
If you weren't the son
of Mr. Raccuglia,

39:38.500 --> 39:41.792
I would question your motives.

39:41.876 --> 39:43.959
-I know you know he's guilty.
-Ask me.

39:44.042 --> 39:45.542
I know you know he's guilty.

39:45.626 --> 39:47.751
I know the old man
knows he's guilty.

39:47.834 --> 39:52.125
What is your... point of view?

39:52.209 --> 39:55.584
Because I certainly
wanted to know if
you're the Free Chester--

39:55.667 --> 39:57.167
part of the Free Chester Weger
movement,

39:57.250 --> 39:59.167
and that's what
most documentaries do.

39:59.250 --> 40:02.292
They search out a injustice,
try to correct this.

40:02.375 --> 40:05.584
There was not
any injustice in this case

40:05.667 --> 40:09.959
until the LaSalle County
Appellate Defender's Office
reopened it,

40:10.042 --> 40:11.918
and that's the injustice.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.250
Do I believe if he's innocent
or if he's guilty,

40:15.334 --> 40:17.334
and also, as a filmmaker,
I don't wanna answer.

40:17.417 --> 40:19.000
I just wanna keep pointin'
the camera--

40:19.083 --> 40:21.584
Oh, right, I'm, I'm
talking as a son.

40:23.959 --> 40:26.834
One second, let us
get that underneath ya.

40:26.918 --> 40:28.042
-Okay.
-All right.

40:28.125 --> 40:29.876
I remember going to my father,

40:29.959 --> 40:31.125
and telling him that

40:31.209 --> 40:32.667
I didn't wanna go to college.

40:32.751 --> 40:34.834
I wanted to be
a hairdresser.

40:34.918 --> 40:37.125
That was a big pill
for my father to swallow.

40:37.209 --> 40:40.167
My father really wanted me
to be an attorney.

40:40.250 --> 40:42.167
He didn't want me
to waste my intellect.

40:42.250 --> 40:44.834
My sister became a judge.

40:44.918 --> 40:47.876
I, personally, was a little bit
of a hippy at heart.

40:47.959 --> 40:50.959
I wanted to be
in a creative field,
see the world.

40:51.042 --> 40:53.292
Ultimately, he came to me,
and he said,

40:53.375 --> 40:57.584
"Look, you wanna be
a hairstylist,
you need to be the best."

40:57.667 --> 41:01.334
I moved to London, England,
I opened salons.

41:01.417 --> 41:04.250
I did hair shows,
I worked for product companies.

41:04.334 --> 41:07.876
You know, I had an incredibly
great career that brought me
all around the world.

41:07.959 --> 41:10.042
But then, Donna Kelly decided

41:10.125 --> 41:12.209
that she was going to reopen

41:12.292 --> 41:13.792
Chester Weger's case.

41:13.876 --> 41:15.542
It just hit me.

41:15.626 --> 41:19.667
I had to know why
he signed that confession.

41:19.751 --> 41:22.292
This film became more than just,

41:22.375 --> 41:25.167
"Oh, I'm gonna make a film."
It became an obsession to me.

41:25.250 --> 41:31.000
I give my father
a lot of credit because
he wasn't against it,

41:31.083 --> 41:33.500
but he thought it was a waste
of time and money

41:33.584 --> 41:37.876
'cause my father
believes in his guilt.

41:37.959 --> 41:42.417
Anthony:
Frankly, arrests should've been
made much earlier than that.

41:42.500 --> 41:46.167
I was surprised
that Harland Warren waited
until after the election.

41:46.250 --> 41:49.918
That would've really helped
getting himself back in office

41:50.000 --> 41:54.375
because the big issue
in that campaign was
the Starved Rock murder.

41:54.459 --> 41:59.459
Harland:
My opponent ran ads that
I was bungling the evidence.

41:59.542 --> 42:01.709
But then,
if we'd brought him in,

42:01.792 --> 42:03.918
and got the confession
before the election,

42:04.000 --> 42:07.167
they'd say,
"Oh, the state's attorney,
in order to save his hide,

42:07.250 --> 42:09.500
forced a confession
out of him."

42:09.584 --> 42:14.209
So, for that reason, we waited
'til after the, the election.

42:14.292 --> 42:16.667
Of course, I was soundly beaten.

42:16.751 --> 42:18.209
(chuckles)

42:18.292 --> 42:20.125
Steve:
A case that he solved,

42:20.209 --> 42:21.709
he never got
to try it in court,

42:21.792 --> 42:25.125
but he laid out a great plan
for the next state's attorney,

42:25.209 --> 42:27.000
Robert Richardson, a good man.

42:27.083 --> 42:30.083
But he'd never handled
a criminal case before,

42:30.167 --> 42:33.292
and Tony Raccuglia,
his first assistant,

42:33.375 --> 42:35.125
fresh out of law school,

42:35.209 --> 42:38.667
so we had two guys
in charge of prosecuting

42:38.751 --> 42:43.459
the most important criminal case
of 1960 in America,

42:43.542 --> 42:46.584
never tried a criminal case.

42:46.667 --> 42:48.667
Imagine the pressure they felt.

42:55.542 --> 42:56.918
Yes, it is.

43:19.125 --> 43:21.292
David:
The first time
I walked into this courtroom

43:21.375 --> 43:23.626
when I was making
this documentary,

43:23.709 --> 43:25.584
I had a stack of photos,

43:25.667 --> 43:29.125
and I was looking at this room,
and I was looking
at these little tables

43:29.209 --> 43:34.000
where my father tried the case,
with no experience.

43:34.083 --> 43:35.792
And there were
people everywhere.

43:35.876 --> 43:37.292
People couldn't wait to get in.

43:37.375 --> 43:40.125
It was like
a Bruce Springsteen concert.

43:41.626 --> 43:45.083
Anthony:
While it was a great deal
of responsibility,

43:45.167 --> 43:48.834
I also, selfishly, looked
at it as a way to prove

43:48.918 --> 43:53.626
that I was capable of doing
trial work at 26 years of age.

43:53.709 --> 43:58.042
There were magazines
and newspapers
from all over the world.

43:58.125 --> 44:00.334
Bill:
Chester's conduct
during the trial,

44:00.417 --> 44:02.000
and during other
public appearances

44:02.083 --> 44:05.751
really seemed quite strange.
He seemed to be enjoying
the notoriety.

44:05.834 --> 44:08.417
John:
At that time, he was known
as Rocky Weger, not Chester.

44:08.500 --> 44:10.918
Rocky Weger, ex-Marine
they always billed him as.

44:11.000 --> 44:14.334
I think he had the "Rocky"
tattooed on his arm
if I recall.

44:14.417 --> 44:15.959
He gave that impression
with that swagger,

44:16.042 --> 44:18.042
that type of tough guy
with the little duck tail.

44:18.125 --> 44:19.959
Oh yeah, he was not eating
humble pie in those days,

44:20.042 --> 44:22.000
I don't think.
No, no, no, no.

44:22.083 --> 44:23.167
Bill:
They'd be leading him
to the courtroom,

44:23.250 --> 44:25.334
and the guys would
shout questions.

44:25.417 --> 44:27.751
"Rocky this" and "Rocky that,"
and he loved it.

44:27.834 --> 44:30.459
He, kind of, enjoyed being
the center of attention.

44:30.542 --> 44:31.834
Anthony:
He was the star.

44:31.918 --> 44:33.626
He was gonna be the person

44:33.709 --> 44:36.876
who would make or break
the evidence in the case.

44:40.918 --> 44:43.626
David:
In the trial, my father
didn't really have

44:43.709 --> 44:46.167
a lot of huge evidence

44:46.250 --> 44:50.459
besides the scratches
and the suede jacket.

44:52.292 --> 44:57.709
The suede jacket was a big part
of the prosecution's case

44:57.792 --> 45:03.334
because of blood spatters
that were found
of human strain.

45:03.417 --> 45:06.125
It was spattered human blood

45:06.209 --> 45:10.209
by repeated blows
in a bloody area,

45:10.292 --> 45:12.000
and I hit heavy on that.

45:12.083 --> 45:15.083
That was one of the keys
to this case, and the scratches.

45:15.167 --> 45:19.417
We did bring in a number
of kitchen employees
from the lodge,

45:19.500 --> 45:24.125
and they all said that his face
was pretty badly scratched.

45:24.209 --> 45:27.792
And then, of course,
Stanley Tucker
was a friend of Chester,

45:27.876 --> 45:29.626
colleague at the lodge.

45:29.709 --> 45:32.250
Stanley Tucker also said
that Chester Weger

45:32.334 --> 45:36.209
had scratches on his face
at the time of the murder.

45:36.292 --> 45:39.292
Anthony:
That afternoon, the comments
in the kitchen were,

45:39.375 --> 45:43.083
"Your face looks like you were
in a fight with a cat,"

45:43.167 --> 45:46.083
and his answers were that,
"I cut myself shaving."

45:46.167 --> 45:48.125
There is absolutely no way

45:48.209 --> 45:52.709
that those types of scratches
could've come from shaving.

45:52.792 --> 45:55.792
Anything you can tell us
about how you're gonna
conduct the trial?

45:55.876 --> 45:59.125
Well, as much as I can
tell you at this time is

45:59.209 --> 46:01.792
that Chester will take
the stand in his own defense.

46:01.876 --> 46:04.209
Anthony:
Chester Weger was a very cocky,

46:04.292 --> 46:07.792
very assured man,
who was of the impression

46:07.876 --> 46:10.000
that he was gonna
beat this rap.

46:10.083 --> 46:12.876
I sat with Bob Richardson,
and he said to me,

46:12.959 --> 46:16.500
"I don't wanna
cross-examine him.
I don't think I can.

46:16.584 --> 46:19.042
You're gonna have
to cross-examine Weger."

46:21.209 --> 46:23.667
David:
My father had
never tried anything

46:23.751 --> 46:25.709
near the Starved Rock murders.

46:25.792 --> 46:27.626
He was 26 years old.

46:27.709 --> 46:30.417
But he was superhuman
in a lot of ways.

46:30.500 --> 46:33.626
I can, I can only
picture him in his 20s

46:33.709 --> 46:37.042
with something to prove.

46:37.125 --> 46:38.876
Anthony:
In those days,

46:38.959 --> 46:42.167
you could put your nose
right up to the witness.

46:42.250 --> 46:45.209
Sort of the rough
and tumble trial days,
and that's what I did.

46:45.292 --> 46:49.042
I got within nose to nose
of him, and I said,

46:49.125 --> 46:51.709
"You killed three women."

46:51.792 --> 46:56.042
And that set the tone
for my cross-examination.

46:57.918 --> 47:03.250
My goal was to make
his answers so unreasonable,

47:03.334 --> 47:04.626
so ludicrous,

47:04.709 --> 47:07.167
that the jury
would have to believe

47:07.250 --> 47:08.834
that what he was telling me

47:08.918 --> 47:11.834
in response to my questions
were lies.

47:14.584 --> 47:16.334
I said to him,

47:16.417 --> 47:20.334
"Chester, if you really
believe you're innocent,

47:20.417 --> 47:23.250
why did you confess?"

47:23.334 --> 47:26.500
He said that Dummett
and Hess told him,

47:26.584 --> 47:29.083
if he didn't confess,

47:29.167 --> 47:32.417
they would do something
harmful to his wife.

47:32.500 --> 47:35.542
And then, I reversed gears
and said,

47:35.626 --> 47:37.167
"But your alibi is

47:37.250 --> 47:40.834
"that you were writing
a love letter to another woman

47:40.918 --> 47:44.209
who you said you were
in love with at the time."

47:44.292 --> 47:46.375
And he had no answer for that.

47:46.459 --> 47:48.292
I mean, he, he
didn't have an alibi.

47:48.375 --> 47:51.626
The alibi that he presented
was that he was alone,

47:51.709 --> 47:56.334
alone writing a letter,
which can be verified
by no one.

47:58.334 --> 48:01.918
Through questioning Weger,
I wanted to show

48:02.000 --> 48:05.500
that the confession was
corroborated by other evidence.

48:05.584 --> 48:07.209
So, I would say to him,

48:07.292 --> 48:09.792
"How did you know
about the red airplane?"

48:09.876 --> 48:11.250
(airplane flying over)

48:11.334 --> 48:14.792
Steve:
The key to the whole confession
is the airplane.

48:14.876 --> 48:18.209
After he had killed
the three women,

48:18.292 --> 48:21.250
he moved the bodies
up to a little overhang,
a cave-like area.

48:21.334 --> 48:25.375
Uh, Hess and Dummett ask him
a very important question,
"Why'd you move the bodies?"

48:25.459 --> 48:28.459
-(airplane flying over)
-He hears a sound.

48:28.542 --> 48:30.209
And he looks up,

48:30.292 --> 48:34.918
and he's seen a red and white
airplane flying over.

48:35.000 --> 48:38.584
He thinks it might be
one of the Illinois
State Police planes,

48:38.667 --> 48:41.500
so he intentionally moves
'em into the cave here

48:41.584 --> 48:44.459
to prevent any
aerial identification.

48:44.542 --> 48:49.083
So then, I said,
"Well, I guess we better find
that red and white plane,"

48:49.167 --> 48:52.918
so go out to the Ottawa Airport.

48:53.000 --> 48:55.834
There was a red
and white plane.

48:55.918 --> 48:57.959
Steve:
They call the pilot.

48:58.042 --> 49:01.083
The pilot confirms he flew
over Starved Rock State Park

49:01.167 --> 49:02.667
on March 14th.

49:02.751 --> 49:07.459
If Weger wasn't here, how did
he know about the airplane?

49:08.959 --> 49:12.500
I don't see any way
to explain that.

49:12.584 --> 49:17.459
In fact, there was a carving
that they found in the cave...

49:17.542 --> 49:18.500
said, "Rocky."

49:18.584 --> 49:20.626
They called him Rocky.

49:22.500 --> 49:25.042
Anthony:
We had the circumstantial
evidence,

49:25.125 --> 49:26.918
we had the confessions,

49:27.000 --> 49:30.542
and we had truth on our side.

49:30.626 --> 49:32.542
Chester Weger
was given a fair trial,

49:32.626 --> 49:36.375
and was convicted,
not by Tony Raccuglia,
not by Harland Warren,

49:36.459 --> 49:39.709
but a jury of 12 peers.

49:39.792 --> 49:42.083
We argued
for the death penalty,

49:42.167 --> 49:44.083
and then, the jury
came back with life.

49:44.167 --> 49:47.542
We couldn't tell the jury
that if he got life,

49:47.626 --> 49:52.459
it wasn't life,
that he could be out
in 11 years with parole.

49:55.918 --> 49:58.125
(Reporter 1 speaking)

50:01.584 --> 50:03.000
Reporter 2:
You don't call this lucky?

50:03.042 --> 50:04.125
No, sir, I don't.

50:04.209 --> 50:06.584
Reporter 2:
Well, who framed you, Chester?

50:18.167 --> 50:20.876
Anthony:
I'm always contacted
by the parole board

50:20.959 --> 50:24.209
when Chester Weger
applies for parole.

50:24.292 --> 50:26.959
What do I want to say?

50:27.042 --> 50:32.542
And, of course, I wanna say
I never wanna see Chester Weger
walk the streets.

50:34.459 --> 50:38.083
Kathy:
You know, growing up,
I think we felt some safety

50:38.167 --> 50:41.375
that he would be in prison
for his whole life,

50:41.459 --> 50:44.709
and then we learned
that there was gonna be
a parole hearing,

50:44.792 --> 50:46.709
and it was outrageous.

50:46.792 --> 50:50.792
Just seemed unfathomable
that they would let him
out of prison.

50:50.876 --> 50:52.542
I mean, he murdered three women.

50:52.626 --> 50:55.959
How, how could he ever
be let out of prison?

50:56.042 --> 50:57.792
He was given a life sentence.

50:57.876 --> 50:59.417
That's just not right.

51:00.876 --> 51:03.334
Rod:
...might be able to stay
in the studio.

51:03.417 --> 51:06.292
I'm Rod Thorson,
and live on WLPO

51:06.375 --> 51:07.918
is attorney Anthony Raccuglia.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.500
Tony, now we know you've
been a staunch advocate

51:10.584 --> 51:12.459
for keeping Chester Weger
behind bars.

51:12.542 --> 51:15.292
Uh, he comes up
almost every year now,
doesn't he, for parole?

51:15.375 --> 51:17.918
Anthony (on phone):
Yeah, this thing really
disturbs me because

51:18.000 --> 51:20.751
the fact of the matter is,
he's 74 years old.

51:20.834 --> 51:23.959
There's a lot of 74-year-old
people that kill people.

51:24.042 --> 51:26.209
Right after
the verdict came in...

51:29.125 --> 51:31.334
-Rod: Hmm.
-Anthony: Now, I'm not
interested in being

51:31.417 --> 51:35.292
a part of a revenge
situation from Mr. Weger

51:35.375 --> 51:37.751
if he gets out of prison,
me or my family.

51:37.834 --> 51:42.167
-Rod: Right.
-Anthony: So, you know,
the truth is, keep him there.

51:48.584 --> 51:51.250
David:
Think it was three years
into the making,

51:51.334 --> 51:54.500
I received a letter
from Chester Weger

51:54.584 --> 51:57.626
saying he would allow
me to interview him,

51:57.709 --> 51:59.792
and then, I would have to
go through the process

51:59.876 --> 52:02.417
of filming in
Menard Correctional Center.

52:02.500 --> 52:05.500
And, you know,
Menard is not, uh, an easy--

52:05.584 --> 52:08.626
It's not like--
You don't walk in, and--
with cameras and a crew.

52:08.709 --> 52:10.959
There's a lot
of criminals there

52:11.042 --> 52:13.792
that have committed
mass murders.

52:13.876 --> 52:16.459
It's a very rough prison.

52:22.417 --> 52:24.918
This is everything
I worked for.

52:25.000 --> 52:28.626
I really was ready
for that interview.

52:28.709 --> 52:33.584
But when that date finally came,
I was in panic.

52:33.667 --> 52:37.834
There's a guy pointing
a rifle at me up in the tower,

52:37.918 --> 52:39.667
and I didn't sleep
the night before,

52:39.751 --> 52:42.626
and the, the closer
I got to the prison,

52:42.709 --> 52:45.542
the more panicky
I started to get.

52:45.626 --> 52:47.876
I mean, I-I'll have
to be very honest,

52:47.959 --> 52:49.876
I think it was, probably,

52:50.000 --> 52:53.292
one of the most
fearful moments I've had.

52:53.375 --> 52:56.417
You know, it wasn't that I was
scared he was gonna harm me.

52:56.500 --> 53:00.375
I kinda wanted him
to like me, I guess.

53:00.459 --> 53:02.500
I wanted him to trust me.

53:07.792 --> 53:10.918
Chester was put
in this little side room,

53:11.000 --> 53:14.459
and one of my producers
said, "He's ready."

53:18.292 --> 53:23.375
I was going to film
my boogieman, Chester Weger.

53:25.751 --> 53:29.584
The one thing I remember is
the look on Chester's face.

53:35.334 --> 53:39.667
Chester, I'm glad you, finally,
decided to talk to me.

53:39.751 --> 53:43.792
How has, how has your life
been the last 46 years?

53:43.876 --> 53:48.876
How, how have you survived
being in prison knowing that--

53:48.959 --> 53:51.500
all that you know
in regards to your--

53:51.584 --> 53:54.000
Let me, let me say
that one more time.
I'm sorry, I said it terribly.

53:54.083 --> 53:56.500
I couldn't talk at first.

53:57.834 --> 53:59.751
I was stumbling with my words,

53:59.834 --> 54:03.667
and I-I'm sure he could sense,
you know, the nerves.

54:03.751 --> 54:05.792
I, I was very, very nervous.

54:05.876 --> 54:09.334
How has your life been
being in prison?

54:09.417 --> 54:12.542
I don't know,
I, I come to the penitentiary,

54:12.626 --> 54:14.959
and when you first
come in the penitentiary,

54:15.042 --> 54:18.542
it's, it's, it's
kinda scary at first,

54:18.626 --> 54:22.209
but I got, I've got used
to it, you know?

54:22.292 --> 54:26.500
I go through every day
living one day to the next,

54:26.584 --> 54:29.500
knowing I'm innocent, or...

54:30.417 --> 54:32.167
trying to prove my innocence.

54:32.250 --> 54:34.876
That's what I've
always known, uh,

54:34.959 --> 54:38.459
and I know that someday
that people will realize this,

54:38.542 --> 54:41.000
and I will be out of prison.

54:42.584 --> 54:46.918
David:
Why did you decide now
is a good time to talk to us?

55:04.459 --> 55:09.209
My mother died in 2000.
I lost my father in '96.

55:09.292 --> 55:13.083
My kids, you know,
they, they had no father.

55:13.167 --> 55:15.292
My wife died.

55:17.334 --> 55:21.292
David:
The confession is
why you're in prison.

55:21.375 --> 55:23.083
Why did you sign it?

55:23.167 --> 55:26.167
(Chester speaking)

56:04.959 --> 56:09.542
At least people will know
what they've done to me.

56:12.667 --> 56:15.667
If I have to die in prison...

56:17.834 --> 56:20.959
people at least know
what they've done.

56:25.626 --> 56:29.542
I said they, they can't
hurt me no more.

56:29.626 --> 56:32.167
They done all they
could do to me.

56:32.250 --> 56:34.542
The only thing
I can do now is die.

56:34.626 --> 56:39.000
They took everything I had,
everything I ever wanted.

56:42.626 --> 56:45.584
David:
I expected this man
to be arrogant and mean,

56:45.667 --> 56:50.918
and I really saw
the humanity in him.

56:52.083 --> 56:54.709
I never killed these people.

56:56.209 --> 56:59.250
David:
I was emotionally distraught
for Chester Weger.

56:59.334 --> 57:02.167
And the first thing I wanted
to do was speak to my father.

57:02.250 --> 57:04.751
I said, "Dad, come on."

57:04.834 --> 57:08.709
Do you really believe that I
would ask for the death penalty

57:08.792 --> 57:10.459
if I didn't think
they were guilty,

57:10.542 --> 57:13.500
and didn't have the evidence
to convince me they were guilty?

57:13.584 --> 57:16.834
Well, I mean, I think
you believe in your heart

57:16.918 --> 57:18.042
that he was guilty,

57:18.125 --> 57:19.542
I mean, I--
People are wrong.

57:19.626 --> 57:24.083
If there's information that
might make this man innocent,

57:24.167 --> 57:26.083
I wanted to expose
it to the world.

57:26.167 --> 57:28.083
Cameraperson:
Perfect, Chester, right there.

57:28.167 --> 57:32.751
David:
This very tidy case that
my father told me about,

57:32.834 --> 57:35.042
a man confessed,
he went to jail,

57:35.125 --> 57:39.250
turned out to be a ten-year
rollercoaster ride for me.

57:44.250 --> 57:47.375
(pensive music playing)
