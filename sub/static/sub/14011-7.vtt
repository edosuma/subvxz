WEBVTT

00:01.535 --> 00:05.070
<i>BY TWO SEPARATE</i>
<i>YET EQUALLY IMPORTANT GROUPS:</i>

00:05.072 --> 00:07.206
<i> THE POLICE,</i>
<i> WHO INVESTIGATE CRIME</i>

00:07.208 --> 00:09.441
<i>AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS</i>
<i>WHO PROSECUTE THE OFFENDERS.</i>

00:09.443 --> 00:11.443
<i>THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.</i>

00:22.556 --> 00:25.090
SO WE WENT TO THIS PLACE
YOU KNOW, THIS S.R.O.

00:25.092 --> 00:26.358
IT'S UP ON 113th STREET.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.160
AND WE HEAR THIS GUY

00:28.162 --> 00:30.329
MUFFLED-LIKE,
GOING, "HELP! HELP!"

00:30.331 --> 00:32.131
BUT INSIDE SOMEPLACE.

00:32.133 --> 00:33.132
WE SEARCH.

00:33.134 --> 00:34.500
WE CAN'T FIND THIS GUY.

00:34.502 --> 00:37.369
I MEAN, THIS ROOM
IS MAYBE 12 BY 12.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.638
THERE'S NOT A LOT
OF SPACE TO HIDE.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.140
CAN'T FIND HIM

00:41.142 --> 00:44.209
UNTIL HANDLER LOOKS UP
AND SEES THIS GUY--

00:44.211 --> 00:45.277
JAYBIRD NAKED--

00:45.279 --> 00:47.246
GAFFER-TAPED
TO THE CEILING.

00:47.248 --> 00:48.113
(<i> screams</i> )

00:48.115 --> 00:49.448
HEY! HEY!

00:49.450 --> 00:52.518
MY DOG-- HE JUST FOUND
SOMETHING DOWN THERE.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.386
I THINK IT'S A GUY
OR SOMETHING.

00:54.388 --> 00:55.387
I DON'T KNOW.

00:55.389 --> 00:57.189
HE'S DEAD OR HURT.

00:57.191 --> 00:58.190
OH, MY GOD.

00:58.192 --> 00:59.191
SOMEBODY...

00:59.193 --> 01:01.393
RIGHT DOWN THERE.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.328
BACK HERE?

01:03.330 --> 01:04.663
IT'S RIGHT OVER HERE.

01:04.665 --> 01:08.167
AT FIRST, I THOUGHT
IT WAS A GLOVE OR SOMETHING.

01:08.169 --> 01:09.168
AND, UH...

01:09.170 --> 01:10.069
LOOK AT IT.

01:15.509 --> 01:18.177
Walkie-talkie:
186 Lincoln...

01:18.179 --> 01:19.144
READY TO LIFT?

01:19.146 --> 01:20.145
YEAH.

01:22.516 --> 01:23.949
GO.

01:23.950 --> 01:25.383
HE'S HURT PRETTY BAD,
BUT HE'S NOT DEAD.

01:25.386 --> 01:26.385
I.D.?

01:26.387 --> 01:27.853
NOPE, NOTHING ON HIM.

01:27.855 --> 01:31.290
HEY, BOBBY, MAKE SURE
YOU BAG IT ALL.

01:31.292 --> 01:36.395
(<i> siren</i> )

01:36.397 --> 01:38.464
Greevey:
HE GOING TO WAKE UP?

01:38.466 --> 01:41.166
THE NURSES' POOL SAYS NO.

01:41.168 --> 01:42.401
HOW MUCH IS IN THE POT?

01:42.403 --> 01:44.303
UH, 30 BUCKS.

01:44.305 --> 01:47.206
IF THEY WERE SURE,
THERE WOULD BE A HUNDRED.

01:47.208 --> 01:48.640
HE'S GOT A SHOT.

01:48.642 --> 01:50.309
LET ME SHOW YOU.

01:50.311 --> 01:52.244
THERE'S A HAIRLINE FRACTURE

01:52.246 --> 01:53.645
AND SUBDURAL HEMATOMA.

01:53.647 --> 01:56.548
BAD ENOUGH, BUT IT LOOKS
WORSE THAN IT IS.

01:56.550 --> 01:58.383
RIGHT, JUST A LOVE TAP.

01:58.385 --> 02:00.519
THEY WEREN'T TRYING TO KILL HIM.

02:00.521 --> 02:03.188
HIS FAMILY WILL
FIND THAT COMFORTING.

02:03.190 --> 02:05.591
THE HEAD ISN'T AS BAD
AS THE HEART ATTACK.

02:05.593 --> 02:06.592
HEART ATTACK?

02:06.594 --> 02:08.227
CAUSED BY THE BLOW?

02:08.229 --> 02:09.595
IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL.

02:09.597 --> 02:12.598
HE COULD HAVE HAD
THE HEART ATTACK FIRST.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.700
BUT THERE IS ONE ODD THING.

02:14.702 --> 02:15.601
YEAH?

02:15.603 --> 02:16.735
HIS UNDERPANTS

02:16.737 --> 02:18.403
WERE ON BACKWARDS.

03:48.796 --> 03:50.229
WHAT THE HELL
IS THAT?

03:50.231 --> 03:50.796
GLASS EYE.

03:50.798 --> 03:51.830
GARBAGE.

03:51.832 --> 03:53.565
HEY, LISTEN TO THIS.

03:53.567 --> 03:54.833
WHEN I WORKED THE 9th

03:54.835 --> 03:57.603
WE GET A SCRATCH,
TOMPKINS SQUARE.

03:57.605 --> 04:00.305
SO WE NOSE AROUND THE PARK,
THE STREETS...

04:00.307 --> 04:02.574
WHAT DO WE FIND
UNDER THE BENCH?

04:02.576 --> 04:03.675
A HUMAN HAND

04:03.677 --> 04:05.978
WITH THE WATCH STILL
ON THE WRIST

04:05.980 --> 04:06.979
TICKING.

04:06.981 --> 04:07.980
EWW!

04:07.982 --> 04:10.582
BRONTOSAURUS REX-- GARBAGE.

04:10.584 --> 04:13.252
ROLLING PAPERS.

04:13.254 --> 04:14.553
MAYBE.

04:18.993 --> 04:20.325
BINGO!

04:23.597 --> 04:25.664
ALL RIGHT.

04:25.666 --> 04:27.966
7:00 OR 8:00, I DON'T KNOW.

04:27.968 --> 04:30.936
DINNER WAS ON THE TABLE
WHEN HE CALLED.

04:30.938 --> 04:33.005
DID YOU KNOW
WHERE HE WAS GOING?

04:33.007 --> 04:35.274
JUST THAT HE HAD
TO WORK LATE

04:35.276 --> 04:36.275
AND, UH...

04:36.277 --> 04:37.709
I'M SORRY.

04:37.711 --> 04:41.013
I WAS UP MOST OF THE NIGHT.

04:41.015 --> 04:45.350
P.A.:
Mr. Kirsch to Medical Records.

04:45.352 --> 04:51.056
THESE PICTURES JUST CAME BACK
FROM BEING PROCESSED.

04:51.058 --> 04:53.058
MAY I?

04:55.629 --> 04:56.995
Woman:
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

04:56.997 --> 05:00.732
IRV DOESN'T WORK ANYWHERE
NEAR CENTRAL PARK.

05:00.734 --> 05:03.001
Logan:
WHERE DOES HE WORK?

05:03.003 --> 05:05.837
Greevey:
...SO YOU LEFT WITH MR. DIAMOND?

05:05.839 --> 05:07.072
Woman:
ABOUT 5:30.

05:07.074 --> 05:09.941
HE SAID HE WANTED
TO DISCUSS RECEIVABLES

05:09.943 --> 05:12.344
OVER A DRINK AT JANGLES.

05:12.346 --> 05:15.347
DID YOU DO A LOT OF WORK
WITH HIM OVER DRINKS?

05:15.349 --> 05:17.949
I LIKE MY JOB,
BUT NOT THAT MUCH.

05:19.987 --> 05:20.919
THANK YOU.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.963
SURE, I REMEMBER HIM.

05:31.965 --> 05:34.599
COMES IN HERE
ONCE OR TWICE A MONTH.

05:34.601 --> 05:35.734
WINDOW SHOPPING.

05:35.736 --> 05:37.836
THEN HE GOES HOME
TO THE WIFEY.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.705
WHAT ABOUT LAST NIGHT?

05:39.707 --> 05:41.106
HE'S WITH SOME KNOCKOUT

05:41.108 --> 05:44.009
WHO'S PRETENDING
SHE'S GOT NOTHING TO LOOK AT.

05:44.011 --> 05:46.611
I WOULDN'T GO
<i> NEAR</i> ONE LIKE THAT.

05:46.613 --> 05:50.682
I MEAN, FIRST IT'S
"DON'T TOUCH, DON'T TOUCH."

05:50.684 --> 05:52.818
AND THEN IT'S,
"WHY NOT? WHY NOT?"

05:52.820 --> 05:54.052
HUH?

05:54.054 --> 05:56.888
DID YOU THINK THEY
WERE GOING TO SWIM

05:56.890 --> 05:58.724
OR JUST SIT
ON THE BEACH?

05:58.726 --> 06:00.058
SHE WASN'T INTERESTED.

06:00.060 --> 06:01.793
THE GUY WAS IN HEAT.

06:01.795 --> 06:03.061
HE'S PAWING HER.

06:03.063 --> 06:05.864
SHE'S GOT ZERO INTEREST
AND SHE WALKS.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.099
AND?

06:07.101 --> 06:09.835
AND IN COME
THE B-B-Qs.

06:09.837 --> 06:13.905
BROOKLYN, BRONX, QUEENS--
THE BRIDGE AND TUNNEL SET.

06:13.907 --> 06:17.142
TEASED-HAIR TEASERS.

06:17.144 --> 06:20.712
HE GOES AFTER THREE IN A ROW--
BIM, BAM, BOM.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.848
THE MIKE TYSON OF ROMANCE.

06:22.850 --> 06:25.417
I MEAN, DEAD MEAT.

06:25.419 --> 06:27.886
SO, I BUY HIM A DRINK

06:27.888 --> 06:32.724
HE BUYS HIMSELF A COUPLE
OR THREE MORE AND, UH...

06:32.726 --> 06:36.128
BY THE TIME HE LEFT,
HE COULDN'T WALK.

06:36.130 --> 06:37.462
HMM.

06:37.464 --> 06:39.030
THANKS.

06:44.104 --> 06:45.137
ANOTHER STRIKEOUT.

06:45.139 --> 06:46.138
WHAT'S LEFT?

06:46.140 --> 06:48.140
WITHIN FIVE BLOCKS
OF THAT BAR

06:48.142 --> 06:51.643
WE'VE GOT THE PEQUOT,
THE STANDISH, THE STANLEY.

06:51.645 --> 06:52.644
THEN PAST THAT...

06:52.646 --> 06:53.779
IN HIS CONDITION

06:53.781 --> 06:56.748
YOU THINK HE MADE
MORE THAN FIVE BLOCKS?

06:56.750 --> 06:57.983
LET'S WORK THE PHONES.

06:57.985 --> 07:00.485
NO, I DON'T WANT THIS
TO GET COLD.

07:00.487 --> 07:02.154
IT'S JUST A LITTLE
HUMMA-HUMMA.

07:02.156 --> 07:03.755
DID YOU SEE
THE PICTURES?

07:03.757 --> 07:06.024
LOTS OF VICS GOT KIDS.

07:06.026 --> 07:08.994
YEAH, AND UNTIL YOU HAVE SOME,
YOU WON'T UNDERSTAND.

07:11.031 --> 07:13.899
MR. DIAMOND? AH, YES.

07:13.901 --> 07:17.169
HE CHECKED IN
LAST NIGHT ABOUT 8:00.

07:17.171 --> 07:19.971
ALONE, NO LUGGAGE.

07:19.973 --> 07:21.072
GOLD CARD.

07:21.074 --> 07:23.041
MAID JUST CLEANED
HIS ROOM.

07:23.043 --> 07:25.043
THE MAID QUARTERS
ARE DOWNSTAIRS?

07:25.045 --> 07:26.044
UH-HUH.

07:26.046 --> 07:27.145
THANKS A LOT.

07:27.147 --> 07:28.780
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

07:28.782 --> 07:32.517
Greevey:
DID YOU CLEAN HIS ROOM
THIS MORNING?

07:32.519 --> 07:33.952
MM-HMM.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.721
DID YOU SEE ANYTHING
OUT OF THE ORDINARY?

07:36.723 --> 07:37.923
SIGNS OF A FIGHT?

07:37.925 --> 07:38.924
BLOOD?

07:38.926 --> 07:39.925
UH-UH.

07:39.927 --> 07:41.726
DID HE USE HIS BED?

07:41.728 --> 07:43.495
MM-HMM.

07:43.497 --> 07:45.997
DID YOU FIND ANYTHING
IN THE ROOM?

07:45.999 --> 07:46.998
MM-HMM.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.133
PLEASE GET IT.

07:48.135 --> 07:49.000
PLEASE.

08:02.082 --> 08:04.149
"PERSONALS FOR PLEASURE."

08:04.151 --> 08:05.951
OH, A SPORTS FAN.

08:05.953 --> 08:08.119
<i>GRACIAS.</i>

08:08.121 --> 08:11.089
COME ON, DON'T READ THAT
OR YOU'LL GO BLIND.

08:18.232 --> 08:20.098
WAIT A MINUTE.

08:23.136 --> 08:25.971
Man:
50 CENTS.

08:25.973 --> 08:28.540
I BEEN WORKING HOTELS
FOR 40 YEARS

08:28.542 --> 08:31.076
AND I AIN'T SEEN
A TWO-BIT TIP

08:31.078 --> 08:34.145
SINCE THOSE KENNEDYS
BEEN IN OFFICE.

08:34.147 --> 08:37.949
THEN THIS DUKE ASKED ME
ABOUT GETTING A GIRL.

08:37.951 --> 08:40.151
AND I TELL HIM

08:40.153 --> 08:42.988
A BIG TIPPER LIKE YOU
DON'T NEED NO GIRL.

08:42.990 --> 08:45.824
AND THAT'S WHEN HE ORDERED
THE CHAMPAGNE?

08:45.826 --> 08:46.925
NO, LATER.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.860
HE ORDERED TWO GLASSES

08:48.862 --> 08:51.930
SO I FIGURE HE SOLVED
THAT PROBLEM BY HIMSELF.

08:51.932 --> 08:54.799
NOW, WHEN I GET
TO HIS ROOM

08:54.801 --> 08:59.204
HE'S IN HIS DRAWERS AND SOCKS
AND ON THE BED IS THIS BLONDE--

08:59.206 --> 09:02.874
A CUTE LITTLE THING
WITH A FARM GIRL FACE.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.876
THE FARM GIRL GOT A NAME?

09:04.878 --> 09:06.144
EVERYONE GOT A NAME

09:06.146 --> 09:08.980
BUT HE DON'T CALL HER
NOTHING THAT I HEAR.

09:08.982 --> 09:10.982
THEY TALK
ABOUT ANYTHING?

09:10.984 --> 09:12.984
OH, SHE'S TALKING AND TALKING

09:12.986 --> 09:15.987
AND I FIGURE SHE'S TALKING
A LITTLE LOVEY

09:15.989 --> 09:17.622
BUT SHE WASN'T TALKING THAT.

09:17.624 --> 09:19.324
WHAT WERE THEY
TALKING ABOUT?

09:19.326 --> 09:20.959
POOL.

09:20.961 --> 09:23.061
(<i> laughing</i> )

09:23.063 --> 09:25.897
20th PRECINCT

WHO HAS A PROBLEM?

09:29.303 --> 09:30.835

09:30.837 --> 09:32.170
WELL, THAT'S HELPFUL.

RING A BELL?

09:39.980 --> 09:41.246

09:41.248 --> 09:43.615

09:45.252 --> 09:48.019
I DON'T KNOW HER LAST NAME.

09:48.021 --> 09:49.888
UH, GREEN LEAGUE, TUESDAYS.

09:49.890 --> 09:53.191

09:53.193 --> 09:54.960
WHAT'S HER TEAM?

09:54.962 --> 09:57.262

THE FEMME FATALES.

09:57.264 --> 09:58.597

HOW DOES SHE PAY?

10:06.006 --> 10:07.205

11:17.110 --> 11:18.410
LET'S TALK ABOUT IT

11:18.412 --> 11:21.446
AFTER YOU'VE BEEN MARRIED
20 OR 30 YEARS

11:21.448 --> 11:24.449
AND HAVE NOTHING MORE
TO LOOK FORWARD TO

11:24.451 --> 11:26.751
EXCEPT THE SAME HOME COOKING.

11:26.753 --> 11:28.186
YOU SAYING YOU'D DO IT?

11:28.188 --> 11:29.320
ME?

11:29.322 --> 11:30.422
AW, I'M LUCKY.

11:30.424 --> 11:31.423
I LIKE MY WIFE'S COOKING.

11:31.425 --> 11:35.160
BUT I DON'T JUDGE.

11:35.162 --> 11:38.296
YOU CAN NEVER KNOW
SOMEONE ELSE'S STORY.

11:38.298 --> 11:40.298
WAIT A MINUTE.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.399
POPPY CATERING?

11:41.401 --> 11:43.201
YEAH.

11:47.274 --> 11:50.442
"POPPY ESCORTS."

11:50.444 --> 11:53.211
(<i> imitates gunshot</i> )

11:57.918 --> 11:59.718
WHAT CAN I TELL YOU?

11:59.720 --> 12:01.986
THAT'S THE WAY I LIKE THEM.

12:01.988 --> 12:03.988
YOUNG, FRESH, BLONDE

12:03.990 --> 12:07.425
WHOLESOME, LIKE THEY
JUST CAME OFF A FARM.

12:07.427 --> 12:09.294
THANK YOU.

12:14.735 --> 12:16.468
(<i> knocking</i> )

12:16.470 --> 12:19.104
JUST A MINUTE.

12:19.106 --> 12:21.206
BE RIGHT THERE.

12:24.277 --> 12:26.344
(<i> knocking</i> )

12:26.346 --> 12:28.146
COMING! COMING!

12:29.983 --> 12:31.983
HERE I AM.

12:31.985 --> 12:34.352
SORRY.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.287
HI, GUY.

12:36.289 --> 12:38.089
HI.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.225
I'M JOLENE.

12:40.227 --> 12:42.994
YOU CAN CALL ME MIKE.

12:42.996 --> 12:45.363
I'LL CALL YOU DAISY
IF YOU WANT

12:45.365 --> 12:47.365
BUT WHAT'S YOUR REAL NAME?

12:47.367 --> 12:50.301
MIKE.

12:53.373 --> 12:57.208
WHERE ARE YOU FROM... MIKE?

12:59.079 --> 13:01.112
UPSTATE.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.515
I SURE HOPE
YOU HAVE A PLANE TICKET.

13:06.453 --> 13:09.854
UH...

13:16.062 --> 13:17.428
YOU KNOW, MIKE

13:17.430 --> 13:21.432
YOU'RE NOT THE KIND OF GUY
WHO WOULD TAKE OFFENSE

13:21.434 --> 13:23.535
IF I ASK YOU
A PERSONAL QUESTION.

13:23.537 --> 13:26.204
NO, NOT AT ALL.

13:26.206 --> 13:29.374
ARE YOU A COP?

13:32.479 --> 13:34.479
NO, WHY?

13:34.481 --> 13:36.281
YOUR SHOES.

13:36.283 --> 13:38.550
BROGANS
AND KNIT SOCKS.

13:39.553 --> 13:43.154
COP SHOES, COP SOCKS.

13:43.156 --> 13:47.125
BUT I'M NOT A COP.

13:55.035 --> 14:00.505
IT'S 220 FOR A HALF HOUR,
250 FOR AN HOUR

14:00.507 --> 14:06.177
AND FOR THAT YOU GET STRAIGHT
OR A HALF-AND-HALF.

14:09.349 --> 14:13.418
WHAT DO YOU SAY
TO THAT, MIKE?

14:13.420 --> 14:16.187
I SAY YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

14:22.596 --> 14:26.364
YOU SAID YOU WEREN'T A COP.

14:26.366 --> 14:29.500
I LIED.

14:29.502 --> 14:32.303
ISN'T THERE SOMETHING ILLEGAL
ABOUT THAT?

14:32.305 --> 14:33.905
WHAT? LYING?

14:33.907 --> 14:35.473
I'M ALLOWED TO LIE.

14:35.475 --> 14:37.175
THEY PAY ME TO LIE.

14:41.348 --> 14:44.616
DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT.

14:44.618 --> 14:47.318
WELL, MAYBE WE CAN
WORK SOMETHING OUT.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.522
LIKE WHAT?

14:51.524 --> 14:54.592
YOU WERE WITH A GUY
NAMED DIAMOND NIGHT BEFORE LAST.

14:54.594 --> 14:55.660
WHAT HAPPENED?

14:55.662 --> 15:00.465
THE NIGHT BEFORE LAST?

15:00.467 --> 15:04.502
I WAS...

15:04.504 --> 15:07.138
UPSTATE.

15:07.140 --> 15:09.340
Logan:
MAX.

15:09.342 --> 15:10.975
HOSPITAL JUST CALLED.

15:10.977 --> 15:12.577
DIAMOND HAD ANOTHER CORONARY.

15:13.947 --> 15:15.313
HE'S DEAD.

15:21.288 --> 15:24.289
I SURE HOPE YOU HAVE
A PLANE TICKET.

15:28.561 --> 15:31.229
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

15:31.231 --> 15:34.232
I DIDN'T REALIZE
HE WAS STILL ALIVE.

15:34.234 --> 15:38.202
I THOUGHT HE WAS DEAD.

15:38.204 --> 15:41.439
I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYONE DIE BEFORE.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.474
JUST TELL US WHAT HAPPENED.

15:46.413 --> 15:48.546
I CALLED MY DRIVER.

15:48.548 --> 15:52.417
HE WAS WAITING FOR ME
IN THE GARAGE.

15:52.419 --> 15:56.187
HE TOLD ME TO SPLIT.

15:56.189 --> 16:00.391
SO, I WENT HOME.

16:00.393 --> 16:03.294
YOU DIDN'T TRY
TO GIVE HIM C.P.R.?

16:03.296 --> 16:05.396
I DIDN'T KNOW
HE WAS STILL ALIVE.

16:05.398 --> 16:07.265
HE WASN'T BREATHING.

16:07.267 --> 16:10.601
I GOT SCARED, OKAY?

16:10.603 --> 16:15.540
I WOULD NEVER JUST LEAVE
SOMEBODY TO DIE.

16:15.542 --> 16:19.444
DO YOU THINK HE WOULD
HAVE BEEN ALL RIGHT?

16:19.446 --> 16:23.281
HOW DID HE GET
TO CENTRAL PARK?

16:23.283 --> 16:25.450
I DON'T KNOW.

16:25.452 --> 16:28.386
YOU'D HAVE TO ASK COOKIE.

16:28.388 --> 16:30.321
COOKIE MOLINA.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.290
THE DRIVER.

16:32.292 --> 16:34.425
WHERE CAN WE FIND HIM?

16:34.427 --> 16:36.561
IN HIS CAR, I GUESS.

16:36.563 --> 16:39.697
HE WORKS OUT
AT THE WEST END GARAGE.

16:44.404 --> 16:47.238
Greevey:
YOU GUYS KNOW A GUY
NAMED COOKIE?

16:47.240 --> 16:49.240
YEAH, HE'S RIGHT
OVER THERE.

16:56.549 --> 16:59.650
YO! COOKIE MOLINA?

16:59.652 --> 17:02.320
WHO WANTS TO KNOW?

17:02.322 --> 17:04.389
HEY, I THOUGHT COOKIE
WAS A GIRL'S NAME.

17:04.391 --> 17:06.691
COME ON,
GET OUT OF THE CAR.

17:06.693 --> 17:09.327
COPS.

17:09.329 --> 17:11.662
SO, TELL US
ABOUT MR. DIAMOND.

17:11.664 --> 17:13.531
NEVER HEARD OF HIM.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.633
HOPE YOU BELONG
TO A SOFTBALL LEAGUE.

17:15.635 --> 17:18.336
HE MUST BE AN ALL-STAR.

17:18.338 --> 17:21.339
HE'S HITTING THE BALL SO HARD
IT BLEEDS.

17:21.341 --> 17:26.210
Logan:
MR. DIAMOND, THEY FOUND
TINY WOODEN SLIVERS IN HIS HEAD.

17:26.212 --> 17:27.712
SOMEBODY HIT HIM WITH SOMETHING.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.213
LIKE A BAT.

17:29.215 --> 17:31.215
COULD HAVE BEEN
THIS BAT.

17:31.217 --> 17:33.217
SINCE YOU DON'T KNOW MR. DIAMOND

17:33.219 --> 17:36.320
WE'LL TAKE IT
AND SEE WHAT TURNS UP.

17:36.322 --> 17:39.223
THE GUY WAS DEAD
BEFORE I HIT HIM.

17:39.225 --> 17:40.725
HEART ATTACK.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.760
Greevey:
WRONG ORDER, COOKIE.

17:42.762 --> 17:47.231
HEART ATTACK, YOU HIT HIM,
THEN HE DIED.

17:47.233 --> 17:49.267
NO WAY. HE WAS HISTORY
IN THE ROOM.

17:49.269 --> 17:51.502
I'M AFRAID THE HOSPITAL
WHERE HE CROAKED

17:51.504 --> 17:54.238
WOULD DISAGREE.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.541
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
TALK IT THROUGH.

17:56.543 --> 17:57.742
BLOW BY BLOW.

17:57.744 --> 18:00.311
JOLENE BEEPS ME.

18:00.313 --> 18:01.712
I GO UP.

18:01.714 --> 18:04.315
JOHN'S LYING THERE.

18:04.317 --> 18:05.616
HE AIN'T MOVING.

18:05.618 --> 18:07.685
HE AIN'T BREATHING.

18:07.687 --> 18:09.520
I CALL JASMINE...

18:09.522 --> 18:11.656
JASMINE?

18:11.658 --> 18:12.757
SHE RUNS THE DAY-TO-DAY.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.492
I TELL HER WE GOT TROUBLE.

18:14.494 --> 18:17.295
SHE PUTS ME ON HOLD,
COMES BACK

18:17.297 --> 18:19.530
AND SAYS,
"DRESS THE GUY."

18:19.532 --> 18:21.165
DIAMOND?

18:21.167 --> 18:22.567
DIAMOND. PRETEND HE'S DRUNK.

18:22.569 --> 18:24.769
TAKE HIM TO THE CAR,
DUMP HIM SOMEPLACE.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.704
MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A MUGGING.

18:26.706 --> 18:29.640
SO, I DRIVE TO THE PARK,
DUMP HIM.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.442
TURN OUT HIS POCKETS

18:31.444 --> 18:34.412
TOSS HIS KEY AND WALLET
INTO THE BUSHES.

18:34.414 --> 18:36.180
THEN YOU HIT HIM.

18:36.182 --> 18:38.349
WHEN I TOLD JASMINE,
SHE FREAKED.

18:38.351 --> 18:40.718
"WHAT YOU DO THAT FOR?"
SHE'S SCREAMING.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.654
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

18:43.656 --> 18:46.390
SHE SAID MAKE IT
LOOK LIKE A MUGGING.

18:46.392 --> 18:47.758
YOU DID A GOOD JOB.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.560
I CAN SEE THE FUTURE.

18:49.562 --> 18:50.795
OH, YEAH?

18:50.797 --> 18:53.798
YOU GUYS ARE GOING
TO READ ME MY RIGHTS.

19:11.618 --> 19:14.218
Woman:
HELLO?

19:14.220 --> 19:16.587
I'M JASMINE.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.723
HELLO.

19:18.725 --> 19:21.259
I BELIEVE YOU ASKED FOR ME?

19:21.261 --> 19:24.262
YEAH.

19:32.205 --> 19:33.738
FIRST TIME?

19:33.740 --> 19:36.474
WHAT?

19:36.476 --> 19:38.309
FIRST TIME HERE?

19:38.311 --> 19:40.611
YEAH.

19:40.613 --> 19:44.549
WELL, RELAX.

19:47.353 --> 19:51.489
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
A GOOD TIME.

19:51.491 --> 19:54.492
DID THEY EXPLAIN
THE RATES DOWNSTAIRS?

19:54.494 --> 19:55.860
NO.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.728
IT'S 250 AN HOUR.

19:57.730 --> 20:00.531
I DON'T DO HALVES

20:00.533 --> 20:04.635
AND I ONLY DO
STRAIGHT SEX.

20:04.637 --> 20:07.772
CONGRATULATIONS.

20:07.774 --> 20:10.908
YOU JUST SAID THE MAGIC WORD.

20:14.614 --> 20:16.314
LOOK AT ME.

20:16.316 --> 20:17.582
I'M OVERWEIGHT.

20:17.584 --> 20:20.318
SUPPOSE I HAD A BAD HEART
LIKE DIAMOND.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.586
DOESN'T THAT BOTHER YOU?

20:21.588 --> 20:22.853
GIVE ME A BREAK.

20:22.855 --> 20:25.590
DOES JACK LaLANNE
ASK FOR A CARDIOGRAM?

20:25.592 --> 20:26.691
JOHNS ARE BIG BOYS.

20:26.693 --> 20:28.359
IF THEY CHOOSE TO GO

20:28.361 --> 20:29.560
TO AN ESCORT SERVICE...

20:29.562 --> 20:30.761
YOU MEAN WHOREHOUSE.

20:30.763 --> 20:33.864
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD
HAVE SENT YOUR PARTNER.

20:33.866 --> 20:36.500
I DON'T USUALLY DO DISCIPLINE

20:36.502 --> 20:39.904
BUT I WOULD LOVE
TO TEACH HIM SOME MANNERS.

20:48.348 --> 20:50.915
IN AND OUT,
JUST LIKE WORK, HUH?

20:50.917 --> 20:53.951
I'M ONLY AS QUICK
AS THE GUY I'M WITH.

20:53.953 --> 20:55.920
YOU LOOK LIKE UNDER A MINUTE.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.688
JOE.

20:57.690 --> 20:59.457
HER LAWYER,
THIS GUY AUCLAIR--

20:59.459 --> 21:02.727
JUST SET A NEW RECORD,
BAIL IN UNDER AN HOUR.

21:02.729 --> 21:03.828
KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT HIM?

21:03.830 --> 21:05.329
DRESSES SHARP.

21:05.331 --> 21:06.864
NEVER SEEN HIM
AROUND BEFORE.

21:06.866 --> 21:08.599
NOT A REGULAR
PROSS-POPPER.

21:08.601 --> 21:09.867
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

21:09.869 --> 21:12.503
OF A HOOKER
WHO'S GOT A LAWYER

21:12.505 --> 21:15.840
WHO SPENDS MORE ON CLOTHES
THAN I MAKE IN A YEAR?

21:15.842 --> 21:17.708
I THINK WHOEVER'S
PAYING HIS BILL

21:17.710 --> 21:19.377
OUGHT TO ADOPT ME.

21:21.714 --> 21:24.348
WHAT'S IT BEEN,
EIGHT HOURS?

21:24.350 --> 21:26.717
I HATE THIS.

21:26.719 --> 21:28.552
WHAT HAVE WE GOT?

21:28.554 --> 21:34.358
WELL, JASMINE'S LAWYER,
ROGER AUCLAIR, ESQUIRE

21:34.360 --> 21:37.361
HAS NEVER HANDLED
A PROSS BUST BEFORE.

21:37.363 --> 21:40.564
IN THE LAST THREE YEARS,
AUCLAIR HANDLED

21:40.566 --> 21:42.867
ONLY 34 CRIMINAL CASES.

21:42.869 --> 21:44.602
NOTHING COMPLICATED.

21:44.604 --> 21:46.737
ALL THE REST CORPORATE STUFF.

21:46.739 --> 21:48.873
FAVORS FOR CORPORATE CLIENTS.

21:48.875 --> 21:51.475
HE'S THE FIRM'S FIXER.

21:53.880 --> 21:57.448
19 DRUG-RELATED CHARGES

21:57.450 --> 22:01.519
SEVEN LARCENY OR SHOPLIFTING,
SIX ASSAULT--

22:01.521 --> 22:05.690
WIFE-BEATING, HUSBAND-BEATING
PET POODLE-BEATING.

22:05.692 --> 22:09.393
MORE DROPPED CHARGES.

22:09.395 --> 22:11.929
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE PACK IT IN

22:11.931 --> 22:14.565
AND CATCH
A COUPLE HOURS' SLEEP?

22:14.567 --> 22:16.834
ROACH COACH IS OPEN.

22:16.836 --> 22:18.803
LET'S GET SOME FRESH COFFEE.

22:20.907 --> 22:23.474
FIVE POSSIBILITIES LEFT, MAX.

22:26.646 --> 22:30.715
MIKE, WE SHOULD HAVE STARTED
AT THE OTHER END OF THE PILE.

22:30.717 --> 22:34.719
FOUR MONTHS AGO, AUCLAIR STARTS
A THEFT OF SERVICES CASE

22:34.721 --> 22:37.688
AGAINST A GUY NAMED
STRINGFELLOW ON BEHALF OF...

22:37.690 --> 22:40.658
POPPY CATERING.

22:40.660 --> 22:43.561
STRINGFELLOW'S WIFE--
SHE WON'T PAY THE BILL.

22:43.563 --> 22:46.430
THIS IS THE PART
OF THE JOB THAT I LIKE.

22:46.432 --> 22:47.765
BEAUTIFUL, MAX.

22:47.767 --> 22:51.068
Woman:
YES, WE ARE BEING SUED
BY POPPY CATERING

22:51.070 --> 22:54.672
BUT, GENTLEMEN,
THEY ARE NOT CATERERS.

22:54.674 --> 22:56.540
THEY ARE WHORES.

22:56.542 --> 22:57.975
WHORES MY HUSBAND USED.

22:57.977 --> 23:00.578
AND CHARGED
ON HIS GOLD CARD.

23:00.580 --> 23:02.680
YES.

23:02.682 --> 23:06.484
BUT I'M SURE
I DON'T NEED TO REMIND YOU

23:06.486 --> 23:10.955
THAT A CONTRACT ENTERED INTO
FOR AN ILLEGAL ACT IS VOID.

23:10.957 --> 23:15.693
IN ANY CASE, I CERTAINLY
DO NOT INTEND TO PAY THIS BILL.

23:15.695 --> 23:17.962
IT'S THE PRINCIPLE
OF THE THING.

23:17.964 --> 23:19.597
WHAT ABOUT THE PUBLICITY?

23:19.599 --> 23:23.567
I HAD A LITTLE RESEARCH DONE.

23:23.569 --> 23:27.071
THE WOMAN WHO IS RUNNING
POPPY CATERING--

23:27.073 --> 23:32.576
THIS WHOREHOUSE-- IS A WINTHROP.

23:32.578 --> 23:34.979
LAURA WINTHROP.

23:34.981 --> 23:36.981
HER MOTHER
IS A MATTHEWS.

23:36.983 --> 23:39.784
I WENT TO SPENCE
WITH HER.

23:39.786 --> 23:43.087
LAURA IS A VERY CAPABLE WOMAN.

23:43.089 --> 23:46.090
SHE HOLDS AN M.B.A.
FROM HARVARD.

23:46.092 --> 23:52.730
IMAGINE, MY HUSBAND PAID
$1,000 FOR FOUR HOURS' SERVICE.

23:52.732 --> 23:58.102
THAT'S ALMOST AS MUCH
AS I'M PAYING MY DIVORCE LAWYER.

24:01.474 --> 24:02.807
YOU GOT EVERYTHING?

24:02.809 --> 24:03.974
YOU ALL SET?

24:03.976 --> 24:05.543
WE GOT A WARRANT.

24:05.545 --> 24:07.511
WHAT ELSE DO WE NEED?

24:07.513 --> 24:09.513
YOU'RE CRANKY
WHEN YOU DON'T SLEEP.

24:09.515 --> 24:11.015
CRANKY? I LOVE THIS.

24:11.017 --> 24:14.752
LET'S GO BUST...

24:14.754 --> 24:16.587
(<i> doorbell ringing</i> )

24:20.126 --> 24:22.726
POLICE,
HERE TO SEE LAURA WINTHROP.

24:22.728 --> 24:24.595
SEARCH WARRANT!

24:24.597 --> 24:26.096
Greevey:
LAURA WINTHROP

24:26.098 --> 24:28.766
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT

24:28.768 --> 24:31.702
AND REFUSE
TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. DO YOU
UNDERSTAND?

24:34.474 --> 24:36.507
HOW DOES
THE DEFENDANT PLEAD?

24:36.509 --> 24:38.075
NOT GUILTY, YOUR HONOR.

24:38.077 --> 24:39.810
YOU ARE REQUESTING BAIL?

24:39.812 --> 24:41.178
Auclair:
WE ARE.

24:41.180 --> 24:43.047
Stone:
MS. WINTHROP IS NOT

24:43.049 --> 24:45.549
A FLIGHT RISK.

24:45.551 --> 24:47.551
HOWEVER, THE DEFENDANT'S
PROSTITUTION RING

24:47.553 --> 24:50.721
IS ONE OF THE LARGEST
UNCOVERED IN RECENT YEARS.

24:50.723 --> 24:52.089
LISTEN UP, ANDREW

24:52.091 --> 24:55.226
AND GET SOME POINTERS.

24:55.228 --> 24:58.762
THIS IS ALLEGED TO BE
AN EFFICIENTLY-RUN BUSINESS.

24:58.764 --> 25:00.197
THOROUGHLY COMPUTERIZED.

25:00.199 --> 25:02.099
THE CLIENT LIST
INCLUDES DOCTORS

25:02.101 --> 25:04.835
DIPLOMATS,
C.E.O.s OF LARGE CORPORATIONS.

25:04.837 --> 25:06.270
Judge:
GET TO THE POINT.

25:06.272 --> 25:09.106
DESPITE THE IMPRESSIVE LIST
OF ASSETS

25:09.108 --> 25:12.743
PROMOTING PROSTITUTION IS STILL
MERELY A CLASS D FELONY.

25:12.745 --> 25:13.944
WE REQUEST BAIL

25:13.946 --> 25:15.546
COMMENSURATE
WITH THE IMPACT

25:15.548 --> 25:17.948
ON THE MORAL FIBER
OF THIS COMMUNITY.

25:17.950 --> 25:18.983
HEAR THAT, ANDREW?

25:18.985 --> 25:20.918
FIBER.

25:20.920 --> 25:22.753
I TOLD YOU

25:22.755 --> 25:24.154
WE ALL NEED FIBER.

25:24.156 --> 25:27.591
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
I REALIZE IT'S LATE

25:27.593 --> 25:31.061
AND ALL OF US
WOULD RATHER BE SOMEWHERE ELSE.

25:31.063 --> 25:34.532
SINCE WE ARE COMPELLED
TO SPEND SOME TIME TOGETHER

25:34.534 --> 25:36.567
PERHAPS WE COULD HAVE
A LITTLE ORDER.

25:36.569 --> 25:39.570
BAIL, $5,000.

25:45.845 --> 25:48.546
Reporter:
WILL THIS AFFECT YOUR CATERING?

25:48.548 --> 25:51.148
YES, AND THEY WEREN'T
EVEN INVITED.

25:51.150 --> 25:52.783
COUNSELOR

25:52.785 --> 25:54.118
YOU'RE TREADING WATER.

25:54.120 --> 25:56.820
MY CLIENT INVESTED
IN THE CATERING BUSINESS.

25:56.822 --> 25:59.557
SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH PROSTITUTION.

25:59.559 --> 26:03.093
THE RECORDS WE GOT
PROVE OTHERWISE.

26:03.095 --> 26:05.863
CIRCUMSTANTIAL, AT BEST.

26:05.865 --> 26:08.232
SEE YOU IN COURT.

26:12.204 --> 26:15.072
IT STINKS.

26:15.074 --> 26:19.043
D.A. AIN'T GOING TO GIVE YOU
A TOTAL WALK.

26:19.045 --> 26:21.045
YOU WANT TO NAIL WINTHROP?

26:21.047 --> 26:24.048
I CAN SING YOU A TOP-TEN HIT

26:24.050 --> 26:27.051
BUT I GOT TO SLIDE
TO A MISDEMEANOR

26:27.053 --> 26:28.319
AND TIME SERVED.

26:29.889 --> 26:31.589
GIVE HIM THE WALK.

26:31.591 --> 26:33.157
IF PEOPLE ONLY KNEW.

26:33.159 --> 26:36.026
YOU KNOW HOW MANY JOHNS' HEADS

26:36.028 --> 26:38.262
THIS JERK HAS PROBABLY
HIT FUNGOS WITH?

26:38.264 --> 26:41.599
I DON'T CARE
IF HE'S THE DAMN SULTAN OF SWAT.

26:41.601 --> 26:43.901
I'M OUT FOR BIGGER FISH, MAX.

26:43.903 --> 26:45.970
HER OPERATION
COULD KILL HUNDREDS.

26:45.972 --> 26:47.871
THE DEAL'S APPROVED.

26:59.318 --> 27:01.218
"MILLION-DOLLAR MADAME.

27:01.220 --> 27:03.954
"BLUE BLOOD BUSTED
IN PROSTITUTION RING.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.356
COPS CALLED HER MADAME."

27:05.358 --> 27:08.192
WHAT DO HER TELEPHONE
RECORDS SAY?

27:08.194 --> 27:10.628
NO CALLS TO OR FROM
THE WHOREHOUSE.

27:10.630 --> 27:11.962
SHE'S SMART.

27:11.964 --> 27:13.397
BUT SLOPPY.

27:13.399 --> 27:17.134
LAST FEBRUARY, THE HEAT WENT OFF
IN THE WHOREHOUSE.

27:17.136 --> 27:19.937
WINTHROP CALLED
THE BUILDING MANAGER.

27:19.939 --> 27:22.172
SHE WAS SNOBBY ON THE PHONE.

27:22.174 --> 27:23.240
Robinette:
WHEN SHE CALLED

27:23.242 --> 27:24.908
SHE IDENTIFIED HERSELF?

27:24.910 --> 27:26.343
Woman:
NOT JUST ON THE PHONE.

27:26.345 --> 27:28.712
SHE CAME IN!

27:28.714 --> 27:31.382
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME DANISH
OR SOME COFFEE?

27:31.384 --> 27:32.916
NO, THANKS.

27:32.918 --> 27:34.218
Woman:
WHAT A SCENE!

27:34.220 --> 27:36.920
PLUMBERS ARE NOT
THE EASIEST THING

27:36.922 --> 27:40.924
TO GET IN NEW YORK CITY
IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER.

27:40.926 --> 27:42.292
IT TAKES TIME.

27:42.294 --> 27:44.261
IT TAKES A LOT OF DOING.

27:44.263 --> 27:47.197
BUT NOT FOR MISS IMPATIENCE, NO.

27:47.199 --> 27:49.967
MAYBE IT'S EASIER
IN HOITY-TOITY CONNECTICUT.

27:49.969 --> 27:51.135
SHE SAID CONNECTICUT?

27:51.137 --> 27:54.004
NO, SHE REMINDS ME
OF MY SISTER-IN-LAW

27:54.006 --> 27:55.272
FROM CONNECTICUT.

27:55.274 --> 27:56.974
IS THIS THE WOMAN?

27:56.976 --> 27:59.143
Woman:
YEAH.

27:59.145 --> 28:02.446
SHE EVEN LOOKS
LIKE MY SISTER-IN LAW.

28:11.924 --> 28:13.223
YOU COPY
THE WHOLE TRICK BOOK?

28:13.225 --> 28:15.359
JUST THE "A" LIST.

28:15.361 --> 28:18.729
15 NAMES,
EACH WORTH OVER 100 MILL.

28:18.731 --> 28:22.166
PHIPPS MACKENZIE,
COLIN METCALF, DAVID HAMILTON

28:22.168 --> 28:24.368
IT READS LIKE
<i>THE SOCIAL REGISTER.</i>

28:24.370 --> 28:28.172
Boy:
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE...

28:28.174 --> 28:31.075
ANYONE AROUND MY BASE IS IT.

28:31.077 --> 28:32.976
I UNDERSTAND YOUR POSITION.

28:32.978 --> 28:37.047
BUT YOU UNDERSTAND
THERE'S NO WAY I COULD TESTIFY.

28:37.049 --> 28:38.382
I UNDERSTAND YOUR POSITION

28:38.384 --> 28:40.417
BUT YOU'LL BE UNDER SUBPOENA.

28:40.419 --> 28:43.787
I DON'T HAVE TO REMIND YOU
THE PENALTY FOR PERJURY.

28:43.789 --> 28:47.224
YOU PUT ME ON THE STAND
AND I'LL MAKE SURE

28:47.226 --> 28:51.295
YOU SPEND THE REST
OF YOUR INSIGNIFICANT CAREER

28:51.297 --> 28:53.330
PROSECUTING JAYWALKERS.

28:53.332 --> 28:55.999
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME,
MR. HAMILTON.

28:59.939 --> 29:02.506
AND I HOPE YOUR GRANDSON
HAS A HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

29:13.486 --> 29:15.018
BEN!

29:21.160 --> 29:23.026
LOOKING FOR A LUNCH DATE?

29:23.028 --> 29:26.029
I DIDN'T KNOW
WE WERE ON FOR LUNCH.

29:26.031 --> 29:28.098
WE'RE NOT.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.166
HELLO, PAUL.

29:29.168 --> 29:31.235
STILL FLACKING FOR THE MAYOR?

29:31.237 --> 29:34.505
THE MAYOR REALLY LOVES
YOUR PARTNER, BEN

29:34.507 --> 29:37.274
ESPECIALLY YOUR WORK
ON PROSTITUTION.

29:37.276 --> 29:39.376
HE THINKS YOU SHOULD HAVE

29:39.378 --> 29:42.279
A BIGGER STAFF,
A BIGGER BUDGET

29:42.281 --> 29:43.781
A TASK FORCE.

29:43.783 --> 29:46.383
SINCE CRACK
HAS BECOME MUCH MORE VISIBLE

29:46.385 --> 29:49.253
A MAJOR TASK FORCE,
A MAJOR EFFORT.

29:49.255 --> 29:51.421
WHAT DO YOU THINK, BEN?

29:51.423 --> 29:53.056
YOU INTERESTED?

29:53.058 --> 29:56.360
I THINK WE OUGHT TO PUT STOCKS,
GUARDED AND HEATED

29:56.362 --> 29:59.029
ALL THE WAY
UP AND DOWN BROADWAY.

29:59.031 --> 30:00.397
ANYONE CONVICTED
FOR CRACK

30:00.399 --> 30:02.032
GOES IN THOSE STOCKS

30:02.034 --> 30:04.134
WEARING A DUNCE CUP

30:04.136 --> 30:05.536
AND CLOWN NOSE.

30:05.538 --> 30:07.404
THAT WOULD SOLVE THE PROBLEM.

30:07.406 --> 30:09.139
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

30:09.141 --> 30:10.574
IF THAT'S THE WAY

30:10.576 --> 30:13.277
YOU WANT TO PLAY IT, BEN.

30:17.249 --> 30:18.482
GENTLEMEN.

30:22.588 --> 30:25.322
MS. WINTHROP'S FRIENDS
ARE GETTING NERVOUS.

30:25.324 --> 30:28.158
THEY'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING
FOR A SCAPEGOAT.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.594
LIKE MAYBE JOLENE AND COOKIE
CONSPIRED TO ROLL DIAMOND?

30:30.596 --> 30:33.564
WE MUST MAKE SURE THAT JOLENE
IS NOT CONNECTED TO COOKIE.

30:33.566 --> 30:35.299
CHECK THE BAT.

30:35.301 --> 30:37.534
MAKE SURE HER PRINTS
AREN'T ON IT.

30:37.536 --> 30:39.837
GET A SAMPLE OF HER BLOOD.

30:39.839 --> 30:42.239
SEE IF THEY MATCH
WITH THE BLOOD

30:42.241 --> 30:43.473
ON COOKIE'S BAT.

30:43.475 --> 30:45.375
ALL THE CLICHÉS ARE TRUE.

30:45.377 --> 30:46.877
SUCH AS?

30:46.879 --> 30:51.548
POLITICS
MAKES STRANGE BEDFELLOWS.

30:56.589 --> 30:58.555
MURDER TWO,
THAT'S ABSURD.

30:58.557 --> 30:59.890
DIAMOND DIED.

30:59.892 --> 31:02.326
YOU CAN'T PROVE
A BLOW TO THE HEAD.

31:02.328 --> 31:04.862
I CAN PROVE RECKLESS DISREGARD
FOR HUMAN LIFE.

31:04.864 --> 31:06.463
BULL!

31:06.465 --> 31:08.432
WELL, LET'S SEE WHAT
THE JURY HAS TO SAY.

31:08.434 --> 31:09.566
COUNSELOR.

31:11.503 --> 31:14.404
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

31:14.406 --> 31:17.641
SHE'LL PLEAD
TO PROMOTING PROSTITUTION.

31:17.643 --> 31:20.277
I WANT HER TO DO TIME.

31:20.279 --> 31:22.512
WHAT ARE YOU,
A RELIGIOUS FANATIC?

31:22.514 --> 31:24.381
AND MORE THAN ONE YEAR.

31:24.383 --> 31:27.184
I WANT PRISON, NOT JAIL.

31:37.463 --> 31:39.630
AUCLAIR WANTS
TO MAKE A DEAL.

31:39.632 --> 31:41.531
THAT THE LAB REPORT?

31:41.533 --> 31:44.234
THE WOOD FOUND IN DIAMOND'S HEAD
MATCHES...

31:44.236 --> 31:45.269
COOKIE'S BAT.

31:45.271 --> 31:46.270
THE BLOOD TYPE...

31:46.272 --> 31:46.970
MATCH DIAMOND'S.

31:46.972 --> 31:48.272
SOME OF IT.

31:48.274 --> 31:49.373
THERE ARE OTHER TYPES.

31:49.375 --> 31:50.641
SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

31:50.643 --> 31:55.178
ALL THE LAB REPORTS CAME IN,
INCLUDING JOLENE'S.

31:55.180 --> 31:57.247
HER BLOOD WAS ON THE BAT?

31:57.249 --> 31:59.950
NO, IT WASN'T THAT.

31:59.952 --> 32:03.553
THERE'S A NEW BLIND SCREENING
PROGRAM FOR H.I.V.

32:03.555 --> 32:05.656
SHE'S GOT AIDS?

32:09.628 --> 32:12.529
MAKES HER A HELL
OF A COMPELLING WITNESS.

32:12.531 --> 32:15.532
THE PUBLIC HEALTH ANGLE
IS EXPLOSIVE.

32:17.403 --> 32:21.271
ACTUALLY, I'M GLAD YOU CALLED,
MR. STONE.

32:21.273 --> 32:23.607
I'VE DECIDED
NOT TO TESTIFY.

32:23.609 --> 32:26.343
I'LL PLEAD
TO THE PROSTITUTION CHARGE.

32:26.345 --> 32:29.513
I'M SORRY. I REALLY AM.

32:29.515 --> 32:32.382
I KNOW YOU WERE COUNTING
ON MY TESTIMONY

32:32.384 --> 32:34.952
BUT LAURA WINTHROP'S
BEEN GOOD TO ME.

32:34.954 --> 32:36.453
THAT'S NOT WHY WE'RE HERE.

32:39.191 --> 32:41.258
IT'S NOT?

32:42.728 --> 32:44.695
WHY?

32:46.565 --> 32:49.366
THE BLOOD SAMPLE
THAT WAS TAKEN...

32:49.368 --> 32:53.437
IT BECAME PART OF A BLIND TEST.

32:58.177 --> 33:02.045
WHAT KIND OF TEST?

33:07.386 --> 33:09.386
AN AIDS TEST?

33:09.388 --> 33:12.322
THEY DID AN H.I.V. TEST?

33:12.324 --> 33:14.691
YES.

33:17.563 --> 33:19.396
NO.

33:19.398 --> 33:21.631
NO, I WAS TESTED...

33:21.633 --> 33:24.401
TWO MONTHS AGO.

33:24.403 --> 33:27.537
ALL POSITIVES
ARE DOUBLE-CHECKED.

33:45.357 --> 33:47.424
HEALTH FOOD.

33:52.564 --> 33:55.098
WE GOT HER NAILED
ON PROSTITUTION.

33:55.100 --> 33:59.202
THE OTHER CHARGES ARE GOING
TO PUT HER BEHIND BARS.

33:59.204 --> 34:00.704
MY DAD USED TO SAY

34:00.706 --> 34:03.440
UNLESS YOU'RE HOLDING
A FULL HOUSE

34:03.442 --> 34:05.142
CALL, DON'T RAISE.

34:05.144 --> 34:06.743
HE WAS
A PHILOSOPHER.

34:06.745 --> 34:10.047
WITH JOLENE AND COOKIE,
I'M STILL IN THE GAME.

34:10.049 --> 34:11.615
SOUNDS LIKE A LOW PAIR.

34:15.454 --> 34:18.121
YOUR WIFE HAS BEEN AN INVALID
FOR 14 YEARS.

34:18.123 --> 34:19.089
IS THAT CORRECT?

34:19.091 --> 34:20.090
YES.

34:20.092 --> 34:21.158
DURING THAT TIME

34:21.160 --> 34:22.692
HAVE YOU HAD OCCASION

34:22.694 --> 34:24.828
TO USE THE SERVICES
OF PROSTITUTES?

34:24.830 --> 34:26.663
YES.

34:26.665 --> 34:28.465
HOW MANY?

34:28.467 --> 34:29.766
MAYBE 2,000.

34:32.638 --> 34:34.771
EVER USE THE SAME WOMAN TWICE?

34:34.773 --> 34:36.573
NOT OFTEN.

34:36.575 --> 34:40.143
MOST OF THE GIRLS WEREN'T WORTH
USING ONCE, LET ALONE TWICE.

34:40.145 --> 34:43.847
(<i> laughter</i> )

34:43.849 --> 34:45.849
WHAT ABOUT JOLENE CURTIS?

34:45.851 --> 34:47.684
JOLENE...

34:47.686 --> 34:50.420
I USED HER
WHENEVER SHE WAS AVAILABLE.

34:50.422 --> 34:53.457
SHE'S VERY, VERY GOOD
AT WHAT SHE DOES.

34:53.459 --> 34:56.493
WHAT DOES SHE DO?

34:56.495 --> 34:58.862
OH, SHE GETS YOU
VERY, VERY EXCITED.

34:58.864 --> 35:02.599
WHATEVER SHE DOES,
IS IT HARD ON THE HEART?

35:02.601 --> 35:07.137
SHE'S HARD ON EVERYTHING.

35:07.139 --> 35:08.872
(<i> laughter</i> )

35:11.810 --> 35:16.680
Stone:
MR. HAMILTON, CAN YOU TELL ME
ABOUT THE WHIPPING INCIDENT?

35:16.682 --> 35:20.250
WHAT I DID
AT MISS WINTHROP'S ESTABLISHMENT

35:20.252 --> 35:23.286
DIDN'T EXACTLY INVOLVE
ANY WHIPPING.

35:23.288 --> 35:25.122
WASN'T A WHIP
IN THE ROOM?

35:30.496 --> 35:33.263
WAS ANYONE
HOLDING THE WHIP?

35:34.867 --> 35:36.900
(<i> mumbling</i> )

35:36.902 --> 35:38.168
I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

35:38.170 --> 35:39.669
PLEASE SPEAK UP.

35:39.671 --> 35:43.507
THE YOUNG WOMAN

35:43.509 --> 35:47.511
WAS HOLDING THE WHIP.

35:47.513 --> 35:49.312
I DON'T RECALL HER NAME.

35:50.582 --> 35:52.582
YOUR WITNESS.

36:00.826 --> 36:05.862
I KNOW HOW AWKWARD,
HOW EMBARRASSING

36:05.864 --> 36:08.865
THIS SITUATION
MUST BE FOR YOU.

36:08.867 --> 36:13.603
I WONDER IF YOU WOULD MIND
ELABORATING ON YOUR VISIT

36:13.605 --> 36:18.208
TO MISS WINTHROP'S SERVICE.

36:18.210 --> 36:22.279
WITH THE YOUNG WOMAN,
ABOUT THE WHIP?

36:22.281 --> 36:24.948
SHE ONLY USED IT
TO DRESS UP.

36:26.885 --> 36:30.921
PLAYING... MAKE BELIEVE?

36:30.923 --> 36:32.622
YES.

36:32.624 --> 36:34.758
Auclair:
HELPING TO ALLEVIATE

36:34.760 --> 36:38.328
THE PERFECTLY
UNDERSTANDABLE<i> ENNUI</i>

36:38.330 --> 36:41.364
THAT COMES AFTER SO MANY YEARS
OF MARRIAGE.

36:41.366 --> 36:42.899
THEY'RE BUYING IT.

36:42.901 --> 36:44.768
YUP.

36:44.770 --> 36:46.903
Cookie:
JASMINE CHECKED WITH WINTHROP

36:46.905 --> 36:49.673
WHEN THERE WERE PROBLEMS
WITH CLIENTS.

36:49.675 --> 36:51.908
WERE THE CLIENTS
GENERALLY HEALTHY?

36:51.910 --> 36:53.643
THE SERVICE
HAD CLIENTS

36:53.645 --> 36:55.912
WHO WEREN'T
IN THE BEST OF HEALTH.

36:55.914 --> 36:57.380
MEN WITH BAD HEARTS

36:57.382 --> 36:58.815
LIKE MR. DIAMOND?

36:58.817 --> 37:01.284
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT HIS HEART.

37:01.286 --> 37:04.821
DID ANY OTHER OF HER CLIENTS
HAVE BAD HEARTS?

37:04.823 --> 37:06.590
LOOK, THEIR HEARTS--

37:06.592 --> 37:09.593
THAT'S NOT THE PART
OF THEIR ANATOMY

37:09.595 --> 37:12.229
THE GIRLS
WERE MOST INVOLVED WITH.

37:14.633 --> 37:16.566
ANSWER THE QUESTION.

37:16.568 --> 37:18.702
A LOT OF THE GUYS I DRIVE--

37:18.704 --> 37:21.838
I HEARD THEM COMPLAINING
TO THE GIRLS

37:21.840 --> 37:24.274
ABOUT THEIR WIVES,
THEIR WORK.

37:24.276 --> 37:26.276
THEY WERE A TENSE BREED.

37:26.278 --> 37:27.877
WORKAHOLICS.

37:27.879 --> 37:31.748
WHAT WAS MISS WINTHROP'S
ATTITUDE TOWARD THEM?

37:31.750 --> 37:33.883
I NEVER MET MISS WINTHROP.

37:33.885 --> 37:36.953
BUT YOU MUST HAVE OVERHEARD
SOME CONVERSATION

37:36.955 --> 37:38.388
SHE HAD ABOUT THEM.

37:38.390 --> 37:39.823
YEAH, WITH JASMINE.

37:39.825 --> 37:41.958
THEY WERE IN A COFFEE SHOP.

37:41.960 --> 37:43.693
THEY DIDN'T SEE ME.

37:43.695 --> 37:46.830
THEY WERE JOKING
ABOUT THE HARD-DRIVING JOHNS.

37:46.832 --> 37:48.832
AND WHAT WAS
HER ATTITUDE?

37:48.834 --> 37:52.702
OBJECTION. SUPPOSITION
ON THE PART OF THE WITNESS.

37:52.704 --> 37:53.837
HE HAS NO IDEA

37:53.839 --> 37:56.306
WHAT MISS WINTHROP
HAD IN MIND.

37:56.308 --> 37:58.341
I'LL REPHRASE
THE QUESTION.

37:58.343 --> 37:59.643
CAN YOU TELL ME

37:59.645 --> 38:01.678
EXACTLY WHAT
MISS WINTHROP SAID?

38:01.680 --> 38:04.614
OH, YEAH. IT STUCK IN MY MIND.

38:04.616 --> 38:06.750
SHE SAID, "A DEUCE"--

38:06.752 --> 38:08.018
THAT'S TWO HOURS--

38:08.020 --> 38:10.754
"WILL EITHER KILL THEM
OR CURE THEM.

38:10.756 --> 38:13.990
"I DON'T CARE WHICH,
AS LONG AS THEIR GOLD CARDS

38:13.992 --> 38:15.325
ARE STILL GOOD."

38:15.327 --> 38:16.793
YOUR HONOR, THIS MAN

38:16.795 --> 38:18.361
IS DESPICABLE.

38:18.363 --> 38:20.930
HE'S MADE A DEAL TO WALK.

38:20.932 --> 38:21.998
BUT IT DIDN'T

38:22.000 --> 38:23.767
AFFECT MY MEMORY.

38:29.308 --> 38:31.341
I HEAR YOU'RE IN TROUBLE.

38:31.343 --> 38:32.842
CHECK YOUR SOURCES.

38:32.844 --> 38:34.844
MOLINA GAVE US

38:34.846 --> 38:36.880
AN EARLY
CHRISTMAS PRESENT.

38:36.882 --> 38:39.416
WHAT WAS AUCLAIR'S REACTION?

38:39.418 --> 38:41.751
STILL WANTS TO MAKE A DEAL.

38:41.753 --> 38:44.954
YEAH, WELL, YOU WANT MY ADVICE?

38:44.956 --> 38:46.656
MAKE THE DEAL.

38:46.658 --> 38:50.360
YOU CAN'T PROVE
WINTHROP GAVE THE ORDER.

38:50.362 --> 38:51.695
WHY NOT?

38:51.697 --> 38:55.899
WHAT MAKES THIS CASE
SO IMPORTANT?

38:55.901 --> 38:58.835
ADAM, YOU GOT ME WRONG.

38:58.837 --> 39:01.438
WILL YOU MAKE A DEAL
WITH AUCLAIR?

39:01.440 --> 39:04.007
NO. I MEAN
THEY'RE ALL IMPORTANT.

39:04.009 --> 39:08.078
YOU KNOW, IT'S GOING
TO BE VERY BAD IF SHE WALKS.

39:08.080 --> 39:11.047
SHE WON'T WALK.

39:11.049 --> 39:13.083
Stone:
AS A MEMBER OF HEALTH BOARD

39:13.085 --> 39:15.952
YOU WORKED ON THE MAYOR'S
<i>AIDS WHITE PAPER.</i>

39:15.954 --> 39:17.420
I DID.

39:17.422 --> 39:21.124
HOW MANY PROSTITUTES
WERE PRESUMED H.I.V.-POSITIVE?

39:21.126 --> 39:23.760
FROM 70-85%.

39:23.762 --> 39:26.029
IT'S DIFFICULT
TO BE MORE PRECISE

39:26.031 --> 39:27.497
BECAUSE THE VIRUS'S

39:27.499 --> 39:31.401
INCUBATION TIME RANGES
FROM MONTHS UP TO TEN YEARS.

39:31.403 --> 39:33.002
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

39:33.004 --> 39:37.073
I ONLY JUST FOUND OUT
I'VE GOT THE AIDS VIRUS.

39:37.075 --> 39:41.411
Stone:
HOW MANY MEN DID YOU
HAVE SEXUAL INTERCOURSE WITH

39:41.413 --> 39:45.382
IN THE 18 MONTHS YOU WORKED
FOR MISS LAURA WINTHROP?

39:45.384 --> 39:47.884
EIGHT HUNDRED...

39:47.886 --> 39:50.453
MAYBE 1,000.

39:50.455 --> 39:52.088
AM I MISSING SOMETHING?

39:52.090 --> 39:53.056
SHE'S<i> OUR</i> WITNESS.

39:53.058 --> 39:54.557
WATCH.

39:54.559 --> 39:56.559
AND DURING THOSE 18 MONTHS

39:56.561 --> 39:59.095
YOU WORKED SOLELY
FOR MISS WINTHROP?

39:59.097 --> 40:01.030
YES.

40:01.032 --> 40:02.766
YOUR WITNESS.

40:06.838 --> 40:10.006
MISS CURTIS, I'M SURE
THAT YOU'RE AWARE

40:10.008 --> 40:15.912
THE INCUBATION PERIOD FOR H.I.V.
CAN BE UP TO TEN YEARS.

40:15.914 --> 40:18.515
YES.

40:18.517 --> 40:20.884
MISS CURTIS, WERE YOU A VIRGIN

40:20.886 --> 40:23.119
BEFORE YOU BEGAN
YOUR ASSOCIATION

40:23.121 --> 40:24.954
WITH POPPY ESCORTS?

40:24.956 --> 40:29.025
MMM... I...

40:29.027 --> 40:34.764
A SIMPLE "YES" OR "NO"
WILL SUFFICE.

40:34.766 --> 40:36.499
NO.

40:36.501 --> 40:38.168
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.

40:38.170 --> 40:40.036
REDIRECT, YOUR HONOR.

40:40.038 --> 40:42.071
Judge:
GO AHEAD, MR. STONE.

40:42.073 --> 40:45.008
JOLENE...

40:45.010 --> 40:47.844
BEFORE YOU WENT TO WORK
FOR MISS WINTHROP

40:47.846 --> 40:51.481
HOW MANY MEN
HAD YOU SLEPT WITH?

40:51.483 --> 40:53.950
THREE.

40:53.952 --> 40:57.220
AND TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE,
ARE THEY ALL HEALTHY?

41:02.194 --> 41:04.594
THEY'RE VERY HEALTHY.

41:04.596 --> 41:07.597
THE PROSECUTION RESTS,
YOUR HONOR.

41:09.034 --> 41:12.469
DO YOU CARE ABOUT THE HEALTH
OF YOUR EMPLOYEES?

41:12.471 --> 41:13.570
I'M QUITE CONCERNED

41:13.572 --> 41:15.104
ABOUT THEIR HEALTH.

41:15.106 --> 41:17.106
ALONG WITH REGULAR CHECKUPS

41:17.108 --> 41:19.976
I INSIST THEY CARRY
MEDICAL INSURANCE.

41:19.978 --> 41:22.979
AND YOU URGE THEM
TO SEEK PSYCHOTHERAPY?

41:22.981 --> 41:25.114
YES, THAT'S ONE
OF THE REASONS

41:25.116 --> 41:27.183
THEY CARRY
MEDICAL INSURANCE.

41:27.185 --> 41:28.651
IT PAYS
FOR THE THERAPY.

41:28.653 --> 41:30.119
WE<i> DO</i> ENCOURAGE IT.

41:30.121 --> 41:32.655
THANK YOU.

41:32.657 --> 41:34.924
YOUR WITNESS, SIR.

41:34.926 --> 41:37.660
THIS INSISTENCE
ON HEALTH INSURANCE

41:37.662 --> 41:39.829
AND MEDICAL CHECKUPS--

41:39.831 --> 41:42.065
DO YOU DO THIS
OUT OF ALTRUISM?

41:42.067 --> 41:44.934
LET'S SAY,
ENLIGHTENED SELF-INTEREST.

41:44.936 --> 41:47.537
IF MY MALE GUESTS
PICKED UP A BUG...

41:47.539 --> 41:48.605
MISS WINTHROP

41:48.607 --> 41:50.673
DO YOU CONSIDER AIDS A BUG?

41:50.675 --> 41:53.109
AIDS IS A VERY SERIOUS DISEASE.

41:53.111 --> 41:56.880
I DON'T WANT ANYONE
IN MY LITTLE FAMILY INFECTED.

41:56.882 --> 41:58.882
YOU SCREEN
PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYEES

41:58.884 --> 42:00.683
AND IF THEY TESTED POSITIVE...

42:00.685 --> 42:02.085
I WOULDN'T
HIRE HER.

42:02.087 --> 42:04.954
THEY WOULDN'T BE PART
OF YOUR LITTLE FAMILY?

42:04.956 --> 42:06.189
MY LITTLE FAMILY

42:06.191 --> 42:09.893
WAS THE BEST FINISHING SCHOOL
ON THE EAST COAST.

42:09.895 --> 42:11.160
GIRLS CAME TO ME

42:11.162 --> 42:14.631
WITHOUT EDUCATION, WITHOUT WIT,
WITHOUT CLASS.

42:14.633 --> 42:16.699
I TAUGHT THEM HOW TO SPEAK

42:16.701 --> 42:19.102
HOW TO DRESS,
AND AFTER A YEAR

42:19.104 --> 42:22.705
THESE NAIVE YOUNG WOMEN
LEARNED SOPHISTICATION.

42:22.707 --> 42:25.909
AND FOR THAT, MISS WINTHROP,
SHAME ON YOU.

42:25.911 --> 42:28.912
YOU ACT AS THOUGH
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THEM.

42:28.914 --> 42:30.580
LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT.

42:30.582 --> 42:33.116
HAVE YOU EVER HELPED
ANY OF THESE GIRLS

42:33.118 --> 42:35.118
LIKE THE ONES YOU DIDN'T HIRE?

42:35.120 --> 42:36.953
NO.

42:36.955 --> 42:39.188
IF THEY TESTED POSITIVE
FOR AIDS...

42:39.190 --> 42:41.591
THEY WOULD STOP WORKING
FOR ME.

42:41.593 --> 42:43.326
AND IN THE PAST
THREE YEARS

42:43.328 --> 42:45.995
HOW MANY OF YOUR
LONG-TERM EMPLOYEES

42:45.997 --> 42:47.730
STOPPED WORKING FOR YOU

42:47.732 --> 42:50.199
BECAUSE THEY TESTED POSITIVE
FOR AIDS?

42:51.303 --> 42:54.003
I'D SAY ABOUT A DOZEN.

42:54.005 --> 42:56.205
HAVE YOU TRIED TO HELP
ANY OF THEM?

42:57.609 --> 42:59.242
NO.

42:59.244 --> 43:02.712
HAVE YOU VISITED
ANY OF THEM?

43:02.714 --> 43:03.980
HAVE YOU?

43:05.116 --> 43:07.116
NO.

43:07.118 --> 43:10.286
DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THEM?

43:10.288 --> 43:12.021
TRIED TO FIND OUT?

43:13.592 --> 43:15.625
NO.

43:15.627 --> 43:19.362
I'VE NEVER TRIED TO FIND OUT.

43:19.364 --> 43:22.632
HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU MAKE
IN ONE YEAR?

43:22.634 --> 43:24.000
IN THIS PAST YEAR?

43:24.002 --> 43:25.368
YEAH.

43:25.370 --> 43:27.036
I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

43:27.038 --> 43:29.138
100,000?

43:29.140 --> 43:30.273
PROBABLY.

43:30.275 --> 43:31.240
ONE MILLION?

43:31.242 --> 43:33.009
I DON'T THINK SO.

43:33.011 --> 43:36.746
OH, I DO THINK YOU DO THINK SO.

43:36.748 --> 43:40.149
I THINK THAT
YOU MADE $1,672,000.

43:43.188 --> 43:45.188
THAT'S WHAT YOU STATED

43:45.190 --> 43:49.626
ON YOUR NEW YORK STATE
INCOME TAX RETURN.

43:49.628 --> 43:52.028
AND WITH ALL THAT MONEY

43:52.030 --> 43:54.397
YOU DIDN'T HELP
THESE GIRLS ONCE.

43:54.399 --> 43:57.066
AND AS FOR YOUR CUSTOMERS--

43:57.068 --> 43:59.969
MISS WINTHROP,
HAVE YOU EVER TRIED

43:59.971 --> 44:02.672
TO CONTACT CUSTOMERS
AND WARN THEM

44:02.674 --> 44:06.776
THAT THEY HAD SLEPT WITH WOMEN
WHO ARE H.I.V.-POSITIVE?

44:14.352 --> 44:16.319
(<i> softly:</i> )
NO.

44:16.321 --> 44:18.655
MISS WINTHROP, I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

44:18.657 --> 44:20.156
WOULD YOU PLEASE SPEAK UP.

44:20.158 --> 44:22.258
NO.

44:22.260 --> 44:23.693
ISN'T IT TRUE

44:23.695 --> 44:26.062
THAT YOU ARE CREATING
AN ATMOSPHERE

44:26.064 --> 44:28.031
OF DISREGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE

44:28.033 --> 44:30.366
WHICH MUST LEAD
TO SOMEONE'S DEATH

44:30.368 --> 44:33.770
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER?

44:41.713 --> 44:44.714
ALL RIGHT, STONE,
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

44:44.716 --> 44:46.049
MAKE ME AN OFFER.

44:46.051 --> 44:48.418
Winthrop:
LET'S HEAR MR. STONE'S THOUGHTS

44:48.420 --> 44:50.253
ON THE MATTER FIRST.

44:50.255 --> 44:54.323
IT MIGHT BE MORE APPROPRIATE
TO LET YOUR LAWYER HANDLE THIS.

44:54.325 --> 44:55.458
IF YOU DON'T MIND

44:55.460 --> 44:57.794
I FIND THIS
QUITE FASCINATING.

45:04.202 --> 45:06.869
HOW ABOUT
INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER?

45:06.871 --> 45:09.205
I CAN BE OUT
IN FIVE YEARS, RIGHT?

45:09.207 --> 45:10.273
TWO AND A HALF

45:10.275 --> 45:12.241
WITH GOOD BEHAVIOR.

45:12.243 --> 45:15.211
I'M ALWAYS
ON MY BEST BEHAVIOR, MR. STONE.

45:19.451 --> 45:21.718
IT'S A DEAL.

45:35.133 --> 45:36.799
Woman:
EXCUSE ME, MISS.

45:36.801 --> 45:40.336
CAN WE GET A COMMENT FROM YOU
ON THE WINTHROP CASE?

45:40.338 --> 45:42.238
YOU WERE THE FOREMAN
OF THE JURY.

45:42.240 --> 45:43.740
COULD YOU TELL

45:43.742 --> 45:46.209
WHAT THE VERDICT
WOULD HAVE BEEN?

45:46.211 --> 45:48.478
I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE OTHERS.

45:48.480 --> 45:51.080
SHE SEEMED
LIKE SUCH A NICE GIRL

45:51.082 --> 45:52.348
A REAL LADY.

45:52.350 --> 45:56.085
STILL, I PROBABLY
WOULD HAVE VOTED TO CONVICT.

45:56.087 --> 45:58.154
THANK YOU.

45:58.156 --> 46:01.190
Robinette:
MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
DONE A DEAL.

46:01.192 --> 46:03.359
MAYBE.

46:03.361 --> 46:06.395
BUT IT AIN'T BAD
FOR A PAIR OF TREYS.
