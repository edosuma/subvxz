00:02.620 --> 00:06.340
Did you hear William beat up someone from Hansen this weekend?

00:07.300 --> 00:11.620
You're going on a date with William...
for Vilde's sake?

00:12.340 --> 00:18.080
It was good that you apologised to Vilde.

00:18.320 --> 00:20.460
About her not being good enough for you.

00:20.680 --> 00:22.700
I hope it was a smart plan.

00:23.740 --> 00:25.780
Because now she's keen on me again.

00:27.060 --> 00:28.780
I'm not keen on her.

00:29.320 --> 00:30.300
Where are you?

00:31.520 --> 00:32.360
We have to go.

00:58.960 --> 00:59.740
Eva?

01:03.860 --> 01:04.900
Eva!

01:12.340 --> 01:13.780
Noora!

01:14.640 --> 01:15.280
Hi.

01:15.880 --> 01:17.080
Hi.

01:19.260 --> 01:20.540
I slept here.

01:23.300 --> 01:24.640
I can see, you know.

01:30.420 --> 01:31.280
Who is he?

01:33.200 --> 01:36.500
His name is Håvard.
-Halvor.

01:41.880 --> 01:43.440
How was your date yesterday?

01:52.000 --> 01:53.460
Eh... fine.

01:54.460 --> 01:55.700
How was he?

01:57.620 --> 01:58.600
Nice.

01:58.700 --> 02:00.840
Nice? You have to tell me more!

02:01.360 --> 02:05.960
Good morning!
-Hey birthday boy!

02:08.520 --> 02:09.620
You know what?

02:10.440 --> 02:12.500
I think I'm still drunk. A little.

02:14.840 --> 02:16.780
Could you be a little bit more quiet?

02:19.540 --> 02:27.240
Okay, Linn!
We'll be quiet all day!

02:28.200 --> 02:29.440
I need some water.

02:43.100 --> 02:44.020
Eskild!

02:45.220 --> 02:47.080
What did you say to Eva?

02:48.640 --> 02:49.760
I didn't say anything.

02:52.380 --> 02:55.220
I said you'd gone on a Tinder date with a guy.

02:56.800 --> 02:58.020
Tinder?!

02:58.600 --> 03:01.180
Hello, what world do you live in?

03:01.300 --> 03:06.020
I had to say something about why you
weren't out celebrating my birthday with me.

03:06.120 --> 03:08.240
Eskild, it wasn't your birthday.

03:08.740 --> 03:13.820
You can't just hang out with my friends
when I'm not here.

03:14.420 --> 03:18.700
We chatted a little on Facebook.
She said she wanted to party.

03:18.800 --> 03:20.740
I wanted to party too, so...

03:23.680 --> 03:25.360
Eskild, you...

03:26.500 --> 03:31.520
Are you jealous? Jealous that I'm taking all your friends?

03:32.740 --> 03:34.480
Because I'm popular? Because I'm hot?

03:34.680 --> 03:35.620
Because...

03:37.260 --> 03:41.020
I won't take your place in your friends gang.
-I'm trying to be serious!

03:41.120 --> 03:45.820
You are hugely popular and so funny!
Pretty! Smart! Good!

03:46.860 --> 03:50.360
Do you need a hug?
-No! I don't need a hug.

03:54.100 --> 03:55.080
Bear hug.

03:58.240 --> 04:01.840
Is it better now?
Do you want a hug?

04:02.460 --> 04:04.440
You... Are you okay now?

04:05.180 --> 04:08.200
Just take me seriously!
-Yes, I am taking you seriously!

04:10.240 --> 04:13.300
The Yakuza-boys were like:
Hey, guys! Stop, you're killing him!

04:13.301 --> 04:14.980
(Yakuza-boys = a different Russ bus group)

04:15.980 --> 04:20.320
He sat on top and hit and hit him, but he screamed:
Haven't you had enough now?!

04:22.400 --> 04:26.960
He just lay there and wasn't even able to respond.
He just spit up blood.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.960
Did you see the video?

04:30.580 --> 04:33.520
It was so rough!

04:33.660 --> 04:36.580
The Yakuza-guys fought with a knife.

04:40.780 --> 04:45.000
... he found his mother dead in the bathtub.
After that something snapped in him.

04:48.700 --> 04:54.220
.. and so I wrote to him: Heard there was a fight on Friday.
Are you okay?

04:54.360 --> 04:58.420
He didn't answer.
I was terribly worried.

04:58.680 --> 05:00.860
I heard that he wasn't even there.

05:02.420 --> 05:03.700
Who did you hear that from?

05:03.800 --> 05:10.880
I was talking to Iben, and he told me it was only
Chris and a few others who were there.

05:11.040 --> 05:13.060
That's why it was really unfair.

05:13.180 --> 05:16.720
Because there were 20 Yakuza-boys.

05:17.260 --> 05:20.900
They were looking for William, but William wasn't there.

05:20.900 --> 05:22.540
So they were beaten up..

05:22.780 --> 05:27.020
.. while William was at home fucking some girl.

05:27.860 --> 05:29.220
What girl?

05:31.300 --> 05:34.980
It's just a rumor.
I don't know if it's true.

05:35.420 --> 05:37.140
Did William reply?

05:37.260 --> 05:40.140
No, he didn't reply. So I sent:

05:40.340 --> 05:45.660
"William, could you answer, so I know you're alive?
I'm terribly worried."

05:45.800 --> 05:49.760
Then he replied at 11.33: "Alive. I'm alive."

05:51.580 --> 05:53.120
Has anyone seen them?

05:53.340 --> 05:57.100
Chris is definitely still at the hospital.

05:58.840 --> 06:00.480
Isn't that William's car?

06:51.720 --> 06:54.680
Did Iben say more about the girl William was with?

06:59.280 --> 07:03.260
It could be Olivia from the third year.

07:04.040 --> 07:07.060
Or Marte from 1STA.

07:08.760 --> 07:10.540
No, she's a bit strange.

07:11.800 --> 07:15.400
What's the name of the girl that came out of the cafeteria?

07:17.980 --> 07:19.400
She's quite pretty.

07:20.520 --> 07:24.280
Or maybe the dark girl? Isabel?

07:24.520 --> 07:26.280
Wasn't she with Jonas..

07:26.280 --> 07:27.360
Hey!

07:28.580 --> 07:34.900
It could be Anja from 2STB,
but she isn't really his type.

07:35.000 --> 07:38.300
She is a bit... thick.

07:38.420 --> 07:39.340
Huh?

07:39.460 --> 07:41.340
You have to stop now. She's fat?!

07:41.480 --> 07:45.480
Not fat-fat. I'm just saying William likes skinny girls.

07:46.360 --> 07:48.360
That's the dumbest thing I've heard, Vilde.

07:49.680 --> 07:53.440
I'm just saying that boys like different things.

07:53.680 --> 07:56.220
Some like small butts, others like big ones.

07:56.660 --> 08:02.820
Not everyone has to be super skinny,
but William likes girls who are model thin.

08:03.640 --> 08:04.860
Like you.

08:07.520 --> 08:13.460
If it's true that William's dating a girl,
she's definitely really skinny.

08:13.700 --> 08:17.400
It's not to diss Anja.
Gum?

08:32.560 --> 08:35.020
I'm going to find out who it is on Friday.

08:38.240 --> 08:39.660
Friday?

08:42.440 --> 08:47.260
If William's actually dating someone, she's definitely coming to his party.

08:50.920 --> 08:52.740
Party?

08:52.860 --> 08:55.040
Oh yeah! We can't drink at my place.

08:55.300 --> 08:56.800
Mom's coming home.

08:57.500 --> 08:58.980
Can we do it at your place?

09:00.500 --> 09:03.460
Eh, yeah. But I won't be at William's party.

09:03.780 --> 09:04.960
Why not?

09:06.400 --> 09:08.920
Because I can't on Friday.

09:11.160 --> 09:14.980
You never want to go out anymore.

09:15.040 --> 09:17.060
You didn't go out last weekend, either.

09:19.140 --> 09:21.460
There was no one who could go out last weekend.

09:25.940 --> 09:27.760
Is there someone you're hiding from us?

09:28.940 --> 09:32.860
A little girlfriend, maybe?

09:35.380 --> 09:38.140
Bring her to William's party.

09:38.560 --> 09:42.200
Seriously? I can? That's so amazing, Vilde!

09:42.260 --> 09:46.900
Maybe she can come to the cabin?
A lesbian couple in Hemsedal.

09:46.960 --> 09:48.520
That would be so cozy!

09:49.360 --> 09:50.540
Right, Eva?

09:51.820 --> 09:53.120
Yeah!

09:54.460 --> 09:56.300
What do you have now?

09:56.460 --> 09:57.300
Chemistry.

09:57.480 --> 09:59.320
I have class in the B-building, so.

10:01.380 --> 10:02.660
Bye!

10:08.220 --> 10:09.540
Vilde...

10:13.380 --> 10:15.620
Fucking hell, it's you! Isn't it?

10:19.120 --> 10:20.980
You're dating William!

10:23.060 --> 10:25.820
Eva, before you freak out here...

10:26.520 --> 10:29.080
Fucking hell. Fucking hell!

10:29.960 --> 10:33.980
Hallo, okay. We've been on one date
and I did it for Vilde.

10:34.340 --> 10:35.860
Why for Vilde?

10:35.860 --> 10:43.920
Because the stuff he said to her during Christmas,
he just said it because I promised I'd go on a date with him.

10:46.200 --> 10:48.100
Are you kidding me?

10:48.640 --> 10:51.740
Am I on an episode of Gossip Girl?

10:52.140 --> 10:54.660
Eva, you know I hate that show.

10:57.260 --> 10:59.020
This is totally sick!

11:05.880 --> 11:11.400
But you don't like him at all, right?

11:13.140 --> 11:16.520
Eva, it's William we're talking about here.

11:17.140 --> 11:18.700
So how was your date then?

11:18.780 --> 11:19.860
Weird!

11:23.800 --> 11:26.620
Do you realise now why I can't go to the party?

11:27.200 --> 11:31.580
If William starts to make a move on me...

11:32.420 --> 11:34.300
... Vilde will start to realise it.

11:36.760 --> 11:41.040
I just hope she doesn't start asking him about it.

11:41.740 --> 11:44.780
I don't trust him at all.

11:46.280 --> 11:48.760
Fucking hell. This is Gossip Girl.

11:49.240 --> 11:52.840
Okay, maybe a budget version.
But it's fucking Gossip Girl!

11:55.120 --> 11:58.880
I've had it with all the Gossip Girl references now.

11:59.120 --> 12:00.600
Funny!

12:01.500 --> 12:03.240
Noora, you're impressive.

12:03.460 --> 12:04.540
Thanks.

12:19.420 --> 12:23.040
I don't understand how Eskild can party so much.

12:23.780 --> 12:28.420
I think it's lovely to just be at home and relax.
Don't you agree?

12:30.620 --> 12:31.440
Hm-hm.

12:36.540 --> 12:38.700
Does school suck?

12:50.980 --> 12:55.500
I hated high school. It truly sucked.

13:01.040 --> 13:04.640
The teachers had no sympathy.

13:04.880 --> 13:09.940
"The curriculum is the same for everyone."
Easy for them to say.

13:24.100 --> 13:26.760
We are the performance generation.

13:26.840 --> 13:29.920
We have it a little worse than they had.

13:35.700 --> 13:37.500
At first I was like that as well.

13:37.940 --> 13:39.520
"Fuck this shit."

13:41.080 --> 13:42.600
"I need a year off."

13:46.400 --> 13:51.700
Drama between Vilde and William. Vilde is crying in the bathroom.

14:35.120 --> 14:36.920
Since you're already standing up...

14:37.660 --> 14:40.280
... could you hand me a Fun light?

15:07.000 --> 15:09.980
Noora! Hi!

15:13.080 --> 15:15.020
What happened? Where's Vilde?

15:16.580 --> 15:17.660
She ran away.

15:21.400 --> 15:23.280
But you're here now!

15:27.000 --> 15:28.760
But... what happened?

15:28.840 --> 15:31.600
You said there was some drama between Vilde and William.

15:32.220 --> 15:33.380
Shit!

15:36.620 --> 15:42.380
She's so in love with William,
but I don't think he's in love with her.

15:45.620 --> 15:48.460
They didn't say anything about me?

15:48.560 --> 15:50.480
They said nothing?

15:50.560 --> 15:51.660
No.
-No?

15:53.980 --> 15:56.100
Shhh. Shhh!

15:57.280 --> 15:58.660
You were on a date!

16:00.960 --> 16:02.240
Do you think he...

16:05.300 --> 16:07.480
I don't know, but I have to...

16:07.540 --> 16:09.500
Yeah, you have to go say hi!

16:10.000 --> 16:12.260
Halvor... and Jacob!

16:15.280 --> 16:18.980
He is so sweet. He's almost my boyfriend.

16:24.400 --> 16:28.980
No! Jonas! You came!

16:34.820 --> 16:36.520
We are best forever, right?

16:36.960 --> 16:39.240
I love you so fucking much. Did you know that?

16:41.000 --> 16:42.760
I've said it a few times already.

16:51.920 --> 16:53.680
Drink a little, guys.

16:55.220 --> 16:57.320
You should meet girls.

17:12.220 --> 17:13.540
Where are you going?

17:14.200 --> 17:15.420
To the toilet.

17:15.820 --> 17:17.280
You can't leave her.

17:17.680 --> 17:19.440
It takes two seconds.

17:29.300 --> 17:31.460
I'll be back soon, okay?

18:10.820 --> 18:12.300
You came.

18:12.360 --> 18:13.840
What did you say to Vilde?

18:14.580 --> 18:15.220
What?

18:15.380 --> 18:17.500
She walked out crying.

18:18.220 --> 18:20.900
She wanted to hook up,
but I wasn't interested.

18:21.440 --> 18:23.200
You didn't say anything about me?

18:23.600 --> 18:25.040
About you? Who are you?

18:26.680 --> 18:29.160
I'm kidding. Of course I didn't say anything about you.

18:34.160 --> 18:35.580
Fuck off!

18:36.140 --> 18:37.400
What the hell is going on here?

18:47.700 --> 18:48.540
Who are you?

18:48.860 --> 18:51.420
William.
-William? Axel.

18:51.960 --> 18:55.500
The party you're having here...
You have to put an end to it.

18:55.720 --> 18:59.120
We've gotten complaints from your neighbors.

19:01.200 --> 19:05.160
Music off, and people out.

19:05.480 --> 19:08.000
Everyone. Great.

19:10.620 --> 19:11.780
Eva?

19:15.340 --> 19:16.580
Hello!

19:16.640 --> 19:18.920
The party is over, ladies and gentlemen.

19:26.400 --> 19:29.320
William, I have to borrow your cellphone.

19:29.320 --> 19:32.220
Eva left with all my stuff.

20:14.000 --> 20:20.420
Hi Eskild. I have lost everything.
My phone and keys.

20:20.760 --> 20:23.720
Call me when you get this message.

20:24.120 --> 20:25.180
On this number.

21:03.580 --> 21:04.700
Chris.

21:06.020 --> 21:07.480
It's time to leave.

21:17.220 --> 21:18.180
Are you coming with me?

21:23.280 --> 21:24.480
Kidding...

21:30.980 --> 21:32.360
Did you get to her?

21:32.800 --> 21:33.580
No.

21:34.080 --> 21:39.400
But I left a message on the voice mail
of someone I live with so...

21:39.560 --> 21:41.400
He'll definitely call back soon.

21:50.440 --> 21:52.300
When are your parents coming home?

21:56.380 --> 21:57.820
They're not coming home.

21:59.320 --> 22:00.300
Where are they?

22:02.760 --> 22:05.740
Dad lives in London and mom lives
on Snarøya with a new man.

22:07.520 --> 22:08.900
You live here by yourself?

22:10.280 --> 22:11.600
More or less.

22:12.060 --> 22:12.920
I don't drink.

22:14.520 --> 22:15.320
Shock...

22:17.260 --> 22:20.520
Don't you have siblings?

22:23.220 --> 22:24.920
My brother studies in Stockholm.

22:27.680 --> 22:28.760
Do you want something else?

22:32.500 --> 22:34.860
Do you have... cocoa?

22:40.100 --> 22:41.380
Baking cocoa?

22:41.820 --> 22:47.680
Yeah, I don't know why I got it. The lady at the
check out got it for me so it was okay.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.500
It says something about dark cocoa drink here.

22:50.820 --> 22:52.720
Extra dark and powerful cocoa.

22:58.340 --> 23:03.480
Five tablespoons of Freia baking cocoa.

23:03.720 --> 23:07.780
Four to five tablespoons of sugar.

23:07.880 --> 23:09.580
Yeah?
-Yeah!

23:09.660 --> 23:15.020
Don't you remember how to make it?
-I do, but I just want to do it right.

23:16.780 --> 23:17.500
Okay.

23:56.020 --> 23:58.140
Why don't you live with your mom?

24:02.020 --> 24:03.680
Because my mom is a cunt.

24:04.720 --> 24:05.760
Hey...

24:06.040 --> 24:06.780
What?

24:08.200 --> 24:09.780
It's still your mom.

24:10.080 --> 24:13.720
So what?
Should I not be honest?

24:14.460 --> 24:20.140
Sure, but you don't need to be a complete
misogynist about it.

24:20.540 --> 24:23.520
So you only want me to be honest if it's politically correct?

24:26.460 --> 24:28.580
Has Eskild called?

24:29.280 --> 24:29.820
No.

24:30.820 --> 24:33.420
You have to check your cellphone.

24:45.940 --> 24:46.780
Fuck.

25:11.180 --> 25:12.260
Do you want one?

25:13.340 --> 25:15.300
Oh my god, seriously?

25:16.500 --> 25:17.760
Can I have it?

25:21.820 --> 25:22.940
Do I look good?

25:23.380 --> 25:28.560
It's the sweater of all sweaters.
Many at school have acquired it.

25:28.800 --> 25:32.700
Insanely popular.
Then I would've been just like you.

25:32.820 --> 25:34.040
That's the dream, right?

25:38.360 --> 25:39.740
A guitar too?

25:40.100 --> 25:43.900
Have we really come to this point?
There's nothing missing then, so to speak.

25:46.100 --> 25:48.060
Do you play for girls?

25:50.040 --> 25:51.100
So sweet.

25:54.760 --> 25:55.860
Sweet, indeed.

25:55.860 --> 25:56.960
Yeah.

25:57.520 --> 26:02.760
Do you play for them before you take them to bed?
You have to, right?

26:03.120 --> 26:04.760
You have to do something.

26:05.940 --> 26:09.080
What do you play?
-I don't play for girls.

26:09.560 --> 26:14.580
Yes you do.
What else? Oof.

26:15.300 --> 26:18.580
There's sound! It's a real one, then?

26:19.120 --> 26:22.600
You obviously play for girls. I know it.
What do you play?

26:24.060 --> 26:25.720
Is it country?

26:26.960 --> 26:29.980
I know what you play.
You just..

26:49.320 --> 26:52.900
Was that it? No? No..

26:53.060 --> 26:54.800
Then it's more like..

27:16.520 --> 27:19.860
With a little rapping. No? Really?

27:19.980 --> 27:22.560
Now I know, William.
I know it.

29:14.580 --> 29:15.840
I think it's for you.

29:19.860 --> 29:22.840
Hello, where are you?
-At home. What's up?

29:22.940 --> 29:27.360
I lost all my stuff.
Keys, cellphone, everything.

29:27.400 --> 29:31.020
Okay, so... That sucks.
-It really sucks!

29:31.920 --> 29:36.960
At least I'm at home now.
Just call from downstairs and I'll let you in.

29:37.400 --> 29:42.100
Yeah... Yeah okay. Bye.

29:50.420 --> 29:51.900
Is he home?

29:56.680 --> 30:05.940
Eh, no. No.
He is in the city with some people.

30:07.200 --> 30:08.820
So...

30:26.220 --> 30:28.240
I can sleep on the couch.

30:29.160 --> 30:32.720
Oh, no. This works, right?

30:32.720 --> 30:39.220
Just stick to your side of the bed, okay?

30:41.600 --> 30:45.140
It's my bed, so both sides are mine.

30:45.160 --> 30:49.560
No. That's not how it works here now, William.

30:49.880 --> 30:52.420
You may not be used to this, but...

30:52.420 --> 30:54.660
... there are sides to this bed.

30:54.720 --> 30:58.180
This is your side. This is my side.

30:58.180 --> 31:01.920
I suggest that we build a little border.

31:03.380 --> 31:09.380
So don't come over and invade my personal space.

31:19.660 --> 31:22.760
Are you going to sleep with all your clothes on?
-Yes.

31:26.380 --> 31:27.300
Okay.

31:34.620 --> 31:36.660
What do you want for breakfast tomorrow?

31:40.520 --> 31:42.860
I won't be eating breakfast here.

31:45.800 --> 31:47.500
Eggs and bacon? Great.

31:52.320 --> 31:55.880
You are the biggest cliché I've met.

31:56.100 --> 31:58.900
Ever!

32:01.700 --> 32:04.660
I was never validated as a child.

32:05.200 --> 32:09.920
Mom never came to graduation.
Dad never complimented my drawings.

32:12.920 --> 32:13.880
Okay.

32:18.700 --> 32:20.200
But you like me for it.

32:22.580 --> 32:23.840
No, I don't.

32:23.980 --> 32:25.240
Yes, you do. You like me.

32:40.600 --> 32:44.780
What is it?
Is there someone you have to beat up?

32:46.700 --> 32:48.760
It's a message from Eskild.

32:50.380 --> 32:56.120
He doesn't want to stay up and wait for you any longer
and wonders when you're coming home.

32:58.280 --> 33:06.080
I'll answer:
Noora is so keen on me...

33:06.120 --> 33:10.040
... that she failed to get away.

33:10.040 --> 33:15.120
Excuse me? No! You're not writing that!
-Excuse me, you're on my side now!

33:16.600 --> 33:21.020
Can you... please get over on your side?
-Can I?

33:21.020 --> 33:24.580
That's your side of the bed.

33:24.960 --> 33:30.260
And this is my side of the bed.

33:38.900 --> 33:42.540
So we're going to let the cellphone and pillows be.

33:42.540 --> 33:44.540
Let go, let go, let go!

33:59.960 --> 34:02.460
Just write that I'm coming home tomorrow.

34:18.040 --> 34:19.600
You like me.

34:26.020 --> 34:28.360
Goodnight, Willhelm.

34:34.520 --> 34:35.880
Goodnight, Noora.
