WEBVTT

00:08.490 --> 00:11.659
What was the name of that song?
Stop, you're hurting my ears?

00:13.495 --> 00:16.764
Yes, it's off my new cd
called Alex is a cow, moo.

00:17.800 --> 00:20.235
Hey, we have
a sister named Alex!

00:22.571 --> 00:24.339
All right, everybody,
listen up.

00:24.907 --> 00:27.308
For today's lesson, we have a
special guest from the wizard world

00:27.343 --> 00:31.446
Coming to talk to you guys
about a very important subject:

00:31.480 --> 00:34.082
The future.

00:34.116 --> 00:36.784
Oh. You mean
two minutes from now,

00:36.819 --> 00:39.487
When I'll be faking a stomach
ache to get out of this lesson?

00:39.521 --> 00:42.557
No, I'm talking about
you kids finding jobs one day.

00:42.591 --> 00:46.394
Oh! Stomach ache. Look at that,
it came two minutes early.

00:48.430 --> 00:50.431
Mr. Stuffleby! Welcome.

00:50.466 --> 00:54.569
Kids, I'd like you to meet your
new wizard guidance counselor.

00:54.603 --> 00:59.307
Oh. Hate to be impolite, but
what's up with your fa, dude?

00:59.341 --> 01:02.577
My mother
is one quarter gargoyle.

01:02.611 --> 01:06.381
It's a bit distracting,
but you'll get used to it.

01:06.415 --> 01:10.151
Not likely. I'm not
even used to Justin's face.

01:11.887 --> 01:14.255
As you all know,
one of you is destined

01:14.290 --> 01:16.357
To win the family
wizard competition,

01:16.392 --> 01:18.826
Thus becoming an adult wizard

01:18.861 --> 01:22.330
And going on to live a life of
incredible excitement and adventure.

01:22.364 --> 01:24.198
That will probably be me.

01:25.567 --> 01:27.402
Two of you, on the other hand,

01:27.436 --> 01:29.604
Will lose your powers forever,

01:29.638 --> 01:31.973
Instantly becoming
ordinary human beings,

01:32.007 --> 01:36.311
Completely average and unremarkable
in every conceivable way.

01:36.345 --> 01:37.378
Like your father.

01:39.114 --> 01:41.449
- No offense.
- Too late.

01:43.752 --> 01:47.255
So, in the event that you lose
the wizard competition,

01:47.289 --> 01:52.260
I've been sent here to see to it that you
each establish an acceptable backup plan,

01:52.294 --> 01:56.331
Or "plan b,"
one that is... Yes?

01:56.365 --> 01:59.767
Does it hurt to always
be smiling like that?

02:01.503 --> 02:04.072
Actually, it's more
of a numb feeling.

02:04.106 --> 02:07.275
But back to my point.

02:07.309 --> 02:13.247
Like all young wizards, you must choose
mortal jobs that will provide you... Yes?

02:13.282 --> 02:15.850
Do bugs ever go in your mouth?

02:15.884 --> 02:20.355
All the time.
Especially dragonflies.

02:20.389 --> 02:23.391
But remember, I'm part gargoyle,
so they're delicious.

02:24.994 --> 02:26.794
Are there any other questions?

02:28.464 --> 02:30.898
That don't involve my face.

02:36.205 --> 02:39.974
I don't see this going well.

02:41.000 --> 02:47.074

03:36.665 --> 03:38.833
What are you doing
with my guitar?

03:38.867 --> 03:41.936
Nothing.
You're using it in a band.

03:41.970 --> 03:47.241
My band. Because my plan b is to
be a famous rock and roll drummer.

03:47.276 --> 03:50.945
Drummer? You never
even play pattycake right.

03:52.247 --> 03:53.748
You still don't get it.

03:53.782 --> 03:56.250
I wanted to hit you in the face.

04:01.056 --> 04:02.690
I'm busy with my own plan b.

04:03.025 --> 04:06.360
I'm gonna make money touring the
world beating robots at chess.

04:09.965 --> 04:13.367
Look, Justin, I didn't want
to have to say this,

04:13.402 --> 04:16.103
But you're really good
at guitar.

04:18.607 --> 04:20.440
Well...

04:21.743 --> 04:26.214
I've always known I had
something special musically.

04:26.248 --> 04:28.049
I've just been too
afraid to admit it.

04:30.419 --> 04:32.386
You're not just
manipulating me, are you?

04:32.421 --> 04:35.323
No. Great. So then
I guess we're in a band.

04:35.357 --> 04:39.460
Band? With me...?
No.

04:39.495 --> 04:42.330
All I need is me.
And my soulful lyrics.

04:42.364 --> 04:45.933
And my bare feet in
a sandbox on the cd cover.

04:45.968 --> 04:50.138
And a fishing net with, like,
shells and treasure in it.

04:50.172 --> 04:53.474
Well, why don't
you use that net

04:53.509 --> 04:56.844
To catch the one person
that'll buy your album.

04:56.879 --> 04:58.412
Good one.

04:59.648 --> 05:01.349
Hey, honey.

05:01.383 --> 05:04.619
Um... Any luck
figuring out your plan b?

05:04.653 --> 05:09.891
Well, I've decided to follow my
dream and be a professional drummer.

05:09.925 --> 05:14.829
A drummer? This assignment is about
you finding something practical.

05:14.863 --> 05:16.864
Stuffleby's gonna
be back here on Thursday.

05:16.899 --> 05:19.901
And he may seem all smiles,
but he's not.

05:19.902 --> 05:22.103
Dad, come on.
Didn't you ever have a dream?

05:22.137 --> 05:23.838
Yes, a practical dream.

05:23.872 --> 05:27.141
To own and operate my own
subway-themed sandwich shop.

05:27.176 --> 05:30.344
And look at me now.
Living the dream.

05:32.648 --> 05:36.017
- Hey, what's going on?
- Well, Alex has decided

05:36.051 --> 05:39.921
- That her backup plan is to be a musician.
- Cool.

05:39.955 --> 05:43.791
- I was just gonna work at the sub station.
- That's my boy.

05:43.825 --> 05:47.695
But Alex's idea is way better.
I'll do that instead.

05:47.729 --> 05:50.965
Wait. Who's gonna
run the sub station?

05:50.999 --> 05:53.668
That's the only reason
we had you kids!

05:55.938 --> 05:56.938
Not you.

06:09.518 --> 06:12.687
<i>âª oh, I would
run a kilometer for you âª</i>

06:12.721 --> 06:15.389
<i>âª and on my little
thermometer for you âª</i>

06:15.424 --> 06:19.961
<i>âª I'm burning up âª</i>

06:19.995 --> 06:21.862
In celsius.

06:21.897 --> 06:24.599
<i>âª oh, metric system
metric system âª</i>

06:24.633 --> 06:27.768
<i>âª if there are better systems I
must've missed 'em oh, metric system âª</i>

06:27.970 --> 06:30.771
<i>âª metric system if there are better
systems I must've missed them âª</i>

06:30.806 --> 06:35.576
Mom?
What are you doing?

06:35.611 --> 06:39.447
I'm harmonizing with my eldest
son. Didn't that give you chills?

06:39.481 --> 06:43.384
And the creep-outs.

06:43.418 --> 06:47.188
Oh, my gosh. You know what?
We should form a band!

06:47.222 --> 06:51.092
What do you say? We'll call
ourselves mother and son,

06:51.126 --> 06:53.594
So we don't get confused
as brother and sister.

06:54.997 --> 06:57.965
Oh... No.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.068
I... Can't.

07:01.103 --> 07:02.370
Why not?

07:04.072 --> 07:05.806
Because I'm
already in a band

07:05.841 --> 07:07.408
And that wouldn't be right.

07:07.442 --> 07:10.611
With who?

07:12.180 --> 07:15.416
This drumming thing
is gonna be so easy.

07:15.450 --> 07:19.253
- With Alex.
- Alex?

07:19.288 --> 07:22.723
- Justin said you guys are in a band together.
- He did?

07:22.758 --> 07:25.526
Yeah, and that's why he
can't be in a band with me.

07:27.095 --> 07:28.896
Now, I'm caught up.

07:30.932 --> 07:34.368
That's right, mom.
Justin is in a band with me.

07:34.403 --> 07:36.637
Well, that's too bad 'cause...

07:36.672 --> 07:40.041
<i>âª mother and son mother
and son we could've sung âª</i>

07:40.075 --> 07:42.843
<i>âª last chance to be
in a band with me âª</i>

07:50.986 --> 07:53.521
- Thanks. I owe you one.
- Oh, I know.

07:53.555 --> 07:55.256
Welcome to the band.

07:57.993 --> 08:00.661
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

08:00.696 --> 08:04.231
Mom, I brought
you the newspaper.

08:04.266 --> 08:08.602
Or... Possibly flowers.

08:10.672 --> 08:15.276
Oh. Thanks, honey. These are nice, but I
kind of wanted the coupons from the paper.

08:18.413 --> 08:22.450
- Max, what are you doing? - I'm practicing
to be a magician, same as you guys.

08:22.484 --> 08:26.120
That's great, Max.

08:26.154 --> 08:30.391
But we said "musician,"
not "magician."

08:37.299 --> 08:41.369
Maybe dad's right.
Less talking more listening.

08:41.403 --> 08:47.074
But it's just so hard to listen
with all this money in my ears.

09:01.156 --> 09:03.224
Ok, since this
is our first band practice,

09:03.258 --> 09:04.925
There are things
we gotta figure out.

09:04.960 --> 09:07.661
Right. Band outfits.
Way ahead of you.

09:07.696 --> 09:10.464
No.

09:10.499 --> 09:14.535
I was thinking we'd do
sort of a punk-rock thing.

09:16.338 --> 09:18.873
Oh! What about this?

09:21.510 --> 09:23.778
Or maybe...

09:28.750 --> 09:31.218
You didn't want to use
this one for the band, did you?

09:31.253 --> 09:33.487
Nope.

09:35.757 --> 09:38.192
Ok, we need to figure out
what we want to sound like.

09:38.627 --> 09:42.196
For example, I like soft, meaningful guitar
plucking. And I like to play barefoot.

09:42.230 --> 09:44.031
It shows how
I fight conventions.

09:44.132 --> 09:47.334
Walk outside barefoot,
you'll be fighting infections.

09:47.369 --> 09:52.706
Convections? Infections? It rhymes.
It's a lyric. Let's put it in a song!

09:54.543 --> 09:58.078
Ok... Ah!
Follow my lead.

09:58.113 --> 10:02.516
And a one, and a two, and...

10:02.551 --> 10:04.618
Play on four.
Four and...

10:04.653 --> 10:06.554
You don't...

10:10.091 --> 10:13.093
- I wanna start with a solo.
- It's not backwards day.

10:13.128 --> 10:17.965
- Why can't we in the beginning?
- What is going on up here?

10:17.999 --> 10:21.769
Justin's in your band?
What'd you do, bribe him?

10:21.803 --> 10:25.806
No. Of course not.
It was more like blackmail.

10:25.841 --> 10:31.178
I knew it. I'm sure your brother had
something practical as his plan b.

10:31.213 --> 10:34.849
That I did. I wanted to make
money beating robots at chess.

10:36.251 --> 10:38.986
Is working at the
sub station that bad?

10:40.188 --> 10:44.625
Daddy, being in a band
is a great plan b.

10:44.659 --> 10:46.594
It's totally
gonna make us money.

10:48.296 --> 10:51.131
All right. You think you can
make money, let's prove it.

10:51.166 --> 10:53.767
You'll put on a concert
at the sub station,

10:53.802 --> 10:58.005
And if you can bring in an audience, then
you can consider this band your plan b.

10:59.741 --> 11:02.443
- What if we don't?
- Then you'll give up this ridiculous dream

11:02.477 --> 11:05.279
Once and for all
and you'll work downstairs.

11:05.313 --> 11:07.982
- Is it a deal?
- Sure, dad.

11:08.783 --> 11:10.084
Here you go.

11:10.118 --> 11:12.019
Come listen
to the loudest band in town.

11:12.120 --> 11:14.388
I hear they got a great drummer.
She's cute, too.

11:14.422 --> 11:16.790
- Hey, Alex.
- Hey.

11:16.825 --> 11:18.959
Concert at waverly sub station.
Don't miss it.

11:18.994 --> 11:22.696
You named the band burn
without even consulting me?

11:22.731 --> 11:25.933
I do everything without consulting
you. Why should I start now?

11:25.967 --> 11:30.037
Because maybe I had a different
idea for our band name.

11:30.071 --> 11:32.740
Possibly with more of a
reference to medieval plant life.

11:32.774 --> 11:35.709
Yes, because kids
love medieval plant life.

11:37.279 --> 11:40.514
Look, I came up with the idea of
being a band, so I should name it.

11:40.549 --> 11:44.318
Yeah, but I'm a better
musician. I'm all...

11:44.352 --> 11:49.557
And the crowd's all... "Justin!
You're so good-looking!"

11:49.591 --> 11:52.059
And you're all...

11:52.093 --> 11:54.862
- The crowd's all, "when's the
guitar coming back?" - Justin!

11:54.896 --> 11:59.500
You know what? I'm very
annoyed with you right now!

11:59.534 --> 12:01.735
You know what?
I'm kicking you out of the band!

12:02.003 --> 12:05.039
You can't kick me out of the band,
'cause I'm kicking you out of the band!

12:05.073 --> 12:08.108
You can't kick me out of the band!
I already kicked you out of the band!

12:08.143 --> 12:09.743
- Fine!
- Fine!

12:19.474 --> 12:23.244
Hello, Alex. I just stopped by to
see how it's going with your plan b.

12:23.278 --> 12:26.480
Well, it's not going so great.
I probably should've stuck

12:26.515 --> 12:28.816
To the sub station as my plan b,
just like my dad did.

12:28.850 --> 12:33.220
What? Your dad's plan b
wasn't to own the sub station.

12:33.255 --> 12:35.890
It was to be
a professional bull rider.

12:35.924 --> 12:39.827
- It was?
- He called himself "the italian buckaroo."

12:39.861 --> 12:42.496
He had jean jackets
made up and everything.

12:42.531 --> 12:46.634
- You're kidding.
- Do I look like I'm kidding?

12:47.402 --> 12:49.170
Don't answer that.

12:49.204 --> 12:52.873
- Wow, so he never went after his dream?
- No.

12:52.908 --> 12:55.309
I think his dad
talked him out of it.

12:55.343 --> 12:58.112
And then he ended up owning
a sandwich shop instead?

12:58.146 --> 13:01.115
That's right.

13:11.993 --> 13:15.930
Hey. Uh, you remember that
one time I apologized to you?

13:15.964 --> 13:18.365
No. When was that?

13:18.400 --> 13:21.869
Oh, my goodness. Can we please stop
talking about it? You get the point.

13:21.903 --> 13:25.639
Are you trying to
apologize to me, Alex?

13:25.674 --> 13:28.342
Yes. How many times do
I have to say, "I'm sorry"?

13:28.376 --> 13:30.644
Actually, you
haven't said it.

13:30.679 --> 13:33.848
I think we should get
the band back together.

13:33.882 --> 13:36.617
Go on.

13:36.651 --> 13:40.020
Because it's important for us to chase
our dreams while we're still young.

13:40.055 --> 13:42.790
And I'm even willing to
compromise in order to do it.

13:42.824 --> 13:46.227
So if you play
my kind of music...

13:46.261 --> 13:48.496
I can't believe
I'm about to say this.

13:48.530 --> 13:52.867
...I'll let you
name... The band.

13:54.769 --> 13:57.304
- I'll take that deal.
- Great. Ok.

13:57.339 --> 14:00.174
Better get started. We've got
a lot to do before the concert.

14:00.208 --> 14:02.476
- Perfect. I'll put in some earplugs.
- Again.

14:02.511 --> 14:04.311
You are such a rock star.

14:23.832 --> 14:25.966
The great Maxini thanks you!

14:30.539 --> 14:32.840
Looks like you might
be working here after all.

14:32.974 --> 14:37.811
Here you go, Max. I took the liberty
of having it personalized. Huh?

14:37.846 --> 14:41.882
The great Maxini is offended
by your lack of support.

14:41.917 --> 14:45.786
His next trick
will blow your minds.

14:46.821 --> 14:49.056
After it pops into my mind.

14:51.126 --> 14:54.662
I had some made for you
guys, too. Just in case. Huh?

14:54.696 --> 14:56.864
Thanks for the support, dad.

14:57.699 --> 14:58.799
You're on.

15:10.312 --> 15:11.412
Hi.

15:13.381 --> 15:15.683
Thanks for coming out.

15:15.717 --> 15:18.852
- We're the alabaster carnation.
- Oh, my gosh.

15:20.755 --> 15:22.056
One, two, three!

15:39.507 --> 15:44.044
<i>âª you won't know anything

15:44.079 --> 15:47.915

<i>âª you know it's all about

15:52.387 --> 15:56.724

16:13.742 --> 16:17.745
<i>âª I won't be whining

16:17.779 --> 16:21.982
<i>âª you know I'm not too big
on giving in âª</i>

16:22.017 --> 16:26.186
<i>âª I use whatever spell

16:26.221 --> 16:29.289

16:54.916 --> 16:59.119

16:59.154 --> 17:03.757

17:16.003 --> 17:18.605
- We did it!
- That was unbelievable!

17:18.640 --> 17:22.910
Alabaster carnation!
Alabaster carnation!

17:22.944 --> 17:26.480
Hi, I'm harvey buchwald. I'm
president of legitimate records.

17:26.513 --> 17:29.083
I think you got a real
future as a girl drummer.

17:29.117 --> 17:31.719
- Here's my card.
- Thank you.

17:31.753 --> 17:35.522
Oh, my gosh! Your guitar playing
like totally spoke to us.

17:35.557 --> 17:39.293
Well, as a musician, that's
all you can ever hope for.

17:39.327 --> 17:41.328
- Who wants my sweat towel?
- I do!

17:41.362 --> 17:44.298
Take it. Put your number
down on my hand.

17:44.332 --> 17:47.801
Hold on... I'll get your...

17:49.104 --> 17:51.271
- What a show!
- You liked it.

17:51.306 --> 17:55.109
Of course I liked it!
I'm smiling, aren't I?

17:55.143 --> 17:58.011
Usually music isn't the
best choice for a plan b,

17:58.046 --> 18:02.516
But not for you two.
You can't miss! Can't miss!

18:02.550 --> 18:05.819
Honey, I'm so
proud of you.

18:05.854 --> 18:09.223
It was great. Ybe missing a
more mature female vocal element,

18:09.257 --> 18:11.091
But still,
I really liked it.

18:11.126 --> 18:15.229
Yeah, I should've had
more faith in your abilities.

18:15.263 --> 18:19.600
You guys proved me wrong and you did it
the right way, without using any magic.

18:19.634 --> 18:22.469
- You didn't use magic, did you?
- No.

18:22.504 --> 18:25.305
Yes, it's true.

18:25.340 --> 18:27.541
Justin and Alex
didn't use any magic.

18:27.575 --> 18:32.212
But... The great Maxini did!

18:33.481 --> 18:34.748
What?

18:37.085 --> 18:40.320
- Max, what did you do?
- Dude!

18:40.355 --> 18:43.824
The audience was
all an illusion.

18:43.858 --> 18:46.860
The great Maxini thanks you!

18:49.731 --> 18:51.799
Make yourself disappear.

18:57.138 --> 19:01.942
Hey, um, you remember that time
I said I was sorry? Right?

19:01.976 --> 19:04.244
Yeah, you didn't.

19:05.847 --> 19:10.551
- Your sister's been trying
that for years. - He's right.

19:10.585 --> 19:15.255
Which is why, from now on, we're
videotaping all apologies in this family.

19:17.592 --> 19:19.793
Jerry, can you stand
a little closer to Max?

19:23.464 --> 19:25.999
Look, you guys
sounded great.

19:26.034 --> 19:30.103
But because of you, Max, we won't know
if music is a viable career or not.

19:30.138 --> 19:33.207
- Dad, it's ok.
- No, Justin. It's not.

19:33.241 --> 19:37.744
I need to know that everything's
gonna be ok for my kids.

19:37.779 --> 19:40.647
But that's just it, dad.

19:40.682 --> 19:42.416
You can never be sure of that.

19:42.450 --> 19:45.018
Sometimes dreams
don't work out.

19:45.053 --> 19:47.221
But that doesn't
mean we shouldn't try.

19:47.255 --> 19:52.226
I mean, you can understand that,
right, "italian buckaroo"?

19:55.496 --> 19:58.232
Theresa, shut
the camera off.

20:00.268 --> 20:02.569
Where did you
hear that name?

20:02.604 --> 20:06.607
Mr. Stuffleby told me about your
dream of being a bull rider.

20:06.641 --> 20:09.576
What a mouth on that guy.

20:09.611 --> 20:14.014
Is that true, jerry?
"italian buckaroo"?

20:14.048 --> 20:17.251
Yes, it's true.
I wanted to be a bull rider.

20:17.285 --> 20:20.821
But your dad wanted you
to do something practical?

20:20.855 --> 20:23.123
No. He was a rodeo clown.

20:23.157 --> 20:26.393
He thought bull riders
were stuck-up.

20:26.427 --> 20:31.098
Wait. Grandpa
was a rodeo clown?

20:31.132 --> 20:33.233
That's my plan b.
I call it.

20:35.403 --> 20:38.672
Look, I'm sorry if I was getting
in the way of your dreams.

20:38.706 --> 20:42.376
Actually, dad,
it's kind of reassuring to know

20:42.410 --> 20:46.413
That you didn't have a practical backup plan
and your life still turned out pretty good.

20:46.447 --> 20:50.384
Yeah, my life
did turn out pretty good.

20:50.418 --> 20:52.853
I'm really proud of you guys.

20:52.887 --> 20:55.889
You did something
not even I had the guts to do.

20:55.924 --> 20:59.359
It must feel good
to chase your dreams.

21:00.595 --> 21:04.064
Well, maybe you should find that
out for yourself.

21:08.069 --> 21:11.505
Next up, the italian buckaroo.

21:14.542 --> 21:17.177
All right, for probably about
the next one to seven seconds,

21:17.211 --> 21:19.246
You'll feel what it's
like to live your dream.

21:19.280 --> 21:22.149
And my guess is it's gonna
feel a lot like chafing.

21:26.919 --> 21:29.356
I'm... Living the dream!

21:33.061 --> 21:38.065
- Mom, what's your dream?
- That this is over soon so we can go home.

21:41.369 --> 21:42.936
Looks like we're done.

21:50.909 --> 21:55.078
âª you won't know anything
unless you try âª

21:55.113 --> 21:59.383
âª might end up falling
but you just might fly âª

21:59.417 --> 22:03.620
âª you know it's all about
what you believe âª
