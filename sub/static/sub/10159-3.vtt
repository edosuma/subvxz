03:34.720 --> 03:36.278

you're not going to get randomly kettled

I'll get kettled. How reassuring(!)

that on 1 00% of my visits to London,

03:47.920 --> 03:49.638
I have been kettled.

03:49.680 --> 03:54.356

She's a what?.

11:58.880 --> 12:00.313
VOD: Oh, there she is.

12:00.360 --> 12:01.793
- (PHONE CHlMES AND VlBRATES)
- Oi, Paz.

12:01.840 --> 12:03.353
OREGON: Nas?. What?.

12:03.400 --> 12:06.790
But it's been 24 hours.
How can they still be there?.

12:06.840 --> 12:09.400
Jesus Christ,
what more do they want from me?.

12:09.440 --> 12:12.193
- Everything OK?.
- Yeah. Everything's brilliant.

12:12.240 --> 12:14.913
- Oh, Vod! Welcome.
- Ahh!

12:18.280 --> 12:21.636
I'm the guy with Dropout Boogie
by Beefheart going in one earphone,

12:21.680 --> 12:23.830
and September by Earth Wind & Fire
in the other.

12:26.640 --> 12:29.154
Hurry up, I've got just enough time
to get to my interview.

12:29.200 --> 12:31.839
- What's the quickest way to Temple?.
- Haven't you checked?.

12:31.880 --> 12:34.553
Well, no, I thought they'd send a car.

12:34.600 --> 12:36.636
Oh, here, I've got a map.

12:36.680 --> 12:40.070
Howard's day bag has useful items
for every eventuality.

12:40.120 --> 12:42.270
Mind the gap.

12:43.920 --> 12:46.673
- Oh, hold on, that's my application.
- Get on with it!

12:46.720 --> 12:48.073
Get on! I'm gonna be late.

12:48.120 --> 12:50.270
- Howard, get on the train.
- Come on!

12:57.480 --> 12:58.959
Driver!

12:59.000 --> 13:02.959
What's the protocol now?. Do we get off
at the nex station and go back?.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.194
What if Howard's got on the nex train

13:04.240 --> 13:05.798
and then he gets off at the nex station
and goes back,

13:05.840 --> 13:07.512
but then we're already
on the nex train forwards?.

13:07.560 --> 13:09.437
Where does it end?.
I don't have time for this shit.

13:09.480 --> 13:11.311
We'll just call him
when we get above ground.

13:11.360 --> 13:14.636
Howard's from Glasgow, isn't he?.
He can look after himself.

13:16.280 --> 13:18.316
And then I printed out my essay

13:18.360 --> 13:23.434
and that was just loads of meaningless
bits of paper all put together.

13:23.480 --> 13:25.357
And now I'm thinking...

13:25.400 --> 13:28.358
(SlGHS)... I don't know what to do.

13:28.400 --> 13:31.312
That is an obscene amount of money
to spend on shuttlecocks.

13:31.360 --> 13:35.672
I say we cut Bad Soc funding in half
and send that back to murderball.

13:35.720 --> 13:37.233
Yeah, uh-huh. Mm, uh-huh.

13:37.280 --> 13:40.829
Mm-hm. OK, OK.
Now read me the budget for hockey.

13:40.880 --> 13:44.190
Why not get yourself a meaningless
bit of paper, if that's what you want?.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.151
I don't know if it is what I want.

13:46.200 --> 13:49.670
You know,
and I owe all this money and, ugh,

13:49.720 --> 13:53.918
no idea how I'm gonna pay it back,
and what if it was like the band?.

13:53.960 --> 13:55.996
- Cor!
- You know?.

13:56.040 --> 13:59.112
Cos at the beginning, we were all like,
we're gonna be famous,

13:59.160 --> 14:00.957
our lyrics are gonna change the world,

14:01.000 --> 14:02.831
- and we actually believed it.
- Yeah!

14:02.880 --> 14:06.953
Then we were, like, sleeping in the back
of a van for three years.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.228
Tssh.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.513
Ohh.

14:11.560 --> 14:16.634
What if this whole university thing's
just another pointless dream?.

14:16.680 --> 14:18.477
Oh, come on.

14:18.520 --> 14:19.794
Come on.

14:45.040 --> 14:47.838
All I'm saying is,
there's no boundaries any more.

14:47.880 --> 14:50.474
We're in a post-genre landscape.
It's fucking anarchy.

14:50.520 --> 14:52.909
And I'm just watching it all play out

14:52.960 --> 14:55.315
with Forever Changes by Love
on heavy rotation.

14:58.120 --> 15:01.351
OK, then, peeps. Let's kick things off
with the first question.

15:01.400 --> 15:05.279
Er, Kingsley,
how would you describe your work ethic?.

15:24.400 --> 15:27.995
So, what's with this Jobbo thing, then?.

15:28.040 --> 15:31.589
You just imagined a new personality
out of thin air?.

15:31.640 --> 15:34.438
- Yeah, why not?.
- Where'd you get your, er, inspiration?.

15:34.480 --> 15:35.959
Oh, where'd you get your lipstick?.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.197
I got it from a really crazy little shop

15:39.240 --> 15:40.992
- you've never even heard of.
- Oh.

15:41.040 --> 15:42.314
What can I say?.

15:42.360 --> 15:44.749
When God made Jobbo,

15:44.800 --> 15:46.950
- he broke the mould.
- PAZ: Hi, guys.

15:48.320 --> 15:50.595
Right, some more info.

15:52.120 --> 15:54.031
All right, there we are.

16:04.800 --> 16:07.394
First of all, let me say
how impressed we are with your CV.

16:07.440 --> 16:10.398
And from what your brother's told me,
I think you're exactly the kind of chap

16:10.440 --> 16:12.317
we're looking for
here at Frome & Harrington.

16:12.360 --> 16:14.999
I'm just gonna run you through
a couple of simple questions.

16:15.040 --> 16:16.678
I'm sure it's nothing you can't handle.

16:19.800 --> 16:23.156
What do you feel you'd bring to the role
of wealth manager's assistant?.

16:23.200 --> 16:24.872
(HE PUFFS)

16:24.920 --> 16:26.797
Mm.

16:26.840 --> 16:28.671
I'd probably bring...

16:30.440 --> 16:32.078
...cheese sandwiches.

16:32.120 --> 16:34.554
- I'm sorry?.
- And a little flask of tea.

16:34.600 --> 16:37.672
You know, one of those ones
with the little...detachable cup on top.

16:37.720 --> 16:41.474
I meant qualities you'd bring
that make you suitable for the role.

16:41.520 --> 16:43.317
OK. First up...

16:45.760 --> 16:47.398
... I've got a great sense of humour.

16:48.440 --> 16:50.271
No?. Um... Sure.

16:50.320 --> 16:53.995
I can see you're looking at me, thinking,
"Jonathan, wouldn't it, for example,

16:54.040 --> 16:57.874
"be better to mention
something like maths at this point??"

16:57.920 --> 17:02.391
But, actually, I'd be up for any kind of
evil shit you want me to undertake.

17:02.440 --> 17:05.159
Er, gambling with people's pensions,

17:05.200 --> 17:07.031
Iying about investments,

17:07.079 --> 17:08.512
hiding Nazi gold.

17:08.560 --> 17:09.753
Sign me up.

17:09.800 --> 17:11.869
I just wanna get my Christmas bonus.

17:11.920 --> 17:15.515
And I will do literally anything
to get it.

17:15.560 --> 17:19.269
So, yeah, I guess you could put that down
as a quality.

17:19.319 --> 17:20.992
I dunno what you'd call that.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.916
Grasping.

17:22.960 --> 17:24.712
Greedy.

17:24.760 --> 17:25.875
Ruthless.

17:27.359 --> 17:28.315
Amoral.

17:28.359 --> 17:30.032
Yes, Jonathan,
that's not quite what I meant.

17:30.080 --> 17:31.274
- Look...
- Oh!

17:31.320 --> 17:35.199
I don't care about the old people
or the poor people,

17:35.240 --> 17:39.153
any kind of people, except our people.

17:39.200 --> 17:40.553
Hm?.

17:40.600 --> 17:44.229
Now, that
is what makes me right for this job.

17:51.720 --> 17:53.199
Shall I take your plate?.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.753
Time for washing-up duty.

17:55.960 --> 17:58.872
OK, that's it. I can't take any more.

17:58.920 --> 18:01.480
Tell me what's going on here, please, Vod.

18:01.520 --> 18:04.876
- What d'you mean?.
- I mean...

18:04.920 --> 18:08.071
you have to have a trick
up your sleeve, right?.

18:08.120 --> 18:10.918
Like, um...
Like we're gonna steal all the drugs.

18:10.960 --> 18:14.032
Or a really hot guy's gonna turn up
who we all wanna have sex with,

18:14.080 --> 18:17.277
who maybe we will all have sex with,
cos it's just that kind of vibe.

18:17.320 --> 18:19.072
I'm not sure I follow.

18:19.120 --> 18:20.917
I'm talking about this place

18:20.960 --> 18:24.191
and how you've gotta have some sort
of ulterior motive for being here.

18:24.240 --> 18:26.879
Because it can't be over a desire
to do washing-up duty

18:26.920 --> 18:28.876
or read a big book of rules, can it, Vod?.

18:28.920 --> 18:31.354
- Shh.
- This isn't you.

18:31.400 --> 18:34.676
Yeah, well, maybe you don't know me
as well as you thought.

18:34.720 --> 18:37.473
PAZ: Sorry, no smoking in the main hall.

18:37.520 --> 18:40.990
Yeah, not so much anarchist commune
as, er, nanny state, eh, Paz?.

18:41.040 --> 18:43.679
Listen, Jobbo.

18:43.720 --> 18:46.314
I've gotta live with these people, OK?.

18:46.360 --> 18:48.157
So, try not to piss 'em off.

18:48.200 --> 18:50.475
What d'you mean, live with them?.

18:50.520 --> 18:53.557
You are coming back to Manchester,
aren't you, Vod?.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.558
OK, fine, look,
I didn't wanna make a big fuss about it,

18:56.600 --> 18:59.319
but I might be moving here.

18:59.360 --> 19:01.078
- When?.
- Now.

19:01.120 --> 19:04.430
You can't just drop out
right before your exams. That's madness.

19:04.480 --> 19:06.550
Why d'you care, Jobbo?.

19:10.400 --> 19:13.073
OK, guys, if I call your name,
you're through to the nex round.

19:13.120 --> 19:16.430
If I don't call your name, thanks so much
for coming, you haven't made it this time,

19:16.480 --> 19:19.472
but there is feedback available
over by Simeon.

19:19.520 --> 19:21.238
OK?. So...

19:21.280 --> 19:22.759
Juniper.

19:22.800 --> 19:24.313
Yes!

19:24.360 --> 19:25.759
Frankie.

19:28.520 --> 19:30.476
Hannah.

19:30.520 --> 19:32.351
And Asif.

19:32.400 --> 19:35.073
Yeah! Thank you.

19:37.720 --> 19:42.350
Everyone else, thanks for your time
and all the best for the future.

19:42.400 --> 19:43.753
OK, let's crack on with round two.

19:43.800 --> 19:46.439
Oh, and don't forget your feedback.

19:50.080 --> 19:51.638
Feedback.

19:51.680 --> 19:53.033
Some feedback. Oh!

19:53.080 --> 19:55.469
Feedback, yeah.

19:55.520 --> 19:56.555
Thanks.

19:56.600 --> 19:59.672
Because what I need
in the wake of this soul crushing

19:59.720 --> 20:01.950
and, frankly, heartbreaking failure
is a big list of what's wrong with me.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.117
Yes, please, BBC 6 Music.
While you're at it,

20:05.160 --> 20:08.391
why don't you cut my throat and ask
if I mind if you stamp on my head?.

20:09.640 --> 20:11.198
Your moustache is horrid, by the way.

20:11.240 --> 20:12.719
There's my "feedback" for you.

20:12.760 --> 20:14.557
How do you like it?.

20:14.600 --> 20:16.272
Feedback's optional.

20:16.320 --> 20:17.833
Thanks. Thank you.

20:21.280 --> 20:22.679
- To freedom.
- Yeah.

20:24.080 --> 20:27.277
Except I don't wanna be free.
I wanna be an intern at BBC 6 Music.

20:27.320 --> 20:29.595
And instead, I get fucking feedback.

20:29.640 --> 20:33.030
Knutsford, I think you're taking this
all too much to heart.

20:33.080 --> 20:34.433
What did the feedback say?.

20:34.480 --> 20:37.790
- I don't know, I didn't take it.
- You didn't take it?.

20:37.840 --> 20:40.513
When someone rejects you, the last thing
you want is a list of reasons.

20:40.560 --> 20:43.358
I just thought it might be useful
for nex time.

20:43.400 --> 20:44.753
If you get another interview.

20:45.800 --> 20:49.952
Where the fuck is Howard?.
I texed him and told him to meet us here.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.753
- I'll tex him again.
- I should've taken the feedback.

20:52.800 --> 20:55.268
- I should've read what they had to say...
- (PHONE CHlMES)

20:55.320 --> 20:56.992
...so I could be better nex time.

20:57.040 --> 20:58.234
Oh, shit!

20:58.280 --> 21:01.238
Oh, shit. Howard's phone.

21:03.640 --> 21:05.949
Thanks to the invention
of the hand-held device,

21:06.000 --> 21:09.629
I don't have one useful
telephone number memorised.

21:09.680 --> 21:11.716
And all I can think to do
is call the operator

21:11.760 --> 21:14.672
and speak to John at Ordnance Survey,
ask for his help, but...

21:14.720 --> 21:18.110
how can I admit to the man
at Ordnance Survey that I'm lost?.

21:18.160 --> 21:19.718
I mean, look at me.

21:19.760 --> 21:21.990
First morning in the capital
and I'm already destitute.

21:25.320 --> 21:28.835
Rita, this may sound strange, but...

21:28.880 --> 21:30.950
can you spare me some change?.

21:32.560 --> 21:35.472
You came all the way to London
just to commit interview suicide?.

21:35.520 --> 21:36.794
Fuck Tomothy.

21:36.840 --> 21:38.273
I went and did his stupid little interview

21:38.320 --> 21:41.312
and now he needs to let go of my balls.

21:41.360 --> 21:44.955
And if he doesn't let go of my balls,
I'm gonna tell him to suck on my balls.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.434
I did his stupid interview.

21:47.480 --> 21:50.233
He didn't say how well I had to do it.

21:50.280 --> 21:53.955
I'm my own man.
I will not be dictated to by my brother.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.309
- I shall do as I wish.
- Like what?.

21:56.360 --> 21:59.272
- Dunno. Something amazing.
- For example?.

21:59.320 --> 22:02.437
For example, think of something
amazing to do and then do it...

22:02.480 --> 22:03.833
amazingly.

22:03.880 --> 22:05.996
You're not worried?. At all?.

22:06.040 --> 22:09.237
I'm not worried.
(SCOFFS) Why would I be worried?.

22:09.280 --> 22:12.192
And even if I was worried,
I wouldn't allow myself to feel worried,

22:12.240 --> 22:15.152
because feelings of weakness
only make other people uncomfortable.

22:15.200 --> 22:17.760
If one boy cries, we all want to cry.

22:17.800 --> 22:20.678
And since we all want to cry,
but we also don't want to cry,

22:20.720 --> 22:23.632
we need to beat the boy who's crying
to stop him from crying.

22:23.680 --> 22:24.999
You see?.

22:25.040 --> 22:26.837
Oh.

22:26.880 --> 22:28.871
- (PHONE RlNGS AND VlBRATES)
- Oh, shit. Tomothy.

22:30.800 --> 22:31.835
Shit.

22:32.800 --> 22:34.995
TOMOTHY: Jonathan, it's your brother.

22:35.040 --> 22:39.158
I've just had a phone call from Magda.
She told me what you did, you little shit.

22:39.200 --> 22:41.156
D'you really think
you're gonna get away with this?.

22:41.200 --> 22:43.191
Isn't this when you get out there
and tell him to suck your...?.

22:43.240 --> 22:44.559
Shh.

22:44.600 --> 22:46.795
Daddy's turning in his grave, JP.

22:46.840 --> 22:48.910
Squirming in his fucking grave.

22:48.960 --> 22:53.192
If he wasn't already dead,
he'd probably die of shame.

22:53.240 --> 22:56.277
Just call me back straightaway,
or I'm calling Mummy.

23:00.040 --> 23:02.270
Paz tells me you're joining us.

23:02.320 --> 23:03.833
Yeah.

23:03.880 --> 23:06.917
Need to get away for a while,
go off-grid for a bit.

23:06.960 --> 23:08.518
Yeah.

23:08.560 --> 23:10.312
I know what you mean.

23:10.360 --> 23:13.716
Best decision I ever made,
escaping all that shit.

23:13.760 --> 23:17.036
- Job?. Mortgage?.
- You just don't need it.

23:17.080 --> 23:18.877
Wife?. Two kids?.

23:18.920 --> 23:20.512
Had the lot.

23:20.560 --> 23:23.074
It weighs on you.

23:23.120 --> 23:25.839
You know, that kind of baggage.

23:25.880 --> 23:27.518
Out here,

23:27.560 --> 23:30.233
no way they can track me down.

23:30.280 --> 23:32.714
Haven't even got a phone. It's brilliant.

23:44.160 --> 23:45.957
(PHONE RlNGS)

23:48.200 --> 23:50.589
Hello, Ordnance Survey, John speaking.
How can I help?.

23:50.640 --> 23:53.313
Hi, John, it's Howard here.

23:53.360 --> 23:55.396
- I'm sorry?.
- Howard McGregor.

23:55.440 --> 23:57.874
We've been exchanging e-mails
about my potential application

23:57.920 --> 23:59.672
for a job at your company.

23:59.720 --> 24:01.676
Howard, of course. How can I help?.

24:01.720 --> 24:06.430
I'm in London with no phone,
no money, no access to GPS,

24:06.480 --> 24:10.871
and my only piece of navigational
equipment is the old-fashioned compass.

24:10.920 --> 24:13.957
I was wondering
if you might be able to help me.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.558
Go on.

24:25.040 --> 24:26.678
(# CAN: Mother Sky)

24:32.280 --> 24:33.349
Oh...

24:33.400 --> 24:37.393
Sorry, I changed my mind.
I want my feedback.

24:37.440 --> 24:40.273
At the time, I didn't wanna know
my faults, but now I do.

24:40.320 --> 24:43.835
I mean, I already know one of my faults
was not wanting to know my faults.

24:43.880 --> 24:47.429
- But... I'm ready now.
- You were at the workshop?.

24:47.480 --> 24:48.549
- That's right.
- Yeah, I'm sorry,

24:48.600 --> 24:50.431
I think we put all the unwanted feedback
in the bin.

24:50.480 --> 24:52.755
- Oh.
- What was your name again?.

24:52.800 --> 24:55.155
Er, Kingsley Owen.
Could you just maybe...

24:55.200 --> 24:56.838
maybe just tell me what it was

24:56.880 --> 25:00.759
- so I can be better nex time?.
- Right, Kingsley.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.870
Yeah, what did we say about you?.

25:02.920 --> 25:04.592
Er...

25:04.640 --> 25:07.029
Ooh, was it, maybe, um...

25:07.080 --> 25:08.433
Some of my opinions were half-baked?.

25:08.480 --> 25:09.799
- Er...
- Did you find me pretentious?.

25:09.840 --> 25:12.400
Or annoying?.
My personality can be grating?.

25:12.440 --> 25:14.908
- Well...
- I'm inauthentic, maybe?.

25:14.960 --> 25:18.669
I'm boring?. Um...
Oh, no, wait. Um, I'm a people-pleaser.

25:21.360 --> 25:22.918
I'm indecisive?.

25:22.960 --> 25:25.269
- Sorry, were you in today or yesterday?.
- Um...

25:25.320 --> 25:28.232
Well, today.
It was... It was... It was today.

25:28.280 --> 25:31.078
Right, it's just we've been running these
workshops all week, I'm ever so sorry.

25:31.120 --> 25:32.917
Um...

25:35.200 --> 25:38.317
I'm the guy who listens to I'm Ready by
Royal Trux when he gets fucked up on Jack,

25:38.360 --> 25:39.998
- but then...
- Right, yes!

25:40.040 --> 25:41.951
Now I remember, yeah.

25:42.000 --> 25:45.913
Yeah, I asked what music you liked and...
you were talking for about half an hour

25:45.960 --> 25:48.520
and I couldn't really work out
what your answer was.

25:48.560 --> 25:50.630
It was all, like,
"Oh, I don't really believe in genres."

25:50.680 --> 25:53.513
But, you know, all I wanted to know was...

25:53.560 --> 25:56.597
d'you like U2 or do you not?.

25:59.480 --> 26:01.471
I'm sorry,
I don't really understand the question.

26:05.440 --> 26:09.797
Cut golf, cut fencing, cut fucking
Juggle Soc, OK, Nas, I don't care.

26:09.840 --> 26:11.831
Just do it.

26:13.440 --> 26:17.149
You know the radio waves from that thing
are being absorbed by your brain?.

26:17.200 --> 26:19.475
It's OK, I don't mind.

26:19.520 --> 26:20.999
Is that...?.

26:21.040 --> 26:22.917
- Are you doing your poetry?.
- Yeah.

26:22.960 --> 26:26.396
You can write better poems in the sand
than in any of your fucking books.

26:26.440 --> 26:29.637
I've written over 1,000 poems in the sand.

26:29.680 --> 26:32.638
I've written a whole screenplay
in the sand.

26:32.680 --> 26:36.719
- Awesome.
- And once they're finished...

26:37.880 --> 26:39.552
... no-one will ever read them.

26:39.600 --> 26:42.751
- Right, and that's good, is it?.
- Right, so, are we ready to begin?.

26:42.800 --> 26:43.835
JOSlE: Yes.

26:43.880 --> 26:45.757
In the words of Shirley Bassey, Pink

26:45.800 --> 26:48.519
and Welsh hero Rhydian Roberts
from The X Factor,

26:48.560 --> 26:51.154
- let's get this party started.
- PAZ: Wait.

26:51.200 --> 26:54.272
Before you drink,
you must cleanse the space.

26:54.320 --> 26:56.470
Speak your truth.

26:56.520 --> 26:59.910
If you don't,
you can have a very, very bad trip.

26:59.960 --> 27:05.671
I once hallucinated 1,000 Jabba the Hutts
crawling out of my eye sockets

27:05.720 --> 27:07.631
and ejaculating onto my breasts.

27:07.680 --> 27:10.069
Yeah?.

27:10.120 --> 27:15.148
So, unless you want that, get any little
grudges, any secrets, out in the open.

27:16.200 --> 27:20.637
Cos once you drink this stuff,
it is all coming out, one way or another.

27:20.680 --> 27:22.750
Ring this bell when you're ready.

27:22.800 --> 27:25.109
I'll come and pour the eraldaketa.

27:28.960 --> 27:30.473
Yeah.

27:30.520 --> 27:31.839
Mm-hm.

27:32.880 --> 27:36.077
Mm-hm. Yes, thank you.

27:36.120 --> 27:37.439
Howard...

27:37.480 --> 27:39.710
Anyone who can find their way to HQ

27:39.760 --> 27:42.035
using nothing more
than latitudinal coordinates

27:42.080 --> 27:43.877
and an old-fashioned compass

27:43.920 --> 27:48.038
might be just the kind of candidate
we're looking for here at Ordnance Survey.

27:48.080 --> 27:51.629
And especially one
with such great taste in knitwear.

27:51.680 --> 27:55.753
Well, now you've got me, are there
any questions you'd like to ask me?.

27:55.800 --> 27:58.155
Well...

27:58.200 --> 27:59.599
actually,

27:59.640 --> 28:04.509
I wanted to ask if you could see your way
to lending me £29 in cash?.

28:05.600 --> 28:06.794
You what?.

28:06.840 --> 28:10.150
That is the peak-time fare
from London to Manchester

28:10.200 --> 28:13.317
without which, unless I manage
to meet up with my friends,

28:13.360 --> 28:14.998
I won't be able to make it home.

28:15.040 --> 28:18.077
I would, of course, repay you.

28:19.880 --> 28:21.154
Perhaps...

28:22.360 --> 28:24.032
...at my interview.

28:26.680 --> 28:29.911
And, yes, I should have checked
what murderball was,

28:29.960 --> 28:36.399
but I've been really busy with Fulbright
and my dissertation and the Shawcross.

28:36.440 --> 28:38.635
And what have I learned?.

28:38.680 --> 28:40.477
That I can't trust my staff.

28:40.520 --> 28:45.150
And I guess I'm also feeling really bad
because I haven't read any good poems

28:45.200 --> 28:48.954
and I need to find one
to send to Jeanette Winterson.

28:50.320 --> 28:53.630
(SlGHS) But I'll get round to it
after we've finished this.

28:53.680 --> 28:56.035
Er, OK, I think I'm done.

28:57.400 --> 28:58.389
Jobbo?.

28:59.440 --> 29:01.192
You got something?.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.356
OK, so, um...

29:05.080 --> 29:07.799
I was hoping to find a better time
to talk about this,

29:07.840 --> 29:11.799
but I think I need to say it now because
I'm quite afraid of having a bad trip.

29:11.840 --> 29:17.039
Yeah, no big deal, but l...
woke up yesterday morning

29:17.080 --> 29:21.756
and it turns out
that I had had sex with JP.

29:21.800 --> 29:23.199
Again.

29:25.840 --> 29:27.193
You...

29:27.240 --> 29:30.038
We've actually, um...

29:30.080 --> 29:32.753
done it quite a few times recently,
regularly.

29:32.800 --> 29:35.917
So...yeah.

29:40.040 --> 29:41.439
OK.

29:41.480 --> 29:45.155
There's no need to look at me like that,
all right, Mrs Judge and Mrs Judgey.

29:45.200 --> 29:48.556
OK?. I'm not going out with him.
It's just sex.

29:48.600 --> 29:50.511
Jobbo is very much like Vod
in that respect.

29:50.560 --> 29:54.314
I just use men and I dump 'em
when I'm through with 'em.

29:54.360 --> 29:55.793
How's that like me?.

29:55.840 --> 29:57.319
You know what I mean.

29:57.360 --> 29:59.874
I don't give a shit
about anyone else's feelings.

29:59.920 --> 30:03.037
I just chuck people away
whenever I decide to move on.

30:04.200 --> 30:06.191
OK.

30:06.240 --> 30:07.958
Er... Oh, I've got one.

30:09.360 --> 30:11.271
- I fucked JP.
- What?.!

30:11.320 --> 30:13.675
- Really?.
- Yeah.

30:13.720 --> 30:15.358
No.

30:15.400 --> 30:16.833
Or was it the other one?.

30:16.880 --> 30:18.472
Maybe it was another house.

30:18.520 --> 30:21.273
When we all went to Liverpool
on that night.

30:21.320 --> 30:23.515
- We've never been to Liverpool.
- Oh, yeah.

30:23.560 --> 30:26.028
No, I didn't wanna fuck JP.

30:26.080 --> 30:27.354
So, I didn't.

30:27.400 --> 30:29.516
Right, take this seriously.

30:29.560 --> 30:31.357
We're meant to be speaking our truth.

30:31.400 --> 30:33.550
All right. Here's one.

30:33.600 --> 30:34.999
I don't like Jobbo.

30:35.040 --> 30:37.793
- I think Jobbo's a wanker.
- What?.!

30:37.840 --> 30:41.992
How can you not like Jobbo
when she's so clearly based on you?.

30:42.040 --> 30:43.439
I knew it.

30:44.640 --> 30:47.837
- How is Jobbo like me?.
- I'm just cruising through life,

30:47.880 --> 30:50.917
never facing up to any of the consequences
of my actions.

30:50.960 --> 30:52.518
I'm so fucking cool, it hurts.

30:52.560 --> 30:54.676
Well, no, you're not. And neither am l.

30:54.720 --> 30:57.234
- Yes, you are.
- Am I like that, Oregon?.

30:57.280 --> 31:00.352
- No.
- Vod, you've nearly finished uni

31:00.400 --> 31:02.595
and you're about to fuck off
and live on some commune.

31:02.640 --> 31:05.438
- You're doing what?.
- Yeah, she's planning to move here.

31:05.480 --> 31:07.198
At least I'm not shagging JP.

31:07.240 --> 31:08.878
I can't believe
you're planning to move here.

31:08.920 --> 31:10.239
I knew you were judging me.

31:10.280 --> 31:12.748
How dare you,
after everything you've done?.

31:12.800 --> 31:14.677
OK, yes,

31:14.720 --> 31:16.597
it's disgusting.

31:16.640 --> 31:19.200
Yes, it's not very fair on Kingsley.

31:19.240 --> 31:21.708
Yes, it's sneaky to do it
behind my friends' backs.

31:21.760 --> 31:26.117
But maybe, if my friends weren't being
such fucking self-important twats,

31:26.160 --> 31:28.594
then maybe I wouldn't have done it
in the first place.

31:28.640 --> 31:31.438
"Oh, oh, we're third years,
we're so important."

31:31.480 --> 31:35.155
"Oh, no, I can't come for a pint with you,
Josie. I'm union president."

31:35.200 --> 31:37.839
"Oh, no, I can't.
I've gotta write my dissertation."

31:37.880 --> 31:42.476
"We don't care about Josie
and her stupid, second year, immature

31:42.520 --> 31:46.069
"wanting to hang out
and do fun stuff bullshit."

31:46.120 --> 31:50.113
So, now she's lonely
and she's accidentally

31:50.160 --> 31:52.720
had quite a lot of sex with JP.

31:52.760 --> 31:54.637
But that could happen to anyone.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.796
One time you asked me
to go for a pint with you

31:56.840 --> 31:58.478
because you said everybody else was busy.

31:58.520 --> 32:00.033
Which proves my point.

32:00.080 --> 32:01.433
Do you think I've had a pint with Oregon?.

32:01.480 --> 32:03.948
If I wanna see Oregon,
I have to make a fucking appointment.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.309
You don't have to make an appointment.

32:06.360 --> 32:08.157
OK, so you've got time
to go for a pint with Oregon...

32:08.200 --> 32:09.792
Oregon is my best mate, Josie.

32:09.840 --> 32:11.478
And I hardly see her any more.

32:11.520 --> 32:13.272
Oh, my God. This is so unfair.

32:13.320 --> 32:16.790
I'm applying to be a Fulbright scholar.
I'm union president.

32:16.840 --> 32:18.558
BOTH: (MOCKlNGLY) "I'm union president."

32:18.600 --> 32:20.158
Oh, fuck you.

32:20.200 --> 32:21.679
You're both selfish,

32:21.720 --> 32:23.153
you're both self-centred,

32:23.200 --> 32:26.397
and I'm shagging JP
and you're both responsible.

32:27.400 --> 32:30.392
You are really fucking me off now, Josie.

32:30.440 --> 32:33.989
Yeah, well, if you cared about any of us,
Vod, then you'd come back to Manchester,

32:34.040 --> 32:36.474
Iike a proper friend,
and you'd finish uni.

32:36.520 --> 32:39.239
But, no, you don't give a shit,
so you're just dropping out.

32:39.280 --> 32:41.510
You wanna shut your fucking mouth
right now before I lose my temper.

32:41.560 --> 32:43.915
D'you think Jobbo's scared of you?.
Because she's not.

32:43.960 --> 32:45.678
- Maybe she should be.
- Maybe she's not.

32:47.040 --> 32:49.713
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to. I'm really...

32:51.160 --> 32:53.720
- OREGON: Stop it!
- VOD: I'm gonna kill you!

32:53.760 --> 32:55.352
OREGON: Josie, stop it. Ah!

32:56.680 --> 32:57.669
Ow!

32:58.840 --> 33:00.034
VOD: Rrrgh!

33:04.280 --> 33:07.431
You know, I worked really hard
to get to Manchester, Josie.

33:07.480 --> 33:11.871
I worked my factory job in the day
and did an access course at night,

33:11.920 --> 33:15.515
and lived on fucking beans
so I could afford our rent near college.

33:15.560 --> 33:17.596
And now I'm about...

33:17.640 --> 33:19.358
£5 billion in debt.

33:19.400 --> 33:20.833
And guess what?.

33:20.880 --> 33:23.599
I don't have Mummy and Daddy
to come and bail me out. I'm on my own.

33:23.640 --> 33:26.871
So, I might have fucked about a bit
these past three years,

33:26.920 --> 33:31.232
but if you think that means I don't
give a shit then you don't know me.

33:31.280 --> 33:33.316
Here's your fucking truth.

33:36.760 --> 33:37.954
What are we gonna do?.

33:38.000 --> 33:41.834
We can't just hang around London
on the off-chance that we bump into him.

33:41.880 --> 33:45.077
I knew we should have put a tag on him.
"Please look after this Howard."

33:45.120 --> 33:48.237
- We've gotta get on the coach.
- Yeah.

33:48.280 --> 33:53.035
Just hope he finds his way back,
like a big, bearded homing pigeon.

33:53.080 --> 33:54.308
Wait.

33:55.360 --> 33:56.429
Look.

33:59.200 --> 34:00.428
Howard!

34:02.840 --> 34:04.956
We've found you.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.956
The nex time we go on a trip

34:07.000 --> 34:10.879
and I propose arranging a safe
meeting point in case of nuclear attack,

34:10.920 --> 34:14.071
- I suggest you take me seriously.
- Oh, fuck it.

34:15.639 --> 34:17.358
Thank God you're safe.

34:22.199 --> 34:24.315
It's not that bad, you know.

34:24.360 --> 34:26.748
A solid 2:2. Borderline 2:1.

34:26.800 --> 34:28.279
A 2:1?.

34:28.320 --> 34:30.469
It's not actually that hard to get a 2:1.

34:30.520 --> 34:32.795
You basically just have to hand stuff in.

34:32.840 --> 34:35.513
I don't want a 2:1. I want a first.

34:35.560 --> 34:36.754
Do you?.

34:36.800 --> 34:39.030
Yeah.

34:39.080 --> 34:41.799
I've always wanted a first.

34:41.840 --> 34:46.833
Just something about a first
just appeals to me more than a 2:1.

34:46.880 --> 34:49.110
Know what I mean?.

34:49.159 --> 34:50.592
Kind of.

34:50.639 --> 34:51.958
Let me get this straight.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.833
You either want a first
or you want to leave civilisation?.

34:57.200 --> 34:58.519
Yeah.

35:00.480 --> 35:03.950
If we leave now, we can still make it back
in time for you to hand this in.

35:07.960 --> 35:09.029
Yeah, OK.

35:12.480 --> 35:15.233
I'm killing Jobbo!

35:28.240 --> 35:29.559
HOWARD: Just to check...

35:30.640 --> 35:33.473
Begging a future employer for bus fare...

35:33.520 --> 35:38.196
Impressively nonchalant
or incredibly bad first impression?.

35:39.400 --> 35:40.799
(PHONE RlNGS AND VlBRATES)

35:43.360 --> 35:44.588
Mummy?.

35:44.640 --> 35:46.153
Have you spoken to Tomothy?.

35:46.200 --> 35:48.111
Tomothy?. No, he hasn't called me.

35:48.160 --> 35:49.388
Why?.

35:49.440 --> 35:51.396
What the bloody hell have you done?.

35:51.440 --> 35:53.635
Well, I don't know
what he's talking about, Mummy.

35:53.680 --> 35:56.911
JOSlE: "And so I said, 'Could I be dead

35:56.960 --> 35:59.155
" 'Or should I be in Maidenhead??' "

35:59.200 --> 36:00.428
BOTH: Shit.

36:03.200 --> 36:06.158
"Let me be alone till now

36:06.200 --> 36:08.077
- "l..."
- Shit.

36:08.120 --> 36:10.759
"Whose woods these are, I think I know

36:10.800 --> 36:13.234
"His house is in the village, though."

36:13.280 --> 36:14.315
ALL: Shit.

36:15.480 --> 36:17.710
- ALL: Shit.
- VOD: Shit.

36:17.760 --> 36:19.591
ALL: Shit.

36:19.640 --> 36:21.153
ALL: Shit!

36:21.200 --> 36:25.432
#...No, I don't listen
to their wasted lines

36:25.480 --> 36:27.710
# Got my eyes wide open

36:27.760 --> 36:29.876
# And I see the signs

36:29.920 --> 36:34.436
# But they don't know about us

36:34.480 --> 36:38.871
# And they've never heard of love

36:38.920 --> 36:42.959
- # Doo doo-doo-doo
- # Why should it matter to us

36:43.000 --> 36:47.232
# If they don 't approve?.

36:47.280 --> 36:49.077
# Doo doo-doo-doo

36:49.120 --> 36:51.588
# We should just take our chances

36:51.640 --> 36:54.791
# While we've got nothing to lose... #

36:55.305 --> 37:01.540
