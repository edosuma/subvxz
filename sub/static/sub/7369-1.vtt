00:58.100 --> 01:01.185
Of course,
women have always been a vital link...

01:01.270 --> 01:04.397
in the lifeline
that supplies combat units.

01:04.480 --> 01:06.733
The last few years have brought
real progress...

01:06.817 --> 01:10.194
in the interests of women in
all aspects of naval service.

01:10.279 --> 01:14.365
What's more, the Navy has instituted
special sensitivity courses...

01:14.450 --> 01:17.577
for all its male recruits,
demonstrating even more progress–—

01:17.661 --> 01:19.954
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Mr. Hayes.

01:20.038 --> 01:23.916
If a cannibal used a knife and fork,
would you call that progress too?

01:26.378 --> 01:30.131
Well, perhaps, if I could just finish,
Madame Chairman, your questions–—

01:30.215 --> 01:32.925
Oh, I'm just an old dame
without much time left...

01:33.010 --> 01:35.803
so you'll pardon me
if I jump right in here.

01:35.888 --> 01:40.183
I'm deeply concerned over the Navy's
seemingly incontrovertible attitude...

01:40.267 --> 01:43.311
toward women in the military.

01:43.395 --> 01:46.022
Case in point: the Lark Report.

01:49.026 --> 01:51.944
Uh, Madame Chairman, this is
an internal document of the U.S. Navy.

01:52.029 --> 01:56.699
The Navy's analysis of that F-14 crash
at Coronado last year.

01:56.784 --> 01:59.494
Female aviator,
it just so happens.

01:59.578 --> 02:02.997
You were party to this report.
Am I right?

02:03.081 --> 02:06.000
I am really not prepared
to go into an in-depth–—

02:06.084 --> 02:09.836
If you are vying for the office
of the Secretary of the Navy, Mr. Hayes...

02:09.922 --> 02:11.964
I'd like to think
you were prepared for anything.

02:13.801 --> 02:16.052
Especially if you're lookin'
for my confirmation.

02:16.136 --> 02:20.556
I'm struck by the ill-spirited
tenor of your report:

02:20.641 --> 02:22.809
degrading remarks
by other aviators...

02:22.893 --> 02:26.813
innuendo about her performance
in unrelated situations.

02:26.897 --> 02:30.566
There's even a reference here to
her sexual activity the weekend prior.

02:30.651 --> 02:34.195
These are not
unrelated circumstances.

02:34.279 --> 02:36.197
In my seven years
on this committee...

02:36.281 --> 02:39.742
I have never seen a downed aviator
treated like this, never.

02:41.328 --> 02:44.831
I'm deeply disturbed
by this report, Mr. Hayes.

02:44.915 --> 02:48.376
Not just what it bodes
for the future of women in the Navy...

02:50.254 --> 02:52.338
but your future as well.

02:52.422 --> 02:56.467
Do you expect to take criticism
for using this confirmation hearing...

02:56.552 --> 02:58.678
as a pulpit
for women's rights?

02:58.762 --> 03:01.764
Look, nearly one-quarter of
all jobs in the U.S. military...

03:01.849 --> 03:05.017
are still to this day off-limits
to women, and that has gotta change!

03:05.102 --> 03:09.021
What about those that say women aren't
suited for all jobs, they're physically weaker?

03:09.106 --> 03:11.023
How strong do you have to be
to pull a trigger?

03:11.108 --> 03:14.235
That was quick.
Yeah, she did great.

03:14.319 --> 03:16.863
Are you kidding?
She's always great.

03:16.947 --> 03:18.698
Private meeting.
That's what we want.

03:18.782 --> 03:22.702
Are you worried about the next round
of base closures, Senator?

03:22.786 --> 03:25.788
- As long as it doesn't affect me.
- Defense boys already called.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.790
They want
a private meeting with you.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.917
I'll act surprised.

03:36.800 --> 03:41.137
Senator, this is a contingency program
for 100 per cent integration.

03:42.681 --> 03:45.308
If female candidates measure e up
in a series of test cases...

03:45.392 --> 03:50.313
the D.O.D. will support full
integration within three year's time.

03:50.397 --> 03:53.316
We get our man. You get
your gender -blind Navy, Senator.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.651
Surely you’re e not gonna
balk at that.

03:55.736 --> 03:58.070
I have to pick
the test cases.

03:58.155 --> 04:00.323
The Navy'll want approval
over the women.

04:00.407 --> 04:03.242
- So I'll approve their approval.
- Come on, Senator.

04:04.536 --> 04:07.914
Let's concentrate on the steak
and not the peas.

04:07.998 --> 04:11.125
If women measure e up to the men, they've
got the job. That's what's on the table.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.671
You're not having
second thoughts, are you?

04:23.013 --> 04:25.848
- Well, Doug?
- Congratulations, Mr. Secretary.

04:25.933 --> 04:28.267
So, what program?

04:28.352 --> 04:31.646
I'd go C.R.T.
Combined Reconnaissance Team.

04:31.730 --> 04:34.106
SEALS.
Sixty per cent dropout r ate.

04:34.191 --> 04:36.651
No woman's gonna last a week.
I don't care who she is.

04:36.735 --> 04:39.111
Then I suggest
we start there.

04:39.196 --> 04:41.280
Good work.

04:42.574 --> 04:44.492
Hostile activity.
Mined area.

04:44.576 --> 04:47.161
I say again:
hostile activity, mined area.

04:47.245 --> 04:50.122
Maintaining holding action.

04:50.207 --> 04:52.124
Carrying one wounded.

04:52.209 --> 04:55.878
Extracting to new location
secondary P.Z. Over.

04:55.963 --> 04:58.506
Bravo Six, this is Avalanche.

04:58.590 --> 05:00.633
Negative
on secondary rendezvous.

05:00.717 --> 05:04.512
Strongly suggest new location.
Over.

05:04.596 --> 05:07.723
Stand by, Avalanche.
Will consult team leader.

05:10.102 --> 05:12.853
- Bravo Six.
- Go to sea level.

05:12.938 --> 05:15.815
Say again your last.
Over.

05:15.899 --> 05:19.568
Bravo Six, this is Avalanche.

05:22.072 --> 05:24.240
Bravo Six.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.242
- We've lost the horizon.
- Bravo Six.

05:26.326 --> 05:29.537
- You didn't account for that?
- Yes, sir, we did...

05:29.621 --> 05:32.206
but we didn't count on the SEAL unit
being delayed for five hours...

05:32.290 --> 05:34.709
and then exfiltrating
this close to this high terrain.

05:34.793 --> 05:39.005
But Keyhole-5 will be L.O.S.
in 18 minutes, sir.

05:39.089 --> 05:41.507
Launch base will need
that much time to key their gear.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.843
Advise launch base
accordingly, Goldstein. Now.

05:43.927 --> 05:46.220
Sir, I'd recommend against it.
These are skilled operators.

05:46.304 --> 05:49.765
They've grasped their problem by now and
will take action to get back on-line.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.184
It’s just a glitch
in the net changeover, sir.

05:52.269 --> 05:54.061
I'll have it ironed out
momentarily.

05:54.146 --> 05:57.356
Advise launch base,
Goldstein.

05:57.441 --> 06:00.026
Something to add,
Lieutenant?

06:00.110 --> 06:04.238
If we keep the primary satellite, the unit can
negotiate its way down to this plateau here.

06:04.322 --> 06:06.282
Reestablish comms.
It's a clear shot.

06:06.366 --> 06:09.910
What about those two areas inland?
That's closer to their position.

06:09.995 --> 06:12.038
But that's behind them.

06:12.122 --> 06:14.206
They'll wanna keep moving
seaward, sir, yet find a spot...

06:14.291 --> 06:16.375
that gives 'em the line of sight
on the satellite.

06:16.460 --> 06:19.045
This plateau here.
That's where I'd head, sir.

06:19.129 --> 06:23.716
Last I checked, you were a topographic
analyst, not an operations specialist.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.385
- Why don't you just let it–—
- If they have wounded...

06:26.470 --> 06:28.596
they might be inclined
to stay put.

06:28.680 --> 06:30.973
Wait till the new bird
comes into L.O.S.

06:31.058 --> 06:34.143
But they also know the tides are
slipping out under their recovery sub.

06:34.227 --> 06:37.897
They'll hump their wounded out. They'll
reach this plateau in ten minutes.

06:37.981 --> 06:40.066
Make that nine now.

06:40.150 --> 06:43.235
We can't switch the net, sir.
We'll be listening for them...

06:43.320 --> 06:46.572
on the wrong channel
with the wrong crypto.

06:48.992 --> 06:52.244
Give it exactly nine minutes.

07:16.061 --> 07:18.437
Okay, let's see
what the cat dragged in.

07:18.522 --> 07:20.523
They've preapproved
all these candidates.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.525
Top scores, marksmanship.

07:22.609 --> 07:26.445
Distance runner. Took fifth place
in some intra-service marathon. Age 27.

07:26.530 --> 07:29.949
Perfect, till they do
a chromosome check.

07:30.033 --> 07:32.618
Some impressive
fitness reps here.

07:32.702 --> 07:36.539
Holder of several records
for female power-lifting.

07:36.623 --> 07:39.208
Is this the face you want to see
on the cover of Newsweek?

07:39.292 --> 07:41.794
She looks like the wife
of a Russian beet farmer.

07:41.878 --> 07:43.796
I like this one.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.966
Triathlon, winter sports,
Olympic contender...

07:47.050 --> 07:49.468
winner of the Arlie Burke
essay contest, works Intel.

07:49.553 --> 07:54.181
- Too much of a think-tank soldier.
- No, no, show me, show me.

07:59.354 --> 08:02.815
Well, this really is
top drawer...

08:02.899 --> 08:06.026
with silk stockings inside.

08:09.447 --> 08:12.324
- We've waited about as long as we dare.
- Do it.

08:12.409 --> 08:14.410
Change the net.

08:14.494 --> 08:17.496
Launch base,
this is N.I.C. control.

08:17.581 --> 08:21.167
We're going to conduct
a net changeover...

08:21.251 --> 08:24.211
to Keyhole-5 at
the following coordinates.

08:24.296 --> 08:26.380
This is Bravo Six.
Still got six heartbeats here...

08:26.464 --> 08:28.507
holding on some kind of plateau.

08:28.592 --> 08:32.886
I say again, six passengers
looking for a ride home.

08:32.971 --> 08:35.222
- We're good to go.
- Belay my last.

08:35.307 --> 08:40.936
Copy that. Maintain perimeter.
Advise further hostile status.

08:48.945 --> 08:50.905
- That was good headwork, Lieutenant.
- Well, thank you, sir.

08:50.989 --> 08:53.324
I'm glad we could get
involved and do some good.

08:53.408 --> 08:57.036
Now the problem is,
Intel officers don't get involved.

08:57.120 --> 09:00.331
We monitor, analyze.

09:00.415 --> 09:03.042
You need to learn
the fine art of detachment, Lieutenant.

09:03.126 --> 09:05.711
Excuse me, there's a call
from the Sec Nav's office.

09:05.795 --> 09:07.546
- I'll take it inside.
- No, sir, excuse me.

09:07.631 --> 09:09.715
Lieutenant O'Neil,
the call's for you.

09:09.799 --> 09:12.259
I'll take it inside.

09:14.137 --> 09:17.973
Thanks for holding.
I'll put you through.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.084
I'm thinking about redoing
the place.

09:45.168 --> 09:48.337
It's beginning to remind me
of an old whorehouse over the years.

09:48.421 --> 09:51.674
- Good evening, ma'am.
- Good evening, Lieutenant.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.676
Ma'am, may I ask
what this is regarding?

09:53.760 --> 09:56.178
- Didn't they tell you?
- No, ma'am.

09:56.263 --> 09:59.181
Well, this'll be a toot.
You read, I'll pour.

10:21.246 --> 10:23.998
It's jus t a test case, Jordan...

10:24.082 --> 10:27.042
but if things work out,
if you can go the distance...

10:27.127 --> 10:32.214
it could well change the military's
official policy on women in combat.

10:32.299 --> 10:36.051
Or, actually,
its official non-policy.

10:37.929 --> 10:39.847
Begging your pardon,
Senator...

10:39.931 --> 10:43.183
but you do understand this
involves SEAL training?

10:43.268 --> 10:45.978
I do.
I also understand...

10:46.062 --> 10:49.481
that you applied for active duty
during the Gulf War and got turned down.

10:49.566 --> 10:53.569
Yes, ma'am, there was an Intel slot
available aboard the U.S.S. Polk...

10:53.653 --> 10:57.156
but they told me that submarines
had no bathroom facilities for women.

10:57.240 --> 11:00.826
- Did that piss you off?
- Yes, ma'am, it did.

11:00.910 --> 11:04.079
Good. I like pissed off.

11:06.124 --> 11:09.418
- Sit down, Lieutenant.
- Yes, ma'am.

11:15.967 --> 11:18.552
Have you got a man?

11:18.636 --> 11:21.430
- Ma'am?
- At home?

11:21.514 --> 11:25.517
Fiancé. Steady beau. You know,
some kind of solid heterosexual.

11:25.602 --> 11:29.605
I hate askin', but I don't want
this thing blowin' up in our faces...

11:29.689 --> 11:31.857
if you happen to be battin'
for the other side.

11:31.941 --> 11:34.610
Yes, ma'am, there's someone.

11:34.694 --> 11:37.404
Well, wonderful.

11:41.868 --> 11:45.537
Honey, come on'. I survived jump school,
dive school and three brothers.

11:45.622 --> 11:47.539
I think I can take care
of myself '.

11:47.624 --> 11:50.751
The only thing that scares me
are the sexual politics.

11:50.835 --> 11:54.421
I'm just not interested in being
some poster girl for women's rights.

11:58.134 --> 11:59.760
- What?
- Hmm?

11:59.844 --> 12:02.221
- What?
- What?

12:02.305 --> 12:04.807
You don't have anything
to say about this?

12:04.891 --> 12:07.643
I guess I don't.

12:07.727 --> 12:11.146
Honey, this is just
a career opportunity.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.732
You don't want me sleeping my way
to the top, do you?

12:13.817 --> 12:15.776
But the SEALS, babe?

12:15.860 --> 12:18.278
These guys are world-class warriors.
They see you coming–—

12:18.363 --> 12:20.406
- I mean–—
- I'm aware they may not want me there.

12:20.490 --> 12:22.074
- "May not"?
- Yes.

12:22.158 --> 12:25.744
They will eat corn flakes
out of your skull. Okay?

12:25.829 --> 12:29.206
To tell you the truth...

12:29.290 --> 12:31.417
I don't get it.

12:31.501 --> 12:33.752
I mean, you're doing
shit-hot at Intel'.

12:33.837 --> 12:37.005
Why do you wanna go off
and play soldier girl for?

12:43.596 --> 12:46.515
Royce, we're the same age.
We entered the Navy the same month.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.934
Which one of us
is wearing more ribbons?

12:49.018 --> 12:52.187
Oh, come on. This is just 'cause
I got lucky during the Gulf War.

12:52.272 --> 12:55.107
Yes, thank you'. Operational experience
is a key to advancement.

12:55.191 --> 12:59.111
Yet anyone with tits can't be on a sub,
can't be a SEAL, and don't even think–—

12:59.195 --> 13:01.113
Hey, whoa.
If you made up your mind to do it, go.

13:01.197 --> 13:05.200
You always do what you wanna do anyway.
Don't ask my permission.

13:05.285 --> 13:10.122
You wanna go off and live with a bunch of
cock-swinging commandos for three months–—

13:10.206 --> 13:12.124
Three months?

13:12.208 --> 13:16.170
What if I make this and go operational
for three years? What then?

13:16.254 --> 13:19.840
Oh, man, did I just miss
a decade or something?

13:19.924 --> 13:22.968
Will I wait if you go off to war?
Is that what you're asking me?

13:23.052 --> 13:27.181
Yeah, something like that.
Exactly like that.

13:27.265 --> 13:31.185
I didn't know I was gonna have to decide
the rest of my life tonight, Jordan.

13:31.269 --> 13:33.228
Maybe we should just
let this happen.

13:35.231 --> 13:37.149
Get your dick back in here.

13:37.233 --> 13:41.153
Don't ask me to tell you how I'm gonna
feel in three years. I don't know.

13:41.237 --> 13:43.155
I mean, neither do you.

13:43.239 --> 13:46.158
Right up until you said that,
I thought I did.

14:20.944 --> 14:23.278
Carry on.

14:23.363 --> 14:26.698
Put it down! Here we go!

14:50.807 --> 14:53.809
Lieutenant O'Neil
reporting for training, sir.

15:06.030 --> 15:08.907
Yes, of course.

15:08.992 --> 15:11.910
Please, Lieutenant,
have a seat.

15:11.995 --> 15:13.954
Thank you, sir.

15:18.751 --> 15:21.628
Would you care for a beverage?
Tea? Soda?

15:21.713 --> 15:25.299
- I'm fine, sir.
- You sure?

15:27.385 --> 15:30.762
Well, we're still coming to
terms with the exact protocol...

15:30.847 --> 15:33.765
for the integration
of our SEAL C.R.T. training.

15:33.850 --> 15:37.769
- Barber was my next stop, sir. I–—
- Don't worry about it.

15:37.854 --> 15:41.940
As long as it's off your collar, out of
your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.

15:42.025 --> 15:44.860
Sir, I'm not looking
for any special treatment.

15:44.944 --> 15:48.238
We're not trying to change
your sex, Lieutenant.

15:48.323 --> 15:51.450
You'll have a separate bed,
a separate head.

15:51.534 --> 15:54.661
If you have any special medical needs,
inform the infirmary.

15:54.746 --> 15:58.290
If your classmates or a superior
acts in a harassing...

15:58.374 --> 16:00.626
or otherwise unbecoming manner...

16:00.710 --> 16:03.211
you are to inform me
immediately...

16:03.296 --> 16:05.339
so that I can deal with it
immediately.

16:05.423 --> 16:08.634
It may not always run smooth...

16:08.718 --> 16:11.803
but we're trying to make it
as painless as possible.

16:11.888 --> 16:15.724
Thank you, sir, but I expect
a certain amount of pain.

16:15.808 --> 16:20.228
- Any questions?
- None at this time, sir.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.856
Then we're done, Lieutenant.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.900
Yes, sir.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.237
Permission to speak, sir?

16:31.074 --> 16:33.825
I'm not here to make
some kind of statement.

16:33.910 --> 16:37.496
I care about completing the training
and getting operational experience...

16:37.580 --> 16:39.581
just like everyone else,
I suspect.

16:39.666 --> 16:42.834
If you were like everyone else,
Lieutenant...

16:42.919 --> 16:46.171
I suspect we wouldn't be
making statements...

16:46.255 --> 16:48.215
about not making statements...

16:48.299 --> 16:51.009
would we?

16:51.094 --> 16:53.595
- Dismissed.
- Aye-aye, sir.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.298
Come on.

18:04.917 --> 18:08.128
Average woman, 25 percent body fat.
Twenty-five.

18:08.212 --> 18:11.590
That's a quarter fat, man.
I mean, think about that.

18:11.674 --> 18:13.550
If she pulls her own weight,
I got no problem with it.

18:13.634 --> 18:17.262
No split-tail's getting through
this program. No way, Jose.

18:28.816 --> 18:32.527
Oh, man, doesn't she know
it's rude to point?

18:32.612 --> 18:36.990
Whoo-hoo!

18:37.074 --> 18:40.410
Look, I don't know what she did
to get in here. I hate to speculate.

18:40.495 --> 18:43.789
I know I petitioned for two years
to get into this program.

18:43.873 --> 18:45.791
Two years of letter writing,
two years of pulling strings...

18:45.875 --> 18:47.709
and I finally get here,
and it's gone co-ed?

18:47.794 --> 18:52.672
Elite combat unit.
Whose genius idea was that?

18:52.757 --> 18:55.842
That's bullshit. I mean, they can't do
what we can. How's it happen?

18:55.927 --> 19:00.347
All I'm sayin' is one night, Lord. Give
me one night, and I'll set her straight.

19:00.431 --> 19:05.185
Slovnik's feeling good
like a hard man should.

19:05.269 --> 19:09.022
Stow it, gentlemen.
You heard the policy.

19:09.106 --> 19:10.732
Attention on deck!

19:33.798 --> 19:35.757
Stand easy.

19:38.886 --> 19:44.099
Welcome to SEAL C.R.T.
selection program.

19:44.183 --> 19:48.687
You have volunteered for
the most intensive military training...

19:48.771 --> 19:50.689
known to man.

19:50.773 --> 19:55.360
You are all proven operators
within the spec ops community.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.447
SEALS...

19:59.532 --> 20:01.616
E.O. D...

20:01.701 --> 20:05.579
Army Delta,
Marine Force Recon...

20:05.663 --> 20:07.747
Naval intel community...

20:07.832 --> 20:11.126
and so on.

20:11.210 --> 20:14.337
In spite of your expertise...

20:14.422 --> 20:19.426
many of you will not successfully
negotiate this program.

20:19.510 --> 20:24.389
Those that do will experience
an operational tempo...

20:24.473 --> 20:29.394
that far exceeds that of any unit
within the U.S. arsenal.

20:29.478 --> 20:31.855
That is all
that is to be said...

20:31.939 --> 20:36.401
about the special nature
of the C.R.T. training program.

20:36.485 --> 20:39.738
I now turn you over...

20:39.822 --> 20:43.742
to my Command Master Chief
John James Urgayle.

20:43.826 --> 20:46.578
Attention!

20:46.662 --> 20:50.123
Instructors, stand easy.

21:15.024 --> 21:18.944
I never saw a wild thing
sorry for itself

21:21.322 --> 21:25.617
A bird will fall frozen dead
from a bough...

21:25.701 --> 21:30.956
without ever having felt
sorry for itself.

21:45.346 --> 21:49.140
The ebb and flow
of the Atlantic tides...

21:49.225 --> 21:51.768
the drift of the continents...

21:51.852 --> 21:57.273
the very position of the sun
along its ecliptic.

21:57.358 --> 22:01.903
These are just a few of the things
I control in my world.

22:03.739 --> 22:09.661
- Is that clear?
- Yes, Command Master Chief!

22:09.745 --> 22:11.913
Instructor Pyro.

22:11.998 --> 22:14.165
Aye-aye, Master Chief.

22:14.250 --> 22:16.209
Instructors.

22:16.293 --> 22:21.006
Boat crews, stand by your boats.
Move your asses!

22:27.138 --> 22:29.723
Get 'em up high!
Move your asses!

22:29.807 --> 22:31.433
Get 'em up high!

22:31.517 --> 22:34.269
Forward, double time!
Hut!

22:41.610 --> 22:46.364
Hold them up, girls.
Come on. Don't you embarrass me.

22:46.449 --> 22:49.451
Get that up!

22:52.413 --> 22:56.291
What are you people, handicapped?
Get your feet up! Move it!

22:56.375 --> 22:59.461
This day hasn't even begun!
Move it around!

22:59.545 --> 23:01.588
Move the boat around!

23:01.672 --> 23:04.090
Prepare to down boat!

23:04.175 --> 23:07.469
Down boat, and don't you bruise
my sensitive fanny!

23:07.553 --> 23:09.888
I will run your butt
all the way to the beach!

23:09.972 --> 23:13.641
I have had better boat rides
by your mothers!

23:13.726 --> 23:15.977
Worm sperm,
every damn one of you!

23:16.062 --> 23:20.982
Instructor, get these spoon-chested
pencil-necks out of my face!

23:22.276 --> 23:24.819
All yours, Master Chief

23:26.739 --> 23:29.532
Take a good look
at your new home.

23:29.617 --> 23:31.576
Clarkson, get your boat crews!
Fall out by the fenders now!

23:31.660 --> 23:35.455
Move it, move it,
move it, move it!

23:48.761 --> 23:52.263
Sixty percent of you
will not pass this course!

23:52.348 --> 23:56.684
How do I know? Because that is
an historical fact!

23:56.769 --> 23:58.728
Now for the bad news!

23:58.813 --> 24:01.731
I always like to get
one quitter on the first day!

24:01.816 --> 24:04.484
And until I do,
that first day does not end!

24:04.568 --> 24:07.112
Look around! Look to your right!

24:07.196 --> 24:10.782
Look to your left.
I just wonder who it's gonna be.

24:10.866 --> 24:14.702
Who's got the hair
to stick it out?

24:14.787 --> 24:17.372
Come on! Be a part
of your crew's solution!

24:22.920 --> 24:25.630
- There's one goin' down!
- What are you doing on your knees?

24:25.714 --> 24:28.133
- Stamm, are you hurt?
- No!

24:28.217 --> 24:31.719
You wanna quit? Then get the fuck up,
Stamm! Get back on that fender!

24:31.804 --> 24:36.349
- Get up, guy! What the hell is going on?
- Flea. Flea, you all right?

24:36.433 --> 24:39.769
- What the fuck you doin' with him?
- Whoo-hoo!

24:39.854 --> 24:42.355
- What's your name, pancake?
- Flea! I mean, Montgomery, sir!

24:42.439 --> 24:46.442
Don't call me sir, moron. I work for a living.
How many names you got anyway?

24:46.527 --> 24:49.696
It, s F. Lee Montgomery, but that
just gets whittled down to Flea.

24:49.780 --> 24:53.158
- Are you my quitter, Mr. Flea?
- No, sir, Master Chief!

24:53.242 --> 24:55.660
Nothin' to be ashamed of, sir.
Do you wanna quit?

24:55.744 --> 24:58.037
Not me, Master Chief!
I'm full of joy!

24:58.122 --> 25:00.915
What the hell is going on
down there?

25:01.000 --> 25:03.126
Move that fender!

25:10.843 --> 25:13.887
Class!
Class, stand in line!

25:13.971 --> 25:17.765
Drop down, bent over push-ups!

25:17.850 --> 25:21.269
Quit playing with your hair,
O'Neil, and drop down!

25:21.353 --> 25:23.271
If you can't do these right,
O'Neil, do 'em on your knees!

25:23.355 --> 25:24.898
I like these just fine, sir.

25:24.982 --> 25:29.194
Down!

25:31.071 --> 25:33.323
Half a night, Lord.
Just give me half a night.

25:33.407 --> 25:36.910
- Cortez, stow the shit!
- I'm just having a sexual fantasy here!

25:36.994 --> 25:40.163
You have to be harder
than the average man...

25:40.247 --> 25:43.333
to even get in
this program!

25:43.417 --> 25:48.129
But I know some of you are already
thinking seriously about quitting!

25:48.214 --> 25:49.672
Get in this program, Stamm!

25:49.757 --> 25:52.217
Come on!
You don't need this abuse!

25:52.301 --> 25:56.888
Stamm, I think I have a quitter!
Do I have a quitter?

25:56.972 --> 25:59.474
Be ashamed for the rest
of your fucking lives!

26:03.103 --> 26:05.480
Go!

26:06.941 --> 26:09.734
Get out of that water!

26:09.818 --> 26:11.319
Roll! Right there!

26:11.403 --> 26:14.572
Roll!

26:18.661 --> 26:21.871
Pain is your friend,
your ally!

26:21.956 --> 26:26.376
It will tell you
when you are seriously injured!

26:26.460 --> 26:29.879
It will keep you awake
and angry...

26:29.964 --> 26:32.465
and remind you to finish
the job...

26:32.549 --> 26:34.509
and get the hell home!

26:36.178 --> 26:38.388
But you know the best thing
about pain?

26:38.472 --> 26:40.390
I don't know!

26:40.474 --> 26:42.850
It lets you know
you're not dead yet!

27:01.120 --> 27:03.788
I've seen Girl Scouts
move quicker than this!

27:03.872 --> 27:07.917
You people are pathetic!
Down boat!

27:08.002 --> 27:10.795
Mr. Wickwire,
you have four minutes...

27:10.879 --> 27:13.464
to secure swim gear
and down chow!

27:13.549 --> 27:16.467
Your entire class will
be severely penalized...

27:21.307 --> 27:24.767
Get your asses going!
Get moving!

27:24.852 --> 27:28.771
Goddamn it, what the fuck are you doing
sitting in my chair?

27:28.856 --> 27:32.608
Get the hell out of here!

27:32.693 --> 27:35.695
Scrape your plates!
Get the hell out of here!

27:35.779 --> 27:39.240
Get your ass up! Get your ass up!
Get it up, boy!

27:51.003 --> 27:53.421
Get the hell out of here!

27:53.505 --> 27:56.341
Scrape the plates
and get the hell out of here!

27:59.553 --> 28:01.471
I want you to stroll!
Drop down!

28:01.555 --> 28:06.225
Bear crawl, goddamn it! What the hell's
wrong with you, shithead?

28:06.310 --> 28:08.728
# I love the way you walk #

28:08.812 --> 28:11.814
# I'm treated by your walk #

28:11.899 --> 28:15.777
# I love the way you walk
to that beat #

28:15.861 --> 28:17.862
# I got my eyes on you ##

28:26.955 --> 28:29.582
All right, sewer trout,
everybody out!

28:29.666 --> 28:31.584
Move it out!

28:31.668 --> 28:34.629
Get in line
and get up here, people!

28:34.713 --> 28:36.714
Keep the whole line long!

28:36.799 --> 28:39.634
Move it, move it, move it!

28:39.718 --> 28:42.136
Get on line!
Get on line right here!

28:42.221 --> 28:45.890
- Get on line!
- All right, fall in! Dress it up!

28:45.974 --> 28:49.227
Get ready
for your med check!

28:49.311 --> 28:51.479
They're all yours,
Lieutenant.

28:52.648 --> 28:54.565
What's your name?

28:54.650 --> 28:57.527
- Newberry.
- What day of the week is it, Newberry?

28:57.611 --> 29:00.822
- It's fucking cold. That's what day of the week it is.
- Follow my finger.

29:02.866 --> 29:04.742
That's good.

29:04.827 --> 29:07.453
- What's your name?
- McCool.

29:07.538 --> 29:09.622
- Uh-huh. Where are you from?
- San Diego.

29:09.706 --> 29:11.707
San Diego.
Follow my finger.

29:15.587 --> 29:17.505
- What's your name?
- O'Neil.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.715
All right,
follow my finger, O'Neil.

29:19.800 --> 29:24.095
- Let me see your fingertips. Cold?
- Yeah.

29:24.179 --> 29:26.514
Way to gut it out,
Lieutenant.

29:26.598 --> 29:29.725
All right, corpsmen, they're
gonna live. Get the hell out of there.

29:29.810 --> 29:31.561
Class, fall out for chow.

29:31.645 --> 29:36.232
Move. I said move, goddamn it! What
do you want to do, take another swim?

29:36.316 --> 29:39.110
Maybe we don't want
chow tonight.

29:39.194 --> 29:42.113
Move your girlie butts!

29:46.493 --> 29:49.495
After you pack grits, report
to Alpha barracks on the double.

29:49.580 --> 29:54.167
Get them dick-skinning hands out of my
garbage cans. What the hell's goin' on?

29:54.251 --> 29:56.878
I told you, get your chow
and report to Alpha barracks!

29:56.962 --> 30:01.591
If you feel
you cannot carry on–—

30:01.675 --> 30:04.802
If you now care to admit
that you are woefully out of your depth...

30:04.887 --> 30:08.264
that bell is your salvation.

30:08.348 --> 30:10.641
Strike it three times,
and you're out.

30:10.726 --> 30:13.352
Free to get a hot shower
and a good night's sleep.

30:13.437 --> 30:15.938
I know you're saying
to yourself...

30:16.023 --> 30:18.483
"I'm an experienced operator.

30:18.567 --> 30:21.110
"I've put up with
19 straight hours of this.

30:21.195 --> 30:24.614
Do I really need
another 12 weeks?"

30:24.698 --> 30:29.118
If you don't know the answer to
that question, you do not belong here.

30:29.203 --> 30:31.996
- Back up, guys. Back up.
- That's all right...

30:32.080 --> 30:34.790
'cause this program
is not for everyone.

30:34.875 --> 30:38.836
Just step up to the bell,
save us all a lot of trouble.

30:38.921 --> 30:42.298
Go ahead.
Any takers?

30:42.382 --> 30:44.509
Goin' once.

30:46.345 --> 30:49.305
Goin' twice.

30:51.099 --> 30:54.602
All right,
welcome to a brand-new day.

30:54.686 --> 30:57.480
# I was lost #

30:57.564 --> 31:01.859
- Come on, now!
- # In a world of light #

31:01.944 --> 31:04.445
- # I always did #
- I did it, y'all!

31:04.530 --> 31:07.532
- # What was right #
- Hang on!

31:07.616 --> 31:09.784
# But now I sing #

31:09.868 --> 31:12.245
# A different song #

31:12.329 --> 31:16.082
# And I found joy #

31:16.166 --> 31:18.125
- # In doing it wrong #
- Sing it!

31:18.210 --> 31:20.628
# I found a friend #

31:20.712 --> 31:24.173
- Yeah!
- # In Satan #

31:24.258 --> 31:27.218
- # I found a friend #
- Uh-huh!

31:27.302 --> 31:30.346
- # In Satan #
- Stamm, don't do it, Stamm!

31:30.430 --> 31:33.599
- # I found a friend ##
- Come on, Stamm! Don't quit!

31:33.684 --> 31:36.561
Come on, Stamm!

31:43.110 --> 31:45.027
There goes Stamm.

31:45.112 --> 31:48.281
Dilettante.

31:48.365 --> 31:52.368
- Slow day at the office.
- Dropped on request.

31:52.452 --> 31:57.081
In no less than 500
neatly printed words...

31:57.165 --> 32:00.585
tell me why you love
the United States Navy.

32:02.254 --> 32:05.423
There will be no time limit
for this evolution.

32:08.343 --> 32:12.054
Put that pencil down. Get your fucking
feet together and sit up straight!

32:13.640 --> 32:16.767
You will write
when I tell you to write.

32:21.690 --> 32:26.068
When I come back,
I'll be countin' open eyes. Begin.

34:01.957 --> 34:06.627
Master Chief.
Rock and roll.

34:29.568 --> 34:31.944
Favorable weather conditions
for the next evolution.

34:32.027 --> 34:35.322
Are you ready, Lieutenant?

34:37.033 --> 34:40.244
Pencils down!
On your feet! Get up!

34:40.328 --> 34:43.289
Are you ready
for the next evolution?

34:43.373 --> 34:45.498
Hoo-yah, Instructor Pyro!

34:50.213 --> 35:01.098
Hoo-hah!

35:01.183 --> 35:03.726
Class, halt!

35:03.810 --> 35:06.270
Right face!

35:07.689 --> 35:10.441
Sling arms!

35:10.525 --> 35:13.569
- Fall out! Close it in!
- Evenin', cupcakes.

35:13.653 --> 35:17.782
Twelve minutes or less. That's all
you need to know about this course.

35:17.866 --> 35:19.909
Group one: Newberry...

35:19.993 --> 35:23.913
Hampton, McCool, Wickwire,
Slovnik and England.

35:23.997 --> 35:28.751
Group two: Miller, Flea, Powell,
Ayres, Cortez and O'Neil.

35:28.835 --> 35:32.797
You will find a white step
that is mandated female aid, O'Neil.

35:32.881 --> 35:35.007
You will find and use them
on every barrier obstacle.

35:35.091 --> 35:38.636
- Sergeant, I don't wanna use any step.
- Keep your mouth shut!

35:38.720 --> 35:42.890
- I wanna go through like the rest of the guys!
- Shut your fucking hole!

35:42.974 --> 35:48.145
Group three: Marshall, DeLuise,
Brown, Simons, Flynn and Stow.

35:48.230 --> 35:51.273
Group one, stand by!

35:51.358 --> 35:53.275
Bust 'em!

35:53.360 --> 35:54.985
Hoo-yah!

35:55.070 --> 35:57.780
Group two, stand by!

35:57.864 --> 36:00.407
Bust 'em!

36:01.952 --> 36:04.995
Group three, stand by!
Bust 'em!

36:05.080 --> 36:07.248
Move, move, move, move,
move, move!

36:41.074 --> 36:43.951
- Move it! Keep moving!
- Faster!

36:52.127 --> 36:54.920
O'Neil, let's go!
Let's move it on down!

36:55.005 --> 36:57.923
You want me
to get you a dress?

36:58.008 --> 37:00.676
- Keep it moving! Let's go!
- Do you squat when you pee?

37:00.760 --> 37:02.845
Come on!

37:04.973 --> 37:07.308
- Go, go, go! Go!
- This way!

37:07.392 --> 37:10.561
- Go, go, go!
- Keep it clear! Move it!

37:16.276 --> 37:19.653
Flea!

37:19.738 --> 37:22.489
Let's move! Let's run!

37:38.965 --> 37:41.342
Move, move, move!

37:43.178 --> 37:45.846
Into the tunnel!
Now!

37:54.356 --> 37:57.232
Get up! Come on!

38:11.790 --> 38:16.543
Cortez, get over here!
Drop down. Come on!

38:17.671 --> 38:19.797
Come on! Come on, Flea!

38:23.551 --> 38:26.553
Come on!

38:29.641 --> 38:31.392
- Come on!
- Go!

38:31.476 --> 38:34.979
- That's it!
- Help me up, Jordan.

38:39.025 --> 38:40.943
Come on.

38:47.283 --> 38:51.078
Grab my hand.
Give me your hand.

38:52.747 --> 38:55.666
Why don't you quit, O'Neil?

38:57.210 --> 38:58.836
Quit now.

39:01.381 --> 39:05.801
Let's go,
children. Come on. Let's go, Cortez.

39:05.885 --> 39:08.971
It pays to be a winner.
Come on, move your fat ass.

39:09.055 --> 39:12.099
Oh, this would be a fine time to quit,
wouldn't it, gentlemen?

39:12.183 --> 39:14.518
How many quitters we got?
Come on! Move it!

39:14.602 --> 39:18.981
Get on up here, mud muffins. Come on.
You guys look like sea slugs.

39:19.065 --> 39:21.984
O'Neil! What are you
waitin' for, girl?

39:22.068 --> 39:24.987
Get your fine fanny
down here!

39:25.071 --> 39:28.741
Come on, move it!
Move it, O'Neil!

39:28.825 --> 39:31.035
Oh, my God!

39:31.119 --> 39:35.205
O'Neil just tripped the trip wire!
Thank you very much!

39:35.290 --> 39:37.708
She is responsible for
killing the entire class.

39:37.792 --> 39:41.128
- Hoo-yah, O'Neil!
- Hoo-yah, O'Neil!

39:44.632 --> 39:48.218
Newberry: 13:08.

39:48.303 --> 39:51.430
Cortez: 13:10.

39:51.514 --> 39:55.476
Hampton: 13:15.
Blake: 13:22.

39:55.560 --> 39:58.228
Presley: 13:47.

39:58.313 --> 40:01.398
Pretty boy:
14 minutes flat.

40:01.483 --> 40:04.026
You are the blue-ribbon loser.

40:04.110 --> 40:06.028
These six have failed
the "O" course.

40:06.112 --> 40:09.907
- These six will run the course again.
- No, don't do it!

40:09.991 --> 40:13.285
Come on, man! Hang in there!

40:15.205 --> 40:17.122
Come on!

40:21.336 --> 40:23.545
Anybody else?

40:23.630 --> 40:25.089
All right.

40:25.173 --> 40:27.925
The rest of you wanna-bes have two hours
before the next evolution.

40:28.009 --> 40:30.928
I strongly suggest
you spend it in your racks...

40:31.012 --> 40:32.721
or sick bay.

40:32.806 --> 40:35.891
- Mr. Wickwire.
- Ten-hut!

40:35.975 --> 40:38.435
Muster back here at 0800...

40:38.520 --> 40:40.437
in your greens.

40:40.522 --> 40:42.439
Haul out!

40:42.524 --> 40:45.526
Class! As you were.

40:55.203 --> 40:58.247
Sergeant Cortez...

40:58.331 --> 41:02.793
however brief your stay
with this command might be...

41:02.877 --> 41:06.588
there are two words you will learn
to put together:

41:06.673 --> 41:10.425
Team... mate.

41:12.720 --> 41:14.638
Carry on.

41:14.722 --> 41:16.640
Wickwire, you heard him.
What are you waitin' for?

41:16.724 --> 41:18.142
Fall out. Move it!

41:20.270 --> 41:22.187
- Hoo-yah!
- Hoo-yah!

41:22.272 --> 41:25.190
What do we have here,
you hesitant bunch of harlots?

41:25.275 --> 41:27.192
You thinkin' about ringin' that bell?
Don't think! Move!

41:27.277 --> 41:31.029
Come on, somebody ring that bell
for me, please!

41:31.114 --> 41:35.159
Come on, honey bun, walk!
Get your bell-bangin' balls a-rollin'!

41:35.243 --> 41:37.661
You can be home
curled up in bed...

41:37.745 --> 41:40.164
in less than four hours!

41:40.248 --> 41:42.166
Ring that bell!

41:42.250 --> 41:46.170
That is music to my ears.
I'm gettin' emotional here.

41:46.254 --> 41:48.672
Anybody else?

41:48.756 --> 41:50.841
What's the matter,
O'Neil?

41:50.925 --> 41:54.887
Come on.

42:23.249 --> 42:26.168
I'd like to see
the Master Chief.

42:26.252 --> 42:30.505
Lieutenant O'Neil requests
to speak to the Master Chief.

42:30.590 --> 42:33.175
He's not home.

42:34.928 --> 42:36.845
Excuse me, Master Chief.

42:36.930 --> 42:40.057
Cortez finished ahead of me in group
two, but he failed and I didn't. Why?

42:40.141 --> 42:44.061
Instructor Pyro,
educate the lieutenant.

42:44.145 --> 42:47.064
You received an automatic
30-second deduction...

42:47.148 --> 42:49.066
which put you
under the wire.

42:49.150 --> 42:51.068
It's called gender-norming,
O'Neil.

42:51.152 --> 42:54.279
It's standard procedure
for all females in physical training.

42:54.364 --> 42:57.699
What "all females,"
if I'm the only one?

42:57.784 --> 42:59.701
I think I should have
the choice.

43:01.287 --> 43:03.538
Stand at attention.

43:03.623 --> 43:07.793
Lieutenant O'Neil, when I want
your opinion, I'll give it to ya.

43:24.352 --> 43:27.854
Did you take this matter up
with my Command Master Chief?

43:27.939 --> 43:30.774
I believe you instructed me to come
directly to you, sir...

43:30.858 --> 43:33.777
if I felt I was being
mistreated in any way.

43:33.861 --> 43:35.529
Oh.

43:39.742 --> 43:42.119
All right, Lieutenant.

43:42.203 --> 43:45.497
I want names.
I want specific grievances.

43:45.581 --> 43:48.000
Permission
to speak frankly, sir?

43:49.836 --> 43:51.753
It's you, sir.

43:51.838 --> 43:56.341
- It started the moment I came here.
- Oh? Really?

43:56.426 --> 43:58.552
It's the double standard.

43:59.804 --> 44:02.139
The separate quarters,
the deferential treatment.

44:02.223 --> 44:06.143
It's the way you practically pulled
my chair out for me when we first met.

44:06.227 --> 44:09.980
Because I was civil,
now you’re complainin'?

44:10.064 --> 44:11.982
I can't afford civility, sir.

44:12.066 --> 44:16.111
How am I supposed to fit in when
you've got me set up as an outsider?

44:16.195 --> 44:19.489
You've given me
a different set of rules.

44:19.574 --> 44:21.825
The answer is, I can't.

44:21.909 --> 44:25.329
Why don't you just issue me a
pink petticoat to wear around the base?

44:25.413 --> 44:27.956
Did you just have
a brain fart?

44:28.041 --> 44:30.834
Begging your pardon,
sir?

44:30.918 --> 44:34.046
Did you
just waltz in here...

44:34.130 --> 44:36.590
and bark at your
commanding officer?

44:38.134 --> 44:42.721
If so, I regard that
as a bona fide brain fart...

44:44.057 --> 44:47.684
and I resent it
when people fart inside my office.

44:47.769 --> 44:50.687
I think you’ve resented me
from the start, sir.

44:50.772 --> 44:53.357
What I resent,
Lieutenant...

44:53.441 --> 44:55.942
is some politician...

44:56.027 --> 44:58.945
using my base
as a test tube...

44:59.030 --> 45:02.366
for her grand
social experiment.

45:02.450 --> 45:04.368
What I resent...

45:04.452 --> 45:06.745
is the sensitivity
training...

45:06.829 --> 45:09.039
that is now mandatory
for my men...

45:09.123 --> 45:12.376
the OB-GYN
I have to keep on staff...

45:12.460 --> 45:16.171
just so someone can keep track
of your personal Pap smears.

45:16.255 --> 45:18.882
But most of all,
what I resent...

45:18.966 --> 45:20.884
is your perfume...

45:20.968 --> 45:24.096
however subtle it may be...

45:24.180 --> 45:28.725
competin' with the aroma
of my fine $3.59 cigar...

45:28.810 --> 45:30.936
which I will put out
this instant...

45:31.020 --> 45:33.939
if the phallic nature of it
happens to offend...

45:34.023 --> 45:36.900
your goddamned
fragile sensibilities!

45:36.984 --> 45:39.361
- Does it?
- No, sir.

45:39.445 --> 45:41.488
"No, sir," what?

45:43.324 --> 45:45.325
The shape
doesn't bother me, sir.

45:45.410 --> 45:47.536
Just the goddamned
sweet stench.

45:59.507 --> 46:01.425
One standard.

46:01.509 --> 46:04.094
Just treat me the same.
No better, no worse.

46:05.513 --> 46:08.432
You're gonna get
everything you want, O'Neil.

46:08.516 --> 46:11.435
Let’s just see if you want
what you're gonna get.

46:11.519 --> 46:14.104
Hoo-yah, sir.

46:20.194 --> 46:23.113
Hey–—

46:23.197 --> 46:25.157
Hello?

46:27.910 --> 46:29.786
Anybody here?

46:29.871 --> 46:34.291
#Just didn't wanna
tell you #

46:34.375 --> 46:37.210
# Oh, see, this way I'm #

46:37.295 --> 46:41.256
# Havin' fun
with my new song #

46:41.340 --> 46:46.261
# Wild circumstance #

46:46.345 --> 46:48.763
# Who would've guessed #

46:50.057 --> 46:51.850
# Forced my hand #

46:51.934 --> 46:55.395
# When I was homeless #

46:55.480 --> 47:01.026
#Just didn't understand #

47:01.110 --> 47:03.653
# If you saw me #

47:03.738 --> 47:08.450
# Holding his hand #

47:08.534 --> 47:12.871
# I fell #

47:14.081 --> 47:16.166
# From your grace #

47:16.250 --> 47:18.418
# Isn't that insane #

47:18.503 --> 47:20.253
# I'm jealous #

47:20.338 --> 47:26.218
# I didn't wanna tell you #

47:26.302 --> 47:27.636
# To your face #

47:27.720 --> 47:30.138
# But I left claims #

47:30.223 --> 47:34.476
# That you couldn't refuse #

47:34.560 --> 47:36.645
# Obvious #

47:36.729 --> 47:39.981
# Your friends will see #

47:40.066 --> 47:44.736
# I knew you’d get the word
eventually #

47:46.113 --> 47:48.198
# I'd rather have them #

47:48.282 --> 47:51.660
# Tell you #

47:51.744 --> 47:54.704
# It’s just as well #

47:54.789 --> 47:56.748
# The bitch is gone ##

48:49.844 --> 48:52.804
Grab your sacks!
Get in line now! Move!

48:52.888 --> 48:54.889
Who do you think you are,
coming in here?

48:54.974 --> 48:55.974
Guess I'm your roommate.

48:56.058 --> 48:58.977
N–— N–— No. You can't stay here.

48:59.061 --> 49:02.063
- You can't sleep here right next to me.
- The C.O. says I can.

49:02.148 --> 49:04.065
No–— Come here.
Come here!

49:04.150 --> 49:06.067
Cortez, come here,
goddang it!

49:06.152 --> 49:09.988
Look it. Girlfriend bring all her stuff
in here like she think she gonna–—

49:10.072 --> 49:11.823
- Hey!
- Shit! This is Tampax!

49:11.907 --> 49:13.950
- Stand at attention!
- This is not gonna happen.

49:14.035 --> 49:16.536
Stand at attention!

49:22.335 --> 49:24.753
Mr. Wickwire,
in your leisure time...

49:24.837 --> 49:28.131
make out a schedule that rotates
head and shower usage.

49:28.215 --> 49:30.675
Yes, Master Chief

49:36.223 --> 49:39.434
Anything else we can do
for your celebrity career, Lieutenant?

49:39.518 --> 49:42.812
- That'll be all–—
- You now have exactly one minute to muster!

49:42.897 --> 49:46.316
If even one of you
Van Winkle wanna-bes are late...

49:46.400 --> 49:48.943
I will personally see
none of you sleep for a week!

49:49.028 --> 49:52.697
Let me get this straight:
We're sharing the same fucking head?

49:52.782 --> 49:55.200
Listen, you moron,
I am here to stay.

49:55.284 --> 50:00.163
If you don't wanna be in my life, move out
or ring out. That's it. End of file.

50:00.247 --> 50:02.123
You got one minute
to put your fuckin' clothes on.

50:02.208 --> 50:04.000
- What about the tampons?
- Hey, hey, hey.

50:04.085 --> 50:07.504
- Don't you care about tampons?
- Get over yourself, Slovnik.

50:07.588 --> 50:10.465
- Put your clothes on. Let's go!
- Nice.

50:10.549 --> 50:12.550
- Here we go.
- Here we go!

50:17.932 --> 50:21.184
Pick 'em up!
Put 'em down!

50:25.314 --> 50:27.273
I'll have another one.

50:28.984 --> 50:30.944
Thanks a lot.

50:33.114 --> 50:35.865
Oh, congratulations,
Mr. Secretary.

50:35.950 --> 50:38.702
Say hello to the President
for me, will you?

50:38.786 --> 50:41.246
So, what was the deal you made
with the devil? I mean, DeHaven.

50:41.330 --> 50:43.248
- Oooh.
- Didn't you hear?

50:43.332 --> 50:46.251
Effective immediately,
all vessels in the Navy...

50:46.335 --> 50:48.378
can no longer
be referred to as "she. "

50:48.462 --> 50:51.423
We're to call it "it. "

50:54.135 --> 50:57.053
- Royce, we need a fourth.
- Yes, sir.

50:57.138 --> 50:59.806
- You're it.
- Thank you, sir.

51:03.644 --> 51:05.562
- Hello!
- Congratulations on the new job.

51:05.646 --> 51:08.106
- You'll make a fine–—
- Mr. Secretary, sir.

51:11.026 --> 51:12.569
Oh, man.

51:12.653 --> 51:15.572
Not playing down to the abilities
of your superior officer, are you?

51:15.656 --> 51:17.741
No, sir. Snooker’s just
not my game.

51:17.825 --> 51:19.743
Too many balls
on the table.

51:19.827 --> 51:24.038
Distracting, isn't it? That one
pink ball right in the middle.

51:28.878 --> 51:31.087
- Who's got a cigar?
- Didn't know you smoked, sir.

51:31.172 --> 51:35.091
I don't. I just want to chew
the hell out of it.

51:35.176 --> 51:38.595
Uh, "The woman, identity unknown,
is believed to be...

51:38.679 --> 51:43.308
"the first female candidate for
the elite Navy SEALS training program.

51:43.392 --> 51:46.311
Her presence could signal a shift
in the military's–—"

51:46.395 --> 51:49.230
These were supposed to have been
discreet test cases.

51:49.315 --> 51:51.232
That was
the agreement.

51:51.317 --> 51:54.944
Suppose this lady's getting friendly
with the press?

51:55.029 --> 51:59.991
It's DeHaven. Had to be. She is gonna
milk this cow on all four tits.

52:00.075 --> 52:04.162
In the last two hours my office
has received 14 requests for interviews.

52:04.246 --> 52:06.581
No interviews.
That's the last thing we need.

52:06.665 --> 52:09.542
Where is she in the training,
this woman?

52:11.921 --> 52:15.173
We'll have that information
for you before the night's out.

52:15.257 --> 52:20.136
It's my understanding that she just
finished the P.T. phase of her training.

52:20.221 --> 52:22.138
She made it
through hell week.

52:22.223 --> 52:24.307
Won't last one week,
huh?

52:24.391 --> 52:28.436
So, have you been monitoring
this situation for us, Commander?

52:28.521 --> 52:32.315
No, sir. I just made
some unofficial inquiries.

52:32.399 --> 52:34.818
Well, make it official.

52:34.902 --> 52:39.030
I want a brief back in my office
once a week.

52:39.114 --> 52:43.159
G.I. Jane. Why don't they just get it
over with and call her Joan of Arc?

52:47.122 --> 52:49.082
Your shot, Gary.

53:03.430 --> 53:06.057
Pardon me, sir. Phone call
from Senator DeHaven.

53:07.101 --> 53:09.018
Captain Salem here.

53:09.103 --> 53:12.021
Are you in the habit of lettin'
photographers traipse around your base...

53:12.106 --> 53:14.023
snapping their fill?

53:14.108 --> 53:17.151
These are supposed to be
discreet test cases.

53:17.236 --> 53:21.072
Senator, they stand out on a
public highway using telephoto lenses.

53:21.156 --> 53:24.075
There is nothin'
I can do about it...

53:24.159 --> 53:26.828
unless you want me to infringe
on their civil liberties...

53:26.912 --> 53:32.166
which I'll be glad to do if you’ll just
trim a little fat off the Constitution.

53:32.251 --> 53:35.879
Did you just mouth off to a senior
member of the Senate Arms Committee?

53:35.963 --> 53:39.257
I'll give you points for style,
just nothin' for smarts.

53:39.341 --> 53:42.760
- I was just explaining–—
- From this point forward, I want all press matters...

53:42.845 --> 53:44.762
coordinated via my office.

53:44.847 --> 53:46.556
Let me handle the R.P.M.

53:46.640 --> 53:50.226
I'll be goddamned if I'm gonna watch
Hayes pull flowers out of his ass...

53:50.311 --> 53:52.228
and take credit
for this one.

53:52.313 --> 53:56.190
I'll be sure to pass your request along
to my chain of command.

53:56.275 --> 53:58.192
Good.

53:58.277 --> 54:00.653
Now, how's my girl
doin', anyway?

54:02.990 --> 54:05.909
You need to know
what it feels like to drown...

54:05.993 --> 54:09.120
in order
to avoid panic...

54:09.204 --> 54:12.874
and perhaps gain those few seconds
that just might save your life.

54:12.958 --> 54:17.086
The natural tendency
toward premature panic...

54:17.171 --> 54:20.423
is what makes this such an effective
interrogation technique.

54:22.217 --> 54:28.222
# Mama told me
not to come #

54:30.851 --> 54:33.436
# That ain't the way
to have fun, no #

54:33.520 --> 54:35.271
# Uh-uh #

54:35.356 --> 54:37.148
Carb 15.
Military designator: M4.

54:37.232 --> 54:40.610
Nothing more than a chopped-down
version of the M16 assault rifle.

54:40.694 --> 54:42.904
By taking the proper
precautions...

54:42.988 --> 54:45.782
this weapon can be considered
water-resistant.

54:45.866 --> 54:49.494
Many techniques have been developed
to seal the muzzle of the weapon.

54:49.578 --> 54:51.829
Nothing, however, surpasses
the technique developed in my time.

54:51.914 --> 54:53.873
- Crazy. Wild. Wild.
- Shut up, Slovnik.

54:53.958 --> 54:56.626
# Mama told me not to come #

54:57.795 --> 54:59.963
# Mama told me
not to come #

55:01.757 --> 55:05.468
# She said, That ain't the way
to have fun, no #

55:05.552 --> 55:09.263
Boat six: Wickwire, McCool, Flea,
Cortez, Slovnik and O'Neil.

55:09.348 --> 55:11.641
Oh, come on.

55:11.725 --> 55:14.936
Somebody got a problem
with my organizational skills?

55:15.020 --> 55:17.021
Fine by me,
Master Chief.

55:17.106 --> 55:19.107
No problem here,
Master Chief

55:19.191 --> 55:20.942
# That ain't the way
to have fun, no #

55:22.861 --> 55:24.988
# That ain't the way
to have fun ##

55:25.072 --> 55:27.156
Stand by. Prepare to hit the surf.
Move!

55:27.241 --> 55:29.867
Boat four,
answer me this:

55:29.952 --> 55:35.373
When I see the sea once more,
will the sea have seen or not seen me?

55:35.457 --> 55:38.167
This will be
a graded exercise.

55:38.252 --> 55:40.169
On my mark.
Stand by.

55:40.254 --> 55:41.963
Mark!

55:57.396 --> 55:59.564
- Cortez, done.
- Time!

55:59.648 --> 56:01.607
Weapons on the table.

56:03.485 --> 56:05.486
Is it hot out here,
or is it just me?

56:08.157 --> 56:10.033
- Kind of tender?
- It's okay.

56:10.117 --> 56:12.410
Mmm. This?

56:12.494 --> 56:15.413
- A little bit.
- Okay, you can get dressed.

56:15.497 --> 56:18.916
Try to get as much air on those
abrasions on your back as you can.

56:19.001 --> 56:21.044
It's called amenorrhea
when you lose your period.

56:21.128 --> 56:25.048
It's because you drop body fat, but
not at all unusual for female athletes.

56:25.132 --> 56:28.176
Okay, you got tendinitis
in your right knee...

56:28.260 --> 56:32.180
and, uh, that is standard issue
jungle rot on your left foot.

56:32.264 --> 56:34.724
- Lovely.
- So, you're quite a mess.

56:34.808 --> 56:37.351
Let's fix me up
and get me back out there.

56:49.323 --> 56:51.908
- Hey, Jordan!
- Whoa! Ladies!

56:51.992 --> 56:55.411
If I follow you home,
would you have premarital sex with me?

56:55.496 --> 56:58.915
Slovnik! You're barkin' up
the wrong dress. They ain't your type.

57:05.714 --> 57:07.423
Shit fire
and save matches.

57:12.721 --> 57:16.432
Goddamn three-ring circus
around here. Shit.

57:21.855 --> 57:24.065
You trying to be bad?

57:24.149 --> 57:27.235
You could be home curled up,
playin' with electrical toys!

57:27.319 --> 57:31.072
Go on!

57:33.325 --> 57:36.327
Lieutenant,
why are you doing this?

57:36.411 --> 57:39.789
- Do you ask the men the same question?
- As a matter of fact, I do.

57:39.873 --> 57:43.292
- And what do they say?
- 'Cause I get to blow shit up.

57:45.504 --> 57:47.421
Well, there you go.

57:49.925 --> 57:52.760
On my mark. Stand by!

57:52.845 --> 57:54.804
Mark!

58:02.187 --> 58:05.648
- O'Neil, done.
- Cortez, done.

58:05.732 --> 58:07.817
Does it work, Lieutenant?

58:07.901 --> 58:09.944
Well done, Lieutenant.

58:18.245 --> 58:21.164
The Navy is still
declining to release the woman's name...

58:21.248 --> 58:24.542
but Senator DeHaven's office
is confirming that G.I. Jane...

58:24.626 --> 58:28.796
has outlasted many of her male
counterparts in the elite Navy program...

58:28.881 --> 58:31.883
said to be one of
the most grueling anywhere.

58:31.967 --> 58:36.429
Joining us now on Washington Tonight,
for the feminist perspective–—

58:54.323 --> 58:57.200
Coxswain, hard a-port!

58:57.284 --> 59:00.703
- Line it up! Move it over!
- Come about!

59:02.080 --> 59:03.873
Straighten 'er out!

59:03.957 --> 59:08.085
- Line 'er up!
- Stay on your line! Get ready!

59:08.170 --> 59:11.047
- Whoo!
- Come on! Move aft!

59:11.131 --> 59:14.675
Get up there!
Let's go, go, go!

59:14.760 --> 59:19.722
Hoo-fucking-yah! It's like having sex
in a car crash! Whoo-hoo!

59:19.806 --> 59:22.141
Okay, McCool, get up there.
Hoo-yah, baby!

59:23.936 --> 59:26.812
Come on, O'Neil.
Get on up here.

59:26.897 --> 59:29.106
Let's go.
Use your arms! God!

59:29.191 --> 59:30.858
- Come on, O'Neil!
- Cut her loose!

59:30.943 --> 59:32.485
Let her go!

59:35.822 --> 59:39.033
Well, hoo-yah. About time
we dropped some dead weight.

59:41.662 --> 59:44.080
We don't leave
our people behind!

59:44.164 --> 59:48.376
What the hell you waitin' for?
Get with your crew! Get in there!

59:48.460 --> 59:51.045
Let's go!
Let's go!

59:51.129 --> 59:53.714
Come on, go!
You're swimmin' home!

59:56.343 --> 59:59.595
- Wanna pick 'em back up?
- Let's go home.

01:00:07.354 --> 01:00:09.772
Well, this is bullshit.

01:00:09.856 --> 01:00:12.984
Now they're hammering me
just because she's in my boat crew.

01:00:13.068 --> 01:00:16.153
If you’d kept your mouth shut, we
wouldn't be out here in the first place.

01:00:17.656 --> 01:00:20.283
Had a grandfather
wanted to be a Navy man.

01:00:20.367 --> 01:00:24.912
He wanted to fire them big guns
off them big-ass battleships.

01:00:24.997 --> 01:00:29.333
Navy says to him, "No. You can only do
one thing on a battleship, son.

01:00:29.418 --> 01:00:31.294
That's cook. "

01:00:31.378 --> 01:00:34.297
I'm not talkin' about
100 years ago, either.

01:00:34.381 --> 01:00:37.800
I'm talkin' the United States Navy,
middle of World War Two.

01:00:37.884 --> 01:00:40.219
You know the reason
they gave him?

01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:45.891
The reason why they told my grandfather
he couldn't fight for his country?

01:00:48.061 --> 01:00:50.479
'Cause Negroes
can't see at night.

01:00:50.564 --> 01:00:52.523
Bad night vision.

01:00:53.734 --> 01:00:56.319
Damn, McCool.
That's unbelievable.

01:00:56.403 --> 01:00:58.529
Thank God
times have changed.

01:00:58.613 --> 01:01:00.573
Have they?

01:01:01.742 --> 01:01:03.659
So, you see, O'Neil...

01:01:03.744 --> 01:01:05.661
I know where
you're coming from.

01:01:05.746 --> 01:01:08.664
To them you’re just the new nigger
on the block, that's all.

01:01:08.749 --> 01:01:11.709
- You just moved in a little too early.
- Thanks, man.

01:01:27.768 --> 01:01:29.852
The Israelis
tried it.

01:01:29.936 --> 01:01:31.854
Women in combat.

01:01:31.938 --> 01:01:36.192
Seems the men couldn't get used
to the sight of women blown open.

01:01:36.276 --> 01:01:39.362
They'd linger over
the wounded females...

01:01:39.446 --> 01:01:42.740
often trying to save those
who obviously couldn't be saved...

01:01:42.824 --> 01:01:45.743
often to the detriment
of the mission.

01:01:45.827 --> 01:01:48.746
You were given
the Navy Cross, right?

01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:51.332
Can I ask
what you got it for?

01:01:52.417 --> 01:01:55.878
Since it bears
on this conversation...

01:01:55.962 --> 01:01:59.215
I got it for pulling a 240-pound man
out of a burning tank.

01:01:59.299 --> 01:02:02.218
So when a man tries to rescue
another man, he's a hero...

01:02:02.302 --> 01:02:06.680
but when he tries to rescue a woman,
he’s just gone soft.

01:02:07.808 --> 01:02:10.142
Could you have
pulled that man clear?

01:02:11.812 --> 01:02:16.065
You couldn't even haul your own
body weight out of the water today.

01:02:16.149 --> 01:02:18.150
Permission to get dressed,
Master Chief.

01:02:23.031 --> 01:02:25.950
Mr. England went out
with a stress fracture.

01:02:26.034 --> 01:02:28.953
I'm moving Mr. Wickwire to boat five.
That puts you in charge of six.

01:02:29.037 --> 01:02:30.955
Why not McCool?
He's the same rank?

01:02:31.039 --> 01:02:34.917
Because you were commissioned a month
earlier. Makes you senior officer.

01:02:36.503 --> 01:02:39.755
Remember,
there are no bad crews...

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:41.799
only bad leaders.

01:02:47.806 --> 01:02:49.890
In the more academically
oriented evolution...

01:02:49.975 --> 01:02:52.560
she's receiving
better marks than most.

01:02:52.644 --> 01:02:55.563
Plus, she's outlasted
40 percent of her peers.

01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:58.607
- With dual standards.
- Actually, no, sir.

01:02:58.692 --> 01:03:02.653
She's been going head-to-head
with the men for some time now.

01:03:02.737 --> 01:03:06.407
So she's lasted eight weeks.
That's wonderful.

01:03:06.491 --> 01:03:08.409
Joan of Arc
meets Supergirl.

01:03:08.493 --> 01:03:10.995
With S.E.R.E. training
coming up next week, sir.

01:03:11.079 --> 01:03:14.248
Commander, we'd like to see
more detail in your reports.

01:03:14.332 --> 01:03:16.250
Let's include
more background information.

01:03:16.334 --> 01:03:20.629
Past training reps; medical history;
any grievances she previously filed.

01:03:20.714 --> 01:03:22.381
Understood?

01:03:23.425 --> 01:03:26.802
Um, actually,
not completely, sir.

01:03:26.887 --> 01:03:31.015
Am–— Am I being asked to provide
ammunition against this woman...

01:03:31.099 --> 01:03:34.351
in case the outcome isn't
what the Navy expects, sir?

01:03:34.436 --> 01:03:37.271
Absolutely not. We're simply
documenting as thoroughly as possible...

01:03:37.355 --> 01:03:39.940
in the event this turns
into a legal matter.

01:03:40.025 --> 01:03:42.610
Don't read anything
Machiavellian into it, Commander.

01:03:42.694 --> 01:03:44.945
I'll try not to, sir.

01:03:45.030 --> 01:03:46.947
Take your leave,
Commander.

01:03:47.032 --> 01:03:48.949
Thank you.

01:03:51.369 --> 01:03:55.164
Loganville. Wilmington.
Coronado. Bedsford.

01:03:55.248 --> 01:03:57.166
This is deeper
than we thought.

01:03:57.250 --> 01:03:59.502
Look at Texas.

01:03:59.586 --> 01:04:01.837
I count four–—
no, five bases.

01:04:01.922 --> 01:04:04.840
We may not have to suffer
DeHaven much longer.

01:04:04.925 --> 01:04:08.344
She stands to lose 6,000 military,
4,000 civilian jobs...

01:04:08.428 --> 01:04:11.013
maybe 350 million
in lost revenue per annum.

01:04:11.097 --> 01:04:13.015
Re-election's
six months off.

01:04:13.099 --> 01:04:15.351
The D.O.D.'s put her
out of business.

01:04:21.233 --> 01:04:23.150
Yeah.

01:04:23.235 --> 01:04:27.696
People in Washington are scope-locked
on what's happening down there.

01:04:27.781 --> 01:04:31.033
- Know how they're talking about you?
- I saw a newspaper.

01:04:31.117 --> 01:04:34.203
That's the public side.
Privately, it's all being documented.

01:04:34.287 --> 01:04:37.540
I mean everything, right down
to your breakfast and bra size.

01:04:37.624 --> 01:04:39.583
Why are you
telling me this?

01:04:40.752 --> 01:04:44.171
Big symbols
make big targets, Jordan.

01:04:45.632 --> 01:04:48.551
There's a lot of people
who don't want to see you finish.

01:04:48.635 --> 01:04:50.553
How about you, Royce?

01:04:50.637 --> 01:04:52.680
Do you want
to see me finish?

01:04:52.764 --> 01:04:55.683
Look, I'm just trying
to warn you. All right?

01:04:55.767 --> 01:04:58.561
Get you thinkin' about
where this might be headed in case–—

01:04:58.645 --> 01:05:01.230
Well, le t me just warn you.

01:05:01.314 --> 01:05:03.732
I'm gonna go through with this...

01:05:03.817 --> 01:05:07.611
and the more everybody fucks with me,
the more I wanna gut it out.

01:05:07.696 --> 01:05:10.614
So don't you expect me back
anytime soon.

01:05:10.699 --> 01:05:13.617
Look, that is not
what I want, Jordan.

01:05:13.702 --> 01:05:15.619
I mean–—
Goddamn it.

01:05:15.704 --> 01:05:18.622
It is, but it isn't.
Do you understand?

01:05:18.707 --> 01:05:21.041
Still having a hard time
making decisions?

01:05:23.253 --> 01:05:27.131
Jordan, just
watch your six, okay?

01:05:30.010 --> 01:05:31.802
I gotta go, Royce.

01:05:31.886 --> 01:05:33.804
Wait a se cond.
Don't–—

01:05:49.904 --> 01:05:53.449
Survival, e evasion,
resistance and escape.

01:05:53.533 --> 01:05:55.451
This is it, tadpoles.

01:05:55.535 --> 01:05:59.038
Your target t is inside
an area of five square miles.

01:05:59.122 --> 01:06:01.540
When and if
you locate this facility...

01:06:01.625 --> 01:06:04.710
you gather up as much intel as possible
within the allotted time frame...

01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:06.712
and get the hell outta there.

01:06:06.796 --> 01:06:10.966
You will be penalized for early
extraction, but even more for capture.

01:06:11.051 --> 01:06:12.968
Trust me.
Welcome to S.E.R.E.

01:06:15.889 --> 01:06:19.767
- Get ready! Stand up!
- Stand up! Aye!

01:06:19.851 --> 01:06:22.478
- Thirty seconds!
- Thirty seconds! Aye!

01:06:22.562 --> 01:06:25.773
First man up, go!

01:06:28.109 --> 01:06:33.489
Go!

01:07:28.128 --> 01:07:30.087
So, where'd they drop us, L.T.?

01:07:30.171 --> 01:07:34.049
At the line of march, 2-1-0.

01:07:34.134 --> 01:07:38.053
And just for shits and giggles,
let's switch to five for tactical traffic.

01:07:38.138 --> 01:07:40.764
Maintain casual dialogue
on assigned channels.

01:07:40.849 --> 01:07:45.310
Slovnik, take us to 2-1-0.
Cortez, move out.

01:07:46.688 --> 01:07:48.522
Move out.

01:07:49.774 --> 01:07:51.692
Let's go.

01:08:07.709 --> 01:08:10.252
Four clicks, 2-2-6.

01:08:14.215 --> 01:08:16.925
She doesn't have one fuckin' clue
where we're goin'.

01:08:17.010 --> 01:08:19.386
Shut up.

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:28.895
Cortez, Slov, you take my left flank.

01:08:28.979 --> 01:08:30.898
The rest of us, move back.

01:09:11.064 --> 01:09:13.982
Looks like
she's right on the money.

01:09:14.067 --> 01:09:17.653
I had a busted watch once,
and it was right twice a day.

01:09:30.082 --> 01:09:32.000
Cortez.

01:09:32.085 --> 01:09:34.461
Target ahead. Belay my last.

01:09:34.546 --> 01:09:36.921
New rally point, my location.

01:09:49.769 --> 01:09:52.520
McCool, Newberry, right side.

01:09:52.604 --> 01:09:55.774
Flea, you come with me.
Let's move out.

01:10:05.326 --> 01:10:08.537
Listen up, everybody.
We need film from all angles.

01:10:08.621 --> 01:10:11.748
Record weapons, vehicles.
Count bad guys, Get ranks, if visible.

01:10:11.833 --> 01:10:15.335
Slov, Cortez, check antenna
for comms capability.

01:10:17.505 --> 01:10:20.173
- McCool?
- There's nothing there, O'Neil.

01:10:20.258 --> 01:10:22.593
There are no prisoners,
there are no guards.

01:10:22.677 --> 01:10:26.346
Maybe we found this place
a little too easy. There's nobody there.

01:10:26.431 --> 01:10:28.223
Cortez.

01:10:28.308 --> 01:10:31.351
- McCool. Ten o'clock.
- Cortez!

01:10:32.604 --> 01:10:35.022
What the hell
are you doing?

01:10:35.106 --> 01:10:38.108
This is Team Leader to Team Fuck-up.
Knock the grab-ass off.

01:10:38.192 --> 01:10:41.904
Get back to your positions.
You're compromising the unit.

01:10:41.988 --> 01:10:45.365
- That's an order. Do it now.
- What are these fuckin' clowns doing?

01:10:49.537 --> 01:10:51.705
No, Slov.

01:10:51.789 --> 01:10:54.416
It’s just a souvenir.

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.209
No, Slov, not–—

01:10:56.294 --> 01:10:58.295
What the hell–—

01:10:58.379 --> 01:11:01.590
Shouting]
- Let's go!

01:11:01.674 --> 01:11:05.928
Welcome to summer camp, boys and girls!

01:11:06.012 --> 01:11:08.805
Blessed is he who expected nothing...

01:11:08.890 --> 01:11:12.100
for he shall not be disappointed!

01:11:12.185 --> 01:11:14.102
Rendezvous rally point.

01:11:14.187 --> 01:11:17.648
Come on!

01:11:17.732 --> 01:11:19.816
Let's go!

01:11:26.032 --> 01:11:28.825
- It snapped.
- Oh, shit.

01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:33.455
Move your hand, man. All right, don't
move. You're only gonna make it worse.

01:11:33.539 --> 01:11:36.792
- Oh, Jesus.
- Aaaah!

01:11:41.714 --> 01:11:44.675
Get up. Get up!

01:11:47.345 --> 01:11:50.889
Get off me!
I can't fucking breathe!

01:11:53.601 --> 01:11:56.228
Get him up.

01:11:57.897 --> 01:12:00.315
Aaaah!

01:12:04.278 --> 01:12:06.196
Flea.
Are you all right?

01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:08.865
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
I'm all right. I'm all right.

01:12:12.704 --> 01:12:14.287
Get down!

01:12:14.372 --> 01:12:17.624
Who's in charge here?
Got any officers here?

01:12:17.709 --> 01:12:20.335
Got somethin' to say down here?

01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:22.671
- You an officer. Huh?
- Fuck you. Fuck you.

01:12:22.755 --> 01:12:26.425
You're too fuckin' ugly
to be an fuckin' officer.

01:12:28.136 --> 01:12:31.680
Who's the officer in charge? Huh?

01:12:31.764 --> 01:12:33.849
You in charge here?

01:12:33.933 --> 01:12:37.185
I am! I am!

01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:39.187
Boy, that was stupid.

01:12:42.608 --> 01:12:45.068
Oh, fuck. Oh, God.

01:12:45.153 --> 01:12:48.405
So you're in charge, huh?

01:12:48.489 --> 01:12:52.826
Get him in the cage!

01:12:54.746 --> 01:12:57.497
Any other officers here?

01:12:57.582 --> 01:12:59.875
Get him in the cage. Move it!

01:13:05.965 --> 01:13:07.883
Third box.

01:13:15.141 --> 01:13:17.059
Wake up, sunshine.

01:13:17.143 --> 01:13:19.519
Shut up!

01:13:19.604 --> 01:13:22.022
Get up!

01:13:22.106 --> 01:13:25.567
- Don't let 'em break you, Flea.
- Take it easy, man!

01:13:31.574 --> 01:13:33.492
You know...

01:13:34.577 --> 01:13:37.245
I had an apartment
this size once.

01:13:40.708 --> 01:13:43.585
We're gonna be all right.
Right, Wick?

01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:46.088
We're gonna make it,
right?

01:13:46.172 --> 01:13:48.715
I don't know.
Last time I didn't.

01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:50.675
What happened?

01:13:51.719 --> 01:13:54.096
I had a problem
with small spaces.

01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:58.266
But as you can see, I've–—
I've worked that out.

01:13:58.351 --> 01:14:01.228
Are you hurt, or are you injured?

01:14:01.312 --> 01:14:03.605
Aaah!

01:14:05.691 --> 01:14:08.860
Don't let 'em use me against you,
no matter what. Okay?

01:14:10.321 --> 01:14:12.239
Okay.

01:14:12.323 --> 01:14:14.950
What the fuck is your problem?

01:14:16.702 --> 01:14:18.954
Owww!
Aaaah!

01:14:19.038 --> 01:14:20.747
What's your problem?

01:14:20.832 --> 01:14:23.458
Are you hurt, Flea, or just injured?

01:14:23.543 --> 01:14:27.629
If you're injured, we'll get you off the
island and get you medical attention.

01:14:27.713 --> 01:14:30.590
'Course, you ain't ever
gonna see your crew again.

01:14:30.675 --> 01:14:34.427
- If you're simply hurt, we’re just gonna carry on.
- Which is it, Ensign?

01:14:37.515 --> 01:14:39.349
What's it gonna be?

01:14:39.433 --> 01:14:43.603
Aaaah! Stop!
I'm hurt! I'm hurt!

01:14:43.688 --> 01:14:46.690
That's a brave response.
What's it gonna be?

01:14:49.193 --> 01:14:51.778
Let's try it again, Flea.

01:14:51.863 --> 01:14:55.323
Are you hurt, or are you injured?

01:14:55.408 --> 01:14:57.826
Aaaah!

01:14:57.910 --> 01:15:01.371
- Give it up, man!
- What's it gonna be, Ensign?

01:15:01.455 --> 01:15:04.374
Please. Please.

01:15:04.458 --> 01:15:06.543
Please don't fuckin'
do that anymore.

01:15:06.627 --> 01:15:08.545
Where are they?

01:15:08.629 --> 01:15:11.548
We'll just let you
back in your hole.

01:15:11.632 --> 01:15:13.592
He's done.

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:34.279
Aaaah!

01:15:39.952 --> 01:15:41.870
What is your father's name?

01:15:43.956 --> 01:15:45.874
It's a simple question, Lieutenant.

01:15:45.958 --> 01:15:48.877
No reason not to answer,
unless you wanna bleed.

01:15:48.961 --> 01:15:50.879
What is your father's name?

01:15:50.963 --> 01:15:52.714
Dad.

01:15:56.260 --> 01:15:59.179
How 'bout brothers or sisters?
You got any of them?

01:16:00.681 --> 01:16:02.641
Dick, Jane and Spot.

01:16:07.438 --> 01:16:09.856
You hungry, O'Neil?

01:16:09.941 --> 01:16:13.610
What's your favorite food, honey?
Maybe we can get you something to eat.

01:16:13.694 --> 01:16:16.112
Green eggs and ham.

01:16:16.197 --> 01:16:18.323
"Green eggs and ham. "

01:16:25.665 --> 01:16:28.583
Why didn't you carry out
your wounded, Lieutenant?

01:16:28.668 --> 01:16:31.044
Was he too heavy...

01:16:31.128 --> 01:16:33.588
or were you just plain chicken shit?

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:37.050
You're not gettin' anything out of me.

01:16:37.134 --> 01:16:40.679
You might as well just
put me back in the cage.

01:16:44.558 --> 01:16:48.561
You are in a cage.
Right here, right now.

01:16:48.646 --> 01:16:51.815
I'm sorry.
Am I supposed to be afraid?

01:16:51.899 --> 01:16:55.527
Right down to your worthless womb.
This is my island.

01:17:03.035 --> 01:17:05.453
Jack.

01:17:07.915 --> 01:17:11.001
What? You got a problem
with this, Max?

01:17:13.212 --> 01:17:16.798
Then get the fuck outta here!
Get out!

01:17:31.605 --> 01:17:35.942
He tell you what was comin' in there?

01:17:36.027 --> 01:17:37.944
He didn't tell me shit.

01:17:41.574 --> 01:17:44.993
You think we should go easy
on women, Lieutenant?

01:17:45.077 --> 01:17:47.495
Do ya?

01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:51.207
- Fuck you.
- I'm so glad we agree.

01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:05.388
Two fire teams are still in the woods.
Who's gonna give me a fix on 'em?

01:18:07.099 --> 01:18:10.518
Anyone can stop this.

01:18:10.603 --> 01:18:14.898
Just give me one good piece of intel,
and it ends right here.

01:18:23.824 --> 01:18:26.368
Ohhh! Ohh!

01:18:32.792 --> 01:18:35.543
- Hang tough.
- Hang in there, O'Neil.

01:18:35.628 --> 01:18:39.381
- You got something to tell me?
- Don't do it. Don't do it.

01:18:39.465 --> 01:18:41.383
They're gonna kill you,
O'Neil!

01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:49.349
Ever think about what happens
when you're captured, Lieutenant?

01:18:49.433 --> 01:18:52.060
Oh, yeah.
Just like the men do.

01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:59.567
We practice these things
so you know what to expect.

01:18:59.652 --> 01:19:02.278
Should I practice bleeding too?
Would that make me a better soldier?

01:19:02.363 --> 01:19:05.031
Couldn't hurt.
Not in your case.

01:19:05.116 --> 01:19:07.534
This is bullshit.
It's a fuckin' game, O'Neil.

01:19:07.618 --> 01:19:13.039
Mr. Newberry! You gonna be chivalrous,
put a stop to this abuse?

01:19:13.124 --> 01:19:16.209
- O'Neil, tell him somethin' or I will!
- Don't you tell him shit!

01:19:16.293 --> 01:19:18.461
Aaaah!

01:19:27.638 --> 01:19:29.806
Get him!
Don't let him get up!

01:19:39.650 --> 01:19:42.569
Come on, get up!
Get up! Get up!

01:19:42.653 --> 01:19:46.906
- Get up, O'Neil!
- Keep on him! Hit him while he's dazed.

01:19:46.991 --> 01:19:49.617
Oh, don't you look pretty.

01:19:49.702 --> 01:19:52.704
Don't start somethin'
you can't finish.

01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:59.502
- Come on! Get up, O'Neil!
- Get back, O'Neil!

01:19:59.587 --> 01:20:02.213
- Come on, Jordan.
- Get up. Come on.

01:20:05.176 --> 01:20:07.969
- Lay low!
- Be tough!

01:20:10.681 --> 01:20:13.892
No!

01:20:15.436 --> 01:20:18.771
You're a real fuckin' hero, man.

01:20:33.871 --> 01:20:37.499
Guys, I'm savin' her life...

01:20:37.583 --> 01:20:39.918
and yours.

01:20:41.378 --> 01:20:45.006
Her presence
makes us all vulnerable.

01:20:46.425 --> 01:20:49.344
I don't want you learning
that inconvenient fact...

01:20:49.428 --> 01:20:51.054
under fire.

01:20:52.097 --> 01:20:54.724
- Master Chief.
- Lieutenant!

01:20:54.808 --> 01:20:57.185
Seek life elsewhere.

01:20:57.269 --> 01:20:59.395
Suck my dick!

01:21:07.947 --> 01:21:11.866
Hoo-yah!
Hoo-yah! Hoo-yah! Hoo-yah!

01:21:11.951 --> 01:21:15.703
Hoo-yah! Hoo-yah! Hoo-yah!
Hoo-yah! Hoo-yah! Hoo-yah!

01:21:15.788 --> 01:21:18.540
Hoo-yah! Hoo-yah!
Hoo-yah! Hoo-yah!

01:21:23.796 --> 01:21:26.839
Suck my dick!

01:21:26.924 --> 01:21:31.386
Suck my dick! Suck my dick!
Suck my dick!

01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:35.390
- Move out!
- Suck my dick! Suck my dick!

01:21:43.023 --> 01:21:45.441
It was out of line in there.

01:21:47.653 --> 01:21:50.238
It ain't gonna happen again.

01:21:56.954 --> 01:21:59.205
Yeah, it will.

01:21:59.290 --> 01:22:04.294
Maybe not with you
or with these guys or with me.

01:22:04.378 --> 01:22:06.337
She's not the problem.

01:22:07.506 --> 01:22:09.924
We are.

01:22:10.009 --> 01:22:13.303
She just made it
through S.E.R.E. training.

01:22:13.387 --> 01:22:15.555
- She actually made it.
- Goddamn, that girl is good.

01:22:15.639 --> 01:22:17.557
Oh, by the way, Newsweek called.

01:22:17.641 --> 01:22:21.269
- They want to do a cover story on you and G.I. Jane.
- Wonderful news, Peter.

01:22:21.353 --> 01:22:26.149
Let's talk about this when I get back
to the office. Thank you, darling.

01:22:26.233 --> 01:22:28.610
Newsweek.

01:22:28.694 --> 01:22:33.072
Great. They can come take your picture
at the retirement home in Waco.

01:22:33.157 --> 01:22:35.074
Five of our bases they wanna close.

01:22:35.159 --> 01:22:39.579
D.O.D. tried this trick with Resnik in
California five years ago and it worked.

01:22:39.663 --> 01:22:42.832
He was not re-elected.
You want that to happen in Texas?

01:22:42.916 --> 01:22:45.835
Douglas, nothing's final
till you see it on CNN.

01:22:45.919 --> 01:22:48.838
There's a reason
they gave you that hit list.

01:22:48.922 --> 01:22:51.466
You think they want a horse trade?

01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:54.969
I think they're waitin' for your call.

01:23:12.821 --> 01:23:14.739
Hey.

01:23:14.823 --> 01:23:18.618
Hi, O'Neil. I would've paid money
to have been there.

01:23:18.702 --> 01:23:21.579
- Oh, you heard, huh?
- I think it was on the evening news.

01:23:21.664 --> 01:23:24.248
Geez. Just what
I need–— more P.R.

01:23:24.333 --> 01:23:29.462
Listen, a few of us are
gonna go over to the beach.

01:23:29.546 --> 01:23:31.923
It’s just a barbecue. No big deal.
You wanna come along?

01:23:32.007 --> 01:23:35.385
Well, actually, my crew
has invited me out for a drink.

01:23:35.469 --> 01:23:37.512
Ooh, progress.

01:23:37.596 --> 01:23:41.599
Well, however slow, however painful,
I think they're coming around.

01:23:41.684 --> 01:23:44.185
Give me a few minutes.
I'll give you a lift.

01:23:44.269 --> 01:23:47.188
Okay. Cool.

01:23:51.944 --> 01:23:55.571
I got the next game!

01:23:57.116 --> 01:24:00.201
Another round!
I got this round.

01:24:01.203 --> 01:24:03.162
- You saw Flea?
- Yeah.

01:24:03.247 --> 01:24:05.540
- How's he doin'?
- Think his leg's gonna heal all right.

01:24:05.624 --> 01:24:07.834
I don't know about
the rest of him.

01:24:07.918 --> 01:24:09.836
He went out on medical.
They'll roll him back through.

01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:11.838
Yeah, well,
they may let him back...

01:24:11.922 --> 01:24:14.340
but I don't know if
they'll let him finish.

01:24:14.425 --> 01:24:17.009
If they want you out,
man, they'll find a way.

01:24:17.094 --> 01:24:21.013
- I'm still here.
- Hoo-yah! Great job.

01:24:21.098 --> 01:24:23.558
Oww!

01:24:23.642 --> 01:24:25.893
Yeah?

01:24:25.978 --> 01:24:29.355
You know, O'Neil,
I like you better when you drink.

01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:33.317
You know, Cortez,
I like you better when I drink.

01:24:33.402 --> 01:24:35.820
Shots are up, fellas!

01:24:35.904 --> 01:24:38.531
- Hoo-yah, shots!
- Hoo-yah, shots!

01:24:38.615 --> 01:24:42.076
Joe. Yeah. We need a couple more.

01:24:42.161 --> 01:24:44.412
Here we go.
Everybody's got one?

01:24:44.496 --> 01:24:46.414
All right, people.

01:24:46.498 --> 01:24:48.750
We've been through a lot of shit.
Here's to the living.

01:24:48.834 --> 01:24:51.377
- Who's got the toast?
- I've got one.

01:24:51.462 --> 01:24:55.214
Um, you guys
re-remember this one?

01:24:55.299 --> 01:24:57.592
Suck my dick!

01:24:57.676 --> 01:25:01.012
Hoo-yah!

01:25:01.096 --> 01:25:03.181
Just keep it down, all right?

01:25:03.265 --> 01:25:06.726
Hey, Jordan, I was,
uh, wondering...

01:25:06.810 --> 01:25:08.728
if you, um–—

01:25:08.812 --> 01:25:10.688
you're all right.

01:25:10.773 --> 01:25:14.192
I gotta get out of here.

01:25:18.614 --> 01:25:20.698
# In a world of fire #

01:25:20.783 --> 01:25:22.450
# Really wouldn't want us
to fight for them #

01:25:22.534 --> 01:25:24.744
# 'Cause they're
not even born #

01:25:24.828 --> 01:25:28.122
# We can't even fight
for ourselves anymore #

01:25:28.207 --> 01:25:29.624
# That's why #

01:25:29.708 --> 01:25:33.461
Ain't really none of my business,
but I say leave the bastard.

01:25:33.545 --> 01:25:39.342
# The future is a war#

01:25:42.221 --> 01:25:43.930
# Out the window
went the perfect past #

01:25:44.014 --> 01:25:45.973
# A participle, particle
An atom to smash #

01:25:46.058 --> 01:25:49.811
# And smash and smash and smash
and smash and smash and smash again #

01:25:49.895 --> 01:25:51.395
# Didn't we used to
know ourselves when #

01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:53.648
# Didn't we ever
used to be friends #

01:25:53.732 --> 01:25:57.693
# Before a billion years
went down the drain and that's why #

01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:02.740
# The future is a war#

01:26:03.826 --> 01:26:06.869
# The future is a war ##

01:26:32.437 --> 01:26:35.523
Hey, there. Hi.

01:26:35.607 --> 01:26:38.776
What happened? Where are the guys?

01:26:38.861 --> 01:26:42.613
Well, you know.
I just wasn't into picking up chicks.

01:27:28.243 --> 01:27:30.870
Wait a second.

01:27:38.670 --> 01:27:42.256
On a real world op,
we always use back-ups.

01:27:42.341 --> 01:27:44.550
Two is one,
one is none.

01:27:44.635 --> 01:27:46.552
- Is that understood?
- Yeah!

01:27:46.637 --> 01:27:50.056
O'Neil to C.O. office.

01:27:50.140 --> 01:27:54.352
O'Neil, the C.O. wants
you in his office.

01:27:57.189 --> 01:27:59.357
- Hey.
- Lieutenant, they're waiting.

01:27:59.441 --> 01:28:02.944
This is Admiral Gallow
and Lieutenant Burke...

01:28:03.028 --> 01:28:06.447
from the Judge Advocate
General's office.

01:28:06.531 --> 01:28:08.741
Have a seat, Lieutenant.

01:28:08.825 --> 01:28:12.536
I don't know, uh, a delicate way
to say this, Lieutenant...

01:28:12.621 --> 01:28:14.538
so I'm not going to try.

01:28:14.623 --> 01:28:18.626
Claims have been made
that you have, uh...

01:28:18.710 --> 01:28:24.090
engaged in fraternization
of the same sex variety.

01:28:24.174 --> 01:28:26.634
Specifically that you were...

01:28:26.718 --> 01:28:30.805
"seen in public venues with another
female officer at a time and manner...

01:28:30.889 --> 01:28:33.683
as to suggest conduct
unbecoming an officer. "

01:28:35.477 --> 01:28:38.771
Sir, is someone suggesting
that I'm a lesbian?

01:28:38.855 --> 01:28:41.732
We're not asking
if you are, Lieutenant...

01:28:41.817 --> 01:28:43.901
and you're not required
to respond even if asked.

01:28:43.986 --> 01:28:46.153
This is merely an informal inquiry.

01:28:46.238 --> 01:28:48.739
Where did you get these?

01:28:48.824 --> 01:28:51.742
The source of these photographs
is also a part of our investigation.

01:28:53.078 --> 01:28:56.580
I see. They were
sent anonymously.

01:28:56.665 --> 01:28:59.792
Sir, I'd like to tell you that
this is completely groundless...

01:28:59.876 --> 01:29:03.796
and in no way did anything happen
with Lt. Blondell and myself.

01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:07.174
I find this just as distasteful
as you, Lieutenant.

01:29:07.259 --> 01:29:09.510
You will be required...

01:29:09.594 --> 01:29:13.180
to cooperate with JAG and N.I.S.

01:29:13.265 --> 01:29:16.267
Naturally, you will be given a desk
pending the outcome.

01:29:16.351 --> 01:29:18.436
A desk?
Oh, this is–—

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:23.149
Captain, obviously someone is trying
to sabotage my training.

01:29:23.233 --> 01:29:25.317
You may repeat your training...

01:29:25.402 --> 01:29:27.653
at a future date, if cleared.

01:29:27.738 --> 01:29:31.032
- I can't go through this shit again.
- Ratchet down, Lieutenant.

01:29:32.617 --> 01:29:34.952
I would not choose
to repeat the training, sir...

01:29:35.037 --> 01:29:37.329
nor do I care
to drive a desk...

01:29:37.414 --> 01:29:40.249
pending the outcome of
this malicious allegation.

01:29:40.333 --> 01:29:44.879
Now, I respectfully request you keep me
with my crew or you send me packing.

01:29:44.963 --> 01:29:49.050
That sounded dangerously
like an ultimatum.

01:29:49.134 --> 01:29:52.219
You take it as you will, sir.

01:29:55.182 --> 01:29:58.893
Don't worry.
It's me they're after.

01:30:24.211 --> 01:30:27.088
# I remember#

01:30:27.172 --> 01:30:29.799
# Holding on #

01:30:35.263 --> 01:30:41.143
# All them long
and lonely nights #

01:30:41.228 --> 01:30:44.063
# I've put you through #

01:30:49.194 --> 01:30:52.279
# Somewhere in there #

01:30:52.364 --> 01:30:56.784
# I'm sure I made you cry #

01:31:00.247 --> 01:31:04.625
# But I can't remember#

01:31:04.709 --> 01:31:08.420
# If we said good-bye ##

01:31:10.382 --> 01:31:12.925
Hey.

01:31:13.009 --> 01:31:16.720
I couldn't get
the gas back on.

01:31:23.895 --> 01:31:25.813
I guess you've heard.

01:31:25.897 --> 01:31:27.815
Yeah.

01:31:29.401 --> 01:31:31.360
More than I really wanted to.

01:31:42.747 --> 01:31:47.585
There was a time
I wanted you to fail...

01:31:47.669 --> 01:31:51.505
but it was only
so I could have you close...

01:31:51.590 --> 01:31:53.841
and safe...

01:31:53.925 --> 01:31:57.344
and all to myself.

01:32:00.432 --> 01:32:03.350
But you'd be hell to live with.

01:32:18.867 --> 01:32:22.244
I love you.

01:32:37.135 --> 01:32:39.511
Okay. Here it is.

01:32:44.643 --> 01:32:47.603
- Take a look at these.
- Switch ya.

01:32:53.985 --> 01:32:58.697
Now, this was faxed
to the JAG office Tuesday.

01:32:58.782 --> 01:33:01.200
Arrived on my desk
Wednesday morning.

01:33:01.284 --> 01:33:05.079
What do you see?

01:33:05.163 --> 01:33:07.122
You see this?

01:33:12.754 --> 01:33:15.130
What do you see?

01:33:16.466 --> 01:33:20.094
Take a look on the right.

01:33:20.178 --> 01:33:22.388
- Shit.
- That's right.

01:33:26.017 --> 01:33:28.352
How important is this
to you, Jordan?

01:33:30.272 --> 01:33:34.066
I'm just asking.
I'm just asking.

01:34:00.885 --> 01:34:04.138
- Bridgeport Naval Base.
- Wait. Look at this.

01:34:04.222 --> 01:34:08.892
In Tennessee, the board recommends
closing Fort Meyers...

01:34:08.977 --> 01:34:11.645
and the Brantwood
Air Force Supply Depot.

01:34:11.730 --> 01:34:15.983
In Texas, the board is recommending
no closures of military bases.

01:34:16.067 --> 01:34:19.320
Last week, five bases in Texas were
on the chopping block. This week, none.

01:34:19.404 --> 01:34:22.406
What does that tell you?

01:34:22.490 --> 01:34:25.326
...in a manner equitable
to all states...

01:34:25.410 --> 01:34:28.454
while burdening no one state
with economic hardship.

01:34:28.538 --> 01:34:30.831
First and foremost...

01:34:30.915 --> 01:34:33.792
this commission worked
for the good of the country.

01:34:35.253 --> 01:34:39.089
Of course, we anticipate
some controversy...

01:34:39.174 --> 01:34:41.258
over our recommendations.

01:34:41.343 --> 01:34:44.345
But we remind everybody–—
Senators, Congressmen...

01:34:44.429 --> 01:34:47.348
- Governors alike–—
- Uh, excuse me, Mr. Burnham.

01:34:47.432 --> 01:34:50.517
Now might be a dandy time
for that recess.

01:34:50.602 --> 01:34:53.312
Till noon, everyone.

01:34:56.941 --> 01:34:59.401
Jordan, I heard what happened...

01:34:59.486 --> 01:35:01.737
and I do so very much
want to talk with you...

01:35:01.821 --> 01:35:03.781
but now is scarcely the time.

01:35:03.865 --> 01:35:07.034
I commend you, Senator.
Those were very nice photos.

01:35:09.204 --> 01:35:12.498
Yes, we did have someone
taking shots...

01:35:12.582 --> 01:35:15.959
but for future
publicity purposes.

01:35:16.044 --> 01:35:19.254
I see. So how did they end up
in the Navy's hands?

01:35:19.339 --> 01:35:21.757
Well, you'll have to ask them that.

01:35:22.842 --> 01:35:26.053
If I have to ask
anyone again, Senator...

01:35:26.137 --> 01:35:28.055
I'll be asking on C-SPAN.

01:35:29.933 --> 01:35:33.977
Jordan. Come on.

01:35:34.062 --> 01:35:38.190
Here are the Senator's
case notes.

01:35:38.274 --> 01:35:40.317
Let me have it, boys.
Come on. Quickly, quickly.

01:35:40.402 --> 01:35:42.319
Close the door.

01:35:53.706 --> 01:35:56.083
Jordan, nearly every working day
I'm forced to make decisions...

01:35:56.167 --> 01:35:59.461
that would have Solomon himself
shittin' golf balls...

01:35:59.546 --> 01:36:02.256
and half of those decisions
are about political survival.

01:36:02.340 --> 01:36:04.758
I don't resent that.

01:36:04.843 --> 01:36:08.262
So if you’ve come here lookin' for me
to apologize for keeping alive...

01:36:08.346 --> 01:36:11.682
you better pull up a chair,
'cause you're gonna be here for a while.

01:36:13.184 --> 01:36:16.937
Tell me you didn't sell me out.

01:36:17.021 --> 01:36:21.066
Tell me you didn't sink my whole career
to make you look good.

01:36:21.151 --> 01:36:24.069
Those charges will be dismissed.

01:36:24.154 --> 01:36:28.407
Your career will go forward,
albeit back here in Washington.

01:36:28.491 --> 01:36:31.618
Oh, come on. Don't tell me
you wanted that kind of life.

01:36:31.703 --> 01:36:34.246
Squat-pissing in some
third-world jungle...

01:36:34.330 --> 01:36:36.623
with some guys
looking up your behind.

01:36:36.708 --> 01:36:40.878
I wanted the choice.
That's how it's supposed to be.

01:36:40.962 --> 01:36:44.590
The truth is, the choice isn't yours,
and it isn't mine.

01:36:44.674 --> 01:36:46.592
American families
are just not prepared...

01:36:46.676 --> 01:36:50.387
to have their daughters
and young mothers in harm's way.

01:36:50.472 --> 01:36:53.307
- You don't know that.
- Yes, I do.

01:36:53.391 --> 01:36:55.642
Roper, Paris, Gallup, all the polls,
they all come back the same way.

01:36:55.727 --> 01:36:57.644
What are you saying?

01:36:58.980 --> 01:37:02.149
That a woman's life
is more valuable than a man's?

01:37:02.233 --> 01:37:06.236
That a woman's death
is more hurtful than a man's?

01:37:06.321 --> 01:37:10.741
No politician can afford to let women
come home in body bags...

01:37:10.825 --> 01:37:12.743
especially me.

01:37:17.707 --> 01:37:19.917
It was never gonna happen anyway.

01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:26.632
Then why the fuck did you start me
on all this in the first place?

01:37:27.759 --> 01:37:30.093
Truthfully?

01:37:30.178 --> 01:37:35.766
I never expected you to do so damn well.
I thought you'd ring out in two weeks.

01:37:35.850 --> 01:37:39.269
Bing, bang, it's over,
and we're popular.

01:37:42.732 --> 01:37:44.650
In Washington...

01:37:44.734 --> 01:37:48.028
you don't even need the Ten Commandments
if you’re popular.

01:37:53.117 --> 01:37:57.663
I wonder what Secretary Hayes
would think about this...

01:37:57.747 --> 01:37:59.873
if he was to know
how you dealt me away...

01:37:59.958 --> 01:38:03.669
for bases, for votes.

01:38:03.753 --> 01:38:07.506
What makes you think
he doesn't know?

01:38:12.136 --> 01:38:14.805
Don't even think about playing politics
with me, little darling.

01:38:14.889 --> 01:38:16.807
You'll be up way past your bedtime.

01:38:16.891 --> 01:38:20.352
And don't you think that
I will stand idly by...

01:38:20.436 --> 01:38:24.064
while anyone smears
my good name.

01:38:24.148 --> 01:38:29.152
Now, you get those charges voided,
Senator, and you do it today.

01:38:29.237 --> 01:38:31.405
Or what?

01:38:31.489 --> 01:38:34.366
You like pissed off?

01:38:34.450 --> 01:38:36.952
Watch this.

01:38:41.249 --> 01:38:43.417
Jordan, you're asking me
to unring a bell.

01:38:43.501 --> 01:38:45.419
- I cannot do that.
- I'm not asking.

01:38:45.503 --> 01:38:48.714
Think about what you do before you go in
front of cameras and embarrass yourself.

01:38:48.798 --> 01:38:51.758
- You have no proof!
- Accusations seem to be enough.

01:38:51.843 --> 01:38:55.095
- You taught me that.
- Jordan!

01:38:55.179 --> 01:38:58.181
Hell of a game
of brinkmanship you play.

01:38:58.266 --> 01:39:00.726
I'm not playing games, Senator.

01:39:00.810 --> 01:39:02.936
I gather.

01:39:09.110 --> 01:39:11.194
I'll do it.

01:39:11.279 --> 01:39:15.324
Somehow, I'll get you back in.

01:39:28.713 --> 01:39:30.631
Hey, guys.

01:39:30.715 --> 01:39:33.884
Guys, come here. Take a look at this.
Look who's back in town.

01:39:36.054 --> 01:39:38.305
Lieutenant. Come here.

01:39:42.393 --> 01:39:46.313
I don't know what the hell's
been going on in the last 48 hours.

01:39:46.397 --> 01:39:49.441
Frankly, I don't give a shit.

01:39:49.525 --> 01:39:51.485
Good to see you too,
Master Chief.

01:39:54.072 --> 01:39:56.323
Check out who's back, man.

01:39:56.407 --> 01:39:59.993
- Mr. Wickwire!
- Yes, Master Chief?

01:40:00.078 --> 01:40:02.829
Since the whole world
seems to be awake at 0500...

01:40:02.914 --> 01:40:05.248
why don't you get your class
out here and into formation.

01:40:05.333 --> 01:40:07.668
Might as well
crank it up right now.

01:40:07.752 --> 01:40:10.462
All right, Master Chief
You guys heard him. Let's rock and roll.

01:40:13.549 --> 01:40:17.552
- Ready for round two?
- Hoo-yah, Master Chief.

01:40:35.863 --> 01:40:38.990
- Ready for me?
- You fuck!

01:40:39.075 --> 01:40:42.744
Hey, Newberry, you ever done
one of these...

01:40:42.829 --> 01:40:46.540
Operational Readiness
Exercises before?

01:40:46.624 --> 01:40:49.292
No, Slovnik.
Never operated in the Med.

01:40:49.377 --> 01:40:51.878
Well, it ain't exactly dangerous,
unless you're caught.

01:40:51.963 --> 01:40:55.716
Even though the officials know
we're comin' to test security...

01:40:55.800 --> 01:40:58.218
homeboys guarding the power station
don't know shit.

01:40:58.302 --> 01:41:01.221
Hey, McCool, remember that guy
that got caught...

01:41:01.305 --> 01:41:03.223
settin' charges on the oil platform
years back?

01:41:03.307 --> 01:41:05.892
I don't know, man. What?
Thomas? Taylor? I don't know.

01:41:05.977 --> 01:41:09.813
Well, he tried to explain
it was just an exercise.

01:41:09.897 --> 01:41:13.358
Well, he was talking English and
they was talkin' Arabic. So, you know.

01:41:13.443 --> 01:41:15.861
- Did he die in prison or–-
- I don't know.

01:41:15.945 --> 01:41:18.822
Well, I hope you assholes are
as ready as you think you are.

01:41:18.906 --> 01:41:21.742
You girls are so full of shit.
No offense, O'Neil.

01:41:21.826 --> 01:41:23.744
Jordan, what do you think
about that, huh?

01:41:23.828 --> 01:41:26.163
Spending time
in some Arab prison.

01:41:26.247 --> 01:41:29.875
After six months with you, Slovnik,
I might just fucking volunteer.

01:41:29.959 --> 01:41:33.754
Now hear this. Now hear this.

01:41:33.838 --> 01:41:37.466
This is the Captain speaking. We have been
directed to break from training exercises...

01:41:37.550 --> 01:41:40.761
and join the battle group Tango Chaser.

01:41:40.845 --> 01:41:43.388
We are proceeding
towards hostile waters.

01:41:43.473 --> 01:41:47.100
Department heads make ready
for battle conditions.

01:41:47.185 --> 01:41:49.102
That is all.

01:41:49.187 --> 01:41:52.773
- Iran or Iraq?
- Libya.

01:41:52.857 --> 01:41:55.609
At 0230, A D.O.D. satellite
dropped out of orbit.

01:41:55.693 --> 01:41:57.736
Normally, that's not
a cause for such concern...

01:41:57.820 --> 01:42:01.656
except this baby decided to drop
in Mr. Gadhafi's backyard.

01:42:01.741 --> 01:42:05.660
What's more, I've got a range
of search units–— Task Unit Scorpion–—

01:42:05.745 --> 01:42:08.580
already en route
to the strike zone.

01:42:08.664 --> 01:42:13.293
My problem is that their exit plan
has gone to total shit.

01:42:13.377 --> 01:42:16.254
Your C.R.T.'s are the closest unit
with the right capabilities.

01:42:16.339 --> 01:42:19.132
Your job would be
to facilitate extraction.

01:42:19.217 --> 01:42:22.177
Now, Master Chief,
if for one second...

01:42:22.261 --> 01:42:25.847
you don't think they're ready for
whatever reason, you speak to me now.

01:42:27.683 --> 01:42:30.602
- We'll be fine, sir.
- Excellent.

01:42:32.855 --> 01:42:37.234
At present, we are three miles
off the Libyan coast... here.

01:42:37.318 --> 01:42:40.487
Carrier support will remain
within striking distance.

01:42:40.571 --> 01:42:42.489
Their call sign is Las Vegas.

01:42:42.573 --> 01:42:46.326
Now, your unit is to make an
over-the-beach insertion here...

01:42:46.410 --> 01:42:49.496
link up with the Ranger Recovery
Unit Scorpion...

01:42:49.580 --> 01:42:52.499
and escort them out
without being detected.

01:42:52.583 --> 01:42:56.002
Have the Rangers recovered
the device yet, Skipper?

01:42:56.087 --> 01:42:58.171
Satellite power cells
have been located.

01:42:58.256 --> 01:43:00.173
They're humping 'em out
now as we speak.

01:43:00.258 --> 01:43:02.425
Scorpion Leader,
Scorpion Leader.

01:43:02.510 --> 01:43:04.427
This is Las Vegas.

01:43:04.512 --> 01:43:09.975
Be advised:
extract team under way.

01:43:10.059 --> 01:43:14.020
Advise your E.T.A.
Over.

01:43:14.105 --> 01:43:16.022
Copy, Las Vegas.
Copy, Las Vegas.

01:43:16.107 --> 01:43:18.358
E.T. A approximately
one hour, 20 minutes.

01:43:18.442 --> 01:43:21.987
- Over.
- Copy that, Scorpion Leader.

01:43:22.071 --> 01:43:24.948
Be advised rendezvous
point of extraction team...

01:43:25.032 --> 01:43:30.370
at the following coordinates:
3-2-1-5, 1-4-8-6.

01:43:30.454 --> 01:43:32.372
I say again, 3–—

01:43:32.456 --> 01:43:35.625
Are we talking the KH family here, sir?
The subhunter satellite?

01:43:35.710 --> 01:43:37.794
Go ahead, Lieutenant. Fill us in.

01:43:37.879 --> 01:43:42.382
The KH-12 Bravos
are nuclear-powered.

01:43:42.466 --> 01:43:45.385
The onboard plutonium
is designed to survive re-entry.

01:43:45.469 --> 01:43:48.179
Some kind of
protective shroud.

01:43:48.264 --> 01:43:51.474
The plutonium
is, uh, weapons grade.

01:43:51.559 --> 01:43:53.518
You know the drill,
Master Chief.

01:43:53.603 --> 01:43:55.729
- Unfortunately, I do, Skipper.
- Carry on.

01:44:02.904 --> 01:44:05.322
Who's not ready?

01:44:13.664 --> 01:44:16.666
Inner door dogged.

01:44:16.751 --> 01:44:19.669
Understand.
Inner door closed and dogged.

01:44:22.298 --> 01:44:24.215
Mark and start.

01:45:06.509 --> 01:45:08.426
- Clear. Clear.
- Clear.

01:45:08.511 --> 01:45:10.428
Okay. Mr. McCool,
set up comms.

01:45:13.557 --> 01:45:16.017
Lieutenant,
let's go find 'em.

01:45:23.317 --> 01:45:25.652
Set up a perimeter.

01:45:47.258 --> 01:45:49.175
Lieutenant.

01:45:49.260 --> 01:45:51.636
9-0-1 's. Two o'clock.

01:45:51.721 --> 01:45:54.014
Got it.

01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:05.191
I still hold four.

01:46:14.410 --> 01:46:16.953
Holy shit!

01:46:20.791 --> 01:46:24.544
Border patrol.
A little ratty-assed, but still.

01:46:24.628 --> 01:46:27.839
Yeah, parked right in the middle
of the extract corridor.

01:46:27.923 --> 01:46:31.468
I got 25, maybe 30 with mixed weapons–—
AK's, SKS's...

01:46:31.552 --> 01:46:33.678
a couple RPG's.

01:46:33.763 --> 01:46:36.389
Scorpion's gonna need
to be redirected.

01:46:36.474 --> 01:46:38.892
Mr. Wickwire, come in.

01:46:41.854 --> 01:46:44.314
Do you read me,
Mr. Wickwire?

01:46:44.398 --> 01:46:47.484
- I can't raise the beach. You got 'em?
- Stand by.

01:46:47.568 --> 01:46:50.278
Wick, you copy?
Wick.

01:46:52.323 --> 01:46:55.700
Negative. I'll keep eyes on you.
Fall back, Radio Chaser.

01:46:55.785 --> 01:46:58.995
No, Lieutenant.
I got the better eyeball. You go back.

01:46:59.080 --> 01:47:00.914
- Chief, I think that I–—
- Lieutenant, go.

01:47:00.998 --> 01:47:03.541
Roger that.

01:47:08.339 --> 01:47:11.883
Wait a minute. Take cover.
Take cover and freeze.

01:47:14.345 --> 01:47:17.806
You got a vehicle coming towards you,
coming up the hill.

01:47:21.018 --> 01:47:24.145
Stand fast.
He might blow right by ya.

01:47:28.984 --> 01:47:31.778
Nope, we're not that lucky.

01:47:31.862 --> 01:47:33.780
Stay down.

01:47:45.626 --> 01:47:47.794
Lieutenant,
if this goes down...

01:47:47.878 --> 01:47:51.589
make it silent.

01:47:51.674 --> 01:47:55.635
Control your breathing.

01:47:55.719 --> 01:47:58.471
Comin' at ya.

01:48:00.224 --> 01:48:02.142
Twenty-five feet.

01:48:02.226 --> 01:48:04.811
He's a big boy. You're gonna have
to take him from behind.

01:48:04.895 --> 01:48:06.813
Twenty

01:48:09.567 --> 01:48:11.693
Fifteen.
Movin' to your left.

01:48:13.737 --> 01:48:17.448
Ten feet.
Right behind ya.

01:48:29.503 --> 01:48:31.838
He's turned around.

01:48:31.922 --> 01:48:34.424
- You want me to do it?
- Negative.

01:48:34.508 --> 01:48:36.509
I'll do what I have to do,
but it's my call.

01:48:36.594 --> 01:48:38.845
Here he comes.

01:48:40.598 --> 01:48:43.016
Eight feet. Six.

01:48:44.268 --> 01:48:46.811
- He's got ya. I'm taking him.
- No.

01:48:47.855 --> 01:48:49.939
Fuck!

01:48:50.024 --> 01:48:52.525
Clear out. Get back to the beach.

01:48:52.610 --> 01:48:54.611
Go! Go!

01:49:04.872 --> 01:49:08.291
That's the Chief.

01:49:16.634 --> 01:49:20.553
Chaser, this is Chaser Alpha.
Do you read me?

01:49:20.638 --> 01:49:23.223
- Comm to Chaser. Do you got 'em?
- Copy that, Chaser.

01:49:23.307 --> 01:49:26.726
This is your lucky day, L.T.
Stand by, Chaser.

01:49:26.810 --> 01:49:28.728
Hostile activity,
this location.

01:49:28.812 --> 01:49:32.899
I say again, this location too hot.

01:49:32.983 --> 01:49:35.860
Request you advise coordinates
for new extract.

01:49:35.945 --> 01:49:39.072
- Over.
- O'Neil, slow down. Slow down.

01:49:39.156 --> 01:49:41.115
Chaser Alpha,
loud and clear.

01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:43.326
Will relay your traffic
to Las Vegas control. Over.

01:49:43.410 --> 01:49:46.704
Also request gunship support
for extraction.

01:49:46.789 --> 01:49:48.706
Location to follow.
Over.

01:49:48.791 --> 01:49:51.584
Roger that, Chaser
Alpha. Will relay priority to Las Vegas.

01:49:51.669 --> 01:49:54.671
Give me the coordinates when
you got 'em. We're outta here, guys.

01:49:54.755 --> 01:49:56.756
We gotta get those boats out to sea.

01:49:56.840 --> 01:49:59.842
If we don't get those boats back
to the extract site, wherever that is...

01:49:59.927 --> 01:50:01.761
Scorpion's mission goes down.

01:50:01.845 --> 01:50:04.597
Leave one boat with my team.
I'll wait for the Chief.

01:50:17.152 --> 01:50:19.445
RPG's.
He's fucked.

01:50:19.530 --> 01:50:21.864
Sounds like Chief's
running a little late.

01:50:21.949 --> 01:50:25.118
We gotta go. O'Neil, retrace
your tracks. Cortez, pick up the rear.

01:50:25.202 --> 01:50:27.912
- We're going back in there for body parts?
- You're damn right we are.

01:50:27.997 --> 01:50:29.706
Do the headwork with me.

01:50:29.790 --> 01:50:32.542
If he's on the run, he's not coming back
this way to lead them to us.

01:50:32.626 --> 01:50:34.961
Right? Now look here.

01:50:35.045 --> 01:50:38.589
If we’re here,
and I left the Chief here...

01:50:38.674 --> 01:50:40.591
I think he's gonna
make his way southwest...

01:50:40.676 --> 01:50:43.219
down this wash and out to sea.

01:50:43.304 --> 01:50:46.389
If we hump it, we can get there
and knock out any pursuit.

01:50:46.473 --> 01:50:48.766
You work this out with the Chief
ahead of time, O'Neil...

01:50:48.851 --> 01:50:50.977
or are you just clairvoyant?

01:50:51.061 --> 01:50:53.021
No, but it's what I'd do.

01:50:54.648 --> 01:50:57.984
- I don't know. It sounds like a fucking crapshoot.
- Hash.

01:50:59.653 --> 01:51:01.279
- What's up?
- Your team, take three boats.

01:51:01.363 --> 01:51:05.450
- Wait for new extraction location from Las Vegas.
- Roger that.

01:51:05.534 --> 01:51:08.328
The rest of us, we're gonna stay,
make sure the Chief gets out.

01:51:26.930 --> 01:51:31.684
This is Las Vegas.
Message to follow.

01:51:31.769 --> 01:51:36.647
New extract at 0-2-6-7-5-2.

01:51:37.733 --> 01:51:42.779
I say again,
0-2-6-7-5-2.

01:51:42.863 --> 01:51:45.114
- Over.
- Copy, Las Vegas.

01:51:45.199 --> 01:51:50.661
But those boats will be there
this time, correct? Over.

01:51:50.746 --> 01:51:53.664
That's a roger.
Sorry for the last.

01:51:53.749 --> 01:51:56.376
It won't happen again.
This is Las Vegas, out.

01:51:56.460 --> 01:51:58.419
Yeah, Scorpion, out.

01:51:59.630 --> 01:52:02.256
Let's go.

01:52:10.724 --> 01:52:13.393
Here?

01:52:15.396 --> 01:52:18.898
I think it's perfect for a parallel
ambush. We can suck them right in.

01:52:22.820 --> 01:52:24.779
Yeah. Let's do it.

01:53:11.994 --> 01:53:13.911
Wickwire.
Come in, Wickwire.

01:53:26.383 --> 01:53:28.301
What ya got, Cortez?

01:53:28.385 --> 01:53:30.595
Nothin'.

01:53:30.679 --> 01:53:33.764
O'Neil, it's Wick.

01:53:33.849 --> 01:53:38.102
- Can you read my mind? What do you think?
- I don't see any other way.

01:53:38.187 --> 01:53:41.814
There was foliage back to the south that
was good cover, but that's high ground.

01:53:41.899 --> 01:53:44.484
I think he'd just be trapped.

01:53:44.568 --> 01:53:48.404
I don't know, Wick. Shit.

01:53:50.699 --> 01:53:54.035
Well, I see the Chief, and he's got
a boatload of trouble comin' our way.

01:53:55.537 --> 01:53:58.331
Boys, let's get ready
to rock and roll.

01:54:09.259 --> 01:54:11.636
Hold it, guys. Don't get trigger happy.
I got him at 30 yards.

01:54:11.720 --> 01:54:14.096
Keep comin', baby.
Keep comin'.

01:54:14.181 --> 01:54:16.307
Come on.

01:54:16.391 --> 01:54:19.060
Twenty yards. Come on, Chief. We're
suckin' 'em–— We're suckin' 'em in.

01:54:20.604 --> 01:54:24.440
Hold 'em up.
Hold 'em up.

01:54:24.525 --> 01:54:28.110
- He's hit! He's down!
- He's hit! Gotta blow it now!

01:54:28.195 --> 01:54:30.112
Negative, Slovnik.
He's in the kill zone.

01:54:30.197 --> 01:54:34.033
Las Vegas, this is Chaser Alpha.
We have heavy, hostile–—

01:54:37.955 --> 01:54:41.374
Repeat, immediate extraction.

01:54:41.458 --> 01:54:44.460
He's hit again!

01:54:45.546 --> 01:54:48.172
Fire, fire!
Fire, fire! Cover him!

01:54:48.257 --> 01:54:52.009
Fire, fire, fire, fire,
fire, fire, fire, fire!

01:54:52.094 --> 01:54:54.512
This is Chaser Alpha
to Las Vegas! Come in!

01:54:56.640 --> 01:54:59.892
- McCool, I'm going in!
- Shit! Wick, give her some cover!

01:55:08.485 --> 01:55:10.695
- Yah-hoo!
- She made it!

01:55:14.116 --> 01:55:16.284
Come on, come on,
come on!

01:55:21.081 --> 01:55:25.835
Got ya!

01:55:29.673 --> 01:55:31.924
McCool!

01:55:32.009 --> 01:55:34.719
Newberry, give me smoke!
Get him out of here!

01:55:34.803 --> 01:55:37.555
- Let's go!
- Whoo-hoo!

01:55:37.639 --> 01:55:40.850
Stay down!
Stay down!

01:55:45.689 --> 01:55:49.442
That's it! Let's fall back!
Fall back! We're finished.

01:55:54.865 --> 01:55:57.700
- Your guys?
- Sounds like the right area.

01:56:25.979 --> 01:56:28.814
Christ!

01:56:44.748 --> 01:56:48.000
- Over here! Move, move, move!
- Give me a hand!

01:56:53.382 --> 01:56:57.468
Let's go! Let's go!
Take the airwaves! Stay down, Chief!

01:56:59.221 --> 01:57:02.682
- Break it off!
- Come on! Get in there!

01:57:04.267 --> 01:57:07.061
- Four heartbeat!
- Push it! Push it! Push it!

01:57:07.145 --> 01:57:09.814
- Six heartbeat!
- I'm looking for an I.V.

01:57:09.898 --> 01:57:11.857
I'm trying to find an I.V. here.

01:57:11.942 --> 01:57:14.193
He's alive!
Give me some room!

01:57:14.277 --> 01:57:16.696
- Slovnik, give me some room!
- All aboard!

01:57:16.780 --> 01:57:19.115
All bodies in!
Let's get the hell out of Dodge!

01:57:35.298 --> 01:57:38.884
- What a goat fuck.
- How's the Chief doin'?

01:57:38.969 --> 01:57:41.929
He's all right.

01:57:48.270 --> 01:57:51.772
Hey, O'Neil! I'd go to war
with you any day.

01:57:57.571 --> 01:57:59.488
I'll never live this one down.

01:57:59.573 --> 01:58:02.199
Tango-Niner, are you
boys en route with cargo? Over.

01:58:02.284 --> 01:58:04.034
Sundown, this is Team Leader.

01:58:04.119 --> 01:58:05.745
We have the cargo safely in hand...

01:58:05.829 --> 01:58:07.830
and just tell whoever's listening
that we're coming home.

01:58:07.914 --> 01:58:09.081
Tango-Niner out.

01:58:25.140 --> 01:58:27.683
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you, Master Chief.

01:58:31.938 --> 01:58:40.112
- Welcome aboard, sir.
- Thank you, Master Chief.

01:58:43.867 --> 01:58:47.161
- Welcome aboard, Sergeant.
- Thank you, Master Chief.

01:58:50.540 --> 01:58:52.833
Welcome aboard, sir.

01:59:03.720 --> 01:59:05.638
Welcome aboard, ma'am.

01:59:46.054 --> 01:59:49.348
# I remember#

01:59:49.432 --> 01:59:53.477
# Holding on to you #

01:59:58.608 --> 02:00:03.237
# All them long
and lonely nights #

02:00:03.321 --> 02:00:06.198
# I've put you through #

02:00:11.621 --> 02:00:14.373
# Somewhere in there #

02:00:14.457 --> 02:00:19.003
Welcome to the SEALS
C.R.T. selection program.

02:00:19.087 --> 02:00:24.967
You have volunteered for the most
intensive military training known to man.

02:00:25.051 --> 02:00:27.386
Attention!

02:00:27.470 --> 02:00:31.056
I now turn you over
to my Command Master Chief...

02:00:31.141 --> 02:00:33.475
John James Urgayle.

02:00:34.603 --> 02:00:39.273
# I recall all those nights #

02:00:39.357 --> 02:00:44.403
I never saw
a wild thing sorry for itself

02:00:44.487 --> 02:00:47.990
A bird will fall
frozen dead from a bough...

02:00:49.993 --> 02:00:55.497
without ever having
felt sorry for itself.

02:00:55.582 --> 02:00:57.666
Boat crews,
stand by your boats!

02:00:57.751 --> 02:01:01.420
Move your asses!

02:01:01.504 --> 02:01:05.549
# Was I just off somewhere #

02:01:05.634 --> 02:01:08.719
#Just to hide #

02:01:12.515 --> 02:01:17.227
# But I can't remember#

02:01:17.312 --> 02:01:21.690
# If we said good-bye #

02:01:54.474 --> 02:01:57.643
# I only miss you here #

02:01:57.727 --> 02:02:01.230
# Every now and then #

02:02:05.443 --> 02:02:10.906
# Like the soft breeze
blowing on #

02:02:10.991 --> 02:02:14.493
# Through my curtains #

02:02:19.082 --> 02:02:22.960
# Each November#

02:02:23.044 --> 02:02:26.380
# I break down and cry #

02:02:30.260 --> 02:02:35.139
# But I can't remember#

02:02:35.223 --> 02:02:38.809
# If we said good-bye #

02:02:43.940 --> 02:02:47.526
# I can't remember#

02:02:47.610 --> 02:02:52.448
# If we said good-bye #

02:02:52.532 --> 02:02:55.451
# Ohhh #

02:02:55.535 --> 02:02:59.705
# I can't remember#

02:02:59.789 --> 02:03:03.959
# If we said good-bye #

02:03:08.256 --> 02:03:10.966
# Good-bye ##

02:03:11.051 --> 02:03:16.221
# The future is a war#

02:03:19.601 --> 02:03:21.351
# Out the window went
the perfect past #

02:03:21.436 --> 02:03:23.062
# A participle, particle
An atom to smash #

02:03:23.146 --> 02:03:27.274
# And smash and smash and smash
and smash and smash and smash again #

02:03:27.358 --> 02:03:29.109
# Didn't we used to
know ourselves when #

02:03:29.194 --> 02:03:30.903
# Didn't we ever
used to be friends #

02:03:30.987 --> 02:03:34.823
# Before a billion years
went down the drain and that's why #

02:03:38.036 --> 02:03:43.832
# The future is a war#

02:03:46.544 --> 02:03:48.253
# Losin' already
Losin' everything #

02:03:48.338 --> 02:03:50.422
# We got swastikas
hidden in magazines #

02:03:50.507 --> 02:03:57.930
# Sewed in the label
of your slave-labor clothes #

02:03:58.014 --> 02:03:59.932
# And that's why #

02:04:02.894 --> 02:04:08.774
# The future is a war#

02:04:11.528 --> 02:04:13.237
# Men prove worthy of our fears #

02:04:13.321 --> 02:04:15.114
# Their strength diminishes
more every year#

02:04:15.198 --> 02:04:17.199
# As they side with the enemy
and throw down their spears #

02:04:17.283 --> 02:04:20.786
# Leaving women and children
alone right here to face #

02:04:20.870 --> 02:04:22.996
# The future #

02:04:23.081 --> 02:04:25.040
# That's why #

02:04:28.044 --> 02:04:48.230
# The future is a war#
