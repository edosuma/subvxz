00:01.830 --> 00:03.290
JAMES LINCOLN: Once it reaches
its critical temperature,

00:03.290 --> 00:05.330
it will actually levitate.

00:05.330 --> 00:07.750
DAVID WILCOCK: This, to me,
looks like a flying saucer.

00:07.750 --> 00:09.590
Could we have something

00:09.590 --> 00:12.260
that potentially
people could ride in?

00:12.260 --> 00:14.090
LINCOLN:
If you have enough magnetism,

00:14.090 --> 00:16.510
there's no limit
to how big this can be.

00:16.510 --> 00:17.930
Unbelievable.

00:17.930 --> 00:21.140
We're seeing a very intriguing
connection here.

00:21.140 --> 00:24.270
At this ancient site
of Teotihuacan,

00:24.270 --> 00:28.860
there may be a location in which
exotic technology was used

00:28.860 --> 00:31.690
to create
an electromagnetic field.

00:31.690 --> 00:33.360
LINCOLN:
At very low temperatures,

00:33.360 --> 00:35.280
mercury would display
the same behavior.

00:35.280 --> 00:38.700
Mercury, in fact, was the first
superconductor ever discovered.

00:38.700 --> 00:41.790
WILCOCK: Archeologists found
a literal river

00:41.790 --> 00:44.250
of liquid mercury
at Teotihuacan.

00:44.250 --> 00:47.630
So there absolutely does
appear to be

00:47.630 --> 00:50.920
an advanced ancient civilization
that was here,

00:50.920 --> 00:56.220
and this is the actual spaceport
of this civilization.

00:56.220 --> 00:58.140
♪ ♪

01:28.580 --> 01:30.880
NARRATOR:
Mexico City.

01:30.880 --> 01:36.470
Beneath the current‐day capital
of Mexico lie the ruins

01:36.470 --> 01:40.300
of the ancient Aztec metropolis
known as Tenochtitlan.

01:42.220 --> 01:45.560
The Aztecs dominated
much of central Mexico

01:45.560 --> 01:49.690
from the 14th
to the 16th century AD,

01:49.690 --> 01:52.900
and Tenochtitlan is considered

01:52.900 --> 01:56.360
to be their first
official settlement‐‐

01:56.360 --> 01:58.780
an incredibly sophisticated city

01:58.780 --> 02:02.530
featuring a grid system
of canals and causeways.

02:04.410 --> 02:07.040
But according to
their historical texts,

02:07.040 --> 02:10.920
the Aztec civilization
did not originate here.

02:12.750 --> 02:14.550
DR. EDWIN BARNHART:
The Aztecs say they started

02:14.550 --> 02:18.010
from this place up in the north
called Chicomoztoc.

02:18.010 --> 02:20.180
It was a cave,
and inside that cave,

02:20.180 --> 02:22.760
it had seven different caverns,

02:22.760 --> 02:26.100
and there were said to be
seven different tribes.

02:26.100 --> 02:30.150
And the Aztecs say they were
part of the seven tribes

02:30.150 --> 02:34.480
that came from the seven
chambers of Chicomoztoc.

02:34.480 --> 02:37.490
NARRATOR: While Chicomoztoc
was once thought

02:37.490 --> 02:40.360
to be a mythological place,

02:40.360 --> 02:44.910
some scholars believe
archaeological evidence suggests

02:44.910 --> 02:48.870
that it really did exist,
and is located at the site

02:48.870 --> 02:53.420
of the ancient pyramid complex
known today as Teotihuacan.

02:57.260 --> 02:59.800
BARNHART: The place of
seven caves, we think

02:59.800 --> 03:04.300
maybe that has actually been
located archaeologically

03:04.300 --> 03:09.270
at the site of the main temple
of Teotihuacan,

03:09.270 --> 03:11.350
called the Pyramid of the Sun,

03:11.350 --> 03:14.650
which sits just north
of the Valley of Mexico.

03:14.650 --> 03:18.820
Underneath it is actually a cave

03:18.820 --> 03:22.320
with seven different spots
that it extends out into.

03:22.320 --> 03:24.620
And that's where the Aztecs said

03:24.620 --> 03:27.330
their original ancestors
came from.

03:30.620 --> 03:32.830
NARRATOR:
In the 16th century,

03:32.830 --> 03:37.550
Spanish chronicler Geronimo de
Mendieta recorded the legends

03:37.550 --> 03:40.220
of the local native population.

03:40.220 --> 03:43.260
According to their accounts,
the Aztec believed

03:43.260 --> 03:44.850
that they were
fashioned by a group

03:44.850 --> 03:48.100
of stranded gods
within these seven caves.

03:48.100 --> 03:52.940
JONATHAN YOUNG: Mendieta wrote
an account of Aztec legend.

03:52.940 --> 03:56.440
In this report, he describes
a giant flint knife

03:56.440 --> 03:58.360
landing on the Earth.

03:58.360 --> 04:00.940
And the Earth was trembling
and shaking

04:00.940 --> 04:04.070
as this enormous
flint knife landed.

04:06.410 --> 04:10.950
Then some 1,600 gods
disgorged from this thing,

04:10.950 --> 04:15.330
and they are responsible for
launching Aztec civilization.

04:17.880 --> 04:20.420
BARNHART: The Aztecs talk about
the many gods

04:20.420 --> 04:24.630
coming down to Earth
and creating humans.

04:24.630 --> 04:30.350
They create them out of bone,
ash and their own blood.

04:30.350 --> 04:34.140
And they make them somewhat
in their own image.

04:34.140 --> 04:37.520
But they make them specifically
so that they will honor them

04:37.520 --> 04:38.860
and they will serve them.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.940
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS:
All of a sudden,

04:41.940 --> 04:44.950
there is a description
of a giant flint knife

04:44.950 --> 04:50.540
that descended from the sky,
and somebody emerged out of it.

04:50.540 --> 04:53.660
One has to wonder

04:53.660 --> 04:57.830
whether or not
our ancestors were witness

04:57.830 --> 05:00.500
to a landing of some type
of a craft.

05:00.500 --> 05:06.130
If so, then
the Aztec story suggests

05:06.130 --> 05:08.390
that, some point in our history,

05:08.390 --> 05:12.600
extraterrestrials
created mankind.

05:12.600 --> 05:17.690
And something very strange
was going on at Teotihuacan.

05:17.690 --> 05:22.440
NARRATOR: Located just 30 miles
northeast of Mexico City,

05:22.440 --> 05:26.070
the Teotihuacan complex
encompasses nearly

05:26.070 --> 05:30.370
eight square miles, and is dated
to the first century AD.

05:30.370 --> 05:34.000
It is the oldest
and most sophisticated city

05:34.000 --> 05:38.210
of Mesoamerica, an area that
extends from northern Mexico

05:38.210 --> 05:40.340
down through Central America.

05:43.130 --> 05:45.590
The civilization
predated the Maya

05:45.590 --> 05:47.930
by at least a hundred years.

05:47.930 --> 05:50.760
At its peak, it was said
to have supported

05:50.760 --> 05:53.390
nearly 100,000 residents.

05:53.390 --> 05:58.900
It was also the largest city
in the entire Western Hemisphere

05:58.900 --> 06:03.690
prior to the 15th century,
and served as the major commerce

06:03.690 --> 06:06.110
and religious center
for the region.

06:06.110 --> 06:08.660
BARNHART:
The significance of Teotihuacan

06:08.660 --> 06:11.160
cannot be overstated.

06:11.160 --> 06:14.120
It is the Rome of Mesoamerica.

06:14.120 --> 06:18.830
The things that Teotihuacan did
set the pattern

06:18.830 --> 06:21.330
for all other city‐states
after it.

06:23.130 --> 06:25.010
NARRATOR: The central features
of the complex

06:25.010 --> 06:27.670
are two large pyramids,

06:27.670 --> 06:33.390
known as the Pyramid of the Sun
and the Pyramid of the Moon,

06:33.390 --> 06:38.060
as well as a temple dedicated
to Quetzalcoatl,

06:38.060 --> 06:40.520
the feathered serpent.

06:40.520 --> 06:44.860
These structures
stand alongside a thoroughfare

06:44.860 --> 06:49.200
referred to as
the Avenue of the Dead.

06:49.200 --> 06:53.490
Over 200 smaller buildings,
platforms and pyramids

06:53.490 --> 06:56.580
are found adjacent
to the Avenue.

06:56.580 --> 06:59.250
And there are thousands
of living quarters

06:59.250 --> 07:02.040
just outside the complex.

07:02.040 --> 07:05.840
But as incredible
as Teotihuacan is,

07:05.840 --> 07:09.130
no one knows exactly
who built this metropolis

07:09.130 --> 07:12.300
or what happened
to its occupants.

07:12.300 --> 07:15.930
BARNHART:
Teotihuacan, despite its size,

07:15.930 --> 07:18.890
has no hieroglyphs whatsoever.

07:18.890 --> 07:20.640
There are other cultures
in Mesoamerica

07:20.640 --> 07:22.480
that were using writing systems.

07:22.480 --> 07:24.690
There's nothing like that
at Teotihuacan.

07:24.690 --> 07:28.530
So we don't really have
a clear history

07:28.530 --> 07:32.110
of what happened at Teotihuacan.

07:32.110 --> 07:36.830
And we can't really find
evidence of their rulers.

07:46.920 --> 07:51.050
...to develop a complete,
huge complex, citadel...

07:58.060 --> 08:00.810
WILL HART: We have such
a sophisticated site

08:00.810 --> 08:06.690
that embodies engineering
principles, craftsmanship, art.

08:06.690 --> 08:09.110
Where did it originate?

08:09.110 --> 08:12.400
Where are the smaller versions
of this?

08:12.400 --> 08:14.490
Well, we don't find any.

08:14.490 --> 08:18.910
So, we don't have a progression,
an evolution,

08:18.910 --> 08:20.500
to show where this came from.

08:20.500 --> 08:25.380
So we have to ask:
where did it come from?

08:25.380 --> 08:27.040
WILCOCK: We've become
conditioned to look

08:27.040 --> 08:29.750
at these awesome works
of stone architecture and think,

08:29.750 --> 08:32.510
"Oh, primitive people did that,
and they used primitive methods

08:32.510 --> 08:34.220
with primitive technology."

08:34.220 --> 08:38.640
But we have to rethink
the fundamental assumptions,

08:38.640 --> 08:41.680
and come to a greater and
greater level of understanding

08:41.680 --> 08:44.770
that the technology required to
build these artifacts, in fact,

08:44.770 --> 08:47.810
is greater than anything
that they possessed.

08:51.780 --> 08:54.280
NARRATOR: But based on
the local lore of the region,

08:54.280 --> 08:57.870
ancient astronaut theorists
suggest that the original

08:57.870 --> 09:02.120
builders of the site
may not have been human at all.

09:02.120 --> 09:05.170
YOUNG: All of the people
in this area felt

09:05.170 --> 09:10.550
this city was a sacred site
connected to a divine realm.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.880
The population along the coast
were the Totonac.

09:13.880 --> 09:17.430
They believed that
the place was founded by

09:17.430 --> 09:20.970
a dozen sky gods‐‐
the lords of thunder.

09:25.230 --> 09:29.400
Other nearby Mesoamerican
cultures had their own theories.

09:29.400 --> 09:33.650
One associated the site
with the feathered serpent god

09:33.650 --> 09:36.990
Quetzalcoatl, who was said
to have come from Venus.

09:41.700 --> 09:45.120
It was the Aztecs
who gave the place its name,

09:45.120 --> 09:48.120
Teotihuacan‐‐
City of the Gods.

09:53.420 --> 09:56.050
The name speaks for itself.

09:56.050 --> 09:59.930
So one has to ask the question:
what gods?

10:04.390 --> 10:06.390
Who were they?

10:06.390 --> 10:09.810
Were they just a figment
of our ancestors' imagination,

10:09.810 --> 10:12.690
or did they see someone?

10:12.690 --> 10:14.570
Did somebody visit them

10:14.570 --> 10:17.570
to essentially jumpstart
civilization?

10:21.780 --> 10:24.790
NARRATOR:
If Teotihuacan truly was founded

10:24.790 --> 10:28.000
by extraterrestrial visitors
in the remote past,

10:28.000 --> 10:30.170
just how old might the site be?

10:32.420 --> 10:35.420
And could this ancient city
still hold evidence

10:35.420 --> 10:37.840
of alien visitation?

10:43.430 --> 10:44.930
NARRATOR:
Every year,

10:44.930 --> 10:47.020
millions of tourists
visit the ancient ruins

10:47.020 --> 10:49.850
of Teotihuacan.

10:49.850 --> 10:53.060
But most are unaware that
many of the buildings

10:53.060 --> 10:54.860
they see throughout the complex

10:54.860 --> 10:59.570
have been erected
upon much older structures.

10:59.570 --> 11:03.200
The Pyramid of the Sun
is believed to consist of

11:03.200 --> 11:06.080
a total of five layers
of pyramids,

11:06.080 --> 11:10.870
one built on top of the next,
like a Russian nesting doll.

11:10.870 --> 11:14.670
Curiously, the oldest layers
are said to exhibit

11:14.670 --> 11:16.960
the most advanced
building techniques.

11:19.220 --> 11:22.300
Evidence of this older stonework
can still be found

11:22.300 --> 11:24.760
scattered in parts of
the complex,

11:24.760 --> 11:27.930
including
a largely off‐limits area

11:27.930 --> 11:30.560
behind the Pyramid
of the Feathered Serpent.

11:34.480 --> 11:37.730
This enormous stone
has been very finely cut

11:37.730 --> 11:40.240
by the inhabitants
of Teotihuacan.

11:40.240 --> 11:43.660
NARRATOR:
Local researcher Marco Vigato

11:43.660 --> 11:47.200
has gained unprecedented access
to this part of the site.

13:06.660 --> 13:09.580
NARRATOR: When archaeologist
Leopoldo Batres

13:09.580 --> 13:13.250
started excavating
the site in 1884,

13:13.250 --> 13:16.370
he discovered
the pyramids were buried

13:16.370 --> 13:19.000
in upwards of 12 feet of earth.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.710
He surmised that
only a catastrophic event

13:22.710 --> 13:24.510
could account for
the devastation.

13:26.800 --> 13:30.140
HART: It was covered
under a deep layer of earth.

13:30.140 --> 13:31.600
And we have to ask why.

13:31.600 --> 13:33.890
How did it get covered
in so much dirt?

13:33.890 --> 13:37.600
It would require
an enormous amount of time

13:37.600 --> 13:39.020
‐for nature to do it.
‐(thunder crashes)

13:40.820 --> 13:43.570
Unless you have
a catastrophic flooding.

13:45.650 --> 13:47.450
DAVID CHILDRESS:
You have to ask yourself:

13:47.450 --> 13:49.280
was there some big cataclysm

13:49.280 --> 13:51.950
that occurred here
in prehistory?

13:51.950 --> 13:55.540
Possibly even the Great Flood

13:55.540 --> 13:58.960
that is spoken of in various
mythologies around the world?

13:58.960 --> 14:02.340
This could mean that Teotihuacan

14:02.340 --> 14:05.550
is actually many, many
thousands of years older

14:05.550 --> 14:07.720
than what archaeologists say.

14:09.470 --> 14:11.760
NARRATOR: According to
the accounts recorded

14:11.760 --> 14:13.510
by Spanish chroniclers

14:13.510 --> 14:16.890
when they initially made contact
with the locals,

14:16.890 --> 14:20.480
the Aztec believed that
they were one of seven tribes

14:20.480 --> 14:23.020
to be created by
the gods at a time

14:23.020 --> 14:25.110
after the world
had been wiped clean

14:25.110 --> 14:27.150
due to a catastrophic event.

14:30.110 --> 14:32.530
They were the last group
to leave the caves

14:32.530 --> 14:37.250
where they were created in order
to repopulate the world.

14:37.250 --> 14:39.870
YOUNG: Teotihuacan
is where they believe

14:39.870 --> 14:43.290
the gods had created humanity,
had created all things,

14:43.290 --> 14:48.260
had created the sun, which they
referred to as the "fifth sun."

14:48.260 --> 14:52.720
The Aztecs had a cosmology
that involved five ages.

14:52.720 --> 14:56.220
They were solar ages,
about 5,000 years long,

14:56.220 --> 14:59.390
and each one terminates
in a disaster.

14:59.390 --> 15:03.610
The fourth age was called
the "Water Sun,"

15:03.610 --> 15:07.320
and it was presided over
by the goddess Chalchiuhtlicue.

15:07.320 --> 15:11.990
She was the goddess who,
at the end of the age,

15:11.990 --> 15:13.910
‐poured the deluge on the Earth,
‐(thunder crashes)

15:13.910 --> 15:16.410
and flooded everything.

15:21.120 --> 15:22.750
NARRATOR:
If the origins of the site

15:22.750 --> 15:24.590
are thousands of years older

15:24.590 --> 15:27.300
than mainstream
archaeologists suggest,

15:27.300 --> 15:29.720
might this help explain why,

15:29.720 --> 15:32.300
even after decades
of excavations,

15:32.300 --> 15:34.220
they still haven't
found evidence

15:34.220 --> 15:36.390
of who the site's rulers were?

15:36.390 --> 15:39.350
And could it also shed new light

15:39.350 --> 15:42.440
on recent
perplexing discoveries?

15:44.400 --> 15:47.020
October, 2003.

15:48.610 --> 15:50.740
(thunder crashes)

15:50.740 --> 15:53.820
Torrential rains
sweep through the ruins

15:53.820 --> 15:56.780
of this ancient
pyramid complex...

15:56.780 --> 15:58.080
(thunder crashes)

15:58.080 --> 16:00.960
...leaving a three‐foot‐wide
sinkhole

16:00.960 --> 16:04.420
at the foot of one of the site's
most important structures:

16:04.420 --> 16:07.460
the Temple of
the Feathered Serpent.

16:09.460 --> 16:13.180
Archaeologists immediately
begin exploring the cavity.

16:16.680 --> 16:18.510
BARNHART:
What they found is the tunnel

16:18.510 --> 16:20.310
leading from outside the temple

16:20.310 --> 16:24.480
all the way to about centerline
underneath the temple.

16:24.480 --> 16:26.310
It was very filled in,

16:26.310 --> 16:29.070
probably by the Teotihuacanos
themselves.

16:29.070 --> 16:31.320
But it's been a slow process
to excavate.

16:32.650 --> 16:35.110
Halfway through down the tunnel,

16:35.110 --> 16:37.490
we find these two chambers
on either side.

16:42.500 --> 16:44.580
As they continued down,

16:44.580 --> 16:47.460
they found three more chambers
at the end.

16:47.460 --> 16:49.500
And those hold
some incredible things.

16:52.130 --> 16:55.380
There were many jade statues
in there.

16:56.800 --> 16:58.350
And ceramics.

17:01.850 --> 17:05.230
NARRATOR:
In April, 2015,

17:05.230 --> 17:07.900
after nearly 12 years
of excavations,

17:07.900 --> 17:11.320
archaeologist Sergio Gómez
and his team

17:11.320 --> 17:13.900
make another shocking discovery.

17:13.900 --> 17:17.620
Directly underneath
the center of the pyramid,

17:17.620 --> 17:20.950
they have located a vast pool
of liquid mercury.

17:24.160 --> 17:26.120
WILCOCK:
What makes this so interesting

17:26.120 --> 17:31.750
is that the mercury cannot exist
in its native form in nature.

17:33.970 --> 17:37.090
There is a natural minerallac
material called "cinnabar,"

17:37.090 --> 17:38.800
and in order to get mercury,

17:38.800 --> 17:42.310
you have to extract it
out of the cinnabar,

17:42.310 --> 17:46.560
which requires a complex process
involving high temperatures.

17:46.560 --> 17:48.940
TSOUKALOS:
It's a highly toxic element.

17:48.940 --> 17:51.320
It is difficult to extract.

17:51.320 --> 17:55.570
So, the logistics behind this
are incredible.

17:55.570 --> 17:57.780
How was it transported there?

17:57.780 --> 18:01.410
Where did it come from
and for what purpose?

18:01.410 --> 18:08.210
Also, how did our ancestors
handle liquid mercury

18:08.210 --> 18:09.420
without them dying out?

18:11.670 --> 18:14.510
Interestingly enough,
the only other site

18:14.510 --> 18:18.010
that features liquid mercury
is in China,

18:18.010 --> 18:23.220
inside the tomb
of the first emperor.

18:23.220 --> 18:28.480
How come there is liquid mercury
in a tomb in China,

18:28.480 --> 18:33.730
and now they've discovered
liquid mercury

18:33.730 --> 18:36.110
in Teotihuacan?

18:36.110 --> 18:39.990
One has to ask the question:
what was it used for?

18:39.990 --> 18:44.660
NARRATOR: Liquid mercury
is a superconductor,

18:44.660 --> 18:49.290
and in our modern technological
age, this class of elements

18:49.290 --> 18:51.960
is being used
in revolutionary applications

18:51.960 --> 18:57.050
such as free‐energy generation,
advanced medical imaging

18:57.050 --> 19:01.300
and cutting‐edge
transportation projects.

19:01.300 --> 19:05.060
But why would there be
vast amounts of mercury

19:05.060 --> 19:08.930
found under a nearly
2,000‐year‐old pyramid?

19:08.930 --> 19:12.360
Could it have served
a technological purpose?

19:20.570 --> 19:23.490
NARRATOR:
May, 2013.

19:23.490 --> 19:27.200
Just two years prior
to the astounding discovery

19:27.200 --> 19:29.750
of liquid mercury
at Teotihuacan,

19:29.750 --> 19:33.250
archaeologist Sergio Gómez
and his team

19:33.250 --> 19:35.670
made another curious find:

19:35.670 --> 19:38.960
hundreds of gold‐colored
metallic spheres

19:38.960 --> 19:41.050
scattered in the same tunnel

19:41.050 --> 19:43.800
beneath the Temple
of the Feathered Serpent.

19:43.800 --> 19:46.680
The spheres ranged in diameter

19:46.680 --> 19:49.310
from just one inch
up to five inches.

19:51.730 --> 19:53.060
There were hundreds of them.

19:53.060 --> 19:56.320
On the exterior,
they were burned pyrite.

19:56.320 --> 19:59.940
And on the interior,
they're mostly clay.

19:59.940 --> 20:02.360
In fact, the entire chamber
seems to have

20:02.360 --> 20:06.530
flecks of this golden pyrite
or fool's gold all over it.

20:06.530 --> 20:08.660
I've never seen
anything like it.

20:08.660 --> 20:13.580
I do not know what these things
are, what their meaning is.

20:13.580 --> 20:16.340
To my knowledge, we've never
found a chamber like that

20:16.340 --> 20:19.000
anywhere in Mesoamerica,

20:19.000 --> 20:21.510
certainly nowhere
in Teotihuacan.

20:21.510 --> 20:25.010
It's an enigma, and neither I
nor any of my colleagues

20:25.010 --> 20:26.510
know what to make of it.

20:29.810 --> 20:33.190
One of the findings of the
analysis of these golden spheres

20:33.190 --> 20:38.190
was that there are substances in
them that can't be identified,

20:38.190 --> 20:42.610
can't be related to other
known Earth substances.

20:42.610 --> 20:46.240
The archeologists themselves
cannot explain

20:46.240 --> 20:47.990
how these were formed,

20:47.990 --> 20:51.290
why is there anomalous organic
material within them,

20:51.290 --> 20:54.920
or what purpose did they serve.

20:54.920 --> 20:57.540
We have to wonder
what these pyramids

20:57.540 --> 20:59.590
and this whole structure
is about.

20:59.590 --> 21:03.010
What are these
golden spheres about?

21:03.010 --> 21:07.470
And why is there mercury
inside of this pyramid?

21:07.470 --> 21:10.720
It's almost like some
kind of alien technology

21:10.720 --> 21:15.020
is being used at Teotihuacan,
but we don't understand it.

21:15.020 --> 21:18.480
NARRATOR:
The recent finds of mercury

21:18.480 --> 21:21.030
and the inexplicable
golden spheres

21:21.030 --> 21:24.070
only add to the mystery
of the site.

21:24.070 --> 21:29.410
In 1906, archaeologist
Leopoldo Batres discovered

21:29.410 --> 21:34.210
layers of mica throughout
the Teotihuacan complex.

21:34.210 --> 21:37.830
The discovery of entire sheets
of this material,

21:37.830 --> 21:41.670
which is used in electrical
and thermal applications,

21:41.670 --> 21:44.800
has baffled researchers,
as it has not been found

21:44.800 --> 21:48.090
in any other
ancient architecture.

21:48.090 --> 21:51.310
In a couple of different places
in Teotihuacan,

21:51.310 --> 21:54.230
we've discovered sheets of mica.

21:54.230 --> 21:58.650
The first reports of them
were supposedly that

21:58.650 --> 22:02.530
Leopold Batres had found
these large sheets of mica

22:02.530 --> 22:05.440
on top of the Temple of the Sun.

22:07.070 --> 22:09.110
NARRATOR:
Since that first discovery,

22:09.110 --> 22:13.240
entire chambers lined with mica
have allegedly been found

22:13.240 --> 22:16.290
at different locations
along the Avenue of the Dead,

22:16.290 --> 22:20.290
but the areas are now off limits
to visitors.

22:20.290 --> 22:26.260
Ever since the late 1990s,
the Mexican government...

23:06.840 --> 23:11.800
NARRATOR: In the 1970s, author
and researcher Erich von Daniken

23:11.800 --> 23:16.600
got a firsthand look into
one of these mica chambers.

23:16.600 --> 23:20.140
I was brought there by a local
archeologist who loved my books,

23:20.140 --> 23:22.230
and he said he can show me
a mystery.

23:22.230 --> 23:25.940
There is a room,
and the room has a ceiling,

23:25.940 --> 23:27.780
and has, of course, four walls.

23:27.780 --> 23:31.070
And in the four walls,
you see mica.

23:31.070 --> 23:33.740
This mica is put in
artificially.

23:33.740 --> 23:36.580
It's like an insulation.

23:36.580 --> 23:39.290
First, you have stone,
then you have a level of mica,

23:39.290 --> 23:42.500
about ten centimeter,
and then again stone.

23:42.500 --> 23:46.670
From this chamber where
the mica is, there is a hole,

23:46.670 --> 23:49.800
and the hole is insulated
with mica.

23:49.800 --> 23:52.970
And I have been told
that the hole goes

23:52.970 --> 23:55.140
inside the great pyramid‐‐

23:55.140 --> 23:57.600
the Pyramid of the Sun
in Teotihuacan.

23:57.600 --> 24:00.310
That will be the next discovery.

24:02.690 --> 24:05.190
NARRATOR: Today, mica is used
as a heat shield

24:05.190 --> 24:08.320
in electronic
and aerospace industries.

24:08.320 --> 24:11.570
It has the unique properties
of being a good insulator

24:11.570 --> 24:15.200
of electricity as well as
a conductor of heat,

24:15.200 --> 24:18.330
and it is able
to resist temperatures

24:18.330 --> 24:21.160
upwards of 1,800 degrees
Fahrenheit.

24:23.040 --> 24:26.460
We use mica today
with high technology.

24:26.460 --> 24:29.170
So one has to wonder,

24:29.170 --> 24:33.380
why is there a mica chamber
at Teotihuacan?

24:33.380 --> 24:35.390
It's very brittle,

24:35.390 --> 24:39.430
but it's incredibly,
incredibly heat resistant.

24:39.430 --> 24:45.230
Why was there any need
for mica in the first place?

24:45.230 --> 24:48.690
GEORGE NOORY: There seems
to be a correlation, though,

24:48.690 --> 24:52.110
between mica, liquid mercury,

24:52.110 --> 24:56.490
and these orbs or spheres
that all seem to point

24:56.490 --> 25:00.200
to some high technology usage.

25:00.200 --> 25:02.000
What did they know,

25:02.000 --> 25:05.000
how did they know it
is anybody's guess,

25:05.000 --> 25:07.330
but it just sounds like
they needed these materials

25:07.330 --> 25:09.670
for something,
and they used them.

25:11.510 --> 25:15.840
We have to wonder,
are we looking at a technology?

25:15.840 --> 25:17.890
We see components of it

25:17.890 --> 25:20.970
that don't make sense
just for a primitive culture.

25:20.970 --> 25:22.810
The pyramids

25:22.810 --> 25:25.390
and the various components
could've been part of

25:25.390 --> 25:28.110
a sophisticated
system of technology.

25:28.110 --> 25:31.400
NARRATOR: Ancient
astronaut theorists propose

25:31.400 --> 25:34.450
that the mercury, mica,

25:34.450 --> 25:38.280
and gold‐colored spheres
may be somehow connected

25:38.280 --> 25:42.750
and serve as components
of a larger device.

25:42.750 --> 25:45.460
They suggest
that further evidence

25:45.460 --> 25:48.500
can be found at the site
by examining the remnants

25:48.500 --> 25:51.800
of an ancient explosion.

25:56.300 --> 25:59.220
NARRATOR:
Teotihuacan.

25:59.220 --> 26:02.430
Along the Avenue of the Dead,

26:02.430 --> 26:04.430
multiple structures
show evidence

26:04.430 --> 26:06.350
of a catastrophic fire

26:06.350 --> 26:09.940
that consumed
portions of the temple complex.

26:09.940 --> 26:12.440
The damage has been attributed

26:12.440 --> 26:15.990
to an uprising
at the end of the sixth century,

26:15.990 --> 26:19.910
just before the population
entirely vanished

26:19.910 --> 26:21.240
without a trace.

26:23.950 --> 26:26.000
This structure, in particular,

26:26.000 --> 26:28.500
in spite of the many
modern restorations...

26:44.520 --> 26:48.060
NARRATOR: According to
archaeologist Leopoldo Batres,

26:48.060 --> 26:50.980
who surveyed the site
in the late 19th century,

26:50.980 --> 26:53.860
the damage seemed too extensive

26:53.860 --> 26:57.070
to be attributed
to simple torch flames,

26:57.070 --> 27:00.860
leading researchers to explore
alternative explanations.

27:18.840 --> 27:21.510
NARRATOR:
Could the curious finds

27:21.510 --> 27:23.930
of mica and mercury at the site

27:23.930 --> 27:27.640
help corroborate the theory
that the burn marks we see

27:27.640 --> 27:29.230
along the Avenue of the Dead

27:29.230 --> 27:32.310
are from some sort
of mechanical explosion?

27:32.310 --> 27:36.650
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

27:36.650 --> 27:39.740
and they suggest that
like the Great Pyramid at Giza

27:39.740 --> 27:42.820
and other sites
throughout the globe,

27:42.820 --> 27:45.910
the structures at Teotihuacan
may have once served

27:45.910 --> 27:48.830
as an electromagnetic
power plant.

27:51.420 --> 27:53.330
Researchers proposed
that the pyramids

27:53.330 --> 27:56.380
constructed around the world
are, in fact, power plants.

27:56.380 --> 27:58.880
This is based
on our new knowledge

27:58.880 --> 28:00.760
that they, in fact, are designed

28:00.760 --> 28:03.180
to tap the resonant power
of the Earth

28:03.180 --> 28:06.310
and then to distribute it
around the world.

28:06.310 --> 28:10.060
Teotihuacan matches
precisely this model.

28:10.060 --> 28:11.980
It's built over caverns,

28:11.980 --> 28:15.440
it had liquid mercury and mica
incorporated into its design,

28:15.440 --> 28:18.480
and we know that the gods
came and left from this place.

28:18.480 --> 28:21.570
So when we put
all the pieces together,

28:21.570 --> 28:24.870
we're looking at Teotihuacan
as yet another example

28:24.870 --> 28:26.950
of the power plants of the gods.

28:28.580 --> 28:31.960
If it was a technological system

28:31.960 --> 28:35.540
that was generating
a lot of energy, at some point,

28:35.540 --> 28:38.130
there could've been
a malfunction in it.

28:38.130 --> 28:42.130
If there was energy,
the mica found at the site

28:42.130 --> 28:44.180
was supposed to shield it,

28:44.180 --> 28:47.350
and mercury‐‐
was also found at the site‐‐

28:47.350 --> 28:49.470
seems to have been used.

28:49.470 --> 28:52.230
Perhaps we had
some kind of accident there

28:52.230 --> 28:54.100
at some point in time.

29:02.030 --> 29:05.110
NARRATOR: If Teotihuacan served
as an ancient power plant,

29:05.110 --> 29:08.160
generating
electromagnetic energy,

29:08.160 --> 29:10.740
just what role
did the liquid mercury‐‐

29:10.740 --> 29:12.580
recently discovered
at the site‐‐

29:12.580 --> 29:14.290
play in such a scenario?

29:16.670 --> 29:19.540
There's stories of mercury
being used in spacecraft.

29:21.630 --> 29:23.970
And some of
the ancient Indian epics

29:23.970 --> 29:27.180
talk about mercury
as part of the vimanas

29:27.180 --> 29:29.140
and the mechanics
of these craft.

29:29.140 --> 29:33.230
So here we have the idea
that this mercury

29:33.230 --> 29:36.900
that's being found
at archeological sites

29:36.900 --> 29:40.940
is really part of the propulsion
of some of the craft

29:40.940 --> 29:44.530
that the extraterrestrials
were using here on Earth.

29:48.700 --> 29:50.240
NARRATOR:
Los Angeles, California.

29:52.410 --> 29:56.040
February, 2017.

29:56.040 --> 30:00.340
Physicist James Lincoln
has been experimenting

30:00.340 --> 30:02.340
with superconductors
like mercury

30:02.340 --> 30:04.420
and the levitation effects
produced

30:04.420 --> 30:08.260
in the presence of strong
electromagnetic fields,

30:08.260 --> 30:10.510
such as those
suspected of being generated

30:10.510 --> 30:12.930
by the ancient pyramid
power plants.

30:14.850 --> 30:17.850

David Wilcock

30:17.850 --> 30:19.600
visited his laboratory

30:19.600 --> 30:22.520
to see how electromagnetism
creates an environment

30:22.520 --> 30:24.610
that allows mercury to levitate.

30:24.610 --> 30:27.240
‐Good to meet you.
‐Nice to meet you. Yes.

30:27.240 --> 30:28.740
NARRATOR:
The demonstration will utilize

30:28.740 --> 30:30.820
a conventional
superconductor material

30:30.820 --> 30:33.490
in place of mercury
due to its toxicity.

30:36.830 --> 30:38.460
What am I about to see here?

30:38.460 --> 30:41.500
Now, one of the signatures
of a superconductor

30:41.500 --> 30:43.960
is that once it reaches
its critical temperature,

30:43.960 --> 30:46.300
as being it's cold enough,

30:46.300 --> 30:49.840
it will actually levitate
over a magnetic field.

30:49.840 --> 30:51.680
That is unbelievable.

30:51.680 --> 30:54.810
LINCOLN: We can actually
make it go around the track.

30:54.810 --> 30:58.310
This is the signature behavior
of any superconductor

30:58.310 --> 31:00.480
in the presence
of a magnetic field.

31:00.480 --> 31:03.230
It generates electricity
flowing in loops

31:03.230 --> 31:04.980
inside of a superconductor.

31:04.980 --> 31:07.240
‐That's why it floats.
‐WILCOCK: Wow.

31:07.240 --> 31:10.200
There's not really
an upper limit

31:10.200 --> 31:11.740
to how fast this thing can go.

31:11.740 --> 31:13.700
WILCOCK:
So there's a flow of current

31:13.700 --> 31:16.160
in the disc as it's going?

31:16.160 --> 31:19.250
LINCOLN: Yes. Once these
electric currents are generated,

31:19.250 --> 31:21.250
it's free and permanent

31:21.250 --> 31:23.630
and can last
as long as you can keep it cold.

31:23.630 --> 31:26.960
WILCOCK:
Wow. Very, very cool.

31:26.960 --> 31:30.300
So if you had mercury here

31:30.300 --> 31:32.340
and got it really, really cold,
th‐this same type

31:32.340 --> 31:34.470
of effect would occur, or would
we notice anything different?

31:34.470 --> 31:36.260
LINCOLN: We would be able
to get the same effect

31:36.260 --> 31:38.310
if we managed
to get this cold enough.

31:38.310 --> 31:41.060
‐Okay. ‐Mercury is also
a superconductor.

31:41.060 --> 31:42.520
In fact, it was
the first superconductor

31:42.520 --> 31:44.020
‐ever discovered.
‐Okay.

31:44.020 --> 31:47.650
And this one can be anywhere,
any orientation,

31:47.650 --> 31:49.820
whether I put it on
forward or backwards

31:49.820 --> 31:53.450
or even upside down,
it still works.

31:56.620 --> 31:58.540
And here we're seeing it

31:58.540 --> 32:02.580
held perfectly in place,
zipping along on its own.

32:02.580 --> 32:04.670
Now that is truly remarkable.

32:07.300 --> 32:10.800
This, to me, looks
like a flying saucer.

32:10.800 --> 32:13.510
It does look a lot like
a flying saucer.

32:13.510 --> 32:15.640
In fact, you can get it
to avoid obstacles,

32:15.640 --> 32:18.640
like you would want
from any hovering technology.

32:18.640 --> 32:21.140
So, here I'm placing some
little debris on the track,

32:21.140 --> 32:24.690
and let's see if it, uh, can get
over this, uh, pile of sticks.

32:24.690 --> 32:25.940
WILCOCK:
Sure.

32:28.190 --> 32:29.860
‐LINCOLN: No trouble.
‐No resistance.

32:29.860 --> 32:31.780
Yeah, so now you can imagine it
flying over forests,

32:31.780 --> 32:33.610
if it was large enough,

32:33.610 --> 32:36.740
and if you managed to have
enough magnetism on the surface

32:36.740 --> 32:38.240
for that to happen.

32:38.240 --> 32:39.450
Unbelievable.

32:42.870 --> 32:46.790
If this technology
could be scaled up,

32:46.790 --> 32:50.630
could we have something that
potentially people could be able

32:50.630 --> 32:53.430
to ride in as a craft?

32:53.430 --> 32:56.390
LINCOLN: Yeah. If you keep
the superconductor cold.

32:56.390 --> 32:58.100
‐WILCOCK: Huh.
‐LINCOLN: And you imagine

32:58.100 --> 32:59.890
‐it has to have a chamber
of liquid nitrogen. ‐Right.

32:59.890 --> 33:02.270
And you have enough magnetism
over a surface,

33:02.270 --> 33:06.440
then there's no upper limit
to how big this can be.

33:06.440 --> 33:08.650
So, if there were
some way to make this

33:08.650 --> 33:13.240
a self‐contained
continuously cooling unit,

33:13.240 --> 33:15.780
theoretically at least,
would it be able

33:15.780 --> 33:18.490
to keep doing what it's doing
right now indefinitely?

33:18.490 --> 33:20.620
LINCOLN:
Well, yes.

33:20.620 --> 33:23.000
It will last, uh,
as long as it stays cold.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.710
People have had superconductors
lasting for years already

33:25.710 --> 33:27.670
with currents flowing in them.

33:27.670 --> 33:29.880
And there's a lot of places
that are cold enough

33:29.880 --> 33:31.340
that that would work.

33:31.340 --> 33:33.670
‐For example, outer space.
‐WILCOCK: Right.

33:36.010 --> 33:39.050
We're seeing a very
intriguing connection here.

33:39.050 --> 33:43.310
Teotihuacan may be a location

33:43.310 --> 33:45.810
in which exotic
technology was used

33:45.810 --> 33:48.860
to create
an electromagnetic field.

33:48.860 --> 33:51.270
And therefore,
the area around the pyramid

33:51.270 --> 33:54.400
may have been an area
in which levitation

33:54.400 --> 33:56.990
was much easier
for a flying saucer

33:56.990 --> 33:59.530
that involved liquid mercury
as a fuel.

34:01.580 --> 34:05.580
Teotihuacan may have been
the Cape Canaveral of its day.

34:07.370 --> 34:08.960
Today most space facilities

34:08.960 --> 34:12.840
are built as close
to the equator as possible

34:12.840 --> 34:16.720
to take advantage
of the Earth's rotation.

34:16.720 --> 34:20.220
And Teotihuacan is
relatively near the equator,

34:20.220 --> 34:23.310
and so it would be an ideal spot

34:23.310 --> 34:26.480
as a spaceport
for extraterrestrial vehicles

34:26.480 --> 34:28.850
to land and take off.

34:31.480 --> 34:34.360
NARRATOR:
Is it possible that Teotihuacan

34:34.360 --> 34:37.700
functioned as some sort
of extraterrestrial spaceport,

34:37.700 --> 34:42.450
one capable of generating
electromagnetic power

34:42.450 --> 34:46.120
to support interstellar craft
fueled by liquid mercury?

34:46.120 --> 34:49.540
Perhaps further evidence
can be found

34:49.540 --> 34:54.840
by examining a planetary map
encoded in the city's layout.

35:00.260 --> 35:03.560
NARRATOR:
March, 2017.

35:03.560 --> 35:08.230
Archaeologists continue to dig
under the pyramid complex,

35:08.230 --> 35:11.100
in an attempt to answer
the many mysteries

35:11.100 --> 35:14.150
of Teotihuacan.

35:14.150 --> 35:17.110
The discoveries
of liquid mercury,

35:17.110 --> 35:20.070
walls lined with mica,

35:20.070 --> 35:24.030
and strange artifacts
like the golden spheres

35:24.030 --> 35:27.330
point to the possibility
that an advanced society

35:27.330 --> 35:29.330
once occupied this city.

35:29.330 --> 35:34.710
But some researchers suggest
even greater clues can be found

35:34.710 --> 35:39.130
by examining the layout
of the entire complex.

35:39.130 --> 35:44.390
Three of the major structures
contained within Teotihuacan

35:44.390 --> 35:48.060
have been found to line up with
the three belt stars of Orion,

35:48.060 --> 35:51.190
a connection
that is also mirrored

35:51.190 --> 35:55.730
in the layout of the pyramids
at the Giza Plateau in Egypt.

35:55.730 --> 35:59.360
And the positioning
of the main thoroughfare,

35:59.360 --> 36:01.490
known as the Avenue of the Dead,

36:01.490 --> 36:04.280
is directed toward
the Pleiades star cluster.

36:06.530 --> 36:09.080
But perhaps the most
intriguing connection

36:09.080 --> 36:11.460
was proposed in the 1970s

36:11.460 --> 36:15.750
by American engineer
Hugh Harleston Jr.

36:15.750 --> 36:18.380
HART:
In 1972, Hugh Harleston

36:18.380 --> 36:21.260
undertook a study of the site.

36:21.260 --> 36:23.720
And he was trying
to determine mathematically

36:23.720 --> 36:26.140
if he could break down
or discover

36:26.140 --> 36:29.310
a standard unit of measure
at Teotihuacan.

36:29.310 --> 36:31.890
The conclusion that
Harleston came up with

36:31.890 --> 36:35.810
in all his measurements,
he found consistent numbers.

36:35.810 --> 36:38.980
And he discovered
that they reflected

36:38.980 --> 36:43.110
mathematical principles
that involved units, intervals,

36:43.110 --> 36:46.160
and the spacing of the planets.

36:46.160 --> 36:51.080
WILCOCK: He found the actual
derivation of the solar system

36:51.080 --> 36:53.870
with the planets, their correct
distances from one another,

36:53.870 --> 36:56.790
actually laid out

36:56.790 --> 37:00.420
in the spacings of the monuments
at this complex.

37:00.420 --> 37:04.300
NARRATOR: Harleston noted
that the intervals

37:04.300 --> 37:07.600
between the major structures
corresponded exactly

37:07.600 --> 37:10.930
to the distances
between the various planets.

37:10.930 --> 37:14.140
WILCOCK:
There is a very clear rationale

37:14.140 --> 37:16.350
for the positioning
of these artifacts,

37:16.350 --> 37:18.940
and it's only once you
get into their measurements

37:18.940 --> 37:21.740
that you start to see
compelling proof

37:21.740 --> 37:23.950
that this is intended to be

37:23.950 --> 37:27.070
an accurate map
of our solar system.

37:29.660 --> 37:32.160
NARRATOR: Even the distance
of the asteroid belt

37:32.160 --> 37:35.370
between Mars and Jupiter
was correctly plotted

37:35.370 --> 37:38.630
by the diversion of the San Juan
River through the site.

37:38.630 --> 37:41.550
CHILDRESS:
Harleston believed

37:41.550 --> 37:44.670
that a man‐made canal
that was cut

37:44.670 --> 37:47.550
through Teotihuacan
represented the asteroid belt,

37:47.550 --> 37:51.100
which was not something known
to ancient people.

37:53.270 --> 37:56.060
Whoever built Teotihuacan,

37:56.060 --> 37:58.560
they had full knowledge
of our solar system

37:58.560 --> 38:02.190
and knowledge that ancient
people could not have had.

38:02.190 --> 38:05.490
NARRATOR:
Three and a half miles away,

38:05.490 --> 38:08.070
on top of the Cerro Gordo
mountain range,

38:08.070 --> 38:13.660
Harleston also located the ruins
of the Temple of Xóchitl,

38:13.660 --> 38:17.170
which fell directly in sight
line of the Avenue of the Dead.

38:19.500 --> 38:21.250
CHILDRESS:
Harleston believed

38:21.250 --> 38:24.670
that this temple was
mathematically showing

38:24.670 --> 38:27.970
that there was
a planet beyond Pluto,

38:27.970 --> 38:30.390
twice as far as Pluto,

38:30.390 --> 38:34.680
that was somehow orbiting around
our solar system.

38:34.680 --> 38:38.650
NARRATOR:
Curiously, in 2016,

38:38.650 --> 38:40.650
planetary scientists

38:40.650 --> 38:43.980
from the California Institute
of Technology announced

38:43.980 --> 38:47.200
that they had found preliminary
evidence of the existence

38:47.200 --> 38:50.780
of an unknown planet
beyond Pluto.

38:50.780 --> 38:54.080
Would such a revelation
give further credence

38:54.080 --> 38:57.460
to the idea that the inhabitants
of Teotihuacan

38:57.460 --> 39:00.500
had intimate knowledge
of our solar system,

39:00.500 --> 39:03.630
and that the site served
as an ancient spaceport,

39:03.630 --> 39:08.550
one that might still
be active today?

39:15.270 --> 39:18.890
NARRATOR:
May 4, 2015.

39:18.890 --> 39:23.570
A tourist visiting the ancient
pyramid complex of Teotihuacan

39:23.570 --> 39:26.570
takes a photograph featuring
the Pyramid of the Sun.

39:26.570 --> 39:28.320
(camera whirs, clicks)

39:28.320 --> 39:32.410
He thinks nothing of it
until he later reviews the photo

39:32.410 --> 39:36.200
and notices two strange objects
hovering over the pyramid.

39:39.500 --> 39:41.830
Upon closer examination,

39:41.830 --> 39:46.300
they appear to be silver
disk‐shaped craft.

39:46.300 --> 39:49.470
What's strange about
the two UFOs photographed

39:49.470 --> 39:52.720
above the Pyramid of the Sun
at Teotihuacan is

39:52.720 --> 39:55.100
‐that only ten seconds later,
‐(camera clicks)

39:55.100 --> 40:01.640
a second photograph was taken
and those two objects were gone.

40:01.640 --> 40:05.480
So, clearly, we're not talking
about Mylar balloons here.

40:05.480 --> 40:07.940
There's nothing floating
in the sky anymore.

40:07.940 --> 40:11.200
And if they would have been
Mylar balloons, well,

40:11.200 --> 40:15.070
they don't move that fast
to just (whistles) disappear.

40:17.410 --> 40:19.750
There has been a long history

40:19.750 --> 40:23.330
of UFO sightings
and unusual events

40:23.330 --> 40:27.800
in Teotihuacan, particularly
around the pyramids,

40:27.800 --> 40:31.050
which perhaps
are somehow attracting UFOs

40:31.050 --> 40:32.550
and extraterrestrials.

40:36.850 --> 40:39.600
NARRATOR: Is there more going on
at Teotihuacan

40:39.600 --> 40:41.560
than archaeologists realize?

40:43.850 --> 40:47.070
Could there be secrets about
our extraterrestrial past

40:47.070 --> 40:51.570
left for us to discover
at this ancient city?

40:51.570 --> 40:53.700
HART:
At Teotihuacan,

40:53.700 --> 40:57.410
so far only ten percent
has been excavated.

40:57.410 --> 41:02.120
That means there's 90%
that remains to be dug up.

41:02.120 --> 41:05.540
How much more is there
at the site?

41:05.540 --> 41:07.420
We have no idea.

41:07.420 --> 41:11.050
But we have to ask,
if we continue and press on,

41:11.050 --> 41:14.680
might we find the artifacts,
the components

41:14.680 --> 41:16.890
that start to put
the pieces together,

41:16.890 --> 41:20.560
and perhaps lead us
to a much clearer concept

41:20.560 --> 41:24.060
of who these beings were
that built this?

41:24.060 --> 41:26.350
CHILDRESS: We don't know
what they will find

41:26.350 --> 41:28.060
in the future, but I suspect

41:28.060 --> 41:31.230
they'll make
some startling discoveries.

41:31.230 --> 41:35.280
There's many things in our past
that we just don't understand,

41:35.280 --> 41:38.990
but it's possible that
the answers, or some of them,

41:38.990 --> 41:40.370
are at Teotihuacan.

41:40.370 --> 41:42.750
NARRATOR:
Is it possible

41:42.750 --> 41:45.120
that the ancient complex
of Teotihuacan

41:45.120 --> 41:47.710
was an
extraterrestrial spaceport?

41:47.710 --> 41:50.920
Might it still hold
the very fuel

41:50.920 --> 41:54.970
that was used
to power alien craft?

41:54.970 --> 41:58.010
Perhaps the secrets
of Teotihuacan

41:58.010 --> 42:00.300
will ultimately be revealed

42:00.300 --> 42:06.430
in time for mankind's
alien ancestors to return.
