20:17.966 --> 20:19.384
before we're soup-acabra!

20:19.468 --> 20:20.708
- [narrator] <i>Nice.</i>
- Mr. Meaner,

20:20.844 --> 20:22.763
- you've gotta stand up to Chupacabra.
- But...

20:22.846 --> 20:26.183
No buts! If you don't, you're gonna live
in fear for the rest of your life.

20:26.558 --> 20:30.395
Hmm. You're right.
I'm tired of running from her.

20:30.479 --> 20:33.273
And not just because
I'm yeah, yeah, yeah, out of shape.

20:33.357 --> 20:35.234
[growls]

20:35.817 --> 20:38.987
Oh, no, Poopacabra!
That's only half the 'acabras we need!

20:39.071 --> 20:40.906
This wasn't our best plan.

20:40.989 --> 20:42.741
- [growls]
- [screaming]

20:44.117 --> 20:45.661
[snarling] Eh...?

20:45.744 --> 20:47.996
[growling]

20:48.080 --> 20:49.498
[all whining]

20:52.042 --> 20:53.919
That doesn't look like love.

20:54.002 --> 20:55.837
Why'd we listen to Hunt Catchmore?

20:55.921 --> 20:57.798
[growling continues]

21:03.262 --> 21:04.763
[growling stops]

21:07.641 --> 21:09.309
[gurgling]

21:11.311 --> 21:12.646
[sniffing]

21:23.156 --> 21:26.535
Yeah, I guess the thing that binds
all living creatures...

21:27.202 --> 21:28.120
is love.

21:28.203 --> 21:30.539
[narrator] <i>Which is exactly
what Mr. Meaner took away</i>

21:30.622 --> 21:34.042
<i>from Chupacabra
all those years ago in Mazatlán.</i>

21:34.209 --> 21:37.462
- Do you know what this means?
- They'll live happily ever after?

21:37.546 --> 21:39.798
No. I'm finally free!

21:39.881 --> 21:41.800
Whoo!

21:42.884 --> 21:44.928
[narrator] <i>So, George and Harold
got one more chance</i>

21:45.012 --> 21:46.930
<i>to present their Advancimal.</i>

21:47.014 --> 21:50.892
And so, we found true love for Ratrick.

21:50.976 --> 21:52.019
[clapping]

21:52.102 --> 21:56.356
Well, now that that's done, it's obvious
that Melvin's Advancimal is the winner.

21:56.440 --> 21:57.649
[students gasp]

21:57.858 --> 21:59.109
Behold, fools!

21:59.318 --> 22:02.487
Look upon my ribbon and despair!
Oh, what...?

22:02.571 --> 22:05.157
I cannot accept this award
in good conscience.

22:05.240 --> 22:06.158
[all gasp]

22:06.241 --> 22:08.493
Melvin gave me the gift
of human intellect,

22:08.577 --> 22:10.871
but George and Harold
have given their Advancimal

22:10.954 --> 22:13.123
a far greater gift... love!

22:13.206 --> 22:14.708
[purring]

22:14.791 --> 22:18.837
As victor, I cede my triumph
to its rightful recipient.

22:19.755 --> 22:21.131
[purring]

22:21.381 --> 22:23.425
I'll just leave this here.

22:24.801 --> 22:26.053
That means we passed, right?

22:26.470 --> 22:28.597
- [grunts] I guess.
- What?

22:29.431 --> 22:31.516
Yes! We're one step closer!

22:31.600 --> 22:32.642
Still in the game!

22:34.519 --> 22:36.855
- Huh? What?
- [slurps]

22:37.522 --> 22:39.876
I thought I could get used to this,
but I've changed my mind

22:39.900 --> 22:41.276
and I want to get out.
