00:02.160 --> 00:04.686
Previously on Arrow:

00:05.840 --> 00:07.842
I'm sorry. I should go.

00:09.840 --> 00:12.844
The night of the siege,
you were at the train station.

00:13.040 --> 00:16.328
I got attacked by one
of those crazy, masked things.

00:16.480 --> 00:18.767
But he got shot by a cop, I think.

00:18.960 --> 00:20.962
- It was Malcolm Merlyn.
- He's dead.

00:21.160 --> 00:23.766
- Thank you, Dad.
- I promised you, Thea.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.809
I will never let anyone hurt you.

00:26.040 --> 00:27.246
- Sara Lance is dead.
- Yes.

00:27.400 --> 00:29.528
- At Merlyn's hand?
- It appears.

00:29.680 --> 00:32.411
Al Sa-Her will face the League's justice.

00:32.560 --> 00:33.800
What of Queen?

00:34.000 --> 00:35.889
He has sworn to protect Merlyn.

00:36.040 --> 00:41.206
If that is true,
then Oliver Queen courts war with us.

00:59.640 --> 01:01.881
Hey. Very nice.

01:02.560 --> 01:04.608
Merry Christmas, captain.

01:11.080 --> 01:12.844
Merry Christmas.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.368
- Well, I feel bad. I didn't get you anything.
- You keep the city safe.

01:16.520 --> 01:18.363
So do you.

01:19.120 --> 01:22.886
You know, these days, you're the
closest thing to a partner I got.

01:23.840 --> 01:25.251
Happy Holidays.

01:25.480 --> 01:27.244
Here you go, buddy.

01:32.400 --> 01:33.447
Merlyn.

02:09.160 --> 02:10.810
Nyssa.

02:11.120 --> 02:12.690
What is this? We agreed...

02:12.880 --> 02:14.609
To nothing.

02:15.480 --> 02:19.883
My father decided to give you the time to bring
Sara's killer to justice, and you have failed.

02:20.080 --> 02:22.890
We're doing everything that we can.

02:23.120 --> 02:25.168
You've been distracted protecting the city.

02:25.320 --> 02:28.324
And you've exhausted my father's patience.

02:29.800 --> 02:32.883
In civilizations past,
when someone in the village was murdered...

02:33.040 --> 02:36.647
...the League would kill 50 people
a day until the criminal was rooted out.

02:36.840 --> 02:40.128
Find and deliver the one
who killed Ta-er al-Sahfer.

02:40.320 --> 02:42.482
You have 48 hours
or the citizens of Starling...

02:42.680 --> 02:45.160
...will see what the League of Assassins
is capable of.

02:45.320 --> 02:48.688
You're gonna slaughter innocent people?

02:48.920 --> 02:51.844
The cleansing of Starling City
will fall to Sarab.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.924
- Maseo.
- Maseo is no longer.

03:00.120 --> 03:02.805
As she said, I am Sarab.

03:02.960 --> 03:07.522
Deliver Sara's killer
or blood will flow in your streets.

03:07.720 --> 03:09.927
This isn't what Sara would want.

03:10.160 --> 03:12.447
Sara is dead.

03:12.720 --> 03:15.200
It's time you remember that.

03:24.760 --> 03:26.762
Dad's okay.

03:27.320 --> 03:28.367
Working too much.

03:29.200 --> 03:33.046
I'm sorry. I never really know
what to say when I come here. I just...

03:35.880 --> 03:38.724
I wanted to wish you Merry Christmas.

03:39.280 --> 03:42.204
And tell you how much I miss you.

03:42.400 --> 03:44.084
Laurel?

03:46.560 --> 03:48.562
Thea. What are you doing here?

03:48.720 --> 03:51.883
I was just leaving flowers for my mom.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.050
Who were you talking to?

03:54.240 --> 03:57.881
Nobody. I just come here sometimes.

03:58.080 --> 03:59.570
Even though Sara's still alive?

04:01.760 --> 04:05.082
Laurel, what's wrong?
Everything's fine. Sara's okay.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.525
No, Thea.

04:11.080 --> 04:12.411
Sara's dead.

04:14.120 --> 04:17.124
What? What are you talking about?

04:17.399 --> 04:19.322
While you were gone...

04:19.920 --> 04:21.445
...she was murdered.

04:24.560 --> 04:27.723
- By who?
- I don't know. I buried her here.

04:27.920 --> 04:31.891
Why didn't you tell anybody?
Like, at least your father? The police?

04:32.120 --> 04:36.444
- No. No. Thea, no one can ever know.
- Why?

04:36.600 --> 04:38.329
Just...

04:39.320 --> 04:41.448
Sara, she was, uh...

04:42.320 --> 04:43.606
She was complicated.

04:44.160 --> 04:48.688
And if my father found
out, it would kill him.

04:49.600 --> 04:53.047
You have to promise me
that you won't tell Oliver.

04:53.240 --> 04:55.686
Of course. I promise.

04:57.640 --> 04:59.085
I'm so sorry.

05:02.920 --> 05:05.526
Hey, did you know there's
a cafeteria in the building?

05:05.680 --> 05:08.331
There's a cold-pressed juice bar,
organic salad station.

05:08.480 --> 05:13.168
I know. I eat there every day
along with 800 of your other employees.

05:13.320 --> 05:16.802
- Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.
- Wait, Felicity.

05:17.000 --> 05:18.490
Are we okay?

05:18.680 --> 05:21.490
If by "we" you mean you and me
as individual entities...

05:21.640 --> 05:24.325
...then yes, we are fantastic.

05:25.160 --> 05:27.527
- This is about the kiss.
- This is not about the kiss.

05:27.720 --> 05:30.690
You sure? Because it really feels
like it's about the kiss.

05:30.880 --> 05:34.168
Unless it's about how I
left after the kiss.

05:34.320 --> 05:36.800
- I can explain.
- No. I can explain.

05:36.960 --> 05:39.167
It was a moment, and you regret it.
It's over.

05:39.320 --> 05:43.086
Now, can we pretend like it never happened
and go back to being professionals?

05:46.240 --> 05:49.403
I have to go. Work.

05:49.640 --> 05:52.689
But you're at work.

05:54.320 --> 05:56.891
- What happened?
- Nyssa paid me a visit.

05:57.160 --> 06:00.164
The League wants Sara's killer
handed over in the next 48 hours.

06:00.360 --> 06:03.682
Why do I sense there's an
"or else" at the end of that sentence?

06:03.920 --> 06:06.890
- Or else they'll start killing civilians.
- My God. Two days.

06:07.040 --> 06:09.884
Caitlin has DNA we pulled off
of the arrows that killed Sara.

06:10.040 --> 06:13.249
But the STR markers are degraded,
so it's taking a little bit longer.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.164
Felicity.

06:15.720 --> 06:17.722
It can't take any longer.

06:19.520 --> 06:22.842
If we can't find Sara's killer,
we're gonna need a contingency plan.

06:23.040 --> 06:24.929
I know.

06:26.200 --> 06:27.929
I don't have one.

06:41.720 --> 06:43.245
Here.

06:46.920 --> 06:48.922
I'm not hungry.

06:50.240 --> 06:55.565
The first time I interrogated someone,
I lost my appetite for two days.

06:55.720 --> 06:57.882
You need your strength.

06:58.400 --> 07:00.607
I didn't interrogate anyone.

07:00.760 --> 07:03.445
I tortured him.

07:04.600 --> 07:09.731
The question is, did you learn anything
about Chien Na Wei's plans?

07:09.920 --> 07:14.608
There's a biotech company in Hong Kong.
They were working on a super antibiotic.

07:14.800 --> 07:17.451
They got a super virus instead.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.887
They're calling it Omega.

07:20.080 --> 07:24.404
- Which is the Chinese translation for...
- Omega.

07:24.560 --> 07:27.245
They said one vial could wipe out
an entire city.

07:27.400 --> 07:31.962
So it's a bioweapon Chien Na Wei's after.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.448
Did he tell you where it is now?

07:34.640 --> 07:38.281
Yeah. He didn't want to, but I made him.

07:38.440 --> 07:41.250
You did what was necessary.

07:41.640 --> 07:46.521
One man's agony is not worth
the lives of an entire city.

07:49.640 --> 07:52.803
They all right? Okay.
Yes, it is coming through now.

07:52.960 --> 07:56.601
No, I'm fine. Things are just tense here.

07:56.800 --> 08:00.122
Thank you, Caitlin.
Happy Holidays to you too.

08:00.600 --> 08:01.806
Are those the DNA results?

08:02.000 --> 08:05.004
It's the genome S.T.A.R. Labs
was able to get off of the arrow.

08:05.160 --> 08:08.164
- I need to run it against suspects.
- What database are you using?

08:08.320 --> 08:10.448
S.C.P.D. maintains
a genetic markers database.

08:10.600 --> 08:13.126
Anyone who's committed a felony
in the past three years.

08:13.840 --> 08:16.684
- No, that... That can't be right.
- Who is it?

08:16.840 --> 08:20.162
- It must be a mistake.
- Felicity, who killed Sara?

08:22.000 --> 08:23.570
You did.

08:46.200 --> 08:48.009
This must be a mistake.

08:48.200 --> 08:50.885
I took perspiration off the arrows
that killed Sara.

08:51.080 --> 08:55.244
Two years ago when the police arrested Oliver
because they thought he was the vigilante...

08:55.400 --> 08:59.724
...they took a DNA sample. That sample
is a match for 12 out of the 13 STRs.

08:59.880 --> 09:02.406
The odds of that, they're impossible.

09:02.600 --> 09:05.922
- So somehow my DNA is on the arrows.
- Someone's setting you up, Oliver.

09:06.080 --> 09:09.721
Somebody with a vested interest in pitting
me against the League of Assassins.

09:09.880 --> 09:11.086
It's Malcolm Merlyn.

09:11.240 --> 09:14.084
Merlyn was in Corto Maltese
with Thea when this was going down.

09:14.320 --> 09:18.769
Unless he wasn't. Merlyn hid successfully for
two years from the police and the League.

09:18.920 --> 09:21.605
- He's good at covering his tracks.
- So we uncover them.

09:22.680 --> 09:24.569
But it might take some time.

09:24.760 --> 09:27.809
In less than 48 hours,
the League is gonna murder 5O people.

09:28.040 --> 09:29.530
We don't have time.

09:42.120 --> 09:45.249
Move to the lab.
I'll deal with the rest of security.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.129
Stay on comms.

09:47.800 --> 09:51.486
- Maseo, you set?
- Just about.

10:00.760 --> 10:02.967
- I found Omega.
- Be careful with it.

10:04.760 --> 10:08.003
- We might have a problem.
- What's wrong?

10:08.400 --> 10:13.008
Somebody already took it.
How did she get in here before us?

10:18.400 --> 10:20.687
She didn't need to get in, Oliver.

10:21.440 --> 10:23.966
She already had someone inside.

10:25.400 --> 10:27.004
Yeah, I know. But it's a holiday.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.845
So I guess I'm feeling charitable.
Is that okay?

10:30.000 --> 10:32.526
Jake, I gotta call you right back.

10:33.160 --> 10:34.764
- Hey.
- Hi.

10:36.120 --> 10:37.929
Look who it is.

10:38.680 --> 10:42.401
- How was your ride down?
- Oh, uneventful. Chance to grade some papers.

10:42.600 --> 10:47.401
Dad, maybe you can tell me why half your
officers are allergic to search warrants.

10:48.160 --> 10:50.049
- Mom.
- Hi, sweetheart.

10:50.200 --> 10:53.443
- I didn't know that you were coming to town.
- I guess that's my fault.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.648
I thought you could do
a Christmas surprise.

10:57.920 --> 11:01.367
Of course I wanna spend Christmas
with my family. So where's Sara?

11:01.520 --> 11:03.727
She's not returning my phone calls.

11:03.920 --> 11:05.843
Yeah, that's because she's traveling.

11:06.440 --> 11:10.047
Backpacking through the Andes.

11:10.840 --> 11:12.842
- I think.
- Yeah.

11:15.000 --> 11:19.369
I found something. A.R.G.U.S. monitors air
traffic in and out of countries of interest.

11:19.520 --> 11:23.491
- Corto Maltese is on that list.
- This is a list of every commercial airliner...

11:23.640 --> 11:28.089
...private jet, sea plane, hot air balloon that
took off from Corto Maltese this past year.

11:28.240 --> 11:32.245
Look at this flight path. Private
charter from Corto Maltese to Caracas.

11:32.440 --> 11:35.569
Then to Cartagena only to fly back
to Caracas and then to Tijuana.

11:35.720 --> 11:39.088
Whoever was on that plane was working hard
to hide where he was going.

11:39.240 --> 11:42.562
The route ends at a private landing strip
just outside Starling City.

11:42.760 --> 11:43.841
When did it land?

11:44.680 --> 11:46.250
The night before Sara was murdered.

11:51.080 --> 11:53.606
- Please. All I do is fly the plane.
- Quiet.

11:53.760 --> 11:58.527
The man in this photo, did you fly him
from Corto Maltese to Starling City?

11:58.680 --> 12:00.091
No.

12:02.240 --> 12:05.005
This time look at the photo.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.890
- He'll kill me.
- He's not here.

12:09.120 --> 12:12.488
- We are.
- All right. Okay. Yes, I flew him here.

12:12.880 --> 12:15.406
I've got security footage. You wanna see?

12:15.560 --> 12:16.607
Hanukkah present?

12:16.760 --> 12:19.604
Security footage from the airfield
where Merlyn landed.

12:20.080 --> 12:21.684
Check for October 7th.

12:25.280 --> 12:26.281
Right there. Stop.

12:53.720 --> 12:57.566
You said Merlyn was keeping his distance
from Thea. That he hadn't had any contact.

12:57.720 --> 12:59.245
He lied.

12:59.720 --> 13:01.245
And so did she.

13:01.400 --> 13:04.244
There's something we should consider.
Maybe it wasn't your DNA.

13:04.400 --> 13:06.004
- Maybe it was Thea's.
- What?

13:06.160 --> 13:09.289
You two are siblings.
There would be overlap. Maybe enough to...

13:09.520 --> 13:11.682
Diggle, are you listening to yourself?

13:11.920 --> 13:17.927
You're suggesting that Thea killed Sara.
Even if she would... Even if she could...

13:18.080 --> 13:19.081
...why?

13:19.240 --> 13:20.924
Malcolm Merlyn is her father.

13:22.640 --> 13:25.371
- I hate to even say this.
- Then don't.

13:25.600 --> 13:27.090
Oliver.

13:27.320 --> 13:30.961
I know how much you love your sister,
but we have to look at the facts.

13:31.360 --> 13:34.330
The autopsy I did on Sara,
I thought Roy might have stabbed her.

13:34.560 --> 13:38.007
Because the trajectory wasn't consistent
with an archer of average height.

13:38.200 --> 13:42.330
- You weren't considering a killer Thea's size.
- Enough. Both of you.

13:42.560 --> 13:46.451
My sister did not kill Sara.
The DNA on the arrows is mine...

13:46.640 --> 13:49.291
...because Malcolm Merlyn put it there.

13:54.960 --> 13:58.487
- Hi.
- Hey, we need to talk, so I came here.

13:58.680 --> 14:01.490
- Here where?
- Where you are.

14:01.640 --> 14:04.883
I might have pinged your phone again.

14:05.120 --> 14:09.091
I thought I was pretty clear
when I said I didn't wanna talk about this.

14:09.320 --> 14:12.642
You were. But you were also pretty wrong...

14:13.600 --> 14:15.523
...when you said I regretted kissing you.

14:16.640 --> 14:21.123
I can't imagine there's a man on the planet
who would ever regret kissing you.

14:21.640 --> 14:26.521
- I can think of one.
- But I am sorry about the way I reacted.

14:29.320 --> 14:33.689
- When I kissed you, I felt guilty.
- Oh, my God. You're cheating on someone.

14:33.840 --> 14:35.251
No.

14:37.680 --> 14:39.682
Her name is Anna.

14:40.160 --> 14:41.321
And we were engaged.

14:41.840 --> 14:47.768
Last spring, the night those men
took over the city, we ran into a few.

14:47.920 --> 14:49.684
We tried to escape, but we couldn't.

14:50.360 --> 14:54.684
I tried to fight them, but I couldn't.
I wasn't strong enough.

14:56.560 --> 15:03.170
They broke my leg and went after her,
but I couldn't save her.

15:03.360 --> 15:05.362
And I watched them...

15:07.200 --> 15:09.202
...as they broke her neck.

15:09.880 --> 15:11.291
Ray, I am so sorry.

15:11.520 --> 15:14.046
Anna was supposed to be
the last woman I ever kissed.

15:14.720 --> 15:18.884
And she was.
Until suddenly, I was kissing you.

15:36.560 --> 15:39.404
Hey. What are you doing home?

15:39.560 --> 15:41.801
I wanted the Christmas
tree to be a surprise.

15:42.080 --> 15:43.684
It's a surprise.

15:43.920 --> 15:46.241
Thought since it's just
the two of us now...

15:46.400 --> 15:49.404
...the smaller the family, bigger the tree.

15:49.600 --> 15:50.806
What about Malcolm?

15:51.560 --> 15:54.928
Thea, I know you saw him in Corto Maltese.

15:55.080 --> 15:58.209
Ollie, we've lost everyone.

15:58.400 --> 16:02.121
Malcolm's the only family
I have left besides you.

16:02.320 --> 16:06.370
Thea, I deserve to know
what you were doing with Malcolm Merlyn.

16:06.600 --> 16:08.364
I've just been getting to know him.

16:08.600 --> 16:11.285
Did you fly back to Starling City with him?

16:11.440 --> 16:12.771
No.

16:12.920 --> 16:16.367
Ollie, if I was back in Starling,
don't you think I would have called you?

16:16.600 --> 16:19.126
I was in Corto Maltese since May.

16:19.280 --> 16:25.447
Now, will you please just come upstairs
and help me find some more Christmas stuff?

16:45.840 --> 16:48.844
- What's he saying?
- He's trying to bribe us.

16:52.440 --> 16:54.363
We want the vial of Omega you stole.

16:54.560 --> 16:57.484
I don't know
what you're talking about. I didn't steal.

16:57.680 --> 17:01.685
Don't waste your energy on lies.
We will get the truth from you.

17:02.400 --> 17:04.800
One way or the other.

17:05.040 --> 17:08.203
My friend can be very persuasive.

17:14.640 --> 17:17.483
So how are you?

17:18.680 --> 17:22.480
I'm great. Work's great.
I've just been really busy.

17:22.680 --> 17:26.685
- Something's happened.
- What? No. No. Nothing's happened.

17:27.839 --> 17:30.684
It's Sara, isn't it?

17:31.360 --> 17:36.730
When I mentioned her earlier,
you seemed so broken.

17:36.920 --> 17:40.003
Mom, Sara's fine.

17:40.200 --> 17:41.440
She's just being Sara.

17:42.320 --> 17:45.847
There are few things as powerful
as a mother's intuition.

17:46.080 --> 17:49.801
You're hiding something. I know it.

17:50.040 --> 17:54.090
Just like I was the only one who knew
that Sara didn't die on that boat.

17:54.320 --> 17:57.529
I had this feeling that
I would see her again.

17:57.720 --> 18:00.200
And right now...

18:00.760 --> 18:04.845
...that feeling is gone.

18:09.040 --> 18:12.362
She's dead, isn't she?

18:14.560 --> 18:16.449
Mom, listen to me.

18:16.640 --> 18:19.883
Sara, she was involved
with some very, very dangerous people.

18:20.040 --> 18:24.090
This has to remain a secret. At least until
we figure out exactly what happened.

18:24.240 --> 18:27.005
I don't understand.
Doesn't your father know?

18:27.240 --> 18:29.447
If he knew about Sara...

18:31.480 --> 18:33.448
...he couldn't take it.

18:35.880 --> 18:39.009
And I can't lose anyone else.

19:35.480 --> 19:37.050
Father.

19:40.720 --> 19:44.202
- It's nearly time.
- Mr. Queen has not yet presented the guilty?

19:45.640 --> 19:48.689
Perhaps he believes our threats are empty.

19:50.200 --> 19:51.850
We must correct that belief.

19:52.960 --> 19:56.851
Return to Starling City. Be merciless.

19:57.840 --> 20:01.162
Teach Oliver Queen we only ask but once.

20:02.640 --> 20:04.324
Where you been?

20:04.480 --> 20:06.084
I went to see Thea.

20:06.320 --> 20:09.961
She lied to me again,
but she didn't kill Sara.

20:10.160 --> 20:12.162
- Oliver.
- I looked her in the eyes, Felicity.

20:12.320 --> 20:14.846
These are eyes
that I have known my entire life.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.368
She could lie to me about Merlyn
and spending time with him.

20:18.520 --> 20:20.522
But she could never do this.

20:20.680 --> 20:23.411
Oliver, you are one
of the smartest men I've known.

20:23.600 --> 20:26.206
But you have a blind spot
when it comes to your family.

20:26.360 --> 20:28.203
- Not this time.
- Your mother and father.

20:28.360 --> 20:30.362
- That's enough.
- Now Thea. She lied to you.

20:30.520 --> 20:32.488
Both of you, stop.

20:34.000 --> 20:39.291
Oliver, I can't imagine how difficult
this must be for you, but John is right.

20:39.480 --> 20:43.371
- Thea lied.
- She lied about Merlyn, but Sara...

20:45.360 --> 20:47.886
I don't wanna believe
she could do something like this.

20:48.040 --> 20:52.887
Which is why you shouldn't
be the one asking the questions.

21:13.160 --> 21:16.926
Thea Queen, where is Malcolm Merlyn?

21:17.080 --> 21:19.924
I don't know. Please. Please don't hurt me.

21:27.080 --> 21:29.287
Stay away from me and my father.

21:51.440 --> 21:53.647
It's the strangest thing.

21:55.360 --> 21:58.842
Thea just called
and said she was attacked by the Arrow.

22:00.280 --> 22:03.602
You wouldn't happen to know anything
about that, now, would you, Oliver?

22:03.840 --> 22:04.887
This was you.

22:06.800 --> 22:12.443
You know, I figured when I spared the man
who murdered my mother...

22:12.800 --> 22:14.609
...I would never kill again.

22:17.640 --> 22:18.721
I was wrong.

22:20.080 --> 22:21.889
- You might wanna reconsider.
- Why?

22:22.080 --> 22:23.161
For Thea.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.490
Check your phone. I can wait.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.162
I don't think you'd want the League
to see that.

22:46.320 --> 22:49.005
And if you kill me, they will.

22:49.640 --> 22:52.689
- This isn't her.
- You've heard of a plant called Votura?

22:54.400 --> 22:57.882
It grows in South America.
In fact, it thrives in Corto Maltese.

22:58.120 --> 23:01.442
Making its subject extremely susceptible
to suggestion...

23:01.680 --> 23:04.445
...while retaining no memory
of their actions.

23:04.680 --> 23:08.730
I will tell Ra's this was you.
That Thea was under your control.

23:08.920 --> 23:11.526
And he will still kill her.
She fired the arrows.

23:11.680 --> 23:14.570
- You've given her a death sentence.
- No.

23:15.360 --> 23:19.649
- What I've done is given you incentive.
- To do what?

23:19.840 --> 23:23.208
To tell Ra's that you killed Sara Lance.

23:23.400 --> 23:27.689
By rite, you will be given a trial
by combat with Ra's.

23:27.920 --> 23:32.721
His death will erase any blood debt
from his reign...

23:32.880 --> 23:36.043
...including Thea's.
And yours.

23:39.040 --> 23:40.087
I have to be honest.

23:40.240 --> 23:43.961
I was a mite concerned that the killing
would have been a deal breaker for you.

23:45.040 --> 23:51.924
But I'm gratified to see that Thea
is still sufficient motivation.

23:52.720 --> 23:57.487
Don't take too long making up your mind.
Ra's isn't known for his patience.

23:58.560 --> 24:03.088
Thea was always so kind.
The kindest person I've ever known.

24:04.680 --> 24:06.603
My sister wasn't born a killer.

24:06.760 --> 24:10.560
Malcolm Merlyn made her one,
and I let it happen.

24:10.760 --> 24:12.410
No, you didn't.

24:13.080 --> 24:15.811
When it comes to family,
you always place blame on yourself.

24:15.960 --> 24:18.770
- This is not your fault.
- She's right, Oliver.

24:18.920 --> 24:21.764
Throw Malcolm in front of Ra's.
Let the League sort this out.

24:21.920 --> 24:23.490
Merlyn has a video.

24:24.520 --> 24:28.923
- He made contingencies.
- Oliver, if you fight Ra's al Ghul, he'll kill you.

24:29.080 --> 24:30.844
No, he won't.

24:31.760 --> 24:34.969
During the undertaking,
Merlyn told me that I couldn't win...

24:35.240 --> 24:38.005
...because I didn't know
what I was fighting for.

24:38.280 --> 24:40.169
Now I do.

24:41.600 --> 24:43.967
I'm fighting for Thea.

24:48.760 --> 24:50.888
He should've confessed by now.

24:51.120 --> 24:55.250
- We have video of him taking the vial.
- He says he doesn't remember.

24:55.440 --> 24:58.649
He's lying. You don't do something
like that and not remember it.

24:58.800 --> 25:02.122
There is a way.
I didn't think it a possibility until now.

25:03.120 --> 25:05.851
There's a drug. It's called Votura.

25:06.040 --> 25:09.886
I've heard it makes people
extremely susceptible to suggestion.

25:10.120 --> 25:12.282
Like mind control?

25:12.960 --> 25:14.849
Really? That's a thing?

25:15.040 --> 25:18.761
Those that get dosed have no memory
of what they do while under the influence.

25:18.960 --> 25:21.486
Oh, great. All this was for nothing.

25:21.640 --> 25:25.804
Chien Na Wei has the vial
and we have no way of finding her.

25:26.040 --> 25:28.407
We've taken her inside man.

25:28.640 --> 25:31.564
Finding her may not be
the problem at hand.

25:31.840 --> 25:33.888
The problem could be her finding us.

25:41.800 --> 25:45.202
Good evening, Mrs. Yamashiro.
ls your husband home?

25:51.880 --> 25:53.370
Don't you dare talk to my son.

25:54.520 --> 25:57.888
Quaint house for a spy.

25:58.360 --> 26:02.331
Except for these.
They belong to you, don't they?

26:02.520 --> 26:04.124
Tatsu, isn't it?

26:07.840 --> 26:08.841
Beautiful blade.

26:33.360 --> 26:34.361
Where is he?

26:34.520 --> 26:37.683
You really think my father,
the Demon's Head...

26:37.840 --> 26:41.208
...would travel all the way from Nanda
Parbat simply because you wish it?

26:41.720 --> 26:42.767
Yes.

26:44.840 --> 26:46.649
This way.

26:54.160 --> 26:55.969
Kneel before the Demon's Head.

27:10.280 --> 27:12.487
You're just a boy.

27:15.640 --> 27:17.404
Mr. Queen.

27:18.320 --> 27:22.291
You failed to protect the city you love.
Now you'll watch it bleed.

27:22.480 --> 27:25.768
Nobody in my city will die tonight.

27:25.920 --> 27:30.482
Well, there was only one way
to prevent that.

27:30.640 --> 27:34.770
You were to produce for me
the one who killed Ta-er al-Sahfer.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.321
And yet you've come alone.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.525
Because it was me.

27:43.840 --> 27:46.002
- I killed Sara.
- Why would you kill a woman...

27:46.160 --> 27:49.323
...you once professed to love?
Because she begged me to.

27:49.560 --> 27:51.164
You lie.

27:55.360 --> 27:59.410
It wasn't the first time Sara chose death
over a life in the League.

27:59.560 --> 28:03.201
And meeting you now, I can see why.

28:05.560 --> 28:08.530
I should have Sarab cleave your head
from your shoulders.

28:09.160 --> 28:11.970
Not for killing my daughter's beloved...

28:12.160 --> 28:13.969
...but for thinking me a fool.

28:14.160 --> 28:18.529
By League law, I have a right to
challenge you to a trial by combat.

28:23.040 --> 28:26.089
It's been 67 years
since someone challenged me.

28:27.480 --> 28:30.051
You covet death that much?

28:30.240 --> 28:31.571
Do you accept?

28:33.080 --> 28:34.889
Oh, yes.

28:54.800 --> 28:57.644
I see the years have done little
to dull your stubbornness.

28:57.920 --> 28:59.922
- Maseo.
- My name is Sarab.

29:00.120 --> 29:03.841
- You told me a man cannot live by two names.
- And I don't.

29:04.080 --> 29:06.242
Maseo is dead.

29:06.440 --> 29:10.604
I am all that's left. Sarab. A phantom.

29:11.160 --> 29:13.083
After...

29:13.600 --> 29:17.685
...it happened, you went to Nanda Parbat.

29:18.440 --> 29:23.571
I arrived the same year as Ta-er al-Sahfer.
She was a great warrior.

29:24.680 --> 29:25.920
You did not kill her.

29:28.320 --> 29:33.121
When you face the Demon,
it will be my duty to bear witness.

29:33.320 --> 29:35.322
I have no desire to watch you die.

29:36.200 --> 29:39.966
Under our code,
you have 12 hours to settle your affairs.

29:40.160 --> 29:42.845
The 13th hour, be at this place.

29:44.960 --> 29:47.167
This is consecrated ground for the League.

29:47.320 --> 29:51.882
A place for the settlement of blood debts
if one survives the climb.

29:52.840 --> 29:53.887
If you do.

29:55.800 --> 29:57.723
See you on the mountain.

30:00.640 --> 30:05.123
Do you remember how when the two of you
were little you played dress up?

30:06.120 --> 30:08.248
One day I overheard you and Sara.

30:10.080 --> 30:13.482
You were pretending
to be grown up versions of yourselves.

30:14.880 --> 30:20.171
That day, you and your sister,
you had your own families.

30:20.720 --> 30:22.210
Careers.

30:22.360 --> 30:25.682
I was a cop, just like Dad. And Sara...

30:25.920 --> 30:28.002
Was a doctor.

30:28.480 --> 30:31.051
She wanted to heal people.

30:34.200 --> 30:36.726
She deserves more than this.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.411
Mom, can I tell you something?

30:44.000 --> 30:49.131
Whoever did this to Sara, I'm gonna
find them, no matter what it takes.

30:49.360 --> 30:51.010
And I am gonna make them pay.

30:55.400 --> 30:58.244
Then you make them pay.

30:58.960 --> 31:02.169
And you make them suffer.

31:08.440 --> 31:10.283
Looks good.

31:11.880 --> 31:13.450
- Thank you.
- Good night.

31:14.520 --> 31:17.126
- What happened to the window?
- Oh. You should have seen it.

31:17.280 --> 31:19.647
This bird went completely Hitchcock
on the thing.

31:19.800 --> 31:22.883
I vacuumed up most of the glass,
but I'd still watch your step.

31:23.040 --> 31:24.769
I'll be extra careful.

31:26.560 --> 31:28.403
Are you okay?

31:28.960 --> 31:33.488
Last time you had that look on your face,
you told me Dad committed suicide.

31:33.760 --> 31:36.604
You haven't called him dad
since you found out about Malcolm.

31:38.760 --> 31:40.410
What's going on with you, Ollie?

31:40.600 --> 31:43.001
You think you know
who Malcolm Merlyn is...

31:43.240 --> 31:48.929
...but there are things that I've
discovered years ago, recently...

31:49.840 --> 31:52.571
...that he doesn't love you, Thea.

31:53.440 --> 31:55.283
Because he's not capable of it.

31:55.480 --> 31:57.642
Ollie, please.

31:57.840 --> 31:59.604
Don't.

32:00.320 --> 32:04.609
Don't make me choose
between my father and my brother.

32:06.080 --> 32:07.923
I would never make you choose.

32:08.920 --> 32:10.922
You are my family.

32:11.520 --> 32:14.285
There's nothing that I won't do
to protect you.

32:14.520 --> 32:16.761
What does that mean?

32:22.000 --> 32:25.971
It means I love you, no matter what.

32:33.600 --> 32:34.886
Tatsu!

32:35.280 --> 32:37.647
- Akio.
- What happened here?

32:37.800 --> 32:41.521
Oh, God, no. No. No. No.

32:41.760 --> 32:44.366
- Akio, no.
- Daddy.

32:44.640 --> 32:48.281
Akio. Akio. Where is your mother?

32:48.480 --> 32:51.051
The white-haired woman, she took her.

32:56.880 --> 33:00.089
Guess who just
designed a microprocessor...

33:00.320 --> 33:03.369
...with a SPECint score just north of 9000?
Ray.

33:03.560 --> 33:07.167
What are you doing with Queen Consolidated?
Why did you buy it?

33:07.320 --> 33:08.924
Because it was for sale.

33:09.560 --> 33:11.927
My life is a little more complicated
than I led on.

33:12.080 --> 33:14.924
Suffice it to say, I have gotten
very good at keeping secrets.

33:15.080 --> 33:18.004
Particularly, the kind of secret
someone like you keeps.

33:19.480 --> 33:21.164
Someone in pain.

33:21.320 --> 33:24.244
- It wasn't easy to tell you about Anna.
- You told me about Anna.

33:24.400 --> 33:27.324
But you didn't tell me the truth
about what it is you're doing.

33:27.520 --> 33:30.205
- So tell me or I walk.
- I can't tell you.

33:33.160 --> 33:35.162
I have to show you.

33:39.120 --> 33:40.531
The dawn of the computer age.

33:40.680 --> 33:43.889
Developers thought the only way
a machine could process information...

33:44.080 --> 33:47.368
...as fast as a human brain
was to build a mainframe the size of Texas.

33:47.520 --> 33:51.241
But one developer realized the only way
to reduce heat and power consumption...

33:51.400 --> 33:54.051
...was to bring the components
closer together.

33:54.200 --> 33:56.123
Which meant making them smaller.

33:56.320 --> 33:58.527
But why stop at computers?

33:58.720 --> 34:00.245
What if I could take other things?

34:00.400 --> 34:04.928
Like, say, all of the military grade technology
in Applied Sciences and make it smaller too.

34:06.760 --> 34:09.411
So small that it could fit
in the palm of my hand.

34:09.880 --> 34:12.724
- I could help a lot of people that way.
- I don't understand.

34:12.880 --> 34:14.563
This will help.

34:19.480 --> 34:20.844
Whoa.

34:21.760 --> 34:23.728
- What is it?
- O.M.A.C.

34:23.880 --> 34:25.723
Was the Queen Consolidated designation.

34:25.880 --> 34:29.646
But I'm kind of partial to A-T-O-M.

34:29.840 --> 34:31.728
Advanced Technology
Operating Mechanism.

34:32.560 --> 34:35.005
- ATOM.
- What are you gonna use it for?

34:35.239 --> 34:39.928
To protect the people of this city.
And I want you to help.

34:41.920 --> 34:44.889
Why does this keep happening to me?

34:46.760 --> 34:49.603
- Oliver.
- John, I have to do this.

34:49.760 --> 34:52.684
I know. I'd just rather die
than let you go it alone.

34:53.480 --> 34:55.244
Not this time.

34:57.960 --> 35:00.201
- Take care of Thea.
- Absolutely.

35:02.960 --> 35:06.123
I'm sorry. Something came up.

35:07.920 --> 35:09.331
Oh.

35:12.280 --> 35:13.770
Let's give them a minute.

35:18.040 --> 35:20.247
- So you're going.
- Mm-hm.

35:20.480 --> 35:25.441
- To Nanda Parbat?
- No, it's a neutral site. It'll be fine.

35:25.640 --> 35:29.486
I'll come back. Thea will be okay.

35:29.640 --> 35:31.961
I wish that sounded more convincing.

35:33.280 --> 35:36.727
I wish you wouldn't go, but I know you
so I'm not gonna ask you to stay.

35:36.960 --> 35:38.803
I appreciate that.

35:39.640 --> 35:43.850
But there is one thing
I need to ask you to do.

35:44.520 --> 35:46.204
And you're not going to want to.

35:46.440 --> 35:49.330
Well, if it's you asking, I'll do it.

35:50.200 --> 35:51.247
Kill him.

35:53.320 --> 35:55.004
You have to kill Ra's al Ghul.

35:55.160 --> 35:57.003
This is a duel...

35:57.440 --> 36:00.364
...with one of the most dangerous men
that has walked the Earth.

36:00.520 --> 36:02.887
Wouldn't be doing it
if I didn't think I could win.

36:03.040 --> 36:05.691
I don't doubt that.
I don't doubt you can beat him.

36:05.840 --> 36:09.049
I am terrified that you won't kill him.

36:09.840 --> 36:11.683
Because that's not who you are anymore.

36:11.840 --> 36:16.687
And I am so afraid that Ra's al Ghul
is gonna use your humanity against you.

36:18.880 --> 36:21.770
Felicity, I honestly don't know
if I'm a killer anymore.

36:22.000 --> 36:23.843
But I do know two things.

36:24.280 --> 36:29.047
The first is that whoever I am...

36:29.760 --> 36:31.888
...I'm someone that will do whatever...

36:32.120 --> 36:37.081
Whatever it takes to save my sister.

36:51.560 --> 36:53.085
And the second thing?

36:56.760 --> 36:58.524
I love you.

37:27.560 --> 37:29.688
Remove your shirts.

37:30.840 --> 37:32.763
This is custom.

37:33.760 --> 37:37.048
Ra's al Ghul is not known to be merciful.

37:37.240 --> 37:41.928
But if there was a chance,
this would be your final moment for it.

37:45.160 --> 37:47.083
Choose your weapon.

37:57.280 --> 38:00.966
I was 11 years old
when I killed my first man.

38:04.120 --> 38:10.127
And I remember the look on his face
when the light went out behind his eyes.

38:10.640 --> 38:13.007
Such a sudden change.

38:13.640 --> 38:15.130
Almost imperceptible...

38:15.640 --> 38:18.166
...between life and death.

38:18.360 --> 38:19.805
And I'd felt ashamed.

38:19.960 --> 38:25.000
I'd stolen from that man
the most precious gift of all. Life.

38:26.600 --> 38:28.682
But I also felt something else.

38:29.480 --> 38:31.369
Pride.

38:31.520 --> 38:35.844
Because I had taken up arms against someone
who sought to do ill against my family.

38:37.040 --> 38:40.726
And I realized what
I had done was necessary.

38:41.160 --> 38:42.650
You see.

38:42.920 --> 38:47.005
I had replaced evil with death.

38:48.720 --> 38:53.760
And that is what the League exists to do.

38:53.920 --> 38:56.764
And I have killed several
thousand more men since then.

38:58.840 --> 39:02.925
- And the world is better off for it.
- You've taken your last life.

39:03.120 --> 39:04.929
No.

39:05.120 --> 39:06.645
You have lived your last day.

39:07.720 --> 39:09.563
We are ready.

39:12.440 --> 39:16.570
I am envious of you.
You'll see her before I do.

39:20.080 --> 39:22.048
Fight me, boy.

39:24.960 --> 39:26.041
You're unarmed.

39:26.200 --> 39:29.044
I'll take your blades from you
once you are through with them.

40:28.920 --> 40:30.445
You should take pride.

40:32.440 --> 40:34.602
You survived longer than most.

40:51.480 --> 40:53.369
Don't be afraid, my son.

40:55.960 --> 41:00.045
Death comes for us all.
We can only evade it so long.

41:01.760 --> 41:04.889
Consider this an honorable exit.
