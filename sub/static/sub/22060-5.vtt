WEBVTT

00:06.322 --> 00:08.375
The rioting spread
to another cell block.

00:08.475 --> 00:10.379
That makes three on two tiers.

00:10.943 --> 00:12.539
She wants to hold
a press conference.

00:12.540 --> 00:13.939
ESU on the scene?

00:13.941 --> 00:15.641
On but not in,
pending our "go."

00:15.643 --> 00:16.270
SRG.

00:16.294 --> 00:19.229
Strategic Response Group means
you have a strategy, usually.

00:19.280 --> 00:20.279
That's her contribution?

00:20.281 --> 00:22.281
- I hear sarcasm.
- No.

00:22.283 --> 00:24.984
Carlton, tell her that'd be like
fiddling while Rome burns.

00:24.986 --> 00:28.053
I want to know the one thing
I don't get in this.

00:28.055 --> 00:30.022
Can you guess
what that thing is?

00:30.024 --> 00:32.658
Why are the inmates acting out

00:32.659 --> 00:36.729
when taking away solitary
is supposedly a win for them?

00:36.731 --> 00:37.731
Half right.

00:38.315 --> 00:39.652
What's the other half?

00:39.900 --> 00:42.067
Are we sure it's the inmates?

00:42.069 --> 00:45.037
Or are the corrections officers
acting out in protest?

00:45.039 --> 00:47.873
They put on a uniform
every day just like cops.

00:47.875 --> 00:50.442
And maybe when a mayor takes
a tool out of their belt,

00:50.444 --> 00:52.945
they act out, just like cops.

00:52.947 --> 00:54.847
I got nothing
that says it's the COs.

00:54.849 --> 00:57.016
You got nothing from who? COs?

00:57.018 --> 00:58.984
Yeah, the COs, like my
brother-in-law Lenny,

00:58.986 --> 01:01.653
been on that job for 14 years
and he's a good man.

01:01.655 --> 01:02.855
Carlton, you can...

01:02.857 --> 01:05.858
Sid, this is a policy beef,
not a family one.

01:05.860 --> 01:09.228
All due respect, cops and COs
are part of the same family.

01:09.230 --> 01:10.462
But tell her to expect his call

01:10.464 --> 01:12.631
and don't try to duck it,
<i>comprende?</i>

01:14.100 --> 01:16.668
The mayor says
it's an experiment

01:16.670 --> 01:19.071
and many experiments have
unstable launches...

01:19.073 --> 01:21.507
Of all the ignorant, egghead,
bleeding-heart...

01:21.509 --> 01:22.474
Just the messenger.

01:22.476 --> 01:24.443
If an experiment
blows up the lab,

01:24.445 --> 01:26.145
you shut down the experiment.

01:26.147 --> 01:27.813
She's gonna have to hear that
from you.

01:27.815 --> 01:30.582
Send in ESU.
Got it, boss.

01:30.584 --> 01:33.084
And she sure as hell
will hear it from me.

01:33.108 --> 01:34.120
You and me.

01:34.121 --> 01:35.921
No.

01:35.923 --> 01:38.724
Me and Sid. Set it up.

01:39.893 --> 01:43.128
Set it up, please.

01:45.000 --> 01:51.074

01:52.839 --> 01:54.406
Hey, what do we got?

01:54.408 --> 01:57.910
Jessica Rossi, 40s, looks like
she was cut from ear to ear.

01:57.912 --> 01:59.878
No weapon found.

01:59.880 --> 02:02.114
Discovered lying here
on the kitchen floor

02:02.116 --> 02:04.516
by her oldest son, Nick.

02:04.518 --> 02:06.151
She's got three kids in all,

02:06.153 --> 02:07.786
two boys, one girl.

02:07.788 --> 02:11.256
Where are they?
Over here.

02:21.634 --> 02:25.737
Nick, Detective Reagan,
my partner Detective Baez.

02:25.739 --> 02:27.039
We're very sorry
for your loss.

02:27.041 --> 02:28.073
Thank you.

02:28.075 --> 02:30.409
Do you mind if we ask you
a few questions?

02:30.411 --> 02:33.512
Steve, take Nicole
into the dining room.

02:33.514 --> 02:34.580
Wait for Grandma and Grandpa.

02:34.582 --> 02:36.248
Okay?

02:38.852 --> 02:42.020
We were told that you were the
person that found your mom.

02:42.022 --> 02:45.324
Could you take us through
what happened? Step by step.

02:45.326 --> 02:48.627
I, uh, came in through the
front door like I always do,

02:48.629 --> 02:51.063
and I called out for her.

02:51.065 --> 02:52.297
She was home a lot,

02:52.299 --> 02:53.799
but she'd be out sometimes,

02:53.801 --> 02:58.270
so I didn't think much of it
when she didn't respond.

02:58.272 --> 03:01.106
Nick, if you're not up for this,
we can do it another time.

03:01.108 --> 03:02.474
No. I can do it. I want to help.

03:02.476 --> 03:04.343
Okay. You said
she didn't respond.

03:04.345 --> 03:05.644
What happened next?

03:05.646 --> 03:09.114
I went into the kitchen
to make some food, and...

03:09.116 --> 03:11.717
it didn't even look like her.

03:11.719 --> 03:14.586
There was blood everywhere.

03:14.588 --> 03:15.921
We're so sorry.

03:15.923 --> 03:16.855
Now I wish I had.

03:16.857 --> 03:18.290
Should have at least
tried to help.

03:18.292 --> 03:19.558
There's nothing you
could have done, Nick.

03:19.560 --> 03:20.792
It was too late.

03:20.794 --> 03:23.128
Or given her a kiss,
said good-bye.

03:23.130 --> 03:24.630
What about your father?

03:24.632 --> 03:26.598
Is he, uh, on his way home?

03:26.600 --> 03:30.068
No. He moved out a year ago.

03:30.070 --> 03:33.138
Haven't heard from him since.

03:33.140 --> 03:35.707
Will you be staying
with your grandparents?

03:35.709 --> 03:37.109
I guess.

03:37.111 --> 03:39.211
- Definitely not my dad.
- Okay.

03:39.213 --> 03:40.879
Is there anything else
that you could think of

03:40.881 --> 03:42.014
that might be helpful to us?

03:42.016 --> 03:45.851
Well, I was thinking, um...

03:45.853 --> 03:48.220
Go ahead, Nick,
you can tell us.

03:49.689 --> 03:53.325
Is that how I'm always
gonna remember her?

03:55.962 --> 03:58.430
No.

03:58.432 --> 04:00.632
But it is gonna take some time.

04:04.705 --> 04:07.005
What's the holdup?

04:07.007 --> 04:09.107
People have places to be!

04:23.590 --> 04:25.791
Let's see who
ran out of gas

04:25.793 --> 04:27.092
in the middle of the
intersection today.

04:27.094 --> 04:29.528
All right, okay.
All right, we got it.

04:29.530 --> 04:30.729
We're checking on it.

04:30.731 --> 04:32.297
Hey, ma'am. Hey,
can you hear me?

04:33.666 --> 04:35.067
Hey!
It's locked. Hey.

04:35.069 --> 04:37.936
Jamie, we got to get in.
Yep.

04:43.076 --> 04:44.376
Hey, are you okay?
Hey, can you hear me?

04:44.378 --> 04:46.345
Hello! Hey!
All right.

04:46.347 --> 04:48.480
I'm getting her out.
Hey, Eddie, call a bus.

04:48.482 --> 04:49.681
Central, 12 David,
we have a female

04:49.683 --> 04:50.916
approximately 18 years of age,

04:50.918 --> 04:52.451
unconscious at
this location.

04:52.453 --> 04:53.785
We need a bus forthwith

04:53.787 --> 04:56.188
at West 44 and 11th Avenue.

04:56.190 --> 04:57.522
She okay?
What's happening?

04:57.524 --> 04:58.991
I'm not getting anything.
How far out is that bus?

04:58.993 --> 05:01.260
We're gonna need more

05:01.262 --> 05:02.694
than CPR.

05:02.696 --> 05:04.296
Okay, you take over.
I'm gonna give her the Naloxone.

05:04.298 --> 05:05.597
Go.

05:07.533 --> 05:09.735
Do you think that'll
reverse the overdose?

05:09.737 --> 05:11.003
Okay. Set.

05:11.005 --> 05:12.838
Come on, sweetheart,
get up.

05:12.840 --> 05:14.573
Let's get up.

05:14.575 --> 05:15.841
Come on.

05:15.843 --> 05:17.342
Come on,
hey.

05:17.344 --> 05:19.878
Hey. Hey, you hear me?

05:19.880 --> 05:20.912
What's your name? Hey!

05:20.914 --> 05:22.581
Jamie, Jamie,
she's not waking up.

05:22.583 --> 05:24.216
Hey, can you hear me?
Can you hear anything? Hey!

05:24.218 --> 05:25.350
Nothing's happening, Jamie.
Nothing's working.

05:30.290 --> 05:34.290

<i>What did you find</i>

05:56.852 --> 05:58.418
when you ran the
ex-husband, David Rossi?

05:58.420 --> 06:01.488
A few misdemeanor assault
collars from a few years ago.

06:01.490 --> 06:04.558
Apparently, David Rossi owns
a lucrative paving company.

06:04.560 --> 06:07.494
And Jessica win over a million
in assets in the divorce.

06:07.496 --> 06:09.563
So much for
that million now.

06:09.565 --> 06:10.997
She won every cent
she asked for,

06:10.999 --> 06:12.933
including full custody
of the kids.

06:12.935 --> 06:14.768
I wonder how she
pulled that off.

06:14.770 --> 06:17.137
Apparently, Nick testified
against his father

06:17.139 --> 06:18.839
in the divorce hearing.

06:18.841 --> 06:20.207
See, that's something
I'll never understand.

06:20.209 --> 06:21.775
You know, parents,
they always say

06:21.777 --> 06:22.876
it's all about the kids.

06:22.878 --> 06:23.977
They don't want to
put them through hell,

06:23.979 --> 06:25.212
then they throw them
on the stand

06:25.214 --> 06:26.513
as soon as they see
dollar signs.

06:27.150 --> 06:28.883
Yeah, I think
he wanted to.

06:28.885 --> 06:30.051
What makes you say that?

06:30.053 --> 06:32.386
Nick gave
convincing testimony

06:32.388 --> 06:35.356
that his father physically
and verbally abused them.

06:35.358 --> 06:38.326
Physically abusive
ex-husband.

06:38.328 --> 06:41.729
I guess it's time
to pay him a visit.

06:51.106 --> 06:52.640
We'll wait till
she wakes up.

06:52.642 --> 06:55.076
Now might not be the time
to ask her questions.

06:55.078 --> 06:57.745
She'll have to spend
the night here, sober up.

06:57.747 --> 06:59.046
Will a guardian
be joining her?

06:59.048 --> 07:00.314
No.

07:00.316 --> 07:01.983
Certainly someone
should call her parents.

07:01.985 --> 07:03.284
You must have her phone.

07:03.826 --> 07:07.070
She's 18. Legally, she's an adult.

07:07.071 --> 07:09.223
When can we move her to the
precinct and process her arrest?

07:09.224 --> 07:12.101
We have her on an Naloxone drip.

07:12.103 --> 07:13.569
When we think she can
sustain without it,

07:13.571 --> 07:15.104
once the heroin's
out of her system,

07:15.106 --> 07:16.672
you guys can take her.

07:16.674 --> 07:18.674
But she's gonna be okay?

07:18.676 --> 07:20.175
Because of you,
she should be.

07:21.344 --> 07:23.078
She might be a little sick,
probably try to get away.

07:23.080 --> 07:24.246
Most of them do.

07:24.248 --> 07:25.347
We'll make sure
she doesn't.

07:25.349 --> 07:28.283
She seems awfully young.

07:28.285 --> 07:31.253
When she's good to go, just let
the guarding officer know.

07:31.255 --> 07:33.122
Okay.

07:35.692 --> 07:37.893
Hi, Gina.

07:37.895 --> 07:40.095
I'm Nurse Labrant. I'll
be taking care of you.

07:40.097 --> 07:42.931
Um, I'm fine. I don't need to be
taken care of. Where's my car?

07:42.933 --> 07:44.933
You're not getting
your car, Gina.

07:44.935 --> 07:47.302
What are you guys doing here?

07:47.304 --> 07:48.504
Do you realize that
you're under arrest?

07:48.506 --> 07:50.572
How are you
feeling, Gina?

07:50.574 --> 07:53.075
I-I'm fine.

07:53.077 --> 07:54.943
Where'd you get
the heroin?

07:57.180 --> 07:59.014
I-I don't know.

07:59.016 --> 08:00.949
Um, I don't remember.

08:00.951 --> 08:02.151
Um, what is this?

08:02.153 --> 08:03.685
I'll explain everything.

08:03.687 --> 08:04.787
Feel better, Gina.

08:04.789 --> 08:06.255
Let's go.

08:18.802 --> 08:20.569
But we have it under control?

08:20.571 --> 08:23.505
No. We have it
under control for now.

08:23.507 --> 08:25.774
Since when are we
on different teams?

08:25.776 --> 08:27.776
Since my officers
were put in the crossfire

08:27.778 --> 08:29.211
and you put them there.

08:29.213 --> 08:31.713
I didn't expect this to go
without any conflict.

08:31.715 --> 08:35.082
Madame Mayor, ESU can only
sustain this for so long.

08:35.085 --> 08:39.121
You need to reinstate the option
of solitary confinement.

08:39.123 --> 08:41.657
What we need is patience
and perspective.

08:41.659 --> 08:43.625
Yeah, well, we're
fresh out of that.

08:44.360 --> 08:46.428
All due respect.

08:46.430 --> 08:48.130
I'm not sure

08:48.132 --> 08:51.133
what Lieutenant Gormley's role
here is.

08:51.135 --> 08:53.602
When I want to know
what the boots on the ground

08:53.604 --> 08:55.337
are saying, I look to him.

08:55.339 --> 08:57.539
I am making him
available to you.

09:00.877 --> 09:02.978
Is there anything you can add

09:02.980 --> 09:06.381
besides the boots on the ground
don't like this policy?

09:06.383 --> 09:08.750
- Yes. Why they don't like it.
- Okay.

09:08.752 --> 09:12.855
It elevates the so-called rights
of the incarcerated felons

09:12.857 --> 09:16.658
over the CO's ability
to safely do their jobs.

09:16.660 --> 09:19.461
It's causing way
more harm than good.

09:19.463 --> 09:21.997
So was solitary confinement.

09:21.999 --> 09:23.532
It's not the
same thing.

09:23.534 --> 09:25.501
We're not here
to defend solitary.

09:25.503 --> 09:28.537
We are here to protest
your policy as it stands.

09:28.539 --> 09:31.573
It's like a dry run
with live people involved.

09:31.575 --> 09:34.943
And we got dozens of ESU
officers in on their day off,

09:34.945 --> 09:37.546
and dozens more
on extended tours.

09:37.548 --> 09:40.849
40% of all prison suicides

09:40.851 --> 09:42.885
take place in solitary.

09:42.887 --> 09:45.621
Not to mention, it costs our
taxpayers $78,000

09:45.623 --> 09:47.222
per inmate, per year,

09:47.224 --> 09:49.358
to more or less
facilitate those deaths.

09:49.360 --> 09:50.592
Is this about a budget?

09:50.594 --> 09:52.895
At the end of the day,
we all live by a budget.

09:52.897 --> 09:54.863
At the end of this day,
some may not.

09:54.865 --> 09:55.931
May not what?

09:55.933 --> 09:57.399
Live.

09:57.401 --> 09:59.434
And if it's a CO
or one of my officers,

09:59.436 --> 10:00.536
there's gonna be hell to pay.

10:00.538 --> 10:03.138
And if it's an inmate

10:03.140 --> 10:06.475
that life somehow matters less,
Frank?

10:06.477 --> 10:07.743
I didn't say that.

10:07.745 --> 10:11.580
Any life lost to this kind
of fuzzy social experimenting

10:11.582 --> 10:13.415
is a waste.

10:13.417 --> 10:15.284
<i>Any</i> life.

10:27.063 --> 10:29.631
So, you save a life,
and now you're just gonna let it

10:29.633 --> 10:31.500
get ruined by
the system?

10:31.502 --> 10:33.569
That drug saved her, not me.

10:33.571 --> 10:36.004
Right. You <i>and</i>
the miracle drug.

10:36.006 --> 10:38.607
You think that drug
is a miracle?

10:38.609 --> 10:40.475
What do you mean?
Of course it is.

10:40.477 --> 10:42.344
You know, it's not just EMTs and
hospitals that have it anymore--

10:42.346 --> 10:43.845
the addicts carry it around.
So what,

10:43.847 --> 10:45.148
are we just supposed
to let people die?

10:45.149 --> 10:47.317
All I'm saying is, I don't know
if it's such a good thing

10:47.318 --> 10:48.917
to make an OD
less threatening.

10:48.919 --> 10:50.152
She messed up.

10:50.154 --> 10:51.753
Haven't you ever
messed up as a teenager?

10:51.755 --> 10:53.822
Did you ever... get
caught with pot

10:53.824 --> 10:56.391
or stupidly drive drunk?

10:56.393 --> 10:59.561
I don't know. Not really.

10:59.563 --> 11:02.864
Well, it must be nice
being so perfect.

11:03.968 --> 11:06.234
You know what,
I can't help but wonder,

11:06.236 --> 11:07.536
if she were different...

11:07.538 --> 11:08.937
What do you mean?

11:08.939 --> 11:11.139
If she were a poor male,

11:11.141 --> 11:12.641
more like the people
we typically arrest...

11:12.643 --> 11:14.276
Don't even go there, Reagan.

11:14.278 --> 11:16.278
It's like you see yourself
in her or something.

11:16.280 --> 11:17.779
How can you say that?

11:17.781 --> 11:19.948
I don't know,
I'm just saying it how I see it.

11:26.522 --> 11:29.358
You know where I can find
David Rossi?

11:32.695 --> 11:34.596
David Rossi.

11:34.598 --> 11:38.133
Police. Need to ask
you a few questions.

11:38.135 --> 11:41.303
Look... you obviously
don't know my ex-wife and I

11:41.305 --> 11:43.438
if you think I can help you.

11:43.440 --> 11:45.207
Uh-huh.
We weren't exactly

11:45.209 --> 11:46.575
on speaking terms.

11:46.577 --> 11:47.542
Okay. Well, when's the last time

11:47.544 --> 11:48.744
you did speak to her?

11:51.080 --> 11:53.882
Maybe... two years ago.

11:53.884 --> 11:55.417
We've exchanged words since,

11:55.419 --> 11:57.519
but I don't think
it qualifies as talking.

11:57.521 --> 11:59.621
Did your wife
have any enemies?

11:59.623 --> 12:02.190
No. I mean, she was
a real pain in the ass,

12:02.192 --> 12:04.393
but she never pissed
anyone off for real.

12:04.395 --> 12:06.962
- How about you?
- Enemies?

12:06.964 --> 12:08.330
I got a few.

12:08.332 --> 12:10.966
But anybody who knows anything
wouldn't go after Jessie

12:10.968 --> 12:12.567
to get back at me.

12:12.569 --> 12:15.270
At least... not anymore.

12:15.272 --> 12:17.072
How about before, who'd
go after her before?

12:17.074 --> 12:18.440
I didn't mean it like that.

12:18.442 --> 12:20.108
How'd you mean it?
When Jessie and I

12:20.110 --> 12:21.643
were good, we were good.

12:21.645 --> 12:23.278
I was protective--

12:23.280 --> 12:24.680
you couldn't get past me
to her if you tried.

12:24.682 --> 12:26.815
So then where were you
Monday afternoon?

12:27.650 --> 12:29.651
You think I did it?

12:29.653 --> 12:31.253
The mother of my children?

12:31.255 --> 12:33.155
Hey, I'm just checking
off all the boxes.

12:33.157 --> 12:34.389
My oldest found her.

12:34.391 --> 12:36.558
You think I would
do that to him?

12:36.560 --> 12:38.126
Your oldest testified
against you in court--

12:38.128 --> 12:39.461
I'm sure that
pissed you off.

12:39.463 --> 12:42.431
But I don't go
and kill his mother!

12:42.433 --> 12:43.899
Hey, I'm still talking to you.

12:43.901 --> 12:45.100
Hey!

12:45.102 --> 12:46.568
Charley!

12:48.237 --> 12:50.605
Charley!

12:50.607 --> 12:53.508
This lunatic thinks
I have to talk to him.

12:53.510 --> 12:56.044
Well, my client
has nothing to say.

12:56.046 --> 12:59.047
Oh. You're his lawyer?
You keep a lawyer on call?

12:59.049 --> 13:00.916
Charley works
for my company.

13:00.918 --> 13:02.884
Not that it's any

13:02.886 --> 13:05.687
Yeah, we need to
ask you to leave.

people keep lawyers

13:08.826 --> 13:10.325

mean to cause you any trouble.

13:29.294 --> 13:31.394
It's no trouble--
it's my job.

13:31.396 --> 13:33.796
Please don't tell my
dad, I'm begging you.

13:33.798 --> 13:35.765
This isn't a hundred-dollar
parking ticket.

13:35.767 --> 13:37.834
How much is it
gonna cost?

13:37.836 --> 13:39.836
Thousands of dollars--
depending on the lawyer.

13:39.838 --> 13:41.804
Wait. Wait. I'm
gonna need a lawyer?

13:41.806 --> 13:44.173
And pay a potential fee,
maybe several.

13:44.175 --> 13:45.942
Can you afford that?

13:45.944 --> 13:47.677
No.

13:55.085 --> 13:57.019
You should tell
your parents, Gina.

13:57.021 --> 13:59.288
No, no, no. They will
absolutely kill me.

13:59.290 --> 14:01.090
You almost did that
for yourself.

14:05.829 --> 14:08.197
I screwed up, and...

14:08.199 --> 14:09.699
and now I don't
know what to do.

14:09.701 --> 14:11.501
You're gonna need help.

14:11.503 --> 14:13.870
They're not gonna
help me with this.

14:13.872 --> 14:15.505

14:15.507 --> 14:17.907
and the insurance
that comes along with it?

14:17.909 --> 14:19.475
- My parents.
- Exactly.

14:19.477 --> 14:21.844
Okay, but what do I say?

14:24.348 --> 14:26.015
You're asking my advice?

14:26.017 --> 14:27.450
Please.

14:28.419 --> 14:30.653
You could start
by telling them what happened.

14:32.590 --> 14:35.792
They're gonna be
so disappointed.

14:35.794 --> 14:38.713

What was it, your ACL?

14:38.714 --> 14:39.715
What?

14:39.739 --> 14:41.565
I saw the soccer
bumper sticker on your car.

14:41.566 --> 14:43.866

MCL.

14:43.868 --> 14:45.568
MCL. And they put you on oxy?

14:45.570 --> 14:47.003
Yeah.

14:47.005 --> 14:48.738
For a couple months.

14:48.740 --> 14:50.306
Then the prescription ran out.

14:50.308 --> 14:52.341
Yeah.

14:52.343 --> 14:54.043

was embarrassed

19:53.819 --> 19:55.552
I'm sorry about
what I said.

19:55.554 --> 19:56.786
It's okay.

19:56.788 --> 19:58.655
There might be
some truth to it.

19:58.657 --> 20:00.089
Doesn't matter, I
shouldn't have said it.

20:00.091 --> 20:01.891
Besides, you were
right about one thing,

20:01.893 --> 20:03.426
she is totally clueless.

20:03.428 --> 20:06.396
Think there's anything
we can do to help?

20:06.398 --> 20:08.465
Maybe. I think so.

20:08.467 --> 20:10.133
You know, when I was 18,

20:10.135 --> 20:12.635
I swear, I was
much more mature.

20:12.637 --> 20:14.170
I find that
hard to believe.

20:14.172 --> 20:15.705
Come on. I got to go
process her arrest.

20:15.707 --> 20:17.106
The parents just left.
I don't think that was such

20:17.108 --> 20:19.209
an easy conversation.
I could use your help.

20:21.479 --> 20:22.600
I do like this look
on you, Reagan.

20:22.624 --> 20:23.914
Hmm?

20:23.915 --> 20:25.915
You're a real softy.

20:25.917 --> 20:28.284
Ugh.

20:29.854 --> 20:31.554
Gina?
What the hell happened?

20:31.556 --> 20:33.923
- Gina!
- What happened? What happened?

20:33.925 --> 20:36.359
She's not breathing.

20:36.361 --> 20:38.127
You administered Naloxone?
Twice.

20:38.129 --> 20:39.362
Try again.

20:40.931 --> 20:43.933
I'm sorry. She's gone.

20:45.636 --> 20:46.936
Move, move, move.

20:46.938 --> 20:50.306
Hey, Gina.
Gina, hey, hey.

20:50.308 --> 20:52.742
Hey, Gina. Come back to us.
Hey, Gina, come back.

20:52.744 --> 20:54.077
Come on. Come back to us.

20:54.079 --> 20:55.245
Come on, Gina.
Gina, come on. Come back.

20:55.247 --> 20:57.213
Put in a second call
for a bus.

20:59.149 --> 21:01.251
Come on, Gina.
Come back, hey.

21:13.923 --> 21:15.875
I'm pulling my people
in 24 hours.

21:15.899 --> 21:17.093
You won't do that.

21:17.094 --> 21:18.994
I've got an officer
badly wounded.

21:18.996 --> 21:20.362
They're not sticking around
for more.

21:20.364 --> 21:22.430
You would leave the
correctional officers there

21:22.432 --> 21:24.599
without any backup?
Of course not.

21:24.601 --> 21:26.034
You'll call the governor

21:26.036 --> 21:28.503
and request state troopers
and National Guard.

21:28.505 --> 21:30.638
I don't take orders from you.
It's not an order.

21:30.640 --> 21:32.207
When you say it...
You have every right

21:32.209 --> 21:33.675
to ignore my advice,

21:33.677 --> 21:36.011
and I have every right
to act when you do so.

21:36.013 --> 21:37.078
You work for me.

21:37.080 --> 21:39.781
I work for my police officers.

21:39.783 --> 21:41.850
They're not canaries
in your coal mine.

21:41.852 --> 21:43.718
Don't you paint me
with that brush.

21:43.720 --> 21:46.321
My cops and your detail,
ask them.

21:46.323 --> 21:49.491
They'll tell you you're making
a huge mistake with this

21:49.493 --> 21:51.793
identity politics take
on prison reform.

21:51.795 --> 21:53.795
You're a real piece
of work, Frank.

21:53.797 --> 21:55.697
And the governor
has the power to fire me.

21:55.699 --> 21:57.632
- I know that.
-Just checking.

21:57.634 --> 21:59.267
Call Albany.

22:01.670 --> 22:02.704
Let me clarify.

22:02.706 --> 22:05.006
You left her alone,
out of a cell,

22:05.008 --> 22:08.243
for long enough to go
unconscious and be surrounded

22:08.245 --> 22:10.011
by a dozen or so officers...
To talk to her parents.

22:10.013 --> 22:11.679
...where she subsequently died.

22:14.583 --> 22:15.750
Do you let all of your prisoners

22:15.752 --> 22:17.118
make themselves at home
in the precinct?

22:17.120 --> 22:18.553
Of course not.

22:18.555 --> 22:20.955
So you extend that courtesy
to just the females.

22:20.957 --> 22:23.792
Sergeant, that's
out of line.

22:23.794 --> 22:25.460
She was a kid.

22:25.462 --> 22:26.828
She needed her parents.

22:26.830 --> 22:28.296
Technically,
she was 18 years old.

22:28.298 --> 22:29.531
Have you met an 18-year-old?

22:29.533 --> 22:30.932
The attitude
isn't gonna help the fact

22:30.934 --> 22:33.001
that you and your partner failed
to follow proper procedures.

22:33.003 --> 22:34.369
Officer Janko had nothing
to do with this.

22:34.371 --> 22:36.371
I was the arresting officer.
I administered the Naloxone.

22:36.373 --> 22:38.807
How much previous training
did you have

22:38.809 --> 22:40.208
with the Naloxone device?

22:40.210 --> 22:41.543
I attended the
department training.

22:41.545 --> 22:43.578
Do you believe you administered
the fluids correctly?

22:43.580 --> 22:44.712
I did it as I was taught.

22:44.714 --> 22:46.848
And when you came upon
Ms. Walker unconscious,

22:46.850 --> 22:49.984
the second time,
did you use Naloxone?

22:49.986 --> 22:52.320
No. Other officers were
already trying to revive her.

22:52.322 --> 22:53.655
Without success.

22:53.657 --> 22:55.857
Look, the ME explained it to me.

22:55.859 --> 22:58.993
All the Naloxone does
is balance the heroin.

22:58.995 --> 23:01.496
The hospital misinterpreted
the amount in her system.

23:01.498 --> 23:04.499
We're not disputing if the
hospital is or is not to blame.

23:04.501 --> 23:07.702
We don't work for the hospital.
We work for NYPD.

23:07.704 --> 23:08.870
Well, they're the ones
that should be answering

23:08.872 --> 23:10.171
these questions, though, not me.

23:10.173 --> 23:12.240
Officer Reagan, you took part
in administering Naloxone

23:12.242 --> 23:13.775
into Ms. Walker's system.

23:13.777 --> 23:16.144
So you're telling me if I
sat back, waited for the EMTs,

23:16.146 --> 23:18.847
and didn't save her life,
I wouldn't be in this mess?

23:22.418 --> 23:26.020
That would make it
a pretty unusual case.

23:26.022 --> 23:28.890
If the murderer is a stranger
of a female victim,

23:28.892 --> 23:30.692
rarely does the rape kit
come up clean.

23:30.694 --> 23:33.962
No sexual assault,
no forced entry.

23:33.964 --> 23:35.296
It's gotta be
someone she knew.

23:35.298 --> 23:36.531
What else can you tell us?

23:36.533 --> 23:38.199
She did die quickly.

23:38.201 --> 23:40.168
The incision around her neck
was extremely deep.

23:40.170 --> 23:41.603
Killed her almost
instantaneously.

23:41.605 --> 23:43.171
Any idea what kind
of knife was used?

23:43.173 --> 23:44.405
Not a knife.

23:44.407 --> 23:46.107
More like some kind of tool.

23:46.109 --> 23:48.643
Tool like you'd find
in a toolbox?

23:48.645 --> 23:51.079
No. Tool like you'd find
in a toolshed.

23:51.081 --> 23:53.148
Something meant for wood,
maybe gardening.

23:53.150 --> 23:54.682
More like a machete.

23:54.684 --> 23:56.339
Did you see anybody
working around their place?

23:56.363 --> 23:57.486
No.

23:57.487 --> 24:00.622
But I did see her
perfect gel manicure.

24:00.624 --> 24:03.124
No way was she getting
those hands dirty.

24:03.126 --> 24:05.493
Right.

24:13.469 --> 24:16.070
You know, it kind of feels like
I'm the one being suspended,

24:16.072 --> 24:17.805
riding with Ramos,

24:17.807 --> 24:20.441
eating tuna fish
sandwiches all afternoon.

24:20.443 --> 24:22.277
Well, I'll trade places
with you any day.

24:22.279 --> 24:24.746
How is the Naloxone
retraining going?

24:24.748 --> 24:27.015
Just a constant reminder
of Gina's death.

24:27.783 --> 24:30.852
Yeah, we need
to try to move on.

24:30.854 --> 24:32.954
Gina's parents
aren't moving on.

24:32.956 --> 24:35.190
- They suing?
- Yep.

24:35.192 --> 24:36.457
I would.

24:36.459 --> 24:38.426
How are we supposed to know
you can have a second OD,

24:38.428 --> 24:39.961
24 hours after intake?

24:39.963 --> 24:41.663
It wasn't a second OD.

24:42.565 --> 24:44.032
It was the same one.

24:44.034 --> 24:45.533
What do you mean?

24:45.535 --> 24:48.803
She was just...

24:48.805 --> 24:51.472
too doped up on the drip
for anyone to tell

24:51.474 --> 24:54.676
that she still had
the heroin in her system.

24:54.678 --> 24:56.778
So the hospital's at fault,
not you.

24:56.780 --> 24:58.846
IAB doesn't care about that.

24:58.848 --> 25:00.848
You saved that girl's life
the first time,

25:00.850 --> 25:02.750
and you did the right thing.

25:02.752 --> 25:04.953
Says who?

25:04.955 --> 25:08.089
You treated that girl
like a human being, Jamie.

25:09.792 --> 25:11.726
I should have just
stayed out of it.

25:11.728 --> 25:13.294
We both should have.

25:14.563 --> 25:16.030
Then she would have been
in her cell.

25:16.032 --> 25:17.365
Who knows what would
have happened?

25:17.367 --> 25:19.133
She could have died
in her cell, too.

25:19.135 --> 25:21.502
Yeah, well, we'll never know.

25:21.504 --> 25:23.438
Right. We can play the "what
ifs" game all night if you want,

25:23.440 --> 25:26.608
but it's not gonna change
the fact that Gina's gone.

25:37.119 --> 25:39.254
I'm not exaggerating.

25:39.256 --> 25:40.521
It seems like
every other call these days

25:40.523 --> 25:42.991
is some version of kids
plus drugs equals tragedy.

25:42.993 --> 25:44.259
Another classmate

25:44.261 --> 25:46.294
from my high school overdosed
just last month.

25:46.296 --> 25:48.663
That's three in one year.
From?

25:48.665 --> 25:52.634
Fentanyl or heroin, not sure
what the final verdict was.

25:52.636 --> 25:54.756
I know two kids in my
neighborhood who died this year.

25:56.605 --> 25:57.839
"Knew them" knew them?

25:57.841 --> 25:58.840
Well, one kid's older brother,

25:58.842 --> 25:59.874
another kid's sister.

25:59.876 --> 26:01.009
Ah, you're way too young

26:01.011 --> 26:02.277
for that kind of tragedy.

26:02.279 --> 26:05.813
Tragedy doesn't have
a minimum age, sad to say.

26:05.815 --> 26:06.881
It's like the modern plague.

26:06.883 --> 26:07.982
Yeah, except it's worse.

26:07.984 --> 26:09.517
The plague is a sickness

26:09.519 --> 26:11.619
that you catch.
You don't go out and say,

26:11.621 --> 26:13.454
"Hey, let's score
some plague tonight."

26:13.456 --> 26:15.490
These kids are doing this
to themselves.

26:15.492 --> 26:17.592
And you can't just go,
"Just say no."

26:17.594 --> 26:20.695
Yeah, but sometimes the simplest
answer is the best one.

26:20.697 --> 26:22.063
And the right one.

26:22.065 --> 26:25.266
Not just a catchphrase--
the point, the education.

26:25.268 --> 26:26.401
That's right.

26:26.403 --> 26:27.669
Might not have solved
everything,

26:27.671 --> 26:29.671
- but "just say no" was a start.
- Yeah.

26:29.673 --> 26:30.972
Where did it come from?

26:30.974 --> 26:32.940
Really?

26:32.942 --> 26:35.810
Yeah. I mean,
I know it's a thing.

26:37.514 --> 26:39.647
Another Reagan,
believe it or not.

26:39.649 --> 26:41.382
First Lady Nancy.

26:41.384 --> 26:42.583
I think Dad's right.

26:42.585 --> 26:43.785
It comes down
to education.

26:43.787 --> 26:44.886
Or lack thereof,

26:44.888 --> 26:46.621
in this case.
Tell me something.

26:46.623 --> 26:48.690
How many of your
friends have you lost

26:48.692 --> 26:50.758
to drunk driving
accidents?

26:50.760 --> 26:51.559
None.

26:51.561 --> 26:52.393
None.

26:52.395 --> 26:53.061
None.

26:53.063 --> 26:54.295
Because...?

26:54.297 --> 26:55.630
Designated drivers.

26:55.632 --> 26:56.831
Taxis.

26:56.833 --> 26:58.132
And...?

26:58.134 --> 27:00.301
Because it's drilled into us
from kindergarten.

27:00.303 --> 27:02.270
Don't drink and drive.
Period.

27:02.272 --> 27:04.305
But heroin and cocaine?

27:04.307 --> 27:05.340
I mean,
it should

27:05.342 --> 27:06.974
go without saying.

27:06.976 --> 27:09.177
But clearly, it needs saying.

27:09.179 --> 27:12.313
It was kind of the opposite
when we were growing up.

27:12.315 --> 27:14.515
- "Drugs kill."
- Yeah,

27:14.517 --> 27:16.517
like that fried egg commercial,
where they crack the egg

27:16.519 --> 27:18.086
on the sizzling
frying pan.

27:18.088 --> 27:19.987
"This is your brain on drugs."

27:19.989 --> 27:21.155
That worked.

27:21.157 --> 27:23.391
Yeah. And how many
of your friends OD'd?

27:23.393 --> 27:24.859
None of 'em.
Me, neither.

27:24.861 --> 27:26.828
Yeah, but drunk
driving fatalities?

27:26.830 --> 27:28.830
- Eh...
- Three, four?

27:28.832 --> 27:29.831
At least.

27:29.833 --> 27:31.065
Jimmy Driscoll,
that's five.

27:31.067 --> 27:32.166
Yeah,

27:32.168 --> 27:33.634
so maybe the drilling
saved you from that.

27:33.636 --> 27:35.636
It's not like they said,
"Don't drink and drive,

27:35.638 --> 27:37.505
but go ahead and do drugs,"
you know?

27:37.507 --> 27:39.140
Don't, okay? Just don't.

27:39.142 --> 27:40.441
And if you see
your friends doing it,

27:40.443 --> 27:42.777
or even your enemies, bust 'em.

27:42.779 --> 27:43.911
We're not cops.

27:43.913 --> 27:44.946
I know that. I mean bust 'em

27:44.948 --> 27:47.382
the way other kids
do to each other.

27:47.384 --> 27:49.083
Whatever you have to do.

27:53.021 --> 27:55.656
When I think I've had
a tough week, I remember:

27:55.658 --> 27:58.593
not as tough as being
the parent of a teenager.

28:00.863 --> 28:03.631
Amen to that,
brother.

28:05.134 --> 28:06.534
Are you high?

28:15.277 --> 28:17.078
What's eating you?

28:17.080 --> 28:18.913
Nothing.

28:18.915 --> 28:21.082
Come on, you can't fool me.

28:21.084 --> 28:22.417
Just pissed off.

28:22.419 --> 28:23.651
At your dinner?

28:23.653 --> 28:25.119
Our screwed-up
system.

28:25.121 --> 28:27.855
Well, at least you're not
gonna lose your job.

28:27.857 --> 28:29.290
Yeah, I know,
I get it.

28:29.292 --> 28:31.759
I'm not gonna lose my job,
I should be happy. Right?

28:31.761 --> 28:33.961
I'm not saying
you have to be happy.

28:33.963 --> 28:35.563
God knows I'm not always happy.

28:35.565 --> 28:37.031
It's just...

28:37.033 --> 28:39.467
I was expected
to save her twice.

28:39.469 --> 28:42.537
And me, I couldn't believe
I saved her the first time.

28:42.539 --> 28:44.705
Well, you're gonna lose some,

28:44.707 --> 28:46.007
but you're gonna save some, too.

28:46.009 --> 28:47.675
It comes with the territory.

28:49.378 --> 28:51.045
I don't think we're gonna
put a dent in this world

28:51.047 --> 28:52.513
with drugs like heroin.

28:54.650 --> 28:56.384
Her death's not on you.

28:56.386 --> 28:58.486
That's not what I'm hearing.

29:00.122 --> 29:02.356
Should've seen her, sis.

29:02.358 --> 29:05.593
She came back to life
before my eyes.

29:07.830 --> 29:11.299
But it didn't matter;
I couldn't save her in the end.

29:11.301 --> 29:13.501
You did your best.

29:13.503 --> 29:15.303
And they're telling me
my best wasn't good enough.

29:15.305 --> 29:17.972
You do enough, Jamie.

29:20.542 --> 29:21.809
Do me a favor, will you?

29:21.811 --> 29:24.078
Tell the sergeants
down at IAB that.

29:31.453 --> 29:33.387
- Come on, would you just open up?
- Go away.

29:33.389 --> 29:35.823
Well, look, we're not here
to arrest you.

29:35.825 --> 29:36.824
Good.

29:36.826 --> 29:38.826
Then I'll say it again:
Go away.

29:41.898 --> 29:43.531
Hey, you know,
your kid gave you an alibi.

29:43.533 --> 29:44.565
What
do you want?

29:44.567 --> 29:45.633
We want your help,

29:45.635 --> 29:46.634
that's what we want.

29:46.636 --> 29:48.703
Now, why would I help you?

29:48.705 --> 29:50.071
Because you want
to help your kids.

29:50.073 --> 29:52.373
And because whoever did this
is someone your wife knew

29:52.375 --> 29:53.774
and it's probably someone
you knew.

29:55.078 --> 29:56.677
Two minutes.

29:59.482 --> 30:00.715
That's my partner,
Detective Baez.

30:00.717 --> 30:02.250
How are you?

30:02.252 --> 30:03.584
We made a list. We noted

30:03.586 --> 30:05.253
your ex-wife's, uh, FedEx guy,

30:05.255 --> 30:07.722
pizza delivery,
mailman, handyman,

30:07.724 --> 30:08.656
lawn service...

30:08.658 --> 30:09.824
No, that's wrong.

30:09.826 --> 30:11.392
Which?

30:11.394 --> 30:12.793
Joe's not doing the lawn
anymore.

30:14.129 --> 30:15.830
He's an old friend.

30:15.832 --> 30:17.498
Quit the business
a couple weeks ago.

30:17.500 --> 30:20.101
Well, did she bring in
a new landscaping company?

30:20.103 --> 30:21.435
Someone's been doing that lawn.

30:21.437 --> 30:22.670
Jessie would never

30:22.672 --> 30:23.905
leave it unattended.

30:23.907 --> 30:25.172
Well, where would she go?

30:25.174 --> 30:26.908
Yeah, she take recommendations
from friends, neighbors?

30:26.910 --> 30:28.776
- What?
- No, I doubt it.

30:28.778 --> 30:31.045
She liked to do things
on the cheap,

30:31.047 --> 30:32.513
unlike most people
in our neighborhood.

30:32.515 --> 30:34.749
Okay, well, if she didn't want
to hire local,

30:34.751 --> 30:35.883
where would she go?

30:35.885 --> 30:38.986
Her father used to hire guys

30:38.988 --> 30:40.721
outside the convenience store.

30:40.723 --> 30:42.056
You know, 7:00 a.m.,

30:42.058 --> 30:44.258
bunch of guys
wait to get work for the day.

30:44.260 --> 30:45.693
Day laborers.

30:45.695 --> 30:47.528
I know where to go.
Then let's go.

31:15.720 --> 31:17.186
Take the keys out
of the ignition,

31:17.188 --> 31:18.388
put your hands on the wheel.

31:18.390 --> 31:19.822
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

31:19.824 --> 31:21.124
Officers, I-I swear, I don't...
Relax.

31:21.126 --> 31:22.658
We're not Immigration.

31:22.660 --> 31:24.360
We're investigating a homicide.
We need you to answer questions.

31:24.362 --> 31:25.561
Get your hands on the wheel.
Homicide?

31:25.563 --> 31:27.063
I don't know anything
about a homicide.

31:27.065 --> 31:28.364
You recognize this woman?

31:28.366 --> 31:29.899
Did you hire someone
to do her lawn?

31:29.901 --> 31:32.802
Uh, I don't think so?

31:32.804 --> 31:34.837
Maybe you'll think better
down at the squad room?

31:34.839 --> 31:36.105
No, no, no, no,
that won't be necessary.

31:36.107 --> 31:37.673
Who did you hire to do her lawn?

31:37.675 --> 31:39.008
Some guy.

31:39.010 --> 31:40.910
- He hasn't been around here lately.
- I wonder why.

31:40.912 --> 31:42.512
Come with us.
Show us where he is.

31:42.514 --> 31:45.114
- I don't want to.
- Sure, you do.

31:45.116 --> 31:46.783
We'll get you a bacon, egg
and cheese on the way. Let's go.

31:46.785 --> 31:48.351
okay, okay, okay.
Yeah. Thank you.

31:54.391 --> 31:56.392
All right, boss man.
Is that the guy?

31:56.394 --> 31:59.128
Yeah, that's the guy. Arturo.

31:59.130 --> 32:01.798
You sit tight.

32:06.403 --> 32:07.503
Excuse me.

32:07.505 --> 32:09.071
Wondering if you
could help us out.

32:09.073 --> 32:11.774
We're a little bit lost.
We're looking for number 214.

32:13.811 --> 32:16.078
You want to help us out?

32:17.948 --> 32:19.482
Hey!

32:19.983 --> 32:21.451
Hey!

32:23.787 --> 32:26.189
Hold it!

32:33.597 --> 32:36.199
Arturo?

32:36.201 --> 32:37.800
Hey, man, we just want to talk.

32:37.802 --> 32:40.470
All right?

32:42.873 --> 32:44.440
Yah!

32:45.309 --> 32:46.409
Didn't anybody
ever tell you

32:46.411 --> 32:48.444
not to bring a shovel
to a gunfight?

32:48.446 --> 32:50.913
Get on your feet.

32:50.915 --> 32:53.449
Get on your feet!

32:53.451 --> 32:55.818
Tell this scumbag
he's under arrest

32:55.820 --> 32:56.986
for menacing an officer.

32:56.988 --> 32:58.488
I think he knows.

33:02.559 --> 33:05.661
Commissioner,
were you expecting the mayor?

33:06.497 --> 33:08.898
No.

33:08.900 --> 33:11.033
She is in the building
and on her way up.

33:12.504 --> 33:14.270
Actually,
she is off the elevator,

33:14.272 --> 33:16.005
and she looks locked and loaded.

33:16.007 --> 33:17.306
Madam Mayor.

33:17.308 --> 33:19.041
Do you know

33:19.043 --> 33:21.277
who couldn't get the time of day

33:21.279 --> 33:23.613
or a glass of water in Albany?

33:23.615 --> 33:25.081
You.

33:25.083 --> 33:26.616
I could've told you that.

33:28.118 --> 33:30.853
The governor and AG agree 100%

33:30.855 --> 33:33.322
on who they'd like to see
as commissioner.

33:33.324 --> 33:34.257
Who?

33:34.259 --> 33:35.658
ABY.
Abby who?

33:35.660 --> 33:38.861
A-B-Y: anybody but you.

33:38.863 --> 33:41.030
Ah.

33:41.032 --> 33:43.533
They said no to backup.

33:43.535 --> 33:47.537
I had to reinstate
the solitary confinement option

33:47.539 --> 33:51.107
against my better judgment.

33:51.109 --> 33:54.477
Well, I guess all's well
that ends well.

33:54.479 --> 33:57.580
I ended up defending you.

33:57.582 --> 34:00.750
That was painful, Frank.

34:03.921 --> 34:05.755
Here's a revised proposal.

34:07.624 --> 34:09.257
What changed your mind?

34:09.260 --> 34:12.762
Detective Clarice Bunuel.

34:12.764 --> 34:15.697
Sorry. Doesn't ring a bell.

34:15.699 --> 34:17.500
She's on my detail.

34:17.502 --> 34:18.668
Oh.

34:18.670 --> 34:20.335
She has a psychology degree

34:20.338 --> 34:23.773
that specializes
in anger management,

34:23.775 --> 34:26.409
and she is smart.

34:26.411 --> 34:30.112
That's good to hear.

34:30.114 --> 34:32.547
Would you look at that?

34:32.550 --> 34:35.885
I'd appreciate your thoughts.

34:38.822 --> 34:41.623
Done.

34:42.458 --> 34:45.393
Thank you.

34:45.396 --> 34:49.431
And, Frank, remember
when you compared yourself

34:49.434 --> 34:51.701
to those old buildings?

34:51.703 --> 34:54.136
They're an eyesore
till they get torn down,

34:54.138 --> 34:56.105
and then they're beloved?

34:56.107 --> 34:59.575
Well, that was just a metaphor.

34:59.577 --> 35:03.279
Well, you know
what really happens?

35:03.281 --> 35:06.849
Couple of people bitch
for a couple of weeks,

35:06.851 --> 35:09.785
and then life just goes on.

35:13.957 --> 35:16.425
No one is indispensable.

35:16.427 --> 35:19.929
Certainly not me.

35:19.931 --> 35:22.131
But not you, either.

35:23.100 --> 35:25.301
Good day.

35:56.466 --> 35:59.135
Officer Reagan?

35:59.137 --> 36:00.903
I didn't mean to interrupt.

36:00.905 --> 36:03.939
You here to visit Gina?

36:03.941 --> 36:05.307
I came to drop these,

36:05.309 --> 36:07.309
but I understand
you wouldn't want me here.

36:07.311 --> 36:09.512
Come over here.

36:16.386 --> 36:18.421
I'm sorry.

36:18.423 --> 36:20.423
Please, don't apologize.

36:20.425 --> 36:21.557
Aren't you in the middle

36:21.559 --> 36:22.792
of suing the department?

36:22.794 --> 36:25.895
No. Not anymore.

36:25.897 --> 36:28.197
But it doesn't matter, really.

36:28.199 --> 36:30.266
Blame's not gonna
bring her back.

36:30.268 --> 36:32.101
I'm so sorry.

36:32.103 --> 36:33.669
What you must
be going through...

36:34.971 --> 36:36.639
Officer Reagan...

36:36.641 --> 36:38.941
Jamie, please. Call me Jamie.

36:38.943 --> 36:42.912
Jamie. I've been wanting
to thank you.

36:45.515 --> 36:47.149
If it wasn't for you,

36:47.151 --> 36:49.051
we wouldn't have gotten to see
our little girl

36:49.053 --> 36:51.320
before she passed away.

36:51.322 --> 36:53.322
Wouldn't have been able
to touch her,

36:53.324 --> 36:55.624
to hug her.

36:55.626 --> 36:58.894
We owe nobody but you for that.

37:24.321 --> 37:25.621
Come in.

37:25.623 --> 37:27.123
Thanks.

37:31.027 --> 37:32.428
You don't go away.

37:32.430 --> 37:34.363
- Do you?
- We got him.

37:38.135 --> 37:40.736
- Who was it?
- Landscaper.

37:40.738 --> 37:42.738
Arturo Alvarez.

37:42.740 --> 37:45.274
- I don't know him.
- He's only been cutting her lawn

37:45.276 --> 37:47.143
for a few weeks,
but she caught him

37:47.145 --> 37:49.645
sneaking upstairs
that afternoon.

37:49.647 --> 37:51.914
He freaked out
and didn't let her live

37:51.916 --> 37:54.617
to tell about him.
Son of a bitch should rot in jail.

37:54.619 --> 37:56.051
He will.

37:56.053 --> 37:57.953
You always make house calls?

37:57.955 --> 38:01.624
Not usually, but, uh...

38:01.626 --> 38:03.626
didn't really come here
for this.

38:03.628 --> 38:06.061
- Do you m...?
- Yeah.

38:07.931 --> 38:09.165
Look, I was giving it
some thought,

38:09.167 --> 38:10.900
and I kind of realized
you and me,

38:10.902 --> 38:13.235
believe it or not,
may have something in common.

38:13.237 --> 38:14.870
Oh, yeah? What's that?

38:14.872 --> 38:19.141
Well, my wife died
a few months back, too.

38:21.044 --> 38:23.345
I'm sorry to hear that.

38:23.347 --> 38:24.580
It's all right.

38:24.582 --> 38:27.583
Thing is, she left me
with two teenage boys,

38:27.585 --> 38:29.819
and, way I see it,
it's kind of like

38:29.821 --> 38:31.587
having a big,
new job now.

38:31.589 --> 38:33.689
You know, I got
to make sure

38:33.691 --> 38:35.524
that the one parent
those boys do have

38:35.526 --> 38:38.060
is the best possible parent
he could be.

38:38.062 --> 38:40.696
So finding myself
making breakfasts

38:40.698 --> 38:43.732
and lunches
and talking about emotions

38:43.734 --> 38:47.269
and things I never
really had to do as a father.

38:47.271 --> 38:48.804
I don't picture you in an apron.

38:48.806 --> 38:51.373
I can't cook
a TV dinner, okay?

38:51.375 --> 38:55.110
But, in many ways,

38:55.112 --> 38:59.014
it's been the best opportunity
of my life.

38:59.016 --> 39:02.251
An opportunity
that I might not have taken...

39:02.253 --> 39:05.020
probably wouldn't
have stepped up for if not...

39:05.022 --> 39:08.657
Look, my children
don't want that from me.

39:08.659 --> 39:11.193
Do you really believe that?

39:13.463 --> 39:15.564
I mean, who did Nick call

39:15.566 --> 39:18.033
when he was afraid?

39:18.035 --> 39:21.403
Who did he turn to
when he didn't know what to do?

39:23.240 --> 39:26.141
Me.

39:26.143 --> 39:28.344
Yeah, you.

39:30.614 --> 39:33.716
And yet here you are,
wasting that opportunity.

39:36.453 --> 39:38.954
Maybe it's not my place,

39:38.956 --> 39:42.791
and if I'm out of line,
I apologize, but...

39:42.793 --> 39:45.628
your kids are growing up.

39:45.630 --> 39:46.929
They're gonna be
graduating school,

39:46.931 --> 39:49.865
having families,
falling in love.

39:49.867 --> 39:51.700
Father to father,

39:51.702 --> 39:53.669
don't you want
to be part of that?

39:54.504 --> 39:57.172
I do.

39:57.174 --> 39:59.174
Maybe it's time
to put on your big boy pants

39:59.176 --> 40:01.677
and be a dad again, huh?

40:08.551 --> 40:12.321
I'm sure your kids
could use one.
