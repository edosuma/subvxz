Mm-mmm.

01:20.860 --> 01:22.860
I heard something then.

01:22.940 --> 01:24.580

jackhammering )

07:18.460 --> 07:20.500
This is gonna make you
turn it off!

07:25.940 --> 07:27.260

07:27.340 --> 07:30.460
I want you on this.
We got a real problem!

07:30.540 --> 07:31.940
They turn it on...

07:35.740 --> 07:38.100
Will you sign this

07:38.180 --> 07:39.460
Eh?

07:48.500 --> 07:50.100
Yoo-hoo!
