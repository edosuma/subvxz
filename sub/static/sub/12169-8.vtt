00:02.527 --> 00:06.645
- The princess is going to play.
- Where’s the princess ?

00:07.087 --> 00:08.998
- Where’s the princess-- ?
- Right there.

00:09.167 --> 00:10.680
Which one ?

00:11.927 --> 00:12.962
Put this one...

00:13.127 --> 00:15.243
This is how they
need to get around, right ?

00:16.447 --> 00:19.200
Go inside the train.

00:55.567 --> 00:57.239
Hello ?

01:01.207 --> 01:02.845
Madison ?

01:04.887 --> 01:06.400
Honey ?

01:15.087 --> 01:16.520
Hi.

01:17.047 --> 01:18.560
Oh, hey.

01:18.727 --> 01:19.876
So...

01:21.007 --> 01:22.281
... how was your day ?

01:26.927 --> 01:28.121
Send it to Graeme Peel.

01:28.327 --> 01:31.558
Graeme has better things to do
than look over my nonsensical scribbles.

01:31.727 --> 01:34.287
Well, they didn’t look nonsensical
to me.

01:34.447 --> 01:35.926
Okay, fine, they did.

01:36.087 --> 01:39.079
l’m an English major.
What the hell do l know ? Send it.

01:39.247 --> 01:41.363
Look, what’ve you got to lose ?

01:42.567 --> 01:45.843
- Good night.
- Good night.

02:08.327 --> 02:09.999
l’Il get it.

02:18.647 --> 02:20.956
- Jean Miller ?
- Yes.

02:21.127 --> 02:25.279
Hi, l’m Lieutenant Colonel Samantha
Carter of the United States Air Force.

02:25.447 --> 02:26.436
Okay.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.046
Did you send a math proof...

02:28.207 --> 02:32.041
... to Professor Graeme Peel
of the California Institute of Technology ?

02:32.567 --> 02:34.842
Was l not supposed to ?

02:36.607 --> 02:37.596
Sorry to interrupt.

02:37.767 --> 02:40.201
You need to pack your toothbrush,
head back to Earth.

02:40.367 --> 02:42.403
- l do ? Why ?
- Carter needs help.

02:43.287 --> 02:45.562
- With what ?
- Your sister.

03:59.167 --> 04:02.079
- Welcome back to Earth.
- Yes, yes. What has my sister done ?

04:02.247 --> 04:03.600
Good to see you too, McKay.

04:03.767 --> 04:06.839
Greetings, salutations, pleasantries.
What’s she done ?

04:22.447 --> 04:24.085
l thought that--

04:27.247 --> 04:29.920
Well, it’s certainly
some very interesting stuff...

04:30.087 --> 04:33.966
... but, no, can’t be her work. l mean,
she’s been out of the game for years.

04:34.127 --> 04:35.242
The game ?

04:35.407 --> 04:39.195
Yeah. She hasn’t published a single
theoretical-physics paper in four years.

04:39.367 --> 04:41.119
Oh, that game.

04:41.287 --> 04:43.881
She was on a fast track
to some pretty exciting grants...

04:44.047 --> 04:45.480
... doing some interesting work.

04:45.647 --> 04:49.879
l mean, she was no me, of course,
but she was at least a you.

04:50.367 --> 04:55.122
Anyway, she got herself knocked up
by some English major...

04:55.287 --> 04:57.164
... and priorities shifted overnight.

04:57.367 --> 05:00.916
Tried to talk some sense into her,
but she’s a tad on the stubborn side.

05:01.087 --> 05:02.884
When was the last time
you spoke to her ?

05:03.047 --> 05:04.526
- Four years, maybe.
- Four years ?

05:04.727 --> 05:07.605
Not that l didn’t check to see
if she’s published.

05:08.887 --> 05:10.923
You realize what this proof means,
right ?

05:11.087 --> 05:14.238
- Yes, if the math checks out.
- l’ve been over it. It checks out.

05:14.407 --> 05:18.446
Well, no offense, blue eyes, but l’d like
a little more time with it myself.

05:18.607 --> 05:19.960
It checks out.

05:20.767 --> 05:22.086
She said it just came to her ?

05:22.247 --> 05:24.238
She was playing with her kid
and she got a notion.

05:24.407 --> 05:27.604
A notion. That is just beautiful.
She’s gonna love this.

05:27.767 --> 05:30.565
You didn’t tell her l’ve been trying
to prove something like this ?

05:30.727 --> 05:33.605
- Not exactly.
- Oh, good, because she would just--

05:34.007 --> 05:35.645
Wait a minute. Why not ?

05:36.447 --> 05:38.358
That’s part of the reason
l asked you here.

05:38.527 --> 05:40.119
She’s been cleared by the Pentagon...

05:40.287 --> 05:42.562
... but she refuses
to sign the confidentiality agreement.

05:42.727 --> 05:45.116
She says she wants nothing
to do with us.

05:45.287 --> 05:47.676
To be honest,
she’s been a bit of a pain in the ass.

05:48.607 --> 05:50.404
Forget her, then.
She’s made her choice.

05:50.567 --> 05:53.400
We’Il just have to figure out
how to implement it on our own.

05:53.567 --> 05:55.364
Let’s see.

05:55.767 --> 05:59.077
Now, upon first glance,
there are certainly some missing pieces...

05:59.247 --> 06:02.444
... that aren’t exactly spelled out
in the proof, but...

06:04.047 --> 06:05.036
What ?

06:05.207 --> 06:07.721
This would go a lot faster
if your sister were onboard.

06:07.887 --> 06:10.447
- She’s not gonna listen to me.
- You’re her brother.

06:10.607 --> 06:12.484
Exactly.

06:18.167 --> 06:20.556
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:22.167 --> 06:25.398
- Long time no see.
- To say the least.

06:28.527 --> 06:31.519
- Aren’t you going to invite me in ?
- Why are you here ?

06:31.727 --> 06:34.639
l can’t just stop by
and say hi to my little sister ?

06:34.807 --> 06:38.004
We haven’t spoken in four years.
You’ve never done anything like this.

06:38.167 --> 06:39.646
So, no, you can’t.

06:39.807 --> 06:43.004
l’ve been kind of busy with work,
doing a lot of traveling and such.

06:43.167 --> 06:46.079
And l was called back on business.
So l was in town...

06:46.247 --> 06:48.602
... and l thought l’d, you know...

06:48.767 --> 06:50.598
- Wait a second.
- What ?

06:50.767 --> 06:53.201
You’re not here
because of the physics proof, are you ?

06:53.367 --> 06:57.121
- No. That’s part of the reason l’m here--
- You work for the U.S. government ?

06:57.287 --> 06:59.517
No, l work for a multinational
oversight advisory that--

06:59.687 --> 07:02.440
You know what ? l don’t care.
l already told that colonel person...

07:02.607 --> 07:04.199
... l don’t want anything
to do with them.

07:04.367 --> 07:07.837
- Do you know what you’ve written ?
- A math proof. Some theoretical physics.

07:08.007 --> 07:10.726
l am willing to wager
it has no practical application at all.

07:10.887 --> 07:12.843
- l’Il take that action.
- What does that mean ?

07:13.007 --> 07:15.362
- Just sign the damn agreement.
- No.

07:15.527 --> 07:17.882
Getting all proprietary
about our research and ideas...

07:18.047 --> 07:19.958
... is everything that’s wrong
with science today.

07:20.127 --> 07:22.402
Did you know
that one-fifth of our genes...

07:22.567 --> 07:25.161
... the very building blocks of our being,
have been patented...

07:25.367 --> 07:27.722
... by major pharmaceutical corporations ?
One-fifth.

07:27.887 --> 07:29.957
If there’s any benefit at all
to what l’ve written...

07:30.127 --> 07:31.845
... it’s that it’Il spark an idea
in someone.

07:32.007 --> 07:35.682
l am not gonna sign away my rights,
least of all to the U.S. military.

07:35.887 --> 07:37.639
It has sparked an idea in someone,
a big one.

07:37.847 --> 07:39.121
- Like what ?
- No. Can’t tell you.

07:39.287 --> 07:41.960
- Not till you sign the agreement.
- l’m not signing till you tell me.

07:42.127 --> 07:44.516
- Is everything okay ?
- Look who showed up.

07:44.687 --> 07:45.881
Hey.

07:47.407 --> 07:49.125
It’s my brother.

07:50.287 --> 07:52.881
Right. Hey.

07:54.287 --> 07:55.959
Hi.

07:58.287 --> 08:00.562
- Hello, little one.
- Did you bring me a present ?

08:00.767 --> 08:03.804
- Madison.
- What ? No.

08:04.647 --> 08:06.763
- l didn’t know it was a rule.
- It is.

08:06.967 --> 08:08.958
Well, l guess l broke that rule.

08:09.167 --> 08:10.919
l made some dinner.
Would you care to join us ?

08:11.087 --> 08:12.122
Well, that’d be great.

08:12.327 --> 08:14.557
l’m starving. You have no idea
what time zone l came from.

08:14.727 --> 08:16.638
Well, l sure hope you like tofu chicken.

08:17.607 --> 08:20.883
l sure hope he’s kidding. Here you go.

08:24.807 --> 08:27.002
Not a fan of vegetarian cuisine, eh ?

08:27.167 --> 08:32.400
Yes, well, l suppose l was just
in the mood for, well, food.

08:32.567 --> 08:34.558
l’Il give Maddie her bath.
You two catch up.

08:34.727 --> 08:37.116
- Okay, hon.
- Hey, pop your head in before you leave.

08:37.327 --> 08:40.284
- What ? Why ?
- Children like to say goodbye.

08:40.447 --> 08:43.280
Oh, the-- Yeah. Sure. Sure.

08:46.887 --> 08:48.957
Boy, Madison’s sure grown, huh ?

08:49.767 --> 08:52.486
Since she was born ?
Yeah, yeah, she has.

08:53.207 --> 08:55.516
Okay, look, l don’t wanna waste
any more of your time.

08:55.687 --> 08:56.676
You need to come with me.

08:56.847 --> 08:59.998
Your proof could lead
to something groundbreaking.

09:01.247 --> 09:03.966
- How long would l be gone ?
- Well, like, a couple months, tops.

09:04.167 --> 09:06.362
A couple of months ?
Are you joking ? l--

09:06.527 --> 09:08.722
Madison has her first ballet recital
next Tuesday.

09:08.887 --> 09:11.082
She’s 4.
How good could she possibly be ?

09:11.247 --> 09:13.681
- That’s not the point.
- Hey, she’s not gonna remember.

09:13.887 --> 09:17.800
- l’Il remember me not being there.
- This is bigger than your responsibilities.

09:17.967 --> 09:20.117
Okay, we’ve had this conversation
before.

09:20.287 --> 09:22.596
You belittle my choices,
l get furious at you...

09:22.767 --> 09:26.157
... and we don’t talk for four years.
l’m not all that anxious to do that again.

09:26.367 --> 09:28.119
This is not what Dad
would have wanted.

09:28.567 --> 09:30.876
No, he would have wanted us
working together side by side...

09:31.047 --> 09:33.083
... toppling problems and sharing credit.

09:33.247 --> 09:34.999
Oh, you share credit now, do you ?

09:35.687 --> 09:38.884
This is important, Jeanie. It’s much more
important than you could ever imagine.

09:39.047 --> 09:40.685
For you, l am sure it is.

09:40.847 --> 09:44.317
But this, me being here,
this is important for me.

09:44.487 --> 09:46.000
Why can’t you accept that ?

09:47.127 --> 09:49.436
- You know, you leave me no choice.
- What ?

09:49.647 --> 09:51.000
- Give me your hand.
- Why ?

09:51.167 --> 09:55.080
Please just give me your hand.
Will you just. . ?

10:02.527 --> 10:07.601
- Okay, what the hell just happened ?
- It’s okay. You’re perfectly safe.

10:08.007 --> 10:09.326
l don’t feel perfectly safe.

10:09.487 --> 10:12.445
You’ve been teleported to an interstellar
vessel in orbit around the planet.

10:12.607 --> 10:16.077
Please. Teleportation is about as likely
as time travel.

10:18.047 --> 10:19.799
Yes, well...

10:29.207 --> 10:32.722
- Oh, my.
- Oh, yes.

10:34.247 --> 10:36.044
Is that. . ?

10:36.567 --> 10:37.886
Why aren’t we weightless ?

10:38.087 --> 10:41.363
Artificial gravity.
And, yes, that is North America...

10:41.567 --> 10:43.398
... and you are in geosynchronous orbit.

10:43.567 --> 10:45.478
We work for something
called the Stargate program.

10:45.647 --> 10:46.636
Stargate ?

10:46.807 --> 10:49.082
It’s a device that creates
stable artificial wormholes...

10:49.247 --> 10:53.320
... that allows us to travel between
other planets, even other galaxies.

10:53.487 --> 10:57.036
What have you gotten yourself
involved in here, Meredith ?

10:58.247 --> 11:00.283
- Meredith ?
- It’s a long story.

11:00.447 --> 11:03.883
- It’s his name.
- Your name is Meredith McKay ?

11:04.047 --> 11:06.641
It’s Meredith Rodney McKay, yes,
but l prefer to go by Rodney.

11:06.807 --> 11:08.877
Could we stick to the point here ?
Look out the window.

11:09.047 --> 11:12.164
- Much more interesting than my name.
- Your name is Meredith ?

11:12.327 --> 11:16.684
So this is, like, a spaceship ?

11:17.047 --> 11:19.959
<i>This is a U.S. Air Force vessel
called the Daedalus.</i>

11:20.127 --> 11:22.004
Your equation
has real-world applications...

11:22.167 --> 11:23.964
... l’m certain you’ve never
even considered.

11:24.127 --> 11:27.085
You see, there are some
very bad creatures out there...

11:27.287 --> 11:29.403
... that want nothing more
but to destroy this planet...

11:29.567 --> 11:31.205
... and everything that you hold dear.

11:31.887 --> 11:33.206
Did you say creatures ?

11:33.367 --> 11:36.359
- Like alien creatures ?
- Yes.

11:36.527 --> 11:40.406
Look, the work we could do is important,
Jeanie. It’s not just to you or me...

11:40.567 --> 11:44.082
... but to every living being down there.
And that includes Madison and...

11:44.247 --> 11:46.317
- Kaleb.
- Kaleb, yes.

11:46.487 --> 11:49.160
- We can’t do this without you.
- Let’s not go overboard.

11:49.327 --> 11:51.124
- l mean, she’d be an asset, but--
- McKay.

11:55.687 --> 11:57.962
So, what do you say, Mrs. Miller ?

11:58.847 --> 12:01.202
- Jeanie ?
- It’s just a lot to take in right now, okay ?

12:01.367 --> 12:02.686
Just give me a second, Mer.

12:09.607 --> 12:14.522
So somewhere down there, my husband
is giving my daughter a bath.

12:34.207 --> 12:36.084
You have to go.

12:38.127 --> 12:39.606
l know.

12:57.087 --> 12:58.884
- What did you tell Kaleb ?
- The truth.

12:59.047 --> 13:01.561
What ? Do you have any idea
what nondisclosure means ?

13:01.727 --> 13:04.446
Just because we don’t keep secrets
doesn’t mean we’re incapable of it.

13:04.607 --> 13:05.881
Well, what did he say ?

13:06.047 --> 13:09.084
He’s concerned that me telling him
will get him assassinated.

13:09.247 --> 13:13.001
- That-- That won’t happen, right ?
- Oh, probably not.

13:13.167 --> 13:15.920
<i>I’m sorry I couldn’t come with you,
but there’s too much going on here.</i>

13:16.087 --> 13:17.076
It’s fine.

13:17.247 --> 13:19.078
<i>I thought I could
help get Jeanie up to speed...</i>

13:19.247 --> 13:21.124
<i>... before you guys
are out of comm range.</i>

13:21.287 --> 13:24.279
<i>About a year ago, your brother came
across an abandoned alien experiment...</i>

13:24.447 --> 13:25.880
<i>... called Project Arcturus.</i>

13:26.047 --> 13:28.003
<i>It was an attempt
to generate zero-point energy.</i>

13:28.207 --> 13:30.402
That would be virtually limitless power.
What happened ?

13:30.567 --> 13:33.923
A slight problem. It was the creation of
exotic particles in the containment field.

13:34.087 --> 13:35.600
<i>He destroyed a solar system.</i>

13:35.767 --> 13:37.917
- Meredith.
- It was uninhabited.

13:38.087 --> 13:40.647
<i>Your brother, with others,
has been trying to figure out a way...</i>

13:40.847 --> 13:43.486
<i>... to draw zero-point energy
from a parallel space-time.</i>

13:43.647 --> 13:46.400
Which would get us around the creation
of dangerous exotic particles...

13:46.567 --> 13:47.556
... in our own space-time.

13:47.727 --> 13:49.683
And my theory
is about bridging universes.

13:49.847 --> 13:53.044
<i>Exactly. And we’re hoping
to use your proof as a theoretical basis...</i>

13:53.207 --> 13:56.005
<i>... for building a bridge
from a parallel space-time to ours.</i>

13:56.207 --> 13:58.641
The energy you’d need would
be enormous to the point of absurd.

13:58.807 --> 14:00.957
« Absurd » we can do.
We have a zero-point module...

14:01.167 --> 14:03.283
... which does what we’re attempting
on a smaller scale :

14:03.447 --> 14:05.244
Extract energy from subspace-time.

14:05.407 --> 14:08.126
<i>- So subspace is real ?
-You’re flying in it.</i>

14:10.567 --> 14:13.639
Aren’t you worried about the exotic
particles crossing back over my bridge ?

14:13.847 --> 14:15.121
<i>That’s the beauty of your theory.</i>

14:15.287 --> 14:17.118
<i>It should not only allow us
to build a bridge...</i>

14:17.287 --> 14:19.676
<i>... it should also allow us
to manage the flow rate of energy.</i>

14:19.887 --> 14:20.956
Like a faucet.

14:21.567 --> 14:23.956
<i>- Well, it’s something like that.
-It’s exactly like that.</i>

14:24.127 --> 14:25.560
What about the parallel universe ?

14:25.727 --> 14:28.799
Aren’t you just shifting
the exotic-particle problem to their side ?

14:29.007 --> 14:30.440
<i>Potentially. But when you consider...</i>

14:30.607 --> 14:33.485
<i>... that the number of possible
parallel universes that we could access...</i>

14:33.647 --> 14:35.126
<i>... borders on the infinite...</i>

14:35.287 --> 14:37.596
<i>... the odds of us choosing at random
one that’s inhabited...</i>

14:37.767 --> 14:39.280
<i>... are astronomically slim.</i>

14:41.607 --> 14:44.519
<i>I know, it’s an awful lot
to take in at once.</i>

14:44.687 --> 14:46.837
l solved your problem
in my spare time.

14:47.007 --> 14:48.759
- With finger-paints.
- Here we go.

14:48.927 --> 14:51.395
l just can’t imagine
how you’re surviving the humiliation.

14:51.567 --> 14:53.683
If it wasn’t for my work,
your theory would be useless.

14:53.887 --> 14:55.923
<i>Whoa, whoa, siblings, please.</i>

14:56.087 --> 14:57.725
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.086
What ?

15:01.847 --> 15:07.205
<i>Well, it’s just that you both said « sorry »
in that cute little Canadian way, and I--</i>

15:08.287 --> 15:12.838
<i>Sorry. Touch base when you get back
to Atlantis. Good luck.</i>

15:14.247 --> 15:17.319
These creatures must be quite the threat
for you to even try what you’re doing.

15:17.487 --> 15:19.921
Now, l don’t wanna scare you,
but you need to know the stakes.

15:20.087 --> 15:21.679
We’re at war.

15:21.847 --> 15:23.883
- Did you start it ?
- What ? No.

15:24.047 --> 15:25.321
- Come on.
- Well...

15:30.487 --> 15:33.365
You’ve got a nota bene by
the cosmological constant. Why is that ?

15:33.527 --> 15:34.926
Jeanie ?

15:36.647 --> 15:38.046
Hey.

15:39.167 --> 15:41.727
Yeah. Why you’re here, remember ?
Thank you.

15:41.887 --> 15:45.163
- So there’s your problem, right there.
- What are you talking about ? It’s here.

15:45.327 --> 15:46.806
- And you made a mistake.
- No, l didn’t.

15:46.967 --> 15:50.403
Okay, so we need a yea or nay
on the equations.

15:50.887 --> 15:52.684
Yea.

15:56.287 --> 15:58.403
<i>Atlantis already has
a containment chamber we can use.</i>

15:58.567 --> 16:00.922
<i>I’Il forward the necessary modifications
to zelenka.</i>

16:01.087 --> 16:03.396
<i>If he doesn’t mess it up,
he can make the changes we need...</i>

16:03.567 --> 16:04.920
<i>... before we even get there.</i>

16:21.087 --> 16:22.679
Ready ?

16:23.927 --> 16:25.679
Now, we’ve been through
these calculations...

16:25.847 --> 16:27.838
... and we’ve settled
on a containment-field setup...

16:28.007 --> 16:31.602
... that should work for us.
l just wanna show you these...

16:35.047 --> 16:39.040
Yes, we have it, people. Good work.
Good work, everybody.

16:39.727 --> 16:41.285
Just in time.

16:41.487 --> 16:44.240
- Has he talked about his sister with you ?
- Once or twice in passing.

16:44.407 --> 16:46.398
Usually like,
« Come on, even my sister can do it. »

16:46.567 --> 16:48.683
- You know, that type of thing.
- How’s it coming, Radek ?

16:48.847 --> 16:51.236
The simulations are in the green.
We’re ready to try power-up.

16:51.407 --> 16:54.365
- Just in time.
- That’s actually what l just said.

16:57.487 --> 17:00.684
Holy cow.
Now, that can’t be good for you.

17:00.847 --> 17:02.963
Nothing to worry about.
l’ve done it dozens of times.

17:04.446 --> 17:05.721
John Sheppard.

17:05.887 --> 17:07.525
Yeah. She’s married
and she’s my sister.

17:07.727 --> 17:10.116
- l’m just saying hi.
- Yeah, l know exactly what you’re doing.

17:10.287 --> 17:12.084
l’ve seen that look before, Kirk.

17:12.967 --> 17:15.925
Hello, Mrs. Miller. l’m Dr. Élizabeth Weir.
Welcome to Atlantis.

17:16.087 --> 17:17.805
Thank you.
Mer’s told me so much about you.

17:17.967 --> 17:19.877
All good, l s--

17:20.047 --> 17:22.560
- Did you just call him Mer ?
- It’s her pet name. Where are we ?

17:22.767 --> 17:25.041
Simulations are in the green.
We’re ready to try power-up.

17:25.207 --> 17:28.118
Really ? So soon ? That’s amazing.
Excellent work, Radek.

17:28.287 --> 17:30.517
- Thank you.
- Yes, we try not to encourage him.

17:30.687 --> 17:32.484
He’s got a bit of an ego.

17:40.407 --> 17:43.717
In-chamber conditions are green.

17:44.087 --> 17:46.647
Containment field is in the green.

17:46.807 --> 17:50.243
- Monitors are green.
- Everything’s green.

17:50.687 --> 17:55.317
- He likes to do the checklist.
- ZPM levels are well into the green.

17:55.487 --> 17:59.321
And backup terminals are green.

17:59.487 --> 18:01.682
We’re ready to initiate power-up.

18:01.847 --> 18:04.566
- Good luck.
- All right. Here we go.

18:05.767 --> 18:07.439
Want to turn it on together ?

18:08.327 --> 18:11.399
- Why would we do that ?
- Because it’s both of our work.

18:11.567 --> 18:13.444
There’s only room on the button
for one finger.

18:13.607 --> 18:15.837
- Well, then can l do it ?
- Yeah, but l’m right here, so--

18:16.007 --> 18:18.760
He likes to push the button.

18:18.927 --> 18:22.124
- Fine, go.
- Powering up to 5 percent.

18:28.927 --> 18:32.442
Containment field is holding.
Power generation is steady.

18:32.647 --> 18:35.400
- What about exotic particles ?
- Jeanie, please, l’m on it.

18:35.807 --> 18:39.038
We are holding at 5 percent.

18:39.207 --> 18:40.686
Good. Now what ?

18:40.847 --> 18:43.839
The safe thing to do is hold at 5 percent
for the next while.

18:44.047 --> 18:46.038
Yeah, she wasn’t talking to you.

18:46.207 --> 18:49.199
- It was an open question to the floor.
- Shared credit, huh ?

18:49.367 --> 18:51.119
We’Il do this together.
Dad will be so proud.

18:51.287 --> 18:54.677
- This is not the time or the place.
- Fine.

18:54.847 --> 18:57.600
- l’m going to my quarters.
- Yes. Well, good night. Thank you.

18:59.367 --> 19:00.402
So ?

19:00.567 --> 19:02.797
Well, obviously we hold at 5 percent
for the next while...

19:02.967 --> 19:05.845
... and see if any problems turn up.

19:06.007 --> 19:06.996
Right.

19:07.407 --> 19:09.841
l should probably
try to get some rest myself.

19:10.007 --> 19:11.599
Could you. . ?

19:32.047 --> 19:35.164
What the-- ? Shut it down.

19:37.687 --> 19:41.965
Foreign object. Go get Dr. Zelenka.

19:56.967 --> 19:58.798
It worked.

19:59.687 --> 20:01.803
- What are you doing ?
- Radek.

20:02.247 --> 20:03.396
Yes.

20:03.607 --> 20:06.485
l need to speak to whoever’s in charge
of this project.

20:07.287 --> 20:08.959
But that’s you.

20:10.607 --> 20:14.361
Well, then,
l guess l need to speak to me.

20:29.727 --> 20:32.446
- What is this ?
- Hey, Meredith.

20:33.047 --> 20:34.275
Oh, wonderful.

20:34.847 --> 20:36.599
John here was kind enough
to show me around...

20:36.767 --> 20:39.327
... offer me a warm meal, and introduce
me to some of your friends.

20:39.487 --> 20:42.206
- What have you told them ?
- We weren’t talking about you.

20:42.407 --> 20:45.240
- Oh, you weren’t ?
- No. We were discussing many things.

20:45.687 --> 20:48.963
Now, when the issue of bed-wetting
happened to come up...

20:49.127 --> 20:51.482
... she may have mentioned something
about your childhood.

20:51.647 --> 20:52.716
That is not true.

20:52.927 --> 20:55.395
- Relax. We all have embarrassing stories.
- Of course we do.

20:55.567 --> 20:58.957
One time, the school bullies made me eat
lunch with my underwear on my head.

20:59.127 --> 21:00.845
Oh, wait, that was you.

21:04.447 --> 21:08.201
- And this is revenge for what, exactly ?
- You don’t even know, do you ?

21:08.407 --> 21:11.717
<i>Colonel Sheppard and Dr. mcKay
to the Isolation Room immediately.</i>

21:11.927 --> 21:13.679
Isolation Room ?

21:13.887 --> 21:15.320
Come on.

21:26.447 --> 21:28.961
- What in the world ?
- That’s you.

21:29.127 --> 21:32.324
No, that is a live closed-circuit feed...

21:32.487 --> 21:36.765
... of a man we have
in the Isolation Room.

21:43.767 --> 21:44.995
What ?

21:45.167 --> 21:48.921
He appeared in the containment chamber
in some sort of force field.

21:49.087 --> 21:52.921
- What do you mean, he appeared ?
- Out of thin air.

21:53.087 --> 21:55.760
l have Zelenka working on it.
Obviously we shut down the project.

21:55.927 --> 21:57.724
Well, how did he get in there ?

21:57.887 --> 22:00.606
He claims to be from
a parallel universe.

22:00.767 --> 22:02.678
You said the odds against this
were astronomical.

22:02.847 --> 22:04.519
- You saw the math.
- Well, we got it wrong.

22:04.727 --> 22:06.797
He’s here now, so the question is,
what does he want ?

22:07.007 --> 22:08.838
To talk to you.

22:10.247 --> 22:13.319
All right, you want shared credit ?
You’re coming in with me.

22:25.527 --> 22:28.439
Now, l figured you’d be here,
but Jeanie ?

22:28.607 --> 22:30.962
l always hoped we’d work together
in Atlantis.

22:31.767 --> 22:33.166
Well, this is a first.

22:33.327 --> 22:34.555
- For me too.
- For me too.

22:34.727 --> 22:38.402
Have a seat.
Now, l presume you go by--

22:38.567 --> 22:40.159
Rodney.

22:40.767 --> 22:41.802
Rod.

22:41.967 --> 22:44.242
l could never get anyone
to call me that.

22:44.407 --> 22:46.477
Okay, l’m gonna make
some assumptions...

22:46.647 --> 22:48.046
... based on what l’ve seen here...

22:48.207 --> 22:51.085
... and from readings we’ve taken
in my own space-time.

22:51.247 --> 22:52.919
Please stop me if l’m wrong. One :

22:53.087 --> 22:55.043
l presume you’re running
some sort of experiment...

22:55.207 --> 22:57.562
... that’s designed to bridge
between parallel universes ?

22:58.007 --> 23:01.602
And, two, it has something to do
with power generation.

23:01.767 --> 23:04.076
- Warm ? Cold ?
- Hot.

23:04.247 --> 23:06.966
Well, l’m sure the experiment’s
been a success on this side...

23:07.127 --> 23:09.960
... but it’s having some rather serious
repercussions in my universe.

23:10.127 --> 23:12.595
- l told you.
- Not now.

23:12.767 --> 23:15.361
Dangerous particles that don’t belong
in either of our universes...

23:15.527 --> 23:17.677
... are being created
on your side of the bridge.

23:18.487 --> 23:20.762
So you knew this could happen ?

23:21.607 --> 23:24.201
It was a slight risk, yes.

23:24.407 --> 23:26.523
<i>- This is weird.
-Well, you’re quite correct, Jeanie.</i>

23:26.687 --> 23:29.485
<i>Because these particles don’t behave
according to any laws of physics...</i>

23:29.647 --> 23:31.126
<i>... in our space-time...</i>

23:31.287 --> 23:33.721
... they’re creating a tear
in the fabric of our universe.

23:34.407 --> 23:38.764
- First a solar system, now a universe.
- Yes. How exactly did you get here ?

23:40.087 --> 23:44.000
Well, we detected the anomaly about
20 hours ago in space above the planet.

23:44.207 --> 23:46.482
We maneuvered one of our Jumpers
in close...

23:46.647 --> 23:49.684
... and tried to broadcast a signal
to whoever was on the other side.

23:49.847 --> 23:52.964
We would be unable to detect that signal
from within the containment chamber.

23:53.127 --> 23:56.244
So Sheppard and l came up with a plan
to beam a person into the anomaly.

23:56.687 --> 23:59.759
They would be protected by an Ancient
personal force field that we discovered.

24:00.647 --> 24:01.682
l depleted ours.

24:02.367 --> 24:04.164
Still, it was an incredible risk.

24:05.007 --> 24:06.804
Well, it was Sheppard’s idea.

24:07.007 --> 24:08.520
<i>We decided it might allow one of us...</i>

24:08.687 --> 24:11.201
<i>... to cross the bridge
and bring the problem to your attention.</i>

24:11.367 --> 24:14.723
There was very little time
and, well, there seemed no other way.

24:14.887 --> 24:17.117
- We drew straws.
- You lost.

24:17.327 --> 24:20.842
No. l won. What, the prospect
of saving an entire universe ?

24:21.047 --> 24:22.719
No, it was-- No-brainer.

24:23.367 --> 24:24.482
Oh, sure.

24:25.567 --> 24:28.286
l can’t begin to say how sorry we are.

24:28.487 --> 24:31.445
Yes, well, you could start
by shutting down the experiment ?

24:31.647 --> 24:33.763
Already done. And after hearing
what you’ve told me...

24:33.927 --> 24:35.440
... l see no reason
why we’d start it up.

24:35.607 --> 24:40.601
Great. Then my work here is done.
Mission accomplished.

24:46.887 --> 24:51.597
Well, yes, but how did you plan
on getting, you know, back ?

24:51.767 --> 24:52.882
l mean, to your own universe.

24:54.127 --> 24:56.561
The matter bridge you created
is unidirectional.

24:57.527 --> 25:01.361
- But that means--
- Yes. Yes, it does.

25:06.527 --> 25:08.882
So, Jeanie, you have three kids
in this universe ?

25:09.047 --> 25:10.560
No, just the one.

25:10.727 --> 25:14.037
Well, l’m sure you’re as great a mother
in this space-time as you are in mine.

25:14.887 --> 25:15.922
This’Il blow your mind.

25:16.087 --> 25:20.285
l have photographs of your alternate life.
Wanna see the kids you haven’t had yet ?

25:20.487 --> 25:22.796
Absolutely. Oh, look at Maddie.

25:22.967 --> 25:25.083
- Who’s that ?
- That’s Bradley and Robbie.

25:25.247 --> 25:26.566
All right, what’s the game plan ?

25:26.727 --> 25:29.480
Put him up in the guest quarters
till we can find something permanent.

25:29.647 --> 25:31.478
Something more permanent ?
We’re not keeping him.

25:31.647 --> 25:33.877
- He can’t go back.
- That doesn’t mean he has to stay here.

25:34.047 --> 25:37.403
- He’d rather be on Atlantis than Earth.
- l see. So he gets his way and l don’t.

25:37.567 --> 25:39.398
How can you not wanna be with him ?
He’s you.

25:39.567 --> 25:41.683
He’s not me. l’m me, the real me.

25:41.847 --> 25:45.237
l suppose it’s all relative. To Rod,
his reality is every bit as valid as ours.

25:45.407 --> 25:47.557
To him, we’re the impostors.

25:47.727 --> 25:49.365
What does Élizabeth have to say
about this ?

25:49.527 --> 25:50.801
Two McKays are better than one.

25:50.967 --> 25:54.960
There aren’t two McKays.
There’s one McKay and him.

25:55.127 --> 25:56.685
Whatever you say...

25:56.847 --> 25:58.565
... Meredith.

26:12.567 --> 26:16.196
Nice shot. Easily 275.

26:16.367 --> 26:19.564
You know, l’ve been meaning
to put up buoy markers...

26:19.727 --> 26:21.604
... but who has the time, huh ?

26:21.807 --> 26:24.241
This is great. We don’t have
one of these where l’m from.

26:24.407 --> 26:27.001
Besides, you’d need to take a cattle prod
to the Sheppard l know...

26:27.167 --> 26:28.964
... to get him up this early.

26:29.127 --> 26:30.480
Late nights partying, huh ?

26:32.487 --> 26:33.840
If you could call it that.

26:34.007 --> 26:36.601
He’s very active with the Mensa club
we have there.

26:37.127 --> 26:39.163
They have a lot of functions.

26:39.327 --> 26:42.876
Well, can’t blame a man
for his intelligence.

26:43.087 --> 26:46.204
No, but l can blame him
for reminding me all the time.

26:47.047 --> 26:48.878
- He doesn’t.
- Trust me.

26:49.087 --> 26:52.477
My Sheppard makes your Rodney
seem modest in comparison.

26:54.407 --> 26:58.525
Well, l got to admit,
between you and me...

26:58.687 --> 27:00.837
... you’re a lot different
than our Rodney too.

27:01.247 --> 27:02.316
How so ?

27:03.167 --> 27:05.078
It’s the little things.

27:05.247 --> 27:09.638
You like golf.
You say please and thank you. You’re...

27:09.847 --> 27:11.439
What’s the opposite
of condescending ?

27:20.167 --> 27:22.920
Now, l can help you with that hook.

27:32.167 --> 27:35.239
- What the hell is this ?
- Hey, sleepyhead.

27:35.407 --> 27:37.238
- Yeah, hi.
- l had a breakfast date with Jeanie.

27:37.407 --> 27:40.797
l guess it ballooned into a group affair.
Sit down. We’re tracing back our lives...

27:40.967 --> 27:42.844
... trying to find differences
between our pasts.

27:43.007 --> 27:45.157
Rod is an honorary member
of the Athosian Council.

27:45.327 --> 27:46.999
And is godfather to his niece
and nephews.

27:47.207 --> 27:49.596
- Yes, well, how wonderful for him.
- Well, it’s easier for me.

27:49.767 --> 27:52.804
Our Earth has a ZPM too, so it makes
the back-and-forth a lot simpler.

27:53.007 --> 27:55.282
<i>Doctors mcKay, please report
to the containment chamber.</i>

27:55.447 --> 27:56.800
<i>Doctors mcKay.</i>

27:56.967 --> 27:58.400
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

27:58.567 --> 28:03.004
- Hey, Rod, are we still on to spar later ?
- Absolutely.

28:07.967 --> 28:09.366
What do you mean you started it up ?

28:09.527 --> 28:12.758
Shutting the experiment down only
made things worse for us, not better.

28:12.967 --> 28:16.403
The matter bridge is still active,
but we are not drawing any power...

28:16.607 --> 28:18.916
... creating pressure like a dam.

28:19.127 --> 28:22.642
If we didn’t turn it on, it could have
resulted in a catastrophic overload.

28:22.807 --> 28:25.719
- We should have thought of that.
- Don’t look at me.

28:25.887 --> 28:28.082
You’re willing to take the credit
but none of the blame ?

28:28.247 --> 28:29.600
l never wanted all the credit.

28:29.767 --> 28:31.837
- Oh, no one is blaming you.
- Oh, really ?

28:32.047 --> 28:34.402
Look, this is just a temporary solution.

28:34.607 --> 28:37.883
The Zelenka in my space-time estimates
that there is at least a week and a half...

28:38.047 --> 28:40.163
... before the tear expands
as far as the city.

28:40.327 --> 28:43.637
- My city.
- What’Il happen when it does ?

28:43.807 --> 28:46.765
Imagine what would happen if you threw
the laws of physics out the window.

28:47.167 --> 28:48.839
Entropy. Chaos.

28:49.007 --> 28:52.283
Worst-case scenario, the entropy
expands as far as the subspace layers...

28:52.447 --> 28:53.562
... underneath our space-time.

28:53.727 --> 28:57.606
It could travel instantaneously. Your
universe could flash out of existence.

28:57.807 --> 29:00.196
We need to mend that tear
before it becomes irreparable.

29:00.367 --> 29:02.642
l have some thoughts.
Is there a place we could go to work ?

29:02.847 --> 29:04.644
Oh, yes, of course. Follow me.

29:05.527 --> 29:08.963
- Jeanie, we could use your help.
- Thank you.

29:10.967 --> 29:12.798
Do you mind running up
these power requirements ?

29:12.967 --> 29:14.366
Done.

29:17.767 --> 29:19.519
What were you doing
having breakfast with him ?

29:19.687 --> 29:21.518
l don’t often meet people
from another universe.

29:21.687 --> 29:23.325
l found myself curiously interested.

29:23.487 --> 29:25.603
Well, l don’t want you hanging around
with him anymore.

29:25.767 --> 29:28.156
- What ?
- Look, l am your real brother.

29:28.367 --> 29:30.676
- In what sense ?
- Oh, what is that supposed to mean ?

29:30.887 --> 29:33.117
You haven’t been a brother to me
since l quit school.

29:33.287 --> 29:35.437
You were making an incredible mistake.
l was trying--

29:35.647 --> 29:39.435
You were trying to control my life, Mer.
l disagreed with you. l still do.

29:39.607 --> 29:41.598
What, because of that,
you stopped being my brother ?

29:41.767 --> 29:45.077
- l never stopped being your brother.
- We haven’t talked in four years.

29:45.887 --> 29:47.843
- Don’t put that all on me.
- It is all on you.

29:48.047 --> 29:49.366
l had no way of getting in touch.

29:49.567 --> 29:53.355
l was doing top-secret research
in another galaxy.

29:53.527 --> 29:54.880
You could have sent me a message.

29:55.047 --> 29:57.720
You know, call me on my birthday,
at Christmas.

29:57.887 --> 29:59.764
Once a year,
that’s all l would have needed.

29:59.927 --> 30:04.079
Just a,« ou » ?Hi. How are you ?
Are you happy ? Are you okay ? »

30:04.247 --> 30:06.317
That would have been enough,
but you didn’t do that.

30:06.527 --> 30:10.805
l was wrong and you were right.
So, what, l was not worth talking to ?

30:11.407 --> 30:12.965
It wasn’t like that at all.

30:13.127 --> 30:14.480
You don’t like me talking to Rod...

30:14.647 --> 30:17.957
... because it makes you realize
how bad a brother you’ve really been.

30:18.207 --> 30:20.516
Hey, you guys got something
over there ?

30:21.927 --> 30:25.237
No. We don’t.

30:29.327 --> 30:30.919
- He’s slowing me down.
- Really ?

30:31.087 --> 30:32.964
l thought two of you
would have sped things up.

30:33.167 --> 30:34.316
Yeah, he’s not me.

30:34.487 --> 30:36.079
l know he’s not the same person,
trust me.

30:36.247 --> 30:38.078
Just saying he’s a genius too,
isn’t he ?

30:38.247 --> 30:40.124
- Unless he’s lying.
- About what ?

30:40.287 --> 30:43.484
What if the people on his Atlantis were
sick of him messing up all the time, huh ?

30:43.647 --> 30:46.764
So when it came time to send
some stooge to another universe...

30:46.927 --> 30:48.758
... there was only one guy
they could do without.

30:48.927 --> 30:50.679
Say what you want.
l know what this is about.

30:50.847 --> 30:51.836
Oh, really ?

30:52.007 --> 30:54.760
Mr. Mensa-ln-a-Parallel-Universe,
what is this all about ?

30:54.927 --> 30:56.565
You think Jeanie likes him
more than you.

30:56.767 --> 31:00.521
What ? That’s crazy. That’s-- That’s--

31:01.047 --> 31:03.003
That’s possibly true.

31:05.087 --> 31:06.406
Jeanie and l drifted apart.

31:06.567 --> 31:08.523
l mean, that happens.
It wasn’t done maliciously.

31:08.687 --> 31:11.281
Do l have regrets ? Yes, of course l do.
But who doesn’t ? l mean--

31:11.447 --> 31:14.519
You know, l’m not very good at saying
l’m sorry or that l’m wrong...

31:14.687 --> 31:17.884
... you know, possibly because
it happens so rarely.

31:18.607 --> 31:19.801
So l didn’t call or write.

31:19.967 --> 31:23.403
And when l realized that four years
has gone by, it was just a...

31:24.687 --> 31:27.759
You’re right. Of course, you’re right.

31:28.527 --> 31:30.006
She has every reason to hate me.

31:30.407 --> 31:32.682
- l didn’t say she hates you.
- Yeah, well, she should.

31:33.687 --> 31:35.518
- Well, if you insist.
- Yeah, l do.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.365
Fine. Fair enough.

31:37.527 --> 31:41.361
<i>Dr. mcKay to the containment chamber.
Dr. mcKay.</i>

31:41.727 --> 31:43.843
Good talk. Thanks.

31:49.687 --> 31:51.439
- Great, he’s here.
- What’s going on ?

31:51.607 --> 31:54.679
l set up a way to pick up transmissions
inside the containment chamber...

31:54.847 --> 31:56.485
... should Rod’s universe
try to contact us.

31:56.647 --> 31:59.719
We, of course, still have no way
of communicating with them, but--

31:59.887 --> 32:01.161
- They sent us a message.
- Yeah.

32:01.327 --> 32:02.726
Their exotic-particle problem...

32:02.887 --> 32:05.447
... is spinning out of control much faster
than they’d anticipated.

32:05.607 --> 32:07.757
- Oh, boy.
- But they have a solution.

32:07.927 --> 32:10.043
- They do ? That’s great.
- Well, not really.

32:10.207 --> 32:12.084
Their solution
will not only destroy Atlantis...

32:12.247 --> 32:16.001
... but tear a hole
in the fabric of this universe.

32:16.567 --> 32:18.558
Oh, boy.

32:23.927 --> 32:27.556
Now, l’m not saying that their attempt
would be successful, but if it was...

32:27.727 --> 32:30.161
... it would flood the exotic particles
created on their side...

32:30.327 --> 32:32.318
... into this space-time all at once.

32:32.487 --> 32:34.523
- And that would--
- Be bad.

32:34.687 --> 32:36.962
- Right. l got that, but--
- How bad ?

32:37.167 --> 32:39.556
Well, to be honest, the science
gets extremely complicated...

32:39.727 --> 32:41.399
... but simply put...

32:41.567 --> 32:45.196
... the tear will eventually swallow up
the entire galaxy, possibly the universe.

32:45.367 --> 32:46.686
So...

32:46.847 --> 32:47.836
... very bad.

32:48.007 --> 32:49.838
l think we can all agree that
that would be bad.

32:50.007 --> 32:51.963
Their plan will take six hours
to implement.

32:52.167 --> 32:53.919
l suggest we do something
before that.

32:54.127 --> 32:56.687
- Well, we have an idea.
- Actually, Jeanie has an idea.

32:57.687 --> 33:01.600
We think we can collapse the bridge with
a massive burst of energy from this side.

33:02.207 --> 33:06.246
And stop the creation of exotic particles
on the other side by doing so.

33:06.447 --> 33:09.996
- How massive a burst are we talking ?
- Everything we’ve got.

33:10.167 --> 33:12.601
l mean, enough to severely deplete
our ZPM.

33:12.767 --> 33:15.759
So instead of creating
a new powerful energy source...

33:15.927 --> 33:18.157
... we’Il be sacrificing the one
we already have.

33:18.367 --> 33:21.723
Yes. We’d still be able to dial Earth,
but much less frequently, of course.

33:21.887 --> 33:24.959
And let’s just say, l wouldn’t wanna
be around here if the Wraith show up.

33:29.487 --> 33:31.762
l don’t see that we have a choice.

33:33.727 --> 33:35.797
All right. Do it.

33:37.447 --> 33:38.766
Dr. Weir gave the okay for this ?

33:38.927 --> 33:41.487
You’d rather the universe
was destroyed ?

33:41.647 --> 33:44.684
- Not really.
- Rodney, can l talk to you for a second ?

33:48.727 --> 33:50.957
<i>Look, the Daedalus is still in orbit.
l thought--</i>

33:51.127 --> 33:52.560
l know what you’re gonna say.

33:52.727 --> 33:56.197
If l can beam into the energy stream,
protected by my personal force field--

33:56.367 --> 33:58.562
You’d be transported
back to your own universe. l know.

33:58.727 --> 34:00.877
l didn’t bring it up because,
if it doesn’t work--

34:01.047 --> 34:03.197
Well, l’m willing to take that risk.

34:03.607 --> 34:06.041
<i>l’ve already requested the Daedalus
to execute the transport...</i>

34:06.207 --> 34:08.960
... to the coordinates inside the chamber
on your mark.

34:09.127 --> 34:11.004
That is, if you’re willing to do this.

34:11.887 --> 34:13.081
Everyone loves you here.

34:14.367 --> 34:15.719
Yeah, but it’s not home.

34:15.887 --> 34:18.275
Look, what,
my Sheppard is a know-it-all...

34:18.447 --> 34:22.042
... my Teyla is hard to talk to,
and my Ronon is--

34:22.206 --> 34:24.243
Well, actually,
those two are pretty similar.

34:25.726 --> 34:29.481
l guess what l’m trying to say is that,
for all their faults...

34:29.647 --> 34:32.922
... they’re my team.
My place is with them.

34:33.127 --> 34:35.402
Besides, they’re not looking
for another McKay around here.

34:35.567 --> 34:37.842
- They already have one.
- It’s just a lesser model.

34:38.687 --> 34:39.880
l envy you.

34:40.087 --> 34:42.806
You say exactly what’s on your mind
no matter how it makes you look.

34:43.007 --> 34:46.362
l can only imagine the freedom you must
have not caring if people like you or not.

34:46.806 --> 34:51.437
- What, people don’t like me ?
- Trust me, you’ve got it great here.

34:51.647 --> 34:53.638
Now, l’ve made some calculations.

34:53.806 --> 34:55.797
When the readings reach the levels
l’ve indicated...

34:55.967 --> 34:57.878
... you’Il know whether or not
l made it home.

34:59.127 --> 35:02.881
Well, l guess you just need
to click your heels together, huh ?

35:03.207 --> 35:04.959
Good luck, Rodney.

35:05.567 --> 35:07.364
Yeah, you too.

35:08.807 --> 35:10.399
Radek.

35:14.247 --> 35:16.044
Jeanie.

35:25.247 --> 35:27.556
- You’re letting him do this ?
- l tried to talk him out of it.

35:27.727 --> 35:29.718
But you know Rod.

35:29.887 --> 35:31.559
Hermiod, ready when you are.

35:32.607 --> 35:36.805
l guess there’s nothing left to say
but there’s no place like home.

35:40.287 --> 35:43.836
All right, all in the green.
Ready for forced power output.

35:44.007 --> 35:46.362
Right. Then...

35:49.047 --> 35:51.163
You wanna press the button ?

35:51.327 --> 35:54.285
Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

35:59.607 --> 36:01.438
Power is at full.

36:01.607 --> 36:03.404
It’s working.

36:04.727 --> 36:06.957
Hermiod, this is McKay.
Commence transport.

36:07.687 --> 36:08.915
Transport is complete.

36:09.127 --> 36:11.880
- The bridge is beginning to destabilize.
- It’s not yet enough.

36:12.087 --> 36:14.521
- ZPM’s at 50 percent.
- It’s still not enough, Rodney.

36:14.727 --> 36:16.922
- We have to max it out.
- Thirty percent.

36:18.647 --> 36:20.319
The bridge is collapsing.
We’ve done it.

36:20.527 --> 36:22.199
- Okay, we can shut it down now.
- Not yet.

36:22.407 --> 36:25.240
According to these readings, if we
shut it down now, he won’t make it.

36:25.447 --> 36:26.721
Give it a few more seconds.

36:27.727 --> 36:30.560
- ZPM’s at 5 percent.
- Almost there.

36:30.727 --> 36:32.001
Cut power now.

36:33.167 --> 36:36.443
How much power did you drain
from the ZPM ?

36:41.087 --> 36:42.679
All of it.

36:43.127 --> 36:45.595
l drained all of it.

36:46.167 --> 36:47.236
You did the right thing.

36:49.007 --> 36:51.441
Well, l suppose l would’ve done
the same thing for...

36:51.607 --> 36:53.199
... me.

36:56.447 --> 36:58.802
l am so fired.

37:00.327 --> 37:03.080
<i>Jeanie, it’s your brother, Rodney.</i>

37:03.247 --> 37:05.238
<i>I wanna say...</i>

37:06.647 --> 37:09.115
<i>... family is important.</i>

37:09.287 --> 37:11.278
<i>I’ve come to realize that
because the people here...</i>

37:11.447 --> 37:15.122
<i>... have become a sort of
a kind of surrogate family to me.</i>

37:15.287 --> 37:16.402
<i>I know what you’re thinking.</i>

37:16.567 --> 37:18.876
<i>I’ve never been the poster child
for that kind of sentiment.</i>

37:19.047 --> 37:22.323
<i>But when one’s contemplating
one’s own demise...</i>

37:22.487 --> 37:26.002
<i>... one tends to see things
more clearly.</i>

37:27.487 --> 37:32.197
<i>I really do wish you the best, you know ?
And I’m sorry we weren’t closer.</i>

37:32.367 --> 37:33.880
<i>Perhaps...</i>

37:36.207 --> 37:39.244
<i>... if, by chance, I make it out of this,
perhaps one day we can be.</i>

37:39.407 --> 37:41.284
<i>And I would like that.</i>

37:42.127 --> 37:44.846
<i>Now, if there’s time, I’d like to--</i>

37:45.567 --> 37:46.886
When did he record this ?

37:47.047 --> 37:51.404
Couple years back when we thought
the bad guys were gonna get us.

37:52.927 --> 37:54.440
Now l’ve seen three sides
of my brother.

37:54.607 --> 37:56.245
Yeah.

37:57.007 --> 37:59.282
What are you two up to ?

38:00.287 --> 38:03.120
Nothing. Just telling stories about you.

38:03.287 --> 38:05.721
You know,
trying to help her fall asleep.

38:07.247 --> 38:09.363
l’Il leave you guys alone.

38:17.247 --> 38:19.886
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:20.047 --> 38:23.164
<i>Hey, you should be packing.
Daedalus leaves in the morning.</i>

38:24.687 --> 38:27.360
l’m done. How’d it go with Weir ?

38:28.807 --> 38:31.446
Well, she wasn’t too happy
about the whole killing the ZPM...

38:31.607 --> 38:33.757
... but, you know,
in the grand scheme of things...

38:33.927 --> 38:35.838
... we did prevent the destruction
of the universe.

38:36.007 --> 38:37.520
So, you know, not fired.

38:37.727 --> 38:40.400
- That’s good.
- Yeah.

38:42.047 --> 38:44.925
Oh, right. Got this for Madison.

38:47.447 --> 38:49.836
Yeah. Swiped it from Weir’s desk.

38:50.887 --> 38:53.481
Well, it’s not like there’s a Toys R Us
nearby, so...

38:53.647 --> 38:56.445
Well, it’s the thought that counts,
l guess.

38:59.087 --> 39:03.126
- Well, l’d say,« ou » ?See you around, » but...
- Yes.

39:03.287 --> 39:04.959
About that.

39:07.887 --> 39:09.923
Which is to say...

39:10.607 --> 39:14.805
Look, what l wanted to...

39:17.167 --> 39:19.203
Thank you for trying.

39:30.847 --> 39:34.556
How are you ? You happy ? You okay ?

39:34.727 --> 39:37.605
Yeah, Mer. l am.

39:37.767 --> 39:39.405
l really am.

39:45.047 --> 39:47.038
Intergalactic Gate Network
should be completed soon.

39:47.207 --> 39:48.720
So...

39:48.887 --> 39:50.479
... maybe it won’t be four years
next time ?

39:50.647 --> 39:52.239
Does this mean
l’Il see you at Christmas ?

39:52.447 --> 39:56.281
If you can convince Kaleb
not to make Tofurkey.

39:57.607 --> 39:59.484
No promises.

40:16.967 --> 40:19.276
Am l just not getting
the team e-mails anymore ?

40:19.447 --> 40:21.085
Take it easy.
We’re just talking about Rod.

40:21.287 --> 40:23.881
- Oh, yes, well, of course you are.
- Do you think he made it back ?

40:24.047 --> 40:26.641
Well, it’s hard to say, really,
but l doubt he’Il be back, though.

40:26.807 --> 40:30.720
- Good. We found him a little creepy.
- What ?

40:30.887 --> 40:32.718
l can’t stand people
who are nice all the time.

40:32.887 --> 40:34.923
Makes me feel like
they’re trying to hide something.

40:35.087 --> 40:36.759
- Really ?
- He kept trying to correct me...

40:36.927 --> 40:40.715
... on my Athosian history.
It grew tiresome very quickly.

40:41.487 --> 40:42.886
Why, well, he wasn’t that bad.

40:43.047 --> 40:45.197
Yeah, well, let’s be honest.
Rod was annoying.

40:45.367 --> 40:49.679
Well, l’Il be honest with you.
That’s kind of nice to hear.

40:50.167 --> 40:51.646
Now...

40:52.767 --> 40:54.280
... what else has been happening ?

40:54.447 --> 40:57.644
Well, Teyla’s got the hots
for one of the new Marines.

40:57.807 --> 40:59.798
- That is not true.
- You know it is.

40:59.967 --> 41:02.117
Hardly new either.
