00:01.302 --> 00:02.770
REBECCA: Previously
 on Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...

00:02.803 --> 00:04.272
What you said,
about believing in me,

00:04.305 --> 00:06.707
about truly understanding
 who I am...

00:06.740 --> 00:07.608
No one has ever

00:07.641 --> 00:09.543
said anything
 like that about me.

00:09.577 --> 00:10.711
That means so much.

00:10.744 --> 00:13.347
You have no idea.

00:13.381 --> 00:15.149
A kiss on the cheek means

00:15.183 --> 00:16.650
everything.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.152
You and Josh,
 your love story?

00:18.186 --> 00:19.787
It gives me hope.

00:19.820 --> 00:21.322
My marriage is like

00:21.355 --> 00:22.690
The Walking Dead, okay?

00:22.723 --> 00:24.658
We are all just trying
to get out alive.

00:25.359 --> 00:29.497
*

00:29.530 --> 00:32.400
So Paula came home
a couple weeks ago--

00:32.433 --> 00:35.803
I remember she was
all dressed up--

00:35.836 --> 00:38.706
and said she was
unhappy, uh...

00:40.808 --> 00:41.775
Dude...

00:41.809 --> 00:42.743
Sorry, man.

00:42.776 --> 00:44.178
My aim's really
off today.

00:49.583 --> 00:51.385
Please continue, Scott.

00:51.419 --> 00:53.354
I thought maybe we
should talk to someone.

00:53.387 --> 00:54.722
Uh, but not a shrink.

00:54.755 --> 00:56.490
We're from Buffalo.

00:56.524 --> 00:58.426
We don't like
the touchy-feely stuff.

00:58.459 --> 00:59.860
And you, Paula?

00:59.893 --> 01:02.130
You still feeling unhappy?

01:02.163 --> 01:04.298
Look, Scott and I
understand each other.

01:04.331 --> 01:05.433
And that's enough.

01:05.465 --> 01:06.767
So I-I don't want
to rock the boat.

01:06.800 --> 01:09.570
You know, we rock the boat
and then we'll just...

01:09.603 --> 01:11.705
we'll flip the whole thing.

01:11.739 --> 01:13.607
Paula, if you don't deal
with your unhappiness,

01:13.641 --> 01:15.776
problems only grow.

01:15.809 --> 01:16.744
At that point,

01:16.777 --> 01:18.212
forget about flipping the boat,

01:18.246 --> 01:19.680
you're putting a hole
right in the boat.

01:19.713 --> 01:21.782
That's classic self-sabotage.

01:21.815 --> 01:23.717
Babe, we're sinking.

01:23.751 --> 01:25.753
Let's do whatever he says.

01:25.786 --> 01:27.688
What should we do, Mr. Brah?

01:27.721 --> 01:30.124
Please, Mr. Brah was my father.

01:30.158 --> 01:31.692
I'm Father Brah.

01:31.725 --> 01:34.162
And I'm just going to give you
some simple homework.

01:34.195 --> 01:35.563
Go home.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.531
Have dinner, alone,

01:37.565 --> 01:38.732
just the two of you.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.268
Look into
each other's eyes

01:40.301 --> 01:42.303
and really connect
with each other.

01:42.336 --> 01:43.637
Can you do that?

01:43.671 --> 01:45.306
For me?

01:45.339 --> 01:47.208
And for God?

01:47.241 --> 01:48.376
Wow, you do that?

01:48.409 --> 01:49.710
You pull the God card that easy?

01:49.743 --> 01:50.744
I'm a priest, Paula.

01:50.778 --> 01:52.580
What other cards
you think I got?

01:52.613 --> 01:54.882
Scott, Paula...

01:54.915 --> 01:57.551
be the boat, not the hole.

01:57.585 --> 01:59.620
Nobody likes a hole.

02:00.888 --> 02:02.623
Everybody likes a swoosh!

02:05.326 --> 02:08.229
It's really off today.

02:08.262 --> 02:10.231
What up, God?

02:10.264 --> 02:11.899
*

02:13.967 --> 02:16.170
(whistling a tune)

02:21.809 --> 02:23.677
Yo.

02:23.711 --> 02:26.347
Yo. Cool.

02:26.380 --> 02:29.783
Um... haven't
seen you in a while.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.352
Yeah...

02:31.385 --> 02:33.887
I've been avoiding you.

02:33.921 --> 02:35.756
Okay. By dating
my next-door neighbor

02:35.789 --> 02:37.358
and then showing up at my door?

02:37.391 --> 02:39.460
Heather said
you had something for her?

02:39.493 --> 02:41.195
Oh, yeah, uh,
she's borrowing my hard drive

02:41.229 --> 02:42.630
for her coding class.
I'll get it.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.732
Good.

02:46.667 --> 02:47.901
Looks nice in here.

02:47.935 --> 02:49.637
You decorated.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.839
Some succulents, some candles,
you hung the fish...

02:53.474 --> 02:56.710
So, you and Heather.

02:56.744 --> 02:58.712
Yeah...

02:58.746 --> 03:00.848
That's still a thang?

03:00.881 --> 03:03.817
Yeah, it's a bit of a "thang."

03:03.851 --> 03:05.353
Good, good.

03:05.386 --> 03:07.255
I'm very glad that you found
a mating partner.

03:08.822 --> 03:10.691
Why do you care
about my "mating" choices?

03:10.724 --> 03:12.893
I don't. I don't care!

03:12.926 --> 03:13.927
And I think I've shown that
consistently.

03:13.961 --> 03:15.363
Here you go. Here's the...

03:15.396 --> 03:16.430
here's the hard drive.

03:16.464 --> 03:17.798
Oh, and, uh, tell Heather

03:17.831 --> 03:18.999
not to open the folder
that says "Taxes."

03:19.032 --> 03:20.568
If she's looking for porn,

03:20.601 --> 03:21.869
there's a folder
that says "Porn."

03:21.902 --> 03:23.804
Got it. Lovely.

03:23.837 --> 03:25.406
Yeah.
Thank you so much.

03:25.439 --> 03:26.874
They're the good kind,
with plots.

03:26.907 --> 03:29.643
That's why the hard drive
is so big.

03:29.677 --> 03:31.379
He's not listening.

03:31.412 --> 03:32.846
*

03:34.948 --> 03:36.917
All right, brosefs,
here's the deal.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.486
I got a big presentation
coming up,

03:38.519 --> 03:39.920
and I am dragging,
so I'm gonna get

03:39.953 --> 03:41.722
a triple redeye
with an extra shot

03:41.755 --> 03:43.391
in the Olson Twin Size.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.832
"The plaintiff
in the case is entitled

03:51.865 --> 03:54.702
"to collect back rent on
the property and in addition,

03:54.735 --> 03:58.005
"the defendant is liable for
court costs and interest accrued

03:58.038 --> 04:00.774
in the period of June 2013."

04:00.808 --> 04:03.911
"Also, the plaintiff wants
a back massage and a smoothie."

04:03.944 --> 04:05.313
(laughs)

04:05.346 --> 04:06.914
(both laughing)

04:06.947 --> 04:08.816
Oh, my God, you're so funny!

04:08.849 --> 04:10.584
I love you...

04:10.618 --> 04:11.852
your... sense of humor!

04:11.885 --> 04:13.654
(laughs)
Oh, so...

04:13.687 --> 04:14.955
how are you?

04:14.988 --> 04:16.524
Good. I, uh...

04:16.557 --> 04:17.858
you know, I keep
thinking about camp

04:17.891 --> 04:19.860
and just how much fun we had.

04:19.892 --> 04:21.394
Yeah, me too.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.531
That campfire was so nice.
Yeah.

04:23.564 --> 04:25.699
Yeah.

04:27.535 --> 04:28.469
Oh, wow.

04:28.502 --> 04:30.404
Uh, so do you have, like, a...

04:30.438 --> 04:31.405
a "recital" today?

04:31.439 --> 04:33.006
Nah, just regular class.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.408
Hey, do you know
what time it is?

04:34.442 --> 04:36.009
Yeah. Uh, let's see...

04:36.043 --> 04:38.712
It is 3:08.
Thanks.

04:38.746 --> 04:40.047
I left my phone at home.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.483
I feel so... naked.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.618
Like buck naked.

04:44.652 --> 04:46.720
Mmm.

04:46.754 --> 04:48.055
Well, um, I gotta go.

04:48.088 --> 04:48.956
Oh. Bye!
Sorry, but...

04:48.989 --> 04:50.458
Yeah, bye.

04:50.491 --> 04:52.893
It was good seeing you.

04:52.926 --> 04:54.828
Bye.

04:54.862 --> 04:55.963
Bye.
Bye.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.940
(sighs)

05:08.075 --> 05:09.477
REBECCA:
 This case is about

05:09.510 --> 05:11.479
taking responsibility
 for one's actions.

05:11.512 --> 05:14.615
About following
through on a promise

05:14.648 --> 05:15.983
regardless of the consequences.

05:16.016 --> 05:17.751
And therefore,
the defendant must do

05:17.785 --> 05:19.620
what the law requires

05:19.653 --> 05:22.790
and must assume all fiduciary
responsibilities in this matter.

05:22.823 --> 05:23.791
Okay.

05:23.824 --> 05:24.992
Well-argued, Miss Bunch.

05:25.025 --> 05:25.926
Over to you, Miss Cavanaugh.

05:25.959 --> 05:29.062
Your Honor, my argument today

05:29.096 --> 05:30.731
centers on three
essential principles

05:30.764 --> 05:32.966
contained in the municipal
real estate code--

05:33.000 --> 05:35.068
the same three codes
that my client upheld

05:35.102 --> 05:39.006
in regards to the property
in question,

05:39.039 --> 05:40.508
533 East Cameron.

05:40.541 --> 05:41.542
The written agreement

05:41.575 --> 05:42.543
between my client

05:42.576 --> 05:43.611
and the plaintiff

05:43.644 --> 05:45.012
stipulates that
the lease payment

05:45.045 --> 05:46.714
is due by the fifth
of every month.

05:46.747 --> 05:48.649
Section F, line 37.

05:48.682 --> 05:52.553
And any day beyond
the fifth, a fee of $3,500

05:52.586 --> 05:54.388
will incur... Section F,

05:54.422 --> 05:55.756
line 39.

05:55.789 --> 05:58.025
My client has
followed protocol

05:58.058 --> 05:59.993
and issued numerous
written and verbal warnings

06:00.027 --> 06:02.062
to procure
the delinquent monies,

06:02.095 --> 06:04.097
specifying failure
of payment

06:04.131 --> 06:05.766
would result in immediate

06:05.799 --> 06:07.468
termination of
the property lease,

06:07.501 --> 06:09.102
adhering to
the formalities

06:09.136 --> 06:11.004
outlined in
Section G, line four.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.874
The recent lease termination
by my client

06:13.907 --> 06:16.677
makes the plaintiff
and his employees squatters.

06:16.710 --> 06:17.878
These charges
should be dropped immediately

06:17.911 --> 06:20.047
and stricken
from the court records.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.515
So you see,

06:21.549 --> 06:22.916
Your Honor, the, uh...

06:22.950 --> 06:24.084
the conclusion is clear.

06:24.117 --> 06:26.720
All right. Strong argument.

06:26.754 --> 06:28.489
What's your response,
Miss Bunch?

06:36.497 --> 06:37.097
Miss Bunch?

06:37.130 --> 06:38.466
You didn't get it?

06:38.499 --> 06:39.600
What?

06:39.633 --> 06:42.102
I'm sorry, I-I have to, um...

06:42.135 --> 06:43.671
I have to examine
just a piece of

06:43.704 --> 06:45.539
essential evidence.

06:45.573 --> 06:46.840
This'll only... take a second.

06:50.511 --> 06:52.513
(dramatic, rumbling percussion)

07:00.754 --> 07:02.022
(distorted):
No...

07:02.055 --> 07:04.692
(distorted):
Miss Bunch?

07:04.725 --> 07:08.562
(distorted):
Rebecca, what's wrong?

07:13.233 --> 07:15.202
Miss Bunch?

07:15.235 --> 07:18.939
(gasps)

07:18.972 --> 07:20.974
(distorted):
Mother....

07:29.683 --> 07:30.851
Um... what's wrong?

07:30.884 --> 07:32.452
Is everything okay, Miss Bunch?

07:33.921 --> 07:35.222
Your Honor...

07:35.255 --> 07:36.657
(clears throat)

07:36.690 --> 07:38.225
I'd like to request
a temporary stay

07:38.258 --> 07:39.226
in this matter.

07:39.259 --> 07:40.828
What?

07:40.861 --> 07:42.630
Uh, it is an emergency.

07:42.663 --> 07:44.665
Your Honor,
this is highly unprofessional.

07:44.698 --> 07:45.799
Uh, yeah.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.234
Okay, cookie,
you don't have to lie.

07:47.267 --> 07:48.802
These are good people.

07:48.836 --> 07:50.904
I-I've known Harry forever,
I-I mentored Connie.

07:50.938 --> 07:51.805
They're gonna understand.

07:51.839 --> 07:52.806
What?
Understand what?

07:52.840 --> 07:54.107
You guys, look at this.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.509
She just accidentally texted

07:55.543 --> 07:57.077
her ex-boyfriend
from summer camp

07:57.110 --> 07:58.546
who she's secretly
in love with,

07:58.579 --> 08:00.047
moved here for...

08:00.080 --> 08:02.149
Oh, and by the way, has
a serious live-in girlfriend.

08:02.182 --> 08:04.051
Paula! What...

08:04.084 --> 08:05.152
Oh, my God.

08:05.185 --> 08:06.720
What is this about?

08:09.022 --> 08:12.159
Look, Miss Bunch,
I can't grant you a stay.

08:14.194 --> 08:16.830
You gotta take care of this
right away.

08:16.864 --> 08:18.131
You take the rest
of the day off.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.167
Yes, what can
we do to help?

08:20.200 --> 08:21.535
Check this out, Connie.

08:22.570 --> 08:23.537
Oh.

08:23.571 --> 08:25.072
Oh, this is a disaster.

08:25.105 --> 08:26.073
What are you gonna do?

08:26.106 --> 08:27.007
Forget this stupid case,

08:27.040 --> 08:28.709
we've gotta figure out
how to spin this.

08:28.742 --> 08:30.243
VANESSA:
No, let me see that.

08:30.277 --> 08:32.111
Girl, this is
a living nightmare!

08:32.145 --> 08:33.080
JUDGE SPENSER: What if
we spin it as a joke?

08:33.113 --> 08:34.081
Oh, ha, ha, ha,

08:34.114 --> 08:35.182
it's opposite day.

08:35.215 --> 08:38.284
No one does opposite day
anymore, Harry, what are we?

08:38.318 --> 08:39.919
Fourth graders in 1995?

08:39.953 --> 08:41.989
Well, I don't know!
I'm panicking!

08:42.022 --> 08:44.157
And I'm the only one
brainstorming here, Connie!

08:44.191 --> 08:45.626
Maybe she blames
the phone company.

08:45.659 --> 08:47.595
I know!
She could say she got hacked.

08:47.628 --> 08:50.664
No. No, there's only
one option here.

08:50.698 --> 08:52.566
Witness protection.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.202
Burn it all down.
Start a new life.
Oh, my... come on!

08:55.235 --> 08:56.870
Okay, all right.
Everybody just calm down.

08:56.904 --> 08:59.139
We just have to get to his phone
before he sees it.

08:59.172 --> 09:01.842
Ugh, but he's on the thing
all the time. Dammit!

09:01.875 --> 09:03.577
Wait! Oh, my God!

09:03.611 --> 09:04.678
Guys, I just
remembered something!

09:04.712 --> 09:05.979
He doesn't have
his phone with him.

09:06.013 --> 09:07.180
Yeah, he accidentally
left it at home

09:07.214 --> 09:08.348
while he's at Tae Kwan Do.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.717
Tae Kwan Duh!

09:09.750 --> 09:10.651
That is your answer, girl!

09:10.684 --> 09:12.586
PAULA: You have got to get
to that apartment.

09:12.620 --> 09:13.921
Wait! What if Velveeta is there?

09:13.954 --> 09:15.255
His girlfriend.

09:15.288 --> 09:16.256
REBECCA:
No, no. No.

09:16.289 --> 09:17.625
Valencia's not there.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.326
She teaches yoga
back-to-back today,

09:19.359 --> 09:21.094
so I have a window of,
like, three hours.

09:21.128 --> 09:22.630
So the first thing we do
when we get to Josh's house

09:22.663 --> 09:24.598
is we look for his spare key.

09:24.632 --> 09:26.199
He got locked out
one time and...

09:26.233 --> 09:27.635
I can't go with you.

09:27.668 --> 09:28.201
What?

09:28.235 --> 09:30.003
Yeah, I know!

09:30.037 --> 09:31.939
I'm having dinner
with Scott at home.

09:31.972 --> 09:32.606
What?

09:32.640 --> 09:33.841
I'm sorry.

09:33.874 --> 09:34.908
But it is a big deal.

09:34.942 --> 09:36.143
It's like our whole marriage

09:36.176 --> 09:39.379
is in a boat and
God is watching or something.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.681
But you go!

09:40.714 --> 09:42.950
Go to his apartment right now!

09:42.983 --> 09:45.152
CONNIE:
Yes! Go as fast as your tiny
little legs will carry you!

09:45.185 --> 09:47.254
Go!
I'll get you a police escort!

09:47.287 --> 09:49.056
Come on!
Just go, go, go!

09:49.089 --> 09:51.358
(siren wailing,
rock song begins)

09:57.898 --> 09:59.733
* Time is running out

09:59.767 --> 10:01.869
* You've got to act now

10:01.902 --> 10:03.637
* Stay one step ahead

10:03.671 --> 10:06.239
* Of that moronic text somehow

10:06.273 --> 10:08.208
* There's no turning back

10:08.241 --> 10:10.210
* Here in the danger zone

10:10.243 --> 10:13.313
* You've got to manually
delete that text *

10:13.346 --> 10:15.983
* From that dude's
cell phone... *

10:16.016 --> 10:17.250
Thank you, officers!

10:17.284 --> 10:18.251
OFFICER:
Good luck, Rebecca!

10:18.285 --> 10:21.354
* It's a text-mergency

10:21.388 --> 10:24.357
* Baby can't you see

10:24.391 --> 10:25.893
* Text-mergency

10:25.926 --> 10:27.661
* That term
just occurred to me *

10:27.695 --> 10:30.263
* It's gonna
catch on instantly *

10:30.297 --> 10:32.065
Wait, what about...

10:32.099 --> 10:33.667
* Text-tastrophe

10:33.701 --> 10:36.436
* That sounds better to me

10:36.469 --> 10:38.305
* Text-tastrophe

10:38.338 --> 10:40.007
* That could really
spread virally *

10:40.040 --> 10:42.175
* I prefer text-mergency!

10:42.209 --> 10:44.912
*

10:52.119 --> 10:54.755
* I accidentally texted
my mother-in-law *

10:54.788 --> 10:57.090
* A picture of my erection

10:57.124 --> 10:59.092
* I once group-texted
my whole staff *

10:59.126 --> 11:01.428
* About my yeast infection

11:01.461 --> 11:03.263
* Exactly, it's so relatable

11:03.296 --> 11:06.366
* That's why I coined
the phrase... *

11:06.399 --> 11:08.001
* Text-tastrophe

11:08.035 --> 11:11.004
* That's the meme,
don't you agree? *

11:11.038 --> 11:13.173
All due respect.

11:13.206 --> 11:17.845
* Text-mergency is
the better term, Miss C. *

11:17.878 --> 11:19.847
Um, I want to go with...

11:19.880 --> 11:21.481
* Text-tastrophe

11:21.514 --> 11:24.752
* I already put it
on Urban Dictionary... *

11:24.785 --> 11:26.486
(elevator bell dings)

11:26.519 --> 11:30.357
You fools, it doesn't matter
what it's called.

11:30.390 --> 11:33.026
That's right, it's me,
the ghost of Steve Jobs.

11:33.060 --> 11:36.029
What matters is that I control
your lives from the grave.

11:36.063 --> 11:39.032
Technology is slowly alienating
everyone from their loved ones.

11:39.066 --> 11:40.167
(laughs)

11:40.200 --> 11:42.502
And when you send a few words
to the wrong recipient

11:42.535 --> 11:44.371
and it immediately destroys
your entire life,

11:44.404 --> 11:45.372
that's called a...

11:45.405 --> 11:47.474
* Message-pocalypse

11:47.507 --> 11:49.409
* Get out of here, Steve Jobs!

11:52.179 --> 11:54.481
Guys, what about
that lawyer chick?

11:54.514 --> 11:56.316
We've gotten really off track.

11:56.349 --> 11:59.152
JUDGE SPENCER: * She's searching
for the spare key *

11:59.186 --> 12:00.387
* Look under the mat!

12:02.489 --> 12:05.225
* It's clearly hidden
in that owl! *

12:07.160 --> 12:09.396
* Look in that
flower pot, hurry... *

12:11.799 --> 12:14.434
* Hurry up and check
that Buddha sconce... *

12:16.136 --> 12:20.373
* Check the Buddha sconce,
check the Buddha sconce! *

12:21.474 --> 12:22.375
(key jingles)

12:22.409 --> 12:23.977
Yes!

12:24.011 --> 12:25.312
* She did it

12:25.345 --> 12:27.147
* Now she can delete the text

12:27.180 --> 12:31.051
* She won't need
to come up with a... *

12:31.084 --> 12:32.452
* Text-scuse

12:32.485 --> 12:34.321
* Text-planation.

12:35.488 --> 12:37.324
Text-mergency just flows.

12:37.357 --> 12:38.992
No, dude, text-tastrophe.

12:39.026 --> 12:40.327
It's what it is.
Dude, she's
totally right.

12:40.360 --> 12:41.494
(scoffs)
Text-scuse me?

12:46.066 --> 12:49.369
(humming)

12:49.402 --> 12:51.071
Okay.

12:54.074 --> 12:55.375
Passcode, shoot.

12:55.408 --> 12:57.044
Uh... uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

12:57.077 --> 12:58.378
Jesus's birthday?

12:58.411 --> 13:00.380
12-25, no.

13:00.413 --> 13:02.582
Uh, last four of social?

13:02.615 --> 13:04.584
3-1-2-4, no.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.119
Valencia's birthday?

13:06.153 --> 13:08.521
Let's see, it's 5-5... 5-5-8-8.

13:08.555 --> 13:10.523
Yes! Oh, God,
he really loves her.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.392
Okay.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.527
Text messages.

13:14.561 --> 13:17.597
"Rebecca Bunch,"
ooh, that's a bad one.

13:17.630 --> 13:20.467
(sighs, chuckles)

13:20.500 --> 13:22.502
(sighs)

13:28.575 --> 13:30.577
(laughs with relief)

13:32.880 --> 13:34.882
*

13:38.085 --> 13:40.053
VANESSA:
* Don't smell the shirt

13:40.087 --> 13:43.223
* You're running out of time.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.594
All right.

13:58.005 --> 14:00.874
(sighs, chuckles)

14:04.211 --> 14:07.180
Honey, you heard
what Father Brah said.

14:07.214 --> 14:09.049
We need to really connect.

14:09.082 --> 14:10.283
Put the phone away.

14:10.317 --> 14:12.285
You're right.

14:12.319 --> 14:14.287
You're absolutely right.

14:14.321 --> 14:18.225
Okay, let's do this,
let's... connect.

14:22.029 --> 14:24.364
*

14:35.342 --> 14:37.344
(sighs)

14:37.377 --> 14:39.312
You blinked. I win. (laughs)

14:39.346 --> 14:40.948
I-I don't think that's what
we're supposed to be doing.

14:40.981 --> 14:42.549
I don't know what we're
supposed to be doing.

14:42.582 --> 14:45.218
Maybe we should hold hands.

14:45.252 --> 14:47.287
Okay.

14:50.323 --> 14:52.325
*

14:55.428 --> 14:56.930
You know, mine is really good.

14:56.964 --> 14:57.965
Do you want to try it?

14:57.998 --> 14:59.366
Sure.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.268
Uh, okay.

15:14.714 --> 15:16.316
(grunts)

15:21.321 --> 15:23.290
Mmm.

15:23.323 --> 15:24.291
This is nice.

15:24.324 --> 15:25.325
Yep.

15:27.327 --> 15:29.029
Josh.

15:29.062 --> 15:31.064
What are you...?

15:31.098 --> 15:33.266
Oh... my God,
thank God you're back.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.135
What's going on?

15:35.168 --> 15:36.436
Uh, how did you get in here?

15:36.469 --> 15:38.705
How does anyone get in anywhere?

15:38.738 --> 15:41.241
It's like we're there,
and then we're here.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.642
Aah, God.

15:42.675 --> 15:44.211
What?

15:44.244 --> 15:47.080
Okay, slow down,
slow down, slow down.

15:47.114 --> 15:48.281
Just slow down.

15:48.315 --> 15:53.320
Okay, uh, give me a second
to just get my story straight.

15:53.353 --> 15:54.687
Did you break in?

15:54.721 --> 15:56.689
(snaps)
Break-in, yes,
there was a break-in.

15:56.723 --> 15:59.292
But not here,
not here, never here.

15:59.326 --> 16:01.161
What?
Okay.

16:01.194 --> 16:03.696
So I was in my, uh, apartment,

16:03.730 --> 16:06.366
and, uh, somebody did
the thing that you...

16:06.399 --> 16:07.734
you were just saying, the thing
that you were just saying.

16:07.767 --> 16:09.302
They broke in?
Yes.

16:09.336 --> 16:11.171
Yes, you're so good.
We should have a charades night.

16:11.204 --> 16:12.272
Okay, Rebecca...
I haven't seen anyone
since the beach.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.774
Rebecca, wait, wait, someone
broke into your house?

16:14.807 --> 16:18.711
Yes, yes, they broke in,
and, um, they-they smashed it,

16:18.745 --> 16:21.248
uh, with a big...

16:21.281 --> 16:22.315
Rock.
Yes.

16:22.349 --> 16:23.316
You're so good at this.

16:23.350 --> 16:24.317
We should do teams of two.

16:24.351 --> 16:25.318
When are you next free?

16:25.352 --> 16:26.319
Wait, wait,
Rebecca, Rebecca.

16:26.353 --> 16:27.487
Just hold
yourself together.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.289
Did you call the police?

16:29.322 --> 16:30.757
No, no, no cops.

16:30.790 --> 16:32.459
No, didn't call the police.

16:32.492 --> 16:33.426
So why are you here?

16:33.460 --> 16:35.195
Slow down!

16:35.228 --> 16:36.229
Okay, so after
I couldn't reach you,

16:36.263 --> 16:37.464
I came here to be with you
and your girlfriend.

16:37.497 --> 16:38.465
All right, all right, all right.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.400
So take a deep breath.
Okay.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.735
I'm gonna say this
as slowly as possible.

16:42.769 --> 16:43.736
Okay.

16:43.770 --> 16:46.773
Okay, so someone used a rock

16:46.806 --> 16:51.444
and broke into your apartment?

16:51.478 --> 16:53.313
Was-was anything taken?

16:53.346 --> 16:55.348
No. No, just the rock
through the window.

16:55.382 --> 16:57.484
So I was scared,
and I came here,

16:57.517 --> 17:00.353
and the door was unlocked.

17:00.387 --> 17:01.621
Oh, man.

17:01.654 --> 17:03.723
I mean, you know,
I do that sometimes.

17:03.756 --> 17:06.326
(scoffs) Did I leave
the fridge open, too?

17:06.358 --> 17:10.063
Yes, you did, and I closed it,
and I saved a lot of cold cuts.

17:10.097 --> 17:12.398
Geez. Uh, you know what,
thank you.

17:12.432 --> 17:15.734
L-Look, okay,
you're really upset.

17:15.768 --> 17:18.271
Yeah, I-I am really upset.

17:18.305 --> 17:20.740
You know what, I'm probably...
I'm probably overreacting.

17:20.772 --> 17:23.276
It's not a big deal.
I'm gonna get out of your hair.

17:25.744 --> 17:26.779
Wait.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.715
Yeah?

17:29.716 --> 17:32.385
I don't feel okay about this.

17:32.419 --> 17:33.853
You don't?

17:33.886 --> 17:35.388
Of course not.

17:35.422 --> 17:36.389
Look at you.

17:36.423 --> 17:39.459
I can't send you home alone.

17:39.492 --> 17:40.627
Look how scared you are.

17:42.662 --> 17:45.332
You look like a tiny
scared little bird.

17:45.365 --> 17:46.799
(baby voice):
I do?

17:46.833 --> 17:48.535
(chuckles)

17:48.568 --> 17:50.870
Josh, I, um...

17:50.903 --> 17:53.540
I'm so sorry that I just
came in your house.

17:53.573 --> 17:54.874
No. No, it's okay,
you were scared.

17:54.907 --> 17:57.877
Look, why don't we go
back to your place,

17:57.910 --> 17:59.479
and I'll make sure
it's all okay.

17:59.512 --> 18:02.482
Thank you, Josh.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.351
I'm not scared anymore.

18:04.384 --> 18:06.419
And we'll get that broken
window fixed, right?

18:06.453 --> 18:09.422
Mmm, broken window.

18:09.456 --> 18:11.558
Broken window.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.560
Yes...

18:13.593 --> 18:14.661
Yes.

18:14.694 --> 18:16.429
Cool, let me just change.

18:16.463 --> 18:18.565
Great, and, hey, shower
if you're feeling it.

18:18.598 --> 18:19.566
No rush.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.801
It's really... really no rush.

18:21.834 --> 18:23.303
(door closes)

18:23.336 --> 18:26.573
God, Paula, I hope
your marriage is fixed by now.

18:28.675 --> 18:30.177
(groans)

18:30.210 --> 18:32.179
Ugh, just push it through.

18:32.212 --> 18:33.513
No, no, we can save
the cork.

18:33.546 --> 18:34.547
No, we can't.

18:34.581 --> 18:35.682
Be realistic, okay?

18:35.715 --> 18:37.550
We just got to push
the cork through

18:37.584 --> 18:40.553
and drink the wine with dirty
little pieces of cork in it.

18:40.587 --> 18:42.855
Is it great?
No, but that's life.

18:44.424 --> 18:45.525
(cell phone rings)

18:45.558 --> 18:47.394
I am not going to answer that.

18:47.427 --> 18:49.662
Nope.

18:49.696 --> 18:52.699
I just hope it doesn't have
something to do with the kids.

18:52.732 --> 18:54.834
They're upstairs.

18:54.867 --> 18:56.836
That's right.

18:56.869 --> 18:59.539
And you know how much trouble
they can get into upstairs.

18:59.572 --> 19:02.775
I'm just gonna check,
just for peace of mind.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.446
Oh, it's my mom.

19:06.479 --> 19:07.447
Something must be wrong.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.449
It's so late up in Buffalo.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.784
Her-her gout must be
bothering her.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.320
Mom, everything okay?

19:13.353 --> 19:14.621
Joints flaring up?

19:14.654 --> 19:17.624
Hi. So, okay, Josh caught me
coming in his house,

19:17.657 --> 19:19.492
and I started panicking,

19:19.526 --> 19:20.827
and I told him that
we'd be good at charades,

19:20.860 --> 19:22.362
and now he's being all
protective and masculine--

19:22.395 --> 19:23.496
he smells like karate,
and I love it--

19:23.530 --> 19:25.198
and he's getting dressed now,

19:25.232 --> 19:27.200
so what I need you to do is
I need you to go to my house,

19:27.234 --> 19:28.668
stop what you're doing,
and throw a rock

19:28.701 --> 19:30.570
through my sliding
glass door right now, okay?

19:32.539 --> 19:33.640
Copy that.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.975
Did you say "copy that"
to your mom?

19:36.008 --> 19:39.979
Yes, I have to make copies
for her health insurance.

19:40.012 --> 19:42.382
Okay, yeah, that's enough.

19:42.415 --> 19:43.883
Who calls you all the time?

19:43.916 --> 19:44.884
You think I haven't noticed?

19:44.917 --> 19:46.553
What's really going on?

19:46.586 --> 19:47.620
I don't have time
for this, Scott, okay?

19:47.654 --> 19:48.688
I got to go.

19:48.721 --> 19:49.889
I'll be back in
an hour, tops.

19:49.922 --> 19:51.891
It's the peewee football coach,
isn't it?

19:51.924 --> 19:53.560
I see him coming back
for seconds

19:53.593 --> 19:55.328
when you bring
the orange slices.

19:55.362 --> 19:56.663
Oh, my God, no.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.265
Scott, uh, look, I have to go.

19:58.298 --> 20:00.600
Paula, if you walk
out that door without me,

20:00.633 --> 20:03.270
you're rocking the boat
in the bad way. Big time.

20:03.303 --> 20:04.737
Ugh, fine.

20:04.771 --> 20:06.273
Come with me then, okay?

20:06.306 --> 20:09.742
But you... you cannot
ask any questions, okay?

20:09.776 --> 20:11.778
*

20:14.781 --> 20:17.750
All right, let's go clean up
some broken glass.

20:17.784 --> 20:20.887
Hey, uh, first, can I just
get a glass of water?

20:20.920 --> 20:22.355
Uh, sure.
Thanks.

20:22.389 --> 20:24.757
And, uh, a toast
with almond butter?

20:24.791 --> 20:28.695
And a sliced apple cut
into very tiny slices.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.430
*

20:37.604 --> 20:39.038
(Scott groaning)

20:39.071 --> 20:41.040
I know I'm not supposed
to ask any questions,

20:41.073 --> 20:42.909
but can I ask what
you're looking for?

20:42.942 --> 20:44.911
Yeah, I need a rock,
like, a nice-sized one.

20:44.944 --> 20:45.912
Can I help you look?

20:45.945 --> 20:48.047
Uh, okay sure.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.616
I mean, uh, if you want to.

20:49.649 --> 20:50.617
Awesome.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.619
(groans)

20:52.652 --> 20:53.953
First I got to
use the bathroom.

20:53.986 --> 20:55.021
You know how my body
deals with excitement.

20:55.054 --> 20:56.889
Okay, use the sliding glass
door, it's always open.

20:56.923 --> 20:57.890
But hurry up, okay?

20:57.924 --> 20:59.592
Be right back.

21:02.462 --> 21:03.930
(cell phone chimes)

21:05.832 --> 21:08.368
Oh, God, I just need a rock.

21:08.401 --> 21:09.469
I hate Southern California!

21:09.502 --> 21:11.738
No rocks, no dirt, no sticks!

21:11.771 --> 21:13.373
(huffing)

21:13.406 --> 21:15.408
Paula, look.

21:15.442 --> 21:16.509
(gasps)

21:16.543 --> 21:18.077
Oh, my God, babe,
it's beautiful.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.679
It's textbook.

21:19.712 --> 21:20.813
It's like the image you get

21:20.847 --> 21:22.415
when you Google the word "rock."

21:22.449 --> 21:24.050
(chuckles)
Now what do we do?

21:24.083 --> 21:25.385
Go, go, go, go, go!

21:25.418 --> 21:26.319
Go, go!

21:26.353 --> 21:27.687
Go, go, go, go, go!

21:27.720 --> 21:29.356
Chuck it!

21:29.389 --> 21:30.222
What?

21:30.256 --> 21:31.524
Scott, throw it
through the window.

21:31.558 --> 21:32.759
I can't throw it--

21:32.792 --> 21:33.960
Scott, the boat is sinking.

21:33.993 --> 21:35.762
Throw the rock
through the widow!
(shouts)

21:39.899 --> 21:42.369
(dogs barking)

21:42.402 --> 21:43.703
(laughs)
(whoops)

21:43.736 --> 21:44.971
I can't believe
we did that.

21:45.004 --> 21:46.973
Uh, what else can we break?

21:47.006 --> 21:48.541
Oh, I still got to pee!

21:48.575 --> 21:50.910
(both laughing)

21:53.480 --> 21:55.448
So, I just want to let you
know I was thinking about it

21:55.482 --> 21:57.450
in the car and what if the
bad guys felt really bad

21:57.484 --> 21:58.685
about what they'd done
and-and they and they went

21:58.718 --> 22:00.720
and cleaned it up, 'cause I've
heard about that happening.

22:00.753 --> 22:03.423
Oh, my gosh, that's--

22:03.456 --> 22:04.424
I shouldn't be surprised,

22:04.457 --> 22:05.525
because that's
the way I left it.

22:05.558 --> 22:06.659
Yeah, that's broken glass.

22:06.693 --> 22:07.694
That's a lot of broken glass.

22:07.727 --> 22:09.429
Yeah, that's a legitimate...

22:09.462 --> 22:10.563
Wow.
It's a legitimate mess.

22:10.597 --> 22:12.365
Well, I mean,
this is really creepy.

22:12.399 --> 22:13.833
But at least you're not hurt.

22:13.866 --> 22:15.134
That's the
most important thing.

22:15.167 --> 22:17.136
Is it?

22:17.169 --> 22:17.970
Of course!

22:18.004 --> 22:20.039
You can always
replace a door, but,

22:20.072 --> 22:21.741
you know,
there's only one Becks.

22:23.175 --> 22:26.513
Oh, well, there's
only one Josh Chan.

22:26.546 --> 22:28.147
Actually, there's a lot
of Josh Chans.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.449
There's one in Azusa.

22:29.482 --> 22:31.384
Yeah, I used to play him
in soccer.

22:31.418 --> 22:32.419
(both chuckle)

22:32.452 --> 22:33.886
Wow, um,

22:33.920 --> 22:35.522
I feel

22:35.555 --> 22:37.390
really rattled.

22:37.424 --> 22:38.525
I need some wine.

22:38.558 --> 22:39.426
Do you want some wine?

22:39.459 --> 22:40.593
You know what? Sure.

22:40.627 --> 22:41.894
Let's do it.
Great.

22:41.928 --> 22:43.530
Uh, oh, can I have ice in mine?

22:43.563 --> 22:45.632
Yeah, okay, iced wine.

22:45.665 --> 22:47.567
Coming up.

22:47.600 --> 22:50.136
And then we'll
clean up some glass.

22:50.169 --> 22:51.404
Okay.

22:51.438 --> 22:52.171
Oh, yeah, here you go.

22:52.204 --> 22:53.473
Let me get that.

22:53.506 --> 22:55.708
Oh, thank you.

22:55.742 --> 22:57.076
Hey, um,

22:57.109 --> 22:59.178
I feel really safe
with you here.

22:59.211 --> 23:00.413
Thank you.

23:00.447 --> 23:01.681
(scoffs) Of course.

23:01.714 --> 23:03.182
It's the least I can do.

23:03.215 --> 23:06.419
Thank you.

23:06.453 --> 23:07.820
Hey.

23:07.854 --> 23:09.055
You know,
I'm thinking out loud.

23:09.088 --> 23:11.057
As-as long as
we're having wine--

23:11.090 --> 23:13.493
Oh, cheers, by the way. Eyes.

23:13.526 --> 23:14.594
There we go.

23:14.627 --> 23:15.828
Um, I'm pretty hungry.

23:15.862 --> 23:17.129
Do-do you want to get some food?

23:17.163 --> 23:19.131
There's a great fondue place
that-that delivers

23:19.165 --> 23:20.433
right around the corner.

23:20.467 --> 23:21.568
Sounds great.
I've never had it.

23:21.601 --> 23:22.735
Great.

23:22.769 --> 23:24.504
(laughs)
God...

23:25.705 --> 23:27.206
You've really just turned
this night around for me.

23:27.239 --> 23:28.641
Ah...

23:28.675 --> 23:30.710
You know, I was so scared

23:30.743 --> 23:32.712
but now, um,

23:32.745 --> 23:34.213
I just feel like
a piece of bread

23:34.246 --> 23:35.882
in a warm bath of cheese.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.149
Hmm.

23:37.183 --> 23:38.184
That's fondue.

23:38.217 --> 23:39.218
I'm describing fondue.

23:39.251 --> 23:40.152
Oh, gotcha.

23:40.186 --> 23:41.988
Yeah, I thought
it was some kind of soup.

23:42.021 --> 23:43.089
No! I'm sorry.

23:43.122 --> 23:44.624
That was confusing.
That was my bad.

23:44.657 --> 23:46.493
(doorbell rings)

23:46.526 --> 23:48.227
Hmm, that's weird.
I'm not expecting anybody.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.663
Oh, it's probably the cops.

23:50.697 --> 23:51.731
Cops-- Sorry, hmm?

23:51.764 --> 23:52.865
Josh?

23:52.899 --> 23:53.666
You called the cops?

23:53.700 --> 23:54.701
Of course I did.

23:54.734 --> 23:55.802
No, no, but Josh, Josh,

23:55.835 --> 23:57.003
J-Josh, you know what they say.

23:57.036 --> 23:58.538
Snitches get stitches.

23:58.571 --> 23:59.872
Come on in, Officer.

23:59.906 --> 24:01.674
I got a call about
the attempted burglary?

24:01.708 --> 24:03.976
You know what?
The-the glass is just smashed.

24:04.010 --> 24:05.578
They smashed the whole door.

24:05.612 --> 24:06.913
Don't worry, I'm here now.

24:06.946 --> 24:08.481
And rest assured, ma'am,

24:08.515 --> 24:10.750
I won't stop till I get
to the bottom of this.

24:10.783 --> 24:11.784
(sighs)

24:17.757 --> 24:19.225
When did the incident occur?

24:19.258 --> 24:20.727
You know, no idea.

24:20.760 --> 24:21.994
I, uh, it was like this
when I got home.

24:22.028 --> 24:23.530
Why didn't you call the police

24:23.563 --> 24:24.764
when you first
discovered the window?

24:24.797 --> 24:25.865
I panicked, you know?

24:25.898 --> 24:27.033
I just,
I-I-I freaked out.

24:27.066 --> 24:28.200
And I just, I fled.

24:28.234 --> 24:29.602
"Fled"?

24:29.636 --> 24:30.870
Yeah, slow down!

24:30.903 --> 24:32.038
JOSH:
Okay, okay, just tell him

24:32.071 --> 24:33.873
what you know, Becks.

24:33.906 --> 24:36.609
She can't follow
if you talk too fast.

24:37.777 --> 24:39.879
Okay.

24:39.912 --> 24:41.914
Whew.

24:41.948 --> 24:43.916
So what happened

24:43.950 --> 24:45.752
is my friend, Josh Chan,

24:45.785 --> 24:48.688
called you because...

24:48.721 --> 24:50.523
he is so protective of me.

24:50.557 --> 24:52.058
Bless him.
But I understand

24:52.091 --> 24:53.726
that this is not really
worth your time.

24:53.760 --> 24:55.261
And the reason for that

24:55.294 --> 24:56.829
I will go into right now.

24:56.863 --> 24:58.798
All right, as I look

24:58.831 --> 24:59.699
at this crime scene,

24:59.732 --> 25:01.734
there appears to be
no evidence of theft

25:01.768 --> 25:04.804
or any sign that someone entered
the apartment at all.

25:04.837 --> 25:07.874
Let's take a closer look at
the shards of glass, shall we?

25:07.907 --> 25:10.009
Now, when I look at these
shards of glass,

25:10.042 --> 25:12.011
there is also no evidence
of secondary compression

25:12.044 --> 25:14.881
by a shoe or shoes,
to use the plural.

25:14.914 --> 25:16.683
So I think we
can safely say

25:16.716 --> 25:18.017
that no matter
what transpired here,

25:18.050 --> 25:20.252
we will never be able
to prove a 459.

25:20.286 --> 25:21.721
Josh, that's burglary.

25:21.754 --> 25:23.189
Now, sir, I am a lawyer,

25:23.222 --> 25:24.857
as you might've guessed,
and I know,

25:24.891 --> 25:26.559
looking at the glass
breakage here,

25:26.593 --> 25:28.327
the most we'll be able
to prove is, uh, maybe a 596?

25:28.360 --> 25:29.829
Josh, that's vandalism.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.564
Now, I know how hard

25:31.598 --> 25:33.199
the officers of this city work.

25:33.232 --> 25:34.801
And the last thing I want

25:34.834 --> 25:36.869
is for you to work
on a bunch of forms tonight.

25:36.903 --> 25:38.905
I mean, those 596 forms,
they're a real bitch.

25:38.938 --> 25:40.607
(chuckles)
You're not wrong.

25:40.640 --> 25:41.674
Exactly! I mean,

25:41.708 --> 25:43.710
23 pages for a nonviolent crime?

25:43.743 --> 25:44.777
What do I need-- a hobby?

25:44.811 --> 25:46.913
I didn't think so.

25:46.946 --> 25:48.748
So let's get you out of here.

25:48.781 --> 25:50.650
Let's get you back out
on the streets, Officer Rhodes.

25:50.683 --> 25:52.184
Yeah, sorry, Officer.

25:52.218 --> 25:54.253
Or you're welcome to stay
for some fondue.

25:54.286 --> 25:55.722
Oh, I wish!

25:55.755 --> 25:56.856
Love those steak cubes.

25:56.889 --> 25:58.791
Wait a minute,
I thought it was cheese.

25:58.825 --> 26:01.193
(laughs)

26:01.227 --> 26:02.829
Well, now I really
need some wine.

26:02.862 --> 26:04.296
Oh, my God. Me, too.

26:04.330 --> 26:05.998
Hand it over.

26:06.032 --> 26:07.967
Ah, now where were we?

26:08.000 --> 26:09.368
Oh, right.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.971
Cheers.

26:12.004 --> 26:13.339
(laughs)

26:13.372 --> 26:14.907
You were great back there.

26:14.941 --> 26:16.208
No, you were.

26:16.242 --> 26:17.844
Mm-mm.
You saved the day.

26:17.877 --> 26:19.245
I never committed
a crime before.

26:19.278 --> 26:21.080
Why did I commit a crime again?

26:21.113 --> 26:22.982
We said no questions,
remember?

26:23.015 --> 26:25.217
Aw, come on,
tell me, please?

26:25.251 --> 26:26.886
No.

26:26.919 --> 26:28.888
Gonna have to try
and get it out of me.

26:28.921 --> 26:29.989
Oh.

26:30.022 --> 26:32.158
Where do you
keep your answers?

26:32.191 --> 26:34.193
(laughs)

26:37.997 --> 26:39.999
I'm sorry.

26:41.300 --> 26:43.870
I know I've been
distant lately and...

26:43.903 --> 26:47.273
it's not just because
I almost had an affair

26:47.306 --> 26:50.943
with a hunky industrial
real estate tycoon from Tucson.

26:50.977 --> 26:52.178
What?

26:52.211 --> 26:54.981
It's a long story
and nothing happened.

26:55.014 --> 26:57.183
It was just jazz.

26:57.216 --> 26:58.985
Wow, huh.

26:59.018 --> 27:00.987
Well, then I feel
a lot better about the fact

27:01.020 --> 27:02.889
that I almost slept
with Misty from shipping.

27:02.922 --> 27:04.123
Misty?

27:04.156 --> 27:05.925
Really?

27:05.958 --> 27:07.727
You know, I can see that.

27:07.760 --> 27:08.761
She has slut face.

27:08.795 --> 27:09.996
(smacks tongue)

27:10.029 --> 27:10.963
God!

27:10.997 --> 27:12.331
Father Brah's right.

27:12.364 --> 27:13.966
We've both been
major holes, huh?

27:14.000 --> 27:15.902
God. we really have!

27:15.935 --> 27:17.770
I am so sorry.

27:17.804 --> 27:19.338
I don't want another man.

27:19.371 --> 27:21.908
I mean, the only thing I've
been cheating on you with

27:21.941 --> 27:23.409
is...

27:23.442 --> 27:25.978
Rebecca's love life.

27:26.979 --> 27:28.080
She's so in love,

27:28.114 --> 27:29.949
and it-it's just been
so intoxicating

27:29.982 --> 27:32.018
to witness it
in its purest form.

27:32.051 --> 27:35.087
I'm... I'm addicted.

27:35.121 --> 27:36.923
Who's she in love with?

27:36.956 --> 27:39.191
You really want to know?

27:39.225 --> 27:40.359
Yes, I do.

27:40.392 --> 27:42.228
And we got nothing
but time right now.

27:42.261 --> 27:45.031
Okay.

27:45.064 --> 27:47.099
Well, what happened was

27:47.133 --> 27:49.435
she was working hard
at a New York job

27:49.468 --> 27:51.804
making dough,
but it made her blue.

27:51.838 --> 27:53.205
One day, she was
crying a lot,

27:53.239 --> 27:56.909
and so she decided to move
to West Covina, California.

27:56.943 --> 27:58.911
Brand new pals, new career.

27:58.945 --> 28:01.981
It happens to be
where Josh lives.
Ah.

28:02.014 --> 28:04.150
And that's exactly
why she's here.

28:04.183 --> 28:07.019
(laughs)
She's a crazy ex-girlfriend.

28:07.053 --> 28:08.187
Wha...? No, she's not.

28:08.220 --> 28:09.455
She's a crazy ex-girlfriend.

28:09.488 --> 28:10.890
That's a sexist term, Scott.

28:10.923 --> 28:12.291
She's a crazy ex-girlfriend.

28:12.324 --> 28:14.026
Okay, just stop talking
for a second.

28:14.060 --> 28:15.494
She's so broken inside.

28:15.527 --> 28:17.764
This situation has
a lot more nuance than that.

28:17.797 --> 28:19.131
C-R-A-Z-Y!

28:19.165 --> 28:21.067
I know how to spell, Scott.

28:21.100 --> 28:21.968
She's a crazy ex-girlfriend.

28:26.072 --> 28:28.507
Wow, good thing
you brought those gloves.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.943
Oh, yeah, I've got gloves
for every situation.

28:30.977 --> 28:34.080
I mean, cleaning, baseball,

28:34.113 --> 28:35.481
golfing,

28:35.514 --> 28:38.217
uh, driving, go-karts, boxing.

28:38.250 --> 28:40.086
(laughs)
You have all the gloves.

28:41.153 --> 28:43.089
No way.

28:43.122 --> 28:44.290
Is that what I think it is?

28:44.323 --> 28:45.825
Oh, my gosh, what?
Is it, like, a penny?

28:45.858 --> 28:46.926
The rock they threw

28:46.959 --> 28:49.128
in the window.

28:49.161 --> 28:51.030
Wow, it's,
like, a perfect rock.

28:51.063 --> 28:53.032
Like textbook.
Yeah.

28:58.204 --> 28:59.405
* Where is the rock

28:59.438 --> 29:01.808
* Rock *
* That says ever

29:01.841 --> 29:03.876
* Where is the rock
* Rock *

29:03.910 --> 29:06.045
* That says ever

29:06.078 --> 29:08.414
* If the rock came
from inside your house *

29:08.447 --> 29:10.382
* That means he has to believe

29:10.416 --> 29:12.885
* That someone
broke into your house *

29:12.919 --> 29:15.822
* And then picked up a rock
* Rock *

29:15.855 --> 29:18.891
* And then went outside and
threw it through your window *

29:18.925 --> 29:23.262
* That would be
a super weird crime *

29:23.295 --> 29:26.966
* He's not he brightest,
but he's not dumb as a rock *

29:26.999 --> 29:29.902
* Rock *
* See what I did there?

29:34.340 --> 29:37.143
* Oh, my God,
he's turning over the rock *

29:37.176 --> 29:39.445
* Rock! *

29:39.478 --> 29:42.048
Hmm.

29:47.153 --> 29:49.455
So this...

29:49.488 --> 29:53.192
goes...

29:53.225 --> 29:56.162
right here.

29:58.197 --> 29:59.932
This is your rock?

30:11.343 --> 30:12.912
Wha...?

30:12.945 --> 30:14.246
Huh.

30:14.280 --> 30:15.882
That's so wei...

30:15.915 --> 30:17.483
It does

30:17.516 --> 30:19.185
look like my rock.

30:19.218 --> 30:20.519
That's weird.

30:20.552 --> 30:23.222
Someone threw a rock

30:23.255 --> 30:26.492
from inside the house...

30:26.525 --> 30:28.861
into your house?

30:30.296 --> 30:32.064
So, I think
I know what happened.

30:32.098 --> 30:34.300
So, the burglar
came into the house

30:34.333 --> 30:37.269
to steal something, but because
I live a very simple life,

30:37.303 --> 30:39.238
he didn't find
anything to steal.

30:39.271 --> 30:41.173
And in a fit of rage,
the burglar was furthermore

30:41.207 --> 30:43.142
offended, you know,
by the platitudinous

30:43.175 --> 30:44.110
inspirational phrases

30:44.143 --> 30:46.345
of my rocks because
he's had a hard life--

30:46.378 --> 30:47.613
you know, in order
to be a burglar,

30:47.646 --> 30:49.215
you would've had
to had a hard life.

30:49.248 --> 30:51.217
So-so then in anger,
he grabbed one of the rocks

30:51.250 --> 30:53.252
and went outside
and just to stick it to me

30:53.285 --> 30:54.520
threw it through the window.

30:54.553 --> 30:57.223
What-what-what you're talking
about doesn't make any sense.

30:57.256 --> 30:59.191
None of this makes sense.

30:59.225 --> 31:00.526
Okay, you're right.

31:00.559 --> 31:02.061
There's got to be
another explanation, so let--

31:02.094 --> 31:03.229
Please, please don't explain.

31:03.262 --> 31:04.530
I don't want to know.

31:04.563 --> 31:06.132
I don't want to know
what happened tonight.

31:06.165 --> 31:07.233
And I really don't want to know

31:07.266 --> 31:08.600
why you were
in my apartment before.

31:10.269 --> 31:11.537
Uh, I got to go.

31:11.570 --> 31:12.538
What? No.

31:12.571 --> 31:14.306
Yeah, I got
an early day tomorrow.

31:14.340 --> 31:16.408
Josh, I love y--

31:20.246 --> 31:23.582
I love that you came
to my rescue tonight.

31:23.615 --> 31:25.651
(quietly):
Thank you.

31:30.957 --> 31:32.959
(door closes)

31:40.066 --> 31:42.634
(knocking)

31:42.668 --> 31:45.404
Josh. Josh, I'm sorry...

31:45.437 --> 31:48.340
You ordered the extra large
double dipper?

31:48.374 --> 31:49.541
The... uh, yeah.

31:51.978 --> 31:53.412
I've got two sets of sticks.

31:53.445 --> 31:55.181
It'll just take me
a minute to set up.

31:55.214 --> 31:57.149
We threw in some
strawberries and chocolate

31:57.183 --> 31:58.985
for that extra bit of romance.

31:59.018 --> 32:01.187
It's all ruined.

32:01.220 --> 32:02.621
People think that,
but actually

32:02.654 --> 32:04.957
the cheese does not
congeal in transit.

32:04.991 --> 32:06.292
If you can get
the word out about that,

32:06.325 --> 32:07.359
that would really help.

32:07.393 --> 32:10.396
Moments ago,
he held me in his arms.

32:11.497 --> 32:13.432
And then just now, he could

32:13.465 --> 32:15.401
barely look me in the eye.

32:17.236 --> 32:19.705
All of my dreams

32:19.738 --> 32:22.374
may have just been shattered.

32:22.408 --> 32:25.277
So this is not about cheese.

32:25.311 --> 32:27.313
*

32:44.496 --> 32:47.266
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentleman,
 please welcome to the stage

32:47.299 --> 32:50.336
to sing a song about
self-indulgent self-loathing,

32:50.369 --> 32:52.638
Miss Rebecca Bunch!

32:52.671 --> 32:54.340
(audience cheers, applauds)
Thank you!

32:54.373 --> 32:56.442
Thank you, thank you.

32:57.343 --> 33:00.012
It's so wonderful
to be back here,

33:00.046 --> 33:02.014
even though I'm here,

33:02.048 --> 33:05.517
singing this song, a lot.

33:05.551 --> 33:07.619
(ballad begins)

33:14.560 --> 33:16.495
* Well, Rebecca

33:16.528 --> 33:18.430
(audience whooping)
* You've done it now...

33:18.464 --> 33:21.100
Yeah, you guys know this one.

33:21.133 --> 33:23.402
* Karma's come to tap you

33:23.435 --> 33:26.305
* On the shoulder

33:26.338 --> 33:30.042
* All that lying
that's been festering *

33:30.076 --> 33:33.179
* Plus breaking and entering

33:33.212 --> 33:35.481
* Is coming now to crush you

33:35.514 --> 33:38.417
* Like a boulder

33:38.450 --> 33:42.388
* You ruined everything

33:42.421 --> 33:45.357
* You stupid bitch

33:45.391 --> 33:49.128
* You ruined everything

33:49.161 --> 33:52.064
* You stupid, stupid bitch

33:52.098 --> 33:55.667
* You're just a lying
little bitch who ruins things *

33:55.701 --> 33:59.371
* And wants the world to burn

33:59.405 --> 34:01.273
* Bitch

34:01.307 --> 34:04.576
* You're a stupid bitch

34:04.610 --> 34:07.446
* And lose some weight...

34:07.479 --> 34:09.481
(audience cheering)

34:12.618 --> 34:17.589
* I was so close to paradise

34:17.623 --> 34:22.428
* But now the only thing
I'm close to is defeat *

34:25.197 --> 34:28.100
* These shards are a metaphor
for my soul *

34:28.134 --> 34:31.402
* Won't stop the self-pity
'cause I'm on a roll *

34:31.437 --> 34:34.505
* Yes, Josh completes me
but how can that be *

34:34.540 --> 34:40.446
* When there's no me left
to complete? *

34:40.478 --> 34:43.581
* You ruined everything

34:43.614 --> 34:45.417
* You stupid bitch

34:45.451 --> 34:46.552
Sing with me!

34:46.585 --> 34:50.522
* You ruined everything

34:50.556 --> 34:53.259
* You stupid, stupid bitch...

34:53.292 --> 34:54.726
Yes, I deserve this!

34:54.760 --> 34:58.664
* You're just a poopy little
slut who doesn't think *

34:58.697 --> 35:01.833
* And deceives
the people she loves *

35:01.867 --> 35:04.703
* Now he knows
I'm not some innocent lamb *

35:04.736 --> 35:07.473
* He sees me for what I am

35:07.506 --> 35:11.743
* Which is a horrible,
stupid, dumb and ugly *

35:11.777 --> 35:16.482
* Fat and stupid,
simple, self-hating *

35:16.515 --> 35:23.489
* Bitch!

35:23.522 --> 35:25.524
(audience cheers, applauds)

35:34.866 --> 35:35.901
Whoa.

35:35.934 --> 35:37.536
What happened?

35:42.774 --> 35:44.443
Rebecca, what's wrong?
Are you okay?

35:44.476 --> 35:45.811
No, I'm not.

35:45.844 --> 35:47.346
Do you want to tell me
what happened?

35:48.514 --> 35:50.216
No.

35:50.249 --> 35:51.383
Let me help you.

35:51.417 --> 35:52.451
What can I do?

35:52.484 --> 35:53.685
Come on, let's get this mess

35:53.719 --> 35:55.654
cleaned up and you can
tell me what happened.
I'll just...

35:55.687 --> 35:58.457
Just leave it,
I'll get it later.

35:59.525 --> 36:00.692
Can you just stay with me

36:00.726 --> 36:01.693
for a little while?

36:01.727 --> 36:04.630
I... I can't be alone right now.

36:04.663 --> 36:06.932
Okay.

36:06.965 --> 36:08.467
(sighs)

36:08.500 --> 36:10.536
Thank you.

36:10.569 --> 36:11.670
We don't have to stand here.

36:11.703 --> 36:13.639
We can, like,
watch TV, you know...

36:13.672 --> 36:15.374
TV, yeah, sure.
Whatever you want.

36:15.407 --> 36:18.310
Let's just get this mess
cleaned up first.

36:18.344 --> 36:19.611
Okay.

36:21.713 --> 36:23.649
Thank you.

36:23.682 --> 36:24.583
Are you hungry?

36:24.616 --> 36:25.917
Have you eaten?

36:25.951 --> 36:29.621
I have some... fondue
that's clumping together.

36:29.655 --> 36:32.291
Actually, I am pretty hungry.

36:32.324 --> 36:34.560
Coagulating cheese
would really hit the spot.

36:34.593 --> 36:35.561
(snorts)

36:35.594 --> 36:37.696
(laughs)

36:37.729 --> 36:39.798
Thank you, Greg.

36:41.500 --> 36:43.735
Somehow, you're always
here when I need you.

36:55.981 --> 36:56.982
I...

37:01.387 --> 37:02.754
Huh.

37:02.788 --> 37:04.556
That has Josh's name on it.

37:04.590 --> 37:07.259
That makes sense.

37:07.293 --> 37:09.328
He was barely here. I mean,
he didn't even eat his food.

37:09.361 --> 37:10.662
And there are two wine glasses,

37:10.696 --> 37:11.697
one with ice cubes.

37:11.730 --> 37:12.564
Classic Chan move.

37:12.598 --> 37:14.032
So you were having
another cozy date

37:14.065 --> 37:15.567
with Valencia's boyfriend and...

37:15.601 --> 37:16.635
Oh, my God,
that's not what happened.

37:16.668 --> 37:17.969
...you guys had
some kind of scene,

37:18.003 --> 37:19.438
somehow a window broke

37:19.471 --> 37:20.572
and look who's cleaning it up?

37:20.606 --> 37:23.709
I'm literally holding a dustpan
and a broom in my hand,

37:23.742 --> 37:24.843
cleaning up your mess.

37:24.876 --> 37:25.811
Why are you mad at me?

37:25.844 --> 37:26.978
I'm not mad at you,

37:27.012 --> 37:28.347
I'm mad at myself.

37:28.380 --> 37:30.682
(sighs)

37:30.716 --> 37:34.320
There are other ways
to get out of this building

37:34.353 --> 37:36.355
but I walked by your patio.

37:37.856 --> 37:39.758
And my girlfriend is
20 feet through that wall,

37:39.791 --> 37:41.793
and I'm standing here.

37:43.729 --> 37:45.364
I gotta go.

37:46.732 --> 37:47.733
Please, Greg...

37:48.667 --> 37:51.537
I just want someone
to be here with me.

37:51.570 --> 37:52.638
Right.

37:52.671 --> 37:53.739
"Someone."

37:53.772 --> 37:55.641
That's the problem.

37:55.674 --> 37:57.909
Feel better, Bunch.

38:03.682 --> 38:05.651
SCOTT:
 So she's not into Greg?

38:05.684 --> 38:08.687
No, not at all,
but he is really into her,

38:08.720 --> 38:10.055
so they keep getting
drawn together.

38:10.088 --> 38:11.490
But from what you've said,

38:11.523 --> 38:12.724
they might make a good couple.

38:12.758 --> 38:14.360
Maybe she should
give him a chance.

38:14.393 --> 38:17.062
No! Honey, keep your eyes
on the prize, okay?

38:17.095 --> 38:19.064
Rebecca and Josh have
an epic and pure love

38:19.097 --> 38:20.766
that spans decades
and mountains.

38:20.799 --> 38:22.668
Good point, she did admit
she loved Josh

38:22.701 --> 38:23.835
after the bus trip.

38:23.869 --> 38:25.070
(gasps) Yes!

38:25.103 --> 38:26.572
Very good!

38:26.605 --> 38:28.774
Oh, did I tell you about
how I got her invited

38:28.807 --> 38:30.776
to Josh's parents' house
for Thanksgiving?

38:30.809 --> 38:32.010
Was that when she got
the kiss on the cheek?

38:32.043 --> 38:33.579
Oh...

38:33.612 --> 38:35.414
No, no, no, no, that was
when they went to the camp.

38:41.019 --> 38:43.589
God, it's so sexy
when you listen.

38:46.157 --> 38:47.826
(laughing)

38:53.699 --> 38:55.367
Thought I might find you here,

38:55.401 --> 38:58.737
having your morning mocha loco.

38:58.770 --> 39:01.006
So... what happened?

39:01.039 --> 39:02.374
You never called me back.

39:02.408 --> 39:03.642
I called you, like, 50 times.

39:03.675 --> 39:05.544
I mean, did Josh just leave

39:05.577 --> 39:07.513
or is he on his way?

39:08.714 --> 39:10.782
Honey, what happened?

39:10.816 --> 39:12.784
I, um...

39:12.818 --> 39:15.020
I ruined everything, Paula.

39:15.053 --> 39:17.789
Like... it was a disaster.

39:19.190 --> 39:21.893
You can't even imagine
how bad it was.

39:21.927 --> 39:23.629
Well, how? I mean,
we got the rock

39:23.662 --> 39:24.796
through the window
before you got home.

39:24.830 --> 39:25.897
I don't want to talk about it.

39:25.931 --> 39:26.932
That's how bad it is.

39:26.965 --> 39:28.166
I-I...

39:28.199 --> 39:29.735
I just don't even
want to talk about it.

39:29.768 --> 39:31.803
Just... okay.

39:31.837 --> 39:33.672
(exhales)

39:33.705 --> 39:36.808
I ruined everything.

39:36.842 --> 39:39.478
Because that's what I do.

39:39.511 --> 39:41.179
I ruin things.
Okay.

39:41.212 --> 39:42.180
So that's what happened.

39:42.213 --> 39:43.582
Okay. Okay.

39:43.615 --> 39:45.717
Hey... I don't
know what happened,

39:45.751 --> 39:47.986
and we do not have
to talk about it. Now.

39:48.019 --> 39:51.457
I mean, clearly I'm going
to need all the deets later.

39:51.490 --> 39:52.524
Paula...
But you are... hey.

39:52.558 --> 39:53.925
You are not a ruiner.

39:53.959 --> 39:55.794
Okay, do you hear me?

39:55.827 --> 39:57.863
You are the opposite.
You're a-a put-together-er.

39:57.896 --> 39:59.865
Paula, you don't know
what you're talking about,

39:59.898 --> 40:01.032
and it doesn't even make sense.

40:01.066 --> 40:03.769
Oh, okay, you want to know
what you put together-ered?

40:03.802 --> 40:05.804
My marriage.

40:05.837 --> 40:07.739
What?
Yes!

40:07.773 --> 40:10.776
I mean, who knew a little
vandalism would be, like,

40:10.809 --> 40:14.212
the most amazing
foreplay we had ever had?!

40:14.245 --> 40:16.848
I mean, look at
this text from Scott.

40:16.882 --> 40:18.517
I mean, look at
all these emojis.

40:18.550 --> 40:20.519
He sent me, like,
a unicorn and a panda.

40:20.552 --> 40:22.821
Hmm.
And, like, 11 different
kinds of hearts.

40:22.854 --> 40:24.723
Oh.
(laughing)

40:24.756 --> 40:26.658
Oh, no, no, don't
scroll there. Oh.
Whoa.

40:26.692 --> 40:27.826
Yeah. Okay.
Wow.

40:27.859 --> 40:29.528
Sorry. I'm sorry
you had to see that.

40:29.561 --> 40:33.198
No. You... you go.

40:33.231 --> 40:35.601
Okay, but listen to me.

40:35.634 --> 40:37.836
You and Josh--
you're on a journey.

40:37.869 --> 40:39.805
Okay? So there's
gonna be peaks,

40:39.838 --> 40:41.640
but there's also
gonna be valleys.

40:41.673 --> 40:45.511
And yes, maybe even a
long, dry, flat plateau

40:45.544 --> 40:47.045
called "my-kids-are-little,
don't-touch-me."

40:47.078 --> 40:51.617
But the valleys are gonna
make those peaks even sweeter.

40:51.650 --> 40:54.853
So... take a deep breath.

40:58.857 --> 41:01.860
Look how beautiful
it is today.

41:01.893 --> 41:06.632
And know that everything
is gonna be okay.

41:06.665 --> 41:10.936
And if it's not,
we will make it okay.

41:10.969 --> 41:13.705
I promise you.

41:15.273 --> 41:17.242
Are you sure?

41:17.275 --> 41:19.845
We will find a way.

41:19.878 --> 41:21.780
Come here.

41:21.813 --> 41:23.915
I swear.

41:25.951 --> 41:28.253
I think I have a UTI.

41:32.591 --> 41:34.793
Harry, did you okay
a police escort to get a woman

41:34.826 --> 41:36.094
to her ex-boyfriend's
house faster?

41:36.127 --> 41:37.996
Yes, sir, but you have
to understand...

41:38.029 --> 41:40.566
Judge Spenser, that was
an unnecessary expenditure,

41:40.599 --> 41:42.934
not to mention
you put our citizens at risk.

41:42.968 --> 41:44.636
But sir, it was urgent.

41:44.670 --> 41:46.137
It was a text-mergency.

41:46.171 --> 41:48.306
You mean a text-tastrophe?

41:48.339 --> 41:50.976
Is that what caught on?

41:51.009 --> 41:52.310
It figures.

41:52.343 --> 41:53.679
Damn it!

41:53.712 --> 41:54.846
Judge Spenser,

41:54.880 --> 41:56.882
why are you getting so upset?

41:57.916 --> 41:59.885
What's this really about?

41:59.918 --> 42:03.254
I left my wife for a prostitute.
