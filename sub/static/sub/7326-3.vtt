00:03.104 --> 00:04.175
(Meredith)
THERE'S THIS PLAYGROUND GAME

00:04.175 --> 00:05.336
THAT KIDS PLAY.

00:05.336 --> 00:07.208
(Bailey crying)

00:07.208 --> 00:09.740
(Derek, muffled voice) I'LL
GET HIM. YOU CAN'T PICK HIM UP.

00:09.740 --> 00:11.212
(crying continues)

00:11.212 --> 00:12.343
YES, I CAN.

00:12.343 --> 00:15.246
NO, YOUR INCISION NEEDS TO HEAL.
I GOT HIM.

00:15.246 --> 00:17.088
THEY LOCK HANDS,
AND ON THE COUNT OF 3...

00:17.088 --> 00:18.289
(groans)

00:18.289 --> 00:20.251
THEY TRY TO SNAP
EACH OTHER'S FINGERS OFF.

00:20.251 --> 00:22.223
HURRY UP
BEFORE HE WAKES UP THE...

00:22.223 --> 00:24.195
(Zola) MOMMY?

00:24.195 --> 00:26.097
GIRLS.

00:26.097 --> 00:27.358
(Sofia babbles)

00:27.358 --> 00:29.130
YOU HOLD OUT
AS LONG AS YOU CAN...

OH, SHE'S PASSED OUT
WITH HER FRIENDS.

01:38.869 --> 01:40.301
AGAIN.

01:40.301 --> 01:42.303
DID SHE EVER SLEEP WITH YOU?

(song ends)

01:43.234 --> 01:45.136
(distant barking continues)

DID YOU GUYS HAVE SEX,
AND IT WAS AWFUL?

01:47.238 --> 01:48.739
WAS SHE AWFUL?
NO.

01:48.739 --> 01:50.411
WERE YOU AWFUL,

01:50.411 --> 01:52.483
AND NOW YOU'RE SO ASHAMED
YOU CAN'T EVEN LOOK AT HER?
NO.

01:52.483 --> 01:54.145
OOH, WAS IT WEIRD?

01:54.145 --> 01:55.316
IS SHE A MAN?

01:55.316 --> 01:57.248
OOH. SECRET PENIS.

01:57.248 --> 01:58.449
SHUT UP!

01:58.449 --> 01:59.420
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU GUYS EVER
SLEEP TOGETHER?

01:59.420 --> 02:01.152
WE WILL!

02:01.152 --> 02:02.393
OHH.

02:02.393 --> 02:05.656
YOU TWO HAVEN'T DONE IT YET.
WE DO.

02:05.656 --> 02:06.897
OH, YOU DO DONE IT?
WE HAVE.

02:06.897 --> 02:08.159
OH--OH, YOU HAVE? YOU DO?
WE--WE--WE--WE DO.

02:08.159 --> 02:09.560
OKAY. OH--
WE DO!

02:09.560 --> 02:12.863
JUST GET OUT!
OKAY. HMM. OKAY.
JUST THINK ABOUT THAT.

02:12.863 --> 02:14.835
(exhales deeply)
'CAUSE IT'S BEEN, LIKE,

02:14.835 --> 02:17.208
A WEEK AND YOU HAVEN'T
CLOSED THE DEAL.

02:17.208 --> 02:19.710
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
TO EVIL SPAWN?

02:19.710 --> 02:21.172
I WAS SLEEPING.

02:21.172 --> 02:23.374
(laughs)

02:23.374 --> 02:25.546
OH! OH, GOD!
I KNEW YOU'D CHEER ME UP.

02:25.546 --> 02:26.817
MNH!

02:26.817 --> 02:29.850
(sighs)

02:29.850 --> 02:31.322
WOULD IT KILL HER

02:31.322 --> 02:32.723
TO BRING ME MORE THAN ONE PAIR
OF SOFIA'S SOCKS?

02:32.723 --> 02:34.855
FRICKIN' THOUGHTLESS.

02:34.855 --> 02:36.187
WHERE ARE SOFIA AND ZOLA?

02:36.187 --> 02:37.888
UM, UM, DEREK'S PUTTING
THEIR SHOES ON.

02:37.888 --> 02:39.260
AH.

02:39.260 --> 02:40.391
(Sofia and Zola giggling)

02:40.391 --> 02:41.362
ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN HANDLE
BOTH OF THEM?

02:41.362 --> 02:43.163
(sighs deeply) YES.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.266
THEY'RE THE ONLY PEOPLE
WHO DON'T PISS ME OFF RIGHT NOW.
(laughs)

02:45.266 --> 02:46.797
I'LL TEXT YOU WHEN THEY'RE
BOTH IN DAY CARE. HI!

02:46.797 --> 02:48.168
AH! YOU'RE A GODDESS.
(giggles)

02:48.168 --> 02:50.341
AND YET MY W-I-F-E
STILL SLEEPS AROUND.

02:50.341 --> 02:51.542
(singsongy) OKAY, LADIES!

02:51.542 --> 02:53.244
(Callie gasps) YES, HERE WE GO!
HERE WE GO!

02:53.244 --> 02:54.505
HERE, TAKE YOUR DUCK.
TAKE YOUR DUCK.

02:54.505 --> 02:55.946
(gasps) WE'RE GOING ON
A FERRY RIDE.

02:55.946 --> 02:57.578
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU. HAVE A GOOD DAY.

02:57.578 --> 02:59.510
(sighs) OH.

02:59.510 --> 03:00.851
OHH. WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO

03:00.851 --> 03:03.584
WHEN SHE FIXES HER MARRIAGE
AND LEAVES US?

03:03.584 --> 03:06.417
OH, I THINK WE'RE A WAYS OFF
FROM THAT.
(pants) OH!

03:06.417 --> 03:07.688
Hey, I'm back. You still there?

03:07.688 --> 03:08.859
OH!
(Derek groans)

03:08.859 --> 03:10.321
HI. HOW'S--
HOW'S EVERYTHING GOING?

03:10.321 --> 03:12.423
IT'S... FINE.

03:12.423 --> 03:14.965
UH, NOT THE EASIEST PATIENT,
BUT I GOT HIS NUMBER.

03:14.965 --> 03:16.897
HEY, IS HE STILL LOSING WEIGHT?
His appetite's not great.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.729
BUT THAT HAPPENS.
YOU KNOW THAT.

03:18.729 --> 03:20.901
RIGHT. AND YOU'RE SURE
YOU DON'T NEED MY HELP?

03:20.901 --> 03:23.304
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
GO SNUGGLE YOUR BABY.

03:23.304 --> 03:24.605
OKAY.

03:24.605 --> 03:26.607
WILL YOU LET ME KNOW
IF HIS ALBUMIN DROPS BELOW 2.5?

03:26.607 --> 03:28.579
I'M HANGING UP.
STOP CALLING ME.

03:28.579 --> 03:30.941
(beeps)

03:32.413 --> 03:33.844
RICHARD WEBBER.

03:33.844 --> 03:36.717
SEVEN DAYS STATUS POST EX LAP
WITH PANCREATIC DEBRIDEMENT.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.919
HIS DAILY WEIGHTS
ARE TRENDING DOWN.

03:38.919 --> 03:40.991
ALBUMIN'S LOW AT 2.

03:40.991 --> 03:42.623
O.T. WANTS TO DO
A SWALLOW STUDY.
(pens scribbling)

03:42.623 --> 03:45.596
IN THE MEANTIME, I RECOMMEND
STARTING N.G. TUBE FEEDS.

03:45.596 --> 03:47.298
NO.

03:47.298 --> 03:49.630
NO TUBE.

03:49.630 --> 03:52.232
(monitor beeping steadily)

03:52.232 --> 03:54.605
HE DOESN'T SEEM TO WANT A TUBE.

03:54.605 --> 03:56.807
RESPECTFULLY, DR. BAILEY...

03:58.869 --> 04:01.272
MAKE SURE TO REPLETE
HIS ELECTROLYTES,

04:01.272 --> 04:03.314
AND HE'LL START RECOVERING.

04:03.314 --> 04:05.576
WE'VE ALREADY GIVEN HIM--
GIVE HIM MORE.

04:13.784 --> 04:16.927
WHERE THE HELL IS SHANE? HE WAS
SUPPOSED TO STUDY WITH US.

04:16.927 --> 04:18.889
MM, MORE PRACTICE FOR US.

04:18.889 --> 04:20.531
JO, HIT ME.
DUDE, PANTS!

04:20.531 --> 04:23.294
(sighs) CRAP. SORRY.
I'M STUCK ON A QUESTION.

04:23.294 --> 04:24.495
WHAT'S WITH THE UNDERWEAR?

04:24.495 --> 04:25.696
TOTALLY NOT WORK-APPROPRIATE.

04:25.696 --> 04:27.998
(sighs) I'M WAITING FOR ALEX
TO MAKE A MOVE,

04:27.998 --> 04:30.901
SO I'M PREPARED ALL THE TIME.
WHAT ABOUT GROOMING?

04:30.901 --> 04:32.543
ALL THE TIME.
THAT'S EXHAUSTING.

04:32.543 --> 04:34.274
(sighs)
WHY DON'T YOU JUST MAKE
THE FIRST MOVE?

04:34.274 --> 04:37.608
'CAUSE I'M NOT THE SLUT WHO JUST
JUMPS INTO BED WITH SOMEONE

04:37.608 --> 04:39.279
RIGHT AFTER HER FRIEND DIED.
(whispers) REALLY?

04:39.279 --> 04:40.451
(slaps hand)

04:40.451 --> 04:42.012
WELL, I'M NOT GONNA
ADVERTISE IT.

04:42.012 --> 04:44.315
(pager beeps)
TRAUMA IN THE PIT. GOTTA GO.

04:44.315 --> 04:46.687
IT'S BEEN A WEEK, AND HE HASN'T
MADE A MOVE. IS THAT WEIRD?

04:46.687 --> 04:48.058
YEAH.

04:48.058 --> 04:50.020
(groans)
(thud)

04:50.020 --> 04:53.023
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

04:53.023 --> 04:54.725
(clears throat)

04:56.597 --> 04:57.998
HAIRCUT.
(elevator bell dings)

04:57.998 --> 04:59.870
YES.

04:59.870 --> 05:01.732
(indistinct conversations)

05:01.732 --> 05:03.674
(telephone ringing)

05:03.674 --> 05:04.975
YOU CAN'T JUST SAY
"HAIRCUT."

05:04.975 --> 05:06.537
YOU HAVE TO SAY
"NICE HAIRCUT."

05:06.537 --> 05:07.978
OTHERWISE, I'LL THINK THAT
YOU THINK IT'S A BAD HAIRCUT.

05:07.978 --> 05:10.010
AND I'M WEARING A DRESS
AND I GOT A HAIRCUT

05:10.010 --> 05:11.742
'CAUSE I WANNA LOOK NICE TODAY.
DO I LOOK NICE?

05:11.742 --> 05:12.943
YOU LOOK TENSE.

05:12.943 --> 05:14.515
SAY I LOOK NICE!
YOU LOOK NICE.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.447
WAS THAT SO HARD?
MM.

05:16.447 --> 05:18.449
(clears throat)
HERE WE ARE.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.021
(Arizona) OH, MY GOD.

05:21.021 --> 05:22.393
(Cristina)
WHY ARE WE HERE?

05:22.393 --> 05:24.595
SO YOU CAN SEE IT
FOR YOURSELF

05:24.595 --> 05:25.996
SO THIS IS NOT
JUST A CONCEPT.

05:25.996 --> 05:27.928
THERE IS A HOLE
IN THIS HOSPITAL,

05:27.928 --> 05:29.460
AND IT IS LEAKING MONEY.

05:29.460 --> 05:30.631
BUT ISN'T THAT WHAT
INSURANCE IS FOR?

05:30.631 --> 05:32.102
THEY ARE SWAMPED
WITH STORM CLAIMS.

05:32.102 --> 05:34.034
NOW WITH THIS
OUTPATIENT SURGERY WING GONE,

05:34.034 --> 05:37.808
ALL OF THOSE PATIENTS ARE NOW
OVERLOADING OUR REGULAR O.R.s.

05:37.808 --> 05:38.969
WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT US
TO DO ABOUT IT?

05:38.969 --> 05:42.042
MEET. MAKE A PLAN.
BE THE BOARD.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.514
WE'RE ALL SWAMPED.

05:43.514 --> 05:45.416
AND MEREDITH AND DEREK ARE
ON LEAVE. WEBBER'S DOWN.

05:45.416 --> 05:48.719
YEAH, AND YOU AND TORRES
CAN'T BE IN THE SAME ROOM.

05:48.719 --> 05:50.080
(sighs)

05:50.080 --> 05:52.022
I HAVE--I HAVE A PATIENT.

05:53.554 --> 05:54.985
YOU KNOW, RIGHT NOW

05:54.985 --> 05:57.428
THIS HOSPITAL NEEDS DOCTORS MORE
THAN IT NEEDS BOARD MEMBERS.

05:57.428 --> 05:59.029
WHAT THIS HOSPITAL NEEDS
IS BOTH.

05:59.029 --> 06:03.794
IF YOU PEOPLE CAN'T BE BOTH,
THEN WE ARE IN A LOT OF TROUBLE.

06:07.998 --> 06:09.670
(sighs deeply)

06:09.670 --> 06:11.041
HEY.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.109
I SHOULD GO.

06:19.109 --> 06:21.412
WHY?

06:21.412 --> 06:24.515
WE CAN'T BE ALONE TOGETHER.

06:24.515 --> 06:28.459
WE'RE JUST...
TALKING ABOUT WORK.

06:29.560 --> 06:34.124
(horn blares in distance)

06:34.124 --> 06:36.897
(indistinct conversations)

06:36.897 --> 06:38.098
(telephone ringing,
siren wailing in distance)

06:38.098 --> 06:39.670
(woman) NURSES' STATION.
CAN I HELP YOU?

06:39.670 --> 06:40.831
UGH!

06:40.831 --> 06:42.933
YOU ALL RIGHT?

06:44.875 --> 06:46.176
YEAH.

06:46.176 --> 06:47.538
(woman) NURSES' STATION.
PLEASE HOLD.

06:47.538 --> 06:49.079
NO. I--NO.

06:49.079 --> 06:50.511
I HAVEN'T HEARD YET.

06:50.511 --> 06:52.713
UH...

06:52.713 --> 06:54.144
ABOUT MY BOARDS.

06:54.144 --> 06:55.786
OH.

06:55.786 --> 06:56.987
YEAH.

06:56.987 --> 06:59.149
BUT DON'T FREAK OUT.
YOU PASSED.

06:59.149 --> 07:00.621
WELL, IF I DIDN'T,

07:00.621 --> 07:02.092
YOU'LL KNOW THAT THE FIRST TIME
WASN'T YOUR FAULT.

07:02.092 --> 07:03.454
(chuckles)
(elevator bell dings)

07:03.454 --> 07:04.895
IT WAS ALL ME.

07:04.895 --> 07:06.196
(siren wails in distance)

07:06.196 --> 07:07.898
(sighs) DON'T FREAK OUT.

07:07.898 --> 07:09.099
HEY.

07:09.099 --> 07:10.461
HEY. YOU'RE RIDING
WITH ME TODAY.

07:10.461 --> 07:11.702
YEAH, ABOUT THAT--
COME ON, IT'S A GOOD ONE.

07:11.702 --> 07:13.063
COMING THROUGH!
OH, WHAT DO WE GOT?

07:13.063 --> 07:15.035
HUMAN PINCUSHION.
(man) KATHLEEN KANE, 38.

07:15.035 --> 07:16.907
WOMAN VERSUS
SHATTERED BASEBALL BAT.

07:16.907 --> 07:18.068
PUNCTURE WOUNDS TO THE CHEST

07:18.068 --> 07:19.570
AND WHAT LOOKS LIKE
A DISTAL RADIUS FRACTURE.

07:19.570 --> 07:21.572
B.P. 85 PALP, PRESSURE 135.

07:21.572 --> 07:23.113
THE BATTER WAS JAMMED
WITH A FASTBALL,

07:23.113 --> 07:25.846
AND--AND THE BAT,
IT JUST EXPLODED, YOU KNOW?

07:25.846 --> 07:27.978
MY JERSEY'S REALLY MESSED UP.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT, BABY.

07:27.978 --> 07:30.080
OKAY, EVERYBODY. READY?
ON MY COUNT.

07:30.080 --> 07:31.952
ONE, TWO, THREE.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.123
(Kathleen grunts)

07:33.123 --> 07:35.025
I'M HERE.
I'M RIGHT HERE, OKAY?

07:35.025 --> 07:38.188
SOMEBODY PAGED ME?
POSSIBLE COLLES' FRACTURE.

07:38.188 --> 07:40.861
UH, SIR, I NEED YOU TO WAIT
OUTSIDE.

07:40.861 --> 07:42.533
ALL RIGHT? RIGHT NOW, SHE NEEDS
YOU TO GIVE US ROOM TO WORK.

07:42.533 --> 07:43.794
WE NEED ANOTHER NURSE IN HERE!

07:43.794 --> 07:46.196
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE SURE
SHE'S ALL RIGHT, RIGHT? KAT?

07:46.196 --> 07:47.998
ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA--I'M GONNA
SHOW YOU WHERE YOU CAN WAIT.
OKAY?

07:47.998 --> 07:49.239
DECREASED BREATH SOUNDS
ON THE RIGHT.

07:49.239 --> 07:50.801
WE NEED X-RAY IN HERE STAT!
(woman) RIGHT AWAY.

07:50.801 --> 07:53.974
(labored breathing) I'M DIZZY.
IT'S DARK.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.045
AM I DYING?
NO, MA'AM.

07:55.045 --> 07:56.947
HER SYSTOLIC'S DOWN TO 78.
TELL DANTE.

07:56.947 --> 07:59.209
YOU HAVE TO TELL DANTE.
LOOK AT ME.

07:59.209 --> 08:01.011
IF I DIE...
YOU'RE NOT DYING.

08:01.011 --> 08:02.553
YOU NEED TO TELL MY HUSBAND.
PROMISE ME.

08:02.553 --> 08:04.585
UH, OF COURSE.
HE NEEDS TO KNOW.

08:04.585 --> 08:06.757
AND TELL HIM...

08:06.757 --> 08:09.960
I WILL. WHAT IS IT?

08:09.960 --> 08:11.692
I CHEATED ON HIM
WITH HIS BROTHER.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.666
WHAT?!

08:15.666 --> 08:28.709
WHAT DID SHE SAY?

08:29.880 --> 08:31.111
DID YOU HEAR
WHAT SHE ASKED ME?

08:31.111 --> 08:32.112
PEOPLE SAY CRAZY THINGS
WHEN THEY'RE IN SHOCK.

08:32.112 --> 08:33.513
C.T. READY FOR US?

08:33.513 --> 08:34.945
HEY, KEPNER, DID YOU HEAR BACK
YET, BY THE WAY?

08:34.945 --> 08:36.647
NO, NOT YET.

08:36.647 --> 08:37.788
MM.
(telephone ringing)

08:37.788 --> 08:38.949
YOU THINK THAT'S BAD?

08:38.949 --> 08:40.090
YOU THINK IT'S GOOD?

08:40.090 --> 08:42.522
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

08:42.522 --> 08:44.625
SO DO I HAVE TO TELL
HER HUSBAND?
TELL HIM WHAT?

08:44.625 --> 08:46.557
SHE GRABBED ME
WITH HER BLOODY CLAW

08:46.557 --> 08:49.630
AND SAID IF SHE DIES TO TELL HIM
THAT SHE SLEPT WITH HIS BROTHER.

08:49.630 --> 08:50.701
WHOA.

08:50.701 --> 08:52.162
BITCH. MM.
(crunch)

08:52.162 --> 08:53.263
WHY WOULD SHE ASK ME
TO DO THAT?

08:53.263 --> 08:54.865
MAYBE SHE WANTS
A CLEAR CONSCIENCE.

08:54.865 --> 08:56.737
MAYBE HE CHEATED FIRST
AND TRASHED THE MARRIAGE.

08:56.737 --> 08:59.209
MAYBE HE'S AN INCONSIDERATE
CHEATING BASTARD,

08:59.209 --> 09:01.772
AND SHE WANTED TO GET
THE LAST WORD.

09:01.772 --> 09:03.744
SO... I DON'T HAVE TO
TELL HIM, RIGHT?

09:03.744 --> 09:05.175
HOW ABOUT YOU JUST
DON'T LET HER DIE?

09:05.175 --> 09:06.747
OKAY, WE CAN'T WAIT FOR C.T.
WE GOTTA GET HER INTO THE O.R.

09:06.747 --> 09:07.948
WE'LL PUT THE CHEST TUBE
IN THERE.

09:09.279 --> 09:11.181
UH, SORRY. (chuckles)

09:11.181 --> 09:13.954
UH, JUST CONFIRMING
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT AT 7:00?

09:13.954 --> 09:15.786
YEAH, I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

09:15.786 --> 09:18.128
CALLIE, WE AGREED
TO COUPLES THERAPY.

09:18.128 --> 09:20.190
YEAH, WE AGREED
TO A LOT OF THINGS. SO...

09:20.190 --> 09:22.562
(ringing continues)

09:22.562 --> 09:24.935
OKAY, WELL, I'LL BE THERE.

09:24.935 --> 09:27.237
(door closes)

09:27.237 --> 09:30.741
MURPHY, MAKE YOURSELF USEFUL
AND PUT A SPLINT ON THAT ARM.

09:30.741 --> 09:32.002
(elevator bell dings)

09:32.002 --> 09:35.846
HE NEEDS AN N.G. TUBE,
DR. GREY.

09:35.846 --> 09:37.608
I WAS HOPING YOU COULD
CALL DR BAILEY AND--

09:37.608 --> 09:39.710
DR. BAILEY IS GONNA KILL ME
IF I CALL HER AGAIN.
(Bailey cooing)

09:39.710 --> 09:40.881
Richard is just
being stubborn,

09:40.881 --> 09:42.913
and Bailey doesn't want
to call him out.

09:42.913 --> 09:44.114
ORDER THE N.G. TUBE,

09:44.114 --> 09:45.816
AND THAT WAY,
AT LEAST IT WILL BE READY

09:45.816 --> 09:48.018
BY THE TIME BAILEY COMES
TO HER SENSES.

09:48.018 --> 09:50.791
BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT SHE--
I HAVE TO GO.

09:50.791 --> 09:51.792
(beep)

09:51.792 --> 09:53.894
(birds chirping)

09:53.894 --> 09:55.195
AN HOUR AND A HALF
TO GO GET MILK?
(door closes)

09:55.195 --> 09:57.367
I THINK, UM...

09:57.367 --> 10:01.802
I MIGHT'VE CLOSED MY EYES
IN THE STORE PARKING LOT.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.804
(clears throat)

10:03.804 --> 10:05.005
I REALLY SHOULD BE STUDYING.

10:05.005 --> 10:06.336
TRUST ME. YOU ARE GONNA WANT
TO BE IN ON THIS.

10:06.336 --> 10:08.278
THIS IS THE BEST PART
OF THE JOB.

10:08.278 --> 10:10.711
CARA. CARLOS.

10:10.711 --> 10:12.242
GUYS, THIS IS DR. EDWARDS.

10:12.242 --> 10:13.884
SHE'LL BE ASSISTING TODAY.

10:13.884 --> 10:16.246
AND I...
HAVE THE SIMULATION BACK.

10:16.246 --> 10:17.788
MM. SHOW ME. SHOW ME.

10:17.788 --> 10:19.920
OKAY, NOW FIRST, WE'RE GONNA
BE REMOVING THE SCARS

10:19.920 --> 10:23.393
USING TISSUE HARVESTED
FROM YOUR BACK AND SCALP.

10:23.393 --> 10:24.755
AND THEN I'M GONNA HIDE
OUR NEW SCARS

10:24.755 --> 10:26.797
RIGHT HERE IN THE FACIAL PLANES.

10:26.797 --> 10:28.628
AND IT'S GONNA LOOK
A LITTLE SOMETHING LIKE THIS...

10:28.628 --> 10:30.801
(tablet beeping)

10:30.801 --> 10:32.362
(Carlos) OH, MY GOD.

10:33.964 --> 10:35.135
REALLY?

10:35.135 --> 10:36.767
YOU CAN DO THAT?

10:36.767 --> 10:38.238
(voice breaks) YOU CAN MAKE ME
LOOK LIKE THAT?

10:38.238 --> 10:41.211
NOW IT'S A ESTIMATE,
BUT IT IS VERY, VERY CLOSE.

10:41.211 --> 10:42.773
AND IT'S FREE?

10:42.773 --> 10:45.015
'CAUSE OUR INSURANCE MAXED OUT
ABOUT TWO SURGERIES AGO.

10:45.015 --> 10:47.417
WE KNOW.
THAT'S WHY THIS ONE'S ON US.

10:50.851 --> 10:54.825
HEY, CARA.
(crying) I DIDN'T THINK I WAS
GONNA GET TO GO BACK TO WORK.

10:54.825 --> 10:56.787
SHE TEACHES KINDERGARTEN.

10:56.787 --> 10:58.388
YEAH, SHE'S AFRAID
SHE'S GONNA SCARE THE KIDS.

10:58.388 --> 11:00.160
AND SHE CAN'T TEACH WITHOUT
FEELING HER BEST, RIGHT?
(exhales deeply)

11:00.160 --> 11:02.763
(chuckles) YOU GUYS!

11:02.763 --> 11:03.934
(exhales deeply)

11:03.934 --> 11:05.736
THANK YOU...
(voice breaks) SO MUCH.

11:07.267 --> 11:08.869
(whispers) YOU STILL WANT
TO STUDY?

11:08.869 --> 11:12.102
SHE HAS LOST A LOT OF BLOOD,
BUT SHE'S STABLE FOR NOW.

11:12.102 --> 11:13.273
WE'RE GONNA TAKE HER
INTO SURGERY

11:13.273 --> 11:14.905
AND REMOVE THE FRAGMENTS.

11:14.905 --> 11:17.147
OKAY. OKAY, THANKS.

11:17.147 --> 11:20.911
MARCUS, SHE'S--
SHE'S GOING INTO SURGERY, MAN.

11:20.911 --> 11:22.452
IS SHE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT?

11:22.452 --> 11:23.814
UM...

11:23.814 --> 11:25.956
NO, IT'S OKAY. HE'S FAMILY.
HE'S MY BROTHER.

11:25.956 --> 11:27.287
(elevator bell dings)

11:30.060 --> 11:31.421
SHE'S...

11:31.421 --> 11:32.793
UH...

11:32.793 --> 11:34.995
I'M...

11:34.995 --> 11:36.797
GONNA...

11:36.797 --> 11:39.469
SEE YOU AFTER.

11:39.469 --> 11:41.872
THANKS, MAN.
(pats back)

11:41.872 --> 11:44.735
UH, IN THE 17 YEARS SINCE
YOUR INFANT HEART TRANSPLANT,

11:44.735 --> 11:46.036
YOUR MITRAL VALVE
HAS STARTED TO FAIL.

11:46.036 --> 11:48.378
SO REPLACING IT WOULD INCREASE
CARDIAC FUNCTION.

11:48.378 --> 11:50.310
AND HE WON'T NEED
ANOTHER TRANSPLANT.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.382
(Cristina) THAT IS THE HOPE.
I GOTTA ASK YOU AGAIN.

11:52.382 --> 11:54.214
ARE YOU SURE THAT YOU WANNA
DO THIS?

11:54.214 --> 11:56.416
THERE'S A HIGH RISK
OF TEARING A VENTRICLE,

11:56.416 --> 11:58.919
UH, BLEEDING, ARRHYTHMIAS--

11:58.919 --> 11:59.950
YOU'RE SAYING
HE'D NEED A TRANSPLANT ANYWAY.

11:59.950 --> 12:01.752
I'M SAYING
THAT HE COULD DIE.

12:01.752 --> 12:04.795
THE SAFEST BET IS TO PUT MICHAEL
ON THE LIST FOR A NEW HEART.

12:04.795 --> 12:06.396
NO.

12:06.396 --> 12:08.398
I UNDERSTAND THE RISKS.
WE TALKED ABOUT IT.

12:08.398 --> 12:11.762
WE ALMOST LOST HIM
WAITING FOR HIS LAST HEART.

12:11.762 --> 12:12.833
WHEN IT WAS CLEAR HE WAS DYING,

12:12.833 --> 12:14.805
I ASKED THE NURSE
IF I COULD HOLD HIM.

12:14.805 --> 12:16.907
HE WAS SO TINY.

12:16.907 --> 12:19.239
I SPENT A WHOLE NIGHT

12:19.239 --> 12:22.012
LOOKING IN HIS EYES,
TELLING HIM I LOVED HIM,

12:22.012 --> 12:26.046
ACCEPTING THAT I WOULD
NEVER, EVER HEAR HIS FIRST WORD.

12:26.046 --> 12:28.748
(voice breaks)
I HELD MY BABY WHILE HE DIED.

12:29.880 --> 12:31.922
(sniffles)
AND THEN THE PHONE RANG.

12:31.922 --> 12:33.523
(laughs and sniffles)

12:33.523 --> 12:35.525
BUT I ALMOST LOST HIM.

12:35.525 --> 12:37.487
AND I CANNOT GO THROUGH THAT
AGAIN.

12:37.487 --> 12:40.060
THE CHANCE THAT THERE WILL BE
ANOTHER DONOR THAT MATCHES ME,

12:40.060 --> 12:42.993
THAT I'LL LIVE LONG ENOUGH
FOR US TO FIND THAT PERSON,

12:42.993 --> 12:44.865
THAT I'LL EVEN GET TO
THE TOP OF THE LIST...

12:44.865 --> 12:46.897
WE LIKE THESE ODDS BETTER.

12:46.897 --> 12:48.839
OKAY.

12:48.839 --> 12:50.871
WELL, IF YOUR M.R.I. IS GOOD,

12:50.871 --> 12:52.142
WE'LL GET STARTED TODAY.

12:54.104 --> 12:55.545
THAT KID SHOULD BE
ON THE U.N.O.S. LIST.

12:55.545 --> 12:57.347
WELL, YOU HEARD THEM, ALEX.
THEY WANNA TAKE A SHOT.

12:57.347 --> 13:00.780
AND WHO ARE YOU TO SAY NO
TO A HIGH-RISK SURGERY?

13:00.780 --> 13:02.813
LET'S JUST SEE
WHAT HIS M.R.I. SAYS.

13:02.813 --> 13:04.815
(indistinct conversations,
telephone ringing)

13:04.815 --> 13:06.917
FUNNY THING.

13:06.917 --> 13:08.258
I DIDN'T ORDER AN N.G. TUBE.

13:08.258 --> 13:10.120
DID YOU HEAR ME ORDER
AN N.G. TUBE, DR. WEBBER?

13:10.120 --> 13:11.321
NO.

13:11.321 --> 13:12.923
I--
SO YOU CAN IMAGINE
OUR SURPRISE

13:12.923 --> 13:16.326
WHEN A NURSE BROUGHT ONE IN,
ALONG WITH A FEEDING PUMP.

13:16.326 --> 13:18.869
DR. WEBBER WORRIED THAT I HAD
CHANGED HIS COURSE OF TREATMENT

13:18.869 --> 13:19.799
WITHOUT CONSULTING HIM.

13:19.799 --> 13:20.931
DR. BAILEY--

13:20.931 --> 13:22.132
I TOLD HIM I DID NOT.

13:22.132 --> 13:24.935
SO THEN WE GOT TO THINKING
ABOUT WHO, PERHAPS,

13:24.935 --> 13:26.907
COULD HAVE ORDERED
THESE THINGS,

13:26.907 --> 13:28.208
AND YOUR NAME CAME UP.

13:28.208 --> 13:29.479
I WAS TRYING
TO BE PROACTIVE.

13:29.479 --> 13:31.942
IN CASE REPLETING
HIS ELECTROLYTES DOESN'T WORK--

13:31.942 --> 13:33.813
(raspy voice)
YOU WANNA BE PROACTIVE?

13:33.813 --> 13:36.416
(sighs)

13:36.416 --> 13:37.587
GET ME SOME SOUP.

13:39.890 --> 13:41.121
YOU HEARD THE MAN.

13:43.593 --> 13:45.856
HEY, WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"NO PRO BONO SURGERIES"?

13:45.856 --> 13:48.098
ALL--ALL FUNDS ARE BEING
REALLOCATED TO STORM REPAIR

13:48.098 --> 13:49.860
UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.
(squeaking)

13:49.860 --> 13:51.301
WHAT? WHO SAID THAT?

13:51.301 --> 13:53.833
THE BOARD DID, SO...
YOU.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.235
(elevator bell dings,
squeaking resumes)

13:55.235 --> 13:56.967
ALL RIGHT, WELL, MY LADY'S
FACIAL RECONSTRUCTION SURGERY

13:56.967 --> 13:58.939
WAS BOOKED
WAY BEFORE THE STORM.

13:58.939 --> 14:00.610
(marker clatters)
SHE TEACHES KINDERGARTEN.

14:00.610 --> 14:02.042
AVERY,
I DON'T MAKE THE RULES.

14:02.042 --> 14:03.914
I JUST GET TO BE
THE BAD COP HERE.

14:03.914 --> 14:05.275
SO THEN I'LL JUST
HAVE THE BOARD MEET,

14:05.275 --> 14:07.017
AND THEY'RE GONNA APPROVE IT.

14:07.017 --> 14:08.578
WELL, THAT'S GONNA BE TRICKY
SINCE EVERYONE ON THE BOARD

14:08.578 --> 14:10.320
HAS THEIR OWN PRO BONOS
THAT THEY WANNA DO.

14:10.320 --> 14:12.622
SO WHEN YOU ALL GET TOGETHER,
MAYBE COME FIND ME

14:12.622 --> 14:15.956
AND TELL ME HOW YOU PLAN TO FUND
REPAIRING THE OUTPATIENT O.R.

14:15.956 --> 14:17.557
SO WE'RE NOT DROWNING
IN PATIENTS.

14:17.557 --> 14:20.090
COME ON. WE'RE GONNA GET TO THAT
WHEN THINGS SLOW DOWN.

14:20.090 --> 14:22.032
THINGS WON'T SLOW DOWN
UNTIL WE GET TO IT.

14:22.032 --> 14:23.593
WELL, IF YOU'D LET ME FINISH
MY RECONSTRUCTION SURGERY--

14:23.593 --> 14:26.136
AVERY, WE DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY
FOR THIS SURGERY.

14:26.136 --> 14:28.368
LISTEN TO ME. ALL DUE RESPECT,
YOU SAID IT YOURSELF--

14:28.368 --> 14:30.140
YOU DON'T MAKE THE RULES.
I DO.

14:30.140 --> 14:33.173
NOW CARA McADAMS--THAT PRO BONO
IS NOT GONNA BE CANCELED.

14:33.173 --> 14:35.375
I NEED YOU TO BE A GOOD COP,
A TRAFFIC COP.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.947
UH, I'M SORRY?

14:36.947 --> 14:38.348
MOVE SOME PATIENTS AROUND.

14:38.348 --> 14:39.950
IF WE'RE OVERLOADED, THEN
TRANSFER THEM TO SEATTLE PRES.

14:39.950 --> 14:41.381
I DON'T CARE.
BUT MAKE SOME ROOM.

14:41.381 --> 14:42.882
(breathes deeply)

14:42.882 --> 14:44.884
YES, SIR.
(marker clatters)

14:46.456 --> 14:48.458
So I'm waiting
on the kid's MRI,

14:48.458 --> 14:50.090
and if it's too crappy,

14:50.090 --> 14:51.191
I HAVE TO PUT HIM
ON THE TRANSPLANT LIST

14:51.191 --> 14:53.463
AND NO SURGERY.
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

14:53.463 --> 14:55.295
I THINK HE WENT TO THE STORE

14:55.295 --> 14:58.328
AND TOOK A NAP
IN THE PARKING LOT.

14:58.328 --> 14:59.599
WHERE'S MY NAP, CRISTINA?

14:59.599 --> 15:00.900
I DON'T KNOW.
I DIDN'T STEAL YOUR NAP.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.272
I'm sorry.

15:02.272 --> 15:05.275
IT'S JUST MY BOOBS HURT
AND THEY'RE COVERED IN LANOLIN

15:05.275 --> 15:06.576
and I smell like
an old couch.

15:06.576 --> 15:09.439
OKAY. GOT EYES ON WEBBER.

15:09.439 --> 15:10.981
NO N.G. TUBE.

15:10.981 --> 15:12.482
DAMN IT, SHANE.

15:12.482 --> 15:14.584
I ALMOST TOUCHED
HIS ARM TODAY.

15:14.584 --> 15:15.585
Webber's?

15:15.585 --> 15:17.117
NO. OWEN'S.

15:17.117 --> 15:18.518
HE'S SO STRESSED OUT
ABOUT THE HOSPITAL,

15:18.518 --> 15:19.950
AND I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW,

15:19.950 --> 15:22.022
I'D OFFER SOME SUPPORT
AND TOUCH HIS ARM.

15:22.022 --> 15:24.594
BUT... YOU KNOW,
YOU TOUCH HIS ARM

15:24.594 --> 15:26.126
AND THEN YOU'RE IN BED,

15:26.126 --> 15:27.657
AND THEN...

15:27.657 --> 15:29.599
NOTHING'S CHANGED.

15:29.599 --> 15:32.562
(tablet chimes)
OH, CRAP. HOLD ON.

15:32.562 --> 15:34.334
I GOT MY VALVE KID'S M.R.I.

15:34.334 --> 15:35.505
MER?

15:35.505 --> 15:37.467
(shower continues running)

15:37.467 --> 15:39.269
MER?

15:40.670 --> 15:42.412
OH, BIG HELP.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.077
(Bailey wailing)

15:47.077 --> 15:49.049
THE SHOWER WORKS BETTER
WHEN YOU'RE IN IT.

15:49.049 --> 15:52.022
(continues wailing)

15:52.022 --> 15:55.525
OHH. HE'S HUNGRY, AND MY NIPPLES
ARE NO USE TO HIM.

15:55.525 --> 15:57.127
I KNOW.

15:57.127 --> 15:58.488
(Bailey crying)

15:58.488 --> 16:00.190
DID YOU SEE
THE LOOK ON HER FACE

16:00.190 --> 16:01.661
WHEN YOU SHOWED HER
THAT PICTURE?
(laughs)

16:01.661 --> 16:03.593
I JUST--I WANNA SEE THAT LOOK
ON HER NEW FACE.

16:03.593 --> 16:05.365
I'M GLAD CHIEF HUNT
CAME AROUND.

16:05.365 --> 16:07.467
I MADE SURE HE GOT THE MESSAGE
THAT I AM DOING THE SURGERY

16:07.467 --> 16:10.570
WHETHER HE LIKES IT OR NOT.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.572
WHERE IS MRS. McADAMS?

16:12.572 --> 16:14.974
SHE WAS MOVED OUT
BY CHIEF HUNT.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.277
(elevator bell dings)

16:17.277 --> 16:19.609
I DON'T THINK
HE GOT THE MESSAGE.

16:21.311 --> 16:22.482
OWEN?
MM?

16:22.482 --> 16:24.014
WHY DO YOU KEEP RESCHEDULING
MY SURGERIES?

16:24.014 --> 16:25.485
WELL, LET'S HAVE A BOARD
MEETING, AND I'LL TELL YOU.

16:25.485 --> 16:26.656
WHY CAN'T YOU TELL ME
RIGHT NOW?

16:26.656 --> 16:28.388
BECAUSE I'M BUSY
RESCHEDULING SURGERIES.

16:28.388 --> 16:29.419
(scoffs) WHY?!

16:29.419 --> 16:30.990
OWEN?
MM?

16:30.990 --> 16:32.362
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT A PURCHASING
FREEZE ON THE NICU BUDGET?

16:32.362 --> 16:35.065
GOOD. I HAVE TWO OF YOU HERE.
AT LEAST MAYBE WE COULD...

16:35.065 --> 16:36.266
OH. OKAY.
(sighs) HEY.

16:36.266 --> 16:37.467
WE'RE NOT BUYING
THE BABIES JEWELRY.

16:37.467 --> 16:39.129
WE'RE BUYING THEM MEDICINE.

16:39.129 --> 16:40.200
RIGHT NOW, WE'RE LOW
ON NICU BLANKETS.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.531
THAT'S BABY BLANKETS.

16:41.531 --> 16:43.133
DON'T TELL ME.
TELL THE BOARD!

16:43.133 --> 16:46.036
HUNT, WHERE DID MY PRO BONO GO?

16:46.036 --> 16:47.777
WELL, I TOOK YOUR ADVICE
ABOUT TRANSFERS...

16:47.777 --> 16:50.380
MM-HMM.
SO I FOUND SOMEONE
AT SEATTLE PRES WHO COULD DO IT.

16:50.380 --> 16:51.411
THAT IS MY PATIENT.

16:51.411 --> 16:53.413
NOT ANYMORE.
YOUR PATIENT IS, UH...

16:53.413 --> 16:55.415
LET'S SEE...
A GLUTEAL LIPOSUCTION?

16:55.415 --> 16:56.746
(scoffs)
WITH TWO LIPOS AFTER THAT.

16:56.746 --> 16:58.688
YOU CAN'T JUST
FILL MY DAY WITH--
OF COURSE I CAN.

16:58.688 --> 17:00.320
IT'S WHAT
A TRAFFIC COP DOES.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.021
(elevator bell dings)

17:02.021 --> 17:03.293
GLUTEAL LIPO. SO THAT'S--

17:03.293 --> 17:05.095
SUCKING BUTT FAT.
(whispers) YEAH.

17:05.095 --> 17:07.097
(suction gurgling)
IS THAT PART OF THE LOGO?

17:07.097 --> 17:08.628
IT'S GOTTA BE
THE SOURCE OF ALL THIS BLOOD.

17:08.628 --> 17:10.300
(April) NOPE. THERE'S BLOOD
COMING FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE,

17:10.300 --> 17:12.232
SUPERIORLY.

17:12.232 --> 17:15.465
(sighs) WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
EXTEND THIS INCISION. SCALPEL?
(man) SCALPEL.

17:15.465 --> 17:17.107
(instrument clatters)

17:17.107 --> 17:19.209
SO I DON'T HAVE TO
TELL DANTE, RIGHT?

17:19.209 --> 17:21.141
I MEAN, I CAN JUST FORGET
THAT SHE SAID IT?
MURPHY--

17:21.141 --> 17:22.312
'CAUSE
THE BROTHER'S HERE NOW,

17:22.312 --> 17:23.443
AND IT'LL JUST IGNITE
A FAMILY FEUD.

17:23.443 --> 17:24.644
AND MAYBE I HEARD HER WRONG.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.376
WHAT ELSE
SOUNDS LIKE "BROTHER"?

17:26.376 --> 17:27.617
(instrument clatters)
"MOTHER"?

17:27.617 --> 17:29.749
OH, GOD.
SHE'S GONNA LIVE, OKAY?

17:29.749 --> 17:32.182
NO. I KNOW.

17:32.182 --> 17:33.583
(monitor beeping steadily)

17:33.583 --> 17:36.226
IT'S JUST, THERE'S A BIG BLEEDER
THAT WE HAVEN'T FOUND YET.

17:36.226 --> 17:37.757
MURPHY!

17:37.757 --> 17:41.431
(suction continues gurgling)

17:45.435 --> 17:49.369
(monitor beeping steadily)

17:49.369 --> 17:52.102
(plastic rustles)

17:59.849 --> 18:03.453
(swallows loudly)

18:03.453 --> 18:05.315
(whispers) ARE YOU GONNA
WATCH ME EAT?

18:05.315 --> 18:08.358
NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT.

18:15.495 --> 18:17.467
(spoon clatters)

18:36.346 --> 18:38.818
(sputters and coughs)

18:38.818 --> 18:40.190
(grunts)

18:40.190 --> 18:42.452
(breathes raggedly)

18:50.730 --> 18:52.402
HEY.

18:52.402 --> 18:54.164
HEY.

18:54.164 --> 18:55.335
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

18:55.335 --> 18:57.437
SCAVENGING.
NICU's LOW ON BLANKETS.

18:57.437 --> 18:58.668
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

18:58.668 --> 19:00.440
I HAVE A PAINFUL ERECTION
THAT WON'T SUBSIDE.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.912
(elevator bell dings)
OH. NOT... PFFT. NOT ME.

19:02.912 --> 19:04.374
UH, CARDS.

19:04.374 --> 19:05.315
HUH. OH.

19:05.315 --> 19:07.417
MY CONDITION IS PRIAPISM.

19:07.417 --> 19:09.879
MAJOR CAUSES ARE SICKLE CELL

19:09.879 --> 19:12.151
AND...

19:12.151 --> 19:13.323
CRAP.

19:13.323 --> 19:14.484
LEUKEMIA.

19:14.484 --> 19:16.256
I HOPE IT GOES AWAY SOON.

19:16.256 --> 19:18.328
MM. UM... HEY.

19:18.328 --> 19:19.589
UH, YOU KNOW,

19:19.589 --> 19:22.362
MM, YOU CAN KICK MY FRIENDS OUT
IF YOU WANT TO.

19:22.362 --> 19:23.493
I MEAN, IT'S YOUR HOUSE.

19:23.493 --> 19:25.665
THEY SHOULDN'T BE THERE
ALL THE TIME.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.367
NO. HEY, UH... (sighs)

19:27.367 --> 19:29.199
YOUR--YOUR FRIEND DIED
A WEEK AGO.

19:29.199 --> 19:32.402
YOU GUYS SHOULD HANG OUT
OR WHATEVER.

19:32.402 --> 19:33.903
YEAH.

19:33.903 --> 19:35.645
UNLESS YOU'RE OVER IT
ALREADY.

19:35.645 --> 19:39.479
NO. I MEAN, I'M--I'M STILL
REALLY SAD. OF COURSE.

19:39.479 --> 19:40.950
BUT, UH... UM...

19:40.950 --> 19:42.652
LOOK, I GET IT.

19:42.652 --> 19:43.853
I... (sighs)

19:43.853 --> 19:46.816
I MEAN, THEY CAN CRASH
HOWEVER LONG THEY WANT.

19:46.816 --> 19:49.959
YOU'RE BEING REALLY GREAT
ABOUT THIS.

19:49.959 --> 19:53.463
REALLY, REALLY GREAT.

19:53.463 --> 19:54.594
(sighs deeply)
(chuckles)

19:57.467 --> 19:58.598
(door opens and closes)

19:58.598 --> 20:00.470
(stomps feet)
(grunts) UGH!

20:00.470 --> 20:02.502
(film rattles)

20:02.502 --> 20:04.574
(telephone ringing in distance)

20:04.574 --> 20:06.606
(indistinct conversations)

20:06.606 --> 20:07.777
(sighs)

20:07.777 --> 20:08.938
(clatter)

20:08.938 --> 20:10.510
YOUR MITRAL VALVE REPLACEMENT?

20:10.510 --> 20:14.384
YEAH. A 17-YEAR-OLD INFANT HEART
TRANSPLANT RECIPIENT.

20:14.384 --> 20:15.415
(tablet beeps)

20:15.415 --> 20:17.216
KAREV DOESN'T THINK
I SHOULD DO IT.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.388
(sighs deeply)

20:18.388 --> 20:19.689
HIS E.F.'s ONLY 25%.

20:19.689 --> 20:21.451
YEAH, IT SUCKS.

20:21.451 --> 20:22.792
AND THERE IS A LOT OF SCARRING
TO GET THROUGH.

20:22.792 --> 20:24.324
KAREV IS RIGHT.

20:24.324 --> 20:26.996
THIS KID SHOULD GO
STRAIGHT ON THE TRANSPLANT LIST.

20:26.996 --> 20:28.358
(sighs)

20:28.358 --> 20:29.829
IT'S RISKY,

20:29.829 --> 20:31.831
BUT THE PARENTS WANT IT,
AND SO DOES THE KID.

20:31.831 --> 20:34.304
(chuckles)

20:34.304 --> 20:35.935
SOUND LIKE YOU'RE GONNA
GO AHEAD THEN.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.867
YEAH.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.410
WELL, GOOD LUCK.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.673
THANKS.

20:46.646 --> 20:48.478
WHAT?

20:50.249 --> 20:53.353
NORMALLY, I'D KISS YOU.

20:53.353 --> 20:56.356
I'D WISH YOU LUCK
AND THEN I'D KISS YOU.

20:58.458 --> 21:00.360
HEY, YOU GUYS DID
COUPLES THERAPY, RIGHT?

21:00.360 --> 21:01.591
WAS IT GOOD? DID IT HELP?

21:01.591 --> 21:03.433
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY NOT, RIGHT?
LOOK AT YOU GUYS.

21:03.433 --> 21:04.534
UH, NO OFFENSE.

21:04.534 --> 21:06.566
OFFENSE.
(telephone ringing in distance)

21:06.566 --> 21:09.499
WELL... (scoffs)

21:09.499 --> 21:10.800
(cell phone buzzes and beeps)

21:10.800 --> 21:12.041
TORRES.

21:12.041 --> 21:13.773
(monitor beeping erratically)

21:13.773 --> 21:15.405
WHAT?!

21:15.405 --> 21:18.508
THE ONLY WAY? NO, NO, NO.
NO, YOU DON'T CUT THE CLAVICLE!

21:18.508 --> 21:20.480
NO, DON'T DO THAT WITHOUT ME!

21:20.480 --> 21:22.412
Why would you do that?!
BECAUSE THE SUBCLAVIAN'S
BLEEDING LIKE STINK,

21:22.412 --> 21:24.384
AND WE CAN'T GET TO IT.
SHE'S BLEEDING OUT!

21:24.384 --> 21:26.486
AND SHE'S BLEEDING OUT.
(elevator bell dings)

21:26.486 --> 21:27.657
UGH.

21:27.657 --> 21:29.859
OKAY, EVERYBODY OUT.
(woman) WHAT?

21:29.859 --> 21:31.661
EVERYBODY OUT. GET OUT.
GET OUT NOW! NOW!
WHY? WHAT?

21:31.661 --> 21:32.722
Come on, get out! Come on!

21:32.722 --> 21:34.564
GET OUT! COME ON!
(people murmuring)

21:34.564 --> 21:37.397
(pushes button)
YOU DO NOT CUT A CLAVICLE
YOURSELVES!

21:37.397 --> 21:38.768
NO! NO!

21:38.768 --> 21:40.770
(pushes button)

21:40.770 --> 21:42.832
SHE SAYS "NO."
I DON'T THINK I HAVE A CHOICE.

21:42.832 --> 21:44.303
She doesn't have--
I CAN HEAR HER!
TELL HER I'M ON MY WAY!

21:44.303 --> 21:45.335
She's on her way.

21:45.335 --> 21:46.536
EXCUSE ME!
WHOA!

21:46.536 --> 21:48.338
(suction continues gurgling)

21:48.338 --> 21:49.509
(sighs)
(monitor continues
beeping rapidly)

21:49.509 --> 21:51.781
WHAT DO WE DO?
(man) B.P.'s DROPPING.

21:51.781 --> 21:53.483
GIVE ME THE SAW.
(woman) HERE YOU GO.

21:54.884 --> 21:59.719
(whirring)

22:01.050 --> 22:02.452
(panting)

22:02.452 --> 22:03.623
(whirring stops)

22:03.623 --> 22:05.425
OH, GOD.

22:05.425 --> 22:07.897
WHAT THE HELL DID YOU JUST DO?!

22:11.831 --> 22:12.862
WHAT PART OF
"DON'T CUT THE CLAVICLE"

22:12.862 --> 22:14.033
DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND?
I FIXED IT.

22:14.033 --> 22:15.104
MASSIVE BLEEDER
JUST UNDER THE RIGHT--

22:15.104 --> 22:16.636
YOU MADE A CLEAN CUT
DOWN THE MIDDLE.

22:16.636 --> 22:17.967
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW DIFFICULT IT IS

22:17.967 --> 22:19.909
TO REPAIR BONE WITH
THIS LITTLE SURFACE AREA?

22:19.909 --> 22:22.011
THERE WAS NO WAY TO DO
THE REPAIR WITHOUT VISIBILITY.

22:22.011 --> 22:23.973
MM, NO, THERE WAS NO EASY WAY.

22:23.973 --> 22:25.715
AND BECAUSE YOU'RE CARELESS
AND THOUGHTLESS,

22:25.715 --> 22:26.976
THAT SEEMED PROHIBITIVE TO YOU.

22:26.976 --> 22:28.578
YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST DO

22:28.578 --> 22:30.349
WHATEVER YOU FEEL LIKE IN
THE MOMENT, AND ORTHO WILL JUST

22:30.349 --> 22:31.881
PUT EVERYTHING BACK
THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.
SHE WAS DYING!

22:31.881 --> 22:33.923
NO, JUST GO.
LET ME CLEAN UP YOUR MESS.

22:34.924 --> 22:37.457
COME ON.

22:37.457 --> 22:38.928
(sighs deeply)

22:38.928 --> 22:40.129
PROMISE ME
IF IT LOOKS TOO GNARLY

22:40.129 --> 22:41.991
YOU'LL JUST CLOSE HIM UP.

22:41.991 --> 22:44.133
WILL YOU STOP
WRINGING YOUR HANDS?

22:44.133 --> 22:47.397
GOD. NO WONDER
YOU CAN'T HAVE SEX.
I CAN HAVE SEX.

22:51.070 --> 22:54.073
I CAN HAVE SEX.

22:54.073 --> 22:56.906
ARE THE HYDRAULICS NOT WORKING?
I CAN WRITE YOU A SCRIPT.

22:56.906 --> 22:59.649
LOOK, THAT'S NOT...
SHE'S JUST...

22:59.649 --> 23:02.682
BUMMED ABOUT HER DEAD FRIEND
AND STRESSED ABOUT HER EXAMS.

23:02.682 --> 23:04.083
UGH. THOSE ARE NOT VALID.

23:04.083 --> 23:06.015
ALL RIGHT. THERE'S BEEN
A LOT OF GIRLS SINCE IZZIE.

23:06.015 --> 23:07.386
A LOT OF NOBODIES.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.118
MM-HMM.
BUT THIS GIRL
IS NOT A NOBODY.

23:09.118 --> 23:11.090
SHE'S... I DON'T KNOW.
WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT,

23:11.090 --> 23:12.892
IT JUST SEEMS IMPORTANT.
LIKE...

23:12.892 --> 23:14.994
LIKE IT'S GOTTA BE
THE RIGHT TIME.

23:16.526 --> 23:17.897
YOU WANT IT TO BE SPECIAL.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.028
WHAT?
NOTHING.

23:19.028 --> 23:20.029
IT'S SWEET.

23:20.029 --> 23:21.931
ARE YOU MAKING FUN OF ME?

23:21.931 --> 23:23.433
I AM NOT.

23:23.433 --> 23:26.576
(suction gurgling)

23:26.576 --> 23:28.908
CAN I ASK YOU ONE THING?
WHEN WE'RE DONE HERE,

23:28.908 --> 23:30.940
WILL YOU BRAID MY HAIR?

23:30.940 --> 23:33.743
(laughs)

23:33.743 --> 23:35.445
(bovie sizzles)

23:35.445 --> 23:37.617
(clicks tongue) OH, BOY.

23:37.617 --> 23:39.418
MM.

23:39.418 --> 23:41.491
LAST CHANCE TO TURN BACK.

23:43.422 --> 23:44.824
SCISSORS.

23:44.824 --> 23:47.196
(woman) HERE YOU GO.

23:47.196 --> 23:49.799
OF COURSE I PISSED HIM OFF.

23:49.799 --> 23:51.060
BUT TRANSFERRING MY PATIENT
TO SOME OTHER HOSPITAL

23:51.060 --> 23:53.463
JUST TO SPITE ME?
SEEMS EXTREME.

23:53.463 --> 23:55.004
YEAH, HE CAN'T DO IT.
YEAH, HE CAN. HE'S YOUR BOSS.

23:55.004 --> 23:57.867
NO. I'M HIS BOSS.
RIGHT? THE BOARD IS HIS BOSS.

23:57.867 --> 23:58.938
THAT'S A JACKED UP SYSTEM.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.670
THE SYSTEM IS ACTUALLY FINE.

24:00.670 --> 24:01.971
IT'S JUST IN THIS PARTICULAR
SITUATION, IT BECOMES--

24:01.971 --> 24:04.013
JACKED UP?
COMPLICATED.

24:04.013 --> 24:07.146
YOU KNOW WHAT'S NOT COMPLICATED?
THIS.

24:07.146 --> 24:08.518
UNLESS I'M MISSING SOMETHING,

24:08.518 --> 24:10.049
YOU JUST SUCK THE FAT
WITH THAT HOSE.

24:10.049 --> 24:11.450
WELL, PRETTY--PRETTY MUCH.

24:11.450 --> 24:13.553
OKAY. AND THE NEXT LIPO
WILL BE JUST LIKE THIS?

24:13.553 --> 24:14.884
OH, IT'S GONNA BE
A DIFFERENT BUTT ENTIRELY.

24:14.884 --> 24:16.025
DO YOU REALLY NEED ME HERE?

24:16.025 --> 24:17.226
'CAUSE EVERYONE ELSE
IS STUDYING.

24:17.226 --> 24:18.988
YOU SAID SOMETHING ABOUT
BEING WITH ME ALL DAY.

24:18.988 --> 24:20.660
THOUGHT WE WERE
CHANGING LIVES?

24:20.660 --> 24:25.695
YEAH, BUT I ALSO WANTED TO SEE
THE LOOK ON OUR PATIENT'S FACE.

24:25.695 --> 24:28.467
GET OUT OF HERE.
(laughs) THANKS!

24:29.999 --> 24:31.140
(closes door)

24:31.140 --> 24:32.872
IS HE ASLEEP?

24:32.872 --> 24:34.844
NO. HE HATES SLEEP.

24:34.844 --> 24:36.906
HE'S STARING AT THE MOBILE.

24:36.906 --> 24:39.879
MMM.

24:39.879 --> 24:42.782
I DON'T KNOW HOW
SUCH A LITTLE KID...
(sighs deeply)

24:42.782 --> 24:44.984

24:44.984 --> 24:47.056
I DON'T KNOW.

24:49.058 --> 24:50.059
ARE YOU ASLEEP?
NO.

24:50.059 --> 24:51.621
NOBODY'S ASLEEP.
ARE YOU ASLEEP?

24:51.621 --> 24:53.923
NO, I'M TOO WORRIED
ABOUT RICHARD TO SLEEP.

24:53.923 --> 24:55.094
HE NEEDS AN N.G. TUBE,

24:55.094 --> 24:56.566
AND OF COURSE
HE DOESN'T WANT ONE.

24:56.566 --> 24:59.168
AND HE'S INTIMIDATING BAILEY
INTO NOT ORDERING ONE.

24:59.168 --> 25:01.901
BUT THAT'S WHAT HE NEEDS.

25:01.901 --> 25:05.875
HE MADE ME HIS FAMILY,
AND THEN I ABANDONED HIM.

25:05.875 --> 25:08.708
IT'S JUST A MESS OVER THERE.

29:32.241 --> 29:34.073

29:53.993 --> 29:55.224
AND I'M DOING

29:55.224 --> 29:56.395
AND THE BOARD IS GONNA
DISCUSS YOUR BEHAVIOR.

29:56.395 --> 29:59.028
AVERY, AVERY, LOOK.

29:59.028 --> 30:01.400
SHE'S ALL SET FOR YOU
FIRST THING TOMORROW.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.332
YOU SAID
YOU TRANSFERRED HER.

30:03.332 --> 30:04.573
MM-HMM. I LIED.

30:04.573 --> 30:06.035
YOU LIED?
YEAH, I-I JUST MOVED HER.

30:06.035 --> 30:07.576
SO THAT MEANS YOU DECIDED
THAT THREE LIPOSUCTIONS

30:07.576 --> 30:09.008
WERE MORE IMPORTANT
THAN THIS LADY'S FACIAL RE--

30:09.008 --> 30:10.379

30:10.379 --> 30:13.843

30:29.899 --> 30:31.460

30:41.871 --> 30:44.914
I CAN'T FORCE YOU TO--
NO, NO. YOU CAN.

30:44.914 --> 30:47.476
YOU'RE OUR BOSS,
AND YOU CAN LIE.

IT'S FINE.

30:56.255 --> 30:57.927
YOU GOTTA GET OVER THIS
"SPECIAL" THING.

30:57.927 --> 30:59.458
JUST THROW HER OVER
YOUR SHOULDER,

30:59.458 --> 31:01.290
TAKE HER TO BED,
AND GO TO TOWN.

31:01.290 --> 31:02.491

31:02.491 --> 31:07.296

31:07.296 --> 31:09.568

RIGHT THERE.

31:09.568 --> 31:10.900
YOU BOTH WANT THE SAME THING.

31:10.900 --> 31:12.571

DON'T GO TOO DEEP.

31:12.571 --> 31:14.473

31:14.473 --> 31:17.606
THIS FAMILY IS NOT SCARED.
THIS BOY IS NOT SCARED.

31:17.606 --> 31:19.508
I AM NOT DOING THIS
BECAUSE I WANT TO.

31:19.508 --> 31:20.879
I'M DOING THIS BECAUSE
THEY ASKED ME TO

31:20.879 --> 31:23.612

31:23.612 --> 31:26.615

COMING CLOSER.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.993
IF I KEEP PUSHING,
I'LL SEND HIM INTO V-FIB.

31:33.993 --> 31:35.494
EVEN CANNULATING
WILL DESTROY THE HEART

31:35.494 --> 31:37.896

31:37.896 --> 31:41.300
YOU WIN.

31:57.516 --> 31:59.318
STILL HAVEN'T HEARD?

31:59.318 --> 32:01.650

LAST YEAR,

32:01.650 --> 32:03.222
I FOUND OUT BEFORE
I GOT HOME THAT NIGHT.

32:03.222 --> 32:05.524
IT'S BEEN 48 HOURS,
AND NOTHING.

32:05.524 --> 32:06.695
(sighs)

32:06.695 --> 32:08.297
I THINK IF YOU FAIL TWICE,

32:08.297 --> 32:09.999
THEY JUST STOP TALKING TO YOU
AND HOPE YOU GET THE HINT.

32:09.999 --> 32:12.631
I'M PRETTY SURE
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS.
(smartphone chimes)
