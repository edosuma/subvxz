WEBVTT

00:12.433 --> 00:14.500
PREVIOUSLY
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:14.533 --> 00:16.133
I DID A TERRIBLE THING.

00:16.167 --> 00:19.233
SLEEPING WITH ME, IS IT
THIS AWFUL FOR YOU?
NO, GEORGE!

00:19.267 --> 00:20.833
I GREW MY HAIR FOR HER.

00:20.867 --> 00:22.267
I COULD BE YOUR FRIEND,
MEREDITH.

00:22.300 --> 00:24.600
WHY DO YOU THINK
SHE CHEATED ON YOU?

00:24.633 --> 00:26.233
I WAS JUST A LITTLE ABSENT.

00:26.267 --> 00:29.100
GIVE ME A CALL WHEN YOU
GET BACK IN TOWN.

00:29.133 --> 00:30.367
I THOUGHT WE HAD PLANS
FOR TONIGHT.

00:30.400 --> 00:32.767
NOT EXACTLY HOW I ENVISIONED
OUR FIRST DATE.

00:32.800 --> 00:35.533
CAN WE PLEASE JUST GO BACK
TO EVERYTHING THE WAY IT WAS?

00:35.567 --> 00:37.600
I DON'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE.
(Preston) HE'S YOUR FRIEND

00:37.633 --> 00:39.767
AND HE NEEDED OUR HELP.
GOOD NIGHT.

00:39.800 --> 00:41.067
OH, GOOD NIGHT.

00:41.100 --> 00:43.300
GOOD NIGHT.

00:44.867 --> 00:48.000
***

00:50.800 --> 00:52.500
(Meredith) AS DOCTORS,

00:52.533 --> 00:56.733
PATIENTS ARE ALWAYS TELLING US
HOW THEY WOULD DO OUR JOBS.

00:56.767 --> 01:00.333
***

01:00.367 --> 01:02.633
"JUST STITCH ME UP,
SLAP A BAND-AID ON IT

01:02.667 --> 01:05.100
AND SEND ME HOME."

01:05.133 --> 01:06.800
***

01:06.833 --> 01:08.100
(barking)

01:08.133 --> 01:10.167
IT'S EASY TO SUGGEST
A QUICK SOLUTION

01:10.200 --> 01:12.100
WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW MUCH
ABOUT THE PROBLEM,

01:12.133 --> 01:14.167
WHEN YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
THE UNDERLYING CAUSE

01:14.200 --> 01:17.367
OR JUST HOW DEEP
THE WOUND REALLY IS.

01:17.400 --> 01:20.433
SO YOUR FRIENDS--
ARE THEY STILL MAD ABOUT THIS

01:20.467 --> 01:22.333
VERY BAD,
HORRIBLE THING YOU DID?

01:22.367 --> 01:24.700
THE VERY HORRIBLE, BAD THING
THAT I WON'T TELL YOU ABOUT?

01:24.733 --> 01:26.233
YES, THEY'RE STILL UPSET.

01:26.267 --> 01:28.267
WELL, WHATEVER IT IS,
DON'T TELL ME.

01:28.300 --> 01:30.433
EVEN IF I BEG,
DON'T TELL ME.

01:30.467 --> 01:31.767
OKAY, I WON'T.
GOOD.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.233
OKAY. ALTHOUGH,
WE ARE FRIENDS.

01:34.267 --> 01:36.167
TRUE, WE ARE FRIENDS.
TECHNICALLY, YOU TELL
A FRIEND STUFF.

01:36.200 --> 01:38.833
YOU COME TO ME WITH A PROBLEM,
AND I'LL GIVE YOU THE ANSWER.

01:38.867 --> 01:40.600
AFTER, MAYBE WE CELEBRATE

01:40.633 --> 01:42.300
THE MOMENTS OF OUR LIVES.

01:42.333 --> 01:44.233
I WILL KEEP THAT IN MIND
NEXT TIME I DO

01:44.267 --> 01:46.433
A HORRIBLE THING.
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

01:46.467 --> 01:49.333
DON'T YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS
YOU WANT TO TELL ME ABOUT?
TRUTHFULLY?

01:49.367 --> 01:52.233
AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME,
I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS.

01:52.267 --> 01:54.333
NOT A SINGLE ONE.

01:54.367 --> 01:57.233
***

01:57.267 --> 01:59.267
THE FIRST STEP
TOWARD A REAL CURE

01:59.300 --> 02:01.600
IS TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT
THE DISEASE IS TO BEGIN WITH--

02:01.633 --> 02:03.533
BUT THAT'S NOT
WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO HEAR.

02:03.567 --> 02:05.067
MORNING.

02:05.100 --> 02:07.500
H-HOW MANY MILES
WAS THAT, DR. BURKE?

02:07.533 --> 02:09.167
(Preston) 5.

02:09.200 --> 02:11.233
5. 5 MILES IN 50 MINUTES.

02:11.267 --> 02:13.467
NICE.
WE CAN GET IT
CLOSER TO 45.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.633
PANCAKES?
TOP OF THE CUPBOARD.

02:17.267 --> 02:21.067
***

02:22.367 --> 02:23.733
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR HAIR?

02:23.767 --> 02:25.567
(Preston)
LEAVE THE MAN ALONE.

02:25.600 --> 02:27.567
HE'S GOT ISSUES.

02:27.600 --> 02:29.833
***

02:29.867 --> 02:32.300
HE WANTS TO CUT HIS HAIR
TO GET OVER THOSE ISSUES,

02:32.333 --> 02:34.233
THAT'S HIS BUSINESS,
HIS THING.

02:34.267 --> 02:36.200
IT'S MY THING. COFFEE?

02:36.233 --> 02:37.167
CAPPUCCINO.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.167
CAPPUCCINO. EXCELLENT.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.267
CAPPUCCINO.
CAPPUCCINO.

02:41.300 --> 02:44.167
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO FORGET
THE PAST THAT LANDED US HERE,

02:44.200 --> 02:46.733
IGNORE THE FUTURE COMPLICATIONS
THAT MIGHT ARISE

02:46.767 --> 02:49.067
AND GO FOR THE QUICK FIX.

02:49.100 --> 02:51.833
***

02:51.867 --> 02:53.833
(Izzie) WHAT HAPPENED
TO GEORGE'S HAIR?

02:53.867 --> 02:56.300
IS HE HAVING
A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN?
BURKE SAYS
HE'S GOT "ISSUES."

02:56.333 --> 02:57.500
YOU SHOULD SEE THEM TOGETHER.

02:57.533 --> 02:59.433
THEY'RE, LIKE, DOING THINGS,
LIKE RUNNING

02:59.467 --> 03:01.133
AND COOKING AND TALKING.

03:01.167 --> 03:02.333
THEY'RE, LIKE, BONDING.

03:02.367 --> 03:04.333
AND YOU'RE AFRAID
THAT BURKE WILL REALIZE

03:04.367 --> 03:06.267
HE MAKES A BETTER GIRLFRIEND
THAN YOU?

03:06.300 --> 03:08.767
YOU KNOW, MEREDITH,
JUST GO AND APOLOGIZE TO HIM.
I'VE TRIED.

03:08.800 --> 03:10.700
TRY AGAIN.
THINGS CAN'T STAY LIKE THIS.

03:10.733 --> 03:13.067
THEY SUCK LIKE THIS.

03:13.100 --> 03:15.567
WHAT'S UP WITH O'MALLEY'S HAIR?
HE LOOKS LIKE A HOBBIT.

03:15.600 --> 03:17.533
HE'S JUST TRYING
A NEW LOOK.

03:17.567 --> 03:19.267
YOU NEVER CALLED ME BACK
LAST NIGHT. YOU AVOIDING ME?

03:19.300 --> 03:21.433
WHY WOULD I BE
AVOIDING YOU?

03:21.467 --> 03:23.200
(Izzie)
DENNY DUQUETTE, AGE 36--

03:23.233 --> 03:24.500
37 IN 3 WEEKS.

03:24.533 --> 03:27.233
37 IN 3 WEEKS,

03:27.267 --> 03:29.100
IS HAVING DIFFICULT BREATHING
AND CHEST PAINS.

03:29.133 --> 03:31.433
BREATH SOUNDS?
STILL A LITTLE JUNKY.

03:31.467 --> 03:33.100
HE HAS A BUILDUP OF FLUID
IN HIS SYSTEM.

03:33.133 --> 03:36.100
HEY, DID YOU JUST CALL ME
A JUNKIE? THAT'S NOT VERY NICE.

03:36.133 --> 03:38.733
DENNY, YOUR CONGESTIVE
HEART FAILURE IS GETTING WORSE

03:38.767 --> 03:40.467
DESPITE THE MEDS.

03:40.500 --> 03:43.667
ALL RIGHT.
SO HOW DO WE PROCEED?

03:43.700 --> 03:45.600
DOCTORS,
HOW DO WE PROCEED?

03:45.633 --> 03:48.333
TITRATE UP HIS NITRATE DRIP
AND CONTINUE WITH DIURETICS.

03:48.367 --> 03:50.133
ACE INHIBITORS,
BETA BLOCKERS

03:50.167 --> 03:51.533
AND START DOBUTAMINE.

03:51.567 --> 03:53.833
I ALSO WANT HIS INS
AND OUTS RECORDED,

03:53.867 --> 03:56.067
AND ONE OF YOU
MONITORING HIM AT ALL TIMES.

03:56.100 --> 03:57.800
I'LL STAY.
ME, TOO.

04:01.100 --> 04:03.533
(chuckles)

04:03.567 --> 04:07.433
MR. AND MRS. GIBSON,
I'M DR. MONTGOMERY-SHEPHERD.

04:07.467 --> 04:09.167
I'M GONNA BE COVERING
FOR DR. POLLACK.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.333
MRS. GIBSON HAD A PRETERM,
PREMATURE RUPTURE

04:11.367 --> 04:13.133
OF HER MEMBRANES
AT 28 WEEKS.

04:13.167 --> 04:14.533
SHE'S BEEN CONFINED
TO SUPERVISED BED REST

04:14.567 --> 04:17.367
FOR SEVEN WEEKS
AND HAS A LOW-GRADE FEVER.

04:17.400 --> 04:19.067
CAN'T YOU
JUST SCHEDULE A "C"?

04:19.067 --> 04:21.100
BELIEVE ME, I'M READY
TO HAVE THIS BABY.

04:21.133 --> 04:23.600
YEAH, YOU AND ME BOTH.
I WANT TO GET
YOUR BLOOD WORK BACK

04:23.633 --> 04:26.100
BEFORE WE MAKE
ANY FURTHER DECISIONS.

04:26.133 --> 04:28.500
I HAVE TO PEE... AGAIN.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.633
COME ON. HERE WE GO.

04:32.667 --> 04:34.200
GOT IT?

04:34.233 --> 04:36.300
I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING OVER
MY WIFE'S CASE.

04:36.333 --> 04:38.233
UH, DR. POLLOCK SAYS
YOU'RE THE BEST.

04:38.267 --> 04:40.167
OH, IT'S MY PLEASURE,
MR. GIBSON.

04:40.200 --> 04:41.700
HE DIDN'T MENTION
THAT, UH--

04:41.733 --> 04:43.633
WOW, I MEAN, YOU BEAR
A STRIKING RESEMBLANCE

04:43.667 --> 04:45.633
TO A YOUNG
CATHERINE DENEUVE.

04:45.667 --> 04:48.567
OH, YOU--YOU NEVER
HEARD THAT BEFORE?

04:48.600 --> 04:50.667
UH, UH, NO, I'M SORRY.

04:50.700 --> 04:52.167
I HAVE TO SAY,
IT'S A FIRST.

04:52.200 --> 04:53.800
BEEN TOLD I LOOK LIKE
HALLE BERRY.

04:53.833 --> 04:55.667
(Mr. Gibson) BEAUTIFUL.

04:55.700 --> 04:57.400
BEAUTIFUL.
WELL, MS. DENEUVE.

04:57.433 --> 05:00.200
OF COURSE, YOU--
YOU ARE, TOO, BUT...

05:00.233 --> 05:02.100
BY EXTENSION.

05:02.133 --> 05:04.067
RIGHT. WE'LL BE BACK,
UM, IN LATER

05:04.067 --> 05:05.833
TO CHECK ON YOUR WIFE.

05:05.867 --> 05:08.233
LOOK FORWARD TO IT.

05:08.267 --> 05:10.167
(pager beeps)

05:10.200 --> 05:11.700
(Tuck cries)
E.R. NEEDS A CONSULT.

05:11.733 --> 05:13.467
UH, O'MALLEY, GREY,

05:13.500 --> 05:15.400
WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD
AND TAKE THAT?
WHAT ABOUT MRS. GIBSON?

05:15.433 --> 05:17.067
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF MRS. GIBSON.

05:17.100 --> 05:18.833
YOU REALLY THINK
THEY NEED BOTH OF US?

05:18.867 --> 05:20.767
(Addison) I GUESS
YOU'LL FIND OUT. GO.

05:20.800 --> 05:23.267
ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE HIM
TO THE NURSERY?
UH, IT'S FULL.

05:23.300 --> 05:25.200
AND TUCKER'S OUT OF TOWN
TILL TOMORROW.

05:25.233 --> 05:27.067
YOU BROUGHT
YOUR BABY TO WORK?
COME HERE, SWEETIE.

05:27.100 --> 05:29.700
OKAY. YES, YES, YES.
UH, YES, CHIEF.

05:29.733 --> 05:31.233
YOU'RE NOT GONNA TAKE HIM
INTO SURGERY WITH YOU?

05:31.267 --> 05:33.800
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
SCHEDULED FOR TODAY.
YET.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.733
OKAY, I CAN'T SOLVE A PROBLEM
UNTIL THERE'S

05:35.767 --> 05:38.633
A PROBLEM TO SOLVE. ARE YOU
SAYING THERE'S A PROBLEM?

05:38.667 --> 05:40.767
IS THERE A PROBLEM,
RICHARD?

05:40.800 --> 05:42.733
NO.

05:47.267 --> 05:49.067
YOU KNOW,

05:49.100 --> 05:50.267
AT SOME POINT,

05:50.300 --> 05:52.333
YOU ARE GOING TO
HAVE TO TALK TO ME.

05:52.367 --> 05:56.067
I'M GONNA TAKE THE STAIRS.

06:00.733 --> 06:02.633
YOU PAGED?

06:02.667 --> 06:04.567
YEAH, JUST GOT
A NEW PATIENT.

06:04.600 --> 06:06.667
LOOKS SURGICAL,
MAYBE NEURO.

06:13.167 --> 06:15.067
IT DOESN'T LOOK NEURO
TO ME.
NOT HIM.

06:15.100 --> 06:17.400
OH, NO. I'M FINE.
IT'S MY WIFE.

06:17.433 --> 06:19.100
THIS IS SO EMBARRASSING,

06:19.133 --> 06:21.167
BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

06:36.600 --> 06:38.500
(man) WE WERE AT
THE HOTEL MONACO HAVING BRUNCH.

06:38.533 --> 06:40.667
WE HAD SOME MIMOSAS.
CAN WE JUST SKIP
THAT PART?

06:40.700 --> 06:43.767
CAN WE PULL THIS OUT
AND JUST GO? I'M FINE, REALLY.

06:43.800 --> 06:45.700
SYLVIA WAS GIVING ME
SOME SPECIAL ATTENTION...

06:45.733 --> 06:47.400
UNDER THE TABLE.

06:47.433 --> 06:49.567
OH, DEAR LORD.
OH, OKAY.

06:49.600 --> 06:52.233
SWEETIE, THEY'RE DOCTORS.
THEY'VE HEARD IT ALL.
YES, WE HAVE.

06:52.267 --> 06:54.767
ABSOLUTELY.
WHILE I WAS DOWN THERE,
SOMETHING HAPPENED.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.700
IT WAS LIKE A SHOCK
WENT THROUGH MY BODY.

06:56.733 --> 06:59.800
AND SHE... CLENCHED.

06:59.833 --> 07:01.733
CLENCHED?
MY JAW.

07:01.767 --> 07:03.567
IT JUST SHUT.

07:03.600 --> 07:05.200
OH, AND I PANICKED.

07:05.233 --> 07:06.600
OH, YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
WELL, I GRABBED THE FORK
OFF THE TABLE,

07:06.633 --> 07:08.733
AND IT WAS JUST INSTINCTUAL.

07:08.767 --> 07:10.133
IT DOESN'T HURT THAT MUCH.

07:10.167 --> 07:12.067
WE JUST DIDN'T WANT
TO PULL IT OUT

07:12.100 --> 07:14.300
'CAUSE IT'S IN THERE
PRETTY GOOD.
NO, YOU DID
THE RIGHT THING.

07:14.333 --> 07:16.300
PULLING IT OUT COULD
CAUSE MORE DAMAGE.

07:16.333 --> 07:18.167
I WANT TO DO AN X-RAY. I WANT
TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS

07:18.200 --> 07:20.733
NO NERVE OR MAJOR BLOOD VESSELS
BEING COMPROMISED.

07:20.767 --> 07:22.533
NOW, MR. BOOKER, DID YOU GET
YOUR INJURY, YOU KNOW, CHECKED?

07:22.567 --> 07:25.800
OH, THE DOCTOR SAID I'M FINE.
IT'S JUST SOME BRUISING.
GOOD, OKAY.

07:25.833 --> 07:27.733
I WANT TO FIND OUT
WHAT'S CAUSING THE CLENCHING.

07:27.767 --> 07:29.667
NOW DO YOU HAVE A HISTORY
OF SEIZURES?

07:29.700 --> 07:31.200
NO, NOTHING LIKE THAT.

07:31.233 --> 07:33.333
IT MAY... (clears throat)

07:33.367 --> 07:35.733
IT MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO
WITH HER BRAIN ANEURYSM.

07:35.767 --> 07:37.267
KYLE.
WHAT?

07:37.300 --> 07:39.100
I DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS NOW.

07:39.133 --> 07:41.533
CAN WE JUST TAKE
THIS FORK OUT AND GO?
NO.

07:41.567 --> 07:43.167
SHE WAS DIAGNOSED
ABOUT SIX WEEKS AGO.

07:43.200 --> 07:45.333
AND YOUR DOCTOR
DIDN'T RECOMMEND SURGERY?

07:45.367 --> 07:47.800
ALL THE SURGEONS HAVE SAID
IT'S INOPERABLE.

07:47.833 --> 07:49.767
THAT'S WHY KYLE AND I
ARE HERE IN SEATTLE.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.267
THE SPACE NEEDLE--

07:51.300 --> 07:53.633
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO SEE IT.

07:53.667 --> 07:56.567
WE WANTED
TO SEE IT TOGETHER.

07:58.500 --> 08:00.233
DO AN M.R.I.

08:00.267 --> 08:02.167
(whispers) IT WAS GOOD
TO SEE YOU TODAY.

08:02.200 --> 08:04.100
(siren wailing)
(Miranda) WHAT DO WE GOT?

08:04.133 --> 08:06.067
TACHYCARDIC IN THE 140s.
SYSTOLIC DIPPED TO THE 60s.

08:06.067 --> 08:07.400
LAST WAS 72 OVER 40.

08:07.433 --> 08:09.667
(Tuck crying)

08:09.700 --> 08:12.233
HEY, CAN YOU TURN THAT OFF?
TURN IT OFF.

08:12.267 --> 08:13.400
(siren wailing)

08:13.433 --> 08:16.100
DR. BAILEY?
(siren turns off)

08:16.133 --> 08:18.333
HERE... TAKE HIM.
UH, WHAT?

08:18.367 --> 08:20.500
YOU'RE GOING TO WATCH HIM.
OH, NO, NO, NO.
YOU DON'T WANT ME TO DO THAT.

08:20.533 --> 08:22.167
YANG, I HAVE A PATIENT.

08:22.200 --> 08:24.433
I NEED TO OPERATE
ON THAT PATIENT RIGHT NOW.

08:24.467 --> 08:26.067
TAKE HIM.
WHY DON'T WE
PAGE CHIEF--

08:26.100 --> 08:27.833
NO, I AM NOT PAGING ANYONE.
I'M A SURGEON.

08:27.867 --> 08:30.533
I'M GOING TO DO THE SURGERY.
CRIS--I...

08:30.567 --> 08:32.800
I NEED YOU TO HELP ME,
CRISTINA.

08:32.833 --> 08:34.067
I-I...

08:34.100 --> 08:35.533
(Tuck crying)

08:35.567 --> 08:37.733
YOU CAN WATCH FROM THE GALLERY.
YOU BOTH CAN.

08:37.767 --> 08:40.367
(crying continues)

08:42.300 --> 08:45.367
(crying continues)

08:58.067 --> 09:00.700
(clears throat)

09:00.733 --> 09:02.233
HEY.

09:02.267 --> 09:03.333
HEY.

09:03.367 --> 09:05.267
YOU DIDN'T CALL ME--
I DID. I DID.

09:05.300 --> 09:08.200
A FEW TIMES. I JUST
HUNG UP EVERY TIME.

09:09.433 --> 09:12.433
NICE. VERY STALKER-LIKE.

09:12.467 --> 09:14.633
GOES WITH THE HAIR.

09:14.667 --> 09:18.633
I JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD
LOOK GOOD A LITTLE SHORTER.

09:18.667 --> 09:20.700
IT IS SHORTER.

09:20.733 --> 09:22.633
I MAKE YOU NERVOUS,
DON'T I?

09:22.667 --> 09:24.300
YEAH, A LITTLE.

09:24.333 --> 09:26.733
THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S--WHAT?

09:26.767 --> 09:27.700
(laughs)

09:27.733 --> 09:29.400
HEY, ARE YOU BUSY?

09:29.433 --> 09:31.567
NO.

09:31.600 --> 09:35.633
WANT TO SEE SOMETHING
REALLY COOL?

09:35.667 --> 09:36.833
(George) WHOA.

09:36.867 --> 09:38.367
EXCELLENT, RIGHT?

09:38.400 --> 09:39.533
YEAH, IT IS.

09:39.567 --> 09:41.633
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?
AFTER HOCKEY PRACTICE
THIS MORNING,

09:41.667 --> 09:44.433
I DIDN'T HAVE MY GLOVE ON
'CAUSE I WAS GETTING A DRINK

09:44.467 --> 09:46.800
FROM THE GOALIE'S WATER BOTTLE,
NEXT THING I KNOW,

09:46.833 --> 09:48.733
THIS ASSHAT
CRASHES INTO THE NET,

09:48.767 --> 09:51.100
MY HAND GETS TANGLED IN THE MESH
AND I START HEARING POPS,

09:51.133 --> 09:53.633
BIG POPS.
DR. O'MALLEY,
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

09:53.667 --> 09:55.567
OH, DISLOCATION
OF THE P.I.P. JOINT,

09:55.600 --> 09:57.533
MULTIPLE FRACTURES.

09:57.567 --> 09:58.733
THAT MUST REALLY HURT.

09:58.767 --> 10:01.100
IT'S JUST A FINGER.

10:01.133 --> 10:03.767
LAST SEASON I TOOK A PUCK
TO THE FACE, BROKE TWO TEETH.

10:03.800 --> 10:05.467
OH, YEAH? OH.

10:05.500 --> 10:08.100
ORTHOS LOVE HOCKEY SEASON.
IT'S LIKE CHRISTMAS EVERY DAY.

10:08.133 --> 10:10.767
CAN WE JUST, LIKE, PUT IT
IN A SPLIT OR SOMETHING?

10:10.800 --> 10:13.767
I'VE GOT A REALLY BIG GAME
THIS AFTERNOON.

10:16.100 --> 10:17.833
UM, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

10:17.867 --> 10:20.367
I MEAN, HAVE YOU EVER
DONE THIS BEFORE?

10:20.400 --> 10:23.467
HAVE I EVER PULLED A FORK
OUT OF SOMEBODY'S NECK?

10:23.500 --> 10:25.567
MM, RIGHT.

10:25.600 --> 10:28.267
(chuckles)
OKAY.
LET'S JUST DO IT.

10:28.300 --> 10:29.633
HONEY.
HUH?

10:29.667 --> 10:31.133
TALK TO ME.
OKAY.

10:31.167 --> 10:33.067
DISTRACT ME.
OKAY.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.467
THINK ABOUT PARIS, HUH?
OKAY.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.600
AND ALL THE FOOD
AND THE WINE...
UH-HUH.

10:36.633 --> 10:40.100
THE LONG WALKS WE'LL TAKE
TOGETHER ON THE CHAMPS--WHAT?

10:40.133 --> 10:42.267
THE CHAMPS-éLYSéES.
CHAMPS-éLYSéES.

10:42.300 --> 10:43.800
YEAH.
MORE FOOD.

10:43.833 --> 10:45.033
YES.
MORE WINE.

10:45.067 --> 10:46.667
OKAY.
THAT'S IT?

10:46.700 --> 10:48.667
OH, MY GOD.
I DIDN'T EVEN FEEL ANYTHING.

10:48.700 --> 10:50.567
YOU'RE AMAZING.

10:50.600 --> 10:52.233
SHE'S AMAZING.

10:52.267 --> 10:56.067
SO... HOW MUCH DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT THIS DR. SHEPHERD?

10:56.100 --> 10:58.033
KYLE, NO.
WHAT?

10:58.067 --> 10:59.667
I DO NOT WANT
ANOTHER M.R.I.

10:59.700 --> 11:01.433
I WANT TO GO TO PARIS.

11:01.467 --> 11:04.333
I MADE A FEW CALLS. HE HAS
AN INCREDIBLE REPUTATION.

11:04.367 --> 11:08.500
PLEASE, KYLE...
LET'S JUST LIVE OUR LIVES.

11:08.533 --> 11:10.467
I WANT TO GO CRAZY.

11:10.500 --> 11:12.400
I WANT TO CRAWL
UNDERNEATH THE TABLE.

11:12.433 --> 11:15.133
I WANT TO GO TO PARIS
WHILE WE STILL CAN.

11:15.167 --> 11:18.167
DR. SHEPHERD IS
AN EXTRAORDINARY SURGEON.

11:18.200 --> 11:21.067
IF HE THINKS HE CAN HELP,
A SECOND OPINION COULDN'T HURT,

11:21.100 --> 11:23.067
COULD IT?
IT WON'T BE
A SECOND OPINION.

11:23.100 --> 11:24.800
IT'LL BE A FOURTH OPINION.

11:24.833 --> 11:28.200
AND WHEN DR. SHEPHERD SAYS
THERE'S NOTHING MORE HE CAN DO,

11:28.233 --> 11:31.133
WE'LL BE DEVASTATED
ALL OVER AGAIN.

11:31.167 --> 11:34.067
I JUST WANT TO SPEND
WHAT LITTLE TIME WE HAVE LEFT

11:34.067 --> 11:35.433
IN PARIS.

11:35.467 --> 11:36.700
SO DO I.

11:36.733 --> 11:39.600
BUT I DON'T WANT TO GO
TO PARIS AND WONDER

11:39.633 --> 11:41.533
IF WE SHOULD'VE LISTENED
TO THE AMAZING GIRL

11:41.567 --> 11:43.433
WHO TOOK THE FORK
OUTTA YOUR NECK.

11:43.467 --> 11:47.067
MM, MM, MM.

11:47.100 --> 11:48.500
(laughs)

11:48.533 --> 11:52.267
(both laughing)

11:53.700 --> 11:56.767
(Denny) YOU'RE NOT IZZIE.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.400
SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU.

11:58.433 --> 12:00.633
NOT DISAPPOINTED,
JUST SAYIN'...

12:00.667 --> 12:02.333
WHERE IS SHE?

12:02.367 --> 12:04.300
UH, SHE'S BUSY
WITH OTHER PATIENTS.

12:04.333 --> 12:07.067
I'M AFRAID YOU'LL HAVE TO
MAKE-DO WITH ME.

12:07.100 --> 12:09.400
LOOK, MAN,
I'M SURE YOU'RE--

12:09.433 --> 12:11.633
I'M SURE YOU'RE
A FINE DOCTOR,

12:11.667 --> 12:14.333
YOU'RE JUST--
JUST NOT AS MUCH MY TYPE.

12:14.367 --> 12:15.233
NO OFFENSE.

12:15.267 --> 12:17.333
WELL, THEN I GUESS
I'LL JUST HAVE TO SETTLE

12:17.367 --> 12:20.067
ON BEING IZZIE'S TYPE.

12:21.233 --> 12:22.533
SO Y--

12:24.333 --> 12:25.767
YOU TWO--
YEAH, YEAH.

12:25.800 --> 12:28.100
PRETTY MUCH, YOU KNOW?

12:30.867 --> 12:33.300
CONGRATULATIONS.

12:33.333 --> 12:35.500

12:35.533 --> 12:37.200
OH, GROSS.

12:37.233 --> 12:39.100

12:39.133 --> 12:43.067
* THIS REALLY COULDN'T
SUCK ANY WORSE *

12:43.100 --> 12:44.833
DR. YANG.

12:44.867 --> 12:47.100
OH, UH, DR. WEBBER.

12:47.133 --> 12:49.567
WHAT'S THAT SMELL?

12:49.600 --> 12:51.267
UH, IT'S FECES.

12:51.300 --> 12:53.833
IT'S BABY FECES.
WE'VE HAD AN INCIDENT, SIR.

12:53.867 --> 12:57.067
ARE YOU HAVING TROUBLE
WITH THE DIAPER, YANG?
SIR, NO, SIR.

12:57.067 --> 13:00.067
BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
HAVING TROUBLE WITH THE DIAPER.
NO, SIR, I'VE GOT, UH,

13:00.067 --> 13:01.800
I'VE GOT AN M.D.
FROM STANFORD

13:01.833 --> 13:03.367
AND A PhD FROM BERKELEY.

13:03.400 --> 13:05.667
I CAN HANDLE THIS DIAPER.
UNLESS YOU WANT TO.

13:05.700 --> 13:07.267
UH...

13:07.300 --> 13:08.500
N-N-NO.

13:08.533 --> 13:10.167
NO, IT--IT'S ALL RIGHT.

13:10.200 --> 13:11.133
YOU'RE--

13:11.167 --> 13:13.333
NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
YOU CARRY ON.

13:13.367 --> 13:16.333
CARRY ON. (clears throat)

13:19.833 --> 13:21.733
CAN WE STOP
FOR A MOMENT, PLEASE?

13:21.767 --> 13:22.700
SURE.

13:22.733 --> 13:24.433
I CAN WALK.

13:24.467 --> 13:27.100
OH, OKAY. THE WHEELCHAIR
IS JUST PROTOCOL.

13:27.133 --> 13:28.500
YEAH, WELL,

13:28.533 --> 13:30.433
I'M WAY PAST CARING
ABOUT PROTOCOL.

13:30.467 --> 13:33.333
I JUST WANNA FEEL MY BODY
MOVE WHILE I CAN.

13:33.367 --> 13:37.233
YOU SEEM... INCREDIBLY OKAY
WITH YOUR PROGNOSIS.

13:37.267 --> 13:39.533
I'M MORE THAN OKAY.

13:39.567 --> 13:41.567
I'M A LITTLE IN LOVE
WITH MY PROGNOSIS.

13:41.600 --> 13:43.133
IT WOKE ME UP,

13:43.167 --> 13:45.633
WOKE MY MARRIAGE UP.

13:45.667 --> 13:47.567
I BEEN SLEEPWALKING
ABOUT 15 YEARS,

13:47.600 --> 13:51.633
AND NOW I AM WIDE AWAKE.

13:51.667 --> 13:53.567
I'M HAVING THIS M.R.I.
FOR KYLE.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.500
HE'S NOT READY TO LET GO.

13:55.533 --> 13:58.500
BUT ME AND MY ANEURYSM...

13:58.533 --> 14:01.067
WE'RE GOOD FRIENDS.

14:01.067 --> 14:03.767
***

14:03.800 --> 14:05.700
HEY, I'VE BEEN LOOKING

14:07.433 --> 14:09.333

14:09.367 --> 14:10.833
OH, IT'S BIG.

14:10.867 --> 14:12.500
YOU GONNA TRY TO OPERATE?

14:12.533 --> 14:13.733
I'M DEFINITELY INTRIGUED.

14:13.767 --> 14:15.667
YOU KNOW WHO
CATHERINE DENEUVE IS?

14:15.700 --> 14:18.233
UM... YEAH, ACTRESS--

14:18.267 --> 14:19.800
FRENCH... HOT.

14:19.833 --> 14:21.733
ONE OF MY PATIENTS--
HER HUSBAND, ACTUALLY--

14:21.767 --> 14:23.433
UH, SAID I LOOK LIKE HER.

14:23.467 --> 14:25.067
(chuckles)

14:25.067 --> 14:26.633
ISN'T SHE BLONDE?

14:26.667 --> 14:29.700
YEAH... I GUESS.
I DON'T KNOW.

14:29.733 --> 14:31.400
I-I DON'T KNOW.

14:31.433 --> 14:33.733
ANYWAYS, UH...

14:33.767 --> 14:35.700
OKAY, YOU'RE BUSY.

14:35.733 --> 14:37.367
OKAY.

14:37.400 --> 14:39.333

14:39.367 --> 14:41.667
I'M NOT JUST ANOTHER
PRETTY FACE, YOU KNOW?

14:41.700 --> 14:44.333
I GOT IT GOIN' ON
UP HERE AS WELL.

14:44.367 --> 14:45.800
SO YOU KEEP TELLING ME.

14:45.833 --> 14:49.267
YEAH, I PROBABLY KNOW
HUNDREDS OF WORDS.

14:49.300 --> 14:50.633
REALLY, HUNDREDS?

14:50.667 --> 14:52.567
WOW, YOU'RE
A REAL BRAIN TRUST.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.100
OUCH.

14:54.133 --> 14:56.133
WELL,
I'M HIGHLY COMPETITIVE.

14:56.167 --> 14:57.833
(gasps) SCREW.

14:57.867 --> 15:00.633
S-C-R-E-W.

15:00.667 --> 15:04.100
THAT'S 25 POINTS,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

15:04.133 --> 15:05.367
WAIT A SECOND.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.767
NOW YOU DIDN'T TELL ME WE WERE
PLAYING NAUGHTY WORD SCRABBLE.

15:07.800 --> 15:10.067
(giggles) WE'RE NOT PLAYING
NAUGHTY WORD SCRABBLE.

15:10.100 --> 15:11.733
YOU JUST HAVE A DIRTY MIND.
OH, IT'S FILTHY.

15:11.767 --> 15:13.700
BUT YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT PUT DOWN "SCREW."

15:13.733 --> 15:15.833
I WAS REFERRING TO HARDWARE,
NOT SEX.

15:15.867 --> 15:18.133
OH.

15:18.167 --> 15:21.567
I GUESS MAYBE SOMETIMES,
IT'S, UH...

15:21.600 --> 15:24.833
IT'S HARD TO TELL WHERE--
WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM.

15:24.867 --> 15:26.767
***

15:26.800 --> 15:29.467
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
(sighs)

15:29.500 --> 15:33.733
ALEX, UH...

15:33.767 --> 15:37.600
HE MAY HAVE SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT YOU GUYS...

15:37.633 --> 15:39.767
UM, BEING TOGETHER.

15:39.800 --> 15:41.467
(scoffs)

15:41.500 --> 15:45.067
WELL... HE HAD NO BUSINESS
TELLING YOU THAT,

15:45.100 --> 15:48.200
AND BESIDES,
IT'S NOT EVEN TRUE, SO...

15:48.233 --> 15:50.200
SO YOU'RE NOT TOGETHER?

15:50.233 --> 15:53.133
NO. I MEAN...

15:53.167 --> 15:55.100
YEAH, A LITTLE, BUT...

15:55.133 --> 15:59.267
NOT REALLY, SO... NO.

16:00.433 --> 16:04.767
OKAY. WELL, SWEET.
THANKS, UH...

16:04.800 --> 16:07.700
THANKS FOR CLEARING THAT UP.

16:10.600 --> 16:12.500
(breathes raspily)

16:12.533 --> 16:14.400
(gasps)

16:14.433 --> 16:16.400
(gasps)

16:16.433 --> 16:18.133
DENNY, WHAT IS IT?

16:18.167 --> 16:20.400
(monitors beeping)
DON'T PANIC.
JUST TRY TO BREATHE.

16:20.433 --> 16:22.667
PAGE DR. BURKE!
(coughs)

16:22.700 --> 16:25.367
OKAY, JUST BREATHE.

16:25.400 --> 16:27.267
JUST BREATHE.
TAKE IT EASY.

16:27.300 --> 16:29.800
JUST TRY TO BREATHE.
(coughing)

16:29.833 --> 16:32.500
***

16:35.567 --> 16:36.600
HE HAD FLASH PULMONARY EDEMA.

16:36.633 --> 16:39.400
I SWITCHED HIM TO NESIRITIDE,
STARTED MILRINONE

16:39.433 --> 16:40.633
AND PUT HIM ON BiPAP.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.567
GOOD CALL, STEVENS.

16:42.600 --> 16:45.167
GOOD CALL.
BAD NEWS, RIGHT?

16:45.200 --> 16:46.700
IT'S NOT GOOD.

16:46.733 --> 16:48.333
THE FACT IS, DENNY,
YOU NEED A NEW HEART,

16:48.367 --> 16:51.200
AND YOU'RE RUNNING OUT
OF TIME.

16:51.233 --> 16:54.667
OKAY, SO... WHAT'S BEHIND
DOOR NUMBER TWO?

16:54.700 --> 16:56.067
I WOULD LIKE TO INSTALL

16:56.067 --> 16:57.533
A LEFT VENTRICULAR
ASSIST DEVICE.

16:57.567 --> 16:59.067
IT'S A BATTERY-OPERATED
MACHINE

16:59.100 --> 17:00.533
TO HELP YOUR HEART PUMP.

17:00.567 --> 17:02.533
BATTERY-OPERATED?

17:02.567 --> 17:04.333
I KNEW IT.

17:04.367 --> 17:07.233
YOU PEOPLE ARE TRYING
TO TURN ME INTO A ROBOT.

17:07.267 --> 17:09.300
(Izzie and Preston laugh)

17:09.333 --> 17:11.733
IT'S ALL PART OF YOUR EVIL PLAN
TO TAKE OVER THE HOSPITAL.

17:11.767 --> 17:14.067
IT'S A BRIDGE
TO TRANSPLANT, DENNY.

17:14.100 --> 17:17.067
IT'LL KEEP YOU ALIVE WHILE WE
WAIT FOR YOUR NEW HEART.

17:17.067 --> 17:18.400
YEAH...

17:18.433 --> 17:21.133
THAT EASY, HUH?

17:21.167 --> 17:22.500
NO CATCH?

17:22.533 --> 17:24.467
(Preston)
THERE ARE SOME RISKS--

17:24.500 --> 17:26.167
INCREASED DAMAGE
TO YOUR PLATELETS,

17:26.200 --> 17:27.433
INCREASED BLEEDING.

17:27.467 --> 17:29.367
AND IF YOU DO CHOOSE
THE ASSIST DEVICE,

17:29.400 --> 17:31.300
YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE
TO LEAVE THE HOSPITAL

17:31.333 --> 17:34.067
UNTIL YOU GET A DONOR HEART.

17:34.100 --> 17:35.433
(sighs)

17:37.667 --> 17:40.067
ANY OTHER OPTIONS?

17:45.833 --> 17:49.500
I'M GONNA NEED TIME
TO THINK.

17:50.667 --> 17:53.233
DON'T TAKE TOO LONG, DENNY.

17:57.200 --> 17:59.300
(whistles) ALWAYS HAPPY
TO GET THIS PAGE.

17:59.333 --> 18:01.233
STOP. THAT'S NOT WHY
I PAGED YOU.

18:01.267 --> 18:04.100
OH, WHAT, YOU PAGED ME
TO THE ON CALL ROOM TO TALK?

18:04.133 --> 18:06.067
NO, I PAGED YOU
TO THE ON CALL ROOM TO YELL.

18:06.067 --> 18:08.633
WHY THE HELL DID YOU TALK
TO DENNY ABOUT US?

18:08.667 --> 18:09.833
YOU HAD NO RIGHT.

18:09.867 --> 18:12.267
OH, BECAUSE YOU NEVER TALK
TO DENNY ABOUT PERSONAL STUFF.

18:12.300 --> 18:13.633
I DON'T TALK TO HIM
ABOUT OUR SEX LIFE, ALEX.

18:13.667 --> 18:15.700
THAT IS BETWEEN US.
OKAY, I GOT IT.

18:15.733 --> 18:18.267
SO NONE OF YOUR FRIENDS KNOW
THAT WE'RE SLEEPING TOGETHER?

18:18.300 --> 18:20.267
I'M SORRY, ARE YOU SAYING THAT
YOU AND DENNY ARE FRIENDS NOW?

18:20.300 --> 18:22.767
NO, I DON'T BECOME FRIENDS
WITH MY PATIENTS, IZZIE.
YOU'RE AN ASS.

18:22.800 --> 18:24.700
YOU FEEL THREATENED BY HIM,
THAT IS WHY YOU DID THAT.

18:24.733 --> 18:26.733
THERE IS NO OTHER REASON.
YOU'RE HIS DOCTOR, IZZIE.

18:26.767 --> 18:28.100
AND HE'S YOUR HALF-DEAD,

18:28.133 --> 18:30.833
POSSIBLY, SOON TO BE
ALL-DEAD PATIENT.

18:30.867 --> 18:33.567
HOW COULD I POSSIBLY BE
THREATENED BY THAT GUY?

18:33.600 --> 18:35.700
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU JUST SAID THAT.

18:35.733 --> 18:37.533
SOMEONE'S GOT TO.

18:45.200 --> 18:46.667
(Callie) I'LL SCHEDULE
THE SURGERY FOR YOUR SON.

18:46.700 --> 18:49.200
IN THE MEANTIME,
I'M SENDING HEATH HOME

18:49.233 --> 18:51.300
WITH A PRESCRIPTION
FOR HYDROCODONE

18:51.333 --> 18:52.767
TO CONTROL THE PAIN.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.633
LOOK, I-I GET THAT
THIS IS A BAD BREAK,

18:54.667 --> 18:56.167
BUT IT DOESN'T HURT
THAT MUCH.

18:56.200 --> 18:57.767
I'M TELLING YOU,
I CAN HANDLE THIS.

18:57.800 --> 18:59.667
SO HERE'S WHAT I'M THINKING--
WE TAKE THIS OFF,

18:59.700 --> 19:01.600
WE PUT A SMALL SPLINT
ON MY FINGER SO I CAN JAM IT

19:01.633 --> 19:03.600
INTO THE GLOVE, I PLAY TODAY,
AND THEN I'M ALL YOURS.

19:03.633 --> 19:07.467
YOU'RE NOT PLAYING TODAY.
THERE IS NO PLAYING TODAY.
HEATH, YOUR MOM IS RIGHT.

19:07.500 --> 19:10.667
THANK YOU.
DID YOU HEAR THAT? I'M RIGHT.

19:10.700 --> 19:12.400
YOUR MOTHER MUST BE
VERY PROUD.

19:12.433 --> 19:13.767
SCOUTS ARE COMING TODAY,
COLLEGE SCOUTS.

19:13.800 --> 19:16.067
I COULD GET A SCHOLARSHIP TODAY.
DON'T YOU GET THAT?

19:16.067 --> 19:17.833
HEATH, IF I CUT
THAT BANDAGE OFF,

19:17.867 --> 19:20.600
WE RISK DOING PERMANENT DAMAGE
TO YOUR FINGER.

19:21.800 --> 19:23.700
I'M WITH YOU, MAN,
BUT I'M SORRY,

19:23.733 --> 19:27.333
THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN PUT
YOUR FINGER INTO A GLOVE TODAY.

19:27.367 --> 19:29.267
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
YOU COULD DO.

19:29.300 --> 19:31.067
I NEED TO PLAY THIS AFTERNOON.

19:31.100 --> 19:33.767
THIS GAME IS WHAT I'VE BEEN
TRAINING FOR MY ENTIRE LIFE.

19:33.800 --> 19:35.233
THIS IS MY CHANCE
TO GO TO COLLEGE.

19:35.267 --> 19:36.733
THIS IS MY WHOLE FUTURE.

19:36.767 --> 19:38.600
OH, HONEY, YOU CAN GO
TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE

19:38.633 --> 19:40.733
AND GET YOUR GRADES UP
YOU CAN--

19:40.767 --> 19:42.667
I'M SORRY.

19:42.700 --> 19:44.567
I'M--I'M SORRY.

19:44.600 --> 19:47.467
OOH. SUCKS.

19:47.500 --> 19:49.367
YEAH.

19:50.400 --> 19:52.667
OH, DR. MONTGOMERY-SHEPHERD.

19:52.700 --> 19:55.067
ARE THOSE MY WIFE'S
TEST RESULTS THERE OR...

19:55.067 --> 19:56.400
YES, THEY ARE, ACTUALLY.

19:56.433 --> 19:58.133
THERE'S NO INFECTION.
EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD.

19:58.167 --> 20:00.400
I'M SCHEDULING A C-SECTION
THIS AFTERNOON.

20:00.433 --> 20:03.400
I WAS ACTUALLY GONNA GO UP
AFTER LUNCH AND TELL HER.

20:04.833 --> 20:07.367
MR. GIBSON...

20:07.400 --> 20:09.100
YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY DO LOOK
A LOT LIKE CATHERINE DENEUVE.

20:09.133 --> 20:11.300
I'M TALKING TO YOU
ABOUT YOUR WIFE...

20:11.333 --> 20:13.500
GIVING BIRTH TO YOUR BABY.

20:13.533 --> 20:15.300
I KNOW. I--I'M SORRY.
MAY I?

20:15.333 --> 20:19.267
LISTEN, I DON'T MEAN
TO FOCUS ON YOUR LOOKS.

20:19.300 --> 20:21.500
I MEAN, YOU SEEM VERY KIND
AND VERY INTELLIGENT--

20:21.533 --> 20:23.167
OBVIOUSLY, YOU'RE A DOCTOR.

20:23.200 --> 20:26.167
I DON'T MEAN TO OBJECTIFY
OR HARASS YOU IN ANY WAY.

20:26.200 --> 20:28.500
I JUST--I'M USUALLY
NOT THIS AWKWARD, BUT--

20:28.533 --> 20:30.667
BUT YOU'RE JUST SO
EXTRAORDINARILY BEAUTIFUL.

20:30.700 --> 20:33.567
I UNDERSTAND IF A BEAUTIFUL,
INTELLIGENT WOMAN LIKE YOU

20:33.600 --> 20:34.767
DOESN'T WANT TO EAT
WITH ME.

20:34.800 --> 20:37.200
SO, UH, ANYWAY...

20:37.233 --> 20:39.633
NO, NO.

20:39.667 --> 20:41.300
REALLY?

20:41.333 --> 20:43.100
YEAH, STAY. IT'S FINE.

20:43.133 --> 20:44.533
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

20:44.567 --> 20:47.333
YOU GONNA EAT THAT PUDDING?

20:47.367 --> 20:49.267
(Cristina) TAKE HIM.
(Izzie) NO,
BAILEY GAVE HIM TO YOU.

20:49.300 --> 20:52.167
SHE'S ONLY GONNA BE IN SURGERY
FOR ANOTHER HALF-HOUR.

20:52.200 --> 20:54.600
HOUR TOPS. TAKE HIM.
TAKE HIM.

20:54.633 --> 20:56.133
YOU'RE A LIAR, AND YOU
ALSO SMELL LIKE VOMIT.

20:56.167 --> 20:58.567
REALLY? 'CAUSE I THINK
SHE SMELLS LIKE POO.

20:58.600 --> 21:01.467
OKAY, THIS IS WHY SOME SPECIES
EAT THEIR YOUNG.

21:01.500 --> 21:02.733
HAVE YOU TALKED
TO MEREDITH YET?

21:02.767 --> 21:04.600
TOMORROW I AM, UH,
GONNA BUY A T-SHIRT

21:04.633 --> 21:06.533
THAT SAYS, "STOP ASKING ME
ABOUT MEREDITH,"

21:06.567 --> 21:09.200
AND I'M GONNA WEAR IT
EVERY DAY UNTIL PEOPLE

21:09.233 --> 21:11.133
STOP ASKING ME
ABOUT MEREDITH.
(Cristina) SHH.

21:11.167 --> 21:14.133
(whispers) AT LEAST THEY WON'T
BE ASKING YOU ABOUT YOUR HAIR.

21:15.800 --> 21:19.133
OH, COME ON.
MEREDITH, STOP HIM.

21:19.167 --> 21:21.567
DO YOU WANT TO SIT DOWN?
(Meredith) WHAT SHOULD I DO,
KNOCK HIM DOWN?

21:21.600 --> 21:22.767
DO YOU KNOW THAT
HE CUT HIS HAIR

21:22.800 --> 21:24.500
OVER MY BATHROOM SINK
THIS MORNING?

21:24.533 --> 21:25.600
GEORGE IS A GOOD ROOMMATE.

21:25.633 --> 21:28.167
IF YOU TELL HIM WHAT'S
ANNOYING YOU, HE WILL STOP.

21:28.200 --> 21:29.533
NO, HE'S NOT MY ROOM--
HE IS NOT MY--

21:29.567 --> 21:31.267
SEE, THIS IS WHY I SHOULDN'T
HAVE GIVEN UP MY PLACE.

21:31.300 --> 21:33.200
HE WOULD STILL BE
OUR ROOMMATE

21:33.233 --> 21:35.133
IF MEREDITH WOULD
JUST APOLOGIZE.

21:35.167 --> 21:37.667
I HAVE APOLOGIZED.
I HAVE APOLOGIZED SINCERELY.

21:37.700 --> 21:39.167
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:39.200 --> 21:41.467
IT TAKES TWO TO MAKE
A STUPID SEXUAL DECISION.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.067
SO WHATEVER.

21:43.100 --> 21:44.533
OH, UH...

21:44.567 --> 21:46.533
OH, YOU KNOW, I JUST MISS
WHEN WE ALL GOT ALONG.

21:46.567 --> 21:49.600
CAN'T WE JUST GO BACK TO THAT?

21:49.633 --> 21:51.200
***

21:51.233 --> 21:54.400
EXCUSE ME. I HAVE TO
CHECK ON A PATIENT.

21:55.833 --> 21:58.067
(Tuck crying)

21:58.100 --> 21:59.133
AWESOME.

21:59.167 --> 22:00.067
AWESOME.

22:00.100 --> 22:02.233
THANKS, ALEX. THANK YOU.

22:02.267 --> 22:03.767
OKAY. OKAY. SHH.

22:03.800 --> 22:06.700
(soothing voice)
SHUT IT, SHUT IT.

22:06.733 --> 22:08.633
THEY HAVE NO RIGHT
TO BE MAD AT ME.

22:08.667 --> 22:10.600
IT'S NONE OF THEIR BUSINESS.
I AGREE.

22:10.633 --> 22:13.333
YOU CAN'T AGREE. YOU DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

22:13.367 --> 22:15.633
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FACT
THAT YOU'RE MAD AT YOUR FRIENDS

22:15.667 --> 22:17.667
FOR BEING MAD AT YOU.
I HATE THEM. I DO.

22:17.700 --> 22:20.067
WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO?

22:20.100 --> 22:22.300
(chuckles)
I'M NOT TELLING YOU.

22:22.333 --> 22:25.200
OH.
YOU KNOW, AS A FRIEND...

22:25.233 --> 22:27.400
YOU SUCK.

22:31.133 --> 22:33.700
(laughing)

22:38.267 --> 22:41.300
DOES ADDISON KNOW
WE'RE FRIENDS?

22:43.167 --> 22:46.533
DID YOU GET SYLVIA BOOKER'S
BLOOD WORK BACK YET?

22:48.733 --> 22:51.100
I'M GOING RIGHT NOW.

22:56.700 --> 22:58.500
(Tuck crying)

22:58.533 --> 23:00.067
(intercom buzzes)

23:00.067 --> 23:02.400
Dr. Bailey.
WHAT IS IT, YANG?

23:02.433 --> 23:05.500
Uh, he's crying.

23:05.533 --> 23:08.133
LET ME HEAR HIM.

23:08.167 --> 23:09.100
What?

23:09.133 --> 23:11.667
LET ME HEAR THE BABY CRY.

23:11.700 --> 23:13.067
Uh...

23:13.067 --> 23:16.067
(crying)

23:18.067 --> 23:20.600
(crying continues)

23:20.633 --> 23:22.700
THAT'S CRY NUMBER FOUR.
YOU NEED TO FEED HIM.

23:22.733 --> 23:25.267
(crying continues)

23:25.300 --> 23:30.067
OH, GOD. OH...

23:30.067 --> 23:33.200
A DOUBLE-BARREL WHAT?
IT'S A DOUBLE-BARREL
BRAIN BYPASS.

23:33.233 --> 23:35.133
I'M GONNA USE
TWO SCALP ARTERIES

23:35.167 --> 23:37.067
TO REDIRECT THE BLOOD FLOW
IN YOUR BRAIN

23:37.100 --> 23:39.267
AROUND THE ANEURYSM.
HOW COME NO ONE ELSE
HAS MENTIONED THIS?

23:39.300 --> 23:41.200
WELL, IT'S A SURGERY
THAT'S BEEN PERFORMED

23:41.233 --> 23:42.600
LESS THAN A DOZEN TIMES.

23:42.633 --> 23:43.833
I HAVE PERFORMED ONE
SUCCESSFULLY,

23:43.867 --> 23:45.767
AND I'VE WATCHED ONE,

23:45.800 --> 23:47.700
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO UNDERSTATE THE RISKS.
(Kyle) RISKS?

23:47.733 --> 23:49.367
MM-HMM. THE RISKS ARE
THAT THE ANEURYSM

23:49.400 --> 23:51.433
COULD RUPTURE ON THE TABLE.

23:51.467 --> 23:54.267
BUT YOU THINK THERE'S A CHANCE,
A CHANCE IT COULD WORK?
NO.

23:54.300 --> 23:56.500
HELL NO.

23:56.533 --> 23:59.267
I'M LEAVING,
AND WE'RE GOING TO EUROPE.

23:59.300 --> 24:02.200
WE'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO SEE IT,
BUT WE NEVER HAD THE TIME.

24:02.233 --> 24:03.767
THIS IS THE TIME.

24:03.800 --> 24:05.167
WE'RE GOING.

24:05.200 --> 24:07.667
THAT'S IT.

24:14.233 --> 24:15.400
DR. SHEPHERD,

24:15.433 --> 24:17.400
CAN I GET A WORD?

24:17.433 --> 24:19.167
YES.

24:19.200 --> 24:20.300
UM, I'M SORRY IF MY WIFE
OFFENDED YOU.

24:20.333 --> 24:21.600
OH, NO.
NO OFFENSE AT ALL.

24:21.633 --> 24:25.467
UM, I DIDN'T NOTICE HER.

24:25.500 --> 24:27.500
I'M SORRY?

24:27.533 --> 24:29.700
FOR 15 YEARS,
I DIDN'T NOTICE HER.

24:29.733 --> 24:31.633
WHEN WE GOT MARRIED,
SHE WAS EVERYTHING.

24:31.667 --> 24:34.233
SOMETIME,
SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY,

24:34.267 --> 24:36.433
I STOPPED NOTICING HER.
I STOPPED SEEING HER.

24:36.467 --> 24:39.067
SINCE SHE'S BEEN SICK,
SHE'S ALL I SEE.

24:39.100 --> 24:40.833
AND I HATE THAT
THAT'S WHAT IT TOOK.

24:40.867 --> 24:42.767
I-I HATE IT AND I'M SORRY.

24:42.800 --> 24:44.167
BUT I LOVE HER.

24:44.200 --> 24:47.200
AND I DON'T WANT HER TO...

24:47.233 --> 24:50.500
I DON'T WANT MY WIFE TO DIE.

24:50.533 --> 24:52.400
PLEASE TALK TO HER.

24:52.433 --> 24:54.667
DR. SHEPHERD, PLEASE.

24:54.700 --> 24:56.567
OKAY.

25:03.067 --> 25:06.833
I HAD A LUNCH DATE WITH
MY PATIENT'S HUSBAND TODAY.

25:06.867 --> 25:09.100
HE PAID ATTENTION TO ME,
MIRANDA...

25:09.133 --> 25:11.533
FOR A WHOLE HALF-HOUR.

25:11.567 --> 25:14.533
ADDISON... YOU'RE NOT
GONNA FIX THE PROBLEMS

25:14.567 --> 25:16.333
WITH YOUR HUSBAND

25:16.367 --> 25:18.800
BY HAVING MEALS
WITH SOMEONE ELSE'S.

25:20.533 --> 25:23.300
I MEAN IT.

25:23.333 --> 25:25.233
OH, PLEASE EAT. EAT.
(Tuck crying)

25:25.267 --> 25:27.567
I'M BEGGING YOU TO EAT.

25:27.600 --> 25:29.367
IT'S YUMMY FOOD.
YUMMY...

25:29.400 --> 25:32.633
BAILEY...
BREAST MILK... FOOD.

25:32.667 --> 25:34.067
COME ON.

25:34.067 --> 25:36.600
WELL, LOOK AT YOU.

25:36.633 --> 25:39.500
YOU FIND THIS AMUSING?
AND YOU DON'T?

25:39.533 --> 25:41.067
COME ON. YOU KNOW WHAT?

25:41.100 --> 25:42.600
I CAN'T HELP YOU.
I CAN'T HELP YOU.

25:42.633 --> 25:45.200
I CANNOT HELP YOU
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO EAT.

25:45.233 --> 25:47.533
IF YOU'RE GONNA
KEEP ON CRYING...

25:47.567 --> 25:49.167
THEN EAT.

25:53.833 --> 25:56.700
O'MALLEY, YOU'RE A NATURAL.
YOU HAVE NIECES AND NEPHEWS?
NO, SIR.

25:56.733 --> 25:58.133
BABIES JUST LIKE ME.

25:58.167 --> 26:01.433
WELL, THAT SPEAKS
TO A GOOD BEDSIDE MANNER.

26:01.467 --> 26:03.367
KEEP IT UP.
THANKS, SIR.

26:03.400 --> 26:04.600
(pager beeps)

26:04.633 --> 26:06.267
HEY, IS THAT BAILEY'S BABY?

26:06.300 --> 26:07.233
YEAH.

26:07.267 --> 26:08.633
OH, HE IS SO CUTE.

26:08.667 --> 26:11.233
HI THERE, LITTLE MAN.

26:11.267 --> 26:13.667
SO I SCHEDULED
THE MERCER KID'S SURGERY

26:13.700 --> 26:15.200
FOR TOMORROW AFTERNOON.

26:15.233 --> 26:16.567
I ASSUME YOU WANT IN?

26:16.600 --> 26:19.267
OH, NO, I WANT IN. ON A SURGERY,
ANY SURGERY. I'LL DO IT.

26:19.300 --> 26:21.800
WHO ARE YOU?

26:21.833 --> 26:24.267
I'M CRISTINA.

26:24.300 --> 26:26.733
SORRY, I ONLY NEED ONE.

26:26.767 --> 26:29.700
OH, WELL, ABSOLUTELY,
I'M IN.

26:29.733 --> 26:30.833
OH, AND, GEORGE.
HMM?

26:30.867 --> 26:33.200
THIS IS THE LAST INVITATION
I'M EXTENDING,

26:33.233 --> 26:36.567
SO... THE BALL'S
IN YOUR COURT.

26:36.600 --> 26:38.333
OKAY.
OKAY.

26:40.867 --> 26:42.767
SERIOUSLY?

26:42.800 --> 26:43.733
SERIOUSLY.

26:43.767 --> 26:45.667
NICE.

26:45.700 --> 26:47.700
THINK SHE HAS A COUCH
YOU CAN SLEEP ON?

26:49.567 --> 26:51.467
MRS. BOOKER.

26:51.500 --> 26:55.300
I'M WAITING FOR MY HUSBAND.
HE'S BRINGING THE CAR.

26:55.333 --> 26:57.733
MRS. BOOKER...

26:57.767 --> 27:00.067
I KNOW YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT THE SURGERY.

27:00.100 --> 27:01.467
NO, I'M NOT.

27:01.500 --> 27:04.367
I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT IT
BECAUSE I'M NOT HAVING IT.

27:04.400 --> 27:07.767
YOU'RE NOT HAVING THE SURGERY
BECAUSE OF THE MEDICAL RISKS.

27:07.800 --> 27:10.333
NO, I'M NOT HAVING IT
BECAUSE--

27:10.367 --> 27:12.267
BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN 12 YEARS,

27:12.300 --> 27:15.167
I HAVE A GREAT MARRIAGE
AND I HAVE A LIFE,

27:15.200 --> 27:17.100
AND I WANT TO LIVE IT.

27:17.133 --> 27:19.333
YOU--YOU HAVE WEEKS.

27:19.367 --> 27:21.533
IF THIS SURGERY
IS SUCCESSFUL,

27:21.567 --> 27:24.467
YOU'RE LOOKING AT DECADES.

27:26.067 --> 27:27.800
I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND.

27:27.833 --> 27:30.133
I'M NOT CRAZY,
AND I DON'T WANT TO DIE.

27:30.167 --> 27:33.067
BUT I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK
TO BEING KYLE'S BED WARMER

27:33.067 --> 27:35.200
IN A FULL-LENGTH
FLANNEL NIGHTGOWN.

27:35.233 --> 27:36.767
CAN YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

27:36.800 --> 27:38.833
YEAH, I UNDERSTAND
YOU'RE TIRED OF SETTLING.

27:38.867 --> 27:42.300
SO DON'T. FIGHT.

27:42.333 --> 27:44.067
FIGHT FOR YOUR LIFE.

27:44.067 --> 27:45.533
FIGHT FOR YOUR MARRIAGE.

27:45.567 --> 27:48.167
LET ME OPERATE,

27:48.200 --> 27:50.100
AND MAKE A DECISION
RIGHT NOW

27:50.133 --> 27:52.633
THAT YOU'LL
NEVER SETTLE AGAIN.

28:05.433 --> 28:08.067
THE LVAD WILL INHIBIT
ORGAN DETERIORATION.

28:08.067 --> 28:11.133
IT'LL ALLOW YOU TO GET OFF
MOST OF THE MEDS THAT YOU'RE ON,

28:11.167 --> 28:14.233
AND IT'LL GIVE YOUR HEART
A MUCH NEEDED REST.

28:16.067 --> 28:18.467
IZZIE...

28:18.500 --> 28:21.100
I'M JUST...

28:21.133 --> 28:24.667
I'M JUST SO TIRED.

28:27.500 --> 28:29.400
I APPRECIATE THAT.

28:29.433 --> 28:32.467
BUT THE LVAD ALSO HAS
INCREASED SURVIVAL RATES

28:32.500 --> 28:34.133
OVER CONVENTIONAL THERAPIES.

28:34.167 --> 28:36.300
AND I THINK THAT YOU NEED TO--
HEY.

28:36.333 --> 28:37.667
HEY.

28:37.700 --> 28:42.700
HAVING THIS SURGERY...

28:42.733 --> 28:44.800
IT MEANS
I DON'T GET TO LEAVE HERE.

28:48.100 --> 28:51.533
AND YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
I HATE HOSPITALS.

28:55.067 --> 28:57.167
I DO KNOW.

28:57.200 --> 29:00.100
BUT AS YOUR DOCTOR,
I CAN'T SUPPORT YOU MAKING

29:00.133 --> 29:01.833
ANY OTHER DECISION.

29:01.867 --> 29:04.100
THE SURGERY WILL ALLOW YOU
MORE TIME,

29:04.133 --> 29:06.300
AND WE NEED MORE TIME.

29:06.333 --> 29:09.200
WE?

29:09.233 --> 29:12.533
WE--YOUR DOCTORS...

29:12.567 --> 29:14.567
NEED MORE TIME.

29:18.133 --> 29:21.400
AND WE NEED MORE TIME.

29:24.300 --> 29:27.067
SO...

29:27.100 --> 29:28.433
YOU'LL BE HERE?

29:28.467 --> 29:30.367
EVERY DAY.

29:32.833 --> 29:35.533
AND AS AN ADDED BONUS...

29:35.567 --> 29:37.533
IT'LL REALLY PISS OFF ALEX.

29:37.567 --> 29:41.567
(laughs) YES, THAT IT WILL.

29:43.667 --> 29:46.233
OKAY.

29:46.267 --> 29:48.600
OKAY?

29:48.633 --> 29:53.167
(sighs) OKAY.

29:53.200 --> 29:58.067
(sighs) OKAY. OKAY.

30:09.233 --> 30:11.533
HEATH.
HEY, I TOLD YOU
I COULDN'T MISS MY GAME,

30:11.567 --> 30:13.567
AND I DIDN'T. I MADE
TWO GOALS AND ONE ASSIST,

30:13.600 --> 30:14.833
AND THERE WERE SCOUTS THERE.

30:14.867 --> 30:18.133
WHAT DID YOU DO?
I CUT OFF MY FINGER.

30:18.167 --> 30:19.667
IT'S OKAY.

30:19.700 --> 30:22.700
I SAVED IT SO YOU GUYS
COULD SEW IT BACK ON.

30:30.467 --> 30:32.367
(Callie) THERE'S
DEEP TISSUE INFECTION HERE.

30:32.400 --> 30:34.033
NOT GOOD.

30:34.067 --> 30:35.800
HE SAID HE FOUND OUT HOW TO
DO IT ON THE INTERNET.

30:35.833 --> 30:38.800
WHO PUTS UP WEB PAGES ON HOW
TO CUT OFF YOUR OWN FINGER?

30:38.833 --> 30:40.733
WELL, HE'S GOT A PASSION
AND HE SACRIFICED FOR IT.

30:40.767 --> 30:43.033
YOU GOTTA RESPECT THAT.

30:43.067 --> 30:45.500
NO... YOU DON'T.

30:45.533 --> 30:47.400
HE--HE CUT OFF HIS OWN FINGER,

30:47.433 --> 30:50.067
A FINGER THAT--SORRY--
THAT WOULD'VE HEALED PERFECTLY

30:50.100 --> 30:51.267
IN A FEW MONTHS.

30:51.300 --> 30:53.167
SOMETIMES YOU CAN'T WAIT.

30:53.200 --> 30:55.267
YOU JUST WANT THE PAIN
TO STOP.

30:55.300 --> 30:59.600
SO YOU CUT IT OFF.
END THE PROBLEM, END THE PAIN.

30:59.633 --> 31:02.200
THAT DOESN'T END THE PAIN.

31:02.233 --> 31:04.600
NO. NO, I MEAN,
IF IT'S THAT PAINFUL,

31:04.633 --> 31:06.800
TO START WITH,
THEN EVEN IF YOU CUT IT OFF,

31:06.833 --> 31:10.733
THERE'S ALWAYS GONNA BE
THAT PHANTOM PAIN.

31:12.667 --> 31:16.067
YOUR EX DID A REAL NUMBER
ON YOU, HUH?

31:18.367 --> 31:20.067
AND YOU'RE QUITTING
YOUR JOB.

31:20.067 --> 31:21.233
OH, ABSOLUTELY.

31:21.267 --> 31:23.600
AND WE'RE SELLING
THE HOUSE.
MM-HMM.

31:23.633 --> 31:24.833
AND WE'RE MOVING TO PARIS,

31:24.867 --> 31:26.767
AND WE'RE SPENDING
THAT NEST EGG NOW.
YEAH.

31:26.800 --> 31:29.267
PROMISE?
I PROMISE.

31:29.300 --> 31:31.067
AND, BABY.
YEAH?

31:31.067 --> 31:34.467
IF I DIE...

31:34.500 --> 31:37.167
PROMISE ME
YOU'LL DO IT ANYWAY.

31:39.100 --> 31:40.367
I PROMISE.

31:46.233 --> 31:47.733
I'M SORRY.

31:47.767 --> 31:49.833
THIS IS AS FAR
AS YOU CAN GO.

31:49.867 --> 31:51.800
SYLVIA...

31:51.833 --> 31:54.267
PLEASE DON'T DIE.

31:54.300 --> 31:56.667
I'LL DO MY BEST.

32:03.567 --> 32:08.267
***

32:08.300 --> 32:12.767
I FED HIM. OH, GOD,
THERE'S POOP EVERYWHERE.

32:12.800 --> 32:14.167
ALL RIGHT.

32:14.200 --> 32:16.533
GO BACK TO SLEEP,
CRISTINA.

32:16.567 --> 32:18.467
I KNOW YOU'RE THE BOSS OF ME,

32:18.500 --> 32:20.733
AND YOU COULD DESTROY
MY CAREER

32:20.767 --> 32:22.667
AND MAKE MY LIFE
A LIVING HELL

32:22.700 --> 32:25.367
AND TORTURE AND PAIN
AND ALL THAT,

32:25.400 --> 32:27.267
BUT JUST, IN THE FUTURE,

32:27.300 --> 32:29.333
I DON'T BABY-SIT.

32:29.367 --> 32:32.100
FINE.

32:32.133 --> 32:35.067
***

32:35.100 --> 32:38.467
(baby cries)

32:38.500 --> 32:41.100
I READ THAT A PATIENT'S HEART
CAN SOMETIMES REMODEL ITSELF

32:41.133 --> 32:43.600
AND THEY CAN BE WEANED OFF
THE LVAD.

32:43.633 --> 32:46.567
(Preston)
HIS HEART IS TOO WEAK.

32:46.600 --> 32:50.500
***

32:54.467 --> 32:57.800
***

33:03.200 --> 33:05.733
***

33:07.333 --> 33:10.100
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
EVERYBODY WAS DOING OKAY.

33:10.133 --> 33:14.400
EVERYTHING'S FINE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

33:14.433 --> 33:16.333
***

33:16.367 --> 33:18.200
OH, YEAH, RIGHT.
THANK--THANKS.

33:18.233 --> 33:20.067
YEAH. YEAH.

33:20.067 --> 33:23.067
***

33:24.667 --> 33:27.100
WHEN YOU PUT
YOUR FRESHLY SEVERED FINGER

33:27.133 --> 33:29.433
INTO A GRUNGY,
BACTERIA-FILLED GLOVE,

33:29.467 --> 33:32.467
YOU GOT A SEVERE INFECTION.
(Heath) WHAT?

33:32.500 --> 33:34.700
NO. THE INTERNET DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT INFECTION.

33:34.733 --> 33:36.400
(George) MRS. MERCER,

33:36.433 --> 33:39.067
WE DIDN'T REALIZE HOW DEEP
THE INFECTION HAD GONE

33:39.067 --> 33:41.133
UNTIL WE WERE IN THERE. THERE
WAS TOO MUCH TISSUE DAMAGE.

33:41.167 --> 33:43.700
HEATH, THE INFECTION
WAS CAUSED BY

33:43.733 --> 33:45.200
A METHICILLIN-RESISTANT
STAPH BACTERIA,

33:45.233 --> 33:46.767
AND IT'S CONTINUING
TO SPREAD.

33:46.800 --> 33:48.233
WE'LL BE LUCKY IF WE CAN
PRESERVE ENOUGH MUSCLE

33:48.267 --> 33:50.133
FOR YOU TO HAVE
ANY HAND FUNCTION AT ALL.

33:50.167 --> 33:53.067
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WH--WHAT DOES SHE MEAN?

33:53.067 --> 33:56.400
YOU MAY NEVER REGAIN
COMPLETE CONTROL OF YOUR HAND.

33:56.433 --> 33:59.500
NO. THAT'S WRONG.

33:59.533 --> 34:01.200
YOU'RE WRONG.

34:01.233 --> 34:03.233
RONNIE LOTT PLAYED
FOR THE 49ers

34:03.267 --> 34:05.300
WHEN HE CUT OFF HIS FINGER.
HE COULD STILL PLAY.

34:05.333 --> 34:07.733
I GOT THE DIRECTIONS
OFF THE INTERNET. I--

34:07.767 --> 34:10.067
OH, GOD, MY POOR BABY.
MOM, STOP, THEY'RE LYING.

34:10.100 --> 34:11.533
THEY'RE JUST TRYING
TO SCARE ME.

34:11.567 --> 34:14.800
HEATH, I'M SORRY.
I REALLY AM, BUT...

34:14.833 --> 34:17.667
YOUR HOCKEY CAREER
IS OVER.

34:17.700 --> 34:20.400
MOM?

34:20.433 --> 34:21.600
MOM, THEY'RE WRONG, RIGHT?

34:21.633 --> 34:23.167
MM-HMM.

34:23.200 --> 34:25.200
THEY HAVE TO BE WRONG.
OH, SWEETHEART.

34:25.233 --> 34:27.833
I GOT THE DIRECTIONS
OFF THE INTERNET.

34:27.867 --> 34:29.433
(Meredith)
IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE

34:29.467 --> 34:32.133
OF VASOSPASM OR BLEEDING?

34:32.167 --> 34:34.200
NO, LOOKS GOOD.

34:34.233 --> 34:36.200
SO YOU THINK
THEY'LL MOVE TO PARIS?

34:36.233 --> 34:38.800
I HOPE SO.

34:51.133 --> 34:52.300
THAT WAS AMAZING.

34:52.333 --> 34:54.067
YEAH, IT WAS, WASN'T IT?

34:54.100 --> 34:56.167
YEAH.

34:56.200 --> 34:59.233
YEAH.

34:59.267 --> 35:01.133
MEREDITH...

35:02.500 --> 35:04.700
YOU KNOW I WAS KIDDING
THIS MORNING?

35:04.733 --> 35:07.800
I MEAN, YOU CAN TELL ME
ABOUT THIS HORRIBLE THING.

35:07.833 --> 35:10.433
COME ON.
YOU CAN TALK TO ME.

35:12.533 --> 35:14.433
AS A FRIEND.

35:14.467 --> 35:16.633
AS A FRIEND.

35:21.400 --> 35:24.433
THERE'S A LINE BETWEEN
FRIENDS AND NOT FRIENDS,

35:24.467 --> 35:27.567
AND IF I TELL YOU THIS...

35:27.600 --> 35:29.500
IF I TELL YOU
THIS HORRIBLE THING,

35:29.533 --> 35:31.433
THEN YOU HAVE TO REACT
AS MY FRIEND,

35:31.467 --> 35:32.600
NOT MY NOT FRIEND.

35:32.633 --> 35:35.433
I CAN DO THAT.

35:35.467 --> 35:37.100
ALL RIGHT.

35:37.133 --> 35:40.467
YOU TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG,
I'LL TELL YOU HOW TO FIX IT.

35:42.433 --> 35:44.733
OKAY. YOU READY?

35:44.767 --> 35:46.400
I'M READY.

35:49.133 --> 35:51.500
(sighs)

35:52.800 --> 35:55.500
I SLEPT WITH GEORGE.

35:59.667 --> 36:02.433
AND... IT WAS
A HORRIBLE MISTAKE,

36:02.467 --> 36:04.733
AND NOW EVERYTHING
HAS CHANGED,

36:04.767 --> 36:07.600
AND I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO REPAIR IT.

36:07.633 --> 36:09.533
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHERE TO START,

36:09.567 --> 36:11.467
BUT I JUST KNOW
THAT I HAVE TO,

36:11.500 --> 36:13.533
AND... (sighs)

36:17.667 --> 36:20.733
SAY SOMETHING FRIENDLY.

36:23.500 --> 36:25.400
YOU TELL HIM THAT.

36:25.433 --> 36:28.267
YOU FIND GEORGE,
AND YOU APOLOGIZE.

36:28.300 --> 36:30.633
THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE'S SAYING,
BUT HE WON'T LISTEN.

36:30.667 --> 36:32.800
MAKE HIM LISTEN.
YOU TELL HIM YOU'RE SORRY.

36:32.833 --> 36:34.300
JUST TELL HIM AGAIN

36:34.333 --> 36:36.200
AND AGAIN AND AGAIN
UNTIL HE LISTENS.

36:36.233 --> 36:38.067
HOW DO I DO THAT?

36:39.567 --> 36:42.433
YOU DO WHAT I DO.

36:42.467 --> 36:44.733
USE THE ELEVATOR.

37:02.533 --> 37:03.767
YOU'RE TRAPPED.

37:03.800 --> 37:05.833
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO TALK.

37:05.867 --> 37:08.533
I'LL DO THE TALKING.

37:08.567 --> 37:10.667
GEORGE...

37:10.700 --> 37:13.100
I AM TRULY...

37:13.133 --> 37:15.833
VERY DEEPLY SORRY.

37:15.867 --> 37:18.233
AND I'M NOT GOING
TO MAKE EXCUSES.

37:18.267 --> 37:19.433
I'M JUST SORRY.

37:19.467 --> 37:21.367
***

37:21.400 --> 37:24.067
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA
GET OFF THIS ELEVATOR

37:24.067 --> 37:25.800
AND WALK AWAY
AND NOT LOOK BACK.

37:25.833 --> 37:27.767
I KNOW THAT.

37:27.800 --> 37:30.567
BUT, GEORGE, WE'RE FRIENDS.
REAL FRIENDS.

37:30.600 --> 37:32.500
AND THAT MEANS, NO MATTER
HOW LONG IT TAKES,

37:32.533 --> 37:35.333
WHEN YOU FINALLY DO DECIDE
TO LOOK BACK,

37:35.367 --> 37:37.533
I'LL STILL BE HERE.

37:37.567 --> 37:41.067
***

37:41.067 --> 37:43.100
(bell dings)

37:43.133 --> 37:46.733
AS DOCTORS, AS FRIENDS,
AS HUMAN BEINGS,

37:46.767 --> 37:49.067
WE ALL TRY TO DO
THE BEST WE CAN.

37:49.067 --> 37:52.600
***

38:04.500 --> 38:06.633
HEY.

38:06.667 --> 38:09.300
(sighs)

38:09.333 --> 38:12.067
DON'T YOU HAVE
SOMEWHERE TO BE?

38:12.067 --> 38:13.433
YEAH.

38:13.467 --> 38:16.733
YEAH, I'M THERE.

38:16.767 --> 38:18.633
***

38:18.667 --> 38:22.733
BUT THE WORLD IS FULL
OF UNEXPECTED TWISTS AND TURNS.

38:27.333 --> 38:28.467
AND JUST WHEN YOU THINK

38:28.500 --> 38:30.833
YOU'VE GOT THE LAY
OF THE LAND,

38:30.867 --> 38:32.333
THE GROUND
UNDERNEATH YOU SHIFTS

38:32.367 --> 38:35.067
AND KNOCKS YOU OFF YOUR FEET.

38:35.100 --> 38:38.667
***

38:48.333 --> 38:50.533
IF YOU'RE LUCKY,

38:50.567 --> 38:54.233
YOU END UP WITH NOTHING MORE
THAN A FLESH WOUND.

38:54.267 --> 38:56.767
SOMETHING A BAND-AID
WILL COVER.

38:56.800 --> 38:59.800
***

39:07.333 --> 39:08.267
HI.

39:08.300 --> 39:11.533
HEY.

39:11.567 --> 39:14.333
BUT SOME WOUNDS ARE DEEPER
THAN THEY FIRST APPEAR

39:14.367 --> 39:17.367
AND REQUIRE MORE
THAN JUST A QUICK FIX.

39:26.167 --> 39:28.133
WHAT?

39:30.367 --> 39:32.633
I WAS INDIFFERENT...

39:32.667 --> 39:35.733
YOU KNOW, IN NEW YORK,
BEFORE MARK.

39:37.600 --> 39:40.567
I WAS JUST INDIFFERENT
TOWARDS YOU.

39:42.200 --> 39:44.067
YES.

39:46.067 --> 39:48.633
AND I WAS ABSENT.

39:49.800 --> 39:51.700
YES.

39:51.733 --> 39:54.733
***

39:56.567 --> 39:57.733
I'M PARTLY TO BLAME

39:57.767 --> 40:01.300
FOR WHAT'S HAPPENED
TO OUR MARRIAGE.

40:01.333 --> 40:04.400
YEAH.

40:05.700 --> 40:08.333
I'M SORRY.

40:12.167 --> 40:15.133
I'M WORKING ON IT.

40:18.400 --> 40:19.733
OKAY.

40:23.667 --> 40:29.067
WITH SOME WOUNDS, YOU'VE GOT
TO RIP OFF THE BAND-AID,

40:29.100 --> 40:33.567
