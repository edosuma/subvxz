By the time we turned it over

You'll forgive me if I don't
take you at your word.

26:43.908 --> 26:46.275

is a number.

No, not my intention.

26:58.589 --> 26:59.921
That's what happened.

26:59.923 --> 27:01.590
It had to be a closed system.

27:01.592 --> 27:03.024
It was the only way
to protect people's rights.
