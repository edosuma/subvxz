WEBVTT

00:13.440 --> 00:15.044
MAN:
SEARCH IS CLEAR.

00:16.270 --> 00:18.056
MAN: GOOD.

00:18.100 --> 00:19.579
GO.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.053
MAN: HOLD.

00:32.110 --> 00:34.112
ALL RIGHT,
HOLD IT. BACK UP.

00:36.160 --> 00:37.673
MAN: WE GOT A BODY.

00:37.730 --> 00:39.118
OPEN IT.

00:39.160 --> 00:41.071
RIGHT.

00:41.120 --> 00:42.815
MAN: IT'S CUT.

00:48.170 --> 00:50.172
MAN, ON RADIO:
ALPHA'S MADE ENTRY.

01:04.020 --> 01:08.104
MAN: STILL WARM.
THIS KILL IS FRESH.

01:08.150 --> 01:09.970
OWEN.

01:10.020 --> 01:11.840
YOU KNOW THIS GUY?

01:22.250 --> 01:24.377
PRENTISS: HEY.

01:24.430 --> 01:25.818
WE WERE TOO LATE.

01:25.860 --> 01:27.646
WE TRIED.

01:27.690 --> 01:29.203
NOW WE NEED TO
TELL THE TEAM.

01:29.260 --> 01:32.127
MAN: GET OFF ME!

01:32.170 --> 01:33.694
MAN: RIGHT THERE!
DROP THE WEAPON!

01:33.740 --> 01:36.265
REID: OWEN!

01:36.310 --> 01:37.732
HOLD IT. HOLD IT.

01:37.790 --> 01:39.269
OWEN, WAIT.
DROP YOUR
WEAPON!

01:39.310 --> 01:41.392
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
THIS MAN IS ON THE JOB.

01:41.440 --> 01:43.226
FBI SPECIAL AGENT
OWEN QUINN,

01:43.270 --> 01:46.831
BADGE NUMBER
2310-NINER-5.

01:46.880 --> 01:48.438
OWEN, LOOK AT ME.

01:52.370 --> 01:53.883
REID?

01:56.240 --> 01:58.458
PRENTISS.
YES.

01:58.500 --> 01:59.842
YOU'RE SAFE
NOW, OWEN.

01:59.900 --> 02:00.935
YOU'RE HOME.

02:05.380 --> 02:06.631
HOW LONG?

02:06.690 --> 02:07.850
DON'T WORRY ABOUT
THAT RIGHT NOW.

02:07.910 --> 02:09.639
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU'RE OK.

02:09.690 --> 02:10.907
WHAT YEAR IS IT?

02:10.950 --> 02:12.167
IT'S 2018.

02:13.950 --> 02:15.258
NO!

02:16.740 --> 02:19.300
YOU'RE SAFE NOW.
YOU'RE SAFE.

02:19.350 --> 02:20.863
NO, I'M NOT!

02:20.920 --> 02:23.138
QUINN: I'M NOT!

02:48.380 --> 02:51.292
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
ABC STUDIOS, LLC AND CBS, INC.

02:58.960 --> 03:00.905
GARCIA: "A THING IS
NOT NECESSARILY TRUE

03:00.960 --> 03:03.827
BECAUSE A MAN DIES FOR IT."
OSCAR WILDE.

03:03.870 --> 03:05.781
PRENTISS: WHO REMEMBERS
THIS AGENT?

03:05.830 --> 03:07.388
I DO NOT.

03:07.440 --> 03:08.919
GARCIA: THAT'S
AGENT OWEN QUINN.

03:08.970 --> 03:10.528
HE WORKED HERE UNTIL
HE QUIT A YEAR AGO.

03:10.580 --> 03:12.389
LEWIS: HE WORKED
IN THE VIOLENT CRIMES
APPREHENSION PROGRAM

03:12.450 --> 03:16.363
ON THE 5th FLOOR,
BUT HE ASPIRED
TO BE A PROFILER.

03:16.410 --> 03:17.627
SO,
WHY'D HE QUIT?

03:17.670 --> 03:19.183
HE WAS CONVINCED
THERE WAS AN UNSUB
WE MISSED

03:19.240 --> 03:20.719
WORKING UP AND DOWN
THE NORTHEAST CORRIDOR.

03:20.760 --> 03:22.364
HE NAMED HIM
"THE STRANGLER.ll

03:22.410 --> 03:24.844
SIMMONS: NAMING THE
UNSUB. THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT WE DON'T DO.

03:24.900 --> 03:26.231
THAT WASN'T
HIS ONLY MISTAKE.

03:26.290 --> 03:27.769
LEWIS: YEAH, WE
REVIEWED HIS REPORT.

03:27.810 --> 03:29.243
HE STARTED WITH
A SINGLE VICTIM--

03:29.290 --> 03:30.803
A WOMAN IN MARYLAND
WHO'D BEEN STRANGLED

03:30.860 --> 03:33.328
AND HAD THE HYOID
BONE AT THE FRONT OF
HER THROAT REMOVED,

03:33.380 --> 03:34.859
BUT SHE WAS HIS ONLY
CONFIRMED VICTIM.

03:34.910 --> 03:37.071
OH, ONE MURDER
DOESN'T MAKE YOU
A SERIAL KILLER.

03:37.120 --> 03:38.678
YEAH, WE TOLD
HIM THAT.

03:38.740 --> 03:40.640
SO HE STARTED FORCING
MISSING PERSONS INTO
HIS VICTIMOLOGY

03:40.690 --> 03:42.385
TO FIT HIS PROFILE.

03:42.430 --> 03:45.649
LEWIS: IN THE END, 5 OF
HIS 7 VICTIMS SHOWED UP
ALIVE AND UNHARMED,

03:45.700 --> 03:47.429
2 WERE INCONCLUSIVE.

03:47.480 --> 03:50.267
FIRST SIN OF PROFILING.
TRYING TO FIT THE EVIDENCE
TO MATCH A THEORY.

03:50.310 --> 03:52.699
QUINN TOOK THE CRITICISM
PERSONALLY AND QUIT,

03:52.750 --> 03:54.308
SAID HE'D PURSUE
THE INVESTIGATION
ON HIS OWN.

03:54.360 --> 03:56.134
THAT'S A LITTLE
IMPULSIVE.

03:56.190 --> 03:57.669
SO, HOW DID WE
FIND HIM IN
THE STORAGE UNIT?

03:57.710 --> 04:00.361
I GOT AN E

04:00.410 --> 04:01.798
YOU HATE E-MAIL.

04:01.850 --> 04:03.624
I DO. I WAS EVEN
MORE SURPRISED

04:03.670 --> 04:05.274
WHEN I SAW THAT IT WAS
AN ANONYMOUS SENDER.

04:05.330 --> 04:07.719
REID: GARCIA, CAN YOU PUT
THE MESSAGE ON THE BOARD?

04:11.680 --> 04:13.375
THAT'S QUINN'S
FBI ID BADGE.

04:13.420 --> 04:14.808
THAT'S A BIG
PIECE OF BAIT.

04:14.860 --> 04:16.725
I MEAN,
THE UNSUB KNOWS
WE HAVE TO TAKE IT.

04:16.770 --> 04:19.034
SOMEONE LEFI' US BREADCRUMBS
TO A FORMER FEDERAL AGENT,

04:19.080 --> 04:20.513
WHO SURE AS HELL
LOOKED DEAD.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.289
SIMMONS: SO DID THE UNSUB
THINK HE WAS DEAD

04:22.340 --> 04:23.557
WHEN HE LEFI' HIM
THERE FOR US,

04:23.610 --> 04:25.999
OR WAS HE LEAVING US
SOME KIND OF WITNESS?

04:26.040 --> 04:27.348
ROSSI: OR TO PUT IT
ANOTHER WAY,

04:27.390 --> 04:29.779
IS THIS GUY TRYING
TO HELP US OR TAUNT US?

04:29.830 --> 04:31.650
PRENTISS: RIGHT NOW,
QUINN HAS ALL
THE ANSWERS.

04:31.700 --> 04:34.692
REID WILL INTERVIEW HIM.
LUKE, TARA, GO TO THE
STORAGE UNIT,

04:34.750 --> 04:36.229
SEE WHAT
YOU CAN UNCOVER.

04:36.270 --> 04:38.738
MA'IT, J.J., I NEED YOU
TO REACH OUT TO HIS
WIFE AND SON.

04:41.100 --> 04:42.704
HEY...

04:42.760 --> 04:44.148
TELL ME NOT TO WORRY.

04:44.190 --> 04:45.316
ABOUT WHAT?

04:45.370 --> 04:47.019
YOU GOT AN E

04:47.060 --> 04:49.938
OK, MAYBE I'LL
BUY THAT. MAYBE.

04:49.980 --> 04:53.154
BUT WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST CALL THE REST OF US?

04:53.200 --> 04:56.328
AND WHY TAKE A SWAT TEAM
TO A STORAGE UNIT

04:56.380 --> 04:57.722
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT?

04:57.770 --> 04:59.328
YOU'RE KEEPING
SECRETS, OK?

04:59.380 --> 05:01.109
AND WHEN YOU KEEP SECRETS,
I GET NERVOUS.

05:01.170 --> 05:02.558
BECAUSE THE LAST TIME--

05:02.600 --> 05:04.773
I WENT TO PRISON
FOR A MURDER THAT
I DIDN'T COMMIT.

05:04.820 --> 05:05.775
YEAH.

05:05.820 --> 05:07.902
SO...TELL ME
NOT TO WORRY.

05:07.950 --> 05:09.736
WHOEVER DID THIS
WANTED ME TO FIND
QUINN,

05:09.780 --> 05:11.566
AND I NEEDED
TO KNOW WHY.

05:11.610 --> 05:13.521
DO YOU EVEN
KNOW HIM THAT WELL?

05:13.570 --> 05:15.470
NO. I MEAN, I'VE
SEEN HIM IN THE BUILDING
OCCASIONALLY,

05:15.530 --> 05:17.486
BUT THAT JUST MADE
THE WHOLE THING WEIRDER.

05:17.530 --> 05:20.909
SO, I TOLD PRENTISS
THAT I NEEDED AN
EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCES

05:20.970 --> 05:22.312
EXEMPTION TO
THE SABBATICAL.

05:22.360 --> 05:26.353
SHE MADE IT HAPPEN,
AND...NOW YOU KNOW
EVERYTHING.

05:26.410 --> 05:28.401
EVERYTHING?

05:28.450 --> 05:30.759
EVERYTHING.

05:30.800 --> 05:32.017
ALL RIGHT.

05:41.420 --> 05:45.379
UH-UH. UH-UH.
UH-UH. UH-UH.

05:45.430 --> 05:47.773
UH-UH.
OWEN...

05:47.820 --> 05:49.424
OWEN, YOU'RE
IN QUANTICO NOW.

05:49.470 --> 05:52.906
THERE ARE 7 FLOORS
AND 200 AGENTS IN
THIS BUILDING ALONE.

05:52.960 --> 05:55.952
YOU ARE COMPLETELY
PROTECTED.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.820
DID YOU FIND
THE STRANGLER?

05:57.870 --> 06:00.259
NO, WE DIDN'T,
BUT WE FOUND YOU.

06:00.310 --> 06:01.823
THEN I'M NOT
PROTECTED!

06:04.450 --> 06:05.792
IS THAT WHY YOU TRIED
TO KILL YOURSELF?

06:05.840 --> 06:07.228
IT WAS THAT BAD?

06:12.500 --> 06:13.717
TELL ME ABOUT
YOUR INVESTIGATION.

06:13.760 --> 06:15.011
YOU FOUND SOMETHING.

06:15.070 --> 06:17.800
YOU FOUND SOMETHING
THAT WE MISSED. WHAT WAS IT?

06:17.850 --> 06:20.410
THE NEWS.

06:20.460 --> 06:23.418
HE REALLY LIKED
THE NEWS.

06:23.470 --> 06:25.938
THEN, LIKE NEWSPAPERS?

06:25.990 --> 06:28.424
THE NEWs.

06:28.470 --> 06:31.428
NEW LONDON...

06:31.470 --> 06:34.428
NEW HAVEN...

06:34.480 --> 06:35.822
NEWARK.

06:35.870 --> 06:37.826
THAT'S WHERE HE HUNTED.

06:37.870 --> 06:40.430
I PREDICTED HE WOULD
HIT NEW ROCHELLE NEXT.

06:42.960 --> 06:46.839
HE LIKED COLLEGE BARS.
HE LIKED HUNTING
IN THEM.

06:46.880 --> 06:49.485
SO I HUNTED FOR HIM,
AND THEN...

06:49.530 --> 06:52.055
AND THEN SHE
CAME UP TO ME.

06:52.100 --> 06:55.888
SHE GOT MY GUARD DOWN,
SLIPPED SOMETHING
IN MY DRINK...

06:55.930 --> 06:57.625
SHE?

06:57.670 --> 06:58.716
THEN THERE'S MORE
THAN ONE OF 'EM?

06:58.760 --> 07:00.239
MM-HMM.IT WAS A TEAM.

07:00.280 --> 07:02.020
IT WAS A MAN
AND A WOMAN?
MM-HMM.

07:02.070 --> 07:03.150
DID YOU GET THEIR NAMES?

07:03.200 --> 07:06.852
YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW BAD IT WAS.

07:06.900 --> 07:10.768
FROM THE MOMENT
I W-WOKE UP IN THEIR
HOUSE HOW BAD.

07:10.820 --> 07:11.855
UGH!

07:11.900 --> 07:13.640
WOMAN: YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE!

07:13.690 --> 07:16.420
THEO! LET'S GO,
LET'S GO, LET'S GO!

07:16.470 --> 07:17.994
TRAFFIC'S GONNA BE
A NIGHTMARE.

07:18.040 --> 07:20.861
HEY, DAD, CAN I BORROW
THE CAR TOMORROW NIGHT?

07:20.910 --> 07:22.912
ANOTHER DATE
WITH APRIL?

07:22.960 --> 07:24.860
THINGS ARE
GETTING SERIOUS

07:24.920 --> 07:26.569
I HOPE YOU'RE
TREATING HER

07:26.620 --> 07:27.871
WITH THE RESPECT
SHE DESERVES,
YOUNG MAN.

07:27.920 --> 07:30.912
GEEZ, DAD. YES.
BYE, MOM.
BYE.

07:45.940 --> 07:48.716
I THOUGHT WE'D NEVER
GET A MOMENT ALONE.

08:00.780 --> 08:02.554
AAAHH!

08:03.960 --> 08:05.769
THAT WAS JUST
THE BEGINNING.

08:05.830 --> 08:08.048
I LEARNED TO SURVIVE
BY PLAYING DEAD.

08:08.090 --> 08:12.129
I SLOWED DOWN
MY HEARTBEAT,

08:12.180 --> 08:14.523
MY BREATHING.

08:14.580 --> 08:16.969
THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY
I COULD GET THEM TO STOP.

08:17.010 --> 08:19.274
YOU GOT SO GOOD AT IT,
YOU FOOLED US LAST NIGHT.

08:19.320 --> 08:21.925
AND THE BOY...THEO.

08:21.970 --> 08:24.530
HIS NAME IS THEO.

08:24.590 --> 08:27.150
HE WOULD FEED ME
SOMETIMES.

08:27.200 --> 08:31.933
WHY WOULD THE PARENTS
RISK EXPOSING THEIR SON
TO A CAPTIVE LIKE YOU?

08:31.980 --> 08:33.379
I DON'T KNOW,
I DON'T KNOW.

08:33.420 --> 08:35.468
HE JUST--
HE FED ME SOMETIMES.

08:38.430 --> 08:41.854
HE TALKED TO ME
LIKE I WAS HUMAN.

08:41.910 --> 08:42.945
I BEGGED HIM
TO LET ME GO,

08:43.000 --> 08:45.901
BUT HE COULDN'T
DEFY THEM.

08:45.960 --> 08:48.087
OH, GOD...

08:49.610 --> 08:52.602
OH, GOD...
GOD...

08:56.010 --> 08:57.966
AND YOU THINK
WE'RE BEING PLAYED?

08:58.010 --> 08:59.875
YOU TELL ME
IF YOU BUY THIS--

08:59.930 --> 09:01.659
A HUSBAND-AND-WIFE
KILLING TEAM

09:01.710 --> 09:03.018
RAISING A SUN IN THE
MIDDLE OF SUBURBIA

09:03.060 --> 09:04.709
LIKE OZZIE
AND HARRIET.

09:04.760 --> 09:07.979
FAKING TRAUMA.
THAT'S A DANGEROUS GAME
TO PLAY AGAINST PROFILERS.

09:08.020 --> 09:09.669
WHAT'S HE TRYING
TO HIDE FROM US?

09:09.720 --> 09:12.974
HE COULD BE COVERING
FOR WHOEVER LOCKED HIM
IN THAT STORAGE UNIT.

09:13.030 --> 09:14.588
MY MIND GOES
TO THE STRANGLER.

09:14.640 --> 09:18.019
AND THERE'S MORE
GOING ON BETWEEN THEM
THAN HE'S LETTING ON.

09:18.070 --> 09:19.594
YOU KNOW WHERE
MY MIND GOES...

09:19.640 --> 09:21.460
TO SERIAL KILLERS
LIKE TONY COSTA,

09:21.510 --> 09:23.592
ISRAEL KEYES,
FRED WEST.

09:23.650 --> 09:27.029
SUSPECT S WHO KILLED
THEMSELVES ONCE THEY
WERE TAKEN INTO CUSTODY.

09:27.080 --> 09:28.388
LIKE QUINN TRIED TO DO
LAST NIGHT.

09:28.430 --> 09:30.034
YOU THINK MAYBE
HE'S THE STRANGLER?

09:30.090 --> 09:31.899
I THINK WE LEAVE
ALL THEORIES ON THE TABLE

09:31.960 --> 09:33.473
UNTIL WE VERIFY HIS STORY.

09:33.520 --> 09:35.602
AND I THINK WE VERIFY
HIS STORY BY GOING BACK

09:35.660 --> 09:37.616
TO WHERE IT STARTED.

09:39.880 --> 09:42.007
SO FAR, WE CAN TELL YOU
THAT THE UNIT WAS RENTED

09:42.050 --> 09:43.836
IN QUINN'S NAME
2 DAYS AGO,

09:43.880 --> 09:45.313
ALL PAID FOR IN CASH.

09:45.360 --> 09:46.884
SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE
CAUGHT FOOTAGE

09:46.930 --> 09:48.886
OF A HOODED MALE
HEFI'ING QUINN

09:48.930 --> 09:51.057
AND EVERYTHING ELSE
INTO THE UNIT
ON THAT SAME DAY.

09:51.110 --> 09:52.759
WE SENT IT OVER
TO GARCIA,

09:52.800 --> 09:53.846
BUT IT'S
TOO GRAINY TO ID.

09:53.890 --> 09:55.585
WHAT ELSE HAVE YOU
FOUND IN THERE?

09:55.630 --> 09:58.804
LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE
STUFFED AN ENTIRE GIRL'S
DORM ROOM IN HERE--

09:58.850 --> 10:00.852
LEWIS: LINENS, CLOTHES...

10:00.900 --> 10:02.856
READS TO US
AS YOUNG AND FEMALE.

10:02.900 --> 10:04.948
SO, SOMEONE WITH
THE PHYSICAL STRENGTH

10:04.990 --> 10:07.857
TO CARRY QUINN AROUND
ALSO PACKS UP HIS DAUGHTER'S--

10:07.910 --> 10:10.731
OR HIS GIRLFRIEND'S
COLLEGE DORM ROOM.

10:10.780 --> 10:11.860
PRENTISS:
WHAT'S THE PA'I'I'ERN HERE?

10:11.910 --> 10:13.866
WE'RE ASKING OURSELVES
THE SAME QUESTION.

10:13.910 --> 10:15.309
PRENTISS: KEEP US POSTED
ON WHAT YOU FIND.

10:15.350 --> 10:16.510
ALL RIGHT.
WILL DO.

10:19.570 --> 10:21.526
OH, MY GOD, ALVEZ.
I GOT SOMETHING.

10:21.570 --> 10:23.526
WHAT?

10:23.570 --> 10:24.878
YOUR MOM.

10:24.920 --> 10:26.649
OH, REALLY. MOM JOKES?

10:26.710 --> 10:27.927
WAIT UNTIL YOU MEET HER,

10:27.970 --> 10:29.312
AND YOU SAY THAT, RIGHT,

10:29.360 --> 10:31.885
BECAUSE WHAT SHE'S GONNA
DO IS CRUSH YOU

10:31.930 --> 10:33.659
WITH JUST A LOOK.

10:33.720 --> 10:34.880
YOU SEE THAT LOOK?

10:34.930 --> 10:37.239
THAT'S MY MOM.

10:37.280 --> 10:39.896
I ALREADY FEEL THE NEED
TO APOLOGIZE FOR
BREAKING CURFEW

10:39.940 --> 10:41.544
AND NOT CLEANING
UP MY ROOM.

10:41.590 --> 10:43.023
YOU SHOULD.

10:45.940 --> 10:48.374
WHOA.OH, COME ON, TARA,
NOT AGAIN.

10:48.430 --> 10:49.852
I'M GONNA NEED
AN EVIDENCE BAG.

10:49.910 --> 10:51.946
ACTUALLY,
I'M GONNA NEED 7.

10:53.430 --> 10:54.943
HYOID BONES.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.558
QUINN SAID THE STRANGLER
REMOVED THESE

10:56.610 --> 10:59.568
FROM THE NECKS OF HIS VICTIMS
AND KEPT THEM AS TROPHIES.

11:01.180 --> 11:02.693
ALVEZ: THEY'VE GOT
DATES ON THEM.

11:02.740 --> 11:03.911
ALL RIGHT. I'M GONNA HAVE
GARCIA RUN THESE DATES

11:03.960 --> 11:05.746
AGAINST HIS WHEREABOUTS.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.439
I MEAN, EITHER QUINN'S
THE UNLUCKIEST AGENT

11:07.490 --> 11:09.958
IN THE HISTORY OF
THE BUREAU, OR...

11:10.010 --> 11:11.614
HE'S THE GUILTIEST.

11:19.720 --> 11:20.880
HI. ARE YOU SHANE?

11:20.940 --> 11:22.714
YEAH.

11:22.760 --> 11:25.024
I'M SSA JENNIFER JAREAU
WITH THE FBI.

11:25.070 --> 11:26.981
THIS IS SSA
MA'I'I' SIMMONS.

11:27.030 --> 11:28.065
IS YOUR MOM HOME?

11:28.120 --> 11:29.633
MOM?

11:32.990 --> 11:36.812
SHANE:
I KNEW IT. I JUST KNEW.

11:36.870 --> 11:38.599
KNEW WHAT?

11:38.650 --> 11:41.778
THAT HE WOULDN'T
WALK OUT ON US,
LIKE MOM SAID.

11:41.830 --> 11:44.253
HE WAS A GREAT DAD.
HE WOULDN'T DO THAT.

11:45.440 --> 11:48.955
SO...CAN I SEE HIM?

11:49.010 --> 11:51.228
WELL, THAT'S WHY
WE'RE HERE.

11:51.270 --> 11:52.749
UM...

11:52.790 --> 11:55.748
BUT WE NEED TO WARN YOU
THAT HE MIGHT NOT BE
THE SAME MAN

11:55.800 --> 11:57.142
THAT YOU REMEMBER.

11:57.190 --> 12:00.751
WHY?

12:00.800 --> 12:02.665
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?

12:02.720 --> 12:04.108
WOMAN: WHAT HAPPENED
TO HIM?

12:04.150 --> 12:05.276
WHAT ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME?

12:05.330 --> 12:07.366
WHAT DID HAPPEN?

12:07.420 --> 12:10.025
HE BECAME OBSESSED
WITH THAT CASE.

12:10.070 --> 12:11.241
THE STRANGLER?

12:13.030 --> 12:15.988
HE STARTED THINKING
LIKE HIM.

12:16.030 --> 12:18.942
HE SAID THAT'S HOW
HE'D GET INTO THE
MIND OF A MADMAN.

12:21.080 --> 12:22.251
IT ENDED WITH HIM--

12:26.870 --> 12:28.997
DID HE HURT YOU?

12:29.050 --> 12:30.699
NO...

12:32.050 --> 12:33.699
BUT HE WANTED TO.

12:35.400 --> 12:38.870
HE WANTED TO...
CHOKE ME,

12:38.930 --> 12:41.706
TO KNOW HOW IT FELT.

12:41.760 --> 12:46.663
HE KEPT ASKING,
DEMANDING...

12:46.720 --> 12:48.199
SO I KICKED HIM
OUT OF THE HOUSE.

12:48.240 --> 12:51.494
I FILED FOR DIVORCE,
AND I NEVER
SAW HIM AGAIN.

12:51.550 --> 12:53.108
SHANE IS OFFERING
TO COOPERATE.

12:53.160 --> 12:56.061
NO! ABSOLUTELY NOT!

12:56.120 --> 12:59.203
WELL, HE'S 18, AND HE
DOESN'T NEED ANYONE'S
PERMISSION.

13:00.950 --> 13:06.126
FINE. LET ME GRAB
MY PURSE.

13:06.170 --> 13:09.037
ALL RIGHT, OWEN.
I WANT YOU TO PAINT ME
A PICTURE,

13:09.090 --> 13:11.695
AND I WANT YOU TO JUST
FOCUS ON THE DETAILS...

13:11.740 --> 13:14.049
OK, THE MUNDANE,
THE DAY-IN AND THE DAY-OUT.

13:14.090 --> 13:18.094
IT'S GONNA KEEP YOU
FROM FEELING OVERWHELMED.

13:18.140 --> 13:20.700
DID THEY KEEP YOU IN
THE LIVING ROOM FOR
THE ENTIRE YEAR?

13:20.750 --> 13:23.218
NO.

13:23.280 --> 13:26.272
THEY MOVED ME...
TO THE BASEMENT.

13:26.320 --> 13:27.969
ALL RIGHT, DESCRIBE
THE BASEMENT.

13:28.020 --> 13:32.366
COLD...
NO WINDOWS...

13:32.420 --> 13:33.842
ECHO-Y...

13:33.900 --> 13:35.936
BECAUSE I SCREAMED,

13:35.980 --> 13:37.709
SCREAMED SO MUCH.

13:37.770 --> 13:39.374
HOW DID THEY FEED YOU?

13:39.420 --> 13:40.762
THEO DID.

13:48.040 --> 13:49.689
[RATI'LES CHAIN;
PATS BACK]

13:49.740 --> 13:51.162
PLEASE, DON'T GO.
DON'T GO.

13:51.220 --> 13:52.733
I HAVE TO.

13:52.780 --> 13:54.122
THEY'LL GET SUSPICIOUS.

13:57.790 --> 13:59.872
WAS THERE A TOILET?

13:59.920 --> 14:02.138
THERE WAS A BUCKET.

14:06.230 --> 14:09.757
I KNEW A NEW DAY HAD
BEGUN WHEN THEY WOULD
COME DOWNSTAIRS

14:09.800 --> 14:11.756
AND ASK ME
THE SAME QUESTIONS.

14:11.800 --> 14:13.108
HOW DID YOU FIND US

14:13.150 --> 14:15.755
HOW'D YOU DO IT?
TELL US, QUINN.

14:15.810 --> 14:17.152
TELL US, AND WE'LL
STOP HURTING YOU.

14:17.200 --> 14:20.328
TELL US, SO WE CAN
GET AWAY WITH MURDER.

14:28.120 --> 14:29.291
[CHAIR SCRAPES FLOOR,
HITS TABLE]

14:29.340 --> 14:31.126
THEY WERE ALREADY
GETI'ING AWAY WITH MURDER.

14:31.170 --> 14:33.161
AND YOU'RE NOT A PROFILER;
YOU WERE IN ViCAP.

14:33.220 --> 14:36.257
MAYBE I HAD VALUE
AS A HOSTAGE.
I DON'T KNOW.

14:37.130 --> 14:40.304
GOD, HER PERFUME--
IT ALMOST CHOKED ME,
IT WAS SO STRONG.

14:40.350 --> 14:42.739
WHOSE PERFUME?
THE WIFE'S? WHAT
DID IT SMELL LIKE?

14:42.790 --> 14:44.348
I CAN'T--
I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT.

14:44.400 --> 14:46.482
OWEN, YOU JUST SAID
IT CHOKED YOU. WHY
CAN'T YOU DESCRIBE IT?

14:46.530 --> 14:47.872
WHAT, DO YOU THINK
I'M LYING? DO YOU
THINK I DID THIS?

14:47.930 --> 14:49.704
NO. YOU KNOW WHAT
I THINK, OWEN?
I THINK THAT YOU

14:49.750 --> 14:52.014
HAVEN'T GIVEN ME
A SINGLE PIECE OF EVIDENCE
THAT VALIDATES YOUR STORY.

14:52.060 --> 14:53.573
EVIDENCE?

14:53.630 --> 14:55.109
HERE'S MY EVIDENCE.

14:57.850 --> 14:59.408
ALL RIGHT. TH EO.

14:59.460 --> 15:01.064
THEO. THEIR SON.

15:01.110 --> 15:02.668
YOU SAID THAT HE
TREATED YOU LIKE A HUMAN.

15:02.720 --> 15:04.199
YES.

15:04.250 --> 15:05.763
HE TALKED TO ME.

15:05.810 --> 15:07.539
WHAT DID HE TALK
TO YOU ABOUT?

15:07.600 --> 15:09.283
COLLEGE.
WHICH ONE?

15:09.340 --> 15:10.853
I DON'T KNOW.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.719
IS THERE ANYTHING
THAT YOU DO KNOW?

15:12.780 --> 15:14.907
I ASKED HIM.
HE WOULDN'T TELL ME.

15:14.950 --> 15:17.908
INSTEAD, HE'D ASK ME
QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS
COURSEWORK.

15:17.960 --> 15:21.919
"HOW DO YOU FIND
AN ANCHOR POINT
IN A GEOPROFILE?"

15:21.960 --> 15:26.044
"WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN FIXATED AND
REGRESSIVE TYPOLOGY?"

15:26.090 --> 15:27.967
HE WAS TAKING CLASSES
IN PROFILING.

15:28.010 --> 15:29.910
DID HE ASK YOU ABOUT
RE-OFFENSE STATISTICS

15:29.970 --> 15:31.926
FOR FEMALE
SEXUAL OFFENDERS?

15:31.970 --> 15:34.928
YES! EXACTLY.

15:34.970 --> 15:36.961
HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT?

15:37.020 --> 15:39.409
BECAUSE I TAUGHT IT.

15:39.460 --> 15:41.803
THEO WAS IN MY CLASS
AT MARBURY UNIVERSITY.

15:41.850 --> 15:43.977
THAT'S HOW HE GOT MY E-MAIL.
I INCLUDED IT IN THE SYLLABUS.

15:44.030 --> 15:47.329
OK...THERE ARE 9

15:47.380 --> 15:50.543
TH EO AND TH EODORES
ENROLLED AT MARBURY.

15:50.600 --> 15:51.988
NONE OF THEM
ARE ENROLLED
IN YOUR CLASS.

15:52.030 --> 15:53.110
REID: TOO MUCH
OF A PAPER TRAIL.

15:53.160 --> 15:55.162
HE WAS MOST LIKELY
JUST AUDITING.

15:59.430 --> 16:02.558
REID, FAINTLY: IT'S EXPERIENCE
BY AN OFFENDER THAT PRECIPITATES
SUBSEQUENT BEHAVIOR,

16:02.610 --> 16:05.568
WHEREAS A STRESSOR
IS A LONGER-TERM PA'I'I'ERN

16:05.610 --> 16:08.784
OF BEHAVIOR OR
CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH PUSH

16:08.830 --> 16:12.618
A PERSON INTO BEHAVING
DIFFERENTLY THAN
THEY NORMALLY WOULD.

16:17.100 --> 16:18.704
HIM.

16:18.760 --> 16:19.966
GARCIA: THEO HOLSTON.
ON IT.

16:21.190 --> 16:22.532
OK, GUYS, LET'S
TALK THIS THROUGH.

16:22.590 --> 16:24.194
WE NEED TO MAKE
THIS MAKE SENSE.

16:24.240 --> 16:25.969
WELL, ONE THEORY IS
THAT QUINN HAS BEEN
THE KILLER ALL ALONG.

16:26.020 --> 16:28.978
THEO SOMEHOW TRAPPED HIM,
LEFI' HIM IN THE STORAGE
UNIT FOR ME TO FIND,

16:29.030 --> 16:32.158
AND QUINN'S POST-TRAUMATIC
DECOMPENSATION ACT
IS JUST THAT--IT'S AN ACT.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.987
REID: HIS BEHAVIOR DOESN'T
MATCH SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN
TRAUMATIZED FOR A YEAR.

16:35.030 --> 16:36.986
OR QUINN'S TELLING
THE TRUTH.

16:37.030 --> 16:38.588
THEO PUT HIM IN THERE
TO FRAME HIM,

16:38.640 --> 16:40.551
PROBABLY UNDER
HIS PARENTS' ORDERS.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.989
OK. THEO HOLSTON'S PARENTS
ARE JERRY AND DONNA HOLSTON.

16:43.040 --> 16:45.907
JERRY IS AN INSURANCE
SALESMAN, JUST GOT
"EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH."

16:45.960 --> 16:47.518
DONNA'S A HOUSEWIFE,
NO CRIMINAL RECORD.

16:47.570 --> 16:49.959
REID: NOT EXACTLY
THE PSYCHOPATHIC TEAM
THAT QUINN PAINTED.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.433
ALEXANDRIA'S
A SHORT DRIVE.

16:51.480 --> 16:53.391
REID, I WANT YOU
TO STAND DOWN.

16:53.440 --> 16:55.044
ALVEZ AND SIMMONS
WILL LEAD ON THIS.

17:03.760 --> 17:05.011
OPEN DOOR RIGHT!

17:08.070 --> 17:09.674
START YOUR
SEARCH.

17:12.680 --> 17:14.807
REAR OF THE HOUSE IS CLEAR.

17:14.850 --> 17:16.021
WE'RE CLEAR.

17:16.070 --> 17:18.675
OVER HERE.

17:22.690 --> 17:24.032
HEY, LUKE!

17:35.140 --> 17:37.483
SIMMONS: LOOKS LIKE
HE CHANGED HIS M.O.

17:37.530 --> 17:39.043
WHERE'S THEO?

17:43.710 --> 17:45.666
THAT'S A .40 CALIBER
SHELL.

17:45.710 --> 17:48.053
THAT WAS QUINN'S
PERSONAL BACKUP WEAPON.

17:48.110 --> 17:51.068
HE KEPT IT EVEN AFI'ER
HE TURNED IN HIS BADGE.

17:51.110 --> 17:54.671
SO, WHOEVER KILLED
THESE TWO...

17:54.720 --> 17:56.506
THEY USED QUINN'S GUN
TO DO IT.

18:07.600 --> 18:09.204
THAN KS.
APPRECIATE IT.

18:10.740 --> 18:13.129
SO, THE LANDS
AND GROOVES MATCH
TO QUINN'S GUN?

18:13.170 --> 18:15.218
YEAH, THEY DO.

18:15.260 --> 18:16.568
YOU THINK
HE DID IT?

18:16.610 --> 18:18.168
WE'VE GOT WHAT
HIS WIFE SAID ABOUT HIM.

18:18.220 --> 18:20.176
BONES ALL AROUND HIM,
HIS GUN USED TO KILL

18:20.220 --> 18:22.484
ALL THE VICTIMS
IN THE BASEMENT?
UM, YEAH.

18:24.100 --> 18:25.704
HOW DO YOU SQUARE
THE FACT THAT

18:25.750 --> 18:28.184
THEIR KID WENT TO
REID'S CLASS?

18:28.230 --> 18:30.278
THAT'S A HELL OF
A COINCIDENCE.

18:30.320 --> 18:33.448
HE'S ALMOST CERTAINLY
THE ONE THAT PUT QUINN
IN THE STORAGE UNIT.

18:33.500 --> 18:35.491
I MEAN, WHEN WE DO FIND
HIM, WE CAN ASK HIM WHY.

18:48.910 --> 18:52.732
BY THE WAY, AREN'T
YOU THE ONE THAT THOUGHT
QUINN WAS PLAYING US?

18:52.780 --> 18:55.601
YEAH, THAT WAS ME.

18:55.650 --> 18:58.301
THIS CASE...

18:58.350 --> 19:00.306
DOESN'T ADD UP.

19:00.350 --> 19:03.911
LIKE THE COMMENT
QUINN SAID TO REID.

19:03.960 --> 19:07.396
"HER PERFUME--
IT CHOKED ME.
IT WAS SO STRONG."

19:07.450 --> 19:10.010
LINGUISTIC PROFILE
WOULD CALL THAT LEAKAGE.

19:10.060 --> 19:11.311
I MEAN, THE USE
OF THE WORD "CHOKE,"

19:11.360 --> 19:13.408
IT'S A SUBCONSCIOUS
ADMISSION OF GUILT.

19:13.450 --> 19:15.236
THEY INVENTORIED
THIS WHOLE PLACE.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.885
THERE WASN'T A DROP
OF PERFUME IN IT.

19:19.500 --> 19:20.842
DOESN'T ADD UP.

19:28.950 --> 19:30.281
COME IN.
HI.

19:30.340 --> 19:32.900
AGENT PRENTISS?
I'M SPECIAL
AGENT MEADOWS.

19:32.950 --> 19:34.258
FROM ViCAP?

19:34.300 --> 19:37.906
I HAVE OWEN'S--UH,
AGENT QUINN'S FILE

19:37.950 --> 19:39.906
ON THE STRANGLER
THAT YOU REQUESTED.

19:39.960 --> 19:41.302
THANK YOU.
MARY, RIGHT?

19:41.350 --> 19:43.306
RIGHT THERE IS FINE.

19:45.310 --> 19:50.225
UM, I'M SORRY,
BUT I HAVE
SOMETHING TO SAY,

19:50.270 --> 19:52.261
AND IT'S NOT JUST ME.

19:52.320 --> 19:54.311
CLOSE THE DOOR.

20:10.330 --> 20:13.288
WELL, ROSSI'S ON ONE OF HIS
"DOESN'T ADD UP" TEARS.

20:13.340 --> 20:15.331
UH-OH.

20:15.380 --> 20:16.688
YEAH.

20:16.730 --> 20:19.335
I'M GUESSING HE'S
NOT THE ONLY ONE.

20:25.570 --> 20:27.822
CAN'T SEE IT...

20:27.870 --> 20:30.395
IN THIS CASE.
I MEAN, IS HE A SUSPECT,

20:30.440 --> 20:31.782
OR IS HE A VICTIM?

20:31.830 --> 20:34.651
THE WORST PART IS,
I CAN'T SEE WHY
I CAN'T SEE IT.

20:36.320 --> 20:37.969
I DON'T REMEMBER
QUINN QUITI'ING.

20:38.010 --> 20:40.399
ONE DAY HE WAS HERE,
THE NEXT HE WASN'T.

20:40.450 --> 20:44.887
SO...I WENT BACK TO
SEE WHEN THAT WAS,

20:44.930 --> 20:47.979
AND I FOUND OUT
IT WAS 2 WEEKS AFTER

20:48.020 --> 20:50.978
YOU WERE ARRESTED
FOR MURDER.

20:51.030 --> 20:52.804
YOU KNEW THAT,
DIDN'T YOU?

20:52.860 --> 20:54.020
IT'S NOT CONNECTED.

20:54.070 --> 20:56.288
BUT YOUR RATIONAL BRAIN
IS TELLING YOU THAT,

20:56.340 --> 20:57.466
AND THAT PART'S RIGHT.

20:57.510 --> 20:59.978
I ALSO KNOW THERE IS
A PART OF YOU

21:00.040 --> 21:01.985
THAT YOU DON'T
SHOW ANYONE.

21:02.040 --> 21:05.999
AND THAT PART OF YOU
IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

21:06.040 --> 21:08.474
WHY DID SPENCER REID
GET OUT OF HIS PRISON,

21:08.520 --> 21:10.385
YOU KNOW,
WHEN QUINN DIDN'T.

21:12.610 --> 21:16.000
THE ANSWER IS FAMILY...

21:16.050 --> 21:19.008
THIS FAMILY...

21:19.060 --> 21:22.359
WE FOUGHT
TO GET YOU OUT OF THERE,

21:22.410 --> 21:26.312
THE SAME WAY WE FOUGHT
TO SAVE PRENTISS
FROM MR. SCRATCH.

21:26.370 --> 21:29.453
WE FOUGHT TO SAVE
THIS TEAM FROM
GETTING SHUT DOWN.

21:29.500 --> 21:32.549
AND NOW, FAMILY WILL
HELP US FIGURE OUT
WHAT WE'RE MISSING.

21:32.590 --> 21:33.898
HOW?

21:33.940 --> 21:37.023
QUINN'S FAMILY
IS DOWNSTAIRS.

21:37.070 --> 21:40.551
HOW HE RESPONDS TO
THEM COULD REALLY
TELL US WHO HE IS.

21:54.660 --> 21:55.866
NO!

21:58.010 --> 21:59.432
JUST DON'T.

22:03.100 --> 22:04.442
ALL RIGHT.

22:07.280 --> 22:08.440
DAD.

22:14.110 --> 22:16.328
I THOUGHT I'D
NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN.

22:19.460 --> 22:21.064
GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF HIM!

22:21.120 --> 22:23.076
NO, WAIT!
DON'T! THEO!

22:23.120 --> 22:26.169
SHANE: MOM!
WHO'S THEO

22:26.210 --> 22:27.859
TH EO!SHANE: WHO'S TH EO?

22:27.910 --> 22:30.515
OK, WE ALL WANT A PROFILE
THAT EXPLAINS EVERYTHING,

22:30.560 --> 22:33.085
WRAPS EVERYTHING UP
NEATLY, BUT WE DON'T
HAVE THAT HERE.

22:33.130 --> 22:36.429
PRENTISS: SO, INSTEAD,
I'D LIKE TO HEAR
EVERYONE'S BEST THEORIES,

22:36.480 --> 22:38.436
AND WE'RE GONNA REBUILD THIS
CASE FROM THE GROUND UP.

22:38.480 --> 22:40.436
SIMMONS: WELL, QUINN AS
THE STRANGLER STILL GETS
MY VOTE.

22:40.480 --> 22:42.220
I MEAN, START WITH
HOW HE TREATED HIS WIFE.

22:42.270 --> 22:44.090
IT'S TEXTBOOK
PRECURSOR BEHAVIOR.

22:44.140 --> 22:45.573
LEWIS: OK, THEN WHEN
HE WORKED HERE,

22:47.140 --> 22:49.096
AND WHEN HE FELT
CONFIDENT HE COULD
GET AWAY WITH IT,

22:49.150 --> 22:50.663
HE QUIT TO KILL
WITH IMPUNITY.

22:50.710 --> 22:53.099
UNTIL THEO CAUGHT HIM
FOR US.

22:53.150 --> 22:54.708
THAT'S WHERE I TAP OUT.

22:54.760 --> 22:56.625
A 19-YEAR-OLD KID
GETS THE DROP

22:56.670 --> 22:58.456
ON AN EXPERIENCED
FBI AGENT?

22:58.500 --> 23:00.058
THE AGENT'S ALSO
A SERIAL KILLER

23:00.110 --> 23:02.806
WHO JUST KILLED THE
KID'S PARENTS? NO.

23:02.850 --> 23:05.375
SO WHAT'S YOUR
THEORY, ROSSI?

23:05.420 --> 23:06.546
I DON'T HAVE ONE.

23:06.600 --> 23:07.988
REID: LET'S
CONSIDER THIS.

23:08.030 --> 23:10.078
QUINN JUST CALLED
HIS OWN SON "THEO."

23:10.120 --> 23:11.462
CLASSIC EXAMPLE
OF PARAPRAXIS.

23:11.520 --> 23:12.817
A FREUDIAN
SLIP.

23:12.860 --> 23:14.168
REID: LITERALLY DEFINED
AS AN UNCONSCIOUS WISH

23:14.210 --> 23:15.552
OR SUBDUED DESIRE.

23:15.610 --> 23:17.475
SO, WHY, IN THE MIDDLE
OF AN EMOTIONAL RECONNECT ION

23:17.520 --> 23:19.249
WITH HIS OWN FLESH AND BLOOD

23:19.310 --> 23:20.868
WOULD HE CALL OUT
SOMEONE ELSE'S NAME?

23:20.920 --> 23:22.694
HE BUILT
A BOND WITH THEO.

23:22.740 --> 23:24.526
THAT MAY BE BORN
FROM STOCKHOLM SYNDROME?

23:25.790 --> 23:28.008
COULD YOU ALL
FOLLOW ME, PLEASE?

23:28.050 --> 23:30.928
PRENTISS:
YOU ALL KNOW THE ViCAP
TEAM FROM THE 5th FLOOR?

23:30.970 --> 23:32.528
ONCE THEY HEARD ABOUT
OUR INVESTIGATION,

23:32.580 --> 23:35.140
THEY ASKED US TO CONSIDER
SOME NEW INFORMATION
ABOUT QUINN.

23:35.190 --> 23:36.703
GO AHEAD, MARY.

23:36.760 --> 23:40.275
WE JUST--WE WANTED
TO SAY WE WORKED
WITH OWEN,

23:40.330 --> 23:41.718
SIDE-BY-SIDE, AN D--

23:41.760 --> 23:43.159
HE WASN'T A KILLER.

23:43.200 --> 23:44.974
MAN: ECCENTRIC,
MAYBE OBSESSED,

23:45.030 --> 23:46.713
BUT NOT A KILLER.

23:46.770 --> 23:47.896
SECOND MAN: I SAT NEXT
TO HIM FOR 3 YEARS.

23:47.940 --> 23:49.498
HE WAS A DEDICATED
PUBLIC SERVANT.

23:49.550 --> 23:51.336
HE BELIEVED IN WHAT
WE DID HERE.

23:51.380 --> 23:53.689
SIMMONS: WELL, IF HE WAS
SO DEDICATED TO THE FBI,
THEN WHY DID HE QUIT?

23:53.730 --> 23:55.459
WOMAN: HE THOUGHT
HE COULD SAVE LIVES.

23:55.520 --> 23:57.511
HE COULDN'T JUST
LET THE STRANGLER
KEEP KILLING.

23:57.560 --> 23:59.687
AND THE VICTIMS
HE THOUGHT HE FOUND,

23:59.740 --> 24:02.345
THEY WERE COLLEGE-AGE KIDS,
A LITTLE OLDER THAN
HIS OWN SON.

24:02.390 --> 24:04.733
HE COULDN'T STAND
THE IDEA OF THOSE PARENTS

24:04.790 --> 24:06.178
NOT KNOWING WHAT
HAPPENED TO THEIR CHILD.

24:06.220 --> 24:08.609
WOMAN:
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT, THE
UNSUB'S HUNTING GROUND--

24:08.660 --> 24:10.969
NEW HAVEN, NEW ROCHELLE,
NEW BRUNSWICK--

24:11.010 --> 24:12.489
HE WAS RIGHT ON.

24:12.530 --> 24:14.998
MEADOWS: AND WE GET IT.
WE'RE NOT THE
PROFILERS. YOU ARE.

24:15.060 --> 24:19.269
BUT IF HE WAS A PSYCHOPATH,
WE WOULD HAVE NOTICED.

24:19.320 --> 24:20.662
THANK YOU.

24:25.590 --> 24:27.581
ROSSI: ALL RIGHT.
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY

24:27.640 --> 24:31.189
FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT
WE TAKE QUINN'S STORY
AT FACE VALUE.

24:31.250 --> 24:33.593
WHAT DOES THAT
LEAVE US WITH?

24:33.640 --> 24:34.982
TH EO.

24:35.030 --> 24:37.555
MAYBE HE'S NOT A KILLER,
BUT HE'S INVOLVED,

24:37.600 --> 24:39.204
AND HE'S GONE
OUT OF HIS WAY TO
STAY OFF OUR RADAR.

24:39.260 --> 24:41.603
HEY, GARCIA, LOOK UP
THEO'S CLASSMATES
AT MARBURY,

24:41.650 --> 24:42.947
AND FOCUS ON
THE NAME "APRIL."

24:43.000 --> 24:44.342
ACCORDING TO QUINN, THAT
WAS HIS GIRLFRIEND'S NAME.

24:44.390 --> 24:46.210
THEY HAVE MET ON CAMPUS.

24:46.260 --> 24:49.787
HELLO, GORGEOUS.
APRIL PEARSON TOOK A
LINGUISTICS CLASS WITH THEO.

24:49.830 --> 24:53.220
SHE LIVES IN AN APARTMENT
JUST OFF-CAMPUS...

24:53.270 --> 24:54.749
WHICH SHE JUST MOVED OUT OF.

24:54.790 --> 24:56.655
LEWIS: WELL, THAT WOULD
EXPLAIN THE ADDITIONAL
BELONGINGS

24:56.710 --> 24:58.223
WE FOUND AT THE
STORAGE UNIT WITH QUINN.

24:58.270 --> 25:00.795
OK, WE NEED TO FIND HER.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

25:00.840 --> 25:02.626
I NEED TO TALK TO HIM.

25:05.320 --> 25:06.662
WHERE IS APRIL?

25:06.720 --> 25:08.540
WHO?

25:08.590 --> 25:10.979
THEO DIDN'T JUST HIDE YOU.
HE HID HER, TOO.

25:11.030 --> 25:12.713
WHERE IS SHE?

25:16.990 --> 25:19.379
I HAD TO.

25:22.730 --> 25:24.334
WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT
THE PERFUME--

25:24.390 --> 25:27.348
HOW IT WAS SO STRONG,
IT CHOKED YOU--

25:27.390 --> 25:28.698
YOU WEREN'T TALKING
ABOUT THE WIFE.

25:28.740 --> 25:29.957
YOU WERE TALKING
ABOUT APRIL.

25:40.270 --> 25:41.749
QUINN: WHAT?

25:41.800 --> 25:42.869
WHAT IS THIS?

25:42.930 --> 25:44.886
JERRY:
IT'S TIME FOR
THEO'S FINAL TEST.

25:44.930 --> 25:46.921
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!
DAD! DAD, NO!

25:46.980 --> 25:48.709
OH, JUST
AS WE THOUGHT.

25:48.760 --> 25:50.716
YOU TURNED HIM INTO
YOUR PET, HAVEN'T YOU?

25:50.760 --> 25:52.193
WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS?

25:52.240 --> 25:54.367
BECAUSE IT'S TIME
FOR YOU TO MAKE A CHOICE--

25:54.420 --> 25:56.411
A CHOICE THAT STARTS
WITH THE ACCEPTANCE

25:56.460 --> 25:59.020
THAT THERE IS A KILLER
INSIDE EVERYONE. EVERYONE.

25:59.070 --> 26:00.719
HERE, I'LL SHOW YOU.

26:02.860 --> 26:04.851
KILL THE GIRL.

26:06.780 --> 26:08.941
SHE'S STANDING IN THE WAY
OF OUR SON'S POTENTIAL.

26:10.780 --> 26:12.771
NO!

26:12.830 --> 26:14.343
THEN WE WILL
KILL THEO,

26:14.390 --> 26:16.438
THEN HER,
THEN YOU.

26:40.460 --> 26:41.802
I'M SORRY.

26:43.380 --> 26:44.768
AGGGHH!

26:44.820 --> 26:47.459
[COUGHING
AND CHOKING]

26:52.480 --> 26:56.905
QUINN: THE NEXT THING I KNOW,
I WOKE UP IN THE STORAGE UNIT.

26:59.130 --> 27:01.007
WE FOUND YOUR CAPTORS
DEAD IN THE BASEMENT.

27:01.050 --> 27:02.563
I THINK I KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

27:02.620 --> 27:04.963
THEO: CAN WE DO IT
QUICKLY, AT LEAST?

27:12.930 --> 27:14.795
THAT'S WHY THEO'S
IN HIDING FROM US.

27:14.850 --> 27:16.454
HE KILLED HIS OWN PARENTS.

27:17.940 --> 27:21.285
GARCIA JUST MATCHED
JERRY HOLSTON'S
TRAVEL FOR WORK

27:21.330 --> 27:23.935
WITH ABDUCT IONS
IN NEW LONDON, NEW HAVEN,
AND NEW ROCHELLE.

27:23.990 --> 27:26.800
THE DATES ON THE BONES
WERE A PERFECT MATCH.

27:26.860 --> 27:29.465
YOU WERE TELLING US
THE TRUTH THE WHOLE TIME,

27:29.510 --> 27:30.818
AND THEO WAS GIVING US
THE EVIDENCE TO PROVE IT.

27:30.860 --> 27:33.852
JAREAU: EXCEPT THEO WAS RAISED
BY TWO PSYCHOPATHS.

27:33.910 --> 27:35.559
AND NOW THAT
HE'S KILLED THEM...

27:35.610 --> 27:36.907
WHO KNOWS WHAT
HE'S GONNA DO NEXT.

27:36.950 --> 27:40.511
MAN: WHAT DO YOU MEAN
SHE WON'T SLEEP?

27:44.090 --> 27:46.524
OK, OK, WE'VE...

27:49.580 --> 27:52.538
YEAH. PUT HER ON THE PHONE.

27:56.230 --> 27:57.925
HI, HONEY.

27:59.500 --> 28:01.058
MAN:
MOM SAYS YOU DON'T
WANT TO GO TO SLEEP.

28:01.110 --> 28:02.361
WHAT'S--WHAT'S--WHY
NOT? TELL YOU WHAT.

28:02.410 --> 28:03.843
YOU GO TO SLEEP
RIGHT NOW,

28:03.890 --> 28:05.289
'CAUSE
TOMORROW MORNING
WHEN YOU WAKE UP--

28:05.330 --> 28:07.855
EXCUSE ME.
CAN YOU TELL ME--

28:10.550 --> 28:13.724
UHH!

28:13.770 --> 28:17.558
UHH...UHH...
UHH...

28:22.570 --> 28:23.901
UHH!

28:38.760 --> 28:40.318
SECURITY FOOTAGE
POSITIVELY IDd THEO.

28:40.370 --> 28:41.712
HE'S DEFINITELY
OUR GUNMAN.

28:41.760 --> 28:43.318
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
I'M THINKING BANG

28:43.370 --> 28:46.271
AND THEN BANG--
VICTIM NUMBER 2 FALLS HERE.

28:46.330 --> 28:49.026
THEO WALKS UP,
PULLS THE TRIGGER
WITH NO HESITATION.

28:49.070 --> 28:50.458
COLD.

28:50.510 --> 28:52.319
POST-TRAUMATIC
SNAP, MAYBE.

28:56.080 --> 28:59.299
REMINDED HIM OF THAT,
AND IT FITS THE PROFILE.

28:59.340 --> 29:01.388
POOR GUY TRIED TO
CRAWL AWAY.

29:01.430 --> 29:04.729
LEWIS: QUINN SAID THE
STRANGLER'S WIFE BURNED
OFF HIS FINGERPRINTS.

29:04.780 --> 29:07.738
BUT AM I CRAZY,
OR IS THIS GUY
MISSING THEM, TOO?

29:10.440 --> 29:12.749
TARA'S NOT CRAZY.

29:12.790 --> 29:14.439
ACCORDING TO THE M.E.,
BOTH VICTIMS HAD

29:14.490 --> 29:17.527
THEIR PRINTS BURNED OFF,
MOST LIKELY WITH
HYDROCHLORIC ACID.

29:17.580 --> 29:20.743
SO, WHAT DO WE KNOW
ABOUT THESE TWO?

29:20.800 --> 29:24.179
OH, NO WALLETS,
NO CELL PHONE ON HIM.

29:24.240 --> 29:27.585
WE LOOKED OVER HIS PHONE.
HADN'T BEEN ACTIVATED.

29:34.290 --> 29:36.758
HE HAD AN EARBUD IN.

29:36.810 --> 29:38.766
THEY'RE FAKING IT.

29:38.820 --> 29:40.811
SO THESE VICTIMS
WEREN'T RANDOM AT ALL.

29:40.860 --> 29:42.725
THEY WERE
STALKING THEO.

29:42.780 --> 29:45.385
WITHOUT WEAPONS.

29:45.430 --> 29:47.955
SO, THE PLAN MUST HAVE
BEEN TO OVERWHELM HIM,

29:48.000 --> 29:50.389
TAKE HIM TO
A SECONDARY LOCATION.

29:50.440 --> 29:54.399
BUT THIS APPROACH...
THE 2-ON-1, NO IDs,

29:54.440 --> 29:56.089
IT FEELS ALMOST
PARAMILITARY.

29:59.840 --> 30:02.138
AND INVITE A HUSBAND-
AND

30:02.190 --> 30:05.660
WELL, WHOEVER THEY ARE,
THEY ARE THE REASON THAT
THEO'S BEEN SO HARD TO FIND.

30:05.710 --> 30:07.792
HE'S NOT HIDING FROM US.

30:07.840 --> 30:09.842
HE'S HIDING FROM THEM.

30:09.890 --> 30:12.404
HELP ME PROFILE THIS.

30:12.460 --> 30:13.848
LET'S START WITH APRIL.

30:13.890 --> 30:15.369
TELL ME EVERYTHING
YOU CAN ABOUT HER.

30:17.460 --> 30:22.636
I CAN ONLY TELL YOU
WHAT THEO FELT SAFE
TELLING ME.

30:22.690 --> 30:25.500
THAT WAS THAT YOUNG
LOVE, YOU KNOW,

30:25.560 --> 30:29.428
THE KIND YOU ONLY
FEEL WHEN YOU'RE
19 OR 20.

30:29.470 --> 30:32.826
MADE ME WONDER
IF I'D SURVIVE TO
SEE MY SON THAT HAPPY.

30:32.870 --> 30:34.952
THAT'S WHY SHE WAS
A THREAT TO TH EO'S PARENTS.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.434
SHE SHOWED HIM THAT THERE
WAS A WORLD OUTSIDE OF
THEIR INSANITY.

30:37.480 --> 30:39.823
TO DO THAT, SHE--

30:39.880 --> 30:41.222
WHAT?

30:41.270 --> 30:42.703
WHEN WE FOUND YOU
IN THE STORAGE UNIT,

30:42.750 --> 30:44.092
YOU WERE SURROUNDED
BY HER THINGS.

30:44.140 --> 30:46.358
THAT TELLS ME THAT
THEO DIDN'T JUST
DO THIS FOR YOU.

30:46.400 --> 30:48.356
I SUPPOSE.
I DON'T REALLY KNOW.

30:48.410 --> 30:49.832
I MEAN, THINK ABOUT
HIS STATE OF MIND RIGHT NOW.

30:49.890 --> 30:52.495
HE HAS NO RESOURCES,
HE HAS NO PLACE TO GO,

30:52.540 --> 30:56.146
EXCEPT SOMEPLACE
WHERE HE KNOWS
HE'LL NEVER BE FOUND.

30:56.200 --> 30:58.361
A PLACE SHE SHOWED HIM.

30:58.420 --> 31:03.892
HE SAVED HER LIFE.
NOW SHE'S GONNA SAVE HIS.

31:03.940 --> 31:05.464
IF THEY'RE ON THE RUN
FROM SOME GROUP THAT'S
HUNTING THEM,

31:05.510 --> 31:07.944
THEY WOULDN'T GO TO
A PLACE TIED TO HIS
HISTORY.

31:07.990 --> 31:09.855
NO. THEY'D GO TO A PLACE
TIED TO HERS.

31:09.910 --> 31:12.595
PRENTISS:
GARCIA, WHAT DIRECTION
WAS THAT TRAIN GOING?

31:12.650 --> 31:13.867
UH, THE BLUE LINE--SOUTH.

31:13.910 --> 31:15.252
REID: IT TERMINATES
IN SPRINGFIELD.

31:15.300 --> 31:16.858
LOOK FOR ANY CONNECTION
TO HER IN THAT AREA--

31:16.910 --> 31:18.866
A SECOND APARTMENT,
A FAMILY HOME.

31:18.920 --> 31:20.433
IF YOU CAN'T
FIND ANYTHING,
KEEP GOING SOUTH.

31:20.480 --> 31:21.879
GARCIA: BOOYAH.
APRIL'S GRANDFATHER

31:21.920 --> 31:25.390
OWNS A CABIN ON LAKE ACCOTINK.

31:25.440 --> 31:26.748
GOOD PLACE TO HIDE OUT

31:26.790 --> 31:27.870
FROM WHOEVER'S STILL
AI-TER THEM.

31:27.920 --> 31:29.262
WE CAN GET TO THEM
FIRST.

31:29.320 --> 31:31.925
WE CAN, BUT WE HAVE TO
KEEP SWAT OUTSIDE THE DOOR.

31:31.970 --> 31:34.928
TH EO AND APRIL ARE PARANOID,
BELIEVING CORRECT LY THAT
THEY'RE BEING HUNTED.

31:34.980 --> 31:36.049
WE HAVE TO DEFUSE THEM.

31:36.110 --> 31:37.532
WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN MIND?

31:53.170 --> 31:54.853
TH EO, IT'S ME.

31:54.910 --> 31:56.161
YOU GOT MY MESSAGE?

31:56.210 --> 31:57.905
I DID, YES.

32:02.700 --> 32:03.917
YOU MADE IT!

32:11.580 --> 32:13.445
DID YOU GET THEM,
ALL OF THEM?

32:13.490 --> 32:15.538
THAT'S THE ONLY WAY
WE'RE SAFE IS IF
THEY'RE ALL GONE.

32:15.580 --> 32:18.538
ALL OF WHOM?

32:18.580 --> 32:21.845
OH, MY GOD!
YOU DON'T KNOW.

32:22.980 --> 32:24.459
THEO, THEY DON'T KNOW!

32:24.500 --> 32:26.024
HOW COULD YOU NOT KNOW?

32:26.070 --> 32:27.105
I LEI-T YOU ALL THE CLUES
IN THE STORAGE UNIT.

32:27.160 --> 32:28.980
WE KNOW YOUR FATHER
WAS THE STRANGLER

32:29.030 --> 32:30.930
AND THAT HE KILLED 7 VICTIMS,
AND WE KNOW THAT YOUR
MOTHER HELPED.

32:30.990 --> 32:32.412
NO, NO.

32:32.470 --> 32:35.200
HOW CAN YOU NOT SEE THIS?
HOW COULD YOU MISS THIS?

32:35.250 --> 32:36.501
WHAT DID WE MISS?

32:36.560 --> 32:38.516
MY FATHER DIDN'T
KILL THEM.
HE ABDUCTED THEM,

32:38.560 --> 32:40.471
AND THEN HE HANDED THEM
OVER TO THE MESSIAH.

32:40.520 --> 32:42.033
TH E M ESSIAH?

32:42.090 --> 32:44.558
THEO: AND THEN THE
MESSIAH WOULD KILL THEM
IN FRONT OF US,

32:44.610 --> 32:47.431
HIS FOLLOWERS,
TO INSPIRE US.

32:47.480 --> 32:52.304
DON'T YOU SEE? THIS
ISN'T ONE SERIAL KILLER
OR A COUPLE.

32:52.360 --> 32:53.748
IT'S A CULT.

33:26.870 --> 33:28.690
PROVE YOUR ALLEGIANCE.

33:41.100 --> 33:43.011
UHH!

33:43.060 --> 33:45.790
AAH! AAH!

33:45.840 --> 33:48.013
AAAAHH! AAAHHH!

34:00.080 --> 34:02.036
GOOD.

34:02.080 --> 34:04.776
NOW LISTEN CLOSELY

34:04.820 --> 34:07.129
BECAUSE THE END IS NIGH.

34:17.490 --> 34:19.003
REID: GIVE ME A SENSE
OF HOW BIG THIS CULT IS.

34:19.050 --> 34:20.438
HOW MANY PEOPLE
ARE IN IT?

34:20.490 --> 34:22.617
I NEVER SAW MORE THAN
A HANDFUL OF 'EM AT A TIME.

34:22.660 --> 34:25.788
THE FACES ALWAYS CHANGED.
THAT'S HOW THE MESSIAH
LIKED IT.

34:25.840 --> 34:27.796
AND THIS MESSIAH--
WHO IS HE?

34:27.840 --> 34:30.058
HIS NAME IS
BENJAMIN MERVA.

34:30.110 --> 34:32.499
AND WHAT ABOUT THIS GROUP?
WHAT DO THEY CALL THEMSELVES?

34:34.590 --> 34:36.546
THE BELIEVERS,
BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE

34:36.590 --> 34:38.023
THEY COULD
INHERIT THE EARTH.

34:39.590 --> 34:41.148
YOU KNOW ABOUT
ANY OF THIS?

34:41.200 --> 34:43.339
NO. NOTHING.

34:45.300 --> 34:47.689
COULD YOU DO
SOMETHING FOR ME,

34:47.730 --> 34:49.641
WHEN THIS IS ALL OVER?

34:52.220 --> 34:55.303
LEWIS: THE BELIEVERS WERE
A SMALL GROUP OBSESSED
WITH THE END TIMES,

34:55.350 --> 34:56.738
SIMILAR TO HEAVEN'S GATE.

34:56.790 --> 34:58.564
VIOLENT?JUST THE OPPOSITE.

34:58.610 --> 35:00.566
THEY PREPARED THEMSELVES
BY FASTING, MEDITATION,

35:00.620 --> 35:02.099
GIVING AWAY THEIR
EARTHLY POSSESSIONS.

35:02.140 --> 35:03.619
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE--

35:03.660 --> 35:05.184
THE HOLSTONS JOINING UP
WITH A GROUP THAT ARE

35:05.230 --> 35:06.572
BASICALLY A BUNCH
OF PACIFISTS.

35:06.620 --> 35:08.315
SIMMONS: MAYBE THEY
STOPPED BEING PACIFISTS

35:08.360 --> 35:10.578
AI-TER THEIR PREDICTION
ABOUT THE END OF THE
WORLD DIDN'T COME TRUE.

35:10.630 --> 35:12.666
I MEAN, THAT'S WHEN A CULT
WOULD TEND TO DESTABILIZE,

35:12.710 --> 35:16.146
AND IT'S EASIER FOR A VIOLENT
OR CHARISMATIC PERSONALITY
TO TAKE OVER.

35:16.200 --> 35:17.406
THE MESSIAH NEEDS TO
BE OUR FOCUS.

35:17.460 --> 35:18.711
WHAT DO WE KNOW
ABOUT HIM?

35:18.760 --> 35:20.102
GARCIA: HE HAS NO CRIMINAL
OR ONLINE RECORD.

35:20.160 --> 35:22.116
I'M SEARCHING FOR LOCATIONS
TIED TO HIM NOW.

35:22.160 --> 35:25.209
IF HE KILLED 7 PEOPLE,
HE'S PROBABLY KEEPING
A LOW PROFILE.

35:25.250 --> 35:26.899
SIMMONS: YEAH, BUT
HE'S STILL ATTRACT ING
FOLLOWERS SOMEHOW,

35:26.950 --> 35:29.077
MOST LIKELY MEN WHO GET
TURNED ON BY WATCHING

35:29.120 --> 35:30.678
HIM KILL IN FRONT
OF AN AUDIENCE.

35:30.730 --> 35:32.209
SO, IT'S NOT
JUST A CULT.

35:32.260 --> 35:34.205
IT'S A CULT OF
POTENTIAL SERIAL
KILLERS.

35:34.260 --> 35:35.602
ROSSI: EXACTLY THE KIND
OF CROWD THEO'S PARENTS

35:35.650 --> 35:37.345
WOULD WANT TO HANG OUT WITH.

35:37.390 --> 35:40.780
GARCIA, CAN YOU
POINT US IN A DIRECTION
WHERE MERVA WOULD BE NOW?

35:40.830 --> 35:43.344
YEAH. HE BOUGHT A WAREHOUSE
ON THE EDGE OF THE DISTRICT.

35:43.400 --> 35:45.618
GARCIA: NOT THE KIND OF
PLACE I'D GO TO CHURCH,

35:45.660 --> 35:47.742
BUT IDEAL IF HUMAN SACRIFICE
IS YOUR THING.

35:47.790 --> 35:49.007
IF WE CAN ARREST
THE CULT LEADER,

35:49.050 --> 35:50.392
WE CAN STOP
THE CULT. LET'S GO.

36:13.340 --> 36:14.682
SHH...

36:22.700 --> 36:24.474
PRENTISS: FBI!
SHOW US YOUR HANDS.

36:25.700 --> 36:27.656
BENJAMIN DAVID MERVA,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST

36:27.700 --> 36:29.520
FOR THE MURDER
OF 7 PEOPLE.

36:29.570 --> 36:31.128
WHERE ARE YOUR
FOLLOWERS, BEN?

36:31.180 --> 36:33.000
OH, I HAVE NO FOLLOWERS...

36:33.060 --> 36:34.664
ONLY STUDENTS.

36:34.710 --> 36:37.270
AND WHAT YOU SEE
IS ALL I HAVE.

36:56.380 --> 36:58.291
MAY I HAVE
EVERYONE'S ATTENTION?

36:58.340 --> 37:00.945
METRO P.D. AND THE BUREAU
HAVE BEEN MADE AWARE
OF THE BELIEVERS

37:01.000 --> 37:04.470
AND POSSIBLE ACTIVITY
FOLLOWING THEIR
LEADER'S ARREST,

37:04.520 --> 37:06.647
BUT TAKING THEO
AT HIS WORD--

37:06.700 --> 37:08.691
WELL, WE ARRESTED 3. THERE'S
PROBABLY MORE OUT THERE.

37:08.740 --> 37:10.526
BUT IF THEY FOLLOW
CULT DYNAMICS,

37:10.570 --> 37:11.878
THEY'LL BREAK DOWN
WITHOUT THE MESSIAH.

37:11.920 --> 37:14.309
TYPICAL CULT. YOU THINK
IT'S A CAST OF THOUSANDS,

37:14.360 --> 37:16.703
WHEN REALLY IT'S JUST
4 WACKOS SITTING AROUND
IN THE DARK.

37:16.750 --> 37:19.833
I THINK WE DESERVE
SOME DECOMPRESSION TIME,

37:19.880 --> 37:22.053
AND ROSSI IS KIND
ENOUGH TO HOST.

37:22.100 --> 37:24.443
ROSSI: AND I HAVE
SOME TOP-SHELF WINE
PICKED

37:24.500 --> 37:26.229
JUST FOR THE OCCASION.

37:26.280 --> 37:28.419
YES! OK, I HAVE TO DO
A SYSTEMS CHECK.

37:28.460 --> 37:29.711
PLEASE DO NOT HAVE
TOO MUCH FUN WITHOUT ME.

37:29.760 --> 37:31.580
I WILL
MEET YOU ALL THERE

37:36.510 --> 37:39.024
UNFORTUNATELY, I DON'T
THINK I'M GONNA BE ABLE
TO MAKE IT TONIGHT.

37:39.080 --> 37:41.719
TELL ME NOT TO WORRY.

37:41.780 --> 37:43.771
DON'T. I'M GOOD.
I'M REALLY GOOD.

37:43.820 --> 37:45.731
OK. WELL...

37:45.780 --> 37:48.032
IT'S NOT FAMILY
WITHOUT YOU THERE.

37:48.090 --> 37:52.129
I KNOW. THERE'S ANOTHER
FAMILY THAT COULD USE
MY HELP RIGHT NOW.

37:52.180 --> 37:53.659
AH.

37:58.180 --> 37:59.488
WHAT'S THIS FOR?

37:59.530 --> 38:02.317
IT'S FOR ALL THE TIMES
YOU WORRIED ABOUT ME.

38:02.360 --> 38:03.793
I NEVER SAID THANK YOU.

38:03.840 --> 38:05.398
THANK YOU.

38:06.800 --> 38:08.495
YOU'RE WELCOME.

38:22.430 --> 38:24.113
IS MY DAD COMING?

38:24.170 --> 38:26.297
HE'S FINISHING UP
HIS FINAL DEBRIEF
INTERVIEW.

38:26.340 --> 38:28.774
I'LL KEEP YOU COMPANY
UNTIL HE COMES DOWN.

38:28.820 --> 38:30.993
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT
HAPPENED TO HIM NOW?

38:32.830 --> 38:35.344
FIRST THING THAT
YOU NEED TO KNOW IS

38:35.400 --> 38:39.393
THAT YOUR FATHER
IS A HERO.

38:41.840 --> 38:43.831
[LAUGHTER;
TALKING INDISTINCT LY]

38:47.410 --> 38:49.571
ALVEZ: OK.LEWIS: IT'S TRUE.

38:49.630 --> 38:50.619
SHUT UP.

38:50.670 --> 38:51.921
IT'S TRUE!

38:51.980 --> 38:53.789
THERE ARE ACTUAL
SEXUAL POSITIONS

38:53.850 --> 38:55.841
THAT PRODUCE
UGLY BABIES?

38:55.890 --> 38:57.710
YES. IT'S BEEN PROVEN.

38:57.770 --> 38:59.806
WELL, BY WHO?

38:59.850 --> 39:01.329
YOUR MOM?

39:03.550 --> 39:04.812
OH HO! ALL RIGHT.

39:04.860 --> 39:06.896
YOU WANT A WAR?
I WILL BRING IT.

39:06.950 --> 39:09.418
IT'S ON.COME AT ME, BRO.

39:09.470 --> 39:11.426
ROSSI: EMILY, PLEASE.
LET IT GO.

39:11.470 --> 39:13.904
I KNOW. MAYBE IT'S
THE CURSE OF BEING
TEAM LEADER,

39:13.960 --> 39:15.860
BUT SOMETHING IS
BUGGING ME ABOUT THIS.

39:15.910 --> 39:17.821
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT BUGS ME.

39:17.870 --> 39:20.395
WE FOUND A CULT LEADER
BUT NO CULT.

39:20.440 --> 39:23.398
THAT'S NOT IT.
I MEAN, THAT'S IT,
BUT THAT'S NOT IT.

39:23.440 --> 39:24.873
WELL, WHAT IS IT,
THEN?

39:24.920 --> 39:27.878
IN THE WAREHOUSE
WHERE WE ARRESTED
THE MESSIAH,

39:27.930 --> 39:30.353
THERE WERE THESE
PETRI DISHES ON THE FLOOR

39:30.410 --> 39:32.310
FILLED WITH
HYDROCHLORIC ACID.

39:32.370 --> 39:34.144
JAREAU: PERFECT FOR
BURNING OFF FINGERPRINTS.

39:34.190 --> 39:36.841
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT THE
DRUG LORD EL CHAPO DID
IN MEXICO.

39:36.890 --> 39:38.846
PRENTISS: AND BASED ON
THE TWO DEAD GUYS
IN THE SUBWAY,

39:38.890 --> 39:41.154
MAYBE THAT WAS
THEIR INITIATION.

39:41.200 --> 39:43.668
YOU WANT TO JOIN,
YOU BURN OFF
YOUR FINGERPRINTS.

39:46.940 --> 39:48.282
WHERE YOU GOING
WITH THIS?

39:48.340 --> 39:51.468
IT'S JUST ONE
NAGGING QUESTION.

39:51.510 --> 39:54.035
WHY DID THEY BURN OFF
QUINN'S FINGERPRINTS?

39:54.080 --> 39:55.866
WELL, THEY
TORTURED HIM.

39:55.910 --> 39:57.468
WITH THEIR
INITIATION RITE?

39:57.520 --> 39:59.033
I MEAN, MAYBE, BUT--

39:59.090 --> 40:02.173
OR MAYBE WE SOMEHOW
MISREAD QUINN ALL THIS TIME.

40:02.220 --> 40:07.874
MAYBE THERE WAS CULT PROGRAMMING
THEO DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT.

40:07.920 --> 40:09.911
WHAT IF THEY
DID CONVERT HIM?

40:09.970 --> 40:12.359
AND WE LEI-T HIM
IN THE BUILDING

40:12.410 --> 40:14.799
WHERE THE MESSIAH IS
BEING HELD IN CUSTODY.

40:14.840 --> 40:16.489
JAREAU: ALL RIGHT,
I'LL CALL SPENCE AND GARCIA.

40:16.540 --> 40:19.532
GUYS, WE NEED TO GET BACK
TO QUANTICO RIGHT NOW.

40:21.280 --> 40:22.622
RIGHT THIS WAY,
OWEN.

40:22.680 --> 40:24.489
YOUR SON IS WAITING
FOR YOU DOWNSTAIRS.

40:24.550 --> 40:25.972
GARCIA: OH, WAIT!
UH...

40:26.030 --> 40:27.986
THIS PHONE, THIS PHONE,
THIS PHONE.

40:28.030 --> 40:29.930
GARCIA: J.J.?
I AM ON MY WAY.

40:29.990 --> 40:31.594
ARGH! LOST HER.

40:31.640 --> 40:33.119
SO, I WILL TEXT.

40:33.160 --> 40:35.549
"J.J.,
I'M ON MY WAY."

40:37.210 --> 40:39.906
I KNEW YOU DIDN'T
DO IT. I JUST KNEW.

40:39.950 --> 40:41.952
AND I CAN'T TELL YOU
WHAT A PRIVILEGE IT'S BEEN

40:42.000 --> 40:43.695
WORKING WITH THE A-TEAM
ON THIS CASE.

40:43.740 --> 40:46.959
"A
OHH... A-TEAM.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.696
AND OWEN, IF WE
TIME THIS RIGHT,

40:49.750 --> 40:52.742
YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY
GET OUT OF HERE
BEFORE THE SUNRISE.

40:54.750 --> 40:56.923
DRAW YOUR GUN.

40:56.970 --> 40:59.279
WHAT?
DRAW YOUR GUN!

41:02.060 --> 41:03.186
HEY, J.J., WHAT'S UP?

41:03.240 --> 41:04.753
WHAT WAS THAT?

41:07.460 --> 41:08.939
STAY HERE.

41:15.030 --> 41:16.463
PUT YOUR HANDS UP,
QUINN!

41:22.300 --> 41:23.733
WHAT HAPPENED?

41:23.780 --> 41:25.384
IT'S HER.

41:25.430 --> 41:26.829
WHAT?

41:28.260 --> 41:29.568
SHE'S ONE OF THEM.

41:29.610 --> 41:30.781
MEADOWS: DROP YOUR
GUN, AGENT REID.

41:33.140 --> 41:34.698
IT'S BEEN YOU
THE WHOLE TIME.

41:34.750 --> 41:37.389
YES, IT WAS.

41:37.450 --> 41:39.441
QUINN SOMEHOW
FIGURED IT OUT FIRST.

41:39.490 --> 41:41.538
PITY HAVING TO
SHOOT HIM,

41:41.580 --> 41:44.401
BUT HE CAN'T GIVE ME
WHAT I WANT,
AND YOU CAN.

41:44.450 --> 41:45.849
WHAT'S THAT?

41:45.890 --> 41:47.050
YOU AND I ARE
GONNA GO UPSTAIRS

41:47.110 --> 41:48.327
AND FREE MY MESSIAH.

41:48.370 --> 41:49.712
YOU'RE IN THE HEART
OF THE FBI.

41:49.760 --> 41:51.409
AS SOON AS THE REST
OF MY TEAM FIGURES
OUT IT'S YOU,

41:51.460 --> 41:53.451
YOU'LL BE DEAD BEFORE
YOU'RE OUT THE DOOR.

41:53.510 --> 41:54.898
THEN WE NEED TO
WORK QUICKLY.

41:54.940 --> 41:57.249
I'M NOT COOPERATING
WITH YOU. MIGHT AS
WELL SHOOT ME.

41:57.290 --> 41:59.372
I HAVE A BETTER IDEA.

42:06.480 --> 42:09.825
NOW, WHAT'S IT
GONNA BE?

42:09.870 --> 42:13.397
BECAUSE YOU CAN
EITHER JOIN US,
OR SHE DIES.

42:20.320 --> 42:22.185
SPENCER, JUST SHOOT HER!
SHOOT HER!
