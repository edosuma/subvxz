00:59.184 --> 01:01.561
I was particularly thinking
about appeal.

01:01.644 --> 01:03.730
Like, what makes something appealing?

01:03.813 --> 01:05.815
Why are you drawn to something,

01:06.566 --> 01:10.111
and something else… "Meh, meh"?

01:10.195 --> 01:15.950
I noticed that my wife has got
this instinctual sense of harmony.

01:16.034 --> 01:20.163
We were sitting at the breakfast table,

01:20.246 --> 01:24.542
and there was a salt shaker,
and I just moved it just a little bit out.

01:25.168 --> 01:28.088
So she came back and sat down,
and we just started talking.

01:28.171 --> 01:30.548
And she just kinda went…
…put it back.

01:30.632 --> 01:33.885
And I said, "Why'd you do that?"
"Why'd I do what?"

01:33.968 --> 01:37.764
"Well, that. You just had to adjust
the salt shaker and the sugar bowl."

01:39.057 --> 01:42.727
"I don't know, it just feels better."
It's like, yes, see? That's it!

01:51.569 --> 01:54.948
<i>In animation,</i>
<i>we use this word, "appeal."</i>

01:55.865 --> 01:58.368
<i>And it means, well, a lot of things.</i>

01:58.451 --> 02:02.747
To me, a character
who is appealing must be imperfect.

02:02.831 --> 02:05.250
'Cause it doesn't mean
that it's cute or pretty.

02:06.376 --> 02:07.418
It's a mystery.

02:07.502 --> 02:10.213
<i>Most people associate it</i>
<i>with the Disney princesses</i>

02:10.296 --> 02:11.881
<i>or adorable animals.</i>

02:12.632 --> 02:14.008
<i>But it is deeper than that.</i>

02:14.634 --> 02:17.720
<i>And when it comes to artists,</i>
<i>we tend to use one definition.</i>

02:18.221 --> 02:22.225
If I had to say it simply,
I'd say, "Appeal is harmony."

02:24.727 --> 02:28.648
When we're creating art,
we are creating harmonic chords.

02:28.731 --> 02:33.486
And there's music to our drawings,
and you can hear it. You can feel it.

02:34.404 --> 02:35.738
<i>Think of it this way,</i>

02:35.822 --> 02:39.117
<i>there is a certain relationship</i>
<i>between all of the elements of a face.</i>

02:39.200 --> 02:42.787
<i>If I move Sailor Moon's eyes like this,</i>
<i>I'm creating an imbalance.</i>

02:43.580 --> 02:45.206
<i>Same if I were to move her nose.</i>

02:46.249 --> 02:47.876
<i>Every time I change one thing,</i>

02:47.959 --> 02:50.712
<i>I have to rebalance</i>
<i>her face to feel harmonious.</i>

02:51.379 --> 02:52.422
<i>That's appeal.</i>

02:53.131 --> 02:54.799
<i>Or take a look at Cruella de Vil.</i>

02:55.383 --> 02:57.802
<i>Her figure is made up</i>
<i>of triangles and squares.</i>

02:58.303 --> 03:02.098
<i>By contrast, her coat and hair are made up</i>
<i>of these sweeping curves.</i>

03:02.182 --> 03:05.101
<i>All together, these straights</i>
<i>and curves balance each other out.</i>

03:05.185 --> 03:06.936
<i>This is also appealing.</i>

03:07.020 --> 03:10.648
You can have an appealing monster

03:10.732 --> 03:14.986
that's communicating aggressiveness
and danger and anger.

03:15.069 --> 03:20.116
Or a little baby'sinnocence has got
appeal in its sweetness and openness.

03:20.200 --> 03:23.077
And it's more than just harmony.

03:23.161 --> 03:28.082
It's harmony with a message.
It's saying something to you.

03:28.166 --> 03:31.502
<i>Appeal is a universal concept</i>
<i>found across many cultures.</i>

03:32.212 --> 03:35.215
<i>It applies to heroes, villains,</i>

03:36.549 --> 03:39.802
<i>tiny soot sprites, a dot and a line.</i>

03:41.387 --> 03:43.681
<i>But over the years, something interesting</i>

03:43.765 --> 03:45.767
<i>has happened to female protagonists.</i>

03:46.351 --> 03:48.269
I think sometimes

03:49.312 --> 03:52.941
the word "appealing" gets misused

03:53.775 --> 03:56.277
to try to create perfection.

03:56.361 --> 04:01.407
When it comes to executives and marketing
and… and that kind of a thing, they…

04:02.533 --> 04:04.244
they get those two mixed up.

04:05.245 --> 04:08.998
Because, I think, they're looking
more to the business side of it

04:09.082 --> 04:11.209
and what will sell.

04:12.293 --> 04:15.088
If it's a… it's a female image,
it has to be beautiful.

04:15.880 --> 04:21.678
It's like, having the perfect hair,
the perfect design, the beauty,

04:21.761 --> 04:25.598
things that they consider to be appeal.

04:27.934 --> 04:31.521
When really, it's the appeal
of who the character is,

04:31.604 --> 04:34.357
and then you work that design around that.

04:35.108 --> 04:38.319
<i>Let's compare female characters</i>
<i>with their male counterparts.</i>

04:38.403 --> 04:41.614
<i>For men, you'll see a decent variety</i>
<i>of shapes and sizes.</i>

04:41.698 --> 04:45.702
<i>But for women, they tend to fall within</i>
<i>a much more narrow range of options.</i>

04:46.202 --> 04:49.038
<i>Usually, a round face</i>
<i>with big eyes and a small nose.</i>

04:49.664 --> 04:53.501
<i>There are some exceptions,</i>
<i>but there is also an overwhelming trend.</i>

04:54.002 --> 04:56.963
And I think we're beginning
to push out of that,

04:57.046 --> 05:02.051
but it's… it's hard, because the audience
has been conditioned to expect that.

05:02.719 --> 05:06.639
So… so it's gonna take a little bit,
but we're inching that way.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.558
<i>All of these designs have appeal.</i>

05:08.641 --> 05:12.186
<i>And just because they're popular</i>
<i>does not mean they lack artistic merit.</i>

05:12.270 --> 05:16.482
<i>The question is, why do so many stay</i>
<i>within a particular style of femininity?</i>

05:16.566 --> 05:19.986
<i>What's driving the decision?</i>
<i>Art or business?</i>

05:21.946 --> 05:24.949
<i>Every animated character is influenced</i>
<i>by this push and pull.</i>

05:25.491 --> 05:29.454
<i>Appeal is the end goal.</i>
<i>How we get there is a different story.</i>

05:35.918 --> 05:39.172
My full name would be
Luis Fernando Gadea Rodriquez.

05:39.255 --> 05:40.548
That's a Spanish name.

05:41.549 --> 05:43.926
I go with Luis Gadea. It's easier.

05:45.428 --> 05:49.849
The inspiration that I like the most
would be in the everyday.

05:50.933 --> 05:55.271
If I'm in the train,
every single person is a character.

05:55.355 --> 05:56.939
You see how they dress.

05:57.023 --> 06:01.819
You see the colors they use,
the shapes that they're defined with.

06:03.946 --> 06:07.992
And then I create a library
in my head of things

06:08.076 --> 06:10.328
that I could use for potential characters.

06:12.705 --> 06:18.044
In animation, it's always taught similar,
that you want round shapes.

06:18.127 --> 06:23.007
Very big eyes.
A specific space in between the eyes.

06:23.091 --> 06:27.637
And that defines, uh,
an appeal to the drawing, right?

06:28.388 --> 06:31.224
If you wanna go really cartoony,

06:31.307 --> 06:34.477
they push the head a lot, way bigger,

06:34.560 --> 06:38.356
which is sometimes even bigger
than the… the rest of the body, right?

06:40.191 --> 06:43.945
I learned that, that I should use curves.

06:44.028 --> 06:46.155
And yeah, it's true. It works.

06:46.239 --> 06:50.618
But can you get that appeal
with just straight lines?

06:50.701 --> 06:51.702
That's a challenge.

06:52.495 --> 06:54.372
<i>And that's the challenge today.</i>

06:54.455 --> 06:56.958
<i>We've asked Luis to help us design</i>
<i>a female character</i>

06:57.041 --> 07:00.044
<i>that uses some</i>
<i>of these straight and edgy elements.</i>

07:00.711 --> 07:03.756
<i>While he's doing that,</i>
<i>let's look at some of the basics.</i>

07:04.590 --> 07:08.177
<i>Designing a character starts out</i>
<i>by playing with basic shapes.</i>

07:08.886 --> 07:11.347
<i>This character's silhouette</i>
<i>is three circles.</i>

07:12.014 --> 07:15.935
<i>But if you change two of them</i>
<i>into triangles, now who is it?</i>

07:16.936 --> 07:20.314
<i>With a little rearranging,</i>
<i>these shapes can express different ideas.</i>

07:21.524 --> 07:24.026
<i>Sometimes an artist will use</i>
<i>one dominant shape.</i>

07:25.862 --> 07:28.156
<i>Other times, they'll combine</i>
<i>multiple shapes.</i>

07:29.657 --> 07:32.618
<i>A silhouette is an outline,</i>
<i>an idea of the character.</i>

07:33.327 --> 07:35.788
<i>But what really defines</i>
<i>a character is the line.</i>

07:36.456 --> 07:40.209
<i>A line can be straight, thin, thick,</i>

07:40.960 --> 07:42.670
<i>jagged, or curved.</i>

07:43.796 --> 07:45.715
<i>A line can convey personality.</i>

07:49.969 --> 07:51.137
<i>Or an emotion.</i>

07:54.807 --> 07:56.893
<i>The line can be used</i>
<i>to communicate everything</i>

07:56.976 --> 07:58.978
<i>from the simplistic to the complex.</i>

08:00.062 --> 08:02.106
<i>And every artist has their own approach.</i>

08:02.857 --> 08:08.446
Something I look for in my design is
to dramatize change of direction.

08:09.363 --> 08:15.661
A French curve is literally a… a curve
that starts here and rolls up this way

08:15.745 --> 08:20.208
and then goes down into a straight
and then into a curve again.

08:20.291 --> 08:23.419
A French curve is
in… in the design of a humerus…

08:25.505 --> 08:27.173
in the femur.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.384
It's all through nature, every tree.

08:31.302 --> 08:35.139
You draw a tree,
and it's actually spiraling upwards.

08:36.807 --> 08:39.393
It's just this beautiful, rhythmic curve.

08:40.728 --> 08:45.107
And it becomes the, uh… the building block
for appeal, I think.

08:46.108 --> 08:49.946
And you are discovering it
and applying it to… to your work.

08:54.242 --> 08:56.702
<i>So here are</i>
<i>three takes of our character.</i>

08:57.203 --> 08:58.371
<i>We've named her Clio.</i>

08:59.247 --> 09:02.750
<i>Now the question is,</i>
<i>which one do we like better?</i>

09:02.833 --> 09:04.168
Let's start with "A."

09:04.252 --> 09:07.713
On "A," I went
with a more exaggerated figure.

09:07.797 --> 09:11.259
You can tell the… the feet
are very long, right?

09:11.342 --> 09:12.969
And they have a specific shape.

09:13.636 --> 09:15.638
Let's go to "B."

09:15.721 --> 09:18.641
If you see the little sketch
on the side, it's based on a bottle.

09:18.724 --> 09:20.935
It has big hips, a straight line,

09:21.018 --> 09:24.605
and then it goes two straight lines
towards the end.

09:25.106 --> 09:30.778
And then for letter "C," I went
with a more, like, odd shape for the face.

09:30.861 --> 09:34.615
The ears, they have a more,
like, straight lines than curves.

09:34.699 --> 09:38.327
<i>After giving it some thought,</i>
<i>we've decided to go with option "B."</i>

09:38.411 --> 09:42.123
<i>And even though we like this version</i>
<i>of Clio, it's not quite there yet.</i>

09:42.206 --> 09:43.416
<i>So we have to give Luis…</i>

09:45.293 --> 09:51.382
As an artist, I need to be able to draw
that character X many times.

09:51.465 --> 09:55.094
Like, if I need to do it a hundred times,
I… I need to be able to do it.

09:55.928 --> 10:00.016
<i>Most of the notes we gave Luis</i>
<i>were to make Clio more animation-friendly.</i>

10:04.312 --> 10:06.439
You can do an exercise. It's tough.

10:06.522 --> 10:11.068
Do a very nice drawing
that you feel proud then just rip it up.

10:11.152 --> 10:12.903
Let's see if you could do that.

10:12.987 --> 10:15.698
If you are able to do that,
you're good to go.

10:16.324 --> 10:18.159
<i>After many tweaks</i>
<i>and many drawings,</i>

10:18.242 --> 10:20.620
<i>we have a version of Clio</i>
<i>that we're happy with.</i>

10:21.370 --> 10:23.497
<i>But there's something we're leaving out.</i>

10:23.581 --> 10:24.999
<i>Because in most situations,</i>

10:25.082 --> 10:27.918
<i>there's at least one other factor</i>
<i>that comes into play,</i>

10:28.669 --> 10:29.629
<i>merchandising.</i>

10:29.712 --> 10:32.423
That's one small step for man…

10:32.506 --> 10:35.718
<i>It's 1969,</i>
<i>and there's a new cartoon on ABC.</i>

10:38.554 --> 10:40.806
<i>It's called </i>Hot Wheels<i>,</i>
<i>and it's financed</i>

10:40.890 --> 10:42.224
<i>by the toy company Mattel.</i>

10:42.308 --> 10:44.477
<i>Other cartoons had corporate sponsors.</i>

10:44.560 --> 10:45.645
Busch does it.

10:45.728 --> 10:47.980
You can't say "beer" better than Busch.

10:48.064 --> 10:50.024
<i>But </i>Hot Wheels
w<i>as something different.</i>

10:50.107 --> 10:52.693
<i>It began as a toy</i>
<i>and then became a cartoon.</i>

10:52.777 --> 10:55.279
<i>The FCC criticized it</i>
<i>as a 30-minute commercial,</i>

10:55.363 --> 10:58.449
<i>and after two seasons, ABC canceled it.</i>

10:59.533 --> 11:03.412
<i>Twelve years later, a new head</i>
<i>of the FCC was appointed, Mark S. Fowler.</i>

11:03.496 --> 11:05.581
All these elements, networks, groups…

11:05.665 --> 11:07.625
<i>He deregulated</i>
<i>a lot of TV standards,</i>

11:07.708 --> 11:09.543
<i>including children's programming.</i>

11:09.627 --> 11:11.796
<i>So toy companies tried once again.</i>

11:11.879 --> 11:14.340
<i>First, with Strawberry Shortcake.</i>
<i>And then with…</i>

11:16.008 --> 11:18.427
<i>And the Masters of the Universe!</i>

11:18.511 --> 11:20.221
He-Man <i>was a smash hit</i>

11:20.304 --> 11:22.223
<i>and completely changed</i>
<i>the way cartoons were made.</i>

11:22.306 --> 11:24.558
<i>Now, a toy company</i>
<i>could come up with an idea</i>

11:24.642 --> 11:26.352
<i>and create a cartoon to sell it.</i>

11:26.435 --> 11:28.437
<i>In North America today,</i>

11:28.521 --> 11:31.148
<i>toys and cartoons are closely tied</i>
<i>together from the beginning.</i>

11:31.232 --> 11:32.650
<i>There's even a word for it.</i>

11:32.733 --> 11:34.777
How "toyetic" can you get?

11:34.860 --> 11:37.905
<i>"Toyetic" is a word created</i>
<i>by marketing people.</i>

11:37.988 --> 11:41.158
<i>It means an object or device,</i>
<i>featured in a cartoon,</i>

11:41.242 --> 11:43.911
<i>that could easily become</i>
<i>a mass-produced toy.</i>

11:43.994 --> 11:46.872
<i>Female characters trend</i>
<i>towards this version of femininity</i>,

11:46.956 --> 11:49.208
<i>because companies</i>
<i>are responding to what we buy.</i>

11:49.291 --> 11:50.710
<i>If Clio had to be a toy,</i>

11:50.793 --> 11:53.713
<i>there would be meeting after meeting</i>
<i>to get her just right.</i>

11:53.796 --> 11:56.173
<i>She would have to be pretty</i>
<i>and glamorous but relatable.</i>

11:56.257 --> 11:58.968
<i>Clumsy but not awkward. Smart</i>
<i>but not too smart. Funny but not silly.</i>

11:59.051 --> 12:01.053
<i>Girly but also sporty.</i>
<i>Aspirational but approachable.</i>

12:01.137 --> 12:02.805
<i>Flirty but not sexy.</i>

12:02.888 --> 12:06.308
<i>She would need to be everything…</i>
<i>to everyone.</i>

12:10.229 --> 12:12.398
<i>There are exceptions</i>
<i>to this way of doing business,</i>

12:12.481 --> 12:15.985
<i>and we happen to have the freedom</i>
<i>to simply design Clio as a character.</i>

12:16.694 --> 12:21.782
<i>So we decided to try something else.</i>
<i>What if we took Clio and made her CG?</i>

12:29.039 --> 12:31.542
<i>CG animation is highly specialized.</i>

12:31.625 --> 12:35.588
<i>From modeling to rigging to lighting,</i>
<i>each process has its own artist</i>

12:35.671 --> 12:38.340
<i>to help recreate</i>
<i>the illusion of life in 3D space.</i>

12:39.258 --> 12:42.386
<i>But the first problem</i>
<i>of turning Clio into CG is the very thing</i>

12:42.470 --> 12:44.930
<i>that made her distinctive, her silhouette.</i>

12:45.014 --> 12:49.602
Because normally, it's really hard
to find characters with these sharp edges,

12:50.352 --> 12:52.980
so I just decided to go for it
and see how it looks.

12:53.481 --> 12:56.984
<i>If we were animating Clio in 2D,</i>
<i>this wouldn't really be a problem.</i>

12:57.067 --> 12:59.320
<i>All we would do</i>
<i>is draw her slightly differently,</i>

12:59.403 --> 13:00.905
<i>depending on the angle.</i>

13:00.988 --> 13:02.948
<i>Take a look at Clio's chin here</i>

13:03.574 --> 13:04.575
<i>versus here.</i>

13:05.868 --> 13:09.455
<i>If we look at her hair on the left</i>
<i>versus the one on the right.</i>

13:10.664 --> 13:14.668
<i>These little inconsistencies help keep her</i>
<i>appealing from one drawing to another.</i>

13:15.211 --> 13:17.838
Well, I guess in 2D
you can animate anything.

13:17.922 --> 13:19.882
So in a few frames, you can just cheat it.

13:19.965 --> 13:23.469
That's the beautiful thing of 2D.
You can do whatever you want.

13:23.552 --> 13:27.723
There's a fluidity that you can get
to traditional animation

13:27.807 --> 13:32.728
and a… and a spontaneity
in the pencil work

13:32.812 --> 13:35.439
that you're not gonna get in CG.

13:35.523 --> 13:38.192
You can still create that illusion,

13:38.275 --> 13:39.902
but it's just harder to get to

13:39.985 --> 13:43.405
because you have to break
perfection to get that.

13:43.489 --> 13:46.909
And that's the tricky part.
I, as a character designer, need to know

13:46.992 --> 13:51.080
that this character
needs to look correct in all angles.

13:51.163 --> 13:53.165
<i>One of the difficult parts</i>
<i>of modeling Clio</i>

13:53.249 --> 13:55.292
<i>will be preserving</i>
<i>the straight and edgy elements.</i>

13:55.960 --> 14:00.172
<i>So if we have a sharp bend in the hip,</i>
<i>it might look good in 2D from this angle,</i>

14:00.256 --> 14:03.384
<i>but turn it into 3D,</i>
<i>and it might not look right.</i>

14:03.968 --> 14:06.595
<i>The computer wants to make</i>
<i>things mathematically perfect.</i>

14:06.679 --> 14:07.847
<i>So we have to go in there</i>

14:07.930 --> 14:10.808
<i>and push the computer to make</i>
<i>something that feels more natural,</i>

14:10.891 --> 14:13.477
<i>while maintaining</i>
<i>the feeling of the original drawing.</i>

14:14.061 --> 14:15.938
If you're dealing
with computer animation,

14:16.021 --> 14:20.776
you are dealing with the actual form,
and it matters, the edges of the form.

14:21.485 --> 14:23.988
There's an organic edge
that's an appealing design

14:24.071 --> 14:25.364
that's gotta be there.

14:25.447 --> 14:28.826
Like, right now, it's
a little bit too high, so, like, the--

14:28.909 --> 14:29.869
You want it lower?

14:29.952 --> 14:32.413
Yeah, so, like, it flows this way into it.

14:32.496 --> 14:34.373
I can do a draw-over, so…

14:34.456 --> 14:39.712
And I realized you can't just tell
people in CG, "Make it more appealing."

14:39.795 --> 14:42.006
No, you've gotta be very specific,

14:42.089 --> 14:46.635
like the corners of a mouth
just drove me crazy when I looked at CG.

14:46.719 --> 14:49.013
I found myself looking in the mirror

14:49.096 --> 14:51.515
and seeing the way
the corner of my mouth curves,

14:51.599 --> 14:55.144
and I discovered that Leyendecker
had already been doing that.

14:55.227 --> 14:57.938
And corners of the mouth
were the darkest parts,

14:58.022 --> 15:00.065
because you could see
the teeth setting in there,

15:00.149 --> 15:04.028
and there was, like, a little curve
that was in the corners of the mouth.

15:04.111 --> 15:07.740
And when I was designing,
uh, like Rapunzel for <i>Tangled,</i>

15:07.823 --> 15:11.994
I started designing those kinds
of little things in there, and…

15:14.079 --> 15:18.375
Design is design. You just have to know
which medium you're working in.

15:19.293 --> 15:21.253
<i>With everyone</i>
<i>having specialized jobs,</i>

15:21.337 --> 15:23.422
<i>it's very easy to cut yourself off.</i>

15:23.505 --> 15:27.176
<i>Somebody who does rigging might never talk</i>
<i>to someone who does lighting.</i>

15:27.259 --> 15:30.930
<i>And because of all of this,</i>
<i>collaboration is even more important.</i>

15:31.013 --> 15:34.433
There's a growth that happens
with collaboration.

15:34.516 --> 15:38.979
The energy, the back-and-forth,
the… the ping-pong, you know,

15:39.063 --> 15:42.191
"What about this?" "No, what about that?"
"What about this?" "Yeah, and then…"

15:42.274 --> 15:44.401
"That's a stupid idea, but--" "Oh, okay."

15:44.485 --> 15:47.112
-Always in the middle of that.
-Of course.

15:47.196 --> 15:50.366
It's just, it's invigorating,
and it's inspiring.

15:50.449 --> 15:53.243
-You don't wanna…
-We'll start to lose the shape and…

15:53.327 --> 15:54.703
I am a director,

15:55.621 --> 15:57.373
but I'm not the auteur.

15:57.456 --> 15:59.291
She starts off
in this conference room…

15:59.375 --> 16:02.878
No director
is the absolute end-all,

16:02.962 --> 16:04.546
be-all of everything of a film.

16:04.630 --> 16:07.508
And that was a shape,
and at least the framing…

16:07.591 --> 16:09.593


16:17.101 --> 16:19.520
Animators really like
to cheat things to camera.

16:20.020 --> 16:22.356
So we don't…
We don't like to animate

16:22.439 --> 16:24.858
how it should look in, like, 360 space

16:25.567 --> 16:29.863
because flesh squishes
and geometry doesn't.

16:29.947 --> 16:32.408
<i>Animating in CG</i>
<i>is all about understanding</i>

16:32.491 --> 16:33.993
<i>how computers interpret 3D space.</i>

16:34.076 --> 16:37.329
<i>Sometimes the computer comes up</i>
<i>with very strange ideas,</i>

16:37.413 --> 16:39.498
<i>which can only be solved by yelling at it.</i>

16:39.581 --> 16:41.333
-What?
-I think it's broken!

16:41.417 --> 16:42.376
What's that?

16:42.459 --> 16:43.669
I don't know.

16:43.752 --> 16:45.921
<i>The end goal</i>
<i>of character design today</i>

16:46.005 --> 16:49.633
<i>is the same as it was a hundred years ago,</i>
<i>to hand it off to an animator.</i>

16:50.134 --> 16:52.845
<i>And this is where another aspect</i>
<i>of appeal comes in.</i>

16:52.928 --> 16:55.305
<i>When the still image starts to move.</i>

16:56.098 --> 17:01.353
One of the things I think
a truly good CG animator has to have

17:01.437 --> 17:05.983
is the ability to think imperfectly.

17:06.066 --> 17:10.404
In traditional animation,
it's all about imperfections.

17:10.487 --> 17:14.742
If you want a certain expression,
you can elongate the eyeball,

17:14.825 --> 17:16.952
you can make the mouth go weird,

17:17.036 --> 17:19.413
you can, you know,
make the face to weird things

17:19.496 --> 17:23.250
or the hands go "bloop"
further than they need to pop things.

17:23.333 --> 17:27.337
And the human eye won't see it as that,
but they'll feel it.

17:27.421 --> 17:28.922
<i>Animators are imitating life,</i>

17:29.006 --> 17:33.260
<i>and the job is to make these characters</i>
<i>move and behave in a believable fashion.</i>

17:33.343 --> 17:35.971
<i>The limits come from how much time</i>
<i>and money we have</i>

17:36.055 --> 17:38.098
<i>and how far everyone is willing to push.</i>

17:38.182 --> 17:40.184
And I pushed really hard
with Merida.

17:40.267 --> 17:41.435
Oh, Mom.

17:42.144 --> 17:45.272
I was, like,
I want her face to get…

17:45.355 --> 17:48.108
…scrunched and pissed off, you know?

17:48.192 --> 17:51.653
And I want her to be able
to really express herself.

17:53.614 --> 17:56.742
Appeal is something
that's actually speaking to you.

17:56.825 --> 17:58.744
It's not just in the design. It's,

17:58.827 --> 18:01.872
"Do I connect?
Do I relate to this moment?"

18:01.955 --> 18:04.416
-Will you come down to dinner?
-No.

18:04.500 --> 18:08.337
Don't animate what the character's doing.
Animate what the character is thinking,

18:08.420 --> 18:10.130
what the character is feeling.

18:10.214 --> 18:13.050
Crawl into their skin.
Live in their skin and…

18:13.842 --> 18:15.886
That's what the people
are gonna connect with.

18:15.969 --> 18:18.013
That's where the appeal
is going to come from.

18:18.097 --> 18:21.141
I mean, it's why Belle yells at the Beast

18:21.225 --> 18:23.560
when he yells at her.
It's like, "Oh, I'm not taking that."

18:23.644 --> 18:24.645
That hurts!

18:24.728 --> 18:26.772
If you'd hold still,
it wouldn't hurt as much!

18:26.855 --> 18:29.191
'Cause I had a…
It's like, I have a temper.

18:29.274 --> 18:31.777
If someone does something to me,
I'll react!

18:32.277 --> 18:34.571
And… and I think, you know,

18:34.655 --> 18:36.490
kids… people found that relatable.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.535
<i>Appeal isn't just about</i>
<i>what a character looks like</i>

18:39.618 --> 18:41.370
<i>but how they make us feel.</i>

18:41.453 --> 18:44.915
<i>And when we talk about appeal,</i>
<i>we are also talking about taste,</i>

18:44.998 --> 18:47.876
<i>which is subjective and hard to quantify.</i>

18:49.795 --> 18:52.965
<i>Regardless, the end goal</i>
<i>of this entire process</i>

18:53.048 --> 18:54.591
<i>is to make a character</i>

18:54.675 --> 18:56.176
<i>that we hope you connect with.</i>

18:58.554 --> 19:04.810
I wish people knew
how much we put into our work.

19:04.893 --> 19:10.149
How much what we do is based on discovery.

19:11.483 --> 19:18.323
If you are animating a character,
you've invested yourself in them.

19:21.952 --> 19:25.873
When I was a kid, I had a terrible temper.

19:26.874 --> 19:28.959
You know, and when you got
a bad temper like that,

19:29.042 --> 19:31.753
you know that that's not the way
you really wanna be.

19:31.837 --> 19:38.051
But you feel like you're kinda…
trapped inside this beastie body there.

19:38.552 --> 19:43.765
When it came time to animate the Beast,
I knew what that was like.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.519
A prince is trapped in there.

19:48.687 --> 19:52.441
And you can see it in his eyes.

20:06.663 --> 20:11.835
I wish people knew
how much we put into what we animate,

20:11.919 --> 20:15.881
that they're really getting a glimpse
into the animator themselves.
