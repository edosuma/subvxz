WEBVTT

00:04.011 --> 00:06.247
Ok. And...

00:06.781 --> 00:08.248
We're set.

00:08.283 --> 00:10.050
I forgot to do my
wizard presentation,

00:10.084 --> 00:11.618
So I'm making one up on the spot.

00:11.753 --> 00:13.287
What is your topic going to be?

00:13.388 --> 00:16.657
Wizards versus mortals:
Who is stretchier?

00:20.662 --> 00:22.963
Well, this can't be good.

00:22.997 --> 00:24.798
Hey, justin, what is that thing?

00:24.832 --> 00:26.500
It's a wizard stretcher.

00:26.534 --> 00:28.068
Cool. What does it do?

00:31.472 --> 00:33.073
It tickles people.

00:34.208 --> 00:36.543
Oh, that makes sense.

00:39.113 --> 00:42.349
Alex, justin doesn't seem to
think this is a good idea,

00:42.383 --> 00:44.885
And he's usually better at
seeing danger than you are.

00:44.919 --> 00:46.386
Come on, harper.

00:46.421 --> 00:49.323
Justin thinks singing in
the shower is dangerous.

00:49.357 --> 00:51.224
That's because singing
leads to dancing.

00:51.259 --> 00:54.161
And dancing leads to slipping.

00:54.195 --> 00:57.631
Ok, everybody. It's time for
alex's big wizard presentation.

00:57.665 --> 00:59.666
And we are not doing this.

01:01.069 --> 01:02.202
Get harper out of there.

01:02.236 --> 01:03.437
But...

01:03.471 --> 01:04.938
Fine.

01:09.644 --> 01:11.345
Stop it. Oh, please, it tickles.

01:11.379 --> 01:13.814
Please, alex, no.

01:13.848 --> 01:16.950
Wait. No, it doesn't.

01:16.984 --> 01:21.154
I didn't mean to do that, but it's so
much funnier than what I meant to do.

01:21.189 --> 01:23.924
- Alex, this is not a joke.
- Well, harper's laughing.

01:23.958 --> 01:26.360
You know I use laughter
to hide the pain.

01:34.535 --> 01:37.504
You can't get away with
treating people like this, alex.

01:37.538 --> 01:39.306
Sometimes you're just
not a nice person.

01:39.340 --> 01:41.908
I'm a nice person.

01:43.077 --> 01:44.478
Well, nice enough.

01:51.586 --> 01:53.820
Hey, hugh. I didn't
know you were coming by.

01:53.855 --> 01:55.188
Hey, mister russo.

01:55.390 --> 01:57.624
I was taking a stroll
through the portals.

01:57.658 --> 01:59.226
Thought I'd drop in.

01:59.260 --> 02:02.696
Ok, well, have fun.

02:02.730 --> 02:05.499
I'll go console harper
until she stops laughing.

02:07.435 --> 02:08.869
Hey, hugh. What's up?

02:08.902 --> 02:11.071
I'll tell you what's up.

02:11.105 --> 02:12.773
A cherry lollipop?

02:12.807 --> 02:14.808
It's a hobo bindle.

02:14.842 --> 02:17.244
I ran away from home.

02:17.278 --> 02:18.945
That is a great idea.

02:19.080 --> 02:21.548
I'm totally gonna come here
when I run away from home.

02:21.582 --> 02:24.317
I just found out I'm
not actually a giant.

02:24.352 --> 02:25.952
Oh. Really?

02:25.987 --> 02:28.355
I just found out people
think I'm not very nice.

02:28.389 --> 02:32.292
- And I'm adopted.
- Ok, you win.

02:33.861 --> 02:35.695
* well, you know everything's
gonna be a breeze *

02:36.264 --> 02:37.597
* that the end will no
doubt justify the means *

02:38.232 --> 02:39.800
* you can fix any problem
with the slightest of ease *

02:39.834 --> 02:41.435
* yes, please *

02:41.469 --> 02:43.270
* but you might find out
it'll go to your head *

02:43.871 --> 02:45.071
* when you write a report
on a book you never read *

02:45.807 --> 02:47.407
* with the snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *

02:47.442 --> 02:49.242
* that's what I said *

02:49.277 --> 02:52.579
* everything is not what it seems *

02:52.613 --> 02:56.216
* you can get all you wanted
in your wildest dreams *

02:56.250 --> 02:59.786
* you might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *

02:59.821 --> 03:04.658
* because everything
is not what it seems *

03:04.692 --> 03:07.794
* everything is not what it seems *

03:07.829 --> 03:11.598
* when you can have what you
want by the simplest of means *

03:11.632 --> 03:15.435
* be careful not to mess
with the balance of things *

03:15.470 --> 03:19.306
* because everything is not *

03:19.340 --> 03:21.875
* what it seems *

03:21.876 --> 03:28.876

03:28.883 --> 03:32.319
I can't believe your parents waited
to tell you you were adopted.

03:32.353 --> 03:34.154
Oh, I always knew.

03:34.188 --> 03:36.857
I just assumed my birth
parents were giants, too.

03:36.891 --> 03:38.425
And it turns out they're not.

03:38.459 --> 03:40.560
I've been living a giant lie.

03:44.732 --> 03:47.067
I like what you did there
with the giant and the lie.

03:47.101 --> 03:48.468
I shouldn't be joking.

03:49.971 --> 03:52.372
Listen, hugh,
I think you should go home.

03:52.406 --> 03:54.174
From the size of your hobo bindle,

03:54.208 --> 03:57.043
You only got enough
food for a bite.

03:57.078 --> 04:00.046
No. I'm not going home.

04:00.081 --> 04:02.315
I've been acting like
a giant my entire life

04:02.350 --> 04:04.718
When in reality I'm just
a regular-sized boy.

04:04.752 --> 04:07.554
I'd put you on the
wizard stretcher,

04:07.588 --> 04:10.857
But the tickling part is broken.

04:10.892 --> 04:15.562
Guys, I think we need to be more
sensitive to hugh's feelings right now.

04:17.197 --> 04:18.832
What?

04:18.866 --> 04:21.434
I can be sensitive to
a person's feelings.

04:22.904 --> 04:25.772
Unlike you people. Staring is rude.

04:27.475 --> 04:29.609
If you want to be a nicer person,

04:30.044 --> 04:32.846
It might be easier to start with smaller
things until you get the hang of it.

04:32.880 --> 04:35.181
You know, like lying about
how nice my haircuts are,

04:35.216 --> 04:38.718
Or not putting hamster
food in max's oatmeal.

04:41.889 --> 04:43.657
Look, I can handle this.

04:43.691 --> 04:46.359
I'll convince hugh to go back
home and talk to his parents

04:46.394 --> 04:48.194
And get everything
straightened out.

04:48.362 --> 04:52.365
Really? That actually
sounds like a helpful plan.

04:52.400 --> 04:55.635
Let's get out of here before
helpful turns into hurtful.

04:57.872 --> 05:00.707
Alex, I'm not going home.

05:00.741 --> 05:04.578
I don't feel comfortable talking
about this with my parents.

05:04.612 --> 05:07.714
They don't understand what
it's like not to be a giant.

05:07.748 --> 05:11.585
Well, guess I have to
support your decision.

05:11.619 --> 05:14.421
Lucky for you, today is the day
I've decided to help others.

05:14.455 --> 05:16.556
That doesn't really sound like you.

05:16.591 --> 05:18.091
Then if you still want to leave,

05:18.693 --> 05:20.794
I can sneak you upstairs and
you can hide in my bedroom.

05:20.828 --> 05:22.495
That sounds more like you.

05:22.530 --> 05:24.898
Yeah. It'll be more fun. Let's go.

05:29.437 --> 05:31.004
Uh oh, maxy.

05:31.038 --> 05:33.340
Looks like you're making
your thinking face again.

05:33.374 --> 05:35.308
That's right.

05:36.544 --> 05:39.879
Mom, I'm sick of alex
treating me with no respect.

05:41.015 --> 05:42.716
I'm thinking of a way
to get back at her.

05:42.817 --> 05:44.517
Oh, do you mean like
a practical joke?

05:44.552 --> 05:47.988
Actually, I've been
calling it revenge.

05:48.022 --> 05:50.857
Let's just call it a
practical joke, ok?

05:50.891 --> 05:53.159
It's less of a red flag.

05:53.194 --> 05:57.397
I'm a bit of a
practical joker myself.

05:57.431 --> 05:59.132
- Really?
- Yeah.

05:59.300 --> 06:01.601
I've played a lot of jokes on
your father over the years.

06:01.636 --> 06:03.570
- Like what?
- Well, like...

06:03.604 --> 06:07.207
Wadding up his clothes
so they get all wrinkled.

06:08.976 --> 06:14.147
Putting a sign on his back that
says something hilarious like:

06:14.181 --> 06:16.082
"my knees hurt in the morning."

06:17.885 --> 06:19.252
Or, or...

06:19.286 --> 06:21.388
"I could use a good shower."

06:24.625 --> 06:28.161
Those are the worst practical
jokes I've ever heard.

06:28.195 --> 06:30.463
What? Maybe you just
don't understand them.

06:30.498 --> 06:31.598
The note says:

06:31.632 --> 06:33.566
"my knees hurt in the morning."

06:33.701 --> 06:38.405
That way when people read it
they think he's a stinky geezer.

06:40.941 --> 06:42.575
Don't you get it?

06:42.610 --> 06:44.377
You don't get it?

06:45.746 --> 06:47.147
All right. Here we are.

06:47.581 --> 06:49.315
We'll just wait here until
you start feeling better.

06:49.350 --> 06:51.851
Oh. Let me clean up.

06:51.886 --> 06:53.486
Ok. Sit.

06:55.322 --> 06:56.423
Are you feeling better now?

06:56.457 --> 06:57.724
- No.
- Ok.

07:02.663 --> 07:06.366
- What about now?
- No.

07:06.400 --> 07:10.904
Oh my gosh, this helping others
thing is taking way too long.

07:10.938 --> 07:12.439
Why don't we try talking?

07:12.473 --> 07:15.508
Ok. It's just that my whole life,

07:15.543 --> 07:17.811
I always thought I had
a giant's blood...

07:17.845 --> 07:21.347
All right. Talking is too
exhausting. Never mind.

07:21.382 --> 07:23.216
Why don't I just turn
you into a giant?

07:23.250 --> 07:24.584
Really? Could you do that?

07:24.952 --> 07:28.288
Well, technically,
I'm not supposed to,

07:28.322 --> 07:30.423
But my dad thinks
I should be nicer.

07:30.458 --> 07:34.160
So really I'd be going against
my father if I didn't do this.

07:34.195 --> 07:38.298
Very impressive job
of twisting the facts.

07:38.332 --> 07:41.201
Thank you. It's kind of what I do.

07:42.570 --> 07:45.705
Put on a show. Let's let hugh
know what it's like to grow.

07:50.010 --> 07:51.878
Um, alex?

07:51.912 --> 07:54.748
I think you made yourself
into a giant, too.

07:54.782 --> 07:58.284
No. I messed up. I just made
everything in my room smaller.

07:58.319 --> 08:00.487
Well, wait. That's not even.

08:00.521 --> 08:02.889
alex!

08:02.923 --> 08:04.991
That's my dad. I've got
to go see what he wants.

08:05.025 --> 08:06.626
Wait, what should I do?

08:06.727 --> 08:08.695
I don't know.
What do giants usually do?

08:08.729 --> 08:10.964
They usually talk about
how small everything is.

08:10.998 --> 08:12.465
Um... Ok, then.

08:12.500 --> 08:16.970
Start with this pillow.
I'll be right back.

08:17.004 --> 08:21.808
Oh, man. This pillow is small.

08:21.842 --> 08:24.811
That chair is so little.

08:24.845 --> 08:26.513
Ok. We get it.

08:26.547 --> 08:29.449
Everything in here is small.

08:29.483 --> 08:31.184
There you are, honey.

08:31.218 --> 08:33.153
This is doug and cathy normous.

08:35.389 --> 08:37.890
Hugh's parents?

08:37.924 --> 08:39.592
They say he ran away.

08:39.626 --> 08:41.094
Do you know anything about this?

08:41.361 --> 08:44.764
I saw him this morning in the lair.

08:44.799 --> 08:46.232
But then he left the lair.

08:46.534 --> 08:48.334
He's not here,
right? I don't know anything.

08:50.104 --> 08:52.238
I heard there were
giants in the house.

08:52.273 --> 08:53.640
Oh my gosh.

08:53.674 --> 08:55.708
Hello. Welcome, you guys.

08:55.743 --> 08:57.510
My name is justin russo.

08:57.812 --> 09:00.647
This is such an incredible honor.
I've read so many facts about giants.

09:00.681 --> 09:05.251
Like how you're so big they make
push brooms out of your nose hairs.

09:05.286 --> 09:08.421
Here we go again
with the stereotypes.

09:08.455 --> 09:09.722
That's not a fact.

09:09.757 --> 09:12.125
That's from a joke
book about giants.

09:12.159 --> 09:15.495
No, it isn't. My dad told me.

09:17.364 --> 09:20.300
He also told me your shoes are so
big they come with turn signals.

09:20.334 --> 09:21.868
And when you back up you go:

09:21.902 --> 09:24.337
Beep. Coming through. Giant. Beep.

09:27.274 --> 09:30.376
I might have heard a couple
of things down at the lodge.

09:30.411 --> 09:33.112
They may not be true.

09:33.147 --> 09:36.649
Alex, did hugh say
where he was going?

09:36.684 --> 09:38.985
We think he may have gone to
look for his birth parents.

09:39.019 --> 09:40.353
Which is ok with us.

09:40.554 --> 09:42.622
We always figured he'd
want to do that one day.

09:42.656 --> 09:46.226
Are you saying hugh's adopted?

09:46.260 --> 09:49.529
He's adopted. What?

09:49.563 --> 09:52.131
Please, if you hear
from him, call us.

09:52.166 --> 09:54.133
We certainly will, mr.
And mrs. Normous.

09:54.168 --> 09:55.935
We'll let you know
if anything turns up.

09:55.970 --> 09:58.938
Oh, doug. I hope hughy's ok.

09:58.973 --> 10:01.875
Don't worry, mrs. Normous.
I'm sure he'll show up.

10:01.909 --> 10:04.844
Oh, there.

10:04.879 --> 10:06.880
Well, you know what dad says:

10:06.914 --> 10:09.182
"giant tears,
break out the life raft."

10:09.216 --> 10:10.383
Shh.

10:10.484 --> 10:13.052
Ok. She's just joking.

10:14.288 --> 10:15.355
Ooh.

10:15.389 --> 10:16.956
Why don't you go wash that, honey?

10:16.991 --> 10:18.625
Go ahead.

10:26.433 --> 10:27.367
Oh.

10:27.401 --> 10:29.102
Hello, hugh.

10:29.136 --> 10:31.671
You don't mind if I play a
practical joke on alex, do you?

10:31.705 --> 10:33.573
You think you have a
better practical joke

10:33.607 --> 10:36.242
Than what already happened in here?

10:38.145 --> 10:41.247
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

10:42.516 --> 10:43.750
Check this out.

10:43.851 --> 10:45.885
Please tell me those
aren't grasshoppers.

10:45.920 --> 10:49.155
I have a terrible
fear of grasshoppers.

10:49.189 --> 10:51.591
- They're not grasshoppers.
- Oh, good.

10:51.625 --> 10:53.626
- They're crickets.
- Close enough.

10:57.631 --> 10:59.399
They're everywhere.

10:59.433 --> 11:01.267
Wow, hugh. Nice job.

11:01.302 --> 11:04.070
You broke everything
and made it look small.

11:06.507 --> 11:08.775
Yeah, we get it.

11:08.809 --> 11:11.544
It is a very small table.

11:11.578 --> 11:14.280
Bye bye, mr. And mrs. Normous.

11:14.315 --> 11:16.516
Come back anytime!

11:19.620 --> 11:22.021
What was that ruckus?

11:25.292 --> 11:26.926
What ruckus?

11:26.961 --> 11:28.661
From upstairs.

11:28.696 --> 11:31.264
I heard a ruckus.

11:31.298 --> 11:35.034
Can you describe
the ruckus, justin?

11:36.003 --> 11:39.072
Kind of like a max ruckus.

11:39.106 --> 11:41.407
You know, you may be right.

11:41.442 --> 11:43.643
I'm going to investigate.
By myself.

11:43.677 --> 11:47.747
It might be too dangerous for you.
You know how ruckuues can get.

11:47.781 --> 11:51.351
And now I have to go investigate.

11:56.690 --> 11:58.091
What are you smiling at?

11:58.125 --> 12:00.660
What's that on your back, jerry?

12:00.694 --> 12:04.764
Looks like somebody
taped a sign on there.

12:04.798 --> 12:08.735
Says, "I'm very lazy".

12:08.769 --> 12:10.570
Was that there the whole time?

12:12.973 --> 12:15.174
Now the giants think I'm lazy.

12:15.209 --> 12:17.377
Oh, honey.

12:19.046 --> 12:20.246
My room!

12:20.280 --> 12:21.848
Max, what did you do?

12:21.882 --> 12:24.217
You see how she just
assumes it was me?

12:28.288 --> 12:30.356
Hugh! Shrunken room!

12:30.391 --> 12:31.958
Alex, I knew you
were up to no good.

12:32.126 --> 12:34.193
You see how he just
assumes it was me?

12:37.901 --> 12:40.135
Alex, I think you need
to go tell mom and dad

12:40.170 --> 12:42.771
You've been harboring hugh
in your shrunken bedroom.

12:42.806 --> 12:46.241
And I think you need to consider
being a nicer person, like me.

12:46.276 --> 12:47.676
I mean that in the nicest way.

12:47.944 --> 12:50.412
Even your nice way sounds snarky.

12:51.014 --> 12:53.482
Um, alex...

12:53.516 --> 12:55.751
I appreciate what you're
trying to do for me,

12:55.785 --> 12:57.719
But the only thing
you've shown me is

12:57.754 --> 13:00.622
I can't be a giant without
ruining everything.

13:00.657 --> 13:03.926
At least before I thought I
was supposed to be a giant.

13:03.960 --> 13:05.427
I don't know who I am now.

13:05.461 --> 13:09.331
Helping people is so complicated.

13:09.365 --> 13:11.567
Rj  maybe we should
find your birth parents.

13:11.601 --> 13:12.968
That could make you feel better.

13:13.403 --> 13:16.738
Yeah. Maybe it would.
How would we find them?

13:16.773 --> 13:18.907
I'm sure justin will
come up with something.

13:18.942 --> 13:22.611
- I'm not getting involved.
- Ok. Fine. Come on, hugh.

13:22.645 --> 13:25.981
You can hide in justin's room. I'll
tell mom and dad he's hiding you there.

13:27.084 --> 13:29.318
- I got a couple ideas.
- I had a feeling you would.

13:30.253 --> 13:32.121
ah!

13:32.155 --> 13:34.724
All right, everybody follow justin.

13:34.758 --> 13:37.460
No. Except for you. You stay here.

13:37.494 --> 13:40.730
If my room isn't fixed,
I'm telling mom and dad what you did.

13:44.601 --> 13:46.635
At least give me a spell
to help clean it up.

13:46.670 --> 13:48.170
you're on your own, jerk face.

13:48.205 --> 13:49.805
Thank you.

13:52.242 --> 13:55.678
"you're on your own, jerk face."

13:55.712 --> 13:59.382
All we have to find is the ancient and
delicate book of wizard family trees.

13:59.416 --> 14:01.684
- Got it.
- Don't drop it.

14:06.990 --> 14:10.326
Wow. That thing's really sprouted
since I last looked at it.

14:10.360 --> 14:12.628
I've been watering it.
I put these cool wheels on it

14:12.662 --> 14:14.930
In case you need to
wheel it anywhere.

14:16.767 --> 14:19.001
Each leaf tells a different
person's history.

14:19.035 --> 14:20.269
Here's dad's.

14:20.470 --> 14:22.905
Russo family history.
Five generations.

14:22.939 --> 14:26.509
Current generation: Jerry russo,
son of duke and rose russo.

14:26.543 --> 14:27.510
hey.

14:27.544 --> 14:30.045
Shh.

14:30.080 --> 14:32.915
Hugh, what are you doing here?
Your parents are worried sick.

14:32.949 --> 14:35.918
We're taking your advice.
You told me to be a nicer person,

14:35.952 --> 14:38.087
So we're helping hugh
find his birth parents.

14:38.121 --> 14:40.489
You lied to us about
knowing where hugh was.

14:40.524 --> 14:42.658
And you lied to a pair of giants.

14:42.692 --> 14:46.262
The guys at the lodge
say giants eat liars.

14:46.296 --> 14:48.798
It's my fault, mr. Russo.

14:48.832 --> 14:51.700
Alex lied because this is
really important to me.

14:51.735 --> 14:53.736
I need to learn about
my birth parents.

14:53.770 --> 14:57.106
Well, you did tell alex
she needs to be nicer.

14:57.140 --> 14:59.408
Yeah, but I didn't
think she'd do it.

14:59.443 --> 15:01.577
All right, let's make this quick.

15:01.611 --> 15:03.279
Is that hugh's leaf?

15:03.313 --> 15:06.449
Jerry russo's great-great
grandfather, ignatius russo,

15:06.483 --> 15:08.551
Wrote the first joke
book about giants.

15:11.855 --> 15:14.056
I don't know anything about that.

15:15.692 --> 15:17.893
Here it is. My family leaf.

15:17.928 --> 15:19.195
Hugh normous.

15:19.396 --> 15:21.564
Adoptive parents:
Doug and cathy normous.

15:21.598 --> 15:24.500
Birth parents:
Lew and mary lou fineman.

15:24.534 --> 15:26.469
Lew and mary lou fineman.

15:26.503 --> 15:28.737
I wonder if you have
permission to contact them.

15:28.772 --> 15:30.940
- He does.
- Oh, that was easy. Ok.

15:30.974 --> 15:33.142
Justin, can I use your wand?

15:33.176 --> 15:35.911
I used up all my minutes
crank calling your wand.

15:35.946 --> 15:40.816
- So, you're miss higglebottom?
- Hello, justin.

15:40.851 --> 15:44.587
Make this all better.

15:44.621 --> 15:46.622
Um... Ok.

15:46.656 --> 15:48.324
Put things back.

15:51.962 --> 15:53.362
Roomius fixus.

15:57.434 --> 16:00.803
Wow, I can't believe that worked.

16:00.837 --> 16:03.706
Ok. Now I just have
to think of a way

16:03.740 --> 16:06.008
To put all this
stuff back together.

16:06.042 --> 16:08.043
Let's go thinking face.

16:09.145 --> 16:10.679
Alex?

16:10.714 --> 16:14.083
Whoa, what happened in here?

16:14.117 --> 16:17.887
- Harper, I need your help.
- With what?

16:17.921 --> 16:20.789
You were a part of alex's plan to put
me in that tickling machine earlier.

16:20.824 --> 16:25.294
- No, I wasn't.
- Well, you were there.

16:25.328 --> 16:28.197
What does that have
to do with anything?

16:28.231 --> 16:31.433
I'm going to mess up my room to
draw attention away from this room.

16:31.468 --> 16:35.037
All you need to do is help me
destroy everything that I own.

16:37.107 --> 16:40.276
That'll teach alex to mess with me.

16:40.310 --> 16:43.212
This is why I hardly
ever talk to you.

16:46.416 --> 16:48.851
There, my wand is protected
from crank callers,

16:48.885 --> 16:51.020
Because I added a password.

16:51.788 --> 16:53.489
Submarine.

16:57.894 --> 16:59.795
That's not it.

17:04.233 --> 17:08.436
Alex, do you think my birth parents are
going to like me when they get here?

17:08.471 --> 17:10.204
They're your family, hugh.

17:10.473 --> 17:13.041
They don't have to like you,
they just have to put up with you.

17:14.477 --> 17:16.244
Like right now, jerry.

17:17.847 --> 17:20.883
I mean, they'll have no
problem putting up with you.

17:22.719 --> 17:24.353
Alex, I need to talk to you.

17:26.056 --> 17:27.623
Max is going to destroy his room.

17:28.023 --> 17:29.758
He thinks it'll get him off
for destroying your room.

17:29.859 --> 17:32.294
- That doesn't make any sense.
- Thank you.

17:32.329 --> 17:34.930
You have to make sure
he goes through with it.

17:34.965 --> 17:36.999
What? But it's a ridiculous plan.

17:37.033 --> 17:39.034
What I've been learning, harper,

17:39.069 --> 17:42.204
Is that sometimes it's nice
to do things for others.

17:42.238 --> 17:45.474
So, could you do this
for me as a friend.

17:45.508 --> 17:47.176
As a very, very best friend.

17:47.210 --> 17:50.245
You russos are so manipulative.

17:55.418 --> 17:57.987
Hi, you must be the
finemans. Come in.

17:58.021 --> 18:01.490
Yes, that's right. Hi.
Lew and mary lou fineman.

18:01.524 --> 18:03.459
You must be alex.
Thanks for the phone call.

18:03.493 --> 18:04.760
Now where's that boy of ours?

18:04.794 --> 18:06.395
I'm right here.

18:07.530 --> 18:09.298
Oh!

18:09.332 --> 18:11.133
Look at you.

18:12.535 --> 18:15.337
You're just as handsome
as we remember you.

18:15.372 --> 18:17.906
Son, come here, ya big lout.

18:19.576 --> 18:23.245
Wow. Big. Look...

18:23.279 --> 18:25.681
I just wanted you to know
before we go any further,

18:25.715 --> 18:29.818
That we love you and
we always loved you.

18:29.853 --> 18:34.289
It was a difficult decision
giving you up for adoption, hugh.

18:34.324 --> 18:36.759
Not because there's
anything wrong with you.

18:36.793 --> 18:39.728
There's something wrong
with your father.

18:39.763 --> 18:43.065
It's called "
can't hold down a job."

18:43.099 --> 18:46.135
Making pottery is a job.

18:46.169 --> 18:49.705
As soon as you sell one it will be.

18:51.074 --> 18:55.310
Look at them putting
up with each other.

18:55.345 --> 18:56.845
It's ok.

18:56.880 --> 19:00.683
I was raised by some really nice
people who I love very much.

19:00.717 --> 19:04.753
I'm just glad to be able to meet
the people who gave birth to me.

19:04.788 --> 19:06.689
We're glad, too.

19:06.723 --> 19:09.858
But maybe we should go somewhere
else to talk about it.

19:09.893 --> 19:11.927
I think I heard a cricket
somewhere in this house

19:12.028 --> 19:14.396
Bnd I am terrified of those things.

19:14.431 --> 19:17.966
Hey. Me, too!
I must get that from you.

19:18.001 --> 19:20.302
I wonder what you got from me.

19:24.174 --> 19:30.212
Well, you didn't get your
size from us, that's for sure.

19:30.246 --> 19:34.016
Really? I don't normally
think of myself as big.

19:34.050 --> 19:37.586
Are you kidding?
You're like a human skyscraper.

19:37.620 --> 19:39.021
Don't you mean a giant?

19:39.055 --> 19:40.589
Exactly.

19:40.623 --> 19:44.093
I guess, in a way, I'm exactly
who I always thought I was.

19:44.127 --> 19:46.462
I'm a giant after all.

19:47.831 --> 19:51.133
I promised myself I wouldn't cry.

19:53.002 --> 19:55.037
When did you promise yourself that?

19:55.071 --> 19:56.739
You didn't know this
was going to happen.

19:56.840 --> 20:00.109
I'm not afraid of my emotions.

20:00.143 --> 20:02.077
Thanks, everyone,
for all your help.

20:02.112 --> 20:03.812
Especially you, alex.

20:03.847 --> 20:06.682
This is the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

20:06.716 --> 20:08.984
Thanks, hugh.

20:09.018 --> 20:11.954
And could you say that again
louder so my dad can hear?

20:13.723 --> 20:15.891
Are you ready, hugh?

20:15.925 --> 20:19.561
Yeah, but could we stop and get
my parents before we go to talk?

20:19.596 --> 20:22.097
Yes, we'd love to meet them.

20:22.132 --> 20:24.333
They should come over to our house.

20:24.367 --> 20:26.135
Maybe we should go out.

20:26.169 --> 20:30.205
A couch seats four of
us but only one of them.

20:30.240 --> 20:33.208
Bye, lew. Mary lou. Hugh.

20:34.611 --> 20:39.348
Alex, your mother and I are very
proud of the way you helped.

20:39.382 --> 20:41.283
Wait a minute. What is that?

20:41.317 --> 20:44.019
- What?
- That feeling in my stomach.

20:44.053 --> 20:46.655
It's kind of warm and pleasant.

20:48.024 --> 20:50.225
That's called compassion.

20:51.895 --> 20:55.063
It's what happens when you do
something nice for someone else.

20:56.966 --> 20:59.568
Wow. Well...

20:59.602 --> 21:02.471
I probably won't make a habit of it,
but it's not too bad.

21:04.000 --> 21:10.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

21:11.002 --> 21:13.570
Hey, I can't believe this,

21:13.604 --> 21:16.106
But somebody destroyed my room.

21:17.975 --> 21:19.576
What are you talking about?

21:19.610 --> 21:21.244
Everything I own.

21:21.279 --> 21:23.780
- Completely ruined.
- What?

21:27.318 --> 21:30.153
Well, now that my
room is destroyed,

21:30.188 --> 21:34.257
Mom and dad will never believe
I destroyed your room, too.

21:34.292 --> 21:36.259
Guess I showed you, alex.

21:38.196 --> 21:42.632
Max, you are lobbing this one
so high up for her right now.

21:42.667 --> 21:46.570
Oh yeah? Take a look at
this whole box of lob.

21:47.972 --> 21:50.540
- Your clock radio is broken?
- Yep.

21:50.575 --> 21:53.009
- Your lava lamp is lava-less?
- Mm-hm.

21:53.044 --> 21:56.379
And your ceramic hamburger
has a gnarly bite out of it?

21:56.414 --> 21:58.181
You got that right.

21:59.684 --> 22:03.119
Wow, max. You sure got me by
wrecking all of your own stuff.

22:03.154 --> 22:05.589
That's right I got you. Wait...

22:07.625 --> 22:09.926
Oh, man. I think I got me.

22:11.629 --> 22:13.396
Dude, this is mine.

22:13.431 --> 22:14.598
So you got her too.

22:14.732 --> 22:17.267
Sucker. High five, brother.
