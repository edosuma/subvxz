Son, I'm afraid this will hurt
me more than it hurts you.

00:48.190 --> 00:49.040
Yeah I know.

00:49.090 --> 00:51.800
I shouldn't have done what
I done did.

00:52.660 --> 00:53.900
What did I done do?

00:53.970 --> 00:55.910
You were about to do something.

00:55.970 --> 00:57.470
I wrote Minority Report.

00:57.540 --> 00:59.850
Thank goodness you caught
me in time.

00:59.910 --> 01:01.010
You're telling me.

01:01.070 --> 01:02.710
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hang on now.

01:03.180 --> 01:04.709
Put on your protective goggles.

01:04.780 --> 01:05.620
Good thinking.

01:05.680 --> 01:08.560
We wouldn't want one of us to
get hurt here, would we?

01:09.080 --> 01:10.190
Ah, there.

01:10.250 --> 01:14.490
Now, I do not ever want to catch
you about to think about doing

01:14.550 --> 01:17.330
the thing that you were about to
think about doing.

01:17.390 --> 01:18.700
Ever again!

01:18.760 --> 01:20.430
Is that clear?

01:20.490 --> 01:23.200
Shake, I'm very sorry that
I thought about doing

01:23.260 --> 01:25.770
what you said I was about to do
but didn't.

01:25.830 --> 01:27.500
And I'm sorry too.

01:27.570 --> 01:28.410
Who said that?

01:28.470 --> 01:30.170
- You said it.
- But I heard you say it.

01:30.240 --> 01:31.910
- We both said it.
- You got my tooth.

01:31.970 --> 01:33.750
How am I gonna chew
newspaper now?

01:33.810 --> 01:35.050
Well, we can eat yogurt.

01:35.110 --> 01:36.480
Ahhh, I like me some yogurt.

01:36.540 --> 01:37.880
I like me some yogurt too.

01:37.940 --> 01:38.980
'Cause yogurt got flavors.

01:39.040 --> 01:40.890
Newspapers just got
the one flavor.

01:40.950 --> 01:42.620
We should have always been
eating yogurt.

01:42.680 --> 01:43.850
- Shouldn't we?
- Yeah,

01:43.920 --> 01:45.290
but newspaper is free.

01:45.350 --> 01:46.950
MEATWAD #1
In the trash can.

01:47.020 --> 01:48.050
Here, you take my tooth.

01:48.120 --> 01:49.100
No, you keep it.

01:49.150 --> 01:50.000
You keep it.

01:50.060 --> 01:51.660
I'll tell you what,
we'll share the tooth.

01:52.120 --> 01:54.300
Look, it fits.
It fits.

01:54.360 --> 01:56.570
Hey Shake,
I got me a new best friend.

01:56.630 --> 01:58.300
Noooo, the horror.

01:58.360 --> 01:59.210
What's your name boy?

01:59.260 --> 02:00.110
Meatwad.

02:00.170 --> 02:01.970
Of the New Jersey Meatwads?

02:02.070 --> 02:03.010
After you.

02:03.070 --> 02:04.140
No please, after you.

02:04.200 --> 02:05.150
- You go ahead.
- Shut up.

02:05.200 --> 02:06.340
I couldn't possibly.

02:06.410 --> 02:08.889
- After you.
- No, no, no, no, I insist.

02:08.940 --> 02:10.210
- After you.
- Shut up, both of you.

02:10.280 --> 02:12.190
No please, your hands are full
you go ahead.

02:12.240 --> 02:13.090
I ain't got hands.

02:13.150 --> 02:14.890
But I just rather that you go first.

02:14.950 --> 02:16.430
Why don't you just go ahead
anyway.

02:16.480 --> 02:17.460
No, no, I couldn't.

02:17.520 --> 02:18.890
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

02:22.550 --> 02:23.400
You lead the way.

02:23.460 --> 02:24.900
No, you lead the way.

02:25.260 --> 02:27.070
How's I suppose to know that he
was gonna do that?

02:27.130 --> 02:29.300
He's like a damn worm man,
he's got no brain.

02:29.360 --> 02:30.770
You cut him up and he'll
multiply.

02:30.830 --> 02:31.860
Wait a minute.

02:31.930 --> 02:33.570
You mean like in Tremors?

02:33.630 --> 02:34.470
Yes sure.

02:34.530 --> 02:35.840
Exactly, like Tremors.

02:35.900 --> 02:37.540
Get off the ground,
he feels the vibrations.

02:37.600 --> 02:39.640
You can float, go get me food!

02:40.340 --> 02:41.780
Let me follow you.

02:41.840 --> 02:43.340
No, I'll follow you.

02:43.410 --> 02:45.250
I would rather you lead the way.

02:45.310 --> 02:46.950
We could try to go in together.

02:47.010 --> 02:47.850
Hand in hand.

02:47.910 --> 02:49.620
That sounds like a good idea.

02:51.550 --> 02:52.650
We don't fit.

02:52.720 --> 02:54.930
We can do it hand
in hand side ways...

02:54.990 --> 02:57.590
But that would mean one of us
would have to go first.

02:57.660 --> 02:59.360
And I wouldn't be comfortable
with that.

02:59.420 --> 03:01.370
No, me neither.

03:01.430 --> 03:03.200
I would be comfortable with you
going first.

03:03.260 --> 03:04.210
Why don't you go first.

03:04.260 --> 03:06.040
No, only after you.

03:06.100 --> 03:08.140
But it wouldn't be right,
because you're more important.

03:08.200 --> 03:09.180
Listen to you.

03:09.230 --> 03:10.270
You're more important.

03:10.340 --> 03:12.040
I'm not more important than you.

03:12.100 --> 03:14.410
You're more important than me.

03:14.470 --> 03:17.610
That's sweet of you to say,
but you're the more important one.

03:17.680 --> 03:18.920
You're the most important.

03:18.980 --> 03:21.080
Well you're most-est important
than me.

03:21.150 --> 03:22.960
Okay, how about this,
why don't you two flip a coin.

03:23.010 --> 03:24.460
Whoever wins can hold the door.

03:24.520 --> 03:26.620
Well go ahead,
call it in the air.

03:26.690 --> 03:28.220
I'd rather you call it in the air.

03:28.290 --> 03:29.790
I don't want to call it in the air,

03:29.860 --> 03:31.390
that's too much responsibility.

03:31.460 --> 03:33.030
Well I don't want to call it in
the air.

03:33.090 --> 03:35.970
But if we call it in the air, then that
means someone would win.

03:36.030 --> 03:37.170
And I want you to win.

03:37.230 --> 03:38.300
But I want you to win.

03:38.360 --> 03:41.000
Get the fuck in here, you're
wasting all the heat.

03:41.070 --> 03:42.770
You don't even have a coin
idiots!

03:42.830 --> 03:46.080
Okay, how about this?
Why don't you hold the door for him.

03:46.140 --> 03:47.280
But the door's already open.

03:47.340 --> 03:48.250
And it's inside.

03:48.310 --> 03:49.580
Well I'll hold it open for you.

03:49.640 --> 03:50.810
No please, allow me.

03:50.880 --> 03:52.050
We'll hold it together.

03:52.380 --> 03:54.290
- Together!
- Together.

03:55.010 --> 03:57.550
Let's say it,
let's say together, together.

03:58.150 --> 03:59.250
On- on three.

03:59.320 --> 04:01.300
One, two, three.

04:01.590 --> 04:02.620
- Together.
- Together.

04:03.520 --> 04:05.260
We missed again.
Let's do it again.

04:05.320 --> 04:06.930
One, two, three.

04:06.990 --> 04:08.700
- Together.
- Together.

04:08.760 --> 04:10.260
Let's try it one more time.

04:10.330 --> 04:11.530
Just shut the damn door.

04:11.600 --> 04:13.170
I will shut it.

04:13.230 --> 04:15.640
And seal this embarassement from
my public.

04:15.700 --> 04:17.440
We've been tricked into entering
the door.

04:17.500 --> 04:19.350
I'm sorry I dragged you into
this mess.

04:19.399 --> 04:20.750
No, I'm the sorry one.

04:20.810 --> 04:22.750
No, no, no.
I'm the sorry one.

04:22.810 --> 04:24.410
Don't beat yourself
up over this.

04:24.480 --> 04:25.320
I'm the sorry one.

04:25.380 --> 04:27.250
You're both about to be very sorry,

04:27.310 --> 04:29.220
that you entered this horrid
world.

04:30.480 --> 04:32.220
Now that's called taking care of
business.

04:32.280 --> 04:34.160
Momma, daddy.

04:34.220 --> 04:36.100
Hey good buddy,
nice to meet you.

04:36.150 --> 04:37.720
- I'm Meatwad.
- So am I.

04:37.790 --> 04:38.960
I am too.

04:39.020 --> 04:40.000
Gotta be kidding me.

04:40.060 --> 04:41.370
We're all Meatwad.

04:41.430 --> 04:43.300
Let's have a tearful reunion.

04:43.360 --> 04:44.970
Group hug everybody.

04:46.030 --> 04:47.670
Hey, I got an idea.

04:47.730 --> 04:49.370
You want to play Candy Land?

04:49.430 --> 04:51.440
You took the words right out of
my brain.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.850
Let's play Candy Land.

04:52.900 --> 04:54.940
- Candy Land!
- Yeah Candy Land!

04:55.010 --> 04:56.040
How 'bout you Shake?

04:56.110 --> 04:57.550
Would you like to play
Candy Land?

04:57.610 --> 04:58.820
No I would not.

04:58.880 --> 05:01.260
But I will show you what I do
want to play.

05:02.050 --> 05:05.360
I declare these Olympic games
open.

05:06.280 --> 05:09.230
I see you, and I raise you 10.

05:09.290 --> 05:10.960
Oh my god they've octaculated.

05:11.020 --> 05:13.530
Look Frylock, Carl's showing us
how to play Texas Hold 'Em.

05:13.590 --> 05:14.940
Like they really do in a AC.

05:14.990 --> 05:15.900
He's real good at it.

05:15.960 --> 05:17.300
That's not how you play that.

05:17.360 --> 05:18.270
Those are flash cards.

05:18.330 --> 05:20.070
Uh, no, no, no, no,
they're wild cards.

05:20.130 --> 05:21.700
Th-They,
this is a different game.

05:21.770 --> 05:23.910
This is... we play this AC-B
style.

05:23.970 --> 05:25.810
Alright we've got a 5 dollar blind,

05:25.870 --> 05:27.040
10 dollar ante,

05:27.110 --> 05:28.780
Jacks to open, Trips to win.

05:28.840 --> 05:30.840
Who's in?
Let me see your money gentlemen.

05:30.910 --> 05:31.850
- I'm in.
- I'm in.

05:31.910 --> 05:32.750
I'm in.

05:32.810 --> 05:33.980
- I'm in.
- I'm in.

05:34.050 --> 05:35.080
- I'm in.
- I'm in.

05:35.150 --> 05:37.250
And I am in as well.

05:37.320 --> 05:39.760
And I will raise you
another 5 dollars.

05:39.820 --> 05:41.020
- I'm out.
- I'm out.

05:41.090 --> 05:42.430
- I'm out.
- Too rich for my blood.

05:42.490 --> 05:43.490
And I ain't got no damn money.

05:43.560 --> 05:44.400
Hey, Seven,

05:44.460 --> 05:47.230
when you ain't got no damn money
that's when you leave the table.

05:47.290 --> 05:48.130
But I like to watch.

05:48.190 --> 05:50.540
You lucky I ain't bring no pit
boss over here.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.370
That stuff wouldn't fly at the Taj.

05:52.430 --> 05:53.470
Alright Carl.

05:53.530 --> 05:54.640
Check it out.

05:54.700 --> 05:55.730
Triangle,

05:55.800 --> 05:56.680
Bug,

05:56.740 --> 05:57.940
Fire Truck.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.910
- Two pair.
- Yeah. You like that?

05:59.970 --> 06:02.180
- Not bad with only 3 cards.
- I ate 2 of them.

06:02.240 --> 06:04.740
But, uh, that certainly don't beat

06:04.810 --> 06:06.880
2 Goats, a Circle, a Star,

06:06.950 --> 06:08.450
and a letter J.

06:08.510 --> 06:10.250
Full House and a pair.

06:11.850 --> 06:13.420
Read 'em and weep gentlemen.

06:13.490 --> 06:14.660
I'm gonna cash out now.

06:14.720 --> 06:15.630
That's it Carl.

06:15.690 --> 06:18.170
Thanks for teaching us how to
play Texas Hold 'Em poker.

06:18.220 --> 06:20.730
These bills feel uh...
small,

06:20.790 --> 06:21.900
and yellow.

06:21.960 --> 06:23.800
And this is a dead squirrel.

06:23.860 --> 06:25.270
Maybe them bills shrunk.

06:25.330 --> 06:27.500
But probably they just come from
a board game.

06:27.570 --> 06:29.050
- Foreclosure.
- What the...

06:29.100 --> 06:31.080
I knew a chicken was never
President!

06:31.140 --> 06:32.810
You owe me $1,200.

06:32.870 --> 06:35.280
Or I'm gonna send my cousin over
here to break your hands.

06:35.340 --> 06:37.250
You've got 48 hours.

06:37.540 --> 06:38.610
Bye Carl!

06:38.680 --> 06:39.620
Thanks for the lesson.

06:39.680 --> 06:41.920
Pick your nose clean while you
got the chance.

06:41.980 --> 06:45.450
'Cause you'll be digging for gold with
finger splints after Tuesday.

06:48.220 --> 06:50.060
Nice to meet you, I'm Meatwad.

06:50.120 --> 06:51.100
So am I.

06:51.160 --> 06:52.430
Frylock, you gotta stop them.

06:52.490 --> 06:54.230
Just chill out,
they ain't bothering you.

06:54.290 --> 06:56.500
They keep multiplying.

06:56.560 --> 06:59.200
That's cause you keep chopping
them up into bits, Shake.

06:59.260 --> 07:01.010
Nice to meet you, I'm Meatwad.

07:01.070 --> 07:01.910
So am I.

07:01.970 --> 07:03.740
Have you tried not doing that?

07:04.300 --> 07:05.650
That's no fun.

07:05.700 --> 07:06.880
I don't know what to tell you man.

07:06.940 --> 07:08.420
You know what's gonna happen.

07:08.470 --> 07:10.350
Every time you chop them up
or saw them

07:10.410 --> 07:11.610
they're gonna multiply.

07:11.680 --> 07:13.350
- Every time!
- But I want them dead.

07:13.410 --> 07:15.410
No, no, I know.
I know.

07:16.720 --> 07:18.350
That's your answer science man?

07:19.020 --> 07:20.220
Fetch me the ax.

07:20.290 --> 07:22.160
Here you go.
I sharpened it for you.

07:22.220 --> 07:23.600
Ah ha ha, good!

07:23.660 --> 07:26.030
The meat has dulled my blade.

07:26.630 --> 07:28.100
Hey, can I grab you for a
second?

07:28.160 --> 07:29.230
Sure, what's up?

07:29.290 --> 07:33.170
What's up?

07:33.230 --> 07:35.910
I'm sorry is that out now?

07:35.970 --> 07:38.950
They're meeting on how to form
their own stupid government.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.420
The floor recognizes Meatwad.

07:40.470 --> 07:43.180
But here's the fun part,
they're still trying to decide

07:43.240 --> 07:45.720
on who should bring the juice boxes.

07:45.780 --> 07:47.420
I'd hate for you to go through
that much trouble.

07:47.480 --> 07:48.890
'Cause I can bring juice boxes.

07:48.950 --> 07:52.020
- I can bring juice boxes...
- 75 minutes of this.

07:52.080 --> 07:54.090
Aww, juice boxes are expensive.

07:54.150 --> 07:55.650
Let me bring the juice boxes.

07:55.720 --> 07:58.530
That is so fucking retarded.

07:58.590 --> 08:01.800
We are not establishing a
democracy in this house!

08:01.860 --> 08:03.970
This is a dictatorship!

08:04.030 --> 08:05.670
And I rule with an iron dick!

08:05.730 --> 08:07.400
Let's call the matter to a vote.

08:07.470 --> 08:11.110
Raise your hand if you would
like to bring the juice boxes.

08:11.170 --> 08:13.310
And let's count.

08:13.370 --> 08:15.480
No one can count.
We're deadlocked again.

08:15.540 --> 08:16.680
I demand a recount.

08:16.740 --> 08:18.950
As I said, no one counted right
the first time.

08:19.010 --> 08:20.820
Well, I don't know how to count
right the first time.

08:20.880 --> 08:22.550
- How do you count?
- I don't know.

08:22.610 --> 08:23.460
Let call Carl.

08:23.520 --> 08:28.290
Who wants to vote on who to go
over to Carl's house and get Carl?

08:29.450 --> 08:31.330
Okay, we're deadlocked again.

08:31.390 --> 08:33.340
Frylock, I'm on my last leg.

08:33.390 --> 08:35.740
You need to help me mush all
this together

08:35.789 --> 08:37.169
and set fire to it.

08:37.230 --> 08:38.230
No, no, no, no, no.

08:38.299 --> 08:39.640
I have a better idea.

08:39.700 --> 08:41.580

It's me, Frylock!

09:44.130 --> 09:45.160
You left us.

09:45.230 --> 09:46.070
Yeah man,

09:46.130 --> 09:48.670
I got to thinking how trapped I'd been
all those years you know.

09:48.730 --> 09:51.080
So I wrote a book on the dangers
of co-dependency.

09:51.140 --> 09:52.210
And it was a best seller.

09:52.270 --> 09:54.750
I turned it into a lucrative
franchise of 6 movies,

09:54.810 --> 09:57.480
a TV show,
and a series of self help discs.

09:57.540 --> 09:58.850
I married Cheryl Tiegs,

09:58.910 --> 10:01.120
divorced her and married her
underage granddaughter.

10:01.180 --> 10:03.890
And we live very happily on a
small island south of France

10:03.950 --> 10:05.480
with the New York football
Giants.

lot of time.

the singing.

10:22.870 --> 10:24.440
Oh no,
I already took care of that.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.070
