That's fantastic. We really appreciate it.

Wait. What does <i>Bowling for Columbine</i>
have to do with being Asian?

What? Just 'cause we're Asian,
we can't care about gun violence?

We can only get together

saying earlier before

was slipping away--

09:07.047 --> 09:08.840
Wait. Who said slipping away?

09:08.923 --> 09:11.426
If I were you,
I'd fight for my relationship.

09:12.218 --> 09:15.889
Of course, that would require me
to <i>have </i>a relationship.

Just all of it, Mehar.

09:28.943 --> 09:30.195
Hey, what was wrong with that guy?

09:30.278 --> 09:32.030
He seemed nice. He was hot.

09:32.113 --> 09:33.239
Not my type.

09:33.323 --> 09:34.908
Well, what is your type?

09:34.991 --> 09:36.785
-Maybe I know somebody.
-You don't.

09:36.868 --> 09:38.078
Come on. Try me.

09:38.161 --> 09:40.497
[sighs] Stop following me, crazy man.

09:40.580 --> 09:43.500
The LGBTQIA Union would love to,
but we have a screening

09:43.583 --> 09:45.460
of <i>Bowling for Columbine </i>that night.

09:45.543 --> 09:47.796
Oh, we already talked to Annie,
and they're canceling that, so--

09:47.879 --> 09:49.589
[woman]
Actually, we have our own screening.

09:49.672 --> 09:51.216
But it's nice to hear
that Annie came to her senses

09:51.299 --> 09:52.425
and realized she shouldn't rip off

09:52.509 --> 09:55.011
other people's programming
just to get back at me.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.597
If you come across that bitch again,
tell her it'd be a real shame

09:57.680 --> 09:59.599
if her boyfriend found out
where she really goes

09:59.682 --> 10:01.601
when she says she's at the library.

10:01.684 --> 10:02.977
Okay, so you're busy that night.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.562
-We're gonna go.
-Motherfucker, what?

10:04.646 --> 10:06.189
I got, like, eight million questions.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.316
Girl, so-- Gabe!

10:09.317 --> 10:11.236
How <i>Defamation </i>would it be

10:11.319 --> 10:13.613
if Mehar were Annie's boyfriend?
[chuckles]

10:13.696 --> 10:15.240
Well, as long as we're on hypotheticals,

10:15.323 --> 10:16.533
who should be your boyfriend?

10:16.616 --> 10:18.368
Stop fishing for my type, Gabe.

10:18.451 --> 10:19.994
Come on, man. Bond with me.

10:20.078 --> 10:23.623
[laughs] Okay, fine.

10:23.706 --> 10:26.167
-He needs to be smart...
-Mm-hmm.

10:26.251 --> 10:29.796
...nerdy, but kind of cool,
a little bit of a badass.

10:29.879 --> 10:32.298
-Okay.
-Black.

10:32.382 --> 10:34.801
Actually, black as hell
and unapologetic about it.

10:35.927 --> 10:38.847
Kind of serious, but okay when you
make fun of him for it.

10:39.722 --> 10:42.350
Able to carry a lot on his shoulders.

10:42.433 --> 10:43.977
God, and those shoulders...

10:46.146 --> 10:47.981
You got it bad for Reggie.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.190
[gasps]

10:49.274 --> 10:50.650
Joelle.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.444
Why hasn't this happened yet?

10:53.528 --> 10:54.863
Why do you think?

10:54.946 --> 10:56.239
I have no idea.

11:12.714 --> 11:14.048
Do you think Sam and Reggie are--

11:14.132 --> 11:15.341
I don't know.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.970
I never know anything with her.

11:20.847 --> 11:21.890
As soon as I figure her out,

11:21.973 --> 11:25.226
she pulls back, and then
I-I don't know all over again.

11:27.312 --> 11:28.688
You know what I do know?

11:29.856 --> 11:31.399
-She smiles with you.
-[scoffs]

11:31.482 --> 11:33.735
Hey, that's a scoff...

11:33.818 --> 11:35.653
But I'm serious.

11:35.737 --> 11:39.782
I'm not talking a self-satisfied,
"I was dope on the radio" smile

11:39.866 --> 11:42.201
or a "pissing Troy off is fun" smile.

11:42.285 --> 11:43.912
No, with you, it's...

11:45.330 --> 11:48.041
It's a whole-body thing, head to toe.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.753
With you, she smiles from her socks.

12:03.014 --> 12:05.183
Joelle, I called the cops the other night.

12:07.310 --> 12:08.144
What?

12:08.228 --> 12:10.480
[Reggie] <i>Ooh, I'm sorry, massa.</i>

12:10.563 --> 12:12.273
[Addison] <i>It's a song.</i>
<i>Hell, it's in the title.</i>

12:12.357 --> 12:14.317
<i>-What am I supposed to do? Hum?</i>
-[Reggie] <i>Yes, nigga!</i>

12:14.400 --> 12:16.444
I thought I was protecting everybody.

12:17.445 --> 12:20.239
I thought it would keep things
from getting too out of control.

12:20.323 --> 12:22.367
I thought I was doing the right thing.

12:22.450 --> 12:25.912
I didn't-- I couldn't have known
what was gonna happen.

12:25.995 --> 12:28.206
You absolutely cannot tell Sam.

12:28.289 --> 12:29.290
But if I don't, I'm--

12:29.374 --> 12:32.377
Never mention this again,
because if she finds out...

12:35.755 --> 12:37.382
She can't find out.

12:43.346 --> 12:45.932
[Milo] I mean, I like to mix it up.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.350
[Vanessa] More Malbec, Sam?

12:47.433 --> 12:50.895
Or we can actually open
the bottle you brought.

12:51.562 --> 12:53.356
Never had wine product before.

12:54.565 --> 12:57.110
And it's a screw top. Fun.

12:57.193 --> 12:58.987
-Whatever's fine. Thanks.
-[Milo] It's so good.

12:59.070 --> 13:00.363
You guys have to listen to it.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.865
It's, like, all these great stories
of old Hollywood.

13:02.949 --> 13:05.284
<i>You Must Remember This-- </i>it's incredible.

13:05.368 --> 13:06.619
[both] "Written,

13:06.703 --> 13:08.287
narrated,

13:08.371 --> 13:11.124
and produced by Karina Longworth.

13:11.207 --> 13:12.375
That's me."

13:12.458 --> 13:13.626
[both laugh]

13:13.710 --> 13:14.544
Yes!

13:14.627 --> 13:17.755
I keep telling my friends to listen to it,
but none of them do.

13:17.839 --> 13:21.592
I just heard the one about Spencer Tracy
and Katharine Hepburn.

13:21.676 --> 13:23.344
Oh, my God, they were the best.

13:23.428 --> 13:25.555
Yeah, I mean, their movies--
their movies are great,

13:25.638 --> 13:27.557
but wasn't the affair kind of fucked up?

13:27.640 --> 13:29.225
Why do you hate love, Gabe?

13:29.308 --> 13:31.144
When he got sick,
she took five years off to care for him.

13:31.227 --> 13:32.353
It's so romantic.

13:32.437 --> 13:33.896
I love that story. It's--

13:33.980 --> 13:37.108
Sure, but Tracy was married
the entire time.

13:37.191 --> 13:38.318
What about his wife?

13:39.068 --> 13:40.820
[Sam] Okay, things got messy, but--

13:40.903 --> 13:43.156
So the woman who's getting cheated on,

13:43.239 --> 13:44.866
she's just supposed to make peace with it?

13:44.949 --> 13:47.869
-Who wants some?
-[Sam] I'm not saying they were saints,

13:47.952 --> 13:48.786
but they were soul mates.

13:48.870 --> 13:50.872
Well, it's good to know
you condone affairs.

13:50.955 --> 13:52.457
Anyone want some of Sam's wine?

13:52.540 --> 13:54.459
No! Thank you.

13:55.043 --> 13:56.127
[Sam] Gabe.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.171
Gabe!

13:59.672 --> 14:02.091
If something's wrong,
just tell me something's wrong.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.509
Something's wrong.

14:03.593 --> 14:06.554
-Okay.
-Look, I don't get it, Sam.

14:06.637 --> 14:08.264
Sometimes you want
to spend all your time with me,

14:08.348 --> 14:10.683
and sometimes you pretend I don't exist.

14:11.893 --> 14:13.394
-You're like a dude.
-You're right.

14:13.478 --> 14:15.480
And not even a nice dude.
You're, like, one of those...

14:17.357 --> 14:18.733
What?

14:18.816 --> 14:20.651
I said, "You're right."

14:20.735 --> 14:23.780
Well...
well, now I don't know what to say.

14:26.157 --> 14:27.033
I'm sorry.

14:28.618 --> 14:30.453
Things are...

14:30.536 --> 14:32.288
There's just a lot of...

14:34.123 --> 14:36.876
-It's complicated.
-Yeah.

14:36.959 --> 14:38.628
You're complicated as fuck.

14:39.962 --> 14:42.673
[sighs] That's why I'm crazy about you.

14:42.757 --> 14:45.760
You're a mess,
but, like, in this put-together way.

14:46.094 --> 14:47.762
I love that you use four-letter words

14:47.845 --> 14:49.764
and four-syllable words
in the same sentence.

14:49.847 --> 14:51.099
I love that you're kind of a snob,

14:51.182 --> 14:54.268
but you'll bring a bottle of wine
that's only one step above Colt 45.

14:55.520 --> 14:58.398
I love that you love
Billy Wilder and Garry Marshall.

14:58.981 --> 15:00.483
I love...

15:01.734 --> 15:02.735
you.

15:05.446 --> 15:06.447
Fuck.

15:07.573 --> 15:08.741
I love you.

15:11.369 --> 15:13.121
-Gabe--
-And, look, I know you well enough

15:13.204 --> 15:16.040
to know that, you know,
you're gonna need time,

15:16.124 --> 15:18.000
and I don't expect you
to say anything now.

15:18.084 --> 15:19.460
I love you, too.

15:26.592 --> 15:30.304
[Gabe] So PDA is a yes?

15:30.388 --> 15:32.140
-Mm-mm, it's a no...
-Ah.

15:32.223 --> 15:34.100
-...with exceptions.
-Ah!

15:34.183 --> 15:35.810
[chuckles] Okay, my turn.

15:35.893 --> 15:37.228
Mm-hmm.

15:37.311 --> 15:38.855
You should know

15:38.938 --> 15:42.400
I'll probably be saying "nigga"
around you a lot

15:42.483 --> 15:44.610
because I'll find it funny
you can't say it back.

15:44.694 --> 15:46.195
[laughs] Okay, works for me.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.990
[laughs] Good,
because it wasn't a question.

15:49.073 --> 15:50.908
-It was a warning.
-[laughs]

15:50.992 --> 15:52.034
Oh, I got a weird one.

15:52.118 --> 15:55.079
Uh, I don't think we should do
the whole, uh, Facebook...

15:55.163 --> 15:57.707
-No. Yeah, I agree.
-Okay.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.542
I mean, you're in love.

15:59.625 --> 16:00.960
You don't need "likes" anymore.

16:01.043 --> 16:02.545
Yeah. Oh, and if things go south,

16:02.628 --> 16:04.547
I do not want to see
that fucking crying emoji.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.674
Ah, yeah, fuck that guy.

16:06.757 --> 16:08.259
-And his tears.
-Right?

16:08.342 --> 16:10.136
Like,
we're in an exclusive relationship here.

16:10.219 --> 16:11.929
It does not involve you, you sad bastard.

16:12.013 --> 16:13.222
[chuckles]

16:15.308 --> 16:18.436
You know, as long as
we're honest with each other,

16:18.519 --> 16:20.271
who needs extra pressure?

16:21.564 --> 16:23.691
And we're honest with each other.

16:24.233 --> 16:25.193
Yeah.

16:25.902 --> 16:27.320
Exactly.

16:31.324 --> 16:34.327
Can our couple name be "Gam"?

16:35.411 --> 16:36.579
[quietly] Gam...

16:36.662 --> 16:39.373
Like an old-timey lady leg?

16:39.457 --> 16:40.917
Yeah.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.127
-Yeah, I'm in.
-Yeah?

16:43.211 --> 16:46.255
Yeah, 'cause then people will be like,
"Oh, check out them Gam."

16:46.339 --> 16:47.715
[laughs]

17:14.742 --> 17:16.661
[chuckles softly]

17:16.744 --> 17:19.247
Were you watching me sleep, nigga?

17:19.330 --> 17:20.873
[both laughing]

17:20.957 --> 17:23.584
You can't say it back.

17:27.129 --> 17:29.090
[cell phone chimes]

17:33.761 --> 17:35.304
Holy shit.

17:36.097 --> 17:39.225
Uh, hey, maybe-- maybe
we should get some breakfast.

17:39.308 --> 17:41.018
Lionel is so goddamn good.

17:41.102 --> 17:43.020
He got the 911 audio
from the night of the party

17:43.104 --> 17:44.772
proving that cop overreacted.

17:44.855 --> 17:46.399
I'm--I'm really glad.

17:46.482 --> 17:48.818
Uh, Sam, uh, I think, uh, we should--

17:48.901 --> 17:50.403
-Hold on, I got to hear it.
-No, Sam.

17:50.486 --> 17:53.447
It's, like, already 8:00, you know?
People are gonna start coming in any--

17:53.531 --> 17:54.490
[man] <i>Campus security.</i>

17:54.574 --> 17:56.242
[Gabe] <i>Hi, yeah. I'm at 2306 Bradford.</i>

17:56.325 --> 17:58.578
<i>This party's a little out of control.</i>
<i>Could you send some officers?</i>

17:58.661 --> 18:00.788
<i>I'm really afraid</i>
<i>someone's gonna get hurt.</i>

18:03.165 --> 18:04.959
That could be anybody.

18:07.795 --> 18:08.963
[sighs] Okay, look,

18:09.046 --> 18:11.966
I was gonna tell you
as soon as things calmed down.

18:12.049 --> 18:14.427
There's no way I could have known
what was gonna happen to Reggie.

18:15.344 --> 18:18.264
It's not like I called the cops thinking
they were gonna come and pull a gun.

18:18.347 --> 18:19.974
I didn't even know they carried guns.

18:20.057 --> 18:21.058
[sighs] Wha...

18:22.643 --> 18:24.353
Sam...

18:24.437 --> 18:26.606
please say something.

18:32.695 --> 18:33.696
[grunts]

18:40.036 --> 18:41.954
-[dialing]
-[line ringing]

18:42.038 --> 18:44.206
[exhales]

18:46.959 --> 18:49.003
<i>It's Sam. Leave a message.</i>

18:49.086 --> 18:50.296
[line beeps]

18:53.591 --> 18:54.425
Reggie...

18:55.676 --> 18:57.511
my comrade-in-arms,

18:57.595 --> 19:00.348
it was Gabe who dropped the dime
to the pigs.

19:01.557 --> 19:04.143
-[bottle shatters]
-I knew it, my Nubian sister.

19:04.226 --> 19:06.771
I never trusted that white devil no way,

19:06.854 --> 19:08.731
but now we don't have to feel guilty

19:08.814 --> 19:10.274
about your brown skin

19:10.358 --> 19:12.068
up against my browner skin.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.653
[both grunt]

19:14.904 --> 19:17.907
[line ringing]

19:19.325 --> 19:20.993
<i>It's Sam. Leave a message.</i>

19:21.077 --> 19:21.994
[line beeps]

19:22.078 --> 19:24.205
Sam, come on.

19:24.288 --> 19:27.416
I've-- I've left you, like,
a stalker-y number of messages.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.043
W-w-we need to talk.

19:34.215 --> 19:35.508
Sam?

19:38.010 --> 19:40.596
[sighs] Come on, Sam, give me a chance.

19:49.313 --> 19:52.316
[shouting]

19:58.322 --> 19:59.949
I don't know, but we need
to figure out something.

20:00.032 --> 20:02.076
Sam's your best friend.

20:02.159 --> 20:04.620
[shouting continues]

20:06.914 --> 20:08.666
[overlapping chatter quiets]

20:19.343 --> 20:22.221
Sam, can we, uh...

20:28.477 --> 20:31.522
-Look, I-I-I can explain--
-Why would you call the cops?

20:31.605 --> 20:33.983
-What the fuck did you think would happen?
-You should have known better.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.651
Do black people make you uncomfortable?

20:35.735 --> 20:37.695
[woman] This isn't a good place for you.

20:37.778 --> 20:39.572
That's not actually
what the article was about.

20:39.655 --> 20:41.991
-Guys, let's cut him some slack.
-He called the cops.
