Live from
Hollywood, it's "America's got

00:07.138 --> 00:14.746
talent ‐‐ the results."
Welcome to Hollywood.

00:14.746 --> 00:16.381
We're back after our break from
the Olympics.

00:16.381 --> 00:18.483
And tonight, we find out who is
going to move one step closer to

00:18.483 --> 00:21.152
winning the biggest talent show
on earth.

00:21.152 --> 00:26.358
But before we get going, we
already know the greatest

00:26.358 --> 00:29.494
athlete on the planet.
He just won his 23rd gold medal

00:29.494 --> 00:30.000
at the rio Olympics.
And he's won a total of 66 gold

00:30.000 --> 00:33.698

Mike, now, we all know how

01:32.557 --> 01:34.926
humble you are and everything,
but can you describe the moment

01:34.926 --> 01:42.067
when you won your 23rd gold
medal?

01:42.067 --> 01:45.770
>> It's so hard because it's ‐‐

01:45.770 --> 01:48.406
like I think at that moment it
was when all the emotions came

01:48.406 --> 01:50.942
out.
Because I was finally happy with

01:50.942 --> 01:52.811
everything that I did in my
career.

01:52.811 --> 01:56.047
And I was able to retire how I
wanted to.

There watching the race.

02:05.356 --> 02:09.394
And he wasn't always awake, but
it's a completely different

02:09.394 --> 02:12.597
experience being able to look up
and see your baby boy up there

02:12.597 --> 02:15.567
- after a race.
- Awesome.

02:15.567 --> 02:19.304
But not just an incredible
athlete, an incredible father as

02:19.304 --> 02:21.506
well.
Now, all of our acts are

02:21.506 --> 02:25.877
searching for success.
What drives you to succeed?

02:25.877 --> 02:29.781
>> I late to lose, number one.
I mean, that's the first thing.

02:29.781 --> 02:30.000
My biggest thing was I started
goal setting at like 9 years

02:30.000 --> 02:34.219
my biggest thing was I started
goal setting at like 9 years

02:34.219 --> 02:37.155
old.
And I literally dreamt for the

02:37.155 --> 02:40.125
stars and dreamt for the biggest
possible thing I could think of.

02:40.125 --> 02:43.294
So I basically said I wanted to
change the sport of swimming,

02:43.294 --> 02:46.931
and I wanted to do something
that nobody had ever done

02:46.931 --> 02:48.366
- before.
- That's what it's all

02:48.366 --> 02:49.701
about.
Living the dream.

02:49.701 --> 02:52.403
Like our acts are doing on
"America's got talent."

03:14.959 --> 03:16.427
only some can stay in the
competition.

03:16.427 --> 03:18.396
The stakes could not have been
higher last night.

03:18.396 --> 03:26.337
Here's how it went down.
>> There's only seven spots left

03:26.337 --> 03:30.000

14:12.981 --> 14:16.384
I mean, superfly.
>> I do what I can.

14:16.384 --> 14:20.889
We'll see you next time
in the dunkin' lounge.

14:20.889 --> 14:27.729
- Agt rocks!
- Always a party.

14:27.729 --> 14:30.532
Okay.
Time to get nervous again.

14:30.532 --> 14:33.368
We're about to find out which
act is the first to make it into

14:33.368 --> 14:36.025
the semifinals, based on your
votes.

14:36.025 --> 14:36.838
The semifinals, based on your
votes.

14:36.838 --> 14:46.915
Good luck to all of you.

Please step forward.

15:06.025 --> 15:07.702
And Kaden Bart rockett.
Please step forward.

15:07.702 --> 15:11.840
This is it.
One act is through.

15:11.840 --> 15:17.111
One act is heading home.
America has voted.

15:17.111 --> 15:36.025
The first act going into the
semifinals is ‐‐

15:36.025 --> 15:37.382
the first act going into the
semifinals is ‐‐

15:37.382 --> 15:46.007
Kaden Bart rockett.

15:46.007 --> 15:47.775
Alla and Daniel, thank you very
much.

15:47.775 --> 15:53.715
You guys are awesome.
Supertalented.

15:53.715 --> 15:56.551
Those are tears of joy, right?
>> Yes.

15:56.551 --> 16:00.955
How does it feel?
>> Thank you all of America.

16:00.955 --> 16:04.559
>> Thank you, America, for
voting.

16:04.559 --> 16:06.025
- Thank you so much.
- Aw.

16:06.025 --> 16:06.361
- Thank you so much.
- Aw.

16:06.361 --> 16:09.464
Pulling at my heartstrings.
Heidi, you loved their

16:09.464 --> 16:13.434
performance last night.
What advice do you have for

16:13.434 --> 16:15.737
- them?
- Honestly, you don't

16:15.737 --> 16:18.907
need any advice.
You did such a fantastic job.

16:18.907 --> 16:21.843
Think about it, you beat out so
many adults last night.

16:21.843 --> 16:26.281
- Good luck for the next round.
- Can I say something?

16:26.281 --> 16:31.319
My advice is, can you make Howie
disappear?

16:31.319 --> 16:32.854
We'll work on that,

16:32.854 --> 16:33.988
right?
Congrats.

16:33.988 --> 16:36.025
You guys made it into the
semifinals.

16:36.025 --> 16:37.325
You guys made it into the
semifinals.

16:37.325 --> 16:41.663
Now go eat peanut butter and
jelly and jelly beans, all that

16:41.663 --> 16:45.700
good stuff.
Kaden Bart rockett.

16:45.700 --> 16:49.337
Thank you very much.
Now, there are six spots left.

16:49.337 --> 16:55.143
Who else is through?
Let's find out.

16:55.143 --> 17:06.025
Grace vanderwaal.
And Brian Justin crum.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.989
Grace vanderwaal.
And Brian Justin crum.

17:07.989 --> 17:27.976
Please step forward.
Who killed it last night?

17:27.976 --> 17:36.025
Grace and Brian, America has
voted.

17:36.025 --> 17:36.050
Grace and Brian, America has
voted.

17:36.050 --> 17:57.834
The next act going into the
semifinals is ‐‐

17:57.834 --> 18:06.025
both of you!

18:06.025 --> 18:08.316
Both of you!

18:08.316 --> 18:16.190
You okay?
Having both of you up here, that

18:16.190 --> 18:17.859
was a little nerve‐racking,
right?

18:17.859 --> 18:20.328
>> You guys got me.
Tricked me over here.

18:20.328 --> 18:22.864
I saw it go through
your brain.

18:22.864 --> 18:26.401
I saw it.
Howie, you're standing on your

18:26.401 --> 18:29.303
feet.
Of course, Grace was your golden

18:29.303 --> 18:31.839
buzzer, but you said Brian was
epic last night.

18:31.839 --> 18:35.610
Oh, my gosh.
My heart just jumped out of my

18:35.610 --> 18:36.025
shirt.
Epic and wonderful and

18:36.025 --> 18:37.011
shirt.
Epic and wonderful and

18:37.011 --> 18:38.513
beautiful.
This is a higher line.

18:38.513 --> 18:41.616
Those two people standing right
there are a higher level of

18:41.616 --> 18:44.185
talent than we've ever had.
You know what I call this.

18:44.185 --> 18:48.022
You know the term win‐win?
That's what this show should be.

18:48.022 --> 18:51.759
This show should have a win‐win.
You're both worthy.

18:51.759 --> 18:54.062
I think we're looking at the
finals right now.

18:54.062 --> 18:57.799
Look into those faces.
America, we're looking at the

18:57.799 --> 18:59.634
- final.
- Simon cowell, this is

18:59.634 --> 19:01.536
your type of talent right here,
right?

19:01.536 --> 19:05.807
You love these people.
Do you want to say something to

19:05.807 --> 19:06.025
- them.
- Who?

19:06.025 --> 19:07.108
- Them.
- Who?

19:07.108 --> 19:09.343
You!
You're Simon cowell.

19:09.343 --> 19:12.180
I'm annoyed with you
because you just gave me a heart

19:12.180 --> 19:14.015
attack.
I thought we were going to lose

19:14.015 --> 19:16.117
one.
As Howie just said, this is what

19:16.117 --> 19:18.886
the show is all about.
No matter what your age is,

19:18.886 --> 19:21.489
you've got to aim to win.
What I love about the show this

19:21.489 --> 19:23.357
year is that everybody wants to
win.

19:23.357 --> 19:26.994
And that makes it exciting.
Good for both of you.

19:26.994 --> 19:29.797
Outstanding job.
Keeping the dream alive.

19:29.797 --> 19:34.869
We'll see you guys in the
semifinals.

19:34.869 --> 19:36.025
So three acts are through.
There's four spots left.

19:36.025 --> 19:39.674
So three acts are through.
There's four spots left.

19:39.674 --> 19:51.319
And don't forget, you can decide
who gets one of those spots.

19:51.319 --> 19:54.222
After the break, more acts get
the news they want to hear.

19:54.222 --> 19:57.458
And one of our most popular acts
from the past will be tearing up

19:57.458 --> 19:59.818
the stage.
Stay right there.

20:11.759 --> 20:14.071
This is "America's got
talent ‐‐ the results."

20:14.071 --> 20:18.575
So far tonight,
Kaden Bart rockett, Grace

20:18.575 --> 20:23.280
vanderwaal and Brian Justin crum
are all through to the

20:23.280 --> 20:24.715
semifinals.
And there's still time for you

20:24.715 --> 20:32.923
to save one of these acts right
here with the dunkin' save.

20:32.923 --> 20:35.538
You have about 13 minutes to
vote.

20:35.538 --> 20:36.793
You have about 13 minutes to
vote.

20:36.793 --> 20:39.463
For all of them, their future is
in your hands.

20:39.463 --> 20:44.101
Back in 2009, an act walked out
on to the stage with a

20:44.101 --> 20:45.869
bunch of buckets and trash cans
and blew everybody away with

20:45.869 --> 20:47.804
their sensational drumming.
Since then, they've been killing

20:47.804 --> 20:49.373
it in their own show in
las Vegas.

20:49.373 --> 20:52.042

about that performance, man?
>> It was awesome.

23:46.283 --> 23:50.654

Awesome.

24:09.706 --> 24:12.742
After the break, two more acts
go straight into the semifinals.

I mean, your voice is just a
powerhouse.

26:49.178 --> 26:52.281

28:16.298 --> 28:16.965
awesome.
So cool.

28:16.965 --> 28:21.070
Love what you do.
Big fan.

28:21.070 --> 28:23.395
Blake, man, what's going through
your mind right now?

28:23.395 --> 28:23.539
Blake, man, what's going through
your mind right now?

28:23.539 --> 28:26.375
>> Oh, I'm so excited.
Thank you to everybody that

28:26.375 --> 28:28.477

Thank you, thank you.

28:28.477 --> 28:31.780
Heidi, what do you want
to say to Blake?

28:31.780 --> 28:35.484
Blake, I'm
superpsyched for you.

28:35.484 --> 28:40.756
Youallergies who
is boss.

28:40.756 --> 28:43.092
Good luck in the next round.
>> Thank you.

28:43.092 --> 28:46.662
Simon, say something to
my man, Mr. vogt here.

28:46.662 --> 28:49.631
I said to Blake.
I saw Blake afterwards last

28:49.631 --> 28:51.533
night.
I said I see a huge difference

28:51.533 --> 28:53.395
in guy we first met who is very
shy.

28:53.395 --> 28:54.670
In guy we first met who is very
shy.

28:54.670 --> 28:57.873
Suddenly he's got charisma and
showmanship.

28:57.873 --> 28:59.808
I don't know how you did what
you did last night.

28:59.808 --> 29:02.945
I'm also relieved that I'll not
be part of the next show with

29:02.945 --> 29:08.450
those jugglers.
Thank you, America.

29:08.450 --> 29:11.120
Keeping the dream
alive.

29:11.120 --> 29:13.655
We'll definitely see you in the
semifinals.

29:13.655 --> 29:16.992
All right?
Still to come, the result of

29:16.992 --> 29:20.162
tonight's dunkin' save vote.
You've still got time to get

29:20.162 --> 29:22.931
your votes in.
But the vote is closing very,

29:22.931 --> 29:23.395
very soon.
Coming up, we've got an olympic

29:23.395 --> 29:26.034
very soon.
Coming up, we've got an olympic

29:26.034 --> 29:30.105
competition with the judges, but
it's not exactly a traditional

29:30.105 --> 29:32.223
event.
See what I mean after the break.

29:48.532 --> 29:51.134
Welcome back.
This is "America's got talent ‐‐

29:51.134 --> 29:56.440
the results."
I'm here with olympic

29:56.440 --> 30:00.108
mega‐champion Michael Phelps.
Now, Mike, what advice do you

30:00.108 --> 30:02.043
have for the acts going through
to the next round?

30:02.043 --> 30:05.780
>> I mean, for us, like whenever
we were kind of relaxed and

30:05.780 --> 30:09.551
playing cards or joking, like
just trying to enjoy the whole

30:09.551 --> 30:10.379
experience.
And I think like these guys,

30:10.379 --> 30:12.053
experience.
And I think like these guys,

30:12.053 --> 30:14.889
these guys have prepared for
this for a long time.

30:14.889 --> 30:16.891
You know.
So it's just like get out there

30:16.891 --> 30:19.260
and have fun.
That's one thing that we've

30:19.260 --> 30:22.063
always done really, really well.
Just have fun.

30:22.063 --> 30:24.499
As long as you have a smile on
your face.

30:24.499 --> 30:26.868
That's what this show
is all about, fun.

30:26.868 --> 30:31.239
Speaking of fun, in your honor,
we had a little olympic

30:31.239 --> 30:33.975
competition of our own with the
judges.

30:33.975 --> 30:36.011
But, as you'll see, winning was
the last thing anybody wanted to

30:36.011 --> 30:40.379
do.
Take a look.

30:40.379 --> 30:41.082
Do.
Take a look.

30:41.082 --> 30:45.954
Welcome to "ranked out."
The game where the judge judges

third on a number of different

30:53.595 --> 30:57.599
topics.

Okay.
Here's the first topic.

31:10.379 --> 31:12.514
Okay.
Here's the first topic.

31:12.514 --> 31:15.683
Oh, god.
This is relatively easy.

31:15.683 --> 31:20.055
Howie, can you stand on number
three.

31:20.055 --> 31:23.024
- Number three?

31:23.024 --> 31:28.129
Mel, could you go to number one,

31:28.129 --> 31:37.439
The topic was, who has
the worst accent.

31:37.439 --> 31:40.379
What?
Why?

31:40.379 --> 31:45.847

Why?

31:45.847 --> 31:49.684

- What is this?

32:04.466 --> 32:09.604
- What is it?
- The topic was, who is

32:09.604 --> 32:10.379
- the most irritating?
- You know what?

32:10.379 --> 32:13.708
- The most irritating?
- You know what?

32:13.708 --> 32:17.946
- I like this game.
- What's wrong with you

32:17.946 --> 32:20.348
today?
I don't think so.

32:20.348 --> 32:23.184
- No.
- We're finding out how

32:23.184 --> 32:26.988
- Simon really feels.

32:26.988 --> 32:30.191

32:40.902 --> 32:43.271
- the back?
- don't go in the back.

32:43.271 --> 32:49.244
And the topic was, who
is the biggest diva?

32:49.244 --> 32:53.715
- What?
- Not true.

32:53.715 --> 33:01.789
- Come on.
- Here's your final

33:01.789 --> 33:03.358
- topic.
- This is going to

33:03.358 --> 33:10.379
involve you, actually.
Actually, girls stand as far

33:10.379 --> 33:10.398
involve you, actually.
Actually, girls stand as far

33:10.398 --> 33:11.733
away from number three with
Howie, please.

33:11.733 --> 33:23.111
Quite far away.
You go up to number one.

33:23.111 --> 33:28.216
And the topic was who
would you most like to be

33:28.216 --> 33:32.987
stranded on an island with?
Thanks, Simon.

33:32.987 --> 33:38.893
- We'll go to Jamaica.
- I would like to keep

33:38.893 --> 33:40.379
playing, but I've got to go
number one right now.

33:40.379 --> 33:42.664
Playing, but I've got to go
number one right now.

33:42.664 --> 33:50.705
Mr. Phelps, would you

33:50.705 --> 33:54.876
want to be stranded on a desert
island with Simon cowell over

33:54.876 --> 33:57.612
there?
>> I think I'd rather be with my

33:57.612 --> 34:00.748
- fiancee and my baby boy.
- Of course.

34:00.748 --> 34:03.952
But if you were on an island
with Simon, at least you could

34:03.952 --> 34:05.587
swim pretty well to get away
from him.

34:05.587 --> 34:09.357
It works out.
Well, I've got some results and

34:09.357 --> 34:10.379
all of that stuff to get to.
But ladies and gentlemen, you

34:10.379 --> 34:12.193
all of that stuff to get to.
But ladies and gentlemen, you

34:12.193 --> 34:18.199
got to give it up for the one
and only, incredible Michael

34:18.199 --> 34:19.133
Phelps.

34:19.133 --> 34:28.710
Thanks, Mike.
All right.

34:28.710 --> 34:31.279
So far tonight your votes have
put five acts through to the

34:31.279 --> 34:37.085

But we still have three waiting

34:37.085 --> 34:39.320

35:56.097 --> 35:57.298
- Yeah.
- How does it feel?

35:57.298 --> 36:03.871
>> It feels fantastic.
I would like ‐‐ I think it was a

36:03.871 --> 36:09.243
big moment for our directors
matias to say a couple of words.

36:09.243 --> 36:10.379
Absolutely.
>> I do not speak very well, but

36:10.379 --> 36:11.946
absolutely.
>> I do not speak very well, but

36:11.946 --> 36:15.450
I want to say all of you, thank
you.

36:15.450 --> 36:20.621
We are really happy to be here.
Thank you, America.

36:20.621 --> 36:24.692
Awesome.
Simon, do you agree with

36:24.692 --> 36:29.097
- America's choice, Mr. cowell?
- I think it's

36:29.097 --> 36:31.699
absolutely right.
I just couldn't imagine the

36:31.699 --> 36:34.602
semifinals, I have to be honest
with you, without you guys.

36:34.602 --> 36:38.206
It's a tough competition this
year, but this is a competition.

36:38.206 --> 36:40.379
You have to improve.
You have to get better.

36:40.379 --> 36:40.975
You have to improve.
You have to get better.

36:40.975 --> 36:43.945
I know you have determination.
I look forward to seeing you in

36:43.945 --> 36:46.314
the semifinals.
Congratulations.

37:34.695 --> 37:38.566
It is beautiful.
>> Thank you, Howie.

37:38.566 --> 37:40.379
The way that your voices
blend together, it makes me

37:40.379 --> 37:41.669
the way that your voices
blend together, it makes me

37:41.669 --> 37:47.542
melt.
I loved it.

37:47.542 --> 37:49.744
Every time you sing
it's like you're giving us a

37:49.744 --> 37:56.317
gift.

it into the semifinals.
Linkin' bridge and ronee Martin.

39:38.339 --> 39:42.476
Only one of them can go through.
And it's up to our judges to

39:42.476 --> 39:48.749
make that decision.
Judges, the decision is yours.

39:48.749 --> 39:52.400
Mel b., who do you want to put
through to the semifinals?

39:52.400 --> 39:56.324
Mel b., who do you want to put
through to the semifinals?

39:56.324 --> 40:01.062
Oh, ronee, last night
you sang your heart and soul

40:01.062 --> 40:03.431
out.
I love you, you're a classy,

40:03.431 --> 40:06.834
lovely lady.
Gosh, it's so hard.

40:06.834 --> 40:10.304
Linkin' bridge, you've got soul,
too, and you've got an amazing

40:10.304 --> 40:15.876
story and I love your vibe.
Listen, it wasn't perfect.

40:15.876 --> 40:20.248
It definitely could have been
better.

40:20.248 --> 40:22.400
This is so not fair.
I'm going to go with

40:22.400 --> 40:24.660
this is so not fair.
I'm going to go with

40:24.660 --> 40:33.928
- linkin' bridge.
- Lincoln bridge.

40:33.928 --> 40:35.329
- Howie?
- Me?

40:35.329 --> 40:39.533
- Yes, sir.
- I have to say that

40:39.533 --> 40:41.402
ronee, you seem like you're
already a star.

40:41.402 --> 40:44.472
You talk about not making it,
but I think you're doing it and

40:44.472 --> 40:47.375
you're making it.
I watched you on that stage and

40:47.375 --> 40:51.045
you deserve to be here.
Linkin' bridge, your story and

40:51.045 --> 40:52.400
your voice is beyond ‐‐ it's so
inspirational and it means so

40:52.400 --> 40:57.018
your voice is beyond ‐‐ it's so
inspirational and it means so

40:57.018 --> 41:01.822
much more.
You are so surprising for me.

41:01.822 --> 41:06.025
This show is about surprises.
And that's why my vote has to go

41:06.025 --> 41:13.768
- to linkin' bridge.
- All right.

41:13.768 --> 41:16.337
- Heidi?
- I love you guys,

41:16.337 --> 41:18.773
linkin' bridge.
You told you guys last night, I

41:18.773 --> 41:22.400
love when you sing together, I
love you individually.

41:22.400 --> 41:23.778
Love when you sing together, I
love you individually.

41:23.778 --> 41:27.782
Ronee, you have been waiting for
this moment for a really long

41:27.782 --> 41:32.920
- time.
- Less than a minute.

41:32.920 --> 41:37.158
- Ronee.
- Simon, less than a

41:37.158 --> 41:39.493
- minute.
- You know what, guys, I

41:39.493 --> 41:42.596
was disappointed with your song
choice last night.

41:42.596 --> 41:46.434
And we discussed that.
And ronee, you've waited a long

41:46.434 --> 41:50.237
time for this opportunity.
My vote is to the person who I

41:50.237 --> 41:52.400
believe has a better chance of
doing well in the semifinals and

41:52.400 --> 41:54.408
believe has a better chance of
doing well in the semifinals and

41:54.408 --> 41:59.243
my vote to go into the
semifinals is

41:59.243 --> 42:01.382
linkin' bridge.

42:01.382 --> 42:05.686
Linkin' bridge.
Ronee, thank you so much.

42:05.686 --> 42:08.756
Guys, congratulations.
How did it feel?

42:08.756 --> 42:12.426

You know what?

42:12.426 --> 42:15.885
- We want to thank.
- Everyone!

42:15.885 --> 42:19.565
