[David Chang] When I'm plating a dish,

00:22.272 --> 00:25.942
I want to capture my inner being
in relation to nature.

00:27.861 --> 00:30.947
I'm painting a canvas
and representing Mother Earth.

00:34.534 --> 00:38.788
Every ingredient captured on my plate
is living and breathing.

00:42.041 --> 00:44.669
It needs to be perfectly balanced.

00:47.172 --> 00:48.423
It's not just about the food.

00:51.009 --> 00:52.635
It's something more.

01:07.275 --> 01:08.985
Have you ever seen lightning?

01:09.069 --> 01:10.320
I have.

01:16.493 --> 01:18.244
["Alpha And Omega" playing]

01:27.462 --> 01:28.755
[Serena Dai] So, when you guys go
to Chinese restaurants,

01:28.838 --> 01:29.881
do you order fried rice?

01:29.964 --> 01:32.342
Is that something
you eat on a regular basis?

01:32.425 --> 01:34.010
[Alan Yang] I have a soft spot for it.

01:34.093 --> 01:37.305
One of my favorite foods growing up
was my mom cooking fried rice.

01:37.388 --> 01:39.891
So simple, so basic.

01:39.974 --> 01:44.521
She would sometimes make a version
with just scrambled egg and scallions.

01:44.604 --> 01:45.980
And it was really good.

01:46.064 --> 01:47.857
Fried rice, to me, is a hangover food,

01:47.941 --> 01:51.111
so I actually don't order
at restaurants because my...

01:51.194 --> 01:52.862
Every time I was in China
and we were at a restaurant,

01:52.946 --> 01:55.156
my mom would be like,
"No, rice is the filler."

01:55.240 --> 01:58.535
I often eat fried rice at home
for breakfast.

01:58.618 --> 02:00.495
Very often with an egg over it.

02:00.578 --> 02:02.872
In fact, I bring cooked rice
from our restaurant

02:02.956 --> 02:06.709
so that it'll be cold the next day
and I don't have to cook some fresh rice.

02:06.793 --> 02:10.922
Today, I ordered golden fried rice.
It was the number one choice.

02:11.005 --> 02:13.967
-I don't know what "golden" meant, but...
-[all laugh]

02:14.050 --> 02:17.387
Fried rice is something
that's humble in origin...

02:17.470 --> 02:19.681
will never be a $1,000 dish,

02:19.764 --> 02:23.351
unless you put caviar and truffles on it,
which I'm sure some asshole's gonna do.

02:23.434 --> 02:26.354
-With uni and caviar.
-Fried rice with caviar is awesome.

02:26.437 --> 02:27.564
[Yang] Jesus, man.

02:27.647 --> 02:29.524
-Here's the asshole we were looking for.
-[Dai laughing]

02:29.607 --> 02:31.651
He's sitting at our table. [laughs]

02:31.734 --> 02:32.735
[Chang] Speaking of rice,

02:32.819 --> 02:36.656
one of my big pet peeves when people
talk about Chinese food is,

02:36.739 --> 02:39.325
"Oh, I love Panda Express,
but I won't eat this.

02:39.409 --> 02:41.870
I love P.F. Chang's.
That's Chinese food."

02:41.953 --> 02:46.249
-I'm like, "No, it's not."

[Jennifer 8. Lee] Chinese food is the most
pervasive food on the planet.

03:06.019 --> 03:09.314
It's served on all seven continents,
even Antarctica,

03:09.397 --> 03:11.900
'cause Monday night is Chinese food
night at McMurdo Station.

03:12.525 --> 03:13.985
There's Chinese food in space.

03:14.068 --> 03:16.529
NASA serves sweet and sour pork
to astronauts.

03:17.864 --> 03:20.783
So, there are more
Chinese restaurants in America

03:20.867 --> 03:24.871
than McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's
and Kentucky Fried Chickens combined.

03:24.954 --> 03:27.957
The dishes like
General Tso's chicken and egg rolls

03:28.041 --> 03:30.043
are completely indigenous to America.

03:30.126 --> 03:31.961
-Kung Pao chicken!
-[groans]

03:32.045 --> 03:32.921
[women scream]

03:33.004 --> 03:36.299
364 days of the year,
Americans eat Chinese food,

03:36.382 --> 03:38.009
and one day of the year
they eat turkey.

03:38.092 --> 03:42.055
Thanksgiving is the number one day
for Chinese weddings in America.

03:42.138 --> 03:44.849
If our benchmark for Americanness
is apple pie,

03:44.933 --> 03:47.560
you should ask yourself
how often you eat Chinese food

03:47.644 --> 03:49.812
versus how often you eat apple pie.

03:49.896 --> 03:52.732
I wanna put that egg roll
in my mouth hole.

03:55.485 --> 03:58.279
[Yang] There's this idea
of a monolithic Chinese food,

03:58.363 --> 03:59.530
like, "Let's go get Chinese food."

03:59.614 --> 04:03.284
And you go to a place
and there's 250 things on the menu.

04:03.368 --> 04:06.329
It's part of our beautiful tapestry
of foods, guys.

04:06.412 --> 04:08.373
You gotta have it all, right?

04:08.456 --> 04:11.084
I wanna know how you felt,
growing up in Hong Kong,

04:11.167 --> 04:13.127
what Chinese food in America was.

04:13.211 --> 04:15.505
What did you think or hear about it?

04:15.588 --> 04:19.591
When I came here in 1986,

04:19.676 --> 04:22.011
I see, oh, American Chinese food.

04:22.095 --> 04:25.098
Very sweet and sour.

04:25.181 --> 04:28.101
-[Yang] Orange chicken, sweet and sour.
-Stuff like that.

04:28.184 --> 04:31.312
I look at a dish
and this is how I almost look at

04:31.396 --> 04:33.523
Chinese-American food
versus Chinese-mainland food is,

04:33.606 --> 04:35.400
"Will white people eat this?"

04:36.025 --> 04:39.028
-[Dai] Right.
-[Chang] And I don't know.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.571
This dish, I don't know.

04:40.655 --> 04:42.615
I think it's amazing.
You have textural contrast...

04:42.699 --> 04:44.367
[Schoenfeld] I think white people
will eat this in a hot second.

04:44.450 --> 04:45.827
[Chang] But you're not like
a white person.

04:45.910 --> 04:46.828
Oh, no.

04:46.911 --> 04:51.416
You would have to explain it,
give it a frame of reference.

04:51.499 --> 04:55.169
It's like a spring roll,
like a fried crab sushi roll, almost,

04:55.253 --> 04:56.587
whereas that's how you explain it.

04:56.671 --> 04:58.172
You're talking about
how you get them to sell it.

04:58.256 --> 05:00.258
I'm talking about
how you get them to enjoy it.

05:00.341 --> 05:03.928
So, going back to
what Chinese-American food is,

05:04.012 --> 05:06.139
I remember growing up
and I would talk to people,

05:06.222 --> 05:07.807
they would always say,
I remember when I was a kid,

05:07.890 --> 05:09.892
how bad Chinese food was in China.

05:09.976 --> 05:12.186
Even now,
I spoke to a friend of ours,

05:12.270 --> 05:14.272
a comedian, he was like,
"Chinese food's terrible."

05:14.355 --> 05:17.358
And I was like, "Man, you are a smart,
sophisticated, intelligent guy.

05:17.442 --> 05:19.193
How do you think this?"

05:19.277 --> 05:22.238
Because he grew up thinking that
Chinese food is Chinese-American,

05:22.322 --> 05:25.491
and when he goes to China,
it's not remotely the same.

05:25.575 --> 05:28.536
["Going To The Country" playing]

05:49.140 --> 05:55.188
The food of China is extraordinarily
diverse, very complex, and way more

05:55.271 --> 06:00.651
than what most people think of,
like take-out delivery fried rice.

06:00.735 --> 06:02.028
-Totally.
-[both laughing]

06:02.111 --> 06:04.781
China's more of a continent
than a country,

06:04.864 --> 06:08.576
and one Chinese province
is like a European country.

06:08.659 --> 06:10.244
And I like to remember

06:10.328 --> 06:13.581
that Chinese people
often talk about "Western food,"

06:13.664 --> 06:18.002
and they often say "Western food"
is very monotonous and very simple.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.379
To anyone from the West, that's crazy,

06:20.463 --> 06:23.216
because you've got French food,
Italian, American, everything,

06:23.299 --> 06:25.968
and you can't talk about them
all in one word.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.637
But we do that with Chinese food.

06:40.942 --> 06:42.568
-[Chang] Whoa.
-[Dunlop speaks Mandarin]

06:42.652 --> 06:43.569
[woman speaking Mandarin]

06:43.653 --> 06:45.154
[in English] So, these are yuan yang.

06:45.238 --> 06:49.992
These are Mandarin ducks,
which are a symbol of marital harmony.

06:50.076 --> 06:53.371
They're made of egg white.
They're like floating islands.

06:53.454 --> 06:55.706
And the waitresses are dressed
in Manchu costumes.

06:55.790 --> 07:01.003
It's a throwback to the Manchu
imperial court of the Qing dynasty.

07:01.087 --> 07:03.172
Oh, and this is your favorite food,
isn't it?

07:03.256 --> 07:04.173
Oh, no.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.592
-It's more sea cucumber.
-[Dunlop] Sea cucumber.

07:06.676 --> 07:09.762
Yeah, and this is
a real classic Shandong dish.

07:10.346 --> 07:12.849
Easily my least favorite food
in the world.

07:12.932 --> 07:15.393
I want to convert you,
'cause I love them,

07:15.476 --> 07:16.644
and if you're going to like sea cucumber,

07:16.727 --> 07:18.688
this is the best way to try them.

07:18.771 --> 07:21.149
[Chang] It makes me nauseous
thinking about it.

07:21.232 --> 07:23.317
You especially requested this dish.

07:23.401 --> 07:27.238
These are tendons from deer's feet.

07:27.321 --> 07:29.615
So they're one of those texture foods.

07:29.699 --> 07:32.702
-So, they've got that glutinous texture.
-Why would you request this?

07:33.327 --> 07:35.079
Well, I love this sort of thing by now.

07:35.163 --> 07:37.206
I'm a total convert
and I'm hoping to persuade you

07:37.290 --> 07:38.666
that you'll love them, too.

07:38.749 --> 07:40.626
Um, would you like to get
the worst bit over first

07:40.710 --> 07:42.462
and have your favorite food,
the sea cucumber?

07:42.545 --> 07:44.505
-[sighs]
-[laughs]

07:44.589 --> 07:46.549
Put aside all your prejudices,

07:46.632 --> 07:49.802
and just try to enjoy
that sort of soft rubberiness.

07:49.886 --> 07:51.220
[Chang sighs]

07:53.306 --> 07:54.348
[Dunlop] Mmm.

08:03.107 --> 08:06.486
-I don't mind the flavor of sea cucumber.
-[Dunlop] Yeah.

08:06.569 --> 08:07.945
[Chang] It's the texture.

08:09.155 --> 08:13.993
Texture or mouth feel, kou gan,
is so important in Chinese food

08:14.076 --> 08:17.205
and it's part of the whole pleasure
and experience of eating.

08:17.288 --> 08:21.125
A lot of the textures
that Chinese people really love,

08:21.209 --> 08:22.627
westerners don't like so much.

08:22.710 --> 08:26.422
Like slimy, slippery,
gristly, you know? [chuckles]

08:26.506 --> 08:30.635
Westerners tend to like the crispness
of deep-fried foods,

08:30.718 --> 08:32.845
but in China, there's a much bigger range
of textures.

08:32.929 --> 08:35.389
So, people coming here
for the first time,

08:35.472 --> 08:38.643
they're just completely outside your frame
of reference for textures, right?

08:38.726 --> 08:39.727
Like myself.

08:41.102 --> 08:44.315
And this is another kind of food
that's completely baffling to Westerners,

08:44.398 --> 08:47.151
because essentially
you just get dried tendons.

08:47.235 --> 08:51.155
Completely inedible,
and you have to laboriously soak them

08:51.239 --> 08:53.699
and fry them and braise them
to make them edible.

08:54.909 --> 08:58.120
I feel like a newb.

09:09.423 --> 09:12.510
-[chuckles]
-It's got a lot of chew.

09:14.345 --> 09:16.264
I don't think I can finish this.

09:16.347 --> 09:19.892
-Really? Do you want a napkin? [chuckles]
-Fuck.

09:21.978 --> 09:24.397
[in Mandarin]
I really like it, but he doesn't like it.

09:24.480 --> 09:25.898
[in English] I'm so sorry.
Can you tell him how sorry I am?

09:25.982 --> 09:29.652
[in Mandarin] He says he's really sorry,
and says he's not quite accustomed to it.

09:29.735 --> 09:33.656
I especially wanted him to eat it
because I think it's interesting.

09:34.282 --> 09:37.076
It's a good thing. He doesn't like it.

09:37.868 --> 09:40.746
[in English] If you're, uh, outside of
China trying to get into Chinese food,

09:40.830 --> 09:43.583
these texture foods are the last frontier.

09:43.666 --> 09:45.835
It took me years of eating in China,

09:46.460 --> 09:50.172
and politely eating all these
slithery, rubbery, gristly things,

09:50.256 --> 09:52.925
and not enjoying them,
to finally enjoy them.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.552
And now I really like them

09:54.635 --> 09:56.804
and I see that the texture
is part of the pleasure.

09:56.887 --> 10:01.684
This isn't bizarre.
It's just new to me. [chuckles]

10:01.767 --> 10:05.521
I'm reminded what it's like
to eat something for the first time

10:05.605 --> 10:07.898
and to be a foreigner to something.

10:10.610 --> 10:14.947
Spin the wheel. No whammies.

10:20.036 --> 10:22.913
[Ruth Reichl] I have always revered
Chinese food.

10:23.956 --> 10:29.337
And I thought it was time that New Yorkers
started to take it seriously.

10:30.838 --> 10:35.468
My predecessor at the Times
didn't think about anything

10:35.551 --> 10:39.221
but European restaurants
as being worthy of...

10:39.305 --> 10:41.307
And they made this
real distinction between

10:41.390 --> 10:45.353
the $25, the cheap eats column,
and the serious column.

10:45.436 --> 10:50.608
And I came here with a real intention
of changing that.

10:51.984 --> 10:54.987
[reading] "New York Noodletown,
with its bustle and clatter,

10:55.071 --> 10:58.115
its shared tables and its chefs
wreathed in billows of steam

10:58.199 --> 11:01.535
rising from the cauldrons of soup
in the front of the restaurant,

11:01.619 --> 11:04.872
is as close as you can get to Hong Kong
without leaving Manhattan.

11:05.706 --> 11:08.125
Cooks from southern China
are famous for their ability

11:08.209 --> 11:11.337
to bring out the essential nature
of each ingredient.

11:11.420 --> 11:15.007
This is a cuisine of simplicity
and inspired combination.

11:15.716 --> 11:17.385
Noodletown may seem modest,

11:17.468 --> 11:20.262
but notice how carefully
each vegetable has been cut,

11:20.346 --> 11:23.432
the way each piece of carrot,
each bit of green onion

11:23.516 --> 11:25.601
is exactly the same size.

11:25.684 --> 11:28.270
There is nothing casual
about this kitchen."

11:30.106 --> 11:32.233
I want them to feel like
when they finished reading the review,

11:32.316 --> 11:34.151
they've been at the restaurant.

11:34.235 --> 11:39.448
A good critic gives the reader
a better way to experience it.

11:39.532 --> 11:44.453
Being able to introduce people to
something that you know is fantastic,

11:44.537 --> 11:47.790
that they've never tasted before,
it's just a joy.

11:50.709 --> 11:54.296
I'm in this business for 45 years,
I've eaten a lot of great stuff,

11:54.380 --> 11:57.591
I go to Hong Kong a lot,
and when you start studying Chinese food,

11:57.675 --> 12:01.429
you realize that Chinese food is probably
the most sophisticated food on the planet.

12:01.512 --> 12:04.849
Where's Chinese food's place
in the world of cuisine?

12:04.932 --> 12:08.227
-Joe's skill is spectacular.
-[Yang] He's out there, man.

12:08.310 --> 12:10.146
[Schoenfeld] He can make dumplings
that look like animals.

12:10.229 --> 12:14.608
And they all taste delicious.
It doesn't get the credit it deserves.

12:14.692 --> 12:19.196
Let's just say look at Italian food,
40, 50 years ago.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.615
Now, everyone knows about Italian food,
for the most part.

12:21.699 --> 12:24.869
They know types of pasta names.
It's crazy to me.

12:24.952 --> 12:27.163
Do you think that in 20, 30 years,

12:27.246 --> 12:31.959
that the Gen Y generation
will know more about Chinese food

12:32.042 --> 12:33.461
than anyone else, and they won't...

12:33.544 --> 12:36.547
When they go to China, they're gonna be
like, "Oh, this is exactly what I wanted."

12:36.630 --> 12:37.465
I think you're right.

12:37.548 --> 12:40.217
We have regional Italian restaurants
in New York now.

12:40.301 --> 12:44.263
I think, in 20 years, people might know
the difference between Yunnan and Hunan.

12:44.346 --> 12:45.973
You guys are so optimistic.

12:46.056 --> 12:49.185
That's the thing, but Italians are white,
so, come on.

12:49.268 --> 12:52.605
A lot of the regionality still happens
in urban areas.

12:52.688 --> 12:54.064
-[Yang] It's true.
-LA, New York.

12:54.148 --> 12:57.902
You don't have this variety
in, necessarily, the Midwest

12:57.985 --> 13:00.279
or the South, where there aren't just
as many Chinese immigrants.

13:00.362 --> 13:03.324
So, if I'm interested in food,
I'm living in suburban Knoxville,

13:03.407 --> 13:06.827
the truth is I only have maybe one,
two Chinese restaurants

13:06.911 --> 13:08.913
that are available to me to try.

13:08.996 --> 13:12.291
And the truth is, Italians have very much
assimilated into culture.

13:12.374 --> 13:16.420
And then there's still that block for
Chinese-Americans because we're not white.

13:30.184 --> 13:31.727
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

13:31.810 --> 13:33.229
-Good to see you.
-Good to see you.

13:34.772 --> 13:36.732
[Dai] When did you first move here?

13:36.815 --> 13:38.067
[Ren] 1992.

13:38.150 --> 13:40.528
-Why did you come here?
-Because my family is here.

13:40.611 --> 13:43.322
My wife was UT student before.

13:43.405 --> 13:44.698
Oh, okay, okay.

13:44.782 --> 13:48.118
[in Mandarin] When you first came,
were there many Chinese people?

13:48.202 --> 13:50.788
There were some, not that many.

13:50.871 --> 13:53.874
-These are the things you like to eat.
-[in English] Well, yeah.

13:53.958 --> 13:56.627
Because, uh, I come
from Chongqing, Sichuan.

13:56.710 --> 13:59.171
-Mmm.
-All gentlemen...

13:59.838 --> 14:00.714
can cook.

14:05.928 --> 14:08.639
[Dai in Mandarin]
But your own food here isn't Sichuanese.

14:08.722 --> 14:13.227
[Ren in English] No, no, no.
This is all American Chinese.

14:13.310 --> 14:14.436
[Dai] American Chinese?

14:14.520 --> 14:17.940
[Ren] Yeah. If I make 100% Chinese...

14:18.607 --> 14:19.900
-No business.
-[laughs]

14:21.277 --> 14:23.112
My mom said when she came here,

14:23.195 --> 14:25.406
she would call you first
so that you could make her...

14:25.489 --> 14:27.825
'Cause my mom loves spicy food
and Sichuan food,

14:27.908 --> 14:29.910
so she said she would call you
and you'd have to make stuff.

14:29.994 --> 14:30.828
That's right.

14:30.911 --> 14:32.204
Do they just have to call ahead?

14:32.288 --> 14:36.667
Because here, 98% is American people.

14:36.750 --> 14:38.752
-Just a few Chinese.
-Mmm-hmm.

14:38.836 --> 14:43.716
If some Chinese want Chinese food,
of course I have to do it.

14:43.799 --> 14:48.429
But I cannot prepare all the Chinese food
for waiting Chinese come in.

14:48.512 --> 14:49.513
-Right?
-Yeah.

14:49.597 --> 14:54.393
So, them have to call first,
then I prepare.

14:54.476 --> 14:56.520
I don't have a Chinese menu.

14:56.604 --> 14:59.899
Because if I got a Chinese menu,
I cannot go away.

14:59.982 --> 15:02.818
-[Ren] I'd have to cook all the time.
-[Dai] Yeah. [chuckles]

15:03.611 --> 15:06.280
[Dai] How do Americans who know
that you're cooking, how do they find out?

15:06.363 --> 15:10.534
[Ren] Now, sometimes them come
in here eat and...

15:10.618 --> 15:12.328
Chinese eat here, too.

15:12.411 --> 15:15.205
-Them say, "Oh, what's that? What's that?"
-[laughs]

15:15.289 --> 15:16.665
Then next time, got a special.

15:17.374 --> 15:19.585
-[Dai] I see.
-[Ren] Serve it like that.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.926
[Lee] About 90% of Chinese
restaurant workers in America now

15:27.009 --> 15:30.638
come from one region of China
called Fuzhou.

15:31.388 --> 15:35.517
It's really interesting going there,
'cause many towns are ghost towns.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.519
There are no men of working age.

15:37.603 --> 15:41.398
So many of the people there go to America
to work in restaurants.

15:41.482 --> 15:43.359
They actually have
English language schools

15:43.442 --> 15:45.945
that specifically teach
restaurant English.

15:46.028 --> 15:48.447
Words like "zucchini," "French fries."

15:49.031 --> 15:53.077
And the teacher says,
"You must say 'fried rice.'

15:53.160 --> 15:56.080
Do not say, 'flied lice.'"

15:57.331 --> 16:02.169
It's a very practical way of responding
to the economic forces

16:02.252 --> 16:05.214
that are pulling those people
to the United States.

16:13.889 --> 16:16.976
[Brandon Jew] When the immigrants
first came here, they set up shop.

16:17.059 --> 16:19.311
They were a successful community.

16:20.312 --> 16:23.399
We're sandwiched between
two very iconic restaurants.

16:23.482 --> 16:27.611
Unfortunately, they both closed.
Um, this one right here, Kan's.

16:27.695 --> 16:29.321
The chef was Johnny Kan.

16:29.405 --> 16:32.491
He was the one that introduced
the lazy Susan to Americans.

16:32.574 --> 16:33.867
That happened there.

16:33.951 --> 16:37.579
The Empress of China,
that is like a dream restaurant.

16:37.663 --> 16:40.165
When I went in there for the first time,
I was like, "This is amazing."

16:40.249 --> 16:44.169
Massive chandeliers,
fully adorned dining room.

16:44.253 --> 16:47.339
People came here
for a fancy banquet dinner.

16:47.423 --> 16:50.426
This has been part of the nightlife
of San Francisco for a long time.

16:52.094 --> 16:55.389
Having the experience of being
a third-generation Chinese-American,

16:55.472 --> 16:58.350
being exposed to
a lot of different things,

16:58.434 --> 17:00.394
I cooked Italian food
before I cooked Chinese food.

17:00.477 --> 17:03.856
I believe in small,
organic local farms, seasonality,

17:03.939 --> 17:07.901
all these things that came out of a lot
of my training in California cuisine.

17:08.484 --> 17:12.321
When I first thought of fried rice,
I thought of how my mom used to make it.

17:13.781 --> 17:15.909
We would eat a steak restaurant

17:15.992 --> 17:17.578
and she would have
a bunch of steak left over.

17:17.661 --> 17:20.079
So this is wagyu sirloin.

17:21.330 --> 17:22.583
We'll hit this.

17:22.665 --> 17:24.752
We're just trying to melt
some of the fat off of it

17:24.835 --> 17:27.503
and use it as a base for our rice.

17:27.588 --> 17:30.257
One of the most classic combinations
of Chinese-American food

17:30.340 --> 17:31.300
is beef and broccoli,

17:31.383 --> 17:33.510
so, this is some Italian variety
of broccoli,

17:33.594 --> 17:35.637
and this is rice that's been dried out
for two or three days,

17:35.721 --> 17:37.639
and then just some egg.

17:37.723 --> 17:40.392
There's some food that
isn't meant to be tweezered.

17:41.226 --> 17:44.438
This food is about being delicious.

17:44.521 --> 17:48.275
For me, this is about trying to speak to
Chinese-Americans

17:48.358 --> 17:53.530
that want to feel a sense of pride
in Chinese food again.

17:56.158 --> 17:57.534
Mmm-hmm.

18:02.247 --> 18:04.166
[Yang] So, I think when you're a kid
growing up American,

18:04.249 --> 18:06.335
you're trying to be American,
you're trying to assimilate.

18:06.418 --> 18:08.462
Where I grew up,
there weren't a ton of Asian people.

18:08.545 --> 18:10.631
In my high school,
a large percentage was Latino.

18:10.714 --> 18:13.675
We had black kids,
white kids, not a ton of Asians.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.969
So, I was trying to fit in
with other kinds of people.

18:16.053 --> 18:18.514
It wasn't like,
"Let me learn the difference between Hunan

18:18.597 --> 18:21.391
and Shanghainese
and Cantonese cuisine."

18:21.475 --> 18:23.519
-You were looking inside.
-Yeah.

18:23.602 --> 18:25.938
I was learning
about carne asada, man.

18:26.021 --> 18:28.774
Chinese restaurants
have many different levels.

18:28.857 --> 18:31.610
A really high class, a really low class.

18:31.693 --> 18:32.861
But people don't know that.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.906
People don't know that there's
royal, grand, banquet cuisine in China.

18:35.989 --> 18:37.908
[Ng] All the restaurants
almost sell the same thing.

18:37.991 --> 18:39.284
So you can't compare

18:39.368 --> 18:41.954
which one is the high level,
which one is the low level.

18:42.037 --> 18:46.875
To me, again, the giant, 1,000 pound
gorilla in the room is racism

18:46.959 --> 18:49.711
-in Chinese food, right?
-Exactly. [laughing]

18:49.795 --> 18:53.173
And why I get upset
about how it's perceived

18:53.257 --> 18:55.467
is that it's always seen
as somewhat inferior,

18:55.551 --> 18:57.553
or I always think about,
just looking about service,

18:57.636 --> 18:58.929
-the lazy Susan, to me, is genius.
-[Yang] Yeah.

18:59.012 --> 19:02.015
Asian restaurant service, where it's curt,

19:02.099 --> 19:05.185
it's very efficient,
but there's no niceties, really.

19:05.269 --> 19:07.646
The more rude you are,
the better service you're gonna get.

19:07.729 --> 19:11.108
-It's legitimately a cultural difference.
-[Dai] Right.

19:11.191 --> 19:13.735
People think
that's terrible service, right?

19:13.819 --> 19:14.736
Yeah.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.905
And that's, to me, where it starts.

19:19.908 --> 19:23.495
Last time I was here,
it was insanely crowded.

19:24.663 --> 19:27.166
-We had to fight for a table.
-[Gillian Ferguson] Uh-huh.

19:27.249 --> 19:28.792
[Chang] I don't even know how I got here.

19:28.876 --> 19:31.879
I didn't even know
it was in the San Gabriel Valley,

19:31.962 --> 19:34.214
so I'm happy to be back.

19:35.090 --> 19:38.093
I have only been here once before
and I had no idea what I was doing.

19:38.177 --> 19:41.013
I ordered three things because
I read Jonathan Gold's review,

19:41.096 --> 19:42.890
and I was like,
"All right. You gotta get the lobster."

19:43.765 --> 19:45.893
If I come in here, where do I start?

19:45.976 --> 19:47.102
[Chang] The first thing is,

19:47.186 --> 19:51.064
Chinese restaurant packed with
Chinese people is a good sign.

19:54.443 --> 19:55.861
Is this your local spot?

19:55.944 --> 19:57.571
[woman] Yeah, his local spot.

19:57.654 --> 19:59.656
-[Chang] Wendy, you hungry?
-A little bit.

19:59.740 --> 20:00.824
[Chang] Come on, sit down.

20:00.908 --> 20:02.034
-This is a cold starter?
-[Lam] Yeah.

20:02.117 --> 20:04.244
-[Chang] This isn't on the menu, right?
-[Lam] Not on the menu...

20:04.328 --> 20:06.288
That's what I'm trying to get at.

20:06.371 --> 20:08.498
-There's all this secret stuff.
-[Lam] Oh, yes.

20:08.582 --> 20:10.918
[Chang] Pro tip.
There's always a secret menu.

20:12.085 --> 20:16.089
I know that you have
secret ways to cook lobster.

20:17.090 --> 20:19.760
You just have to badger them
to the point where it's like,

20:19.843 --> 20:22.304
"I'm just gonna give you something
so you leave us alone."

20:22.387 --> 20:25.474
The peanut, um, what is it?
Uh, with the soy sauce?

20:25.557 --> 20:27.768
-Can we try that, too? How do I know?
-Yes.

20:27.851 --> 20:30.520
This is a lot of work
to get to the real menu.

20:30.604 --> 20:33.774
[Chang] There's no way you can do this
without being an obnoxious...

20:33.857 --> 20:34.775
[donkey brays]

20:34.858 --> 20:37.653
-We never cook that.
-Oh, that's not true. Come on.

20:37.736 --> 20:40.739
Whoever's peacocking the largest
is gonna get the attention.

20:40.822 --> 20:43.992
What kind of, uh, rice or noodle
should we finish with?

20:44.076 --> 20:47.496
Oh, I have one secret fried rice. Yeah!

20:47.579 --> 20:50.916
[Chang] If you order well,
it's like Morse Code to the kitchen.

20:50.999 --> 20:53.919
Whenever you go to a place like this,
you go straight to the fish tank.

20:56.213 --> 21:00.342
-Whoa, whoa. Oh, my God. It's prehistoric.
-[Chang laughing]

21:01.260 --> 21:03.512
And this would feed
how many people?

21:04.179 --> 21:05.597
Easy. Eight, ten.

21:07.557 --> 21:09.226
That is unbelievably good.

21:11.019 --> 21:12.187
-[Ferguson] Oh, my God.
-[Chang] Oh, shit.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.981
[waiter] That is your fried rice.

21:15.565 --> 21:18.777
[Ferguson] I can't wait to come back,
and now I know how to order.

21:18.860 --> 21:20.195
-[Chang] This is a lot of food.
-[chuckles]

21:20.279 --> 21:23.031
It's a good idea to come with people.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.616
A lot of people.

21:27.369 --> 21:29.871
[Reichl] Now there's a lot
of money in China.

21:29.955 --> 21:32.708
There's true respect for Chinese food.

21:32.791 --> 21:36.044
Why would a great Chinese chef
come to America,

21:36.128 --> 21:39.965
where everybody thinks
that Chinese food is supposed to be cheap

21:40.048 --> 21:42.968
and they don't really respect it?

21:43.051 --> 21:44.886
If you want great Chinese food,

21:44.970 --> 21:49.891
you are probably not gonna get it
in America unless you go to Las Vegas,

21:49.975 --> 21:53.937
where they attract a Chinese audience
by getting great chefs there.

21:57.399 --> 22:00.110
[Gary Selesner] In recent years,
there has been a change

22:00.193 --> 22:02.696
and now the Chinese middle class
is traveling the world.

22:02.779 --> 22:05.490
They're the number one tourists
in the world.

22:05.574 --> 22:08.869
They're certainly the number one
foreign tourists in Las Vegas.

22:11.413 --> 22:14.875
[Chang] So 20 years ago, it would be hard
to see this kind of restaurant open.

22:14.958 --> 22:20.505
The key to this restaurant has always
been, from day one, authenticity.

22:20.589 --> 22:25.302
In the past year, we have been
very, very lucky and successful

22:25.385 --> 22:28.680
in adding to our Asian culinary talent.

22:28.764 --> 22:32.601
We have, uh, Chef Yu,
and he is from Beijing,

22:32.684 --> 22:35.812
and he is a master
of northern Chinese food.

22:37.105 --> 22:39.149
-Ah. Look at this.
-What is this?

22:39.232 --> 22:42.569
[Selesner] This is hand-stretched noodles

22:42.652 --> 22:45.989
like you would get
in Shandong province, China.

22:46.073 --> 22:51.036
And then there's a mixture there of tomato
and kind of like a scrambled egg.

22:51.119 --> 22:52.829
This is so good.

22:52.913 --> 22:55.499
-[waitress] Fried sea fish.
-[Chang] Wow!

22:56.208 --> 23:00.504
I'm so happy to be here right now.
My God, this food is bonkers.

23:00.587 --> 23:02.964
[Selesner] This is a fish.

23:03.048 --> 23:06.718
This preparation
comes from Chengdu, China.

23:06.802 --> 23:09.721
So this is a Sichuanese fish.

23:09.805 --> 23:14.184
This is a sensation that I don't think
ten years ago you could get in America.

23:14.267 --> 23:17.229
I love this. This is also
one of my favorite dishes to eat.

23:17.312 --> 23:19.815
This is as good as you can get
in America.

23:20.732 --> 23:23.777
Usually, I'm not a huge fan
of having it super authentic,

23:23.860 --> 23:26.863
but I think for Chinese food,
since it really hasn't been done...

23:26.947 --> 23:27.781
[Selesner] Yep.

23:27.864 --> 23:30.367
...you actually want it authentic
so you actually have a reference point.

23:30.450 --> 23:31.451
[Selesner] Exactly.

23:31.535 --> 23:32.953
[Chang] How many times
do you get customers

23:33.036 --> 23:35.872
that just want traditional
Chinese-American dishes?

23:35.956 --> 23:38.667
[Selesner] What we could serve here
10, 11 years ago,

23:38.750 --> 23:42.212
and what we now can serve
to a convention here,

23:42.295 --> 23:45.215
and they will appreciate,
is two different things.

23:45.298 --> 23:49.594
The climate for acceptance of
this type of food has never been higher.

23:49.678 --> 23:51.721
-[Chang] Hi, Chef.
-[Selesner] This is Chef Su.

23:51.805 --> 23:53.348
-How are you?
-Very good.

23:53.431 --> 23:57.727
Born in Guangdong, and then
grew up, uh, cooking in Hong Kong.

23:57.811 --> 24:01.356
Chef Su's probably been here
eight, nine years at this point.

24:01.439 --> 24:03.567
Chef, this is so good.

24:11.658 --> 24:15.287
"Fortune cookies are not native to China.
They're from California."

24:15.370 --> 24:16.288
True.

24:21.209 --> 24:24.045
"The Chinese takeout box
is completely American.

24:25.505 --> 24:28.091
It was originally designed
for shucked oysters."

24:29.509 --> 24:32.888
"China uses 45 billion
pairs of chopsticks a year."

24:34.931 --> 24:36.683
[woman] "Chinese food's five key flavors

24:36.766 --> 24:39.811
are balanced according
to traditional Chinese medicine."

24:40.645 --> 24:43.815
"You want gluten-free? Go fuck yourself."

24:44.649 --> 24:45.692
[laughs]

24:47.611 --> 24:50.197
"I am a Nigerian prince.
Please send money."

24:50.864 --> 24:53.617
"Why don't these things have emojis?"
[chuckles]

24:58.205 --> 25:00.540
"And the winner is La La Land."

25:04.502 --> 25:06.671
"This is a racist scam.
You should stop."

25:07.839 --> 25:08.757
[grunts]

25:08.840 --> 25:11.885
"Fortune cookies are fake news. Sad."

25:22.145 --> 25:27.150
In every town, basically, in America,
but specifically in the South,

25:27.234 --> 25:29.444
it's a little bit surprising
to find Chinese food.

25:29.527 --> 25:34.157
Yes, well, there is actually a solid
Chinese community here I grew up with.

25:34.241 --> 25:37.244
Did you ever grow up thinking,
"Why am I Chinese?"

25:37.327 --> 25:39.204
All the time. Of course! [chuckles]

25:39.287 --> 25:41.039
Did you grow up and think,
"Why am I Korean?"

25:41.122 --> 25:43.416
Yeah. I was like, "Man, this sucks."

25:43.500 --> 25:44.751
Yeah. Yeah.

25:44.834 --> 25:50.131
And I was always like,
"Man, I wish I was just white,"

25:50.215 --> 25:54.427
because of acceptance and culture,
but also acceptance of the food,

25:54.511 --> 25:56.388
because there was so much more to explain.

25:56.471 --> 25:58.765
If you hung out
with a lot of white people,

25:58.848 --> 26:03.061
you tried not to eat
Chinese food or Korean food...

26:03.144 --> 26:04.479
-[Dai laughs] Around them.
-...around white people.

26:04.562 --> 26:05.438
[Dai] Yeah, yeah.

26:05.522 --> 26:06.648
[Chang] You hungry?

26:06.731 --> 26:09.359
-Join us.
-Uh... Yeah, why not.

26:09.442 --> 26:13.363
I don't believe anything you say
unless you start eating this food.

26:13.446 --> 26:15.782
-Okay, then let's try, then.
-[all laughing]

26:15.865 --> 26:17.701
But I'm truly hungry.

26:17.784 --> 26:18.994
Oh.

26:19.828 --> 26:21.079
Yes, I eat here.

26:21.162 --> 26:23.665
And I've tried every single one of them.

26:25.709 --> 26:29.087
I can tell... I like every one.

26:29.170 --> 26:31.131
-[Chang] Is this intestine?
-[Dai] Yes.

26:31.214 --> 26:32.215
[Sang] Mmm. Intestine.

26:33.091 --> 26:34.926
See, this is what my parents did.

26:35.010 --> 26:37.137
They serve it to me
and they don't tell me what it is.

26:37.220 --> 26:40.056
And then I start liking it,
and then they tell me...

26:42.225 --> 26:43.226
How'd it taste?

26:45.061 --> 26:47.314
-It tastes like intestines. [laughs]
-Well...

26:47.397 --> 26:51.484
-[Dai] What does intestine taste like?
-What I imagined. What I just tasted.

26:51.568 --> 26:53.987
You're telling me that people order this?

26:54.070 --> 26:55.905
-[Sang] A lot. Yes.
-A lot?

26:55.989 --> 27:00.201
I can tell you we do stuff with more
intestines than our gourmet noodles.

27:00.285 --> 27:01.411
-What?
-[Dai] Really?

27:01.494 --> 27:04.581
-Yeah. No, I'm not lying.
-[Chang] I know you're not lying.

27:04.664 --> 27:07.917
Me, dummy me, had the preconceived idea

27:08.001 --> 27:13.256
that the top five things here would be
egg rolls, lo mein, fried rice,

27:13.340 --> 27:15.592
-General Tso's chicken.
-Right, right.

27:15.675 --> 27:17.385
-It's not?
-No, it's not.

27:17.469 --> 27:18.470
Well...

27:18.553 --> 27:20.388
If that's what you're looking for,
you're in the wrong place.

27:20.472 --> 27:21.639
[Dai and Sang chuckle]

27:21.723 --> 27:23.683
Right? Well, I think
I have to go back to work now.

27:23.767 --> 27:26.353
-Okay. Thank you.
-Okay.

27:26.978 --> 27:28.897
I wanna believe him, I really do.

27:28.980 --> 27:32.108
I'm shocked, honestly.
Maybe we don't give people enough credit.

27:32.192 --> 27:33.443
-No, no, no, no.
-No?

27:33.526 --> 27:36.363
-We give people too much credit.
-[laughing]

27:37.530 --> 27:38.531
[Dai] I don't know.

27:42.619 --> 27:45.497
[Ng] A lot of people still think,
American-Chinese food,

27:45.580 --> 27:47.499
all they have are egg roll,
fried chicken wing,

27:47.582 --> 27:48.875
yellow rice, right now,

27:48.958 --> 27:50.919
I don't know
where they come from.

27:51.002 --> 27:55.131
I think we're spoiled, man.
Yeah, we're in these big urban areas.

27:55.215 --> 27:58.176
We're in big cities and we have all
of these different Chinese options,

27:58.259 --> 28:02.514
but for people in smaller towns,
there's one Chinese place in town,

28:02.597 --> 28:06.267
and a lot of times
that one place is a Panda Express.

28:06.351 --> 28:07.894
Here's a weird story.

28:07.977 --> 28:09.521
There's a basketball player
named Kevin Durant,

28:09.604 --> 28:12.774
one of the greatest players in the world,
and he used to play in Oklahoma City.

28:12.857 --> 28:14.943
-[crowd cheering]
-[commentator] Back out. Durant for three!

28:16.569 --> 28:19.864
[Yang] Last year, he signed with
the Golden State Warriors as a free agent.

28:19.948 --> 28:22.826
So he went on the Warriors' Reddit,
and said,

28:22.909 --> 28:26.496
"Hey, man, I'm new in the Bay Area.
Where should I go?"

28:26.579 --> 28:30.125
And one of the people on Reddit said,
"You should try boba."

28:30.208 --> 28:31.334
He's like, "What's that?"

28:31.418 --> 28:32.544
And the person explained to him,

28:32.627 --> 28:35.547
it was this tapioca milk tea
with these little balls in it.

28:35.630 --> 28:39.634
Kevin Durant is exposed to a lot of stuff,
but even he hasn't had boba,

28:39.718 --> 28:42.011
which to us is a thing
that's been around in LA,

28:42.095 --> 28:43.722
-it's been in New York for decades.
-[Dai] Yeah.

28:43.805 --> 28:44.931
The next day,

28:45.014 --> 28:48.601
he posts a picture of himself
holding a boba tea on that Reddit.

28:48.685 --> 28:50.478
[Dai] That's amazing.

28:50.562 --> 28:52.814
In a different context, there weren't
many Jewish people in my town,

28:52.897 --> 28:54.232
so I didn't have, like, a smoked fish

28:54.315 --> 28:56.109
-until I moved to New York.
-Same with me.

28:56.192 --> 28:57.694
So, it's just a matter
of who you are living around.

28:57.777 --> 29:01.030
Growing up, I went to this restaurant
called Wu's Garden,

29:01.114 --> 29:04.617
and this is a perfect example
of immigrants.

29:04.701 --> 29:06.035
They came from the Shandong province.

29:06.119 --> 29:08.788
It was an iconic restaurant
for my family

29:08.872 --> 29:10.749
and people that lived
in this Virginia area,

29:10.832 --> 29:12.542
-and then it shut down.
-[Yang] Yeah.

29:12.625 --> 29:14.753
Because the kids
didn't wanna take it over.

29:14.836 --> 29:16.755
I'm sure their parents
didn't want them to take it over.

29:16.838 --> 29:18.923
[Chang] Well, that's the thing.

29:19.007 --> 29:21.760
You work hard in the business,
you want your kids to have a better life,

29:21.843 --> 29:24.763
you want them to become a doctor
or a lawyer or an Indian chief.

29:24.846 --> 29:29.017
But now you're seeing a second generation
of Asian-American kids

29:29.100 --> 29:31.394
that are like,
"No, I want to do it."

29:40.153 --> 29:41.654
[Kris Yenbamroong]
We're gonna do some fried rice.

29:41.738 --> 29:43.615
Are you gonna make one, too?

29:43.698 --> 29:46.075
-I can make one, but I'd rather...
-Okay.

29:46.159 --> 29:48.119
-I'm in your home.
-Yeah.

29:48.203 --> 29:52.791
It's always two eggs.
A little onion. There's garlic.

29:52.874 --> 29:56.377
[Chang] Do you prefer old rice,
or it doesn't matter? Fresh rice...

29:56.461 --> 29:58.922
Old rice is always preferable.

29:59.005 --> 30:01.216
Like rice out of a deli container
in the fridge.

30:01.299 --> 30:03.218
[Chang] A little bit dried out.

30:03.301 --> 30:06.095
So, at this point,
I'm gonna put in the rice,

30:06.179 --> 30:08.640
and then I follow it
immediately with sugar.

30:08.723 --> 30:12.185
White sugar is something that
surprises a lot of people.

30:12.268 --> 30:16.648
Just how much goes into
any sort of Thai stir fry dish,

30:16.731 --> 30:17.899
or Thai-Chinese stir fry dish.

30:17.982 --> 30:23.112
I like to get it kind of almost burned,
kind of get it really smoky.

30:23.738 --> 30:28.618
And then just at the end now,
we're gonna put in some crab.

30:28.701 --> 30:32.163
Cuisine of Thailand is so different
than anything else, I think, in Asia.

30:32.914 --> 30:34.874
-Yeah.
-How would you explain the difference?

30:34.958 --> 30:37.085
There's fried rice.
People are using a wok...

30:37.168 --> 30:39.546
I think the seasoning
is the main thing.

30:39.629 --> 30:41.506
It's sort of the combination.

30:41.589 --> 30:44.884
Balance is something that people
talk about with Thai food.

30:44.968 --> 30:48.388
But that balance can mean different things
for different dishes.

30:48.471 --> 30:50.974
If it's fried rice,
even the worst version,

30:51.057 --> 30:53.476
-I think is kind of good, so...
-Right.

30:56.980 --> 30:57.981
I'm so excited.

31:02.318 --> 31:05.697
What really interests me
is how things get passed down.

31:05.780 --> 31:08.074
My dad was in the restaurant business,
wasn't a Korean,

31:08.157 --> 31:09.742
and he based his entire life
to make sure

31:09.826 --> 31:11.744
I was never gonna be
in the restaurant business.

31:12.704 --> 31:15.373
All the restaurants that I would go to,
they're all closed now

31:15.456 --> 31:18.960
because their kids are doing other stuff.

31:19.043 --> 31:21.170
They're like bankers
and lawyers and shit like that.

31:21.254 --> 31:24.757
[Yenbamroong] Yeah, yeah.
My parents opened up Talésai in 1982.

31:24.841 --> 31:26.259
That's the year I was born.

31:26.342 --> 31:28.428
My grandma was the original chef here.

31:28.511 --> 31:31.055
It was all black and white,
'80s minimalist.

31:31.139 --> 31:33.892
I moved back here from New York
in 2008 and took over,

31:33.975 --> 31:36.185
and had all these ideas for it.

31:36.269 --> 31:39.022
I had never run a restaurant.
I didn't know anything about business.

31:39.105 --> 31:42.650
I quickly got my ass handed to me.
It was really brutal.

31:42.734 --> 31:45.194
Now, my dad, who built the restaurant,

31:45.278 --> 31:47.780
he was watching it slowly...
You know?

31:47.864 --> 31:51.326
Everyone else, like my grandma,
everyone who was involved

31:51.409 --> 31:53.119
were like, "You gotta kick Kris out."

31:53.202 --> 31:55.955
No one was coming,
no new customers.

31:58.249 --> 32:01.044
I would literally get death threats.
People would come in and be like,

32:01.127 --> 32:02.921
"It's you, right? You're the fucker."

32:03.004 --> 32:06.215
Was there a breaking point
with your parents and family

32:06.299 --> 32:07.425
where they're like,

32:07.508 --> 32:09.969
"This is the last straw, Kris.
You can't do this anymore"?

32:10.053 --> 32:13.222
Or they trusted you
to push through this?

32:13.306 --> 32:15.892
Because, obviously, you've expanded.

32:15.975 --> 32:16.809
Yeah.

32:16.893 --> 32:20.146
Your restaurant group now
is killing it.

32:20.229 --> 32:22.190
What was the turning point there?

32:22.273 --> 32:24.442
I thought,
"It can't get any worse.

32:24.525 --> 32:27.028
I've already experienced
the worst of the worst.

32:27.111 --> 32:29.238
So, why don't I just give it a go?"

32:30.615 --> 32:33.868
It's funny, 'cause the food
we started serving in 2010,

32:33.952 --> 32:36.245
when we opened Night + Market...

32:36.329 --> 32:38.790
This is honestly the stuff
that my parents

32:38.873 --> 32:41.292
would probably wanna eat, too.
You know?

32:41.376 --> 32:43.670
They felt like,
"We might wanna eat it

32:43.753 --> 32:46.714
between lunch and dinner service
in the back,

32:46.798 --> 32:48.716
but is anyone else gonna wanna eat it?"

32:48.800 --> 32:50.969
You know, like,
"Whities aren't gonna like that.

32:51.052 --> 32:55.139
It stinks to high heaven.
We gotta air it out."

32:55.223 --> 32:59.143
So, the food you're making now
in the renaissance of the restaurant

32:59.227 --> 33:02.313
really was what your grandmother
made and--

33:02.397 --> 33:04.357
It was like staff meal food.

33:04.440 --> 33:05.733
-You know what I mean?
-That's the best stuff.

33:05.817 --> 33:08.945
[Yenbamroong] That's essentially
what it was. It wasn't thought out,

33:09.028 --> 33:11.489
it was like,
"Let's put this out there."

33:11.572 --> 33:13.366
I think it's good and tasty.

33:13.449 --> 33:15.952
Maybe other people
are gonna like it, too.

33:16.035 --> 33:19.122
Finally, I felt
like I had something to offer.

33:19.205 --> 33:21.207
Finally, I felt like I could do something.

33:32.343 --> 33:34.762
[Dunlop] I don't think
there's any other culture

33:34.846 --> 33:37.432
that's as food-obsessed as the Chinese.

33:38.349 --> 33:40.643
Right at the heart of Chinese culture,

33:40.727 --> 33:43.813
food was the way you communicated
with your gods and ancestors

33:43.896 --> 33:46.065
by making edible offerings.

33:46.149 --> 33:48.860
So people in China
are absolutely obsessed with food,

33:48.943 --> 33:54.198
and it goes right from sort of
imperial cooking, fancy banquet food,

33:54.282 --> 33:56.242
down to farmhouse cooking,

33:56.325 --> 33:58.327
street food, fermentation,
all these things.

33:58.411 --> 34:00.580
China just has it all.

34:00.663 --> 34:04.417
Would you say that the food
that most of America and western Europe

34:04.500 --> 34:07.336
thinks of as Chinese food
is Chinese food at all?

34:07.420 --> 34:09.880
Because Chinese was one of the earliest
immigrant cuisines,

34:09.964 --> 34:13.051
I think it adapted to American
and also British taste

34:13.134 --> 34:15.636
at a time when people
were maybe less cosmopolitan.

34:15.719 --> 34:18.473
And they came out with a formula
which kind of worked.

34:19.474 --> 34:22.560
But since then, everyone's
got more globalized in their taste,

34:22.643 --> 34:24.062
certainly in big cities.

34:25.103 --> 34:27.065
Often for Chinese waiting staff,

34:27.148 --> 34:30.735
it's difficult to explain the food
to people who don't speak Chinese.

34:30.818 --> 34:35.322
And so I think it's just kind of easiest
to give people sweet and sour pork,

34:35.406 --> 34:36.866
a General Tso's chicken,

34:36.949 --> 34:40.953
and the things that have a track record
and everyone knows and loves.

34:41.036 --> 34:44.706
It's more complicated selling
more interesting Chinese dishes.

34:48.418 --> 34:50.630
[Dai] I've met people before
who have said,

34:50.713 --> 34:53.049
"I don't like Chinese food, and I
don't know if I can hang out with you."

34:53.132 --> 34:55.301
But I've also just seen around
people saying online,

34:55.384 --> 34:57.470
on Twitter, whatever, reviews,

34:57.553 --> 34:59.388
"I'm scared of Indian food,
I'm scared of Chinese food."

34:59.472 --> 35:03.309
When someone says that, I just think,
"What are you scared of?

35:03.392 --> 35:06.020
Are you scared of a pork rib
or a dumpling?

35:06.104 --> 35:08.523
And is it really about the food
or are you just scared of the people?"

35:08.606 --> 35:11.734
There are some pretty vile things
associated with food

35:11.818 --> 35:13.986
that no one ever wants to talk about.

35:14.070 --> 35:18.533
Last year, you wrote a piece about
Kings County Restaurant.

35:18.616 --> 35:19.951
Kings County Imperial in Brooklyn.

35:20.034 --> 35:23.079
This website did a review
of a Chinese restaurant.

35:23.162 --> 35:24.413
The chef happens to be white.

35:24.497 --> 35:26.874
They were saying that
the food was really good,

35:26.958 --> 35:29.627
but there are different options if you
wanna eat Chinese food in New York

35:29.710 --> 35:33.214
and it's either you get gross
and dirty in Chinatown,

35:33.297 --> 35:36.968
or go to Mission Chinese.
And then they proceeded to declare

35:37.051 --> 35:40.388
that this was the best Chinese restaurant
in New York City.

35:40.471 --> 35:42.515
And this dichotomy, like,

35:42.598 --> 35:46.102
"We love Chinese food and Chinese food
is great, but it's dirty and gross,

35:46.185 --> 35:47.728
unless a white person cooks it."

35:47.812 --> 35:51.232
It's these old ideas
of Chinese people being dirty,

35:51.315 --> 35:55.153
and Chinese food being gross,
and not acceptable, and not "clean."

35:55.236 --> 35:58.823
I tweeted something like,
"This is an incredibly racist review."

35:58.906 --> 36:03.578
And people started asking me,
"Why is this... I just don't understand."

36:03.661 --> 36:05.955
Why? 'Cause they just didn't see
the same thing that I saw.

36:07.331 --> 36:10.459
[Schoenfeld] The history of Chinese food
in America goes back to the 1850s

36:10.543 --> 36:12.170
and Chinese people emigrating here,

36:12.253 --> 36:15.089
and not occupying
a very high place in society.

36:16.757 --> 36:19.927
[Lee] When the Chinese first came
to American shores,

36:20.011 --> 36:22.096
they just took normal labor jobs.

36:22.180 --> 36:25.892
It was agriculture, mining,
railroads, factories.

36:25.975 --> 36:29.103
The main problem was
the Americans wanted these jobs.

36:29.187 --> 36:33.399
These Chinese people were willing to work
at a fraction of the price.

36:35.026 --> 36:39.197
So there was a huge backlash
against Chinese with immense violence.

36:39.280 --> 36:41.157
There were shootings and lynchings.

36:41.240 --> 36:44.243
And so the Chinese
clustered around two industries,

36:44.327 --> 36:46.037
laundries and restaurants.

36:47.413 --> 36:48.956
These are both women's work,

36:49.040 --> 36:52.084
so they're not
as threatening to American men.

36:53.252 --> 36:57.006
Americans thought these strangers
ate cats. If not cats, they ate rats.

36:57.089 --> 37:00.843
In fact, the New York Times ran an article
in the late 1800s

37:00.927 --> 37:05.348
that asked, in all seriousness,
"Do the Chinese eat rats?"

37:08.142 --> 37:11.646
This idea of these people
eating strange things

37:11.729 --> 37:15.775
was used to drive a wedge
between us and foreignness.

37:17.026 --> 37:18.778
What's really interesting
is the Chinese Exclusion Act

37:18.861 --> 37:22.740
was when this concept
of illegal immigration was born.

37:23.741 --> 37:27.161
[Reichl] The Asian Exclusion Act
meant no Chinese cooks

37:27.245 --> 37:32.291
legally came into this country
until the GI Bride Act of 1945.

37:32.375 --> 37:36.003
So, food for that almost 100-year period

37:36.087 --> 37:39.966
was inexperienced cooks
dreaming of what they had eaten at home.

37:40.049 --> 37:42.593
This is why, for so many Americans,

37:42.677 --> 37:46.597
Chinese food is not worthy
of serious consideration.

37:47.682 --> 37:52.478
Honestly, racism against Asian people
is kind of okay.

37:52.561 --> 37:54.897
We don't have
that much political voice.

37:54.981 --> 37:59.068
We don't have many famous people,
though there's 15, 20 million of us.

37:59.151 --> 38:01.362
It's pretty fucked up.

38:01.445 --> 38:03.906
And one of the things that I think
is most fucked up

38:03.990 --> 38:07.410
about fried rice, Chinese food
or Asian food in general is MSG.

38:10.121 --> 38:12.873
These Chinese is noted
for MSG in the food,

38:12.957 --> 38:16.252
one of the reasons people have headaches
when they get through eating Chinese.

38:16.335 --> 38:19.755
It used to be that every customer
who came in to our Chinese restaurants

38:19.839 --> 38:21.924
-would say, "You use MSG?"
-[Yang] Yeah.

38:22.008 --> 38:25.052
-How do you feel about MSG?
-I'm the biggest apologist ever for it.

38:25.136 --> 38:25.970
You like it?

38:26.053 --> 38:29.140
I love it, and I think
that if it's gonna be vilified,

38:29.223 --> 38:32.143
then all other food ingredients
should be vilified

38:32.226 --> 38:33.936
and scrutinized just as much.

38:34.020 --> 38:36.605
And immediately, when people say,
"I don't like Chinese food,"

38:36.689 --> 38:38.733
I'm like, "Why?"
And they're like, "Oh, they add MSG."

38:38.816 --> 38:40.609
I'm like, "Oh, do I eat dog, too?"

38:40.693 --> 38:44.655
It gets a bad rap, but it's not
worse than a lot of salt.

38:44.739 --> 38:49.785
Yeah, MSG is a glutamic acid
that's attached to a salt.

38:49.869 --> 38:52.371
It is naturally occurring in the world.

38:52.455 --> 38:57.626
When people are shaving Parmesan on pasta,
it's like you're shaving MSG on food.

38:57.710 --> 39:00.921
You had immigrants coming from China
that didn't know how to cook,

39:01.005 --> 39:03.215
but if you add MSG to something,
it's going to make it taste better.

39:03.299 --> 39:05.760
-Maybe it was too much MSG.
-[Yang] Yeah.

39:05.843 --> 39:08.596
That's another thing
about people getting sick.

39:08.679 --> 39:10.514
People are more likely to think

39:10.598 --> 39:14.352
Chinese and other Asian foods
made them sick than European foods,

39:14.435 --> 39:16.771
even though, statistically,
the percentages are about the same.

39:16.854 --> 39:19.273
-No one ever says Doritos made them sick.
-[all laughing]

39:19.899 --> 39:23.235
-Look on the package. There's MSG.
-[all laughing]

39:25.613 --> 39:27.073
Hi, I'm Dave Chang.

39:27.156 --> 39:29.784
Hey, I'm Ian Mosby. I'm a food historian.

39:29.867 --> 39:32.536
We're here to talk about
monosodium glutamate,

39:32.620 --> 39:34.413
or MSG, as it's better known.

39:35.581 --> 39:41.504
I get, kind of, that dull headache thing.
I feel dehydrated sometimes for a minute.

39:41.587 --> 39:45.466
This terrible clamp,
like it was closing in on my head,

39:45.549 --> 39:47.510
and a numbness around my jaw.

39:47.593 --> 39:50.554
I still actually walk by
some Chinese restaurants,

39:50.638 --> 39:53.641
and have these memories.
I start shaking. [laughs]

39:53.724 --> 39:55.976
Do you eat junk food? Or no?

39:56.060 --> 39:57.686
Why don't I just start this out right now?

39:57.770 --> 39:59.647
[man] I'll go for the can.

39:59.730 --> 40:02.274
-[woman 1] You have another Ruffles?
-I have another Ruffles.

40:02.358 --> 40:03.692
Yes. Thank you.

40:03.776 --> 40:04.693
-[Chang] What about you?
-[woman 2] More Ruffles.

40:04.777 --> 40:05.778
Oh, my God.

40:06.612 --> 40:07.530
Mmm!

40:07.613 --> 40:10.032
You have sour cream and onion, too?

40:10.116 --> 40:10.991
Ah, that's what I got.

40:11.075 --> 40:12.576
When you wanna switch, just let me know.

40:12.660 --> 40:15.413
[Mosby] This is one of the problems
with MSG research.

40:15.496 --> 40:19.542
Most of the food you're eating
has MSG in it. All those snacks.

40:19.625 --> 40:22.336
Do any of you feel anything?

40:23.212 --> 40:25.464
It's happening right now
with these Doritos.

40:25.548 --> 40:26.632
[chuckles] These are really spicy.

40:26.715 --> 40:28.843
-[Chang] It's really spicy, right?
-[chuckles] Yeah.

40:28.926 --> 40:32.430
MSG is one of the most used food additives
in the US.

40:32.513 --> 40:35.683
Millions of tons of that stuff
get used every year.

40:35.766 --> 40:39.395
But most of it doesn't get used
by Chinese restaurants.

40:39.478 --> 40:42.690
Most of it gets used
by the food processing industry.

40:42.773 --> 40:44.608
But maybe it's about quantity.

40:44.692 --> 40:48.988
If I'm indulging in a snack like this,
it's not a meal.

40:49.071 --> 40:52.867
Whereas I'm having an entire meal
at Chinese restaurants,

40:52.950 --> 40:54.410
-I'd go crazy.
-[woman] Yeah.

40:54.493 --> 40:57.121
-[man] I will make a meal out of that.
-[people chuckling]

40:57.204 --> 41:00.708
In some of the early studies,
this was a disease they called

41:00.791 --> 41:04.920
"Chinese Restaurant Syndrome."
They didn't call it MSG Syndrome.

41:05.004 --> 41:06.297
Maybe if you start thinking,

41:06.380 --> 41:09.258
"What are some of the things people
associate with Chinese restaurants?"

41:09.341 --> 41:12.386
Like mystery meat and...
You know what I'm saying?

41:12.470 --> 41:14.805
You see a meat dish and it's $4.95,

41:14.889 --> 41:17.725
you're skeptical, like,
"Where is this sourced from?"

41:17.808 --> 41:20.269
When I was growing up,
we lived near a Chinese restaurant,

41:20.352 --> 41:22.313
and everyone said,
in the dumpster behind it,

41:22.396 --> 41:27.401
there are always lots of cat carcasses,
which I'm sure was a rumor.

41:27.485 --> 41:32.198
It's worth thinking about other cuisines
of people who are racialized.

41:32.281 --> 41:34.074
If you look at Mexican cuisine in the US,

41:34.158 --> 41:37.578
what are some of the health associations
that people have with Mexican food?

41:37.661 --> 41:41.999
You have to eat it on the bowl,
because you won't make it to the bathroom.

41:42.082 --> 41:44.627
That's basically the assumption.

41:44.710 --> 41:46.670
I never have that problem.
I love Mexican food.

41:46.754 --> 41:50.883
I look at this, and I'm not the scientist,
I'm not Ian.

41:50.966 --> 41:53.802
But I'm like, "Wait a second.
Something's not right here, guys."

41:53.886 --> 41:56.847
It's not people individually being racist.

41:56.931 --> 42:01.644
It's racist assumptions
that are held on a pretty large scale.

42:02.394 --> 42:05.064
We develop those biases because

42:05.147 --> 42:08.526
we just keep hearing about it,
assume it's true.

42:08.609 --> 42:09.985
Could be psychological.

42:10.069 --> 42:14.365
Whether it's, "Don't go to this restaurant
because you're gonna get sick,"

42:14.448 --> 42:19.286
I tend to see more of that run by not just
Chinese people or Korean people,

42:19.370 --> 42:21.914
but essentially anyone that's ethnic.

42:21.997 --> 42:26.627
And, yeah, I definitely think that puts
a ceiling in how far cuisine can go.

42:31.131 --> 42:33.592
In America,
when you think of a fancy restaurant,

42:33.676 --> 42:36.512
you think French,
or maybe you think sushi,

42:36.595 --> 42:37.763
maybe you think Japanese.

42:37.846 --> 42:39.640
But you don't usually think
of a Chinese restaurant.

42:39.723 --> 42:40.891
I think there's something to that.

42:40.975 --> 42:43.936
Part of it is that there are more
wealthy Japanese immigrants

42:44.019 --> 42:45.396
coming to the US.

42:45.479 --> 42:49.817
Whereas the mass of Chinese immigrants
is still more working class.

42:49.900 --> 42:51.026
Like New York City,

42:51.110 --> 42:53.195
there are a lot of working-class
Chinese people here.

42:53.279 --> 42:57.449
That's part of the reason Chinese food
hasn't reached that level yet.

42:57.533 --> 43:00.536
This could be the best Chinese restaurant
in New York City,

43:00.619 --> 43:02.621
and it will never get four stars
in the New York Times.

43:02.705 --> 43:04.331
It'll always get two stars.

43:04.415 --> 43:06.208
[Dai] Right. It has that block.

43:06.292 --> 43:09.753
Because of the decor,
because of the service,

43:09.837 --> 43:11.255
because it's always gonna be viewed

43:11.338 --> 43:14.341
by essentially a white prism
of what is a certain--

43:14.425 --> 43:16.677
-[Dai] The lens is always white. Yeah.
-Yeah.

43:28.564 --> 43:32.735
[Chang] Toronto has six Chinatowns.
You see Chinatowns in cities,

43:32.818 --> 43:35.654
but they're probably
not real Chinatowns anymore.

43:35.738 --> 43:37.990
Chinese immigrants moved,
and then they got displaced,

43:38.073 --> 43:40.701
then they went further and further out.

43:40.784 --> 43:43.912
Markham is probably
the predominant Chinese suburb.

43:43.996 --> 43:44.830
"China-burbs."

43:45.998 --> 43:48.459
And the food there is spectacular.

43:50.294 --> 43:54.882
I was always surprised at why didn't more
non-Chinese people eat there.

43:54.965 --> 43:58.093
[Chris Nutall-Smith] Restaurants used to
be effectively segregated.

43:58.177 --> 44:03.724
There were white-people, Korean,
Chinese, Ethiopian restaurants.

44:03.807 --> 44:05.309
And people did not mix.

44:05.392 --> 44:06.769
Criticism was the same.

44:06.852 --> 44:09.855
If you were writing
for the big, national newspaper,

44:09.938 --> 44:12.566
you were writing for white, rich people.

44:12.650 --> 44:15.486
-I've never written about this place.
-Why not?

44:15.569 --> 44:17.655
Because I missed it,
and I hang my head in shame.

44:17.738 --> 44:19.281
-I missed it.
-You should.

44:21.116 --> 44:23.535
How many people for the lobster mountain?

44:24.286 --> 44:28.332
For the lobster mountain,
we have 15, 25 and 50 pounds.

44:28.415 --> 44:30.584
-And it's about this high, right?
-Um...

44:30.668 --> 44:34.838
This high, I think, 50 pounds. Yes.
It would be huge, the lobster.

44:34.922 --> 44:36.298
Okay. I'm scared.

44:36.382 --> 44:38.258
I'll bring the 25-pound lobster.

44:38.342 --> 44:39.551
-[Chang] Okay.
-[waitress] All right.

44:41.303 --> 44:47.810
So much of traditional super high-end
restaurants is about European decor

44:47.893 --> 44:49.812
that looks, for the most part,

44:49.895 --> 44:53.982
it fell out of
a Williams-Sonoma catalog or Polo.

44:54.066 --> 44:57.694
There is still a discounting
of international food,

44:57.778 --> 45:00.030
or as old-guard critics would call it,
"ethnic food."

45:00.114 --> 45:02.699
I fucking hate that term,
but they would call it "ethnic food."

45:02.783 --> 45:04.827
As a layperson, I would say

45:04.910 --> 45:08.205
the waiter could punch me
in the face if the food is good enough.

45:08.288 --> 45:10.374
If the food is really good...

45:10.457 --> 45:13.710
If it's a really good piece of pork,
or whatever it is,

45:13.794 --> 45:16.046
dude, they could insult my family...

45:16.130 --> 45:17.798
[Nutall-Smith]
I got a place you're gonna love.

45:17.881 --> 45:19.174
[Chang laughs]

45:19.258 --> 45:21.051
Oh, my God. Here it is.

45:21.135 --> 45:22.261
[Chang] Jesus.

45:32.688 --> 45:34.982
-[Yang] We could eat that.
-[Chang] So ridiculous.

45:35.065 --> 45:36.233
[laughs]

45:37.192 --> 45:39.486
[Yang] I love it.
Oh, the heads are really key.

45:39.570 --> 45:42.406
Part of life. Taking photos of food.

45:43.365 --> 45:44.533
-All right.
-[Nutall-Smith] Man.

45:44.616 --> 45:46.243
I'm just gonna go in.

45:48.704 --> 45:50.289
[Yang] He's gonna do it.

45:52.124 --> 45:54.626
The batter is so light.
Doesn't absorb any oil.

45:54.710 --> 45:56.253
-[Yang] I'm shocked.
-This is crazy.

45:56.336 --> 45:59.423
Why isn't all lobster
prepared this way?

45:59.506 --> 46:01.758
Is this not the best thing in goddamn

46:01.842 --> 46:03.760
-anywhere?
-[Nutall-Smith chuckles] Yeah.

46:03.844 --> 46:06.013
[Yang] It's hard to beat, man.

46:06.096 --> 46:10.392
[Chang] I'm a classicist at heart.
I love French, three-Michelin-star dining.

46:10.476 --> 46:12.352
I love all of that stuff.

46:12.436 --> 46:18.066
But for me, this is equal or more joy now
than eating anything that's super fancy.

46:18.817 --> 46:21.570
I don't know if I've pronounced it right.

46:21.653 --> 46:24.865
It's Lobster Clubhouse
Fishman Boathouse?

46:24.948 --> 46:26.909
[all laughing]

46:26.992 --> 46:28.243
-[Xie] It's a joke, right?
-No, I'm serious.

46:28.327 --> 46:30.412
I said it every way.
Which is it?

46:30.496 --> 46:32.498
It's Fishman Lobster Clubhouse.

46:32.581 --> 46:35.959
-There's no Boathouse?
-No. There's no boat. [laughs]

46:36.043 --> 46:42.382
The name is actually... My brother,
who is not quite fluent in English,

46:42.466 --> 46:45.010
and he likes this long name.

46:45.093 --> 46:47.804
-Like a law firm. [laughs]
-[chuckles] Like a law firm. Exactly.

46:47.888 --> 46:50.891
[Chang] The decor. The chandeliers
and the color scheme...

46:50.974 --> 46:52.017
Is it Chinese?

46:52.100 --> 46:55.479
Have you felt any pressure at all
to change what you do?

46:55.562 --> 46:59.525
To change your decor or food
to appeal to white folks from downtown?

46:59.608 --> 47:03.070
I would like to stick with
the recipe that works.

47:03.153 --> 47:05.531
You believe in yourself that you can.

47:05.614 --> 47:08.492
You just stick to it.
That's your belief.

47:08.575 --> 47:13.997
Stick to what you believe,
and eventually it will come through.

47:15.958 --> 47:19.127
[Yang] There's a point where you start
losing your edge.

47:19.211 --> 47:20.837
You learn too many rules.

47:20.921 --> 47:22.798
You learn you're not supposed
to do this kind of thing,

47:22.881 --> 47:26.385
and when you're younger,
you're too dumb to know that stuff.

47:26.468 --> 47:28.554
You're too dumb.
You're trying stuff that shouldn't work,

47:28.637 --> 47:30.889
and that's when new stuff
gets invented, right?

47:30.973 --> 47:35.644
Right. Now that I'm married
and hopefully have a family,

47:35.727 --> 47:38.105
I wouldn't have started Momofuku.

47:38.188 --> 47:40.482
-Too much at stake.
-Too much to lose.

47:40.566 --> 47:44.403
That being said, I'm not married,
and I don't have a family.

47:44.486 --> 47:49.241
And I'm gonna try to eke the remaining
years out of my lack of responsibility

47:49.324 --> 47:53.537
before I'm just old and dumb like you.
[laughing]

47:53.620 --> 47:56.081
[Chang] The goal now
is to create an environment

47:56.164 --> 47:57.457
where people are gonna be happier.

47:57.541 --> 48:01.336
And I'd rather take away from
the cutting-edge edginess,

48:01.420 --> 48:04.339
and just have more nourishing,
delicious food.

48:05.090 --> 48:08.677
I'm really stripping away everything
and trying to focus on

48:08.760 --> 48:12.306
the human emotion.
How someone's gonna feel about this.

48:16.852 --> 48:20.314
I feel like how I can help
is getting people to eat stuff

48:20.397 --> 48:23.191
that they might not normally want to eat.

48:23.275 --> 48:24.484
I can't change their politics,

48:24.568 --> 48:28.071
but maybe I can by opening up
their viewpoints to food.

48:28.155 --> 48:33.201
Yes. You can get them to eat Asian food,
I can put brown and yellow people on TV.

48:33.285 --> 48:35.287
[chuckles] Let's do the best we can,
right?

48:35.370 --> 48:36.955
That's literally how
I've been meditating on this.

48:37.039 --> 48:41.418
-Like, "This is how I can do it."
-Yeah. It's true, man. It's true.

48:43.795 --> 48:45.297
[Chang] There are foods
that I grew up loving,

48:45.380 --> 48:48.759
but I was embarrassed to publicly love.

48:48.842 --> 48:53.764
It's like, "Oh, that food, you like that?
That's gross. You're inferior culture."

48:54.640 --> 48:59.227
Some of that is just our default setting
in who we are as human beings.

48:59.311 --> 49:02.522
And I think it behooves us
to fight those urges,

49:02.606 --> 49:06.026
and be a little bit more sympathetic
to what's going on.

49:06.109 --> 49:10.906
It's easier to be ignorant.
It's easier to cast aside things.

49:10.989 --> 49:13.325
I think we're all guilty of that.
