WEBVTT

00:04.921 --> 00:06.339
My name is Bridget.

00:06.381 --> 00:07.799
I witnessed a murder.

00:07.841 --> 00:09.467
Just get up on the stand

00:09.509 --> 00:10.677
and tell the judge what you saw,
and we'll protect you.

00:10.719 --> 00:11.928
You don't get it.

00:11.970 --> 00:13.638
Bodaway wants me dead,

00:13.680 --> 00:15.432
I'm dead.

00:15.473 --> 00:17.726
BRIDGET: I ran to my sister
Siobhan for help.

00:17.767 --> 00:20.103
Siobhan killed herself,
and I assumed her identity.

00:20.145 --> 00:21.771
It was so easy.

00:21.813 --> 00:23.773
I saw a way out,
and I took it.

00:23.815 --> 00:25.316
They all think that I'm her.

00:25.358 --> 00:26.568
Two of the six investors

00:26.609 --> 00:28.486
we landed last month
have pulled out.

00:28.528 --> 00:30.155
If we don't score someone big
enough to cover those losses,

00:30.196 --> 00:32.157
you know what that could mean.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.575
This is Tyler Barrett.

00:33.616 --> 00:36.494
I have reason to believe there
might be some...

00:36.536 --> 00:39.456
less-than-scrupulous activity
going on in my company.

00:39.497 --> 00:41.541
Martin/Charles
is running a Ponzi scheme.

00:41.583 --> 00:43.626
I still don't think
Andrew's the one behind it.

00:43.668 --> 00:45.754
You've worked with Olivia
forever, and to find out

00:45.795 --> 00:47.547
that she's been betraying
you all this time...

00:47.589 --> 00:50.550
The Ponzi scheme
wasn't Olivia's idea.

00:50.592 --> 00:51.885
It was mine.

00:56.306 --> 00:58.183
[car horn honks]

01:02.103 --> 01:04.230
[knocking]

01:11.404 --> 01:13.948
What are these for?

01:13.990 --> 01:16.201
How about for being
a jealous douche bag

01:16.242 --> 01:18.244
when I saw your brother
on the computer?

01:18.286 --> 01:20.455
Or for not getting
to see you sooner?

01:20.497 --> 01:21.706
Make it back to Paris
finally, and I get stuck

01:21.748 --> 01:23.124
at a stupid conference
in Rome.

01:23.166 --> 01:24.584
It doesn't matter.
They're beautiful.

01:24.626 --> 01:26.211
Thank you.

01:32.258 --> 01:35.804
So you've, uh, been
to the doctor,

01:35.845 --> 01:37.222
and everything is OK?

01:37.263 --> 01:39.349
Yeah, everything's fine.

01:39.390 --> 01:41.309
[sighs] Well, we have
a lot to figure out.

01:41.351 --> 01:43.728
Can't be hiding out
with a baby.

01:43.770 --> 01:45.814
That's why we need
to take care of Andrew.

01:45.855 --> 01:47.899
Did you bring the data you
got from Martin/Charles?

01:50.777 --> 01:53.446
Those documents show
a rate of return

01:53.488 --> 01:55.323
that's so steady,
it's impossible.

01:55.365 --> 01:58.701
It's suspicious, but
it's not a smoking gun.

01:58.743 --> 02:01.454
Do you have the reports
that you got

02:01.496 --> 02:03.331
from Andrew's
home computer?

02:03.373 --> 02:06.459
These numbers are
completely different.

02:06.501 --> 02:09.045
-Are you sure?
-I'm pretty sure.

02:09.087 --> 02:11.131
I had them
on a flash drive.

02:12.799 --> 02:16.261
TYLER: Well, then we have
all the proof we need.

02:16.302 --> 02:18.346
Maybe we should just...

02:20.056 --> 02:22.392
...go to
the authorities?

02:22.433 --> 02:25.186
Tyler, it's too soon.

02:25.228 --> 02:27.105
I have to protect myself.

02:29.774 --> 02:33.778
How does turning in
Andrew hurt you?

02:33.820 --> 02:36.281
I'm his wife. The second
this comes to light,

02:36.322 --> 02:37.949
they'll freeze
all of his assets.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.200
I'll be left with nothing.

02:39.242 --> 02:40.493
I'll get a new job.

02:40.535 --> 02:41.995
I'll support us.

02:42.036 --> 02:44.789
I wish it was that simple.

02:44.831 --> 02:48.209
You don't understand
what Andrew's capable of.

02:48.251 --> 02:50.628
I know this is a lot,

02:50.670 --> 02:53.131
and if it's too much,
and you want to leave,
I'll understand.

02:53.173 --> 02:57.552
Siobhan, all I want is
for us to be together,
to be a family.

02:57.594 --> 03:00.597
Then can you trust me
a little bit longer?

03:07.437 --> 03:08.897
You know,
I completely forgot

03:08.938 --> 03:10.523
that I put the flash drive

03:10.565 --> 03:12.400
in the hotel safe downstairs.

03:12.442 --> 03:14.360
It can wait till tomorrow.

03:14.402 --> 03:17.363
Tonight is gonna be...

03:19.240 --> 03:21.326
...just about us.

03:21.367 --> 03:22.744
The three of us.

03:24.746 --> 03:26.289
[car horns honking]

03:28.166 --> 03:32.378
What do you mean, you were
behind the Ponzi scheme?

03:32.420 --> 03:35.256
Everything points to Olivia.

03:35.298 --> 03:37.634
She handles
the details, but...

03:37.675 --> 03:40.428
it was all my idea.

03:41.930 --> 03:44.432
Why?

03:44.474 --> 03:47.101
We made a series
of bad investments.

03:47.143 --> 03:50.355
It wasn't enough
to cover expenses,

03:50.396 --> 03:54.776
so I used money from
new investors to pay
out existing ones.

03:54.817 --> 03:56.569
It was only supposed
to be temporary.

03:56.611 --> 03:59.447
But then,
the economy collapsed,
and more investors

03:59.489 --> 04:02.283
demanded payouts,
and we got in
over our heads.

04:02.325 --> 04:05.453
But I've started
a high-frequency
trading program

04:05.495 --> 04:07.830
using computers
to outsmart the market.

04:07.872 --> 04:11.834
We can use the extra
profit to dig ourselves
out of this hole.

04:11.876 --> 04:13.753
Look, I'm so sorry,
Siobhan.

04:13.795 --> 04:18.007
I hoped that I'd never
have to tell you this.

04:18.049 --> 04:20.551
And that's why when you
came to me before

04:20.593 --> 04:22.470
with your suspicions
about Martin/Charles

04:22.512 --> 04:24.097
that I told you that
you didn't know

04:24.138 --> 04:25.598
what you were
talking about.

04:27.600 --> 04:30.520
When I came to you...
before?

04:30.561 --> 04:32.605
The way things were
between us,

04:32.647 --> 04:35.024
I was afraid you
were gonna turn me in.

04:35.066 --> 04:38.611
But now, look, I can't
lie to you any...

04:41.072 --> 04:44.659
I need s... some time.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.788
[line ringing]

05:30.830 --> 05:32.457
LANFAIR: S.E.C. Lanfair.

05:32.498 --> 05:34.334
Mr. Lanfair, it's Tyler Barrett.

05:34.375 --> 05:36.711
I got the proof I promised you
that Martin/Charles is corrupt.

05:36.753 --> 05:38.880
Let me take a look.

05:38.921 --> 05:41.299
I'll e-mail you a link
to a secure FTP site,
and we...

05:41.341 --> 05:44.093
What I've got is damning enough
to take down the entire company.

05:44.135 --> 05:46.846
You're not seeing anything
until I'm guaranteed immunity.

05:46.888 --> 05:49.265
No promises
until we see something.

05:53.644 --> 05:56.856
I really thought Olivia was
behind the Ponzi scheme.

05:56.898 --> 05:59.609
She's a conniving bitch.

05:59.650 --> 06:01.611
Andrew?

06:01.652 --> 06:03.112
[sighs]

06:03.154 --> 06:08.785
Everything at
Martin/Charles is a lie.

06:08.826 --> 06:10.536
And everything in this house

06:10.578 --> 06:12.288
is paid for
with stolen money.

06:12.330 --> 06:14.957
Where's Andrew now?

06:14.999 --> 06:16.501
Work, I guess.

06:16.542 --> 06:18.920
He stayed in the guest room
last night.

06:18.961 --> 06:21.506
Thank God Catherine took
Juliet to Canyon Ranch,

06:21.547 --> 06:24.300
so at least she's not here
for any of this.

06:24.342 --> 06:29.013
I know you
never trusted Andrew, so...

06:29.055 --> 06:30.973
I guess now you have
your proof.

06:31.015 --> 06:33.518
Honestly, I'm a little
surprised you're
judging him so harshly,

06:33.559 --> 06:35.144
given your
own situation.

06:35.186 --> 06:37.980
I had to pretend
to be Siobhan.

06:38.022 --> 06:39.732
Now I can't make
things right.

06:39.774 --> 06:45.029
It... it's exactly
how Andrew is feeling.

06:45.071 --> 06:47.949
God, I am such a hypocrite.

06:47.990 --> 06:52.161
And he took such a big leap
of faith in telling me.

06:52.203 --> 06:55.957
He lied to Siobhan,
but he couldn't lie to me.

06:55.998 --> 06:59.127
Wait. Siobhan
confronted Andrew?

06:59.168 --> 07:01.712
Apparently.

07:01.754 --> 07:04.382
If the truth about
Martin/Charles gets out,

07:04.424 --> 07:06.384
Andrew's finished.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.594
Maybe he took steps
to protect himself.

07:08.636 --> 07:10.513
Are you saying that you think

07:10.555 --> 07:12.181
that Andrew is behind
the hit on Siobhan?

07:12.223 --> 07:13.558
No! And besides,

07:13.599 --> 07:15.768
the last clue that we
found was the footprints

07:15.810 --> 07:17.603
in Siobhan's office;
they were woman's footprints.

07:17.645 --> 07:18.855
They could have been
Olivia's.

07:18.896 --> 07:20.982
Andrew confessed.

07:21.023 --> 07:22.358
You don't kill
to protect a secret

07:22.400 --> 07:24.402
you just told someone.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.946
Andrew is not capable
of murdering anyone.

07:26.988 --> 07:28.531
Yesterday you were
convinced

07:28.573 --> 07:30.366
he would never run
a Ponzi scheme.

07:30.408 --> 07:32.410
Your feelings are
clouding your judgment!

07:36.998 --> 07:39.584
The way I see it,
you have two choices:

07:39.625 --> 07:42.253
testify against Bodaway

07:42.295 --> 07:44.338
or leave and make
a clean start
somewhere new.

07:44.380 --> 07:46.007
But you can't stay here

07:46.048 --> 07:48.259
where it's more
dangerous than what
you left behind!

07:48.301 --> 07:52.805
You think Andrew might kill
me, but I know Bodaway will.

07:52.847 --> 07:54.557
There's no way I

07:54.599 --> 07:56.767
can go back to my old life,
and I am not running again.

07:56.809 --> 07:58.436
Don't do this, Bridge!

07:58.478 --> 08:00.354
We both wanted
to give Andrew

08:00.396 --> 08:01.939
the benefit
of the doubt before.

08:01.981 --> 08:03.774
But this is your
life at stake.

08:03.816 --> 08:05.401
You think
that I don't know that?!

08:05.443 --> 08:08.196
But come on, Malcolm!
I have lived

08:08.237 --> 08:10.156
in this house under
the same roof with Andrew

08:10.198 --> 08:13.409
for months safe and sound.

08:13.451 --> 08:15.620
Andrew Martin
may be a liar--

08:15.661 --> 08:17.455
hey, he might be a crook--

08:17.497 --> 08:19.832
but he's not a murderer.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.044
And if you can't
accept that, then...

08:24.837 --> 08:27.048
I'm sorry,
I think you should leave.

08:35.848 --> 08:37.016
[elevator bell dings,
door opens]

08:37.058 --> 08:38.267
[phone ringing]

08:38.309 --> 08:40.520
MAN: FBI, Denver Field Office...

08:45.316 --> 08:50.112
Welcome to the Bodaway Macawi
Task Force.

08:50.154 --> 08:52.114
Torrance.

08:52.156 --> 08:54.992
I was told
to report here.

08:55.034 --> 08:56.661
I didn't know
I'd be reporting to you.

08:56.702 --> 08:59.664
Look, I know Macawi
used to be your case,

08:59.705 --> 09:03.626
but your best lead was
the Shaylene Briggs murder.

09:03.668 --> 09:05.002
Now that Jimmy Kemper's
confessed,

09:05.044 --> 09:06.462
the R.D. wanted
to try a different tack.

09:06.504 --> 09:09.131
Kemper's
confession's bogus.

09:09.173 --> 09:11.300
I got a witness who
saw Macawi kill
Shaylene Briggs.

09:11.342 --> 09:13.844
Oh, Bridget Kelly?

09:13.886 --> 09:16.347
If she's so willing
to testify,

09:16.389 --> 09:18.474
why do you spend 50 grand
of the Bureau's money

09:18.516 --> 09:21.185
chasing her, only to come
back empty-handed?

09:21.227 --> 09:24.689
We're doing things
my way now, Vic.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.899
I'm mounting a joint
task force with the ATF.

09:26.941 --> 09:28.818
We're going after Macawi
for cigarette trafficking.

09:28.859 --> 09:30.236
[chuckles]
Hey, you think

09:30.278 --> 09:31.487
I didn't try
that angle?

09:31.529 --> 09:32.697
I know Macawi.
It's not gonna work.

09:32.738 --> 09:36.117
Maybe I know
a different side of him.

09:36.158 --> 09:37.910
When it comes to Macawi,

09:37.952 --> 09:39.912
your focus is
a little, uh...

09:39.954 --> 09:42.707
distorted.

09:42.748 --> 09:44.333
How are you gonna
build a case when you

09:44.375 --> 09:46.669
can't even get your
basics straight, huh?

09:46.711 --> 09:48.462
This guy here,
Nathan Purdue?

09:48.504 --> 09:50.172
Not a bookie.

09:50.214 --> 09:52.592
Clarence Rudy?
Guy barely knows Macawi.

09:52.633 --> 09:54.594
He's a wannabe.

09:54.635 --> 09:56.262
You got me, Vic.

09:56.304 --> 09:58.431
There are some mistakes
on this board.

09:58.472 --> 10:00.224
Like this one...

10:00.266 --> 10:02.184
Bridget Kelly?

10:02.226 --> 10:04.270
She's no longer part
of this case.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.903
[dance music playing]

10:21.871 --> 10:25.499
Has anyone ever told you
you have amazing eyes?

10:25.541 --> 10:27.043
[chuckles]

10:27.084 --> 10:28.919
Uh-huh, once or twice.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.504
Mm.

10:30.546 --> 10:33.215
So, you, uh, want me
to rock your world?

10:33.257 --> 10:35.217
Thanks, but I'm good.

10:35.259 --> 10:36.636
Whatever.

10:39.180 --> 10:41.182
[woman laughing]

10:52.568 --> 10:55.112
So, what'll it be, Vic?

10:55.154 --> 10:56.489
Hmm?

10:56.530 --> 10:58.240
A little lap dance?

10:58.282 --> 11:00.618
Maybe the champagne court?

11:00.660 --> 11:02.953
You know why I'm here,
Shaylene.

11:02.995 --> 11:06.582
Hmm. I thought you
might surprise me.

11:08.459 --> 11:11.462
You know, I was her age
when I started dancing.

11:15.007 --> 11:17.301
Supposed to be
temporary--

11:17.343 --> 11:19.804
just to earn enough
money to get my
real estate license.

11:19.845 --> 11:22.973
[laughs]

11:23.015 --> 11:25.685
That was ten years ago.

11:25.726 --> 11:29.105
It's not too late
to make a change.

11:29.146 --> 11:31.023
Maybe even get
that real estate license.

11:31.065 --> 11:32.858
Wow.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.694
The money's
that good, huh?

11:34.735 --> 11:35.986
Mm.

11:40.491 --> 11:45.037
What you're
asking me to do...

11:45.079 --> 11:47.248
it's dangerous, right?

11:47.289 --> 11:49.041
Look, I'm not
going to lie.

11:49.083 --> 11:51.460
It's Bodaway Macawi, so,
yeah, there's risk involved,

11:51.502 --> 11:53.671
but I give you my word,

11:53.713 --> 11:55.798
I'll do everything I can
to keep you safe.

11:58.426 --> 12:01.053
I don't get it.

12:01.095 --> 12:03.013
Why me?

12:03.055 --> 12:04.598
I've watched you.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.267
Mm.

12:06.308 --> 12:09.228
I see the way
you look at people.

12:09.270 --> 12:13.733
You're good at sizing them
up, figuring them out.

12:13.774 --> 12:16.068
Haven't figured you
out yet.

12:16.110 --> 12:17.611
Oh, that's exactly
how I like it.

12:17.653 --> 12:19.447
[laughing]

12:25.953 --> 12:27.288
All right.

12:29.123 --> 12:31.500
I'm in.

12:31.542 --> 12:34.253
You're going to get a job
at Macawi's strip club--

12:34.295 --> 12:35.838
Club Caged.

12:38.841 --> 12:40.384
MALCOLM: I probably shouldn't
be here right now,

12:40.426 --> 12:42.720
but things at Martin/Charles
aren't what they seem.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.181
But you know that, right?

12:45.222 --> 12:47.433
That's why you
brought Siobhan the box.

12:47.475 --> 12:50.019
You wanted her
to know the truth.

12:50.060 --> 12:54.231
OK. What are you
talking about?

12:54.273 --> 12:57.234
Siobhan
confronted Andrew.

12:57.276 --> 12:58.652
And I think he'll
do anything

12:58.694 --> 13:01.155
to keep his secret
from getting out--

13:01.197 --> 13:03.073
maybe even
hurt Siobhan.

13:03.115 --> 13:06.535
All right, that is just...
that is crazy.

13:06.577 --> 13:08.120
And even if it's true,

13:08.162 --> 13:10.539
why... why are you
coming to me, Malcolm?

13:10.581 --> 13:13.292
Siobhan told me
about the affair.

13:13.334 --> 13:14.543
Don't worry.

13:14.585 --> 13:16.128
I'm not interested
in telling anyone.

13:16.170 --> 13:18.005
OK, if you know
about the affair,

13:18.047 --> 13:19.882
then you also know
that it is over.

13:19.924 --> 13:21.300
Whatever happened

13:21.342 --> 13:22.927
between you
and Siobhan,

13:22.968 --> 13:24.804
I know you loved
her once.

13:24.845 --> 13:26.430
You can't want her dead.

13:28.933 --> 13:31.727
No, of course I don't.

13:31.769 --> 13:35.272
You know what Andrew is
doing at Martin/Charles

13:35.314 --> 13:37.775
and what he's
capable of.

13:37.817 --> 13:38.984
You're the only
other person

13:39.026 --> 13:40.444
that knows
the truth.

13:40.486 --> 13:41.862
If you talk to Siobhan

13:41.904 --> 13:45.157
and tell her you think
he might hurt her,

13:45.199 --> 13:46.826
maybe you can convince
her to put some distance

13:46.867 --> 13:49.620
between herself
and Andrew.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.205
That's all I want.

13:52.748 --> 13:54.375
You told Siobhan
the truth?

13:54.416 --> 13:56.544
Why on Earth
would you do that?

13:56.585 --> 13:58.170
Oh, never mind.

13:58.212 --> 13:59.588
I can't take any more
of your lovesick drivel.

13:59.630 --> 14:01.882
Calm down, Olivia.

14:01.924 --> 14:04.093
I explained we're using
HFT to change things.

14:04.134 --> 14:05.678
Oh, please.

14:05.719 --> 14:07.471
Even Siobhan's not stupid
enough to believe that.

14:07.513 --> 14:09.098
Don't patronize me.

14:09.139 --> 14:10.808
Do you know how many
nights I've laid awake

14:10.850 --> 14:12.810
trying to figure out a
way that Martin/Charles

14:12.852 --> 14:15.396
doesn't ultimately
collapse?

14:15.437 --> 14:17.773
There is no palatable
exit strategy.

14:17.815 --> 14:19.817
One day, it
will fall apart.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.527
But if we keep
going with HFT,

14:21.569 --> 14:23.362
at least we can give
our investors something

14:23.404 --> 14:24.697
when that happens.

14:24.738 --> 14:26.365
And what about us?

14:26.407 --> 14:28.242
When the end comes,
I plan to be

14:28.284 --> 14:30.202
on a beach far away
with plenty of cash.

14:30.244 --> 14:32.454
I will not let your wife
ruin that for me.

14:32.496 --> 14:34.081
[cell phone chimes]

14:37.084 --> 14:40.296
Look, a few months ago,
that was my plan, too,

14:40.337 --> 14:42.840
but now I don't
care where I am

14:42.882 --> 14:44.592
as long as I'm
with Siobhan.

14:46.677 --> 14:49.388
Even if you're sharing
a jail cell?

14:49.430 --> 14:51.891
You may be sure of
Siobhan right now,

14:51.932 --> 14:53.642
but not so long ago,
we were taking

14:53.684 --> 14:55.144
much more drastic measures.

14:55.185 --> 14:56.645
I'm aware
of our history,

14:56.687 --> 14:58.647
but things are
different now.

14:58.689 --> 15:00.774
We're not ready for
the nuclear option.

15:06.697 --> 15:08.324
Nice to see you, Mrs. Martin.

15:10.284 --> 15:11.702
Is everything OK?

15:11.744 --> 15:12.912
Yeah.

15:12.953 --> 15:14.204
Is Andrew available?

15:14.246 --> 15:15.497
He's just finishing up
a meeting.

15:15.539 --> 15:16.916
Would you like to wait
in his office?

15:16.957 --> 15:18.417
Yeah. Um, I will.

15:18.459 --> 15:19.960
Thank you.

15:23.255 --> 15:24.882
[cell phone chimes]

15:24.924 --> 15:28.177
ANDREW: Will you turn
that damn thing off?

15:28.218 --> 15:30.512
Got a source
inside the S.E.C.

15:30.554 --> 15:31.889
Last week, he told me

15:31.931 --> 15:33.474
we had a mole
inside the Paris branch.

15:33.515 --> 15:35.309
He just found out who.

15:35.351 --> 15:37.978
Tyler Barrett.

15:38.020 --> 15:39.730
Tyler?

15:39.772 --> 15:41.023
I mean, what could
he possibly know?

15:41.065 --> 15:42.483
We've only just
promoted him.

15:45.611 --> 15:46.987
What did he give them?

15:47.029 --> 15:49.490
Nothing of consequence
as of yet.

15:49.531 --> 15:51.241
I'll get Tyler on
the first plane to New York,

15:51.283 --> 15:53.994
find out exactly what he
knows, who he's spoken to.

15:56.246 --> 15:58.874
I don't care
what it takes.

15:58.916 --> 16:01.043
Make sure Tyler
doesn't talk.

16:10.135 --> 16:11.637
Malcolm, you should have heard

16:11.679 --> 16:13.639
the way they
were talking.

16:13.681 --> 16:15.557
It was like they would do
anything to keep Tyler quiet.

16:15.599 --> 16:17.726
MALCOLM: Remind me
who Tyler is.

16:17.768 --> 16:19.728
BRIDGET: He worked
at Martin/Charles in Paris.

16:19.770 --> 16:23.273
Tyler and Siobhan
knew each other intimately.

16:23.315 --> 16:26.026
I didn't realize
I was sleeping with
the boss's wife.

16:26.068 --> 16:28.529
Excuse me?

16:28.570 --> 16:30.864
How many guys was your
sister sleeping with?

16:30.906 --> 16:32.241
Too many.

16:32.282 --> 16:35.327
But this one knew
about the Ponzi scheme.

16:35.369 --> 16:37.830
Maybe that's how Siobhan
found out about it.

16:37.871 --> 16:39.915
Maybe he told her.
Who knows?

16:39.957 --> 16:41.333
He might have some answers.

16:41.375 --> 16:43.127
Look, uh...

16:43.168 --> 16:45.713
what we were talking
about earlier, I...

16:47.881 --> 16:50.592
I still don't believe
that Andrew would hurt me.

16:50.634 --> 16:53.220
But the way they were
talking about Tyler, I...

16:53.262 --> 16:55.472
I'm... I'm packing up.

16:55.514 --> 16:58.142
I'm going to stay at
a hotel for a few days.

16:58.183 --> 17:00.144
You don't know how
relieved I am to hear that.

17:00.185 --> 17:01.729
You want me
to track down Tyler?

17:01.770 --> 17:03.313
I'm already on it.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.235
Hey, Mr. Lanfair.
It's Tyler Barrett.

17:08.277 --> 17:11.280
Uh, Martin/Charles booked me
on the next flight to New York.

17:11.321 --> 17:13.657
Uh, they wouldn't tell me
why, but I think I need to go.

17:13.699 --> 17:15.451
I don't want to make them
suspicious.

17:15.492 --> 17:16.952
I'll call you when I can.

17:26.420 --> 17:29.339
I didn't mean
to scare you.

17:29.381 --> 17:31.091
Claudine told me
you stopped by,

17:31.133 --> 17:33.218
but when I got
back to my office,
you were gone.

17:34.845 --> 17:36.930
Yeah, I completely
forgot I, um...

17:36.972 --> 17:38.640
had an appointment
across town.

17:38.682 --> 17:40.225
Ah.

17:44.354 --> 17:45.939
Are you leaving?

17:47.232 --> 17:48.859
Just for a few days.

17:51.403 --> 17:55.324
Siobhan,
please... talk to me.

17:55.365 --> 17:57.743
Don't go. I'll stay
in the guest bedroom

17:57.785 --> 17:59.620
for as long as you want.

18:02.247 --> 18:04.750
I just don't feel
comfortable here right now.

18:04.792 --> 18:06.543
You don't feel
comfortable?

18:06.585 --> 18:08.295
What do you
think I'll do?

18:08.337 --> 18:10.672
No, it's not... I didn't
meant it like that.

18:10.714 --> 18:12.508
I...

18:12.549 --> 18:14.802
I just... I have
some things that I...

18:14.843 --> 18:16.386
I need to figure out.

18:18.180 --> 18:20.182
What things?

18:22.226 --> 18:25.771
Siobhan,
I hope you know,

18:25.813 --> 18:27.564
if what I told
you gets out,

18:27.606 --> 18:29.441
it'll affect
you as well.

18:29.483 --> 18:32.027
We've both spent money
from Martin/Charles.

18:33.737 --> 18:35.739
That's not what
this is about.

18:38.534 --> 18:40.202
I just need
a little time.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.921
[phone ringing]

18:50.963 --> 18:52.422
[chuckles]

18:52.464 --> 18:54.800
Hey. I was just thinking
about you.

18:54.842 --> 18:56.343
SIOBHAN:
I need your help.

18:56.385 --> 18:57.845
The flash drive
that I took from Andrew--

18:57.886 --> 18:59.596
Tyler stole it.

18:59.638 --> 19:01.306
I thought
he was helping you.

19:01.348 --> 19:02.724
I think he might be
getting cold feet.

19:02.766 --> 19:04.560
I found out he's going
to New York.

19:04.601 --> 19:06.186
I don't know if he's going
to the authorities

19:06.228 --> 19:07.896
or to Andrew or what.

19:07.938 --> 19:10.107
We have to control the way
that information gets out.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.650
I need you to get it back.

19:11.692 --> 19:13.902
OK. Any idea how?

19:13.944 --> 19:15.404
Well, I assume he's
going to be staying

19:15.445 --> 19:17.239
at the SoHo Diamond.

19:17.281 --> 19:18.949
That's where Martin/Charles
puts everyone.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.534
Break into his room,
pickpocket him--

19:20.576 --> 19:21.743
I don't care.

19:21.785 --> 19:23.162
Just get it back.

19:23.203 --> 19:24.913
Oh, take it easy.

19:24.955 --> 19:27.291
Take it easy.
I'll get it back.

19:27.332 --> 19:29.042
One more thing.

19:29.084 --> 19:30.544
I need you to keep
Bridget away from Tyler.

19:30.586 --> 19:32.629
Heh. OK.
Well, what are the chances

19:32.671 --> 19:34.506
that their paths
will cross?

19:34.548 --> 19:36.008
I'm not leaving anything
to chance.

19:36.049 --> 19:37.509
They met once before,

19:37.551 --> 19:39.052
and it almost
ruined everything.

19:39.094 --> 19:42.222
Well, I have some news
that might cheer you up.

19:42.264 --> 19:44.850
Malcolm came by today.

19:44.892 --> 19:46.476
What did he want?

19:46.518 --> 19:48.604
He wanted to talk
about Bridget.

19:48.645 --> 19:50.439
Apparently,
Andrew has a secret

19:50.480 --> 19:52.107
that he needs to protect.

19:52.149 --> 19:55.652
So I guess that Bridget knows
about the Ponzi scheme, right?

19:55.694 --> 19:57.863
That's... that's
what you wanted.

19:57.905 --> 19:59.198
That's good.

19:59.239 --> 20:00.407
But, um...

20:00.449 --> 20:02.075
he was also worried

20:02.117 --> 20:03.994
about what Andrew would do
to protect himself.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.955
He said that he thinks...

20:06.997 --> 20:10.292
he thinks Bridget's life
is in danger.

20:10.334 --> 20:12.628
That's not so good.

20:12.669 --> 20:15.047
Malcolm is getting way
too close to the truth.

20:15.088 --> 20:17.674
And we can't have him
around to protect Bridget.

20:19.301 --> 20:21.595
[sighs]
We need Malcolm gone.

20:21.637 --> 20:24.348
[phone ringing]

20:24.389 --> 20:26.183
Andrew Martin's office.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.060
Hey, Claudine.
It's Siobhan.

20:28.101 --> 20:29.561
I have a quick
question for you.

20:29.603 --> 20:31.146
Andrew mentioned

20:31.188 --> 20:32.898
that Tyler Barrett
was coming into town.

20:32.940 --> 20:34.983
We had such a nice
dinner last time.

20:35.025 --> 20:36.985
I was thinking I would
arrange another one.

20:37.027 --> 20:38.528
Oh, I'm happy to
make a reservation.

20:38.570 --> 20:39.738
Oh, no, no, no.
I don't want to bother you.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.657
I-I don't mind
doing it.

20:41.698 --> 20:43.825
I just need to know
where he's staying.

20:43.867 --> 20:46.328
The SoHo Diamond, arriving
tomorrow at noon.

20:46.370 --> 20:48.372
Perfect. Thank you.

20:57.673 --> 21:01.593
How long you been
with the ATF, Conroy?

21:01.635 --> 21:04.054
Going on two years now.

21:04.096 --> 21:06.473
So... what'd you do to
get put in the doghouse?

21:06.515 --> 21:08.642
Come on.

21:08.684 --> 21:11.603
Surveilling delivery
trucks is a crap detail.

21:11.645 --> 21:13.939
Torrance is showing
us who's boss.

21:13.981 --> 21:15.357
I worked with Torrance
in Cheyenne.

21:15.399 --> 21:18.610
He's got great instincts.

21:18.652 --> 21:20.487
Ah.

21:40.382 --> 21:42.050
What the hell happened?
You're 40 minutes late.

21:42.092 --> 21:44.553
I'm sorry.
Bodaway wanted a dance.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.558
I like it when
you get jealous.

21:49.599 --> 21:51.101
Jealous?
You think I...?

21:51.143 --> 21:52.394
That man's a psychopath.

21:56.064 --> 21:57.649
I don't like how close
you are to him.

21:57.691 --> 21:59.568
It's not safe.

21:59.609 --> 22:01.862
Well, not to point
fingers, Vic,

22:01.903 --> 22:04.031
but I only took this job
because of you.

22:04.072 --> 22:05.866
I know. I know.

22:05.907 --> 22:07.743
That's when you were
just another informant.

22:12.080 --> 22:13.874
Oh, yeah?

22:17.544 --> 22:19.463
And what am I now?

22:34.686 --> 22:36.063
I want you to quit.

22:36.104 --> 22:37.606
I have something
to tell you.

22:40.359 --> 22:41.526
You want me to quit?

22:41.568 --> 22:43.195
Whoa, whoa. What
were you gonna say?

22:43.236 --> 22:44.488
No, no.

22:44.529 --> 22:46.239
What is this
about quitting?

22:46.281 --> 22:47.491
I'm sick of being
worried about you.

22:47.532 --> 22:49.076
I want you to
quit. Tonight.

22:49.117 --> 22:50.285
Come on. We'll
hit the road.

22:50.327 --> 22:51.661
We'll just start over.

22:51.703 --> 22:53.205
Together.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.458
Well, what
about your career?

22:56.500 --> 22:57.918
Who cares about
my career?

22:57.959 --> 22:59.127
You're more important
than my career.

22:59.169 --> 23:01.129
I know you say that...

23:01.171 --> 23:03.048
but-but then you're gonna
regret it if you throw it

23:03.090 --> 23:04.716
all away for me,
and I don't...

23:04.758 --> 23:06.176
That's not how I want

23:06.218 --> 23:09.054
our life together to start.

23:09.096 --> 23:10.597
Look, you said

23:10.639 --> 23:14.101
that we're closer
than anyone's ever been

23:14.142 --> 23:16.144
to busting Bodaway.

23:18.355 --> 23:21.149
Let me go back tomorrow.

23:21.191 --> 23:24.236
He's having a party
in the basement.

23:24.277 --> 23:26.196
Usually no girls allowed.

23:26.238 --> 23:29.157
But he's asked Bridget
and me to dance.

23:29.199 --> 23:31.451
-Bridget, too?
-Yes.

23:31.493 --> 23:33.829
At least you know the
risk, but your friend...

23:35.664 --> 23:37.374
Let us do this.

23:37.416 --> 23:40.335
If we back out...

23:40.377 --> 23:42.504
it might make
Bodaway suspicious.

23:42.546 --> 23:44.131
You know that.

23:47.175 --> 23:49.010
One more time.
Then you're done.

23:49.052 --> 23:50.929
OK.

23:50.971 --> 23:52.681
That's fine by me.

23:55.016 --> 23:57.477
What was it you
wanted to tell me?

23:57.519 --> 23:59.062
Oh...

23:59.104 --> 24:00.480
It'll keep.

24:00.522 --> 24:01.773
Oh, come on.

24:01.815 --> 24:05.360
Don't worry.
It's nothing bad.

24:05.402 --> 24:06.945
[laughing]
It's not!

24:06.987 --> 24:08.738
It's not bad.

24:18.832 --> 24:21.334
RECEPTIONIST: Good morning,
Martin/Charles. May I help you?

24:21.376 --> 24:22.919
Give us a moment.

24:25.797 --> 24:27.674
I brought in an outside firm

24:27.716 --> 24:30.552
to examine
our security system.

24:30.594 --> 24:32.846
Did you know someone entered
three incorrect passwords

24:32.888 --> 24:35.765
in a row into
your computer last month?

24:35.807 --> 24:38.351
No. Did they get in?

24:38.393 --> 24:40.687
Not here, but we should,
uh, check your home system

24:40.729 --> 24:42.939
just to be sure.

24:42.981 --> 24:45.025
Andrew...

24:45.066 --> 24:46.610
did Siobhan tell you

24:46.651 --> 24:49.529
how she found out
about the Ponzi scheme?

24:49.571 --> 24:52.365
She's had suspicions
for a while.

24:52.407 --> 24:54.409
But you're not seriously
suggesting that my wife

24:54.451 --> 24:56.119
hacked our system?

24:56.161 --> 24:59.748
No. I know who did.
Malcolm Ward.

24:59.789 --> 25:01.416
But you said he
didn't get anything.

25:01.458 --> 25:03.043
Well, I was wrong.

25:03.084 --> 25:05.212
Malcolm was good at
covering his tracks.

25:05.253 --> 25:07.088
It's taken the techs all
morning, but they've

25:07.130 --> 25:09.674
discovered he accessed
a number of files,

25:09.716 --> 25:14.012
including a certain
algorithm on my desktop.

25:14.054 --> 25:15.305
[sighs]

25:15.347 --> 25:17.849
So you think that

25:17.891 --> 25:21.353
Malcolm found evidence
against us and told Siobhan?

25:21.394 --> 25:23.146
Well, it makes sense,
doesn't it?

25:23.188 --> 25:25.232
I just heard
from my source.

25:25.273 --> 25:27.817
Tyler Barrett has promised
the S.E.C. iron-clad proof

25:27.859 --> 25:30.278
of wrongdoing
at Martin/Charles.

25:30.320 --> 25:32.697
I'm off to deal
with him right now.

25:32.739 --> 25:34.449
While I'm gone, I trust

25:34.491 --> 25:36.284
you'll consider
our other situation.

25:36.326 --> 25:38.787
Because while Siobhan's
affection for you

25:38.828 --> 25:41.748
might be enough to
win her cooperation,

25:41.790 --> 25:44.167
what's motivating
Malcolm to keep silent?

betrayed my trust!

26:12.279 --> 26:14.656
Bridget, calm down.

26:14.698 --> 26:15.991
I was concerned.

26:16.032 --> 26:17.492
After our fight,
I wasn't sure...

26:17.534 --> 26:19.619
SIOBHAN: But you told
Henry about our fight?

26:19.661 --> 26:21.580
Why not just tell him
I'm Bridget?

26:21.621 --> 26:23.873
I would never do that!

26:23.915 --> 26:26.209
I only went to Henry
because he knew the truth

26:26.251 --> 26:27.961
about Martin/Charles
and Andrew.

26:28.003 --> 26:29.504
I'm trying to protect you.

26:29.546 --> 26:31.131
Spare me.

26:31.172 --> 26:32.340
I spent months trying to
get Henry out of my life,

26:32.382 --> 26:34.384
and now you
bring him back?

a part of.

26:41.391 --> 26:42.767
Bridget, if you
really think that,

26:42.809 --> 26:44.686
then you don't
know me at all.

26:44.728 --> 26:47.397
I know you're jealous.

34:07.128 --> 34:08.337
We can use
dental records.

34:08.379 --> 34:09.964
I-I need to see her.

34:26.230 --> 34:29.692
Yeah, that's, uh,
that's Shaylene Briggs.

34:29.734 --> 34:31.194
You knew her?

34:32.653 --> 34:35.948
She, uh, she was
my C.I.

34:35.990 --> 34:39.994
Sh-she went, she went
to a, uh...a party

34:40.036 --> 34:41.829
at Macawi's
two days ago.

34:41.871 --> 34:43.915
She just never
checked in afterward.

34:43.956 --> 34:45.124
[sniffles]

34:45.166 --> 34:47.877
Just, uh...

34:47.919 --> 34:49.629
do what you can
for her, please.

34:49.670 --> 34:51.589
You know, sh-she
doesn't have any family.

34:56.094 --> 34:58.262
Hey, Agent Machado?

34:58.304 --> 35:00.556
I doubt if this matters
to your case,

35:00.598 --> 35:03.309
but she was
four weeks' pregnant.

35:07.271 --> 35:09.857
What was it you
wanted to tell me?

35:09.899 --> 35:12.944
-Oh...it'll keep.
-Oh, come on.

35:12.985 --> 35:14.737
No, don't worry.

35:14.779 --> 35:16.781
It's nothing bad.

35:34.590 --> 35:36.551
[dialing]

35:36.592 --> 35:38.469
[line ringing]

35:43.432 --> 35:44.934
Tyler, what's going on?

35:44.976 --> 35:46.519
I screwed up,
Siobhan.

35:46.561 --> 35:48.563
What did you do?

35:48.604 --> 35:51.566
I-I went
to the S.E.C.

35:51.607 --> 35:53.818
What were you thinking?

35:53.860 --> 35:55.778
I was thinking
about us.

35:55.820 --> 35:57.363
I mean, we've been
collecting all
this evidence

35:57.405 --> 35:59.157
against Martin/Charles--
why not use it?

35:59.198 --> 36:02.076
Then we'd be free
to start our life
as a family.

36:02.118 --> 36:04.287
But none of that
matters anymore.

36:04.328 --> 36:06.455
Olivia got to me first.

36:06.497 --> 36:08.332
She knew everything.

36:08.374 --> 36:11.752
Tell me, does Olivia know
about you and me in Paris?

36:11.794 --> 36:13.171
No.

36:13.212 --> 36:14.755
I don't think so.

36:17.800 --> 36:20.094
But she knew
everything else.

36:20.136 --> 36:22.138
She has someone
inside the S.E.C.

36:26.309 --> 36:28.186
What are we gonna do,
Siobhan?

36:32.315 --> 36:34.650
Here we are, right
back where we started.

36:34.692 --> 36:36.277
Thank you.

36:42.992 --> 36:44.911
CABBIE:
Something wrong, lady?

36:44.952 --> 36:47.038
Just turn the meter on
but don't drive.

36:50.875 --> 36:52.793
[cell phone rings]

37:04.597 --> 37:06.224
ANDREW [recorded]:
It's me.

37:06.265 --> 37:08.392
I'm not sure what to say to you.

37:08.434 --> 37:10.645
I know this has been
a problem of my own making,

37:10.686 --> 37:13.898
and I have no right
to defend myself,

37:13.940 --> 37:16.776
but I wasn't the only one
keeping secrets, was I?

37:16.817 --> 37:19.153
I know you've been
in contact with Tyler Barrett.

37:19.195 --> 37:23.032
Siobhan, if the truth gets out,
I will lose everything--

37:23.074 --> 37:26.369
my company,
my friends, my daughter.

37:26.410 --> 37:28.454
I won't let you destroy my life.

37:34.752 --> 37:36.212
I'm so sorry, Siobhan.

37:36.254 --> 37:39.340
I... I should've
trusted you.

37:39.382 --> 37:42.760
Olivia and Andrew are
very dangerous people.

37:42.802 --> 37:45.429
Now you see what
I'm up against.

37:45.471 --> 37:47.932
Just tell me, how did you
leave things with Olivia?

37:47.974 --> 37:49.767
I gave her the files
I showed you

37:49.809 --> 37:51.602
but not the flash drive.

37:51.644 --> 37:53.020
Good.

37:53.062 --> 37:55.773
Don't let that flash drive
out of your sight.

37:55.815 --> 37:58.985
And get on the first flight
back to Paris.

37:59.026 --> 38:00.653
Paris.

38:12.331 --> 38:13.833
[door opens]

38:14.917 --> 38:16.377
[door closes]

38:19.505 --> 38:21.132
What the hell
are you doing here?

38:35.688 --> 38:37.189
[elevator bell dings]

38:39.734 --> 38:41.277
Mr. Jennings?

38:41.319 --> 38:42.778
Housekeeping.

38:42.820 --> 38:43.988
[lock beeps]

38:57.001 --> 38:58.586
[elevator bell dings]

39:08.763 --> 39:10.264
Tyler?

39:24.195 --> 39:26.280
[sirens]

39:30.826 --> 39:32.787
[tires screeching]

39:37.041 --> 39:38.626
-Just drive.
-Yes, ma'am.

39:38.667 --> 39:39.835
MAN: OK. Move in!

39:41.212 --> 39:43.339
[cell phone ringing]

39:43.381 --> 39:44.590
Yeah.

39:44.632 --> 39:46.092
MALCOLM: Agent Machado?

39:46.133 --> 39:48.344
It's Malcolm Ward.

39:48.386 --> 39:49.595
Malcolm.

39:49.637 --> 39:52.598
H-how can I help you?

39:52.640 --> 39:54.183
[line ringing]

39:54.225 --> 39:55.518
MALCOLM [recorded]:
You've reached Malcolm Ward.

39:55.559 --> 39:56.727
Please leave a message
at the tone.

39:56.769 --> 39:58.354
[beep]

39:58.396 --> 40:00.898
Malcolm, it's me.
I found Tyler.

40:00.940 --> 40:02.400
He's dead.

40:02.441 --> 40:04.985
I made an anonymous call
to the police.

40:07.279 --> 40:09.198
I've decided to press
charges against
Bodaway Macawi

40:09.240 --> 40:11.367
for kidnapping me.

40:11.409 --> 40:14.328
That's, uh, that's great.

40:14.370 --> 40:17.456
Uh, can I ask you
what changed your mind?

40:17.498 --> 40:18.958
Because last time
we spoke,

40:18.999 --> 40:21.544
you wouldn't even admit
you'd been abducted.

40:21.585 --> 40:24.213
I realized the only
reason Bridget went
on the run

40:24.255 --> 40:26.674
was because of Bodaway.

40:26.715 --> 40:28.676
Whatever kind of life
she's living now,

40:28.717 --> 40:31.846
wherever she is,
I can't imagine it's

40:31.887 --> 40:33.973
what she's planned
for herself.

40:34.014 --> 40:36.225
If Bridget doesn't feel
like she can testify,

40:36.267 --> 40:38.144
I will.

40:38.185 --> 40:39.728
Once Bodaway's
in jail,

40:39.770 --> 40:41.564
maybe she'll
finally feel like

40:41.605 --> 40:44.108
she can return
to her old life.

40:44.150 --> 40:49.029
Um, uh... I'm gonna
take care of you. OK?

40:49.071 --> 40:50.948
I want you to go straight
to the FBI Field Office

40:50.990 --> 40:52.658
in New York.

40:52.700 --> 40:54.285
I want you to wait there,

40:54.326 --> 40:55.494
and I'll be
on the next flight out.

40:55.536 --> 40:58.497
-OK.
-And, Malcolm, thank you.

41:07.715 --> 41:10.217
Malcolm, I think
you were right.

41:10.259 --> 41:15.556
I think Andrew and Olivia
might be capable of murder.

41:22.813 --> 41:24.815
[cell phone beeping]

41:34.825 --> 41:36.660
[knock on door]
