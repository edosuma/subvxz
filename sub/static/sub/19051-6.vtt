- V\/hoo, I feel good!

17:26.480 --> 17:29.768
- [ Mac] Yeah!
- We feel magnificent, yeah!

17:29.840 --> 17:33.401
And we can cure cancer
with plants.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.124
VVhoo! [ Dr. Jinx] Amen.

17:36.280 --> 17:38.089
Mmm. Thank you so much.
Thank you.

17:38.200 --> 17:39.770
Whoa. Whoa! Oh!

17:39.840 --> 17:41.410
Dennis, that was amazing, dude.

17:41.480 --> 17:44.165
I am so proud of you.
You are feeling again.

17:44.920 --> 17:46.081
No.

17:46.160 --> 17:48.083
I meant none of it.

17:48.160 --> 17:50.208
[ Door Opens ] [ Charlie ] Come on.
Come on.

17:50.280 --> 17:51.930
Just read the speech.

17:52.040 --> 17:53.883
I don't think I can do this.
You can do it.

17:53.960 --> 17:55.803
You'll be great.
My-My mom has a speech.

17:56.960 --> 17:58.485
“Thank you all for coming...

17:58.560 --> 18:01.291
to our beef and beer and Jesus.

18:01.360 --> 18:04.170
As you know,

18:04.240 --> 18:08.529
I'm as sick as a three-legged
dog on the streets of India.

18:08.600 --> 18:13.731
Any minute, my lungs are going to
sizzle, pop and disintegrate”-

18:13.840 --> 18:17.686
[ Mouths V\/ords ] “into a liquid
lung and organ gumbo soup.”

18:17.760 --> 18:19.888
That was my line.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.331
Nice.
Mmm.

18:21.440 --> 18:23.886
Charlie, I can't do this. Skip
to the money part, all right?

18:23.960 --> 18:25.450
Just get the money part done.

18:25.520 --> 18:28.330
“Give me money. Money me.

18:28.400 --> 18:29.925
Money now.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.049
Me a money needing
a lot now.”

18:33.160 --> 18:34.969
That was Charlie's line.
Yeah.

18:35.040 --> 18:37.441
- Eh.
- Charlie, I can't do this.

18:37.520 --> 18:39.124
Doing great.
We're doing great.

18:39.200 --> 18:41.806
I have a confession to make
to all of you.

18:41.880 --> 18:44.121
D0n”t do it, bitch!

18:44.200 --> 18:46.328
I don't have cancer!

18:46.440 --> 18:47.601
[All Gasp ] [ Mac ] What?

18:47.680 --> 18:49.728
- [ Mrs. Mac] Oh, God.
- [All Murmuring ]

18:52.120 --> 18:56.125
We're the ones that broke
the Virgin Mary statue.

18:56.200 --> 18:59.886
We accidentally hit
it with our car. Mmm.

18:59.960 --> 19:03.885
We were trying to raise money
to get it fixed.

19:03.960 --> 19:05.564
That's just crazy.

19:05.640 --> 19:08.120
You could've just told me the
story about hitting the statue.

19:08.200 --> 19:09.936
I mean, where did you come up
with this idea?

19:09.960 --> 19:13.760
Well, I learned everything
by watching you.

19:13.880 --> 19:16.685
Wh-Uh- Oh. Ah, shit.
I did do that, huh?

19:16.800 --> 19:18.245
Yeah, you totally-

19:18.360 --> 19:19.850
You pulled that shit on us too.
VVell-

19:19.960 --> 19:21.689
You son of a bitch.
That's no excuse.

19:21.760 --> 19:23.776
Well, at least you didn't
try and grift a doctor though.

19:23.800 --> 19:26.121
No, no. I never actually said
I was a doctor.

19:26.200 --> 19:28.601
[ Chuckles ] He's the
goddamn church gardener.

19:28.680 --> 19:31.809
A gardener? I guess that
would explain this.

19:31.880 --> 19:33.723
- [ Charlie ] Oh. Oh! - Jesus.

19:33.800 --> 19:35.776
I was gonna talk to you about that.
I'm really sorry.

19:35.800 --> 19:37.489
You had my back up against the wall.
I had

19:37.501 --> 19:39.282
to spray you with a heavy
dose of pesticide.

19:39.360 --> 19:42.728
Put some aloe vera gel on there,
a little bit of Vitamin D-

19:42.840 --> 19:44.205
What?
He doesn't know that.

19:44.320 --> 19:46.416
Don't get a diagnosis from him now.
How would you know that?

19:46.440 --> 19:47.521
Goddamn it.

19:47.600 --> 19:50.126
Dennis. Dennis!
Mom's alive.

19:50.240 --> 19:51.725
She faked her own death
to steal Frank's

19:51.737 --> 19:53.416
money, and we think it's
buried in her grave.

19:53.440 --> 19:54.930
That dirty whore.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.924
- [Whistles ] - Everybody
get a goddamn shovel!

19:58.000 --> 19:59.331
[ Digging ]

19:59.400 --> 20:03.450
This is such a perfect place
for that bitch to hide my money.

20:03.520 --> 20:05.045
Psychic John talked about this.

20:05.120 --> 20:07.856
He said I was gonna come into a
windfall of cash, and it's all in here.

20:07.880 --> 20:09.723
Yeah. Then we can use some
of that cash...

20:09.800 --> 20:11.776
to pay for the statue
that our moms broke, Charlie.

20:11.800 --> 20:15.043
All right!
[ Coughs ]

20:15.120 --> 20:17.327
- You guys ready?
- Crack it open, Charlie.

20:17.400 --> 20:19.607
[ Chanting ] Show me the money.
Show me the money!

20:19.680 --> 20:21.603
Show me the money!
Show me the money!

20:22.600 --> 20:24.409
[ Charlie ] Ah, shit! Oh, shit!

20:24.480 --> 20:25.925
[Screaming ]

20:26.000 --> 20:29.049
- Mommy! Mommy! - [
Cackles ] I grifted ya!

20:29.120 --> 20:31.726
- What are you talking about?
- I paid off the psychic.

20:31.840 --> 20:34.081
[ Dennis Shrieking ] I buried
the money in the dog grave.

20:34.160 --> 20:37.721
My mommy! My mommy's a skeleton!
[ Sobbing ]

20:37.840 --> 20:40.889
I grifted your asses good
because you said I was slipping.

20:40.960 --> 20:43.361
I feel too much!
I feel too much!

20:43.440 --> 20:47.001
You made me dig up my dead mother
because I said you were losing it?

20:47.080 --> 20:50.323
Score one for the old people!
[ Cackles ]

20:51.520 --> 20:53.329
Wait a minute.

20:53.400 --> 20:55.243
What the hell happened
to my shoes?
