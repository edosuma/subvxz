to be brave right now, ok?

Where's your dad now?

02:10.639 --> 02:11.890

the door.

03:54.460 --> 03:56.761

the hidden threat.

03:56.829 --> 03:58.413
I should have covered him.

03:58.498 --> 03:59.865
No, Prentiss.
You're on point.

03:59.916 --> 04:01.283
It's his job
to cover you.

04:01.367 --> 04:03.752
And when you don't
do your job, Valdez, people die.

04:03.836 --> 04:06.404
Now, if you're not ready
to shoulder that responsibility,

04:06.456 --> 04:09.291
then maybe you need
to reconsider joining the Bureau.

04:11.711 --> 04:13.845
I said I was sorry,
all right?

04:18.935 --> 04:20.584

But out in the field,

04:20.636 --> 04:23.722
sorry doesn't
bring people back.

on Valdez.

Well, he looks up to you.

04:56.005 --> 04:58.623
I'm just saying, maybe
you could build his confidence,

04:58.674 --> 05:00.025
not break it.

05:00.092 --> 05:03.011
Imagine how he'd feel
if that had been real.

05:03.095 --> 05:04.708
Ok, yeah, I understand that.

05:04.733 --> 05:08.184
But that course is designed
to force failure.

05:08.935 --> 05:10.301
That's how we learn.

05:10.353 --> 05:12.837
And my job is to train
the trainees, not to be their friend.

05:12.905 --> 05:16.307

the tough love thing,

05:16.359 --> 05:18.610

Exact same M.O.
both houses were burgled,

05:30.289 --> 05:32.757
power and phone lines cut, and they
broke in through a back window.

05:32.825 --> 05:35.159
In each case the entire family
was shot and killed?

05:35.211 --> 05:37.379
Yes, that is right.
I present to you

05:37.463 --> 05:39.464
the Mitchells
and the Lewis family.

05:39.515 --> 05:41.917
They took out the power
and phones to isolate them.

05:41.984 --> 05:44.803
The alarm systems wouldn't work
and they can't call for help.

05:44.854 --> 05:47.522
Most modern alarm systems
have a backup generator

05:47.607 --> 05:49.691
and a cell phone connection
to the security company.

05:49.775 --> 05:51.860
Yeah, but the Mitchells
had an older system,

05:51.944 --> 05:55.063
and the Lewises were behind
on their account, so it was inactive.

05:55.147 --> 05:56.698
An assailant was killed
in each case?

05:56.782 --> 05:58.567
Affirmative. But the sheriff
hasn't I.D.'d them yet.

05:58.651 --> 06:00.302
So both families were armed
and fought back

06:00.369 --> 06:02.804
and shot one of
their attackers.

06:02.872 --> 06:04.956
Is that a coincidence
or a connection?

06:05.024 --> 06:06.458
What concerns me
is the frequency of the kills.

were on the other side of town,

The M.E. didn't see
any signs of a struggle,

09:35.079 --> 09:36.663
so he obviously dealt
with her rather quickly.

that the rest

was shot with
the exact same .357.

there was only one shooter.

were Trisha Lewis

09:48.458 --> 09:50.459

confronting Underwood.

10:40.811 --> 10:42.628
It wasn't a secret.

10:42.696 --> 10:46.115
The boy was wild. Been that way
since his mother passed.

10:46.150 --> 10:48.451
Too much of his daddy
in him.

10:48.518 --> 10:49.902
So he was always in trouble?

10:49.987 --> 10:52.205
Not FBI trouble.

10:52.289 --> 10:56.209
He ain't got the brains
nor the work ethic.

10:56.276 --> 10:58.411
Kids have a way
of hiding things.

10:58.495 --> 11:00.096
Agent Hotchner,

11:00.164 --> 11:01.864
the boy smoked reefer,

11:01.915 --> 11:04.300
ran with the wrong crowd.

11:04.368 --> 11:06.702
Most of his time
was spent on a stoop

11:06.770 --> 11:09.472
or in front of a TV.

11:09.539 --> 11:12.308
I'm telling you, ain't no way
on God's green earth

11:12.375 --> 11:14.761
he did what they say
he did.

11:14.845 --> 11:18.648
When was the last time
you saw Ronald?

11:18.715 --> 11:21.000
The night before last.

11:21.068 --> 11:24.537
He came home from work,

11:24.605 --> 11:26.956
and he was running late
for class.

11:27.024 --> 11:30.209
I left him a plate.

11:30.277 --> 11:33.496
But when I found it there
the next morning,

11:33.563 --> 11:36.565
I knew something was wrong.

11:43.207 --> 11:45.241
Does he look familiar?

11:45.292 --> 11:49.145
No. Never seen him.

11:49.213 --> 11:54.016
Were you aware of any gang affiliation
your son may have had?

11:54.084 --> 11:57.770
Gang? No.

11:57.855 --> 11:59.588
It could have been just a friend
in the neighborhood--

11:59.640 --> 12:01.607
I said no.

12:01.692 --> 12:02.608
Ok.

12:02.693 --> 12:05.278
Have you never known him
to do drugs?

12:05.345 --> 12:08.030
Excuse me?

12:08.098 --> 12:11.367
Ma'am, look, I'm very sorry.
I know this is very--

12:11.434 --> 12:14.320
so you think
because he was black

12:14.404 --> 12:17.657
and had tattoos,
that he was in a gang

12:17.741 --> 12:19.659
and doing drugs?

12:21.745 --> 12:24.881
The medical examiner
found opiates in his system.

12:24.948 --> 12:26.048
[Gasps]

12:26.116 --> 12:29.051
The other dead assailant
was a known gang member.

12:29.119 --> 12:31.624
Ma'am, I am just
trying to gain insight

12:31.649 --> 12:32.849
into who your son was.

12:33.957 --> 12:37.727
Well, here's some insight.

12:37.794 --> 12:40.433
My son worked two jobs

12:40.458 --> 12:42.714
so he could put himself
through school.

12:43.133 --> 12:48.171
He was no thug
on the corner!

12:48.238 --> 12:52.909
My baby, he would never
have done these things.

12:52.976 --> 12:54.827
Do you understand me?

12:59.116 --> 13:04.504
You find out who did this
to him.

13:04.588 --> 13:09.642
Ok, so the unsub
gets the drop on Matt Lewis,

13:09.710 --> 13:11.844
kills the rest of the family,

13:11.929 --> 13:15.047
and then leaves a drugged-up
patsy behind

13:15.132 --> 13:16.933
to cover his tracks?

13:17.000 --> 13:18.267
This wasn't a burglary
at all.

13:18.335 --> 13:19.785
There was a higher
purpose here.

13:19.853 --> 13:22.071
They're staging the crime scene
as some kind of message.

13:22.139 --> 13:24.223
This guy's trying to make it look
like black kids from the hood

13:24.308 --> 13:26.508
are killing white families
in white neighborhoods.

13:26.560 --> 13:28.528
A pretty powerful
message.

13:28.612 --> 13:30.780
Homes are being invaded.

13:30.847 --> 13:33.533
Entire families are being
slaughtered by common criminals.

13:33.617 --> 13:36.569
I ask you, Mayor Wennington,
what are you doing about it?

13:36.637 --> 13:38.193
Because, frankly, sir,
from where I'm standing

13:38.218 --> 13:39.418
it doesn't seem like enough.

13:39.456 --> 13:40.923
I'd like to respond to that.

13:40.991 --> 13:42.542
- I should hope so,
- Oh, please.

13:42.626 --> 13:44.360
because crime rates have been on
the rise ever since you took office.

13:44.428 --> 13:47.413
And so have property taxes,
I might add.

13:47.497 --> 13:49.048
And how about you, Ms. Ross?

13:49.132 --> 13:50.729
If you take office,
do you have a plan to curb

13:50.754 --> 13:51.954
the violence on our streets?

13:52.135 --> 13:54.303
I do. I will be happy
to discuss it.

13:54.371 --> 13:58.674
The victims of these heinous
crimes fought back. Why?

13:58.759 --> 14:01.294
Because no one would
fight back for them.

14:01.361 --> 14:03.646
But if you elect me, I will.

14:03.713 --> 14:06.265
I won't let this become
another Los Angeles,

14:06.350 --> 14:09.902
where the cancer of black and
Latino gangs has taken over.

14:09.987 --> 14:13.773
Or Salt Lake, where 80%
of drug-related felonies

14:13.857 --> 14:17.193
is committed by illegals.

14:17.244 --> 14:20.746
This is our city.
It's time we take it back.

14:24.501 --> 14:25.835
[Speaking spanish]

14:25.902 --> 14:27.336
Vamonos.

14:38.581 --> 14:40.466
Solo quiero uno de ustedes.

14:40.550 --> 14:43.803
Necesito ayuda
para mudarme.

14:43.887 --> 14:46.922
Cincuenta dolares
por dos horas.

14:46.974 --> 14:49.091
[Speaking spanish]

14:49.142 --> 14:50.610
Si.

14:50.694 --> 14:52.862
[Pats seat]

15:00.454 --> 15:02.154
¿De donde eres?

15:02.239 --> 15:04.323
De Guadalajara.

15:04.408 --> 15:07.410
Ah. Estas lejos de casa.

15:07.461 --> 15:10.763
Esperame un momento.
Tengo que sacar algo de baul.

15:49.917 --> 15:52.168
Same exact M.O.
power and phone lines were cut,

15:52.252 --> 15:53.669
and he snuck in
through a back window.

15:53.754 --> 15:54.837
He's accelerating.

15:54.922 --> 15:57.840
Less than two days
since the last break-in.

15:57.925 --> 15:59.342
He was Pedro Mendez.

15:59.426 --> 16:01.177
He had a Mexican
driver's license on him.

16:01.261 --> 16:02.478
Garcia checked him out.

16:02.563 --> 16:04.146
Wife, 3 kids.

16:04.231 --> 16:05.631
No criminal record.

16:05.682 --> 16:07.683
6 gunshot wounds
to the chest and head.

16:07.768 --> 16:11.020
It looks they were all from
a .38 snub-nose.

16:11.104 --> 16:13.973
And then over here...

16:14.024 --> 16:17.493
Charles Nelson.
.38 was registered in his name.

16:17.578 --> 16:20.112
He unloaded the entire
cylinder on that guy.

16:20.163 --> 16:21.664
Or we're supposed to think.

16:21.748 --> 16:23.032
Where's the other body?

16:23.116 --> 16:25.918
Upstairs.

16:40.851 --> 16:42.134
Karen Nelson.

16:42.185 --> 16:43.636
She was due in a month.

16:43.687 --> 16:46.555
Well, he took the time to pull
the sheet up and tuck her in.

16:46.640 --> 16:47.607
Remorse.

16:47.674 --> 16:51.010
Well, that would be
a first. Why now?

16:51.061 --> 16:53.946
The homeowners in each case
were killed humanely.

16:54.014 --> 16:55.898
He didn't want them to suffer.

16:55.983 --> 16:57.349
But the fall guys
he left behind

16:57.401 --> 16:59.902
were all shot multiple times--
overkill, like it was personal.

16:59.987 --> 17:01.921
But he modified his M.O.

17:01.989 --> 17:03.895
This time he wanted it
to look like an undocumented

17:03.896 --> 17:05.659
immigrant was responsible.

17:05.709 --> 17:07.460
These are hate crimes.

17:07.527 --> 17:10.546
And the point is to incite
racial tension and fear.

17:13.165 --> 17:15.166
We believe we're looking
for a white male

17:15.218 --> 17:16.642
in his late 20s
to early 30s.

17:16.643 --> 17:17.320
Wait, wait, wait.

17:17.346 --> 17:18.829
I'm sorry, I thought
we were looking

17:18.872 --> 17:19.972
at black gangbangers.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.490
The unsub has been staging
the crime scenes

17:21.558 --> 17:23.976
to make it look like black gangs
and undocumented immigrants

17:24.044 --> 17:24.993
were responsible.

17:25.061 --> 17:27.262
Why would anyone do that?

17:27.347 --> 17:29.982
We think he's trying to create
some sort of racial conflict.

17:30.050 --> 17:31.927
In 1969, Charles Manson
orchestrated

17:31.952 --> 17:34.060
the Tate-la Bianca murders
in the hopes of creating

17:34.061 --> 17:35.870
a race war between
the blacks and whites

17:35.889 --> 17:38.007
that he referred to
as Helter Skelter.

17:38.075 --> 17:39.508
A name he stole
from a Beatles song.

17:39.576 --> 17:41.327
Members of the Manson family
left watermelon rinds

17:41.394 --> 17:43.703
at the scene of the crime
and also painted panther

17:43.728 --> 17:44.928
paws on the wall in blood

17:45.499 --> 17:46.999
in the hopes of
convincing authorities

17:47.067 --> 17:49.518
that the Black Panther
Party was responsible.

17:49.586 --> 17:50.836
Hate groups like
the Aryan Nation

17:50.904 --> 17:52.455
believe that race war
is not only inevitable,

17:52.539 --> 17:53.839
but necessary.

17:53.907 --> 17:56.509
Our unsub may be a member
of one of these groups.

17:56.576 --> 17:59.011
Aryan gangs have a strong
presence in prisons,

17:59.079 --> 18:02.298
so he may be an ex-con or even
possibly related to a convict.

18:02.382 --> 18:04.750
Rossi: We think he may also
be some kind of zealot.

18:04.801 --> 18:07.186
He believes his war
is already being fought.

18:07.254 --> 18:09.188
And these murders
are a mission to him.

18:09.255 --> 18:12.108
And like a soldier, he is willing
to put himself in harm's way.

18:12.192 --> 18:14.777
Reid: The unsub may also
be vulnerable somehow--

18:14.861 --> 18:16.696
weakminded or even lonely.

18:16.763 --> 18:19.732
His cause gives him a sense
of power and belonging.

18:19.783 --> 18:21.319
He's physically fit enough
to move dead bodies,

18:21.344 --> 18:22.602
so he's probably young.

18:22.703 --> 18:24.787
But not so young
as to be impulsive.

18:24.871 --> 18:26.815
These attacks took
planning and focus.

18:26.840 --> 18:28.191
So, he's disciplined.

18:28.291 --> 18:31.877
He uses Oxycodone to drug
his unwilling partners.

18:31.945 --> 18:33.295
But he does so
without killing them,

18:33.380 --> 18:35.631
which means he's knowledgeable
about dosages.

18:35.716 --> 18:37.984
And Oxy is expensive,
so look at medical care

18:38.009 --> 18:39.666
professionals and caregivers,

18:39.720 --> 18:42.054
anyone with access
to prescription drugs.

18:42.122 --> 18:44.056
This unsub is
dedicated and driven.

18:44.124 --> 18:46.175
It makes him
especially dangerous.

18:46.259 --> 18:48.861
Surrender is not likely
part of his strategy.

18:48.929 --> 18:51.480

18:59.606 --> 19:01.240

19:05.278 --> 19:06.412
Yeah, me, too.

a new mattress.

oatmeal. Put in brown sugar.

19:14.004 --> 19:15.287
I know how you like it.

19:15.338 --> 19:16.655
Here's a quick look
at what we can expect

19:16.706 --> 19:18.624
the 5-day forecast
to look like.

19:18.675 --> 19:21.343
As you can see, it will be slightly
on the cooler side of average,

19:21.428 --> 19:24.296
with temps in the mid- to upper 50s
with partly cloudy skies...

19:24.347 --> 19:28.350
Eggs? Mom,
do you want eggs?

19:28.435 --> 19:29.351
[Grunts]

19:29.436 --> 19:31.554
Yeah?

19:31.638 --> 19:32.411
Yeah.

19:32.436 --> 19:33.606
So don't put away those
winter jackets just yet.

19:33.607 --> 19:35.641
Back to you guys
in the studio.

19:35.692 --> 19:37.610
And with the mayoral race
heating up,

19:37.677 --> 19:39.812
Clark Preston took time
to walk the neighborhood

19:39.863 --> 19:42.731
recently hit by two brutal
home invasions.

19:42.816 --> 19:44.400
I'm here to support
my community.

19:44.484 --> 19:46.485
These people need to know
that they're not alone.

19:46.536 --> 19:48.954
Mr. Preston, what do you plan
to do about it if elected?

19:49.022 --> 19:50.372
What do I plan to do?

19:50.457 --> 19:51.824
These people ask
the dumbest questions.

19:51.875 --> 19:54.210
I plan to cut these
gangs out like a tumor.

19:54.294 --> 19:56.712
We won't be terrorized
in our own homes.

to door to personally

Hey, Hotch.
Check this out.

20:26.743 --> 20:28.119
There's a mayoral race
in town, and there's

20:28.144 --> 20:29.786
a guy named Clark Preston
all over the news.

20:30.942 --> 20:32.410
Looks like he's running
a close second.

20:33.533 --> 20:36.452
These vicious home invasions
are a sign of the times.

20:36.536 --> 20:39.922
As demographics change,
so do crime rates.

20:40.006 --> 20:42.458
Now, we may not be able
to slow the Browning of America,

20:42.542 --> 20:44.376
but we can sure as hell
take our city back.

20:44.427 --> 20:46.795
And if you elect me,
I'll lead that charge.

20:46.880 --> 20:48.130
The Browning of America?

20:48.215 --> 20:50.366
That's damn near
hate speech.

20:50.433 --> 20:52.051
He's using the murders
to further his campaign

20:52.102 --> 20:53.636
and I guess people
are rallying behind it.

20:53.720 --> 20:56.305
So what if our unsub
is nothing like Manson?

20:56.389 --> 20:57.556
Manson never got
his hands dirty.

20:57.607 --> 20:59.441
What if our unsub
is more like his followers?

20:59.526 --> 21:01.110
You think he's being
manipulated?

21:01.194 --> 21:03.112
Maybe even unintentionally,
but either way,

21:03.196 --> 21:04.880
rhetoric like this
could fuel his fire.

21:04.948 --> 21:06.565
We should talk to Preston.

21:06.616 --> 21:07.766
I already sent a car.

21:07.817 --> 21:09.201
Good.

21:09.269 --> 21:11.954
I can't tell you how happy I am
you're here, gentlemen.

21:12.038 --> 21:14.306
Maybe now someone
will stop these savages.

21:14.374 --> 21:16.592
What can I do to help?

21:16.660 --> 21:18.777
We were hoping to talk to you
about some of your rhetoric.

21:18.845 --> 21:20.162
My rhetoric.

21:20.247 --> 21:22.681
We believe the recent murders
may be hate crimes.

21:22.749 --> 21:24.683
Some of the things you say,

21:24.751 --> 21:27.386
well, they may be construed
as inflammatory.

21:27.453 --> 21:30.222
Agent Morgan's referring to some of
your recent campaign speeches

21:30.290 --> 21:32.224
and the references
to the murders.

21:32.292 --> 21:34.567
We believe that whoever's
responsible for these crimes

21:34.592 --> 21:35.792
is impressionable

21:35.845 --> 21:37.730
and may be responding
to the vitriol.

21:37.797 --> 21:38.714
You think
I'm responsible?

21:38.782 --> 21:40.733
Nobody said that.

21:40.800 --> 21:45.020
If this person is motivated
by racist sentiments,

21:45.105 --> 21:48.274
then what you're saying
publicly may be affecting him.

21:49.759 --> 21:51.193
You're profilers, right?

21:51.278 --> 21:52.361
Right.

21:52.445 --> 21:54.363
You study behavior,
not actual facts.

21:54.447 --> 21:56.498
And then you come up
with theories.

21:56.583 --> 22:00.286
It's not quite
as simple as that.

22:03.907 --> 22:06.609
I'll bet you had to work extra hard
to get in the Bureau, didn't you?

22:06.676 --> 22:10.212
Probably still have to
prove yourself on a regular basis.

22:10.280 --> 22:13.449
I respect that.

22:13.516 --> 22:15.601
I wish there were more
like you.

22:18.305 --> 22:21.724
I'll cut back on my media
appearances, for now.

22:21.808 --> 22:25.728
But I suggest you start proving
some of those theories of yours.

22:25.812 --> 22:27.980
You two enjoy your day.

22:30.951 --> 22:34.536
We should check out his list
of contributors and his staff.

22:34.604 --> 22:36.205
It might be somebody
in his camp.

22:36.289 --> 22:39.258
We need to check him out, too.

22:39.326 --> 22:41.210
I'll send it first thing Monday.

22:41.278 --> 22:43.695
Yes, yes, yes.

Clark! Ah, good
to see you, man.

23:00.096 --> 23:01.513
Hey, those debates
the other day--

23:01.564 --> 23:03.148
you were great!

23:03.216 --> 23:05.934
Thanks. I'm sorry I couldn't
swing by after like we planned.

23:06.002 --> 23:08.270
Oh, no, no, no.
I get it.

23:08.355 --> 23:11.556
I mean, it's not like you're running
for mayor or anything. Right?

23:11.608 --> 23:13.108
I brought these
for your mom.

23:13.176 --> 23:14.693
It's her birthday
next week, right?

23:14.744 --> 23:16.895
You always remember.

23:16.946 --> 23:19.198
Hey, uh, you hungry?
I'm fixing lunch.

23:19.249 --> 23:20.666
You could come in and say hi.
She'd love to see you.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.401
Honest, I wish
I had the time.

23:22.452 --> 23:23.836
I'm just
in the neighborhood.

23:23.903 --> 23:24.953
But you give her
my love.

23:25.021 --> 23:25.954
You bet.

23:26.039 --> 23:27.840
Hey, listen.
About the campaigning,

23:27.907 --> 23:30.292
I'm thinking maybe
we down-shift a little bit.

23:30.360 --> 23:32.845
[Chuckles, clears throat]

23:32.912 --> 23:34.963
Have you seen the polls?
We're losing.

23:35.048 --> 23:37.016
I know. Still a lot
of work to do.

23:37.083 --> 23:39.518
Yeah, but we're changing minds,
just like you said.

23:39.585 --> 23:41.203
And we'll keep
changing them.

23:41.271 --> 23:43.255
But it's a chess game,
Trev.

23:43.306 --> 23:45.307
We gotta time our moves.

[Cell phone rings]

24:11.918 --> 24:13.919
Hey, talk to me, dollface.

24:13.970 --> 24:16.138
I got some dirt on your
mayoral candidate, Clark Preston.

24:16.222 --> 24:18.457
He's a politician.
That shouldn't be hard.

24:18.508 --> 24:19.958
Yeah, he's
a real estate lawyer

24:20.009 --> 24:21.977
who ran for city council
last year and lost.

24:22.062 --> 24:23.462
And he's rich.

24:23.513 --> 24:25.597
As in, if money
was dirt, he's filthy.

24:25.648 --> 24:29.151
Uh, he quadrupled his net worth
in the last 10 years,

24:29.235 --> 24:30.652
mostly from real estate.

24:30.737 --> 24:33.138
So he managed to thrive despite
the area's economic downturn.

24:33.189 --> 24:34.323
What do you mean
by mostly?

24:34.407 --> 24:35.807
Well, he is on the board

24:35.859 --> 24:38.143
of several shadow
financial institutions.

24:38.194 --> 24:39.661
Hedge funds, pension funds.

24:39.729 --> 24:42.464
Oh, he likes to shuffle
his money around.

24:42.532 --> 24:45.167
Even found some offshore
accounts of his, I did.

24:45.251 --> 24:46.535
You only do that
if you're trying to hide it.

24:46.603 --> 24:49.121
What about his staff
and contributors.

Uh-uh. No,
they're all clean.

- All right, thanks, Garcia.
- Yeah.

24:54.627 --> 24:57.329
[Sighs] Preston's
a part of this.

24:57.380 --> 24:59.498
I know he is. You should have
seen him in there.

24:59.549 --> 25:02.801
He's a racist
and a little shady, maybe,

25:02.852 --> 25:04.520
but a murderer?

25:04.604 --> 25:06.805
It may be just a feeling,
but I know he's in this.

just like all the others.

26:39.835 --> 26:41.903
Why put him in there?

26:41.970 --> 26:44.122
There must be something
symbolically important.

26:44.206 --> 26:45.873
There's something
inconsistent about the staging.

26:45.941 --> 26:48.294
It's not remorse,
and it's not a forensic

26:48.319 --> 26:49.160
countermeasure either.

26:49.161 --> 26:52.013
Each of these families
were registered gun owners.

26:52.080 --> 26:54.465
That must be how he's
selecting his victims.

26:54.550 --> 26:56.250
He wants them
to fight back.

26:56.318 --> 26:58.553
It's propaganda
for his race war.

26:58.604 --> 27:00.605
He's turning the families
into martyrs.

27:00.689 --> 27:03.725
And the fall guy
takes the blame.

27:03.776 --> 27:05.259
But now he's lost control

27:05.327 --> 27:08.262
because his fall guy
got away, and he's devolving.

27:08.313 --> 27:09.630
His name's Ramon Gomez.

27:09.698 --> 27:11.599
He's an undocumented
immigrant from Mexico City.

freaked out.

27:13.235 --> 27:15.069

a description of the unsub?

tracks here.

Now, given the time
and distance parameters,

there's no way the unsub
could have ventured

outside this radius.

he heard laughter and loud music.

next to the train tracks

that would have been closed,

the Drunken Dog.

the drinking type.

Let's see. Uh, it's been
around 30 years.

30:21.890 --> 30:24.825
It was opened by a warehouse
worker named Manny Gresham.

30:24.893 --> 30:26.260
Upon his death
6 years ago,

30:26.311 --> 30:28.980
it was bought by a hedge fund
company called First Advantage.

30:29.064 --> 30:31.298
Why would a hedge fund
company want a bar?

30:31.350 --> 30:32.800

they bought it for a song,

expenses bankrupted him.

of First Advantage,

is on a short list

has healing to do.

and time to fix.

and 10-year-old Julie were killed.

32:33.872 --> 32:38.042

she has a lot of brain damage

in a near vegetative state.

and when it was over,

32:51.485 --> 32:52.056
he called 911.

32:52.057 --> 32:53.691
Hotch: That's why
he stuffed that boy in the closet.

32:53.759 --> 32:55.459
He was reliving
his own victimization.

32:55.527 --> 32:57.094
He didn't do that to th
other children he murdered

32:57.162 --> 32:58.462
because he didn't
relate to them.

32:58.547 --> 33:00.815
Garcia, was anybody
convicted of the crime?

33:00.882 --> 33:04.001
Yes. A Ronnie Green
and Carlos Jackson.

33:04.086 --> 33:06.804
They're both African American,
both serving life in Folsom.

33:06.872 --> 33:08.455
And then after the murders,

33:08.507 --> 33:11.959
Preston, he financially supported
the family almost entirely.

33:12.010 --> 33:14.478
So they're close.
He's known the family for years.

33:14.563 --> 33:16.630
That must be how they're paying
Pamela's medical expenses.

33:16.681 --> 33:18.571
It would be awfully hard
to cover that on a part-time

it's a top-flight policy.

33:21.586 --> 33:23.471
Rossi: So Preston
is playing the savior.

33:23.538 --> 33:26.473
And it looks like
that monthly donation

33:26.525 --> 33:28.993
that Pamela makes
to Preston's campaign

33:29.077 --> 33:30.861
is her disability check.

33:30.929 --> 33:32.997
My guess is Trevor
authorized that

33:33.081 --> 33:34.481
because he feels
beholden to Preston.

33:34.533 --> 33:36.150
He probably idolizes him.

33:36.201 --> 33:38.986
So Prestons manipulating the Mills
family to further his own agenda.

33:39.037 --> 33:40.838
He's behind everything.

33:40.922 --> 33:42.823
He took advantage of Trevor
when he was weak and vulnerable.

33:42.874 --> 33:44.758
He gains his trust,
then he brainwashes him.

33:45.038 --> 33:46.038
Turn him into a killer.

33:46.044 --> 33:48.379
Uh, guys
there's something else.

33:50.932 --> 33:53.333
[Tires screech]

33:58.924 --> 34:00.724
[Pounding on door]

34:00.792 --> 34:02.743
Hotch: FBI!

34:20.411 --> 34:22.862
Pamela Mills?

34:25.533 --> 34:27.585
House is empty.
He's not here,

34:27.668 --> 34:29.136
but I found this
in his bedroom.

34:29.204 --> 34:30.571
It's addressed to her.

34:30.639 --> 34:32.556
"The price of peace
is sacrifice.

34:32.641 --> 34:35.525
"And I'm prepared to pay that price,
no matter how high.

34:35.594 --> 34:37.228
I hope you'll
still love me."

34:37.312 --> 34:38.728
This is a good-bye letter.

34:38.813 --> 34:40.313
Or a suicide note.

34:40.380 --> 34:42.315
He doesn't profile
as suicidal.

34:42.382 --> 34:44.301
No, but he knows
this could be his final mission.

34:44.369 --> 34:47.071
He may want to go out
in a blaze of glory.

34:47.155 --> 34:50.456
It's all about the election.
He's only got one move left.

34:50.525 --> 34:52.443
We need to secure
Mayor Wennington.

34:52.527 --> 34:54.612
Have the rest of the team
find Hilary Ross.

34:56.014 --> 34:58.582
[Opera playing,
Hilary Ross humming along]

34:58.667 --> 35:01.502
[Cell phone vibrating]

35:08.710 --> 35:11.045
Mmm.

35:26.537 --> 35:27.987
[Glass shatters]

35:45.250 --> 35:49.120
[Cell phone vibrating]

35:50.316 --> 35:52.034
Hello. You have
reached Hilary Ross.

35:52.118 --> 35:53.902
Please leave
a detailed message.

35:53.987 --> 35:54.903
She's still not answering.

35:54.988 --> 35:56.438
[Cell phone rings]

35:56.506 --> 35:57.706
Yeah, Morgan.

35:57.774 --> 35:59.575
We're on our way
to Hilary Ross' house now.

35:59.659 --> 36:01.110
She's still not
answering her phone.

36:01.177 --> 36:03.162
All right, call local police.
He's not going to go quietly.

36:03.213 --> 36:04.546
Do you have
Mayor Wennington?

36:04.631 --> 36:06.331
Yeah. Keep me posted.

36:06.383 --> 36:07.916
You got it.

36:15.392 --> 36:17.176
Hello. You've reached
Hilary Ross.

36:17.227 --> 36:18.227
I'm still getting nothing.

36:18.311 --> 36:19.377
That's her car.

36:19.429 --> 36:20.679
All right,
you two go around back.

36:20.730 --> 36:22.380
I'll draw his fire
while you flank him.

36:22.432 --> 36:24.016
You sure
you want to split up?

36:24.067 --> 36:27.319
We gotta cover the back and
the front in case he runs. Let's go.

36:42.669 --> 36:44.119
[Screaming]

36:44.204 --> 36:46.571
[Trevor grunting]

36:46.623 --> 36:48.257
Aah!
[Indistinct]

36:51.961 --> 36:54.096
[Gasping]

36:55.098 --> 36:56.882
Aah!

37:00.770 --> 37:02.721
FBI!

37:02.772 --> 37:05.641
Ohh! Oh!

37:05.725 --> 37:06.642
You're hit!

37:06.709 --> 37:07.810
I'm good. Go, go!

37:10.363 --> 37:12.898
JJ: He's upstairs.

37:23.776 --> 37:26.462
[Hilary screaming]

37:31.751 --> 37:33.335
Aah!
Get in here!

37:33.419 --> 37:35.721
Trevor Mills! FBI!

37:35.788 --> 37:37.172
Drop the weapon!
It's over!

37:37.257 --> 37:39.057
Aah! Aah!

37:39.125 --> 37:40.642
Get away from me!

37:40.727 --> 37:41.643
[Whimpering]

37:41.728 --> 37:43.829
Trevor, you don't
want to do this.

37:43.897 --> 37:45.013
Let me help you
or you're gonna die.

37:45.098 --> 37:47.132
You help me?
Yeah, right!

37:47.183 --> 37:48.383
I know about Preston.

37:48.451 --> 37:50.486
I know that he put you
up to all of this.

37:50.570 --> 37:52.804
You damn half-breed!

37:52.856 --> 37:55.023
You don't know anything!

37:55.108 --> 37:57.409
Trevor, we pulled
your phone records.

37:57.476 --> 37:59.611
You called Preston
13 times today.

37:59.662 --> 38:00.612
So what?!

38:00.663 --> 38:03.248
We pulled his voicemail
messages, too.

38:03.316 --> 38:06.068
He's using you, kid. That's why
he won't call you back.

38:06.136 --> 38:07.986
Get out of here
or I'll kill this bitch!

38:08.037 --> 38:09.705
Listen to me.
Just listen.

38:09.789 --> 38:11.707
When those men
broke in your house,

38:11.791 --> 38:14.009
you know who ended up
buying it?

38:14.093 --> 38:15.677
It was your man Preston.

38:15.762 --> 38:18.096
And he got it for nothing.

38:18.164 --> 38:19.497
You're a liar!

38:19.549 --> 38:22.667
All you people do
is you lie!

38:22.719 --> 38:24.686
The men convicted
of killing your family,

38:24.771 --> 38:27.639
they both said somebody
paid them off to do that job.

38:27.690 --> 38:29.141
They just couldn't prove it.

38:29.192 --> 38:30.342
So now they're doing life.

38:30.393 --> 38:31.843
Yeah, well, they should have
gotten the chair!

38:31.895 --> 38:33.678
Come on, Trevor, wake up.

38:33.730 --> 38:35.647
Preston set that up.

38:35.698 --> 38:39.401
Crime waves hit,
property value drops.

38:39.485 --> 38:42.520
Then Preston moves in
and buys it all up for cheap.

38:42.572 --> 38:43.855
Shut up!

38:43.907 --> 38:45.490
Trevor, listen to me.

38:45.542 --> 38:48.243
He doesn't give a damn
about black or white.

38:48.311 --> 38:51.196
The only color that son of a bitch
cares about is green.

38:51.247 --> 38:54.082
Come on, kid,
you gotta believe me.

38:54.167 --> 38:56.368
Drop the gun.

38:56.419 --> 38:59.037
You let her go,
we can work it out.

38:59.088 --> 39:02.090
He told me you would
try to turn me.

39:04.294 --> 39:05.561
There are no traitors!

39:05.645 --> 39:08.230
[Screaming]

39:08.314 --> 39:10.682
[Hilary crying]

39:17.207 --> 39:18.874
Voicemail messages?

39:18.942 --> 39:21.226
That's ludicrous.
That boy is mentally unstable.

39:21.277 --> 39:22.578
He always has been.

39:22.662 --> 39:23.979
Clark Preston, you have the right
to remain silent.

39:24.047 --> 39:25.163
I'm innocent.

39:25.231 --> 39:27.833
And please feel free
to exercise that right.

39:27.900 --> 39:29.501
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

39:29.568 --> 39:31.086
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford one,

39:31.170 --> 39:33.121
an attorney will be
appointed for you.

39:34.374 --> 39:37.292
Prentiss: "I'm for truth,
no matter who tells it.

39:37.377 --> 39:41.830
I'm for justice, no matter
who it's for or against."

39:41.898 --> 39:44.299
Malcolm X.

39:59.765 --> 40:01.183
How you doing?

40:01.251 --> 40:03.518
I'm all right.

40:03.586 --> 40:06.371
Emily...

40:06.439 --> 40:08.807
I'm so sorry.

40:11.610 --> 40:13.712
"Out there
in the field,

40:13.779 --> 40:16.581
sorry doesn't
bring people back."

40:18.234 --> 40:21.003
Ohh. Come on,
I'm messing with you.

40:21.087 --> 40:22.721
It's nothing, really.

40:25.291 --> 40:27.292
I'm ok.

40:27.343 --> 40:28.677
This isn't your fault.

40:28.761 --> 40:30.595
Actually, it is.

40:30.647 --> 40:32.898
You're a team leader.

40:32.965 --> 40:34.933
You made
a tactical decision.

40:34.984 --> 40:36.268
And you got hurt.

40:36.319 --> 40:37.853
Again.

40:40.356 --> 40:43.008
You did what you thought
was right.

40:43.076 --> 40:45.110
And that's
all you can do.

40:45.161 --> 40:49.781
The rest of it,
that's not up to us.

40:49.849 --> 40:52.250
That's the job.

40:53.236 --> 40:56.288
This is nothing, really.

41:04.764 --> 41:08.166
I mean, the thing
with Doyle, that...

41:08.217 --> 41:10.519
I'm kidding!

41:10.603 --> 41:13.505
[Laughing]

41:13.573 --> 41:15.524
I'm...

41:15.608 --> 41:17.159
