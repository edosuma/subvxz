WEBVTT

00:00.125 --> 00:02.794
Previously on Elementary...
(groans)

00:02.794 --> 00:05.130
I did it.
Mr. Meers,
to be clear;

00:05.130 --> 00:07.382
you’re confessing
to killing Tim Bledsoe.

00:07.382 --> 00:09.635
Tim Bledsoe was going to
blow up the Bridgeport ferry

00:09.635 --> 00:11.428
the day after you shot him.

00:11.428 --> 00:13.805
I’m sorry, I-I don’t know
what you’re talking about.

00:13.805 --> 00:15.557
HOLMES: Patrick Meers
was not acting alone.

00:15.557 --> 00:18.727
Someone, or some group,
were pulling his strings.

00:18.727 --> 00:20.771
Please. My family’s inside.

00:20.771 --> 00:22.272
You’re protecting someone.

00:22.272 --> 00:23.982
I wish I could help you, Joan.

00:23.982 --> 00:26.193
That video game.

00:26.193 --> 00:27.861
Is that how you
talk to them?

00:27.861 --> 00:29.529
I need you
to be brave now.

00:29.529 --> 00:31.490
Can you be brave?

00:41.041 --> 00:44.962
Ten years ago, my company wasn’t
quite where it is today.

00:44.962 --> 00:46.922
We weren’t the destination
for e-mail,

00:46.922 --> 00:50.300
search and social media for
500 million people worldwide.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.219
We were just a tiny start-up.

00:52.219 --> 00:54.721
In a sweaty office in San Jose.

00:56.390 --> 00:59.768
(sighs heavily)
2433 Piedmont Street, Suite 3.

00:59.768 --> 01:01.520
I can still smell it.

01:01.520 --> 01:05.774
And then, one day,
Suite 2 becomes available.

01:05.774 --> 01:08.193
It’s bigger, it’s nicer,
has more windows.

01:08.193 --> 01:10.946
So, we decide to make the move.

01:10.946 --> 01:13.156
Trouble is,
that means a new address.

01:13.156 --> 01:15.909
New letterhead, new envelopes,
business cards.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.870
We have to reach out
to the post office,

01:18.870 --> 01:21.540
to our clients, our suppliers.

01:21.540 --> 01:26.336
Late one night, the janitor
hears us talking about this

01:26.336 --> 01:28.964
and he says, "Why don’t
you just switch the numbers

01:28.964 --> 01:31.091
on the doors?"
(audience laughs)

01:31.091 --> 01:32.301
(applauds)

01:32.301 --> 01:35.178
And that, folks,
is the principle

01:35.178 --> 01:37.222
on which Odker was built.

01:37.222 --> 01:41.727
Simple solutions
for complicated problems.

01:41.727 --> 01:44.146
That’s how a website that
launched in an office park

01:44.146 --> 01:46.398
became a multinational empire.

01:46.398 --> 01:47.941
Leonardo da Vinci said it best.

01:47.941 --> 01:52.821
"Simplicity is the ultimate
sophistication."

01:52.821 --> 01:54.740
SHERLOCK:
Tommyrot.

01:54.740 --> 01:56.575
What are you wearing?

01:56.575 --> 01:58.327
That man
is a legitimate genius.

01:58.327 --> 02:00.162
He’s diminishing his
intellectual sophistication

02:00.162 --> 02:02.039
for the sake of
a cocktail party anecdote.

02:02.039 --> 02:03.790
It’s just naked pandering.

02:03.790 --> 02:06.877
It’s a Tech Symposium,

02:06.877 --> 02:08.920
not a doctoral defense,
and he’s one of the most

02:08.920 --> 02:11.089
successful people on the planet,
so obviously,

02:11.089 --> 02:13.342
he’s doing
something right.
Why are you interested in him?

02:13.342 --> 02:16.428
Because, apparently,
he is interested in me.

02:16.428 --> 02:17.971
Do you remember
that gun buyback program

02:17.971 --> 02:19.431
you started in my name
before I left New York?

02:19.431 --> 02:20.891
Of course, why?

02:20.891 --> 02:22.809
He just made a huge donation.

02:24.853 --> 02:26.646
How huge?
Let’s just say that

02:26.646 --> 02:28.648
the program should be
in his name now.

02:28.648 --> 02:30.525
The money came
with an invitation.

02:30.525 --> 02:32.569
He wants to meet tomorrow,

02:32.569 --> 02:33.653
so I thought
I’d get a handle on him.
(bell dings)

02:33.653 --> 02:35.655
Oh, my napalm is done curing.

02:35.655 --> 02:37.115
Good luck with
your new suitor.

02:37.115 --> 02:38.575
It’s not every day
one attracts the fancy

02:38.575 --> 02:40.452
of the eighth richest man
in America.

02:40.452 --> 02:43.580
Uh, try not to burn
the house down.

02:45.457 --> 02:46.708
(cheering, clapping)

02:51.505 --> 02:52.923
WOMAN:
Hello, Mr. 246.

02:52.923 --> 02:55.675
Is there a Mrs. 246?
Hmm, pass.

02:55.675 --> 02:57.844
I couldn’t date a guy who
has nicer legs than I do.

02:57.844 --> 02:59.679
Oh, my God.
(laughs)

02:59.679 --> 03:01.556
WOMAN:
Where’s Isabel?

03:01.556 --> 03:03.225
I thought we would
have seen her by now.

03:03.225 --> 03:05.185
I know she was trying to
finish in under two hours.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.436
Oh.
I guess it’s
tougher out there

03:06.436 --> 03:07.187
than she would
have thought.
Hmm.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.980
(gasps)

03:08.980 --> 03:11.400
WOMAN 2: There she is!
WOMAN: Oh... (whoops)

03:11.400 --> 03:12.567
You got this!

03:12.567 --> 03:13.902
God, she looks awful.

03:13.902 --> 03:15.612
We would, too, after ten
miles of trail running

03:15.612 --> 03:16.530
and obstacle courses.

03:16.530 --> 03:19.199
WOMAN:
Come on, girl!

03:19.199 --> 03:21.118
You’re so close!
Go, go,
go, go, go!

03:21.118 --> 03:23.036
What-what’s happening?
Why is she stopping?

03:23.036 --> 03:26.206
WOMAN 2: I don’t know.
(grunts)

03:26.206 --> 03:27.374
(screams)

03:27.374 --> 03:29.000
Oh, my God.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.794
(indistinct chatter)

03:30.794 --> 03:33.171
Is she still breathing?
I don’t know.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.748
Her name is Isabel Perez,
she’s 27.

04:08.748 --> 04:11.501
(sighs) Was 27.

04:11.501 --> 04:13.962
We were roommates.

04:13.962 --> 04:16.381
Can you think of anyone who
would have wanted to hurt her?

04:16.381 --> 04:19.092
Isabel worked in admissions
at this ritzy private school

04:19.092 --> 04:20.969
in Tribeca, Saint Mark’s.

04:20.969 --> 04:23.513
She always took a lot of flak
when rejection letters came out.

04:23.513 --> 04:25.932
Angry parents.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.309
She’d get these
insane voice mails.

04:27.309 --> 04:29.603
There were a few threats.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.146
She ever report them?

04:31.146 --> 04:34.149
I don’t know.
I don’t think so.

04:34.149 --> 04:37.444
I’ll check with the school;
they might have kept track.

04:37.444 --> 04:40.864
If you think of anything else,
you call this number, okay?

04:42.991 --> 04:44.576
I have to go walk
the course now.

04:44.576 --> 04:46.036
We have to find where
Isabel was attacked

04:46.036 --> 04:48.163
if we’re gonna find
the person who did this.

04:48.163 --> 04:49.623
You have any friends here,
someone to drive you home?

04:49.623 --> 04:50.916
Yeah.

04:50.916 --> 04:52.375
All right.

04:52.375 --> 04:53.710
U-Um, Detective.

04:53.710 --> 04:56.338
There is no course.

04:56.338 --> 04:58.173
Sorry?

04:58.173 --> 04:59.758
This is an adventure race.

04:59.758 --> 05:02.719
It means there’s no set route.

05:02.719 --> 05:04.971
There’s a bunch of checkpoints
all over the forest.

05:04.971 --> 05:07.057
The runners all start together,
but then they can

05:07.057 --> 05:08.266
go to the checkpoints
in whatever order they want,

05:08.266 --> 05:09.518
as long as they
get to all of them

05:09.518 --> 05:11.520
before they reach
the finish line.

05:11.520 --> 05:14.272
You’re telling me every inch of
this forest is fair game?

05:14.272 --> 05:17.192
I think I heard
it’s something like 3,000 acres.

05:17.192 --> 05:19.736
Finding out where Isabel
was attacked could take days.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.238
HOLMES: Happened in
the Southwest corner

05:21.238 --> 05:22.822
of the park near the edge
of Richmond Pond.

05:25.575 --> 05:28.078
BELL:
You gonna tell me how you know

05:28.078 --> 05:30.914
where this girl was stabbed
or am I supposed to guess?

05:30.914 --> 05:32.499
I examined Miss Perez’s body

05:32.499 --> 05:34.167
while you were talking
to her friend.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.336
There was a smear of marsh mud
on her left leg.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.088
There was mud
all over her body.

05:38.088 --> 05:41.341
Yeah, but most of that mud
had dried.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.885
The marsh mud above her
left ankle was still damp.

05:43.885 --> 05:45.804
(scoffs) Okay.

05:45.804 --> 05:47.597
There are several bodies
of water in the Greenbelt,

05:47.597 --> 05:50.600
but only one of them is
surrounded by marshland.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.269
Richmond Pond.

05:54.604 --> 05:58.316
Given that the marsh mud was
the freshest muck on her body...

05:58.316 --> 06:01.486
We can assume the
area around the pond

06:01.486 --> 06:04.072
is where the attack went down.
Yeah.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.699
She had a six-inch blade
in her back.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.576
She couldn’t have made it far
in that condition.

06:07.576 --> 06:09.619
I’m not sure how likely
it is we’ll find

06:09.619 --> 06:12.414
the exact scene of
the stabbing, but...

06:12.414 --> 06:14.249
Who knows, maybe we’ll
find a creepy shack

06:14.249 --> 06:16.084
with a door
off its hinges.

06:17.586 --> 06:19.504
Yeah. Maybe.

06:35.520 --> 06:39.399
Got metal pots, copper coiling,
propane tanks.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.443
Looks like a bootleg
distillery to me.

06:41.443 --> 06:42.986
What’s left of one, anyway.

06:45.989 --> 06:48.283
Well, it’s certainly
a crime scene, but...

06:48.283 --> 06:49.784
I don’t think it was
where Isabel was stabbed.

06:49.784 --> 06:52.454
No?
No.

06:52.454 --> 06:55.248
There’s two distinct sets
of footprints.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.250
But neither
one of them is

06:57.250 --> 06:59.002
small enough
to be hers.
(camera shutter clicks)

06:59.002 --> 07:01.212
I doubt she was ever in here.

07:01.212 --> 07:03.632
Then I wonder
whose blood that is.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.593
Someone else’s.

07:08.470 --> 07:10.930
The knife in her back
pierced only muscle.

07:10.930 --> 07:14.309
Didn’t sever any major arteries;
that’s why she was able

07:14.309 --> 07:16.603
to escape and make it
to the finish line

07:16.603 --> 07:18.104
before succumbing to her wounds.

07:18.104 --> 07:20.273
This spatter is more
consistent with...

07:20.273 --> 07:22.108
a shooting.

07:22.108 --> 07:24.527
Judging by the amount of blood,
I’d say a fatal one.

07:24.527 --> 07:28.573
So, someone gets shot here
making moonshine or whatever,

07:28.573 --> 07:30.325
Isabel runs by
during the race...

07:30.325 --> 07:32.118
Becomes a witness

07:32.118 --> 07:33.536
that the killer feels compelled
to deal with.

07:33.536 --> 07:35.330
BELL: But he
doesn’t shoot her.

07:35.330 --> 07:38.124
He stabs her.
That make sense to you?

07:38.124 --> 07:40.335
I think we have to identify
the first victim

07:40.335 --> 07:41.961
before we’ve got a chance
at solving anything.

07:41.961 --> 07:45.048
Well, we have to find them
before we can identify them.

07:46.966 --> 07:48.635
(camera shutter clicks)

07:48.635 --> 07:52.347
Dredge the pond and you will.

07:52.347 --> 07:53.932
These marks were made
when the shooting victim

07:53.932 --> 07:55.141
was dragged out of here.

07:55.141 --> 07:57.435
The heels of his
shoes made them

07:57.435 --> 07:58.645
before he was
dumped in the water.

08:02.232 --> 08:04.192
Looks like he
was weighed down

08:04.192 --> 08:05.193
with some big rocks.

08:05.193 --> 08:06.861
I can see where
they used to be.

08:06.861 --> 08:09.406
I’ll get the
scuba team out here.

08:09.406 --> 08:12.409
NARRATOR:
From search to social media

08:12.409 --> 08:14.619
to scientific research,

08:14.619 --> 08:17.455
Odker is more
than just a company.

08:17.455 --> 08:20.333
Odker is your solution.
Ms. Watson?

08:20.333 --> 08:22.043
You should get going.

08:22.043 --> 08:24.045
No, I don’t understand.
I had an appointment.

08:24.045 --> 08:25.296
Mm-hmm?
Am I at the
wrong office?

08:25.296 --> 08:26.881
Is this the online
search office

08:26.881 --> 08:28.675
and I’m supposed to be at
the social media headquarters?

08:28.675 --> 08:30.260
Oh, no, there’s no confusion.

08:30.260 --> 08:32.804
Odin’s expecting you offsite.
Clark will drive you.

08:32.804 --> 08:34.723
Drive me where?

08:45.525 --> 08:48.278
Ah, Ms. Watson.

08:48.278 --> 08:49.612
Thank you so much
for coming out.

08:49.612 --> 08:51.448
It’s my pleasure.

08:51.448 --> 08:53.783
Sorry about the field trip.

08:53.783 --> 08:57.120
It’s just the only time I
get any bandwidth these days

08:57.120 --> 08:59.164
is during my archery
and I didn’t want to miss

08:59.164 --> 09:00.957
the opportunity to meet.

09:00.957 --> 09:02.625
WATSON:
Bow and arrow.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.753
That’s pretty lo-fi
for a high tech guy.

09:04.753 --> 09:06.546
Exactly. It’s primal.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.006
It settles the mind.

09:08.006 --> 09:10.300
Some place for it.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.804
I made a donation to
the Parks Department last year

09:14.804 --> 09:16.973
and this is their way
of saying thank you, I guess.

09:16.973 --> 09:19.184
They gave you a park?

09:19.184 --> 09:21.561
Oh, for-for one hour a day.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.188
I really am grateful.

09:23.188 --> 09:24.773
I mean, the money
that you put into

09:24.773 --> 09:26.399
the buyback program
is gonna go a long way.

09:26.399 --> 09:29.486
I’ll confess,
I’m a little skeptical

09:29.486 --> 09:31.237
about the gun buyback
initiative.

09:31.237 --> 09:33.448
Not the goal, of course.
Just the efficacy of it.

09:33.448 --> 09:35.241
Jury’s out, I’d say.

09:35.241 --> 09:38.411
So, the donation you made was
just to find out if they work?

09:38.411 --> 09:41.414
No, it was to buy
an introduction.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.875
And maybe earn
a small favor.

09:46.002 --> 09:50.006
I, uh, I have a problem.

09:50.006 --> 09:52.550
It’s well below your
pay grade, I’m sure,

09:52.550 --> 09:56.137
but I’m told that you and
your partner are the best.

09:56.137 --> 09:58.473
I’d be in your debt if you
could make time to help.

10:00.266 --> 10:04.187
Last week, my sister
received a couple of letters.

10:04.187 --> 10:06.773
Someone threatened
to kidnap her daughter

10:06.773 --> 10:09.192
if we didn’t pay up.

10:09.192 --> 10:11.820
At first, I thought this was
some kind of cruel prank.

10:11.820 --> 10:14.113
I mean, normally you have
to actually kidnap someone

10:14.113 --> 10:15.657
before you demand a ransom,

10:15.657 --> 10:17.992
but then these showed up.

10:21.871 --> 10:23.289
Is this your niece?

10:23.289 --> 10:24.999
Abigail. She’s 16.

10:24.999 --> 10:27.752
Whoever sent this knows
where she hangs out,

10:27.752 --> 10:29.671
who her friends are.

10:29.671 --> 10:32.423
I want you and your partner
to find out who sent this.

10:32.423 --> 10:35.301
I have to ask: Why us?

10:35.301 --> 10:36.469
I’m sure you have
people on your staff

10:36.469 --> 10:38.179
who can handle this.

10:38.179 --> 10:40.223
Yes, I do have good
people on the payroll,

10:40.223 --> 10:41.683
but that’s the problem--

10:41.683 --> 10:43.226
You see, I think these
threats came from someone

10:43.226 --> 10:44.853
who works for me.

10:44.853 --> 10:46.896
What makes you think that?

10:46.896 --> 10:48.940
One of the letters
referenced

10:48.940 --> 10:50.650
Abigail going to
an equestrian camp.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.277
Thing is, she’s
never been to one.

10:52.277 --> 10:54.612
I was thinking of surprising
her for her birthday,

10:54.612 --> 10:57.240
and I mentioned it at a company
dinner a couple of weeks ago.

10:57.240 --> 10:58.908
The only people
that knew

10:58.908 --> 11:01.494
I was thinking of
sending her to that camp

11:01.494 --> 11:04.205
are the Odker employees
who were there that night.

11:04.205 --> 11:06.249
And my head of security
is one of them.

11:06.249 --> 11:09.002
So you need an outsider.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.795
My niece is in
real danger.

11:10.795 --> 11:12.839
Her mother’s a wreck.
I won’t rest easy

11:12.839 --> 11:13.965
until this is settled.

11:13.965 --> 11:15.967
Can you help me?

11:18.970 --> 11:20.430
(footsteps approaching)

11:20.430 --> 11:23.016
How did it go with your
billionaire admirer?

11:23.016 --> 11:24.559
Our billionaire admirer.

11:24.559 --> 11:26.227
It turns out

11:26.227 --> 11:28.271
he knows all about us,
and he wants to use us

11:28.271 --> 11:29.522
to look into kidnapping threats

11:29.522 --> 11:30.982
against his niece.

11:30.982 --> 11:32.775
So these are the
letters that he got.

11:32.775 --> 11:34.777
What did you say?
I said yes.

11:34.777 --> 11:36.446
I mean, after the check

11:36.446 --> 11:38.281
he gave our foundation,
this is sort of

11:38.281 --> 11:40.199
the least we could do, no?
I loathe that expression.

11:40.199 --> 11:42.577
The least one could do
is always nothing.

11:42.577 --> 11:44.454
Abigail’s family tree

11:44.454 --> 11:46.915
makes her an easy target
for lowlifes and miscreants.

11:46.915 --> 11:49.292
Any threat against her is more
likely a haphazard shakedown

11:49.292 --> 11:50.835
than a legitimate risk.

11:50.835 --> 11:52.795
It hardly seems worthy
of our time.

11:52.795 --> 11:54.297
You seriously
don’t want to help?

11:54.297 --> 11:56.424
I’d like to know
why you do.

11:56.424 --> 11:59.135
And before you say the donation,
it was certainly generous, yes,

11:59.135 --> 12:00.470
but the whole reason
it’s called charity

12:00.470 --> 12:02.889
is because it requires
no recompense.

12:02.889 --> 12:05.141
Well, I think a relationship
with Odin could be a good thing.

12:05.141 --> 12:07.101
And before you say it,
I am not talking about sex.

12:07.101 --> 12:08.853
I was gonna say it.

12:08.853 --> 12:10.605
I’m thinking about our work.

12:10.605 --> 12:13.274
I mean, the guy is sitting
on the most extensive trove

12:13.274 --> 12:15.360
of private user data
in the world.

12:15.360 --> 12:17.403
I mean, you don’t
think that would be

12:17.403 --> 12:19.155
a nice resource for a
couple of detectives?

12:19.155 --> 12:21.324
(sighs)
How do you suggest we proceed?

12:21.324 --> 12:23.493
He’s gonna let us
into his offices late tonight.

12:23.493 --> 12:26.412
He thinks the threats are coming
from someone inside Odker.

12:26.412 --> 12:27.747
With a little luck

12:27.747 --> 12:29.123
and access
to everyone’s computers,

12:29.123 --> 12:30.708
we should be able
to find out who.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.627
(phone rings)

12:35.380 --> 12:37.382
Were the divers successful?

12:37.382 --> 12:39.592
BELL: Twice as successful
as we thought they’d be.

12:39.592 --> 12:40.927
They found two bodies.

12:40.927 --> 12:43.554
Want to meet me at the morgue?

12:43.554 --> 12:46.808
HAWES: Meet John Doe.
Late 40s. Gunshot victim.

12:46.808 --> 12:48.309
Water damage makes it hard
to nail down

12:48.309 --> 12:49.852
exactly when it happened,
but I’m guessing

12:49.852 --> 12:51.145
sometime early this morning.

12:51.145 --> 12:52.814
Well, there’s
not much tissue damage

12:52.814 --> 12:54.399
around the entry wound.

12:54.399 --> 12:55.733
Must have been

12:55.733 --> 12:57.151
from a small caliber round.

12:57.151 --> 12:58.569
Fired from something weak.

12:58.569 --> 13:03.282
How about a single-shot
Remington derringer?

13:03.282 --> 13:05.076
Scuba team found it in the
pond next to the bodies.

13:05.076 --> 13:07.453
Only holds one shot.

13:07.453 --> 13:10.289
One shot. All guns should be
Remington derringers.

13:10.289 --> 13:12.834
A relic from the 19th century;
won’t be easy to trace.

13:12.834 --> 13:14.669
HAWES: I’m hoping we have
better luck with him.

13:14.669 --> 13:16.379
They’re running his fingerprints
and dental records--

13:16.379 --> 13:17.839
if they’re in the system, we’ll
have his name in a few hours.

13:17.839 --> 13:19.632
Any luck IDing
the second victim?

13:19.632 --> 13:21.342
BELL:
Actually, yeah.

13:21.342 --> 13:23.177
According to his collar,
his name is Truffles.

13:25.722 --> 13:26.931
WATSON:
I’m confused. Are you saying

13:26.931 --> 13:28.683
the person that killed this man

13:28.683 --> 13:30.601
also killed this pig?

13:30.601 --> 13:32.478
Hog, actually.

13:32.478 --> 13:34.939
And I had doubts myself
until I saw photos

13:34.939 --> 13:37.942
of the recovery operation.

13:37.942 --> 13:39.652
Both bodies were weighed down
the same way.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.279
Same rope. Same knots.

13:41.279 --> 13:43.114
Same heavy rocks from
the edge of the pond.

13:43.114 --> 13:45.700
Any bullet holes in it?
Nope.

13:45.700 --> 13:47.702
So his demise wasn’t
caused by the derringer.

13:47.702 --> 13:49.370
How did it die?

13:49.370 --> 13:51.706
Working on it.
Uh, we’re a little outside

13:51.706 --> 13:52.915
my area of expertise.

13:52.915 --> 13:53.916
WATSON:
Mine, too.

13:53.916 --> 13:55.543
But you and I have dissected

13:55.543 --> 13:56.711
enough animal cadavers

13:56.711 --> 13:57.962
in medical school.

13:57.962 --> 13:59.881
Dilated pupils like this
in a mammal could mean

13:59.881 --> 14:01.340
that it was fed
something toxic.

14:01.340 --> 14:02.508
HAWES: Already sent
a blood sample

14:02.508 --> 14:03.760
to the lab.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.094
Say you’re right.

14:05.094 --> 14:06.554
Why would someone want
to poison a hog?

14:06.554 --> 14:08.473
And why hide its body?

14:08.473 --> 14:09.807
HOLMES:
So, a man in a forest,

14:09.807 --> 14:11.642
and his hog,

14:11.642 --> 14:13.186
both killed
at the same time.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.188
Unless we’re looking
at the fallout

14:15.188 --> 14:17.190
from the world’s most
nauseating love triangle,

14:17.190 --> 14:18.357
we have three victims,

14:18.357 --> 14:19.692
two murder weapons...

14:19.692 --> 14:20.651
BELL:
And zero motive.

14:29.786 --> 14:32.246
WATSON:
We got an ID on the man
they pulled from the pond.

14:32.246 --> 14:34.499
His name was Reginald Henderson.

14:34.499 --> 14:37.001
He went by "Renny."
He was a bartender in Brooklyn.

14:37.001 --> 14:40.004
We’re pretty sure that he owned
the illegal distillery

14:40.004 --> 14:41.464
that Marcus
and Sherlock found.

14:41.464 --> 14:43.466
He had an old arrest
for selling moonshine.

14:43.466 --> 14:44.967
That’s why his prints
were in the system.

14:47.345 --> 14:48.846
This his pig?

14:48.846 --> 14:49.889
Hog.

14:51.265 --> 14:53.518
But yes.
They found this photo

14:53.518 --> 14:55.144
in the shack.

14:55.144 --> 14:57.396
DWYER:
Killing the guy’s pet...

14:57.396 --> 14:59.398
Man, that just seems...

14:59.398 --> 15:01.651
mean-spirited.
Sherlock and I
don’t think

15:01.651 --> 15:03.152
it was done out of spite.

15:03.152 --> 15:04.946
We think it was part
of a larger plot.

15:04.946 --> 15:06.697
CSU found trace amounts of ricin

15:06.697 --> 15:08.658
in some of the broken equipment

15:08.658 --> 15:09.700
in the shack.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.160
The lab confirmed
that it was

15:11.160 --> 15:12.787
the same toxin
that killed Truffles.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.456
The hog.

15:15.456 --> 15:17.959
If this adds up
to a larger plot,

15:17.959 --> 15:20.086
I’m not seeing it.

15:20.086 --> 15:22.588
We got a runner with
a knife in her back,

15:22.588 --> 15:25.091
a dead bootlegger
and a poisoned animal.

15:25.091 --> 15:26.259
What am I missing?

15:26.259 --> 15:27.552
I think the key

15:27.552 --> 15:28.761
is the order
in which they died.

15:28.761 --> 15:29.762
So first it was Truffles,

15:29.762 --> 15:30.763
then the bootlegger,

15:30.763 --> 15:31.764
and then the runner.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.224
It all started when Renny

15:33.224 --> 15:34.392
started making ricin
in his distillery.

15:34.392 --> 15:35.935
You think
he’s the one

15:35.935 --> 15:38.729
who made the stuff
that killed his pet?

15:38.729 --> 15:40.773
He had the expertise

15:40.773 --> 15:41.983
and the equipment.

15:41.983 --> 15:43.818
And it’s easy to extract toxins

15:43.818 --> 15:46.195
from castor beans if you’re
used to making alcohol.

15:46.195 --> 15:47.697
Now, the question is,

15:47.697 --> 15:49.365
was he forced to make it, or...

15:49.365 --> 15:51.576
was he working with the killer
before he died?

15:51.576 --> 15:53.286
Either way, the killer tests
the stuff out on Truffles.

15:53.286 --> 15:54.704
Probably at gunpoint.

15:54.704 --> 15:58.457
When he sees it works,
he shoots Renny.

15:58.457 --> 16:01.002
And that’s when Isabel Perez
jogs by, catches him in the act.

16:01.002 --> 16:02.378
He only had one round

16:02.378 --> 16:04.797
in his gun,
and he had already fired it.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.133
So he attacks her with a knife.

16:10.052 --> 16:12.221
Why the weird old gun?
Probably because

16:12.221 --> 16:14.307
he had a record
and couldn’t buy a gun legally,

16:14.307 --> 16:16.893
so he used a family heirloom.
We looking at
Renny’s friends

16:16.893 --> 16:18.644
and associates?
Turns out
he had a fight

16:18.644 --> 16:21.439
with his boss at the bar
he worked at a month ago.

16:21.439 --> 16:24.150
Marcus is already
on his way there.

16:24.150 --> 16:25.818
(loud music playing,
indistinct chatter)

16:30.615 --> 16:32.617
Excuse me.

16:35.244 --> 16:36.412
Yo, bartender.

16:36.412 --> 16:38.080
In a minute.

16:39.457 --> 16:40.958
(whistles)

16:45.671 --> 16:47.673
I need to talk to your boss,
Bo Willoughby.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.091
Can you get him for me?

16:49.091 --> 16:50.551
Sorry, Bo’s not here.

16:50.551 --> 16:52.261
He called in earlier,
said he was taking a trip.

16:52.261 --> 16:54.055
Kind of a last-minute thing.

16:54.055 --> 16:55.723
(sighs)
Three weeks ago,

16:55.723 --> 16:57.683
Bo got into a fight with another
one of the bartenders here,

16:57.683 --> 16:59.518
Renny Henderson.

16:59.518 --> 17:01.229
You know what
it was about?
Yeah.

17:01.229 --> 17:02.605
They’d both been drinking.

17:02.605 --> 17:04.649
They got a little annoyed
with each other.

17:04.649 --> 17:06.984
It was nothing.
I’m not so sure
about that.

17:06.984 --> 17:08.861
Renny’s the reason I’m here.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.821
He was murdered this morning.

17:10.821 --> 17:13.324
What?
That’s why I need
to know more

17:13.324 --> 17:15.201
about the fight
he had with Bo.

17:18.955 --> 17:20.373
You want me
to shut this place down?

17:20.373 --> 17:22.166
Wouldn’t be a problem.

17:22.166 --> 17:23.793
I didn’t really know Renny.

17:23.793 --> 17:25.586
We weren’t friends
or anything.

17:25.586 --> 17:27.546
But I know he had a side
business making moonshine.

17:27.546 --> 17:30.258
It was good stuff.
Bo would let him sell it here,

17:30.258 --> 17:31.676
and they would share
the profits.

17:31.676 --> 17:33.970
Artisanal moonshine?

17:33.970 --> 17:36.806
That day that they fought,
Renny was ticked.

17:36.806 --> 17:38.599
He said Bo was taking
too big a cut.

17:38.599 --> 17:40.226
They started swinging,
the next thing you know,

17:40.226 --> 17:41.602
the customers
are calling the cops.

17:41.602 --> 17:43.396
They stay mad,
or was it settled?

17:43.396 --> 17:44.855
Bo fired Renny.

17:44.855 --> 17:47.149
Renny said Bo had
better watch his back.

17:47.149 --> 17:49.986
That was the last time
I saw Renny.

17:49.986 --> 17:51.195
You need anything else?

17:51.195 --> 17:52.989
Yeah. Bo’s number.

17:55.199 --> 17:57.493
I just heard from Marcus.

17:57.493 --> 17:59.829
Looks like Renny’s boss
could be our guy.

17:59.829 --> 18:01.455
His name is Bo Willoughby.

18:01.455 --> 18:03.124
He’s putting out
a Finest Message.

18:04.625 --> 18:06.294
What is that?

18:06.294 --> 18:08.129
I mean, I can see
it’s a wine bottle.

18:08.129 --> 18:10.256
Yeah, the, uh, floor
of Renny’s shack

18:10.256 --> 18:11.924
was covered in glass.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.926
I was studying a
crime scene photograph,

18:13.926 --> 18:16.971
and I noticed that some shards
in the corner really stood out.

18:16.971 --> 18:19.140
I sifted those chunks
out of the rest of the pile

18:19.140 --> 18:21.600
that CSU collected,
and I could see why.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.103
They’re older.
Decades older, in fact.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.980
So it’s an antique wine bottle?

18:25.980 --> 18:27.732
Mm-hmm. Well,
most of one.

18:27.732 --> 18:29.900
The section where the
label would be is missing,

18:29.900 --> 18:31.569
hence the modeling clay.

18:31.569 --> 18:33.362
So the killer took
the label. Why?

18:33.362 --> 18:36.449
Well, I’m hoping
that’s a question...

18:36.449 --> 18:39.327
we’ll be able
to ask him ourselves.

18:39.327 --> 18:41.412
You found a print?
Yeah.

18:41.412 --> 18:44.415
I can already tell
from the swirl pattern

18:44.415 --> 18:45.916
that it’s not Renny Henderson’s.

18:45.916 --> 18:48.252
You said Marcus believes
Bo Willoughby is a suspect.

18:48.252 --> 18:49.920
Well, he would have
given his fingerprints

18:49.920 --> 18:51.589
when he applied
for a liquor license.

18:51.589 --> 18:53.924
So I’ll tell Marcus
he needs to procure

18:53.924 --> 18:56.385
Bo’s application for comparison.

18:56.385 --> 18:59.722
In the meantime,
you and I are due at Odker.

18:59.722 --> 19:00.681
(elevator bell dings)

19:03.225 --> 19:05.019
Joan, thanks so much for coming.

19:05.019 --> 19:06.812
You must be Sherlock.
Yes.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.272
I understand we’re here
to find a quisling

19:08.272 --> 19:09.690
in your organization.
Probably one

19:09.690 --> 19:11.317
of my guys
in the coding lab.

19:11.317 --> 19:13.152
I was toasting them
when I made the comments

19:13.152 --> 19:14.654
that showed up
in those threat letters.

19:14.654 --> 19:17.156
If not, you can check
my head of security.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.492
He’s up in the C-suite. Sims.

19:19.492 --> 19:20.743
Name’s on the door.
Probably best

19:20.743 --> 19:21.869
to be gone by 4:00.

19:21.869 --> 19:23.329
We have early
risers here.

19:23.329 --> 19:24.622
You’re not staying?

19:24.622 --> 19:26.874
Oh. No.
(chuckles)

19:26.874 --> 19:29.627
My autobiography says
that the secret of my success

19:29.627 --> 19:32.046
is "a dedicated spirit"--
truth is,

19:32.046 --> 19:34.298
that just tested well
in focus groups.

19:34.298 --> 19:36.008
My real secret is
eight hours’ sleep,

19:36.008 --> 19:38.135
every night, no excuses.

19:39.261 --> 19:41.680
You do what you have to here.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.015
Whatever it takes

19:43.015 --> 19:44.433
to keep Abigail safe.

19:44.433 --> 19:45.684
All right, we’ll call you

19:45.684 --> 19:46.936
in the morning with an update.

19:47.812 --> 19:49.688
Not too early.

19:49.688 --> 19:51.065
(chuckles)

19:51.065 --> 19:52.566
(lock beeps)

19:53.943 --> 19:55.361
Good luck.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.953
WATSON:
So, Matthew Yang

20:03.953 --> 20:06.956
is using pirated software
to cheat at online chess,

20:06.956 --> 20:09.917
and he illegally downloaded
the last Sharknado movie.

20:09.917 --> 20:12.795
Other than that,
he’s clean.

20:12.795 --> 20:15.089
I’m ready to call it.
We’ve looked at everyone.

20:15.089 --> 20:16.715
I think we go to Odin,

20:16.715 --> 20:18.717
and we tell him that we need
to look at the waitstaff

20:18.717 --> 20:19.718
at the restaurant where he
talked about his niece,

20:19.718 --> 20:22.096
because I don’t think
anyone here

20:22.096 --> 20:24.056
where he works is
behind the threats.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.267
You might be incorrect.

20:32.773 --> 20:34.358
When did you find all this?

20:34.358 --> 20:36.152
While you were watching
Sharknado.

20:36.152 --> 20:39.113
These are poker chips
from an illicit cardroom

20:39.113 --> 20:41.323
or casino, judging
by the poor quality.

20:41.323 --> 20:42.533
The occupant of this desk,

20:42.533 --> 20:44.910
Blake Tofel,
is swimming in debt.

20:47.705 --> 20:50.040
Oh.

20:50.040 --> 20:51.709
He’s also written
a lot of big checks,

20:51.709 --> 20:53.127
and none of them
have his name on it.

20:53.127 --> 20:55.379
Now, what is Cashew LTD?

20:55.379 --> 20:57.590
It appears to be an "S" corp

20:57.590 --> 21:00.801
that Mr. Tofel uses to hide his
illicit gambling from the IRS.

21:00.801 --> 21:03.596
Oh, there is a recent debit here
for 75 grand.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.264
I mean,
I know Odker pays well, but...

21:05.264 --> 21:08.851
Exactly. This book appears
to tell the story

21:08.851 --> 21:10.728
of a man
with a gambling addiction.

21:10.728 --> 21:12.062
I don’t imagine
there’s anything in there

21:12.062 --> 21:13.856
about him threatening
his boss’s niece

21:13.856 --> 21:15.191
and demanding a ransom.

21:15.191 --> 21:16.692
No, but we both know

21:16.692 --> 21:19.028
that addiction
can be like an organism.

21:19.028 --> 21:20.237
It can fight
to stay alive.

21:20.237 --> 21:21.906
Easy to imagine
that if he ran out of money,

21:21.906 --> 21:24.116
he might go to great lengths
to get some more.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.660
I’m not ready to go to
Mr. Tofel’s employer yet,

21:26.660 --> 21:27.786
but I think he’s worth
a closer look.

21:37.213 --> 21:38.714
Marcus!

21:38.714 --> 21:40.591
BELL: Hey.
Sorry to bother you so early.

21:40.591 --> 21:43.344
Nonsense. Watson and I are
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

21:43.344 --> 21:46.096
We ran the fingerprint you found
on that antique wine bottle

21:46.096 --> 21:48.516
and got a match, but it’s not
the one we were expecting.

21:48.516 --> 21:49.892
In fact, I think
the whole investigation

21:49.892 --> 21:51.894
is moving in a new direction.

21:51.894 --> 21:52.978
It wasn’t Bo Willoughby’s?

21:52.978 --> 21:54.104
BELL:
No. He’s innocent.

21:54.104 --> 21:55.523
We caught up with him up
at a bachelor party

21:55.523 --> 21:57.483
late last night on Long Island.

21:57.483 --> 21:59.276
He told us
he’d been there all weekend.

21:59.276 --> 22:00.528
He can prove as much?

22:00.528 --> 22:01.987
BELL:
Six different ways.

22:01.987 --> 22:03.197
He didn’t kill anyone.

22:03.197 --> 22:04.532
Not yesterday morning, anyway.

22:04.532 --> 22:06.659
But the print you found,

22:06.659 --> 22:09.787
that’s our new angle. Belongs
to a guy named Todd Harris.

22:09.787 --> 22:12.665
He’s a wine dealer. Sells
high-end stuff all over town,

22:12.665 --> 22:15.167
including
to Bo Willoughby’s bar.

22:15.167 --> 22:17.586
It stands to reason he would’ve
known Renny Henderson.

22:17.586 --> 22:19.380
HOLMES: How did Mr. Harris
run afoul of the law?

22:19.380 --> 22:21.090
Why are his prints
in the system?

22:21.090 --> 22:22.675
BELL: He was arrested for
assault when he was 18.

22:22.675 --> 22:24.635
Broke the victim’s arm
in two places.

22:24.635 --> 22:27.555
Well, sounds like someone who
would kill two people and a hog.

22:27.555 --> 22:29.431
HOLMES:
Where is he now?

22:29.431 --> 22:31.767
Hard to say. None of his clients
have seen him in two days,

22:31.767 --> 22:33.978
but he’s about to hear
from the NYPD.

22:33.978 --> 22:35.312
I’ll let you know how it goes.

22:38.399 --> 22:40.317
(indistinct radio chatter)

22:44.405 --> 22:47.032
Mr. Harris, open up.
This is the police.

22:47.032 --> 22:48.701
We’d like to talk with you.

22:54.415 --> 22:56.125
Something’s wrong.

22:57.418 --> 23:00.421
Mr. Harris. Police.

23:02.131 --> 23:03.799
Anybody home?

23:06.969 --> 23:08.637
Mr. Harris?

23:15.185 --> 23:17.438
(labored inhale)

23:17.438 --> 23:19.106
We’ve got movement down here.

23:26.905 --> 23:28.907
Police! Don’t move.

23:28.907 --> 23:31.118
Oh, man.

23:31.118 --> 23:34.913
This is Major Case to
Central. I need a bus

23:34.913 --> 23:37.541
at 589 Sumpter Avenue
in Brooklyn.

23:37.541 --> 23:39.084
I have a male, mid-40s,

23:39.084 --> 23:40.878
victim of an apparent
gunshot wound to the neck.

23:40.878 --> 23:44.256
Put a rush on it, Central.
This guy’s lost a lot of blood.

23:53.390 --> 23:55.184
Mr. Harris?

23:55.184 --> 23:57.811
I’m Detective Bell. This is
my colleague, Joan Watson.

23:57.811 --> 24:00.022
We’re with the NYPD.

24:00.022 --> 24:03.108
Your doctor told us
that you were shot in the mouth.

24:03.108 --> 24:05.444
The bullet broke your mandible
and exited through your neck.

24:05.444 --> 24:06.904
You’re lucky to be alive.

24:06.904 --> 24:09.531
We know your jaw’s
been wired shut,

24:09.531 --> 24:13.077
but we brought this to help you
answer some questions.

24:13.077 --> 24:15.329
You can just type,

24:15.329 --> 24:17.915
and the program
will do the talking for you.

24:17.915 --> 24:19.166
AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE:
You saved my life.

24:19.166 --> 24:22.086
Thank you.

24:22.086 --> 24:24.421
I’m just glad we
found you when we did.

24:24.421 --> 24:26.590
You lost a lot of blood.

24:26.590 --> 24:28.258
And look,

24:28.258 --> 24:30.594
if you’re not up to this,
we can come back later.

24:30.594 --> 24:34.139
No. I want to help.

24:34.139 --> 24:36.725
Tell us what happened.

24:36.725 --> 24:39.520
I was in bed. Tuesday.

24:39.520 --> 24:42.690
There was a sound.
Someone in the house.

24:42.690 --> 24:44.483
Before I even got up,

24:44.483 --> 24:47.528
there was a shape,
a man, over me.

24:47.528 --> 24:51.073
He hit me. I got knocked out.

24:51.073 --> 24:52.991
So you never saw his face?

24:57.371 --> 24:59.707
I woke up a few minutes later.

24:59.707 --> 25:02.042
He tied me up, blindfolded.

25:02.042 --> 25:04.336
We were in the basement.

25:04.336 --> 25:06.964
I could hear him
looking through my wine racks.

25:06.964 --> 25:10.801
He was mad.
He couldn’t find what he wanted.

25:10.801 --> 25:12.386
He talked to you?

25:12.386 --> 25:15.389
Yes, but I didn’t know
his voice.

25:15.389 --> 25:17.349
I didn’t know who he was.

25:17.349 --> 25:20.144
He wanted my Baptiste.

25:20.144 --> 25:21.812
Is that a wine?

25:23.981 --> 25:27.568
Chateau Baptiste.
It’s French merlot.

25:27.568 --> 25:31.488
He wanted my Baptiste ’57.

25:31.488 --> 25:34.032
He started yelling.
"Where is it?"

25:34.032 --> 25:36.994
I told him I had three bottles
in a locked cabinet.

25:36.994 --> 25:38.454
We saw those
cabinets down there.

25:38.454 --> 25:39.705
Is that where you
keep the good stuff?

25:43.667 --> 25:46.003
Looks like he left
everything else in there.

25:46.003 --> 25:47.921
So that was
the only wine he wanted?

25:47.921 --> 25:49.923
Yes.

25:49.923 --> 25:52.843
He took it
and put a gun in my mouth.

25:52.843 --> 25:56.263
When he shot,
I thought I was dead.

25:56.263 --> 25:59.433
I don’t know when I woke up,
but he was gone.

25:59.433 --> 26:01.685
I was still tied up.

26:01.685 --> 26:04.062
Everything hurt.

26:04.062 --> 26:07.483
It was torture.
But then you found me.

26:07.483 --> 26:09.485
I can’t thank you enough.

26:09.485 --> 26:12.529
Don’t thank us yet.
We still need to find this guy.

26:12.529 --> 26:14.740
And we will.

26:14.740 --> 26:17.326
WATSON: Got to think that
that guy was shot

26:17.326 --> 26:18.744
by the same person

26:18.744 --> 26:20.913
who killed Renny Henderson
and Isabel Perez.

26:20.913 --> 26:22.956
Ballistics already confirmed
that the bullet

26:22.956 --> 26:24.291
that came out of his neck
was fired

26:24.291 --> 26:25.709
from a Remington derringer.

26:25.709 --> 26:28.337
Thing is, if he got robbed
on Tuesday night,

26:28.337 --> 26:30.088
that means he was
the first victim.

26:30.088 --> 26:32.090
The other two got killed
the next morning.

26:32.090 --> 26:33.759
The antique bottle that
Sherlock put together,

26:33.759 --> 26:35.302
it has to be the same bottle

26:35.302 --> 26:37.179
that the killer stole, right?

26:37.179 --> 26:39.014
I mean, he wanted to lace it
with the ricin that Renny made.

26:39.014 --> 26:40.808
That’s why he took the label
with him when he fled.

26:40.808 --> 26:43.060
He didn’t want
anyone catching on.

26:43.060 --> 26:45.938
Question is, why did it have
to be Chateau Baptiste ’57?

26:45.938 --> 26:47.898
Why not one of Harris’s
other bottles?

26:47.898 --> 26:50.317
Think I should put it out
to the media, ask them to alert

26:50.317 --> 26:52.152
all the bars and restaurants
in the city.

26:52.152 --> 26:53.946
They need to hold off
on serving any of the stuff

26:53.946 --> 26:55.572
until we figure this out.

26:55.572 --> 26:57.241
No telling where
the poisoned bottles

26:57.241 --> 26:59.743
might pop up,
so better safe than sorry.

26:59.743 --> 27:01.411
I don’t think they’re gonna
pop up just anywhere.

27:01.411 --> 27:03.330
I think I know exactly
who the killer wants to poison.

27:05.457 --> 27:08.377
I’ll get a location on this guy.

27:08.377 --> 27:09.670
We can go alert him together.

27:09.670 --> 27:12.881
I’ll let Sherlock know.

27:12.881 --> 27:16.093
Watson, excellent timing.
I have news.

27:16.093 --> 27:18.679
So do I. I’m at the hospital
with Marcus right now.

27:18.679 --> 27:20.430
If you don’t mind, I’m
in the middle of burglarizing

27:20.430 --> 27:22.432
a criminal’s lair, so...
WATSON: What?

27:22.432 --> 27:24.142
Where are you?

27:24.142 --> 27:25.686
HOLMES: Banking associate
of mine who traced

27:25.686 --> 27:27.437
Tofel’s accounts
found rent payments

27:27.437 --> 27:29.356
for a walk-up in Tribeca.

27:29.356 --> 27:31.483
WATSON: And you thought it’d be
a good idea to break in there?

27:31.483 --> 27:33.944
Well, no, I thought
I would find evidence

27:33.944 --> 27:36.530
that Tofel authored the letters
threatening Odin’s niece,

27:36.530 --> 27:39.449
but instead I found a private
cardroom that he maintains.

27:39.449 --> 27:41.660
That’s where
the poker chips came from.

27:41.660 --> 27:44.246
It seems he’s less
degenerate gambler

27:44.246 --> 27:46.456
and more poker host.

27:46.456 --> 27:47.833
So there’s nothing
to connect him to the letters?

27:47.833 --> 27:49.334
HOLMES:
No. In fact, I no longer think

27:49.334 --> 27:51.086
he had anything to do with it.

27:51.086 --> 27:53.088
It seems that his side business
is doing quite well.

27:53.088 --> 27:54.840
He’s actually up on the year.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.300
That sort of blows our motive.

27:56.300 --> 27:57.885
HOLMES:
The man writes

27:57.885 --> 27:59.928
dynamic programming algorithms
for Odker.

27:59.928 --> 28:02.264
We shouldn’t be surprised
that blackjack

28:02.264 --> 28:04.600
hasn’t proven so vexing
as to bankrupt him.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.393
We’ll have to go back
to the drawing board.

28:06.393 --> 28:08.979
Well, we’ll have to break
the bad news to Odin later.

28:08.979 --> 28:11.773
Right now we have to ruin
a different rich guy’s day.

28:11.773 --> 28:14.318
You ever heard of Jason Wood?
No.

28:14.318 --> 28:15.944
Well, he’s the chief investment
officer at Grant Capital,

28:15.944 --> 28:17.446
and I believe he is the target

28:17.446 --> 28:20.574
of this ricin wine plot.

28:20.574 --> 28:22.993
It’s got to be one
of these Occupy people, right?

28:22.993 --> 28:24.745
None of them can stand the fact

28:24.745 --> 28:27.039
that someone else
has worked hard

28:27.039 --> 28:29.041
and has more than they do.
H-Hon, slow down.

28:29.041 --> 28:31.627
No one’s said a word yet about
who wants to kill me or why.

28:31.627 --> 28:33.503
To be honest, Mrs. Wood,

28:33.503 --> 28:36.048
we’re not ready to speculate
about motive at all.

28:36.048 --> 28:38.425
Then why are you so
sure Jason’s at risk?

28:38.425 --> 28:40.802
Because we already know the
murder weapon they want to use.

28:40.802 --> 28:43.263
It’s a bottle
of Chateau Baptiste ’57.

28:43.263 --> 28:44.681
That’s my favorite wine.
WATSON:
We know.

28:44.681 --> 28:46.683
In fact, anyone
who’s searched you

28:46.683 --> 28:47.768
or Chateau Baptiste
online knows.

28:47.768 --> 28:50.187
"For years,
Mr. Wood has snapped up

28:50.187 --> 28:51.813
"every bottle of Baptiste ’57

28:51.813 --> 28:54.024
"that’s come up for auction
in New York.

28:54.024 --> 28:55.192
"And while other collectors

28:55.192 --> 28:56.818
"stash their prizes
in the cellar,

28:56.818 --> 28:59.488
the banking superstar confesses
he drinks every bottle."

28:59.488 --> 29:01.531
Whoever wants you dead,

29:01.531 --> 29:04.910
we’re thinking they read this
and a light bulb went off.

29:04.910 --> 29:07.329
Someone’s out there
poisoning Baptiste?

29:07.329 --> 29:09.373
HOLMES:
With ricin.

29:09.373 --> 29:10.999
It’s cost two people
their lives so far.

29:10.999 --> 29:12.960
Another man was shot
through the neck.

29:12.960 --> 29:16.421
The killer seems hell-bent
on getting a poisoned bottle

29:16.421 --> 29:17.756
of that particular vintage
in front of you.

29:17.756 --> 29:20.467
Do you have any idea
who that might be?

29:20.467 --> 29:22.094
I mean, I help run

29:22.094 --> 29:23.762
one of the biggest hedge funds
in the world.

29:23.762 --> 29:25.472
People wanting me dead, it
kind of comes with the job.

29:25.472 --> 29:27.140
Nobody stands out?

29:27.140 --> 29:29.601
I get at least one death threat
every quarter.

29:29.601 --> 29:31.395
Two or three if we kick off

29:31.395 --> 29:33.355
a merger that leads to
labor force contractions.

29:33.355 --> 29:35.691
HOLMES: You mean, when you cost
thousands of people

29:35.691 --> 29:36.566
their jobs?

29:39.027 --> 29:41.405
You haven’t bought
any Chateau Baptiste recently,

29:41.405 --> 29:42.948
have you?
No.

29:42.948 --> 29:44.616
But I was planning on it.

29:44.616 --> 29:45.951
There’s a wine auction
in Chelsea tonight.

29:45.951 --> 29:47.786
Corinna and I were gonna
pick up a few bottles.

29:47.786 --> 29:49.413
I guess that’s out. We
can nix the babysitter.

29:49.413 --> 29:51.331
HOLMES:
On the contrary.

29:51.331 --> 29:52.833
We’d very much appreciate it
if the two of you

29:52.833 --> 29:54.084
would be our guests
this evening.

29:59.006 --> 30:01.258
I know Kevlar isn’t
a breathable fabric,

30:01.258 --> 30:03.927
but if you could stop adjusting
yourself, that’d be great.

30:03.927 --> 30:05.804
I can’t believe
I agreed to this.

30:05.804 --> 30:08.056
I can’t believe
you suggested it.

30:08.056 --> 30:10.183
Relax. Tonight’s lot

30:10.183 --> 30:12.602
was checked and secured by
the auction house two weeks ago.

30:12.602 --> 30:14.604
Now, if this guy’s plan
is gonna work,

30:14.604 --> 30:17.399
he’s gonna have to slip his
bottles into the mix tonight.

30:17.399 --> 30:19.818
But if you’re not here...
we’ll miss our chance.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.695
I don’t see anyone
over there.

30:23.405 --> 30:25.407
We’re the only ones even going
near the Baptiste lot.

30:25.407 --> 30:26.867
No one’s even bidding.

30:26.867 --> 30:28.618
Stop looking.
Just give him privacy

30:28.618 --> 30:32.205
so he can slip in
his poisoned bottles.

30:32.205 --> 30:34.458
Once he makes his move,
the police will jump on it.

30:38.003 --> 30:39.838
(radio chatter)

30:39.838 --> 30:42.007
BELL:
Keith, you got eyes
on the target?

30:42.007 --> 30:43.884
We got a little group
crowding our view

30:43.884 --> 30:45.052
of Lot 49.

30:45.052 --> 30:46.553
Give me the signal
if you see action.

30:50.265 --> 30:51.808
You know,
in my line of work,

30:51.808 --> 30:53.685
we try to minimize
risk and exposure.

30:53.685 --> 30:55.479
WATSON:
That’s exactly

30:55.479 --> 30:57.022
why we’re here.

30:57.022 --> 30:58.815
To get the guy who wants
you dead off the street.

30:58.815 --> 31:01.109
Minimize your risk.
They why do I feel

31:01.109 --> 31:02.944
like I have a giant
bull’s-eye on my chest?

31:02.944 --> 31:04.738
HOLMES:
Even if you did,

31:04.738 --> 31:06.907
the chances are he
wouldn’t be able to hit it.

31:06.907 --> 31:09.743
We think he disposed of
his only weapon in a pond.

31:09.743 --> 31:11.536
Not to mention the fact
that he’s gone to great lengths

31:11.536 --> 31:12.454
not to shoot you.

31:12.454 --> 31:13.955
It suggests
the appeal

31:13.955 --> 31:15.749
of this little
scheme is anonymity.

31:15.749 --> 31:17.959
Wait. Wh-What do you mean?

31:17.959 --> 31:19.961
WATSON:
He means that the killer
probably doesn’t think

31:19.961 --> 31:21.755
he can shoot you
and get away with it.

31:21.755 --> 31:23.381
Poisoning wine that you like,
on the other hand,

31:23.381 --> 31:25.133
wine that anyone here tonight
could have bought,

31:25.133 --> 31:26.885
it would have seemed
more random.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.386
It would have made it
more difficult

31:28.386 --> 31:29.721
for police to identify him.

31:29.721 --> 31:31.932
HOLMES: It also affords
him time to get away.

31:31.932 --> 31:34.017
By the time you’re choking
to death on your own vomit,

31:34.017 --> 31:35.185
he could be
on another continent.

31:36.603 --> 31:38.605
Anyone ever tell you two

31:38.605 --> 31:39.981
your bedside
manner sucks?

31:39.981 --> 31:42.359
Just look for people
you recognize.

31:42.359 --> 31:44.569
Employees.
Corporate rivals.

31:44.569 --> 31:46.446
Any threats at all.

31:53.328 --> 31:54.830
Hey.

31:54.830 --> 31:56.206
Oh.
What’s going on?

31:56.206 --> 31:59.209
Looks like we lost the signal
from the cameras.

31:59.209 --> 32:01.419
We got to see the floor, man.
How long will it take

32:01.419 --> 32:04.047
to get them back?
I got to do this
one at a time.

32:04.047 --> 32:05.048
This venue’s not a bank,
you know?

32:05.048 --> 32:06.633
This is just a temporary setup
for this event.

32:06.633 --> 32:08.426
We’re wireless here.

32:08.426 --> 32:10.345
Well, if we can’t turn
all the cameras back on

32:10.345 --> 32:13.265
at the same time, how did they
all go off at the same time?

32:13.265 --> 32:15.892
Well, the rest of the power’s
still on, so, uh...

32:15.892 --> 32:17.018
I don’t know, signal jammer?

32:19.020 --> 32:21.606
Radio check.
Someone say "copy."

32:21.606 --> 32:23.275
(radio static)
Damn it.

32:23.275 --> 32:24.818
It is a jammer.

32:34.411 --> 32:36.538
What is it?

32:36.538 --> 32:38.957
When we arrived here this
evening, I made small marks

32:38.957 --> 32:42.002
on the labels of the bottles
of Baptiste ’57.

32:42.002 --> 32:44.337
When we passed by three
minutes ago, everything
was as I had left it.

32:44.337 --> 32:46.464
Now two of the bottles
are missing their marks.

32:46.464 --> 32:48.258
He must have made
the switch. How did...

32:48.258 --> 32:50.135
BELL: Hey.
We have a problem.

32:50.135 --> 32:52.304
All the cameras are down,
and somebody jammed the signal.

32:52.304 --> 32:54.347
It’s because they were
ready to make the switch.

32:54.347 --> 32:55.348
Just a moment ago.

32:55.348 --> 32:56.725
WATSON:
He’s still got to be here.

32:56.725 --> 32:58.727
I mean, this space is huge,

32:58.727 --> 33:00.812
and with this crowd,
he can’t just sprint
for the exit.

33:00.812 --> 33:02.814
Please lock the room down, now.

33:02.814 --> 33:04.149
We need to keep him
here with us.

33:04.149 --> 33:05.859
You want me to risk
spooking the killer

33:05.859 --> 33:07.444
and then trap him in here
with a hundred people?

33:07.444 --> 33:09.821
Do you want
to catch him or not?

33:09.821 --> 33:12.490
Keith! Seal the exit.

33:12.490 --> 33:15.869
Ladies and gentlemen,
I’m Detective Marcus Bell,

33:15.869 --> 33:18.705
NYPD.
Sorry to ruin your evening,

33:18.705 --> 33:21.666
but this is a police matter--
I need you all to remain calm.

33:21.666 --> 33:22.709
This room just became
a crime scene.

33:30.759 --> 33:33.053
Signal jammer that knocked
out the security cameras,

33:33.053 --> 33:34.304
it was in a potted plant.

33:34.304 --> 33:35.472
Killer smuggled it in,

33:35.472 --> 33:37.474
flipped it on when he
was ready to make the swap.

33:37.474 --> 33:39.309
Did CSU find any prints?

33:39.309 --> 33:41.770
No. They’re not optimistic
we’ll be able to pull one

33:41.770 --> 33:43.271
off the poisoned bottles
he planted, either.

33:43.271 --> 33:45.106
Any luck with the guests?

33:45.106 --> 33:46.483
An impressive cross section
of Manhattan’s elite.

33:46.483 --> 33:48.902
I reckon half of them
are capable of homicide.

33:48.902 --> 33:52.155
Nobody jumps out for the murders
we’ve been looking into?

33:52.155 --> 33:54.574
Jason and Corinna said they
don’t recognize anyone here.

33:54.574 --> 33:57.744
Then we got nothing.
We have to let these people go.

33:57.744 --> 33:59.829
I’m convinced the killer
is in this room with us.

33:59.829 --> 34:01.206
You might be right...

34:01.206 --> 34:03.250
Might?
I’m aware of your track record,

34:03.250 --> 34:04.793
but knowing he’s here
and proving it

34:04.793 --> 34:05.877
are two different things.

34:05.877 --> 34:07.170
The folks in this room
have half

34:07.170 --> 34:09.005
the New York Bar Association
on retainer.

34:09.005 --> 34:10.423
I can’t detain them indefinitely

34:10.423 --> 34:12.175
until we can tie someone
to the crime.

34:12.175 --> 34:14.427
Sorry.

34:23.436 --> 34:25.647
Wait.

34:25.647 --> 34:27.482
It’s him.

34:27.482 --> 34:28.608
I know you.

34:28.608 --> 34:31.027
You’re the bartender,
Colby, right?

34:31.027 --> 34:33.196
Didn’t recognize you
without the beard and the hat.

34:33.196 --> 34:34.823
What are you doing here?

34:34.823 --> 34:36.449
I like wine.
Is that a crime?

34:36.449 --> 34:39.494
No. But murder, conspiracy
and animal cruelty are.

34:39.494 --> 34:41.413
The knots on his shoes,
they’re figure eight
packer’s knots.

34:41.413 --> 34:42.789
Rarely seen outside
the meat industry.

34:42.789 --> 34:44.582
Your father a butcher?

34:44.582 --> 34:46.793
They’re identical
to the knots used

34:46.793 --> 34:48.628
to tie rocks
to Renny Henderson and his hog

34:48.628 --> 34:50.046
to make him sink
in Richmond Pond.

34:50.046 --> 34:51.464
They look like the bindings

34:51.464 --> 34:53.633
that were around
Todd Harris’s hands, too.

34:53.633 --> 34:56.219
You might as well
have signed your crimes.
Come on.

34:56.219 --> 34:58.471
You think I’m a criminal
because of my shoelaces?

34:58.471 --> 35:00.724
Actually, mate,
knot forensics have been used

35:00.724 --> 35:02.767
to identify the culprits
in many cases,

35:02.767 --> 35:04.352
all of them
prosecuted successfully,

35:04.352 --> 35:05.603
as I’m certain yours will be.

35:10.483 --> 35:12.360
DWYER:
So, this fella,

35:12.360 --> 35:14.321
he breaks into
Todd Harris’s home,

35:14.321 --> 35:16.239
steals his wine,
shoots him,

35:16.239 --> 35:18.491
takes the bottles
to Renny Henderson.

35:18.491 --> 35:20.118
Forces him
to make ricin,

35:20.118 --> 35:21.995
tests it on Renny’s pig,
which kills the pig.

35:21.995 --> 35:23.955
He kills Renny, too.

35:23.955 --> 35:25.248
Then he kills
Isabel Perez

35:25.248 --> 35:27.000
to cover it up
just so he could fail

35:27.000 --> 35:28.293
to poison his actual target.

35:28.293 --> 35:29.419
He had a busy week.

35:29.419 --> 35:32.005
Someone should
have told this idiot

35:32.005 --> 35:33.715
there are simpler ways
to kill a man.

35:33.715 --> 35:37.177
Maybe not if you’re hoping
to get away with it.

35:37.177 --> 35:39.346
His plan wasn’t complicated;
it was deliberately designed

35:39.346 --> 35:41.389
to obscure his involvement.

35:41.389 --> 35:43.391
He would inevitably be
the prime suspect

35:43.391 --> 35:45.643
in any direct attack
on the Woods.

35:45.643 --> 35:47.771
Why is that?
Because he’s
been obsessed

35:47.771 --> 35:49.397
with Corinna Wood
for a long time.

35:49.397 --> 35:51.149
Ever since high school, in fact.

35:51.149 --> 35:53.151
They grew up in
Montana together,

35:53.151 --> 35:54.611
and he followed her to New York.
He was arrested

35:54.611 --> 35:56.946
for stalking her.
He served five years

35:56.946 --> 35:59.824
for that and an unrelated
weapons charge.

35:59.824 --> 36:01.534
You were right--
that’s why he

36:01.534 --> 36:03.286
couldn’t get his hands
on a decent weapon.

36:03.286 --> 36:04.829
HOLMES:
While he was inside,

36:04.829 --> 36:06.456
he read that Corinna
had got married,

36:06.456 --> 36:07.874
and that outraged him.

36:07.874 --> 36:09.918
She was his
and his alone.

36:09.918 --> 36:12.128
But how was he gonna get rid
of her interloping spouse?

36:12.128 --> 36:14.464
Inspiration struck

36:14.464 --> 36:16.383
when he found out
that Corinna’s new husband

36:16.383 --> 36:18.885
had a taste
for Chateau Baptiste ’57.

36:18.885 --> 36:20.470
Well, if the wife knew the guy,

36:20.470 --> 36:21.888
how come she didn’t
recognize him at the auction?

36:21.888 --> 36:24.682
Because the last time she saw
him, he was 200 pounds heavier.

36:24.682 --> 36:26.559
He lost all the
weight in prison.

36:28.937 --> 36:31.106
Always inspiring
to see a convict

36:31.106 --> 36:32.357
using their time productively.

36:32.357 --> 36:33.650
Perhaps this
time around,

36:33.650 --> 36:34.859
he’ll write
the Great American Novel.

36:34.859 --> 36:36.528
I suppose he’ll have

36:36.528 --> 36:38.405
the rest of his life
to figure it out.

36:43.701 --> 36:46.329
HOLMES:
"When an archer misses
the center of the target,

36:46.329 --> 36:48.665
"he turns around

36:48.665 --> 36:51.167
and looks for the cause of
his failure within himself."

36:51.167 --> 36:53.586
I like Confucius
as much as the next guy,

36:53.586 --> 36:56.756
but sometimes the wind blows.
If you have
a moment,

36:56.756 --> 36:59.426
we’d like to discuss the matter
of your niece, Mr. Reichenbach.

36:59.426 --> 37:02.220
Oh, you can call me Odin.
All my friends do.

37:02.220 --> 37:03.847
I haven’t decided
if we’re going to be friends.

37:03.847 --> 37:05.056
WATSON:
We came to tell you

37:05.056 --> 37:06.182
that Abigail is safe.

37:06.182 --> 37:09.227
(sighs):
Well, that is a relief.

37:09.227 --> 37:12.439
So... who sent
the kidnapping threats?

37:12.439 --> 37:14.899
There is no kidnapping
threat. Never was.

37:14.899 --> 37:17.444
Watson and I vetted
every Odker employee

37:17.444 --> 37:19.988
on the list of suspects
that you gave us.

37:19.988 --> 37:22.031
None of them sent
any letters.

37:22.031 --> 37:24.325
WATSON: We visited your
sister this morning--
we told her that

37:24.325 --> 37:26.745
we hit a wall
and asked her if she could think

37:26.745 --> 37:28.997
of anyone close to her that
might have sent the threats.

37:28.997 --> 37:30.915
Maybe they didn’t come
from inside Odker after all.

37:30.915 --> 37:33.710
She had no idea what
we were talking about.

37:33.710 --> 37:35.003
Said she never
received any threats.

37:35.003 --> 37:36.588
You sent us

37:36.588 --> 37:38.590
on a wild goose chase;
we’d like to know why.

37:38.590 --> 37:39.841
It was a test.

37:39.841 --> 37:42.010
You passed.

37:42.010 --> 37:44.721
Our renown as detectives

37:44.721 --> 37:47.432
is the reason you hired
us in the first place.

37:47.432 --> 37:49.476
So testing our skills is
completely unnecessary.

37:49.476 --> 37:51.853
It wasn’t your skills
I was testing.

37:51.853 --> 37:52.937
It was the two of you.

37:55.148 --> 37:57.275
I told you my niece
was in danger,

37:57.275 --> 37:59.819
and you did everything
in your power to help her.

37:59.819 --> 38:01.779
Everything.
Whether it was legal or not.

38:01.779 --> 38:03.573
You don’t know
what steps we took.

38:03.573 --> 38:05.617
I do.

38:05.617 --> 38:08.578
You solicited an illegal search
of my employee’s bank records.

38:08.578 --> 38:10.371
You broke into his home.

38:10.371 --> 38:12.373
You broke more
than a dozen laws.

38:12.373 --> 38:14.334
Don’t worry, you’ve
nothing to fear from me.

38:14.334 --> 38:16.127
Right now, I’m on your side.

38:16.127 --> 38:17.921
I’d do anything to protect
an innocent person.

38:17.921 --> 38:20.131
It’s an impulse

38:20.131 --> 38:22.842
I think we share with someone
you’ve apprehended recently.

38:22.842 --> 38:24.219
Patrick Meers.

38:27.013 --> 38:29.766
We were looking for the people
he was working for.

38:29.766 --> 38:31.559
You’re one of
them, aren’t you?

38:31.559 --> 38:33.728
You’ve been laboring
under the misconception

38:33.728 --> 38:36.606
that Patrick is
some sort of terrorist.

38:36.606 --> 38:38.608
That’s not true. In fact,
I’d call him a patriot.

38:38.608 --> 38:40.318
The world could use
more people like him.

38:40.318 --> 38:42.153
In fact,
I’d like to think

38:42.153 --> 38:44.447
I’m looking
at two of them right now.

38:44.447 --> 38:46.616
Our friend was shot
and almost killed,

38:46.616 --> 38:48.785
and you just admitted
you were behind it.
I didn’t tell

38:48.785 --> 38:50.453
Patrick Meers
to kill your captain.

38:50.453 --> 38:51.996
He made a mess.

38:51.996 --> 38:53.957
He made his own decisions
about cleaning it up

38:53.957 --> 38:56.960
and I am very sorry for it.
Sorry enough

38:56.960 --> 38:58.628
to admit your involvement
to the NYPD?

38:58.628 --> 39:00.713
All I did

39:00.713 --> 39:03.132
was tell Patrick what I’d
learned about Tim Bledsoe.

39:03.132 --> 39:05.677
I had reason to believe
that an army veteran

39:05.677 --> 39:07.637
with his psychological makeup

39:07.637 --> 39:10.139
would take steps to avoid
a tragedy, and he did.

39:10.139 --> 39:12.267
What happened next was
also tragic, but...

39:12.267 --> 39:14.310
(takes deep breath)
...I am a practical man,

39:14.310 --> 39:16.271
and 200 lives were saved.

39:16.271 --> 39:18.481
I’d like to talk about that.

39:18.481 --> 39:21.442
We speak with murderers on a
regular basis, Mr. Reichenbach.

39:21.442 --> 39:23.319
Do you imagine any of them

39:23.319 --> 39:25.154
convinced us of
their righteousness?

39:25.154 --> 39:26.573
Perhaps you
should consider

39:26.573 --> 39:29.284
the possibility
that I am not the kind of man

39:29.284 --> 39:31.286
you deal with
on a regular basis.
