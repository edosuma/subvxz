WEBVTT

00:03.939 --> 00:05.984
Psst. Do you know
why we're sitting here?

00:06.028 --> 00:08.160
I dunno, but I think
Dad's having a meltdown.

00:08.204 --> 00:09.597
Dad is not having a meltdown!

00:09.640 --> 00:11.816
-Kay.

00:11.860 --> 00:13.514
OK.

00:13.557 --> 00:15.646
So, I was checking our books,

00:15.690 --> 00:21.130
and vegetable stand is broke.

00:21.173 --> 00:22.479
What?!
What, seriously?

00:22.523 --> 00:24.002
Which means we need to sell

00:24.046 --> 00:25.874
all of our fruits
and vegetables today.

00:25.917 --> 00:27.025
Or else I'll lose my livelihood

00:27.049 --> 00:28.200
and I don't know if I'll be able

00:28.224 --> 00:29.747
to feed or clothe any of you.

00:29.791 --> 00:31.401
Woof.

00:31.444 --> 00:32.857
How are we supposed to sell
all of our vegetables?

00:32.881 --> 00:34.273
That never happens!

00:34.317 --> 00:36.711
Cricket, we're gonna work
together as a family

00:36.754 --> 00:38.451
to save the farm.

00:39.888 --> 00:42.107
Woo, yeah!
What can I do to help?

00:42.151 --> 00:44.806
Oh, hi Gloria.
I forgot that you lived here.

00:44.849 --> 00:47.199
Don't worry about it,
we've got it under control.

00:47.243 --> 00:51.029
What? If you're in this much
trouble, you must need
some extra hands.

00:51.073 --> 00:53.815
Look, it's... uh, farm stuff.

00:53.858 --> 00:56.121
Selling vegetables
isn't like making lattes.

00:56.165 --> 00:59.864
You can feed the chickens
for me. That's exactly
like making lattes.

00:59.908 --> 01:02.650
Cricket, how are you
making lattes?

01:02.693 --> 01:04.303
Seriously, don't worry about it.

01:04.347 --> 01:06.654
Not everyone's cut out
for farming. And that's OK.

01:06.697 --> 01:08.525
Yeah, lots of people
can't do stuff.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.092
I still think you're cool,
Gloria.

01:10.135 --> 01:11.789
- See?
- Uh, but...

01:11.833 --> 01:13.661
So, we'll go save
the vegetable stand,

01:13.704 --> 01:15.837
while you stay here
and hang out!

01:15.880 --> 01:18.100
You can keep chillaxin'
to the maxin'.

01:18.143 --> 01:19.928
Everyone else?
We sell, or we starve.

01:22.147 --> 01:25.803
They think I'm useless! Ugh.

01:25.847 --> 01:27.979
I know. I'll feed
Cricket's chickens.

01:28.023 --> 01:31.113
That'll prove
ol' Gloria's worth.

01:31.156 --> 01:34.595
Hmm. Chicken food,
chicken food.

01:34.638 --> 01:36.379
I mean, how hard can this be?

01:36.422 --> 01:38.990
Everyone likes bananas.
They're healthy.

01:39.034 --> 01:41.993
Oh, wow.
There's a lot of you, huh?

01:42.037 --> 01:43.734
-Well, I hope you...

01:43.778 --> 01:46.345
-Oh no! Chickens, come back!

01:47.520 --> 01:48.870
OK guys, huddle up.

01:48.913 --> 01:50.698
We need a game plan
to sell these veggies.

01:50.741 --> 01:52.482
No idea's a bad idea.

01:52.525 --> 01:53.918
So, what've you got for me?

01:53.962 --> 01:55.833
Selling is all about publicity.

01:55.877 --> 01:59.010
And what would bring in
more publicity than
a publicity stunt?

01:59.054 --> 02:00.969
Sales are about
a personal connection.

02:01.012 --> 02:02.666
I will therefore connect,

02:02.710 --> 02:05.887
and build an empire of commerce
using only my eyes.

02:05.930 --> 02:07.671
Fear's what motivates sales!

02:07.715 --> 02:10.674
That's how you sell diet soda
and insurance.

02:10.718 --> 02:12.676
All 10 out of 10 ideas, family.

02:12.720 --> 02:13.808
Three, two, one...

02:13.851 --> 02:14.983
Sale!

02:15.026 --> 02:17.725
Green family farm forever!

02:17.768 --> 02:20.162
And now, to man
the cash register.

02:20.205 --> 02:22.686
Aah! I forgot
the cash register!

02:22.730 --> 02:24.949
It's time for Tilly tactics.

02:24.993 --> 02:26.995
Let's make
a personal connection.

02:27.038 --> 02:28.649
Hey, you in the red coat!

02:28.692 --> 02:31.434
- Uh, me?
- Yes, you. Come to Tilly.

02:31.477 --> 02:32.783
Uh, OK.

02:32.827 --> 02:34.655
- What's your name?
- Angela.

02:34.698 --> 02:36.787
Angela! What a beautiful name.

02:36.831 --> 02:38.223
Uh, thank you?

02:38.267 --> 02:39.921
Now tell me, Angela,

02:39.964 --> 02:41.764
would you like to buy
some vegetables from me?

02:41.792 --> 02:42.967
Uh, no thank you.

02:43.011 --> 02:44.926
Ah, we'll just have
to keep gazing

02:44.969 --> 02:46.928
until we've made a strong
personal connection

02:46.971 --> 02:49.670
that motivates you
to buy our vegetables.

02:49.713 --> 02:51.149
I... um...

02:51.193 --> 02:53.891
Ba-ba-ba.
Don't break eye contact.

02:53.935 --> 02:55.937
Just look at me.

02:55.980 --> 02:57.895
Come one, come all!

02:57.939 --> 03:01.159
To the Green family farm's
publicity stunt spectacular!

03:01.203 --> 03:03.509
Prepare to have
your minds blown!

03:03.553 --> 03:05.729
Your boons daggled!

03:05.773 --> 03:09.254
All taking place at the Green
family farm's booth
this afternoon!

03:09.298 --> 03:10.473
Wanna go check it out?

03:10.516 --> 03:11.474
Uh, sure.

03:11.517 --> 03:13.519
That's the spirit!

03:13.563 --> 03:17.785
OK, Alice, let's scare
the dollars right
out of their wallets.

03:17.828 --> 03:19.438
Oh, boy! Hot dog time!

03:19.482 --> 03:22.006
Hot dog time! Hot dog time!
Hot dog?

03:22.050 --> 03:25.836
Don't you know what
this unhealthy garbage
does to you?

03:25.880 --> 03:27.185
Fills up my tummy yummy yummy?

03:27.229 --> 03:29.448
No! It'll make your bones rot!

03:29.492 --> 03:31.015
Eat your vegetables, you idiot!

03:31.059 --> 03:33.017
- Gimme that!
- La la la la... ooh!

03:33.061 --> 03:36.020
Ice cream'll make
your hair fall out!

03:36.064 --> 03:38.980
Fruits and veggies are the only
things keeping us alive!

03:39.023 --> 03:41.025
If you don't eat enough veggies,

03:41.069 --> 03:42.723
your body will shrivel up!

03:42.766 --> 03:44.507
Like a grape in the sun!

03:44.550 --> 03:45.900
Just look at me!

03:45.943 --> 03:49.207
I'm only 25!

03:50.731 --> 03:51.882
And make sure you buy
your produce

03:51.906 --> 03:54.778
at Green family farms.

03:54.822 --> 03:59.609
We'll be raking in the dough
with the stand in no time.

04:05.223 --> 04:06.790
Ha! Gotcha!

04:06.834 --> 04:08.618
See? I can farm!

04:08.661 --> 04:10.141
-Actually...

04:10.185 --> 04:12.665
You're pretty cool looking
for a chicken.

04:12.709 --> 04:14.929
Gonna just post this.

04:14.972 --> 04:16.495
Hashtag it up.

04:16.539 --> 04:18.584
-Hm?

04:18.628 --> 04:20.195
I left the chicken door open!

04:20.238 --> 04:22.632
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

04:22.675 --> 04:24.329
The Greens' chickens!

04:24.373 --> 04:27.680
No, no, no, no!

04:28.856 --> 04:30.901
Do chickens understand busses?

04:35.166 --> 04:36.951
-Did you know about this?

04:36.994 --> 04:38.996
Chickens!

04:39.040 --> 04:40.693
Alright, everyone, this way

04:40.737 --> 04:43.740
for the Cricket Green
publicity stunt spectacular!

04:43.784 --> 04:46.438
Wow, son. You sure were able
to bring in a lot of customers.

04:46.482 --> 04:49.659
Oh, it was easy once I told
them about my big fat stunt.

04:49.702 --> 04:51.226
What exactly are you gonna do?

04:51.269 --> 04:53.097
Well, father, I thought
you'd never ask.

04:53.141 --> 04:55.143
Take a look! I built a ramp

04:55.186 --> 04:57.145
out of old rickety crates
from the dumpster.

04:57.188 --> 04:59.060
Which I am going to ride down.

04:59.103 --> 05:01.845
Then I'll hit the jump,
fly over the farmers market,

05:01.889 --> 05:03.499
smash into the center
of the bullseye,

05:03.542 --> 05:06.197
then for safety I'll fall into
that precariously balanced

05:06.241 --> 05:07.851
bucket of water on a stick.

05:07.895 --> 05:10.288
Simultaneously cleaning me,
while activating

05:10.332 --> 05:13.248
the bath bombs I've taped
to mine bare buttocks

05:13.291 --> 05:14.815
launching me straight
into the air,

05:14.858 --> 05:18.122
and exploding
for a bubbly finale!

05:18.166 --> 05:19.950
Wow.

05:19.994 --> 05:23.127
Oh, and did I mention
that I'll be covered in honey?

05:25.260 --> 05:28.002
Hold on. How does that
help us sell vegetables?

05:28.045 --> 05:31.005
You tell me. You're already
manning the merch table.

05:31.048 --> 05:32.049
Merch table?

05:32.093 --> 05:34.878
"Cricket's stunt. I was there."

05:34.922 --> 05:37.402
Well, I'll be. You really think
this is gonna work?

05:37.446 --> 05:40.231
Trust me, Dad. I'm a genius.

05:40.275 --> 05:42.059
Show starts in 5, people!

05:42.103 --> 05:43.844
Gee, Cricket's sure
giving it his all.

05:43.887 --> 05:47.848
How're you
doing, sweetie? Hm.

05:47.891 --> 05:50.589
So tell me, Angela,
what do you fear?

05:50.633 --> 05:52.287
I guess, being alone forever.

05:52.330 --> 05:53.897
Wait. Why did I tell you that?

05:53.941 --> 05:55.986
Because our connection
grows stronger.

05:56.030 --> 05:58.684
Soon you will be purchasing
a bounty of our vegetables.

05:58.728 --> 06:00.599
Do you feel it, Angela?

06:00.643 --> 06:02.340
I don't know. I'm scared.

06:04.821 --> 06:07.476
Aah! Ew!
Our eyeballs touched! Oh!

06:07.519 --> 06:08.912
Drat.

06:08.956 --> 06:10.392
You gotta eat fruits and veggies

06:10.435 --> 06:12.524
from Green's family farm!

06:12.568 --> 06:16.050
You! You would've gotten
into law school if you ate
more broccoli!

06:16.093 --> 06:17.921
It's true!

06:17.965 --> 06:21.272
Don't I know it? Ain't no one
nothing without their veggies!

06:21.316 --> 06:23.884
-Ain't no one... Whoa, there.

06:23.927 --> 06:25.755
What's with all
the commotion, Mrs. Green?

06:25.798 --> 06:26.930
Stay outta this, Keys.

06:26.974 --> 06:29.715
It ain't illegal
to sell tomatoes.

06:29.759 --> 06:33.458
Well, no, but it is illegal
to harass all of these people.

06:33.502 --> 06:35.678
You ungrateful snitches!

06:35.721 --> 06:37.941
Well, if that's the way
it's gonna be,

06:37.985 --> 06:41.118
I ain't going out
without a fight! Hi-yah!

06:41.162 --> 06:45.862
Attacking a police officer is
a serious offence.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.690
You're coming with me.

06:47.733 --> 06:49.300
I failed as a businesswoman.

06:49.344 --> 06:51.694
My plan went belly-up, Papa.

06:51.737 --> 06:54.915
You tried your best,
sweetie, and I'm sure
everything will be OK.

06:54.958 --> 06:56.038
Maybe Gramma's plan will...

06:57.569 --> 06:59.832
You earned yourself
a stay in time out!

06:59.876 --> 07:03.053
No cell can hold me!
Just you wait!

07:03.097 --> 07:05.664
Our fate is
in Cricket's hands, now.

07:05.708 --> 07:07.405
Hmm.

07:11.801 --> 07:16.414
Oh! Chickens! Why? Ugh.

07:16.458 --> 07:19.156
They actually took the bus
to the farmers market?

07:19.200 --> 07:21.811
Where the Greens are? No!

07:21.854 --> 07:25.554
OK. It's up to me and Gramma
to save the stand.

07:25.597 --> 07:29.123
Cricket! Gramma's out!
It's up to you, now!

07:29.166 --> 07:31.560
So it goes.

07:31.603 --> 07:33.127
-Yah!

07:33.170 --> 07:35.390
Green family farm forever!

07:35.433 --> 07:37.131
Yah!

07:37.174 --> 07:40.830
I'm gonna buy a ton of produce
from their stand if this works!

07:42.440 --> 07:46.401
Yah-ha-ha-ha-ha!

07:46.444 --> 07:51.710
Aah!

07:57.847 --> 08:00.023
Boo! Disappointing!

08:00.067 --> 08:02.243
-Oh, my.

08:02.286 --> 08:03.853
Hello?

08:03.896 --> 08:06.943
We'll continue this time out
back at the station.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.901
Just as soon as I find my keys.

08:08.945 --> 08:11.556
-Hey! I know you!

08:16.822 --> 08:18.520
Wait, are these our chickens?

08:18.563 --> 08:21.871
They are! But shouldn't they be
at home with Gloria?

08:21.914 --> 08:23.481
Yes. They should be.

08:23.525 --> 08:25.483
Hi Mr. Green.

08:25.527 --> 08:27.920
Gloria. Did you let out
all of our chickens?

08:27.964 --> 08:30.532
Yes! Jeez.

08:30.575 --> 08:34.405
Hello everyone.
It's true. I am useless.

08:34.449 --> 08:37.147
I couldn't even feed
chickens, and now
they're all over the place.

08:37.191 --> 08:38.844
Well, don't worry about them.

08:38.888 --> 08:40.716
You just didn't know to never
open up the coop

08:40.759 --> 08:42.152
when Tilly's out of the house.

08:42.196 --> 08:44.372
Look! They'd travel
any distance for her.

08:44.415 --> 08:46.722
Come to me, my poopy angels.

08:46.765 --> 08:49.942
I know you were just trying
to help, but no one's
good at everything.

08:49.986 --> 08:51.988
Don't worry, Gloria.
We're useless, too.

08:52.032 --> 08:54.034
We didn't sell anything today!

08:54.077 --> 08:56.775
Mm-hmm. Lots of vegetables
still on the stand.

08:56.819 --> 08:57.863
Yeah, that ain't good.

08:57.907 --> 08:59.517
I guess we still have some time.

08:59.561 --> 09:01.693
Come on, y'all, let's make
ourselves useful.

09:03.695 --> 09:06.089
Hoopa-doop! Hey Greens,
check it out!

09:06.133 --> 09:09.745
I posted this picture of one
of your chickens this morning,
because she looked cool,

09:09.788 --> 09:10.746
Yeah, I can see it.

09:10.789 --> 09:11.790
I hashtagged it "cool,"

09:11.834 --> 09:13.053
"chicken," and "cool chicken,"

09:13.096 --> 09:14.837
and it went viral!

09:14.880 --> 09:16.839
Gloria, I don't understand.

09:16.882 --> 09:18.101
Are you all on social?

09:18.145 --> 09:19.189
Uh...

09:19.233 --> 09:21.061
OK, well, you should be!

09:21.104 --> 09:22.932
That way people will know
what you're selling.

09:22.975 --> 09:24.934
Take a pic,
and throw on a filter,

09:24.977 --> 09:27.197
hot stuff! Ready to post.

09:27.241 --> 09:29.939
Wow, Gloria, you're
like a doctor at this!

09:29.982 --> 09:31.897
Yeah, I am good at this!

09:31.941 --> 09:34.248
Hey, Bill, do you have any
extra shirts in your truck?

09:34.291 --> 09:36.511
Yes. And why?

09:36.554 --> 09:39.905
Instant uniforms!

09:39.949 --> 09:41.907
Huh. Now, that's an idea.

09:46.956 --> 09:50.655
Number sign, potato.
I'm an influencer!

09:50.699 --> 09:52.309
Hey, all! Still going good?

09:52.353 --> 09:55.486
Yeah, Gloria.
We're selling tons!
Thank you.

09:55.530 --> 09:57.575
Yeah, we even got a customer
who saw your post

09:57.619 --> 09:59.795
and drove all the way
from Medium City!

09:59.838 --> 10:02.014
Medium City, Gloria!

10:02.058 --> 10:04.191
And these uniforms are
really doing stuff!

10:04.234 --> 10:06.932
I'll take these tomatoes,
young man.

10:06.976 --> 10:09.370
How's that? I just sold
the last vegetable!

10:09.413 --> 10:11.633
The stand is saved!

10:11.676 --> 10:14.810
I dunno. Looks like we still
have a coconut in there.

10:14.853 --> 10:15.985
I get it.

10:16.028 --> 10:17.943
Sorry for dismissing
you earlier.

10:17.987 --> 10:19.858
I should've seen you
for what you could do.

10:19.902 --> 10:21.947
Instead of what you couldn't.

10:21.991 --> 10:24.187
It was very cool of you
to save our behinds
like you did.

10:24.211 --> 10:26.343
Yeah. It was cool

10:26.387 --> 10:28.954
Man. Not as cool
as that chicken!
