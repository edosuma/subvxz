WEBVTT

00:00.195 --> 00:01.841
This man had Bannantine killed.

00:01.843 --> 00:05.238
Accident...
Accident at Wheal Plenty!

00:05.240 --> 00:08.678
In Sir George's absence I have taken
the decision to close the mine.

00:08.680 --> 00:11.358
And the livelihoods
of those who survived?

00:11.360 --> 00:13.038
Would you tell me how
John Conan is?

00:13.040 --> 00:14.398
It is best for all concerned

00:14.400 --> 00:16.958
that both parties forget
the other exists.

00:16.960 --> 00:19.398
She would have made it her
business to love any one I...

00:19.400 --> 00:20.600
..admire.

00:21.800 --> 00:23.158
Think highly of.

00:23.160 --> 00:25.238
You'd like to see some books?

00:25.240 --> 00:29.158
Since Sir George is in such
a benevolent mood, perhaps he'd care

00:29.160 --> 00:33.198
to fund his stepson's
first year at military academy.

00:33.200 --> 00:36.118
Sir George is clearly suffering
from the acute distress of losing

00:36.120 --> 00:37.318
a beloved wife.

00:37.320 --> 00:39.238
He requires kindness and patience.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.318
Your intervention
has drawn attention

00:41.320 --> 00:42.758
to an unfortunate situation.

00:42.760 --> 00:44.840
Now the crown requires you
to make amends.

01:33.040 --> 01:34.918
So...

01:34.920 --> 01:37.318
..having been at Westminster
two months...

01:37.320 --> 01:38.678
But I am an MP.

01:38.680 --> 01:41.038
..leaving Despard behind
in Cornwall...

01:41.040 --> 01:43.438
He was disinclined to share
Bannantine's fate.

01:43.440 --> 01:46.118
As you seem disinclined to carry out
the task I assigned you.

01:46.120 --> 01:47.918
There's nothing to report.

01:47.920 --> 01:50.398
Ned is law-abiding, uncomplaining.

01:50.400 --> 01:52.838
His only wish is to return
to Honduras

01:52.840 --> 01:54.358
and serve his country.

01:54.360 --> 01:57.160
Is there really no way
that can be managed?

01:58.560 --> 01:59.760
There might be...

02:01.640 --> 02:03.798
..if he behaves himself
until parliament resumes.

02:03.800 --> 02:06.758
-He will.
-And if he did not, you would of course inform me.

02:06.760 --> 02:08.118
I assure you, sir.

02:08.120 --> 02:09.398
He's a changed man.

02:09.400 --> 02:11.718
I hope you're right.

02:11.720 --> 02:13.680
I wish you a speedy return
to Cornwall.

02:17.720 --> 02:19.240
Good day.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.240
Sweet Cornish air! How I welcome it.

02:30.440 --> 02:34.078
At Marlow, my billet
stinks of boot polish and feet.

02:34.080 --> 02:35.360
Whoa!

02:39.960 --> 02:41.118
I thank you.

02:41.120 --> 02:42.238
Miss Hanson!

02:42.240 --> 02:44.758
Gentleman, an unexpected encounter.

02:44.760 --> 02:45.920
Good evening.

02:53.800 --> 02:55.158
Have you been in London?

02:55.160 --> 02:57.598
No. An odious place.

02:57.600 --> 02:58.638
Bristol.

02:58.640 --> 03:01.358
On shipping matters, no doubt.

03:01.360 --> 03:02.598
The usual cargo.

03:02.600 --> 03:05.238
Those of us with an unsentimental
view of the trade

03:05.240 --> 03:08.400
see it for what it is - a necessary
means to a desirable end.

03:09.920 --> 03:12.158
So what brings you to Truro again?

03:12.160 --> 03:14.158
Do you expect to find slaves here?

03:14.160 --> 03:17.118
What would you call the poor devils
who work in your mines?

03:17.120 --> 03:18.198
Well paid.

03:18.200 --> 03:19.280
Valued.

03:20.440 --> 03:21.640
Respected.

03:23.240 --> 03:24.440
Free.

03:27.080 --> 03:29.638
How are the Colonel and Mrs Despard?

03:29.640 --> 03:31.998
Planning their return to
Honduras, I trust.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.480
Is that on the cards?

03:36.520 --> 03:37.600
Very much so.

03:40.560 --> 03:42.678
Why...? Why...?

03:42.680 --> 03:44.400
Why is she...?

03:46.880 --> 03:48.000
Why...?

03:49.360 --> 03:50.918
Why is she not here?

03:50.920 --> 03:52.360
Where is she?

03:55.000 --> 03:56.400
When will she come?

04:01.160 --> 04:02.800
Where is my Elizabeth?

04:11.720 --> 04:13.478
Is this not a welcome sight?!

04:13.480 --> 04:14.598
Let me look at you.

04:14.600 --> 04:16.998
Lord, Ross,
these absences try me hard.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.998
Well, now you have a
brace of Poldarks to make up for it.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.197
Ah!

04:21.200 --> 04:22.440
Aunt Demelza.

04:25.240 --> 04:26.560
How are our guests?

04:27.720 --> 04:29.358
Kitty seems a little subdued.

04:29.360 --> 04:30.478
And Ned?

04:30.480 --> 04:31.960
Welcome home, friend!

04:36.200 --> 04:38.878
You have a reception committee.

04:38.880 --> 04:40.958
I give you...

04:40.960 --> 04:44.278
..six households in Sawle
evicted for non-payment of rent.

04:44.280 --> 04:46.598
All former workers at Wheal Plenty.

04:46.600 --> 04:49.358
Scurvy in Grambler
and no fresh fruit to be had,

04:49.360 --> 04:52.198
and all the poor relief in Cornwall
cannot get a fixed price for grain.

04:52.200 --> 04:53.400
No change there.

04:57.440 --> 05:00.598
Forgive me.
I must beg your indulgence a while.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.158
You're disaffected, I know,

05:02.160 --> 05:05.518
but if you give me your,
your names and grievances,

05:05.520 --> 05:08.118
I'll make it my business
to attend to them.

05:08.120 --> 05:09.278
There you are, sir.

05:09.280 --> 05:11.158
-Is the world set to rights?
-Not yet.

05:11.160 --> 05:13.678
But I've given out
that, from noon tomorrow,

05:13.680 --> 05:15.598
anyone with a complaint
should seek me here.

05:15.600 --> 05:18.518
A member who listens
to his constituents?

05:18.520 --> 05:19.638
That's a novel idea.

05:19.640 --> 05:21.198
Do you think George
will do the like?

05:21.200 --> 05:23.358
If George won't go to his people,

05:23.360 --> 05:26.198
perhaps the people should
hunt him down.

05:26.200 --> 05:27.400
Slainte.

05:33.400 --> 05:34.798
It's a wishing well.

05:34.800 --> 05:38.078
You put your hand into the water,
close your eyes,

05:38.080 --> 05:41.158
say, "Father, Son and Holy Ghost,"

05:41.160 --> 05:42.798
and then your wish is granted.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.480
Let's test your theory.

05:48.040 --> 05:49.720
Father, Son and Holy Ghost.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.278
Guess what I wished for.

05:55.280 --> 05:56.520
Oh, you mustn't tell.

05:58.040 --> 05:59.400
For then it won't come true.

06:01.720 --> 06:03.560
I'm ravenous.
Shall we go to Nampara?

06:06.160 --> 06:07.998
Why is she not here?

06:08.000 --> 06:09.838
It's so unlike her.

06:09.840 --> 06:11.358
We have things to discuss.

06:11.360 --> 06:13.358
She knows her opinion
is essential to me.

06:13.360 --> 06:15.920
Let the grounds be searched.
Let her be found - brought back.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.798
I cannot go forward without her.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.878
There's no point, no sense,

06:20.880 --> 06:22.838
no reason, no cause.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.958
Why do you delay? Go and find her.

06:24.960 --> 06:26.200
Find her!

06:37.880 --> 06:40.280
My wish came true.
I wished for cake.

06:41.720 --> 06:43.958
You never questioned why she's here.

06:43.960 --> 06:45.558
Is it not obvious?

06:45.560 --> 06:48.558
Or convenient. The daughter of the
man who had Bannantine killed.

06:48.560 --> 06:51.398
We do not know of his involvement.

06:51.400 --> 06:53.358
But we know he's connected.

06:53.360 --> 06:55.318
So now here she is, in our midst.

06:55.320 --> 06:57.078
Talk about the sins of the fathers.

06:57.080 --> 06:59.518
Yes, let's do so, for those sins
have not been paid for.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.678
-When will he be held to account?
-Sh.

07:01.680 --> 07:03.800
When your return to
Honduras has been secured.

07:04.920 --> 07:05.958
If ever, that is.

07:05.960 --> 07:09.118
As I told you, I'm assured
it's only a matter of time.

07:09.120 --> 07:10.638
Do you truly believe that?

07:10.640 --> 07:12.000
I do.

07:15.240 --> 07:18.198
Oh, to think of it.
To be home at last.

07:18.200 --> 07:20.078
With a sense of purpose.

07:20.080 --> 07:21.440
Here, have some.

07:22.440 --> 07:24.118
No, my love. I've no appetite.

07:24.120 --> 07:25.840
-You're wasting away.
-No.

07:30.560 --> 07:31.880
I didn't want it anyway.

07:33.840 --> 07:35.238
I missed you, Papa.

07:35.240 --> 07:36.960
Oh, and I you, my boy.

07:47.040 --> 07:48.440
Come on, then.

08:10.200 --> 08:11.558
Good day, children.

08:11.560 --> 08:13.240
Good day, Mrs Carne.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.400
Won't you come in?

08:21.200 --> 08:22.480
Good day, Hanna.

08:31.560 --> 08:33.758
Tis a fine thing for them
to be learning together

08:33.760 --> 08:35.837
instead of singly,
as Master Geoffrey did.

08:35.840 --> 08:37.320
And John Conan.

08:39.240 --> 08:41.600
Lady Whitworth will not have him
mix with other children.

08:43.080 --> 08:45.120
Better to preserve
the Whitworth rank.

08:48.480 --> 08:51.200
Today, my dears,
we'll be learning about trees.

08:52.760 --> 08:54.758
I'll be an hour or two at most.

08:54.760 --> 08:56.080
You hope.

08:58.040 --> 08:59.998
I called to see how Kitty is.

09:00.000 --> 09:01.838
Not fond of physicians.

09:01.840 --> 09:03.680
-Even friendly ones?
-They especially.

09:11.640 --> 09:12.920
Tess.

09:15.080 --> 09:17.598
My wife has a generous heart

09:17.600 --> 09:20.000
and chooses to see the best
in people.

09:21.360 --> 09:23.240
An admirable quality,
which I do not possess.

09:24.680 --> 09:26.638
So let me advise you,

09:26.640 --> 09:28.438
if you value your tenure here.

09:28.440 --> 09:30.318
Oh, I do, sir.

09:30.320 --> 09:31.958
Give her no cause to regret it,

09:31.960 --> 09:33.520
or you'll answer to me.

09:45.640 --> 09:47.078
You're very kind

09:47.080 --> 09:49.160
but I often suffer
with these little malaises.

09:50.560 --> 09:52.678
I just sit quiet and let them pass.

09:52.680 --> 09:53.960
And do they?

09:56.280 --> 09:57.400
Always.

10:10.880 --> 10:13.318
I had six patients in Sawle,

10:13.320 --> 10:14.758
then I called at Nampara.

10:14.760 --> 10:15.958
Is someone sick?

10:15.960 --> 10:18.198
Kitty. Though she denies it.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.838
To what purpose?

10:19.840 --> 10:21.958
The mistaken belief that
she must be strong?

10:21.960 --> 10:24.238
-She, like anyone, has frailties.
-Oh.

10:24.240 --> 10:26.238
A woman of her intelligence
and spirit

10:26.240 --> 10:28.518
condemned to servitude till Ned
took her as his equal.

10:28.520 --> 10:30.878
And then to be thrust into society,

10:30.880 --> 10:32.678
which is so quick to judge,

10:32.680 --> 10:35.038
so harsh and unforgiving.

10:35.040 --> 10:36.320
I pity her.

10:37.920 --> 10:39.640
Almost as much as you admire her.

10:45.440 --> 10:47.838
She's faced many hurdles
with grace and fortitude.

10:47.840 --> 10:49.438
Who would fail to admire her?

10:49.440 --> 10:50.760
-Thank you.
-Sir.

10:57.240 --> 10:58.680
I must go out again.

11:05.080 --> 11:08.278
Well, Horace, I fear you
and I are too frivolous.

11:08.280 --> 11:10.200
We live a life unencumbered
by struggle...

11:11.280 --> 11:13.120
..and Dr Enys admires struggle.

11:15.760 --> 11:17.280
How can we hope to compete?

11:23.720 --> 11:25.958
Blessed Lord, we pray for the folk

11:25.960 --> 11:28.600
and the livelihoods lately
lost in the mine disaster.

11:30.240 --> 11:32.358
May Wheal Plenty rise again

11:32.360 --> 11:36.718
that it may give us means to build
our school and prosper once more.

11:36.720 --> 11:37.958
Amen.

11:37.960 --> 11:39.200
Amen.

11:46.960 --> 11:48.360
There you go, as promised.

11:52.040 --> 11:54.000
Bless you again
for saving our Billy.

11:55.400 --> 11:57.158
Our rescue heroics aside,

11:57.160 --> 12:00.678
your poor relief won't suffice to
let these people survive.

12:00.680 --> 12:02.638
Warleggans offered to help us yet?

12:02.640 --> 12:04.000
Only a matter of time!

12:06.400 --> 12:08.278
Here, that will keep you warm.

12:08.280 --> 12:09.760
Thank you, sir.

12:12.160 --> 12:14.280
Yes, I will take over
Sir George's case.

12:15.520 --> 12:17.518
On one condition.

12:17.520 --> 12:19.878
I must be given free rein.

12:19.880 --> 12:22.238
But Dr Penrose insisted...

12:22.240 --> 12:24.558
Dr Penrose's methods were primitive
in the extreme.

12:24.560 --> 12:26.798
His aim was to break Sir George.

12:26.800 --> 12:27.960
Mine is to mend him.

12:29.360 --> 12:33.518
And, to that end,
I insist upon no locked doors,

12:33.520 --> 12:36.638
plenty of fresh air, sunlight,
wholesome food...

12:36.640 --> 12:38.118
..and company.

12:38.120 --> 12:41.478
Sir George has taken
refuge in a world of shadows.

12:41.480 --> 12:43.880
He needs to learn that it is safe
to return to this one.

12:46.840 --> 12:50.158
I need hardly remind you,
your absolute discretion is...

12:50.160 --> 12:51.518
Is assured, sir,

12:51.520 --> 12:54.000
by my oath as a physician
and as a gentleman.

12:59.840 --> 13:02.358
The Colonel would say the wealthy
should be held to account.

13:02.360 --> 13:05.200
The Colonel can be over-hasty.
I will do what I can for you.

13:07.240 --> 13:08.800
Thank you very much, Mr Stevens.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.440
-It's the price of grain.
-I've made a note.

13:34.480 --> 13:37.040
-Sam and Rosina?
-Do we like the notion?

13:38.200 --> 13:40.438
I like any addition to the family.

13:40.440 --> 13:42.200
He's the only one
you're like to get.

13:44.760 --> 13:46.600
Morwenna keeps her distance still?

13:47.680 --> 13:50.438
Sometimes I think she's afeared.

13:50.440 --> 13:52.240
Not of love itself.

13:54.120 --> 13:55.198
The consequence.

13:55.200 --> 13:56.918
A child?

13:56.920 --> 13:58.558
Even one born of violation.

13:58.560 --> 14:01.718
Can a mother truly forget
a son she birthed?

14:01.720 --> 14:03.760
She had no choice
but to give up John Conan.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.198
The head might say so...

14:07.200 --> 14:08.440
..but the heart?

14:53.520 --> 14:55.800
Mr Ralph Hanson
and Miss Cecily Hanson.

15:16.240 --> 15:19.360
What an unexpected
pleasure to see you both.

15:21.400 --> 15:25.718
My nephew is much taken up
with matters of business.

15:25.720 --> 15:28.918
So, erm, forgive him if he seems...

15:28.920 --> 15:30.360
..a thought distracted.

15:31.320 --> 15:34.520
Well, I'm most keen to conclude our
venture ahead of any competition.

15:37.760 --> 15:40.960
I never knew a man to be
so absorbed in business matters.

15:41.960 --> 15:43.640
Well, not necessarily a fault.

15:45.120 --> 15:47.320
How long ago did
Sir George lose his wife?

15:49.480 --> 15:50.758
A year.

15:50.760 --> 15:52.598
He must feel the loss keenly.

15:52.600 --> 15:54.078
Yes...

15:54.080 --> 15:56.318
..and no.

15:56.320 --> 15:57.838
His, erm,

15:57.840 --> 16:01.038
finer feelings mourn her passing,

16:01.040 --> 16:03.240
but now he looks to the future.

16:04.400 --> 16:05.718
And a new wife.

16:05.720 --> 16:07.480
Oh! I'm happy for him.

16:09.640 --> 16:11.120
Do you know the lady?

16:12.720 --> 16:13.960
Yes, I do.

16:35.600 --> 16:38.478
Oh, well done!
That's 32 now, isn't it?

16:38.480 --> 16:39.760
Can you throw it back?

16:48.280 --> 16:49.920
Oh, no! Go, go.

17:02.840 --> 17:05.358
Nay, but do folk
hereabouts not despair

17:05.359 --> 17:08.117
that the day will never come
when justice serves the commons

17:08.119 --> 17:09.478
as well as the rich?

17:09.480 --> 17:12.998
Injustice is not restricted
to the poor, believe me.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.518
But, yes, they feel it more keenly
and should be championed.

17:15.520 --> 17:17.438
In words or deeds?

17:17.440 --> 17:19.358
For can change ever come
through words alone?

17:19.359 --> 17:20.798
If there are ears to hear.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.678
But, otherwise, deeds?

17:22.680 --> 17:24.718
And sometimes violent ones.

17:24.720 --> 17:27.678
That should only be
as a last resort, but...

17:27.680 --> 17:29.398
..sometimes it is a necessary evil.

17:29.400 --> 17:30.520
Ned.

17:31.960 --> 17:33.758
A moment.

17:33.760 --> 17:34.960
Excuse me.

17:37.320 --> 17:38.878
Have a care.

17:38.880 --> 17:40.080
You may be taken at your word.

17:41.800 --> 17:43.638
Have you forgot where we are?

17:43.640 --> 17:45.918
This is not London.

17:45.920 --> 17:47.798
Do you suppose there are spies here?

17:47.800 --> 17:50.278
I think it's wise to assume
they're everywhere.

17:50.280 --> 17:51.440
Let's be gone.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.838
I'd see us go the way of the French.

17:57.840 --> 18:01.678
The commons arise and bring
the betters down!

18:01.680 --> 18:03.278
Reckon I best be getting back

18:03.280 --> 18:06.160
to Mistress hoity-toity,
high and mighty Poldark.

18:08.240 --> 18:11.038
Don't you be giving me
the squinny eye, mister!

18:11.040 --> 18:13.478
Are you acquainted with
the Poldarks and Despards?

18:13.480 --> 18:14.720
What if I am?

18:17.680 --> 18:19.680
Would you like a glass of port?

18:28.160 --> 18:32.198
So, Ned Despard must be
the new Messiah

18:32.200 --> 18:33.998
after the mine rescue.

18:34.000 --> 18:37.278
All the rags and tatters
flock to him.

18:37.280 --> 18:41.078
Hold him in as high regard as
they hold Warleggans in contempt.

18:41.080 --> 18:43.240
But the people
will surely rise soon.

18:44.240 --> 18:45.760
I may have a task for you.

18:55.360 --> 18:57.758
Well...

18:57.760 --> 19:00.878
..I thought you'd like to know that
my father's chosen me a husband!

19:00.880 --> 19:02.598
Excellent.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.198
Who is the fortunate soul?

19:04.200 --> 19:06.798
-I believe you're acquainted.
-Name of?

19:06.800 --> 19:08.400
Warleggan, George.

19:10.800 --> 19:12.118
Excellent jest!

19:12.120 --> 19:13.520
Why, is he a comical man?

19:24.840 --> 19:27.198
You cannot mean it.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.320
You cannot.

19:29.560 --> 19:31.558
He will not love you.

19:31.560 --> 19:32.918
LOVE me?

19:32.920 --> 19:35.198
What has love to do with anything?

19:35.200 --> 19:36.800
It has everything to do...

19:37.880 --> 19:40.878
Surely you must see -
you cannot marry him!

19:40.880 --> 19:42.278
Who must I marry, then?

19:42.280 --> 19:44.078
Me! Marry me!

19:44.080 --> 19:45.680
I love you! I...

19:48.800 --> 19:50.320
I-I love you.

19:52.520 --> 19:54.040
Why would you say that?

19:55.840 --> 19:57.560
Why would you ruin our friendship?

20:11.000 --> 20:12.558
Halt!

20:12.560 --> 20:15.318
Who goes there? Friend or foe?

20:15.320 --> 20:17.318
Erm, friend!

20:17.320 --> 20:19.800
Advance, friend, and be recognised!

20:23.560 --> 20:25.080
-You out here alone?
-Yes.

20:26.280 --> 20:28.318
What would your father say
if he were home?

20:28.320 --> 20:29.600
He IS home.

20:40.640 --> 20:43.078
Ask George to sell you Wheal Plenty.

20:43.080 --> 20:44.678
He'll likely refuse,

20:44.680 --> 20:46.280
but at least I can try.

20:47.560 --> 20:50.958
And what of your complainants -
what do they seek?

20:50.960 --> 20:53.638
Work, means,

20:53.640 --> 20:54.960
justice, hope.

20:57.640 --> 21:00.838
What struck me afresh
was just how ill-equipped

21:00.840 --> 21:03.918
they are to deal with such blows.

21:03.920 --> 21:05.758
Unskilled, uneducated.

21:05.760 --> 21:09.840
Our school could remedy that, were
it not so small and served so few.

21:11.240 --> 21:12.800
Ned agrees with me.

21:14.280 --> 21:15.358
Where is he?

21:15.360 --> 21:16.798
Oh, he's gone straight to bed.

21:16.800 --> 21:19.598
He was, erm, somewhat tipsy!

21:19.600 --> 21:22.478
And somewhat free
with his tongue today.

21:22.480 --> 21:25.958
Truro is not London, and no-one here
will report him, but...

21:25.960 --> 21:27.518
He should be on his guard.

21:27.520 --> 21:28.760
As I've told him.

21:30.800 --> 21:31.960
Do you think he listened?

21:33.800 --> 21:35.560
If he's anything like you.

21:38.440 --> 21:39.800
Apple pie.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.638
Has the mystery sufferer
summoned you again?

21:49.640 --> 21:52.040
My love, you know
I cannot discuss my patients.

22:09.720 --> 22:11.758
Ross! What brings you here?

22:11.760 --> 22:13.598
I've come to make George an offer.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.278
I'd say now is not the time.

22:15.280 --> 22:16.520
Is he unwell?

22:27.360 --> 22:28.758
Doctor.

22:28.760 --> 22:30.360
We shall be out for the morning.

22:33.280 --> 22:35.480
-Poldark.
-I came to see Sir George.

22:36.560 --> 22:38.278
To what purpose?

22:38.280 --> 22:39.720
To make an offer for Plenty.

22:40.960 --> 22:43.038
You couldn't afford it.

22:43.040 --> 22:44.240
Name your price.

23:20.760 --> 23:22.360
You were her first love.

23:23.600 --> 23:24.680
And she mine.

23:25.600 --> 23:27.958
But life had other plans for us.

23:27.960 --> 23:31.078
I joined the army.
And she, thinking me dead...

23:31.080 --> 23:32.440
Married my father.

23:35.240 --> 23:36.480
Was it the right choice?

23:37.560 --> 23:39.120
It produced you, did it not?

23:40.480 --> 23:42.318
But for you?

23:42.320 --> 23:43.480
Yes.

23:44.800 --> 23:47.120
Because it left me
with a different choice.

23:48.360 --> 23:49.840
And that choice saved me.

23:53.400 --> 23:54.640
Cecily is to wed.

23:58.280 --> 23:59.760
Does that distress you?

24:01.560 --> 24:02.640
On two counts.

24:04.040 --> 24:08.198
One, because I realise,
to my cost, that I...

24:08.200 --> 24:09.280
Love her?

24:10.480 --> 24:11.520
Yes.

24:12.680 --> 24:15.238
And two, because her...

24:15.240 --> 24:16.320
..intended...

24:18.200 --> 24:19.400
Her intended...

24:21.120 --> 24:23.998
Dear God, the twisted quirk of fate
that gives the girl I love

24:24.000 --> 24:26.278
to the man I loathe!

24:26.280 --> 24:27.400
George?

24:31.560 --> 24:33.640
Is that why Hanson's been
lurking in Cornwall?

24:35.440 --> 24:37.840
I'd certainly wouldn't wish him
as a father-in-law.

24:39.800 --> 24:42.038
But the engagement is certain?

24:42.040 --> 24:44.518
And equally certain are her
feelings for me.

24:44.520 --> 24:45.880
I am her friend. Nothing more.

24:49.880 --> 24:51.520
No doubt you think me a baby.

24:54.800 --> 24:55.920
First love.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.360
It may not be a lasting love...

24:59.960 --> 25:02.160
..but nothing will ever cut quite
so deeply again.

25:32.120 --> 25:33.480
A little further.

25:37.560 --> 25:38.680
Take my arm.

25:40.560 --> 25:42.878
This will not be easy,

25:42.880 --> 25:44.480
but it is a necessity.

25:57.760 --> 25:59.838
But I...

25:59.840 --> 26:02.480
But I saw her only yesterday.

26:04.160 --> 26:05.520
In your memory.

26:07.040 --> 26:09.038
And memory should be cherished,

26:09.040 --> 26:11.598
but not mistaken for what is real...

26:11.600 --> 26:13.120
..however painful that may be.

26:15.840 --> 26:17.878
Pain...

26:17.880 --> 26:19.000
..is powerful...

26:20.440 --> 26:22.518
..but needful.
It reminds us that we are alive.

26:22.520 --> 26:24.518
We cannot avoid it.
Nor should we try.

26:24.520 --> 26:27.038
But she...
She could have avoided it.

26:27.040 --> 26:28.600
She need not have left me.

26:29.600 --> 26:31.440
I could have forgiven her
anything but that.

26:32.520 --> 26:34.518
What was there to forgive?

26:34.520 --> 26:36.958
The child. The child!

26:36.960 --> 26:38.878
She need not have had it.

26:38.880 --> 26:41.278
I...I wanted it, of course,

26:41.280 --> 26:43.360
but I would have loved her
regardless.

26:45.280 --> 26:47.118
But she was...

26:47.120 --> 26:48.320
..determined.

26:49.920 --> 26:51.038
And the child killed her.

26:51.040 --> 26:52.680
The child is guiltless.

26:54.880 --> 26:56.798
There is no fault in any of this.

26:56.800 --> 26:58.360
Loss, yes...

27:00.400 --> 27:01.720
..but no blame.

28:14.760 --> 28:15.920
Good day, John.

28:18.240 --> 28:19.680
Do you remember me?

28:25.200 --> 28:27.200
Are you a friend of grandmama?

28:30.280 --> 28:31.440
No.

28:32.840 --> 28:34.520
But I could be a friend of yours.

28:37.320 --> 28:39.840
John Conan, where are you?

29:21.480 --> 29:23.638
What is your view, Horace?

29:23.640 --> 29:27.918
Should husbands and wives have
secrets from each other?

29:27.920 --> 29:31.318
Horace knows there are many reasons
why spouses keep secrets.

29:31.320 --> 29:33.600
If one is a physician,
for instance.

29:35.040 --> 29:37.238
Or had cause to protect the other.

29:37.240 --> 29:39.320
But when does protection
become deception?

29:42.920 --> 29:46.440
But perhaps Dr Enys thinks deception
is the better part of valour.

29:50.720 --> 29:52.040
Perhaps he does.

29:56.760 --> 29:58.160
Thank you.

29:59.840 --> 30:02.798
Folks be saying that in the
West Indies there be no distinction

30:02.800 --> 30:05.120
betwixt masters and servants.

30:06.680 --> 30:08.398
I wish that was true!

30:08.400 --> 30:12.798
What is true is that, when I was
governor, we all laboured together.

30:12.800 --> 30:18.318
Gentry and commons, freed slaves
and convicts, outlaws and rebels.

30:18.320 --> 30:19.958
It can be done.

30:19.960 --> 30:21.438
It can be done.

30:21.440 --> 30:22.598
I believe thee.

30:22.600 --> 30:25.198
Perhaps Warleggan
needs to learn that lesson.

30:35.200 --> 30:36.480
Will you forgive me?

30:57.120 --> 30:58.878
Kitty, this sickness...

30:58.880 --> 31:00.598
Oh, most vexing.

31:00.600 --> 31:02.038
But the cause...

31:02.040 --> 31:04.520
Oh, it's my husband. Blame Ned!

31:06.800 --> 31:08.880
Here, he grows restless.

31:10.240 --> 31:12.518
And you grow more stubborn.

31:12.520 --> 31:14.560
Must I take matters
into my own hands?

31:16.480 --> 31:18.398
What is it you fear?

31:18.400 --> 31:19.600
I cannot say.

31:25.360 --> 31:26.600
You must say.

31:29.120 --> 31:30.600
Is it really so terrible?

31:33.080 --> 31:34.680
The thought of a child?

31:40.560 --> 31:41.960
No...

31:45.800 --> 31:47.958
..but the loss is.

31:47.960 --> 31:50.200
I've had more miscarriages
than I can count.

31:51.240 --> 31:54.600
I cannot bear the thought of raising
Ned's hopes again and dashing them.

31:56.720 --> 31:58.718
I beg you, please don't tell him.

31:58.720 --> 32:00.158
This one might survive.

32:00.160 --> 32:01.560
It will not.

32:03.600 --> 32:04.880
I know it.

32:11.920 --> 32:14.398
I've been thinking of poor
Geoffrey Charles.

32:14.400 --> 32:17.358
Poor Cecily!
Would you wish George on anyone?

32:17.360 --> 32:19.718
But if he has a mind to wed,

32:19.720 --> 32:22.118
maybe he'll have a mind
to reopen Plenty.

32:22.120 --> 32:24.120
Owing to a surge of high spirits
and generosity?

32:27.040 --> 32:28.480
There is another option.

32:39.800 --> 32:40.958
How much?

32:40.960 --> 32:43.158
The price is somewhat inflated.

32:43.160 --> 32:45.758
Somewhat? It's twice the value!

32:45.760 --> 32:47.160
Here is a list of my assets.

32:51.080 --> 32:53.278
Wildly insufficient.

32:53.280 --> 32:57.238
And even if they weren't,
to venture all on such a purchase?

32:57.240 --> 33:00.558
You have everything to lose -
and what would you gain?

33:00.560 --> 33:03.878
-A working mine.
-You already have one!

33:03.880 --> 33:06.838
Oh, I'm well aware of your motives,

33:06.840 --> 33:08.918
and don't think
I don't applaud them.

33:08.920 --> 33:10.118
But as your friend...

33:10.120 --> 33:13.718
It's as partner in the Cornish Bank
that I appeal to you.

33:13.720 --> 33:15.680
Would it be willing to
underwrite the purchase?

33:17.160 --> 33:19.478
That could present
a conflict of interest,

33:19.480 --> 33:21.598
given that you
yourself are a partner!

33:21.600 --> 33:23.758
Would the Warleggans
have such qualms?

33:23.760 --> 33:26.798
Warleggans bring
capital to the table.

33:26.800 --> 33:28.878
You bring only your name.

33:28.880 --> 33:31.598
On the strength of that name,

33:31.600 --> 33:33.000
how much might I raise?

33:36.840 --> 33:38.838
Are you quite certain...

33:38.840 --> 33:40.240
..she died?

33:42.360 --> 33:43.760
I was there.

33:49.200 --> 33:51.318
Was I?

33:51.320 --> 33:52.600
You don't recall?

34:02.480 --> 34:03.720
Yes.

34:08.440 --> 34:09.600
Yes, I-I...

34:11.480 --> 34:13.040
I-I held her hand.

34:14.440 --> 34:15.920
-Did I not?
-Yes.

34:19.719 --> 34:21.438
And she told me she was...

34:21.440 --> 34:23.678
..afraid of the dark.

34:23.679 --> 34:25.078
She did.

34:25.080 --> 34:28.920
And then her eyes fixed
on something beyond my shoulder...

34:31.239 --> 34:32.639
..and her breathing stilled.

34:35.840 --> 34:37.118
And I...

34:37.120 --> 34:40.239
I felt the life go out of her.

34:43.239 --> 34:46.239
And I wondered, where had she gone?

34:47.760 --> 34:49.159
My living...

34:50.280 --> 34:51.719
..breathing...

34:53.040 --> 34:54.600
..beautiful wife.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.638
But you were there.

34:58.640 --> 35:00.960
The last face she ever saw
was yours.

35:03.400 --> 35:05.518
Yes.

35:05.520 --> 35:06.960
Mine.

36:03.280 --> 36:04.600
My uncle tells me...

36:06.720 --> 36:07.920
..I should remarry.

36:09.640 --> 36:11.238
If that is what you desire.

36:11.240 --> 36:12.720
I have no desire.

36:15.240 --> 36:17.998
I do not believe
I will feel desire ever again.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.718
-So, this marriage?
-Is a business transaction.

36:20.720 --> 36:23.678
And the lady in question?

36:23.680 --> 36:25.480
Must make the best of it.

36:40.360 --> 36:41.838
Miss Hanson.

36:41.840 --> 36:43.160
Mistress Poldark.

36:45.680 --> 36:47.200
Geoffrey Charles is not here.

36:48.600 --> 36:50.358
I thank you, ma'am.

36:50.360 --> 36:52.518
It's you I seek...

36:52.520 --> 36:53.998
..and your opinion.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.478
Mine?

36:55.480 --> 36:59.320
May I ask,
what kind of a man is Sir George?

37:04.960 --> 37:06.160
He's wealthy...

37:07.960 --> 37:09.240
..and he's powerful.

37:11.360 --> 37:13.240
When he wishes,
he can be most generous.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.600
I believe his late wife
wanted for nothing.

37:19.760 --> 37:22.238
And his children?

37:22.240 --> 37:23.518
Are they amiable?

37:23.520 --> 37:25.318
Do they favour him?

37:25.320 --> 37:26.960
The son - not so much.

37:31.520 --> 37:33.240
When is the wedding to be?

37:34.920 --> 37:36.040
Does it matter?

37:38.440 --> 37:42.038
A cage is a cage,
whether now or in ten years.

37:42.040 --> 37:44.198
Unless one weds for love.

37:44.200 --> 37:45.520
Did you?

37:46.880 --> 37:48.078
Yes.

37:48.080 --> 37:50.000
And how long before you
realised your mistake?

37:54.160 --> 37:57.678
My mistakes have been
many and spectacular,

37:57.680 --> 38:00.160
and doubtless there's more to come.

38:02.080 --> 38:04.120
But the wisest thing I ever did...

38:05.800 --> 38:07.480
..was to marry the man I love.

38:14.840 --> 38:16.360
I thank you, ma'am.

38:30.600 --> 38:33.078
So, how goes it with Despard?

38:33.080 --> 38:35.158
Well, he's a regular firebrand.

38:35.160 --> 38:37.118
Quick temper, loose tongue.

38:37.120 --> 38:40.878
Be easy enough to set him off
and the townsfolk will follow.

38:40.880 --> 38:42.118
And these will assist you?

38:42.120 --> 38:43.918
If you make it worth their while.

38:43.920 --> 38:45.238
Excellent.

38:45.240 --> 38:47.238
And, as discussed, something

38:47.240 --> 38:50.200
to send Sir George scurrying back to
London.

38:53.400 --> 38:56.318
Are you quite certain your wife
will see the merit?

38:56.320 --> 38:58.438
The cost will make her eyes water -

38:58.440 --> 39:00.478
and she'll wish there were other
ways to fund it.

39:00.480 --> 39:01.798
I share her wish.

39:01.800 --> 39:04.158
To mortgage your entire estate -

39:04.160 --> 39:07.078
house, land, farm, livestock -

39:07.080 --> 39:09.838
what sensible man would even
consider it?

39:09.840 --> 39:12.278
Wheal Plenty is a profitable mine!

39:12.280 --> 39:13.438
It's worth the risk.

39:13.440 --> 39:14.760
Is your marriage?

39:19.320 --> 39:21.000
I'm obliged to you, as ever, Harris.

39:22.160 --> 39:23.360
Folly!

39:25.080 --> 39:26.800
Absolute madness!

39:32.360 --> 39:34.518
Cornwall must hold
some vast attraction

39:34.520 --> 39:36.198
to keep you so long from London.

39:36.200 --> 39:37.798
My daughter is shortly to be wed.

39:37.800 --> 39:39.878
Ensuring her future is
what keeps me here.

39:39.880 --> 39:42.118
Oh. And not her happiness?

39:42.120 --> 39:45.078
If that's your aim, I humbly
recommend you look elsewhere.

39:45.080 --> 39:47.278
Marriage to Sir George would
ensure the opposite.

39:47.280 --> 39:48.600
Good day.

39:56.680 --> 39:58.080
Do you, indeed?

40:10.680 --> 40:11.760
Valentine?

40:13.040 --> 40:14.598
Where's your nurse?

40:14.600 --> 40:15.800
Trenwith.

40:16.960 --> 40:18.558
Where are you going?

40:18.560 --> 40:19.678
To Nampara.

40:19.680 --> 40:21.758
You told me to visit
whenever I liked.

40:21.760 --> 40:23.638
Oh.

40:23.640 --> 40:25.840
If your papa is home,
he might not like it.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.438
Will you ride with me?

40:30.440 --> 40:31.598
May I?

40:31.600 --> 40:32.800
Of course.

40:34.800 --> 40:36.478
But not to Nampara.

40:36.480 --> 40:37.918
There's a place

40:37.920 --> 40:41.480
where I think you'll enjoy more.

40:52.920 --> 40:54.158
Where's Tess?

40:54.160 --> 40:55.918
Gone Truro.

40:55.920 --> 40:57.158
Said she had errands to run.

40:57.160 --> 40:58.958
-Did you send her?
-Nay, maid.

40:58.960 --> 41:00.760
She have a will of her own,
that one.

41:02.800 --> 41:06.118
-Wheal Plenty paid the worst of wages.
-Yes.

41:06.120 --> 41:10.198
But, but, but they who laboured
least had means to eat.

41:10.200 --> 41:12.398
Now, how do they survive?

41:12.400 --> 41:16.118
-Gentry care naught if commons starve.
-No.

41:16.120 --> 41:18.598
But here's one who do
have a conscience,

41:18.600 --> 41:21.600
who we thank for bringing
young Arthur Hoblyn out alive.

41:23.080 --> 41:26.558
And it sticks in the craw
to save 14 lives,

41:26.560 --> 41:29.758
only to see another 200 wrecked
by the closing of the mine.

41:29.760 --> 41:30.958
Yes!

41:30.960 --> 41:32.478
Tell that to the Warleggans!

41:32.480 --> 41:34.398
Yes!

41:34.400 --> 41:37.798
Nay, I mean it.
Make known our complaint.

41:37.800 --> 41:41.078
For if we suffer in silence,
will it not seem we consent?

41:41.080 --> 41:43.680
We march tomorrow.
Will ye not go with us?

41:45.480 --> 41:48.238
-Peaceably now!
-We want no trouble, sir.

41:48.240 --> 41:49.920
Just our grievances heard.

41:58.400 --> 42:00.440
-That's mine!
-Give her it back.

42:02.840 --> 42:04.278
Mistress.

42:07.080 --> 42:09.160
There now. Come with me.

42:10.200 --> 42:12.200
Tis nothing. He meant no harm.

42:14.680 --> 42:16.038
Oh!

42:16.040 --> 42:17.920
Is the new pupil ready
to return home?

42:20.160 --> 42:21.720
-Shall we be off, sir?
-Yes.

42:22.840 --> 42:24.838
I'll explain later.

42:24.840 --> 42:26.240
Good boy.

42:47.360 --> 42:50.120
Why can that man not leave us be?!

42:53.960 --> 42:55.438
What man?

42:55.440 --> 42:58.160
Ross Poldark is determined
to steal my son!

43:03.080 --> 43:04.240
Get Enys.

43:10.040 --> 43:11.558
He will have him.

43:11.560 --> 43:14.318
He has tried to take him
as he tried to take Elizabeth.

43:14.320 --> 43:16.998
But Valentine is mine,
whatever that old hag said.

43:17.000 --> 43:19.038
Valentine is yours, yes.

43:19.040 --> 43:21.598
I delivered him myself and, as I
told you at the time,

43:21.600 --> 43:25.038
there was nothing whatsoever to
support Miss Poldark's claim.

43:25.040 --> 43:28.718
And that must be a comfort to you
because, although your wife is gone,

43:28.720 --> 43:32.158
she is with you in the faces
of your children.

43:32.160 --> 43:33.318
My children.

43:33.320 --> 43:36.238
In whom you are doubly blessed,
for they are still with you,

43:36.240 --> 43:38.360
when to other parents
fate has been more cruel.

43:41.600 --> 43:42.960
Yes, yes.

43:44.800 --> 43:46.320
I still have my children.

43:48.680 --> 43:50.920
My Ursula. My Valentine.

43:56.760 --> 43:58.998
I found him on his way to Nampara.

43:59.000 --> 44:02.478
I brought him to the school
because I did not wish him...

44:02.480 --> 44:04.480
..to regard our home as his.

44:07.760 --> 44:09.398
Should I forbid it?

44:09.400 --> 44:10.560
I could.

44:12.920 --> 44:14.400
And it sit not easy with you.

44:16.000 --> 44:17.358
No.

44:17.360 --> 44:20.440
Because you think yourself, what,
in some way responsible?

44:21.440 --> 44:22.840
Not for him, but...

44:24.360 --> 44:25.880
..for what happened to Elizabeth.

44:27.640 --> 44:31.678
It was I who suggested
she had another child.

44:31.680 --> 44:35.398
George could not quell his doubts
about Valentine.

44:35.400 --> 44:37.478
But how could he doubt
a second child?

44:37.480 --> 44:41.678
If anything, I thought it would make
him more secure in his marriage.

44:41.680 --> 44:43.718
So she had another child.

44:43.720 --> 44:45.520
And she died delivering it.

44:46.760 --> 44:48.080
So I hold myself...

44:50.760 --> 44:52.160
..indirectly responsible.

44:56.880 --> 44:58.160
No, Ross...

45:01.280 --> 45:02.480
..you're not to blame.

45:07.360 --> 45:08.800
How could you be?

45:19.320 --> 45:22.238
I hope your wife will
still be your wife

45:22.240 --> 45:25.480
when she knows what you've done.

45:27.920 --> 45:30.638
-Come and get your apples here.
-Thank you.

45:30.640 --> 45:34.558
Erm, I'll take four pears, please.

45:34.560 --> 45:37.918
# Ah! Ca ira, ca ira, ca ira... #

45:37.920 --> 45:40.238
Tess, what are you doing here?

45:40.240 --> 45:41.958
My duty, mistress!

45:41.960 --> 45:45.998
As a comrade o' th' down-be-trod,
I mus' stand beside 'em!

45:46.000 --> 45:48.038
# Ah! Ca ira, ca ira, ca ira... #

45:48.040 --> 45:50.558
Ned, do Ross know you're here?

45:50.560 --> 45:52.918
This is a peaceable protest,
Demelza.

45:52.920 --> 45:55.400
There is nothing to concern
him, or you.

45:59.800 --> 46:02.078
This is a peaceful protest.

46:02.080 --> 46:03.758
Till it get t' Warleggans!

46:03.760 --> 46:05.158
The bank or the mine?

46:05.160 --> 46:06.760
His fancy house.

46:08.600 --> 46:10.718
-Caroline, you must ride home.
-Of course.

46:10.720 --> 46:13.440
Stay for nothin' or no-one.
And keep indoors.

46:22.080 --> 46:24.158
# Ah! Ca ira, ca ira, ca ira

46:24.160 --> 46:26.758
# Le peuple en
ce jour sans cesse repete

46:26.760 --> 46:29.200
# Ah! Ca ira, ca ira, ca ira... #

46:31.720 --> 46:34.998
A woman's touch is what
this house lacks.

46:35.000 --> 46:39.838
And Valentine will
benefit from female influence.

46:39.840 --> 46:43.480
The girl's father is most keen
to bring matters to a head.

46:45.520 --> 46:47.000
Have you a day in mind?

46:48.920 --> 46:51.120
# Ah! Ca ira, ca ira, ca ira

46:54.160 --> 46:56.798
# Ah! Ca ira, ca ira, ca ira

46:56.800 --> 46:59.278
# Le peuple en ce jour sans
cesse repete

46:59.280 --> 47:01.438
# Ah! Ca ira, ca ira, ca ira

47:01.440 --> 47:04.478
# Le peuple en ce jour sans
cesse repete

47:04.480 --> 47:06.638
# Ah! Ca ira, ca ira, ca ira

47:06.640 --> 47:10.598
# Le peuple en ce jour sans
cesse repete... #

47:10.600 --> 47:12.200
Bessie? Take Valentine upstairs.

47:14.840 --> 47:16.998
There he is! Spineless worm!

47:17.000 --> 47:20.078
Let 'im come out an' answer to us!
If he dare!

47:26.160 --> 47:28.040
George Warleggan!

47:31.240 --> 47:33.438
What do they want?
Call the constables.

47:33.440 --> 47:35.560
Let him come out
and speak to his workers!

47:41.160 --> 47:42.720
Is he mad?

47:45.120 --> 47:46.278
Ross!

47:46.280 --> 47:47.718
Ross, wait.

47:47.720 --> 47:50.318
-Demelza.
-We must go to Trenwith.

47:50.320 --> 47:51.640
What is it?

47:53.360 --> 47:55.520
George Warleggan!

48:03.680 --> 48:06.838
Break th' door down! Go on!

48:06.840 --> 48:10.200
-Go on!
-Go on!
-Break it down!

48:13.720 --> 48:15.360
Tear th' 'ouse down!

48:23.080 --> 48:26.278
Sir George is not receiving
visitors.

48:26.280 --> 48:29.440
Well, Sir George has 'em,
whether he likes it or not.

48:39.600 --> 48:43.398
The very least these people
deserve is an apology.

48:43.400 --> 48:45.238
It's not my business to apologise.

48:45.240 --> 48:47.558
Leave my house
before I have you shot.

48:47.560 --> 48:51.678
No, sir, no, no, no,
that won't do at all.

48:51.680 --> 48:54.558
If you decline to come down and
speak civilly with these people,

48:54.560 --> 48:56.200
I'll come up there and fetch you.

49:02.040 --> 49:03.600
Let him deal with it.

49:13.280 --> 49:18.038
Sir George,
have you ever been unfairly treated?

49:18.040 --> 49:20.918
Can you comprehend what it is to
have no recourse or reparation,

49:20.920 --> 49:22.478
or even a fair hearing?

49:22.480 --> 49:24.440
Get out of my way.

49:26.280 --> 49:28.118
These people are not savages.

49:28.120 --> 49:30.920
All they ask is common decency.

49:32.240 --> 49:33.518
How do you answer?

49:33.520 --> 49:34.718
With this.

49:41.480 --> 49:42.878
Demelza, through here.

49:42.880 --> 49:44.118
My arm. My arm is broken!

49:44.120 --> 49:46.318
Ross, I told you this was
like to happen.

49:46.320 --> 49:48.198
For your own sake,
keep order out there, Ned.

49:48.200 --> 49:49.440
Demelza, help me.

49:54.480 --> 49:58.398
That man - he has stirred up the mob
- he has set them on a rampage.

49:58.400 --> 50:00.598
And what did you expect
when you closed a working mine?

50:00.600 --> 50:03.038
That folk'd celebrate,
that your name would be praised?

50:03.040 --> 50:05.358
-Do you seriously think I care?
-I think you do, George.

50:05.360 --> 50:09.000
As do I, which is why
I offer you a suggestion.

50:10.440 --> 50:12.958
Put those weapons down,
this is a peaceable protest.

50:12.960 --> 50:14.280
Come on!

50:15.680 --> 50:20.920
Friends. Friends, your anger
is wholly justified.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.360
But we have misunderstood
the situation.

50:25.400 --> 50:27.998
Sir George has explained it to me -

50:28.000 --> 50:31.200
and now begs leave
to explain it to you.

50:41.320 --> 50:44.318
Gentlemen, erm,

50:44.320 --> 50:47.478
I have been away in the north.

50:47.480 --> 50:53.600
And on my return discovered that my
orders were incorrectly carried out.

50:55.080 --> 50:58.080
The closure of Wheal Plenty
is temporary.

50:59.720 --> 51:02.918
This week, my mine captain
will assess the damage

51:02.920 --> 51:05.118
caused by the rock fall.

51:05.120 --> 51:07.878
All workers will be reinstated.

51:07.880 --> 51:12.958
And in addition, we will take on
more men in order to expedite

51:12.960 --> 51:15.200
a swift resumption of business.

51:17.200 --> 51:18.720
Do he expect us t' believe 'im?

51:20.240 --> 51:22.638
Should we not still hold
'im t' account?

51:27.160 --> 51:28.400
Right, let's get him!

51:30.520 --> 51:31.918
Whoa.

51:31.920 --> 51:33.440
This could take someone's eye out.

51:36.320 --> 51:37.878
Back off.

51:37.880 --> 51:40.478
Come on, people, back to your homes.

51:40.480 --> 51:42.200
You have what you came for.

52:02.120 --> 52:05.798
Your coming here was blatantly
provocative.

52:05.800 --> 52:08.118
I'm sorry you think so.

52:08.120 --> 52:12.998
You may thank the Lord I managed to
diffuse the situation so ably.

52:13.000 --> 52:14.998
Indeed, George.

52:15.000 --> 52:16.400
I salute you.

52:17.600 --> 52:19.160
Kindly leave my house.

52:22.200 --> 52:24.080
With pleasure.

52:35.760 --> 52:39.478
A fine thought - to let him
think 'twas his idea!

52:39.480 --> 52:42.158
It seemed the most elegant solution.

52:42.160 --> 52:44.358
And it saved us our estate.

52:44.360 --> 52:46.080
Ross.

52:47.160 --> 52:50.200
What you did -
what you were about to do...

52:51.280 --> 52:54.758
Understand, I love you
with all my heart.

52:54.760 --> 52:58.478
And I love your heart and your will
to make this world a better place.

52:58.480 --> 53:03.678
But...sometimes it'd seem
you overlook the cost.

53:03.680 --> 53:07.638
To we, as a family.
To we, as husband an' wife.

53:07.640 --> 53:10.758
Of course, I'd stand by you -
and even go without,

53:10.760 --> 53:12.638
for the sake o' the greater good.

53:12.640 --> 53:15.280
But...sometimes...

53:17.200 --> 53:19.878
..I feel that you
take that for granted.

53:19.880 --> 53:21.280
And I find that hard.

53:25.760 --> 53:27.958
You're too good for me.

53:27.960 --> 53:29.600
-No, Ross...
-I mean it.

53:31.480 --> 53:34.760
When I dragged you
from that dog-fight...

53:36.480 --> 53:39.238
..could I have known that you'd be

53:39.240 --> 53:41.360
the saving grace of my life?

53:51.760 --> 53:53.478
Here, race you back to Nampara?

53:53.480 --> 53:55.760
No contest!

54:07.800 --> 54:10.318
Did you come here to torment me?

54:10.320 --> 54:13.320
No. To complain.

54:14.920 --> 54:19.078
How monstrous,
inconvenient it is to discover

54:19.080 --> 54:22.280
so late in the day
that my heart is engaged.

54:24.000 --> 54:27.080
And not to the eminently
suitable Sir George.

54:28.920 --> 54:33.680
My father will never consent,
so I suppose we must elope.

54:36.120 --> 54:38.760
What? Who, you?

54:42.800 --> 54:45.000
And I?

54:50.920 --> 54:53.400
Could you bear it?

54:54.800 --> 54:56.998
Yes!

54:57.000 --> 54:58.680
Yes, I think I could bear it!

55:15.400 --> 55:18.558
Wheal Plenty open?
Who'd 'a b'lieved it?

55:18.560 --> 55:20.838
An' the real miracle is,
folk be that grateful

55:20.840 --> 55:23.118
they say they'll make donation to
the school.

55:23.120 --> 55:24.758
Maybe I need to
better my readin',

55:24.760 --> 55:27.118
since it seems th' school
shall 'ave need o' me.

55:27.120 --> 55:29.918
So...will 'ee teach me?

55:29.920 --> 55:31.320
Gladly.

55:39.000 --> 55:40.440
Everyone's happy.

56:02.280 --> 56:04.520
Oh, mistress, din' see 'ee there!

56:09.360 --> 56:11.720
I am your mistress no longer, Tess.

56:13.360 --> 56:15.958
Did you think you could remain
after what happened today?

56:15.960 --> 56:17.958
Ee be sendin' me away?

56:17.960 --> 56:22.358
What saddens me is that everyone
told me you mustn't be trusted.

56:22.360 --> 56:25.118
But I wanted to prove 'em wrong.

56:25.120 --> 56:26.760
Pack your things and go.

56:42.960 --> 56:45.160
Think 'ee've seen th' last o' me?

56:47.400 --> 56:48.600
Let's 'ope so!

56:59.080 --> 57:00.120
Come.

57:02.320 --> 57:04.800
A note from your informant, sir.

57:06.280 --> 57:12.478
A mob calling for revolution
led by Despard and Poldark

57:12.480 --> 57:17.360
stormed Trenwith and
assaulted Sir George Warleggen.

57:19.280 --> 57:23.880
Can such men be deemed loyal
to King and Country?

57:35.480 --> 57:37.318
He is the hero, I am the villain.

57:37.320 --> 57:38.718
So, what's the solution?

57:38.720 --> 57:39.998
Revenge.

57:40.000 --> 57:43.438
The bank has been obliged to issue
paper instead of coin.

57:43.440 --> 57:46.678
How hard can it be t' make
like notes?

57:46.680 --> 57:49.038
You stole him away?
What are you thinkin'?

57:49.040 --> 57:51.718
Lock him in the stables
and call the constables.

57:51.720 --> 57:54.678
Having such a document
in our possession would ensure

57:54.680 --> 57:56.158
immediate arrest.

57:56.160 --> 57:57.998
Death to the monarchy!

57:58.000 --> 57:59.198
We're going!

57:59.200 --> 58:02.040
If he falls, he takes you with him.
