IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:07.808 --> 00:11.612
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:11.645 --> 00:14.148
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:14.182 --> 00:16.117
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:16.150 --> 00:17.385
ARE MEMBERS OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:17.418 --> 00:19.520
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:19.553 --> 00:21.722
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:26.794 --> 00:29.797
[girl sobbing loudly]

00:48.849 --> 00:51.285
AAH!
IT HURTS!

00:51.319 --> 00:54.322
[screaming]

01:02.163 --> 01:03.197
- ALL RIGHT.

01:03.231 --> 01:04.665
- I CAN'T!
- YES, YOU CAN.

01:04.698 --> 01:06.234
- I CAN'T DO IT!
- YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

01:06.267 --> 01:08.469
YOU JUST KEEP PUSHING.
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE ALMOST THERE.

01:08.502 --> 01:09.570
- MAKE IT STOP!

01:09.603 --> 01:12.540
- PUSH, PUSH, PUSH...
- AAH!

01:12.573 --> 01:15.075
- YES, YES, YES, YES,
YES, YES, YES, YES!

01:16.710 --> 01:18.446
- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR HEAD,
LITTLE GUY?

01:18.479 --> 01:21.815
- MY DAD WAS MAKING ME FLY.
- OH?

01:21.849 --> 01:23.684
- WE WERE PLAYING "AIRPLANE,"
AND HE FELL.

01:23.717 --> 01:25.719
- MR. MARSDEN, I NEED TO HEAR
IT FROM YOUR BOY.

01:25.753 --> 01:27.755
- OH, OKAY.
I-I'M SORRY.

01:27.788 --> 01:29.423
- HE DROPPED ME.

01:29.457 --> 01:31.692
- IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
OUR HOME IS SAFE.

01:31.725 --> 01:33.461
MY HUSBAND AND I
ARE GOOD PARENTS.

01:33.494 --> 01:35.129
[baby crying]
- I SEE.

01:35.163 --> 01:36.864
I HAVE ALL I NEED FOR NOW.

01:36.897 --> 01:39.667
- "FOR NOW"?
YOU'RE COMING BACK?

01:39.700 --> 01:41.135
- I'LL MAKE MY REPORT

01:41.169 --> 01:42.770
TO THE ADMINISTRATION
FOR CHILDREN'S SERVICES.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.305
THEY'LL BE IN TOUCH.
- I'M SORRY.

01:44.338 --> 01:46.440
I-IN TOUCH ABOUT WHAT?
- THIS IS CRAZY.

01:46.474 --> 01:49.277
OUR KIDS ARE FINE.
WE'RE FINE.

01:49.310 --> 01:51.245
- SOMEONE WILL CONTACT YOU
WITHIN 24 HOURS.

01:51.279 --> 01:52.646
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
WELL, THANK YOU.

01:54.748 --> 01:56.617
[door closes]

01:56.650 --> 01:59.153
[baby crying]

02:01.789 --> 02:03.591
- A BOY.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.426
NO.

02:05.459 --> 02:07.595
- PLEASE DON'T TAKE HIM.

02:07.628 --> 02:10.364
PLEASE DON'T TAKE HIM.

02:10.398 --> 02:12.333
PLEASE DON'T TAKE HIM!

02:12.366 --> 02:14.468
PLEASE!
NO, COME BACK.

02:14.502 --> 02:17.305
- NO!
DON'T TAKE THEM!

02:17.338 --> 02:18.906
- YOU CAN'T DO THIS!
NO ONE CALLED US.

02:18.939 --> 02:21.275
- THIS IS AN EMERGENCY ORDER
FROM THE CITY OF NEW YORK.

02:21.309 --> 02:22.810
THE CHILDREN ARE BEING REMOVED
FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.212
- THIS IS A MISTAKE.
YOU DIDN'T--

02:24.245 --> 02:25.513
- YOU'LL HAVE A CHANCE
TO HAVE A HEARING.

02:25.546 --> 02:27.448
- MOMMY!
- YOU CAN REQUEST ONE.

02:27.481 --> 02:28.816
- NO, IT'S GONNA BE OKAY!
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY!

02:28.849 --> 02:31.219
- IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT,
SWEETIE!

02:31.252 --> 02:33.954
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY, HONEY.
- [crying]

02:33.987 --> 02:35.489
- IT'S GONNA BE OKAY, HONEY.

02:49.803 --> 02:52.606
[baby crying]

02:52.640 --> 02:54.775
- DAMN CAT.

02:54.808 --> 02:57.811
[baby continues crying]

03:02.716 --> 03:06.287
- CHARLIE, WAKE UP.
IT'S A BABY.

03:08.489 --> 03:10.791
- THEY LEFT A BABY HERE?

03:10.824 --> 03:13.361
WHAT'S WRONG WITH PEOPLE?

03:14.462 --> 03:16.530
- YEAH, WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

03:16.564 --> 03:19.500
ABANDONED NEWBORN,
FOUND AT ST. MATILDA'S CHURCH

03:19.533 --> 03:20.968
AROUND THE CORNER
FROM MERCY HOSPITAL.

03:21.001 --> 03:23.404
- IS THE BABY OKAY?
- SOUNDS LIKE IT, YEAH.

03:23.437 --> 03:25.306
- RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

03:28.642 --> 03:29.977
SIMON.

03:30.010 --> 03:31.545
- OLIVIA, I HAD TO SEE YOU.

03:31.579 --> 03:33.914
- IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

03:33.947 --> 03:36.984
- UH, NICK,
THIS IS MY BROTHER.

03:37.017 --> 03:38.552
UH, SIMON,
THIS ISN'T A GOOD TIME.

03:38.586 --> 03:41.255
- IT'S AN EMERGENCY,
PLEASE.

03:41.289 --> 03:43.324
- I CAN COVER, LIV.

03:43.357 --> 03:44.958
- DO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO.

03:44.992 --> 03:46.994
WE GOT THIS.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.665
- WHAT'S GOING ON, SIMON?

03:51.699 --> 03:55.436
FIVE YEARS,
NOT A WORD, NO CALL.

03:55.469 --> 03:58.472
- I KNOW.
I KNOW. I-I KEPT MEANING TO.

03:58.506 --> 03:59.673
LOOK, IT'S ABOUT MY KIDS.

03:59.707 --> 04:02.376
THE CITY JUST CAME
AND TOOK THEM FROM US.

04:02.410 --> 04:03.577
- YOU HAVE KIDS?

04:03.611 --> 04:05.813
- A STEPSON--
TY, HE'S FIVE--

04:05.846 --> 04:07.848
AND A ONE-YEAR-OLD.

04:07.881 --> 04:09.450
I NAMED HER AFTER YOU.

04:09.483 --> 04:11.519
OLIVIA...

04:11.552 --> 04:13.721
SHE'S YOUR NIECE.

04:15.423 --> 04:16.824
LOOK, THEY JUST--
THEY JUST TOOK THEM.

04:16.857 --> 04:19.460
IT'S MY FAULT,
BUT YOU GOT TO HELP ME.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.648
- I MET TRACY TWO YEARS AGO.
I WAS WORKING AT A CLINIC.

05:14.682 --> 05:18.652
SHE BROUGHT TY IN
FOR A CHECKUP.

05:18.686 --> 05:20.721
WE'RE GONNA GET MARRIED
IN JUNE.

05:20.754 --> 05:22.890
TY ALREADY CALLS ME "DAD."

05:22.923 --> 05:24.858
THAT--THAT'S OLIVIA.

05:24.892 --> 05:27.828
I THINK SHE
KIND OF LOOKS LIKE YOU.

05:27.861 --> 05:30.931
- SIMON, IF YOU WANT MY HELP,
YOU HAVE TO BE HONEST.

05:30.964 --> 05:33.867
THE CITY DOESN'T REMOVE KIDS
WITHOUT A REASON.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.838
- I MADE A MISTAKE.

05:39.973 --> 05:42.476
TWO DAYS AGO,
I ROLLED THROUGH A STOP SIGN

05:42.510 --> 05:44.545
WHEN I WAS IN THE CAR
WITH TRACY AND THE KIDS.

05:44.578 --> 05:45.813
- AND?

05:45.846 --> 05:47.715
- AND THE COP WHO PULLED ME OVER
HAD AN ATTITUDE.

05:47.748 --> 05:49.917
HE MADE ME GET OUT OF THE CAR,
EMPTY MY POCKETS.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.954
AND THAT'S WHEN
HE FOUND THE JOINT.

05:53.987 --> 05:57.491
- OH, I SEE.
- NO, IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

05:57.525 --> 05:59.793
I HAD DENTAL WORK.
I-I LOST A LOT OF WEIGHT.

05:59.827 --> 06:02.663
I COULDN'T EAT, AND I SMOKED
A LITTLE TO BOOST MY APPETITE.

06:02.696 --> 06:05.466
- SO HE ARRESTED YOU
FOR ONE JOINT?

06:05.499 --> 06:06.700
- HE MADE ME PULL IT
OUT OF MY POCKET

06:06.734 --> 06:09.102
AND THEN SAID
IT WAS PUBLIC DISPLAY.

06:09.136 --> 06:11.405
AND HE MUST HAVE CALLED
CHILD SERVICES.

06:11.439 --> 06:14.408
- THAT'S ENOUGH FOR THEM
TO GO TO YOUR HOUSE.

06:14.442 --> 06:15.676
YOU LIVE WITH TRACY?

06:15.709 --> 06:16.977
- YEAH, A WALK-UP
IN WEST HARLEM.

06:17.010 --> 06:19.046
THE SOCIAL WORKER
GOT ALL BENT OUT OF SHAPE

06:19.079 --> 06:20.981
BECAUSE TY HAD A BRUISE.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.885
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

06:24.918 --> 06:28.822
OLIVIA, I SWEAR,
WE WOULD NEVER HURT OUR KIDS.

06:30.157 --> 06:32.493
- DO YOU HAVE A COPY
OF THE REMOVAL ORDER?

06:39.867 --> 06:41.869
- IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU CAN DO?

06:45.673 --> 06:47.975
- I DON'T KNOW, SIMON.
I WILL TRY.

06:52.513 --> 06:54.948
NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH
THIS TIME.

06:54.982 --> 06:56.850
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

06:58.519 --> 07:01.154
- UNDERSTOOD.

07:07.861 --> 07:10.831
- ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO TELL ME?

07:10.864 --> 07:12.700
- [sighs]
IT'S COMPLICATED.

07:14.835 --> 07:17.738
I HAVE A NIECE.
- CONGRATULATIONS.

07:18.872 --> 07:22.142
WHAT DOES HE WANT FROM YOU?

07:22.175 --> 07:24.645
LIV, THE LAST TIME
YOUR BROTHER SHOWED UP,

07:24.678 --> 07:25.879
HE ALMOST COST YOU
YOUR SHIELD.

07:25.913 --> 07:28.849
- CAPTAIN,
HE WAS BEING FRAMED.

07:28.882 --> 07:30.117
- SO WHAT DOES HE WANT?

07:30.150 --> 07:33.687
- LOOK, HE'S THE ONLY FAMILY
THAT I HAVE.

07:33.721 --> 07:36.156
- AND BELIEVE ME,
HE KNOWS IT.

07:37.758 --> 07:39.893
YOU WATCH YOUR STEP.

07:44.832 --> 07:46.834
- THE BABY WAS CARED FOR--

07:46.867 --> 07:49.670
NO SIGNS OF ABUSE,
WRAPPED IN A BLANKET.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.905
WHOEVER LEFT HIM
WANTED HIM TO BE FOUND.

07:51.939 --> 07:53.273
- WHY LEAVE A BABY
ON THE STREET?

07:53.306 --> 07:55.843
THERE'S SAFE-HAVEN LAWS.
- YEAH, SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE

07:55.876 --> 07:58.145
DIDN'T WANT TO DEAL
WITH THE SYSTEM.

07:58.178 --> 08:00.814
- HERE HE IS.
HERE'S OUR BABY.

08:00.848 --> 08:02.683
- HMM.

08:04.552 --> 08:06.286
DOCTOR, CAN YOU TELL
WHEN HE WAS DELIVERED?

08:06.319 --> 08:07.955
- WITHIN 24 HOURS.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.123
THE NURSES TOLD ME
THE UMBILICAL-CORD STUMP

08:10.157 --> 08:11.759
WASN'T EVEN DRY.

08:11.792 --> 08:12.726
- SO IT WAS CUT?

08:12.760 --> 08:14.728
- YES. AND THE FLUID
IN THE LUNGS CLEARED.

08:14.762 --> 08:17.765
- WHOEVER GAVE BIRTH HAD HELP.

08:17.798 --> 08:19.800
- EXCUSE ME, DOCTOR.
I SHOULD FEED HIM.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.902
- OKAY, WE'RE GONNA NEED
A DNA SAMPLE.

08:21.935 --> 08:23.604
- SURE.

08:23.637 --> 08:27.107
- IT'S JUST--
MISSING KIDS I'M USED TO,

08:27.140 --> 08:29.309
BUT FOUND BABIES?

08:29.342 --> 08:30.844
SAME NEIGHBORHOOD CANVASS?

08:30.878 --> 08:33.146
- NO, MAYBE SOMEONE
REMEMBERS A PREGNANT WOMAN...

08:33.180 --> 08:37.785
NOW NOT PREGNANT,
WITH NO BABY.

08:37.818 --> 08:40.988
- I'VE FOUND ALL KINDS OF THINGS
ON THE STREET IN MY DAY--

08:41.021 --> 08:43.757
WALLETS, NEVER A BABY.

08:43.791 --> 08:45.859
- YOU SURE YOU DIDN'T SEE
ANYONE LEAVING THAT BOX?

08:45.893 --> 08:47.995
- THERE A REWARD
IF I SAY I DID?

08:48.028 --> 08:51.298
- THIS KID WASN'T JUST DUMPED
HERE RANDOMLY.

08:51.331 --> 08:54.902
WHOEVER LEFT HIM HERE KNEW
YOU'D DO THE RIGHT THING.

08:54.935 --> 08:57.337
YOU EVER NOTICE
ANYBODY SCOPING YOU OUT?

08:57.370 --> 09:01.141
- WELL, THE OTHER DAY THERE WAS
THIS BEAT-UP RED VAN

09:01.174 --> 09:04.311
THAT WENT AROUND THE BLOCK,
AND THEN IT STOPPED TO WATCH US.

09:04.344 --> 09:08.849
BUT WE JUST FIGURED
IT WAS YOU GUYS.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.317
- I KNOW IT'S
A DIFFERENT COURT SYSTEM.

09:10.350 --> 09:11.685
I UNDERSTAND THAT, DAVID.

09:11.719 --> 09:13.687
I JUST THOUGHT
THAT MAYBE YOU COULD--

09:13.721 --> 09:15.689
I KNOW. I GET IT.
IT'S OKAY.

09:15.723 --> 09:17.691
IT'S OKAY.

09:17.725 --> 09:19.827
YEAH.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.328
YOU TOO.

09:21.361 --> 09:23.831
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.
BYE.

09:23.864 --> 09:25.799
- SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

09:25.833 --> 09:27.835
- THE HOMELESS BUNCH THAT FOUND
THE BABY SAID THEY SAW

09:27.868 --> 09:29.937
A RED VAN DO DRIVE-BYS
FOR A FEW DAYS.

09:29.970 --> 09:33.707
- SO FAR, NOTHING ON THE TRAFFIC
CAMS DURING THAT TIME FRAME.

09:33.741 --> 09:35.943
COULD BE
A RIPPLE WINE FANTASY.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.811
- WHAT ABOUT
THE NEIGHBORHOOD CANVASS?

09:37.845 --> 09:39.780
- EXPANDING THE AREA,
CHECKING ALL HOSPITALS,

09:39.813 --> 09:42.215
BEEN ASKING IF ANY WOMEN CAME IN
WHO HAD JUST GIVEN BIRTH

09:42.249 --> 09:43.617
BUT DIDN'T HAVE A BABY.

09:43.651 --> 09:45.786
THERE'S NO LEADS YET.

09:45.819 --> 09:48.722
- ANYTHING ON THE BABY'S DNA
TO LEAD US BACK TO THE PARENTS?

09:48.756 --> 09:49.823
- WE'RE DOING
A FAMILIAL SEARCH,

09:49.857 --> 09:52.660
STARTING WITH THE STATE
DATABASES--SO FAR, NO HITS.

09:52.693 --> 09:54.662
I MEAN, WE'RE SEARCHING
OTHER DATABASES,

09:54.695 --> 09:57.397
BUT THEY'RE STILL COMPILING
THE NATIONAL REGISTRY.

09:57.430 --> 09:58.799
IT'S SLOW-GOING.

09:58.832 --> 10:00.634
IT'S REALLY
KIND OF UNBELIEVABLE--2012.

10:00.668 --> 10:01.769
- OKAY.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.837
JUST KEEP LOOKING,
KEEP DIGGING.

10:03.871 --> 10:07.207
THIS CASE IS GOING TO BE
A MEDIA CIRCUS.

10:07.240 --> 10:10.377
AND I NEED
EVERYONE FOCUSED.

10:15.015 --> 10:17.818
- I STARTED LOOKING INTO YOUR
BROTHER'S CASE AFTER YOU CALLED.

10:17.851 --> 10:20.320
- HE'S NEVER BEEN CONVICTED
OF ANYTHING.

10:20.353 --> 10:23.857
YOU KNOW, I-I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT CHILD SERVICES

10:23.891 --> 10:25.325
COULD TAKE KIDS
FROM THEIR PARENTS

10:25.358 --> 10:26.827
FOR ONE JOINT.

10:26.860 --> 10:28.361
- THEY CAN DO
AN EMERGENCY REMOVAL

10:28.395 --> 10:30.197
IF THEY DETERMINE IT'S IN THE
BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILDREN.

10:30.230 --> 10:33.166
AND THEY'VE DONE IT BEFORE
AFTER A MINOR POT BUST.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.802
BUT IN ALMOST ALL
THE OTHER INSTANCES,

10:34.835 --> 10:37.170
THE PARENTS
WERE BLACK OR HISPANIC.

10:37.204 --> 10:40.007
- SIMON'S FIANCEE IS BLACK.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.910
SHE WAS IN THE CAR
WHEN HE WAS PULLED OVER.

10:42.943 --> 10:46.246
- HUH.
THAT MAKES SENSE NOW.

10:47.915 --> 10:49.382
- SO YOU'LL TAKE THE CASE.

10:49.416 --> 10:51.919
- THERE'S A CLEAR PATTERN
OF PROFILING,

10:51.952 --> 10:54.321
AND THE ONLY WAY TO GIVE
THE SYSTEM A CONSCIENCE

10:54.354 --> 10:55.956
IS TO CHALLENGE IT.

10:57.357 --> 10:58.859
- THANK YOU.

10:58.892 --> 11:00.694
LOOK, I DIDN'T WANT TO BOTHER
YOU WITH THIS.

11:00.728 --> 11:03.196
YOU KNOW, I CALLED DAVID HADEN.
- DAVID HADEN?

11:03.230 --> 11:05.933
WHY WOULD YOU PULL HIS TIE?

11:05.966 --> 11:09.669
- WE WORKED A CASE TOGETHER
LAST MONTH.

11:11.204 --> 11:12.740
ANYWAY...

11:12.773 --> 11:15.709
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE IT.

11:15.743 --> 11:17.177
- SO...

11:17.210 --> 11:19.012
YOUR BROTHER,
DIFFERENT LAST NAMES--

11:19.046 --> 11:20.680
YOU TWO GROW UP TOGETHER?

11:22.883 --> 11:24.852
- I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THAT SIMON EXISTED

11:24.885 --> 11:27.955
UNTIL ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO.

11:29.522 --> 11:32.993
WE SHARE THE SAME FATHER.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.130
- FAMILY SECRETS.

11:40.133 --> 11:42.836
- YOU FOUND SOMETHING?
- REMEMBER CELIA BARBER?

11:42.870 --> 11:45.172
13-YEAR-OLD, GOT KIDNAPPED
OUTSIDE OF MONTCLAIR

11:45.205 --> 11:46.339
THREE YEARS AGO.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.108
- YEAH.
SHE WAS NEVER FOUND.

11:48.141 --> 11:50.343
- WELL, HER DNA'S
IN THE SYSTEM.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.445
JERSEY STATE POLICE
NEEDED TO RULE HER OUT

11:52.479 --> 11:53.881
AS A DECEASED JANE DOE.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.448
- OKAY, AND THE CONNECTION
TO OUR CASE?

11:55.482 --> 11:57.951
- WELL,
AFTER I EXHAUSTED CODIS,

11:57.985 --> 11:59.753
I RAN OUR BABY JOHN DOE'S DNA

11:59.787 --> 12:01.922
THROUGH OTHER
TRI-STATE DATABASES.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.824
I GOT A MITOCHONDRIAL MATCH.

12:03.857 --> 12:07.294
CELIA IS THE BABY'S MOTHER.

12:07.327 --> 12:09.362
- POLICE REPORT SAYS
SHE WAS SNATCHED UP

12:09.396 --> 12:11.331
BY SOMEONE IN A RED VAN.

12:11.364 --> 12:12.900
- ALL RIGHT,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

12:12.933 --> 12:16.136
SO THIS GIRL WHO IS NOW 16
JUST GAVE BIRTH,

12:16.169 --> 12:18.238
AND THEN SHE
OR WHOEVER SHE'S WITH

12:18.271 --> 12:21.208
DISCARDED THE BABY?

12:21.241 --> 12:23.476
- AT LEAST WE CAN TELL
HER PARENTS SHE'S STILL ALIVE.

12:23.510 --> 12:26.346
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
I'M GUESSING AS OF YESTERDAY,

12:26.379 --> 12:28.415
SHE WAS SOMEWHERE
NEAR THAT HOSPITAL.

12:28.448 --> 12:30.183
SHE'S BEEN MISSING
FOR THREE YEARS.

12:30.217 --> 12:31.985
LET'S FIND HER.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.396
- YOU'RE TELLING ME
CELIA'S ALIVE?

12:43.430 --> 12:46.133
AND I'M A GRANDMOTHER?

12:46.166 --> 12:49.002
- HAVE YOU HAD ANY CONTACT
WITH YOUR DAUGHTER?

12:49.036 --> 12:50.137
- NO...

12:50.170 --> 12:52.973
NOT SINCE THE MORNING SHE--

12:53.006 --> 12:54.574
SHE DISAPPEARED.

12:54.607 --> 12:57.277
- AND SHE WAS
WITH YOUR HUSBAND AT THE TIME.

12:57.310 --> 13:00.247
- MY EX.
I'VE REMARRIED.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.582
- SO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY--

13:02.615 --> 13:05.118
YOU CAST A LOT
OF DOUBT ON HIS STORY.

13:05.152 --> 13:07.254
- IT NEVER MADE ANY SENSE.

13:07.287 --> 13:11.591
THEY WERE OUT ON A BIKE RIDE,
EAGLE ROCK.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.293
I WASN'T THE ONLY ONE
WHO HAD DOUBTS.

13:13.326 --> 13:15.262
THE POLICE
QUESTIONED HIS STORY--

13:15.295 --> 13:20.133
HER GETTING GRABBED
AND--AND PUT IN A VAN.

13:20.167 --> 13:22.102
THEY ASKED IF I...

13:22.135 --> 13:25.805
EVER WORRIED THAT LEO AND HER
WERE TOO CLOSE.

13:27.607 --> 13:31.979
- SO YOU THOUGHT YOUR HUSBAND,
YOUR EX-HUSBAND,

13:32.012 --> 13:34.281
KILLED YOUR DAUGHTER?

13:34.314 --> 13:37.617
- SHE WAS ALWAYS
A DADDY'S GIRL.

13:37.650 --> 13:41.421
I THOUGHT MAYBE SOMETHING
HAPPENED BETWEEN THEM,

13:41.454 --> 13:45.258
AND HE COVERED IT UP.

13:45.292 --> 13:46.927
ARE YOU SURE IT'S HER?

13:46.960 --> 13:50.097
- YEAH, THE DNA MATCHES.

13:50.130 --> 13:52.532
CELIA IS THAT BABY'S MOTHER.

13:54.067 --> 13:56.136
- MY GOD.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.138
SO ALL THESE YEARS
I'VE--I'VE BLAMED LEO

13:58.171 --> 14:02.209
FOR SOMETHING
HE DIDN'T DO?

14:02.242 --> 14:04.044
- WE WERE, UH, RIDING UP
EAGLE ROCK.

14:04.077 --> 14:06.579
SHE GOT AHEAD OF ME.

14:06.613 --> 14:09.116
I SAW A RED VAN
PULL ALONGSIDE.

14:09.149 --> 14:11.318
SOMEONE YANKED HER IN.

14:13.320 --> 14:16.489
I PEDALED HARD AS I COULD
TRYING TO CATCH UP, BUT...

14:16.523 --> 14:20.260
- AND YOU'VE BEEN BLAMING
YOURSELF EVER SINCE.

14:20.293 --> 14:23.330
- I'VE BEEN PRAYING
FOR THIS DAY.

14:26.633 --> 14:29.202
NOBODY WOULD BELIEVE ME.

14:33.306 --> 14:35.108
I HAVE...

14:35.142 --> 14:38.111
NIGHTMARES ABOUT...

14:38.145 --> 14:42.149
CHASING THAT VAN.

14:42.182 --> 14:46.119
I LOST MY MARRIAGE,
MY SAVINGS.

14:46.153 --> 14:50.323
I SPENT ALL MY MONEY ON A P.I.,
TRYING TO FIND CELIA.

14:50.357 --> 14:53.360
- HE EVER COME UP
WITH ANY LEADS?

14:55.228 --> 14:57.464
- UH, TWO YEARS AGO,

14:57.497 --> 15:00.467
HE FOUND A CLERK
IN A THRIFT SHOP

15:00.500 --> 15:04.972
IN EAST ORANGE
WHO RECOGNIZED CELIA'S PICTURE.

15:05.005 --> 15:07.975
- "GIRL STARTED CRYING,

15:08.008 --> 15:10.443
"ASKED THE CLERK
TO CALL HER FATHER.

15:10.477 --> 15:13.613
"THEN THE OLDER WOMAN WITH HER
SAID THAT HER DAUGHTER

15:13.646 --> 15:15.983
WAS ACTING OUT
AND PULLED HER AWAY."

15:16.016 --> 15:20.988
THE CLERK SAID THAT CELIA
WAS SHOPPING FOR BABY CLOTHES.

15:21.021 --> 15:23.123
SHE WAS PREGNANT.

15:23.156 --> 15:24.958
- HOLD UP.

15:24.992 --> 15:26.626
TWO YEARS AGO.
ARE YOU SURE?

15:26.659 --> 15:29.162
- I WENT AND TALKED
TO THAT CLERK MYSELF.

15:31.498 --> 15:36.103
YOU'RE TELLING ME
MY DAUGHTER MIGHT HAVE TWO KIDS.

15:36.136 --> 15:39.172
[cell phone rings]

15:39.206 --> 15:42.175
UH, IT'S MY--MY EX.

15:42.209 --> 15:46.146
UM, I'M GONNA--
I'M GONNA TAKE THIS.

15:46.179 --> 15:48.982
- I THINK WE NEED TO GO TALK
TO THAT CLERK.

15:49.016 --> 15:50.984
- YEAH, FINN, LOOK, I, UH...

15:51.018 --> 15:52.452
I HAVE A COURT THING.

15:52.485 --> 15:54.621
UH, I WAS HOPING THAT YOU COULD,
UH, COVER FOR ME.

15:54.654 --> 15:56.156
- SURE.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.127
- OFFICER WILCOX,
IT'S YOUR TESTIMONY

16:00.160 --> 16:02.295
THAT A ROUTINE TRAFFIC STOP
OF MR. MARSDEN

16:02.329 --> 16:04.731
LED TO A DRUG ARREST
AND A CALL TO CHILD SERVICES?

16:04.764 --> 16:05.765
- YES.

16:05.798 --> 16:08.301
- CAN YOU TELL US
HOW YOU FOUND THE MARIJUANA?

16:08.335 --> 16:10.170
- HE TOOK IT OUT OF HIS POCKET.

16:10.203 --> 16:11.638
THAT'S WHY I ARRESTED HIM,
COUNSELOR.

16:11.671 --> 16:14.007
- MR. MARSDEN SPONTANEOUSLY
PRODUCED A JOINT

16:14.041 --> 16:16.176
WHILE YOU WERE WRITING HIM
A TRAFFIC SUMMONS?

16:16.209 --> 16:18.078
- NO, I DETECTED
THE SMELL OF MARIJUANA.

16:18.111 --> 16:20.313
I ASKED
IF HE HAD ANYTHING ON HIM

16:20.347 --> 16:22.315
HE DIDN'T WANT ME TO FIND
ON MY OWN,

16:22.349 --> 16:24.551
HE TOOK THE JOINT
OUT OF HIS POCKET.

16:24.584 --> 16:26.086
- YOU MUST HAVE QUITE A NOSE.

16:26.119 --> 16:28.488
YOU SMELLED AN UNLIT JOINT
IN MY CLIENT'S POCKET?

16:28.521 --> 16:30.523
- OBJECTION--ARGUMENTATIVE.
- WITHDRAWN.

16:30.557 --> 16:31.658
OFFICER WILCOX,

16:31.691 --> 16:34.061
ARE YOU AWARE THE POLICE
COMMISSIONER ISSUED AN ORDER

16:34.094 --> 16:36.163
LAST FALL
ABOUT HOW TO HANDLE ARRESTS

16:36.196 --> 16:37.297
FOR SMALL AMOUNTS
OF MARIJUANA?

16:37.330 --> 16:40.033
- "NO PUBLIC DISPLAY,
NO ARREST."

16:40.067 --> 16:42.235
BUT MARSDEN SHOWED ME
WHAT HE HAD IN HIS POCKET.

16:42.269 --> 16:45.305
AT THAT POINT,
IT WAS A PUBLIC DISPLAY,

16:45.338 --> 16:46.539
AND I ARRESTED HIM.

16:46.573 --> 16:48.575
- YOU USED THAT
AS A PRETEXT TO ARREST HIM.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.143
- OBJECTION--
I DON'T HEAR A QUESTION.

16:50.177 --> 16:52.645
- WITHDRAWN.

16:52.679 --> 16:56.183
OFFICER WILCOX, HOW MANY
TRAFFIC STOPS HAVE YOU MADE

16:56.216 --> 16:58.318
IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS?

16:58.351 --> 17:01.254
- I'D SAY BETWEEN 60 AND 70.

17:01.288 --> 17:02.589
- 78.

17:02.622 --> 17:05.758
AND IN HOW MANY OF THOSE CASES
DID YOU MAKE AN ARREST

17:05.792 --> 17:08.261
OR WRITE A TICKET
FOR ANOTHER SUMMONS?

17:08.295 --> 17:09.629
- NO IDEA.

17:09.662 --> 17:12.299
- WOULD YOU BE SURPRISED
TO KNOW THE NUMBER IS 22,

17:12.332 --> 17:15.635
AND ALL BUT 3 OF THEM
ABOVE 96TH STREET?

17:15.668 --> 17:18.071
- I HAVE NO OPINION
ABOUT THAT.

17:18.105 --> 17:22.442
- OFFICER WILCOX, I REMIND YOU
THAT YOU'RE UNDER OATH.

17:22.475 --> 17:25.112
WHY DID YOU ASK MY CLIENT
TO EMPTY HIS POCKETS

17:25.145 --> 17:27.180
WHEN HE WAS NOT UNDER ARREST?

17:27.214 --> 17:30.117
- SOMETHING SEEMED OFF TO ME.

17:30.150 --> 17:32.319
- YOU MEAN A WHITE MAN
AND A BLACK WOMAN

17:32.352 --> 17:34.587
DRIVING THROUGH HARLEM WITH
TWO MIXED-RACE KIDS IN THE BACK?

17:34.621 --> 17:36.456
- OBJECTION.

17:36.489 --> 17:39.226
- COUNSELORS, APPROACH.

17:42.195 --> 17:43.830
- YOUR HONOR,
THE STATE IS READY

17:43.863 --> 17:45.698
TO PLEAD THIS DOWN
TO DISORDERLY CONDUCT.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.200
- JUDGE, EVEN THAT'S TOO MUCH.

17:47.234 --> 17:49.469
IT'S A BAD SEARCH,
PURE AND SIMPLE.

17:49.502 --> 17:51.804
- HE'S RIGHT, MS. CALLIER.

17:51.838 --> 17:53.540
I'M GRANTING
THE MOTION TO SUPPRESS.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.242
CASE DISMISSED.

17:55.275 --> 17:57.144
[gavel bangs]

17:57.177 --> 17:58.478
- OH, THANK YOU.

17:58.511 --> 18:00.480
- I FEEL LIKE
I CAN BREATHE AGAIN.

18:00.513 --> 18:02.249
WHEN DO WE GET
TY AND OLIVIA BACK?

18:02.282 --> 18:03.516
- THE NEXT STEP.

18:03.550 --> 18:06.319
BUT CHILD SERVICES
HAS LOST THEIR MAIN RATIONALE.

18:06.353 --> 18:07.687
- NICE WORK, COUNSELOR.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.856
- IT'S WHAT I DO.

18:12.225 --> 18:14.827
- DO YOU WANT
TO MEET YOUR NIECE?

18:15.695 --> 18:18.465
- HI.
[women laugh]

18:18.498 --> 18:20.500
HI. OH.

18:20.533 --> 18:23.903
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

18:23.936 --> 18:26.373
HI, PRETTY.

18:26.406 --> 18:28.775
[gasps]
AND YOU'RE THE MAN, HUH?

18:28.808 --> 18:31.244
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

18:31.278 --> 18:33.546
- LIV...

18:33.580 --> 18:36.349
THIS IS YOUR FAMILY.

18:39.286 --> 18:40.187
YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:40.220 --> 18:41.821
WHEN THE KIDS COME HOME,
WE SHOULD SET UP

18:41.854 --> 18:44.291
A REGULAR SUNDAY DINNER.

18:46.359 --> 18:48.895
- I'D LIKE THAT, SIMON.

18:48.928 --> 18:51.231
- THE CLERK AT THE STORE
IN NEW JERSEY

18:51.264 --> 18:53.533
BACKS UP WHAT LEO GOT
FROM HIS P.I.

18:53.566 --> 18:56.536
- OKAY, TWO YEARS AGO
CELIA WAS PREGNANT.

18:56.569 --> 18:57.837
WAS THAT BABY DISCARDED TOO?

18:57.870 --> 19:01.274
- THERE'S NO CASES OF ABANDONED
BABIES IN EAST ORANGE THAT YEAR.

19:01.308 --> 19:03.343
- YEAH, BUT I'M EXPANDING
THE SEARCH,

19:03.376 --> 19:05.345
AND THE CLOSEST OPEN CASE
IS IN NEWARK.

19:05.378 --> 19:06.746
BUT IT HAPPENED A YEAR BEFORE.

19:06.779 --> 19:08.381
- THAT'S TEN MINUTES
FROM EAST ORANGE.

19:08.415 --> 19:11.184
- IS THERE ANYTHING CONNECTING
THE NEWARK BABY TO OUR CASE?

19:11.218 --> 19:12.852
- UH...

19:12.885 --> 19:15.488
YEAH, IT WAS FOUND LEFT
IN A BOX, WAS WELL CARED FOR.

19:15.522 --> 19:16.823
THE UMBILICAL CORD WAS CUT.

19:16.856 --> 19:19.192
- WRAPPED IN A BLANKET,
ON THE STEPS OF A CHURCH,

19:19.226 --> 19:20.660
HALF A BLOCK
FROM NEWARK GENERAL.

19:20.693 --> 19:24.264
- OKAY, RUN IT DOWN.

19:26.633 --> 19:27.834
- AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE FILE,

19:27.867 --> 19:29.536
THE DRUG CHARGE
HAS BEEN DISMISSED.

19:29.569 --> 19:31.838
THIS COURT HAS NO LEGAL BASIS
TO TAKE THESE CHILDREN

19:31.871 --> 19:33.340
FROM THEIR PARENTS' CUSTODY.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.308
- MR. ELLIS,
DOES YOUR CLIENT DISPUTE

19:35.342 --> 19:36.976
THAT HE HAD MARIJUANA
IN HIS POSSESSION

19:37.009 --> 19:38.678
WHILE HE WAS DRIVING
WITH THE CHILDREN?

19:38.711 --> 19:40.480
- NO, YOUR HONOR,
BUT IT WAS A SINGLE JOINT

19:40.513 --> 19:42.415
USED FOR MEDICAL PURPOSES.

19:42.449 --> 19:43.983
- STILL ILLEGAL IN THIS STATE.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.685
- IT'S NOT JUST
ABOUT THE MARIJUANA.

19:45.718 --> 19:48.388
ON MY FOLLOW-UP VISIT, I FOUND
THAT THE HOME WAS DISORGANIZED

19:48.421 --> 19:51.791
AND THAT THE OLDER BOY, TY,
HAD A BRUISE ON HIS FOREHEAD.

19:51.824 --> 19:53.693
- WHICH HE SUSTAINED
ACCIDENTALLY.

19:53.726 --> 19:54.894
- I SEE HERE THAT MR. MARSDEN

19:54.927 --> 19:57.997
HAS A HISTORY OF CONTACT
WITH THE POLICE.

19:58.030 --> 20:01.334
HE WAS A SUSPECT IN A RAPE CASE,
JUMPED BAIL.

20:01.368 --> 20:03.002
- HE WAS CLEARED ON ALL COUNTS.

20:03.035 --> 20:04.837
AND THOSE CHARGES
WERE THE RESULT

20:04.871 --> 20:07.907
OF A PERSONAL VENDETTA BY
A NOW-DISGRACED POLICE OFFICER.

20:07.940 --> 20:09.842
- BE THAT AS IT MAY,
MR. ELLIS,

20:09.876 --> 20:11.844
WHERE THERE'S SMOKE,
THERE'S FIRE.

20:11.878 --> 20:12.812
THE STATE HAS AN INTEREST

20:12.845 --> 20:15.515
IN PROTECTING
THE WELFARE OF THE CHILDREN.

20:15.548 --> 20:16.849
WE'VE HAD TOO MANY CASES

20:16.883 --> 20:20.019
WHERE NEGLECT AND ABUSE
HAVE LED TO TRAGIC RESULTS.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.954
- YOUR HONOR, WHAT'S IN THE BEST
INTEREST OF THESE CHILDREN

20:21.988 --> 20:24.824
IS THAT THEY BE
WITH LOVING PARENTS.

20:24.857 --> 20:27.026
IN SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES,
WITH TWO WHITE PARENTS,

20:27.059 --> 20:29.496
THESE CHILDREN
WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN REMOVED.

20:29.529 --> 20:32.031
THIS IS UNCONSCIONABLE.

20:32.064 --> 20:34.734
OUR COUNTRY
PROHIBITED DISCRIMINATION

20:34.767 --> 20:36.736
AGAINST MIXED-RACE COUPLES
DECADES AGO.

20:36.769 --> 20:38.638
- ENOUGH, MR. ELLIS.

20:38.671 --> 20:41.974
WE'LL REVISIT MR. MARSDEN'S
CIRCUMSTANCES IN SIX MONTHS

20:42.008 --> 20:43.976
ON THE CONDITION
THAT HE COMPLETES DRUG REHAB.

20:44.010 --> 20:48.381
IN THE MEANTIME, THE CHILDREN
WILL REMAIN IN FOSTER CARE.

20:48.415 --> 20:52.619
NEXT.
[gavel bangs]

20:55.021 --> 20:56.155
- THIS IS CRAZY.

20:56.188 --> 20:59.359
THEY DROPPED THE POT CHARGE.
HOW CAN THEY KEEP MY KIDS?

20:59.392 --> 21:00.527
- THE SMOKING-GUN THEORY.

21:00.560 --> 21:01.861
POSSESSION
IS CONSIDERED EVIDENCE

21:01.894 --> 21:03.696
THAT OTHER ABUSE OR NEGLECT
COULD BE GOING ON.

21:03.730 --> 21:05.365
- WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
WITH TY AND OLIVIA?

21:05.398 --> 21:06.999
THEY'RE IN A FOSTER HOME.
THEY'RE SCARED.

21:07.033 --> 21:09.702
- WE'RE GONNA FIGHT THIS, TRACY.
- YEAH, RIGHT.

21:09.736 --> 21:11.638
THEY WILL NOT LET US
KEEP OUR KIDS NO MATTER WHAT.

21:11.671 --> 21:14.374
- SIMON, NOBODY'S TALKING
ABOUT QUITTING HERE, OKAY?

21:14.407 --> 21:15.708
YOU GOT TO TRUST ME ON THIS.

21:15.742 --> 21:17.544
- LIV, YOU KNOW
WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH.

21:17.577 --> 21:20.580
WHAT, NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME
I SHOULD TRUST THE SYSTEM?

21:26.453 --> 21:28.355
- CAPTAIN, WE THINK
WE FOUND THE CONNECTION

21:28.388 --> 21:30.423
BETWEEN CELIA'S BABY AND
THE BABY ABANDONED IN NEWARK.

21:30.457 --> 21:31.691
- ENLIGHTEN ME.

21:31.724 --> 21:34.361
- WE RAN THE DNA,
AND CELIA'S NOT THE MOTHER

21:34.394 --> 21:35.528
OF THE FIRST BABY.

21:35.562 --> 21:38.365
BUT BOTH BOYS
DO HAVE THE SAME FATHER.

21:38.398 --> 21:42.001
- SO WHAT ARE WE LOOKING
AT HERE?

21:42.034 --> 21:45.872
- WE'RE NOT SURE,
BUT THE FATHER--

21:45.905 --> 21:50.042
HE'S BEEN AT THIS FOR YEARS.

21:50.076 --> 21:53.079
- [sighs]

21:57.417 --> 21:59.118
- SO, FOUR DAYS AGO,
BABY JOHN DOE NUMBER ONE

21:59.151 --> 22:01.388
WAS ABANDONED
ON WEST 33RD STREET.

22:01.421 --> 22:03.423
THREE YEARS AGO,
BABY JOHN DOE NUMBER TWO

22:03.456 --> 22:04.924
WAS ABANDONED IN NEWARK--

22:04.957 --> 22:08.361
BOTH WELL CARED FOR,
BOTH LEFT NEAR HOSPITALS.

22:08.395 --> 22:11.564
- AND THEY SHARE PATERNAL DNA,
SAME FATHER, STILL NO HITS?

22:11.598 --> 22:12.932
- SO FAR, NO.

22:12.965 --> 22:15.067
WHOEVER HE IS, JOHNNY APPLESEED
HASN'T BEEN LOCKED UP

22:15.101 --> 22:17.103
SINCE THE SYSTEM
WAS PUT IN PLACE.

22:17.136 --> 22:19.706
- ANY MATCHES TO OTHER
ABANDONED BABIES, MISSING KIDS?

22:19.739 --> 22:21.674
- SO FAR, NO.
BUT IT'S A STATE-BY-STATE,

22:21.708 --> 22:24.010
LAB-BY-LAB SEARCH, SO...
[phone chimes]

22:24.043 --> 22:26.713
- OKAY, WHAT ABOUT THE POLICE
REPORT ON BABY JOHN DOE TWO?

22:26.746 --> 22:29.682
ANY RED VAN OR WITNESSES?
- NOTHING.

22:29.716 --> 22:33.720
AND THE HOSPITAL THAT TREATED
HIM CLOSED DOWN LAST YEAR.

22:33.753 --> 22:37.724
BUT THE SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCY
THAT PLACED THE BABY--

22:37.757 --> 22:39.392
THEY'RE STILL AROUND.

22:39.426 --> 22:41.794
- AH, GOOD LUCK
GETTING HELP WITH THAT.

22:41.828 --> 22:44.664
- WELL, ROLLINS...

22:44.697 --> 22:46.833
YOU ALWAYS SAID YOU WANTED ME
TO SHOW YOU NEWARK.

22:46.866 --> 22:49.702
- OOH, DREAMS DO COME TRUE.

22:53.740 --> 22:56.108
- OF COURSE I REMEMBER DYLAN--
OUR MIRACLE BABY.

22:56.142 --> 22:57.343
- WHY DO YOU CALL HIM THAT?

22:57.376 --> 23:00.012
- COMPLETELY HEALTHY WHEN HE WAS
FOUND, WRAPPED IN A BLANKET,

23:00.046 --> 23:01.714
UMBILICAL CORD TAKEN CARE OF.

23:01.748 --> 23:03.450
HE EVEN HAD OINTMENT
ON A CUT ON HIS ARM.

23:03.483 --> 23:04.350
- AND YOU NEVER HEARD

23:04.383 --> 23:06.185
FROM ANYONE CLAIMING TO BE
THE PARENT?

23:06.218 --> 23:09.422
- I DIDN'T, BUT NOW THAT YOU
MENTION IT, THE FOSTER FAMILY--

23:09.456 --> 23:11.491
THEY ADOPTED DYLAN
TWO YEARS AGO.

23:11.524 --> 23:13.726
I GOT A STRANGE CALL
FROM THEM LAST SUMMER.

23:13.760 --> 23:14.794
THEY WANTED TO KNOW

23:14.827 --> 23:15.995
IF THERE WAS A STATUTE
OF LIMITATIONS

23:16.028 --> 23:19.866
ON WHEN BIOLOGICAL PARENTS
CAN TRY TO RECLAIM THE CHILDREN.

23:22.469 --> 23:24.704
- I'M SO SORRY THAT SIMON GOT--
- NO, I DON'T BLAME HIM.

23:24.737 --> 23:26.439
THE CITY OF NEW YORK
STRIPPING CHILDREN

23:26.473 --> 23:27.640
FROM THEIR PARENTS' ARMS

23:27.674 --> 23:29.609
IS A CLEAR ABUSE
OF GOVERNMENT POWER.

23:29.642 --> 23:31.010
- SO WHAT CAN WE DO?

23:31.043 --> 23:33.680
- I'VE BEEN REVIEWING
JUDGE SUAREZ'S DECISIONS.

23:33.713 --> 23:35.715
IN CASES INVOLVING
ONE OR TWO MINORITY PARENTS,

23:35.748 --> 23:37.584
SHE'S UPHELD THE REMOVAL
OF THE CHILDREN.

23:37.617 --> 23:39.519
SHE'S RULED THE OTHER WAY

23:39.552 --> 23:41.654
IN CASES INVOLVING
TWO WHITE PARENTS.

23:41.688 --> 23:44.624
I'M TRYING TO SET UP A HEARING,
GET HER RULING OVERTURNED.

23:44.657 --> 23:45.892
- DO YOU WANT SIMON THERE?

23:45.925 --> 23:48.127
- ONLY IF YOU CAN KEEP
HIM CALM.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.630
BLOWING UP IN COURT
IS NOT GOING TO HELP.

23:55.067 --> 23:58.871
- LOOK, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
THE N.Y.P.D. IS AT OUR HOUSE.

23:58.905 --> 24:00.206
WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG.

24:00.239 --> 24:02.241
- YEAH, WE'RE FOLLOWING UP
ON A RELATED CASE.

24:02.274 --> 24:03.409
- OKAY,
BECAUSE YOU ASKED QUESTIONS

24:03.442 --> 24:07.079
ABOUT DYLAN'S BIOLOGICAL PARENTS
AND THEIR RIGHTS, RIGHT?

24:07.113 --> 24:09.582
WHY?

24:13.219 --> 24:16.856
- SOMETHING HAPPENED IN JULY.

24:16.889 --> 24:18.124
WE WERE IN THE CITY,

24:18.157 --> 24:21.193
HOUSE-SITTING
FOR JENNA'S FOLKS.

24:21.227 --> 24:24.030
- A YOUNG GIRL CAME UP TO US
IN CENTRAL PARK...

24:24.063 --> 24:26.198
HOMELESS.

24:26.232 --> 24:29.736
SHE ASKED
HOW OLD DYLAN WAS...

24:29.769 --> 24:32.038
THEN SHE SAID
HE WAS HER BABY,

24:32.071 --> 24:35.708
THAT HE HAD BEEN TAKEN.

24:35.742 --> 24:39.579
WHEN WE FIRST ADOPTED DYLAN,
THE TIMES RAN AN ARTICLE.

24:39.612 --> 24:41.714
THERE WAS A PICTURE OF US
IN CENTRAL PARK.

24:41.748 --> 24:43.516
SHE KEPT IT.
- IT'S NOTHING.

24:43.550 --> 24:44.751
SHE WAS JUST CRAZY.

24:44.784 --> 24:48.287
- BUT YOU TOOK IT SERIOUSLY
ENOUGH TO CALL SOCIAL SERVICES.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.388
- AND OUR LAWYER--
HE SAID AT THAT POINT,

24:49.421 --> 24:51.824
MORE THAN TWO YEARS
AFTER DUMPING DYLAN IN A BOX,

24:51.858 --> 24:53.192
SHE FORFEITED HER RIGHTS.

24:53.225 --> 24:54.761
- YEAH, BUT...

24:54.794 --> 24:56.629
YOU THINK THERE MIGHT BE
SOMETHING TO IT.

24:56.663 --> 25:00.567
- WELL, SHE SAID SHE'D BEEN
COMING TO THE PARK FOR YEARS,

25:00.600 --> 25:02.702
HOPING TO FIND US.

25:02.735 --> 25:06.606
SHE PICKED UP DYLAN'S HAT
AND SNIFFED IT...

25:06.639 --> 25:09.776
SAID THAT'S
WHEN SHE KNEW FOR SURE.

25:09.809 --> 25:12.845
- OKAY, CAN YOU DESCRIBE HER?

25:14.981 --> 25:17.750
- WILL TOOK A PICTURE
WITH HIS CELL PHONE,

25:17.784 --> 25:22.021
IN CASE WE NEEDED TO FILE
A RESTRAINING ORDER.

25:22.054 --> 25:25.758
- YOU RECOGNIZE HER?
- YEAH, THAT'S LORI.

25:25.792 --> 25:28.227
CAME IN EVERY TUESDAY
FOR CHICKEN NOODLE AND CRACKERS.

25:28.260 --> 25:30.029
THAT'S HALF THE REASON
WE CALLED HER "CRACKERS."

25:30.062 --> 25:31.063
- I'LL BET I CAN GUESS
THE OTHER HALF.

25:31.097 --> 25:33.833
- SHE HAD AN OLD
PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE FOR LITHIUM

25:33.866 --> 25:35.668
WE TRIED TO GET HER TO REFILL.
- LITHIUM--

25:35.702 --> 25:38.204
BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS
FOR BIPOLAR ADOLESCENTS.

25:38.237 --> 25:39.639
HOW OLD IS SHE?

25:39.672 --> 25:41.040
- LATE TEENS,
BUT A LOT OF MILEAGE.

25:41.073 --> 25:42.842
SOMETHING HAPPENED TO HER,
PUT HER OVER THE EDGE.

25:42.875 --> 25:44.644
- SHE SAY WHAT?

25:44.677 --> 25:46.879
- SHE HAD SOME STORY
ABOUT BEING KIDNAPPED

25:46.913 --> 25:48.581
AND HELD IN A DUNGEON.

25:48.615 --> 25:51.784
BUT THEN A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE
HAVE A STORY.

25:51.818 --> 25:54.654
- AND WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW HER?

25:54.687 --> 25:55.722
- LAST SUMMER.

25:55.755 --> 25:57.223
SAID SHE FOUND HER BABY,

25:57.256 --> 25:59.726
WAS GOING TO BECOME
A REAL MOM.

25:59.759 --> 26:01.728
- YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHERE SHE'D BE NOW?

26:01.761 --> 26:03.730
- AFRAID NOT.

26:03.763 --> 26:07.133
- LET'S START
WITH WOMEN'S SHELTERS.

26:07.166 --> 26:09.602
- THANKS FOR COVERING FOR ME.
SO...

26:09.636 --> 26:11.037
WHAT HAVE WE GOT?

26:11.070 --> 26:13.205
- MUNCH AND ROLLINS HIT
EVERY SOUP KITCHEN IN THE CITY,

26:13.239 --> 26:14.707
FOUND THE HOMELESS GIRL, LORI,

26:14.741 --> 26:16.242
AT A SHELTER
SIX BLOCKS FROM HERE.

26:16.275 --> 26:17.243
I CAN TAKE IT MYSELF--

26:17.276 --> 26:19.946
- NO, I'M GOOD.
- OLIVIA!

26:19.979 --> 26:21.848
- MEET YOU IN THE CAR.

26:21.881 --> 26:23.816
- THANK YOU.

26:23.850 --> 26:25.718
HEY, SIMON, IT'S NOT
A GREAT TIME--I'M WORKING.

26:25.752 --> 26:27.620
- LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO, ALL RIGHT?

26:27.654 --> 26:29.021
WE VISITED TY AND OLIVIA,

26:29.055 --> 26:30.690
THEY DON'T LIKE THE FOOD
IN THE FOSTER HOME.

26:30.723 --> 26:32.091
THEY'RE CRYING.
THEY'RE HUNGRY.

26:32.124 --> 26:33.392
AND THEN I OVERHEARD
SOMEONE SAYING

26:33.425 --> 26:34.493
THEY COULD PUT THEM UP
FOR ADOPTION?

26:34.526 --> 26:36.663
- HOLD ON. ELLIS IS NOT GOING
TO LET THAT HAPPEN.

26:36.696 --> 26:38.097
HE'S TRYING TO SCHEDULE
A HEARING

26:38.130 --> 26:39.999
TO GET THE RULING OVERTURNED.
- WHEN?

26:40.032 --> 26:41.701
- YOU GOT TO GIVE HIM
A CHANCE

26:41.734 --> 26:43.970
TO DO HIS JOB, SIMON--
HE'S A PRO.

26:44.003 --> 26:46.639
- DON'T KEEP TELLING ME THAT.
IF THEY TAKE AWAY MY KIDS--

26:46.673 --> 26:48.708
- LOOK, SIMON, WHY DON'T YOU
GO HOME AND BE WITH TRACY?

26:48.741 --> 26:51.778
THERE'S REALLY NOTHING
THAT YOU CAN DO RIGHT NOW.

26:57.917 --> 26:59.719
- YOU KNOW THE SONG
I JUST WANNA BE OK

26:59.752 --> 27:01.721
BY INGRID MICHAELSON?

27:01.754 --> 27:03.890
THAT WAS ME--I COULDN'T FEEL
COMFORTABLE ANYWHERE.

27:03.923 --> 27:05.725
THAT'S WHY I WAS
ALWAYS RUNNING AWAY.

27:05.758 --> 27:07.727
[chuckles awkwardly]

27:07.760 --> 27:09.896
- BUT YOUR PARENTS
NEVER REPORTED YOU MISSING.

27:09.929 --> 27:11.831
- I ALWAYS CAME BACK.

27:11.864 --> 27:13.833
EXCEPT THAT LAST TIME
I COULDN'T

27:13.866 --> 27:16.836
'CAUSE THEY TOOK ME
AND KEPT ME LOCKED UP.

27:16.869 --> 27:20.740
- WHO'S "THEY," LORI?

27:20.773 --> 27:23.075
- A MAN AND HIS WIFE.

27:23.109 --> 27:27.246
THEY MADE ME CALL THEM
"MOMMY" AND "DADDY."

27:27.279 --> 27:29.782
- AND WHERE'D THEY FIND YOU?

27:29.816 --> 27:31.818
- OUTSIDE OF PENN STATION,
BEGGING FOR A TRAIN TICKET HOME

27:31.851 --> 27:34.086
BACK TO MASSAPEQUA.

27:34.120 --> 27:35.888
SAID THEY'D GIVE ME A RIDE
IN THEIR VAN.

27:35.922 --> 27:38.791
I THOUGHT IT WAS OKAY
'CAUSE THEY WERE A COUPLE.

27:38.825 --> 27:40.993
- REMEMBER WHAT
THEY LOOKED LIKE?

27:44.263 --> 27:48.234
- HE WAS BIG...

27:48.267 --> 27:50.837
AND SWEATY...

27:50.870 --> 27:52.839
AND NOT A LOT OF HAIR,

27:52.872 --> 27:56.743
AND SHE WAS SHORTER
WITH LONG, DARK HAIR.

27:56.776 --> 27:59.879
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHERE THEY TOOK YOU?

27:59.912 --> 28:01.781
- THEY MUST'VE DRUGGED ME,

28:01.814 --> 28:03.783
'CAUSE WHEN I WOKE UP,
I WAS IN A ROOM.

28:03.816 --> 28:07.219
I THINK IT WAS A BASEMENT,
'CAUSE I COULD HEAR A BOILER.

28:07.253 --> 28:09.421
[cell phone vibrates]

28:09.455 --> 28:12.091
- OKAY, DID THEY
EVER LET YOU OUT?

28:12.124 --> 28:14.260
- ONCE OR TWICE,
BUT WE DIDN'T GO FAR.

28:14.293 --> 28:17.764
- DID YOU RECOGNIZE ANYTHING--

28:17.797 --> 28:19.165
LANDMARKS, BUILDINGS?

28:19.198 --> 28:23.235
- A COUPLE BLOCKS UP,
THERE WAS A TALL BUILDING--

28:23.269 --> 28:26.705
UH, SILVER WINDOWS,
ALL GIANT TRIANGLES.

28:27.940 --> 28:31.343
- THE HEARST BUILDING
ON 57TH?

28:31.377 --> 28:34.747
- AND HOW DID THEY
TREAT YOU, LORI?

28:34.781 --> 28:36.783
- OKAY.

28:36.816 --> 28:38.918
THEY DIDN'T BEAT ME.

28:38.951 --> 28:42.922
BUT HE GAVE ME, UH,
LEMONADE AND VODKA.

28:42.955 --> 28:45.858
IT MADE IT EASIER
WHEN HE GOT ON TOP OF ME.

28:48.895 --> 28:51.798
- HOW LONG
DID THEY KEEP YOU THERE?

28:51.831 --> 28:54.100
- OVER A YEAR...

28:54.133 --> 28:55.802
UNTIL I HAD MY BABY.

28:55.835 --> 28:57.937
AND HE SAID,

28:57.970 --> 29:00.807
"NO BOYS IN THE HOUSE."

29:04.977 --> 29:07.847
AFTER THEY TOOK MY BABY,
I COULDN'T STOP CRYING.

29:07.880 --> 29:09.548
SO HE PUT ME IN A VAN
AND DUMPED ME

29:09.581 --> 29:10.850
BY YANKEE STADIUM.

29:14.120 --> 29:18.057
- EXCUSE ME
FOR ONE SECOND.

29:18.090 --> 29:20.559
CAPTAIN, WHAT'S GOING ON?

29:20.592 --> 29:22.428
- WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU TALKED TO YOUR BROTHER?

29:22.461 --> 29:23.429
- ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

29:23.462 --> 29:26.098
HE'S BEEN CALLING ME,
BUT I DIDN'T PICK UP.

29:26.132 --> 29:28.400
- DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS?

29:28.434 --> 29:31.103
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

29:31.137 --> 29:33.806
WHAT'S GOING ON?

29:33.840 --> 29:36.275
- SIMON AND HIS FIANCEE

29:36.308 --> 29:38.945
JUST KIDNAPPED THE CHILDREN
FROM FOSTER CARE.

29:38.978 --> 29:42.815
THERE'S AN AMBER ALERT OUT
FOR THEM.

29:42.849 --> 29:46.085
HE'S BEEN CALLING YOU?
I'M GONNA NEED YOUR PHONE.

29:46.118 --> 29:49.355
YOU DON'T HAVE
A CHOICE HERE, LIV.

30:03.535 --> 30:05.537
- N.Y.P.D.

30:05.571 --> 30:07.106
- [grunts]

30:07.139 --> 30:09.141
- HEY, TAKE IT EASY, SERGEANT.
HE'S NOT RESISTING.

30:09.175 --> 30:10.076
- OH, GOD, THEY CALLED YOU.

30:10.109 --> 30:12.511
- SHUT UP! WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?
- N.Y.P.D.

30:12.544 --> 30:14.213
- CAPTAIN CRAGEN,
MANHATTAN SPECIAL VICTIMS.

30:14.246 --> 30:15.547
- WELL, THAT'S NICE,

30:15.581 --> 30:16.983
BUT WE'RE ARRESTING
THIS PUNK FOR KIDNAPPING.

30:17.016 --> 30:18.317
- LOOK, SERGEANT,

30:18.350 --> 30:20.052
WE DON'T HAVE TO TURN THIS
INTO A FEDERAL CASE.

30:20.086 --> 30:22.054
THE CALL CAME FROM OUR SIDE
OF THE RIVER, KIDS ARE INVOLVED.

30:22.088 --> 30:24.490
AFTER YOU FILE,
LET US TAKE CUSTODY.

30:24.523 --> 30:25.992
LOOK, I PROMISE,

30:26.025 --> 30:28.027
IF ANYBODY'S GOING TO HAVE
A PROBLEM HERE,

30:28.060 --> 30:29.295
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE YOU.

30:32.631 --> 30:34.166
- YOU CAN FOLLOW US
TO BOOKING.

30:34.200 --> 30:35.267
- SIMON.

30:41.908 --> 30:43.175
- ARE YOU OKAY?

30:43.209 --> 30:44.944
- THANK GOD
I LOVE BOLOGNA SANDWICHES.

30:44.977 --> 30:47.246
- I JUST--
SIMON...

30:47.279 --> 30:50.049
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?
- I--

30:50.082 --> 30:53.352
OBVIOUSLY I WASN'T,
YOU KNOW?

30:53.385 --> 30:55.321
TRACY'S GOT SOME FAMILY
IN SOUTH CAROLINA.

30:55.354 --> 30:57.189
I THOUGHT...

30:57.223 --> 31:00.993
OH, MAYBE WE'D STAY WITH THEM
FOR A WHILE, BUT...

31:01.027 --> 31:03.996
OH, LIV...

31:04.030 --> 31:07.934
[sighs]
I MESSED UP.

31:07.967 --> 31:10.937
- YEAH, YOU DID.

31:10.970 --> 31:14.073
- ALL I WANT IS
TO BE A GOOD FATHER.

31:14.106 --> 31:16.075
- I KNOW THAT.

31:21.113 --> 31:23.549
- THE WEIRD THING IS,

31:23.582 --> 31:26.052
MY OWN DAD
WAS A BETTER FATHER TO ME

31:26.085 --> 31:28.387
THAN I'VE BEEN
TO MY KIDS.

31:32.391 --> 31:35.527
JUST WHAT YOU NEED TO HEAR.
[sighs]

31:39.098 --> 31:42.501
IF YOU'RE DONE WITH ME,
I COMPLETELY UNDER--

31:42.534 --> 31:45.137
- PLEASE STOP, SIMON.
PLEASE, JUST STOP.

31:48.374 --> 31:52.011
[sighs]

31:52.044 --> 31:56.015
LOOK, I'LL TALK TO ELLIS.

31:56.048 --> 31:58.050
BAIL'S GONNA BE HARD.

31:58.084 --> 31:59.318
- I GET THAT.

32:03.722 --> 32:06.358
OLIVIA...

32:06.392 --> 32:08.527
I'M SORRY.

32:08.560 --> 32:12.198
- YOU WANT TO BE
A GOOD FATHER, SIMON?

32:12.231 --> 32:15.067
GROW UP.

32:19.171 --> 32:21.707
- LORI, DURING ALL THAT TIME
IN THE BASEMENT,

32:21.740 --> 32:26.345
THE MAN AND THE WOMAN
ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE YOU SAW?

32:26.378 --> 32:29.481
- I HEARD
OTHER PEOPLE SOMETIMES.

32:29.515 --> 32:32.051
THEY WOULD HAVE PARTIES
IN THE COURTYARD.

32:32.084 --> 32:34.053
- DID YOU EVER TRY AND CALL OUT
FOR HELP?

32:34.086 --> 32:35.687
- I KNEW
THERE WERE RULES.

32:35.721 --> 32:38.157
BUT ONCE, WHEN THE POLICE CAME,
I STARTED SCREAMING.

32:38.190 --> 32:39.525
THEN MOMMY CAME IN

32:39.558 --> 32:42.094
AND GAGGED ME
AND DRUGGED ME WITH A NEEDLE.

32:42.128 --> 32:43.762
- ARE YOU SURE
IT WAS THE POLICE?

32:43.795 --> 32:46.198
- I HEARD THE RADIOS.

32:46.232 --> 32:50.036
UH, I THINK SOMEONE
MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN SHOT.

32:50.069 --> 32:52.038
- YOU HEARD A GUNSHOT?

32:52.071 --> 32:56.042
- YEAH, AND THEN
A MAN SCREAMING AND SIRENS.

32:56.075 --> 32:58.544
- YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN THIS WAS,
DO YOU?

32:58.577 --> 33:01.547
- UH, JULY 5TH,
MY FIRST YEAR WITH THEM.

33:01.580 --> 33:04.083
I HEARD THE FIREWORKS
THE NIGHT BEFORE.

33:10.089 --> 33:13.592
I DON'T REALLY WANT TO GO
BACK TO THE SHELTER.

33:13.625 --> 33:18.064
- I DON'T BLAME YOU, LORI.

33:18.097 --> 33:20.432
I'LL TRY AND MAKE
SOME PHONE CALLS,

33:20.466 --> 33:23.569
GET YOU IN A PLACE WHERE YOU
CAN GET YOURSELF BACK TOGETHER.

33:27.406 --> 33:31.077
- YOUR HONOR, MY CLIENTS
ARE IN NO WAY A FLIGHT RISK.

33:31.110 --> 33:33.079
WHAT THEY WANT,
MORE THAN ANYTHING,

33:33.112 --> 33:34.780
IS TO BE REUNITED
WITH THEIR CHILDREN.

33:34.813 --> 33:38.550
- THAT'S ONE WAY
TO RATIONALIZE KIDNAPPING.

33:38.584 --> 33:40.386
SINCE MS. HARRISON
HAS NO RECORD,

33:40.419 --> 33:41.753
I'LL GRANT BAIL.

33:41.787 --> 33:44.156
BUT MR. MARSDEN
HAS JUMPED BEFORE.

33:44.190 --> 33:46.458
I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE HIM
THE CHANCE TO DO IT AGAIN.

33:46.492 --> 33:49.828
BAIL DENIED.
[gavel bangs]

33:49.861 --> 33:51.497
- SO WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

33:51.530 --> 33:53.165
- WE'VE LOST THE HIGH GROUND.

33:53.199 --> 33:55.701
IT'S ONE THING TO ARGUE THE CITY
HAD NO RIGHT TO TAKE HIS KIDS.

33:55.734 --> 33:57.603
BUT SECOND-DEGREE KIDNAPPING
IS A CLASS "B" FELONY.

33:57.636 --> 33:59.138
HE COULD GET 25.

33:59.171 --> 34:02.541
- LOOK, THERE'S GOT TO BE A WAY
TO REDUCE THE CHARGES.

34:02.574 --> 34:04.310
BAYARD, I HATE
TO KEEP PUSHING YOU, BUT--

34:04.343 --> 34:05.677
- I KNOW HE'S FAMILY,

34:05.711 --> 34:08.080
BUT YOUR BROTHER'S MADE IT
VERY HARD ON HIMSELF.

34:08.114 --> 34:09.381
I CAN TRY TO PLEAD
THIS THING DOWN,

34:09.415 --> 34:10.849
BUT HOW AM I GOING TO ARGUE
THAT THE KIDS

34:10.882 --> 34:12.551
ARE GOING TO BE RETURNED
TO A STABLE HOME?

34:12.584 --> 34:15.087
- SO WHAT ABOUT FILING
A CLASS-ACTION SUIT?

34:15.121 --> 34:16.088
YOU SAID IT YOURSELF--

34:16.122 --> 34:17.256
- I'M PREPARING TO DO THAT,

34:17.289 --> 34:18.524
BUT I'VE GOT TO FIND
A DIFFERENT TEST CASE.

34:18.557 --> 34:22.194
YOUR BROTHER--HE'S NOT A GOOD
CANDIDATE FOR LEAD PLAINTIFF.

34:22.228 --> 34:23.795
- DROVE LORI
THROUGH HELL'S KITCHEN.

34:23.829 --> 34:26.732
NOTHING LOOKED FAMILIAR
EXCEPT THE HEARST BUILDING.

34:26.765 --> 34:29.101
- WHICH YOU CAN SEE
FOR 20 BLOCKS.

34:29.135 --> 34:31.170
- LORI SAID SHE HEARD A MAN
SCREAM AND POLICE RADIOS

34:31.203 --> 34:32.871
ON FOURTH OF JULY WEEKEND.

34:32.904 --> 34:34.373
ANY POLICE REPORTS MATCH UP?

34:34.406 --> 34:36.375
- YEAH, I MEAN,
THERE'S DOZENS, BUT...

34:36.408 --> 34:38.710
I MEAN, IT'S MOSTLY NEIGHBORS
COMPLAINING ABOUT FIRECRACKERS.

34:38.744 --> 34:40.212
- FOURTH OF JULY,
THREE-DAY WEEKEND--

34:40.246 --> 34:41.713
A LOT FALLS
THROUGH THE CRACKS.

34:41.747 --> 34:42.648
CHECK THE LOCAL E.R.s TOO.

34:42.681 --> 34:44.883
- SOMEBODY'S GONNA REMEMBER
AN INCIDENT

34:44.916 --> 34:46.718
FROM, WHAT, 3 1/2 YEARS AGO?

34:46.752 --> 34:49.855
WHAT ARE THE ODDS ON THAT?

34:49.888 --> 34:53.091
- EASY.
IT'S JUST AN EXPRESSION.

34:55.894 --> 34:57.896
- OH, THE RAT SLAYER.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.865
WE GET A LOT OF WEIRD CASES,
BUT THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME

34:59.898 --> 35:02.734
WE HAD A GUY SAY
HIS UNCLE SHOT HIM IN THE FOOT

35:02.768 --> 35:04.403
WHILE HE WAS AIMING
FOR A RAT.

35:04.436 --> 35:05.871
- SOUNDS LIKE A DRINK
MIGHT HAVE BEEN INVOLVED.

35:05.904 --> 35:08.740
- OH, MORE THAN ONE.
HE WASN'T FEELING ANY PAIN.

35:08.774 --> 35:09.908
- WHY, 'CAUSE HE WAS SO DRUNK?

35:09.941 --> 35:11.910
- WELL THAT, AND THE WOUND
HAD BEEN WELL TAKEN CARE OF

35:11.943 --> 35:13.212
BEFORE HE EVEN GOT HERE.

35:13.245 --> 35:14.746
- WELL, HOW SO?

35:14.780 --> 35:17.183
- HIS AUNT BROUGHT HIM IN--
MAGDA PLASKY.

35:17.216 --> 35:19.251
SHE WORKS HERE.

35:19.285 --> 35:20.919
- AND WHAT DOES SHE DO?

35:20.952 --> 35:24.456
- ONE OF OUR BEST
NEONATAL NURSES.

35:24.490 --> 35:28.294
- HOW LONG HAS SHE BEEN HERE?
- ABOUT A YEAR.

35:28.327 --> 35:31.563
- YOU REMEMBER
WHERE SHE WORKED BEFORE?

35:31.597 --> 35:32.798
MAYBE JERSEY?

35:32.831 --> 35:34.733
- WELL, YES, ACTUALLY.

35:34.766 --> 35:38.170
WE PICKED HER UP
AFTER NEWARK GENERAL CLOSED.

35:40.906 --> 35:43.909
- MAGDA, GIVE US A MINUTE?
- CAN'T NOW.

35:43.942 --> 35:45.911
I HAVE A BABY IN THE NICU
WHO NEEDS A TRANSFUSION.

35:45.944 --> 35:49.415
- DON'T MAKE US CHASE YOU.

35:49.448 --> 35:51.550
- MY SHIFT ENDS IN AN HOUR.
I COULD TALK TO YOU THEN.

35:51.583 --> 35:54.720
- TRY NOW.

35:54.753 --> 35:58.557
WHERE'S CELIA?

35:58.590 --> 36:00.226
- I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU MEAN.

36:00.259 --> 36:01.927
- THAT BABY
THAT WAS ABANDONED LAST WEEK--

36:01.960 --> 36:05.897
YOU KNOW
WHERE HIS MOTHER IS.

36:05.931 --> 36:07.899
- IT'S OVER.

36:07.933 --> 36:09.735
YOU WORKED AT THE HOSPITAL
IN NEWARK

36:09.768 --> 36:12.838
NEAR WHERE LORI'S SON
WAS FOUND.

36:12.871 --> 36:13.872
- HEY.

36:13.905 --> 36:18.210
YOU MADE SURE BOTH BABIES
WERE TAKEN CARE OF.

36:21.280 --> 36:22.848
OKAY?

36:25.784 --> 36:29.988
- THEN YOU KNOW I NEVER LET
ANYTHING BAD HAPPEN TO THEM.

36:30.021 --> 36:33.259
IT'S JUST
DADDY DIDN'T WANT BOYS.

36:35.994 --> 36:37.863
- YOUR HUSBAND, YOU MEAN.

36:37.896 --> 36:40.866
WE KNOW THIS IS ON HIM,
NOT YOU.

36:40.899 --> 36:44.670
SO JUST TELL US
WHERE HE'S KEEPING CELIA.

36:54.012 --> 36:56.282
- WHICH WAY, MAGDA?

37:19.004 --> 37:21.740
IT'S LOCKED FROM THE OUTSIDE.
HE'S NOT IN THERE.

37:21.773 --> 37:23.275
CELIA?

37:29.948 --> 37:33.018
- WE'RE CLEAR.

37:33.051 --> 37:34.953
- CELIA.

37:37.623 --> 37:39.758
IT'S OKAY.

37:39.791 --> 37:42.694
IT'S OKAY.

37:44.095 --> 37:47.433
YOU'RE SAFE NOW.

37:47.466 --> 37:50.902
COME ON, HONEY.
- NO.

37:50.936 --> 37:52.871
DON'T HURT HER.

37:54.940 --> 37:56.442
- WHO?

37:56.475 --> 37:58.710
[toddler shouts]

38:04.483 --> 38:05.884
- MAY I?

38:05.917 --> 38:07.919
[toddler shouts]
- HI, SWEETHEART.

38:07.953 --> 38:09.755
IT'S OKAY, BABY.

38:09.788 --> 38:11.757
IT'S OKAY.

38:11.790 --> 38:13.425
HI.

38:16.728 --> 38:19.598
- [fusses]
- IT'S OKAY, BABY GIRL.

38:19.631 --> 38:22.634
IT'S OKAY.

38:22.668 --> 38:25.571
- WHERE'S YOUR HUSBAND?
- I DON'T KNOW. HE'S THE SUPER.

38:25.604 --> 38:27.439
- CALL HIM,
GET HIM DOWN HERE NOW.

38:27.473 --> 38:29.641
[cell phone beeping]

38:31.977 --> 38:35.013
- JOHN?

38:35.046 --> 38:36.582
[speaking Polish]

38:36.615 --> 38:40.352
- WATCH HER.
COVER THE EXITS, TAKE THE FRONT.

38:42.921 --> 38:44.356
POLICE!

38:44.390 --> 38:46.024
STOP!

39:03.942 --> 39:05.777
- SVU PORTABLE TO CENTRAL--

39:05.811 --> 39:08.680
WE'RE IN FOOT PURSUIT
AT 329 WEST 45TH STREET.

39:24.830 --> 39:27.766
- POLICE! STOP!

39:27.799 --> 39:30.802
[sirens wailing]

39:46.084 --> 39:48.987
[handcuffs clicking]

39:51.490 --> 39:52.858
IT'S OVER, DADDY.

39:59.831 --> 40:02.968
- I KNOW YOU THINK
YOU SAVED THOSE GIRLS,

40:03.001 --> 40:06.071
BUT I WAS THEIR WHOLE WORLD.

40:06.104 --> 40:08.574
THEY'LL NEVER FORGET ME.

40:08.607 --> 40:12.077
- I'VE HEARD ENOUGH.

40:12.110 --> 40:15.013
- LET'S GET HIM OUT OF HERE.

40:15.046 --> 40:18.584
- I NEED A SHOWER.
WE'RE DONE.

40:18.617 --> 40:21.853
- I'LL CALL THE D.A.
- HOW'S THE GIRL?

40:21.887 --> 40:23.922
- CELIA'S REUNITING
WITH HER FAMILY.

40:23.955 --> 40:26.091
HER FATHER'S GOING TO PETITION
TO HAVE CUSTODY OF THE BABY

40:26.124 --> 40:27.626
AND HER TWO-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER.

40:27.659 --> 40:29.961
- AND WHAT ABOUT
THE FIRST VICTIM, LORI?

40:29.995 --> 40:32.097
- SHE'S GETTING HELP,
AND THE ADOPTIVE PARENTS

40:32.130 --> 40:35.000
HAVE AGREED TO LET HER
HAVE VISITATION.

40:35.033 --> 40:36.802
- THAT'S NICE WORK, EVERYBODY.

40:36.835 --> 40:41.106
[cell phone rings]

40:41.139 --> 40:44.109
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

40:44.142 --> 40:45.944
IT'S YOUR BROTHER?

40:45.977 --> 40:47.979
- YEAH.

40:51.817 --> 40:54.586
SO ELLIS WORKED OUT A DEAL
BETWEEN CHILDREN'S SERVICES

40:54.620 --> 40:56.655
AND THE D.A.'S OFFICE.

40:56.688 --> 40:59.257
- THEY'LL REDUCE THE KIDNAPPING
TO CUSTODIAL INTERFERENCE--

40:59.290 --> 41:00.926
A MISDEMEANOR.

41:00.959 --> 41:02.928
- SO THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?
- YES.

41:02.961 --> 41:04.930
YOU ONLY HAVE
TO SERVE 60 DAYS.

41:04.963 --> 41:07.966
- AND WHAT ABOUT THE KIDS?
WAIT. SHOULDN'T TRACY BE HERE?

41:11.002 --> 41:12.938
- SIMON, TRACY HAD TO GET
HER OWN LAWYER.

41:12.971 --> 41:15.807
THEY HAD TO SEPARATE THE CASES.

41:15.841 --> 41:19.277
IT WAS THE ONLY WAY FOR TRACY
TO REGAIN CUSTODY.

41:19.310 --> 41:22.013
- HER--WAIT.
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

41:22.047 --> 41:24.115
- ONE OF THE CONDITIONS
FOR REDUCING YOUR CHARGES

41:24.149 --> 41:26.117
IS THAT YOU GIVE UP
YOUR CUSTODY PETITION.

41:26.151 --> 41:27.953
- GIVE UP MY DAUGHTER?

41:27.986 --> 41:29.955
- THE JUDGE HAS RULED THAT YOU
CAN ONLY VISIT YOUR CHILDREN

41:29.988 --> 41:32.257
IN A SUPERVISED SETTING
FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS.

41:32.290 --> 41:33.925
YOU'LL HAVE TO MOVE
OUT OF THE APARTMENT,

41:33.959 --> 41:35.093
GET YOUR OWN PLACE.

41:35.126 --> 41:37.529
- WAIT. WHAT?
ARE YOU KIDDING?

41:37.563 --> 41:39.898
IS THIS THE BEST
THAT HE COULD DO?

41:39.931 --> 41:42.801
- SIMON, IT'S BETTER
THAN YOUR DAUGHTER

41:42.834 --> 41:45.637
VISITING YOU IN JAIL.

41:45.671 --> 41:49.040
YOU WERE LOOKING AT 25 YEARS.

41:49.074 --> 41:52.210
- THE JUDGE WILL RECONSIDER
THE TERM AT THE END OF THE YEAR

41:52.243 --> 41:54.613
IF YOU DON'T VIOLATE
YOUR PAROLE.

41:54.646 --> 41:57.916
- AND--WAIT--
AND TRACY WENT ALONG WITH THIS?

41:59.751 --> 42:01.186
NO, WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.

42:01.219 --> 42:04.756
- NOT RIGHT NOW, SON.

42:04.790 --> 42:06.958
SHE NEEDS SOME TIME.

42:15.000 --> 42:18.670
- SO THAT'S IT?

42:18.704 --> 42:21.873
[knock at door,
buzzer sounds]

42:23.675 --> 42:27.613
I REALLY THOUGHT I COULD GET
IT RIGHT THIS TIME.

42:27.646 --> 42:30.849
- I KNOW.

42:32.818 --> 42:35.320
ME TOO.
