Max! Have you
been here all night?

01:31.373 --> 01:34.140
Are you crazy?
I went home to get my robe.

01:35.573 --> 01:36.940
What's up
with those rollers?

01:37.006 --> 01:38.773
Oh! Oh, oh, oh!

01:38.840 --> 01:42.106
Was an experiment. I had
to do something at 4:00 a. m..

01:42.173 --> 01:45.173
And that's all
you could think of?

01:45.240 --> 01:46.706
Made you a pot‐holder.

01:54.940 --> 01:56.940
‐ Maxine.
‐ Yeah?

01:57.006 --> 02:00.306
Look, I know it's been rough
being suspended from work..

02:00.373 --> 02:03.080
...and girl, you know
you're like a sister to me

02:03.146 --> 02:05.646
but you've just been chillin'
all up and through here

02:05.713 --> 02:07.946
for the past four weeks.

02:08.013 --> 02:09.880
What are you trying to say?

02:09.946 --> 02:11.880
‐ Go home.
‐ It's time.

02:14.646 --> 02:16.380
You again?

02:16.446 --> 02:21.046
Max, you're like a wad of gum
stuck to the bottom of my life.

02:23.180 --> 02:25.213
What do you people
want me to do?

02:25.280 --> 02:27.513
I just can't sit around
my place all day

02:27.580 --> 02:30.313
waiting for Evans and Bell
to call me back to work.

02:30.380 --> 02:33.213
[crying]
Why not?

02:33.280 --> 02:36.213
'Cause I've already had
my phone calls forwarded here.

02:39.880 --> 02:42.846
Good morning,
my little crumpet.

02:42.913 --> 02:45.180
Good morning,
my handsome hash brown.

02:47.313 --> 02:49.746
Hey, you two make breakfast
really unattractive.

02:51.813 --> 02:54.780
You ladies know Miss Meg,
that nice elderly woman

02:54.846 --> 02:57.613
about ye high, who lives across
the street in Max's building?

02:57.680 --> 02:59.313
‐ 'Yeah.'
‐ 'Mmm‐hmm.'

02:59.380 --> 03:01.320
You think she's a serial killer?

03:02.786 --> 03:03.920
No!

03:03.986 --> 03:06.086
‐ Why?
‐ No reason.

03:06.153 --> 03:09.253
Just thought I saw her draggin'
a dead body to her car.

03:10.120 --> 03:12.386
‐ Wait!
‐ What?

03:12.453 --> 03:16.086
‐ Morning, people.
‐ Overton, you are bugging.

03:16.153 --> 03:18.986
That sweet old lady
is not a murderer.

03:19.053 --> 03:21.820
Overton, man, are you still
on this Miss Meg thing?

03:21.886 --> 03:23.586
I saw what I saw.

03:23.653 --> 03:25.820
Uh‐huh. Now, tell the ladies
what you watched

03:25.886 --> 03:27.920
on television last night.

03:27.986 --> 03:31.220
‐ "Dial M for Murder."
‐ Mm‐hmm.

03:31.286 --> 03:32.853
‐ "Psycho."
‐ Mm‐hmm.

03:32.920 --> 03:34.220
And "The Wrath of Khan."

03:34.286 --> 03:36.553
‐ Your point?
‐ Has been made.

03:37.853 --> 03:39.020
[telephone ringing]

03:39.086 --> 03:41.920
Don't! I got it!
Oh, sorry.

03:41.986 --> 03:43.920
I'm here,
don't worry yourself.

03:46.286 --> 03:48.820
Maxine Shaw.

03:48.886 --> 03:50.386
Yes.

03:50.453 --> 03:52.586
Mmm‐hmm.

03:52.653 --> 03:54.520
Okay. Bye.

03:57.786 --> 04:00.526
That was Evans and Bell.
They want me at work tomorrow.

04:00.593 --> 04:01.960
I'm...back!

04:02.026 --> 04:03.960
[all cheering]

04:06.126 --> 04:09.426
Okay? Hey,
you know what I mean.

04:09.493 --> 04:12.126
There you go.
Hey! Ah!

04:12.193 --> 04:15.626
‐ Hey, baby, I love you!
‐ She's back! She's back!

04:17.660 --> 04:18.593
Yo!

04:25.760 --> 04:27.693
Ah‐h.

04:30.093 --> 04:32.126
Whoo!

Fluorescent light.

04:35.793 --> 04:38.393
Oh, headphones.

04:40.260 --> 04:42.693
Oh! Stapler.

04:47.326 --> 04:48.260
[laughing]

04:49.660 --> 04:52.126
Tracy, we're out of staples.

04:52.193 --> 04:54.260
Welcome back, Max.

04:54.326 --> 04:55.593
It's good to be back.

04:55.660 --> 04:57.593
Oh, look at that.
Come here, girl.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.733
City.

05:01.800 --> 05:05.533
A city filled with contract
disputes, personal injuries

05:05.600 --> 05:08.400
bad marriages...
at 125 bucks an hour.

05:08.466 --> 05:10.233
Let's get started.

05:10.300 --> 05:11.400
‐ Fire away.
‐ Okay.

05:11.466 --> 05:12.666
First, I need
the depositions

05:12.733 --> 05:13.933
for the Bentley
embezzlement case.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.200
Then, a precedent

05:15.266 --> 05:17.533
for the Harris vs.
The Cherry Hill Tattoo Parlor.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.833
This can't be the first time
a customer's asked

05:19.900 --> 05:22.333
for "Satan rules",
and got "Santa rules" instead.

05:24.066 --> 05:26.000
‐ Ah!
‐ Knock‐knock.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.633
Glad to see you
settling in, Max.

05:31.700 --> 05:35.566
A good lawyer never settles.

05:35.633 --> 05:36.666
He he.

05:41.200 --> 05:44.200
Yes, well, I hope your extended
vacation gave you time to think

05:44.266 --> 05:46.466
about how your over‐zealousness
almost lost us

05:46.533 --> 05:48.200
our biggest client.

05:48.266 --> 05:50.733
Mr. Evans, my time off
was a virtual reflect‐a‐thon.

05:50.800 --> 05:53.533
Not only did I reflect on how
I over‐stepped my bounds..

05:53.600 --> 05:56.333
...I also thought about how
I can improve my win‐loss ratio

05:56.400 --> 05:58.133
dispose of my
case load more efficiently

05:58.200 --> 06:00.473
and I learned French!

06:02.973 --> 06:04.573
Lovely!

06:04.640 --> 06:06.606
You understand
we had to give your cases

06:06.673 --> 06:09.573
to other attorneys
during your absence.

06:09.640 --> 06:11.340
Natural‐mo.

06:11.406 --> 06:13.606
And you understand
that you'll have to help

06:13.673 --> 06:16.940
some of the new associates
before taking on any more cases?

06:18.873 --> 06:21.306
Absolu‐mo!

06:23.140 --> 06:24.873
I'm glad we're
on the same page.

06:24.940 --> 06:28.006
One other thing, our tax
department is expanding.

06:28.073 --> 06:31.340
So we're moving you
to a office down the hall.

06:31.406 --> 06:33.906
You mean one of those
cubby holes with no windows?

06:33.973 --> 06:35.240
<i>Oui.</i>

06:38.173 --> 06:39.873
Anything else?

06:39.940 --> 06:42.773
Max. Max, let me say this.

06:42.840 --> 06:45.840
If it were up to my partner,
you'd never see the inside

06:45.906 --> 06:47.573
of this law firm again.

06:47.640 --> 06:50.640
But I convinced him that we'd
look pretty stupid if we lost

06:50.706 --> 06:52.806
a lawyer of your caliber
to another firm.

06:57.606 --> 06:59.706
Oh, another thing.

06:59.773 --> 07:02.380
It'd have been more useful
if you'd to learn Spanish.

07:06.946 --> 07:08.880
Estupido!

07:11.646 --> 07:12.813
Enough.

07:14.546 --> 07:16.480
Khadijah, paper plates?

07:16.546 --> 07:18.846
Oh, you volunteerin' to wash
dishes after the party.

07:18.913 --> 07:20.513
Carry on.

07:22.046 --> 07:24.180
Synclaire, I am really
impressed that you made

07:24.246 --> 07:25.680
all these decorations
by yourself.

07:25.746 --> 07:27.580
We needed a theme.

07:27.646 --> 07:30.413
Could you hand me one of those
little electric chairs.

07:36.246 --> 07:37.613
That's sick.
That's..

07:39.480 --> 07:42.246
Oh, think Miss Meg
about to make a move.

07:43.646 --> 07:45.980
Overton, man,
the woman uses a cane.

07:46.046 --> 07:49.480
Yeah, in the right hands
it's an effective murder weapon.

07:51.013 --> 07:53.680
But wait, what's that
in your orthopedic shoes?

07:53.746 --> 07:56.180
Why, it's poisoned spikes!

08:02.286 --> 08:05.553
Yeah, you just laugh it up,
Little Lord Fauntelroy.

08:08.120 --> 08:10.420
But always remember,
in the movies it's always

08:10.486 --> 08:13.420
the skeptical one
that get's it first.

08:14.786 --> 08:16.586
Oh, please.
Overton, you know what, man?

08:16.653 --> 08:19.153
I am really sick of you
and about this. Alright?

08:19.220 --> 08:20.686
Now, I'm sure
it's just a‐‐

08:20.753 --> 08:22.686
Oh, my God!

08:24.353 --> 08:28.220
That's right.
Hannibal Lecter with dentures.

08:28.286 --> 08:31.853
Wow, Miss Meg really
is holding a corpse.

08:31.920 --> 08:34.352
She's in great shape
for an old biddy!

08:35.486 --> 08:37.120
Let me see. Let me see.

08:37.186 --> 08:39.620
Oh, too late.
She just went inside.

08:41.352 --> 08:44.653
Obie, are you sure it isn't
just one of those scary movies

08:44.720 --> 08:45.920
you saw the other night?

08:45.986 --> 08:48.186
No, Synclaire,
I saw the body, too.

08:48.253 --> 08:50.153
Besides, I can
tell the difference

08:50.220 --> 08:52.953
between reality
and movie magic.

08:53.020 --> 08:55.620
Wait, wait. Remember the time
we went to see "Alien"?

08:55.686 --> 08:58.186
You spent the whole night up
worrying something was gonna

08:58.253 --> 09:00.226
pop out of that mole
on your arm.

09:00.293 --> 09:01.393
Pffft. Aah!

09:03.693 --> 09:04.926
Yeah.

09:04.993 --> 09:07.493
Well, I would expect you
not to believe me, Khadijah.

09:07.560 --> 09:08.860
You're a skeptic.

09:08.926 --> 09:11.860
But, Synclaire,
I'm your man.

09:15.426 --> 09:17.926
Don't you worry, Overton.
I'm with you on this one.

09:17.993 --> 09:19.226
We're gonna bust Miss Meg.

09:19.293 --> 09:22.026
Now, she might be old,
but she ain't above the law.

09:23.960 --> 09:26.026
When I'm receiving
the mayor's medal of honor

09:26.093 --> 09:27.560
I'll be sure to thank you.

09:27.626 --> 09:30.126
Even though we both know
that you didn't support me

09:30.193 --> 09:32.126
when...I needed it most.

09:33.826 --> 09:36.326
Oh, thank you. Sometimes,
I think I don't deserve you.

09:36.393 --> 09:38.293
Believe me, you do.

09:41.626 --> 09:43.126
Good evening, people.

09:43.193 --> 09:45.126
[all cheering]

09:47.960 --> 09:50.760
So...how was your first day
back at Evans and Bell?

09:50.826 --> 09:52.393
[sighing]
It was great!

09:52.460 --> 09:54.426
<i>Magnifique!</i>

09:54.493 --> 09:58.660
‐ I quit.
‐ No!

10:06.966 --> 10:10.223
Max, you just went back to work.
How could you quit?

10:10.289 --> 10:11.423
I had to.

10:11.489 --> 10:13.989
They gave away my cases,
moved me into a cubicle

10:14.056 --> 10:17.723
and they asked me
out to lunch for sushi.

10:17.789 --> 10:20.223
I hate sushi!

10:20.289 --> 10:23.723
Me, too. Sushi can
give you parasites.

10:25.756 --> 10:28.356
It's the green horseradish
that gets to me.

10:29.923 --> 10:32.156
You couldn't have given
this a little more thought?

10:32.223 --> 10:35.156
Well, hell, I tried it
with ginger, I tried it with..

10:36.589 --> 10:39.189
I tried it with soy sauce.
I tried it..

10:39.256 --> 10:41.189
You're not even
talking to me, huh?

10:46.123 --> 10:48.623
Khadijah, I am not
going back. Bump that.

10:48.689 --> 10:50.656
They made it very clear
they would never

10:50.723 --> 10:53.789
stop punishing me
for what I did. So..

10:53.856 --> 10:56.056
Oh, I understand, Max.

10:56.123 --> 10:59.656
I know what it's like to be
trapped in a job you can't stand

10:59.723 --> 11:01.496
trapped like a wolf
in a clamp.

11:01.563 --> 11:04.563
You just wanna chew off
your own paw just to be free.

11:04.629 --> 11:05.863
Just gnaw.

11:09.096 --> 11:12.196
And then,
Khadijah hired me.

11:12.263 --> 11:14.896
It's good to be free.
Let the sun shine in.

11:17.396 --> 11:20.163
You got to scrape your fins
on that one, baby girl.

11:21.596 --> 11:24.296
Max, I know things
was kinda tight at work.

11:24.363 --> 11:26.563
I'm saying
it was a paycheck right.

11:26.629 --> 11:29.563
And a place for you
to go everyday, right.

11:32.196 --> 11:34.163
I mean, couldn't you have
at least waited

11:34.229 --> 11:35.996
until you had
another job lined up?

11:37.829 --> 11:40.196
You are all forgetting
that I am Maxine Shaw

11:40.263 --> 11:42.496
the baddest attorney of law.

11:42.563 --> 11:44.296
Now there've been
offers in the past

11:44.363 --> 11:45.829
there'll be plenty
in the future.

11:45.896 --> 11:49.829
All I have to do is sit here,
and wait for your phone to ring.

11:52.629 --> 11:54.696
Oh, no.

11:54.763 --> 11:57.896
See, honey, when you left,
I had the phones re‐forwarded

11:57.963 --> 11:59.963
back to your crib.

12:00.029 --> 12:01.669
I know. I had them
re‐re‐forwarded.

12:01.736 --> 12:03.169
No!

12:03.236 --> 12:05.736
You've got to get up
pretty early in the morning

12:05.803 --> 12:07.303
to get one over on me!

12:07.369 --> 12:09.636
Yes, because
evil never sleeps.

12:11.103 --> 12:13.036
But ugly gets plenty of rest.

12:17.669 --> 12:19.703
Dissing Kyle.

12:19.769 --> 12:21.836
I guess you really
are okay, huh?

12:21.903 --> 12:24.169
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

12:24.236 --> 12:27.336
Well, I'm glad, Max.
So since you gonna be home a lot

12:27.403 --> 12:30.003
would you let me put some
suction mounted parabolic

12:30.069 --> 12:32.936
microphones on your ceiling,
so I can listen in

12:33.003 --> 12:34.936
on what Miss Meg's up to?

12:37.636 --> 12:40.569
If you're looking
for someone to worry about..

12:49.303 --> 12:51.236
(Max)
'Khadijah.'

12:51.303 --> 12:52.936
‐ Khadijah.
‐ What?

12:53.003 --> 12:54.269
That cover letter and resume

12:54.336 --> 12:56.403
aren't folded
into perfect thirds.

12:56.469 --> 12:58.903
Then you could be
foldin' 'em your damn self.

13:00.403 --> 13:03.676
Come on, Khadijah, these are the
kind of things employers notice.

13:03.743 --> 13:06.076
No wonder I haven't
received any offers.

13:06.143 --> 13:08.409
I've offered to throw
your ass off the roof.

13:10.209 --> 13:12.076
Max, these things take time.

13:12.143 --> 13:14.109
You've only been
out of work one week.

13:14.176 --> 13:16.909
And four week's
suspension before that.

13:16.976 --> 13:19.909
If I don't sue someone
soon, I'll die!

13:21.443 --> 13:23.043
Regine, let go.

13:23.109 --> 13:24.976
I gotta check
the depth of field

13:25.043 --> 13:27.143
and make sure the F‐stop
is properly adjusted.

13:27.209 --> 13:30.309
Well, I've gotta put film
in the camera, Jughead.

13:37.076 --> 13:39.009
There you go, genius.

13:40.976 --> 13:43.509
Get over that spying
on that old lady.

13:43.576 --> 13:45.476
Y'all should be ashamed
of yourselves.

13:45.543 --> 13:47.909
No, it's the police
that need to be ashamed.

13:47.976 --> 13:49.443
We've been down there
three times

13:49.509 --> 13:50.843
telling them
about Miss Meg.

13:50.909 --> 13:53.843
And now, we ain't allowed
within 200 feet of the precinct.

13:55.509 --> 13:58.109
Well, has Miss. Meg done
anything out of the ordinary?

13:58.176 --> 14:01.149
Well, let's just take
a little look at the log.

14:01.216 --> 14:02.816
8:00 a. m., sharp

14:02.883 --> 14:04.983
10:00 a. m.,
takes three blue pills.

14:05.049 --> 14:07.449
11:30, drags body
in front door.

14:07.516 --> 14:09.449
It's the same thing everyday.

14:11.316 --> 14:13.449
Someone's approachin'
the building!

14:13.516 --> 14:16.283
Middle‐aged man,
striped polyester pants

14:16.349 --> 14:18.949
wallabies,
large canvas sack.

14:20.149 --> 14:22.516
Ooh, not a good look!

14:22.583 --> 14:24.383
Mailman!

14:28.283 --> 14:31.016
I just hope she doesn't get any
more rejection letters today.

14:31.083 --> 14:35.116
Me, too! Every rejection
means 100 more resumes.

14:35.183 --> 14:38.116
I am tired of licking the back
of Patsy Cline's head!

14:39.749 --> 14:42.449
Obie, Obie, I think
I got something.

14:42.516 --> 14:45.116
The couple in 3‐B
just had a argument

14:45.183 --> 14:46.916
and from the look on his face

14:46.983 --> 14:49.083
he just found out
that baby ain't his!

14:51.416 --> 14:55.583
Regine, sometimes I feel you're
motivated by sheer nosiness

14:55.649 --> 14:57.749
and not the pursuit
of truth and justice.

14:59.883 --> 15:01.323
Yeah, so?

15:02.889 --> 15:05.389
Three more law firms have
thanked me for my interest

15:05.456 --> 15:07.023
but I've nothing available.

15:07.089 --> 15:11.423
But the good news is, I get ten
CDs for a penny, if I act now.

15:11.489 --> 15:13.423
Don't do it, Max.
It's a trap.

15:14.589 --> 15:17.089
Max, may be you should
just call Evans and Bell

15:17.156 --> 15:18.723
and ask for your job back.

15:18.789 --> 15:21.223
That would be like
admitting I was wrong.

15:21.289 --> 15:22.389
And I wasn't.

15:22.456 --> 15:25.323
It's not gonna happen, Khadijah.

15:25.389 --> 15:28.356
Hey! This one's
from Pearlman, Horn and, Kocek.

15:28.423 --> 15:31.456
They're the ones who made you
the offer before Evans and Bell.

15:34.723 --> 15:36.189
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Blah, blah, blah.

15:36.256 --> 15:38.256
Et cetera, et cetera.
Yes!

15:38.323 --> 15:40.056
They want a meet with me.

15:40.123 --> 15:43.389
Hey, see, Khadijah, she does
have a prayer in hell.

15:47.956 --> 15:49.923
Regine, I've solved the case.

15:49.989 --> 15:52.223
There's an abandoned apartment
across the street.

15:52.289 --> 15:55.556
It's been completely trashed.
It's gotta be the crime scene.

15:58.156 --> 16:00.096
Well, no,
that's Max's apartment.

16:01.296 --> 16:03.796
You know, Max, the city
will pick that stuff up

16:03.863 --> 16:06.596
every Wednesday if you
just put it all outside.

16:11.063 --> 16:13.463
You know,
I miss helping Max.

16:13.529 --> 16:16.496
Typing, stuffing envelopes,
making copies.

16:16.563 --> 16:18.829
It was all so soothing.

16:18.896 --> 16:21.629
Well, in that case, there's
a big soothing pile of work

16:21.696 --> 16:23.529
on your desk at the office.

16:23.596 --> 16:25.529
It's practically a spa.

16:28.729 --> 16:32.629
Alright you naysayers...
say nay to is.

16:32.696 --> 16:36.163
We got three rolls
of hard evidence.

16:36.229 --> 16:38.463
Plus the shot of Synclaire
trying to blow out

16:38.529 --> 16:40.396
the trick candles
on her birthday cake.

16:40.463 --> 16:42.396
You guys!

16:43.863 --> 16:46.563
Look at this.
Miss Meg dragging the body.

16:46.629 --> 16:48.929
Well, just
call him John Doe.

16:48.996 --> 16:51.263
Here she is,
putting John into the car.

16:51.329 --> 16:53.896
Oh, that really is a body.

16:53.963 --> 16:56.063
Oh, I should've
had faith in you.

16:57.896 --> 17:00.296
Don't worry, my little
sweet potato pie.

17:00.363 --> 17:03.636
Just being able to say, "I told
you so" is its own reward.

17:05.469 --> 17:07.469
Overton, I have
solved the case.

17:07.536 --> 17:09.469
Here is your dead body.

17:12.336 --> 17:15.336
It's called a safety man.
Miss Meg puts him in the car

17:15.403 --> 17:18.069
so it doesn't look
like she's driving alone.

17:18.136 --> 17:20.236
You sure it's not
just a crafty alibi?

17:21.403 --> 17:22.868
Come on,
give it up, Overton.

17:22.935 --> 17:24.669
When I went to talk to her

17:24.736 --> 17:26.969
she'd just gotten off
the phone with the police.

17:27.036 --> 17:30.136
She reported a couple of
peeping toms across the street.

17:32.736 --> 17:34.469
Unbelievable!

17:34.536 --> 17:37.236
I cannot tell the difference
between a real man

17:37.303 --> 17:39.269
and a rubber one
from 50 feet away.

17:39.336 --> 17:41.236
I'm losing my touch!

17:42.336 --> 17:46.469
Maxine Shaw, Esquire
in the house.

17:46.536 --> 17:48.636
Hey, two scare crows
looking for a brain.

17:53.069 --> 17:54.803
So I guess
the interview went well?

17:54.869 --> 17:56.969
I was on.

17:57.036 --> 17:58.269
By the time I finished

17:58.336 --> 18:00.776
they were asking me
when I could start.

18:00.843 --> 18:03.143
Girl, I have not
seen you this happy

18:03.209 --> 18:05.976
since you won that negligence
suit against that bra company.

18:07.543 --> 18:10.143
Snap in the front, someone's
bound to lose an eye.

18:11.643 --> 18:13.609
‐ When do you start?
‐ Sometime next week.

18:13.676 --> 18:16.409
They still have to call,
and make me a formal offer.

18:16.476 --> 18:19.476
Oh, then I guess this is what
this message is all about.

18:19.543 --> 18:22.143
Oh, they probably want me
to start tomorrow.

18:27.809 --> 18:30.409
Hello, Maxine Shaw
for Tom Pearlman, please.

18:33.009 --> 18:34.776
Mr. Pearlman, hi.

18:36.076 --> 18:38.676
I enjoyed our meeting
this afternoon, as well.

18:42.809 --> 18:44.843
Oh, I see.

18:44.909 --> 18:47.376
Thank you.

18:47.443 --> 18:49.909
‐ I didn't get the job.
‐ Oh!

18:49.976 --> 18:51.376
Why not?

18:51.443 --> 18:53.809
They went
with another candidate.

18:53.876 --> 18:55.909
Oh, maybe it's because
you're a woman.

18:55.976 --> 18:59.476
‐ Yeah.
‐ They hired a woman.

18:59.543 --> 19:01.716
Well, you know,
could be a racial thing.

19:01.783 --> 19:03.549
Yeah, that's it, racial.

19:03.616 --> 19:05.549
She was a sister.

19:07.416 --> 19:09.349
Anybody?

19:18.716 --> 19:21.616
I know what the problem is.
It's me.

19:21.683 --> 19:22.983
Max don't trip.

19:23.049 --> 19:24.716
No, no, maybe..

19:24.783 --> 19:28.149
Maybe I'm, uh,
not qualified enough.

19:28.216 --> 19:32.149
Come on, Max, now, I could say
a lot of bad things about you.

19:32.216 --> 19:34.783
And I will.

19:34.849 --> 19:37.149
But you are a good lawyer.

19:37.216 --> 19:39.583
You graduated at the top
of your class.

19:39.649 --> 19:42.183
You passed the New York bar
the first time.

19:42.249 --> 19:46.016
John F. Kennedy Jr. couldn't
do it, and he knows people.

19:47.949 --> 19:50.216
Well, maybe I just don't
work hard enough.

19:51.483 --> 19:54.183
Hush up, girl.
Nobody works harder.

19:55.616 --> 19:57.649
Or maybe
it's an ego thing.

19:57.716 --> 19:59.516
Maybe I'm too arrogant.

19:59.583 --> 20:00.589
No.

20:04.023 --> 20:05.589
Max, you are arrogant.

20:05.656 --> 20:09.123
And hard headed and overbearing
and domineering.

20:09.189 --> 20:12.423
But that's what it takes
to be a good attorney.

20:12.489 --> 20:15.223
‐ Maybe.
‐ Okay, my pep talk is done.

20:15.289 --> 20:17.856
If you need some more stroking,
talk to Synclaire.

20:17.923 --> 20:20.156
You'll be back to work
in no time.

20:20.223 --> 20:22.656
At even better firm,
making more money.

20:22.723 --> 20:25.223
Believe me, everything
happens for a reason.

20:25.289 --> 20:27.223
Woo woo woo.
Woo woo woo.

20:31.556 --> 20:32.923
Yeah, you're right.

20:32.989 --> 20:35.556
I'll be fine.
Fine, more than fine.

20:35.623 --> 20:38.389
‐ Ha, I just need food.
‐ There you go.

20:56.323 --> 20:58.523
Yes, hello.
May I speak to Al Evans

20:58.589 --> 21:00.529
or Raymond Bell, please?

21:02.829 --> 21:04.796
I know I may have
acted rashly, but..

21:04.863 --> 21:07.496
No, that's stupid.

21:07.563 --> 21:09.396
I know I may have
acted foolish..

21:09.463 --> 21:11.196
...but if you give me
another chance

21:11.263 --> 21:14.196
I think I can prove...
that I'm a team player.

21:16.229 --> 21:18.729
(woman on phone)
'Al Evans office.'

21:18.796 --> 21:20.896
'Hello?'

21:20.963 --> 21:23.096
