Coach Spitz?

00:12.380 --> 00:14.170
I don't know what "it do,"

00:14.170 --> 00:16.120
but you need to pay
more attention
in English class.

00:16.120 --> 00:19.210

00:19.210 --> 00:22.120
-(laughter)
-You see what I did there?

00:22.580 --> 00:24.750
Sadly, I did.

00:24.750 --> 00:25.880
It's for my new play.

00:25.880 --> 00:27.210
It's the story of
a boy whose dreams

00:27.210 --> 00:29.580
of becoming
a famous horse jockey
are dashed

00:29.580 --> 00:30.880

About you?

00:37.920 --> 00:40.710
Yep. It's full
of memorable moments,

00:40.710 --> 00:43.040
like when I stand in front
of the jockey committee and say,

00:43.040 --> 00:45.880
"I'm not too big.

00:46.670 --> 00:49.750
Those horses are too small!"

00:52.670 --> 00:54.290
Nope, they fired me.

00:54.290 --> 00:56.210
So, I took up basketball
and learned to rap.

00:56.210 --> 00:59.420

Oh, I know. Hey!
Speaking of the musical,

10:20.250 --> 10:22.000
you know, the school
called and asked

10:22.000 --> 10:23.750
if I would handle
refreshments at the show.

10:23.750 --> 10:25.250
-Really?
-Yeah.

10:25.250 --> 10:26.670
What you gonna serve?

10:28.000 --> 10:31.080
My turnip juice.
You know, the one you love.

10:31.080 --> 10:32.790
And in keeping with
the hip-hop theme,

10:32.790 --> 10:35.000
I'm calling it
"Turnip for What."

10:35.000 --> 10:35.960
No, you're not.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.040
-Hey, Aunt Chels. Hey, Mom.
-Hey, boo.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.500
So, I didn't take "no"
for an answer.

10:42.500 --> 10:46.120
Tess will be making
her acting debut
in Spitz! The Musical.

10:46.120 --> 10:48.620
-Atta girl!
-Hey, Levi. How was your day?

10:48.620 --> 10:51.620
-A lot better than his.
-Aw, sweetheart, what's wrong?

10:51.620 --> 10:54.080
-I didn't get the part.
-What? What?

10:54.080 --> 10:56.420
That's impossible! Who got it?

10:56.420 --> 10:57.830
Tess did...

10:58.380 --> 10:59.880
thanks to Nia.

10:59.880 --> 11:02.080
Why did you have
to push so hard
to get Tess to try out?

11:02.080 --> 11:06.460
I'm sorry, Booker,
but I was following
some pretty good advice.

11:06.460 --> 11:08.000
Whose advice was that?

11:10.460 --> 11:12.040
(stammering)
You want some pie?

11:12.880 --> 11:14.620
Really, Mom?

11:15.580 --> 11:17.540
I'm too upset to eat.

11:21.080 --> 11:24.790
Chels, did you hear that?
My baby's too upset to eat.

11:24.790 --> 11:27.330
Well, he did take a cookie.

11:27.330 --> 11:30.080
One cookie, Chels.

11:30.080 --> 11:33.080
(choking up)
My baby's broken.

11:34.420 --> 11:35.750
I don't know what
I'm gonna do.

11:35.750 --> 11:37.080
I mean, on one hand,

11:37.080 --> 11:39.460
I'm really, really happy
that Nia asserted herself.

11:39.460 --> 11:42.880
But on the other hand,
I wish it didn't have to be
at Booker's expense.

11:42.880 --> 11:44.710
So what're you gonna do?

11:45.920 --> 11:47.120
Well...

11:48.750 --> 11:50.460
I'm gonna do

I'm gonna go
