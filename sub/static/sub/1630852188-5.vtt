[birds squawk]

01:01.269 --> 01:03.480
We will make it home, Yaz.

01:05.023 --> 01:07.942
If you say it enough times,
it's gotta be true, right?

01:13.031 --> 01:14.866
[buzzes, thuds]

01:14.949 --> 01:16.367
The plane left without you?

01:17.452 --> 01:18.953
[Mae] I'm so sorry.

01:19.037 --> 01:21.247
I don't understand what's going on here,

01:21.331 --> 01:25.043
but you have my word
that I'll get you off this island somehow.

01:25.794 --> 01:28.254
No. We're not leaving.

01:28.338 --> 01:31.758
Obviously, this isn't what we wanted.
Like, at all.

01:32.342 --> 01:33.510
But we can't quit now.

01:33.593 --> 01:36.387
Mantah Corp doesn't care
if they're hurting their dinosaurs.

01:36.471 --> 01:39.432
And Mae, you can't protect them
all on your own.

01:39.516 --> 01:42.977
We have to stay until we fix this,
however long it takes.

01:47.315 --> 01:48.274
Sure.

01:49.901 --> 01:50.944
Whatever you say.

01:52.403 --> 01:53.571
Let's get to work, then.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.907
We've gotta get Pierce back
to the desert biome.

01:55.990 --> 01:57.492
And if the plane's gone,

01:57.575 --> 02:00.328
that means the new dinosaur food
has already been unloaded.

02:01.621 --> 02:05.458
We'll go check the T-Rex area to make sure
the BRADs haven't tainted their food.

02:05.542 --> 02:08.753
Y'all, Yaz and I are both wrecked,

02:08.837 --> 02:10.964
so we're gonna go get some rest,
if that's cool.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.967
-Of course.
-Yeah, don't worry about it.

02:14.050 --> 02:16.052
After you're all done, we'll meet at Mae's

02:16.136 --> 02:18.638
and figure out a game plan
to protect those dinos.

02:21.349 --> 02:22.350
Thanks for that.

I gave you guys military-grade

02:51.963 --> 02:52.922
[Kash] Uh-huh.

02:53.006 --> 02:56.509

a two-ton dinosaur?

02:56.593 --> 02:59.554
[BRAD 2] <i>Affirmative. Location unknown.</i>

02:59.637 --> 03:00.597
[Kash] Okay, then.

03:00.680 --> 03:04.767
Can you at least tell me
if the missing BRAD fell through the ice

03:04.851 --> 03:06.477
and is down there somewhere?

That's right, darling. Home.

She…

04:16.464 --> 04:18.258
She just talked to a dinosaur.

04:18.758 --> 04:21.636
Pfft.
She did it with fancy science buttons.

04:21.719 --> 04:24.264
Bumpy and I found a way
to talk through here.

People always say to clear your mind,

04:45.743 --> 04:49.580
but I like to think of all the things
that make me feel warm and gooey.

04:49.664 --> 04:51.624
What if I've forgotten that, too?

04:52.250 --> 04:54.877
Think about home. What you miss.

04:56.421 --> 05:00.133
I'll start. I miss strong showers.

I guess hiding my personal side project
from you all isn't necessary anymore.

before I shared it with Mantah Corp.

Yeah. I'd follow that instinct.

never went to help her.

11:14.632 --> 11:16.300
How could your orders be overridden?

11:16.384 --> 11:18.969
I thought there was no communication
on or off the island.

11:19.053 --> 11:23.099
There isn't. Someone must be here
giving counter orders.

11:24.975 --> 11:27.603
-Who's Kash?
-My boss.

11:28.312 --> 11:30.898
Right, then. You get Pierce to his food.

11:30.981 --> 11:32.775

I'll get cleaned up,
then go get some answers.

11:36.487 --> 11:37.905
You sure that's safe?

11:37.988 --> 11:39.698
Kash is a harmless blowhard

11:39.782 --> 11:42.618
with a penchant for bad music
and even worse tattoos.

11:42.701 --> 11:44.954
Plus, until I know what he's up to,

11:45.037 --> 11:46.872
it's best he doesn't know you're here.

12:53.939 --> 12:57.401
All we do is wait. I'm tired of it.

12:58.486 --> 13:00.404
Well, Mae said we should stay put.

15:36.810 --> 15:38.896
Let's just dialogue for a sec.

You have no intention of making
this island a research facility, do you?

15:43.150 --> 15:46.570
Let's just say
that Mantah Corp's plans here are fluid.
