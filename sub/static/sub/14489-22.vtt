12:44.223 --> 12:45.933
I miss Leela so much.

12:46.016 --> 12:49.770
Last night in the bathtub, I ate
a whole box of taco shells.

12:49.853 --> 12:51.855
Yes, I was there.

12:51.939 --> 12:55.276
I know she said not to contact
her, but it's been three weeks.

12:55.359 --> 12:58.153
I'm going to fall down that
manhole again and visit her.

12:58.237 --> 12:59.280
(BEEPING)

12:59.363 --> 13:01.740
Leela's wrist thingy.
How can I help you?

13:01.824 --> 13:03.325
<i>Fry, where's Leela?</i>

13:03.409 --> 13:05.577
<i>We haven't seen her since
she sprouted tentacles.</i>

13:05.786 --> 13:08.455
What? She didn't move down there?
Then where is she?

13:08.539 --> 13:10.374
<i>That's what I
called to ask you.</i>

13:10.457 --> 13:11.917
Well, you didn't!

13:14.712 --> 13:16.964
I've got to figure out
where Leela went.

13:17.047 --> 13:18.841
I just need
some kind of clue.

13:18.966 --> 13:19.967
Ow!

13:20.050 --> 13:22.803
(GASPS) Leela's boot.
Where did it come from?

13:22.886 --> 13:26.015
I think it fell from the
sky, but I'm not sure.

13:26.598 --> 13:27.725
Now I'm sure.

13:27.975 --> 13:30.185

13:41.739 --> 13:45.659
Remember that mural on my cousin's van?
It's like it came to life!

13:45.743 --> 13:48.579
I keep telling you,
we didn't grow up together.

13:48.662 --> 13:50.497
LEELA: Help, help!

13:50.581 --> 13:54.251
Oh! Leela, don't worry,
we're here to rescue you!

13:54.335 --> 13:55.753
How do we get up there?

13:55.836 --> 13:58.547
I'll let my hair down
and you can climb up!

14:01.467 --> 14:02.718
That's not hair.

14:02.801 --> 14:05.554
I don't care what it is.
I just like climbing.

14:09.016 --> 14:11.101
(GASPING)
Holy Rapunzel, man-bat!

14:11.185 --> 14:13.187
There's a duo here
to rescue us!

14:13.437 --> 14:14.688
How dynamic are they?

14:14.897 --> 14:16.023
Not very.

14:16.106 --> 14:18.942
Go about your business,
citizens.

14:19.276 --> 14:20.861
Well, back to being
the subject

14:20.944 --> 14:23.947

experiments, old chum.

Oh, Leela, it's so great to see
your beautiful face again.

14:37.711 --> 14:39.046
Let me give you a hug.

14:39.213 --> 14:43.384
Uh, okay. Go in that corner.
It's the hugging corner.

14:43.675 --> 14:45.302
You, too, Bender.

14:47.179 --> 14:49.473
Instead, I went to bed
because I'm tired now.

14:49.556 --> 14:52.309
This is about your
tentacles, isn't it?

14:52.393 --> 14:54.061
Look, Leela,
there's nothing about

14:54.144 --> 14:56.480
your body that could
ever shock me, so...

14:57.064 --> 14:58.357
(SCREAMS)

14:59.149 --> 15:00.818
That is nasty!

15:07.199 --> 15:08.909
Sorry I screamed, Leela.

15:08.992 --> 15:11.620
I was just so
excited to see you.

15:11.703 --> 15:13.789
Yeah. Let's just
get out of here.

15:13.872 --> 15:16.208
No problem.
I'll bend the door open.

15:16.291 --> 15:18.168
You can't bend
a wooden door!

15:18.252 --> 15:19.837
I know that,
and you know that.

15:20.003 --> 15:21.588

looks pretty stupid.

Poor thing.
We've got to help him.

to escape, but whatever.

No!

help you commit
