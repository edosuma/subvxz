in there.

13:16.396 --> 13:18.763
Get your ass out here,
right now.

13:18.832 --> 13:21.366
- Look who decided to show

13:21.501 --> 13:24.302
her face. Thought you were
too good for us.

13:24.304 --> 13:27.038
- You did this, didn't you?
- I don't know what you're
talking about, cous'.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.773
- I'm Kodie's lawyer.
Time to go.

13:28.908 --> 13:30.975
- You couldn't get Maddie
to be your down girl

13:31.011 --> 13:33.778
so you called me in.
You called MFS.

13:33.913 --> 13:36.247
- Nah. You'll drive
that girl away

13:36.249 --> 13:38.249
all on your own.
We're still family.

13:43.190 --> 13:45.122
- I remember you,
skinny-ass bitch.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.258
You the one T.K.O.'d this town,

13:47.260 --> 13:49.460
the one whose daddy couldn't
keep his hands off

13:49.462 --> 13:51.129
all those little girls.

13:51.264 --> 13:53.998
- Joanna!
- Stay away from my client

13:54.133 --> 13:57.068
and her children...
or you will regret it.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.010
- Thought you said we had
to keep it cool?

14:06.046 --> 14:08.046
- That was cool.

14:18.057 --> 14:20.558
- Whatcha' doing?
- Ah, I came home for lunch.

14:20.560 --> 14:24.428
- A lunch that includes
throwing tomahawks at a target?

her kids go missing?

14:35.475 --> 14:38.042

14:38.111 --> 14:40.111
Sam Mercer has something
to do with the apprehension?

14:40.113 --> 14:42.513
- He blames me
for ruining his life.

14:42.515 --> 14:44.582
He'd try to do anything
to ruin mine.

She's not exactly family.

Everything is my business.

your kids back,

17:48.101 --> 17:50.034

Kodie.

You know how hard it is
to get out from under your past.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
- Maddie hid
her involvement from me,

18:23.069 --> 18:24.935
knew I'd go through the roof.

18:24.971 --> 18:28.940

she called MFS as payback.

good explanation.

- There were drugs
in the house, Joanna.

22:27.579 --> 22:29.513
- Exactly! If she was using,
she wouldn't have drugs

22:29.582 --> 22:31.782
lying around, she would have
licked that baggie clean.

22:31.818 --> 22:34.017

forgot where she put 'em.

22:34.087 --> 22:36.787
- No active addict forgets
where their stash is hidden.

22:36.823 --> 22:38.856
- She's got a point, Billy.

22:38.858 --> 22:41.125
- In fact, the presence
of drugs further proves

22:41.127 --> 22:43.527
that she isn't using and that
someone is setting her up.

22:43.529 --> 22:45.363

there, Counsellor.

22:45.498 --> 22:48.098

it's Occam's razor.
- I'm saying the evidence

22:48.101 --> 22:50.066

- You're bringing your bias

22:50.103 --> 22:52.002

- Oh, why? Because I know

22:52.071 --> 22:54.338

- All Madison's said

22:54.473 --> 22:56.474
was what a great mom
Kodie's been.

22:56.609 --> 22:59.810
She has changed, Billy.

22:59.812 --> 23:02.546

find better ways to lie.

23:02.548 --> 23:05.215

23:08.287 --> 23:10.254
Hi.

23:18.831 --> 23:21.164

23:27.639 --> 23:30.107
- Nothing bonds you more
than being other.

23:30.176 --> 23:34.178
Why are you so convinced
she's guilty?

23:34.313 --> 23:36.113
- Because that's
where the evidence points.

23:38.651 --> 23:41.385
- Joanna is a great lawyer,

23:41.520 --> 23:44.121
and in her own totally
antisocial way,

23:44.256 --> 23:46.122
a good judge of character, too.

23:46.159 --> 23:49.026
- She's got tunnel vision
on this one.

23:53.199 --> 23:56.200

Tell her.

24:11.884 --> 24:13.951
- Kodie confirmed my theory,

24:13.953 --> 24:15.886
she has no idea
where those drugs came from.

24:15.922 --> 24:17.821
- Excuse me.

24:17.857 --> 24:19.823
- Someone planted them, Billy.

24:19.826 --> 24:22.826
- What else is she gonna say?
- You're saying that
she's lying.

24:22.961 --> 24:25.062
- No, I'm not!

24:27.099 --> 24:29.700
I don't know.

24:29.835 --> 24:32.770
Honestly, I don't know.

24:36.042 --> 24:37.942
Since we've been back here...

24:39.879 --> 24:41.779

Look, we both have ghosts

a chance to prepare my cross.

26:59.051 --> 27:01.251
- Which she hates.

27:01.387 --> 27:02.986
This is where you two
fine young people come in.

27:03.022 --> 27:05.389
- [When they call a witness,
Billy will text you their name.]

27:05.524 --> 27:07.291
- But isn't it illegal
to use a phone in court?

27:07.426 --> 27:10.360
- Only if you get caught.
- [Deep-dive the name]

27:10.363 --> 27:12.129
and dig up any dirt
you can find.

27:12.264 --> 27:14.064
Text me keywords that I can use.

27:14.199 --> 27:16.266
- Copy that.
- [Great.]

27:16.401 --> 27:18.702
Put on your fatigues, ladies.
It's time to do battle.

27:21.574 --> 27:23.474
- (man):<i> We have</i>
<i> before the court</i>

27:23.609 --> 27:25.475
<i> a care and custody hearing.</i>

27:25.511 --> 27:27.678
- On the night of July 21st,

27:27.813 --> 27:30.948
Mashkode Chartrand's
two children, Madison, 12,

27:31.083 --> 27:34.017
who is present in court today,
and Tru, 7,

27:34.152 --> 27:36.487
were apprehended from her home
after receiving a complaint

27:36.489 --> 27:38.689
of neglect and abuse.

27:38.691 --> 27:41.892
Millwood Family Services
seek custody of the children.

27:42.027 --> 27:44.695
- Your Honour, my client
has been clean and sober
for 18 months.

27:44.697 --> 27:46.629
She has fully cooperated
with this investigation.

27:46.666 --> 27:50.701
- You'll get
your turn, Ms. Chang.
Your first witness, Ms. Cohen?

27:50.703 --> 27:53.137
- We call Natalie Cross,
Your Honour.

27:56.676 --> 27:58.575
(ding)

27:58.577 --> 28:01.912
(tense music)

28:01.914 --> 28:03.781
- Natalie Cross.

28:15.761 --> 28:17.728
- Ms. Cross,

28:17.730 --> 28:20.396
you are Madison Chartrand's
seventh grade teacher?

28:20.433 --> 28:22.332
- Yes, ma'am.
- And how many days

28:22.467 --> 28:24.334
of school did she miss
last month?

28:24.370 --> 28:27.871
- Oh jeez,
I wouldn't know offhand.

28:27.907 --> 28:31.041
- I do. 15.

28:31.176 --> 28:34.011
That surprise you?
- Not really.

28:34.146 --> 28:36.346
Madison was away a lot.

28:36.382 --> 28:39.817
- And what state was Madison in
when she was in class?

28:39.819 --> 28:41.752
- Depends on the day, I guess.

28:41.887 --> 28:44.954
- Did she ever show up hungry?
- Yes.

28:44.990 --> 28:47.557
- Tired?
- Most days.

28:47.593 --> 28:51.295
- And what about with bruises
on her body?

28:51.297 --> 28:54.298
- A week ago. I reported it

28:54.300 --> 28:56.633
to the principal.
- And what did you report?

28:56.635 --> 28:59.036
- I suspected Madison
was being abused.

29:04.443 --> 29:07.110
- Her saccharine Facebook posts
make me want to puke,

29:07.113 --> 29:08.978
but I'm not sure
if that's actionable.

29:09.014 --> 29:11.815
- Anyone who does a Spartan race
should get arrested

29:11.884 --> 29:14.918
just for that.
(Cat laughs)

29:14.920 --> 29:17.120
- Your roommate?
- No.

29:17.189 --> 29:19.056
I haven't heard from her yet.

29:24.230 --> 29:26.129
- Oh my God.

29:26.264 --> 29:28.932
- What?
- Jackpot.

29:29.067 --> 29:31.068
Come check this out.

29:33.172 --> 29:35.939
- Oh, uh... Is that our teacher?

29:36.074 --> 29:39.276
- Turns out our Miss Frizzle
moonlights as a lingerie model.

29:39.411 --> 29:41.545
- Wait, you're gonna use that?

29:41.547 --> 29:44.047
- Are you kidding me?
This is a goldmine for Joanna.

29:44.049 --> 29:46.316
- But that's just another form
of slut-shaming.

29:46.451 --> 29:49.019
- Which, in theory,
I am totally not for,

29:49.088 --> 29:50.888
but this isn't
a university campus, Luna.

29:51.023 --> 29:54.357
This is a law firm. Political
correctness goes out the window

29:54.393 --> 29:56.560
when you're trying to win.
- Thank you, Ms. Cross.

29:56.695 --> 29:58.662
We have no further questions,
Your Honour.

29:58.664 --> 30:01.598
- Ms. Chang, your witness.

30:03.435 --> 30:05.435
Ms. Chang.

30:05.437 --> 30:08.906
- Ms. Cross, how many days
were you absent last semester?

30:09.041 --> 30:11.375
- Sorry?
- Well, we just spoke

30:11.510 --> 30:13.644
about Madison's absenteeism,
what about yours?

30:13.779 --> 30:17.581
- I missed a few days.
I have a fairly full life.

30:17.583 --> 30:20.650
- Does this full life
include a second job?

30:20.686 --> 30:22.785
- I'm not sure
what you're asking.

30:22.822 --> 30:24.854
- I think I was fairly clear
but I can reframe:

30:24.890 --> 30:28.692
do you have another source
of income, besides teaching?

30:28.694 --> 30:32.195
- I do some modelling.

30:32.198 --> 30:35.465
- Is that what you call this?
- Objection.

30:35.600 --> 30:38.134
- I don't think people would
object if they saw these.

30:38.170 --> 30:41.939
- Ms. Chang, put the phone away.
- Your Honour, the witness has
accused my client of abuse.

30:42.074 --> 30:45.875
These photos should at least
show that she has

30:45.911 --> 30:50.480
questionable judgement.
- You're on thin ice, Ms. Chang.

30:50.482 --> 30:54.217
- Who is that?
- Ryan's mother.

30:54.253 --> 30:56.286
- Your Honour, an interested
third party would like

30:56.421 --> 30:58.355
to be introduced to the court.

30:58.357 --> 31:01.224
- What's your name, ma'am?
- Marlene Laudington.

31:01.293 --> 31:03.293
- Your relationship
to these children?

31:03.362 --> 31:06.496
- I'm Tru's biological
grandmother and I would like

31:06.632 --> 31:09.967
to petition for full custody
of both children.

31:09.969 --> 31:12.102
- Your Honour,
we request a recess.

31:12.237 --> 31:16.006
- Granted. Let's all take 15.

31:18.410 --> 31:20.978
- I've barely met the woman,
now she wants to take my babies?

31:21.113 --> 31:23.046
- We have 15 minutes.

31:23.181 --> 31:26.116
Tell me everything
you know about Grandma.

31:32.190 --> 31:34.124
- I'm retired,
but I was an accountant.

31:34.126 --> 31:37.661
- And your financial situation?
- Very secure.

31:37.796 --> 31:39.730
I'm happy to provide the court

31:39.732 --> 31:41.464
with any
of my financial statements.

31:41.500 --> 31:44.334
- And what is your interest
in these two children?

31:44.469 --> 31:48.538
- I want to provide them
with a loving,

31:48.674 --> 31:51.074
stable environment
so that they can blossom.

31:51.209 --> 31:53.343
- Like Ryan blossomed?

31:53.379 --> 31:55.812
- Ms. Chang,
control your client.

31:55.881 --> 31:58.482
- Who is Ryan, Ms. Laudington?

31:58.617 --> 32:00.416
- My son.

32:00.452 --> 32:03.353
Tru's father.
- And what happened to him?

32:03.355 --> 32:07.758
- He died a year and a half ago,

32:07.893 --> 32:10.494
of a drug overdose.

32:10.629 --> 32:12.762
She's the reason he's gone.

32:12.897 --> 32:15.832
- No more questions,
Your Honour.

32:15.968 --> 32:19.236
- Do you need a moment,
Ms. Laudington?

32:23.642 --> 32:26.977
After your divorce, when your
son was still a teenager,

32:27.112 --> 32:29.713
how often was he supervised?
- He went to the best school

32:29.715 --> 32:32.248
in Winnipeg,
stood top of his class.

32:32.284 --> 32:35.118
- Well, and he achieved that
with the help of amphetamines,

32:35.120 --> 32:37.788
right under your roof?
- This is all conjecture,

32:37.923 --> 32:41.858
Your Honour. Ryan Laudington
can't testify to this.

32:41.860 --> 32:45.061
- But isn't it true
that you didn't have contact

32:45.097 --> 32:47.130
with your son for several years
before his death?

32:47.132 --> 32:49.633
- After he met her.

32:49.768 --> 32:52.202
She pulled him away from me.

32:52.204 --> 32:56.406
- In 2006, you were charged

32:56.541 --> 32:58.141
with driving
under the influence.

32:58.276 --> 33:00.477
- That was a one-time thing.

33:00.612 --> 33:02.879
- Oh, so you don't
drink anymore.

33:02.881 --> 33:05.281
- Just socially.

33:05.317 --> 33:07.884
- Right.

33:07.886 --> 33:11.288
So... how often
do you socialize?

33:11.423 --> 33:14.057
Three times a week, every day?
- She's a drunk.

33:14.093 --> 33:17.427
- Ms. Chang, if your client
can't contain herself,
she'll be removed.

33:17.562 --> 33:19.896
- Ryan found her passed out
in the bathtub!

33:19.932 --> 33:22.632
- You let my son die!
- I'm clean.

33:22.768 --> 33:25.235
- Prove it.
- Can you say the same?

33:25.237 --> 33:27.937
- Don't respond.
- Ms. Chang, Ms. Cohen.

33:28.073 --> 33:31.141
I'm ordering you both
to take a drug and alcohol test.

33:34.112 --> 33:36.646
- Happy to. Happy to prove it.

33:36.682 --> 33:39.249
- We'll adjourn, until results
return from the lab.

33:39.384 --> 33:41.385
(tense music)

33:49.628 --> 33:51.527
- Hot date?

33:51.563 --> 33:54.731
- Um, I really need
to find my friend.

33:54.733 --> 33:56.866
- Longstanding legal tradition,

33:56.902 --> 33:58.935
after a day in court: scotch.

33:58.937 --> 34:01.404
- Are you serious?

34:01.407 --> 34:03.607
- It's tradition.

34:03.609 --> 34:05.675
Billy keeps a secret stash
in his filing cabinet,

34:05.677 --> 34:07.677
but it's locked.

34:10.249 --> 34:12.682
- Combo's 1-2-3.
- Yes!

34:15.454 --> 34:18.221
- Just the one, OK?

34:18.223 --> 34:21.157
I really do need
to track down Taylor.

34:21.193 --> 34:23.159
- My roommates could be
gone for weeks

34:23.295 --> 34:25.628
and I wouldn't even notice.
You guys seem tight.

34:25.664 --> 34:29.031
- Yeah, she's like
the sister I never had.

34:29.068 --> 34:31.234
- Here's the scotch.

34:31.270 --> 34:33.703
- But don't tell Joanna.

34:33.739 --> 34:36.239
- Screwed-up families, huh?

34:36.241 --> 34:38.842
- Everyone's got one.

34:38.844 --> 34:41.444
- Yeah. You hide it well,

34:41.447 --> 34:43.980
but you don't have to.

34:45.984 --> 34:49.119
- Uh, we need glasses.

34:53.658 --> 34:55.725
- We haven't even had a chance
to argue our case

34:55.861 --> 34:57.661
and now Kodie has talked
herself into a drug test.

34:57.663 --> 35:01.398
- She more than talked
herself into it.

35:01.533 --> 35:03.600
It's out of our hands now.

35:03.735 --> 35:06.536
- I just want--
- I know.

35:06.671 --> 35:08.472
You owe her one.

35:12.644 --> 35:16.212
- So, where did Kodie go
after the test?

35:16.281 --> 35:19.482
- I offered to keep her company
but she wanted to be on her own.

35:19.485 --> 35:22.085
- It's times like these, family
and land are the only comfort.

35:22.220 --> 35:24.954
- She's probably at
the old Chartrand Fishing Lodge.

35:25.089 --> 35:28.024
- Hub of criminal activity
Mercer never did a thing about.

35:28.060 --> 35:31.361
- Let's not talk about
the law tonight, babe.
- That was creepy though,

35:31.363 --> 35:34.097
the other day, when Mercer asked
us for forgiveness.

35:34.099 --> 35:36.632
- Wait, you did talk to him?

35:36.668 --> 35:40.036
(sighing)
- I was going to tell you.

35:40.072 --> 35:41.671
(phone ringing)

35:44.009 --> 35:48.178
- Hello? Results are in.

35:48.180 --> 35:51.014
Judge wants us back in chambers.

36:00.392 --> 36:03.459
- The results
of both tests are back.

36:03.595 --> 36:06.596
Ms. Laudington,

36:06.731 --> 36:08.531
you tested negative
for drugs and alcohol.

36:08.666 --> 36:11.334
Ms. Chartrand,

36:11.469 --> 36:14.137
you tested positive for cocaine.

36:14.206 --> 36:16.272
- (softly): No,
that's not possible.

36:16.341 --> 36:18.341
- And it is the decision
of this court

36:18.343 --> 36:20.210
that both your children
be placed in the custody

36:20.212 --> 36:22.212
of Ms. Laudington.

36:24.549 --> 36:26.483
- (Kodie): No!

36:26.618 --> 36:30.553
Joanna, don't let them!
No, please! Maddie!

36:30.589 --> 36:32.689
Maddie!

36:32.691 --> 36:34.691
(mournful Indigenous music)

36:34.693 --> 36:37.494
(inaudible speaking)

36:40.532 --> 36:43.500
(vocalists harmonizing)

37:02.120 --> 37:04.321
- (Catherine): I can't
believe we lost.

37:04.323 --> 37:07.123
- And I can't believe
you drink this stuff for fun.

37:07.159 --> 37:10.594
- It's so smoky, it's like
your mouth is on fire.

37:13.732 --> 37:15.998
Today, at the warehouse, Aki?

37:16.034 --> 37:17.933
That was personal for you.

37:17.970 --> 37:20.003
- Disappointed...

37:20.005 --> 37:22.271
I'm not a robot like Joanna?

37:22.307 --> 37:24.540
- She's not a robot,

37:24.610 --> 37:26.942
she's just a master
at compartmentalization

37:26.979 --> 37:30.680
and only the progeny
of a true bastard can do that.

37:30.682 --> 37:33.950
- And we do share a parent.
- Right.

37:33.952 --> 37:37.854
- Yeah, not according to him.

37:39.891 --> 37:42.625
You know I spent 18 years
wondering about him.

37:42.661 --> 37:45.362
I'd search the faces
of other white men,

37:45.497 --> 37:48.498
wondering... are you my dad?

37:48.633 --> 37:51.301
- I'm sorry.

37:51.436 --> 37:54.236
- He denied me
until the day he died,

37:54.273 --> 37:57.307
and when your dad won't
acknowledge you--

37:57.309 --> 38:00.310
- He's not-- he's not your dad.

38:00.379 --> 38:04.514
He's a sperm donor,
sure, but a dad?

38:04.516 --> 38:06.383
That's bedtime stories,

38:06.518 --> 38:08.852
that's coming home from work
because you're sick.

38:08.987 --> 38:10.920
- Sounds like you had
a good one.

38:11.056 --> 38:14.791
- I drove him crazy,
but he showed up for me.

38:14.860 --> 38:16.793
He was an everyday player.

38:16.795 --> 38:18.828
- I never had that.

38:20.865 --> 38:22.832
- Maybe he didn't deserve you.

38:24.870 --> 38:27.537
You're smart, you're driven,

38:27.672 --> 38:30.607
you even have a sense of humour
after some scotch.

38:32.644 --> 38:34.544
And you did that

38:34.546 --> 38:37.047
not just because you didn't have
a dad, but in spite of one.

38:43.388 --> 38:45.355
- I should go.

38:45.424 --> 38:49.059
- Right, the case
of the missing roommate.

38:51.063 --> 38:53.429
Good work today, rookie.

38:53.565 --> 38:55.498
- Can you not call me that?

38:55.534 --> 38:58.134
- Bring me coffee tomorrow
and I'll think about it.
