00:01.987 --> 00:03.754
The muggings were
confined to Cabot Street.

00:03.755 --> 00:04.989
They began over
two months ago...

00:04.990 --> 00:06.290
Just like this briefing did.

00:06.291 --> 00:07.992
Please go to charisma class.

00:07.993 --> 00:09.560
I'm here. I'm here.
Sorry, Charles.

00:09.561 --> 00:10.828
(Charles) No, Jake.

00:10.829 --> 00:12.963
Never apologize for
making an amazing entrance.

00:12.964 --> 00:14.098
My power went out last night,

00:14.099 --> 00:15.232
and my alarm didn't go off.

00:15.233 --> 00:17.334
Your alarm is power-dependent?

00:17.335 --> 00:18.869
You brought this
on yourself, son.

00:18.870 --> 00:20.738
The point is,
it will not happen again.

00:20.739 --> 00:22.506
Carry on.

00:22.507 --> 00:23.507
Sorry I'm late, Sarge.

00:23.508 --> 00:24.541
No hot water this morning.

00:24.576 --> 00:27.278
But I'm here, ready to go.

00:27.279 --> 00:28.978
Will cause no
further distractions.

00:30.015 --> 00:31.649
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Seriously?

00:31.650 --> 00:33.084
What is your excuse today?

00:33.085 --> 00:34.085
More bad luck.

00:34.086 --> 00:35.286
My car ran out of gas,

00:35.287 --> 00:37.421
and then my clothes
disappeared from the Laundromat.

00:37.422 --> 00:39.457
I had to beg one of my neighbors
to loan me some of his.

00:39.458 --> 00:41.358
You never told us Sinbad
lives in your building.

00:41.359 --> 00:42.560
If Sinbad lived in my building,

00:42.561 --> 00:43.727
I would have a tattoo
on my forehead

00:43.728 --> 00:45.328
that said "Sinbad
lives in my building."

00:46.364 --> 00:48.265
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here,

00:48.266 --> 00:50.067
and I'm a half an hour early.

00:50.068 --> 00:53.204
That's right, my string of bad
luck has finally come to an end.

00:53.205 --> 00:54.905
Peralta, you failed
your drug test.

00:54.906 --> 00:57.074
There were traces
of cocaine and methamphetamines

00:57.075 --> 00:58.885
- found in your urine.
- What?

♪ ♪

01:18.930 --> 01:21.065
(Jake) Captain, this is insane.

01:21.066 --> 01:22.266
I don't do drugs.

01:22.267 --> 01:23.968
I mean, sure, a couple
of my teeth are loose,

01:23.969 --> 01:26.070
but that's from dental neglect,
not meth.

01:26.071 --> 01:27.471
Yeah, those tests
are unreliable.

01:27.472 --> 01:29.273
Okay, let's not blame "tests."

01:29.274 --> 01:30.341
I believe in you, Jake,

01:30.342 --> 01:32.143
but come on,
he's going after tests.

01:32.144 --> 01:33.144
Sir, listen:

01:33.145 --> 01:34.912
the missing laundry,
the hot water,

01:34.913 --> 01:35.912
the power, the gas,

01:35.947 --> 01:36.981
now this?

01:36.982 --> 01:38.649
This is not bad luck,
it's a pattern.

01:38.650 --> 01:40.251
Someone's trying to sabotage me.

01:40.252 --> 01:41.384
And who would want to do that?

01:41.419 --> 01:42.520
Probably someone I put away.

01:42.521 --> 01:43.587
It's the only explanation.

01:43.588 --> 01:44.922
Or you didn't pay your bills

01:44.923 --> 01:46.490
and you only put a quarter
gallon of gas in your tank

01:46.491 --> 01:48.325
'cause you wanted to spend the
rest on mini-mart beef jerky.

01:48.326 --> 01:49.827
Wrong, I buy my jerky online

01:49.828 --> 01:51.362
from the world's
top jerkmasters,

01:51.363 --> 01:53.497
so it looks like you need
to update your jerk Rolodex,

01:53.498 --> 01:55.166
which is not as dirty
as it sounds.

01:55.167 --> 01:57.768
Anyway, I can prove that I
filled up my tank, all right?

01:57.769 --> 01:58.936
I even have a receipt,

01:58.937 --> 02:01.872
because I keep all my receipts

02:01.873 --> 02:03.607
like a mature adult person.

02:03.608 --> 02:05.009
Laser tag,

02:05.010 --> 02:06.510
wheelie shoes,

02:06.511 --> 02:08.711
remote control monster truck,

02:08.713 --> 02:09.713
aha!

02:09.714 --> 02:10.714
Gas station.

02:10.715 --> 02:11.714
Someone drained my tank.

02:11.750 --> 02:13.117
Okay, I know you don't do drugs,

02:13.118 --> 02:15.119
so maybe there is something
to what you're saying.

02:15.120 --> 02:17.321
I'll talk to One Police Plaza
and arrange an appeal.

02:17.322 --> 02:20.089
I'll also put someone
on this sabotage theory.

02:20.125 --> 02:21.225
I got it.

02:21.226 --> 02:22.626
Jake, when I find
whoever did this to you,

02:22.627 --> 02:24.695
I'm gonna rip out their eyeballs
and fill their sockets...

02:24.696 --> 02:26.163
I think you might be
too close to this.

02:26.164 --> 02:27.164
Copy that.

02:27.165 --> 02:28.865
Santiago, Diaz: look into it.

02:28.900 --> 02:30.167
Noice.

02:30.168 --> 02:31.635
In the meantime, Peralta,
you're suspended.

02:31.636 --> 02:33.069
I'm gonna need you to hand in
your badge and gun.

02:33.104 --> 02:34.572
All right, fine,
you can have my badge and gun,

02:34.573 --> 02:35.806
but we're doing it
in your office

02:35.807 --> 02:37.141
so I can slam them
down on your desk

02:37.142 --> 02:38.509
and yell out,
"The system stinks!"

02:38.510 --> 02:40.377
Actually, the procedure is
to bring your gun and badge

02:40.378 --> 02:41.979
down to the equipment room
on the second floor,

02:41.980 --> 02:44.348
fill out form 452-underscore-J,

02:44.349 --> 02:46.383
hand said form in
to the inventory clerk,

02:46.384 --> 02:48.986
and then receive a claim check
through interoffice mail.

02:48.987 --> 02:50.754
The system stinks!

02:50.755 --> 02:52.056
(Terry) Hey, Boyle,

02:52.057 --> 02:53.691
any progress with
that extortion case

02:53.692 --> 02:55.059
you and Jake
have been working on?

02:55.060 --> 02:57.494
No, I've just been
going over his notes.

02:57.495 --> 03:00.164
Look how cool and illegible
his handwriting is.

03:00.165 --> 03:01.966
Oh, I wish I could be that free.

03:01.967 --> 03:03.767
But you know me,
ever the calligrapher.

03:03.768 --> 03:07.404
Yeah, well, I thought you might
need a little more manpower.

03:07.405 --> 03:08.405
Okay.

03:08.406 --> 03:10.107
So I'm assigning you
a new partner.

03:10.108 --> 03:12.643
Actually, partners.

03:12.644 --> 03:14.878
Yep, there's definitely
something in there.

03:14.879 --> 03:15.912
Looks like a peanut.

03:15.947 --> 03:17.648
Bet it's a cashew.

03:17.649 --> 03:18.649
You're on.

03:18.650 --> 03:20.484
No, Sarge, come on!

03:20.485 --> 03:21.619
They're terrible.

03:21.620 --> 03:23.220
Stop exaggerating, Boyle.

03:23.221 --> 03:25.155
They're good detectives.

03:25.156 --> 03:26.156
They're fine.

03:26.157 --> 03:27.157
(Scully) Oh, no.

03:27.158 --> 03:28.224
I pushed it in deeper.

03:29.761 --> 03:30.995
They're all we got.

03:30.996 --> 03:32.763
(Terry) Sir,

03:32.764 --> 03:35.299
Gina's dance concert
was last night.

03:35.300 --> 03:37.001
Right.

03:37.002 --> 03:39.069
The Dancy Reagan performance.

03:39.070 --> 03:41.105
I've been so preoccupied
with Peralta's drug test,

03:41.106 --> 03:42.239
it totally slipped my mind.

03:42.240 --> 03:43.440
Me too.

03:43.441 --> 03:44.942
But don't worry.

03:44.943 --> 03:46.076
I told her we were there.

03:46.077 --> 03:48.479
Was your favorite move
"The Gull"?

03:48.480 --> 03:50.214
Or was it "Space Bubbles"?

03:50.215 --> 03:52.016
Oh, I loved them both!

03:52.017 --> 03:54.151
I'm a bubble man

03:54.152 --> 03:55.385
and a gull man!

03:55.420 --> 03:56.954
[both laughing]

03:56.955 --> 03:57.955
You lied to her?

03:57.956 --> 03:58.956
Like a pro.

03:58.957 --> 04:00.257
I couldn't hurt her feelings.

04:00.258 --> 04:01.925
She really wanted
us to be there.

04:01.926 --> 04:04.795
Well, I wish you hadn't
involved me in your deception.

04:04.796 --> 04:08.065
I maintain a strict
code of integrity.

04:08.066 --> 04:09.433
Come on, Captain.

04:09.434 --> 04:11.801
You never told a white lie
to make a person feel better?

04:11.836 --> 04:15.272
I only lie when someone's
safety is at risk.

04:15.273 --> 04:17.241
Or if a juvenile aged
eight years or younger

04:17.242 --> 04:18.742
asks about Santa Claus.

04:18.743 --> 04:19.742
In which case...

04:19.778 --> 04:21.612
I feed them some reassuring pap

04:21.613 --> 04:24.381
about the logical impossibility
of proving a negative.

04:24.382 --> 04:26.216
It's sentimental drivel,

04:26.217 --> 04:27.851
but they eat it up.

04:27.852 --> 04:30.054
So...

04:30.055 --> 04:33.157
does this mean you're
gonna blow up my spot

04:33.158 --> 04:34.525
and tell Gina the truth?

04:34.526 --> 04:36.460
If she asks me, then yes,

04:36.461 --> 04:40.463
I suppose I will have to
blow your spot right up.

04:41.911 --> 04:43.667
(Jake) Okay, this is
everyone I could think of

04:43.668 --> 04:44.935
who would want to
mess with my life.

04:44.936 --> 04:46.337
Perps,
people I've testified against,

04:46.338 --> 04:47.538
the old guy
who lived underneath me

04:47.539 --> 04:49.106
when I was learning
the Gangnam Style dance.

04:49.107 --> 04:50.641
Wow, you've pissed off
a lot of people.

04:50.642 --> 04:53.076
Well, that's what happens
when you live out loud, Rosa.

04:53.111 --> 04:55.479
We need to look into
the power outage and hot water.

04:55.480 --> 04:56.914
Do you have proof
you pay your bills?

04:56.915 --> 04:58.015
Are you serious?

04:58.016 --> 04:59.917
Guys, this is not my fault.

04:59.918 --> 05:01.685
My reputation is being sabotaged

05:01.686 --> 05:02.953
by some guy.

05:02.954 --> 05:03.954
Or girl, you know.

05:03.955 --> 05:05.356
Monsters can be women too.

05:05.357 --> 05:06.857
(Rosa) Super progressive
attitude, Jake.

05:06.858 --> 05:08.225
Look, we are on your side.

05:08.226 --> 05:09.927
It's just, you're not
the most responsible person.

05:09.928 --> 05:10.994
We have to do our job.

05:10.995 --> 05:12.763
All right, fine.
You can see my bank records.

05:12.764 --> 05:14.465
But I always pay my power bill.

05:14.466 --> 05:15.766
Often late.

05:15.767 --> 05:18.068
One time in person
with Canadian pennies.

05:18.069 --> 05:19.703
Oh, my God, talking
about your finances

05:19.704 --> 05:21.037
makes me sweat behind the knees.

05:21.072 --> 05:22.072
Nice.

05:22.073 --> 05:23.072
Hey, speaking of funky smells,

05:23.108 --> 05:24.375
should we start this
investigation

05:24.376 --> 05:25.642
at the urinalysis lab?

05:25.643 --> 05:27.978
Hmm? Take a trip
to the old pee factory?

05:27.979 --> 05:29.179
Jake, you're suspended.

05:29.180 --> 05:31.014
Just go home, have a beer,
and smash something.

05:31.015 --> 05:32.149
That's what I'd do.

05:32.150 --> 05:33.617
Or take advantage
of this amazing city.

05:33.618 --> 05:34.785
Go sightseeing.

05:34.786 --> 05:36.220
MoMA has an exhibit
I'm dying to see.

05:36.221 --> 05:37.721
It's all about
office chair design.

05:37.722 --> 05:39.223
Oh!

05:39.224 --> 05:41.392
Look, I know technically
I'm not supposed to help out,

05:41.393 --> 05:43.092
but rules are made to be broken.

05:43.128 --> 05:44.294
They were made to be followed.

05:44.295 --> 05:45.396
Nothing is made to be broken.

05:45.397 --> 05:46.397
Uh, piñatas.

05:46.398 --> 05:47.797
- Glow sticks.
- Karate boards.

05:47.832 --> 05:49.266
Spaghetti when you
have a small pot.

05:49.267 --> 05:50.367
Rules.

05:50.368 --> 05:51.802
Look, someone's messing
with my life here.

05:51.803 --> 05:52.836
I thought you guys had my back.

05:52.837 --> 05:54.104
We do.

05:54.105 --> 05:55.739
But seriously,
you can't come with us.

05:55.740 --> 05:57.074
Okay.

05:57.075 --> 05:58.842
Fine.
I get it.

05:58.843 --> 06:00.711
Protocol's protocol.

06:00.712 --> 06:02.880
I'm gonna go check out
that office chair design exhibit

06:02.881 --> 06:03.880
at the MoMA.

06:06.229 --> 06:07.779
(Jake) Rosa? Amy?

06:07.797 --> 06:09.231
What are you guys doing here?

06:09.232 --> 06:10.699
Our non-suspended jobs.

06:10.700 --> 06:12.368
You're not supposed
to be investigating.

06:12.369 --> 06:13.702
I'm not, I'm sightseeing,

06:13.703 --> 06:15.137
just as Amy suggested.

06:15.138 --> 06:16.537
At Brooklyn Urine and Blood?

06:16.573 --> 06:17.940
Oh, yeah, the internet says

06:17.941 --> 06:19.475
this is the number-one
urinalysis lab

06:19.476 --> 06:20.576
in all of New York.

06:20.577 --> 06:21.944
Fun tourist selfie!

06:21.945 --> 06:23.779
Boink!
Not your best.

06:23.780 --> 06:26.115
Anyways, I'm gonna take
a "walking tour" in here

06:26.116 --> 06:27.783
while you guys ask
a couple of questions,

06:27.784 --> 06:29.485
and also, I've been
waiting for 20 minutes.

06:29.486 --> 06:30.686
Where have you been?

06:30.687 --> 06:32.054
We had to find the addresses
of all 78 people

06:32.055 --> 06:33.054
you said might want to hurt you.

06:33.089 --> 06:34.256
Uh-huh.

06:34.257 --> 06:36.099
And was there another
stop along the way?

06:36.126 --> 06:37.126
We got coffee.

06:37.127 --> 06:38.427
Those are cappuccinos.

06:38.428 --> 06:40.129
You know how long it takes
to foam that milk?

06:40.130 --> 06:41.630
Time you could have
spent on my case,

06:41.631 --> 06:43.940
but I guess it's just froth
over friends with you two.

06:43.967 --> 06:45.567
Anyways, let's do this.

06:45.568 --> 06:46.669
(Amy) Jake...

06:46.670 --> 06:48.170
I can't believe
I'm about to say this.

06:48.171 --> 06:50.839
I really wish you could come
look at urine with us,

06:50.840 --> 06:52.007
but you can't.

06:52.008 --> 06:53.575
You're suspended.
Go home.

06:53.576 --> 06:54.576
All right, fine.

06:54.577 --> 06:55.678
If you guys won't help me,

06:55.679 --> 06:58.180
I guess I'll just
get myself off.

06:58.181 --> 06:59.214
Context.

06:59.215 --> 07:00.581
Context was
important on that one.

07:00.617 --> 07:01.617
I get Greek yogurt,

07:01.618 --> 07:02.851
'cause there's heritage there,

07:02.852 --> 07:04.253
but Iceland?

07:04.254 --> 07:07.089
No, no, no, no, no!

07:07.090 --> 07:08.724
Hey, Gina!

07:08.725 --> 07:10.893
What are you guys talking about?
Yogurt? Me too.

07:10.894 --> 07:12.127
Let's keep talking about that.

07:12.128 --> 07:13.228
Whoo!

07:13.229 --> 07:14.330
Terry's out of breath.

07:14.331 --> 07:16.681
Cool. I was just
dropping off some files.

07:16.700 --> 07:18.267
Great, let's just
go out to your desk

07:18.268 --> 07:20.068
and let's talk
about how that went.

07:20.103 --> 07:21.470
Okay, Terry.

07:21.471 --> 07:23.105
But first, I want
to ask the captain

07:23.106 --> 07:25.307
for his impresh of my show.

07:25.308 --> 07:28.359
Got any feed-b, or was it just
love, love, love?

07:28.378 --> 07:30.012
Well, actually...

07:30.013 --> 07:31.880
(Terry)
I thought it was amazing!

07:31.881 --> 07:34.516
You were like a swan
who went to Juilliard.

07:34.517 --> 07:36.719
It was so good.

07:36.720 --> 07:39.288
Terry, I have already
received your praise.

07:39.289 --> 07:41.664
I'm clearly fishing
in another pond right now.

07:41.691 --> 07:43.041
I'm putting an end to this.

07:43.059 --> 07:44.193
Sergeant Jeffords and I

07:44.194 --> 07:47.463
were unable to attend
your performance.

07:47.464 --> 07:49.164
Oh.

07:49.165 --> 07:51.265
r compliments.

07:51.301 --> 07:53.134
Terry is a practiced liar.

07:53.169 --> 07:55.011
I'm sorry we missed the show.

07:55.038 --> 07:57.773
I know that dancing is
an important hobby to you.

07:57.774 --> 07:59.074
Hobby?

07:59.075 --> 08:00.516
You think my dancing is a hobby?

08:00.543 --> 08:01.643
Oh, yes.

08:01.644 --> 08:03.712
Like me and antique
globe collecting.

08:03.713 --> 08:06.782
It's thrilling, but nobody is
ever going to pay me for it.

08:06.783 --> 08:07.815
Ergo, a hobby.

08:07.851 --> 08:09.151
I get paid...

08:09.152 --> 08:10.853
in applause.

08:10.854 --> 08:12.612
But apparently not yours.

08:15.291 --> 08:18.076
I know that maintaining
integrity can be difficult,

08:18.094 --> 08:19.528
but in the long run,

08:19.529 --> 08:21.397
everyone is better for it.

08:21.398 --> 08:22.914
[electronic grinding]

08:24.267 --> 08:26.035
Attention everyone.

08:26.036 --> 08:29.671
The tragic sound you hear
is the shredding of my spandie.

08:29.672 --> 08:32.240
Gina Linetti
will never dance again.

08:34.977 --> 08:36.744
So those threatening phone calls

08:36.780 --> 08:38.614
were being made to Tim Orsk

08:38.615 --> 08:40.014
of Tim O's Limos.

08:40.049 --> 08:41.316
That's interesting.

08:41.317 --> 08:43.818
This Orsk guy's name keeps
cropping up in this case.

08:43.852 --> 08:45.421
'Cause he's the victim.

08:45.422 --> 08:47.056
You know, he's
the guy whose window

08:47.057 --> 08:49.425
was smashed with this rock.

08:49.426 --> 08:50.426
Okay?

08:50.427 --> 08:52.110
He's being extorted for $10,000.

08:52.128 --> 08:54.404
Sure, but what do
they want from him?

08:54.431 --> 08:55.864
$10,000.

08:55.865 --> 08:57.399
I just said that.

08:57.400 --> 09:00.201
We're trying to figure out
who's doing the threatening.

09:00.236 --> 09:02.504
Wait.
I have a theory.

09:02.505 --> 09:05.007
I think "limousine"
and "magazine"

09:05.008 --> 09:06.340
come from the same word.

09:06.376 --> 09:07.743
Just focus!

09:07.744 --> 09:09.178
I'm sorry for snapping.

09:09.179 --> 09:10.178
I interviewed Orsk...

09:10.213 --> 09:11.580
Orsk!
There it is again.

09:11.581 --> 09:12.981
Oh, you're useless!

09:12.982 --> 09:14.383
You're completely useless!

09:14.384 --> 09:16.618
You are without a doubt
the most incompetent detectives

09:16.619 --> 09:18.020
I've ever seen.

09:18.021 --> 09:19.888
And I'm including
that bomb-sniffing dog

09:19.889 --> 09:21.180
who humps all the bombs!

09:23.259 --> 09:25.794
(Rosa) You know your turning
signal's been on for 30 seconds.

09:25.795 --> 09:27.728
I like to announce
my turning intention.

09:27.764 --> 09:29.272
This isn't the Indy 500.

09:29.299 --> 09:31.733
Well, when you finally change
lanes an hour from now,

09:31.734 --> 09:33.135
we should go talk
to Jake's super...

09:33.136 --> 09:34.335
see if there was a power outage.

09:34.370 --> 09:35.704
What?
[both scream]

09:35.705 --> 09:36.839
Oh!

09:36.840 --> 09:38.156
Why would you do that?

09:38.174 --> 09:39.208
I just broke into your car

09:39.209 --> 09:40.742
and then
popped up without warning.

09:40.743 --> 09:41.826
Not cool.

09:41.845 --> 09:43.044
What the hell are you doing?

09:43.079 --> 09:44.980
I thought I was hitching
a ride to Rikers

09:44.981 --> 09:46.815
so we could interview
some convicts I put away,

09:46.816 --> 09:49.217
but apparently you're still
wasting time investigating me.

09:49.252 --> 09:52.087
Hey, it's your fault we have to
check up on your power outages.

09:52.088 --> 09:54.422
You have three mini-fridges
plugged in to the same outlet.

09:54.457 --> 09:56.674
Three mini-fridges are cheaper
than one regular one.

09:56.693 --> 09:58.026
We're just doing our jobs.

09:58.027 --> 09:59.027
Why don't you trust us?

09:59.028 --> 10:00.028
How can I?

10:00.029 --> 10:01.130
You didn't even know a man

10:01.131 --> 10:02.831
was lying
in the backseat of your car.

10:02.832 --> 10:04.633
And while you two
were busy lolly-gargling...

10:04.634 --> 10:06.201
I'm not familiar
with the expression...

10:06.202 --> 10:08.570
I was investigating.
I'll send you some selfies.

10:08.571 --> 10:09.972
Look, we're gonna
get to your list.

10:09.973 --> 10:11.740
We just have to rule out
other possibilities first.

10:11.741 --> 10:13.108
You know, there is a real chance

10:13.109 --> 10:14.609
that no one is after you.

10:14.644 --> 10:16.145
Yeah, but I'm telling you
that someone is.

10:16.146 --> 10:17.111
That should be enough.

10:17.147 --> 10:18.747
And we told you to trust us.

10:18.748 --> 10:19.780
That should be enough.

10:19.816 --> 10:21.083
All right, fine.
You don't want my help?

10:21.084 --> 10:22.049
You're not gonna get it.

10:22.085 --> 10:24.219
Dude...

10:24.220 --> 10:26.829
In fact, I'm deleting
your numbers from my phone.

10:26.856 --> 10:27.997
Just let us take you home.

10:28.024 --> 10:29.491
See you never.

10:29.492 --> 10:30.625
Fine.

10:34.898 --> 10:35.898
Where am I?

10:35.899 --> 10:37.633
[ice cream truck jingle playing]

10:37.634 --> 10:38.900
[engine revving]

10:44.807 --> 10:46.707
Hello, Peralta.

10:48.235 --> 10:50.417
(Jake) Geoffrey Hoytsman?

10:50.418 --> 10:52.018
You're the one
who's been sabotaging me?

10:52.019 --> 10:55.088
I'm just ruining your life
like you ruined mine.

10:55.089 --> 10:56.589
You never should
have arrested me.

10:56.624 --> 10:58.625
But I basically got
your cocaine charges dropped.

10:58.626 --> 11:00.793
You only had to do 40 hours
of community service.

11:00.828 --> 11:03.430
Right, but I wanted to
get them all done at once,

11:03.431 --> 11:06.466
so for energy, I did way too
much cocaine and meth.

11:06.467 --> 11:08.667
Went on a prolonged
psychotic episode

11:08.703 --> 11:10.737
involving assault,
public fornication,

11:10.738 --> 11:12.672
and, apparently,
the touching of my scrotum

11:12.673 --> 11:14.608
to every doorknob
in a synagogue.

11:14.609 --> 11:15.808
And you know what happened then?

11:15.843 --> 11:17.110
They thoroughly cleaned
the synagogue,

11:17.111 --> 11:18.311
you landed on your feet

11:18.312 --> 11:20.046
and pursued your true passion
of selling ice cream?

11:20.047 --> 11:21.248
None of that.

11:21.249 --> 11:24.017
I lost my job
and my wife and my home.

11:24.018 --> 11:25.519
An ex-client lent me this truck.

11:25.520 --> 11:26.753
He likes me
because I got him off

11:26.754 --> 11:27.953
on a strangle-and-mangle.

11:27.989 --> 11:29.522
You have a phrase for that?

11:29.557 --> 11:31.925
I used to, when I was
an awesome lawyer.

11:31.926 --> 11:34.226
Now I'm just another idiot
living in an ice cream truck.

11:34.262 --> 11:36.228
So that's why you put
drugs in my urine.

11:36.264 --> 11:38.198
Hey, that was <i> my</i> urine.

11:38.199 --> 11:39.832
Your urine is in there.

11:39.867 --> 11:41.300
Why would you keep my pee?

11:41.335 --> 11:43.003
I need belongings, Jake,

11:43.004 --> 11:44.104
to feel like a man.

11:44.105 --> 11:46.005
Look, this is a bad idea,
Hoytsman.

11:46.040 --> 11:48.207
People are gonna notice
if I disappear.

11:48.242 --> 11:50.210
See? Someone's already
looking for me.

11:50.211 --> 11:52.379
You're in big trouble, buddy.

11:52.380 --> 11:55.815
Your e-coupon for Big Mike's
Calzones expires today.

11:55.850 --> 11:56.950
You're damn right.

11:56.951 --> 11:58.385
And if I don't redeem that,

11:58.386 --> 12:00.719
Big Mike is gonna get
real suspicious.

12:00.755 --> 12:02.289
Big Mike is a cartoon

12:02.290 --> 12:04.224
with pizzas for eyes.

12:04.225 --> 12:05.591
All right, fine.

12:05.626 --> 12:07.726
Maybe not Big Mike,
but someone will.

12:07.762 --> 12:09.428
Shut up, Peralta!

12:09.464 --> 12:10.830
Oh, boy.

12:10.865 --> 12:12.799
Captain Holt,

12:12.800 --> 12:15.569
here's your CompStat report.

12:15.570 --> 12:17.304
This is how I move now.

12:17.305 --> 12:19.105
Walking is too close to dancing,

12:19.106 --> 12:21.741
and there's no more dance in me.

12:21.742 --> 12:24.344
Plus I'm hoping my leg
muscles will atrophy

12:24.345 --> 12:26.579
so I won't be
tempted to use them.

12:32.253 --> 12:35.221
I bet you feel real good about
calling her dancing hobby, huh?

12:35.256 --> 12:37.723
Sarcasm...
the coward's lie.

12:37.758 --> 12:38.891
I don't get it.

12:38.926 --> 12:40.560
Gina's always
so sure of herself.

12:40.561 --> 12:41.761
She usually doesn't care at all

12:41.762 --> 12:43.128
what people say
or think about her.

12:43.164 --> 12:45.432
Maybe not with
most people, Captain.

12:45.433 --> 12:46.867
But she cares what you think.

12:46.868 --> 12:48.100
[chair dragging]

12:49.570 --> 12:51.505
Fine.
I regret what I said.

12:51.506 --> 12:53.939
But now, I don't know how
to make it right with her.

12:53.975 --> 12:55.342
Lie!

12:55.343 --> 12:57.344
Look, yesterday I told my twins

12:57.345 --> 12:59.145
there were baby bunnies
in their stomachs

12:59.146 --> 13:00.579
to get them to eat lettuce.

13:00.615 --> 13:01.882
And that worked?

13:01.883 --> 13:04.150
Yeah, but then they refused
to drink their milk

13:04.151 --> 13:06.019
because they thought
the bunnies would drown.

13:06.020 --> 13:08.755
So I bought a couple rabbits
and told the girls

13:08.756 --> 13:10.990
that they hopped out of
their mouths while they slept.

13:11.025 --> 13:12.224
I've lost track of your point.

13:12.260 --> 13:13.360
They ate their lettuce,

13:13.361 --> 13:14.494
I'm stuck with two bunnies,

13:14.495 --> 13:16.061
and lying works!

13:19.053 --> 13:23.003
[muffled yelling]

13:23.004 --> 13:24.104
Pretty good gag, huh?

13:24.105 --> 13:25.772
A prostitute taught me
how to make it.

13:25.773 --> 13:27.274
Ugh.
Where were you?

13:27.275 --> 13:28.842
You were gone for three hours.

13:28.843 --> 13:31.677
I know because I sang "This Is
How We Do It" 143 times.

13:31.712 --> 13:34.347
Okay, well, I had to grab a few
things at the art supply store.

13:34.348 --> 13:36.416
Kidnapping is 90% crafting.

13:36.417 --> 13:38.885
Jake, you're gonna help me
get my life back.

13:38.886 --> 13:40.487
You're gonna confess, on video,

13:40.488 --> 13:42.689
to framing me for everything
that got me in trouble.

13:42.690 --> 13:44.123
And why would I do that?

13:44.158 --> 13:45.492
Because I'm high on bath salts,

13:45.493 --> 13:46.526
emotionally unstable,

13:46.527 --> 13:47.826
and pointing a gun at you.

13:47.862 --> 13:49.261
Let's make a movie!

13:50.598 --> 13:51.765
(Hitchcock) Hey, Boyle,

13:51.766 --> 13:53.666
guess who caught
the Tim O's Limos perp.

13:53.701 --> 13:55.335
Jake?

13:55.336 --> 13:56.336
Is Jake back?

13:56.337 --> 13:57.337
No, we did.

13:57.338 --> 13:58.505
Scully and Hitchcock.

13:58.506 --> 14:00.440
Signed confession.

14:00.441 --> 14:01.441
You called us useless.

14:01.442 --> 14:02.976
You called us incompetent.

14:02.977 --> 14:04.476
You called us zeros in the sack.

14:04.512 --> 14:05.644
Never happened.

14:05.680 --> 14:07.847
Well, someone said it
to me last night.

14:07.848 --> 14:10.216
Oh, uh, must have been my wife.

14:10.217 --> 14:11.650
How did you solve the case?

14:11.686 --> 14:13.219
We listened to those
voicemails again

14:13.220 --> 14:15.255
and noticed the sound
of parrots in the background.

14:15.256 --> 14:17.057
Got a list of employees,
did door duty

14:17.058 --> 14:19.224
asking neighbors
if any of them kept pet birds.

14:19.260 --> 14:22.228
(Hitchcock) We finally found
one who did, and guess what.

14:22.229 --> 14:25.197
The landscaping in front of his
building was covered with these.

14:25.232 --> 14:27.901
(Scully) Same type of rock that
was thrown through the window.

14:27.902 --> 14:29.002
I can't believe it.

14:29.003 --> 14:30.470
What, you don't think
it could break one?

14:30.471 --> 14:31.470
Watch.

14:33.574 --> 14:35.507
I meant I can't believe
you solved the case.

14:35.543 --> 14:36.942
Well, you were
wrong on that too.

14:39.747 --> 14:43.049
Hi.
My name is Jake Peralta,

14:43.050 --> 14:44.516
and this is my confession.

14:44.552 --> 14:47.052
I destroyed the good name
of an American hero...

14:47.088 --> 14:48.287
Geoffrey Hoytsman.

14:50.625 --> 14:52.525
I framed him
for drug possession,

14:52.526 --> 14:53.860
I got him fired from his job,

14:53.861 --> 14:55.495
and I planted his scrotal prints

14:55.496 --> 14:57.429
on the synagogue doorknobs.

14:57.465 --> 14:59.666
Great, now just eighty more
confessions to go.

14:59.667 --> 15:01.834
You've been very naughty.

15:01.869 --> 15:04.738
I threatened to blow
Mr. Hoytsman's head off

15:04.739 --> 15:06.506
if he didn't quote-unquote

15:06.507 --> 15:09.074
"really cheap out
on his dad's funeral."

15:09.110 --> 15:11.077
And while he slept,

15:11.078 --> 15:12.912
I logged in to
Hoytsman's computer

15:12.913 --> 15:15.315
and flooded it with Thai
pornography.

15:15.316 --> 15:16.382
Starts crying.

15:16.417 --> 15:18.151
"Starts crying"
is a stage direction,

15:18.152 --> 15:19.686
you imbecile!

15:19.687 --> 15:22.856
Also, I fathered two children
with Hoytsman's cleaning lady,

15:22.857 --> 15:24.624
and it was I,
disguised as Geoffrey,

15:24.625 --> 15:27.359
who spoke against her
at her political asylum hearing.

15:27.395 --> 15:28.460
God.

15:28.496 --> 15:29.840
You did it, not me.

15:31.098 --> 15:33.967
I am a horrible person
who has done horrible things

15:33.968 --> 15:35.768
to a truly decent man,

15:35.803 --> 15:39.606
which is why I've decided
to take my own life.

15:39.607 --> 15:41.040
Wait, no, I didn't decide that.

15:41.075 --> 15:42.274
Spoiler alert!

15:43.210 --> 15:45.640
(Jake on video)
Decided to take my own life.

15:45.641 --> 15:47.408
That last take sounded great.

15:47.409 --> 15:49.710
You really brought
my words to life.

15:49.711 --> 15:51.212
You know, I should write more.

15:51.213 --> 15:52.213
What a rush!

15:52.214 --> 15:54.181
Hoytsman, you don't
have to do this.

15:54.182 --> 15:55.416
Your life's not so bad.

15:55.417 --> 15:57.418
Living in an ice cream truck?
Never showering?

15:57.419 --> 15:58.886
That was my childhood dream.

15:58.887 --> 16:00.288
I had everything.

16:00.289 --> 16:03.891
I had friends, a wife,
two beautiful children...

16:03.892 --> 16:04.992
out of three total.

16:04.993 --> 16:06.127
Not a bad ratio.

16:06.128 --> 16:07.295
And now I have nothing

16:07.296 --> 16:08.296
and no one.

16:08.297 --> 16:09.397
Look, I get it.

16:09.398 --> 16:10.865
I know what that feels like.

16:10.866 --> 16:13.701
You've only lived in an ice
cream truck for part of one day!

16:13.702 --> 16:15.303
How could you possibly know?

16:15.304 --> 16:17.438
Well, I know no one's
coming to rescue me.

16:17.439 --> 16:19.740
I was so concerned with saving
myself and my reputation

16:19.741 --> 16:21.074
I pushed all my friends away.

16:22.444 --> 16:23.711
Wow.

16:23.712 --> 16:25.780
Sounds like you're
having a breakthrough.

16:25.781 --> 16:27.080
You should act on this.

16:27.115 --> 16:29.617
You still have time
to make it right.

16:29.618 --> 16:31.085
Really?
You're not gonna kill me?

16:31.086 --> 16:32.186
Oh, jeez.

16:32.187 --> 16:33.554
I totally forgot.

16:33.555 --> 16:35.690
Thanks for reminding me.
Of course I'm gonna kill you.

16:35.691 --> 16:38.192
Drugs make me say
such silly things.

16:38.193 --> 16:39.694
Drugs are so silly.

16:39.695 --> 16:42.897
Ooh, I'm gonna do some
right now.

16:42.898 --> 16:43.898
- Hoytsman.
- What?

16:43.899 --> 16:44.899
- Hyah!
- Oh!

16:44.900 --> 16:46.901
God!
That's my nose!

16:46.902 --> 16:48.335
That's where I put the drugs in!

16:48.370 --> 16:50.438
- Gyah!
- Oh!

16:50.439 --> 16:52.406
[grunting]

16:52.407 --> 16:54.075
So long, Hoytsman.

16:54.076 --> 16:56.009
Hyah!

16:56.044 --> 16:57.111
I can't move!

16:57.112 --> 16:59.547
I'm turtling.
I'm turtling!

16:59.548 --> 17:01.515
Nice try, Jake.

17:01.516 --> 17:02.550
Get up!

17:02.551 --> 17:03.683
I can't.

17:03.719 --> 17:05.185
Oh.

17:05.186 --> 17:06.453
Yeah. Okay.
My bad.

17:08.123 --> 17:09.723
What's this?

17:09.724 --> 17:13.694
I'm selling my smoke machine,
glitter cannon, and castanets.

17:13.694 --> 17:15.061
I would've put my soul on there,

17:15.063 --> 17:17.832
but that was shredded
along with my spandies.

17:17.833 --> 17:19.567
Gina, I want to
tell you something.

17:19.568 --> 17:22.303
Dancing is more than just
a hobby for you.

17:22.304 --> 17:23.637
It's a profession.

17:23.638 --> 17:25.539
Oh, so you're a liar
like Terry now?

17:25.540 --> 17:27.842
No, I'm no bunny-buying coward.

17:27.843 --> 17:29.777
You are a professional dancer,

17:29.778 --> 17:32.213
because I'm paying Dancy Reagan

17:32.214 --> 17:35.716
to perform two shows at
our at-risk youth program.

17:35.717 --> 17:36.884
Congratulations.

17:36.885 --> 17:40.054
Thank you, Captain.

17:40.055 --> 17:41.822
You just made me
the happiest, prettiest,

17:41.823 --> 17:43.357
most talented girl in the world.

17:43.358 --> 17:45.693
This is the best $8,000
you ever spent.

17:45.694 --> 17:47.127
It's $200.

17:47.162 --> 17:49.229
I'm sure you're
good for the rest.

17:49.264 --> 17:51.464
Captain loves my dancing.

17:57.839 --> 18:00.141
(Hoytsman)
This is why you're alone, Jake.

18:00.142 --> 18:01.509
We were bonding,

18:01.510 --> 18:02.543
talking about our pain,

18:02.544 --> 18:04.412
and you pull a stunt like that?

18:04.413 --> 18:05.546
You were gonna kill me.

18:05.547 --> 18:07.181
Deflect, deflect, deflect.

18:07.182 --> 18:09.650
This is why everyone hates you.

18:09.651 --> 18:10.851
(woman) You open?

18:10.852 --> 18:12.853
Okay.
You keep it shut.

18:12.854 --> 18:14.387
I really need this sale.

18:17.192 --> 18:19.325
Hello, ma...
whoa!

18:19.361 --> 18:20.361
[crying]

18:20.362 --> 18:21.429
Don't hurt me!

18:21.430 --> 18:23.397
I'm someone's little boy.

18:23.398 --> 18:25.099
Geoffrey Hoytsman,
you're under arrest.

18:25.100 --> 18:26.233
Ow.

18:26.234 --> 18:29.737
Oh, I am so relieved
you guys found me.

18:29.738 --> 18:30.937
Wait, how did you find me?

18:30.972 --> 18:32.506
You hadn't done anything
super annoying to us

18:32.507 --> 18:33.507
for, like, five hours,

18:33.508 --> 18:34.709
so we knew something was wrong.

18:34.710 --> 18:36.077
Oh, that's very insulting

18:36.078 --> 18:37.511
but dead on.

18:37.512 --> 18:39.814
We looked through those
irritating selfies you sent us,

18:39.815 --> 18:41.282
and in the background
of three of them

18:41.283 --> 18:42.383
was an ice cream truck.

18:42.384 --> 18:44.285
We ran the plates
and put out an APB.

18:44.286 --> 18:46.220
I'm sorry we doubted
anybody was sabotaging you.

18:46.221 --> 18:47.822
No, I'm the one
who should apologize.

18:47.823 --> 18:49.490
For some reason,
I have trouble believing

18:49.491 --> 18:50.691
people actually have my back.

18:50.692 --> 18:51.992
I don't know why.

18:51.993 --> 18:54.428
Probably my dad abandoning me.

18:54.429 --> 18:56.764
Maybe something I should work
out in therapy, but...

18:56.765 --> 19:00.401
who has an hour to spare
once every two weeks, right?

19:00.402 --> 19:01.402
Anyways,

19:01.403 --> 19:02.969
I'm sorry I acted
like a jackass.

19:03.004 --> 19:05.272
Wow, Jake, you're so sincere
since you got off coke.

19:05.273 --> 19:07.141
And meth.
That was the hard one to kick.

19:07.142 --> 19:09.343
No, the hard one to kick
is angel dust,

19:09.344 --> 19:11.812
which is why I am
locked in for life.

19:14.015 --> 19:15.015
Hey.

19:15.016 --> 19:16.250
I double checked your evidence.

19:16.251 --> 19:17.251
Everything looks good.

19:17.252 --> 19:19.353
I got to say...

19:19.354 --> 19:20.788
you guys are good cops.

19:20.789 --> 19:22.656
Hyeah, no doy!

19:22.657 --> 19:24.625
How do you think we got to be
the oldest guys here?

19:24.626 --> 19:25.726
By never being promoted

19:25.727 --> 19:27.428
and losing all
your money to divorces?

19:27.429 --> 19:28.796
And bad investments.

19:28.797 --> 19:31.198
Anyway, I'm sorry
for calling you useless.

19:31.199 --> 19:33.100
I'm gonna make sure
everyone knows you did good.

19:33.101 --> 19:34.335
- Boyle, please don't.
- Don't?

19:34.336 --> 19:35.736
(Hitchcock)
The last thing we need

19:35.737 --> 19:37.304
is to suddenly be
on everyone's A list.

19:37.305 --> 19:38.339
The ones to watch.

19:38.340 --> 19:39.340
The golden boys.

19:39.341 --> 19:40.707
Pair of red hot dicks.

19:40.742 --> 19:42.276
No one calls detectives
that anymore.

19:42.277 --> 19:43.611
People call detectives that?

19:43.612 --> 19:45.846
(Hitchcock) All that
investigating was exhausting.

19:45.847 --> 19:48.115
Besides, we did our share
of that in the '70s and '80s.

19:48.116 --> 19:51.018
Now we like to do paperwork
in our comfy chairs.

19:51.019 --> 19:52.653
If we're away from
our desks for too long,

19:52.654 --> 19:56.190
they'll update our computers,
and we'll lose Minesweeper.

19:56.191 --> 19:57.825
So please, don't tell anyone

19:57.826 --> 19:59.827
about the amazing work
we did today.

19:59.828 --> 20:01.395
I never said "amazing."

20:01.396 --> 20:03.297
You kind of just did your jobs.

20:03.298 --> 20:05.132
There you go.

20:05.133 --> 20:06.133
No, really.

20:06.134 --> 20:07.367
I mean, you also broke a window.

20:07.402 --> 20:08.635
Now you get it.

20:12.507 --> 20:14.341
(Holt) Your suspension
has been lifted, Peralta.

20:14.342 --> 20:15.843
Well, that's great news, sir.

20:15.844 --> 20:17.578
And now it is time
for the traditional

20:17.579 --> 20:18.913
handing back of gun and badge

20:18.914 --> 20:20.314
to the vindicated hero ceremony.

20:20.315 --> 20:21.482
Everyone in!

20:21.483 --> 20:23.116
I don't have your gun
or your badge.

20:23.151 --> 20:26.620
Just take form 891-underscore-J
down to the equipment room

20:26.621 --> 20:28.189
and retrieve your things there.

20:28.190 --> 20:29.924
I'm sorry,
but that's unacceptable.

20:29.925 --> 20:31.125
Come on, Captain.
I need this.

20:31.126 --> 20:32.126
We all need this!

20:32.127 --> 20:33.660
[all talking at once]

20:33.695 --> 20:36.063
Fine. Fine.

20:36.064 --> 20:37.897
If this will make you happy...

20:39.701 --> 20:42.570
I believe these belong to you.

20:42.571 --> 20:43.737
Congratulations.

20:43.738 --> 20:46.106
[applause]

20:46.107 --> 20:47.675
That's very nice.
Thank you.

20:47.676 --> 20:49.910
But as I've said before,
the system stinks,

20:49.911 --> 20:51.178
and this isn't over.

20:51.179 --> 20:53.514
I say we march down
to city hall!

20:53.515 --> 20:54.915
Get out of my office.

20:54.916 --> 20:55.916
Yup.

20:55.917 --> 20:59.698
