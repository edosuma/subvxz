00:10.750 --> 00:12.333
(dramatic music)

00:55.458 --> 00:56.291
- [Teacher] Are you focused?

00:58.750 --> 01:00.959
- [Student] Yes.

01:01.041 --> 01:02.125
- [Teacher] This is
just a simple test,

01:02.208 --> 01:05.458
but it will show me
how much you know.

01:05.542 --> 01:08.041
Now, I'm only doing
this for your mother.

01:08.125 --> 01:11.333
I don't normally change
my students' final grades.

01:12.875 --> 01:15.750
All right, now you come and
demonstrate the test for me.

01:15.834 --> 01:18.625
(dramatic music)

01:30.458 --> 01:31.000
- And if I do it
right this time,

01:31.083 --> 01:33.750
you'll actually pass me?

01:33.834 --> 01:35.625
- [Teacher] Yes, that's right.

01:35.709 --> 01:38.208
(potion bubbling)

01:38.291 --> 01:42.125
- [Student] Did I
do it ri- (coughing)

01:45.291 --> 01:48.125
(dramatic music)

01:55.333 --> 02:00.250
(potion bubbling)
(wind whistling)

02:02.750 --> 02:04.250
- Debunkers!

02:04.333 --> 02:05.000
Kiai!

02:05.083 --> 02:06.417
- Duty.
- Honor.

02:06.500 --> 02:08.625
- Courage.
- Cash flow.

02:08.709 --> 02:10.417
(upbeat music)

02:18.959 --> 02:21.750
- A company you can trust.

02:25.083 --> 02:28.333
- We serve justice to those
people in the United States.

02:30.542 --> 02:32.709
(shouts)

02:33.917 --> 02:34.834
(upbeats music)

02:34.917 --> 02:39.542
(speaks in foreign language)

02:41.458 --> 02:44.417
(metallic whooshing)

02:46.542 --> 02:48.291
(alarm blaring)

03:04.792 --> 03:07.291
- Call now for a
special edition mug.

03:07.375 --> 03:08.583
So...

03:08.667 --> 03:09.542
Amazing, right?

03:11.333 --> 03:11.625
- I-I really liked it.

03:11.709 --> 03:13.458
- Vlod.

03:13.542 --> 03:14.667
- Here we go.

03:14.750 --> 03:16.583
- They typeface doesn't
match our brand message.

03:16.667 --> 03:17.959
Plus there's not enough fear.

03:18.041 --> 03:20.417
It needs... more fear.

03:20.500 --> 03:21.834
- Doc?

03:21.917 --> 03:23.834
- I could tell that there was
a lot of heart and sincerity.

03:23.917 --> 03:24.709
- But...

03:24.792 --> 03:27.500
- But don't you
think that, maybe,

03:27.583 --> 03:29.375
people will be, I don't know,

03:29.458 --> 03:31.959
a little let down if
they actually hire us.

03:32.041 --> 03:33.375
- Why would you say that?

03:33.458 --> 03:34.750
- Uh, well...

03:34.834 --> 03:36.458
- Because we have solved a
grand total of three mysteries.

03:36.542 --> 03:37.834
Two of which were for Doc's mom.

03:37.917 --> 03:38.625
- She says thanks, by the way.

03:38.709 --> 03:40.166
- Don't write off
last semester's

03:40.250 --> 03:41.709
case of the ringing lockers.

03:42.792 --> 03:44.542
(whooshing)

03:44.625 --> 03:46.083
- We are still school heroes.

03:46.166 --> 03:48.250
- More like the
school's most wanted.

03:48.333 --> 03:50.417
- Okay, maybe, it was
borderline snitching.

03:50.500 --> 03:52.834
- Well, Link, I think
you're missing the point.

03:52.917 --> 03:55.250
- No, Snake, you're
missing the point.

03:55.333 --> 03:57.000
(hits desk)
(inhales sharply)

03:57.083 --> 03:57.917
Smoke and mirrors, fellas.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
Smoke and mirrors.

04:02.083 --> 04:04.333
We can't be focusing
on where we're at now.

04:04.417 --> 04:05.792
We have to imagine
where we're gonna be

04:05.875 --> 04:07.750
at the pinnacle of our success,

04:07.834 --> 04:10.375
and then project
that to the world.

04:10.458 --> 04:11.166
Now, in the secret--

04:11.250 --> 04:13.834
- [Both] The law of attraction--

04:13.917 --> 04:15.041
- Is the key to success.

04:15.792 --> 04:17.291
I can feel it.

04:17.375 --> 04:19.834
We are attracting something big,

04:19.916 --> 04:21.250
something important.

04:22.250 --> 04:24.375
And just in time for
a big day tomorrow.

04:24.792 --> 04:26.333
Senior year.

04:26.417 --> 04:29.333
The beginning of the
rest of our lives.

04:31.458 --> 04:33.875
All right, Snake, what's
next on the agenda?

04:33.959 --> 04:35.625
- The omnipotent
clipboard reveals.

04:37.875 --> 04:38.875
Intern?

04:38.959 --> 04:39.583
- We don't have an intern.

04:39.667 --> 04:40.667
- Yes, we do.

04:40.750 --> 04:42.500
Guys, I wanna
introduce you to Lexy.

04:42.583 --> 04:44.333
Lexy, you can come in now.

04:44.417 --> 04:48.583
(door creaks)
(heavenly music)

04:59.291 --> 05:00.709
- How long has she
been standing there?

05:00.792 --> 05:02.834
- Guys, Lexy's gonna
be our new intern.

05:07.166 --> 05:10.041
- Doc, can I, uh, can I talk
to you for just a second?

05:10.125 --> 05:12.625
- Yeah.
- Yeah, right over here.

05:12.709 --> 05:12.750
- Okay.

05:20.458 --> 05:22.834
(mischievous music)

05:22.917 --> 05:25.333
- How old are you?

05:25.417 --> 05:26.166
- Seventeen.

05:26.250 --> 05:26.959
(sighs)

05:27.041 --> 05:28.458
(sniffing)

05:31.417 --> 05:31.709
- Do you smell that?

05:31.792 --> 05:34.250
- No.

05:34.333 --> 05:36.458
- It's the smell of lies.

05:36.542 --> 05:39.208
(mischievous music)

05:39.291 --> 05:40.959
- You're the smell of lies.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.250
- Hah. Touche.

05:46.625 --> 05:50.458
(speaking in foreign language)

05:51.125 --> 05:54.917
(mysterious music)

06:00.041 --> 06:00.417
(sighs)

06:00.500 --> 06:01.750
Outta mana.

06:01.834 --> 06:03.000
(pendant whooshes)

06:03.083 --> 06:04.750
(sighs)

06:04.834 --> 06:07.208
you may be immune
to my mind control.

06:07.291 --> 06:09.000
So you must be well trained.

06:09.083 --> 06:10.041
No matter.

06:10.125 --> 06:14.041
Mark my words, I will
break you, break you.

06:16.375 --> 06:17.458
- Doc.
- Mm-hm.

06:17.542 --> 06:18.750
- You gotta reel in your
expectations a bit here.

06:18.834 --> 06:21.166
Okay?

06:21.250 --> 06:23.291
Look, I love the tenacity
of wanting an intern.

06:23.375 --> 06:24.709
But these kinds of surprises,

06:24.792 --> 06:27.500
they throw a real wrench
in our longterm vision.

06:27.583 --> 06:31.291
You see, there's a
chain of command here.

06:31.375 --> 06:34.000
And if that chain is broken,

06:34.083 --> 06:35.542
well, this whole company's
destined for bankruptcy.

06:35.625 --> 06:38.750
And remember, my name
is Link for a reason.

06:38.834 --> 06:39.583
- I-I know.

06:39.667 --> 06:40.792
- Okay, so you-you have to ask

06:40.875 --> 06:42.375
me about these
things beforehand.

06:42.458 --> 06:43.417
- Okay.

06:43.500 --> 06:44.208
- Before board meetings.

06:44.291 --> 06:45.041
- I know.

06:45.125 --> 06:45.875
- So we're cool?

06:45.959 --> 06:47.125
- Yeah.

06:47.208 --> 06:47.834
It's just that my mom--
- You just want

06:47.917 --> 06:48.792
what's best for the company.

06:48.875 --> 06:49.375
I know, okay.

06:49.458 --> 06:50.208
We all do.

06:50.291 --> 06:50.959
- No, it's that my mom told me

06:51.041 --> 06:52.166
I need to include her in, uh...

06:52.250 --> 06:54.834
- Why don't you tell us a
little bit about yourself, Lex.

06:54.917 --> 06:56.667
- Oh, well, Lexy's from Canada,

06:56.750 --> 06:58.709
and she's here on
an exchange program,

06:58.792 --> 06:59.959
and my parents are gonna be her

07:00.041 --> 07:02.083
host family for the
next six months.

07:02.166 --> 07:03.333
- Wow.

07:03.417 --> 07:04.125
You know what?

07:04.208 --> 07:05.083
That is great.

07:05.166 --> 07:07.834
I think diversity in
the workplace is really,

07:07.917 --> 07:08.959
really positive.

07:10.458 --> 07:12.250
- Uh, Lexy, go
introduce yourself.

07:13.125 --> 07:14.041
- Uh...
- Yeah.

07:14.125 --> 07:16.125
- Okay.
- Come on.

07:16.208 --> 07:19.125
(bass jazz music)

07:21.834 --> 07:21.875
- Um...

07:23.750 --> 07:25.125
Hi.

07:25.208 --> 07:27.834
My name is Lexy Baker.

07:27.917 --> 07:28.625
I'm from Halifax.

07:30.875 --> 07:34.083
It's a small town in Canada
where nothing really happens.

07:35.333 --> 07:37.250
This is my first
time in America.

07:39.333 --> 07:40.208
And I'm really
excited to be here

07:40.291 --> 07:44.542
working with you... at...

07:45.750 --> 07:46.875
Debunkers LLC--

07:47.834 --> 07:50.250
- Limited Liability Company.

07:50.333 --> 07:51.083
Nice, Lexy.

07:51.166 --> 07:52.625
We're happy to have you.

07:52.709 --> 07:55.208
I'm Link, founder and CEO.

07:55.291 --> 07:57.333
Dr. Mario, here,
is our co-founder

07:57.417 --> 07:58.875
and chief investigative officer.

07:58.959 --> 08:02.208
And this fine specimen is Snake.

08:02.291 --> 08:04.375
Snake is our VP of Special
Clandestine Maneuvers,

08:04.458 --> 08:06.375
as well as the secretary.

08:06.458 --> 08:08.500
We hired Snake just a year ago,

08:08.583 --> 08:11.041
and he's already a senior VP.

08:11.125 --> 08:13.041
See, Lexy, there's a lot of room

08:13.125 --> 08:14.375
to move up the ladder
and succeed here,

08:14.458 --> 08:16.625
because we believe
in upward mobility.

08:16.709 --> 08:20.250
The American dream is
alive and well, Lexy.

08:21.333 --> 08:23.166
You're lookin' at it.

08:23.583 --> 08:26.625
(jazz music)

08:26.709 --> 08:28.333
But you're just an
intern, and you'll be

08:28.417 --> 08:30.583
treated like garbage
from this point forth.

08:31.500 --> 08:32.708
Now don't think
we're gonna give you

08:32.792 --> 08:34.958
any kind of special
treatment or anything

08:35.041 --> 08:36.582
because you're a girl, okay.

08:36.667 --> 08:38.250
We all started at the bottom.

08:38.332 --> 08:40.750
It's just part of the
ethics of business.

08:40.833 --> 08:41.958
Now before you get settled in,

08:42.041 --> 08:42.875
make sure you read
our workplace rights.

08:42.958 --> 08:44.917
- [Snake] Why do
we still have that?

08:45.000 --> 08:47.083
- Did you really just
ask that question, Snake?

08:47.166 --> 08:48.166
I don't know.

08:48.250 --> 08:49.750
Maybe because it's the law.

08:49.834 --> 08:50.875
- Your mom's the law.

08:50.959 --> 08:52.750
- So, Lexy can stay?

08:52.834 --> 08:54.375
- Lexy can stay.

08:54.458 --> 08:57.000
But first, she must
answer the question.

08:58.500 --> 09:00.250
- You don't really think
she knows the answer to...

09:00.333 --> 09:03.625
the question, do you?

09:03.709 --> 09:04.750
- Let's hope she does.

09:05.875 --> 09:07.750
Otherwise, she's out.

09:07.834 --> 09:10.250
(suspenseful music)

09:10.333 --> 09:11.125
Lexy...

09:12.041 --> 09:14.250
Who's your favorite
Smash character?

09:18.834 --> 09:18.875
- Um...

09:21.041 --> 09:22.667
Mm...

09:26.709 --> 09:27.375
Sheik

09:27.458 --> 09:30.208
(sigh of relief)

09:31.542 --> 09:32.458
- She's in.

09:34.875 --> 09:38.250
As a true Debunker, your
identity can never be revealed.

09:38.333 --> 09:40.041
Lexy is dead. Sheik rises.

09:47.917 --> 09:51.041
Now... to close off
our last official

09:51.125 --> 09:52.750
board meeting of the summer,

09:52.834 --> 09:55.542
we have our most important
item on the agenda.

09:59.375 --> 10:01.458
- What is that?

10:01.542 --> 10:03.166
- Sheik, do you
know what this is?

10:03.250 --> 10:04.208
- A sign.
- No. Wrong.

10:04.291 --> 10:07.208
Not a sign, a billboard.

10:08.083 --> 10:09.583
Do you know what
we need to acquire

10:09.667 --> 10:11.458
ourselves a billboard, Sheik?

10:11.542 --> 10:13.500
- Paint.
- Money.

10:13.583 --> 10:15.333
We need an operating
income to get this bad boy

10:15.417 --> 10:18.625
so we can finally make
ourselves visible to the world.

10:19.750 --> 10:23.333
We have to create an
expectation of professionalism.

10:23.417 --> 10:26.291
Our mission is two simple words.

10:26.375 --> 10:27.875
The truth.

10:27.959 --> 10:28.959
What does truth mean?

10:31.709 --> 10:33.125
(sighs)

10:33.208 --> 10:33.750
Visibility.
- Visibility.

10:35.875 --> 10:35.959
- Thank you, Snake.

10:37.959 --> 10:40.542
Once we finally have
enough money for this,

10:40.625 --> 10:41.917
we'll be legit.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.291
- Well, I thought that's
what the commercial was for.

10:43.375 --> 10:44.250
- The commercial
was the beginning

10:44.333 --> 10:45.542
of our marketing campaign.

10:45.625 --> 10:46.875
- Link, I-I think
it's great, really.

10:46.959 --> 10:49.291
But don't you think
that maybe we should

10:49.375 --> 10:51.667
spend some time
on getting clients

10:51.750 --> 10:53.500
or getting better
at solving mysteries

10:53.583 --> 10:56.458
before we spend all this
money on a marketing campaign?

10:56.542 --> 10:57.709
- I'm with Doc on this one.

10:57.792 --> 10:59.250
The billboard's a bit excessive,

10:59.333 --> 11:00.583
although it is quite cool.

11:00.667 --> 11:01.875
- Now. (snaps fingers)

11:01.959 --> 11:03.792
See, now you're
gettin' it, Snake.

11:03.875 --> 11:06.333
- Doc, I know it's
hard to understand

11:06.417 --> 11:09.709
when you don't have
a-a CEO mind like me.

11:09.792 --> 11:13.750
But being a business, it's
not just about doing business.

11:14.667 --> 11:16.583
No, it's about looks.

11:17.458 --> 11:19.041
Being cool matters.

11:20.542 --> 11:22.917
Which is why tomorrow, when we
all walk through those gates,

11:23.000 --> 11:24.625
every move we make matters.

11:24.709 --> 11:26.667
We must get our name
on the lips of every

11:26.750 --> 11:30.208
student, faculty, and staff
member at that school.

11:30.291 --> 11:31.625
'Cause then, and only
then, we'll be cool.

11:31.709 --> 11:34.208
And once we're cool,
we'll be successful,

11:34.291 --> 11:36.250
and once we're successful,
(inhales sharply)

11:36.333 --> 11:36.625
do you know what we'll get?

11:36.709 --> 11:37.041
- Friends?

11:37.125 --> 11:38.750
- Power.

11:38.834 --> 11:39.834
- Dual citizenship?

11:39.917 --> 11:39.959
- Money.

11:42.083 --> 11:42.834
Lots of money.

11:44.291 --> 11:48.458
- And what about... the females?

11:50.792 --> 11:53.125
- We don't have room
for wishful thinking

11:53.208 --> 11:54.417
in this institution, Snake.

11:54.500 --> 11:55.000
You, of all people,
should know that.

12:02.834 --> 12:05.000
But I'm not saying
it's impossible.

12:07.500 --> 12:09.125
- [Link's Dad] Sam.

12:10.208 --> 12:12.709
(somber music)

12:16.250 --> 12:17.709
- Uh... kay, guys,
meeting adjourned.

12:17.792 --> 12:20.709
See you bright and
early tomorrow.

12:20.792 --> 12:21.750
We got a big day.

12:22.583 --> 12:25.166
(somber music)

12:56.500 --> 12:59.959
(gunfire on TV)

13:06.041 --> 13:09.208
(muffled speech on TV)

13:14.792 --> 13:16.208
Here you go, Dad.

13:17.125 --> 13:19.542
- [Link's Dad] Thanks, Sammy.

13:20.750 --> 13:22.542
How was your meeting?

13:23.667 --> 13:25.667
- It was really good.

13:25.750 --> 13:27.166
We're growing pretty quickly.

13:28.458 --> 13:31.041
(somber music)

13:32.959 --> 13:35.875
(muffled speech on TV)

13:35.959 --> 13:36.917
Love you, Dad.

13:37.458 --> 13:40.000
(somber music)

13:41.625 --> 13:44.083
- Love you too, buddy.

13:46.291 --> 13:51.291
(somber music)
(muffled speech on TV)

13:52.667 --> 13:53.875
- I'm sorry, I-I...

13:53.959 --> 13:54.041
- It's okay.

13:56.166 --> 13:58.417
Make sure you have everything
ready for tomorrow.

13:58.500 --> 13:59.417
Big day, buddy.

14:00.542 --> 14:04.792
(muffled speech on TV)

14:06.458 --> 14:07.083
- Did he go to any interviews?

14:13.166 --> 14:14.667
(mysterious music)

14:14.750 --> 14:18.834
(students chattering)

14:21.000 --> 14:23.750
(student laughs)

14:37.750 --> 14:38.917
Oh, here.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.709
I made some flyers last night.

14:40.792 --> 14:42.792
We should put up 10
by the end of the day.

14:42.875 --> 14:45.291
- Do you really think putting
up posters is gonna work?

14:45.375 --> 14:45.959
- Yes, I do.

14:46.041 --> 14:47.125
Do you have a better idea?

14:47.208 --> 14:49.500
- It just seems like if
you're a covert detective--

14:49.583 --> 14:51.083
- Ey-ey, um...

14:51.166 --> 14:53.208
Don't forget you're
still just the intern.

14:53.291 --> 14:54.166
Okay?

14:54.250 --> 14:54.291
Now had me some tacks.

14:56.750 --> 14:58.500
- I don't have tacks.

15:00.166 --> 15:02.125
- You're the intern, and
you don't have tacks?

15:02.208 --> 15:03.417
Are you serious?
- Here.

15:04.583 --> 15:06.750
(Snake sniffs)

15:06.834 --> 15:07.917
What?

15:08.000 --> 15:09.875
- Did you forget
to wear deodorant?

15:10.709 --> 15:11.834
- Oh, shoot!

15:11.917 --> 15:13.792
- Oh.
- Really, Doc.

15:13.875 --> 15:14.959
- [Snake] You cannot be standing

15:15.041 --> 15:16.166
next to me.
- I'm such an idiot!

15:16.250 --> 15:17.208
- [Sheik] I have some.

15:17.291 --> 15:18.333
(sighs)

15:18.417 --> 15:19.333
- You have deodorant
and not tacks?

15:19.417 --> 15:20.166
- [Doc] Perfect.

15:20.250 --> 15:20.917
- Remarkable.

15:21.000 --> 15:21.792
Quick, put it on.

15:21.875 --> 15:23.291
- Do not take your shirt off.

15:25.291 --> 15:26.125
- Keep your shirt on!

15:26.208 --> 15:27.500
- I have to take my shirt off,

15:27.583 --> 15:28.458
otherwise it'll stain it.

15:28.542 --> 15:32.208
- Eight, 29, 16, 1300 hours.

15:32.291 --> 15:33.333
- Hurry!

15:33.417 --> 15:34.166
- This is the worst
moment of my life.

15:34.250 --> 15:34.291
- Guys, six o'clock.

15:38.208 --> 15:39.166
- Hey, boys.

15:39.250 --> 15:40.375
What's up?

15:40.458 --> 15:40.709
- Hey.

15:40.792 --> 15:42.583
- Hi.

15:42.667 --> 15:44.625
My shirt was off,
but now it's...

15:45.583 --> 15:46.500
It's on.

15:46.583 --> 15:48.500
- Ooh, and a, uh, lady.

15:48.583 --> 15:50.333
What are you doin' hangin'
out with these fellas?

15:50.417 --> 15:52.709
(metallic whooshing)

15:52.792 --> 15:56.166
(digital beeping)

15:56.250 --> 15:58.000
- Sh-she's our friend.
- Intern.

15:58.917 --> 16:00.500
Same thing.

16:00.583 --> 16:01.959
- Well, I dig the shirts, dudes.

16:02.041 --> 16:03.750
- Oh, um, our marketing
team designed these.

16:03.834 --> 16:05.041
If you guys would
like to buy one,

16:05.125 --> 16:05.709
they're available on Am--
- Cool.

16:05.792 --> 16:07.625
What are the flyers for?

16:07.709 --> 16:09.375
(paper rustles)

16:09.458 --> 16:10.166
- [Clark] Excuse me.

16:11.458 --> 16:13.041
- [Both] Debunkers LL--

16:13.125 --> 16:13.583
- Limited Liability Company.

16:13.667 --> 16:15.750
- Excuse me?

16:15.834 --> 16:16.542
- Our company.

16:16.625 --> 16:19.166
It's a pass through tax entity.

16:19.250 --> 16:19.458
- Company?

16:19.542 --> 16:21.166
Wow.

16:21.250 --> 16:22.125
You guys actually own a company?

16:22.208 --> 16:23.291
- Yes, we do.

16:23.375 --> 16:24.709
We filed in the state of
Delaware last January.

16:24.792 --> 16:26.625
- What kind of company?

16:26.709 --> 16:28.083
- We're a partnership,
but taxed as an S corp.

16:29.917 --> 16:31.000
- What, y-you're a what?

16:31.083 --> 16:32.125
- We solve mysteries
and shed rays of light

16:32.208 --> 16:34.834
over dark shadows of
illusion and fabricacion.

16:34.917 --> 16:36.875
- [Link] Yep. (clicks tongue)

16:36.959 --> 16:37.959
- [Doc] Good job.

16:38.041 --> 16:38.709
- Well... (chuckles)

16:38.792 --> 16:39.542
That sounds interesting.

16:39.625 --> 16:40.333
I'm Russell.

16:40.417 --> 16:41.208
Uh, this here's Clark.
- Hi.

16:41.291 --> 16:44.667
- Um, I don't own
a company, but my,

16:44.750 --> 16:45.959
my dad does, so...

16:46.041 --> 16:47.500
- You guys must be seniors.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.458
- Yeah, we are.
- Yes, yes, we are.

16:51.542 --> 16:53.000
- Yeah, we are too.

16:53.083 --> 16:54.083
(laughs nervously)

16:54.166 --> 16:55.041
all of us.

16:56.041 --> 16:57.875
- Well, good luck with
the business, boys.

16:57.959 --> 16:58.917
And, uh, let us know
how we can help.

16:59.000 --> 16:59.709
All right?

16:59.792 --> 17:00.583
We'll be around.

17:00.667 --> 17:01.625
- Yeah, great.
- Thank you so much.

17:01.709 --> 17:03.000
- Yeah, no problem.

17:04.458 --> 17:05.290
Let's get outta here.

17:06.625 --> 17:08.250
- Okay.

17:09.333 --> 17:10.834
Bye.

17:10.834 --> 17:12.834
Oh god, they were really nice.

17:12.916 --> 17:14.791
- You just had to
take your shirt off.

17:14.875 --> 17:17.083
- Well, excuse me,
Mr. Fabrication--

17:17.165 --> 17:18.375
- Hey, hey, both of you--

17:18.458 --> 17:18.834
- You're (mutters)!

17:18.916 --> 17:20.375
- Whoa, whoa.

17:20.458 --> 17:21.250
Dude, just let me--

17:21.333 --> 17:22.125
(shouting over each other)

17:22.208 --> 17:25.290
(ominous music)

17:25.375 --> 17:27.709
- Commercial sign, no allowed.

17:29.375 --> 17:32.083
(ominous music)

17:37.208 --> 17:39.583
(bell rings)

17:50.291 --> 17:54.000
I find another...
you get detention.

17:56.458 --> 17:58.166
(ominous music)

18:06.625 --> 18:09.041
(bell rings)

18:09.125 --> 18:09.792
(students chattering)

18:09.875 --> 18:10.583
(students laughing)

18:10.667 --> 18:11.834
- Traitor.

18:11.917 --> 18:14.709
And to think, I took her in.

18:14.792 --> 18:15.959
- Come on, guys.

18:16.041 --> 18:18.625
We should be happy for her.

18:18.709 --> 18:20.500
She's making friends
in a new country.

18:20.583 --> 18:21.834
- And losing others.

18:21.917 --> 18:23.000
- Don't say that.

18:23.750 --> 18:25.000
- Look at us.

18:25.083 --> 18:26.917
No leads, no friends.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.041
And to top it all off,

18:29.125 --> 18:30.333
our intern is the worst
wingman in history.

18:31.542 --> 18:33.291
(sighs)

18:33.375 --> 18:33.917
Guys, this is embarrassing.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.250
- I despise this level.

18:36.750 --> 18:38.375
- What level?

18:39.542 --> 18:40.834
- You wouldn't understand.

18:42.625 --> 18:42.917
- [Link] No way.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.417
(sighs)

18:44.500 --> 18:45.291
- Impossible.

18:45.375 --> 18:46.166
- See, I told you she's loyal.

18:46.250 --> 18:49.083
- All right, let
me do the talking.

18:49.166 --> 18:51.750
(upbeat music)

19:04.333 --> 19:05.041
(shouts)

19:05.125 --> 19:05.834
(laughs)

19:05.917 --> 19:06.333
- Oh!

19:06.417 --> 19:07.583
(inhales sharply)

19:07.667 --> 19:07.917
Sorry 'bout that, boys.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.208
Uh...

19:10.291 --> 19:10.750
It's all right, hey,
you probably got book
insurance, right?

19:10.834 --> 19:11.583
Right?
(chuckles)

19:11.667 --> 19:13.375
- No.

19:13.458 --> 19:15.166
Because that's not a real thing.

19:15.250 --> 19:18.500
We do, however, have a great
team of prosecuting attorneys.

19:18.583 --> 19:19.959
- And fists.

19:21.625 --> 19:22.542
- Don't think
that'll be necessary,

19:22.625 --> 19:25.000
but it's nice runnin'
into you boys again.

19:25.083 --> 19:25.709
(chuckles)

19:25.792 --> 19:27.000
Goin' deep, deep ball.

19:27.083 --> 19:27.917
- Yeah, hey.
- Found it.

19:28.041 --> 19:29.417
Run the wide, run the wide!

19:29.500 --> 19:31.417
(guys chattering)

19:31.500 --> 19:33.625
(laughs excitedly)

19:33.709 --> 19:36.125
- Sorry, guys.

19:36.208 --> 19:39.417
Um, I tried to get them to
talk to you, but I failed.

19:39.500 --> 19:41.625
- Yeah, ya did.

19:41.709 --> 19:42.375
- It was a valiant
effort, Sheik.

19:42.458 --> 19:44.458
- It was too good to be true.

19:46.208 --> 19:49.250
(mysterious music)

19:53.709 --> 19:55.375
- Excuse me?

20:00.417 --> 20:02.083
Are you guys the Debunkers?

20:05.500 --> 20:06.792
- Hi, I'm, uh, Link!
- Hi, I'm Dr. Mario.

20:06.875 --> 20:07.959
- CEO of Debunkers LLC.
- Vice President of

20:08.041 --> 20:10.458
Clandestine Maneuvers.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.458
- H-how can we help you?

20:12.542 --> 20:13.834
- You're detectives?

20:13.917 --> 20:15.959
- You guys solve
mysteries, right?

20:16.041 --> 20:17.583
- Yeah, we're the
best in our field.

20:19.166 --> 20:20.625
- We have a perfect record.

20:20.709 --> 20:21.500
(speaking foreign language)

20:21.583 --> 20:24.709
- Have you dealt
with curses before?

20:24.792 --> 20:27.583
(mysterious music)

20:29.834 --> 20:30.834
- What kind of curse?

20:31.875 --> 20:32.917
- The ghost of a murdered girl.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.458
(ominous music)

20:46.709 --> 20:47.875
(projector whirs)

20:47.959 --> 20:52.041
(Snake sniffs)

20:52.125 --> 20:55.792
- Okay, go ahead,
at your own speed.

20:55.875 --> 20:57.500
- Don't leave out
any of the details.

20:57.583 --> 21:01.792
- Or smells.

21:01.792 --> 21:03.750
- She was our friend.

21:03.834 --> 21:06.083
We took Chemistry class
together this summer.

21:06.750 --> 21:08.875
- School during the summer.

21:09.875 --> 21:11.083
So, a summer school.

21:12.709 --> 21:13.834
- Yes, summer school.

21:14.917 --> 21:17.333
- Hm, continue.

21:19.083 --> 21:22.500
- Well, one day we just
stopped hearing from her.

21:22.583 --> 21:24.375
- We found out there
was an accident.

21:26.250 --> 21:27.166
- She was killed.

21:28.125 --> 21:30.750
(somber music)

21:38.291 --> 21:40.000
- Do you think you can
describe for us the incident?

21:40.083 --> 21:41.458
As much detail as possible.

21:44.125 --> 21:47.750
(thunder crashes)

21:52.125 --> 21:54.792
(somber music)

21:58.667 --> 21:58.709
Got it.

22:00.333 --> 22:01.291
What was her name?

22:02.333 --> 22:04.875
(somber music)

22:06.500 --> 22:07.500
- Nina, Nina Galanosa.
- Shh.

22:10.041 --> 22:11.667
Don't say her name out loud.

22:11.750 --> 22:12.542
- No need to fear.

22:12.625 --> 22:14.709
(speaking foreign language)

22:14.792 --> 22:19.041
Name taboos are quite common,
but pure myth nonetheless.

22:20.250 --> 22:22.208
- [Heather] You haven't
seen what we've seen.

22:22.834 --> 22:24.291
- [Snake] I know things.

22:25.834 --> 22:27.041
- You mentioned a curse?

22:28.333 --> 22:29.500
- Yes, where she died.

22:30.041 --> 22:32.667
(somber music)

22:35.333 --> 22:36.333
- Which was where?

22:39.041 --> 22:41.667
- The Chemistry Lab.

22:41.750 --> 22:43.041
- [Heather] Classroom E12.

22:44.500 --> 22:45.959
The accident happened in there.

22:46.041 --> 22:48.709
- It wasn't an accident.
- We don't know that, Joyce.

22:50.166 --> 22:53.750
We do know that they've kept
it locked up ever since.

22:53.834 --> 22:55.333
So something serious
happened in there,

22:55.417 --> 22:57.291
and things weren't adding up.

22:57.375 --> 22:59.875
- So we went looking to
see what we could find.

22:59.959 --> 23:01.667
- You mean you entered the room?

23:01.750 --> 23:02.458
- Yes--

23:02.542 --> 23:03.458
- And we, saw...

23:04.208 --> 23:07.208
(mysterious music)

23:07.291 --> 23:08.375
Okay, I don't know
what we're doing

23:08.458 --> 23:09.333
'cause you're not
gonna believe us.

23:09.417 --> 23:10.792
You're gonna think we're crazy.

23:10.875 --> 23:12.083
- What? What?

23:12.166 --> 23:13.083
What did you see?

23:15.875 --> 23:17.458
It's okay.

23:17.542 --> 23:18.458
You can tell us.

23:19.542 --> 23:20.625
- You can trust us.

23:21.542 --> 23:24.375
(dramatic music)

23:33.125 --> 23:34.792
- We saw a ghost.

23:34.875 --> 23:36.750
- And then we ran,
and it followed us

23:36.834 --> 23:38.166
down the hallway screaming.

23:39.333 --> 23:39.875
I can still hear it.

23:39.959 --> 23:42.500
- It's okay, it's okay.

23:42.583 --> 23:44.959
- They say you can
hear her crying

23:45.041 --> 23:47.166
in the women's bathroom
if you listen hard enough.

23:47.250 --> 23:48.667
- Women's bathroom, you say.

23:50.041 --> 23:50.667
W-we should go
investigate immediately.

23:50.750 --> 23:53.166
- Um, we're so sorry for how

23:53.250 --> 23:54.709
much you both have been through.

23:54.792 --> 23:57.250
Let us process this much,
and we'll get back to you.

23:58.041 --> 23:59.667
- Yeah.

24:03.625 --> 24:04.792
- Snake, what was that?

24:04.875 --> 24:06.500
- Yeah, you were about
to scare them away.

24:06.583 --> 24:08.625
- Excuse me for doing my job.

24:08.709 --> 24:10.750
- It's our duty to take
ever lead, but s...

24:13.125 --> 24:15.667
- [Doc] What?

24:15.750 --> 24:17.458
- [Snake] He has an idea.

24:17.542 --> 24:19.583
(mysterious music)

24:22.625 --> 24:25.875
- They said the
entered the classroom.

24:25.959 --> 24:26.834
- [Doc] Yes, and...

24:27.834 --> 24:30.834
- They said it was locked
since the incident.

24:30.917 --> 24:35.583
- So how could they
have possibly gotten
in? (snaps fingers)

24:35.667 --> 24:36.375
(snaps fingers)

24:36.458 --> 24:39.291
(dramatic music)

24:42.125 --> 24:43.250
(door creaks)

24:43.333 --> 24:45.208
Excuse me, ladies!

24:45.291 --> 24:47.375
We just have one more
question for you!

24:47.458 --> 24:48.709
(breathing heavily)

24:48.792 --> 24:50.667
- A little snafu in your logic.

24:50.750 --> 24:50.792
- Heather.

24:52.625 --> 24:55.250
How was your first day
of senior year, sweetie?

24:57.041 --> 24:58.041
- Oh, hello, boys.

24:58.125 --> 25:00.000
Uh, I'm your new
principal, Ms. Barkley.

25:00.083 --> 25:01.000
And you are?

25:01.083 --> 25:02.750
- Seniors.

25:05.583 --> 25:08.417
- Well, I like the
matching shirts.

25:08.500 --> 25:11.417
Well, enjoy your
first day, gentlemen.

25:11.500 --> 25:14.709
And I will see you after
rehearsal, Heather.

25:14.792 --> 25:15.625
- Bye, Ms. Barkley.

25:17.125 --> 25:19.834
(ominous music)

25:27.375 --> 25:29.500
- [Link] So, your mom's
the new principal.

25:29.583 --> 25:32.041
- Yeah, I don't usually
like to tell anyone.

25:32.125 --> 25:33.291
- So you got the keys
from her office, then?

25:33.375 --> 25:35.542
- And heard about the accident.

25:35.625 --> 25:38.333
- I went in her
office to go through

25:38.417 --> 25:40.000
student records
after the accident.

25:40.083 --> 25:43.625
- But if she ever found out,
we'd be in so much trouble.

25:43.709 --> 25:44.875
- [Heather] Can
you guys help us?

25:44.959 --> 25:46.792
- Please help us.

25:46.875 --> 25:47.417
Make us believe
we're not insane.

25:47.500 --> 25:49.750
- Oh, you're not insane.

25:49.834 --> 25:51.000
- Nay.

25:51.083 --> 25:53.792
You're but pawns in a
cruel and unusual world.

25:53.875 --> 25:54.500
- [Link] We will get
to the bottom of it.

25:54.583 --> 25:57.166
- Yeah, and do a full inquiry.

25:57.250 --> 25:59.625
- Uh, but ladies, I
do have to mention,

25:59.709 --> 26:01.667
a job like this will cost you.

26:01.750 --> 26:04.250
It'll involve a lot of
work, subcontracting,

26:04.333 --> 26:05.959
insurance, top of
the line equipment.

26:06.041 --> 26:06.709
- Will a thousand dollars work?

26:09.291 --> 26:11.125
- We can make that work.

26:11.208 --> 26:12.291
- Thank you, seriously.

26:12.375 --> 26:13.959
- We should do a full
inquiry this afternoon.

26:14.041 --> 26:14.959
Not a moment to waste.

26:15.041 --> 26:16.583
- And I got everything I need.

26:16.667 --> 26:18.625
(sniffing)

26:18.709 --> 26:19.667
- What's that smell.

26:21.875 --> 26:22.875
- The smell of truth.

26:24.542 --> 26:26.125
- Emergency board
meeting commencing now.

26:26.208 --> 26:30.125
Start time, 4:57 PM.
- I call dibs on Joyce.

26:30.208 --> 26:32.458
(sprinkler sputtering)

26:32.542 --> 26:34.500
It's okay, you can be jealous.

26:34.583 --> 26:35.333
- You wish.

26:35.417 --> 26:37.166
- You can't call dibs on a girl.

26:37.250 --> 26:38.625
- She touched me first,
and we had a total

26:38.709 --> 26:40.834
of three moments in
that conversation.

26:40.917 --> 26:41.667
- Hey, guys.

26:41.750 --> 26:43.667
We need to stay focused here.

26:43.750 --> 26:45.208
Plus, clearly,
Joyce was into Snake

26:45.291 --> 26:45.959
and Heather was into me.

26:46.041 --> 26:47.083
- Well, okay.
- Copy that.

26:47.166 --> 26:49.125
- Show me the proof--
- Can we just stay focused?

26:49.208 --> 26:50.333
- You're so jealous.
- Hey.

26:50.417 --> 26:51.959
A thousand dollars.

26:52.041 --> 26:53.500
Guys, they're gonna
pay us a thousand

26:53.583 --> 26:55.083
dollars to solve this mystery.

26:55.166 --> 26:56.917
This is exactly what we needed.

26:57.000 --> 26:57.792
- Seems too good to be true.

26:57.875 --> 27:00.625
What if they're
just making it up.

27:00.709 --> 27:01.500
- They were crying.

27:01.583 --> 27:02.709
- So? You're point?

27:02.792 --> 27:05.208
- Her point is they
weren't making it up.

27:05.291 --> 27:06.166
There was genuine
fear in her eyes.

27:06.250 --> 27:08.375
Plus, Heather's mom
is the principal.

27:08.458 --> 27:10.333
That's a primary
reliable source.

27:10.417 --> 27:11.041
- Yeah, did you
see the way she was

27:11.125 --> 27:12.750
looking up at that classroom.

27:12.834 --> 27:15.333
I mean, it was so
obvious, something is up.

27:15.417 --> 27:17.250
- And we're gonna get
to the bottom of it.

27:17.333 --> 27:18.917
Now, first thing's first.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.083
Sheik, I need you to
make sure our business

27:21.166 --> 27:22.875
checking account is open
and ready to intercept

27:22.959 --> 27:24.250
the thousand dollar
payment when we receive it.

27:24.333 --> 27:28.000
- Um... okay.

27:28.083 --> 27:29.542
- We need to treat this
like every other job

27:29.625 --> 27:30.750
and do our due diligence.

27:30.834 --> 27:32.333
(sniffs)

27:32.417 --> 27:33.125
Rats!

27:33.208 --> 27:34.542
- What?

27:34.625 --> 27:36.375
- Oh, I forgot to have
them sign a contract.

27:36.458 --> 27:37.709
Idiot! What an idiot!

27:37.792 --> 27:39.208
- Link, it's not the
end of the world.

27:39.291 --> 27:40.166
- Or is it?

27:41.792 --> 27:43.750
- The second I get home, I'll
do some background research.

27:45.959 --> 27:47.458
- I'll go to the library
and conjure up a floor plan.

27:47.542 --> 27:48.750
- Well, I'll see if
there's anymore witnesses.

27:50.709 --> 27:52.125
- Okay, excellent.

27:53.583 --> 27:55.834
- Hey, you're really gettin'
the hang of this, Sheik.

27:58.125 --> 28:00.333
(sprinkler sputtering)

28:00.417 --> 28:02.917
(jazzy music)

28:18.208 --> 28:20.000
- [Link] I need an update.

28:20.083 --> 28:22.083
- Um, I found a janitor that has

28:22.166 --> 28:24.542
an eye witness report
of weird sounds,

28:24.625 --> 28:25.125
and I recorded it on--
- Sheik, can you

28:25.208 --> 28:26.417
pick us up some pizza?

28:27.667 --> 28:30.291
- Um, I was gonna explain to--

28:30.375 --> 28:31.333
- Immediately.

28:33.834 --> 28:34.750
I'm quite hungry.

28:40.208 --> 28:41.458
- Can I stay, because I--

28:41.542 --> 28:43.417
- I am your boss.

28:43.500 --> 28:44.166
That was an order.

28:44.250 --> 28:45.875
- Um...

28:47.709 --> 28:48.834
Okay, yeah.

28:48.917 --> 28:52.709
- Left, right, left, right.
- I'm going.

28:54.333 --> 28:56.834
- Keep the recei- (sighs)

28:56.917 --> 28:58.041
- What was that?

28:58.125 --> 29:00.291
- I'm hungry. (exhales deeply)

29:00.375 --> 29:02.458
- Snake, you've gotta
get over it, man.

29:02.542 --> 29:03.458
- Get over what?

29:03.542 --> 29:05.500
- Having a girl around.

29:05.583 --> 29:07.083
- I am more than
capable of dealing

29:07.166 --> 29:08.417
with the likes of--
- Snake.

29:10.083 --> 29:10.125
- Yes?

29:11.709 --> 29:13.041
- Did you get the layouts?

29:15.083 --> 29:16.208
(exhales sharply)

29:16.291 --> 29:17.917
- Yes.

29:20.959 --> 29:23.625
I have an entry point
and an award winning

29:23.709 --> 29:26.417
break in strategy ready to go.

29:29.583 --> 29:31.709
- Man, this place is a fortress.

29:31.792 --> 29:32.333
- Private schools.

29:32.417 --> 29:34.125
- All right, Doc.

29:35.083 --> 29:36.750
What have you got for us?

29:36.834 --> 29:37.500
- Hit the lights.

29:37.583 --> 29:41.375
(mysterious music)

29:45.917 --> 29:46.792
Okay, guys.

29:46.875 --> 29:48.417
I'm pretty proud of this on.

29:48.500 --> 29:49.417
We hit a goldmine,
and these girls

29:49.500 --> 29:51.917
have no idea what they
got themselves into.

29:52.917 --> 29:54.333
Look. Next slide.

29:54.417 --> 29:58.166
(mysterious music)

30:00.667 --> 30:03.291
According to the Hawkview blog,

30:03.375 --> 30:05.375
six weeks ago, Nina Galanosa's

30:05.458 --> 30:07.667
body was found in classroom E12.

30:08.458 --> 30:09.291
Next slide.

30:12.500 --> 30:15.542
The cause of the death was
never officially determined,

30:15.625 --> 30:17.875
but reports range from heart
attack to allergic reactions.

30:17.959 --> 30:21.250
And since the
event, next slide...

30:24.291 --> 30:26.375
there have been rumors
of strange sounds

30:26.458 --> 30:27.875
coming from the classroom

30:27.959 --> 30:30.542
and mysterious anomalies
happening in the hallways.

30:30.625 --> 30:31.458
"The ghost of Nina
Galanosa lives on."

30:31.542 --> 30:34.375
says one student reporter.

30:34.458 --> 30:36.417
- Sounds like an accident
and runaway rumor.

30:36.500 --> 30:38.583
No motives.

30:38.667 --> 30:41.291
- Sounds like it,
but check this out.

30:41.375 --> 30:44.000
There are no records
of Nina Galanosa's body

30:44.083 --> 30:47.291
in any city morgue, and
she never had a funeral.

30:48.875 --> 30:51.375
- That still doesn't
make this a murder.

30:51.458 --> 30:52.625
There's no suspect, uh--

30:52.709 --> 30:53.917
- Just wait.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.583
We haven't gotten
to the best part,

30:55.667 --> 30:57.917
the summer school teacher.

30:58.834 --> 30:59.667
Next slide.

31:00.959 --> 31:03.917
(mysterious music)

31:08.291 --> 31:10.583
Can you say quick promotion?

31:12.542 --> 31:14.542
- [Link] Well,
there's your motive.

31:14.625 --> 31:15.000
- It doesn't feel right.

31:18.041 --> 31:20.500
- Look at what
Doc is telling us.

31:20.583 --> 31:21.709
Two girls have
asked us to debunk

31:21.792 --> 31:22.834
the mystery of a
cursed classroom,

31:22.917 --> 31:25.125
and one of the girls'
mother could be

31:25.208 --> 31:27.834
the prime suspect of
a potential murder.

31:27.917 --> 31:30.208
(hisses)

31:30.291 --> 31:31.667
- I must meditate.

31:31.750 --> 31:32.625
- Guys!

31:34.041 --> 31:36.041
Wait, look what we have
on our plates here.

31:36.125 --> 31:38.875
This could be the
debunking of a century.

31:41.709 --> 31:43.250
A thousand dollars.

31:46.083 --> 31:47.208
- It's just an inquiry.

31:48.375 --> 31:49.959
No harm in checking
it out, right?

31:51.375 --> 31:52.166
- Does expulsion count as harm?

31:53.458 --> 31:55.041
- Snake...

31:56.041 --> 31:56.083
If you're out...

32:01.375 --> 32:04.000
- Is my name not Solid Snake?

32:05.625 --> 32:07.208
- All right.

32:08.625 --> 32:10.291
I'll make the phone call.

32:10.375 --> 32:12.250
(mysterious music)

32:14.625 --> 32:15.792
Hello, Heather.

32:15.875 --> 32:17.250
This is Link, CEO
of Debunkers LLC.

32:19.250 --> 32:20.458
We've conferred
amongst each other

32:20.542 --> 32:22.291
and we confidently
accept the job.

32:22.375 --> 32:23.458
We're gonna send over an invoice

32:23.542 --> 32:25.250
and a completed W-9.

32:25.333 --> 32:27.125
No, Heather, once this
mystery is solved,

32:27.208 --> 32:28.625
and it will be,

32:28.709 --> 32:30.041
you can wire transfer the
money to our accountant,

32:30.125 --> 32:33.041
Tiffany Chandler at
DebunkersLLC.com.

32:33.125 --> 32:34.917
- We have an accountant?

32:35.000 --> 32:36.333
- Fake email.

32:36.417 --> 32:39.291
Nothing more than a figment
of Link's imagination.

32:39.375 --> 32:41.125
(whispers)

32:41.208 --> 32:42.000
(scoffs)

32:42.083 --> 32:44.625
- So, Heather, how
does that sound?

32:46.625 --> 32:48.250
No, Heather.

32:49.250 --> 32:50.083
Thank you.

32:50.166 --> 32:52.959
(dramatic music)

32:56.583 --> 32:59.125
(whooshing)

32:59.208 --> 33:02.000
(Velcro tearing)

33:05.875 --> 33:08.667
(laces whipping)

33:14.291 --> 33:16.458
(crashing)

33:19.625 --> 33:20.750
(exhales deeply)

33:20.834 --> 33:21.917
- Good, lift.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.875
(dramatic music)

33:45.667 --> 33:48.792
(crickets chirping)

33:53.667 --> 33:54.083
- [Link's Dad] Ey, Sammy.

33:54.166 --> 33:55.333
(clears throat)

33:55.417 --> 33:56.917
Where you goin'?

33:57.000 --> 33:57.500
- Um, me and the guys
have got ourselves

33:57.583 --> 33:59.500
a mystery to solve, Dad.

33:59.583 --> 34:00.583
A big one.

34:00.667 --> 34:02.750
- Pick me up somethin' on
your way home, will ya?

34:02.834 --> 34:05.500
(somber music)

34:07.792 --> 34:08.625
Champ?

34:10.708 --> 34:13.291
- You can do it yourself.

34:13.375 --> 34:13.417
- Sammy.

34:14.625 --> 34:17.000
Sam.

34:17.083 --> 34:19.667
(somber music)

34:27.333 --> 34:29.542
(crickets chirping)

34:29.625 --> 34:33.166
(bikes creaking)

34:38.208 --> 34:40.917
(ominous music)

34:48.417 --> 34:51.208
(wind whistling)

34:51.291 --> 34:53.667
(jazz music)

35:01.750 --> 35:02.417
- Phase one, completed.

35:04.166 --> 35:05.667
- You're a natural, Sheik.

35:05.750 --> 35:06.375
- Thanks, Doc.

35:06.458 --> 35:07.667
- Yeah, not bad for a girl.

35:07.750 --> 35:09.000
- Hey. Shh.

35:09.083 --> 35:09.583
Enough.

35:09.667 --> 35:11.250
What's next?

35:13.000 --> 35:15.375
- They keep this place
sealed up tight at night.

35:15.458 --> 35:19.834
Security will be patrolling,
CCTV cameras rolling,

35:19.917 --> 35:23.834
motion detecting lights, and
a plethora of other obstacles.

35:23.917 --> 35:24.750
But...

35:25.959 --> 35:26.875
Here's my plan.

35:28.750 --> 35:31.291
(thrilling music)

35:31.375 --> 35:34.291
First, I pick the lock of
the Attendance building

35:34.375 --> 35:35.875
and roll in unseen.

35:35.959 --> 35:37.458
(thrilling music)

35:37.542 --> 35:40.250
(lock clicks)

35:40.333 --> 35:41.417
Cartwheel. Ha.

35:43.709 --> 35:45.959
Old Glory, God bless America.

35:47.542 --> 35:50.208
There will be a
security camera which...

35:50.291 --> 35:51.875
I'll swiftly evade.

35:51.959 --> 35:54.875
(thrilling music)

35:54.959 --> 35:55.750
(grunts)

35:55.834 --> 35:57.500
Then I'll engage
security guard one.

35:57.583 --> 35:59.333
(grunts)

35:59.417 --> 36:00.542
And eliminate quietly.

36:02.500 --> 36:03.875
Sweet dreams.

36:03.959 --> 36:04.542
(thrilling music)

36:04.625 --> 36:06.875
(whooshing)

36:06.959 --> 36:07.834
Then my friends
will join around me

36:07.917 --> 36:10.125
as we walk in a
formation down a foyer.

36:10.208 --> 36:13.041
(thrilling music)

36:16.500 --> 36:16.917
- You hear that.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.542
- Check it out.

36:19.625 --> 36:19.917
- Why don't you go check it out?

36:20.000 --> 36:21.625
(whistles)

36:21.709 --> 36:23.125
(speaking foreign language)

36:23.208 --> 36:23.917
- Link will plant the
noise distractions,

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
and I jump in with the hypnosis.

36:26.083 --> 36:29.875
Reach into your cargo shorts.

36:29.959 --> 36:30.959
Give me your keys.

36:32.333 --> 36:36.458
Then find a corner of the
library and take a nap.

36:40.750 --> 36:41.792
Thank you.

36:41.875 --> 36:42.709
(hisses)

36:42.792 --> 36:45.667
(thrilling music)

36:45.750 --> 36:48.083
Then I'll be able to let
you guys in the east gate,

36:48.166 --> 36:49.542
by the rose garden.

36:49.625 --> 36:50.041
(keys jangle)

36:50.125 --> 36:52.333
(thrilling music)

36:52.417 --> 36:54.917
(lock clicks)

36:56.917 --> 36:59.083
(shouts)

37:03.125 --> 37:05.792
Then the rest is slip and slide.

37:06.792 --> 37:09.709
(thrilling music)

37:23.125 --> 37:24.458
Then we conduct our procedures,

37:24.542 --> 37:26.250
examine the evidence,
crunch the numbers,

37:26.333 --> 37:28.959
solve the case, receive
our award, and...

37:30.083 --> 37:31.625
(paper rustles)

37:31.709 --> 37:34.333
live happily ever after.

37:34.417 --> 37:37.166
(dramatic music)

37:40.083 --> 37:41.417
- Brilliant work, Snake.

37:43.417 --> 37:44.458
Let's discuss a raise.

37:46.333 --> 37:48.667
(crickets chirping)

37:48.750 --> 37:50.000
- Oh no.

37:50.083 --> 37:50.625
- What, Sheik?

37:50.709 --> 37:52.375
- [Doc] What's wrong.

37:52.458 --> 37:55.750
- I, um, kinda messed up.

37:57.667 --> 38:00.000
- You forgot to open up the
checking account, didn't you?

38:00.083 --> 38:01.834
- Oh no.
- Link, it's fine.

38:01.917 --> 38:02.375
We have to complete the mission.

38:02.458 --> 38:03.959
- No, it's not fine.

38:06.208 --> 38:07.583
If this account isn't set up,

38:07.667 --> 38:08.583
this whole thing is for nothing.

38:08.667 --> 38:09.458
- You're right.

38:09.542 --> 38:11.667
This is all my fault.

38:11.750 --> 38:12.542
I'm gonna make it right.

38:12.625 --> 38:13.000
I'm gonna go now.

38:13.083 --> 38:14.542
- W-wait, now?

38:14.625 --> 38:14.667
- Yes, now.

38:17.041 --> 38:18.750
I won't let you down again.

38:18.834 --> 38:20.041
- Yeah.

38:20.125 --> 38:21.250
Yeah, good.

38:21.333 --> 38:22.834
Go find out where
our banker lives.

38:22.917 --> 38:24.041
Put that envelope
at his front door

38:24.125 --> 38:24.750
so he will see it
first thing tomorrow.

38:24.834 --> 38:26.500
- Yes, boss.

38:27.709 --> 38:27.750
Good luck, boys.

38:30.333 --> 38:31.375
- Link?

38:31.458 --> 38:32.041
Why don't you go--
- What are you do...

38:32.125 --> 38:34.250
That's the smell of fear.

38:37.667 --> 38:40.041
- You don't think
she's scared, do you?

38:40.125 --> 38:40.458
- She's just an intern.

38:42.417 --> 38:44.166
We expected too much
of her too soon.

38:45.125 --> 38:46.291
- This is my fault.

38:46.375 --> 38:47.709
- It's not your fault.

38:47.792 --> 38:48.333
The table is set.

38:48.417 --> 38:50.625
It's time to strike now.

38:50.709 --> 38:52.000
- Snake's right.

38:52.083 --> 38:54.291
Keep with the Debunker code.

38:54.375 --> 38:55.250
Duty.

38:57.166 --> 38:58.750
- Honor.

38:58.834 --> 39:00.083
- [Snake] Courage.

39:00.166 --> 39:02.166
- [All Three] Cashflow.

39:02.250 --> 39:03.125
- On one.

39:04.417 --> 39:06.542
(slurping)

39:07.750 --> 39:10.500
(mysterious music)

39:13.750 --> 39:16.166
(mumbling)

39:16.250 --> 39:17.583
- [Snake] Apply slight pressure,

39:17.667 --> 39:19.083
insure pick at top of lock while

39:19.166 --> 39:20.875
applying slight torque.

39:20.959 --> 39:21.750
(mumbling)

39:21.834 --> 39:24.083
Pick back and forth
in the key hole.

39:24.166 --> 39:26.041
Repeat until all pins are--

39:26.125 --> 39:27.834
- Psst, you need help?

39:27.917 --> 39:28.500
- [Snake] I got it!

39:30.500 --> 39:31.667
Repeat until all pins...

39:33.083 --> 39:36.750
(toothpick snaps)

39:38.000 --> 39:39.625
Huh. Hm.

39:42.583 --> 39:43.959
(door opens)
(muffled pop music)

39:44.041 --> 39:47.458
(door creaks)

39:47.542 --> 39:49.667
(crickets chirping)

40:00.458 --> 40:02.500
(mysterious music)

40:04.917 --> 40:08.208
(door creaks)

40:08.291 --> 40:11.625
(door stopper clatters)

40:50.583 --> 40:51.208
- Okay, guys.

40:51.291 --> 40:54.291
It says here that if we continue

40:54.375 --> 40:57.417
through the theater
shop to the stage,

40:57.500 --> 40:59.041
all we have to do is
exit through the...

40:59.125 --> 41:02.083
(gasps softly)

41:02.166 --> 41:04.500
(distant thud)

41:04.583 --> 41:05.583
Guys?

41:05.667 --> 41:08.542
(creepy ambience)

41:09.000 --> 41:10.583
Oh god.

41:13.583 --> 41:14.458
Link.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.625
Snake?

41:18.750 --> 41:18.792
Oh god.

41:20.750 --> 41:24.000
You guys better not be
pullin' a fast one on me.

41:25.291 --> 41:27.208
I'll never forgive you for it.

41:29.709 --> 41:30.625
(breathing heavily)

41:30.709 --> 41:34.083
You guys know that I'm
not supposed to be--

41:34.166 --> 41:35.000
(roaring)

41:35.083 --> 41:37.625
(screams)

41:37.709 --> 41:38.208
(sobbing)

41:38.291 --> 41:40.333
I'm too young to die!

41:40.417 --> 41:42.041
(sobbing)

41:42.125 --> 41:44.917
(shouting)

41:45.000 --> 41:47.542
(hisses)
(whimpering)

41:47.625 --> 41:48.750
- Get a hold of yourself, man.

41:48.834 --> 41:50.417
- [Doc] I think I
had a heart attack.

41:50.500 --> 41:51.542
- [Snake] You're fine.

41:51.625 --> 41:51.875
(sighs)

41:51.959 --> 41:53.750
(groans)

41:53.834 --> 41:55.458
It's time to get serious.

41:55.542 --> 41:56.000
This is just the beginning.

41:56.083 --> 41:58.917
(shudders)

41:59.000 --> 42:01.375
- I think we just found
our way out to the stage.

42:10.583 --> 42:12.417
- Stay away from the light.

42:12.500 --> 42:15.083
(somber music)

42:19.542 --> 42:20.417
- [Link] Did I
ever tell you guys

42:20.500 --> 42:23.750
I always wanted to be an actor.

42:23.834 --> 42:24.291
- No, you didn't.

42:24.375 --> 42:25.709
And we don't care.

42:25.792 --> 42:29.667
- The roaring of the crowd
after a funny monologue,

42:29.750 --> 42:31.834
or gentle sniffles after
a moving soliloquies.

42:34.583 --> 42:37.625
One day how I will
find you glory,

42:38.834 --> 42:42.333
and I will have my hands
outstretched to embrace you.

42:42.417 --> 42:43.834
- Hey, you.
- Shh.

42:45.792 --> 42:47.458
- How did you get in here?

42:47.542 --> 42:50.000
There's no students
allowed after--

42:50.083 --> 42:51.792
- I have been
caught trespassing,

42:51.875 --> 42:53.500
and I am breaking the rules.

42:54.375 --> 42:54.750
Take me in, if you must.

42:57.583 --> 42:59.375
But first let me ask you.

43:00.709 --> 43:02.417
Do you persecute the determined?

43:05.083 --> 43:05.792
It's always been my dream to

43:05.875 --> 43:08.333
make the lead of
the school play.

43:08.417 --> 43:09.458
Auditions are coming up and,

43:09.542 --> 43:11.500
honestly, uh, I just wanted to

43:11.583 --> 43:13.333
get ahead with a
little practice.

43:15.625 --> 43:18.458
My father would
disown me if he knew.

43:19.583 --> 43:20.709
That's why I can't practice
this at home, you see.

43:22.917 --> 43:25.542
(somber music)

43:31.917 --> 43:34.917
- I know exactly what you mean.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.667
I always wanted to be a dancer.

43:36.750 --> 43:38.333
But my father forbade me.

43:40.417 --> 43:42.750
- We fight the same battle
in the war of passion.

43:44.250 --> 43:45.166
- Now you listen, son.

43:45.250 --> 43:48.000
Don't be like me.

43:48.083 --> 43:50.041
Don't throw away your dreams.

43:50.125 --> 43:52.375
Now, you stay here as
long as you'd like,

43:52.458 --> 43:54.125
and you practice like
there's no tomorrow.

43:54.208 --> 43:55.959
Because--

43:56.041 --> 43:56.750
- There may not be a tomorrow.

43:58.709 --> 44:01.291
(somber music)

44:05.750 --> 44:06.959
- Break a leg, son.

44:11.250 --> 44:14.125
(sighs)

44:14.208 --> 44:16.208
(grunts)

44:16.291 --> 44:18.709
(whistles)

44:20.959 --> 44:22.583
- He's an actor.

44:22.667 --> 44:25.709
(mysterious music)

44:43.917 --> 44:45.083
(sighs)

44:45.166 --> 44:47.250
- What were you thinking?

44:47.333 --> 44:49.375
You almost blew
this entire mission.

44:49.458 --> 44:50.333
- [Link] Yeah, but I didn't.

44:50.417 --> 44:51.291
Did you see how I
handled that in there?

44:51.375 --> 44:53.542
- [Snake] You were lucky.

44:53.625 --> 44:54.667
- [Link] No, I knew
what I was doing.

44:54.750 --> 44:55.917
- [Doc] That monologue.

44:56.000 --> 44:58.250
Link, where did it come from?

44:58.333 --> 44:59.750
I mean, look, we
know some things

44:59.834 --> 45:00.667
have been going on at home,

45:00.750 --> 45:02.125
but is there, maybe, anything--

45:02.208 --> 45:04.250
- [Snake] What Dr.
Mario is trying to say

45:04.333 --> 45:07.375
is we're supposed to be a team.

45:07.458 --> 45:08.291
What are we really
doing this for?

45:08.375 --> 45:09.875
Huh?

45:09.959 --> 45:11.792
You always lecture
us that we're this

45:11.875 --> 45:13.792
company about the truth.

45:13.875 --> 45:17.250
Well, as VP of
Clandestine Maneuvers,

45:17.333 --> 45:20.375
I can tell you there
is something hidden
behind those eyes.

45:20.458 --> 45:20.959
- [Doc] Snake.

45:21.041 --> 45:22.959
Maybe calm down a bit.

45:23.041 --> 45:26.250
- I'm fine with getting
expelled from high school.

45:26.333 --> 45:28.458
But if it happens, I
just wanna know why.

45:28.542 --> 45:30.959
You don't really
believe in this mission.

45:31.041 --> 45:31.083
Do you?

45:32.458 --> 45:34.875
- How could you say that?

45:34.959 --> 45:37.709
- Because you're not
being a true Debunker.

45:37.792 --> 45:39.792
You're selling out for a
petty thousand dollars.

45:39.875 --> 45:41.458
Off again, hunting down fortune

45:41.542 --> 45:43.625
and glory over justice.

45:43.709 --> 45:44.917
- Snake, that's enough.
(snake hisses)

45:45.000 --> 45:46.500
- I am trying to keep
this company afloat.

45:46.583 --> 45:47.500
- Hm.

45:47.583 --> 45:49.917
- Tell me what really
happened then, huh?

45:50.000 --> 45:50.625
Tell me, Snake.

45:50.709 --> 45:52.625
Tell me what we've been reading,

45:52.709 --> 45:54.166
and hearing, and
seeing, and then tell me

45:54.250 --> 45:56.667
that there's nothing
mysterious about classroom E12.

45:56.750 --> 45:57.834
- You're not being honest.

45:57.917 --> 46:01.083
- Newsflash, neither is
the rest of the world.

46:07.208 --> 46:07.667
- I think we should split up.

46:07.750 --> 46:09.542
- Uh, I don't think

46:09.625 --> 46:11.917
that's the best idea.
- You're right.

46:12.000 --> 46:12.041
We should split up?

46:14.333 --> 46:16.375
If we're caught together,
our alibi becomes weak.

46:17.750 --> 46:18.709
The objective is to get to E12.

46:18.792 --> 46:20.875
No matter what
happens, we meet there.

46:25.750 --> 46:27.083
- I agree.

46:27.166 --> 46:29.125
- Uh, well maybe, I could
split up with one of you guys.

46:29.208 --> 46:30.500
- It'll be all right, Doc.

46:31.792 --> 46:32.709
I believe in you.

46:34.083 --> 46:35.458
You can do this.

46:35.542 --> 46:37.625
(sighs)

46:39.458 --> 46:42.333
(thrilling music)

46:46.417 --> 46:50.166
(digital whirring)

46:59.542 --> 47:02.458
(digital pinging)

47:10.125 --> 47:11.250
(grunts)

47:11.333 --> 47:13.041
- Dear diary,

47:14.083 --> 47:15.667
location squandered.

47:15.750 --> 47:18.583
My target lies two
clicks behind me,

47:18.667 --> 47:20.208
but two bogies sit in the way,

47:20.291 --> 47:22.500
and the path is treacherous.

47:22.583 --> 47:24.750
I could turn around and
find another port of entry,

47:24.834 --> 47:25.458
but is that who I am?

47:25.542 --> 47:28.917
Someone who turns around.

47:31.208 --> 47:34.041
Someone who turns around.

47:35.417 --> 47:36.625
Ha.

47:36.709 --> 47:37.959
You're right.

47:38.041 --> 47:39.750
The answer lies within.

47:39.834 --> 47:41.333
I must meditate.

47:41.417 --> 47:43.041
(exhales sharply)

47:43.125 --> 47:44.792
(moaning)

47:44.875 --> 47:49.125
(mysterious music)
(crickets chirping)

47:57.500 --> 47:59.959
- Rats.

48:00.041 --> 48:01.208
Drug smugglers.

48:02.375 --> 48:03.125
Late night deal, eh?

48:05.834 --> 48:07.625
This is a major
decision moment, Link.

48:09.000 --> 48:10.542
You can either move forward,

48:10.625 --> 48:12.709
remain ignorant, and
complete the mission,

48:13.875 --> 48:16.542
or make the world a better
safer place with less cons.

48:18.291 --> 48:20.625
(mysterious music)

48:20.709 --> 48:21.792
No.

48:21.875 --> 48:24.041
(cellphone chiming)

48:26.166 --> 48:28.417
(cellphone vibrating)

48:28.500 --> 48:31.458
(scoffs)

48:32.375 --> 48:33.500
Sheik, are you crazy?

48:33.583 --> 48:35.250
You almost just blew
the whole mission.

48:35.333 --> 48:36.625
- [Sheik] Sorry, um,
I thought you would've

48:36.709 --> 48:39.125
silenced your cellphone
on an assignment.

48:39.208 --> 48:40.667
- What's going on?

48:40.750 --> 48:43.000
- [Sheik] I'm outside the
house, but there's a gate.

48:43.083 --> 48:44.583
- So, climb over it.

48:44.667 --> 48:46.166
- [Sheik] Seriously?

48:46.250 --> 48:48.083
- Is this why you called me?

48:48.166 --> 48:50.875
- So how's it all going?
- Oh my god.

48:50.959 --> 48:51.834
Um, we just split up.

48:51.917 --> 48:53.041
Things are going to plan.

48:53.125 --> 48:54.834
We should be at building
E within the half hour.

48:54.917 --> 48:57.208
- [Sheik] Okay, um,
sending good wishes.

48:57.291 --> 48:57.709
Bye.

48:57.792 --> 48:59.166
- Unbelievable.

48:59.709 --> 49:03.375
(mysterious music)

49:18.834 --> 49:20.000
- Oh god.

49:21.083 --> 49:22.959
Why are you doing
this, Dr. Mario?

49:23.709 --> 49:25.125
Why couldn't you just have done

49:25.208 --> 49:26.250
a pet sitting job,
like Mom told you?

49:28.083 --> 49:29.500
Oh god, it's dark in here.

49:29.583 --> 49:30.709
Okay.

49:30.792 --> 49:33.208
Go to your happy place.

49:33.291 --> 49:33.542
Ignore your emotions.

49:33.625 --> 49:34.291
(gasps)

49:34.375 --> 49:35.542
Crap.

49:35.625 --> 49:39.083
(ominous music)

49:45.166 --> 49:46.041
Oh.

49:46.792 --> 49:49.500
(ominous music)

50:01.417 --> 50:04.125
(breathing heavily)

50:04.208 --> 50:05.500
You can do this.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.750
- So you really thought
you could get away with it.

50:21.333 --> 50:22.875
Do you have any idea who I am?

50:23.875 --> 50:24.750
Do you know the
pain that I could

50:24.834 --> 50:26.208
cause you and your family?

50:26.291 --> 50:28.208
I did it before, and
I can do it again.

50:30.291 --> 50:33.125
(ominous music)

50:33.208 --> 50:34.625
- Oh my god.

50:34.709 --> 50:35.125
You were right.

50:35.208 --> 50:35.750
She's a killer.

50:35.834 --> 50:37.625
A cold blooded killer.

50:37.709 --> 50:41.250
(ominous music)

50:41.333 --> 50:44.208
(breathing heavily)

50:44.291 --> 50:45.333
(mumbles)

50:45.417 --> 50:46.417
Link, is a...

50:50.542 --> 50:53.208
(whimpering)

50:53.291 --> 50:55.625
(breathing heavily)

50:55.709 --> 50:59.583
(suspenseful music)

51:03.750 --> 51:04.542
Go on.

51:05.709 --> 51:07.792
Open it.

51:07.875 --> 51:10.917
(suspenseful music)

51:13.667 --> 51:14.709
- [Principal Barkley]
May I help you?

51:14.792 --> 51:17.291
- Principal Barkley.

51:17.375 --> 51:18.500
Oh, it's Monday.

51:18.583 --> 51:20.500
Sorry, I forgot.
- Yes.

51:20.583 --> 51:21.333
(chuckles)
- Carry on.

51:21.417 --> 51:22.208
- Thank you. Good night.

51:24.208 --> 51:26.667
- You know, if you've
ever wanted any help,

51:26.750 --> 51:29.458
I will always--
- I will keep that in mind.

51:29.542 --> 51:30.375
Thank you.

51:33.875 --> 51:36.583
(thrilling music)

51:36.667 --> 51:39.917
(head whooshes)

51:40.000 --> 51:41.500
- You got any sixes?

51:41.583 --> 51:42.542
- Go fish.

51:43.125 --> 51:44.959
- You sure about that?

51:45.750 --> 51:46.583
- No sixes.

51:46.667 --> 51:48.000
(thrilling music)

51:48.083 --> 51:49.583
(mumbling)

51:49.667 --> 51:50.542
- Think.

51:51.792 --> 51:52.792
What would the greats
be doing right now

51:52.875 --> 51:53.834
if they were you?

51:54.417 --> 51:56.208
What is your method?

51:56.291 --> 51:58.834
(somber music)

52:01.917 --> 52:03.709
Who even are you, Link?

52:03.792 --> 52:04.834
Sherlock has his mind palace.

52:04.917 --> 52:07.583
Spade has crass intelligence.

52:07.667 --> 52:08.458
Colombo's got wits.

52:10.834 --> 52:13.166
What will your legacy be?

52:14.792 --> 52:18.458
(thrilling music)

52:21.291 --> 52:24.041
(whimpers)

52:24.125 --> 52:26.875
(box thumps)

52:26.959 --> 52:28.333
- Phase one completed.

52:28.959 --> 52:30.917
Initiating phase two.

52:31.000 --> 52:33.917
(exhales sharply)

52:35.583 --> 52:37.583
- Oh.

52:37.667 --> 52:39.750
- And the three horns
are representative

52:39.834 --> 52:43.291
of love, devotion,
and spirituality.

52:43.375 --> 52:45.917
- Well my maiden last
name was Ignatovich.

52:46.000 --> 52:47.625
- Oh.
- So they called me Iggy.

52:47.709 --> 52:48.709
(laughs)
And I had a brother...

52:48.792 --> 52:52.500
(thrilling music)

52:54.834 --> 52:57.750
(grunts)

52:59.834 --> 53:02.750
- No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no.

53:02.834 --> 53:05.667
(thrilling music)

53:10.125 --> 53:11.875
- Snake, Snake.
- Doc.

53:12.458 --> 53:13.709
(breathing heavily)

53:13.792 --> 53:14.125
- Ah, we all made it.

53:14.208 --> 53:14.917
- You guys.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.250
You won't believe what I saw.

53:17.333 --> 53:19.166
- Breath, Doc, breath.

53:19.250 --> 53:20.458
(gasping)

53:20.542 --> 53:22.291
- I did it before,
and I can do it again!

53:24.041 --> 53:25.333
(gasping)

53:27.375 --> 53:29.083
- Oh, good heavens.

53:29.166 --> 53:30.291
She's a monster.

53:31.500 --> 53:32.875
A blood sucking monster.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.583
My apologies, Link.

53:42.667 --> 53:43.625
You were right.

53:43.709 --> 53:45.875
There seems to be some
truth to this, after all,

53:45.959 --> 53:48.000
this whole ordeal.

53:48.083 --> 53:48.625
I was wrong.

53:48.709 --> 53:49.875
(shudders)

53:49.959 --> 53:53.417
(ominous music)

53:55.750 --> 53:58.125
- No, no one is right or wrong.

53:59.959 --> 54:02.458
This just means we
can't give up now.

54:02.542 --> 54:03.375
Time is of the essence.

54:03.458 --> 54:05.792
The sooner we can
solve this mystery,

54:05.875 --> 54:07.166
the sooner we can
find the proof to put

54:07.250 --> 54:08.458
that evil woman behind bars

54:08.542 --> 54:09.500
so she can no longer
do the world harm.

54:11.667 --> 54:14.041
It was first class
detective work, Dr. Mario.

54:14.125 --> 54:15.417
- Thanks.

54:15.500 --> 54:17.750
- And now, the final level.

54:17.834 --> 54:20.667
(dramatic music)

54:24.959 --> 54:27.041
(alarm blaring)

54:27.125 --> 54:28.000
What the hell is that?

54:28.083 --> 54:30.834
- Shoot, that's my alarm.

54:30.917 --> 54:31.625
It's been four hours.

54:31.709 --> 54:32.834
We need to take a lunch.

54:32.917 --> 54:34.333
- A lunch?

54:34.417 --> 54:35.667
- Yeah, union rules?

54:35.750 --> 54:37.208
- Yeah, we can only work
four hours at a time,

54:37.291 --> 54:38.959
and we have to take a 30
minute lunch break in between.

54:39.041 --> 54:40.166
Didn't you read the--
- Listen to yourselves.

54:40.250 --> 54:42.667
We are in the middle of
solving a crazed mystery yet.

54:42.750 --> 54:44.166
- Not to mention
breaking and entering.

54:44.250 --> 54:45.417
- We are not about to
take a 30 minute break!

54:47.458 --> 54:48.667
- Now, you guys just
don't understand

54:48.750 --> 54:49.834
what it takes to run a company.

54:49.917 --> 54:51.583
- I give up.

54:51.667 --> 54:53.125
- Snake, Snake.

54:53.208 --> 54:56.291
- You can sit and take
your 30 minute break.

54:56.375 --> 54:59.875
I'm gonna go debunk a
curse and solve a murder.

54:59.959 --> 55:01.083
Come on, Doc.

55:01.166 --> 55:02.917
- Wait, wait a minute, guys.

55:03.000 --> 55:04.875
I-I think I have a
solution to this.

55:05.375 --> 55:06.959
Let me find it.

55:07.041 --> 55:07.792
(gasps softly)

55:07.875 --> 55:09.166
Here.

55:09.250 --> 55:10.291
It says here workers
may voluntarily

55:10.375 --> 55:11.709
waive the right to a lunch,

55:11.792 --> 55:13.458
if by their own freewill.

55:13.542 --> 55:14.542
- Let me see that.
- You guys.

55:14.625 --> 55:16.583
You can't be serious.

55:16.667 --> 55:17.125
- Well, it's legit.

55:17.208 --> 55:18.875
Dr. Mario's right.

55:18.959 --> 55:20.542
Well, let me hear it then, Doc.

55:20.625 --> 55:22.208
Do you waive your right
to your lunch break?

55:22.291 --> 55:24.333
- I hereby happily
waive my right.

55:25.792 --> 55:26.208
- Seriously?

55:26.291 --> 55:27.709
- Just say it.

55:27.792 --> 55:30.208
- Yes! I waive my right!

55:30.291 --> 55:31.709
- Great, we can continue.

55:34.792 --> 55:35.959
- Has he always been like this?

55:36.041 --> 55:37.750
- Been like what?

55:39.959 --> 55:40.375
(inhales sharply)

55:40.458 --> 55:41.750
(exhales sharply)

55:41.834 --> 55:42.917
Positivity.

55:43.000 --> 55:44.792
Positivity.

55:46.333 --> 55:48.875
I am a volcano in a calm body.

55:50.750 --> 55:53.542
(mysterious music)

56:04.542 --> 56:05.542
- Stop. Look.

56:07.500 --> 56:08.041
(gasps softly)

56:08.125 --> 56:10.583
(Snake hisses)

56:13.291 --> 56:14.583
(sucking)

56:17.375 --> 56:18.250
- Blood.

56:19.041 --> 56:19.959
Old blood.

56:20.375 --> 56:21.166
- You sure?

56:21.250 --> 56:23.625
- I know blood when I taste it.

56:24.667 --> 56:24.709
- Why?

56:29.542 --> 56:32.333
Everything from here
is a potential clue.

56:32.417 --> 56:34.625
Keep your wits about you.

56:34.709 --> 56:35.667
Forward.

56:35.750 --> 56:38.458
(ominous music)

56:52.208 --> 56:53.458
- [Snake] Hold that up?

57:07.583 --> 57:09.709
- Now we're talkin'.

57:09.792 --> 57:12.417
(ominous music)

57:20.208 --> 57:21.083
- N. G.

57:22.875 --> 57:24.166
- Nina Galanosa.

57:25.166 --> 57:28.041
- Do you think we're
really equipped for this.

57:29.250 --> 57:30.250
I mean, guys, don't we
think we're a little bit

57:30.333 --> 57:33.000
out of our league here?
- We're in the jungle.

57:33.083 --> 57:35.417
(speaking a foreign language)

57:35.500 --> 57:37.375
The only way out is through.

57:38.750 --> 57:41.166
- Or we could just go
back out the way we came.

57:41.250 --> 57:43.917
- Not the time to wimp out, Doc.

57:44.000 --> 57:44.709
- I'm not a wimp.

57:47.458 --> 57:48.625
I'm not a wimp.

57:49.583 --> 57:51.583
(mysterious music)

58:00.166 --> 58:02.792
- [Snake] The stairwell's
straight up ahead.

58:02.875 --> 58:04.583
(ominous music)

58:09.583 --> 58:15.458
(owl hooting)
(crickets chirping)

58:23.709 --> 58:24.208
- Oh-oh god.

58:24.291 --> 58:27.208
- [Link] Oh, Doc.

58:27.291 --> 58:28.083
- It wasn't me.

58:28.166 --> 58:29.333
- I've smelled
this stench before.

58:29.417 --> 58:32.000
I just can't remember where.

58:32.083 --> 58:33.625
- Oh my god.
- We must be getting closer.

58:33.709 --> 58:37.417
- E12 is just on the other
side of this building.

58:37.500 --> 58:38.959
(sniffs)

58:39.041 --> 58:41.792
(mysterious music)

58:43.208 --> 58:44.166
- Wait a minute.

58:44.750 --> 58:46.291
Something's not right.

58:47.166 --> 58:50.000
The blood, the
writing, the smell.

58:50.083 --> 58:50.709
- What do you mean?

58:50.792 --> 58:52.583
It all makes perfect sense.

58:52.667 --> 58:55.583
These are the most obvious
clues I've ever seen.

59:01.208 --> 59:02.792
(chuckles softly)

59:02.875 --> 59:04.250
Okay, I see your point.

59:04.333 --> 59:07.125
(light buzzes)

59:07.208 --> 59:09.208
You guys see that?

59:09.291 --> 59:14.166
(light buzzing)
(suspenseful music)

59:14.792 --> 59:17.542
(exhales deeply)

59:19.875 --> 59:20.625
(loud cackling)
(shouting)

59:20.709 --> 59:22.417
- What the hell is that!

59:22.500 --> 59:23.625
(shouting)

59:23.709 --> 59:24.625
- Whatever it is,
don't let see us!

59:24.709 --> 59:27.375
- Guys! It's coming
from the intercom!

59:27.458 --> 59:28.333
Keep moving!

59:28.417 --> 59:31.166
(screaming)
(shouting)

59:31.250 --> 59:32.500
- That's what you are!

59:32.583 --> 59:33.959
Reveal thyself!

59:34.041 --> 59:34.792
(laughs maniacally)

59:34.875 --> 59:35.625
I live for this!

59:35.709 --> 59:36.542
- Snake, what are you doing?

59:36.625 --> 59:37.750
You're gonna get us killed!

59:37.834 --> 59:38.333
- It's evil, Doc.

59:38.417 --> 59:41.458
That's fear, real fear !

59:41.542 --> 59:43.041
(laughing maniacally)

59:43.125 --> 59:44.542
- Go, go, go!

59:44.625 --> 59:45.208
(distant cackling)

59:45.291 --> 59:48.125
Guys, the classroom.

59:48.208 --> 59:49.834
- Home run! Huzzah!

59:49.917 --> 59:51.291
- Oh god!

59:51.375 --> 59:53.542
(whimpering)

59:53.625 --> 59:56.166
(shouts)
(screams)

59:56.250 --> 59:59.417
(laughing)

01:00:01.417 --> 01:00:02.750
- Oh my god.

01:00:02.834 --> 01:00:04.333
It's even better than I
could've possibly imagined.

01:00:04.417 --> 01:00:06.333
[Clark] Oh, man,
he peed himself.

01:00:06.417 --> 01:00:07.542
- He peed himself?

01:00:07.625 --> 01:00:08.667
- Oh, that is--
- He peed himself.

01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:09.583
Get the...
(mumbling)

01:00:09.667 --> 01:00:10.750
(laughing)
- Sorry, guys.

01:00:10.834 --> 01:00:12.750
- I bet you worms think
you're real funny.

01:00:12.834 --> 01:00:13.375
- No, but you do.

01:00:13.458 --> 01:00:16.166
Reveal thyself, spirit.

01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:17.709
- I should've known.

01:00:17.792 --> 01:00:19.834
- You did. We all did.

01:00:19.917 --> 01:00:20.834
(groans)

01:00:20.917 --> 01:00:21.291
- I don't understand.

01:00:21.375 --> 01:00:22.375
(girls laughing)

01:00:22.458 --> 01:00:25.834
- The girls?
- Mm-hm.

01:00:25.917 --> 01:00:26.667
(laughing)

01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:27.625
- The girls were lies.

01:00:27.709 --> 01:00:28.709
- Gotcha.

01:00:28.792 --> 01:00:29.583
- You mean you
guys, like, actually

01:00:29.667 --> 01:00:31.542
all believed us the whole time?

01:00:31.625 --> 01:00:34.458
- So you guys did all this?

01:00:34.542 --> 01:00:36.291
You set all of this up just...

01:00:37.458 --> 01:00:37.750
just to mock us.

01:00:40.208 --> 01:00:42.041
- Just to mock you?
- No.

01:00:42.709 --> 01:00:46.083
- Oh no. This was revenge.

01:00:47.375 --> 01:00:49.083
You don't know what I'm
talkin' about, do you?

01:00:49.166 --> 01:00:50.375
- They don't even know.
- No.

01:00:50.458 --> 01:00:53.166
- Last year, you
three twerps ruined

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:55.458
what would've been the
greatest senior prank

01:00:55.542 --> 01:00:57.375
this school has ever seen.

01:00:57.458 --> 01:00:58.291
(cellphones chiming)
(students laughing)

01:00:58.375 --> 01:00:59.583
Do you have any idea
the organization

01:00:59.667 --> 01:01:02.041
it took me to get
every single senior

01:01:02.125 --> 01:01:05.875
to set their alarm to 12:01
and leave it in their lockers?

01:01:05.959 --> 01:01:07.375
You told the principal.

01:01:07.458 --> 01:01:08.750
And once he found out
it was me and Clark,

01:01:08.834 --> 01:01:10.041
we were suspended.

01:01:10.125 --> 01:01:12.208
And now we're
repeating senior year.

01:01:12.291 --> 01:01:12.917
I mean, hell, I'm
gonna throw another

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.333
20 TDs to this guys this season.

01:01:16.250 --> 01:01:17.125
- That's my boy. (giggles)

01:01:17.208 --> 01:01:20.375
- But you just provided
us with, easily,

01:01:20.458 --> 01:01:21.709
a years worth of entertainment.

01:01:21.792 --> 01:01:24.166
I mean, I mean, the shirts?

01:01:24.250 --> 01:01:24.583
- The flyers.

01:01:24.667 --> 01:01:26.083
(laughing)

01:01:26.166 --> 01:01:27.375
- The flyers, the company?

01:01:27.458 --> 01:01:28.083
Thank you.
(sighs)

01:01:28.166 --> 01:01:30.417
That was a real gift for us.

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:31.083
- Yeah, yeah, Christmas can't

01:01:31.166 --> 01:01:31.583
even beat this.
- Yeah.

01:01:31.667 --> 01:01:33.583
- Or New Years.

01:01:33.667 --> 01:01:34.583
And I love me some New Years.
- We love New Years.

01:01:34.667 --> 01:01:35.625
- Nor.
- We do.

01:01:35.709 --> 01:01:37.166
- Huh?

01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:40.083
- That would be nor New
Years, you delinquent.

01:01:41.583 --> 01:01:43.125
- Oh, look who decided to
be a smart little teenager.

01:01:43.208 --> 01:01:44.583
(screaming)

01:01:44.667 --> 01:01:46.417
- Okay.
- It's not worth it, Snake.

01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:47.083
- [Joyce] Oh.

01:01:47.166 --> 01:01:48.458
- You should listen to your

01:01:48.542 --> 01:01:49.375
friends, Snake.
- Almost scary.

01:01:49.458 --> 01:01:50.208
(hisses)
- Okay, guys, that's enough.

01:01:50.291 --> 01:01:51.583
They get it.

01:01:51.667 --> 01:01:52.750
- I trusted you.

01:01:52.834 --> 01:01:53.834
- Oh-ho.
(laughing)

01:01:53.917 --> 01:01:55.208
Oh my god.
- Trusted.

01:01:55.291 --> 01:01:56.250
- No, no, no.

01:01:56.333 --> 01:01:57.542
No, check this out.

01:01:57.625 --> 01:01:59.792
Little pee-pee pants
got a crush on my girl.

01:01:59.875 --> 01:02:00.667
Ooh.
(chuckling)

01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:01.583
Guess what?

01:02:01.667 --> 01:02:03.125
The real fun starts tomorrow.

01:02:03.208 --> 01:02:05.959
When we show the whole school
who Debunkers Co really is.

01:02:06.041 --> 01:02:07.667
- It's Debunkers LLC.
- Okay.

01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:08.583
- No one knows what--
- What does it even

01:02:08.667 --> 01:02:09.458
stand for?
- that means.

01:02:09.542 --> 01:02:10.083
- All right!

01:02:10.166 --> 01:02:11.458
- Doesn't make any sense.

01:02:12.583 --> 01:02:13.375
- You guys wanna ruin our
lives at this high school?

01:02:13.458 --> 01:02:15.500
- Yeah, we do.
- Yeah.

01:02:15.583 --> 01:02:16.083
- I think we just did.
- We really do.

01:02:16.166 --> 01:02:17.041
- Fine!

01:02:17.667 --> 01:02:19.792
Okay, we accept our fate.

01:02:21.208 --> 01:02:23.041
Now can I at least
ask some questions?

01:02:23.125 --> 01:02:25.291
- Ooh, he wants to
know how we did it.

01:02:25.375 --> 01:02:27.041
- We already know
how you did it.

01:02:27.125 --> 01:02:28.083
- Obviously, you got
the keys to the school

01:02:28.166 --> 01:02:30.583
from Heather's mom and
got in without a problem.

01:02:30.667 --> 01:02:31.458
- That's right.

01:02:31.542 --> 01:02:33.041
- That was us.
- One of you

01:02:33.125 --> 01:02:34.000
did the invisible ink, and
then you probably recorded

01:02:34.083 --> 01:02:36.125
sounds and played them over
(howling)

01:02:36.208 --> 01:02:37.542
the intercom speaker, which
you would've had access to

01:02:37.625 --> 01:02:38.959
via the principal's room.
(growling)

01:02:39.041 --> 01:02:41.792
Simple fog machine under the
classroom door, and uh...

01:02:41.875 --> 01:02:43.542
- Hydrolated ammonium sulfate.

01:02:43.625 --> 01:02:44.667
- Ooh.
- Uh.

01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:46.667
- A fart bomb.
- Oh, all right.

01:02:46.750 --> 01:02:48.083
- For the smell of death.

01:02:48.166 --> 01:02:50.291
I knew I'd smelt that before.

01:02:50.375 --> 01:02:53.000
- Great job, Einstein.
(muttering)

01:02:53.083 --> 01:02:54.959
- And the writing on the walls.

01:02:55.041 --> 01:02:57.500
Recently graffitied, still wet.

01:02:57.583 --> 01:02:58.500
- [Doc] Childish.

01:02:58.583 --> 01:03:00.208
- Yeah, sorta like peeing

01:03:00.291 --> 01:03:01.917
your pants.
- Peeing your pants?

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:02.834
- I still don't understand.

01:03:02.917 --> 01:03:05.834
I saw Principal
Barkley in her office

01:03:05.917 --> 01:03:07.041
with someone else,

01:03:07.125 --> 01:03:08.083
and she was in
the middle of ta--

01:03:08.166 --> 01:03:09.291
- Ugh.
- Boredom.

01:03:09.375 --> 01:03:10.166
Just then.
- Falling asleep.

01:03:10.250 --> 01:03:11.500
- Me too.

01:03:11.583 --> 01:03:12.166
(laughing)
- Let's go to Sylvia's party.

01:03:12.250 --> 01:03:13.375
- Let's do it.
- Yeah.

01:03:13.458 --> 01:03:14.417
- Get home safe, Sherlocks.

01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:15.083
We did a debunking.
- Bye.

01:03:16.375 --> 01:03:17.458
- But what about the blood?

01:03:17.542 --> 01:03:18.959
(mysterious music)

01:03:19.041 --> 01:03:23.083
(groans)
(sighs)

01:03:23.166 --> 01:03:24.166
- What blood?

01:03:25.625 --> 01:03:26.333
- The blood at the entrance
of the building door.

01:03:26.417 --> 01:03:29.667
(mysterious music)

01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:31.166
- Uh, okay, guys.

01:03:31.250 --> 01:03:32.375
I think that your
imaginations are running

01:03:32.458 --> 01:03:35.041
a little too wild.

01:03:35.125 --> 01:03:36.709
- So the blood
wasn't your doing?

01:03:36.792 --> 01:03:37.875
- What blood?

01:03:37.959 --> 01:03:39.000
(loud thud)
(gasps)

01:03:39.083 --> 01:03:39.125
- [Clark] Whoa.

01:03:40.959 --> 01:03:42.166
- [Russel] Whoa.

01:03:42.250 --> 01:03:42.959
- Guys, that's enough.

01:03:43.041 --> 01:03:43.709
They get it, okay?

01:03:43.792 --> 01:03:44.291
- No, no, no, babe.

01:03:44.375 --> 01:03:46.083
This isn't us.

01:03:46.166 --> 01:03:46.583
- Do you see that?

01:03:46.667 --> 01:03:50.125
(ominous music)

01:03:50.208 --> 01:03:51.083
- Hey.

01:03:52.291 --> 01:03:54.709
- Hey, pal.

01:03:54.792 --> 01:03:55.583
Show your face.

01:03:55.667 --> 01:03:56.333
You're not scaring anybody.

01:03:56.417 --> 01:03:58.709
What the...

01:03:58.792 --> 01:04:01.250
(ominous music)

01:04:01.333 --> 01:04:01.875
Whoa! Whoa!

01:04:01.959 --> 01:04:04.333
Whoa!
(screaming)

01:04:04.417 --> 01:04:05.417
- Remember, guys, it's not real.

01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:08.208
(cackling)

01:04:08.291 --> 01:04:09.583
Okay! (mumbles)

01:04:09.667 --> 01:04:10.500
(cackling)

01:04:10.583 --> 01:04:12.750
- Somebody's gotta
be messing with us.

01:04:12.834 --> 01:04:14.125
- Okay, that was like a real,

01:04:14.208 --> 01:04:14.875
that was a real skeleton!

01:04:14.959 --> 01:04:16.875
- Th-that, that Nina Galanosa,

01:04:16.959 --> 01:04:17.834
did she really die?

01:04:17.917 --> 01:04:18.750
- I don't know.

01:04:18.834 --> 01:04:20.375
This wasn't supposed to be real.

01:04:20.458 --> 01:04:21.750
- Well, look who
decided to be smart.

01:04:21.834 --> 01:04:22.875
- Well, you saw it too, man.

01:04:22.959 --> 01:04:24.458
What am I supposed to think.

01:04:24.542 --> 01:04:25.667
- You boys know what to do.

01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:26.917
Stay to the course.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.083
- What is he...
- We've been through

01:04:28.166 --> 01:04:28.917
this before.
- What are you saying,

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:29.834
you little nerd!
- Hey!

01:04:29.917 --> 01:04:30.625
- You know the chain of com--

01:04:30.709 --> 01:04:32.083
- What's going on!

01:04:32.166 --> 01:04:32.583
- Hey, guys, stop it!
(shouting over each other)

01:04:32.667 --> 01:04:36.291
(mysterious music)

01:04:44.125 --> 01:04:46.792
- [Apparition] Taken
three weeks ago.

01:04:46.875 --> 01:04:48.500
Now I will take three of you.

01:04:48.583 --> 01:04:50.417
Who will it be?

01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:52.667
Who will it be?

01:04:54.709 --> 01:04:56.375
(shrieking)

01:04:56.458 --> 01:05:00.333
(screaming)
(creepy ambience)

01:05:00.417 --> 01:05:01.083
- Screw this!

01:05:01.166 --> 01:05:02.667
- Look out!
- I'm outta here!

01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:03.792
(shouting)
(creepy ambience)

01:05:03.875 --> 01:05:07.041
- [Apparition] Whom will it be?

01:05:07.125 --> 01:05:08.375
- Take us!

01:05:08.458 --> 01:05:10.959
Take us, and let Joyce
and Heather leave!

01:05:11.041 --> 01:05:12.458
- Go, girls.

01:05:12.542 --> 01:05:13.458
Go now, and tell everyone
what happened here today.

01:05:13.542 --> 01:05:17.083
(dramatic music)

01:05:17.166 --> 01:05:17.834
(sighs)

01:05:17.917 --> 01:05:19.041
- Thanks, Doc.

01:05:19.125 --> 01:05:21.875
(dramatic music)

01:05:21.959 --> 01:05:23.125
- Bring it on!

01:05:25.208 --> 01:05:27.250
(mysterious music)

01:05:35.041 --> 01:05:36.417
- Any ideas?

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:38.125
- Um... my time.

01:05:39.542 --> 01:05:41.083
Utility closet! Go!

01:05:41.166 --> 01:05:44.375
(thrilling music)

01:05:44.458 --> 01:05:47.125
- Let's clog that ghost up!

01:05:47.208 --> 01:05:49.000
Let me at it, I'm ready!

01:05:49.083 --> 01:05:50.125
- It's not real.

01:05:50.208 --> 01:05:51.625
Okay, it can't be.

01:05:51.709 --> 01:05:53.125
Remember guys, there was
always an explanation.

01:05:54.417 --> 01:05:56.709
Think now.

01:05:56.792 --> 01:05:58.166
We know they didn't plant
the articles online,

01:05:58.250 --> 01:05:59.125
but we all read them.

01:05:59.208 --> 01:06:03.458
We saw Barkley in
her room, but uh...

01:06:03.542 --> 01:06:05.625
- But nothing.

01:06:05.709 --> 01:06:06.750
We know it was
Principal Barkley.

01:06:06.834 --> 01:06:08.291
Heather was just trying to
get us back for Russell,

01:06:08.375 --> 01:06:11.834
when really she was exploiting
her mother's crimes.

01:06:11.917 --> 01:06:13.333
(sighs)

01:06:13.417 --> 01:06:15.041
(suspenseful music)

01:06:15.125 --> 01:06:15.250
- It wasn't Barkley.

01:06:18.375 --> 01:06:19.500
- What do you know?

01:06:19.583 --> 01:06:22.208
- After we split up, I
saw Barkley and Anderson

01:06:22.291 --> 01:06:24.834
just walking casually
down the quad.

01:06:24.917 --> 01:06:26.750
We just must've
misread something.

01:06:27.625 --> 01:06:29.709
- You knew, and
you didn't tell us?

01:06:29.792 --> 01:06:32.083
Even after we were humiliated.

01:06:33.291 --> 01:06:35.291
- Look, we needed to
continue the mission.

01:06:36.542 --> 01:06:40.417
- When this job is finished
and this mystery is debunked,

01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:44.125
I'm gonna take my cut of the
thousand dollars, and I'm out.

01:06:44.208 --> 01:06:45.250
- [Doc] No, Snake.

01:06:45.333 --> 01:06:46.500
- I can't be
working with someone

01:06:46.583 --> 01:06:49.333
who doesn't understand
what it means to trust.

01:06:49.417 --> 01:06:50.291
- Snake, you don't mean that.

01:06:50.375 --> 01:06:51.208
He doesn't mean that.

01:06:53.083 --> 01:06:53.792
Right?

01:06:53.875 --> 01:06:54.792
That...

01:06:54.875 --> 01:06:57.458
that-that he's not gonna
be a Dubunker anymore?

01:06:57.542 --> 01:06:58.458
- He's right.

01:07:00.125 --> 01:07:02.375
He shouldn't work with
someone he doesn't trust.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.125
Neither should you, Doc.

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:18.834
My dad lost his job.

01:07:21.458 --> 01:07:23.166
That's what's been
goin' on at home.

01:07:24.542 --> 01:07:25.458
He got fired, and he's just been

01:07:25.542 --> 01:07:28.542
lettin' himself slip
into oblivion ever since.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.333
All he does all day
is drinks Diet Coke

01:07:34.417 --> 01:07:37.625
and watches movies while he
withers away in his chair.

01:07:39.959 --> 01:07:42.208
And the worst part is
that I help him do it.

01:07:44.875 --> 01:07:46.166
I think I'm killin' him.

01:07:51.125 --> 01:07:52.709
I will not end up like him.

01:07:52.792 --> 01:07:53.583
All right?

01:07:53.667 --> 01:07:55.166
I'm gonna make
something of myself

01:07:55.250 --> 01:07:56.125
so I can support my
mom, so we don't have

01:07:56.208 --> 01:07:59.125
to worry about all
this surviving crap.

01:08:02.458 --> 01:08:04.250
Money is causing my dad to
want to not live anymore.

01:08:06.250 --> 01:08:07.834
Stupid freakin' money.

01:08:09.041 --> 01:08:11.083
Now that, to me, is a mystery

01:08:11.166 --> 01:08:13.375
that I will never
be able to solve.

01:08:14.417 --> 01:08:16.166
You wanna know the truth.

01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:17.709
I need to solve this mystery,

01:08:18.667 --> 01:08:19.500
no matter how thin.

01:08:20.917 --> 01:08:23.542
I need this company to succeed.

01:08:29.792 --> 01:08:30.332
I need you guys.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.082
- That's the truth?

01:08:38.082 --> 01:08:38.959
- The truth.

01:08:39.917 --> 01:08:42.457
(somber music)

01:08:47.792 --> 01:08:49.417
- Swear it?

01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:53.082
(somber music)

01:09:07.125 --> 01:09:09.917
(dramatic music)

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.834
What do we do now?

01:09:35.917 --> 01:09:36.792
- I think...

01:09:40.250 --> 01:09:41.792
Emergency board
meeting commencing now.

01:09:41.875 --> 01:09:45.417
(dramatic music)

01:09:47.166 --> 01:09:49.082
I think I might
just have a plan.

01:09:49.166 --> 01:09:51.959
(dramatic music)

01:09:58.709 --> 01:10:01.250
(screaming)

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.250
(metallic whooshing)

01:10:11.333 --> 01:10:14.208
(dramatic music)

01:10:23.458 --> 01:10:24.667
It worked.

01:10:24.750 --> 01:10:26.834
(sighs)

01:10:27.625 --> 01:10:30.500
You can come out
now, Dr. Saginov.

01:10:33.667 --> 01:10:35.083
- Ah-ha!

01:10:35.166 --> 01:10:35.917
(voice changer beeps)

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.083
- Well done.

01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:45.000
Well done, boys.

01:10:46.375 --> 01:10:46.542
- No more accent.

01:10:48.875 --> 01:10:49.709
- Nope.

01:10:51.583 --> 01:10:53.000
And that's our little secret.

01:10:53.834 --> 01:10:55.000
- You've got some
explaining to do.

01:10:55.083 --> 01:10:57.166
- What happened to Nina?

01:10:59.208 --> 01:11:00.959
- I'll make a deal
with you, boys.

01:11:01.041 --> 01:11:03.375
I'll tell you the why
if you tell me the how.

01:11:03.458 --> 01:11:06.208
- Careful, Link, you could
be talkin' to a murderer.

01:11:07.542 --> 01:11:10.917
- Okay, Saginov, we'll
play your little game.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.834
But no one's leaving here
until you prove your innocence.

01:11:17.208 --> 01:11:18.083
- Okay.

01:11:19.333 --> 01:11:20.208
You first.

01:11:21.375 --> 01:11:22.959
- Well...

01:11:23.041 --> 01:11:24.542
It's like I always
tell the guys.

01:11:25.667 --> 01:11:27.083
Smoke and mirrors.

01:11:27.166 --> 01:11:29.458
With the right mixture of
fog, a well placed mirror,

01:11:29.542 --> 01:11:31.208
and the school's
smart board projector,

01:11:31.291 --> 01:11:34.000
you made yourself a nice
homemade apparition.

01:11:34.083 --> 01:11:36.875
- Easy enough, and the rest?

01:11:36.959 --> 01:11:40.166
- Principal Barkley,
she was the MacGuffin.

01:11:40.250 --> 01:11:41.375
- When I saw her in her office,

01:11:41.458 --> 01:11:44.000
I thought she was
punishing Mr. Anderson.

01:11:44.083 --> 01:11:45.250
A ploy for power, I suspected,

01:11:45.333 --> 01:11:47.583
just like her move
on Nina Galanosa.

01:11:48.792 --> 01:11:51.375
- A simple mistake
about expectations.

01:11:51.458 --> 01:11:53.875
You see, you wanted Principal
Barkley to be the suspect,

01:11:53.959 --> 01:11:56.792
so you made up evidence
to prove that theory.

01:11:58.083 --> 01:11:58.625
What made you change your mind?

01:12:01.542 --> 01:12:04.125
- I saw Barkley and Anderson
walking down the quad together.

01:12:04.208 --> 01:12:06.875
- Through meditation,
I retraced our steps

01:12:06.959 --> 01:12:09.250
from the other day
and remembered.

01:12:09.333 --> 01:12:10.417
- Well, enjoy your
first day, gentlemen.

01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:14.000
And I will see you after
rehearsal, Heather.

01:12:16.417 --> 01:12:18.542
- Show him the video, Doc.

01:12:18.625 --> 01:12:20.667
(mysterious music)

01:12:22.959 --> 01:12:24.250
- [Doc] Scripts.

01:12:24.333 --> 01:12:25.542
- [Link] Running a scene.

01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:28.834
- Principal Barkley
wants to be an actress.

01:12:28.917 --> 01:12:31.458
Mr. Anderson was probably just
helping her run her lines.

01:12:31.542 --> 01:12:31.625
- Barkley is out.

01:12:33.959 --> 01:12:36.500
- And once Russel and
his minions didn't
mention the blood,

01:12:36.583 --> 01:12:38.375
we knew we were on to something.

01:12:39.250 --> 01:12:41.000
And how did I know it was you?

01:12:42.834 --> 01:12:44.333
- How did you know it was me?

01:12:45.250 --> 01:12:47.834
- The blood, the real blood.

01:12:47.917 --> 01:12:49.125
- I know real blood
when I taste it.

01:12:49.208 --> 01:12:50.542
- It was from a dead pig.

01:12:52.458 --> 01:12:53.917
I your science
class this morning,

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:55.500
I saw the pigs frozen for
period three dissection.

01:12:57.792 --> 01:13:01.667
Oh, by the way, the uh,
skeleton was a nice touch.

01:13:01.750 --> 01:13:02.792
Something every science teacher

01:13:02.875 --> 01:13:04.458
has in their arsenal, no doubt.

01:13:06.041 --> 01:13:07.750
But you wanna know
when I really knew?

01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:12.208
Taken three years ago, I was.

01:13:13.208 --> 01:13:15.208
It's a pretty odd way to
talk, don't you think.

01:13:15.291 --> 01:13:19.458
- Strangely similar to our
little run in this morning.

01:13:19.542 --> 01:13:22.125
- Commercial sign, no allowed.

01:13:23.208 --> 01:13:25.375
- Very perceptive.

01:13:26.333 --> 01:13:28.208
- And that still
leaves Nina Galanosa.

01:13:29.375 --> 01:13:34.208
The poor girl who never
existed in the first place.

01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:39.625
(suspenseful music)

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:42.500
- You passed.

01:13:42.583 --> 01:13:46.500
(suspenseful music)

01:13:46.583 --> 01:13:46.709
You can come in now.

01:13:50.083 --> 01:13:52.709
(gentle music)

01:13:55.083 --> 01:13:55.917
- [Doc] Sheik!

01:13:57.083 --> 01:13:59.333
- Actually, it's
Vicky, Vicky London.

01:13:59.417 --> 01:14:00.333
- But you, (laughs nervously)

01:14:00.417 --> 01:14:00.917
you, you're...

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.834
- Surprise.

01:14:02.917 --> 01:14:03.750
- You're--
- Vicky is

01:14:03.834 --> 01:14:05.375
one of our best field agents.

01:14:05.458 --> 01:14:07.166
Something of a protege.

01:14:07.250 --> 01:14:09.000
You know, she has
over 40 aliases?

01:14:09.083 --> 01:14:11.500
I'm not even sure if Vicky
London is her real name.

01:14:11.583 --> 01:14:12.500
- And you'll never know.

01:14:12.583 --> 01:14:15.875
It's been a real pleasure
working with you boys.

01:14:17.083 --> 01:14:18.959
You're an interesting
bunch, that's for sure.

01:14:19.959 --> 01:14:22.083
But capable of great things.

01:14:22.166 --> 01:14:23.917
- I knew you weren't normal.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.417
I know somethin' was off.

01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:27.917
No average girl is that
immune to my mind control.

01:14:29.291 --> 01:14:32.000
- So, are you saying
I'm not an average girl.

01:14:32.083 --> 01:14:33.834
(scoffs)

01:14:33.917 --> 01:14:36.041
- Of course.

01:14:36.125 --> 01:14:38.125
How could I have
been so clueless?

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:40.875
- Sheik.

01:14:41.834 --> 01:14:42.959
She picked Sheik!

01:14:43.959 --> 01:14:45.792
- Holy crap, she picked Sheik.

01:14:45.875 --> 01:14:48.542
- Uh, I-I'm lost.

01:14:48.625 --> 01:14:51.208
I-I still really
don't understand.

01:14:51.291 --> 01:14:52.125
- Zelda.

01:14:52.625 --> 01:14:54.333
Ocarina of time.

01:14:55.333 --> 01:14:56.458
- Of course.

01:14:56.542 --> 01:14:58.375
- You boys have some
vivid imaginations.

01:14:58.458 --> 01:15:00.375
You probably had the
whole evil murder

01:15:00.458 --> 01:15:01.792
worked out in your minds.

01:15:01.875 --> 01:15:04.417
- That imagination
will get you far,

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:05.625
but it can also
be your weakness.

01:15:05.709 --> 01:15:09.750
- Something you'll have
to work on as we continue.

01:15:11.291 --> 01:15:12.166
- We?

01:15:13.291 --> 01:15:15.375
- I think I'm starting
to understand.

01:15:15.458 --> 01:15:17.375
- So that's why you
set all this up.

01:15:17.458 --> 01:15:19.250
- So now I'll tell you the why.

01:15:19.333 --> 01:15:23.667
(mysterious music)

01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:24.583
We started small, but we've

01:15:24.667 --> 01:15:27.917
been recruiting
across the country,

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.291
and we're growing rapidly.

01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:33.041
We've been keeping an eye
on you boys for a while now.

01:15:33.125 --> 01:15:35.125
Ever since we saw your
commercial online.

01:15:40.166 --> 01:15:42.959
We only take the best
and the brightest.

01:15:43.041 --> 01:15:45.792
(mysterious music)

01:15:48.291 --> 01:15:51.125
So I sent Vicky in as a
foreign exchange student.

01:15:51.208 --> 01:15:53.041
She got to know
your inner workings,

01:15:53.125 --> 01:15:54.083
reported back to me periodically

01:15:54.166 --> 01:15:56.959
to let me know that
you have what it takes.

01:15:57.041 --> 01:15:58.458
- That day in the
hallway, I found out that

01:15:58.542 --> 01:15:59.959
Russell and his gang wanted to

01:16:00.041 --> 01:16:02.291
make a fool of you
guys for payback.

01:16:02.375 --> 01:16:04.959
So I suggested the
story of Nina Galanosa.

01:16:05.041 --> 01:16:08.166
A story that Dr.
Saginov and I invented.

01:16:10.166 --> 01:16:11.875
If you boys weren't
so distracted

01:16:11.959 --> 01:16:13.625
by your feminine interests,

01:16:13.709 --> 01:16:15.959
you may have
suspected this much.

01:16:16.041 --> 01:16:19.875
- She was my eyes and ears from
that point out for our test.

01:16:19.959 --> 01:16:22.333
My real name is
Alfred Carmichael.

01:16:23.291 --> 01:16:25.917
But the world knows
me as Igor Saginov.

01:16:27.166 --> 01:16:29.500
I too am in the
clandestine field.

01:16:29.583 --> 01:16:31.917
- He's being modest.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.291
He runs the field.

01:16:33.375 --> 01:16:34.500
- Alfred Carmichael?

01:16:35.917 --> 01:16:38.500
Like the Alfred Carmichael,

01:16:38.583 --> 01:16:39.750
who disappeared in
Chernobyl in 88?

01:16:41.625 --> 01:16:44.667
(mysterious music)

01:16:47.250 --> 01:16:48.083
- Raisin Corp?

01:16:48.166 --> 01:16:50.333
- We can't be too
obvious, now can we?

01:16:51.583 --> 01:16:53.750
I run an underground incubator,

01:16:53.834 --> 01:16:58.000
an international cohort
of skilled detectives,

01:16:58.083 --> 01:16:59.667
like Ms. London here,

01:16:59.750 --> 01:17:01.208
who have dedicated their lives

01:17:01.291 --> 01:17:04.750
to espionage and solving
mysteries, just like you.

01:17:05.709 --> 01:17:07.834
This is the big leagues,

01:17:07.917 --> 01:17:11.125
the assignments that help
keep the world safe at night.

01:17:11.208 --> 01:17:12.834
- Did I die?

01:17:12.917 --> 01:17:15.834
Did the ghost just
kill all of us?

01:17:15.917 --> 01:17:17.625
- So you were scouting us?

01:17:17.709 --> 01:17:18.709
- Yes, we both were.

01:17:18.792 --> 01:17:20.709
At first, I would have
advised against you

01:17:20.792 --> 01:17:23.625
advertising your
business so openly.

01:17:23.709 --> 01:17:25.875
But I spoke with Ms. London,

01:17:25.959 --> 01:17:26.750
and we both realized--

01:17:26.834 --> 01:17:27.333
- It's the perfect cover.

01:17:27.417 --> 01:17:29.834
- The double bluff.

01:17:29.917 --> 01:17:32.041
- I would officially
like to make Debunkers

01:17:32.125 --> 01:17:35.750
the invisible face
of mystery solving.

01:17:35.834 --> 01:17:37.917
I could provide you
with startup capital,

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.625
some resources, and skilled

01:17:39.709 --> 01:17:41.959
field agents that
will assist you.

01:17:42.041 --> 01:17:44.375
Now, you'll have to
provide some reliable

01:17:44.458 --> 01:17:45.583
alibies to your
families and keep up

01:17:45.667 --> 01:17:48.709
the facade that your business is

01:17:48.792 --> 01:17:50.250
unassuming and innocent,

01:17:50.333 --> 01:17:53.166
and run by kids with
wild imaginations.

01:17:54.333 --> 01:17:55.417
- How much startup
capital are we talking?

01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:59.667
- Say... $10,000?

01:17:59.750 --> 01:18:00.250
(chokes)

01:18:00.333 --> 01:18:02.000
- Oh my god.

01:18:02.083 --> 01:18:04.166
- So, do we have a deal?

01:18:07.166 --> 01:18:08.000
- Take it.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:18:08.083 --> 01:18:09.291
- We do, yeah.
- Take it.

01:18:09.375 --> 01:18:10.417
Take the money.

01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:10.917
Take the money.

01:18:17.375 --> 01:18:20.625
- Oh, and by the way...

01:18:21.792 --> 01:18:23.417
Let's make you guys legitimate.

01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:24.083
Drop that LLC.

01:18:24.166 --> 01:18:26.542
Let's make it Incorporated.

01:18:30.417 --> 01:18:33.792
- Debunkers Incorporated.

01:18:33.875 --> 01:18:35.083
- Well done, boys.

01:18:36.208 --> 01:18:37.125
You passed.

01:18:38.333 --> 01:18:41.125
- I can't believe I let
a spy into our office.

01:18:41.208 --> 01:18:43.625
- Will you forgive me
for being deceptive?

01:18:43.709 --> 01:18:43.875
- You're Sheik now.

01:18:45.542 --> 01:18:45.959
You'll always be Sheik.

01:18:49.250 --> 01:18:51.208
A true Debunker.

01:18:53.083 --> 01:18:55.667
- So, will I see you at home?

01:18:57.959 --> 01:18:58.583
- I told your
parents my father is

01:18:58.667 --> 01:19:01.458
having surgery in Calgary.

01:19:01.542 --> 01:19:02.458
A white lie.

01:19:03.917 --> 01:19:05.667
Tell them thank
you again for me.

01:19:06.417 --> 01:19:09.083
- So this is goodbye.

01:19:11.542 --> 01:19:12.417
- No.

01:19:13.959 --> 01:19:16.000
This is hello.

01:19:16.083 --> 01:19:18.875
(mysterious music)

01:19:21.917 --> 01:19:24.291
(door opens)

01:19:25.583 --> 01:19:28.083
(door closes)

01:19:33.125 --> 01:19:34.125
- What in the world?

01:19:37.208 --> 01:19:39.083
- Got a plan for this one?

01:19:39.166 --> 01:19:41.500
- Um... (clicks tongue) run.

01:19:41.583 --> 01:19:42.875
(suspenseful music)
- Hey, hey, hey!

01:19:42.959 --> 01:19:43.333
Hey, come on!

01:19:43.417 --> 01:19:49.166
Stop right th-

01:19:51.083 --> 01:19:55.959
I thought we bonded.

01:19:58.208 --> 01:20:00.792
(somber music)

01:20:29.458 --> 01:20:31.333
- Thank you.

01:20:33.291 --> 01:20:34.041
- For what?

01:20:38.875 --> 01:20:42.875
- For... inspiring me to...

01:20:44.125 --> 01:20:44.959
get outta my chair.

01:20:48.667 --> 01:20:50.709
(sighs)

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.500
(somber music)

01:21:06.959 --> 01:21:07.542
Did you solve the mystery?

01:21:07.625 --> 01:21:10.959
(chuckles softly)

01:21:11.041 --> 01:21:11.875
- Yeah.

01:21:13.041 --> 01:21:13.166
Yeah, I did.

01:21:15.208 --> 01:21:17.041
(birds chirping)

01:21:24.083 --> 01:21:24.959
(video game music)

01:21:25.041 --> 01:21:27.125
(gunfire in game)

01:21:27.208 --> 01:21:30.041
- $10,000 has been
deposited, and we are

01:21:30.125 --> 01:21:32.959
officially a C corp in
the state of California,

01:21:33.041 --> 01:21:34.875
and what are these?

01:21:35.542 --> 01:21:37.166
- Night vision.

01:21:38.667 --> 01:21:42.166
- Snake, you can't just spend
the money however you want.

01:21:42.250 --> 01:21:43.583
We've already made
expense reports,

01:21:43.667 --> 01:21:44.542
and this is not on it.

01:21:44.625 --> 01:21:46.834
(knocking on door)

01:21:46.917 --> 01:21:49.917
(mysterious music)

01:22:00.250 --> 01:22:02.166
(birds chirping)

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.917
(digital humming)

01:22:49.083 --> 01:22:49.709
(device beeping)

01:22:49.792 --> 01:22:53.667
(suspenseful music)

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.667
(somber music)
