13:17.964 --> 13:21.300
I don't "use air quotes correctly,"
all right?

13:21.384 --> 13:24.971
But I am against double standards
across the board.

13:25.888 --> 13:26.931
Why is it...

13:27.640 --> 13:29.600
that when a woman
wears revealing clothing,

13:29.684 --> 13:31.060
she's labeled a slut,

13:31.144 --> 13:33.563
yet if I were to wear
her skin as a jacket,

13:33.646 --> 13:35.023
I'm a murderer?

13:35.106 --> 13:36.816
-What?
-[audience laughing]

13:38.276 --> 13:40.278
If I fuck a kid,
I'm a pedophile,

13:40.361 --> 13:43.406
but if a kid fucks me,
I'm the pedophile again?

13:43.489 --> 13:46.242

it's one thing to make that,

I'm a big fan of hip-hop.

15:34.642 --> 15:37.311
'Cause I like words.
I like poetry.

15:37.395 --> 15:39.897
And hip-hop feels like a way
to condense a lot of those things

15:39.981 --> 15:41.023
into a short amount of time.

15:41.107 --> 15:43.568
There are artists
that still do that. Uh...

15:43.651 --> 15:45.945

15:58.082 --> 16:02.336
has traded in words and poetry
for beat fetishism.

16:02.420 --> 16:07.383
It's where you make a sick beat
and then you rap anything over it.

16:07.467 --> 16:08.759
And people lose their minds.

16:08.843 --> 16:11.095

20:17.174 --> 20:18.759
gets a bad rep.

20:18.843 --> 20:21.011

when Bruce Springsteen

20:21.095 --> 20:23.389
sings about a fucking turnpike it is art,

20:23.472 --> 20:25.307
and then when someone sings
about a horse,

20:25.391 --> 20:27.643
it's dumb inherently?
I don't think... [scoffs]

20:27.727 --> 20:30.354
I think some of the greatest songwriters
of all time are country artists.

20:30.438 --> 20:32.273
Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson...
You know?

20:32.356 --> 20:34.608
And if you're writing honestly,
that is art.

20:34.692 --> 20:37.153
And I would never bash that.
Um, the problem is...

20:38.112 --> 20:42.742
with a lot of modern country music,
what is called stadium country music,

20:42.825 --> 20:45.745
the sort of Keith Urban brand
of country music,

20:45.828 --> 20:47.872
is that it is not honest.

20:47.955 --> 20:50.374
-It is the exact opposite of honest.
-[country music playing]

20:50.458 --> 20:52.668

actually telling their stories,

20:52.752 --> 20:54.754
you got a bunch
of millionaire metrosexuals

20:54.837 --> 20:56.630
who've never done
a hard day's work in their life,

20:56.714 --> 21:00.009
but they figured out the words
and the phrases they can use

21:00.092 --> 21:01.427
to pander to their audience,

21:01.510 --> 21:03.929
and they list the same words
and phrases off,

21:04.013 --> 21:06.223
sort of mad-lib style in every song,

I don't. You don't want that...

And a lot of...

37:15.984 --> 37:17.986
I feel a lot of artists,
pop artists especially,

37:18.069 --> 37:19.988
sort of infringe upon...

37:20.071 --> 37:23.283

in terms of their audience,

37:23.366 --> 37:26.661

becoming about performing.

I started performing very young,
as a teenager, you know, professionally.

46:14.939 --> 46:16.857
And as a comedian,
what you're supposed to do...

46:16.941 --> 46:18.776
You're supposed to talk
about what you know.

46:18.859 --> 46:20.778

46:20.861 --> 46:25.157

[chuckles] traffic or laundry

46:25.241 --> 46:26.742

about performing would be too meta.

It wouldn't be relatable to people
that aren't performers.

46:34.458 --> 46:37.962
But what I found is that
I don't think anyone isn't.

46:38.045 --> 46:40.506
Could we get the house lights up
for a second? And could you...

46:40.589 --> 46:42.967

Let the artifice fade away.

You know, I look out at...
I look out at you and, um...

46:55.229 --> 46:56.313
It's a very diverse crowd.

46:56.397 --> 46:58.566
I mean, more European
than I would've hoped, but...

46:58.649 --> 47:00.401
we'll get there.

47:02.528 --> 47:03.904
If I look at the young people...

47:03.988 --> 47:06.949
You know, and I feel like...
I was born in 1990

47:07.033 --> 47:11.203
and I was sort of raised in America
when it was a cult of self-expression.

47:11.287 --> 47:13.789
And I was just taught,
you know, express myself

47:13.873 --> 47:17.168
and have things to say
and everyone will care about them.

47:17.251 --> 47:18.502
And I think everyone was taught that

47:18.586 --> 47:22.673
and most of us found out
no one gives a shit what we think.

47:22.757 --> 47:25.092
So we flock to performers
by the thousands

47:25.176 --> 47:27.303
'cause we're the few
that have found an audience.

47:27.386 --> 47:29.680
And then I'm supposed to get up here
and say, "Follow your dreams,"

47:29.764 --> 47:32.516
as if this is a meritocracy?
It is not, okay?

47:32.600 --> 47:36.020
I had a privileged life
and I got lucky and I'm unhappy.

47:36.103 --> 47:37.813
[audience laughing]

47:38.522 --> 47:41.233
They say it's... it's like
the me generation. It's not.

47:41.317 --> 47:42.318
It's not...

47:42.401 --> 47:45.279
[stammers] The arrogance is taught
or it was cultivated.

47:45.362 --> 47:48.783
It's... it's self-conscious.
That's what it is. It's the...

47:48.866 --> 47:51.702
It's conscious of self...
[stammers] Social media...

47:51.786 --> 47:56.040
it's just the market's answer
to a generation that demanded to perform.

47:56.123 --> 47:59.043
So the market said,
"Here, perform everything

47:59.126 --> 48:01.378
to each other all the time
for no reason."

48:01.462 --> 48:03.130
It's prison, it's horrific.

48:03.214 --> 48:06.008
It is performer and audience
melded together.

48:06.092 --> 48:08.886
What do we want more than to lie
in our bed at the end of the day

48:08.969 --> 48:11.722
and just watch our life
as a satisfied audience member?

48:11.806 --> 48:15.559
I know very little about anything,
but what I do know is that

48:15.643 --> 48:18.479
if you can live your life
without an audience...

48:21.649 --> 48:23.984
you should do it.
And now you're thinking...

48:24.068 --> 48:28.114
"How the fuck are you gonna dig the show
out of this weird hole?"

48:28.197 --> 48:30.241
Oh, you want me to be funny
and make a point?

48:30.324 --> 48:32.159
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

48:34.120 --> 48:37.373
-Batman. So... how do we do it?
-[audience laughing]

48:38.415 --> 48:40.334
[cheering]

48:50.302 --> 48:51.637
We do it like this.

48:53.347 --> 48:55.349
I went to Kanye West's recent tour,
the Yeezus Tour.

48:55.432 --> 48:57.726
It was a big, dramatic, theatrical show.

48:57.810 --> 48:59.854
He did something very strange
at the end of his show

48:59.937 --> 49:02.940
where he ranted...
for, like, 20 minutes.

49:03.023 --> 49:04.400
It was kind of a rant,
kind of a song.

49:04.483 --> 49:05.860
He had auto-tune on his voice

49:05.943 --> 49:07.736
and there was an instrumental
in the background...

49:07.820 --> 49:10.281
-[instrumental music playing]
-...like this instrumental.

49:12.116 --> 49:13.659
He talked about his problems...

49:14.702 --> 49:15.828
race...

49:16.996 --> 49:18.581
power.

49:18.664 --> 49:21.167
His $90 T-shirts
weren't selling very well.

49:21.250 --> 49:23.961
That was most of it.
And I watched this.

49:25.379 --> 49:27.006
I thought maybe I could do this.

49:27.923 --> 49:29.300
I'll be honest, my problems

49:29.383 --> 49:32.761
are not as high-stakes as Kanye's,
but I have problems.

49:33.804 --> 49:36.223
And maybe a crowd in New York
would be nice enough to indulge me.

49:36.307 --> 49:38.559
So as we get to the end
of a night of theater...

49:38.642 --> 49:40.853
and comedy
and sweaters coming on and off,

49:40.936 --> 49:42.688
I got one question for you...

49:46.567 --> 49:48.235
