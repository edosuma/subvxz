06:54.515 --> 06:55.415
LOOK, WHEN ARE YOU GONNA START

06:55.415 --> 06:56.249
TRUSTING ME?

06:56.249 --> 06:57.184
>> I DO TRUST YOU, BUT THE

06:57.184 --> 06:58.519
NUMBERS DON'T LIE.

06:58.519 --> 06:59.620
>> NEITHER DOES THIS.

06:59.620 --> 07:00.588
>> WELL, THEN I GUESS WE'RE

07:00.588 --> 07:01.421
STUCK.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.856
>> OKAY, I'M GONNA SETTLE THIS

07:02.856 --> 07:04.324
FOR Y'ALL.

07:04.324 --> 07:06.426
I'M THE PRETTIEST, AND I ALWAYS

07:06.426 --> 07:07.561
WILL BE.

07:07.561 --> 07:09.863
[snaps fingers]

07:12.432 --> 07:13.433
>> I JUST SPOKE WITH MALCOLM'S

07:13.433 --> 07:14.902
LAWYER THIS AFTERNOON, AND

07:14.902 --> 07:16.103
YOU'RE RIGHT--IT IS ONLY A

07:16.103 --> 07:16.937
MATTER OF TIME.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.672
>> [scoffs] OH, PLEASE.

07:18.672 --> 07:19.940
THAT PHOTO DOESN'T PROVE

07:19.940 --> 07:21.208
ANYTHING.

07:21.208 --> 07:26.046
>> WHAT PHOTO?

07:26.046 --> 07:28.015
>> SON OF A BITCH.

07:28.015 --> 07:30.551
THEY HAVE OUR WEDDING PHOTO.

07:30.551 --> 07:32.252
>> WELL, THE QUESTION IS, WHY

07:32.252 --> 07:33.220
DON'T YOU HAVE IT?

07:33.220 --> 07:34.555
>> IT WAS ONE OF THOSE SOUVENIR

07:34.555 --> 07:37.157
PICTURES TAKEN BY THE HOTEL.

07:37.157 --> 07:38.391
THERE WAS SO MUCH DRINKING AND

07:38.391 --> 07:39.760
DANCING GOING ON, I'M SURPRISED

07:39.760 --> 07:41.929
WE DIDN'T LOSE IT.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.564
>> WELL, MARTINIQUE HAS NO

07:43.564 --> 07:44.397
RECORD OF A MARRIAGE

07:44.397 --> 07:45.833
CERTIFICATE.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.034
AT LEAST A PHOTO WOULD GIVE SOME

07:47.034 --> 07:47.901
WEIGHT TO THE CLAIM THAT YOU

07:47.901 --> 07:51.371
WERE ACTUALLY MARRIED.

07:51.371 --> 07:53.574
WERE YOU?

07:53.574 --> 07:54.908
>> YES.

07:54.908 --> 07:56.510
I ALREADY TOLD YOU.

07:56.510 --> 07:57.377
AND GOOD LUCK TRYING TO GET YOUR

07:57.377 --> 07:58.646
HANDS ON THE PICTURE NOW.

07:58.646 --> 07:59.713
THE HOTEL DIDN'T KEEP A COPY,

07:59.713 --> 08:00.781
AND MALCOLM SURE ISN'T GONNA

08:00.781 --> 08:03.416
HAND IT OVER.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.454
AT LEAST WE HAVE THIS RECORDING.

08:07.454 --> 08:09.890
>> WE CAN'T USE IT IN COURT.

08:09.890 --> 08:10.724
IT'S INADMISSIBLE.

08:10.724 --> 08:11.559
I OBTAINED IT WITHOUT HER

08:11.559 --> 08:12.593
CONSENT.

08:12.593 --> 08:13.794
MAYBE WE CAN COMPEL KEISHA TO

08:13.794 --> 08:14.628
TESTIFY.

08:14.628 --> 08:16.163
>> AGAINST MALCOLM?

08:16.163 --> 08:17.264
HELL DOESN'T GET THAT COLD.

08:17.264 --> 08:18.431
>> WELL, YOUR CASE IS GETTING

08:18.431 --> 08:19.299
COLD.

08:19.299 --> 08:20.133
YOU'VE GOT NO MARRIAGE

08:20.133 --> 08:21.969
CERTIFICATE, NO REVISED WILL,

08:21.969 --> 08:22.803
NOTHING.

08:22.803 --> 08:23.771
YOU'RE STARTING TO LOOK LIKE A

08:23.771 --> 08:24.938
JOKE, WHICH MEANS I'M STARTING

08:24.938 --> 08:26.406
TO LOOK LIKE A JOKE, WHICH IS

08:26.406 --> 08:28.508
A PROBLEM.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.944
>> LOOK...

08:30.944 --> 08:32.580
I MAY NOT HAVE PROOF THAT I WAS

08:32.580 --> 08:34.414
MARRIED TO MAC, BUT I HAVE

08:34.414 --> 08:35.415
SOMETHING ELSE THAT YOU WANT

08:35.415 --> 08:36.650
EVEN MORE.

08:36.650 --> 08:37.818
I WORKED FOR FRANKS JEWELS FOR

08:37.818 --> 08:39.086
THREE YEARS.

08:39.086 --> 08:40.654
I HAVE EVIDENCE THAT THE COMPANY

08:40.654 --> 08:42.623
IS BEING USED TO LAUNDER MONEY.

08:42.623 --> 08:43.456
>> IF THAT'S TRUE...

08:43.456 --> 08:44.658
>> IT COULD DESTROY THE COMPANY

08:44.658 --> 08:46.093
AND TARNISH MAC'S REPUTATION,

08:46.093 --> 08:47.294
I KNOW.

08:47.294 --> 08:48.962
THAT'S WHY I KEPT IT TO MYSELF.

08:48.962 --> 08:50.731
>> LOOK, YOU'RE OUT OF OPTIONS,

08:50.731 --> 08:52.766
AND I'M OUT OF PATIENCE.

08:52.766 --> 08:53.967
IF YOU'VE GOT HARD EVIDENCE

08:53.967 --> 08:55.435
AGAINST THE FRANKS FAMILY, IT'S

08:55.435 --> 08:58.639
TIME WE USE IT.

09:03.577 --> 09:04.645
>> OH!

09:04.645 --> 09:06.747
DECISIONS.

09:06.747 --> 09:07.748
>> CAN'T GO WRONG WITH CLASSIC

09:07.748 --> 09:08.582
BLACK, BABE.

09:08.582 --> 09:09.750
>> [sighs]

09:09.750 --> 09:11.118
GIRL, YOU ARE MY CHANEL NUMBER

09:11.118 --> 09:13.520
FIVE, SIX, AND SEVEN.

09:13.520 --> 09:14.688
IF TERRENCE CAN'T SEE THAT, HE'S

09:14.688 --> 09:16.189
AN IDIOT.

09:16.189 --> 09:17.024
>> [sighs]

09:17.024 --> 09:18.125
YEAH, WELL, WHY DON'T YOU

09:18.125 --> 09:19.192
TELL HIM?

09:19.192 --> 09:20.628
HONESTLY, IF WE MAKE IT TO

09:20.628 --> 09:21.895
GLAM WALK WITHOUT KILLING EACH

09:21.895 --> 09:23.897
OTHER, IT'LL BE A MIRACLE.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.766
I'VE NEVER MET SOMEONE WHO IS SO

09:25.766 --> 09:27.367
STUBBORN AND--AND BOORISH

09:27.367 --> 09:28.736
AND--AND--

09:28.736 --> 09:30.303
>> AND DELICIOUS?

09:30.303 --> 09:32.740
[cell phone vibrates]

09:32.740 --> 09:36.043
HELLO?

09:36.043 --> 09:39.046
OH--IS HE HURT?

09:39.046 --> 09:40.013
YEAH, OF COURSE, I'LL BE RIGHT

09:40.013 --> 09:40.848
THERE.

09:40.848 --> 09:41.682
>> WHAT HAPPENED?

09:41.682 --> 09:42.515
IS IT NATE?

09:42.515 --> 09:43.350
>> I JUST GOT CALLED TO THE

09:43.350 --> 09:44.184
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE.

09:44.184 --> 09:45.085
MY NEPHEW COREY GOT INTO A

09:45.085 --> 09:45.919
FIGHT AT SCHOOL.

09:45.919 --> 09:46.887
THEY CAN'T REACH PRESLEY, AND

09:46.887 --> 09:48.088
I'M NEXT ON THE CONTACT LIST,

09:48.088 --> 09:48.922
SO...

09:48.922 --> 09:49.957
SO I'M SORRY, I GOT TO GO.

09:49.957 --> 09:51.124
>> OF COURSE, OF COURSE.

09:51.124 --> 09:52.960
GO TAKE CARE OF YOUR FAMILY.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.195
BUT KEEP ME POSTED!

09:55.195 --> 09:58.031
>> LET'S DO THAT ONE WITH THE--

09:58.031 --> 10:00.467
BYE, BABE--WITH THE TWO BOOTS.

10:00.467 --> 10:01.301
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:01.301 --> 10:02.903
>> HEY, BOO-BOO, DADDY'S HOME.

10:02.903 --> 10:03.737
>> OH, MY GOD.

10:03.737 --> 10:04.571
HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE?

10:04.571 --> 10:05.605
>> OH, I PROMISED A P.A. I'D GET

10:05.605 --> 10:06.640
HIM BACKSTAGE AT KANYE.

10:06.640 --> 10:07.708
AND WHILE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

10:07.708 --> 10:08.876
BACKSTAGES, I SEE YOU IN THEM

10:08.876 --> 10:09.710
PANTS.

10:09.710 --> 10:10.878
>> DAVID, I'M GONNA SAY THIS ONE

10:10.878 --> 10:12.045
TIME--THIS PHOTO SHOOT WAS

10:12.045 --> 10:12.880
MY IDEA.

10:12.880 --> 10:13.714
STAY OUT OF IT.

10:13.714 --> 10:14.581
>> YOU KNOW, DATING AN ASSISTANT

10:14.581 --> 10:15.615
HAS MADE YOU REALLY BOSSY.

10:15.615 --> 10:16.750
>> BEN IS AN EXECUTIVE

10:16.750 --> 10:17.951
ASSISTANT AND A SMALL-BUSINESS

10:17.951 --> 10:20.020
OWNER, WHO, BY THE WAY, MADE

10:20.020 --> 10:21.354
MORE MONEY THAN YOU LAST YEAR.

10:21.354 --> 10:22.422
>> OH, DO YOU FEEL THE NEED TO

10:22.422 --> 10:23.556
THROW HIS SALARY IN MY FACE

10:23.556 --> 10:24.858
BECAUSE HE'S LACKING IN OTHER

10:24.858 --> 10:26.526
DEPARTMENTS...

10:26.526 --> 10:27.627
THAT I SPECIALIZE IN?

10:27.627 --> 10:28.461
>> YOU'RE AN ASS.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.562
>> DEFINITELY, BUT I KNOW WHAT'S

10:29.562 --> 10:30.397
BOTHERING YOU.

10:30.397 --> 10:32.032
>> NOTHING IS BOTHERING ME.

10:32.032 --> 10:33.233
>> OH, I SAW YOUR FACE WHEN

10:33.233 --> 10:34.567
I COMPLIMENTED RAQUEL.

10:34.567 --> 10:35.402
YOU'RE JEALOUS.

10:35.402 --> 10:36.704
>> JEALOUS OF WHAT?

10:36.704 --> 10:37.805
NEITHER ONE OF US ARE INTERESTED

10:37.805 --> 10:39.773
IN YOU, I PROMISE.

10:39.773 --> 10:40.874
NOW, I NEED TO DEAL WITH THIS.

10:40.874 --> 10:41.775
YOU THINK YOU CAN STAY OUT OF MY

10:41.775 --> 10:43.043
BUSINESS?

10:43.043 --> 10:43.877
>> [sighs]

10:43.877 --> 10:44.945
NOT WHEN YOU WAVE IT AROUND LIKE

10:44.945 --> 10:46.814
THAT.

10:46.814 --> 10:48.849
HEY, RAQUEL.

10:48.849 --> 10:50.884
I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT YOU.

10:50.884 --> 10:52.185
HEY, THIS PHOTO SHOOT IS GOING

10:52.185 --> 10:53.220
TO BE ELECTRIC.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.054
>> RIGHT?

10:54.054 --> 10:55.522
DON'T TOUCH THE MODELS.

10:55.522 --> 10:57.090
YOU MIGHT GET SHOCKED.

10:57.090 --> 10:58.425
>> YOU KNOW, I AM REALLY, REALLY

10:58.425 --> 10:59.626
IMPRESSED BY EVERYTHING YOU

10:59.626 --> 11:00.694
GOT GOING ON HERE.

11:00.694 --> 11:02.629
I MEAN, FROM INDULGENCE TO

11:02.629 --> 11:03.697
CUT...

11:03.697 --> 11:04.832
>> [chuckles]

11:04.832 --> 11:05.766
HERE WE GO.

11:05.766 --> 11:06.867
APRIL WARNED ME ABOUT YOU.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.035
>> HMM, THEN YOU KNOW HOW GOOD

11:08.035 --> 11:09.636
I AM.

11:09.636 --> 11:10.771
LOOK, I HAVE AN IDEA THAT

11:10.771 --> 11:11.638
I THINK YOU'LL LOVE.

11:11.638 --> 11:13.673
I WANT TO OFFER MY STAR CLIENT

11:13.673 --> 11:14.708
TO PERFORM AT YOUR JEWELRY

11:14.708 --> 11:15.542
LAUNCH.

11:15.542 --> 11:16.676
>> YOUR STAR CLIENT?

11:16.676 --> 11:17.510
>> YEP, YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD

11:17.510 --> 11:18.345
OF HER--

11:18.345 --> 11:19.512
GRAMMY-WINNING, PLATINUM-SELLING

11:19.512 --> 11:20.613
ARTIST CHEYENNE.

11:20.613 --> 11:21.414
>> CHEYENNE?

11:21.414 --> 11:22.249
>> MM-HMM.

11:22.249 --> 11:23.183
>> OH, MY GOD, THAT'S A GREAT

11:23.183 --> 11:24.017
IDEA.

11:24.017 --> 11:24.852
I LOVE HER.

11:24.852 --> 11:25.819
I JUST GOT TO CLEAR IT WITH

11:25.819 --> 11:26.653
MY PARTNER.

11:26.653 --> 11:27.487
>> OH, WELL, I COMPLETELY

11:27.487 --> 11:28.321
UNDERSTAND.

11:28.321 --> 11:29.790
BUT--EH, NEVER MIND.

11:29.790 --> 11:30.623
>> WHAT?

11:30.623 --> 11:31.825
>> WELL, I ASSUMED YOU WERE THE

11:31.825 --> 11:33.026
BRAINS BEHIND THE BRAND.

11:33.026 --> 11:33.961
BUT IF YOU WANT ME TO GO THROUGH

11:33.961 --> 11:35.028
YOUR PARTNER, I CAN DEFINITELY--

11:35.028 --> 11:36.429
>> LOOK, DAVID, I'M NOT GONNA

11:36.429 --> 11:37.330
PLAY THIS GAME WITH YOU.

11:37.330 --> 11:38.265
JUST TELL ME WHAT YOU'VE GOT

11:38.265 --> 11:39.132
PLANNED, AND IF IT'S GOOD

11:39.132 --> 11:40.200
ENOUGH, I'M SURE WE'LL BOTH GET

11:40.200 --> 11:41.034
ON BOARD.

11:41.034 --> 11:41.869
>> OKAY.

11:41.869 --> 11:42.803
WELL, HOW ABOUT LUNCH TOMORROW?

11:42.803 --> 11:45.205
>> SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.

11:48.441 --> 11:49.977
HEY, YOU WEREN'T PLAYING.

11:49.977 --> 11:50.978
DAVID IS A HUSTLER.

11:50.978 --> 11:52.179
>> SATAN'S MINION.

11:52.179 --> 11:53.646
>> EH, MAYBE THAT'S JUST HIS

11:53.646 --> 11:54.481
WORK M.O.

11:54.481 --> 11:55.883
EITHER WAY, HE'S WORTH AT LEAST

11:55.883 --> 11:57.150
ONE LUNCH.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.118
>> WHAT?

11:58.118 --> 11:59.286
YOU'RE GOING TO LUNCH WITH HIM?

11:59.286 --> 12:00.653
>> HE WANTS TO PITCH CHEYENNE

12:00.653 --> 12:01.488
FOR THE BIG LAUNCH.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.156
HE DIDN'T TELL YOU?

12:03.156 --> 12:04.057
>> AND YOU THINK THAT'S ALL

12:04.057 --> 12:04.892
HE WANTS?

12:04.892 --> 12:06.659
>> WHAT ELSE WOULD HE WANT?

12:06.659 --> 12:07.694
OH, NO, HONEY...

12:07.694 --> 12:09.362
[scoffs] NOT HAPPENING.

12:09.362 --> 12:11.164
LOOK, YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THAT

12:11.164 --> 12:12.232
THIS COULD BE GREAT EXPOSURE FOR

12:12.232 --> 12:13.200
CUT, BUT IF YOU DON'T WANT ME

12:13.200 --> 12:14.034
TO GO--

12:14.034 --> 12:14.868
>> NO.

12:14.868 --> 12:15.702
NO, NO, NO.

12:15.702 --> 12:16.536
GO.

12:16.536 --> 12:17.370
YEAH.

12:17.370 --> 12:18.238
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO

12:18.238 --> 12:19.072
GET HURT.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.007
>> I CAN HANDLE DAVID, APRIL.

12:20.007 --> 12:24.177
>> [chuckles]

12:29.749 --> 12:31.084
>> IT'S A PLAYGROUND FIGHT.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.252
THESE THINGS HAPPEN.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.520
>> HONEY, LET HER TALK SO WE CAN

12:33.520 --> 12:34.687
GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.

12:34.687 --> 12:36.156
>> ALL I'M SAYING IS, OUR SON

12:36.156 --> 12:36.990
WAS PROBABLY JUST DEFENDING

12:36.990 --> 12:37.825
HIMSELF.

12:37.825 --> 12:38.658
>> RIGHT.

12:38.658 --> 12:39.692
>> "OUR SON"?

12:39.692 --> 12:40.894
I KNOW I'VE BEEN OUT OF THE

12:40.894 --> 12:42.229
PICTURE FOR A MINUTE, BUT Y'ALL

12:42.229 --> 12:43.063
AIN'T MARRIED.

12:43.063 --> 12:44.164
SO, AT BEST, YOU'RE STILL A

12:44.164 --> 12:46.099
FAMILY FRIEND.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.868
>> OKAY, OMAR, PLEASE.

12:47.868 --> 12:48.701
>> PRESLEY, WHAT IS HE DOING

12:48.701 --> 12:49.536
HERE?

12:49.536 --> 12:50.370
>> I DON'T KNOW.

20:01.434 --> 20:02.835
IT WAS A BUSINESS LUNCH.

20:02.835 --> 20:03.836

20:08.741 --> 20:09.676
AND ACTUALLY, DAVID HAD A

20:09.676 --> 20:13.045
FANTASTIC IDEA FOR CUT.

>> YOU TOOK A MEETING FOR CUT?

20:16.949 --> 20:18.618
GIRL, YOU ARE NOT GONNA BELIEVE

20:18.618 --> 20:20.119
HOW MY LUNCH ENDED WITH BEN.

20:20.119 --> 20:21.220

>> YEAH, I KNOW, BUT THIS IS

20:25.458 --> 20:26.793

20:29.596 --> 20:30.863
CHEYENNE TO PERFORM AT THE CUT

>> YEAH, BUT NO, SEE, THAT'S

20:32.665 --> 20:33.866
WHAT I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU

20:33.866 --> 20:34.701
ABOUT.

20:34.701 --> 20:35.668
AFTER BEN WAS ARRESTED, I MADE A

20:35.668 --> 20:36.503
FEW CALLS AND--

20:36.503 --> 20:37.737
>> WHOA, BEN WAS ARRESTED?

20:37.737 --> 20:38.705
>> YEAH, LONG STORY.

20:38.705 --> 20:39.539

20:39.539 --> 20:40.940
THE POINT IS, I THINK WE CAN GET

20:40.940 --> 20:41.774

20:50.116 --> 20:51.784
>> GOOD, BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE

20:51.784 --> 20:52.619
CHEYENNE.

20:52.619 --> 20:53.453
>> GREAT.

21:27.854 --> 21:28.821

25:17.717 --> 25:18.918
I SHOULD HAVE NEVER CHOSE

25:18.918 --> 25:23.455

I'M SO SORRY.

25:34.400 --> 25:37.169
>> ALL RIGHT.

25:37.169 --> 25:38.204
I MISSED YOU TOO.

25:38.204 --> 25:40.840

25:51.350 --> 25:53.352
>> I COULDN'T STOP THE MOTION.

25:53.352 --> 25:55.021
>> SON OF A BITCH.

25:55.021 --> 25:56.022
GRIFFIN, I DON'T CARE WHAT THIS

25:56.022 --> 25:56.856
SAYS.

25:56.856 --> 25:57.757
SEAN CLARK IS NOT GETTING A HOLD

25:57.757 --> 25:58.958

26:18.410 --> 26:19.812
NOW, I KNOW I'M IRRESISTIBLE,

26:19.812 --> 26:20.813
BUT I'M A LITTLE TOO BUSY FOR

26:20.813 --> 26:21.648
A THREESOME.

26:21.648 --> 26:22.815
WAIT, WHO AM I KIDDING?

26:22.815 --> 26:23.650
NO I'M NOT!

26:23.650 --> 26:24.483
[laughs]

26:24.483 --> 26:26.185
>> COOL YOUR JETS, BEETLEJUICE.

26:26.185 --> 26:27.353
WE'RE HERE ON BUSINESS.

26:27.353 --> 26:28.621
>> I PREFER TO GIVE BAD NEWS

26:28.621 --> 26:29.822
IN PERSON.

26:29.822 --> 26:31.023
YOUR FEATURE-PERFORMER IDEA

26:31.023 --> 26:32.825
FOR CUT--IT WAS SMART.

26:32.825 --> 26:33.660
>> I KNOW.

26:33.660 --> 26:34.526
THAT'S WHY I PITCHED IT.

26:34.526 --> 26:35.427
>> BUT CHEYENNE IS THE FACE OF

26:35.427 --> 26:36.629
MANY BRANDS--TOO MANY.

26:36.629 --> 26:38.631
IN FACT, SHE'S A BIT OF A WHORE

26:38.631 --> 26:39.932
WHEN IT COMES TO PROMOTION.

26:39.932 --> 26:41.033
>> THUS, THE TWO OF YOU MAKE A

26:41.033 --> 26:42.001
PERFECT MATCH.

26:42.001 --> 26:43.469
BUT WE WANT A FRESHER,

26:43.469 --> 26:45.304
UNTARNISHED IMAGE FOR CUT, AND

26:45.304 --> 26:46.438
SINCE RAQUEL AND I HAVE A

26:46.438 --> 26:47.807
LONG-STANDING FRIENDSHIP...

26:47.807 --> 26:49.341
>> I'VE DECIDED TO GO WITH KEKE.

26:49.341 --> 26:50.442
>> AKA, THE CLIENT WHO SIGNED

26:50.442 --> 26:51.911
WITH ME, NOT YOU.

26:51.911 --> 26:53.112
>> REALLY, RAQUEL?

26:53.112 --> 26:54.346
LOOK, I'VE BEEN DOING THIS

26:54.346 --> 26:55.181
LONGER.

26:55.181 --> 26:56.816
I CAN MAKE SURE IT'S DONE RIGHT.

26:56.816 --> 26:58.084
DON'T LET FRIENDSHIP CLOUD YOUR

26:58.084 --> 26:58.918
JUDGMENT.

26:58.918 --> 27:00.252
>> OH, DON'T WORRY.

27:00.252 --> 27:01.387
I WOULDN'T...

27:01.387 --> 27:02.655
THE SAME WAY I WOULDN'T ALLOW

27:02.655 --> 27:04.156
MYSELF TO BE TREATED LIKE A PAWN

27:04.156 --> 27:05.692
IN SOME SILLY LITTLE COMPETITION

27:05.692 --> 27:07.193
BETWEEN CO-WORKERS.

27:07.193 --> 27:08.394
NOTHING PERSONAL.

27:08.394 --> 27:09.428
>> JUST BUSINESS.

27:09.428 --> 27:10.529
>> EXACTLY.

27:10.529 --> 27:13.099
GOOD NIGHT.

27:13.099 --> 27:13.933
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?

27:13.933 --> 27:15.735
THIS WAS LOW, EVEN FOR YOU.

27:15.735 --> 27:16.568
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?

27:16.568 --> 27:17.469
YOU'RE JUST PISSED BECAUSE

27:17.469 --> 27:18.304
I BEAT YOU AT YOUR OWN GAME,

27:18.304 --> 27:19.138
DAVID.

27:19.138 --> 27:20.039
>> NO, I GET A ALLERGIC REACTION

27:20.039 --> 27:20.873
WHEN YOU COME AROUND!

27:20.873 --> 27:21.841
>> JUST GET OVER IT!

27:35.922 --> 27:37.223
AFTER ALL OF THAT.

27:37.223 --> 27:39.491

27:39.491 --> 27:40.592
YOU'RE JEALOUS.

27:40.592 --> 27:41.994
>> OH, YOU WISH.

27:41.994 --> 27:43.529
EVER SINCE I REJECTED YOU, ALL

27:46.999 --> 27:48.167
I GET UNDER YOUR SKIN.

27:48.167 --> 27:49.035
>> GO TO HELL.

27:49.035 --> 27:50.336
>> I AM IN HELL.

27:50.336 --> 27:51.237
EVERY TIME I'M AROUND YOU,

27:51.237 --> 27:52.338
I FEEL LIKE I'M BEING THROWN

27:52.338 --> 27:54.073
INTO A FLAMING PIT OF RAINBOWS

27:54.073 --> 27:54.907
AND LOLLIPOPS.

CELEBRATION.

28:38.751 --> 28:40.419
>> OH, NOT YET.

28:40.419 --> 28:41.253
LOOK, THE WHOLE POINT WAS TO

28:41.253 --> 28:42.488
FIND HARD EVIDENCE AGAINST

28:42.488 --> 28:43.823
MALCOLM TO GIVE TO THE D.A.

28:43.823 --> 28:44.757
WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK AHEAD

HIS FREEDOM IS ON THE LINE.

>> WELL, UH...

29:13.419 --> 29:17.623
I WON'T BE A PARTY TO BLACKMAIL.

29:17.623 --> 29:18.891

30:21.287 --> 30:22.621
I DO TRUST YOUR OPINION, AND

BUT YOU'RE SUPER PASSIONATE WHEN

30:38.770 --> 30:40.506
YOU CARE ABOUT SOMETHING.

ALL RIGHT, COME ON, WE STILL

32:13.699 --> 32:14.933
WE DON'T HAVE IT.

32:14.933 --> 32:16.202
>> WE DON'T HAVE WHAT?

32:16.202 --> 32:17.203
>> I'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH THE

32:17.203 --> 32:18.304
PROTOTYPES IN MY HEAD, AND I'M

32:18.304 --> 32:19.405
NOT FEELING THE BRACELET.

32:19.405 --> 32:20.472
>> WHAT?

32:20.472 --> 32:21.307
>> [sighs]

32:21.307 --> 32:22.141
>> I THOUGHT THIS WAS IT.

32:22.141 --> 32:23.075
>> I MEAN, IT'S COOL, BUT IT

32:23.075 --> 32:24.543
DOESN'T POP--NOT FOR A FASHION

32:31.083 --> 32:32.251
>> A SHOWSTOPPER.

32:32.251 --> 32:33.785
AND WE DON'T HAVE IT.

32:33.785 --> 32:35.621
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.

32:35.621 --> 32:37.723
OKAY, WELL, WE GOT A FEW MORE

32:37.723 --> 32:38.757
HOURS BEFORE THE SUN COMES UP.

32:38.757 --> 32:39.591
DO YOU THINK WE CAN SOLVE IT

32:39.591 --> 32:40.426
BY THEN?

32:40.426 --> 32:41.360
>> I DO MY BEST WORK BEFORE

32:41.360 --> 32:42.361
SUNRISE.

32:42.361 --> 32:43.362
[chuckles]

32:43.362 --> 32:45.531
>> REALLY, I CAN'T.

32:45.531 --> 32:48.934
>> I'M JUST SAYING.

33:08.620 --> 33:09.455
>> OKAY.

33:09.455 --> 33:10.289

33:10.289 --> 33:11.257
>> I KNOW IT'S STRESSFUL

33:11.257 --> 33:13.025
SLEEPING IN A NEW HOUSE, BUT

33:13.025 --> 33:15.994
THIS IS BEYOND.

33:23.202 --> 33:24.103
BUT I ALSO DON'T WANT YOU

33:24.103 --> 33:25.171
FEELING LIKE YOU'RE STUCK HERE

33:25.171 --> 33:26.038

33:28.874 --> 33:30.876
I DON'T FEEL STUCK.

33:30.876 --> 33:32.978
THERE'S NO PLACE...

33:32.978 --> 33:35.581
NO PLACE I'D RATHER BE.

33:35.581 --> 33:37.316
>> GOOD...

33:37.316 --> 33:38.350
'CAUSE I FEEL LIKE THERE'S A

33:38.350 --> 33:41.187
STORM COMING...

33:41.187 --> 33:42.421
AND I DON'T WANT TO RIDE THIS

33:42.421 --> 33:45.424
ONE OUT ALONE.

34:03.842 --> 34:05.111
>> NONE OF THIS WORKS.

34:05.111 --> 34:06.245
WE HAVE SIX HOURS TO GO, AND WE

34:06.245 --> 34:07.079
HAVE NOTHING.

34:07.079 --> 34:08.714
>> DON'T GIVE UP, OKAY?

>> CAN I BORROW YOUR PHONE?

34:17.022 --> 34:18.857
I NEED TO CALL APRIL.

34:18.857 --> 34:21.993
HOPEFULLY SHE'S FREE BY NOW.

34:24.763 --> 34:26.832
WHAT'S THIS?

34:26.832 --> 34:27.666
>> NOTHING.

34:27.666 --> 34:28.500
SOME STUFF I DID WHEN I WAS

34:28.500 --> 34:29.335
THROWING AROUND THE JEWELRY

34:51.257 --> 34:53.925
SHOULDERS AND THEN DRAPED THE

NOTCH.

34:58.430 --> 34:59.265

38:24.135 --> 38:24.970
I KNEW THIS WAS MORE THAN A

38:24.970 --> 38:25.971
COMPETITION THING.

38:25.971 --> 38:27.506
ALL THIS TIME, YOU WERE INTO

38:27.506 --> 38:29.475
DAVID, AND DAVID WAS DEEP
