02:06.920 --> 02:08.895
Now, before we bring

02:06.920 --> 02:08.895
our acts out, I gotta ask,

02:09.620 --> 02:10.864
what makes a show-stopping

02:09.620 --> 02:10.864
performance?

02:10.963 --> 02:12.650
Meghan?

02:12.164 --> 02:13.365
- A show-stopping

02:12.164 --> 02:13.365
performance--

02:13.466 --> 02:15.100
every time I see one,

02:13.466 --> 02:15.100
I always get goosebumps

02:15.200 --> 02:16.735
all over my body, chills.

02:16.836 --> 02:18.437
It's that moment

02:16.836 --> 02:18.437
when you feel like a kid again,

02:18.538 --> 02:19.538
and you're like--

02:19.639 --> 02:22.108
you'll see me over here like--

02:19.639 --> 02:22.108
ahh!

02:22.207 --> 02:25.311
And it's one of the reasons

02:22.207 --> 02:25.311
why I wanted to be a performer.

02:25.412 --> 02:27.579
- Absolutely.

02:25.412 --> 02:27.579
Y'all, spoiler alert:

02:27.681 --> 02:29.348
I think we about

02:27.681 --> 02:29.348

Y'all ready?

02:30.984 --> 02:33.687
Ready?

02:30.984 --> 02:33.687
All right.

02:33.787 --> 02:37.623

02:37.723 --> 02:40.793

02:57.711 --> 03:00.546
singing that made me feel like

I can do something

03:00.646 --> 03:04.150

<i>I kind of put everything</i>

03:42.989 --> 03:45.557
<i>on hold,</i>

03:45.658 --> 03:48.762

03:45.658 --> 03:48.762
a stay-at-home mom for a while.

"Oh, she must have been

And overall performance.

06:44.699 --> 06:46.238
I had a great time.

06:46.338 --> 06:49.843
we can help--maybe presence,

you know, and excitement.

07:07.927 --> 07:11.930

07:12.319 --> 07:13.365
- Well, I love Cher.

07:13.466 --> 07:15.235
I mean, I sang in front of Cher

07:13.466 --> 07:15.235
a couple years ago,

07:15.334 --> 07:16.502
<i>and I was so nervous.</i>

07:16.603 --> 07:17.836
<i>And speaking of nerves,</i>

07:17.937 --> 07:19.338
the thing that I'm really

07:17.937 --> 07:19.338
impressed with is you seem

07:19.439 --> 07:21.408
so comfortable on stage,

07:19.439 --> 07:21.408
which I really love.

07:21.507 --> 07:22.742
Well, you're fooling me.

07:21.507 --> 07:22.742
It's great.

07:22.841 --> 07:23.877
- It's the wig.

07:22.841 --> 07:23.877
- Yeah.

07:24.439 --> 07:25.577
- Makes me comfortable.

07:24.439 --> 07:25.577
It's the outfit.

07:25.678 --> 07:27.213
- But you're really--

07:25.678 --> 07:27.213
I mean, that is what

07:27.312 --> 07:29.783
Cher is so good at,

07:27.312 --> 07:29.783
is she's so at ease.

07:29.882 --> 07:32.117
She's so confident

07:29.882 --> 07:32.117
and comfortable in her skin,

07:32.218 --> 07:33.653
and that--to me,

07:32.218 --> 07:33.653
that's a show stopper.

07:33.752 --> 07:35.879
- Thank you.

07:35.187 --> 07:38.124
- Now, since you haven't been

07:35.187 --> 07:38.124
doing this for a while,

07:38.223 --> 07:39.425
I'm gonna tell you--

07:38.223 --> 07:39.425
you know, the gays

07:39.526 --> 07:41.939
are really specific

07:39.526 --> 07:41.939
about what they want their

07:41.194 --> 07:43.228
Cher impersonators

07:41.194 --> 07:43.228
to be able to do.

07:43.329 --> 07:45.497
- I know. I'm scared.

07:43.329 --> 07:45.497
- It's really important.

07:45.598 --> 07:47.266
And Cher--you know,

07:45.598 --> 07:47.266
there's the isms...

07:47.367 --> 07:48.802
- Show them.

07:47.367 --> 07:48.802
- That impersonators do.

07:48.901 --> 07:49.802
But, like,

07:48.901 --> 07:49.802
you have to go, like, "Oh."

07:49.903 --> 07:50.803
- Come on. Yeah.

07:50.903 --> 07:52.720
- Like, you have

07:50.903 --> 07:52.720
to do the thing.

07:52.172 --> 07:53.973
"Snap out of it!"

07:52.172 --> 07:53.973
you know, you gotta, like--

07:54.740 --> 07:55.608
there's all these--

07:54.740 --> 07:55.608
I mean, they're kind of--

07:55.709 --> 07:57.476
like, they're tried and true,

07:55.709 --> 07:57.476
you know?

07:57.576 --> 07:58.511
- Right.

07:58.610 --> 07:59.678
- Do you know what else

07:58.610 --> 07:59.678
she does?

07:59.778 --> 08:01.146
She does this, like,

07:59.778 --> 08:01.146
love sign thing.

08:01.247 --> 08:02.514
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:01.247 --> 08:02.514
- It's like this, like...

08:02.615 --> 08:03.716
- Right.

08:02.615 --> 08:03.716
- "I love you. I love you."

08:03.817 --> 08:05.451

08:05.552 --> 08:07.553

08:13.293 --> 08:15.279
I've been so nervous.

08:15.610 --> 08:16.495
It's like, whew!

08:15.610 --> 08:16.495
You know, when you sing

08:16.596 --> 08:18.630
and you're nervous,

08:16.596 --> 08:18.630
it's like--yeah.

08:18.731 --> 08:22.634
Which is good when you do Cher,

08:18.731 --> 08:22.634
because she's got that vibrato.

08:22.735 --> 08:24.237
- You're rooting for her.

08:22.735 --> 08:24.237
We're rooting for her, right?

08:24.336 --> 08:26.939
- Yeah! -

That's right.

08:27.399 --> 08:29.641
All right.

08:27.399 --> 08:29.641
We got a lot of show to get to.

13:54.167 --> 13:57.336
So I want you to take

13:54.167 --> 13:57.336
some of your normal voice,

13:57.437 --> 13:58.804
singing voice, out,

13:58.904 --> 14:01.206
and put in, like, more Tina.

14:01.307 --> 14:05.450
So I would love to send you

14:01.307 --> 14:05.450
to an amazing vocal expert,

14:05.110 --> 14:07.312
who can, like,

14:05.110 --> 14:07.312
show you how to use that grit

14:07.413 --> 14:09.515
and just to it

14:07.413 --> 14:09.515
to the next level.

14:09.615 --> 14:11.350
[cheers and applause]

14:11.451 --> 14:14.287
- All right, so two amazing

14:11.451 --> 14:14.287
artists set it off.

14:14.386 --> 14:15.688
Now, when we come back,

14:15.788 --> 14:18.658
let's see how our show stoppers

14:15.788 --> 14:18.658
prepared for our battle,

14:18.758 --> 14:20.626
with some help

14:18.758 --> 14:20.626
from our class experts.

14:20.726 --> 14:25.264
[cheers and applause]

14:25.365 --> 14:27.767
- * If you love me now

14:27.866 --> 14:29.690
- One more time.

14:29.168 --> 14:30.970
You don't need to elongate

14:29.168 --> 14:30.970
anything like that.

14:31.710 --> 14:32.806
Now?

14:32.905 --> 14:34.908
Get in, get out.

14:35.750 --> 14:36.576
- Big stance. Go.

14:36.676 --> 14:37.876
- More attitude is

14:36.676 --> 14:37.876
what you're saying?

14:37.976 --> 14:39.946
- More attitude,

14:37.976 --> 14:39.946
and conviction.

14:44.984 --> 14:47.419
<i>[upbeat music]</i>

14:47.519 --> 14:50.557
- I'm on my way right now

14:47.519 --> 14:50.557
to meet with a movement expert

14:50.657 --> 14:52.524
to work on my Cher-ism moves.

14:52.625 --> 14:55.394
- I'm on my way

14:52.625 --> 14:55.394
to the vocal expert,

14:55.495 --> 14:58.398
so I can get this Tina grit.

14:58.498 --> 15:00.166
- I'm so excited to meet him.

15:00.265 --> 15:01.467
Hi.

15:00.265 --> 15:01.467
- My name is Ray.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.570
- Nice to meet you.

15:03.669 --> 15:04.803
I am a choreographer.

15:04.903 --> 15:07.506
I've worked with everyone

15:04.903 --> 15:07.506
from Elton John

15:07.606 --> 15:08.774
to Snoop Dogg,

15:08.875 --> 15:11.144
and I have also worked

15:08.875 --> 15:11.144
with Cher.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.145
Cher has been one of my

15:11.244 --> 15:13.145
favorite people to work with,

15:13.245 --> 15:16.282
so getting to work with you

15:13.245 --> 15:16.282
and work on the whole

15:16.383 --> 15:18.317
Cher thing,

15:16.383 --> 15:18.317
I'm so excited about.

15:18.418 --> 15:19.586
- Awesome.

15:19.686 --> 15:21.421
So I'm super excited

15:19.686 --> 15:21.421
to work with Ray today.

15:21.520 --> 15:22.721
I mean, he's worked with Cher.

15:22.822 --> 15:23.889
It doesn't get better

15:22.822 --> 15:23.889
than that.

15:24.570 --> 15:27.360
* If I could turn back time

15:27.460 --> 15:30.963
* If I could find a way

15:31.639 --> 15:32.631
- How long have you been Cher?

15:32.731 --> 15:34.134
- It's like my second gig.

15:34.234 --> 15:35.235
- What?

15:35.335 --> 15:37.169
- This is your second gig

15:35.335 --> 15:37.169
as Cher?

15:37.269 --> 15:38.303
- What?

15:38.404 --> 15:40.673
- I came here 31 years ago.

15:38.404 --> 15:40.673
- Mm-hmm.

15:40.774 --> 15:43.759
- And I had huge dreams.

15:43.109 --> 15:44.911
And then I had a baby boy,

15:45.779 --> 15:46.645
and it was kind of time

15:45.779 --> 15:46.645
to retire.

15:46.745 --> 15:48.782
- You can't retire now.

15:46.745 --> 15:48.782
Cher's not retired.

15:48.881 --> 15:49.915
- I don't want to retire,

15:50.830 --> 15:51.183
'cause my son

15:50.830 --> 15:51.183
is old enough now,

15:51.283 --> 15:52.552
and he doesn't need me anymore,

15:51.283 --> 15:52.552
so.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.870
- So let's talk about Cher.

15:54.187 --> 15:56.221
Adam mentioned Cher-isms.

15:56.322 --> 15:59.919
- You know, the gays are really

15:56.322 --> 15:59.919
specific about what they want

15:59.125 --> 16:01.269
their Cher impersonators

15:59.125 --> 16:01.269
to be able to do.

16:01.610 --> 16:03.863
You know, there's the isms.

16:01.610 --> 16:03.863
They're tried and true.

16:04.299 --> 16:06.633
- There are certain ways

16:04.299 --> 16:06.633
that she walks,

16:06.732 --> 16:08.679
<i>moves, commands the stage.</i>

16:08.168 --> 16:10.769
<i>It's what the Cher fans</i>

16:08.168 --> 16:10.769
<i>expect to see.</i>

16:10.870 --> 16:12.672
Are you up for me

16:10.870 --> 16:12.672
completely amping it up?

16:12.772 --> 16:14.399
- I'm ready. Let's go.

16:12.772 --> 16:14.399
- All right, let's do it.

16:14.740 --> 16:15.207
- Hey, Lori.

16:14.740 --> 16:15.207
- Hi.

16:15.307 --> 16:16.241
- How are you?

16:15.307 --> 16:16.241
- I'm good.

16:16.342 --> 16:17.509
- I'm Kuk.

16:16.342 --> 16:17.509
- Nice to meet you.

16:17.610 --> 16:19.778
- So nice to meet you.

16:17.610 --> 16:19.778
I loved your performance.

16:19.879 --> 16:20.779
- Oh, thank you.

16:20.879 --> 16:23.950
* Oh, you come to me

16:24.500 --> 16:25.485
- I love it. So good.

16:25.585 --> 16:27.419
- * Simply the best

16:27.519 --> 16:29.121
- You know, she has

16:27.519 --> 16:29.121
this natural grit.

16:29.221 --> 16:32.524
You have to learn how to use

16:29.221 --> 16:32.524
that grit in a powerful way.

16:32.625 --> 16:35.894
- When I first started,

16:32.625 --> 16:35.894
it was a struggle singing four

16:36.620 --> 16:38.298
sets a night in a smoky bar.

16:36.620 --> 16:38.298
- Yeah.

16:38.398 --> 16:39.432
- You know, stuff like that.

16:38.398 --> 16:39.432
So.

16:39.532 --> 16:40.633
- Trying to--

16:39.532 --> 16:40.633
- Yeah.

16:40.734 --> 16:42.534
So I literally sounded,

16:42.634 --> 16:44.937
I felt, like a dead cat,

16:45.710 --> 16:47.173
'cause I was trying

16:45.710 --> 16:47.173
to get that screechy...

16:47.273 --> 16:49.750
- Okay.

16:47.273 --> 16:49.750
- Kind of raspy thing.

16:49.109 --> 16:50.110
- Right.

16:50.210 --> 16:53.513
- But then I started

16:50.210 --> 16:53.513
to lose my voice.

16:53.613 --> 16:54.813
- Gotcha.

16:54.913 --> 16:56.615
- So I'm still in protection

16:54.913 --> 16:56.615
mode, without--

16:56.716 --> 16:57.917
- I totally get it.

16:56.716 --> 16:57.917
- Yeah, yeah.

16:58.840 --> 17:00.519
- So I'm thinking we can

16:58.840 --> 17:00.519
just do a slight alter.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.220
It's just enunciating more.

17:02.549 --> 17:04.356
I came up with something

17:02.549 --> 17:04.356
that--it's tailored for you.

17:04.457 --> 17:07.359
We're gonna put the wig on

17:04.457 --> 17:07.359
and go into full Tina mode.

17:07.460 --> 17:08.361
- Okay.

17:07.460 --> 17:08.361
- Ester's notes

17:08.461 --> 17:10.960
were rasp, grit,

17:10.195 --> 17:12.132
and I also wanted

17:10.195 --> 17:12.132
to add enunciation,

17:12.231 --> 17:13.732
'cause you can't have one

17:12.231 --> 17:13.732
without the other.

17:13.833 --> 17:14.867
So let's do Tina.

17:15.349 --> 17:16.736
- Okay.

17:15.349 --> 17:16.736
- Adam mentioned Cher-isms.

17:16.836 --> 17:18.171
- Yeah.

17:16.836 --> 17:18.171
- What's the biggest one?

17:18.270 --> 17:20.173
- Well, I mean, it would be

17:18.270 --> 17:20.173
that one, I would think.

17:20.272 --> 17:21.708
- Or--

17:20.272 --> 17:21.708
- Or, yeah.

17:21.807 --> 17:23.576
- So we've got a little bit

17:21.807 --> 17:23.576
of a hair flip,

17:23.676 --> 17:24.877
<i>and we've got this happening.</i>

17:25.450 --> 17:26.311
Go.

17:25.450 --> 17:26.311
Can you walk forward?

17:26.413 --> 17:28.381
And now hand in the position.

17:26.413 --> 17:28.381
So, if I count you in...

17:28.480 --> 17:30.115
- Uh-huh.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.115
- Five. Six. Seven.

17:30.215 --> 17:32.519
Walk in with me.

17:30.215 --> 17:32.519
Good.

17:32.618 --> 17:35.549
Good. take a stance. Go.

17:35.880 --> 17:36.890
Yeah. But you're giving me--

17:37.569 --> 17:38.157
- More attitude is

17:37.569 --> 17:38.157
what you're saying?

17:38.258 --> 17:40.326
- More attitude and conviction.

17:40.426 --> 17:42.228
Go. Good.

17:42.327 --> 17:43.896
Stop and hold.

17:44.640 --> 17:46.532
Don't look at me.

17:44.640 --> 17:46.532
- [laughs]

17:46.633 --> 17:48.680
You're hard.

17:48.134 --> 17:50.436
- You keep checking in on me

17:48.134 --> 17:50.436
to see, "Did I do that right?"

17:50.537 --> 17:51.871
you're gonna shake out

17:50.537 --> 17:51.871
the nerves,

17:51.971 --> 17:54.473
and you're gonna commit

17:51.971 --> 17:54.473
to hitting the Cher-ism.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.576
Even in rehearsal,

17:54.574 --> 17:56.576
she's nervous,

17:56.675 --> 17:58.912
so there's some breaking

17:56.675 --> 17:58.912
through that needs to happen.

17:59.789 --> 18:00.547
- So now, going into Tina...

17:59.789 --> 18:00.547
- Got it. Okay.

18:00.646 --> 18:02.515
- Put that rasp in it.

18:00.646 --> 18:02.515
Put that thing in it.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.817
Every note is on purpose. So--

18:02.615 --> 18:04.817
- Okay.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.487
- One other thing about being

18:04.917 --> 18:07.487
in protection mode--

18:07.586 --> 18:08.721
just let it go a little bit.

18:08.821 --> 18:09.722
You're gonna be fine.

18:09.823 --> 18:11.523
Like, your vocal cords are so,

18:11.624 --> 18:14.527
so seasoned and so trained,

18:11.624 --> 18:14.527
you're not gonna damage them.

18:14.626 --> 18:17.299
- Okay.

18:14.626 --> 18:17.299
- A one. Two. Three.

18:17.630 --> 18:20.165
- * My emotion running high

18:17.630 --> 18:20.165
for you *

18:20.266 --> 18:21.367
- Snap that "got to."

18:21.468 --> 18:25.337
- * And I got to tell you

18:21.468 --> 18:25.337
what to do *

18:25.438 --> 18:28.508
* Need you to love me now

18:28.607 --> 18:30.759
- Yep. The key thing.

18:30.175 --> 18:31.411
That last thing that you

18:30.175 --> 18:31.411
did--

18:31.510 --> 18:34.513
* Need you to love me now

18:34.614 --> 18:36.415
You don't need to elongate

18:34.614 --> 18:36.415
anything like that.

18:36.516 --> 18:37.416
- Okay.

18:36.516 --> 18:37.416
- Short and sweet

18:37.517 --> 18:38.417
are the best things.

18:38.518 --> 18:40.886
* Love me now

18:41.539 --> 18:42.880
Get in, get out.

18:42.188 --> 18:43.556
- What do you like about Cher?

18:43.655 --> 18:45.892
- She hold up like this

18:43.655 --> 18:45.892
when she does "Believe," maybe.

18:46.589 --> 18:47.326
- Oh, can you give me

18:46.589 --> 18:47.326
a little bit of that?

18:47.426 --> 18:48.394
- Yeah.

18:47.426 --> 18:48.394
- That would be great.

18:48.494 --> 18:50.697
- Let me see your posture.

18:48.494 --> 18:50.697
- Mm-hmm.

18:50.797 --> 18:53.566
- Face the light.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.969
Now eyes forward.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.969
You always look down.

18:56.690 --> 18:57.136
- I do?

18:56.690 --> 18:57.136
- Yeah.

18:57.237 --> 18:58.404
- Oh.

18:57.237 --> 18:58.404
- Cher focuses straight ahead.

18:58.505 --> 18:59.572
You tend to look down.

18:59.673 --> 19:00.773
- Okay.

18:59.673 --> 19:00.773
Okay, I'm gonna work on that.

19:00.874 --> 19:02.307
- A little bit might

19:00.874 --> 19:02.307
just be the nerves.

19:02.409 --> 19:03.375
- Yeah.

19:03.476 --> 19:04.544
- But I want you to open

19:03.476 --> 19:04.544
all this up.

19:04.644 --> 19:05.878
- Okay.

19:04.644 --> 19:05.878
- Right? And have fun with it.

19:06.119 --> 19:06.880
- Okay.

19:06.119 --> 19:06.880
- That's what it's all about.

19:07.130 --> 19:08.114
- Yeah. True.

19:08.213 --> 19:11.116
- * Need you to love me now

19:11.217 --> 19:15.320
- Yes!

19:11.217 --> 19:15.320
- * Need you to love me now

19:15.422 --> 19:18.357
- As you're doing Tina,

19:15.422 --> 19:18.357
move your mouth a lot.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.160
Get that character.

19:20.259 --> 19:22.729
Round, but make sure you

19:20.259 --> 19:22.729
hitting them notes, all right?

19:22.828 --> 19:24.396
- Yes.

19:22.828 --> 19:24.396
- Walk it out. Go.

19:24.497 --> 19:25.565
Longer strides.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.329
That's better

19:25.664 --> 19:27.329
with the left arm, too.

19:27.133 --> 19:30.470

27:36.955 --> 27:38.825
"Clash of the Cover Bands."

27:38.924 --> 27:40.930
- Whoo!

27:40.192 --> 27:42.595
- We saw two spectacular show

27:40.192 --> 27:42.595
stoppers tonight,

27:42.695 --> 27:44.297
Annika Weaver as Cher

27:44.396 --> 27:47.366
versus Lori Mitchell-Gay

27:44.396 --> 27:47.366
as Tina Turner!

27:47.467 --> 27:49.568
- Whoo!

27:49.669 --> 27:50.869
- This is not gonna be easy,

27:50.970 --> 27:53.972
but judges, it's time

27:50.970 --> 27:53.972
to give your verdict.

27:54.740 --> 27:57.977
Which of these show stoppers

27:54.740 --> 27:57.977
shut it down tonight?

27:58.779 --> 28:01.815
- I feel like you're seeing

27:58.779 --> 28:01.815
Cher and Tina Turner

28:01.914 --> 28:05.509
changing outfits, running back

28:01.914 --> 28:05.509
and forth the stage,

28:05.151 --> 28:07.200
coming out, giving their all,

28:05.151 --> 28:07.200
laying it down.

28:07.869 --> 28:09.622
That is what Tina does.

28:07.869 --> 28:09.622
That's what Cher does.

28:09.722 --> 28:11.910
That is what

28:09.722 --> 28:11.910
a show stopper does.

28:11.191 --> 28:12.525
[cheers and applause]

28:12.625 --> 28:16.395
Like, I couldn't get my

28:12.625 --> 28:16.395
tired ass up there and run...

28:16.496 --> 28:18.198
- Same!

28:16.496 --> 28:18.198
- Up and down that thing.

28:18.298 --> 28:20.666
So, good job.

28:20.767 --> 28:23.336
Lori, you know, the reason

28:20.767 --> 28:23.336
why Tina had a raspy voice

28:23.435 --> 28:24.770
is she was always fighting.

28:24.871 --> 28:26.172
She was a warrior.

28:26.271 --> 28:29.608
So that's the reason why

28:26.271 --> 28:29.608
I wanted you to have more grit.

28:29.709 --> 28:33.278
- [sustaining note]

28:33.380 --> 28:35.248
- Every note is on purpose.

28:35.347 --> 28:37.717
- Kuk really helped me

28:35.347 --> 28:37.717
bring that raspiness out.

28:37.817 --> 28:39.586
* Me now

28:39.685 --> 28:41.421
- You don't need to elongate

28:39.685 --> 28:41.421
anything like that.

28:41.520 --> 28:42.422
- Okay.

28:41.520 --> 28:42.422
- Short and sweet

28:42.521 --> 28:43.923
are the best thing.

28:44.569 --> 28:47.292
- He gave me a lot of really

28:44.569 --> 28:47.292
great tips that I'm gonna use,

28:47.394 --> 28:50.497
not just here

28:47.394 --> 28:50.497
but, like, when I leave here.

28:50.596 --> 28:52.650
<i>- I love your fire.</i>

28:52.980 --> 28:55.468
I love the work that you've

28:52.980 --> 28:55.468
put into studying Tina Turner.

28:55.567 --> 28:58.104
- This is the battle of

28:55.567 --> 28:58.104
the Show Stoppers,

28:58.203 --> 29:01.674
<i>and I want to be the winner.</i>

29:01.775 --> 29:04.344
- You did great.

29:01.775 --> 29:04.344
You gave us the raspy voice.

29:04.443 --> 29:08.647
I was like,

29:04.443 --> 29:08.647
"Wow, there's Tina!" you know?

29:08.748 --> 29:11.170
So then, when I seen you,

29:08.748 --> 29:11.170
Annika--

29:11.839 --> 29:13.118
we needed you to come out here

29:11.839 --> 29:13.118
and do what you did.

29:13.219 --> 29:15.210
The movement--there was growth.

29:15.549 --> 29:16.789
[cheers and applause]

29:16.890 --> 29:19.526
- It's Cher!

29:19.625 --> 29:20.859
- Since you haven't been

29:19.625 --> 29:20.859
doing this for a while,

29:21.269 --> 29:21.928
there's the isms...

29:22.279 --> 29:23.630
- Show them.

29:22.279 --> 29:23.630
- That impersonators do.

29:23.163 --> 29:25.230
She does this,

29:23.163 --> 29:25.230
like, love sign thing.

29:25.330 --> 29:26.799
- Now go longer strides.

29:26.900 --> 29:29.349
<i>- Adam wanted me to learn</i>

29:26.900 --> 29:29.349
<i>a little bit more Cher-isms.</i>

29:29.134 --> 29:30.436
- There!

29:30.537 --> 29:32.305
- I definitely feel stronger

29:30.537 --> 29:32.305
when I worked with Ray.

29:32.404 --> 29:34.807
- Yes! Have fun with it.

29:32.404 --> 29:34.807
<i>- I haven't done this a lot.</i>

29:34.907 --> 29:36.710
Seeing that it was

29:34.907 --> 29:36.710
just my second time,

29:36.809 --> 29:39.645
I'm still learning as I go.

29:39.746 --> 29:41.748
<i>- I saw a lot of Cher-isms.</i>

29:41.847 --> 29:43.249
I'm so proud of you.

29:43.349 --> 29:45.117
<i>- This is an opportunity</i>

29:43.349 --> 29:45.117
<i>for me to show</i>

29:45.218 --> 29:47.529
<i>all the hard work</i>

29:45.218 --> 29:47.529
<i>through the years.</i>

29:47.869 --> 29:48.621
<i>This could definitely</i>

29:47.869 --> 29:48.621
<i>change my life.</i>

29:48.721 --> 29:51.124
- I just want to say that

29:48.721 --> 29:51.124
it's really inspiring to see

29:51.223 --> 29:53.125
that you are both up there

29:51.223 --> 29:53.125
living your dream.

29:53.226 --> 29:56.328
You are never too old

29:53.226 --> 29:56.328
to do what you love,

29:56.429 --> 29:58.163
to perform, to inspire.

29:58.263 --> 30:00.099
- Yes! Love that.

30:00.200 --> 30:03.803
- Absolutely! Amen!

30:03.903 --> 30:08.575
- And I know

30:03.903 --> 30:08.575
we have to pick one, so...

30:08.674 --> 30:13.946
the winner is...

30:14.470 --> 30:15.347
Ms. Tina Turner.

30:15.448 --> 30:19.451
<i>- * I lift you up</i>

30:15.448 --> 30:19.451

30:19.551 --> 30:22.454

for loving me,

30:42.342 --> 30:43.276
for loving Tina.

30:43.375 --> 30:47.579
She is a survivor.

30:43.375 --> 30:47.579
I am a survivor.

30:47.681 --> 30:53.859
And this is for my babies.

30:47.681 --> 30:53.859
This is for them. Yes.

Show me that. Hey!

31:27.953 --> 31:29.154
onto the seat of the chair.

Hey.
