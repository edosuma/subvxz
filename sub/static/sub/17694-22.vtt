WEBVTT

00:02.303 --> 00:04.036
Dad, I'm gonna be late
for registration.

00:04.038 --> 00:06.205
Well, you're already two years
late for graduation, so...

00:06.207 --> 00:07.606
Just take a side street.

00:07.608 --> 00:08.941
Hayley, you were right here

00:08.943 --> 00:10.976
when I enter our destination
on the nav.

00:10.978 --> 00:12.711
That's the plan
and I'm sticking to it.

00:12.713 --> 00:14.279
So, you're just gonna
drive behind

00:14.281 --> 00:16.048
the Bazooka Sharks
championship parade.

00:16.050 --> 00:17.316
Yeah.

00:17.318 --> 00:19.485
(cheers and applause)

00:19.487 --> 00:21.520
Obviously you're not a planner.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.022
I mean, the course catalogue
you're looking at

00:23.024 --> 00:24.523
is a pizza menu.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.492
Aww, so black olives
doesn't meet

00:26.494 --> 00:28.293
my Cultural Studies
requirement.

00:28.295 --> 00:30.229
All I'm saying is that
you lack focus,

00:30.231 --> 00:31.997
and that's what a plan
gives you.

00:31.999 --> 00:34.867
Maybe if you stuck to a plan,
you wouldn't be such a --

00:34.869 --> 00:36.702
well, I wouldn't say
a failure.

00:36.704 --> 00:38.237
Oh.
Well what would you say, then?

00:38.239 --> 00:41.040
I won't say a failure.
But you keep saying that.

00:41.042 --> 00:42.474
"Failure" is the only word
you're saying.

00:42.476 --> 00:44.376
Your words, not mine.

00:46.580 --> 00:49.081
(snoring)

00:49.083 --> 00:51.150
Uh, sir?
(gasps)

00:51.152 --> 00:53.986
And I say, "Look, I'm happy
you're having your night."

00:53.988 --> 00:57.389
So underneath it, there's love.

00:57.391 --> 01:00.526
'Cause when the chips are down,
are you there for each other?

01:00.528 --> 01:01.994
Are you doing this,

01:01.996 --> 01:05.597
"you're selfish,"
"you're unwieldy" stuff?

01:05.599 --> 01:08.700
Is this still about
the arms dealer mission?

01:08.702 --> 01:11.603
This is about any relationship
you're building.

01:11.605 --> 01:14.373
(groans) Maybe a single diagram
will help.

01:14.375 --> 01:17.776
There's still that, uh,
important phrase.

01:17.778 --> 01:19.411
Important phrase.

01:19.413 --> 01:22.514
Oh, but he has a different
important phrase

01:22.516 --> 01:24.516
that's underneath it,
you know?

01:24.518 --> 01:26.418
So that's one version of it.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.954
This is where it breaks down
in my mind.

01:28.956 --> 01:33.225
I mean, that could be a cleaner
versus un-cleaner ring to it.

01:33.227 --> 01:35.294
Does any of this make sense?

01:35.296 --> 01:37.229
No, no. It totally makes sense
what you're saying, sir.

01:37.231 --> 01:39.631
Good. Smith, you'll head up
the mission.

01:39.633 --> 01:43.402
And don't forget this part.

01:43.404 --> 01:47.372
Ohh.
Ahh.

01:47.374 --> 01:50.109
(theme music plays)

01:50.111 --> 01:52.611
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

01:52.613 --> 01:56.482
¶ I got a feelin' that
it's gonna be a wonderful day ¶

01:56.484 --> 01:59.485
¶ The sun in the sky
has a smile on his face ¶

01:59.487 --> 02:03.222
¶ And he's shinin' a salute
to the American race ¶

02:05.793 --> 02:09.294
¶ Oh, boy, it's swell to say ¶

02:09.296 --> 02:11.597
¶ Good -- ¶
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

02:11.599 --> 02:14.233
Aah!

02:14.235 --> 02:17.369
¶<i> Good morning, U.S.A.</i> ¶

02:19.907 --> 02:23.809
I got the recipe for this soup
from a magazine.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.577
That's great, Francine.

02:25.579 --> 02:28.981
Your quest for knowledge is
taking you to incredible places.

02:28.983 --> 02:31.850
Well, what do you think?

02:31.852 --> 02:33.118
(vomits)

02:33.120 --> 02:35.087
It's not your soup, Mom.

02:35.089 --> 02:38.857
My husband is getting
into hallucinogenic teas.

02:38.859 --> 02:40.926
See?
This is what I'm talking about.

02:40.928 --> 02:43.095
What's that, Dad?
Your sister ran off

02:43.097 --> 02:45.330
and got married with no idea
what she was doing.

02:45.332 --> 02:46.965
You had no plan!

02:46.967 --> 02:49.168
And now you're surprised the guy
turns out to be a bum?

02:49.170 --> 02:51.837
(gagging, vomits)
Gross! Gross!

02:51.839 --> 02:54.673
Worse! Worse!

02:54.675 --> 02:57.376
Dad, no plan could have
predicted my husband

02:57.378 --> 02:58.977
turning into this --

02:58.979 --> 03:00.979
tripping on tea
and hallucinating

03:00.981 --> 03:02.281
he was on another planet.

03:02.283 --> 03:03.649
But it happened, babe.

03:03.651 --> 03:06.451
On that trip,
I lived an entire lifetime.

03:06.453 --> 03:10.122
And I dedicated it to mastering
an exotic musical instrument.

03:10.124 --> 03:12.624
(laughing) Whoa!
Kindle on sleep mode.

03:12.626 --> 03:15.294
I think I'm gonna have to see
this one all the way through.

03:15.296 --> 03:17.696
Look. You don't have to be
as aimless as him.

03:17.698 --> 03:20.165
Come to work with me -- you'll
see a bunch of guys

03:20.167 --> 03:22.000
whose lives depend on planning.

03:22.002 --> 03:23.335
I guess it couldn't hurt.

03:23.337 --> 03:26.405
The soup is from
<i> Bicycling Magazine.</i>

03:26.407 --> 03:30.976
It's called "Homemade Paste
For Patching a Flat Tire."

03:35.849 --> 03:37.583
All right, Jeff.
Set the scene.

03:37.585 --> 03:40.586
You drank this tea and you were
transported to a planet

03:40.588 --> 03:42.087
called...
Gewee.

03:42.089 --> 03:44.089
Gewee!
What a cute name!

03:44.091 --> 03:46.425
And there you played an
instrument.

03:46.427 --> 03:48.327
The turin.
The turin!

03:48.329 --> 03:50.529
Marvelous!
Just marvelous!

03:50.531 --> 03:52.397
Roger, are you teasing Jeff
or what?

03:52.399 --> 03:55.901
Do you believe this?
Steve, I am today trying to,

03:55.903 --> 03:59.504
for once in my life,
have a tiny bit of fun.

03:59.506 --> 04:01.940
I just need to buy a turin,
play it for Hayley,

04:01.942 --> 04:03.842
and show her I'm not
totally crazy.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.510
Can I help you guys?

04:05.512 --> 04:08.080
I'm looking for a turin.
I've never heard
of a turin, man.

04:08.082 --> 04:10.015
This turkey's never heard of
a turin.

04:10.017 --> 04:13.185
It's like a lute
and a bagpipe in one,

04:13.187 --> 04:16.722
where the body of the lute
is the bag of the bagpipe.

04:16.724 --> 04:18.690
Uh, but how can --

04:18.692 --> 04:21.126
On the turin, the body is soft
because it's made from

04:21.128 --> 04:22.628
the skin
of a yarelwood fruit.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.529
He became the master
of this instrument

04:24.531 --> 04:26.131
while on a
shamanistic voyage.

04:26.133 --> 04:28.867
A master of the instrument,
Roger.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.736
I'm no Pu Aberlmarl.

04:30.738 --> 04:32.237
Of course!
No one's saying that.

04:32.239 --> 04:34.806
But I think I play pretty well

04:34.808 --> 04:36.608
for a guy with just
one mouth.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.076
Maybe you could
make one, Jeff.

04:38.078 --> 04:39.711
I'd really like to hear
this thing.

04:39.713 --> 04:42.881
Imagine a person who didn't want
to hear the turin played.

04:42.883 --> 04:45.450
I can't even start.
I mean, what --

04:45.452 --> 04:48.453
Okay, okay. I need to put that
kind of person out of my mind.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.989
Because that kind of person
makes me furious!

04:50.991 --> 04:52.658
Oh, no.
Look.

04:52.660 --> 04:55.627
Let's just chill and get some
yarelwood tomorrow.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.796
Female yarelwood.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.798
I don't want that thing
biting me.

04:59.800 --> 05:03.135
(laughs) Fun!
That's a fun detail.

05:03.137 --> 05:06.772
So, Bullock puts a plan together
and you guys follow it through.

05:06.774 --> 05:08.607
What is the plan exactly?

05:08.609 --> 05:11.243
It's right here. We open it
at the rendezvous point.

05:11.245 --> 05:14.613
Then we surprise and scoop up
a group of unarmed

05:14.615 --> 05:16.348
Russian arms dealers.

05:16.350 --> 05:18.984
H-how can a-arms dealers
be unarmed?

05:18.986 --> 05:20.786
That's what
I've been saying!

05:20.788 --> 05:22.521
We're at rendezvous
coordinates.

05:22.523 --> 05:24.256
I don't think we should
park here.

05:24.258 --> 05:27.659
This van doesn't blend in
the way Bullock thinks it does.

05:27.661 --> 05:31.196
STAN: It's called camouflage,
and it works.

05:31.198 --> 05:33.031
Not in the nature shows
I've seen.

05:33.033 --> 05:35.500
Zebras are always getting
munched up.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.969
Everyone just re-lax.

05:37.971 --> 05:39.805
I have Bullock's plan
right here.

05:39.807 --> 05:41.673
Alpha Team.
Cool, right?

05:41.675 --> 05:43.608
What's it say?

05:43.610 --> 05:44.976
Hold on.
What?

05:44.978 --> 05:47.779
It says "HOLD ON."
Hold on!

05:47.781 --> 05:50.449
(glass breaks)

05:50.451 --> 05:52.117
That must have been Bravo Team!
We're in!

05:52.119 --> 05:53.352
Let's roll, Dick!

05:53.354 --> 05:54.920
(horn blares)

05:57.624 --> 06:00.492
See?! They're unarmed!
Engage!

06:00.494 --> 06:03.195
What?!
They all have guns!

06:03.197 --> 06:05.364
Remember!
The plan was to hold on!

06:05.366 --> 06:07.799
Screw that! Run!

06:07.801 --> 06:09.368
(gunfire, glass shatters)

06:09.370 --> 06:11.436
(tires squeal)

06:13.974 --> 06:16.341
Oh, great, Hayley.
We abandoned the plan.

06:16.343 --> 06:18.977
Now Bravo Team's gonna get
all the glory.

06:18.979 --> 06:21.813
MAN: Aah!

06:23.851 --> 06:26.585
I can't believe you almost
got me killed!

06:26.587 --> 06:28.186
There's something going on
with Bullock.

06:28.188 --> 06:29.855
But don't give up on
making plans.

06:29.857 --> 06:31.356
Oh, okay.
How about this?

06:31.358 --> 06:33.658
I<i> plan</i>
to go out and get wasted.

06:33.660 --> 06:36.395
I just don't want you wandering
aimlessly through life.

06:36.397 --> 06:39.097
You're better than that.
You always want me to be better.

06:39.099 --> 06:41.533
Why can't you just like me
for who I am?

06:41.535 --> 06:45.237
Hey, guys. We were just watching
some boob tube over here.

06:45.239 --> 06:47.439
Out of earshot,
if you were wondering.

06:47.441 --> 06:50.175
Yeah!
It's a show where

06:50.177 --> 06:52.944
celebrities dive into a pool
and get scores.

06:52.946 --> 06:56.014
So...
So, that's what we are doing.

06:58.185 --> 07:01.686
¶¶

07:01.688 --> 07:03.789
What's wrong?
(scoffs)

07:03.791 --> 07:06.725
No. Come on. No!

07:06.727 --> 07:08.627
Don't be sad!

07:08.629 --> 07:11.630
Listen to this deejay.
He's amazing.

07:11.632 --> 07:15.600
You know, he's been winning
every night for two weeks!

07:15.602 --> 07:19.704
Tears?
No tears.

07:19.706 --> 07:20.939
No.

07:20.941 --> 07:24.543
Can I have some money?

07:24.545 --> 07:26.211
(giggles)

07:29.283 --> 07:30.982
(electronic music plays)

07:35.389 --> 07:37.989
DJ Buttercup in the house!

07:37.991 --> 07:41.159
I'm here all night -- except
when I take a break at 3:00.

07:41.161 --> 07:42.928
ALL: Aw!

07:42.930 --> 07:45.497
To have sex with at least five
of you.

07:45.499 --> 07:48.567
(cheers and applause)

07:54.475 --> 07:57.275
So, Hayley told you I've been
deejaying every night

07:57.277 --> 07:58.743
for the last two weeks?

07:58.745 --> 08:00.745
Right, and over that time,
the number of agents

08:00.747 --> 08:02.914
who are alive has dropped
radically.

08:02.916 --> 08:05.083
And?
Well, maybe it has something

08:05.085 --> 08:06.952
to do with these extremely
dangerous missions

08:06.954 --> 08:08.286
you've been planning.

08:08.288 --> 08:09.988
I mean,
have you been sleeping?

08:09.990 --> 08:11.823
I don't need sleep anymore!

08:11.825 --> 08:14.259
Not since I bought all this
trucker speed.

08:14.261 --> 08:17.529
I'm done wasting
my creativity on dreams.

08:17.531 --> 08:20.031
Now I channel it all into
my work.

08:20.033 --> 08:23.001
Your deejay work or your
National Security work?

08:23.003 --> 08:24.469
You think there's
a difference?

08:24.471 --> 08:26.872
Sure.
It started innocently enough.

08:26.874 --> 08:31.443
I got into deejaying to bang the
teenage girls high on sex drugs.

08:31.445 --> 08:35.113
But then I realized there
was a darker side.

08:35.115 --> 08:38.683
What if the terrorists
go after our beats next?

08:38.685 --> 08:41.553
I-I-I don't --
H-how could they even do that?

08:41.555 --> 08:44.623
I'm deep in the deejay world
protecting American freedoms,

08:44.625 --> 08:47.692
and I'm gonna stay there
until someone defeats me.

08:47.694 --> 08:51.563
If you want me to stop, you'll
have to dethrone me yourself.

08:51.565 --> 08:53.899
Sir, I'm not a deejay.
Of course you aren't.

08:53.901 --> 08:56.902
So I suggest you focus on your
next mission.

08:56.904 --> 08:58.637
Another one?
Right away?

08:58.639 --> 09:01.506
You and your team will travel to
Mecca to film a shot-for-shot

09:01.508 --> 09:04.142
remake of the scene in "2001"

09:04.144 --> 09:06.311
where the apes fight around
the monolith.

09:06.313 --> 09:08.313
Like, in monkey suits?

09:08.315 --> 09:09.681
Around the black cube?

09:09.683 --> 09:11.716
That's the most sacred site
in Islam.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.818
Your monkey movie is
top priority.

09:13.820 --> 09:16.855
I'm already hearing
Oscar whispers.

09:16.857 --> 09:19.257
Or some sort of whispering.

09:19.259 --> 09:21.326
Do you hear voices, Smith?

09:21.328 --> 09:23.562
Yes. They're telling me if I
don't want to die

09:23.564 --> 09:26.698
in monkey costume, I need
to learn how to deejay.

09:26.700 --> 09:30.035
And that was "Let's Get Lost"
by Chet Baker,

09:30.037 --> 09:32.437
who either fell or was thrown
to his death

09:32.439 --> 09:34.706
from a hotel room window
in Amsterdam.

09:34.708 --> 09:36.841
I like to think he was thrown.

09:36.843 --> 09:40.579
(laughs) Is this what you
think deejaying is?

09:40.581 --> 09:43.448
Speaking of windows, this is
"Come to My Window,"

09:43.450 --> 09:46.518
made famous by public lesbian
Melissa Etheridge.

09:46.520 --> 09:49.721
ROGER:
¶ Come to my window ¶

09:49.723 --> 09:54.059
¶ Crawl inside, wait by
the light of the moon ¶

09:54.061 --> 09:56.795
<i> This</i> is deejaying.

09:56.797 --> 09:58.630
That's deejaying?

09:58.632 --> 10:00.899
Well, how am I supposed to learn
that in two days?

10:00.901 --> 10:04.035
Not by playing "Roger Goes Down
on Lilith Fair."

10:06.573 --> 10:10.241
I got no yarelwood in inventory.
Is it called anything else?

10:10.243 --> 10:13.745
Well I guess the ancient word
for it is dragonwood,

10:13.747 --> 10:16.548
which makes sense because it's
used to make an instrument

10:16.550 --> 10:17.816
that soothes dragons.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.584
That makes a lot of sense.
Does it?

10:19.586 --> 10:21.453
'Cause it seems crazy.
Okay, guys.

10:21.455 --> 10:23.088
I have a lot of work to do.

10:23.090 --> 10:25.824
Yarelwood is the most common
wood on the planet Gewee.

10:25.826 --> 10:27.993
Gotcha.

10:27.995 --> 10:30.595
Maybe there's a wood
like yarelwood.

10:30.597 --> 10:33.465
Really, any wood from a tree
that grows when you sleep by it

10:33.467 --> 10:35.500
and swell it with
your dreams!

10:35.502 --> 10:38.003
Maybe plywood?

10:38.005 --> 10:40.438
What, I don't know how you
grow plywood.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.841
(laughs)
Just when I thought I'd heard

10:42.843 --> 10:45.677
every wood joke there was,
I hear a fresh one.

10:45.679 --> 10:47.846
Help yourself to the scrap wood
around back.

10:47.848 --> 10:49.848
(chuckles)
You've earned it.

10:49.850 --> 10:52.484
Did you get
my joke back there?

10:52.486 --> 10:54.586
I don't know.
What was it?

10:54.588 --> 10:56.354
I don't know.

10:58.859 --> 11:01.526
And he was talking into his lamp
like it was a microphone.

11:01.528 --> 11:04.162
Anyway, he looked so --

11:04.164 --> 11:06.131
Stupid.
I know, I looked stupid.

11:06.133 --> 11:08.266
Plus I owe Snot
concert tickets.

11:08.268 --> 11:10.435
He called for Steve, and he
was the ninth caller.

11:10.437 --> 11:12.003
Anyway, I'm in way over
my head here.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.471
Can you help me plan
my deejay set?

11:13.473 --> 11:15.607
You can't plan a deejay set.

11:15.609 --> 11:17.942
You've got to read the room,
go with the flow,

11:17.944 --> 11:20.679
know when to heat things up
and when to cool things out.

11:20.681 --> 11:22.347
But I've always needed
a plan.

11:22.349 --> 11:23.782
Well, then, you're gonna lose
to Bullock.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.617
I'm gonna lose more
than that.

11:25.619 --> 11:28.319
'Cause if I can't beat him,
I have to lead his next mission.

11:28.321 --> 11:30.555
Wait, he --
he planned another mission?

11:30.557 --> 11:32.957
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no.

11:32.959 --> 11:34.993
Th-that's suicide!

11:34.995 --> 11:38.229
Stan, this suicide mission
sounds...risky.

11:38.231 --> 11:41.533
Risky? How? Suicide's just that
thing when you mix

11:41.535 --> 11:44.469
all the sodas together
into one super soda.

11:44.471 --> 11:46.137
Here, Dad, drink this tea.

11:46.139 --> 11:47.906
Uck!
That was terrible!

11:47.908 --> 11:50.642
It was Jeff's Brazilian tea.
You drugged me?!

11:50.644 --> 11:52.310
Dad, you're out of time.

11:52.312 --> 11:53.845
Maybe this will
rewire your mind,

11:53.847 --> 11:55.413
help you improvise
and beat Bullock.

11:55.415 --> 11:56.681
Ooh.

11:56.683 --> 11:58.850
I haven't had mushroom tea
in ages.

11:58.852 --> 12:02.087
What? You did it last weekend
at the Sheraton Hotel --

12:02.089 --> 12:05.256
--ton Hotel bar.
Let's go there.

12:05.258 --> 12:08.460
I'm starting...to feel
something.

12:11.398 --> 12:12.997
Dad, are you okay?

12:12.999 --> 12:14.332
I think I should sit down.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.701
Um, you already fell down.

12:16.703 --> 12:18.203
You're lying by your
throw-up bucket.

12:18.205 --> 12:20.772
(bones click melodically)

12:24.010 --> 12:26.811
(electronic music playing)

12:38.291 --> 12:40.859
(eyeballs popping)

12:45.365 --> 12:48.133
Dad?
Dad, are you okay?

12:48.135 --> 12:50.101
Dad, are you okay?

12:50.103 --> 12:51.970
(music resumes)

12:51.972 --> 12:54.539
(bullock laughing)

13:01.882 --> 13:04.149
BULLOCK: Oscar whispers.

13:04.151 --> 13:06.718
(eagle screeches)

13:08.822 --> 13:10.822
(bullock laughing)

13:10.824 --> 13:14.025
(music continues)

13:22.803 --> 13:25.503
HAYLEY: Go with the flow!
Go with the flow.

13:25.505 --> 13:28.239
Go with the flow.
Go with the flow.
Go with the flow...

13:28.241 --> 13:31.242
I got this.
I can go with the flow.

13:31.244 --> 13:34.245
I can beat Bullock.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.681

13:36.683 --> 13:38.683

13:38.685 --> 13:41.319
(electronic music playing)

13:43.456 --> 13:45.924
(cheering)

13:48.328 --> 13:50.695
We have a new champion!

13:50.697 --> 13:53.965
Let's hear it for
Standard Deviation!

13:53.967 --> 13:56.367
(cheers and applause)

13:56.369 --> 13:59.304
You did it, Dad!
You improvised!

13:59.306 --> 14:01.773
Nope. I just downloaded a set
from YouTube

14:01.775 --> 14:03.007
onto this zip drive.

14:03.009 --> 14:04.976
Dad!
Awesome, huh?

14:04.978 --> 14:07.879
Some weirdo called Sam F. who
had about a gazillion likes

14:07.881 --> 14:09.881
made it.
It was the perfect plan!

14:09.883 --> 14:12.217
Ugh, who cares?
You're safe!

14:12.219 --> 14:13.985
But hide that thing,
you doof.

14:13.987 --> 14:16.621
Come with us,
C.I.A. scum!

14:16.623 --> 14:18.056
(screams)

14:18.058 --> 14:19.724
Help!
Someone's kidnapped my dad!

14:19.726 --> 14:22.026
I'm on it.

14:26.066 --> 14:28.433
(cheers and applause)
Whoa. Cool.

14:33.006 --> 14:35.640
(Russian accent)
Deputy Director Bullock.

14:35.642 --> 14:39.177
You screw with my arms dealing
for the last time.

14:39.179 --> 14:41.045
Oh, this is great.
Heh!

14:41.047 --> 14:43.147
I was kind of freaking out with
the bag over my head

14:43.149 --> 14:44.482
and all the Russian talk.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.317
You know, which always sounds
angry.

14:46.319 --> 14:47.752
(making garbled noises)

14:47.754 --> 14:49.053
(chuckles)
But -- Whew! --

14:49.055 --> 14:50.321
you got the wrong guy.
Heh.

14:50.323 --> 14:52.056
You are Bullock.

14:52.058 --> 14:55.693
You win deejay battle every
night and run C.I.A. every day.

14:55.695 --> 14:58.096
You say so on Facebook page.

14:58.098 --> 14:59.898
That's not me. Tonight's
the first time

14:59.900 --> 15:02.734
I won the deejay thing.
I'm just a normal guy.

15:02.736 --> 15:04.569
Let me show you.
Mm...okay.

15:04.571 --> 15:08.006
But don't close that window.
I am picking movie seats.

15:08.008 --> 15:09.941
Look. I'm a piano tuner.

15:09.943 --> 15:11.242
My name's Jim Steele.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.610
Morons!

15:12.612 --> 15:14.579
I have no time for this!

15:14.581 --> 15:18.049
Is my daughter Tasha's birthday.
Sorry for inconvenience.

15:18.051 --> 15:19.617
I understand.
I have a daughter.

15:19.619 --> 15:21.185
Throw him from cliff.

15:21.187 --> 15:23.721
(screaming)

15:23.723 --> 15:26.291
(screaming continues)

15:27.761 --> 15:30.228
Oh, my God. For a second,
I thought that was me.

15:30.230 --> 15:31.963
(crying)

15:31.965 --> 15:34.465
The deejay
is ruining my party!

15:34.467 --> 15:36.467
Don't cry, cookie.

15:36.469 --> 15:38.636
Throw deejay from cliff
after this guy.

15:38.638 --> 15:42.540
Wait. I'm a great deejay.
I can save her party.

15:47.147 --> 15:51.115
Save Tasha's party and you can
forget about cliff.

15:51.117 --> 15:53.551
Forget about your beautiful
cliff?

15:53.553 --> 15:55.987
Not on your life.
It's majestic!

15:55.989 --> 15:57.588
You make joke.

15:57.590 --> 16:00.425
But two favorite things are
daughter and cliff.

16:00.427 --> 16:04.996
Oh! Who do you think is my
favorite character on "Cheers"?

16:04.998 --> 16:06.397
Cliff?

16:06.399 --> 16:08.433
No. Norm.

16:08.435 --> 16:11.936
He always have pleasure of
being with Cliff.

16:11.938 --> 16:14.339
(laughs)

16:14.341 --> 16:16.407
(laughter)

16:16.409 --> 16:18.076
(screaming)

16:18.078 --> 16:20.912
(thuds)
My memory stick!

16:20.914 --> 16:22.146
Is problem?

16:22.148 --> 16:23.815
Uh, no.
No, n-no problem.

16:23.817 --> 16:26.417
I just need
a new memory stick.

16:26.419 --> 16:28.286
They're only magnets.
Metal.

16:28.288 --> 16:30.688
Stuff you mine.
Like from this cliff!

16:30.690 --> 16:33.424
Careful, guy.
That is my cliff.

16:33.426 --> 16:35.159
(grunts)
(gasps)

16:35.161 --> 16:37.929
There's got to be
something here.

16:37.931 --> 16:41.499
Iron ore.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.334
Nickel-cadmium.

16:43.336 --> 16:47.138
The two main ingredients in
a thumb drive.

16:47.140 --> 16:50.675
Full of music.
(kisses)

16:50.677 --> 16:53.277
(dance music plays)

16:59.219 --> 17:02.620
(retching)

17:06.526 --> 17:08.226
Wha-- what's going on?

17:08.228 --> 17:10.728
How did I get back here?
You never left.

17:10.730 --> 17:13.031
You've been on a psychedelic
trip for 24 hours.

17:13.033 --> 17:16.067
But you were never alone.
I saw to that, bro.

17:16.069 --> 17:19.704
Dad, we only have 20 minutes to
get you to the deejay battle.

17:19.706 --> 17:22.306
So, I-I didn't beat Bullock?

17:22.308 --> 17:24.809
No, Stan. You were just humming
the "Cheers" theme song

17:24.811 --> 17:26.544
and shitting yourself.

17:28.014 --> 17:30.581
(tapping)
Testing, testing.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.650
Can't he just play it, Roger?

17:32.652 --> 17:34.652
It's my shift to watch
Stan again.

17:34.654 --> 17:36.220
Look, Stan's as good as dead.

17:36.222 --> 17:38.589
His heart stopped four times
last night, right?

17:38.591 --> 17:40.391
And he's leaving on a suicide
mission tomorrow.

17:40.393 --> 17:43.061
So please, let's focus on
what still matters.

17:43.063 --> 17:46.898
This is the first recording,
at least on Earth, of the turin.

17:46.900 --> 17:49.400
What -- what -- what's this
about a suicide mission?

17:49.402 --> 17:51.269
I thought Dad had
food poisoning.

17:51.271 --> 17:52.870
Look, everybody's gonna be
fine, all right?

17:52.872 --> 17:54.806
Let's just sit and enjoy
the music.

17:58.445 --> 18:01.112
No.
No, it's not the time.

18:01.114 --> 18:03.214
What?! Of course it's the time!
Play it!

18:03.216 --> 18:05.516
You can't just play the turin.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.685
It tells<i> you</i> when to play it.

18:07.687 --> 18:09.887
What in the ffff-- fine!

18:09.889 --> 18:12.123
And is it telling you
anything now?

18:12.125 --> 18:13.758
No.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.393
Is this bullshit, man?

18:15.395 --> 18:17.862
'Cause my best friend is dying
just down the hall.

18:17.864 --> 18:20.531
What is happening?!

18:20.533 --> 18:22.733
(tires screech, horns honk)

18:22.735 --> 18:25.236
It's amazing, but that tea
actually taught me

18:25.238 --> 18:27.205
how to improvise.
Not really.

18:27.207 --> 18:29.774
Taught you how to put someone
else's set on a memory stick.

18:29.776 --> 18:32.110
But if it beats Bullock
and keeps you alive,

18:32.112 --> 18:33.478
that's all that matters.

18:33.480 --> 18:34.912
Listen to you.

18:34.914 --> 18:37.048
Finally coming around
and seeing the value

18:37.050 --> 18:39.083
of a good,
well-thought-out --

18:39.085 --> 18:42.086
(horn blaring)

18:42.088 --> 18:43.321
(steam hissing)

18:43.323 --> 18:45.756
-No! Your music!
-Hayley?

18:45.758 --> 18:47.725
Smith, you idiot!

18:47.727 --> 18:48.993
I had the red.

18:48.995 --> 18:51.662
(tires squealing)

18:51.664 --> 18:53.564
I can't back up.
I'm stuck.

18:53.566 --> 18:56.234
I -- Euuuugh!

18:56.236 --> 18:59.003
HAYLEY: Go with the flow.
Go with the flow.

18:59.005 --> 19:00.471
Go with the flow.
Go with the flow.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.006
Go with the flow.

19:02.008 --> 19:04.175
Go with the flow.

19:04.177 --> 19:05.610
Dad, what the hell?!

19:05.612 --> 19:07.645
(metal screeching)

19:07.647 --> 19:10.348
I'm doing it, Hayley!
It feels amazing!

19:10.350 --> 19:12.683
What are you doing?!
I'm improvising!

19:12.685 --> 19:14.652
Our plan was to beat Bullock.

19:14.654 --> 19:17.421
But if we keep him from
competing, he'll still lose.

19:17.423 --> 19:20.191
Ooooh!
Ahhh!

19:20.193 --> 19:22.326
Oh, my God,
you're right.

19:22.328 --> 19:24.462
A-and you just came up
with that?

19:24.464 --> 19:26.531
Yes!
Like improv!

19:26.533 --> 19:29.033
Whose line is it, anyway?!

19:29.035 --> 19:31.702
BULLOCK: What a light show!

19:31.704 --> 19:33.671
Oh, Stan's
having an accident.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.139
Look at me go!

19:35.141 --> 19:36.607
Look at you go!

19:36.609 --> 19:38.309
That's living without a plan.

19:38.311 --> 19:41.479
It's so freeing -- I can see why
you want to live this way.

19:41.481 --> 19:44.182
I'm sorry I was trying to
change you, baby girl.

19:44.184 --> 19:46.951
(thudding)

19:46.953 --> 19:49.220
(grinding)

19:49.222 --> 19:51.222
You pushed him right to
the club!

19:51.224 --> 19:52.857
(struggles)
It's stuck!

19:52.859 --> 19:55.026
If he deejays,
I'm as good as dead.

19:55.028 --> 19:58.896
Thank God my pipe didn't break.

19:58.898 --> 20:02.133
(inhales)

20:02.135 --> 20:04.869
(tires screech)

20:04.871 --> 20:07.572
(roars)

20:07.574 --> 20:09.273
(gasps)
The dragon!

20:11.811 --> 20:13.077
Get up, you fool!

20:13.079 --> 20:14.812
But the turin's played
lying down.

20:14.814 --> 20:17.381
Of course it is.

20:17.383 --> 20:19.150
(beautiful music plays)

20:19.152 --> 20:20.918
That music.

20:20.920 --> 20:24.322
It's so soothing.

20:24.324 --> 20:28.092
(music continues)

20:31.764 --> 20:33.364
Oh, baby.

20:33.366 --> 20:35.099
You are a dragon soother.

20:35.101 --> 20:37.034
I was wrong
about you, Jeff.

20:37.036 --> 20:40.571
You're no bum.
You're a street musician.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.607
Entertainer of bums.

20:42.609 --> 20:46.277
(crying)

20:46.279 --> 20:48.079
Dad, go win this thing.

20:48.081 --> 20:50.715
But -- but I don't have to.

20:50.717 --> 20:53.351
And I don't want to.

20:53.353 --> 20:56.120
Well, that just leaves
one loose end.

20:56.122 --> 20:59.724
This is a turin, Wayne.

20:59.726 --> 21:02.193
(cymbals ring)

21:02.195 --> 21:04.795
Bye! Have a great time!
