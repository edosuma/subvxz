[MOCK COUGH] Told you! Ahem.

10:55.783 --> 10:57.983
The longbow hunters are a
direct connection to Diaz.

10:57.986 --> 11:00.382
They are the best lead
we've had on him in months.

11:00.385 --> 11:03.190
You know it, John. John,
I need to do something.

11:03.193 --> 11:06.136
I know, and I'm sorry, but
A.R.G.U.S. has its protocols.

11:06.139 --> 11:07.289
- John...
- We will keep you updated.

11:07.291 --> 11:10.325
Felicity, just trust me.

11:15.439 --> 11:16.771
Laurel...

11:16.773 --> 11:18.483
We need to talk.

11:18.486 --> 11:20.257
If this is about the Conway case,

11:20.260 --> 11:22.476
I already told Anastas I need more time.

That is not why I'm
here, and you know it.

Aw. Did you miss me? That's so sweet.

11:27.617 --> 11:32.350
Laurel, you ditched your
protective detail again.

11:32.353 --> 11:34.520
Perhaps you should get your
facts straight, Captain.

11:34.523 --> 11:37.458
Your officers had a medical emergency.

11:37.461 --> 11:39.257
Food poisoning, I think it was.

11:39.260 --> 11:42.382
Food poisoning does not
cause hearing loss or Vertigo.

Ooh, that sounds serious.

11:46.553 --> 11:48.541
This isn't a joke, Laurel.

11:48.544 --> 11:50.277
You know, I just heard from A.R.G.U.S.

care if Diaz kills you,

12:02.020 --> 12:04.084

Diaz kidnapped you.

12:06.806 --> 12:09.921
He killed Quentin, who everyone
believes is your father.

12:09.924 --> 12:11.186
Such a joke.

12:11.189 --> 12:12.780
Hey, I cared about him.

go get me a coffee.

You hired those prisoners
to attack me in the shower

13:27.471 --> 13:28.997
for Diaz.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.972
So why don't you tell
me how I can find him?

Okay. Now, we know they
have a super battery.

15:11.909 --> 15:13.872
Chances are they've tried
to test it. And doing that...

15:13.874 --> 15:15.364
Would require an
incredible amount of energy,

15:15.366 --> 15:17.078
which would, in turn,
create a power surge.

trace to a specific location.
