00:55.344 --> 00:56.551
Listen.

00:57.551 --> 00:59.586
It's a cow elk.

01:01.448 --> 01:02.655
- What's she doing?

01:05.827 --> 01:07.172
- She's a smart one.

01:10.241 --> 01:12.000
- I don't see her.

01:12.068 --> 01:14.620
- You won't.
You won't.

01:14.689 --> 01:17.965
She's leading that wolf
away from her baby.

01:18.034 --> 01:19.034
- Where's her baby?

01:20.551 --> 01:23.620
- Laying in some sagebrush
right in front of him.

01:25.034 --> 01:29.551
When elk are babies,
they don't have any scent.

01:29.620 --> 01:31.206
So the only way
the wolf can find it

01:31.275 --> 01:34.379
is if it loses faith
in its mama,

01:34.448 --> 01:35.586

01:38.413 --> 01:41.931
I'm feeling a little
sentimental, grandson.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.827
I'd like to see
that little elk live.

the scales in his favor?

Stay right behind me, okay?

01:57.655 --> 02:00.931
We get too close,
it'll make a run for its mama

02:01.000 --> 02:02.551
and then we've screwed
the whole deal.

02:07.344 --> 02:09.172
- How are we gonna help it?

02:09.241 --> 02:11.034
- We're gonna mark a little
territory, grandson.

02:12.379 --> 02:13.827
Get to it.

02:19.586 --> 02:22.000
- Everywhere you can.
Let her rip.

02:44.517 --> 02:46.413
- Irrigating.
He's fine.

02:50.655 --> 02:52.000
- Get back in here.

02:57.482 --> 02:59.827
- Yeah, well, that...

02:59.896 --> 03:02.344
that should fix
him for a while.

03:03.931 --> 03:05.689
- What should we do now?

03:05.758 --> 03:07.517
- Well, I guess...

03:07.586 --> 03:09.482
Guess we should
check on the cattle.

03:12.482 --> 03:14.379
Cattle look good.

03:14.448 --> 03:16.413
- We done checking
on the cattle?

03:16.482 --> 03:18.206
- Yep.

03:18.275 --> 03:19.689
- What now?

03:21.379 --> 03:23.034
- Now we can do whatever
you want.

03:25.172 --> 03:26.482
- I don't know what I want.

03:28.620 --> 03:30.413
Let's go on a walk.

03:31.862 --> 03:33.172
- That's a great idea.

03:36.655 --> 03:39.275
- Thought ranching
would be tougher.

03:39.344 --> 03:40.862
- This isn't ranching, grandson.

03:40.931 --> 03:43.000
This is the spoils of it.

03:44.896 --> 03:46.655
- What's that mean?

03:46.724 --> 03:49.896
- It means this is
the reason we do it.

03:51.206 --> 03:53.620
Ranching's a...

03:53.689 --> 03:56.551
Ranching's a terrible
business, grandson.

03:56.620 --> 03:57.793
- Terrible?
How?

04:00.034 --> 04:01.310
- Well, where do I start...

04:03.000 --> 04:04.965
We can't control
the price of beef,

04:05.034 --> 04:07.517
or hay,
or the diesel it takes

04:07.586 --> 04:10.862
to take the cattle to auction,
or the hay out to the cattle.

04:10.931 --> 04:13.448
There's, uh, federal regulations

04:13.517 --> 04:16.172
and state regulations

04:16.241 --> 04:18.448
and county regulations

04:18.517 --> 04:23.137

in the city suing us,

04:23.206 --> 04:27.310

we raise the food they eat.

04:31.689 --> 04:33.310
What else?

04:33.379 --> 04:35.862
Then there's blizzards
and droughts

04:35.931 --> 04:38.137
and half the herd is trying
to kill itself in the river

04:38.206 --> 04:40.241
and the other half looking
for a hole in the fence

04:40.310 --> 04:43.517

middle of the highway

04:45.689 --> 04:47.551
Or wander into the forest

how come we do it?

- I need to appoint an interim
and host a special election.

- I have. Yes.

09:00.620 --> 09:02.517
- This the airport?
- Mm-hmm.

09:04.517 --> 09:09.068
- What investment are you
requesting from the state?

09:10.655 --> 09:12.206
- We want the land.

09:12.275 --> 09:15.206
You retain ownership, we
operate on a 30-year lease.

09:15.275 --> 09:17.310
The airlines are
assuming construction costs

09:17.379 --> 09:19.655
on their respective terminals,

09:19.724 --> 09:21.068
we'll build
the infrastructure,

09:21.137 --> 09:23.689
contract management
and operations back to the state

09:23.758 --> 09:25.206
for obvious reasons.

09:25.275 --> 09:28.000
Our build costs are
just over a billion.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.275
Now, we're looking for
400 million in land

09:30.344 --> 09:33.379
and a tax subsidy
of 500 million over ten years.

09:33.448 --> 09:35.068
- Talk to me about numbers.

09:35.137 --> 09:37.827
- The park has roughly
4 million visitors a year,

09:37.896 --> 09:40.551
the majority flying or
driving through Jackson Hole.

09:40.620 --> 09:43.931
Now, Cody, Wyoming sees
the most automobile traffic.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.344
We feel once ski resorts
are operational,

09:47.413 --> 09:50.034
the airport could see
2 million guests a year.

09:50.103 --> 09:54.068
- Has the forest service agreed
to the lease for the resort?

09:54.137 --> 09:55.482
- They have.

09:55.551 --> 09:58.689
12,000 acres will be
developed in three phases.

09:58.758 --> 10:01.275
The first resort will
be open in eighteen months

10:01.344 --> 10:05.517
with roughly 2000 beds available
through our three resorts.

10:05.586 --> 10:06.724
Ancillary building:

10:06.793 --> 10:09.310
condos, hotels not under
our umbrella,

10:09.379 --> 10:12.448
those things lag by another
18 months to two years.

10:12.517 --> 10:14.586
- Well, here's my concern:

10:14.655 --> 10:16.206
uh, I don't really look
at Jackson Hole

10:16.275 --> 10:19.206
as a model for
responsible development.

10:19.275 --> 10:21.241
You have multimillion dollar
second homes

10:21.310 --> 10:24.137
that are pricing the locals
from living there.

10:24.206 --> 10:26.000
Jackson has multiple
bedroom communities

10:26.068 --> 10:28.551
to absorb the displaced.

10:28.620 --> 10:30.000
Paradise Valley
doesn't have that.

10:32.206 --> 10:34.931
- Livingston is ripe for growth.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.241
Our urban planners feel the town
could absorb 40,000 people

10:38.310 --> 10:41.827
in the next decade,
and it needs to:

10:41.896 --> 10:44.517
Multimillion dollar second homes
paying property taxes

10:44.586 --> 10:47.241
into the community without
drawing on its services

10:47.310 --> 10:50.172
is exactly what
this valley needs.

10:50.241 --> 10:52.413
And we're talking about
between 3 and 6 billion

10:52.482 --> 10:55.275
in annual tax revenue
generated by these developments.

10:59.310 --> 11:01.275
- Have you chosen
a location for the airport?

11:01.344 --> 11:03.344
- Initially, we thought
the golf courses

11:03.413 --> 11:06.206
at the Paradise Valley sporting
club could be repurposed,

11:06.275 --> 11:10.689
but the FAA feels the valley
there is too narrow.

11:10.758 --> 11:12.379
The FAA chose this location.

- That's a
seven-generation ranch.

11:27.896 --> 11:28.965
He'll never sell.

11:29.034 --> 11:31.758
- Then you'll invoke
eminent domain.

11:31.827 --> 11:33.206
- It's been attempted.

11:33.275 --> 11:35.379
He beat it.

11:35.448 --> 11:38.896
- Mm-hmm, for a three-hundred
unit condo complex.

11:38.965 --> 11:41.793
That was a land grab.

11:41.862 --> 11:44.068
Did seven generations
of ranchers infuse

11:44.137 --> 11:46.000
6 billion dollars
into the economy?

11:50.551 --> 11:52.241
That's progress, Governor.

11:52.310 --> 11:53.827
And progress has a price.

well spent.

12:16.862 --> 12:17.793

12:19.379 --> 12:21.206
- So they say.

- Do you know where?

12:23.896 --> 12:25.275
- The Sporting Club.

12:25.344 --> 12:27.793
- Not the Sporting Club.
Not anymore.

- Turn that off.

And now--

13:16.517 --> 13:18.034
- Shut the fuck up!

13:19.482 --> 13:21.344
Now, you need to tell me
exactly what happened

13:21.413 --> 13:23.551

13:23.620 --> 13:26.103

she was all just

13:29.620 --> 13:33.448
And the deputies,
they took these two old boys

13:33.517 --> 13:35.068
and they put him
in a horse stall.

13:35.137 --> 13:36.620
- In a horse stall.

13:36.689 --> 13:37.827
Not the squad vehicle?

13:37.896 --> 13:38.896
- In a horse stall.

13:40.379 --> 13:42.241
And told me to send
a message with 'em.

And so we threw 'em in the back
of the victim's horse trailer.

And I just drove them around.

13:50.034 --> 13:54.310

the brakes pretty hard.

in the trailer?

- Um, the deputies did.

14:01.137 --> 14:02.448
- Mm-hmm.

14:02.517 --> 14:05.206
Is there a chance
that they were assaulted

14:06.482 --> 14:07.862
- No, I didn't see--

14:12.655 --> 14:15.000
- Sure.
Yeah, there's a chance.

14:17.724 --> 14:21.379
- Yeah. All right.

14:21.448 --> 14:22.965
You loaded them in the trailer

14:23.034 --> 14:26.344
because your vehicle cannot
accommodate two perpetrators.

14:26.413 --> 14:31.482
They had indicated to you that
there were other horses stolen.

of the stolen horses.
