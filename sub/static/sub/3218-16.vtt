00:20.972 --> 00:24.139
- You're offering your own soul?
- All you gotta do is bring Sam back.

00:24.309 --> 00:26.100
- How long did you get?
- One year.

00:26.393 --> 00:29.430
- Let Dean out of his deal now.
- I got a boss like everybody.

00:29.606 --> 00:32.061
- Who holds the contract?
- I can't tell you.

00:33.903 --> 00:35.562
There's a new leader rising in the West.

00:35.737 --> 00:37.315
He doesn't like you very much.

00:37.489 --> 00:39.482
Her name is Lilith.

00:39.658 --> 00:41.450
- I know about your deal.
- Who told you?

00:41.619 --> 00:44.289
The demon that holds it.
She holds mine too.

00:44.455 --> 00:46.993
- She?
- Her name's Lilith.

00:49.627 --> 00:51.667
So this is Ruby, huh?
She's a demon, Sam.

00:51.838 --> 00:53.498
They want us dead, we want them dead.

00:53.672 --> 00:55.132
What blade could kill a demon?

00:55.300 --> 00:56.925
Yesterday, there was no such thing.

00:57.093 --> 00:59.501
Yellow Eyes had some pretty big plans
for you, Sam.

00:59.679 --> 01:02.171
That you're special,
in that ESP vision kind of way.

01:02.350 --> 01:04.257
No, that stuff's not happening anymore.

01:04.434 --> 01:07.435
Black Dogs. They're seeing Hellhounds.
Demonic pit bulls.

01:12.527 --> 01:15.148
- There's no way to save me from the pit?
- No.

01:16.031 --> 01:17.821
I don't wanna die.
I don't wanna go to hell.

01:17.990 --> 01:19.154
We'll find a way to save you.

01:34.716 --> 01:37.635
You're gonna die.
This is what you're gonna become.

02:40.371 --> 02:42.448
Dig up anything good?

02:43.499 --> 02:45.623
No, ahem, nothing good.

02:45.794 --> 02:47.666
Well, Bobby has, finally.

02:47.836 --> 02:50.210
- Yeah?
- Yeah, a way to find Lilith.

02:51.466 --> 02:55.084
Wow, and with just, uh, 30 hours to go.

02:56.763 --> 02:58.921
Hey, why don't we just make
a TJ run, you know?

02:59.099 --> 03:02.718
<i>You know, some se√±oritas, cervezas.
Uh, we could...</i>

03:02.895 --> 03:04.224
What's Spanish for "donkey show"?

03:06.232 --> 03:08.723
So if we do save you...

03:08.901 --> 03:11.902
...let's never do that.
- Yeah.

03:13.615 --> 03:16.700
Hey, hey, Dean, um...

03:19.787 --> 03:22.244
Look, we're cutting it close, I know.

03:23.375 --> 03:25.498
But we're gonna get this done.

03:26.295 --> 03:28.621
I don't care what it takes, Dean.

03:29.172 --> 03:31.380
You're not gonna go to hell.

03:32.343 --> 03:34.336
I'm not gonna let you.

03:36.598 --> 03:38.222
I swear.

03:38.892 --> 03:40.932
Everything's gonna be okay.

03:51.780 --> 03:53.524
Yeah, okay.

04:06.588 --> 04:10.206
See, a name.
That's the whole kit and caboodle.

04:10.383 --> 04:14.216
With the right name, the right ritual,
ain't nothing you can't suss out.

04:14.387 --> 04:16.677
Like the town Lilith's in?

04:16.891 --> 04:19.726
Kid, when I get done,
we'll know the street.

04:37.204 --> 04:38.746
New Harmony, Indiana.

04:39.289 --> 04:41.827
- And we have a winner.
All right.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.002
- Let's go.
- Whoa, hold on. Holster it up there, Tex.

04:45.171 --> 04:47.080
- What's the problem?
- "What's the problem"?

04:47.257 --> 04:48.336
Where do I begin?

04:48.508 --> 04:50.916
We don't even know
if Lilith actually holds my deal.

04:51.094 --> 04:53.252
We're going off of Bela's intel.

04:53.430 --> 04:56.099
When that bitch breathes,
the air comes out crooked, okay?

04:56.266 --> 04:59.102
Second, even if we get to Lilith,
we have no way to gank her.

04:59.270 --> 05:03.102
Third, isn't this the same Lilith that
wants your head? Should I continue?

05:03.274 --> 05:05.599
- Ha. Ain't you bringing down the room?
- It's a gift.

05:05.776 --> 05:07.521
I'm sorry, what are we supposed to do?

05:07.696 --> 05:11.029
I gotta die. Doesn't mean you have to.
We go in smart or we don't go in.

05:11.199 --> 05:13.654
- Lf that's the case, I have the answer.
- You do?

05:13.826 --> 05:15.985
Yeah, a sure-fire way
to confirm it's Lilith.

05:16.163 --> 05:19.080
And a way to get us a bona fide,
demon-killing Ginsu.

05:19.249 --> 05:21.207
Damn it, Sam, no.

05:21.377 --> 05:24.247
We are so past arguing.
Dean, I am summoning Ruby.

05:24.421 --> 05:26.213
The hell you are,
we've enough problems.

05:26.382 --> 05:27.496
Exactly.

05:27.674 --> 05:29.798
And we got no time
and no choice either.

05:29.969 --> 05:32.804
Come on, man, she is the Miss Universe
of lying skanks, okay?

05:32.972 --> 05:35.262
She told you
that she could save me, huh? Lie.

05:35.434 --> 05:37.307
She seems to know
everything about Lilith...

05:37.477 --> 05:39.351
...but forgot to mention
Lilith owns my soul.

05:39.521 --> 05:41.478
Okay, she's a liar.
She's still got that knife.

05:41.647 --> 05:42.977
- Dean...
- She works for Lilith.

05:43.150 --> 05:44.977
Give me another option, tell me.

05:45.152 --> 05:47.109
- Sam's right.
- No, damn it.

05:52.368 --> 05:54.077
Just no.

05:55.329 --> 05:57.951
We are not gonna make
the same mistakes all over again.

06:01.294 --> 06:03.832
You guys wanna save me?
Find something else.

06:14.809 --> 06:16.684
Where're you going, Bobby?

06:16.854 --> 06:21.978
I guess to find something else.

07:23.841 --> 07:26.048
You know, phones work too.

07:27.011 --> 07:29.336
Hey, Sam. How's tricks?

07:29.515 --> 07:33.464
- How do you get around so fast?
- I got the Super Bowl jetpack.

07:34.728 --> 07:36.221
So...

07:37.106 --> 07:38.268
...you called?

07:38.440 --> 07:39.934
Did you know?

07:40.109 --> 07:43.692
- Um, gonna need a tiny bit more.
- About Dean's deal.

07:43.863 --> 07:47.446
- That Lilith holds the contract.
- Yes, I did.

07:49.785 --> 07:52.359
And what?
You didn't think that was important?

07:52.539 --> 07:53.867
- You weren't ready.
- For what?

07:54.040 --> 07:58.749
If I told you, you two yahoos would have
just charged after her halfcocked.

07:58.920 --> 08:02.124
And Lilith would have peeled the meat
from your pretty, pretty faces.

08:02.924 --> 08:04.206
Well, we're ready now.

08:05.803 --> 08:07.130
I want your knife.

08:09.598 --> 08:12.006
You're right about one thing.

08:12.685 --> 08:14.643
If you are ready...

08:15.188 --> 08:17.394
And now's the time too.

08:17.648 --> 08:19.523
Lilith's guard's down.

08:19.693 --> 08:21.436
Is that so?

08:21.945 --> 08:24.732
She's on shore leave. A little R and R.

08:24.907 --> 08:28.276
- What the hell does that mean?
- Trust me, you don't wanna know.

08:28.703 --> 08:30.860
You didn't lose those hex bags
I gave you?

08:31.038 --> 08:32.153
We got them.

08:32.332 --> 08:35.082
Good, then she won't sense
that you're coming.

08:36.126 --> 08:38.499
- So you'll give us the knife?
- No.

08:40.173 --> 08:42.000
- You just said...
- You wanna charge in...

08:42.176 --> 08:43.966
...with one little pig-sticker?

08:44.135 --> 08:45.761
It's a waste of a true-blue window.

08:45.930 --> 08:48.502
Like hitting Hitler
with that exploding briefcase. Forget it.

08:48.681 --> 08:49.845
Okay, then how?

08:53.103 --> 08:55.429
- I know how to save your brother.
- No, you don't.

08:55.606 --> 08:58.476
You told Dean you couldn't.
You've been lying to me all along.

08:58.651 --> 09:01.606
- So just give me your knife.
- You're not the one I've been lying to.

09:01.779 --> 09:03.653
- Oh, so you could save him?
- No.

09:04.783 --> 09:06.324
But you can.

09:07.619 --> 09:12.696
- What?
- Sam, you've got some God-given talent.

09:12.874 --> 09:16.041
Well, not God-given,
but you get the gist.

09:16.211 --> 09:17.540
All that psychic crap?

09:18.923 --> 09:20.714
That's gone ever since Yellow Eyes died.

09:21.217 --> 09:24.503
Not gone. Dormant.

09:24.679 --> 09:26.221
And not just visions either.

09:27.056 --> 09:29.547
Why do you think
Lilith is so scared of you?

09:29.725 --> 09:31.304
Right, she's scared of me.

09:31.478 --> 09:34.313
If you wanted, you could wipe her
off the map without moving a muscle.

09:34.481 --> 09:36.225
- I don't believe you.
- It's the truth.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.273
And you decided to tell me this
just now?

09:38.443 --> 09:40.602
Um, demon?

09:40.779 --> 09:42.902
Manipulative's kind of
in the job description.

09:44.450 --> 09:46.858
Fact is, is that you never
would have considered it.

09:47.036 --> 09:49.574
- Not until you were...
- Desperate enough?

09:52.167 --> 09:54.076
You don't like being different.

09:55.045 --> 09:57.084
You hate the way
Dean looks at you sometimes.

09:57.589 --> 09:59.748
Like you're some sort of sideshow freak.

10:00.926 --> 10:03.678
But suck it up, because we got
a lot of ground to cover...

10:03.846 --> 10:06.088
...and we gotta do it fast,
but we can do it.

10:08.684 --> 10:10.760
Look, call me a bitch,
hate me all you want...

10:10.936 --> 10:13.772
...but I have never lied to you, Sam.

10:13.940 --> 10:15.220
Not ever.

10:15.776 --> 10:21.018
And I'm telling you,
you can save your brother.

10:21.198 --> 10:22.776
And I can show you how.

10:22.950 --> 10:26.070
So that's you, huh?
Our slutty little Yoda.

10:26.996 --> 10:28.371
Dean.

10:30.291 --> 10:33.577
- Charming as ever.
- Oh, I knew you'd show up.

10:33.753 --> 10:35.876
Because I knew Sam wouldn't listen.

10:36.673 --> 10:40.623
But you're not gonna teach him anything.
You understand me? Over my dead body.

10:40.803 --> 10:42.628
Oh, well, you're right about that.

10:43.179 --> 10:45.422
What you are gonna do
is give me that knife.

10:45.599 --> 10:48.635
And then you'll go crawl back
into whatever slop you came from...

10:48.811 --> 10:50.721
...and never bother me again,
are we clear?

10:50.897 --> 10:52.972
Your brother is carrying
a bomb inside of him...

10:53.148 --> 10:54.727
...and we'd be stupid not to use it.

10:54.901 --> 10:56.774
- Dean, look, just hold on...
- Sam, don't.

10:56.944 --> 10:59.815
- You blind? Can't you see this is a trick?
- That's not true.

10:59.989 --> 11:03.358
She wants you to give in to this whole
demonic, psychic whatever, okay?

11:03.535 --> 11:06.156
She wants you to become
her little Antichrist superstar.

11:06.329 --> 11:09.615
I want Lilith dead. That's all.

11:09.791 --> 11:11.072
- Why?
- I've told you why.

11:11.252 --> 11:13.541
Oh, right, yeah.
Because you were human once.

11:13.713 --> 11:16.120
And you like kittens
and long walks on the beach.

11:16.298 --> 11:19.050
You know, I am so sick
of proving myself to you.

11:19.218 --> 11:22.920
You wanna save yourself?
This is how, you dumb, spineless dick.

11:32.858 --> 11:34.649
Ruby, hey. Oh! Unh!

11:54.506 --> 11:56.665
What the hell are you grinning at?

11:58.218 --> 11:59.713
Missing something?

12:01.388 --> 12:04.059
I'll kill you, you son of a bitch.

12:14.945 --> 12:18.989
Like I said, I knew you'd come.

12:20.576 --> 12:23.410
Wait, you're just gonna leave me here?

12:23.578 --> 12:25.488
Let's go, Sam.

12:25.915 --> 12:29.200
Oh. Oh, so you're
just too stupid to live, is that it?

12:29.377 --> 12:31.950
Then fine. You deserve hell.

12:32.129 --> 12:33.754
And I wish I could be there, Dean.

12:33.923 --> 12:37.292
I wish I could smell the flesh
sizzle off your bones.

12:37.468 --> 12:39.628
I wish I could be there
to hear you scream!

12:39.805 --> 12:43.553
And I wish you'd shut your pie hole,
but we don't always get what we want.

13:05.039 --> 13:06.867
We're just gonna let
Ruby rot down there?

13:07.042 --> 13:08.749
That's the idea.

13:09.128 --> 13:11.880
Dean, what if, um...?

13:13.382 --> 13:17.001
What if Ruby's right?
What if I can take out Lilith?

13:21.057 --> 13:24.592
- Quit looking at me like that.
- Give her the stare and Lilith goes poof?

13:24.770 --> 13:28.185
I don't know what Ruby meant.
Maybe we should just go ask her.

13:28.523 --> 13:30.398
You wanted the knife,
I got you the knife.

13:30.568 --> 13:31.765
Listen to me for a second.

13:31.943 --> 13:35.562
Last time, Lilith snapped her fingers
and put 30 demons on our ass.

13:35.739 --> 13:37.234
All we got is one little knife?

13:37.408 --> 13:40.279
- We go in smart or we don't go in at all.
- This ain't smart.

13:40.453 --> 13:42.695
We got one shot at this, Dean. Just one.

13:42.872 --> 13:46.158
So if there's a sure-fire way,
then maybe we should just talk about it.

13:46.334 --> 13:49.999
Sam, we are not gonna make
the same mistake all over again.

13:50.171 --> 13:51.797
You said that, but what does that mean?

13:51.965 --> 13:53.246
Don't you see a pattern?

13:53.425 --> 13:56.177
Dad's deal, my deal, now this.

13:56.345 --> 14:00.010
Every time one of us is up the creek,
the other's begging to sell their soul.

14:00.182 --> 14:01.725
That's all this is, man.

14:01.893 --> 14:04.680
Ruby's just jerking your chain
down the road.

14:04.854 --> 14:08.104
You know what it's paved with,
and you know where it's going.

14:09.734 --> 14:11.313
Dean.

14:15.074 --> 14:17.564
What are you afraid is gonna happen?

14:18.202 --> 14:19.696
This is me, I can handle it.

14:20.579 --> 14:23.117
- And if it'll save you...
- Why even risk it?

14:24.834 --> 14:26.292
Because you're my brother.

14:28.379 --> 14:30.040
Because you did the same thing for me.

14:31.757 --> 14:33.336
I know.

14:34.136 --> 14:36.294
And look how that turned out.

14:38.640 --> 14:40.300
All I'm saying...

14:43.313 --> 14:46.148
Sammy, all I'm saying
is that you're my weak spot.

14:46.858 --> 14:50.476
You are. And I'm yours.

14:52.781 --> 14:55.402
No, you don't mean that. We're family.

14:55.575 --> 14:58.944
I know. And those evil sons of bitches
know it too.

15:01.081 --> 15:04.082
I mean, what we'll do for each other,
you know, how far we'll go.

15:04.251 --> 15:05.414
They're using it against us.

15:05.586 --> 15:07.495
So we just stop
looking out for each other?

15:07.671 --> 15:09.498
No, we stop being martyrs.

15:09.673 --> 15:12.627
Man, we stop spreading it
for these demons.

15:14.095 --> 15:17.346
We take this knife
and we go after Lilith our way.

15:17.516 --> 15:19.473
The way Dad taught us to.

15:21.895 --> 15:24.054
And if we go down, then, uh...

15:25.190 --> 15:26.933
...then we go down swinging.

15:30.153 --> 15:31.185
What do you think?

15:36.744 --> 15:39.317
I think you should have been jamming
"Eye of the Tiger. "

15:39.497 --> 15:41.372
Oh, bite me.

15:41.708 --> 15:43.499
You know,
I totally rehearsed that speech too.

15:46.880 --> 15:50.166
- So, Indiana, huh?
- Yeah, where Lilith is on shore leave.

15:50.342 --> 15:52.336
Yeah, I guess.

15:53.804 --> 15:55.679
Tell me something.

15:55.849 --> 15:58.385
What the hell does a demon do for fun?

16:11.906 --> 16:13.022
- Hey, Pat.
- Tom.

16:13.200 --> 16:16.569
- How's that granddaughter of yours?
- Home sick, poor thing.

16:16.746 --> 16:19.664
- Darn bug that's going around now.
- Oh, that's too bad.

16:19.832 --> 16:21.908
You give her a big old hug
from me and Judy.

16:22.084 --> 16:25.833
- You bet. Take her easy, Tom.
- You too, Pat.

16:44.609 --> 16:45.771
Where is she?

16:45.943 --> 16:51.021
- Upstairs, playing with Freckles.
- Lf we just sit here, we're dead.

16:51.200 --> 16:52.776
- She'll hear you.
It's her or us.

16:52.950 --> 16:55.110
- It's my baby girl.
- Not anymore.

16:56.913 --> 16:58.741
There's something inside her.

16:58.916 --> 17:00.540
Shut your mouth. She's coming.

17:02.461 --> 17:05.960
- What were you guys talking about?
- Just how much we love you.

17:06.131 --> 17:09.797
- What happened to your dress?
- Oh, Freckles was mean to me.

17:12.555 --> 17:14.594
That's... That's nice, dear.

17:15.809 --> 17:17.885
Daddy, will you push me on the swing?

17:19.104 --> 17:21.476
Well, sure, honey.

17:22.525 --> 17:24.066
But don't you wanna change first?

17:25.403 --> 17:29.447
I mean, you don't want the neighbors
to see all that blood.

17:29.615 --> 17:32.487
Oh, you're so smart. I love you, Daddy.

17:34.620 --> 17:35.652
I love you too.

17:37.832 --> 17:41.416
Hey, sweetie,
you think maybe after a while...

17:42.671 --> 17:44.545
...do you think maybe you could...

17:46.883 --> 17:48.461
...let us go?

17:51.930 --> 17:54.469
- Why?
- I, uh...

17:56.936 --> 17:59.178
- Well, I don't know.
- Don't you wanna be here?

18:01.608 --> 18:02.853
Don't you love me?

18:03.944 --> 18:06.185
- Well, sure, I do.
- Oh, we all do, honey.

18:06.362 --> 18:09.280
- We all love you so much.
Don't be mean to me, Daddy.

18:09.449 --> 18:12.367
Like Freckles or what's-her-name,
that mean old babysitter.

18:16.582 --> 18:17.781
L... I'm sorry.

18:21.963 --> 18:24.715
That's okay, silly. Now let's go and play.

18:34.142 --> 18:36.052
Where do you think you're going?

18:45.030 --> 18:46.986
We got the knife.

18:47.406 --> 18:49.151
And you intend to use it without me.

18:49.326 --> 18:51.817
Do I look like
a ditch-able prom date to you?

18:52.454 --> 18:56.404
- No, Bobby, of course not.
- This is about me and Sam.

18:56.583 --> 18:58.873
- Okay, this isn't your fight.
- The hell it isn't.

18:59.795 --> 19:02.713
Family don't end with blood, boy.

19:06.886 --> 19:09.424
Besides, you need me.

19:09.764 --> 19:11.840
- Bobby...
- You're playing wounded.

19:12.434 --> 19:15.600
Tell me, how many hallucinations
have you had so far?

19:20.276 --> 19:22.019
- How'd you know?
- That's what happens...

19:22.194 --> 19:24.270
...when you got Hellhounds on your butt.

19:24.447 --> 19:26.524
And because I'm smart.

19:33.038 --> 19:34.285
I'll follow.

19:38.962 --> 19:41.453
Don't be stopping to pee
every 10 minutes either.

19:50.808 --> 19:52.433
Hey, Dean?

19:52.602 --> 19:54.097
Yeah?

19:56.022 --> 19:57.433
You know, if this doesn't, uh...

19:58.609 --> 20:00.268
If this doesn't go the way we want...

20:00.443 --> 20:02.484
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- "No" what?

20:02.655 --> 20:06.818
You're not gonna bust out
the misty goodbye speech, okay?

20:06.992 --> 20:11.322
And if this is my last day on earth,
I do not want it to be socially awkward.

20:15.794 --> 20:17.453
You know what I do want?

20:22.509 --> 20:26.257
- Bon Jovi?
- Bon Jovi rocks on occasion.

20:36.232 --> 20:37.394
Come on.

21:38.800 --> 21:40.791
We getting pulled over?

21:41.761 --> 21:44.132
I got a busted taillight.

21:44.721 --> 21:47.178
It's not like we're in a hurry or nothing.

21:59.071 --> 22:02.071
- Problem, officer?
- License and registration, please.

22:02.241 --> 22:06.074
Do you realize you have a taillight out,
Mr. Hagar?

22:08.288 --> 22:09.949
Yes. Yes, sir.

22:10.125 --> 22:13.743
Uh, you know,
I've been meaning to take care of that.

22:14.212 --> 22:15.457
As a matter of fact...

22:17.257 --> 22:18.288
Hey!

22:31.480 --> 22:33.807
- What the hell happened?
- Dean just killed a demon.

22:34.775 --> 22:36.602
How'd you know?

22:37.320 --> 22:39.146
I just knew.

22:39.488 --> 22:41.067
I could see its face.

22:41.241 --> 22:43.612
Its real face under that one.

22:56.466 --> 22:58.090
So, what? Now you're seeing demons?

22:58.259 --> 23:02.043
I've been seeing all kinds of things lately,
but nothing like this.

23:02.221 --> 23:05.058
- Actually, it's not all that crazy.
- How's it not that crazy?

23:05.225 --> 23:07.715
What you got?
Just over five hours to go?

23:07.894 --> 23:09.555
You're piercing the veil, Dean.

23:09.730 --> 23:11.853
You're glimpsing the B-side.

23:13.734 --> 23:16.307
- Little less New Age-y, please.
- You're almost hell's bitch.

23:17.071 --> 23:19.230
So you can see hell's other bitches.

23:19.407 --> 23:20.569
Thank you.

23:20.741 --> 23:22.201
It'll actually come in handy.

23:22.369 --> 23:24.111
Glad my doomed soul's
good for something.

23:24.286 --> 23:25.485
Damn right it is.

23:25.664 --> 23:28.071
Lilith's probably got demons
stashed all over town.

23:28.249 --> 23:32.081
We can't let them sound the alarm.
If she knows we're here, we're dead.

23:32.253 --> 23:33.748
Well, this is a terrific plan.

23:33.922 --> 23:37.256
I'm excited to be a part of it.
Can we go, please?

23:45.935 --> 23:47.844
Happy birthday, sweetie.

23:48.020 --> 23:49.479
Happy birthday.

23:49.648 --> 23:52.601
Yay, it's my birthday every day.

23:58.740 --> 24:01.029
Mm. Cake.

24:01.201 --> 24:02.612
Again.

24:02.786 --> 24:04.365
It's good.

24:04.789 --> 24:06.662
Hey, Grandpa, can I ask you something?

24:06.832 --> 24:08.327
Sure, jellybean, anything.

24:08.501 --> 24:10.624
Why'd you try to go to Mr. Weprin
for help?

24:12.714 --> 24:14.338
Well, I didn't.

24:14.507 --> 24:16.963
- I don't know what you mean.
- You're a big fat liar.

24:17.135 --> 24:18.416
I'm sorry.

24:19.012 --> 24:20.126
It was a mistake.

24:20.305 --> 24:22.631
Did you two know about this?

24:27.563 --> 24:29.105
No.

24:32.402 --> 24:33.812
No.

24:36.907 --> 24:39.694
- Grandpa, you don't love me?
- I do.

24:39.868 --> 24:42.655
- I do. I love you.
No, you don't.

24:42.829 --> 24:44.454
You're lying again.

24:44.623 --> 24:45.952
You're just a mean old man.

24:46.917 --> 24:47.948
Do something.

24:49.587 --> 24:50.831
Help me, please.

24:51.004 --> 24:53.461
I don't think I like you anymore.

24:56.302 --> 24:57.880
Nobody scream, okay?

24:58.054 --> 24:59.963
Screaming makes me mad.

25:09.148 --> 25:11.142
Mommy, can I have
ice cream with mine?

25:16.199 --> 25:17.527
It's the little girl.

25:18.034 --> 25:20.572
Oh, God, her face is awful.

25:20.745 --> 25:22.820
All right, then let's go.
We're wasting time.

25:22.996 --> 25:24.029
Wait.

25:24.207 --> 25:26.164
For what?
For her to kill the rest of them?

25:26.334 --> 25:29.454
Yeah, and us too, if we're not careful.
Look.

25:29.629 --> 25:33.164
See the real go-getter mailman
on the clock at 9 p. M?

25:33.341 --> 25:35.750
And Mr. Rogers over there.

25:35.928 --> 25:38.004
- Demons?
Yes.

25:38.180 --> 25:40.967
Okay, fine. We...
We ninja past those guys, sneak in.

25:41.142 --> 25:44.227
- Then give a Colombian necktie to a girl?
- I know it's awful.

25:44.396 --> 25:47.064
- You think?
- This isn't just about saving you, Dean.

25:47.231 --> 25:48.691
This is about saving everybody.

25:50.067 --> 25:52.393
She's gotta be stopped, son.

25:55.949 --> 25:57.360
Oh, damn it.

25:57.534 --> 26:02.280
Read it again, Mommy.
- But I've read it 26 times.

26:02.457 --> 26:03.702
Again.

26:06.586 --> 26:11.248
"Once upon a time,
in the town of Selene...

26:11.549 --> 26:13.755
...lived a beautiful princess named Cleo.

26:14.677 --> 26:18.046
But the town was plagued
with an evil dragon...

26:18.473 --> 26:21.391
...that demanded
the blood of the children.

26:21.560 --> 26:23.767
And the princess was doomed
to be sacrificed...

26:23.938 --> 26:26.346
...to the dark and terrible dragon. "

26:26.524 --> 26:27.555
Hmm.

27:34.680 --> 27:36.589
I'd like my knife back, please.

27:36.765 --> 27:38.676
Or your neck snaps like a chicken bone.

27:38.852 --> 27:41.520
He doesn't have it. Take it easy.

27:43.231 --> 27:45.224
How the hell did you get out?

27:45.400 --> 27:47.856
What you don't know about me
could fill a book.

27:48.028 --> 27:49.190
Oh.

27:49.362 --> 27:50.773
What?

27:52.241 --> 27:53.272
Nothing. I just...

27:53.450 --> 27:57.151
I couldn't see it before,
but you are one ugly broad.

27:57.538 --> 28:00.160
Sam, give me the knife
before you hurt yourself.

28:01.084 --> 28:04.417
- You'll get it when this is over.
- It's already over.

28:04.587 --> 28:08.371
I gave you a way to save Dean,
you shot me down. Now it's too late.

28:08.549 --> 28:11.385
He's dead.
And I'm not gonna let you die too.

28:11.552 --> 28:13.012
Try and stop me and I'll kill you...

28:14.723 --> 28:16.550
...bitch.
- Hit me with your best shot, baby.

28:16.725 --> 28:18.718
Guys, guys. Hey.

28:19.520 --> 28:21.726
Have your little catfight later.

28:27.070 --> 28:31.732
- So much for the element of surprise.
- Go. Run, run, run.

28:35.704 --> 28:37.828
Okay, okay.

28:38.457 --> 28:40.496
What the hell's taking Bobby?

28:41.877 --> 28:43.075
I'm trying.

28:59.855 --> 29:03.354
- You think Lilith knows we're here?
- Probably.

29:19.627 --> 29:20.657
Shh.

29:20.835 --> 29:22.461
We're here to help, okay?

29:22.630 --> 29:25.963
I'm gonna move my hand, and
we're gonna talk nice and quiet. Okay?

29:28.302 --> 29:30.971
Sir, where is your daughter?

29:31.388 --> 29:33.879
It's not... It's not her anymore.

29:34.058 --> 29:35.766
Where is she?

29:35.935 --> 29:38.094
Upstairs. In her bedroom.

29:38.270 --> 29:39.682
Okay, okay, okay. Listen to me.

29:39.856 --> 29:41.765
I want you to go downstairs
to the basement...

29:41.942 --> 29:44.349
...put a line of salt at the door.
Do you understand?

29:44.527 --> 29:47.481
- Not without my wife. No.
- Yes, without your wife.

31:24.385 --> 31:25.879
Do it.

31:30.308 --> 31:31.933
Do it.

31:34.187 --> 31:35.218
Do it.

31:35.939 --> 31:37.100
Do it.

31:40.568 --> 31:41.600
Do it.

31:43.446 --> 31:44.858
Do it. Hurry!

31:47.534 --> 31:48.910
It's not her.

31:50.454 --> 31:51.949
It's not in the girl anymore.

31:52.498 --> 31:53.529
Mommy.

31:55.042 --> 31:57.616
Mommy's here.
Mommy's here. It's okay.

32:05.178 --> 32:07.467
Oh, damn it.

32:08.641 --> 32:11.760
No matter what, you, your husband
and your daughter stay in the basement.

32:11.936 --> 32:14.972
Okay.
- Well, I hate to be a told-you-so.

32:15.147 --> 32:17.851
- All right, Ruby, where is she?
- I don't know.

32:18.025 --> 32:19.769
Well, can she get past the sprinklers?

32:19.944 --> 32:21.937
At her pay grade,
she ain't sweating holy water.

32:22.113 --> 32:25.031
Okay, you win. What do I have to do?

32:25.283 --> 32:27.074
- What do you mean?
- To save Dean.

32:27.243 --> 32:28.737
What do you need me to do?

32:28.911 --> 32:31.285
- What the hell do you think you're doing?
- Shut up.

32:31.457 --> 32:33.284
- Ruby.
- You had your chance.

32:33.792 --> 32:36.710
You can't just flip a switch.
We needed time.

32:36.879 --> 32:40.000
There's gotta be something, some way.
Whatever it is, I'll do it.

32:40.175 --> 32:42.250
Don't, Dean.
I'm not gonna let you go to hell.

32:42.426 --> 32:44.467
Yes, you are!

32:46.598 --> 32:47.713
Yes, you are.

32:49.684 --> 32:50.716
I'm sorry.

32:50.894 --> 32:52.768
I mean, this was all my fault.

32:52.938 --> 32:54.348
I know that.

32:55.941 --> 32:59.475
But what you're doing
is not gonna save me.

33:00.571 --> 33:02.480
It's only gonna kill you.

33:02.657 --> 33:04.365
Then what am I supposed to do?

33:08.371 --> 33:10.031
Keep fighting.

33:12.459 --> 33:13.833
Take care of my wheels.

33:18.799 --> 33:20.756
Sam, remember what Dad taught you.

33:21.678 --> 33:23.254
Okay?

33:24.597 --> 33:26.922
And remember what I taught you.

33:55.756 --> 33:57.795
I'm sorry, Dean.

33:59.551 --> 34:01.294
I wouldn't wish this
upon my worst enemy.

34:10.021 --> 34:11.976
- Hellhound.
- Where?

34:13.690 --> 34:15.101
There.

34:43.348 --> 34:45.886
Give me the knife.
Maybe I can fight it off.

34:46.059 --> 34:47.469
- What?
Come on.

34:47.643 --> 34:49.969
That dust won't last forever.

34:52.565 --> 34:54.273
Wait.

34:55.152 --> 34:56.315
You wanna die?

34:56.487 --> 34:57.980
Sam, that's not Ruby.

34:58.155 --> 34:59.318
It's not Ruby.

35:08.165 --> 35:11.415
- How long have you been in her?
- Not long.

35:11.585 --> 35:12.618
But I like it.

35:13.255 --> 35:15.545
It's all grown-up and pretty.

35:18.343 --> 35:19.423
And where's Ruby?

35:20.305 --> 35:23.009
She was a very bad girl.

35:23.182 --> 35:25.423
So I sent her far, far away.

35:25.601 --> 35:28.093
You know, I should've seen it before.

35:28.271 --> 35:30.180
But you all look alike to me.

35:36.447 --> 35:38.486
Hello, Sam.

35:39.783 --> 35:43.947
I've wanted to meet you
for a very long time.

35:50.462 --> 35:52.205
Your lips are soft.

35:54.799 --> 35:56.921
All right, so you have me.

35:57.302 --> 35:58.880
Let my brother go.

36:00.222 --> 36:01.632
Silly goose.

36:01.806 --> 36:04.595
You want a bargain,
you have to have something that I want.

36:05.686 --> 36:07.180
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

36:07.354 --> 36:09.015
You don't.

36:09.190 --> 36:10.766
So is this your big plan, huh?

36:11.609 --> 36:15.523
Drag me to hell, kill Sam,
and then what?

36:15.696 --> 36:18.782
- Become queen bitch?
- I don't have to answer to puppy chow.

36:27.543 --> 36:29.001
Sic him, boy.

36:33.507 --> 36:34.752
No!

36:36.469 --> 36:38.176
No, stop.

36:39.806 --> 36:41.384
Stop.

36:42.017 --> 36:43.974
Stop it! No.

36:49.316 --> 36:51.024
No. Stop it.

36:51.318 --> 36:52.896
Stop it!

36:53.070 --> 36:54.648
No.

36:54.822 --> 36:56.696
Yes.

37:32.279 --> 37:33.309
Back.

37:35.699 --> 37:37.656
I said, back.

37:41.665 --> 37:43.206
I don't think so.

38:13.365 --> 38:14.988
No.

38:17.494 --> 38:19.036
No.

38:20.872 --> 38:22.498
Dean.

38:27.588 --> 38:29.379
Dean.

38:39.100 --> 38:41.721
No!

38:42.770 --> 38:44.479
No.

38:44.648 --> 38:46.307
No.

38:48.319 --> 38:50.988
Somebody help me.

38:54.326 --> 38:56.697
Sam!

38:58.079 --> 39:01.579
Sam!
