WEBVTT

00:00.516 --> 00:01.581
<i>Oh.</i>

00:08.463 --> 00:09.994
Mateo, we get it.

00:09.995 --> 00:12.098
Okay, I can't help it.
I have an ear infection.

00:12.100 --> 00:13.766
You know, whenever I get one of those,

00:13.768 --> 00:15.802
I put a little garlic oil in my ear.

00:15.804 --> 00:18.871
It takes away the sting, and
you get to smell like the Pope.

00:18.873 --> 00:21.356
I'm telling you, a little
VapoRub on a Q-tip and...

00:21.357 --> 00:22.675
Again with the VapoRub.

00:22.677 --> 00:24.510
It's a miracle drug!

00:24.512 --> 00:26.648
Oh, why don't you go to a doctor?

00:26.649 --> 00:29.182
Our deductible is $4,000, so no.

00:29.449 --> 00:30.982
We don't have the best health insurance.

00:31.099 --> 00:32.717
I get ear infections all the time, okay?

00:32.717 --> 00:33.618
It will go away.

00:33.619 --> 00:35.254
I've had cavity for over a year.

00:35.256 --> 00:37.190
I just put a little candle wax
in it to hold me over

00:37.192 --> 00:38.391
until I win the lottery.

00:38.990 --> 00:40.059
That's horrifying.

00:40.461 --> 00:41.894
It's not so bad once the nerve is dead.

00:41.896 --> 00:43.395
You got to rub breast milk on it.

00:43.397 --> 00:45.765
Breast milk helps anything.

00:46.367 --> 00:47.797
The problem is just finding breast milk.

00:47.797 --> 00:49.150
Why would you go looking for breast milk

00:49.151 --> 00:51.002
when we have VapoRub

00:51.003 --> 00:51.918
right here in the store?

00:51.918 --> 00:52.691
Yeah, or root beer.

00:52.692 --> 00:54.527
A root beer fixes everything.

00:54.528 --> 00:55.990
Gallstones, pinkeye.

00:55.991 --> 00:57.229
It'll clean your toilet.

00:57.611 --> 00:58.646
It's kind of the perfect food.

00:58.647 --> 00:59.978
You need antibiotics,

00:59.980 --> 01:01.729
not useless home remedies.

01:01.730 --> 01:04.015
Says the guy who drinks apple
cider vinegar every morning.

01:04.016 --> 01:06.071
No, no. That's good.

01:06.072 --> 01:07.486
That has, um...

01:07.488 --> 01:09.210
It's... I'm gonna look up the article.

01:09.211 --> 01:10.389
Okay, you can use some of mine.

01:10.391 --> 01:11.823
- Oh...
- It's a bug repellant,

01:11.825 --> 01:13.625
It heals cuts. My grandma's using it

01:13.627 --> 01:15.727
- to shrink her moles.
- Well your grandma's a moron.

01:15.729 --> 01:17.263
Well the moles are shrinking, Dina,

01:17.264 --> 01:18.530
so who's the moron?

01:18.532 --> 01:20.016
You don't mess with moles.
You see a doctor.

01:20.017 --> 01:21.399
I recently had one removed.

01:21.402 --> 01:23.503
Sounds like someone's
had some work done.

01:23.676 --> 01:25.950
That's very Beverly Hills of you.

01:25.951 --> 01:28.339
Uh, no, Glenn, it was a melanoma,

01:28.340 --> 01:30.270
and we caught it early so guess
who has two thumbs

01:30.270 --> 01:32.310
and is cancer free. Everybody but Dale.

01:33.148 --> 01:34.379
Enzymes...

01:35.154 --> 01:37.579
Apple cider vinegar has good enzymes.

01:42.728 --> 01:44.189
<i>We appreciate your patience.</i>

01:44.190 --> 01:46.664
<i>Please state your reason
for requesting a</i>

01:46.666 --> 01:48.065
<i>dermatologist.</i>

01:48.067 --> 01:50.872
Uh, I have a mole on my, um...

01:52.502 --> 01:53.437
You know.

01:53.439 --> 01:54.615
<i>I didn't get that.</i>

01:54.616 --> 01:56.907
Yeah, I'm not comfortable
talking to a lady.

01:56.909 --> 01:59.410
Is there a male robot I could talk to?

01:59.412 --> 02:00.811
<i>I didn't get that.</i>

02:00.813 --> 02:03.414
It's on my bathing suit area.

02:03.416 --> 02:04.647
<i>I didn't get that.</i>

02:04.648 --> 02:06.951
Could I just make an
appointment? Please.

02:06.953 --> 02:10.588
<i>The next appointment
with a dermatologist is...</i>

02:10.590 --> 02:13.791
<i>June 17, 2018.</i>

02:13.793 --> 02:15.859
That's six months away.

02:15.861 --> 02:17.661
<i>If you are finished with your call</i>

02:17.663 --> 02:20.083
<i>please press five or hang up.</i>

02:20.600 --> 02:23.186
<i>Please hold for a quick survey.</i>

02:23.603 --> 02:24.763
Oh, okay.

02:26.105 --> 02:29.006
Oh, hey, what sounds more
like a real charity,

02:29.008 --> 02:32.977
The Mateo Project,
or the Liwanag League?

02:32.979 --> 02:34.304
This is crazy.

02:34.452 --> 02:35.846
We shouldn't have to invent a charity

02:35.848 --> 02:37.014
every single time an employee

02:37.016 --> 02:38.949
needs money to see a doctor.

02:38.951 --> 02:40.313
The Mateo Project.

02:40.314 --> 02:42.086
Really? I think the Liwanag League.

02:42.088 --> 02:44.121
I mean, scrambling
to pull money together

02:44.123 --> 02:45.889
whenever somebody gets sick? That's...

02:45.891 --> 02:47.332
That's inhuman.

02:47.333 --> 02:48.959
Would love to get people to pony up

02:48.961 --> 02:50.661
before we get sick, but planning ahead

02:50.663 --> 02:52.062
just really isn't our style.

02:52.064 --> 02:54.465
No, you were right, Mateo Project.

02:54.467 --> 02:57.635
Wait, no, that's
actually a really good idea.

02:57.637 --> 02:59.703
If we all contribute a little
bit of money every month,

02:59.705 --> 03:01.972
we could create our own health fund.

03:03.142 --> 03:05.009
Oh, my God.

03:05.011 --> 03:06.510
Jonah.

03:06.512 --> 03:07.845
That's amazing.

03:07.847 --> 03:08.504
Right?

03:08.505 --> 03:10.117
You just did it. You...

03:10.750 --> 03:12.683
You solved healthcare.

03:12.685 --> 03:14.151
- I mean...
- Okay.

03:14.153 --> 03:15.886
So many brilliant minds have
tried before you

03:15.888 --> 03:17.655
and they couldn't, and then
here you are...

03:17.657 --> 03:19.189
- Okay.
- Jonah the working class

03:19.191 --> 03:20.924
savant with a few business
school credits.

03:20.926 --> 03:22.182
Jonah, where are you going?

03:22.183 --> 03:23.994
Together we could solve immigration.

03:23.996 --> 03:25.386
Are you out of your mind?

03:25.387 --> 03:27.498
I can't give you meds
without a prescription.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.266
I could lose my license, go to jail.

03:29.268 --> 03:31.168
Okay, sorry.

03:31.170 --> 03:32.414
Calm down.

03:34.000 --> 03:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:47.253 --> 03:49.453
Uh, yeah, buddy. I can hook you up.

03:49.455 --> 03:52.356
So, you looking to get wasted
or just a nice clean high?

03:52.669 --> 03:55.103
Um, just... antibiotics.

03:55.212 --> 03:57.987
A.B.'s, old school, I feel you.

03:57.988 --> 04:00.296
The thing about pills is
they're so tiny,

04:00.299 --> 04:01.598
they're hard to keep track of.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.334
Sometimes I miscount.

04:03.336 --> 04:05.336
So bad.

04:05.338 --> 04:08.497
Okeydoke, let's see what I
can throw your way.

04:08.498 --> 04:10.892
Lipitor, Lipitor, Lipitor.

04:10.893 --> 04:11.842
You know, what the hell?

04:12.487 --> 04:14.487
Does that look like Oxy
or a SweeTart to you?

04:14.489 --> 04:16.022
I don't know.

04:17.659 --> 04:19.425
I don't know. That's a headscratcher.

04:19.769 --> 04:21.036
Mm. Oh, here we go.

04:21.125 --> 04:22.729
- Expired amoxicillin.
- Okay.

04:22.731 --> 04:24.130
Perfect.

04:24.132 --> 04:26.099
- Gotcha.
- Thank you.

04:26.101 --> 04:27.734
- How much do I owe you?
- What?

04:28.103 --> 04:29.869
Are you crazy? You don't just
hand me the money.

04:30.091 --> 04:32.138
Behind the Just for Men.
Medium Dark Brown.

04:32.140 --> 04:33.269
Okay.

04:36.143 --> 04:37.377
Oh.

04:38.106 --> 04:40.013
That was Oxy.

04:41.089 --> 04:43.010
Hey, howdy-do.

04:43.457 --> 04:45.461
Any room at the inn for a fella

04:45.462 --> 04:49.228
with a PB and J minus the PB?

04:49.230 --> 04:50.763
Sure.

04:50.764 --> 04:52.778
We were just talking about
how my boyfriend Jerry's doing.

04:52.779 --> 04:54.800
- Oh.
- He has a vegetal growth

04:54.802 --> 04:56.669
on his teeth due to the coma, and uh...

04:56.671 --> 04:59.772
Hey, remember how before we
were talking about melanomas.

04:59.774 --> 05:01.774
How do you know if a mole
is one of those?

05:01.776 --> 05:03.205
Well, there's lots of warning signs.

05:03.284 --> 05:04.076
Is it getting bigger?

05:04.078 --> 05:06.481
Sometimes it gets bigger.

05:06.481 --> 05:08.482
Sometimes it gets smaller...

05:08.483 --> 05:10.916
depending on factors.

05:11.605 --> 05:13.168
Sounds suspicious.
You want me to take a look?

05:13.168 --> 05:14.687
Definitely not.

05:14.689 --> 05:17.456
Besides, I got a doctor's
appointment in six months so...

05:17.458 --> 05:18.984
Oh, I wouldn't wait.

05:19.234 --> 05:20.900
If it's cancer and they catch it early,

05:20.903 --> 05:22.803
it's just a simple surgery.

05:23.104 --> 05:24.019
But the longer you wait,

05:24.020 --> 05:25.794
they got to cut deeper

05:25.795 --> 05:30.309
and deeper and deeper

05:30.311 --> 05:32.345
till essentially there's nothing left.

05:33.982 --> 05:34.997
Don't eat it!

05:38.974 --> 05:39.575
Ow.

05:48.467 --> 05:50.596
So instead of relying on the jar method,

05:50.598 --> 05:53.564
we would each contribute
20 bucks a month,

05:53.565 --> 05:55.570
and then the fund grows,

05:55.571 --> 05:56.835
and then we pay it out...

05:56.892 --> 05:58.358
Slow your roll.

05:58.747 --> 06:00.339
This sounds like a pyramid scheme.

06:00.341 --> 06:03.445
Guys, this is not
a pyramid scheme, okay?

06:03.445 --> 06:05.703
A pyramid scheme needs to recruit.

06:05.703 --> 06:08.477
This... what's... this is...

06:09.916 --> 06:12.853
Technically, this is recruiting, but...

06:13.416 --> 06:15.283
Oh, I think this is going really well.

06:15.285 --> 06:17.085
Well I smell socialism,

06:17.087 --> 06:18.181
and we all know where that leads.

06:18.182 --> 06:20.421
High literacy rates,
low infant mortality,

06:20.423 --> 06:22.390
increased quality of life, fjords.

06:22.392 --> 06:25.827
Uh, no, the government
watching us on the toilet.

06:25.829 --> 06:28.503
Hey, guys, look. I know that this idea

06:28.534 --> 06:31.132
seems really not well thought out

06:31.134 --> 06:33.647
and that it's totally naive.

06:37.752 --> 06:39.393
That's all I wanted to say.

06:40.759 --> 06:41.409
Thank you, Amy.

06:41.798 --> 06:43.097
I actually think it sounds

06:43.099 --> 06:44.198
like a really good idea.

06:44.200 --> 06:45.700
All right.

06:45.702 --> 06:46.868
Thank you.

06:46.870 --> 06:48.536
You know what, I'm in too.

06:48.538 --> 06:50.171
If it is a pyramid scheme,

06:50.173 --> 06:52.907
at least I will be on the top

06:52.909 --> 06:54.375
ahead of all these suckers.

06:54.377 --> 06:56.077
That is sound logic, Marcus.

06:56.408 --> 06:57.906
You know what, keep them coming.

06:57.907 --> 06:59.158
Spread the word.

06:59.201 --> 07:00.782
The more the merrier.

07:02.452 --> 07:03.918
Sorry it's so damp.

07:03.920 --> 07:05.319
Thank you.

07:05.321 --> 07:06.832
Wait, so nobody thinks

07:06.870 --> 07:08.504
that this is problematic?

07:14.665 --> 07:16.665
_

07:18.880 --> 07:19.979
Oh, my God.

07:21.783 --> 07:23.950
What are you doing here?

07:23.952 --> 07:26.552
Uh, you told me to stop
by for my review.

07:26.554 --> 07:29.155
Yeah, well, now's not a good
time, so come back later.

07:29.609 --> 07:30.466
Okay.

07:39.567 --> 07:41.100
So excited about this.

07:41.102 --> 07:42.635
I can finally get my inhaler.

07:42.637 --> 07:43.803
Oh.

07:43.805 --> 07:45.838
I'm glad it all worked out.

07:46.207 --> 07:48.341
I just couldn't put the money
together before.

07:48.343 --> 07:50.309
I reduced my shifts because of Jerry,

07:50.311 --> 07:52.145
and I had to pay to put one
of my cats down.

07:52.147 --> 07:54.147
She ate one of my other cats.

07:54.149 --> 07:56.315
Well, I don't know what to say to that,

07:56.317 --> 08:00.253
but I'm glad that it all worked
out with the inhaler.

08:00.255 --> 08:01.988
Thanks.

08:05.927 --> 08:07.660
- Oh.
- Oh.

08:07.662 --> 08:09.996
All right.

08:11.933 --> 08:15.216
God, it feels good to help, you know.

08:15.217 --> 08:16.702
Word must be getting around.

08:16.704 --> 08:18.738
Yeah, you're a real saint.

08:19.005 --> 08:21.138
Hey, I'm gonna need you
to clean the men's room.

08:21.150 --> 08:22.839
Someone dumped chili in the urinal.

08:22.840 --> 08:23.910
You know what I mean though?

08:23.912 --> 08:26.079
To like actually accomplish something,

08:26.081 --> 08:27.780
even when the haters are
calling you naive.

08:27.782 --> 08:29.449
- Mm-hmm.
- I wonder if this is

08:29.451 --> 08:33.006
how Obama felt when he passed Obamacare.

08:33.006 --> 08:34.780
A lot of people still hate Obama.

08:36.655 --> 08:38.788
- Thanks for taking a look.
- Yeah, sure.

08:38.789 --> 08:40.256
Yes.

08:42.527 --> 08:44.561
I'm sorry, this is so awkward.

08:44.563 --> 08:46.529
Here, this will help, I'm sure.

08:46.531 --> 08:47.964
What... what are you doing?

08:47.966 --> 08:49.341
I'm making you less self-conscious.

08:49.342 --> 08:50.417
No, you don't have to do that.

08:50.418 --> 08:53.553
- Hey, it's my pleasure.
- No, I...

08:54.651 --> 08:55.939
really rather you didn't.

08:55.941 --> 08:57.774
Oh, is that a fact.

08:58.255 --> 08:59.909
Well and I'm so hideous
you couldn't possibly

08:59.911 --> 09:01.811
- look at my rig, is that it?
- No, I just...

09:01.813 --> 09:03.314
You think your penis is
better than mine?

09:03.314 --> 09:04.982
- No, I...
- Go on, look at it.

09:05.303 --> 09:07.236
- Look at it.
- I don't want to.

09:07.381 --> 09:08.985
Do me a kindness, Glenn,

09:09.530 --> 09:10.787
and look at my penis.

09:11.187 --> 09:11.800
Do it.

09:16.567 --> 09:18.695
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

09:19.409 --> 09:20.496
Me too.

09:20.498 --> 09:22.703
I'm excited to get
my cholesterol checked.

09:22.704 --> 09:26.302
Last time was ten years ago,
and it was over 300.

09:27.110 --> 09:29.210
And I have not improved my diet.

09:29.212 --> 09:31.277
I wish we had this in place when I fell.

09:31.278 --> 09:34.182
I had to have all of this...
done at a vet.

09:34.184 --> 09:36.606
Yeah, Jonah's pretty smart, huh?

09:36.607 --> 09:38.486
Well, I mean, it wasn't
really that big of a deal.

09:38.488 --> 09:41.289
We were just discussing
our healthcare situation,

09:41.291 --> 09:42.957
and we came up with it.

09:42.959 --> 09:44.893
Oh, so you helped him think of it?

09:44.895 --> 09:47.328
No. No, no, no, Jonah is
definitely the one

09:47.330 --> 09:48.963
who took the ball and ran with it.

09:48.965 --> 09:50.698
I'm just the one who
like... I don't know...

09:50.700 --> 09:52.167
like invented the ball or whatever.

09:52.169 --> 09:54.235
I know what this is.

09:54.237 --> 09:55.837
You're going through a divorce.

09:55.839 --> 09:57.305
Now Jonah's being the mother bear

09:57.307 --> 09:58.873
that you usually are.

09:58.875 --> 10:00.341
Plus, the divorce.

10:00.343 --> 10:02.744
- No, that's not what I...
- Guys.

10:02.746 --> 10:04.212
Play along. She needs this.

10:04.214 --> 10:06.147
- You did it.
- Oh, my God, thank you.

10:06.149 --> 10:07.615
- No.
- See?

10:08.022 --> 10:09.213
You're important too.

10:11.397 --> 10:12.197
Oh.

10:12.795 --> 10:13.888
- Ah, ah.
- Oh.

10:13.890 --> 10:15.723
- I can feel it fizzing.
- Oh, yeah.

10:16.175 --> 10:17.192
That means it's working.

10:19.689 --> 10:21.215
Oh, that's good root beer.

10:27.106 --> 10:28.770
- What is that?
- That's a mole.

10:29.141 --> 10:30.220
That's what it looks like.

10:30.221 --> 10:32.509
You've just drawn a circle
on a piece of paper.

10:32.511 --> 10:33.925
This doesn't tell me anything.

10:33.926 --> 10:35.446
Just let me take a look at the mole.

10:35.448 --> 10:37.465
Can we please just do it this way?

10:37.574 --> 10:40.384
Listen, I have seen literally
hundreds of penises.

10:40.386 --> 10:43.153
Okay? There's nothing you
could possibly have

10:43.155 --> 10:46.223
going on with your junk
that would faze me.

10:46.483 --> 10:47.528
Okay, um...

10:48.461 --> 10:50.127
Okay, but can we please do it

10:50.129 --> 10:52.129
without me having to see your vagina?

10:53.499 --> 10:54.909
I think we can do it that way.

10:54.910 --> 10:56.056
- Okay.
- Yeah.

10:56.390 --> 10:56.948
Hey.

10:57.472 --> 10:59.172
Have you signed Jonah's card yet?

10:59.174 --> 11:00.973
- What card?
- A "Thank you" card

11:00.975 --> 11:02.909
for coming up with the idea
for the health fund.

11:02.911 --> 11:05.178
God, he's an adorable little hero.

11:05.180 --> 11:07.046
I signed mine from The Rock.

11:07.384 --> 11:08.693
I like to keep it light.

11:10.685 --> 11:13.453
So, um... just checking.

11:13.455 --> 11:15.988
The whole health fund idea,

11:16.357 --> 11:18.201
that was all you, right?

11:18.366 --> 11:19.225
What?

11:19.227 --> 11:20.993
'Cause I'm just remembering that...

11:20.995 --> 11:24.864
I was there, and I think I'm
the one who suggested it.

11:24.866 --> 11:27.300
You didn't want to do it.

11:27.302 --> 11:29.602
No, I didn't, but it was my idea.

11:29.604 --> 11:33.125
And just because the seed
doesn't become the plant,

11:33.641 --> 11:36.001
doesn't mean you don't
give the seed credit

11:36.002 --> 11:38.182
when everyone starts
freaking out about the plant.

11:38.183 --> 11:39.187
I don't know what plant

11:39.188 --> 11:41.484
everybody would be freaking out about.

11:41.486 --> 11:43.553
Oh, of course, the ghost orchid.

11:43.555 --> 11:46.356
But I think I do know what
you're getting at here.

11:46.358 --> 11:48.405
- You want credit.
- What? No.

11:48.406 --> 11:50.026
No, I don't want credit.

11:50.028 --> 11:51.394
I just want people to know
that I had the idea.

11:51.396 --> 11:53.118
Sure. Hold on a sec.

11:53.898 --> 11:55.865
Attention Cloud 9 employees

11:55.867 --> 11:58.001
<i>just to be clear, the health fund</i>

11:58.003 --> 11:59.902
was actually Amy's idea.

11:59.904 --> 12:01.904
So, if you're thanking me,

12:01.906 --> 12:04.807
please remember
to also thank Amy as well.

12:04.809 --> 12:07.677
She's just as responsible
for all of this as I am.

12:07.679 --> 12:10.747
No, I... No "thank you" s,
just the truth.

12:11.215 --> 12:15.463
Thank you. I know that that's
sort of awkward to have to ask

12:15.464 --> 12:16.843
for credit, and I just...

12:16.844 --> 12:18.577
you kind of put me in that position.

12:18.579 --> 12:21.046
Yeah, the health fund is
a total disaster.

12:21.048 --> 12:22.457
We're in a lot of trouble.

12:25.323 --> 12:26.857
This is absurd.

12:27.523 --> 12:30.549
I don't want you to associate
my penis with my face.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.160
But I can still see your face.

12:32.504 --> 12:34.471
Well, pretend there's
another guy in here.

12:34.473 --> 12:36.406
- Oh, God.
- He's a little fella,

12:36.408 --> 12:38.575
and his penis is the same
height as mine.

12:38.577 --> 12:41.711
And I'm just leaning over his
back so you still see my face,

12:41.713 --> 12:43.680
and he doesn't say a word
because I threatened

12:43.682 --> 12:45.182
to fire him if he made a peep.

12:45.184 --> 12:47.317
- Okay?
- I can pretend that.

12:47.319 --> 12:48.685
Okay.

12:48.687 --> 12:50.296
Okay, so in the first

12:50.297 --> 12:54.568
four hours, you've managed
to commit us to $37,000.

12:54.569 --> 12:56.059
The claims just kept coming,

12:56.061 --> 12:57.677
and, you know, it's like
that opening in "Star Wars"

12:57.678 --> 12:59.297
where the words zoom past you.

12:59.297 --> 13:00.463
And at first it's cool,

13:00.465 --> 13:01.498
but eventually you just can't keep up.

13:01.500 --> 13:02.766
Wait, Sandra alone has

13:02.768 --> 13:05.168
asthma, rheumatoid arthritis,

13:05.170 --> 13:08.138
sciatica, fibromyalgia,
leaky gut syndrome,

13:08.140 --> 13:09.539
this just keeps going.

13:09.541 --> 13:11.341
We just got to keep signing people up.

13:11.343 --> 13:13.043
That's all, okay?

13:13.045 --> 13:15.512
If we get everybody
in the backroom to sign up

13:15.514 --> 13:17.380
then that will pay for these people.

13:17.382 --> 13:19.216
And then we can go to other branches

13:19.218 --> 13:20.951
and then that will pay
for the backroom...

13:20.953 --> 13:23.536
This is a pyramid scheme.

13:23.537 --> 13:25.837
Shh. How could it be?
I'm not benefiting.

13:26.792 --> 13:28.792
What is this?

13:28.794 --> 13:31.261
Sandra drew a picture to save time.

13:35.133 --> 13:37.300
Here she comes.

13:45.152 --> 13:46.014
I don't see a mole.

13:46.015 --> 13:48.126
Oh, it's on the undercarriage.

13:48.127 --> 13:49.880
- Oh.
- No, don't touch it.

13:49.881 --> 13:53.225
Well, how am supposed to look
underneath if I don't pick it up?

13:58.275 --> 14:00.010
This isn't... okay, this isn't working.

14:00.011 --> 14:01.667
Why don't I just lift it up with a pen?

14:01.669 --> 14:02.611
Okay.

14:02.612 --> 14:04.036
Wait, no, not the blue one.

14:04.038 --> 14:05.337
I sign paychecks with that.

14:05.339 --> 14:06.526
Fine.

14:06.527 --> 14:08.473
What about this broken Snoopy pencil?

14:08.475 --> 14:10.442
Okay.

14:10.444 --> 14:12.377
Don't use the pointy end.

14:12.379 --> 14:13.712
It's not a shish kabob.

14:13.714 --> 14:16.215
So you're cancelling the health fund?

14:16.217 --> 14:17.384
Um, no.

14:17.385 --> 14:19.585
The fund will continue.

14:19.587 --> 14:21.853
It will just be more of a...

14:21.855 --> 14:25.490
Selective, sort of
case-by-case situation.

14:25.492 --> 14:27.426
- You're kicking us out.
- No.

14:27.427 --> 14:29.139
- No.
- No. No.

14:29.140 --> 14:33.098
It's just, you know, our vision
was a lot more idealistic

14:33.100 --> 14:36.147
than the realities of the world.

14:36.147 --> 14:38.170
Guys, we are really sorry,

14:38.172 --> 14:40.672
but we are giving you
back your premiums.

14:40.674 --> 14:42.407
- Isaac.
- How about that?

14:42.409 --> 14:45.444
- There you go.
- Sandra.

14:46.111 --> 14:46.845
No.

14:47.291 --> 14:48.957
You're trying to [bleep] us.

14:48.959 --> 14:50.426
Whoa.

14:50.428 --> 14:51.860
You're trying to [bleep] us.

14:51.862 --> 14:53.562
Well you picked the wrong day

14:53.564 --> 14:55.464
to [bleep] with Sandra Kaluiokalani!

14:55.466 --> 14:57.966
Oh, okay, Sandra, just calm down.

14:57.968 --> 15:00.235
No! I won't calm down.

15:00.237 --> 15:02.471
We have a contract, and I can sue.

15:02.473 --> 15:04.707
So, figure it out!

15:07.278 --> 15:09.311
Can I help you to your car ma'am?

15:09.313 --> 15:12.214
Your ability to remain
un-erect is really impressive.

15:12.216 --> 15:13.155
Thank you.

15:15.219 --> 15:17.252
- Well?
- Honestly, I don't know.

15:17.254 --> 15:19.321
I think I should text a pic
of it to my derm.

15:19.323 --> 15:21.190
- Okay.
- All right.

15:21.192 --> 15:23.125
Hey, Glenn, I'm here for my review.

15:24.528 --> 15:27.262
That's... Glenn's penis.

15:29.066 --> 15:31.200
Glenn's penis.

15:39.477 --> 15:41.410
Guys, just... just...

15:41.857 --> 15:43.890
Okay! Listen up.

15:44.181 --> 15:46.745
I know there are a lot
of rumors flying around

15:46.745 --> 15:49.889
about the health fund, but we
are not kicking people out.

15:50.378 --> 15:53.814
So we have Group A,

15:53.816 --> 15:56.851
and also for those with slightly
more health requirements

15:56.853 --> 15:58.278
we have Group B.

15:58.279 --> 16:00.621
Each group is exactly the same,

16:01.003 --> 16:02.211
and also different.

16:02.415 --> 16:05.760
Those in Group A will
continue to pay $20 a month,

16:05.762 --> 16:10.164
and those in Group B,
based on projected expenses,

16:10.464 --> 16:13.131
will pay...$200 a month.

16:18.408 --> 16:21.175
I knew it. You two are trying
to rip us off.

16:21.650 --> 16:23.717
You're sitting up there
in your ivory towers

16:23.719 --> 16:25.051
eating your exotic fruits

16:25.053 --> 16:26.586
with two scoops of ice cream.

16:26.588 --> 16:27.606
You're bathing in gold.

16:27.607 --> 16:29.589
Nobody is doing any of those things.

16:29.591 --> 16:30.790
Yeah, hold up. How come I'm in Group B?

16:30.792 --> 16:32.392
- Y'all Group-B'ed me?
- Yes.

16:32.394 --> 16:33.793
But not because of the wheelchair.

16:33.795 --> 16:35.395
Because you eat too many Cheez-Its

16:35.397 --> 16:36.596
- for one human stomach.
- Oh, come on.

16:36.598 --> 16:37.240
This sucks.

16:37.241 --> 16:39.132
You have me in Group B with Sandra,

16:39.134 --> 16:40.500
and she has gout.

16:40.502 --> 16:42.102
Jesus Christ, Sandra,

16:42.104 --> 16:43.837
how many things do you have
wrong with you?

16:43.839 --> 16:45.005
Well, what about Marcus?

16:45.007 --> 16:46.239
He shouldn't be in Group A.

16:46.241 --> 16:47.641
His leg is messed up.

16:47.643 --> 16:48.954
I've got a handle on it.

16:49.981 --> 16:51.449
Okay.

16:51.450 --> 16:52.753
Oh, my God.

16:52.754 --> 16:54.422
That looks infected.

16:54.423 --> 16:56.151
Not a chance. Every night I soak it

16:56.152 --> 16:57.838
in my apartment complex's hot tub,

16:57.839 --> 16:59.440
and chlorine will kill anything.

16:59.441 --> 17:01.324
- What?
- Ridiculous.

17:01.326 --> 17:03.225
Okay, guys, I know it's not perfect...

17:06.164 --> 17:07.630
I'm feeling a sense...

17:07.632 --> 17:09.665
It's complicated.

17:10.621 --> 17:14.291
Wait, wait, wait.

17:14.502 --> 17:15.486
Hold up.

17:15.487 --> 17:16.994
So if I'm Platinum Select,

17:16.996 --> 17:19.449
does that mean that I get the
stuff in the Gryffindor tier?

17:19.450 --> 17:22.787
No, no, if you want things
in the Gryffindor tier,

17:22.788 --> 17:25.574
you need to upgrade either
to the Platinum Ultra

17:25.575 --> 17:26.739
or the Platinum Blue.

17:26.740 --> 17:28.636
- Okay.
- I have a question.

17:28.637 --> 17:30.166
Who gave you the right to play God?

17:30.167 --> 17:32.503
All I said was the fund can't
pay for a live-in nurse.

17:32.504 --> 17:34.872
That doesn't mean I want
to let Jerry die.

17:34.873 --> 17:36.678
Right, you're just not willing
to lift a finger to help him.

17:36.679 --> 17:38.077
Understood loud and clear.

17:38.078 --> 17:39.983
- Thanks Jonah.
- Okay, look, I get it

17:39.984 --> 17:42.897
up to Diamond Plus, but when
you get down to Wall of Fire,

17:42.898 --> 17:43.988
it's like, "What?"

17:43.989 --> 17:45.791
Guys, we're making it too difficult.

17:45.792 --> 17:46.991
We just got to simplify.

17:46.992 --> 17:50.630
Cover everything, exclude no
one, and make it affordable.

17:50.631 --> 17:51.920
- Come on.
- Why didn't we think of that.

17:51.921 --> 17:53.694
Okay, okay, okay.

17:53.784 --> 17:55.340
It seems to be the problem is

17:55.341 --> 17:57.441
that some of us are going to
use the fund more than others,

17:57.442 --> 17:59.838
but no one wants to put in more money
than they're going to take out.

17:59.839 --> 18:01.434
Yes, exactly. Thank you.

18:01.435 --> 18:02.902
So my suggestion would be,

18:02.903 --> 18:05.419
what if we restrict the fund
to those of us who are able

18:05.420 --> 18:07.482
to complete a series
of "Ninja Warrior" type

18:07.483 --> 18:08.606
physical challenges?

18:08.607 --> 18:09.903
Mm, see, I was with you for so long.

18:09.904 --> 18:12.398
Okay, how about if you can
jump on a table then you're in.

18:12.399 --> 18:14.661
- No, we're not doing that.
- Works for me.

18:14.662 --> 18:16.286
There's no way you can jump on a table.

18:16.287 --> 18:17.804
I can absolutely jump on a table.

18:17.805 --> 18:19.438
No one needs to jump on a table.

18:19.439 --> 18:20.872
I think this guy needs
to jump on a table.

18:20.873 --> 18:22.382
Yeah, I think if you can do it,

18:22.383 --> 18:24.096
I will totally sleep with Marcus.

18:24.097 --> 18:25.720
- Wait, what?
- Isaac!

18:25.721 --> 18:28.408
Isaac! Isaac!

18:28.410 --> 18:31.110
No, it doesn't mean anything, Isaac.

18:31.112 --> 18:34.113
Isaac! Isaac! Isaac!

18:34.115 --> 18:35.415
Oh!

18:35.417 --> 18:36.549
No, no.

18:42.991 --> 18:44.572
Are you sure you should be

18:44.573 --> 18:46.446
putting superglue on an open wound?

18:46.447 --> 18:47.605
Mm, yeah, probably.

18:48.236 --> 18:49.284
Bodies are weird.

18:50.167 --> 18:51.551
Ah, hey.

18:51.552 --> 18:53.957
How about that jump, huh?

18:53.958 --> 18:55.245
- It was good.
- Yeah.

18:55.246 --> 18:57.081
- Real high, buddy.
- All right.

18:57.921 --> 18:59.135
Oh, no, no.

18:59.136 --> 19:00.781
- Oh, God.
- Shoot, I'm stuck.

19:02.899 --> 19:04.790
Hey, dude, looks like your lucky day.

19:05.503 --> 19:07.564
Probably like a hundred bucks in there.

19:07.565 --> 19:09.414
That is amazing

19:09.415 --> 19:11.463
that people are so generous.

19:11.464 --> 19:14.448
Yeah, customers, employees,
everyone just pitched in.

19:14.449 --> 19:17.052
I'm gonna buy
that faux Gucci messenger bag.

19:17.053 --> 19:18.780
What about your ear?

19:18.781 --> 19:21.090
Excuse you, my body, my choice.

19:34.869 --> 19:38.784
And here's to the health fund,
a total failure.

19:39.362 --> 19:42.494
That was a really bad idea you had.

19:42.495 --> 19:43.407
What was your thing again?

19:43.408 --> 19:44.880
You were a seed?

19:44.881 --> 19:46.861
I don't know. It made sense at the time.

19:46.862 --> 19:48.358
- It was like a...
- Did it?

19:48.359 --> 19:50.420
- Yes, it made perfect sense.
- Walk me through

19:50.428 --> 19:51.516
- that metaphor.
- The seed...

19:51.517 --> 19:52.998
- Uh-huh.
- Then the...

19:52.999 --> 19:54.566
- It blooms.
- It doesn't matter.

19:54.567 --> 19:55.896
- So you were the seed...
- Who cares, it's in the past.

19:55.897 --> 19:57.117
- Drink your beer.
- Hey.

19:57.118 --> 19:58.793
Hey, guys, what're you doing?

19:58.794 --> 20:00.212
Oh, you know, we're just...

20:00.213 --> 20:03.498
hiding out until everyone
stops being pissed at us.

20:03.499 --> 20:05.188
- Can I join you?
- Uh...

20:05.189 --> 20:06.719
Yes, of course.

20:06.720 --> 20:08.013
- Cool.
- Yeah.

20:09.679 --> 20:12.395
- There you are.
- Ah, thank you.

20:13.383 --> 20:15.379
This is nice.

20:15.380 --> 20:16.025
Mm.

20:18.496 --> 20:20.428
- Cheers.
- Yahtzee.

20:23.823 --> 20:24.884
Hm.

20:25.134 --> 20:27.194
My derm's taking forever
getting back to me.

20:27.195 --> 20:29.348
Such a power move.

20:29.349 --> 20:30.842
Classic derm.

20:30.843 --> 20:32.116
What if it is cancer?

20:33.033 --> 20:35.288
The Sturgis genes will die with me.

20:36.353 --> 20:37.447
I never had kids.

20:37.939 --> 20:39.812
Well, I mean, I fostered, but you know,

20:39.813 --> 20:42.014
none straight out of the doodle.

20:42.374 --> 20:44.062
Well, there's still time.

20:44.250 --> 20:45.872
Jerusha's still got a few years left,

20:45.873 --> 20:47.956
and there's always science.

20:47.957 --> 20:50.154
In a few years we'll probably
all have pig organs.

20:50.156 --> 20:52.122
Yeah, you're right.

20:52.124 --> 20:53.991
Oh.

20:53.993 --> 20:56.193
You're in the clear. It's not melanoma.

20:57.830 --> 20:59.096
Yeah.

20:59.098 --> 21:01.432
Well, I should get back to work.

21:03.102 --> 21:03.881
Dina.

21:04.970 --> 21:05.899
Thank you.

21:06.472 --> 21:07.430
You're welcome.

21:08.340 --> 21:09.150
Also...

21:10.209 --> 21:11.919
Never forget that I have this.

21:17.817 --> 21:19.243
I'm gonna have a baby.
