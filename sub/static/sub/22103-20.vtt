18:36.071 --> 18:37.551
AND WELCOME TO THE BEACH.

18:37.681 --> 18:39.074
MY NAME IS LIEUTENANT
MITCH BUCHANNON

18:39.205 --> 18:41.032
AND THIS LIEUTENANT
STEPHANIE HOLDEN.

18:41.163 --> 18:42.338
-HI, WELCOME TO BAYWATCH.

18:42.469 --> 18:43.339
-THANK YOU.

18:43.470 --> 18:45.211
-THANK YOU.

18:45.341 --> 18:47.648
-WE WANTED TO HAVE THIS ON-SITE
BUDGET HEARING AT THE BEACH

18:47.778 --> 18:49.563
SO YOU CAN GET THE
FEELING OF WHAT IT'S LIKE

18:49.693 --> 18:50.912
TO BE IN OUR ENVIRONMENT.

18:51.652 --> 18:54.568
ALSO, WE WANTED TO GIVE YOU
A CHANCE TO ENJOY THE SUN,

18:54.698 --> 18:58.311
THE RELAXING SOUND OF
THE SURF, AND THE BEACH.

18:59.268 --> 19:03.054
AND THAT'S WHY PEOPLE COME HERE,
TO PUT THEIR WORRIES ASIDE,

19:03.185 --> 19:04.665
TO RELAX AND HAVE A GOOD TIME.

19:07.102 --> 19:08.495
-IF YOU LOOK TO YOUR LEFT
AND THEN TO YOUR RIGHT,

19:08.625 --> 19:11.628
YOU'LL SEE LIFEGUARD
TOWERS EVERY 200 YARDS.

19:11.759 --> 19:14.109
THEY GO ON LIKE
THIS FOR 73 MILES.

19:14.805 --> 19:17.895
THAT'S 73 MILES OF BEACHES
THAT WE HAVE TO SAFEGUARD.

19:19.723 --> 19:22.422
WE USED TO OPEN EVERY
TOWER ON CROWDED DAYS,

19:22.944 --> 19:24.337
NOW WE'RE LUCKY IF WE
OPEN EVERY OTHER TOWER.

19:26.208 --> 19:28.819
IF THE PROPOSED BUDGET
CUTBACKS BECOME A REALITY,

19:29.733 --> 19:32.475
THEN ONE LIFEGUARD WILL BE
RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE PEOPLE

19:32.606 --> 19:34.695
ON THE BEACH BETWEEN
THESE TWO JETTIES.

19:36.610 --> 19:41.832
ONE LIFEGUARD, THAT'S ONE
LIFEGUARD FOR 6,000 PEOPLE.

19:44.139 --> 19:46.315
-I WAS TALKING TO A
LIFEGUARD TRAINING OFFICER

19:46.446 --> 19:48.317
FROM NEW ZEALAND,
AND HE ASKED ME

19:48.448 --> 19:49.971
HOW MANY DROWNINGS WE HAD.

19:50.667 --> 19:52.060
WHEN I SAID TWO HE ASKED ME

19:52.191 --> 19:54.497
IF THAT WAS A
PARTICULARLY BAD WEEKEND.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.283
I COMPLETELY BLEW HIS
MIND WHEN I TOLD HIM

19:57.413 --> 19:58.936
THAT THAT WAS FOR
THE ENTIRE YEAR.

19:59.850 --> 20:01.200
HE SAID THAT THEY HAVE

20:01.330 --> 20:03.376
MORE DROWNINGS THAN
THAT IN A BAD DAY.

20:03.506 --> 20:05.813
I MEAN JUST GOES TO
SHOW YOU HOW GOOD

20:05.943 --> 20:09.033
OUR LIFEGUARDING PROGRAM
IS WHEN YOU CONSIDER

20:09.164 --> 20:12.602
THAT NEARLY 60 MILLION PEOPLE
CAME TO OUR BEACHES LAST YEAR

20:13.212 --> 20:14.865
AND IN NEW ZEALAND, THERE'S ONLY

20:14.996 --> 20:17.216
THREE MILLION PEOPLE
IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.

20:17.346 --> 20:19.130
-ALL OF US ARE
AWARE HOW EXCEPTIONAL

20:19.261 --> 20:22.003
OUR LIFEGUARD DEPARTMENT
IS. AS YOU KNOW,

20:22.960 --> 20:25.398
OURS IS A SIMPLE
PROBLEM OF ECONOMICS.

20:25.528 --> 20:28.966
-I UNDERSTAND, BUT CLOSING
BEACHES AND REDUCING SERVICES

20:29.097 --> 20:31.099
COULD COST MORE MONEY
IN THE LONG RUN.

20:32.056 --> 20:34.102
WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT
OUR LIFEGUARD DEPARTMENT

20:34.233 --> 20:36.844
JUST COMPRISES ONE
TENTH OF ONE PERCENT

20:36.974 --> 20:39.325
OF THE COUNTY BUDGET,
IT'S EASY TO SEE

20:39.455 --> 20:43.285
THAT JUST ONE LIABILITY LAWSUIT
DUE TO PERSONNEL CUTBACKS

20:43.938 --> 20:45.896
COULD NEGATE ANY
POTENTIAL SAVINGS.

20:46.027 --> 20:47.724
-MAY I SAY SOMETHING?

20:47.855 --> 20:52.599
-ABSOLUTELY, THIS IS SENIOR
OCEAN LIFEGUARD C.J. PARKER.

20:52.729 --> 20:55.428
-THAT'S RIGHT, I'M A LIFEGUARD.

20:55.558 --> 20:58.213
ALL OF US HERE IN
RED ARE LIFEGUARDS.

20:58.735 --> 21:01.912
LIFE GUARDS, THINK ABOUT IT.

21:03.566 --> 21:05.568
MOST PEOPLE DON'T
TRUST ANYONE THESE DAYS

21:05.699 --> 21:07.309
BUT THEY COME TO THE
BEACH AND THEY TRUST US

21:07.440 --> 21:10.747
WITH THE MOST IMPORTANT
THING THEY HAVE, THEIR LIVES.

21:11.313 --> 21:14.882
AND IF WE'RE NOT HERE TO PROTECT
THEM, LIVES WILL BE LOST.

21:15.970 --> 21:18.799
SIMPLE ECONOMICS?
I DON'T THINK SO.

21:20.931 --> 21:24.108
-AS YOU CAN SEE WE'RE ALL VERY
PASSIONATE ABOUT WHAT WE DO.

21:24.892 --> 21:27.808
PASSION IS ONE THING,
STATISTICS ARE ANOTHER.

21:30.593 --> 21:34.031
OVER THE LAST 15 YEARS
160,000 LIVES WERE SAVED

21:34.162 --> 21:37.905
BY LIFEGUARDS, 160,000 LIVES.

21:38.035 --> 21:41.387
THAT IS THE POPULATION
OF A GOOD SIZED CITY.

21:42.562 --> 21:46.043
AND LIKE MOST CITIES, RESCUE
CITY IS MADE UP OF INDIVIDUALS,

21:46.653 --> 21:50.744
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE
HOPES, DREAMS, FAMILIES,

21:51.571 --> 21:53.616
LIVES THAT TOUCH OTHER LIVES.

21:54.356 --> 21:56.793
PEOPLE WHO WILL BE MISSED
BY OTHERS IF THEY'RE GONE.

21:58.360 --> 21:59.579
SOME OF THESE PEOPLE
ARE HERE TODAY.

22:00.754 --> 22:02.973
SOME OF THESE PEOPLE
ARE HERE TODAY BECAUSE

22:03.104 --> 22:05.541
LIFEGUARDS WERE THERE
WHEN THEY NEEDED THEM.

22:08.892 --> 22:10.241
-MY NAME IS DAVID LINDEMANN,

22:10.372 --> 22:12.940
AND THIS IS MY
FIANCE, JULIA WARD.

22:15.290 --> 22:18.554
-WE'RE ALIVE BECAUSE
TWO WONDERFUL LIFEGUARDS

22:18.685 --> 22:20.077
WERE AT THE BEACH LAST WEEK.

22:20.208 --> 22:21.688
-DAVID: WHEN
THEY WERE OFF-DUTY.

22:21.818 --> 22:25.300
-WE DIDN'T NOTICE THE
BEACH CLOSED SIGNS.

22:25.431 --> 22:28.956
I MEAN, WHO EXPECTS A
BEACH TO BE CLOSED.

22:42.752 --> 22:45.929
-I'M GOVERNOR GEORGE DICKSON,
BUT I'M NOT HERE TODAY

22:46.060 --> 22:49.193
AS A FORMER GOVERNOR,
I'M HERE AS A PERSON

22:49.324 --> 22:55.069
WHOSE LIFE WAS SAVED BY THE
HEROIC ACTIONS OF LIFEGUARDS,

22:55.199 --> 22:59.334
WHO PUT THEIR OWN LIVES AT
RISK TO SAVE MINE AND THE LIVES

22:59.465 --> 23:01.554
OF THOUSANDS OF OTHER
PEOPLE WHO WERE ON THE PIER

23:01.684 --> 23:04.034
LISTENING TO ME SPEAK
ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT.

23:04.818 --> 23:07.647
NOW THIS WAS NOT AN
ACCIDENTAL DROWNING,

23:08.474 --> 23:10.171
THIS WAS AN
ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT.

23:12.173 --> 23:16.046
WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO ABUSE
OUR NATURAL RESOURCES,

23:16.177 --> 23:19.049
BUT THE TURNAROUND DOES
NOT BEGIN IN WASHINGTON.

23:19.180 --> 23:21.574
-[BEEPING]

23:21.704 --> 23:26.100
-[ROCK MUSIC]

23:41.507 --> 23:42.725
-THEY GOT THIS
THING ON AUTO-PILOT.

23:44.423 --> 23:47.338
LOOKS LIKE EVERYTHING'S
WIRED, STEERING, THROTTLE,

23:47.948 --> 23:49.253
TOUCH THE WRONG
WIRE WE'RE HISTORY.

23:50.254 --> 23:51.560
-LOOK OUT, MITCH!

23:55.999 --> 23:57.914
-MAYBE I CAN TURN
THE ENGINE BY HAND.

23:58.045 --> 24:01.962
-[ROCK MUSIC]

24:04.094 --> 24:08.229
-[APPLAUSE]

24:12.407 --> 24:16.455
-THE TURNAROUND DOES NOT BEGIN
IN WASHINGTON, OR IN TOKYO.

24:58.758 --> 25:00.803
I'D HATE TO THINK WHAT
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED

25:00.934 --> 25:04.415
IF THESE LIFEGUARDS HAD
NOT HAD THE WAVE RUNNERS

25:04.546 --> 25:07.375
AND THE BOATS THAT PROPOSED
BUDGET CUTBACKS WOULD ELIMINATE.

25:09.203 --> 25:12.293
OUR BEACHES ARE ONE OF THE
GREATEST TOURIST ATTRACTIONS

25:12.423 --> 25:15.296
IN THE STATE. JUST
IMAGINE THE IMPACT

25:16.079 --> 25:19.605
IF PEOPLE STARTED TO DIE
BECAUSE THE BEACHES WERE UNSAFE.

25:28.657 --> 25:30.093
-MY NAME IS CHARLIE DUPREE.

25:31.181 --> 25:33.401
ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO I
WAS HOMELESS AND LIVING

25:33.532 --> 25:34.881
IN A CONDEMNED BUILDING
HERE AT THE BEACH.

25:36.056 --> 25:37.492
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
I'D HAVE ENDED UP

25:37.623 --> 25:40.364
IF I DIDN'T MEET HOBIE.
HIS FATHER'S A LIFEGUARD.

25:41.235 --> 25:42.410
ALTHOUGH I GUESS
WHERE I PROBABLY

25:42.541 --> 25:43.672
WOULD HAVE ENDED UP IS DEAD.

25:45.369 --> 25:47.023
-[SCREAMING]

25:48.372 --> 25:51.941
[SCREAMING] HELP!

26:27.411 --> 26:29.283
-[GASPING]

26:29.413 --> 26:30.458
-IT'S OKAY.

26:32.503 --> 26:33.548
I GOT YA.

26:43.427 --> 26:44.733
SHE'S ALL RIGHT.

26:52.915 --> 26:55.352
-I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT
I'M NOT HOMELESS ANYMORE.

26:55.483 --> 26:57.093
THE LIFEGUARDS HELPED
MY MOTHER FIND A JOB

26:57.224 --> 26:58.312
AND I'M GOING TO SCHOOL NOW.

26:59.530 --> 27:00.923
AND I REALLY HOPE YOU
DON'T TAKE AWAY THE MONEY

27:01.054 --> 27:03.143
THE LIFEGUARDS NEED TO
SAVE KIDS FROM DROWNING,

27:03.273 --> 27:05.101
AND I DON'T JUST
MEAN IN THE WATER.

27:06.537 --> 27:09.149
-MY SON DID DROWN IN THE WATER.

27:13.153 --> 27:15.285
HE WAS PULLED FROM
SHORE BY A RIP TIDE

27:15.416 --> 27:17.897
THAT DRAGGED HIM AND
HIS BROTHER OUT TO SEA.

27:18.593 --> 27:20.769
HE WAS SUBMERGED FOR
OVER THREE MINUTES.

27:34.740 --> 27:36.002
-THEY FOUND HIM.

27:36.132 --> 27:37.264
THEY'VE GOT HIM.

27:37.394 --> 27:38.308
-IS HE ALL RIGHT?

27:47.796 --> 27:49.798
-MITCH: ONE, TWO,
THREE, FOUR, FIVE.

27:49.929 --> 27:50.799
-C.J.: THERE'S NO RESPIRATION.

27:50.930 --> 27:51.800
-NO PULSE.

27:51.931 --> 27:53.062
-WHERE'S THE AMBU BAG?

27:55.238 --> 27:56.326
-COME ON BOBBY.

27:56.457 --> 27:58.546
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE.

27:58.677 --> 28:01.636
TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE.
-PATIENT'S APPROXIMATELY
A TEN YEAR OLD MALE.

28:01.767 --> 28:03.464
HE'S 90-95 POUNDS.

28:03.594 --> 28:06.119
NO RESPIRATION AND
WE'VE STARTED CPR.

28:36.627 --> 28:39.979
-MY SON WAS PRONOUNCED DEAD,

28:40.109 --> 28:42.503
BUT THE LIFEGUARDS, THEY JUST...

28:43.460 --> 28:44.592
THEY WOULDN'T ACCEPT IT.

28:45.419 --> 28:46.899
THEY BROUGHT HIM BACK TO LIFE.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.904
I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE
THE DEPTH OF PAIN

28:52.034 --> 28:54.950
MY FAMILY WOULD HAVE SUFFERED
IF THEY HADN'T BEEN THERE.

28:59.868 --> 29:03.176
-IN THE HOSPITAL, WHEN I
WOKE UP, THERE WAS A MARBLE

29:03.306 --> 29:05.178
IN MY HAND THAT MITCH
GAVE ME FOR GOOD LUCK.

29:06.179 --> 29:08.355
YOU HOLD IT WHEN YOU WANT
SOMETHING REALLY BAD.

29:09.225 --> 29:11.445
PLEASE DON'T MAKE IT SO
KIDS CAN'T COME TO THE BEACH

29:11.575 --> 29:13.534
WITHOUT SOMEBODY THERE
TO MAKE IT SAFE FOR THEM.

29:14.622 --> 29:16.624
I STILL THINK THE BEACH
IS THE BEST PLACE.

29:17.756 --> 29:18.626
THANK YOU.

29:28.375 --> 29:30.203
-IT'S THE MIDDLE OF THE
NIGHT IN FEBRUARY.

29:30.333 --> 29:34.468
THE WATER WAS FREEZING, A
FISHERMAN REPORTS A LADY

29:34.598 --> 29:35.948
+IN THE WATER OFF THE PIER.

29:37.427 --> 29:39.952
TIME FOR A WETSUIT?
YEAH RIGHT.

29:41.518 --> 29:43.390
I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE
TIME TO THINK.

29:44.870 --> 29:47.524
IT WAS OFF THE END OF
THE PIER AND GRAB HER

29:47.655 --> 29:49.352
BEFORE SHE SANK TO THE BOTTOM.

29:50.919 --> 29:53.400
WE STARTED CPR AND WE
MANAGED TO BRING HER BACK.

29:55.141 --> 29:57.796
I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY
GAVE ME A COMMENDATION.

30:00.537 --> 30:02.409
I WAS JUST DOING MY JOB.

30:04.759 --> 30:05.716
THANK YOU.

30:11.157 --> 30:12.767
-MY NAME IS MEMO URUETA.

30:13.637 --> 30:16.989
I USED TO BE IN A GANG.
WE'D COME DOWN THE BEACH

30:17.119 --> 30:18.599
AND GET AWAY WITH
WHATEVER WE COULD

30:18.729 --> 30:20.601
UNTIL THE LIFEGUARDS
HERE STOPPED US.

30:23.256 --> 30:24.344
MY BEACH, FLACO.

30:27.303 --> 30:28.522
-DON'T SEE NO SIGNS.

30:31.394 --> 30:33.875
-1016, GANG BANGERS ON
THE BEACH, GIVE ME BACKUP.

30:34.006 --> 30:36.138
-WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
CUT THOSE SIGNS DOWN.

30:38.097 --> 30:39.620
-THEN THEY GAVE US A CHOICE,

30:40.360 --> 30:43.189
JAIL OR SOMETHING CALLED
THE WATER PROGRAM.

30:44.103 --> 30:47.889
IT STANDS FOR
WATER AWARENESS TRAINING
EDUCATION AND RECRUITMENT.

30:48.672 --> 30:50.718
IT'S SO INNER-CITY KIDS
WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO LEARN

30:50.849 --> 30:53.590
ABOUT THE BEACH AND
GAIN SOME SELF RESPECT.

30:53.721 --> 30:57.029
LET ME TELL YOU. IT'S
HARD, BUT IT WORKS.

30:58.595 --> 31:01.860

-MIJO, MIJO.

31:35.328 --> 31:37.721
-LIFEGUARDS SAVED MY BUTT.

31:38.940 --> 31:40.855
THERE'S NO WAY I'D BE ALIVE
RIGHT NOW WITHOUT THEM

31:40.986 --> 31:42.335
PULLING ME OUT OF
THE MESS I WAS IN.

31:43.162 --> 31:46.905
NO WAY I'D BE BACK IN SCHOOL,
WITH A FUTURE AHEAD OF ME.

31:48.254 --> 31:50.821
FOR EVERY DOLLAR YOU
PUT INTO THESE PROGRAMS,

31:50.952 --> 31:53.302
YOU'LL SAVE TWO FIGHTING
CRIME ON THE STREETS.

31:57.393 --> 32:00.657
-TAKE TOP LEVEL ATHLETES, AND
TRAIN THEM IN EVERYTHING FROM

32:00.788 --> 32:04.835
SCUBA TO BOAT OPERATIONS TO
CLIFF RESCUES TO PARAMEDICS,

32:04.966 --> 32:07.360
AND YOU HAVE LIFEGUARDS
WHO CAN EFFECTIVELY DEAL

32:07.490 --> 32:11.059
WITH DROWNINGS, PLANE
CRASHES, SWIFT WATER RESCUES,

32:11.190 --> 32:14.933
DIVING EMERGENCIES, HEART
ATTACKS, BOAT FIRES.

32:39.087 --> 32:40.088

32:40.219 --> 32:42.482

GO AFTER THE GIRL.

YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

33:57.644 --> 33:59.646
-IT'S SCARY WHEN
YOU'RE DROWNING.

33:59.776 --> 34:02.431
YOU CAN'T BREATHE, AND YOU
CAN'T GET BACK UP TO THE AIR.

-MY HUSBAND AND I
DON'T HAVE MUCH MONEY,

34:07.915 --> 34:10.699
BUT WE WOULD BE MORE THAN
WILLING TO PAY OUR SHARE

34:10.831 --> 34:13.181
TO MAKE SURE THERE ARE ENOUGH
LIFEGUARDS ON THE BEACH.

34:14.268 --> 34:17.925
WE'D FIND THE MONEY SOMEWHERE,
THAT IS IF YOU CAN'T.

-MY NAME IS MORGAN HOOPER,

34:30.677 --> 34:31.808
AND THIS IS MITCHELL.

34:32.722 --> 34:34.768
HE WAS NAMED AFTER THE
LIFEGUARD WHO RESCUED ME

34:34.898 --> 34:38.032
OFF SOME ROCKS THAT I WAS
STUCK ON WHEN THE TIDE CAME IN.

34:44.299 --> 34:45.387
-ALL RIGHT.

34:50.652 --> 34:52.045
GO ON. GO, GO.

34:58.096 --> 34:59.445
-MITCH LOOK OUT, A WAVE.

34:59.575 --> 35:00.446
MITCH LOOK OUT!

35:05.929 --> 35:07.017
-MITCH!

35:07.148 --> 35:09.150
NORMAN, MITCH IS IN TROUBLE.

35:21.858 --> 35:23.121
MITCH!

35:26.689 --> 35:29.257
I'VE GOT YOU. I GOT YOU.

35:29.388 --> 35:30.563
YOU'LL BE OKAY.

35:30.693 --> 35:32.913
-I CAN'T-- I CAN'T MOVE MY LEGS.

35:34.958 --> 35:35.916
-HOLD ON.

35:42.357 --> 35:44.490
DON'T LIFT HIS LEGS!
BE CAREFUL OF HIS LEGS.

35:44.620 --> 35:46.100
-OKAY, HOLD HIM.
I'LL GET THE BACKBOARD.

35:46.231 --> 35:47.623
-ALL RIGHT, JUST
KEEP ON HIS HEAD.

35:48.842 --> 35:50.017
JUST KEEP ON HIS HEAD.

35:53.281 --> 35:54.804
-OKAY, OKAY.

35:54.935 --> 35:57.111
-OKAY, REAL GOOD.
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU
ON A BACKBOARD.

36:02.029 --> 36:03.422
-EASY, EASY.

36:10.907 --> 36:11.865
EASY, EASY.

36:11.995 --> 36:12.953
-STEPHANIE: OKAY MITCH.

36:18.959 --> 36:20.656
-THIS MAN RISKED
HIS LIFE FOR ME.

36:21.875 --> 36:23.964
HE WAS ALMOST
PERMANENTLY PARALYZED.

36:24.094 --> 36:26.749
IF IT WASN'T FOR HIM AND
THE OTHER LIFEGUARDS,

36:27.446 --> 36:28.838
MY BABY WOULDN'T BE HERE.

36:29.752 --> 36:30.927
-HEY, BUDDY.

36:31.058 --> 36:32.755
HEY, LITTLE MITCHELL.

36:32.886 --> 36:35.541
IF THESE PEOPLE ARE WILLING
TO SACRIFICE THEIR LIVES,

36:35.671 --> 36:37.934
I THINK WE SHOULD SACRIFICE
WHATEVER WE HAVE TO

36:38.065 --> 36:39.980
SO THAT THEY CAN
GET THEIR JOBS DONE.

36:44.680 --> 36:46.726
-WELL, I THINK IT'S ABOUT
TIME THAT WE WRAPPED THIS UP.

36:48.423 --> 36:49.685
I KNOW IT'S GETTING
HOT OUT AND WE'VE

36:49.816 --> 36:50.991
HIT YOU OVER THE
HEAD PRETTY HARD.

36:51.818 --> 36:54.516
BUT BEFORE YOU GO WE'D
LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR,

36:54.647 --> 36:57.084
WELL, FOR GIVING US AN
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A REUNION

36:57.215 --> 36:59.129
WITH SOME OF THE PEOPLE
WHOSE LIVES WE'VE TOUCHED.

37:00.392 --> 37:01.958
WOULD EVERYONE WHO WAS
RESCUED BY A LIFEGUARD

37:02.089 --> 37:04.744
PLEASE STAND BY THE
LIFEGUARD WHO SAVED YOU.

37:32.685 --> 37:33.729
-EXCUSE ME.

37:36.210 --> 37:38.734
I GUESS THE BOTTOM
LINE HERE IS THAT

37:38.865 --> 37:42.260
WITH LIFEGUARDS ON THE
BEACH, PEOPLE WILL LIVE.

37:43.435 --> 37:45.785
WITHOUT THEM, PEOPLE WILL DIE.

37:48.570 --> 37:49.919
THANKS FOR COMING.

38:09.939 --> 38:11.071
-WELL?

38:13.073 --> 38:14.988
-LET'S OPEN IT TOGETHER, HUH?

38:34.660 --> 38:35.835
-OH, THEY CUT CAPTAINS.

38:35.965 --> 38:37.489
-YEAH, YEAH BUT
THEY'VE INCREASED

38:37.619 --> 38:40.318
LIEUTENANTS, DIVE
TEAMS, RESCUE BOATS.

38:40.448 --> 38:41.754
-I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

38:41.884 --> 38:42.842
-LOOK AT THIS NUMBER.

38:44.104 --> 38:46.759
THERE ARE MORE
INCREASES THAN CUTS.

38:46.889 --> 38:48.326
-WHERE'D THEY GET THE MONEY?

38:51.198 --> 38:52.460
-PROPOSITION 172,

38:52.591 --> 38:54.854
THEY ALLOCATED FUNDS
FROM PROPOSITION 172,

38:54.984 --> 38:56.116
THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN.

38:56.638 --> 38:57.900

TELL EVERYBODY.
