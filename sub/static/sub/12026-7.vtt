13:13.827 --> 13:16.060
It's all slush right here.

13:17.263 --> 13:19.731
Yeah, it's super soft

13:19.733 --> 13:22.801
So... that's a hole there.

13:29.608 --> 13:33.344
But I'm gonna go across
this ice.

13:36.582 --> 13:39.717

and see where it goes.

13:43.522 --> 13:45.590

13:47.593 --> 13:50.195
All right,
I'm gonna go for it

very careful

This is- Yeah,

25:01.634 --> 25:04.668
This is about as ugly

I don't usually get a chance

When you're working with mud
a good thing to do

Do you think a guy can take

25:35.134 --> 25:38.035
just two singles
on the back axle?

25:40.071 --> 25:43.207
Okay. We're gonna take a shot

25:49.748 --> 25:52.383
The odds of making it up
there are very slim,

25:52.385 --> 25:56.887

we're gonna give her a shot.

25:58.757 --> 26:02.660
Okay, I'm gonna put it
in manual,

I got (bleep) chains on it
and everything else.

41:39.396 --> 41:41.698
Totally (bleep) on flat ground.
