            Hello.

01:34:30.007 --> 01:34:35.110
     I have a brochure
     from a long time ago
     for trips to London.

01:34:35.112 --> 01:34:37.445
   I know they don't cost
   $359 anymore,

01:34:37.447 --> 01:34:42.316
  but could you let me know
  what it would cost?

01:34:43.252 --> 01:34:44.751
              Now?

01:35:20.421 --> 01:35:22.888
           Here I am, Frankie.

01:35:23.123 --> 01:35:25.223
        I finally made it.
