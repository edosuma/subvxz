[music playing]

00:03.818 --> 00:06.055
This is The Premise.

00:06.089 --> 00:09.028
[music playing]

00:12.301 --> 00:13.303
Take two marker.

00:15.274 --> 00:16.276
Quite on the set.

00:19.816 --> 00:21.019
Quiet, guys.

00:36.584 --> 00:40.692
So we don't actually have
this job open at the moment.

00:40.725 --> 00:42.228
I understand that.

00:42.261 --> 00:43.764
But we have this on file.

00:43.798 --> 00:47.304
I can be an extremely
effective, passionate advocate

00:47.338 --> 00:49.275
for this cause.

00:49.308 --> 00:51.079
I believe it's my calling.

00:51.112 --> 00:52.749
We really appreciate that.

00:52.782 --> 00:54.452
I was born to do this job.

00:54.485 --> 00:56.456
And I admire that passion.

00:56.489 --> 00:57.424
Again.

00:57.458 --> 01:00.765
I moved here to do this job.

01:00.798 --> 01:03.838
You moved here for
this particular job

01:03.871 --> 01:06.744
that you're applying for, in PR.

01:06.777 --> 01:08.648
Yes ma'am.

01:08.681 --> 01:12.288
Even though you have
no prior PR experience?

01:12.321 --> 01:12.722
Yes ma'am.

01:16.897 --> 01:19.268
Did you look me up?

01:19.302 --> 01:22.141
Just look up my name.

01:24.445 --> 01:24.846
OK.

01:34.365 --> 01:36.102
I see.

01:36.135 --> 01:41.346
I see, I am so sorry.

01:41.379 --> 01:43.216
Could you excuse me
for just one moment.

01:43.249 --> 01:46.222
I will be right back.

01:46.255 --> 01:46.690
Thank you.

01:46.790 --> 01:47.324
Thank you.

01:53.303 --> 01:53.838
Welcome aboard.

01:53.871 --> 01:57.344
[music playing]

02:02.254 --> 02:03.624
Hey, new guy.

02:03.658 --> 02:04.626
Chase right?

02:04.660 --> 02:06.296
Figured you could use a friend.

02:06.329 --> 02:08.366
Aaron, membership.

02:08.400 --> 02:10.470
You’re the new PR guy, right?

02:10.505 --> 02:13.778
Well it means we're on the same
floor, also self‐appointed tour

02:13.811 --> 02:14.813
guide around here.

02:14.846 --> 02:16.316
Come on let me show you around.

02:16.349 --> 02:18.688
Show you who to avoid,
all the good stuff.

02:18.721 --> 02:20.257
You met all the departments yet?

02:20.290 --> 02:21.593
Not yet.

02:21.627 --> 02:23.864
Been down to the cafeteria,
get yourself a Yoo‐hoo?

02:23.898 --> 02:25.535
Can't say that I have.

02:25.568 --> 02:26.837
Everybody, this is Chase.

02:26.870 --> 02:28.641
He's really great guy.

02:28.674 --> 02:29.776
Look at me.

02:29.810 --> 02:30.945
I'm doing PR for
the PR guy, right?

02:30.978 --> 02:31.847
Taking notes, Chase?

02:31.880 --> 02:33.249
Hey, Marco.

02:33.283 --> 02:34.619
Chase.

02:34.653 --> 02:38.159
I'm sorry I
missed the cookout.

02:38.193 --> 02:39.395
I want you to meet these guys.

02:39.428 --> 02:41.232
Accounting say hi to Chase.

02:41.265 --> 02:42.234
Hey Pamela.

02:42.267 --> 02:43.203
Hey.

02:43.236 --> 02:43.804
Hey, Matt, say hi to Chase.

02:43.838 --> 02:45.207
Hey.

02:45.240 --> 02:45.908
Show the new guy the basement
yet?

02:45.942 --> 02:46.877
We're headed there now.

02:46.910 --> 02:47.645
All right.

02:47.679 --> 02:48.213
Welcome Chase.

03:01.439 --> 03:01.840
Go ahead.

03:10.792 --> 03:11.794
Hey.

03:11.827 --> 03:13.831
What are you up to this weekend?

03:13.864 --> 03:15.635
New CALL TO ACTION'‘s out.

03:15.668 --> 03:17.204
I got it last night.

03:17.237 --> 03:18.507
Beat me to it.

03:18.541 --> 03:21.245
Perfect, I'll come by
tomorrow, let's play.

03:21.279 --> 03:23.316
My place isn't set up yet.

03:23.349 --> 03:24.285
What's there to setup?

03:24.318 --> 03:25.487
You got CALL TO ACTION.

03:25.521 --> 03:27.257
Trust me I got a
family to get away from

03:27.291 --> 03:29.696
and it'll be like staying
at a five star hotel.

03:29.730 --> 03:30.631
I don't know.

03:30.665 --> 03:32.869
Ah, give me a break.

03:32.902 --> 03:34.606
You don't have any friends.

03:34.639 --> 03:37.277
You definitely don't have
anything to do on the weekend.

03:37.311 --> 03:38.881
Me, I'm coming over
tomorrow and you,

03:38.914 --> 03:41.352
you're going to play video
games with some guy at work

03:41.385 --> 03:43.758
like a single lonely guy at a
new job is supposed to.

03:46.396 --> 03:46.864
See you there.

03:51.740 --> 03:54.278
Dude, this game's been
out like one day.

03:54.311 --> 03:55.982
It's pretty much the
same as the last one.

03:56.015 --> 03:57.652
Yeah, how much you
play the last one?

04:02.796 --> 04:06.469
You know, dude your apartment's
kind of like crazy sad.

04:08.874 --> 04:11.547
But that's just
because you lost.

04:11.580 --> 04:14.853
Like 10% for the loss.

04:14.886 --> 04:16.790
Let's go.

04:16.824 --> 04:17.391
Boom.

04:22.702 --> 04:24.739
Yeah, I've been here 10 years.

04:24.773 --> 04:26.610
First and only job.

04:26.643 --> 04:28.547
Second place I applied.

04:28.581 --> 04:29.983
What was the first?

04:30.016 --> 04:31.920
Well the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, and Firearms,

04:31.954 --> 04:33.991
my three favorite things.

04:34.024 --> 04:37.431
Probably shouldn't have said
that at the interview though.

04:37.464 --> 04:42.407
The NGL though, that
was the big deal for me.

04:42.441 --> 04:43.611
Why is that?

04:43.644 --> 04:45.648
You know, grew up
in a big gun family?

04:45.681 --> 04:47.919
We're all still really close.

04:47.952 --> 04:50.423
My dad would go on these
three week hunting trips,

04:50.457 --> 04:52.327
there's something
primal about that.

04:52.361 --> 04:54.398
Your dad going out
into the woods,

04:54.431 --> 04:57.371
coming back with
food for the family.

04:57.404 --> 04:59.576
You ever had deer jerky?

04:59.609 --> 05:00.845
No.

05:00.878 --> 05:03.449
Let me tell you
something, it's the worst.

05:03.483 --> 05:06.790
There's a reason why people
domesticated cows instead

05:06.824 --> 05:09.361
but he stocked the
pantry up with it.

05:09.395 --> 05:11.700
It sounded cool it
really did and it only

05:11.733 --> 05:15.975
occurred to me as an adult,
wait, that stuff sucked.

05:16.008 --> 05:17.712
If you look up to
your parents, you just

05:17.745 --> 05:19.481
get psyched on what
they're psyched on

05:19.516 --> 05:21.352
without even questioning.

05:21.385 --> 05:23.724
That type of parent bond
nothing can break that.

05:23.757 --> 05:26.997
[music playing]

05:32.775 --> 05:35.781
What's it like to lose a child?

05:44.031 --> 05:49.441
You’re the first
person to ask me that.

05:49.475 --> 05:50.511
No, it's OK.

05:50.545 --> 05:53.817
[music playing]

06:01.399 --> 06:02.134
You know what?

06:02.167 --> 06:03.436
You don't have to answer.

06:03.469 --> 06:07.679
[music playing]

06:07.712 --> 06:09.114
Think that is my answer.

06:09.148 --> 06:12.387
[music playing]

06:15.060 --> 06:19.636
You ever bite into
a bunny, a chocolate

06:19.669 --> 06:21.673
Easter Bunny, when
you were a kid?

06:21.707 --> 06:24.879
[music playing]

06:27.819 --> 06:28.721
I dream of her.

06:31.727 --> 06:41.647
We're together on Easter
and we bite into that bunny

06:41.680 --> 06:42.615
but it's hollow.

06:49.161 --> 06:52.602
I'm not sure that makes
sense but that's wh...

06:52.635 --> 06:54.873
That makes the right
amount of sense.

06:58.212 --> 07:01.452
I'm really glad you are here.

07:01.485 --> 07:03.524
I would give anything
for you not to be here

07:03.557 --> 07:06.897
but people look at you.

07:06.930 --> 07:12.642
They'll listen to you and you
can have a really big impact.

07:12.675 --> 07:15.013
That's the idea, right?

07:15.046 --> 07:16.048
That's why I'm here.

07:24.031 --> 07:26.235
WOMAN: PR is peripheral
to most companies

07:26.658 --> 07:28.396
but it's central to ours.

07:28.429 --> 07:31.970
You know the old saying, the
pen is mightier than the sword.

07:32.003 --> 07:33.272
The sword has
changed quite a bit

07:33.305 --> 07:36.011
since they came
up with that one.

07:36.045 --> 07:36.612
So has the pen.

07:39.651 --> 07:43.225
So give me your best arguments.

07:43.259 --> 07:45.263
First of all, wouldn't
start with anything

07:45.296 --> 07:47.434
that you've already seen
on a bumper sticker.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.273
Guns don't kill people,
people kill people.

07:50.306 --> 07:52.143
No, I'd meet the
other side and I

07:52.177 --> 07:54.147
would do it on their territory.

07:54.181 --> 07:56.185
Let's start with their values.

07:56.218 --> 07:58.589
I'd look them in the
eye and I'd ask them,

07:58.622 --> 08:00.593
Are you at all
concerned with the risk

08:00.626 --> 08:03.199
of an authoritarian
or fascist government?

08:03.232 --> 08:05.570
Or are you really
fine living in a country

08:05.603 --> 08:07.607
where only the police
and only the military

08:07.640 --> 08:09.211
have access to weaponry?

08:09.244 --> 08:11.081
What about mental health?

08:11.115 --> 08:12.650
Do you believe it's
a private matter?

08:12.684 --> 08:15.156
Do you believe that it should
be protected from discrimination

08:15.189 --> 08:17.427
or are you fine and
do you think it's fair

08:17.460 --> 08:20.533
that the government just decide
who is and who is not sane?

08:20.566 --> 08:23.205
And then to give different
rights to different people?

08:23.239 --> 08:24.541
How about police bias?

08:24.574 --> 08:26.178
In the history of this
country have we ever

08:26.211 --> 08:28.149
used drug laws as
an unfair excuse

08:28.182 --> 08:31.555
to disproportionately prosecute
and imprison minorities

08:31.588 --> 08:34.694
and do you think now it's wise
that we add similar laws that

08:34.728 --> 08:37.066
would give the courts the
right to just imprison more

08:37.100 --> 08:38.502
people in the exact same way.

08:38.536 --> 08:40.306
How about factory farming?

08:40.339 --> 08:43.078
Do we trust it enough to remove
the right of the individual

08:43.112 --> 08:45.216
to participate directly
in the food chain?

08:45.249 --> 08:48.489
If these things do concern
you, if they bother you,

08:48.522 --> 08:51.295
you can't possibly argue
for more gun laws."

08:51.328 --> 08:52.230
Yes.

08:52.263 --> 08:54.101
Then I'd make it personal.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.971
I'd ask them, "What
would you do if there

08:56.004 --> 08:58.977
was a threat against
you, against your family?

08:59.010 --> 09:01.348
If you knew for certain that
someone was on their way

09:01.381 --> 09:04.654
to kill you, to kill
your kids, what would you

09:04.688 --> 09:06.658
want more than anything
else in the world?

09:06.692 --> 09:10.466
Would you want another bill
in your state legislature

09:10.500 --> 09:13.672
or would you want
a gun in your hand?

09:13.706 --> 09:14.541
All right.

09:14.574 --> 09:16.345
Here's the hard part.

09:16.378 --> 09:18.082
Can you make the case
for the other side?

09:24.027 --> 09:26.532
The more guns you have, the
more gun deaths you have.

09:26.565 --> 09:28.970
Everywhere in the world it's
a one for one correlation.

09:29.004 --> 09:30.673
The closer a gun is to
your loved one the more

09:30.706 --> 09:32.210
their life is in danger, period.

09:32.243 --> 09:33.512
That is a fact.

09:33.546 --> 09:34.982
You'd think if an object
where that directly

09:35.016 --> 09:36.351
tied to the deaths
of innocent people

09:36.385 --> 09:37.287
that we wouldn't debate it.

09:37.320 --> 09:38.556
You know something?

09:38.589 --> 09:40.426
You'd be half right,
it's not debated.

09:40.459 --> 09:41.695
It's ignored.

09:41.728 --> 09:43.432
And if I argued back
about other causes,

09:43.465 --> 09:45.770
the influence of violence in
mass media, mental health.

09:45.803 --> 09:48.576
I'd say those aren't arguments,
those are distractions.

09:48.609 --> 09:51.315
Proven by the fact that in the
aftermath of a mass shooting,

09:51.348 --> 09:54.020
the people that make those
arguments they never actually

09:54.054 --> 09:55.089
pursue them.

09:55.122 --> 09:56.692
Look I play violent video games.

09:56.725 --> 09:58.429
Am I a threat?

09:58.462 --> 10:00.433
My daughter was taken
from me, so am I

10:00.466 --> 10:03.005
in a sane state of mind?

10:03.038 --> 10:04.541
Great.

10:04.574 --> 10:06.111
Far more people in this country
like ice cream than guns,

10:06.144 --> 10:07.247
correct?

10:07.280 --> 10:09.017
But what if people
used ice cream

10:09.050 --> 10:12.457
to violently kill over 30,000
innocent Americans each year?

10:12.490 --> 10:15.463
I guarantee we’d shut down every
Dairy Queen in the country,

10:15.496 --> 10:16.331
we'd do it overnight.

10:16.365 --> 10:17.166
You know something?

10:17.200 --> 10:18.068
It would be easy.

10:18.102 --> 10:19.204
Why?

10:19.237 --> 10:21.441
There's no National
Ice Cream Lobby.

10:21.475 --> 10:23.412
Here we are at the
NGL itself, right?

10:23.445 --> 10:25.550
The ground zero of
the Second Amendment.

10:25.583 --> 10:27.387
We have a total
open carry policy

10:27.420 --> 10:28.589
throughout this building.

10:28.622 --> 10:30.293
We have armed guards
at the front door.

10:30.326 --> 10:32.063
There is a gun range
in the basement.

10:32.096 --> 10:33.666
If we believe our
own hype, we're

10:33.699 --> 10:35.603
in the safest place
on Earth, right?

10:35.636 --> 10:38.042
What's to stop a madman?

10:38.075 --> 10:41.415
Someone determined in making a
statement, someone with nothing

10:41.448 --> 10:44.087
to lose, to infiltrate
this office

10:44.120 --> 10:46.058
and just shoot up the place.

10:46.091 --> 10:47.493
Think about it.

10:47.527 --> 10:49.698
Take out the headquarters
and the entire enterprise

10:49.731 --> 10:51.501
goes crumbling.

10:51.535 --> 10:53.472
You’re just one determined
person away aren't you?

10:59.651 --> 11:02.323
So, how'd I do?

11:02.357 --> 11:03.292
Do you have any notes?

11:06.498 --> 11:07.333
No, it was great.

11:10.606 --> 11:11.208
Morning.

11:21.662 --> 11:22.230
WOMAN: All right.

11:39.698 --> 11:40.333
Lost?

11:45.309 --> 11:46.478
Just exercises.

11:51.455 --> 11:54.794
She's kind of cute.

11:54.828 --> 11:57.433
Yeah "kind of" is generous.

11:57.467 --> 11:59.137
What about her?

11:59.170 --> 12:00.539
What a ten world, no sevens.

12:05.783 --> 12:08.689
You got any friends down
here I mean besides?

12:08.722 --> 12:09.324
Besides who.

12:12.263 --> 12:14.434
Oh.

12:14.467 --> 12:15.670
No Aaron.

12:15.703 --> 12:16.538
Just you.

12:16.571 --> 12:18.910
Yo.

12:18.943 --> 12:20.646
I got something really
weird to ask you.

12:20.680 --> 12:23.385
You just tell me
shut up if you want.

12:23.419 --> 12:23.920
OK?

12:23.953 --> 12:25.456
OK.

12:25.489 --> 12:29.197
Have you ever been on
a hot air balloon ride?

12:29.230 --> 12:30.399
What?

12:30.433 --> 12:31.735
Was that like your line?

12:31.768 --> 12:33.605
Is that what you say at a bar,
have you ever been

12:33.639 --> 12:35.443
on a hot air balloon ride?

12:35.476 --> 12:38.415
I mean, don't get me wrong,
it's kind of working.

12:38.449 --> 12:41.288
So look my birthday's
coming up, 35.

12:41.321 --> 12:43.592
My wife said she wanted me
to get a new experience,

12:43.625 --> 12:45.696
so I said, OK, how
about threesomes?

12:45.730 --> 12:47.935
She said "“Ha‐ha, never in
a million years."

12:47.968 --> 12:50.740
I said "Ha‐ha, I'm glad you
knew that was a joke."

12:50.773 --> 12:52.210
So my second choice.

12:52.243 --> 12:54.614
I wanted to go on a
hot air balloon ride.

12:54.647 --> 12:57.186
She said I'm claustrophobic
and afraid of heights,

12:57.220 --> 12:59.557
I'd rather do the threesome, so.

12:59.591 --> 13:01.628
I don't know why I'm so
embarrassed to ask you‐‐

13:01.661 --> 13:04.801
I would totally love to fuck
you and your wife and I would‐‐

13:07.540 --> 13:08.409
God no.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.837
How about this, man?

13:22.870 --> 13:24.708
Please try to avoid
sudden shifts in weight.

13:24.741 --> 13:25.342
Sorry.

13:35.429 --> 13:37.935
Stop it.

13:37.968 --> 13:41.341
See the river down there?

13:41.374 --> 13:41.909
Hey.

13:41.943 --> 13:44.481
Knock it off.

13:44.514 --> 13:45.850
I've got something to live for.

14:20.987 --> 14:21.956
Hey.

14:21.989 --> 14:23.960
Hi.

14:23.993 --> 14:25.964
I have something I
want to run by you.

14:25.997 --> 14:27.366
OK.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.370
It's sensitive
because it's personal

14:29.404 --> 14:32.543
and it's using your life story.

14:32.577 --> 14:34.848
It's why I'm here, right?

14:34.882 --> 14:39.959
The anniversary is coming up
of your daughter's school.

14:39.992 --> 14:41.561
15th.

14:41.595 --> 14:43.599
There's going to be a
national moment of silence

14:43.632 --> 14:46.471
that morning, as
there should be,

14:46.505 --> 14:51.949
and I was wondering if you would
feel comfortable leading it?

14:55.356 --> 14:56.993
We would set up a
live feed of you

14:57.026 --> 15:00.065
here at your desk during
the moment of silence

15:00.099 --> 15:01.268
as a statement.

15:05.042 --> 15:06.578
As a statement.

15:06.611 --> 15:10.019
I think it'd be
quite a statement.

15:10.052 --> 15:11.721
I do too.

15:11.755 --> 15:14.895
I mean only if
you're comfortable.

15:14.929 --> 15:17.968
I'm comfortable.

15:18.001 --> 15:18.602
Great.

15:57.413 --> 15:58.348
AARON: Why are you so ticklish?

16:03.058 --> 16:04.027
Heard you like to shoot?

16:16.451 --> 16:18.655
These weapons have been in
our family for a long time.

16:22.863 --> 16:26.838
You know, Aaron told me
about your background,

16:26.871 --> 16:28.408
about what happened.

16:28.442 --> 16:32.550
And I can't even express
to you how sorry I am.

16:32.583 --> 16:33.652
He's been a good friend.

16:36.893 --> 16:39.097
So what do you usually
like to shoot with?

16:39.130 --> 16:40.666
AR‐15.

16:40.699 --> 16:43.005
Oh, that's quite a weapon.

16:43.038 --> 16:46.678
I have a personal
connection with it.

16:50.653 --> 16:52.590
And a 60 rounds sure
fire mag with that

16:52.623 --> 16:55.596
it is absolutely unbeatable.

16:55.629 --> 16:57.867
60 round.

16:57.901 --> 17:00.572
Is there an issue with that sir?

17:00.606 --> 17:02.043
It's constitutionally
guaranteed.

17:02.076 --> 17:04.113
Oh, sure, you don't
have to tell me that.

17:04.147 --> 17:07.453
It's like aluminum
bats in baseball to me,

17:07.486 --> 17:09.624
I guess, for the sport.

17:09.657 --> 17:10.894
I'm something of a purist.

17:10.927 --> 17:20.613
Oh, uh, had this one since I was
13. My father took me on a trip.

17:20.646 --> 17:24.520
Aaron tells me you're
a monster on the range.

17:24.554 --> 17:25.924
You shoot competitively
for sport?

17:25.957 --> 17:28.629
I do not.

17:28.662 --> 17:30.866
You've been doing
this your whole life, huh?

17:30.900 --> 17:32.536
Since last September.

17:32.570 --> 17:33.538
Last September?

17:33.572 --> 17:34.540
That's right.

17:34.574 --> 17:36.511
That's not even a year ago.

17:36.544 --> 17:39.183
Must be training
for something.

17:39.217 --> 17:40.887
Usually when someone
gets that good

17:40.920 --> 17:43.492
that fast they're training
for something, a tournament.

17:47.066 --> 17:50.639
Excuse me, let me take that.

17:50.673 --> 17:51.541
Thanks.

17:51.574 --> 17:52.510
Of course.

17:52.543 --> 17:52.978
Thank you.

17:56.685 --> 18:01.761
You know, after the Vietnam
War, a lot of us who came back

18:01.795 --> 18:05.169
had been through not
necessarily what you

18:05.202 --> 18:07.640
went through but an awful lot.

18:07.673 --> 18:14.554
And when we came back, some
of us were OK, but some of us

18:14.587 --> 18:15.022
were‐‐

18:20.934 --> 18:21.936
There's help out there.

18:29.717 --> 18:33.926
Sir, do you mind if I ask you
a question about your service?

18:36.999 --> 18:38.970
The soldiers in your unit, were
any of them

18:39.003 --> 18:40.974
a five‐year‐old girl?

18:52.263 --> 18:55.102
This guy’s trying to tell
me dinosaurs don't exist.

18:55.135 --> 18:57.974
Who is this?

18:58.008 --> 18:59.277
Really?

18:59.310 --> 19:01.014
This guy beat us?

19:01.047 --> 19:03.986
[inaudible]

19:04.020 --> 19:04.955
What's up?

19:04.988 --> 19:05.890
Can want to talk to you about
your buddy.

19:05.924 --> 19:06.558
OK.

19:18.749 --> 19:21.221
AARON: Why do you always bring
your guns to work?

19:21.254 --> 19:23.258
CHASE: Because I can.

19:23.291 --> 19:24.861
Right.

19:24.895 --> 19:27.233
But you also could just
leave them in your locker.

19:27.266 --> 19:30.873
Like I said, because I can.

19:30.907 --> 19:34.915
It's kind of what this
place is all about, right?

19:34.948 --> 19:37.586
Does it make you feel
uncomfortable Aaron?

19:37.620 --> 19:39.023
Oh no, no.

19:39.056 --> 19:39.892
No?

19:39.925 --> 19:41.327
I asked, you answered.

19:41.361 --> 19:43.632
CALL TO ACTION this weekend?

19:43.665 --> 19:44.033
Sunday.

19:46.939 --> 19:47.773
Monday?

19:47.807 --> 19:49.010
Still good?

19:49.043 --> 19:50.646
How are you feeling about it?

19:50.679 --> 19:54.053
It's all I'm thinking about.

19:54.087 --> 19:55.622
Do you have a sec?

19:55.656 --> 19:56.091
Sure.

20:15.262 --> 20:18.201
Come on.

20:18.235 --> 20:21.976
We've been playing a while,
you want to take a break?

20:22.009 --> 20:22.810
No.

20:22.843 --> 20:23.345
Come on.

20:33.966 --> 20:36.704
Hey.

20:36.738 --> 20:37.339
Moment of silence.

20:41.447 --> 20:46.357
You ever think about how
fucked up this country is?

20:46.391 --> 20:48.328
Loud as it gotten it
was fucking noise.

20:51.401 --> 20:53.906
The most extreme response
that we can come up

20:53.940 --> 21:03.725
with to the most extreme
shit is to be silent, but hey

21:03.758 --> 21:04.928
not for so long, right?

21:08.001 --> 21:09.103
Just for a moment.

21:13.278 --> 21:14.413
Moment of silence.

21:24.300 --> 21:28.441
I don't think you should
come into work tomorrow.

21:28.475 --> 21:32.984
I know that was Trish's plan
but with all due respect, fuck

21:33.018 --> 21:34.988
Trish.

21:35.022 --> 21:37.994
It's not Trish's
plan, it's my plan.

21:47.780 --> 21:49.217
I don't know if
you're prepared‐‐

21:49.250 --> 21:52.022
All I've been doing is
preparing for this, OK?

21:54.327 --> 21:54.928
OK.

21:58.468 --> 22:00.439
I don't think you should
come to work tomorrow.

22:03.111 --> 22:03.745
Why not?

22:11.394 --> 22:16.371
Look, both of us think
the other shouldn't

22:16.404 --> 22:18.475
come into work tomorrow, right?

22:18.508 --> 22:19.410
That's a sign.

22:22.349 --> 22:25.055
Let's both take it off, right?

22:25.088 --> 22:27.059
Come on, I'll plan
a day out for us.

22:27.092 --> 22:29.130
It'll be great.

22:29.163 --> 22:34.540
We head up to the mountains,
get some air and some beer

22:34.573 --> 22:39.250
and some perspective.
I'll pick you up, OK?

22:39.283 --> 22:40.920
No, I got to go to work.

22:40.954 --> 22:42.823
I got to be there for
the moment of silence.

22:48.970 --> 22:52.978
Is there anything you
want to talk about?

22:53.011 --> 22:53.845
Because you can.

22:56.284 --> 22:58.221
I'm your friend, aren’t I?

23:01.861 --> 23:02.262
Yeah.

23:03.264 --> 23:03.832
Yeah?

23:07.406 --> 23:08.976
It's OK.

23:09.010 --> 23:09.877
You're my friend.

23:13.518 --> 23:14.487
Yeah.

23:15.990 --> 23:17.894
Yeah.

23:17.927 --> 23:19.530
Maybe you're right.

23:19.563 --> 23:21.868
Maybe we just go
to the mountains.

23:21.902 --> 23:22.803
Just get out of here.

23:25.876 --> 23:27.880
Yeah.

23:27.914 --> 23:29.250
I could pick you up, all right.

23:29.283 --> 23:31.020
Maybe 9 o'clock?

23:31.054 --> 23:32.156
Sure.

23:32.189 --> 23:34.460
I drive, you pack up.

23:34.493 --> 23:37.032
Beer, lots of beer.

23:37.066 --> 23:37.967
OK.

23:38.068 --> 23:38.501
OK.

23:44.447 --> 23:45.148
Don't be late.

24:38.521 --> 24:40.192
Hey.

24:40.225 --> 24:42.129
I thought we were going to
go head up to the mountains?

24:42.162 --> 24:43.598
Right.

24:43.631 --> 24:44.935
I must have totally forgot.

24:50.312 --> 24:53.251
I guess I packed my
bag and then I forgot.

24:53.284 --> 24:54.387
Right.

24:54.420 --> 24:55.021
I get it.

24:59.096 --> 25:01.334
What'd you pack?

25:01.367 --> 25:04.073
You should still go.

25:04.106 --> 25:04.507
Hey.

25:07.279 --> 25:11.254
Listen, you know I'm
not going anywhere.

25:16.164 --> 25:16.597
OK.

25:20.205 --> 25:20.605
OK.

25:26.150 --> 25:27.653
Can I get you anything
from the kitchen?

25:27.686 --> 25:29.256
No, I'm good.

25:29.290 --> 25:29.925
OK.

25:40.011 --> 25:40.980
Hey, Matt.

25:42.182 --> 25:43.218
(no audible dialogue)

25:48.027 --> 25:48.996
(no audible dialogue)

26:06.297 --> 26:07.332
TRISH: OK, everyone.

26:07.366 --> 26:09.670
We're about to go live.

26:09.703 --> 26:11.407
Remember all eyes are on us.

26:11.440 --> 26:12.442
Silence means silence.

27:20.779 --> 27:21.480
No.

27:21.514 --> 27:22.182
Get down.

28:01.427 --> 28:03.097
OK.
