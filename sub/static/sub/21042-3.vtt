00:08.443 --> 00:12.099
NARRATOR: In the future,
you and everyone around you

00:12.142 --> 00:16.190
will exist solely
in a digital universe.

00:16.233 --> 00:20.107
You will open your eyes and live
whatever fantasy you've selected

00:20.150 --> 00:22.761
from an infinite menu
of options.

00:26.113 --> 00:29.942
You will be the hero
of your own story.

00:29.986 --> 00:33.772
Every experience will be
razor-sharp and gorgeous,

00:33.816 --> 00:37.211
like the best smart drug
ever invented.

00:37.254 --> 00:39.517
Say goodbye to all that
brain chemistry

00:39.561 --> 00:42.346
trapping you in the darkness
of your mind.

00:42.390 --> 00:48.309
No more PTSD, no more pain,
no more loss.

00:48.352 --> 00:51.138
Remember that daughter you lost
in a terrible car accident?

00:51.181 --> 00:56.230
Rewind the clock and
imagine a new outcome.

00:56.273 --> 01:02.366
You can have the equivalent
of a digital lobotomy.

01:02.410 --> 01:04.803
Not feeling well?

01:04.847 --> 01:07.937
Just reboot yourself.

01:07.980 --> 01:13.377
This is the future
of your digital existence.

01:13.421 --> 01:21.211
♪

01:21.255 --> 01:24.171
It's the deep future.

01:24.214 --> 01:26.347
Your body, gone.

01:26.390 --> 01:30.351
You're all computer,
all the time.

01:30.394 --> 01:32.396
Your brain is way more powerful

01:32.440 --> 01:36.008
than even a billion
supercomputers.

01:36.052 --> 01:41.362
Jobs, food, language, water,
even traditional thought,

01:41.405 --> 01:45.366
all of humanity's building
blocks, all that's done.

01:45.409 --> 01:48.543
And you are immortal.

01:48.586 --> 01:50.197
Squirming in your chair yet?

01:50.240 --> 01:51.807
You should be.

01:51.850 --> 01:53.417
This isn't science fiction.

01:53.461 --> 01:57.378
Today's visionary thinkers say
it's a strong probability

01:57.421 --> 02:00.511
that this is what your world
is going to look like.

02:00.555 --> 02:04.036
Tonight, they'll guide you
toward that spectacular future,

02:04.080 --> 02:06.430
and we'll see how
one family navigates it,

02:06.474 --> 02:08.954
one invention at a time.

02:08.998 --> 02:12.219
This is the story
of your future.

02:12.262 --> 02:15.004
This is the road
to Year Million.

♪

02:27.451 --> 02:29.888
You might not know it yet,
but pay attention,

02:29.932 --> 02:34.806
because we are on a crash course
to Year Million,

02:34.850 --> 02:37.069
an epoch somewhere
in the deep future

02:37.113 --> 02:38.897
where you can't even
begin to imagine

02:38.941 --> 02:41.465
how technology will utterly
and completely alter

02:41.509 --> 02:45.077
our notion of what
it means to be human.

02:45.121 --> 02:47.471
NEGIN FARSAD: The idea behind
the Year Million

02:47.515 --> 02:48.994
is like a time in the future

02:49.038 --> 02:50.648
where, like, everything
is different.

02:50.692 --> 02:53.216
It's a total paradigm shift.

02:53.260 --> 02:55.218
An idea of this future time,

02:55.262 --> 02:59.309
otherworldly from what
we understand right now.

02:59.353 --> 03:01.268
NARRATOR: I've shown you
how artificial intelligence

03:01.311 --> 03:03.357
is the root of all
future technology.

03:03.400 --> 03:06.055
It will elevate the human race
to a dazzling level

03:06.098 --> 03:10.451
of super-intelligence, and
it will make us all immortal.

03:10.494 --> 03:13.367
Now, we'll launch you
out into the waters

03:13.410 --> 03:15.630
of the largest paradigm shift
for mankind,

03:15.673 --> 03:19.590
where we will live completely
and totally online.

03:19.634 --> 03:21.244
MICHIO KAKU:
After a hard day's work

03:21.288 --> 03:24.639
a lot of people turn on the TV
and they see these worlds,

03:24.682 --> 03:30.427
these imaginary worlds
coming at you like that.

03:30.471 --> 03:32.429
But then afterwards
you turn off the TV

03:32.473 --> 03:34.736
and say, well, that was nice.

03:34.779 --> 03:36.825
It was just a TV program.

03:36.868 --> 03:38.392
Hundreds of years from now,

03:38.435 --> 03:42.091
you will literally leap
into a cyberworld.

03:42.134 --> 03:45.964
You'll be able to touch and feel
the emotions, the fear.

03:46.008 --> 03:49.446
They'll be beamed
right into your brain.

03:49.490 --> 03:51.492
Where you cannot just
play video games,

03:51.535 --> 03:52.710
but all of a sudden,

03:52.754 --> 03:55.496
you are the hero of your,
of your story.

03:55.539 --> 03:57.628
You are the captain of the ship.

03:57.672 --> 04:00.762
NARRATOR: And why does being
the captain of your ship matter?

04:00.805 --> 04:03.547
Allow me a moment to digress.

04:03.591 --> 04:04.853
Perhaps one
of the greatest talents

04:04.896 --> 04:06.333
that we human beings have

04:06.376 --> 04:11.338
is the ability to tell stories,
to dream.

04:11.381 --> 04:14.515
Ever since we invented fire
and huddled around it,

04:14.558 --> 04:16.865
it's how we left
the daily grind behind,

04:16.908 --> 04:20.129
from Shakespeare's stage
to 'Leave it to Beaver.'

04:20.172 --> 04:24.002
The media may change, but
it's still a window on fantasy.

04:24.046 --> 04:27.963
We escape our day, our families,
our fears, even love.

04:28.006 --> 04:29.921
But we need it.

04:29.965 --> 04:32.228
And one day,
we'll have a new choice,

04:32.272 --> 04:35.536
the ultimate chance to escape.

04:35.579 --> 04:38.321
PETER DIAMANDIS: We can digitize
our brain, digitize our persona,

04:38.365 --> 04:40.236
and upload it to the cloud,

04:40.280 --> 04:43.152
where we forget about
our physical body,

04:43.195 --> 04:44.458
but it's really
our consciousness,

04:44.501 --> 04:47.199
our memories, who we are,

04:47.243 --> 04:51.378
and that is resident
on a computational platform

04:51.421 --> 04:54.468
that has infinite
growth potential.

04:54.511 --> 04:56.426
KAKU: We would become the gods

04:56.470 --> 04:59.386
that we once feared
and worshipped.

04:59.429 --> 05:02.563
FARSAD: I mean, could my avatar
just be me

05:02.606 --> 05:05.000
but without all of the anxiety
and insecurity?

05:05.043 --> 05:06.523
Like, I think
that would be great.

05:06.567 --> 05:09.483
She could, like, lose
a few pounds and all that stuff,

05:09.526 --> 05:11.267
you know, typical lady crap.

05:11.311 --> 05:15.010
But I mostly just want her
to, like, sleep better at night

05:15.053 --> 05:16.620
and, like, not worry

05:16.664 --> 05:19.362
that she like offended
the guy at the deli

05:19.406 --> 05:22.278
by like ordering
her coffee weird, you know?

05:22.322 --> 05:23.932
NARRATOR:
That choice to play God,

05:23.975 --> 05:26.630
or just someone who doesn't
tick off a barista,

05:26.674 --> 05:29.503
in some futuristic
microprocessor

05:29.546 --> 05:32.941
is hurtling toward us
faster than you can imagine.

05:32.984 --> 05:35.291
And we are already
smack in the middle

05:35.335 --> 05:38.860
of a soul-rattling,
mind-bending revolution,

05:38.903 --> 05:40.427
where the ultimate destination

05:40.470 --> 05:43.430
will be plugging in
and dropping out.

05:43.473 --> 05:46.955
We're talking about a future
where we are no longer shackled

05:46.998 --> 05:51.176
by all of the fickle quirks
of brain chemistry.

05:51.220 --> 05:55.790
It will be an escape
from reality so pure,

05:55.833 --> 05:58.227
I can't see anyone
not jumping on board

05:58.270 --> 06:01.404
that speeding digital train.

06:01.448 --> 06:07.628
But let me take you through it,
step by digital step.

06:07.671 --> 06:11.588
The first step is
already under way.

06:11.632 --> 06:14.199
Virtual reality is
in its infancy,

06:14.243 --> 06:16.419
but it will soon be so developed

06:16.463 --> 06:18.116
that your sensory nervous system

06:18.160 --> 06:20.902
will believe every touch,
smell, and taste

06:20.945 --> 06:24.340
in the simulated environments
you choose to live in.

06:28.126 --> 06:29.824
That's when you'll be able
to do everything

06:29.867 --> 06:35.656
plugged into a VR universe,
from work to school to play.

06:35.699 --> 06:38.659
That virtual universe is
a new environment on Earth

06:38.702 --> 06:42.140
called the metaverse,
version 1.0.

06:42.184 --> 06:45.709
A new and infinite reality
where you, or your avatar,

06:45.753 --> 06:48.712
can do whatever
your heart desires.

06:48.756 --> 06:52.499
Next there's the metaverse 2.0.

06:52.542 --> 06:54.631
That's when
we'll discard our bodies,

06:54.675 --> 06:57.112
scan our brains into a computer,

06:57.155 --> 07:01.508
and live as a digital signal
in an online cloud collective.

07:01.551 --> 07:04.467
Now don't worry, you'll probably
still have your own identity.

07:04.511 --> 07:09.690
But in metaverse 2.0,
there is no escape hatch.

07:09.733 --> 07:13.650
It's all paradise until
someone's avatar gets deleted.

07:13.694 --> 07:16.087
With a new world
comes new dangers,

07:16.131 --> 07:19.047
and we'll need to control
and police the digital sphere

07:19.090 --> 07:23.355
from a whole host of new crimes.

07:23.399 --> 07:25.706
And here's the thing that'll
really rock your world:

07:25.749 --> 07:29.492
some futurists believe, in fact,
they think the odds prove,

07:29.536 --> 07:33.714
that we are already living
in that simulation.

07:33.757 --> 07:35.411
You heard right.

07:35.455 --> 07:39.415
These are people with PhDs
who are saying this.

07:39.459 --> 07:42.723
Before we begin the adventure,
let's step back in time

07:42.766 --> 07:45.595
and role play
the first time you plug in.

07:53.124 --> 07:54.561
Our future family is taking

07:54.604 --> 07:57.433
a walk in the woods together,
right?

07:57.477 --> 08:00.305
Well, they are,
except their bodies are here

08:00.349 --> 08:02.743
in their living room.

08:02.786 --> 08:07.574
Mom and daughter are big fans
of living in that digital world;

08:07.617 --> 08:11.316
now, if they can
just convince Dad.

08:11.360 --> 08:14.015
OSCAR: So your designers
can recreate anything.

08:14.058 --> 08:16.583
Yet they recreate Earth?

08:16.626 --> 08:17.671
EVA: They create
all kinds of things.

08:17.714 --> 08:19.542
OSCAR: Right. But...

08:19.586 --> 08:21.631
EVA: I thought you'd like to
start with something familiar.

08:21.675 --> 08:25.200
JESS: What do you want
to see, Dad?

08:25.243 --> 08:26.723
NARRATOR:
It seems crazy to believe

08:26.767 --> 08:30.379
we'd ever get a simulation
to look this good.

08:30.422 --> 08:33.774
But remember where we were
nearly 40 years ago

08:33.817 --> 08:37.342
when Atari first transformed
the living room experience.

08:37.386 --> 08:41.564
♪

08:41.608 --> 08:43.697
Well, now think about
how realistic

08:43.740 --> 08:46.656
a PlayStation VR is today.

08:49.616 --> 08:52.401
CHUCK NICE:
I was in fear of my life

08:52.444 --> 08:56.405
that these robot zombies
were going to kill me!

08:56.448 --> 08:57.754
NARRATOR: Exactly.

08:57.798 --> 09:00.801
So, tack on another 40 years

09:00.844 --> 09:03.064
and imagine how much more
amazing it'll look

09:03.107 --> 09:05.501
if you want to digitally
hike the Himalayas

09:05.545 --> 09:08.069
or parachute out
of a virtual airplane

09:08.112 --> 09:11.202
into the Amazon Rain Forest.

09:11.246 --> 09:16.817
Or--and this isn't even in
the future--you could be Batman.

09:16.860 --> 09:19.646
MATT MIRA: I played the Batman
virtual reality game

09:19.689 --> 09:22.823
where you wake up
in Wayne Manor,

09:22.866 --> 09:24.651
you go down to the bat cave,

09:24.694 --> 09:28.524
you put on the bat suit,
and it's great.

09:28.568 --> 09:31.875
It, you feel like you're Batman.

09:31.919 --> 09:34.878
You'll be on the top
of a rooftop in Gotham,

09:34.922 --> 09:38.186
and you look down,
and I swear to God,

09:38.229 --> 09:41.232
sometimes I would feel
a breeze go by me.

09:41.276 --> 09:43.191
Even though I was
in my living room,

09:43.234 --> 09:46.411
like the rest of my body was
being tricked into thinking

09:46.455 --> 09:48.762
I was outside at night
in the rain.

09:48.805 --> 09:50.851
I love it.

09:50.894 --> 09:52.896
NARRATOR: Man, that sounds cool.

09:52.940 --> 09:55.769
But right now,
it's still just a game.

09:55.812 --> 09:57.901
You know you're pretending.

09:57.945 --> 10:02.297
It'd be impossible to sustain
for, say, a lifetime.

10:02.340 --> 10:06.214
But that's only because VR
is in the dark ages

10:06.257 --> 10:08.303
compared to where it will go.

10:08.346 --> 10:12.786
PAUL BETTNER: Today, virtual
reality is a big headset,

10:12.829 --> 10:14.309
it's bulky,

10:14.352 --> 10:18.792
but it will eventually become
an invisible technology.

10:18.835 --> 10:20.097
PHILIP ROSENDALE:
We can definitely get closer

10:20.141 --> 10:22.578
to the retina
with contact lenses.

10:22.622 --> 10:25.537
We should be able to make
ourselves able to see things

10:25.581 --> 10:27.104
we don't see.

10:27.148 --> 10:29.498
Hallucinate visually, basically.

10:31.543 --> 10:32.806
ANDERS SANDBERG:
In the long run,

10:32.849 --> 10:34.155
we want to splice the signal

10:34.198 --> 10:37.941
straight into
our nervous system.

10:37.985 --> 10:40.596
MIRA: You know, all you have
to do is trick five senses.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.773
You don't have to
do anything great.

10:43.817 --> 10:47.255
You just have to trick
your eyes, trick your ears,

10:47.298 --> 10:51.738
trick your nose,
and trick your touch,

10:51.781 --> 10:55.567
and you will be tricked.

10:57.569 --> 11:00.268
NARRATOR: So once VR tricks you,
you won't know the difference

11:00.311 --> 11:02.879
between walking to the bus stop
for real,

11:02.923 --> 11:08.276
or doing it while plugged into
a totally digital landscape.

11:08.319 --> 11:11.758
DAVID BYRNE: It's surprising
to experience things

11:11.801 --> 11:14.369
that aren't there,
that are not real.

11:14.412 --> 11:18.155
You know they're not real,
but you still experience them.

11:18.199 --> 11:19.983
NARRATOR: Our brains
are pretty much

11:20.027 --> 11:22.725
the most sophisticated
instruments on Planet Earth,

11:22.769 --> 11:25.946
so is it possible that
some fancy contact lens

11:25.989 --> 11:28.296
or even a neural implant are
going to make you believe

11:28.339 --> 11:29.732
with every fiber of your being

11:29.776 --> 11:34.781
that you are a Dark Ages knight
or a Mars astronaut?

11:34.824 --> 11:39.002
The question is how will you go
from playing Batman

11:39.046 --> 11:41.918
to being Batman?

11:44.225 --> 11:47.184
This little doll
has your answer.

11:47.228 --> 11:49.752
Visionary artist and
musician David Byrne

11:49.796 --> 11:53.016
is captivated
by the potential of VR.

11:53.060 --> 11:55.758
He's interested in looking
at just how much the technology

11:55.802 --> 11:58.239
can trick our brains.

11:58.282 --> 11:59.762
Can these folks truly believe

11:59.806 --> 12:03.897
that they are this
ugly little doll?

12:03.940 --> 12:05.637
BYRNE: Everybody comes in,

12:05.681 --> 12:08.771
we have this kind of
semicircle of chairs.

12:08.815 --> 12:10.773
A curtain parts in,
in the middle,

12:10.817 --> 12:15.038
and they see a little doll
in a chair.

12:15.082 --> 12:17.954
MAN: Welcome to your new body.

12:17.998 --> 12:19.913
NARRATOR: Yes, I know
you'd rather be a superhero.

12:19.956 --> 12:21.784
But today, you're the doll.

12:21.828 --> 12:23.917
It's all about baby steps,
people.

12:23.960 --> 12:24.961
MAN: We're going to perform

12:25.005 --> 12:27.877
something called an embodiment.

12:27.921 --> 12:31.794
Go ahead and put on the virtual
reality headsets or goggles.

12:31.838 --> 12:36.146
Now I need you to look
down at your legs.

12:36.190 --> 12:42.849
And you should be seeing
your new doll legs.

12:42.892 --> 12:48.419
MAN: Uh, what do you feel
when I touch your knee?

12:48.463 --> 12:50.247
[laughter]

12:50.291 --> 12:53.685
So your eyes tell you
that you are Brita.

12:53.729 --> 12:57.385
Now your sense of touch is
reinforcing this reality.

12:57.428 --> 13:00.692
[laughter]

13:00.736 --> 13:03.217
BYRNE: What you see is
the doll's knee being touched.

13:03.260 --> 13:06.307
But what you feel is your
own knee being touched.

13:06.350 --> 13:07.743
That's when they really feel

13:07.787 --> 13:11.007
like their body
is the doll's body.

13:11.051 --> 13:15.751
Then we kind of culminate by...
[laughs]

13:15.795 --> 13:18.493
by threatening the doll's body
a little bit.

13:18.536 --> 13:20.538
MAN: If you just hold still,
this won't hurt a bit.

13:20.582 --> 13:22.062
Just a little pin prick.

13:22.105 --> 13:24.499
So I'm just gonna
go ahead with that.

13:24.542 --> 13:28.982
Okay.
[laughs]

13:29.025 --> 13:30.070
BETTNER: With the right audio

13:30.113 --> 13:33.073
and the right
visual stimulation,

13:33.116 --> 13:38.861
your brain is willing to fill in
all the rest of the sensations.

13:38.905 --> 13:42.778
The saying 'if you could walk
a mile in someone's shoes,'

13:42.822 --> 13:45.346
that's actually
what you can do now.

13:45.389 --> 13:50.133
NARRATOR: So, yes, it turns out
VR can be extremely persuasive

13:50.177 --> 13:55.660
when it comes to showing you
a simulated world.

13:55.704 --> 13:57.010
ROSEDALE: I would say
that we, as humans,

13:57.053 --> 13:58.750
have already had a great deal
of experience

13:58.794 --> 14:02.667
creating and entering
other worlds.

14:02.711 --> 14:07.107
Our books, shows,
our role-playing,

14:07.150 --> 14:11.285
our everything we do has to some
extent been a creative exercise

14:11.328 --> 14:15.550
in trying to expand the limits
of where we live.

14:15.593 --> 14:17.552
I think that the idea of using
computers to simulate the world

14:17.595 --> 14:20.468
is just kind of the next
logical step in that.

14:20.511 --> 14:22.862
And maybe, as some people
have said, the last one.

14:26.953 --> 14:29.303
NARRATOR: That's right,
the last one.

14:29.346 --> 14:31.783
That's because once we step
into that digital world,

14:31.827 --> 14:35.962
we might never want to leave it.

14:36.005 --> 14:37.702
That could be our future.

14:37.746 --> 14:41.358
It'll be totally normal
to live online all the time,

14:41.402 --> 14:47.408
in a massive planet-wide digital
network known as the metaverse,

14:47.451 --> 14:49.105
where the sky's the limit,

14:49.149 --> 14:54.284
and you can choose your own
adventure every single day.

14:54.328 --> 14:55.459
Better than a cubicle, right?

15:03.337 --> 15:05.643
♪

15:05.687 --> 15:09.169
NARRATOR: The next technological
boom propelling us forward

15:09.212 --> 15:14.217
from virtual reality will mark
an event horizon so dramatic,

15:14.261 --> 15:17.438
that it very well may be
the beginning of the end

15:17.481 --> 15:21.659
of human life
as we've defined it.

15:21.703 --> 15:25.185
I'm not talking end of days;

15:25.228 --> 15:30.625
it's more an evolution
of the human form.

15:30.668 --> 15:33.149
Once we get a taste
of this escapism,

15:33.193 --> 15:35.456
we may never want to come back.

15:35.499 --> 15:38.067
And if you're like me,
you're probably wondering,

15:38.111 --> 15:40.461
can I really be seduced?

15:40.504 --> 15:43.377
And if so,
what will it feel like

15:43.420 --> 15:46.684
to escape into this
shared online world?

15:46.728 --> 15:49.774
Well, try this on for size.

15:49.818 --> 15:51.602
ROSEDALE: If we have
100 billion brain cells,

15:51.646 --> 15:53.996
we have about 100 million or so
of those

15:54.040 --> 15:56.346
that are leading out
to our nerves--

15:56.390 --> 15:59.697
touch, our vision,
smell, everything.

15:59.741 --> 16:04.180
What would it be like to have
100 times more nerves

16:04.224 --> 16:06.182
that were connecting you
to the world around you?

16:06.226 --> 16:09.142
What would it be like
to, to touch someone

16:09.185 --> 16:11.840
with 100 more times
the nerve endings

16:11.883 --> 16:13.363
than you have
in your skin today?

16:13.407 --> 16:15.887
And in a computer,
you could do this.

16:15.931 --> 16:19.152
NARRATOR: The metaverse,
a limitless digital refuge

16:19.195 --> 16:21.806
from our
less-than-perfect world.

16:21.850 --> 16:25.288
Driven by an artificially
intelligent engine.

16:25.332 --> 16:28.857
Once we hook in, we will access
recesses in our brain

16:28.900 --> 16:32.948
we never knew existed, connect
with minds all over the planet,

16:32.992 --> 16:36.169
and collectively rebuild
the world as we envision it,

16:36.212 --> 16:38.998
digital brick by digital brick.

16:41.304 --> 16:44.220
EBBE ALTBERG: The metaverse
connects all humans

16:44.264 --> 16:46.962
in one shared media space.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.442
You can interact
with other people,

16:48.485 --> 16:50.400
like we do
in the physical world.

16:50.444 --> 16:52.620
You can interact
with the environment,

16:52.663 --> 16:55.275
move things, touch things.

16:55.318 --> 16:58.060
SANDBERG: A shared,
joint virtual reality,

16:58.104 --> 16:59.279
that you can move around in,

16:59.322 --> 17:02.978
that most of society
have access to.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.241
KAKU: In the future,
we'll be able to create

17:05.285 --> 17:09.202
an imaginary world
the size of a planet.

17:09.245 --> 17:11.291
BETTNER: I mean, there will be
virtual construction companies

17:11.334 --> 17:13.293
and architects and all these
sorts of crazy jobs,

17:13.336 --> 17:17.079
that would sound ridiculous now
but are completely inevitable.

17:17.123 --> 17:19.212
ROSENDALE: Even in a completely
digital form,

17:19.255 --> 17:21.344
we'll form into tribes
and groups,

17:21.388 --> 17:24.217
and find our people
and fall in love,

17:24.260 --> 17:26.132
and, and do all these things.

17:26.175 --> 17:29.570
But I bet we'll still have
very rich decisions going on

17:29.613 --> 17:32.877
around, you know, how we choose
to live with each other.

17:32.921 --> 17:36.316
And that is still going to be
a very fundamental conflict

17:36.359 --> 17:39.449
that is going to be just as real
inside a digital matter

17:39.493 --> 17:41.756
as it would be
in the real world.

17:41.799 --> 17:44.150
NARRATOR: Ah, yes,
the ever-evolving calculus

17:44.193 --> 17:47.327
of love and relationships
in a world we design.

17:47.370 --> 17:50.112
The temptation could be
unimaginable.

17:53.507 --> 17:56.118
Say you are a woman
in a really long marriage,

17:56.162 --> 17:58.947
what do you do
to add a little spice?

OSCAR: What's a nice girl like
you doing in a place like this?

18:19.750 --> 18:22.536
WOMAN: Exploring my options.

18:22.579 --> 18:26.757
OSCAR: I'm sorry,
but I'm married.

18:26.801 --> 18:28.803
WOMAN: I won't tell
if you won't.

18:32.676 --> 18:35.026
NARRATOR: Now, if this world
makes you uneasy,

18:35.070 --> 18:37.203
you'll still have
an escape hatch--

18:37.246 --> 18:40.423
simply unplug.

18:40.467 --> 18:42.033
But it may not be that simple.

18:42.077 --> 18:47.430
You may feel, well,
more at home in the metaverse.

18:47.474 --> 18:49.302
In fact, there are some
in today's world

18:49.345 --> 18:53.219
who are already spending a lot
of quality time in that bar,

18:53.262 --> 18:57.310
or rather, in this bar.

18:57.353 --> 19:00.443
In virtual clubs on a massive
multiplayer online program

19:00.487 --> 19:03.664
called Second Life.

19:03.707 --> 19:06.797
Second Life attracts
nearly a million patrons

19:06.841 --> 19:11.019
to a digital world,
even without VR.

19:11.062 --> 19:13.326
NICK LOIZIDES: My full name
is Nick Loizides,

19:13.369 --> 19:16.416
and my avatar name is Loz Hyde.

19:16.459 --> 19:20.594
I've been in Second Life
just over 10 years.

19:20.637 --> 19:23.205
NARRATOR: This is a prototype
for the metaverse.

19:23.249 --> 19:26.121
Players live whatever life
they choose.

19:26.165 --> 19:29.559
Living as whatever avatar
they design.

19:29.603 --> 19:31.126
LOIZIDES: When you first log in,

19:31.170 --> 19:33.215
you go through
this metamorphosis

19:33.259 --> 19:36.697
of recreating yourself
into either your likeness

19:36.740 --> 19:40.440
or into something else.

19:40.483 --> 19:44.879
I've seen people
as mermaids or dragons.

19:44.922 --> 19:49.449
Whatever you want to be,
you can be.

19:49.492 --> 19:51.364
NARRATOR: For people like Nick,

19:51.407 --> 19:57.239
Second Life may be just as rich
and nuanced as real life.

19:57.283 --> 19:59.285
LOIZIDES: The people that stick
around and stay in for years

19:59.328 --> 20:00.938
have that moment,

20:00.982 --> 20:03.463
possibly spiritually,
I guess, in some way.

20:03.506 --> 20:04.725
You do something like dance
at the same time,

20:04.768 --> 20:07.118
and that drives another emotion.

20:07.162 --> 20:08.294
And of course,
as you're dancing,

20:08.337 --> 20:10.034
you're not operating anything.

20:10.078 --> 20:12.428
Your avatar is literally
just doing the moves,

20:12.472 --> 20:16.171
and it's very graceful.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.868
NARRATOR:
And how can you blame Nick

20:17.912 --> 20:21.350
when this computer program
can make your average dude,

20:21.394 --> 20:25.267
well, a graceful dancer?

20:25.311 --> 20:26.616
Second Life is a new world

20:26.660 --> 20:29.532
full of experiences
and possibilities.

20:29.576 --> 20:32.100
And that's exactly what
Second Life's creator,

20:32.143 --> 20:34.363
Philip Rosedale,
was looking to do

20:34.407 --> 20:35.886
when he dreamed up the program

20:35.930 --> 20:39.150
as a first step toward
building the metaverse.

20:39.194 --> 20:41.109
Rosedale believes
that the metaverse

20:41.152 --> 20:44.155
could set humanity free.

20:44.199 --> 20:46.549
ROSENDALE:
When Second Life took off,

20:46.593 --> 20:48.682
we saw people are
a good deal more free

20:48.725 --> 20:51.902
about being able
to be themselves.

20:51.946 --> 20:55.123
The dynamics between women
and men inside Second Life

20:55.166 --> 20:57.734
were different than they are
in the real world.

20:57.778 --> 20:59.432
Women took over,

20:59.475 --> 21:03.218
dominated a lot of the economy
and manufacturing,

21:03.262 --> 21:04.785
and I think some of that
comes from the fact

21:04.828 --> 21:08.179
that we had finally
removed all bias.

21:08.223 --> 21:09.877
LOIZIDES: I have a manager
in there, Samantha is her name.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.531
She's amazing.

21:11.574 --> 21:16.318
We have a club called Core,
she basically runs that for me.

21:16.362 --> 21:17.754
Core, the nightclub,
is underwater,

21:17.798 --> 21:21.236
so you have glass around,
you can see fish.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.760
NARRATOR: So the future bar
where Oscar and Eva meet up

21:23.804 --> 21:27.808
for a digital tryst, those kinds
of connections are being forged

21:27.851 --> 21:31.246
right now,
even in today's digital bars.

21:31.290 --> 21:37.252
And those relationships inspire
real emotions, even love.

21:37.296 --> 21:38.601
LOIZIDES: The way I met Sam,
my manager,

21:38.645 --> 21:41.212
I was dancing
with somebody else,

21:41.256 --> 21:42.605
but I was flirting with her.

21:42.649 --> 21:46.000
[laughs]

21:46.043 --> 21:47.697
Whether we meet
in real life or not,

21:47.741 --> 21:49.351
whether I know what she looks
like in real life or not,

21:49.395 --> 21:50.613
it doesn't matter.

21:50.657 --> 21:54.922
I totally trust her
and love her to death.

21:54.965 --> 21:56.402
ANNALEE NEWITZ:
Virtual reality could enhance

21:56.445 --> 21:58.578
a lot of the experiences
that we're already having now

21:58.621 --> 21:59.840
through the Internet

21:59.883 --> 22:01.842
and make them feel
a lot more real,

22:01.885 --> 22:06.716
and give us much more emotional
and visceral reactions.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.501
NARRATOR: Programs like
Second Life

22:08.544 --> 22:10.590
are laying the groundwork
for a metaverse

22:10.633 --> 22:13.070
that will attract
more and more users

22:13.114 --> 22:17.423
until it is as omnipresent
as smart phones.

22:17.466 --> 22:20.774
But Second Life is about to take
a giant step forward.

22:20.817 --> 22:22.602
It's about to morph
into something else,

22:22.645 --> 22:25.648
something that uses
3D virtual reality,

22:25.692 --> 22:28.521
and makes the program
far more immersive,

22:28.564 --> 22:30.436
meaning that
we are getting closer

22:30.479 --> 22:32.742
to being able to experience
the metaverse,

22:32.786 --> 22:36.616
just like
our future family does.

22:36.659 --> 22:39.183
Linden Lab, the company
behind Second Life,

22:39.227 --> 22:43.536
is hard at work on developing
a program called Sansar.

22:43.579 --> 22:46.800
It's Second Life,
but on steroids.

22:46.843 --> 22:48.671
You'll be able to roam around
a digital world,

22:48.715 --> 22:51.544
but now it will be
fully 3D, interactive,

22:51.587 --> 22:53.763
and virtual reality-accessible.

22:53.807 --> 22:56.200
Instead of punching keys
on a keyboard,

22:56.244 --> 22:58.551
it will mimic your movement.

22:58.594 --> 23:00.466
It's realer.

23:00.509 --> 23:02.293
ALTBERG: I put on my headset,

23:02.337 --> 23:04.078
and then I meet
other people there.

23:04.121 --> 23:07.211
And I can have really natural
social interaction with them,

23:07.255 --> 23:09.866
because I can use
my body language.

23:09.910 --> 23:12.565
As my head moves,
my avatar's head moves,

23:12.608 --> 23:14.610
and as I speak, my mouth moves.

23:14.654 --> 23:18.571
Which then makes the way
you communicate with people,

23:18.614 --> 23:20.573
and especially when
you're a group of people,

23:20.616 --> 23:23.837
it sort of becomes
a very natural way

23:23.880 --> 23:26.535
of communicating
with each other.

23:26.579 --> 23:27.928
LOIZIDES: Hey, Bjorn.

23:27.971 --> 23:29.364
BJORN LAURIN:
Hey, Nick, how are you, man?

23:29.408 --> 23:31.061
LOIZIDES:
Good to meet you finally.

23:31.105 --> 23:33.847
NARRATOR: Sansar's VR world
could make the online landscape

23:33.890 --> 23:35.544
even more appealing

23:35.588 --> 23:38.504
for dedicated Second Life
players, like Nick.

23:38.547 --> 23:41.463
LAURIN: Nick, personally I've
only known him for a short time,

23:41.507 --> 23:44.248
basically, but I've kind of
seen him around Second Life.

23:44.292 --> 23:45.685
He applied for Sansar

23:45.728 --> 23:48.122
when we opened up what we call
a creator preview.

23:48.165 --> 23:50.559
We selected him based
on his previous work,

23:50.603 --> 23:52.039
to be part of us now,

23:52.082 --> 23:53.562
basically, one of the early
creators in Sansar,

23:53.606 --> 23:56.913
to work with us.

23:56.957 --> 24:00.395
Let's do some fun and
switch avatars now, basically.

24:00.439 --> 24:03.050
Follow me up here,
up these stairs.

24:03.093 --> 24:04.617
I will show you something fun.

24:04.660 --> 24:07.489
There you go! And then try
to throw it like this.

24:07.533 --> 24:09.709
See, I missed,
I'm really bad apparently.

24:09.752 --> 24:11.319
Nice!

24:11.362 --> 24:14.365
NARRATOR: Once VR makes a bar
that looks real,

24:14.409 --> 24:16.324
is filled with beautiful people,

24:16.367 --> 24:19.632
and always has your favorite
microbrew on tap,

24:19.675 --> 24:24.419
that's when that online world
may just be irresistible.

24:24.463 --> 24:26.508
KAKU: We don't have that
computational power today.

24:26.552 --> 24:29.163
We're not going to have it
100 years from now.

24:29.206 --> 24:32.166
But with quantum computers,
it's a game-changer.

24:32.209 --> 24:34.864
It means that things that
are preposterous today

24:34.908 --> 24:36.910
become possible.

24:36.953 --> 24:39.739
NARRATOR: When we choose to be
hooked up to it all the time,

24:39.782 --> 24:43.569
that will be the birth
of the metaverse 1.0.

24:43.612 --> 24:45.309
BETTNER: But by the time
we get there,

24:45.353 --> 24:48.748
what those experiences will
give us will be so compelling

24:48.791 --> 24:50.619
that, you know,
and then it's there,

24:50.663 --> 24:54.014
and there we're using it,
and there's no going back.

24:54.057 --> 24:57.539
BARATUNDE THURSTON: The Matrix
is coming for all of us.

24:57.583 --> 25:00.455
I don't know that any of us
has a choice.

25:00.499 --> 25:02.022
NARRATOR: That's right,
Baratunde.

25:02.065 --> 25:03.806
We probably don't.

25:03.850 --> 25:05.591
The seductive escape
of the metaverse

25:05.634 --> 25:08.637
is ensnaring us in its web
as we speak,

25:08.681 --> 25:10.770
and you are more
vulnerable to it

25:10.813 --> 25:14.208
every single time you pick up
that smart phone of yours.

25:14.251 --> 25:15.601
But if that makes
you want to throw

25:15.644 --> 25:18.168
every single one
of your screens away,

25:18.212 --> 25:20.780
wait until you hear about
the next incarnation

25:20.823 --> 25:21.563
of the metaverse,

25:21.607 --> 25:23.434
where your body won't even exist

25:23.478 --> 25:26.699
and you'll have transformed
into a post-human,

25:26.742 --> 25:29.092
living entirely
inside the machine.

25:32.052 --> 25:33.488
NARRATOR: It's no secret
that we humans

25:33.532 --> 25:35.621
are pretty obsessed
with how we look.

25:35.664 --> 25:37.448
Look at how many billions
we spend every year

25:37.492 --> 25:40.843
on beauty, fashion,
and exercise.

25:40.887 --> 25:43.019
But what if you didn't
have to be limited

25:43.063 --> 25:46.936
by whatever biology you had
the stupid luck to be born with?

25:46.980 --> 25:48.808
Well, in the future,

25:48.851 --> 25:52.551
we'll be able to escape
the jail of our bodies.

25:54.640 --> 25:55.858
It sounds trippy,

25:55.902 --> 25:58.382
but the metaverse will
eventually graduate

25:58.426 --> 26:03.866
to version 2.0, where we will
abandon our bodies,

26:03.910 --> 26:08.305
upload our minds, and live
permanently on a hard drive.

26:08.349 --> 26:11.439
We're talking about
the ultimate escape.

26:14.094 --> 26:16.792
MIRA: If you're able to digitize
your consciousness

26:16.836 --> 26:20.753
and send it to
a cloud or a body,

26:20.796 --> 26:25.627
we're talking about us all being
able to leave our bodies behind.

26:25.671 --> 26:27.760
NARRATOR: Sci-fi has
recently imagined

26:27.803 --> 26:29.500
one version of this metaverse

26:29.544 --> 26:31.459
where humans upload
to a server farm

26:31.502 --> 26:33.548
and choose, for whatever reason,

26:33.592 --> 26:35.855
a hip '80s dance club
to hang out in.

26:35.898 --> 26:37.291
THURSTON: There's an episode
of 'Black Mirror'

26:37.334 --> 26:39.206
that had a version of this

26:39.249 --> 26:42.775
where you uploaded your
consciousness to the cloud.

26:42.818 --> 26:45.299
And you could, you could choose
where you wanted to hang out.

26:45.342 --> 26:46.779
sort of what theme.

26:46.822 --> 26:48.694
And there were nightclubs
and beaches,

26:48.737 --> 26:52.045
and it was like
a resort style of life.

26:52.088 --> 26:53.916
NARRATOR: But bar culture aside,

26:53.960 --> 26:56.440
not having a physical body
will bring the human race

26:56.484 --> 26:59.661
to a whole new and
super-advanced level.

26:59.705 --> 27:02.708
We'll live as long as
the computers keep working away.

27:02.751 --> 27:04.666
So when we get old and wise,

27:04.710 --> 27:09.497
we'll be able to keep on
getting older and wiser.

27:09.540 --> 27:11.064
MICHAEL GRAZIANO: People
accumulate incredible amounts

27:11.107 --> 27:15.372
of experience over a lifetime,
and then it goes away.

27:15.416 --> 27:17.723
If you upload brains,
essentially what you're doing,

27:17.766 --> 27:20.682
you're preserving wisdom,
you're preserving knowledge.

27:20.726 --> 27:22.075
CHARLES SOULE:
Digital consciousness

27:22.118 --> 27:23.685
is going to drastically
change the way

27:23.729 --> 27:25.556
human beings think
about their lives

27:25.600 --> 27:26.906
and what they're supposed
to achieve with them.

27:26.949 --> 27:28.603
We'll become a very, very
different species.

27:28.647 --> 27:32.085
MIRA: I'll leave my body behind
for another body,

27:32.128 --> 27:35.610
but I don't want to like
be put into a car

27:35.654 --> 27:37.917
or like, you know,
I don't want to be KITT.

27:37.960 --> 27:41.703
That wouldn't be fun for me.

27:41.747 --> 27:43.749
NARRATOR: I'm going to have
to disagree with you, Matt.

27:43.792 --> 27:46.186
Being able to go 100 miles
an hour on the Autobahn

27:46.229 --> 27:47.970
doesn't sound too shabby.

27:48.014 --> 27:49.972
That's why there are
some intrepid explorers

27:50.016 --> 27:52.801
who will welcome
that chance to upload.

27:57.240 --> 27:59.155
OSCAR: There are boundaries,
Eva.

27:59.199 --> 28:01.070
There are lines you can't cross,
even for us.

28:01.114 --> 28:03.159
EVA: But why,
why should there be?

28:03.203 --> 28:08.643
There is a whole universe
of new places and new ideas.

28:08.687 --> 28:11.733
Why keep getting pulled back
into a physical body?

28:11.777 --> 28:14.518
OSCAR: We don't even know
all the risks.

28:14.562 --> 28:17.913
What's to stop me from
being copied or hacked?

28:17.957 --> 28:24.006
EVA: Oscar, I want to live in
the digital world permanently.

28:24.050 --> 28:26.356
I want to upload for good.

28:26.400 --> 28:32.014
Why worry about pain and death
if we can live forever there?

28:32.058 --> 28:32.928
OSCAR: Does it even count
as living

28:32.972 --> 28:34.887
if your physical body's dead?

28:34.930 --> 28:37.237
EVA: I've been thinking about
this for a long time.

28:37.280 --> 28:41.545
And I know what I've got to do.

28:41.589 --> 28:47.203
But I would rather do it
with your support.

28:47.247 --> 28:48.944
OSCAR: Okay.

29:00.913 --> 29:03.045
NARRATOR: Someday enough people
like Eva will make that leap

29:03.089 --> 29:04.568
to live digitally.

29:04.612 --> 29:09.922
That's when a new society
will form...online.

29:09.965 --> 29:11.662
ROSENDALE: I think
the digital world will form

29:11.706 --> 29:17.668
kind of bottom-up, the same way
a society like America did.

29:17.712 --> 29:19.801
Small cities and groups
that kind of fused together

29:19.845 --> 29:22.804
and found each other
over long periods of time.

29:22.848 --> 29:25.415
NICE: The great thing about
uploading your consciousness

29:25.459 --> 29:27.635
is go to work
looking any way I want.

29:27.678 --> 29:29.811
Hey, guys, I'm not wearing
any pants. Mm-hmm.

29:29.855 --> 29:32.945
Seriously! Who truly wants
to wear pants to work?

29:32.988 --> 29:36.209
Nobody.

29:36.252 --> 29:38.385
NARRATOR: And it is that promise
of being equally free

29:38.428 --> 29:41.649
from both oppressive leadership
and pants

29:41.692 --> 29:42.868
that could propel
people like Eva

29:42.911 --> 29:46.828
to run off and join
the metaverse.

29:46.872 --> 29:51.311
But will it actually be possible
to digitize your mind?

29:51.354 --> 29:53.617
Futurists like Elon Musk
are banking on it.

29:53.661 --> 29:55.837
He's already unveiled
the Neuralink initiative,

29:55.881 --> 29:57.970
which will link the brain
with computing devices

29:58.013 --> 29:59.885
in the next 10 years.

29:59.928 --> 30:01.930
GEORGE DVORSKY: There are
several attempts right now

30:01.974 --> 30:04.063
around the world to map the
brain in excruciating detail,

30:04.106 --> 30:05.891
and that's what's required.

30:05.934 --> 30:08.023
GRAZIANO:
It's scanning technology.

30:08.067 --> 30:12.419
So it's possible, it's going
to happen, I'm positive of that.

30:12.462 --> 30:14.682
NARRATOR: So you will be
part of a computer.

30:14.725 --> 30:16.858
Yes, it sounds freaky.

30:16.902 --> 30:18.904
But here's a major upside--

30:18.947 --> 30:22.298
we could bring our dead
back to life.

30:22.342 --> 30:25.954
One futurist is already working
toward doing just that.

30:29.392 --> 30:32.352
RAY KURZWEIL: I've had a project
to gather all the information

30:32.395 --> 30:34.049
about my father.

30:34.093 --> 30:37.444
He died when I was 22, in 1970.

30:37.487 --> 30:41.361
He kept all of his letters
and all of his electric bills,

30:41.404 --> 30:45.017
and every document.

30:45.060 --> 30:51.153
The idea is to create an avatar
that would represent my father.

30:51.197 --> 30:53.025
Ultimately, I think
artificial intelligence

30:53.068 --> 30:58.682
can create a virtual person.

30:58.726 --> 31:01.816
GRAZIANO: So your friend
passes away.

31:01.860 --> 31:05.820
So now you can text your virtual
friend, and he'll answer.

31:05.864 --> 31:08.344
It's like back in the day
when people looked at a statue

31:08.388 --> 31:10.564
and thought it had
a little bit of the soul

31:10.607 --> 31:14.524
and essence of
the original person in it.

31:14.568 --> 31:16.135
KAKU: Why not have
a holographic image

31:16.178 --> 31:20.008
with all the memories and
mannerisms of Winston Churchill?

31:20.052 --> 31:21.618
In the future,

31:21.662 --> 31:27.102
your descendants may go to
the library and talk to you.

31:27.146 --> 31:28.364
NARRATOR: Now here is where

31:28.408 --> 31:31.150
things get
philosophically sticky.

31:31.193 --> 31:34.066
When we are all bodiless
computer signals,

31:34.109 --> 31:37.286
is that still humanity?

31:37.330 --> 31:40.115
KAKU: Now, of course, it all
goes back to the question of

31:40.159 --> 31:42.944
how do you define you?

31:42.988 --> 31:45.991
Is that really you
that's been digitalized

31:46.034 --> 31:48.210
and uploaded in a computer?

31:48.254 --> 31:50.560
Well, it depends on
how you define you,

31:50.604 --> 31:53.781
and how you define soul.

31:53.824 --> 31:57.785
BRIAN GREENE: I'd like to think
that what makes us who we are

31:57.828 --> 31:59.874
transcends our physical form.

31:59.918 --> 32:05.010
And if we evolve to a
digital form, a simulated form,

32:05.053 --> 32:09.449
the essence of who we are
will stay with us.

32:09.492 --> 32:11.320
MIRA: I think we are
our consciousness.

32:11.364 --> 32:14.758
I think we are our experiences.

32:14.802 --> 32:18.371
NARRATOR: Okay, so in
a digitally rendered metaverse,

32:18.414 --> 32:19.981
what about our flaws?

32:20.025 --> 32:22.462
Is that digital world
utterly perfect,

32:22.505 --> 32:26.596
with no parking tickets or
getting fired or messy breakups?

32:26.640 --> 32:29.686
How do you have something
as awesome as blues music

32:29.730 --> 32:31.862
if there's no heartache?

32:31.906 --> 32:34.039
Well, I, for one, am hoping
the programmers think of that

32:34.082 --> 32:36.041
before I plug in.

32:36.084 --> 32:38.130
BRIAN MICHAEL BENDIS: There's
that great line in The Matrix

32:38.173 --> 32:43.004
where they describe that they
had created a different matrix

32:43.048 --> 32:45.180
that was perfect,
it was like heaven.

32:45.224 --> 32:47.704
And the humans rejected it.

32:47.748 --> 32:55.016
Like they needed a crappy life
to, to see as reality.

32:55.060 --> 32:57.888
NARRATOR: Even if the metaverse
2.0 has a few warts

32:57.932 --> 32:59.368
to keep us interesting,

32:59.412 --> 33:03.155
I'm thinking the perk of
cheating death is awesome enough

33:03.198 --> 33:05.113
that the lines on day one

33:05.157 --> 33:06.593
are going to be like
the ones you stood on

33:06.636 --> 33:09.074
for your Nintendo Switch.

33:09.117 --> 33:13.165
But there is a truly terrifying
aspect of metaverse 2.0--

33:13.208 --> 33:14.949
you open yourself up
to getting hacked.

33:14.993 --> 33:17.908
But it's not your computer
getting hacked here,

33:17.952 --> 33:19.084
it's your brain.

33:26.265 --> 33:38.277
♪

33:38.320 --> 33:40.627
NARRATOR: In the first
incarnation of the metaverse,

33:40.670 --> 33:44.544
version 1.0, the digital world
will be an escape

33:44.587 --> 33:46.241
from the real world.

33:46.285 --> 33:50.506
But in metaverse 2.0,
when we leave our bodies behind,

33:50.550 --> 33:53.161
that's the point of no return.

33:53.205 --> 33:54.902
JESS: Dad.

33:54.945 --> 34:08.481
♪

34:08.524 --> 34:10.178
NARRATOR: It's like volunteering

34:10.222 --> 34:13.747
to go on that first
long flight to Mars.

34:13.790 --> 34:16.576
It's probably a one-way ticket.

34:16.619 --> 34:19.187
It will be the end of humanity.

34:19.231 --> 34:22.495
But even for those with the best
intentions like Eva here,

34:22.538 --> 34:26.238
there are stakes
that we cannot ignore.

34:30.764 --> 34:33.723
FARSAD: There's the kind
of rosy possibility

34:33.767 --> 34:35.682
that the metaverse
would bring us together,

34:35.725 --> 34:38.685
that we'd all be able
to convene in this place,

34:38.728 --> 34:43.777
and we'd all look gorgeous
'cause of our avatars.

34:43.820 --> 34:49.696
But then there's also this kind
of, like, darker possibility,

34:49.739 --> 34:52.960
you know, where we learn that
being in the metaverse

34:53.003 --> 34:57.007
is actually like no substitute
for actual human interaction,

34:57.051 --> 35:01.273
and that it creates maybe
more division, more seclusion,

35:01.316 --> 35:04.189
more isolation,
maybe like more bigotry,

35:04.232 --> 35:08.018
and like maybe just like
a far worse society.

35:08.062 --> 35:09.281
NARRATOR: Chances are
you've clicked 'accept'

35:09.324 --> 35:11.500
on those privacy agreements
that come up

35:11.544 --> 35:15.504
when you download an Internet
application or enter a website.

35:15.548 --> 35:17.941
Ever read those
privacy agreements?

35:17.985 --> 35:19.378
Me neither.

35:19.421 --> 35:22.424
If that's the gateway to
the newest social media site

35:22.468 --> 35:25.993
that everyone else is using, of
course you're going to say yes.

35:26.036 --> 35:28.256
Thing is, sometimes you're
giving a giant conglomerate

35:28.300 --> 35:31.955
access to the kind of things
you'd rather not let them know,

35:31.999 --> 35:35.655
things like your browser history
or your email address.

35:35.698 --> 35:37.961
If that sounds a little too
Big Brother for you,

35:38.005 --> 35:41.530
imagine what life will be like
when you are digital,

35:41.574 --> 35:44.054
and your world is the metaverse,

35:44.098 --> 35:48.363
and you can't exist unless
you let the metaverse access

35:48.407 --> 35:52.846
every memory and thought
in your brain.

35:52.889 --> 35:55.240
Houston, we have a problem.

35:55.283 --> 35:56.980
Especially since it's likely

35:57.024 --> 35:58.634
that something as big
as the metaverse

35:58.678 --> 36:02.290
isn't going to be built by
a couple of kindhearted hackers

36:02.334 --> 36:04.249
in their spare time.

36:04.292 --> 36:08.340
GRAZIANO: I imagine that
initially, at least,

36:08.383 --> 36:10.603
this is corporate control.

36:10.646 --> 36:13.867
Because what other entity
has the resources

36:13.910 --> 36:16.043
to build something like this?

36:16.086 --> 36:21.353
And so you have an incredible
concentration of power

36:21.396 --> 36:24.617
in corporate hands.

36:24.660 --> 36:26.793
LOUIS ROSENBERG: We could
ultimately create a replica

36:26.836 --> 36:32.059
of our own world that is just
giving power to third parties.

36:32.102 --> 36:35.323
And that company has
goals and aspirations.

36:35.367 --> 36:38.935
Those goals and aspirations are
probably to sell you something,

36:38.979 --> 36:41.677
to study you,
to collect data about you.

36:41.721 --> 36:44.941
People will lose more and more
of their privacy.

36:44.985 --> 36:48.249
They will be advertised to
more and more.

36:48.293 --> 36:49.598
They will be manipulated

36:49.642 --> 36:51.861
by these
artificial intelligence bots

36:51.905 --> 36:53.820
that are running
behind the scenes.

36:53.863 --> 36:55.343
DVORSKY: You could get
a situation

36:55.387 --> 36:57.258
where there's a kind
of hydraulic despotism,

36:57.302 --> 36:59.434
which is an old-fashioned term
that basically says

36:59.478 --> 37:01.523
that if you control
a very fundamental resource,

37:01.567 --> 37:03.917
you control everything.

37:03.960 --> 37:06.746
ROSE EVELETH: I want to have
very detailed privacy controls

37:06.789 --> 37:08.530
on that upload.

37:08.574 --> 37:10.967
NARRATOR: Not that I have
anything to hide,

37:11.011 --> 37:12.665
but I might have
one or two secrets

37:12.708 --> 37:14.449
I don't want
the Metaverse Corporation

37:14.493 --> 37:16.408
getting their hands on.

37:16.451 --> 37:18.279
You'd hope we'd be smart enough
to click 'decline'

37:18.323 --> 37:20.281
on any metaverse like this.

37:20.325 --> 37:21.500
And some believe that
it's a long shot

37:21.543 --> 37:23.197
that our new digital world

37:23.241 --> 37:25.939
will be in the hands
of one single company.

37:25.982 --> 37:28.507
ROSEDALE: The largest-scale
systems that we have today

37:28.550 --> 37:30.509
are almost all decentralized.

37:30.552 --> 37:34.295
They're never owned by one
company except in the movies.

37:34.339 --> 37:38.343
And so I believe that VR,
and hopefully AI,

37:38.386 --> 37:41.389
these will be
the product of everyone.

37:41.433 --> 37:45.088
I think that someone,
hopefully me and my company,

37:45.132 --> 37:49.354
will build a standard
kind of open source server

37:49.397 --> 37:51.094
that lets millions of people

37:51.138 --> 37:54.489
start to put up little
communities and meeting places

37:54.533 --> 37:57.753
and teaching facilities.

37:57.797 --> 38:00.495
NARRATOR: Even in that
kind of best-case scenario,

38:00.539 --> 38:02.454
we are still human.

38:02.497 --> 38:04.978
We'll still be greedy or angry

38:05.021 --> 38:08.590
or violent towards
each other sometimes.

38:08.634 --> 38:12.246
SANDBERG: People will always do
what they do in the real world

38:12.290 --> 38:13.595
in the virtual worlds, too.

38:13.639 --> 38:15.336
So of course we're going
to see crime,

38:15.380 --> 38:17.120
and of course
we're going to see attempts

38:17.164 --> 38:21.516
at both preventing it
and punishing it.

38:21.560 --> 38:24.171
There are both questions
of virtual theft,

38:24.214 --> 38:27.696
but also virtual sexual
harassment, virtual rape,

38:27.740 --> 38:33.485
virtual murder, maybe, if you
delete somebody's character.

38:33.528 --> 38:34.486
ROSENDALE:
Although we won't be able

38:34.529 --> 38:36.488
to come to physical harm there,

38:36.531 --> 38:38.533
we'll still be able
to hurt each other.

38:38.577 --> 38:41.231
People will still be able to
isolate themselves from others,

38:41.275 --> 38:44.409
or make someone more alone than
they want to be, for example,

38:44.452 --> 38:46.628
or exclude then from a group.

38:46.672 --> 38:51.372
It means that people will still
have control over each other.

38:51.416 --> 38:52.765
DVORSKY: You as a digital copy

38:52.808 --> 38:54.462
are going to be
under constant threat.

38:54.506 --> 38:56.377
Somebody might want to copy you
against your will.

38:56.421 --> 38:59.728
There's even potential for the
corruption of your source code.

38:59.772 --> 39:01.426
NEWITZ:
I mean, I think, you know,

39:01.469 --> 39:04.429
you're looking at
future regulatory agencies,

39:04.472 --> 39:05.865
and you're looking at something

39:05.908 --> 39:11.392
like health regulatory agencies
of today.

39:11.436 --> 39:14.308
MIRA: I don't know who
wants the metaverse.

39:14.352 --> 39:19.661
You, you just wind up...
it's like social media.

39:19.705 --> 39:21.968
I think if the metaverse is
anything like social media,

39:22.011 --> 39:24.971
we're in for a rough ride.

39:25.014 --> 39:26.842
NARRATOR: If you don't want
to cross over,

39:26.886 --> 39:30.672
how will you negotiate living in
what's left of the real world?

39:30.716 --> 39:33.545
Especially if your wife
of several hundred years

39:33.588 --> 39:36.417
has made the decision to upload?

39:41.727 --> 39:46.122
[air hissing]

39:46.166 --> 39:47.820
JESS: Hey, stranger.

39:47.863 --> 39:51.476
OSCAR: This is a nice surprise.

39:51.519 --> 39:55.088
Oh, could you, uh, could you,
could you pass me that brush?

39:55.131 --> 40:01.877
Yeah, thanks.

40:01.921 --> 40:04.271
JESS: Mom's been asking
after you.

40:15.195 --> 40:17.458
You know there's no reason
why you can't visit.

40:17.502 --> 40:22.115
OSCAR: Yeah, I know,
I've just, I've been busy.

40:22.158 --> 40:24.160
JESS: You've been avoiding her.

40:32.865 --> 40:34.475
If you want to be
together forever,

40:34.519 --> 40:37.435
the only place to do it is
in the collective.

40:44.659 --> 40:58.760
♪

40:58.804 --> 41:02.721
NARRATOR: Well, I get how Oscar
might not want to have a life

41:02.764 --> 41:05.158
that could be ended
with a delete key.

41:05.201 --> 41:08.640
But the thing is, we've already
started our gradual transition

41:08.683 --> 41:10.380
into living digitally.

41:10.424 --> 41:11.730
You probably didn't even notice

41:11.773 --> 41:14.428
just how much you were
using your phone's GPS

41:14.472 --> 41:17.344
until you were
utterly dependent on it.

41:17.387 --> 41:19.651
Well, that's how it'll be

41:19.694 --> 41:22.610
when you can start to plug
into the metaverse.

41:22.654 --> 41:26.701
It'll gradually take over
without your ever knowing it.

41:26.745 --> 41:29.922
Unless it already has.

41:29.965 --> 41:32.533
I am sorry to be the one
to tell you this,

41:32.577 --> 41:35.405
but the metaverse may have
already been built,

41:35.449 --> 41:37.799
and we are in it.

41:37.843 --> 41:39.409
Can you prove that
we aren't living

41:39.453 --> 41:41.803
inside a giant
digital simulation

41:41.847 --> 41:45.372
built by
an advanced civilization?

41:45.415 --> 41:49.419
I'll answer that.
No, you can't.

41:49.463 --> 41:56.557
Which means maybe all you see,
all you are, is just software.

42:07.046 --> 42:08.395
NARRATOR: For better or worse,

42:08.438 --> 42:12.747
humanity's future
is in the cloud.

42:12.791 --> 42:15.663
We'll plug in,
abandon our mortal coil

42:15.707 --> 42:18.536
and live eternally
in the metaverse.

42:21.539 --> 42:24.585
Just like our future family,

42:24.629 --> 42:26.587
burning a few
simulated s'mores

42:26.631 --> 42:29.634
around a virtual campfire.

42:29.677 --> 42:32.593
Just like life, right?

42:32.637 --> 42:36.989
But that's what leads to our
most bone-chilling idea yet.

42:37.032 --> 42:41.254
There is a possibility that the
metaverse isn't in the future,

42:41.297 --> 42:43.996
but that we are living in it
right now,

42:44.039 --> 42:47.129
and everything around you
is a simulation.

42:50.524 --> 42:53.396
GREENE: How hard would it be
to create a new universe

42:53.440 --> 42:55.485
in the traditional sense?

42:55.529 --> 42:57.618
That's pretty tough.

42:57.662 --> 43:01.013
How hard is it to create a new
universe in the simulated sense?

43:01.056 --> 43:02.841
Not that tough.

43:02.884 --> 43:04.886
You get a powerful computer,
turn it on, kick back,

43:04.930 --> 43:07.802
and let the software go
and create that realm.

43:07.846 --> 43:09.891
Which means, over time,
you would think

43:09.935 --> 43:12.633
there'd be many more
simulated universes

43:12.677 --> 43:16.028
than real universes.

43:16.071 --> 43:17.682
The odds would suggest

43:17.725 --> 43:20.206
that everybody should
come to the conclusion

43:20.249 --> 43:24.732
that they are
in a simulated world.

43:24.776 --> 43:26.821
That would be
the natural conclusion

43:26.865 --> 43:29.084
that any rational,
logical, sentient being

43:29.128 --> 43:33.741
would come to in this framework.

43:33.785 --> 43:35.351
DVORSKY: We ourselves
might be parked

43:35.395 --> 43:37.136
inside of some kind of
fancy super-computer

43:37.179 --> 43:41.009
that's being run by, you know,
our post-human forebears.

43:41.053 --> 43:43.011
THURSTON: So, we're living
in a simulation.

43:43.055 --> 43:46.667
We could just be living
off of feeding tubes,

43:46.711 --> 43:50.889
hanging out in The Matrix.

43:50.932 --> 43:52.673
HOD LIPSON:
I think it's impossible to tell

43:52.717 --> 43:54.719
by definition.

43:57.722 --> 44:00.899
NARRATOR: The idea is that
on an infinite timeline,

44:00.942 --> 44:03.858
with infinite possible
alien species out there,

44:03.902 --> 44:05.686
and with the relative ease

44:05.730 --> 44:08.515
of building a digital
environment on a computer,

44:08.558 --> 44:12.824
odds are that some intelligent
race somewhere has built one.

44:12.867 --> 44:17.785
And more likely than not, there
are lots of these universes.

44:17.829 --> 44:21.397
I, for one, am not finding that
particularly comforting.

44:25.880 --> 44:27.142
BETTNER: It's kind of the only
thing that makes sense.

44:27.186 --> 44:29.318
All the stuff that is
happening right now,

44:29.362 --> 44:31.973
seems it only has
one inevitable conclusion,

44:32.017 --> 44:33.061
you know what I'm saying?

44:33.105 --> 44:34.802
[laughs]

44:34.846 --> 44:36.761
ROSEDALE: Virtual worlds exhibit
these little cracks

44:36.804 --> 44:38.850
or flaws in them.

44:38.893 --> 44:40.503
Well, guess what?

44:40.547 --> 44:44.377
We see these little cracks
in the simulation

44:44.420 --> 44:46.771
when we look at the real world.

44:46.814 --> 44:49.730
Stuff in the real world,
protons and electrons,

44:49.774 --> 44:51.384
will sometimes go
right through each other

44:51.427 --> 44:52.864
when they're not supposed to.

44:52.907 --> 44:55.910
And so the funny hypothesis
that comes from this is,

44:55.954 --> 44:58.783
if we're seeing this problem
with creating virtual worlds,

44:58.826 --> 45:00.785
and we're seeing this problem
in the real world,

45:00.828 --> 45:03.831
doesn't this mean that because
we see these little errors

45:03.875 --> 45:05.398
in the real world,

45:05.441 --> 45:08.444
we're probably running
on somebody's computer?

45:08.488 --> 45:10.011
MIRA: There's a theory out there

45:10.055 --> 45:12.797
that we might already be
living in a simulation,

45:12.840 --> 45:17.105
to which I say, try harder.

45:17.149 --> 45:20.152
This is not a great simulation.

45:20.195 --> 45:23.416
There's still a lot of garbage
happening in the world,

45:23.459 --> 45:26.636
and I don't love the way
it's being simulated.

45:29.465 --> 45:31.206
NARRATOR: The most recent
election has inspired

45:31.250 --> 45:35.907
a new round of 'this can't be
real' in the Twitterverse.

45:35.950 --> 45:38.126
Look, it all goes back
to Descartes,

45:38.170 --> 45:39.998
'I think, therefore I am.'

45:40.041 --> 45:43.175
It's old philosophy
with really new tech.

45:43.218 --> 45:45.003
If I'm a simulation,

45:45.046 --> 45:47.701
should I not bother
going to the gym anymore?

45:47.745 --> 45:52.227
Or will that just mean that
my avatar gets flabby?

45:52.271 --> 45:55.927
You can go down a rabbit hole
thinking about it.

45:55.970 --> 45:59.060
THURSTON: Maybe the race of
beings that controls that world

45:59.104 --> 46:02.498
is so significantly
more powerful,

46:02.542 --> 46:05.588
creative, clever,
and dominating,

46:05.632 --> 46:11.856
that we die out of mere fear,
that we wither under,

46:11.899 --> 46:14.902
'cause we can't handle
that truth.

46:14.946 --> 46:18.166
Maybe the simulation
is to protect us

46:18.210 --> 46:21.909
from a harsher reality.

46:21.953 --> 46:23.432
LIPSON: Did we kill ourselves
in between?

46:23.476 --> 46:24.956
Did we lose control?

46:24.999 --> 46:26.871
Is there a battle
between AI and humans?

46:26.914 --> 46:29.699
Is the battle between
the have and have-nots

46:29.743 --> 46:32.398
with AI before that?

46:32.441 --> 46:35.183
NARRATOR: Those are questions
we just can't answer yet.

46:35.227 --> 46:37.316
But believe you me,
I'm hoping we do.

46:37.359 --> 46:39.971
Simulated or not,
in the Year Million,

46:40.014 --> 46:42.234
we will shed
our physical selves,

46:42.277 --> 46:44.279
view the human form
as something

46:44.323 --> 46:47.413
that held our consciousness
and our society back,

46:47.456 --> 46:52.070
in the dirty old dark ages when
we were enslaved to biology.

46:52.113 --> 46:53.245
Let's look down the road,

46:53.288 --> 46:56.117
to after we exist
on some hard drive.

46:56.161 --> 46:58.076
Communication will
change drastically.

46:58.119 --> 47:00.992
Language itself will be
