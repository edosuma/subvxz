02:43.411 --> 02:45.285
Oh. Hmm.

02:45.413 --> 02:47.287
Oh. Oh.

02:47.415 --> 02:49.159
I`m up!

02:52.129 --> 02:56.043
- Ah.
- Phillip, it`s 7:00. Are you awake?

02:56.133 --> 02:59.383
Up and ready for a new day.

02:59.470 --> 03:02.554
- Oh!
- Oh what a beautiful morning

03:02.640 --> 03:04.597
Oh what a beautiful day

03:36.384 --> 03:39.800
- I can`t find my socks.
- They`re in your shoes.

03:39.929 --> 03:42.385
- Where are my shoes?
- They`re on your feet.

03:42.473 --> 03:44.383
Thank you.

03:50.982 --> 03:54.767
Thank you, Weber.

03:58.991 --> 04:00.865
Hi.

04:02.912 --> 04:05.829
- Have you seen the paper this morning?
- Oh, yes, I did.

04:05.957 --> 04:08.033
You know, if I could solve
this whole metastable compound business,

04:08.167 --> 04:10.160
I could save the college.

04:10.294 --> 04:12.501
A new energy source
would be worth a fortune.

04:12.630 --> 04:15.916
You better hurry up. The loan`s due
at the end of the school year.

04:16.009 --> 04:19.543
Not to worry, Weebo.
I`m very close.

04:19.678 --> 04:21.719
May I see my schedule, please?

04:21.848 --> 04:24.968
Ahhhh. After school
there`s something.

04:25.102 --> 04:26.976
I know there is. What is it?

04:27.104 --> 04:29.393
- This is your complete schedule.
- Hmm. Let`s see.

04:29.523 --> 04:31.432
Unless you didn`t
tell me something.

04:31.525 --> 04:33.648
What is it? There`s something.
There`s something there.

04:33.778 --> 04:35.687
What is it? Oh.

04:35.821 --> 04:37.861
It`s something to do with white.

04:37.990 --> 04:40.564
Oh, what is it? I know it`s
something important. I know it!

04:40.702 --> 04:43.489
Well, I don`t know. I`m sorry.
I know it`s so frustrating, isn`t it?

04:43.621 --> 04:46.077
I just hate that.
I wish I could help you.

04:46.207 --> 04:49.292
- But I can`t.
- Haircut!

04:49.377 --> 04:52.747
Ha! Hmm!

04:54.883 --> 04:56.793
They can`t just
close down the school.

04:56.885 --> 04:59.673
Outside of the lvy League,
name me one private college...

04:59.805 --> 05:03.139
or university that isn`t
in financial trouble.

05:03.225 --> 05:05.977
Oh, all right. Name another.

05:06.062 --> 05:10.890
- You don`t think it`s too much?
- No. It`s elegant.

05:11.025 --> 05:14.691
And it`s a wonderful idea to go
with the big wedding this time.

05:14.779 --> 05:17.946
It does put the pressure
on the professor to show up.

05:18.074 --> 05:20.447
If he forgets this time,
that`s it.

05:20.577 --> 05:23.199
Well, in his case,
once is justifiable...

05:23.288 --> 05:27.369
and twice is understandable,
but three times--

05:28.877 --> 05:30.751
Coming through!

05:40.598 --> 05:42.970
Morning-- or afternoon,
whatever the case may be.

05:43.101 --> 05:46.719
We have a lot to talk about today,
so let`s get into it without delay.

05:46.813 --> 05:50.313
Oh! Oh, uh, thank you,
whoever gave me the plate of fruit...

05:50.442 --> 05:52.565
and the dead pheasant,

05:52.694 --> 05:54.568
but it does not count
as extra credit.

05:54.696 --> 05:57.401
Last time we were talking about
Newton`s Law of Gravitation.

05:57.491 --> 06:01.987
To review: We see this "G"
is like the "C" in E=MC squared.

06:02.121 --> 06:05.241
It`s a constant, constant universe,
as much as anything
is constant in the universe.

06:05.374 --> 06:07.747
It`s saying that the force of
attraction between two bodies...

06:07.877 --> 06:10.629
is in direct proportion to
the product of their masses...

06:10.755 --> 06:12.997
and in inverse proportion to the square
of the distance between them.

06:13.133 --> 06:18.589
An example would be-- Let`s make, uh,
naked man, "M-1." Naked lady, "M-2."

06:18.680 --> 06:20.922
Now, according to this formula,
their attractive forces...

06:21.058 --> 06:23.762
would want to close
the distance to zero.

06:23.894 --> 06:26.765
Why don`t they? Hmm?

06:26.897 --> 06:28.854
The Earth! Ah.

06:28.983 --> 06:32.933
So, in essence that is
gravity and this...

06:33.070 --> 06:36.938
is "Dr Richards Life Drawing."

06:37.074 --> 06:39.447
It`s not my class, is it?

06:48.587 --> 06:50.994
Phillip! Over here!

06:51.131 --> 06:53.836
Sara! Ooh! Very sorry.

06:55.594 --> 06:58.168
And so, momentum.

06:58.305 --> 07:02.089
May I sit here? Thank you.

07:02.184 --> 07:05.304
Hello, Sara.
What a pleasant surprise.

07:05.396 --> 07:08.397
- Hello, Ruthie.
- Martha.

07:08.524 --> 07:10.517
- Martha what?
- Martha. Me Martha.

07:10.652 --> 07:13.190
You Martha. Me professor.

07:13.321 --> 07:16.156
- Yes, I know.
- I was just gonna, you know,

07:16.241 --> 07:19.028
grade my lunch, eat a few tests
and hope for the best.

07:19.161 --> 07:21.652
- How do you hold it in?
- Well, like everybody else, Ruthie.

07:21.788 --> 07:24.458
I just cross my legs real tight.

07:24.541 --> 07:26.830
No. I was talking
about your excitement.

07:26.960 --> 07:29.831
- Excitement?
- The wedding.

07:29.964 --> 07:33.167
Congratulations!

07:35.344 --> 07:37.586
The wedding! Sara and l.
Oh, the wedding.

07:37.722 --> 07:39.845
Oh, l`m looking forward to it.
Aren`t you, honey?

07:39.933 --> 07:42.720
- It`s today.
- Are you sure?

07:44.229 --> 07:46.898
- The wedding is today. Okay?
- I believe you.

07:47.023 --> 07:51.068
6:30 at the Presbyterian Church
on Beach Street.

07:51.194 --> 07:54.694
- I`ve been there.
- We had our rehearsal there last night.

07:54.823 --> 07:58.738
That`s right, we did!
It went well?

07:58.869 --> 08:00.743
- Yes, it did, but it doesn`t count.
- Good.

08:00.871 --> 08:03.493
- No?
- The wedding counts,
and I want you to promise me...

08:03.583 --> 08:06.702
on everything between us
that you`ll be there, okay?

08:06.794 --> 08:08.704
I`d rather die
than disappoint you.

08:08.838 --> 08:13.547
Well, this is going to be
the very last time I try to marry you.

08:13.676 --> 08:16.002
I imagine so.

08:16.096 --> 08:18.005
I know that I love you,

08:18.098 --> 08:21.052
but l`m not sure
that you can love me.

08:22.436 --> 08:24.393
That`s ridiculous.

08:24.480 --> 08:26.389
I love you with all my heart.

08:26.482 --> 08:29.352
With every cell, with every
molecule, with every atom.

08:29.443 --> 08:31.732
I love you on a subatomic level.

08:31.821 --> 08:34.738
Hmm! Prove it to me
tonight at 6:30.

08:34.866 --> 08:36.739
Prove what, honey?

08:39.287 --> 08:41.445
- That you love me.
- I love you.

08:43.457 --> 08:46.245
- 6:30.
- Good luck.

08:47.462 --> 08:49.336
Thank you, Betty.

08:49.464 --> 08:52.252
I knew I shouldn`t
have come, but--

08:52.384 --> 08:54.875
Oh, l`m very crazy about him,
you see, Miss French.

08:54.970 --> 08:57.093
And this is the God`s truth:

08:57.181 --> 08:59.933
I want him to have
what he wants,

09:00.059 --> 09:02.135
even if it means
you instead of me.

09:02.269 --> 09:05.804
No, no! You love him.
Don`t give him up.

09:10.153 --> 09:12.442
Hey! l`m watching something!

09:13.823 --> 09:16.611
- Weber!
- Why don`t you be quiet?

09:16.701 --> 09:19.275
I`m watching TV.

09:19.413 --> 09:22.118
Download some manners! Ohh!

09:22.249 --> 09:24.705
Oh, but he ain`t in love
with me, Miss French.

09:24.835 --> 09:27.291
Mmm. Tell me about it.

09:48.360 --> 09:50.234
Hello, Phil.

09:50.362 --> 09:52.983
What are you working on?

09:53.073 --> 09:56.158
Can`t remember?

09:56.285 --> 09:58.491
I understand.

09:58.621 --> 10:00.827
It`s a damn shame they`re
shutting your college down.

10:00.956 --> 10:03.827
I read about it in the paper.

10:03.918 --> 10:06.076
- It`s not over yet.
- Oh, we`re doing fine at Rutland.

10:06.212 --> 10:08.917
No such financial problems. Hey!

10:09.048 --> 10:11.171
Are you still working on
that lighter-than-air compound?

10:11.259 --> 10:13.382
It`s a, uh,
propulsive polymer and--

10:13.511 --> 10:15.884
I don`t mean to be rude,
Wilson, but l-- I have to go.

10:16.014 --> 10:18.007
You don`t seem too happy
to see me, Phil.

10:18.141 --> 10:20.467
- I`m not.
- Well--

10:20.561 --> 10:24.724
All the years we`ve known
each other, studying, working together.

10:24.857 --> 10:30.361
- What happened between us, Phil?
- Well, I just got tired of you
stealing my ideas, Wilson.

10:30.446 --> 10:33.566
And what would you have done with them?
You would have misplaced them,

10:33.699 --> 10:36.570
forgotten them, lost them.

10:36.703 --> 10:38.612
There`s no doubt you`re
the brighter of the two of us.

10:38.746 --> 10:41.534
You have a genius for science.
I grant you that.

10:41.666 --> 10:43.955
It`s just the science
of daily life that eludes you.

10:44.085 --> 10:48.582
I`ve heard that copper psych
before. Excuse me. That`s very volatile.

10:48.715 --> 10:50.838
I won`t deny that I hate you
for your brilliance.

10:50.926 --> 10:53.382
I`m petty, corrupt.

10:53.512 --> 10:56.881
I probably would have gone mad trying
to compete with you in pure thought.

10:56.974 --> 11:00.058
But, uh, l`m not
an innovator like you, Phil.

11:00.144 --> 11:02.220
I`m an adapter, and to that end,

11:02.313 --> 11:04.804
I have profited from your ideas.

11:04.941 --> 11:07.432
- Why are you here?
- Well, to be honest,

11:07.569 --> 11:09.645
I`m here this weekend
to steal your fiancee...

11:09.779 --> 11:11.772
and make her my wife.

11:11.906 --> 11:15.572
Well, I think you`ll be
sadly disappointed.

11:15.702 --> 11:17.991
I`ll see you
at the wedding then.

11:21.542 --> 11:23.618
Eh, it`s a little crooked.

11:23.752 --> 11:25.626
- Yeah. There you go.
- Weebo?

11:25.754 --> 11:27.747
- Mm-hmm?
- The wedding was not on my schedule.

11:27.840 --> 11:30.413
- Mm, no?
- Why was that information deleted?

11:30.509 --> 11:33.926
Hmm. I don`t really know.

11:34.055 --> 11:36.213
- Do you have another virus?
- You know, now that you mention it,

11:36.307 --> 11:38.216
- I am feeling a little feverish.
- Really?

11:38.309 --> 11:40.219
Mm-hmm.

11:40.311 --> 11:42.269
You are a little hot. Say "ah."

11:42.355 --> 11:47.812
- Ah.
- Ah.

11:47.944 --> 11:50.862
Ah!

11:50.989 --> 11:53.445
Oh, yes!

11:54.827 --> 11:57.365
Hot. Cold. Hot. That`s it.

11:57.496 --> 11:59.454
The hydrocarbons have been
inhibiting the cooper pairs.

11:59.540 --> 12:01.663
But if you go from hot
to cold very quickly,

12:01.792 --> 12:06.087
you get a conductive polymer
and you complete the metastable sphere.

12:06.172 --> 12:08.710
Behold! There it is.

12:08.842 --> 12:11.297
Now it`ll work. Yes!

12:11.386 --> 12:14.304
But, uh, w-what about
your wedding?

12:15.599 --> 12:18.054
Sorry, Sara.

12:23.065 --> 12:25.983
Should I call the church
and tell them you`ll be late?

12:32.950 --> 12:35.488
Very good. Right.

12:41.543 --> 12:44.164
Very good. Ah.

12:44.254 --> 12:48.916
Flowing from the condenser
to the pressure reactor.

12:49.051 --> 12:50.925
Yes.

12:55.224 --> 12:57.430
Yes! Oh! lt`s ready.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.888
Organic catalyst.

13:05.026 --> 13:06.900
The positive...

13:07.028 --> 13:10.896
and the negative.

13:11.032 --> 13:13.274
Little touch of electricity.

13:16.997 --> 13:19.203
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

13:28.426 --> 13:31.047
Oh!

13:31.179 --> 13:33.848
Wow. What a bang.

13:33.931 --> 13:37.098
Yeah. Little touch
of electricity.

13:38.353 --> 13:40.595
That`s not helpful.

13:41.773 --> 13:43.647
Oh.

13:44.776 --> 13:47.730
Mmm. Mmm.

13:47.863 --> 13:52.988
- Oh, boy. This is not good.
- No, sir.
- Weebo?

13:53.118 --> 13:55.954
- What?
- Get a broom.
- That`ll help.

14:45.215 --> 14:47.124
Two years.

15:40.106 --> 15:42.183
Wow.

16:28.324 --> 16:30.613
Oh.

16:30.743 --> 16:34.278
Oh, bless you. You have a cold.

16:34.414 --> 16:36.572
You should.
It`s 77 degrees Kelvin.

16:36.666 --> 16:39.204
That`s very cold.

16:39.294 --> 16:41.915
Look. Come on.

16:42.047 --> 16:44.799
All right, uh,
let`s try and describe you.

16:44.925 --> 16:49.089
Uh, you`re an elastomer.
Yes, uh, um--

16:49.221 --> 16:51.095
Ooh! You`re highly viscous.

16:51.223 --> 16:53.097
But yet you can
phase-shift. Hoo!

16:53.225 --> 16:55.183
Well, uh, let`s see.

16:55.311 --> 16:57.767
You`re mouldable. Oh.

17:04.444 --> 17:06.319
It`s a little ticklish.

17:08.407 --> 17:10.864
Oh!

17:10.993 --> 17:14.659
You`re foldable.
You`re gullible.

17:14.790 --> 17:17.459
Oh. All right. Let`s see.

17:17.542 --> 17:22.288
Oh, wait a minute. Okay. And--

17:22.423 --> 17:25.377
Ooh. You`re ductile.

17:29.639 --> 17:32.556
Oh! Oh. You`re elastic.

17:32.684 --> 17:35.056
Let`s just see
how elastic you are. Okay.

17:48.742 --> 17:51.115
I`m the hackeysack king.

17:51.203 --> 17:53.529
Hoo!

17:53.664 --> 17:56.535
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

17:56.667 --> 17:59.241
Hey, hey!
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey!

18:03.383 --> 18:05.422
Bravo! Encore!

18:05.552 --> 18:08.755
- Oh, boy. Uh, Weebo?
- Yes, sir?

18:08.889 --> 18:11.558
- Take a picture.
- Okay. Look this way. Smile!

18:20.526 --> 18:22.519
Yeow!

18:25.781 --> 18:27.691
Ow!

18:37.377 --> 18:39.535
- Weebo! lt`s amazing!
- Professor? Excuse me.

18:39.629 --> 18:42.796
- It`s miraculous! lt`s--
- Professor, it`s gone!

18:42.924 --> 18:46.376
It is! Oh! Oh!

18:48.931 --> 18:52.051
Professor, I think you gave it
a little too much free will.

18:53.436 --> 18:55.642
Oh, no.

19:02.570 --> 19:05.061
There`s not a darn thing
to be afraid of, pal.

19:05.198 --> 19:07.570
How can anything
get in your window?

19:07.701 --> 19:09.574
It`s closed, okay?

19:09.703 --> 19:11.826
Whoa!

19:23.676 --> 19:25.254
Hey! Huh?

19:38.149 --> 19:40.438
Oh! Huh!

19:43.906 --> 19:47.109
- Whoa-oh!
- Yeah!

20:17.858 --> 20:19.566
Ha!

20:25.616 --> 20:28.653
Mmm! Whoa, Weebo! I got it!

20:28.786 --> 20:31.324
Great. Now what are you
gonna do with it?

20:31.456 --> 20:33.662
Oh! It has incredible inertia.

20:33.750 --> 20:36.917
Mm, maybe it`s
just glad to see you.

20:37.045 --> 20:39.121
- Weebo?
- Yes?

20:39.214 --> 20:41.705
- Do you know what this is?
- Flying rubber?

20:41.842 --> 20:44.843
Yes. That`s what it is.

20:44.970 --> 20:47.675
It`s flying rubber.

20:47.806 --> 20:50.179
It`s flubber!

20:52.228 --> 20:54.517
Ouch.

21:00.528 --> 21:03.019
- Thank you for waiting so long.
- Yes, ma`am.

21:10.539 --> 21:12.413
I`m sorry, Sara.

21:14.084 --> 21:16.207
Are you going to tell me,
"l told you so"?

21:16.295 --> 21:18.371
No, no.

21:18.505 --> 21:21.376
- I`m going to give you a ride home.
- Thank you.

21:25.763 --> 21:27.803
There you are.

21:27.932 --> 21:30.423
Careful. Watch your gown.

21:30.560 --> 21:32.849
I`ve got it. Thank you.

21:39.569 --> 21:43.069
It`s perfectly safe, Weebo. It`s just
an ordinary radioactive isotope...

21:44.950 --> 21:48.699
that Weber is now removing
from the lead containment unit.

21:49.830 --> 21:52.286
Very good, Weber.

21:52.416 --> 21:54.658
Then you place
the radioactive isotope...

21:54.794 --> 21:57.332
carefully behind
the sliding shutter.

21:59.299 --> 22:01.790
You see, the sliding shutter
works just like a camera.

22:01.926 --> 22:03.753
It regulates the flow
of gamma radiation.

22:03.845 --> 22:08.092
Instead of billions of random particles,
you have a precise stream of energy.

22:08.225 --> 22:13.812
Now we carefully place
the sliding shutter mechanism...

22:13.939 --> 22:16.477
underneath the flubber.

22:16.608 --> 22:19.100
And l`m burning up in here!
Weebo!

22:19.236 --> 22:21.110
Over here.

22:21.238 --> 22:24.275
The gamma radiation triggers a
metastable decay in the flubber itself.

22:24.367 --> 22:26.276
- Right.
- Which releases enormous
quantities of energy,

22:26.369 --> 22:28.278
- and that`s what propels the flubber.
- Of course.

22:28.371 --> 22:30.529
Now doing it this way,
I believe, is a lot more scientific...

22:30.665 --> 22:32.539
than dropping it
or kicking it...

22:32.667 --> 22:34.707
or bombarding it
with light bulb photon flashes.

22:34.836 --> 22:38.454
- Absolutely.
- I believe...

22:38.548 --> 22:41.300
by controlling
the gamma radiation flux,

22:41.385 --> 22:46.213
we can control the movement
of the flubber itself.

22:46.348 --> 22:48.970
- Cross your fingers, Weebo.
- Here`s hoping!
- Good luck.

22:54.023 --> 22:57.309
Oh, yes!

22:57.443 --> 22:59.732
It works!

23:03.742 --> 23:05.699
Descent, gradually.

23:08.663 --> 23:11.665
Back up again. Yeah!

23:16.338 --> 23:19.174
My wedding. Oh!

23:19.258 --> 23:21.334
- I`ve gotta go, Weebo.
- But you haven`t finished
the experiment yet.

23:21.469 --> 23:24.304
You`re just getting started.
You can`t just stop in the middle.

23:24.388 --> 23:27.010
The wedding. Oh, I can`t
miss this one, Weebo.

23:27.100 --> 23:29.176
I`m aware of the time.
Thank you.

23:29.269 --> 23:31.938
But your days are wrong.
I`m getting married Friday, 6:30 p.m.

23:32.063 --> 23:35.682
- No. No, you`re not.
- Why not?

23:35.775 --> 23:38.777
Because you`re not
getting married, Phillip.

23:38.904 --> 23:41.858
- Yes, I am.
- You missed the wedding.

23:41.949 --> 23:45.365
It`s 6:30 in the morning.

23:45.494 --> 23:47.866
No. No.

23:47.997 --> 23:50.404
Yes. I`m sorry.

23:56.214 --> 23:58.705
- It is?
- Yeah.

24:01.177 --> 24:03.585
Sara.

24:31.126 --> 24:33.035
Sara?

24:36.715 --> 24:39.467
You have a lot of nerve
to show your face around here...

24:39.593 --> 24:42.428
after what you did to me
last night.

24:42.513 --> 24:45.264
Will you please let me explain?

24:45.391 --> 24:50.598
No. There`s nothing to explain.
You weren`t there.

24:50.688 --> 24:53.440
For the third time you left me
standing at the altar.

24:55.568 --> 24:58.273
I`m sorry with all my heart.

24:58.363 --> 25:00.521
But please listen to me, Sara.
Please. You know me.

25:00.657 --> 25:03.444
You know how sometimes I can get
really fixated on an idea?

25:03.535 --> 25:05.444
- I don`t want to hear it.
- Sara, you`ve got to hear it.

25:05.537 --> 25:10.780
Sara, this is the reason
I didn`t make it last night.

25:12.503 --> 25:15.172
It`s flubber.

25:15.297 --> 25:17.835
Flubber! lt`s a metastable
compound, Sara.

25:17.967 --> 25:20.505
In layman`s terms, if you apply
a small amount of energy,

25:22.430 --> 25:24.304
it liberates an enormous
quantity of energy.

25:24.432 --> 25:26.306
But the total effect
is transient, Sara.

25:26.434 --> 25:30.432
The moment you stop applying energy,
it returns to a quasi-plasmoid state.

25:30.522 --> 25:34.306
- Isn`t it remarkable, Sara?
- What`s remarkable, Phillip,

25:34.442 --> 25:36.316
is that I ever fell
in love with you.

25:36.445 --> 25:39.648
You broke my heart...

25:39.740 --> 25:41.649
so that you could stay home
and make some green goo.

25:41.742 --> 25:43.984
Sara, it`s much more than that.

25:44.078 --> 25:47.162
Flubber could save this college.
Let me demonstrate.

25:47.248 --> 25:50.533
- No, no, no.
- Just give me one minute, okay?

25:52.879 --> 25:55.286
The flubber is placed
in my back pocket.

25:55.381 --> 25:58.169
When I exit this window,
I will fall to the ground.

25:58.259 --> 26:03.420
When I hit the ground, the flubber will
send me right back up unharmed. Watch.

26:11.315 --> 26:14.020
- Ta-ta, my love.
- Are you nuts?

26:14.151 --> 26:17.734
- I`ll be right back.
- Phillip!

26:17.863 --> 26:19.274
Ah!

26:21.868 --> 26:25.450
- Ouch.
- Phillip, are you hurt?

26:25.580 --> 26:27.656
Just my pride.

26:27.749 --> 26:31.450
Well, if you think that
you are going to get my sympathy,
you are wasting your time.

26:31.586 --> 26:34.421
Ooh! We are finished!

26:36.049 --> 26:38.836
Sara.

26:38.927 --> 26:41.964
Oh!

26:57.614 --> 26:59.737
Junior`s home.

27:02.035 --> 27:06.448
Dad? Dad!

27:07.791 --> 27:09.665
Dad?

27:13.213 --> 27:17.543
Somebody in your organization
screwed up big time.

27:17.635 --> 27:19.924
I got thrown off
the basketball team.

27:20.012 --> 27:25.683
I flunked chemistry.
I`m on, uh, academic probation.

27:25.810 --> 27:28.681
- How did this happen?
- I`m supposed to get A`s.

27:28.813 --> 27:31.684
- At least, that`s what I was told.
- The only reason...

27:31.816 --> 27:34.224
I loaned this "jerknut"
college money...

27:34.319 --> 27:38.862
was so he could get straight A`s
and go to Harvard Business School.

27:38.991 --> 27:41.446
- This isn`t supposed to happen.
- Yes, sir.

27:41.535 --> 27:44.987
We talked to the, uh, that Brainard guy,
the chemistry professor.

27:45.122 --> 27:47.792
Now, either he did not
understand us, or he forgot.

27:47.917 --> 27:50.372
The-The boy knew we were having
persuasion problems, sir.

27:50.503 --> 27:54.501
I have a science requirement,
you morons!

27:54.632 --> 27:56.708
Quiet.

27:56.843 --> 27:58.966
We`ll have to get the "F"
changed to an "A."

28:00.639 --> 28:04.304
It won`t work. This guy? He
doesn`t live in the real world.

28:04.434 --> 28:06.842
- He has principles.
- Get something on him...

28:06.979 --> 28:09.849
that we can use to force him
to change the kid`s grade.

28:09.982 --> 28:13.565
When a man says he has
principles, what he means is...

28:13.694 --> 28:16.363
he can`t be bought cheap.

28:40.889 --> 28:44.056
Hmm. Hmm.

28:50.274 --> 28:52.433
Adding 500 milligrams...

28:52.568 --> 28:55.938
crystallized flubber
to common hand cream.

28:56.072 --> 28:57.946
Stirring in solution.

29:00.201 --> 29:02.075
Hmm.

29:08.418 --> 29:11.585
Hmm. I just need one
spherical test subject.

29:14.550 --> 29:16.543
Mm. Perfect.

29:17.678 --> 29:19.718
Yeah. Now, about two--

29:24.269 --> 29:27.223
Applying flubber
in a solution...

29:27.355 --> 29:30.890
externally to golf ball.

29:33.570 --> 29:36.737
All right. Very good.

29:36.823 --> 29:40.074
Evenly over the entire surface.

29:40.202 --> 29:42.076
Kinetic test number one.

29:43.998 --> 29:46.323
Oh. Oh! Oh!

29:50.046 --> 29:52.454
Ooh! Ah!

29:58.638 --> 30:01.509
Are you all right?

30:01.641 --> 30:03.930
All right.

30:04.019 --> 30:07.435
Applying light coating
of flubber...

30:07.564 --> 30:09.604
to surface of bowling ball.

30:09.691 --> 30:11.601
All right.

30:11.735 --> 30:14.357
Oh. Very good.

30:16.032 --> 30:18.357
- Right in the head.
- That golf ball was really moving.

30:18.492 --> 30:20.366
- How`d he do that?
- I don`t know.

30:20.495 --> 30:23.449
Commencing kinetic energy
test number two.

30:23.581 --> 30:27.449
Controlling horizontal momentum.

30:27.585 --> 30:29.459
Commencing now.

30:32.007 --> 30:34.332
Hit the deck!

30:45.688 --> 30:48.559
This definitely has applications
in the field of sports.

30:48.691 --> 30:50.850
Ho, ho, ho! Yes!

30:57.534 --> 30:59.657
Oh!

31:09.630 --> 31:11.539
What?

31:21.017 --> 31:22.891
Fluid flubber...

31:23.019 --> 31:26.353
with a convenient
spray applicator.

31:27.899 --> 31:29.892
It`s clogged. Hmm.

31:38.410 --> 31:41.245
- You seen enough?
- Plenty.

31:43.499 --> 31:47.544
All right, after the bowling
ball hits, we break for the car.

31:49.046 --> 31:51.716
Oh, wait a minute.
You can adjust it.

31:55.553 --> 31:57.712
Go!

32:27.462 --> 32:29.371
Oh, damn! Oh!

32:31.216 --> 32:33.375
- Yes! Weebo?
- Yes, sir?

32:33.468 --> 32:35.710
- It`s gonna work.
- I hope so.

32:35.804 --> 32:38.176
Now, let me show you how.

32:39.600 --> 32:42.684
I connected the accelerator
to a sliding shutter.

32:42.812 --> 32:45.766
If I press down on the accelerator,
it releases the gamma rays,

32:45.856 --> 32:47.814
and that increases the thrust.

32:47.942 --> 32:50.777
Ah. Listen to that baby chirp.

32:50.903 --> 32:54.736
Now, the steering wheel
controls lateral motion.

32:54.824 --> 32:56.864
- Mm-hmm.
- If you turn right,

32:56.993 --> 32:58.867
- Okay.
- it`ll steer right.

32:58.995 --> 33:02.162
- Ah! Turns right.
- Turn the wheel left, it steers left.

33:02.290 --> 33:05.292
So, it functions a lot like
a normal automatic shift...

33:05.377 --> 33:07.666
- with drive, park, neutral, reverse.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.

33:07.796 --> 33:10.632
- It`s that easy. See, Weebo?
- Professor!

33:10.716 --> 33:12.958
- Weebo?
- Help! Let me out!

33:13.094 --> 33:15.419
- Oh, Weebo!
- Professor!

33:15.513 --> 33:17.589
- Oh!
- What were you doing in there?

33:17.682 --> 33:20.967
- Flirting with the alternator.
- Hope you didn`t touch anything.

33:21.060 --> 33:24.679
It`s not the time to play. We`re about
to make a major breakthrough.

33:24.814 --> 33:27.602
Okay, here we go.

33:27.692 --> 33:30.397
Yeah. I think we`re ready.

33:31.530 --> 33:33.653
- Weebo?
- Yes?

33:33.740 --> 33:37.608
What do you say
we take her for a ride?

33:37.703 --> 33:40.657
- Fly me to the moon!
- That`s it. That`s the spirit.

33:40.748 --> 33:43.951
We`ll fly over to Sara`s house,
park this baby on the roof,

33:44.043 --> 33:45.952
and then maybe she`s
gonna change her tune.

33:46.045 --> 33:48.619
You know, maybe you should
just go without me.

33:48.715 --> 33:51.336
- Why?
- Because I get carsick.

33:51.426 --> 33:53.465
- Oh, come on.
You`re not gonna blow chips.
- No?

33:53.553 --> 33:55.676
- You don`t have a stomach.
- I have a queasy gyro.

33:55.805 --> 33:59.934
Now get over it. This is not
about cars. This is about Sara.

34:00.060 --> 34:04.010
- Now get in here.
- No!

34:04.106 --> 34:06.015
- Now.
- All right.

34:07.401 --> 34:10.687
Oh! We`re fine now.

34:10.779 --> 34:13.187
- Ah! Out into the world.
- Okay, here we go.

34:13.324 --> 34:16.907
Look at this! Let`s see
what this baby will do!

34:19.580 --> 34:21.953
Oh! It works!

34:22.083 --> 34:24.040
- Yes, it does.
- I`m psyched!

34:24.127 --> 34:27.710
Oh, boy.

34:27.839 --> 34:29.713
- You know what this means, Weebo?
- What?

34:29.841 --> 34:32.545
I`ll never have
to buy tyres again.

34:32.636 --> 34:35.092
Ah. Let`s see what`s
on the radio, Weebo.

34:35.222 --> 34:38.674
Ho! Latin!
Bam ba-bum, ba-bum, ba-bum

34:38.766 --> 34:42.053
Bum ba-bum ba-bum
Hey!

34:42.146 --> 34:44.103
Bum-bum be-bum bum

34:53.241 --> 34:55.732
Right turn.

34:55.827 --> 34:58.401
Whoa! Yes!

34:58.497 --> 35:01.913
Huh? Huh? Oh!

35:04.628 --> 35:07.166
Ah! We`re fine.

35:09.884 --> 35:11.960
Whoa! Oh.

35:12.094 --> 35:16.507
- It`s all right. I saw it.
- I don`t think so.

35:16.641 --> 35:18.930
Weebo, there is
nothing to worry about.

35:21.354 --> 35:23.762
Oh-- Mayday!

35:26.860 --> 35:28.520
Come on. Easy.

35:31.990 --> 35:36.451
Oh! Sorry.
First-time flyer. Shh!

35:56.141 --> 35:58.893
I`m very sorry!

35:59.019 --> 36:02.602
Hang on, Weebo!
Oh! Ha, ha, ha! Oh!

36:02.689 --> 36:06.141
Whoa! Oh! Oh, Weebo!

36:06.276 --> 36:08.316
Oh, now, we`re cookin`!

36:08.404 --> 36:10.313
Whoa!

36:14.827 --> 36:19.240
Oh!

36:21.876 --> 36:23.750
Oh! Yes!

36:30.552 --> 36:33.008
Oh, Weebo. Come on up.

36:33.096 --> 36:35.552
Please. You`ve gotta see this.

36:36.850 --> 36:40.184
Wow! ls this
what you call heaven?

36:40.271 --> 36:43.640
Almost. Look at it.

36:45.026 --> 36:47.861
The whole world below
and beyond.

36:47.987 --> 36:50.561
- It`s beautiful.
- The solitude up here.

36:50.698 --> 36:54.032
The stillness.

36:54.160 --> 36:56.118
- The silence.
- Uh-oh.

37:02.753 --> 37:06.039
Silly me turned it off.
Turns right back on.

37:06.131 --> 37:08.967
The shutter`s jammed probably,
Weebo. We`re okay.

37:12.680 --> 37:15.883
Start right up.
Oh, please turn over!

37:19.020 --> 37:21.309
For the love of Newton,
turn over!

37:23.692 --> 37:25.768
Abandon ship!

37:27.028 --> 37:30.896
Oh!

37:30.991 --> 37:33.067
Yes!

37:40.292 --> 37:42.166
It`s such a pleasure
to spend time with you...

37:42.295 --> 37:44.501
without having Brainard
hovering above us.

37:44.630 --> 37:46.504
Mmm.

37:46.632 --> 37:49.966
- More wine?
- No. No, thank you.

37:50.094 --> 37:52.004
I have to say good night.

37:52.138 --> 37:54.427
I have a busy,
busy day tomorrow.

37:58.478 --> 38:00.554
Mmm.

38:00.647 --> 38:03.814
Rutland would die to have you.

38:03.942 --> 38:07.146
We`d be together
with nothing but time.

38:13.744 --> 38:15.784
Sara?

38:20.001 --> 38:22.124
Mmm.

38:27.217 --> 38:29.423
I`m sorry, Wilson.

38:29.511 --> 38:33.841
Forget it. It`s okay.
We have lots of time.

38:33.974 --> 38:38.802
Listen, l`m-l`m driving up
on Thursday to Rutland for the game.

38:38.896 --> 38:42.265
- I`ll see you there.
- Should I make dinner reservations?

38:42.358 --> 38:45.063
Since Rutland is going
to lose, l`ll pay.

38:45.194 --> 38:48.361
All right. If your team wins,
you can buy me dinner.

38:48.489 --> 38:51.526
If your team loses, we go up to
the mountains for the weekend.

38:53.036 --> 38:57.912
- Mmm--
- Cad!

38:59.459 --> 39:03.160
- Do we have a bet?
- I`ll think about it.

39:08.260 --> 39:10.253
I can`t lose. She`s mine!

39:10.388 --> 39:12.676
Sir lsaac.

39:16.269 --> 39:18.178
Out!

39:22.275 --> 39:24.897
All right.

39:25.028 --> 39:28.860
One more time. What happened?

39:28.991 --> 39:31.945
He took a golf ball,
he rubbed this cream on it,

39:32.077 --> 39:35.612
and then the golf ball
took off and...

39:35.748 --> 39:37.622
popped Smith in the head.

39:37.750 --> 39:39.873
- Several times.
- Mm-hmm.

39:39.960 --> 39:44.706
- I got hit with a bowling ball.
- Repeatedly.

39:44.841 --> 39:48.210
- Were you drinking?
- No.

39:48.344 --> 39:51.511
Two beers at dinner.
Wesson had a white wine.

39:51.598 --> 39:53.721
- With dinner.
- Right.

39:55.143 --> 39:58.595
It`s this stuff
he`s got, sir. It`s--

39:58.730 --> 40:01.897
I don`t know what it is. I don`t
know where it comes from, but...

40:06.780 --> 40:09.616
it will give you
one heck of a headache.

40:09.742 --> 40:13.325
Oh, goodness.

40:14.956 --> 40:17.198
I-l wish I could
make you feel better.

40:17.292 --> 40:20.625
Hmm. So do l.

40:20.754 --> 40:24.004
Well, maybe l`m old-fashioned,
but I believe...

40:24.132 --> 40:26.421
a woman should love a man
for what he is,

40:26.551 --> 40:29.256
and not for what
she wants him to be.

40:30.556 --> 40:32.762
Thanks for the
sentiment, Weebo, but...

40:32.891 --> 40:36.724
this is really not an area you`re
qualified to offer perspective on.

40:36.812 --> 40:40.098
Well, I don`t have much of
a smile, but I do have a brain.

40:41.275 --> 40:43.766
I have to deal with this alone.

40:43.903 --> 40:45.777
It`s a human matter,

40:45.905 --> 40:47.981
not for computers.

40:48.116 --> 40:50.572
It`s for people.

40:50.660 --> 40:53.780
- Good night, Weebo.
- Good night, Professor.

42:36.188 --> 42:38.062
Hmm.

42:54.916 --> 42:57.490
- I got it!
- Oh, no!

42:59.713 --> 43:02.917
I gotta turn this thing off.
This is so embarrassing.

43:03.050 --> 43:06.419
Weebo, I just had
this amazing dream!

43:06.512 --> 43:09.003
- Weebo!
- Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!

43:10.016 --> 43:13.183
Weebo! Weebo!

43:13.311 --> 43:15.849
- Weebo! Wake up!
- Mmm.

43:18.525 --> 43:22.523
- I`ve solved all our problems.
- I`m all ears.

43:22.654 --> 43:27.115
Flubber is going
to the basketball game.

43:27.201 --> 43:29.608
- Basketball?
- Yes!

44:02.571 --> 44:04.481
Testing, testing.

44:23.802 --> 44:26.174
Applying a thin layer
of fluid flubber...

44:26.263 --> 44:28.932
to synthetic leather surface
of basketball.

44:30.934 --> 44:33.058
Application complete.

44:49.829 --> 44:51.739
Wow!

44:55.168 --> 44:56.711
Oops.

44:59.423 --> 45:01.297
Two points.

45:15.940 --> 45:18.562
Implementing plan "B."

45:18.693 --> 45:21.564
Very tight. Tight.

45:21.696 --> 45:24.532
And careful, careful,
careful, careful.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.909
Secondary flubber experiment.

45:35.002 --> 45:37.328
Control elements: bungee cord,

45:37.463 --> 45:41.413
three-to-one elasticity ratio,
fifty-pound ballast.

45:41.509 --> 45:43.917
Commencing now.

45:44.012 --> 45:45.921
Wish me luck.

45:47.265 --> 45:50.800
Oh! Whoa!

45:52.604 --> 45:54.811
Yes!

45:54.940 --> 45:57.146
Ha, ha!

45:57.276 --> 46:00.976
Whoa! I got it!

46:05.326 --> 46:08.695
Oh! Bungee! Bungee!

46:08.830 --> 46:10.703
Oh! Oh!

46:10.832 --> 46:13.157
Uh, help.

46:13.293 --> 46:15.451
Uh, yeow!

46:29.351 --> 46:31.261
It worked!

46:32.938 --> 46:35.061
Yes!

46:35.191 --> 46:37.065
End test.

46:45.368 --> 46:49.496
Did you fully fix the flubber
on each tack before we painted?

46:49.581 --> 46:52.452
Excuse me, Darth Vader,
but what did you say?

46:52.542 --> 46:56.540
Did you fully fix a 15%
flubber solution to each tack
before Weber started painting?

46:56.672 --> 46:59.542
- Yes, l`m positive.
- Excellent.

46:59.675 --> 47:02.000
And how long does it take
the paint to wear off?

47:02.136 --> 47:04.461
- Uh, 30 minutes.
- Be a little suspicious...

47:04.555 --> 47:06.512
if the flubber started
working immediately.

47:06.641 --> 47:10.686
- Uh, isn`t this cheating?
- No, it`s not cheating.
It`s equalizing.

47:10.812 --> 47:13.219
You`ve seen the team. They
should have their own telethon.

47:13.356 --> 47:15.515
Come on! We`ve got
to win this game.

47:15.650 --> 47:18.604
I`ve gotta do it to prove to
Sara that flubber really works.

47:18.737 --> 47:22.604
I`m gonna do it right under
Wilson Croft`s nose.

47:22.741 --> 47:24.615
Don`t fail me.

47:35.546 --> 47:37.171
- Weebo.
- Yes?

47:37.256 --> 47:39.498
- While l`m out, you`re in charge, okay?
- Okay.

47:39.592 --> 47:42.048
- No phone calls to Russia again.
- I think that was Weber.

47:42.136 --> 47:46.549
Oh! Make sure the flubber
stays in the tank.

47:46.683 --> 47:49.091
- Got it.
- Under no circumstances
are you to release it.

47:49.227 --> 47:51.101
- Of course.
- Because you know what would happen.

47:51.229 --> 47:54.729
- Ho, ho, ho.
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir, I understand.

47:54.858 --> 47:58.274
- Promise?
- Have no fear.

47:58.404 --> 48:01.358
That`s my girl.

48:01.449 --> 48:05.233
Go Medfield!

48:05.369 --> 48:07.611
Okay.

48:07.830 --> 48:10.915
Good evening, everybody,
and welcome to Rutland Arena...

48:11.042 --> 48:14.079
for the 86th meeting of the Rutland
Rangers and the Medfield Squirrels.

48:14.212 --> 48:16.418
Rutland, if they can just
stay awake, should be able...

48:16.506 --> 48:18.665
to steamroll the Squirrels
here tonight at the--

48:18.800 --> 48:21.089
All right, Squirrels,

48:21.178 --> 48:24.381
Iisten up here now.

48:24.473 --> 48:28.886
Okay, Rutland may have us
in height and reach,

48:28.978 --> 48:31.350
weight and power,

48:31.480 --> 48:33.639
agility, speed and talent.

48:33.774 --> 48:36.775
They have the advantage
on offence...

48:36.903 --> 48:39.145
and defence.

48:39.280 --> 48:42.115
Sure, they`re-they`re
better coached,

48:42.200 --> 48:44.193
better trained,

48:44.327 --> 48:49.618
and their will to win is
unmatched in the conference.

48:49.708 --> 48:52.377
They`re undefeated
in their last...

48:52.502 --> 48:56.417
one hundred and eight games.

48:56.507 --> 49:00.754
But that doesn`t mean we can`t
whip these guys. Right?

49:16.778 --> 49:18.985
- Yeah!
- Ohh!

49:22.492 --> 49:25.162
Rutland! Rangers!

49:25.287 --> 49:28.573
Rutland! Rangers!

49:41.471 --> 49:44.342
Okay, flubber, it`s time
that you and l...

49:44.432 --> 49:46.342
got to know each other.

49:48.061 --> 49:51.264
Ow!

49:55.402 --> 49:58.024
Another easy basket
for the Rutland Rangers.

49:58.113 --> 50:02.028
They have built up a commanding
lead in the first half.

50:08.875 --> 50:11.081
- Evening, Sara.
- Excuse me?

50:11.211 --> 50:13.536
What a coincidence.

50:18.760 --> 50:21.298
Dunk it! Dunk it!

50:21.430 --> 50:23.387
Take it!

50:26.101 --> 50:28.059
Come on, you guys!
You gotta do--

50:28.187 --> 50:30.476
Not now, Ernie! Not now!

50:30.606 --> 50:32.480
Go Medfield!

50:34.735 --> 50:38.899
- Ow!
- Oh, sorry. Sorry, Wilson.

50:46.456 --> 50:48.579
See if you can get me
another ten grand on Rutland.

50:52.838 --> 50:55.922
- You got a problem, Bennett?
- You`re betting against my team?

50:56.050 --> 50:59.750
It`s not your team. They
threw you off, remember that?

51:04.350 --> 51:06.675
Ooh. Oh, baby.
That`s gotta hurt.

51:06.811 --> 51:09.646
He fouled him!
He threw his hip into that!

51:16.947 --> 51:20.897
Flubber? Flubber!
Where are you?

51:27.708 --> 51:30.199
Mambo

51:38.386 --> 51:40.295
Mambo!

51:42.223 --> 51:44.430
Yeah!

51:44.517 --> 51:49.643
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

51:49.898 --> 51:52.852
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

53:20.953 --> 53:22.826
Yeah!

53:45.562 --> 53:47.436
Yeah!

53:48.982 --> 53:51.770
Welcome back to Rutland Arena
for half number two.

53:51.902 --> 53:55.105
The Medfield Squirrels tonight
are getting their nuts buried,

53:55.239 --> 53:57.564
trailing by 51 at intermission.

53:57.658 --> 54:02.735
If Coach Barker has any sense,
he has to be thinking forfeiture--

54:02.830 --> 54:05.701
...for half number two.

54:05.833 --> 54:07.873
Come on, boys.
Expect the unexpected.

54:08.002 --> 54:10.494
Dale. Come on now, son.
You can do it.

54:10.630 --> 54:13.880
Come on, Bruce. There we go.
Werner, be a flying squirrel!

54:14.009 --> 54:17.460
Bart, the impossible`s possible.
Come on, Lawrence!

54:17.596 --> 54:19.719
- Rodents rule!
- Loser!

54:27.523 --> 54:29.397
Show time.

54:31.360 --> 54:34.112
Keep going! Open!

54:37.033 --> 54:38.907
Oh!

54:49.379 --> 54:51.917
- Yeah! Get `em!
- Come on!
- Defence, defence!

54:54.677 --> 54:58.176
- Come on!
- That`s pretty good.

54:58.264 --> 54:59.888
Yeah!

55:01.559 --> 55:05.177
Okay! Go! Beat them! Let`s go!

55:12.153 --> 55:14.858
Oh!

55:19.995 --> 55:22.202
- Yes! Yes!
- Gosh! We`ve never--

55:22.289 --> 55:26.702
Yeah! Did you see that?
Did you see that, Dad? Yes!

55:32.592 --> 55:34.501
What the--

55:38.723 --> 55:41.510
We did it!

55:41.601 --> 55:43.973
Wow! Wow!

55:44.104 --> 55:47.022
Hey, are you blind? They`re doin`
something illegal out there.

55:47.107 --> 55:50.559
Coach, nowhere in the rule book does
it say anything about jumpin` too high.

55:50.652 --> 55:54.271
Now sit down!

55:54.406 --> 55:57.111
Looks like a lonely weekend
in the mountains for you, Croft.

55:57.243 --> 55:59.235
Come on, Squirrels!

56:11.800 --> 56:14.635
Yea!

56:14.761 --> 56:17.134
Did you see that, Croft?

56:23.812 --> 56:25.852
Down, down!

56:29.318 --> 56:31.276
Yes!

56:35.408 --> 56:37.282
Yeah, yeah!

56:44.668 --> 56:46.577
A tack.

56:53.385 --> 56:55.959
Oh. Dale!

56:56.055 --> 56:58.297
No!

56:58.432 --> 57:01.303
Dale! Not the tacks!

57:01.436 --> 57:04.306
- I don`t know.
- Okay, now, this game is not over yet.

57:04.439 --> 57:06.728
You just wanna steal the ball
and then score!

57:06.858 --> 57:08.767
Pardon me, boys.
Educator coming through.

57:08.860 --> 57:12.110
Coach, I know very little about
basketball, but I do know chemistry.

57:12.197 --> 57:15.151
And l-l believe that Dale is having
a problem, not with motivations,

57:15.242 --> 57:17.994
but with some sort of adhesive buildup
on the bottom of his shoes.

57:18.078 --> 57:20.783
- Do you have any ethyl alcohol?
- What?

57:20.873 --> 57:23.660
- Excuse me. Hello, Dale.
- Coach.
- Oh, hello, Professor Brainard.

57:23.751 --> 57:25.909
- May I see your sole?
- Wh--

57:26.045 --> 57:29.496
- I mean, the bottom of your shoe.
- Oh, oh.

57:29.632 --> 57:33.760
Now, the game`s not over yet. Keep your
chin up and your potential energy high.

57:33.886 --> 57:36.175
`Cause you know why, Dale?

57:37.140 --> 57:39.927
Son of a--

57:40.060 --> 57:43.559
Get the ball.
Jump with all your soul.

57:43.688 --> 57:45.598
B-- But l`m
on this end, sir. I--

57:45.732 --> 57:47.725
Jump! Or l`ll flunk you.

57:47.860 --> 57:50.351
- Uh-- What?
- You heard me.

57:50.487 --> 57:54.320
Jump, or l`ll flunk you out
of my department for good.

57:55.743 --> 57:57.652
Okay.

57:59.956 --> 58:02.032
I think that`s
a little harsh, but--

58:02.125 --> 58:05.375
- Jump!
- A-T-T-A-C-K!

58:05.503 --> 58:09.122
The Medfield Squirrels are trying
to complete this astonishing comeback.

58:09.257 --> 58:13.966
- Nice and patient, Rutland.
Plenty of time, baby.
- Rutland has the lead
with the clock winding down.

58:14.096 --> 58:16.551
These rodents have fought
their little hearts out tonight,

58:16.640 --> 58:20.223
but it looks like the Squirrels
are gonna come up a couple
of nuts short of a bushel.

58:20.310 --> 58:23.228
Playing keep-away are the Rangers.
Here`s a wide-open "J" by Hatch.

58:23.314 --> 58:25.223
Jump, Dale! Jump!

58:26.984 --> 58:29.392
Jepner is soaring
into the air, makes the steal.

58:29.529 --> 58:33.573
Look at him go! Jepner, with wings
on his shoes, soaring to the other end!

58:33.658 --> 58:36.066
He`s all over it.
He dives. He`s through!

58:36.202 --> 58:40.070
And Medfield upsets Rutland
on an incredible play by Dale Jepner!

58:40.207 --> 58:42.246
- No!
- And the Squirrels are going nuts.

58:42.334 --> 58:44.742
- Yeah!
- We won!
- Oh, we did it!
- Foul!

58:44.878 --> 58:47.120
- We did it!
- Foul! Foul!

58:47.256 --> 58:50.921
Since when is it within the
rules for a player to accompany
the ball through the hoop?

58:51.051 --> 58:54.302
Oh, I don`t know. Come on.
I owe you dinner.

58:55.639 --> 58:58.261
- Sara?
- Good night, Phillip.

58:58.351 --> 59:00.343
Good night.

59:03.398 --> 59:05.936
Brainard had something
to do with this.

59:06.025 --> 59:09.893
It-lt`s the same stuff we saw
the other night over at his house.

59:09.988 --> 59:11.613
Right.

59:14.493 --> 59:18.621
I don`t know how, but l`m absolutely
certain your team cheated.

59:18.706 --> 59:20.994
Oh, you`re just being
a sore loser.

59:21.125 --> 59:25.419
Sara, m-m-may I speak
to you for a moment? Alone?

59:25.504 --> 59:28.078
What you have to say to her,
you can say to both of us,

59:28.174 --> 59:30.747
if you can remember.

59:30.843 --> 59:32.801
Sara?

59:33.930 --> 59:36.635
- Flubber.
- Flubber?

59:36.725 --> 59:39.394
Sounds like baby shampoo.

59:42.272 --> 59:44.431
Flubber is what won the game.

59:44.524 --> 59:46.731
That amazing aerial ballet...

59:46.860 --> 59:49.398
was because I flubberized
the boys` shoes.

59:49.530 --> 59:52.815
A little on the bottom-- Whoo!

59:52.950 --> 59:56.284
You are remarkable.

59:59.707 --> 01:00:01.664
Sara?

01:00:01.793 --> 01:00:04.498
Good night, Phillip.

01:00:04.587 --> 01:00:07.125
Watch yourself.

01:00:08.633 --> 01:00:11.504
Now what do we have to do
to get you to take a hint?

01:00:11.636 --> 01:00:13.510
It`s over, Phillip. You lost.

01:00:13.639 --> 01:00:16.046
Go home. Play with your rubber.

01:00:45.672 --> 01:00:49.006
What kind of car does
that Brainard fellow drive?

01:00:49.093 --> 01:00:51.880
Old T-Bird. Why?

01:00:52.012 --> 01:00:55.512
- I just saw it.
- So?

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:58.007
It was flying.

01:00:59.645 --> 01:01:02.730
You heard me. Flying.

01:01:11.116 --> 01:01:13.524
- Hey, who won?
- We did.

01:01:14.912 --> 01:01:17.403
Um, Professor,

01:01:17.498 --> 01:01:19.787
why the long face?

01:01:21.919 --> 01:01:27.424
- I think you know why.
- Would it be a Sara issue?

01:01:29.343 --> 01:01:31.751
Wish I understood human beings.

01:01:33.181 --> 01:01:36.348
Wish I understood women.

01:01:36.476 --> 01:01:40.260
Wish I understood emotions and passions.
I wish I understood any of that.

01:01:40.397 --> 01:01:44.264
If I did, I wouldn`t have had to spend
my entire life in a laboratory...

01:01:44.401 --> 01:01:46.524
trying to figure out
how the world works.

01:01:46.653 --> 01:01:49.524
I would`ve been out in the world
trying to figure out why it works.

01:01:53.494 --> 01:01:55.570
I know I love her, Weebo.

01:01:57.748 --> 01:02:01.283
Every neuron in my limbic system
is saturated with phenylethylamine.

01:02:01.419 --> 01:02:05.464
That triggers euphoria,
elation, exhilaration.

01:02:05.590 --> 01:02:07.666
Truth is, Weebo,

01:02:07.801 --> 01:02:11.846
I`m not absent-minded because
l`m selfish or crazy or--

01:02:11.972 --> 01:02:14.926
or inconsiderate.

01:02:15.017 --> 01:02:17.472
I`m absent-minded because l`m
in love with Sara.

01:02:17.603 --> 01:02:19.477
Oh, Professor.

01:02:20.898 --> 01:02:23.471
That doesn`t matter any more,

01:02:24.860 --> 01:02:27.482
`cause I don`t get
any more chances with her.

01:02:27.613 --> 01:02:31.825
That`s not true. There`s always another
chance. I mean, you never know, right?

01:02:31.951 --> 01:02:33.944
Probably just as well
that it`s over.

01:02:34.037 --> 01:02:37.620
- Why?
- She has to move on.

01:02:37.707 --> 01:02:40.377
- Oh.
- I`m not right for her.

01:02:40.502 --> 01:02:42.661
- But you knew that, didn`t you, Weebo?
- Huh?

01:02:42.796 --> 01:02:45.501
You never wanted me
to marry her.

01:02:46.842 --> 01:02:50.710
Well, you were right.
I wasn`t right for her.

01:02:50.846 --> 01:02:53.847
You`re the one for me, Weebo.

01:02:53.933 --> 01:02:55.926
Just the two of us.

01:02:57.061 --> 01:02:59.350
And flubber makes three.

01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:03.645
- Good night, Weeb.
- Good night.

01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:07.194
Uh, Professor--

01:03:12.744 --> 01:03:14.784
And this is the God`s truth:

01:03:14.913 --> 01:03:17.665
I want him to have
what he wants,

01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:20.502
even if it means you
instead of me.

01:03:41.650 --> 01:03:43.559
Ooh!

01:03:55.373 --> 01:03:59.074
Sara? Sara, it`s me.

01:03:59.210 --> 01:04:02.081
- Weebo?
- May I come in?

01:04:02.172 --> 01:04:04.745
Oh, l`m sorry
to wake you like this,

01:04:04.883 --> 01:04:09.047
but I can`t ring the doorbell.

01:04:09.137 --> 01:04:11.593
- Is everything okay with Phillip?
- Oh, yeah.

01:04:11.723 --> 01:04:14.475
It`s not
a conventional emergency.

01:04:14.601 --> 01:04:18.434
Oh, Phillip would be very angry
if he knew I left,

01:04:18.564 --> 01:04:20.853
but I have
to show you something.

01:04:20.983 --> 01:04:23.439
Do you have a minute?

01:04:23.527 --> 01:04:25.567
Listen.

01:04:25.655 --> 01:04:29.783
I know I love her, Weebo.

01:04:29.909 --> 01:04:33.444
Every neuron in my limbic system
is saturated with phenylethylamine.

01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:37.364
That triggers euphoria,
elation, exhilaration.

01:04:37.501 --> 01:04:40.704
Truth is, Weebo, l`m not absent-minded
because l`m selfish...

01:04:40.837 --> 01:04:44.538
or crazy or-- or inconsiderate.

01:04:46.010 --> 01:04:48.964
I`m absent-minded because l`m
in love with Sara.

01:04:49.096 --> 01:04:50.970
Oh.

01:04:56.521 --> 01:04:59.226
And this will be
our little secret.

01:05:11.370 --> 01:05:13.991
Phillip.

01:05:18.878 --> 01:05:20.787
Oh.

01:05:22.632 --> 01:05:25.633
- Sara?
- Uh-huh.

01:05:46.198 --> 01:05:49.484
This is it.
This is the solution.

01:05:49.577 --> 01:05:52.946
This is how we save the school.

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:55.916
That`s what l`ve been saying.
Flubber.

01:05:56.042 --> 01:05:58.331
- You saw what it did at the game.
- Yes.

01:05:58.419 --> 01:06:00.329
Imagine the line of shoes
we could develop.

01:06:00.421 --> 01:06:02.628
Oh, no, no, no, Phillip,
not shoes.

01:06:02.757 --> 01:06:04.797
No. Look.

01:06:04.926 --> 01:06:07.382
This. Flight.

01:06:08.597 --> 01:06:09.925
- Flight?
- Yes.

01:06:10.057 --> 01:06:12.215
- Oh, of course.
- A-Air travel.

01:06:12.309 --> 01:06:14.302
Oh, Sara! Air travel.

01:06:14.436 --> 01:06:16.228
- Yes.
- Oh.

01:06:16.355 --> 01:06:19.890
- We`d better sell this
to a car company.
- Oh, Phillip.

01:06:35.667 --> 01:06:38.158
- Hey!
- Dr Reynolds.

01:06:38.295 --> 01:06:41.830
Professor. It`s a pleasure
to finally meet you.

01:06:43.342 --> 01:06:45.750
I believe you know my son.

01:06:45.844 --> 01:06:48.762
He used to play basketball
for Medfield.

01:06:50.141 --> 01:06:52.714
Lovely old car.

01:06:52.810 --> 01:06:56.014
Mind if I take a look
under the hood?

01:06:56.147 --> 01:06:58.721
Yes, I do.

01:06:58.816 --> 01:07:03.526
And I don`t appreciate you gentlemen
letting yourselves onto my property.

01:07:03.655 --> 01:07:07.867
I expected something
more complex.

01:07:07.993 --> 01:07:11.742
There`s a lot of money
in your discovery.

01:07:11.830 --> 01:07:14.119
Perhaps we could make a deal.

01:07:15.918 --> 01:07:19.038
Any discovery I make will belong
to Medfield College.

01:07:19.171 --> 01:07:22.256
At the end of the term there isn`t
going to be a Medfield College.

01:07:22.341 --> 01:07:26.042
- We`ll see about that.
- You could make a lot of money.

01:07:28.264 --> 01:07:32.214
If we were interested in making money,
we wouldn`t have become teachers.

01:07:32.352 --> 01:07:35.139
You think you`ll be able to sell
it for what you owe me...

01:07:35.230 --> 01:07:37.187
by the end of the term?

01:07:37.315 --> 01:07:39.308
We-- We will.

01:07:39.443 --> 01:07:43.275
I`ll forget the debt right now.

01:07:43.364 --> 01:07:46.483
No, l`m not selling.

01:07:46.617 --> 01:07:50.152
When I leave,
I take my offer with me.

01:07:50.288 --> 01:07:53.454
We understand.

01:07:53.541 --> 01:07:55.450
Good luck.

01:07:58.755 --> 01:08:00.961
Come on.

01:08:01.049 --> 01:08:02.958
Watch your back, smart guy.

01:08:03.051 --> 01:08:05.210
Bad move, Professor.

01:08:18.234 --> 01:08:20.143
Good morning!

01:08:23.656 --> 01:08:25.696
Pardon me, Mr Seldon.

01:08:25.825 --> 01:08:28.696
Are you interested in seeing
a Phillip Brainard?

01:08:28.787 --> 01:08:33.412
- Who?
- He`s the college professor
you spoke to on the sixth...

01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:35.618
about a brand-new car design.

01:08:35.752 --> 01:08:38.956
Tell him l`m busy.
Thank him for the interest.

01:08:39.089 --> 01:08:42.209
- And send him a hat.
- Well, he`s here.

01:08:42.341 --> 01:08:46.008
He`s right outside.

01:09:04.073 --> 01:09:07.075
It`s one of the rarest looks
in watches you can actually own.

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:09.448
This watch we have here
is called the scarab.

01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:11.488
It has Swiss--

01:09:13.626 --> 01:09:15.997
Good night, Weber.

01:09:31.810 --> 01:09:34.100
What?

01:09:57.881 --> 01:09:59.957
One goon.

01:10:01.801 --> 01:10:04.637
Two goons.

01:10:28.037 --> 01:10:29.995
- Hey.
- What?

01:10:30.081 --> 01:10:33.248
- I think I found it.
- You found it, all right!

01:10:40.050 --> 01:10:43.502
- What was that?
- Take two.

01:11:01.156 --> 01:11:04.192
Knock, knock!

01:11:18.007 --> 01:11:19.881
Kiss me, big boy!

01:11:33.857 --> 01:11:36.728
Did you get it?

01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:38.734
Yeah.

01:11:50.750 --> 01:11:54.084
Oh, l-l`ve never seen
so many zeroes.

01:11:54.212 --> 01:11:57.248
When they saw us flying,
they couldn`t wait to write the cheque.

01:11:57.340 --> 01:12:00.010
This will save the school,
Phillip.

01:12:16.861 --> 01:12:18.770
Weebo?

01:12:23.993 --> 01:12:25.903
Weebo?

01:12:33.545 --> 01:12:36.250
They took the flubber.

01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:38.878
Weebo?

01:12:47.226 --> 01:12:49.515
- Weeb--
- Oh.

01:12:49.645 --> 01:12:52.315
Um, sh-she`s leaking
battery fluid.

01:12:54.025 --> 01:12:56.563
Weebo, it`s me.

01:13:00.323 --> 01:13:04.238
Do you have signal?
Do you have audio signal?

01:13:04.369 --> 01:13:07.323
Tracking. It`s me.
Professor Brainard.

01:13:07.414 --> 01:13:10.534
Focus. Weebo?

01:13:10.668 --> 01:13:13.159
Can you see me?

01:13:14.714 --> 01:13:17.584
She sees me.

01:13:19.635 --> 01:13:22.209
Weebo.

01:13:22.347 --> 01:13:25.597
It`s all right. I`ve-l`ve-- I need
to get some sort of extension cord,

01:13:25.725 --> 01:13:28.395
something so I can recharge her.

01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:31.011
I`ve gotta-- I`ve gotta
download her, quick.

01:13:31.148 --> 01:13:33.187
Weebo?

01:13:33.275 --> 01:13:35.647
It`s all right. It`s okay.

01:13:35.736 --> 01:13:39.187
Weebo, can you hear me?

01:13:43.119 --> 01:13:45.823
It`s gonna be all right.

01:13:45.913 --> 01:13:49.863
It`s like that time you ran into
the wall when I first made you.

01:13:49.959 --> 01:13:52.533
We`ll get you upstairs,
onto AC and--

01:13:54.881 --> 01:13:57.039
She`s-She`s losing--

01:13:57.133 --> 01:14:01.712
She`s losing power.
It`s okay. It`s all right.

01:14:01.847 --> 01:14:04.053
We just gotta get you
to the docking station...

01:14:04.182 --> 01:14:06.887
till I can make repairs.

01:14:14.443 --> 01:14:16.317
Weebo?

01:14:20.700 --> 01:14:23.072
Goodbye, my friend.

01:14:32.129 --> 01:14:35.083
Gone. I have no idea what--

01:14:36.425 --> 01:14:38.299
Goodbye.

01:15:00.742 --> 01:15:02.949
I don`t know what
to do with her.

01:15:05.831 --> 01:15:09.247
What happens to the soul
of a machine, Sara?

01:15:13.297 --> 01:15:15.835
Can you fix her?

01:15:15.967 --> 01:15:18.505
I can make repairs,

01:15:18.636 --> 01:15:22.088
but I can never bring back
the life it was she had.

01:15:22.181 --> 01:15:24.969
That`s gone.

01:15:25.101 --> 01:15:28.684
I never knew what it was to begin with.
It was some sort of glorious accident.

01:15:28.813 --> 01:15:33.808
I kept trying to recreate it
and isolate it and find out what it was.

01:15:33.902 --> 01:15:36.310
I never could.

01:15:37.948 --> 01:15:40.902
What was that word
she was displaying...

01:15:41.035 --> 01:15:43.704
on her screen at the end?

01:15:43.829 --> 01:15:46.403
Probably a file name.

01:15:46.541 --> 01:15:48.699
Why was she displaying it?

01:15:48.835 --> 01:15:52.370
She was damaged-- It`s, you know--
download-- random piece of information.

01:15:52.505 --> 01:15:54.664
- I don`t know.
- What was that word?

01:15:56.551 --> 01:15:59.007
Oh, can you remember?

01:15:59.137 --> 01:16:01.628
No, l--

01:16:01.723 --> 01:16:04.677
- Try.
- I am.

01:16:10.107 --> 01:16:12.183
It began with "S."

01:16:19.784 --> 01:16:23.996
Hello, Phillip. It`s me. Weebo.

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:26.750
If I was human, that is.

01:16:26.875 --> 01:16:30.659
If you`re watching this,
l`m no longer here.

01:16:32.255 --> 01:16:35.506
I hope my demise didn`t
cause you any undue distress.

01:16:36.885 --> 01:16:39.211
Phillip,

01:16:39.305 --> 01:16:43.219
a full and complete design
of me is in this file.

01:16:43.351 --> 01:16:46.720
You didn`t forget it.
I never showed it to you.

01:16:47.980 --> 01:16:50.602
I`ve made a few changes.

01:16:50.733 --> 01:16:53.604
I`ve removed a few
of my flaws...

01:16:55.030 --> 01:16:57.521
and added a little of you.

01:16:59.993 --> 01:17:03.243
I hope you that
you can love my daughter...

01:17:03.372 --> 01:17:05.578
as much as I loved you.

01:17:45.374 --> 01:17:46.785
Ooh.

01:17:55.343 --> 01:17:58.380
Surprise, surprise.

01:17:58.513 --> 01:18:01.598
Professor Brainard.
Dr Reynolds.

01:18:01.683 --> 01:18:04.435
Good evening. Sit down.

01:18:07.189 --> 01:18:09.348
You look, uh--

01:18:09.483 --> 01:18:13.433
- Weary.
- Yes. Weary.

01:18:13.529 --> 01:18:15.736
You came to repay your loan?

01:18:15.865 --> 01:18:20.492
- No.
- I know you didn`t. I was
just having a little fun.

01:18:20.578 --> 01:18:22.867
I`m here to sell you
the flubber.

01:18:22.997 --> 01:18:25.749
You been to your house recently?

01:18:25.876 --> 01:18:29.624
- Yes.
- Do I really need to buy it?

01:18:31.298 --> 01:18:33.504
Flubber`s
a very quixotic substance.

01:18:33.634 --> 01:18:38.011
It`s very difficult to handle.
Have you tried to do anything with it?

01:18:38.138 --> 01:18:41.923
My man is working on it.
It won`t be a problem.

01:18:42.059 --> 01:18:45.974
Well, I could make it
a lot easier for you.

01:18:46.063 --> 01:18:48.555
If you give us a 30-day
extension on the loan,

01:18:48.691 --> 01:18:50.649
I`ll tell you everything
I know...

01:18:50.735 --> 01:18:53.736
and make you
a great deal of flubber.

01:18:53.863 --> 01:18:55.940
I`ll give you the 30 days,

01:18:56.074 --> 01:18:59.574
and after that
you give me two years.

01:18:59.703 --> 01:19:03.202
Whatever you come up with
over the next two years is mine.

01:19:03.332 --> 01:19:05.371
That`s not fair!

01:19:05.459 --> 01:19:07.997
Shop somewhere else, lady.

01:19:08.087 --> 01:19:11.041
Sara, Sara. I`ll do it.

01:19:14.385 --> 01:19:19.806
- May I see the flubber?
- Would you like to show these
good people to the library?

01:20:01.143 --> 01:20:04.393
You`re going to enjoy this.
Professor?

01:20:06.190 --> 01:20:08.942
I got you a little help.

01:20:10.778 --> 01:20:16.117
- The lovebirds.
- Wilson. Shame on you.

01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:19.819
- Welcome.
- So you finally gave up teaching.

01:20:19.954 --> 01:20:25.032
How could I pass up the opportunity
to transform the energy industry?

01:20:25.168 --> 01:20:28.833
Flubber. Very interesting, Phil.

01:20:28.964 --> 01:20:31.122
Too bad it`s so unstable.

01:20:31.258 --> 01:20:35.552
I was just looking over the formula.
Dangerous mix.

01:20:35.679 --> 01:20:38.799
You just have to know how to
deal with it, really. It just
takes a few simple precautions--

01:20:38.891 --> 01:20:40.931
Hey, hey. Hang on, "Einsteen."

01:20:41.018 --> 01:20:43.936
- Stein.
- Whatever.

01:20:46.524 --> 01:20:51.945
- What`s this?
- Well, it-it`s a hand cream that
acts as a separating agent.

01:20:52.030 --> 01:20:54.984
- Right.
- Um--

01:20:57.369 --> 01:21:00.323
It`s so I can handle
the flubber.

01:21:00.414 --> 01:21:02.821
- It`s okay.
- Thank you.

01:21:02.916 --> 01:21:07.413
She needs to assist me.
Rub it on your hands.

01:21:14.887 --> 01:21:17.129
It`s a, uh--

01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:22.433
squirt gun.

01:21:22.562 --> 01:21:27.687
- What`s it for?
- I use that to lower
the temperature of the tank.

01:21:27.818 --> 01:21:29.692
Let him have it.

01:21:32.281 --> 01:21:37.026
No, no. Give it to him.
N-No, no. Give it to him.

01:21:37.161 --> 01:21:39.699
W-- Stop that
and give it to him.

01:21:41.082 --> 01:21:43.999
Put-Put it in his hand
and give it to him.

01:21:44.085 --> 01:21:48.379
No, no, no, no, no.
Give the gun to him.

01:21:49.507 --> 01:21:52.081
Oh.

01:21:52.218 --> 01:21:54.211
- Thank you.
- You`re welcome.

01:22:19.414 --> 01:22:22.249
You okay? lt`s me.

01:22:27.756 --> 01:22:30.757
There you go.

01:22:30.884 --> 01:22:33.043
Oh. Shh.

01:22:40.728 --> 01:22:43.266
Do it for Weebo.

01:22:43.398 --> 01:22:45.604
Look out!

01:22:48.319 --> 01:22:50.111
Ooh.

01:22:56.161 --> 01:22:58.237
Get him!

01:23:03.711 --> 01:23:06.581
- Oh, dear.
- Sara? Going somewhere?

01:23:06.672 --> 01:23:08.581
Wilson.

01:23:10.801 --> 01:23:12.628
Ooh.

01:23:18.685 --> 01:23:21.390
Left, left, left,
right, right, left.

01:23:26.193 --> 01:23:28.316
- Sara!
- Huh?
- Grab her.

01:23:28.445 --> 01:23:30.817
- What?
- Jump!

01:23:30.906 --> 01:23:32.899
I`m coming, Sara!

01:23:33.033 --> 01:23:34.991
Yo!

01:23:43.127 --> 01:23:45.500
Ooh!

01:23:50.302 --> 01:23:52.460
Hey, Lumpy. Hmm?

01:23:52.554 --> 01:23:55.010
- Come on.
- Let`s go, smart guy.

01:24:02.982 --> 01:24:06.185
- Ow.
- Phillip, look out!

01:24:17.330 --> 01:24:19.204
Sara!

01:24:21.793 --> 01:24:24.165
- Get him.
- This one`s for Weebo.

01:24:37.101 --> 01:24:38.975
Ooh.

01:24:57.664 --> 01:24:59.574
Oh, Mommy--

01:25:12.597 --> 01:25:15.266
Wow.

01:25:24.401 --> 01:25:26.892
Oh.

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.873
Beautiful.

01:25:42.754 --> 01:25:45.838
For as much as these
two people have finally...

01:25:45.965 --> 01:25:48.587
consented together
in holy wedlock...

01:25:48.677 --> 01:25:53.137
and have witnessed the same
before God and this company,

01:25:53.265 --> 01:25:56.598
I pronounce, believe it or not,

01:25:56.685 --> 01:26:00.517
that they be
husband and wife together.

01:26:00.648 --> 01:26:03.898
- You may now kiss the video screen.
- Oh.

01:26:12.285 --> 01:26:14.242
Love you, Sara.

01:26:15.622 --> 01:26:17.496
I love you.

01:26:21.878 --> 01:26:27.086
I`ll meet you at the reception. I`m
almost done. It`s gonna be remarkable.

01:26:27.217 --> 01:26:29.424
Phillip, please be careful.

01:26:29.553 --> 01:26:33.136
Don`t worry. These chemicals
are completely compatible.

01:26:33.224 --> 01:26:37.767
There`s no chance
that anything could go wrong!

01:26:53.245 --> 01:26:57.706
Hey, pal. We`re 30,000 feet
up in the air.

01:26:57.791 --> 01:27:01.374
There`s no monsters or bad guys
way up here, okay?

01:27:01.503 --> 01:27:03.876
You can look out the window.

01:27:21.858 --> 01:27:23.898
Mom. Mom!

01:27:23.986 --> 01:27:27.568
Flubber`s gone. Get back here!

01:27:32.828 --> 01:27:35.402
When we get to the hotel,
I don`t care what you say,

01:27:35.539 --> 01:27:37.746
I`m not sharing a room with him.

01:27:37.875 --> 01:27:40.580
Look at him. He`s gross.
He bounces all the time.

01:27:40.712 --> 01:27:42.918
He squeaks. He phase-shifts.

01:27:43.006 --> 01:27:45.129
I mean, he`s a quasi-plasmoid.

01:27:45.258 --> 01:27:47.500
If it`s hot in Hawaii,
I hope he melts.

01:27:52.432 --> 01:27:54.425
Ow
