01:07.567 --> 01:10.487
[breathing heavily]

01:27.837 --> 01:30.089
High Priestess, you're needed.

01:39.974 --> 01:42.727
[screaming]

01:42.852 --> 01:44.521
[groaning]

01:47.565 --> 01:50.485
Why hide the identity
of those who attacked your base?

01:50.610 --> 01:52.112
Give us the information.

01:52.821 --> 01:55.949
I'm telling you, it must have been Lotor.

01:56.074 --> 01:58.827
[screaming]

01:58.952 --> 02:01.788
He appears to have no ability
to recall what happened.

02:01.913 --> 02:05.542
No one can completely wipe
a memory away.

02:05.667 --> 02:10.170
There are always remnants
deep within to claw out.

02:12.465 --> 02:14.008
[sighs]

02:14.884 --> 02:17.262
Why would Prince Lotor attack a base

02:17.387 --> 02:20.974
when he could walk in
and take whatever he desires?

02:21.891 --> 02:24.394
I don't know.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.313
[screaming]

02:27.438 --> 02:30.024
The prince was the one who banished him
to the Ulippa System.

02:30.150 --> 02:33.945
He must be trying to stain
Prince Lotor's reputation.

02:34.070 --> 02:38.491
Perhaps. Continue the interrogation.

02:54.257 --> 02:56.426
[grunting]

02:56.551 --> 02:58.636
Excuse me! Coming through!

02:58.761 --> 02:59.804
[yells]

03:00.471 --> 03:01.431
[groans]

03:04.517 --> 03:06.853
Just right in there.
They'll get you sorted out.

03:06.978 --> 03:09.355
-Is that the last of them, Coran?
-That's it.

03:09.480 --> 03:11.816
A few hundred more souls
looking for a new home.

03:11.941 --> 03:15.069
A few hundred more soldiers
in the fight against the Galra.

03:15.194 --> 03:17.030
[lion roaring]

03:17.155 --> 03:18.406
Hey, Pidge is back.

03:25.246 --> 03:26.664
[chuckles]

03:28.958 --> 03:32.128
[mice squeaking excitedly]

03:35.089 --> 03:36.466
[mice squeaking]

03:38.468 --> 03:42.639
[chuckles] Hey, everybody.
This is my brother, Matt.

03:42.764 --> 03:46.809
-Hey, everybody.
-Matt, this is Hunk, Lance, and Coran.

03:46.935 --> 03:48.102
Hey.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.480
-Nice to meet you.
-Pleasure.

03:50.605 --> 03:53.399
And this is Princess Allura of Altea.

03:53.524 --> 03:54.817
Whoa!

03:56.152 --> 03:58.738
It is so wonderful
to finally meet you, Matt.

03:58.863 --> 04:01.241
-[heart beating]
-[gasps]

04:01.366 --> 04:03.743
Whoa! Oh, my goodness!

04:03.868 --> 04:05.286
[laughing]

04:05.411 --> 04:07.997
You are so beautiful!

04:08.957 --> 04:11.542
It is my honor to meet you, Princess.

04:11.668 --> 04:15.630
[growling]

04:15.755 --> 04:18.173
[groaning]

04:23.513 --> 04:25.640
Shiro?

04:25.765 --> 04:29.394
It's so good to see you, um, sir.

04:30.770 --> 04:31.688
Oh.

04:34.607 --> 04:36.276
Pidge never gave up on finding you.

04:36.985 --> 04:39.862
Yeah, she can be pretty stubborn at times.

04:40.655 --> 04:44.409
And I want you to know that all of us
will help you find your father.

04:44.534 --> 04:49.622
-Thanks.
-Matt, this is the Castle of Lions.

04:52.625 --> 04:55.712
-Whoa. Nice ship.
-Let me take you on a tour.

04:57.088 --> 04:58.840
[huffing]

04:59.424 --> 05:00.508
[growls]

05:30.246 --> 05:33.750
I am pleased to see you back
on your throne again, sire.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.836
I'm afraid that Lotor
has not taken his duties

05:36.961 --> 05:40.048
as heir to your empire
seriously, My Lord.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.675
Vast stretches of territory
have fallen to Voltron

05:42.800 --> 05:44.927
and a growing group of insurgents.

05:45.762 --> 05:49.599
Your decision to place him
on the throne was ill-advised.

05:51.809 --> 05:55.521
But no matter. I am returned.

05:55.646 --> 06:00.860
It is time to relieve
my wayward son of his duties.

06:04.113 --> 06:06.616
[Pidge]
This is where all the magic happens.

06:06.741 --> 06:08.117
[Matt]
Whoa!

06:08.659 --> 06:10.119
Impressive!

06:10.244 --> 06:12.497
-This is where I sit.
-Awesome!

06:12.622 --> 06:15.291
And this opens up, and there's a zip line
that takes me to a speeder,

06:15.416 --> 06:16.584
and that loads into my lion.

06:16.709 --> 06:18.377
And this is where Allura stands.

06:18.503 --> 06:20.129
And these little, glowy pillars rise up,

06:20.254 --> 06:22.673
and then she uses Altean magic
that links her to that crystal,

06:22.799 --> 06:24.217
and the crystal powers the ship,

06:24.342 --> 06:27.637
and then she uses this thing
called a teludav to create wormholes!

06:27.762 --> 06:29.806
-[screams]
-This is our training room.

06:29.931 --> 06:32.266
It has invisible walls,
and you can fight robots!

06:32.391 --> 06:34.060
-[mooing]
-This is our cow.

06:34.894 --> 06:36.437
How did you get--? Whoa!

06:36.562 --> 06:39.315
This is our kitchen.
Here's where the food goo comes out.

06:39.440 --> 06:40.691
[grunting]

06:41.859 --> 06:43.611
[moaning]

06:44.362 --> 06:47.448
Hey, this is pretty goo...d. Mm!

06:54.831 --> 06:56.916
[grunting, laughing]

07:01.546 --> 07:04.841
And this is the lounge,
you know, where we just hang.

07:04.966 --> 07:07.718
-Just Voltron Paladins hanging out.
-Hey, hey!

07:07.844 --> 07:10.555
I made celebratory milkshakes for you two!

07:10.680 --> 07:14.392
Just a little welcome gift to Matt
from me and Kaltenecker. No big deal.

07:15.351 --> 07:17.812
Fun fact about Alteans,
they don't get brain freeze.

07:17.937 --> 07:21.357
Coran and Allura just totally hoovered up
their shakes in one slurp. [chuckles]

07:21.482 --> 07:23.818
Uh, I've, uh, never seen
anything like it before.

07:24.652 --> 07:27.905
So, like, what have you been doing
since you got busted out of Galra prison?

07:29.031 --> 07:31.075
I've been stationed
at a listening outpost,

07:31.200 --> 07:33.035
monitoring Galra radio chatter.

07:33.161 --> 07:34.704
Are you serious?

07:34.829 --> 07:37.457
Then you should totally check out
the Galra finder Pidge built.

07:37.582 --> 07:40.376
We used it to track down
a Galra fleet and save a planet.

07:40.501 --> 07:43.045
Hunk made the locator that led us
to the first Voltron Lion,

07:43.171 --> 07:45.756
and we just built
an upgraded version of it to track Lotor.

07:45.882 --> 07:50.219
Wow, Pidge. Dad would be so proud
if he could see what you've done here.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.834
My Lord, we just received a message
from central command.

08:21.959 --> 08:24.837
Emperor Zarkon requires
your presence immediately.

08:24.962 --> 08:29.091
-Very well. Prepare a ship.
-Do you think he's onto us?

08:29.217 --> 08:33.095
No, my father is simply ready
to return to the throne.

08:33.221 --> 08:36.097
He can have it.
Our plans have not changed.

08:36.224 --> 08:38.601
Narti, come with me.

08:41.479 --> 08:44.774
The rest of you,
continue to oversee construction.

08:44.899 --> 08:46.859
I will return shortly.

08:46.984 --> 08:49.946
-Hello.
-Hope we're not interrupting.

08:50.071 --> 08:52.031
I don't believe
we've been properly introduced.

08:52.156 --> 08:56.285
-I am Princess Allura, and this is Coran.
-Pleasure.

08:56.410 --> 08:59.205
-Quite lovely in here.
-Rather.

08:59.330 --> 09:00.414
Is this, uh...?

09:02.291 --> 09:05.753
Well, how do you find living on the Castle
with us? Pleasant, I hope.

09:05.878 --> 09:08.047
[mooing]

09:09.715 --> 09:13.594
Uh, if there's anything I can do to make
your stay here more to your liking,

09:13.719 --> 09:16.097
please do not hesitate to ask.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.099
[Coran]
It's her ship, so... [chuckles]

09:18.224 --> 09:22.812
Uh, we were actually just enjoying
these milkshakes that you made for us.

09:23.437 --> 09:25.856
Positively divine, really.

09:26.649 --> 09:28.693
And, to be honest,
we were wondering... [chuckles]

09:28.818 --> 09:33.406
I don't want to impose at all, of course,
but if it wouldn't be too much bother...

09:34.240 --> 09:35.866
[Allura]
Could we have some more, please?

09:38.869 --> 09:42.081
-Can he understand us?
-I think he's been insulted.

09:42.206 --> 09:44.834
[mooing loudly]

09:45.459 --> 09:47.670
We best just back away.

09:50.881 --> 09:54.844
Well, we'll be off now!
Enjoy your, uh... area!

10:03.978 --> 10:05.855
[cat purring]

10:05.980 --> 10:08.566
Welcome, Prince Lotor.

10:08.691 --> 10:11.277
Please, follow me.

10:19.118 --> 10:22.913
Father, it gives me such pleasure
that you've made a full recovery.

10:23.039 --> 10:25.499
-You look stronger than I've ever--
-Silence.

10:25.625 --> 10:29.920
I did not bring you here
to waste time with your flattery.

10:32.214 --> 10:37.178
You are relieved of your position,
effective immediately.

10:37.970 --> 10:43.142
Lord, I beg you, do not discard me.
Let me stay by your side.

10:43.267 --> 10:46.687
Your short reign
will be regarded as a black spot

10:46.812 --> 10:50.232
on the Galra Empire
for years to come.

10:50.858 --> 10:53.653
Of course, my efforts
at ruling the universe seem feeble

10:53.778 --> 10:55.988
beside your inestimable accomplishments.

10:56.113 --> 10:59.325
But, perhaps, if you were to train me,
I could learn.

10:59.450 --> 11:02.787
You are no longer needed.

11:05.247 --> 11:06.707
As you wish.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.806
Something is amiss with Lotor.

11:21.931 --> 11:28.145
I sensed a powerful energy on him
when he entered, something ancient.

11:28.270 --> 11:31.899
He is no longer my concern.

11:47.873 --> 11:54.046
[whispering voices]

11:57.967 --> 11:59.718
Run the protocol to search for trackers.

11:59.844 --> 12:03.139
[electronic beeping]

12:04.181 --> 12:06.392
Transpose the dynamics
and run that protocol again.

12:15.568 --> 12:19.738
You think you can fool me, witch?
Destroy the bug.

12:25.744 --> 12:28.539
This is a pretty sweet algorithm
for locating Galra targets

12:28.664 --> 12:31.417
within a statistically acceptable
margin of error.

12:31.542 --> 12:36.297
And I love that you color-coded it,
because what are we, animals?

12:36.422 --> 12:39.633
[both laughing]

12:40.426 --> 12:42.511
Ugh, you two are definitely related.

12:44.722 --> 12:49.351
Hunk, using the Fraunhofer lines
to track Voltron, and then the comet...

12:49.477 --> 12:51.395
I mean, that's genius.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.148
Oh, well, yeah, I try.

12:55.858 --> 12:59.195
They say Fraunhofer was
the greatest glassmaker in Europe

12:59.320 --> 13:02.990
and that, when he died, he took all his
greatest recipes to the grave with him.

13:03.115 --> 13:06.202
-I want a Fraunhofer glass.
-So, check this out.

13:06.327 --> 13:07.161
Huh?

13:08.162 --> 13:11.373
This has all the relevant data
from my time with the rebels.

13:11.499 --> 13:14.543
I think if we plug this info
into the setup you guys have here,

13:14.668 --> 13:16.170
it might fill in the gaps.

13:17.129 --> 13:21.217
Then, we just might have the best
anti-Galra intelligence mining operation

13:21.342 --> 13:23.886
in this or any other reality.

13:24.845 --> 13:28.265
This one time, we went to another reality.
It was pretty lame.

13:29.058 --> 13:33.604
Wait, you what?
<span style="style.default_1">You</span> were in a different reality?

13:33.729 --> 13:34.647
No big deal.

13:36.398 --> 13:37.858
My little sister.

13:38.484 --> 13:39.944
[dings]

13:40.069 --> 13:43.072
[beeping]

13:43.197 --> 13:44.156
[dings]

13:44.281 --> 13:45.783
[beeping]

13:45.908 --> 13:47.076
[rapid beeping]

13:48.619 --> 13:49.745
[video game music playing]

13:51.872 --> 13:52.831
[beeping]

13:53.374 --> 13:55.918
[video game music playing]

13:56.043 --> 13:57.711
-[Lance grunting]
-[game dinging]

13:57.836 --> 13:59.505
Come on. [grunting]

13:59.630 --> 14:01.131
Yeah. Oh, no!

14:01.257 --> 14:05.177
[grunting]

14:05.302 --> 14:07.513
Lance, could you assist us for a moment?

14:07.638 --> 14:09.306
-Not now!
-Okay.

14:09.431 --> 14:12.851
[video game music playing]

14:16.021 --> 14:17.898
[whimpers, groans]

14:18.023 --> 14:22.236
We were wondering if you could possibly
assist us in getting a milkshake.

14:22.361 --> 14:24.613
We tried to negotiate some on our own,

14:24.738 --> 14:27.199
but we've run into a bit of difficulty
with Kaltenecker.

14:27.324 --> 14:29.368
[groans]

14:29.493 --> 14:31.704
All right. Let's go.

14:34.331 --> 14:36.750
Well, first off, Kaltenecker is a girl.

14:37.459 --> 14:41.005
-Oh! I see.
-Apologies, madam.

14:41.130 --> 14:44.174
Right, and she's a cow,
so she can't understand you.

14:44.967 --> 14:47.344
Okay, communication issues.

14:47.469 --> 14:50.598
Also, she doesn't make milkshakes.
She has to be milked.

14:50.723 --> 14:51.891
Let me show you.

14:57.438 --> 14:59.398
Watch and learn.
[grunts]

15:06.822 --> 15:10.910
-[both gasping]
-[thunder rumbling]

15:14.079 --> 15:16.332
[mooing]

15:20.294 --> 15:23.255
It's so thick.
It's almost like a milkshake right now!

15:24.048 --> 15:27.343
[both whimpering]

15:36.143 --> 15:37.937
It's not your fault, Kaltenecker.

15:38.062 --> 15:39.688
-You're a beautiful girl...
-[mooing]

15:39.813 --> 15:41.440
...and this is very natural.

15:48.405 --> 15:50.741
How'd it go? Are you fired?

15:51.450 --> 15:54.828
I'm afraid I was relieved
of my command, yes.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.289
The second ship is complete
and ready for testing.

15:57.414 --> 15:59.833
The sentries are just making
some final adjustments.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.460
Excellent.

16:03.337 --> 16:05.422
[whispering voices]

16:07.257 --> 16:09.885
<span style="style.default_1">Sixty percent of the comet's material</span>
<span style="style.default_1">has been used in the production</span>

16:10.010 --> 16:11.804
<span style="style.default_1">of the first two ships, My Lord.</span>

16:11.929 --> 16:14.640
<span style="style.default_1">We will have more than enough</span>
<span style="style.default_1">for the creation of the third.</span>

16:14.765 --> 16:16.141
<span style="style.default_1">Well done, Acxa.</span>

16:16.266 --> 16:17.393
No.

16:21.021 --> 16:24.942
My Lord, somehow Lotor has gotten
his hands on a trans-reality comet.

16:25.067 --> 16:25.901
What?

16:26.026 --> 16:29.655
And worse, it appears
he is building ships from the ore.

16:30.280 --> 16:34.785
The only reason to keep them secret
is to use them against the empire.

16:34.910 --> 16:36.870
But we will strike first.

16:38.205 --> 16:40.124
Mobilize the fleet!

16:40.249 --> 16:43.252
Hunt down Prince Lotor.

16:47.464 --> 16:50.050
I think we've just about got it.

16:51.677 --> 16:52.761
-All right!
-Yes!

16:52.886 --> 16:54.054
Wow!

16:54.179 --> 16:58.684
This is unbelievable. We're tracking
Galra fleet movements almost live.

16:58.809 --> 17:01.854
I think I know a few tweaks we can make
to extend our range.

17:01.979 --> 17:04.314
-Hold on, Pidge.
-What's up?

17:04.940 --> 17:08.318
It's a scrambled message.
I've collected hundreds of 'em.

17:08.444 --> 17:10.695
-I never crack 'em.
-Let me see.

17:15.867 --> 17:19.038
I'm guessing this isn't just a simple
number-for-letter swap.

17:19.163 --> 17:22.790
I've run these through every kind
of decryption technology I can think of,

17:22.915 --> 17:26.587
and I've spent days with just the numbers
and a Galra language log.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.797
-Nothing.
-Maybe they're not words.

17:28.922 --> 17:29.923
Maybe they're just numbers.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.805
Maybe they're a frequency.

17:36.930 --> 17:40.392
A quantum signal that broadcasts
other frequencies to go to?

17:40.517 --> 17:44.646
It's too high.
These are more than 3,000 gigahertz.

17:44.772 --> 17:46.273
-Invert it.
-What?

17:46.398 --> 17:50.569
For every wave we receive,
there's only partial transmittance, right?

17:50.694 --> 17:52.780
Oh, right, yeah.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.823
So, we figure
the transmission coefficient...

17:54.948 --> 17:58.077
And tune for the frequency
of the reflected waves.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.875

-Zarkon is alive?

18:21.016 --> 18:23.185
Guys, look at this.

18:23.310 --> 18:27.606
I've never seen troop mobilization
on this level before.

18:27.731 --> 18:30.442
-What are they attacking?
-That's just it.

18:30.567 --> 18:32.569
As far as I can tell, nothing.

18:33.403 --> 18:38.700
There are no planets, no rebel ships,
no Blade of Marmora bases, nothing.

18:38.826 --> 18:40.661
<span style="style.default_1">Engage targets at coordinates...</span>

18:40.786 --> 18:43.163
Whoever they're attacking,
we have to help.

18:43.288 --> 18:45.582
I don't like it.
We should be gathering intelligence,

18:45.707 --> 18:47.835
not diving into a fight
without knowing why,

18:47.960 --> 18:50.879
especially now
that we know Zarkon is alive.

18:51.004 --> 18:55.175
-[Pidge] We could go check it out.
-I think they'd probably notice us.

18:55.300 --> 18:59.513
-Not if we're cloaked.
-You have cloaking? Who are you?

18:59.638 --> 19:02.015
I'm not sure it's safe
for just the Green Lion.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.434
I'm pretty sure
I can upgrade Voltron with cloaking.

19:04.560 --> 19:06.228
We could all go.
[grunts]

19:06.353 --> 19:09.439
Were you just waiting for your big brother
to show up before you rolled that one out?

19:10.107 --> 19:11.859
It's something
I've been working on for a while,

19:11.984 --> 19:15.737
but I can't pilot the Green Lion
and operate the cloaking at the same time.

19:15.863 --> 19:19.408
-But if I had a co-pilot...
-Absolutely.

19:19.533 --> 19:20.993
Let's get to the lions.

19:26.206 --> 19:27.124

19:32.171 --> 19:34.715
<span style="style.default_1">-What's happening?</span>
-A Galra fleet is attacking us.

19:34.840 --> 19:37.509
<span style="style.default_1">-Return fire!</span>
-Wait, there's another fleet.

19:37.634 --> 19:40.846
And another one.
We can't hold them all off.

19:43.056 --> 19:46.143
Prepare the Sincline ships to takeoff.
Load the comet into mine.

19:46.268 --> 19:47.561
[rumbling]

19:47.686 --> 19:49.188
-We're leaving.
-[metal groaning]

19:53.734 --> 19:56.737
We're getting close. Everyone, get ready.

19:56.862 --> 19:59.823
-Go ahead. Run the cloaking subroutine.
-Got it.

20:01.950 --> 20:05.287
Initializing cloak.
I'm not sure how long we can keep this up.

20:07.122 --> 20:10.083
All right, let's take a look
at who the Galra are attacking.

20:26.433 --> 20:30.103
What the cheese?
It's Galra-on-Galra violence, again.

20:30.229 --> 20:33.106
Oh, these people
just do not like each other.

20:39.529 --> 20:41.365
Divert all power to defenses.

20:41.490 --> 20:43.158
Hold the attack off until we're away.

20:43.283 --> 20:44.326
-Then, scuttle the--

20:44.451 --> 20:46.954
-[electricity crackling]
-[metal groaning]

20:47.079 --> 20:49.748
-How did they find us?
-We must have been tracked.

20:58.382 --> 20:59.216
[grunts]

21:14.064 --> 21:15.774
[Pidge]
<span style="style.default_1">Whose ships are those?</span>

21:17.359 --> 21:18.485
It's Lotor.

21:19.319 --> 21:22.155
[Shiro] <span style="style.default_1">Lotor and Zarkon must be fighting</span>
<span style="style.default_1">for control of the empire.</span>

21:22.281 --> 21:24.324
[Hunk] <span style="style.default_1">Guys, those ships</span>
<span style="style.default_1">are getting awfully close.</span>

21:26.243 --> 21:30.330
Uh-oh. The trails from Lotor's ship drives
messed with our cloaking spectrum.

21:30.455 --> 21:31.915
Can you find a work-around?

21:32.040 --> 21:33.458
[Shiro]
<span style="style.default_1">It's too late. Our cover's been blown.</span>

21:33.583 --> 21:34.668
<span style="style.default_1">We may have to engage.</span>

21:39.631 --> 21:42.259
-[grunts] Hunk, use your bayard.
-You got it.

21:51.727 --> 21:54.438
[Shiro] <span style="style.default_1">All right, that'll hold them.</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Let's get out of here.</span>

22:04.906 --> 22:07.576
[rhythmic beeping]

22:07.701 --> 22:10.287
Sir, we're picking up a transmission.

22:13.206 --> 22:17.002
Attention, citizens of the Galra Empire.

22:18.086 --> 22:21.715
From this day forward, my son Lotor

22:21.840 --> 22:25.844
<span style="style.default_1">is to be regarded</span>
<span style="style.default_1">as a fugitive criminal of the empire.</span>

<span style="style.default_1">All citizens are authorized</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to use deadly force to stop him</span>

22:35.270 --> 22:40.275
<span style="style.default_1">I repeat, Prince Lotor</span>
<span style="style.default_1">is an enemy of the state.</span>
