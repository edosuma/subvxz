WEBVTT

00:16.733 --> 00:18.193
Hey.

00:18.276 --> 00:22.615
I don't know about you guys, but me,

00:22.698 --> 00:24.200
I've had it up to here.

00:27.204 --> 00:31.250
There are some 40-odd homicides a day
on our streets.

00:31.333 --> 00:34.712
There are over two million
illegal guns in this city.

00:34.796 --> 00:37.841
Man, that's enough guns to invade
a whole damn country with.

00:39.051 --> 00:42.221
They shoot a cop in our city
without even thinking twice about it.

00:43.556 --> 00:45.475
Now, come on.

00:45.559 --> 00:47.978
I mean, you guys
ride the subway.

00:48.061 --> 00:50.064
How much more of this grief
we gonna stand for?

00:50.147 --> 00:53.359
How many more locks we got
to put on our goddamn doors?

00:53.443 --> 00:56.405
Now, we ain't got the police,

00:56.488 --> 00:58.490
the prosecutors,

00:58.574 --> 01:02.328
the courts or the prisons.

01:02.412 --> 01:04.497
I mean, it's over.

01:04.581 --> 01:06.500
The books don't balance.

01:06.583 --> 01:09.211
We are a statistic.

01:11.422 --> 01:12.757
Now, I'm tellin' you,

01:12.841 --> 01:16.345
you can't go to the corner
and buy a pack of cigarettes after dark,

01:16.428 --> 01:19.807
because you know the punks and the scum
own the street when the sun goes down,

01:19.891 --> 01:21.911
and our own government
can't protect its own people.

01:21.935 --> 01:24.438
Then I say this, pal,

01:24.521 --> 01:27.066
you got a moral obligation,

01:27.149 --> 01:30.194
the right of self-preservation.

01:30.278 --> 01:35.701
Now, you can run, you can hide, or you
can start to live like human beings again.

01:35.784 --> 01:38.037
This is our Waterloo, baby!

01:38.120 --> 01:43.001
If you want your city back,
you gotta take it.

01:43.084 --> 01:44.670
Dig it? Take it!

04:39.166 --> 04:41.461
How we doin'?

05:25.221 --> 05:27.348
Make another sound, and I'll cut ya.

05:34.523 --> 05:38.403
No! No! Help!

05:38.486 --> 05:41.990
Please! Stop it! No!

05:42.074 --> 05:43.993
No!

05:49.124 --> 05:52.252
No!
Shh! Be quiet.

05:52.336 --> 05:55.214
No! No!

05:58.093 --> 06:00.888
No! Get off-

06:01.013 --> 06:02.973
No!
Shh.

06:03.057 --> 06:06.561
No! Help! Help! Stop! No!

06:06.644 --> 06:08.563
Help! Stop!

06:08.647 --> 06:10.858
Be quiet.

06:10.941 --> 06:13.194
Shh.

06:15.780 --> 06:18.742
I won't forget your face.

06:18.825 --> 06:21.954
Stop it!

07:31.703 --> 07:35.916
How come we never get a case
on the ground floor? Hiya, pal.

07:35.999 --> 07:38.794
Ken, what do you have
for your favorite detective?

07:38.878 --> 07:40.797
Oh, miss, you mind staying
a little longer?

07:40.922 --> 07:43.925
So far, nobody's heard anything.
Nobody's seen anything.

07:44.009 --> 07:49.098
The usual. If you come up with
anything, I'll be working upstairs.

07:49.182 --> 07:51.226
Alex, we're workin' on the roof.

07:57.608 --> 07:59.318
Let me explain somethin' to you.

07:59.402 --> 08:01.363
They started trial proceedings
without me, right?

08:01.446 --> 08:03.490
They never notified me.
Chips?

08:03.615 --> 08:06.994
Yeah.
They knew where I was, right?

08:07.078 --> 08:10.832
They got no proof that they
never notified me of the papers.

08:10.915 --> 08:13.919
So my lawyer's gonna throw
mistrial at 'em, right?

08:14.002 --> 08:17.006
- The little guy with the cap?
- That's him.

08:17.089 --> 08:20.301
I got this case beat,
I'm tellin' ya.

08:20.385 --> 08:24.473
The next time I go to trial, I'll be
old enough to collect social security.

08:24.556 --> 08:27.685
You understand me? I'll be old
enough to collect social security.

08:27.769 --> 08:29.896
And I got this thing beat,
I'm tellin' ya.

08:29.980 --> 08:32.774
A shame all this crime.
Thank you, Mrs. Vogel.

08:34.693 --> 08:37.989
- You ain't got no more stories, Rubin?
- Come on, you guys.

08:38.072 --> 08:41.534
What are you breaking my balls for?
Hey, who are these three guys?

08:41.618 --> 08:45.790
Slime!
Rubin, man!

08:48.460 --> 08:50.253
Leave me alone!

08:50.378 --> 08:54.467
Leave me alone!
Come on!

08:56.302 --> 08:58.096
Leave me alone!

09:17.160 --> 09:19.579
There it is.
Yep, there it is.

09:19.663 --> 09:22.666
Just keep watching.
Here we go.

09:22.750 --> 09:24.877
Okay, now. Oh, no.

09:24.961 --> 09:27.005
They must be scared.

09:28.507 --> 09:32.094
Wow. That thing's going around. Yeah.

09:32.178 --> 09:35.265
Pretty good. Nice and easy.
We're gonna bring it around.

09:35.348 --> 09:38.936
- Pretty good.
- It's going out far.

09:39.019 --> 09:42.940
Now, watch how I control it.
And bring it down like that.

09:43.024 --> 09:44.984
Bring it up like that.

09:45.068 --> 09:48.196
Wow!
Coming again. Coming again.

09:48.280 --> 09:50.616
Bring it around.
Not too close to the trees.

09:50.699 --> 09:54.454
There we go.
Here we come in for a landing.

09:54.537 --> 09:56.456
And it's down.
Okay, go get it.

09:56.540 --> 09:58.876
Okay, Daddy, I'll go get it.

10:03.172 --> 10:06.176
Ooh, I'm freezing.

10:13.476 --> 10:16.021
Be real careful out there, Scott.

10:17.397 --> 10:19.316
Oh, Eddie, it’s just-

10:19.400 --> 10:24.531
It's so important that we spend
more time together, all of us.

10:24.656 --> 10:27.117
Whee!
Listen.

10:27.201 --> 10:29.328
Business is taking up
a lot of my time right now.

10:29.412 --> 10:32.499
But I had a good idea the other day.

10:32.582 --> 10:34.668
As soon we got
a little bit more dough coming in,

10:34.751 --> 10:39.841
what we'll do is we'll pack up the van and we'll
take a little bit of a trip to Florida maybe.

10:39.924 --> 10:41.843
Good idea?

10:41.926 --> 10:43.929
Oh, that'll be wonderful.

10:45.973 --> 10:48.142
Here you go, big man.
I'm hungry, Daddy.

10:48.225 --> 10:49.685
Nice.
Hi, baby.

10:49.769 --> 10:52.939
Are you cold?
I'm freezing.

11:42.080 --> 11:44.166
You guys ought to put
in air conditioning.

11:44.291 --> 11:46.252
Hey, Eddie, how you doing?
All right.

11:46.335 --> 11:48.355
You just in time for the football pool.
You want in?

11:48.379 --> 11:50.924
Who have I got?
Blind pick.

11:51.049 --> 11:54.094
Only cost a buck.
Blind pick, huh?

11:54.178 --> 11:56.305
Here's my lunch money.
Who's gonna pay me off?

11:56.431 --> 11:59.494
Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it.
How about you, Ramon? You wanna get in on it?

11:59.518 --> 12:01.895
Hell, no, man.
Every time I bet with you, I lose.

12:02.020 --> 12:04.231
Where's the machine?
Right there.

12:04.315 --> 12:06.567
Burke, you want in?
Yeah.

12:08.069 --> 12:10.739
Ramon. Eddie.

12:10.864 --> 12:12.992
Not bad. How you doin'?
You look terrific, man.

12:13.117 --> 12:15.912
Younger as the years go by.
Yeah, I'm losing my hair.

12:15.995 --> 12:18.039
Come on.
Burke.

12:19.541 --> 12:21.669
This is the motor I pulled out.
Yeah.

12:21.752 --> 12:24.756
And that's the motor I put in,
and it still don't work.

12:24.839 --> 12:27.592
Okay, let me at it.
It's all yours.

12:51.912 --> 12:53.957
Fill it fast, pendejo.

12:57.085 --> 13:00.714
How long do you think it's gonna
be? Oh, about another 15 minutes.

13:15.273 --> 13:17.609
It's $10.

13:17.734 --> 13:21.531
How much, man?
What are you, deaf? Ten dollars.

13:23.366 --> 13:27.079
We ain't got it.
You punks make me sick.

13:27.162 --> 13:30.333
You look like some kind of animals.
We don't want you in this neighborhood.

13:30.416 --> 13:33.837
Now, you get out of my station.
Get out of my-

13:35.630 --> 13:37.716
- Mommy!
- Stop him!

13:37.800 --> 13:41.054
- Hey, lady.
- Get out of my station.

13:41.179 --> 13:44.349
What the hell are you doing?
Hey, stop it!

13:46.727 --> 13:49.230
Get off of me!
You stop that!

13:49.313 --> 13:51.816
Stop it!
You leave Mr. Nulty alone!

13:51.900 --> 13:54.236
Get out of-

13:54.361 --> 13:56.488
I'm gonna call the police
on you. Call the police.

13:56.572 --> 13:59.033
Fuck you.
Bastard!

14:02.871 --> 14:04.957
Yo! Rico!

14:05.040 --> 14:07.168
! Vamos!

14:35.284 --> 14:39.124
Hey, guys. I got a good story for you. I just heard
it this morning. You guys wanna hear a story?

14:39.205 --> 14:44.003
No stories today, Jake, huh?
Just a nice, cold beer.

14:44.128 --> 14:46.464
You bring me some cash
today? Payday's tomorrow.

14:46.547 --> 14:48.591
Put it on the tab.

14:48.675 --> 14:50.760
The beer's warm.
Pour it yourself, huh?

14:50.844 --> 14:53.347
You got coffee?
You get that from Tracy.

14:53.430 --> 14:56.517
Hey, look who's on the tube.

14:56.601 --> 14:59.145
Listen, there are certain politicians
in this city...

14:59.229 --> 15:02.441
who don't wanna see
a successful Italian businessman.

15:02.524 --> 15:05.152
I own a leasing company.
I rent equipment.

15:05.236 --> 15:07.822
It’s just racist propaganda.

15:07.906 --> 15:09.825
Just because I dress well
and I live well,

15:09.908 --> 15:12.369
does that mean that I'm involved
with sex or narcotics?

15:13.412 --> 15:15.498
Looks like the feds
caught up to Stokes.

15:15.581 --> 15:18.209
As far as the indictment,
my lawyers are gonna handle it. I-

15:18.293 --> 15:20.587
Nah.

15:20.671 --> 15:22.965
Dudes like Stokes don't get caught, man.

15:23.048 --> 15:25.009
Everybody knows
that with his connections,

15:25.093 --> 15:28.430
the most he'll ever do is weekends
at the federal country club.

15:51.332 --> 15:53.334
Come on out.

16:15.777 --> 16:21.242
Scott, I want you to go upstairs and I
want you to put yourself to bed, okay?

16:21.325 --> 16:23.578
I don't wanna put myself to bed.

16:23.661 --> 16:26.832
Scott, just do it. Okay?

16:26.915 --> 16:29.543
Please?

16:30.586 --> 16:33.214
Mommy will be right up.

16:33.298 --> 16:35.300
Take your jacket.

16:49.317 --> 16:52.779
Berry Craftsman, Incorporated.
Eddie Marino, please.

16:52.904 --> 16:54.906
I'm sorry.
He's not in right now, ma'am.

16:55.032 --> 16:57.409
How long ago did he leave?
Fifteen minutes ago.

16:57.493 --> 16:59.537
Never mind. I'll call back.

17:23.231 --> 17:25.108
Hey, Jake.
Gibby, how are you?

17:25.233 --> 17:27.111
Okay. How are you?
Good to see you.

17:27.236 --> 17:29.781
My lunch ready? Yeah. A couple
of minutes. Relax a while.

17:29.906 --> 17:31.992
Okay. Thank you.
Overtime for me. I don't care.

17:32.075 --> 17:34.429
I'll work till 8:00 tonight.
I'll see you guys in the morning.

17:34.453 --> 17:37.039
You pick up the check.
Right, right.

17:39.083 --> 17:41.086
We got more coffee?
Where's that girl?

17:46.050 --> 17:48.386
The law is here.

17:49.637 --> 17:53.100
Last night we found a kid on a lot
over on Jackson Avenue.

17:54.268 --> 17:57.438
His friend said somebody
pulled him off the street.

17:57.522 --> 18:00.066
Broke every bone in his body.

18:00.150 --> 18:02.611
Then left him in the lot
like a sack of dirty laundry.

18:05.281 --> 18:09.244
Now, I know we only got two cars
out on nights when we need 10.

18:10.287 --> 18:15.376
But I'm in that seat eight to 10
hours a day, in the heat, in the rain.

18:15.459 --> 18:18.338
I don't wanna hear
about no goon squads or lynch mobs.

18:19.464 --> 18:21.425
You guys start something like that,

18:21.508 --> 18:24.136
and sometimes
it don't quit on its own.

18:26.723 --> 18:29.393
After work, stay home
like other people.

18:29.476 --> 18:32.146
Which people, Officer Gibbons?

18:32.229 --> 18:35.483
The ones who are afraid to come
out of their houses after dark?

18:42.742 --> 18:45.453
Enjoy it, Gibby.
Thanks, Jake.

18:46.538 --> 18:48.457
Is Eddie Marino back yet?

18:48.540 --> 18:50.459
No, he isn't, ma'am.

18:50.542 --> 18:52.878
Would you have him call his wife
as soon as he gets back?

18:52.962 --> 18:54.380
Sure.
Thank you.

19:08.355 --> 19:10.107
Police operator 729.

19:10.190 --> 19:14.404
Yes. This is Mrs. Marino
at 87721 22th Street.

19:14.487 --> 19:17.908
I just had an incident with a man
at a gas station and he threatened me.

19:17.991 --> 19:19.952
Now I’ve just seen him
in the front of my house.

19:20.035 --> 19:22.538
Could you please send
a patrol car right away?

19:22.622 --> 19:24.600
We can't do anything
about a verbal assault, ma'am.

19:24.624 --> 19:27.920
But I am alone here with my baby.

19:28.003 --> 19:29.463
Please.

19:29.547 --> 19:32.050
Calm down, lady.
Calm down. Relax.

19:32.175 --> 19:35.679
We'll send over the next
available patrol car.

20:06.048 --> 20:08.050
This is gonna be easy.

20:09.302 --> 20:11.679
Hey, you're really too smart.

20:11.763 --> 20:14.182
- The name's Rico.
- Ooh.

20:14.266 --> 20:18.646
Lady, you don't know who the fuck
you messin' with, man. Are you crazy?

20:18.771 --> 20:22.150
You're crazy, lady.
You got some nice family, lady.

20:22.233 --> 20:25.088
Are you gonna come over and slap me in
the face and kickin' my people around?

20:25.112 --> 20:28.157
Yo, mami,
where you hide your bread?

20:30.201 --> 20:33.997
- Yo, mami, where you hidin' your money?
- In the kitchen.

20:34.081 --> 20:35.833
- The kitchen.
- Yo.

20:40.296 --> 20:43.300
- Scott!
- Mommy!

20:43.383 --> 20:45.219
Hide!

20:45.302 --> 20:47.096
No!

20:50.517 --> 20:53.145
You leave him alone!

20:53.228 --> 20:54.813
Leave him alone!

21:16.631 --> 21:18.174
Let go! Let me go!

21:30.564 --> 21:33.693
Let go! Let me-

21:42.495 --> 21:43.663
Mommy.

21:46.875 --> 21:48.877
Let me go!

21:48.960 --> 21:51.046
Scott! No!

22:08.692 --> 22:10.903
Somebody!

22:10.986 --> 22:13.656
Somebody help me!

22:13.740 --> 22:16.743
Help me! Somebody help!

22:16.827 --> 22:20.915
Help me! Help me!

22:27.339 --> 22:29.300
Someone!

22:29.383 --> 22:31.802
Help me! Someone!

22:38.644 --> 22:41.689
My baby!

22:41.773 --> 22:43.775
No!

23:04.382 --> 23:07.219
Burke, I gotta pick up a part
tomorrow morning.

23:07.303 --> 23:09.573
I'll be out of your way by 10:00.
You'll get your machine back.

23:09.597 --> 23:12.016
Thanks for the tools.
Great.

23:19.400 --> 23:21.361
Let me ask you a question.

23:21.444 --> 23:24.990
That thing with the cop this afternoon
- what was that all about?

23:25.115 --> 23:28.953
You ever a victim, Eddie?
What do you mean?

23:31.289 --> 23:33.834
I used to be a cop.

23:35.377 --> 23:37.505
That's all I ever wanted to be,

23:37.588 --> 23:40.508
ever since I was a little kid, you know.

23:40.592 --> 23:44.805
The day I got my shield,
I felt like I was John Wayne.

23:44.888 --> 23:49.018
I was gonna fight crime.
I was gonna be a hero, you know?

23:51.021 --> 23:53.232
My partner,
he thought I was crazy.

23:53.315 --> 23:56.110
He had a year and a half to go
till his pension,

23:56.193 --> 24:01.575
and he wouldn't bust a shoplifter
because he felt it was a waste of time.

24:01.658 --> 24:06.122
He got his pension
and I got laid off.

24:06.205 --> 24:09.542
Look, I know where Gibbons the cop
was coming from.

24:09.626 --> 24:13.505
There are better ways
to handle these situations.

24:14.965 --> 24:16.467
Hmm.

24:18.011 --> 24:21.765
You part of this thing too? God said
he'd help those who help themselves.

24:21.849 --> 24:24.018
That's all we're trying to do.

24:24.101 --> 24:26.729
It’s just about people
trying to help each other.

25:20.751 --> 25:22.378
Oh-

25:22.503 --> 25:25.715
Come on! Stand aside!

25:25.799 --> 25:28.802
Let us through!
Look out. Look out.

25:32.390 --> 25:34.684
Vickie! Hey! You! Come back here!

25:34.768 --> 25:36.645
What happened?
Mr. Marino.

25:36.770 --> 25:39.732
Where's my wife? What happened to
my family? Listen to me, Mr. Marino.

25:39.815 --> 25:42.652
Don't torture yourself
by being here.

25:42.735 --> 25:44.904
We know
who's responsible for this.

25:46.281 --> 25:50.453
If you wanna make this thing come out
even, go see this district attorney.

25:52.997 --> 25:56.251
Good evening.
Astoria General Hospital.

25:56.335 --> 25:59.672
I'm sorry, sir. We're not allowed
to give out that kind of information.

25:59.755 --> 26:01.966
Uh, Mr. Marino?

26:02.050 --> 26:05.470
I'm Dr. Fallon.
How's my wife?

26:05.554 --> 26:09.350
Well, she received severe lacerations
of her lower abdomen.

26:09.433 --> 26:11.436
You want a swig?

26:11.519 --> 26:14.898
Uh, several of her vital organs
were punctured.

26:14.982 --> 26:18.611
Her neck and spinal cord
were badly damaged.

26:18.694 --> 26:20.655
She's-She's lucky to be alive.

26:21.698 --> 26:23.825
I wanna see her.

26:24.826 --> 26:27.580
Look, there's nothing you can do.

26:27.663 --> 26:29.624
Why don't you go home for a while.

26:29.707 --> 26:32.919
We're, uh-We're taking
really good care of her.

26:33.003 --> 26:37.049
Uh, I didn't tell her about the boy.

26:38.509 --> 26:41.972
I'll try to keep that from her
as long as I can.

27:58.812 --> 28:00.981
Come on, Eddie.
I'll give you a ride home.

28:05.194 --> 28:07.155
No, thanks.

28:25.176 --> 28:29.306
Mr. Marino,
District Attorney Fletcher's expecting you.

28:29.390 --> 28:32.769
Her office is the first
door on the right. Thank you.

28:35.021 --> 28:38.984
Come in.

28:40.486 --> 28:42.864
- I'm Eddie Marino.
- Please be seated.

28:47.911 --> 28:49.830
Thank you.

28:49.914 --> 28:54.210
I'm Mary Fletcher, Mr. Marino.
I'm sorry about your loss.

28:56.129 --> 28:58.549
Look, I've never been through
anything like this before,

28:58.632 --> 29:01.928
so you'll just have
to tell me what to do.

29:02.011 --> 29:05.640
Well, the police have
a Frederico Melendez in custody.

29:05.724 --> 29:08.352
He's the leader
of the Headhunter gang.

29:08.435 --> 29:11.356
A gas station owner
has signed a statement...

29:11.439 --> 29:14.025
that he saw Melendez
assault your wife.

29:15.068 --> 29:17.029
I want you to sign that.

29:18.614 --> 29:20.908
It's an assault complaint.

29:20.992 --> 29:23.912
I'm gonna seek indictment
for murder and assault,

29:23.995 --> 29:26.331
because we have a witness
to the assault.

29:26.415 --> 29:28.626
I could have gone after
the whole degenerate gang.

29:28.709 --> 29:32.297
But have you ever seen a dozen
gang members sitting in a courtroom?

29:32.380 --> 29:35.300
They scare the hell
out of a jury.

29:35.384 --> 29:38.596
Are you trying to tell me that this guy's
done something like this before?

29:38.679 --> 29:43.226
Melendez has had 22 arrests.

29:43.310 --> 29:46.647
Of the half a million felonies
in this city,

29:46.730 --> 29:51.569
only 4,000 of the defendants have actually
been tried, convicted and sent to prison.

29:51.653 --> 29:55.658
Eighty-five percent of all
serious crime gets disposed of...

29:55.741 --> 29:59.329
through misdemeanors,
dismissed or not even prosecuted...

29:59.412 --> 30:02.040
because witnesses
are afraid to testify.

30:02.124 --> 30:07.171
A mugger is usually back out on the street
before the victim gets out of the hospital.

30:08.756 --> 30:11.968
I want this guy to pay
for what he did to my family.

30:12.052 --> 30:14.722
Okay.

30:14.805 --> 30:17.099
You sign that.

30:55.186 --> 30:58.356
The city still catches
your eye from here, you know?

30:59.691 --> 31:01.694
It's 'cause you can't see
all the trash from here.

31:01.777 --> 31:04.530
You can't see the 10-year-old kids
pushing dope on the streets...

31:04.614 --> 31:07.993
or giving their asses away
in the parking lots.

31:10.245 --> 31:14.083
When I was a kid,
I could sleep with the windows open.

31:14.167 --> 31:16.169
I wonder what happened to that.

31:17.337 --> 31:19.464
We let it get away
from us, Eddie.

31:19.548 --> 31:23.928
And now that we want it back,
we can't even pay for it.

31:24.971 --> 31:27.682
This thing's turning my guts.

31:27.766 --> 31:31.896
Hey, man, come on, huh?

31:31.979 --> 31:35.900
Let it out. Take care of this situation
by yourself. Make you feel better.

31:37.819 --> 31:41.949
We got a system of laws. We got courts.
What the hell you talking' about?

31:42.033 --> 31:43.952
System?

31:44.035 --> 31:46.121
System, my ass.

31:46.204 --> 31:48.123
What goddamn system?

31:48.207 --> 31:51.294
Who are they protecting,
the scum on the streets or us?

31:54.381 --> 31:57.134
One day some juveniles
come to my old man's house.

31:57.217 --> 32:00.846
They beat him till he couldn't hardly
take a walk or a piss by himself anymore.

32:00.930 --> 32:02.891
You know where those punks are now?

32:02.974 --> 32:05.435
Still on the street.

32:07.521 --> 32:09.523
So I ask myself,

32:09.607 --> 32:13.194
what happens if one day
some punks come to my house?

32:13.278 --> 32:15.572
What's my life worth?

32:18.200 --> 32:20.161
That's why I carry that, Eddie.

32:21.537 --> 32:24.249
You figure that's the answer, huh?

32:24.332 --> 32:28.087
That's my judge and my jury.

32:30.256 --> 32:33.510
And what happens if you do something
to me I don't like?

32:33.593 --> 32:36.639
Or I don't like the way
some guy's got his hair parted?

32:37.681 --> 32:39.681
Pretty soon you got assholes
all over the street...

32:39.725 --> 32:42.562
Looking to blow
each other's brains out.

32:42.646 --> 32:47.151
And if I do that,
what makes me different than the scum?

32:50.697 --> 32:55.786
Hey, that's something you got
to figure out all by yourself, man.

33:38.962 --> 33:41.465
Yeah. What if somebody
needs me to testify?

33:41.590 --> 33:44.552
Yo, Prago.
Yo.

33:47.263 --> 33:50.016
- Diablo.
- How goes it, brother?

33:51.935 --> 33:54.897
The bro's say-

34:02.990 --> 34:04.992
Hi, sugar.

34:13.418 --> 34:15.420
Mr. Marino.

34:16.464 --> 34:19.426
We're the first case
on the calendar.

34:47.292 --> 34:49.460
You're a little light,
ain't ya, kid?

34:49.545 --> 34:52.465
You'll get the rest
when he get off.

34:53.800 --> 34:57.054
Oh, yeah?
Well, listen to me, pal.

34:57.137 --> 35:00.641
You screw around with me,
and your ass will be with legal aid...

35:00.725 --> 35:03.561
and that spic friend of yours
will be raw meat in jail.

35:24.002 --> 35:27.631
Now you can count, bad man.

35:35.599 --> 35:37.977
See you in court, homes.

35:42.357 --> 35:46.362
I hope you have a strong constitution,
because you're gonna need it.

35:46.570 --> 35:49.240
Why?
Judge Sinclair.

35:49.323 --> 35:50.366
All rise.

35:51.367 --> 35:55.122
The man is an irresponsible asshole.
Remove your hats. Find seats, please.

35:55.205 --> 35:58.793
Put away those newspapers. There'll
be no smoking in this courtroom.

35:58.876 --> 36:00.879
Be seated.

36:03.757 --> 36:08.554
The State of New York and Edward
Marino versus Frederico Melendez.

36:12.517 --> 36:16.564
- Both sides ready?
- The People are ready, Your Honor.

36:16.647 --> 36:20.568
Who's representing Melendez?

36:22.112 --> 36:24.657
Anybody here for Melendez?

36:24.740 --> 36:28.244
Excuse me, Your Honor.
Counsel is present for the defense.

36:57.111 --> 37:01.617
- This is an assault charge and a felony murder.
- Yes, Your Honor.

37:01.700 --> 37:04.871
- Are your papers in order?
- Yes, Your Honor.

37:04.954 --> 37:09.084
- How does the defendant plead?
- Not guilty, Your Honor.

37:09.167 --> 37:13.172
Your Honor, we have
a signed affidavit...

37:13.255 --> 37:17.302
from an eyewitness to the felony
who is willing to testify at a trial.

37:18.678 --> 37:20.639
Is this eyewitness present?

37:20.723 --> 37:25.103
Mrs. Marino is presently incapacitated
at Queens General Hospital.

37:25.186 --> 37:28.940
Excuse me, Your Honor. May the
counsel please approach the bench?

37:29.024 --> 37:32.194
- Counsel may approach the bench.
- Thank you.

37:42.081 --> 37:47.963
Your Honor, my client is willing
to plead guilty to the assault...

37:48.046 --> 37:50.424
if the felony charge
against him is dropped.

37:50.508 --> 37:53.928
Your Honor, we are talking
about homicide.

37:54.012 --> 37:55.764
The state wishes
maximum penalty.

37:55.847 --> 37:57.766
I expect the state to wish as much.

38:02.855 --> 38:06.651
The state is willing to drop
the felony charge.

38:07.694 --> 38:10.030
Fine.

38:10.114 --> 38:14.619
In lieu of the defendant's previous record
of no prior convictions-

38:14.703 --> 38:17.331
He has had 22 arrests.

38:17.414 --> 38:19.667
I've tried the defendant myself.

38:19.750 --> 38:22.003
This is an arraignment, Counselor.

38:24.256 --> 38:27.927
This is a felony assault
request, Your Honor.

38:28.010 --> 38:30.304
The state wishes to seek
an indictment...

38:30.388 --> 38:33.433
on the defendant's 22 arrests,

38:33.516 --> 38:37.271
not on his previous
no convictions.

38:42.652 --> 38:46.907
A defendant's past history
has no bearing on present allegations.

38:46.991 --> 38:50.453
Mary, why don't you relax? This
case doesn't have to come to trial.

38:52.622 --> 38:55.501
He has a rap sheet a mile long.

38:55.584 --> 38:59.255
The state and my client
demand the right to prosecute.

39:03.885 --> 39:06.388
There will be no demanding
in my courtroom.

39:06.472 --> 39:11.895
I would advise you to take your snide
behavior and obvious frustrations elsewhere.

39:13.438 --> 39:16.650
Now, does the state
have a proposal?

39:18.653 --> 39:21.615
- Fifteen years.
- Fifth-Are you kidding?

39:21.698 --> 39:23.992
We're plea bargaining here.
Show a little compromise.

39:24.076 --> 39:26.746
- I quite agree. Can you take five?
- No, Your Honor.

39:26.829 --> 39:29.457
This would be
the defendant's first conviction.

39:29.541 --> 39:32.210
Now, we propose
two years suspended sentence,

39:32.294 --> 39:34.880
if possible.
No.

39:35.005 --> 39:37.049
No way.
Two years it is.

39:37.133 --> 39:39.177
- Wait a minute.
- Back to your seats, Counselor.

39:39.260 --> 39:43.474
- This is crazy.
- Miss Fletcher, you're out of order.

39:45.476 --> 39:46.811
Damn it!

39:51.733 --> 39:57.115
- It's in the bag.
- The court will dispose of this case in the following manner.

39:57.198 --> 39:59.409
I'll accept a plea of guilty
to assault...

39:59.492 --> 40:02.037
and drop the felony charge.

40:03.372 --> 40:07.335
- Are you ready for sentencing?
- Yes, we are, Your Honor.

40:11.590 --> 40:15.678
- The court sentences you to two years.
- It isn't enough.

40:15.762 --> 40:18.849
Sentence to be suspended.

40:18.932 --> 40:21.727
- The defendant is remanded...
- He can't do that.

40:21.810 --> 40:24.021
- Yes, he can.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

40:24.105 --> 40:26.167
- Bailiff, next case.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute!

40:26.191 --> 40:29.069
- Order! Order!
- You're letting him get away with it!

40:29.152 --> 40:31.572
- I said, order!
- You can't let him get away with that.

40:31.655 --> 40:35.577
- You are in contempt!
- This guy killed my kid!

40:37.996 --> 40:41.584
- You're crazy!
- Did you hear me? I said, order!

40:46.506 --> 40:50.010
- Restrain that man!
- You-

40:50.094 --> 40:54.265
- Restrain that man!
- You're nuts!

40:54.349 --> 40:57.853
Restrain him. You are in contempt!
Thirty days. Get him out of here.

41:39.276 --> 41:41.946
Here you go, sweetheart.

41:42.947 --> 41:44.950
Right here.

41:58.049 --> 42:01.469
You're home, sweetheart.

42:01.553 --> 42:03.722
Oh, look.

42:19.490 --> 42:21.618
Hold up here.

42:21.701 --> 42:24.204
You wanna open 19,Joe?

42:34.091 --> 42:37.136
Come on. Right over here.

42:44.603 --> 42:46.606
Have a nice day.

42:46.689 --> 42:48.691
You wanna close 19?

43:09.382 --> 43:11.677
You think we got enough money?

43:16.224 --> 43:18.560
You got it?
Yeah.

43:19.561 --> 43:21.855
Tell your friends I got
some good shit later on.

43:26.402 --> 43:29.156
All right, fuck off.

43:29.239 --> 43:31.867
See you later.
Why don't we split it up?

43:51.265 --> 43:53.267
You're in my way, bro.

43:54.435 --> 43:56.396
No shit.

44:31.938 --> 44:34.983
Fucker! What the fuck
is your problem, man?

44:38.362 --> 44:41.157
You all right?
Yeah, man. I'm cool.

44:43.243 --> 44:46.371
Like this.
Come on, man.

44:53.463 --> 44:55.543
Fucking bitch. Go get him.
You sure you're all right?

44:55.591 --> 44:57.635
I'm all right.

46:16.894 --> 46:18.897
What's your problem?

46:30.577 --> 46:33.998
What the fuck is wrong
with you? You ain't shit.

46:34.081 --> 46:38.253
What the fuck is wrong with you,
you big fuckin' dope?

46:38.336 --> 46:41.298
You better go back to that guy
in the wheelchair.

46:41.382 --> 46:44.635
You couldn't catch my sister,
you big fuckin' dummy.

47:54.676 --> 47:57.262
Save some for me, Burke.

48:20.039 --> 48:22.042
Right over there.

48:34.515 --> 48:37.476
What the fuck do you want?
You.

48:37.560 --> 48:40.605
Why don't you guys
leave him alone?

48:43.442 --> 48:45.444
What's the matter with you?

48:45.528 --> 48:48.489
All we're trying to do
is make him feel at home.

48:48.573 --> 48:50.617
Come on.

48:53.954 --> 48:55.956
See you later, pal.

49:06.594 --> 49:10.098
You know, if I were you,
I'd watch myself.

49:10.182 --> 49:12.184
I didn't ask you nothing.

49:14.270 --> 49:16.939
You're pretty hostile
to be a white ass.

49:17.023 --> 49:19.651
I got a right to be
anything I want.

49:21.194 --> 49:25.074
Man, you're on the rock.
You ain't got no rights.

49:25.157 --> 49:27.202
You’re just another nigger.

49:27.285 --> 49:30.914
And just one more word.

49:30.998 --> 49:34.418
Take that pitiful look
off your face...

49:34.502 --> 49:36.713
or you won't make it
through the day.

50:00.741 --> 50:03.202
I'm tired of watching you
dealing dope in our neighborhood.

50:04.704 --> 50:07.264
Maybe the man can't do nothing
about it, but we sure as hell can.

50:08.333 --> 50:10.878
Who supplies you?
I ain't telling you shit.

50:11.921 --> 50:17.177
All right, you don't want to
talk to me, talk to them.

50:36.575 --> 50:39.870
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

50:41.581 --> 50:43.917
Come on, cool it. Cool it.

50:46.295 --> 50:48.589
All right, you ready
to talk to me now?

50:48.714 --> 50:51.801
Go fuck yourself.
Still want to play, huh?

50:51.884 --> 50:54.012
All right, fuck, play Superman.

50:55.472 --> 51:01.562
No! No!

51:01.646 --> 51:03.398
Ohh! Ahh!

51:03.481 --> 51:07.778
Talk, punk!
Give me a name! A name!

51:07.862 --> 51:13.118
- I want a name! Talk, punk!
- It's Horace. It's Horace. Horace the pimp.

51:13.201 --> 51:15.579
He drives a silver Caddy.

51:15.662 --> 51:18.624
He hangs out at the Plaza.

51:25.048 --> 51:27.593
You should have said all that at first.

51:43.320 --> 51:47.241
They's all window shopping
tonight, baby.

51:47.325 --> 51:49.661
They're all fags.

51:49.744 --> 51:51.746
Tell that to Horace, gal.

51:53.916 --> 51:57.211
We ain't made a dime tonight.

51:57.336 --> 52:00.340
Here's that good-for-nothing-
You better get back over there.

52:24.452 --> 52:26.162
How much money you got?

52:26.245 --> 52:28.748
I got it for you.

52:37.091 --> 52:40.053
Don't get funky with me, bitch.

52:40.137 --> 52:43.099
There ain't no action
out there tonight, Horace.

52:43.224 --> 52:48.271
- It's spooky out there. Something's wrong.
- I don't give a shit. Bring me some money.

52:48.396 --> 52:50.357
But, Horace
- Get out there and get me some money.

52:50.482 --> 52:54.320
Now get the fuck out and get
me some goddamn money. But-

52:56.448 --> 52:58.658
Take that shit.

53:00.869 --> 53:03.497
Damn recession.

53:03.581 --> 53:07.043
How the fuck do they - they expect a
working man to make a goddamn living?

55:12.232 --> 55:15.403
Damn it.
Son of a bitch.

55:20.659 --> 55:22.745
Sucker.
Just bring it, sucker.

55:39.890 --> 55:44.270
Get me out of here!
Get me out of here!

56:05.670 --> 56:07.672
Have a party.

56:58.524 --> 57:01.235
On your knees, sucker.

57:01.319 --> 57:03.738
Did you hear what he said? Aah!

57:38.362 --> 57:40.365
You bastard!

58:16.532 --> 58:18.993
Hey, man, I'm bleeding.

58:19.077 --> 58:22.206
What the hell
is going on here, man?

58:22.289 --> 58:24.875
What the fuck did you
do my car like that for, man?

58:24.959 --> 58:27.462
Who are you dealing for, Horace?

58:29.005 --> 58:32.092
What's wrong with you guys?
Crazy?

58:32.176 --> 58:37.056
I'm dealing for myself, man. Now
fuck off. Who put you up to this?

58:37.140 --> 58:40.978
Sly Jones?
You workin' for him?

58:42.813 --> 58:45.316
Look, I got a roll, Jack.

58:45.399 --> 58:47.527
It's all yours, man.

58:47.610 --> 58:51.865
Who's your supplier? You ain't
smart enough to deal for yourself.

58:51.949 --> 58:54.285
Your mama ain't smart
enough to deal by herself.

58:57.497 --> 59:01.919
Punk, we'll break you into so many pieces,
they won't be able to put you back together.

59:02.002 --> 59:04.046
Now give us a name!

59:04.130 --> 59:07.008
Man, I can't.
I can't do no shit like that, man.

59:08.051 --> 59:11.555
Please, man.

59:12.640 --> 59:15.727
Please, man. Don't make
- Don't make me do no shit like this, man.

59:15.852 --> 59:18.188
You guys are going to
get me killed, man.

59:23.319 --> 59:25.363
Okay, man.

59:25.447 --> 59:31.120
I'm dealing for my main man,
Mr. T.

59:31.203 --> 59:35.667
Mr. T? Who the hell is Mr. T?
Spell it out, punk!

59:35.750 --> 59:39.171
Man, I can't-
Please don't make me do this, man.

59:39.254 --> 59:42.592
You guys talking suicide, man.

59:50.184 --> 59:52.812
Thomas.

59:52.895 --> 59:55.524
Thomas Stokes, man.

59:59.904 --> 01:00:04.910
Just because I dress well and I live well, does
that mean that I'm involved with sex or narcotics?

01:00:04.993 --> 01:00:07.997
Dudes like Stokes don't get caught, man.

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:11.542
Just a spoke.
It's the wheel I want. Come on.

01:00:30.314 --> 01:00:33.068
Yeah, all right, fine. Good.

01:01:00.683 --> 01:01:03.145
All right, let's go.

01:01:23.794 --> 01:01:25.671
Hey, what is it? Hey.

01:01:27.215 --> 01:01:30.010
What is it?
Who are you?

01:01:30.093 --> 01:01:34.431
What do you want?
Hey, whoa, brother. Whoa.

01:01:34.515 --> 01:01:38.686
Whoa, brother. Is this what
you want? Here, take it.

01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:42.775
What is it, man? Hey.

01:01:42.858 --> 01:01:44.694
Don't you know who I am?

01:01:46.654 --> 01:01:49.032
Yeah, I know who you are.

01:02:08.847 --> 01:02:11.517
Eddie, don't come back here.

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:15.647
And whatever you have to do outside,
don't get caught,

01:02:15.730 --> 01:02:18.400
because you don't want
your ass back in here.

01:02:19.735 --> 01:02:21.904
Come on, Marino! Move it!

01:03:29.108 --> 01:03:31.235
I want him.

01:04:25.716 --> 01:04:27.719
Rosie.

01:04:29.721 --> 01:04:32.850
Hey, Rosie. Rosie!

01:04:32.933 --> 01:04:35.686
What the hell is taking so long?
Cono man.

01:04:37.063 --> 01:04:39.608
I'm coming, papi.

01:04:39.691 --> 01:04:42.653
And have I got a surprise for you.

01:04:42.736 --> 01:04:44.739
Look what I have.

01:04:45.781 --> 01:04:47.700
I have this...

01:04:47.784 --> 01:04:50.704
and this.

01:04:52.456 --> 01:04:54.875
Will you get over here?
Come here.

01:05:00.549 --> 01:05:04.053
Eddie, can you handle that?

01:05:15.191 --> 01:05:17.527
Get over here.

01:05:17.611 --> 01:05:19.738
Yes.

01:05:43.307 --> 01:05:45.602
Who's that?
I don't know.

01:05:45.685 --> 01:05:48.105
Negra, abre la puerta.

01:05:48.188 --> 01:05:50.107
I don't know who it is.
Negra?

01:05:50.232 --> 01:05:52.360
Who the fuck is that?
Abre la puerta.

01:05:52.443 --> 01:05:54.445
Negra.

01:05:54.529 --> 01:05:57.991
I'm gonna give you some Negra right in the
lip, mother fucker. I'm gonna light you up.

01:06:01.162 --> 01:06:03.873
Hey, man! Hey, come on.
Take it easy.

01:06:03.957 --> 01:06:04.958
Girl, girl.
Come on.

01:06:05.041 --> 01:06:08.379
- Hey, hey, what are you guys crazy?
What are you doing, man?

01:06:08.462 --> 01:06:10.172
Come on.

01:06:10.297 --> 01:06:12.091
Hey, come-Hey.

01:06:12.175 --> 01:06:14.678
Hey, man. Hey, what are you
guys doing, man? Take it-

01:06:14.761 --> 01:06:17.055
Hey, what the hell is-
No, man. No.

01:06:17.139 --> 01:06:19.016
- You killed my son.
- No! No!

01:06:22.645 --> 01:06:26.817
Prago did it, man. It wasn't me.
You got the wrong guy, I swear.

01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:28.944
Man, I didn't shoot your kid.

01:06:29.028 --> 01:06:32.866
You got the wrong guy. No,
man, wait, wait. Mister, please.

01:07:01.775 --> 01:07:04.778
Let's go.

01:08:02.429 --> 01:08:05.016
Oh, brother, what a mess.

01:08:05.141 --> 01:08:08.311
I want all these reports directly to me.

01:08:11.774 --> 01:08:14.026
How do we release this?

01:08:14.110 --> 01:08:17.154
Exactly like I told you inside.
Another junkie hit.

01:08:17.238 --> 01:08:19.866
You know it's not.

01:08:19.950 --> 01:08:21.868
You want to give me a minute?

01:08:21.952 --> 01:08:24.663
I'll be standing by the door.
Okay.

01:08:26.291 --> 01:08:28.376
You trying to tell me
how to do my job?

01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:30.045
You know what happened in there.

01:08:30.170 --> 01:08:33.090
I damn well know what happened in
there. So, what are we doing about it?

01:08:33.174 --> 01:08:37.261
We're keeping it quiet. Do you
want to go to the newspapers? Fine.

01:08:37.345 --> 01:08:39.848
Then they'll make heroes
out of these guys.

01:08:39.932 --> 01:08:43.685
Then you can have one of these
every week. Is that what you want?

01:08:47.441 --> 01:08:49.401
Yes? Can I help you?
Yeah.

01:08:49.484 --> 01:08:52.154
I'd like a room pass to 67.

01:08:53.656 --> 01:08:55.825
That's, uh, Vickie Marino.

01:08:55.951 --> 01:08:59.162
I'm sorry. You'll have to speak
to Dr. Fallon. Wait a minute.

01:08:59.246 --> 01:09:02.086
This is my wife. And I was here before
and they wouldn't let me see her.

01:09:02.166 --> 01:09:04.627
I- I'm not sure why, but they-

01:09:04.711 --> 01:09:07.881
Doctor, what the hell's goin' on
around here? I want to see my wife.

01:09:09.049 --> 01:09:13.720
I'm sorry, Mr. Marino,
but, uh, you can't see your wife.

01:09:15.180 --> 01:09:17.184
Why not?

01:09:19.103 --> 01:09:21.856
Because, uh,
she doesn't want to see you.

01:09:26.944 --> 01:09:29.156
Well, excuse me, young man.

01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:31.576
It's clearing up very well.

01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:37.041
We're waiting for the results of the-

01:09:37.124 --> 01:09:39.292
Miss Yvonne Conway.

01:09:39.377 --> 01:09:42.796
Miss Yvonne Conway, extension-

01:09:50.807 --> 01:09:54.645
Vickie.
No. No.

01:09:54.770 --> 01:09:57.189
Vickie.
Don't touch me, please.

01:09:57.273 --> 01:10:01.611
Don't say that, honey.
Look, it's gonna be all right.

01:10:01.736 --> 01:10:05.282
We can do something about it
now. It's gonna be all right?

01:10:06.325 --> 01:10:08.661
Look at me.
Just look at me.

01:10:08.786 --> 01:10:10.121
Don't. Don't.
Look at me.

01:10:10.204 --> 01:10:12.624
See me. Look at me.

01:10:12.707 --> 01:10:15.461
I know it was horrible,
honey, but-

01:10:16.754 --> 01:10:20.592
Nobody helped us.
We were alone.

01:10:20.675 --> 01:10:22.970
And you blame me?

01:10:25.055 --> 01:10:27.058
Vickie, look it-
Where are you going?

01:10:27.183 --> 01:10:30.937
I am not going back there. Never.
Okay.

01:10:33.232 --> 01:10:35.818
I don't feel anything...

01:10:37.278 --> 01:10:39.280
for us...

01:10:40.991 --> 01:10:43.911
anymore.
Please, Vick.

01:10:43.994 --> 01:10:45.997
Honey.

01:10:49.584 --> 01:10:53.297
It was the husband.
I saw the entire bunch.

01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:56.843
Rico? Rico gone?

01:11:00.347 --> 01:11:02.683
Bastards.

01:11:02.766 --> 01:11:08.565
We can't let them walk over us.
Get the brothers together. Ah, shit!

01:11:57.914 --> 01:12:00.459
How does it look?
Nobody's around.

01:12:00.543 --> 01:12:02.545
Check the roofs?
Yes, sir.

01:12:02.628 --> 01:12:04.631
Let's check over there.

01:12:05.715 --> 01:12:09.720
Sure we're in the right place?
Positive.

01:12:09.845 --> 01:12:12.890
What was the complaint?
Prowlers.

01:12:20.566 --> 01:12:22.694
It's pretty quiet.

01:12:22.777 --> 01:12:26.615
Yeah. Bet it was some prank call.

01:12:34.666 --> 01:12:36.543
Oh, shit!

01:12:37.544 --> 01:12:39.505
God-

01:14:30.052 --> 01:14:32.596
Hey, buddy.

01:14:34.181 --> 01:14:36.226
How ya doing?

01:14:37.811 --> 01:14:40.063
Wonder what happened to you.
How's it going?

01:14:41.857 --> 01:14:44.068
Vickie's not coming back,
that's how it's going.

01:14:45.278 --> 01:14:47.197
I see.

01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:49.320
You blame yourself, huh?
Is that why you’re running?

01:14:49.366 --> 01:14:52.328
I'm getting out of here
as fast as I can. That's it.

01:14:54.622 --> 01:14:58.251
Look at this. Ten years of my fuckin'
life. What is it? Plastic shit.

01:15:04.884 --> 01:15:07.137
There's got to be someplace.
I don't know where, Nick,

01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:11.100
but someplace where they can't come along and
kick your ass anytime they feel like it.

01:15:14.187 --> 01:15:17.232
- I don't know anymore.
- Yeah, man, I know how you feel.

01:15:17.316 --> 01:15:19.610
No, you don't.

01:15:27.828 --> 01:15:31.249
My neighbors, they all saw what
happened. They didn't do shit.

01:15:33.334 --> 01:15:37.089
Forget it, Eddie. They're victims, man.
They gave up a long time ago.

01:15:37.172 --> 01:15:39.717
Everybody's a victim.
So what?

01:15:40.801 --> 01:15:43.471
You're still walking around
in the dark, man.

01:15:44.514 --> 01:15:46.391
You want to run?

01:15:46.475 --> 01:15:48.394
Go ahead.

01:15:48.477 --> 01:15:51.689
After you, then Burke,

01:15:51.773 --> 01:15:54.276
Ramon, maybe me.

01:15:54.359 --> 01:15:56.028
But I'll tell you this.

01:15:56.111 --> 01:16:00.324
Sooner or later, man, we're gonna
run out of places to hide.

01:16:00.408 --> 01:16:02.369
What do we do then, huh?

01:16:02.452 --> 01:16:06.540
Climb on some high mountain
where it's nice and safe?

01:16:06.624 --> 01:16:08.626
Wrong.

01:16:11.045 --> 01:16:14.341
After they finish turning
this neighborhood into a cesspool,

01:16:14.424 --> 01:16:18.930
what makes you think they're not gonna look up
at that high mountain of ours and want that too.

01:16:19.013 --> 01:16:21.725
The word is out on the street, man,

01:16:21.808 --> 01:16:24.311
the bottom is about to fall out.

01:16:24.394 --> 01:16:28.316
They want us bad.
But they're coming after you first.

01:16:28.399 --> 01:16:30.318
These are our homes.

01:16:30.401 --> 01:16:34.615
We give them up, we got nothing.

01:16:34.698 --> 01:16:38.202
Fight for it, Eddie.
Fight for it!

01:17:00.353 --> 01:17:03.232
Hey, man, what's wrong
with you? You crazy?

01:17:03.315 --> 01:17:05.401
Stay out of the street!

01:17:33.309 --> 01:17:35.269
You got a problem, chump?

01:17:38.315 --> 01:17:40.108
Fuck.

01:17:41.777 --> 01:17:43.571
Damn.

01:18:12.021 --> 01:18:15.316
Come on, man.

01:18:20.406 --> 01:18:23.159
What the fuck are you doing?

01:18:23.242 --> 01:18:26.288
You're fucking up my car.

01:18:26.413 --> 01:18:28.373
This your car, huh?
Yeah.

01:18:28.457 --> 01:18:31.377
Give me the keys.
Give me the fuckin' keys, man!

01:18:31.460 --> 01:18:33.922
What are you doing?
I'll move it. I'll move it!

01:18:41.430 --> 01:18:46.353
That guy just stole my fuckin' car!
He stole my car! What are you, a cop?

01:18:46.478 --> 01:18:48.397
He stole my car!

01:18:50.858 --> 01:18:53.153
Whoo!

01:18:53.236 --> 01:18:56.240
All right. Come on, sucker.
You want to do it?

01:18:58.826 --> 01:19:00.495
Whoo! Ha. Get and go!

01:19:16.221 --> 01:19:18.724
WBLS, New York.

01:19:23.188 --> 01:19:25.816
All right, chump, you
wanna play? Come on, let's go.

01:21:42.644 --> 01:21:46.023
Go get 'em, baby!
Go get 'em!

01:22:03.460 --> 01:22:06.171
Son of a bitch!

01:22:13.096 --> 01:22:14.264
Shit.

01:23:31.355 --> 01:23:33.858
Come on. Come on.

01:23:36.110 --> 01:23:38.279
Come on.
I'll kill ya!

01:23:45.455 --> 01:23:48.959
You killed my son.
Fuck him.

01:23:49.042 --> 01:23:51.712
Go ahead, man. Go ahead.
This don't mean shit to me.

01:23:51.795 --> 01:23:54.632
It does to me.

01:24:23.291 --> 01:24:25.377
Good night, Your Honor.

01:25:03.296 --> 01:25:06.091
The court sentences you to two years.

01:25:06.174 --> 01:25:09.053
Sentence to be suspended.
