00:03.504 --> 00:05.273
*

00:09.843 --> 00:12.346
(rock music playing faintly
over speakers)

00:12.380 --> 00:13.781
(horse neighs)

00:15.783 --> 00:17.218
DAWSON:
Let me guess.

00:17.251 --> 00:18.586
"Fun"?

00:18.619 --> 00:20.654
(music stops)

00:20.688 --> 00:23.224
You like this place so much,
you just had to tell the world.

00:23.257 --> 00:25.126
I get it. I like it here, too.

00:27.561 --> 00:28.829
This is Sergeant Dawson
calling in

00:28.862 --> 00:30.231
vandalism on Pine Trail.

00:30.264 --> 00:32.066
Suspect fleeing north
on foot.

00:32.100 --> 00:33.367
DISPATCHER:
Copy that, Sergeant.

00:33.401 --> 00:35.169
Told you, Jasper.
This place is fun.

00:35.203 --> 00:36.204
(clicks tongue)

00:38.206 --> 00:41.442
Give it up, kid,
before you get hurt!

00:42.776 --> 00:43.744
(groans)

00:43.777 --> 00:45.779
(Jasper neighs)

00:45.813 --> 00:47.281
DAWSON:
Jasper, what's wrong?

00:48.716 --> 00:51.219
(Jasper neighing)

00:51.252 --> 00:53.287
Easy, boy. Easy.

00:53.321 --> 00:54.555
Whoa, buddy. What's up?

00:54.588 --> 00:56.124
(snorting)

00:56.157 --> 00:58.126
(man screams in distance)

00:58.159 --> 01:01.162
Good ear, Jasper.
We better check that out.

01:04.298 --> 01:06.200
Park police!
Anybody out here?

01:08.902 --> 01:11.505
This is Dawson. Hold me out
at East Portico Stones.

01:11.539 --> 01:13.541
Got a possible disturbance.

01:13.574 --> 01:14.842
DISPATCHER:
Copy that, Dawson.

01:14.875 --> 01:16.444
State the nature
of the disturbance.

01:16.477 --> 01:17.678
Whoa.

01:17.711 --> 01:19.680
Steady.

01:19.713 --> 01:22.550
Sergeant Dawson,
do you require assistance?

01:24.252 --> 01:25.686
Dawson, do you copy?

01:27.888 --> 01:29.290
Sergeant Dawson,
do you need backup?

01:29.323 --> 01:31.625
Sergeant?

01:31.659 --> 01:33.661
*

02:04.358 --> 02:05.793
First aid.

02:05.826 --> 02:07.495
Report writing.

02:07.528 --> 02:09.197
And sexual harassment.

02:09.230 --> 02:10.431
QUINN: Sexual harassment
training, really?

02:10.464 --> 02:12.800
Did you even learn anything?

02:12.833 --> 02:14.868
"If you make a pass,
never harass."

02:15.836 --> 02:16.470
That is not a thing.

02:16.504 --> 02:18.406
Did you even take the class?

02:18.439 --> 02:19.773
Please. I taught the class.

02:19.807 --> 02:20.708
Oh, right. Yeah.

02:20.741 --> 02:23.444
No, he actually got up
in front of the room.

02:23.477 --> 02:26.680
The instructor lost her voice
and asked for volunteers.

02:26.714 --> 02:27.548
Was she hot?

02:28.282 --> 02:29.383
Case closed.

02:29.417 --> 02:31.452
McGEE: All right,
we are almost done

02:31.485 --> 02:33.187
with these
in-service training reports.

02:33.221 --> 02:34.087
Almost?

02:34.121 --> 02:37.625
Uh, we just did
six classes in three days.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.360
Yeah, because
our senior field agent

02:39.393 --> 02:40.694
screwed the pooch.

02:40.728 --> 02:42.330
Look, I'm sorry; human resources

02:42.363 --> 02:43.797
used to keep track
of all the scheduling.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.666
It's not my fault
that they changed the system

02:45.699 --> 02:47.268
and made it my responsibility.

02:47.301 --> 02:49.803
So, we're pretty much
saving your job.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.372
Well, point is,

02:51.405 --> 02:52.306
we're getting caught up.

02:52.340 --> 02:53.874
And?

02:53.907 --> 02:55.809
And we won't have to
face any penalties.

02:55.843 --> 02:56.677
And?

02:58.746 --> 03:00.714
And thank you for
saving my job.

03:00.748 --> 03:02.916
Seriously. But...

03:02.950 --> 03:03.951
Nope. No buts.

03:03.984 --> 03:05.453
We still have to do the O-CAT.

03:05.486 --> 03:07.388
Mm!
(Quinn groans)

03:07.421 --> 03:09.223
What is that, like,
animal safety?

03:09.257 --> 03:11.325
No, it's pepper spray training.

03:11.359 --> 03:14.228
Every couple years,
we all have to get recertified.

03:14.262 --> 03:16.297
Yeah, which includes
getting sprayed.

03:16.330 --> 03:17.931
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'll
go easy on you guys.

03:17.965 --> 03:18.766
Oh, no, no.
No, this is your fault.

03:18.799 --> 03:20.334
No, you don't get
to spray on us.

03:20.368 --> 03:21.335
Who else is
gonna do it?

03:21.369 --> 03:22.336
You want help?

03:22.370 --> 03:24.272
Uh, we're okay.
No way. What?

03:24.305 --> 03:26.307
Suit yourself. Grab your gear.

03:26.340 --> 03:26.940
We got a body?

03:26.974 --> 03:28.709
In Rock Creek Park.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.811
(camera clicking)

03:30.844 --> 03:33.581
BISHOP:
Gunnery Sergeant Remi Tanner.

03:33.614 --> 03:36.717
We've seen a lot in this park,
but this marble thing...

03:36.750 --> 03:38.452
that's a first.

03:38.486 --> 03:39.887
Crushed by an ancient temple?

03:39.920 --> 03:42.590
DUCKY: Well, that is
technically correct, Alex.

03:42.623 --> 03:47.995
While not religious in nature
and certainly not ancient,

03:48.028 --> 03:50.731
these stones were once
part of a temple

03:50.764 --> 03:52.600
built to honor democracy:

03:52.633 --> 03:54.502
the United States Capitol.

03:54.535 --> 03:57.771
In 1958,
the East Portico

03:57.805 --> 04:01.509
was remodeled and the
leftover stones stacked here.

04:01.542 --> 04:03.411
BISHOP: Hmm.
This far off the beaten path?

04:03.444 --> 04:05.346
I've never heard of this place.

04:05.379 --> 04:06.847
DUCKY:
It's a forgotten legacy.

04:06.880 --> 04:09.650
Ah, but these stones
witnessed the inauguration

04:09.683 --> 04:12.586
of every president
from, oh, Andrew Jackson

04:12.620 --> 04:14.522
to Dwight D. Eisenhower.

04:14.555 --> 04:17.525
They also witnessed the final
moments of our Marine's life.

04:17.558 --> 04:19.327
Killed by a little piece
of history.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.429
DUCKY:
Yes, but look here.

04:21.462 --> 04:23.697
Yeah, this man
put up quite a fight

04:23.731 --> 04:26.567
before being crushed
by government waste.

04:27.568 --> 04:29.370
DAWSON:
If there was a fight,

04:29.403 --> 04:30.871
Jasper heard it first.

04:30.904 --> 04:32.706
That's the only reason
I stopped to listen.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.708
We trust each
other's instincts.
(pats Jasper)

04:34.742 --> 04:36.577
TORRES: Does that include
finding dead bodies?

04:36.610 --> 04:37.545
DAWSON:
For everything.

04:37.578 --> 04:39.947
Trust makes mounted
police work possible.

04:39.980 --> 04:42.416
They're flight animals.
They run when they're scared.

04:42.450 --> 04:43.751
How does that work
in the big city?

04:43.784 --> 04:44.918
Well, it doesn't.
Right.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.754
We train them to
follow their riders.

04:46.787 --> 04:47.888
It could take years.

04:47.921 --> 04:50.624
But a mounted officer can
do more than ten on foot.

04:50.658 --> 04:53.394
From crowd
control to P.R.

04:53.427 --> 04:55.563
People are more willing to
approach someone on a horse.

04:55.596 --> 04:57.331
How does the horse feel
about that?

04:57.365 --> 04:59.066
(Dawson chuckles)
Well, they're social animals.

04:59.099 --> 05:00.401
TORRES:
Damn, Gibbs.

05:00.434 --> 05:01.602
Seems like
opposites attract, huh?

05:01.635 --> 05:03.371
(chuckles)
You bring treats, Agent Gibbs?

05:03.404 --> 05:04.772
TORRES:
What's in your pocket?

05:04.805 --> 05:07.375
Just leftover breakfast,
but it's not vegetarian, Jasper.

05:07.408 --> 05:08.509
I am sorry about that.

05:08.542 --> 05:10.478
(chuckles)
Thanks, Dawson.

05:10.511 --> 05:13.347
Come on, Jasper.
Let's go.

05:13.381 --> 05:15.716
Well, now we know that horses
don't like jacket jerky.

05:17.418 --> 05:19.487
(horse neighs)
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.789
It's okay.
Jody only attacks criminals.

05:21.822 --> 05:24.625
Yeah, I always knew the ladies
always loved the bad boys.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.627
Uh, actually, Jody's male.

05:26.660 --> 05:29.430
He's named after one of
our fallen park police officers.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.502
What are you doing, checking?

05:34.535 --> 05:36.003
(laughs) No, I'm just
not a horse person, okay?

05:36.036 --> 05:37.505
COLE:
That's all right.

05:37.538 --> 05:39.440
They're not horses.
They're cops.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.877
Okay, what do we have?

05:43.911 --> 05:46.079
Well, there's footprints
around the body.

05:46.113 --> 05:48.416
McGEE: Untraceable, but it shows
there was two attackers.

05:48.449 --> 05:50.651
Found a cell phone
case, but no phone,

05:50.684 --> 05:53.421
and $500 cash in
the victim's wallet.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.155
Mugging interrupted
by Mister Ed?

05:55.188 --> 05:56.924
Well, it was late
and the park was closed.

05:56.957 --> 05:59.560
Exactly, so what was our Marine
doing here in the first place?

05:59.593 --> 06:01.962
DAWSON:
Agent Gibbs, over here!

06:01.995 --> 06:04.532
Let's widen the search area.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.602
Sorry, I thought Jasper

06:08.636 --> 06:10.604
was nosing after some
crab apples, until I saw

06:10.638 --> 06:11.972
this burlap stuck in here.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.709
Looks like blood, so I
thought it might be evidence.

06:22.483 --> 06:23.517
Let's see.

06:27.655 --> 06:28.989
(grunts)

06:37.030 --> 06:38.666
DAWSON:
Animal skulls.

06:40.668 --> 06:41.669
What the hell?

06:50.243 --> 06:52.646
BISHOP: The lesser
spot-nosed monkey,

06:52.680 --> 06:54.748
native to West African forests.

06:54.782 --> 06:56.750
(laughs)
Now, that's a cute animal.

06:56.784 --> 06:58.786
BISHOP: They were the
source of the skulls

06:58.819 --> 07:00.087
found at the crime scene.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.755
Not so cute.

07:01.789 --> 07:05.092
Our victim,
Gunnery Sergeant Tanner,

07:05.125 --> 07:07.060
was single and had
a spotless record.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.897
He was part of
Marine Corps Forces Africa.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.899
Just spent three
months in Liberia,

07:11.932 --> 07:14.134
where his unit was sent
to train wildlife rangers.

07:14.167 --> 07:15.836
BISHOP:
I've heard of that.

07:15.869 --> 07:18.772
U.S. Marines teach
non-lethal raid tactics--

07:18.806 --> 07:20.674
flash-bangs, rubber bullets.

07:20.708 --> 07:22.676
Apprehending poachers
is dangerous business.

07:22.710 --> 07:24.211
BISHOP: Well, these monkeys
aren't endangered,

07:24.244 --> 07:27.681
but they're part of the illegal
animal trade and sold as pets.

07:27.715 --> 07:28.849
Not dead ones.

07:28.882 --> 07:30.784
Why the skulls?

07:30.818 --> 07:31.985
Maybe they're a message.

07:32.019 --> 07:34.922
Revenge for Marine involvement
in Africa?

07:34.955 --> 07:36.724
Well, that still doesn't
explain why the guy

07:36.757 --> 07:39.493
was in the park
with a wallet full of cash.

07:39.527 --> 07:40.828
Maybe the skulls were his.

07:40.861 --> 07:42.530
What? Why?

07:42.563 --> 07:43.697
McGEE:
Skulls are valuable.

07:43.731 --> 07:45.666
There's an entire
American subculture

07:45.699 --> 07:46.867
obsessed with
bone collecting.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.569
How do you know that?

07:48.602 --> 07:51.071
He dated Abby.

07:51.104 --> 07:52.606
Ah.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.542
I'm not saying the guy
killed the monkeys himself,

07:54.575 --> 07:57.511
but maybe he brought home
some souvenirs to sell.

07:57.545 --> 07:59.046
And then things went bad.

07:59.079 --> 08:00.714
Phone records
night of the murder.

08:00.748 --> 08:02.149
Uh, victim's
missing cell phone

08:02.182 --> 08:03.751
has since been turned
off or destroyed,

08:03.784 --> 08:04.685
but the last three calls

08:04.718 --> 08:07.087
were from the same
person: Phoebe Spitz.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.689
Pick her up.
Well, Abby says

08:08.722 --> 08:09.790
Miss Spitz is already
on her way in.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.992
Abby?
McGEE:
Yeah, apparently,
she and Miss Spitz

08:12.025 --> 08:13.794
are friends;
they spoke this morning.

08:13.827 --> 08:14.895
About what, skulls?

08:14.928 --> 08:17.765
I have no idea, boss.
Abby said she'll explain later.

08:17.798 --> 08:20.267
Tim, got your message and
picked up those pepper sprays.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.770
I'll have everybody sprayed
and done by the week's end.

08:22.803 --> 08:24.071
You're a lifesaver, Clayton.
Thank you.

08:24.772 --> 08:26.907
Wait. What's happening?

08:27.941 --> 08:30.077
He put Reeves in charge? Why?

08:30.110 --> 08:32.245
Well, McGee claims that

08:32.279 --> 08:35.816
as British MI6, Clayton
is an independent party.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.719
Oh, I'm not giving
either one of them the pleasure.

08:38.752 --> 08:40.087
Look, we'll spray
each other.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.823
Huh? You trust me.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.992
Hey, sorry I'm late.
I had to update my presentation.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.293
What presentation?

08:46.326 --> 08:49.863
Veterans Animal
Patrol United.

08:49.897 --> 08:52.766
It's an organization
of U.S. military veterans

08:52.800 --> 08:55.869
who are dedicated to protecting
wildlife around the world.

08:55.903 --> 08:57.838
Oh, cool.
That's what I said.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.840
So then I joined the board
of directors last year

08:59.873 --> 09:02.710
and I met the founder,
Miss Phoebe Spitz.

09:03.944 --> 09:05.646
Doesn't she look awesome?

09:05.679 --> 09:06.947
I love the camo.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.348
Abby, I hate that picture.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.851
I know, but it gets
everybody's attention.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.753
The photo helps with awareness,

09:12.786 --> 09:14.888
but it doesn't exactly
capture our values.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.356
You mean like
death from above?

09:16.389 --> 09:18.592
Peaceful conservation.

09:18.626 --> 09:19.860
When I retired
from the Marine Corps,

09:19.893 --> 09:20.994
I made it my life's work.

09:21.028 --> 09:23.163
I was trying to
make it Tanner's, too.

09:23.196 --> 09:24.998
I called last night
to recruit him.

09:25.032 --> 09:25.999
Three times?

09:26.033 --> 09:27.167
Tanner kept
hanging up on me.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.836
I thought it was
a bad connection.

09:28.869 --> 09:30.971
Then Abby told me
what happened.

09:31.004 --> 09:33.373
It's horrible.
He was a good guy.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.208
Was he an animal lover,
as well?

09:35.242 --> 09:37.010
Not at first, you know.

09:37.044 --> 09:39.713
When Tanner's unit was
first stationed in Liberia,

09:39.747 --> 09:42.783
he thought it was some kind of
hippie-dippie P.R. stunt.

09:42.816 --> 09:44.718
But then he was
able to witness

09:44.752 --> 09:45.886
these animals
in their natural habitat.

09:45.919 --> 09:49.322
He was amazed to find out
that elephants mourn their dead

09:49.356 --> 09:51.925
and rhinos dance
before they mate.

09:51.959 --> 09:52.893
Just like humans.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.095
PHOEBE: He was also
amazed at how easy it is

09:55.128 --> 09:56.897
for poachers
to kill these animals

09:56.930 --> 09:57.865
for their skins and ivory.

09:57.898 --> 10:00.333
That was done with a chainsaw.

10:00.367 --> 10:01.935
Oh, that's awful.

10:01.969 --> 10:03.403
So, did he tell you

10:03.436 --> 10:06.073
why he was in Rock Creek Park
last night?

10:06.106 --> 10:07.240
Yeah, with monkey skulls?

10:07.274 --> 10:10.243
No. Our conversations
were short.

10:10.277 --> 10:12.045
He's been playing
hard to get.

10:12.079 --> 10:14.347
Is it possible maybe he was
trying to sell them, the skulls?

10:14.381 --> 10:15.983
No way.

10:16.016 --> 10:18.118
Tanner may not have
committed to my organization,

10:18.151 --> 10:20.420
but he was committed
to these animals.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.389
I thought you said
this was about revenge.

10:22.422 --> 10:24.124
Well, I... possibly,

10:24.157 --> 10:26.827
if we knew who might
have a reason.

10:26.860 --> 10:27.995
Oh, I-I do. Here.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.000
Ousmane Best.

10:33.033 --> 10:35.202
He's a big-time poacher,
arrested last month.

10:35.235 --> 10:36.303
So, he's in prison?

10:36.336 --> 10:38.672
Yes, and Tanner's unit
put him there.

10:39.472 --> 10:40.941
Look, Best has
a network of smugglers

10:40.974 --> 10:42.843
all around the world.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.978
I wouldn't put it past him
to put out some kind of bounty.

10:45.012 --> 10:46.847
Did Tanner tell you
that last night?

10:46.880 --> 10:47.915
No.

10:47.948 --> 10:49.316
Like I told you,

10:49.349 --> 10:52.720
I have no idea
what was going on in that park.

10:57.057 --> 10:59.026
(horse neighs)

10:59.059 --> 11:00.728
(trash can lids banging)

11:00.761 --> 11:02.996
That's it. Good boy.

11:03.030 --> 11:05.933
TORRES:
All right. Thank you.

11:05.966 --> 11:07.300
MAN: Whoa, whoa.
(horse neighs)

11:07.334 --> 11:09.036
Bishop and McGee went
to the victim's apartment.

11:09.069 --> 11:10.403
All they found was his laptop.

11:13.774 --> 11:16.844
(horse snorting)

11:16.877 --> 11:19.747
I'm assuming this only
makes sense to horse people?

11:19.780 --> 11:21.014
Police horses have to train.

11:21.048 --> 11:22.716
Pushing the ball teaches them
to push a crowd,

11:22.750 --> 11:25.152
and the banging gets them
used to city sounds.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.154
You off duty?
Yeah, but I
usually stick around

11:27.187 --> 11:28.956
to help train the horses.

11:28.989 --> 11:31.191
And I heard you wanted to talk
about recent park activity.

11:31.224 --> 11:32.392
Yeah, crime patterns.

11:32.425 --> 11:33.761
Anything new? Unusual?

11:33.794 --> 11:34.995
Like animal trafficking?

11:35.028 --> 11:38.031
It's looking that way.
Disgusting.

11:38.065 --> 11:40.333
Can't say we find a lot of tusks
and furs laying around,

11:40.367 --> 11:42.002
but I would gladly sift
through crime reports

11:42.035 --> 11:43.871
if it helps catch them.

11:43.904 --> 11:45.105
Yeah, great.

11:45.138 --> 11:47.140
Yeah, that's it.
That's it.

11:47.174 --> 11:49.409
Horses are not dogs, man.

11:49.442 --> 11:51.411
You don't miss a thing.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.446
No, I'm saying,
cats and dogs I understand,

11:53.480 --> 11:56.149
but anything bigger
than a person,

11:56.183 --> 11:58.251
I mean, it's just not a pet.

11:58.285 --> 11:59.987
That's right.
They're livestock.

12:00.020 --> 12:01.488
COLE (over radio):
This is Officer Cole.

12:01.521 --> 12:03.857
Hold me out at Bingham Road
and Fern Trail.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.025
Suspicious activity.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.060
One suspect in custody.

12:07.094 --> 12:08.996
That's near your crime scene.

12:09.029 --> 12:11.031
Backup en route.
You drive, I'll point the way.

12:21.909 --> 12:23.276
Cole, copy.

12:23.310 --> 12:25.913
NELSON:
Um, I think they left.

12:29.382 --> 12:30.517
Who the hell are you?

12:30.550 --> 12:33.053
Under arrest, I think.

12:33.086 --> 12:36.089
One minute this officer
busts me for smoking a joint,

12:36.123 --> 12:37.524
the next he handcuffs me
to this bench

12:37.557 --> 12:39.026
and takes off on his horse.

12:41.094 --> 12:41.995
Why?

12:42.029 --> 12:44.364
I'm pretty sure
they were chasing someone,

12:44.397 --> 12:46.199
but I am kind of high.

12:46.233 --> 12:47.367
(gunfire in distance)

12:47.400 --> 12:50.303
Shots fired, shots fired.

12:50.337 --> 12:51.138
Stay here with him.

12:51.171 --> 12:53.206
DAWSON: Backup required
at Fern Trail.

12:53.240 --> 12:56.176
Cole. Cole.

12:56.209 --> 12:58.378
Oh, my God.

12:58.411 --> 13:01.114
Officer down, officer down.

13:01.148 --> 13:03.416
We need immediate medical
assistance at Bingham and Fern.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.052
Whoa, boy.
(neighing)

13:05.085 --> 13:06.119
Whoa, Jody.
Whoa.

13:06.153 --> 13:08.321
DISPATCHER: Dispatching EMT
to Bingham and Fern.

13:08.355 --> 13:10.090
(neighing continues)

13:10.123 --> 13:11.458
Okay, all right, Cole.

13:11.491 --> 13:13.060
I'm gonna apply some pressure.

13:13.093 --> 13:14.995
This may hurt.

13:15.028 --> 13:16.196
Gibbs, grab his bridal.

13:16.229 --> 13:17.330
Hold on, Cole.

13:17.364 --> 13:19.833
Whoa, whoa, Jody, whoa.
Help is coming.

13:21.034 --> 13:22.970
You're gonna be okay.

13:23.003 --> 13:24.137
(neighs softly)

13:24.171 --> 13:26.073
Uh, Dawson.

13:26.106 --> 13:27.841
Yeah?

13:27.875 --> 13:30.177
Call the vet, too.

13:30.210 --> 13:32.179
It's okay.

13:32.212 --> 13:34.047
Easy, now.

13:41.321 --> 13:44.024
I appreciate the update. Okay.

13:45.993 --> 13:49.329
Officer Cole is at Washington
General with two chest wounds.

13:49.362 --> 13:51.264
Doctors have
their hands full.

13:51.298 --> 13:53.033
(sighs)

13:53.066 --> 13:54.167
Any word on the horse?

13:54.201 --> 13:56.269
Yeah, he's being treated
at the stable.

13:56.303 --> 14:00.140
I don't understand how you guys
are so emotional over a horse.

14:00.173 --> 14:05.946
"A," I grew up on a farm and
horses are beautiful animals.

14:05.979 --> 14:09.349
And "B", these tears are
the end of pepper spray.

14:09.382 --> 14:10.450
Boom.
(chuckles)

14:10.483 --> 14:11.651
Wait, you guys let Reeves do it?

14:11.684 --> 14:13.020
Hell no.
(sniffles)

14:13.053 --> 14:14.421
I was merely a witness

14:14.454 --> 14:16.990
to a whole new universe
of foul language.

14:17.024 --> 14:18.591
Oh, yeah.
Quinn has a potty mouth.

14:18.625 --> 14:19.492
REEVES:
No, it was Ellie

14:19.526 --> 14:21.328
who raised the bar
to Olympic heights.

14:21.361 --> 14:22.495
QUINN:
Ah.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.164
Even I blushed.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.299
Well, I know six languages.
It's easy to get creative.

14:26.333 --> 14:28.035
REEVES:
Thank you.

14:28.068 --> 14:29.369
The international desk
keeps getting calls

14:29.402 --> 14:31.204
from the Liberian embassy.

14:31.238 --> 14:33.240
The ambassador wants to
meet with Director Vance.

14:33.273 --> 14:34.174
Uh, what for?

14:34.207 --> 14:35.542
They haven't
given me a reason.

14:35.575 --> 14:36.944
Just keeps
telling me it's urgent.

14:36.977 --> 14:38.145
Huh.

14:38.178 --> 14:39.346
Well, what happened
at the park?

14:39.379 --> 14:41.048
Well, Gibbs is talking
to the only guy

14:41.081 --> 14:42.349
who might be able
to tell us something.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.084
NELSON:
Well, I was kind of high.

14:44.117 --> 14:45.385
Things are a bit blurry.

14:45.418 --> 14:47.154
Yeah, like your
criminal record.

14:47.187 --> 14:48.956
Nelson, you were
arrested six years ago

14:48.989 --> 14:50.290
for airport drug
trafficking.

14:50.323 --> 14:51.224
You did prison time.

14:51.258 --> 14:52.625
I've changed now.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.165
So, what were you doing
near a murder scene?

14:58.198 --> 15:00.100
Murder?

15:00.133 --> 15:05.172
Whoa. Now, I mean, yes, I had
pot, but that's legal in D.C.

15:05.205 --> 15:08.175
And you'll find that bag weighs
exactly 1.9 ounces,

15:08.208 --> 15:09.242
so you can't arrest me.

15:09.276 --> 15:10.643
Unless we can prove
intent to sell.

15:10.677 --> 15:12.312
Even if I was selling--

15:12.345 --> 15:15.615
and that's not an admission--
I'm not getting rich.

15:15.648 --> 15:18.151
When I got out of prison,
I downsized.

15:18.185 --> 15:19.719
Ever hear of minimalism?

15:19.752 --> 15:22.222
I cut my dreadlocks and
got rid of everything I own.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.991
I only buy
what I need to live.

15:24.024 --> 15:25.993
I don't even have
a bank account. You can check.

15:26.026 --> 15:26.994
We did.

15:27.027 --> 15:28.328
Where were you last night?

15:28.361 --> 15:30.597
I was alone all night
in my tiny house.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.165
I park it all over.

15:32.199 --> 15:33.633
My carbon footprint is very low.

15:33.666 --> 15:35.568
Aside from smoking
like a chimney.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.204
That's the only reason
I got busted.

15:37.237 --> 15:38.238
McGEE: You lit up
in a public place.

15:38.271 --> 15:39.339
It's against the law.

15:39.372 --> 15:40.673
Apparently, horses can smell

15:40.707 --> 15:43.076
prime Kush for miles;
they caught me.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.377
And left you.
Oh, yeah.

15:44.411 --> 15:45.712
As he was writing me a ticket,

15:45.745 --> 15:47.414
the horse heard someone
in the bushes.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.382
It stopped and got real quiet.

15:49.416 --> 15:51.651
He. Horse is a he.

15:51.684 --> 15:56.089
Okay. He seemed to recognize
a scent or something

15:56.123 --> 15:57.290
and got fidgety.

15:57.324 --> 15:58.658
So, the officer
cuffed me to the bench

15:58.691 --> 16:00.393
and let the horse
lead the way.

16:00.427 --> 16:02.229
Then you guys showed up
and the gunshots started.

16:02.262 --> 16:03.763
Did you see the person?

16:03.796 --> 16:05.332
All I saw was a shadow.

16:05.365 --> 16:07.034
It happened real fast.

16:07.067 --> 16:08.435
That horse was
like a Scud missile.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.603
A stud missile.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.607
(laughing)

16:18.145 --> 16:20.047
Director Vance,

16:20.080 --> 16:22.149
Liberian Ambassador
Gabriel Moore.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.417
Ambassador Moore,
it's a pleasure.

16:24.451 --> 16:27.287
You are dismissed.

16:32.459 --> 16:34.394
Ambassador,
would you like to sit...

16:34.427 --> 16:37.330
Director Vance, my country was
in the news this morning,

16:37.364 --> 16:40.200
and the only reason I found out
was because I was watching.

16:40.233 --> 16:42.202
Why was my embassy
not first informed?

16:42.235 --> 16:45.638
The news reported the murder
of a decorated Marine.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.374
Who was working
with my government

16:47.407 --> 16:49.342
in Gola National Forest.

16:49.376 --> 16:51.544
Training wildlife rangers, yes,

16:51.578 --> 16:54.614
but he was killed
here in D.C.

16:54.647 --> 16:57.484
Ambassador, forgive me, but
your embassy was not very clear

16:57.517 --> 16:59.419
as to the nature
of this meeting.

16:59.452 --> 17:01.488
You have information
to help our case?

17:01.521 --> 17:02.789
I do not.

17:02.822 --> 17:04.624
Then I'm confused.
About what?

17:04.657 --> 17:06.359
About why you're angry
with NCIS.

17:06.393 --> 17:08.628
The victim was found
with animal skulls, huh?

17:08.661 --> 17:12.365
That was not reported
in the news.

17:12.399 --> 17:17.737
You will keep me informed
before anything is made public.

17:17.770 --> 17:20.540
Well...

17:22.609 --> 17:26.279
I report to
the Secretary of the Navy,

17:26.313 --> 17:27.547
but as a courtesy,

17:27.580 --> 17:29.749
I'll be happy to keep you
in the loop.

17:31.284 --> 17:32.752
I will keep you updated.

17:32.785 --> 17:36.323
It is my duty to make sure
my country and its people

17:36.356 --> 17:38.658
are fairly represented
on the world stage.

17:38.691 --> 17:40.627
What exactly are you expecting?

17:43.530 --> 17:46.499
I won't take up
any more of your time.

17:46.533 --> 17:47.534
Director.

17:53.506 --> 17:56.376
Agent Gibbs.

17:56.409 --> 17:59.412
Dawson. How you holding up?

17:59.446 --> 18:03.483
Cole just got out of surgery,
so it's... touch and go.

18:03.516 --> 18:05.818
But the doctors thought it
went better than expected.

18:05.852 --> 18:08.588
I know him, he's strong.
He'll make it through.

18:10.357 --> 18:13.493
Which is why he's gonna
need those riding boots back

18:13.526 --> 18:15.462
as soon as you finish
processing them.

18:15.495 --> 18:17.630
I also have Jody's tack
out in my truck.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.666
This is a joint
investigation now, right?

18:19.699 --> 18:20.767
Have a seat.

18:20.800 --> 18:24.204
I prefer an outdoor office.

18:24.237 --> 18:26.839
I meant to say
nice work with Jody.

18:26.873 --> 18:28.408
You didn't tell me
you were a horse guy.

18:28.441 --> 18:29.442
Yeah, that makes two of us.

18:29.476 --> 18:32.479
Something about you
standing next to a horse,

18:32.512 --> 18:33.646
that does seem symmetrical.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.582
Jody seemed to think so, too.

18:35.615 --> 18:38.318
That horse doesn't usually
take so easily to strangers.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.454
Was just following orders.

18:41.488 --> 18:43.856
Oh, I have this.

18:43.890 --> 18:46.626
The vet found this
in Jody's mouth.

18:49.196 --> 18:50.730
Hey, Quinn.

18:50.763 --> 18:52.332
What is that?

18:52.365 --> 18:54.401
It looks like bone or ivory.
(phone ringing)

18:54.434 --> 18:56.269
Did the horse eat anything
at the crime scene?

18:56.303 --> 18:57.337
That's why I thought
it would help.

18:57.370 --> 18:58.471
GIBBS:
Abbs, yeah.

18:58.505 --> 18:59.539
I'm on the way down.

18:59.572 --> 19:01.574
Right now.

19:04.611 --> 19:07.580
Dawson, you waiting
for an invitation?

19:07.614 --> 19:09.549
Well, the park is my office.
This is yours.

19:09.582 --> 19:12.485
Joint investigation.

19:12.519 --> 19:14.554
Come on, let's go.

19:14.587 --> 19:15.855
(elevator bell dings)

19:18.358 --> 19:19.726
Marine gunny's car.

19:19.759 --> 19:22.562
It was found parked in a lot
outside Rock Creek Park.

19:22.595 --> 19:24.464
So, he entered on foot.

19:24.497 --> 19:25.598
Dawson, park police.

19:25.632 --> 19:27.967
Abby, science police.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.636
Anything tell you why
he entered the park?

19:29.669 --> 19:33.473
I'm still working on it,
but this parking stub was found

19:33.506 --> 19:35.675
underneath one of
the windshield wiper blades.

19:35.708 --> 19:37.444
It's dated the night
that he died,

19:37.477 --> 19:38.811
but there's no address,

19:38.845 --> 19:40.780
so still trying to track
down where that came from.

19:40.813 --> 19:41.981
That why you called?

19:42.014 --> 19:44.617
Nope.
Then what do you got?

19:44.651 --> 19:46.753
Evidence of a genocide.

19:46.786 --> 19:47.987
Animal or human?

19:48.020 --> 19:49.956
Insect.

19:51.658 --> 19:54.294
The southern pine beetle.

19:54.327 --> 19:55.795
DAWSON:
Tree killer.
Yep.

19:55.828 --> 19:58.998
That's why the Forest Service
sprays infested areas

19:59.031 --> 20:01.000
with a poison
called permethrin.

20:01.033 --> 20:04.371
Guess what else had traces
of permethrin on it.

20:06.573 --> 20:07.940
How?

20:07.974 --> 20:09.542
So glad you asked.

20:09.576 --> 20:14.547
So the only local area
that's recently been dusted

20:14.581 --> 20:17.650
is a remote stretch of land
outside of Alexandria.

20:17.684 --> 20:19.986
That's a national forest.
The bag was there?

20:20.019 --> 20:21.521
Mm-hmm. Two days ago,

20:21.554 --> 20:22.655
when it was sprayed.

20:22.689 --> 20:24.257
The only structure
in the spray zone

20:24.291 --> 20:27.594
is an old ranger shack.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.263
Thanks, Abbs.

20:36.669 --> 20:39.639
DAWSON:
Did you try carrots?

20:39.672 --> 20:41.274
What about his treats?

20:42.642 --> 20:45.278
Well, then I'm out of ideas,
but I'll visit tomorrow.

20:45.312 --> 20:47.414
Thanks.

20:47.447 --> 20:48.648
Sorry. Jody.

20:48.681 --> 20:49.749
Bullet wound?

20:49.782 --> 20:51.651
Just a graze, no tissue damage.

20:51.684 --> 20:54.554
The horse could gallop tomorrow,
but Jody won't eat.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.823
Well, he's used to the same
person, riding him, feeding him,

20:56.856 --> 20:58.291
putting him away.

20:58.325 --> 20:59.526
He knows something's wrong.

20:59.559 --> 21:01.461
So you know your horses.

21:01.494 --> 21:03.029
Got tire tracks.

21:04.531 --> 21:06.633
Looks like a dually.

21:06.666 --> 21:07.800
(camera clicks)

21:07.834 --> 21:09.702
Box truck, maybe.

21:11.003 --> 21:12.805
So you know
your trucks.

21:12.839 --> 21:14.674
I own trucks.

21:14.707 --> 21:16.509
Got them and the horses
in the divorce.

21:16.543 --> 21:17.577
He got everything else.

21:17.610 --> 21:18.811
What else is there?

21:18.845 --> 21:21.614
His 23-year-old
assistant.

21:21.648 --> 21:23.716
You got the better part
of that deal.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.385
Damn right, I don't
have to have dinner

21:25.418 --> 21:27.654
with the horses'
sorority sisters.

21:27.687 --> 21:29.622
That's a new lock.

21:29.656 --> 21:31.958
DAWSON:
About as secure as a screen door

21:31.991 --> 21:33.493
on a submarine.

21:33.526 --> 21:36.095
Whoa. Whatever's inside
might need to stay in there.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.564
(clears throat)

21:37.597 --> 21:39.098
Only one thing
smells like that.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.767
Dead body.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.902
I was hoping for something
different this time.

21:42.935 --> 21:44.637
Mind if I get this over with?

21:50.042 --> 21:52.044
(flies buzzing)

21:56.082 --> 21:58.050
Well, that's different.

22:05.925 --> 22:08.094
It's called bushmeat.

22:08.127 --> 22:11.063
Derived from animals
native to Africa.

22:11.097 --> 22:13.733
Bat, monkey, lion--

22:13.766 --> 22:17.470
whatever the local
population hunts for protein.

22:17.504 --> 22:18.771
In Liberia.

22:18.805 --> 22:20.973
Oh, in many countries
all over Africa.

22:21.007 --> 22:22.842
It's outlawed by
their governments

22:22.875 --> 22:25.478
because it destroys
the ecosystems.

22:25.512 --> 22:28.448
Duck, this case isn't about
rhino horns or elephant tusks.

22:28.481 --> 22:30.550
No, it's about food.

22:30.583 --> 22:32.452
So what's it doing
in the U.S.?

22:32.485 --> 22:35.888
Jethro, illegal bushmeat
is a worldwide,

22:35.922 --> 22:38.090
billion-dollar business.

22:38.124 --> 22:40.693
It's smoked,
smuggled into the country,

22:40.727 --> 22:43.763
and then sold on the street
to expatriate communities.

22:43.796 --> 22:45.097
Taste of home.

22:45.131 --> 22:49.101
Well, never underestimate
the power of nostalgia.

22:49.135 --> 22:51.771
Mere pounds can go for
hundreds of dollars.

22:51.804 --> 22:52.939
It's a health risk.

22:52.972 --> 22:54.907
Well, the greatest fear
is of an unknown

22:54.941 --> 22:56.743
and catastrophic disease.

22:56.776 --> 23:01.080
You see, smoking the meat does
not kill off all the bacteria.

23:01.113 --> 23:02.815
Sounds like nightmare soup.

23:02.849 --> 23:05.084
It's a shame.
I used to like soup.

23:05.117 --> 23:07.787
What do you have?
Uh, maybe a little good news.

23:07.820 --> 23:09.856
That's a welcome change.

23:09.889 --> 23:11.891
I know why our killer stole
our victim's cell phone:

23:11.924 --> 23:13.192
he was taking
pictures of them.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.595
But our dead Marine

23:15.628 --> 23:17.129
had a cloud account
that automatically uploads

23:17.163 --> 23:18.631
any cell phone pictures.

23:18.665 --> 23:20.767
No clear faces,
but they tell a story.

23:20.800 --> 23:23.736
The bushmeat must be
in those bags.

23:23.770 --> 23:25.137
Including the skulls.
Well, they're used

23:25.171 --> 23:27.073
to prove the meat's
origin and worth.

23:27.106 --> 23:28.240
BISHOP:
Either way,

23:28.274 --> 23:30.877
I think these guys were headed
to the park to sell it.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.645
Our Marine followed them.
Mm-hmm.

23:32.679 --> 23:34.113
He hid in the bushes,

23:34.146 --> 23:36.048
but they must have
seen him and attacked.

23:36.082 --> 23:37.650
When Dawson showed up,

23:37.684 --> 23:39.185
the killers ditched
the monkey skulls.

23:39.218 --> 23:40.286
They came back yesterday.

23:40.319 --> 23:42.889
Which is when they shot
Officer Cole and his horse.

23:42.922 --> 23:46.526
But it is looking like our dead
Marine was one of the good guys.

23:46.559 --> 23:48.094
An animal lover to the last.

23:50.096 --> 23:51.864
VANCE: This is what
you wouldn't say,

23:51.898 --> 23:54.200
what you thought this
case was leading to.

23:54.233 --> 23:56.202
My apologies,
Director Vance.

23:56.235 --> 23:59.839
It is both a source
of great pride

23:59.872 --> 24:01.440
and embarrassment.

24:02.975 --> 24:04.043
Have a seat.

24:06.879 --> 24:10.917
We... are a nation
of survivors.

24:10.950 --> 24:13.252
Slavery, civil wars.

24:13.285 --> 24:16.689
We strive for progress,
but many are still poor,

24:16.723 --> 24:20.259
and cattle production
is difficult and costly.

24:20.292 --> 24:23.596
Bushmeat has been a way of life
for generations.

24:23.630 --> 24:26.866
Which is why it can wipe
out animal populations.

24:26.899 --> 24:29.068
It is unsustainable
and a health risk.

24:29.101 --> 24:31.904
My government desperately tries
to teach this to the public.

24:31.938 --> 24:35.107
But food is also
a cultural touchstone.

24:35.141 --> 24:38.978
Used for celebrations,
weddings, christenings.

24:39.011 --> 24:40.880
More reasons it's smuggled
into our country.

24:42.815 --> 24:43.850
Old habits die hard.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.520
Sorry, that's another
turn of phrase.

24:47.554 --> 24:51.190
It's difficult
to change minds.

24:51.223 --> 24:53.159
Even more so to change hearts.

24:53.192 --> 24:54.727
Ah.

24:54.761 --> 24:56.028
Many Liberian citizens

24:56.062 --> 24:59.265
believe the government
to be weak or corrupt.

24:59.298 --> 25:01.300
Sometimes it is true.

25:01.333 --> 25:04.103
But I am here

25:04.136 --> 25:07.039
to offer any assistance
you may require.

25:09.008 --> 25:10.009
Anything, please.

25:10.042 --> 25:13.012
I appreciate that.

25:13.045 --> 25:14.881
And I just might have
something in mind.

25:17.950 --> 25:18.785
Undercover?

25:18.818 --> 25:20.820
Ambassador Moore
has agreed to lead you

25:20.853 --> 25:22.021
through a local street market

25:22.054 --> 25:23.890
where he believes
bushmeat is being sold.

25:23.923 --> 25:25.758
Market vendors can lead
us to the smugglers.

25:25.792 --> 25:27.026
Yeah, and the killers,
I get it.

25:27.059 --> 25:28.595
Why did he ask for me?

25:28.628 --> 25:30.262
Said he liked you.
He liked me?

25:30.296 --> 25:31.931
The man said two things to me:

25:31.964 --> 25:33.299
"Hello," and then
"Get out of the room."

25:33.332 --> 25:35.134
I'm pretty sure he thought
I was the butler.

25:35.167 --> 25:36.603
So did I at first.

25:37.670 --> 25:39.205
Reeves, Jeeves.

25:39.238 --> 25:40.640
So confusing.

25:40.673 --> 25:42.742
That's funny.

25:42.775 --> 25:45.044
I can also think of something
that rhymes with "Nick."

25:45.077 --> 25:46.879
Slick?
Try again.

25:48.981 --> 25:50.683
Quinn, everything okay?

25:50.717 --> 25:52.885
Uh, no, just got off
the phone with the hospital.

25:52.919 --> 25:56.055
It seems that Officer Cole's
internal bleeding didn't stop,

25:56.088 --> 25:57.824
so he died an hour ago.

25:57.857 --> 26:00.559
Looks like we've got
two murders on our hands.

26:01.928 --> 26:03.329
Boss, did you hear about this?

26:03.362 --> 26:05.297
Find the source of that meat.

26:05.331 --> 26:07.900
(elevator bell dings)

26:09.902 --> 26:12.138
(elevator bell dings)

26:12.171 --> 26:14.140
(upbeat African music playing,
food sizzling)

26:14.173 --> 26:17.043
(lively crowd chatter)

26:26.719 --> 26:28.320
(bleating)

26:31.891 --> 26:34.093
WOMAN:
Gentlemen, come, come.

26:34.126 --> 26:35.695
You need spices?

26:35.728 --> 26:36.996
I have spices.

26:38.765 --> 26:40.633
Tsire has a lovely flavor.

26:40.667 --> 26:43.069
Peanuts and spices,
perfect for meat.

26:43.102 --> 26:44.103
MOORE:
That is the problem.

26:44.136 --> 26:45.371
We have no meat.

26:45.404 --> 26:46.906
Perhaps you
can help us?

26:46.939 --> 26:48.240
This is a market.

26:48.274 --> 26:49.909
There is plenty
of meat.

26:49.942 --> 26:51.043
You pick something.

26:51.077 --> 26:52.378
I have spices
to make it delicious.

26:52.411 --> 26:53.813
MOORE:
Uh, no, no, no, no.

26:53.846 --> 26:56.649
I want to cook my friend
a piece of home.

26:56.683 --> 26:58.818
Mm-hmm.
I need bushmeat.

27:01.988 --> 27:04.056
What is the word you said?

27:04.090 --> 27:05.825
Bushmeat, please.

27:08.094 --> 27:10.096
This is America.

27:10.129 --> 27:12.064
I am an American.

27:12.098 --> 27:14.133
I don't know about that.

27:14.166 --> 27:15.401
Now, go.

27:15.434 --> 27:16.869
Go!

27:19.271 --> 27:20.807
(sighs)

27:20.840 --> 27:22.441
No one's willing
to talk to us.

27:22.474 --> 27:25.144
Patience. The
word will spread.

27:25.177 --> 27:27.747
Someone always wants
to make money, huh?

27:27.780 --> 27:29.916
Is it odd this is
making me hungry?

27:29.949 --> 27:31.283
Everyone gets hungry.

27:31.317 --> 27:32.752
Even butlers.

27:39.191 --> 27:40.459
MAN:
Fresh veggies, gentlemen!

27:40.492 --> 27:41.994
Come try some.

27:42.028 --> 27:43.362
No, thanks.

27:43.395 --> 27:45.164
One taste can change your mind.

27:45.197 --> 27:46.766
You did say you were hungry.

27:48.134 --> 27:50.236
Wait, I know you.
MOORE: I...

27:50.269 --> 27:52.204
I don't think so.
Yes, yes, yes,

27:52.238 --> 27:54.040
You are a government man.

27:54.073 --> 27:56.008
Please, keep your
voice down, huh?
Oh, I will.

27:56.042 --> 27:58.177
If the rich government man
donates to the knife show.

27:58.210 --> 27:59.912
Knife show?

27:59.946 --> 28:01.781
You've got a long way
before you turn pro.

28:02.815 --> 28:04.350
I am flawless.
Hardly.

28:04.383 --> 28:08.054
Look at your ear.
Practice makes perfect.

28:08.087 --> 28:09.956
Yeah, clearly you need
lots of it.
Hey, Clayton,

28:09.989 --> 28:11.490
pay the man and let it be, huh?

28:11.523 --> 28:12.825
We do not want trouble.

28:13.926 --> 28:16.195
WOMAN:
Let go of me!

28:16.228 --> 28:18.230
She did not pay
for that! I saw you!

28:18.264 --> 28:19.932
Who do you think
you are?

28:19.966 --> 28:22.201
You cannot come to our market
and just think you can take...

28:22.234 --> 28:23.269
All right, all right,
break it up!

28:23.302 --> 28:24.070
That's enough!

28:24.103 --> 28:26.038
Break it up!
Hey, that's enough!

28:26.072 --> 28:28.775
Or I start spraying!
Get off her!

28:28.808 --> 28:31.277
I've recently seen
how nasty this stuff is.

28:31.310 --> 28:33.179
I really don't want to use it.

28:33.212 --> 28:34.814
Okay? So stop.
Please.

28:37.116 --> 28:39.185
Who the hell are you?
She was stealing from us!

28:39.218 --> 28:40.086
I can explain.

28:43.122 --> 28:46.025
DAWSON: Thanks for
returning Cole's boots.

28:46.058 --> 28:48.961
The familiar scent and visual
can help them understand.

28:48.995 --> 28:52.198
Help them...
grieve and move on.

28:56.235 --> 28:58.170
Worth a shot.

28:58.204 --> 29:00.139
I agree.

29:00.172 --> 29:02.508
Question is: how did you
know to bring the boots?

29:02.541 --> 29:04.176
(chuckles)

29:08.247 --> 29:10.382
I know that you'd
want Cole's badge.

29:12.184 --> 29:14.053
We're finished
with processing.

29:14.086 --> 29:16.222
Thank you.
(softly): Yeah.

29:18.891 --> 29:21.260
Really thought
that he'd pull through.

29:21.293 --> 29:24.163
You two were close.

29:24.196 --> 29:27.066
Yeah, I trained him.

29:27.099 --> 29:29.468
And right now I'm wondering
if I did a good enough job.

29:29.501 --> 29:32.171
This place,
these people,

29:32.204 --> 29:33.572
they're family.

29:33.605 --> 29:35.174
I think you did
everything right.

29:35.207 --> 29:38.110
Jody still won't eat.

29:38.144 --> 29:40.980
Sounds funny, but you know,
they get depressed.

29:43.415 --> 29:46.052
Yeah, I've seen that before.

29:49.221 --> 29:53.860
My daughter, Kelly, she used
to ride down by the beach.

29:53.893 --> 29:55.494
There was this stable
near the water,

29:55.527 --> 29:58.264
owned by an old Korean War vet.

29:58.297 --> 30:00.399
He started calling her
Sergeant Reckless.

30:00.432 --> 30:02.368
After the war horse, why?

30:02.401 --> 30:05.371
One summer, his wife died,

30:05.404 --> 30:08.374
and her horse wouldn't ride,
wouldn't eat.

30:08.407 --> 30:12.611
Kelly noticed that,
and she made it her project.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.480
Horse ignored her.

30:16.248 --> 30:18.284
But she kept going back.

30:18.317 --> 30:19.919
Every day.

30:19.952 --> 30:21.553
Until the horse started eating.

30:21.587 --> 30:23.155
Mm-hmm.

30:23.189 --> 30:26.926
She knew that that horse
just needed a buddy.

30:26.959 --> 30:29.628
Sergeant Reckless,
because like the war horse,

30:29.661 --> 30:31.630
your daughter was a lifesaver.

30:31.663 --> 30:33.199
(chuckles)

30:33.232 --> 30:36.268
So horse sense
runs in the family.

30:36.302 --> 30:38.871
No. Uh, that was all her.

30:38.905 --> 30:42.208
I saw the way that you
were with Jody yesterday.

30:42.241 --> 30:45.211
You're just what he
needs to break his funk.

30:45.244 --> 30:47.313
Funk?
Everybody here has
already tried everything;

30:47.346 --> 30:49.215
this horse is as
stubborn as they come,

30:49.248 --> 30:51.984
and I think he's finally met
his match, Gibbs.

30:52.018 --> 30:54.586
At least, I hope so,
anyways, if you're willing.

30:56.655 --> 31:00.059
A horse that doesn't eat, dies.

31:06.265 --> 31:08.234
I was only trying to help.

31:08.267 --> 31:09.235
Okay, last time
I was here,

31:09.268 --> 31:10.536
NCIS thought
my friend was guilty,

31:10.569 --> 31:12.338
so I wanted to clear his name.

31:12.371 --> 31:15.341
I was there,
asking questions about bushmeat.

31:15.374 --> 31:18.310
No one would answer me,
so I started poking around.

31:18.344 --> 31:19.645
They thought you were stealing.

31:19.678 --> 31:21.380
Because they're hiding
something.

31:23.315 --> 31:27.486
I didn't find anything
to prove that, but I can tell.

31:27.519 --> 31:29.956
Wait a minute.

31:29.989 --> 31:32.891
Who told you the murder
had to do with bushmeat?

31:39.298 --> 31:40.933
Abby.

31:40.967 --> 31:42.234
Okay. What else do we have?

31:42.268 --> 31:44.136
Nothing. We've
hit a dead end.

31:44.170 --> 31:46.338
No leads on the bushmeat
or the smuggling pipeline.

31:46.372 --> 31:48.340
(door opens, closes)

31:48.374 --> 31:49.441
Okay, first thing.

31:49.475 --> 31:52.044
I only talked to Phoebe
because she knew the victim.

31:52.078 --> 31:54.346
I didn't know
she was gonna go commando.
What's the second thing?

31:54.380 --> 31:56.115
Okay, the second thing
should be the first thing.

31:56.148 --> 31:57.349
I used the wildlife
DNA database

31:57.383 --> 31:59.518
to track all the animals
from the meat shack.

31:59.551 --> 32:02.955
They all came from
the Gbarma District of Liberia.

32:02.989 --> 32:04.690
Is that good or bad?

32:04.723 --> 32:05.691
It's a bad thing.

32:06.558 --> 32:08.260
A small village
in Gbarma

32:08.294 --> 32:11.297
just reported an Ebola outbreak.

32:11.330 --> 32:12.664
All the meat

32:12.698 --> 32:14.400
downstairs was clear.

32:14.433 --> 32:15.367
Next shipment won't be.

32:15.401 --> 32:18.404
No. We have to cut off
this pipeline, now.

32:28.747 --> 32:34.086
Okay, CDC, FDA and the FAA
have all been notified.

32:34.120 --> 32:36.188
FAA?
According to
the USDA,

32:36.222 --> 32:38.724
bushmeat gets into the country
via airports.

32:38.757 --> 32:41.260
How many different agencies
are involved with this stuff?

32:41.293 --> 32:42.361
Well, I left out FWS,

32:42.394 --> 32:44.430
who said the meat can be hidden

32:44.463 --> 32:47.433
in shipments of fish
or other legal foods.

32:47.466 --> 32:51.603
But mostly,
it's just smuggled in suitcases.

32:51.637 --> 32:53.605
Well, you won't find that
in the food court.

32:53.639 --> 32:56.375
Point is, a shipment
tainted with Ebola

32:56.408 --> 32:57.743
has its way of
getting here.

32:57.776 --> 32:59.445
We're gonna stop them.

32:59.478 --> 33:00.346
McGEE: Yeah, we're
trying, boss.

33:00.379 --> 33:02.381
We've been through
all the Liberian intel.

33:02.414 --> 33:03.549
Government surveillance
on poachers

33:03.582 --> 33:05.417
and known players
in the animal trade.

33:05.451 --> 33:07.453
McGEE:
A lot of suspects.

33:07.486 --> 33:09.388
BISHOP:
But none in the U.S.

33:09.421 --> 33:10.622
Dead end.

33:10.656 --> 33:12.558
Whoa, wait. Stop. Go back.

33:12.591 --> 33:14.160
Right there.
Who's that?

33:14.193 --> 33:15.294
BISHOP:
Ousmane Best.

33:15.327 --> 33:18.297
He's a big-time poacher,
but he's in prison in Liberia.

33:18.330 --> 33:19.465
Who's that with him?

33:19.498 --> 33:21.600
The dreadlock guy?
Uh, I can't tell.

33:21.633 --> 33:23.402
You know what?
Our Marine has more photos

33:23.435 --> 33:25.437
from that same batch
on his laptop.

33:28.507 --> 33:30.342
Boss, is that...?

33:30.376 --> 33:33.312
ABBY:
Nelson, our park stoner.

33:33.345 --> 33:36.515
He said he quit trafficking
illegal drugs, which was true.

33:36.548 --> 33:38.250
Yeah, well,
he got into bushmeat.

33:38.284 --> 33:41.320
Different product,
same illegal pipeline.

33:41.353 --> 33:43.255
Airport connections.
Guy was broke.

33:43.289 --> 33:44.456
If he's a kingpin,
where's the money?

33:44.490 --> 33:45.824
He was never
a kingpin.

33:45.857 --> 33:49.061
He was an avenue to
get to U.S. soil.

33:49.095 --> 33:51.197
He's getting the meat
from someplace overseas,

33:51.230 --> 33:53.399
so I'm betting that
that's where the money is, too.

33:53.432 --> 33:56.402
It's an offshore account.
Yeah. Still raises
a lot of questions.

33:56.435 --> 33:57.836
TORRES:
And I got answers.

33:57.869 --> 33:59.505
And maracas.
(maracas shaking)

33:59.538 --> 34:01.507
Ah! They had them
at the pawn shop.

34:01.540 --> 34:02.841
TORRES:
Oh, you owe me $10.

34:02.874 --> 34:04.343
Oh, Abby will explain.

34:04.376 --> 34:06.578
Oh, I gave, uh, my maracas
to a friend of mine.

34:06.612 --> 34:09.348
No, uh, explain
the other thing.

34:09.381 --> 34:13.419
Right. So, I finally tracked
down the parking stub

34:13.452 --> 34:14.753
from the Marine's car

34:14.786 --> 34:16.555
to a parking garage

34:16.588 --> 34:18.590
by a pawn shop downtown.

34:18.624 --> 34:20.359
Here.

34:20.392 --> 34:21.493
I checked it out.

34:21.527 --> 34:24.363
Tanner pawned a guitar
the night he died.

34:24.396 --> 34:25.464
Deposit for
a new apartment.

34:25.497 --> 34:27.099
Explains the cash in his wallet.

34:27.133 --> 34:28.534
TORRES: Also explains
how he found Nelson.

34:28.567 --> 34:30.469
Got security footage
from the parking garage.

34:30.502 --> 34:32.704
Can you fast forward
to 9:47 p.m., please?

34:33.805 --> 34:35.341
Yep.

34:35.374 --> 34:37.776
And there's our stoner.

34:37.809 --> 34:41.147
And Gunnery Sergeant Tanner
walked right by him.

34:41.180 --> 34:43.315
Yeah, he bumped into him
in the parking lot.

34:43.349 --> 34:44.550
Purely by chance.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.452
GIBBS:
He recognized him.

34:46.485 --> 34:48.454
ABBY: Probably from the
same photo you did, Gibbs.

34:48.487 --> 34:50.322
Also, Tanner's been studying
those poacher files

34:50.356 --> 34:51.790
for at least three months.

34:51.823 --> 34:54.393
ABBY: He must have followed
Nelson all the way to the park.

34:54.426 --> 34:56.428
Where is he now?
No permanent address.

34:56.462 --> 34:58.464
He does live
in a mobile tiny house.

34:58.497 --> 35:00.166
What about his accomplice?

35:00.199 --> 35:02.534
The guy who shot Officer
Cole and the horse

35:02.568 --> 35:04.170
does not show up
on the video.

35:04.203 --> 35:05.504
But I might have a lead,

35:05.537 --> 35:08.174
and straight from
the horse's mouth.

35:09.375 --> 35:11.210
Someone had to say it.

35:12.744 --> 35:14.346
MCGEE: So how much jewelry
did you have to go through

35:14.380 --> 35:15.147
before you found a match?

35:15.181 --> 35:18.384
A lot. Ivory's still
way too popular.

35:18.417 --> 35:22.588
Uh, the piece from Jody's mouth
was from a spiral taper earring.

35:22.621 --> 35:24.156
Thought horses were vegetarians.

35:24.190 --> 35:26.292
Well, they are,
but this one was smart enough

35:26.325 --> 35:27.393
to take a bite
out of the shooter.

35:27.426 --> 35:29.895
REEVES: Yeah. His bloody ear
wasn't from his knife act.

35:29.928 --> 35:31.630
Oh, he's on
the move. Look.

35:36.635 --> 35:38.470
GIBBS:
Heads up, gang. We got a truck.

35:38.504 --> 35:39.605
(horn honks)

35:43.542 --> 35:45.277
McGee, you three
have the street.

35:45.311 --> 35:46.612
It's a busy place.

35:46.645 --> 35:48.280
Not ideal for a takedown.

35:50.216 --> 35:51.483
Wait on my signal.

35:53.752 --> 35:54.586
Hurry up.

35:54.620 --> 35:56.488
Come on, I called
you two hours ago.

35:56.522 --> 35:57.923
Between the park yesterday
and the market today,

35:57.956 --> 35:59.625
police are too close.

35:59.658 --> 36:02.194
Then forget your stuff so we
can get the hell out of here.

36:02.228 --> 36:04.463
If we can get
out of the country,

36:04.496 --> 36:05.964
my uncle will hide us
in Monrovia.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.633
I don't need your uncle.
Let's go.

36:07.666 --> 36:09.801
GIBBS:
Bishop, Torres, move.

36:17.643 --> 36:18.477
Federal agents!

36:18.510 --> 36:20.512
The police, they're here!

36:20.546 --> 36:22.548
Then you better
get out of the way.

36:22.581 --> 36:23.549
McGEE:
Gun!

36:27.886 --> 36:28.687
NCIS!

36:28.720 --> 36:31.523
(coughing)

36:31.557 --> 36:32.591
It's over!
Put your hands in the air!

36:32.624 --> 36:33.692
(coughing)

36:33.725 --> 36:35.294
Don't shoot!

36:43.735 --> 36:46.004
(handcuffs clicking)

36:46.037 --> 36:50.008
This is exactly how they train
rangers to take down poachers.

36:50.041 --> 36:51.877
NEWSCASTER: Two arrests
have been made in connection

36:51.910 --> 36:54.946
with the smuggling of illegal
bushmeat into the United States.

36:54.980 --> 36:56.715
Meat tainted with
the Ebola virus...

36:56.748 --> 36:57.949
Congratulations, Director.

36:57.983 --> 37:00.752
Two smugglers gave up their
airport contacts pretty fast.

37:00.786 --> 37:03.455
Be assured, my government
is following up in Liberia.

37:03.489 --> 37:04.890
This will not end here.

37:04.923 --> 37:06.258
Ball's in your court now.

37:06.292 --> 37:07.759
That idiom I know.

37:07.793 --> 37:09.595
(laughs)

37:09.628 --> 37:11.663
Press conference is in an hour.

37:13.365 --> 37:15.767
Director.

37:17.569 --> 37:20.038
Please be mindful in your media
portrayal of my government.

37:20.071 --> 37:23.675
It is a powerful tool
that could help build trust.

37:23.709 --> 37:26.645
This press conference
will be seen back home.

37:26.678 --> 37:29.848
Which is why you're giving
the opening statement.

37:29.881 --> 37:31.417
I beg your pardon?

37:31.450 --> 37:34.553
I can't think of anything
more powerful

37:34.586 --> 37:38.690
than your country seeing a proud
and committed public servant.

37:38.724 --> 37:40.492
(laughs)

37:40.526 --> 37:41.727
Thank you.

37:44.463 --> 37:47.866
Now, that's just, um...
that's just beautiful.

37:47.899 --> 37:50.369
Park police said he
was born this morning

37:50.402 --> 37:51.837
and that they named him

37:51.870 --> 37:53.339
after fallen officer Cole.

37:53.372 --> 37:55.607
Mm. Cole the foal.

37:55.641 --> 37:57.676
(chuckles) Just...

37:57.709 --> 38:00.579
Who's crying over a horse now?

38:00.612 --> 38:02.514
Oh, come on.
It's pepper spray, come on.

38:02.548 --> 38:03.749
Nick, that was
three hours ago.

38:03.782 --> 38:04.883
(laughs)

38:04.916 --> 38:05.984
McGEE:
Nick.

38:06.017 --> 38:07.686
Got great news.
What's up, Tim?

38:07.719 --> 38:09.688
Um...

38:11.056 --> 38:12.758
You know what, never mind.

38:12.791 --> 38:13.925
Come on, tell me.
What's up?

38:13.959 --> 38:16.728
Okay, um...
(chuckles)

38:16.762 --> 38:19.365
It's a, it's kind of
a funny story, really.

38:19.398 --> 38:20.832
The, uh, the OCAT training.

38:20.866 --> 38:22.934
I just came from HR.

38:22.968 --> 38:24.736
Turns out they, uh,
they mixed up the dates.

38:24.770 --> 38:26.438
We're not due until next year.

38:26.472 --> 38:27.773
We didn't have to get sprayed?

38:27.806 --> 38:29.341
Oops.

38:29.375 --> 38:30.976
"Oops"?

38:31.009 --> 38:32.911
Okay, Reeves, hand it over.

38:32.944 --> 38:35.981
I'm sorry, Tim,
but I am an independent party.

38:36.014 --> 38:37.549
What? What are you doing?

38:38.717 --> 38:39.785
No. Oh, come on. That's funny.

38:39.818 --> 38:41.687
Very funny, very funny.

38:41.720 --> 38:43.789
Any last words before
we take this outside?

38:44.790 --> 38:45.757
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
come on.

38:45.791 --> 38:47.526
This-this is
not my fault.

38:49.528 --> 38:50.496
(rooster crowing)

38:50.529 --> 38:51.930
DAWSON:
Hey, buddy.

38:51.963 --> 38:53.799
Yeah.

38:55.834 --> 38:57.503
Well, what do you know?

38:57.536 --> 39:00.706
Good to have you back, pal.

39:00.739 --> 39:02.708
What changed, huh?

39:09.815 --> 39:12.551
Gibbs, you've been here
all night?

39:14.686 --> 39:16.154
What did you do?

39:16.187 --> 39:17.989
What?
He's eating.

39:18.023 --> 39:18.990
Tell me what you did.

39:25.864 --> 39:27.833
I could get you
a coffee or an aspirin.

39:27.866 --> 39:31.570
That's a mighty hard floor.

39:31.603 --> 39:33.772
No.

39:33.805 --> 39:35.741
We don't mind.

39:35.774 --> 39:37.676
Do we, Jody?

39:37.709 --> 39:39.411
(chuckles)

39:39.445 --> 39:42.681
He just needed a buddy.

39:42.714 --> 39:46.985
Well, you know, Jody could also
use a ride, if you're up for it.

39:47.018 --> 39:49.054
What do you think?

39:49.087 --> 39:51.690
(laughs)
Okay.
