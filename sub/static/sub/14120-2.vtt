(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:33.166 --> 00:34.433
Ugh.

00:35.001 --> 00:36.535
Hmm.

00:36.537 --> 00:39.538
Why do you have photos
of naked women in
our living room?

00:39.540 --> 00:41.507
Not all of them are naked.

00:41.509 --> 00:44.643
Some didn't follow
instructions and sent me
pictures in their underwear.

00:44.645 --> 00:46.545
Ha.

00:46.547 --> 00:49.748
It's kind of hard to cast you
in the lead role of the
Untitled Vagina Project

00:49.750 --> 00:52.217
if I can't even
see your vagina.

00:52.219 --> 00:53.685
You're making a movie?

00:53.687 --> 00:56.055
-Who's making a movie?
-No one's making a movie!

00:56.057 --> 00:59.291
It's a scam to get women
to send me beaver shots.

00:59.293 --> 01:00.826
Let me see that... Oh!

01:00.828 --> 01:03.028
She followed the instructions

01:03.030 --> 01:05.197
to the letter.

01:05.199 --> 01:06.498
MIKE: Hey gang, get in here.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.600
-We got a new mystery.
-Oh, what is it?

01:08.602 --> 01:09.902
"Call Deezy."

01:09.904 --> 01:12.504
What the hell kind of
mystery is that?

01:12.506 --> 01:14.640
Michael, that's
a phone message.

01:15.341 --> 01:17.076
Ugh, Deezy.

01:17.078 --> 01:19.545
I can't believe you let
that guy be your agent.
He's a parasite.

01:19.547 --> 01:20.979
You're a parasite.

01:20.981 --> 01:22.881
Now, Yung,

01:22.883 --> 01:25.617
that is no way to talk
to a casting director who's
about to offer you the role

01:25.619 --> 01:26.852
of the best friend

01:26.854 --> 01:29.688
in the Untitled
Vagina Project.

01:29.690 --> 01:31.824
You don't have to submit
a photo of your vagina.

01:31.826 --> 01:33.358
-YUNG: Why?
-I don't want to see it.

01:33.360 --> 01:35.227
Deezy? What's up fool?

01:35.229 --> 01:36.495
Hey Mike, what's up?

01:36.497 --> 01:38.263
Listen, I got you something.

01:38.265 --> 01:40.132
<i>-What you got?</i>
-You got any mysteries going
on this week?

01:40.134 --> 01:41.900
No, Deezy, we're just chillin.

01:41.902 --> 01:44.369
I think Pigeon is working
on a movie or something.

01:44.371 --> 01:46.305
I heard him saying
something about a movie.

01:46.307 --> 01:49.007
I'm gonna put him on the phone
with you, and he'll tell you.

01:49.009 --> 01:50.976
Hey, it's Deezy, tell
him about the movie.

01:50.978 --> 01:54.113
Oh, hello, Deezy.
Hey, how's the shithead
business going?

01:54.115 --> 01:55.447
<i>Suck my</i> (BLEEP), <i> Pigeon.</i>

01:55.449 --> 01:56.949
Now tell me about this
movie of yours.

01:56.951 --> 01:59.184
You got any part
in it for Mike?

01:59.186 --> 02:02.187
Oh, no, unfortunately there
will be no part in it for
Mike, Deezy, because

02:02.189 --> 02:03.856
there's no movie.

02:03.858 --> 02:05.657
Oh, you think Mike can't
act in a movie? He's
been in big movies.

02:05.659 --> 02:06.992
You ever heard of
<i>The Hangover?</i>

02:06.994 --> 02:08.994
No, I've never heard of
<i>The Hangover.</i>

02:08.996 --> 02:10.028
(BLEEP) Pigeon.

02:10.030 --> 02:11.330
You better put Mike
in your movie.

02:11.332 --> 02:13.499
He lets you live in his house.

02:13.501 --> 02:16.902
Yeah. Okay, well, I gotta go
Deezy because I don't want
to talk to you anymore.

02:18.605 --> 02:20.639
So, what's up, Deezy,
what you got for me?

02:20.641 --> 02:23.041
I got you a gig.
A very special gig.

02:23.043 --> 02:26.812
Part of a celebrity tour.
Entertain the troops
in Afghanistan.

02:26.814 --> 02:29.148
Hey, I thought we pulled
out of Afghanistan.

02:29.150 --> 02:31.316
DEEZY: <i> No, Mike, we still got</i>
<i>a lot of personnel there.</i>

02:31.318 --> 02:33.752
<i>We got special forces, we got</i>
<i>counter-terrorism forces,</i>

02:33.754 --> 02:37.289
<i>military training personnel.</i>
<i>Come on, Mike, we've had</i>
<i>this conversation before.</i>

02:37.291 --> 02:41.193
Hey, you know what, I'm
right outside your house.
I'm just gonna come in.

02:42.295 --> 02:44.930
Hey! Mike, Yung, Ghost.

02:44.932 --> 02:46.031
How ya'll doing?

02:46.033 --> 02:47.933
-(BLEEP) you, Pigeon.
-(PIGEON SCOFFS)

02:47.935 --> 02:50.102
Hey, Deezy man, would you mind
taking off your shoes, man?

02:50.104 --> 02:52.104
We've become a no-shoe
household here.

02:52.106 --> 02:54.540
Oh, not a problem, Mike.
You get the carpets cleaned?

02:54.542 --> 02:58.143
No, I read about all these
things people track into your
house, man, with their shoes.

02:58.145 --> 03:02.080
Dirt, urine, vomit,
semen, and pollen.

03:02.082 --> 03:04.483
Man, I've been
sneezing all day!

03:04.485 --> 03:06.051
Oh, I feel you, Mike.

03:06.053 --> 03:08.487
Can I get you anything?
You know, something to drink.

03:08.489 --> 03:09.821
Yeah, you got any
champagne open?

03:09.823 --> 03:11.657
-No...
-All right then, I'm good.

03:11.659 --> 03:14.326
-Okay, Deezy, let's talk more
about Afghanistan.
-PIGEON: More?

03:14.328 --> 03:17.162
It's a three-day trip.
You fly commercial to
Hamburg, Germany,

03:17.164 --> 03:19.231
and then they put you on
a C-17, straight to Kabul.

03:19.233 --> 03:21.800
Wait, you're going to
Afghanistan? When?

03:21.802 --> 03:22.968
-Right now.
-What?

03:22.970 --> 03:24.369
They need to fill the slot.

03:24.371 --> 03:25.904
Wayne Brady just dropped out.

03:25.906 --> 03:30.008
Hold up, man, I'm the
backup choice to Wayne Brady?

03:30.010 --> 03:32.477
That's a huge
(BLEEP) honor, man.

03:32.479 --> 03:36.448
I love Wayne Brady, man.
Man, what's that show, man?

03:36.450 --> 03:37.749
<i>Who The</i> (BLEEP) <i> Line Is It?</i>

03:37.751 --> 03:40.252
-Okay, Deezy, we will do it.
-What?

03:40.254 --> 03:42.888
Whoa, whoa, no Mike. This
invitation is just for you.

03:42.890 --> 03:45.257
No way, I can't do
improv by myself.

03:45.259 --> 03:47.659
Not even Wayne Brady
does it by himself.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.628
No one wants you
to do improv, Mike.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.964
Just do some of that getting
back up after you get
knocked down stuff.

03:51.966 --> 03:54.366
You know, boxer talk.
Inspirational.

03:54.368 --> 03:55.701
-Let's get this money.
-No.

03:55.703 --> 03:57.302
You can't disappoint
the troops.

03:57.304 --> 04:00.639
They are expecting improv,
and they're getting improv.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.541
But we don't know
how to do improv.

04:02.543 --> 04:03.909
That's the beauty of improv.

04:03.911 --> 04:06.011
You don't even have to know
how to do improv.

04:06.013 --> 04:08.180
You just have to improv
with something off the
top of your head.

04:08.182 --> 04:11.650
My God, how many
times are you assholes
gonna say "improv"?

04:19.158 --> 04:23.128
Excuse me, do you
have any of those little
bags of pretzels?

04:24.397 --> 04:26.331
Hmm. Bitch.

04:26.333 --> 04:28.900
That was sure nice of
Deezy to house-sit for us
while we were gone.

04:28.902 --> 04:31.136
He's probably going
to rob you.

04:31.138 --> 04:32.904
(CHUCKLES)

04:32.906 --> 04:35.540
You know what we gotta do
when we get there?
Get him a thank you gift.

04:35.542 --> 04:37.409
Yeah, soon as we get there.

04:37.411 --> 04:40.212
-What kind of (BLEEP) do they
sell in Afghanistan?
-I don't know.

04:40.214 --> 04:42.014
I think I've heard of
an Afghan rug.

04:42.016 --> 04:45.651
What the (BLEEP) does Deezy
need with an Afghan rug?

04:45.653 --> 04:47.219
No, he likes gadgets.

04:47.221 --> 04:51.023
You know, electric shit, man,
for his phone and stuff.

04:51.025 --> 04:56.995
Cheerleaders, huh?
That sounds like some good ole
fashioned troop entertainment.

04:56.997 --> 05:00.098
Let me ask you gals something,
you ever do any acting?

05:00.100 --> 05:04.436
I only ask because I happen
to be casting a film.

05:04.438 --> 05:06.038
-Ugh.
-What?

05:08.107 --> 05:10.108
Hey, Mike, I know
you're still in transit,

05:10.110 --> 05:12.577
but I want you to know
the house looks real good.

05:12.579 --> 05:16.248
I just finished feeding your
pigeons, I watered your plants
and brought your mail inside.

05:16.250 --> 05:18.684
Oh, wait, hold up.
It looks like you got
a new mystery, Mike.

05:18.686 --> 05:22.654
Don't you worry about it
though. Get that money
over there. I'm on this.

05:22.656 --> 05:28.327
Hey there, little fella.
What you got for me?
"Museum of Antiquity."

05:28.329 --> 05:31.430

United States Armed Forces,
welcome to Afghanistan,

Sergeant Gutierrez will drive
you to the performance venue.

05:36.203 --> 05:38.603
I'm sure we'll pass a
Best Buy on the way.

05:38.605 --> 05:40.806
If not, Deezy also
likes sunglasses.

05:40.808 --> 05:42.941
So be on the lookout
for a Sunglass Hut.

-Um, hello.
-Hello, little boy.

05:53.786 --> 05:56.355
Wait. You brought the van?

05:56.357 --> 05:59.324
Oh, yeah. Always bring
your own ride, man.

05:59.326 --> 06:04.029
I've been stuck at too
many lame ass parties, not
to have my own ride.

06:27.186 --> 06:29.020
My bad. That ain't
a Radio Shack.

this straight.

And now the mummy's gone.
