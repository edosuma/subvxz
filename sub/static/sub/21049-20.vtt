WEBVTT

00:11.428 --> 00:12.595
What are you doin'?

00:12.679 --> 00:14.097
It's called work.

00:14.181 --> 00:15.682
You oughta try it sometime.

00:17.850 --> 00:20.687
You oughta be taking it easy.
I'll do this.

00:21.563 --> 00:22.855
Or I won't.

00:23.606 --> 00:25.817
And then [grunts]
you can yell at me

00:25.900 --> 00:28.695
about not doin' it when you come home
from the hospital.

00:28.778 --> 00:31.198
Give you something to look forward to.
[chuckles softly]

00:32.365 --> 00:36.369
You know, my father taught me
to never leave a job unfinished.

00:37.454 --> 00:40.873
'Course, he also taught me
to never leave a steak unfinished.

00:40.957 --> 00:43.085
Probably why I had a fuckin' heart attack.

00:43.960 --> 00:45.087
Yeah?

00:45.170 --> 00:48.090
My dad taught me
the value of a good head of hair.

00:50.133 --> 00:54.429
You realize if I died right now,
that'd be the last thing you said to me?

00:56.389 --> 00:57.515
I think I'm good with that. [chuckles]

00:59.309 --> 01:00.810
Come on, you're gonna be fine.

01:02.395 --> 01:03.896
Hell. [sighs]

01:03.980 --> 01:05.398
[breathes deeply]

01:05.482 --> 01:08.610
You know, I've been on this ranch
for 72 years.

01:09.902 --> 01:13.740
Just the smell of the morning air
still gets me excited for the day.

01:13.823 --> 01:15.325
That's your excited face?

01:17.077 --> 01:20.705
Wow.
I had a happier childhood than I thought.

01:20.788 --> 01:21.789
[chuckling]

01:22.915 --> 01:26.336
Hey, uh,
I know it's not great timing, but, uh,

01:26.419 --> 01:28.213
the deadline on that Peterson place
is tomorrow,

01:28.296 --> 01:30.923
so, uh, I need you to sign the paperwork
before you leave today.

01:31.007 --> 01:33.885
I haven't even had a chance
to check out that place.

01:33.968 --> 01:37.847
Well, I mean, you can look at it,
but it's pretty much like this place.

01:37.930 --> 01:42.519
Bunch of cows, bunch of grass,
grumpy old man with a bunch of guns.

01:43.645 --> 01:46.022
Yeah, one big difference...

01:46.105 --> 01:47.982
He stopped having kids after one.

01:48.065 --> 01:49.276
[chuckling]

01:49.817 --> 01:53.113
Look, I'm not gonna buy a piece of land
I haven't looked at, Colt.

01:53.196 --> 01:55.657
Dad, look,
if we don't get this place,

01:55.740 --> 01:57.200
Peterson's gonna sell it
to Neumann's Hill.

01:57.284 --> 02:01.037
You understand that I have an appointment
with a cardiologist today

02:01.121 --> 02:03.165
to decide whether to cut me open?

02:04.374 --> 02:08.336
Look... I wish I didn't have
to bring it up at all.

02:09.712 --> 02:12.632
I mean, you said you were in, right?

02:12.715 --> 02:16.219
-We talked about it. It's a good--
-Colt, will you just fucking drop it?

02:17.137 --> 02:18.263
Sorry.

02:18.346 --> 02:21.683
Look, I know you're disappointed.

02:21.766 --> 02:25.270
But things have changed
since I said I was in.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.191
If we don't get this one,
there'll be other ranches.

02:33.986 --> 02:35.197
[softly] Right.

02:38.241 --> 02:39.451
Other ranches.

02:51.003 --> 02:52.214
It's cold out.

02:59.721 --> 03:01.723
[theme song playing]

04:02.242 --> 04:03.785
Man, this is bullshit.

04:04.577 --> 04:07.997
Did you remind him that after tomorrow
Peterson's gonna sell to Neumann's Hill?

04:08.080 --> 04:11.208
Yeah, of course.
Then he got pissed, so I just dropped it.

04:11.293 --> 04:13.628
And then he looked at me with that...
that face.

04:13.711 --> 04:16.005
You know, the one he gets when
he turns on an NFL game,

04:16.088 --> 04:17.507
finds out they're playing in Europe.

04:19.175 --> 04:21.719
Come on, guys,
your dad has a lot goin' on, okay?

04:21.803 --> 04:24.221
I can see why he doesn't want
to make the commitment.

04:24.306 --> 04:27.141
Yeah, everyone's going through a lot.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.561
Lot of changes goin' on.

04:29.644 --> 04:32.104
Man, it would've been so cool.

04:32.855 --> 04:35.275
Also would've been so cool
if our last name was Coors.

04:37.777 --> 04:39.028
Or Miller, or Hooters.

04:40.988 --> 04:44.492
You really think there's a guy out there
named Joe Hooters?

04:46.453 --> 04:49.372
Bill Hooters, smart ass,
and I met him in Clearwater, Florida.

04:51.207 --> 04:53.543
All right, we are heading out. [sighs]

04:54.377 --> 04:55.878
Same rules as when you were kids.

04:55.962 --> 04:59.632
No parties, no girls and I marked
all the levels of whiskey with a Sharpie.

05:01.384 --> 05:05.597
-Sure you don't want us to go with you?
-No, you two are in charge of the ranch.

05:06.473 --> 05:08.265
Abby, you're in charge of them.

05:10.310 --> 05:13.771
I recommend you keep the fire extinguisher
where you can see it.

05:13.855 --> 05:17.609
[laughs] Well, that heart attack didn't
fuck up that quick wit, huh?

05:18.901 --> 05:21.446
[chuckles] Look, I made you
a little care package, Mr. Bennett.

05:21.529 --> 05:23.197
It's got snacks, a Louis L'Amour novel

05:23.280 --> 05:26.909
and I photoshopped a picture of John Wayne
and Jesus on horses in heaven sayin',

05:26.993 --> 05:28.453
"Not yet, partner."

05:28.536 --> 05:30.079
[both chuckle]

05:30.162 --> 05:31.288
Well, thank you.

05:32.415 --> 05:35.585
So, if anything goes wrong,
everything you need to know is in here.

05:37.003 --> 05:41.716
Will and testament, funeral arrangements
and final estate plans.

05:42.341 --> 05:43.300
Ain't nothing gonna happen.

05:45.177 --> 05:46.763
Well, if it does, you'll see in there

05:46.846 --> 05:50.975
that I wanna be buried with my Winchester
and my Uggs.

05:53.520 --> 05:54.604
All right, we're gonna hit the road.

05:56.523 --> 05:57.940
You're gonna be fine, Mr. Bennett.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.066
-Thanks, Abby.
-Yeah.

05:59.150 --> 06:00.317
[Beau sighs]

06:01.360 --> 06:04.447
I love you, Dad.
Everything's gonna be all right.

06:05.364 --> 06:08.242
Somethin' lame Colt would say
in a moment like this.

06:10.161 --> 06:14.999
You go out there and you fuckin'...
kick your heart's ass.

06:18.836 --> 06:19.837
I ain't worried.

06:21.088 --> 06:22.674
See you when you get back.

06:22.757 --> 06:23.841
All right.

06:24.717 --> 06:26.177
Take care of the ranch.

06:27.053 --> 06:28.345
See you, boys.

06:39.649 --> 06:41.192
Love you, boys.

06:47.990 --> 06:49.617
All right,
now I'm worried. [clears throat]

06:55.665 --> 06:56.874
[clears throat]

06:58.000 --> 06:59.335
How do I look? [sighs]

07:00.503 --> 07:01.921
Like a hillbilly magician.

07:04.298 --> 07:05.925
Why are you so dressed up?

07:06.593 --> 07:09.471
Just taking, uh, Engineer Jen out
on a date.

07:10.096 --> 07:13.099
That trick you taught me about
treatin' her like a person totally worked.

07:15.226 --> 07:16.644
It's not a trick.

07:16.728 --> 07:19.439
Fine. A trick, a trap,
whatever you wanna call it.

07:21.524 --> 07:24.318
Either way, it paid off
and I'm good to go. [chuckles]

07:25.111 --> 07:26.821
Only question left is...

07:27.530 --> 07:29.907
do I put cologne on my balls?

07:33.202 --> 07:34.912
Not unless it's Miracle-Gro.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.335
-Hi.
-Hey.

07:41.418 --> 07:43.463
-Talked to Mom or Dad?
-Yeah, yeah.

07:43.546 --> 07:45.131
They made it up to Grand Junction.

07:45.214 --> 07:47.133
Headed over to see the cardiologist.

07:47.216 --> 07:49.636
Dad sounded good,
you know, usual conversation.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.804
He hung up on me after 30 seconds

07:51.888 --> 07:53.890
so the government couldn't
get a lock on his location.

07:53.973 --> 07:55.517
[Abby giggles]

07:55.600 --> 07:58.310
Good for your mom, making it through
a three-hour car ride with your dad

07:58.394 --> 08:00.312
-and not  Thelma & Louise- ing them.
-[Rooster chuckles]

08:02.732 --> 08:05.317
Oh, shit. Why you dressed like that?

08:05.401 --> 08:09.030
You tryin' to get laid while dealing
blackjack at the old folks' home again?

08:11.240 --> 08:14.911
No, you idiot.
I got a date with Engineer Jen.

08:14.994 --> 08:16.496
Abby helped me trick her. [chuckles]

08:18.039 --> 08:20.249
Well, I went by Peterson's... [sighs]

08:20.332 --> 08:22.168
see if he could give us
a little more time.

08:22.877 --> 08:24.128
He was super high.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.423
Said he's taking that deal
from Neumann's Hill tomorrow.

08:27.507 --> 08:32.178
Oh, and also that,
"Life is just a giant's dream."

08:33.596 --> 08:36.098
Uh, oh, and he said
if Kim Jong Il was in a movie,

08:36.182 --> 08:37.600
he'd be the Pillsbury Doughboy.

08:40.352 --> 08:43.022
Man, this sucks. This really sucks.

08:44.356 --> 08:46.609
But it is what it is, huh?
What you gonna do?

08:47.735 --> 08:49.529
All right, I'mma get outta here. [sighs]

08:59.205 --> 09:00.540
That was a mistake.

09:04.376 --> 09:05.795
So, you all right?

09:05.878 --> 09:08.380
I know this Peterson ranch thing
has gotta hurt.

09:08.464 --> 09:10.800
-[door closes]
-Yup, it sucks.

09:11.342 --> 09:13.720
Listen, why don't we go to dinner, huh?

09:13.803 --> 09:16.055
Eddie Pineapple from the  Deadliest Catch
is signing his book

09:16.138 --> 09:17.682
at the Red Lobster in Durango.

09:20.810 --> 09:23.312
I don't know, maybe.

09:25.064 --> 09:26.398
Are you sure you're okay?

09:27.817 --> 09:29.652
Just waiting to see
if you're gonna tell me.

09:29.736 --> 09:31.320
Tell you what?

09:32.071 --> 09:34.824
My mom accidentally told me
you got that job in Denver.

09:34.907 --> 09:37.243
Oh, shit.

09:40.747 --> 09:43.165
Colt, I was gonna tell you last night,
but then your dad came out,

09:43.249 --> 09:44.416
and then you said
how much you needed me...

09:44.500 --> 09:45.627
[gasps]

09:47.253 --> 09:49.839
That's why you gave me
the Big League Chew.

09:51.758 --> 09:54.802
No, I don't want it, it's tainted.
No, actually, you know what?

09:54.886 --> 09:58.222
You don't deserve the official bubble gum
of Ripken Baseball.

10:00.266 --> 10:03.019
Why would you tell my mom
before you told me?

10:03.102 --> 10:04.646
[sighs] Colt, you got a lot goin' on.

10:04.729 --> 10:06.773
It's kinda hard to say,
"Hey, I wanna go to Denver."

10:07.398 --> 10:09.191
Oh, well, that's great.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.235
So, you just...
you already made up your mind, huh?

10:11.318 --> 10:13.780
No, I haven't.
Would I like to go? Yes.

10:13.863 --> 10:16.282
-But can't we talk about it?
-Okay, yeah, yeah. Let's talk about it.

10:16.365 --> 10:18.993
I'll go first. Abby, don't go to Denver.
Okay, your turn.

10:21.287 --> 10:22.955
Colt, there's no jobs here, okay?

10:23.039 --> 10:25.291
As soon as somethin' comes up,
I'll move back.

10:25.374 --> 10:27.627
But think about it.
You just lost the Peterson ranch.

10:27.710 --> 10:29.962
We need to be a two-income family.

10:31.380 --> 10:32.674
How's this gonna work?

10:33.299 --> 10:35.301
What, we're gonna get married
and you're gonna go to Denver

10:35.384 --> 10:38.512
while I go on our honeymoon alone
to the NFL Hall of Fame?

10:42.391 --> 10:46.270
You're supposed to be there to cause
a distraction while I hang up my jersey!

10:49.315 --> 10:50.775
Actually, I... [sighs]

10:51.901 --> 10:54.153
I gotta go to Denver
before we get married.

10:55.321 --> 10:56.864
The job starts on Monday.

10:59.241 --> 11:00.576
-What?
-Yeah.

11:05.164 --> 11:07.166
Well, that's just fucking great.

11:09.585 --> 11:11.963
Today, I lost my ranch and my wife.

11:12.046 --> 11:14.423
Oh, God. You didn't lose me, okay?

11:14.506 --> 11:15.507
We're gonna get married.

11:15.591 --> 11:16.926
-Everything is gonna be fine.
-Yeah?

11:17.009 --> 11:19.887
And how are we gonna plan a wedding
when you're six hours away?

11:19.971 --> 11:23.432
Oh, shit, I got an idea,
let's get married over Snapchat!

11:26.352 --> 11:29.605
Yeah, yeah, that way we can both
have cats for heads!

11:34.861 --> 11:36.695
Sorry, I just have to handle this.

11:36.779 --> 11:40.616
Apparently, some senator showed up
to support the pipeline protest.

11:40.699 --> 11:42.785
Oh, shit. Well, how do you handle that?

11:42.869 --> 11:44.453
Ah, it's always the same.

11:44.536 --> 11:47.206
We sit him down,
pull out a chart showing him

11:47.289 --> 11:52.128
the economic benefits of the pipeline
versus its limited environmental impact.

11:52.211 --> 11:56.799
And then taped to the back of the chart
is a check to his campaign for $100,000.

11:58.885 --> 12:01.470
Shit, my dad was right.

12:01.553 --> 12:03.139
The system really is rigged, huh?

12:04.306 --> 12:06.308
Hey, you know anything about Roswell?

12:07.518 --> 12:10.897
Hey, why did you bring whiskey?
We are in a museum.

12:10.980 --> 12:13.524
[laughs] Well, I think you just answered
your own question.

12:15.109 --> 12:16.819
Oh, my God!

12:16.903 --> 12:20.489
The Mohs scale
of relative mineral hardness.

12:20.572 --> 12:22.658
-[sighs]
-I had this poster in my dorm room.

12:22.741 --> 12:23.742
[chuckles]

12:23.826 --> 12:26.037
I bet I know what you didn't have
in your dorm room.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.163
Friends.

12:30.582 --> 12:33.419
Hey, check out what's harder than diamond.

12:33.502 --> 12:34.711
Nothing's harder than...

12:35.838 --> 12:37.714
"Rooster's penis."

12:40.051 --> 12:41.427
Yep.

12:41.510 --> 12:43.429
They keep erasing it,
so I got an annual pass

12:43.512 --> 12:46.057
so I can get in here once a week
and touch it up.

12:46.891 --> 12:50.019
Wow! You're a member of a museum?

12:50.102 --> 12:51.896
I would've lost
a lot of money on that one.

12:51.979 --> 12:53.022
[chuckles]

12:53.105 --> 12:56.275
Well, you know, rocks are pretty badass.

12:57.734 --> 12:58.861
Fun fact... [sighs]

12:58.945 --> 13:03.115
the old Mars Curiosity rover
was analyzing this rock.

13:03.199 --> 13:07.036
Turns out...
had a very high feldspar content.

13:07.619 --> 13:12.666
And on Earth, 66% of feldspar
is consumed in glassmaking.

13:14.710 --> 13:17.338
Okay, you just quoted Wikipedia.

13:17.421 --> 13:21.092
-[chuckles] No, I didn't.
-Yes, you did.

13:21.175 --> 13:23.302
I know because I edit that page.

13:23.385 --> 13:28.515
Well, fun fact,
I edit all of the tectosilicate pages.

13:30.852 --> 13:32.854
I don't think you know
what a fun fact is.

13:35.147 --> 13:38.067
-Did you study to impress me?
-Oh, please.

13:38.150 --> 13:40.527
I didn't even study
to graduate high school.

13:40.611 --> 13:43.114
Did you graduate high school?

13:45.407 --> 13:46.909
It's not important. [sighs]

13:48.660 --> 13:50.746
All right, yeah,
maybe I did a little research.

13:50.829 --> 13:55.126
You know, haven't exactly
dated a girl like you before.

13:55.209 --> 13:57.586
I'm not sure I'd say we're dating.

13:57.669 --> 13:59.546
Yeah, no, 'course not. [chuckles]

14:01.465 --> 14:03.592
-What are we doin'?
-I don't know.

14:04.343 --> 14:08.430
I mean, we have fun even though
we don't have a lot in common.

14:08.514 --> 14:11.725
I mean, you're a redneck rancher
and I'm a nerdy geologist.

14:12.601 --> 14:16.939
That sounds like a very specific
and awesome porn.

14:18.690 --> 14:23.362
See, normally if someone said that to me,
I would slap them.

14:23.445 --> 14:25.114
Hey, I'm not mad at that.

14:25.822 --> 14:28.200
[chuckles] Why do I not hate you?

14:28.284 --> 14:30.953
[inhales deeply] Well, you know...

14:31.037 --> 14:34.081
25% charm, 85% beard.

14:35.041 --> 14:37.626
That is 110%.

14:38.377 --> 14:40.504
That's what the Rooster always gives.

14:46.302 --> 14:48.179
[country music playing over speakers]

14:49.471 --> 14:50.556
I'm proud of you, Beau.

14:51.933 --> 14:54.268
You went into a cardiologist's
office today,

14:54.351 --> 14:57.521
and the only person you swore at
was a parking attendant.

14:58.147 --> 15:00.816
$12 to park a car?

15:00.900 --> 15:04.028
The suit I wore to our wedding
cost less than $12.

15:05.321 --> 15:07.239
You should order anything you want.
You deserve it.

15:07.823 --> 15:09.325
Well, I want a steak.

15:10.701 --> 15:13.370
But when they tell you you're gonna have
an angiogram in the morning,

15:13.454 --> 15:15.414
you start to rethink a few things.

15:15.497 --> 15:18.000
Well, if anything,
this is the time to do it.

15:18.084 --> 15:20.294
They're gonna go in there
and clean everything out.

15:20.377 --> 15:23.755
Sort of like spilling crumbs on the carpet
before you vacuum.

15:25.925 --> 15:26.926
Fuck it.

15:28.135 --> 15:30.096
-Thirty-two ounce ribeye.
-[chuckles]

15:30.179 --> 15:33.015
That heart doctor's gonna earn
his paycheck.

15:35.851 --> 15:37.144
You hear that?

15:37.811 --> 15:39.230
Conway Twitty.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.233
Remember when we saw him
at Red Rocks in '74?

15:42.942 --> 15:45.694
Yeah, it started raining
right after he went on.

15:45.777 --> 15:48.905
Yeah, and we couldn't see
because the guy in front of us

15:48.990 --> 15:52.576
wouldn't put down his umbrella,
so you grabbed it and snapped it in half.

15:53.785 --> 15:57.373
The only thing an umbrella
protects you from is being a man.

15:59.083 --> 16:01.252
I should've taken you to more concerts.

16:02.128 --> 16:04.005
I should've done
a lot of things differently.

16:05.965 --> 16:09.218
Well, doesn't help us
to talk about that now.

16:09.301 --> 16:10.970
I should have been a better husband, Mags.

16:11.053 --> 16:14.056
Then again,
some things are worth exploring.

16:15.766 --> 16:16.976
No, I mean it.

16:18.644 --> 16:21.105
I put work before you and the boys.

16:22.648 --> 16:25.109
Maybe if I hadn't,
they'd have turned out better.

16:26.027 --> 16:27.319
Or at least different.

16:28.404 --> 16:33.492
I should've found some new hobbies,
read more books, traveled.

16:33.575 --> 16:36.495
Really? Travel?
Where would we have gone?

16:36.578 --> 16:37.829
Anywhere you wanted.

16:37.913 --> 16:39.956
-Hawaii?
-Sure.

16:40.041 --> 16:43.502
Any culture that buries a pig
over hot coals can't be bad.

16:43.585 --> 16:44.461
[Maggie chuckles]

16:45.921 --> 16:47.048
What about Mexico?

16:47.131 --> 16:48.215
Why not?

16:48.799 --> 16:51.510
A taco's basically a sideways hamburger.

16:53.595 --> 16:54.596
Paris?

16:56.432 --> 17:00.227
-Hawaii and Mexico would be fine.
-[chuckles]

17:00.311 --> 17:03.397
Look, it's not too late
to make any changes you want.

17:04.065 --> 17:05.399
Nah, I don't know.

17:06.442 --> 17:07.734
I'm 72 years old.

17:07.818 --> 17:10.029
You've made some changes this year.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.698
You have Joanne now.

17:12.781 --> 17:15.617
When you get through this,
you should take her to Mexico.

17:15.701 --> 17:20.039
Maybe you could wear a pair of shorts
or is that too revealing for you?

17:22.624 --> 17:25.794
The only thing that shorts reveal
is that you're not a man.

17:30.674 --> 17:31.800
Maria...

17:32.384 --> 17:37.389
give me a shot of Jim, Johnnie, Jack,
Jameson and Jose all in one glass.

17:39.475 --> 17:41.727
That way, I ain't lying
when the cop pulls me over

17:41.810 --> 17:43.687
and I tell him I only had one drink.

17:45.481 --> 17:48.650
-They call that a tornado.
-[chuckles]

17:48.734 --> 17:51.612
Why's that?
'Cause all the drinks swirl together?

17:51.695 --> 17:55.657
No, 'cause after you drink it,
you trash a trailer park.

17:59.161 --> 18:01.622
-Hey, Colt.
-Hey, Jerry.

18:01.705 --> 18:05.126
[grunts] Hey, I'm sorry to hear
about your dad. How's he doing?

18:05.209 --> 18:06.585
He's doing okay.

18:07.419 --> 18:09.338
They met with the cardiologist,

18:09.421 --> 18:12.174
said he has to get an angiogram
in the morning.

18:13.300 --> 18:18.013
Well, I'm sure you're worried,
but it's amazing the things they can do.

18:18.097 --> 18:22.058
I've got three stents, a pig valve

18:22.143 --> 18:24.603
and the liver of a 23-year-old woman.

18:28.690 --> 18:31.318
But it wasn't the part
I was after. [laughs]

18:33.695 --> 18:37.324
So, did you guys close
on the Peterson ranch?

18:39.451 --> 18:43.164
No, I, uh, couldn't get my dad to sign
before he left, so...

18:43.247 --> 18:45.499
Well, we'll just get Rooster to do it.

18:47.251 --> 18:48.710
-[sighs]
-What?

18:48.794 --> 18:50.962
[stammers] We can't forge
my dad's signature.

18:51.046 --> 18:53.132
It's not an application
for a Discover card.

18:53.215 --> 18:54.425
[chuckles]

18:56.843 --> 19:01.723
I did all your dad's legal work,
and Rooster has the power of attorney.

19:01.807 --> 19:04.226
He can act on behalf of your father

19:04.310 --> 19:07.438
in regard to all legal
and financial matters.

19:07.521 --> 19:10.732
We can buy the Peterson ranch
with or without my dad's permission?

19:11.733 --> 19:15.987
Colt, as an attorney
licensed in the state of Colorado,

19:16.071 --> 19:19.241
I am forbidden to disclose
any more information.

19:24.079 --> 19:27.499
I got two grams of mushrooms
in an Altoid tin

19:27.583 --> 19:29.210
that Rooster left in my truck.

19:32.254 --> 19:34.256
Your brother can do
whatever the hell he wants to.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.091
-[chuckles]
-Shit!

19:37.259 --> 19:39.094
We're buying the Peterson ranch.

19:39.178 --> 19:42.639
[laughing] Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's great.
Now, listen, the 'shrooms...

19:44.433 --> 19:47.853
are they Mexican or are they golden cap?

19:49.438 --> 19:52.774
'Cause I gotta know how long I have
to be out of the office.

19:58.447 --> 19:59.990
We're buying the Peterson ranch.

20:00.073 --> 20:01.074
Are you high?

20:02.326 --> 20:05.454
No, although I do owe you a tin
of magic mushrooms.

20:05.537 --> 20:09.040
Look, I talked to Jerry at the bar.

20:09.124 --> 20:10.959
He says you have power of attorney.

20:11.042 --> 20:14.255
And then... and then Peterson said
if we come over tomorrow and we sign...

20:14.338 --> 20:15.381
that place is ours.

20:15.464 --> 20:17.424
Ninja star! Boom! We're doing this!

20:18.884 --> 20:20.844
Boom! No, we're not.

20:22.137 --> 20:26.016
What? Wait, why? Did you hear what I said?

20:26.099 --> 20:28.602
You can sign the papers.
Like, you're the new dad.

20:29.811 --> 20:31.021
You're a fucking idiot.

20:32.523 --> 20:34.400
See that? You're a natural.

20:36.985 --> 20:40.989
Colt, Dad did not give me that authority
for some shit like this, okay?

20:41.072 --> 20:43.074
-[groans]
-He said he doesn't wanna buy the ranch.

20:43.158 --> 20:44.451
No, no, he does!

20:44.535 --> 20:46.995
It's just that things changed
because he had a heart attack.

20:47.078 --> 20:49.998
Yeah, man, that's right.
Dad had a heart attack.

20:50.081 --> 20:51.833
Wanna know a great way
to give him another one?

20:51.917 --> 20:54.336
Have him come home,
find out we went behind his back,

20:54.420 --> 20:57.756
spent every penny he had
to buy a ranch he don't want.

20:57.839 --> 20:59.090
You know what, shit, while we're at it,

20:59.174 --> 21:01.134
why don't we just go ahead
and register all his guns?

21:03.929 --> 21:06.973
No, man, no.
He already bought into this.

21:07.057 --> 21:09.393
He knows that pipeline money's coming!

21:09.476 --> 21:11.978
Yeah, is he gonna be mad?
Yeah, sure. It's like...

21:12.062 --> 21:13.897
It's like
when we brought home Drake.

21:13.980 --> 21:17.359
He said, "No dogs." Then within a week,
that dog's his best friend.

21:17.443 --> 21:19.611
Takes him fishing,
teaches him how to catch a ball.

21:19.695 --> 21:21.196
He was like the son he never had.

21:25.909 --> 21:27.411
Dad would fucking kill us.

21:27.494 --> 21:31.081
Man, come on, I know for a fact that
you want this as much as I do.

21:31.164 --> 21:32.666
Yeah, maybe I do, all right?

21:33.375 --> 21:35.085
Fuck! Look...

21:36.169 --> 21:37.379
you checked into all this?

21:37.463 --> 21:40.549
[stutters] Yeah. I called Bill
from the bank on the way home,

21:40.632 --> 21:43.635
and he said all you gotta do is sign
and it's on.

21:44.345 --> 21:47.138
But, look...

21:47.222 --> 21:48.390
[stammers]

21:48.474 --> 21:52.018
if you don't wanna do it,
I get it. [sighs]

21:52.102 --> 21:55.063
Oh, man.
[sighs] It's really stupid.

21:58.233 --> 21:59.985
All right, let's do it.

22:00.068 --> 22:03.238
[exclaims and laughs] Hell, yeah!

22:03.322 --> 22:05.073
Oh, I love you, man!

22:05.156 --> 22:06.658
Jesus, dude, get off me.

22:09.745 --> 22:12.664
Wow. You really are the new dad.

22:27.388 --> 22:28.514
Hey.

22:29.515 --> 22:30.557
Hi.

22:32.684 --> 22:35.771
Look, I'm, uh, sorry about
blowing up at you before.

22:37.481 --> 22:41.985
I got some big news,
kinda changes everything.

22:42.694 --> 22:46.532
Colt, I know there are three sizes
of Big Macs now and it changes nothing.

22:49.618 --> 22:51.412
We're getting the Peterson ranch.

22:54.289 --> 22:55.373
What?

22:55.457 --> 22:58.251
-[chuckling]
-Wait, how? I thought your dad said no.

22:58.334 --> 23:00.796
I know, we're doing it behind his back.
It's great.

23:02.380 --> 23:03.424
What? Behind his back?

23:03.507 --> 23:06.009
Colt, he doesn't even like
when you do things in front of his front.

23:07.052 --> 23:08.554
What are you talking about?

23:08.637 --> 23:11.056
Rooster can sign for my dad.

23:11.139 --> 23:14.142
Oh, and we bought a pizza oven.
He's gonna be too happy to even care.

23:15.561 --> 23:17.312
No, Colt, this is a bad idea.

23:18.063 --> 23:20.941
Look, if your dad wanted
to sign those papers, he would have.

23:25.153 --> 23:26.822
I don't wanna fight about this.

23:26.905 --> 23:28.740
I mean, we're doin' it.

23:28.824 --> 23:30.200
So, let's look at the good news.

23:30.283 --> 23:32.368
You don't have to take
that job in Denver anymore.

23:32.453 --> 23:34.705
It's like, boom! We're back on track.

23:35.747 --> 23:39.417
Whether you get the Peterson ranch or not,
I still want to take the job.

23:39.501 --> 23:43.379
Wow, the booms really
aren't working today. I...

23:45.924 --> 23:48.760
Abby, I love you.

23:49.845 --> 23:51.513
Yeah. Hey, you know, the whole...

23:51.597 --> 23:54.766
the whole reason to get this ranch
was so we could live there together.

23:55.433 --> 23:57.769
I know and I love you, too.

23:57.853 --> 24:01.106
And none of this is gonna
change that, okay?

24:01.189 --> 24:03.817
I mean, as important
as the Peterson ranch is to you,

24:03.900 --> 24:06.069
that's how important this job is to me.

24:08.614 --> 24:10.240
Let me get this straight. So...

24:11.908 --> 24:14.077
you're choosing your career
over our relationship?

24:14.160 --> 24:17.998
No, I'm not saying that at all.
But why can't I have both?

24:18.081 --> 24:20.709
Because long-distance relationships
don't work.

24:20.792 --> 24:22.252
I don't care what people say, it's...

24:22.335 --> 24:24.796
Yeah, first, you promise you're gonna
see each other every weekend.

24:24.880 --> 24:25.922
And then it's every month.

24:26.006 --> 24:29.134
And then, next thing you know,
you're faking orgasms over Skype.

24:32.387 --> 24:35.390
Are you saying that after everything
that we've been through,

24:35.473 --> 24:38.059
being 300 miles apart
is something we can't handle?

24:38.143 --> 24:40.228
I'm saying if you go to Denver,

24:40.311 --> 24:42.939
it's the first step
to the end of our relationship.

24:43.023 --> 24:46.317
Wow. Well, I guess I have more faith in us
than you do.

24:55.326 --> 24:57.412
-Hey, Joanne.
-Oh, hey, Beau.

24:57.495 --> 24:58.580
-What are you doing here?
-[chuckles]

24:58.664 --> 25:00.791
Oh, I called her.
She should be here.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.419
Well, it's great to see you
but you didn't have to come.

25:04.502 --> 25:06.046
Well, I wanted to.

25:06.838 --> 25:08.048
Mainly because at some point,

25:08.131 --> 25:10.425
they're gonna put you in one of those
little backless gowns,

25:10.508 --> 25:12.177
and I wasn't gonna
miss that for the world.

25:13.094 --> 25:15.263
Like I said, you didn't have to come.

25:15.346 --> 25:16.514
I would have been here sooner,

25:16.598 --> 25:18.934
but I was driving around
that parking lot forever.

25:19.017 --> 25:20.852
-Yeah.
-I finally parked in one of those spaces

25:20.936 --> 25:23.021
-reserved for electric cars.
-[chuckles]

25:23.104 --> 25:24.773
I stuck the plug into my gas tank.

25:24.856 --> 25:28.694
Let those assholes prove
my truck's not electric. [laughs]

25:28.777 --> 25:31.154
I parked on top of a Smart car.

25:34.032 --> 25:36.201
You know, you guys are perfect
for each other.

25:39.037 --> 25:42.248
-Mr. Bennett, we're ready for you.
-Oh, I don't think you are.

25:43.458 --> 25:44.710
Well, this is it.

25:45.460 --> 25:48.463
If anything goes wrong,
take care of the boys.

25:49.089 --> 25:52.508
-And you take care of Drake.
-Wait, why do I get the boys?

26:01.810 --> 26:04.605
-Hey, Mr. Peterson.
-Hey, boys.

26:04.688 --> 26:08.775
-Did you get everything taken care of?
-Oh, boy. Yeah, it was a crazy day.

26:08.859 --> 26:11.737
Rooster went down to the bank,
I went over to the lawyer's office.

26:11.820 --> 26:15.406
I stopped by a sub shop,
picked up a foot-long meatball.

26:16.825 --> 26:20.411
Then we met up at the FedEx Kinko's
and xeroxed a couple documents.

26:20.495 --> 26:24.791
I used that paper cutter just to cut
that sandwich, just perfectly in half.

26:26.668 --> 26:29.755
[sighs] Colt, I am pretty close to death.

26:30.421 --> 26:32.465
-Next time, just say yes.
-[snaps fingers]

26:34.342 --> 26:36.427
Hey, your father's okay
with you buying this place?

26:36.511 --> 26:39.264
Boy, yeah, you know,
everything's on the up and up.

26:39.347 --> 26:43.434
You can e-mail our lawyer,
but he's "out of the office."

26:46.021 --> 26:49.024
The, uh, red spot on here, it's not blood,
it's just meatball sauce.

26:49.107 --> 26:50.316
[chuckles] Yeah.

26:51.442 --> 26:53.695
I wanna make sure it's all right with you

26:53.779 --> 26:57.240
to live out my remaining days
here on my ranch.

26:57.323 --> 26:58.408
Oh.

26:59.575 --> 27:01.286
Of course. Yeah, absolutely.

27:02.037 --> 27:03.163
[Peterson grunts softly]

27:03.747 --> 27:05.331
How long do you think that's gonna be?

27:10.128 --> 27:12.172
Dude, have some respect, huh?

27:13.214 --> 27:15.676
Hey, you're gonna be around
for a long time, all right?

27:16.634 --> 27:17.803
[mouthing] No way.

27:21.890 --> 27:25.185
[sighs] Well, I don't think I'm gonna be
around here much.

27:25.852 --> 27:28.814
First thing tomorrow,
I'm heading to Thailand.

27:29.480 --> 27:31.858
You know, you can pay 300 bucks

27:31.942 --> 27:35.320
to blow up a Honda
with a grenade launcher.

27:36.988 --> 27:39.115
-Shit, we did that last week.
-[scoffs]

27:39.783 --> 27:40.826
Not even on purpose.

27:43.494 --> 27:45.038
All right, there it is.

27:46.081 --> 27:48.291
You sign, you own it.

27:49.459 --> 27:51.377
-Don't mind if I do.
-[chuckling]

27:52.253 --> 27:53.839
Uh, I ain't never won one,

27:53.922 --> 27:56.424
but this must be what it feels like
to win a Super Bowl. [chuckles]

27:57.467 --> 27:59.344
I'm going to Disneyland! [laughs]

28:00.345 --> 28:02.723
Not really. Never been.
My dad wouldn't take me.

28:06.267 --> 28:07.393
Holy shit.

28:08.729 --> 28:09.896
We fucking did it.

28:11.522 --> 28:13.859
-We got the Bennett Brothers ranch.
-[chuckles]

28:13.942 --> 28:17.653
Well, we got Rooster's ranch
featuring Colt, but we'll talk about it.

28:20.031 --> 28:21.657
-Well, I'm glad this worked out.
-Yeah.

28:21.742 --> 28:22.993
-You boys deserve it.
-Yeah.

28:23.076 --> 28:26.412
Oh, uh, just so you know,
I'm not religious.

28:26.496 --> 28:29.249
-[Rooster] Mmm-hmm.
-So if I'm here when I pass...

28:30.041 --> 28:32.878
you can just throw my corpse
in the jerky shack.

28:34.963 --> 28:37.715
You know, we could throw
your body in a Honda,

28:37.799 --> 28:39.175
blow it up with a grenade launcher.

28:39.259 --> 28:43.930
Yeah, that's a good idea, dumbass.

28:48.476 --> 28:49.770
The cafeteria was closed,

28:49.853 --> 28:52.898
but the comatose guy next door
had a whole pot roast dinner.

28:54.315 --> 28:55.650
Good call. [chuckles]

28:56.234 --> 28:58.820
If he wakes up, his family's not gonna
give a shit where his food is.

28:58.904 --> 29:00.113
[chuckles]

29:00.196 --> 29:01.656
Do I smell meat?

29:03.574 --> 29:06.536
Look who's awake. How you feeling?

29:07.328 --> 29:08.413
Sore.

29:09.330 --> 29:11.833
-How long have I been out?
-Four years.

29:11.917 --> 29:14.294
Everyone's driving Korean hybrids now.

29:16.254 --> 29:18.714
Everything went fine. They put in a stent.

29:18.799 --> 29:19.758
You're lucky.

29:19.841 --> 29:24.262
The doctor said there was a 98% blockage
in the artery they call the widow-maker.

29:24.345 --> 29:27.933
All those times I told you to drop dead,
you really could have.

29:28.975 --> 29:31.019
Well, thank you both for being here.

29:32.771 --> 29:35.023
I've been thinking a lot about the future.

29:36.691 --> 29:38.526
You and I are going to Mexico.

29:39.194 --> 29:41.822
I'm not going to Mexico. [chuckling]

29:41.905 --> 29:46.034
Why don't you take me to fuckin' France
while you're at it? [laughs]

29:47.660 --> 29:50.330
You two really are perfect for each other.

29:53.499 --> 29:55.919
Oh, yeah?
Great, that's great. That's awesome.

29:56.002 --> 29:57.838
Uh-huh. Yeah, thanks, Mom.

29:58.421 --> 30:01.424
Hey, uh, if you see any Vicodin
laying around,

30:01.507 --> 30:03.176
just throw 'em in your purse, all right?

30:03.259 --> 30:04.552
[beer can opens]

30:07.055 --> 30:08.348
Hello?

30:11.142 --> 30:12.936
-How's Dad?
-Oh, yeah, he's great.

30:13.019 --> 30:16.064
Um... something about a...

30:16.815 --> 30:18.441
Shit, what's that monster truck we like?

30:19.234 --> 30:21.652
-The Widowmaker.
-Yeah, they fixed that.

30:23.654 --> 30:26.825
Man! Oh! [sighs heavily]

30:27.658 --> 30:30.036
-Okay, I'm glad Dad is okay.
-Mmm-hmm.

30:30.120 --> 30:32.080
Oh, hey, have you seen Abby today?

30:32.831 --> 30:35.083
-She left like an hour ago.
-What?

30:35.166 --> 30:37.793
Yeah, she threw a suitcase
in her truck and took off.

30:39.295 --> 30:40.338
She say anything?

30:40.421 --> 30:41.756
Well, I said, "Where you goin'?"

30:41.840 --> 30:43.633
and she said,
"Mind your own fucking business."

30:44.675 --> 30:46.011
I don't know, seemed normal to me.

30:48.679 --> 30:50.598
I can't believe it.
She just went to Denver

30:50.681 --> 30:52.017
without even saying goodbye to me.

30:52.100 --> 30:55.186
All right, well, calm down, all right?
We don't know that to be true.

30:57.647 --> 30:58.940
I just got the ranch...

31:00.775 --> 31:02.693
and we find out Dad is doin' okay...

31:04.029 --> 31:07.490
and the one person I want to
celebrate with isn't even here.

31:08.783 --> 31:10.285
Yeah. [sighs]

31:10.368 --> 31:13.163
Well, see, it's a tough situation.

31:15.206 --> 31:18.709
You guys are the strongest couple I know.
I'm sure you're gonna work everything out.

31:18.793 --> 31:20.503
[vehicle approaching]

31:22.130 --> 31:23.631
-And there's Jen.
-Mmm-hmm.

31:23.714 --> 31:26.551
How does it feel to have a girlfriend
with a nicer truck than you?

31:27.385 --> 31:29.012
[chuckles]

31:29.095 --> 31:32.223
Uh, feels a little bit better than having
a girlfriend who just moved to Denver.

31:35.894 --> 31:38.854
What's up, person I'm not allowed
to call Sex Machine Jen?

31:39.814 --> 31:41.732
[chuckles] Loophole.

31:43.151 --> 31:44.819
I have some bad news.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.198
We're not gonna do the pipeline.

31:48.864 --> 31:49.950
What?

31:50.741 --> 31:54.162
Company decided the protestors
caused too much bad publicity.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.164
It's not worth it to them.

31:59.500 --> 32:02.378
Wait, but...
but what about our money?

32:04.005 --> 32:05.256
I'm sorry.

32:12.805 --> 32:14.807
[country music playing]
