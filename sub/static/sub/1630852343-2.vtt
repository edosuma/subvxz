08:20.209 --> 08:22.211
[footsteps approaching]

08:25.923 --> 08:26.840
[gasps]

08:26.924 --> 08:29.968
Oh, my God. This looks amazing.

08:30.052 --> 08:32.095
- Doesn't it, Emily?
- It does indeed look amazing.

08:32.179 --> 08:35.307
I am gonna hire you guys
for literally everything.

08:35.390 --> 08:36.892
The hot carpenter brothers.

08:36.975 --> 08:38.352
- Am I right?
- [Laz] [chuckles] Yeah.

08:38.435 --> 08:40.812
My older brother here
taught me everything I know.

08:40.896 --> 08:42.940
- [chuckles]
- Yeah. Nice try, viejito.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.608
This is actually my dad.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.360
But we get that a lot.

08:46.443 --> 08:48.070
A hot father-son duo?

08:48.153 --> 08:49.905
Hello, bucket list.

08:49.988 --> 08:51.573
Plus, you guys came in

08:51.657 --> 08:53.408
at half the price
of all the other bids.

08:53.492 --> 08:56.370
- ¿La mitad? Papi...
- Cállate la boca.

08:56.453 --> 08:57.913
Ooh. I'm sorry,
are you also learning Spanish?

08:57.996 --> 08:59.248
[clears throat]

08:59.331 --> 09:00.958
La naranja es naranja.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.542
[chuckles]

09:03.543 --> 09:04.670
Yeah, no, um,

09:04.753 --> 09:06.088
we actually are Cuban.

09:06.171 --> 09:07.631
I love that.

09:11.343 --> 09:13.178
Sorry about Daphne. She's...

09:13.262 --> 09:14.638
Better in small doses?

09:14.721 --> 09:16.014
Exactly.

09:16.098 --> 09:17.474
But she's not wrong.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.559
You're really good
with your hands.

09:22.271 --> 09:24.314
Don't leave without getting
that young chica's number.

09:24.398 --> 09:27.025
You and I both know you know
nothing about this, old man.

09:27.109 --> 09:28.277
Listen, youngblood,

09:28.360 --> 09:30.028
when a woman smile at you
like that,

09:30.112 --> 09:31.655
that has only ever meant
one thing.

09:31.738 --> 09:33.073
It means she wants to get
a little bit of that

09:33.156 --> 09:35.659
- "ay, papi," huh? [laughs]
- Stop.

09:35.742 --> 09:37.911
- El trabajo.
W-Wait, what are you doing?
- [laughs]

09:39.079 --> 09:40.706
[laughing]

09:40.789 --> 09:42.207
Okay, we're gonna get fired.
Come on...

09:43.208 --> 09:45.252
This run determines
your pace group,

09:45.335 --> 09:46.670
so run at your comfort level.

09:46.753 --> 09:49.214
Let's go! Let's go, let's go!

09:50.215 --> 09:52.175
- First time?
- Yes.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.177
- [chuckles] Me, too.
- Oh! Thank you.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.637
[groans]

09:55.721 --> 09:57.556
How am I tired already?

09:57.639 --> 09:59.308
[laughs] Thank God.

09:59.391 --> 10:01.310
I thought I was the only one
whose obituary would read

10:01.393 --> 10:03.979
- "Murdered by Running Club."
- [chuckling]

10:04.062 --> 10:06.815
- Leo.
- Oh. Beatriz.

10:06.898 --> 10:09.067
Well, Beatriz... [exhales]

10:09.151 --> 10:11.028
..care to be my CPR buddy

10:11.111 --> 10:12.779
- in case one of us croaks?
- [laughs]

10:12.863 --> 10:13.989
Sure.

10:14.072 --> 10:15.157
- Ow. Wait. [panting]
- [exhales]

10:15.240 --> 10:16.825
What if we die at the same time?

10:16.908 --> 10:17.993
[laughs]

10:18.076 --> 10:20.245
Oh. [laughs]

10:24.875 --> 10:28.462
So, I know this is probably
a little bit random, but,

10:28.545 --> 10:29.880
if you're free tonight,

10:29.963 --> 10:31.715
maybe you'd want to come back
for the party?

10:31.798 --> 10:34.051
Oh. That's very kind of you,

10:34.134 --> 10:35.552
but, um,
my dad and I have plans.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.137
Espérate. [grunts]

10:37.220 --> 10:39.639
I'm so sorry,
but I have to cancel.

10:39.723 --> 10:40.891
You're free.

10:41.892 --> 10:44.311
Uh, really,
thank you for the offer,

10:44.394 --> 10:46.355
- but maybe another time.
- Of course.

10:46.438 --> 10:48.357
You're welcome to stop by
if you change your mind.

10:49.358 --> 10:50.609
Okay.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.404
¿Qué pasó?

10:54.488 --> 10:56.281
What the hell was that?
She's cute.

10:56.365 --> 10:58.367
Yes, she's cute. So?

10:58.450 --> 10:59.701
So put yourself out there.

10:59.785 --> 11:02.662
It's what your mom would want.

11:05.624 --> 11:07.042
All right.

11:07.125 --> 11:09.419
I promise I will...
put myself out there.

11:09.503 --> 11:10.796
I just need a little more time.

11:10.879 --> 11:12.130
Oh, so you got all the time
in the world?

11:12.214 --> 11:14.674
Must be nice.

11:16.385 --> 11:18.261
Do I refrigerate grapes
or leave them out?

11:18.345 --> 11:20.263
I legitimately don't know.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.057
You refrigerate grapes.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.058
[Nick] Huh.

11:23.141 --> 11:25.143
Apples, berries,
cherries, grapes,

11:25.227 --> 11:26.520
kiwis, mangoes

11:26.603 --> 11:27.979
and, oh,

11:28.063 --> 11:29.981
never pears.

11:31.024 --> 11:31.942
[Nick] Oh.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.693
Good to know about mangoes.

11:33.777 --> 11:34.986
I do love mangoes.

11:35.070 --> 11:36.196
Okay. That's enough
adulting for me.

11:36.279 --> 11:38.657
I'm gonna go read Vogue
in my bedroom.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.620
[door closes]

11:43.703 --> 11:45.330
[quietly] Look,
I know we're having fun,

11:45.414 --> 11:47.207
but maybe we need to pump
the brakes on the hookup game.

11:47.290 --> 11:48.667
Jorge almost caught us.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.669
- Yeah, I know, I know.
- If Jorge finds out about us,

11:50.752 --> 11:52.129
he's gonna think
I'm trying to blow up my life.

11:52.212 --> 11:55.340
Wait, why is sleeping with me
considered blowing up your li...

11:55.424 --> 11:57.342
You know what?
Don't answer that.

11:58.385 --> 11:59.553
So, what, are we just gonna...

11:59.636 --> 12:01.346
take a weeklong hiatus or...

12:01.430 --> 12:04.349
Oh, I was thinking...

12:04.433 --> 12:05.684
indefinitely.

12:06.977 --> 12:08.061
Oh.

12:08.145 --> 12:09.813
Oh, okay. Yeah, that, uh...

12:09.896 --> 12:11.565
- That's okay.
- Wait,

12:11.648 --> 12:13.358
what was that? Are you sad?

12:13.442 --> 12:16.611
[scoffs] Whatever. No, I am not.

12:16.695 --> 12:18.655
- Well, I'm kind of sad.
- I'm kind of sad, too.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.282
Look,

12:20.365 --> 12:21.700
we both know what this is.

12:21.783 --> 12:23.743
I'm rebounding and
you're basically a drive-through

12:23.827 --> 12:25.036
for horny single women.

12:25.120 --> 12:26.121
- [chuckles softly]
- But I like you

12:26.204 --> 12:27.998
- too much to use you.
- Yeah,

12:28.081 --> 12:29.416
please, use me, use me.

12:29.499 --> 12:31.084
- I...
- Look, look. Look,

12:31.168 --> 12:32.919
we both had our fun.

12:33.879 --> 12:35.464
But now it's time
to be grown-ups.

12:35.547 --> 12:37.299
[inhales]

12:37.382 --> 12:39.342
[sighs]

12:39.426 --> 12:41.136
You toggle between friendship
and the other stuff

12:41.219 --> 12:42.137
really well, you know?

12:42.220 --> 12:43.430
Like tonight.

12:43.513 --> 12:45.932
We'll just toggle
from fuck buddies to...

12:46.016 --> 12:47.267
I guess just buddies.

12:47.350 --> 12:48.602
Yeah. Yeah, no problem.

12:48.685 --> 12:49.811
Now I just got to figure out
how to maintain

12:49.895 --> 12:52.981
my 20-year streak
of midnight make-outs.

12:54.024 --> 12:55.942
Wait. That's perfect.

12:56.026 --> 12:57.736
I want
a New Year's makey-outy, too.

12:57.819 --> 13:00.030
[gasps] Let's be
each other's wingperson tonight.

13:00.113 --> 13:04.201
Yes. Yes, that way, we evolve
from fuck buddies to...

13:04.284 --> 13:05.577
real adults.

13:05.660 --> 13:06.912
- Yes.
- We're setting
sexual boundaries

13:06.995 --> 13:08.163
and putting fruit in the fridge.

13:08.246 --> 13:09.414
I love this for us.

13:09.498 --> 13:10.749
Yes.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.130
[laptop keys tapping]

13:20.008 --> 13:22.761
I'm excited to meet
your coworkers later tonight.

13:22.844 --> 13:25.388
Is there any hot goss
I should know about?

13:26.389 --> 13:27.390
Not really.

13:28.433 --> 13:29.559
Come on.

13:29.643 --> 13:31.478
I mean, who's a dick?
Who's weird?

13:31.561 --> 13:33.396
Who... slept their way
to the middle?

13:33.480 --> 13:36.316
[chuckles] I-I don't know
about any of that.

13:36.399 --> 13:38.360
They all seem pretty nice.

13:40.487 --> 13:41.905
Is everything okay?

13:41.988 --> 13:44.407
Yeah, it's fine.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.576
Just a lot of logistical stuff
with work.

13:47.619 --> 13:49.162
[whispering] Right.

13:49.246 --> 13:50.705
Right. Totally.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.333
[clears throat softly]

13:58.755 --> 14:00.340
[exhales]

14:00.423 --> 14:02.259
Why are we so slow?

14:02.342 --> 14:05.095
I think the better question is,
why are they so fast?

14:05.178 --> 14:06.596
- [pants]
- What are they running from?

14:06.680 --> 14:08.598
Their Lululemon
credit card debt?

14:08.682 --> 14:10.934
- [laughs]
- [chuckles] Come on.
Let's get back to you.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.602
- Things were just getting
interesting.
- Oh.

14:12.686 --> 14:14.521
I can assure you
there is nothing interesting

14:14.604 --> 14:16.731
about me taking over
my father's restaurant.

14:16.815 --> 14:19.401
- [scoffs]
- Unless you want the chisme

14:19.484 --> 14:22.195
that our head chef impregnated
one of our waitresses.

14:22.279 --> 14:24.072
[chuckles] What?
What's a "chisme"?

14:24.155 --> 14:26.700
[laughs, pants] It's Mexican
for "gossip."

14:26.783 --> 14:28.535
Oh. Do you like it?

14:28.618 --> 14:30.287
- Gossip? Yeah.
- [chuckles]

14:30.370 --> 14:31.997
As long as I'm not the one
knocked up.

14:32.080 --> 14:33.707
[chuckles] I meant
working at the restaurant.

14:33.790 --> 14:35.667
Oh. Yeah.

14:35.750 --> 14:39.421
I usually hover somewhere
between satisfied and...

14:39.504 --> 14:40.922
mostly satisfied.

14:41.006 --> 14:45.010
I like the people
and being part of the community.

14:45.093 --> 14:46.761
But, uh, the pressure

14:46.845 --> 14:48.179
- can be a lot sometimes,
you know?
- [pants]

14:48.263 --> 14:51.891
Got to make sure
my dad's dream doesn't go under.

14:51.975 --> 14:54.394
- [panting]
- But was it your dream, too?

14:55.604 --> 14:56.896
Uh, you okay?

14:56.980 --> 14:58.231
Got a cramp?

14:58.315 --> 14:59.649
No.

14:59.733 --> 15:01.610
I'm fine. It's just...

15:01.693 --> 15:03.445
Whew.

15:03.528 --> 15:05.572
No one's
ever asked me that before.

15:05.655 --> 15:08.074
[panting]

15:08.158 --> 15:11.077
Actually,
I wanted to be a nurse.

15:11.161 --> 15:13.455
- Even went to school for it.
- Oh.

15:13.538 --> 15:15.248
What made you change course?

15:15.332 --> 15:17.626
[inhales] My dad
had a heart attack.

15:17.709 --> 15:18.627
Oh.

15:18.710 --> 15:20.253
- Shit.
- Yeah.

15:20.337 --> 15:22.839
I dropped out
of the nursing program that week

15:22.922 --> 15:24.966
and didn't think twice about it.

15:25.050 --> 15:27.427
Of course. Yeah. Duty called.

15:27.510 --> 15:28.928
Loud and clear.

15:29.012 --> 15:33.058
So I split my time between
my dad and the restaurant.

15:33.141 --> 15:35.226
And I guess I...

15:35.310 --> 15:38.897
always thought I'd go back
and finish up my degree, but...

15:38.980 --> 15:40.315
whew,

15:40.398 --> 15:42.651
time really snuck up on me.

15:44.402 --> 15:46.237
Oh, I'm so sorry.

15:46.321 --> 15:49.449
Wow. Nothing worse
than a sweaty old woman

15:49.532 --> 15:51.284
whining about her life.

15:51.368 --> 15:52.911
First of all, you aren't old.

15:52.994 --> 15:54.412
And just so we're clear,

15:54.496 --> 15:55.789
you make that sweat look good.

15:55.872 --> 15:56.998
- Oh. [chuckles]
- [chuckles]

15:57.082 --> 15:59.334
Thank you.
You are sweet for saying that.

15:59.417 --> 16:00.669
You sure it wasn't creepy?

16:00.752 --> 16:02.212
- [laughs] No.
- [chuckles]

16:02.295 --> 16:04.047
- I didn't hate it. [chuckles]
- [chuckles]

16:04.130 --> 16:05.465
Oh. Come on.

16:05.548 --> 16:06.591
- We better catch up.
- Oh, really?

16:06.675 --> 16:08.259
- Yeah. I mean...
- Okay.

16:08.343 --> 16:10.011
...got to make it look
like we're trying.

16:10.095 --> 16:12.555
- [panting] Okay.
- [panting]

16:15.850 --> 16:17.852
- [soft chatter]
- [indistinct P.A. announcement]

16:19.312 --> 16:20.563
Oh.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.857
Never seen you not
in a lab coat before.

16:22.941 --> 16:24.067
Disappointed?

16:24.150 --> 16:25.402
Uh-uh.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.237
Good. Shall we?

16:28.279 --> 16:30.448
[phone buzzing]

16:30.532 --> 16:31.533
Shit.

16:31.616 --> 16:33.368
I just got called into the ER.

16:33.451 --> 16:35.078
They're short-staffed
because of the holiday.

16:35.161 --> 16:37.330
Oh, yeah, New Year's
is the worst in the ER.

16:37.414 --> 16:38.456
- I'm surprised
I haven't gotten...
- [buzzing]

16:40.417 --> 16:43.211
[sighs] Looks like I got a few
last-minute consults of my own.

16:43.294 --> 16:44.671
Rain check?

16:44.754 --> 16:46.005
Sure.

16:47.048 --> 16:47.966
How's Tuesday?

16:48.049 --> 16:49.300
I'm in the CCU until 4:00.

16:49.384 --> 16:51.010
Slammed until 9:00. Wednesday?

16:51.094 --> 16:52.721
Not happening.
Scheduled for an overnight.

to be spending New Year's

17:23.209 --> 17:24.919

with your old man.

17:36.264 --> 17:38.600
So I'll bring up a book because,
you know, that's my thing.

while we both realize

17:46.274 --> 17:48.359
we have nothing in common behind
our superficial attraction.

17:48.443 --> 17:51.112
I mean, could I have sex
with her? Probably.

17:51.196 --> 17:52.405
Probably.

just avoid all that.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.809
Yeah. Um, you walk around
the block with empty suitcases

21:07.892 --> 21:09.268
to invite travel
into your new year.

21:09.352 --> 21:11.187

house, knock on the door

21:11.270 --> 21:12.480

big "I don't want to be around
your family" red flag vibes.
