02:36.967 --> 02:39.375
- Allahu Ekber!
- Allahu Ekber!

02:39.475 --> 02:41.912
- Allahu Ekber!
- Allahu Ekber!

02:42.012 --> 02:43.287
Allahu Ekber!

05:50.008 --> 05:51.989
I think we're close, mate.

05:52.675 --> 05:55.143
I think we're very close.

08:24.650 --> 08:27.075
Told you there was water there,
didn't I?

08:27.175 --> 08:28.671
Told you.

09:13.008 --> 09:14.389
Lizzie?

09:14.789 --> 09:16.915
Everything alright?

09:17.490 --> 09:21.492
Arthur's worn through the toe
of his boot again. What does he do?

09:24.717 --> 09:28.458
The boys are all in bed.
They're waiting for you to read to them.

09:28.558 --> 09:30.700
- I'm bone-tired, Lizzie.
- Oh, come on.

09:30.800 --> 09:33.353
You know this is
their favourite time of the day.

09:47.842 --> 09:50.575
Prince Hussain called to the man

09:50.675 --> 09:54.392
and asked him why the carpet he wished
to sell was so expensive,

09:54.492 --> 09:58.447
saying, "it must be made of something
quite extraordinary."

09:59.050 --> 10:02.354
The Merchant replied, "My Prince,

10:02.454 --> 10:06.515
your amazement will be all the greater
when I tell you that it is enchanted.

10:06.808 --> 10:08.850
Whoever sits on this carpet,

10:08.950 --> 10:13.575
closes his eyes
and says the magic word 'Tangu'

10:13.675 --> 10:17.074
may be transported
through the air in an instant.

10:18.158 --> 10:20.777
Wherever his heart desires to be."'

10:40.675 --> 10:42.573
I hit water at 15 feet.

10:43.592 --> 10:45.200
Bit brackish but good pressure.

10:45.300 --> 10:47.517
With water we'll be able to
put stock in that valley block.

10:47.617 --> 10:50.148
They didn't even wipe the mud off it.

10:53.300 --> 10:55.033
It's been four years, Liz.

10:55.333 --> 10:57.575
You're so clever.

10:57.675 --> 11:02.058
You can find water but you can't even find
your own children.

11:02.358 --> 11:04.381
Why can't you find them?

11:06.658 --> 11:07.905
You lost them!

11:41.608 --> 11:45.075
Come on, Art!
You won't win any medals up there, mate!

11:45.175 --> 11:48.367
Yeah, it's two hours back to Rainbow,
we've got to get a wriggle on!

11:48.467 --> 11:50.050
- You got that?
- Yeah.

11:50.150 --> 11:52.293
I reckon I got it by now, Dad.

11:55.483 --> 11:56.450
Arthur...

11:56.550 --> 12:00.167
Look after me brothers
and keep me bloody head down.

12:00.467 --> 12:02.114
I know.

12:17.533 --> 12:20.006
- Love you, Dad
- See you, Dad!

13:13.942 --> 13:15.489
Lizzie?

13:17.842 --> 13:18.908
Lizzie!

13:24.967 --> 13:26.514
Lizzie?!

13:29.925 --> 13:33.032
Lizzie! Lizzie!

14:10.550 --> 14:14.617
You understand, in all conscience,

14:14.717 --> 14:17.367
I could not bury your wife
in consecrated ground

14:17.467 --> 14:20.161
if I thought she had taken her own life.

14:21.200 --> 14:25.224
Consecrated ground
is his promise to the faithful.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.970
She fell in and drowned,
so your conscience is clear.

14:32.967 --> 14:36.867
Three sons killed.
That was quite an ordeal for Eliza.

14:36.967 --> 14:41.850
As the book of Job teaches us,
God sets these trials for a reason.

14:41.950 --> 14:47.156
Many families in the district have made
similar sacrifices for king and country.

14:50.467 --> 14:53.242
You know,
you have a gall coming in here,

14:53.342 --> 14:54.550
making demands.

14:54.850 --> 14:57.467
You haven't stepped inside this place
for four years,

14:57.567 --> 15:00.408
you haven't been to confession,

15:00.508 --> 15:02.217
you're all but lost to God.

15:02.317 --> 15:03.533
Yes.

15:03.633 --> 15:06.033
And you and God can feed me
to the pigs for all I care.

15:06.133 --> 15:09.092
But you knew this woman.
She was here every Sunday.

15:09.192 --> 15:11.850
I've dug the grave, I made the coffin,

15:11.950 --> 15:15.034
all I'm asking you to do is say
some words and throw some dirt.

15:22.900 --> 15:24.785
That cart of yours...

15:25.983 --> 15:29.175
would make a useful benefaction
for our community.

15:29.275 --> 15:31.218
An offering to God.

15:34.342 --> 15:36.870
Well, He might as well take that too.

16:00.025 --> 16:02.072
I'll find them, love.

16:04.650 --> 16:07.199
I'll find them
and I'll bring them home to you.

16:50.050 --> 16:51.697
Nearly there.

16:57.967 --> 16:59.614
Thank you.

17:02.775 --> 17:04.823
Not now. Later. Thank you.

17:20.525 --> 17:24.775
Major Hasan Bey
to see Lieutenant-Colonel Hughes

17:24.875 --> 17:27.484
- at the War Graves.
- We know who he is, mate.

17:31.758 --> 17:33.305
Righto.

17:47.567 --> 17:51.130
Four years ago they'd have given me a VC
for shooting that bastard.

17:58.150 --> 18:01.867
Lieutenant-Colonel Hughes,
may I present Major Hasan Bey.

18:01.967 --> 18:04.935
- Major Bey was commander of...
- Just Major Hasan.

18:05.050 --> 18:07.450
- Bey just means Mister.
- Yes. Indeed.

18:07.550 --> 18:09.892
Mr. Bey gave you boys hell
at Lonesome Pine, Sir.

18:09.992 --> 18:12.995
We all know who Major Hasan is,
Lieutenant. Thank you.

18:13.733 --> 18:18.300
- Merhaba. Hosh geldieniz.
- Hosh Bulduek. Turkce biliormusunuz?

18:20.550 --> 18:22.007
English?

18:23.317 --> 18:25.533
I see you have finally taken
the Peninsula.

18:26.016 --> 18:27.639
Yes.

18:28.258 --> 18:30.076
Lost the battle, won the war.

18:31.617 --> 18:34.343
Well, Sergeant Tucker here
will show you to your accommodations.

18:34.443 --> 18:37.032
Perhaps once you've refreshed
we could meet in my tent?

18:37.132 --> 18:39.726
- Thank you.
- Right this way.

18:46.175 --> 18:49.242
While I'm here,
I thought I'd make myself useful.

18:49.342 --> 18:52.842
If you have any horses that need any work,
I might go for a little ride.

18:52.942 --> 18:55.836
Preferably something with a bit of pep.

18:56.858 --> 19:01.158
Sergeant Tucker, acquaint
Lieutenant Greeves with Widowmaker.

19:01.258 --> 19:04.159
- She could use a workout.
- With pleasure, Sir.

19:09.008 --> 19:13.617
Now, we've already started work
in this area, in the Nek down to Hill 971.

19:13.717 --> 19:15.692
I assume they briefed you fully
at the war office.

19:15.792 --> 19:18.550
We would appreciate your help
locating our dead.

19:19.150 --> 19:20.258
Your dead?

19:20.358 --> 19:24.367
Lost over 10,000 ANZACS here on Gallipoli
and still don't know where half of them are.

19:24.467 --> 19:27.983
Some were buried properly but a lot of
the graves have been lost, overgrown

19:28.083 --> 19:32.350
or washed away, or their crosses were
pilfered for firewood after we evacuated.

19:32.450 --> 19:34.097
Retreated.

19:35.192 --> 19:38.050
- You were here?
- First Light Horse.

19:38.150 --> 19:39.550
What do you need of me?

19:40.478 --> 19:43.275
Well, the land has changed,
but you know the area better than anyone.

19:43.375 --> 19:47.211
I was hoping you could help us
locate the companies we lost track of.

19:54.900 --> 19:57.047
We can start in the morning.

20:06.275 --> 20:09.050
We lost 70,000 men.

20:09.150 --> 20:12.960
Here. At Ã‡anakkale.

20:13.283 --> 20:16.837
For me, this place is one big grave.

20:40.242 --> 20:42.908
I don't know what you chaps
were belly-aching about.

20:43.008 --> 20:45.502
This is a veritable Garden of Eden.

20:50.133 --> 20:54.425
If your troops had taken this hill
on the first day,

20:54.525 --> 20:56.718
we would have been finished.

20:57.383 --> 20:59.409
How close did we get?

21:00.275 --> 21:01.822
There.

21:14.900 --> 21:18.709
There you go, Sir. Your Garden of Eden.

21:40.617 --> 21:44.096
Joshua? Where are the boys?

21:59.942 --> 22:03.714
Ed, Henry, let's go home. Run!

22:21.650 --> 22:23.097
Come on, Ed!

22:25.667 --> 22:26.739
Boys?

22:28.425 --> 22:29.372
Boys?!

22:43.342 --> 22:45.083
Art!

22:46.183 --> 22:47.630
Ed!

22:50.692 --> 22:52.239
Get down!

23:07.514 --> 23:09.848
It's alright, boys. It's alright.

23:11.583 --> 23:14.096
Good on you, Art,
for not leaving your brothers behind.

23:14.196 --> 23:17.633
Hey, Ed, what's the magic word?
The one that makes the carpet fly?

23:17.733 --> 23:19.500
- Tonga?
- Tangu, you wombat.

23:19.600 --> 23:23.683
That's it... Tangu. Come on, cuddle up.
Get tight, close your eyes.

23:23.783 --> 23:26.183
- Ed's peeping, Dad.
- Ed, close your eyes.

23:26.283 --> 23:28.492
It only works if your eyes are closed.

23:28.592 --> 23:30.850
Alright, boys, let's get out of here.
All together.

23:30.950 --> 23:33.127
Tangu!

24:16.800 --> 24:18.300
Bugger off, the pair of you.

24:18.400 --> 24:19.683
Go away. No.

24:19.783 --> 24:21.517
- No?
- No.

24:21.617 --> 24:25.275
Anything you want my mama can make.
Hot water, no Germans.

24:25.375 --> 24:29.158
- No. Clear off.
- Beautiful hotel. Best room.

24:29.258 --> 24:30.758
I'm going to Gallipoli.

24:30.858 --> 24:32.758
How do I get to Gallipoli?

24:32.858 --> 24:34.175
I want to go to Gallipoli.

24:35.817 --> 24:37.300
- Mister? Mister?
- Gallipoli.

24:39.733 --> 24:43.758
Come to our hotel.
Beautiful hotel. Beautiful view.

24:43.858 --> 24:46.117
Anything you want, my anne can make.

24:46.217 --> 24:48.883
Maybe you can help me.
I'm going to Gallipoli.

24:48.983 --> 24:51.842
No, you're not.
No one goes there without a permit.

24:51.942 --> 24:53.767
You'll have to go
to the British War Office

24:53.867 --> 24:55.342
- in Sultanahmet.
- Where?

24:55.442 --> 24:57.258
- Sultanahmet. We go!
- Old city.

24:57.358 --> 25:01.258
And... I'd keep an eye
on your bag if I were you.

25:01.358 --> 25:03.401
Crafty little buggers.

25:17.442 --> 25:18.589
Oi!

25:24.442 --> 25:25.889
Oi!

25:31.542 --> 25:32.789
Oi!

26:16.150 --> 26:19.318
Mister! Mister! Where you go?

26:20.692 --> 26:22.739
Little bastard.

26:34.233 --> 26:36.550
Give me that bag, you little bastard.

26:36.650 --> 26:38.883
See, beautiful hotel.

26:38.983 --> 26:42.342
Clean sheets, hot water, no Germans.

27:05.150 --> 27:06.842
Hello.

27:06.942 --> 27:08.967
I... I need a room.

27:09.067 --> 27:10.758
You're from England?

27:10.858 --> 27:12.968
No. No, I'm from Australia.

27:16.292 --> 27:20.617
I'm sorry, Orhan has made a mistake.
We have no rooms.

27:20.717 --> 27:23.992
Your son dragged me halfway
across this wretched city.

27:24.092 --> 27:28.908
No, no, no, no. The boy was right.
Our best room is now vacant, Mister...?

27:29.008 --> 27:30.334
Connor. Joshua Connor.

27:33.900 --> 27:36.098
You are most welcome, Mr. Connor.

27:37.358 --> 27:40.415
The room is up the stairs.
Breakfast is at eight.

27:40.515 --> 27:43.017
Would you like for her to bring the tea?

27:43.117 --> 27:46.850
No. No, thanks. But your son did mention
there might be some hot water.

27:47.450 --> 27:50.467
It is shameful to lie.
You are a spoilt mother's boy.

27:50.567 --> 27:52.670
Oh, no, it's alright.
I must have just misunderstood.

27:53.933 --> 27:56.906
Please, please. It is his duty.

28:00.958 --> 28:02.856
Thank you very much.

28:14.750 --> 28:16.217
This your room.

28:16.830 --> 28:18.267
You seem to know where everything is.

28:18.367 --> 28:20.850
How about tomorrow you take me
to the War Office?

28:20.950 --> 28:23.652
- I'll pay you.
- Yes, you will.

29:29.858 --> 29:32.133
Towels for you, Mr. Connor.

29:32.233 --> 29:35.867
I am preparing you a hot bath
down the hall. It will take some time.

29:35.967 --> 29:39.550
- My son is no liar.
- He seems a very resourceful boy.

29:40.250 --> 29:43.777
He is. Very resourceful.
You have children?

29:45.233 --> 29:46.842
Yes.

29:46.942 --> 29:48.508
Three sons.

29:56.011 --> 29:58.048
What are they selling?

29:58.148 --> 30:01.859
They're not selling anything, Mr. Connor.
It's a call to prayer.

30:10.192 --> 30:13.506
- Your guide book is out of date.
- I didn't come here to sightsee.

30:13.606 --> 30:15.692
You should see
the Blue Mosque, at least.

30:15.792 --> 30:19.881
Even in my 'wretched city'
it is a beautiful place to find God.

30:21.150 --> 30:24.825
I didn't come here for him either.
I'm on my way to Gallipoli.

30:27.117 --> 30:29.057
You mean Ã‡anakkale.

30:29.600 --> 30:31.903
There is nothing there but ghosts.

30:34.567 --> 30:38.572
My son, he cannot help you tomorrow.
He is needed here.

31:05.567 --> 31:08.207
Have your bath and come back.

31:16.250 --> 31:20.508
I regret to inform you we do not issue
civilians travel permits to Dardanelles.

31:20.608 --> 31:22.800
It remains a very sensitive
military zone.

31:23.449 --> 31:26.358
In fact, our friends the Greeks have
made things even more complicated

31:26.458 --> 31:28.950
by invading Turkey's western coast.

31:29.150 --> 31:32.120
It'll be some time before
we bring order to this chaos.

31:35.100 --> 31:39.533
Arthur, Henry and Edward Connor.

31:39.633 --> 31:44.047
All served in the 7th AIF Battalion.
They all enlisted together.

31:45.150 --> 31:48.825
And they died together.
All killed in the one day.

31:49.525 --> 31:51.575
August 7th...

31:52.525 --> 31:54.324
1915, at Lone Pine.

31:57.667 --> 31:58.928
Yes.

31:59.028 --> 32:02.717
We do have the Imperial Graves Unit
on the Peninsula as we speak.

32:02.817 --> 32:05.133
They have a formidable task
ahead of them.

32:05.233 --> 32:08.887
You must understand, these men
on Gallipoli, they are experts.

32:08.987 --> 32:13.675
All I need from you is a piece of paper
and a stamp saying that I can go there.

32:13.775 --> 32:17.742
I simply couldn't, Mr. Connor,
even if that were my inclination.

32:17.842 --> 32:21.778
- I can find them.
- How could you possibly hope to do that?

32:24.542 --> 32:28.133
Do you know what the army used to do
with the rank and file dead

32:28.233 --> 32:30.492
after Waterloo, Crimea, Khartoum?

32:30.692 --> 32:33.642
They would dig an enormous bloody pit

32:33.742 --> 32:36.800
and rake the whole lot in
with a few handfuls of lime.

32:36.900 --> 32:41.658
No names. Horse, mules and the men.

32:41.758 --> 32:43.508
All turned into fertilizer.

32:43.608 --> 32:47.226
This is the first war
anyone has given a damn.

32:48.558 --> 32:53.267
My boys should be buried at home,

32:53.367 --> 32:54.765
beside their mother.

32:59.208 --> 33:01.306
Go home, Mr. Connor.

33:52.842 --> 33:53.714
Come.

34:28.433 --> 34:32.417
You have buildings like this
where you come from?

34:37.708 --> 34:41.945
...but he didn't give up.
He kept on fighting for three days.

34:48.533 --> 34:50.842
I told you my son had work
to do here, Mr. Connor.

34:50.942 --> 34:52.842
- Oh, I...
- He's ten!

34:52.942 --> 34:55.194
What would you expect him to say?

35:11.192 --> 35:13.545
Keep it. It's our secret.

36:33.908 --> 36:35.908
- Good morning.
- Mr. Connor.

36:36.008 --> 36:38.864
- Would you like some breakfast?
- Please.

37:19.058 --> 37:20.826
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

37:26.333 --> 37:28.170
What's he saying?

37:29.964 --> 37:32.978
My father hopes
you enjoy your breakfast.

37:36.108 --> 37:39.567
Would you happen to have a...
a boiled egg?

38:35.867 --> 38:36.935
Thank you.

38:46.217 --> 38:48.098
English?

38:52.728 --> 38:56.058
Your wife, he's asking where she is.

38:59.133 --> 39:00.451
She's dead.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.197
And your sons?

39:16.833 --> 39:19.300
Without papers,
you cannot go to Gallipoli.

39:19.400 --> 39:22.383
Take the ferry to the town of Chanak,
then find a fisherman.

39:22.683 --> 39:25.392
If you pay him enough,
he'll sail you across the straits.

39:25.492 --> 39:27.700
He'll have no need for British permits.

39:28.788 --> 39:30.019
Thank you.

39:40.183 --> 39:42.185
Mr. Joshua!

39:42.933 --> 39:45.958
Please, you find my Baba in Ã‡anakkale.

39:46.058 --> 39:49.607
Tell him he must come home.
Anne needs him.

39:51.183 --> 39:53.175
This is your father?

39:54.138 --> 39:56.700
- Who's the man in the hotel?
- My uncle.

40:01.633 --> 40:03.355
I'll have a look.

40:04.542 --> 40:06.607
You bring him home!

40:18.517 --> 40:21.630
So, what were you doing before the war?

40:21.730 --> 40:25.592
This is the Ottoman Empire.
There was no 'before the war'.

40:26.314 --> 40:30.118
In another life, I was an architect.

40:30.218 --> 40:31.903
I was a civil engineer.

40:34.146 --> 40:36.734
Sir? Are we expecting company?

40:42.483 --> 40:44.508
Whoever they are, bring them to my tent.

40:45.449 --> 40:48.433
Sergeant, grab a couple of blokes
and go with Lt. Greeves.

40:48.533 --> 40:50.327
Sir.

41:09.083 --> 41:12.433
Mr. Connor, I'm at a loss.
You walk off your farm,

41:12.533 --> 41:15.925
you turn up unannounced in this place
of horrors... and for what?

41:16.025 --> 41:20.542
Gallipoli is eight square miles of collapsed
trenches, bomb craters, barbed wire,

41:20.642 --> 41:23.875
and more unexploded grenades and shells
than there are pebbles on that beach.

41:23.975 --> 41:25.833
It is not safe.

41:25.933 --> 41:29.992
I know what date my sons
were killed. At Lone Pine.

41:32.567 --> 41:37.267
There's a map, and the last entry
in his diary is August 7th.

41:37.367 --> 41:41.175
Rest assured, I aim to put a name
next to every man out there,

41:41.275 --> 41:44.617
including your sons.
I'm sorry, but you can't stay.

41:45.617 --> 41:49.152
Tucker, escort Mr. Connor
back to his boat.

41:55.108 --> 41:56.485
Your sons.

42:07.228 --> 42:10.175
- Sir, dinner.
- Come in, Dawson.

42:10.575 --> 42:13.500
Wrap your laughin' gear
around that, sir.

42:13.600 --> 42:15.467
Yum-yum, pig's bum?

42:16.067 --> 42:17.644
Sir.

42:18.392 --> 42:20.240
Something you might want to see.

42:27.803 --> 42:29.591
Damn.

42:31.233 --> 42:33.485
Want me to arrest him, sir?

42:34.526 --> 42:36.376
And then what?

42:37.633 --> 42:41.708
Take some food down to him.
And a blanket.

43:21.275 --> 43:23.093
Not swimming?

43:23.693 --> 43:24.800
No.

43:25.200 --> 43:27.175
What are you doing with your farmer?

43:27.475 --> 43:30.008
There's a supply ship back
to Constantinople in two days.

43:30.308 --> 43:33.050
Maybe we could help him until then.

43:33.622 --> 43:35.925
You know what the chances
of finding his boys are.

43:36.533 --> 43:39.667
We have the day they were killed.
I know the area.

43:39.767 --> 43:44.217
Yeah, we both know it, but why change
everything for one father who can't say put?

43:45.026 --> 43:48.117
Because he's the only father
who came looking.

43:55.892 --> 43:57.160
Sergeant!

43:58.892 --> 43:59.909
Change of plan.

44:04.733 --> 44:06.283
Who's the Turk?

44:06.383 --> 44:08.425
Hasan the assassin.

44:08.525 --> 44:12.617
Saw us land, saw us off.
That dog wiped out half my battalion.

44:13.417 --> 44:16.800
He would've killed your boys.
We're all best friends now.

44:17.200 --> 44:19.128
I get to serve him breakfast
every morning.

44:21.108 --> 44:24.852
Don't worry, Mr. Connor.
Abdul's, not ours.

44:34.621 --> 44:36.925
This was our front line here.

44:37.955 --> 44:42.008
You were there.
Machine gun here, machine gun here.

44:42.108 --> 44:44.179
And one more there.

44:45.308 --> 44:47.585
We could see you.

44:47.885 --> 44:50.499
So many blue eyes.

44:50.599 --> 44:51.758
Mashallah.

44:51.958 --> 44:54.942
It is very lucky in Turkey
to have blue eyes.

44:55.042 --> 44:57.325
Everywhere, except here.

45:10.700 --> 45:15.675
Listen up, boys! Listen up!
We got to move up that left flank!

45:15.775 --> 45:19.417
Keep your heads low, push forward! Now!

45:19.517 --> 45:24.675
Stick up the nose of these jokers!
We're gonna take the trench tonight!

45:54.900 --> 45:58.342
They're throwing rocks, boys!
They're out of ammo!

45:58.442 --> 46:00.608
Let's get into the bastards!

46:00.708 --> 46:02.567
All as one!

46:02.667 --> 46:05.558
Let's do it. Let's do it, come on!

46:11.242 --> 46:15.383
You came in from two sides...
here and here.

46:19.375 --> 46:22.467
We built a roof
to protect us from shell fire.

46:22.567 --> 46:25.508
Instead we made a trap for ourselves.

46:29.108 --> 46:35.675
Inside it was bayonets,
knives, hands, teeth.

46:36.716 --> 46:41.067
It was so dark and close,
we did not see who it was we struck.

47:07.423 --> 47:09.215
Three days.

47:09.315 --> 47:12.883
We only stopped because we could not
climb over the bodies.

47:54.050 --> 47:58.383
As long as Allah make me breathe,
let me see nothing like these days again.

48:29.375 --> 48:33.033
- Are you alright, Artie?
- Bugger off, you two!

48:33.333 --> 48:34.508
Leave me!

48:35.468 --> 48:38.633
Yeah, righto, mate! Whatever you reckon!

48:45.258 --> 48:47.225
Leave me!

48:49.890 --> 48:51.700
No!

48:52.100 --> 48:53.512
No!

50:51.217 --> 50:53.185
They're right here.

51:18.925 --> 51:20.397
Sir.

51:41.017 --> 51:44.015
It's your son. Edward.

51:47.825 --> 51:49.644
No, I wouldn't.

52:11.642 --> 52:13.467
The bastards executed him.

52:14.620 --> 52:17.383
He gave the order not to take prisoners.

52:17.483 --> 52:20.675
He killed the sick, he shot the wounded.

52:20.875 --> 52:23.033
One shot through the head,
that's how they did it.

52:23.133 --> 52:26.133
Especially him. He killed your son.

52:26.433 --> 52:28.803
He gave them no chance,
that's what he did.

52:28.903 --> 52:31.967
Stop him! I said stop him!

52:35.002 --> 52:38.050
- Steady on, Sergeant.
- You killed my sons!

52:38.250 --> 52:41.883
You sent them, Mr. Connor.
You invaded us.

52:42.766 --> 52:45.053
Take him away. Put him under guard.

52:50.425 --> 52:52.308
I'm most terribly sorry.

52:52.408 --> 52:56.935
He has two more sons.
We should keep looking.

53:03.485 --> 53:05.052
War's over, Sergeant.

53:14.567 --> 53:18.297
- We found Henry.
- Lying beside him.

53:21.275 --> 53:23.633
How on God's earth
did you know they'd be there?

53:23.933 --> 53:26.164
But you haven't found Arthur yet.

53:26.264 --> 53:27.925
No, we combed the area thoroughly.

53:28.025 --> 53:31.092
Well, he wouldn't leave his brothers,
so he must be there.

53:31.771 --> 53:34.342
We'll give Henry and Edward
a proper burial tomorrow.

53:34.442 --> 53:37.820
I promised their mother I would...
find them and...

53:38.675 --> 53:39.822
and bring them home.

53:45.017 --> 53:48.550
This is their home now.
It's not enemy ground anymore.

53:48.650 --> 53:51.575
They're among friends,
probably the closest they ever had.

53:51.675 --> 53:54.883
Leave 'em, they always will be.
Take 'em back,

53:54.983 --> 53:57.550
they're just a couple of dead blokes
in the cemetery.

53:57.650 --> 54:00.133
She wanted them buried
in consecrated ground.

54:00.233 --> 54:03.052
How much blood do you need
for it to be holy?

54:05.858 --> 54:09.801
You know we lost over 2,000 men
in those four days at Lone Pine?

54:11.025 --> 54:12.758
The Turks lost 7,000.

54:13.300 --> 54:17.945
We didn't take too many prisoners either.
I don't know if I forgive any of us.

54:45.765 --> 54:48.967
'The prince closed his eyes
and said tangu.

54:49.976 --> 54:53.017
He sailed through the night
to his father's lands.

54:53.117 --> 54:56.794
As the carpet settled gently
on the lawn of the royal palace,

54:56.894 --> 55:01.633
the sultan dropped to his knees,
salted tears streaked his cheeks.

55:02.511 --> 55:05.050
As he embraced Prince Hussein,
he cried, "My son.

55:06.493 --> 55:07.633
My son.

55:07.833 --> 55:10.710
After all your rich adventures...

55:13.617 --> 55:17.664
the magic carpet has carried you
on the four winds to this...

55:19.192 --> 55:20.980
your home."'

56:26.225 --> 56:27.947
Forgive my intrusion.

56:30.525 --> 56:31.875
Major Hasan,

56:32.075 --> 56:35.472
I wanted to apologise to you
for my outburst.

56:36.300 --> 56:40.217
There is a Persian saying...
may you outlive your children.

56:40.317 --> 56:41.542
It sounds like a blessing,

56:41.642 --> 56:45.243
but it is the worst curse
one can place on the head of a man.

56:47.275 --> 56:51.717
I had this list sent from Istanbul.
This is your family name.

56:52.617 --> 56:54.133
What is this list?

56:54.333 --> 56:58.592
If this is your son,
he was taken prisoner.

56:59.629 --> 57:04.144
He did not die here.
He left Ã‡anakkale. Alive.

58:07.708 --> 58:09.511
Joshua Bey.

58:15.349 --> 58:17.860
- Hello.
- Did you find my father?

58:20.908 --> 58:22.110
No.

58:36.458 --> 58:38.758
Sorry, am I intruding?
Is it is his birthday?

58:38.958 --> 58:41.283
No, his SÃ¼nnet.

58:42.331 --> 58:44.167
Oh, bloody hell. It's a private thing.

58:44.267 --> 58:45.133
- No!
- Sorry.

58:45.233 --> 58:49.758
- Do you want to see my scar?
- Thanks, mate. No.

58:50.259 --> 58:51.610
You have guests.

58:55.975 --> 58:58.050
Welcome back to Stamboul, Mr. Connor.

58:58.150 --> 59:00.269
- You are always welcome.
- Thank you.

59:17.483 --> 59:19.589
My apologies, Major.

59:19.689 --> 59:22.342
Admiral Calthorpe will have
to reschedule your meeting.

59:22.442 --> 59:25.067
Perhaps next Tuesday? Does that suit?

59:25.167 --> 59:29.092
Yes. If your Admiral could also
reschedule the Greeks.

59:29.971 --> 59:33.833
Allow us to handle the Greeks
through proper diplomatic channels.

59:33.933 --> 59:35.925
Let us not have another war.

59:36.025 --> 59:39.404
It's the same war. It hasn't ended.

59:43.808 --> 59:48.878
- Major Hasan, can you tell me the...
- No. I have finished helping.

59:50.308 --> 59:53.652
Mr. Connor, do you have your passport?

59:56.642 --> 59:59.842
You were specifically ordered
not to go to Gallipoli.

59:59.945 --> 01:00:01.670
I'm not in your army.

01:00:01.770 --> 01:00:06.258
All I need to know is the name
of the prison camp they sent my son to.

01:00:06.358 --> 01:00:11.692
If your son did not return home,
the sad reality is, he's deceased.

01:00:14.067 --> 01:00:15.800
This was the Ottoman Empire,

01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:19.933
one of the largest empires the world has ever
known, and presently it's being carved up.

01:00:20.033 --> 01:00:21.650
The Bolshies, they want the Black Sea.

01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:24.425
The French and Italians,
they want the Aegean.

01:00:24.525 --> 01:00:28.283
And currently, in Anatolia,
where the prison camps were incidentally,

01:00:28.383 --> 01:00:32.575
the Turks and the Greeks are turning the place
into a complete and utter blood bath.

01:00:32.775 --> 01:00:38.033
So where, pray, in all this madness would you
like us to start looking for your son?

01:00:38.233 --> 01:00:40.746
You said the prison camps
were in Anatolia?

01:00:40.846 --> 01:00:42.800
Who would have those records?
The Turk army?

01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:47.867
The camps are gone.
They're all gone. And so are you.

01:00:48.167 --> 01:00:50.311
Lieutenant, show Mr. Connor out.

01:00:51.817 --> 01:00:54.883
I will be at your hotel,
0400 on Thursday,

01:00:54.983 --> 01:00:58.575
with your passport
and a ticket home via Calcutta.

01:00:58.675 --> 01:01:01.519
A courtesy of the British Army.

01:01:01.633 --> 01:01:05.217
We will make sure
you will not miss that boat.

01:01:05.317 --> 01:01:08.758
I mean, have you bothered
to ask yourself, man...

01:01:08.858 --> 01:01:14.185
if your son was still alive,
would he not simply come home?

01:01:19.808 --> 01:01:22.661
Mr. Connor, please.

01:01:25.133 --> 01:01:27.758
My brother died
on that bloody Peninsula.

01:01:27.858 --> 01:01:30.467
My fiancÃ©e works for the Red Cross here.

01:01:30.567 --> 01:01:33.770
If it would be helpful,
I could arrange an appointment.

01:01:34.650 --> 01:01:36.767
That would be very helpful, thank you.

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:40.338
Well, Mr. Connor, I think you
can show yourself out from here.

01:01:40.438 --> 01:01:42.046
Good luck.

01:01:43.029 --> 01:01:44.726
Thanks again.

01:02:49.442 --> 01:02:53.275
Major Hasan?
I need to talk to Major Hasan.

01:02:58.775 --> 01:03:01.083
Nobody will tell me what prison camp
they sent my son Arthur to.

01:03:01.183 --> 01:03:03.708
Your army must have records?
Please, I'm at a dead end.

01:03:03.808 --> 01:03:05.433
Then now we are in the same place.

01:03:05.533 --> 01:03:09.448
I told you, I cannot help anymore.
You must never come back here, Mr. Connor.

01:03:38.650 --> 01:03:41.592
He is handsome, eh? Don't you think?

01:03:41.692 --> 01:03:42.925
Big, strong.

01:03:43.778 --> 01:03:46.025
I do not think about other men.
I'm married.

01:03:46.125 --> 01:03:50.925
No, of course. His equipment
is all there Ayshe Hanim.

01:03:51.991 --> 01:03:55.155
In need of practice, but all there.

01:03:58.275 --> 01:04:01.708
Anne, Joshua Bey
is coming with us to the cistern.

01:04:01.808 --> 01:04:04.925
No. It is just you and me today.
Special treat.

01:04:05.834 --> 01:04:07.992
I am sorry, Mr. Connor,
this is not possible.

01:04:08.092 --> 01:04:11.092
- It will not be proper.
- I understand.

01:04:11.992 --> 01:04:13.507
Next time.

01:04:16.575 --> 01:04:18.277
Oh! Mr. Connor...

01:04:19.983 --> 01:04:24.194
Perhaps if you were to follow 20 paces
behind, then there would be no shame.

01:04:27.639 --> 01:04:30.157
I will get my hat and my coat.

01:04:58.850 --> 01:05:00.467
You know where I live, my home?

01:05:01.167 --> 01:05:03.800
Sometimes it doesn't rain
for three or four years at a time.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.092
We have to find water that's fallen
through cracks in the earth.

01:05:07.192 --> 01:05:09.475
How do you find it underground?

01:05:09.575 --> 01:05:12.133
Well, there's the trick.
You have to feel it.

01:05:13.045 --> 01:05:15.008
And you feel it every time?

01:05:15.753 --> 01:05:19.675
No. I have dug a lot of wells
that just turned out to be holes.

01:05:19.975 --> 01:05:21.152
I'll show you.

01:05:40.816 --> 01:05:42.550
I have something of yours.

01:05:43.492 --> 01:05:45.950
Orhan asked me to find your husband.

01:05:46.550 --> 01:05:51.300
I hate this photograph.
Turgut is a musician, never a soldier.

01:05:52.302 --> 01:05:53.494
How long were you married?

01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:56.572
I am married.

01:05:59.942 --> 01:06:04.517
12 years. My mother had arranged
for me to marry someone else.

01:06:04.617 --> 01:06:06.933
But my father fought her.

01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:09.500
He told her,

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:12.410
"Why would we want our daughter
to be as miserable as us?"

01:06:16.067 --> 01:06:18.883
It is not easy to marry for love here.

01:06:19.378 --> 01:06:22.850
Maybe my mother was right.
Turgut was mad.

01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:28.170
Bills to the roof not paid,
music all hours, parties, lazy friends.

01:06:29.967 --> 01:06:31.535
I miss the chaos.

01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:37.842
I wish my mother
had arranged my marriage.

01:06:38.042 --> 01:06:39.508
You did not love your wife?

01:06:39.808 --> 01:06:43.217
Oh, I adored her.

01:06:43.677 --> 01:06:48.133
I was just so bad at courting, I think
she only married me out of impatience.

01:06:49.284 --> 01:06:50.592
But it was happy.

01:06:50.692 --> 01:06:54.422
Very. Until the boys were lost.

01:06:55.792 --> 01:06:57.965
It's good to know where they are.

01:06:59.233 --> 01:07:02.201
Not lost or nameless anymore.

01:07:04.396 --> 01:07:06.633
I was told my oldest son
was taken prisoner.

01:07:07.687 --> 01:07:10.258
- So he's alive?
- I don't know.

01:07:10.558 --> 01:07:11.800
But you have hope.

01:07:12.601 --> 01:07:15.530
Hope's a necessity where I come from.

01:07:28.125 --> 01:07:30.218
Goodnight, Mr. Connor.

01:07:34.829 --> 01:07:35.618
Goodnight.

01:09:54.447 --> 01:09:57.367
Take care, your fate is in there.

01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:02.925
It is a silly peasant game.
You have to drink it first.

01:10:21.416 --> 01:10:23.119
Now we wait.

01:10:27.025 --> 01:10:28.777
We decide everything here by coffee.

01:10:28.977 --> 01:10:32.023
Business, holidays. Even our husbands.

01:10:33.655 --> 01:10:34.675
And that works?

01:10:36.274 --> 01:10:38.850
When two families come together
to arrange a marriage,

01:10:38.950 --> 01:10:41.276
the young girl serves them coffee.

01:10:41.376 --> 01:10:45.576
If it is sweet, she approves of the match.
If it is bitter, go away.

01:10:46.958 --> 01:10:49.782
The more sugar, the deeper the love.

01:11:07.044 --> 01:11:09.622
It is all peasant nonsense.

01:12:50.292 --> 01:12:51.258
Stay here.

01:12:58.008 --> 01:13:02.484
Stop! Stop, you fool!
This is not your business!

01:13:03.683 --> 01:13:05.800
This is what you want? The enemy?

01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:08.133
It has nothing to do with him!

01:13:08.233 --> 01:13:11.567
My brother was a fool!
You disgrace our family!

01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:21.317
Go! Go, you have to leave now!

01:13:21.417 --> 01:13:23.858
You've offended his honour,
he'll not forgive this!

01:13:23.958 --> 01:13:26.375
- He hit you!
- I hit him!

01:13:26.475 --> 01:13:29.771
You see, you understand nothing.
You will never understand!

01:13:30.071 --> 01:13:31.300
I thought I was doing the right thing.

01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:35.550
Yes. Yes, you and your sons
and your armies, all doing the right thing!

01:13:35.850 --> 01:13:39.342
All you did was rob Orhan of a father
and left me with choices like this!

01:13:39.442 --> 01:13:41.425
Then, please, let me help.

01:13:41.525 --> 01:13:43.633
Ha, So now you will rescue us.

01:13:43.733 --> 01:13:45.525
I didn't mean it like that,
I raised three boys.

01:13:45.625 --> 01:13:47.117
And where are they now?!

01:13:49.317 --> 01:13:52.867
This is not your world.
Go home, Mr. Connor!

01:14:12.625 --> 01:14:17.331
You don't need to go.
She gets angry with me all the time.

01:15:01.858 --> 01:15:04.281
You would make a good ambassador,
Connor Bey.

01:15:08.117 --> 01:15:10.942
You know him?
This man has dishonoured my family!

01:15:11.042 --> 01:15:14.758
My orders are to take him
to Major Hasan. Come here, Connor.

01:15:14.858 --> 01:15:18.292
First we will teach him
a lesson about honour.

01:15:18.392 --> 01:15:19.760
All four of you?

01:15:23.483 --> 01:15:24.530
Come on.

01:15:40.792 --> 01:15:43.792
I found your son's name
on a list of wounded.

01:15:43.892 --> 01:15:46.800
They take him from Ã‡anakkale
to a camp in Afyon.

01:15:46.900 --> 01:15:49.425
After Afyon we don't know.
Winters are hard.

01:15:50.204 --> 01:15:51.242
What, you mean he died there?

01:15:52.315 --> 01:15:55.200
No more records.
We are Ottoman, not German.

01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:58.283
Tomorrow you will be on a boat,
back to Australia.

01:15:58.383 --> 01:16:01.267
Jemal and I will travel east, to Ankara.

01:16:01.367 --> 01:16:04.217
Mustafa Kemal is gathering
a Nationalist army there.

01:16:04.317 --> 01:16:08.950
We must pass through Afyon.
I will ask if anyone remembers your son.

01:16:09.150 --> 01:16:11.526
- Could he still be in Afyon?
- No.

01:16:12.917 --> 01:16:16.092
As a soldier, as a father,

01:16:16.192 --> 01:16:19.196
I tell you, it is past praying.

01:16:30.370 --> 01:16:32.133
Mustafa Kemal!

01:16:32.533 --> 01:16:36.114
- Who's he toasting?
- Turkey's future.

01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:43.733
Look at him. He is the worst sergeant
in the whole Ottoman Army.

01:17:43.833 --> 01:17:46.300
Three times I have saved
this man's life.

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:48.683
Never once in battle.

01:17:48.783 --> 01:17:52.900
Look at him, like a peacock
with big moustache and gold buttons.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:58.175
'I love my wife, I love my children,
I have a big stick up my arsehole.'

01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:04.367
Tonight, we kill this man
with lion's milk.

01:18:04.567 --> 01:18:06.967
- Serefe. Forget.
- Serefe.

01:18:07.805 --> 01:18:09.217
Serefe.

01:18:21.140 --> 01:18:24.575
First Australian I met...
not to shoot at, to talk to...

01:18:24.975 --> 01:18:27.333
was a thief... at Lone Pine.

01:18:27.433 --> 01:18:30.125
This man waves a white cloth,

01:18:30.225 --> 01:18:33.467
calls out and walks straight
across no-man's land.

01:18:33.567 --> 01:18:35.675
He is carrying something.

01:18:35.775 --> 01:18:39.992
1,000 guns are on him.
2,000 eyes. But he walks.

01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:46.649
He reaches us and drops one
of our wounded into our hands.

01:18:48.258 --> 01:18:51.067
We shared a cigarette
and he walked back.

01:18:52.750 --> 01:18:55.481
- No one shot him?
- I should have.

01:18:55.781 --> 01:19:00.117
It's only when he got back I realised
he had stolen my cigarettes.

01:19:00.517 --> 01:19:02.554
And my lighter.

01:19:11.517 --> 01:19:12.990
Mr. Connor.

01:19:15.433 --> 01:19:18.300
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
If I could pick up my bag.

01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:20.723
Of course. Orhan put it in your room.

01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:25.621
I wish to apologise for all I said.

01:19:25.721 --> 01:19:28.893
I was angry. I meant none of it.

01:19:28.993 --> 01:19:30.617
I'm the one who should be apologising.

01:19:30.717 --> 01:19:33.758
You're right, I did fill their heads
with heroic nonsense.

01:19:33.858 --> 01:19:35.633
God and king and country.

01:19:35.933 --> 01:19:38.633
It was my job to steer
my boys to manhood.

01:19:39.254 --> 01:19:40.425
And I failed them.

01:19:41.206 --> 01:19:44.033
I measure a man by how much
he loves his children,

01:19:44.133 --> 01:19:46.976
not by what the world has done to them.

01:19:48.933 --> 01:19:51.583
They'll be here for me in the morning.

01:19:52.850 --> 01:19:54.576
Well...

01:19:59.473 --> 01:20:01.744
You can't travel on an empty stomach.

01:20:43.933 --> 01:20:45.758
No!

01:21:50.606 --> 01:21:52.425
Mr. Connor!

01:21:52.525 --> 01:21:55.154
Mr. Connor! Good morning.

01:21:55.254 --> 01:21:58.383
Come down here, please.
We've a very long walk to the dock.

01:21:59.019 --> 01:22:02.683
Lieutenant, if you'd be so kind
as to go down to the dock

01:22:02.783 --> 01:22:07.217
and speak to the captain
and make sure he holds that boat.

01:22:07.317 --> 01:22:08.950
Thank you.

01:22:09.150 --> 01:22:13.092
I saw him, I saw him clearly.
He's not dead.

01:22:13.292 --> 01:22:15.758
- You cannot go back.
- No.

01:22:16.055 --> 01:22:17.710
Connor!

01:22:18.858 --> 01:22:20.133
Come on.

01:22:20.233 --> 01:22:22.337
Kick that damn door in!

01:22:24.675 --> 01:22:25.627
Connor!

01:22:28.917 --> 01:22:31.570
Go up over the roof.
You can get to the city wall.

01:22:34.216 --> 01:22:35.453
Move!

01:22:36.146 --> 01:22:39.489
Where's Connor? Where's Joshua Connor?!

01:22:41.131 --> 01:22:42.691
Connor?

01:22:43.475 --> 01:22:45.152
Upstairs! Quickly!

01:22:49.558 --> 01:22:52.011
Be careful with the tiles.

01:22:56.142 --> 01:22:57.765
On the roof!

01:22:57.865 --> 01:23:00.699
Connor! Connor!

01:23:23.158 --> 01:23:27.323
He's alive, I know he is.
Please, take me with you.

01:24:19.859 --> 01:24:23.892
Ambassador, what part
of the Ottoman Empire did Australia get?

01:24:23.992 --> 01:24:27.342
- It wasn't about land for us.
- Always it's about land.

01:24:27.817 --> 01:24:31.592
We don't need any more land.
We fought for a principle.

01:24:32.092 --> 01:24:34.092
You fight, you die, you get nothing.

01:24:34.292 --> 01:24:36.360
Good principle.

01:24:49.483 --> 01:24:51.983
- A weapon, yes?
- In the right hands.

01:24:52.083 --> 01:24:53.581
Yeah?

01:24:53.681 --> 01:24:55.856
It's a game, called cricket.

01:24:55.956 --> 01:24:57.675
- Cricket?
- Yeah, it's a cricket bat.

01:24:57.775 --> 01:25:00.542
- You play?
- Yeah. Well, everybody plays.

01:25:00.642 --> 01:25:03.589
- Yeah, you need a ball and that's the bat.
- Show us.

01:25:05.192 --> 01:25:06.760
- You need a lot of space.
- Yeah.

01:25:13.147 --> 01:25:16.925
So the idea is you have the ball
and you bowl it with a straight arm

01:25:17.225 --> 01:25:19.469
and you try and hit the wicket.

01:25:20.183 --> 01:25:22.050
- Straight arm?
- Straight arm.

01:25:22.827 --> 01:25:23.572
Ready?

01:25:29.383 --> 01:25:31.817
That's the way. Straight arm.

01:25:31.917 --> 01:25:34.616
Englishers, always with rules.

01:25:44.358 --> 01:25:46.131
Give me the stick. Give me the stick.

01:25:59.125 --> 01:26:02.158
The Greeks are deeper inland
than I thought.

01:26:02.258 --> 01:26:05.547
They terrorise the people
and burn the towns.

01:26:05.647 --> 01:26:10.894
We used to be one country,
now we are constantly at war.

01:27:44.958 --> 01:27:46.217
Joshua, pick up a gun!

01:28:45.225 --> 01:28:47.484
I'm from Australia... yes.

01:29:24.350 --> 01:29:28.444
ANZAC Bey, don't invade a country
if you don't know where it is.

01:30:44.750 --> 01:30:46.778
Our horses need rest.

01:30:57.417 --> 01:30:59.550
- Raki?
- Ouzo.

01:30:59.850 --> 01:31:01.277
Same mother.

01:31:03.883 --> 01:31:05.418
To Jemal.

01:31:07.312 --> 01:31:10.860
It is a miracle
Allah turned a blind eye so long.

01:31:16.217 --> 01:31:19.495
I will ride with you as far as Afyon.

01:31:57.275 --> 01:32:00.624
Joshua! Where are you going?
Afyon is this way.

01:32:24.489 --> 01:32:26.057
He's here.

01:32:35.233 --> 01:32:36.376
Arthur!

01:32:38.642 --> 01:32:40.909
- Arthur!
- Joshua? Come.

01:32:53.542 --> 01:32:55.661
Arthur?

01:33:10.825 --> 01:33:12.526
Art.

01:33:26.757 --> 01:33:27.829
Dad.

01:33:28.958 --> 01:33:30.280
Son.

01:33:39.233 --> 01:33:41.185
You're here?

01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:44.101
Yes.

01:33:45.042 --> 01:33:46.443
Yes.

01:33:55.123 --> 01:33:57.360
Time to come home.

01:34:07.917 --> 01:34:09.599
I'm not coming back.

01:34:10.653 --> 01:34:12.577
None of us are.

01:34:13.667 --> 01:34:14.868
They're dead.

01:34:16.358 --> 01:34:17.875
I know.

01:34:26.642 --> 01:34:27.762
How's Mum?

01:34:32.925 --> 01:34:34.577
She's with your brothers.

01:34:40.283 --> 01:34:42.765
You told me to take care of them.

01:34:43.165 --> 01:34:47.752
You said, 'Look after your brothers'.
I didn't.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.396
Henry had his face shot off.

01:34:51.896 --> 01:34:54.157
One minute he was there
and then he just...

01:34:54.713 --> 01:34:58.282
wasn't. Ed bled out for hours.

01:35:38.142 --> 01:35:40.736
- Artie.
- Hey.

01:35:45.525 --> 01:35:47.577
I want Mum.

01:35:49.758 --> 01:35:51.689
Hold on.

01:35:51.975 --> 01:35:54.258
Someone will come for us.

01:35:54.858 --> 01:35:57.437
I'm a gut shot rabbit.

01:36:02.042 --> 01:36:03.334
Artie.

01:36:04.583 --> 01:36:06.627
Yes, mate.

01:36:08.483 --> 01:36:10.626
I can't shoot myself.

01:36:11.758 --> 01:36:14.401
They won't let me into heaven.

01:36:15.775 --> 01:36:17.529
You can't ask me.

01:36:17.929 --> 01:36:20.868
- You have to do it.
- No.

01:36:22.375 --> 01:36:23.747
You're my brother.

01:37:21.417 --> 01:37:24.236
Climb onto the carpet, mate.

01:37:24.933 --> 01:37:26.535
Let's get out of here.

01:37:34.050 --> 01:37:35.293
Take me home, Artie.

01:37:37.483 --> 01:37:39.927
It only works if you close your eyes.

01:37:49.300 --> 01:37:50.372
I love you.

01:37:59.525 --> 01:38:01.013
Tangu.

01:38:24.833 --> 01:38:26.159
I killed them.

01:38:28.042 --> 01:38:30.618
They can't come home.

01:38:31.034 --> 01:38:32.931
So...

01:38:34.443 --> 01:38:36.338
You see?

01:38:37.933 --> 01:38:40.277
It's alright to leave me here.

01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:47.604
I didn't lift a finger
to stop any of you.

01:38:48.733 --> 01:38:51.625
I killed your brothers
the day I waved you off.

01:38:52.517 --> 01:38:54.449
Arthur...

01:38:55.301 --> 01:38:57.170
your brothers live on in you.

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:00.997
You must go.

01:39:02.175 --> 01:39:04.419
It's too dangerous here.

01:39:04.667 --> 01:39:08.727
He's right, Joshua. The Greek soldiers
are here. I must leave now.

01:39:27.225 --> 01:39:28.975
How do I thank you?

01:39:29.375 --> 01:39:30.452
Teshekullar.

01:39:32.525 --> 01:39:35.214
Teshekullar, Hasan Bey.

01:39:44.858 --> 01:39:48.175
Tell your son when he's well...

01:39:48.275 --> 01:39:50.794
Tell him he still owes me
a packet of cigarettes.

01:39:52.142 --> 01:39:54.135
And one lighter.

01:40:07.014 --> 01:40:10.296
- Arthur!
- Dad! This way!

01:41:01.267 --> 01:41:02.710
Give us a hand.

01:41:07.699 --> 01:41:09.433
This'll take you across the valley.

01:41:09.533 --> 01:41:13.781
Once you pass the village,
head north towards the coast and follow it.

01:41:14.842 --> 01:41:16.244
I'm not leaving without you.

01:41:19.533 --> 01:41:22.556
I've buried your mother.
I've buried your brothers.

01:41:23.950 --> 01:41:26.178
If you're not coming with me
I have nowhere to go.

01:41:27.250 --> 01:41:31.179
Either we leave here together
or we'll die here...

01:41:32.243 --> 01:41:33.811
together.

01:41:46.408 --> 01:41:50.120
- Is it cold?
- No. It's freezing.

01:42:30.127 --> 01:42:31.892
When we finish here,

01:42:32.092 --> 01:42:35.345
why don't we see if we can find
some fresh clothes?

01:42:35.708 --> 01:42:37.558
Righto.

01:42:38.533 --> 01:42:39.856
Sounds good.

01:42:43.475 --> 01:42:46.794
'You want room, clean sheets,
hot water...'

01:42:46.894 --> 01:42:48.767
- No Germans.
- '...no Germans.'

01:42:51.375 --> 01:42:55.100
Joshua Bey! You came back for me!

01:42:56.483 --> 01:42:59.308
Welcome back, Mr. Connor.
Is this your son?

01:42:59.589 --> 01:43:00.564
Arthur.

01:43:01.658 --> 01:43:05.367
Orhan... help me show Arthur
our second-best room.

01:43:14.042 --> 01:43:15.889
She's outside.

01:43:57.967 --> 01:43:59.552
Mr. Connor.

01:44:03.575 --> 01:44:06.500
You speak Turkish like a villager.

01:44:08.075 --> 01:44:10.875
- Am I welcome here?
- All are welcome here.

01:44:11.275 --> 01:44:13.041
You don't seem surprised that I'm back.

01:44:13.525 --> 01:44:16.741
It was in your coffee,
weeks ago before you left.

01:44:16.841 --> 01:44:19.636
I told you. Everything is in the coffee.

01:45:41.908 --> 01:45:44.199
<i>Time</i>

01:45:46.323 --> 01:45:48.967
<i>Can be the enemy</i>

01:45:49.857 --> 01:45:53.523
<i>When you're locked in a world of pain</i>

01:45:53.623 --> 01:45:57.419
<i>Days go floating by</i>

01:45:59.773 --> 01:46:03.175
<i>And it just doesn't change</i>

01:46:03.550 --> 01:46:06.924
<i>It just stays the same</i>

01:46:09.733 --> 01:46:11.633
<i>Then you came along</i>

01:46:11.733 --> 01:46:15.316
<i>And showed me how to start</i>

01:46:16.452 --> 01:46:20.008
<i>Now the sun shines in my heart</i>

01:46:20.108 --> 01:46:22.575
<i>The sun shines in my heart</i>

01:46:22.675 --> 01:46:25.712
<i>I was so lost</i>

01:46:25.812 --> 01:46:29.342
<i>But now I'm found</i>

01:46:29.966 --> 01:46:33.342
<i>The song they used to sing</i>

01:46:33.442 --> 01:46:36.050
<i>On Sunday afternoon</i>

01:46:36.150 --> 01:46:39.258
<i>Love was my alibi</i>

01:46:39.358 --> 01:46:42.775
<i>For all the life lost</i>

01:46:43.275 --> 01:46:46.642
<i>Now you made love my reason</i>

01:46:46.742 --> 01:46:50.571
<i>You made love my truth</i>

01:46:53.358 --> 01:46:57.408
<i>You made love my truth</i>

01:46:59.833 --> 01:47:03.507
<i>And the sun shines in my heart</i>

01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:10.849
<i>Time</i>

01:47:13.067 --> 01:47:15.740
<i>Is now a friend to me</i>

01:47:16.583 --> 01:47:19.842
<i>You make me feel adored</i>

01:47:19.942 --> 01:47:23.849
<i>When I look into your eyes</i>

01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:29.708
<i>It's like I'd never been</i>

01:47:30.208 --> 01:47:33.386
<i>Never been loved before</i>

01:47:35.942 --> 01:47:38.283
<i>You showed me the way</i>

01:47:38.383 --> 01:47:41.627
<i>You showed me how to start</i>

01:47:43.108 --> 01:47:46.592
<i>Now the sun shines in my heart</i>

01:47:46.692 --> 01:47:49.208
<i>The sun shines in my heart</i>

01:47:49.308 --> 01:47:52.275
<i>But I was so lost</i>

01:47:52.675 --> 01:47:56.008
<i>Now I'm found</i>

01:47:56.580 --> 01:47:59.717
<i>The song they used to sing</i>

01:47:59.817 --> 01:48:02.675
<i>On Sunday afternoon</i>

01:48:02.775 --> 01:48:05.800
<i>Love was my alibi</i>

01:48:05.900 --> 01:48:09.179
<i>For all the life lost</i>

01:48:09.967 --> 01:48:13.367
<i>You made love my reason</i>

01:48:13.467 --> 01:48:16.916
<i>You made love my truth</i>

01:48:19.942 --> 01:48:24.401

01:48:26.425 --> 01:48:30.509
<i>You made love my truth</i>

01:48:33.008 --> 01:48:37.513
