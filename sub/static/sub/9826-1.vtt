00:29.840 --> 00:33.833
God said to Abraham,
"Kill me a son. "

00:33.960 --> 00:37.873
Abe says,
"Man, you must be putting me on. "

00:38.000 --> 00:40.992
God say, "No. "
Abe say, "What?"

00:41.120 --> 00:44.590
God say,
"You can do whatyou want, Abe,

00:44.720 --> 00:49.430
but the next time you see me coming,
you betterrun. "

00:49.560 --> 00:53.712
Abe says,
"Where do you want this killing done?"

00:53.840 --> 00:58.550
And God says,
"Out on H.ighway 61. "

01:29.440 --> 01:34.673
The Serbs have taken over this Albanian
village. They're killing everyone in sight.

01:34.800 --> 01:37.519
It's not a war,
it's a slaughter.

01:37.640 --> 01:40.552
The Serbian commander,
he's in that mosque.

01:40.680 --> 01:43.752
This is the third village
in a week he's destroyed.

01:43.880 --> 01:46.872
We are to identify
and neutralise him.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.913
We will proceed
under cover of NATO air strike,

01:51.040 --> 01:53.031
commencing...

01:53.680 --> 01:56.638
right about now! Move!

04:40.240 --> 04:42.196
I'm in the nest.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.117
Copy that.
Reagan is in the nest.

04:48.840 --> 04:50.910
Cover fire, on my mark.

04:51.600 --> 04:54.398
Three... two...

04:54.880 --> 04:55.915
one!

07:25.920 --> 07:28.195
- Sgt First Class Aaron Hallam.
- Yes, sir.

07:28.320 --> 07:31.517
It is my privilege
to present to you the Silver Star,

07:31.640 --> 07:34.200
one of our nation's
highest awards for valour.

07:34.320 --> 07:39.474
Your bravery, judgment and outstanding
resolve are an example to all soldiers.

07:39.600 --> 07:44.355
Your actions are the bedrock upon which
peace and democracy have been built.

07:46.520 --> 07:48.795
Congratulations, Hallam.

10:03.720 --> 10:05.676
What happened to you?

10:09.080 --> 10:11.196
You stepped on a snare, didn't you?

10:35.400 --> 10:36.833
Easy.

10:38.600 --> 10:40.397
Take it easy.

10:41.520 --> 10:44.193
Be still.

10:47.680 --> 10:50.069
All right,
let me have that...

10:50.200 --> 10:52.077
nasty thing.

10:52.200 --> 10:53.633
All right.

10:54.880 --> 10:58.350
Next time you see one of these,
you go the other way.

11:05.080 --> 11:08.311
Okay, here we go.

11:09.280 --> 11:10.952
You're good.

11:11.080 --> 11:12.559
All right.

11:15.600 --> 11:17.670
Now, get out of here.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.514
Anybody here with the initials JW?

11:36.640 --> 11:37.629
Yeah?

11:37.760 --> 11:39.398
- This yours?
- Yeah.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.156
What the...

11:42.560 --> 11:44.755
No more snares on wolves, guys.

12:22.680 --> 12:24.432
I got him.

12:35.680 --> 12:38.114
- He was down there.
- What?

12:38.240 --> 12:39.992
I saw him.

13:25.320 --> 13:28.312
You need all that equipment
to kill a deer?

13:31.440 --> 13:34.796
That's how we
make sure they're dead.

13:35.120 --> 13:37.475
You guys
don't look like deer hunters.

13:42.240 --> 13:45.152
When you kill with your own hands,

13:45.280 --> 13:47.919
there is irreverence.

13:48.040 --> 13:49.996
Is that right?

13:51.600 --> 13:55.559
There is no reverence in what you do.

13:55.920 --> 13:57.876
Where's your weapon?

14:05.960 --> 14:07.712
Holy sm...

14:39.360 --> 14:41.715
You're not here for the deer.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.432
What's that?

14:45.000 --> 14:47.753
Think you can
hunt me with those rifles?

14:48.680 --> 14:50.955
Your rifles against my knife.

14:52.520 --> 14:54.272
What are you, nuts?

14:54.400 --> 14:56.152
What do you think?

14:56.280 --> 14:58.032
Well, don't push it, asshole.

15:04.280 --> 15:06.475
Where the fuck are you?

15:06.600 --> 15:07.999
Come on, baby.

16:28.880 --> 16:30.632
Get off!

16:34.840 --> 16:36.193
God!

17:40.640 --> 17:42.995
A little antifreeze with that?

17:43.120 --> 17:45.680
- It's not that cold out.
- Maybe not to you.

17:48.360 --> 17:51.352
- Thought you were on the wagon?
- Wheels fell off.

17:54.320 --> 17:56.151
You running a fever?

17:56.280 --> 18:00.193
I'm tired of the goddamn cold.
Not too crazy about the thaw, neither.

18:00.320 --> 18:03.392
Get a hot water bottle.
Keep you company at night.

18:03.520 --> 18:07.035
I don't want one. I want to
go to California for a few weeks.

18:07.160 --> 18:09.515
Get some thoroughbreds,
do some fishing.

18:09.640 --> 18:12.359
The Yellowtail jump into the boat
this time of year.

18:12.480 --> 18:15.153
Yellowtail are not lying
this time of year.

18:15.600 --> 18:17.318
Hello, Ted.

18:17.440 --> 18:21.035
LT. How'd you know it was me?

18:21.160 --> 18:23.515
I saw your pigeon-toed tracks.

18:23.800 --> 18:26.234
What are you doing this far north?

18:26.360 --> 18:29.432
Van Zandt wanted me
to show you something.

18:29.560 --> 18:30.959
Personally.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.673
- Been a few years.
- Okeechobee, 1 996.

18:38.800 --> 18:42.395
Your agents got so scared of alligators.
One guy shit in his pants.

18:42.520 --> 18:44.476
- Mike Handy.
- That was funny.

18:44.600 --> 18:47.910
- You disappeared after that.
- I worked a few more, then quit.

18:48.040 --> 18:50.031
Been in Portland for three years now.

18:50.160 --> 18:52.628
We reached out for you
a few times.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.550
- Let me ask you something.
- Yeah.

18:55.680 --> 18:57.910
What the hell
are you doing out here?

18:58.040 --> 18:59.996
Working for the Wildlife Fund.

19:05.360 --> 19:07.669
You went to a lot of trouble
to get up here.

19:07.800 --> 19:10.030
- You're a hard man to find.
- No, l'm not.

19:10.160 --> 19:12.674
How hard am l to find
if you found me?

19:12.800 --> 19:14.836
Van Zandt thinks it's important.

19:14.960 --> 19:18.430
- He thinks everything's important.
- This one's different.

19:20.840 --> 19:23.434
I don't do
that kind of work any more.

19:23.560 --> 19:25.471
Why don't you have a look?

19:26.640 --> 19:28.631
I really don't want to go back there.

19:29.360 --> 19:32.557
All we're asking you to do
is take a look, LT.

20:28.600 --> 20:30.477
Can we get prints off that paper?

20:30.600 --> 20:32.909
- We sure can.
- And the door handles.

20:33.040 --> 20:36.237
I'm concerned
about the number of squad agents.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.316
I want to take these guys alive.

20:38.440 --> 20:41.477
We need to deploy men
on the other side of the canyon.

20:41.600 --> 20:44.672
I want to contain this area
and establish a parameter.

20:44.800 --> 20:47.155
It's your call, Abby.
We're here to help.

21:13.600 --> 21:15.079
You all right?

21:15.200 --> 21:18.112
No, l hate those things.
I'm afraid of heights.

21:19.040 --> 21:21.315
I'm Abby Durrell,
l'm the ASAC here.

21:21.440 --> 21:24.318
I'm not sure how much
Harry told you about the...

21:24.440 --> 21:27.512
Tell me what he told you
and we'll take it from there.

21:32.080 --> 21:34.435
The two men were found
a half mile from here.

21:34.560 --> 21:39.156
They were killed with a hatchet,
then gutted in a ritualistic fashion.

21:39.280 --> 21:41.236
Every vital organ was cut.

21:41.360 --> 21:43.669
I got a deputy
talking to the Paiute chief.

21:43.800 --> 21:46.553
There's no Paiute ritual
for gutting a human body.

21:46.680 --> 21:50.355
The dead men were dressed and
quartered the way you'd quarter a deer.

21:50.480 --> 21:51.913
The Paiute are upset...

21:52.040 --> 21:54.759
A Paiute wouldn't quarter
deer hunters unless...

21:54.880 --> 21:56.199
What?

21:56.320 --> 21:58.151
He's gonna eat 'em.

22:00.760 --> 22:04.594
There were two men killed the same way
last week in Washington State.

22:04.720 --> 22:08.713
They were forest service rangers,
which is how we got jurisdiction.

22:08.840 --> 22:10.478
Where are the bodies?

22:10.600 --> 22:12.431
We sent 'em to the lab yesterday.

22:12.560 --> 22:15.358
- You need to see 'em?
- No.

22:30.360 --> 22:34.433
You got too many men and horses here.
All these tracks, it's chaos.

22:34.560 --> 22:38.189
You have a deer stand
or any coolers for packing meat?

22:38.320 --> 22:40.231
Not within a five mile radius.

22:40.360 --> 22:42.555
- No camp site?
- Still looking.

22:44.400 --> 22:47.119
What do you know
about the victims?

22:47.440 --> 22:50.989
As far as we know,
a couple businessmen from Mifnard.

23:00.800 --> 23:03.360
- What else can we do for you?
- Nothing.

23:03.480 --> 23:07.393
- Get everybody to fall back.
- Let's get everybody out of here.

23:07.520 --> 23:10.034
Everybody, let's go.
Let's fall back.

23:10.600 --> 23:12.352
Let's go!

23:14.280 --> 23:16.635
Yeah, everyone!

25:32.200 --> 25:33.918
- This is him.
- Who?

25:34.040 --> 25:35.712
The guy who did it.

25:35.840 --> 25:38.149
We're not sure
how many killers there were.

25:38.280 --> 25:39.759
- One.
- How do you know?

25:39.880 --> 25:42.235
He left his signature on that tree.

25:42.360 --> 25:44.430
The deceased were able-bodied men.

25:44.560 --> 25:47.028
They had rifles
with sophisticated scopes.

25:47.160 --> 25:50.072
One of them had a 9 mm handgun
in his jacket.

25:50.200 --> 25:52.555
It seems unlikely
one man with a hatchet...

25:52.680 --> 25:56.753
He used a knife with a serrated edge
on one side and filet blade on the other.

25:56.880 --> 26:00.429
One guy with a knife threw it
at this tree and killed those hunters?

26:00.560 --> 26:01.913
Yeah.

26:02.040 --> 26:05.919
He wore a size ten shoe with no tread,
like a slipper. Like this one.

26:08.080 --> 26:09.832
He's out there.

26:10.960 --> 26:13.713
- You're not going alone.
- That's the way l work.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.512
- Take this.
- I don't need it.

26:15.640 --> 26:19.633
Humour me. The battery's fully charged.
Please leave it on.

26:19.960 --> 26:20.915
Okay.

26:21.040 --> 26:23.270
- You don't have a gun?
- I don't like guns.

26:23.400 --> 26:27.916
- How much time do we give you?
- If l'm not back in two days, l'm dead.

28:19.640 --> 28:21.232
LT.

28:24.640 --> 28:25.993
Remember me?

28:26.120 --> 28:27.439
No.

28:29.520 --> 28:30.839
You taught me.

28:30.960 --> 28:33.110
I taught a lot of people.

28:40.520 --> 28:42.750
How come you didn't
answer my letters?

28:47.560 --> 28:50.472
How come you chopping up
all these people?

28:50.600 --> 28:52.875
Did you see the scopes
they were using?

28:53.000 --> 28:56.675
They weren't hunters, LT.
They were sweepers.

28:56.800 --> 28:58.870
You're gonna have to come in, son.

31:05.720 --> 31:07.790
Move up.

31:12.160 --> 31:14.116
- He's down.
- Down, he's down!

31:14.240 --> 31:16.435
Don't touch him.
I'm on the weapon.

31:25.560 --> 31:27.551
Bring him in.

32:14.480 --> 32:15.959
LT.

32:17.480 --> 32:19.118
You did a hell of a job.

32:19.240 --> 32:21.435
- He's one of yours?
- Yeah.

32:21.560 --> 32:22.913
He's our man?

32:23.040 --> 32:24.996
- Yeah.
- Any idea why?

32:25.120 --> 32:27.076
No, that'd be your job.

32:31.280 --> 32:32.759
Coffee?

32:33.240 --> 32:35.037
No, thank you, ma'am.

32:35.160 --> 32:37.754
You don't have to talk to us
if you don't want to.

32:37.880 --> 32:39.836
I understand that.

32:40.200 --> 32:43.237
How about telling us your name?
We could start with that.

32:45.440 --> 32:47.192
He knows my name.

32:47.320 --> 32:50.118
Why don't you tell me
what happened in the woods?

32:50.720 --> 32:54.793
Did you know 6 billion chickens
will die in slaughter houses this year?

32:55.560 --> 32:58.358
What does that
have to do with what happened?

32:58.480 --> 33:01.552
What if there was a species
above us in the food chain?

33:01.960 --> 33:06.556
How do you think you'd feel
if that species lost respect for us,

33:06.680 --> 33:08.989
and started slaughtering us wholesale?

33:10.640 --> 33:12.278
I don't know.

33:12.680 --> 33:14.796
But it's very interesting.

33:16.320 --> 33:17.992
Do you understand it?

33:18.120 --> 33:19.712
Oh, yeah.

33:20.280 --> 33:21.713
Good.

33:22.400 --> 33:26.598
What is it you want to tell Mr Bonham
you don't want to tell me?

33:26.920 --> 33:30.196
I'd like to talk to him
about Operation Black Eagle...

33:30.320 --> 33:34.154
Wanna get yourself killed? His name
is Sgt First Class Aaron Hallam.

33:34.280 --> 33:35.713
You remember me.

33:35.840 --> 33:38.991
- They're recording this.
- Good, there'll be a record.

33:39.120 --> 33:40.997
And it'll never say what you want.

33:41.120 --> 33:43.680
Then what am l doing here?

33:43.800 --> 33:47.793
Mort, you've got to help me out here.
Is this our guy or not?

33:48.920 --> 33:53.948
I know. There are always variables.
But we can't indict a variable.

33:54.120 --> 33:55.633
Boss?

33:59.440 --> 34:03.035
We understand you have a man named
Aaron Hallam in your custody?

34:04.280 --> 34:06.953
How much do you know
about Mr Hallam?

34:08.199 --> 34:09.952
Born in 1 968.

34:10.080 --> 34:12.435
Raised in Burl County,
West Virginia.

34:12.560 --> 34:14.596
High school equivalency.

34:14.719 --> 34:18.268
Although he scored
off the charts in science.

34:18.400 --> 34:20.708
Joined the Army at 1 8.

34:21.840 --> 34:23.592
That's the strange part.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.353
What's that, sir?

34:25.480 --> 34:28.040
It doesn't really tell us
any more about him.

34:28.639 --> 34:30.596
The record's incomplete.

34:31.360 --> 34:33.396
Not even a date of discharge.

34:33.520 --> 34:36.751
Sgt Hallam is unofficially listed
as Missing ln Action...

34:36.880 --> 34:37.835
Sir.

34:38.520 --> 34:39.918
Unofficially?

34:40.400 --> 34:42.231
That's a cover.

34:42.360 --> 34:45.112
That means
he's still doing work for you.

34:45.239 --> 34:48.471
We're here to take possession
of your prisoner, sir.

34:49.080 --> 34:51.469
This is not a military base.

34:51.600 --> 34:54.876
Your man very likely killed
and mutilated four hunters

34:55.000 --> 34:56.752
on federal land.

35:00.160 --> 35:03.118
I think you should
take a look at this, sir.

35:05.480 --> 35:10.349
Unless we've been invaded by a foreign
power and are officially at war,

35:11.200 --> 35:13.350
you don't have any authority here.

35:25.240 --> 35:29.472
I know you wanna get out of here,
but we're waiting on the blood results.

35:29.600 --> 35:31.352
Ever use that thing?

35:31.480 --> 35:33.755
- Did l ever shoot anyone?
- Yeah.

35:33.880 --> 35:37.395
- Would you ask a guy that question?
- Yeah.

35:37.520 --> 35:40.717
As a matter of fact, l have.
Do we have to go into it?

35:40.840 --> 35:42.876
- No.
- Okay.

35:55.120 --> 35:57.509
Not a great view of the city.

35:58.440 --> 36:00.431
It's a wilderness.

36:03.960 --> 36:06.076
What's your relationship to Hallam?

36:06.200 --> 36:08.919
- I trained him.
- To do what?

36:09.040 --> 36:12.271
Trained him to survive.
I trained him to kill.

36:14.080 --> 36:17.356
I trained a lot of people like him.
The "best of the best."

36:18.360 --> 36:20.316
I pulled your file.

36:21.200 --> 36:24.317
- You were never in the military.
- No.

36:26.200 --> 36:28.156
- You just work for them?
- Yeah.

36:29.440 --> 36:31.396
- Like a contractor?
- Yeah.

36:32.360 --> 36:34.715
You don't like to talk about it, do you?

36:35.120 --> 36:36.872
No.

36:41.280 --> 36:43.589
My father was an Army colonel.

36:44.440 --> 36:46.635
When my brother
was killed in Vietnam,

36:46.760 --> 36:51.276
he decided we wasn't going to lose
another son to that particular war.

36:51.800 --> 36:54.394
Dad was a tracker
before he joined the Army,

36:54.520 --> 36:56.909
and l learned what l do from him.

37:00.320 --> 37:01.673
What about Hallam?

37:01.800 --> 37:03.950
He's unusual.
He can kill anybody.

37:04.360 --> 37:06.112
Without regret.

37:07.720 --> 37:11.633
Most people he killed never knew
he was in the same room with them.

37:13.400 --> 37:14.992
How'd you feel about that?

37:15.120 --> 37:17.953
I don't know.
I never had to kill anybody myself.

37:22.160 --> 37:24.469
I just taught people how.

37:48.240 --> 37:51.357
In many ways,
H.allam is a fine warrior.

37:51.480 --> 37:56.110
Aftera tourin Kosovo, he was given
anothersensitive assignment.

37:56.240 --> 37:58.117
Offthe books.

38:00.720 --> 38:02.472
H.e went too far.

38:04.080 --> 38:06.799
A lot of innocent people
lost their lives.

38:08.040 --> 38:10.474
Hallam's battle stress
has become so deep

38:10.600 --> 38:12.955
it is a part of his personality.

38:13.080 --> 38:15.196
And it's impossible to reverse.

38:16.280 --> 38:18.475
He's a killing machine.

38:18.600 --> 38:23.390
There is no way he can be indicted,
or tried in open court, or any court.

38:23.520 --> 38:26.353
He cannot be processed,
interviewed,

38:26.480 --> 38:29.358
charged with a crime,
or cocked out as a psycho.

38:29.480 --> 38:31.948
His picture cannot appear
in any newspaper.

38:32.080 --> 38:34.913
As far as the world
is concerned, sir,

38:35.040 --> 38:36.996
Aaron Hallam doesn't exist.

39:10.320 --> 39:12.550
He's one of them.

39:14.800 --> 39:16.472
They'll handle it.

40:08.800 --> 40:11.155
You know why you're here, Aaron.

40:12.120 --> 40:14.759
You wandered off the range.

40:17.520 --> 40:20.956
This is way too messy.
You're supposed to be precise.

40:21.880 --> 40:24.235
They weren't his family.

40:24.360 --> 40:26.237
They were soldiers, Dale.

40:26.360 --> 40:29.158
There was no backup,
no way for me to get out.

40:29.280 --> 40:30.793
I was set up.

40:30.920 --> 40:33.559
That's bullshit.
You fucked up.

40:33.680 --> 40:37.434
Your actions resulted in the injury
and death of unarmed civilians.

40:37.560 --> 40:39.357
They had weapons.

40:41.360 --> 40:43.112
That's the problem.

40:43.840 --> 40:46.718
You can't tell the sharks
from the guppies any more.

41:05.160 --> 41:07.799
That's what they're using now?

41:07.920 --> 41:09.592
Supposed to be painless.

41:09.720 --> 41:11.756
Course, he never used it on himself...

41:13.440 --> 41:15.908
Release him.
Release him now!

41:26.240 --> 41:28.117
- Flying to Vancouver?
- Yeah.

41:28.240 --> 41:29.798
Then a connecting flight?

41:29.920 --> 41:32.115
No. I drive.
Takes about eight hours.

41:32.240 --> 41:35.596
That's right, you don't like flying.
Must be worth it.

41:35.720 --> 41:39.633
It's a special place. You ought to
come up sometime. You'd like it.

41:39.760 --> 41:44.117
You don't have to wear two guns all
the time. Your posture would change.

41:45.920 --> 41:47.558
It's an open invitation.

42:39.120 --> 42:40.997
Is it painless, Dale?

42:44.360 --> 42:47.352
- We need paramedics!
- It's gonna explode!

42:47.480 --> 42:50.358
- See if you can help...
- No, l can't!

42:50.480 --> 42:53.358
Does anyone know
what's going on?

42:53.480 --> 42:55.072
Is anyone on their way?

42:57.160 --> 43:00.357
- Paramedic! Paramedic!
- You all right?

43:01.160 --> 43:04.596
I'm okay, l'm okay!
My buddies are in there.

43:04.720 --> 43:06.597
Get 'em out, get 'em out!

43:06.720 --> 43:08.915
Somebody call an ambulance.

43:11.080 --> 43:12.513
You're okay.

43:23.440 --> 43:25.192
Get 'em out!

43:26.640 --> 43:28.119
Shit!

43:46.640 --> 43:49.234
- You go over there.
- Okay, yeah.

43:51.200 --> 43:52.713
One, two...

43:52.840 --> 43:59.188
three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten.

43:59.320 --> 44:01.470
Ready or not, here l come.

44:42.080 --> 44:44.196
We have a breaking story.

44:44.320 --> 44:46.276
We're going to
ourcorrespondent

44:46.400 --> 44:50.109
who is live outside the tunnel
to Forest Park. Jeff?

44:50.240 --> 44:53.630
We havejust arrived on the
scene ofa terrible accident

44:53.760 --> 44:55.990
outside the tunnel
in Forest Park.

44:56.120 --> 44:58.953
This is some sort ofvan
that was transporting people.

44:59.080 --> 45:00.832
We can tell you there are...

45:11.720 --> 45:14.439
I will teach you how to kill.

45:14.560 --> 45:17.154
Quickly, accurately,
efficiently.

45:18.560 --> 45:21.199
It will become a reflex action.

45:21.320 --> 45:25.438
You will learn how to entera
combat zone and evaporate into shadow.

45:25.560 --> 45:27.437
You will learn
how to survive.

45:27.560 --> 45:29.312
Or you will not.

45:29.440 --> 45:31.431
Ready...

45:31.560 --> 45:32.959
Arm! Hut!

45:35.960 --> 45:37.552
Reverse your grip.

45:37.680 --> 45:39.989
Bring your knife
from the inside of his arm,

45:40.120 --> 45:43.954
sever the connecting tissue, pulling
his finger away from the trigger.

45:44.080 --> 45:46.878
Come around his shoulder,
grab the strap, choke him.

45:47.000 --> 45:51.630
Come into his heart, to the top of his
sternum and bring him to the ground.

45:51.760 --> 45:55.389
Arm throw, heart, leg,
leg, arm, lung. Good.

45:55.520 --> 46:00.913
Slice through that thigh,
into this thigh and that femoral artery.

46:01.040 --> 46:03.156
You'll notice this arm
is in your way.

46:03.280 --> 46:06.033
The only thing this arm
can do to hurt you

46:06.160 --> 46:08.674
is block the lung puncture
you're about to do.

46:08.800 --> 46:11.872
Push this arm over in front of his face.
Go into his lung.

46:12.000 --> 46:15.515
Now, arm, neck,
heart, leg, leg, lung!

46:15.640 --> 46:17.471
One, two, three,
four, five. Six!

46:17.600 --> 46:19.636
One, two...

46:19.760 --> 46:22.228
three,
power assist four,

46:22.360 --> 46:24.555
five, six.

46:24.680 --> 46:26.432
One, two, three,
four, five, six!

46:26.560 --> 46:28.312
...two, three, four,
five, six.

46:28.440 --> 46:30.271
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

46:30.400 --> 46:32.516
Make this cut
a good power assist.

46:32.640 --> 46:35.313
You're looking for his backbone.
Here we go.

46:38.160 --> 46:40.071
Go.

46:40.200 --> 46:42.031
There we go.
Once again.

46:47.880 --> 46:49.791
LT,

46:51.480 --> 46:53.550
I don't think l can do this any more.

46:54.360 --> 46:57.272
The nightmares
are getting worse.

46:58.240 --> 47:00.435
I think l'm losing it, LT.

47:02.040 --> 47:03.871
I need to talk to you.

47:13.680 --> 47:17.958
I don't know ifyou've
been getting my letters, LT.

47:18.080 --> 47:20.355
I need to hearfrom you,
or talk to you.

47:22.440 --> 47:24.476
You've been like
a father to me.

47:24.600 --> 47:26.875
Please write.

47:30.440 --> 47:32.317
Once you are able to
kill mentally,

47:32.440 --> 47:35.557
the physical part
will be easy.

47:35.680 --> 47:38.194
The difficult part...

47:38.320 --> 47:41.392
is learning how to turn it off.

47:45.680 --> 47:48.148
At this point,
all we know for sure

47:48.280 --> 47:50.589
is we have three
confirmed fatalities.

47:50.720 --> 47:53.188
We don't know
if there were other passengers

47:53.320 --> 47:55.390
inside this van
when it crashed.

47:55.520 --> 47:57.954
Access is limited.
We have no new information

47:58.080 --> 48:00.071
from either the police or the FBl.

48:00.200 --> 48:04.034
However, the van appears
to be a military vehicle.

48:04.160 --> 48:06.720
possibly the type used
to transport prisoners.

48:06.840 --> 48:08.751
We'll try to get confirmation.

48:08.880 --> 48:11.189
Once again,
information very sketchy.

48:11.320 --> 48:15.199
Rescue crews still on the scene
along with FBI agents and technicians.

48:15.320 --> 48:18.392
We're getting no comment
from agents on the scene.

48:18.800 --> 48:21.155
- What happened?
- H.allam's loose.

48:37.920 --> 48:39.911
Hello, lrene.

48:40.040 --> 48:41.519
Aaron.

48:41.640 --> 48:43.153
You scared me.

48:43.280 --> 48:44.838
It's good to see you.

48:45.320 --> 48:48.517
I'm not listening to you.
Everything you told me was a lie.

48:48.640 --> 48:50.232
I've never lied to you.

48:50.360 --> 48:52.874
Where have you been
the last six months?

48:53.000 --> 48:56.197
- Doing stuff for the government.
- That's a damn lie!

48:56.320 --> 48:59.118
Get out of here.
I don't want to see you again.

48:59.240 --> 49:01.117
Aaron?

49:03.120 --> 49:05.076
- Aaron, you're back!
- Hey, Loretta.

49:07.520 --> 49:09.750
It's good to see you!
l missed you so much.

49:09.880 --> 49:12.155
- How's my big girl?
- Where have you been?

49:15.000 --> 49:17.230
Loretta, l need you
to do your homework.

49:17.360 --> 49:19.430
Can l visit with Aaron some more?

49:19.560 --> 49:21.357
You can visit later.

49:21.480 --> 49:24.233
- Are you staying for dinner?
- Go do your homework.

49:29.080 --> 49:31.992
Don't think you're just
gonna step back into our lives.

49:32.120 --> 49:33.838
I understand, lrene.

49:33.960 --> 49:36.315
I don't even know
what you do for a living.

49:38.360 --> 49:41.033
Did you look in my locker?

49:41.160 --> 49:42.798
How could l do that?

49:42.920 --> 49:44.956
You got four locks
on that thing.

49:55.480 --> 49:57.232
What track is that?

49:59.560 --> 50:02.120
- A squirrel.
- That's right.

50:02.240 --> 50:03.514
Where is the next one?

50:03.640 --> 50:05.596
- Um...
- Bring it down.

50:05.720 --> 50:07.358
Where's the next one?

50:07.480 --> 50:10.074
- I can't tell.
- Hold it flat.

50:13.200 --> 50:15.111
See? Every nine inches.

50:15.240 --> 50:17.037
That's the gallop pattern.

50:17.160 --> 50:20.789
- Every nine inches.
- Oh, yeah. I see.

50:20.920 --> 50:22.638
- What's this one?
- A racoon.

50:22.760 --> 50:24.990
How come
you never see any?

50:25.120 --> 50:26.917
They hide, to survive.

50:28.040 --> 50:30.349
Men don't respect animals any more.

50:31.720 --> 50:34.871
They run 'em down or
kill 'em any chance they get.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.389
I think that's sad.

50:39.560 --> 50:41.710
That's only Kitty.

50:42.480 --> 50:43.833
Here, Kitty.

50:43.960 --> 50:45.871
You don't want
to bother him now.

50:46.000 --> 50:46.989
Why?

50:47.120 --> 50:48.792
He's hunting, too.

50:48.920 --> 50:51.036
Does he know we're here?

50:51.440 --> 50:53.749
- He knows.
- How?

50:55.680 --> 50:57.511
He can sense it.

51:04.680 --> 51:07.399
She's so happy to see you.

51:08.640 --> 51:10.756
Sit down.

51:20.040 --> 51:21.917
What's this?

51:27.440 --> 51:31.149
You got to leave here.
You got to get out of Portland.

51:31.280 --> 51:32.952
- What?
- You're in danger.

51:33.080 --> 51:35.674
- Why am l in danger?
- You and Loretta.

51:35.800 --> 51:38.792
And they'll come here
and burn this house down.

51:38.920 --> 51:41.275
What are you talking about?

51:43.600 --> 51:46.478
We got visual.

51:47.720 --> 51:50.075
Copy that, stand by.

51:55.560 --> 51:57.073
See you later, Dad!

51:57.200 --> 51:59.316
All right, sweetie.

51:59.440 --> 52:01.237
You wait for me
after school,

52:01.360 --> 52:03.476
I'll be there
to pick you up, okay?

52:03.600 --> 52:06.433
- Is everything okay, Mommy?
- Everything's fine.

52:06.560 --> 52:08.278
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

52:08.400 --> 52:10.550
- See you later, alligator.
- Bye.

52:11.960 --> 52:15.350
- ..approaching.
- Roger that, we got her.

52:18.280 --> 52:20.589
Irene Kravitz? Agent Durrell.

52:20.720 --> 52:23.792
Is that your little girl?
Loretta, is it?

52:23.920 --> 52:25.194
That's right.

52:25.320 --> 52:27.993
- We'd like to talk to you.
- About what?

52:28.120 --> 52:31.999
It's just routine,
but it'd be a lot easier inside.

52:33.200 --> 52:36.909
If you make us come back with a warrant,
it won't be routine any more.

52:39.280 --> 52:41.669
Going somewhere, Mrs Kravitz?

52:41.800 --> 52:45.679
No, l'm just cleaning stuff up,
trying to get organised.

52:45.800 --> 52:49.236
We're looking for a man named
Aaron Hallam. Have you seen him?

52:49.360 --> 52:52.830
- Not for a few months.
- But you know him?

52:52.960 --> 52:55.190
This have to do
with his government work?

52:55.320 --> 52:57.436
When's the last time
you saw him?

52:57.560 --> 53:01.553
I don't remember.
A few months ago, he sort of took off.

53:01.680 --> 53:03.432
That's the way he is.

53:03.560 --> 53:05.516
Is he here, lrene?

53:05.640 --> 53:08.029
What's this about?
What's Aaron done?

53:08.920 --> 53:10.751
Please have a seat, lrene.

53:16.880 --> 53:18.836
Nobody said he's done anything.

53:18.960 --> 53:21.872
FBI wouldn't be here
if he hadn't done something.

53:22.000 --> 53:23.911
When did you and Aaron meet?

53:24.040 --> 53:27.635
Eight months ago, maybe. Stayed here
awhile, then he just took off.

53:27.760 --> 53:30.149
He tell you where he was going?

53:30.280 --> 53:32.111
Is he still here?

53:32.240 --> 53:34.708
I said l ain't seen him in months.

53:34.840 --> 53:37.195
How many times
do l have to say that?

53:37.320 --> 53:39.436
Excuse me, sir.
Where are you going?

53:39.560 --> 53:42.552
You wouldn't be doing him
or your daughter any good.

53:42.720 --> 53:44.631
What do you know
about my daughter?

53:44.760 --> 53:46.398
Don't worry...

53:46.520 --> 53:48.431
We reallyjust want
to talk to you.

53:48.560 --> 53:50.437
That's all we want
to do here.

53:50.560 --> 53:53.393
Just sitting here
having a talk, that's all.

53:53.520 --> 53:55.317
You shouldn't worry.

54:13.240 --> 54:17.358
You want someone around for her.
But you have to look out for her safety.

54:17.480 --> 54:20.199
Is this the right guy
to have around your daughter?

54:20.320 --> 54:22.276
What has Aaron done?

54:23.480 --> 54:25.038
We just want to talk to him.

54:25.160 --> 54:27.037
Did he kill somebody?

55:03.480 --> 55:05.436
Come in.

55:08.680 --> 55:11.148
You care about
these people here, Aaron?

55:12.800 --> 55:15.030
You're gonna get 'em hurt.

55:16.360 --> 55:19.909
- You here to sweep me, LT?
- You know l don't do that.

55:20.040 --> 55:21.917
How do l know that?

55:23.600 --> 55:25.556
They are coming for you.

55:25.680 --> 55:28.638
They've been coming for me
for a long time, LT.

55:32.120 --> 55:34.839
You have to answer
for what you've done.

55:34.960 --> 55:36.916
I have to live with what l've done.

55:39.720 --> 55:41.836
You can say
whatever you want.

55:44.520 --> 55:46.875
I don't trust you, LT.

55:50.880 --> 55:52.711
If you cross this line,

55:54.480 --> 55:56.914
you better be ready to kill me.

56:03.880 --> 56:05.199
Don't move.

56:05.320 --> 56:07.914
Put your hands on your head
and get on the floor.

56:10.240 --> 56:12.356
I said get on the floor. Now!

56:14.040 --> 56:15.632
Get down.

57:49.680 --> 57:51.557
That's his Silver Star.

57:54.040 --> 57:56.793
That is a sketch
l made for a knife.

58:01.160 --> 58:03.515
It's addressed to you.

58:06.040 --> 58:09.316
"LT, those guys you trained
to come and kill me,

58:09.440 --> 58:12.557
they're not soldiers.
They're... robots."

58:15.920 --> 58:19.196
We've got a positive ID
at the river front construction site.

58:19.320 --> 58:21.311
We're headed there, over.

58:21.440 --> 58:23.192
1 0-9 that location.

58:28.840 --> 58:33.152
This is agent-in-charge Van Zandt.
Agent Moret. Site foreman Hank Hooker.

58:33.280 --> 58:35.589
Our guy saw him
pull up near that tunnel.

58:35.720 --> 58:38.154
- How many men work down there?
- Three dozen.

58:38.280 --> 58:40.589
We need an exact count
and blueprints.

58:40.720 --> 58:44.349
This is an overview of the site.
There's four major sections.

58:44.480 --> 58:47.677
He probably went down here
in the red section.

58:47.800 --> 58:51.236
- How far does this thing extend?
- 1 2 square blocks.

58:51.360 --> 58:53.828
We'll cover the red section.
Only our people.

58:53.960 --> 58:56.190
Show me the other three entrances.

59:01.040 --> 59:03.838
He went in there.
There's three other entrances.

59:03.960 --> 59:06.315
Make sure
they're completely blocked off.

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:46.358
FBl. Step away from the column
with your hands up.

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:48.436
Let me see your hands!

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:52.277
7-20, this is number one.

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:56.313
I need backup right now.
Red section, tunnel A.

01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:00.353
Did you hear me? l said,
step away from the column now!

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:03.552
Step away from
the fucking column.

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:33.753
My radio's dead.

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:52.872
Shit.

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:55.152
Jesus Christ.

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:56.349
Bobby!

01:01:57.720 --> 01:01:59.995
Leave it in, don't touch him!

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:03.430
Open his mouth.
Keep pressure on the wound!

01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:07.553
Command post.
We have an agent down.

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:10.114
Sector red, sector red!

01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:18.590
Get me them EMTs now!
ASAP!

01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:20.358
Bobby?

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:22.517
Bobby, listen to me!

01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:31.592
Subject spotted.
East bound, number 2 lane.

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:35.110
- Close off both ends of the bridge.
- Two SWAT teams on their way.

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:43.031
Get everybody off the bridge.

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:41.798
Leave that car!

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.752
Excuse me.

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:23.033
- Get down! Leave this between us.
- Don't get in the way!

01:09:23.319 --> 01:09:25.595
Get everybody down on the floor.

01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:49.671
Get down!

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:52.359
He's on the tower!
Target of opportunity.

01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:55.913
He's on the tower! Fire!

01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:14.475
Cease fire!

01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:16.158
Hold your fire.

01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:12.631
Captain, l need two or three
of your officers on each bridge.

01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:16.230
Sweep the western sea wall,
and shut down the bike paths.

01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:18.794
I need recon teams
on both sides of the river.

01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:21.229
Sniper units to cover
each team's advance.

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:25.035
The currents are strong enough
to carry him and he swims like a fish.

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:26.991
This is our show, Bonham.

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:31.033
How many people you willing to lose?
He will kill as many of you as he can.

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:33.390
Decide now on an acceptable body count.

01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:35.829
- Knock it off.
- You'll get more dead bodies

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:38.599
if you let these guys
declare war on my boy.

01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:40.836
I made him what he is
and l can stop him.

01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:44.953
We've lost two of our people.
Best agents l ever served with.

01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:46.638
Hallam belongs to us.

01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:14.509
If he's alive, he won't come in.

01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:16.918
Right.

01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:38.397
- Hallam!
- Get on the ground!

01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:44.636
God said to Abraham,

01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:46.716
kill me a son.

01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:01.199
# There's a man goin' round

01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:03.231
# Takin' names

01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:05.749
# And he decides who to free

01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:08.030
# And who to blame

01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:12.076
# Everybody won't be treated
all the same

01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:15.276
# There'll be a golden ladder

01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:17.516
# Reaching down

01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:21.709
# When the man comes around

01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:28.716
# The hairs on yourarm will stand up

01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:33.868
# At the terror
in each sip and in each sup

01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:38.476
# Will you partake
