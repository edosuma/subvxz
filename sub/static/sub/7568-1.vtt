00:50.005 --> 00:53.035
So tell me. How was Hawaii?

00:53.512 --> 00:56.572
- It was unbelievable.
- Oh, yeah?

00:57.016 --> 00:59.541
- Well, what happened?
- I met this guy.

00:59.576 --> 01:02.112
It was the best week of my life.

01:02.521 --> 01:05.388
It was just a little
vacation romance.

01:05.524 --> 01:07.389
But he was so sweet.

01:07.526 --> 01:09.858
He took me to all these
cool local places.

01:10.029 --> 01:12.327
We went scuba diving...

01:12.531 --> 01:14.897
- Snorkeling.
- Mountain climbing.

01:15.517 --> 01:17.485
We went cliff diving.

01:19.021 --> 01:21.888
Well, we got a little drunk.

01:22.491 --> 01:24.356
- He gave me...
- A back rub.

01:24.493 --> 01:25.790
We slow danced...

01:25.995 --> 01:27.394
...in the rain.

01:27.496 --> 01:29.589
But it wasn't just about the sex.

01:29.999 --> 01:33.025
He pounded me like a mallard duck.

01:34.003 --> 01:35.937
It ended kind of weird, though.

01:36.005 --> 01:38.269
When I asked for his number,
he said he's...

01:38.507 --> 01:39.769
- Married.
- Gay.

01:40.009 --> 01:42.671
- Entering the priesthood.
- He doesn't believe in phones.

01:43.012 --> 01:46.413
He just kind of ran away.

01:46.515 --> 01:49.006
You know, it was just
a little fling, but...

01:49.018 --> 01:50.508
I won't forget my week...

01:51.020 --> 01:52.419
...with Henry Roth.

01:52.521 --> 01:55.217
- Henry Roth.
- Harry.

01:55.524 --> 01:57.992
Harry Paratesticles.

01:58.027 --> 02:00.125
- Henry Roth.
- Henry Roth.

02:00.160 --> 02:02.224
- Henry Roth.
- Henry Roth.

02:02.531 --> 02:05.762
Henry Roth, why didn't you tell me
you were a secret agent?

02:06.035 --> 02:10.699
I prefer intelligence operative,
and I couldn't tell you until I knew you.

02:11.039 --> 02:13.008
Well, can I call you when I land?

02:13.042 --> 02:16.773
You can call me, but I'll be in Peru.
I said that a little loud.

02:16.808 --> 02:20.504
Come on, that's a 187, code blue.
We got the wolf sleeping at night.

02:21.050 --> 02:25.384
He's slipping his arm in the drawer
and out comes the cookie jar. All clear.

02:26.055 --> 02:27.317
Got it?

02:28.057 --> 02:30.491
Well, maybe when you
get back from Peru.

02:31.060 --> 02:34.086
- I don't think that's an option, Lisa.
- Linda.

02:34.563 --> 02:37.930
I know. I changed your name
for your protection.

02:39.068 --> 02:41.901
We have to go our separate ways now.

02:42.071 --> 02:44.562
Well, goodbye.

02:44.573 --> 02:46.404
Got it! Moving out!

02:50.579 --> 02:54.515
- What the hell is your problem?
- Just keep going, I'll give you $20.

02:54.583 --> 02:58.781
- You got it. How's your balls?
- Killing me. Hit it.

03:13.102 --> 03:15.832
Easy, Honah Lee.

03:16.605 --> 03:19.199
Hey, I'm a person, not a seal.

03:19.608 --> 03:25.103
Well, I am a vet, not a doctor. So just
hold still, or I won't give you a treat.

03:25.114 --> 03:26.979
I know, it's okay.
You see that, kids?

03:27.116 --> 03:30.142
You see what happens
when you play with sharks?

03:30.619 --> 03:34.111
Now, why you gotta spread those lies?
Sharks are like dogs.

03:34.123 --> 03:36.751
They only bite when you
touch their private parts.

03:38.127 --> 03:40.118
That's a good title
for my documentary.

03:40.129 --> 03:44.190
Sharks: They Only Bite When
You Touch Their Private Parts.

03:44.633 --> 03:48.228
Or you could call it,
Sharks: They Tried to Eat My Kidney.

03:48.263 --> 03:51.504
All right, enough already.
You too, Willie.

03:54.143 --> 03:55.701
All of you.

03:56.145 --> 03:57.635
He just cast a spell on us.

03:59.148 --> 04:02.049
All right. Put this on four times
a day for two weeks.

04:02.151 --> 04:05.052
- You can handle that.
- What's wrong with that turtle?

04:05.154 --> 04:07.952
Lung problems because
he smoked too much turtle weed...

04:08.157 --> 04:10.216
...which is bad for you. Right, Ula?

04:10.659 --> 04:13.093
What? I don't smoke weed.

04:13.662 --> 04:18.065
Hey, Honah Lee? How's that hot
wahine nympho from Ohio?

04:18.166 --> 04:20.863
Great. I dropped her off
at the airport this morning.

04:21.170 --> 04:22.636
Come on, I need some details.

04:22.671 --> 04:25.834
You get some booby, some assy,
a pull on your poi-poi? Come on.

04:26.175 --> 04:27.836
Daddy, what's a nympho?

04:28.677 --> 04:32.306
Oh. The nympho
is the state bird of Ohio.

04:34.683 --> 04:36.344
You're the state idiot of Hawaii.

04:36.685 --> 04:39.984
Here you go. Bite the fish,
chew the fish, love the fish. Enjoy.

04:40.189 --> 04:42.987
- You crack me up, kamaaina.
- Oh, yeah?

04:43.022 --> 04:44.090
- One of these days...
- Yeah?

04:44.693 --> 04:47.491
...you'll show one of those
tourists such a good time...

04:47.696 --> 04:49.163
...she'll wanna stay on the island.

04:49.198 --> 04:51.132
Why do you say
mean things like that...

04:51.700 --> 04:54.191
...and why is your foot
on my pillow?

04:55.204 --> 04:58.332
I don't want your ass on it, either.
Get up! Get up!

04:58.707 --> 05:00.174
It could happen.

05:00.209 --> 05:03.076
Then you won't be able to go
on your boat trip to Alaska.

05:03.712 --> 05:10.015
You'll be stuck here, waking up next to
the same old, ugly broad, just like Ula.

05:12.721 --> 05:17.522
- Just kidding, guys.
- About the old part or the ugly part?

05:20.229 --> 05:22.823
Henry, come quickly!
It's Jocko!

05:29.238 --> 05:32.002
Jocko! What's going on
with you, buddy?

05:32.241 --> 05:35.108
Don't be scared.
Everything's gonna be fine.

05:35.244 --> 05:37.610
Just stay calm. All right.

05:37.746 --> 05:41.842
Willie, I don't need you to see this.
Get out of here, now!

05:42.251 --> 05:44.776
Okay, check the temperature
of the pool. Go! Hurry!

05:47.256 --> 05:49.816
What are you doing?
I meant check the thermometer!

05:49.851 --> 05:51.817
Give me a hand. Let's go!

05:52.261 --> 05:54.525
Get me two fish
from the barrel. Now.

05:54.763 --> 05:56.094
- Okay.
- Just hang in there.

05:56.265 --> 05:58.199
- Here.
- It's gonna be all right.

05:58.267 --> 06:01.327
That's a little warm.
Go to the bottom of the barrel, please.

06:08.277 --> 06:10.472
Okay, there. That's good. Thank you.

06:10.779 --> 06:12.246
Come on, buddy, take it. Take it.

06:12.281 --> 06:14.272
- He's not responding!
- I know, Alexa!

06:14.783 --> 06:17.769
Sorry, I smacked you. You needed
the fish-slap to calm down.

06:17.804 --> 06:20.755
- Do you understand? Are you calm?
- Yes. Fish-slap calm me.

06:20.789 --> 06:23.189
I'm gonna try to get him
breathing manually...

06:23.792 --> 06:26.989
...so I need your face next
to his mouth to see if it's working.

06:27.024 --> 06:28.228
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

06:28.797 --> 06:31.163
- One, two, three!
- Nothing, nothing!

06:31.300 --> 06:35.737
All right! Try it again. If it doesn't
work we'll perform a tracheotomy.

06:35.804 --> 06:39.001
We don't wanna do that, so let's
pray this works. One more time.

06:39.308 --> 06:41.333
One, two...

06:50.819 --> 06:52.786
That's a lot of vomit.

06:52.821 --> 06:56.154
This is why I got into
this business.

06:56.325 --> 06:58.418
To save sea animals.

06:58.827 --> 07:00.761
You should go
wash yourself off, okay?

07:01.330 --> 07:04.322
Maybe try some turpentine.
That might take the stink away.

07:06.335 --> 07:08.303
Yeah, high-five is right, buddy.

07:08.837 --> 07:12.637
I knew you were gonna burp,
but the vomit thing was awesome!

07:12.841 --> 07:16.038
That's what she gets for eating
my roast beef sandwich.

07:16.345 --> 07:17.607
Willie, did you see that?

07:38.367 --> 07:41.598
Captain's log:
November 5th, 6: 45 a. m.

07:41.870 --> 07:45.169
I've taken the Sea Serpent for
a trip around the island of Oahu.

07:45.374 --> 07:48.275
It is by far the longest voyage
she has yet undertaken...

07:48.377 --> 07:51.039
...and its completion will signal
that she's ready...

07:51.380 --> 07:53.347
...for our great journey
to Bristol Bay...

07:53.382 --> 07:56.874
...whose unspoiled walrus habitat
will yield an abundance of...

08:04.893 --> 08:06.884
Damn it!

08:07.396 --> 08:09.023
Are you kidding me?

08:28.417 --> 08:30.715
Aloha, honey.
What can I get for you?

08:30.919 --> 08:33.409
I guess I'll take a cup of coffee.

08:33.922 --> 08:36.390
- You guess?
- Yeah, I already ate breakfast.

08:36.424 --> 08:40.121
I need to kill some time before the
Coast Guard gets here to tow my boat.

08:40.429 --> 08:41.691
What did you eat?

08:41.929 --> 08:45.593
I had a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup
and some Gatorade.

08:45.934 --> 08:48.960
They're not breakfast.
I get you Spam and eggs.

08:48.995 --> 08:51.303
Nick, I need Spam and eggs.

08:51.940 --> 08:53.567
Hey.

08:53.942 --> 08:57.207
- You like the peanut butter cups?
- Yes.

08:57.446 --> 08:59.812
Want me to put peanut butter cups
in your eggs?

09:00.949 --> 09:02.280
No, that's okay.

09:03.452 --> 09:05.147
Peanut butter cups.

09:21.970 --> 09:26.270
- Hey, Sue, nice haircut.
- Mahalo, Lucy.

09:58.507 --> 09:59.973
Are you staring at me or her?

10:00.008 --> 10:01.999
Because you're starting
to freak me out.

10:03.011 --> 10:06.412
Settle down and eat your pancakes.

10:10.519 --> 10:13.283
I think she's a local girl.
I wanted to go up to her...

10:13.522 --> 10:16.787
...but I was kind of off my game.
But, man, was she cute, though.

10:16.822 --> 10:19.050
I thought you liked your bitches
from out of state.

10:19.528 --> 10:23.294
Yeah, that's usually my policy.
Make sure I don't get tied down.

10:23.532 --> 10:25.932
Freeze that image right there.

10:26.535 --> 10:30.335
There's the little fella.
Congratulations, Mommy.

10:30.539 --> 10:34.771
Sounds to me like someone
is afraid of commitment.

10:35.043 --> 10:36.510
Let me guess.

10:36.545 --> 10:39.013
Your high school sweetheart
got drunk at party...

10:39.047 --> 10:42.175
...then cheated on you
with whole wrestling team.

10:42.551 --> 10:45.748
Close. Actually, it was my
college girlfriend Tracy.

10:46.054 --> 10:49.022
And it wasn't a wrestling team.
It was her academic advisor.

10:49.057 --> 10:53.084
- Oh, she liked the older man.
- Older women. About 50 years older.

10:53.119 --> 10:55.222
I hope you shot the stupid tramp.

10:55.564 --> 10:57.930
What's with the "tramp"
and the "bitches" talk?

10:58.066 --> 11:01.661
- Are you drunk or something?
- I apologize for nasty talk.

11:02.070 --> 11:05.437
I am grouchy due to lack
of recent physical intimacy.

11:06.074 --> 11:09.441
Shut up, because here comes
one-time-only opportunity.

11:09.578 --> 11:13.446
What I will do now is go into
your office and become naked.

11:15.584 --> 11:17.211
Next move is up to you.

11:18.086 --> 11:20.486
I may not be as limber
as I once was...

11:20.589 --> 11:26.084
...but I make up for it with enthusiasm
and willingness to experiment.

11:27.596 --> 11:30.531
I don't know if you realize,
I'm not into guys.

11:50.118 --> 11:52.085
Hey, Mr. Peanut Butter Cups.

11:52.120 --> 11:54.748
Hey, Mr. Could-Kill-Me-in-One-Punch.
How you doing?

11:55.123 --> 11:57.785
- You're back.
- Couldn't get enough of that Spam.

11:57.820 --> 11:59.719
Fry some up and throw
some eggs on it.

12:00.128 --> 12:01.686
- You got it.
- All right, mahalo.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.428
- Hi, Lucy.
- Hi, Nick.

12:18.146 --> 12:21.115
You know, why don't you try this?

12:24.152 --> 12:26.746
It's kind of a hinge.

12:29.157 --> 12:32.854
- Now, why didn't I think of that?
- Well, you're too close to the project.

12:33.161 --> 12:34.492
Don't be hard on yourself.

12:34.663 --> 12:37.427
Right. Sometimes you need
an outsider's perspective.

12:37.666 --> 12:39.395
Fresh eye never hurts.

12:41.670 --> 12:42.932
I'm Lucy.

12:43.171 --> 12:44.604
Yes. I'm Henry Roth.

12:44.673 --> 12:46.504
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

12:46.675 --> 12:49.735
It's pretty. Keep up the good work.

12:50.679 --> 12:54.979
Wait. I see you're sitting there alone.
Do you wanna come and sit down?

12:55.684 --> 12:59.950
- Sure, that'd be great, if that's all right.
- Okay.

13:03.191 --> 13:07.059
- So are you an architect?
- I am not. I'm in fish.

13:07.195 --> 13:09.162
Oh, that's where the smell
is coming from.

13:09.197 --> 13:11.859
Yeah, yeah, I was feeding
a walrus this morning...

13:12.200 --> 13:16.034
...and I thought I got most of it
off of me, but guess I didn't.

13:16.705 --> 13:19.139
- I love that smell.
- No, you don't.

13:19.207 --> 13:22.540
- Fish don't even like that smell.
- No, I do. My dad's a fisherman.

13:22.711 --> 13:26.647
He and my brother Doug, they go
out to sea for months at a time.

13:27.215 --> 13:30.742
And I miss them so much while they're
gone that when they come back...

13:30.777 --> 13:34.587
...I just hold on to them
for five minutes each.

13:37.225 --> 13:42.492
And they smell just like your hands.
It's the best smell in the world.

13:43.231 --> 13:45.028
Well, my fingers are available...

13:45.233 --> 13:47.963
...for your sniffing pleasure
anytime you need them.

13:48.737 --> 13:50.705
- Wanna?
- Okay.

13:59.748 --> 14:03.650
Sea lions are known
for their athleticism...

14:03.752 --> 14:06.186
...and dolphins are known
for their intelligence.

14:06.755 --> 14:10.724
- Walruses are known for their...
- Tusks?

14:10.759 --> 14:16.698
Their tusks. Also their male parts
can get pretty gigantic.

14:17.766 --> 14:21.429
Yeah, yeah, it's the second biggest
out of all the mammals.

14:22.270 --> 14:25.728
- What's the first?
- I think Tattoo-Face.

14:29.778 --> 14:31.439
I like your laugh.

14:32.280 --> 14:33.747
I like you making me laugh.

14:33.782 --> 14:36.649
I hate to break this up,
but we're setting up for lunch.

14:37.285 --> 14:39.913
Oh, okay. Sorry, Sue.

14:40.789 --> 14:44.156
And the real cool thing about walruses
is they're very mysterious.

14:44.292 --> 14:46.522
- Mysterious?
- Yeah, yeah.

14:46.795 --> 14:49.262
We don't really know what
they're like in the wild.

14:49.297 --> 14:52.528
Don't they just sleep on icebergs
and yawn all the time?

14:52.801 --> 14:55.668
All we really see is what they do
outside of the water...

14:55.804 --> 14:58.329
...but who knows what
they do under the ice...

14:58.807 --> 15:01.105
...where they spend
two-thirds of their lives.

15:01.309 --> 15:06.008
Well, maybe they're intimidating the
other creatures with their big winkies.

15:06.043 --> 15:07.975
That is one theory.

15:09.317 --> 15:11.649
- I have to go.
- Where you going?

15:11.820 --> 15:15.517
It's my dad's birthday, and we go
every year and we pick a pineapple.

15:15.824 --> 15:19.590
- It's a tradition.
- That sounds nice. Okay, well...

15:19.828 --> 15:21.318
...I had a great time.

15:21.329 --> 15:23.422
- Me too.
- Okay.

15:24.332 --> 15:28.132
Would you like to have breakfast
again tomorrow morning, same time?

15:28.336 --> 15:30.736
- Because I teach an art class at 10.
- Really?

15:30.839 --> 15:32.431
- Yeah.
- I wish I could make it...

15:32.466 --> 15:34.365
...but, yes, I will be there.

15:36.344 --> 15:38.005
- Take care.
- Okay.

15:38.346 --> 15:41.509
- One for the road. It is fishy.
- Got you good.

15:41.544 --> 15:42.748
- Aloha.
- Aloha!

15:42.851 --> 15:44.785
See you tomorrow.

15:44.853 --> 15:47.515
Oh, my God.

15:48.356 --> 15:50.950
Oh, my goodness.

16:00.368 --> 16:02.495
Shit.

16:03.872 --> 16:05.999
I had a bee on me.

16:06.374 --> 16:08.706
- All right.
- He was a big one.

16:11.880 --> 16:15.475
Which means
"look at those two shitheads. "

16:22.891 --> 16:25.689
That was the stupidest-looking
swing I've ever seen.

16:25.894 --> 16:28.226
I'm gonna take a Molokai
on that one.

16:28.396 --> 16:30.864
No throwing. Come on.

16:31.399 --> 16:34.061
Stop laughing, you hyenas.
Let's see what you get.

16:34.096 --> 16:36.234
Okay, you heard me. Go! Go!

16:36.404 --> 16:37.996
Show papa what you got.

16:48.917 --> 16:52.978
- You suck, you're good at everything.
- Father of the Year strikes again.

16:53.421 --> 16:58.552
By the way, cuz, I met this sexy, blond
tax attorney at Starbucks today.

16:58.587 --> 17:02.692
I told her you the kahuna
she wanna have fun on this island.

17:02.931 --> 17:04.694
You want her number?

17:04.933 --> 17:06.662
You pimping tourists for me again?

17:06.935 --> 17:09.597
Yes! I live vicariously
through you, remember?

17:09.938 --> 17:10.904
My life sucks.

17:10.939 --> 17:14.170
Now, come on. Give her the Waikikiki
sneaky between the cheeky.

17:15.443 --> 17:19.880
Ula needs it. I imagine I did it and then
I can get through another weekend.

17:19.948 --> 17:22.212
I'm staying in. Sorry.
Thank you, though.

17:22.450 --> 17:24.179
- What?
- Hey, Dad!

17:24.452 --> 17:26.443
Not now, Keanu Mokokokakau.

17:26.454 --> 17:28.012
But your stitches are bleeding.

17:30.458 --> 17:32.221
It must've been my huge back-swing.

17:32.460 --> 17:35.588
You think you can stitch me up
after I get back from surfing?

17:35.964 --> 17:39.491
- Yeah, looking forward to it.
- I wouldn't surf with a wound like that.

17:39.526 --> 17:40.832
You might attract a shark.

17:40.969 --> 17:43.665
What's wrong with that?
Sharks are naturally peaceful.

17:43.972 --> 17:46.964
Is that right?
How'd you get that nasty cut, anyway?

17:46.975 --> 17:48.442
A shark bit me.

17:48.977 --> 17:50.443
Nice.

17:50.478 --> 17:52.503
Go smoke another one, bro.

17:52.981 --> 17:55.176
That shark theory's
starting to catch on.

17:55.211 --> 17:56.746
Now, will everybody keep it down...

17:56.985 --> 17:59.977
...while I whack the crap
out of this thing?

18:05.493 --> 18:07.586
Sit! Stay! Shit! No!

18:13.001 --> 18:15.526
Where the hell is it?

18:16.504 --> 18:17.971
Looking for something?

18:24.012 --> 18:27.504
Oh, my God!
What are you doing here?

18:27.515 --> 18:30.678
The same thing you are.
Looking for my ball.

18:31.519 --> 18:35.387
This is weird. I've been thinking
about you all morning, all day.

18:35.523 --> 18:37.718
Can't wait to have breakfast
with you again.

18:38.026 --> 18:40.995
I know. And I just wanna eat you up.

18:41.029 --> 18:44.465
- Really?
- Yeah. Tomorrow and the next day...

18:44.532 --> 18:47.433
- ... and the next day and the next day.
- All right. Okay.

18:48.536 --> 18:50.003
Oh, my.

18:50.038 --> 18:53.303
Oh, Lucy, that feels so good.

18:53.541 --> 18:57.944
No, my nipples are too sensitive.
Stop that.

19:02.550 --> 19:05.075
- What happened?
- Your ball hooked into that cart...

19:05.553 --> 19:08.920
...bounced back and hit you in
the head. It was freaking hilarious.

19:09.557 --> 19:11.047
- What?
- Who's Lucy?

19:11.059 --> 19:13.823
And what's up with your nipples?

19:15.563 --> 19:19.431
I can't be falling for a local.
I ain't ever going back to that diner.

19:19.567 --> 19:22.331
- This where you got hit?
- Yes!

19:28.576 --> 19:32.034
You're so lucky you're a professional
cliff diver in Hawaii.

19:32.080 --> 19:34.571
- Yeah, well, it's a living.
- I'm a tax attorney.

19:34.582 --> 19:37.278
- We never get to have any fun.
- Is that right?

19:37.585 --> 19:42.921
I'd like to do something
extra fun tonight.

19:51.599 --> 19:54.466
Taking it deep, aren't you?

19:59.607 --> 20:02.058
How about another
fishbowl for the lady?

20:02.093 --> 20:04.510
- Why don't I just tap a keg for her?
- Okay.

20:05.613 --> 20:08.081
I think I'm getting kind of drunk.

20:08.116 --> 20:10.812
- Are you getting drunk?
- Getting there.

20:11.119 --> 20:14.384
So, what are you thinking?

20:18.626 --> 20:20.218
What am I thinking?

20:23.131 --> 20:26.464
Actually, I'm not drunk at all,
Noreen, and neither are you...

20:26.634 --> 20:29.967
...because there's no alcohol
in these drinks.

20:30.638 --> 20:33.129
Sadly, I've used this technique
many times.

20:33.141 --> 20:35.405
It helps lovely tourists,
such as yourself...

20:35.643 --> 20:38.771
...loosen up without impairing
your ability to stay awake...

20:39.147 --> 20:42.173
...and have guilt-free,
vigorous sex with me.

20:43.151 --> 20:44.709
- Wow.
- I'm sorry.

20:45.153 --> 20:48.884
I'm not a cliff diver, either.
I'm afraid of heights.

20:48.919 --> 20:51.648
Well, since it's my last night in town...

20:52.160 --> 20:57.462
...can I pretend you didn't just say that
and still have sex with you anyway?

20:58.166 --> 21:00.794
I can't do it. I'm sorry.

21:01.169 --> 21:04.935
Well, can you at least point me in
the direction of someone who can?

21:05.673 --> 21:08.198
That guy over there
could help you out.

21:11.179 --> 21:13.739
- Isn't that a woman?
- Jeez, I'm not really sure.

21:16.184 --> 21:20.382
But you're too drunk to notice,
remember? Take care.

21:29.697 --> 21:32.188
- Hey, you. Aloha.
- Aloha.

21:32.200 --> 21:36.398
Not aloha, "hello," aloha, "goodbye. "
We're closed today. Go away.

21:36.704 --> 21:38.934
- What are you talking about?
- Order up!

21:39.207 --> 21:42.039
- Don't move. I have to talk to you.
- Okay.

21:42.074 --> 21:44.872
- Hey! Tattoo-Face!
- Hey, Peanut Butter Cups!

21:56.724 --> 21:58.021
Hi.

21:58.726 --> 21:59.954
Hi.

22:00.228 --> 22:03.527
My fingers are extra fishy today,
if you care to take a whiff.

22:04.732 --> 22:05.994
What was that?

22:06.234 --> 22:09.829
I was petting my walrus all morning
and thinking of you the whole time.

22:11.239 --> 22:14.037
Okay, pervert.
I think that you should leave.

22:14.242 --> 22:17.439
What? I was joking because
of what we talked about yesterday.

22:17.745 --> 22:19.713
Yesterday?

22:20.748 --> 22:22.715
I've never even met you.

22:22.750 --> 22:26.345
- Nick! I need help!
- Coming, Lucy.

22:26.754 --> 22:28.619
Nick, put that down.
I'll handle it.

22:28.756 --> 22:32.055
- You, follow me.
- Wait a... What's going on?

22:32.260 --> 22:34.455
I was kidding around with you!

22:35.263 --> 22:38.731
What's happening here?
Is she crazy or something?

22:38.766 --> 22:43.635
Lucy is a very special person.
Very different from other people.

22:44.272 --> 22:45.738
Okay.

22:45.773 --> 22:49.766
About a year ago, Lucy was
in a terrible car accident.

22:50.278 --> 22:53.805
She and her father went up
North Shore to get a pineapple.

23:30.818 --> 23:35.482
Her father broke some ribs, but Lucy
suffered a serious head injury.

23:35.517 --> 23:37.917
She lost her short-term memory.

23:38.826 --> 23:40.521
So she can't remember anything?

23:40.828 --> 23:43.490
No, no, no, she has all of her
long-term memory.

23:43.525 --> 23:45.162
That's a different part
of the brain.

23:45.333 --> 23:49.497
Her whole life, up to the night before
the accident, she remembers.

23:49.837 --> 23:52.601
She just can't retain
any new information.

23:52.840 --> 23:57.504
It's like her slate gets wiped clean
every night while she sleeps.

23:57.845 --> 24:01.144
Hold on. This sounds like something
I would tell a psycho girl...

24:01.179 --> 24:03.442
...so she'd stop calling me.
Am I the psycho girl?

24:03.851 --> 24:05.751
I wish I was making this up!

24:05.853 --> 24:08.617
She has no memory
that she ever met you.

24:08.856 --> 24:10.823
What about the
pineapple-picking thing?

24:10.858 --> 24:13.258
She says that every day,
because each morning...

24:13.861 --> 24:17.160
...she wakes up thinking it's
October 13th of last year.

24:17.365 --> 24:20.664
She comes for breakfast because
that's what she did on Sundays...

24:20.699 --> 24:22.598
...and October 13th
was a Sunday.

24:22.870 --> 24:26.499
She has no idea
it's more than a year later.

24:26.874 --> 24:28.341
She reads the newspaper.

24:28.376 --> 24:31.311
It's a special paper her father
puts on their porch.

24:31.379 --> 24:34.780
It's from the day of her accident.
He got hundreds of them printed.

24:35.383 --> 24:39.979
Lucy does the same thing every day.

24:49.947 --> 24:51.812
- Hello!
- Back here.

24:51.949 --> 24:55.282
- Hi, Dad!
- Oh, hi, sweetie.

24:55.453 --> 24:57.580
You got one without me.

24:58.456 --> 25:01.914
The lady at the farmers' market
gave it to me as a birthday present.

25:01.959 --> 25:04.587
I didn't wanna hurt her feelings.

25:06.464 --> 25:08.261
I think she likes you.

25:08.466 --> 25:11.924
- Yeah, what's not to like?
- What about our tradition?

25:12.470 --> 25:16.497
Well, I have another idea.
I painted my workshop yesterday.

25:16.974 --> 25:18.771
White.

25:19.477 --> 25:21.843
Now it's too white.
Gives me a headache.

25:21.979 --> 25:24.539
Oh, yeah, you definitely
need some color in here.

25:24.574 --> 25:27.474
Well, you know,
that's what I was thinking.

25:27.985 --> 25:29.919
- Really?
- Yeah. Go nuts.

25:29.987 --> 25:33.388
- Paint me something for my birthday.
- I will.

25:33.991 --> 25:37.358
And promise that we can pick
a pineapple for Thanksgiving, okay?

25:37.495 --> 25:40.589
- Sounds great.
- Okay, good.

25:40.998 --> 25:44.331
Hey, you should watch the Vikings
game while I'm painting.

25:45.002 --> 25:46.833
Good idea.

25:51.008 --> 25:54.967
- Yeah, baby. Isolate.
- What are we eating tonight, Doug?

25:55.513 --> 25:58.004
- Spaghetti, Pop.
- Try not to sweat in the sauce.

25:58.516 --> 25:59.949
Sorry, Pop.

26:07.024 --> 26:08.514
Go Vikings.

26:09.527 --> 26:12.826
Seven hundred and five.
Seven hundred and six.

26:13.030 --> 26:15.328
- Seven hundred and seven.
- Hey, you guys.

26:15.533 --> 26:17.626
Hey, sweetie.
How's the painting coming?

26:17.661 --> 26:19.400
- You'll see.
- Cool.

26:19.537 --> 26:22.734
- Oh. What's the score?
- The Vikings are on the two-yard line.

26:23.040 --> 26:26.976
- If they score, they bring it to 14-10.
- Maybe they'll win for your birthday.

26:28.045 --> 26:30.377
And I'll bet Culpepper runs it in.

26:30.548 --> 26:34.814
I'll bet he fakes a handoff to Williams,
throws to Kleinsasser in the end zone.

26:35.052 --> 26:37.782
- Loser does the dishes?
- You're on.

26:37.817 --> 26:39.489
...keep the offense on the field.

26:40.057 --> 26:42.525
Culpepper fakes a handoff
to Williams. He will throw.

26:42.560 --> 26:45.529
He's got Kleinsasser in the end zone!
Touchdown, Minnesota.

26:46.063 --> 26:47.462
Doug, you're good.

26:48.566 --> 26:50.329
Maybe you should be a coach.

26:54.572 --> 26:56.802
- Dad.
- Moron!

26:57.074 --> 26:58.735
That hurt.

27:12.089 --> 27:13.750
And you don't look a day over 25.

27:14.091 --> 27:17.356
Yeah, right, and Doug's muscles
aren't pharmaceutically enhanced.

27:17.391 --> 27:18.755
What? I use an herb supplement...

27:19.096 --> 27:22.429
...that can be purchased at any
health-food store. Check this out.

27:22.600 --> 27:25.398
Check out these glutes.
Rock-hard, baby.

27:25.603 --> 27:26.831
Pretty sweet, huh?

27:27.104 --> 27:29.868
Stop it! You're gonna make me
throw up on the cake.

27:30.107 --> 27:31.574
Okay, just open your present.

27:31.609 --> 27:34.476
Okay. Let's see what we've got here.

27:35.613 --> 27:37.342
The Sixth Sense.

27:38.115 --> 27:41.642
Hey! When I'm done doing the dishes,
do you guys wanna watch it?

27:42.119 --> 27:43.518
- Sure.
- Sure.

27:44.622 --> 27:46.817
Ben Friedkin?

27:47.124 --> 27:50.457
Some people, they call me freak.

27:51.128 --> 27:56.532
- Ronald Sumner?
- I am. I am a freak. Look at me.

27:57.635 --> 27:59.000
Just give me a chance...

28:03.641 --> 28:07.202
I can't believe it.
Bruce Willis is a ghost.

28:07.237 --> 28:09.339
I'm shocked.
Did you see that coming?

28:09.647 --> 28:10.613
- No.
- Not a clue.

28:10.648 --> 28:13.811
- Shocked as hell.
- Anyway, it was awesome.

28:14.151 --> 28:16.085
- Happy birthday.
- Love you, Sis.

28:16.153 --> 28:19.953
Your muscles are getting so big, I can
barely wrap my arms around you.

28:20.157 --> 28:21.920
You like that?
Check this out.

28:26.664 --> 28:30.998
Okay, okay! Enough with the titty
dance! Let your sister go to sleep.

28:31.168 --> 28:33.033
- I like it.
- Sweet dreams, Lucy.

28:33.170 --> 28:35.229
- Good night.
- Good night.

29:25.222 --> 29:26.951
Hey, Tracy, how you doing?

29:27.224 --> 29:28.190
Yeah?

29:28.225 --> 29:31.217
Well, things changed a little bit
since high school.

30:00.758 --> 30:03.591
And this is what happens
every single day.

30:03.761 --> 30:06.286
How long it gonna take for
her memory to come back?

30:06.764 --> 30:09.096
Her doctors say it may
never come back.

30:09.266 --> 30:12.394
So, basically,
what you're saying is...

30:13.270 --> 30:15.568
- ... she's perfect for you.
- What do you mean?

30:15.773 --> 30:18.469
You can hang out all day with
no attachment, because...

30:18.776 --> 30:21.711
Her plane leaves every night?
There's a problem with that.

30:21.779 --> 30:23.440
- What is?
- It's evil.

30:23.475 --> 30:24.508
No, it isn't.

30:24.782 --> 30:28.149
You meet her, hang out, flirt,
no commitment, nobody gets hurt.

30:28.285 --> 30:32.244
- She's got brain damage, you psycho.
- Okay, I'll give you that one.

30:32.790 --> 30:34.621
But I think it'd be healthy for you.

30:34.792 --> 30:37.784
You haven't allowed yourself
to connect with a girl.

30:37.795 --> 30:40.286
I appreciate your interest,
but leave me alone.

30:40.297 --> 30:42.788
Hey, you'd be doing exactly
what her father does:

30:43.300 --> 30:45.131
Giving her a wonderful day.

30:45.302 --> 30:49.398
When it's time for you to go on your
big boat trip, poof, you just leave.

30:49.807 --> 30:51.570
She'll never even know you're gone.

30:51.809 --> 30:55.176
I'm not sure about the "poofing" part,
because I'm not a good poofer.

30:55.312 --> 30:56.779
Demonstrate a good poof for me?

30:56.814 --> 30:59.476
Quit busting my coconuts
for five seconds.

30:59.817 --> 31:03.218
All right. Would you stop poofing
on that joint and do some work?

31:03.821 --> 31:07.621
Okay. Let's get this sucker ready.

31:07.825 --> 31:10.726
Then we're gonna take her
out for a spin.

31:13.330 --> 31:16.298
Captain's log: November 7th.
Nearly midnight.

31:16.333 --> 31:19.029
The Sea Serpent is fully
recovered from her mishap...

31:19.336 --> 31:22.396
...and ready to once again
brave the open ocean.

31:24.842 --> 31:27.606
I think my stitches
opened up again, cuz.

31:27.845 --> 31:31.076
You got a cat?
Because I feel something licking me.

31:42.359 --> 31:43.826
How is it?

31:44.361 --> 31:46.556
Peanut Butter Cups.
What are you doing here?

31:46.591 --> 31:48.729
I just wanted to say hi to Lucy.

31:50.868 --> 31:53.166
I promise you I'm not gonna
do anything wrong.

31:53.370 --> 31:54.598
What did Sue say?

31:54.872 --> 31:58.399
She said that if I talk to Lucy,
you'll kill me with a meat cleaver.

31:58.434 --> 32:01.367
She's the boss, cuz.
But don't worry.

32:01.378 --> 32:03.812
Lucy probably didn't wanna
talk to you anyway.

32:05.883 --> 32:07.850
- What does that mean?
- This ain't a disco.

32:07.885 --> 32:10.820
She doesn't want guys hitting on her
during her breakfast.

32:11.388 --> 32:12.855
She does if it's Henry Roth.

32:12.890 --> 32:14.585
- Who that?
- Who that? Me that.

32:14.892 --> 32:18.851
I bet you 20 bucks I can get her
to have breakfast with me again.

32:21.398 --> 32:23.866
- You're on.
- I love it.

32:24.902 --> 32:28.804
- How you doing, honey?
- Hey, Sue. Nice haircut.

32:28.906 --> 32:31.807
Oh, mahalo.
See you in a bit.

32:31.909 --> 32:35.970
Nick and I have an arrangement.
You can trust me.

32:36.413 --> 32:38.313
Don't worry.

33:00.437 --> 33:02.871
You should try this out.
Put it in there.

33:02.940 --> 33:05.101
Swivelly door.

33:05.442 --> 33:07.842
Waffleonians can
come in and out now.

33:08.946 --> 33:12.143
Are you from a country where it's
okay to stick your fingers...

33:12.178 --> 33:13.541
...all over someone else's food?

33:14.952 --> 33:17.182
No, I'm from this country.

33:17.454 --> 33:19.854
Why? Were you gonna eat that? Oh.

33:19.957 --> 33:22.221
All right, well, have a good meal.

33:27.464 --> 33:29.659
- Yeah.
- That was pathetic.

33:29.967 --> 33:32.026
Yeah? Why don't you choke
on your Spam?

33:32.469 --> 33:34.403
Double or nothing tomorrow.

33:41.979 --> 33:44.277
Hey. I'm sorry to bother you...

33:44.481 --> 33:47.348
...but you look like a person
who appreciates fine art...

33:47.484 --> 33:49.213
...so I wanted your opinion.

33:49.486 --> 33:55.948
I drew this. It's a picture of a father
and son fishing off a fishing boat.

33:55.993 --> 33:57.654
There's a walrus right there...

34:03.000 --> 34:06.026
Oh, you don't speak English. Okay.

34:09.005 --> 34:11.531
Doesn't look Chinese.

34:11.565 --> 34:13.635
Forty.

34:15.512 --> 34:16.877
Can I have that?

34:17.014 --> 34:19.847
I need something
to wipe my ass with.

34:20.016 --> 34:21.348
Shut up.

34:46.543 --> 34:48.476
I wonder what's the matter with him.

34:49.045 --> 34:51.571
Looks like a stupid asshole to me.

34:58.555 --> 35:01.149
Excuse me. Okay.
I didn't mean to startle you.

35:01.184 --> 35:03.083
- No, that's all right. I...
- Are you okay?

35:03.560 --> 35:06.358
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm having
a problem with something...

35:06.563 --> 35:08.428
Something that I could help you with?

35:08.565 --> 35:10.362
No, no, no. I just...

35:10.567 --> 35:13.502
...can't read.

35:14.571 --> 35:16.538
You gotta be kidding me.

35:16.573 --> 35:18.598
- I can read that for you.
- No. Thank you.

35:19.076 --> 35:20.839
I can do this on my own.

35:21.078 --> 35:23.045
Appreciate the sentiment.

35:23.080 --> 35:25.674
I'm gonna get an order of the...

35:36.593 --> 35:37.719
Pan...

35:38.095 --> 35:39.756
Pan...

35:42.099 --> 35:43.412
Panku...

35:43.447 --> 35:44.726
Ca...

35:45.102 --> 35:46.660
Panclocks.

35:47.104 --> 35:49.766
- Pancakes.
- Okay, I'll have pancake.

35:50.107 --> 35:52.473
- Pancakes.
- Pancah... Pancakes! Pancakes!

35:52.609 --> 35:55.208
- I'm so stupid!
- Oh, don't cry.

35:55.243 --> 35:57.808
- Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.
- Don't cry.

35:58.115 --> 36:00.879
- I don't know anything!
- What a loser.

36:04.621 --> 36:06.919
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you sit with me?

36:07.124 --> 36:10.651
You can have some breakfast and
I'll help teach you some of the words.

36:11.128 --> 36:12.925
- Okay.
- All right.

36:13.130 --> 36:15.030
- That sounds nice.
- Come on over.

36:15.132 --> 36:17.157
- Okay, thank you.
- All right.

36:23.140 --> 36:26.473
So I comes before the E?

36:26.643 --> 36:28.941
- Except after C?
- Yes.

36:29.146 --> 36:31.944
Okay, and C is that little
half a squiggly one, right?

36:32.149 --> 36:34.276
- Yes.
- I think I'm getting it.

36:34.651 --> 36:38.143
- How'd you get so good at teaching?
- I'm a teacher. I do it all the time.

36:38.155 --> 36:40.953
I'm an art teacher at
the Haluki-liki Junior High.

36:41.158 --> 36:45.219
Well, you Haluki-liki the kind of
teacher all the kids have crushes on.

36:45.662 --> 36:48.153
I know I would if I was in your class.

36:51.668 --> 36:53.499
Okay.

36:53.670 --> 36:56.298
Oh, boy, do my...
My fingers smell like fish.

36:56.673 --> 36:58.504
That doesn't gross you out, does it?

36:58.675 --> 37:00.438
No, not at all.

37:00.677 --> 37:02.508
Really?

37:05.182 --> 37:08.208
If Lucy gets hurt, I'm gonna chop you
with the meat cleaver.

37:08.243 --> 37:09.777
Okay, okay.

37:11.688 --> 37:13.315
So I had a nice time.

37:13.690 --> 37:15.806
- Yeah, me too.
- Thank you very much.

37:15.841 --> 37:17.922
- Let me get it for you.
- Thank you.

37:18.195 --> 37:19.753
Sure.

37:20.197 --> 37:21.994
Okay.

37:28.705 --> 37:33.699
I just want to eat you up, tomorrow
and the next day, next day, next day...

37:35.212 --> 37:37.146
I'll see you around.

37:37.214 --> 37:38.909
Okay.

37:42.719 --> 37:44.152
Really? That's it?

37:44.721 --> 37:47.952
- That's what?
- All that flirting...

37:48.225 --> 37:51.683
...and phony "I can't read" stuff,
and you're not gonna ask me out...

37:51.728 --> 37:53.059
...or for my phone number?

37:53.230 --> 37:55.528
- I can't read.
- Oh, shut up.

37:55.732 --> 37:59.065
That was one of the goofiest things
I've ever seen, but I thought:

37:59.236 --> 38:02.069
"Hey, if this guy is so desperate
to meet me...

38:02.239 --> 38:04.605
...he might be worth talking to. "

38:04.741 --> 38:06.538
But then I get stiffed.

38:06.743 --> 38:08.904
No, no, no,
this is what happened. I...

38:09.746 --> 38:12.078
Mahalo for the ego boost.

38:12.249 --> 38:15.343
- You're right. You're right. I feel like...
- No worries.

38:15.752 --> 38:17.777
I gotta...
I can read a little!

38:18.255 --> 38:21.713
I didn't know I came before E!
That one I didn't know, I swear.

38:21.758 --> 38:23.589
Oh, you idiot.

38:23.760 --> 38:25.921
I hope you're happy, Shamu.

38:30.267 --> 38:31.791
Marlin. It's Sue.

38:44.281 --> 38:48.445
- Oh, aloha, sir. My name's Henry...
- I know who you are.

38:50.287 --> 38:53.256
- I want to apologize to your daughter.
- Not gonna happen.

38:53.290 --> 38:55.781
She's inside.
We're gonna straighten things out.

38:55.792 --> 38:59.091
Dad, the damn mongoose
got in the garbage again!

39:01.298 --> 39:03.289
- Is this the guy?
- Yeah.

39:03.300 --> 39:06.064
Mr. Roth, I have one simple request:

39:06.303 --> 39:07.930
Stay away from my daughter.

39:08.305 --> 39:11.866
Absolutely. I hurt her feelings
and don't want it to end like that.

39:11.901 --> 39:13.105
It's gonna end like this.

39:14.311 --> 39:15.801
Calm down, little fellow.

39:16.313 --> 39:19.544
I'm gonna kill you! You're a dead man.
Okay, I'm calm.

39:19.816 --> 39:21.408
I'm calm.

39:21.818 --> 39:24.150
- Let me help you up.
- I got it! I got it.

39:24.321 --> 39:28.815
It's just Dad and I work too hard
to protect Lucy to let some idiot ruin it.

39:28.825 --> 39:31.293
I know what you guys do
and I totally respect that.

39:31.328 --> 39:35.059
If you know her condition, you know
she can't have a normal relationship.

39:35.332 --> 39:37.459
The next morning,
she won't know who he is.

39:37.834 --> 39:39.927
And any guy who's okay with that...

39:39.962 --> 39:41.326
...ain't okay with me.

39:41.838 --> 39:45.797
- I'm not looking for a one-night stand.
- Anything with Lucy is, numb-nuts.

39:45.842 --> 39:49.505
Give us a break.
Just stay away from the Hukilau Cafe.

39:50.347 --> 39:52.315
My daughter's been through enough.

39:53.850 --> 39:55.511
Okay. I'm sorry.

40:00.357 --> 40:03.554
I could have whooped his ass,
but this gravel, I slipped on it...

40:03.860 --> 40:06.761
Yeah, well, maybe you need to do
a few more butt flexes.

40:07.364 --> 40:08.831
Cheap shot, Dad.

40:09.866 --> 40:11.333
So fresh and so clean.

40:11.368 --> 40:14.462
Hey, Alexa, did you hook up
with that girl from the bar?

40:14.871 --> 40:16.838
- I chickened out.
- Really?

40:16.873 --> 40:19.865
Yeah, I don't know.
I guess I prefer sausage to taco.

40:21.378 --> 40:24.062
- What?
- Yeah. No, I agree, buddy.

40:24.097 --> 40:26.747
Get out of here.
Run for the hills.

40:27.884 --> 40:29.681
Let me ask you something, Alexa.

40:29.886 --> 40:32.878
If you promised a girl's dad
that you wouldn't see her...

40:32.889 --> 40:35.187
...would you consider that
a binding promise?

40:35.392 --> 40:36.858
- Absolutely.
- Yeah?

40:36.893 --> 40:39.589
Then again, there are always ways
around such things.

40:39.896 --> 40:41.659
- Like?
- For example...

40:41.898 --> 40:46.164
...if I promised a woman's father
I would not see her...

40:46.403 --> 40:50.271
...I would simply shut my eyes
while she serviced my manhood.

40:52.409 --> 40:54.502
That's actually a cool way to look at it.

40:54.537 --> 40:56.208
And a very gross way.

41:12.429 --> 41:15.364
He asked me not to go to the Hukilau.
I'm not going there.

41:15.932 --> 41:17.490
I'm not doing anything wrong.

41:24.441 --> 41:26.636
Sorry to bother you.
I'm kind of stuck here.

41:27.944 --> 41:30.913
- Car trouble?
- Yeah. You mind giving me a jump?

41:31.448 --> 41:32.881
Okay.

41:32.949 --> 41:34.610
Appreciate your time.

41:34.951 --> 41:36.646
Not everybody would have stopped.

41:36.953 --> 41:38.978
- You're real sweet.
- Oh, yeah. Thank you.

41:44.961 --> 41:47.452
I can't believe you fell for that.

41:48.465 --> 41:51.559
Well, my grandfather died
trying to jump-start a car.

41:55.972 --> 41:58.964
I'm sorry.
I was just joking around.

41:58.975 --> 42:02.376
I can't believe you fell for that!

42:02.479 --> 42:04.174
Oh, my God.

42:04.481 --> 42:05.947
That was very good.

42:05.982 --> 42:08.143
- My name's Henry.
- I'm Lucy.

42:08.485 --> 42:10.612
Nice to meet you.
You look like a nice...

42:16.493 --> 42:19.826
Hi. Sorry for the delay.
Should be a few minutes.

42:19.996 --> 42:22.464
- No problem. No worries.
- Where you coming from?

42:22.999 --> 42:24.626
Breakfast?

42:25.001 --> 42:26.434
- Yeah.
- How was it?

42:26.503 --> 42:28.300
I had waffles. They were delicious.

42:28.505 --> 42:30.871
I like making little houses
out of waffles.

42:32.509 --> 42:35.342
- You do?
- That's my thing.

42:37.514 --> 42:38.879
- What's your name?
- Lucy.

42:39.015 --> 42:40.346
Hi, I'm Henry.

42:40.517 --> 42:43.509
Okay, pal. When she stops,
just let her pet you. Look cute.

42:44.020 --> 42:47.183
Go to the middle of the road.
Thank you. Right there. Perfect.

42:53.530 --> 42:56.397
- Oh, shit.
- Here she comes. Smile.

42:59.536 --> 43:01.060
Where is she?

43:04.541 --> 43:06.406
Oh, my God. Oh, no!

43:08.545 --> 43:10.410
Okay. That didn't work.

43:10.547 --> 43:13.414
Shit your pants? So did I.

43:19.055 --> 43:21.023
Okay, this is her.
Start beating me up.

43:21.057 --> 43:22.718
Make it look good.

43:26.062 --> 43:27.689
Give me your wallet!

43:28.064 --> 43:31.158
Okay, haole, what do you think?
You can come to this island...

43:31.568 --> 43:34.469
- ... eat our pineapple...
- Help me! Not so hard.

43:34.571 --> 43:36.704
- Take it easy.
- Try to bang our women.

43:36.739 --> 43:38.837
Making my sister
clean your hotel room.

43:39.075 --> 43:41.373
Okay. What's that have to do
with this? Relax.

43:41.578 --> 43:44.069
- Hey! Hey! Help me, please!
- Stupid haole!

43:45.081 --> 43:48.278
Yeah, that's right. Take that!
And that! And that!

43:48.585 --> 43:50.052
And that! And that!

43:50.086 --> 43:52.350
You got him. You got him.
Enough. Enough.

43:52.589 --> 43:53.886
- Are you okay?
- Yes, yes...

43:54.090 --> 43:55.580
Okay, I'll be back.
Come here!

43:56.092 --> 43:57.719
No, no! I think he's had enough.

43:58.595 --> 44:00.153
I'm sorry.

44:01.097 --> 44:03.327
My eye!

44:04.601 --> 44:06.831
- You got him!
- Not good enough!

44:07.103 --> 44:08.069
Oh, Kamehameha!

44:08.104 --> 44:10.163
He learned his lesson!

44:10.607 --> 44:12.666
- What's your name?
- My name's Henry.

44:13.109 --> 44:14.940
- You did good.
- Hi. Sorry.

44:15.111 --> 44:16.840
I'm in a community-watch program...

44:17.113 --> 44:18.995
Oh, you crazy bitch!

44:19.030 --> 44:20.878
Yeah, keep running!

44:21.117 --> 44:23.517
Okay, okay, he's... He's gone now.

44:30.126 --> 44:31.957
Not her. False alarm.

44:36.132 --> 44:39.226
Don't worry, I called the cops already.
I'm all set.

44:39.261 --> 44:41.729
Yeah? You all set for this, Mr. Smarty?

44:44.641 --> 44:46.575
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah.

44:46.643 --> 44:50.170
When you're finished playing your
kidnap-victim crap on my daughter...

44:50.205 --> 44:51.374
...come by the house.

44:51.648 --> 44:53.741
Okay.

45:01.658 --> 45:03.182
Oh, boy.

45:10.667 --> 45:12.430
There's something I wanna show you.

45:22.679 --> 45:25.773
We figured it out. She only sings
on days she meets you.

45:26.182 --> 45:28.150
You're kidding me. That song?

45:28.184 --> 45:29.617
That's Mom and Dad's song.

45:29.686 --> 45:32.712
When her mom was alive,
Lucy would have me take that tape...

45:33.189 --> 45:35.606
- ... on every fishing trip I went on.
- Oh, yeah?

45:35.641 --> 45:38.024
Yeah, she knew it would make me
miss her mom...

45:38.194 --> 45:39.957
...and want to come home sooner.

45:40.196 --> 45:44.360
I'm seeing a new side to you, sir.
I gotta tell you, it's grossing me out.

45:46.202 --> 45:47.533
Let me ask you something.

45:47.704 --> 45:50.935
What's in it for you?
What do you get out of this?

45:52.709 --> 45:54.040
I don't know.

45:59.215 --> 46:01.740
Wouldn't you want to spend
an hour a day with that?

46:01.775 --> 46:04.551
Actually, no. She sings like shit.

46:05.221 --> 46:07.689
- What?
- Can I ask you guys something?

46:07.724 --> 46:10.557
What'll happen down the line?
Someday she'll wake up...

46:10.727 --> 46:13.924
...look in the mirror and notice
she aged 10 years overnight.

46:14.230 --> 46:16.197
You know something, Henry?

46:16.232 --> 46:19.030
I worry about that
every damn day of my life.

46:24.240 --> 46:25.730
Pardon me.

46:25.742 --> 46:28.836
Sorry to interrupt, but I noticed we
were both eating alone...

46:29.245 --> 46:32.703
...and I thought I could sit with you,
maybe build a syrup Jacuzzi...

46:32.749 --> 46:35.980
- ... for your waffle house?
- Oh, that would be nice...

46:36.252 --> 46:38.550
...but I have a boyfriend.

46:38.755 --> 46:40.780
So I'm sorry.

46:42.759 --> 46:45.125
You're making up a boyfriend
to get rid of me?

46:45.261 --> 46:46.660
No, I'm not.

46:46.763 --> 46:48.856
What's his name, then?

46:48.891 --> 46:50.027
Ringo.

46:50.767 --> 46:52.325
Is his last name Starr?

46:52.769 --> 46:55.761
- No. McCartney.
- McCartney, okay.

46:56.272 --> 46:58.103
- Oh, no.
- All right. I'm sorry.

46:58.274 --> 47:00.674
No! This cop is writing me a ticket!

47:01.277 --> 47:03.268
Oh, whoa, whoa.
I wouldn't go out there.

47:03.279 --> 47:04.678
- Wait, wait, wait!
- Go on!

47:04.781 --> 47:06.146
I'm coming.

47:06.282 --> 47:08.273
The tags don't expire
for seven months.

47:08.284 --> 47:11.082
- They expired May of this year.
- No! No, no!

47:11.287 --> 47:12.754
They expire May of next year.

47:13.289 --> 47:15.280
I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

47:15.291 --> 47:17.020
- I don't.
- This is ridiculous.

47:17.293 --> 47:19.523
I'm not paying for this!
It's October!

47:19.796 --> 47:22.264
Excuse me. Can I borrow this?
Look, October!

47:22.298 --> 47:24.163
Lucy, let's go back inside.

47:25.301 --> 47:27.030
What?

47:36.813 --> 47:38.303
What?

47:44.821 --> 47:46.948
Having a bad day, Doug!

48:28.364 --> 48:30.127
Sweetheart...

48:30.867 --> 48:32.630
...these are from the accident.

48:49.886 --> 48:52.616
Oh, no!

48:59.896 --> 49:02.296
I can feel it.

49:04.400 --> 49:07.927
You were in the hospital
for three months, sweetheart.

49:20.917 --> 49:25.115
I have to talk to this doctor.
I need to hear it from him.

49:25.421 --> 49:27.412
You have heard it, sweetie.
Many times.

49:29.425 --> 49:30.824
I have?

49:32.428 --> 49:33.986
I'll take her.

49:35.431 --> 49:38.093
I have to hear for myself too.

49:48.945 --> 49:51.140
Doug, just take this, okay?
I can't...

49:51.175 --> 49:53.609
I can't look at it anymore.

49:54.450 --> 49:58.079
- It's gonna be all right, Luce.
- Don't call me Luce. I barely know you.

49:58.454 --> 50:00.684
Sweetie, you're sort of dating him.

50:01.958 --> 50:04.324
Sorry I'm not better-looking.

50:06.462 --> 50:09.090
What else happened
since last October?

50:09.465 --> 50:13.265
- What about my students?
- Miss Campbell took over your class.

50:15.972 --> 50:18.907
- Did Alicia marry that guy?
- Yeah.

50:18.975 --> 50:21.341
Doug, did you win
the Mr. Hawaii contest?

50:21.477 --> 50:23.775
I didn't know there was gonna be
a urine test.

50:24.480 --> 50:25.708
Wow.

50:26.983 --> 50:28.348
Do we have sex?

50:29.986 --> 50:33.854
No, we don't.
Just so everybody knows that.

50:34.991 --> 50:36.219
We want to.

50:37.493 --> 50:39.188
Just kidding.

50:42.999 --> 50:46.696
So you guys have to just lie
to me every day.

51:00.516 --> 51:02.643
Hey, Lucy.
Good to see you again.

51:05.521 --> 51:07.614
What the hell's her problem?

51:08.024 --> 51:10.549
She doesn't remember
who you are, brah.

51:10.584 --> 51:12.391
Oh, yeah.

51:12.528 --> 51:15.292
I suck at this job.

51:17.033 --> 51:18.967
Lucy, these are your
brain scans here.

51:19.035 --> 51:21.281
I'm afraid they show
no improvement.

51:21.316 --> 51:23.528
The temporal lobe
was severely damaged.

51:24.040 --> 51:27.008
What we believe is scar tissue
here is impairing your ability...

51:27.043 --> 51:30.706
...to convert short-term memory into
long-term memory while you sleep.

51:31.047 --> 51:33.811
The condition's come to be known
as Goldfield Syndrome.

51:34.050 --> 51:37.247
- Who's Goldfield?
- A brilliant Lithuanian psychiatrist.

51:37.553 --> 51:39.520
He himself suffered
temporal-lobe damage.

51:39.555 --> 51:41.648
Took him four years
to publish his findings...

51:42.058 --> 51:44.720
...because he had to keep
starting over from scratch.

51:45.061 --> 51:48.428
Obviously, your sense of humor
is still intact, and that's here.

51:48.564 --> 51:50.327
Magnificent amygdala as well.

51:50.566 --> 51:53.467
- Doctor, I have a question.
- I'd be happy to answer it...

51:53.569 --> 51:57.972
...but as I've told you before, this is a
hygienic facility. Shirts are required.

51:58.074 --> 51:59.507
- Oh, okay.
- Nice move.

52:01.577 --> 52:03.272
Listen, doctor, this...

52:03.579 --> 52:07.208
...friend of mine's been experimenting
a little with steroids.

52:07.243 --> 52:08.948
He's been having a lot
of wet dreams.

52:09.585 --> 52:11.610
Could there be a connection
between them?

52:11.645 --> 52:13.418
Douglas, get off the juice.

52:13.589 --> 52:16.615
As for the nocturnal emissions,
why don't you take a swim...

52:17.093 --> 52:20.961
...buy a shirt with no holes,
find a wahine and take her to dinner.

52:21.097 --> 52:23.292
I'll tell my friend you said so.

52:24.100 --> 52:26.830
In any case, Lucy,
your condition is stable...

52:27.103 --> 52:28.695
...but most likely permanent.

52:29.105 --> 52:31.039
I'm so sorry, dear.

52:31.107 --> 52:32.802
But it could be worse.

52:34.610 --> 52:35.975
Yeah? How?

52:36.112 --> 52:38.945
I think you should meet
Ten Second Tom.

52:39.031 --> 52:42.762
Callahan Institute is the leading
brain-injury clinic in the Pacific Rim.

52:43.119 --> 52:46.384
We are funded out of Sandusky, Ohio
by T.B. Callahan...

52:46.622 --> 52:49.887
...the automotive-components tycoon
and philanthropist.

52:54.630 --> 52:57.155
And now, I would like
to introduce to you...

52:57.633 --> 53:00.466
...our most distinguished
clinical subject...

53:00.636 --> 53:02.035
...Tom.

53:02.138 --> 53:03.730
- Hi. I'm Tom.
- Henry.

53:03.765 --> 53:04.867
- Marlin.
- Doug.

53:05.141 --> 53:06.369
- Lucy.
- Hi.

53:06.642 --> 53:08.803
Cool flip-flops.
Where'd you get them?

53:09.145 --> 53:12.171
You like those? It's interesting.
I was on the North Shore...

53:12.206 --> 53:13.376
Hi, I'm Tom.

53:14.150 --> 53:16.118
- Henry.
- Hi.

53:16.152 --> 53:18.143
- Marlin.
- Tom lost part of his brain...

53:18.654 --> 53:21.350
...in a hunting accident.
His memory lasts 10 seconds.

53:21.657 --> 53:23.124
I was in an accident? That's terrible.

53:23.159 --> 53:25.286
Don't worry.
You'll get over it in seconds.

53:25.661 --> 53:29.119
Get over it? I mean, what happened?
Did I get shot in the brain...?

53:29.165 --> 53:31.395
- Hi, I'm Tom.
- Hi, I'm Lucy.

53:31.667 --> 53:32.929
- Hi.
- Doug.

53:33.169 --> 53:34.397
- Hey.
- Marlin.

53:34.670 --> 53:37.195
Hey, Tom, can I tell you a secret?

53:39.675 --> 53:42.735
Don't you think you're a little old
to still have wet dreams?

53:46.182 --> 53:49.015
- They liked that.
- Hi, I'm Tom.

53:49.185 --> 53:51.517
- Yeah, watch yourself, Tom.
- Easy.

54:05.701 --> 54:08.101
- I'm gonna go to sleep.
- All right. Good night.

54:08.204 --> 54:10.798
Good night, you guys.
I'll see you tomorrow.

54:12.708 --> 54:15.302
- And I guess I'll see you too?
- Oh, yeah.

54:15.711 --> 54:17.770
You had a rough day today.
I'm sorry.

54:17.805 --> 54:19.908
I hope you get some rest tonight.

54:20.716 --> 54:22.183
Okay.

54:22.218 --> 54:23.685
Good night.

54:24.220 --> 54:25.482
So how you getting home?

54:25.721 --> 54:27.814
- You gonna take the Likelike or...
- Hey.

54:30.226 --> 54:32.956
Thank you for being
so nice to me today.

54:33.229 --> 54:35.789
- Sure.
- I don't want you to...

54:35.824 --> 54:37.426
...strike out tomorrow.

54:37.733 --> 54:39.598
So maybe you could talk
to me about...

54:40.236 --> 54:41.498
...lilies.

54:41.737 --> 54:42.965
Lilies?

54:43.239 --> 54:44.968
I'm a sucker for lilies.

54:45.241 --> 54:46.868
Thanks for the tip.

54:47.243 --> 54:50.075
Good night.

54:50.746 --> 54:52.713
My, oh, my.

54:52.748 --> 54:54.739
- Lover-boy.
- Yes, sir.

54:55.251 --> 54:57.446
You don't have to rush off.
Stick around.

54:57.753 --> 55:00.221
You've earned yourself
a couple beers.

55:01.757 --> 55:03.884
So what'll you do when
you finish the boat?

55:03.919 --> 55:05.624
Actually, I'm going on a trip soon...

55:05.761 --> 55:08.161
...to study undersea
Pacific walrus behaviors.

55:08.264 --> 55:09.595
Sounds kind of fruity.

55:09.765 --> 55:11.995
- Thank you.
- How long is it gonna take?

55:12.268 --> 55:13.496
About a year.

55:13.769 --> 55:15.600
Guess you won't miss days like this.

55:16.272 --> 55:18.968
Well, maybe days like this
don't have to be so bad.

55:19.275 --> 55:21.106
What are you trying to say?

55:22.278 --> 55:23.643
When you guys tell her...

55:23.779 --> 55:26.697
...she's not just finding out
about the accident.

55:26.732 --> 55:29.615
She's finding out that her life
is basically a setup.

55:29.785 --> 55:31.753
I think that freaks her out the most.

55:31.787 --> 55:33.186
- You're an expert now?
- No.

55:33.789 --> 55:36.223
I'm saying I wish there was
another way besides:

55:36.292 --> 55:39.989
"Sorry we couldn't trick you today.
Here's pictures of your broken head. "

55:40.296 --> 55:42.662
- You want a broken head?
- You'll give him one?

55:42.798 --> 55:44.959
No, Daddy, I thought
you was gonna do it.

55:45.301 --> 55:48.065
Nobody's gotta break my head.
I'm gonna split anyways.

55:48.304 --> 55:50.771
Oh, don't go just because
my son is psychotic.

55:50.806 --> 55:54.105
Good night. Sweet dreams.
Keep them dry there, Doug.

55:54.810 --> 55:56.607
Very funny.

56:17.833 --> 56:20.495
- Excuse me. Lucy Whitmore?
- Yes?

56:20.530 --> 56:22.736
I have a delivery for you.

56:23.339 --> 56:25.500
- A delivery for me?
- Yes.

56:27.343 --> 56:30.141
Oh, they're beautiful.

56:30.846 --> 56:33.246
- Who are they from?
- That I can't tell you.

56:33.349 --> 56:36.978
It's a secret admirer.
He also wants you to have this.

56:37.353 --> 56:40.686
- Who's your friend, Lucy?
- Oh, well, I mean, I don't know.

56:40.856 --> 56:43.154
We just met, but look.

56:43.359 --> 56:45.190
I have a secret admirer.

56:45.361 --> 56:47.989
Oh, really? What's this?

56:48.364 --> 56:49.854
It's a videotape.

56:50.366 --> 56:51.833
A videotape of what?

56:51.867 --> 56:54.028
I have no idea.

56:54.370 --> 56:56.167
But I have to find out.

56:57.373 --> 56:58.863
Happy birthday, Daddy.

56:58.874 --> 57:01.900
- Thank you, sweetie.
- That's right. Happy birthday, sir.

57:01.935 --> 57:03.811
- What are you, 200 today?
- That's cute.

57:04.380 --> 57:07.406
- What are you doing?
- I wanted to try something different.

57:07.441 --> 57:09.817
If it doesn't work,
we've only wasted one day.

57:29.405 --> 57:31.168
Martha Stewart faced charges...

57:33.909 --> 57:35.308
Oh, God!

58:15.951 --> 58:17.646
Okay, I think it's on. Go. Go.

58:17.953 --> 58:20.114
Aloha! I'm Henry Roth.

58:20.456 --> 58:26.452
We met here at the Hukilau Cafe
about a year after your accident.

58:26.462 --> 58:29.488
I like you and you like me, most days.

58:29.965 --> 58:33.230
Every day is different, but basically
this is what happens, Lucy.

58:33.469 --> 58:34.902
Kikikoloko, take the camera.

58:34.970 --> 58:36.232
- I got it.
- Don't drop it.

58:36.472 --> 58:38.497
Okay, all right.
Here we are, right here.

58:38.974 --> 58:41.306
The part of you in this reenactment...

58:41.341 --> 58:43.638
...will be played
by my good friend, Ula.

58:44.480 --> 58:47.040
Aloha. Sorry about your brain.

58:47.983 --> 58:49.382
I had a accident too.

58:49.485 --> 58:52.386
Believe it or not, this my good eye.

58:52.988 --> 58:54.216
- We ready?
- Yeah.

58:54.490 --> 58:58.187
Hi. I like that waffle teepee
that you have built.

58:58.494 --> 59:02.396
Oh! So nice of you to notice.
Please, sit down.

59:02.498 --> 59:04.466
I would love to.

59:05.501 --> 59:07.162
My name is Henry, by the way.

59:07.197 --> 59:08.902
My name is Lucy.

59:09.004 --> 59:11.029
Smell my fingers?

59:12.508 --> 59:14.066
Fish. Right on.

59:14.510 --> 59:17.502
So, Lucy, I work at an aquarium.

59:18.013 --> 59:20.481
Aquariums make me super horny.

59:20.516 --> 59:23.178
That's not funny.
Don't rub those.

59:23.519 --> 59:25.510
Sorry, Mr. Whitmore,
if you're watching.

59:25.521 --> 59:27.580
It's very late,
and my friend's unstable.

59:28.023 --> 59:30.719
Come on, stop with the licking!
You're making me sick.

59:30.754 --> 59:32.050
Lucy, I'm sorry.

59:32.528 --> 59:37.056
Anyways, I know you wish I was
making all this stuff up.

59:37.091 --> 59:39.193
I wish I was too.

59:40.536 --> 59:42.002
But the good news is...

59:42.037 --> 59:44.198
...so many people out there
care about you:

59:44.540 --> 59:48.203
Your dad and Doug and a couple
of your friends here at the Hukilau...

59:48.238 --> 59:49.704
...who have a message for you.

59:50.045 --> 59:53.981
Lucy, as you know,
your mother and I were best friends.

59:55.050 --> 59:59.111
That's why I promised her that
I would always help look after you.

01:00:01.056 --> 01:00:04.025
Sometimes life isn't very fair...

01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:06.584
...but we still have you.

01:00:09.064 --> 01:00:12.966
Oh, and if you're wondering about
this guy who's making this tape...

01:00:13.569 --> 01:00:16.197
...he's okay.

01:00:16.572 --> 01:00:20.235
Hey, Lucy. Just so you know,
since you lost your memory...

01:00:20.576 --> 01:00:23.272
...I became governor of Hawaii.

01:00:23.579 --> 01:00:25.945
No, just kidding. I'm too smart.

01:00:28.083 --> 01:00:32.019
Kualaliku! Get your brother
off the dishwasher!

01:00:33.088 --> 01:00:36.114
So whenever you're ready,
we'd all love to talk to you...

01:00:36.149 --> 01:00:38.025
...and answer any questions
you have...

01:00:38.093 --> 01:00:40.926
...and you're the best, Lucy. Aloha.

01:00:56.111 --> 01:00:58.636
How many times
have I watched this?

01:00:59.114 --> 01:01:00.581
This is the first time.

01:01:05.621 --> 01:01:08.454
Okay, she cried for about an hour.
That's not too bad.

01:01:08.624 --> 01:01:12.219
I bet in another hour she'll be ready
to see her friends, have lunch...

01:01:12.628 --> 01:01:13.856
...get her life back.

01:01:14.129 --> 01:01:16.063
We could do this every day.

01:01:18.634 --> 01:01:20.329
We'll leave it up to her.

01:01:20.636 --> 01:01:22.160
All right.

01:01:25.641 --> 01:01:27.836
So how's the cow?

01:01:28.143 --> 01:01:31.374
Same as you. Every day they
have to convince her she's a cow.

01:01:36.151 --> 01:01:38.847
Wow, look. The bark is healing.

01:01:38.882 --> 01:01:40.713
You're gonna get there.

01:01:41.156 --> 01:01:43.818
I never hung out with you
in the afternoon like this.

01:01:44.159 --> 01:01:46.627
In this lighting, man, oh, man,
you look...

01:01:46.662 --> 01:01:48.789
...disgusting.

01:01:49.164 --> 01:01:50.825
Yeah.

01:01:51.166 --> 01:01:56.001
I don't know how you get me to fall for
that egg-shaped head every morning.

01:01:56.171 --> 01:01:59.106
All I have to do is slide on
my designer jeans...

01:01:59.174 --> 01:02:02.701
...and just kind of wiggle
in front of you. You go nuts.

01:02:04.179 --> 01:02:07.842
Why couldn't I have met you one day
before the accident?

01:02:08.183 --> 01:02:11.812
Don't worry, because if you hung out
with me for more than one day...

01:02:12.187 --> 01:02:14.154
...you'd realize I'm a bore.

01:02:14.189 --> 01:02:16.384
- Oh, well, I have news for you.
- Yes?

01:02:16.692 --> 01:02:18.626
It takes less than one day.

01:02:18.694 --> 01:02:20.685
You know something?
That hurt.

01:02:20.696 --> 01:02:23.597
Your damaged temporal lobe
is causing me pain...

01:02:24.199 --> 01:02:26.030
...and I'm gonna get you for that.

01:02:27.202 --> 01:02:29.136
Now you're dead!

01:02:47.723 --> 01:02:50.886
- I can't believe you're pregnant.
- I know.

01:02:51.226 --> 01:02:54.252
- And I got her on the first try.
- Yeah. Easy.

01:02:54.287 --> 01:02:56.026
And, Tammy, you are so thin.

01:02:56.231 --> 01:02:57.562
Thanks, Luce.

01:02:57.733 --> 01:02:59.530
And I'm so glad you finally got...

01:02:59.735 --> 01:03:02.932
...that gender-reassignment surgery,
Jennifer. I mean, Jonathan.

01:03:03.238 --> 01:03:04.899
Mahalo.

01:03:05.741 --> 01:03:07.265
- Here you go, Lucy.
- Thank you.

01:03:07.743 --> 01:03:09.710
- You're welcome.
- You must be Lucy's friend.

01:03:09.745 --> 01:03:13.237
- The one who made the tape.
- I think he's more than my friend.

01:03:13.749 --> 01:03:15.716
- You're my boyfriend, right?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:03:15.751 --> 01:03:18.447
So every day you help her
to realize what happened...

01:03:18.754 --> 01:03:21.518
...and you wait patiently for her
to be okay with it...

01:03:21.757 --> 01:03:23.816
...then get her to fall in love
with you again?

01:03:24.259 --> 01:03:25.521
Yes, ma'am.

01:03:26.762 --> 01:03:27.990
You asshole!

01:03:28.263 --> 01:03:31.323
You don't even open the fricking car
door for me anymore.

01:03:32.267 --> 01:03:33.632
You're in trouble.

01:03:34.770 --> 01:03:36.397
I gotta go tinkle.

01:03:40.776 --> 01:03:44.268
Okay, so tell me a little bit more
about yourself.

01:03:44.279 --> 01:03:46.338
Okay. Well, I've...

01:03:46.782 --> 01:03:49.979
...won over seven all-you-can-eat
chicken-wing contests.

01:03:50.014 --> 01:03:51.912
- Really?
- Yes.

01:03:52.287 --> 01:03:55.313
And I'm a ballet dancer,
but only in my bathroom.

01:03:55.791 --> 01:03:58.225
No, what do you want to know?

01:03:59.795 --> 01:04:01.353
Do you love me?

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:06.665
I didn't mean to put you on the spot.

01:04:06.802 --> 01:04:09.566
I was just asking more for
informational purposes.

01:04:09.805 --> 01:04:12.137
It's to keep the video as up-to-date
as possible.

01:04:12.307 --> 01:04:13.968
Sure.

01:04:14.810 --> 01:04:18.746
Well, love is a very loaded word.

01:04:21.316 --> 01:04:23.307
Let's see. I...

01:04:23.819 --> 01:04:29.121
I go to this restaurant every morning,
and I see you there, reading.

01:04:29.825 --> 01:04:31.690
And...

01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:36.354
I love you very much.

01:04:36.832 --> 01:04:39.960
Probably more than anybody could
love another person.

01:04:43.839 --> 01:04:46.467
And how do I feel about you?

01:04:47.342 --> 01:04:49.810
You're excited about
the chicken-wing thing.

01:04:50.345 --> 01:04:52.142
And...

01:04:52.347 --> 01:04:55.544
...you've been dying to make out
with me for some time now.

01:05:07.362 --> 01:05:08.852
Feeling better now?

01:05:08.864 --> 01:05:11.697
Nothing beats a first kiss.

01:05:19.374 --> 01:05:22.502
There's nothing like a first kiss.

01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:47.027
Nothing beats a first kiss.

01:05:47.402 --> 01:05:49.563
That's what I've heard.

01:05:54.409 --> 01:05:56.536
Nothing beats a first...

01:06:07.923 --> 01:06:09.185
What are you doing?

01:06:09.424 --> 01:06:11.915
Nothing. I was just getting
some lint off for you.

01:06:11.927 --> 01:06:13.895
You were going for a feelski!

01:06:13.929 --> 01:06:18.832
All right, I'm sorry, but this is like the
23rd time we've made out already...

01:06:19.434 --> 01:06:20.924
...and they're getting blue.

01:06:21.436 --> 01:06:23.904
I know. I know.

01:06:23.939 --> 01:06:26.840
I mean, I really don't know.

01:06:26.942 --> 01:06:29.877
For me, it still feels like the first time.

01:06:29.945 --> 01:06:31.640
Okay, let's average it out then.

01:06:31.947 --> 01:06:34.882
It's the 23rd time for me
and the first time for you.

01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:37.282
- That's about our 12th time.
- Yeah?

01:06:37.452 --> 01:06:40.421
Now, Hawaiian law clearly states
after the 12th date...

01:06:40.956 --> 01:06:44.187
...I'm entitled to unlimited
boob access.

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:49.260
Why didn't I meet you one day
before the accident?

01:06:50.465 --> 01:06:52.831
You say that all the time.

01:06:52.968 --> 01:06:54.936
You want to meet a friend of mine?

01:06:58.974 --> 01:07:00.532
All right.

01:07:01.476 --> 01:07:05.207
Jocko, this is Lucy.
Lucy, this is Jocko.

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:09.007
Wow! Thank you. Nice to meet you.

01:07:09.985 --> 01:07:12.510
He is awesome! He is so smart.

01:07:12.988 --> 01:07:17.220
Check this out. Jocko, what does
the teapot do when the water's ready?

01:07:20.495 --> 01:07:22.395
- Very good.
- Can I ask him a question?

01:07:22.497 --> 01:07:24.055
Go ahead.

01:07:24.499 --> 01:07:26.160
Jocko...

01:07:26.501 --> 01:07:30.198
...do you think that Henry and I
are ready to take our relationship...

01:07:30.233 --> 01:07:31.802
...to the next level?

01:07:33.508 --> 01:07:35.271
You sure about that?

01:07:36.011 --> 01:07:38.741
Do you think I should bring him
into the other room...

01:07:39.014 --> 01:07:41.448
...and take advantage of him?

01:07:47.522 --> 01:07:49.319
I saw that hand gesture.

01:07:49.524 --> 01:07:51.492
- And I'm glad you did it.
- Really?

01:08:04.039 --> 01:08:06.007
- Use that.
- Oh, wow. Look!

01:08:06.041 --> 01:08:07.269
- Yeah.
- They're...

01:08:07.542 --> 01:08:09.976
They're nodding in approval, I hope.

01:08:10.045 --> 01:08:12.411
They like you. Let me get them
out of there.

01:08:12.547 --> 01:08:15.664
Mary-Kate, Ashley, get a life.
Thank you. Sorry.

01:08:15.699 --> 01:08:18.781
- Oh, they're very nice, though.
- Yeah, so are you.

01:08:19.054 --> 01:08:21.180
Let me get you down slow.

01:08:21.555 --> 01:08:23.990
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

01:08:46.581 --> 01:08:50.017
All right, I just wrote this,
so go easy on me.

01:08:51.086 --> 01:08:54.715
The Hukilau was the place

01:08:56.091 --> 01:08:58.524
Where I first saw your face

01:09:00.595 --> 01:09:03.223
We liked each other right away

01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:09.229
But you didn't remember me
The very next day

01:09:10.104 --> 01:09:14.073
Forgetful Lucy

01:09:14.109 --> 01:09:17.670
Has got a nice caboose-y

01:09:19.113 --> 01:09:23.312
I used to trick you into pulling
Your car over so we could chat

01:09:23.618 --> 01:09:27.987
But my favorite time was when you
Beat the shit out of Ula with a bat

01:09:28.622 --> 01:09:32.059
And we drove up to see Dr. Keats

01:09:32.627 --> 01:09:35.993
And found out why Doug always
Has to change his sheets

01:09:38.133 --> 01:09:41.600
Forgetful Lucy

01:09:41.636 --> 01:09:46.130
Cracked her head like Gary Busey

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:49.404
But I still love her so

01:09:50.645 --> 01:09:53.910
And I'll never let her go

01:09:55.150 --> 01:09:58.916
Even if while I'm singing this song

01:09:59.654 --> 01:10:02.953
She's wishing I had
Jocko the Walrus' schlong

01:10:04.659 --> 01:10:09.062
Forgetful Lucy

01:10:09.664 --> 01:10:13.964
Her lips are so damn juicy

01:10:13.999 --> 01:10:18.264
How about another first kiss

01:10:28.683 --> 01:10:30.810
Can't fall asleep.

01:10:31.186 --> 01:10:33.154
I'm not sleeping.

01:10:33.188 --> 01:10:35.986
I'm just closing my eyes.

01:10:36.191 --> 01:10:38.421
Well, I'm gonna go downstairs then.

01:10:38.693 --> 01:10:42.891
No, no. I'm just resting.

01:10:44.699 --> 01:10:46.291
Lucy.

01:10:46.701 --> 01:10:48.168
Yeah.

01:10:48.203 --> 01:10:50.194
Will you marry me?

01:10:57.712 --> 01:11:01.079
- Of course.
- Good.

01:11:01.716 --> 01:11:04.310
Don't forget about me.

01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:07.085
Never.

01:11:24.239 --> 01:11:25.672
Good morning.

01:11:32.247 --> 01:11:33.475
Oh, shit!

01:11:33.748 --> 01:11:35.909
- Help! Help!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Lucy.

01:11:35.944 --> 01:11:38.583
Lucy! Lucy! Hey, hey, hey.

01:11:38.753 --> 01:11:40.983
I know this is hard for you
to understand...

01:11:41.256 --> 01:11:43.588
...but we are actually
seeing each other.

01:11:43.758 --> 01:11:45.589
We have been for a while now.

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:46.988
Oh! Lucy! Lucy! Lucy!

01:11:47.262 --> 01:11:49.423
If I was lying,
how would I know this?

01:11:49.764 --> 01:11:52.927
You're an art teacher and you go
to the Hukilau every Sunday...

01:11:53.268 --> 01:11:56.829
...and you make waffle houses
and you like Casablanca lilies.

01:11:56.864 --> 01:12:00.138
- Stalker!
- No, don't you remember me a little?

01:12:07.282 --> 01:12:10.012
I may not be able to kick your ass,
but my sister can.

01:12:10.285 --> 01:12:11.547
Thanks, buddy.

01:12:11.786 --> 01:12:14.550
Little Sammy Sosa's a bit shook up,
but she'll be okay.

01:12:14.789 --> 01:12:16.620
She's watching the tape as we speak.

01:12:16.791 --> 01:12:18.758
How's my temporal lobe
looking there, doc?

01:12:18.793 --> 01:12:22.194
Don't worry. You're not gonna suffer
any short-term memory loss.

01:12:22.797 --> 01:12:25.732
But was your head shaped like an egg
before she hit you?

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:29.133
Don't make fun of Henry.
It's not his fault it's shaped like that.

01:12:29.304 --> 01:12:32.671
Note the intense overreaction.
That's the "roids" talking.

01:12:32.807 --> 01:12:36.504
- Doug, once again, off the juice.
- It's not juice.

01:12:36.811 --> 01:12:38.642
It's a protein shake.

01:12:38.813 --> 01:12:42.647
Henry, the boys tell me you're setting
sail for Alaska to study walruses.

01:12:42.817 --> 01:12:45.615
- When does that adventure begin?
- That actually began...

01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:49.847
...ten years ago. That's when I started
planning and building my boat.

01:12:50.325 --> 01:12:54.455
All I know is, out of all mammals,
they have the second-largest penis.

01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:57.388
I have the first.

01:12:59.334 --> 01:13:00.665
That's my joke.

01:13:00.835 --> 01:13:02.632
Did you tell Lucy about this trip?

01:13:03.338 --> 01:13:04.805
Well...

01:13:04.839 --> 01:13:08.707
...actually, there's nothing to tell
because I decided not to go.

01:13:08.843 --> 01:13:10.640
I mean, Lucy needs me here.

01:13:10.845 --> 01:13:14.042
I'm just worried about
going away for a year...

01:13:14.349 --> 01:13:16.647
...and ruining all the progress
she's made.

01:13:16.851 --> 01:13:18.341
I know you think I'm crazy...

01:13:18.353 --> 01:13:20.116
...but I think deep down inside...

01:13:20.355 --> 01:13:23.847
- ... she's starting to remember me.
- No, Henry.

01:13:23.858 --> 01:13:27.419
That's what you want to believe.
It's what we all want to believe.

01:13:28.363 --> 01:13:29.830
But it's never gonna happen.

01:13:33.868 --> 01:13:35.995
Okay. I gotta go to work.

01:13:36.871 --> 01:13:39.755
Will you tell her I'll be back later
to pick her up?

01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:42.639
See you, guys. Don't tell anyone
your sister beat me up.

01:13:43.378 --> 01:13:47.109
He could go to the moon and back and
Lucy would never even know he left.

01:13:47.382 --> 01:13:50.545
Sometimes I wish my wife
had Goldfield Syndrome.

01:13:50.885 --> 01:13:53.854
That way she wouldn't remember
when I called her mother...

01:13:54.389 --> 01:13:58.689
...a loud, obnoxious drunk with a face
like J. Edgar Hoover's ass.

01:14:00.895 --> 01:14:04.023
All right. There's your medicine,
little fellow.

01:14:04.399 --> 01:14:07.095
Ula! Get back to cleaning the pool!

01:14:07.402 --> 01:14:11.532
If that's one of your special brownies,
don't let any of the dolphins eat that.

01:14:11.906 --> 01:14:15.342
How do you think I get them to
double flip and play with white kids?

01:14:18.913 --> 01:14:20.244
Okay, Willie, that's it.

01:14:20.415 --> 01:14:23.009
This time try to stay clean
for more than a day.

01:14:23.418 --> 01:14:25.613
I made you a nice anchovy sundae.

01:14:25.648 --> 01:14:27.285
Okay, enjoy that.

01:14:27.922 --> 01:14:29.389
Henry?

01:14:29.924 --> 01:14:32.154
- Hey!
- How's your head?

01:14:32.427 --> 01:14:35.590
- Oh, it's fine. Don't worry.
- Good.

01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:37.955
What brings your royal cuteness
out here?

01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:39.331
I needed to see you.

01:14:39.934 --> 01:14:41.424
Okay. What you got there?

01:14:41.936 --> 01:14:44.598
It's my journal. I write in it every night.

01:14:44.939 --> 01:14:47.703
- Oh, you don't like the video?
- No, I love it.

01:14:47.942 --> 01:14:52.311
It's just sometimes when I watch it,
I feel like I'm being told about my life...

01:14:52.447 --> 01:14:54.915
...from someone else.
And when I read this...

01:14:54.949 --> 01:14:57.679
...it's like I'm telling myself.

01:14:57.952 --> 01:14:59.476
When did you start this up?

01:14:59.954 --> 01:15:01.888
Right after you gave me the video.

01:15:01.956 --> 01:15:04.288
- Really?
- I was so nervous to come here...

01:15:04.459 --> 01:15:07.792
...and meet the guy that makes me
fall in love with him every day.

01:15:08.463 --> 01:15:11.523
Well, you probably thought
I couldn't live up to the hype.

01:15:11.558 --> 01:15:15.163
No. I was nervous because...

01:15:17.472 --> 01:15:19.736
Because I came here
to break up with you.

01:15:20.975 --> 01:15:24.944
You had plans and a life...

01:15:24.979 --> 01:15:27.709
...before you met me
and now all you have time for...

01:15:27.982 --> 01:15:30.280
...is to make me fall in love with you.

01:15:30.485 --> 01:15:33.420
That's not all I do.
I gave a penguin a bath today.

01:15:36.491 --> 01:15:38.425
Which I'll have to do again tomorrow.

01:15:38.493 --> 01:15:43.123
I look at my dad and my brother's
lives and I won't do that to you.

01:15:43.498 --> 01:15:47.867
What do you want me to do? Be some
chapter in your scrapbook and go?

01:15:48.002 --> 01:15:49.469
No.

01:15:50.505 --> 01:15:56.933
My plan is to erase you completely,
so it's as if you never existed.

01:15:59.013 --> 01:16:01.140
Why are you doing this?

01:16:02.016 --> 01:16:06.282
Because you have to understand
that there is no future with me.

01:16:06.521 --> 01:16:11.618
Don't you want to have a career
and marriage and children?

01:16:12.026 --> 01:16:14.221
I asked you to marry me. You said yes.

01:16:14.256 --> 01:16:15.859
Kids? Yeah, I'd love to do it.

01:16:17.031 --> 01:16:19.898
But how is that going to work?

01:16:20.034 --> 01:16:24.300
I'm gonna wake up every morning with
an enormous belly and no memory...

01:16:24.539 --> 01:16:25.836
...of how it happened?

01:16:27.542 --> 01:16:30.943
I have to make a new journal
that doesn't have you in it.

01:16:31.045 --> 01:16:32.842
But before I do...

01:16:33.047 --> 01:16:35.777
...I really want you to read
what I wrote about you.

01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:37.915
I will read about it tomorrow...

01:16:38.052 --> 01:16:41.146
...when you forget about all this
breaking up stuff, okay?

01:16:41.556 --> 01:16:44.957
I'm not going to forget it.
I wrote it down. I won't let myself.

01:16:45.059 --> 01:16:48.028
And I'm gonna do it whether
you want me to or not.

01:16:48.563 --> 01:16:50.861
I'll be at my house.

01:16:59.073 --> 01:17:01.268
Okay, type this one in there.

01:17:01.576 --> 01:17:03.339
Saturday, November 25th.

01:17:03.578 --> 01:17:08.379
I drove out to Callahan Institute today
and had a talk with Dr. Keats.

01:17:09.083 --> 01:17:10.880
There's one about me.

01:17:11.085 --> 01:17:15.283
Reminder: He makes funny noises
when I kiss his neck.

01:17:16.591 --> 01:17:18.057
I'm gonna miss that.

01:17:18.092 --> 01:17:20.287
You sure you don't want me
to put that in?

01:17:29.103 --> 01:17:31.070
- We can skip that one.
- No, let me read it.

01:17:31.105 --> 01:17:35.371
We made love tonight! It didn't
last long, but it was incredible.

01:17:38.112 --> 01:17:42.515
It's not all about how long you go. It's...
There was a connection, I thought.

01:17:44.118 --> 01:17:45.847
Actually, let's just rip that out.

01:18:08.643 --> 01:18:11.009
Well, that's that.

01:18:18.653 --> 01:18:20.678
Henry, wait!

01:18:26.661 --> 01:18:29.653
Could I have one last first kiss?

01:19:41.736 --> 01:19:45.263
- I ain't gonna do this, Marlin.
- You have to, Henry.

01:20:18.773 --> 01:20:21.867
I'm gonna miss you, but I gotta
get the hell off this island.

01:20:21.902 --> 01:20:23.300
I'm sorry I can't take you...

01:20:23.778 --> 01:20:27.805
...but you've lived here so long you're
too big of a pansy to defend yourself.

01:20:29.283 --> 01:20:32.980
I don't feel bad for you. I know you
got a thing going on with Candace.

01:20:36.791 --> 01:20:38.258
Candace and Bernice?

01:20:40.795 --> 01:20:42.660
Candace, Bernice and Rose?

01:20:44.799 --> 01:20:48.428
Yeah. I fell for one chick and I'm losing
my mind. Good luck with that.

01:20:48.803 --> 01:20:50.202
Okay, baby.

01:20:50.304 --> 01:20:51.965
I love you.

01:20:52.306 --> 01:20:54.774
Thanks, buddy.
Remember to use a condom.

01:20:55.309 --> 01:20:57.300
Or in your case, a Hefty bag.

01:21:07.822 --> 01:21:09.255
Well...

01:21:09.323 --> 01:21:12.417
Okay, you guys. Thanks for coming
to say goodbye.

01:21:12.827 --> 01:21:14.522
Be careful.

01:21:14.829 --> 01:21:17.764
You make sure your father doesn't
get eaten by a shark.

01:21:24.338 --> 01:21:27.273
Thank you, buddy.
What does that mean again?

01:21:27.842 --> 01:21:29.639
Bring me back a T-shirt.

01:21:29.844 --> 01:21:32.176
Oh, okay. You got it.

01:21:32.847 --> 01:21:35.042
Come here. All right. Love you guys.

01:21:35.850 --> 01:21:38.785
My shirt size is medium husky.

01:21:40.855 --> 01:21:43.153
Hey! Kikikuloa!

01:21:43.357 --> 01:21:46.155
No flippies off the dock!
You could get hurt!

01:21:48.863 --> 01:21:53.732
No! All right. Let the master
show you how to get it done.

01:22:01.876 --> 01:22:05.505
Now you kids go down there
and find my nuts.

01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:07.711
Sure you don't want to take Doug?

01:22:07.882 --> 01:22:11.511
Hey! What the heck
are you guys doing here?

01:22:11.886 --> 01:22:16.448
I spoke to the harbormaster and he
said you were setting sail today...

01:22:16.483 --> 01:22:18.620
...so we thought we'd wish
you bon voyage.

01:22:18.893 --> 01:22:21.885
This is from Nick and Sue.
They send their best wishes.

01:22:22.396 --> 01:22:26.230
That's very nice.
Spam and Reese's. All right.

01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:28.800
I love Spam and Reese's.
Can I have it?

01:22:28.903 --> 01:22:30.495
I guess.

01:22:31.405 --> 01:22:33.498
- Doug!
- That's all right.

01:22:33.533 --> 01:22:36.433
- I'm sorry.
- So...

01:22:37.411 --> 01:22:38.673
...how's Lucy?

01:22:39.413 --> 01:22:42.143
Actually, she's living at the institute.

01:22:42.917 --> 01:22:46.284
- When did that happen?
- Three weeks ago.

01:22:46.921 --> 01:22:50.652
Said she didn't want to be a burden to
me and Doug anymore. I don't know.

01:22:50.925 --> 01:22:53.393
I couldn't talk her out of it.
You know what?

01:22:53.427 --> 01:22:55.622
She's doing really great up there.

01:22:55.930 --> 01:22:58.990
She's teaching an art class
and she gets to paint every day.

01:22:59.433 --> 01:23:01.264
In fact, she's even singing again.

01:23:01.435 --> 01:23:03.630
Hey, look, I got a little gift
for you too.

01:23:03.938 --> 01:23:07.738
It's just a little something
from one sailor to another one.

01:23:09.443 --> 01:23:11.377
You take care of yourself out there.

01:23:11.946 --> 01:23:14.380
- I will.
- Okay.

01:23:22.957 --> 01:23:24.891
Henry did not tell me about you.

01:23:24.959 --> 01:23:27.553
Your fisherman muscles.

01:23:28.462 --> 01:23:29.724
Can I touch?

01:23:29.964 --> 01:23:31.795
Sure.

01:23:37.471 --> 01:23:39.405
Yes.

01:23:46.981 --> 01:23:48.278
The Beach Boys?

01:23:48.482 --> 01:23:51.349
How nice of him to give me a CD
that will remind me...

01:23:51.986 --> 01:23:55.444
...of all the wonderful times
I shared with his daughter.

01:23:55.489 --> 01:23:57.889
What an asshole!

01:24:16.510 --> 01:24:18.535
Oh, why?

01:24:19.013 --> 01:24:21.345
Why would you do this to me?

01:24:21.515 --> 01:24:24.040
You sick bastard!

01:24:28.522 --> 01:24:30.080
Oh, my God.

01:24:31.025 --> 01:24:32.959
Is he trying to tell me something?

01:24:37.531 --> 01:24:39.965
She only sings on days
she meets you.

01:24:42.036 --> 01:24:44.004
She remembers me?

01:24:44.538 --> 01:24:46.130
Holy shit!

01:24:47.541 --> 01:24:50.305
She remembers me!

01:24:55.549 --> 01:24:57.466
Julia, that looks great.

01:24:57.501 --> 01:24:59.383
Excuse me. What am I doing?

01:25:00.054 --> 01:25:03.319
You're painting a picture.
And you're doing an excellent job.

01:25:03.557 --> 01:25:05.184
Oh.

01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:09.586
Holy crap! I suck.

01:25:18.072 --> 01:25:19.767
Hey, hey, hey.

01:25:20.074 --> 01:25:22.907
- Can we help you, sir?
- Yes. I have an appointment.

01:25:23.077 --> 01:25:25.511
- What's your name?
- My name?

01:25:28.082 --> 01:25:31.279
Dude, he forgot his name.
I feel bad for him.

01:25:31.585 --> 01:25:34.486
Just go on up. And good luck
with that memory problem.

01:25:34.588 --> 01:25:36.579
Yeah. Thank you.

01:25:38.592 --> 01:25:39.889
What?

01:25:40.594 --> 01:25:42.687
Lucy!

01:25:43.097 --> 01:25:44.792
Lucy!

01:25:45.099 --> 01:25:47.749
- Hi, I'm Tom.
- Hey, I met you before. I'm Henry.

01:25:47.784 --> 01:25:50.399
Maybe you can help me.
I'm looking for Lucy Whitmore.

01:25:50.604 --> 01:25:52.128
Any idea where I can find her?

01:25:52.606 --> 01:25:53.572
Hi, I'm Tom.

01:25:53.607 --> 01:25:56.576
Oh. Thanks anyways.

01:25:57.611 --> 01:25:59.476
Lucy!

01:26:00.114 --> 01:26:01.581
Lucy!

01:26:05.619 --> 01:26:07.382
Lucy Whitmore...

01:26:08.622 --> 01:26:10.487
...can I ask you a question?

01:26:13.627 --> 01:26:15.822
Do you have any idea who I am?

01:26:22.136 --> 01:26:25.299
- No.
- No?

01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:28.665
That sucks.

01:26:30.144 --> 01:26:33.136
- What's your name?
- I'm Henry.

01:26:33.647 --> 01:26:35.410
Henry.

01:26:36.650 --> 01:26:39.517
I want to show you something.
Will you come with me?

01:26:40.154 --> 01:26:41.553
Well, yeah.

01:26:43.157 --> 01:26:45.091
Hey. Do you know who that guy is?

01:26:45.159 --> 01:26:47.320
Dude, I don't even know who I am.

01:26:47.661 --> 01:26:49.925
Oh, well, you're Pablo Picasso.

01:26:50.164 --> 01:26:53.861
- Really?
- No. Not really.

01:26:57.171 --> 01:26:59.833
This is my studio.

01:27:19.193 --> 01:27:21.855
I don't know who you are, Henry...

01:27:23.697 --> 01:27:27.633
...but I dream about you
almost every night.

01:27:30.204 --> 01:27:31.728
Why?

01:27:32.206 --> 01:27:36.267
What would you say if I told you
that notebook you read every day...

01:27:36.710 --> 01:27:39.736
...used to have a lot of stuff
about me in it?

01:27:41.215 --> 01:27:43.809
I would say that that
makes a lot of sense.

01:27:44.218 --> 01:27:46.015
You erased me
from your memories...

01:27:46.220 --> 01:27:49.383
...because you thought you were
holding me back from having...

01:27:49.723 --> 01:27:51.452
...a full and happy life.

01:27:51.725 --> 01:27:54.216
But you made a mistake.

01:27:54.728 --> 01:27:58.357
Being with you is the only way
I could have a full and happy life.

01:27:59.233 --> 01:28:01.497
You're the girl of my dreams...

01:28:01.735 --> 01:28:05.501
...and apparently I'm the man of yours.

01:28:10.244 --> 01:28:12.007
Henry.

01:28:12.246 --> 01:28:13.645
It's nice to meet you.

01:28:14.248 --> 01:28:17.240
Lucy, it's nice to meet you too.

01:28:21.755 --> 01:28:23.723
Hi, I'm Tom.

01:28:23.757 --> 01:28:25.918
Henry, Lucy. Nice to meet you, Tom.

01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:29.889
Now why don't you come back in
ten seconds so we can meet again?

01:29:15.309 --> 01:29:18.904
Do you, Honah Lee, take this woman
to be your lawfully wedded wife...

01:29:18.939 --> 01:29:21.178
...to have and to hold
from this day forth...

01:29:21.815 --> 01:29:23.908
...as long as you both shall live?

01:29:23.943 --> 01:29:25.785
- I do.
- Really?

01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:28.515
Even though in, like, 10, 15 years...

01:29:28.822 --> 01:29:31.518
...she could possibly let herself
go and then, like...

01:29:31.553 --> 01:29:33.691
...sex could be, like,
nauseating for you?

01:29:33.827 --> 01:29:36.523
What are you, nuts?
Your wife's right over there.

01:29:38.832 --> 01:29:40.561
I'm just kidding, Muumuu!

01:29:40.834 --> 01:29:43.701
I now pronounce you man and wife.

01:29:48.842 --> 01:29:51.310
Mazel tov!

01:29:52.346 --> 01:29:54.439
It's very cold, so when you're ready...

01:29:54.848 --> 01:29:58.477
...put on a jacket and come have
breakfast with me. Love you.

01:30:30.384 --> 01:30:35.481
Hey, hey! Good morning, Mrs. Roth.
Would you like to meet your daughter?

01:30:35.889 --> 01:30:37.151
Go say hello to Mommy.

01:30:38.892 --> 01:30:40.553
Hi, Mommy.

01:30:42.896 --> 01:30:44.887
That's right.

01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:48.027
Good morning.

01:30:49.903 --> 01:30:52.064
Oh, my goodness!

01:30:52.906 --> 01:30:55.238
- Grandpa's here.
- Hi, Dad.

01:30:56.305 --> 01:31:02.937
