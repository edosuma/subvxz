48:19.801 --> 48:21.169
[Jules] What a fucking joke.

48:21.869 --> 48:24.472
[Annie] This is not a joke, Jules.
He totally knows.

48:24.539 --> 48:27.108
[Jules] Annie, calm down.
He doesn't have anything on us.

48:27.175 --> 48:29.377
If he did,
our parents would've been in the room.

48:29.444 --> 48:31.212
Yeah, well, they will be on Monday.

48:31.279 --> 48:33.781
Annie, we're going to be out of here.

48:33.848 --> 48:35.883
It's fine. Just relax.

48:36.584 --> 48:37.685
You trust me, right?

48:38.486 --> 48:40.221
- I don't know, Jules.
- What?

48:40.288 --> 48:42.156
- I mean...
- What do you mean you don't know?

48:42.223 --> 48:44.492
We don't have enough money.
How are we getting out?

48:44.559 --> 48:46.661
My parents are gonna make me
change schools.

48:46.728 --> 48:49.397
[Jules] Calm down, calm down.
We're going to be fine.

48:51.599 --> 48:52.600
God, it's Alex.

48:53.434 --> 48:54.702
That cocksucker.

48:55.703 --> 48:56.703
- Hey!
- Jules.

48:57.338 --> 48:58.473
What are you doing?

49:00.742 --> 49:02.243
[Jules] Hey, asshole.

49:07.615 --> 49:09.450
Whoa, the fuck?

49:11.185 --> 49:12.720
I thought you liked being on camera.

49:13.654 --> 49:14.789
[Jules] Fuck you, Alex.

49:15.556 --> 49:17.825
Don't forget that last year
you were wearing flares

49:17.892 --> 49:20.228
and getting your ass kicked
by Cody Foster.

49:23.197 --> 49:24.197
You're pathetic.

49:25.733 --> 49:26.734
You're worthless.

49:27.668 --> 49:28.569
Oh, shit.

49:28.636 --> 49:29.636
Shut up, eyebrows.

49:29.670 --> 49:31.272
Annie doesn't like you either.

49:32.507 --> 49:33.508
[Scott clears throat]

49:33.574 --> 49:36.544
I am so happy that you showed up.

49:36.911 --> 49:40.348
I don't know how much longer I could've
kept faking it with this idiot.

49:44.819 --> 49:46.854
This is as good as it gets for you guys.

49:47.855 --> 49:48.855
It sucks.

49:49.524 --> 49:51.959
Ten years from now, you're gonna be fat,

49:52.960 --> 49:54.862
balding, in debt,

49:55.563 --> 49:58.433
doing the same boring shit
with the same boring people

49:58.499 --> 50:00.768
in the same boring-ass fucking town.

50:02.470 --> 50:05.206
So, really remember this moment, boys...

50:06.274 --> 50:07.275
revel in it...

50:09.644 --> 50:11.279
'cause this is you at your peak.

50:24.826 --> 50:28.863
- I thought that we had more.
- Not enough. This isn't even close.

50:30.898 --> 50:33.367
Well, what are we gonna do?
I mean, we can't leave.

50:37.839 --> 50:38.839
We step it up.

50:39.807 --> 50:42.477
We go on the Internet
and we find someone local.

50:43.411 --> 50:46.647
Jules, you're not gonna go fuck
some random guy?

50:46.714 --> 50:50.284
"I'll do whatever it takes." Isn't that
what you just said in the bathroom?

50:51.552 --> 50:52.552
That's not fair.

51:04.298 --> 51:05.800
You're out of your mind.

51:07.902 --> 51:11.539
If you have any other ideas,
now would be the time to voice them.

51:17.011 --> 51:18.011
Posted.

51:21.883 --> 51:24.919
Jules, you're fucking crazy.
There's no way you're doing that.

51:27.755 --> 51:29.757
Now we just sit back and wait.

52:14.835 --> 52:16.370
[computer dings]

52:17.705 --> 52:18.839
Hey, this guy might work.

52:20.575 --> 52:21.876
He's kind of cute.

52:25.479 --> 52:26.479
You wanna see?

52:28.616 --> 52:29.616
Come on.

52:30.551 --> 52:31.551
Just come look.

52:40.861 --> 52:41.861
What do you think?

52:42.964 --> 52:44.932
- Hmm?
- No.

52:46.400 --> 52:47.668
He's harmless.

52:52.073 --> 52:54.141
If anything goes wrong at all,

52:54.942 --> 52:58.379
I'll get us both pepper spray.
If you have any weird feelings,

52:58.446 --> 53:00.748
we're out of there,
no questions asked. I promise.

53:08.422 --> 53:10.658
Come on, I'm only asking you
this one time.

53:12.126 --> 53:13.961
Never again, I promise you.

53:21.535 --> 53:22.603
One team, one dream.

53:29.877 --> 53:30.878
[sighs]

53:35.049 --> 53:37.685
Okay, but if the slightest thing
weirds me out...

53:37.752 --> 53:38.986
We're out of there, I swear.

53:40.488 --> 53:42.723
- Okay, fine, then I'll do it.
- [squeals]

53:42.790 --> 53:44.792
[Jules laughing]

53:47.828 --> 53:50.431
All right, but first
I have to make a stop home.

54:07.782 --> 54:08.849
So, how's it going?

54:10.451 --> 54:11.451
Good.

54:12.653 --> 54:13.653
Everything's fine?

54:14.822 --> 54:15.822
Yeah.

54:17.591 --> 54:18.591
School?

54:19.193 --> 54:20.193
Good.

54:21.228 --> 54:22.997
You getting caught up
on your work yet?

54:23.064 --> 54:24.064
Mm-hm.

54:27.868 --> 54:29.670
Annie, look at me.

54:33.174 --> 54:34.174
What?

54:35.509 --> 54:36.944
What? What did I do now?

54:37.945 --> 54:40.881
Okay, well, first of all,
let's discuss this attitude of yours.

54:41.248 --> 54:44.118
What attitude? I'm just sitting here
trying to eat my dinner.

54:44.185 --> 54:45.920
You know what, take it down a notch.

54:45.986 --> 54:49.523
Do not take that tone with me.
You are still 17 years old, okay?

54:49.590 --> 54:50.524
I'm almost 18.

54:50.591 --> 54:52.893
Yeah, and I'm still your mother,
for crying out loud.

54:53.761 --> 54:57.865
Listen, I don't know why you always
treat me like I'm out to hurt you

54:57.932 --> 54:59.767
when all I wanna do is help you.

55:00.968 --> 55:05.606
Okay, this act that you've got going on,
I'm over it.

55:05.673 --> 55:09.243
This tortured teenage bullshit is a bore.

55:10.644 --> 55:14.081
Yeah, that's right, it's bullshit, Annie.
Come on, really?

55:14.882 --> 55:17.151
Really, you've got it that rough, huh?

55:17.752 --> 55:19.854
Me and your father,
we're monsters to you?

55:21.055 --> 55:22.055
No.

55:23.758 --> 55:25.126
Then what the hell is going on?

55:25.893 --> 55:29.697
I don't get it. You're constantly out.
You're sneaking in all hours of the night.

55:29.764 --> 55:31.532
You think I don't know about it?

55:31.599 --> 55:34.802
You're really, really
testing my trust right now.

55:36.270 --> 55:38.639
I'm just hanging out with Jules,
that's all.

55:38.706 --> 55:40.775
It's not like we're doing anything.

55:41.242 --> 55:42.242
I swear.

55:47.681 --> 55:48.949
Okay, look, I know...

55:50.184 --> 55:54.221
you might find this very difficult
to believe, but it was not that long ago

55:54.288 --> 55:55.890
when I was your age.

55:56.924 --> 55:57.858
Okay?

55:57.925 --> 55:59.860
And I remember what it was like.

55:59.927 --> 56:00.927
I do.

56:01.762 --> 56:05.166
And I had you when I was very young.

56:07.601 --> 56:10.271
What are you saying, that I was, like,
a mistake or something?

56:11.071 --> 56:14.875
No, Annie, you were a blessing, okay?
But I'm not going to lie to you.

56:14.942 --> 56:15.942
It was...

56:16.811 --> 56:20.047
hard. It was really fucking hard, okay?

56:20.114 --> 56:22.616
And you need to remember one thing,
that you and I,

56:22.683 --> 56:26.921
we are playing on the same team, okay?
I am with you.

56:27.988 --> 56:29.924
I am always with you.

56:29.990 --> 56:31.258
I am your mother.

56:31.325 --> 56:33.794
I will always have your back 100 percent.

56:33.861 --> 56:36.030
I am never against you, okay?

56:36.931 --> 56:40.801
I just want shit to be a little bit
easier for you. That's all.

56:43.771 --> 56:44.805
Okay, I'm sorry.

56:51.178 --> 56:52.780
School called. [Clears throat]

56:52.847 --> 56:55.883
They want us, uh... to go in on Monday.

56:57.251 --> 57:00.020
I haven't told your father yet.
You know anything about it?

57:01.021 --> 57:02.021
No.

57:05.993 --> 57:07.962
Okay, Annie,
I'm giving you a chance here.

57:09.697 --> 57:11.131
What? I don't know anything.

57:12.967 --> 57:15.102
I don't.
I don't know anything about Monday.

57:20.074 --> 57:21.775
- You finished?
- Yeah.

57:23.711 --> 57:24.711
Take it to the sink.

57:33.687 --> 57:34.687
[Tom] Sweetie?

57:35.022 --> 57:36.022
You okay?

57:46.267 --> 57:48.002
So, everything's awesome?

57:53.741 --> 57:54.741
I don't...

57:55.042 --> 57:57.978
I don't know what to do.
I have no fucking idea what to do.

57:58.279 --> 58:00.681
Baby, she's a teenage girl.

58:00.981 --> 58:02.917
She's got a wall up and it's just...

58:05.352 --> 58:06.352
I have no idea.

58:07.454 --> 58:09.690
Honey, you were a teenage girl once, too.

58:10.457 --> 58:14.995
I know... except my mother
was a total bitch.

58:15.729 --> 58:17.698
Yeah, that's what you thought at the time.

58:19.433 --> 58:21.435
Really? You're calling me
a bitch right now?

58:21.702 --> 58:23.170
- Never.
- Is that what you're doing?

58:25.372 --> 58:26.372
Never.

58:29.777 --> 58:30.777
Annie?

58:33.113 --> 58:34.113
Annie?

58:58.239 --> 58:59.273
[computer dinging]

59:42.516 --> 59:46.186
[Annie] Nick? Nick, are you in my room?
You're not allowed in my room.

59:46.253 --> 59:48.455
- Hi. I, um...
- What are you doing in here?

59:49.556 --> 59:50.557
Mom sent you, huh?

59:52.793 --> 59:55.229
I know you said to try and be cool
with Mom and I am.

59:55.296 --> 01:00:00.334
I'm honestly trying but it's like she just
gets so intense and bitchy sometimes.

01:00:00.401 --> 01:00:02.169
I don't know how to make her happy.

01:00:03.370 --> 01:00:04.872
I mean, how do you handle her?

01:00:08.342 --> 01:00:09.342
What?

01:00:15.282 --> 01:00:16.317
[computer dinging]

01:00:24.925 --> 01:00:25.925
Dad?

01:00:44.445 --> 01:00:45.445
What?

01:00:52.319 --> 01:00:54.254
Remember when I won you
that blue dog?

01:01:02.296 --> 01:01:03.530
I love you, honey.

01:01:04.398 --> 01:01:05.398
I love you, too.

01:01:14.241 --> 01:01:15.241
Good night.

01:01:18.579 --> 01:01:19.579
Good night.

01:01:27.154 --> 01:01:28.322
I wanna be Clementine.

01:01:29.223 --> 01:01:31.458
- That's cute.
- Okay.

01:01:31.525 --> 01:01:33.227
Kitty and Clementine. Okay.

01:01:37.131 --> 01:01:38.532
Look at how big these homes are.

01:01:41.535 --> 01:01:45.406
You know, at least they're close together,
so, if we scream somebody will hear us.

01:01:45.472 --> 01:01:47.274
Oh, my God, stop, Annie.

01:01:47.341 --> 01:01:48.542
No, but seriously.

01:01:48.609 --> 01:01:49.610
That's a good thing.

01:01:49.676 --> 01:01:51.912
- [Jules] All right, 17609?
- Uh-huh.

01:01:54.948 --> 01:01:55.948
[Jules] Okay, this is...

01:01:56.583 --> 01:01:58.018
- [Annie] This is it?
- Yeah.

01:02:14.535 --> 01:02:16.470
Fuck, should I park the car
on the street?

01:02:18.405 --> 01:02:19.940
I don't know if I can do this.

01:02:21.141 --> 01:02:22.141
Hey.

01:02:23.477 --> 01:02:24.477
It's just sex.

01:02:25.212 --> 01:02:27.214
That's all it is. It means nothing, okay?

01:02:27.281 --> 01:02:28.281
Okay.

01:02:28.715 --> 01:02:32.453
Everybody who you ever sleep with is gonna
be a stranger at some point, right?

01:02:34.354 --> 01:02:35.689
Just follow my lead, okay?

01:02:37.391 --> 01:02:39.626
This night is gonna change
the rest of our lives.

01:02:41.628 --> 01:02:42.628
Right?

01:02:45.365 --> 01:02:46.365
I'm so nervous.

01:02:51.038 --> 01:02:52.072
Fuck, so am I.

01:02:54.074 --> 01:02:55.976
Should we go? Should we go back?

01:02:56.043 --> 01:02:59.146
Maybe we should go to my house
and we can figure something else out.

01:02:59.213 --> 01:03:00.247
No, we can do this.

01:03:10.357 --> 01:03:11.458
Liquid courage?

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:14.760
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:03:23.070 --> 01:03:24.070
Give me another.

01:03:27.207 --> 01:03:28.375
Ah.

01:03:29.209 --> 01:03:30.644
Ah. Okay.

01:03:39.653 --> 01:03:41.054
Are you ready, Clementine?

01:03:43.290 --> 01:03:44.290
I'm ready, Kitty.

01:03:53.534 --> 01:03:55.335
[doorbell rings]

01:04:00.507 --> 01:04:02.342
You sure this is the right place?

01:04:02.409 --> 01:04:03.477
It better be.

01:04:09.082 --> 01:04:10.250
Frank?

01:04:12.619 --> 01:04:14.555
- Kitty.
- Uh-huh.

01:04:14.621 --> 01:04:16.390
[Frank chuckles]

01:04:18.091 --> 01:04:20.327
This is my best friend, Clementine.

01:04:22.462 --> 01:04:23.764
Pleasure to meet you, ladies.

01:04:33.373 --> 01:04:34.575
Can we come in?

01:04:35.208 --> 01:04:37.377
Oh, yeah, sure. Of course. I'm sorry.

01:04:37.444 --> 01:04:39.479
It's been a really long day.
Please, come in.

01:04:42.649 --> 01:04:43.817
[Jules] Ooh.

01:04:57.230 --> 01:04:58.711
[Annie] Something smells really good.

01:04:59.266 --> 01:05:01.201
[Frank] Well, I'm making us
a nice little dinner.

01:05:01.768 --> 01:05:04.204
I just opened some champagne.
Would you like some?

01:05:04.738 --> 01:05:06.506
- Yeah.
- We'd love some.

01:05:06.573 --> 01:05:07.573
Okay.

01:05:10.310 --> 01:05:12.412
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

01:05:20.754 --> 01:05:21.754
[Jules] Thanks.

01:05:22.422 --> 01:05:23.422
[Annie] Thank you.

01:05:32.666 --> 01:05:34.434
Last but not least.

01:05:38.171 --> 01:05:39.171
Toast.

01:05:39.539 --> 01:05:40.574
To tonight.

01:05:41.274 --> 01:05:42.376
[both scream]

01:05:42.442 --> 01:05:44.444
[both laughing]

01:05:45.812 --> 01:05:48.281
- Oh, my gosh.
- [Frank] Is everything okay?

01:05:48.348 --> 01:05:50.851
Yeah, Annie just tried to kill me.

01:05:52.552 --> 01:05:53.552
Annie?

01:05:55.489 --> 01:05:57.357
That's Clementine's middle name.

01:05:57.424 --> 01:05:58.859
I like to call her that sometime.

01:06:00.293 --> 01:06:03.463
Names, names, names,
first names, last names.

01:06:03.530 --> 01:06:04.931
What's in a name, right, Frank?

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:12.906
- PS, this food looks amazing.
- Oh, my God, young, successful, handsome.

01:06:13.407 --> 01:06:16.243
You can cook.
Is there anything you don't do?

01:06:18.345 --> 01:06:19.713
Mm.

01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:21.381
I can't believe some cougar

01:06:21.448 --> 01:06:24.317
hasn't gotten you to walk her
down the aisle yet. Oh, my God.

01:06:26.353 --> 01:06:27.754
Oh, I almost forgot.

01:06:29.623 --> 01:06:33.794
A good friend of mine once told me
that seafood is best served with...

01:06:34.728 --> 01:06:36.363
[whispering] God, we hit the jackpot.

01:06:36.430 --> 01:06:38.498
He's harmless and he's fucking loaded.

01:06:38.965 --> 01:06:39.965
Yeah.

01:06:49.209 --> 01:06:52.512
It's been so long
since I've entertained. [Chuckles]

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:01.388
[Jules chuckles]

01:07:01.455 --> 01:07:02.455
[Frank] All right.

01:07:07.327 --> 01:07:09.128
[in normal voice] What...?
What about a toast?

01:07:10.397 --> 01:07:11.431
To our host.

01:07:13.366 --> 01:07:14.567
- To Frank.
- [Annie] To Frank.

01:07:22.609 --> 01:07:25.879
I couldn't help but notice
that you have a Jacuzzi outside.

01:07:27.948 --> 01:07:32.352
It's the best way to relax
after a, uh, rough day at the office.

01:07:32.419 --> 01:07:33.553
[all chuckle]

01:07:36.490 --> 01:07:40.794
Don't you think it would be a good idea
if the three of us took a dip

01:07:40.861 --> 01:07:41.861
after dinner?

01:07:51.304 --> 01:07:52.304
You want some?

01:07:52.706 --> 01:07:53.706
Yeah, give me some.

01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:55.809
[Jules] Mm-mm. Hands down.

01:07:56.610 --> 01:07:57.610
Open up.

01:08:05.318 --> 01:08:06.318
Clementine?

01:08:06.686 --> 01:08:08.522
[Annie] I would love some more.

01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:16.062
[both giggle]

01:08:17.798 --> 01:08:18.832
[chuckles]

01:08:24.337 --> 01:08:25.572
Frankie.

01:08:27.073 --> 01:08:28.675
Frankie, baby.

01:08:29.376 --> 01:08:30.376
Yeah.

01:08:35.849 --> 01:08:37.850
Clementine and I have been talking.

01:08:40.921 --> 01:08:42.322
We really like you.

01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:49.462
Yeah? I really like you guys, too.

01:08:51.698 --> 01:08:53.066
- You do?
- [Frank] Yeah.

01:08:55.902 --> 01:08:59.872
It's so sexy to see a man who's able
to make his dreams come true.

01:09:01.707 --> 01:09:05.745
[laughs] I mean,
this place is fucking epic.

01:09:05.812 --> 01:09:07.080
It's aces.

01:09:10.783 --> 01:09:12.018
[Jules moans]

01:09:12.085 --> 01:09:13.085
Thank you.

01:09:15.354 --> 01:09:18.892
[Jules] But, you know,
we've got dreams, too, baby.

01:09:18.959 --> 01:09:19.993
Uh-huh.

01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:21.394
[Jules] You know?
- Uh-huh.

01:09:21.461 --> 01:09:23.381
- [Jules] You know what I'm talking about?
- Yes.

01:09:25.131 --> 01:09:28.702
And we need the help of a really nice,
generous man like you.

01:09:28.768 --> 01:09:29.768
[Frank] Yeah.

01:09:32.471 --> 01:09:34.152
- You know what I'm saying?
- [Frank] Yeah.

01:09:36.977 --> 01:09:41.747
I really think 5000 bucks could go a long
way into helping our dreams come true.

01:09:42.749 --> 01:09:43.783
Five thousand?

01:09:45.452 --> 01:09:47.453
Don't act like you don't have it.

01:09:49.756 --> 01:09:51.892
Yeah, but, no, that...

01:09:52.826 --> 01:09:54.995
That's not the figure
that we discussed before.

01:09:56.129 --> 01:09:59.499
I mean, I didn't make all my money
by being a pushover.

01:10:01.835 --> 01:10:03.603
Anything you want.

01:10:06.006 --> 01:10:07.006
Anything.

01:10:08.508 --> 01:10:10.410
Everything you want.

01:10:11.444 --> 01:10:14.981
All night long, Frank.

01:10:35.502 --> 01:10:38.004
I don't know about you,
but I would say that's a bargain.

01:10:38.071 --> 01:10:39.071
Don't you think?

01:10:39.539 --> 01:10:40.840
Oh, that's a steal.

01:10:44.844 --> 01:10:46.012
[Jules] Last offer, Frank.

01:10:46.079 --> 01:10:47.147
Take it or leave it.

01:10:54.521 --> 01:10:55.689
[Jules whispering] Closer.

01:10:58.892 --> 01:11:00.493
- Get in.
- [whispering] Okay, like this?

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:01.801
[Jules] Get closer to his face.

01:11:05.098 --> 01:11:05.966
Huh?

01:11:06.032 --> 01:11:07.767
[in normal voice] Hey, Frank...

01:11:10.036 --> 01:11:11.137
we gotta get going.

01:11:11.204 --> 01:11:12.505
[grunts]

01:11:13.606 --> 01:11:15.775
- What time is it?
- It's still pretty early.

01:11:15.842 --> 01:11:17.210
You should go back to sleep.

01:11:17.477 --> 01:11:19.612
We can let ourselves out. Don't worry.

01:11:22.115 --> 01:11:23.516
[Annie in normal voice] Ta-ta.

01:11:26.686 --> 01:11:27.887
It's been fun.

01:11:32.225 --> 01:11:34.127
[grunts]

01:11:35.762 --> 01:11:37.230
[Jules] That wasn't so bad, was it?

01:11:37.764 --> 01:11:39.032
It could've been worse.

01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:41.835
What was the photo for?

01:11:42.635 --> 01:11:43.670
Spending money.

01:11:44.704 --> 01:11:45.572
You'll see.

01:11:45.638 --> 01:11:48.208

Oh, Jesus Christ.

<i>Hugs and kisses, Kitty and Clementine.</i>

01:16:15.842 --> 01:16:17.343
[Jules] So, we're meeting him at the cafÃ©.

01:16:17.410 --> 01:16:19.145
[Annie] What if he doesn't show?

01:16:19.212 --> 01:16:22.115
- [Jules] We make do with what we have.
- [Annie] Okay.

01:16:23.249 --> 01:16:26.286
[Jules] I'll pick you up in the morning,
like always.

01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:29.355

[Lynn] Annie, Jules is outside!

01:16:51.344 --> 01:16:52.344
[Annie] Morning.

01:16:55.148 --> 01:16:57.016
[Lynn] Don't forget
we have that meeting today.

01:17:09.028 --> 01:17:10.229
[Tom] See you in a little bit.

01:17:46.299 --> 01:17:47.299
I love you, Mom.

[Lynn] I love you, too, Annie.

01:18:30.042 --> 01:18:31.077
Maybe we should wait.

Wait for what?

Hello?

01:18:49.462 --> 01:18:51.063
I'm scared, Jules.

01:18:51.564 --> 01:18:53.433
I mean, we've taken this way too far.

01:18:53.499 --> 01:18:57.370
I don't... Blackmail, the webcamming?

01:18:57.437 --> 01:19:00.206
I just left my family.
I don't know what I'm doing anymore.

01:19:00.273 --> 01:19:02.141
I mean, do we even know
what we're doing?

01:19:04.510 --> 01:19:05.510
I knew it.

01:19:07.447 --> 01:19:08.447
Knew what?

01:19:12.318 --> 01:19:14.020
You don't really love me.

01:19:14.487 --> 01:19:16.355
Of course I do.
How could you say that?

01:19:16.422 --> 01:19:17.690
No, you don't.

01:19:18.357 --> 01:19:20.560
You don't love me!

- No, no, no. Please don't go.
- Okay.

01:20:23.022 --> 01:20:24.724
It's okay. I'm gonna be right back.

01:20:24.790 --> 01:20:26.092
