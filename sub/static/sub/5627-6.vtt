00:04.305 --> 00:07.439
¶ uh-uh ¶

00:07.441 --> 00:10.442

¶ come on ¶

00:13.381 --> 00:15.114

¶ come on ¶

00:24.425 --> 00:25.691

I know how to get out ¶

00:45.212 --> 00:48.714
¶ 'cause, 'cause

00:48.716 --> 00:49.715
Huh?

00:49.717 --> 00:51.483
¶ that's how it works ¶

00:51.485 --> 00:52.785
Where's paige?

00:52.787 --> 00:54.720
¶ oh ooh ¶

00:54.722 --> 00:56.555
Everybody inside!

00:56.557 --> 00:58.073
Hands up.

00:58.074 --> 00:59.590
¶ so just give it up
'cause you don't understand ¶

00:59.593 --> 01:01.760
Get down on the ground!
Get down on the ground!

01:03.697 --> 01:08.700
¶ 'cause you don't

01:08.702 --> 01:12.704
¶ your pretty world,

01:22.817 --> 01:26.718
¶ your pretty world,
pretty world gave ¶

01:26.720 --> 01:30.422
¶ pretty world,
pretty world gave ¶

01:30.424 --> 01:31.590
[knocking]

01:31.592 --> 01:32.724
You wanted to see me?

01:32.726 --> 01:34.293
Yeah. Have a seat.

01:37.231 --> 01:39.231
So the attorney general
has announced

01:39.233 --> 01:41.200
A first of its kind
comprehensive review

01:41.202 --> 01:43.368
Of every serial criminal
in federal prison.

01:43.370 --> 01:45.287
Ok.

01:45.288 --> 01:47.205
And he wants you to supervise
and coordinate the team.

01:47.208 --> 01:48.273
Oh.

01:48.275 --> 01:50.275
Congratulations.

01:50.277 --> 01:54.446
Uh...Um, I've--eh--

01:54.448 --> 01:56.782
I'm just gonna
hyperventilate
for a moment,

01:56.784 --> 01:58.217
So if I could
just have--

01:58.219 --> 02:00.285
[exhales]
ok, well--well, when?

02:00.287 --> 02:01.753
When--when
does he need it?

02:01.755 --> 02:04.289
It's ambitious.
He says it's all
gonna happen in a year

02:04.291 --> 02:06.258
And you'd need to start
immediately.

02:06.260 --> 02:08.293
You'd have to leave
the bau.

02:08.295 --> 02:10.729
No. Oh. I--

02:10.731 --> 02:12.331
No, I came here
for a reason.

02:12.333 --> 02:13.665
I love what we do.

02:13.667 --> 02:14.800
I don't want to leave.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.268
But it's a great opportunity.

02:16.269 --> 02:17.735
Why don't you take some time
to think about it?

02:17.738 --> 02:18.804
Garcia?
Don't go.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.305
I'm sorry, sir.
I wasn't--

02:20.307 --> 02:21.807
I wasn't eavesdropping.
Official business.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.642
What is that?

02:23.643 --> 02:25.476
Uh--oh, it's--
it's fresh off the wire.

02:25.479 --> 02:28.580
There's a single murder,
but they think
that single murder

02:28.582 --> 02:30.816
Is super significant because
the field office email

02:30.818 --> 02:32.184
Said "urgent" like 3 times.

02:32.186 --> 02:33.785
This is in glenport village.

02:33.787 --> 02:36.155
What's in glenport
village.

02:36.157 --> 02:40.626
Uh, glenport village
is a planned community
of sex offenders.

02:40.628 --> 02:43.795
I wrote the psychological
questionnaire that
reverend santos uses

02:43.797 --> 02:45.531
To choose the residents.

02:45.533 --> 02:48.433
Planned community
of sex offenders?
You're serious?

02:49.703 --> 02:52.838
Glenport village, florida,
houses a wide spectrum

02:52.840 --> 02:54.173
Of non-violent offenders,

02:54.175 --> 02:55.507
Crimes ranging
from statutory rape

02:55.509 --> 02:58.177
To public urination
in front of children.

02:58.179 --> 03:00.479
No rapists or murderers
until now.

03:00.481 --> 03:02.181
Well, I can tell you
one thing.

03:02.183 --> 03:04.816
Reverend santos
and his community
are dedicated to reform.

03:04.818 --> 03:07.920
It says here he went to jail
at 18 for impregnating

03:07.922 --> 03:10.589
His 15-year-old girlfriend.

03:10.590 --> 03:13.257
Yes, but no offenses
since and 40 years
and two children later,

03:13.260 --> 03:14.860
They're still
happily married.

03:14.862 --> 03:17.529
Am I reading this right?
Families with kids
live there?

03:17.531 --> 03:19.798
The law requires
sexual offenders
to live certain distances

03:19.800 --> 03:21.767
From bus stops,
playgrounds, and schools,

03:21.769 --> 03:23.535
But it says nothing
about being their neighbors.

03:23.537 --> 03:26.471
In most cities
that's a legal oversight,
but in this one,

03:26.473 --> 03:27.873
It was part
of the design plan

03:27.875 --> 03:30.375
Look, here's some context.
In 2009, reverend santos

03:30.377 --> 03:33.645
Was able to buy up
a few homes in barclay
bay using church funds.

03:33.647 --> 03:35.847
Now, the real estate
was already inexpensive
in this area,

03:35.849 --> 03:37.883
But when surrounding
residents found out

03:37.885 --> 03:39.918
That he planned
to house sex offenders,

03:39.920 --> 03:41.737
There was a mass exodus,

03:41.738 --> 03:43.555
So eventually
he was able to buy up
the rest of the homes

03:43.557 --> 03:44.856
And then rename the town.

03:44.858 --> 03:46.358
Will he cooperate
with us?

03:46.360 --> 03:48.360
He's already sending us
files on all the residents,

03:48.362 --> 03:49.528
Past and present.

03:49.530 --> 03:51.863
This community
is a fascinating
experiment.

03:51.865 --> 03:52.998
Typically
when sex offenders

03:53.000 --> 03:55.400
Try to reintegrate
into society,

03:55.402 --> 03:56.602
They're rejected,
they're isolated.

03:56.604 --> 03:58.904
But this community,
sick of the harassment,

03:58.906 --> 04:00.973
Decided to self-isolate.

04:00.975 --> 04:02.908
Well, that experiment
just backfired.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.544
Yeah, in a massive way.

04:05.546 --> 04:07.713
Two nights ago
authorities found

04:07.715 --> 04:09.881
The body of paige lincoln
in her bathroom.

04:09.883 --> 04:12.751
She was stabbed in
the chest and the stomach.

04:12.753 --> 04:15.420
Yeah, I'm just shocked
that the reverend
didn't call me immediately.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.022
Well, they had
a suspect right away--

04:17.024 --> 04:19.024
Her husband, kyle lincoln.

04:19.026 --> 04:20.592
He was covered in her blood,

04:20.594 --> 04:22.894
But his alibi checked out
this morning, and the blood

04:22.896 --> 04:24.930
Was because he was trying
to resuscitate her.

04:24.932 --> 04:27.599
And now we have
a two-day-old crime scene
and a town full of suspects.

04:27.601 --> 04:28.967
Wheels up in 30.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.909
It's all the way down
the block.

04:37.911 --> 04:40.579
What are you, scared?

04:40.581 --> 04:42.414
No.

04:42.416 --> 04:43.982
Yes, you are.

04:45.019 --> 04:47.319
Maggie, wait!

05:08.008 --> 05:09.508
Hey!

06:03.497 --> 06:05.664
Morgan: "I swear,
from the bottom of my heart,

06:05.666 --> 06:08.800
"I want to be healed,
I want to be like other men,

06:08.802 --> 06:11.670
Not this outcast
who nobody wants."

06:11.672 --> 06:13.756
E.M. Forster.

06:13.757 --> 06:15.841
The victim, paige lincoln,
was a high school teacher

06:15.843 --> 06:17.509
Caught making out
with a student.

06:17.511 --> 06:19.511
She moved to glenport
village shortly thereafter,

06:19.513 --> 06:21.980
Met her husband kyle,
who's an offender there,

06:21.982 --> 06:23.815
And by all accounts,
their marriage was stable.

06:23.817 --> 06:25.650
She was found in
a cheerleader outfit

06:25.652 --> 06:29.121
That according to her amazon
purchases, she bought.

06:29.123 --> 06:31.156
Must have been
her husband's fantasy.

06:31.158 --> 06:33.125
Well, according
to her history,
it could be hers.

06:33.127 --> 06:34.993
I mean, is that why
she was killed?

06:34.995 --> 06:36.695
Maybe she was having
an affair.

06:36.697 --> 06:38.697
Well, if paige
was looking for guys
who were into cheerleaders,

06:38.699 --> 06:40.665
This town was
a good place to start.

06:40.667 --> 06:43.001
I know this preacher, ok?
These aren't bad people.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.837
Just because this happened
here doesn't mean
a resident did it.

06:45.839 --> 06:48.006
We just need to keep
all of our options open.

06:48.008 --> 06:50.675
She's right. This isn't
a prison or military base.

06:50.677 --> 06:52.744
People move in and out
freely.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.713
What if this
was a vendetta kill

06:54.715 --> 06:56.648
Committed by a victim
of a glenport village
resident?

06:56.650 --> 06:58.083
Revenge is a good
motivator.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.851
Garcia's tracking
outside threats.

06:59.853 --> 07:02.721
When we land, lewis and I
will go talk to the reverend.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.823
Dave, you go to the m.E.

07:04.824 --> 07:06.924
Morgan, you and reid
go talk to paige's husband.

07:18.739 --> 07:21.706
Mr. Lincoln, we need
to ask you some
personal questions.

07:21.708 --> 07:24.209
Are you sure that
you're up to this?

07:24.211 --> 07:27.212
Yeah, it's fine. Just...

07:27.214 --> 07:29.748
Just get it over with.

07:30.951 --> 07:34.719
The cheerleader costume.
We know paige bought it.

07:34.721 --> 07:38.089
Was that role play
something that she
was into, or...

07:38.091 --> 07:40.225
No, I...

07:40.227 --> 07:41.760
It was my thing.

07:41.762 --> 07:43.228
Who else would have
known that?

07:43.230 --> 07:44.663
Nobody.

07:44.665 --> 07:46.231
Look, why is this
so important?

07:46.233 --> 07:49.768
The man who killed paige
dressed her up
before he took her life.

07:49.770 --> 07:54.806
So either he has
the same role playing
preference you do...

07:54.808 --> 07:56.775
Or he's trying
to frame you with it.

07:56.777 --> 07:58.977
Do you see where
we're going with this?

08:03.083 --> 08:06.751
Sometimes I'd...

08:06.753 --> 08:09.721
I'd want her to have it on
when I got home.

08:09.723 --> 08:14.559
I'd text her.
Only it wasn't a text,

08:14.561 --> 08:15.627
It was a...

08:15.629 --> 08:17.796
Internet relay chat.

08:17.798 --> 08:18.930
It's like a text, only--

08:18.932 --> 08:21.066
Irc self-deletes
when you close the window.

08:21.068 --> 08:22.601
Exactly.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.669
Why would you need
so much privacy?

08:25.806 --> 08:28.840
You haven't met
the reverend, have you?

08:33.113 --> 08:34.646
That's everyone, tara.

08:34.648 --> 08:37.883
All 1,922 citizens.

08:37.885 --> 08:40.952
You'll find case histories,
probationary reports,

08:40.954 --> 08:42.787
Hopefully everything
you need.

08:42.789 --> 08:45.290
Great. Thanks, reverend.

08:45.291 --> 08:47.792
I just wish we were
meeting again under
better circumstances.

08:47.794 --> 08:50.929
Did anyone have any issues
with the lincoln family,
reverend?

08:50.931 --> 08:54.833
No one has much trouble
with anyone here.

08:54.835 --> 08:55.967
Ever?

08:55.969 --> 08:57.969
I took your ideas

08:57.971 --> 08:59.871
And I instituted
a couple of my own.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.674
Ask the sheriff about
how successful we've been.

09:02.676 --> 09:04.309
Well, I'm surprised,
but he's right.

09:04.311 --> 09:05.844
20 years of police work,

09:05.846 --> 09:09.014
This is the quietest
beat I've ever had.

09:09.016 --> 09:11.816
How have you
accomplished that?

09:11.818 --> 09:13.852
There's an application
process?

09:13.854 --> 09:15.887
It's intense.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.189
And what happens
once you get in?

09:18.191 --> 09:21.192
The residents
all sign contracts.

09:21.194 --> 09:22.861
We're about
transparency.

09:22.863 --> 09:24.829
Reverend, we worked together
for 6 years with no issues.

09:24.831 --> 09:25.897
Why hide this?

09:25.899 --> 09:27.866
Paul, it's not personal,

09:27.868 --> 09:29.935
But we can self-police
better than you.

09:31.004 --> 09:33.572
What happened two nights ago
was a tragedy,

09:33.574 --> 09:36.575
But it's also the first
violent crime in 6 years.

09:36.577 --> 09:39.244
That's well below the
national average, I believe.

09:39.246 --> 09:42.080
Exactly what do residents
agree to in these contracts?

09:42.082 --> 09:43.915
It's a tracking chip.

09:46.753 --> 09:49.187
It's surgically implanted.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.156
And the reverend
makes you wear it?

09:52.893 --> 09:55.927
Hiding a contract
from me is one thing,
but a tracker?

09:55.929 --> 09:58.029
That does seem extreme,
reverend.

09:58.031 --> 09:59.898
Nobody's coerced.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.766
If they don't like it,
they can leave.

10:01.768 --> 10:03.168
Can the chip be removed?

10:03.170 --> 10:06.371
Yes, and if they try
without my approval,
I'm notified.

10:06.373 --> 10:08.340
But that's
never happened.

10:08.342 --> 10:09.874
Do you have one?

10:09.876 --> 10:11.676
Don't need it.

10:11.678 --> 10:13.612
My incident
was decades ago.

10:13.614 --> 10:17.115
Look, if a resident
lives here without
trouble for 5 years,

10:17.117 --> 10:18.917
I take theirs out as well.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.419
A contract. A tracker.

10:20.420 --> 10:21.920
That's quite the secret
playbook, reverend.

10:21.922 --> 10:24.623
Everything is done
in the name
our our protection.

10:24.625 --> 10:27.926
How accurate is the gps
on those trackers?

10:27.928 --> 10:29.694
It's down to 3 feet.

10:29.696 --> 10:31.997
That data's a good
starting point.

10:31.999 --> 10:33.832
We could begin with
the whereabouts
of every resident

10:33.834 --> 10:35.884
In the community
with a tracker.

10:35.885 --> 10:37.935
Who was in the lincoln house
the night of the murder,
reverend?

10:37.938 --> 10:40.739
I've been working on that
since you landed.

10:40.741 --> 10:43.308
C.O.D was exsanguination

10:43.310 --> 10:45.910
Caused by stab wounds
to the abdomen and chest.

10:45.912 --> 10:47.412
Hell of a lot of overkill.

10:47.414 --> 10:49.914
This looks personal.
Defensive wounds?

10:49.916 --> 10:51.416
Across her palms
and forearms.

10:51.418 --> 10:52.917
Any hesitation marks?

10:52.919 --> 10:53.918
None.

10:53.920 --> 10:55.954
It's probably not
his first time.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.255
What about sexual assault?

10:57.257 --> 10:58.923
No obvious signs.

10:58.925 --> 11:01.960
If he's in codis,
he might not risk it.

11:01.962 --> 11:03.728
The costume is covered
in the victim's blood,

11:03.730 --> 11:06.798
But there aren't any
knife perforations
in the fabric.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.100
So he dressed her
postmortem.

11:09.102 --> 11:10.969
Yes.

11:10.971 --> 11:13.038
This unsub needs
a compliant victim

11:13.040 --> 11:15.173
To proceed with his fantasy.

11:15.175 --> 11:19.044
The problem is,
a live one isn't.

11:23.884 --> 11:26.851
All right, thanks, lewis.

11:26.853 --> 11:30.088
Randy nelson,
the lincolns' neighbor.

11:30.090 --> 11:32.457
He seems to be
the only one in the house
that day with a tracker.

11:32.459 --> 11:34.826
According to the reverend,
he's here for flashing
married women.

11:34.828 --> 11:36.461
Paige fits that
victimology.

11:36.463 --> 11:40.098
The question is,
would randy dress her
as a cheerleader?

11:40.100 --> 11:43.001
Let's take him in
and find out.

11:43.003 --> 11:46.237
[sheriff, indistinct]

11:46.239 --> 11:50.075
Here's some money.
Bring back the change,
all right?

11:50.077 --> 11:52.210
Oh, agent hotchner.
Danny, come here.

11:52.212 --> 11:55.013
These are my kids.
This is riley.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.214
Hi.
Hi, riley.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.315
And this is danny.

11:57.317 --> 11:58.817
Danny.
How do you do?

11:58.819 --> 11:59.984
Can we go now?

11:59.986 --> 12:01.286
Yeah, sure.

12:01.288 --> 12:03.321
Riley, straight home
after you finish shopping,

12:03.323 --> 12:04.723
I know.
All right, riley?

12:04.725 --> 12:06.491
Sorry about that.

12:06.493 --> 12:08.760
It hasn't been easy.

12:08.761 --> 12:11.028
They, uh, they came here
after my ex-wife passed

12:11.031 --> 12:12.330
6 months ago.

12:12.332 --> 12:13.498
You got kids?

12:13.500 --> 12:15.500
One. A 10-year-old boy.

12:15.502 --> 12:17.135
Oh, I'm in over my head.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.270
We live 5 miles
outside of glenport village,

12:19.272 --> 12:22.340
But the place still informs
every parental decision I make.

12:22.342 --> 12:23.408
Sure.

12:26.480 --> 12:28.947
Especially
on a day like this.

12:30.016 --> 12:32.050
This place sucks.

12:32.052 --> 12:33.852
First we move into my dad's
so late in the year

12:33.854 --> 12:35.186
That I miss cheer tryouts,

12:35.188 --> 12:37.021
Then the ap chem is boring.

12:37.023 --> 12:39.758
Southville is the worst.

12:39.760 --> 12:43.094
I like it. I mean,
I get to play soccer.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.095
And dad's here.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.114
God, you're so simple.

12:46.115 --> 12:48.132
No, I get it.
I mean, you miss
your old neighborhood.

12:48.135 --> 12:49.534
You have no idea.

12:49.536 --> 12:50.535
No offense.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.771
No, no, none taken.

12:52.773 --> 12:56.174
So, I, um, I heard
about this party
tonight at greg's.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.909
I--I can get us in.

12:57.911 --> 12:59.811
You can get us in?

12:59.813 --> 13:02.113
Probably.
I mean, I'll try.

13:02.115 --> 13:05.183
Oh, it's not gonna matter
'cause my dad won't let me go.

13:05.185 --> 13:07.218
Well, why not?

13:07.220 --> 13:09.120
Look who the neighbors are.

13:12.559 --> 13:14.826
Lewis: You were friends
with paige?

13:14.828 --> 13:16.227
I was, yes.

13:16.229 --> 13:18.029
Morgan: For how long.

13:18.031 --> 13:21.099
Years. 3, maybe, yeah.

13:21.101 --> 13:24.502
She was the only one
in glenport village
who was nice to me.

13:24.504 --> 13:26.137
How come?

13:26.139 --> 13:29.240
That's just how it is,
even in a town like this.

13:29.242 --> 13:32.310
Randy, come have a seat.

13:32.312 --> 13:35.146
Make yourself comfortable.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.315
You're not under arrest.

13:39.953 --> 13:42.587
Here's the thing, randy.

13:42.589 --> 13:45.190
The guy who did this,

13:45.192 --> 13:47.125
He was into cheerleaders.

13:47.127 --> 13:49.527
Well, I'm not.

13:49.529 --> 13:54.165
Maybe the killer
just wants us
to believe that he is.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.868
I don't know
about any of this.

13:56.870 --> 13:59.971
You were in paige's house
at 3 p.M. That afternoon.

13:59.973 --> 14:03.241
You have a history
with housewives.

14:03.243 --> 14:05.276
But here's the strange thing.

14:05.278 --> 14:08.313
Our analyst went through
your internet history.

14:08.315 --> 14:11.115
Not a single trace of porn,

14:11.117 --> 14:12.851
Of any kind.

14:12.853 --> 14:15.987
The others use it
as a safety valve,

14:15.989 --> 14:18.022
A way to release pressure.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.991
I manage fine without that.

14:19.993 --> 14:23.161
Morgan: Well, it's possible.
Or maybe you're just
better at hiding it.

14:23.163 --> 14:25.864
No, you're wrong.

14:27.267 --> 14:30.101
My life's an open book.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.003
You're looking at it.

14:32.005 --> 14:36.641
Randy, what I'm
looking at is each of
the women you flashed...

14:36.643 --> 14:38.243
Were mothers.

14:38.245 --> 14:40.979
And each of them
was in the company

14:40.981 --> 14:44.449
Of their grade-school-age
son when you did it.

14:44.451 --> 14:49.320
Now, that school bus
drops off tommy gannon
every afternoon.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.656
He lives right next door
to paige,

14:51.658 --> 14:53.324
And he's 8 years old.

14:53.326 --> 14:57.228
That's why you go over
for coffee, isn't it,

14:57.230 --> 14:59.264
To watch him.

15:01.167 --> 15:03.301
No. Absolutely not.

15:03.303 --> 15:07.672
Randy, those women
were never your targets.

15:07.674 --> 15:09.274
Their children were.

15:09.276 --> 15:13.177
And if the reverend
finds out that
you're a pedophile,

15:13.179 --> 15:16.314
You can't live here anymore.

15:16.316 --> 15:19.217
And that is why paige
was your only friend,

15:19.219 --> 15:24.255
Because you couldn't
afford to let anybody else
know what you were into.

15:26.159 --> 15:28.693
I tried to stop.

15:28.695 --> 15:31.362
Please, I'm sorry.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.665
Randy,

15:33.667 --> 15:36.134
We have to tell the reverend
and the sheriff about this.

15:36.136 --> 15:39.270
No. No, please.

15:41.975 --> 15:43.708
What do you two
want for dinner tonight?

15:43.710 --> 15:45.576
I don't know.

15:45.578 --> 15:46.711
Danny?
Burgers!

15:46.713 --> 15:49.247
No, gross, we had
burgers twice this week.

15:49.249 --> 15:51.950
Ah, well, maybe I'll do up
them potatoes y'all like?

15:51.952 --> 15:52.951
Dad.

15:52.953 --> 15:54.218
What? Last summer
you loved them.

15:54.220 --> 15:55.253
No, it's fine.

15:55.255 --> 15:56.387
I still like them.

15:56.389 --> 15:57.722
Here you go.

15:57.724 --> 16:00.258
Why don't we just
order a pizza or something?

16:00.260 --> 16:01.559
Danny, is that ok
with you?

16:01.561 --> 16:02.560
Yeah, fine.

16:02.562 --> 16:03.561
You have homework
tonight?

16:03.563 --> 16:04.729
Ap chem.

16:04.731 --> 16:06.731
Danny: Book report.

16:06.733 --> 16:07.732
Hey, matt!

16:07.734 --> 16:08.733
Sheriff.

16:08.735 --> 16:10.234
Hey, riley,
will you, uh,

16:10.236 --> 16:13.271
Will you look over
danny's work tonight?

16:13.273 --> 16:14.472
Sure.

16:16.576 --> 16:18.743
[alarm beeping]

16:20.347 --> 16:22.347
So, dad...

16:22.349 --> 16:26.150
Um, there's this party
tonight.

16:26.152 --> 16:27.352
Uh-huh.

16:27.354 --> 16:30.054
Everybody will be there.
Can I go?

16:30.056 --> 16:31.055
Where is it?

16:31.057 --> 16:32.290
Not far.

16:32.291 --> 16:33.524
But like in the total
opposite direction

16:33.526 --> 16:36.194
From glenport village.

16:36.196 --> 16:37.428
Ok.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.063
Danny: What?!
What?!

16:39.065 --> 16:40.098
But you can't leave
until I'm back
from my rounds.

16:40.099 --> 16:41.132
Someone needs to be
here with danny.

16:41.134 --> 16:42.633
Yeah, ok.

16:42.635 --> 16:44.068
And home by 10:30.

16:44.070 --> 16:45.403
Whoo!

16:45.405 --> 16:46.738
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

16:46.740 --> 16:48.673
Yeah.
You're the best dad ever.

16:50.710 --> 16:54.145
You let her do
anything she wants.

16:54.147 --> 16:57.015
Hey, didn't I let you
play video games

16:57.017 --> 16:58.016
This morning before school?

16:58.018 --> 16:59.751
Yeah.

16:59.752 --> 17:01.485
So finish your homework.
You can play more tonight, ok?

17:01.488 --> 17:03.721
Ok.

17:09.195 --> 17:11.429
[giggling]

17:11.431 --> 17:13.064
See you later.

17:13.066 --> 17:14.232
Bye, victoria.

17:14.234 --> 17:15.600
Bye, vickie.

17:18.204 --> 17:21.205
[heavy breathing]

17:28.648 --> 17:30.581
[knocking]

17:33.720 --> 17:35.520
[screaming]

17:44.264 --> 17:45.496
Here name's victoria taylor.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.298
She was a senior
at cove high.

17:47.300 --> 17:50.668
An honor student
and cheerleader.

17:52.639 --> 17:55.706
Sorry, my, uh, daughter
went to a football game

17:55.708 --> 17:58.109
At their school last week.

17:59.479 --> 18:02.480
She was killed in uniform.
No postmortem dressing.

18:02.482 --> 18:05.316
Different victimology.
Different m.O.

18:05.318 --> 18:07.085
We got two killers here?

18:07.087 --> 18:09.720
What if the unsub's
showing his true colors?

18:09.722 --> 18:14.325
Paige was the surrogate,
victoria his ideal.

18:14.327 --> 18:18.096
One he probably spent
weeks trying to find.

18:18.098 --> 18:21.165
Location also narrows
down our suspect pool.

18:21.167 --> 18:22.333
How do you figure?

18:22.335 --> 18:24.368
We're 10 miles
from glenport village.

18:24.370 --> 18:26.737
That eliminates anyone
with a tracking device.

18:26.739 --> 18:29.240
Sheriff,
round up your men.

18:29.242 --> 18:32.443
We're ready to deliver
the profile.

18:32.445 --> 18:35.379
Lewis: Based on the age
of everyone without a chip,

18:35.381 --> 18:38.216
We are searching for
a man in his late 30s
to early 40s.

18:38.218 --> 18:40.518
In addition to them,
we're also looking
at residents

18:40.520 --> 18:42.353
From nearby communities.

18:42.355 --> 18:44.489
Regardless of location,
this unsub is experienced,

18:44.491 --> 18:46.491
Organized, and worst of all,
he is patient.

18:46.493 --> 18:50.228
He has practiced
extreme self-control
to sublimate his desires.

18:50.230 --> 18:53.397
Frequent precursor
crimes to this kind
of fetishized murder

18:53.399 --> 18:55.466
Include peeping
and petty larceny

18:55.468 --> 18:58.236
Of object
like undergarments.

18:58.238 --> 19:00.371
Morgan: Now, this guy's
probably fantasized
and obsessed

19:00.373 --> 19:02.240
Over these murders
for years.

19:02.242 --> 19:04.742
Now that he's gotten
a taste, he's gonna
want to keep killing

19:04.744 --> 19:06.544
And will take increased
risks to do so.

19:06.546 --> 19:09.247
Lewis: As is evidenced
by another murder on
the heels of the first

19:09.249 --> 19:11.682
And under the nose
of police and
federal investigators.

19:11.684 --> 19:14.252
This guy gets off
on the thrill
as much as the killing.

19:14.254 --> 19:17.255
125 residents have had
their chips removed,

19:17.257 --> 19:20.258
But remember, it's
possible that the unsub
is not from here.

19:20.260 --> 19:22.727
Our analyst is
searching for suspects
outside of the community.

19:22.729 --> 19:25.897
With your help
we'll be interviewing those
residents without trackers.

19:25.899 --> 19:27.732
Thank you.

19:34.574 --> 19:37.542
I hear you have
a big decision to make.

19:37.544 --> 19:40.912
Yeah. One of the biggest
of my life.

19:40.914 --> 19:43.548
Once a year,
on my birthday,

19:43.550 --> 19:46.184
I go visit this killer
in prison.

19:46.186 --> 19:49.487
His idea, not mine,
believe me.

19:49.489 --> 19:53.524
He's the only one
who knows where
the bodies are buried.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.293
He gives me a name,

19:55.295 --> 19:59.730
And I give a family
some peace and closure.

19:59.732 --> 20:03.401
But every time
I sit across from him,

20:03.403 --> 20:06.571
Treating him
like a human being,

20:06.573 --> 20:08.839
It takes something
out of me.

20:11.511 --> 20:14.745
You can do something
I can't do.

20:14.747 --> 20:19.650
I think that's why
the brass tapped you
for this project.

20:22.622 --> 20:25.489
It takes something
out of me, too.

20:26.960 --> 20:29.393
The scary thing is,

20:29.395 --> 20:31.395
Sometimes I don't
even notice it

20:31.397 --> 20:34.699
Till long after it's gone.

20:36.970 --> 20:39.971
You know, this job
ain't all milk and honey.

20:39.973 --> 20:41.472
Some days you lose.

20:41.474 --> 20:44.842
Some days you do things
you don't want to do.

20:44.844 --> 20:47.979
So ask yourself this--

20:47.981 --> 20:50.648
Where can you do
the most good

20:50.650 --> 20:53.851
And still do yourself
the least harm?

20:53.853 --> 20:57.688
Then make your decision.

21:05.398 --> 21:06.664
My whole life
is here, man.

21:06.666 --> 21:09.634
I got no reason
to leave,
except for my job.

21:09.636 --> 21:12.670
You recently missed
several days of work.
Why was that?

21:12.672 --> 21:14.605
Got doctors.

21:14.607 --> 21:17.675
Back doctor, knee doctor,
neck doctor.

21:17.677 --> 21:22.346
[sighs] poked and prodded
all damn day.

21:22.348 --> 21:26.817
And I got the paperwork
and the needle marks
to prove it.

21:26.819 --> 21:29.620
So, where were you
the last two nights?

21:29.622 --> 21:30.921
I was at home.

21:30.923 --> 21:33.858
Are those blundstones?

21:33.860 --> 21:35.860
Yes, they are.

21:35.862 --> 21:38.696
Anybody to confirm
your whereabouts?

21:38.698 --> 21:41.699
My mom.
Do you wear an e?

21:41.701 --> 21:44.502
How about I boot you
in the ass

21:44.504 --> 21:46.671
And then you can tell me.

21:50.643 --> 21:54.545
Those are copies
of my receipts
for the last week.

21:54.547 --> 21:58.049
Restaurant, pharmacy.

21:58.051 --> 22:00.518
Nothing exciting.

22:02.588 --> 22:05.056
It's gone, isn't it?

22:05.058 --> 22:06.691
What is?

22:06.693 --> 22:08.492
Our home.

22:08.494 --> 22:11.062
We can't stay.

22:11.064 --> 22:14.932
And there's nowhere else
we can build
something like this.

22:14.934 --> 22:16.567
Reverend, when we find
the guy did this--

22:16.569 --> 22:18.569
It doesn't matter.

22:18.570 --> 22:20.570
You know, we had 16
protests here last year?

22:20.573 --> 22:22.573
Parents come by,
yell at us

22:22.575 --> 22:24.909
And throw rocks
through the windows.

22:24.911 --> 22:27.678
But they don't know
these men and women
the way I do,

22:27.680 --> 22:29.347
The way you do.

22:29.349 --> 22:33.551
Nobody here did this,
but they won't believe that.

22:33.553 --> 22:35.753
Now our home is gone.

22:35.755 --> 22:39.690
No. No, after this
is all over, you can rebuild.

22:39.692 --> 22:42.626
What if I was wrong
about everything?

22:42.628 --> 22:46.397
I mean, in building this,
I made us easier targets?

22:46.399 --> 22:51.669
Reverend, without you,
these people would have
nowhere to go.

22:51.671 --> 22:54.605
And if it hadn't
been for me,

22:54.607 --> 22:58.509
Paige would still be alive.

22:59.846 --> 23:01.645
Garcia: Al the residents
checked out, didn't they?

23:01.647 --> 23:04.582
Every single one,
with or without
the tracking chip.

23:04.584 --> 23:06.717
Ok. Where does that leave us?

23:06.719 --> 23:09.120
You know, the reverend
said something
that go me thinking.

23:09.122 --> 23:12.957
This town is the perfect
forensic countermeasure.

23:12.959 --> 23:15.626
The unsub would have known
we'd start investigating
inside the circle,

23:15.628 --> 23:17.061
And that's exactly
what we did.

23:17.063 --> 23:18.629
To take advantage of that,

23:18.631 --> 23:20.798
This guy would have to be
an outsider.

23:20.800 --> 23:23.067
Yeah. Garcia,
how are you doing
investigating people

23:23.069 --> 23:25.035
In the surrounding
communities?

23:25.037 --> 23:27.138
Well, it's still
in its early stages.

23:27.140 --> 23:28.806
The list is long and
rather arduous.

23:28.808 --> 23:30.975
It's no big shocker,
there's a lot of people
out there

23:30.977 --> 23:32.777
Who have vendettas
against glenport village.

23:32.779 --> 23:34.745
All right, there is one name
that keeps cropping up.

23:34.747 --> 23:38.048
Ira stein. He lives
right by glenport village.

23:38.050 --> 23:41.185
He has been quite vocal
about his dislike
of the community.

23:41.187 --> 23:43.187
He's been arrested twice
for harassing residents.

23:43.189 --> 23:46.056
I'll go talk to ira.
Thanks.

23:46.058 --> 23:47.825
While you do,
we need to take
another look.

23:47.827 --> 23:49.693
There's something
or someone we missed.

23:49.695 --> 23:50.995
Sheriff, can you
give us a hand?

23:50.997 --> 23:54.732
Of course. One second,
agent lewis. Hey, guys.

23:54.734 --> 23:57.601
Dad, can one of the deputies
show me how to fire a gun?

23:57.603 --> 24:00.838
We'll see, buddy.
Come on.

24:03.843 --> 24:05.709
What are we doing here?

24:05.711 --> 24:07.711
'cause we're all spending
the night in my office.

24:07.713 --> 24:08.846
I call couch!

24:08.848 --> 24:09.847
What? Why?

24:09.849 --> 24:11.182
Dad, what about the party?

24:11.184 --> 24:12.616
I'm sorry, riley.

24:12.618 --> 24:16.053
That is so unfair.
You told me I could go.

24:16.055 --> 24:19.190
Hey, danny, why don't you,
uh, get yourself some food

24:19.192 --> 24:20.724
From the vending machine.

24:20.726 --> 24:22.993
Sure.

24:24.997 --> 24:28.532
Victoria taylor--
you know her?

24:28.534 --> 24:31.168
No. But I heard.

24:31.170 --> 24:33.704
I need to make sure
you two are safe.

24:33.706 --> 24:36.907
So you're making me and danny
literally rot in a prison?

24:36.909 --> 24:38.909
Come on, riley.
It's one night,

24:38.911 --> 24:41.245
And I need you to watch
over your brother.

24:41.247 --> 24:43.714
Dad, this is insane.

24:43.716 --> 24:45.749
Our house is a fortress.
I mean, there are more guns

24:45.751 --> 24:47.551
At home than there are here.

24:47.553 --> 24:50.721
Besides, you know
someone from perville
did this.

24:50.723 --> 24:52.756
No, I don't.
Not necessarily.

24:52.758 --> 24:54.225
All I know for sure
is whoever this is

24:54.227 --> 24:57.495
Has gone outside
glenport village.

24:57.497 --> 25:01.599
Now, please, riley,
help me do my job, ok?

25:01.601 --> 25:03.734
Just one night.

25:03.736 --> 25:06.170
Fine.

25:14.947 --> 25:15.946
Hey, adam.

25:15.948 --> 25:17.615
Adam: Hey, can you go out?

25:17.617 --> 25:19.817
No. I'm at my dad's work.

25:19.819 --> 25:22.052
Oh. Well, we, uh,
we got invited
to greg's party.

25:22.054 --> 25:23.053
We did?

25:23.055 --> 25:24.054
[sighs]

25:24.056 --> 25:25.856
My dad's got me
on lockdown.

25:25.858 --> 25:27.958
Doubt it.
Can you sneak out?

25:27.960 --> 25:29.894
Doesn't matter.
I don't have a car.

25:29.896 --> 25:31.228
Oh, I'll pick you up.

25:31.230 --> 25:32.863
You will?

25:32.865 --> 25:36.934
Yeah, of course.
Just meet me outside
the station in 20.

25:36.936 --> 25:38.769
Ok.

25:38.771 --> 25:40.170
Hey, danny.

25:40.172 --> 25:41.939
Dad says you can't go.

25:41.941 --> 25:44.808
I'll only be gone an hour.
Two, max.

25:44.810 --> 25:46.844
My silence isn't free.

25:46.846 --> 25:49.146
How much?

25:49.148 --> 25:51.916
Two weeks
with your computer.

25:52.952 --> 25:55.619
Rossi hit a dead end
with ira stein,

25:55.621 --> 25:57.221
The the reverend
said it himself--

25:57.222 --> 25:58.822
The reason the crime rate
is so low in glenport village

25:58.824 --> 26:00.558
Is because the people
there self-police.

26:00.560 --> 26:02.293
So someone there had to
have seen the unsub.

26:02.295 --> 26:04.895
Well, wouldn't they
come forward for the
good of the community?

26:04.897 --> 26:07.565
The residents are like us.
They watch, they profile.

26:07.567 --> 26:09.884
The thing is, they didn't
realize they saw him.

26:09.885 --> 26:12.202
Well, in that case,
who's the most likely
resident that did?

26:15.675 --> 26:17.708
I have an idea.

26:19.645 --> 26:21.645
Thanks for coming to get me.

26:21.647 --> 26:23.147
I felt like the walls
were closing in.

26:23.149 --> 26:25.215
Yeah, no problem.

26:27.153 --> 26:28.852
Wasn't that greg's?

26:28.854 --> 26:30.854
Yeah. Looks like
there's no party.

26:30.856 --> 26:32.690
Hmm. Maybe he got busted.

26:32.692 --> 26:35.859
You know, uh,
that's ok, 'cause,

26:35.861 --> 26:37.861
You know, I was thinking
that maybe...

26:37.863 --> 26:40.931
Uh...You know, I should
probably just get back
to my dad's work.

26:40.933 --> 26:43.334
No, that's ok, we're cool.

26:43.336 --> 26:45.235
Damn it, adam!

26:46.339 --> 26:49.640
Look, just take me
back to the station--now.

26:51.844 --> 26:55.279
You know what?
You can walk home.

26:55.281 --> 26:56.914
Are you kidding me?

26:56.916 --> 26:58.849
Get out.

26:58.851 --> 27:00.951
Get out!

27:22.041 --> 27:25.009
Where's your sister?

27:25.011 --> 27:26.276
She left.

27:26.278 --> 27:28.412
What, she left?!

27:28.414 --> 27:31.682
She said she'd be back
in an hour.

27:31.684 --> 27:33.984
Two, max.

27:35.388 --> 27:37.921
[voicemail] riley's phone,
leave a message.

27:37.923 --> 27:40.958
Danny, don't you move,
all right?

27:51.003 --> 27:52.936
Hey, riley.

27:52.938 --> 27:54.772
Hey, matt, is that you?

27:54.774 --> 27:56.173
Yeah. What's going on?

27:56.175 --> 27:59.009
Uh, greg's party
got broken up.

27:59.011 --> 28:02.780
Oh, well, you know,
there was an after party
at michelle's.

28:02.782 --> 28:05.783
Um, heh, sorry you missed it.

28:05.785 --> 28:07.951
Hey, you need a ride?

28:08.921 --> 28:12.189
Uh...Yeah.

28:19.031 --> 28:21.799
Uh, sorry,
the seatbelt's broken.

28:21.801 --> 28:24.768
Oh, no worries.
We're not going far.

28:24.770 --> 28:27.705
[sighs] I never should have
left the station.

28:27.707 --> 28:28.739
My dad's gonna be mad.

28:28.741 --> 28:31.108
Thanks for taking me back.

28:31.110 --> 28:33.744
Oh, uh, actually,
the station's that way.

28:33.746 --> 28:35.112
Oh, I know.

28:35.114 --> 28:36.480
[speeds up]

28:36.482 --> 28:38.449
Yeah, but it's the other way.

28:40.853 --> 28:42.386
Matt?

28:42.388 --> 28:43.420
[brakes screech]

28:43.422 --> 28:44.488
Oh!

29:03.075 --> 29:05.909
Randy: No, you're wrong,
I didn't see anybody.

29:07.513 --> 29:10.914
Agent, I need your help.

29:10.916 --> 29:13.751
Sure.

29:13.753 --> 29:18.155
Randy, you were the last
person to see paige alive.

29:18.157 --> 29:20.324
Yes.

29:20.326 --> 29:22.226
Ok.

29:22.228 --> 29:24.428
So take me through your day.

29:24.430 --> 29:28.165
Tommy's bus dropped him off
after school.

29:28.167 --> 29:30.934
You watched him
through paige's window.

29:30.936 --> 29:32.436
Then what happened?

29:32.438 --> 29:34.304
I walked back home.

29:34.306 --> 29:38.909
Ok. What did you do then?

29:38.911 --> 29:43.413
Sometimes tommy plays outside...

29:45.017 --> 29:49.019
And I, uh, get a good look
at him.

29:49.021 --> 29:51.889
He doesn't have any friends.

29:51.891 --> 29:55.425
It's not his fault.

29:55.427 --> 29:59.429
Who'd let their child
come over for a playdate
in glenport village?

29:59.431 --> 30:02.966
Tommy must be lonely.

30:02.968 --> 30:05.903
Did he come outside
that day?

30:07.907 --> 30:09.724
No.

30:09.725 --> 30:11.542
You would have been
hyper-focused

30:11.544 --> 30:14.211
On looking for him,
so any movement

30:14.213 --> 30:16.313
Would have caught
your eye.

30:16.315 --> 30:18.382
What did you see?

30:18.384 --> 30:20.384
Just a car.

30:20.386 --> 30:22.186
What kind of car?

30:23.923 --> 30:27.491
I don't know.
It's just a car.

30:27.493 --> 30:30.394
Play it over
in your mind slowly.

30:30.396 --> 30:34.264
Is there anything about
the car that stood out?

30:36.235 --> 30:37.968
It was gray.

30:37.970 --> 30:43.273
There, uh, there was
a sign on the side of it.

30:43.275 --> 30:46.310
Like a delivery car.

30:46.312 --> 30:48.412
The sign read "brain gang."

30:48.414 --> 30:52.950
It was one of those guys
that comes to your house
to fix your computers.

30:52.952 --> 30:56.086
Randy...

30:56.088 --> 30:57.621
That could be our unsub.

31:41.300 --> 31:43.901
Matt?

31:43.903 --> 31:47.537
No, no, no,
how did you find...

31:47.539 --> 31:51.008
Ok, you keep it in a bag
on a hanger in your closet.

31:52.111 --> 31:54.411
Why are you doing this?

31:57.583 --> 32:01.084
Searching for I.T. Service
reps who make house calls

32:01.086 --> 32:03.453
In glenport village.
Give me more.

32:03.455 --> 32:05.489
Set your search
parameters at 35 to 40

32:05.491 --> 32:07.491
And see who's working
glenport village.

32:07.493 --> 32:09.993
Those are some bang-up
parameters, brain brother.

32:09.995 --> 32:13.030
Checking, checking, and...

32:13.032 --> 32:15.349
Nothing.

32:15.350 --> 32:17.667
Which ones overlap with
victoria's neighborhood?

32:17.670 --> 32:20.170
Second verse same
as the first. Sorry.

32:20.172 --> 32:21.505
Maybe it's not
one of those guys.

32:21.507 --> 32:23.540
What if randy was wrong?

32:23.542 --> 32:25.342
The details down to the color
were highly specific.

32:25.344 --> 32:27.044
I mean, it's possible
our profile's wrong...

32:27.046 --> 32:29.179
The age--aren't I.T. Reps
usually younger?

32:29.181 --> 32:32.115
Garcia, new age
parameters. 18 to 25.

32:32.117 --> 32:33.400
I am in your headspace.

32:33.401 --> 32:34.684
And I like what I see.
I have 4 gentlemen

32:34.687 --> 32:37.204
That match those parameters.

32:37.205 --> 32:39.722
There's dave ermini,
tyler otte, matt franks, and--

32:39.725 --> 32:41.358
Wait, hold on.
Matt--matt franks?

32:41.360 --> 32:42.359
What is it?

32:42.361 --> 32:44.161
He's my next-door neighbor.

32:44.163 --> 32:45.729
He worked on my computer
last week.

32:45.731 --> 32:47.431
He's been in my house.

32:47.432 --> 32:49.132
We profiled increased
risk-taking behavior.

32:49.134 --> 32:51.535
5 years ago in georgia,
matt franks was arrested

32:51.537 --> 32:54.137
For stalking a girl
in high school, a cheerleader.

32:54.139 --> 32:56.440
Charges were dropped.
She left town.

32:56.442 --> 32:59.543
Two years after that,
franks was brought in
for questioning

32:59.545 --> 33:02.479
Regarding the murder
of another teen,
also a cheerleader,

33:02.481 --> 33:04.247
But detectives didn't have
enough evidence on him.

33:04.249 --> 33:06.450
Lewis,
get morgan and go.

33:06.452 --> 33:09.353
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on for a second.

33:09.355 --> 33:10.554
What are we looking at here?

33:10.556 --> 33:12.055
Tell me, father to father.

33:12.057 --> 33:13.724
These agents are the best.

33:13.726 --> 33:15.525
In case matt and riley
aren't there,

33:15.527 --> 33:18.395
I will stay behind here
and coordinate.

33:21.100 --> 33:23.200
Why am I doing this?

33:23.202 --> 33:25.102
Hmm...

33:25.104 --> 33:27.137
Same question
the other girls asked.

33:27.139 --> 33:30.040
Um...

33:30.042 --> 33:32.709
There's no cure for me.

33:32.711 --> 33:35.579
All right? And there's
no cure for those guys

33:35.581 --> 33:38.515
Over in glenport village
either.

33:38.517 --> 33:41.018
The other girls?

33:42.121 --> 33:47.724
With the first ones,
I was so impatient.

33:47.726 --> 33:51.428
I mean, the woman
in glenport was just...

33:51.430 --> 33:53.363
Too old,

33:53.365 --> 33:58.335
And, um, victoria--

33:58.337 --> 34:01.138
Victoria did it all wrong.

34:01.140 --> 34:04.241
But, um,

34:04.243 --> 34:06.777
Let's hope
that you get it right.

34:06.779 --> 34:09.146
I will.

34:09.148 --> 34:12.149
I will.

34:12.151 --> 34:14.284
Just...

34:14.286 --> 34:17.788
Not here.

34:17.790 --> 34:19.823
Let's go to the bedroom.

35:11.677 --> 35:13.343
Here we are.

35:13.345 --> 35:16.379
Yeah. We're gonna
have fun tonight.

35:20.352 --> 35:22.419
Yes, we are.

35:30.562 --> 35:33.697
So, what's first?

35:36.668 --> 35:38.735
Do your routine.

35:41.607 --> 35:43.840
I need my pom poms.

35:43.842 --> 35:46.343
Well, where are they?

35:46.345 --> 35:50.647
They're just
in the closet.

35:50.649 --> 35:54.718
Stop. Why are your pom poms
in your dad's closet?

35:56.255 --> 35:58.321
Uhh!

35:59.558 --> 36:01.658
Ah! Uh!

36:01.660 --> 36:02.659
Let me go!

36:02.661 --> 36:04.461
Let me go! No!

36:04.463 --> 36:05.729
Come on!

36:05.731 --> 36:08.265
Come on!

36:08.267 --> 36:09.799
Ohh...No!

36:09.801 --> 36:11.301
Shut up!

36:11.303 --> 36:15.305
[sirens]

36:15.307 --> 36:16.606
No, no.

36:16.608 --> 36:18.275
No, no, no!

36:18.277 --> 36:19.709
[grunts]

36:19.711 --> 36:22.379
Lewis, we'll take the front,
deputies take the back.

36:22.381 --> 36:24.848
There's a side door.
Hopefully he didn't
see it. Here's the keys.

36:24.850 --> 36:27.484
There's also
a combination lock.
It's 22-10-13.

36:27.486 --> 36:28.485
[riley screams]

36:28.487 --> 36:29.819
Sheriff, sheriff!
No!

36:29.821 --> 36:31.888
Back up.
Let us do this.

36:38.964 --> 36:40.797
[muffled cries,
struggling]

36:40.799 --> 36:42.666
Ow!

36:44.203 --> 36:45.368
You ruined everything.

36:45.370 --> 36:46.670
Please! Please!

36:46.672 --> 36:47.938
Matt franks, fbi!

36:47.940 --> 36:51.741
Lewis: Matt, we're going
to talk through this, ok?

36:51.743 --> 36:54.844
Talk? Talk about what?

36:54.846 --> 36:56.580
Whatever you like.

36:56.582 --> 36:58.715
I'm trained to listen.

36:58.717 --> 37:02.285
So, why don't we start
with your parents.

37:02.287 --> 37:04.588
My parents.

37:04.590 --> 37:05.855
My parents?

37:05.857 --> 37:07.891
Aah!
[gunshot]

37:07.893 --> 37:09.593
[riley sobbing]

37:09.595 --> 37:13.530
Oh, get him off of me,
please get him off of me!

37:15.300 --> 37:16.800
Where's my dad?

37:16.802 --> 37:18.635
He's right outside.
Are you all right?

37:18.637 --> 37:19.736
Yeah, I'm ok.

37:19.738 --> 37:22.906
All right, come with me.
Come with me.

37:42.628 --> 37:45.028
I was surprised
you took that shot.

37:45.030 --> 37:47.430
Yeah, me, too.

37:47.432 --> 37:50.900
It's your first time.
You all right?

37:50.902 --> 37:54.004
Yeah. Um...

37:54.006 --> 37:57.807
Just, uh, just tired.

37:57.809 --> 37:59.843
That's how it is.

38:01.313 --> 38:02.746
Every time?

38:02.748 --> 38:05.482
Lewis, he was gonna
kill that little girl.

38:05.484 --> 38:07.350
You did what
you had to do.

38:07.352 --> 38:10.420
Yeah, I know.

38:10.422 --> 38:13.323
Tomorrow's a new day.

38:13.325 --> 38:16.726
[sighs] you are right
about that.

38:16.728 --> 38:19.562
Well, it's a good thing
you're staying.

38:19.564 --> 38:21.331
Well, you know, too.

38:21.333 --> 38:22.432
Come on, now.

38:22.434 --> 38:24.501
Sometimes the days
are just rough.

38:24.503 --> 38:26.569
That's what this job is.

38:27.839 --> 38:28.905
[riley crying]

38:28.907 --> 38:32.075
And then sometimes
you get to see that.

39:04.710 --> 39:06.676
Hey.

39:06.678 --> 39:08.678
So what do you think?

39:08.680 --> 39:10.847
Honestly, I don't know
what to do.

39:10.849 --> 39:12.882
I mean, I have to take
this research project,

39:12.884 --> 39:15.385
But I don't want
to leave the bau.

39:15.387 --> 39:17.387
I actually think
I'm a better interviewer

39:17.389 --> 39:19.089
Now that you've made me
a better profiler.

39:19.091 --> 39:21.624
Well, what if
you could do both--

39:21.626 --> 39:23.626
Coordinate a team
and consult with us?

39:23.628 --> 39:25.762
[chuckles]

39:25.764 --> 39:27.130
Uh...

39:27.132 --> 39:28.398
You--you'd do that?

39:28.400 --> 39:29.566
Of course.

39:29.568 --> 39:31.501
The director's
already approved it.

39:31.503 --> 39:34.404
Hey, I don't know what
favors you called in, but--

39:34.406 --> 39:35.872
It's not about favors.

39:35.874 --> 39:38.875
It's about everything
you've brought
to your time here.

39:38.877 --> 39:41.978
When you find good people,
you don't want to lose them.

39:44.816 --> 39:46.416
Thank you, sir.

39:52.657 --> 39:56.059
Lewis: "to remain indifferent
to the challenges we face

39:56.061 --> 39:58.061
"is indefensible.

39:58.063 --> 40:01.164
"if the goal is noble,

40:01.166 --> 40:05.068
"whether or not
it is realized
within our lifetime

40:05.070 --> 40:08.438
"is largely irrelevant.

40:08.440 --> 40:11.841
"what we must do, therefore,

40:11.843 --> 40:15.612
"is to strive
and persevere

40:15.614 --> 40:19.015
And never give up."

40:19.017 --> 40:22.085
Dalai lama the fourteenth.
