WEBVTT

00:26.394 --> 00:28.829
Star, you don't have
to do this.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.164
I must.

00:30.198 --> 00:31.799
Accept your fate, human.

00:31.832 --> 00:32.833
Never!

00:32.866 --> 00:34.102
Very well.

00:34.135 --> 00:36.504
Remember, you asked for this.

00:36.537 --> 00:39.540
Tickle war!

00:46.580 --> 00:49.617
Titan, tita... Titans, go!

00:53.187 --> 00:55.823
No, don't. Don't do it!

00:57.391 --> 00:58.759
I got to pee!

01:03.431 --> 01:04.798
Yeah, you got me.

01:07.135 --> 01:08.302
It's no use, Star.

01:08.336 --> 01:11.272
My computer parts
cannot be tickled.

01:12.606 --> 01:14.442
Oh!

01:16.610 --> 01:18.812
Belly button!

01:20.881 --> 01:23.651
And I couldn't forget you,
my little bumgorf.

01:25.619 --> 01:28.322
Man, Starfire is so upbeat!

01:28.356 --> 01:29.757
Her happiness makes me happy.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.725
-Thirteen seconds.

01:31.759 --> 01:34.462
That's the longest
you were ever in
a good mood, mama.

01:34.495 --> 01:36.497
-That was a record.

01:36.530 --> 01:37.831
I have to know, Star,

01:37.865 --> 01:39.800
where does your cheery
disposition come from?

01:40.601 --> 01:42.403
I suppose it comes
from growing up

01:42.436 --> 01:44.438
on my home planet, Tamaran.

01:44.472 --> 01:45.739
If it made you this nice,

01:45.773 --> 01:48.642
it must be the best place
in the universe.

01:50.811 --> 01:51.712
Okay, okay.

01:51.745 --> 01:54.848
Wait your turn, please.
No, no. You go next.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.885
When you gonna take us there?

01:57.918 --> 02:00.454
I am not sure
you would like it.

02:00.488 --> 02:02.456
We like you.
We'll like your planet.

02:02.490 --> 02:05.259
You may find
my Tamaranian ways strange,

02:05.293 --> 02:08.196
much like I find some
of the Earth ways strange.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.568
A poem for milady.

02:14.602 --> 02:17.338
Is that a sunrise on yon lake?

02:17.371 --> 02:20.274
Nay. 'Tis your eyes.

02:20.308 --> 02:21.775
It would mean so much to me,

02:21.809 --> 02:24.478
if I could share
this special place.

02:24.512 --> 02:26.314
Then share away.

02:26.347 --> 02:27.815
Let's go to space!

02:49.703 --> 02:52.406
It is so good to be home.

02:53.741 --> 02:57.978
Ah. I missed the crispness
of Tamaranian air.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.456
My lungs are crying!

03:08.489 --> 03:11.559
What are we breathing, Star?

03:11.592 --> 03:14.262
That is
the Tamaranian fire air.

03:14.295 --> 03:15.696
What

03:15.729 --> 03:19.467
Your planet's air
is made out of hot sauce.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.735
It ensures the weak
do not survive.

03:21.769 --> 03:23.637
You will grow accustomed
to the burning.

03:23.671 --> 03:27.741
* The pain
All I know is pain *

03:29.743 --> 03:32.713
Oh, do not die
so quickly, friends.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.282
We have just arrived!

03:34.315 --> 03:37.451
There are so many more
wonderful things to see.

03:38.886 --> 03:41.955
ROBIN: Wow!
This place is amazing.

03:41.989 --> 03:42.923
Give us the tour, Star.

03:42.956 --> 03:44.825
We want to see
all the things that made you

03:44.858 --> 03:46.794
such a sweet
little cuddle bug.

03:46.827 --> 03:50.230
As a Tamaranian princess,
this palace was my home.

03:54.702 --> 03:57.305
We often entertained kings,
queens and warlords,

03:57.338 --> 03:59.740
in an effort to keep the peace
of the galaxy.

03:59.773 --> 04:02.576
This is General Thraxis
of the Blood Dominion.

04:02.610 --> 04:03.711
We are working on

04:03.744 --> 04:06.314
a very important treaty
with him now.

04:06.347 --> 04:07.881
What up, General?

04:14.788 --> 04:17.057
What was that about?

04:17.090 --> 04:19.327
Oh, on Tamaran,
a handshake

04:19.360 --> 04:21.895
is the most violent
declaration of war.

04:21.929 --> 04:23.864
He has vowed
to wipe out my people

04:23.897 --> 04:26.767
and turn Tamaran
into intergalactic gravel.

04:26.800 --> 04:27.735
My bad.

04:27.768 --> 04:30.638
That is the all right,
but you must excuse me,

04:30.671 --> 04:32.840
I need to rally
a planetary defense.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.011
Charge!

04:43.651 --> 04:44.952
You have to shake
everyone's hand?

04:44.985 --> 04:46.754
I'm a friendly guy,
what do you want me to do?

04:51.525 --> 04:52.726
This is not
what I was expecting.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.728
I'm not sure
I like Starfire's planet.

04:54.762 --> 04:56.630
It's definitely not
as sweet as she is.

04:56.664 --> 04:58.031
True, but it's pretty cool

04:58.065 --> 05:00.033
watching those blob
guys explode.

05:00.868 --> 05:03.604
-There goes one!

05:03.637 --> 05:05.906
-Why does everything
burn on this planet?

05:05.939 --> 05:08.008
My face!

05:08.041 --> 05:08.742
This is terrible.

05:08.776 --> 05:10.578
Let's go
before things get worse.

05:10.611 --> 05:14.648
No, Raven. It means so much
to Starfire that we're here.

05:14.682 --> 05:17.084
Yo! The cries of terror
have stopped.

05:17.117 --> 05:19.687
Maybe Cyborg's
handshake war is over.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.021
Handshakes are friendly,

05:21.054 --> 05:22.756
I don't care who you are,
they are friendly.

05:22.790 --> 05:25.893
Good news!
The war has concluded

05:25.926 --> 05:29.129
and only three-quarters
of the planet were destroyed.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.464
That's great!

05:30.498 --> 05:31.765
I'm so happy
for you, Starfire.

05:31.799 --> 05:33.501
As is the custom on Tamaran,

05:33.534 --> 05:34.868
I brokered a truce

05:34.902 --> 05:36.937
by offering my hand
in marriage to the General.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.408
ROBIN: No!

05:44.144 --> 05:46.380
Why did you have
to shake his hand?

05:46.414 --> 05:48.115
Why I ask you, Cyborg, why?

05:48.148 --> 05:50.884
I can't help it.
I'm just a friendly guy.

05:50.918 --> 05:53.421
I like putting people at ease.

05:56.457 --> 05:59.159
It should have been me.

05:59.192 --> 06:02.463
I really, really hate
this planet.

06:02.496 --> 06:06.166
How can anyone
as nice and perfect as
Starfire come from here?

06:06.199 --> 06:07.835
Ew! Look.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.903
Now she has to kiss
all those mouths.

06:09.937 --> 06:12.473
And she never kissed you
on your one mouth.

06:12.506 --> 06:13.674
Bummer.

06:18.512 --> 06:20.013
We're gonna be here awhile.

06:32.460 --> 06:34.194
Was the ceremony
not beautiful?

06:34.227 --> 06:37.631
Now, please enjoy the rest
of your stay on Tamaran.

06:37.665 --> 06:39.166
-I must go.

06:39.199 --> 06:41.935
As the General's wife,
I must travel with his fleet

06:41.969 --> 06:43.671
in order
to attend to his mouths

06:43.704 --> 06:45.439
as he conquers the universe.

06:45.473 --> 06:46.674
You will never see me again.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.642
What? You can't go with him.

06:49.810 --> 06:51.779
I know our customs
seem strange,

06:51.812 --> 06:53.947
but it is important
to honor them.

06:53.981 --> 06:55.883
Goodbye forever, friends.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.485
This is not cool!

06:57.518 --> 06:59.720
If Starfire is going to be
forced to marry anyone,

06:59.753 --> 07:00.954
it's going to be me.

07:00.988 --> 07:04.057
Titans, let's annul
this marriage.

07:12.733 --> 07:13.934
Ahhh!

07:14.902 --> 07:17.771
Friends, why did you
blow up my husband?

07:17.805 --> 07:19.740
The peace treaty
is now broken.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.174
The General's army
will soon attack,

07:21.208 --> 07:22.943
and I have dishonored
my people.

07:22.976 --> 07:24.211
And you are welcome.

07:24.244 --> 07:26.880
-He was gross.
-Yeah, super gross!

07:26.914 --> 07:29.550
Now the only way to save
my planet from the invasion

07:29.583 --> 07:30.984
is in a traditional show
of bravery

07:31.018 --> 07:33.053
by fighting Gridnock,
the skull crusher.

07:33.086 --> 07:35.989
And if you don't,
this planet will be destroyed?

07:36.724 --> 07:38.091
Yes.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.960
Sounds good to me,
let's go home.

07:40.828 --> 07:42.162
TITANS: Ahhh!

07:42.195 --> 07:44.197
These are
the guardians of honor.

07:44.231 --> 07:46.667
They will escort us
to our inevitable deaths

07:46.700 --> 07:48.135
at the hands of Gridnock.

07:48.168 --> 07:49.703
Hello, guardians!

07:49.737 --> 07:52.172
Keeping those axes
sharp, I see.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.894
Is he not magnificent?

08:13.927 --> 08:15.729
Why are you
so happy about this?

08:15.763 --> 08:19.132
It is an honor to prove
one's bravery on Tamaran.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.234
So, how many people
have survived Gridnock?

08:21.268 --> 08:24.104
None. That is why
it is such an honor.

08:28.141 --> 08:29.009
None, Star?

08:29.042 --> 08:31.645
Well, he's never faced
the Teen Titans.

08:31.679 --> 08:32.980
Titans, go!

08:38.085 --> 08:40.721
Whoa. Did we just get eaten?
That was fast!

08:45.058 --> 08:46.560
Don't take this
the wrong way, Star,

08:46.594 --> 08:48.962
but we hate your planet
and everything on it!

08:48.996 --> 08:51.164
You are hurting
the feelings, Robin.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.601
It's true.
This planet is awful.

08:53.634 --> 08:56.236
We have no idea how you came
from a place like this.

08:58.806 --> 09:01.274
Yes, life can be hard
on Tamaran.

09:01.308 --> 09:03.010
But if I only saw
the negative,

09:03.043 --> 09:05.779
my skull would have
been crushed many years ago.

09:05.813 --> 09:07.080
Instead, I have learned

09:07.114 --> 09:09.617
to find the best
in any situation.

09:09.650 --> 09:12.786
In fact, that is the only way
I have been able to tolerate

09:12.820 --> 09:14.888
you all as my roommates.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.925
Oh, Star, that's beautiful.

09:17.958 --> 09:20.027
I always wondered
why you didn't hate us.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.328
Well, if we're gonna die,

09:21.361 --> 09:23.664
we might as well
be positive like Starfire.

09:23.697 --> 09:25.966
We're in an alien
rock monster's belly,

09:25.999 --> 09:28.335
what's not to love?

09:32.139 --> 09:34.274
Look, is that
a half

09:40.781 --> 09:42.015
Not a hot dog,

09:42.049 --> 09:44.985
but I've never tasted
anything like it before!

09:46.386 --> 09:50.924
Hmm. It's so nice and warm
in here like a free sauna.

09:50.958 --> 09:53.961
Gettin' a good sweat on.
Detoxin'.

09:53.994 --> 09:56.196
-Oh!

09:59.733 --> 10:01.234
If Star survived so long

10:01.268 --> 10:03.103
because of her
positive attitude,

10:03.136 --> 10:05.405
then we have
to think like her.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.240
You know what that means.

10:07.274 --> 10:08.308
Titans!

10:08.341 --> 10:10.010
Tickle War!

10:15.883 --> 10:17.951
Belly button!

10:32.900 --> 10:34.968
We defeated the Gridnock!

10:35.002 --> 10:37.437
-Yeah, kid.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.006
We couldn't have done it

10:39.039 --> 10:40.741
without seeing things
the Tamaranian way, Star.

10:40.774 --> 10:43.977
Now do you understand
why I love this planet so?

10:44.011 --> 10:45.713
I think we do, Star.

10:45.746 --> 10:49.049
Then, perhaps you will let me
show you more of Tamaran.

10:49.082 --> 10:50.751
-Let's get out of here.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.252
Worst place ever!

10:52.285 --> 10:53.220
Blah!
