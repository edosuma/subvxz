-Yes I do.
-Why?

Kira, did you transfer to this
school to annoy me everyday?

04:43.784 --> 04:46.203
-Is that your job in life?
-I don't know, maybe it is.

04:46.203 --> 04:47.746
Oh, maybe it is? Huh.

04:47.746 --> 04:49.748

do anything. Oh, come on Lucy.

she's here.

What? You drank Gerry's milk?

10:19.660 --> 10:23.457
Why'd you do that?
That's why Gerry's milk
has Gerry's milk on it.

[muffled] The soccer game
originally scheduled
for tomorrow,

11:17.676 --> 11:22.098
has been cancelled.

11:22.098 --> 11:24.518
...Over!

11:24.518 --> 11:26.603
And you've been
listening to the Gator...

11:26.603 --> 11:28.522
And Trudy, in the morning.

11:28.522 --> 11:32.150
[applause from phone]

11:32.150 --> 11:35.195
-And we're clear.
-[laughing]

11:35.195 --> 11:37.989
Ohhhhh. Okay, that was great.

11:37.989 --> 11:40.659
It's like a little concert
for them in the morning,
they must love it.

11:40.659 --> 11:42.743
Oh yeah, of course they do.
So, same time tomorrow?

11:42.743 --> 11:46.623
-You got it, girlfriend.
-Don't talk to me until then.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.958
No, really.

11:51.127 --> 11:54.548
All right, today we are going to
start working on an assignment.

11:54.548 --> 11:56.550
Can you tell us what
the assignment is, sir?

11:56.550 --> 11:58.843
Kira! I...

11:58.843 --> 12:01.012
Yes Kira, I will tell you
what the assignment is.

12:01.012 --> 12:03.764
You're going to write a
story about your mother.

12:03.764 --> 12:06.142
Since Mother's Day
is coming up.

12:06.142 --> 12:07.894
Sir, mother's day is in May.

12:07.894 --> 12:11.231
Okay, and May is only a few
months away Stephan, all right?

12:11.231 --> 12:14.817
So, you'll write a story about
your mother and her likes.

12:14.817 --> 12:18.446
Hobbies, places she likes to go,
things she likes to do.

12:18.446 --> 12:21.115
Also I'd like to know if there's
any other adults in the house.

12:21.115 --> 12:23.243
But not brothers and sisters,
just different adults.

12:23.243 --> 12:26.287
I'd like to know that, okay?
Yes, Lucy?

12:26.287 --> 12:28.081
Sir, what about grandparents?

12:28.081 --> 12:31.792
I don't need to know if
grandparents are in the house.
Okay?

12:31.792 --> 12:33.712
What is it out of and
when is it due?

12:33.712 --> 12:36.381
Great questions, it is out of
20 and it is due next class.

12:36.381 --> 12:39.926
But here's the catch.
The best assignment,

12:39.926 --> 12:42.470
the highest mark on this story

12:42.470 --> 12:44.847
is going to win Xavier's
new award for

12:44.847 --> 12:47.183
Best Mother/Daughter in...

12:47.183 --> 12:50.687
Best Mother/Child in the school.

12:50.687 --> 12:54.899
And I will present it to you
and your mother, after school.

12:54.899 --> 12:56.317
Sir, what if our mother
has to work?

12:56.317 --> 12:58.278
Stephan. [sighs]

12:58.278 --> 13:01.030
Have you ever had the highest
mark in anything in this class?

13:01.030 --> 13:04.409
-No, sir.
-No, so you're point is moot.

13:06.369 --> 13:09.289
Can someone please tell Stephan
what the word moot means?

13:09.289 --> 13:13.960
-It means you can't talk.
-No, okay, that's mute.

13:13.960 --> 13:17.422
-But that works too. Mute.
-Sorry Stephan, I was mixing up.

13:17.422 --> 13:19.507
Lucy, it's fine.

13:19.507 --> 13:21.468
Sorry, sir, I was
just explaining.

13:21.468 --> 13:24.845
-Yup, mute, mute.
-Okay?

13:26.431 --> 13:29.350
Let's get started. Kira,
collect last night's homework.

13:29.350 --> 13:32.228
I'd also like Kira to take
the attendance to the office.

13:32.228 --> 13:34.855
How about a hand for Kira,
she's doing a lot today.
-Thank you, thank you.

13:34.855 --> 13:37.984
All this help and good
questions. She's doing
a really good job. All right.

13:37.984 --> 13:42.821
Kira, Kira, bobira, banana
fanna, bofira, Kira bobira.

13:44.282 --> 13:46.242
Ten and two.

13:46.242 --> 13:48.869
What happens if one
slips to nine or three?

13:48.869 --> 13:51.331
Then you crash,
and then you die.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.040
Okay, got it.

13:53.040 --> 13:55.794
[car horn sounds]

13:55.794 --> 13:58.630
-See, when people honk,
that scares me.
-[car horn sounds]

13:58.630 --> 14:01.299
-I can smell your fear.
-How do you stay so calm?

14:01.299 --> 14:04.177
It's just mind over matter.

14:04.177 --> 14:07.180
-[car horn sounds]
-[woman] Come on, come on.

14:07.180 --> 14:10.891
-Okay.
-[car horn blaring]

14:10.891 --> 14:14.145
-Excuse me.
-Where are you going?

14:14.145 --> 14:16.773
-[car horn sounds]
-What are you doing
with the bat?

14:22.069 --> 14:24.698
Honk again, honk one more time.

14:27.408 --> 14:29.410
Yeah.

14:36.584 --> 14:39.170
-Thank you.
-Ten and two.

14:39.170 --> 14:42.048
-Yeah.
-Old people.

14:45.760 --> 14:48.722
And, there you are.

14:48.722 --> 14:52.726
Okay! One left.
Kira, stand up please.

14:52.726 --> 14:54.853
Face your classmates.

14:54.853 --> 15:01.025
Because Kira McGrory got
21 out of 20, bonus mark
for this assignment.

15:01.025 --> 15:06.280
Which means, Kira and her mother
are this year's Xavier award,
parent/child winners.

15:06.280 --> 15:09.033
-Thank you Mr. D!
-You are welcome.

15:09.033 --> 15:12.620
How about a hand for Kira!
Okay, all right, that's good.

15:12.620 --> 15:15.039
Yeah, too much.
Go have a seat.

15:15.039 --> 15:17.166
So I'm going to need you
to call your mother today.

15:17.166 --> 15:18.959
See if she can come in
after school

15:18.959 --> 15:20.795
and I will give you the
award in front of her.

15:20.795 --> 15:24.883
-[whispers] I will, sir.
-All right. Another hand
for Kira!

15:24.883 --> 15:28.010
[Gerry clapping]

15:28.969 --> 15:31.222
Jealousy.

15:33.266 --> 15:36.352
-Check your mirrors.
-Check.

15:36.352 --> 15:38.772
-Foot on the brake.
-Foot is on the brake.

15:38.772 --> 15:43.276
-Turn on the ignition.
-Ignition, started.

15:43.276 --> 15:46.905
Do you know what I smell Simon?

15:47.988 --> 15:52.118
No fear.
Put the car in drive.

15:52.118 --> 15:55.079
-Car is in drive.
-Now, just a little gas.

15:55.079 --> 15:57.874
Okay.

15:57.874 --> 15:59.959
-[Thump]
-[dog whimpering]

15:59.959 --> 16:01.502
-Did I hit a dog?
-Yes, you did.

16:01.502 --> 16:02.754
-Oh!
-[dog barking]

16:02.754 --> 16:04.505
Oh, thank god, he's not dead.

16:04.505 --> 16:08.802
-I will take care of it.
-No! No, Wayne. No.

16:10.094 --> 16:12.012
Fine.

16:14.766 --> 16:16.559
-Hi, Mr. D!
-Hi, Kira.

16:16.559 --> 16:18.185
I made something
in art for you.

16:18.185 --> 16:22.732
Nice, thank you very much.
D, with a heart, for me.

16:22.732 --> 16:25.944
-What am I supposed
to do with this?
-Keep it. Forever.

16:25.944 --> 16:28.195
And if I smoke, it's an ashtray.

16:28.195 --> 16:30.740
-I don't smoke.
Did you call your mom?
-Yup!

16:30.740 --> 16:32.450
-When is she coming in?
-She's not, has to work.

16:32.450 --> 16:35.662
-Ohh.
-I have to take
the bus home tonight.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.204
That's great, okay.

16:37.204 --> 16:40.249
-Sir, you're my new
favorite teacher.
-Oh.

16:40.249 --> 16:42.335
-Congratulations.
-Thank you. Okay.

16:42.335 --> 16:45.379
I'm going to make sure I'm in
all your classes, every year.

16:45.379 --> 16:47.006
Perfect, why wouldn't you?
Thanks Kira.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.591
-Bye, Mr. D.
-Bye Kira.

16:50.551 --> 16:52.929
[Robert] It's Trudy and the
Gator in the morning.

16:52.929 --> 16:55.014
-[rooster crows]
-It's Trudy and the Gator...

16:55.014 --> 16:56.891
-Gator in the morning.
-[lion roars]

16:56.891 --> 16:59.811
It's Trudy...
It's Trudy and Gator.

17:01.145 --> 17:02.981
Hey! Just a little heads up.

17:02.981 --> 17:05.566
Kira McGrory girl's gonna
transfer from my class
to your class.

17:05.566 --> 17:08.194
-She's got a scheduling
thing so...
-What?

17:08.194 --> 17:10.822
We teach the same grade
at the same time.

17:10.822 --> 17:12.824
How could that
be a scheduling conflict?

17:12.824 --> 17:17.203
And that means I'm going to have
32 kids in my class. No way.

17:17.203 --> 17:20.247
Well it's happening,
so I'm just preaching the news.

17:20.247 --> 17:22.000
Well, I'm gonna have
to talk to Callaghan.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.878
Okay, fine, fine. Look this
girl's driving me nuts.

17:24.878 --> 17:27.672
Okay? And I don't want
to teach her anymore.
So just take her.

17:27.672 --> 17:29.632
She's got a crush on me,
too, which makes it worse.

17:29.632 --> 17:32.802
-I had the same...
-No you didn't, don't lie
straight to my face.

17:32.802 --> 17:37.097
Bye Gerry.
Good luck with Kira.

17:37.097 --> 17:39.893
Never had a crush on you.
Pfft.

17:42.812 --> 17:46.148
Trudy, what are all these
parents doing here?

17:46.148 --> 17:47.734
You screwed up the
announcements.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.736
No one heard that the
soccer game was cancelled.

17:49.736 --> 17:52.864
Oh! Callaghan's not going
to be happy, huh?

17:52.864 --> 17:55.742
He isn't, and I explained to
him how it was all your fault.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.410
My fault? But we're a team.

17:57.410 --> 18:00.663
Trudy and the Gator
in the morning.

18:00.663 --> 18:02.707
Mr. Cheeley, in
my office please.

18:02.707 --> 18:06.210
-Do you want to see Trudy too?
-Nope, just The Gator.

18:06.210 --> 18:08.254
Someone's a fan.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.257
-You think?

18:15.970 --> 18:18.765
-Good. Let's start today...
-Wayne!

18:18.765 --> 18:21.559
I can't do this anymore.

18:21.559 --> 18:24.311
I don't want to hurt anyone
or anything.

18:24.311 --> 18:28.066
-What are you saying to me?
-I have to quit.

18:28.066 --> 18:30.651
No, you're not ready to quit.

18:30.651 --> 18:32.987
I really don't want to
do this anymore.

18:36.699 --> 18:38.952
Now you're ready to quit.

18:53.716 --> 18:55.301
Hi, again.

18:55.301 --> 18:56.636
[Scottish accent]
Hello, big man...

18:56.636 --> 19:02.141
Hello, wee man,
hello, again, wee'un.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.893
-Wee...?
-Hi, Mom.

19:03.893 --> 19:05.770
-Hi. Yeah, you can go ahead
and drop the Scottish thing.

19:05.770 --> 19:10.108
[Scottish accent] All right.
No more. There she is.

19:10.108 --> 19:13.277
-Hey darlin'.
-You met Mr. D! He is the best.

19:13.277 --> 19:16.322
-You're Mr. D?
-Yes.

19:16.322 --> 19:19.826
We missed you at an
awards presentation yesterday.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.411
-It's called a ceremony.
-Big awards ceremony.

19:22.411 --> 19:25.164
-Yes, a really important one.
-Yes.

19:25.164 --> 19:28.126
-Shame.
-Sarcasm, I like it, haha.

19:28.126 --> 19:30.461
-[Lisa] Gerry.
-Yeah, so.

19:30.461 --> 19:32.672
-Okay.
-[Lisa] Hi Gerry.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.841
-What's for dinner?
-What do you want?

19:34.841 --> 19:37.217
-Umm, macaroni!
-Great, are you hungry?

19:37.217 --> 19:40.346
-Yup!
-So, we'll have to reschedule...

19:40.346 --> 19:42.389
We'll have to reschedule
so we can meet again.

19:42.389 --> 19:46.602
-Yeah, we will have to do that.
-Okay, and I will call
you to do that.

19:46.602 --> 19:48.228
-Great. Okay.
-Bye, Kira.

19:48.228 --> 19:50.523
-I'll see ya tomorrow!
-Yeah, I can't wait.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.525
-Later.
-Okay, you waved already.

19:52.525 --> 19:55.194
-Bye!
-All right, I get it Kira, bye.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.904
Gosh.

20:05.621 --> 20:07.414
[phone ringing]

20:07.414 --> 20:09.583
[Kira's voice on phone]
Hi, you have reached
the McGrory's.

20:09.583 --> 20:11.669
We aren't here to take
your call right now.

20:11.669 --> 20:14.463
So please leave a message
at the beep... Beeeep!

20:14.463 --> 20:17.717
-Hey it's Mr. D calling, just...
-[Kira] Just kidding!

20:17.717 --> 20:20.260
Here comes the real beep.
Beep.

20:20.260 --> 20:23.056
-Hey, McGrory...
-[Kira] Gotcha again!

20:23.056 --> 20:26.392
-Shut up, Kira.
-I promise, here it comes.

20:26.392 --> 20:31.022
-[beep]
-Hey, hey, it's Mr. D from...

20:31.022 --> 20:35.109
uh, the school calling,
yeah I think this is
going through, now.

20:35.109 --> 20:40.948
Anyway, just wanted to follow up
about getting you that award

20:40.948 --> 20:43.534
that you have both won,
congratulations again.

20:43.534 --> 20:46.370
Though I'd maybe bring it in and
maybe meet at the school.

20:46.370 --> 20:48.956
Or we could do it at like a
restaurant, in the night.

20:48.956 --> 20:52.292
Ummm, maybe when
Kira's asleep... [laughs]

20:52.292 --> 20:55.337
...with a babysitter
No, bring Kira.

20:55.337 --> 20:58.298
I was kidding,
I'd really like Kira to come.

20:58.298 --> 21:02.011
Uh, or not, I guess.
I don't know.

21:02.011 --> 21:06.557
You, it's your family, why would
I tell you in a voice message?

21:06.557 --> 21:11.062
That's um...anyway, blah, blah,
blah. Look at me, going on.

21:11.062 --> 21:14.107
I just really want to make
sure that I get... it's clear...

21:14.107 --> 21:16.192
-...that I'm...
-[beep]

21:16.192 --> 21:20.238
Hmmm, never let's you go long.
