find a way to fix it.

00:59.091 --> 01:01.828
There's no fixing it,
maybe I should just quit.

No, you can't quit.

02:45.330 --> 02:47.233
Miss Martian was needed
at the meta-human youth center.

02:47.233 --> 02:49.867
So she assigned me
to lead Gamma Squad.

02:49.901 --> 02:52.905
This will be a covert mission.
Recon only.

02:52.937 --> 02:55.806

recon only.

02:55.842 --> 02:58.343
-It never turns out that way.
-(CLICKING)

02:58.377 --> 03:01.212
The mission had better
turn out that way,

03:01.247 --> 03:04.116
since the League is not
allowed in Russia without
prior consent.

03:04.150 --> 03:06.085
Russia?

03:06.117 --> 03:08.388
We're being sent
to investigate Russia's
Ploshed 52 base.

03:08.419 --> 03:12.192
We have intel of
a possible government
sponsored meta-program there.

03:12.223 --> 03:15.161
No doubt the Russian
equivalent of Bedlam.

03:15.193 --> 03:19.132
I understand Markovia
suffered under
the former Soviet Union,

03:19.163 --> 03:20.866
but do not pre-judge.

03:20.900 --> 03:24.204
Yes, this may be
Russia's equivalent
to Bedlam,

03:24.235 --> 03:26.872
or it may be
their equivalent to Taos.

Hello and welcome
to the S.T.A.R. Labs
Taos meta-human youth center.

04:05.943 --> 04:10.116
I am Director of Facility
Dr. Eduardo Dorado, Sr.

04:10.150 --> 04:12.085
And I'm just Ed.
Peer Counselor.

04:12.116 --> 04:14.218
EDUARDO SR.: I'm sure
you all have questions.

04:14.252 --> 04:16.221
I'm here to give
you answers.

04:16.254 --> 04:19.057
And I'm here to translate
from adult speak.

04:19.091 --> 04:21.394
You have been through
registration,

04:21.427 --> 04:23.562
it is time for orientation.

04:23.596 --> 04:25.298
Let's face it,
you've been through hell,

04:25.331 --> 04:27.266
so this won't be
quite as painful.

04:27.300 --> 04:29.067
First things first.

04:29.100 --> 04:31.170
You are not prisoners here.

04:31.204 --> 04:35.540
You can leave anytime
you want, you can stay
as long as you need.

04:35.574 --> 04:37.475
You set the pace.

04:37.511 --> 04:40.346
You'll all receive
counseling from Dinah Lance

04:40.379 --> 04:41.879
or Megan Morse,

04:41.913 --> 04:44.016
who are experts
in meta-teen issues.

04:44.050 --> 04:47.319
They're crash... Great,
you can really talk to them.

04:47.353 --> 04:50.389
Or to your Peer Counselors,
me and Luth back there.

04:50.423 --> 04:52.225
We've been through this
and want to help.

04:52.257 --> 04:54.394
You will also
receive training

04:54.427 --> 04:57.531
on how to deal with
your new meta-abilities.

04:57.564 --> 05:00.466
You all feel like freaks.
Believe me, I know.

05:00.500 --> 05:03.168
But that feeling doesn't
have to last forever.

05:03.201 --> 05:06.038
EDUARDO SR.: Control
is the goal here at Taos.

05:06.072 --> 05:10.242
Which is why you'll have
the option of wearing
an inhibitor collar.

05:10.276 --> 05:14.079
This can turn off your powers
completely if you like.

05:14.112 --> 05:17.083
Full disclosure, these collars
were originally developed

05:17.115 --> 05:19.218
for meta-criminals
Belle Reve Penitentiary.

05:19.252 --> 05:21.887
The difference here is,
you're in control.

05:21.920 --> 05:24.490
You decide when to
put the collar on,
when to take it off

05:24.524 --> 05:27.060
or whether
you want one at all.

05:27.093 --> 05:31.531
Either way, the ultimate goal
is to safely reintegrate each
and every one of you

05:31.564 --> 05:33.064
back into society.

05:33.098 --> 05:36.548

07:15.600 --> 07:17.536
Because it's not our business.

07:17.571 --> 07:20.439
If volunteers wanna be heroes,
who are we to say no?

07:20.473 --> 07:23.410

them as super soldiers

07:23.442 --> 07:25.711
