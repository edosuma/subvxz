00:08.205 --> 00:10.200
Previously on Get Shorty...

00:10.205 --> 00:11.201
Fucking Christ.

00:11.206 --> 00:13.200
What? He was talkin' shit!

00:13.205 --> 00:14.201
My wife's boyfriend!

00:14.206 --> 00:16.200
That's your wife's boyfriend?

00:16.204 --> 00:17.605
Get in your car. I'll move him out.

00:18.206 --> 00:20.200
I think its best you don't
tell anyone about this.

00:20.205 --> 00:21.205
Not even Katie.

00:23.205 --> 00:25.200
This is a beautiful story.

00:25.205 --> 00:28.200
It's honest and it's real and
I promise when you read it,

00:28.205 --> 00:31.200
you'll realize you would've
wanted to make this movie anyway.

00:31.205 --> 00:35.200
If you don't, I'll ruin you.
I'll ruin your fuckin' life.

00:35.205 --> 00:39.200
You think you walk over
me because I am a woman?

00:39.205 --> 00:41.200
You little dick maricon.

00:41.205 --> 00:42.201
Go back up north

00:42.206 --> 00:46.205
or I cut your fucking legs off.

01:08.410 --> 01:10.405
Still alive?

01:10.410 --> 01:12.405
I thought you wanted to speak to him.

01:13.411 --> 01:16.047
If you don't, I'll, I'll finish up.

01:17.410 --> 01:19.405
I come in.

01:26.410 --> 01:28.410
Someone's here to see you.

02:22.410 --> 02:23.406
Shit.

02:23.411 --> 02:25.405
Amara. Hi.

02:25.410 --> 02:26.405
I love.

02:26.410 --> 02:27.406
What's that?

02:27.411 --> 02:29.405
Script for my movie.

02:31.410 --> 02:33.405
You read the script.

02:33.410 --> 02:36.405
That's great. Isn't it,
it's, it's terrific, isn't it?

02:36.410 --> 02:37.406
I mean, I mean, I, I really think...

02:37.411 --> 02:39.405
How is John Stamos?

02:39.410 --> 02:42.405
We haven't started casting,

02:42.410 --> 02:45.410
so I haven't had the chance
to meet Mr. Stamos just yet.

02:47.410 --> 02:48.410
I want a photo.

02:49.410 --> 02:51.405
Okay...

02:51.410 --> 02:53.405
Stamos. Autografo. Should say,

02:53.410 --> 02:58.410
"Amara, Que Bella.
With love, John Stamos."

02:59.410 --> 03:01.405
"With love." No problemo.

03:01.410 --> 03:05.597
Um, soon as I meet Mr. Stamos,
I'll have him do that for you.

03:05.787 --> 03:07.510
- Stay in touch.
- Absolutely, we will.

03:07.557 --> 03:10.621
And let us know the
moment that... Hello?

03:11.410 --> 03:12.406
Every fucking time.

03:12.411 --> 03:14.405
- What'd she want?
- Man. She's happy.

03:14.410 --> 03:16.405
- Yeah?
- Very happy investor, man.

03:16.410 --> 03:17.406
She read the script, she loves it.

03:17.411 --> 03:19.405
She says it's "muy romantico."

03:20.165 --> 03:22.405
And that's the beauty
of a story like this.

03:22.410 --> 03:25.405
You know, even if you're a
psychopath, it touches your heart.

03:25.410 --> 03:27.405
I mean, sh... She read it?

03:27.410 --> 03:31.410
I haven't even read it. And I wrote it.

03:49.219 --> 03:50.215
What's up, bro?

03:50.236 --> 03:53.129
What's up? Not him.

03:53.219 --> 03:54.629
No, he, he's cool.

03:54.687 --> 03:56.686
Ain't about being cool, bro.

03:58.410 --> 04:00.405
Okay.

04:04.410 --> 04:08.405
Yo. Everyone so on edge, dog.
It's like freakin' me out.

04:08.410 --> 04:10.405
That's how it's gotta be.

04:10.410 --> 04:11.406
Yeah, for how long?

04:11.411 --> 04:14.405
If you heard what Amara told Josias?

04:14.410 --> 04:16.404
She was like, "This shit is war."

04:17.411 --> 04:20.404
If anyone should be on
the lookout, it's me.

04:20.410 --> 04:21.406
Why?

04:21.411 --> 04:23.405
I'm a lieutenant.

04:23.410 --> 04:27.405
If they cap you, no offense,
but that's not headline news.

04:27.410 --> 04:31.410
They cap me? That's some serious shit.

04:33.410 --> 04:34.410
Yeah.

04:44.410 --> 04:46.405
The sign looks good.

04:46.410 --> 04:47.410
And professional, yeah.

04:54.410 --> 04:56.405
Put the plant
over by the window,

04:56.410 --> 04:58.405
- it'll die slower.
- Yes, ma'am.

04:58.410 --> 05:00.405
Heyhey. Pretty cool?

05:00.410 --> 05:02.405
- This is all us?
- All us.

05:02.410 --> 05:03.406
I can't find the coffee machine though?

05:03.411 --> 05:06.405
Please, if somebody
finds it, let me know.

05:06.410 --> 05:08.405
You and Rick have a
2:00 p.m. with April.

05:08.410 --> 05:10.405
Is it just them, or should I...

05:10.410 --> 05:12.405
Far as I know, it's just producers.

05:12.410 --> 05:15.405
And we need your headshot for
the announcement in the trades.

05:15.410 --> 05:17.405
The trades, right.

05:17.410 --> 05:18.406
Trade what?

05:18.411 --> 05:20.405
Industry magazines, websites.

05:20.410 --> 05:23.405
Wait. His picture's going in a magazine?

05:23.410 --> 05:24.406
Yeah, this is what they always do

05:24.411 --> 05:26.405
when you have a "Go" picture.

05:26.410 --> 05:27.406
I don't have a headshot, though.

05:27.411 --> 05:31.405
Not one that's, um, that's appropriate.

05:31.410 --> 05:33.405
That's fine. The studio
will set up a photo shoot.

05:35.410 --> 05:37.405
Gladys, what the hell is this?

05:37.410 --> 05:40.405
What, I leave here for one
minute and this fucking thing?

05:40.410 --> 05:41.406
What movie is that?

05:41.411 --> 05:44.405
The biggest disaster of my
career. Like I want it on the wall.

05:44.410 --> 05:45.405
Well, must have
been in your old closet.

05:45.410 --> 05:46.406
Okay. Get it off.

05:46.411 --> 05:48.405
The guy left.

05:48.410 --> 05:49.405
What guy?

05:49.410 --> 05:50.406
- Facilities.
- Well, well...

05:50.411 --> 05:53.405
Fuck. Come on.

05:53.410 --> 05:55.405
God damn it.

05:55.410 --> 05:58.405
They must've screwed
it in when they did.

05:58.410 --> 05:59.406
Except, I don't see any screws.

05:59.411 --> 06:01.405
- How did they do it?
- I'll have them come back.

06:01.410 --> 06:03.405
Please.

06:03.410 --> 06:04.405
We interrupting?

06:04.410 --> 06:05.406
No. What's up, guys?

06:05.411 --> 06:09.405
Amara was hoping to get a
signed photo of John Stamos.

06:09.410 --> 06:11.405
It's a souvenir for the investor.

06:11.410 --> 06:12.406
You think that can be arranged?

06:12.411 --> 06:15.405
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
Probably get one on Ebay.

06:15.410 --> 06:16.410
Did you see your office?

06:17.410 --> 06:18.405
I have an office?

06:18.410 --> 06:19.406
Next one over.

06:19.411 --> 06:21.405
I'll be in my office.

06:21.410 --> 06:24.410
- Coffee.
- Yeah, get the guy.

06:26.410 --> 06:28.410
So, so my office is, is...

06:29.410 --> 06:30.406
What, you need one?

06:30.411 --> 06:32.410
You already wrote the script.

06:35.410 --> 06:37.410
Can I, use your bathroom?

07:00.410 --> 07:04.405
So you must be
psyched. Owen sold his script.

07:04.410 --> 07:05.406
What?

07:05.411 --> 07:07.405
Wasn't he working on a script
called The Admiral's Mistress?

07:07.410 --> 07:10.410
A project with that title
got set up at Gravity.

07:13.410 --> 07:14.405
Cute!

07:14.410 --> 07:15.406
That's so cute.

07:15.411 --> 07:17.405
I'm actually not in touch with Owen.

07:17.410 --> 07:20.405
He basically ghosted me.

07:20.410 --> 07:21.406
I'm sorry.

07:21.411 --> 07:23.405
Yeah, no, it's fine.

07:23.410 --> 07:26.405
I mean, it's fucked, but
whatever. He sold his script.

07:26.410 --> 07:30.405
Maybe not. Maybe it just
has the same title...

07:30.410 --> 07:33.405
Can you get me a copy of
it? I can see if it's his.

07:33.410 --> 07:34.410
Totally.

07:42.410 --> 07:43.406
We're here!

07:43.411 --> 07:46.405
You can imagine how I've
been looking forward to this.

07:46.410 --> 07:48.405
Anyone like water or coffee?

07:48.410 --> 07:52.405
Um, that'd be... Can I get both?

07:52.410 --> 07:53.406
Coming right up.

07:53.411 --> 07:55.405
I'm, I'm fine. Thanks.

07:55.410 --> 07:57.405
These are the invites to
Brandon's charity gala tomorrow.

07:57.410 --> 07:59.405
Parking passes inside.

07:59.410 --> 08:02.405
You might want to check with me
before you go around handing those out.

08:02.410 --> 08:04.410
- Brandon said...
- Thanks, Marcia.

08:06.410 --> 08:08.405
What's "Cocktail attire"?

08:08.410 --> 08:10.410
Means free valet and open bar.

08:11.410 --> 08:14.405
A suit. Just wear a suit.

08:14.410 --> 08:15.405
Come on.

08:15.410 --> 08:16.406
Ms. Quinn, can I say how excited I am...

08:16.411 --> 08:18.405
No, you can't.

08:18.410 --> 08:20.405
All right. Okay.
Look, I just wanted to say,

08:20.410 --> 08:23.405
off the record, I don't care
what went on between you two.

08:23.410 --> 08:25.405
Sooner we get through this,
the sooner you can leave.

08:25.410 --> 08:27.405
I'm prepping Lethal Limit Four,

08:27.410 --> 08:29.405
a project that actually matters.

08:29.410 --> 08:31.405
So, Gravity Pictures is on board.

08:31.410 --> 08:33.405
Only Brandon won't greenlight
this unless he thinks

08:33.409 --> 08:35.405
there's an audience for it.

08:35.409 --> 08:37.191
More people than would attend, say, a

08:37.197 --> 08:39.405
high school production of The Crucible.

08:39.409 --> 08:41.405
The script needs work, obviously.

08:41.409 --> 08:42.405
Does it?

08:42.410 --> 08:44.405
I'll set up a meeting with this writer,

08:44.410 --> 08:47.405
"Louis Darnell," whoever that is.

08:47.410 --> 08:50.305
You want Louis to rewrite the script?

08:51.410 --> 08:54.405
I'm putting together a list
of prestigious directors

08:54.410 --> 08:55.406
who will want nothing to do with us.

08:55.411 --> 08:57.405
But call them and beg,

08:57.410 --> 08:59.405
or this won't get off the ground.

08:59.410 --> 09:00.406
Finally, there's cast.

09:00.411 --> 09:02.405
We have some ideas.

09:02.410 --> 09:03.406
Do you?

09:03.411 --> 09:06.405
Well, the investor weighed in.

09:06.410 --> 09:07.406
Well, since we're
buying out your investor

09:07.411 --> 09:09.410
that shouldn't be an issue. Right?

09:10.410 --> 09:11.406
What's this?

09:11.411 --> 09:13.405
It's the first I've heard of it.

09:13.410 --> 09:15.405
Lawyer stuff, I'm not
really up on details.

09:15.410 --> 09:18.405
But I do know Brandon is not
interested in a coproduction.

09:18.410 --> 09:20.405
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

09:20.410 --> 09:22.405
They're gonna buy out Amara's
distribution rights at a profit?

09:22.410 --> 09:23.406
- Correct.
- Healthy profit?

09:23.411 --> 09:25.405
Lawyer stuff, blahblah.

09:25.410 --> 09:28.405
I just know your investor's
no longer an issue.

09:28.410 --> 09:31.405
No, it's good news.

09:31.410 --> 09:32.406
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

09:32.411 --> 09:34.405
So we're still making
the film, but Amara...

09:34.410 --> 09:36.405
She's, she's made profit already, yeah.

09:36.410 --> 09:38.405
So now she's out. It's good.

09:38.410 --> 09:40.405
Amara's out.

09:40.410 --> 09:42.405
Coffee and water, there ya go!

09:42.410 --> 09:43.410
Thank you.

09:45.410 --> 09:47.570
Now that you have your
beverages, should we keep going?

09:51.410 --> 09:53.405
This was always the plan,

09:53.410 --> 09:56.405
it's just happening
way sooner than I hoped.

09:56.410 --> 09:58.405
I mean, we can move
forward with the movie

09:58.410 --> 09:59.406
and Amara's not involved.

09:59.411 --> 10:01.405
She doesn't know she's not involved.

10:01.410 --> 10:03.405
Right.

10:03.410 --> 10:06.405
When she finds out, she's gonna
want us back in Pahrump. Right?

10:06.410 --> 10:08.405
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:08.410 --> 10:11.405
No. We told her that we were gonna
make her a profit on her investment.

10:11.410 --> 10:13.405
Apart from that, we can,
you know, do our own thing.

10:13.410 --> 10:15.405
Okay. Okay. That part?

10:15.410 --> 10:17.405
The, "We can do our own thing" part?

10:17.410 --> 10:20.405
I don't remember you
running that by Amara.

10:20.410 --> 10:21.406
I'll talk to Amara.

10:21.411 --> 10:23.405
- Okay. And I'll say...
- What'll you say?

10:23.410 --> 10:25.405
I'll say, um...

10:25.410 --> 10:26.406
Well, I don't know what I'll say.

10:26.411 --> 10:28.405
But she's not expecting to get paid

10:28.410 --> 10:31.405
until the movie's in the
theaters, which is, what,

10:31.410 --> 10:33.405
like, a year from now.

10:33.410 --> 10:35.410
So maybe, in the meantime, we...

10:36.410 --> 10:37.406
We just don't mention it.

10:37.411 --> 10:39.405
No. You want to hide it from her?

10:39.410 --> 10:40.406
She's gonna get paid, Lou...

10:40.411 --> 10:42.405
She's gonna get paid. In full.

10:42.410 --> 10:46.410
Every penny. Just, you know, eventually.

10:50.410 --> 10:53.405
Can you just be fucking happy for me?

10:53.410 --> 10:54.406
- What?
- I'm doing it.

10:54.411 --> 10:58.405
Man, I'm doing it. Maybe
I feel like I belong here.

10:58.410 --> 11:00.405
You know, I'm obviously doing
something right, aren't I?

11:00.410 --> 11:02.410
People are taking notice.

11:03.410 --> 11:06.405
This was supposed to be lowprofile.

11:06.410 --> 11:09.405
Now you're getting your
picture in a magazine.

11:09.410 --> 11:11.405
I mean, that could bite you in the ass.

11:11.410 --> 11:13.455
You coming in? I need
to get some cocktail

11:13.461 --> 11:15.405
attire for Brandon's little shindig.

11:15.410 --> 11:16.405
Right.

11:16.410 --> 11:17.406
What?

11:17.411 --> 11:19.491
What, now, you have a problem
with me buying clothes?

11:20.410 --> 11:22.410
I'm gonna wait outside.

11:23.410 --> 11:25.405
Look, I know why you're pissed off,

11:25.410 --> 11:29.405
and if it were up to me, trust me,
you'd be coming to the dinner too.

11:29.410 --> 11:31.405
That's why you think I'm pissed off?

11:31.410 --> 11:32.406
Well?

11:32.411 --> 11:34.405
Well... Why don't you
go buy your $1,000 suit,

11:34.410 --> 11:38.405
and then you can, roll up to your
big fancy party in that busted rig.

11:38.410 --> 11:39.406
That'll make an impression.

11:39.411 --> 11:42.405
Aw, shit.

11:42.410 --> 11:44.405
No. No, I'm just messing with you.

11:44.410 --> 11:45.406
- No, you're right.
- No, I'm messing with you.

11:45.411 --> 11:48.405
That car, that's, that's
a classic. It's a classic.

11:48.410 --> 11:51.410
- Maybe I can lease one.
- Will you stop?

12:54.410 --> 12:56.410
What up? What do you mean?

12:57.410 --> 12:59.405
So what?

12:59.410 --> 13:01.410
Yeah, bro. I gotta go. Right. See you.

13:20.410 --> 13:23.405
Yeah.

13:23.410 --> 13:25.405
You know, it occurs to me.

13:25.410 --> 13:27.405
Emma's gonna need to do
an accent for this role.

13:27.410 --> 13:31.405
She's got natural talent but there's
a technique to that sort of thing.

13:31.410 --> 13:33.405
Just have her use yours.

13:33.410 --> 13:35.405
Yeah. No, I would.

13:35.410 --> 13:36.406
Only I'm Irish and the
character's British,

13:36.411 --> 13:38.405
which is a completely
different fuckin' thing.

13:38.410 --> 13:41.410
- Is it?
- Black or Burgundy?

13:42.410 --> 13:44.405
Burgundy.

13:44.410 --> 13:47.405
I actually picked up
a flyer in the lobby.

13:47.410 --> 13:50.405
A guy who, does acting lessons.

13:50.410 --> 13:54.405
"A safe place for kids to
connect with their inner artist.

13:54.410 --> 13:56.191
"Study character development and work

13:56.197 --> 13:58.405
with an experienced dialect coach."

13:58.410 --> 14:01.405
Yeah. Well, I mean, if you think
she needs that kind of thing.

14:01.410 --> 14:02.781
If Katie agrees, I suppose she'll have

14:02.787 --> 14:04.405
to drive Emma up here for a few days.

14:04.410 --> 14:06.405
I see what you're doing.

14:06.410 --> 14:08.410
Now I know what this is about.

14:09.410 --> 14:11.405
"Acting lessons." Right?

14:11.410 --> 14:12.406
Fuck. I nearly forgot.

14:12.411 --> 14:15.405
You have a meeting
tomorrow with April Quinn.

14:15.410 --> 14:17.405
Of what?

14:17.410 --> 14:18.406
She wants to have a little
chat about the script.

14:18.411 --> 14:20.405
It's not a big deal.

14:20.410 --> 14:22.405
"It's not a big deal?" What's
does, what does that mean?

14:22.410 --> 14:24.405
The script's already good, right?

14:24.410 --> 14:25.601
So, if she wants you to make some

14:25.607 --> 14:27.405
changes, I'm sure she'll tell you what.

14:27.410 --> 14:29.410
I haven't read the thing!

14:33.410 --> 14:34.410
Here you go.

14:39.410 --> 14:41.405
This is like a 100 pages.

14:41.410 --> 14:43.410
It's doublespaced.

14:44.410 --> 14:47.410
I have to read this
whole thing? Fuck me.

14:54.410 --> 14:56.410
Yo. You talk to her?

14:58.410 --> 15:00.405
And?

15:00.410 --> 15:02.405
She said she can't do anything.

15:02.410 --> 15:03.406
What do you mean?

15:03.411 --> 15:05.405
She said the kid didn't work for her.

15:05.410 --> 15:08.410
Yeah, but he worked for
me, and I work for her.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.405
So that's it?

15:12.410 --> 15:13.410
We just let it go?

15:15.410 --> 15:18.405
Bro, that is fucked up.

15:18.410 --> 15:20.405
We don't even know if Josias did it.

15:20.410 --> 15:23.405
Who else? Man, they
put a hole in his chest!

15:23.410 --> 15:27.405
Man, Amara needs to look
after her people, bro!

15:27.410 --> 15:30.410
I bet Josias looked after his
crew better than this shit.

15:31.410 --> 15:32.410
What did you say?

15:38.410 --> 15:39.406
What the fuck did you say?

15:39.411 --> 15:41.410
Listen. Just chill out, all right?

15:42.410 --> 15:44.410
Don't fucking talk like that.

15:52.410 --> 15:55.410
Yo, bro, I'm with you all the way.

15:56.410 --> 15:59.410
Amara, too. You know that.

16:06.410 --> 16:10.410
Glasses Kid, he was my boy, that's all.

16:26.410 --> 16:28.405
What are you doing?

16:28.410 --> 16:30.405
Hey, I'm just...

16:30.410 --> 16:33.405
I'm just washing the roasting pan.

16:33.410 --> 16:35.405
I feel like it's soaked long enough.

16:35.410 --> 16:36.410
At 4:00 a.m.?

16:38.410 --> 16:40.405
I couldn't sleep.

16:40.410 --> 16:42.405
So I thought, I'd make myself useful.

16:42.410 --> 16:44.405
I didn't, I didn't wake you up, did I?

16:44.410 --> 16:48.410
No, I just... The Xanax isn't helping?

16:49.410 --> 16:51.410
I feel more calm,

16:52.410 --> 16:56.052
but I can't sleep. I think that's
what's killing my golf game.

16:56.410 --> 16:57.410
Mom?

16:58.410 --> 17:00.405
Emma, go to sleep.

17:00.410 --> 17:01.405
What, what's happening?

17:01.410 --> 17:02.406
Nothing, Jeffery's just...

17:02.411 --> 17:04.410
I'm just cleaning up,
sweetheart. That's all.

17:05.410 --> 17:06.410
Now?

17:08.410 --> 17:10.410
Yeah, we'll both go to bed.

17:13.410 --> 17:15.405
Are you sure there isn't anything I...

17:15.410 --> 17:17.410
No. You go. I'm good. Really.

17:18.410 --> 17:19.410
Okay.

17:27.410 --> 17:29.405
Hey. Nice view?

17:29.410 --> 17:31.405
The actor from AntMan
just went into that portapotty.

17:31.410 --> 17:33.405
Took a picture for my daughter.

17:33.410 --> 17:36.405
The glamour of Hollywood, right?

17:36.410 --> 17:37.406
Listen. You got a second?

17:37.411 --> 17:40.405
- Sure.
- Yeah. Just, sit down.

17:42.410 --> 17:46.405
Look, right now, we got buzz.

17:46.410 --> 17:49.405
We're, we're in the
trades, people are talking.

17:50.411 --> 17:54.405
This is the time to
set up our next film.

17:54.410 --> 17:58.405
Yeah. So when Admiral's
Mistress comes out,

17:58.410 --> 18:02.405
you know, maybe, despite all our
best efforts, it's not so great...

18:02.410 --> 18:03.406
Why is it not so great?

18:03.411 --> 18:06.405
Or you like it but
the critics shit on it.

18:06.410 --> 18:08.405
The world moves on, you get left behind.

18:08.410 --> 18:11.405
That's a sunny prediction.

18:11.410 --> 18:14.405
What we do now is, we go now to Amara

18:14.410 --> 18:18.405
and we say, "Congratulations, you
made a profit on this last film!"

18:18.410 --> 18:20.405
"You know, 10, 20
percent, whatever it is."

18:20.410 --> 18:23.405
"Why not put some of that
money into another film?"

18:23.410 --> 18:25.405
No.

18:25.410 --> 18:28.405
You know, "Given your, your,
your passion for cinema,"

18:28.410 --> 18:30.405
etcetera, etcetera.

18:30.410 --> 18:32.405
We're not asking Amara for more money.

18:32.410 --> 18:34.410
- Why not?
- It's a bad idea.

18:35.410 --> 18:37.405
Because...

18:37.410 --> 18:38.406
Listen, you want to
set up another movie?

18:38.411 --> 18:41.405
Great, we'll find another investor.

18:41.410 --> 18:43.405
I mean, if you know people, and more...

18:43.410 --> 18:45.405
It's, it's okay for me
to bring you an investor

18:45.410 --> 18:48.405
but you don't wanna share Amara?

18:48.410 --> 18:52.102
Rick, I'm better off without Amara

18:52.410 --> 18:54.387
and so are you.

18:57.410 --> 18:59.405
Is that right?

18:59.410 --> 19:00.410
That's right.

19:02.410 --> 19:04.410
All right. Think about it.

19:07.410 --> 19:08.910
And, Rick.

19:08.958 --> 19:11.405
Let me be the one to tell her
about this business with the studio.

19:11.410 --> 19:13.405
Yeah, yeah, you handle it.

19:13.410 --> 19:16.405
All right. See you in April's office.

19:16.410 --> 19:17.410
Yeah, I'll see you there.

19:19.410 --> 19:23.405
First of all, Louis, it's
such an honor to have you here.

19:23.410 --> 19:24.998
And to realize the man behind.

19:25.004 --> 19:27.405
The Admiral's Mistress isn't British!

19:27.410 --> 19:31.405
No. No, not British.

19:31.410 --> 19:33.410
You must have done a lot of research.

19:37.410 --> 19:39.405
So, my biggest note

19:39.410 --> 19:42.405
and I do know writers hate this word.

19:42.410 --> 19:46.405
But in the second half, when
Felton becomes the Admiral...

19:46.410 --> 19:49.410
Is there a way to make that
character more sympathetic?

19:57.410 --> 20:00.405
The, character,
the Admiral character.

20:00.410 --> 20:01.490
Right, right, right. Right.

20:05.410 --> 20:06.405
So you're thinking...

20:06.410 --> 20:07.410
More sympathetic.

20:08.410 --> 20:09.410
The Admiral.

20:16.410 --> 20:19.405
Emphasize his courage, the
innocence he's retained.

20:19.410 --> 20:21.405
I know he becomes a war profiteer,

20:21.410 --> 20:24.405
but maybe he was forced into it?

20:24.410 --> 20:27.363
So, forced.

20:29.410 --> 20:30.410
No?

20:33.410 --> 20:35.405
The reason he's a puppeteer...

20:35.410 --> 20:37.405
Profiteer. He's a profiteer.

20:37.410 --> 20:39.405
I think the important thing to remember

20:39.410 --> 20:42.405
is where he's coming from, emotionally.

20:42.410 --> 20:43.406
- Right, Louis?
- Mmhmm.

20:43.411 --> 20:45.688
I mean, he's obviously
doing it for love.

20:45.775 --> 20:48.191
Yeah, no, I get that. But I'm sensing

20:48.197 --> 20:50.405
that Louis has a different take on this.

20:50.410 --> 20:52.410
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

20:54.410 --> 20:55.410
How do you see it?

20:57.410 --> 20:58.406
Um...

20:58.411 --> 21:02.405
Well, that was during the war.

21:02.410 --> 21:06.410
So, I mean, right there.

21:07.410 --> 21:10.405
I mean, the flip side of that coin...

21:10.410 --> 21:13.405
The flip side of war is peace.

21:13.410 --> 21:15.405
It's peace.

21:15.410 --> 21:20.405
Um, so, basically, when, when
you're looking at the Admiral,

21:20.410 --> 21:22.410
you, um...

21:25.410 --> 21:26.410
What was the question?

21:27.411 --> 21:29.405
Moreweather Productions.

21:29.410 --> 21:30.406
Is Owen there?

21:30.411 --> 21:33.405
- Who?
- Owen Eidler.

21:33.410 --> 21:37.405
He wrote the movie you're making.
The Admiral's Mistress.

21:37.410 --> 21:40.405
Our script was
written by Louis Darnell.

21:40.410 --> 21:42.405
No, it was not.

21:42.410 --> 21:45.405
- Who is this?
- Owen's girlfriend, Caroline.

21:45.410 --> 21:47.405
Or exgirlfriend, I'm not sure.

21:47.410 --> 21:51.405
Caroline, I'd be happy to forward
your information to our attorney.

21:51.410 --> 21:52.705
I have both copies.

21:52.761 --> 21:55.302
Owen's and the one that
says "Louis Darnell".

21:55.308 --> 21:58.405
And they're the same
script. I mean word for word.

21:58.410 --> 22:01.405
So, either Owen's using a pen name

22:01.410 --> 22:04.405
or you guys bought the script and...

22:04.410 --> 22:06.405
You know what? I don't
care what happened.

22:06.410 --> 22:08.405
I just need to find Owen.

22:08.410 --> 22:10.405
I don't know who that is.

22:10.410 --> 22:11.406
Well, somebody knows.

22:11.411 --> 22:13.405
And they better call me back like today.

22:13.410 --> 22:14.406
What was that number?

22:14.411 --> 22:16.405
It's fouronefive...

22:16.410 --> 22:17.406
Thanks so much for coming in Louis.

22:17.411 --> 22:20.410
We're all really excited
about this project.

22:21.410 --> 22:22.405
Me, too.

22:22.410 --> 22:23.406
Everybody wins! Take care.

22:23.411 --> 22:25.410
Thanks, buddy. Good job.

22:27.410 --> 22:28.410
I'll see you in a bit.

22:31.410 --> 22:34.405
I have a relationship with
Julian Pynter. Any objections?

22:34.410 --> 22:35.406
Julian who?

22:35.411 --> 22:37.405
Pynter. Yeah. He's a big deal.

22:37.410 --> 22:39.405
Did uncredited work on
Lethal Limit Three.

22:39.410 --> 22:41.405
Wrote Consequence, Braithwaite Park...

22:41.410 --> 22:42.406
Hey. Fine by me.

22:42.411 --> 22:44.405
Hold on, are w...

22:44.410 --> 22:47.410
Are we talking about firing Louis?

22:49.410 --> 22:51.832
It's a bit rash, isn't
this? Just 'cause he's...

22:56.822 --> 22:57.822
Yeah, all right.

22:59.410 --> 23:00.406
Gladys.

23:00.411 --> 23:02.405
- Yes.
- Poster.

23:02.410 --> 23:04.405
I left a message with facilities.

23:04.410 --> 23:06.405
Wait, wait, wait. Look
at this. Look at this.

23:06.410 --> 23:09.405
I can hang from it.
I'm hanging. See this?

23:09.410 --> 23:12.405
Yeah, I think they
welded it to the wall.

23:12.410 --> 23:13.570
When did you make that movie?

23:14.410 --> 23:18.410
20 years ago. Ambitious
film, cost a fortune.

23:19.410 --> 23:20.406
Everybody hated it.

23:20.411 --> 23:22.405
But I learned something from it.

23:22.410 --> 23:25.405
I realized, what the
hell am I trying to prove?

23:25.410 --> 23:27.405
With age comes wisdom, Gladys.

23:27.410 --> 23:28.410
It's good to know.

23:29.410 --> 23:31.405
What's that?

23:31.410 --> 23:33.405
List of potential directors from
the studio. I can roll calls.

23:33.410 --> 23:34.406
No, no. No, no.

23:34.411 --> 23:36.410
I got another call I want you to make.

23:40.410 --> 23:42.405
Yeah?

23:42.410 --> 23:44.405
I have producer
Rick Moreweather calling for Amara.

23:44.410 --> 23:46.410
This is Amara.

23:47.410 --> 23:49.405
Amara, hi. Hi, it's Rick.

23:49.410 --> 23:52.405
Yes, we, we, we met a few days ago.

23:52.410 --> 23:55.405
Listen, I know you're
in touch with Miles.

23:55.410 --> 23:57.405
I just thought I would reach out.

23:57.410 --> 23:58.406
Okay, Ricky.

23:58.411 --> 24:01.405
Yeah, well, so, I have a number
of projects that I'm producing.

24:01.410 --> 24:04.405
And given how well we
did the first time around,

24:04.410 --> 24:07.405
and your passion for cinema,

24:07.410 --> 24:09.410
maybe you want to produce another movie?

24:10.410 --> 24:12.405
Yes.

24:12.410 --> 24:15.405
Yes, okay. Okay, great.

24:15.410 --> 24:19.405
I have a script. It's,
um, Gates of Dawn.

24:19.410 --> 24:22.405
This, it's a true story.

24:22.410 --> 24:23.406
It, it's set in Hanoi...

24:23.410 --> 24:26.404
We do this after we finish
the first movie, yes?

24:27.301 --> 24:30.317
Well, did Miles tell you...

24:30.381 --> 24:33.545
Gravity Pictures acquired
Admiral's Mistress?

24:34.410 --> 24:35.406
Gravity Pictures...

24:35.411 --> 24:37.410
Yes, you know. They're,
they're buying you out.

24:38.410 --> 24:40.405
They what?

24:40.410 --> 24:43.405
They're buying out your,
your distribution rights,

24:43.410 --> 24:45.405
which, it means you've
already made a profit.

24:45.410 --> 24:46.690
We just don't know how much yet.

24:47.410 --> 24:49.405
I'm out?

24:49.410 --> 24:52.405
Which is why I'm calling, so
we can set up our next thing.

24:52.410 --> 24:53.410
Why am I out?

24:55.410 --> 24:58.405
Well, it's, it's complicated.

24:58.410 --> 25:03.405
It's... A studio came in, and
it became a bigger picture.

25:03.410 --> 25:06.410
And, and they don't want
to coproduce, so...

25:07.410 --> 25:09.405
Does Miles know?

25:09.410 --> 25:10.406
Does he know that they bought you out?

25:10.411 --> 25:12.405
Yes. Yeah, he knows.

25:12.410 --> 25:15.405
He... I'm sure he was gonna call you,

25:15.410 --> 25:19.410
and... Hello?

25:21.410 --> 25:23.405
I didn't have time to
prepare. If you'd let me know.

25:23.410 --> 25:24.481
If you'd give me some headsup, I'd...

25:24.505 --> 25:26.537
Lulu, Lulu. Look here, this
is how it works, all right?

25:26.561 --> 25:27.637
Somebody writes the script and then they

25:27.661 --> 25:28.164
get somebody else to do the rewrite.

25:28.411 --> 25:30.405
Why do you care?

25:30.410 --> 25:31.812
You could have stuck up for me.

25:32.410 --> 25:34.405
Well, I did think about it.

25:34.410 --> 25:36.410
But then I remembered,
you're not a fucking writer.

25:37.410 --> 25:38.406
How are you gonna do a rewrite?

25:38.411 --> 25:41.405
Look at that. That
is a beautiful car.

25:41.410 --> 25:42.406
You know, even if you do lease,

25:42.411 --> 25:45.405
I don't know see how
you can afford that.

25:45.410 --> 25:46.406
And I would not go electric.

25:46.411 --> 25:48.410
What happens if the battery runs out?

25:49.410 --> 25:50.406
You fucking charge it.

25:50.411 --> 25:52.405
What if there's no charger?

25:52.410 --> 25:54.405
Seriously, I mean you got to...

25:54.410 --> 25:56.410
You know, you got the
suit and the car and the...

25:58.410 --> 25:59.406
I think you're trying too hard.

25:59.411 --> 26:02.405
Well, no one's gonna accuse you of that.

26:02.410 --> 26:04.405
What's that mean?

26:04.410 --> 26:07.405
Look, you don't like
the whole LA thing. Fine.

26:07.410 --> 26:10.410
But if this is gonna work at least
one of us needs to raise our game.

26:12.410 --> 26:14.405
Okay, well, I said
that I'd come out here

26:14.410 --> 26:16.405
until you were on your feet.

26:16.410 --> 26:19.405
And clearly you are.

26:19.410 --> 26:20.406
I'm not even the writer anymore,

26:20.411 --> 26:22.405
so maybe I'll head back
to Pahrump tomorrow.

26:22.410 --> 26:23.406
No. Hold on. Hold on. Louis.

26:23.411 --> 26:27.410
Mercedes makes a jeep?
Now that's a fucking car!

26:36.410 --> 26:39.410
- Good Afternoon.
- Hey. Thank you.

26:45.410 --> 26:47.405
Amara! Hi.

26:47.410 --> 26:48.406
I call to see what's
happening with my movie.

26:48.411 --> 26:51.405
You want an update, of course.

26:51.410 --> 26:56.405
Um, let me think, we
brought on a new writer.

26:56.410 --> 26:58.665
Yeah, I mean, the script was solid but

26:58.697 --> 26:59.405
there's always room for improvement.

26:59.410 --> 27:02.405
And I thought it would be a good
idea to make that Felton character

27:02.410 --> 27:03.406
a little more sympathetic.

27:03.411 --> 27:05.405
That got me thinking of Julian Pynter,

27:05.410 --> 27:06.406
I don't know if you're
familiar with his work.

27:06.411 --> 27:09.405
He's a big, awardwinning writer

27:09.410 --> 27:11.405
and, Julian said yes.

27:11.410 --> 27:13.405
So that's exciting.

27:13.410 --> 27:14.410
And, um...

27:16.410 --> 27:17.410
That's pretty much it.

27:18.410 --> 27:20.405
That's it?

27:20.410 --> 27:22.410
For now, yeah.

27:23.410 --> 27:25.405
Thank you for telling me.

27:25.410 --> 27:26.405
Sure. Sure.

27:26.410 --> 27:27.410
Hello?

27:53.410 --> 27:55.405
Hi. I'm Miles.

27:55.410 --> 27:57.405
Hi, Miles. Nice to meet you. I'm Sarah.

27:57.410 --> 27:58.406
Sarah? I feel like we've met before, no?

27:58.411 --> 28:02.405
You seen the bathroom here? The
urinal is an actual waterfall.

28:02.410 --> 28:03.406
Wait. Don't... Why would you...

28:03.411 --> 28:05.405
- Was I interrupting?
- Yeah.

28:05.410 --> 28:08.410
She's not your type.
Look at this. Here you go.

28:09.410 --> 28:11.410
From Stamos, with love.

28:12.410 --> 28:14.405
Wait. This is, this is great.

28:14.410 --> 28:17.405
Thanks for doing, it's
not fucking real, is it?

28:17.410 --> 28:19.405
Like Amara's gonna know the difference.

28:19.410 --> 28:21.405
Did you at least go online and
see if that's his autograph?

28:21.410 --> 28:26.405
You're overthinking it. Come on,
let me introduce you to a few folks.

28:26.410 --> 28:28.405
I can't give this to her.

28:28.410 --> 28:31.405
Your forgery standards are
much higher than mine, I guess.

28:31.410 --> 28:34.405
How about this place,
Fucking crazy.

28:34.410 --> 28:35.406
When did men get so pretty?

28:35.411 --> 28:38.237
The, let me get rid of this.

28:40.410 --> 28:41.406
Thank you, guys.

28:41.411 --> 28:43.405
Hey, who's the, who's
the bald guy over there?

28:43.410 --> 28:45.405
He looks important.

28:45.410 --> 28:47.405
That guy... Yeah, he used
to run Warner Brothers.

28:47.410 --> 28:49.405
We don't get along, me and him.

28:49.410 --> 28:50.406
Come on.

28:50.411 --> 28:52.405
This woman here in the blue...

28:52.410 --> 28:54.405
- Yeah?
- She's the, VP of Fox Searchlight.

28:54.410 --> 28:56.405
- No shit.
- She slapped me once.

28:58.410 --> 29:01.405
Listen, I overheard two
conversations about our movie,

29:01.410 --> 29:03.405
and someone's already
threatened to sue us.

29:03.410 --> 29:05.405
This is how you know
it's hot. It's hot now.

29:05.410 --> 29:07.405
Someone want to sue us?

29:07.410 --> 29:09.405
Yeah, some, Thank you.

29:09.410 --> 29:11.405
Whacko called the office.

29:11.410 --> 29:13.405
You know, "Boyfriend wrote the script"

29:13.410 --> 29:15.405
"and you're stealing it from us."

29:15.410 --> 29:17.410
Did she leave a name?

29:18.410 --> 29:20.405
The boyfriend's name? I don't know.

29:20.410 --> 29:22.405
Owen, or something.
Gladys took the call.

29:22.410 --> 29:24.405
That's funny. And that happened today?

29:24.410 --> 29:26.405
- Before. When we were...
- Look at here!

29:26.410 --> 29:28.405
The creative dream team!

29:28.410 --> 29:30.405
- Ms. Quinn.
- Enjoying yourself?

29:30.410 --> 29:32.405
Celebrating the week I've had.

29:32.410 --> 29:36.405
Maybe you heard, Brandon took
me off Lethal Limit Four.

29:36.410 --> 29:37.406
No. Why?

29:37.411 --> 29:39.405
Well, to focus on The
Admiral's Mistress, silly!

29:39.410 --> 29:42.405
Since that's where my passion lies.

29:42.410 --> 29:45.405
And he doesn't want me
spreading myself too thin.

29:45.410 --> 29:47.405
- Shit. April, I'm sorry.
- No, you're not.

29:47.410 --> 29:49.944
You have a schadenfreude hardon.

29:50.410 --> 29:52.405
That sounds painful.

29:52.410 --> 29:55.410
Excuse me, guys. I gotta see what
it feels like to piss in a waterfall.

29:58.410 --> 30:01.405
You're indispensable to that company.

30:01.410 --> 30:03.405
In another week, you're
gonna have a big film.

30:03.410 --> 30:05.405
Yes, I will.

30:05.410 --> 30:06.275
And you'll still be a sad, washedup

30:06.281 --> 30:07.405
hack living in your father's shadow.

30:07.410 --> 30:10.410
Do you want another
martini? I'm gonna get one.

30:14.410 --> 30:17.405
Was that necessary?

30:17.410 --> 30:19.405
Wait. Does she think
Owen wrote the script

30:19.410 --> 30:20.406
or can she prove it?

30:20.411 --> 30:22.405
No, she seems pretty sure.

30:22.410 --> 30:25.405
You wanna handle it? I
think Gladys has her number.

30:25.410 --> 30:30.405
Hey, asshole. You want
to conduct business?

30:30.410 --> 30:32.410
I think you should go somewhere else.

30:33.410 --> 30:35.405
Fuck off.

30:35.410 --> 30:38.410
Yeah. Give Gladys a call and
get right back to me, okay?

30:42.410 --> 30:44.405
Problem, old man?

30:44.410 --> 30:47.405
I come here to look at the
ocean, now I'm looking at you.

30:47.410 --> 30:49.405
You stand before me
talking on the phone,

30:49.410 --> 30:52.405
like I need to hear
that kind of bullshit.

30:52.410 --> 30:53.405
Well, I'm off it now.

30:53.410 --> 30:54.770
Yeah, so why don't you move along?

30:58.410 --> 31:00.405
If you want to get a
better look at the ocean,

31:00.410 --> 31:02.410
I could always pitch you
over the fuckin' cliff.

31:04.410 --> 31:05.410
Yeah?

31:06.410 --> 31:08.405
That's your house?

31:08.410 --> 31:09.410
No, I'm at a party.

31:10.410 --> 31:12.405
I hate parties.

31:12.410 --> 31:14.410
Well, you seem like
such a people person.

31:15.410 --> 31:18.410
Yeah. I am. Hafdis.

31:21.410 --> 31:23.405
Miles.

31:23.410 --> 31:27.410
I'm sorry. My hands are a
little clammy. You know, so...

31:29.410 --> 31:31.405
You from around here, Hafdis?

31:31.410 --> 31:33.405
Yeah. That way.

31:33.410 --> 31:34.406
That way?

31:34.411 --> 31:36.405
Yeah.

31:36.410 --> 31:37.410
Okay.

31:39.410 --> 31:43.410
And, you, you're
entertainment business, right?

31:45.410 --> 31:47.405
I'm pretending to be a movie producer.

31:47.410 --> 31:48.905
Yeah?

31:48.992 --> 31:49.992
How about you?

31:50.246 --> 31:51.857
I was in New Zealand for quite a while.

31:52.087 --> 31:55.410
Now I'm here, trying to
outwit the hounds of folly.

31:56.410 --> 31:58.405
How's that going?

31:58.410 --> 32:00.410
How's the movieproducing going?

32:01.410 --> 32:04.405
I don't have a fucking
clue what I'm doing.

32:04.410 --> 32:05.850
But it doesn't seem to be a problem.

32:08.410 --> 32:09.410
You want a smoke?

32:10.410 --> 32:12.405
I got these.

32:12.410 --> 32:14.656
But he's not a bad doctor,
he's just behind the curve.

32:15.410 --> 32:17.405
And the Gummy Bear
option is more cohesive.

32:17.410 --> 32:19.405
It's formstable.

32:19.410 --> 32:21.887
But Consadine goes with the
traditional implants, always.

32:21.959 --> 32:23.191
You know, like there's one answer for

32:23.197 --> 32:25.405
all the different women who come in.

32:31.410 --> 32:32.410
What?

32:34.410 --> 32:37.405
No, I'm good. I'm good.

32:37.410 --> 32:40.405
No. Stop saying you're
good. You are not good.

32:40.410 --> 32:41.406
I'm fine.

32:41.411 --> 32:43.410
Jeffrey...

32:44.410 --> 32:46.405
Something happened.

32:46.410 --> 32:47.410
What?

32:49.410 --> 32:50.406
When I went to Miles' place...

32:50.411 --> 32:52.405
- Fuck. What did he do?
- He didn't do anything.

32:52.410 --> 32:56.405
- Be honest.
- And Miles is the one who saved me.

32:56.410 --> 32:59.405
He had this, um, like, a neighbor.

32:59.410 --> 33:02.405
And I blocked the guy in with my car...

33:02.410 --> 33:05.405
And he went insane.

33:05.410 --> 33:08.405
Like, he pulled out a gun. And then...

33:08.410 --> 33:09.410
Shit.

33:10.410 --> 33:12.405
The TKfivenine.

33:12.410 --> 33:15.405
- What?
- That's my golf club.

33:15.410 --> 33:17.410
He jammed the grip into my mouth...

33:20.411 --> 33:22.410
I can still taste the Gortex.

33:27.410 --> 33:32.405
It's about how we all carry around
this image of a, of a better person.

33:32.410 --> 33:37.405
You know what we think, "If I can
be that person, I'll be happy."

33:37.410 --> 33:40.410
But all it does is fucking
drive us crazy. You know?

33:42.410 --> 33:44.405
The Admiral's...

33:44.410 --> 33:47.405
Mistress. Sorry if this is boring you.

33:48.411 --> 33:50.405
Shit. I better take this.

33:50.410 --> 33:51.962
Yeah, please do.

33:53.410 --> 33:54.159
Hey.

33:54.165 --> 33:56.405
I can't do it, Miles.

33:56.410 --> 33:57.406
What?

33:57.411 --> 33:59.405
This, I can't do it. I can't.

33:59.410 --> 34:01.405
It seems like every time I
get this far, we're back...

34:01.410 --> 34:03.405
- All right. Slow down, Katie.
- I talked with Jeffrey.

34:03.410 --> 34:05.405
I know what happened with the golf club.

34:05.410 --> 34:07.410
And don't tell me it was a neighbor.

34:08.409 --> 34:10.405
- Miles...
- It was Yago. Okay.

34:10.409 --> 34:13.405
It was Yago. But I stopped
it as soon as I could.

34:13.409 --> 34:15.405
I know that you're trying.

34:15.409 --> 34:17.405
I know it. But I...

34:17.409 --> 34:21.409
I can't have this in my
life and neither can Emma.

34:23.409 --> 34:27.405
Okay. All right. Well, um,
let's, let's talk about it.

34:27.409 --> 34:30.405
We have.

34:30.409 --> 34:32.409
And we've tried the separation thing,

34:33.409 --> 34:35.405
but maybe it's time for lawyers.

34:35.409 --> 34:37.405
No, no. No, no, no, no. Hold, hold on.

34:37.409 --> 34:38.406
Hold on, Katie.

34:38.411 --> 34:40.405
We'll get into it later, but
that's what I called to say.

34:40.409 --> 34:41.406
- All right. Just wait.
- I'm sorry.

34:41.411 --> 34:43.409
Katie? Katie?

34:45.409 --> 34:48.405
Fuck.

34:49.409 --> 34:50.405
Hi, this is Katie...

34:50.409 --> 34:51.409
Fuck.

34:55.409 --> 34:58.410
- It was...
- Nice meeting you, too.

35:10.410 --> 35:13.405
Got an address for the girlfriend.

35:13.410 --> 35:14.406
Great.

35:14.411 --> 35:17.405
We should head over before it gets late,

35:17.410 --> 35:19.405
or she's not gonna answer the door.

35:19.410 --> 35:22.405
Yeah. Lulu...

35:22.410 --> 35:24.405
What?

35:24.410 --> 35:27.405
Maybe we don't drop
another body right now.

35:27.410 --> 35:30.410
You know? Could make things
trickier down the line.

35:31.410 --> 35:33.405
Fuck yeah, it could.

35:33.410 --> 35:34.406
Believe me, if we had a choice, I...

35:34.411 --> 35:36.405
Listen, the girlfriend
didn't call the cops, did she?

35:36.410 --> 35:38.405
She called the fucking movie studio.

35:38.410 --> 35:40.405
Which is not usually how
you behave when you think

35:40.410 --> 35:42.405
someone's killed your boyfriend.

35:42.410 --> 35:43.406
I don't know.

35:43.411 --> 35:45.405
She thinks that somebody
stole his script.

35:45.410 --> 35:46.781
So all we need to do is come up with a

35:46.787 --> 35:48.405
reasonable explanation
for what happened.

35:48.410 --> 35:50.405
Okay, you're making
this more complicated.

35:50.410 --> 35:53.405
So we tell her, um...

35:53.410 --> 35:55.405
No, I can't come with you.

35:55.410 --> 35:58.405
- Come on.
- I can't, I've to drive to Nevada.

35:58.410 --> 36:00.591
- Now?
- For fuck's sake!

36:02.410 --> 36:03.410
It...

36:07.410 --> 36:09.405
It's all gone to shit with Katie,

36:09.410 --> 36:11.405
and I feel like if I don't...

36:11.410 --> 36:13.410
If I wait, I don't know
what's gonna happen.

36:16.410 --> 36:18.405
Yeah. That's fine. That's...

36:18.410 --> 36:20.405
You go take care of Katie,

36:20.410 --> 36:22.410
and I'll handle the girlfriend.

36:27.410 --> 36:30.405
I'm sorry for that nonsense
at the car dealership.

36:30.410 --> 36:33.405
That was, you don't
need to up your game.

36:33.410 --> 36:34.406
Your game is up.

36:34.411 --> 36:38.405
Don't worry about it. You should go.

36:38.410 --> 36:40.405
Yeah. Four hours.

36:40.410 --> 36:44.405
And it's bullshit that they
brought on another writer. It is.

36:44.410 --> 36:46.405
Just stick around, Lou.
We'll find something else

36:46.410 --> 36:48.405
for you to do on the movie, okay?

36:48.410 --> 36:49.410
It's up to you.

36:51.410 --> 36:53.405
So, wait, wait, wait, now...

36:53.410 --> 36:55.405
What am I telling this woman?

36:55.410 --> 36:56.410
You're the writer.

37:27.410 --> 37:29.410
Just had dinner at Molly's.

37:31.410 --> 37:33.410
Guess who I'm lookin' at right now?

37:35.410 --> 37:36.406
My question is to you,

37:36.411 --> 37:38.405
is how do you find your inspiration?

37:41.187 --> 37:43.405
Who is it?

37:43.410 --> 37:45.410
Louis. You don't know me.

37:46.410 --> 37:48.410
I, I'm a friend of Owen's.

37:54.410 --> 37:55.406
Caroline?

37:55.411 --> 37:57.405
Yeah.

37:57.410 --> 37:58.406
I know that you're looking for Owen,

37:58.411 --> 38:02.405
and I owe you an explanation.

38:02.410 --> 38:03.406
How'd you get my address?

38:03.411 --> 38:05.405
Well, from your phone
number. I tried call you...

38:05.410 --> 38:07.405
How'd you get my phone number?

38:07.410 --> 38:10.405
You gave it to the production office.

38:10.410 --> 38:13.405
That Louis. Your name
is on the screenplay.

38:13.410 --> 38:14.406
You know where Owen is?

38:14.411 --> 38:17.405
Can I come inside and we'll talk?

38:17.410 --> 38:18.410
No.

38:19.410 --> 38:23.204
Well, so I'm, I'm a screenwriter.

38:23.210 --> 38:25.083
And Owen was a friend of mine.

38:25.099 --> 38:26.405
And I used to give
him all my screenplays

38:26.410 --> 38:31.405
so that he could read them and
just tell me what he thought, and...

38:31.410 --> 38:34.410
I found out that Owen was...

38:37.410 --> 38:40.410
He was taking my scripts, and
he was giving them to girls.

38:41.410 --> 38:44.405
You know, to get laid...

38:44.410 --> 38:45.406
What?

38:45.411 --> 38:47.410
So when you called
the production office,

38:48.410 --> 38:50.410
I just figured I should tell you.

38:52.410 --> 38:56.405
Okay, then. All right, sorry. Take care.

38:56.410 --> 38:58.405
Wait. You came here
to give me that story?

38:58.410 --> 39:02.405
I mean, that is fucking ridiculous.

39:02.410 --> 39:04.405
I'm just telling you what happened.

39:04.410 --> 39:08.410
Well, then I have questions.

39:34.410 --> 39:36.410
- Come outside.
- No.

39:37.410 --> 39:39.044
I drove from LA.

39:43.410 --> 39:45.405
What the fuck?

39:45.410 --> 39:47.405
I didn't wanna wake Emma.

39:47.410 --> 39:48.410
Jeffrey is here.

39:49.410 --> 39:50.406
He's in bed?

39:50.411 --> 39:52.405
Yes, in bed. He's sleeping.

39:52.410 --> 39:54.410
I didn't see his car.

39:55.410 --> 39:57.405
Come outside and talk to me, will ya?

39:57.410 --> 39:58.410
No.

40:00.410 --> 40:03.410
Well, I'm not going
anywhere until you do.

40:10.410 --> 40:12.405
- Whose car is this?
- I leased it.

40:13.411 --> 40:15.410
Call this, seemed like
a good idea at the time.

40:16.410 --> 40:17.406
And the suit?

40:17.411 --> 40:19.405
I was at a fundraiser in Malibu.

40:19.410 --> 40:22.405
And tomorrow, I have a photoshoot
for the Trades which is like with...

40:22.410 --> 40:24.410
- Miles.
- I'm sorry about Jeffrey.

40:26.410 --> 40:27.406
- He's traumatized.
- Yeah.

40:27.411 --> 40:30.405
Takes him two milligrams of
Xanax just to fall asleep.

40:30.410 --> 40:32.405
- And that's terrible.
- Yes.

40:32.410 --> 40:35.405
Which is why you and
Emma should come to LA,

40:35.410 --> 40:36.406
to get away from lunatics like Yago.

40:36.411 --> 40:40.410
It's not about Nevada. It's about you.

40:52.410 --> 40:56.405
I always thought we'd make it.

40:56.410 --> 40:59.405
You know, even when I moved out
I thought, "No, they'll be..."

40:59.410 --> 41:01.410
"It'll all fuckin'..."

41:05.410 --> 41:08.405
You want me to stay out
of your way, I'll do it.

41:08.410 --> 41:10.405
I promise, I will.

41:10.410 --> 41:12.405
But just know that everything I'm doing,

41:12.410 --> 41:15.405
all I'm going through right now
is so that you can tell people

41:15.410 --> 41:17.410
what Emma's dad does for a living.

41:18.410 --> 41:21.410
And I'm sorry about Jeffrey, I am.

41:22.410 --> 41:23.946
I don't know what to do.

41:26.410 --> 41:28.410
Maybe I could send him a gift basket.

41:30.410 --> 41:32.410
A gift basket would be nice.

41:34.410 --> 41:36.405
If you're in love with this guy

41:36.410 --> 41:39.405
then I don't wanna be
the one who fucks it up.

41:39.410 --> 41:42.410
In love?

41:48.410 --> 41:49.410
Aren't you?

41:50.410 --> 41:52.410
I'm just trying to get over you.

41:58.410 --> 42:00.100
So, you're not over me?

42:07.410 --> 42:09.405
Should we make out now?

42:09.410 --> 42:11.405
Or is it a bit strange
with your boyfriend in bed?

42:11.410 --> 42:13.410
- Hold on, Katie? Katie?
- Goodnight.

42:15.410 --> 42:17.010
Can you just give
this to Emma, will you?

42:18.410 --> 42:19.406
What is it?

42:19.411 --> 42:21.405
Acting lessons.

42:21.410 --> 42:25.082
Thought it would, you know, help
her confidence before the movie.

42:26.410 --> 42:27.879
It's in LA.

42:30.410 --> 42:33.410
Acting lessons are a bit
limited around here, so...

42:34.410 --> 42:36.410
We'll talk about it later.

42:42.410 --> 42:46.405
I think when he found out
that my movie was getting made,

42:46.410 --> 42:48.405
he knew the jig was up.

42:48.410 --> 42:51.405
And that you were gonna find
out the truth. So he split.

42:51.410 --> 42:54.405
When did he start showing your
scripts around, do you know?

42:54.410 --> 43:00.405
Yeah. It's been
happening for years. Years.

43:00.410 --> 43:04.405
I mean, there'd be a, a different
script for a different girl.

43:04.410 --> 43:08.405
You know. God. I'm sor, I'm sorry.

43:08.410 --> 43:10.405
I didn't mean to offend you.

43:10.410 --> 43:14.410
I'm sure that whatever was between
you and him that was really special.

43:15.410 --> 43:17.405
What a psychopath.

43:17.410 --> 43:21.405
I mean, if you'd seen him
talking about character arcs

43:21.410 --> 43:25.405
and research. So creepy.

43:25.410 --> 43:26.406
I blame myself.

43:26.411 --> 43:28.405
Why?

43:28.410 --> 43:30.405
Because I knew what was happening,

43:30.410 --> 43:33.405
and I called him on it. But
I just thought, you know,

43:33.410 --> 43:35.405
as long as he's just giving
the scripts to these girls,

43:35.410 --> 43:40.405
you know, I mean...
What's it matter?

43:40.410 --> 43:44.410
But I see now that it
was really causing damage.

43:45.410 --> 43:47.410
Real damage.

43:49.410 --> 43:51.410
I just hope you can forgive me.

43:53.410 --> 43:55.405
Okay.

43:55.410 --> 43:57.405
Well, I'm glad you came by.

43:57.410 --> 44:01.410
I still don't know where my
car is, if you can believe that.

44:02.410 --> 44:04.410
But, um... Thank you.

44:07.410 --> 44:09.405
Okay.

44:09.410 --> 44:10.406
All right. Be well, Caroline.

44:10.411 --> 44:12.410
Okay. Okay, you too.

44:23.410 --> 44:24.406
Hey.

44:24.411 --> 44:26.405
My grandmother used to say,

44:26.410 --> 44:29.405
"Choices are like the
branches of an oak tree."

44:29.410 --> 44:32.405
That's nice.

44:32.410 --> 44:33.406
Yeah, it's in the script.

44:33.411 --> 44:38.410
I mean, Owen got that from
me. So, like, how did it...

45:31.411 --> 45:33.405
Still alive?

45:33.410 --> 45:35.410
I thought you wanted to speak to him.

45:37.410 --> 45:39.410
If you don't, I'll, I'll finish up.

45:41.410 --> 45:42.410
I come in.

45:48.410 --> 45:50.410
Someone's here to see you.

45:57.410 --> 45:59.405
I tell you I love the script.

45:59.410 --> 46:01.410
Muy romantico.

46:02.227 --> 46:04.136
And what did you do?

46:05.410 --> 46:06.405
You push me out.

46:06.410 --> 46:07.406
No.

46:07.411 --> 46:09.405
But Rick tell me...

46:09.410 --> 46:12.405
She's the first to put money
into your movie, stupid.

46:12.410 --> 46:13.406
Before the studio.

46:13.411 --> 46:17.410
No. I, I didn't know it
myself until recently.

46:19.410 --> 46:22.410
I don't think that they sorted
out the details yet, Amara.

46:23.410 --> 46:25.405
George?

46:25.410 --> 46:28.405
We verified with Business
Affairs at Gravity Pictures,

46:28.410 --> 46:30.405
the budget is now 30 million.

46:30.410 --> 46:32.431
They're planning a
full buyout of Amara's

46:32.437 --> 46:34.405
distribution rights at 16 percent

46:34.410 --> 46:36.405
above her initial investment.

46:36.410 --> 46:37.406
You made money.

46:37.411 --> 46:39.410
But I don't want to be out.

46:40.410 --> 46:41.406
You did it behind my back.

46:41.411 --> 46:45.912
I didn't. I just, I didn't have a say.

46:46.410 --> 46:48.405
George?

46:48.410 --> 46:49.406
As executive producers,

46:49.411 --> 46:53.410
you and your partner formed
an LLC. It's your decision.

46:54.410 --> 46:56.410
Well, I wasn't aware of that George.

46:59.410 --> 47:01.410
I'm pretty new to this, you know?

47:03.410 --> 47:04.410
Are we done?

47:06.410 --> 47:08.405
We're done.

47:08.410 --> 47:09.410
No.

47:10.410 --> 47:12.405
Amara?

47:16.410 --> 47:21.405
Fuck! Stamos! I got a
photograph of John Stamos.

47:21.410 --> 47:23.405
He, he, he signed it
for you and everything.

47:23.410 --> 47:24.406
Amara?

47:24.411 --> 47:26.410
Give me the knife.

47:28.410 --> 47:30.222
You got a photo?

47:31.410 --> 47:34.410
Yeah. In my pocket.

47:46.410 --> 47:48.410
Autografo.

47:50.410 --> 47:54.405
"Amara, can't wait to meet you.

47:54.410 --> 47:58.405
"Rick..." What's this?

47:58.410 --> 48:00.405
- "Sings your praises."
- Sing your praises.

48:00.410 --> 48:03.410
"Rick sings praises. All my love,."

48:05.410 --> 48:06.410
"John Stamos."

48:13.410 --> 48:14.410
I like this.

48:15.410 --> 48:18.410
I'm glad.

48:24.410 --> 48:26.405
Movie is 30 million now.

48:26.410 --> 48:29.410
How come I only can put in two million?

48:30.410 --> 48:32.405
I don't follow.

48:32.410 --> 48:33.410
I want to put in four.

48:34.410 --> 48:36.410
- Tia, you joking?
- Shh!

48:39.410 --> 48:41.914
Yes or no?

48:43.410 --> 48:45.410
Bigger budget, you could lose money.

48:46.410 --> 48:48.410
I don't lose money.

48:50.410 --> 48:52.405
All right, then.

48:52.410 --> 48:54.405
Yeah. I mean, if it's
up to me like you say

48:54.410 --> 48:59.405
then I'll just call the studio
and I'll say Amara's back on,

48:59.410 --> 49:02.405
and now she's in for
four million. No problem.

49:02.410 --> 49:04.691
Seriously, you gonna throw away
your money like that, Tia?

49:32.410 --> 49:34.410
John Stamos is a nice man.

49:36.410 --> 49:38.430
He's a sweetheart.

49:47.410 --> 49:50.405
Morning. You looking for Rick?

49:52.410 --> 49:54.405
Rick!

49:54.410 --> 49:55.410
What?

49:56.410 --> 49:58.405
Hey! Okay.

49:58.410 --> 49:59.406
Well, look, you don't gotta apologize.

49:59.411 --> 50:01.410
- We've all been there.
- Apologize for what?

50:02.410 --> 50:04.405
You don't remember?

50:04.410 --> 50:05.406
What little I remember is plenty.

50:05.411 --> 50:08.405
Yeah, well... The poster?

50:08.410 --> 50:10.656
Yeah, yeah, in that office. Right there.

50:10.662 --> 50:11.405
Okay.

50:11.410 --> 50:14.405
Guy holding a rooster. Get
it the hell outta there.

50:14.410 --> 50:18.405
- Okay...
- Hafdis Snaejornsson.

50:18.410 --> 50:20.405
- What?
- Director Snaejornsson?

50:20.410 --> 50:22.405
No one says it right.

50:22.410 --> 50:23.406
He hasn't made a movie in 10 years,

50:23.411 --> 50:27.405
but the last one he did it got
a standing ovation at Cannes

50:27.410 --> 50:29.405
and won the Palme d'Or.

50:29.410 --> 50:30.406
Okay. Well, from the sound
of it I don't think he...

50:30.411 --> 50:32.410
He asked for the script.

50:33.410 --> 50:35.405
No kidding.

50:35.410 --> 50:38.405
Miles pitched it to him yesterday
on the beach according to CAA.

50:38.410 --> 50:42.405
Hafdis thinks it's
something he might direct.

50:42.410 --> 50:43.410
Can you follow up?

50:44.410 --> 50:46.410
- Okay.
- Thanks.

50:50.410 --> 50:53.410
Good. Good. Good.

50:56.410 --> 50:58.405
Should we call CAA?

50:58.410 --> 51:00.405
No. Not now. Not now.

51:00.410 --> 51:02.405
You're working on pitches
for movies that aren't set up

51:02.410 --> 51:03.406
and this director could move on.

51:03.411 --> 51:05.405
No, he's never gonna do our movie.

51:05.410 --> 51:07.405
He won the Palme d'Or.

51:07.410 --> 51:09.405
- So?
- So, so I have work to do.

51:09.410 --> 51:11.405
Call CAA.

51:11.410 --> 51:12.410
No.

51:15.410 --> 51:16.405
Don't hit me in front of the guy.

51:16.410 --> 51:17.406
Albert, would you excuse us?

51:17.411 --> 51:19.405
No. Don't, I want that down.

51:19.410 --> 51:21.362
And would you please close the door?

51:24.410 --> 51:26.405
Come on.

51:26.410 --> 51:28.405
You made an ambitious movie a
hundred years ago and it shit the bed.

51:28.410 --> 51:30.405
So what?

51:30.411 --> 51:32.384
You should be proud that you tried.

51:33.410 --> 51:37.405
Now call the famous director
and stop being a pussy.

51:37.410 --> 51:41.405
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. You
work for me. You got that?

51:41.410 --> 51:42.405
So don't talk to me like that.

51:42.410 --> 51:43.406
- Pussy.
- Don't. Stop that.

51:43.411 --> 51:46.405
Stop. Stop! All right, stop it!

51:46.410 --> 51:48.405
I'll call!

51:48.410 --> 51:52.405
I'll call, okay? I'm
calling. I'm dialing. See?

51:52.410 --> 51:54.405
Yeah. Good.

51:54.410 --> 51:57.410
You can stop with the
guidance counselor bullshit.

51:59.410 --> 52:00.406
Get the guy.

52:00.411 --> 52:02.405
Albert!

52:02.410 --> 52:03.410
Please, continue.

52:05.410 --> 52:09.405
Hello. This is Rick
Moreweather for Manny Yablonz.

52:09.410 --> 52:10.410
I'll hold.

52:22.410 --> 52:26.410
Hey, yeah, yeah. You
know what, just leave it.

52:27.410 --> 52:30.405
Leave it. It's okay.

52:30.410 --> 52:33.410
Yeah, yeah. Let's just, let's
just leave it there. Thank you.

52:53.410 --> 52:55.405
Food's good here.

52:55.410 --> 52:58.405
What do you like, the cabeza tacos?

52:58.410 --> 53:01.405
Probably exactly why you came, ain't it?

53:01.410 --> 53:02.410
I wanna make a deal.

53:09.410 --> 53:11.405
You wanna make a deal?

53:11.410 --> 53:14.405
You know last time we sat down,

53:14.410 --> 53:17.410
Amara was talking about
cutting all of our legs off.

53:19.410 --> 53:21.410
So far, so good though, right?

53:22.410 --> 53:24.405
Except for your boy.

53:24.410 --> 53:26.405
You know, the one down
there slingin' on Oakridge.

53:26.410 --> 53:29.405
He ain't doing too good, is he?

53:29.410 --> 53:30.410
I'll give you Amara.

53:36.410 --> 53:40.251
If she's gone, most
of her men will flip.

53:41.410 --> 53:44.405
I hand over business and the crew.

53:44.410 --> 53:46.410
But I need a sit down with Josias.

53:48.410 --> 53:50.410
Work out my side of this.

53:56.410 --> 53:58.410
I can't sit here all day.

53:59.410 --> 54:00.840
What's it gonna be?

54:04.410 --> 54:06.410
Just do the best you can with it.

54:09.410 --> 54:11.410
Mr. Daly, have a seat.

54:20.410 --> 54:22.410
I should see the other guy, right?

54:24.410 --> 54:26.405
I was tied up. The other guy's fine.

54:26.410 --> 54:28.405
Let's try those glasses.

54:28.410 --> 54:30.410
Move that light over a little bit.

54:37.410 --> 54:38.406
Movie sounds great by the way.

54:38.411 --> 54:41.410
- Yeah?
- Congratulations.
