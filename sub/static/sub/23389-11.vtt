WEBVTT

00:02.311 --> 00:03.689
Previously on "The Path"...

00:03.689 --> 00:04.775
‐ Why would you choose
a religion

00:04.775 --> 00:06.236
that would never choose you?

00:06.236 --> 00:07.739
‐ It's not just
about the religion, Hawk.

00:07.739 --> 00:09.492
It's about my family.
I‐it's everything.

00:09.492 --> 00:11.204
I will lose everything!

00:11.204 --> 00:13.500
Three women are accusing
you of groping them.

00:13.500 --> 00:14.962
You go.

00:14.962 --> 00:16.381
I can't run a session
like that.

00:16.381 --> 00:17.884
‐ Yes, you can help him
more than I can.

00:17.884 --> 00:19.721
‐ It's time
for the real work to begin.

00:19.721 --> 00:21.474
‐ Okay.

00:21.474 --> 00:23.103
What happened with Steve‐‐
Eddie will end this.

00:23.103 --> 00:24.565
‐ I don't want it
to end either.

00:24.565 --> 00:26.317
All the memories
are in there,

00:26.317 --> 00:28.405
in the cave
with he painted flowers.

00:28.405 --> 00:30.242
I just need to find it.

00:30.242 --> 00:33.039
Sarah and I have decided

00:33.039 --> 00:36.797
that, uh... she will no longer
be a part of The Movement.

00:36.797 --> 00:38.216
‐ Take this.

00:38.216 --> 00:39.970
It's what The Light
revealed to me.

00:39.970 --> 00:42.767
I'm just asking you
to sit down with her.

00:42.767 --> 00:44.938
She has a different story
of the beginning

00:44.938 --> 00:46.149
and the end.
‐ Where is she?

00:46.149 --> 00:47.527
She came out of surgery.

00:47.527 --> 00:49.113
I'm worried
something's happened.

00:49.113 --> 00:51.075
‐ Tell her I want to talk
to her immediately, okay?

00:51.075 --> 00:52.662
‐ So she doesn't know
that Eddie dies.

00:52.662 --> 00:55.208
Lilith is my mother.

00:55.208 --> 00:58.716
‐ You're telling me
that Steve is your father?

00:58.716 --> 01:01.429
‐ He's gonna die soon.
I saw it.

01:52.281 --> 01:53.993
This was amazing,

01:53.993 --> 01:56.999
because three months earlier,
I myself had had a dream

01:56.999 --> 02:01.507
about a man carrying
a pregnant woman through fire.

02:01.507 --> 02:03.511
So, when I overhear this man‐‐

02:03.511 --> 02:05.683
this custodian
in one of my hotels,

02:05.683 --> 02:09.608
a man I have never spoken to
or met in my life‐‐

02:09.608 --> 02:14.450
talking about a man saving
a woman from fire,

02:14.450 --> 02:17.289
it was abundantly
clear to me...

02:17.289 --> 02:22.257
that something remarkable was
presenting itself to me.

02:22.257 --> 02:24.011
Two days later,

02:24.011 --> 02:26.934
I attended my first
Meyerist meeting.

02:26.934 --> 02:29.230
There were hundreds
of people there.

02:29.230 --> 02:31.860
I was overjoyed and shocked.

02:31.860 --> 02:35.743
There were villagers,
shop owners, young kids,

02:35.743 --> 02:37.956
and even a few stiffs
in suits like me.

02:37.956 --> 02:40.460
‐

02:40.460 --> 02:43.007
‐ That night...

02:43.007 --> 02:46.389
was the first time I saw images

02:46.389 --> 02:49.729
of this mythical American...

02:49.729 --> 02:51.357
Eddie Lane.

02:53.152 --> 02:56.869
And when I was first introduced
to The Ladder...

02:58.246 --> 03:00.960
From that moment on...

03:00.960 --> 03:05.427
all I have ever wanted
was to climb.

03:05.427 --> 03:08.391
But, um, we've never
done any outreach

03:08.391 --> 03:10.521
in Asia‐‐none.
‐ I know.

03:10.521 --> 03:12.650
Believe me, I know.

03:12.650 --> 03:15.488
I've long been skeptical
of these missionaries

03:15.488 --> 03:17.785
preying on our people.

03:17.785 --> 03:19.330
When I first encountered
Meyerism,

03:19.330 --> 03:22.419
I was looking for the scam‐‐
the illusion,

03:22.419 --> 03:25.718
the explanation, the strings.

03:25.718 --> 03:30.352
‐ Every so often,
things just happen.

03:30.352 --> 03:32.481
‐ It happened...

03:32.481 --> 03:35.236
because
it cannot be stopped.

03:35.236 --> 03:38.326
The message is spreading...

03:38.326 --> 03:40.288
which is why I...

03:40.288 --> 03:44.088
invited you all here tonight.

03:44.088 --> 03:49.348
This is my resort property
on Kuta Beach.

03:49.348 --> 03:51.728
I would like,
with your permission,

03:51.728 --> 03:56.195
to convert it into the first
Meyerist Center in Asia.

03:56.195 --> 03:57.782
The logistics are under way.

03:57.782 --> 04:00.370
I was too giddy to wait,
I must admit.

04:02.416 --> 04:05.338
And if we stay on schedule,

04:05.338 --> 04:08.094
I would like to unveil it
to you‐‐

04:08.094 --> 04:10.766
to the world...

04:10.766 --> 04:13.689
on the next hunter's moon,
next month.

04:13.689 --> 04:15.818
‐
‐ I'll go.

04:15.818 --> 04:17.572
I mean, look at these beaches.

04:17.572 --> 04:18.824
‐ Right.

04:18.824 --> 04:22.707
‐ I would like
our countrymen...

04:22.707 --> 04:25.170
to learn everything
that Steven Meyer learned

04:25.170 --> 04:27.090
from The Light.

04:27.090 --> 04:28.802
‐ Um... well...

04:28.802 --> 04:32.100
Everything, um, learned
from The Light

04:32.100 --> 04:34.396
belongs to Eddie Lane now.

04:34.396 --> 04:38.321
Anything to be learned
will be taught by Eddie.

04:38.321 --> 04:39.783
‐ Hmm.

04:42.789 --> 04:44.500
‐ To The Light in Bali.

04:44.500 --> 04:48.634
To The Light in Bali.

04:50.095 --> 04:53.017
My mother always told me
that The Movement's growth

04:53.017 --> 04:55.564
would lead to its collapse.

04:57.067 --> 04:59.948
‐ So you're saying
that Bali is a bad idea?

04:59.948 --> 05:01.868
‐ No, um...

05:01.868 --> 05:05.584
‐ Look, Vera, you're not
under your mother's thumb...

05:05.584 --> 05:07.170
anymore.

05:07.170 --> 05:08.590
‐ Yeah, I know that.

05:08.590 --> 05:10.678
It's hard to hear someone be

05:10.678 --> 05:15.353
so 100% certain
about something so terrifying.

05:15.353 --> 05:18.234
‐ Ah, I get that,
but, hey, look,

05:18.234 --> 05:21.323
whatever happens
is going to happen.

05:21.323 --> 05:23.035
I mean, I didn't have
anything to do

05:23.035 --> 05:26.585
with introducing Meyerism
to Bali, but here we are.

05:26.585 --> 05:29.716
I mean, we're going
to fucking Bali.

05:29.716 --> 05:32.304
All right?

05:32.304 --> 05:34.266
Come on.

05:34.266 --> 05:36.855
‐ Hey, Eddie.

05:36.855 --> 05:40.236
Do you‐‐do you think
we'll recover?

05:41.698 --> 05:42.909
‐ Vera.

05:42.909 --> 05:44.913
‐ Yeah, I know. I'm...

05:44.913 --> 05:47.710
I'm sorry. It's just...

05:47.710 --> 05:49.672
y‐you look at me differently.

05:49.672 --> 05:51.258
‐ Hey.

05:51.258 --> 05:53.262
Look, I just don't know
how to look at you

05:53.262 --> 05:56.060
and not make it...

05:56.060 --> 05:57.855
you know, different.

05:59.191 --> 06:02.239
You know, I don't know how
to keep talking about this

06:02.239 --> 06:03.867
or not keep talking about this.

06:03.867 --> 06:05.203
I'm just...

06:05.203 --> 06:06.790
processing.

06:06.790 --> 06:08.585
That's all. Okay?

06:08.585 --> 06:11.090
That's just gonna
take some time.

06:11.090 --> 06:13.261
Okay?
So just give me that.

06:13.261 --> 06:15.683
It's gonna be... great.

06:15.683 --> 06:18.522
‐ Yeah. It will.

06:18.522 --> 06:20.358
‐ It will.

06:20.358 --> 06:22.195
Come here.

06:24.324 --> 06:26.370
We're both wiped.

06:26.370 --> 06:31.088
You have the AL tomorrow.
Let's just get some rest.

06:31.088 --> 06:33.092
‐ Yeah, that'll be good.

06:33.092 --> 06:35.138
‐ Absolutely.

06:37.017 --> 06:38.895
‐ I think there's
someone in there.

06:40.566 --> 06:41.651
‐
Wait, wait, wait.

06:41.651 --> 06:43.446
Stay here.
Okay?

06:43.446 --> 06:45.408
‐ Yeah.
‐ Good.

07:01.983 --> 07:03.110
Jesus!

07:03.110 --> 07:04.446
Hawk!
‐ I'm sorry.

07:04.446 --> 07:05.699
I‐I thought‐‐
‐ What?

07:05.699 --> 07:07.243
‐
I need your keys.

07:07.243 --> 07:09.164
I was looking for your keys
to the Prius lot.

07:09.164 --> 07:11.836
‐ Why didn't you ask first
before breaking in?

07:11.836 --> 07:13.380
‐ 'Cause I thought
you'd say no.

07:13.380 --> 07:16.261
‐ Say no to what?

07:16.261 --> 07:19.226
‐ I got a letter.
It's from Caleb.

07:19.226 --> 07:20.979
Well, I mean, it's not‐‐
it's "from Caleb,"

07:20.979 --> 07:25.154
but it's not from Caleb.
It's...

07:25.154 --> 07:27.910
‐ Hey, Hawk.
‐ Hi, Vera.

07:29.539 --> 07:31.458
‐ Look...

07:31.458 --> 07:33.797
I can tell that you're...

07:33.797 --> 07:36.886
very torn up about whatever's
happening with Caleb.

07:36.886 --> 07:39.099
But you have to promise me

07:39.099 --> 07:42.272
that you will not do
anything like this again.

07:44.151 --> 07:46.321
‐ Yeah.
Okay.

07:46.321 --> 07:48.450
‐ Okay?
‐ Yeah.

07:48.450 --> 07:50.873
Just... read it.

07:58.805 --> 08:01.393
I mean, there's no way
he wrote that.

08:01.393 --> 08:03.189
"I ask you as a friend

08:03.189 --> 08:06.361
to respect my decision
to better myself."

08:06.361 --> 08:09.994
"My commitment to The Light
of this World, Jesus Christ."

08:09.994 --> 08:11.831
What the fuck is that?

08:11.831 --> 08:16.758
He's in trouble there, Dad,
and I have to go help him.

08:16.758 --> 08:19.512
‐ Where?

08:19.512 --> 08:21.141
Maryland?

08:22.477 --> 08:24.941
‐ I need a car.

08:43.102 --> 08:44.897
‐

09:19.424 --> 09:21.554
Five minutes
means five minutes.

09:21.554 --> 09:25.102
500 bucks means five minutes.

09:25.102 --> 09:27.482
‐ How long did you say
since she's been here?

09:27.482 --> 09:31.239
‐ I have no idea.
Where are you going?

09:31.239 --> 09:32.785
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey.

09:32.785 --> 09:34.412
‐ Can you get in the mailbox?

09:34.412 --> 09:36.668
‐ Are you fucking
kidding me, lady?

09:38.337 --> 09:40.676
I'm serious.
Don't push me on this, lady.

09:42.680 --> 09:45.519
Lady, I swear to God...

09:45.519 --> 09:47.523
Are you listening?
Hey, I'm over here!

09:51.989 --> 09:52.991
We're done.
That's it.

09:52.991 --> 09:55.287
Time's up.

09:55.287 --> 09:57.668
I'm talking to you.
Listen to me.

09:57.668 --> 09:59.003
You're out.
We're done.

09:59.003 --> 10:00.005
Let's go.

10:00.005 --> 10:02.009
Now.

10:02.009 --> 10:05.307
Now! Right now! Out!

10:14.910 --> 10:16.496
All right, so this is

10:16.496 --> 10:18.543
what's on the schedule
for the next couple days.

10:18.543 --> 10:20.296
We rescheduled
that podcast thing,

10:20.296 --> 10:21.758
so don't worry about that.
‐ Uh‐huh.

10:21.758 --> 10:23.887
‐ And I'm still getting
some blowback

10:23.887 --> 10:26.308
about the arbitration
contracts.

10:26.308 --> 10:29.690
So, if that flares up
for whatever reason,

10:29.690 --> 10:31.569
just give me a call.

10:31.569 --> 10:33.447
‐ No, if anything comes up,
I'll call you.

10:33.447 --> 10:36.036
‐ Not because I need to know
anything about it, but just...

10:36.036 --> 10:37.539
I don't want you to feel

10:37.539 --> 10:39.585
that you have to put out
these fires on your own.

10:39.585 --> 10:41.296
Not that there's gonna
be any fires,

10:41.296 --> 10:43.843
but just if there are.
‐ I understand.

10:43.843 --> 10:45.262
‐ All right, then.

10:45.262 --> 10:48.645
Um, should be gone just a day,
two tops.

10:48.645 --> 10:50.774
‐ Just you and Hawk?
‐ Yeah.

10:50.774 --> 10:53.487
‐ Nice.
‐ Well, it's, um...

10:53.487 --> 10:57.245
it's Caleb‐related.

10:57.245 --> 10:59.750
His folks sent him

10:59.750 --> 11:03.800
to one of those Christian
re‐education places.

11:03.800 --> 11:05.804
‐ Oh. That is horrible.

11:05.804 --> 11:07.683
It's‐‐that's criminal.

11:07.683 --> 11:10.730
‐ Yeah, well, it should be.
‐ Yeah, it should be.

11:10.730 --> 11:13.485
‐ I don't know what we're
really getting ourselves into,

11:13.485 --> 11:15.991
but, uh, Hawk's pretty adamant.

11:15.991 --> 11:19.038
You know, he has
to talk to him, has to try.

11:19.038 --> 11:21.418
‐ That's really admirable.

11:21.418 --> 11:23.422
‐ Yeah, I agree.

11:23.422 --> 11:25.259
‐ No, I mean‐‐
I mean of you.

11:25.259 --> 11:26.469
‐ Oh, well, no.
‐ It is.

11:26.469 --> 11:28.641
It is.

11:28.641 --> 11:30.979
Even change you believe in
is hard.

11:30.979 --> 11:32.649
You know,
I'm impressed...

11:32.649 --> 11:35.864
father to father.

11:35.864 --> 11:37.701
‐ Thank you.

11:37.701 --> 11:39.955
That's nice of you to say.

11:39.955 --> 11:42.628
Oh, one last thing.

11:42.628 --> 11:46.092
It's the only
special instruction.

11:46.092 --> 11:50.517
Vera is taking
an accelerated AL.

11:50.517 --> 11:52.940
You know, I was
gonna facilitate,

11:52.940 --> 11:55.570
but, you know, she needs this.

11:55.570 --> 11:56.948
‐ Absolutely.

11:56.948 --> 11:58.910
‐ It'd mean a lot to her.

11:58.910 --> 12:01.164
And to me, too.

12:01.164 --> 12:03.460
‐ Of course.

12:03.460 --> 12:05.924
‐ Look...

12:05.924 --> 12:07.761
Cal, I...

12:07.761 --> 12:10.224
trust you completely.

12:10.224 --> 12:11.393
Okay?

12:11.393 --> 12:14.232
I want you to know that.

12:14.232 --> 12:16.696
All right.

12:16.696 --> 12:19.075
Thanks, man.

12:49.803 --> 12:51.514
‐ Hey.
What do you want?

12:51.514 --> 12:52.726
He wants me to
take things over

12:52.726 --> 12:55.732
for a couple of days.

12:55.732 --> 12:58.320
‐ Okay, but you're still gonna
make it to Washington, right?

12:58.320 --> 13:00.992
N‐no, actually, no.
No, I can't.

13:00.992 --> 13:02.746
‐ What?

13:02.746 --> 13:05.835
This is a fucking joke, right?
Harbaugh is expecting us.

13:05.835 --> 13:09.217
‐ I‐I know.
I'm sorry, but this is, um...

13:09.217 --> 13:11.722
You know, I‐I have to stay.

13:11.722 --> 13:14.102
‐ No, you're choosing to.
You're choosing to stay.

13:14.102 --> 13:15.939
You're choosing Eddie over us.

13:15.939 --> 13:18.653
‐
Well, I'll call JP, okay?

13:18.653 --> 13:21.407
I'll call Harbaugh
and, uh‐‐and whoever else

13:21.407 --> 13:22.744
you think I need to call.

13:22.744 --> 13:24.665
I'll handle it.
‐ Oh, you will?

13:24.665 --> 13:27.086
- Okay.
- I will.

13:27.086 --> 13:30.927
And, uh, you know,
I'll grovel, Mary.

13:30.927 --> 13:33.181
You know, I'll them that,
as inconceivable

13:33.181 --> 13:35.144
as it might sound,
the actual Movement

13:35.144 --> 13:37.148
needs my actual attention.

13:37.148 --> 13:39.360
‐ Well, I'm still going.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.991
‐ Um, no‐‐
Well, I mean, I don't know‐‐

13:41.991 --> 13:43.703
I don't know
if that's a good idea.

13:43.703 --> 13:45.748
Harbaugh is‐‐
No, and you there on your own?

13:45.748 --> 13:47.376
‐ Well, I don't think
it's a good idea for you

13:47.376 --> 13:49.046
to do anything
on your own right now,

13:49.046 --> 13:51.635
especially here, what with
all the memory recall

13:51.635 --> 13:55.142
and the weird drawings
of mysterious caves.

13:57.021 --> 13:59.191
- ‐ What about Forest?
- Use the nursery.

13:59.191 --> 14:01.154
We live in a collective
community, remember?

14:11.675 --> 14:13.763
‐

14:15.850 --> 14:17.520
Hey.

14:17.520 --> 14:18.940
‐ I've been calling you
for hours.

14:18.940 --> 14:20.317
Didn't Hawk tell you

14:20.317 --> 14:21.946
that we're driving out
to Maryland?

14:21.946 --> 14:23.699
‐ Yeah, it's‐‐
it's not about that.

14:23.699 --> 14:25.995
- Is he with you now?
- Yeah. He's in the store.

14:25.995 --> 14:27.122
Why?

14:27.122 --> 14:29.085
Is something wrong?

14:29.085 --> 14:32.091
‐ Vera isn't
who she says she is.

14:32.091 --> 14:33.844
‐ Look, I know, okay?

14:33.844 --> 14:36.265
She told me everything.
‐ Wait. You know?

14:36.265 --> 14:39.564
Look, it's really
complicated, Sarah.

14:39.564 --> 14:41.109
‐ Well...

14:41.109 --> 14:43.614
what did she say
she was doing?

14:43.614 --> 14:46.745
‐ She apologized, okay?

14:46.745 --> 14:48.498
And we are trying
to move forward.

14:48.498 --> 14:49.835
Wait. She apologized,

14:49.835 --> 14:51.379
and you didn't think
to tell me?

14:51.379 --> 14:53.759
I've been obsessed
with Lilith for months.

14:53.759 --> 14:57.391
‐ Look, I only just
found this out myself, okay?

14:57.391 --> 14:58.978
Am I supposed
to tell you everything?

14:58.978 --> 15:00.355
‐ Why is she here?

15:00.355 --> 15:04.740
‐ She's becoming
a Meyerist, okay?

15:04.740 --> 15:06.409
Can we just talk
about this later?

15:06.409 --> 15:07.787
Hawk's coming.

15:07.787 --> 15:09.666
Her mother
is missing, Eddie.

15:09.666 --> 15:11.210
Look, I don't know anything

15:11.210 --> 15:13.632
about her mother, okay?
Just let it go.

15:18.058 --> 15:20.020
‐ Who's that?

15:20.020 --> 15:21.481
‐ Your mom says hi.

15:25.740 --> 15:27.409
What did she want?

15:27.409 --> 15:29.998
Just divorce stuff.

15:29.998 --> 15:31.334
It's fine.

15:31.334 --> 15:35.258
Really, it's fine.

15:35.258 --> 15:36.595
‐ It's about Vera?

15:38.014 --> 15:39.183
‐ Mm‐hmm.

15:39.183 --> 15:41.395
‐ Is it real?

15:41.395 --> 15:43.776
‐ What?
‐ You and her.

15:43.776 --> 15:46.239
‐ Yeah, it is.

15:46.239 --> 15:49.328
‐ You don't seem too happy
for a guy in love.

15:52.084 --> 15:54.130
‐ Well, neither do you.

15:57.971 --> 16:00.058
Is that why you came?

16:00.058 --> 16:02.271
Get away from all that stuff?

16:02.271 --> 16:06.655
‐ No, I came because I want
to try to help you out,

16:06.655 --> 16:08.449
if I can.

16:08.449 --> 16:10.328
All right?

16:10.328 --> 16:12.040
It's just...

16:12.040 --> 16:16.550
things have been hard lately
with Vera.

16:16.550 --> 16:18.094
‐ Why?

16:18.094 --> 16:20.223
‐ You just never really know
someone, I guess.

16:20.223 --> 16:22.812
‐ You don't know Vera?

16:22.812 --> 16:24.273
‐ No.

16:24.273 --> 16:28.364
All of us,
we just have so much stuff.

16:28.364 --> 16:30.995
Sometimes that stuff can
make you fall

16:30.995 --> 16:33.667
deeper in love
with that person.

16:33.667 --> 16:36.255
Other times, that stuff...

16:36.255 --> 16:37.717
doesn't make you love
them any less.

16:37.717 --> 16:41.558
It just...

16:41.558 --> 16:45.023
makes you love them
differently.

16:45.023 --> 16:47.987
And that is harder
than it sounds.

16:54.083 --> 16:57.089
‐

16:59.886 --> 17:03.811
‐ Isn't this meant
to be in total darkness?

17:03.811 --> 17:05.564
Hence the term
"Absence of Light"?

17:05.564 --> 17:08.820
Yeah, and typically,
there'd be 20 people with you.

17:08.820 --> 17:11.117
You're doing
the hard‐core version.

17:11.117 --> 17:14.455
But, you know,
this is just a backup.

17:14.455 --> 17:15.751
‐ Hmm.

17:15.751 --> 17:17.755
So, um...

17:17.755 --> 17:20.970
people see things, hmm?

17:20.970 --> 17:22.263
Sometimes?

17:22.263 --> 17:25.185
‐ It's happened, for sure.

17:25.185 --> 17:29.403
Visions,
out‐of‐body experiences.

17:29.403 --> 17:31.950
Whatever has been pushed down

17:31.950 --> 17:34.623
deep into your psyche...

17:34.623 --> 17:36.334
it can come out.

17:37.587 --> 17:39.799
‐ There's a lot in my psyche.

17:39.799 --> 17:41.762
‐ You don't have to do this.

17:41.762 --> 17:44.475
‐ Oh, no, I do.

17:44.475 --> 17:46.395
I need this. I...

17:46.395 --> 17:48.817
have to face things
once and for all,

17:48.817 --> 17:51.990
and I need to break
the connections with...

18:03.639 --> 18:06.060
I wish Eddie was here.

18:09.859 --> 18:13.157
I'm sorry.
I...

18:13.157 --> 18:16.540
I didn't mean...
‐ No, it's‐‐it's fine.

18:16.540 --> 18:17.917
It's fine.

18:17.917 --> 18:19.754
Of course you wish
Eddie was here.

18:19.754 --> 18:21.132
You know?

18:21.132 --> 18:22.927
I‐I wish Eddie was here.

18:22.927 --> 18:25.014
‐ So you wouldn't have
to endure this...

18:25.014 --> 18:27.394
This exact awkward moment

18:27.394 --> 18:29.816
that you're experiencing
right now?

18:29.816 --> 18:32.446
A woman whispering
to the tree

18:32.446 --> 18:34.366
about her boyfriend?
‐ Yeah.

18:34.366 --> 18:36.287
Exactly.
That is exactly why.

18:36.287 --> 18:38.166
‐

18:38.166 --> 18:41.005
Did it help you?

18:41.005 --> 18:43.217
You know, when...

18:43.217 --> 18:46.975
when you did this‐‐your AL?

18:46.975 --> 18:51.818
Did it... did it help you
face some of the past?

18:53.404 --> 18:56.368
‐ Huh.

18:56.368 --> 18:58.247
I...

18:58.247 --> 19:02.464
I literally have
zero recollection

19:02.464 --> 19:04.426
of my own AL.

19:07.057 --> 19:09.311
Isn't that weird?

19:09.311 --> 19:12.150
I‐I've been to the site
dozens of times.

19:12.150 --> 19:16.158
I've made the trip with others,
but‐‐but I can't...

19:19.164 --> 19:23.464
I can't sift through that
to find my own experience.

19:26.428 --> 19:29.476
That, uh...

19:29.476 --> 19:32.190
that saddens me, to be honest.

19:32.190 --> 19:33.861
‐ I'm sorry.

19:35.781 --> 19:37.702
I‐it's...

19:37.702 --> 19:40.916
it's there somewhere, right?

19:40.916 --> 19:43.881
Everything is.

19:43.881 --> 19:46.720
‐
Yeah, everything is.

19:53.734 --> 19:57.282
All right, I trust you will...

19:57.282 --> 19:59.787
focus your meditation

19:59.787 --> 20:02.292
between now and sunrise
tomorrow...

20:04.004 --> 20:06.718
No matter what you end up
doing with this...

20:06.718 --> 20:10.058
this campfire,
but, you know, just in case.

20:10.058 --> 20:11.519
‐ Mm.

20:11.519 --> 20:14.859
No, I, um...

20:14.859 --> 20:16.362
I want to commit.

20:30.724 --> 20:32.352
Are you gonna
let me see her or not?

20:32.352 --> 20:33.605
I know she's here.

20:33.605 --> 20:35.358
She's probably
in Eddie's cabin.

20:35.358 --> 20:36.736
‐ That may be, but you're not
on the visitors list.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.114
‐ Oh, my God.
This is ridiculous.

20:38.114 --> 20:39.826
‐ No visitors
that aren't on the list.

20:39.826 --> 20:41.746
‐ It's not ridiculous.
It's for everyone's safety.

20:41.746 --> 20:43.625
‐ You know what? I have been
a Meyerist my whole life.

20:43.625 --> 20:44.961
‐ Except for right now.

20:44.961 --> 20:46.338
Right now
you're not a Meyerist,

20:46.338 --> 20:47.967
and you're not
on the list, so...

21:25.626 --> 21:26.753
Hey!

21:26.753 --> 21:28.172
I need assistance.

21:28.172 --> 21:29.717
I got an intruder
on the compound.

21:29.717 --> 21:31.095
Vera?
Vera?

21:31.095 --> 21:33.683
I want to talk to you!

21:33.683 --> 21:35.646
You can't be
on the property, ma'am!

21:35.646 --> 21:38.610
‐ I'm not going anywhere
until I talk to Vera!

21:38.610 --> 21:40.404
Vera! Get off‐‐

21:40.404 --> 21:43.787
Leave me alone!
Get off of me!

21:43.787 --> 21:46.416
Take your‐‐don't...
Vera!

21:46.416 --> 21:49.089
Vera! Vera!

21:54.099 --> 21:56.103
We believe that life,

21:56.103 --> 21:57.773
at its essence,
is a series

21:57.773 --> 22:02.115
of habits, rituals, routines.

22:02.115 --> 22:05.789
We do not believe
that wayward souls respond

22:05.789 --> 22:09.881
in any meaningful way
to fear or pain

22:09.881 --> 22:13.137
or torture or...
anything you might've seen

22:13.137 --> 22:14.682
- on "Dateline."
- Hmm.

22:14.682 --> 22:17.395
Waywards require
structure‐‐

22:17.395 --> 22:20.652
social structure,
family structure,

22:20.652 --> 22:22.698
romantic structure.

22:22.698 --> 22:25.829
This keeps their minds
on God's goodness‐‐

22:25.829 --> 22:28.417
which is right
in front of them‐‐

22:28.417 --> 22:31.506
and not on the D word's
sinfulness,

22:31.506 --> 22:36.601
which is around the corner
in some dark alley somewhere.

22:36.601 --> 22:38.730
What denomination are you?

22:38.730 --> 22:40.441
‐ Catholic.
‐ Oh.

22:40.441 --> 22:42.195
That's... okay.

22:42.195 --> 22:43.698
Practicing, I assume?

22:43.698 --> 22:45.409
‐ Of course.
‐ Of course.

22:45.409 --> 22:48.290
And when would you say
Hawk's proclivities

22:48.290 --> 22:49.919
began to reveal themselves?

22:49.919 --> 22:51.589
‐ Um...

22:51.589 --> 22:55.429
‐
It's, uh... it's hard to say.

22:55.429 --> 22:58.310
‐ It's all so hard
to talk about.

22:58.310 --> 22:59.605
It's so icky.

22:59.605 --> 23:03.571
‐ Um, I only
started acting...

23:03.571 --> 23:06.661
on it recently.

23:06.661 --> 23:10.627
‐ But you have acted on it.

23:10.627 --> 23:14.467
The more that is there,
the more there is to undo.

23:14.467 --> 23:17.181
We can get into
all these specifics later.

23:17.181 --> 23:19.895
So a couple of months,
you said?

23:19.895 --> 23:21.524
Right?

23:21.524 --> 23:24.530
Any particular reason for that,

23:24.530 --> 23:26.659
would you say,
off the top of your head?

23:26.659 --> 23:29.749
A death in the family?
Trouble between Mom and Dad?

23:29.749 --> 23:31.794
‐ Well, actually, both.

23:31.794 --> 23:34.800
Hawk's mother and I
have been separated

23:34.800 --> 23:38.390
for a few months now, and...
‐ Well...

23:38.390 --> 23:40.896
lookee there.

23:40.896 --> 23:43.025
Now, you listen to me, Dad.

23:43.025 --> 23:45.572
This is not your fault, okay?

23:45.572 --> 23:50.331
There may be reasons,
but there are no excuses.

23:50.331 --> 23:52.628
Right, Hawk?

23:52.628 --> 23:55.049
‐ Of course.
‐ Right.

23:55.049 --> 23:58.807
‐ Hey... Clayton, um...
do you think

23:58.807 --> 24:02.898
that you and I could talk
privately for a moment?

24:04.944 --> 24:07.574
‐ Of course.
Of course.

24:07.574 --> 24:09.662
Hawk, you mind giving us
a second, buddy?

24:09.662 --> 24:11.833
There's a chair right outside
in the hallway.

24:11.833 --> 24:13.753
‐ Certainly.
Thank you.

24:13.753 --> 24:15.172
‐ Thanks, kid.

24:27.781 --> 24:30.579
‐ No sweets for you, young man.

24:30.579 --> 24:32.916
Not yet.

25:02.225 --> 25:05.314
This is set, so...
ah, without any further ado.

25:05.314 --> 25:09.239
Just really try to be

25:09.239 --> 25:12.078
with the guy or gal sitting
across from you.

25:12.078 --> 25:13.748
Eye contact, everyone.

25:13.748 --> 25:15.251
- Remember that?
- Yeah.

25:15.251 --> 25:17.923
And not to get all
fortune cookie on you,

25:17.923 --> 25:19.969
but being present
is really important.

25:19.969 --> 25:21.096
‐ It's true.

25:21.096 --> 25:22.515
It's easier not to think about

25:22.515 --> 25:24.060
the "what else"
or "who else"

25:24.060 --> 25:25.689
when you're just right there,

25:25.689 --> 25:28.110
with the person
in front of you.

25:28.110 --> 25:32.786
- But most importantly...
- ‐

25:32.786 --> 25:36.293
- ‐ Have fun.
- ‐ That's right.

25:36.293 --> 25:40.509
Now, as far as homework goes,
that isn't half bad, right?

25:55.497 --> 25:57.251
‐ I'm Caleb...

26:15.162 --> 26:17.584
‐ Hey.

26:17.584 --> 26:20.464
I'm getting you out of here.
Come on.

26:20.464 --> 26:22.844
‐ No, look, I‐I can't.
I can't leave.

26:22.844 --> 26:25.057
You have to stop this, Hawk.
Really, you have to‐‐

26:25.057 --> 26:26.476
‐ Just come on. Let's go.

26:26.476 --> 26:27.604
‐ No, seriously,
stop this, Hawk.

26:27.604 --> 26:29.273
‐ Come on.
‐ Don't, Hawk.

26:31.361 --> 26:33.365
‐ Don't do this.
‐ What is wrong with‐‐

26:33.365 --> 26:36.664
‐ Hawk.

26:36.664 --> 26:38.668
You're leaving!
I'm staying!

26:40.337 --> 26:42.508
- Who are you?
- Caleb?

26:43.720 --> 26:45.180
- It's okay.
- Hey.

26:45.180 --> 26:46.559
He's leaving.

26:50.315 --> 26:52.111
‐ Let's get out of here.

26:55.702 --> 26:57.622
‐ Hey.

27:02.465 --> 27:05.137
‐ Why are you doing this?

27:05.137 --> 27:09.938
‐ To tune ourselves in
to the frequency of the Lord.

27:09.938 --> 27:13.320
To hear His message
loud and clear.

27:19.165 --> 27:22.171
- ‐ You're deluded.
- Am I?

27:22.171 --> 27:24.927
Or are you?

27:26.722 --> 27:29.728
Okay, thank you.

27:29.728 --> 27:33.945
Uh, I see our wonderful staff
waiting for me to wrap it up,

27:33.945 --> 27:37.117
and, uh, well, honestly,
I can't compete with sand dabs.

27:37.117 --> 27:39.581
So...

27:39.581 --> 27:41.710
I'll say this in conclusion.

27:41.710 --> 27:44.298
The fight that the Americans
for Reproductive Freedom

27:44.298 --> 27:46.177
is waging
against the dark forces

27:46.177 --> 27:47.889
in our society‐‐

27:47.889 --> 27:49.768
forces that are hell‐bent
on dictating

27:49.768 --> 27:52.732
what women can and cannot do
with their own bodies‐‐

27:52.732 --> 27:56.030
is one of the most important
and righteous fights

27:56.030 --> 27:58.243
taking place
in our nation today.

27:58.243 --> 28:00.665
It's a privilege to have
the AFRF's support.

28:00.665 --> 28:03.169
And as both a congressman
and a citizen,

28:03.169 --> 28:05.424
it's an honor
to offer them mine.

28:05.424 --> 28:08.764
Thank you.

28:08.764 --> 28:10.392
Thank you very much.

28:10.392 --> 28:13.899
And without further ado,
the sand dabs.

28:13.899 --> 28:15.360
Thank you all.
Good night.

28:17.699 --> 28:19.620
‐ Wonderful remarks,
Congressman.

28:19.620 --> 28:21.289
Thank you for being here.

28:21.289 --> 28:24.546
‐ Oh, it's my pleasure.

28:24.546 --> 28:25.798
Truly.

28:25.798 --> 28:27.719
‐ Your associate
mentioned to us

28:27.719 --> 28:29.931
that you
haven't written down

28:29.931 --> 28:32.436
any of your speeches
since the eighth grade.

28:32.436 --> 28:34.816
Is that true?

28:36.862 --> 28:38.824
‐ It's true.
Phillips Middle School.

28:38.824 --> 28:42.081
I was running
for student body president.

28:42.081 --> 28:43.834
‐ Why, though?

28:43.834 --> 28:46.339
‐ Well, I lost the campaign,
and I blamed my speech.

28:46.339 --> 28:48.426
‐ And he has not lost
a campaign since.

28:48.426 --> 28:49.971
‐ Ah.
‐ Also true.

28:49.971 --> 28:51.809
I just didn't like the feeling.

28:51.809 --> 28:53.436
But enough about me.

28:54.815 --> 28:56.317
Oh, thank you.

28:56.317 --> 28:58.405
Thank you so much.

29:04.918 --> 29:08.007
‐ You will thank me later.
You know you will.

29:08.007 --> 29:10.805
‐ That is so arrogant.
You know that, right?

29:10.805 --> 29:13.143
‐ You know that you're shouting
at a woman in a hotel hallway?

29:13.143 --> 29:14.353
Want to think it through?

29:14.353 --> 29:15.439
Jesus.

29:15.439 --> 29:16.525
Shit.

29:16.525 --> 29:19.029
‐ That... right there.

29:19.029 --> 29:21.827
You talk to me
like I'm such a piece of shit,

29:21.827 --> 29:24.583
and you're just, what,
some fully actualized...

29:25.960 --> 29:28.465
Whatever.

29:28.465 --> 29:30.135
What are you doing?

29:30.135 --> 29:32.014
‐ What the fuck
is wrong with you?

29:32.014 --> 29:33.601
Seriously?

29:33.601 --> 29:35.479
A waitress
from a women's rights dinner,

29:35.479 --> 29:36.940
and I don't know shit?

29:38.861 --> 29:40.531
‐ What's she saying?

29:40.531 --> 29:43.077
‐ That doesn't matter.

29:43.077 --> 29:45.290
‐ What are you doing?
‐ "So nice to meet you.

29:45.290 --> 29:47.294
"Thanks for supporting
a woman's right to choose.

29:47.294 --> 29:49.173
Let's get the vote out
in November."

29:49.173 --> 29:50.968
I'm gonna hold on
to this, okay?

29:50.968 --> 29:53.724
Till tomorrow, because you
literally cannot be trusted.

29:56.939 --> 29:59.235
‐

29:59.235 --> 30:00.403
Fine.

30:00.403 --> 30:01.615
Fuck it.

30:03.284 --> 30:05.038
I'm ordering
room service, though,

30:05.038 --> 30:07.501
and I'm gonna drink some more,
so get ready for that.

30:07.501 --> 30:08.963
‐ Fine.
You're not leaving this room.

30:08.963 --> 30:10.215
‐ I'm ordering room service.

30:10.215 --> 30:11.927
I know I'm not leaving
the room.

30:11.927 --> 30:13.639
‐ And I'm not leaving either.
‐ Fucking fantastic.

30:13.639 --> 30:17.145
Hi. Uh, can I get the, uh‐‐
the petite filet, please?

30:17.145 --> 30:20.360
And... something red, please.

30:20.360 --> 30:22.949
‐ And order me
some fucking fries.

30:22.949 --> 30:25.287
‐ And some fries, please.

30:25.287 --> 30:27.584
Thank you.
Yes, room 820.

30:34.723 --> 30:37.729
‐

30:39.356 --> 30:42.112
What's going on, Sarah?

30:42.112 --> 30:44.366
‐ Exactly.

30:44.366 --> 30:47.164
What is going on, Cal?

30:47.164 --> 30:49.586
All I want to do is‐‐
is talk to Vera,

30:49.586 --> 30:52.717
and yet, here I am.

30:52.717 --> 30:54.679
Why won't anybody
let me speak to her?

30:54.679 --> 30:56.432
‐ It's between
the two of them, Sarah.

30:56.432 --> 30:58.102
It's personal.
They're figuring it out.

30:58.102 --> 30:59.981
‐ Well, good for fucking them.

30:59.981 --> 31:01.526
Do you think that this is about

31:01.526 --> 31:03.989
"don't mess with my man"
bullshit?

31:03.989 --> 31:05.367
‐ I don't‐‐I have no idea
what this is about.

31:05.367 --> 31:08.039
‐ Clearly you don't.

31:08.039 --> 31:10.586
This is about Lilith...

31:10.586 --> 31:12.757
Vera's mom...

31:12.757 --> 31:14.928
who's missing.

31:17.182 --> 31:20.355
‐ You left Meyerism... yeah?

31:20.355 --> 31:23.027
Why is this
so important to you?

31:23.027 --> 31:24.948
‐ I‐‐

31:24.948 --> 31:27.662
I guess it started
with The Hypoxian Cleanse.

31:27.662 --> 31:29.791
And The Hypoxian Cleanse
started with Lilith.

31:29.791 --> 31:31.545
It's hers.

31:31.545 --> 31:34.592
She was trying to help
cure Steve of his pedophilia.

31:36.387 --> 31:38.266
Do you know
that I used to think

31:38.266 --> 31:42.984
that I had every imaginable
angle of Meyerism figured out?

31:45.823 --> 31:47.200
And I'm devastated.

31:47.200 --> 31:48.787
And I guess that's why
I'm trying

31:48.787 --> 31:50.541
to latch on
to something that's real‐‐

31:50.541 --> 31:53.337
something that is actual‐‐
and hold on for dear life,

31:53.337 --> 31:55.843
because...

32:13.127 --> 32:15.048
‐ I've been seeing
a therapist.

32:19.473 --> 32:22.354
‐ That's good.
Who?

32:22.354 --> 32:25.528
‐

32:25.528 --> 32:28.575
‐ Out there?

32:28.575 --> 32:32.249
I am really glad
to hear you say that.

32:32.249 --> 32:33.710
Why now?

32:33.710 --> 32:35.589
‐

32:35.589 --> 32:38.469
In a way, I feel exactly
the same way as you.

32:38.469 --> 32:41.016
But instead
of losing my perspective

32:41.016 --> 32:43.939
because of contradictions
and half‐truths,

32:43.939 --> 32:45.860
I feel, uh...

32:52.455 --> 32:54.209
Blinded by...

32:56.590 --> 32:58.467
Emptiness.

33:00.221 --> 33:01.892
Nothingness.

33:04.856 --> 33:08.196
I'm realizing that I'm...
I'm disappearing

33:08.196 --> 33:10.701
from my own life's story.

33:12.788 --> 33:14.918
The pages are blank.
‐ In what ways?

33:14.918 --> 33:16.963
Once I started to realize

33:16.963 --> 33:20.554
how much of my own life
I couldn't remember...

33:20.554 --> 33:21.890
um...

33:25.564 --> 33:28.152
How much had been,
you know, blocked out...

33:28.152 --> 33:29.488
um...

33:33.789 --> 33:36.168
The foundation
started to crumble.

33:42.138 --> 33:45.729
‐ And this therapist,
is, uh...

33:45.729 --> 33:47.566
he or she helping you?

33:47.566 --> 33:50.656
‐ No, but mostly because I lie
to her all the time, so...

33:50.656 --> 33:52.868
‐

33:53.996 --> 33:56.166
Oh, yes, that would hamstring

33:56.166 --> 33:58.129
any potential for whatever
they call it‐‐a breakthrough.

33:58.129 --> 34:00.759
‐ Yeah, apparently.

34:04.182 --> 34:07.565
Steve didn't develop
The HC himself?

34:07.565 --> 34:09.025
‐ Mm‐mm.

34:09.025 --> 34:11.071
I found this film at my mom's

34:11.071 --> 34:12.742
of Steve in the cave, and...

34:14.871 --> 34:19.338
Lilith was instructing him
to Cleanse.

34:19.338 --> 34:22.260
And there were some notebooks
that were still there.

34:22.260 --> 34:24.348
‐ All right, sorry,
y‐you said...

34:24.348 --> 34:26.310
‐ The notebooks?
There were some still‐‐

34:26.310 --> 34:28.356
‐ Yeah. In a cave?

34:28.356 --> 34:30.610
‐ Yeah. Here...

34:30.610 --> 34:33.909
out by the bend near the river.

34:33.909 --> 34:36.706
‐ Is it a cave
with painted flowers?

34:38.167 --> 34:39.670
‐ Yeah.

35:12.778 --> 35:14.364
I'm real.

35:14.364 --> 35:17.621
Not in a hallucination.

35:17.621 --> 35:19.959
- Where's your mother?
- ‐

35:19.959 --> 35:22.213
Um...

35:25.721 --> 35:28.225
Well, I haven't...

35:28.225 --> 35:30.271
I haven't spoken
to her in weeks.

35:30.271 --> 35:32.735
‐ You think you're gonna
get something out of this?

35:32.735 --> 35:35.532
AL? Playing Meyerist?

35:35.532 --> 35:37.160
You won't.

35:37.160 --> 35:39.039
The Light won't illuminate
anything within you

35:39.039 --> 35:41.084
because there isn't
anything within you.

35:41.084 --> 35:44.801
You are hollow,
empty, and a liar.

35:44.801 --> 35:47.472
‐ Sarah, she...

35:47.472 --> 35:50.813
she isn't who you think she is.

35:50.813 --> 35:52.858
I've lied to a lot of people.

35:52.858 --> 35:56.240
I've lied to you,
and I'm sorry.

35:56.240 --> 35:58.410
I've lied to Eddie.
‐ I don't care.

35:58.410 --> 36:02.878
‐ Lilith...
she's dangerous.

36:02.878 --> 36:04.841
She's not just deceitful.

36:10.518 --> 36:12.857
Do you... do you know
what she believes?

36:12.857 --> 36:13.859
‐ I do.
‐ No, you don't.

36:13.859 --> 36:15.361
‐ Just because it isn't

36:15.361 --> 36:17.490
all warm and fuzzy
doesn't make it wrong.

36:17.490 --> 36:20.581
‐ She believes
that Eddie will die...

36:20.581 --> 36:23.002
for her prophecy
to be fulfilled.

36:25.549 --> 36:27.051
‐ What?

36:27.051 --> 36:30.099
‐ Eddie has to die.

36:30.099 --> 36:32.478
That's what she believes.

36:34.901 --> 36:36.486
‐ Why?

36:37.698 --> 36:40.913
‐ Well, he has
to bring Meyerism

36:40.913 --> 36:42.833
as high as it can go,

36:42.833 --> 36:45.463
and that's what
I was helping to do

36:45.463 --> 36:49.137
until I just couldn't anymore.

36:49.137 --> 36:50.473
The faith has to spread

36:50.473 --> 36:52.226
to as many people
as possible and...

36:56.443 --> 37:00.117
Well, The Movement will crumble
without Eddie, and...

37:00.117 --> 37:03.792
the world will crumble
without The Movement.

37:05.336 --> 37:08.843
I don't know why.
I don't understand.

37:08.843 --> 37:11.181
That's what she told me.
‐ Do you believe that?

37:11.181 --> 37:13.352
‐ I've decided not to.

37:13.352 --> 37:15.649
Yeah, but Lilith,
she will go to her grave

37:15.649 --> 37:18.530
convinced that Eddie
will go to his...

37:18.530 --> 37:20.324
and usher in the end of days.

37:20.324 --> 37:21.619
‐ Where is she?

37:30.011 --> 37:33.267
‐ Need anything else?
Coffee, pie, a milkshake?

37:33.267 --> 37:34.979
‐ No milkshake.

37:34.979 --> 37:37.400
‐ Just the check
would be great, thank you.

37:37.400 --> 37:39.572
‐
Such an asshole.

37:39.572 --> 37:41.324
I mean, I try to get him
out of that freak show,

37:41.324 --> 37:42.745
and he hits me?

37:42.745 --> 37:45.959
I mean, fuck him.
‐ Hey, stop it, okay?

37:45.959 --> 37:48.965
‐

37:48.965 --> 37:51.679
Yeah, you're right.

37:51.679 --> 37:54.350
I'm the asshole.

37:54.350 --> 37:56.021
I deserved to get
punched in the face.

37:56.021 --> 37:57.733
It's...
‐ No.

37:57.733 --> 38:01.824
This has nothing to do
with you and Caleb.

38:01.824 --> 38:04.037
I know you don't want
to hear that,

38:04.037 --> 38:06.291
but it's true.
‐

38:06.291 --> 38:08.838
‐ Okay?
This is all about Caleb

38:08.838 --> 38:10.508
and his father.

38:10.508 --> 38:12.888
‐ Yeah, but his dad's wrong.
Anyone can see that.

38:12.888 --> 38:17.523
‐ Look, Caleb wants his dad
to be so good so badly.

38:17.523 --> 38:19.693
And he wants to trust him,

38:19.693 --> 38:22.908
follow him,
believe in what he says.

38:22.908 --> 38:24.995
We all want that
to a certain extent.

38:27.543 --> 38:31.759
‐ I am... I am so sorry
I was rude to you.

38:31.759 --> 38:34.389
‐ It's all right, sweetheart.
I hate milkshakes, too.

38:46.329 --> 38:49.043
‐ Look, it takes
a lot of courage to admit

38:49.043 --> 38:53.845
that our fathers
have led us astray.

38:53.845 --> 38:58.061
For any of this to make sense,
for it...

38:58.061 --> 39:01.694
not all to feel so aimless...

39:04.073 --> 39:07.956
We want to trust
our parents have steered us

39:07.956 --> 39:10.336
in the right direction.

39:10.336 --> 39:15.597
So sometimes we go
to some pretty insane lengths,

39:15.597 --> 39:18.728
clearly, to make that so.

39:52.713 --> 39:54.507
It's been too long.

40:06.949 --> 40:08.745
‐ It's been hell

40:08.745 --> 40:12.418
since you first...
brought me here.

40:12.418 --> 40:14.505
I need to...

40:14.505 --> 40:18.180
be cleansed
of your entire...

40:20.894 --> 40:23.190
Of your entirety.

40:23.190 --> 40:25.904
‐ You're too hard on yourself.

40:45.735 --> 40:49.576
You're what stands
between me and my past.

40:59.387 --> 41:03.270
I need to cleanse
myself of you.

41:09.157 --> 41:13.165
‐
CAL: I shouldn't feel guilty...

41:13.165 --> 41:14.292
but I do.

41:15.670 --> 41:18.425
I shouldn't feel pride...

41:18.425 --> 41:21.974
- but I do.
- ‐

41:21.974 --> 41:26.191
I shouldn't feel shame,
but I do.

41:26.191 --> 41:28.028
‐

41:28.028 --> 41:32.161
‐

41:32.161 --> 41:34.207
I shouldn't feel love...

41:34.207 --> 41:36.044
‐

41:36.044 --> 41:37.631
But I do.

41:37.631 --> 41:41.680
‐
‐

41:43.684 --> 41:46.314
‐

42:12.951 --> 42:14.830
‐ Buck?

42:17.251 --> 42:18.629
Buck?

42:39.462 --> 42:42.259
‐ I often wish
I was a kid again.

42:42.259 --> 42:45.098
‐ I think we all do‐‐
just with better childhoods

42:45.098 --> 42:47.854
than the ones we actually had.

42:47.854 --> 42:49.231
‐ Yeah.

42:51.945 --> 42:55.077
Someday you'll have to tell me
about yours.

42:59.210 --> 43:02.592
Hey, I...

43:02.592 --> 43:04.763
I'm sorry about last night.

43:04.763 --> 43:06.432
‐ I'm sure you say that
to all the girls...

43:06.432 --> 43:08.144
and their lawyers.

43:08.144 --> 43:10.608
No, we, uh... we had fun.

43:13.531 --> 43:15.117
‐ Hey, let's go get
some breakfast.

43:15.117 --> 43:16.662
You can pay me back
for the fries.

43:16.662 --> 43:17.997
‐ I will pay you back,

43:17.997 --> 43:19.710
but I think
we should stay here.

43:19.710 --> 43:22.716
Morning‐after pancakes
is not a good look, PR‐wise.

43:22.716 --> 43:25.095
‐ Ah, you're right.
Okay.

43:25.095 --> 43:27.600
‐ Well... a room service life.

43:27.600 --> 43:30.313
‐ Well, it's what
you signed up for.

43:36.409 --> 43:38.998
‐ Hey.

43:38.998 --> 43:42.337
How'd it go?

43:42.337 --> 43:45.385
‐
‐ Did Caleb come back with you?

43:45.385 --> 43:49.477
‐ No, he, uh... he stayed.

43:49.477 --> 43:52.692
‐ Oh, that's, um‐‐
that's awful.

43:54.529 --> 43:57.535
Hey, um...
Eddie, I, um...

43:58.788 --> 44:02.085
I wanted to tell you something.

44:02.085 --> 44:05.927
My mother...
I had her put away in this‐‐

44:05.927 --> 44:08.348
‐ No, don't. Look...

44:08.348 --> 44:10.519
you don't have to tell me.

44:10.519 --> 44:13.274
Okay?
Not now.

44:13.274 --> 44:16.364
You can tell me later.

44:16.364 --> 44:20.665
Look, it's just been
a very... long night,

44:20.665 --> 44:24.965
and I don't want to
be mad at you anymore.

44:26.342 --> 44:31.687
I am extremely mad
at Steve, and...

44:31.687 --> 44:34.400
I don't know what
to do with that.

44:34.400 --> 44:36.905
‐ I'm sorry.

44:36.905 --> 44:39.076
It makes me sad.

44:39.076 --> 44:40.746
‐ Yeah, me too.

44:40.746 --> 44:43.293
‐ All of it.

44:48.596 --> 44:51.183
‐ Mm.
‐ Let's just...

44:52.604 --> 44:54.649
Be us, okay?

44:54.649 --> 44:56.820
Just for a little while.

44:56.820 --> 44:59.199
Just here...

44:59.199 --> 45:01.454
now, us...

45:01.454 --> 45:03.207
‐ Mm.
‐ And not them.

45:24.751 --> 45:28.091
‐ Sarah.

45:28.091 --> 45:30.846
I just knew you would find me.

45:32.182 --> 45:35.815
I'm so indebted to you.

45:35.815 --> 45:39.238
‐ You never told me
that Vera was your daughter...

45:39.238 --> 45:40.992
or that Steve was her father.

45:40.992 --> 45:42.369
‐ I know.

45:42.369 --> 45:44.415
And that was terribly
wrong of me.

45:44.415 --> 45:45.668
‐ Wrong?

45:45.668 --> 45:48.131
‐ I wanted you
to know the work,

45:48.131 --> 45:50.553
not what was happening
in my personal life.

45:50.553 --> 45:53.224
‐ I wanted to believe
that The Light spoke to you.

45:55.270 --> 45:58.359
‐ It did.

45:58.359 --> 46:02.660
And I think you know that.

46:02.660 --> 46:05.373
‐ I don't know anything.

46:05.373 --> 46:07.085
‐ Then you wouldn't be here.

46:07.085 --> 46:08.881
You wouldn't have
tracked me down.

46:08.881 --> 46:12.054
I think you need
to set things right.

46:12.054 --> 46:14.768
‐ I do need
to set things right.

46:14.768 --> 46:16.730
‐ Vera put me in here,

46:16.730 --> 46:19.485
and she's the only one
who can get me out.

46:19.485 --> 46:22.115
‐ I think you're
right where you need to be.

46:22.115 --> 46:24.411
‐ No, you need...

46:24.411 --> 46:26.082
You have to do
something about this.

46:26.082 --> 46:27.585
If not,
you're no better than them.

46:27.585 --> 46:29.547
You're no better than Steve.

46:29.547 --> 46:31.133
Sarah!

46:34.933 --> 46:37.270
Get me out of here!

47:20.148 --> 47:23.404
‐ Hey.
‐ Ah, he returns.

47:23.404 --> 47:26.160
Welcome back. Um...

47:26.160 --> 47:28.414
Not much to report,

47:28.414 --> 47:30.628
but, uh, I can give you
a debrief

47:30.628 --> 47:32.882
on what you've missed
if you'd like.

47:35.220 --> 47:38.059
‐ Something happen, Cal?

47:38.059 --> 47:40.188
‐ Happen...

47:40.188 --> 47:41.942
‐ To you...

47:43.402 --> 47:44.948
With Steve.

47:49.666 --> 47:52.212
‐ How‐‐um...

47:52.212 --> 47:54.383
‐ You don't have to tell me.

47:59.978 --> 48:02.107
‐ No, I, um...

48:12.920 --> 48:15.049
Pray with me?

48:20.018 --> 48:22.063
‐ You still want
to be a Meyerist?

48:25.403 --> 48:27.198
‐ I shouldn't.

48:30.204 --> 48:32.543
But I do.
