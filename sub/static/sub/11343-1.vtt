'In the criminal justice system,

00:03.337 --> 00:06.773
'sexually based offences
are considered especially heinous.

'In New York City, the detectives
who investigate these vicious felonies

00:26.937 --> 00:28.928
- Sex Crimes?
- Olivia Benson.

00:28.977 --> 00:30.205
Elliot Stabler.

00:30.257 --> 00:35.570
Frank Bremmer, 2-7. A white male,
mid-30s, multiple stab wounds.

00:35.617 --> 00:38.370
$40 left in the cigar box.

00:40.297 --> 00:42.686
Hack licence made out to Victor Spicer.

00:42.737 --> 00:45.410
$12 in a wallet was in his pants. No ID.

00:48.217 --> 00:52.574
OK, so it's not a robbery,
but stabbings aren't necessarily sexual.

00:53.497 --> 00:57.456
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
Any specific reason you called us?

00:57.497 --> 01:00.694
Whoever did this sliced off his cigar
and took it with him.

01:00.737 --> 01:03.092
Is that specific enough?

01:05.537 --> 01:07.528
Works for me.

01:56.497 --> 01:58.328
Sorry I'm late.

01:58.377 --> 02:02.973
I talked to Van Buren at the 2-7.
She wants all our paperwork on this.

02:03.017 --> 02:05.133
- Where are we?
- Autopsy this afternoon.

02:05.177 --> 02:07.133
- Who's cutting?
- Rodgers.

02:07.177 --> 02:09.133
Not much doubt on the COD.

02:09.176 --> 02:13.329
Are your conclusional pole-vaults
personality or gender driven?

02:13.377 --> 02:15.937
I dunno.
What about deductively logical?

02:15.977 --> 02:19.333
Really? I had what looked like
a stabbing once.

02:19.377 --> 02:23.336
Turned out some guy was getting divorced,
drank drain cleaner.

02:23.377 --> 02:27.928
When his soon-to-be-unmarried widow
discovered him dead, no alimony,

02:27.977 --> 02:31.094
she stabbed him 15 times out of pique.

02:31.137 --> 02:33.014
- Captain?
- What?

02:33.057 --> 02:36.129
Desk sergeant just got a call
for a Sex Crimes detective

02:36.177 --> 02:37.849
at the 96th Street IRT.

02:37.897 --> 02:40.536
- Why?
- Some guy molesting a dead body.

02:40.577 --> 02:42.533
Oh, that is just terrific.

02:42.577 --> 02:44.454
- Who's up?
- Me and Munch.

02:44.497 --> 02:48.854
I think a dead molestee can be
handled by one detective. Cassidy.

02:48.897 --> 02:53.413
Munch, give Stabler and Benson
the benefit of your experience.

02:53.457 --> 02:57.132
If the body's dead,
is that considered a sex crime?

02:57.177 --> 03:01.534
Just go.
Investigate, interrogate, write up a DD5.

03:01.577 --> 03:05.411
You follow up with the cab company
for a home address on the vic.

03:05.457 --> 03:08.130
- I'll do the hack bureau.
- What about your partner?

03:08.177 --> 03:11.726
I'd love to but my presence
is required in court.

03:11.777 --> 03:14.291
I read about it in the news. City councilman?

03:14.337 --> 03:15.975
Wienie wagger.

03:18.977 --> 03:21.286
Detective Stabler.

03:21.337 --> 03:26.695
You previously testified that when you first
approached the defendant in the park,

03:26.737 --> 03:29.251
he was feeding the pigeons, is that correct?

03:29.297 --> 03:31.094
That's correct.

03:31.137 --> 03:34.334
The zipper
on Mr Kloster's pants was closed?

03:34.377 --> 03:37.494
- At that time, yes.
- So to your knowledge,

03:37.537 --> 03:41.007
Mr Kloster's pants
have never been unzipped in public?

03:41.057 --> 03:44.686
- You got me. He didn't flash me.
- Why did you arrest him?

03:44.737 --> 03:49.253
Two women told me the defendant
had been exposing himself.

03:49.297 --> 03:54.690
So you arrested my client based
on their uncorroborated accusations?

03:54.737 --> 03:57.092
Yes. I've known both women for five years.

03:57.137 --> 03:59.093
So you know them well?

03:59.137 --> 04:01.048
Yes.

04:02.097 --> 04:03.894
Intimately?

04:03.937 --> 04:06.212
Don't be ridiculous. We're neighbours.

04:06.257 --> 04:10.728
You work in the Special Victims Unit
of the NYPD. Is that correct?

04:10.777 --> 04:12.415
Yes, it is.

04:12.457 --> 04:16.814
And this unit is referred to
in the police as the Sex Crimes Unit?

04:16.857 --> 04:19.052
That's correct, yes.

04:19.937 --> 04:22.087
Are you obsessed with sex, Detective?

04:22.137 --> 04:24.856
- Objection.
- Sustained.

04:24.897 --> 04:27.286
This is an all-volunteer unit, correct?

04:27.337 --> 04:31.296
- Yes, it is.
- Tell the court why you volunteered.

04:31.337 --> 04:33.726
I requested the assignment

04:33.777 --> 04:37.326
because sexually based crimes
are a major law enforcement problem.

04:37.377 --> 04:42.531
So, you see yourself
as the Ken Starr of the NYPD?

04:42.577 --> 04:48.095
Hardly. Sex should be one of
the best parts of life, not the worst.

04:48.137 --> 04:50.697
I see myself as the father of four children,

04:50.737 --> 04:55.333
none of whom I'd like exposed
to Mr Kloster's... shortcomings.

04:55.857 --> 04:57.290
Shortcomings?

04:59.337 --> 05:00.975
Shortcomings?

05:08.697 --> 05:10.927
Shortcomings my ass, you putz head!

05:10.977 --> 05:13.775
Yeah! Look at that! Shortcomings, huh?

05:13.817 --> 05:15.853
Take a look! Look at it!

05:20.657 --> 05:22.613
Hey, how'd it go?

05:22.657 --> 05:24.170
He's in Bellevue.

05:25.217 --> 05:27.526
The jury came back that fast?

05:27.577 --> 05:31.695
He waved his flag at them before
they had a chance. Nobody saluted.

05:32.377 --> 05:36.495
OK. Unfortunately, our homicide
isn't gonna close as fast.

05:36.537 --> 05:38.255
We have a problem.

05:38.297 --> 05:41.095
- OK, shoot.
- I went to the hack bureau.

05:41.137 --> 05:45.972
Victor Spicer's licence was suspended
when he got 11 months for assault.

05:46.017 --> 05:47.769
And?

05:47.817 --> 05:49.808
He's still in Rikers.

05:50.777 --> 05:53.849
Don't trust the computers.
They get backed up on releases.

05:53.897 --> 05:57.173
So I talked to the watch captain.
Spicer's still there.

05:57.217 --> 06:01.290
- Why is this ours?
- Doer sliced off the vic's unit.

06:03.137 --> 06:06.891
I got Spicer's sheet.
Prostitution, soliciting, petty theft.

06:06.937 --> 06:10.486
He also managed to get two
of his clients arrested, both married.

06:10.537 --> 06:14.450
So he's scum. But he's not dead scum.
So who's the stiff?

06:14.497 --> 06:17.728
According to his hack licence
he's Victor Spicer.

06:17.777 --> 06:20.450
There's no other ID
on the body or in the cab.

06:23.897 --> 06:26.206
Police work.

06:31.857 --> 06:34.132
Seam's uneven.

06:41.217 --> 06:43.811
I would take a ride over to Rikers

06:43.857 --> 06:47.452
and see if Mr Spicer
thinks he has any enemies.

06:48.697 --> 06:50.688
OK.

06:51.697 --> 06:53.688
You're welcome.

06:57.057 --> 06:59.412
- Home, maybe?
- Get in there.

06:59.457 --> 07:01.209
Oooh...

07:01.257 --> 07:03.213
Cops.

07:03.257 --> 07:05.248
Why?

07:07.177 --> 07:10.806
You're looking awfully good there
for a dead man, Victor.

07:10.857 --> 07:12.006
Meaning?

07:12.057 --> 07:15.413
Somebody killed you in your cab last night.

07:15.457 --> 07:19.848
Before or after I went... dancing?

07:19.897 --> 07:21.853
Question.

07:21.897 --> 07:24.775
Who'd want to cut your penis off?

07:24.817 --> 07:27.206
Take a number.

07:27.257 --> 07:31.933
The victim was using your licence.
Had a wife, little kid.

07:31.977 --> 07:33.968
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

07:34.017 --> 07:36.247
- So?
- How about a name?

07:36.297 --> 07:38.049
We'll have you out for the weekend.

07:41.057 --> 07:43.412
Yeah, I sold the licence to a guy,

07:43.457 --> 07:46.210
right before I went in, a hundred bucks.

07:46.257 --> 07:48.452
I don't know his name.

07:48.497 --> 07:52.934
You'll have to do better than that
if you want us to help you out.

07:52.977 --> 07:54.535
Yeah, yeah.

07:54.577 --> 07:56.568
It was on Broadway.

07:56.617 --> 07:59.051
Right near the 125th Street El.

07:59.097 --> 08:02.248
That's right. The guy had the kid with him.

08:02.297 --> 08:04.857
I don't know, four, maybe five.

08:04.897 --> 08:08.014
So, you walk up to a guy
on Broadway, broad daylight.

08:08.057 --> 08:11.493
He gives you a hundred bucks,
you give him your hack licence?

08:11.537 --> 08:14.973
A foreign gentleman
at a coffee shop I frequent set it up.

08:15.017 --> 08:16.245
Names.

08:16.297 --> 08:18.652
43rd and 11th.

08:18.697 --> 08:22.770
Cabbies' place. I don't know his name.

08:26.497 --> 08:28.453
Oh, yeah, the guy...

08:28.497 --> 08:31.057
The guy on Broadway had groceries.

08:31.097 --> 08:33.565
He must've lived around there.

08:36.857 --> 08:40.452
Hey. You doing anything Saturday night?

08:43.857 --> 08:45.893
Oh, I'd hurt you.

08:46.857 --> 08:51.806
Sergeants are distributing
the vic pic in the 2-3 and the 2-7.

08:51.857 --> 08:54.849
They'll hit every apartment within ten blocks.

08:55.857 --> 08:58.417
This guy's wife must be going nuts.

08:58.457 --> 09:02.211
Missing Persons won't take
the report for two days.

09:02.257 --> 09:05.613
Who was supposed to get sliced,
Spicer or the mystery man?

09:05.657 --> 09:08.171
Spicer was the one who said,
'Take a number.'

09:08.217 --> 09:10.173
BLT with hash. Burn it.

09:10.217 --> 09:13.448
- Can we talk to you a minute?
- I'm kind of busy here.

09:13.497 --> 09:15.453
- Hack bureau?
- Police.

09:15.497 --> 09:17.886
- Oh. What's up?
- You ever seen this guy?

09:18.937 --> 09:20.973
Yeah, but he hasn't been in months.

09:21.017 --> 09:23.577
- Do you remember his name?
- Victor.

09:23.617 --> 09:24.936
What about this one?

09:24.977 --> 09:28.413
Yeah, a regular. Comes in
at midnight. He was here last night.

09:28.457 --> 09:31.813
- Got a name for him?
- Now, that's weird. Victor.

09:31.857 --> 09:34.052
Excuse me. Jesus!

09:34.097 --> 09:36.611
I said corny on pump, this is rye.

09:36.657 --> 09:40.286
Do you know what it's like
never hearing English?

09:40.337 --> 09:44.376
- Did you ever talk to Victor Two?
- Almost every night recently.

09:44.417 --> 09:47.807
- Yeah? What about?
- Traffic, weather, his kid. Why?

09:47.857 --> 09:50.325
Somebody killed him last night.

09:51.337 --> 09:53.407
This city sucks!

09:53.457 --> 09:56.096
Can I have my sandwiches, please?

09:56.137 --> 10:00.767
It's easy to become a cab driver.
He was probably here illegally.

10:00.817 --> 10:02.409
No green card, no hack licence.

10:02.457 --> 10:05.176
Wait! Becky told me Victor was killed.

10:05.217 --> 10:08.209
- Which Victor?
- Who would care about him?

10:08.257 --> 10:11.408
- You know his real name?
- Steven.

10:11.457 --> 10:15.006
- And his last name?
- Never asked. I saw him last night.

10:15.057 --> 10:18.686
- What time?
- Around midnight, I guess. Yes.

10:18.737 --> 10:21.809
He came out as I went in,
and two ladies hailed him.

10:22.857 --> 10:25.291
- Could you identify them?
- It was very dark.

10:25.337 --> 10:27.407
- They see you?
- They must have.

10:27.457 --> 10:31.689
We were in the light.
He was crazy about his little boy.

10:31.737 --> 10:35.093
His wife is pregnant. They just found out.

10:39.697 --> 10:43.656
Your dead taxi driver? Cab dispatcher
finally called. Got a call last week

10:43.697 --> 10:47.929
asking if Spicer was one of their
drivers and what time he worked.

10:47.977 --> 10:50.366
- Male or female?
- He wasn't sure.

10:50.417 --> 10:54.535
Said the voice was too high for a guy,
too deep for a woman.

10:54.577 --> 10:58.126
- Aren't these fabulous?
- OK. This poor guy is butchered

10:58.177 --> 11:02.728
and whoever killed him thought
he was that disco queen in Rikers.

11:02.777 --> 11:05.735
OK, let's say the vic had the misfortune

11:05.777 --> 11:10.407
to buy the wrong licence and Spicer's
the target. Who wanted him dead?

11:10.457 --> 11:13.449
- Whoever called the dispatcher.
- Wow.

11:13.497 --> 11:15.772
Nice. Good stuff.

11:15.817 --> 11:17.967
Yeah? What? Mm-hm.

11:18.017 --> 11:21.373
Great. Uniform just got a hit on your vic.

11:21.417 --> 11:23.977
687, West 123rd.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.894
A Steven Panacek.

11:25.937 --> 11:27.893
- Thanks. Thanks a lot.
- Never stops.

11:27.937 --> 11:30.735
They have more varieties than that.

11:34.457 --> 11:38.086
- Apartment 1 B. Nobody's home.
- Thanks. Good job, guys.

11:38.137 --> 11:40.810
Hey, that's the kid in the picture.

11:40.857 --> 11:44.213
- You got the Victim Services cards?
- Yeah.

11:44.257 --> 11:46.213
- Mrs Panacek?
- Yes?

11:46.257 --> 11:50.614
Hi. I'm Detective Stabler,
this is Detective Benson.

11:50.657 --> 11:54.127
- What's happened to Steven?
- Mrs Panacek...

11:54.177 --> 11:58.455
Was he in an accident?
What hospital is he in? Can I...?

12:00.857 --> 12:02.609
Oh, no!

12:02.657 --> 12:04.613
Oh, God, no!

12:04.657 --> 12:06.613
Oh, my God, no!

12:06.657 --> 12:08.648
Oh, God!

12:09.657 --> 12:11.648
Why? Why Steven?

12:18.217 --> 12:21.015
He was here illegally, wasn't he?

12:23.057 --> 12:25.048
Mrs Panacek?

12:26.457 --> 12:29.688
What difference does that make now?

12:31.097 --> 12:33.406
Don't you want us to find who did this?

12:33.457 --> 12:35.448
Yes.

12:36.657 --> 12:38.727
What nationality was he?

12:41.137 --> 12:43.093
He was Czech.

12:43.137 --> 12:46.652
- When were you married?
- Almost five years ago.

12:47.657 --> 12:50.694
Steven never applied for residency.

12:50.737 --> 12:56.255
He talked to an immigration lawyer
and he said they would deport him.

13:01.897 --> 13:07.335
You should, erm, talk to Victim Services.
They can be very helpful.

13:07.377 --> 13:10.528
- Thank you.
- I'm so sorry.

13:10.577 --> 13:12.533
Oh, baby.

13:12.577 --> 13:14.568
How's my baby?

13:18.857 --> 13:21.166
I'm so sorry for your loss.

13:22.497 --> 13:24.089
Thank you.

13:26.217 --> 13:29.653
That's great. Thanks a lot. Yeah, bye.

13:29.697 --> 13:31.289
That was the ME.

13:31.337 --> 13:34.454
- The stab wounds? 37 of them.
- Wow.

13:34.497 --> 13:37.330
- This still reads gay to me.
- You got a fax.

13:37.377 --> 13:41.689
Panacek's prints are clean
so let's do this by the numbers.

13:41.737 --> 13:44.695
He's illegal, send a set to Interpol.

13:44.737 --> 13:48.207
- Forensics report.
- What?

13:49.897 --> 13:53.207
They found part of a fingernail
in the front seat of the cab.

13:53.257 --> 13:55.248
With red nail polish on it.

13:55.297 --> 13:57.936
Dispatcher thought
it was a woman who called.

13:57.977 --> 14:00.207
Kind of undercuts your gay theory.

14:00.257 --> 14:02.771
Could be a he-she.

14:02.817 --> 14:05.570
Didn't two of Spicer's
married johns take a bust?

14:05.617 --> 14:07.494
Yeah, about six months ago.

14:07.537 --> 14:11.815
- Vice targeted the piers.
- Their wives must've been thrilled.

14:11.857 --> 14:14.212
What are you doing?

14:14.257 --> 14:17.215
- Eavesdropping.
- Good, you're up to speed.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.612
Why don't you interrogate a husband?

14:19.657 --> 14:23.650
- Anyone in particular?
- Enjoy yourself.

14:26.297 --> 14:30.813
I already paid my fine. Do you know
the problems that arrest caused me?

14:30.857 --> 14:33.576
You were with a male prostitute.

14:33.617 --> 14:36.290
I have nothing to do with Spicer.

14:36.337 --> 14:38.453
Somebody tried to kill him.

14:38.497 --> 14:41.569
- I wouldn't go near that animal!
- Calm down.

14:41.617 --> 14:45.371
- We want to ask about your wife.
- What is wrong with you?

14:45.417 --> 14:47.806
- Leave my wife out of this!
- Hey!

14:47.857 --> 14:50.371
Do you want to be arrested again?

14:50.417 --> 14:54.376
- No. No!
- Then answer my partner's questions.

14:58.577 --> 15:03.253
- I got a bad rotator cuff.
- Where was your wife last night?

15:03.297 --> 15:05.413
In her wheelchair.

15:06.457 --> 15:08.846
She's a paraplegic.

15:08.897 --> 15:11.775
Why do you think I was in the back of a taxi?

15:11.817 --> 15:16.413
Good question. If it was a female prostitute.

15:16.457 --> 15:20.848
You enjoy this, do you?
Is this how you get your rocks off?

15:20.897 --> 15:23.365
Thanks for your cooperation.

15:27.137 --> 15:30.209
Spicer's a disgusting
little piece of street meat

15:30.257 --> 15:34.933
but he has an extraordinarily gifted
orifice in the middle of his face.

15:34.977 --> 15:37.013
Know anybody who'd want to kill him?

15:37.057 --> 15:41.812
- There's a host of candidates.
- Like your wife, maybe?

15:41.857 --> 15:46.214
I know you find it hard to believe
but I have nothing to hide.

15:46.257 --> 15:50.933
My sexual predilections may not
be known to the readers of Page Six

15:50.977 --> 15:54.049
but they're known
to my friends and my wife.

15:54.097 --> 15:57.009
For the record, where was she last night?

15:57.057 --> 15:59.617
My wife? You're joking.

15:59.657 --> 16:01.375
No, we're not.

16:01.417 --> 16:04.614
My wife's bisexual but she prefers women.

16:04.657 --> 16:08.491
- How lucky for her.
- We have a civilised relationship.

16:08.537 --> 16:11.370
So tell us where she was,
say, 1am this morning?

16:11.417 --> 16:17.094
At a restaurant, Elaine's,
with me and four very good friends.

16:22.697 --> 16:24.096
Thank you.

16:28.337 --> 16:30.328
Her name is Clarissa.

16:31.337 --> 16:34.295
And you should give her a call.

16:36.777 --> 16:40.406
A military plane
drops JFK's coffin into the water,

16:40.457 --> 16:43.210
three years after the assassination.

16:43.257 --> 16:46.249
You don't find that a bit disquieting?

16:47.457 --> 16:49.573
- No.
- No?

16:49.617 --> 16:54.008
Justice Department waits 33 years
before they tell the people,

16:54.057 --> 16:57.606
then they say they did it
because it wasn't evidence.

16:57.657 --> 17:00.091
- Are you sheep? You believe anything?
- Baa.

17:00.137 --> 17:02.412
You guys going to eat all this?

17:02.457 --> 17:06.006
- Suppose we say yes?
- Suppose I'm just being polite?

17:06.057 --> 17:09.492
- That'd be a first.
- John doesn't eat vegetables.

17:09.537 --> 17:14.691
Yeah? The way I heard, that's not the only
thing John never gets to... eat.

17:15.896 --> 17:17.090
Ouch.

17:17.137 --> 17:21.016
Speaking of DOJ,
you guys see the fax from the Feebs?

17:21.057 --> 17:24.128
- Internet paedophilia.
- Innocent Images Squad.

17:24.176 --> 17:27.249
Anything we find should go to Baltimore.

17:27.297 --> 17:31.893
No way! I'm never setting foot
in the city of Baltimore again.

17:31.937 --> 17:35.976
Why? You're rich, did your 20,
got your pension.

17:36.017 --> 17:38.690
I earned that pension with my mind

17:38.737 --> 17:42.286
while surrounded by intellectual insects.

17:42.337 --> 17:44.931
Not to mention that I lost a wife

17:44.977 --> 17:50.210
to someone who was not only another
detective but a member of my squad.

17:50.257 --> 17:52.213
What's that?

17:53.617 --> 17:57.895
Take a look at that.
Fingerprint check on Panacek.

17:57.937 --> 18:00.849
Gives us a whole different kind of motive.

18:00.897 --> 18:04.572
See if any of the victims
are in the New York area.

18:05.697 --> 18:09.087
- Your partner may not like it.
- It's a murder investigation.

18:09.137 --> 18:12.095
Don't let her forget
we don't get to pick the vic.

18:13.697 --> 18:16.928
Are we missing
some key piece of information?

18:16.977 --> 18:19.775
Shut up, John.

18:19.817 --> 18:21.648
Not going to be a problem.

18:21.697 --> 18:25.451
It can't be a problem
if she wants to be in this unit.

18:26.857 --> 18:30.213
There you go.

18:30.257 --> 18:32.725
'You are admirable,

18:32.777 --> 18:38.295
'for you remain firm, even when
troubled by personal relationships.'

18:39.297 --> 18:42.607
Steven Panacek wasn't Steven Panacek.

18:42.657 --> 18:46.411
OK. First he wasn't Spicer,
now he's not Panacek?

18:46.457 --> 18:50.291
- So, who the hell was he?
- Stefan Tanzic.

18:51.097 --> 18:53.088
Am I supposed to recognise the name?

18:53.137 --> 18:56.015
He's a Serb,
under indictment for war crimes.

18:56.057 --> 19:00.255
- What'd he do?
- Commanded an ethnic cleansing unit.

19:02.497 --> 19:05.409
- He was a rapist?
- Indicted, not convicted.

19:05.457 --> 19:07.448
- How many women?
- 67.

19:08.457 --> 19:10.607
How many are still alive?

19:10.657 --> 19:13.455
I got 15. Five in the New York area.

19:20.657 --> 19:24.206
The shape of some of the wounds
was bothering me

19:24.257 --> 19:27.010
so I made additional measurements.

19:27.057 --> 19:30.447
Width of entry
and depth of penetration varied.

19:30.497 --> 19:35.287
- Is that because he was struggling?
- Some of them were made by a blade

19:35.337 --> 19:38.329
with a serrated edge, some were clean.

19:39.377 --> 19:44.053
I hate to complicate it, but you're
looking for more than one killer.

19:57.257 --> 19:59.817
Oh, have you found out something?

19:59.857 --> 20:02.325
- May we come in?
- Yeah, of course.

20:09.417 --> 20:13.092
- Is your son at home?
- No, he's at preschool.

20:13.137 --> 20:16.288
- You lied to me yesterday.
- Excuse me?

20:16.337 --> 20:19.010
Your husband wasn't a Czech.
He was a Serb.

20:19.057 --> 20:21.048
I don't see what that has to do...

20:21.097 --> 20:25.534
- He was indicted as a war criminal.
- That was just politics.

20:25.577 --> 20:29.570
If you want us to catch his killers
we need all the information.

20:29.617 --> 20:31.733
This goes way beyond politics.

20:31.777 --> 20:33.927
I can see you know what he did.

20:33.977 --> 20:36.013
You don't know anything.

20:36.057 --> 20:38.287
Steven was a wonderful man.

20:38.337 --> 20:40.612
The greatest father I've ever seen.

20:40.657 --> 20:44.093
Let me ask you, what was it like
sleeping with somebody

20:44.137 --> 20:47.129
who raped dozens of defenceless,
terrified women?

20:47.177 --> 20:50.567
- My husband is dead!
- And you know why!

20:50.617 --> 20:52.892
Go! Get out of my house!

20:52.937 --> 20:54.928
No!

20:55.857 --> 20:58.291
That's the dumbest move you ever made.

20:58.337 --> 21:00.897
- She wasn't going to be of any help.
- Not now.

21:00.937 --> 21:03.007
Not ever. She knew what he was.

21:03.057 --> 21:06.447
You just verbally harassed
the wife of a murder victim.

21:06.497 --> 21:09.807
She lied. If anything,
she's guilty of obstruction.

21:09.857 --> 21:13.327
- You're on very thin ice right now.
- How's that?

21:13.377 --> 21:16.972
Cragen's worried
about your objectivity on this.

21:17.017 --> 21:20.453
- Let him take me off the case.
- You don't want to do that.

21:20.497 --> 21:22.613
What's that mean?

21:22.657 --> 21:27.014
You take yourself off this case,
you take yourself out of the unit.

21:27.057 --> 21:31.209
We don't get to pick the vic.
His words, not mine.

21:31.257 --> 21:33.691
I'm a good cop, Elliot.

21:33.737 --> 21:36.171
Yeah, I know.

21:42.897 --> 21:44.888
Thank you.

21:47.177 --> 21:50.613
- Ileana Jashari?
- Who is it?

21:51.897 --> 21:53.853
We're police offi...

22:00.297 --> 22:02.527
Did you know Stefan Tanzic?

22:11.857 --> 22:14.655
He is the one who did this to me.

22:22.297 --> 22:24.015
I just want you to know,

22:24.057 --> 22:26.093
he's dead.

22:38.897 --> 22:40.888
Allahu akbar.

22:52.497 --> 22:56.536
Remember that Tom Hanks movie
where he managed the girls' team?

22:56.577 --> 22:59.011
'There's no crying in baseball.'

22:59.057 --> 23:01.412
Maybe I should talk to Cragen.

23:01.457 --> 23:05.894
Ileana Jashari is physically
incapable of killing that pig.

23:06.697 --> 23:09.086
So, who's next?

23:15.977 --> 23:19.970
- You want to talk to my wife?
- Can you tell us where she is?

23:20.017 --> 23:23.566
She works at Fellowes & Kinsolving.
She's an architect.

23:23.617 --> 23:26.415
- What's this about?
- What time do you expect her?

23:26.457 --> 23:29.449
It varies. She's working on a project.

23:31.097 --> 23:35.534
I'll tell you what,
why don't you have her give us a call?

23:35.577 --> 23:38.011
Daddy, can I stop yet?

23:38.057 --> 23:40.048
OK.

23:40.897 --> 23:42.888
- Say hi.
- Hi.

23:42.937 --> 23:44.928
- Hi.
- Hi.

23:45.897 --> 23:47.091
Wow...

23:47.137 --> 23:49.697
- You want to go to the park?
- In a minute.

23:49.737 --> 23:53.332
- Is there anything else?
- How long have you been married?

23:54.337 --> 23:56.612
Go change your clothes, OK?

24:02.297 --> 24:04.652
A little over a year.

24:04.697 --> 24:08.576
I'm Nicky's stepfather.
My wife's first husband died.

24:18.097 --> 24:22.295
- Stefan Tanzic's the father of that boy.
- Yeah.

24:25.097 --> 24:27.452
That doesn't change anything.

24:27.497 --> 24:31.046
- I'm on the job, Elliot.
- I knew you would be.

24:31.097 --> 24:34.646
I got a conference
with one of my daughter's teachers.

24:34.697 --> 24:38.087
- Want me to drop you?
- I'm just going to walk this off.

24:39.097 --> 24:40.894
OK. See you.

25:07.697 --> 25:09.494
Yeah, I need an address.

25:17.697 --> 25:19.892
- She's over there.
- Thank you.

25:21.697 --> 25:23.494
- Marta Stevens?
- Yes.

25:23.537 --> 25:25.687
Detective Olivia Benson, NYPD.

25:25.737 --> 25:27.056
Oh.

25:27.097 --> 25:28.496
How can I help you?

25:28.537 --> 25:31.893
Just want to talk a minute.
Is there someplace more private?

25:31.937 --> 25:33.495
Yeah.

25:39.097 --> 25:41.895
- What's this about?
- I just have a few questions.

25:41.937 --> 25:44.690
Would you mind me
looking at your hands, please?

25:48.337 --> 25:50.487
Can you put them over, please?

25:53.097 --> 25:56.692
- I think you know why I'm here.
- No, I have no idea.

25:57.577 --> 26:00.614
- No idea?
- No.

26:02.497 --> 26:05.694
Stefan Tanzic was the father of your son.

26:06.697 --> 26:09.769
No, Robert is Nicky's father.

26:09.817 --> 26:12.092
And I'm sure a very good one.

26:13.297 --> 26:15.970
Where were you Tuesday night?

26:16.897 --> 26:20.492
Right here. I have a presentation
on Friday. Why?

26:21.297 --> 26:23.288
How late were you here?

26:24.337 --> 26:26.532
Late, very late. Maybe one o'clock.

26:27.497 --> 26:29.647
Was anybody else here with you?

26:29.697 --> 26:33.610
No, I was the last to leave.
Why are you asking these questions?

26:34.897 --> 26:37.616
Stefan Tanzic was murdered Tuesday night.

26:41.777 --> 26:44.496
Oh. I didn't know he was in New York.

26:46.897 --> 26:48.888
He was stabbed to death.

26:49.697 --> 26:51.688
His genitals were cut off.

26:52.897 --> 26:55.013
Yeah. So?

26:56.977 --> 27:00.174
So I can see that you are very affected by it.

27:02.697 --> 27:06.087
How would you feel if your neighbour
raped you for three weeks

27:06.137 --> 27:08.890
and the government gave him a medal?

27:08.937 --> 27:11.531
Stefan Tanzic was your neighbour?

27:11.577 --> 27:13.693
We went to grammar school together.

27:14.497 --> 27:18.854
When Sarajevo became insane,
I went to my cousin's in the mountains.

27:18.897 --> 27:21.650
Tanzic was an officer in the Serb army.

27:21.697 --> 27:23.892
His unit came into the village,

27:23.937 --> 27:26.690
took all the men, old men,

27:26.737 --> 27:31.174
and all the boys over seven to
the school and machine-gunned them.

27:32.497 --> 27:36.092
Then they took all the women
and children and put them into trucks.

27:39.697 --> 27:41.688
Tanzic picked me out.

27:41.737 --> 27:44.888
He said I was too pretty
to stay in the tents.

27:46.097 --> 27:48.088
That night, he raped me.

27:49.497 --> 27:52.694
He raped me every night for 23 days.

27:55.297 --> 27:59.051
Sometimes he was too drunk
so he did it with whatever was there.

27:59.097 --> 28:01.053
A wrench.

28:01.097 --> 28:02.689
A pistol.

28:03.697 --> 28:05.494
A broom handle.

28:06.497 --> 28:09.455
Every day he would handcuff me to his bed,

28:09.497 --> 28:13.285
and every night he would say
that maybe when he's tired of me,

28:13.337 --> 28:15.897
he would shoot me instead of using me.

28:19.497 --> 28:23.092
So, I'm not sorry he's dead.

28:31.897 --> 28:33.535
Anything else?

28:36.297 --> 28:39.289
No. Not at the moment.

28:40.497 --> 28:42.488
Thank you.

28:53.097 --> 28:57.454
I'm concerned that she still
writes her letters backwards.

28:57.497 --> 29:00.091
Her sisters never went through that.

29:00.137 --> 29:02.856
Well, her writing...

29:02.897 --> 29:04.489
Excuse me.

29:06.297 --> 29:08.049
Stabler.

29:08.097 --> 29:10.372
Yeah. Y'know, now's not a good time.

29:11.497 --> 29:13.852
You what?

29:13.897 --> 29:17.094
What were you thinking?
I thought you could handle this.

29:19.497 --> 29:21.692
Well, did she implicate herself?

29:22.697 --> 29:24.892
Did you tell her she was a suspect?

29:26.337 --> 29:28.692
I am upset!

29:28.737 --> 29:31.046
Fine. Let's talk about it in the morning.

29:34.697 --> 29:36.289
Thank you.

29:37.097 --> 29:39.486
Do you think she killed him?

29:40.137 --> 29:42.446
There's not a doubt in my mind.

29:42.497 --> 29:43.816
And?

29:43.857 --> 29:46.087
How do you feel about that?

29:46.137 --> 29:48.287
When that little boy came in

29:49.097 --> 29:52.089
and I realised that Tanzic was the father,

29:53.097 --> 29:56.055
part of me wished
I'd been in the cab with him.

29:56.097 --> 29:59.772
I really wish you would consider
getting out of that unit.

29:59.817 --> 30:03.890
- Come on, Mother, let's not...
- Do you think it is healthy for you?

30:03.937 --> 30:07.771
You were raped, for God's sake.
Are you saying you don't understand

30:07.817 --> 30:09.773
why she did what she did?

30:09.817 --> 30:13.446
I understand it.
That does not mean I condone it.

30:13.497 --> 30:16.489
Wait. Are you saying
you wouldn't have done

30:16.537 --> 30:18.573
exactly the same if you had the chance?

30:18.617 --> 30:22.292
- Is that what you would want of me?
- Yes.

30:26.377 --> 30:28.254
How old is that little boy?

30:29.297 --> 30:30.855
He's five.

30:30.897 --> 30:33.570
Will he be better off
with his mother in prison?

30:34.697 --> 30:38.292
Do you think you would have been
better off with me in prison

30:38.337 --> 30:41.090
the whole time you were growing up?

30:42.297 --> 30:45.494
I hate him for what he did to you.

30:47.097 --> 30:49.008
So do I.

30:49.057 --> 30:51.093
And if he hadn't,

30:52.097 --> 30:54.053
you would not be here.

31:09.097 --> 31:12.487
- You don't think she murdered him?
- No.

31:12.537 --> 31:14.732
I don't think she murdered him.

31:15.737 --> 31:18.695
She said she was in her office
till around one.

31:19.697 --> 31:22.006
That's after he was killed.

31:22.897 --> 31:26.287
- And no one else was there.
- No one else was there.

31:26.337 --> 31:29.693
No one else was there.
That is an anti-alibi.

31:29.737 --> 31:33.889
Elliot, I saw her hands.
There are no broken fingernails.

31:37.897 --> 31:40.365
We know there are two killers so...

31:41.897 --> 31:44.695
How are we going to find the other one?

31:44.737 --> 31:47.854
You mean the other one
who also didn't do it?

31:48.697 --> 31:51.769
We got three other
Tanzic victims to check out.

31:51.817 --> 31:53.773
Let's do that.

31:54.697 --> 31:56.688
Being in Europe, that's an alibi.

31:56.737 --> 31:58.693
Who's next?

31:59.497 --> 32:02.887
Anya Rugova,
owns a restaurant on the East Side.

32:02.937 --> 32:04.336
Sarajevo.

32:07.697 --> 32:09.096
Yes?

32:09.137 --> 32:10.855
- Anya Rugova?
- Yes.

32:10.897 --> 32:14.606
Hi, I'm Detective Stabler,
this is Detective Benson.

32:14.657 --> 32:17.012
Do you know a man named Stefan Tanzic?

32:17.057 --> 32:19.207
Years ago, in Yugoslavia.

32:19.257 --> 32:20.975
How did you know him?

32:21.017 --> 32:25.135
He murdered my husband
and my grandson with a hatchet.

32:26.097 --> 32:28.895
Could you tell us
where you were Tuesday night?

32:28.937 --> 32:31.371
- Why?
- Stefan Tanzic was murdered,

32:31.417 --> 32:34.887
late Tuesday night
or early Wednesday morning.

32:34.937 --> 32:36.370
Good.

32:38.137 --> 32:41.288
Now, would you mind
answering our question?

32:41.337 --> 32:43.805
I was here, we closed around one o'clock.

32:55.617 --> 32:58.654
- Anything else?
- How'd you hurt your hand?

33:00.457 --> 33:02.049
Kitchen accident.

33:05.057 --> 33:07.048
Do you know a Marta Stevens?

33:09.697 --> 33:13.895
Stevens? No. I don't think
I know anybody by that name.

33:14.697 --> 33:16.335
I must get back to work.

33:17.137 --> 33:19.093
You agree she knows Marta Stevens?

33:19.137 --> 33:22.288
She's not a very good liar.
'I don't think I knew her'?

33:22.337 --> 33:25.090
- Did you check out the bandage?
- Left hand.

33:25.137 --> 33:27.856
You heard what Rodgers said
about the wounds.

33:27.897 --> 33:30.286
It's hard to stab with your left hand.

33:30.337 --> 33:31.895
Unless you're left-handed.

33:31.937 --> 33:34.292
She signed the bill with her right hand.

33:34.337 --> 33:37.886
That signature of a five-year-old!
She's left-handed.

33:37.937 --> 33:41.088
Besides, we'll get a DNA match
on the fingernail.

33:41.137 --> 33:43.697
It could have been in the cab for a month.

33:44.337 --> 33:46.897
- For a month?
- Yeah.

33:48.897 --> 33:51.889
Theory of the crime.
Stop me when you don't agree.

33:51.937 --> 33:55.088
One of them gets in the cab,
my bet is on Rugova.

33:55.897 --> 33:59.094
She recognises Tanzic.
He doesn't recognise her.

33:59.137 --> 34:01.890
She checks the name on the licence,

34:01.937 --> 34:05.088
finds out when he works,
calls Marta Stevens.

34:05.137 --> 34:08.094
They wait outside the coffee shop,
get in his cab.

34:09.297 --> 34:11.094
End of story, Olivia.

34:12.976 --> 34:16.686
It could be them, but I told you,
it was dark where they crossed.

34:16.737 --> 34:19.297
It's OK, just take a look at them.

34:19.337 --> 34:23.694
I could look at them all day,
it wouldn't do any good. I am sorry.

34:24.697 --> 34:28.485
- You sure they saw you?
- Oh, yes, that I am quite certain.

34:28.536 --> 34:30.527
You've been a big help.

34:32.897 --> 34:35.695
- We don't have a case.
- Oh, yeah, we do.

34:35.737 --> 34:38.092
- There's no proof.
- They don't know that.

34:38.137 --> 34:40.092
- Elliot.
- We arrest them. Now.

34:40.137 --> 34:42.731
A first-year law student could get them out.

34:42.777 --> 34:45.085
- Not if they confess.
- I'm not.

34:45.137 --> 34:47.092
You are.

34:56.297 --> 35:01.087
- Would you please stand up, Mrs Stevens?
- What's this about?

35:01.137 --> 35:04.015
You're under arrest
for the murder of Stefan Tanzic.

35:04.057 --> 35:06.571
We've got the younger one in custody.

35:06.617 --> 35:09.689
Send a car to meet us
at 71st and 2nd Ave.

35:09.737 --> 35:12.695
I want 'em transported separately.

35:12.737 --> 35:16.696
Yes, sir. A positive ID from
the Sikh cab driver at the coffee shop.

35:20.097 --> 35:21.894
How can you do this?

35:22.497 --> 35:25.091
Please put your feet in the car.

35:29.777 --> 35:32.575
Listen to me.

35:32.617 --> 35:35.893
I know what a shock it must've been
to see Tanzic in that cab.

35:35.937 --> 35:40.647
Don't talk to anybody without your lawyer.
No one. Say nothing.

35:41.697 --> 35:43.972
- Hey. You call for backup?
- Yeah.

35:44.017 --> 35:46.167
Ah, Miss Slice And Dice.

35:46.217 --> 35:48.572
The psychodrama over inside or what?

35:48.617 --> 35:52.496
We also recovered a fingernail.
We'll get a DNA match on that.

35:53.297 --> 35:55.891
- Am I under arrest?
- Yes.

35:55.937 --> 35:57.893
You are.

35:57.937 --> 36:00.292
You have the right to remain silent.

36:00.337 --> 36:03.886
- May I call my lawyer?
- By all means.

36:14.737 --> 36:16.216
- No!
- Oh, God!

36:16.257 --> 36:17.690
No! No!

36:17.737 --> 36:19.693
Get back! Back! Drop the knife!

36:19.737 --> 36:22.251
- No! No!
- Somebody get the knife!

36:22.297 --> 36:25.369
Put down the knife. Mrs Rugova, please.

36:29.817 --> 36:32.331
Call 911. 911. Get an ambulance.

36:34.497 --> 36:37.933
This is Detective Benson,
Sex Crimes. I need an ambulance.

36:37.977 --> 36:40.696
We're at 72nd and 2nd Avenue. Now!

36:40.737 --> 36:43.535
- How bad is it?
- She got the femoral artery.

36:47.937 --> 36:51.054
Please, don't help me.

36:52.497 --> 36:55.773
- She's bleeding out.
- Stay with us.

37:05.497 --> 37:08.694
As soon as we heard his voice
we recognised him.

37:09.537 --> 37:11.926
And where were you at this point?

37:11.977 --> 37:13.933
I don't know.

37:13.977 --> 37:15.933
Somewhere downtown.

37:17.297 --> 37:20.050
I heard his voice and looked at Anya.

37:22.897 --> 37:25.092
I thought I was going to faint.

37:25.897 --> 37:28.695
- What happened then?
- I don't remember.

37:29.737 --> 37:32.092
I started to feel hot all over.

37:33.697 --> 37:36.291
My head started to spin.

37:37.497 --> 37:41.695
Then Anya reached through
the divider and stabbed him in the head.

37:41.737 --> 37:44.297
And then we were both stabbing him.

37:45.097 --> 37:47.895
And the car... went up on the kerb.

37:47.937 --> 37:50.053
And we... we were out of the car

37:50.097 --> 37:53.646
and we pulled open the front doors
and stabbed him more.

37:53.697 --> 37:56.257
And again and again.

37:57.217 --> 37:59.333
I was seeing him

37:59.377 --> 38:01.493
taking his clothes off.

38:02.297 --> 38:05.095
I was feeling him pushing into me.

38:06.257 --> 38:08.293
Forcing me.

38:11.897 --> 38:14.969
I think you've got enough, don't you?

38:26.097 --> 38:29.294
I have to run it by Schiff
but I'm willing to take a plea.

38:29.337 --> 38:32.090
- Man one?
- I'll take man two and smile.

38:32.137 --> 38:35.891
Severe emotional distress.
I sure as hell don't want to go to trial.

38:35.937 --> 38:41.136
If they get Tanzic's war crimes indictment in,
and her friend's suicide, and she'll walk.

38:41.177 --> 38:42.974
- How much time?
- My guess,

38:43.017 --> 38:46.896
with the right judge,
18 months in a psychiatric facility.

38:51.497 --> 38:53.692
You two all right with that?

38:55.297 --> 38:57.174
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

38:57.217 --> 38:59.094
Yeah.

39:00.097 --> 39:03.487
Get her transported,
I'll have her arraigned, minimal bail.

39:03.537 --> 39:05.892
She'll be home with her kid for dinner.

39:05.937 --> 39:07.290
Thanks, Abbie.

39:07.337 --> 39:09.214
My office, now.

39:20.297 --> 39:23.687
That's nice. The game
with the Sikh non-eyewitness?

39:23.737 --> 39:26.331
That's good police work
but it ain't man two.

39:26.377 --> 39:27.969
- We don't...
- Shut up!

39:29.697 --> 39:32.530
What about the call
asking when Spicer worked?

39:33.697 --> 39:36.609
The dispatcher couldn't tell
if it was a man or woman.

39:36.657 --> 39:39.774
Whoever called could've wanted
the real Victor Spicer.

39:39.817 --> 39:41.773
My ass.

39:41.817 --> 39:45.332
Let me ask you something.
I read the autopsy report.

39:45.377 --> 39:47.811
Do you really believe that those two ladies

39:47.857 --> 39:51.213
walked around with those knives
in their purses every day?

39:51.257 --> 39:54.727
We did the one thing
that will allow me to sleep tonight.

40:04.097 --> 40:08.090
You used your Get Out Of Jail Free
card on this case, Olivia.

40:09.297 --> 40:11.492
There's only one in the pack.

40:36.497 --> 40:39.057
She said something to you, didn't she?

40:42.097 --> 40:44.895
'I just want to be with my family.'
