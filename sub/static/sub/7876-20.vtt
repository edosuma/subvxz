00:37.487 --> 00:38.845
Hey guys.
What's so funny?

00:38.970 --> 00:41.432
You talking about last night's
<i>How I Met Your Mother</i> ?

00:41.766 --> 00:43.150
I love that Barney guy.

00:43.275 --> 00:45.459
"Get your suit on!"
What a catchphrase!

00:45.584 --> 00:48.809
No, Stan, we were out
last night partying. Hard.

00:48.934 --> 00:51.637
Oh man, remember
that dental hygienist we met?

00:51.762 --> 00:53.262
Spit and rinse!

00:55.677 --> 00:58.938
- I wish I knew what that meant.
- Why don't you come out with us?

00:59.063 --> 01:02.372
- We're doing it again tonight.
- I promised Francine I'd come home.

01:02.497 --> 01:05.053
She says we have some cheese I have
to finish or it's going to go bad.

01:05.178 --> 01:07.108
Come on! Blow her off!

01:07.276 --> 01:08.867
I wish, but I made a promise.

01:08.992 --> 01:11.524
And Stan Smith has never broken
a promise.

01:11.668 --> 01:13.239
You know it's true, Gil!

01:15.628 --> 01:17.589
It is so hot in here.

01:18.262 --> 01:19.532
You're missing out.

01:19.657 --> 01:21.591
I'd say we'll think of you,
but we won't.

01:23.193 --> 01:25.770
It was at my expense,
but I'm sharing in the laughter.

01:25.895 --> 01:28.144
Part of the group.
I'm part of the group.

01:28.269 --> 01:29.463
And now I'm alone.

01:30.076 --> 01:33.133
Hey, you don't need them.
You're the coolest agent here.

01:33.258 --> 01:35.229
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

01:35.818 --> 01:38.187
Will you buy $60-worth of licorice
from my daughter?

01:38.312 --> 01:40.562
She wants to play soccer in Europe.

01:44.428 --> 01:47.175
I just had my colors done
and Lydia tells me I'm an autumn.

01:47.300 --> 01:50.106
Roger, I've been standing with you
here the whole time.

01:50.231 --> 01:52.976
You haven't talked to anybody, and
you're putting lipstick on your eyelids.

01:53.101 --> 01:54.225
You're just jealous.

01:54.350 --> 01:57.640
If you fixed yourself up a little,
men would find you attractive, too.

01:57.765 --> 01:58.855
Instead of wondering

01:58.980 --> 02:01.245
if you're in the middle
of gender reassignment surgery.

02:01.502 --> 02:04.373
Please. Men find me way more attractive
than you.

02:05.584 --> 02:07.960
Five El Pollo Loco coupons
says you're wrong.

02:08.202 --> 02:09.878
- You're on.
- Damn right I'm on.

02:10.003 --> 02:11.104
I'm on fire.

02:12.588 --> 02:13.588
Nip slip.

02:29.103 --> 02:32.710
They're not smiling back at me
because they think you're my husband.

02:36.261 --> 02:38.027
<i>All right now, it's time</i>

02:38.152 --> 02:40.951
<i>for Bernie's Gardening Tip
of the Week.</i>

02:41.150 --> 02:44.294
<i>If you want to start
your lawnmower on the first pull,</i>

02:44.419 --> 02:47.166
<i>here's a trick most people
do not know.</i>

02:47.390 --> 02:50.518
<i>You stand on the back tires
of the mower</i>

02:50.809 --> 02:54.006
<i>and pull the cord
straight towards your chest.</i>

02:54.255 --> 02:57.119
<i>It starts the first time,
every time.</i>

02:59.246 --> 03:01.492
I think I want another plate
of mac and cheese.

03:01.617 --> 03:03.551
How about a plate
of my nads and cheese!

03:03.676 --> 03:05.214
Stan, how explosive.

03:05.339 --> 03:07.858
- What's going on?
- I'll tell you what's going on!

03:07.983 --> 03:10.286
All the guys at work get to go out
and have fun

03:10.411 --> 03:11.976
while I'm stuck here every night.

03:12.183 --> 03:13.333
"Stuck" here?

03:13.458 --> 03:15.591
Stan, if you want to go out, go out.

03:15.716 --> 03:17.655
I'll have a nice evening alone.

03:17.780 --> 03:20.913
Curl up with a book,
maybe write a song.

03:23.083 --> 03:25.544
There's my melody.
I'm halfway there.

03:26.251 --> 03:28.450
I'm going to do man stuff tonight!

03:32.632 --> 03:34.132
Who could sing this?

03:34.814 --> 03:36.885
Avril Lavigne. She sucks.

03:38.621 --> 03:41.400
This thong gives me an ass rash,
but the boys love it.

03:41.525 --> 03:44.114
Give it up, Roger.
You're not more attractive than me.

03:44.239 --> 03:46.483
No one smiled at either of us
at the mall today.

03:46.608 --> 03:49.061
You guys were at the mall?
Maybe this is about you.

03:49.416 --> 03:52.099
It's a "Missed Connections" posting
on Craigslist.

03:52.224 --> 03:55.531
"You: Cute brunette with friend
at mall next to hat kiosk.

03:55.656 --> 03:57.456
"Me: Too shy to say hello."

03:58.339 --> 04:01.574
I was the cute brunette at the mall.
He's talking about me.

04:01.834 --> 04:04.580
How do you know that I'm not cute
and your friend?

04:04.705 --> 04:07.141
He says to meet him tonight
at the food court.

04:07.266 --> 04:09.416
He'll be wearing a green sweater.

04:09.541 --> 04:10.958
You should both go.

04:11.266 --> 04:13.377
The one he walks up to
is the cute one!

04:13.565 --> 04:14.636
Okay. We'll go.

04:14.761 --> 04:17.214
And this time, Hayley,
we'll prove who's more of a woman.

04:19.314 --> 04:21.197
Roger, did you draw that on?

04:21.995 --> 04:22.995
Aroused?

04:23.736 --> 04:24.889
It's not for you!

04:28.035 --> 04:31.990
Did someone order a spot-on
Rosie Perez impersonator?

04:33.284 --> 04:34.095
No way!

04:34.220 --> 04:35.566
Look who escaped.

04:35.841 --> 04:38.773
Went to the ATM,
busted out my $40 Quick Cash,

04:38.898 --> 04:40.965
I got my comb, I'm ready to party.

04:41.669 --> 04:44.203
My friends,
I would like to make a toast.

04:44.328 --> 04:46.730
To Stan getting away
from his wife for the night,

04:46.855 --> 04:50.070
and me getting away from mine...
forever!

04:50.195 --> 04:53.002
Yep, my divorce from Sheila
became final today.

04:53.127 --> 04:54.315
I'm a free man.

04:54.440 --> 04:55.540
Yeah, buddy!

04:56.873 --> 05:00.319
She got it all:
the house, the car, even the dog.

05:00.699 --> 05:01.925
Ungrateful mutt.

05:02.050 --> 05:03.552
And I'm talking about Sheila.

05:05.307 --> 05:08.103
I thought it was the dog.
You were talking about your ex-wife.

05:08.228 --> 05:10.265
I know.
It was a joke and I got it.

05:10.390 --> 05:11.602
I'm one of the guys!

05:16.101 --> 05:17.401
Nathan! Stop it!

05:17.895 --> 05:20.362
This is why
you keep getting molested.

05:27.611 --> 05:28.953
Okay, let's whip 'em out.

05:29.259 --> 05:31.683
- Our wieners?
- No, our credit cards.

05:31.808 --> 05:33.236
It's credit card roulette.

05:33.361 --> 05:35.208
Whoever loses pays the bill.

05:35.497 --> 05:36.797
The whole bill?!

05:36.995 --> 05:39.213
That's four times
what I was expecting to spend.

05:39.382 --> 05:41.420
Yeah, it's a total rush.

05:45.044 --> 05:46.894
Do us the honor, would you?

05:48.788 --> 05:49.923
Dick Reynolds.

05:52.277 --> 05:53.886
When she pulled out that card,

05:54.011 --> 05:56.747
it looked exactly like my card,
but then it wasn't my card.

05:56.872 --> 05:59.959
It wasn't my card at all.
It was Dick's card. Now Dick has to pay.

06:00.084 --> 06:02.069
Okay, everyone ready to go
to the cigar bar?

06:02.194 --> 06:03.703
Two places in one night!

06:03.828 --> 06:05.678
- You guys are wild.
- So,

06:06.196 --> 06:07.956
you guys keeping this party going?

06:10.070 --> 06:12.830
Stoagies! Stoagies! Stoagies!

06:14.257 --> 06:15.994
I am so glad I came out tonight.

06:16.210 --> 06:18.819
Better than sitting at home
with the wife, bored out of my...

06:22.110 --> 06:24.918
I have a guy who can fix this right up.
I'll pay for the whole thing.

06:25.043 --> 06:27.789
That's great, but I still have
to report it to my insurance.

06:27.914 --> 06:29.930
Oh sure, I understand.

06:30.098 --> 06:32.643
Let me get my info.
I really appreciate you...

06:34.394 --> 06:37.210
- Dick, what the hell?!
- I've got three DUIs, Stan.

06:37.335 --> 06:39.333
One more
and they take away my license.

06:42.502 --> 06:43.573
What are you doing?

06:43.698 --> 06:45.822
We can't leave him here.
He'll call the cops.

06:45.947 --> 06:48.831
I'm not gonna let this jackass
ruin our night.

06:49.835 --> 06:51.368
Please don't do this!

06:51.911 --> 06:54.059
You guys, we have to take this man
to the hospital!

06:54.184 --> 06:55.584
And lose our buzz?

06:55.744 --> 06:57.678
Come on, the night's just begun.

06:57.803 --> 06:59.752
Yeah, we're just getting started.

07:00.094 --> 07:02.293
Please, I think I have a concussion.

07:02.418 --> 07:04.631
What if I fall asleep?
I could die in here.

07:04.917 --> 07:08.135
You can't worry about what-ifs, friend.
You got to live in the moment.

07:15.340 --> 07:17.816
Nothing more relaxing
than a nice cigar.

07:17.941 --> 07:20.361
Look guys, we have to get that man
to a hospital.

07:20.486 --> 07:21.924
Relax, Stan,

07:22.182 --> 07:24.371
this kind of thing
happens all the time.

07:24.496 --> 07:27.863
Yeah, last week we snuck into the zoo
and Sanders fought a panda.

07:28.183 --> 07:29.625
That's where I got this.

07:32.311 --> 07:35.534
I heard they shot Cilantro's
<i>El Perro</i> video in the bathroom.

07:35.659 --> 07:37.135
Gonna go check it out.

07:46.753 --> 07:50.408
Hang tough in there, buddy. I'm gonna
get you to a hospital, I promise.

07:57.663 --> 08:00.140
- You know why I pulled you over.
- Did I forget to signal?

08:00.265 --> 08:02.564
You're missing the front portion
of your vehicle, sir.

08:04.633 --> 08:07.664
Well, I could be missing
the bottom portion of my clothes

08:07.789 --> 08:10.974
if that would "get me off"
with a warning.

08:11.766 --> 08:12.664
Help!

08:12.789 --> 08:14.930
Did I just hear someone yell
from your trunk?

08:15.278 --> 08:18.986
I have a ventriloquist act!
But instead of a dummy, I use a car.

08:19.111 --> 08:21.794
It's hard to book gigs.
Most stages can't accommodate a car.

08:21.919 --> 08:24.463
But I'm an artist,
so that's the life I chose.

08:24.588 --> 08:26.547
Sir, get out of the car
and open the trunk.

08:32.366 --> 08:34.616
Dick, that's an officer of the law.

08:35.645 --> 08:38.267
What's wrong with you?
Don't you know how to knock a guy out?

08:38.498 --> 08:40.398
Yeah, you knock out guys
like a girl.

08:41.082 --> 08:42.789
Do I mess up hair like a girl?

08:44.258 --> 08:45.880
Hey come on!
Dick, don't.

08:46.005 --> 08:47.872
Dick...
Come on, Dick.

08:47.997 --> 08:50.249
Why are you doing this, Dick?
This isn't you.

08:50.374 --> 08:51.933
I want the old Dick back.

08:52.058 --> 08:54.553
I don't want bad new Dick,
I want good old Dick.

08:54.678 --> 08:57.302
Give me the Dick I'm used to.
Give me the Dick I love.

08:57.427 --> 08:59.260
Guys!
Knock it off.

09:04.195 --> 09:05.335
A trunk buddy!

09:06.470 --> 09:09.074
So... do you like <i>30 Rock</i> ?

09:09.199 --> 09:10.199
Shut up.

09:11.152 --> 09:12.787
Yeah, I'm a fan.

09:18.892 --> 09:22.896
My knight in shimmering green sweater
is going to be here any minute.

09:24.041 --> 09:25.719
Samn it.
Damn thong.

09:27.336 --> 09:29.509
I really should not be shaking
anyone's hand.

09:29.634 --> 09:30.846
There he is.

09:33.367 --> 09:35.678
He's a looker.
Don't stare at him.

09:35.803 --> 09:36.514
Sit!

09:37.218 --> 09:38.818
Get used to that, dog.

09:49.356 --> 09:51.089
- I'm Tyler.
- I'm Amber.

09:51.214 --> 09:53.188
Give me waves of grain alcohol,

09:53.313 --> 09:56.200
and we'll see how purple
your majesty gets.

09:56.768 --> 09:58.722
- What?
- It's from a song.

10:04.053 --> 10:06.065
We really saved you back there,
Stan.

10:06.190 --> 10:09.040
We have two men bleeding to death
in the trunk.

10:09.165 --> 10:12.091
Let's just get them to the hospital,
unload them in front, and drive away.

10:12.216 --> 10:14.740
- Okay, if it'll shut you...
- I'm fine!

10:14.865 --> 10:16.698
Dick, are-are you crying?

10:18.295 --> 10:19.368
It's nothing.

10:19.537 --> 10:21.976
Dick says it's nothing.
So, to get to the hospital, make a left.

10:22.101 --> 10:23.301
I miss my dog!

10:23.952 --> 10:24.952
Biscuit!

10:25.222 --> 10:26.956
I miss Biscuit!

10:27.969 --> 10:29.617
She took him.

10:30.405 --> 10:32.004
No, the hospital's the other way.

10:32.273 --> 10:33.882
I'm coming to get you, Biscuit!

10:40.447 --> 10:43.225
Dick, come on, we gotta get
those guys to the hospital.

10:43.630 --> 10:45.830
Damn it, Sheila changed the locks.

10:49.918 --> 10:52.317
You take the front,
I'll take the back.

10:54.364 --> 10:56.363
Cheese and crackers!
That hurt!

10:58.278 --> 11:00.951
You get out of here right now
or I'm calling the police!

11:01.234 --> 11:03.162
I'm taking the damn dog, Sheila!

11:03.287 --> 11:04.472
Don't try to stop me!

11:04.597 --> 11:06.248
Sheila, who are you talking to?

11:08.258 --> 11:11.253
- Al?
- That's right, I'm nailing your barber!

11:11.463 --> 11:13.063
You're a dead man, Al!

11:15.053 --> 11:16.053
Stop it!

11:16.338 --> 11:17.622
Leave him alone!

11:17.747 --> 11:20.209
This ain't the first time
I fought naked.

11:22.382 --> 11:24.433
Now, that's how you knock a guy out.

11:26.814 --> 11:28.812
Bring him back, you monsters!

11:30.804 --> 11:33.442
He's naked.
Can't you put him in the other way?

11:34.994 --> 11:37.246
Don't worry, guys, I'm gonna
get you out of this. I promise.

11:37.371 --> 11:39.041
Where are you going, you mug?

11:39.166 --> 11:42.600
Since we're not social anymore,
I feel I can tell you this.

11:42.725 --> 11:45.875
I'm the one who clogged the toilet
on your houseboat.

11:49.733 --> 11:52.002
Roger, don't you look beautiful.

11:52.353 --> 11:55.172
Tyler invited me to a party tonight.
Semi-formal.

11:55.975 --> 11:57.425
I envy you, Hayley.

11:57.763 --> 12:01.613
Never having to worry about things
like pantyhose or contraception.

12:03.594 --> 12:04.944
No babies for me.

12:10.980 --> 12:13.112
This house is beautiful.

12:13.237 --> 12:16.360
Reminds me of my sority.
We were known as the pretty house.

12:16.663 --> 12:20.414
Then crystal meth got its hooks into us.
Fortunately, I was just selling it.

12:20.539 --> 12:22.784
The girls all got Hepatis,
I bought a Jaguar.

12:22.909 --> 12:25.593
It's in Canada right now.
That's why I rode my bike over here.

12:25.718 --> 12:27.668
I'm gonna go to the bar.

12:27.793 --> 12:29.775
- Would you like something?
- I'll have an orgasm.

12:29.900 --> 12:32.500
And for my drink
I'd like a bannaa daiquiri.

12:33.196 --> 12:35.730
Oh, you, you are in for a treat.

12:37.097 --> 12:39.257
- Hi, I'm Amber.
- Hi, I'm Stephanie.

12:39.619 --> 12:41.607
I just met my date today.

12:41.732 --> 12:45.476
He saw me at the mall and asked me out.
That's how attractive I am.

12:45.623 --> 12:47.683
I just met my date today, too.

12:47.808 --> 12:49.055
That's funny.

12:49.180 --> 12:51.738
I also met my date today.

12:51.863 --> 12:53.963
This is the best pig party ever!

12:54.920 --> 12:55.920
Pig party?

12:56.295 --> 12:59.545
Where guys find
the ugliest dates they can?

13:07.900 --> 13:08.900
I'm a pig.

13:13.336 --> 13:15.971
Stan, this is boring.
Going to the hospital is boring.

13:16.096 --> 13:17.635
We're almost there.

13:17.760 --> 13:18.760
Hookers!

13:19.464 --> 13:21.347
It went in my mouth!

13:21.593 --> 13:22.931
I was yawning!

13:25.748 --> 13:29.365
What are you fine-ass ladies
doing out here all alone?

13:29.490 --> 13:30.863
Selling our bodies.

13:30.988 --> 13:33.018
- Sold! Get in!
- No, don't get in!

13:33.187 --> 13:35.147
Now, we're going
to the hospital and that's...

13:44.431 --> 13:47.367
You brought hookers to the CIA!
We're all gonna get fired!

13:48.335 --> 13:51.143
And I'm not even at my desk!
I'm at Duper's desk!

13:51.268 --> 13:55.208
Duper's phone has speed-dial buttons.
Who does he need to call so fast?

13:55.507 --> 13:58.787
Listen, thanks for all the sex,
but we're in a recession

13:58.912 --> 14:02.063
and the last thing I should be spending
money on is a prostitute.

14:02.188 --> 14:03.197
So I'm not.

14:04.975 --> 14:07.181
I think I'm falling in love
with you.

14:07.306 --> 14:08.706
Let's get married.

14:09.117 --> 14:11.547
Did you take the guys to the hospital?
They could die!

14:11.672 --> 14:15.495
They're still in the trunk. We're having
a party. Come on, man, loosen up.

14:15.620 --> 14:17.939
I promised I'd get those guys
to the hospital.

14:18.227 --> 14:19.846
And I don't break a promise.

14:20.723 --> 14:23.342
- You don't pull a gun on a bro.
- That's right.

14:23.467 --> 14:26.865
Stan, if you wanna put that gun to good
use then shoot my hooker's penis off.

14:27.094 --> 14:29.019
- Throw me the car keys.
- I just had them.

14:29.144 --> 14:31.369
- Where'd they go?
- Hey, look, it's Misty!

14:35.573 --> 14:37.072
She stole Dick's car!

14:37.197 --> 14:38.627
Those guys are in the trunk!

14:38.880 --> 14:40.280
You knew about me?

14:41.182 --> 14:42.782
I knew the whole time.

14:47.079 --> 14:49.613
This is bad, this is bad.
Those guys were in the trunk.

14:49.738 --> 14:51.457
- What are we gonna do?
- I have LoJack.

14:51.582 --> 14:53.910
We can find out
where she took my car.

14:59.746 --> 15:01.024
"Fernando Jaramillo."

15:02.362 --> 15:05.776
Good, we all know who he is, so wewon't
waste time explaining it to each other.

15:05.901 --> 15:07.235
I don't know who he is.

15:07.360 --> 15:08.982
Oh, well let me explain it to you.

15:09.107 --> 15:13.100
Jaramillo is the most ruthless killer
and crime lord on the eastern seaboard.

15:13.225 --> 15:16.275
But why would the hooker
take your car to this guy?

15:16.408 --> 15:18.780
Probably to sell it
'cause Dick refused to pay her.

15:18.905 --> 15:20.276
Dick don't pay for strange.

15:20.401 --> 15:22.212
You know that.
Look at my mug.

15:24.008 --> 15:26.800
When Jaramillo finds a cop in the trunk,
he'll kill them all!

15:27.076 --> 15:28.635
So, we're good?

15:28.804 --> 15:32.132
No! We gotta get 'em back!
And I'm not going in there alone.

15:32.257 --> 15:35.064
All you do is bitch and moan
and pull guns on us.

15:35.189 --> 15:36.439
You suck, Stan!

15:36.875 --> 15:39.686
Well, hold on, now.
I have one more question.

15:40.174 --> 15:43.207
- How old do you boys think I am?
- 55?

15:43.552 --> 15:44.552
57.

15:54.611 --> 15:56.261
Biscuit, coming in hot!

16:02.209 --> 16:03.618
What a spread.

16:03.946 --> 16:06.089
Looks like you wanna spread 'em
for Jaramillo.

16:19.302 --> 16:21.178
They're gone!
They must be dead!

16:21.521 --> 16:23.016
So... we're good?

16:29.860 --> 16:32.010
I promised I'd come back for you.

16:41.960 --> 16:44.878
You are trespassing on my property.

16:45.327 --> 16:46.327
CIA.

16:47.511 --> 16:50.028
CIA? Very impressive.

17:02.448 --> 17:04.189
Thank you for my new belt buckle.

17:04.423 --> 17:06.483
Those are like 50 bucks to replace.

17:06.685 --> 17:08.323
You four get out.

17:08.603 --> 17:10.553
These three men belong to me.

17:10.864 --> 17:13.421
I bought the car
and they were in the trunk.

17:13.597 --> 17:16.497
This was also in the trunk,
so it is also mine.

17:17.371 --> 17:18.662
My beach supplies!

17:18.890 --> 17:21.145
- Are you gonna kill us?
- Yes.

17:21.270 --> 17:23.895
In addition to chopping cars
for parts,

17:24.020 --> 17:26.336
I've also started chopping humans.

17:26.638 --> 17:28.201
Want to know the irony?

17:28.326 --> 17:32.092
I sell hearts
but I've never been in love.

17:32.316 --> 17:34.187
I'm not leaving without those guys.

17:34.312 --> 17:36.062
Then you are not leaving.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.179
Stan, it's over.
There's nothing you can do.

17:40.304 --> 17:41.303
Oh, really?

17:41.428 --> 17:42.578
Now, Biscuit!

17:50.106 --> 17:52.580
You think I'd come in here
without a plan B?

17:52.791 --> 17:53.781
Now, Cheesers!

17:55.497 --> 17:57.867
Coward!
I gave you everything!

18:00.485 --> 18:03.120
<i>It starts the first time,
every time.</i>

18:05.671 --> 18:07.197
Are you a betting man?

18:07.322 --> 18:08.134
Go on.

18:08.259 --> 18:10.005
You see that lawnmower over there?

18:10.130 --> 18:13.178
If I can start it ten times in a row
without a single stall,

18:13.303 --> 18:14.622
then you set them free.

18:14.747 --> 18:17.512
And if you don't, I cut off your leg
with that chainsaw.

18:18.929 --> 18:20.767
Okay, we have that.
Put a pin in it.

18:20.892 --> 18:22.525
Or, and get ready for this,

18:22.650 --> 18:25.500
I will give you
a free tarot card reading.

18:26.853 --> 18:28.403
Know your future.

18:28.662 --> 18:31.109
What mysteries does the deck
hold for you?

18:32.219 --> 18:34.653
- Nah, I want your leg.
- Suit yourself.

18:34.822 --> 18:37.087
- Stan, don't do this!
- This is crazy!

18:37.212 --> 18:39.743
Trust me, I know a little something
about lawnmowers.

18:48.748 --> 18:49.948
Give it a sec.

18:52.925 --> 18:54.025
There it goes!

18:54.306 --> 18:55.327
She's a beaut!

18:55.833 --> 18:57.083
What'd you pay for it?

18:57.927 --> 18:59.262
Oh, I'm out of gas.

18:59.637 --> 19:02.139
Escort these three
off of my property.

19:03.857 --> 19:06.269
Bye, boys.
It was a memorable night.

19:07.350 --> 19:09.809
It was a real honor
partying with you.

19:13.399 --> 19:14.916
It's over, Biscuit.

19:16.447 --> 19:17.799
Okay, hop up.

19:18.209 --> 19:20.517
I already have a buyer for your leg.

19:20.642 --> 19:23.692
I'm going to shave it
and sell it to Heather Mills.

19:33.004 --> 19:35.680
- What are you doing here?
- I thought you were at a party.

19:35.805 --> 19:37.905
He turned out to be a real jerk.

19:38.055 --> 19:39.923
And it made me realize something.

19:40.048 --> 19:41.798
I was a real jerk to you.

19:42.107 --> 19:43.551
We shouldn't be fighting.

19:43.676 --> 19:47.018
It's ridiculous to let other people
judge us based on how we look.

19:47.187 --> 19:48.535
Well, thanks, Roger.

19:48.660 --> 19:51.872
What do you say I go change
and take you out for an apology drink?

19:51.997 --> 19:52.982
You're on.

19:54.422 --> 19:56.886
- Roger, why are we at a frat...
- Hey, everybody!

19:57.011 --> 19:59.191
Is this hog a blue ribbon or what?

19:59.316 --> 20:01.658
Suey! Pig-pig- pig-pig-piggy!

20:02.928 --> 20:06.148
Relax, I don't expect to win.
I'm just hoping to place.

20:13.170 --> 20:14.547
What are you surprised about?

20:14.672 --> 20:16.928
You left me with a guy
who was about to cut my leg off.

20:17.053 --> 20:18.794
What'd you think was gonna happen?

20:27.494 --> 20:29.561
Dude, how did you get out of that?

20:29.906 --> 20:31.356
Cheesers came back.

20:31.605 --> 20:32.966
You are a legend.

20:33.091 --> 20:35.151
You gotta come out with us
again tonight!

20:35.276 --> 20:36.333
Sorry, boys.

20:36.458 --> 20:38.408
I've got better places to be.

20:41.104 --> 20:42.387
<i>Now, there it is.</i>

20:42.512 --> 20:45.243
<i>That's how you start a weedwhacker
in one pull.</i>

20:46.318 --> 20:48.254
- How's the meatloaf?
- Perfect.

20:48.379 --> 20:49.581
Everything's perfect.

20:49.939 --> 20:53.589
<i>It's time for you to call Bernie
with your gardening questions.</i>

20:53.740 --> 20:55.869
<i>Hello? Line one,
you're on with Bernie.</i>

20:55.994 --> 20:58.051
<i>You son of a bitch,
I'm gonna kill you.</i>

20:58.424 --> 20:59.844
I'm gonna finish this meatloaf,

20:59.969 --> 21:02.552
get on a plane to Toronto,
and shoot you in your lying face!
