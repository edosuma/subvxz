WEBVTT

00:01.130 --> 00:03.765
Previously on Legend of the Seeker...

00:03.939 --> 00:06.073
<i>A tear in the veil that separates
the Underworld</i>

00:06.074 --> 00:08.342
<i>from the world of the living.
</i> This happened when I killed Rahl.

00:08.343 --> 00:11.145
The only way to close the rift is the way
the Creator sealed the Underworld.

00:11.146 --> 00:12.780
The Stone of Tears. We'll find it.

00:12.781 --> 00:14.148
<i>He is a True Listener.</i>

00:14.149 --> 00:15.883
<i>Can see what people are thinking?</i>

00:15.884 --> 00:18.752
<i>An ancient scroll instructs
the bearer</i>

00:18.753 --> 00:21.422
<i>of the Stone of Tears how to use it.</i>

00:21.423 --> 00:23.290
<i>Kahlan, she has the scroll!</i>

00:23.291 --> 00:24.425
If you do as I ask,

00:24.426 --> 00:26.393
I will hand you the
scroll personally.

00:26.394 --> 00:28.362
<i>Suddenly you want to defeat the Keeper?</i>

00:28.363 --> 00:29.797
<i>I want to live again.</i>

00:29.798 --> 00:32.299
<i>I think you'll find it interesting
reading.</i>

00:32.299 --> 00:33.334
I know I did.

00:33.335 --> 00:35.235
<i>The instructions inscribed</i>

00:35.236 --> 00:38.172
will only appear in the
glow cast by a Night Wisp.

00:38.173 --> 00:39.907
<i>Well, I guess we know which way
we're headed.</i>

00:39.908 --> 00:41.342
<i>So does Rahl.</i>

00:41.343 --> 00:46.146
<i>Richard Cypher, you are the
true Seeker.</i>

<i>Why do you run from me,
Darken Rahl?</i>

01:22.350 --> 01:24.118
Not from you, master.

01:24.119 --> 01:25.653
For you.

01:25.654 --> 01:28.322
<i>You belong in the Underworld</i>
<i>at my side.</i>

01:28.323 --> 01:31.525
Master, I only returned
to the land of the living

01:31.526 --> 01:33.661
to learn something of
the greatest importance.

01:33.662 --> 01:37.731
Something that will help
us defeat the Seeker.

01:37.732 --> 01:40.634
<i>And what is it that you learned?</i>

01:40.635 --> 01:43.671
The Scroll of Valdaire,
now in the Seeker's possession,

01:43.672 --> 01:45.839
can only be read by the
light of a Night Wisp.

01:45.840 --> 01:47.675
This is why I have remained.

01:47.676 --> 01:50.310
To destroy the creatures.

01:50.311 --> 01:52.913
Once I've eradicated
all the Night Wisps,

01:52.914 --> 01:55.482
Richard Cypher will have no
means of reading the scroll.

01:55.483 --> 01:57.351
And without the knowledge
contained within it,

01:57.352 --> 02:00.654
even if he should find
the Stone of Tears,

02:00.655 --> 02:03.757
he will not be able to use it
to seal the tear in the veil.

02:03.758 --> 02:06.727
The land of the living
will be destroyed

02:06.728 --> 02:09.329
and your victory will be complete.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.365
<i>Very well, Darken Rahl,</i>

02:11.366 --> 02:13.701
<i>but as soon as the Night Wisps</i>
<i>are annihilated,</i>

02:13.702 --> 02:15.669
<i>you will kill yourself</i>
<i>and return to me.</i>

02:15.670 --> 02:18.605
As you wish, master.

02:18.606 --> 02:21.575
<i>If you do not, I will know</i>
<i>you have betrayed me.</i>

02:21.576 --> 02:24.812
<i>You will be hunted</i>
<i>down and ripped</i>

02:24.813 --> 02:27.548
<i>from the world of life to suffer
eternal torment</i>

02:27.549 --> 02:28.916
<i>in the depths of the Underworld.</i>

02:36.758 --> 02:37.925
A nightmare, My Lord?

02:37.926 --> 02:39.727
No.

02:39.728 --> 02:40.828
A warning.

02:42.697 --> 02:45.999
It's still hours till first light.

02:47.602 --> 02:49.803
Perhaps you could sleep better if

02:49.804 --> 02:52.339
I eased your mind.

02:54.609 --> 02:56.977
We've already wasted enough time.

02:59.380 --> 03:00.714
Where are we going, My Lord?

03:00.715 --> 03:02.916
Not "we."

03:02.917 --> 03:05.319
If my plan goes as anticipated,

03:05.320 --> 03:09.156
I need you to perform another task.

03:18.066 --> 03:22.970
Tell me your name, so I can have
it carved on your headstone.

03:24.572 --> 03:27.741
I am your master, Darken Rahl.

03:27.742 --> 03:29.510
And the time for games is over.

03:29.511 --> 03:32.012
Darken Rahl is dead.

03:32.013 --> 03:33.847
He was killed by the
Seeker months ago.

03:33.848 --> 03:37.985
It's not my death you
should be concerned about.

03:47.095 --> 03:49.463
Gather the rest of your squad.

03:49.464 --> 03:52.099
I have a mission for you.

03:52.100 --> 03:54.201
You know, we've been
traveling for two days

03:54.202 --> 03:55.669
without rest or food.

03:55.670 --> 03:58.238
I don't know how much longer
Zedd can keep this up.

03:58.239 --> 04:00.474
My ears work better than my legs.

04:00.475 --> 04:03.010
I appreciate your concern,
but I'll be fine.

04:03.011 --> 04:04.912
We're almost there.
The Forest of the Night Wisps

04:04.913 --> 04:08.015
is just beyond that next rise.

04:10.718 --> 04:12.586
It's snow.

04:18.692 --> 04:20.427
It's not snow.

04:20.428 --> 04:21.962
It's ash.

04:21.963 --> 04:22.896
Kahlan!

04:31.372 --> 04:33.473
The Night Wisps.

05:36.704 --> 05:39.606
They're all dead.

05:39.607 --> 05:41.375
Maybe some of them escaped.

05:41.376 --> 05:44.611
Even if they did,
where would they go?

05:44.612 --> 05:48.081
Kahlan, if there's another
Night Wisp alive in the world,

05:48.082 --> 05:49.283
we'll find it.

05:49.284 --> 05:51.118
Good thing we don't have
anything else to do,

05:51.119 --> 05:52.986
like find the Stone of Tears.

05:52.987 --> 05:56.323
Without the scroll, we won't
know what to do with the Stone.

05:56.324 --> 05:57.557
It'll be useless.

06:00.962 --> 06:02.462
Shh.

06:02.463 --> 06:03.830
Quiet. Did you hear that?

06:05.767 --> 06:07.234
One must have survived.

06:08.436 --> 06:10.203
Careful.

06:10.204 --> 06:12.806
Don't scare it off.

06:26.020 --> 06:29.589
Are you looking for this?

06:38.333 --> 06:40.567
Give me the Scroll of Valdaire...

06:42.270 --> 06:46.773
or the last Night Wisp dies.

06:52.174 --> 06:54.141
I wonder if you can throw
a Wizard's web faster

06:54.142 --> 06:56.877
than I can crush my
little friend here.

06:57.994 --> 06:59.962
They're very delicate, you know.

06:59.963 --> 07:02.364
Zedd.

07:02.365 --> 07:03.666
What do you want with the scroll?

07:03.667 --> 07:05.935
The same as you, dear brother.

07:05.936 --> 07:07.169
To save the world.

07:07.170 --> 07:10.172
I've already betrayed
the Keeper to do so.

07:10.173 --> 07:12.908
He expected me to annihilate
every last Night Wisp

07:12.909 --> 07:15.644
and then return to the Underworld.

07:15.645 --> 07:17.980
But I have no intention
of going back.

07:19.216 --> 07:21.684
I'm going to join your little quest

07:21.685 --> 07:24.553
and when you find
the Stone of Tears,

07:24.554 --> 07:25.855
you will give it to me,

07:25.856 --> 07:28.824
and I will follow the
instructions on the scroll

07:28.825 --> 07:30.593
and heal the rift.

07:30.594 --> 07:34.230
So you can be hailed
as the world's savior.

07:34.231 --> 07:36.565
Yes.

07:36.566 --> 07:38.300
The Keeper is impatient.

07:38.301 --> 07:41.070
He wants the world of life
snuffed out, and quickly.

07:41.071 --> 07:43.172
Which is why you must
give me the scroll now

07:43.173 --> 07:44.773
so I can prevent
that from happening.

07:44.774 --> 07:47.943
Don't you realize you've
already doomed the world

07:47.944 --> 07:49.778
by destroying the Night Wisps?

07:49.779 --> 07:52.047
Do you really think
I'm so short-sighted?

07:52.048 --> 07:54.984
The Night Wisps are the most
vital link in the chain of life.

07:54.985 --> 07:58.888
Their demise would bring
about a cascade of extinction

07:58.889 --> 08:00.923
that would eventually
result in the death

08:00.924 --> 08:04.293
of everything that
lives and breathes.

08:04.294 --> 08:08.964
Which is why I saved
this particular Wisp.

08:08.965 --> 08:10.132
It's with young.

08:10.133 --> 08:14.537
It can give birth
and life can go on,

08:14.538 --> 08:17.907
if you honor my simple request,

08:17.908 --> 08:19.975
and give me the scroll.

08:19.976 --> 08:23.779
Let him crush it.
We'll find another one.

08:23.780 --> 08:25.314
That's my Mord-Sith.

08:25.315 --> 08:28.651
No sentimental attachment.

08:28.652 --> 08:30.819
But if I know my brother,

08:30.820 --> 08:33.923
he's not willing to risk
the fate of the world

08:33.924 --> 08:35.991
on such a slim chance.

08:35.991 --> 08:37.760
What do you say?

08:37.760 --> 08:39.128
Since we're on the same side now,

08:39.129 --> 08:40.328
we may as well be partners.

08:40.330 --> 08:42.464
How do I know you won't
kill the Night Wisp

08:42.465 --> 08:44.533
as soon as I hand you the scroll?

08:44.534 --> 08:47.169
Well, you can be certain that
I will kill it if you do not.

08:51.708 --> 08:54.243
She's awfully quiet.

09:11.695 --> 09:16.298
Now, it seems that I
am the only living soul

09:16.299 --> 09:20.603
who knows what to do
with the Stone of Tears.

09:28.612 --> 09:30.112
No!

09:31.615 --> 09:33.182
Now, is that any way
to treat the newest

09:33.183 --> 09:34.984
member of your merry band?

09:34.985 --> 09:36.986
Relax, brother.

09:36.987 --> 09:39.688
I have the knowledge,
you have the compass.

09:39.689 --> 09:42.992
Together let's save the world.

09:47.864 --> 09:51.133
Now, let's find that Stone.

09:51.134 --> 09:53.435
The Night Wisps only give birth

09:53.436 --> 09:55.471
in the grottoes of the
northern foothills.

09:55.472 --> 09:58.307
If I don't take her there,
she and her babies will die.

09:58.308 --> 10:00.776
You'll have to go
through Gar territory.

10:00.777 --> 10:02.111
Cara, go with her.

10:02.112 --> 10:04.880
The compass is taking us northeast.

10:04.881 --> 10:07.349
We'll travel together
as far as Elmswood Pass.

10:07.350 --> 10:10.486
Then you and Kahlan will take
the Night Wisp to the grottoes.

10:10.487 --> 10:13.822
We'll continue on our
search for the Stone.

10:13.823 --> 10:15.658
Bind him.

10:15.659 --> 10:19.595
I want the "newest member ofur
merry band" on a short leash.

10:27.003 --> 10:29.104
What if the Prophecy
is coming true?

10:29.105 --> 10:30.406
What do you mean?

10:30.407 --> 10:32.608
"Should the son of Brennidon
seek the sacred stone,

10:32.609 --> 10:36.645
he will find it, only to deliver
it to the enemy of the light."

10:36.646 --> 10:38.080
What if Rahl is the
enemy of the light?

10:40.950 --> 10:42.584
I'm not going to
give him the Stone.

10:42.585 --> 10:43.886
Then how?

10:45.355 --> 10:47.423
I have an idea.

10:49.693 --> 10:53.162
I can't help but notice the
Wizard has disappeared.

10:53.163 --> 10:54.496
How disappointing.

10:54.497 --> 10:56.999
I was looking forward to
enjoying his renowned wit.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.535
Well, you'll have
to settle for mine.

10:59.536 --> 11:02.371
I know it must be very
frustrating for you, brother.

11:02.372 --> 11:04.473
I wonder how you're
planning to do it.

11:04.474 --> 11:05.607
Do what?

11:05.608 --> 11:07.843
Learn the instructions
on the scroll.

11:07.844 --> 11:10.913
Let's see, if I were you,
what would I do?

11:10.914 --> 11:12.614
Well, you can't confess me,

11:12.615 --> 11:14.283
you know my soul is
immune to Confession,

11:14.284 --> 11:16.819
and if you thought
Cara could break me,

11:16.820 --> 11:18.487
you would have had her
torture me by now.

11:18.488 --> 11:21.457
Oh, wait, I just
thought of something.

11:21.458 --> 11:24.393
Perhaps you sent the
Wizard to get a Listener

11:24.394 --> 11:26.495
to read my thoughts.

11:29.366 --> 11:30.399
We're here.

11:30.400 --> 11:32.668
This is Elmswood Pass.

11:41.911 --> 11:44.046
I guess this is where
we say goodbye.

11:45.281 --> 11:46.915
Can we speed this up?

11:46.916 --> 11:48.450
She loves you, you love her,

11:48.451 --> 11:50.786
I should protect her
as if she were you.

11:50.787 --> 11:52.054
Have I missed anything?

11:53.423 --> 11:54.890
We could be halfway
there by the time

11:54.891 --> 11:56.425
you two finish your goodbyes.

12:00.130 --> 12:02.698
We'll catch up once the
Night Wisp is safe.

12:02.699 --> 12:03.899
Be careful.

12:06.169 --> 12:08.103
You too.

12:16.546 --> 12:20.983
It must be difficult being
so close to the Confessor,

12:20.984 --> 12:23.886
but unable to bed her.

12:23.887 --> 12:28.657
No wonder you invited Cara
along on your little quest.

12:28.658 --> 12:30.793
The Mord-Sith have a long history

12:30.794 --> 12:33.429
of serving the House of Rahl

12:33.430 --> 12:35.063
in every way.

12:35.064 --> 12:37.666
And as I recall,

12:37.667 --> 12:41.003
Cara was always so eager to please.
Careful, brother.

12:41.004 --> 12:42.471
You wouldn't want to do anything

12:42.472 --> 12:44.039
that may cause me
to lose my memory.

12:46.910 --> 12:48.043
You're right.

12:54.617 --> 12:58.086
Keeper, hear our prayer.

12:58.087 --> 13:00.756
We live only to serve you.

13:00.757 --> 13:02.758
For it is you who will take us--

13:14.938 --> 13:18.574
<i>Sister Marianna.</i>

13:18.575 --> 13:19.842
Keeper...

13:21.811 --> 13:23.879
you've heard our prayers.

13:23.880 --> 13:26.949
<i>The prayers of foolish girls</i>
<i>do not concern me.</i>

13:26.950 --> 13:29.017
Master, why are you angry?

13:29.018 --> 13:31.053
We are your loyal servants.

13:31.054 --> 13:35.457
<i>My most loyal servant of all, Darken Rahl,
has betrayed me.</i>

13:35.458 --> 13:37.593
How can that be?

13:37.594 --> 13:40.095
<i>He was to destroy the Night Wisps,</i>

13:40.096 --> 13:43.632
<i>then kill himself and return</i>
<i>to the Underworld.</i>

13:43.633 --> 13:46.301
<i>I've received the souls of thousands
of Night Wisps,</i>

13:46.302 --> 13:49.671
<i>but Rahl's soul did not follow.</i>

13:49.672 --> 13:51.540
What do you ask of us?

13:51.541 --> 13:56.411
<i>Find him wherever he is and
send him back to me.</i>

13:56.412 --> 14:00.916
How I have missed the
simple pleasures of life.

14:00.917 --> 14:02.451
Enjoy them while you can.

14:02.452 --> 14:06.388
Someday, whether it's
in a week or 50 years,

14:06.389 --> 14:10.125
you'll be dead again and you'll
have to face the Keeper's wrath.

14:10.126 --> 14:11.894
Oh, you're mistaken.

14:11.895 --> 14:13.395
When the veil is repaired

14:13.396 --> 14:15.597
and the natural order of
the Underworld restored,

14:15.598 --> 14:18.033
I will bask in the Creator's light

14:18.034 --> 14:20.702
along with you and
the Mother Confessor.

14:20.703 --> 14:23.138
You've killed countless
innocent people.

14:23.139 --> 14:24.706
How could you possibly believe

14:24.707 --> 14:26.742
the Creator is going to reward you?

14:26.743 --> 14:28.477
When I seal the rift,

14:28.478 --> 14:30.612
not only will I be
protecting those alive today,

14:30.613 --> 14:33.882
I'll be ensuring the lives
of future generations.

14:33.883 --> 14:35.717
Surely, such a noble act

14:35.718 --> 14:38.120
will tip the scale
of deeds in my favor.

14:38.121 --> 14:43.058
The only reason you want to save
the world is to save yourself.

14:43.059 --> 14:47.162
Well, you've had quite a
run at being the hero.

14:47.163 --> 14:49.498
Isn't it time you shared the
glory with someone else?

15:29.973 --> 15:31.673
I told you I'm on your side.

16:07.276 --> 16:09.611
I always knew we'd make
a great team, brother.

16:24.808 --> 16:26.742
Welcome, Wizard.

16:26.743 --> 16:28.110
What brings you to Thandor?

16:28.111 --> 16:31.180
I've come to see an old friend.

16:32.449 --> 16:33.916
Zedd!

16:33.917 --> 16:37.419
Look how big you've
grown in just a year.

16:37.420 --> 16:39.321
You're almost as tall as I am.

16:39.322 --> 16:41.257
No one's as tall as you.

16:42.659 --> 16:44.526
What's this?

16:44.527 --> 16:49.031
The Sisters of the Light have
you wearing a Rada'han now?

16:49.032 --> 16:50.599
Suppressing his
ability to read minds

16:50.600 --> 16:52.835
gives him a chance at
a normal childhood.

16:52.836 --> 16:54.136
Renn's come a long way

16:54.137 --> 16:57.206
since you entrusted him
to our care, Wizard.

16:57.207 --> 16:58.607
I'm glad to hear it.

16:58.608 --> 17:00.676
I would never ask to
take him away from you

17:00.677 --> 17:02.978
unless it was a matter
of great urgency.

17:02.979 --> 17:07.148
You want him to help the Seeker.

17:07.150 --> 17:08.284
Yes.

17:08.285 --> 17:10.519
You know the Sisters of the Light

17:10.520 --> 17:14.455
believe the Seeker is
prophesied to help the Keeper.

17:14.457 --> 17:17.026
I can't allow Renn to go with you.

17:17.027 --> 17:18.928
The Seeker saved me.

17:18.929 --> 17:20.996
I want to help him if I can.

17:20.997 --> 17:24.098
I think the boy's wishes are clear.

17:26.569 --> 17:28.137
Very well.

17:28.137 --> 17:31.473
I'll get the key to the Rada'han.

17:31.474 --> 17:33.776
Where are we going?

17:38.348 --> 17:41.250
Renn, I need you to listen closely.

17:41.251 --> 17:43.052
The Sisters aren't going to let me

17:43.053 --> 17:45.220
take you out of here
without a fight.

17:45.221 --> 17:47.256
I don't understand.

17:47.257 --> 17:48.924
Sister Everleen--

17:48.925 --> 17:52.528
She's coming back,
but not with a key.

17:52.529 --> 17:55.230
What do you want me to do?

17:55.231 --> 17:57.833
On my word, stay low.

18:01.204 --> 18:02.571
Ready?

18:03.907 --> 18:05.841
Now!

18:11.815 --> 18:14.216
I'll take that key now.

18:16.720 --> 18:19.888
I know how lonely it can be.

18:19.889 --> 18:22.324
My sister and I are
the last of our kind.

18:23.426 --> 18:26.428
When we find the Stone of Tears,

18:26.429 --> 18:27.796
and the world is safe,

18:27.797 --> 18:29.198
I'd love to have a baby,

18:29.199 --> 18:33.135
but for me it's complicated.

18:33.136 --> 18:34.770
Yes,

18:34.771 --> 18:38.440
because my heart
belongs to Richard.

18:38.441 --> 18:40.275
If I were to take him as my mate,

18:40.276 --> 18:42.811
my magic would destroy him.

18:45.515 --> 18:47.249
Well, when you put it like that,

18:47.250 --> 18:49.651
I guess it would be
easier to be a Night Wisp.

18:49.652 --> 18:53.655
Can you please stop
that incessant babbling?

18:53.656 --> 18:57.159
Night Wisps are the
most fragile beings

18:57.160 --> 18:58.460
the Creator has ever made.

18:58.461 --> 19:02.898
Without constant companionship
they will perish.

19:02.899 --> 19:05.567
So if you give me
one moment of peace

19:05.568 --> 19:07.336
that thing's going to die?

19:07.337 --> 19:10.672
It might.

19:10.673 --> 19:14.977
I don't even know if my talking
to her is going to be enough.

19:14.978 --> 19:16.912
She's so delicate.

19:16.913 --> 19:19.114
Not only is she with young,

19:19.115 --> 19:20.849
but she's lost her entire family.

19:22.819 --> 19:24.787
She would be a lot
stronger if she had them

19:24.788 --> 19:26.488
to accompany her to
the birthing ground.

19:26.489 --> 19:28.824
How do you even know
what it's saying?

19:31.428 --> 19:33.162
It'a magical language.

19:33.163 --> 19:35.130
If you listen closely,

19:35.131 --> 19:37.900
eventually you'll understand it.

19:42.238 --> 19:44.273
It's a bit ironic, isn't it?

19:44.274 --> 19:45.574
The man who killed me

19:45.575 --> 19:47.443
going to such lengths
to keep me alive.

19:47.444 --> 19:49.511
The cut isn't deep. It'll heal.

19:49.512 --> 19:53.615
Your brotherly
affection is touching.

19:53.616 --> 19:56.518
Who do you think you're
fooling with this ruse?

19:56.519 --> 19:59.688
You're always so quick to think
the worst of me, brother.

19:59.689 --> 20:02.858
You had the man who
raised me murdered.

20:02.859 --> 20:06.695
And now you've nearly destroyed
an entire race of creatures,

20:06.696 --> 20:09.264
all so you could get the
glory for saving the world.

20:10.934 --> 20:13.135
And you wonder why
I think the worst?

20:13.136 --> 20:16.472
You're right, of course.

20:16.473 --> 20:20.075
But I assure you,
my sentiment was genuine.

20:20.076 --> 20:22.611
It is nice being in the
company of one's family.

20:22.612 --> 20:24.680
Is that why you murdered
your own father?

20:24.681 --> 20:26.148
You have no idea what it was like

20:26.149 --> 20:28.217
growing up in the House of Rahl.

20:28.218 --> 20:29.451
For most people

20:29.452 --> 20:31.653
it is a joy to learn
you're to have a sibling,

20:31.654 --> 20:35.023
but imagine how I felt when
our father boasted to me

20:35.024 --> 20:39.795
that my own baby brother
would be the one to kill me.

20:39.796 --> 20:42.331
<i>We were unable to kill him, master.</i>

20:42.332 --> 20:44.900
<i>Darken Rahl is one man.</i>

20:44.901 --> 20:47.903
<i>In the body he has now,
he possesses no magic.</i>

20:47.904 --> 20:50.606
<i>And yet you allowed him to slip</i>
<i>through your fingers?</i>

20:50.607 --> 20:52.608
Master, he was not alone.

20:52.609 --> 20:54.042
The Seeker was with him.

20:54.043 --> 20:55.444
<i>The Seeker?</i>

20:55.445 --> 20:58.413
If not for him, Darken Rahl
would be groveling before you

20:58.414 --> 21:00.649
in the Underworld
at this very moment.

21:00.650 --> 21:02.484
<i>This is quite unexpected.</i>

21:02.485 --> 21:04.786
<i>And quite fortunate.</i>

21:04.787 --> 21:05.988
Master?

21:05.989 --> 21:07.489
<i>Now that the brothers are together,</i>

21:07.490 --> 21:09.491
<i>I can destroy them both.</i>

21:09.492 --> 21:13.295
We thought the Seeker was
more valuable alive than dead.

21:13.296 --> 21:15.397
Prophecy says he will
deliver the Stone

21:15.398 --> 21:16.932
to the enemy of the light.

21:16.933 --> 21:19.001
<i>That "enemy of the light" could
be his own brother,</i>

21:19.002 --> 21:21.170
<i>Darken Rahl,</i>

21:21.171 --> 21:24.206
<i>whom I can no longer trust</i>
<i>to do my will.</i>

21:24.207 --> 21:26.308
They can't have gotten far.

21:26.309 --> 21:27.709
We'll leave immediately.

21:27.710 --> 21:30.546
<i>No. You have already failed me once.</i>

21:30.547 --> 21:34.016
<i>This task will require someone</i>
<i>much more powerful than you.</i>

21:34.017 --> 21:36.818
<i>A man of extraordinary strength,</i>

21:36.819 --> 21:40.522
<i>and with an uncommon disregard
for life.</i>

21:49.332 --> 21:51.433
Faster, you dogs!

22:08.251 --> 22:10.552
Don't kill me.

22:10.553 --> 22:12.287
As you wish.

22:12.288 --> 22:14.623
We'll let him do it.

22:29.339 --> 22:31.073
Who are you?

22:31.074 --> 22:32.941
Servants of the Keeper.

22:32.942 --> 22:35.244
And what does the
Keeper want with me?

22:35.245 --> 22:39.114
You've earned his favor with
the thousands you've killed.

22:39.115 --> 22:42.751
And now he has a task for you.

22:55.898 --> 22:57.032
What is it?

22:57.033 --> 23:00.269
We've crossed into Gar territory.

23:00.270 --> 23:02.037
Get your Agiels ready.

23:05.842 --> 23:09.444
Why do Gars bother to feed
on something so small?

23:09.445 --> 23:11.380
They absorb the Night Wisps' han.

23:11.381 --> 23:13.849
It allows them to hunt in the dark.

23:18.021 --> 23:19.354
Quick, in here.

23:29.799 --> 23:31.333
It knows we're here.

24:24.098 --> 24:27.234
You want this?

24:39.347 --> 24:43.584
I can't understand a
single thing you're saying.

24:43.585 --> 24:46.086
I'm sorry Kahlan's not
here to talk to you,

24:46.087 --> 24:47.888
but she had to draw the Gars away,

24:47.889 --> 24:50.791
so would you please stop serenading

24:50.792 --> 24:54.194
every creature in the forest?

24:57.265 --> 24:59.066
Finally.

25:04.138 --> 25:05.839
Let's keep moving.

25:08.943 --> 25:10.644
What's wrong?

25:11.980 --> 25:16.917
The dacra's magic must
have tainted my blood.

25:25.293 --> 25:26.827
Zedd will be back soon.
He'll heal you.

25:28.830 --> 25:30.163
How is that funny?

25:30.164 --> 25:32.232
Before our encounter

25:32.233 --> 25:34.434
in the Forest of the Night Wisps,

25:34.435 --> 25:38.171
I knew you wouldn't be content
to let the secrets of the scroll

25:38.172 --> 25:40.774
remain locked in my
mind so I planned ahead.

25:40.775 --> 25:42.876
What did you do?

25:42.877 --> 25:48.849
In case you sent your
Wizard to find a Listener,

25:48.850 --> 25:51.018
I ordered my Mord-Sith
to track him.

25:51.019 --> 25:53.887
Once Zedd's found a Listener,

25:53.888 --> 25:56.289
Garen will kill them both.

25:56.290 --> 25:58.659
Apparently,
I've sealed my own fate,

25:58.660 --> 26:01.762
as well as the fate of the world.

26:07.201 --> 26:09.336
Oh, Renn.

26:09.337 --> 26:11.872
Enjoy youth while it lasts.

26:11.873 --> 26:14.174
Before you know it,
time sneaks up on you

26:14.175 --> 26:18.745
and you have aches in places you
didn't even know you had places.

26:18.746 --> 26:21.415
Do an old man a favor.

26:21.416 --> 26:25.285
Pass me that long
branch over there.

26:25.286 --> 26:28.755
It'll make a nice walking stick.

26:31.159 --> 26:33.360
I would think a Wizard of
the First Order would know

26:33.361 --> 26:35.095
he can't use magic on a Mord-Sith.

26:37.031 --> 26:38.699
I have no intention of using magic.

26:48.910 --> 26:50.744
You're going to need
more than a walking cane

26:50.745 --> 26:52.245
to defeat me, old man.

27:11.899 --> 27:14.601
Well, Wisp, it's just you and me,

27:14.602 --> 27:17.804
and we have a long way to go, so...

27:19.607 --> 27:21.675
what do you want to talk about?

27:21.676 --> 27:24.578
Huh?

27:24.579 --> 27:26.847
Mm.

27:28.683 --> 27:31.151
This would be so much
easier if you used words

27:31.152 --> 27:33.120
instead of chirping.

27:34.722 --> 27:38.558
I'll bet you wish Kahlan
was here instead of me.

27:38.559 --> 27:42.596
The truth is,
you're lucky I'm here.

27:42.597 --> 27:44.331
Kahlan couldn't have run all night

27:44.332 --> 27:48.235
and got you safely out of
Gar territory like I did.

27:48.236 --> 27:54.107
I'm faster than she is and
I have more endurance.

27:54.108 --> 27:56.209
I'm also better in a fight.

27:56.210 --> 27:59.212
If it weren't for me,
everyone on this quest

27:59.213 --> 28:01.114
would be Shadrin food by now.

28:02.984 --> 28:04.417
I'm not boasting.

28:04.418 --> 28:06.520
I'm simply--

28:08.623 --> 28:10.490
Wait.

28:11.959 --> 28:13.660
Did you just say I was boasting?

28:18.866 --> 28:21.601
I can understand you.

28:21.602 --> 28:23.170
Say something else.

28:25.339 --> 28:27.107
Kahlan is close?

28:27.108 --> 28:28.542
Where?

28:39.654 --> 28:41.488
Did you throw the
Gars off our tracks?

28:41.489 --> 28:44.191
Yes, but I twisted my ankle.

28:44.192 --> 28:46.226
Don't worry. She'll live.

28:48.062 --> 28:49.529
You can understand her.

28:49.530 --> 28:50.997
It wasn't that hard,

28:50.998 --> 28:52.499
once it started speaking clearly.

28:53.968 --> 28:55.235
Here, you take her.

29:01.943 --> 29:06.112
Cara, her light is getting weaker.

29:06.113 --> 29:07.881
We don't have much time.

29:07.882 --> 29:10.851
With my ankle I won't be
able to move fast enough.

29:12.320 --> 29:14.187
It's up to you to get her
to the birthing ground.

29:20.461 --> 29:22.963
For years you faithfully
served Darken Rahl

29:22.964 --> 29:24.764
as leader of the Dragon Corps.

29:24.765 --> 29:27.300
Half the Midlands was
conquered under my command.

29:27.301 --> 29:28.535
And how did Rahl

29:28.536 --> 29:30.670
reward such fealty?

29:30.671 --> 29:34.207
He had me thrown into the
Prison Mines of Mearog

29:34.208 --> 29:35.909
when he feared his men

29:35.910 --> 29:38.478
were growing more
loyal to me than him.

29:38.479 --> 29:40.213
You've suffered for so long,

29:40.214 --> 29:43.717
but now the Keeper offers you
a chance to kill Darken Rahl

29:43.718 --> 29:46.887
and take the revenge
that has eluded you.

29:46.888 --> 29:49.789
And what does the
Keeper ask in return?

29:51.325 --> 29:52.959
He wants you to
sacrifice your arm...

29:55.663 --> 29:58.231
so that he can give you his.

30:00.334 --> 30:05.505
But you must be willing to
pay the price for such power.

30:16.617 --> 30:19.920
Make me an instrument
of the Keeper.

30:43.549 --> 30:44.783
You're wrong.

30:44.784 --> 30:47.318
They don't care for me,
they only value me

30:47.319 --> 30:51.623
because...I'm effective.

30:51.624 --> 30:53.892
Richard only keeps me
because he needs me.

30:53.893 --> 30:56.961
Kahlan puts up with
me because of Richard.

30:56.962 --> 30:59.731
And Zedd...

30:59.732 --> 31:02.634
Zedd would probably torch me
with Wizard's Fire if he could.

31:05.538 --> 31:07.338
That's absurd.

31:07.339 --> 31:10.642
I'm not afraid of
getting close to them.

31:10.643 --> 31:11.810
I do not love them.

31:14.146 --> 31:16.414
I don't.

31:16.415 --> 31:19.083
I am not afraid to say it.

31:20.553 --> 31:23.087
Mord-Sith are afraid of nothing.

31:23.088 --> 31:26.057
Stop nagging.

31:26.058 --> 31:27.859
You remind me of Kahlan.

31:27.860 --> 31:30.929
All right.

31:30.930 --> 31:34.499
I love Richard.

31:34.500 --> 31:38.303
It's a Mord-Sith's duty
to love the Lord Rahl.

31:39.672 --> 31:43.208
What does it matter how I
feel about Zedd and Kahlan?

31:45.611 --> 31:48.947
Fine. I care for them too.

31:48.948 --> 31:52.283
A little. There.

31:52.284 --> 31:54.886
I said it.

31:54.887 --> 31:56.988
Are you happy now?

31:56.989 --> 32:00.592
Wisp?

32:00.593 --> 32:02.427
Wisp?

32:08.033 --> 32:11.069
What's wrong?

32:11.070 --> 32:13.938
What do you mean you're dying?

32:15.875 --> 32:19.844
You used all your strength
to save your babies.

32:22.381 --> 32:26.484
Hold on, Wisp, I'm going to get
you to the birthing ground.

32:31.123 --> 32:34.826
This is useless. We will
never find a healer in time.

32:34.827 --> 32:37.795
Are you telling me the greatest
tyrant the world has ever known

32:37.796 --> 32:40.031
is going to be done in by
a scratch from a dacra?

32:40.032 --> 32:42.433
It's tragic, isn't it?

32:42.434 --> 32:43.468
Don't give up!

32:43.469 --> 32:46.104
I am not going to make it.

32:49.508 --> 32:54.178
Then, before you die, tell me
what was written on the scroll.

32:54.179 --> 32:55.813
No.

32:55.814 --> 32:58.983
You want to save the world?
This is your chance.

32:58.984 --> 33:02.020
When I die,
the Keeper has assured me

33:02.021 --> 33:05.690
I will suffer eternal torment,

33:05.691 --> 33:08.393
but if I can tell him

33:08.394 --> 33:10.161
that I didn't reveal
the scroll's secrets,

33:10.162 --> 33:12.997
perhaps I can escape that fate.

33:12.998 --> 33:15.600
And what makes you think the
Keeper will be merciful?

33:15.601 --> 33:17.402
Oh, a lifetime of service

33:17.403 --> 33:20.872
should forgive a
momentary transgression.

33:20.873 --> 33:22.607
Lifetime of service?

33:24.209 --> 33:27.045
What I'm about to tell you,

33:27.046 --> 33:30.648
I have never revealed
to a single living soul.

33:30.649 --> 33:34.619
At a young age I reached
the limits of my powers...

33:36.355 --> 33:37.956
but I wasn't satisfied.

33:39.592 --> 33:42.226
I discovered an ancient
volume which promised...

33:43.762 --> 33:47.465
to give me unlimited power,

33:47.466 --> 33:49.601
but at a terrible price.

33:49.602 --> 33:52.503
What are you talking about?

33:52.504 --> 33:55.206
When you killed me, dear Richard,

33:55.207 --> 33:58.142
it was not the first time I died.

34:01.647 --> 34:03.548
I followed the book's instructions,

34:03.549 --> 34:04.916
I took my own life.

34:04.917 --> 34:06.684
Once in thUnderworld,

34:06.685 --> 34:09.754
I communed with the Keeper
and I made him an offer.

34:09.755 --> 34:15.159
If he would grant me the
power to rule the world,

34:15.159 --> 34:17.128
each day I would kill for him.

34:17.129 --> 34:22.699
I would send him an
endless supply of souls.

34:22.701 --> 34:23.868
You were a baneling?

34:25.170 --> 34:27.304
The very first.

34:30.743 --> 34:35.246
All the death and destruction
you wrought was for the Keeper?

34:35.246 --> 34:38.516
Yes.

34:40.052 --> 34:43.721
But he deceived me.

34:43.722 --> 34:46.224
He only returned me to
the land of the living

34:46.225 --> 34:47.458
because he knew one day

34:47.458 --> 34:49.127
you could use the power
of Orden to kill me.

34:49.128 --> 34:52.463
And my death would tear a hole

34:52.464 --> 34:56.300
in the veil between the two worlds.

34:56.301 --> 34:59.170
It was all part of his plan.

34:59.171 --> 35:03.307
But you have a chance
to stop him. Now.

35:03.308 --> 35:06.978
I'll make sure that everyone
knows how you died heroically.

35:06.979 --> 35:10.181
That your last act
was saving the world.

35:10.182 --> 35:12.517
Just tell me what
was on the scroll.

35:18.490 --> 35:20.591
Richard...

35:24.196 --> 35:26.130
Behind you.

37:14.024 --> 37:15.591
Rahl!

37:15.592 --> 37:17.160
You can't die!

37:26.904 --> 37:29.372
We made it.

37:31.942 --> 37:34.277
Wisp?

37:35.646 --> 37:37.980
Wisp?

38:15.352 --> 38:18.421
I'm sorry I failed you.

38:48.152 --> 38:51.187
The babies survived.

38:58.629 --> 39:01.964
No! Come on!

39:01.965 --> 39:04.433
You have to hold on.
You have to fight!

39:06.470 --> 39:09.071
Richard.

39:09.072 --> 39:10.806
Zedd, hurry, he's dying!

39:46.977 --> 39:48.778
You don't know how happy I am

39:48.779 --> 39:51.781
to see that you
escaped death, Wizard.

39:51.782 --> 39:54.116
I wish I could say
the same for you.

39:56.653 --> 40:01.390
It seems I will get to
enjoy that wit after all.

40:07.598 --> 40:10.366
And you must be the Listener.

40:15.472 --> 40:17.206
You have to take the Stone of Tears

40:17.207 --> 40:18.608
to the Pillars of Creation,

40:18.609 --> 40:21.077
on the day of the summer solstice.

40:21.078 --> 40:23.045
That's less than a
fortnight from now.

40:23.046 --> 40:24.981
If we don't make it there
with the Stone by then,

40:24.982 --> 40:26.482
we'll have to wait another year.

40:26.483 --> 40:30.553
By that time,
the Keeper will have won.

40:30.554 --> 40:32.221
Does he know what we
have to do with the Stone

40:32.222 --> 40:33.155
once we get it there?

40:36.927 --> 40:39.462
You have to place it in
the center of the Pillars.

40:39.463 --> 40:44.800
The light of noonday sun
will pass through the Stone

40:44.801 --> 40:46.902
and repair the tear in the veil.

40:46.903 --> 40:49.839
Thank you, Renn.

40:49.840 --> 40:52.008
I was going to tell you.

40:53.143 --> 40:54.844
He might have.

40:54.845 --> 40:58.314
His mind is so full
of confusing thoughts,

40:58.315 --> 41:01.250
I can't tell for sure.

41:15.532 --> 41:17.733
Did you make it?

41:25.175 --> 41:26.575
I wish you could have been there.

41:31.214 --> 41:34.850
It was the most beautiful
thing I have ever seen.

41:44.027 --> 41:45.895
Now that we know what
to do with the Stone,

41:45.896 --> 41:47.697
we don't need Rahl anymore.

41:47.698 --> 41:49.231
We can't kill him.

41:49.232 --> 41:50.966
He'll tell the Keeper
where we're headed.

41:50.967 --> 41:52.234
What do you have in mind?

41:53.537 --> 41:55.204
We take him with us.

41:55.205 --> 41:58.140
He's not going  like
being our prisoner.

41:58.141 --> 42:00.209
I won't give him a choice.

42:00.210 --> 42:01.644
What about me?

42:01.645 --> 42:06.015
You don't think I should
go back to Thandor...

42:06.016 --> 42:09.852
No, but Kahlan has a
sister who loves children.

42:09.853 --> 42:13.622
How do you feel about
being an older brother?

42:16.393 --> 42:18.227
No!

42:31.508 --> 42:34.176
I'm sure I'll see you again,
brother.

42:34.177 --> 42:36.412
I'm sure you will.
