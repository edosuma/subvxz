10:46.063 --> 10:48.357
Well, I play the saxophone.

10:48.440 --> 10:49.858
-You don’t say.
-Yeah.

10:49.941 --> 10:52.527
I used to be
a saxophonist myself.

10:52.611 --> 10:54.196
-Is that right?
-Yeah.

10:54.279 --> 10:56.323
Hey, you ever hear
"The Scooty-Scooty Blues"?

10:56.406 --> 10:58.825
No, I don’t think
I know that one.

11:18.887 --> 11:20.806

11:20.889 --> 11:23.058

with a snakeskin case.

11:23.141 --> 11:25.644
-You still play?
-Nah, nah.

11:25.727 --> 11:28.438
Once I started a family,
I gave all that up.

11:28.522 --> 11:31.441
Nah, this record store
is my only tie to music now.

11:31.525 --> 11:34.152

but, you know, she...

make TV shows one day.

11:46.123 --> 11:47.749
Why? What you got going on?

11:47.833 --> 11:50.168
Well, Bobby took a day job
at the record store

11:50.252 --> 11:53.547
so he can put the make on
this babe, and she’s engaged.

11:53.630 --> 11:54.923

16:46.381 --> 16:49.217
A French light.

It’s when you light a cigarette
and it only lights up halfway.

16:52.345 --> 16:55.849

you’re gonna fall in love.

16:59.728 --> 17:01.563

17:09.821 --> 17:13.450
So Daddy tells me
you’re a saxophone player.

17:13.533 --> 17:14.951
Yep.

17:16.161 --> 17:17.495
I’m actually in town

17:17.579 --> 17:20.206
with my band from Detroit
for the summer.

17:20.290 --> 17:21.875
We’re playing
over at the Blue Morocco.

17:21.958 --> 17:24.753
-Are you any good?
-(chuckles softly)

17:24.836 --> 17:26.796
Depends on what you like.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.590
It’s not Bill Haley
and the Comets.

17:28.673 --> 17:31.509
(chuckles) Well, I like
all sorts of music.

17:31.593 --> 17:34.512
You have to, working in a
record store and all, you know.

17:34.596 --> 17:37.307
So you can suggest music
to the customers.

17:40.059 --> 17:44.314
For instance, you got
Monk’s "Brilliant Corners,"

17:44.397 --> 17:46.107
and you’re a saxophone player,

17:46.191 --> 17:49.277
so I’m guessing you like
Sonny Rollins.

17:49.360 --> 17:50.695
-Uh-huh.
-Am I right?

17:50.779 --> 17:52.530
Yeah.

17:52.614 --> 17:54.365
Well, then I would recommend

17:54.449 --> 17:55.950
his latest album,
"Way Out West,"

17:56.034 --> 17:58.119
where he leads a trio
with him on sax

17:58.203 --> 18:00.205
and a bassist and a drummer.

18:01.456 --> 18:03.958
Unless of course
you already have it.

18:04.042 --> 18:05.668

24:18.332 --> 24:19.750
(Sylvie laughs)

24:21.752 --> 24:23.880
So what’s the verdict?

24:23.963 --> 24:25.590
Am I any good?

24:27.383 --> 24:29.385
Well, you’re right,
you’re no Bill Haley.

24:31.387 --> 24:32.972
But I do think
you’re about as good

24:33.055 --> 24:35.099
as any tenor player
I’ve ever heard.

24:35.183 --> 24:38.561
With the exception of
John William Coltrane, but...

24:40.104 --> 24:41.772
I’d say you’re gaining on him.
(chuckles)

24:41.856 --> 24:44.609
I don’t think I’ll ever catch
the Trane, but thank you.

24:44.692 --> 24:46.360
Well, thank you for being good.

24:46.444 --> 24:48.112
I’d be awful embarrassed
if you weren’t.

24:48.196 --> 24:49.405
-(both chuckle)
-CONNIE: Hey, Bobby.

24:49.488 --> 24:51.490
We’re all going
around the corner to Freddie’s

24:51.574 --> 24:52.909
if you want to stop by.

24:52.992 --> 24:55.411
When you’re done babysitting.

24:59.832 --> 25:02.084
Is that your girlfriend?

25:02.168 --> 25:04.253
Uh, who, Connie? No.

25:04.337 --> 25:06.547
We just work together.

25:06.631 --> 25:09.550
Kind of like we do,
only she’s not engaged.

("Tears on My Pillow" by Little
Anthony & The Imperials plays)

25:16.724 --> 25:19.769
Well, I do think
I ought to be going home.

25:19.852 --> 25:21.479
Uh, before you do...

25:25.441 --> 25:28.569

Can I walk you?

26:35.553 --> 26:38.180
Did you listen
to "Brilliant Corners" yet?

26:38.264 --> 26:40.266
(chuckles softly)
Only about a hundred times.

26:40.349 --> 26:42.059
(Sylvie chuckles)

26:42.143 --> 26:45.021
I never met a girl who knew
as much about music as you do.

26:45.104 --> 26:47.023
I bet the only thing
you know about

26:47.106 --> 26:49.650
-more than music is television.
-Oh, don’t get me started.

26:49.734 --> 26:52.820
I’ve seen just about
every episode of everything.

26:52.903 --> 26:54.530
Well...

26:54.613 --> 26:58.117
I never met anyone who could
play music the way you do.

26:59.785 --> 27:03.122
What’s the one thing
you love about it the most?

27:03.205 --> 27:05.624
Mm, the way it makes me feel.

27:07.126 --> 27:09.628
Oh, that’s me.

27:09.712 --> 27:11.172
Yeah.

27:11.255 --> 27:13.841
Never found anything
to make me feel like that.

27:15.843 --> 27:18.262
So how’d you meet your fiancé?

27:18.346 --> 27:19.638
Oh.

27:19.722 --> 27:22.516
At a cotillion
at the Renaissance Ball.

27:22.600 --> 27:24.143
At a what?

27:24.226 --> 27:26.062
You don’t know
what a cotillion is?

27:26.145 --> 27:27.605
-No.
-(chuckles)

27:27.688 --> 27:30.149
Uh, it’s a formal ball

27:30.232 --> 27:32.985
where debutantes are
presented to society

27:33.069 --> 27:35.321
and then introduced to young
men from prominent families.

27:35.404 --> 27:36.989
-Oh.
-Mm.

27:37.073 --> 27:39.075
So Lacy’s from
a prominent family?

27:39.158 --> 27:41.035
Oh, sure.
His father’s a doctor,

27:41.118 --> 27:43.788
and he has one of the most
successful medical practices

27:43.871 --> 27:46.123
in the country,
Negro or otherwise.

27:46.207 --> 27:48.376

27:48.459 --> 27:50.086

Well, thank you for...

27:54.465 --> 27:56.425
walking me home.

27:58.260 --> 28:00.805

If last night
was such a mistake,

35:04.353 --> 35:05.646
why you so bent out of shape

about me dancing
with somebody else?

35:09.441 --> 35:10.901
Because...

35:12.653 --> 35:15.155
...mistake or not,

35:15.239 --> 35:18.158

she’d like to think that

that guy’s been kissing.

35:21.203 --> 35:22.454

35:22.538 --> 35:23.872

Well, the only reason
I was carrying on with her

35:25.958 --> 35:27.334
in the first place
is ’cause of you,

35:27.417 --> 35:28.877
telling me
this was all a big mistake.

35:28.961 --> 35:31.129
That doesn’t make me
feel very special either.

35:32.714 --> 35:35.259
Matter of fact, it made me
feel pretty ordinary.

35:37.845 --> 35:39.680
Well, you’re not.

35:40.931 --> 35:42.724
Ordinary, to me.

you’re one of the most...

only qualification.

1:04:11.348 --> 1:04:13.100
Oh, hey, Sid.

1:04:13.183 --> 1:04:15.519
You got any extra comps
for the show this Friday?

1:04:15.602 --> 1:04:17.271
Sure. How many you need?

1:04:17.354 --> 1:04:19.106
Just one.

1:04:19.189 --> 1:04:21.358
Send it to this address
please. Thanks.

1:04:25.612 --> 1:04:27.614
Now, of course, when you make
French onion soup,

1:04:27.698 --> 1:04:29.658
you’re going to need
an awful lot of onions.

1:04:29.741 --> 1:04:31.285
And if you’re prone
to tearing up,

1:04:31.368 --> 1:04:35.872
one trick is to keep
a bowl of salted water nearby.

1:04:35.956 --> 1:04:38.792
And speaking of salt,
let’s pause to welcome

1:04:38.875 --> 1:04:42.421

Lighthouse Salt.

What do you say we go out
to a fancy dinner Friday night,

1:06:15.013 --> 1:06:16.640

1:06:16.723 --> 1:06:18.308

And the guy goes out
to fix the flat,

but he’s got no gloves, see,
and he starts to get cold.

1:06:34.700 --> 1:06:36.827
He goes back to the car
to warm up.

put your hands between my legs?

1:06:39.705 --> 1:06:42.040

1:06:44.960 --> 1:06:46.461
He goes out to continue.

1:06:46.545 --> 1:06:48.463
He’s fixing the flat.
His hands get cold again.

1:06:48.547 --> 1:06:49.840
He goes back to the car, says,

1:06:49.923 --> 1:06:51.883
"Can I put my hands between
your legs and warm them up?"

1:06:51.967 --> 1:06:53.510

gonna get cold?"
