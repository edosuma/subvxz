03:45.083 --> 03:46.542
a wooden pony and used it

03:46.583 --> 03:48.417
as your getaway horse.

03:48.458 --> 03:49.709
I would have gotten away clean

03:49.750 --> 03:51.458
if that horse wasn't afraid

Are we done?

07:52.291 --> 07:55.041
Done? We haven't even started

07:52.291 --> 07:55.041
your exam yet.

07:55.083 --> 07:56.458
Great! So, what do you want

07:55.083 --> 07:56.458

She's just trying

08:00.792 --> 08:02.041
to move things along

08:02.083 --> 08:03.834
so you can go see

08:02.083 --> 08:03.834
her brothers.

08:03.875 --> 08:05.625
Always thinking of other people.

08:05.667 --> 08:09.375
That's how we Harpers are--

08:05.667 --> 08:09.375
the perfect model family.

08:09.417 --> 08:12.333
So, uh, new patient, huh?

08:09.417 --> 08:12.333
What brought you to our office?

08:12.375 --> 08:14.000
Well, it's not because

08:12.375 --> 08:14.000
you're the last doctor

08:14.041 --> 08:16.959
within 50 miles, if that's what

08:14.041 --> 08:16.959
you're thinking.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.750
- Why would I think that?

08:17.000 --> 08:18.750
- Pfft!

08:18.792 --> 08:21.625
Ooh, red sticker.

08:18.792 --> 08:21.625
That's never fun.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.959
- I knew it.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.959
- Okay, Mom.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.041
- Too much pressure.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.041
- Tell me about it.

08:26.083 --> 08:28.750
- I need your father.

08:26.083 --> 08:28.750
- No, I'm serious.

08:28.792 --> 08:30.750
Tom, I need you,

08:28.792 --> 08:30.750
where are you?

08:32.750 --> 08:35.208

08:35.250 --> 08:37.333
Still looking for parking, Anne!

08:35.250 --> 08:37.333
It's a jungle out here!

08:37.375 --> 08:38.834
The stupid mattress truck

08:37.375 --> 08:38.834
is taking up half the spots!

08:38.875 --> 08:40.250
I mean, do you really need

08:38.875 --> 08:40.250
that many spots?

08:41.667 --> 08:43.792
All right, all right.

08:41.667 --> 08:43.792
I think this guy's leaving.

08:43.834 --> 08:45.417
Come on, buddy, back out.

08:45.458 --> 08:47.458
Back out, back out, back--

08:45.458 --> 08:47.458
oh, he's pulling back in, Anne.

08:47.500 --> 08:49.166
Why?

08:47.500 --> 08:49.166
Why are you pulling back in?

08:49.208 --> 08:51.166
No!

08:49.208 --> 08:51.166
Life is so unfair!

08:51.208 --> 08:52.500
Ooh, he's pulling back out

08:51.208 --> 08:52.500
again.

08:52.542 --> 08:55.166
Great, great, take it

08:52.542 --> 08:55.166
and get up here, now!

08:59.875 --> 09:01.625
"Physician parking only."

09:01.667 --> 09:04.000
Only when?

09:04.041 --> 09:05.792
Only when your wife is yelling

09:04.041 --> 09:05.792
at you?

09:08.166 --> 09:11.333
Works for me.

09:11.375 --> 09:14.583
So after I got through my exam,

09:11.375 --> 09:14.583
I blew up a latex glove

09:14.625 --> 09:16.083
and made a little turkey.

09:16.125 --> 09:20.375
[mimics turkey gobbling]

Everyone deals with stress

09:28.000 --> 09:30.250
in their own way.

09:30.291 --> 09:32.500
Anyway, Mom went to go help

09:30.291 --> 09:32.500
Ricky and Dicky

09:32.542 --> 09:35.250
while I went to go help Nicky

09:32.542 --> 09:35.250

09:35.291 --> 09:36.709
Better?

09:36.750 --> 09:38.333
It could use a cape.

09:38.375 --> 09:39.834

10:02.417 --> 10:03.667
How's your sticker problem?

10:03.709 --> 10:05.625
Hmm.

10:05.667 --> 10:08.375
Great work.

10:05.667 --> 10:08.375
I'm off to see the whizzer.

10:09.834 --> 10:12.917
- Those.

10:09.834 --> 10:12.917
- Ahh.

10:12.959 --> 10:15.208
This place

10:12.959 --> 10:15.208
is a madhouse today.

10:15.250 --> 10:17.208
I thought you called in

10:15.250 --> 10:17.208
a replacement doctor.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.208
I did. Dr. Fetoosh

10:17.250 --> 10:19.208
was supposed to be here,

10:19.250 --> 10:20.709
but he's running late.

10:20.750 --> 10:23.083
I can't wait to meet him.

10:20.750 --> 10:23.083
I hear he's quite the character.

10:23.125 --> 10:25.041
Hey, hon.

10:23.125 --> 10:25.041
Sorry I'm late.

10:25.083 --> 10:26.583
Good thing that physician spot

10:25.083 --> 10:26.583
was open,

10:26.625 --> 10:29.083
so just call me Doctor.

10:29.125 --> 10:31.208
That's it!

10:29.125 --> 10:31.208
Ah, doctor!

10:31.250 --> 10:34.500
- You're Dr. Fetoosh.

10:31.250 --> 10:34.500
- I am?

10:34.542 --> 10:36.875
Yes, and you're quite

10:34.542 --> 10:36.875
the character.

10:36.917 --> 10:39.333
Ooh.

10:39.375 --> 10:41.166
Wait, why am I doing this

10:39.375 --> 10:41.166
again?

10:41.208 --> 10:43.458
They red-stickered our files,

10:41.208 --> 10:43.458
Tom.

10:43.500 --> 10:46.625
I'm no doctor,

10:43.500 --> 10:46.625
but that can't be good.

10:46.667 --> 10:48.417
You are a doctor,

10:48.458 --> 10:50.917
which means you have access

10:48.458 --> 10:50.917
to the files.

10:50.959 --> 10:53.458
And if we don't change the red

10:50.959 --> 10:53.458
sticker on that file to green,

10:53.500 --> 10:55.166
they'll never let us

10:53.500 --> 10:55.166

11:16.625 --> 11:21.041
I did that on purpose...

11:16.625 --> 11:21.041
'cause I am Dr. Fetoosh.

11:21.083 --> 11:23.959
And I am quite the character.

15:10.667 --> 15:12.125
for his stomach

15:12.166 --> 15:13.458

15:33.792 --> 15:35.834
our burning love of cookies.

15:37.917 --> 15:41.875

19:04.583 --> 19:06.750
and get that shot.

19:32.542 --> 19:35.667
getting a shot was no big deal.

19:47.792 --> 19:51.291
I need a second opinion."

we were banned

21:25.625 --> 21:27.959

21:28.000 --> 21:30.583

21:28.000 --> 21:30.583
we're never allowed back,
