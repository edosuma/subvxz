WEBVTT

00:00.533 --> 00:01.911
Previously, on "Timeless"...

00:01.914 --> 00:04.126
- Your family is lovely.
- My worst fear

00:04.129 --> 00:05.497
is that I could lose them

00:05.500 --> 00:07.168
and not know they were ever here.

00:07.171 --> 00:08.195
Do me a favor.

00:08.197 --> 00:09.906
Keep this in the Lifeboat for me.

00:09.909 --> 00:11.075
When you gave me that book,

00:11.078 --> 00:12.999
you wanted me to read it, and I did.

00:13.001 --> 00:14.668
Sometimes, I feel like I know you

00:14.671 --> 00:15.936
better than you know yourself.

00:15.938 --> 00:17.325
Lucy, I still care about you.

00:17.328 --> 00:19.536
Getting a second chance with Jessica...

00:19.539 --> 00:21.174
That is the closest thing to a miracle

00:21.176 --> 00:23.250
that I have ever seen,
and there is no way

00:23.253 --> 00:24.378
that I am getting in the middle of that.

00:24.380 --> 00:26.955
Let's see what Rittenhouse
has been hiding.

00:26.957 --> 00:29.062
- That's Jessica.
- This stays between us.

00:31.428 --> 00:33.186
Dear Jodie,

00:33.188 --> 00:35.155
there is a definite possibility

00:35.157 --> 00:38.325
that I will be killed in
my attempt to get Reagan.

00:38.327 --> 00:40.427
It is for this very reason

00:40.429 --> 00:43.330
that I am writing you this letter now.

00:43.332 --> 00:47.335
I would abandon this idea of
getting Reagan in a second

00:47.338 --> 00:49.372
if I could only win your heart

00:49.375 --> 00:52.348
and live out the rest
of my life with you,

00:52.351 --> 00:54.241
whether it be in total obscurity,

00:54.243 --> 00:57.023
or whatever.

00:57.026 --> 00:58.793
I will admit to you that the reason

00:58.796 --> 01:01.080
I am going ahead with this attempt now

01:01.083 --> 01:03.183
is because I just cannot wait any longer

01:03.185 --> 01:05.251
to impress you.

01:05.254 --> 01:07.220
I've got to do something now

01:07.222 --> 01:09.990
to make you understand
in no uncertain terms

01:09.992 --> 01:12.184
that I am doing all of this for your sake.

01:13.768 --> 01:16.002
By sacrificing my freedom,

01:16.005 --> 01:18.772
possibly my life,

01:18.775 --> 01:21.909
I hope to change your mind about me.

01:21.912 --> 01:23.846
This letter is being written

01:23.849 --> 01:27.117
an hour before I leave
for the Hilton Hotel.

01:27.120 --> 01:28.986
Jodie,

01:28.989 --> 01:32.045
I'm asking you to please
look into your heart

01:32.047 --> 01:33.731
and at least give me the chance

01:33.734 --> 01:35.101
with this historical deed

01:35.104 --> 01:37.645
to gain your respect and love.

01:37.648 --> 01:39.859
I love you forever.

01:45.227 --> 01:46.828
Hey, that was educational.

01:46.831 --> 01:48.512
So is school, and you're gonna be late.

01:48.515 --> 01:50.096
Eat your breakfast, please, sweetie.

01:50.098 --> 01:51.677
Thought we were gonna
buy the organic kind.

01:51.679 --> 01:53.033
Sugar is sugar.

01:55.617 --> 01:57.337
Your mother.

01:57.339 --> 02:00.040
- No.
- So why don't you answer?

02:00.042 --> 02:01.908
'Cause our Grandma Ananya
doesn't know we exist.

02:01.910 --> 02:03.309
- Why not?
- I'll explain it to you

02:03.312 --> 02:05.345
another time. I gotta get to work.

02:05.347 --> 02:06.906
Are you going to the office,

02:06.909 --> 02:08.734
or the place that's kind of far away?

02:08.737 --> 02:11.183
I will get back as soon
as I can, baby girl.

02:11.186 --> 02:13.590
Mark, I've got a meeting
across town at 4:00,

02:13.593 --> 02:14.891
so I need you to pick up your sister.

02:14.893 --> 02:16.089
No, I was gonna hang with Max.

02:16.091 --> 02:18.391
You can order a pizza.

02:18.393 --> 02:21.928
Save me a slice, stinker.

02:24.399 --> 02:25.820
Hey.

02:25.823 --> 02:27.200
I didn't even hear you wake up.

02:27.202 --> 02:28.843
Uh, yeah, I got up early.

02:28.846 --> 02:30.848
The navigation interface
was running slowly.

02:30.851 --> 02:32.038
Thought I'd reboot the drive.

02:32.040 --> 02:33.039
You need some help?

02:33.041 --> 02:34.941
Uh, actually, I am done.

02:34.943 --> 02:36.243
I'm just gonna get some tea.

02:36.245 --> 02:37.489
I'll make you a cup.

02:37.492 --> 02:38.568
Uh, it's all good.

02:38.571 --> 02:39.637
I got it, thanks.

02:39.640 --> 02:41.214
I know what you're doing.

02:41.216 --> 02:42.983
What am I doing?

02:42.985 --> 02:44.317
You're pushing me away.

02:44.319 --> 02:47.220
Pfft. No, I'm not.

02:47.222 --> 02:49.155
My dad

02:49.157 --> 02:50.991
did the same thing

02:50.993 --> 02:53.360
when he thought he was gonna die.

02:53.362 --> 02:56.429
Thought it would make it easier.

02:56.431 --> 02:58.742
It doesn't, you know.

02:58.745 --> 03:02.269
It just makes you
look like a douche bag.

03:04.000 --> 03:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:17.286 --> 03:19.152
Okay, enough. You've been brooding

03:19.154 --> 03:20.474
like a "Real Housewife" all week.

03:20.476 --> 03:21.476
No, I have...

03:21.479 --> 03:22.883
You watch the "Real Housewives"?

03:22.886 --> 03:24.357
Yes, Rufus, many people watch

03:24.359 --> 03:27.137
truly awful-for-them,
yet delicious, television.

03:27.140 --> 03:28.395
My point is,

03:28.397 --> 03:30.239
quit sulking. Tell us what's going on.

03:30.242 --> 03:31.998
- I don't sulk.
- You sulk.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.168
You've been sulking
up the joint all week.

03:35.170 --> 03:38.004
I'm going to die.

03:38.006 --> 03:39.306
What?

03:39.308 --> 03:40.609
On one of our next trips.

03:40.612 --> 03:42.075
Jiya saw it in a vision of hers.

03:42.077 --> 03:45.145
Hold on, time out. What vision?

03:45.147 --> 03:46.980
Jiya has been seeing
visions of the future

03:46.982 --> 03:48.181
ever since she got out of the Lifeboat.

03:48.183 --> 03:49.895
- What?
- Look, don't worry about it.

03:49.898 --> 03:52.252
- Okay?
- What exactly did she see?

03:52.254 --> 03:54.832
Some guys. Uh, dirty yellow teeth,

03:54.835 --> 03:56.256
grubby clothes, tattoos.

03:56.258 --> 03:58.278
All of them had knives,
spurs on their boots.

03:58.281 --> 03:59.676
You know what? Doesn't matter,

03:59.679 --> 04:00.994
because we're not gonna let that happen.

04:00.996 --> 04:02.040
Yeah, and think of all the times

04:02.042 --> 04:03.229
- that we could've died.
- Right.

04:03.231 --> 04:04.622
- Al Capone.
- Nazi Germany.

04:04.625 --> 04:05.570
The Alamo.

04:05.573 --> 04:07.199
I appreciate the sentiment,

04:07.202 --> 04:09.002
but Jiya's been right before.

04:09.004 --> 04:10.904
Needless to say, I am
going through some things.

04:10.906 --> 04:12.614
Either way, we just need to plan for...

04:13.710 --> 04:15.041
The future.

04:16.244 --> 04:18.178
Hey, Mothership jumped to March 30th,

04:18.180 --> 04:20.046
1981, Washington, D.C.

04:20.048 --> 04:21.700
That's the day that Reagan was shot.

04:21.702 --> 04:22.828
Reagan survived.

04:22.831 --> 04:24.017
Maybe Rittenhouse wants to change it.

04:24.019 --> 04:24.962
Where's Agent Christopher?

04:24.964 --> 04:25.892
Oh, she's probably on her way.

04:25.894 --> 04:27.127
I've tried her cell several times.

04:27.129 --> 04:28.253
She must be in a dead zone.

04:28.256 --> 04:30.223
Guess we go.

04:30.225 --> 04:31.617
You coming?

04:31.620 --> 04:33.606
Much as I enjoy our trips together,

04:33.609 --> 04:35.195
I think I'll stay.

04:35.197 --> 04:38.198
I was in first grade, 1981.

04:38.200 --> 04:41.001
Yes, I also missed it by a month or two.

04:42.404 --> 04:44.037
Yes, all right. Those of us

04:44.039 --> 04:45.205
with life experience

04:45.207 --> 04:46.607
will probably have to sit this one out.

04:46.609 --> 04:49.042
- I'll go.
- I-I-I'm sorry.

04:49.044 --> 04:50.944
Do you really think that's a good idea?

04:50.946 --> 04:53.160
That's why we so brilliantly
put in the fourth seat.

04:53.163 --> 04:55.738
You've already had...
What shall we say... issues

04:55.741 --> 04:57.016
with time travel.

04:57.019 --> 04:58.749
Connor, she's right.

04:58.752 --> 05:00.009
Jiya should come with us.

05:00.012 --> 05:01.987
She needs the experience,
plus, you guys are gonna

05:01.990 --> 05:03.465
need another pilot when I'm gone.

05:21.202 --> 05:22.342
I love the '80s.

05:22.344 --> 05:24.944
On our way home, we have
to stop at a roller rink.

05:24.947 --> 05:26.395
For your first time, you did

05:26.398 --> 05:27.757
a nice job stealing clothes.

05:27.760 --> 05:29.982
Ah, never met a security
tag I couldn't deactivate.

05:29.985 --> 05:32.052
Yeah? What else you take?

05:32.054 --> 05:33.504
Uh, vintage Ray-Bans,

05:33.507 --> 05:34.584
pair of leg warmers...

05:34.587 --> 05:36.262
Oh, and this amazing blue eye shadow.

05:36.265 --> 05:37.773
Guys, focus.

05:37.776 --> 05:38.942
Reagan is finishing

05:38.945 --> 05:40.663
a luncheon address at the Hilton.

05:40.666 --> 05:43.195
It's supposed to happen
on his way out at 2:27 p.m.

05:43.198 --> 05:44.726
Shooter was some nut job

05:44.729 --> 05:46.132
obsessed with Jodie Foster, right?

05:46.134 --> 05:48.001
John Hinckley, the
son of a well-connected

05:48.003 --> 05:49.969
Texas oil family, but
a nut job, nonetheless.

05:49.971 --> 05:51.991
He was going to stalk
Jodie Foster at Yale

05:51.994 --> 05:53.684
when he heard that Reagan was speaking

05:53.687 --> 05:55.325
and thought killing
him would impress her.

05:55.327 --> 05:57.110
As you do. Nobody died?

05:57.112 --> 05:59.527
Press secretary James
Brady was paralyzed

05:59.530 --> 06:02.376
until he ultimately died
in 2014 from his injuries.

06:02.379 --> 06:04.145
Brady Bill's named after him, but no,

06:04.148 --> 06:05.885
nobody's supposed to die, not today.

06:05.887 --> 06:08.289
My guess is Rittenhouse
wants to change that somehow.

06:11.093 --> 06:12.292
Where have you been?

06:12.294 --> 06:13.859
I do have a home and a family

06:13.862 --> 06:15.728
I like to see on
occasion. Where'd they go?

06:15.731 --> 06:17.129
'81, D.C.

06:17.132 --> 06:19.065
- What?
- Yeah.

06:19.067 --> 06:21.067
Off to save Reagan.

06:21.069 --> 06:23.169
No, that's not it.

06:23.171 --> 06:26.039
That's not the reason they're there.

06:28.910 --> 06:31.177
There's Hinckley.

06:31.179 --> 06:32.585
So we just let it happen?

06:32.588 --> 06:33.945
It's not Hinckley I'm worried about.

06:33.947 --> 06:35.247
There's a sleeper around here somewhere.

06:35.249 --> 06:36.249
It's time.

06:51.166 --> 06:53.133
Stay behind the line! Step back!

07:07.115 --> 07:08.314
Get down!

07:21.439 --> 07:24.164
We need an ambulance over here!

07:24.166 --> 07:26.444
Ma'am, you all right?

07:26.447 --> 07:29.102
Just a graze, thanks to you.

07:29.104 --> 07:31.104
Just doing a my job, Officer...

07:31.106 --> 07:32.272
Christopher.

07:35.243 --> 07:36.976
Denise...

07:36.978 --> 07:38.278
Christopher.

07:38.280 --> 07:39.946
Yeah.

07:43.785 --> 07:48.119
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

07:49.758 --> 07:52.068
Wyatt Logan, US Army Special Forces.

07:52.071 --> 07:53.710
Thank you, sir.

07:53.712 --> 07:56.046
I owe you one.

07:56.048 --> 07:58.048
Guys?

07:58.050 --> 07:59.983
Guys, Hinckley got away.

07:59.985 --> 08:01.819
That's not supposed to happen.
He's supposed to be caught.

08:01.821 --> 08:03.620
Wait, Rittenhouse came
here to save Hinckley?

08:03.622 --> 08:05.045
What, they hate Jodie
Foster or something?

08:05.047 --> 08:06.547
Well, not quite. They're here to kill

08:06.550 --> 08:07.791
Agent Christopher

08:07.793 --> 08:09.458
before she becomes Agent Christopher.

08:09.461 --> 08:11.628
Wait, that's her in 1981?

08:11.630 --> 08:12.796
I saw a sleeper.

08:12.798 --> 08:14.477
He's a Secret Service agent.

08:14.480 --> 08:16.413
He's going to be out there
looking to finish the job.

08:16.415 --> 08:18.388
Finish the job? Without
Agent Christopher...

08:18.391 --> 08:19.803
We never would've met.

08:19.805 --> 08:20.943
Yeah.

08:22.204 --> 08:23.974
We've got to get to that hospital.

08:23.976 --> 08:25.790
Wait, Carol Preston

08:25.793 --> 08:27.248
could've killed you three weeks ago.

08:27.251 --> 08:29.412
Why get fancy and go to '81 to do it?

08:29.415 --> 08:31.915
Because it's much bigger than that.

08:31.917 --> 08:35.619
Look, at any given moment,
she could... disappear,

08:35.621 --> 08:36.975
which would effectively
mean the very reality

08:36.977 --> 08:38.951
we're inhabiting would also disappear.

08:38.953 --> 08:41.091
She's that important?

08:41.094 --> 08:44.743
She created the team.
She recruited Wyatt.

08:44.746 --> 08:46.179
When she learned that her superiors

08:46.182 --> 08:47.883
were working with Rittenhouse,
she took us off the grid.

08:47.885 --> 08:50.529
She put over 200 of
their rank behind bars.

08:50.532 --> 08:51.743
So without her...

08:51.746 --> 08:53.208
Rittenhouse would almost certainly

08:53.211 --> 08:55.205
have control of the Lifeboat by now,

08:55.207 --> 08:57.174
which is what they want.

08:57.177 --> 08:59.177
Well, on the plus side, I, uh,

08:59.180 --> 09:01.179
wouldn't have been arrested.

09:02.181 --> 09:04.751
I mean, plus for me, anyway.

09:06.243 --> 09:08.110
Popcorn, anyone?

09:08.120 --> 09:10.120
What about your children?

09:14.093 --> 09:16.579
I trust the team. You
should do the same.

09:16.582 --> 09:18.894
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got some work to do.

09:21.636 --> 09:23.349
Sleeper's gotta be
around here somewhere.

09:23.352 --> 09:26.903
Well, if he's Secret Service,
he's definitely with Reagan.

09:26.905 --> 09:28.839
Well, you saw him. What's he look like?

09:28.841 --> 09:32.042
Coat and tie. "Magnum, P.I." 'stache.

09:32.044 --> 09:33.985
Great. A moustache in a haystack.

09:33.988 --> 09:35.689
We still have to do
something about Hinckley.

09:35.691 --> 09:36.991
Can't exactly make a citizen's arrest,

09:36.993 --> 09:38.660
based on the fact that
we're time travelers.

09:38.662 --> 09:40.896
But Agent Christopher's a cop, right?

09:42.221 --> 09:44.054
Wait.

09:44.056 --> 09:45.288
Think that's him.

09:45.290 --> 09:47.858
Lucy, go with Christopher.

09:47.860 --> 09:49.522
Soon as she's patched up,
tell her about Hinckley.

09:49.524 --> 09:50.927
- She'll know what to do.
- Okay.

09:50.929 --> 09:53.029
- I'll stay with you.
- You sure?

09:53.031 --> 09:53.844
Look, I'm not gonna die today,

09:53.846 --> 09:55.749
but Agent Christopher might,
if we don't find that sleeper,

09:55.751 --> 09:57.751
so let's get a move on.

09:57.754 --> 09:59.086
B...

09:59.089 --> 10:00.956
Okay, bye.

10:00.959 --> 10:02.059
Come on.

10:04.109 --> 10:06.076
I'm Cagney. This is Lacey.

10:06.078 --> 10:07.482
We're private investigators.

10:07.485 --> 10:08.727
I'm Denise.

10:08.730 --> 10:10.113
I kn...

10:10.115 --> 10:12.282
It's just...

10:12.284 --> 10:13.917
really great to meet you.

10:13.919 --> 10:15.218
Okay.

10:15.220 --> 10:17.599
Wait, who are you working for, exactly?

10:17.602 --> 10:19.122
Uh, we're not at liberty to say.

10:19.124 --> 10:20.623
But it is about the man
who shot the president.

10:20.625 --> 10:22.045
They said the president wasn't hurt.

10:22.047 --> 10:23.260
Oh, he's gonna be okay.

10:24.722 --> 10:26.233
I mean, that's what
the doctors were saying.

10:26.235 --> 10:27.334
Have they caught the shooter?

10:27.336 --> 10:28.672
No, but that's why

10:28.675 --> 10:29.893
we need your help.

10:32.971 --> 10:34.237
Thank God you're all right.

10:34.239 --> 10:36.349
I'm fine, Maan. Who told you?

10:36.352 --> 10:38.108
Sachin Kumar saw you on the news.

10:38.110 --> 10:39.276
He told Priya Kapoor,

10:39.278 --> 10:40.561
who works in the hospital with Meera,

10:40.563 --> 10:41.688
and Meera called me.

10:41.691 --> 10:42.518
Well, who needs a phone

10:42.520 --> 10:44.263
when every Indian in
D.C. knows each other?

10:44.266 --> 10:46.082
I almost didn't find you.

10:46.084 --> 10:47.951
I had to ask for "Denise Christopher."

10:47.953 --> 10:49.844
You told me that name
was only for the police.

10:49.847 --> 10:51.899
It was just easier. I could've bled out

10:51.902 --> 10:53.872
before they managed to
spell Dhriti Sirivastava.

10:53.875 --> 10:55.024
You didn't want me to know?

10:55.027 --> 10:56.225
I didn't want you to worry.

10:56.228 --> 10:57.586
When you took this job,

10:57.589 --> 10:59.263
you promised me you wouldn't get hurt.

10:59.266 --> 11:00.618
I barely got grazed.

11:00.621 --> 11:02.064
It's been less than six months!

11:02.067 --> 11:03.867
What if next time is worse?

11:03.869 --> 11:05.001
Here's the part where she tells me

11:05.003 --> 11:06.639
that I have to be a
doctor like my sister.

11:06.641 --> 11:08.039
Doctors don't get shot.

11:08.042 --> 11:10.325
There's nothing wrong with
a career in law enforcement.

11:10.328 --> 11:12.209
- Great benefits.
- And who are you?

11:12.211 --> 11:13.547
- Oh, uh...
- Cagney and Lacey

11:13.550 --> 11:15.550
are investigators.

11:15.553 --> 11:17.947
Dhriti, fix your hair.
The Devatis are here.

11:17.950 --> 11:19.049
- What?
- Yeah.

11:19.051 --> 11:20.263
Why did you call them?

11:20.266 --> 11:21.918
They were worried. We all were.

11:21.920 --> 11:23.220
Tell them I'm fine.

11:23.222 --> 11:24.641
I'll be out of here any minute.

11:24.644 --> 11:27.411
It's time for you to stop
risking your life for this job

11:27.414 --> 11:30.060
and settle down and get married, Dhriti.

11:33.065 --> 11:35.131
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, hello.

11:35.133 --> 11:36.132
We'll just be outside.

11:36.134 --> 11:37.234
Oh, what happened?

11:37.236 --> 11:38.935
We were all worried about you.

11:38.937 --> 11:40.070
Oh...

11:42.824 --> 11:43.940
That's him.

11:46.535 --> 11:48.122
Excuse me, ma'am. I'm looking for

11:48.125 --> 11:50.046
a Denise Christopher.

11:50.048 --> 11:51.882
- On two.
- Thank you.

12:08.233 --> 12:09.933
Going up?

12:25.597 --> 12:28.406
Is the President okay? I heard the news.

12:28.409 --> 12:30.177
They're doing everything
they can, ma'am.

12:31.189 --> 12:33.211
I voted for Carter.

12:57.950 --> 12:59.249
Please don't kill me.

12:59.251 --> 13:00.984
Give me one good reason why not.

13:00.986 --> 13:04.154
Because I'll tell you everything.

13:04.156 --> 13:05.664
Everything!

13:19.369 --> 13:21.336
- What do you think's going on?
- I don't know.

13:24.174 --> 13:27.075
"Cagney & Lacey"
premieres later this year,

13:27.077 --> 13:28.243
by the way.

13:28.245 --> 13:29.444
I like to live on the edge.

13:31.281 --> 13:33.415
How long have you been here?

13:33.417 --> 13:36.129
Since Emma dropped me off in 1969.

13:36.132 --> 13:37.385
12 years.

13:37.387 --> 13:38.462
Must have been lonely,

13:38.465 --> 13:40.525
just you and that moustache.

13:40.528 --> 13:42.257
When were you activated?

13:44.117 --> 13:45.249
This morning.

13:45.252 --> 13:46.252
Who are the other targets

13:46.254 --> 13:48.296
Rittenhouse is after?

13:48.298 --> 13:50.298
The time periods.

13:50.300 --> 13:52.200
I only know about my mission.

13:54.304 --> 13:57.272
What'd they offer you?

13:57.274 --> 13:58.618
Why'd you give up your smartphone

13:58.621 --> 14:01.276
and your Tinder matches for all this?

14:01.278 --> 14:03.312
I didn't have a choice.

14:14.258 --> 14:15.743
Dhriti agreed.

14:15.746 --> 14:17.092
We're getting married!

14:17.094 --> 14:18.293
Oh, beta, congratulations!

14:18.295 --> 14:19.427
What?

14:19.429 --> 14:21.363
No, no, no, no, no, no.

14:21.365 --> 14:22.364
Come here.

14:22.366 --> 14:23.465
Congrats.

14:23.467 --> 14:25.233
This is all wrong. She's gay.

14:25.235 --> 14:26.978
She has a wife, Michelle, and two kids.

14:26.981 --> 14:28.525
- I have met them.
- Okay, wait.

14:28.528 --> 14:30.798
This guy existed before we
got here, so she must have

14:30.801 --> 14:32.274
changed her mind the
first time around, right?

14:32.276 --> 14:33.508
She told me that her
mother tried to arrange

14:33.510 --> 14:35.410
a few marriages for her,
but she made up excuses,

14:35.412 --> 14:37.112
dodged them all until
she went to Quantico.

14:37.114 --> 14:38.413
Okay, so when'd she come out to her mom?

14:38.415 --> 14:39.526
She still hasn't. They only talk

14:39.528 --> 14:41.149
a couple times a year.

14:41.151 --> 14:42.417
Okay, so then she'll
change her mind, right?

14:42.419 --> 14:44.386
- Sh-she'll call it off.
- Not necessarily.

14:44.388 --> 14:45.791
I mean, the first time around,
she'd never brushed with death.

14:45.793 --> 14:47.155
She wasn't shot in the arm.

14:47.157 --> 14:48.323
She wasn't in this hospital.

14:48.325 --> 14:50.158
What if he makes her
give up police work?

14:50.160 --> 14:51.359
She doesn't end up in the FBI,

14:51.361 --> 14:52.837
she doesn't join Homeland Security,

14:52.840 --> 14:54.614
Rittenhouse wins. We're toast.

14:56.366 --> 14:58.133
Agent Chris...

14:58.135 --> 14:59.799
I'm sorry, Denise.

14:59.802 --> 15:01.626
So sorry to interrupt, but can we please

15:01.629 --> 15:03.150
just talk to you for one minute?

15:03.153 --> 15:04.218
It won't take long.

15:04.221 --> 15:07.042
I'll meet you downstairs.

15:07.044 --> 15:10.145
Thank you.

15:10.147 --> 15:12.030
Look, if this is about the shooting,

15:12.033 --> 15:13.488
you probably should call the hotline.

15:13.490 --> 15:14.874
They probably won't believe us.

15:14.877 --> 15:16.655
- Why not?
- We believe that

15:16.658 --> 15:18.780
a disturbed young man
named John Hinckley

15:18.783 --> 15:19.796
shot the President.

15:19.799 --> 15:21.323
He's obsessed with Jodie Foster,

15:21.325 --> 15:23.499
so he imitated the plot
in the movie "Taxi Driver"

15:23.502 --> 15:25.297
- to impress her.
- You're right.

15:25.300 --> 15:26.280
They won't believe you.

15:26.283 --> 15:27.395
He's staying in room 312

15:27.397 --> 15:29.384
at the Park Central
Hotel. We can prove it.

15:29.387 --> 15:30.553
How do you know all this?

15:30.556 --> 15:32.200
- Because...
- Jodie Foster hired us.

15:32.202 --> 15:33.846
Yes, yes, she did.

15:33.849 --> 15:35.081
Hinckley... he made these threats.

15:35.083 --> 15:36.320
- We tracked him here.
- But we were

15:36.322 --> 15:38.473
too late to stop him.

15:38.475 --> 15:40.208
You need to come with us.

15:40.210 --> 15:42.096
My mother, the family...
They're waiting.

15:42.099 --> 15:44.079
Apparently, she's throwing
a party tonight, and...

15:44.081 --> 15:46.147
Denise.

15:46.149 --> 15:47.963
You have an opportunity to catch the man

15:47.966 --> 15:49.517
who shot the President.

15:49.519 --> 15:52.283
I know you can't walk away from that.

15:55.158 --> 15:57.593
Yeah, hi. I'm officer
Denise Christopher.

15:57.596 --> 15:59.060
Can you answer some questions?

15:59.062 --> 16:00.382
Hey, uh, crazy idea.

16:00.385 --> 16:02.063
We could, you know, just...

16:02.065 --> 16:03.331
tell her the truth.

16:03.333 --> 16:05.133
Who we are, why she can't get married,

16:05.135 --> 16:07.235
why she has to join the Feds.

16:07.237 --> 16:08.674
Okay, I know, but look,

16:08.677 --> 16:10.491
if anyone would believe us, she would,

16:10.494 --> 16:12.040
plus, there's the
whole "fate of the world

16:12.042 --> 16:13.408
depends on it" thing.

16:13.410 --> 16:15.143
For all we know, it
could make things worse,

16:15.145 --> 16:16.728
not better.

16:16.731 --> 16:18.812
Besides, we can't let her live
the next 30 years of her life

16:18.814 --> 16:20.315
under that kind of pressure.

16:20.317 --> 16:23.091
- The manager's on break.
- Okay.

16:23.094 --> 16:24.093
We'll wait.

16:24.096 --> 16:25.406
I radioed my lieutenant.

16:25.409 --> 16:26.608
He says it sound bogus.

16:26.611 --> 16:28.869
We promise, it's totally not bogus.

16:31.428 --> 16:33.963
So, you're engaged.

16:33.966 --> 16:35.096
Exciting.

16:35.098 --> 16:36.316
It is.

16:36.319 --> 16:37.485
You're so young.

16:37.488 --> 16:39.288
How do you know that Sunil is the one?

16:39.291 --> 16:40.928
We've known his family for a long time.

16:40.931 --> 16:42.270
But do you love him?

16:42.272 --> 16:44.339
In our culture, marriage comes first.

16:44.341 --> 16:46.409
- You find love along the way.
- But what if you don't?

16:46.411 --> 16:48.499
No offense, but we've
been doing it this way

16:48.502 --> 16:50.111
for, like, thousands of years.

16:50.113 --> 16:53.647
Divorce rate's what, 50% here?
How's your way working out?

16:53.650 --> 16:55.027
I'm not saying there's
anything wrong with that.

16:55.029 --> 16:57.284
I'm just wondering, what
if it wasn't right for...

16:57.287 --> 16:58.683
you?

16:58.686 --> 17:01.081
- What do you mean?
- Well, I mean, like, what if

17:01.091 --> 17:02.323
Sunil just isn't your type?

17:02.325 --> 17:03.391
- Yeah.
- You know what I mean?

17:03.393 --> 17:05.026
Like, some women don't like men

17:05.028 --> 17:06.194
who are shorter than they are.

17:06.195 --> 17:08.851
Some women don't like man buns.

17:08.854 --> 17:12.166
- What's a man bun?
- Some women

17:12.169 --> 17:15.270
don't like men at all.

17:15.271 --> 17:16.766
It's okay. There's

17:16.769 --> 17:18.531
absolutely nothing to be ashamed of.

17:18.534 --> 17:20.175
No, I know that.

17:20.176 --> 17:21.209
I mean,

17:21.211 --> 17:23.211
you're gorgeous, and

17:23.213 --> 17:24.479
I'm flattered, but...

17:24.481 --> 17:26.875
- I'm not interested.
- Oh. Oh!

17:26.877 --> 17:28.664
Uh, um, no.

17:28.667 --> 17:30.529
I, um,

17:30.532 --> 17:32.633
wasn't hitting on you, um...

17:32.636 --> 17:34.456
because, uh,

17:34.458 --> 17:37.392
Cagney...

17:37.394 --> 17:40.219
here, uh, we're... We're together.

17:40.222 --> 17:42.197
- Yep.
- Yeah, just...

17:42.199 --> 17:43.726
- Together, so...
- Yep.

17:43.729 --> 17:46.134
And we were just kind of getting a vibe.

17:46.136 --> 17:47.742
Yeah, you totally set off our gay-dar.

17:47.745 --> 17:50.305
- "Gay-dar"?
- Were we wrong?

17:50.307 --> 17:51.539
I...

17:51.541 --> 17:53.529
experimented back in college, okay,

17:53.532 --> 17:55.250
but... I'm an adult now.

17:55.253 --> 17:57.145
I don't think that it's, you know,

17:57.147 --> 18:00.558
something that really... goes away.

18:00.561 --> 18:02.828
I totally respect the two of you,

18:02.831 --> 18:04.562
but that's not an option for me.

18:09.059 --> 18:10.729
I know what it's like.

18:10.732 --> 18:13.127
Look, my parents... they
had all these expectations

18:13.130 --> 18:14.462
for me when they moved here.

18:14.465 --> 18:16.446
All the other kids were
out partying and drinking,

18:16.449 --> 18:17.781
and I was studying.

18:17.784 --> 18:19.250
And my dad died, and my mom...

18:19.253 --> 18:21.236
She moved back to Lebanon.

18:21.238 --> 18:24.073
I finally had to start
making my own choices.

18:25.841 --> 18:28.876
I just wish I'd started
making those choices sooner.

18:30.180 --> 18:32.413
We both have demanding mothers,

18:32.415 --> 18:36.050
but we didn't let them dictate
our future or our happiness.

18:36.052 --> 18:37.492
My cousin married a white guy.

18:37.495 --> 18:39.195
It's been ten years, and her parents

18:39.198 --> 18:41.189
still don't talk to her.

18:41.191 --> 18:43.761
Sunil's nice. He likes me.

18:43.764 --> 18:45.664
But you'll never like him the same way.

18:45.667 --> 18:46.914
It doesn't seem fair to him.

18:46.917 --> 18:48.196
It's already been decided.

18:48.198 --> 18:49.815
We're celebrating tonight.

18:49.818 --> 18:51.266
My mother drives me crazy,

18:51.268 --> 18:53.301
but she sure can cook.

18:53.303 --> 18:54.559
There's the manager.

18:54.562 --> 18:55.596
Let's go.

18:57.307 --> 18:59.711
You have a guest staying
in one of your rooms...

19:08.636 --> 19:10.285
Wait outside, please.

19:10.288 --> 19:12.471
Don't touch anything.

19:17.511 --> 19:19.660
You weren't kidding about this guy.

19:21.749 --> 19:23.650
Hey, look at this.

19:30.391 --> 19:31.719
This is a written confession.

19:31.722 --> 19:34.118
Oh. #MeTooForJodie.

19:34.121 --> 19:35.887
- What?
- Nothing.

19:37.222 --> 19:38.764
So where do you think he is now?

19:38.766 --> 19:40.432
Jodie is a student at Yale,

19:40.434 --> 19:41.667
in New Haven.

19:41.669 --> 19:43.535
It's possible that's where he went next.

19:43.537 --> 19:45.238
He would've checked out first.

19:50.754 --> 19:52.587
Is that blood?

19:55.449 --> 19:56.749
That's not supposed to happen.

20:01.856 --> 20:04.332
Do you think he killed himself?

20:04.335 --> 20:05.568
Then where's the body?

20:05.571 --> 20:07.458
Pretty sure he didn't
cut himself shaving.

20:07.461 --> 20:08.661
Guys like this...

20:08.663 --> 20:10.161
It's not about getting away with it.

20:10.164 --> 20:11.764
It's about notoriety.

20:11.766 --> 20:14.336
He'd want to know what he did mattered.

20:14.339 --> 20:16.539
He'd want to know if he was successful.

20:16.542 --> 20:19.046
He wants to know if Reagan survived.

20:19.049 --> 20:20.639
- And if he did?
- There's only one way

20:20.641 --> 20:21.807
into the emergency room

20:21.809 --> 20:24.610
that's secured by Secret Service.

20:24.612 --> 20:26.412
Create an emergency.

20:26.414 --> 20:28.614
Just be more careful next time.

20:40.628 --> 20:42.359
Suspect is a Caucasian male,

20:42.362 --> 20:43.926
25 years old, possibly wounded

20:43.929 --> 20:45.497
with a straight razor.

20:52.440 --> 20:54.573
My father...

20:54.575 --> 20:56.810
he was caught embezzling money.

20:57.819 --> 20:59.984
My family lost everything.

21:01.449 --> 21:02.809
And my dad killed himself.

21:02.812 --> 21:04.783
Cry me a river, Madoff.

21:04.785 --> 21:07.619
Rittenhouse bailed us out.

21:07.621 --> 21:10.456
My mom, my brother Zac, and me.

21:10.458 --> 21:12.515
Zac bought into all their ideology,

21:12.518 --> 21:14.903
but I had my doubts. Carol Preston...

21:14.906 --> 21:17.596
She promised she would take care of us.

21:17.598 --> 21:19.765
She just wanted something in return.

21:21.469 --> 21:22.735
Time travel.

21:25.473 --> 21:27.506
Sounded like an incredible adventure.

21:27.508 --> 21:29.343
Going through time, killing people?

21:29.346 --> 21:30.546
That sounded like an adventure?

21:30.548 --> 21:31.710
No, they didn't tell me about that,

21:31.712 --> 21:33.846
not until this morning.

21:33.848 --> 21:36.176
That how it normally works?

21:36.179 --> 21:37.851
I don't know.

21:44.891 --> 21:48.793
Why'd they bring my wife back?

21:48.796 --> 21:50.462
I don't know anything about that.

21:50.464 --> 21:51.498
Mm.

21:58.506 --> 22:00.171
Please, I don't. I don't.

22:00.174 --> 22:02.507
I only know about my
mission. That's it, I swear.

22:02.510 --> 22:05.578
Please, I got a wife
and two kids in 2018.

22:06.714 --> 22:08.514
If I don't do what Rittenhouse says,

22:08.516 --> 22:09.715
they're gonna kill them.

22:09.717 --> 22:13.485
Please, do whatever you want to me.

22:13.487 --> 22:15.484
I just want them to be safe.

22:24.498 --> 22:26.754
I'm gonna tell the
lieutenant everything you did.

22:26.757 --> 22:28.031
Um, you don't have to do that.

22:28.034 --> 22:30.161
We, um... we wouldn't want
to jeopardize our clients.

22:30.164 --> 22:32.787
We... we work undercover a lot, so...

22:32.790 --> 22:34.090
Usually as prostitutes.

22:34.093 --> 22:35.641
Sure.

22:35.644 --> 22:37.744
So you think you'll keep being a cop

22:37.747 --> 22:38.879
after you're married?

22:38.882 --> 22:41.480
Sunil's family's pretty traditional.

22:41.482 --> 22:44.031
Sunil's completing his residency, so...

22:44.034 --> 22:45.872
they'll be expecting me to stay at home.

22:45.875 --> 22:47.686
But you're so good,

22:47.688 --> 22:50.265
and you love this.

22:51.559 --> 22:54.660
You want to know why I became a cop?

22:54.662 --> 22:56.528
When I was four,

22:56.530 --> 22:58.831
my father bought a Cadillac.

22:58.833 --> 23:00.833
He was so proud.

23:00.835 --> 23:02.281
He would tell us all

23:02.284 --> 23:05.367
how he came from India
with only $10 to his name,

23:05.370 --> 23:07.772
how it was his American dream.

23:07.775 --> 23:09.708
He stopped for gas.

23:09.710 --> 23:12.187
There was a man with a gun.

23:12.190 --> 23:13.745
He tried to stop him,

23:13.747 --> 23:16.140
not because of the car,

23:16.143 --> 23:19.211
but because I was in the back seat.

23:19.214 --> 23:21.415
He shot my father.

23:22.991 --> 23:25.556
An off-duty cop saw what
happened and arrested him.

23:25.559 --> 23:27.659
- Your father... did he...
- He was killed instantly.

23:27.661 --> 23:28.827
Oh, my God.

23:28.829 --> 23:31.148
I never knew that.

23:31.151 --> 23:32.831
I-I mean,

23:32.833 --> 23:34.466
I'm so sorry.

23:34.468 --> 23:35.701
I was crying.

23:36.804 --> 23:39.738
They sent someone to watch me.

23:39.740 --> 23:41.774
I'd never seen a female cop before.

23:43.611 --> 23:45.382
Officer Christopher.

23:46.847 --> 23:50.582
I asked her why a girl
would want to be a cop.

23:50.584 --> 23:53.653
She said she wanted
to stop the bad guys.

23:54.622 --> 23:57.556
I promised myself that
was what I was gonna do.

23:57.558 --> 23:59.424
So then why would you
want to give it up?

23:59.426 --> 24:00.659
Because I also promised my mother

24:00.661 --> 24:02.840
she would never lose
me the way she lost him.

24:02.843 --> 24:04.663
Christopher.

24:04.665 --> 24:06.218
Can I see you for a minute?

24:06.221 --> 24:07.354
Yes, of course.

24:08.801 --> 24:10.864
There's some people that
would like to speak to you.

24:10.867 --> 24:12.471
Jiya, we have to stop this marriage.

24:12.473 --> 24:15.036
Okay, uh, w-what can we do?

24:16.810 --> 24:18.644
I have an idea,

24:18.646 --> 24:20.515
but we have to get
something from the Lifeboat.

24:20.518 --> 24:21.583
Come on.

24:21.586 --> 24:23.234
What exactly are you doing?

24:23.237 --> 24:24.422
Paperwork.

24:24.425 --> 24:26.625
No, I mean, w-what are you doing?

24:26.628 --> 24:28.515
Aren't you the least bit concerned

24:28.518 --> 24:31.252
that... you're gonna be
snuffed out of existence?

24:31.255 --> 24:33.555
I trust the team.

24:33.558 --> 24:35.691
What about your family?

24:35.694 --> 24:37.694
If I die in '81,

24:37.697 --> 24:39.664
Michelle and I will never meet.

24:39.667 --> 24:41.567
The children... They wouldn't exist.

24:41.569 --> 24:43.635
And yet,

24:43.637 --> 24:46.872
here you sit, doing paperwork.

24:46.874 --> 24:48.508
Wow.

24:50.117 --> 24:51.610
What would you have me do?

24:51.612 --> 24:52.744
Try to save myself,

24:52.746 --> 24:54.004
or get my affairs in order?

24:54.007 --> 24:55.547
How exactly does one prepare for

24:55.549 --> 24:57.872
one's absence from the past 37 years?

24:57.875 --> 24:59.445
I have wracked my brain,

24:59.448 --> 25:00.864
trying to come up with a solution,

25:00.867 --> 25:03.388
but there is... There's
nothing I can do.

25:03.390 --> 25:05.725
Oh, no, no. You're wrong.

25:06.923 --> 25:08.809
One night, three years ago,

25:08.812 --> 25:11.101
I was putting my daughter to bed.

25:11.104 --> 25:12.801
She wanted to stay up later.

25:12.804 --> 25:14.600
Said, "Ten more minutes, Daddy.

25:14.602 --> 25:16.735
Three more minutes."

25:16.737 --> 25:19.838
As any good parent, I
told her to go to sleep.

25:19.840 --> 25:21.740
I told her I'd see her in the morning.

25:21.742 --> 25:23.742
The next time I saw her,

25:23.744 --> 25:26.778
she was dead.

25:26.780 --> 25:29.648
See, that night

25:29.650 --> 25:32.484
I've done nothing

25:32.486 --> 25:34.519
but try to change that, and I failed.

25:34.521 --> 25:36.179
I'm sorry about that,

25:36.182 --> 25:38.992
- I really am...
- Save your pity.

25:41.428 --> 25:43.862
Do you know what I would give

25:43.864 --> 25:46.598
if I'd had those three
more minutes with her,

25:46.600 --> 25:48.600
one more minute, one more

25:48.602 --> 25:51.870
second?

25:51.872 --> 25:53.705
So you can sit there doing paperwork

25:53.707 --> 25:55.574
and fretting about time travel rules,

25:55.576 --> 25:58.928
or you can get the hell back home

25:58.931 --> 26:00.864
and look at your wife and children

26:00.867 --> 26:03.682
while you still can.

26:03.684 --> 26:06.451
And it's your choice.

26:06.453 --> 26:08.454
I sure as hell know what I'd do.

26:13.727 --> 26:16.361
So we're just gonna kill him?

26:16.363 --> 26:18.597
Well, we can't leave him here, Rufus.

26:18.599 --> 26:19.799
Wyatt.

26:22.770 --> 26:26.505
Look, we've never
caught a sleeper before.

26:26.507 --> 26:28.437
What if we take him with us?

26:28.440 --> 26:30.542
Like a POW? We make two trips.

26:30.544 --> 26:32.644
Just kill me.

26:32.646 --> 26:34.856
I can't go back there.
I'd be better off dead.

26:34.859 --> 26:36.648
- Sounds good.
- No, wait, whoa, whoa.

26:36.650 --> 26:38.583
We don't just kill people.

26:38.585 --> 26:40.476
We are different from Rittenhouse.

26:40.479 --> 26:41.625
Then leave me in '81.

26:41.628 --> 26:43.008
What, so you can just
go after Christopher

26:43.010 --> 26:44.739
- the moment we leave?
- I promise I won't.

26:44.742 --> 26:46.176
Why the hell should we trust you?

26:46.179 --> 26:49.078
I'll tell you about my brother.

26:49.081 --> 26:51.482
He came here to activate me.

26:51.485 --> 26:53.251
I stole Christopher's file

26:53.254 --> 26:55.399
from the hospital
with her address in it,

26:55.402 --> 26:57.171
and I gave it to him.

26:57.174 --> 26:58.440
Zac's probably on his way

26:58.443 --> 27:00.538
to take out Officer
Christopher right now.

27:00.541 --> 27:02.973
- Could've told us that before!
- Telling you now.

27:02.976 --> 27:04.645
Why would you sell out your own brother?

27:04.648 --> 27:06.712
Rittenhouse brainwashed him.

27:06.714 --> 27:08.132
If he lives, he'll tell them,

27:08.135 --> 27:10.548
and my family'll pay the price.

27:10.551 --> 27:12.451
You can stop him.

27:12.453 --> 27:13.752
I'll give you the address

27:13.754 --> 27:15.454
if you... if you just let me go.

27:15.456 --> 27:16.722
If...

27:16.724 --> 27:19.624
we get there in time to save our friend,

27:19.626 --> 27:21.626
then we'll worry about
what to do with you.

27:39.674 --> 27:41.069
I'll get it.

27:48.145 --> 27:49.348
Uh...

27:51.181 --> 27:53.015
Okay, still not hitting on you,

27:53.017 --> 27:54.917
but you look amazing!

27:54.919 --> 27:56.285
Thanks.

27:56.287 --> 27:57.622
How did you find me?

27:57.625 --> 27:59.021
Uh, white pages.

27:59.023 --> 28:00.201
Go figure. Your mom's the only

28:00.203 --> 28:01.957
Ananya Sirivastava in D.C.

28:03.227 --> 28:06.128
Is there somewhere private we can talk?

28:06.130 --> 28:09.458
Time travel. You're joking.

28:09.461 --> 28:11.166
It sounds impossible, we know.

28:11.168 --> 28:12.711
No, it sounds insane.

28:12.714 --> 28:14.421
- You both should leave, now.
- No, no, no!

28:14.424 --> 28:16.171
Please, Denise, wait. We can
show you... we have proof.

28:16.173 --> 28:18.040
Just give us one minute. Please, okay?

28:18.042 --> 28:19.388
Have you ever seen a
computer like this before?

28:19.390 --> 28:20.407
- No.
- That's because

28:20.410 --> 28:21.589
- it's from 2018.
- And it's how

28:21.591 --> 28:22.590
we knew about Hinckley.

28:22.593 --> 28:23.592
But that's impossible.

28:23.595 --> 28:24.791
Time travel doesn't exist

28:24.794 --> 28:25.793
except in movies.

28:25.796 --> 28:27.014
Not now, but it will.

28:27.017 --> 28:28.250
- It does.
- Oh?

28:28.252 --> 28:29.952
Then why didn't you tell me this before?

28:29.954 --> 28:31.019
Because we were...

28:31.021 --> 28:32.418
We were trying to protect you.

28:34.325 --> 28:36.291
Every day, we make decisions.

28:36.293 --> 28:37.789
Get married, don't get married,

28:37.792 --> 28:38.858
take this job or that job,

28:38.861 --> 28:40.127
go left or right,

28:40.130 --> 28:41.804
and at the time, they seem
like they don't matter,

28:41.806 --> 28:43.706
but they do, especially in your case.

28:43.709 --> 28:45.132
Why in my case?

28:45.135 --> 28:47.336
You get recruited by the FBI.

28:47.338 --> 28:49.261
You work for Homeland Security.

28:49.264 --> 28:50.511
What's Homeland Security?

28:50.514 --> 28:52.107
It's a... in 20...

28:52.109 --> 28:53.342
Um...

28:53.344 --> 28:55.177
It's too hard to explain right now,

28:55.179 --> 28:56.201
but the point is

28:56.204 --> 28:57.312
you're at the top of your field.

28:57.314 --> 28:58.725
You save so many lives.

28:58.728 --> 29:00.148
Including ours.

29:00.150 --> 29:02.615
You have a family.

29:02.618 --> 29:04.952
But it's not with Sunil.

29:08.959 --> 29:11.059
That's Michelle.

29:11.061 --> 29:12.260
Your wife.

29:16.100 --> 29:18.240
Mark and Olivia are your children.

29:21.271 --> 29:22.971
No.

29:22.973 --> 29:25.073
That's...

29:25.075 --> 29:26.370
That can't be.

29:31.315 --> 29:35.084
That's you. That's your family.

29:40.024 --> 29:41.957
Two women

29:41.959 --> 29:43.158
can get married?

29:43.160 --> 29:45.127
In 2015... Sooner in California.

29:45.129 --> 29:46.294
California?

29:46.296 --> 29:48.139
That's where you all live.

29:54.405 --> 29:57.172
Why are you doing this?

29:57.174 --> 30:00.008
Because you asked me to.

30:00.010 --> 30:02.978
In 2017, you invite me over
to your house for dinner,

30:02.980 --> 30:05.936
and you introduce me to your family,

30:05.939 --> 30:07.839
and you give me this.

30:07.842 --> 30:09.216
It's a...

30:09.219 --> 30:11.353
It's kind of like a floppy disk.

30:11.355 --> 30:14.289
And you made me promise

30:14.291 --> 30:16.308
to show you this, in
case something happened.

30:16.311 --> 30:18.123
What do you mean, "if
something happened"?

30:19.295 --> 30:21.129
In case they disappeared from history.

30:21.131 --> 30:23.031
Which they will, if you marry Sunil.

30:35.179 --> 30:37.412
Denise, you have to
call off this engagement.

30:39.349 --> 30:43.418
You have to tell your mother
the truth about who you are.

30:43.420 --> 30:45.287
Before anyone gets hurt.

32:00.163 --> 32:03.787
How do you think the talk is going?

32:03.790 --> 32:06.067
You know, we could have
told her everything.

32:06.069 --> 32:07.186
About Rittenhouse.

32:07.189 --> 32:08.134
We have no idea

32:08.137 --> 32:10.568
what kind of butterfly
effect that would create.

32:10.571 --> 32:12.843
Knowing the future is
a huge responsibility.

32:12.846 --> 32:14.241
I wouldn't wish it on anyone.

32:18.115 --> 32:20.182
- I'm sorry.
- This gift

32:20.184 --> 32:22.350
that I have... I mean, what's it for?

32:22.352 --> 32:24.756
So I can start grieving in advance?

32:26.356 --> 32:29.157
Maybe Rufus is right.

32:29.159 --> 32:31.159
Maybe I'm supposed
to walk away from him.

32:35.399 --> 32:38.233
Jiya.

32:38.235 --> 32:41.069
Did you ever think that maybe
you were seeing these things

32:41.071 --> 32:43.372
so that you can safe Rufus?

32:44.408 --> 32:48.210
Just like we're trying to save her.

32:48.212 --> 32:51.213
I used to think that
history was set in stone,

32:51.215 --> 32:53.348
unchangeable,

32:53.350 --> 32:56.985
and then my sister disappeared.

32:56.987 --> 32:59.354
And I just...

32:59.356 --> 33:01.257
I just see how fragile it all is.

33:03.126 --> 33:05.026
If we can change the past,

33:05.028 --> 33:08.029
there has to be a way that
we can change the future.

33:57.177 --> 33:59.177
No, no, no, no, no, no!

34:09.522 --> 34:13.157
We were gonna let you go.

34:13.159 --> 34:16.195
Must've thought Rittenhouse
would find him, no matter what.

34:17.297 --> 34:19.429
In a way,

34:19.431 --> 34:22.134
I guess he was a victim, too.

34:37.550 --> 34:39.284
What do I do now?

34:42.554 --> 34:45.223
Take that job with the FBI.

34:45.225 --> 34:48.326
The rest will fall into place.

34:48.328 --> 34:50.228
What if I make the wrong decisions?

34:50.230 --> 34:52.231
You won't, I promise.

34:54.033 --> 34:56.300
Here, take this.

34:56.302 --> 34:58.236
You won't be able to use
it for another 20 years,

34:58.238 --> 35:01.340
but it will help you remember
why you're doing all of this.

35:06.045 --> 35:08.145
Come here.

35:08.147 --> 35:10.381
- Thank you.
- It's gonna be okay.

35:52.872 --> 35:55.293
I've waited 37 years

35:55.295 --> 35:58.129
to say thank you to you.

35:58.131 --> 35:59.705
No thanks necessary, ma'am.

35:59.708 --> 36:02.060
Well, you saved my life twice.

36:02.063 --> 36:03.263
Guess that's why I always knew

36:03.266 --> 36:08.035
you were the right man for this job.

36:08.038 --> 36:10.107
"Cagney" and "Lacey."

36:12.111 --> 36:15.079
You saved my family.
I've never forgotten that.

36:15.081 --> 36:18.316
I'm so sorry to put that
kind of pressure on you.

36:18.318 --> 36:20.084
I can't imagine the stress.

36:23.289 --> 36:25.324
Maybe you should hold
on to this for now.

36:28.494 --> 36:31.362
I can't tell you what it was like

36:31.364 --> 36:36.500
the first time I saw a computer
that could use one of those.

36:36.502 --> 36:39.370
Right, well, now that
everyone's back safely,

36:39.372 --> 36:41.997
I'll be taking off
early. It's family night,

36:42.000 --> 36:44.374
and my mother's got a chicken biryani

36:44.377 --> 36:46.477
and a shrimp curry waiting for me.

36:46.479 --> 36:48.212
I'll bring you leftovers.

36:48.214 --> 36:50.481
Wait, wait, your mother?

36:50.483 --> 36:52.216
Yeah. It wasn't an easy road,

36:52.218 --> 36:55.319
but... she came around eventually.

36:55.321 --> 36:57.488
It must be nice, uh,

36:57.490 --> 36:59.290
having her in your life.

36:59.292 --> 37:01.385
Oh, we still have our moments.

37:01.388 --> 37:03.455
You know what a pain in the ass she is,

37:03.458 --> 37:08.232
but she sure can cook, and...

37:08.234 --> 37:11.135
she loves my kids.

37:11.137 --> 37:14.372
I can't imagine our lives without her.

37:14.374 --> 37:17.508
There were definitely
some rough patches, but...

37:17.510 --> 37:22.113
knowing what was waiting for me...

37:22.115 --> 37:24.048
it gave me hope.

37:29.155 --> 37:30.454
You tried to save him.

37:30.456 --> 37:33.380
There was nothing
else you could've done.

37:33.383 --> 37:35.408
He tried to kill Agent Christopher.

37:35.411 --> 37:36.974
Because they threatened his family.

37:36.977 --> 37:38.977
Believe me, I've been there.

37:38.980 --> 37:40.946
That could've been me.

37:40.949 --> 37:43.067
- Could still be me.
- What are you talking about?

37:43.069 --> 37:46.203
If your visions end up true, then...

37:46.205 --> 37:48.439
I could end up just like that sleeper.

37:48.441 --> 37:50.441
Alone,

37:50.443 --> 37:52.443
dead in the past,

37:52.445 --> 37:55.822
some unidentified body,
an 18th-century John Doe.

37:55.825 --> 37:58.416
You're not alone, Rufus.

37:58.418 --> 38:01.185
Okay? You have the team.

38:01.187 --> 38:02.253
You have me.

38:10.296 --> 38:13.097
I don't know how much time I have,

38:13.099 --> 38:16.500
or how I'm gonna end up, but...

38:16.502 --> 38:20.404
whatever time I have left,
I want to spend it with you.

38:20.406 --> 38:24.108
From now on, it is me and you,

38:24.110 --> 38:27.077
all in, whatever you want.

38:27.079 --> 38:28.729
Even if it's a "Lord of the Rings"

38:28.732 --> 38:30.214
extended edition marathon

38:30.216 --> 38:32.904
as long as every second I have left

38:32.907 --> 38:34.941
is spent with you.

38:34.944 --> 38:36.977
What if I'm not okay with that?

38:36.980 --> 38:39.088
This is a weird time
to break up with me.

38:39.091 --> 38:41.247
No, I mean,

38:41.250 --> 38:42.983
I mean, we have to try to stop it.

38:42.986 --> 38:44.447
- But your visions...
- I don't care

38:44.450 --> 38:46.497
if they come true.

38:46.499 --> 38:48.872
Look, we're problem solvers, Rufus.

38:48.875 --> 38:51.234
We don't just give up. We find a way.

38:51.237 --> 38:53.337
We make more time.

38:53.339 --> 38:55.697
Okay, 'cause the only
visions I want to see

38:55.700 --> 38:58.142
are of you and me growing old together,

38:58.144 --> 39:00.541
bickering over what TV
series we're gonna binge next,

39:00.544 --> 39:02.313
and of...

39:05.318 --> 39:07.084
I'm so in love with you.

39:12.091 --> 39:14.458
When you gave me the journal,
you said you got it from me.

39:14.460 --> 39:16.044
Please do come in.

39:16.047 --> 39:17.980
I want to know what you meant by that.

39:17.983 --> 39:20.263
- Sure you want to know?
- Yes.

39:20.266 --> 39:21.433
I do.

39:30.627 --> 39:32.861
It was two weeks after
my family was killed.

39:32.864 --> 39:36.413
I was, uh, alone, in hiding.

39:36.415 --> 39:39.116
The only thing keeping
me from killing myself

39:39.118 --> 39:40.693
was the idea of

39:40.696 --> 39:42.950
stopping these beasts
who had done this thing.

39:42.953 --> 39:46.189
At that point, I had no... plans.

39:46.192 --> 39:48.904
I ran as far as I could.

39:48.907 --> 39:50.293
I ended up in a bar,

39:50.296 --> 39:54.265
in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

39:54.267 --> 39:58.203
I was on my third drink
when you walked in.

39:59.305 --> 40:00.943
You looked maybe

40:00.946 --> 40:03.013
five years older than you look now,

40:03.016 --> 40:04.983
uh, but no less...

40:07.245 --> 40:08.378
You looked good.

40:08.381 --> 40:10.080
You told me your name.

40:10.082 --> 40:12.082
You... you knew everything.

40:12.084 --> 40:13.484
How my family died.

40:13.486 --> 40:17.555
That Rittenhouse was behind all of this.

40:17.557 --> 40:20.257
You told me

40:20.259 --> 40:23.093
there is a way for me to stop them,

40:23.095 --> 40:25.362
and that to do it,

40:25.364 --> 40:27.097
I was gonna need your help,

40:27.099 --> 40:30.401
and that's when you
handed me the journal.

40:30.403 --> 40:33.337
So Lucy, you

40:33.339 --> 40:35.439
- started all of it.
- No, that's impossible.

40:35.441 --> 40:36.784
We can't travel into our own timeline.

40:36.786 --> 40:38.021
Okay, maybe not now,

40:38.024 --> 40:39.617
but maybe one day,

40:39.620 --> 40:41.346
Rufus and Jiya will figure it out.

40:41.349 --> 40:42.425
Wait, what are you
saying? In the future...

40:42.427 --> 40:45.482
I'm saying, you came
up to me in the bar,

40:45.484 --> 40:47.251
you handed me this journal,

40:47.253 --> 40:48.666
and you just left.

40:48.669 --> 40:49.784
But that doesn't make any sense.

40:49.786 --> 40:51.522
Well, Lucy, that's all I know.

40:51.524 --> 40:53.490
The rest, I suppose, you'll have to wait

40:53.492 --> 40:55.059
and see what happens.

40:56.429 --> 40:58.095
We both will.

41:04.170 --> 41:06.270
Hi. What are you looking at?

41:06.272 --> 41:08.539
Um, just my family.

41:08.542 --> 41:10.880
What I'm missing down here.

41:10.896 --> 41:12.557
I don't know how long they're gonna buy

41:12.560 --> 41:15.145
that I'm pouring pints
on an Alaskan cruise ship.

41:15.147 --> 41:18.482
I'm sorry you have to lie.

41:18.484 --> 41:20.184
Who's that?

41:20.186 --> 41:21.251
Kevin.

41:21.253 --> 41:23.187
Kevin who?

41:23.189 --> 41:24.568
Kevin, my brother.

41:24.571 --> 41:26.463
You shoot pool with all the time.

41:30.496 --> 41:32.705
- What?
- Not in my timeline.

41:32.708 --> 41:33.943
What do you mean?

41:33.946 --> 41:36.364
In my timeline, I never met him.

41:37.528 --> 41:39.169
He was, uh...

41:41.474 --> 41:44.441
Very sick as a kid.

41:44.443 --> 41:47.277
He had leukemia.

41:47.279 --> 41:50.214
Jessica, he died before he was three.

41:50.216 --> 41:51.674
No, he didn't, Wyatt.

41:51.677 --> 41:53.451
How'd he get better?

41:55.353 --> 41:59.155
I don't really remember. Um...

41:59.158 --> 42:02.092
Some kind of cutting-edge treatment.

42:02.094 --> 42:04.194
Stem cell or something. I don't know.

42:04.196 --> 42:06.230
And how'd your family get the money?

42:06.232 --> 42:07.908
Can we please not talk about this?

42:07.911 --> 42:09.849
Jess.

42:09.852 --> 42:12.200
Is there something
you're not telling me?

42:15.054 --> 42:16.560
Yeah, there is.

42:21.380 --> 42:22.791
I'm pregnant.
