WEBVTT

00:01.350 --> 00:02.250
Oh, yeah.

00:02.290 --> 00:04.450
I wanna go to Mars
and build a city

00:04.490 --> 00:07.020
so people could live there.

00:07.060 --> 00:08.090
Yeah?
How 'bout you?

00:08.130 --> 00:09.630
What do you wanna be
when you grow up?

00:09.660 --> 00:11.190
I'm going to be a doctor.

00:11.230 --> 00:13.360
I'm going to go overseas
to help refugees.

00:13.400 --> 00:17.200
So everyone's gonna grow up
and leave your old man alone?

00:17.240 --> 00:18.940
Okay, off you go.

00:20.000 --> 00:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:33.650 --> 00:36.490
You won't leave me behind
now, Diglett, will you?

00:36.520 --> 00:37.950
Yeah.

00:44.300 --> 00:47.360
Kids are asleep.

00:47.400 --> 00:49.970
What's my duffel bag
doing there?

00:50.000 --> 00:51.800
I packed some of your things.

00:51.840 --> 00:54.300
Where am I going?

00:54.340 --> 00:56.570
I'll tell the kids
you got called into work.

00:56.610 --> 00:59.410
You can pick up the rest
tomorrow when we're at service.

00:59.450 --> 01:00.280
Hmm.

01:00.310 --> 01:02.950
Tom, I know about
the antibiotics.

01:02.980 --> 01:06.080
There's only one way
you got that infection.

01:06.120 --> 01:09.090
I knew you'd be like this,
go straight to a divorce.

01:09.120 --> 01:10.990
I haven't decided anything yet.

01:11.020 --> 01:11.920
Don't lie.

01:11.960 --> 01:13.790
I saw what you texted
your sister.

01:13.830 --> 01:15.760
I'm getting the kids.

01:16.960 --> 01:18.060
Don't do that.

01:18.100 --> 01:21.470
We're not staying
in this house with you.

01:21.500 --> 01:23.470
What?

01:23.500 --> 01:27.840
Please, I just wanna see
our babies.

01:48.690 --> 01:51.460
Molly, we'll play
that game after church, okay?

01:53.270 --> 01:55.530
Help your sister with the door.

01:57.340 --> 01:58.600
Tom's truck's still
in the driveway.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.100
They're gonna miss the service.

02:00.140 --> 02:01.710
Maybe one of the kids is sick.

02:01.740 --> 02:04.170
Can you go check?
Sure.

02:21.360 --> 02:23.160
Neighbors says it sounded
like a bomb.

02:23.200 --> 02:26.060
The owner, Thomas Gilman,
is a Deportation Officer

02:26.100 --> 02:28.430
for the ICE office
in Port Chester.

02:28.470 --> 02:30.300
We suspect he was the target.

02:30.340 --> 02:31.270
Was he home?

02:31.300 --> 02:32.900
That's his truck
in the driveway.

02:32.940 --> 02:35.540
The Fire Department's
still searching for victims.

02:35.570 --> 02:39.410
We got one neighbor DOA,
two more in the ICU.

02:39.440 --> 02:42.550
Any evidence of a bomb
besides the big noise?

02:42.580 --> 02:45.750
Look at this place.
What else would do this?

02:45.780 --> 02:47.480
Captain, what have we got?

02:47.520 --> 02:50.220
Three bodies: adult female
on a bed over there,

02:50.260 --> 02:53.560
two juveniles.

02:53.590 --> 02:57.830
The Gilmans had two kids;
boy and girl, eight and ten.

02:59.800 --> 03:01.430
Names.

03:01.470 --> 03:03.800
Roy and Mia.

03:03.840 --> 03:04.900
What about Tom Gilman?

03:04.940 --> 03:07.570
Haven't found any other remains.

03:09.110 --> 03:11.270
We got the point of origin
in the basement.

03:11.310 --> 03:13.180
The gas line to the furnace
was pulled out.

03:13.210 --> 03:15.080
We found traces of
a lit candle on the floor

03:15.110 --> 03:16.080
about eight feet away.

03:16.110 --> 03:17.610
The gas accumulated
in the basement,

03:17.650 --> 03:19.880
and when it filled up
and got down to the candle...

03:19.920 --> 03:21.480
The house went up.

03:21.520 --> 03:23.720
Are there any other vehicles
registered to the family?

03:23.760 --> 03:27.390
There's a compact SUV
registered to Connie Gilman,

03:27.430 --> 03:29.560
probably in the garage.

03:32.430 --> 03:34.660
It's gone.

03:34.700 --> 03:35.770
Gilman took it and left his

03:35.800 --> 03:37.970
to make it look like
he was still here.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.140
How long for the gas
to get to the candle?

03:40.170 --> 03:43.410
Rough estimate,
nine to ten hours.

03:43.440 --> 03:45.980
Okay, the house goes up
around 10:15.

03:46.010 --> 03:47.440
That means that Gilman
would have had to

03:47.480 --> 03:49.650
pull the gas line
around midnight.

03:49.680 --> 03:52.420
He's got a 14-hour lead on us.

03:52.450 --> 03:54.580
Westchester ME said
all three victims had

03:54.620 --> 03:55.620
their throats cut.

03:55.650 --> 03:57.220
Mrs. Gilman got
a bonus bullet in the head.

03:57.260 --> 03:58.320
Yeah, a 9-millimeter round.

03:58.360 --> 04:00.690
It's consistent with
a Sig Sauer P320 that

04:00.730 --> 04:02.960
Gilman would have been issued
as an ICE officer.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.730
All right, folks,
thank you for giving up

04:04.760 --> 04:06.000
your Sunday brunch.

04:06.030 --> 04:08.400
Let's push Mr. Gilman's photo
and particulars

04:08.430 --> 04:09.830
through the pipeline
far and wide.

04:09.870 --> 04:11.970
All right?
A family annihilator.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.310
He fits... most of them
are middle-aged, male, white.

04:15.340 --> 04:17.570
Yeah, must be all those
Jimmy Buffett songs.

04:17.610 --> 04:20.940
With a 14-hour lead time,
he could be anywhere by now.

04:20.980 --> 04:22.780
I'm calling the CID for an I-O

04:22.810 --> 04:24.110
to put Gilman on
the Most Wanted.

04:24.150 --> 04:27.550
I want the Fugitive Task Force
on this.

04:27.590 --> 04:30.790
A lot of good people
on that task force.

04:30.820 --> 04:33.520
I know which one I want
leading the hunt.

04:34.530 --> 04:37.690
Dad, does Wally mind the hood?

04:37.730 --> 04:40.560
He's okay, honey.

04:40.600 --> 04:43.670
It's not hurting him.
Keep holding that leash.

05:14.100 --> 05:15.670
I'm proud of you, Tali.

05:25.280 --> 05:28.810
Agent LaCroix.

05:28.850 --> 05:30.910
Yes, I'm on my way.

05:40.160 --> 05:43.930
I'm sorry.
Let's put Wally back.

05:50.070 --> 05:51.900
My name is Isobel Castille,

05:51.940 --> 05:53.570
Assistant Special Agent
in charge of

05:53.610 --> 05:56.170
the New York Fugitive
Task Force.

05:56.210 --> 05:58.070
We are announcing today
the addition of

05:58.110 --> 06:02.710
Thomas Mark Gilman to the FBI's
Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list.

06:02.750 --> 06:04.550
Gilman is wanted for
triple homicide

06:04.580 --> 06:08.520
of his wife Constance Gilman
and their children Mia and Roy.

06:08.550 --> 06:11.150
The FBI Fugitive Task Force
has obtained

06:11.190 --> 06:14.060
a federal arrest warrant
for unlawful flight

06:14.090 --> 06:15.560
to avoid prosecution.

06:15.590 --> 06:19.030
Gilman is considered armed
and extremely dangerous.

06:19.060 --> 06:23.330
Since 1950, 521 fugitives
have been placed

06:23.370 --> 06:25.030
on the Most Wanted list.

06:25.070 --> 06:28.540
Gilman is the 522nd.

06:28.570 --> 06:33.510
Of those fugitives,
486 have been captured,

06:33.550 --> 06:36.510
95% success rate.

06:36.550 --> 06:39.520
Thank you.

06:39.550 --> 06:42.250
Make it 487.

06:44.660 --> 06:46.720
Gilman's been an ICE officer
for ten years.

06:46.760 --> 06:48.120
He knows our bag of tricks.

06:48.160 --> 06:50.060
All this cool whiz-bang stuff
isn't gonna catch him.

06:50.100 --> 06:51.800
So what's your cool stuff,
gut instinct?

06:51.830 --> 06:53.900
I like to educate my gut.
I go backwards.

06:53.930 --> 06:55.000
What's Gilman's story?

06:55.030 --> 06:56.830
Who are his close friends,
family?

06:56.870 --> 06:57.870
Well, his neighbors say that

06:57.900 --> 06:59.170
he doesn't talk about
his family,

06:59.200 --> 07:01.170
but his wife has a sister
in White Plains

07:01.210 --> 07:02.310
that she's close to.

07:02.340 --> 07:04.010
Good, I'll start with her.

07:04.080 --> 07:05.210
But we're going with you.

07:05.240 --> 07:07.610
This is a fugitive case now.
Your job is done.

07:07.650 --> 07:09.910
Really?
I saw those children.

07:09.950 --> 07:12.820
My job is done when
Gilman's in custody.

07:12.850 --> 07:15.690
Jubal will tell you,
I work with a small team,

07:15.720 --> 07:17.750
people who've known me
for years.

07:19.160 --> 07:21.060
Agent LaCroix...

07:21.090 --> 07:22.260
It's nothing personal.

07:22.290 --> 07:24.530
My team has a shorthand,
no wasted motions.

07:24.560 --> 07:25.660
Yeah, I caught one of your talks

07:25.700 --> 07:27.230
in Quantico three years ago.

07:27.270 --> 07:28.570
I know how you work.

07:28.600 --> 07:30.970
Just give me this:

07:31.000 --> 07:33.770
call me for the takedown.

07:33.810 --> 07:35.140
No promises.

07:35.170 --> 07:39.510
You have passion, Agent Bell.
Hold on to it, it's useful.

07:44.780 --> 07:48.050
Sheryll'll join me interviewing
Mrs. Gilman's bereaved sister.

07:48.090 --> 07:49.650
You should try doing that
hand holding bit

07:49.690 --> 07:50.750
by yourself sometime.

07:50.790 --> 07:52.060
My hands are not as soft
as yours.

07:52.090 --> 07:54.190
Clinton, get with
the ICE office in Port Chester.

07:54.230 --> 07:57.130
Tell 'em we want to talk to
Mr. Gilman's co-workers today.

07:57.160 --> 07:58.330
Don't let 'em stall you.

07:58.360 --> 07:59.330
They had a bad apple.

07:59.360 --> 08:01.530
They gotta suck it up
and cooperate.

08:01.570 --> 08:03.000
I'll sweet talk them.

08:03.030 --> 08:05.500
Hana, everyone he spoke to
on the Net,

08:05.540 --> 08:07.740
every site visited,
opinion expressed,

08:07.770 --> 08:09.210
his jollies, his follies...

08:09.240 --> 08:11.070
Yeah, I got it.

08:11.110 --> 08:13.280
Young Agent Crosby,
how are those guns?

08:13.310 --> 08:14.640
All mended?

08:14.680 --> 08:16.350
100%, boss.

08:16.380 --> 08:18.880
Excellent.

08:18.920 --> 08:21.150
Do us a favor.
Next time a fugitive throws

08:21.190 --> 08:22.290
a refrigerator down a staircase,

08:22.320 --> 08:23.420
don't try to catch it.

08:23.460 --> 08:24.490
Copy that.

08:24.520 --> 08:26.960
Now, we all know what
Mr. Gilman did

08:26.990 --> 08:28.490
to get his spot
on the Most Wanted.

08:28.530 --> 08:32.030
Our job is not to bring justice
to Mr. Gilman.

08:32.059 --> 08:35.059
Our job is to bring
Mr. Gilman to justice.

08:44.880 --> 08:47.010
Connie was divorcing him.

08:47.050 --> 08:48.510
She was telling him
Saturday night

08:48.550 --> 08:50.510
she wanted him out
before the kids woke up.

08:50.550 --> 08:52.280
Why did your sister want
a divorce?

08:52.320 --> 08:54.350
She found out he cheated on her.

08:54.390 --> 08:58.120
She found his pills for
a urinary infection.

08:58.160 --> 09:00.190
What was their marriage
like before?

09:00.230 --> 09:02.160
Tom's a control freak,

09:02.190 --> 09:04.830
and Connie was like this
"yes, sir" wife,

09:04.860 --> 09:06.700
and she never stood up
for herself.

09:06.730 --> 09:10.630
But the divorce was
her idea, right?

09:10.670 --> 09:14.770
I told her that she didn't
deserve to be treated...

09:16.040 --> 09:19.180
If I just kept my stupid
mouth shut, none of...

09:19.210 --> 09:21.780
Michelle, this was not
your fault, okay?

09:21.810 --> 09:23.580
And you're doing great work now.

09:23.620 --> 09:25.520
You're giving us
solid information.

09:29.350 --> 09:32.590
Tell us about Tom's family.

09:32.620 --> 09:35.220
Connie said that his mom
ran off when he was young,

09:35.260 --> 09:38.600
and I think his dad passed
three years ago.

09:38.630 --> 09:40.800
And what about his friends,
did you know them?

09:40.830 --> 09:43.170
I don't know if he had any.

09:43.200 --> 09:46.840
He was always off on his own,
playing with the dog.

09:46.870 --> 09:50.670
He barely even talked
to his own kids.

09:54.680 --> 09:56.380
We'll be there in an hour.
Thank you.

09:57.480 --> 09:59.780
Where is he?
Turning up his goodie box.

09:59.820 --> 10:01.420
Hey, boss, I scrubbed
Gilman's phone.

10:01.450 --> 10:02.950
No trace of any girlfriend.

10:02.990 --> 10:04.590
Gilman didn't cheat
because he's looking

10:04.620 --> 10:05.890
for a relationship.

10:05.920 --> 10:07.760
Intimacy's not in his tool kit.
Neither is sharing.

10:07.790 --> 10:09.330
He's got
no social media presence.

10:09.360 --> 10:11.130
Joined Facebook in 2009,

10:11.160 --> 10:12.360
posted one picture of
his daughter,

10:12.400 --> 10:14.630
and hasn't been back since.

10:14.670 --> 10:16.100
Sounds about right.

10:16.130 --> 10:18.970
What's he doing,
inspecting suspicious marbles?

10:19.000 --> 10:21.770
It's old, Detective,
maybe from his childhood.

10:21.810 --> 10:23.810
It's interesting to me
that he kept it.

10:23.840 --> 10:26.110
The ICE office
in Port Chester will have

10:26.140 --> 10:28.340
Gilman's co-workers ready
for us in an hour.

10:28.380 --> 10:29.710
I was just at his bank.

10:29.750 --> 10:31.950
He withdrew 35K
Saturday morning.

10:31.980 --> 10:34.380
Running money.
He had a plan.

10:34.420 --> 10:36.720
Nothing impetuous about our boy.

10:36.760 --> 10:38.990
Sounds like this isn't
your first rodeo

10:39.020 --> 10:40.590
with family annihilators.

10:40.630 --> 10:42.690
You know they come
in four flavors?

10:42.730 --> 10:44.390
There's the self-righteous type
who blames everybody,

10:44.430 --> 10:46.430
especially his wife,
for all the crap in his life.

10:46.460 --> 10:48.600
There's the guy who can't
get his act together

10:48.630 --> 10:51.230
and feels humiliated
by his failures.

10:51.270 --> 10:53.340
And then we have
the self-pitying loser

10:53.370 --> 10:57.440
who feels like his family
has let him down.

10:57.480 --> 11:00.180
Then there's the paranoid fella
who thinks his family's

11:00.210 --> 11:01.840
in danger from
the outside world.

11:01.880 --> 11:05.920
You know, moral decay
or the bogeyman.

11:07.420 --> 11:11.250
So how does he protect them?

11:11.290 --> 11:13.420
He kills his family himself.

11:17.600 --> 11:19.400
I knew Tommy had problems
at home.

11:19.430 --> 11:21.500
Just never imagined
it'd come to this.

11:24.600 --> 11:25.970
He cheated on his wife
with a woman

11:26.000 --> 11:28.040
at a massage parlor
in White Plains,

11:28.070 --> 11:29.940
and he worried his wife
would find out.

11:29.970 --> 11:31.670
So he was afraid of
losing his family?

11:31.710 --> 11:32.910
He was regretful.

11:32.940 --> 11:35.610
He wanted to renew
his commitment to his marriage.

11:35.650 --> 11:36.680
Can you write down the name of

11:36.720 --> 11:39.520
that massage parlor,
if you know it?

11:46.020 --> 11:47.360
You a hunter?

11:47.390 --> 11:50.160
On your keychain,
that's a sight wrench.

11:50.200 --> 11:52.300
Yes, sir, I hunt.

11:52.330 --> 11:53.330
Is Tommy a hunter?

11:53.360 --> 11:55.060
A good one,
and he lets you know it.

11:55.100 --> 11:58.000
He likes to hunt alone.
He can spend days in the woods.

11:58.040 --> 11:59.670
Does he have a favorite spot?

11:59.700 --> 12:02.170
Yeah, but he wouldn't
tell me where.

12:03.110 --> 12:04.540
You said he liked to show off.

12:04.580 --> 12:07.880
I'm sure he sent you
some photos of his hunts.

12:07.910 --> 12:10.480
Sure.

12:17.960 --> 12:21.360
Now, where would
your Fortress of Solitude be?

12:27.930 --> 12:30.370
Survey marker.

12:51.420 --> 12:53.590
Rangers found it two hours ago.

12:53.630 --> 12:55.360
Suspect's probably out hunting.

13:07.040 --> 13:11.210
I'm calling it!
Gilman's not coming back.

13:11.240 --> 13:12.280
That dog's starving.

13:12.310 --> 13:14.610
It's been chewing through
the leash.

13:17.920 --> 13:20.980
Probably hasn't been fed
in three days.

13:21.020 --> 13:22.250
Sir, I don't think we fully...

13:22.290 --> 13:25.350
Gilman staged this
to pin us down here...

13:25.390 --> 13:27.560
Waiting for him.

13:27.590 --> 13:29.760
Here you go, buddy.

13:29.790 --> 13:30.930
Here you go, come on.

13:30.960 --> 13:32.760
Maybe he got injured hunting.

13:32.800 --> 13:34.430
He went hunting without
his rifle?

13:34.470 --> 13:37.370
There's caves nearby.
Maybe he's hiding there.

13:37.400 --> 13:38.770
Yeah, you go search those caves.

13:38.800 --> 13:40.440
That's exactly what
Gilman wants,

13:40.470 --> 13:42.510
wasting our resources.

13:42.540 --> 13:43.670
He's long gone.

13:43.710 --> 13:46.040
He'll be looking for
another mode of transport.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.850
Or maybe he'll grow wings.

13:56.820 --> 13:59.360
Well played, Tommy.

14:01.860 --> 14:04.330
Oscar Perez.

14:04.360 --> 14:06.060
Yep, that's me.

14:06.100 --> 14:10.370
All right, Mr. Perez,
here are your keys.

14:10.400 --> 14:15.070
I'm just gonna take
the plates off.

14:15.110 --> 14:17.870
Don't the plates stay
with the car?

14:17.910 --> 14:21.280
Oh, no, I gotta turn
'em in to the DMV.

14:21.310 --> 14:23.710
Hmm.

14:23.750 --> 14:28.250
Tell you what, why don't you
count this and I'll do that.

14:46.300 --> 14:48.630
<i>Gilman is described as
6'3", 210 pounds</i>

14:48.660 --> 14:50.530
<i>with sandy brown hair
and gray eyes</i>

14:50.570 --> 14:52.970
<i>and a large birthmark
on his right shoulder blade.</i>

14:53.000 --> 14:54.900
- Hot water, boss.
- Thank you.

14:54.940 --> 14:57.200
Mm-hmm.

14:57.240 --> 14:59.040
While I was staring at
the wall back there,

14:59.080 --> 15:01.240
I was thinking about
Gilman's dilemma.

15:01.310 --> 15:03.780
He needs to put miles
on the odometer.

15:03.810 --> 15:06.350
He knows we've got
everything covered.

15:06.380 --> 15:08.850
He would've anticipated having
to change his appearance

15:08.890 --> 15:10.180
and use a fake ID.

15:10.220 --> 15:12.950
Being a deportation officer,
arresting undocumented aliens,

15:12.990 --> 15:15.260
he would have had the pick of
all the fake IDs they had.

15:15.290 --> 15:16.460
Right?
Mm.

15:16.490 --> 15:18.690
I guess we're going back
to Port Chester.

15:18.730 --> 15:19.890
You, Crosby, and Hana.

15:19.930 --> 15:24.030
Sheryll and me, we're going to
a massage parlor.

15:24.070 --> 15:26.170
I couldn't believe
it was the same guy,

15:26.200 --> 15:29.140
but then they said he had
a birthmark on his back.

15:31.110 --> 15:33.140
How can a guy kill his own kids?

15:33.180 --> 15:34.280
Good question.

15:34.310 --> 15:36.840
The booker said Gilman was
your regular client.

15:37.980 --> 15:41.020
Okay, look, I only do
therapeutic oil massage.

15:41.050 --> 15:42.680
Rub, no tug.
Feel me?

15:42.720 --> 15:45.750
I'm feeling the stiletto heels.

15:45.790 --> 15:47.290
Hey, Jules, we're not here
to bust your chops

15:47.320 --> 15:48.420
about your sex work.

15:48.460 --> 15:50.830
We just wanna catch Gilman,
okay?

15:52.830 --> 15:54.900
Tell us what he was like
with you.

15:54.930 --> 15:56.800
He was shy.

15:56.830 --> 15:58.200
First time,
he didn't even take off

15:58.230 --> 15:59.930
his t-shirt and shorts.

15:59.970 --> 16:03.040
He didn't want any extras,
just the massage.

16:03.070 --> 16:05.710
After, he said
he wouldn't be back.

16:05.740 --> 16:08.480
Guess who showed a week later.

16:08.510 --> 16:10.310
He wasn't so shy
the second time.

16:10.350 --> 16:12.050
- You have sex?
- Uh-huh.

16:12.080 --> 16:14.980
He came by every week,
massage then sex.

16:15.020 --> 16:17.380
If I wasn't available,
he'd wait.

16:17.420 --> 16:21.460
Always he'd say that's it;
he was never coming back.

16:21.490 --> 16:23.320
Because he felt guilty?

16:23.360 --> 16:24.560
He said if his wife found out,

16:24.590 --> 16:25.830
he'd lose his family.

16:25.860 --> 16:27.830
But he kept coming back.

16:27.860 --> 16:30.830
He was like, "Why fight it"?

16:30.870 --> 16:32.330
People always leave him anyway.

16:32.370 --> 16:33.770
Yep, like that.

16:35.470 --> 16:38.970
They got a hit on the phony IDs.

16:39.010 --> 16:42.080
By the way, Jules, Gilman
was taking an antibiotic

16:42.110 --> 16:44.410
for an STD, so...

16:45.650 --> 16:46.910
You take care of yourself.

16:53.260 --> 16:54.860
ICE gave us some push-back,

16:54.890 --> 16:56.590
but then they discovered
Gilman stole

16:56.630 --> 16:59.230
a half dozen phony IDs
out of their evidence room.

16:59.260 --> 17:00.490
That must have
been embarrassing.

17:00.530 --> 17:01.530
It sure was.

17:01.560 --> 17:03.660
We put out the names of
those phony IDs.

17:03.700 --> 17:05.500
We got a bounce back from
the State Police.

17:05.540 --> 17:07.640
Detective, you have that
form you showed me?

17:07.670 --> 17:08.940
The victim had it in his pocket.

17:08.970 --> 17:11.010
Appeared he was in the process
of selling his car

17:11.040 --> 17:12.040
to an Oscar Perez.

17:12.069 --> 17:13.839
Matches one of the IDs
Gilman took

17:13.880 --> 17:16.980
from the evidence room.

17:17.010 --> 17:18.210
Any security footage?

17:18.250 --> 17:20.380
This part of the lot's
a bit of a blind spot,

17:20.420 --> 17:22.349
but I got footage of
the victim's car

17:22.390 --> 17:23.849
rolling out at 9:38 last night.

17:23.890 --> 17:26.020
- Seven and half hours ago.
- Mm-hmm.

17:26.060 --> 17:29.260
We're cutting into his lead.

17:29.290 --> 17:31.590
Let's move, guys.

17:31.630 --> 17:33.790
License plate reader picked
up the car on the skyway.

17:33.830 --> 17:36.130
Buffalo PD located it
an hour ago in Kenmore.

17:36.170 --> 17:39.530
I have a team sitting on it.

17:51.210 --> 17:52.210
We did a walk-by.

17:52.250 --> 17:53.750
There's a knapsack
in the backseat.

17:53.780 --> 17:55.750
Doesn't look like Gilman
abandoned the vehicle.

17:55.790 --> 17:57.150
We checked the restaurants here,

17:57.190 --> 17:59.850
and every restaurant, bar,
and motel in both directions.

17:59.890 --> 18:01.120
Well, if not for
the fine dining,

18:01.160 --> 18:02.390
why is he in Buffalo?

18:02.430 --> 18:04.160
Only one reason.
He's getting ready

18:04.190 --> 18:05.660
to cross into Canada.

18:05.700 --> 18:07.490
There's easier places
than Buffalo

18:07.530 --> 18:08.960
to sneak across the border.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.800
Gilman would know those places.

18:10.830 --> 18:12.700
Any massage parlors
along this strip?

18:12.740 --> 18:16.200
There's a couple
a few blocks from here.

18:16.240 --> 18:18.070
He developed a bad habit,

18:18.110 --> 18:19.640
tried to shake it,
but he couldn't.

18:19.680 --> 18:21.710
Let's do it.

18:21.740 --> 18:24.450
You take Crosby and Hana.

18:32.990 --> 18:35.020
Lie down on your stomach.

18:38.030 --> 18:40.260
Thank you for waiting
till I was available.

18:40.300 --> 18:41.800
Mm-hmm.

18:41.830 --> 18:44.000
You're more relaxed
than yesterday.

18:45.570 --> 18:48.070
You took all your clothes off.

18:48.100 --> 18:50.740
Maybe we can play this time.

18:50.770 --> 18:52.810
Mm.

19:00.820 --> 19:03.050
Something wrong?

19:03.090 --> 19:06.450
You just wait here, baby.
I'm gonna go pee.

19:06.490 --> 19:08.320
Don't do that.

19:12.430 --> 19:15.930
FBI.
Have you seen this man?

19:15.970 --> 19:18.100
We're not busting your place.
We just want him.

19:18.130 --> 19:20.300
He came in about 20 minutes ago.

19:20.370 --> 19:22.170
He was here yesterday too.
Is he still here?

19:22.200 --> 19:24.040
Yeah, room two with Anni.

19:24.070 --> 19:25.870
Okay, stay here
and don't make a peep.

19:36.450 --> 19:38.290
Help is on the way, all right?

19:38.320 --> 19:39.750
This is Barnes, request
backup and an ambulance...

19:39.790 --> 19:41.060
- You just hang in there.
- At 2231 Elmwood.

19:41.090 --> 19:42.720
Suspect on the move.
Oh, my God, Anni?

19:42.760 --> 19:43.790
You stay with her.

19:43.830 --> 19:45.460
There's an ambulance on the way.

19:49.970 --> 19:51.800
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey!

20:08.120 --> 20:09.280
He got spooked.

20:09.320 --> 20:11.020
Now he'll head for Canada,
just like he planned.

20:11.050 --> 20:12.180
Oh, yeah?

20:12.220 --> 20:13.550
Well, if that's his plan,
then why would

20:13.590 --> 20:16.260
our Most Wanted fugitive risk
a rubdown here with a girl

20:16.290 --> 20:17.660
that he had to beat
half to death

20:17.690 --> 20:19.860
because she recognized him,
instead of waiting until he got

20:19.890 --> 20:21.460
to a nice Canadian
massage parlor

20:21.500 --> 20:24.000
with nice Canadian girls
who haven't seen his face

20:24.030 --> 20:26.370
plastered all over
their video screens?

20:26.400 --> 20:28.430
Huh?
Hey, Jess.

20:28.470 --> 20:31.440
Okay.

20:31.470 --> 20:33.710
You asked me to check you
when you go low.

20:33.740 --> 20:35.370
That agent was just making
a hypothetical.

20:35.410 --> 20:36.410
You're right, but he committed

20:36.440 --> 20:38.210
to that hypothetical.

20:38.250 --> 20:39.850
My old man bled us dry gambling,

20:39.880 --> 20:41.610
but he taught me once
you commit to a horse,

20:41.650 --> 20:43.220
you cut off other options.

20:43.250 --> 20:45.620
Gilman's been here
two days... two days.

20:45.650 --> 20:47.990
Why?
Something's keeping him here.

20:48.020 --> 20:50.720
- Boss, check it out.
- Yep.

20:50.760 --> 20:51.990
He killed the nav and GPS,

20:52.030 --> 20:54.060
so there's no record
of where he's been.

20:54.100 --> 20:55.360
Or who he met in Buffalo.

20:55.400 --> 20:56.700
There was no one in
the Buffalo area

20:56.730 --> 20:58.560
in his personal contacts.

20:58.600 --> 21:00.330
Maybe it's somebody
he came across

21:00.370 --> 21:02.000
in an ICE investigation.

21:02.040 --> 21:03.570
We need to get back
in their database.

21:03.600 --> 21:05.370
After we caught them with
their thumbs up their butts

21:05.410 --> 21:07.640
about the missing IDs,
that's gonna be a problem.

21:07.680 --> 21:10.280
Yeah, a big problem.

21:11.550 --> 21:13.380
Agent LaCroix,
you got good news for me?

21:13.410 --> 21:14.950
Not yet.
I need a favor.

21:14.980 --> 21:16.720
I need full access to
the ICE database.

21:16.750 --> 21:18.220
Okay, who'd you piss off now?

21:18.250 --> 21:19.790
<i>You must have a pal
you can lean on.</i>

21:19.820 --> 21:21.320
Gilman's racking up
a body count.

21:21.360 --> 21:22.320
He's all torqued up,

21:22.360 --> 21:23.960
killing anybody that
gets in his way.

21:23.990 --> 21:25.460
Yeah, yeah.
I'll mention it.

21:25.490 --> 21:27.960
Thanks.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.560
You and LaCroix,
what's the connection?

21:30.600 --> 21:32.400
We worked
the Haynes Spree Killer case.

21:32.430 --> 21:33.870
What is that, seven years ago?

21:33.900 --> 21:38.570
I was having some trouble
with my sobriety at the time.

21:38.610 --> 21:39.770
He was a help.

21:39.810 --> 21:42.410
And then his wife died,
Angelyne, in Afghanistan.

21:42.440 --> 21:43.710
She was Army Intel.

21:43.740 --> 21:45.740
And Jess went to
a pretty dark place.

21:45.780 --> 21:48.110
They have a daughter together.

21:48.150 --> 21:49.820
Anyway, I helped out
where I could,

21:49.850 --> 21:53.050
but somehow Jess managed

21:53.090 --> 21:55.090
to pull himself out
of that tailspin.

21:57.430 --> 21:59.320
Those are the Cliff Notes.

22:01.360 --> 22:03.700
I don't think I've ever met
an actual FBI agent before.

22:03.730 --> 22:05.960
You don't wanna make it a habit.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.070
So what's this about?

22:07.100 --> 22:08.130
Mr. Venutti,
have you ever met

22:08.170 --> 22:09.270
or talked to this man?

22:09.300 --> 22:10.540
His name's Thomas Gilman.

22:10.570 --> 22:13.140
Maybe you know him as
Oscar Perez.

22:13.170 --> 22:14.540
No, I don't know him.

22:14.580 --> 22:16.740
Mr. Gilman's an Immigration
and Customs officer.

22:16.780 --> 22:19.240
He's suspected of killing
his wife and two children.

22:19.280 --> 22:21.850
That's why I don't follow
the news, too depressing.

22:21.880 --> 22:24.050
So what's this got to do
with me?

22:24.090 --> 22:26.650
Gilman searched a dozen
national databases

22:26.690 --> 22:28.590
for information about you.

22:28.620 --> 22:29.960
Why would he be interested
in me?

22:29.990 --> 22:31.820
Maybe you hired
undocumented workers

22:31.860 --> 22:32.960
or brought them
into the country.

22:32.990 --> 22:35.130
No, no way.
I run a straight business.

22:35.160 --> 22:36.530
You can't think of
any reason why

22:36.560 --> 22:38.400
Gilman has you in his radar?

22:38.430 --> 22:39.670
No.

22:39.700 --> 22:42.300
Look, I got a lot of work
to do, guys, so...

22:42.340 --> 22:43.670
That's a nice-looking family
you got there.

22:43.700 --> 22:45.640
You don't mind taking
one last look at Gilman?

22:45.670 --> 22:48.210
He might have had dark hair
or glasses.

22:49.940 --> 22:51.010
Oh, damn, sorry.

22:51.050 --> 22:52.410
I didn't mean for you
to see that.

22:52.450 --> 22:53.980
That's the wife
when they found her.

22:54.010 --> 22:58.020
Here, that's the kids.

22:58.050 --> 22:59.690
Sorry.
All right.

22:59.720 --> 23:01.090
That's enough, all right?

23:01.120 --> 23:04.260
You guys need to leave.
I'm done.

23:09.200 --> 23:11.200
I didn't mean to upset you.

23:14.770 --> 23:17.040
You didn't break him,
but you sure skeeved him.

23:17.070 --> 23:18.740
He wasn't repulsed.
He was scared.

23:18.770 --> 23:21.170
He knows Gilman.

23:23.210 --> 23:25.140
I time-travelled Venutti
all the way back to

23:25.180 --> 23:26.280
East Buffalo High School.

23:26.310 --> 23:27.880
There's no intersection
with Gilman.

23:27.920 --> 23:30.750
No work history, no clubs,
no church...

23:30.780 --> 23:33.420
How is anybody fooled by these?

23:33.450 --> 23:35.790
These guys don't even look
related to Gilman.

23:35.820 --> 23:36.890
People like to be nice.

23:36.920 --> 23:38.760
They don't like to ask about
pictures on IDs.

23:40.560 --> 23:41.690
The hell was that?

23:41.730 --> 23:43.800
Tali sent me a video
of her feeding a falcon

23:43.830 --> 23:44.930
on her grandparents' farm.

23:44.970 --> 23:47.600
Let me see.

23:47.640 --> 23:49.170
Aw, she's such a sweetie.

23:49.200 --> 23:52.800
She looks more beautiful
every time I see her.

23:52.840 --> 23:55.370
That thing looks like
it's gonna rip her face off.

23:55.410 --> 23:56.510
If you wanna get her a pet bird,

23:56.540 --> 23:57.640
you should try a parakeet.

23:57.680 --> 23:58.910
That's not a pet.
It's a wild animal.

23:58.950 --> 24:00.850
It ran into a high-rise
about three weeks ago.

24:00.880 --> 24:02.280
We'll release it
once it's healthy.

24:02.320 --> 24:05.250
I'm teaching Tali
about falconry.

24:05.290 --> 24:07.590
Well, on that note,

24:07.620 --> 24:09.050
I'm gonna make a run
for some hot wings.

24:09.090 --> 24:11.920
Figured they gotta be
good here, you know, Buffalo.

24:11.960 --> 24:14.490
Any takers?

24:20.470 --> 24:24.200
My sister...

24:24.240 --> 24:27.270
she'd be very proud about how
you're raising Tali.

24:29.110 --> 24:31.080
After Angelyne,
Tali's the only reason

24:31.110 --> 24:32.540
I'm still here.

24:32.580 --> 24:35.080
Even with your parents
to watch over her,

24:35.120 --> 24:38.020
I could never leave her alone.

25:26.600 --> 25:28.700
The same watch.

25:30.870 --> 25:32.470
We need a deep dive on Venutti.

25:32.510 --> 25:35.370
I went deep, so deep I got
his penalty minutes

25:35.410 --> 25:36.810
in JV hockey.

25:36.840 --> 25:38.740
Deeper, I wanna know
the name of the doctor

25:38.780 --> 25:41.910
that pulled him out of
his mother's womb.

25:44.820 --> 25:49.090
Good morning, Mr. Venutti.
We brought you breakfast.

25:49.120 --> 25:51.890
Look, I don't have anything
to say to you guys, okay?

25:51.930 --> 25:54.160
So, please... look, I'm sorry.
I...

25:54.190 --> 25:55.860
We paid good money
for those donuts.

25:55.900 --> 25:57.960
I'm very busy today, okay?
I...

25:58.000 --> 25:59.770
Either you talk to us
about Gilman

25:59.800 --> 26:00.900
or you talk to a judge.

26:00.930 --> 26:02.400
I don't know him, okay?
I don't know him.

26:02.440 --> 26:04.340
So stop harassing me.
Just stop.

26:04.370 --> 26:05.440
Ah!

26:05.470 --> 26:07.440
Look, I don't know him!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

26:07.470 --> 26:09.410
I don't know him!
I don't know him, please!

26:09.440 --> 26:10.510
Breathe.
Hey!

26:10.540 --> 26:11.680
- I don't know him!
- Breathe, Mr. Venutti.

26:11.710 --> 26:14.250
Breathe, breathe.
Listen to us, okay?

26:14.280 --> 26:17.180
We found your name change
when you were six,

26:17.220 --> 26:19.180
and you were adopted by
John Venutti,

26:19.220 --> 26:21.250
the man your mother married
after she ran away

26:21.290 --> 26:23.460
from your real father.

26:25.160 --> 26:26.460
I don't know what
you're talking about.

26:26.490 --> 26:28.360
Look at me, Mr. Venutti.

26:28.400 --> 26:30.800
This is you in Tommy's arms

26:30.830 --> 26:32.260
when he was ten
and you were two.

26:32.300 --> 26:33.400
No, no, I don't...

26:33.430 --> 26:34.800
Look how he's holding you
so you won't fall.

26:34.840 --> 26:38.070
Look how happy you are,
safe in your brother's arms.

26:38.110 --> 26:40.640
Look at the picture,
Mr. Venutti.

26:40.670 --> 26:42.470
Your big brother Tommy.

26:42.510 --> 26:44.310
It's okay.

26:44.350 --> 26:45.910
It's okay.

26:45.950 --> 26:47.850
Stop, please, okay.

26:47.880 --> 26:50.780
Stop.

26:55.420 --> 26:56.660
I swear to God,
I'm not trying to protect him.

26:56.690 --> 26:57.760
I know what he did
to his family.

26:57.790 --> 26:58.820
Did he threaten you?

26:58.860 --> 26:59.960
No, but I don't know what
he was gonna do.

26:59.990 --> 27:01.890
So why'd he contact you?

27:01.930 --> 27:04.200
He wants to know where
our mother is.

27:04.230 --> 27:05.500
What's he want with your mother?

27:05.530 --> 27:09.240
He didn't say, but I know
he wants to hurt her.

27:09.270 --> 27:10.800
Because she abandoned him?

27:10.840 --> 27:12.240
It wasn't her fault,
our father hurt her.

27:12.270 --> 27:13.410
That's why she ran away.

27:13.440 --> 27:15.110
- Without your brother?
- She couldn't take him.

27:15.140 --> 27:17.040
I was five, he was fourteen.

27:17.080 --> 27:19.480
He was afraid to leave
our old man; he stayed.

27:19.510 --> 27:21.050
I mean, the worse part
for Tommy was

27:21.080 --> 27:22.350
she had to hide from
our old man.

27:22.380 --> 27:25.380
So she changed her name,
her social security number.

27:25.420 --> 27:26.450
She had to, though.

27:26.490 --> 27:28.550
Did she or you try
to contact Tommy?

27:28.590 --> 27:31.820
When he turned 18,
she called him.

27:31.860 --> 27:33.760
He blamed her for ruining
the family.

27:33.800 --> 27:37.830
He spewed all this hate at her.
She was afraid.

27:37.870 --> 27:39.930
But she made me promise
to keep trying,

27:39.970 --> 27:41.370
to reach out to him.

27:41.400 --> 27:43.200
I sent him cards
for his birthday.

27:43.240 --> 27:44.900
They always came back
undelivered.

27:44.940 --> 27:46.840
There was nothing
until two days ago

27:46.870 --> 27:49.540
when he showed up at my house.

27:49.580 --> 27:53.010
Our parents' divorce,
it just broke him.

27:53.050 --> 27:54.710
What did you tell Tommy
about your mother?

27:54.750 --> 27:57.750
I told him the truth:
she's dead from a brain tumor,

27:57.790 --> 27:59.050
two months ago.

27:59.090 --> 28:00.220
He didn't wanna believe me.

28:00.250 --> 28:01.420
He thought you were
protecting her.

28:01.460 --> 28:02.560
Yeah.

28:02.590 --> 28:04.020
I told him, "Look, she's buried
at St. Veronica's

28:04.060 --> 28:05.890
"outside Rochester
with my stepfather.

28:05.930 --> 28:06.830
You can go look."

28:06.860 --> 28:07.790
So he'll go to the cemetery

28:07.830 --> 28:08.890
and see you're telling
the truth.

28:08.930 --> 28:11.160
No, there's no headstone
for her.

28:11.200 --> 28:12.530
I haven't had a chance
to get one.

28:12.570 --> 28:14.300
I haven't even had a chance
to empty out her house.

28:14.340 --> 28:17.800
You have to understand
Tommy's gonna come back at me.

28:17.840 --> 28:19.570
Okay?
I know it.

28:19.610 --> 28:20.870
You have any way
of contacting him?

28:20.910 --> 28:22.640
No, he called me once,

28:22.680 --> 28:25.440
but there was
an unknown caller ID.

28:25.480 --> 28:27.280
We can find that number.

28:27.320 --> 28:29.050
What are you gonna do
when you find him?

28:29.080 --> 28:30.250
That's up to him.

28:30.280 --> 28:31.720
You gotta promise me
you're not gonna hurt him.

28:31.750 --> 28:33.320
Okay?

28:33.350 --> 28:37.020
Who he is, what he's done...

28:37.060 --> 28:40.890
he wasn't always like that.

28:56.840 --> 28:58.210
Hey.

28:58.250 --> 29:01.150
Hey, buddy,
is there a Raquel Venutti

29:01.180 --> 29:03.020
buried here next to her husband?

29:03.050 --> 29:04.850
I don't see a marker.

29:04.890 --> 29:06.650
Would have been buried
about two months ago.

29:06.690 --> 29:09.390
Check the church office.
Come back when they're open.

29:09.420 --> 29:11.860
Well, how 'bout you
come over here

29:11.890 --> 29:14.190
and you tell me if there's
a gravesite there.

29:14.230 --> 29:15.360
It's easy, man.

29:15.400 --> 29:17.760
I gotta work.
Come back tomorrow.

29:19.600 --> 29:21.070
Come back tomorrow...

29:21.100 --> 29:22.940
Hey, hey, hey!
Put that down!

29:22.970 --> 29:24.600
Shut up.

29:32.580 --> 29:35.680
What are you looking at?

29:38.950 --> 29:42.050
Stop!

29:42.090 --> 29:44.920
Hey, stop.

29:57.270 --> 29:59.540
Witnesses say Gilman got
into an altercation with

29:59.570 --> 30:02.040
the custodian when he couldn't
find his mother's grave,

30:02.080 --> 30:03.880
stole a pickaxe and went kinetic

30:03.910 --> 30:05.640
on her husband's headstone.

30:05.680 --> 30:08.180
Of course, the man he blames
for stealing his mommy

30:08.220 --> 30:09.380
away from him.

30:09.420 --> 30:11.150
Just imagine what he would
have done to his mother.

30:11.190 --> 30:12.820
Or might still wanna do.

30:12.850 --> 30:15.720
He has no proof that she's dead.

30:15.760 --> 30:17.820
And I'm sure he wants
to believe she's alive

30:17.860 --> 30:19.330
so he can punish her.

30:21.600 --> 30:24.130
So let's give him his wish.

30:26.170 --> 30:27.800
I already told him
that she's dead,

30:27.840 --> 30:29.600
and he doesn't even know
where she lived.

30:29.640 --> 30:31.040
You'll give him the address
when you call him.

30:31.070 --> 30:33.040
You'll say you lied about
her being dead to protect her.

30:33.070 --> 30:35.710
I already told you.
I don't have a contact for him.

30:35.740 --> 30:37.580
We got his number from
the call he made to you.

30:37.610 --> 30:38.810
He's been turning his phone
on and off

30:38.850 --> 30:40.250
so we're not able to track him.

30:40.280 --> 30:41.910
But as soon as he turns it
back on...

30:41.950 --> 30:43.320
Why would he believe me?

30:43.350 --> 30:45.720
Because he's already
halfway there.

30:45.750 --> 30:47.990
He wants to believe it.

30:50.560 --> 30:54.890
Look, I understand why
he was so upset with my mom.

30:54.930 --> 30:59.600
I just wish...

30:59.630 --> 31:01.270
I wish that he would have
given her a chance

31:01.300 --> 31:03.040
while she was alive.

31:03.070 --> 31:06.370
She wasn't this awful person.

31:06.410 --> 31:07.840
I wanna...

31:07.880 --> 31:10.180
I wanna show you something.

31:13.080 --> 31:15.310
Here, this is from last October.

31:15.350 --> 31:17.020
She just turned 72.

31:17.050 --> 31:19.750
<i>Thank you so much.
It's such a beautiful cake.</i>

31:19.790 --> 31:21.550
<i>All right, make a wish, Mom.</i>

31:21.590 --> 31:23.560
<i>I wish...</i>

31:23.590 --> 31:26.790
<i>I'm so sorry... so sorry.</i>

31:26.830 --> 31:27.960
<i>It's all right.</i>

31:28.000 --> 31:32.830
<i>That Grandpa and Tommy, my Tommy</i>

31:32.870 --> 31:34.630
<i>can't be here.</i>

31:34.670 --> 31:35.730
See?

31:35.770 --> 31:38.070
She never really got over
leaving Tommy behind.

31:39.070 --> 31:41.570
His phone's back on.

31:43.480 --> 31:46.810
Mr. Venutti, please.

32:00.530 --> 32:01.630
Hey, Tommy.

32:01.660 --> 32:04.030
You lied to me, Mikey.
There's no grave.

32:04.070 --> 32:05.760
I'm sorry, Tommy.
I didn't mean to lie.

32:05.800 --> 32:07.270
It's just that
you were so mad at Mom.

32:07.300 --> 32:08.500
Yeah, wouldn't you be?

32:08.540 --> 32:10.670
She left me behind.
I was just a kid.

32:10.710 --> 32:12.910
<i>Now, where is she, Mikey?</i>

32:14.440 --> 32:16.210
Where is she, Mikey?

32:18.380 --> 32:22.110
4890 Hardt Road in East Eden.

32:22.150 --> 32:23.650
Now listen, I'm gonna find it,

32:23.680 --> 32:24.650
but you stay away.

32:24.690 --> 32:27.550
<i>Do you understand me?</i>

32:27.590 --> 32:29.360
Tommy, listen to me,
she's dead, okay?

32:29.390 --> 32:30.890
Don't go!
Don't go, it's a trap!

32:30.930 --> 32:32.460
Listen, Mom's dead.
Tommy!

32:32.490 --> 32:34.660
<i>Don't go!</i>

32:34.700 --> 32:36.030
Tommy!

32:38.400 --> 32:40.370
He's my brother.

32:40.400 --> 32:42.570
He protected me from our father.

32:42.600 --> 32:45.670
He took the beatings
that were meant for me.

32:45.710 --> 32:49.110
I can't do that to him.
Do you understand?

32:49.140 --> 32:51.980
I'm sorry.

32:52.010 --> 32:54.110
Gilman turned his phone off.

32:56.380 --> 32:57.620
He'll be in the wind.

32:57.650 --> 32:58.980
Nothing's holding him here
anymore.

32:59.020 --> 33:02.290
Except he wants his mom
to be alive.

33:02.320 --> 33:04.890
We're taking
that birthday video.

33:14.410 --> 33:15.780
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

33:20.480 --> 33:23.120
Gilman's turning his phone
on and off every hour or so.

33:23.150 --> 33:24.280
He's heading west.

33:24.320 --> 33:25.990
We need to be ready,
soon as he pings a tower.

33:26.020 --> 33:28.050
You hear that, Scorsese?
Cut faster.

33:28.090 --> 33:30.760
Just got the CCTV footage
from outside the cemetery.

33:30.790 --> 33:32.590
This is where we needed
a Scorsese,

33:32.630 --> 33:34.530
to get an angle on that
license plate.

33:34.560 --> 33:35.760
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

33:35.800 --> 33:37.230
I still can't believe
Venutti boned us like that.

33:37.270 --> 33:38.800
Blood is thicker.

33:38.830 --> 33:39.970
So is guilt.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.230
He got the good life,
while the brother he loved

33:41.270 --> 33:43.270
got to be a punch bag
for their dad.

33:43.310 --> 33:45.240
<i>Can't be here.</i>

33:47.080 --> 33:48.680
Jess LaCroix.

33:48.710 --> 33:52.310
We're just outside Buffalo.
How quick can you get here?

33:52.350 --> 33:54.480
<i>And this cold front is
showing no sign</i>

33:54.520 --> 33:56.320
<i>of slowing up
for the next 24 hours.</i>

33:56.350 --> 33:58.450
<i>Snow and high winds
are expected to sweep</i>

33:58.490 --> 34:00.820
<i>through Buffalo
and parts of Lewis County</i>

34:00.860 --> 34:03.820
<i>with possible accumulations
of six to ten inches.</i>

34:03.860 --> 34:05.530
<i>Across the higher terrains...</i>

34:12.570 --> 34:15.199
<i>Travel will be difficult
with this winter weather...</i>

34:18.670 --> 34:21.570
<i>So make sure you slow down
and use caution while driving.</i>

34:21.610 --> 34:25.210
<i>And in other news,
the city of Fair Haven...</i>

34:25.250 --> 34:26.909
Oh, come on.

34:30.020 --> 34:31.380
Yeah, who's this?

34:31.420 --> 34:33.449
<i>Tommy.</i>

34:33.489 --> 34:34.920
Mom?

34:34.960 --> 34:37.820
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

34:37.860 --> 34:41.290
Hey, is that...
Is that really you?

34:42.659 --> 34:45.800
<i>My Tommy, so sorry.</i>

34:45.830 --> 34:47.929
Mom?

34:49.040 --> 34:50.670
No, no, no.
Mom?

34:50.710 --> 34:52.440
Hey, hey, hey, Mom!

34:55.280 --> 34:57.640
Mom?

35:20.940 --> 35:22.940
He just pinged a tower.

35:22.970 --> 35:24.440
He's heading east.

35:24.470 --> 35:25.970
<i>He turned around.</i>

35:26.010 --> 35:29.310
- He took the bait.
- Nice work, Agent Crosby.

35:38.250 --> 35:41.590
Agent LaCroix, my team is
briefed and ready to deploy.

35:41.620 --> 35:42.720
Very good.

35:42.760 --> 35:45.260
He have a 30-acre farm here
with a trained,

35:45.290 --> 35:46.730
resourceful, violent character.

35:46.760 --> 35:49.000
Better we find him
before he finds us.

35:49.030 --> 35:50.230
Mercy's not our business,

35:50.270 --> 35:52.370
but we'll take him alive
if we can.

35:52.400 --> 35:55.200
There's no satisfaction for us
or for the families

35:55.240 --> 35:57.800
in dumping a corpse
in front of a judge.

35:57.840 --> 35:59.570
- Understood?
- Understood.

35:59.610 --> 36:00.870
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

36:00.910 --> 36:02.080
Go, move!
Move out.

36:09.120 --> 36:11.020
Cutting it close, Agent Bell.

36:11.050 --> 36:12.750
Let's go then.

36:24.130 --> 36:28.370
<i>- Spotter, status update.
- Negative... no thermal.</i>

36:35.340 --> 36:37.110
I'm glad Jubal let you come.

36:37.150 --> 36:39.110
Was I supposed to tell him?

36:43.220 --> 36:44.750
It's Gilman.

36:44.790 --> 36:46.650
It's him.
Let's go.

37:26.900 --> 37:29.130
Show me your hands.

37:29.160 --> 37:32.000
I said show me your hands.

37:32.030 --> 37:36.670
Move towards me.
Move towards me.

37:45.450 --> 37:46.810
Mr. Venutti...

37:46.850 --> 37:49.420
I won't let you kill him.

37:49.450 --> 37:51.150
You can't be in here.

38:09.540 --> 38:11.040
Jess?

38:14.940 --> 38:18.650
No!
I'm not gonna let you hurt him!

38:20.180 --> 38:21.450
I got him protected.
Get away!

38:21.480 --> 38:22.820
- Hey, hey...
- You get away!

38:22.850 --> 38:23.980
Easy, easy.
It's okay.

38:24.020 --> 38:25.950
It's okay.
It's me, it's me.

38:25.990 --> 38:27.650
It's okay.
Put the gun down.

38:27.690 --> 38:31.060
Put the gun down.
It's okay, it's me.

38:31.090 --> 38:33.260
Take your best shot.
You earned it.

38:33.300 --> 38:35.190
I'm not armed.

38:35.230 --> 38:38.260
My gun dropped when I took
a header down the stairs.

38:38.300 --> 38:40.100
Tommy, just talk to me.
Put the gun down, Tommy.

38:40.140 --> 38:42.770
- Tell me what you want.
- Can't get what I want.

38:42.800 --> 38:45.170
She's not coming back, is she?
She's dead, isn't she?

38:45.210 --> 38:46.540
I told you she was dead.

38:46.570 --> 38:47.870
No one deserves
to go through what

38:47.910 --> 38:49.310
P your mother put you through,
Tommy.

38:49.340 --> 38:52.410
Nobody.
She left me with a lunatic.

38:52.450 --> 38:55.010
He did to me everything
he wanted to do to her.

38:55.050 --> 38:56.580
But I'm gonna finish it.

38:56.620 --> 39:00.590
This whole miserable family,
I'm gonna finish it.

39:00.620 --> 39:02.220
Shut up!
Shut up!

39:02.260 --> 39:05.790
Hey, hey, you tell them to
stand down right now!

39:05.830 --> 39:07.660
Everybody hold positions!

39:10.000 --> 39:13.270
Please, please, please,
please, please...

39:13.300 --> 39:15.030
- Shut up.
- I'm sorry.

39:15.070 --> 39:17.040
Shut up.

39:21.410 --> 39:24.740
Come on, Tommy.
Look at your kid brother.

39:24.780 --> 39:26.250
<i>He doesn't want you to get hurt.</i>

39:26.280 --> 39:28.650
I've got no shot on the target.

39:28.680 --> 39:29.880
<i>You hear me, brother?</i>

39:29.920 --> 39:32.920
If you die, Tommy,
who's gonna tell your story?

39:32.950 --> 39:35.590
Who's gonna say what
your parents did to you?

39:35.620 --> 39:36.690
Huh?

39:36.730 --> 39:39.390
If you die here,
you're just gonna be remembered

39:39.430 --> 39:43.200
as a... as a monster,
instead of what you are,

39:43.230 --> 39:46.600
which is a wounded kid
alone in the world.

39:48.900 --> 39:52.240
That's as clear to me
as the bottles on that shelf.

39:53.140 --> 39:55.640
- Got it.
- I'll make a lateral.

39:55.680 --> 39:58.180
Oh, Tommy, listen to him.
Okay?

39:58.210 --> 40:00.410
Don't sell yourself short,
Tommy.

40:00.450 --> 40:02.250
He wants the shortie.

40:03.790 --> 40:05.550
I know you regret the situation.

40:05.590 --> 40:07.890
<i>I saw the pictures of your kids.</i>

40:07.920 --> 40:10.890
- It's okay, it's okay.
- My kids loved me so much.

40:10.930 --> 40:12.590
I know, Tommy.

40:12.630 --> 40:16.830
Come on, Tommy.
What are you thinking?

40:16.870 --> 40:19.130
Talk to me!
There's no point.

40:19.170 --> 40:22.400
Nobody ever stands up for me.
That's not true, Tommy.

40:22.440 --> 40:23.700
That's not true, I'm right here.

40:23.740 --> 40:25.070
- They always leave me behind.
- I'm your brother.

40:25.110 --> 40:27.370
I'm right here, Tommy.
I know.

40:27.410 --> 40:29.980
Sending it now.

40:51.930 --> 40:53.670
Fugitive down.
We need a medic here.

40:53.700 --> 40:55.900
<i>Copy that.
Thank you.</i>

41:02.610 --> 41:04.810
- Mr. Gilman...
- Let's go.

41:04.850 --> 41:06.180
You're under arrest pursuant to

41:06.210 --> 41:07.780
a federal fugitive warrant.

41:18.960 --> 41:21.990
- Step.
- Watch your step.

41:22.030 --> 41:24.100
- Good throw.
- Good catch.

41:25.270 --> 41:27.670
We'll clean it up from here.

41:27.700 --> 41:29.900
Maybe we'll do this again
sometime.

41:29.940 --> 41:32.410
Yeah, maybe so.

41:32.440 --> 41:36.110
Hey, thanks for reaching out.

41:36.140 --> 41:37.380
Of course.

41:46.820 --> 41:49.320
You know...

41:49.360 --> 41:52.230
back in the cellar,

41:52.260 --> 41:56.300
you really sounded like you had
compassion for Gilman.

41:58.700 --> 42:02.640
I mean...

42:03.870 --> 42:06.810
like you really felt his pain.

42:09.840 --> 42:12.550
I did feel his pain.
