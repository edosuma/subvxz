Previous on Boston Legal.

00:04.533 --> 00:09.874
- I can't defend a man who raped and murdered
a 13-year-old. - I got Al DS, Denny Crane.

00:09.972 --> 00:12.910
She could've had a lot of suffering' ahead
'cause I really went to town.

00:13.009 --> 00:14.773
She's probably lucky
I ended it quick.

00:14.876 --> 00:17.107
- On the other hand-
- What the-

00:17.210 --> 00:20.546
You're entitled, as a criminal defense
attorney, to shoot someone?

00:20.646 --> 00:22.774
No, no, no, no, no.
Self-defense.

00:22.881 --> 00:26.114
- Night terrors?
- How would you feel about sleeping with me?

00:26.216 --> 00:29.211
It’s just to make sure I don't
leap off the 14th floor.

00:29.319 --> 00:31.881
You'll do anything
to get me into bed.

00:50.301 --> 00:53.032
Denny Crane.

00:53.137 --> 00:55.732
Denny Crane.

00:55.839 --> 00:58.605
Denny Crane.

01:13.819 --> 01:16.984
Oh! Hey!

01:17.087 --> 01:19.455
- Hey!
- What the hell did you-

01:19.556 --> 01:22.584
- Get up, Denny. We're going' to the bathroom.
- Untie the knot.

01:22.691 --> 01:24.924
It takes too long.
Now just get up.

01:25.028 --> 01:28.591
- I'm not getting up.
- It'll take two seconds.

01:28.696 --> 01:31.759
- It's the middle of the night!
- Just get up!

01:31.866 --> 01:35.463
- I'm not going to get up.
- Damn it!

01:39.438 --> 01:41.464
Happy?

01:46.309 --> 01:48.279
This isn't working for me.

02:20.367 --> 02:23.396
I was thinking if develop
some kind of rip cord...

02:23.504 --> 02:25.496
I could free myself
with one little tug...

02:25.605 --> 02:27.506
and you, therefore,
wouldn't be...

02:27.606 --> 02:29.701
inconvenienced
by my nocturnal bladder.

02:29.808 --> 02:31.710
I've been sleeping
with you a week.

02:31.810 --> 02:34.541
I haven't noticed
one night terror.

02:34.644 --> 02:38.174
That's because I feel so comforted nestled
in the safety of your bosom.

02:38.280 --> 02:41.342
- Ch-Change, please?
- That's what this is all about, isn't it? My breasts.

02:41.449 --> 02:43.477
You're lactating. Admit it.

02:45.286 --> 02:47.482
Hey!

02:49.222 --> 02:51.715
If you don't want to give me
no change, that's fine.

02:51.825 --> 02:55.524
- But how about the courtesy of response?
- You want a response?

02:59.064 --> 03:01.625
- Denny, what the hell do you think-
- Relax. Paintball.

03:05.835 --> 03:08.670
Denny Crane.

03:15.475 --> 03:19.938
- You don't have to do this.
- You've been telling me for three days I don't have to do this.

03:20.045 --> 03:23.380
- It’s just that, uh-
- It's your birthday present. I want to.

03:23.480 --> 03:25.848
A bedroom set is more
than a birthday present.

03:25.949 --> 03:29.410
- Okay. Could we just stop arguing about this?
- Can I get a toy?

03:29.519 --> 03:32.183
- No, Tito. We're not here for toys.
- May I help you?

03:32.287 --> 03:34.257
Uh, yeah. We're looking
for bedroom furniture.

03:34.356 --> 03:36.655
- Second floor.
- Thank you.

03:36.757 --> 03:40.822
You know, Denise, what I'd
really like is a picture frame.

03:40.928 --> 03:42.897
Oh, this is beautiful.

03:42.996 --> 03:47.663
We came here to buy a bed. We came here
to buy a dresser. We came here to buy lamps.

03:47.765 --> 03:51.363
We are not leaving here
with just a picture frame...

03:51.468 --> 03:53.369
even though this is
really beautiful.

03:53.469 --> 03:55.531
Can I buy you
the picture frame?

03:55.639 --> 03:58.404
You have a really hard time
accepting gifts, don’t you?

03:58.506 --> 04:02.070
A gift like
a whole bedroom, yes.

04:02.178 --> 04:05.148
All right, second floor, lady.
Let's do it.

04:08.114 --> 04:10.881
Tito!

04:10.983 --> 04:13.578
- Tito!
- Where is he?

04:15.318 --> 04:17.687
- Have you seen my son?
- Mm-mom.

04:17.788 --> 04:22.091
- He's got to be here. He was here just a minute ago.
- Tito!

04:23.192 --> 04:25.527
Tito!

04:25.627 --> 04:29.190
Hey! I'm looking for
a little boy, four years old!

04:29.296 --> 04:32.427
He's wearing a red and gray
jacket and jeans!

04:32.532 --> 04:34.694
- Tito!
- Anyone?

04:34.800 --> 04:37.600
No. No, I haven't.

04:39.171 --> 04:40.799
Tito!

04:58.483 --> 05:01.546
You're sure that's him?

05:01.653 --> 05:03.554
- Positive. His name is Tito.
- Oh, my God.

05:03.654 --> 05:06.785
Please, God.
Please, God.

05:08.692 --> 05:10.889
- Did you get a plate number?
- Partial.

05:10.994 --> 05:14.057
He has my son!
He has my son!

05:14.164 --> 05:16.599
- Talk to you a second?
- Yeah.

05:16.698 --> 05:18.667
It's okay.

05:26.938 --> 05:29.273
The F. B. I.
will be assuming jurisdiction.

05:29.374 --> 05:32.368
- Which means what? You're off?
- We're not off.

05:32.476 --> 05:34.502
This woman is-

05:35.713 --> 05:37.909
My housekeeper.

05:38.014 --> 05:40.951
Denise, look,
we know who took the boy.

05:41.049 --> 05:43.246
- You do?
- Name is Joe Martini.

05:43.351 --> 05:47.518
Don't know where he is, but good news is we
at least know who we're dealing with.

05:47.621 --> 05:51.856
Bad news is he kidnapped
a five-year-old two years ago.

05:51.957 --> 05:54.257
The child
turned up deceased.

05:54.359 --> 05:56.521
Mr. Martini's a pedophile.

05:59.763 --> 06:02.962
- D-Does he have an address?
- He drifts. Occasionally visits his brother.

06:03.065 --> 06:05.001
We've already sent
some uniforms to question.

06:05.101 --> 06:08.937
- Why isn't this man in prison? If you
know who he is- - He was arrested...

06:09.036 --> 06:11.599
but we couldn't
make the case.

06:42.628 --> 06:45.393
- Denny Crane?
- Denny Crane.

06:45.496 --> 06:47.363
- You shot me.
- I did.

06:47.464 --> 06:49.194
- You the big lawyer?
- I am.

06:49.301 --> 06:51.236
- What's going on?
- I could take you to court for assault.

06:51.334 --> 06:54.670
- Sue me.
- But I'm willing to settle. Give me $1 OO, OOO.

06:54.771 --> 06:57.833
Seems a little high. How about zip?
Does zip work for you?

06:57.939 --> 07:01.400
- I may be homeless, but I isn’t stupid.
- My mistake.

07:03.410 --> 07:05.379
I'll be back.

07:09.348 --> 07:12.512
Denny, I could be wrong, but you might
want to think about settling this.

07:12.616 --> 07:14.848
You're absolutely right.

07:14.951 --> 07:17.649
You could be wrong.

07:20.655 --> 07:23.183
Brad, the guy's a pedophile.

07:23.292 --> 07:27.321
- The first 48 hours, if we don't-
- What are the police saying?

07:27.427 --> 07:30.922
They know who he is. They don't know
where he is. Apparently the F. B. I...

07:31.031 --> 07:33.728
is all over it,
but this is an Hispanic kid.

07:33.832 --> 07:36.860
It's not like the news is going to
make a big deal obit.

07:38.203 --> 07:42.437
- I hear that you have friends in the F. B. I.
- I do.

07:42.538 --> 07:46.171
Can you help?
Please?

07:46.276 --> 07:48.245
The first 48 hours.

07:49.510 --> 07:51.537
We think the brother
knows where he is.

07:51.646 --> 07:53.740
- But?
- He's not talking.

07:53.847 --> 07:56.841
Can’t you charge him with conspiracy?
Aiding and abetting?

07:56.949 --> 07:59.648
His only crime is being fraternally related
to the kidnapper.

07:59.752 --> 08:02.483
- We can't exactly-
- What about harboring a fugitive?

08:02.586 --> 08:05.056
No evidence that the suspect
was there after the crime.

08:05.155 --> 08:07.091
So what you’re saying
is your nowhere?

08:07.191 --> 08:10.720
Look, uh, we're on this,
sun’s the Boston P. D...

08:10.826 --> 08:12.921
but, uh, take a walk?

08:14.395 --> 08:16.627
- You can talk in front of me.
- She's good.

08:18.265 --> 08:21.168
Anything the F. B. I. or the police do,
it's state action.

08:21.268 --> 08:23.965
We have limitations.
What a private citizen does, however...

08:24.069 --> 08:28.237
no poisonous fruit issues,
no civil rights concerns.

08:28.340 --> 08:31.277
A child is missing.
If you could be a little less cryptic.

08:31.376 --> 08:33.845
A lot of kids who live
in cults, for example...

08:36.846 --> 08:40.909
Technically, it's a crime.
Are these parents ever prosecuted? No.

08:44.183 --> 08:47.987
Legally, that was false imprisonment.
Did we prosecute? No.

08:48.087 --> 08:51.491
- Is he being less cryptic?
- Self-help.

08:51.590 --> 08:53.752
That brother
knows something.

08:53.858 --> 08:56.055
I know he knows something.

08:56.160 --> 08:58.858
I few weren't
under such scrutiny...

08:58.962 --> 09:01.990
we'd grab him ourselves and,
uh, encourage him a little.

09:04.099 --> 09:08.402
I never saw you take that badge out of
my desk drawer. Never saw you take that one.

09:08.502 --> 09:12.498
Wait. Wait, wait. Are you suggesting that
we impersonate F. B. I. officials?

09:12.605 --> 09:15.508
I would never suggest that.

09:28.650 --> 09:30.915
- He's back?
- In the conference room with a lawyer.

09:31.018 --> 09:33.353
- You, kid.
- Yes, sir?

09:33.454 --> 09:36.288
Fix my tie.
Get in the conference room.

09:36.389 --> 09:40.124
Sit there quietly. Pretend you know something.
You, you know my name?

09:40.226 --> 09:42.127
- Yes, sir.
- Maybe one day I'll know yours.

09:42.227 --> 09:44.891
In the conference room
with Goober. No talking.

09:44.996 --> 09:48.958
- Denny, why don't I join you?
- Why not? Show of force.

09:49.065 --> 09:53.232
Paul, Shirley, join me in the conference room
for a second, will you? Won't take long.

09:53.336 --> 09:55.271
- What's going on?
- Please.

10:08.414 --> 10:13.980
- Who the hell are you?
- Uh, my name is Warren Peters, sir...

10:14.083 --> 10:16.053
and I represent my client
Randall Kirk.

10:16.152 --> 10:17.984
You work for a norm, Warren?

10:18.086 --> 10:20.283
Well, actually,
I'm a solo practitioner.

10:20.389 --> 10:23.657
Gee.
As you can see, I'm not.

10:23.758 --> 10:27.355
I work for a firm, one of the largest in Boston,
dripping with talent.

10:27.461 --> 10:32.129
This is Paul Lewiston.
Right here beside him, Shirley Schmidt.

10:32.231 --> 10:34.894
- Heard of them?
- Yes.

10:34.999 --> 10:38.699
- What's my name?
- Uh, Denny Crane.

10:38.802 --> 10:41.671
I realize you're
a powerful man, sir...

10:41.771 --> 10:44.674
but that does not give you
the right to shoot homeless people.

10:44.773 --> 10:47.801
You-
You shot this man?

10:47.908 --> 10:50.310
Yeah, paintball.
It happens.

10:50.411 --> 10:55.010
Your client tell you that
he first hit me on the head with a rock?

10:55.114 --> 10:59.178
No. He tossed a stone in your direction
which inadvertently struck you.

11:00.319 --> 11:02.220
Well, obviously
I'm not going to pay, son.

11:02.320 --> 11:05.690
So you can spend the next three years
of your life in discovery...

11:05.789 --> 11:07.985
tying to push this case to court,
at which point...

11:08.090 --> 11:10.856
I'll call the clerk and have it
assigned to a friend of mine.

11:10.959 --> 11:12.861
I'm friends with
lots of judges.

11:12.961 --> 11:16.421
Or you can
cut your losses now.

11:16.529 --> 11:18.499
You might want
to think about this.

11:18.598 --> 11:20.568
No other lawyer
would take the case.

11:20.666 --> 11:24.764
The reason they wouldn’t take it
is 'cause it's a money loser.

11:24.869 --> 11:28.069
It's what we call a dog.
You like dog cases, kid?

11:28.172 --> 11:30.165
I'm not intimidated.

11:30.274 --> 11:33.872
Of course you are.

11:33.977 --> 11:38.040
Here's what you need to know
about the practice of law, son.

11:38.145 --> 11:40.206
It all comes down
to money.

11:40.314 --> 11:42.181
I've got it. He doesn't.
I'll win.

11:46.684 --> 11:48.655
Denny Crane.

12:03.365 --> 12:06.894
- Why aren't they doing anything?
- They are, Helena. It’s just-

12:07.001 --> 12:09.563
They could set up roadblocks.
Somebody's got to do something!

12:09.669 --> 12:15.042
The police are all over this.
It’s just they don’t know where this man is.

12:22.078 --> 12:25.414
- What about the police?
- As long as we don't cause any physical injuries, we're okay.

12:25.515 --> 12:27.814
- Will this man be armed?
- We expect not.

12:27.916 --> 12:31.013
He has no record, no history of violence,
but be readjust the same.

12:31.119 --> 12:33.749
Hopefully he'll talk.
If not, we got a room in the basement...

12:33.854 --> 12:35.755
looks like an F. B. I.
interrogation cell.

12:35.855 --> 12:40.158
- Blindfold him. Take him there.
- Brad, you're not going to go all Man nix on us, are you?

12:40.258 --> 12:42.285
I never did that.

12:42.394 --> 12:44.795
I'll meet you downstairs.
Let's go.

12:51.099 --> 12:53.399
What did he mean,
"go all Man nix?"

12:54.735 --> 12:58.605
When I was a kid, my role model
was sort of Man nix.

12:58.704 --> 13:01.733
- The famous private detective?
- He was a television character.

13:01.840 --> 13:05.334
- I'll let you know how we do.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm coming with you.

13:05.443 --> 13:08.279
No, you're not. There's no reason
for both of us to risk our careers.

13:08.379 --> 13:10.815
- There's no way I'm letting you do this alone.
- I have experience-

13:10.914 --> 13:13.281
- You are also up for full partnership.
- As are you.

13:13.382 --> 13:17.652
- I'm willing to take the risk.
- Why are we wasting our time? There's a child missing.

13:24.224 --> 13:26.819
Garrett, I need you.

13:27.859 --> 13:30.854
- To do research.
- Okay.

13:30.963 --> 13:33.957
If person breaks the law or takes the law
into his or her hands...

13:34.065 --> 13:36.763
in order to save someone,
say a kidnapped child...

13:36.866 --> 13:39.803
what is the exposure,
either civil or criminal?

13:39.902 --> 13:43.671
- I need the answer 1 O minutes ago.
- Got it.

13:43.771 --> 13:45.501
Go.

13:49.775 --> 13:52.872
- My lawyer dropped me.
- Bugger.

13:52.979 --> 13:54.641
- If you think you won-
- I do.

13:54.746 --> 13:57.148
- I'll find another one.
- No, you won't.

13:57.248 --> 14:00.048
Nobody's going to make any money
suing Denny Crane...

14:00.150 --> 14:02.950
with a client who initiated
the conflict by throwing a rock.

14:03.052 --> 14:06.650
If you can find another shark like the last one,
you know where to find me.

14:06.755 --> 14:06.755
Only, don't come in personally, okay, sport?
I'll file a complaint for stalking.

14:09.625 --> 14:11.720
Only, don't come in personally, okay, sport?
I'll file a complaint for stalking.

14:17.196 --> 14:20.897
Mr. Kirk,
I'll represent you.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.196
- This awoke?
- Of course it is.

14:23.301 --> 14:26.467
No, it isn't.
I'll be your lawyer.

14:26.571 --> 14:28.972
I'm confused.

14:29.071 --> 14:31.906
You're right, Denny.
No other lawyer will take his case.

14:32.007 --> 14:34.034
So it's going to be me.

14:40.914 --> 14:43.281
Shock and awe, boys.
Shock and awe.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.284
Are we confident
he's going to be here?

14:45.384 --> 14:47.354
Works nights. He's home.

14:53.056 --> 14:55.526
F. B. I., ma'am.
We're looking for Dominic Martini.

15:00.995 --> 15:05.902
You're under arrest for aiding and abetting
a felony, conspiracy to commit kidnapping.

15:08.300 --> 15:10.600
Tell us where your brother is!

15:10.702 --> 15:13.036
Shut up!

15:13.138 --> 15:16.167
- Anybody here speak Spanish?
- I think it's Russian.

15:16.274 --> 15:20.076
It's Italian.

15:34.320 --> 15:36.551
- Let's take him!
- No!

15:46.496 --> 15:50.264
Have you both lost your minds?

15:50.365 --> 15:53.895
impersonating
f. B. I. mockers?

15:54.001 --> 15:55.867
- With the Bureau's consent.
- Officially?

15:55.968 --> 15:58.598
- No, but-
- You've got to be kidding.

15:58.705 --> 16:01.302
- We're not going to do anything crazy.
- You already have.

16:01.407 --> 16:04.810
- Shirley-
- We are lawyers. We sue people.

16:04.909 --> 16:07.972
Occasionally we get aggressive
and garnish wages.

16:08.079 --> 16:10.139
We do not abduct.

16:10.246 --> 16:13.878
Denny shoots people.

16:13.982 --> 16:17.545
I would never have expected this.
Not even from Alan Shore.

16:17.652 --> 16:20.088
Shirley,
I know this little boy.

16:20.187 --> 16:23.591
Hews taken
partly on my watch.

16:23.690 --> 16:27.458
I have to do
whatever I can do.

16:27.560 --> 16:29.894
I don't care about the risk.

16:33.230 --> 16:36.669
The firm will have nothing
to do with this whatsoever.

16:36.766 --> 16:40.101
- Understood.
- From now on, I don't even want to know about it.

16:40.202 --> 16:42.536
You two are coming up
for partner.

16:42.637 --> 16:45.608
There are two things that you
should constantly be aware of.

16:45.706 --> 16:49.042
Your actions reflect
on Crane, Poole & Schmidt.

16:49.142 --> 16:52.136
- What's the other thing?
- You're Schmidt.

16:56.515 --> 16:59.110
Let me do the talking,
all obit.

16:59.216 --> 17:01.277
Why?
Because you're Man nix?

17:01.384 --> 17:03.285
Denise.

17:03.386 --> 17:06.323
Garrett, what's the answer
to my question? The short one.

17:06.422 --> 17:08.391
Oh. Basically, if compliance
with the law...

17:08.490 --> 17:10.824
will result in a greater
harm than breaking the law...

17:10.924 --> 17:13.588
the defense of necessity
justifies breaking the law.

17:13.694 --> 17:16.255
I could kiss you,
but I won't.

17:16.362 --> 17:18.332
Let's go.

17:31.139 --> 17:33.042
It's not only about
being against you.

17:33.142 --> 17:35.839
- I'm doing this to help him.
- First offal, you're a lawyer here.

17:35.942 --> 17:38.208
- If he waives the conflict-
- And secondly, you're a witness.

17:38.311 --> 17:40.247
- Denny, look, I'm not-
- We're friends.

17:40.347 --> 17:42.976
- Yes, we are.
- And we're sleeping together!

17:48.986 --> 17:51.456
I'm guarding you against night terrors.
This is the payback I get?

17:51.555 --> 17:54.549
- Look-
- No. I'm not going to look.

18:02.630 --> 18:05.066
- Denny.
- Get out.

18:05.165 --> 18:09.833
Why are you being such a bully?
Your insurance company will undoubtedly pay.

18:09.935 --> 18:12.962
- That's not the point.
- You shot the man with a gun between the eyes.

18:13.069 --> 18:15.563
You could've blinded him.
You perhaps could've killed him.

18:15.673 --> 18:18.303
- He deserves to be compensated!
- Well, he's not going to be.

18:18.408 --> 18:21.503
- You want to take me to court?
- I certainly don't wanna go to court.

18:24.145 --> 18:26.410
Denny, I looked at that man-

18:26.513 --> 18:31.785
an indigent sitting across
from a room full of us-

18:31.884 --> 18:37.326
Shirley, Paul, you, me- the rich.

18:37.422 --> 18:41.759
You know we've got 37 million people in
this county living below the poverty line?

18:41.858 --> 18:44.385
Thirteen percent of
the American population.

18:44.494 --> 18:46.862
They don't get education.
They don't get health insurance.

18:46.962 --> 18:49.932
For God's sake, they don't even
get rescued when they're dying.

18:50.031 --> 18:53.002
t just-
I feel compelled to help him.

18:53.099 --> 18:55.069
You must understand that.

18:56.268 --> 18:59.263
Helping the poor?
Yes.

18:59.371 --> 19:01.671
Helping him get me?
No.

19:18.885 --> 19:21.355
You're in a lot of trouble,
my friend.

19:21.454 --> 19:26.292
- Spoke to your employer.
He informed me you speak English.

19:26.390 --> 19:29.624
So I'll regard these protests
in a foreign language...

19:29.727 --> 19:32.892
as your first attempt to deceive
the federal government.

19:32.995 --> 19:34.897
I have rights.

19:34.997 --> 19:38.561
- Sixth amendment, counsel. - A four-year-old
child is missing. Your brother has him.

19:38.667 --> 19:41.797
I'd say that adds up to a bad day
for your constitutional rights.

19:41.903 --> 19:44.270
- I don't know anything about-
- Bad answer!

19:44.371 --> 19:47.433
You are going to help me get this child back,
or arms are going to get broken...

19:47.540 --> 19:50.706
ligaments severed, electrical devices
might even get attached to testicles.

19:50.810 --> 19:53.542
And I don't mean mine!
Know why I'm going to get away with all this?

19:53.645 --> 19:56.411
- A four-year-old is missing!
- I don't know where my brother is.

19:56.513 --> 19:58.710
- Think harder!
- I swear I don't know where he is!

19:58.816 --> 20:01.251
- Who does?
- I don't know!

20:01.350 --> 20:04.379
Now that response didn't seem
vey considered, Dominic.

20:06.087 --> 20:09.149
That's disappointing.

20:09.256 --> 20:11.624
- Get out, Denise.
- Brad, I-

20:11.725 --> 20:14.252
Get out, please.
Now.

20:26.002 --> 20:28.403
Your time's up,
Mr. Martini.

20:29.738 --> 20:31.765
- He sees a priest.
- Excuse me?

20:31.873 --> 20:35.835
I know he goes to this priest.
Maybe he knows something.

20:36.942 --> 20:39.470
What's the name
of this priest?

20:40.580 --> 20:43.482
Father Michael Ryan.

20:43.581 --> 20:45.814
St. Joseph, North End.

20:48.853 --> 20:51.880
He can't break the confessional seal.
He's a priest.

20:51.986 --> 20:55.186
What about searching his office?
Sometimes they keep records of confessions.

20:55.290 --> 20:57.760
No judge anther will
give us that warrant.

21:02.296 --> 21:05.289
What? What are you tying
to not say now?

21:05.397 --> 21:08.369
Well, if you guys
are willing to keep going...

21:08.466 --> 21:13.202
back in our more aggressive days, we were
known to use a phony warrant now and then.

21:13.303 --> 21:15.797
We, of course, don't now.

21:15.906 --> 21:19.105
How the two of you
managed to get one...

21:19.207 --> 21:21.643
I'll never know.

21:23.778 --> 21:26.374
I don't know.

21:26.479 --> 21:29.713
- We've gone this far.
- Really?

21:30.884 --> 21:32.944
Really?

21:37.922 --> 21:39.891
Let's go.

21:50.230 --> 21:52.894
- Whatever.
- I tm’s made the news.

21:52.999 --> 21:56.562
It's out there that a senior partner
of Crane, Poole & Schmidt...

21:56.668 --> 21:59.037
assaulted a homeless man.

22:00.906 --> 22:04.002
- You have nothing to say?
- You heard what I said-whatever.

22:04.107 --> 22:08.877
That's it?
That's your response?

22:08.979 --> 22:11.346
You want a response?
Watch it like everybody else.

22:12.681 --> 22:14.809
What do you mean,
"Watch it like everyone else?"

22:14.916 --> 22:18.479
- I'm going back on Larry in tonight.
- What?

22:18.584 --> 22:20.919
Well, you saw me the last time.
I popped.

22:22.588 --> 22:25.387
First offal, the last time...

22:25.489 --> 22:28.188
you at least victimized
a despicable person.

22:28.292 --> 22:30.318
- This time-
- Paul, the people wanna hear from me.

22:30.426 --> 22:33.421
Denny, this could be a disa-

22:34.931 --> 22:37.196
TiVo me.

22:45.037 --> 22:47.838
- We bark, Brad. No biting.
- Got it.

22:47.941 --> 22:51.709
Let's keep this
under control.

22:51.809 --> 22:54.211
- May I help you?
- Good morning, Sister.

22:54.311 --> 22:58.512
I'm Special Agent Rob of the F. B. I.
This is Special Agent Beadle.

22:58.614 --> 23:01.517
- How are you today?
- The F. B. I. has already been here.

23:01.616 --> 23:04.213
Well, we're back.
Where's Father Ryan?

23:04.319 --> 23:08.918
I'm Father Ryan, and I've said about all
I'm going to say on this matter.

23:09.023 --> 23:11.755
Please, Father.
A little boy's life is at stake.

23:11.858 --> 23:15.796
As I explained to your other agents,
if had communications...

23:15.894 --> 23:18.023
they would’ve occurred
inside the confessional.

23:18.129 --> 23:22.592
And I would unfortunately
be prohibited by canon law...

23:22.699 --> 23:25.431
from revealing the content
of such communications.

23:25.534 --> 23:28.266
Without revealing any specific
exchanges, Father...

23:28.369 --> 23:31.466
could you tell us if you’ve been in receipt
of any information...

23:31.572 --> 23:34.372
pertaining to this abduction?

23:34.474 --> 23:36.375
I'm afraid I cannot.

23:36.475 --> 23:40.812
We have a warrant, Father, authorizing us
to search your office premises.

23:40.912 --> 23:43.576
- Is this your office?
- You can't be serious.

23:43.680 --> 23:47.950
- Is this your office, Father?
- Any records would also be sealed subject to canon law.

23:48.052 --> 23:50.453
That you’d have to argue
before a district court judge.

23:50.552 --> 23:52.921
I can tell you that we are
not subject to canon law.

23:53.022 --> 23:56.653
- And we are authorized to conduct a search.
- You will make no such search.

23:56.757 --> 23:58.623
- We have a warrant.
- I don't care!

23:58.725 --> 24:03.189
I have documents pertaining to privileged
relationships with parishioners.

24:03.295 --> 24:05.491
- You're not going in there.
- Please step aside, Father.

24:05.596 --> 24:07.623
We have a warrant
authorizing us to search.

24:07.733 --> 24:10.897
And please do not make us
arrest you for obstruction of justice.

24:12.769 --> 24:14.671
We need to search
your office, Father...

24:14.771 --> 24:16.672
and we need
to do it now, please!

24:33.751 --> 24:35.687
One second.

24:42.892 --> 24:45.020
What are you doing?

24:46.928 --> 24:49.957
That door is worth a fortune.
It was imported from Italy.

24:50.064 --> 24:52.590
Threaten to break it down.

24:55.800 --> 24:58.033
Please step aside, Father.

24:58.136 --> 25:00.037
Are you out of your minds?

25:00.137 --> 25:02.606
I will give you
to the count of three.

25:02.705 --> 25:04.938
- If you do not unlock it-
- I'm calling the police!

25:05.042 --> 25:06.806
- One-
- You can't come crashing in here!

25:06.909 --> 25:08.878
- Two-
- You wouldn't dare.

25:08.977 --> 25:11.140
- Three!
- Okay!

25:39.934 --> 25:44.032
The ax was already in motion.
The priest just stuck his hand in there.

25:44.137 --> 25:47.632
- How many fingers?
- Three.

25:47.739 --> 25:50.505
We recovered two.
The cat ran off with the third.

25:51.976 --> 25:53.878
It was an accident.

25:53.978 --> 25:56.505
I just wanted to make him think
that I was about to destroy the door.

25:56.613 --> 26:00.415
- It was my idea.
- He just stuck his hand out.

26:00.515 --> 26:02.849
We're not being arrested,
if that’s what your concern is.

26:02.950 --> 26:06.183
Well, that's one of my concerns.
That priest is going to be suing...

26:06.285 --> 26:09.451
you and the firm fore number
with a lot of zeros in it.

26:09.555 --> 26:13.153
- Surely that's occurred to you.
- We might've caught a break there.

26:13.258 --> 26:15.990
- From the priest's office.
- What's this?

26:16.094 --> 26:19.361
- Papal blessings.
- Excuse me?

26:19.462 --> 26:21.591
The diocese sells
papal blessings...

26:21.697 --> 26:24.190
complete with the pope's signature,
to the tune of30 bucks a pop.

26:24.299 --> 26:26.234
These are counterfeit.

26:26.333 --> 26:29.270
The priest's got a printing press
and a stack of these back there.

26:29.369 --> 26:33.605
He's bootlegging papal blessings
to the tune of about six figures a year.

26:33.706 --> 26:35.607
We've got a rogue priest here.

26:36.943 --> 26:40.244
Denise, Brad, a second?

26:44.148 --> 26:46.846
We found the third finger.
I've got it here on ice.

26:46.950 --> 26:50.046
Evidently, if we get it over to the hospital,
they can still reattach it.

26:51.854 --> 26:55.053
I know it's a big favor to ask,
but, uh, would you deliver it?

26:55.156 --> 26:59.528
- Excuse me?
- We've been kind of busy.

26:59.625 --> 27:01.560
Byte way, uh...

27:01.661 --> 27:05.464
it would be wrong for you
to stop by the priest's hospital room...

27:05.564 --> 27:08.261
and use the finger to tee to extort
information out of him.

27:08.365 --> 27:12.269
The F. B. I. could never do that,
and I would never ask the two of you to do it.

27:12.367 --> 27:16.933
Even though, uh, the priest
likely knows something that could help us.

27:17.039 --> 27:19.065
I can't look at it.

27:22.275 --> 27:25.041
Okay, it was just a thought
that I never shared.

27:25.145 --> 27:27.115
Give me the finger!

27:28.514 --> 27:30.949
It stays viable on ice
for 18 hours max.

27:31.049 --> 27:33.815
Again, I wouldn't want you to do
anything inappropriate.

27:33.917 --> 27:36.718
Give me the finger.

27:43.758 --> 27:46.421
This is the general release.

27:46.526 --> 27:50.159
You'll need to sign there
and initial there.

27:50.263 --> 27:52.232
Okay.

27:53.364 --> 27:57.668
And initial here...

27:57.768 --> 27:59.828
next to
the confidentiality clause.

27:59.936 --> 28:01.632
Okay.

28:03.106 --> 28:06.635
And that should do it.
Here's the best part-your check.

28:06.741 --> 28:11.273
Oh, my God!
$75, too.

28:11.378 --> 28:13.905
Man, I isn’t never seen
this much money at once.

28:14.014 --> 28:17.248
Mr. Kirk, I won't be
so arrogant as to give you a life lecture.

28:17.350 --> 28:20.753
But however you came into your dire straits,
I hope you use this money productively t_

28:20.852 --> 28:24.621
Don’t you worry. Don’t you worry about that.
Don’t you worry.

28:24.722 --> 28:27.158
Whoa, whoa.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

28:27.258 --> 28:30.457
- This check came from you.
- It's an accounting thing.

28:30.559 --> 28:32.995
But it's a personal check
from you. Why?

28:34.795 --> 28:38.198
- It's really of no concern.
- I want to know why.

28:40.900 --> 28:42.801
You deserve that settlement.

28:42.901 --> 28:45.599
I'm fortunate enough
to be able to part with it.

28:45.704 --> 28:50.440
The truth is I can afford to value
other things more than money.

28:50.540 --> 28:53.944
One such item being my
friendship with Denny Crane.

28:55.878 --> 28:58.473
But why'd you represent me
if you knew-

28:58.579 --> 29:01.779
I suppose I thought I could prioritize
principle over that friendship.

29:01.882 --> 29:04.944
But the reality is I can't.
Which means you either...

29:05.051 --> 29:08.786
accept this check from me,
or you get yourself another lawyer.

29:21.530 --> 29:24.660
- Well?
- Well, what?

29:24.766 --> 29:27.498
You were trying to settle
Denny's case. Well?

29:27.601 --> 29:30.767
- I tm’s under control.
- And Denny, how do we get him under control?

29:30.871 --> 29:33.500
- Yours?
- I'll settle for anybody's.

29:33.605 --> 29:37.136
Alan, the wagons
are beginning to circle.

29:37.243 --> 29:39.712
He shoots a client
in the knee.

29:39.810 --> 29:43.408
He celebrates it on the Larry in show
before a live audience.

29:43.513 --> 29:46.348
He then shoots a homeless man
with a paintball gun...

29:46.448 --> 29:49.817
and plans to reprise his role
On Larry King.

29:49.917 --> 29:52.012
- What?
- Yes. He's been invited back.

29:52.119 --> 29:54.646
And why wouldn’t he be?
He got a seven share.

29:54.754 --> 29:58.523
But the point is this firm
isn’t just Shirley and me.

29:58.624 --> 30:01.652
The other partners
are getting fed up.

30:01.759 --> 30:05.459
One more embarrassment,
God knows what he'll say next.

30:10.398 --> 30:13.929
I'll take it.

30:16.937 --> 30:19.033
Why are you shooting Jane Fonda?

30:19.140 --> 30:21.302
Because I can't shoot you.
You're my friend.

30:21.407 --> 30:24.242
And friends
don't hurt each other.

30:24.344 --> 30:25.903
Denny-

30:26.012 --> 30:30.075
Jane and I used to,
you know.

30:30.181 --> 30:33.711
- You and Jane Fonda?
- Mom. Lest we forget Berber_/d.

30:33.817 --> 30:35.753
Then she turned on me,
went red.

30:35.852 --> 30:38.014
They caught her in one of those
Communist bitch hunts.

30:38.120 --> 30:40.454
- I think you mean "witch hunts. "
- No.

30:40.555 --> 30:43.583
I'm right on this one.

30:43.690 --> 30:48.290
- Take that, Hanoi Jane!
- Why are you going on Larry in

30:48.394 --> 30:51.229
- Because the American public wants to hear from me.
- No.

30:51.330 --> 30:53.356
They want to be entertained
by shock and drivel.

30:53.464 --> 30:55.799
That's why that show
is so happy to exploit you.

30:55.900 --> 30:59.633
There's only so much embarrassment
the partners at this firm will stand for, Denny.

30:59.736 --> 31:01.933
What are they going to do?
Get rid of me? I'm the star of the show.

31:02.038 --> 31:03.904
Even so,
don't go on that program.

31:04.005 --> 31:06.703
Since when do you care whether
this firm is embarrassed or not?

31:06.807 --> 31:08.799
I don't.
I care about you.

31:08.908 --> 31:12.871
You've been a gigantic ass
about all this.

31:12.979 --> 31:15.210
And if you’re determined
to be absurd...

31:15.314 --> 31:19.048
at least have the common sense,
if not the decency, to keep it to yourself.

31:19.151 --> 31:23.214
Contrary to what you and the rest of the world
think, I know exactly what I'm doing.

31:26.589 --> 31:28.558
Indeed.

31:40.900 --> 31:43.734
- I'm sorry. No visitors. Just-
- F. B. I.

31:45.170 --> 31:47.663
Out.

31:52.342 --> 31:54.471
Uh, nest offal
I'd like to say that; uh...

31:54.576 --> 31:56.477
I'm glad to see
you're doing okay.

31:56.577 --> 31:59.811
And secondly,
I deeply apologize-

31:59.914 --> 32:02.817
Why don’t you save your
apologies for the trial?

32:04.717 --> 32:08.884
Father Ryan,
we've discovered...

32:08.987 --> 32:12.254
the counterfeit papal blessings
and the printing press in your office.

32:12.356 --> 32:16.456
Your days as a priest are over
should this become public.

32:18.527 --> 32:23.594
1oe Martini previously kidnapped and killed
a five-year-old child.

32:23.697 --> 32:27.430
We know that this man regularly
comes to you to seek absolution.

32:27.533 --> 32:30.869
He probably confessed
his prior crime to you.

32:31.937 --> 32:34.965
Now he's taken another child.

32:35.073 --> 32:37.634
Maybe you know, maybe you don't.

32:37.742 --> 32:42.113
But this kid-
this kid could still be alive.

32:42.212 --> 32:46.584
I don't care about the confessional seal
or canon law.

32:49.016 --> 32:50.986
I want this boy.

32:52.453 --> 32:55.049
And if you care at all
about this child...

32:55.154 --> 32:58.456
or your future as a priest,
you will help us.

33:01.992 --> 33:04.155
Screw you.

33:06.163 --> 33:09.657
I know the clergy likes
to speak hypothetically.

33:09.765 --> 33:15.207
So, if there was a child out
there in a kidnapper's hands...

33:15.303 --> 33:17.568
and something were to
come into your possession...

33:17.670 --> 33:20.141
that didn't rightly
belong to you...

33:20.240 --> 33:24.646
but you could use it
to help save the child-

33:28.612 --> 33:30.911
Would you use it?

33:36.985 --> 33:41.254
There's a three-room house
in Revere Beach, tiny.

33:41.356 --> 33:44.725
He keeps it under an alias,
Miguel Rivera.

33:44.824 --> 33:48.490
That's all I know, I swear.
Now give me back my finger.

33:58.701 --> 34:02.037
3729. Yeah, got it.
Jump squad's on its way.

34:02.137 --> 34:04.606
- Ask them if can suit up.
- You cannot suit up.

34:04.706 --> 34:06.732
- I have paramilitary training.
- Are you kidding?

34:06.840 --> 34:09.710
The liability alone-
You've done enough as Man nix.

34:09.810 --> 34:11.779
Yeah, I'm still here.
Okay.

34:13.478 --> 34:16.382
- We better get there before them.
- They told us to wait.

34:21.518 --> 34:23.545
Don't even think about it.

34:47.737 --> 34:49.797
- Gracie Jane.
- Denny Crane.

34:49.906 --> 34:52.433
- Gracie Jane.
- You making fun of me?

34:52.542 --> 34:55.138
No, sugar. I'm guest hosting
the show tonight.

34:55.243 --> 34:58.111
- Oh. Where's Larry?
- He's out sick.

34:58.212 --> 35:03.210
- I came to talk to Larry.
- Don't worry. I'll be gentle.

35:05.884 --> 35:07.785
Find me a glass.

35:07.885 --> 35:10.253
So you’re a hijacker?

35:10.354 --> 35:12.688
No, I shot the man in the forehead
with a paintball gun.

35:12.789 --> 35:15.157
And the week before that,
an indigent in the knee!

35:15.258 --> 35:19.458
- A child rapist scum.
- Is that your excuse, hijacker?

35:19.561 --> 35:21.930
- Stop calling me that. Where's Larry?
- I'm calling you that...

35:22.030 --> 35:24.727
because it is high-priced
attorneys like you...

35:24.830 --> 35:27.028
who are hijacking
our legal system.

35:27.134 --> 35:29.729
You can read it in my book,
High jacked.

35:29.834 --> 35:32.828
- Can we talk about the issues?
- Sure, hijacker.

35:32.937 --> 35:35.340
It's people like you
who are ruining our county.

35:35.440 --> 35:37.966
I'm not ruining the county.
Poor people are ruining the county.

35:38.074 --> 35:43.106
You sit there in your $2, OOO
suit blaming poor people?

35:43.211 --> 35:45.681
- Our Father who art in heaven-
- Answer the question.

35:45.780 --> 35:49.184
The poor people have plunged
this county into debt.

35:49.283 --> 35:51.913
So much so that there are
liberals in Washington...

35:52.018 --> 35:54.351
who want to take away
my tax cuts, your tax cuts.

35:54.453 --> 35:56.981
We worked hard
for those tax cuts.

35:57.089 --> 36:00.083
And we're supposed to give 'em up for what?
for Medicaid?

36:00.191 --> 36:02.923
Education? Teach 'em how to read?
Hell, if they could read, they wouldn’t be poor.

36:03.026 --> 36:05.519
If Larry were here, he'd get this.
But you take Katrina.

36:05.628 --> 36:08.291
The poor people have cost this county
billions and billions!

36:08.396 --> 36:10.299
- In what way?
- Well, the rich got out.

36:10.399 --> 36:13.564
The damn poor just hung around!

36:13.667 --> 36:16.102
For what? To watch.
Now we have to pay for it.

36:16.202 --> 36:18.138
Maybe they couldn't get out.

36:18.237 --> 36:22.870
Maybe they thought that the federal
government might rescue them.

36:22.974 --> 36:26.208
- Or failing that, give a damn.
- How stupid is that?

36:26.310 --> 36:30.545
Now, what I committed here was
an act of civil disobedience.

36:30.646 --> 36:33.618
I shot the guy in the head
as a wake-up call.

36:33.716 --> 36:38.987
We have got to motivate
the lazy slobs in this county...

36:39.087 --> 36:41.784
to get off their fat,
lazy asses and go to work!

36:42.888 --> 36:44.880
Let's get America back on track.

37:19.116 --> 37:21.347
Tito, are you here?

37:21.450 --> 37:23.647
All clear up here.

37:38.330 --> 37:41.392
Oh!

38:23.163 --> 38:26.533
- Who's Gracie Jane?
- I don't want to talk about it.

38:26.633 --> 38:28.795
Everybody thought I
was being facetious.

38:28.901 --> 38:33.272
They thought it was inspired satire.
Just can't win.

38:36.239 --> 38:39.301
- They got the child back.
- So I heard.

38:39.408 --> 38:41.469
Good day.

38:41.577 --> 38:45.778
Yes. As for our case,
I made it go away.

38:47.347 --> 38:50.045
You're completely off the hook.

38:52.518 --> 38:54.419
That was your plan
the whole time.

38:54.519 --> 38:56.955
Get in good with him,
talk him out obit.

38:57.054 --> 38:59.752
The old Trojan horse.

38:59.856 --> 39:01.791
- What did you tell him?
- None of your business.

39:01.890 --> 39:05.830
I wish you'd let me in on the game.
I can act, you know? I won an Emmy.

39:08.730 --> 39:10.632
Just the same.

39:16.769 --> 39:20.263
- What's this?
- A check for $75, OOO.

39:20.371 --> 39:25.438
It's for you, not for him.
I pay my own way.

39:25.542 --> 39:29.276
- How did you know?
- Here's a little secret.

39:30.345 --> 39:33.579
I know things.
Don't tell.

39:33.682 --> 39:36.812
That secret seems
unbelievably safe.

39:47.693 --> 39:51.597
Denny, when we were coming out
of the subway station the other day...

39:51.695 --> 39:55.065
and Randall asked us for change,
did you hear him?

39:55.164 --> 39:59.502
Or even notice he was there before
he hit you in the head with the rock?

40:01.636 --> 40:04.766
- Did you?
- No.

40:04.871 --> 40:07.364
You like poor people, don’t you?

40:08.407 --> 40:10.876
That comment you made about-

40:12.910 --> 40:15.380
"We don't even save them
when they're dying. "

40:15.479 --> 40:20.317
You don't think we let people die in
New Orleans because they were poor, do you?

40:22.417 --> 40:26.186
- Don't be silly.
- You do think that.

40:26.287 --> 40:28.621
He threw a rock, Denny.

40:28.723 --> 40:31.888
He'd had enough of being
ignored, neglected.

40:31.991 --> 40:35.225
He rose up and threw a rock
at some rich guy.

40:35.327 --> 40:38.821
Thirty-seven million, Denny.

40:40.464 --> 40:43.163
You ever wonder what would happen
if they all decided to rise up?

40:43.267 --> 40:45.702
Are we still talking
about hurricanes?

40:45.802 --> 40:50.106
That hurricane was as much
a social disaster as a natural one.

40:50.205 --> 40:54.736
And the next hurricane to hit could
very well be in the form of anarchy.

40:57.844 --> 40:59.745
One week it's clowns.

40:59.845 --> 41:01.746
The next week it's anarchy.

41:01.846 --> 41:04.579
- What do you do for fun?
- This.

41:04.683 --> 41:08.052
- Sleep at my place tonight?
- I haven't decided.

41:08.151 --> 41:11.419
Let's see
how the night goes.

01:23:38.761 --> 01:23:40.320
You stinker!
