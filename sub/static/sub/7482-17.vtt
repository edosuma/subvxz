00:01.116 --> 00:03.483
Previously on NCIS: Los Angeles:

00:03.651 --> 00:06.643
- Who's the target?
- The locals call him Spin Pairay,

00:06.821 --> 00:08.118
the White Ghost.

00:08.289 --> 00:09.450
You're gonna kill him.

00:09.624 --> 00:11.615
- You see him?
- Yeah, I see him.

00:11.793 --> 00:14.262
Take the shot, Agent Blye.

00:16.564 --> 00:17.895
Agent Blye, take the shot.

00:22.237 --> 00:23.329
Oh, my God.

00:24.839 --> 00:26.830
- What happened?
- Not even sure it was him.

00:27.008 --> 00:29.602
I want a detailed report in my hands
within the hour.

00:30.311 --> 00:31.472
Fine.

01:05.013 --> 01:07.448
Please. Let me make this right.

01:09.250 --> 01:10.718
Say it.

01:10.885 --> 01:12.876
Into the camera.

01:15.857 --> 01:18.224
I'm ATF Agent Kevin Clark.

01:18.760 --> 01:24.199
And like a cowardly snake
hiding in the brush,

01:24.365 --> 01:28.859
I've been conducting
an undercover operation.

01:29.404 --> 01:34.365
I am what is wrong
in this world of hypocrisy.

01:35.143 --> 01:38.636
Our federal ranks
have been infiltrated,

01:38.813 --> 01:43.307
and my kind will be eliminated.

01:43.985 --> 01:46.215
I will not be the last.

01:49.424 --> 01:53.292
I... am a rat.

01:54.062 --> 01:56.360
And like all rats,

01:56.731 --> 01:59.996
- I will be promptly exterminated.
- Do it.

02:01.369 --> 02:03.098
Wait. Wait, wait. No!

02:28.196 --> 02:30.688
Boom! In and out before 9:15 a.m.

02:30.865 --> 02:33.027
That is how you close a case.

02:33.201 --> 02:35.602
And I understand that saving the day
is just part of my job,

02:35.770 --> 02:39.001
but you can thank me later
with bottomless pitchers at O'Malley's.

02:41.009 --> 02:42.340
What was that?

02:42.577 --> 02:44.739
- What was... What was what?
- Out there.

02:44.912 --> 02:47.006
- Why'd you go?
- Why did I go?

02:47.181 --> 02:48.876
Two reasons:
One, there was an F-150

02:49.050 --> 02:51.041
filled with explosives
barreling down at us.

02:51.219 --> 02:54.450
- And two, you said, "Go, go, go."
- He didn't mean go.

02:54.622 --> 02:57.489
I said go
so that they'd show their hand.

02:57.659 --> 02:59.889
- That's not what you said.
- It's what he didn't say.

03:00.061 --> 03:01.781
Why didn't you just say,
"I need more time"?

03:01.929 --> 03:03.556
Because the bad guys
would know the plan.

03:03.731 --> 03:05.961
- But shouldn't I know the plan?
- You should.

03:06.134 --> 03:08.728
And you should know that sometimes
the plan changes.

03:08.903 --> 03:11.065
Okay. Here's the deal.
We won, okay?

03:11.239 --> 03:13.708
We should be feasting on the enemy's
finest meats and cheeses.

03:13.875 --> 03:14.899
What is the problem here?

03:15.076 --> 03:16.636
We need to know
you're on the same page.

03:16.778 --> 03:18.678
We need to know
you can read our intent.

03:19.714 --> 03:20.943
You mean your minds?

03:21.549 --> 03:23.677
I do recognize
that you guys have developed

03:23.851 --> 03:26.684
some sort of mutant
telepathic connection here, but I...

03:26.854 --> 03:28.015
Did you hear that, Sam?

03:28.189 --> 03:30.749
Oh, yeah. That was cute.

03:30.925 --> 03:33.360
- What was cute?
- He misses her.

03:33.528 --> 03:36.589
Oh, my God. Right, you're gathering
that from what I just said?

03:36.764 --> 03:39.665
- Yeah.
- Your intent was pretty clear to me.

03:39.834 --> 03:42.667
- It's not what you're saying, it's...
- It's what you're not saying.

03:42.837 --> 03:44.100
- Exactly.
- You know what?

03:44.272 --> 03:48.175
I've always wondered what it'd be like
to have two older brothers that I hated.

03:48.343 --> 03:49.367
Now I know.

03:49.544 --> 03:51.842
That sounds like a cry for help
from a lonely childhood.

03:52.013 --> 03:53.481
You wanna play this game too,
Beale?

03:53.648 --> 03:57.209
If it's about the case on deck
in ops, yes.

03:57.385 --> 04:00.116
Your childhood's gonna have to wait.
Tsk, chop-chop.

04:00.288 --> 04:02.279
Isn't there some sort of agent
union mandate

04:02.457 --> 04:05.392
that prohibits multiple cases
without a massage in between?

04:05.560 --> 04:07.654
Yeah, but it doesn't matter.
You're not an agent.

04:07.829 --> 04:09.888
I keep opening doors,
you keep walking through them.

04:10.064 --> 04:12.294
It sounds like
someone doesn't like his job.

04:12.467 --> 04:13.992
I think Hetty should be informed.

04:14.168 --> 04:15.966
No, no.
No informing Hetty of anything.

04:16.137 --> 04:18.469
No, no.
That's not what my intent said.

04:18.639 --> 04:19.663
What I meant was...

04:19.841 --> 04:22.003
If you're not cut out for the job,
I understand.

04:22.176 --> 04:23.507
Son of a...

04:31.519 --> 04:34.716
This went viral two hours
after it was posted this morning.

04:35.056 --> 04:38.856
They pulled it,
but not before it got 12,000 hits.

04:39.026 --> 04:41.893
Warning: It's pretty graphic.

04:44.532 --> 04:46.261
I'ma rat.

04:47.068 --> 04:49.298
And like all rats,

04:49.737 --> 04:52.468
I will be promptly exterminated.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.938
- Do it.
- Wait. Wait, wait. No! No!

04:58.646 --> 05:03.345
ATF has confirmed the identity
of the victim as Agent Kevin Clark.

05:03.518 --> 05:06.715
- But why us? Why not ATF?
- Hetty asked the same question.

05:08.289 --> 05:11.657
Agent Clark
was part of a joint task force

05:11.826 --> 05:13.988
investigating the Navy's concern

05:14.162 --> 05:18.861
about sailors on shore leave
engaging in criminal activity.

05:19.033 --> 05:22.628
Ships come into port,
guys wanna see L.A. for a little R & R.

05:22.804 --> 05:25.705
Next thing you know, a sailor's
in over his head with gambling debt.

05:25.873 --> 05:27.898
When he can't pay,
his family's threatened,

05:28.075 --> 05:29.941
forcing him to smuggle guns

05:30.111 --> 05:32.876
or fork over launch codes
for the latest nuclear subs.

05:33.047 --> 05:36.039
Easy target
for anyone willing to take advantage.

05:37.718 --> 05:39.482
Keep me abreast of your findings.

05:39.654 --> 05:40.678
Will do, Hetty.

05:41.355 --> 05:43.619
So who kills a fed
and puts it on YouTube?

05:43.791 --> 05:45.725
Someone who wants
to send a message.

05:45.893 --> 05:47.987
Back off or else.

05:48.162 --> 05:51.223
You gotta have some serious muscle
to send a message like that.

05:52.300 --> 05:55.292
Somebody who thinks
they have the power to take us on.

05:55.470 --> 05:58.462
- Any idea where this happened?
- No, some sort of garage.

05:58.639 --> 06:00.971
And no report of a body yet.

06:01.142 --> 06:04.544
The support beams in this garage
are from the 1920s.

06:04.712 --> 06:07.113
They're not retrofitted
for seismic activity.

06:07.281 --> 06:10.808
We were able to identify the buildings
of that area yet to be retrofitted.

06:10.985 --> 06:14.615
They're all in a three-block radius
of downtown's Little Tokyo.

06:16.624 --> 06:18.149
Who was Agent Clark investigating?

06:18.326 --> 06:20.090
Still waiting to hear from the ATF.

06:20.261 --> 06:22.093
Little Tokyo's run
by the Black Dragons,

06:22.263 --> 06:23.992
Gaki Boyz and Yakuza.

06:24.165 --> 06:25.826
Check out ATF,
see what you can find.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.764
Talk to anybody
who knows Agent Clark.

06:27.935 --> 06:28.993
On it.

06:29.670 --> 06:31.263
We need those addresses, Eric.

06:31.439 --> 06:33.032
Got it.

06:39.080 --> 06:42.448
Agent Stone is finishing a call.
He'll be right with you, detective.

06:42.617 --> 06:44.381
Thank you so much.

06:45.152 --> 06:47.678
Really taking advantage
of that Casual Tuesday, huh?

06:47.855 --> 06:48.879
I'm working a biker gang

06:49.056 --> 06:51.115
- moving a ton of meth out in Palmdale.
- Hmm.

06:51.292 --> 06:53.283
Unfortunately,
most of them will get away.

06:53.461 --> 06:54.656
Why is that?

06:54.829 --> 06:57.855
Not enough budget for the manpower.
We can only go after the top guys.

06:58.366 --> 07:00.733
They do make it difficult, don't they?

07:02.236 --> 07:03.897
Only if you ask permission.

07:04.071 --> 07:06.039
Yeah, better to beg for forgiveness,
right?

07:07.408 --> 07:08.534
Are you here about Clark?

07:09.877 --> 07:10.901
Lam.

07:11.078 --> 07:13.911
You have any idea
what he was working on?

07:14.081 --> 07:15.742
Clark didn't like to share.

07:15.917 --> 07:17.749
Hated to divvy up the glory.

07:19.020 --> 07:20.920
Hopefully,
that's not what got him killed.

07:21.088 --> 07:22.112
Not that it matters.

07:22.290 --> 07:25.282
Either way, he's dead.
No one deserves to go out like that.

07:25.459 --> 07:26.939
Sorry to keep you waiting, detective.

07:27.094 --> 07:29.188
Not a problem.
Agent Bower was just filling me in.

07:29.363 --> 07:31.161
You're taking over Clark's caseload.

07:31.332 --> 07:34.495
Because I don't already
have enough of a backlog.

07:36.671 --> 07:38.662
Interesting creature.

07:38.839 --> 07:41.001
So you got a little tension
in the ranks, huh?

07:41.175 --> 07:44.873
Some short fuses from too much work
and not enough bodies, that's all.

07:45.046 --> 07:48.243
Right. Agent Clark have any leads
in his investigation?

07:48.883 --> 07:51.215
We busted some sailors
moving guns over the border.

07:51.385 --> 07:53.444
Clark said the joint task force
had a lead,

07:53.621 --> 07:55.783
said he'd brief me when they could.

07:55.957 --> 07:57.118
Never happened.

07:57.825 --> 08:00.260
- Who else knew that?
- Only me.

08:01.128 --> 08:02.425
Is that pretty standard?

08:02.797 --> 08:04.788
I'm covering 50 operations.

08:04.966 --> 08:06.434
Twelve in L.A.

08:06.601 --> 08:08.501
Sometimes they intersect.

08:08.669 --> 08:12.435
In an emergency,
it gives our guys plausible deniability.

08:13.274 --> 08:15.936
Right. So they can't, uh,
tell what they don't know.

08:18.946 --> 08:21.313
I get to go do damage control.

08:21.482 --> 08:23.917
I'll be happy to answer
any of your questions later.

08:24.085 --> 08:27.487
Call me if you think of anything.
Thank you so much for your time.

08:27.989 --> 08:29.388
- Oh, detective.
- Yeah?

08:30.191 --> 08:31.784
Here's something.

08:32.827 --> 08:35.421
Clark was working without a partner
when he should've been.

08:36.097 --> 08:37.292
Budget cuts.

08:38.765 --> 08:41.360
Report that to the suits upstairs.

08:43.004 --> 08:45.439
I will. Thank you, sir.

08:51.912 --> 08:54.279
- Any sign of that convoy?
- No, sir.

08:54.448 --> 08:55.472
Got a drone in the air?

08:55.650 --> 08:58.711
We're flying a search radius from
the disabled vehicle they abandoned.

08:58.886 --> 09:00.183
Still nothing.

09:00.354 --> 09:02.686
- Where's Blye?
- Haven't seen her yet.

09:07.495 --> 09:08.963
Hey, Blye, we need to talk.

09:11.265 --> 09:12.858
Blye?

09:24.145 --> 09:25.772
All right, she's not here.

09:25.946 --> 09:28.711
- You didn't see her go out?
- No, sir.

09:31.218 --> 09:34.085
- Anybody seen Blye this morning?
- No.

09:34.255 --> 09:36.883
- Mm-mm. No.
- Mm-mm.

09:42.463 --> 09:44.397
Find out if any vehicles
have been checked out

09:44.565 --> 09:47.330
or if anybody saw her
leave the base.

10:00.079 --> 10:01.774
Number five.

10:01.947 --> 10:05.247
I'm starting to think whoever killed
Agent Clark took the body with them.

10:05.418 --> 10:06.749
I'm getting way more familiar

10:06.919 --> 10:09.479
with the underbelly
of Little Tokyo than I'd like to.

10:09.655 --> 10:11.123
Yeah.

10:11.290 --> 10:13.850
Upside is, we're near
some of the best udon in L.A.

10:14.026 --> 10:16.927
You know where the best udon
in L.A. is, don't you?

10:17.129 --> 10:18.790
I know
where you think the best udon is.

10:18.964 --> 10:21.331
Thirty miles
from the nearest FDA office,

10:21.500 --> 10:23.867
in an industrial park
next to a strip club.

10:24.036 --> 10:26.869
- It does have character.
- Yeah, it probably has botulism too.

10:27.673 --> 10:29.971
Sam Hanna doesn't support
the little guy.

10:30.142 --> 10:31.507
I support the little guy.

10:31.677 --> 10:33.237
I'm just not gonna pay him
to poison me.

10:38.918 --> 10:40.317
Hey.

10:40.486 --> 10:42.511
Fifth time's a charm?

10:43.622 --> 10:45.556
If you're looking for bullet hits.

10:50.596 --> 10:52.860
It's definitely blood.

10:53.766 --> 10:55.700
Where's the body?

11:00.873 --> 11:01.965
Got drag marks.

11:11.584 --> 11:12.949
G.

11:26.265 --> 11:27.755
His tongue was cut out.

11:28.134 --> 11:30.432
What do you think blew his cover?

11:32.104 --> 11:33.731
Could have slipped up.

11:34.106 --> 11:36.575
Yeah, or he was served up.

11:42.581 --> 11:44.743
What do you got? Possible lead?

11:44.917 --> 11:47.011
Blank on the other side.

11:47.186 --> 11:50.053
Except for the matrix barcode.

11:55.995 --> 11:58.487
It's asking for a password.

11:59.131 --> 12:01.395
Sounds like a job for Eric and Nell.

12:08.774 --> 12:11.141
Stop! Federal agents!

12:11.644 --> 12:13.305
Split up.

12:44.210 --> 12:47.236
Like I said, federal agents.

12:51.951 --> 12:54.181
Jason Anakawa.

12:54.353 --> 12:57.846
Vandalism, petty theft.

12:58.023 --> 13:00.856
Public indecency? Really?

13:01.727 --> 13:03.286
What were you doing
down at the garage?

13:03.462 --> 13:05.123
Practicing my parkour?

13:05.931 --> 13:09.162
Yeah? You need to start
practicing your lying too.

13:09.335 --> 13:11.497
I guess we can add murder
to the list, huh?

13:11.670 --> 13:13.764
I didn't murder Agent Clark.

13:16.108 --> 13:17.371
Who's Agent Clark?

13:19.445 --> 13:21.277
I didn't mention Agent Clark.
Did you?

13:21.447 --> 13:24.007
I didn't say a word
about an Agent Clark.

13:24.183 --> 13:26.208
I gotta admit,

13:26.385 --> 13:27.648
now I'm curious.

13:28.521 --> 13:32.014
I'm a member
of the 3rd Street Gaki Boyz.

13:32.191 --> 13:34.353
I was Agent Clark's in.

13:34.527 --> 13:36.689
- You're a snitch?
- Informant.

13:36.862 --> 13:38.387
Excuse me. Informant.

13:38.564 --> 13:40.555
Couldn't say anything at the garage.

13:40.733 --> 13:42.064
They have eyes everywhere.

13:42.234 --> 13:43.668
So, what are you doing down there?

13:43.836 --> 13:46.328
Heard what happened.
I was looking for him.

13:46.505 --> 13:48.166
How'd you know where to find him?

13:48.507 --> 13:49.906
A suspected gang informant

13:50.075 --> 13:52.840
got merc'd two weeks ago
at that same spot.

13:53.012 --> 13:54.411
Who killed Agent Clark?

13:54.580 --> 13:57.641
I don't know for sure,
but that's the Gaki Boyz style.

13:58.050 --> 14:01.020
Why would the Gaki Boyz
want Agent Clark dead?

14:01.186 --> 14:02.415
They don't.

14:02.588 --> 14:05.319
If it was us,
we were just carrying out orders.

14:05.491 --> 14:07.084
Carrying out orders from who?

14:07.259 --> 14:09.193
The Yakuza.

14:09.361 --> 14:13.025
They run everything
from 3rd Street to Broadway.

14:14.066 --> 14:16.194
You seem to know the area
pretty well.

14:16.368 --> 14:18.530
Grew up there.

14:18.704 --> 14:21.639
My dad owned a bar
and worked his ass off for 30 years

14:21.807 --> 14:23.536
but barely saw a profit.

14:24.043 --> 14:28.310
Paying protection
to gangs like the Yakuza.

14:28.948 --> 14:31.110
It literally killed him.

14:31.283 --> 14:33.183
So how did you end up
with the Gaki Boyz?

14:35.020 --> 14:37.216
After my father died,

14:37.389 --> 14:39.881
I lost it for a while.

14:40.426 --> 14:42.895
Got in with the wrong crowd.

14:43.829 --> 14:45.797
Made mistakes.

14:46.565 --> 14:47.691
You know?

14:48.334 --> 14:50.769
So why the sudden change of heart?

14:50.936 --> 14:52.995
Some of the Boyz
were shaking down a store owner,

14:53.172 --> 14:55.266
and it all came rushing back.

14:55.774 --> 14:58.573
What those guys did to my father...

14:59.778 --> 15:03.772
At that moment, I promised myself
I'd do something about it.

15:04.216 --> 15:05.911
How'd you meet Agent Clark?

15:07.419 --> 15:10.548
He had a chance to bust me
and let me go.

15:10.723 --> 15:13.215
Said he saw something in me.

15:14.393 --> 15:17.419
Reached out one day
and asked me to work for him.

15:18.063 --> 15:20.088
Said I could redeem myself.

15:21.166 --> 15:23.897
You have any idea
how his cover got blown?

15:27.773 --> 15:29.002
I'll tell you what I know,

15:29.174 --> 15:31.768
but you gotta get me back
to the streets, ASAP.

15:31.944 --> 15:35.107
The longer I'm in here,
the worse it's gonna be.

15:37.616 --> 15:40.984
If somebody saw you, then you're
probably safer in here with us.

15:41.153 --> 15:43.952
No, I'd rather take my chances
out there.

15:47.626 --> 15:49.754
Clark was good to me.

15:50.496 --> 15:53.625
If I can help you take down
who did this,

15:53.966 --> 15:55.297
I will.

16:02.274 --> 16:04.140
Hey, any news?

16:04.309 --> 16:05.333
Yeah, I checked it out.

16:05.511 --> 16:07.673
Seems Agent Clark and Agent Bower
had a beef.

16:07.846 --> 16:10.941
Clark notified the media of a bust,
which tipped off the bad guys.

16:11.116 --> 16:12.140
No arrests were made.

16:12.317 --> 16:14.786
So maybe Bower had an ax to grind.

16:14.953 --> 16:16.011
Anything else?

16:16.188 --> 16:17.519
Nothing yet.

16:18.190 --> 16:20.284
But, look, whoever killed Agent Clark

16:20.459 --> 16:23.019
knew that building
was a security-camera blind spot.

16:23.195 --> 16:24.526
Anything from ATF?

16:24.697 --> 16:26.617
I think Clark
may have fallen through the cracks.

16:26.765 --> 16:29.291
They have a lot going on over there.

16:29.468 --> 16:31.994
Actually, Stone mentioned
Clark was working without a partner.

16:32.171 --> 16:35.004
Maybe he tried to alert somebody
when things started to go bad.

16:35.174 --> 16:40.340
Hmm. Well, if ATF is backlogged,
then, yeah, they could have missed it.

16:40.746 --> 16:43.306
All right, so I'll search
for any transmissions

16:43.482 --> 16:46.577
or phone messages that were sent
by Clark before he was killed.

16:46.752 --> 16:48.015
- Great.
- Okay.

16:56.595 --> 16:59.121
Is there anything else?

17:01.734 --> 17:04.294
Yeah. Did...? Sorry. Um...

17:04.470 --> 17:05.493
Have you...?

17:06.605 --> 17:09.040
Have you had any contact
with Kensi?

17:09.708 --> 17:12.040
Uh... No, actually.

17:12.211 --> 17:14.839
I haven't heard from her
for a day or two.

17:15.012 --> 17:17.948
- Why? What's up?
- Nothing. I just... I can't reach her.

17:18.117 --> 17:19.743
Well...

17:19.917 --> 17:21.977
- I imagine she's safe.
- Hmm.

17:22.154 --> 17:24.213
I mean, she's a big girl.

18:09.934 --> 18:10.958
Anything?

18:11.135 --> 18:13.135
Yeah, we thought the ATF
may have missed something.

18:13.304 --> 18:14.499
And they did.

18:14.672 --> 18:16.572
Agent Clark had to know
the meeting place,

18:16.740 --> 18:18.674
because he set up
a surveillance camera

18:18.842 --> 18:21.903
that automatically uploaded
the photos to a drop box.

18:22.079 --> 18:23.239
The photos were never opened.

18:23.380 --> 18:26.247
- Who's the guy talking to Agent Clark?
- I'm pulling it up now.

18:27.985 --> 18:29.316
I got a facial match.

18:29.486 --> 18:31.011
Meet Tommy Walker.

18:31.355 --> 18:32.555
Career criminal in the making.

18:32.723 --> 18:33.849
Can you find him?

18:34.225 --> 18:36.023
- I can try.
- How'd you guys make out?

18:36.193 --> 18:37.753
Agent Clark was looking
into the Yakuza.

18:37.895 --> 18:39.863
They own the building
where we found his body.

18:40.030 --> 18:42.362
He also had an informant embedded
with the Gaki Boyz.

18:42.533 --> 18:45.503
Gaki Boyz. That's hardcore.

18:45.669 --> 18:50.573
Okay, Walker just used his debit card
at a bar in West Hills 26 minutes ago.

18:50.741 --> 18:53.039
Well, let's hope he drinks slow.
I'm on it.

18:53.210 --> 18:55.804
Wait. You guys have to see this.

18:58.949 --> 19:01.441
This happened 30 minutes ago.

19:01.619 --> 19:03.339
The guy in the black shirt
running the show,

19:03.487 --> 19:06.923
that's Takashi Shiro, fastest rise
to boss within the Yakuza family.

19:07.091 --> 19:09.958
- Who's this guy they grabbed?
- Agent Stone.

19:10.127 --> 19:11.788
ATF.

19:42.660 --> 19:45.891
- What do we know about Shiro?
- Bad Guy Hall of Fame candidate.

19:46.063 --> 19:49.897
Wanted globally for racketeering,
arms smuggling and murder.

19:50.067 --> 19:51.262
The big guy next to him,

19:51.435 --> 19:54.166
that's his bloodthirsty bodyguard,
Cho Yamamoto.

19:54.338 --> 19:56.204
And no ID on the third guy.

19:56.373 --> 19:57.636
Okay. Thanks.

19:57.808 --> 20:00.334
L.A.P.D.'s on the scene.
They'll call us if they find anything.

20:00.511 --> 20:03.173
I want access to every
available camera in the area.

20:03.347 --> 20:06.180
Think. Why Stone? Why now?

20:06.350 --> 20:10.480
Stone told Deeks he was the only one
privy to Agent Clark's investigation.

20:10.654 --> 20:14.090
They could have forced Agent Clark
to give up Stone before they killed him.

20:14.258 --> 20:17.091
Stone was working on dozens
of different undercover ops.

20:18.195 --> 20:20.635
And if they torture Stone to give up
those other operatives...

20:20.798 --> 20:23.927
We could be looking at gangland
executions of dozens of agents.

20:24.335 --> 20:27.498
We're gonna have to shut down every
operation we're running with the ATF.

20:27.671 --> 20:30.436
Years of undercover work wasted.

20:31.141 --> 20:33.132
I'm open to suggestions.

20:36.113 --> 20:38.514
Very well. We have no choice.

20:38.682 --> 20:41.208
We can't risk the chance
that they've been made.

20:41.385 --> 20:43.183
Hetty, give us a little more time.

20:43.354 --> 20:45.948
Time is the one thing
we don't have very much of.

20:46.123 --> 20:48.683
At least give us till end of day
before you pull the trigger.

20:49.960 --> 20:53.225
All right, but if any other operation
is compromised...

20:53.397 --> 20:55.195
I know. You'll pull them out.

20:57.368 --> 21:00.827
If it's not already too late.

21:04.942 --> 21:07.206
Don't waste our time,
we won't waste yours.

21:07.378 --> 21:09.278
We know you set up Agent Clark.

21:09.446 --> 21:12.643
Heh. Whatevs, man. I have no clue
what you're talking about.

21:18.355 --> 21:20.187
You know him.

21:21.992 --> 21:24.086
You got a federal agent murdered.

21:24.428 --> 21:26.226
I'm talking no parole.

21:28.132 --> 21:29.361
Once he's locked up,

21:29.533 --> 21:31.228
maybe he can start
his own reality show.

21:32.202 --> 21:33.897
Real Housewives of Cell Block 2.

21:34.071 --> 21:35.835
Hey, hey, hey.

21:36.006 --> 21:37.735
I didn't know dude was a fed.

21:37.908 --> 21:39.342
Straight up, you know?

21:39.510 --> 21:41.103
- No.
- You're dumber than you look.

21:41.278 --> 21:42.712
What do you do for the Yakuza?

21:45.215 --> 21:46.740
Look... Look, man.

21:46.917 --> 21:49.215
I'm just a street-level
independent contractor, all right?

21:49.386 --> 21:53.789
The company provides a service
that targets sailors looking for thrills.

21:53.957 --> 21:56.927
When they hit the shores
looking for a good time, boom!

21:57.094 --> 22:00.291
The company gives it to them.

22:00.464 --> 22:04.230
Big-time. Anything you can think of.
Gambling, girls...

22:04.401 --> 22:05.960
Drugs?

22:06.170 --> 22:09.538
What are you into anyway, big man?
Hmm? Goth Lolitas?

22:09.706 --> 22:11.105
We got them too.

22:12.109 --> 22:13.372
What is this?

22:13.544 --> 22:16.206
Heh. Just the key
to the best time of your life.

22:17.281 --> 22:19.001
Cards get passed out
when the ships come in.

22:19.149 --> 22:22.141
If they're interested, they zap that
with their phone, and it's on.

22:22.319 --> 22:24.048
Where do we get the password?

22:24.221 --> 22:25.586
Yours truly.

22:25.756 --> 22:26.780
You enter the password,

22:26.957 --> 22:29.449
choose from a dropdown list,
and, blam, you get hooked up.

22:29.626 --> 22:32.652
Easy peasy,
20th-century technology, baby.

22:32.830 --> 22:34.764
This is the 21st century, baby.

22:36.033 --> 22:38.900
Whatever, man.
Look, all I know is that it works.

22:39.470 --> 22:40.995
We got a pickup service
and everything.

22:41.171 --> 22:42.371
Guys can't navigate Obamacare,

22:42.539 --> 22:45.065
but they can get a hooker
in two minutes. Know what I'm saying?

22:45.242 --> 22:46.903
- Put your hands down.
- Okay.

22:47.077 --> 22:49.157
I'm starting to see
why they take guys to the garage.

22:49.313 --> 22:50.747
How'd they make Agent Clark?

22:52.382 --> 22:54.142
I don't know,
but this time it was different.

22:54.284 --> 22:55.308
How so?

22:55.486 --> 22:57.318
Usually, the guys hit me up
for the password,

22:57.488 --> 22:59.354
and I send them on their way.

23:01.024 --> 23:03.083
I was told
to pick up that dude personally.

23:03.627 --> 23:04.822
By who?

23:05.295 --> 23:06.956
Seriously?

23:07.130 --> 23:09.792
This is the Yakuza.

23:09.967 --> 23:13.267
Cool suits, missing fingers,
appetite for murder?

23:13.437 --> 23:15.303
Pfft. You don't ask guys
like that questions.

23:15.472 --> 23:16.496
I just answer the phone,

23:16.673 --> 23:18.698
do whatever the dude
on the other end tells me to.

23:19.710 --> 23:21.235
Excuse me, G.

23:27.251 --> 23:28.275
Password.

23:29.152 --> 23:30.642
Now.

23:35.158 --> 23:36.478
Check out them Goth Lolitas, bro.

23:36.627 --> 23:38.220
Shut up and write the password down.

23:38.395 --> 23:39.692
Hey, man, dang, come on.

23:39.863 --> 23:44.528
Look, just know that if you go
into one of their buildings, you're in.

23:44.701 --> 23:46.226
I'm talking lockdown.

23:50.140 --> 23:51.164
This better work.

23:51.341 --> 23:52.900
It will.

23:56.413 --> 23:58.677
- You believe him?
- It's the best lead we got.

23:58.849 --> 24:01.409
Besides,
he's not smart enough to lie.

24:05.255 --> 24:06.586
Sam, what are you thinking?

24:06.757 --> 24:10.057
Underage girls, overpriced drugs
or crooked dice?

24:10.227 --> 24:12.218
Let's roll the dice.

24:16.567 --> 24:18.695
Damn, he wasn't kidding.
This is high-tech.

24:18.869 --> 24:21.099
We're set for a pickup in Hollywood
in one hour.

24:25.609 --> 24:26.906
How we looking, fellas?

24:27.077 --> 24:30.138
Well, it's quiet on this end.

24:30.314 --> 24:32.442
I still think I make a better sailor
than you.

24:33.684 --> 24:34.708
I am a sailor.

24:34.885 --> 24:36.614
Exactly, too close to it.

24:36.787 --> 24:38.755
Nobody's buying you as Navy.

24:38.922 --> 24:40.515
Unless it's Old Navy.

24:42.292 --> 24:44.212
If you guys are done talking
about your feelings,

24:44.361 --> 24:47.797
you should probably pay attention
to the car approaching from the west.

24:48.632 --> 24:50.726
Why don't you get yourself
in character, huh?

24:50.901 --> 24:51.925
It's not a character.

25:03.113 --> 25:04.444
Thank you.

25:04.615 --> 25:07.482
Whoo. Feeling lucky today,
you know?

25:12.956 --> 25:14.981
Get us everything you can
on that building.

25:15.158 --> 25:17.388
We're pulling
into a garage across the street.

25:17.561 --> 25:20.587
Activating Geospatial Information
Fusion Technology.

25:21.365 --> 25:24.733
Uh, wouldn't it be easier
to just say GIFT?

25:24.901 --> 25:27.427
Yeah, but it's not nearly
as Star Trek - îsh.

25:27.604 --> 25:29.572
You're right. Heh.

25:30.207 --> 25:33.199
Okay, so the building
has seven floors.

25:33.377 --> 25:35.846
Most all access points
were sealed years ago

25:36.013 --> 25:38.414
except, of course, for the side entrance
where they took Sam.

25:38.582 --> 25:41.051
And it looks like the Monroe Group
owns that building

25:41.218 --> 25:43.915
and all the surrounding buildings
as well.

25:44.087 --> 25:45.714
Okay, guys, just so you know,

25:45.889 --> 25:49.416
it looks like there's been nearly
a dozen investigations

25:49.593 --> 25:53.086
trying to implicate the Monroe Group
as a front for a Yakuza crime family.

25:53.263 --> 25:54.731
Thanks, Nell.

25:57.768 --> 25:59.288
Okay, I'm going crazy sitting in here.

25:59.436 --> 26:02.133
I think I'm gonna do a lap,
see what I can see.

26:02.606 --> 26:04.597
Don't talk to strangers.

26:04.775 --> 26:06.368
Thanks, Dad.

26:33.236 --> 26:34.965
Damn it. I got company.

26:41.078 --> 26:43.672
Clear in the back.
Heading to the front.

27:02.866 --> 27:05.096
No, no, no.

27:05.602 --> 27:09.664
Um, guys, we got a little bit
of a situation here.

27:13.877 --> 27:16.744
Yeah, Clark's informant, Anakawa?

27:16.913 --> 27:18.381
They killed him.

27:34.997 --> 27:36.624
So much for redemption.

27:36.798 --> 27:38.266
How do you think they got onto him?

27:39.234 --> 27:40.963
Maybe Stone's talking.

27:41.136 --> 27:42.968
Yeah, but Stone hadn't heard
from Agent Clark,

27:43.138 --> 27:44.538
so there's no way he could've known

27:44.673 --> 27:46.801
that Clark was using Jason
as an informant.

27:47.776 --> 27:51.212
Then either Clark gave up Jason
before he was killed

27:52.080 --> 27:54.208
or the Yakuza saw Jason
talking to us at the garage.

27:54.816 --> 27:57.945
- Which could mean...?
- Sam could be walking into a trap.

28:10.732 --> 28:12.632
Seven out.

28:12.801 --> 28:14.394
All right.

28:15.103 --> 28:16.127
Here.

28:16.305 --> 28:18.706
- Take care of me, baby. Hook me up.
- My pleasure.

28:18.874 --> 28:20.364
- Heh, heh.
- Or yours.

28:22.377 --> 28:25.278
Handsome new shooter coming out.

28:26.782 --> 28:29.581
Hmm. Let me see,
let me see, let me see.

28:29.751 --> 28:31.241
Yeah, like that. Let me see.

28:31.420 --> 28:33.684
- Thank you, Betty.
- Whoo!

28:33.855 --> 28:35.414
Gonna make some money?

28:35.591 --> 28:38.219
- You look like you need some money.
- Ha, ha.

28:39.761 --> 28:40.785
Winner.

28:43.932 --> 28:45.400
I'm just getting started.

28:45.567 --> 28:48.366
Sam, we just found Jason Anakawa's
body behind the building.

28:48.537 --> 28:50.904
We may have been made
at the garage. Let's get you out.

28:51.740 --> 28:54.835
Okay. Give it to me.

28:55.010 --> 28:56.034
Winner!

28:59.047 --> 29:00.981
Sam, do you copy?

29:02.718 --> 29:04.447
Nobody's home.

29:05.387 --> 29:07.014
Eric, I need eyes and ears.

29:07.189 --> 29:08.213
I'm working on it.

29:08.390 --> 29:10.552
Looks like the building
is using a scrambler.

29:10.726 --> 29:14.094
I'm trying to boost the signal,
but this is gonna take time.

29:14.263 --> 29:16.493
- We can't just leave him in there.
- Coms go down.

29:16.665 --> 29:19.760
No matter what, you get three cycles to
check in before we go in guns blazing.

29:19.935 --> 29:20.959
To hell with cycles.

29:21.136 --> 29:22.797
These guys have no problem
killing people.

29:22.971 --> 29:24.735
We have to give Sam a chance
to do his job.

29:25.340 --> 29:27.001
Okay, okay.

29:27.175 --> 29:30.236
We also need to find a way
to get in there if he needs us.

29:32.514 --> 29:35.108
- Keep an eye on the front.
- Got it.

29:35.651 --> 29:38.416
Eric, I need roof access
at my location.

29:47.262 --> 29:48.923
All kind of action in here.

29:49.097 --> 29:50.428
You have no idea.

29:50.599 --> 29:51.691
Really?

29:53.769 --> 29:54.793
Ready?

29:54.970 --> 29:56.460
You ready?

29:56.638 --> 29:58.106
Yeah?

29:59.675 --> 30:02.576
- Lucky seven.
- Oh!

30:02.744 --> 30:04.144
See? That's what I'm talking about.

30:04.313 --> 30:05.439
I do this all day.

30:05.614 --> 30:07.981
I do this all day long.

30:08.150 --> 30:09.276
A man with staying power.

30:10.218 --> 30:13.153
You have no idea, all right?

30:14.089 --> 30:16.023
You know what? For the table.

30:16.191 --> 30:18.250
- Here, all right. That's for you.
- Aw.

30:18.427 --> 30:19.690
Uh, bathroom?

30:21.463 --> 30:23.363
All right, pass my roll.
I'll be back, okay?

30:23.532 --> 30:26.524
Don't be long.
We don't want the dice to cool off.

30:26.702 --> 30:28.466
That's impossible. I'm on fire, baby.

30:28.637 --> 30:31.766
Don't you agree? Heh, heh. Yeah.

30:35.344 --> 30:36.869
Gentlemen.

30:38.613 --> 30:41.639
Callen, the door
on your right, it leads to the roof.

30:45.921 --> 30:47.286
Deeks, back to me.

30:47.456 --> 30:50.016
All right, copy that, right behind you.

30:58.700 --> 31:00.668
Yo, how much to get back here?

31:00.836 --> 31:02.463
- VIPs only.
- Come on, man.

31:02.637 --> 31:04.997
You got the Goth Lolitas back there?
How much? Come on, man.

31:22.891 --> 31:23.915
Federal agents.

31:24.092 --> 31:26.754
Put your hands where I can see them
and you turn around slowly.

31:27.529 --> 31:28.792
I'm ATF.

31:28.964 --> 31:30.762
And get down so they don't see you.

31:30.932 --> 31:32.525
Bower, what the hell
are you doing here?

31:32.701 --> 31:35.966
After Stone got grabbed,
I took a look through Clark's files.

31:36.138 --> 31:38.607
His notes led me to this building.

31:39.441 --> 31:40.521
Clark may have been an ass,

31:40.675 --> 31:43.440
but I'm not gonna stand by
while it's open season on our agents.

31:43.612 --> 31:45.171
We still got a man inside.

31:45.347 --> 31:47.782
I hope you can get him out.
Something's got them buzzing.

31:51.820 --> 31:53.515
Right there.

31:53.688 --> 31:56.055
Third guy just bolted back inside.

31:57.592 --> 32:01.051
Two guards left out front.
This might be our best chance.

32:11.039 --> 32:14.100
Hey. Hey, hey.

32:15.477 --> 32:17.275
Hey, hey.

32:17.779 --> 32:20.043
Please tell me that you're a cop.

32:25.187 --> 32:26.484
Is that what I think it is?

32:36.097 --> 32:37.565
Yeah.

32:39.434 --> 32:41.960
It's an execution station.

32:54.515 --> 32:56.347
I can't reestablish communication.

32:56.517 --> 33:00.454
Sam's missed his third check-in cycle.
I'll notify Hetty.

33:00.621 --> 33:02.783
Consider me notified.

33:02.956 --> 33:04.617
Call the ATF task force.

33:04.792 --> 33:06.954
Inform them
they've been compromised.

33:07.127 --> 33:10.791
I want every undercover agent
extracted immediately.

33:10.964 --> 33:12.625
- Which operation?
- All of them.

33:12.800 --> 33:14.359
Okay.

33:18.338 --> 33:19.703
Time's up. No word from Sam.

33:19.873 --> 33:22.774
There's gotta be another way
into this place.

33:24.511 --> 33:27.208
And I think I just found it.

33:29.717 --> 33:31.242
I'm gonna need a diversion.

33:31.418 --> 33:32.715
That's what I'm talking about.

33:32.886 --> 33:34.752
Is there a plan, or are we free-styling?

33:34.922 --> 33:36.583
Oh, there's always a plan.

33:40.527 --> 33:41.858
My name is John Stone.

33:42.029 --> 33:43.428
I'm an ATF agent.

33:43.597 --> 33:46.032
Please tell me
that someone knows you're here.

33:46.200 --> 33:49.067
I'm just a Navy guy
with a dice addiction.

33:49.236 --> 33:51.762
Then why'd they throw you in here?

33:53.006 --> 33:54.940
I was up pretty big.

33:55.109 --> 33:57.407
Maybe they thought I was cheating.

33:58.378 --> 34:01.211
I don't know how much longer
I can hold out.

34:01.381 --> 34:04.578
I already...
I already gave up two names.

34:04.752 --> 34:06.015
They killed them both.

34:06.520 --> 34:09.512
They cut one of my guy's
tongues out.

34:12.426 --> 34:15.521
Look, I understand the importance
of maintaining an undercover,

34:15.696 --> 34:18.529
but if you are a LEO,
we have got to get out of here.

34:18.699 --> 34:20.224
We've got to get out of here.

34:21.268 --> 34:23.464
You're right about one thing.

34:23.637 --> 34:27.801
It's time to get out of here. Get up.

34:40.853 --> 34:42.947
Uh, Callen, if...

34:43.123 --> 34:45.319
If you're thinking
what I think you're thinking,

34:45.492 --> 34:47.051
I highly advise against it.

34:47.226 --> 34:50.458
That is a live power line
that hasn't been serviced in years.

34:50.630 --> 34:53.225
Besides, the line is not designed
to hold your body weight.

34:53.400 --> 34:56.391
Not to mention, if you touch
an exposed section, you're toast.

34:56.570 --> 34:57.901
Can you shut it down?

34:58.071 --> 35:00.870
I mean, not without shutting
down the power in the whole building.

35:01.041 --> 35:02.440
It'll alert them all inside.

35:02.609 --> 35:04.441
Keep working
on trying to contact Sam.

35:04.611 --> 35:06.978
Deeks, now would be a good time.

35:28.435 --> 35:31.166
- You gotta call an ambulance.
- You have to get out of here now.

35:31.338 --> 35:32.931
I think I have some internal bleeding.

35:33.106 --> 35:34.301
Not my problem. Now, move.

35:34.474 --> 35:36.834
I know, I'm, like, bleeding out.
I think I punctured a lung.

35:36.977 --> 35:38.138
Get out of here right now.

35:38.312 --> 35:40.838
I can't. Everything's going black.

35:41.014 --> 35:43.108
I think I'll pass out.

35:44.551 --> 35:45.848
Let's move him to the alley.

35:54.228 --> 35:55.525
Get up.

35:57.297 --> 35:58.787
We gotta move that car too.

36:21.054 --> 36:23.284
Got three agents inside.
We can't wait for backup.

36:23.457 --> 36:25.721
- Let's doit.
- On me.

36:49.283 --> 36:50.614
No way out.

36:50.784 --> 36:53.719
Here.
You're hurt pretty bad. You take it.

36:57.157 --> 36:59.091
Help me get this tape off.

37:00.861 --> 37:04.229
- What are you doing?
- Only a cop moves like that.

37:04.398 --> 37:06.230
Or an agent.

37:06.934 --> 37:08.595
How much do they know?

37:09.469 --> 37:11.164
Nice plan.

37:12.205 --> 37:16.733
You bust yourself up, play victim.
Then if I'm a cop, I save you.

37:35.095 --> 37:36.585
Sounds like the cavalry.

37:41.101 --> 37:42.830
Turn around.

37:52.646 --> 37:54.740
- There's Shiro.
- I see him.

37:58.485 --> 37:59.509
Federal agents.

38:00.587 --> 38:03.079
Don't even think about it.
On your knees, right now.

38:03.256 --> 38:04.917
Put your hands up.

38:08.829 --> 38:10.160
Hands.

38:13.867 --> 38:15.631
Drop it, Stone.

38:15.802 --> 38:17.770
If you want him to live,
I suggest you drop it.

38:20.807 --> 38:23.606
Last chance. Gun down now.

38:24.177 --> 38:25.440
Don't.

38:26.179 --> 38:27.647
He can't shoot a federal agent.

38:28.215 --> 38:30.377
I can. And will.

38:33.320 --> 38:34.344
Okay.

38:43.563 --> 38:44.792
Hands up.

38:44.965 --> 38:47.457
Walk to me. Walk to me.

38:47.634 --> 38:49.159
In the room.

38:51.038 --> 38:52.199
Go.

38:52.372 --> 38:55.672
Go, go, go.

38:55.842 --> 38:57.367
Move.

39:02.416 --> 39:05.784
- Why?
- I'm tired of fighting the fight.

39:05.952 --> 39:07.716
Never enough money,
never enough men...

39:07.888 --> 39:09.754
It's never enough.

39:10.657 --> 39:12.887
Do you have any idea
how much money they're paying me?

39:13.560 --> 39:16.154
A lifetime's salary
for a little bit of information.

39:16.329 --> 39:18.195
What about your brothers
in the field, huh?

39:18.698 --> 39:21.099
We knew what
we signed up for, right?

39:22.469 --> 39:24.028
I think we got enough.

39:24.504 --> 39:26.336
Yeah, it was pretty cut and dry.

39:30.477 --> 39:32.104
Bullets help.

39:38.952 --> 39:40.681
That's pretty slick.

39:41.888 --> 39:43.014
When did you know?

39:43.190 --> 39:45.750
Stone was the only possible link
between Clark and his informant.

39:47.094 --> 39:49.495
- You?
- I had my suspicions.

39:49.663 --> 39:51.563
Agent Clark's tongue.

39:51.731 --> 39:54.393
No way he could've known about that
without being there.

39:57.971 --> 39:59.871
- Who else did you give up?
- Agh.

40:00.040 --> 40:02.065
Nobody. Unh.

40:02.242 --> 40:03.710
I don't believe him, Sam.

40:04.211 --> 40:05.691
How many other agents
did you give up?

40:05.846 --> 40:07.837
Just the two. It was just the two.

40:08.014 --> 40:09.614
The Yakuza were supposed
to send payment,

40:09.783 --> 40:12.445
and I promised them
other names after the payment. Agh.

40:13.320 --> 40:18.417
If another agent turns up dead,
we're gonna make a video of our own.

40:37.511 --> 40:38.672
Do you speak English?

40:40.280 --> 40:41.975
My name is Kensi Blye.

40:53.059 --> 40:54.925
Wait a minute. Wait.

40:55.095 --> 40:57.996
I need to speak to the one
they call the White Ghost.

41:12.946 --> 41:15.643
Oh, man, I would have paid anything
to see the look on Stone's face

41:15.815 --> 41:17.806
- when you dropped those bullets.
- Classic.

41:17.984 --> 41:21.978
Bravo, gentlemen.
Our undercover operations are secure,

41:22.155 --> 41:24.715
thanks to you all.

41:24.891 --> 41:27.155
Just doing what we do.

41:27.327 --> 41:30.160
If Eric shows up with another case,
just do me a favor and shoot him.

41:30.330 --> 41:32.128
Yeah? Because I'm exhausted.

41:32.299 --> 41:36.133
I did more work today than
the Beverly Hills P.D. do in a week.

41:36.303 --> 41:37.429
I'm sorry, Mr. Deeks,

41:37.604 --> 41:41.199
I didn't realize
that you were feeling overloaded.

41:42.175 --> 41:43.973
No, no, I didn't mean...

41:44.144 --> 41:48.479
It would appear that you don't
appreciate your employment status.

41:48.648 --> 41:52.243
Uh, no, no. That's not what I meant.
I just meant that little...

41:52.419 --> 41:53.818
Can I have some help here, guys?

41:53.987 --> 41:56.513
Hetty, I just wanted to say
we love our jobs.

41:56.690 --> 41:58.530
Headed home
to finish some paperwork right now.

41:58.692 --> 41:59.887
We got...?

42:00.060 --> 42:01.323
You guys got my six, right?

42:01.494 --> 42:03.292
Hey, what happened
to brothers in arms?

42:03.463 --> 42:05.192
Guys?

42:05.966 --> 42:08.458
You do realize my six
is behind my back

42:08.635 --> 42:10.694
and not down the tunnel, right?

42:11.171 --> 42:12.696
You were saying?

42:15.342 --> 42:17.242
I was... Yeah, no, I was just saying

42:17.410 --> 42:22.348
how much I care
and appreciate my employment status.

42:24.251 --> 42:26.185
That's what I thought.

42:26.353 --> 42:29.812
Now, get your damn feet
off the desk.
