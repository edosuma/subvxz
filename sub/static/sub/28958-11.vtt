<i>My name is Talon.</i>

00:03.267 --> 00:05.812
<i>I'm the last Blackblood,
or so I've been told.</i>

00:05.947 --> 00:08.445
<i>I escaped when Everit Dred 
killed all my people.</i>

00:08.533 --> 00:11.069
<i>I cut off the points of my ears 
to hide in plain sight.</i>

00:11.515 --> 00:13.563
<i>A tiny creature lives
inside me,</i>

00:13.696 --> 00:15.478
<i>passed to me
by my dying mother.</i>

00:15.722 --> 00:18.367
<i>It gives me the power 
to open portals to another world</i>

00:18.455 --> 00:20.750
<i>and summon powerful demons 
called Lu-Qiri.</i>

00:20.992 --> 00:22.296
<i>But I can only
summon them</i>

00:22.384 --> 00:23.599
<i>when I have their names,</i>

00:23.687 --> 00:25.503
<i>something that's proving
to be a challenge.</i>

00:25.614 --> 00:27.029
<i>The Prime Order wants me
dead,</i>

00:27.117 --> 00:28.357
<i>but I've found sanctuary</i>

00:28.444 --> 00:29.655
<i>at the farthest edge 
of the Realm</i>

00:29.743 --> 00:31.929
<i>in a place known
as the Outpost.</i>

00:32.023 --> 00:33.585
<i>Previously, on</i>
"The Outpost"...

00:33.816 --> 00:36.153
You are now
the Blade of The Three.

00:36.241 --> 00:39.194
- My purpose is clear.
- I thought you were dead.

00:44.322 --> 00:46.100
Garret,
put the sword down!

00:46.188 --> 00:47.272
What have I done?

00:47.360 --> 00:49.673
You're making colipsum
inside the Outpost walls

00:49.761 --> 00:52.181
- with live Plaguelings?
- Tell me where Talon is.

00:52.269 --> 00:53.518
She left 
for the Shrine of Vor-Anden.

00:53.605 --> 00:55.027
The key should
unlock what we came for.

00:55.114 --> 00:57.230
- Is that what I think it was?
- It's a Kinj.

00:57.318 --> 01:00.003
I've held up my end.
I'm here for my family.

01:00.091 --> 01:01.855
I killed them 
years ago.

01:03.790 --> 01:05.667
- Open the portal.
- Mind control?

01:05.792 --> 01:07.197
So that's
what your Kinj does.

01:07.285 --> 01:09.644
I can't believe
I've been so stupid.

02:08.122 --> 02:11.589
A woman traveling alone
at the border road.

02:11.738 --> 02:13.123
That's not very smart.

02:13.210 --> 02:15.902
I'm just resting.
I'll be on my way soon.

02:16.277 --> 02:18.183
We'll escort you
to the way station.

02:18.402 --> 02:20.386
Thank you, but
I'm heading the other way.

02:20.474 --> 02:23.003
The next border camp
is two days from here.

02:23.190 --> 02:24.707
It's a dangerous country.

02:24.795 --> 02:26.066
I'm fine on my own.

02:29.814 --> 02:31.378
Arrest her.

02:32.699 --> 02:35.384
The Three are looking for
a woman with black blood.

02:35.472 --> 02:37.238
There's a reward
and promotion.

02:37.573 --> 02:39.337
I guess
it's my lucky day.

02:40.189 --> 02:43.871
The reward is the same
dead or alive.

02:44.664 --> 02:45.897
It's your choice.

Mother's going to kill me
when she finds out

03:09.739 --> 03:11.894
I'm leading you straight
to her colipsum farm.

03:12.686 --> 03:15.097
May I ask why you're doing
so against your own mother?

03:15.422 --> 03:17.893
You outlawed colipsum
for good reason, Your Majesty.

03:18.028 --> 03:19.964
It's a scourge
that must be stopped,

03:20.082 --> 03:23.564
which is more important to me
than pleasing that woman.

03:23.677 --> 03:25.894
Yes, well,
knowing Elinor as I do,

03:26.113 --> 03:28.402
- it's very brave of you.
- Not so brave.

03:28.497 --> 03:30.046
Didn't you say
she has the plague now?

03:30.135 --> 03:33.644
Yes, Baron, but I have every
intention of finding a cure.

03:34.304 --> 03:36.699
And when I do,
she'll kill me.

03:47.571 --> 03:48.925
Here it is.

03:59.385 --> 04:00.808
Look at this.

04:06.552 --> 04:08.558
- Hey, look here.
- It's Mother's vault.

04:10.689 --> 04:12.324
Send for the mining foreman.

04:12.622 --> 04:14.574
He'll have a way
to drill it open.

04:16.445 --> 04:18.456
I hereby claim
every iece of dirty money

04:18.543 --> 04:21.003
illegally profited at
the expense of my people.

04:21.510 --> 04:23.035
And burn the rest.

04:26.243 --> 04:28.605
Don't look so glum, Janzo.
You've done well.

04:29.316 --> 04:31.480
Can I at least do my
research more freely now

04:31.568 --> 04:33.949
without some stupid
guard watching over me?

04:34.066 --> 04:36.652
The charges against you
for freeing Naya remain,

04:36.740 --> 04:39.040
but I suppose
the guards are unnecessary.

04:59.345 --> 05:01.441
Hail to The Three.

05:03.611 --> 05:04.958
Well done, Captain.

05:05.271 --> 05:06.605
You apprehended
my prisoner.

05:06.797 --> 05:09.152
- Your prisoner?
- The Blade of the Three.

05:09.617 --> 05:11.324
- Are you now?
- Mm.

05:13.224 --> 05:14.949
The east wind is cold.

05:15.899 --> 05:17.964
But it clears
the morning mist.

05:20.005 --> 05:21.746
Welcome,
Covenant brother.

05:22.157 --> 05:24.910
We'll bring her in together
and share in the glory.

05:32.701 --> 05:34.368
It doesn't say
who sent it.

05:37.439 --> 05:40.011
It is addressed to Her
Majesty, Queen Rosmund.

05:40.550 --> 05:41.829
Hmm.

05:41.994 --> 05:44.853
Exactly how an enemy
might label a box of poison

05:45.243 --> 05:46.571
or a deadly snake.

05:47.106 --> 05:50.134
I'll open it.
Stand back.

06:11.948 --> 06:13.715
"Loyal to the crown".

06:17.948 --> 06:19.361
A wolf.

06:20.728 --> 06:22.681
It's the symbol of
the Moor clans.

06:23.226 --> 06:25.208
Must be from
Baroness Winnowmere.

06:25.978 --> 06:27.148
We have another ally.

06:27.236 --> 06:29.002
The mountains are only
just beginning to thaw.

06:29.089 --> 06:30.454
She can't march to us yet.

06:30.559 --> 06:32.095
Nonetheless,
it's working.

06:32.224 --> 06:33.429
With Milus's men added,

06:33.517 --> 06:35.611
people are starting to have hope
that we might win.

06:36.072 --> 06:39.056
And still others will follow,
Your Majesty.

06:39.993 --> 06:41.337
Yes.

06:42.407 --> 06:44.220
I'm starting to believe they will.

06:50.865 --> 06:52.681
How could you let your mother

06:52.769 --> 06:55.181
sleep in this hovel?

06:56.221 --> 06:59.165
Bedding's about
as soft as daggers.

06:59.603 --> 07:01.329
It's just a necessary
precaution, Mother,

07:01.556 --> 07:03.032
in case you turn.

07:03.305 --> 07:04.853
About that...

07:05.234 --> 07:07.220
- will it hurt?
- No idea.

07:07.981 --> 07:09.540
Never done it before
to myself.

07:09.634 --> 07:10.955
- Ahh.
- Probably, it will hurt a lot.

07:11.042 --> 07:13.257
Crikey, Janzo,
it's been two days.

07:13.345 --> 07:15.048
When are you gonna cure me?

07:15.867 --> 07:17.118
It's not so simple.

07:17.751 --> 07:20.136
You cured two Plaguelings
simply enough,

07:20.224 --> 07:21.805
and they weren't
even relatives.

07:21.893 --> 07:24.409
Mm, well, neither am I,
remember?

07:24.573 --> 07:26.548
Technically, I'm still adopted.

07:26.726 --> 07:28.704
Don't tempt me
to regret that.

07:28.863 --> 07:31.243
- Fix me!
- I am trying.

07:35.752 --> 07:37.873
Janzo, I can feel it in my throat.

07:37.961 --> 07:40.009
It's taking over,
I know it is.

07:40.101 --> 07:42.283
Stop being so dramatic,
Mother.

07:42.698 --> 07:45.118
I only checked on you
an hour ago.

07:48.366 --> 07:50.087
You paid off, you know?

07:50.542 --> 07:51.814
You're a good investment.

07:51.902 --> 07:53.657
Good investment?

07:54.220 --> 07:57.103
That's just the words a boy longs
to hear from his mother, isn't it?

07:57.212 --> 07:59.795
You think it was easy
raising you in this place?

07:59.946 --> 08:02.782
You know, Munt was bigger
than me when I took him on,

08:02.870 --> 08:04.642
which meant that
he could feed himself,

08:04.730 --> 08:07.876
he could put himself to bed,
he could bathe himself.

08:07.986 --> 08:10.047
Not that he really bathed,
but you get what I mean.

08:10.142 --> 08:13.051
He was useful,
whereas you...

08:13.236 --> 08:15.747
you were
a useless baby.

08:15.835 --> 08:19.806
All you ever did was eat and puke
and scream your bloody lungs out.

08:19.894 --> 08:21.546
There was many a time
when I thought

08:21.634 --> 08:22.814
I should sell you off.

08:22.902 --> 08:26.361
- As you so often remind me.
- Yeah, but the point is...

08:26.760 --> 08:28.532
I didn't.

08:28.846 --> 08:30.775
I saw something in you.

08:33.265 --> 08:36.215
There was this one time
I remember when you were,

08:36.457 --> 08:40.812
oh, you were about six,
and you caught the swine pox.

08:40.900 --> 08:43.280
Covered in sores, you were.
Sick as a dog.

08:43.407 --> 08:46.383
All the other kids in all the other towns,
they're all dying of it.

08:46.854 --> 08:48.734
Imagine what I thought.
What a waste.

08:48.930 --> 08:50.511
Six years of
puke and vomit,

08:50.598 --> 08:52.625
and just nothing but
a dead boy to bury.

08:52.713 --> 08:54.195
I remember that.

08:54.898 --> 08:57.286
The sores itched and burned
so badly

08:57.374 --> 08:59.156
I thought
I was going to die.

08:59.526 --> 09:02.281
What I'm saying is,
though, is that you didn't.

09:02.584 --> 09:06.334
All those other kids,
they laid down and died, but not you.

09:06.616 --> 09:09.765
You didn't sit down
or lie down at all.

09:09.938 --> 09:11.545
'Cause it hurt too much.

09:11.633 --> 09:13.254
You don't remember,
do you?

09:15.586 --> 09:19.070
- Remember what?
- You roamed the Nightshade

09:20.130 --> 09:23.406
looking for something,
anything to make it go away.

09:24.097 --> 09:28.014
You poured booze and
broth all over yourself.

09:28.109 --> 09:30.328
You went...
you went searching for...

09:30.484 --> 09:32.623
for leaves and weed and dirt.

09:32.711 --> 09:34.485
I thought
you'd gone mad.

09:35.053 --> 09:38.485
And then one morning...
one morning, you turn up

09:39.117 --> 09:41.102
covered head to toe...

09:41.213 --> 09:42.664
in Horse manure.

09:42.752 --> 09:44.945
Yeah, you remember?
Horse manure.

09:45.088 --> 09:47.467
You smelled like a sick horse.

09:47.555 --> 09:49.797
You'd smeared it
all over your body.

09:49.885 --> 09:52.610
You made me sit outside
in the stables.

09:52.740 --> 09:54.925
Well, I couldn't very well
let you in the bar, could I?

09:55.013 --> 09:56.295
It would be bad
for business.

09:56.383 --> 09:58.600
The thing is, those sores,
they went away

09:58.688 --> 10:00.451
that very same day.
You got better.

10:00.539 --> 10:01.694
Do you remember
what I did then?

10:01.781 --> 10:04.451
Then I spread the horse
manure on all of my friends.

10:04.539 --> 10:07.456
Yeah, you made all of them
better as well!

10:07.566 --> 10:10.649
Because it's the germs
in the fecal matter,

10:10.737 --> 10:13.600
well, well then they,
they overpower the swine pox...

10:13.688 --> 10:15.117
- You see?
- Yes, you see?

10:15.406 --> 10:16.992
Clever brain.

10:19.032 --> 10:21.617
It was then that
I decided not to sell you,

10:21.889 --> 10:24.328
and you trained.

10:24.493 --> 10:27.076
You trained with Tunney
the master brewer,

10:27.163 --> 10:28.445
and the rest is history.

10:29.289 --> 10:31.373
Your ale made
the Nightshade famous,

10:31.461 --> 10:34.583
and I made you
my master brewer.

10:34.670 --> 10:37.360
A ten-year-old boy!

10:38.201 --> 10:40.287
"He's a good investment",
I said to myself.

10:40.375 --> 10:42.490
And that is true now

10:42.578 --> 10:44.979
as the first day
I ever said it.

10:48.355 --> 10:49.985
Thank you, Mum.

10:51.117 --> 10:52.766
- Thank you.
- Janzo.

10:53.169 --> 10:56.654
What I'm trying to
say is I know sometimes

10:56.765 --> 10:58.250
I haven't been
very nice to you.

10:58.345 --> 11:00.602
I know sometimes
I've said things like

11:00.689 --> 11:01.914
I wish you were dead,

11:02.002 --> 11:04.377
or you're not worth
your weight in straw,

11:04.465 --> 11:07.024
or you're as ugly as
a cockroach.

11:08.025 --> 11:10.086
But I never really meant
those things.

11:14.146 --> 11:15.586
Yes, you did.

11:17.140 --> 11:21.324
Janzo,
if you get me out of this,

11:21.849 --> 11:23.030
I'll be better to you.

11:23.117 --> 11:27.117
- I promise, you'll see.
- No, you won't.

11:30.157 --> 11:32.205
Mother, they found your
colipsum farm and burned it,

11:32.315 --> 11:34.797
- and then Gwynn took all your money.
- What?

11:37.458 --> 11:39.806
- You snitched.
- I certainly did.

11:40.089 --> 11:42.638
People are dying from that colipsum.

11:42.726 --> 11:44.726
- You...
- Ah!

11:47.195 --> 11:49.398
You wouldn't want to spend
the rest of your life in that cage

11:49.485 --> 11:51.938
and turn into a Plagueling,
now would you?

11:54.709 --> 11:59.102
You're right, my son,
my brilliant boy.

12:00.887 --> 12:03.102
That colipsum absolutely
had to be destroyed,

12:03.189 --> 12:05.504
and it took a soul as
brave and brilliant as you

12:05.591 --> 12:06.973
to make it happen.

12:07.414 --> 12:09.127
That's why I love you.

12:10.903 --> 12:12.351
Because you're good

12:14.578 --> 12:16.195
and you're scrupulous.

12:17.791 --> 12:19.469
Something
I could never be.

12:21.435 --> 12:22.891
Your Majesty.

12:24.643 --> 12:27.292
Your Majesty,
we stopped a man at the gate.

12:27.379 --> 12:29.094
He claims to be
your close relation.

12:29.181 --> 12:31.000
I have no close relations.

12:31.469 --> 12:33.953
- What's his name?
- He calls himself Alton.

12:37.111 --> 12:39.478
Take me to him,
immediately.

12:54.967 --> 12:56.687
Sister.

13:05.059 --> 13:07.453
Nothing to say
to your long lost baby brother?

13:07.603 --> 13:10.164
My brother was executed along
with the rest of my family.

13:10.252 --> 13:12.667
Actually, thank the gods,
that's not true.

13:12.920 --> 13:14.508
I was spirited away like
you were.

13:14.596 --> 13:17.383
I was swapped for the court
scribe's son who looked like me.

13:17.765 --> 13:19.258
But Calkussar never
mentioned you.

13:19.346 --> 13:20.394
Surely he would have said
something.

13:20.481 --> 13:21.862
I was never told
about you, either.

13:22.171 --> 13:23.703
We were probably safer
that way.

13:24.230 --> 13:26.388
I only heard about you
when you sent word to the Cormacks

13:26.475 --> 13:28.134
calling them to join you
against the Prime Order.

13:28.221 --> 13:30.227
You were raised
by the Cormacks?

13:30.315 --> 13:32.999
Not quite. As I said,
I became the son of a scribe

13:33.087 --> 13:34.985
who took a court position
with Regis Cormack.

13:35.073 --> 13:39.039
Well, must we go over the
boring details now, Rozie?

13:39.735 --> 13:43.352
Rozie?
That's what he used to call me.

13:43.691 --> 13:45.124
He?

13:46.673 --> 13:48.339
It's me, Rozie.

13:50.741 --> 13:53.961
- Is it?
- Of course it is.

13:56.085 --> 13:58.672
You say it is.
Now what?

14:01.016 --> 14:02.617
I don't know, actually.

14:02.995 --> 14:04.508
I'm just happy to see you.

14:05.485 --> 14:07.320
Give me a hug, sister.

14:08.087 --> 14:10.664
This is all very overwhelming.

14:10.781 --> 14:12.235
I understand.

14:13.612 --> 14:16.055
Take your time.
Let it sink in.

14:16.785 --> 14:20.434
Just give me a place to sleep,
and we'll get reacquainted.

14:21.101 --> 14:22.815
Is something wrong?

14:24.909 --> 14:27.464
You'll pardon me if I won't
simply relinquish my throne

14:27.552 --> 14:29.139
to some stranger.

14:29.227 --> 14:31.000
Who said anything
about a throne?

14:31.323 --> 14:33.828
I'm just happy to be
reunited with my big sister.

14:33.945 --> 14:35.133
Oh, come on.

14:35.536 --> 14:38.649
If you are who you say you are,
then the throne belongs to you.

14:39.282 --> 14:41.998
All I ask is that you
spend some time with me.

14:42.288 --> 14:44.655
I'm sure you'll see that
I'm telling the truth.

14:46.183 --> 14:50.211
You know that if you're
lying, you'll die for it.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.391
So think carefully.

14:53.271 --> 14:54.539
I will give you
one chance

14:54.627 --> 14:57.728
to change your mind
and remove your claim.

15:01.106 --> 15:04.250
I am your brother Alton. I swear it.

15:04.943 --> 15:08.094
- Do you have any proof?
- Wait.

15:08.780 --> 15:10.156
I have this.

15:15.949 --> 15:17.296
This was Father's.

15:17.461 --> 15:18.777
He never went anywhere
without it.

15:18.864 --> 15:22.414
Yes. I took it with me
when I was spirited away.

15:25.597 --> 15:26.977
It can't be.

15:27.598 --> 15:30.125
I thought the same thing
when I heard about you.

15:31.160 --> 15:32.586
If you are Alton,

15:32.674 --> 15:35.566
I won't easily forgive myself
for being so hard on you,

15:35.654 --> 15:37.404
but you must understand
my caution.

15:37.492 --> 15:40.586
Of course.
I would do the same.

15:41.478 --> 15:43.078
It's going to take time.

15:45.142 --> 15:47.852
My handmaid will arrange
sleeping quarters for you.

16:16.369 --> 16:19.352
Your mind is not on
anything but that Blackblood.

16:20.953 --> 16:23.672
She has valuable information
about the false queen.

16:24.375 --> 16:26.803
If she dies before
I can interrogate her,

16:27.102 --> 16:29.664
I'd hate having to explain that
to The Three.

16:30.211 --> 16:32.281
Then go on,
interrogate her.

16:32.766 --> 16:34.625
No one's stopping you.

16:51.961 --> 16:53.274
Talon.

16:56.051 --> 16:58.700
You bastard!
How did you escape?

16:58.883 --> 17:01.842
I owe you an apology, but we
really don't have time right now.

17:01.930 --> 17:03.672
If you so much as laid
a finger on Gwynn, I will...

17:03.759 --> 17:05.444
Gwynn is fine.
I need you to calm down

17:05.531 --> 17:06.648
and listen to me.

17:06.772 --> 17:09.477
Janzo fixed my mind.
He told me where you were going.

17:09.565 --> 17:10.931
That's how I found you.

17:13.444 --> 17:14.672
Sorry, Talon.

17:14.760 --> 17:18.313
That punch was weak.

17:18.406 --> 17:21.797
I'm not trying to hurt you, all right?

17:21.906 --> 17:23.558
But you have to help
me make it look good.

17:23.700 --> 17:25.867
I'm supposed to be
interrogating you.

17:30.516 --> 17:32.933
- Are you able to fight?
- Why don't you cut me loose and find out?

17:33.020 --> 17:36.279
Talon, I need to know
how badly you're wounded.

17:36.428 --> 17:39.178
- Can you fight?
- I heal fast, remember?

17:39.864 --> 17:41.660
Good. Now there are
two guards to your left,

17:41.748 --> 17:42.904
and Angbar behind me.

17:42.992 --> 17:45.256
When I cut you loose,
you take them.

17:45.490 --> 17:47.303
I will take the three to your right.

17:48.449 --> 17:50.115
Why should I trust you?

17:51.091 --> 17:52.826
You don't have a choice.

17:55.318 --> 17:56.951
This time,
help me sell it.

17:58.051 --> 17:59.521
Act like I'm cutting you.

18:02.272 --> 18:05.922
Talon!

18:06.086 --> 18:08.161
- Ow!
- All right, don't overdo it.

18:08.597 --> 18:10.403
Okay? I'm supposed to be
interrogating you,

18:10.491 --> 18:11.864
not hacking you apart.

18:11.952 --> 18:13.967
First you want more, now you
want less? Make up your mind.

18:14.054 --> 18:15.786
Just act.

18:20.428 --> 18:21.856
Just so you know,

18:22.170 --> 18:24.145
after I kill all of them,
I'm going to kill you.

18:24.395 --> 18:25.489
No, you're not

18:25.582 --> 18:26.981
because you're smarter than
that.

18:27.147 --> 18:29.062
I'm either on their side
or yours.

18:29.263 --> 18:30.887
It can't be both.

18:31.467 --> 18:35.918
Now, after I cut your
wrists, be ready to fight.

18:36.216 --> 18:38.348
You want the sword of the dagger?

18:38.436 --> 18:39.833
You take the sword.

18:40.253 --> 18:42.262
You're no good with a knife.

18:42.753 --> 18:44.799
Same old Talon.

18:51.446 --> 18:53.779
Hey. Hey!

18:54.973 --> 18:57.589
Get them!

18:57.879 --> 18:59.346
Stop them!

19:52.166 --> 19:53.798
Hyah! Hyah!

20:08.186 --> 20:09.522
Gods, Rozie.

20:10.006 --> 20:12.506
Seeing you face to face
is bringing all the memories back.

20:12.594 --> 20:13.803
Hm.

20:14.818 --> 20:17.389
Do you remember
the gardener had a dog?

20:18.147 --> 20:21.756
- What was his name?
- Marbles.

20:22.664 --> 20:24.428
And it was a cat,
not a dog.

20:25.639 --> 20:28.951
Hey, do you remember when
we tied a fork to his tail?

20:29.139 --> 20:30.662
It drove him batty.

20:30.881 --> 20:32.188
He almost chewed
his own tail off

20:32.275 --> 20:36.185
- before Danomar untied it.
- Oh, yes. Danomar.

20:38.910 --> 20:39.994
You called for me?

20:40.082 --> 20:42.328
Master Tobin, there's someone
I'd like you to meet.

20:42.561 --> 20:44.215
And who is this brawny fellow?

20:44.303 --> 20:46.412
This is Tobin.
He's acting as base commander,

20:46.499 --> 20:48.814
and my loyal friend.

20:48.901 --> 20:50.701
Hmm. Well met, Tobin.

20:50.789 --> 20:52.603
Thank you for supporting
my sister's claim.

20:53.006 --> 20:54.654
Did you just say "sister"?

20:54.951 --> 20:58.193
Yes. I'm Prince Alton, son of Ranulf.

20:58.286 --> 21:01.169
You have a brother?
But how?

21:01.809 --> 21:04.170
He says he survived
just like I did.

21:04.258 --> 21:06.014
But how do you know
it's really him?

21:07.814 --> 21:11.318
I lied to mother once because you
were afraid Father would be angry.

21:11.895 --> 21:13.248
What had you done?

21:19.060 --> 21:21.713
I stole a ham from the
quartermaster's cart

21:21.958 --> 21:23.714
and ate it under the stairwell.

21:23.973 --> 21:26.974
- We were awful, weren't we?
- Do you remember the coachman

21:27.062 --> 21:28.776
who always gave us
sweets from his pocket?

21:29.076 --> 21:30.599
The red ones
with a nut in the middle.

21:30.687 --> 21:32.979
Oh, yes.
What a strange little man.

21:33.074 --> 21:36.904
But if he's the only son,
wouldn't he replace you as heir?

21:37.419 --> 21:41.219
Oh, quite so.
Though he's not yet of age.

21:41.556 --> 21:42.873
When will you turn 18?

21:42.960 --> 21:44.120
The ninth of the second moon.

21:44.298 --> 21:45.900
The Festival of
Constellations, actually.

21:45.988 --> 21:48.181
And we shall celebrate
grandly this season.

21:49.026 --> 21:51.470
But I have scads of
orders to get through,

21:51.558 --> 21:53.297
so if it's not too rude,
I should get back to it.

21:53.384 --> 21:55.317
Hmm. No problem at all.

22:03.909 --> 22:05.611
Bye, Rozie.

22:13.775 --> 22:14.945
Rozie?

22:15.033 --> 22:17.697
Oh, not now, Tobin.
I really do have work to do.

22:40.607 --> 22:42.236
To the postmaster immediately.

22:52.737 --> 22:54.240
Talon, I need you to know

22:54.352 --> 22:57.045
that that was not really me
that tried to kill you.

22:57.469 --> 22:59.462
They completely altered my mind.

22:59.963 --> 23:01.275
I know.

23:02.079 --> 23:03.968
You saved me when you
could have easily killed me.

23:04.055 --> 23:07.142
- So Janzo really cured you?
- Yes, he did.

23:07.942 --> 23:09.619
The man's a genius.

23:10.104 --> 23:13.494
Still makes me uneasy that they
turned you into a cold-blooded killer.

23:14.326 --> 23:16.681
I think if there's one thing
I've learned in all this,

23:17.135 --> 23:19.869
maybe I was always a
cold-blooded killer.

23:20.655 --> 23:24.978
They just pointed my rage
in the wrong direction.

23:29.550 --> 23:31.064
Wait, what are you doing?

23:31.205 --> 23:32.775
The Outpost is that way.

23:33.196 --> 23:34.842
I have to go back
to the Capital.

23:35.048 --> 23:36.775
- Why?
- I have to stop...

23:37.851 --> 23:39.697
the people who did this to me.

23:39.918 --> 23:42.119
So is that why
you came looking for me?

23:43.570 --> 23:45.345
So you could get your revenge?

23:46.058 --> 23:48.107
Someone has to stop them,
Talon.

23:48.210 --> 23:49.751
So what are you going to do?

23:50.048 --> 23:52.455
Ride into the Capital and
kill everyone yourself?

23:52.543 --> 23:55.851
No. Just the ones
who did this to me,

23:55.947 --> 23:57.326
and the ones who tried to get me

23:57.423 --> 24:00.447
to kill Gwynn and you.

24:02.182 --> 24:04.564
The ones who made me
kill my own father.

24:04.983 --> 24:06.416
Wythers?

24:07.897 --> 24:09.353
He didn't have your black blood

24:09.441 --> 24:11.587
to help him survive
a blade to the gut

24:13.032 --> 24:14.712
wielded by his own son.

24:18.477 --> 24:19.962
I'm sorry, Garret.

24:23.127 --> 24:25.626
I need you to help me
make things right.

24:27.349 --> 24:29.148
The Garret I knew
wouldn't do something

24:29.236 --> 24:30.585
so rash and stupid
to get even.

24:30.673 --> 24:32.931
Then I guess I'm not the Garret
you knew.

24:33.314 --> 24:35.540
Talon, I don't think
I will ever be the same again.

24:36.017 --> 24:38.619
Certainly not until I can
face them once and for all,

24:38.730 --> 24:42.998
and I cannot do that
without your help.

24:45.827 --> 24:49.048
- So what's the plan?
- Don't really have one.

24:50.669 --> 24:53.072
This keeps getting
better and better.

25:04.099 --> 25:05.486
I missed you.

25:08.791 --> 25:10.251
I know.

25:14.055 --> 25:16.345
I'm back, and I brought
you your favorites to eat,

25:16.433 --> 25:18.734
and a new idea
for treatment options.

25:23.523 --> 25:25.087
Oh, dear.

25:32.662 --> 25:34.798
What am I missing?

25:39.793 --> 25:41.851
- Hmm.
- The two Plaguelings I cured

25:41.939 --> 25:44.423
were lying out in the sun for hours.

25:44.739 --> 25:46.858
Something tells me
it's these flowers,

25:46.946 --> 25:48.986
although I've tried
every combination.

25:49.965 --> 25:52.259
It's not the vines,
it's not the flowers,

25:52.347 --> 25:54.056
it's not the soil
that was underneath it.

25:54.144 --> 25:55.178
Nothing.

26:03.591 --> 26:05.861
I think it's safe
to rule out the sun.

26:12.495 --> 26:14.315
- You asked for me?
- Yes, I want to review

26:14.403 --> 26:15.775
a possible strategy with you.

26:15.868 --> 26:17.908
Shouldn't Alton be here to decide,

26:18.180 --> 26:19.884
since he's your future king?

26:20.026 --> 26:22.853
Does it somehow disappoint
you that my brother,

26:22.970 --> 26:25.452
my own flesh and blood,
might not have been murdered

26:25.540 --> 26:27.328
by the Prime Order after all?

26:27.697 --> 26:29.531
Does that possibility
somehow displease you?

26:29.618 --> 26:32.882
Please, Rosmund, I didn't mean it
like that. I just find it hard...

26:32.970 --> 26:35.675
Do you feel like your royal
legacy is slipping away from you?

26:35.899 --> 26:38.410
Well, perhaps your plan should have
been to marry him instead of me.

26:38.498 --> 26:40.507
My plan isn't to marry you,

26:40.671 --> 26:42.303
at least not for the
reasons you're implying.

26:42.390 --> 26:44.190
Only for the reason that
I've fallen...

26:48.151 --> 26:49.951
I've fallen in love with you.

26:55.527 --> 26:57.483
Well, that's good to know.

26:58.639 --> 27:00.187
Just answer me this.

27:01.423 --> 27:03.858
Do you believe
he really is your brother?

27:04.616 --> 27:06.567
I really want him to be.

27:07.038 --> 27:09.562
- That's not what I asked you.
- Look, I'm not a fool, Tobin.

27:10.158 --> 27:12.319
There are bound to be
pretenders of the throne.

27:12.827 --> 27:15.185
But the things he knows,
the way he talks,

27:15.273 --> 27:17.148
he even sound like Alton.

27:17.314 --> 27:19.830
He really knows things that
my mother used to say to us.

27:20.098 --> 27:22.288
And, well,
he has my father's cane.

27:22.376 --> 27:24.827
I have no more reason to doubt
him than he has to doubt me.

27:24.915 --> 27:27.085
You had Calkussar to bolster
your claim.

27:27.173 --> 27:30.585
This guy walks into the Outpost
alone with a story and a cane?

27:30.673 --> 27:33.062
His adopted father died in a fire.

27:33.413 --> 27:35.007
Who would you expect him
to come with?

27:35.125 --> 27:37.563
Why are you so eager to get rid
of the only family I have left?

27:37.650 --> 27:38.921
Because whether he is
your brother or not,

27:39.008 --> 27:40.615
I do not want him to be king.

27:41.781 --> 27:44.452
I don't want him to be king
because I want you to be queen,

27:45.061 --> 27:46.640
whether I'm by your side or not.

27:48.412 --> 27:51.210
You're wise, you're fair,

27:51.465 --> 27:53.514
and you're honorable.

27:53.889 --> 27:56.040
That's another very good answer.

27:59.494 --> 28:00.976
Mm-mm.

28:02.557 --> 28:04.851
It doesn't matter
how many times you kiss me.

28:05.743 --> 28:09.780
I'm not gonna risk my life and the
lives of my people for a kid that...

28:11.155 --> 28:13.335
Really?
No matter how many times?

28:14.483 --> 28:16.092
Well...

28:17.172 --> 28:18.839
never say never.

29:33.009 --> 29:34.726
Mother!

29:35.066 --> 29:36.749
Mother?

30:03.439 --> 30:04.992
Mother?

30:05.310 --> 30:07.312
Mother?

30:10.826 --> 30:14.130
- Mum?
- Pig's figs, what happened?

30:14.917 --> 30:17.777
- It's you!
- Of course it's bloody me.

30:17.865 --> 30:19.714
Who else would it be?

30:19.802 --> 30:22.693
I did it! I found the cure!

30:22.832 --> 30:25.613
What have you done to
my face? It's on fire!

30:25.701 --> 30:27.483
It was the sting-flies
that feed on the flowers!

30:27.570 --> 30:28.512
That's what it was!

30:28.599 --> 30:30.684
Their venom must be poisonous
to Plagueling parasites.

30:30.771 --> 30:32.388
I'm a bloody genius!
Boy, do you owe me.

30:32.476 --> 30:34.411
Do you owe me, Mother.

30:34.499 --> 30:35.998
First, I've got to go and tell Gwynn

30:36.085 --> 30:37.532
that I just single-handedly saved

30:37.619 --> 30:39.474
- the entire Outpost kingdom.
- Janzo.

30:39.562 --> 30:40.524
Then I've got to go and get

30:40.611 --> 30:42.170
- all of these more flies.
- Janzo. Ow.

30:42.257 --> 30:43.631
- I love you. I'll see you in a bit!
- Janzo.

30:43.718 --> 30:46.251
- Janzo!
- I'll be back!

30:46.339 --> 30:49.173
Janzo!

30:53.619 --> 30:56.654
Damn sting-flies have to
sleep at night, don't they?

30:56.749 --> 30:59.652
They can't just conveniently
be sleeping during the daytime

30:59.740 --> 31:01.427
when I can come out and grab them then?

31:01.530 --> 31:03.373
No, that would be way too easy.

31:06.491 --> 31:08.592
Where are you?

32:11.132 --> 32:12.459
No.

32:26.897 --> 32:29.813
Elinor?

32:29.955 --> 32:31.588
Oh, cut me loose.

32:31.688 --> 32:34.103
I didn't believe Janzo when
he said he'd found a cure.

32:34.191 --> 32:38.508
- I had to see it for myself.
- Well, now you've seen it.

32:38.712 --> 32:40.245
Cut me loose.

32:44.369 --> 32:47.118
Your face looks very painful.

32:47.565 --> 32:50.407
Leave it to my genius son

32:50.611 --> 32:55.190
to find the most unpleasant
cure in the world.

33:03.868 --> 33:05.350
Thank you very much.

33:05.538 --> 33:10.229
Thank you. Well, I'll be off then.

33:10.317 --> 33:13.233
Not so fast.
Now that you're cured,

33:13.321 --> 33:15.025
you can serve a proper sentence.

33:15.113 --> 33:18.863
What? Oh, come on now.

33:19.023 --> 33:20.905
I mean, all's well that ends well.

33:21.063 --> 33:23.113
Everything turned out
for the better, didn't it?

33:23.201 --> 33:25.806
Not for those that lost their
life to this Plagueling epidemic.

33:25.894 --> 33:30.211
They knew the risks of
taking colipsum, didn't they?

33:30.299 --> 33:33.533
And anyway, Janzo's found a cure.

33:33.761 --> 33:36.049
You will stand trial
like any other criminal.

33:36.188 --> 33:38.103
And you colipsum
earnings will, of course,

33:38.191 --> 33:39.947
be forfeited to the crown.

33:43.781 --> 33:45.510
That money is mine.

33:46.003 --> 33:50.877
I earned that, every last bead.

33:51.031 --> 33:52.558
I told you from the start

33:52.646 --> 33:54.385
that your criminal days were over.

33:54.712 --> 33:56.794
You are guilty
of skimming taxes

33:56.928 --> 33:58.702
and selling and
manufacturing a substance

33:58.790 --> 34:00.146
I specifically outlawed.

34:00.348 --> 34:02.181
Take her to prison.

34:05.065 --> 34:07.299
After everything
I've done for you?

34:07.800 --> 34:09.971
You cannot do this to me.

34:10.059 --> 34:12.103
You can't do this to me!

34:12.217 --> 34:14.132
No, let me go!

34:14.219 --> 34:16.635
No! Let me go!

34:17.322 --> 34:19.719
Your Majesty, come quickly.

34:19.862 --> 34:22.774
- What is it?
- You have to see it.

34:33.572 --> 34:35.253
I've brought you some new recruits,

34:35.341 --> 34:37.822
and a cure for the rest.

34:38.112 --> 34:40.714
- It's remarkable.
- Aren't I?

34:53.533 --> 34:55.518
That's not her. Let her through.

34:55.942 --> 34:59.526
We are looking for a young woman...
murdered a man.

34:59.722 --> 35:02.805
She's thin, long black hair.

35:02.893 --> 35:05.459
Has anyone seen her?

35:16.095 --> 35:17.676
Let us through.

35:19.382 --> 35:22.707
Covenant Operations.
You'll see it's all official.

35:24.189 --> 35:26.113
Is this the device
I've been hearing about?

35:26.267 --> 35:29.410
- Just let us pass.
- Could I just take a quick peek?

35:29.498 --> 35:30.801
I'll be fast.

35:33.683 --> 35:36.073
Huh. I thought it would be bigger.

35:36.161 --> 35:39.004
A lot of damage wrapped
in a small package.

35:52.216 --> 35:54.732
So the sting-fly antidote
venom acts very quickly,

35:54.820 --> 35:56.735
so our Plagueling troubles are over.

35:56.922 --> 35:58.803
And I also returned
Garret to his typical

35:58.890 --> 36:01.238
boorish mental state for you.
You're welcome.

36:01.809 --> 36:04.208
There's one more thing,
Your Majesty.

36:04.785 --> 36:07.137
I betrayed my own mother
to support the crown.

36:07.395 --> 36:10.915
And your recent work has been
nothing short of heroic, Janzo.

36:11.002 --> 36:12.441
I agree.

36:13.279 --> 36:14.957
I assume all is forgiven.

36:15.136 --> 36:17.384
Your efforts don't
make up for being a traitor.

36:17.808 --> 36:20.523
- You're lucky to be alive.
- I am not a traitor.

36:20.706 --> 36:21.957
Who are you?

36:22.093 --> 36:24.244
You aided
the escape of a traitor.

36:24.332 --> 36:26.457
- That in itself is treason.
- Your Majesty,

36:26.545 --> 36:28.566
she was only doing it
to protect her family.

36:28.654 --> 36:31.179
She freed Everit Dred,
our most hated enemy,

36:31.267 --> 36:33.369
and by doing so,
cost many lives.

36:33.573 --> 36:35.611
By law, she should pay
with her own.

36:35.871 --> 36:39.234
What good is killing someone?
How will they ever make amends?

36:39.321 --> 36:40.445
I'm sorry, but I would do it

36:40.533 --> 36:42.111
all over again
if I had the chance.

36:42.199 --> 36:45.293
- You're only making it worse for yourself.
- Who is he?

36:45.381 --> 36:47.501
Janzo, for all the good
you've done for this Outpost,

36:47.597 --> 36:48.642
I will spare your life.

36:48.729 --> 36:51.018
Finally, someone making
some sense around here.

36:51.105 --> 36:52.524
I'm assuming
I'm free to go.

36:52.611 --> 36:54.480
The impertinent scamp thinks
we'll let him off

36:54.567 --> 36:55.853
completely free and clear.

36:55.941 --> 36:57.824
"We" will not be making
any decisions.

36:57.912 --> 37:00.160
He committed treason.
There is no worse crime.

37:00.248 --> 37:02.121
Oh, I'm not so sure about that.

37:02.209 --> 37:03.640
I mean,
I could think of a few things.

37:03.727 --> 37:07.340
Maybe, um,
murder, rape, torture!

37:07.428 --> 37:08.789
- Janzo.
- Who are you?

37:08.877 --> 37:10.290
What have I ever done
to you, you little...

37:10.377 --> 37:12.466
Regardless of all the good
you've done for this Outpost,

37:12.553 --> 37:14.988
you still committed treason
against the throne.

37:16.028 --> 37:18.270
It can't go completely
unpunished.

37:18.574 --> 37:20.384
Take him to prison.

37:24.913 --> 37:27.108
I don't even know who
you are anymore, Gwynn.

37:27.195 --> 37:29.750
Actually, I think you'll
find her name is Rosmund.

37:55.031 --> 37:56.613
Well, well, well.

37:56.778 --> 37:58.693
Look who's had a taste
of his own medicine.

37:58.780 --> 38:00.195
Can you believe it, Mother?

38:00.282 --> 38:02.176
After all I've done for that woman.

38:02.342 --> 38:03.941
Listen, when you pick sides,

38:04.029 --> 38:05.450
make sure
you get something out of it.

38:05.537 --> 38:08.453
That...
is the law of the streets.

38:08.657 --> 38:10.415
I don't choose sides.

38:10.752 --> 38:12.065
I just do what's right.

38:12.153 --> 38:14.106
That's why
you don't have any friends.

38:15.258 --> 38:16.652
All those years
I raised you,

38:16.740 --> 38:18.668
you didn't learn anything, did you?

38:18.832 --> 38:22.121
On the contrary, Mother.
You taught me everything.

38:22.570 --> 38:25.988
- Hmm.
- By showing me how not to live my life.

38:42.518 --> 38:45.047
You know what, Janzo?
I'm the only family you've got.

38:45.135 --> 38:46.535
Just remember that.

38:49.237 --> 38:51.304
It's your fault
we're in here.

39:19.071 --> 39:20.559
Put it in there.

39:22.752 --> 39:24.848
Looks like the guards are
more focused on people getting out

39:24.936 --> 39:26.158
than getting in.

39:30.093 --> 39:31.775
Do you think anyone
will recognize you?

39:32.121 --> 39:35.309
Without my armor?
No, not likely.

39:35.531 --> 39:38.371
We'll be fine.
Just stick to the story.

39:39.146 --> 39:42.106
- I don't like your story.
- Nonsense, it's perfect.

39:42.194 --> 39:44.731
Hold.
What's your business in the Capital?

39:44.819 --> 39:46.949
We're getting married.

39:48.617 --> 39:50.532
- Names?
- Garrison.

39:50.923 --> 39:54.449
- Teela.
- What courthouse? What judge?

40:14.304 --> 40:17.777
My One,
why have you brought me here?

40:20.079 --> 40:23.930
Since your weapon failed
to rid us of the false queen,

40:24.118 --> 40:27.501
I thought you should
see a small demonstration

40:27.589 --> 40:31.106
of the weapon that will replace it.

40:31.194 --> 40:32.942
Watch.

40:33.590 --> 40:37.682
It's the southern... south...
um, south courthouse.

40:37.769 --> 40:42.801
- The south, yes.
- There is no south courthouse.

40:42.974 --> 40:44.207
What judge is bonding you?

40:46.401 --> 40:49.175
- Um, it started
- Um...

40:49.263 --> 40:50.267
with a J, didn't it?

40:50.355 --> 40:51.986
- Yeah, it started...
- ..with a J... a "J".

40:52.073 --> 40:53.300
Or maybe...

40:53.448 --> 40:55.073
..maybe it was an S.

40:55.284 --> 40:57.691
- Judge...
- It started with S.

40:57.806 --> 40:59.964
- "S" name, was the judge.
- Uh...
