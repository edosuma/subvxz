00:41.900 --> 00:43.800
The pool hall is a great equalizer.

00:44.500 --> 00:47.900
In the pool hall, nobody cares about
how old or young you are...

00:48.000 --> 00:51.300
what color your skin is,
or how much money you got in your pocket.

00:51.500 --> 00:53.200
It's about how you move.

00:53.700 --> 00:55.100
I remember this kid once...

00:55.100 --> 00:58.400
who could move on a pool table
like nobody had ever seen.

00:58.400 --> 01:02.100
I mean, hour after hour, rack after rack,
his shots just went in.

01:02.500 --> 01:05.900
The cue was part of his arm,
and the balls had eyes.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.700
And the thing that made him so good...

01:09.200 --> 01:11.500
was he thought he could never miss.

01:12.200 --> 01:13.500
I know...

01:13.800 --> 01:15.500
'cause that kid was me.

01:16.900 --> 01:19.500
What they're doing
is forming this new league...

01:19.500 --> 01:22.000
kind of like what they have
for golf and tennis...

01:21.900 --> 01:23.400
but for pool.

01:23.700 --> 01:26.300
They scouted all the best players
in the country...

01:26.300 --> 01:28.400
for 50 spots on this new pro tour.

01:28.300 --> 01:30.800
Then they made their selections.

01:30.800 --> 01:33.800
Last summer, I was in Memphis
playing Bucktooth for that Chevy.

01:33.800 --> 01:37.300
The tournament director himself
was in the room watching me play.

01:37.400 --> 01:39.500
A guy by the name of Toupee Jay.

01:40.300 --> 01:42.400
Anyway, after playing Bucktooth...

01:42.400 --> 01:44.000
this guy Jay comes up to me...

01:44.100 --> 01:47.200
and he says even though
all 50 spots in the tour are filled...

01:47.100 --> 01:51.400
after watching me play, they'd have to make
an exception in my case to carry 51.

01:53.800 --> 01:56.600
Can you believe that? They want me.

01:56.500 --> 01:59.000
He even told Joe
he'd send the invitation himself.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.300
Man, when I was out there playing...

02:01.700 --> 02:04.800
we had no professionals.
All we had was hustlers.

02:05.800 --> 02:08.199
I don't wanna be a hustler, Rags.

02:08.199 --> 02:10.699
I want to be a professional,
and I'm gonna be.

02:10.699 --> 02:12.700
I'm just waiting for my invitation.

02:14.700 --> 02:16.200
What's going on here?

02:16.800 --> 02:19.100
-We were just--
-We were just what?

02:20.300 --> 02:23.700
You know who this is?
This is Rags, and he's a hustler.

02:23.600 --> 02:27.000
Probably one of the best.
What'd you do? Make him win the first set?

02:26.900 --> 02:30.300
-He's up $20.
-He's $20 up. Right, $20 up.

02:30.300 --> 02:33.000
Then you'd be $50 up, then $100,
then you'd be broke.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.300
Come on, Joe, let me play.
I can beat this guy.

02:35.300 --> 02:37.400
Maybe you can and maybe you can't.

02:37.400 --> 02:39.500
But we don't deal with maybes, do we?

02:39.500 --> 02:42.500
You don't know all the angles yet,
but I do, all right?

02:42.500 --> 02:44.900
He's bad news.
Even if you win, you can't win.

02:44.800 --> 02:48.300
What do you mean, even if I win,
I can't win? I don't understand.

02:48.200 --> 02:50.600
You don't have to understand.
Just listen to me.

02:51.200 --> 02:52.900
If the kid wants to play...

02:52.900 --> 02:55.500
why don't you let him play?
He may learn something.

02:55.400 --> 02:58.500
The only thing he'll learn from you
is how to lose.

02:58.500 --> 03:02.400
I'm trying to do something here.
I'm trying to educate this kid, all right?

03:02.200 --> 03:04.500
So if you got something to say, say it to me.

03:04.500 --> 03:07.900
Otherwise shut the fuck up,
because he's my kid, all right?

03:07.900 --> 03:09.600
He's my fucking kid.

03:10.400 --> 03:14.100
And I'm gonna make him a champion.
So you stay away from him.

03:23.900 --> 03:26.600
-Mail came today, Joe.
-Thanks, Don.

04:21.600 --> 04:24.300
-White boy's got skills.
-No, he can't.

04:46.200 --> 04:47.300
Damn!

04:47.300 --> 04:48.800
Now let me get this straight.

04:48.800 --> 04:52.100
You're saying that
because you and me are friends...

04:52.300 --> 04:54.200
that makes us niggers?

04:54.200 --> 04:58.300
No, "niggas," all right?
There's a big difference.

04:58.900 --> 05:01.100
That's what I just said. "Nigger."

05:01.100 --> 05:03.400
-No. "Nigga."
-"Nigger."

05:03.400 --> 05:05.600
"Nigga," N-l-G-G-A.

05:08.600 --> 05:12.200
-What the fuck is that?
-Man and me, like, we're brothers.

05:12.200 --> 05:15.800
You know, like if I say, "You my nigga,"
that means we're boys.

05:16.000 --> 05:20.200
Like that man you're playing, right there?
That's my nigga Charles.

05:20.500 --> 05:22.200
My nigger Charles, right?

05:22.200 --> 05:25.200
Hold it. See, you can't say that.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.800
-Only I can.
-Why?

05:28.000 --> 05:31.100
Because, first of all, you don't say it right.

05:30.900 --> 05:33.900
And second, you don't know Charles. I do.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.200
-You do?
-I do.

05:35.300 --> 05:37.900
I've known Charles
since he was knee-high to a duck.

05:37.800 --> 05:40.300
See, me and Charles, nigga, we down.

05:40.400 --> 05:42.200
-You're down?
-Yeah, down.

05:42.300 --> 05:46.400
Of course you're down. You're down
about $5,000. Give me my fucking money.

05:49.200 --> 05:50.600
You know what?

05:50.700 --> 05:54.200
It is absolutely impossible
to have an intelligent conversation...

05:54.100 --> 05:55.700
with your white ass.

05:56.100 --> 05:57.700
Shoot pool, honky.

06:14.100 --> 06:16.200
This is our night, Johnny.

06:16.200 --> 06:18.300
This is our night. I can feel it.

06:18.300 --> 06:22.300
I mean, you've got them animals in there
eating out of the palm of your hand.

06:22.200 --> 06:26.700
You beat them, you take their money,
you call them names to their faces...

06:26.600 --> 06:28.200
and they love you.

06:28.200 --> 06:30.000
I don't know how you do it.

06:30.500 --> 06:32.300
I never saw anything like it.

06:32.300 --> 06:36.100
Beating a man out of his money, that's easy.
Anybody can do that.

06:36.800 --> 06:39.700
But beating a man out of his money
and making him like it...

06:39.700 --> 06:41.200
that's an art.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.900
That's an art of a true hustler.

06:44.900 --> 06:47.100
But it's getting late...

06:47.700 --> 06:50.800
and I don't wanna be here
all fucking night, okay?

06:51.100 --> 06:53.000
There's enough drug money in there...

06:53.000 --> 06:56.700
that we're gonna need
a fucking wheelbarrow to carry it out.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.700
So stop messing around.

07:01.300 --> 07:03.900
I mean, you got a game
those people never seen.

07:04.600 --> 07:08.100
And quite frankly,
I'd like to see it sometime myself tonight.

07:09.200 --> 07:12.800
You're gonna go in there,
you're gonna bump up the bet...

07:13.100 --> 07:15.900
and you're gonna
close this fucking night out.

07:16.400 --> 07:18.700
So stop wasting my fucking time.

07:20.700 --> 07:22.000
Just do it.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.200
A bottle of Jack.

07:31.300 --> 07:35.600
I'll be a three-legged dog
if I'm not looking at the Side Pocket Kid.

07:35.700 --> 07:36.900
You don't remember me...

07:36.800 --> 07:39.800
but I saw you play once
about 10 or 15 years ago.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.600
I used to wear a rug.

07:43.800 --> 07:45.000
Toupee Jay.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.600
Yeah, that's me.

07:46.900 --> 07:50.500
I saw this kid play one of the best games
I've ever seen in my life.

07:50.400 --> 07:52.900
Couldn't have been more than
14 or 15 years old...

07:52.900 --> 07:55.700
but, man, he could shoot the lights out!

07:55.700 --> 07:58.000
Now look at him. He's all grown up.

07:59.700 --> 08:02.300
You know, I always wondered
what happened to you.

08:02.300 --> 08:04.600
Why you never made it down
to Johnson City.

08:04.600 --> 08:07.800
Well, Jay, I've never been
much of a tournament player.

08:07.600 --> 08:10.000
-There's no money in them.
-No money?

08:10.600 --> 08:14.400
We just held the U.S. Open in Atlanta.
First prize was $100,000.

08:16.700 --> 08:19.800
But you gotta be invited to those things,
don't you?

08:19.800 --> 08:24.200
We did invite you. A couple of times.
I sent the invitations out myself.

08:25.700 --> 08:29.300
I even called and spoke to a backer
you had in those days.

08:29.400 --> 08:32.500
But he said you weren't interested.
Something about...

08:32.799 --> 08:35.799
your parents wanting you to finish school.

08:36.299 --> 08:39.600
What was the name
of that backer you had, anyway?

08:41.799 --> 08:43.100
Was it Joe?

08:46.100 --> 08:47.600
Bet $20,000!

08:49.500 --> 08:51.800
What's the matter? Did I stutter?

08:52.000 --> 08:54.200
Everybody got all quiet, and shit?

08:54.200 --> 08:57.300
About a minute ago,
it was like an evening at the Apollo.

08:57.300 --> 09:00.200
Now, all of a sudden, it's quiet as a church.

09:01.400 --> 09:03.800
That's all right, Chico, I don't blame you.

09:04.100 --> 09:08.300
I've been beating this motherfucker
all goddamn night. He can't win.

09:08.500 --> 09:10.500
You better watch your mouth.

09:10.500 --> 09:12.400
You watch my mouth, Chico...

09:12.400 --> 09:15.300
'cause you sure as hell
don't want to watch me play pool.

09:15.100 --> 09:18.500
Unless I'm blindfolded, handcuffed,
with a cue sticking out of my ass.

09:18.500 --> 09:21.000
Maybe you'd bet the $20,000 then, right?

09:22.700 --> 09:24.600
That's what I thought.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.800
Come on, Joe, let's get the fuck out of here.

09:28.900 --> 09:31.700
These guys wouldn't bet $5 they were black.

09:32.100 --> 09:33.400
Hold this.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.200
You got a bet.

09:36.600 --> 09:40.600
But for $20,000, you got to play
my man Brad in the corner, over there.

09:44.200 --> 09:46.400
What are you doing?
I only got $8,000 on me.

09:46.400 --> 09:50.500
Don't play that guy. He's a pro.
I saw him at the pro tournament in Phoenix.

09:50.400 --> 09:52.900
Don't you ever tell me who I play again.

09:54.300 --> 09:57.400
I'll play anybody in the house,
you know that, Chico.

09:59.200 --> 10:02.000
Do you wanna play this bad motherfucker
on my money?

10:01.900 --> 10:03.500
I don't think so.

10:03.600 --> 10:05.800
Seems you got
too much personal shit going on.

10:05.800 --> 10:09.300
You know what? Fuck you, Johnny.
Charles, get the rack.

10:09.400 --> 10:10.700
I'll play him myself.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.800
-What the fuck are you doing?
-He's got $8,000 on him, but it's not enough.

10:51.700 --> 10:53.600
What the fuck is going on?

10:53.600 --> 10:56.100
You should have looked out for me.
I was just a kid.

10:56.100 --> 10:58.700
I'll fucking kill you, you motherfucker!

10:58.700 --> 11:00.200
Shut the fuck up!

11:00.600 --> 11:05.000
Do you honestly think that I would let
a white boy walk into my pool hall...

11:04.800 --> 11:08.000
and talk that much shit
unless he was trying to tell me something?

11:07.900 --> 11:10.200
You missed the fucking signs.

11:11.200 --> 11:12.800
You didn't listen.

11:12.800 --> 11:14.900
Me and Johnny, we's niggas.

11:16.800 --> 11:18.800
-I'm out of here.
-Peace.

11:19.200 --> 11:22.300
What's this I hear
about you not having my money?

11:25.300 --> 11:27.100
Get the fuck off me!

11:35.300 --> 11:37.300
When I was 12, I walked into a pool room...

11:37.300 --> 11:39.500
picked up a cue,
and I just knew how to play.

11:39.600 --> 11:42.400
I guess, for some people,
it's baseball or music.

11:42.200 --> 11:44.000
For me, it was pool.

11:44.100 --> 11:47.900
But I never wanted to be a hustler.
I wanted to be the best.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.900
But after 15 years with Joe...

11:50.800 --> 11:53.800
the only thing I ever got to be
was the best hustler.

11:53.700 --> 11:57.300
I guess, in life, things don't always work out
the way you want them to.

13:29.200 --> 13:30.700
You wanted to see me?

13:31.900 --> 13:35.900
I'd have to say you're the worst carpenter
I ever worked with in my entire life.

13:35.800 --> 13:37.300
How did you get this job?

13:37.300 --> 13:39.200
Jack Radosta hired me on.

13:40.200 --> 13:42.800
I guess he thought
he owed me a couple of favors.

13:42.800 --> 13:46.900
Jack's a good man.
Bad gambler, but he's a good man.

13:47.100 --> 13:49.400
I know I'm no good at any of this stuff.

13:49.300 --> 13:52.200
But Jack's been showing me some things.
If I work harder...

13:52.200 --> 13:55.600
-and I try as hard as I can--
-Relax, you're not getting fired.

13:56.500 --> 13:58.900
As a matter of fact,
I've decided to move you up...

13:58.900 --> 14:01.400
and make you head of supplies.

14:01.300 --> 14:03.300
That's a promotion, son.

14:03.600 --> 14:06.800
-More money, nice bonuses.
-Thanks.

14:07.500 --> 14:11.800
I figure, out of all the men here,
you're probably most qualified for that job.

14:11.700 --> 14:13.100
Why do you say that?

14:13.100 --> 14:15.400
You're the pool hustler, ain't you?

14:15.400 --> 14:18.500
If I need a few truckloads of steel
to disappear off this site...

14:18.500 --> 14:21.500
I know I can count on you
to make it happen, right?

14:21.400 --> 14:25.700
You get taken care of, I get taken care of,
and everybody's happy.

14:26.200 --> 14:29.400
And the heaviest thing
you ever have to lift around here...

14:30.500 --> 14:32.000
is a clipboard.

14:35.700 --> 14:36.700
Well?

14:39.300 --> 14:42.300
I'm sorry, Bill.
I think you got the wrong guy.

14:42.200 --> 14:45.400
-What?
-Tell Jack I said thanks, okay?

14:45.500 --> 14:47.300
You don't do as I say...

14:47.300 --> 14:50.800
then you and Jack will both
be looking for work somewhere else.

14:50.700 --> 14:53.200
Then you can tell Jack I said we're even.

15:04.100 --> 15:06.300
Johnny, you got a phone call.

15:11.300 --> 15:13.100
Hey, Nick. What's up?

15:13.400 --> 15:14.500
What?

15:17.400 --> 15:18.600
Yeah, I want a game.

15:53.000 --> 15:57.000
What I'm saying is that I bet you $200
I can drink both these pints of beer...

15:56.900 --> 15:59.700
-before you drink those shots of Jack.
-Sounds good to me.

15:59.700 --> 16:01.200
That is absolutely impossible.

16:01.300 --> 16:03.700
-Then put up your money.
-No problem.

16:03.600 --> 16:07.200
-Brett, can you spot me?
-Again? You already owe me $200.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.200
I'll pay tomorrow.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.200
No cheating. I know how you guys are.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.700
You can't knock one of my glasses
off the table...

16:12.700 --> 16:14.700
and tell me to lap it up to win my bet.

16:14.700 --> 16:18.000
-Who the fuck do you think we are?
-I know, I just....

16:18.000 --> 16:21.000
To be fair, you must at least
let me finish my first beer...

16:21.000 --> 16:22.900
before you fire down both your shots.

16:22.900 --> 16:24.900
And we can't touch the other's glasses.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.000
-Deal.
-You're on.

16:26.100 --> 16:27.700
-Fine.
-Sounds good to me.

16:27.700 --> 16:29.300
Absolutely. Good luck.

16:29.300 --> 16:32.500
$20, $30, $40.... $65.
How much more do I need?

16:32.800 --> 16:35.200
If Tang wins his game,
that should be just enough.

16:35.200 --> 16:37.600
Since when was he satisfied
with just enough?

16:37.500 --> 16:39.700
Tang's right.
Plus I'll need more money for fliers.

16:39.700 --> 16:42.500
You can play Moose a quick game.
He's good for $100.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.800
-Say, Moose!
-Don't mess with me.

16:44.800 --> 16:46.800
I was watching TV with your wife today.

16:46.800 --> 16:49.900
Stupid bitch.
Took her two hours to watch 60 Minutes.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.300
Look, I'm sorry. I made him.... Oh, my God!

16:54.100 --> 16:56.100
-Say, "1, 2, 3, go."
-1, 2, 3, go.

16:59.200 --> 17:01.600
-That hand's quicker.
-What difference does--

17:01.600 --> 17:03.600
-Use your left hand--
-Shut up.

17:08.200 --> 17:11.300
You can't touch my glasses
and I can't touch yours.

17:11.599 --> 17:13.800
It's incredible what's going on.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.200
How about that?

17:19.599 --> 17:22.000
That's it, Danny, get your money up.

17:21.900 --> 17:25.099
Race to 5 for $100,
and I wanna see the money this time!

17:25.000 --> 17:26.700
No more playing for owesies.

17:26.599 --> 17:30.300
Good Lord, Moose!
Will you calm down, get a throat lozenge?

17:30.200 --> 17:33.000
Let me get my cue, will you? Hey, Nick!

17:33.600 --> 17:35.300
Hand me my cue, will you?

17:36.500 --> 17:39.000
-ls that legal?
-Of course it's not legal.

17:39.400 --> 17:41.100
I'll get your money.

17:42.900 --> 17:45.200
-What's he doing here?
-Never mind your brother.

17:45.200 --> 17:48.500
He's playing Moose, for Christ's sake.
Concentrate on your own game.

17:48.500 --> 17:52.000
-You've told me that since I was 15.
-I can't help it. This guy's tough.

17:51.900 --> 17:53.000
He's a pro.

17:55.700 --> 17:57.700
You didn't say anything about that.

17:57.800 --> 18:00.000
This guy's a pro? What's his name?

17:59.900 --> 18:04.100
I don't know. He's a new guy on the circuit,
for Christ's sake.

18:04.400 --> 18:08.600
-I don't know. I haven't played in a while.
-lf you're short on the money, I'll back you.

18:08.500 --> 18:12.000
-lt's not about the money--
-I know it is not about the money...

18:12.000 --> 18:14.900
but you can't go on playing bums
all your life.

18:14.800 --> 18:18.600
Sooner or later, if you're any kind of man,
you got to step up...

18:18.500 --> 18:22.000
step out, and see what the fuck you got.

18:25.300 --> 18:27.500
All right, somebody hand me a cue.

18:33.100 --> 18:37.100
-You wanna play some?
-Maybe something cheap. I'm just learning.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.200
-$1,000 sound about right?
-Fine.

18:41.700 --> 18:44.600
-Did you see that last shot?
-Unbelievable!

18:44.800 --> 18:47.900
-You see the look on that fucker's face?
-Fucking dog.

18:47.800 --> 18:49.600
We gotta go to Mel's.

18:49.500 --> 18:52.100
Waitress there has the sickest tits
I've ever seen.

18:52.100 --> 18:55.200
-Jesus Christ, when did this happen?
-Weather's been crazy lately.

18:55.200 --> 18:57.500
How often have I said,
"Stay out of the pool room"?

18:57.400 --> 19:00.500
-A thousand?
-Exactly. So how come you don't listen?

19:00.500 --> 19:03.700
It makes no sense. Every day
you say, "Stay out of the pool room."

19:03.600 --> 19:06.300
But I come and win $200 or $300.
It's easy money.

19:10.500 --> 19:11.700
-Enough!
-Coming to Mel's?

19:11.800 --> 19:13.700
You guys are retarded. I'm not going.

19:13.700 --> 19:15.800
-Let's go.
-Seriously, don't smoke.

19:15.800 --> 19:18.900
If I catch you with him smoking,
I'll take your bar mitzvah money.

19:18.900 --> 19:21.400
-Thanks, Mom.
-He wouldn't do that, would he?

19:21.400 --> 19:23.500
All right, Mom, get in the fucking car.

19:23.500 --> 19:27.600
Did you guys know
that the average penis size is 6.4 inches...

19:27.800 --> 19:31.400
and that the average vaginal canal
is 7.9 inches?

19:31.400 --> 19:33.900
Therefore, in this country alone...

19:33.900 --> 19:36.900
there's over 17,000 miles...

19:37.000 --> 19:39.700
of unused virgin pussy out there.

19:41.800 --> 19:44.700
-Come on.
-What the fuck is the matter with you?

19:44.700 --> 19:47.100
-This shit is true.
-Did you do the math on that?

19:47.100 --> 19:49.300
-I did.
-You have too much free time.

19:49.300 --> 19:51.100
Where do you get this shit?

19:51.000 --> 19:53.100
-lt's common knowledge.
-Hey, Danny.

19:54.200 --> 19:58.000
-You still playing The Goat, Friday night?
-Yes, you girls are coming, right?

19:57.900 --> 20:01.900
The guy who signed Stevie Ray Vaughan
is coming down to see my ass.

20:01.800 --> 20:05.500
Sorry, I gotta work Friday night,
and it's Lanie's last night of training.

20:05.300 --> 20:07.300
What is this, the Olympics?

20:07.500 --> 20:09.900
Come on, take the night off.
I'll train her myself.

20:09.900 --> 20:12.200
This is the universal sign for "check."

20:13.000 --> 20:14.100
I need this.

20:14.100 --> 20:18.200
If Sinatra made it big by paying off girls
to scream and faint when he sang...

20:18.200 --> 20:22.000
I got to have a couple of hot girls
throwing their panties on stage at my gig.

20:21.800 --> 20:24.000
-We'll see.
-I love you. Mean it.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.200
-Are you kidding me?
-Man, that chick has got body karate.

20:27.200 --> 20:30.200
Do you think her tits are real?
I hate chicks with fake tits.

20:30.100 --> 20:33.700
Are you kidding me? Fake tits are
the greatest invention of the 20th century.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.700
-Plus they're safer.
-Safer?

20:35.900 --> 20:38.800
Do you know that 78 percent
of chicks that have fake tits...

20:38.700 --> 20:41.400
who are involved in boating accidents
do not drown?

20:41.300 --> 20:43.900
-Where do you get this shit?
-lt's common knowledge.

20:43.800 --> 20:45.500
Get the fuck out of here.

20:56.200 --> 21:00.800
Now, slowly, give me your gun
and all the money in your briefcase, nigga.

21:01.700 --> 21:04.600
You messed
with the wrong guy, motherfucker.

21:04.900 --> 21:06.800
Payback's a bitch, ain't it?

21:11.000 --> 21:14.900
My girlfriend, Tara, was a law school
student from the good side of the tracks.

21:14.800 --> 21:19.100
Her parents had her living in this
fancy apartment for the last four years.

21:19.600 --> 21:21.800
She didn't like me playing pool much.

21:21.800 --> 21:24.300
And I didn't like me much when I didn't.

21:24.600 --> 21:28.400
Now that I've picked up the cue again,
I just hope she understands.

21:34.100 --> 21:35.500
Hi, baby.

21:37.400 --> 21:40.100
I'm sorry that I didn't call. I was....

21:50.300 --> 21:52.400
Fuck! Jesus fucking crap!

21:52.800 --> 21:54.500
Did you forget something?

21:54.500 --> 21:57.900
It's your boss's party tonight,
and I'm supposed to wear a suit, right?

21:57.800 --> 22:00.200
It was my birthday last night, Johnny.

22:01.300 --> 22:03.900
-lt was?
-God damn you.

22:08.800 --> 22:11.400
Why didn't you
say something about it last night?

22:11.400 --> 22:12.800
What's this?

22:14.100 --> 22:16.600
You're playing again, aren't you?

22:17.000 --> 22:20.800
So that's what's more important
than me last night, the fucking game?

22:20.800 --> 22:23.900
Aren't we through with all that?
What about your job with Jack?

22:23.900 --> 22:26.600
What about my job with Jack?
It didn't work out.

22:26.600 --> 22:27.600
Why?

22:28.800 --> 22:31.600
Do I look like a construction worker to you?

22:31.500 --> 22:35.200
Give me an Indian and a cop,
I'll sing you YMCA. Is that what you want?

22:35.100 --> 22:37.600
You think I like living with you,
like a kept man?

22:37.500 --> 22:40.000
Breaking my back for peanuts
while you pay the check?

22:40.000 --> 22:42.200
I play pool, Tara. That's what I do.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
You know I beat a pro last night?

22:44.900 --> 22:49.000
First time I picked up a cue in forever.
I sent him to the ATM three times.

22:49.200 --> 22:53.000
I've always done what other people
want me to do. You, Joe, everybody.

22:53.700 --> 22:58.200
-Now I'm gonna do what I wanna do.
-ls that why you play? Is it for the money?

22:59.900 --> 23:02.100
You know me better than that.

23:04.400 --> 23:06.200
I'm not sure how well I know you.

23:06.300 --> 23:09.100
But you'll start to get to know
my foot in your ass...

23:08.900 --> 23:11.600
if you think that
you're gonna forget my birthday...

23:11.500 --> 23:14.100
and make me feel sorry for you
in the morning.

23:14.100 --> 23:17.900
I just turned 30,
and I will be damned if I'm gonna let you....

23:18.600 --> 23:20.000
Oh, my God.

23:23.100 --> 23:24.500
You rat bastard!

23:26.800 --> 23:31.000
Mikey V, go get my stuff.
You hock that thing again?

23:30.900 --> 23:33.500
I just needed a little cash
for last night's game.

23:33.500 --> 23:37.300
-You pawn motorcycles?
-I pawn anything, you know that.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.400
That's your guitar. You shouldn't pawn that.

23:40.400 --> 23:43.200
He's got your pool cue.
You're not supposed to pawn that.

23:43.200 --> 23:44.400
That's different.

23:44.300 --> 23:46.300
-Why is that different?
-Because it is.

23:46.300 --> 23:49.300
If you need something, come to me.
Don't hock that thing again.

23:49.300 --> 23:51.700
That's not very practical.
You're never around.

23:51.700 --> 23:53.500
I'll be around.

23:53.500 --> 23:56.400
I'm playing at The Goat, Friday.
Think you can come?

23:56.300 --> 24:00.200
Why you gotta say it like such an asshole?
Just ask me nicely, and I'll be there.

24:00.100 --> 24:01.600
-What time?
-8:00.

24:01.600 --> 24:04.200
-I'll be there at 8:00, all right?
-We'll see.

24:07.700 --> 24:10.100
Looks like you're getting pretty good
at that thing.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.300
I'm getting pretty good at a lot of things.

24:12.200 --> 24:14.500
Watch yourself,
I'll be coming after you soon.

24:14.500 --> 24:16.300
I'll be sure to keep my eyes open.

24:16.400 --> 24:18.700
I made a score last night,
so just take some--

24:18.700 --> 24:22.000
What're you doing?
Are you gonna embarrass me in front of V?

24:21.800 --> 24:25.800
You're my brother, not my mother.
You start looking after yourself.

24:25.700 --> 24:27.400
You're in here, too.

24:28.500 --> 24:31.800
That's me. That's not supposed to be you,
all right?

24:31.900 --> 24:35.900
I leave town for five minutes, and this guy
thinks he's a hotshot pool shark.

24:35.800 --> 24:37.500
Yeah, well, I am.

24:37.800 --> 24:39.500
-You're not.
-I am.

24:43.700 --> 24:46.500
You should not be having
your hands like that.

24:46.500 --> 24:47.900
Why should I not have my hands up?

24:47.900 --> 24:49.900
Because someone could just,
I don't know....

24:49.800 --> 24:51.800
My goodness, is that horrible?

24:53.600 --> 24:54.800
You know something?

24:54.800 --> 24:57.600
You really wanna see pool,
come to the state line with me.

24:57.600 --> 24:58.600
Check out the pros.

25:08.300 --> 25:10.200
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen...

25:10.200 --> 25:13.700
and welcome to the Olhausen Invitational...

25:13.800 --> 25:16.700
$100, 000 9-ball shootout.

25:17.200 --> 25:19.900
I see a lot of familiar faces here tonight.

25:19.800 --> 25:22.800
May your hands be steady,
and your aim be true.

25:23.100 --> 25:24.300
Good luck.

25:26.300 --> 25:27.300
Look at this.

25:27.700 --> 25:29.700
See that guy in the beard?

25:29.900 --> 25:33.000
That's Robert Tobin.
Best bank shot in the game.

25:33.100 --> 25:35.200
Big guy over there with bushy eyebrows.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.200
That's Bruce Kaner, the champ from Russia.

25:37.200 --> 25:40.400
But the guy they always chase every year
for the title is that guy.

25:40.400 --> 25:42.900
-Bobby LeBlanc.
-The best in the game.

25:43.200 --> 25:45.500
Look at him, watch the way he breaks.

25:45.900 --> 25:46.900
Shit.

25:47.400 --> 25:50.300
Three balls on the break.
Six-ball run, and he's out.

25:50.400 --> 25:52.300
Is that what makes him so good?

25:52.200 --> 25:55.100
With that break,
he only plays six while others play nine.

25:55.100 --> 25:58.000
There's a lot more to his game
than his break.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.800
Watch the way he strokes the ball.

25:59.800 --> 26:01.700
Smooth, never out of line.

26:02.400 --> 26:06.000
When God invented pool players,
He made that guy right there.

26:06.200 --> 26:08.000
Hey, Johnny, is that you?

26:08.100 --> 26:10.900
St. Louis Louie, how you doing?
It's good to see you.

26:10.900 --> 26:14.300
You, too. What're you doing here?
I didn't see your name on the roster.

26:14.100 --> 26:15.400
I'm not playing.

26:15.500 --> 26:18.000
I'm just showing my brother
a real game of pool.

26:17.900 --> 26:21.100
-He's never seen you play before?
-Like I said, a real game.

26:20.900 --> 26:24.200
Don't let him fool you. Your brother
can move the rock with the best.

26:24.200 --> 26:25.700
I don't know about that.

26:25.600 --> 26:29.800
I'm gonna go up and say hello to the boys.
Y'all wanna come with me?

26:29.600 --> 26:31.100
Sure. Let's go.

26:31.200 --> 26:33.200
What's he mean by "the rock"?

26:33.200 --> 26:35.300
That's the cue ball. Come on.

26:37.700 --> 26:40.300
All right, fellas. Clear the way.
I'm coming through!

26:40.300 --> 26:43.800
Sorry, Louis, there's no food in here.
Buffet's around the corner.

26:44.100 --> 26:45.900
What're you laughing at, Shorty?

26:45.900 --> 26:50.500
When you go to bed at night, how do you
keep your head from sliding off the pillow?

26:50.400 --> 26:52.400
I want you to meet an old friend of mine.

26:52.300 --> 26:55.600
This is Johnny Doyle,
his big brother, Danny.

26:55.700 --> 26:58.300
Charlie Banks over here, Boston Shorty...

26:58.300 --> 27:00.800
and the legendary Jersey Red.

27:01.100 --> 27:04.100
Jersey Red? I've heard about you for years.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
-What have you heard?
-Red's got more stories than the Bible.

27:06.900 --> 27:09.500
I once heard you ran a rack of balls
with a nine iron.

27:09.500 --> 27:13.200
It was a putter, son.
Took the sorry son of a bitch for $12,000.

27:13.700 --> 27:15.900
-What was your last name?
-Doyle.

27:15.900 --> 27:18.700
Used to be known as "The Side Pocket Kid."

27:18.700 --> 27:22.200
I heard of you.
You're the kid who took Bucktooth's Chevy.

27:22.300 --> 27:23.400
You remember that?

27:23.400 --> 27:26.700
Remember it? That was my car.
Bucktooth stole it from me.

27:26.700 --> 27:29.700
It's not funny. We were on the road together.

27:29.800 --> 27:31.500
I pull off to take a piss.

27:31.500 --> 27:34.700
He drives off, leaves me standing there
with my dick in my hand.

27:34.900 --> 27:38.400
I loved that car. I was glad he lost it to you.
Let me buy you a drink.

27:38.200 --> 27:40.100
-You want one, Louie?
-Not really.

27:40.100 --> 27:42.600
I got a game, shortly, and I gotta stay sharp.

27:42.600 --> 27:44.700
-Who's it with?
-Greeks. You all want in?

27:44.700 --> 27:46.800
Greeks? Shit, yeah, count me in.

27:47.400 --> 27:49.800
Malaka, you're professional.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.900
Last time you play, you beat me $10,000.

27:52.900 --> 27:54.900
I shoot ball three times whole game.

27:54.900 --> 27:57.000
Yeah, but I had my eight hours of sleep.

27:56.900 --> 28:00.200
-You know I don't play good when I'm tired.
-What about your friend?

28:00.100 --> 28:02.500
We play partner. $2,000 a man.

28:02.700 --> 28:06.100
Who, him? I don't even know him.
He don't wanna play pool, anyway.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.300
Ask him.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Hey, kid, you wanna play some pool?

28:10.000 --> 28:11.500
Sure, I'll play.

28:11.500 --> 28:13.300
I'll see if he's got any money.

28:16.900 --> 28:18.900
You are so beautiful, man.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.900
You've got 'em so turned around,
they don't know what to think.

28:21.800 --> 28:24.600
Red, let me borrow your cue for a second.

28:27.400 --> 28:28.400
What?

28:28.700 --> 28:31.500
Johnny, I thought you knew
what we were trying to do here.

28:31.400 --> 28:33.700
I'm trying to set him up for Red.

28:34.200 --> 28:36.300
I thought you knew the move.

28:36.500 --> 28:38.400
No hard feelings, all right?

28:41.100 --> 28:42.600
Of course not.

28:43.100 --> 28:45.000
Go ahead, go do your thing.

28:49.600 --> 28:50.700
What's this?

28:50.700 --> 28:54.000
He doesn't have any money,
but just to show you how fair I am...

28:54.000 --> 28:56.300
I'll take the old shaky man as my partner.

28:56.300 --> 28:59.000
Fine, you take old man. Let's go.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.300
Get balls!

29:00.400 --> 29:03.000
I got your balls right here,
you Greek bastard.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.100
You don't wanna play this guy, anyway.

29:05.100 --> 29:07.500
He may be a jackass,
but he plays pretty good.

29:07.400 --> 29:09.800
Here, hold my coat, will you? Thanks.

29:18.900 --> 29:22.200
Here, stick around.
Play some cards or something, all right?

29:22.200 --> 29:24.600
Take a cab home. I'm gonna get out of here.

29:25.000 --> 29:28.400
-I wanna go with you, man.
-Just do as I say, all right?

29:40.400 --> 29:42.200
I made a Freudian slip yesterday.

29:42.100 --> 29:44.700
I meant to ask my wife to pass the butter...

29:44.700 --> 29:48.200
but instead I said,
"You bitch! You've ruined my life!"

29:50.900 --> 29:53.800
-That's lovely. Excuse us.
-My pleasure.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.600
-You're late.
-You look fantastic.

30:27.900 --> 30:30.500
You're still late. What took you so long?

30:30.500 --> 30:33.400
You didn't tell me
the guy lived in Sherwood Forest.

30:33.400 --> 30:35.200
It took me an hour to find the place.

30:35.100 --> 30:38.900
I had to leave a trail of breadcrumbs
along the way, to find my way back.

30:38.900 --> 30:40.600
You don't look so bad yourself.

30:40.500 --> 30:43.200
-I can't believe I got you in a suit.
-Me, neither.

30:43.200 --> 30:45.000
It's going back tomorrow.

30:45.200 --> 30:47.900
I know how you hate these things.
Thank you for coming.

30:47.800 --> 30:49.200
No problem.

30:50.400 --> 30:52.300
Here comes the wicked witch of the world.

30:52.200 --> 30:54.000
-Brace yourself.
-Be nice.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.700
There you are. I want you
to meet some friends of mine.

30:56.700 --> 30:59.200
Tara, this is Bernice and Laurence Winthrop.

30:59.200 --> 31:02.800
Richard Illich, and this is Brian Schwartz.
Everyone, this is Tara.

31:02.800 --> 31:04.900
And John. Hi, John.

31:05.000 --> 31:08.800
I'm surprised to see you here,
what with your busy schedule and all.

31:08.700 --> 31:12.200
-I can't believe you actually made it.
-I did, Beth, all right? So relax.

31:12.200 --> 31:15.100
No, really.
What has been keeping you so busy?

31:15.200 --> 31:17.300
I know you're always fashionably late...

31:17.200 --> 31:21.100
but I would just love to know
what kept us all waiting for you today.

31:21.100 --> 31:23.500
I've been here for about an hour already.

31:23.400 --> 31:26.800
I just was outside,
helping the valets kick-start your broom.

31:26.700 --> 31:30.500
They had trouble finding your keys.
I think that was the problem.

31:30.500 --> 31:33.100
Beth, may I speak to you for a moment?

31:33.100 --> 31:36.200
John, I must say my curiosity is piqued.

31:36.500 --> 31:38.600
What kind of business are you in?

31:41.400 --> 31:44.900
-I kind of move money around.
-Money management. Hard currency?

31:44.900 --> 31:47.300
-Generally.
-lt's a risky business.

31:47.200 --> 31:49.000
What's your loss ratio?

31:49.300 --> 31:52.400
Larry, I don't lose money that often.

31:52.300 --> 31:54.300
Really? What's your technique?

31:54.900 --> 31:58.300
Let's just say I kind of
take it out of other people's pockets...

31:58.300 --> 32:01.100
and put it in my pocket,
you know what I'm saying?

32:05.000 --> 32:06.600
Okay, excuse me.

32:09.000 --> 32:13.200
Excuse me, handsome. You got anything
in this joint besides champagne?

32:13.700 --> 32:15.500
I didn't think so.

32:17.400 --> 32:20.400
Lawyers' party, big deal. Can't get a beer.

32:20.300 --> 32:22.600
I'm going outside. Get some smog.

32:25.200 --> 32:27.700
What do you call a thousand lawyers...

32:27.900 --> 32:30.300
buried up to their neck in sand?

32:31.600 --> 32:33.800
-What?
-Not enough sand.

32:33.900 --> 32:36.000
-Hi, Mike Flynn.
-John Doyle.

32:36.300 --> 32:38.000
I saw you come in.

32:38.200 --> 32:39.700
-Good hair.
-You, too.

32:40.200 --> 32:41.700
Are we related?

32:42.300 --> 32:43.600
Only kidding.

32:46.500 --> 32:48.400
I retired last month...

32:48.900 --> 32:52.600
so my friends drag me to these things.
They try to keep me busy.

32:53.000 --> 32:54.400
What do you do?

32:55.000 --> 32:57.400
I don't know.
You could say I'm self-employed.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.400
That's good. It's wise.

33:01.200 --> 33:03.400
When I was a kid, I figured out right away...

33:03.400 --> 33:06.500
most companies pay people enough,
so as they don't quit.

33:06.500 --> 33:09.600
People work hard enough,
so as they don't get fired.

33:09.500 --> 33:11.200
You know, what's that?

33:11.200 --> 33:13.000
Bullshit is what that is.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.400
You play pool, Mike?

33:17.400 --> 33:19.500
A little. Why do you ask?

33:21.000 --> 33:23.600
Because you got a crease on your pants.

33:25.400 --> 33:30.000
I'm not sure I wanna be hanging out with
a guy who noticed a crease in my pants.

33:29.900 --> 33:32.200
I didn't say "a crease in your pants."

33:32.100 --> 33:36.000
I said "a crease on your pants."
It's horizontal, below the pocket.

33:36.500 --> 33:40.100
Normally, I might think
that would come from bad dry-cleaning.

33:40.100 --> 33:43.500
But a guy like you
doesn't get bad dry-cleaning, do you?

33:45.000 --> 33:46.700
Comes from playing pool.

33:46.700 --> 33:49.900
When you lean against the table
to take a shot...

33:50.500 --> 33:54.200
table makes a slight crease in your pants.
Yours happens to be accentuated...

33:54.100 --> 33:57.900
by a little bit of blue chalk,
something only found on a pool table.

33:57.800 --> 34:00.500
You're right. I've been playing pool.

34:00.300 --> 34:04.200
Losing my ass all night
on that stupid table they got upstairs.

34:05.800 --> 34:08.199
You say they got a table upstairs?

34:10.100 --> 34:11.400
Come here.

34:20.500 --> 34:22.100
That's how we do it.

34:22.500 --> 34:24.600
It's no fair playing a guy on his own table.

34:24.500 --> 34:27.400
One more setup, Jack.
It's my party. You'll owe me.

34:27.300 --> 34:29.000
That's it for me.

34:28.900 --> 34:31.699
-Tapped out?
-Phil over here is a ringer.

34:32.100 --> 34:34.100
Mike, you back for some more?

34:34.100 --> 34:35.699
I'm just getting started.

34:35.699 --> 34:38.500
Phil, that's a friend of mine, John Doyle.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.900
Phil Stein. It's his house.

34:40.900 --> 34:43.500
John, nice to see you. You shoot pool?

34:44.300 --> 34:45.400
I play a little.

34:45.400 --> 34:48.500
We've been playing a little. Doubles, 8-ball.

34:48.500 --> 34:51.400
But everybody here seems to be tapped out.

34:51.300 --> 34:53.900
-You and Mike wanna take him on?
-Sure.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Why not double the stakes?

34:56.300 --> 34:59.800
Are you sure you could afford it?
You're down quite a bit right now.

34:59.700 --> 35:01.600
I'd be careful if I were you.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.800
I don't have a lot of money on me tonight.

35:03.800 --> 35:05.700
It's okay, I'll cover us both.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.200
Let's play, like children.

36:15.000 --> 36:18.400
This one's for all the marbles, boys.

36:20.500 --> 36:22.300
Maybe, if I just....

36:26.400 --> 36:30.600
I guess even a blind squirrel can find a nut
every once in a while.

36:30.700 --> 36:32.600
What are you trying to say, Phil?

36:32.500 --> 36:34.200
I'm not trying to say anything.

36:34.300 --> 36:36.500
I'm just saying that shot was luck.

36:36.500 --> 36:38.800
You couldn't do that again
in a million years.

36:38.700 --> 36:42.100
I don't have to make it again
in a million years. I made it just now.

36:41.900 --> 36:43.600
I'm saying it was luck.

36:43.700 --> 36:45.900
Nobody can make that shot. It's impossible.

36:45.900 --> 36:47.000
I can.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.300
What's that?

36:49.400 --> 36:51.000
Set 'em up, I'll make it.

36:52.900 --> 36:54.800
I'll even make it one-handed.

36:58.200 --> 36:59.600
Did I stutter?

37:00.500 --> 37:03.000
Everybody got all quiet, and shit.

37:03.200 --> 37:07.100
About a minute ago, it was like an Elk's
Lodge meeting up in this motherfucker.

37:07.100 --> 37:09.100
Now suddenly it's quiet as a church.

37:10.400 --> 37:12.000
Who is this guy?

37:13.700 --> 37:17.300
-You're not serious, are you?
-Of course I am. What's it worth to you?

37:17.200 --> 37:21.300
You're down quite a bit right now, Phil.
I'd be careful if I were you.

37:25.200 --> 37:26.500
One hand?

37:28.300 --> 37:31.800
All right, I'll bet you anything you want.

37:33.400 --> 37:34.600
Anything?

37:36.600 --> 37:37.900
All right.

37:39.800 --> 37:42.200
You have a young paralegal
that works for you.

37:42.200 --> 37:43.800
She's about to take the bar.

37:43.900 --> 37:46.400
Even though I'm sure she's great
at what she does...

37:46.400 --> 37:48.600
I think she'll make an even better lawyer.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.900
I say this: If I make that shot...

37:51.100 --> 37:54.300
you gotta give her a job as a lawyer
in your firm.

37:54.300 --> 37:57.000
One year. No special treatment.

37:57.400 --> 38:01.000
-Just a job and a chance to prove herself.
-That's ridiculous.

38:01.200 --> 38:03.900
We scout the top law school graduates...

38:03.900 --> 38:06.200
from all over the country for that job.

38:06.200 --> 38:09.200
It starts at six figures, plus benefits.

38:09.600 --> 38:12.700
Tell me, what the hell
are you gonna put up against that...

38:12.600 --> 38:13.900
if you miss?

38:19.200 --> 38:20.500
How about...

38:21.600 --> 38:23.000
my new Benz?

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
It's got a can't-get-lost system. It's beautiful.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.500
I know you want it.

38:32.300 --> 38:33.800
You can own it.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.800
All right. You got balls, kid.

38:38.300 --> 38:39.500
Set it up.

38:45.100 --> 38:46.100
Thanks.

39:06.300 --> 39:07.700
So what do you say?

39:07.700 --> 39:11.000
Come back to my boat, a little wine,
a little dancing.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.100
You should see the moon over the water.

39:13.100 --> 39:15.400
-lt's intoxicating.
-Will your wife be there?

39:15.300 --> 39:17.800
Honey, you'll never believe
what just happened.

39:17.800 --> 39:20.200
Excuse me.
Can't you see I'm talking to the lady?

39:20.200 --> 39:22.000
Now you're not. So beat it.

39:21.900 --> 39:24.800
Where've you been?
I've been looking for you all night.

39:24.800 --> 39:27.600
Upstairs. I've got an unbelievable story
to tell you.

39:27.500 --> 39:29.900
Can't you see
she doesn't want to talk to you?

39:29.900 --> 39:31.400
Come on, Tara. Let's go.

39:31.400 --> 39:34.500
-I'm not going anywhere with you.
-Who the fuck is this?

39:34.400 --> 39:38.300
-He's a lawyer in our firm. He's a little drunk.
-I don't care who he is.

39:38.300 --> 39:41.900
You talk to my girl again like that,
I'll take your teeth out with pliers.

39:41.800 --> 39:44.300
Don't talk to him like that.
You'll get me fired.

39:44.300 --> 39:47.500
-I can talk to him any kind of way I want.
-Good playing.

39:47.500 --> 39:50.500
You had Phil shaking
like a dog shitting peach seeds.

39:50.500 --> 39:53.300
Here's your end. And here's my card.

39:53.200 --> 39:56.300
You come across action like that again,
count me in.

39:56.700 --> 39:58.000
You know him?

39:58.200 --> 39:59.300
You know him?

39:59.400 --> 40:01.100
You hustled my boss?

40:02.300 --> 40:05.400
Of course you did.
Why should tonight be any different?

40:05.300 --> 40:08.600
You can't do anything
without playing an angle, can you?

40:08.600 --> 40:11.500
I'm sorry, Uncle Mike.
I shouldn't have brought him here.

40:11.400 --> 40:14.000
-That's your Johnny.
-This is Uncle Mike?

40:14.100 --> 40:16.900
-You don't understand, sweetheart--
-I understand.

40:16.800 --> 40:18.300
You think about one thing.

40:18.400 --> 40:20.700
You care about one thing, and it is not me.

40:20.600 --> 40:23.300
Please don't go. Get the fuck off me!

40:24.600 --> 40:25.600
Are you crazy?

40:25.700 --> 40:28.600
Women. You can't even
live with them anymore.

40:29.600 --> 40:31.300
So, what about you?

40:32.300 --> 40:35.600
I'll give you the keys,
and you can stay overnight at the office.

40:35.500 --> 40:36.900
Thanks, Nick.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.900
What are you going to do?

40:39.900 --> 40:42.800
Gonna give up pool
and try to go back to her?

40:42.800 --> 40:44.300
I gotta tell you something.

40:44.400 --> 40:48.200
I don't think you can give up the game,
because you love it too much.

40:48.100 --> 40:50.100
I don't know. Joe messed me up good.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.100
Joe had nothing to do with it,
for Christ's sake!

40:54.400 --> 40:58.400
Your trouble is, you played so many bums,
you almost became a bum yourself.

40:59.700 --> 41:01.000
And you're not!

41:01.100 --> 41:05.500
You're suffering from
a minor-league syndrome, understand?

41:05.400 --> 41:07.900
You've gotta pull your ass out of that.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.500
Tang and Danny don't belong in this place.

41:10.500 --> 41:14.500
They don't belong in the world of pool.
But you do, for Christ's sake!

41:14.700 --> 41:18.800
You have one of the most natural talents
in that arm I've ever seen in my life.

41:18.700 --> 41:19.800
And what do you do?

41:19.800 --> 41:23.000
You walk around pretending,
"I don't deserve it."

41:23.900 --> 41:27.100
But you do deserve it,
don't you understand that?

41:27.500 --> 41:29.000
That's a waste!

41:29.400 --> 41:31.800
It's one of the biggest wastes in the world...

41:31.800 --> 41:35.200
because you have the ability to be the best!

41:37.500 --> 41:39.000
You come here.

41:40.800 --> 41:42.400
You go around...

41:43.200 --> 41:45.100
thinking you're a loser...

41:45.500 --> 41:48.200
and, boy, you'll become a loser.

41:49.300 --> 41:51.000
And pretty soon...

41:51.200 --> 41:54.300
the only people you'll be able to beat...

41:54.300 --> 41:59.300
are those people who think
they're bigger losers than you are.

42:01.800 --> 42:03.300
Think it over.

42:18.800 --> 42:20.700
Don't you fucking move!

42:24.300 --> 42:26.900
You're gonna shoot me, Joe? Go ahead.

42:27.800 --> 42:29.300
You killed me a long time ago.

42:29.300 --> 42:32.900
You ungrateful fucking prick.
You don't remember, do you?

42:33.300 --> 42:35.200
Where would you be without me?

42:35.200 --> 42:38.800
I found you on the street,
living above the arcade with the rats.

42:38.800 --> 42:41.600
Your mother and father
didn't care about you.

42:41.500 --> 42:43.800
But I did. I was your father.

42:44.300 --> 42:47.500
I bought you shoes and clothes.
I cleaned you up.

42:48.500 --> 42:50.300
I taught you a skill.

42:50.600 --> 42:52.300
I taught you the game.

42:52.400 --> 42:54.500
The car you drive, the women you're with...

42:54.500 --> 42:57.900
-everything you are, you are because of me.
-And what's that, Joe?

42:57.800 --> 43:00.300
A fucking con man, a liar?

43:01.800 --> 43:04.400
Someone who knows how to fuck you
before you fuck me?

43:04.400 --> 43:05.900
I don't want to be that anymore.

43:05.800 --> 43:08.700
-You owe me!
-I don't owe you fucking shit!

43:09.500 --> 43:13.700
Don't tell me how you did it for me,
because you did it for yourself.

43:14.100 --> 43:18.100
You saw a meal ticket in me,
and you fucking cashed it.

43:19.100 --> 43:21.400
But you sold me out cheap, man.

43:21.700 --> 43:23.600
You never gave me a chance.

43:24.000 --> 43:27.900
What, you think I'd get too big for you?
Like I wouldn't need you anymore?

43:27.900 --> 43:30.700
I needed you, Joe. I needed you a lot.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.900
Because, you know, you're right.

43:33.800 --> 43:35.900
My father never gave a fuck about me.

43:35.900 --> 43:37.900
I needed you to be my father.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.800
You don't like the way that tastes,
go ahead and shoot me.

43:41.800 --> 43:44.000
You're a tough guy. You can do it.

43:50.900 --> 43:53.000
You were never good enough to be a pro.

43:52.900 --> 43:54.900
At 14, they would've chewed you up.

43:54.900 --> 43:57.200
You should thank me. I saved you.

44:04.900 --> 44:07.300
-Maybe he's gay.
-I think he might be.

44:07.300 --> 44:10.400
-Are you gay? That's cool.
-I am not gay!

44:12.000 --> 44:13.500
A little loud.

44:15.200 --> 44:17.600
I think girls are a little weird, that's all.

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
This weekend, I was at this chick's house,
28 years old...

44:21.000 --> 44:23.500
and she still has stuffed animals on her bed.

44:23.400 --> 44:26.500
-Don't you find that strange?
-All chicks have stuffed animals.

44:26.300 --> 44:29.300
They're chicks, they're weird.
You can't let that bother you.

44:29.300 --> 44:31.300
-Scoot over.
-Dude, what happened?

44:31.300 --> 44:34.000
What the fuck did you do
to your fucking hand?

44:34.800 --> 44:37.400
I was drunk.
I slammed it in the door of my car.

44:37.400 --> 44:40.700
-You gotta go see a doctor.
-I'll go. It's all right.

44:40.600 --> 44:42.400
-You want me to take you?
-I'm good.

44:42.500 --> 44:45.800
-I came here to talk to Max, actually.
-What's up?

44:45.700 --> 44:47.900
I figured with my hand broke up like this...

44:47.900 --> 44:50.800
I should get a job,
'cause I won't be shooting pool no more.

44:50.800 --> 44:52.600
-You are drunk.
-How can I help?

44:52.600 --> 44:56.500
I figured since you're the only degenerate
here who's got a job...

44:56.500 --> 44:59.800
maybe I might ask that you put in a word
with that Merv guy.

44:59.800 --> 45:01.900
Merv? You fucking kidding me?

45:01.900 --> 45:04.100
He's not the kind you'd want to work for.

45:04.000 --> 45:07.100
-Why?
-He's kind of a fucking asshole.

45:07.700 --> 45:09.700
So, how bad could it be?

45:10.500 --> 45:12.400
Come on, he's a good friend of mine.

45:12.400 --> 45:15.800
Then definitely no. You think I want
anyone else like you working here?

45:15.600 --> 45:17.700
Next thing, it'll be mutiny at Merv's.

45:17.700 --> 45:21.100
Then they'll find me face down
in a puddle of blue toilet water.

45:21.100 --> 45:24.100
Don't you want a good salesman?
The sign in your office--

45:24.000 --> 45:25.600
I know what the sign says.

45:26.400 --> 45:29.000
Did you ever sell motor homes before?

45:29.200 --> 45:31.400
Did you ever sell cars before?

45:31.600 --> 45:34.100
Have you ever sold anything before?

45:34.500 --> 45:36.500
Then why the hell should I hire you?

45:36.500 --> 45:38.100
-Because I got ESPN.
-ESP.

45:38.400 --> 45:40.500
What the hell are you two talking about?

45:40.500 --> 45:43.400
You know, Dionne Warwick,
Psychic Friends, all that.

45:43.300 --> 45:45.400
It'll be a great asset for a salesman...

45:45.400 --> 45:47.800
to know what a customer's thinking
at all times.

45:47.800 --> 45:49.900
-I don't believe in that shit.
-You don't?

45:49.800 --> 45:53.000
-I don't.
-Then let me prove it to you.

45:52.900 --> 45:56.000
-How?
-I don't know. Let's make a bet.

45:56.200 --> 45:59.100
-What kind of bet?
-Don't. Remember what happened last time?

45:59.700 --> 46:01.700
What happened the last time?

46:01.700 --> 46:04.000
Nothing. Forget it. We'll go somewhere else.

46:05.100 --> 46:08.500
I'm tired of people not believing
in my psychic abilities here.

46:08.500 --> 46:10.200
I'll tell you what.

46:10.200 --> 46:13.900
If I can tell you where you got your shoes,
you give me a job, all right?

46:13.800 --> 46:17.000
If not, I don't know, you can have my ring.

46:17.200 --> 46:20.000
-He never gets the first one right.
-Will you shut up?

46:20.000 --> 46:22.200
Fine, you got yourself a bet.

46:22.100 --> 46:24.900
Sounds good to me.
Why don't you guys shake on it?

46:25.700 --> 46:28.600
But you'll never get that job,
I'll tell you why.

46:28.500 --> 46:32.200
I got these shoes when I was on a cruise,
in international waters.

46:32.100 --> 46:35.100
So no matter what you say,
you're gonna lose.

46:35.800 --> 46:38.800
I never said I could tell you
where you bought your shoes.

46:38.700 --> 46:43.600
I said I can tell you where you got 'em.
Right now, you got your shoes on your feet.

46:45.100 --> 46:49.500
-I hate it when that happens.
-How's today for you? Can you start today?

46:51.100 --> 46:53.000
Hi, this is Tara. Leave a message.

46:54.300 --> 46:56.500
Pick up the phone, will you, please?

46:56.900 --> 47:01.000
Sweetheart, please pick up the phone.
I'm tired of leaving messages.

47:02.400 --> 47:03.800
Hello ?

47:08.000 --> 47:10.700
I'll just leave you ridiculous shit
on your machine...

47:10.700 --> 47:12.800
until you run out of tape, okay ?

47:13.800 --> 47:15.800
Pick up the phone. Hello?

47:16.900 --> 47:18.800
All right, what do you want?

47:19.500 --> 47:20.600
Who is this? Beth?

47:22.700 --> 47:25.600
-I wanna speak to Tara.
-Tara doesn't want to speak to you.

47:25.500 --> 47:27.800
Put her on the phone for me,
will you, please?

47:27.800 --> 47:30.700
It's important. I need to speak with her.
God damn it.

47:30.700 --> 47:34.100
-Don't take that tone with me.
-There's something I have to say to her.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.800
-lt's very important.
-Tell me. I'll give her the message.

47:37.500 --> 47:40.400
-Bye.
-No, wait. Hold on.

47:43.500 --> 47:45.400
Can you take a message for me?

47:45.800 --> 47:47.300
Okay, great.

47:47.400 --> 47:50.100
Get a pen and paper.
Do you have one handy?

47:50.200 --> 47:52.900
-Right here.
-You have it in your hand?

47:53.000 --> 47:54.600
Write this down for me, please.

47:56.400 --> 47:58.500
-We gotta follow our dreams, right?
-Right.

47:58.400 --> 48:00.500
We live for the moment, right?

48:00.500 --> 48:05.200
Love what you do while you're alive, 'cause
tomorrow a truck could hit you, right?

48:05.800 --> 48:10.200
So I'm doing the right thing by taking
all the money my family's ever saved...

48:10.100 --> 48:14.600
for me to go to college with, and use it
to bankroll myself on the road, right?

48:14.700 --> 48:16.700
-You're not serious.
-He's serious.

48:16.700 --> 48:19.600
I can't believe I'm hearing this.
Please do something.

48:19.500 --> 48:21.900
I've talked to him all day,
but he won't listen.

48:21.900 --> 48:25.700
In that case, if he's got his mind made up,
there's no talking him out of it...

48:25.600 --> 48:28.400
the only thing left to do
is to send him out in style.

48:28.400 --> 48:32.000
Party, Chris's house, tomorrow night.
His parents are out of town.

48:32.800 --> 48:35.100
Robin Hood,
thank you for donating my place.

48:35.100 --> 48:37.600
Sorry, my parents just got
brand-new white carpeting.

48:37.600 --> 48:39.700
Anything gets on that, and I am a dead man.

48:39.700 --> 48:44.200
There is no way we could possibly have
a party at my house.

48:51.300 --> 48:54.600
Could everyone please stand on the plastic?

48:54.700 --> 48:57.300
What's going on? How are you doing?

48:57.300 --> 48:58.600
What's going on?

48:58.700 --> 49:00.100
Can I get you guys a beer?

49:00.000 --> 49:01.000
How you doing?

49:01.100 --> 49:02.100
What's up, doc?

49:03.200 --> 49:06.900
Listen, man, the key to picking up women
is very simple.

49:07.100 --> 49:10.000
Old Spice and Aqua Velva.

49:10.200 --> 49:12.900
Are you kidding?
That's the shit my dad uses.

49:12.800 --> 49:16.300
Exactly. That's what I'm trying to tell you.
This is the old-school shit.

49:16.200 --> 49:18.400
What the fuck are you looking at?

49:19.700 --> 49:20.700
It's cool.

49:21.000 --> 49:24.100
It just seems like
everybody I meet nowadays is just...

49:24.700 --> 49:26.100
weird.

49:26.400 --> 49:27.900
What's up, my man?

49:27.900 --> 49:32.400
I find myself wanting to meet a girl
who is completely normal, for a change.

49:32.300 --> 49:34.400
You don't have any tattoos, do you?

49:34.900 --> 49:35.800
Good.

49:35.900 --> 49:38.900
Sweetheart, come on, Jacuzzi. You'll love it.

49:39.500 --> 49:42.100
-What are you doing?
-Eating pop rocks, drinking pop.

49:42.100 --> 49:45.100
Are you out of your fucking mind?
What's the matter with you?

49:45.100 --> 49:46.700
Don't you know a kid died like that?

49:47.500 --> 49:50.200
-Wait a minute.
-What?

49:51.900 --> 49:54.300
Do you have any stuffed animals
on your bed?

49:54.300 --> 49:55.900
No, of course not.

49:58.600 --> 50:00.200
Okay, that's good.

50:05.800 --> 50:07.800
What are you doing?

50:08.200 --> 50:09.500
Choke me.

50:10.900 --> 50:13.600
-What?
-Choke me. I like it.

50:15.300 --> 50:16.500
Oh, my God!

50:20.800 --> 50:22.700
That's just.... Jesus!

50:24.900 --> 50:26.900
Yo, Romeo. Grab a brew and relax.

50:27.400 --> 50:30.500
-That's easy for you to say. Jesus!
-Where's Tang?

50:30.500 --> 50:34.200
Last time I saw him, I think
he was adopted by a 12-year-old boy.

50:34.000 --> 50:36.900
Seriously, I can't believe
he's really going on the road.

50:37.100 --> 50:40.100
Me, neither.
He has no idea what the fuck he's in for.

50:40.000 --> 50:41.800
I think that's kind of the point.

50:41.900 --> 50:44.400
But he doesn't realize
the situation that he's in.

50:44.600 --> 50:48.100
It's not about the money.
He's gambling with his future.

50:48.000 --> 50:51.500
If he fucks this up, then he can regret it
for the rest of his life.

50:51.500 --> 50:54.300
-What's he got in the box, anyway?
-$40,000.

50:54.200 --> 50:56.400
What? $40,000?

50:57.600 --> 51:00.000
And you morons
didn't try to talk him out of it?

50:59.900 --> 51:01.800
-What's wrong with you?
-I tried.

51:01.800 --> 51:04.300
He's so jonesed about this,
he doesn't listen to us.

51:04.300 --> 51:06.600
He's just trying to be like you.

51:10.500 --> 51:12.600
-All right, guys.
-You get 'em, baby.

51:12.700 --> 51:13.900
You go get 'em, Tang.

51:13.900 --> 51:16.700
All right. It's me against the world, baby!

51:17.900 --> 51:20.800
-Yeah, baby.
-You go shoot some stick, now.

51:28.600 --> 51:30.900
-Think he'll last a month?
-I'll give you 3-to-1.

51:30.800 --> 51:32.400
-I'll take it.
-All right.

51:45.800 --> 51:48.800
-Who is next?
-That's what I'm talking about, baby.

51:50.200 --> 51:51.500
Okay, mister.

51:56.100 --> 51:58.400
I didn't even have any of it, you know.

52:00.400 --> 52:03.200
Bye-bye. Anybody else? I'm game.

52:03.200 --> 52:05.300
Anybody in here play for money?

52:06.200 --> 52:08.800
-What do you play for?
-What do you got?

52:09.400 --> 52:12.400
-I play $20 a game.
-How about we play $100?

52:12.800 --> 52:16.100
And I'll give you four balls off the table.
You play 8-ball?

52:16.100 --> 52:17.600
We usually play 9-ball.

52:17.700 --> 52:20.400
You give me four balls off the table,
you got a game.

52:20.400 --> 52:21.700
Put it up.

52:24.300 --> 52:26.600
-Call it.
-Heads.

52:37.900 --> 52:39.100
Take 'em down.

52:50.900 --> 52:53.500
-Do it again?
-Put it up.

52:56.700 --> 52:57.900
What's going on?

52:59.100 --> 53:02.200
This guy's giving Chris four balls
off the table for $100 a rack.

53:02.200 --> 53:05.300
Four balls off the table?
Since when does Chris play 8-ball?

53:05.200 --> 53:06.600
I don't know. Why?

53:06.600 --> 53:09.500
Four balls off the table's
the biggest hustle in the world.

53:09.500 --> 53:13.300
Chris is getting his balls out of the way,
so this fucker can shoot.

53:13.200 --> 53:15.100
That's game. Do it again?

53:16.300 --> 53:18.200
-One more time.
-What's up?

53:18.100 --> 53:21.600
-I'm about to beat this guy's ass.
-How much you down?

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
$200.

53:24.900 --> 53:27.600
We've played two games
and I haven't shot yet.

53:27.500 --> 53:29.800
As soon as he fucks up, I'll be on his ass.

53:29.800 --> 53:32.300
Have you forgotten?
I'm on in an hour. Let's go.

53:32.200 --> 53:35.500
-He's giving me four balls off the table!
-Let's go.

53:36.600 --> 53:39.800
He's hustling you.
This guy's a fucking hustler. Let's go.

53:42.100 --> 53:43.600
Take 'em down.

53:46.400 --> 53:48.300
All right, Max, let's go.

53:48.300 --> 53:51.800
We can't leave Chris here.
What if the fucker tries to start something?

53:51.600 --> 53:55.700
He'll learn his lesson. Let's go.
I'll see you later. Don't be late.

53:56.200 --> 53:57.800
I hate choosing.

53:58.600 --> 54:00.100
I'm such a bitch.

54:00.400 --> 54:01.700
Let's get to work!

54:13.900 --> 54:16.700
Poor little white trash

54:17.300 --> 54:19.800
Say you got some extra cash

54:19.900 --> 54:22.300
Why don't you come

54:22.800 --> 54:25.500
and blow it all on me ?

54:26.100 --> 54:29.000
I ain't nothing but a smart ass

54:29.400 --> 54:32.000
drinking from an empty glass

54:32.700 --> 54:35.700
I'm as crazy as a tree

54:38.600 --> 54:40.500
What's your hurry ?

54:44.100 --> 54:47.100
Don't you worry, baby

54:47.200 --> 54:49.000
Never shed a tear for me

54:50.100 --> 54:53.000
Don't you worry, baby

54:53.200 --> 54:55.200
I'm cold as a boy can be

54:56.400 --> 54:59.200
I ain't scared of a broken heart

54:59.300 --> 55:02.200
I get bored with the easy part

55:03.800 --> 55:07.300
Heaven knows I'm a redneck gigolo

55:19.600 --> 55:22.200
I think you and I

55:22.300 --> 55:25.000
should go down by the seaside

55:25.200 --> 55:28.900
Pick up all the dead things on the beach

55:31.600 --> 55:34.400
Ain't nothing but a washed-up world

55:34.300 --> 55:37.500
You ain't nothing but a stupid girl

55:37.800 --> 55:42.300
I think that's the way that life ought to be

55:44.000 --> 55:46.500
What's your hurry ?

55:49.400 --> 55:52.600
Don't you worry, baby

55:52.600 --> 55:55.100
Never shed a tear for me

55:55.300 --> 55:58.700
Don't you worry, baby

55:58.600 --> 56:01.000
I'm cold as a boy can be

56:01.800 --> 56:04.700
I ain't scared of a broken heart

56:04.700 --> 56:07.800
I get bored with the easy part

56:09.300 --> 56:12.700
Heaven knows I'm a redneck gigolo

56:17.300 --> 56:18.300
Come on!

56:25.600 --> 56:27.100
All right, man.

56:30.700 --> 56:33.200
Man, you were really good tonight.

56:34.500 --> 56:35.800
Thanks, Harold.

56:36.700 --> 56:39.000
Too bad no one will ever know.

56:46.000 --> 56:50.000
Thanks for coming. I appreciate that.
Don't tell me. You lost.

56:50.300 --> 56:53.100
-I know. I fucked up, okay?
-Yeah, you fucked up.

56:53.800 --> 56:56.600
-God damn it. How much did you lose?
-$2,000.

56:57.100 --> 56:59.900
-What the fuck are you doing here?
-I'm waiting for you.

56:59.900 --> 57:03.100
Now that Johnny's gone,
you're the top dog around here.

57:03.100 --> 57:05.100
Maybe you want to step up.

57:05.400 --> 57:08.800
You ain't welcome around here no more.
Nick says you're out.

57:08.700 --> 57:12.100
Tell him I'll burn this place to the ground
if he thinks I'm out.

57:12.100 --> 57:15.600
And tell Johnny, when he gets his hand
out of that cast I put him in...

57:15.500 --> 57:17.500
that I want his game, too.

57:17.500 --> 57:20.200
-You did that to his hand?
-What the fuck will you do?

57:20.300 --> 57:22.800
Fuck! It's fucking bullshit, man.

57:23.000 --> 57:26.100
We can't let them come into our pool room
and push us around.

57:26.300 --> 57:29.700
-We gotta do something.
-What? Joe's a fucking psycho. He'll kill us.

57:29.600 --> 57:31.700
We've gotta beat him at his own game.

57:31.700 --> 57:35.600
That sounds great, but Joe's got
this demon fucking pool fiend with him.

57:35.600 --> 57:38.800
-The guy never misses. He's unconscious.
-We'll get Johnny to play.

57:38.700 --> 57:43.200
Fuck that. Johnny's out of his mind.
He's got chick drama and a broken hand.

57:43.100 --> 57:45.900
Anybody's gonna step up, it's gonna be me.

57:46.200 --> 57:49.100
Are you deaf? Did you not hear me?
The guy never misses.

57:49.000 --> 57:51.600
-He just destroyed me.
-Chris, I destroy you.

57:51.600 --> 57:53.600
This is different. The guy's really good.

57:53.600 --> 57:57.000
I'll play him on table 4.
Nobody knows better how that table rolls.

57:56.800 --> 57:59.200
That's true.
Table 4 does roll pretty fucked up.

57:59.200 --> 58:02.200
You know why? I'm the one
who put the matchbox under the leg.

58:02.200 --> 58:05.000
-Motherfucker.
-Give me my $100 back.

58:05.000 --> 58:08.800
We're gonna have to pawn your car.
I need money to put pressure on them.

58:08.700 --> 58:11.300
Wait a minute. Pawn my car?

58:11.700 --> 58:14.700
-You're not gonna pawn my car.
-lt's just for one day.

58:14.700 --> 58:16.600
Are you out of your fucking mind?

58:16.600 --> 58:18.700
There's no way I'm gonna let you do this.

58:18.700 --> 58:23.000
In a million years,
you are never gonna pawn my car.

58:32.700 --> 58:36.500
Let's go, Phil. $500 a hole.
Let's get cracking.

58:36.500 --> 58:38.600
Hold your horses. I gotta call my wife...

58:38.600 --> 58:41.400
and tell her I'll be stuck in traffic
for at least a week.

58:41.300 --> 58:43.400
Mr. Stein, you forgot to sign these.

58:44.000 --> 58:45.300
Thank you.

58:47.600 --> 58:49.600
That's great. You know...

58:50.300 --> 58:53.300
I need to talk to the both of you.

58:54.600 --> 58:56.400
Remember that bet you made?

58:57.500 --> 59:00.300
This is the last time
I'm gonna call you, so....

59:01.400 --> 59:05.800
I don't know, if you change your mind,
or if you ever check your machine...

59:07.100 --> 59:10.400
then you'll know where to find me.
All right. Bye.

59:12.600 --> 59:14.600
I am not having a good day.

59:15.100 --> 59:17.100
Every day is a good day, kid.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
Just try missing one once.

59:21.000 --> 59:25.600
I gotta go get some felt for the tables.
I'll be gone a couple of hours.

59:25.500 --> 59:28.200
-Keep an eye on the castle.
-You got it.

59:31.000 --> 59:32.100
Here.

59:33.000 --> 59:34.700
Here's the keys.

59:37.300 --> 59:41.400
Make sure you lock up
before you leave, all right?

59:42.100 --> 59:43.700
Back off her.

59:44.700 --> 59:46.300
-Ma'am.
-Hey, Nick.

59:52.100 --> 59:53.800
What happened to your hand?

59:54.300 --> 59:56.000
I cut myself shaving.

01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:03.800
Why didn't you tell me
what you did for me that night?

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:07.100
Because you spend so much time
always thinking that I'm an asshole...

01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:10.400
that you never see
any of the good things that I do.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.600
All I wanted to do...

01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:16.800
was give you what I knew you wanted
more than anything in the world...

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:19.400
the only way I knew how.

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:25.500
The only thing I ever wanted was you.

01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:29.500
I love you.

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:33.000
Wait.

01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:37.600
-There's something I have to tell you.
-What?

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.300
I'm a motor-home salesman now.

01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:48.800
I know. I heard.

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:51.300
What do you mean?

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:54.500
I saw you in the window, with the tie.

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:55.800
Are you stalking me now?

01:00:55.900 --> 01:00:59.700
No. You almost made a sale.
I almost came....

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:01.700
Why are you gonna stalk me?

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:04.300
I just missed you, baby.

01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:06.900
I missed you, too.

01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:21.700
You guys want some action?

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:24.300
I'll be at Hard Times, table 4, tonight.

01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:26.700
Can't miss me.
I'll be the one whipping your ass.

01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:30.200
What's the weather like lately?
I haven't been outside.

01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:32.500
What you wanna do, Brad....
Is that your name?

01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:36.300
You wanna stroke it, not poke it.
Look how pretty that is.

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:39.800
I move 'em around pretty good, myself.

01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:42.600
This is too easy.

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:46.200
Can you get that money up there?
My arm is....

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:48.600
Thanks. Appreciate it.

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:53.000
-$500, baby. Easy as fucking pie.
-That's my boy!

01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:56.200
Where'd you get that stick?
Is that Johnny's cue?

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:59.400
-He ain't using it, so I borrowed it.
-Danny, be careful, man.

01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:03.100
Something strange is going on.
He's not playing you the way he played me.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Of course not.
I'm a lot better player than you are.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.500
Here he comes.

01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:10.000
-Nice table.
-You like that? Thanks.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Why don't we switch tables
and double the bet?

01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:16.500
No, I say we play on this table or I quit.
That's the deal.

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:19.000
You're such a punk.
Fine, let's double the bet.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.600
That sounds good.

01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:22.500
You weren't breast-fed, were you?

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:24.800
Rack 'em, Joe, my finger's so'.

01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:33.200
Dead rail. I can't believe that!

01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:34.800
Table 4, baby.

01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:47.100
This guy's got us playing
on this fucked-up table.

01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:48.700
What's your deal?

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:52.300
Are you gonna play,
or cry about it like a fucking baby?

01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:54.700
Bet $5,000.
He can't beat me three sets in a row.

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:56.200
Shut up. It ain't your money.

01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:59.300
It's half my money.
You want out, I'll play him on my own.

01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:02.300
You can't fire an air barrel.
How will you cover if you lose?

01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:04.500
I'm not gonna lose. I'm in this guy's head--

01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:08.600
-Don't be an idiot. We don't have the money.
-Get the fuck out of here.

01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:11.300
Fine. $5,000. You call it.

01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:13.000
-You call.
-Tails.

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:21.100
So you won a fucking break.
Big fucking deal.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.700
Pay up. $5,000.

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:27.100
-Where's the money?
-Tough guy!

01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:34.200
Get the fuck out of here,
you punk-ass bastards. Get out of here. Go!

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.200
Listen to me. The money. 24 hours.

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:42.700
-Or next time I come back angry.
-You son of a bitch!

01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:46.000
-That's enough!
-I'll tell you when it's enough.

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:53.500
-Fuck!
-Jesus Christ, what the hell are you?

01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:55.700
I'm a klutz.

01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:57.300
Fuck, Danny!

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:37.600
Freeze! Put your hands in the air!

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.200
Get them up in the air so we can see them!

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:42.200
Let's see them hands!

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:53.900
Hey, Nick. What's going on?

01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:00.200
What's wrong?

01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:04.100
-Danny's in jail.
-What happened?

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:08.100
He crapped out
firing an air barrel at Brad last night.

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:09.600
How much?

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:13.000
$5,000. He's stuck for half of it.

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:15.300
And it gets worse.

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:19.200
When Joe found out
that Danny couldn't cover...

01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:23.500
then he leaned on him pretty heavy,
beat the shit out of him...

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:27.400
put a gun to his head and said,
"You've got 24 hours to get the money."

01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:29.900
That's when Danny went crazy,
tried to knock over Sal's.

01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:32.200
-What?
-He's in County Jail.

01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:34.400
It's $25,000 bail.

01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:37.000
We got to get him out, right? Nick?

01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:40.400
I'm sorry, kid.
I just don't have that kind of money.

01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:42.200
All I got is my dad's plastic.

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:46.000
-I ain't got nothing.
-I can call my dad.

01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:49.500
No.

01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:51.400
What are you gonna do?

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:55.800
I'm gonna go get my brother. Come on.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.100
Hey, Nick. He's here.

01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:02.500
Detroit. You got action.

01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:12.600
Come here. Give me the fucking thing.

01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:27.700
Fuck.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Nick, anything on the bankroll?

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.200
Nothing. De nada.

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:42.300
The next level. Why don't you take over?

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:44.900
Come on, set 'em up.

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:29.800
-How's the arm?
-Horrible.

01:08:34.399 --> 01:08:36.399
-You ready?
-I'm ready.

01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:40.000
-Let's play the first set for $5,000.
-All right, fine.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.500
Fine. Call it.

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:47.300
The money first. Put it up.

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:49.899
What's wrong?
You don't think I'm good for it?

01:08:49.899 --> 01:08:51.399
Put the money on the lights.

01:08:51.399 --> 01:08:55.800
-I think you know me better than that.
-I know you too well, Johnny boy.

01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:58.399
I'm not gonna fall for any of your old tricks.

01:08:58.899 --> 01:09:00.000
The money.

01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:03.899
Fine. Just give me a second, all right?

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:11.700
-What the hell are we working with here?
-lt's about $5,500.

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:13.100
Christ!

01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:16.700
I got one barrel, no cue.
How the hell do I like it?

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:18.500
It's okay. We're covered.

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:22.300
-Jesus Christ, where'd you get that?
-I'm the rich kid, right?

01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:23.800
Don't worry about it.

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:27.700
-Are we playing here, or what?
-We're playing.

01:09:28.100 --> 01:09:30.800
Joe, how about we play this one
for $10,000?

01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:33.899
-Ten's my favorite number.
-Nice cue. You shooting with that?

01:09:33.899 --> 01:09:37.500
No, that's not his cue, smart ass.
He's shooting with this.

01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:10.400
Fuck.

01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:15.200
You wanted a pro, you got one.
He's ranked 13th in the country.

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:18.700
You don't stand a shot against him.
You had enough yet?

01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:21.200
Rack 'em.

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:24.800
Christ, Nick, the kid's good,
but he's not that good.

01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:26.300
You're just getting started.

01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:29.200
Yeah, but it's just cost us $10,000
to get me started.

01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:32.400
You listen to me. I know this type of guy
from my past experience.

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:34.900
This son of a bitch is not a stayer,
you understand?

01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:39.000
He'll crack sooner or later.
When he cracks, you'll win. Have faith.

01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:42.700
-"Have faith."
-Okay, you're covered.

01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:47.700
Covered? What the hell
kind of ATM you got?

01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:49.900
Thanks, Chris.

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:14.700
Fuck!

01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:20.000
This is so sad.

01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:26.400
Wait here. I'm not done yet.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.400
I know. I think he's getting warmed up now.
Just give us another $10,000. Maybe....

01:11:32.900 --> 01:11:34.600
You motherfucker!

01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:38.400
How could you do this?

01:11:38.900 --> 01:11:41.600
This is fucking Tang, man!

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.400
He don't got no fucking credit cards
and no Cadillac.

01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:49.400
You give me this rich-kid bullshit.
You got me in there pissing away his future.

01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:52.200
What the fuck are you doing?

01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:55.200
What am l, a baby?
Like I had no say in this?

01:11:55.300 --> 01:11:58.800
-My friend was in trouble. I came to help.
-What the fuck, man?

01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:02.800
He bails out Danny now
and pays off his debt, he's out $30,000.

01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:04.600
Then he's broke, too. What the fuck?

01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:07.100
All right, we just took a fucking chance.

01:12:07.100 --> 01:12:10.200
Come on. We never thought you'd lose.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Here, man. Take this.

01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:21.900
Keep your money.

01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:26.000
What are you gonna do?

01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:30.700
Come on. Just take the money! I'm sorry!

01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:35.000
All right, what do you say we bump the bet?
Play this one for $20,000.

01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:38.100
How much you got up there, John?

01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:40.800
You wouldn't be flashing me
no nigger roll, would you?

01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:43.400
'Cause that don't look like no $20,000.

01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:47.600
As long as we're doing this,
why not play for $50,000?

01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:50.800
I've been looking for him all day.
Are we too late?

01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:52.100
No, perfect.

01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:56.900
-Sorry I'm late, John. Hi, how you doing?
-Who are you?

01:12:57.100 --> 01:12:58.500
His backer.

01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:05.500
What do you say you match what I got,
and we play till somebody takes it all?

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:11.400
-$20,000 is okay.
-Are you sure?

01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:14.100
-Race to 5 for $20,000.
-Put it up.

01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:36.400
All right.

01:13:56.700 --> 01:13:59.000
At least you got Tang's money back.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Yeah, but my brother's still in jail.

01:14:04.500 --> 01:14:06.400
Come here. Get over here.

01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:13.400
-Put him the fuck out. Come on.
-I got him.

01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:37.500
-Bet $40,000.
-Fine. Good. Even better.

01:14:55.300 --> 01:14:56.900
Go ahead. Shoot 'em.

01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:08.100
Don't miss.

01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:14.000
Fuck this back-and-forth bullshit.
It's a big waste of time.

01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:16.500
You want to put it all up, Mr. Backer man?

01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:20.900
Come on. Last set. Shoot it all.
Race to 9 for $80,000.

01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:26.200
I'm betting this big-time action
brings out the dog in your boy, over there.

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:30.600
Did I just stutter or something?

01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:37.100
A few minutes ago, it was like a pool hall
in here. Now it's as quiet as a church.

01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:43.100
Is this your first time in a pool hall,
Mr. Backer man? Is that it?

01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:47.400
Your clothes getting a little mashed?
Let me tell you something.

01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:51.800
When you walk out of here,
your skin will smell of this place for a week.

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:56.100
Every time you put on that suit,
you will think of me taking your money.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:00.400
'Cause I'm the only one in this room
who knows how fast your boy can run.

01:16:00.300 --> 01:16:03.100
You want to know why? 'Cause I bred him.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.600
How the fuck does that make you feel...

01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:10.200
to be in that position,
with all your money on the table?

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
-How much you got, Joe?
-What?

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:15.500
Total. You put down $80,000
like it didn't matter.

01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:19.300
That's a lot of money for somebody
like you and him. I think it matters.

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:22.200
-What's the difference--
-I'm a millionaire.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:26.800
That's the difference.
I lose $80,000, I get another $80,000.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:30.200
For me, it doesn't matter.
See, I think it's you...

01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:32.900
who's sweating this, the both of you.

01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:37.300
People in pool rooms don't come across
this kind of take but once in a lifetime.

01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:40.400
And now you're gonna
put it all on the line against John...

01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:43.200
'cause you think he's gonna choke?
I don't think so.

01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:45.100
I think he's gonna choke.

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:49.700
You want to shoot it all, let's shoot it all.

01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:53.100
-How much you got in your pocket?
-I got a couple of thousand.

01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:55.600
You?

01:16:58.300 --> 01:16:59.400
$500.

01:17:01.300 --> 01:17:03.000
-What about your ring?
-What?

01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:05.800
-How much for your ring?
-You want my ring?

01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:08.100
You said it: "Shoot it all."

01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:11.900
-What's it worth to you?
-I paid $2,800 for it.

01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:14.200
$3,000. Covered.

01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:21.000
I'm gonna leave you with nothing.
Nick, make sure, please, it's all there.

01:17:21.300 --> 01:17:23.900
I'm gonna have a drink. You want a drink?

01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:26.900
All right.

01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:45.800
You watch those nature documentaries
on the cable?

01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:47.600
Yeah.

01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:49.600
See the one about lions?

01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:54.000
Got this lion.

01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:58.600
He's the king of the jungle.
Huge mane, out to here.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.700
He's laying down under a tree,
in the middle of Africa.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.100
He's so big. He's so hot.

01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:09.700
He doesn't want to move.

01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:13.700
The little lion cubs,
they start messing with him.

01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:17.900
Biting his tail, biting his ears.
He doesn't do anything.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:22.300
The lioness, she starts messing with him...

01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:26.400
coming over, making trouble. Still nothing.

01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:29.500
Now, the other animals notice this...

01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:33.500
and they start to move in, the jackals.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.200
Hyenas.

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.500
They're barking at him, laughing at him.

01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:44.500
They nip his toes
and eat the food that's in his domain.

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:46.300
They do this...

01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:50.800
then they get closer and bolder,
till one day...

01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:55.400
that lion gets up
and tears the shit out of everybody...

01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:58.900
runs like the wind,
eats everything in his path.

01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:03.700
'Cause every once in a while,
the lion has to show the jackals...

01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:07.200
who he is.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:15.600
It's too late to be scared. It's time to kill.

01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:20.500
I'm going in the other room.
You come out when you're ready.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Don't beat him. Kick his ass.

01:21:01.700 --> 01:21:03.800
Watch this 2-ball go down.

01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:41.300
Fuck.

01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:45.100
That's fucking bullshit!
I can't fucking believe this.

01:21:47.300 --> 01:21:51.600
I don't know. I think I gotta bank it.
There's nothing else I can do.

01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:54.500
You can do it. It's a two-rail safety.

01:21:54.900 --> 01:21:57.400
I think you're right. Thanks, Nick.

01:22:14.500 --> 01:22:15.800
Good shot.

01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:31.200
Take that, you motherless motherfuckers!

01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:34.400
Stop. Easy. No....

01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:36.500
Shit!

01:22:54.700 --> 01:22:57.200
Shoot the shot already. It's an easy shot.

01:22:57.200 --> 01:23:00.500
-Easy shot, my ass.
-Shows how much you know.

01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:03.300
I can't believe I'm playing
with somebody so fucking stupid.

01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:06.900
I ain't biting on any of your
South Side shark techniques, so shut up.

01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:08.400
The shot can't be made, Brad.

01:23:08.300 --> 01:23:10.800
Believe me,
I'd rather have you shoot it than me.

01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:12.000
Me, too.

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:18.500
-Come on!
-Bullshit.

01:23:18.500 --> 01:23:21.500
If you think it's so easy,
why don't you come and shoot it?

01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:25.300
Believe me, I wish I could.
I'd pay to shoot a shot like that.

01:23:26.100 --> 01:23:28.800
How much is it worth to you, Johnny boy?

01:23:29.100 --> 01:23:30.500
What are you saying?

01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:34.500
You think you can make it. I say
it can't be made. I don't want him doing it.

01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:37.900
So why don't you speak to Daddy Warbucks
and see how much it's worth?

01:23:37.900 --> 01:23:41.700
I don't gotta ask nobody nothing.
That's a tough fucking shot.

01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:43.800
It's worth, maybe, $200 bucks.

01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:48.900
$200? We're playing for $100,000
and you want to offer me $200?

01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:52.400
Offer me $5,000,
and then maybe I'll think about it.

01:23:52.300 --> 01:23:54.100
What are you saying, Joe?

01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:57.800
You don't want to go home broke
once John makes this shot.

01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:00.400
Listen, mister, all due respect...

01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:03.200
but save your money,
'cause you don't know the game.

01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:05.100
The shot can't be made.

01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:07.300
It's up to you.

01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:11.300
Here's your gas money.

01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:14.100
You're gonna need it.

01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:15.400
Excuse me.

01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:27.800
Come on, get legs.

01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:31.500
Fuck!

01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:37.700
What the hell were you thinking?
I told you you couldn't make the shot.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.700
-What are you doing?
-I'm taking my shot.

01:24:47.700 --> 01:24:51.700
See, I just paid $5,000 for your shot.

01:24:52.300 --> 01:24:53.600
Now it's my shot.

01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:58.100
Listen, you can't do that.

01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:02.200
-He just did.
-This is bullshit!

01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:05.000
It's not an old trick
you should have been looking out for.

01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:09.200
-This is fucking bullshit, man!
-Here's what my brother owes you.

01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:12.400
-Fuck you.
-You and I got some unfinished business.

01:25:12.300 --> 01:25:16.300
The rest of y'all clear out.
It's about to get rowdy in this motherfucker.

01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:20.800
-Go!
-Later, Joe.

01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:34.800
A game like that, you should be on the tour.

01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:38.300
I don't think you'd want me beating you
every week.

01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:40.700
You didn't beat me. I got hustled.

01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:45.200
Maybe you did, and maybe you didn't.

01:25:45.300 --> 01:25:48.800
-I guess I'm a hustler.
-Doesn't have to stay that way.

01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:50.800
Think about it.

01:26:07.300 --> 01:26:09.100
Wanna get out of here?

01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:11.900
Let's go get your brother.

01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:14.700
-Wait, we're not going in that.
-What are we going in?

01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:16.500
We're going in that.

01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:20.200
That's my Uncle Mike's car.

01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:23.300
Not anymore. Come on.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
Okay, boys, you ready?

01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:53.200
Go.

01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:21.300
Give me two seconds.... Okay, I'm all right!

01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:23.300
Jesus Christ.

01:27:29.700 --> 01:27:32.500
-I'm telling you, right now--
-No way those are real.

01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:34.600
What we need is a plastic surgeon.

01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:37.900
Shut up! We need a consensus,
all right? Tang?

01:27:37.900 --> 01:27:40.600
They must be real. There's no scar.
I'm going with God.

01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:43.000
Are you retarded?
There's laser technology now.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:46.400
They can remove scars, plus God made
plastic surgery. 100-percent fake.

01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:49.200
I don't know. It's a shot in the dark,
but I'll go with real.

01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:52.900
I can't leave Max hanging on this.
They look great, but a little too amazing.

01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:54.400
I'll say store-bought.

01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:05.300
All right! Is that your final answer?

01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:09.200
Want to take the 50-50? Audience choice?

01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:11.200
-Come on.
-All right, okay!

01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:14.700
All right, Scarlet.
Here's the moment of truth.

01:28:14.700 --> 01:28:18.100
-Are they real, or are they Memorex?
-They're real.

01:28:19.900 --> 01:28:21.000
I knew it!

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:25.100
-Scarlet, they feel hard as a rock.
-Never go swimming. You'll drown.
