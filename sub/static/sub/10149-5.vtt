WEBVTT

01:08.611 --> 01:11.656
I am vengeance. I am the night.

01:11.739 --> 01:13.866
Lam...

01:13.950 --> 01:14.992
<i>Batman</i>

01:15.076 --> 01:16.285
<i>Batman</i>

01:16.369 --> 01:17.787
<i>Batman</i>

01:17.870 --> 01:20.581
<i>There is a song the good folks sing</i>

01:20.665 --> 01:22.583
<i>Song the good folks sing</i>

01:22.667 --> 01:23.960
<i>Batman</i>

01:24.043 --> 01:27.004
<i>About a hero on the wing</i>

01:27.088 --> 01:29.340
<i>Hero on the wing</i>

01:29.423 --> 01:30.841
<i>Batman</i>

01:30.925 --> 01:33.261
<i>I am Gotham's darkest knight</i>

01:33.344 --> 01:35.680
<i>The villain's darkest fright</i>

01:35.763 --> 01:39.058
<i>Turn on the signal light</i>

01:39.141 --> 01:43.104
<i>For Batman</i>

01:43.521 --> 01:44.814
<i>Batman</i>

01:57.326 --> 01:58.536
You hate me, don't you?

01:58.953 --> 02:00.663
Lighten up. It's your birthday.

02:00.746 --> 02:02.456
Don't remind me.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.294
Good work, caped crusader.

02:06.377 --> 02:09.797
Once again, you've saved our fair city
from those vile miscreants.

02:09.880 --> 02:11.590
They were no problem, Commissioner.

02:11.674 --> 02:14.260
For as we all know, criminals are...

02:14.552 --> 02:17.430
<i>A superstitious cowardly lot</i>

02:17.555 --> 02:20.016
<i>They plan and plot
But they always get caught</i>

02:20.433 --> 02:23.227
<i>Their evil schemes all come to naught</i>

02:23.477 --> 02:25.646
<i>A superstitious cowardly lot</i>

02:28.774 --> 02:31.068
Come on, it took me weeks
to get tickets for this show.

02:31.235 --> 02:33.779
- It's schway.
- It's schwarbage.

02:36.407 --> 02:39.827
Excuse me. One side, please. Move!

02:39.910 --> 02:42.788
<i>A superstitious cowardly lot</i>

02:42.872 --> 02:45.791
<i>They plan and plot
But they always get caught</i>

02:45.875 --> 02:48.252
<i>Their evil schemes all come to naught</i>

03:16.989 --> 03:19.742
- What?
- I know you loved her.

03:19.825 --> 03:22.828
But I cannot believe you did not
save a picture of me as well.

03:24.705 --> 03:25.705
Talia...

03:27.833 --> 03:29.293
Happy Birthday, Bruce.

03:29.668 --> 03:32.171
Roast pheasant with truffle risotto.

03:32.254 --> 03:35.257
Just like we shared
in that little bistro in Milan.

03:35.341 --> 03:37.176
I can't eat that anymore.

03:37.676 --> 03:39.845
I'm sorry, I didn't think.

03:39.929 --> 03:41.764
It's been years, Talia.

03:41.847 --> 03:43.891
It seems the Lazarus Pit
agrees with you.

03:43.974 --> 03:46.769
Time has not tempered your sarcasm,
beloved.

03:46.852 --> 03:50.189
My father used
the Lazarus Pit as a crutch.

03:50.272 --> 03:51.941
It is a gift, Bruce.

03:52.191 --> 03:54.276
One which must be used wisely.

03:54.360 --> 03:56.487
A gift I would new share with you.

03:58.322 --> 04:00.908
<i>A superstitious cowardly lot</i>

04:01.867 --> 04:03.411
You missed a great show!

04:03.494 --> 04:05.037
The music, the action.

04:05.329 --> 04:06.997
Mmm! What are you eating? It smells...

04:09.041 --> 04:10.459
gorgeous.

04:11.168 --> 04:13.629
Terry, this is Talia, an old friend.

04:13.712 --> 04:14.964
Talia...

04:15.047 --> 04:17.425
I've been aware of Mr. McGinnis
for some time.

04:17.508 --> 04:19.009
With a new Batman in action,

04:19.093 --> 04:21.345
I knew he had to be
someone close to you.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.264
Terry was the only candidate.

04:23.347 --> 04:25.182
I've heard about you, too.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.039
You're the daughter of Ra's al Ghul,

04:27.101 --> 04:29.395
one of the old man's
worst enemies from way back.

04:29.478 --> 04:31.897
You helped the original Batman
fight Ra's one last time

04:31.981 --> 04:33.357
in the near apocalypse of '09.

04:33.441 --> 04:35.335
For the last couple of decades,
you've been putting

04:35.359 --> 04:37.820
your father's money to work
cleaning up the mess he made.

04:37.903 --> 04:40.614
Current residence is a ZOO-acre
estate on New Cuba.

04:40.990 --> 04:43.492
What? Did you think I was
down here playing vid games?

04:43.868 --> 04:45.369
Very thorough, Terry.

04:45.703 --> 04:48.622
<i>Though Father's name was
pronounced “Radon“ not “Raz.”</i>

04:48.789 --> 04:51.459
- A common mistake.
- Fair enough.

04:51.542 --> 04:53.252
Now, maybe you'll clear up
another mystery.

04:53.544 --> 04:54.879
Why are you here?

04:54.962 --> 04:58.799
To wish an old friend happy birthday
and offer him a gift.

05:00.092 --> 05:02.136
Please consider it, Bruce.

05:03.137 --> 05:04.680
Stay well, beloved.

05:07.475 --> 05:10.227
I'll be at the Gotham Plaza
until tomorrow night.

05:10.311 --> 05:11.729
Goodnight, Talia.

05:15.399 --> 05:16.775
A gift?

05:18.736 --> 05:20.654
Eternal you...

05:24.200 --> 05:26.660
Eternal youth?
You're slammin' me.

05:26.744 --> 05:28.370
That's what I thought at first.

05:28.454 --> 05:31.749
But after everything I've read
on Talia and her father, I believe it.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.392
Do you think the old man's gonna do it?

05:33.459 --> 05:35.669
- Doubtful.
- Well, I'll take his place.

05:35.753 --> 05:38.005
Sorry, Max, Wayne said
those Lazarus Pits

05:38.088 --> 05:39.798
are more trouble than they're worth.

05:41.258 --> 05:43.010
Still, he did waver.

05:43.260 --> 05:44.261
There are times I can see

05:44.345 --> 05:46.425
he wishes it was still him in the suit
instead of me.

05:46.847 --> 05:49.850
You think if he takes the plunge
that” end your Bat nights?

05:49.934 --> 05:52.353
Well, now that you mention it, could be.

06:12.206 --> 06:13.624
Beautiful.

06:27.513 --> 06:28.806
Car trouble, old-timer?

06:30.182 --> 06:31.559
I can manage.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.436
We'll be happy to call roadside service.

06:34.645 --> 06:36.564
Davey, help Grandpa find his car.

06:43.195 --> 06:44.738
Keep away from me, you old freak.

06:49.368 --> 06:50.911
Hey, stop!

06:50.995 --> 06:52.204
Let her go.

06:54.957 --> 06:56.875
You want her? You catch her.

07:00.838 --> 07:01.922
Help!

07:05.342 --> 07:06.468
Come on!

07:21.817 --> 07:24.153
The suit scanner picked up
your car's distress beacon.

07:24.236 --> 07:25.487
You okay?

07:29.491 --> 07:32.745
Even a few years ago,
I could have gotten us both to safety.

07:34.830 --> 07:38.459
I shouldn't be here.
I'm not even sure why I came.

07:39.251 --> 07:41.879
Today, I felt completely helpless.

07:42.087 --> 07:43.756
If Terry hadn't been there,

07:43.839 --> 07:46.133
both that girl and I
would have been killed.

07:46.216 --> 07:49.386
Perhaps it was fate's way
of giving you another chance.

07:49.803 --> 07:52.389
For years, you've devoted
yourself to this city.

07:52.473 --> 07:54.558
It has taken your youth, your strength,

07:54.642 --> 07:56.393
and very nearly, your life.

07:56.769 --> 07:59.396
No one has earned
a second chance more than you.

07:59.480 --> 08:01.607
I was never looking for any reward.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.734
Then do it for me, Bruce.

08:04.652 --> 08:08.572
I want to broaden my philanthropic
corporation to every nation.

08:09.114 --> 08:12.242
Think of the good we could do
if we joined forces.

08:12.409 --> 08:15.621
A dream for the world
and a dream for ourselves.

08:18.540 --> 08:21.001
The pilot says we're cleared
for landing, ma'am.

08:21.085 --> 08:22.544
Thank you, Carter.

08:23.462 --> 08:24.755
You've been so quiet.

08:25.464 --> 08:26.507
Both of you.

08:26.590 --> 08:28.509
I'm having second thoughts.

08:28.592 --> 08:30.761
I understand your reluctance, Bruce.

08:31.261 --> 08:33.472
You saw the pit's effect on my father.

08:33.555 --> 08:36.266
I assure you,
the process is now much safer.

08:36.600 --> 08:37.851
It's not that.

08:37.935 --> 08:40.813
I'm wondering if I have
the right to do this at all.

08:41.230 --> 08:42.898
We've been through all that.

08:43.107 --> 08:44.608
This is our time now.

08:46.068 --> 08:48.570
And I know what's on your mind, Terry.

08:48.654 --> 08:50.572
You're worried that
when Bruce becomes young

08:50.656 --> 08:52.199
he'll want to be Batman again.

08:52.282 --> 08:55.077
I'll tell you right now, there's no way
I'm wearing the Robin suit.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.955
Don't worry.
Bruce's late nights are over.

08:58.247 --> 09:00.958
I'll be keeping him
close by me at all times.

09:15.681 --> 09:17.850
Bruce is ready
to start the process, Terry.

09:20.477 --> 09:22.187
- Terry?
- Oh, sorry.

09:22.271 --> 09:24.565
Guess I got caught up in old Raz here.

09:25.190 --> 09:28.110
Ra's al Ghul was a man
of many contrasts.

09:28.193 --> 09:31.280
- Leader, environmentalist...
- Sociopath.

09:33.991 --> 09:35.075
Sorry.

09:35.159 --> 09:36.827
I was going to say "father."

09:37.077 --> 09:39.204
I think that's how
he'd like to be remembered.

09:48.839 --> 09:52.092
Let me say again how safe
the process is, beloved.

09:52.176 --> 09:54.970
- There will be no pain.
- Let's get it over with.

10:29.421 --> 10:30.839
Enough!

10:51.318 --> 10:52.402
He's so young.

10:52.486 --> 10:53.946
Bruce, you okay?

11:02.079 --> 11:04.832
A side effect of the pit's
restorative powers.

11:08.043 --> 11:10.921
Believe me,
it's not nearly as bad as it once was.

11:17.636 --> 11:19.012
That's not very reassuring.

11:24.268 --> 11:26.854
Good morning, Bruce.
You're looking well.

11:33.569 --> 11:35.153
I left in some grey.

11:35.237 --> 11:37.364
I thought it looked distinguished.

11:37.447 --> 11:38.699
Like Ra's.

11:38.782 --> 11:40.701
Thank you for the miracle, Talia.

11:40.868 --> 11:42.744
Thank you for restoring my youth.

11:45.497 --> 11:48.083
I'm sorry, I don't mean
to be ungrateful.

11:48.542 --> 11:50.252
It's just that this is so new.

11:50.335 --> 11:51.336
I understand.

11:51.420 --> 11:53.171
It will take several more immersions

11:53.255 --> 11:55.591
before the rejuvenation truly sets in.

11:55.674 --> 11:57.718
But you will accept it all in time.

12:06.518 --> 12:07.603
Wow!

12:07.728 --> 12:09.771
I always wondered
what you were like at your peak.

12:09.980 --> 12:11.315
Now, I have some idea.

12:11.398 --> 12:12.900
Not quite at my peak.

12:12.983 --> 12:15.183
But certainly better than
I've been capable of in years.

12:15.319 --> 12:17.654
The agility, the stamina, everything.

12:17.738 --> 12:18.822
It's all coming back to me.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.284
Hey!

12:23.035 --> 12:25.162
It's unnatural. A cheat.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.622
But you're strong again.

12:26.705 --> 12:29.541
No, if I stay here,
I'll be weaker than ever.

12:29.625 --> 12:31.501
I heard a noise, sir.

12:32.294 --> 12:34.796
- Is something wrong?
- We're leaving.

12:34.880 --> 12:37.633
Afraid that's not
in the boss's plan, sir.

12:37.716 --> 12:38.926
Then I'll tell her myself.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.904
- Shall we?
- After you.

13:16.630 --> 13:17.923
We're out of here right now.

13:25.347 --> 13:27.599
I gave orders
not to be disturbed.

13:27.683 --> 13:29.685
It's him... Ra's!

13:32.562 --> 13:34.314
- Bruce?
- I heard him, Talia.

13:34.398 --> 13:35.899
Where's Ra's?

13:36.024 --> 13:38.527
I did not want you to find out this way.

13:38.819 --> 13:41.488
But I suppose what is done is done...

13:41.863 --> 13:43.240
Detective.

14:02.092 --> 14:04.553
The bite isn't what
finishes 'em, you know?

14:04.636 --> 14:06.346
That's just to get a good grip.

14:06.430 --> 14:08.849
- Is that right?
- Oh, yeah.

14:09.099 --> 14:11.393
You should stick around
and watch sometime, Mikey.

14:11.476 --> 14:13.103
It's fascinating.

14:14.104 --> 14:15.480
Get help, Carl.

14:15.564 --> 14:17.899
What? I like to watch.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.318
- Is that so wrong?
- Just throw him in.

14:29.953 --> 14:31.038
Oh, no, you don't.

14:41.465 --> 14:42.465
Ah!

14:46.595 --> 14:47.846
It is fascinating.

14:53.268 --> 14:54.269
Security!

15:00.275 --> 15:04.071
You always were
the perfect specimen, Detective.

15:04.154 --> 15:07.616
Even old age has not softened
you as much as I had feared.

15:07.699 --> 15:10.494
I should have known
you'd cheat death again, Ra's.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.996
I don't cheat death, I master it.

15:13.080 --> 15:17.542
Though I assure you, this time
my longevity comes at a price most dear.

15:18.043 --> 15:19.336
Talia.

15:21.713 --> 15:24.341
I did indeed survive our last battle.

15:24.424 --> 15:28.178
But my body was broken far beyond
the pit's powers to heal.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.138
In order to save my life,

15:30.222 --> 15:34.059
I called upon Talia to undertake
the ultimate act of loyalty.

15:34.142 --> 15:36.269
You sacrificed her.

15:36.353 --> 15:37.687
Your own daughter.

15:37.771 --> 15:39.815
I did what I had to do.

15:39.898 --> 15:43.235
At the time, this computer could only
imprint my thoughts and memories

15:43.318 --> 15:45.570
on a close genetic match.

15:45.946 --> 15:49.783
But now, this youthful form
has served its purpose.

15:50.075 --> 15:52.744
I must move on to a new host body.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.831
- Yours.
- Sure, Ra's, why not?

15:55.914 --> 15:59.334
Anything to hold off
the Grim Reaper another few seconds.

15:59.417 --> 16:01.002
I take it back.

16:01.086 --> 16:02.712
You don't cheat death.

16:02.796 --> 16:04.589
You whimper in fear of it.

16:05.632 --> 16:06.632
SHence!

16:08.885 --> 16:10.637
And you hit like a girl.

16:16.852 --> 16:19.146
You take your men down to the beach.

16:19.229 --> 16:21.898
You search the swamp.
Nothing leaves this estate.

16:21.982 --> 16:23.191
Do you understand?

16:23.275 --> 16:24.693
Yes, sir.

16:37.247 --> 16:38.748
Where's Wayne?

16:39.082 --> 16:42.419
Don't waste your contempt
on me, Detective.

16:42.502 --> 16:46.214
When Talia offered you youth again,
you fairly drooled to take it.

16:51.178 --> 16:53.054
A simple blow to your ego.

16:53.138 --> 16:56.600
That staged incident with the flat tire
was all I needed to ensnare you.

16:58.435 --> 17:01.271
I guess for a moment
I was as weak as you, Ra's.

17:03.565 --> 17:07.569
This computer will finally
still that insolent tongue.

17:08.111 --> 17:11.656
I've refined it so I no longer
need a genetic match.

17:12.115 --> 17:16.328
Your brain waves will be purged
as mine are implanted in their place.

17:16.411 --> 17:18.872
I shall return to Gotham in your stead.

17:18.955 --> 17:21.666
Bringing with me proof,
both written and genetic,

17:21.750 --> 17:26.546
that I am the long-forgotten
son of Bruce Wayne and Talia.

17:26.630 --> 17:30.425
How ironic that your company and
holdings will fund my new empire.

17:34.429 --> 17:35.805
No!

17:35.889 --> 17:38.183
Lady, that is the sickest thing
I've ever seen.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.060
You're creeping me out.

17:40.143 --> 17:42.020
You? She kissed me.

17:48.068 --> 17:49.068
Ah!

17:56.368 --> 17:58.828
I underestimated you, boy.

17:58.912 --> 18:01.122
I won't do so again.

18:14.135 --> 18:15.135
Look out.

18:52.674 --> 18:55.677
No! I need the computer,
it mustn't be destroyed!

19:17.032 --> 19:18.366
It's safe.

19:26.666 --> 19:29.210
I'm going back.
Maybe I can still save her.

19:29.502 --> 19:32.297
Whatever was in there died years ago.

19:55.695 --> 19:58.448
- More grey hair today.
- I'm not crying.

19:58.531 --> 20:00.658
Within a week,
I should be back to normal.

20:00.950 --> 20:03.703
I'm sorry I never met her,
the real Talia.

20:03.953 --> 20:07.082
- She was a very special woman.
- "The" special woman?

20:07.165 --> 20:09.834
You going on patrol sometime tonight?

20:10.210 --> 20:12.087
See you in the morning.

20:18.676 --> 20:20.261
Rest well, beloved.
