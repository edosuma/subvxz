00:06.629 --> 00:08.290
Previously on E.R.

00:08.291 --> 00:09.999
Carter. You and Harper?

00:10.000 --> 00:11.992
Something extracurricular
happening there?

00:13.210 --> 00:14.685
I thought we were practicing medicine.

00:14.686 --> 00:18.585
I'll tell you something. If it was your kid,
you would bet on a miracle!

00:18.586 --> 00:20.772
- He tried to warn you.
- About what?

00:21.466 --> 00:22.950
Messing with a married woman.

00:22.951 --> 00:25.349
- He stopped moving.
- He surrendered.

00:26.695 --> 00:28.338
I'm keeping her.

00:30.281 --> 00:32.467
What do you do after a day like today?

00:33.108 --> 00:36.214
I tend to drink,
but I'm not the best role model.

00:37.981 --> 00:40.849
"Days like this"

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:54.235 --> 00:55.610
Sorry.

01:00.237 --> 01:02.643
Doug Ross. Leave a message.

01:02.821 --> 01:05.275
Doug, it's Mark. You there? Pick up.

01:05.447 --> 01:07.936
Hello, hello. You there?

01:09.115 --> 01:13.441
Listen, I left that sub-I paperwork
on the kitchen table and I need it.

01:13.616 --> 01:15.109
Doug...

01:15.700 --> 01:17.109
Doug.

01:23.827 --> 01:25.652
Shut up, man.

01:26.453 --> 01:29.120
- Oh, man.
- You little...

01:39.581 --> 01:41.572
Put this on your face.

01:44.666 --> 01:48.246
He was here in the ER.
They moved him up to Surgery.

01:48.417 --> 01:50.657
You have one thing to do,
I have 13 million.

01:50.834 --> 01:52.209
Dr. Weaver wants those films.

01:52.376 --> 01:54.451
She's not somebody
you wanna mess with.

01:54.627 --> 01:56.914
Hey, watch your mouth.

01:57.086 --> 01:59.456
I hope you're not Carol Hathaway.

01:59.628 --> 02:01.619
Do I look like a nurse?

02:05.797 --> 02:08.037
I'm very sorry, but...

02:08.214 --> 02:12.873
Just wait in the waiting room. I don't
have any information about your son.

02:13.049 --> 02:15.716
Wendy, can you help me
with Mrs. Valdez?

02:15.883 --> 02:19.296
They took her kid up to Surgery
about an hour ago.

02:22.801 --> 02:25.291
- Hey.
- Hey, Jerry, what's going on?

02:25.469 --> 02:28.040
Some serious gangbanging
in the wee hours.

02:28.219 --> 02:30.294
Cops did a sweep
right under our carpet.

02:30.470 --> 02:32.545
- Trauma 1 or 2?
- Take your pick.

02:32.721 --> 02:35.589
- That's your girl.
- Miss Hathaway?

02:35.763 --> 02:39.461
- Abraham Zimble, the mobile notary.
- Oh, thank you so much for coming.

02:39.639 --> 02:42.128
- Your escrow papers.
- I have to sign all of those?

02:42.307 --> 02:45.638
- By 5, or you won't get the house.
- Do you mind waiting?

02:45.808 --> 02:48.510
- Twenty dollars an hour. No problem.
- Great. Out there.

02:48.683 --> 02:51.303
BP's dropping to 80/40. Pulse 150.

02:51.476 --> 02:53.965
- Cap refill is slowing down.
- Resps 36, labored.

02:54.143 --> 02:57.225
- Need anything?
- Don't suppose you brought coffee?

02:57.394 --> 03:02.183
Done with that portable yet? Call O.R.,
let them do the x-rays up there.

03:02.354 --> 03:06.811
See if Susan needs help.
And tell her to stop hogging that x-ray!

03:07.397 --> 03:10.349
- You're supposed to stop hogging that.
- She's all theirs.

03:10.523 --> 03:14.019
- Too late. They took him. What's he got?
- GSW to the face and abdomen.

03:14.190 --> 03:16.644
He's a she. Couldn't tell
till we cut open his shirt.

03:16.816 --> 03:20.147
- Abdomen's distended, no bowel sounds.
- I'll prep for lavage.

03:20.317 --> 03:23.481
- You and Kerry the only ones on?
- Carter and Benton are in surgery.

03:23.651 --> 03:26.484
Paged Ross, no answer.
Mark's on the train from Milwaukee.

03:26.652 --> 03:29.320
- Just us womenfolk.
- What's up with that?

03:29.486 --> 03:33.351
Oh, yeah, Malik, see what's keeping
that O-neg, would you?

03:52.159 --> 03:53.782
Doug.

03:57.244 --> 03:59.152
What are you doing here?

03:59.328 --> 04:00.987
- You didn't get my message?
- Message?

04:01.162 --> 04:05.867
I left the sub-I paperwork here and
Morgenstern wants to review it today.

04:06.038 --> 04:10.412
- Hurry up and I'll ride in with you.
- No, I don't want to make you late.

04:10.581 --> 04:13.663
- No, I'm already late.
- No, I'm gonna run some errands.

04:13.832 --> 04:16.368
- It's okay.
- Your beeper's going...

04:16.541 --> 04:17.868
...off.

04:19.791 --> 04:21.119
Morning.

04:30.253 --> 04:33.501
- Look, it's not what you think.
- But it's what I've seen, isn't it?

04:33.670 --> 04:37.500
- The hell's that supposed to mean?
- I've overlooked a lot of your behavior.

04:37.672 --> 04:40.505
- Now a medical student?
- All right, Mark, look, wait-

04:40.672 --> 04:44.881
There are rules. You can't go break them
all the time and expect me to do nothing.

04:45.049 --> 04:48.664
You don't get it, do you, Doug?
You could be out on your butt for this.

04:48.841 --> 04:52.457
- And I could be too for not reporting it.
- Mark, wait-

04:52.634 --> 04:55.040
Okay, that's fine.

05:53.380 --> 05:56.165
I told you, you're gonna have to wait.

05:56.339 --> 05:58.874
Don't make me say it again.

05:59.047 --> 06:01.750
- Have you seen Dr. Greene?
- He's busy.

06:02.298 --> 06:04.170
- Forever.
- My name is Jeanie Boulet.

06:04.340 --> 06:06.627
We haven't met.
I'm a new physician assistant.

06:06.799 --> 06:10.709
- I start my ER rotation today.
- Who died and gave you their bad luck?

06:10.882 --> 06:14.462
You'll need one of these.
They're a lousy fit, but it's all we've got.

06:14.633 --> 06:18.876
- Hey, next time you stay, I'll go to X-ray.
- Sorry.

06:19.050 --> 06:20.958
Hey, Jeanie. You starting this morning?

06:21.134 --> 06:23.837
Jerry, I need those films before the end
of the millennium.

06:24.010 --> 06:25.254
- Just came in.
- Thank you.

06:25.427 --> 06:28.674
- Jeanie Boulet, new physician assistant.
- Kerry Weaver, Chief Resident.

06:28.844 --> 06:32.790
First day? You'll find it's
a vaguely friendly crowd.

06:32.970 --> 06:37.047
My first day was certainly a bundle
of open arms. What do you think?

06:37.221 --> 06:40.421
Looks like a comminuted fracture
of the distal femur...

06:40.596 --> 06:43.760
- ... and a midshaft humerus-
- Excuse me.

06:43.930 --> 06:46.336
Fifty percent apposition,
30 degrees of angulation.

06:46.514 --> 06:49.962
- Know your way around an x-ray. Good.
- I was a physical therapist.

06:50.139 --> 06:52.806
All right, on my count. One, two, three.

06:52.973 --> 06:56.304
What have we got, Peter? Peter!

06:57.224 --> 07:01.929
Gunshot wound to the posterior neck.
Facial abrasions, scalp lacerations.

07:02.100 --> 07:07.054
- BP's 90/60. Pulse 92. Resps 24.
- Cap refill's poor.

07:08.101 --> 07:10.387
- All right, let's tube him.
- I'll do it.

07:10.559 --> 07:14.341
ETtray's on the counter. 7.0.

07:15.394 --> 07:19.055
This is Jeanie Boulet, Peter.
Physician assistant.

07:19.394 --> 07:22.512
It's her first day and I know
we all wanna make her feel welcome.

07:24.687 --> 07:27.390
No guarding or rebound tenderness.
Normal bowel sounds.

07:27.563 --> 07:30.395
Let's find Radiology.
What do we need for x-rays?

07:30.563 --> 07:32.222
- Cross-table and-
- Jeanie.

07:32.397 --> 07:35.929
- Cross-table C-spine, chest and pelvis.
- Let's get a gram of Ancef.

07:36.106 --> 07:39.886
Good choice, Peter.
Everyone is so on their toes today.

07:40.064 --> 07:42.767
- Film's back on Trujillo.
- He's next door.

07:43.440 --> 07:44.684
Except for Wendy.

07:47.608 --> 07:49.812
- Chest, stomach, back.
- X-rays on Trujillo.

07:49.983 --> 07:52.686
- He's already gone up to the O.R.
- This is Rico Figueroa.

07:52.859 --> 07:55.182
If you could you get his films,
we'd appreciate it.

07:57.276 --> 07:58.934
- Is he gonna live?
- Yes.

08:06.278 --> 08:08.316
Trying a little rehabilitation there,
Chuny?

08:08.486 --> 08:11.983
- Mark? I gotta talk to you.
- This is not the time or place.

08:14.321 --> 08:17.106
- We need to talk.
- Could you ask him to squeeze my finger?

08:17.280 --> 08:19.946
- Come on.
- I said no, Doug. Get the hell out of here.

08:23.489 --> 08:27.898
Okay, Carter, sixth intercostal space
at midaxillary line.

08:28.073 --> 08:29.186
Then puncture the pleura.

08:29.406 --> 08:31.279
We got a cop, hurt,
pulling up to the back.

08:31.448 --> 08:32.905
- How bad?
- His hand.

08:33.073 --> 08:35.397
- Carol, why don't you check it out.
- Okay.

08:38.991 --> 08:42.440
Her son is up in the O.R.
She's been hysterical all morning.

08:42.616 --> 08:48.236
- Put her in the Surgery waiting room.
- And leave Randi alone? She'll kill me.

08:48.410 --> 08:51.242
Okay, okay. Mrs. Valdez...

08:52.077 --> 08:54.862
- Is it calming down a bit?
- Sort of.

08:55.036 --> 08:57.704
- Have you seen Mr. Zimble?
- Who?

08:57.870 --> 09:00.951
- Bald guy. A lot of papers.
- In the cafeteria. Have you seen Jerry?

09:01.120 --> 09:02.910
- He's upstairs.
- I'm gonna kill him.

09:03.079 --> 09:05.533
Whatever, but help me with this first.

09:05.705 --> 09:09.568
- Grabarsky, what happened?
- Dumb son of a bitch bit me.

09:09.747 --> 09:13.113
- Your stupid dog bit me first!
- That's what she's supposed to do, idiot!

09:13.289 --> 09:15.992
- Where do you want him?
- Nowhere near me.

09:16.165 --> 09:18.867
- Piss off, culera.
- What did you call me?

09:19.040 --> 09:21.446
Huh? What did you call me?

09:22.749 --> 09:25.321
What did you call me?
What did you call me?!

09:25.500 --> 09:28.616
- What is the matter with you?
- Here, tough girl, hold the dog.

09:28.791 --> 09:32.205
You! Now, lie down and shut up!

09:32.376 --> 09:34.450
Grabarsky, I need to look at your hand.

09:34.626 --> 09:36.913
- Hold on to Peggy for me.
- I'd love to.

09:37.085 --> 09:40.533
- Randi, page Bernstein for me, please.
- Gee, I'd love to. Come on, Peggy.

09:40.710 --> 09:44.787
- Al? Al, are you all right?
- Yeah, some moron bit me.

09:44.961 --> 09:48.044
- I'll take him.
- Look out, look out.

09:48.212 --> 09:51.744
- Carter, you wanna take him up?
- I should check in with Benton.

09:51.921 --> 09:53.711
Dr. Greene.

09:54.421 --> 09:58.251
- Sorry. I need to talk to you.
- Lounge in 20 minutes.

09:58.423 --> 10:01.337
- So, what's it look like out there?
- I think the worst is over.

10:01.506 --> 10:03.959
Never say the worst is over.

10:08.590 --> 10:11.293
Oh, my God! Mr. Zimble?

10:11.466 --> 10:15.543
Went to get a doughnut and the cashier
was picking him up off the floor.

10:15.717 --> 10:17.127
I'll get Rico.

10:17.301 --> 10:18.415
Mr. Zimble?

10:18.592 --> 10:20.215
Passed out right into
his Cream of Wheat.

10:20.384 --> 10:22.375
- Who's Mr. Zimble?
- My mobile notary.

10:22.551 --> 10:23.665
What?

10:23.843 --> 10:26.415
My escrow closes today.
Have to sign by 5.

10:26.594 --> 10:29.627
- You bought a house?
- Well, I got a great deal. Mr. Zimble?

10:31.428 --> 10:34.628
I could never buy a house. It's too scary.

10:34.803 --> 10:37.719
It's not that bad. You get over it.

10:37.888 --> 10:40.008
- I didn't know you bought a house.
- I haven't-

10:40.179 --> 10:44.470
- Mark, shut up and help save this guy.
- Yes, thank you, Carol. I think I will.

10:44.638 --> 10:47.590
Mr. Zimble, there you go.
Come on. Hi.

10:51.181 --> 10:53.089
- Can I help with anything?
- We've managed.

10:53.265 --> 10:55.137
- Jeanie, how are you?
- Fine, thanks.

10:55.307 --> 10:57.927
- Pulse ox falling, 82 on 50 percent.
- Hang those two units.

10:58.099 --> 11:00.303
- I didn't realize you were starting.
- I finished.

11:00.474 --> 11:03.971
- BP!
-91/50. Pulse 112.

11:04.142 --> 11:06.548
- Must be great to be done with classes.
- Definitely.

11:06.726 --> 11:09.677
- Are you gonna miss rehab-?
- What the hell you yapping for?!

11:09.851 --> 11:12.554
All right, then assess
the patient, all right?

11:13.435 --> 11:16.434
Penetrating trauma to zone two
of the neck...

11:16.603 --> 11:19.636
...can result in tracheal compression...

11:19.811 --> 11:22.300
...secondary to hematoma formation
from subclavian...

11:22.478 --> 11:24.220
...or internal carotid injury...

11:24.395 --> 11:27.180
...which is probably why you're doing
a bronchoscopy.

11:27.438 --> 11:31.052
- Anything else I can help with?
- Yes, we've used the last blood gasket.

11:31.230 --> 11:34.561
It would be extremely helpful if you
would go and make some more.

11:35.731 --> 11:39.179
You mean actually go
and make them up?

11:39.356 --> 11:44.347
Syringe, label, alcohol wipes,
little plastic bags.

11:46.691 --> 11:48.019
Right.

11:55.484 --> 11:58.483
- Sorry. Sort of. Morning.
- Hi.

11:58.651 --> 12:02.562
What a day. Benton is in
the foulest mood I've ever seen...

12:02.735 --> 12:04.525
...which is saying quite a lot.

12:04.694 --> 12:08.274
Greene yelled at Ross right in the middle
of a trauma, in front of everybody.

12:08.445 --> 12:11.478
- About what?
- No clue. Hey, are you off tonight?

12:11.653 --> 12:15.979
I've got two tickets
to the Blues Traveler. It'll be great.

12:16.155 --> 12:18.560
No, it won't. I mean, I don't think...

12:20.071 --> 12:23.105
I need to talk to you privately.

12:25.198 --> 12:28.280
- What?
- Later.

12:29.031 --> 12:30.690
Wait. Wait. What?

12:30.865 --> 12:33.070
- Harper, wait a minute. What is it?
- Nothing.

12:33.241 --> 12:36.323
No, it's something. Yeah? So tell me.

12:38.367 --> 12:40.322
What's going on? Just tell me.

12:41.575 --> 12:43.033
Harper, just-

12:43.201 --> 12:45.690
I slept with Doug Ross.

12:48.285 --> 12:49.825
Last night.

12:59.203 --> 13:01.360
Let's move. Here we go.

13:02.079 --> 13:03.951
Carter, let's go.

13:17.374 --> 13:22.114
Hey, yo, señoritas, could I get a little
medical attention here, please?

13:22.291 --> 13:24.958
Hello? Hello?

13:26.375 --> 13:29.906
- What is his problem?
- Peggy had a little snack.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.865
You gonna let me go?

13:35.043 --> 13:37.248
- Give him to Benton.
- Just went up to Surgery.

13:37.419 --> 13:39.788
This is brutality and neglect.

13:39.960 --> 13:45.081
- He's young enough for a pediatrician.
- Ross is doing a consult with Bernstein.

13:45.253 --> 13:47.043
Jeanie...

13:51.045 --> 13:55.585
About time. I hate to bleed to death
all over your pretty floor.

13:55.755 --> 13:58.623
Gonna add another scar
to your collection there, Jorge.

13:58.797 --> 14:02.494
I have to clean these bites with peroxide.
It's gonna hurt.

14:02.673 --> 14:05.541
- Stop it!
- Come on, you're a big boy.

14:16.217 --> 14:18.541
Oh, my ear!

14:22.926 --> 14:24.834
- Nice work.
- Thanks.

14:25.969 --> 14:28.670
Just don't tell my parole officer.

14:32.136 --> 14:33.795
What kind of bicycle do you have?

14:33.970 --> 14:35.878
A mountain bike,
except now it's trashed.

14:36.054 --> 14:39.301
- He's not getting another one.
- Just flipped out from under you?

14:39.470 --> 14:41.841
- I hit a curb.
- He was unconscious for five minutes.

14:42.013 --> 14:45.628
Dr. Ross told me. Touch my finger.
Now touch your nose.

14:45.805 --> 14:48.093
Again. Good.

14:48.264 --> 14:52.305
He seems in pretty good shape.
You have nothing to worry about.

14:52.473 --> 14:55.674
- Dr. Ross.
- I'll be right back.

14:55.849 --> 14:59.179
- Kid's fine. No need to be admitted.
- Five minutes ago he was disoriented.

14:59.349 --> 15:03.011
- He's alert and oriented. CT's negative.
- He could go squirrelly again.

15:03.183 --> 15:06.182
He should have frequent neuro checks
for 24 hours.

15:06.351 --> 15:09.218
- His mother can wake him up.
- Family situation is questionable.

15:09.392 --> 15:12.474
Mr. O'Connor left his wife and child.
She's extremely distraught.

15:12.643 --> 15:14.220
I don't know that she would do it.

15:14.394 --> 15:18.519
There's no medical reason for this kid
to spend a full day in the ICU.

15:18.685 --> 15:21.684
Send him home. End of consult.

15:23.812 --> 15:27.095
- Where's Randi?
- She's on a break.

15:27.271 --> 15:30.304
- I bet it was assault.
- She's obviously good at it.

15:30.479 --> 15:33.229
- I bet she's good at murder too.
- Murder?

15:33.397 --> 15:38.388
- They would never have let her out.
- My money's on grand theft auto.

15:38.565 --> 15:41.053
- Assault.
- Theft.

15:41.231 --> 15:45.060
- Kidnapping.
- Have you seen Dr. Benton?

15:45.232 --> 15:47.188
He's with a patient in 2.

15:47.358 --> 15:49.976
Jerry, with all the commotion
you probably missed lunch.

15:50.149 --> 15:53.812
You should just order in a burger and
fries or something. Eat here at the desk.

15:53.984 --> 15:57.682
I got a 12-year-old, Joseph O'Connor,
in Curtain Area 2.

15:57.860 --> 16:01.356
I want you to admit him to Pedes ICU.
24-hour observation, please.

16:01.526 --> 16:02.724
Sure.

16:05.319 --> 16:09.609
The chest x-ray suggests that you may
have an aortic aneurysm.

16:09.778 --> 16:11.935
We need to do an arteriogram
to rule it out.

16:12.112 --> 16:14.186
I don't feel the pain
in my chest anymore.

16:14.362 --> 16:17.444
Well, that's because you're medicated,
but that could be deceiving.

16:18.488 --> 16:20.525
- How are you feeling, Mr. Lake?
- Much better.

16:20.696 --> 16:23.897
- BP's 150/90. Heart rate's 96.
- That's very good.

16:24.072 --> 16:26.857
We'll keep the drip
while we study your aortic arch.

16:27.031 --> 16:30.314
What about the surgery he's talking
about? This Dr. Vu...

16:30.490 --> 16:34.188
- Vucelich.
- Do you know him?

16:34.366 --> 16:36.653
No, Dr. Lewis isn't on the surgical team.

16:36.825 --> 16:40.605
Dr. Vucelich is one of the best
cardiovascular surgeons in the country.

16:40.783 --> 16:43.948
He's doing very advanced work
on aortic aneurysms.

16:45.326 --> 16:47.033
So he's the best one to help me?

16:47.410 --> 16:50.858
Well, we're not even sure that you're
going to need his help, Mr. Lake.

16:51.035 --> 16:55.030
Which is why I called Dr. Vucelich
for a second opinion.

16:56.120 --> 16:58.360
Well, you'll be going to X-ray
in a few minutes.

16:58.537 --> 17:02.401
It's premature to discuss your condition
before we've seen the films. Okay?

17:02.579 --> 17:05.613
Dr. Benton, could I speak to you
for a minute?

17:08.579 --> 17:11.531
- Why are you stepping in on my patient?
- Could be surgical.

17:11.704 --> 17:14.490
The chance to cut
is a chance to cure, right?

17:14.664 --> 17:16.952
Look at the arteriogram
and let Cardiology decide.

17:17.123 --> 17:19.030
And Vucelich. He's agreed to consult.

17:19.205 --> 17:22.787
What are you doing? Trying to use my
patient to get in on his research study?

17:22.957 --> 17:25.873
He's doing clamp-and-run surgeries
on aortic aneurysms.

17:26.041 --> 17:28.709
The big cheese has you jumping
through hoops to find one?

17:28.875 --> 17:33.332
- I've never even met him.
- Peter, Susan, is there a problem?

17:33.501 --> 17:34.875
- No.
- Good.

17:35.043 --> 17:37.995
Peter, if you don't mind,
I think I'm gonna need a few stitches.

17:38.169 --> 17:40.835
On my way to Radiology.
I'll meet you in the suture room.

17:41.002 --> 17:44.120
Anytime. It's just my ear.

17:59.005 --> 18:01.672
- How you doing?
- I'm fine.

18:01.839 --> 18:04.754
If we get a chance...

18:04.923 --> 18:10.161
I'm usually kind of glad to avoid
the morning-after stuff.

18:12.383 --> 18:14.338
- I'm sorry.
- You don't need to apologize.

18:14.508 --> 18:17.377
- I was there too.
- I know. If Mark hadn't come out-

18:17.551 --> 18:20.003
We would've already had this,
kind of, awkward...

18:20.175 --> 18:23.423
...kind of, yikes-what-did-we-do
conversation.

18:24.885 --> 18:27.374
So I'll see you around. Okay?

18:27.552 --> 18:30.219
Okay. Yeah, I'll see you around.

18:33.970 --> 18:36.210
Maybe this job is too stressful.

18:36.387 --> 18:40.215
- Being a notary?
- If it's causing this heart attack.

18:40.387 --> 18:42.260
- You might have just fainted.
- I don't know.

18:42.429 --> 18:44.172
This business can be rough.

18:45.222 --> 18:48.671
Ninety-eight percent of my clients
are homebuyers, like you.

18:48.847 --> 18:51.715
So many papers to sign.
They never stop to read them.

18:51.889 --> 18:54.805
I tell them to, but they don't.

18:55.849 --> 18:57.306
It's so hard to watch.

18:57.474 --> 18:59.263
They get nervous,
frightened, tense...

18:59.432 --> 19:01.139
...thinking about the mortgage
every month...

19:01.308 --> 19:05.219
...and the down payment which just
wiped out their entire life savings.

19:05.392 --> 19:08.059
Little beads of sweat break out.

19:08.226 --> 19:12.220
Cheeks get flushed,
their fingers clammy.

19:12.393 --> 19:14.265
Any minute they could lose their job...

19:14.477 --> 19:16.847
...or get disabled
in a horrifying industrial accident.

19:17.019 --> 19:19.389
Within five years there's
that balloon payment.

19:19.561 --> 19:21.552
Husbands and wives are screaming.

19:21.728 --> 19:25.308
Women are crying,
grown men throwing up.

19:27.855 --> 19:30.141
Very stressful.

19:30.313 --> 19:32.304
Can I have a glass of water?

19:44.399 --> 19:47.018
You had Radiology rush these up
to Dr. Vucelich, right?

19:47.233 --> 19:48.477
Yeah.

19:49.399 --> 19:52.398
Type lll dissection,
by the DeBakey classification.

19:52.567 --> 19:57.225
Yeah, but- Gosh, that's only
four centimeters, right?

19:57.401 --> 20:00.731
No signs of pericardial tamponade.
Aortic valve is normal.

20:00.901 --> 20:02.976
When you examined him,
did you appreciate...

20:03.152 --> 20:05.606
...the murmur of aortic insufficiency?

20:06.361 --> 20:07.819
- No.
- Neither did I.

20:07.987 --> 20:10.273
Looks like he doesn't need surgery
after all.

20:10.445 --> 20:13.562
Oh, well, I'm sure Vucelich won't mind
coming down anyway, will he?

20:13.737 --> 20:16.309
I heard he's a pretty easygoing guy.

20:16.488 --> 20:18.775
It's still a good time to meet him.

20:24.989 --> 20:27.064
Don't forget your charts.

20:29.739 --> 20:32.276
Dr. Vucelich, please.

20:32.449 --> 20:34.440
Dr. Benton.

20:43.326 --> 20:44.735
Hey.

20:48.868 --> 20:51.736
- Wanna talk?
- Sure it's the right time and place?

20:51.910 --> 20:54.115
- Fine, forget it.
- You don't have to worry...

20:54.286 --> 20:57.866
- ... about what you saw this morning.
- I worry about what I see every morning.

20:58.037 --> 21:00.359
You fight with Kerry Weaver
over half your cases...

21:00.537 --> 21:02.824
...call in curbside consults,
fast-track patients.

21:02.996 --> 21:04.537
- What are you doing?
- The job.

21:04.704 --> 21:07.786
- That's not what Bernstein thinks.
- He doesn't know squat about ER.

21:07.955 --> 21:10.526
- He knows about your cases.
- Because you're telling him.

21:10.705 --> 21:12.696
He reads the charts.
He's head of Pediatrics.

21:12.872 --> 21:15.954
- I didn't seduce her, Mark.
- It doesn't matter how it happened.

21:16.123 --> 21:18.826
- Harper's third-year. There are rules.
- Stupid rule.

21:18.998 --> 21:20.325
What difference does it make?

21:20.498 --> 21:22.240
You get caught breaking them,
you're out.

21:22.416 --> 21:24.407
I get caught not reporting them, I'm out.

21:24.583 --> 21:27.582
- Report me. I don't care.
- You don't care about anyone, do you?

21:27.750 --> 21:31.033
I didn't do this alone, Mark.
She's 21 years old.

21:31.209 --> 21:34.160
What about Carter?
You care about him?

21:34.334 --> 21:36.491
He and Harper are going out,
or didn't you know?

21:36.668 --> 21:39.453
- It's got nothing to do with Carter.
- No, it's all about you.

21:39.627 --> 21:41.831
It's always all about you.

21:52.212 --> 21:55.081
Thanks for dropping by, Peter.
I was gonna have Jeanie do it.

21:55.255 --> 21:58.621
But seeing as you're here,
why don't you just talk her through it?

22:01.381 --> 22:03.834
Do a local block by depositing
one percent xylocaine...

22:04.006 --> 22:06.875
...behind the auricle from
the inferior to the superior pole...

22:07.049 --> 22:10.046
...knocking out the greater auricular
and lesser occipital nerve.

22:10.215 --> 22:14.340
Irrigate with normal saline, close
with interrupted 6-0 nylon suture...

22:14.508 --> 22:17.875
...dress with antibiotic ointment,
wound check two days...

22:18.051 --> 22:21.214
...suture removal four days,
update the tetanus.

22:22.384 --> 22:24.873
He's nothing if not thorough.

22:25.177 --> 22:28.875
- Gotta drop these off at Radiology.
- Okay, great. Thanks.

22:29.052 --> 22:31.173
- Breaking and entering.
- Give her more credit.

22:31.344 --> 22:35.209
I think she bashed in her boyfriend's car,
found a knife and carved him up.

22:35.387 --> 22:36.761
Do we have to be that specific?

22:36.929 --> 22:39.631
Wanna guess as to why
Randi was in jail?

22:39.804 --> 22:42.886
Do you think you should mock what
must have been a demoralizing...

22:43.055 --> 22:46.219
...dehumanizing, debilitating experience?

22:46.389 --> 22:49.422
Excuse me, can someone direct me
to a Dr. Benton?

22:49.597 --> 22:52.679
- Yeah, who are you?
- I'm Carl Vucelich.

22:52.848 --> 22:56.179
And I was supposed to consult
on a patient of his. Harmon Lake.

22:56.349 --> 22:59.845
Dr. Vucelich, I'm Susan Lewis,
and Harmon Lake is actually my patient.

23:00.016 --> 23:01.592
Excellent, Dr. Lewis.

23:01.766 --> 23:05.215
Then perhaps you'll let me show you
what's on this film.

23:08.685 --> 23:09.928
So...

23:11.434 --> 23:14.350
You can see here that the aneurysm
is clearly four centimeters.

23:14.519 --> 23:16.889
Which is borderline.
It should be treated medically.

23:17.061 --> 23:18.305
Dr. Vucelich.

23:18.478 --> 23:21.678
- You're Benton.
- I don't think we had a chance to meet.

23:21.853 --> 23:25.266
Why the hell did you cancel my consult
on Harmon Lake?

23:27.063 --> 23:29.432
Well, Dr. Lewis and I
looked at the arteriogram.

23:29.604 --> 23:31.844
It showed the aneurysm
to be at four centimeters.

23:32.021 --> 23:33.219
Yes?

23:33.397 --> 23:35.803
Which is within the limits
when you manage medically.

23:35.981 --> 23:37.853
I didn't want to waste your time.

23:38.023 --> 23:39.729
- Third-year resident?
- Yes.

23:39.897 --> 23:43.679
You better push those limits if you want
to remain invested in Surgery.

23:43.857 --> 23:46.560
Dr. Vucelich, I'm still responsible
for Mr. Lake.

23:46.733 --> 23:51.271
He should be admitted to ICU
and started on oral antihypertensives.

23:51.441 --> 23:56.147
I talked to Mr. Lake and he agreed
that surgery was a better option...

23:56.318 --> 23:59.730
...which relieves you
of your responsibility.

24:00.526 --> 24:04.058
Benton, you' re coming up.
It's time you learned something.

24:07.570 --> 24:10.935
- Should I come?
- John Carter.

24:11.111 --> 24:14.146
Fourth-year Surgical sub-I.
He's my student.

24:14.321 --> 24:16.525
Sure, why not? I like a crowd.

24:16.696 --> 24:20.062
- Well, here a croup, there a croup.
- Ross!

24:21.071 --> 24:22.897
Start her on a Vaponefrin nebulizer.

24:23.072 --> 24:26.189
What the hell do you think you're doing
admitting Joseph O'Connor...

24:26.365 --> 24:27.562
...when I asked you not to?

24:27.740 --> 24:30.442
- I feel he needed observation.
- I don't care what you feel!

24:30.615 --> 24:32.405
He's not at risk
for intracranial hemorrhage.

24:32.574 --> 24:34.067
We'll know in 24 hours.

24:34.241 --> 24:36.812
- I sent them home.
- You don't have the right to do that.

24:36.991 --> 24:39.444
I have every right.
I am the Chief of Pediatrics!

24:39.616 --> 24:42.899
He's my patient and I will take
responsibility for him, Bernstein.

24:43.075 --> 24:46.691
No, you won't. And I will no longer
take responsibility for you.

24:46.868 --> 24:49.570
You harass my clinic,
you harass my residents.

24:49.743 --> 24:51.533
You deliberately defy my orders.

24:51.702 --> 24:55.697
Now, your Pediatric fellowship is up
as of December 31 st.

24:55.870 --> 24:58.738
Well, let this serve as notice
you will not be renewed.

24:58.912 --> 25:00.867
You're out of here.

25:12.205 --> 25:15.406
- How long since we clamped him?
-59 minutes.

25:15.581 --> 25:18.414
I better hurry up, boys.
Under an hour and I got a new record.

25:18.582 --> 25:21.414
Now, Dr. Benton, do you know
why we're in a hurry?

25:21.582 --> 25:25.198
Prolonged lack of blood supply to
the spinal cord can lead to paraplegia.

25:25.375 --> 25:27.033
Is that where the Lazerol comes in?

25:27.208 --> 25:29.779
Mr. Carter, you've read
my research study.

25:30.000 --> 25:35.157
- On the 21-aminosteroids, yes.
- You can tell Dr. Benton all about it.

25:38.294 --> 25:40.960
I'm sure Dr. Benton already knows
all about it.

25:41.127 --> 25:44.328
We could always hear it again.
Repetition: big part of learning.

25:44.503 --> 25:48.545
Release the distal Statinsky
and backfill the graft. Mr. Carter?

25:48.712 --> 25:54.377
Lazerol helps prevent transverse
myelopathy from lack of oxygen...

25:54.546 --> 25:57.580
...as well as preventing edema
of the neurotissue post-op.

25:57.755 --> 26:02.911
- Assuming the drug is effective.
- Hopefully that's what my study will do.

26:04.256 --> 26:07.919
We have perfusion. Time?

26:08.091 --> 26:10.626
-60 minutes, 28 seconds.
- Damn.

26:10.799 --> 26:12.873
How do they come up
with these drug names?

26:13.049 --> 26:17.589
Some guy walking around New Jersey
going, "Prolixin, Zoloft, Lazerol"?

26:17.759 --> 26:19.915
Come on, I came up with that last one.

26:20.092 --> 26:23.091
- And a darn fine one it is, Carl.
- Thank you.

26:25.969 --> 26:28.256
Well, well, well...

26:31.636 --> 26:34.670
These two to Cardiology,
this one to Ortho.

26:34.845 --> 26:36.089
No problem.

26:36.262 --> 26:38.965
- Miss Hathaway.
- Mr. Zimble, how are you?

26:39.137 --> 26:42.420
You should not put this off forever.
I might have to leave.

26:42.596 --> 26:45.050
I haven't been putting it off.
We've been pretty busy.

26:45.222 --> 26:47.213
Perhaps you don't really
want this house.

26:47.389 --> 26:49.842
Of course I want this house.

26:51.431 --> 26:53.754
- Oh, dear, you need some help?
- Too late.

26:53.932 --> 26:56.421
Here, let me get that.

26:56.599 --> 27:00.427
- Stay put, Junior, I'll be right back.
- Oh, God.

27:02.641 --> 27:05.842
Me too. I'll be right back.

27:07.809 --> 27:09.716
I bet you're missing rehab
just about now.

27:09.892 --> 27:11.499
Been missing it since I got here.

27:11.568 --> 27:12.881
There's extra scrubs in the lounge.

27:12.966 --> 27:16.094
I've still got stuff in my locker upstairs.

27:16.269 --> 27:18.011
Hey, Doug. You okay?

27:18.186 --> 27:20.011
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Do you wanna talk?

27:20.186 --> 27:24.761
I'd love to, but I've got sniffles in 7
and bed-wetting in 6.

27:24.937 --> 27:27.936
- You got a second?
- Sorry, I'm on a break.

27:30.062 --> 27:32.137
Can we at least talk about this?

27:33.105 --> 27:35.938
Yeah, okay, sure, if you want.
If you need to.

27:36.106 --> 27:38.512
I'm sorry, John.

27:39.814 --> 27:42.978
It was an exceptionally bad day
and it just happened.

27:43.148 --> 27:46.266
- It's not going to happen again.
- You don't owe me an explanation.

27:46.441 --> 27:50.138
We only went out a few times.
Never even kissed.

27:50.983 --> 27:53.733
- Once.
- You know, you didn't have to tell me.

27:55.317 --> 27:58.435
- It's not that big of a deal.
- John.

27:58.610 --> 28:00.316
John, wait.

28:10.986 --> 28:14.602
Do you remember that little boy
with AIDS yesterday?

28:14.779 --> 28:18.608
He was so small and helpless.

28:18.780 --> 28:22.062
But I held him down,
listening to him cry...

28:22.238 --> 28:26.612
...squeezing out every last ounce of life
he might have had.

28:26.781 --> 28:31.106
It was the worst day of my life.
I didn't know where to go with that.

28:36.366 --> 28:38.737
Where I ended up...

28:43.450 --> 28:46.485
Where I needed to be...

28:46.660 --> 28:49.444
...was with somebody
who'd been through that with me.

28:52.827 --> 28:55.281
I hope you can understand that.

29:04.621 --> 29:08.450
Grand mal seizure in the mall,
lasting about two minutes.

29:08.622 --> 29:10.659
- Any ID?
- No, and no one with her.

29:10.830 --> 29:15.489
Normal saline IV TKO, two of Narcan
and an amp of glucose onboard.

29:15.665 --> 29:18.996
Let's move her on the count.
One, two, three.

29:19.165 --> 29:22.531
Vitals are stable. BP 100/70, pulse 110.

29:22.707 --> 29:25.872
Resps 18. On our arrival she was
comatose, GCS 5. I'm out of here.

29:26.041 --> 29:28.993
- Carpe diem.
- See you, Doris. CBC and Chem-7.

29:29.166 --> 29:31.537
- She has gingival hypertrophy.
- Dilantin level?

29:31.709 --> 29:34.494
- Yeah, she's probably epileptic.
- Babinski's downgoing.

29:34.668 --> 29:37.832
Pupils equal, round, reactive.
Corneal reflex normal.

29:38.002 --> 29:40.953
- DTRs 1-plus, equal bilaterally.
- Small occipital contusion.

29:41.127 --> 29:44.576
- You want a CT?
- No, let's see how she responds.

29:45.545 --> 29:47.002
Cross-table C-spine.

29:47.170 --> 29:49.658
We should check if the police
have any identification.

29:49.837 --> 29:52.160
I'll call Child and Family Services,
just in case.

29:52.337 --> 29:56.498
Lydia, why don't you clear out
Curtain Area 2? Put her in there.

29:56.672 --> 29:58.663
Busy day.

30:02.756 --> 30:04.830
Peter. Peter!

30:06.340 --> 30:08.248
Know that I didn't try
to come to County.

30:08.424 --> 30:11.173
I applied to practically every other
hospital in the county.

30:11.341 --> 30:13.462
This is the only ER rotation
that was open.

30:13.633 --> 30:16.667
- Okay. Fine.
- Peter, stop.

30:18.509 --> 30:20.914
You gonna be like this
the whole time I'm here?

30:21.092 --> 30:24.091
Can we at least pretend to be civil?
Professional?

30:26.844 --> 30:31.501
Okay, fine. I've got some post-op notes
to check on.

30:35.720 --> 30:39.335
- You're cutting him off, just like that?
- It's hardly "just like that. "

30:39.512 --> 30:42.843
We've been dealing with
this Ross situation since last summer.

30:43.013 --> 30:46.711
- He's a little bit more than a situation.
- Not to me.

30:46.889 --> 30:49.175
Ross runs roughshod all over that ER.

30:49.347 --> 30:52.014
He takes over the care of an outpatient.

30:52.181 --> 30:55.429
Never shows up to the Pedes Clinic,
where I can at least supervise him.

30:55.599 --> 30:58.301
- He's assigned to the ER.
- Where no one is supervising him.

30:58.474 --> 31:01.045
- That's not true.
- Pediatrics is not gonna pay for him...

31:01.224 --> 31:04.140
...so much as one day into the new year.

31:04.308 --> 31:08.848
You guys deal with his behavior.
He's off my service.

31:17.978 --> 31:20.051
- He's a good doctor.
- But he's a loose cannon.

31:20.227 --> 31:23.345
- Not sure I could handle him any better.
- He's a good doctor.

31:23.520 --> 31:26.851
- I know it's personal, and you're friends.
- I'll supervise him.

31:27.021 --> 31:30.552
His fellowship runs through December.
Gives him over a month to find a job.

31:30.729 --> 31:34.012
- We need him in the ER.
- We need a lot of things in the ER, Mark.

31:34.188 --> 31:37.685
But be realistic.
Have you looked at your budget?

31:38.356 --> 31:40.560
I'm due in surgery.

31:54.734 --> 31:58.100
- I got M&M in 10 minutes.
- This won't take that long.

32:01.610 --> 32:05.605
What you saw this morning was private.
No one should've seen it.

32:05.777 --> 32:07.852
Believe me, I wish I hadn't.

32:08.028 --> 32:11.607
But you did, and I'm concerned
with what that means.

32:13.820 --> 32:17.269
I know this is the '90s
and there are rules in medicine now.

32:17.446 --> 32:20.942
They exist to protect a medical student
from feeling they have to comply...

32:21.113 --> 32:23.567
...with the suggestions
of one of their supervisors.

32:23.739 --> 32:27.734
This wasn't a suggestion.
It was a choice, as much mine as his.

32:27.907 --> 32:31.354
But I don't want my career defined
by having gone to bed with someone.

32:31.532 --> 32:34.365
Especially since no one will care
about the reason.

32:34.532 --> 32:36.819
You don't care
about the reason, do you?

32:37.075 --> 32:41.816
No, I don't. My job demands
that I care about the ramifications.

32:42.325 --> 32:45.857
If this were to get out, it would more
than likely be misinterpreted...

32:46.034 --> 32:48.820
...affect my recommendations,
possibly even my internship.

32:48.994 --> 32:53.486
So I have no intention of discussing
this, either now or in the future.

32:54.703 --> 32:56.326
And I hope no one else will either.

33:10.622 --> 33:12.862
Will you scream at Radiology?
I need those films.

33:13.039 --> 33:15.658
Robert Potter Bradley. 10 years old.
Broken finger.

33:15.831 --> 33:17.822
Thank you, Jerry.

33:19.498 --> 33:22.497
There, there. You're okay.
Honey, just settle back down.

33:22.665 --> 33:24.870
- We're right here with you.
- What happened?

33:25.041 --> 33:29.995
She woke up agitated, disoriented,
trying to boot the side rails and...

33:30.167 --> 33:32.656
- Doesn't seem to like the IVs.
- Can't say I blame her.

33:32.834 --> 33:36.745
Can't say I do either. Who'd have
thought we'd ever agree on something?

33:36.918 --> 33:38.459
Her labs just came back.

33:38.627 --> 33:41.459
That's right. You're okay.
Just settle down.

33:41.669 --> 33:44.240
Just settle down.
We're gonna take care of you.

33:44.419 --> 33:48.497
We're gonna take care of you, honey.
You're all right.

33:48.671 --> 33:51.503
CBC and lytes are normal,
but her Dilantin level is only five.

33:51.670 --> 33:52.998
Sub-therapeutic.

33:53.171 --> 33:56.620
Epileptic seizure caused by her
not taking her medication.

33:56.797 --> 34:00.494
Let's give her Dilantin, seven mgs
per kilo at 50 mgs a minute IV.

34:00.672 --> 34:02.165
- Coming up.
- Okay.

34:02.339 --> 34:06.796
That's it. That's it. You're okay.

34:06.965 --> 34:10.829
- You could've gone into Pediatrics.
- Thank you.

34:12.424 --> 34:14.462
- I don't want a nurse.
- I'm not a nurse.

34:14.632 --> 34:17.335
- I want a doctor.
- I work with doctors. Now, move along.

34:17.509 --> 34:20.175
- You're a nurse?
- I'm a physician assistant.

34:20.342 --> 34:23.293
- Is that better than a nurse?
- It's just different.

34:23.467 --> 34:26.833
- I don't want a nurse.
- I'll examine you and take your history.

34:27.010 --> 34:28.800
Now, let's march. Come on.

34:31.177 --> 34:33.299
Is everything okay?

34:33.636 --> 34:37.003
- Is he a doctor?
- No, he's a nurse.

34:37.179 --> 34:38.886
Thanks, Malik. I got him.

34:52.098 --> 34:54.338
Mr. Preston. Gunshot wound
to the right shoulder.

34:54.514 --> 34:56.553
Distal pulses and sensation
in the right arm.

34:56.724 --> 34:59.840
BP 100/60, pulse 120. Resps 24.

35:00.015 --> 35:02.718
- And the wheelchair?
- Frank Davelle, nasty scalp lac.

35:02.891 --> 35:07.217
- I thought this was a double MVA.
- Let Mr. Davelle wait in the suture room.

35:07.392 --> 35:09.845
Harper! Get in here!

35:16.102 --> 35:18.389
All right, on three. Here we go, people.

35:18.561 --> 35:21.345
One, two, three.

35:24.187 --> 35:26.557
- How you doing there, Mr. Preston?
- Hell, he shot me!

35:26.729 --> 35:28.222
I can't believe he shot me!

35:28.396 --> 35:31.513
Shouldn't we order a CBC, type
and cross four units packed cells?

35:31.688 --> 35:33.513
Cross-table C-spine,
chest, shoulder x-rays?

35:33.730 --> 35:35.223
Yes again.

35:36.647 --> 35:39.847
- Does it hurt anywhere else?
- My neck. I'm gonna sue his ass.

35:40.022 --> 35:42.594
- That's very American of you.
- Yeah, yeah. What's that?

35:42.773 --> 35:45.262
- Your armpit.
- Fresh dressing.

35:45.441 --> 35:46.898
- Can you feel this?
- Yeah.

35:47.066 --> 35:49.352
Okay, squeeze my hand.

35:49.524 --> 35:51.681
Carter, why don't you and Harper
go next door?

35:51.858 --> 35:53.849
I can handle that on my own.

35:54.025 --> 35:55.732
Whatever.

35:56.859 --> 35:58.436
Excuse me.

36:00.109 --> 36:02.978
Harper, I need your help.
Why don't you help me logroll him?

36:25.031 --> 36:28.195
- Doug?
- Hey, Carol, what's going on?

36:28.365 --> 36:31.197
Nice try, but the film's upside-down.

36:35.574 --> 36:40.113
- Are you okay?
- Generally this has not been a good day.

36:40.283 --> 36:44.858
Specifically, this has not been
a good day.

36:45.034 --> 36:47.156
Although it felt so good
yelling at Bernstein.

36:47.326 --> 36:50.360
For about five minutes there
I felt completely liberated.

36:50.535 --> 36:56.154
- And now?
- And now, I've been here a few years.

36:56.328 --> 37:00.535
It's the longest commitment I've ever
made to anything or anybody.

37:03.079 --> 37:05.070
So...

37:05.246 --> 37:07.367
It's time to move on.

37:08.747 --> 37:11.116
Carol, Shep's on the phone.

37:12.330 --> 37:14.037
Speaking of moving on...

37:15.206 --> 37:19.153
- You call me if you wanna talk, okay?
- Okay. Okay.

37:31.167 --> 37:34.082
- The pool was your idea. You should ask.
- She'd kill me.

37:34.251 --> 37:37.582
- I think Wendy should ask her.
- Yeah, she'd never kill Wendy.

37:37.752 --> 37:40.038
- What?
- What is wrong with all of you?

37:40.210 --> 37:42.497
Can't put your mouth
where your money is?

37:42.669 --> 37:46.000
Hey, Randi, what did you do time for?

37:49.503 --> 37:54.078
Malicious mischief, assault, battery...

37:54.254 --> 37:56.376
...carrying a concealed weapon...

37:56.547 --> 37:59.498
...and aggravated mayhem.

38:01.339 --> 38:05.832
What? No, Shep, I'm telling you. No.

38:06.007 --> 38:09.171
Carol, quick, some guy
just crashed in 3.

38:10.382 --> 38:13.049
- Defib. Set up for intubation.
- Oh, my God!

38:13.216 --> 38:15.752
I was examining Mrs. Kerns
when this guy went south.

38:15.925 --> 38:18.461
- I can't believe this. My mobile notary.
- A what?

38:18.634 --> 38:22.047
- Notary. She's buying a house.
- He told me I shouldn't wait forever.

38:22.217 --> 38:26.461
- I'm a big procrastinator myself.
- Maybe he knew he was gonna die.

38:26.635 --> 38:29.550
He's not going to die.
Give him another amp of epi.

38:29.718 --> 38:33.844
God, we were so close. Two pages left.

38:34.011 --> 38:37.045
I need a 10-cc syringe.

38:37.221 --> 38:40.302
Get the paddles ready, 200. Carol?

38:40.470 --> 38:43.256
- Carol!
- These two!

38:45.638 --> 38:47.760
- Pulse ox?
-78.

38:47.931 --> 38:50.466
- How's the compliance?
- He's in the bag.

38:51.472 --> 38:54.009
- I can't believe I just did that.
- Neither could I.

38:56.349 --> 38:58.174
Oh, it's a good thing I did.

39:12.801 --> 39:14.211
Carter.

39:15.244 --> 39:17.335
Carter, I gotta talk to you.

39:20.844 --> 39:22.468
Carter.

39:25.854 --> 39:29.267
I didn't know about you and Harper.
All right? I'm sorry.

39:43.148 --> 39:45.021
Hey, hey, hey, nobody meant to-

39:47.441 --> 39:49.846
Nobody meant to hurt you, Carter.
Nobody-

39:51.191 --> 39:54.309
It happened because she was hurt.
It was a mistake.

39:54.484 --> 39:56.439
It was a mistake. You understand that?

39:56.609 --> 40:00.188
And if you were smart,
you little piece of-

40:00.359 --> 40:06.025
If you were smart, you'd give her
another chance and you'd listen to her.

40:07.028 --> 40:08.402
I have.

40:09.611 --> 40:11.519
And now I'm having to listen to you?

40:13.487 --> 40:16.320
I'm really happy that you both
have made your peace with this.

40:16.488 --> 40:21.359
But I'm gonna need a little more time,
if that's okay with everybody.

40:38.533 --> 40:42.574
- How is she doing?
- Pretty well. She's coming around.

40:48.702 --> 40:50.739
Are you deaf?

40:53.202 --> 40:58.193
Chuny, let's get these restraints off
and call for a sign language interpreter.

40:58.370 --> 41:00.775
- You know how to sign?
- Oh, poorly.

41:00.953 --> 41:03.075
You're going to be okay.

41:06.288 --> 41:11.159
Yes, you had a seizure,
but you're fine...

41:11.330 --> 41:12.871
Fine now.

41:13.039 --> 41:16.986
I want to call your family.
What's your name?

41:23.332 --> 41:25.904
Hi, Janie. I'm...

41:26.541 --> 41:27.786
Kerry.

41:32.084 --> 41:33.874
Okay.

41:36.293 --> 41:38.865
- If they're itchy, why don't you shave?
- You kidding?

41:39.044 --> 41:43.168
The Fire Department finally let us
grow this stuff. I can't give in yet.

41:43.336 --> 41:45.208
Okay, we're almost there, so don't look.

41:45.378 --> 41:47.369
I thought the point was for me to see it.

41:47.545 --> 41:50.709
- Okay, but don't look. Step up.
- I can't look. What?

41:52.796 --> 41:54.870
All right, we're almost there.

41:55.046 --> 41:56.456
Okay.

41:58.506 --> 41:59.879
Okay, now look.

42:03.506 --> 42:05.414
Isn't it incredible?

42:07.715 --> 42:10.120
- Yes, it is.
- I mean, I know it needs work.

42:10.298 --> 42:11.922
Yes, it does.

42:12.091 --> 42:16.085
I thought I'd paint it maybe gray
with a green trim, or yellow.

42:16.258 --> 42:19.210
And I know there's no stairs,
because they're in the back yard...

42:19.384 --> 42:21.090
...but I can just nail those back on.

42:21.259 --> 42:24.921
And also I can nail back on the shutters.
You should see the inside.

42:25.093 --> 42:27.713
Sorry.

42:27.886 --> 42:31.666
The bedroom is the biggest bedroom
I have ever had in my life.

42:31.844 --> 42:33.882
Which isn't saying a lot, but still.

42:35.137 --> 42:37.756
- What?
- You're beautiful when you're happy.

42:38.763 --> 42:41.381
I am. I'm happy. I'm happy. Come on.

42:41.554 --> 42:43.047
- Wait.
- What?

42:43.221 --> 42:46.635
I don't want you to worry
that I'm rushing into anything here.

42:46.805 --> 42:48.263
This is your first house...

42:48.431 --> 42:51.133
...and I think someone
should carry you over the threshold.

42:51.306 --> 42:53.712
- Okay, no.
- I knew you would agree.

42:53.890 --> 42:55.383
Put me down, you're gonna drop me.

42:55.557 --> 42:57.513
What are you talking about?
I'm a fireman.

42:57.682 --> 43:00.799
Oh, come on. Shep, put me down.

43:15.060 --> 43:18.391
Must have changed the schedule.
I missed mine by five minutes.

43:22.228 --> 43:23.934
So you didn't say anything
to Morgenstern?

43:24.103 --> 43:26.094
No, I didn't.

43:29.105 --> 43:32.055
Why are you doing this, Doug?
You're a good doctor.

43:33.105 --> 43:35.854
Bernstein doesn't agree.

43:37.231 --> 43:41.935
I looked at that kid's chart.
Joseph O'Connor.

43:42.106 --> 43:45.224
No signs of intracranial bleeding.

43:45.399 --> 43:47.604
You knew he didn't need
to get admitted.

43:47.774 --> 43:51.851
You're pushing Bernstein
the same way you've been pushing me.

43:54.567 --> 43:57.021
Why you doing this, Doug?

43:59.526 --> 44:01.067
I don't know.

44:04.527 --> 44:06.399
You'll miss your train.

44:07.305 --> 44:13.918
