WEBVTT

01:17.958 --> 01:18.916
Get changed.

02:03.750 --> 02:04.583
Martha?

02:05.541 --> 02:06.791
This can't be.

02:07.166 --> 02:08.000
You...

02:08.875 --> 02:09.875
You're alive.

02:19.583 --> 02:20.666
That isn't Martha.

02:32.833 --> 02:34.000
What's going on?

02:39.291 --> 02:40.500
He's right.

02:44.916 --> 02:46.333
I'm not Martha.

02:48.916 --> 02:50.208
Not your Martha.

02:53.166 --> 02:55.500
I promised to make everything right again,

02:56.958 --> 02:58.291
so none of it happens.

02:58.916 --> 03:01.875
So you don't die in my world,
and I don't die in yours.

03:03.958 --> 03:05.666
So that Ulrich... Dad...

03:06.125 --> 03:07.083
Mikkel...

03:08.000 --> 03:09.666
so they all come back.

03:10.166 --> 03:12.416
So everything finally comes to an end.

04:43.333 --> 04:47.916
THE SURVIVORS

04:51.125 --> 04:55.750
SEPTEMBER 22, 1987

05:57.791 --> 06:00.625
-<i>This is Ines...</i>
-<i>And Michael Kahnwald.</i>

06:00.708 --> 06:04.208
<i>We're not at home right now.</i>
<i>Leave a message after the beep.</i>

06:06.500 --> 06:09.541
<i>Mrs. Kahnwald, this is Mr. Dietmann</i>
<i>from the Federal Postal Service.</i>

06:10.041 --> 06:12.166
<i>I've been trying to reach you</i>
<i>for three months.</i>

06:12.666 --> 06:16.125
<i>We'll disconnect the line next month</i>
<i>if you don't pay the outstanding bills.</i>

06:16.958 --> 06:19.250
<i>Please call me back as soon as you can.</i>

06:19.333 --> 06:20.916
MISSING FOR THREE MONTHS

06:50.375 --> 06:52.375
I think you did the right thing.

06:54.541 --> 06:56.208
Even if the coffin is empty.

06:58.333 --> 07:00.666
To... to get closure.

07:04.208 --> 07:06.041
At least you've got each other.

07:07.208 --> 07:08.583
For support.

07:17.708 --> 07:19.500
At least we've got each other.

07:20.250 --> 07:22.416
Now we can stand hand in hand
by an empty coffin

07:22.500 --> 07:24.000
and finally get closure.

07:37.208 --> 07:39.958
Tell them where you were
when Mads disappeared.

07:46.916 --> 07:48.875
He was fucking her!

07:49.375 --> 07:53.375
When my son disappeared,
he was screwing Claudia Tiedemann.

08:01.083 --> 08:05.708
If only you'd put as much energy
into finding your own son

08:05.791 --> 08:08.458
as you're wasting
on finding your mistress...

08:09.208 --> 08:11.375
Then maybe Mads would be back by now.

08:13.750 --> 08:15.791
I have no idea what you're talking about.

08:34.500 --> 08:36.750
WHERE IS CLAUDIA TIEDEMANN?

08:37.208 --> 08:39.166
"I have no idea
what you're talking about."

08:52.416 --> 08:54.416
NUCLEAR POWER PLANT HEAD
MISSING SINCE JUNE 26,

08:54.500 --> 08:56.208
THE DAY HER FATHER
WAS FOUND DEAD AT HOME.

09:24.791 --> 09:30.416
SEPTEMBER 22, 2020

09:35.791 --> 09:38.583
<i>The world's scientists</i>
<i>are still seeking an explanation</i>

09:38.666 --> 09:42.166
<i>for the events of June 27, 2020.</i>

09:42.250 --> 09:44.916
<i>The epicenter of the global catastrophe</i>

09:45.000 --> 09:47.375
<i>is still thought to be</i>
<i>the small town of Winden.</i>

09:47.458 --> 09:49.583
<i>A French research team</i>
<i>believes it is possible</i>

09:49.666 --> 09:54.541
<i>that our world stood still</i>
<i>for a fraction of a nanosecond on June 27.</i>

09:54.625 --> 09:57.500
<i>Tidal forces may have diverged</i>
<i>as a result.</i>

09:57.583 --> 10:00.083
<i>This would explain</i>
<i>the global spring tides,</i>

10:00.166 --> 10:04.291
<i>weather phenomena,</i>
<i>and disturbances of electrical systems,</i>

10:04.375 --> 10:07.625
<i>which in turn could explain</i>
<i>the great number of airplane crashes</i>

10:07.708 --> 10:11.875
<i>and the simultaneous loss of power supply</i>
<i>to nuclear power plants worldwide.</i>

10:11.958 --> 10:14.375
<i>There is no sign</i>
<i>of the situation stabilizing--</i>

10:45.166 --> 10:46.291
How are you?

10:50.666 --> 10:51.750
Mom...

11:05.000 --> 11:06.791
You're leaving again already?

11:10.958 --> 11:13.166
I'll be back before the sun sets.

12:42.041 --> 12:44.500
In five days
all of this will be closed off.

12:49.708 --> 12:51.666
We're evacuating the entire area.

12:51.958 --> 12:54.416
We have orders to seal off
the restricted area.

12:56.125 --> 12:57.125
Seal off?

12:59.958 --> 13:00.791
Walled in.

13:10.791 --> 13:12.166
Why are you doing this to her?

13:49.958 --> 13:53.875
-You're from a parallel world?
-Where Mikkel doesn't disappear?

13:54.708 --> 13:55.833
I'm mute?

13:56.791 --> 13:58.458
And Jonas doesn't exist?

14:02.750 --> 14:06.375
Where we're all already dead
because your world ends just as ours does?

14:09.375 --> 14:10.583
That's bullshit.

14:12.125 --> 14:13.250
I'm not dead.

14:13.875 --> 14:14.833
I'm here.

14:24.958 --> 14:26.500
How did you find us?

14:29.708 --> 14:31.375
How did you know where we were?

14:33.166 --> 14:34.750
Jonas told me.

14:37.208 --> 14:39.708
I thought Jonas didn't exist
in your world.

14:47.125 --> 14:48.416
He traveled there.

14:50.375 --> 14:51.791
From your world to mine.

14:59.375 --> 15:00.541
You're lying.

15:02.250 --> 15:04.083
I was never in your world.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.708
Did you write the letter?

15:09.375 --> 15:10.791
What do you really want?

15:11.750 --> 15:12.833
Did Adam send you?

15:13.416 --> 15:16.166
What did you use to travel?
I want to know what you used to travel!

15:22.333 --> 15:24.875
You're running late today.

15:26.041 --> 15:28.166
The machines aren't running yet.

15:40.875 --> 15:42.250
You have a visitor.

16:04.583 --> 16:06.375
So you're the reason

16:06.916 --> 16:11.250
for his mood being
even worse today than usual.

16:15.416 --> 16:17.750
Don't let me scare you.

16:18.291 --> 16:19.958
People may say

16:20.041 --> 16:22.250
I'm not quite right in the head,

16:22.958 --> 16:24.708
but I assure you...

16:25.541 --> 16:27.625
that I see more

16:27.708 --> 16:30.500
than those among us who can see.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.750
-Do you know this boy?
-Nope.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.583
-Do you know this boy?
-No. Sorry.

16:45.666 --> 16:47.416
-Do you know this boy?
-No. I'm sorry.

16:48.875 --> 16:50.375
-Do you know this boy?
-Nope.

16:52.958 --> 16:53.916
Ulrich?

17:00.958 --> 17:02.000
Do I know you?

17:06.916 --> 17:09.041
Do you maybe know where this boy is?

17:11.250 --> 17:13.208
WHO HAS SEEN MICHAEL KAHNWALD?
12 YEARS OLD

17:13.875 --> 17:15.625
Maybe the madman got him after all.

17:17.875 --> 17:19.125
What madman?

17:19.208 --> 17:21.041
Don't touch me, Typhoid Mary!

17:22.333 --> 17:23.583
Hey, Ulrich.

17:24.625 --> 17:25.541
Ulrich?

17:27.500 --> 17:29.166
I thought you weren't coming today.

17:35.125 --> 17:36.083
Katharina.

17:37.166 --> 17:39.083
We'll be late for history class.

17:40.250 --> 17:41.708
Katharina Albers?

17:41.833 --> 17:42.750
Hello?

17:46.541 --> 17:48.000
I remember.

17:51.125 --> 17:52.291
What's with her?

17:56.166 --> 17:57.916
The old bat's not all there.

17:58.791 --> 17:59.625
Come on.

18:00.708 --> 18:01.583
Hey!

18:01.916 --> 18:02.791
Hey!

18:02.875 --> 18:03.958
What madman?

18:05.041 --> 18:06.500
What madman?

18:15.875 --> 18:18.208
A guy escaped
from the nuthouse this summer.

18:18.875 --> 18:21.083
He tried to drag Michael into the cave.

18:22.875 --> 18:24.541
It was in the paper.

18:25.750 --> 18:27.791
You keep your mitts off Mikkel!

18:28.166 --> 18:29.000
And Ulrich!

18:53.458 --> 18:56.041
VISITOR'S PASS - NIELSEN, TRONTE

19:08.458 --> 19:10.666
I've already told all this to the police.

19:11.458 --> 19:13.083
It won't take long.

19:14.875 --> 19:15.875
I promise.

19:19.166 --> 19:21.791
And this is supposed to be
for the newspaper?

19:25.666 --> 19:27.916
The week before Claudia disappeared...

19:31.333 --> 19:33.000
did you notice anything?

19:37.083 --> 19:39.291
Her appearance was always
very important to her.

19:39.833 --> 19:41.083
So neat.

19:41.875 --> 19:43.125
But that week...

19:44.541 --> 19:46.041
she wore outfits twice.

19:46.833 --> 19:49.291
She forgot appointments. Her hair...

19:51.125 --> 19:52.125
I think...

19:52.916 --> 19:55.666
it all had to do
with the old woman and the dog.

19:57.791 --> 20:00.875
She showed up a few days
before Mrs. Tiedemann disappeared.

20:00.958 --> 20:03.583
She said the dog belonged to her,

20:04.500 --> 20:06.083
but didn't take it with her.

20:07.666 --> 20:10.083
After that, Mrs. Tiedemann was somehow...

20:13.416 --> 20:14.416
different.

21:42.208 --> 21:43.250
Excuse me.

21:46.666 --> 21:47.875
We're looking for...

21:48.625 --> 21:49.833
a woman, late 40s.

21:50.125 --> 21:51.250
Blonde hair.

21:52.416 --> 21:54.375
And a girl. Seventeen years old. Red hair.

21:54.625 --> 21:56.500
If they're not on the wall, then...

21:57.166 --> 21:58.416
they're not here.

22:16.333 --> 22:18.625
This is good.

22:18.708 --> 22:24.541
If they're not here, then...

22:25.708 --> 22:28.500
Maybe they traveled.

22:37.208 --> 22:41.083
CALL FOR WITNESSES
WE ASK FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE

22:41.166 --> 22:44.708
MISSING
TIEDEMANN, CLAUDIA

22:47.000 --> 22:47.916
Hey!

22:49.583 --> 22:51.291
The man from the asylum.

22:53.083 --> 22:54.583
Why didn't you tell me?

22:54.666 --> 22:56.916
I thought I'd already made that clear.

22:57.916 --> 23:00.166
You can barge in here as often as you want

23:00.250 --> 23:03.416
demanding information
on the whereabouts of Michael Kahnwald.

23:03.500 --> 23:05.000
You won't get any.

23:05.083 --> 23:07.666
Someone tried to kidnap
my son this summer.

23:07.875 --> 23:08.791
Your son?

23:10.250 --> 23:12.333
You can neither identify yourself

23:12.416 --> 23:15.666
nor do you have any proof
you're actually the boy's mother.

23:15.750 --> 23:17.458
You're not registered anywhere.

23:17.916 --> 23:20.083
You don't have a birth certificate.

23:20.750 --> 23:23.958
And, astonishingly,
you don't even want to reveal your name.

23:24.041 --> 23:26.333
No one has seen him for three months.

23:27.083 --> 23:28.666
He doesn't go to school.

23:29.250 --> 23:30.583
He's not at home.

23:32.500 --> 23:34.291
The man from the psychiatric ward...

23:35.416 --> 23:36.750
I remember that.

23:37.666 --> 23:39.500
My mother told me about it.

23:40.041 --> 23:41.000
Maybe...

23:41.416 --> 23:43.208
Maybe he tried to do it again.

23:46.708 --> 23:48.291
Now listen very carefully.

23:49.541 --> 23:51.166
The boy hasn't disappeared.

23:51.375 --> 23:54.666
Child Protective Services know
where Ines and Michael Kahnwald are.

23:54.750 --> 23:58.416
After this summer's events it was decided
it was best to give the boy some time out.

23:59.250 --> 24:01.416
And the madman is back in the closed ward,

24:01.500 --> 24:03.708
as he has been for the past 34 years.

24:05.458 --> 24:07.000
What did you just say?

24:09.666 --> 24:11.416
Just to make it absolutely clear,

24:11.500 --> 24:14.750
if I see you here again,
I'm putting you in protective custody.

24:14.833 --> 24:16.666
-What's his name?
-Goodbye.

24:16.750 --> 24:18.083
What's the man's name?

25:05.666 --> 25:06.750
Hello, Regina.

25:14.416 --> 25:15.791
Is that your dog?

25:18.666 --> 25:20.208
It was my mother's.

25:25.958 --> 25:27.791
Should I give you a ride?

25:50.500 --> 25:51.541
Strange.

25:52.333 --> 25:53.791
Looks like Gretchen.

25:56.958 --> 25:59.000
I think that's why she kept her.

26:03.666 --> 26:04.833
Do you think...

26:06.083 --> 26:08.208
the disappearance of Mads and my mother...

26:09.250 --> 26:11.125
that they're connected?

26:14.416 --> 26:15.625
I don't know.

26:21.833 --> 26:24.333
The week
before she disappeared, did she...

26:25.125 --> 26:27.666
say anything to you about an old woman?

26:33.916 --> 26:34.750
And...

26:35.583 --> 26:38.708
did she say anything to you about me?

26:47.375 --> 26:48.208
I...

26:49.916 --> 26:52.958
just thought maybe she'd said something.

26:57.666 --> 26:58.583
I'll...

27:00.125 --> 27:01.666
get out just up ahead...

27:03.208 --> 27:04.750
and walk the rest of the way.

27:18.250 --> 27:19.083
Well...

27:22.083 --> 27:23.791
if you need anything...

28:17.000 --> 28:18.708
My name is Claudia Tiedemann.

28:18.791 --> 28:23.125
I am one of the few survivors
of the apocalypse of June 27, 2020.

28:24.041 --> 28:26.750
Almost three months have passed
since the catastrophe.

28:27.000 --> 28:30.875
It's still unclear
what exactly led to the events in Winden.

28:31.500 --> 28:33.000
But the God Particle...

28:33.083 --> 28:36.250
If we can stabilize it,
maybe it is a way back.

28:37.375 --> 28:38.958
Back to the past.

28:41.458 --> 28:42.833
Maybe we can save them.

28:44.166 --> 28:45.000
All of them.

29:31.833 --> 29:33.833
I'll take a look around upstairs.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.250
I'm looking for food.

30:31.208 --> 30:32.041
And you?

30:52.625 --> 30:54.791
MOM AND SISTER

30:57.875 --> 31:00.625
Where do you sleep?

31:14.125 --> 31:16.333
CAVE

31:18.916 --> 31:20.125
What's going on?

31:27.833 --> 31:29.125
Why are you here?

31:30.541 --> 31:31.500
Are you following us?

31:35.666 --> 31:37.875
I told you,
we want nothing to do with you.

31:41.625 --> 31:43.541
You want to protect her, I know.

31:46.750 --> 31:47.666
So do I.

31:50.791 --> 31:51.833
And I will.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.791
After you were killed.

32:09.916 --> 32:15.875
TANNHAUS
MACHINERY FACTORY

32:40.291 --> 32:41.500
I'm sorry.

32:43.500 --> 32:44.625
About Jonas.

32:46.333 --> 32:47.833
Since we've been here...

32:49.625 --> 32:50.458
he's...

32:54.083 --> 32:55.375
He's been different.

33:00.416 --> 33:01.916
How did you get here?

33:04.333 --> 33:05.500
We traveled.

33:07.916 --> 33:10.500
Exactly at the moment everything blew up.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.541
He didn't want to come here.

33:16.666 --> 33:18.250
It just happened.

33:20.875 --> 33:22.416
The device is empty.

33:24.791 --> 33:29.041
It's not that easy to get nuclear fuel
from the future in 1888.

33:36.291 --> 33:37.250
And this?

33:38.625 --> 33:39.541
What is this?

33:40.208 --> 33:41.250
The workshop?

33:42.041 --> 33:43.083
The blind man?

33:44.000 --> 33:45.500
Does he know who you are?

33:46.458 --> 33:47.833
Where you come from?

34:00.250 --> 34:01.083
Come along.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.500
I need to show you something.

34:12.958 --> 34:14.208
The young woman.

34:16.208 --> 34:17.791
Is she one of you?

34:19.625 --> 34:20.875
A traveler?

34:26.416 --> 34:29.333
When I found you, it was a sign.

34:30.166 --> 34:31.791
A godsend.

34:33.291 --> 34:36.000
Whatever that woman means to you,

34:36.083 --> 34:38.666
don't forget what we are going to create.

34:39.083 --> 34:40.583
Paradise.

34:42.291 --> 34:45.708
Every calamity can be reversed.

34:46.125 --> 34:50.500
Every pain,
destroyed before it even comes to be.

34:51.708 --> 34:54.000
A perfect world.

35:01.708 --> 35:03.500
<i>Sic mundus...</i>

35:03.916 --> 35:05.833
<i>creatus est.</i>

35:52.583 --> 35:53.500
Excuse me.

35:55.875 --> 35:57.083
Can I help you?

36:06.125 --> 36:07.458
Can I help you?

36:13.416 --> 36:14.625
I...

36:14.833 --> 36:15.708
I...

36:17.625 --> 36:19.208
I'd like to visit someone.

36:20.041 --> 36:22.041
He's been here for 34 years.

36:23.666 --> 36:25.041
The inspector?

36:27.708 --> 36:29.416
Do I know you from somewhere?

36:30.833 --> 36:32.583
Somehow you look familiar to me.

36:38.500 --> 36:39.875
Are you related to him?

36:45.791 --> 36:47.291
He's my husband.

36:49.666 --> 36:50.583
I see.

36:52.041 --> 36:53.375
You're one of them.

36:55.291 --> 36:57.625
One of those women
who go for madmen or prisoners

36:57.708 --> 36:59.541
because they can't find anyone else.

37:01.083 --> 37:03.041
I'm off duty. Come back tomorrow.

37:03.541 --> 37:05.333
That's St. Christopher.

37:08.250 --> 37:10.041
The patron saint of travelers.

37:14.375 --> 37:18.000
He renounced the devil
and carried the creator into the world.

37:19.583 --> 37:21.291
My mom had one just like that.

37:24.291 --> 37:26.625
I've traveled a very long way.

37:28.125 --> 37:29.833
Let me see him.

37:30.458 --> 37:31.291
Please.

37:42.500 --> 37:44.583
He was just released from solitary.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.791
My colleague will let you out.

38:34.750 --> 38:35.583
Ulrich.

38:45.333 --> 38:46.291
Katharina.

39:15.458 --> 39:17.166
I'll get you out of here.

39:19.375 --> 39:20.291
I promise.

40:00.583 --> 40:01.625
Excuse me?

40:05.333 --> 40:07.083
Excuse me, what are you doing here?

40:14.375 --> 40:15.375
What do you want?

40:17.625 --> 40:18.458
I...

40:19.000 --> 40:20.458
I'll call security.

40:22.041 --> 40:22.875
No.

40:23.666 --> 40:24.916
You won't do that.

40:34.416 --> 40:35.416
Jasmin.

40:36.541 --> 40:37.375
Right?

40:41.500 --> 40:42.583
Hell is empty.

40:44.958 --> 40:46.541
And all devils are here.

41:36.458 --> 41:38.416
At some point you have to decide.

41:39.583 --> 41:40.625
For us.

41:42.833 --> 41:44.083
Or against us.

41:49.250 --> 41:50.166
I...

41:53.125 --> 41:54.500
saw Regina.

41:56.833 --> 41:58.375
She's all grown up.

42:08.208 --> 42:10.375
I've wondered all these years...

42:11.625 --> 42:12.666
if she...

42:16.916 --> 42:19.291
Claudia never said who the father was.

42:27.791 --> 42:28.833
You're right.

42:30.750 --> 42:32.041
I have to decide.

43:14.083 --> 43:15.291
Mom?

43:34.958 --> 43:36.166
Tronte.

43:39.791 --> 43:40.791
Regina.

43:44.625 --> 43:46.250
What are you doing here?

43:47.750 --> 43:49.166
I'm so sorry.

43:49.541 --> 43:51.541
But it has to happen.

43:51.625 --> 43:53.083
I don't understand.

44:06.708 --> 44:08.333
She said...

44:08.416 --> 44:11.541
it's the only way to save you.

44:39.041 --> 44:41.291
MOM AND SISTER
CAVE

44:48.333 --> 44:50.541
What did he say to you?

44:52.000 --> 44:53.375
What do you mean?

44:54.041 --> 44:55.208
The boy.

44:59.000 --> 45:00.125
Forget him.

45:02.958 --> 45:05.125
I'm not a little kid anymore.

45:19.083 --> 45:21.916
Why do you carry that around
everywhere you go?

45:22.000 --> 45:23.666
What's in there?

45:23.750 --> 45:26.458
Where are Mom and Franziska?

46:00.458 --> 46:01.750
We'll find them.

46:18.666 --> 46:23.250
SEPTEMBER 22, 2053

47:33.125 --> 47:36.041
Everything will be okay.

48:18.291 --> 48:19.458
Clear the table.

48:29.125 --> 48:31.041
I said, clear the table.

48:33.791 --> 48:35.833
Must I always repeat myself?

51:55.708 --> 51:56.916
What is this?

51:58.000 --> 51:59.833
This is a kind of secret lodge.

52:01.541 --> 52:04.416
Old Tannhaus is the only member left.

52:07.166 --> 52:11.291
His father was convinced he could
override the rules of space and time.

52:12.875 --> 52:15.083
He dedicated his entire life to this.

52:17.125 --> 52:18.500
And so did his son.

52:21.958 --> 52:24.041
They tried to build a time machine?

52:28.708 --> 52:31.875
Jonas is trying to rebuild things
the way he saw them.

52:32.833 --> 52:34.166
He's been here before.

52:35.875 --> 52:36.833
Not now.

52:38.333 --> 52:39.416
In the future.

52:47.583 --> 52:49.416
He asked you something earlier.

52:50.833 --> 52:52.791
Whether Adam had sent you.

52:54.958 --> 52:55.958
He said...

52:57.250 --> 52:59.291
that Adam killed Martha.

53:00.791 --> 53:02.791
Who is this Adam?

53:05.333 --> 53:07.083
He didn't tell you guys?

53:12.125 --> 53:13.458
He is Adam.

53:15.666 --> 53:16.708
Jonas.

53:28.583 --> 53:30.333
We don't know our end.

53:33.833 --> 53:35.375
But our end...

53:36.875 --> 53:38.166
knows us.

53:39.541 --> 53:40.750
Salvation...

53:42.291 --> 53:43.750
or damnation.

53:46.500 --> 53:50.916
We can indulge in
the illusion of free will,

53:52.291 --> 53:56.916
but we cannot escape our ultimate destiny.

54:10.875 --> 54:13.958
The choices we make in this world
may be different...

54:16.333 --> 54:17.666
but nevertheless,

54:18.708 --> 54:21.125
they converge on the same moment.

54:24.083 --> 54:27.875
Things may not happen in the same way,

54:28.500 --> 54:30.041
or at the same time.

54:30.875 --> 54:32.291
But they happen.

54:35.041 --> 54:38.166
You believed a world without you
would be a better one.

54:42.958 --> 54:45.041
But they will all die.

54:47.000 --> 54:47.875
Mikkel.

54:49.916 --> 54:51.333
Mikkel will die.

54:52.625 --> 54:54.166
Everyone will die.

54:56.625 --> 55:00.041
The apocalypse takes place in my world

55:00.125 --> 55:02.000
just as it does in yours.

55:03.083 --> 55:05.541
But in mine, that's in just three days.
