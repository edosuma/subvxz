00:24.759 --> 00:27.494
Alia!

00:57.224 --> 00:58.660

Come on, Maddy, come on,
Maddy, come on.

02:21.408 --> 02:23.243
Come on.

02:23.276 --> 02:25.580
Come on, come on, come on,
Maddy.

02:28.315 --> 02:30.785
Well,
I'll put it into the computer system.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.587
Would you be able
to highlight it please

02:32.620 --> 02:33.487
as a um, simple say...

02:33.521 --> 02:34.488
Hey.

02:34.522 --> 02:36.289
Information there on that line.

02:36.323 --> 02:37.692
Um, all you need to do is...

02:37.725 --> 02:39.827
- Come on, come one.
- Thank you, have a good day.

02:39.861 --> 02:41.596
Next, please.

02:41.629 --> 02:42.597
It's uh,
it's really straightforward.

02:42.630 --> 02:43.397
Then what we'll do is

02:43.430 --> 02:45.332
I'll put that
into the computer.

02:45.365 --> 02:46.466
And you can

02:46.501 --> 02:47.702
Is there anything
else I can help you with?

02:47.735 --> 02:48.803
No, that's it.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.505
Next, please.

02:50.538 --> 02:50.938
Hello.

02:50.972 --> 02:51.371
Let me check.

02:51.405 --> 02:51.939
So...

02:51.973 --> 02:52.974
No, no, no, no, no, no.

02:57.244 --> 02:58.713
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

02:58.746 --> 03:00.515
Next, please!

03:01.149 --> 03:03.216
- And yeah, there you go.
- I appreciate it, thank you.

03:03.250 --> 03:05.887
Next, please!

03:05.920 --> 03:08.756
- You're next.
- Oh no, you go.

03:08.790 --> 03:09.757
You sure?

03:09.791 --> 03:11.526
Yeah, yeah, you know, I... I...
needed to back...

03:11.559 --> 03:13.628
- Thanks.
- Mmhmm, hmm.

03:13.661 --> 03:15.228
- Thank you for the help.
- Thank you so much.

03:15.262 --> 03:17.397
I'll see you soon, thank you.

03:21.869 --> 03:22.469
I mean how about this?

03:22.503 --> 03:23.771
What are the chances, huh?

03:23.805 --> 03:25.740
Yeah, that wasn't forced at all.

03:25.773 --> 03:26.541
No, not at all.

03:26.574 --> 03:27.842
No, it wasn't.

03:27.875 --> 03:28.810
It was like fate, too thick.

03:28.843 --> 03:30.578
Come on, well,
you look a little flattered.

03:30.611 --> 03:32.647
You always flatter me, Rex.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.448
Against my will, no less.

03:34.481 --> 03:35.482
Okay.

03:35.516 --> 03:36.450
Okay, I'll take that.

03:36.483 --> 03:38.351
Well, hey, picture this,
though.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.922
Maybe the whole evenin' of it.

03:40.955 --> 03:42.957
That flattery, I mean, not...

03:42.990 --> 03:44.892
Unless it goes that way, which...

03:44.926 --> 03:46.661
What can I do for you?

03:47.895 --> 03:48.796
Everybody,
down on the ground now!

03:48.830 --> 03:50.565
Everyone move where I can
fuckin' see you.

03:50.598 --> 03:51.398
Go, go, go!

03:51.431 --> 03:54.702
He said,
"On the fucking ground now!"

03:54.736 --> 03:57.270
Fuckin get down on the ground!

03:57.304 --> 03:59.372
Everyone, shut the fuck up!

03:59.406 --> 04:01.374
We gotta
make this short and sweet.

04:01.408 --> 04:02.777
So listen up your names.

04:02.810 --> 04:04.679
Olivia Beatty.

04:04.712 --> 04:06.480
Robert Bell.

04:06.514 --> 04:08.616
Madeline Augustine.

04:08.649 --> 04:09.917
And Angela Reynolds.

04:09.951 --> 04:12.987
All of you up
with your tills open.

04:13.020 --> 04:15.857
Ken King, I'm c... c-
coming for you

04:15.890 --> 04:18.358
and your c... c... c...
combination.

04:19.761 --> 04:21.863
Chop, chop motherfuckers.

04:28.803 --> 04:31.438
While he's doin' that,
all of you hold up your wallets,

04:31.471 --> 04:34.407
fucking billfolds, money clips,
take 'em out,

04:34.441 --> 04:36.511
and hold 'em above your head.

04:36.544 --> 04:37.712
I promise you'll be able

04:37.745 --> 04:41.616
to go about your business
very soon.

04:41.649 --> 04:43.618
And thank you
for your cooperation.

04:43.651 --> 04:45.987
Get the fuck out
from under there.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.027
Hands
where I can fuckin' see 'em.

04:53.060 --> 04:54.061
Now!

05:05.072 --> 05:06.641
Wallets up!

05:06.674 --> 05:10.945
Any resistance will be met
with a broken fuckin' face!

05:10.978 --> 05:12.847
Please,
please, I don't have any money,

05:12.880 --> 05:14.447
that's why I'm here.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.884
He says he ain't got anything!

05:16.918 --> 05:19.887
What did I just fuckin' say?

05:37.705 --> 05:41.474
And at that
moment, Mr. Coen decided

05:41.509 --> 05:42.977
that it was his place

05:43.010 --> 05:46.047
to put the lives of everyone
in that bank

05:46.080 --> 05:48.049
in further danger.

05:50.685 --> 05:53.054
And without hesitation,

05:53.087 --> 05:59.694
without any care or concern

05:59.727 --> 06:01.729
that's exactly what he did.

06:04.765 --> 06:06.033
Those poor souls.

06:08.135 --> 06:09.804
There's no
denyin' the heroic nature

06:09.837 --> 06:13.507
of Mr. Coen's intentions
and actions.

06:13.541 --> 06:14.542
No.

06:14.575 --> 06:16.611
No, no, no.

06:16.644 --> 06:19.013
No!

06:19.046 --> 06:20.815
Alright, everybody get up!

06:20.848 --> 06:22.617
Get out, I got this.

06:22.650 --> 06:24.685
He may have meant well...

06:24.719 --> 06:25.653
Stop, stop! Stop, stop...

06:25.686 --> 06:26.587
But this wasn't self-defense.

06:26.621 --> 06:28.556
Stop!

06:28.589 --> 06:29.991
Hold it right there.

06:30.024 --> 06:33.426
This was madness.

06:33.460 --> 06:36.463
The fact that he
caused an unnecessary death proves

06:36.496 --> 06:39.466
he's a danger to society.

06:39.499 --> 06:41.535
Rex,
this isn't gonna go your way,

06:41.569 --> 06:42.837
so the DA's offered a plea.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.071
I think you should consider it.

06:44.105 --> 06:45.072
What?

06:45.106 --> 06:46.941
No?

06:46.974 --> 06:49.577
Rex,
if the jury wants to make a statement,

06:49.610 --> 06:52.046
you can get 20 years
just for count 1.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.547
I was called a "hero"
three times,

06:53.581 --> 06:54.447
were you not listening?

06:54.481 --> 06:55.850
Put that up
against the innocent death

06:55.883 --> 06:57.051
they believe you caused.

06:57.084 --> 06:59.553
Okay, so what then?

06:59.587 --> 07:03.024
The DA's offered eight years.

07:03.057 --> 07:07.161
No parole, no
probation, you serve the term in full.

07:07.194 --> 07:11.165
Do your time,
you're free and clear.

07:11.198 --> 07:13.534
Keep walkin'!

07:13.567 --> 07:16.203
I am not gonna tell you again.

07:43.264 --> 07:45.967
I'm on a magazine?

07:46.000 --> 07:46.701
Here you go.

07:46.734 --> 07:48.135
Have a nice day.

07:56.744 --> 07:58.279
Did you find everything okay?

07:58.312 --> 07:59.647
Yeah.

08:10.091 --> 08:14.695
And uh, this, too.

08:18.966 --> 08:20.034
Fuck.

08:20.067 --> 08:24.171
Expired.

08:24.205 --> 08:27.041
Holy shit!

08:27.074 --> 08:28.075
What?

08:36.683 --> 08:37.751
Oh, heavens,
great, it's Rex Coen.

08:37.784 --> 08:39.153
- Hey, Rex. Rex!
- Hey, Rex.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.455
Hey, how does your
first day of freedom feel, man?

08:41.489 --> 08:43.224
You can say somethin'
about how you miss Boise?

08:43.256 --> 08:44.892
Looks like you gettin' some love
and some hate.

They're such pricks.

09:12.787 --> 09:14.722
What are they doing?

09:14.755 --> 09:16.090
Rex, do you have PTSD?

09:16.123 --> 09:18.159
How much do you think they get
for these, by the way,

09:18.192 --> 09:19.193
anyway, you know, like what?

09:19.226 --> 09:20.261
100 a pop?

09:23.064 --> 09:23.898
200?

09:23.931 --> 09:26.300
You gotta be at least worth 200,
right?

09:26.333 --> 09:28.135
We never got
the full story of the bank.

09:28.169 --> 09:30.004
You think you can give us
some a little insight?

09:30.037 --> 09:31.739
Have you
spoken with the girl, Maddy?

09:31.772 --> 09:33.641
Have you spoken with her
since you've been back?

09:33.674 --> 09:34.809
Don't do it.

09:35.843 --> 09:37.211
Hey, no, no, no, no,
no, hey.

09:39.947 --> 09:40.748
Don't do it.

09:40.781 --> 09:42.616
You still talk to her?

09:42.650 --> 09:45.119
Don't, don't do it.

09:53.094 --> 09:54.628
I saw that.

10:08.175 --> 10:12.146
Holy Mother of God.

10:12.179 --> 10:13.747
Whoa!

10:13.781 --> 10:15.749
Eight years,
and back from the d...

10:15.783 --> 10:17.651
What's with your hair up here?

10:17.685 --> 10:19.386
You're gonna be on the news.

10:19.420 --> 10:21.055
Sorry.

10:24.325 --> 10:27.094
Dude, that is fuckin' nuts!

10:27.128 --> 10:29.130
Hey, if that were a movie,
I still wouldn't believe it.

10:29.163 --> 10:32.733
I mean fucking Jason Bourne
over here!

10:32.766 --> 10:34.668
Holy shit!

10:34.702 --> 10:35.336
Hey, listen to me.

10:35.369 --> 10:36.871
You gotta write a book, man.

10:36.904 --> 10:38.272
Did you tell anybody else?

10:38.305 --> 10:40.307
Haven't been to see
anybody else.

10:41.308 --> 10:42.276
Oh, uh...

10:42.309 --> 10:43.244
Wait a minute.

10:43.277 --> 10:44.445
So nobody from the bank
has told that story?

10:44.478 --> 10:45.346
Well, no.

10:45.379 --> 10:47.047
I mean nobody had
your point of view.

10:47.081 --> 10:50.784
Mm, what about the girl?

11:01.228 --> 11:02.196
She came once.

11:02.229 --> 11:03.030
Once, wow!

11:03.063 --> 11:04.298
Huh, that's a bitch.

11:04.331 --> 11:05.299
I visited you more than that.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.201
Yeah, twice.

11:07.234 --> 11:08.302
Mmhmm.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.803
And no, you know what?

11:09.837 --> 11:11.038
She just... she found her life.

11:11.071 --> 11:15.309
That's all.

11:15.342 --> 11:16.443
Oh, you wanna go play a round?

11:16.477 --> 11:17.311
I ain't doin' nothin'.

11:17.344 --> 11:18.145
No, no, no, no.

11:18.179 --> 11:19.480
No, I'm not gonna play golf,
Pete.

11:19.514 --> 11:21.482
How was Shawshank anyway?

11:21.516 --> 11:23.217
Hmm?

11:23.250 --> 11:24.485
Did you uh...

11:25.119 --> 11:26.954
Get, you know?

11:26.987 --> 11:29.023
Uh...

11:29.056 --> 11:31.926
Hey dude, listen to me,
I don't judge...

11:31.959 --> 11:32.726
- Hmm.
- Alright?

11:32.760 --> 11:33.928
You gotta do
what you gotta do...

11:33.961 --> 11:34.962
Pete.

11:34.995 --> 11:35.829
- And it's a jungle in there.
- Pete, Pete.

11:35.863 --> 11:37.831
If you ever wanna talk
to somebody...

11:37.865 --> 11:40.768
Pete!

11:40.801 --> 11:41.969
Where's my shit?

11:46.273 --> 11:47.942
You know,
people are really acting

11:47.975 --> 11:49.009
like you're a celebrity

11:49.043 --> 11:51.245
ever since your release
re-sparked the old debate.

11:51.278 --> 11:52.346
Debate about what?

11:52.379 --> 11:54.415
About what you did, man.

11:54.448 --> 11:57.151
You know, some people think
you're a hero

11:57.184 --> 11:57.952
and others, well...

11:57.985 --> 12:00.387
Think I'm a psycho twat?

12:00.421 --> 12:02.756
Fuckin' psycho twat.

12:02.790 --> 12:04.992
Probably the cringiest
shit I've ever been called.

12:05.025 --> 12:06.126
I mean you're only getting that,

12:06.160 --> 12:07.828
because they don't know
what went on inside the bank.

12:07.861 --> 12:08.996
I just told you.

12:09.029 --> 12:10.864
Nah, the media really
buried that shit, man.

12:10.898 --> 12:13.867
All we saw was the trial
and that censored YouTube clip,

12:13.901 --> 12:15.970
which was badass, by the way.

12:16.003 --> 12:17.905
Well, maybe I should write
that fuckin' book.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.406
Yeah, I mean some versions
of the story,

12:19.440 --> 12:21.075
you're like the...
the Dark Knight,

12:21.108 --> 12:23.377
in others, you're the Joker.

12:23.410 --> 12:26.313
What do you think?

12:26.347 --> 12:28.415
Oh, I know.

12:28.449 --> 12:31.452
Yeah.

12:32.520 --> 12:34.922
Boom.

12:34.955 --> 12:36.957
So where to next?

12:36.991 --> 12:37.891
Finland.

12:37.925 --> 12:38.593
What?

12:38.627 --> 12:40.361
I kinda meant where to in Boise.

12:40.394 --> 12:41.929
Why Finland?

12:41.962 --> 12:45.366
Well, a very scientific,
very calculated reason.

12:45.399 --> 12:46.534
What's that?

12:50.904 --> 12:56.310
I shot a spitball at a map.

12:56.343 --> 12:57.512
Wait, that is
the stupidest fucking thing

12:57.545 --> 12:58.479
I've ever heard.

12:58.513 --> 12:59.947
Just ask Joe
for your job back here you know,

12:59.980 --> 13:00.781
for a start.

13:00.814 --> 13:02.416
You're not thinkin'
about going back

13:02.449 --> 13:05.219
to the military, though, right?

13:05.252 --> 13:08.455
You know, an all-new adventure
in a foreign land.

13:08.489 --> 13:12.393
No baggage, nobody knowing
who the fuck I am.

13:14.928 --> 13:16.463
It sounds like paradise.

13:19.601 --> 13:21.536
Help me!

13:21.569 --> 13:24.572
Help me, please!

13:25.640 --> 13:27.141
Help!

13:27.174 --> 13:29.310
Someone!

13:29.343 --> 13:31.345
Help me, please!

13:45.392 --> 13:47.461
No!

14:30.471 --> 14:33.407
Hey, it's you.

14:33.440 --> 14:34.509
It's you!

14:34.542 --> 14:35.510
It's you!

14:35.543 --> 14:36.511
It's me.

14:36.544 --> 14:39.012
Uh, that was a very great thing
you did, sir.

14:39.046 --> 14:39.913
Very great.

14:39.947 --> 14:40.715
Very brave.

14:40.749 --> 14:41.516
Uh, you would have
done the same.

14:41.549 --> 14:43.183
No, no, I wouldn't have.

14:52.493 --> 14:55.429
Takin' a vacation, Mr. Hero?

14:57.565 --> 14:59.366
Why you leaving, Mr. Wick?

14:59.400 --> 15:01.268
Mr. John Wick.

15:03.971 --> 15:05.573
You know,
they were speaking about you.

15:05.607 --> 15:07.542
Mr. Wick, hey, hero.

15:07.575 --> 15:09.943
That couple,
they were speaking about you.

15:09.977 --> 15:11.679
Oh, I'm sure they were.

15:11.713 --> 15:13.548
They said they want
to get you.

15:13.581 --> 15:15.550
- Hero, hey, hero.
- What?

15:15.583 --> 15:16.950
Wait, wait a minute,
they wanna get me.

15:16.984 --> 15:17.951
What does that mean?

15:17.985 --> 15:18.952
I don't know.

15:18.986 --> 15:21.488
They said they were planning
on getting you.

15:21.523 --> 15:22.356
Hey, hey, hey.

15:22.389 --> 15:25.058
Said you looked perfect
for their son.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.393
Whatever that means.

15:26.427 --> 15:28.162
When you were in that
bank, how did you know exactly

15:28.195 --> 15:29.029
what you were gonna do?

15:29.062 --> 15:30.030
That's funny.

15:30.063 --> 15:30.799
It's funny, it's a joke.

15:30.832 --> 15:31.666
Probably.

15:31.699 --> 15:32.767
Yeah.

15:32.801 --> 15:36.738
"Black humor", I think,
you Americans would call it.

15:36.771 --> 15:37.971
Right.

15:38.005 --> 15:43.076
You know, lots have gone missing
in Helsinki over the years.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.378
So what's in Finland?

15:44.411 --> 15:45.446
Lots.

15:45.479 --> 15:47.414
You got some bad guys
to fight over there, too?

15:47.448 --> 15:48.616
You be careful.

15:48.650 --> 15:50.083
Hey,
if you ever come to my home country,

15:50.117 --> 15:53.420
you and I... wait, hey.

15:53.454 --> 15:54.556
Freaked out?

15:55.723 --> 15:56.558
Okay.

15:56.591 --> 15:57.357
Yeah, well, hey,
good luck to 'em, right?

15:57.391 --> 15:58.225
- You, too.
- That's right.

15:58.258 --> 16:01.195
No one messes
with Captain America!

16:09.637 --> 16:12.306
You could take 'em.

16:12.339 --> 16:14.341
You won't have to,
but you could.

16:17.110 --> 16:19.313
They're just another couple
of crazy fans.

16:19.346 --> 16:22.015
They don't wanna "get" you.

16:22.049 --> 16:26.019
What does that even mean?

16:26.053 --> 16:28.656
It was a pretty creepy smile,
though.

16:38.065 --> 16:40.635
Oh my God!

16:40.668 --> 16:42.804
He definitely wants to get you!

16:45.439 --> 16:47.441
Chuck your dick away, quick.

16:55.415 --> 16:56.718
This is
the pre-boarding announcement.

16:56.751 --> 16:58.753
Flight LS107 to Helsinki.

16:58.786 --> 17:00.588
We are now inviting
those passengers

17:00.622 --> 17:01.623
with small children

17:01.656 --> 17:03.257
and any passenger requiring
special assistance

17:03.290 --> 17:04.659
to board at this time.

17:04.692 --> 17:08.060
"Boi to hel."

17:08.095 --> 17:09.597
Uh, fuck me, right?

18:03.350 --> 18:05.118
Taxi.

18:29.510 --> 18:30.878
Hey.

19:00.273 --> 19:04.277
Hey, excuse me, what is that?

19:06.313 --> 19:07.481
Hey!

19:07.515 --> 19:08.583
Hey!

19:08.616 --> 19:09.884
Hey!

19:09.917 --> 19:11.919
Hey,
what the fuck are you doing?

19:11.953 --> 19:12.887
Hey!

19:13.821 --> 19:16.591
Hey!

19:18.258 --> 19:21.395
Hey, what the fuck!

19:21.428 --> 19:23.230
What the fuck are you doing?

19:50.457 --> 19:53.828
"Fee, Fye, Fo, Fum.

19:53.861 --> 19:56.831
I smell the blood
of an American.

19:56.864 --> 19:59.967
Be he alive or be he dead.

20:00.001 --> 20:03.571
I'll grind his bones
to make my bread."

20:03.604 --> 20:06.974
"'Nonsense, dear',
said his wife.

20:07.008 --> 20:08.943
'You're dreaming
or perhaps you smell the scraps

20:08.976 --> 20:10.645
of that little boy
you liked so much

20:10.678 --> 20:12.647
for yesterday's banquet.'"

20:12.680 --> 20:14.649
Banquet?

20:19.286 --> 20:20.387
Banquet.

20:20.420 --> 20:21.923
Good.

20:21.956 --> 20:24.559
"So off the ogre went,

20:24.592 --> 20:27.461
and Jack was just
going to jump out of the oven,

20:27.494 --> 20:30.565
and run away
when the woman pulled him."

21:06.033 --> 21:08.435
"At last, his head began to nod

21:08.468 --> 21:10.071
and he began to snore

21:10.104 --> 21:15.042
until the whole house
shook again.

21:18.478 --> 21:21.448
"The princess ran downstairs
to meet her charming prince."

21:27.655 --> 21:28.623
Okay, okay.

21:28.656 --> 21:29.657
So

24:05.146 --> 24:08.716
Don't let them hear you.

24:50.157 --> 24:52.059
How?

24:52.093 --> 24:54.028
I don't know.

24:54.061 --> 24:56.063
It's impossible.

24:56.097 --> 24:59.133
Obviously not.

24:59.166 --> 25:00.534
No.

25:00.568 --> 25:02.036
No, no, it's not possible.

25:02.069 --> 25:04.238
Obviously.

25:04.271 --> 25:05.740
Obviously not

25:05.773 --> 25:10.745
and don't let them
fuckin' hear you!

25:10.778 --> 25:13.748
Them?

25:13.781 --> 25:14.181
Them?

25:14.215 --> 25:17.752
Who's them?

25:17.785 --> 25:19.253
No.

25:19.286 --> 25:20.588
Not not them.

25:20.621 --> 25:20.988
No.

25:21.022 --> 25:22.690
The airport?

25:22.723 --> 25:23.758
The creepy couple?

25:23.791 --> 25:24.759
Is that what this is?

25:24.792 --> 25:26.761
Or the most fucked up
coincidence in history.

25:26.794 --> 25:28.129
And keep your voice down.

25:29.130 --> 25:30.865
How?

25:30.898 --> 25:33.901
How?

25:42.209 --> 25:43.778
They got you.

25:44.812 --> 25:45.713
How?

25:45.746 --> 25:46.580
How?

25:46.614 --> 25:47.915
How?

25:47.948 --> 25:48.849
How come?

25:48.883 --> 25:51.585
I have no fucking idea!

25:51.619 --> 25:53.854
I have no idea!

25:53.888 --> 25:54.989
Let me ask you something.

25:55.022 --> 25:56.857
Why'd you pick Finland, huh?

25:56.891 --> 25:59.160
Of all the fuckin' places
on the planet why Finland?

25:59.193 --> 26:01.862
Why did you choose
fucking Finland?

26:01.896 --> 26:04.165
Fuck!

26:04.198 --> 26:06.967
Fuck!

26:09.737 --> 26:10.704
How?

26:12.373 --> 26:14.008
Okay, you know what?

26:14.041 --> 26:16.043
If you're gonna insist
on asking that question,

26:16.077 --> 26:18.913
I suggest you apply it
to figuring out how

26:18.946 --> 26:21.048
to undo those knots
and get the fuck out of here,

26:21.082 --> 26:22.917
because guess what, pal?

26:22.950 --> 26:26.620
Hey, you're here
and it doesn't matter how.

26:26.654 --> 26:27.922
It doesn't matter why.

26:27.955 --> 26:32.126
You are here!

26:32.159 --> 26:33.327
Welcome to paradise.

26:42.369 --> 26:43.304
Okay, okay.

26:43.337 --> 26:46.173
What do we know
and what do we need to know?

26:46.207 --> 26:48.175
My leg's missing.

26:48.209 --> 26:50.711
It's quiet and it's dark.

26:50.744 --> 26:53.280
It's gotta be about the middle
of the night, I guess.

26:53.314 --> 26:55.950
I don't know.

26:55.983 --> 26:58.853
We need to know
how much time we have.

26:58.886 --> 27:00.154
If you can't undo those knots
by dawn,

27:00.187 --> 27:03.090
it's gonna be big trouble
in little Finland.

27:05.226 --> 27:06.193
Now, we know

27:06.227 --> 27:09.096
this ain't even close
to their first rodeo.

27:09.130 --> 27:12.133
What we need to know

27:14.001 --> 27:16.103
is there anything useful
in those bags?

27:19.039 --> 27:20.875
Now, that looks like
polyester staple rope

27:20.908 --> 27:23.277
tied up in triple knots.

27:23.310 --> 27:27.314
If you can't tie knots,
tie lots.

27:27.348 --> 27:29.717
Yeah, we know they have
confidence in that rope,

27:29.750 --> 27:32.086
because your mouth ain't gagged
and your leg's swinging free.

27:32.119 --> 27:35.422
Either that or they know
it'll take more time

27:35.456 --> 27:38.292
than you have.

27:38.325 --> 27:41.395
Or I'm not supposed to be awake.

27:41.428 --> 27:46.433
Five years ago, Dr. Orso,
I woke up durin' the root canal.

27:48.469 --> 27:49.303
Let's play it safe

27:49.336 --> 27:50.804
and say it's about 4:00
in the morning.

27:50.838 --> 27:51.939
I hope it's 1:00.

27:51.972 --> 27:53.941
Well, heck, I hope it's fuckin'
ABC fuckin' Prime Time

27:53.974 --> 27:54.875
up in this bitch,

27:54.909 --> 27:56.043
but let's play it safe
and say it's 4:00.

27:56.076 --> 27:59.079
so you bein' awake gives us
a considerable advantage.

27:59.113 --> 28:03.050
I'm a cripple.

28:03.083 --> 28:07.421
Yeah, let's talk about that.

28:07.454 --> 28:10.024
Why aren't you dead?

28:10.057 --> 28:12.126
You should be.

28:12.159 --> 28:15.029
They
prevented you from bleeding out.

28:15.062 --> 28:16.463
Why?

28:16.497 --> 28:19.233
And why your leg, huh?

28:19.266 --> 28:21.335
They can't possibly be
medical professionals,

28:21.368 --> 28:23.437
judging by the look
of this pathetic hack job,

28:23.470 --> 28:25.739
but I don't know.

28:25.773 --> 28:27.975
Black market human limb trade,
is that a thing?

28:28.008 --> 28:28.842
I'm pretty sure in Serbia...

28:28.876 --> 28:32.246
Can we go back
to me not dying, please?

28:32.279 --> 28:33.047
Right.

28:33.080 --> 28:33.914
Right, right, right,
yeah, okay.

28:33.948 --> 28:39.320
So a dead Rex
would be a useless Rex.

28:40.788 --> 28:43.157
Apparently.

28:43.190 --> 28:49.496
So they're keeping you alive
to keep your parts from rotting!

28:49.531 --> 28:50.764
I don't know.

28:50.798 --> 28:53.334
I mean I guess that makes sense
for the uh, organ trade deal,

28:53.367 --> 28:55.503
but you've still got
your kidneys, your lungs,

28:55.537 --> 28:56.504
your heart.

28:56.538 --> 28:59.907
What good is just one leg?

29:18.259 --> 29:20.227
It's a fuckin' family.

29:40.147 --> 29:42.049
- Let's get out of here.
- Yeah.

29:42.082 --> 29:43.551
You think
you can gnaw that shit off?

29:44.251 --> 29:46.521
Come on, teeth.

29:51.859 --> 29:54.328
Hey, I'm lighter

29:57.464 --> 29:58.299
Okay.

29:58.332 --> 29:59.033
You see?

29:59.066 --> 30:01.435
Hey, hey!

30:01.468 --> 30:03.137
Not the time.

30:03.170 --> 30:04.038
Alright.

30:22.389 --> 30:24.158
Good night.

31:27.454 --> 31:28.455
It's fiber.

31:30.525 --> 31:32.059
Come on, come on!

31:32.092 --> 31:36.363
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait!

31:36.397 --> 31:37.131
What is it?

31:37.164 --> 31:38.232
What?

31:38.265 --> 31:40.000
Answers.

31:44.672 --> 31:46.206
Here it comes.

31:55.583 --> 31:58.085
That's 2:00 a.m.

32:00.688 --> 32:01.689
Hoo-hoo!

32:01.723 --> 32:03.257
Let's go hard,
can you show me what you got?

32:03.290 --> 32:05.092
Let's go.

32:13.701 --> 32:14.569
Fuck!

32:14.602 --> 32:16.571
Fuck is that?

32:16.604 --> 32:18.305
Oh, fuck!

32:19.641 --> 32:20.174
Okay, maybe...

32:20.207 --> 32:24.478
We need a backup plan.

32:24.512 --> 32:26.079
How did that dude get away
from the crazy bitch

32:26.113 --> 32:27.414
in that movie Misery?

32:27.448 --> 32:30.484
Uh, he uh...

32:30.518 --> 32:32.986
He used the story
he was writing

32:33.020 --> 32:35.088
as his insurance policy.

32:35.122 --> 32:36.089
Wow.

32:36.123 --> 32:38.593
As long as he had it,
she couldn't kill him.

32:38.626 --> 32:40.327
She needed it.

32:40.360 --> 32:43.464
He used it as leverage,
and then he destroyed it,

32:43.497 --> 32:45.332
and bashed her head in
with a typewriter.

32:45.365 --> 32:47.201
Yeah, we need
an insurance policy.

32:47.234 --> 32:48.302
And a typewriter.

32:48.335 --> 32:49.504
Man.

32:53.741 --> 32:54.441
Asleep!

32:54.475 --> 32:54.876
Asleep!

32:54.909 --> 32:55.643
You're asleep!

32:59.046 --> 33:01.248
Is this it?

33:01.281 --> 33:02.149
Oh, shit!

33:02.182 --> 33:04.017
Is this it?

33:04.051 --> 33:05.319
I have nothing!

33:05.352 --> 33:06.420
Fuck!

33:06.453 --> 33:07.120
Fuck it!

33:07.154 --> 33:07.555
Fuck it all!

33:07.589 --> 33:08.255
I have nothing!

33:08.288 --> 33:09.056
Oh, this is no good at all!

33:09.089 --> 33:10.457
I have nothing!

33:12.493 --> 33:14.596
Is it them?

33:15.763 --> 33:16.664
They're just looking.

33:16.698 --> 33:18.432
It's okay,
I think they're only looking.

33:18.465 --> 33:20.768
It's okay, it's okay.

33:27.575 --> 33:29.644
It's a boy.

33:35.750 --> 33:41.188
That's just a little boy.

33:41.221 --> 33:46.460
As if this shit
couldn't get me creepier!

33:46.493 --> 33:50.397
Well, here's the good news.

33:50.430 --> 33:53.100
Here's our insurance policy.

34:09.116 --> 34:11.083
Hey, you know,
what would be funny is if you tore

34:11.118 --> 34:12.587
this little asshole's leg off,

34:12.620 --> 34:14.755
and then stuck it to yourself,

34:14.789 --> 34:18.257
and then walked upstairs
as if nothing was wrong.

34:41.583 --> 34:44.418
Banquet.

34:46.286 --> 34:48.523
What the fuck?

34:48.556 --> 34:49.255
Stop him!

34:49.289 --> 34:49.857
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, um...

34:49.891 --> 34:53.761
Stop!

34:53.795 --> 34:55.830
Spanish, really?

34:55.862 --> 34:57.264
I don't know.

34:57.297 --> 34:57.665
Whatever.

34:57.699 --> 34:58.298
Reel him in.

34:58.332 --> 34:59.701
Slowly.

34:59.734 --> 35:01.736
Hey, hey.

35:01.769 --> 35:03.337
Kid.

35:03.370 --> 35:04.471
Come here.

35:09.276 --> 35:12.145
Yeah, yeah,
come here, come here.

35:12.179 --> 35:13.246
God, I wish I knew some Finnish.

35:13.280 --> 35:14.549
Come, you come.

35:14.582 --> 35:17.351
You.

35:18.285 --> 35:22.155
You think he speaks English?

35:22.189 --> 35:26.861
Do you speak English?

35:26.894 --> 35:30.464
You do?

35:30.497 --> 35:31.899
I'm not gonna hurt you.

35:31.933 --> 35:34.468
Oh, but he is so gonna hurt you.

35:41.408 --> 35:43.477
Huh, look at that, you got him.

35:46.313 --> 35:48.616
It's okay, don't be scared.

35:48.650 --> 35:51.953
I just wanna know your name.

35:51.986 --> 35:56.591
And to use you
as delicious bait.

35:56.624 --> 36:00.494
Olavi.

36:00.528 --> 36:04.297
What's your name?

36:04.331 --> 36:05.633
Ola...

36:16.611 --> 36:17.812
Holy shit!

36:17.845 --> 36:19.981
Holy shit!

36:20.014 --> 36:22.717
Holy fucking shit, man!

36:23.885 --> 36:25.452
Whoo!

36:25.920 --> 36:31.491
Olavi?

36:31.526 --> 36:32.827
Now, what do we do?

36:37.865 --> 36:39.801
Hold tight.

37:08.563 --> 37:09.697
Olavi.

37:09.731 --> 37:10.598
His name's Olavi?

37:13.735 --> 37:16.369
I thought he was saying "hola".

37:16.403 --> 37:19.406
He reacted when I spoke to him
in Spanish.

37:22.610 --> 37:23.477
Quiet.

37:23.511 --> 37:25.012
Please.

37:25.046 --> 37:27.582
I know that feeling, trust me.

37:29.917 --> 37:36.389
Do you speak English?

37:36.423 --> 37:42.597
I'm not gonna hurt you or him.

37:42.630 --> 37:44.732
Again.

37:45.499 --> 37:47.367
Do you speak English?

37:47.969 --> 37:52.707
Do you speak English?

37:52.740 --> 37:54.041
You do, you do.

37:54.075 --> 37:56.043
Great, okay.

37:56.077 --> 37:57.545
He's not dead.

37:57.578 --> 37:58.646
I can feel his pulse.

37:58.679 --> 37:59.747
I might have broken his nose,
though.

37:59.781 --> 38:00.313
I'm sorry about that.

38:00.347 --> 38:03.751
I felt like I had to.

38:03.785 --> 38:05.520
My name is Rex.

38:05.553 --> 38:07.420
Pleasure is all mine.

38:07.454 --> 38:14.729
I'd offer you my hand, but well,
you'd probably keep it.

38:14.762 --> 38:16.631
I'm kidding, that's a joke.

38:16.664 --> 38:17.632
Um, well, not really.

38:17.665 --> 38:18.398
Kinda.

38:18.431 --> 38:20.067
What's your name?

38:22.069 --> 38:22.435
Uh, no.

38:22.469 --> 38:23.538
No, no, no.

38:23.571 --> 38:24.539
Hey, hey, here we go.

38:24.572 --> 38:25.338
Back up here.

38:25.372 --> 38:28.943
Hey,
before you do anything rash,

38:28.976 --> 38:34.715
know that all I have to do
is squeeze.

38:34.749 --> 38:37.384
So you and I are gonna make
a little deal

38:37.417 --> 38:41.354
with each other, okay?

38:41.388 --> 38:45.660
If you let me go,
I'll let him go.

38:45.693 --> 38:46.694
Alright?

38:46.727 --> 38:49.764
In fact, I'm gonna make it
even easier for you.

38:49.797 --> 38:52.700
All you gotta do is
give me that knife right there

38:52.733 --> 38:53.968
and I'll release him.

38:54.001 --> 38:54.969
That's all.

38:55.002 --> 38:57.470
It's all you have to do.

38:57.505 --> 38:59.339
What do you say?

39:03.443 --> 39:04.812
Damn!

39:04.846 --> 39:09.750
What a sexy little psychopath,
huh?

39:09.784 --> 39:10.450
What's she doin'?

39:10.483 --> 39:13.120
She gonna help you or kill you?

39:13.154 --> 39:15.723
Help you or kill you?

39:15.756 --> 39:17.091
Hey, is she gonna help you
or kill you?

39:17.124 --> 39:19.126
I don't know!

39:19.359 --> 39:20.995
You don't know what?

39:21.028 --> 39:23.097
Oh, fuck.

39:23.130 --> 39:23.396
Fuck.

39:23.430 --> 39:24.899
Fuck!

39:30.137 --> 39:33.608
So do we have a deal?

39:33.641 --> 39:34.407
Knife, knife.

39:34.441 --> 39:35.643
Get the knife!

39:43.985 --> 39:46.419
Hey, no, come on.

39:46.453 --> 39:48.689
You don't wanna do this.

39:48.723 --> 39:49.724
You don't wanna to do this.

39:49.757 --> 39:52.994
Look at me, look at me!

39:53.027 --> 39:56.463
You're not like them.

39:56.496 --> 39:58.799
Are you?

40:07.909 --> 40:09.043
Are you?

40:17.585 --> 40:19.587
Well done, fuckhead!

40:19.620 --> 40:20.888
We have to get out of
here now!

40:32.499 --> 40:33.067
Ollie.

40:42.910 --> 40:44.679
Ollie!

41:54.782 --> 41:56.584
Did they all just leave?

42:53.240 --> 42:59.013
Oh.

43:26.807 --> 43:28.742
That Finnish chick, though.

43:30.311 --> 43:30.945
What?

43:30.978 --> 43:31.378
What?

43:31.412 --> 43:31.779
She was sexy.

43:31.812 --> 43:33.380
You saw her.

43:33.414 --> 43:34.448
She's a murderer.

43:34.482 --> 43:36.050
Yeah, I'm not convinced, though.

43:36.083 --> 43:36.851
She was covering her eyes.

43:36.884 --> 43:38.752
Why would she be
covering her eyes?

43:39.787 --> 43:42.890
Now is not the time to play...

43:43.924 --> 43:46.894
Psychotherapist
to the fuckin' Manson Family.

43:46.927 --> 43:48.162
I'm not saying we do that.

43:48.195 --> 43:49.363
I'm just saying
I'm not convinced

43:49.396 --> 43:50.364
that she was a murderer.

43:50.397 --> 43:51.165
That's all.

43:51.198 --> 43:53.200
Well, you've been wrong
before, so

43:53.234 --> 43:53.734
What?

43:53.767 --> 43:54.401
When?

43:54.435 --> 43:55.269
Oh, I don't know.

43:55.302 --> 43:56.804
Uh, "They're just fans.

43:56.837 --> 43:57.738
They don't wanna get you.

43:57.771 --> 43:59.106
What does that even mean?"

43:59.140 --> 43:59.874
Huh?

43:59.907 --> 44:00.407
That's you!

44:00.441 --> 44:02.176
Oh, give me a break.

44:02.209 --> 44:04.145
You...

44:04.178 --> 44:05.446
Yes, I did!

44:05.479 --> 44:06.413
Okay.

44:07.748 --> 44:10.317
Yes, I did.

44:10.351 --> 44:12.920
Well, yeah, okay of course,
if the opportunity arises,

44:12.953 --> 44:13.888
we will do that.

44:13.921 --> 44:18.826
That's not what I'm arguin'
and fuck this!

44:25.232 --> 44:29.303
How'd they take it?

44:29.336 --> 44:31.338
Not too well, I'm guessing.

44:34.041 --> 44:35.809
Where'd they take him?

44:35.843 --> 44:38.012
The hospital, yeah?

44:39.346 --> 44:42.383
Did they all leave?

44:42.416 --> 44:44.818
What'd you tell 'em?

44:44.852 --> 44:47.121
Hey, why am I still alive?

44:47.154 --> 44:49.323
Unless you're here...
wait, wait, what is that?

44:49.356 --> 44:50.257
What is that?

44:50.291 --> 44:51.258
A butcher Barbie play set?

44:51.292 --> 44:52.860
Another joke.

44:52.893 --> 44:54.328
What?

44:54.361 --> 44:57.031
What are you gonna do?

44:57.064 --> 45:01.068
Just remember to breathe.

45:37.104 --> 45:37.505
Breathe.

45:37.539 --> 45:38.272
I can breathe.

45:38.305 --> 45:38.839
Breathe.

45:38.872 --> 45:39.507
Definitely breathing.

46:07.401 --> 46:11.005
It's for the circulation.

46:11.038 --> 46:12.339
It's working.

46:31.992 --> 46:34.529
I'm Alia.

46:34.562 --> 46:38.566
I like you.

46:38.600 --> 46:40.934
I have no idea what to do
with that.

46:49.476 --> 46:52.212
What would you do with this?

46:52.246 --> 46:53.615
With that?

46:53.648 --> 46:57.552
Um, off the top of my head,
I would uh...

46:57.585 --> 47:00.354
I would free myself
and kill your family you know,

47:00.387 --> 47:01.355
pretty standard stuff.

47:01.388 --> 47:03.957
What?

47:03.991 --> 47:06.160
You can't.

47:06.193 --> 47:09.163
Well, I could, but uh,

47:09.196 --> 47:14.368
I'm guessing you
wouldn't like that very much.

47:14.401 --> 47:20.174
My family, they're insane.

47:20.207 --> 47:22.577
No!

47:22.610 --> 47:24.211
Well, I wouldn't say that.

47:24.244 --> 47:25.112
No.

47:25.145 --> 47:26.980
But you can't kill them.

47:27.014 --> 47:29.083
Hey, listen, no offense,

47:29.116 --> 47:30.384
but fuck that, they're dead.

47:31.085 --> 47:33.087
No, I mean really you can't.

47:33.120 --> 47:37.091
Like you won't be able.

47:37.124 --> 47:38.292
Then we'll leave.

47:38.325 --> 47:39.293
They will find us.

47:39.326 --> 47:40.227
You don't know that.

47:40.260 --> 47:41.495
How do you know that?

47:41.529 --> 47:43.297
'Cause they always do.

47:43.330 --> 47:47.034
And when they do,
we will pay.

47:47.067 --> 47:52.206
This is all because of him,
because of Pati.

47:52.239 --> 47:54.609
Who the fuck is Pati?

47:54.642 --> 47:57.010
Oh, he's my brother.

47:57.044 --> 48:00.648
The oldest and hungriest.

48:00.682 --> 48:03.917
He's the reason you're here

48:03.951 --> 48:07.187
and very soon there will be
nothing left of you.

48:10.124 --> 48:12.192
Is she sayin'

48:12.226 --> 48:13.327
Are you saying

48:13.360 --> 48:14.928
that you're...

48:14.962 --> 48:16.497
that I'm

48:19.166 --> 48:21.168
Lunch?

48:23.671 --> 48:25.239
And dinner.

48:31.579 --> 48:33.681
He was born a monster

48:33.715 --> 48:36.350
with a taste for only one thing.

48:44.124 --> 48:45.392
They tried alternatives

48:45.426 --> 48:47.127
and for a while
it seemed to work.

48:50.297 --> 48:51.432
But when he had a craving,

48:51.465 --> 48:53.267
there was never
any other option.

48:53.300 --> 48:59.006
The hunger was insatiable.

48:59.039 --> 48:59.973
So finally, they gave in

49:00.007 --> 49:03.010
to the one solution
they'd been avoiding.

49:06.146 --> 49:08.382
Mmm, this is awesome.

49:08.415 --> 49:09.416
Thank you so much.

49:09.450 --> 49:10.685
You're very welcome.

49:10.718 --> 49:12.687
I was literally starving.

49:12.720 --> 49:15.389
You're a real lifesaver.

50:37.204 --> 50:40.407
He never grew up,
never grew out of it.

50:40.808 --> 50:44.311
Night after night,
I saw more and more death.

50:48.750 --> 50:54.354
More and more blood.

51:09.737 --> 51:14.742
For years, I tried,
but they always found me.

51:18.378 --> 51:21.248
So when Ollie was born,
I had no choice but to try

51:21.281 --> 51:23.150
and save him from these horrors.

51:47.374 --> 51:48.776
But it was pointless.

51:48.810 --> 51:52.479
Phew!

51:52.513 --> 51:56.551
And they found a way,
as they always did,

51:56.584 --> 52:03.558
to make sure that I would
never ever leave again.

52:03.591 --> 52:09.797
And for years, I haven't.

53:33.014 --> 53:34.749
All I've ever wanted was
for someone

53:34.782 --> 53:39.854
to come save me
from this horrible place.

53:39.887 --> 53:42.790
Hello?

53:42.824 --> 53:45.660
Lady, I am right here!

53:45.693 --> 53:47.762
Your crazy-ass family...
please, don't walk away.

53:47.795 --> 53:50.565
Your crazy-ass family is
gone, okay?

53:50.598 --> 53:52.299
I've got a head start on him.

53:52.332 --> 53:53.701
Hmm, alright?

53:53.735 --> 53:55.770
So just toss me the knife

53:55.803 --> 53:57.471
and we can get the fuck out
of here.

53:57.505 --> 53:59.707
You and me both of us,
we'll blow this joint.

53:59.741 --> 54:01.274
Come on, you and me.

54:01.308 --> 54:02.777
Come on, come on.

54:02.810 --> 54:07.815
This won't change anything,
as much as I wish it would.

54:09.717 --> 54:14.522
I know I'm just
committing suicide, but

54:23.430 --> 54:25.867
Your English is really
good, by the way.

54:25.900 --> 54:27.702
Insatiable?

54:27.735 --> 54:29.771
It's... well, it's insatiable,
but it's good.

54:29.804 --> 54:31.038
It's really good.

54:31.072 --> 54:33.040
Thanks.

54:33.074 --> 54:35.042
Yeah.

54:37.979 --> 54:40.948
I wasn't meant for this life.

54:40.982 --> 54:41.649
They knew it.

54:43.450 --> 54:44.919
But never did they care.

54:47.354 --> 54:49.824
I've seen so many die.

54:49.857 --> 54:51.626
Well, I kinda figured that,
so

54:52.894 --> 54:56.429
No, no, I never wanted to.

54:56.463 --> 54:59.934
They forced me to feed him.

54:59.967 --> 55:02.537
But I never in my heart felt
like they do.

55:03.403 --> 55:06.941
I have dreams to heal,
not destroy.

55:10.578 --> 55:13.446
I want to be a doctor.

55:15.783 --> 55:17.450
Yeah, well, I'm sure
you get a lot of practice

55:17.484 --> 55:18.753
in this fuckin' place.

55:22.023 --> 55:23.658
I wish Pati was never born.

55:23.691 --> 55:26.761
I never wanted to be part of it.

55:26.794 --> 55:29.764
That's why they hate me so much.

55:29.797 --> 55:34.467
I've fed people to my

55:34.501 --> 55:36.103
Well, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

55:36.137 --> 55:42.610
Hey, I talk to myself
you know,

55:42.643 --> 55:49.650
so we all have issues,
you know?

55:49.684 --> 55:51.652
Why?

55:51.686 --> 55:53.821
Um, why what?

55:53.855 --> 55:57.925
Why do you talk to yourself?

55:57.959 --> 56:01.929
It was something I picked up
while I was in prison.

56:01.963 --> 56:05.533
Bitch, I've been with you
for longer than that.

56:05.566 --> 56:09.704
You were in prison?

56:09.737 --> 56:10.905
I was, yeah.

56:10.938 --> 56:12.740
Hello?

56:12.773 --> 56:13.541
Afghanistan?

56:13.574 --> 56:14.942
OEFA?

56:14.976 --> 56:17.612
Why?

56:17.645 --> 56:20.748
It's a long story.

56:20.781 --> 56:22.917
Tell me.

56:22.950 --> 56:25.620
I'd love to, I really would.

56:25.653 --> 56:29.957
I'd love nothing more,
but now really isn't the time.

56:29.991 --> 56:31.993
Oh, and I'm sure you forget
about the bank already

56:32.026 --> 56:33.694
then, huh?

56:40.968 --> 56:44.038
Hey, but I'll tell you what.

56:44.071 --> 56:47.041
If we get out of here,

56:47.074 --> 56:49.476
I'll tell you the whole story
over dinner.

56:49.510 --> 56:50.645
What do you say, huh?

56:50.678 --> 56:51.879
I'll even pay, huh?

56:53.080 --> 56:54.849
You're not vegan though,
are you?

56:54.882 --> 56:57.184
'Cause that'd be a turn off.

56:57.218 --> 56:59.553
What's a vegan?

56:59.587 --> 57:02.890
Uh, a vegan is like a person,
but a...

57:07.662 --> 57:09.997
I'm assuming
you shouldn't be here.

57:40.828 --> 57:41.996
What?

57:42.029 --> 57:44.632
Son of a mother...

57:44.665 --> 57:46.834
Hang in there whatever happens.

57:49.670 --> 57:52.506
You.

57:52.540 --> 57:55.609
I can't wait
to end your miserable life,

57:55.643 --> 58:00.748
you fucking psycho twat!

58:32.213 --> 58:33.848
I have to go now.

58:33.881 --> 58:36.917
How will you get by 'em?

58:36.951 --> 58:37.852
I'll find a way.

58:52.133 --> 58:56.003
Bloody hell.

59:47.154 --> 59:52.927
Kill them all.

01:00:04.738 --> 01:00:06.207
What the fuck?

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:08.209
He fuckin' shoot himself?

01:00:39.907 --> 01:00:41.408
Right there.

01:00:41.442 --> 01:00:43.744
He's right there,
you fuckin' idiot!

01:00:45.779 --> 01:00:47.181
Dude, have you seen this shit?

01:00:47.214 --> 01:00:47.848
What is it?

01:00:47.882 --> 01:00:49.683
It's a bank getting robbed.

01:00:49.717 --> 01:00:51.819
A fuckin' robbery.

01:00:54.088 --> 01:00:55.789
Some dude goes
apeshit on the robbers.

01:00:55.823 --> 01:00:56.724
This is fuckin' sick.

01:00:56.757 --> 01:00:57.725
He took his fuckin' gun.

01:00:57.758 --> 01:00:58.859
Wow!

01:00:58.893 --> 01:01:00.127
Oh shit, dude,
watch, watch, watch, watch.

01:01:00.161 --> 01:01:01.695
Hands are up, alright?

01:01:01.729 --> 01:01:03.030
Holy shit.

01:01:03.063 --> 01:01:04.165
Oh, he's gonna to shoot
him, he's gonna shoot him.

01:01:04.198 --> 01:01:06.200
- Let's not watch that...
- Would you stop?

01:01:06.233 --> 01:01:09.136
Well, you should watch,
it's comin', it's comin'.

01:01:09.170 --> 01:01:10.304
- Oh, what the fuck!
- Oh!

01:01:10.337 --> 01:01:11.405
Oh, come on!

01:01:11.438 --> 01:01:15.075
They always censor
the good shit.

01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:16.844
He's right
there, you fuckin' idiot!

01:01:21.115 --> 01:01:22.416
Hands are up, alright?

01:01:22.449 --> 01:01:23.350
Okay?

01:01:23.384 --> 01:01:24.151
Just take it easy.

01:01:24.185 --> 01:01:26.320
Hit, hit, hit.

01:01:26.353 --> 01:01:26.820
Wait.

01:01:26.854 --> 01:01:27.721
Wait, wait, wait!

01:01:38.766 --> 01:01:39.833
This guy is badass.

01:01:46.974 --> 01:01:49.176
What the fuck are you doing?

01:01:51.378 --> 01:01:52.246
No, no.

01:01:52.279 --> 01:01:53.047
No!

01:01:58.319 --> 01:02:01.355
Fuck.

01:02:01.388 --> 01:02:04.758
Alright, everybody,
get up and get out, I got this.

01:02:06.327 --> 01:02:07.895
Oh, hang tight back there.

01:02:07.928 --> 01:02:09.964
I'll only be a moment.

01:02:11.232 --> 01:02:13.200
Come on, let's go!

01:02:13.234 --> 01:02:16.003
Now, Rex does somethin'
I personally wouldn't recommend.

01:02:17.104 --> 01:02:19.974
And that's turning his back
on the remaining threat.

01:02:20.007 --> 01:02:21.809
You'll see in a second
why he does,

01:02:21.842 --> 01:02:23.777
but with the backroom still full
of employees

01:02:23.811 --> 01:02:25.079
and an active shooter,

01:02:25.112 --> 01:02:27.982
he's takin' a big risk
by leaving them behind.

01:02:28.015 --> 01:02:30.484
What he does instead
is approach

01:02:30.518 --> 01:02:32.486
one of the downed gunmen.

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:34.522
What he says, we can't hear.

01:02:42.530 --> 01:02:44.331
Was it worth it?

01:02:44.365 --> 01:02:47.501
Hmm?

01:02:50.170 --> 01:02:51.839
You move again,

01:02:51.872 --> 01:02:53.941
I'll run my foot
down your fuckin' throat, okay?

01:02:58.245 --> 01:02:59.547
Suck my balls.

01:02:59.581 --> 01:03:01.315
No, that's disgusting.

01:03:01.348 --> 01:03:01.849
Yippee ki...

01:03:01.882 --> 01:03:03.817
No, it's been done.

01:03:03.851 --> 01:03:06.420
I still... fuck.

01:03:06.453 --> 01:03:08.455
Time to die, hell boy.

01:03:08.757 --> 01:03:10.324
Boom!

01:03:10.357 --> 01:03:12.560
Shotgun number 3.

01:03:15.396 --> 01:03:17.031
There's no
denyin' the heroic nature

01:03:17.064 --> 01:03:19.900
of Mr. Coen's intentions
and actions.

01:03:19.933 --> 01:03:23.137
But his reckless approach
and chaotic manner,

01:03:23.170 --> 01:03:26.541
which he felt was
absolutely necessary

01:03:26.574 --> 01:03:30.277
to meet his personal fantasies,

01:03:30.311 --> 01:03:34.616
cost an innocent mother
her life.

01:03:34.649 --> 01:03:39.153
He may have meant
well, but his rash decisions

01:03:39.186 --> 01:03:42.524
left Angela Reynolds dead.

01:04:04.211 --> 01:04:05.647
Hold it right there, Charlie.

01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:06.581
I'll blow her head off.

01:04:06.614 --> 01:04:08.248
Gun down or she dies.

01:04:08.282 --> 01:04:10.484
Okay.

01:04:10.518 --> 01:04:11.985
Then you die, you know that,
right?

01:04:12.687 --> 01:04:13.521
You want this girl to die?

01:04:13.555 --> 01:04:15.289
Honestly, I don't give a fuck,

01:04:15.322 --> 01:04:18.593
I do wanna shoot you, though,
real bad.

01:04:18.626 --> 01:04:20.027
Shoot him in the dick.

01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:22.229
I'm gonna count to 3,
and only 3...

01:04:22.262 --> 01:04:23.163
And then you die

01:04:23.197 --> 01:04:23.931
You know, I get it.

01:04:23.964 --> 01:04:24.498
I get it.

01:04:24.532 --> 01:04:26.433
Shoot him in the dick.

01:04:26.467 --> 01:04:28.936
This wasn't self-defense.

01:04:28.969 --> 01:04:30.237
This was madness.

01:04:31.071 --> 01:04:33.608
1, 2, 3...

01:04:33.641 --> 01:04:34.609
Fuck, man, stop.

01:04:34.642 --> 01:04:35.876
What are you doing?

01:04:35.909 --> 01:04:37.411
Fucking just...
I don't wanna die today.

01:04:37.444 --> 01:04:38.078
You don't wanna die today.

01:04:38.112 --> 01:04:41.516
She doesn't wanna die today.

01:04:41.549 --> 01:04:45.119
So drop our weapons,

01:04:45.152 --> 01:04:46.453
and I'll book her
to the back door,

01:04:46.487 --> 01:04:47.655
and be out of your hair.

01:04:47.689 --> 01:04:50.558
No fuss, no muss.

01:04:50.592 --> 01:04:52.359
All cool?

01:04:52.861 --> 01:04:54.962
Would you agree,
Mr. Coen, that it was your actions

01:04:54.995 --> 01:04:56.631
that led to the death
of Ms. Reynolds?

01:04:56.664 --> 01:04:58.600
No,

01:04:58.633 --> 01:05:03.971
because they murdered the guard
upon entry.

01:05:04.004 --> 01:05:06.974
They weren't hesitant
to start the shooting

01:05:07.007 --> 01:05:10.545
and they wanted us all
to see blood at their hands.

01:05:10.578 --> 01:05:12.946
There were multiple
incidences of violence from them.

01:05:12.980 --> 01:05:15.082
Unprovoked.

01:05:15.115 --> 01:05:17.050
They were the ones having fun
with the violence,

01:05:17.084 --> 01:05:21.155
I just acted

01:05:21.188 --> 01:05:24.258
before it became
something bigger.

01:05:24.291 --> 01:05:26.260
All cool?

01:05:26.293 --> 01:05:27.094
Maddy.

01:05:27.127 --> 01:05:28.530
See, in my mind

01:05:28.563 --> 01:05:31.465
I want you to very carefully,
very slowly

01:05:31.498 --> 01:05:34.268
and with my military training

01:05:34.301 --> 01:05:35.436
stand up.

01:05:35.469 --> 01:05:37.404
we were all witness
to a murder

01:05:37.438 --> 01:05:38.472
Huh, she's not goin' anywhere.

01:05:38.506 --> 01:05:41.509
I thought you didn't
wanna die today.

01:05:42.209 --> 01:05:43.711
And personally I don't feel

01:05:43.745 --> 01:05:45.312
that they were
gonna let any of us go.

01:05:45.345 --> 01:05:46.180
So no.

01:05:46.213 --> 01:05:47.314
Get up, come over here.

01:05:47.347 --> 01:05:48.148
Get behind me.

01:05:48.182 --> 01:05:50.083
I'd say it was their actions
that led

01:05:50.117 --> 01:05:50.785
to Ms. Reynolds' death.

01:05:50.819 --> 01:05:52.486
Don't you fuckin' move, fuck.

01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:53.755
Not mine.

01:05:53.788 --> 01:05:54.988
Don't you fuckin'
move, don't fuckin'...

01:05:55.022 --> 01:05:55.590
It's okay.

01:05:55.623 --> 01:06:00.994
Don't listen to him.

01:06:01.028 --> 01:06:03.397
Mr. Coen had won.

01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:04.732
It was over.

01:06:04.766 --> 01:06:08.469
No one else had to be harmed.

01:06:08.502 --> 01:06:11.472
But that wasn't good enough,
was it, Mr. Coen?

01:06:11.506 --> 01:06:13.708
We're cool, yeah?

01:06:13.741 --> 01:06:16.243
Alright.

01:06:16.544 --> 01:06:20.080
Shoot him in the dick!

01:06:34.461 --> 01:06:36.230
Fuck.

01:06:36.263 --> 01:06:37.364
Why?

01:06:37.397 --> 01:06:39.066
Why wasn't it good enough?

01:06:39.099 --> 01:06:41.068
Why the need
to immobilize the perpetrator

01:06:41.101 --> 01:06:45.239
in such a barbaric,
inhumane way?

01:06:45.272 --> 01:06:46.106
Well, I wanted him down

01:06:46.139 --> 01:06:48.075
and I didn't want him
to reproduce.

01:06:48.776 --> 01:06:52.279
It's a win, win.

01:06:54.582 --> 01:06:57.150
I felt like you meant it.

01:06:57.184 --> 01:06:57.819
I didn't.

01:06:57.852 --> 01:07:00.053
But I felt like you did.

01:07:00.087 --> 01:07:02.322
Well, I didn't.

01:07:02.356 --> 01:07:06.059
Maddy, Maddy, hey, hey.

01:07:06.093 --> 01:07:08.730
I did exactly
what I knew I had to do

01:07:08.763 --> 01:07:09.764
and it worked.

01:07:09.797 --> 01:07:11.465
Hmm?

01:07:13.133 --> 01:07:19.774
Rex, thank you for what you did.

01:07:19.807 --> 01:07:23.377
I know it doesn't seem like it,
but I'm truly, truly grateful.

01:07:23.410 --> 01:07:27.214
My family is, too.

01:07:27.247 --> 01:07:30.752
You did save my life.

01:07:30.785 --> 01:07:32.787
I just...

01:07:33.588 --> 01:07:36.323
Uh, I don't know how
to say this, 'cause it's awful.

01:07:36.356 --> 01:07:37.759
Just say it.

01:07:37.792 --> 01:07:40.795
Deal with the emotion later.

01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:50.203
I don't wanna see you.

01:07:50.237 --> 01:07:53.240
I mean, I...

01:07:56.176 --> 01:07:57.812
I don't want a life
that includes coming to prison

01:07:57.845 --> 01:07:59.212
to visit the man
who saved my life

01:07:59.246 --> 01:08:04.652
out of guilt
for half a decade.

01:08:04.686 --> 01:08:05.820
I know how bad that sounds,

01:08:05.853 --> 01:08:11.826
but that would be
the only reason.

01:08:11.859 --> 01:08:13.828
I'm sorry.

01:08:35.515 --> 01:08:36.249
What is that?

01:08:36.283 --> 01:08:39.754
Finland?

01:08:39.787 --> 01:08:42.790
Can't run away
from your problems, my friend.

01:08:42.823 --> 01:08:46.259
They always find a way
to catch up with you.

01:08:46.292 --> 01:08:48.395
Especially heart break.

01:08:48.428 --> 01:08:50.865
Can't outrun heart break.

01:08:52.299 --> 01:08:53.768
Rookie mistake.

01:08:53.801 --> 01:08:56.871
Yeah,
what would you know about it?

01:08:56.904 --> 01:09:00.508
More than you
think, but you do you, amigo.

01:09:00.541 --> 01:09:01.408
You do you.

01:09:01.441 --> 01:09:04.511
Just tryin'
to extend a helpin' hand.

01:09:04.545 --> 01:09:06.179
How is that possible?

01:09:07.615 --> 01:09:12.819
Yeah, I suppose you
uh, don't believe in fate, do you?

01:09:12.854 --> 01:09:15.255
That remains to be seen.

01:09:54.962 --> 01:09:56.263
Come here.

01:10:09.010 --> 01:10:10.945
Okay, okay, okay.

01:11:15.076 --> 01:11:21.649
Rex, now or never.

01:12:31.085 --> 01:12:32.620
Let's do it.

01:12:32.653 --> 01:12:35.623
Kill 'em all,
get her out of here.

01:12:35.656 --> 01:12:38.025
She's not my concern.

01:12:38.059 --> 01:12:40.393
What are you talkin' about?

01:12:40.427 --> 01:12:43.130
She practically begged you
to murder her family

01:12:43.164 --> 01:12:45.099
and take her away from here.

01:12:45.132 --> 01:12:49.502
Again, she is not my concern.

01:12:49.537 --> 01:12:53.708
My concern is getting back
to the life I had.

01:12:53.741 --> 01:12:56.110
Getting the fuck out
of this place

01:12:56.143 --> 01:12:58.512
and getting back to my friends
in the good old US of A

01:12:58.546 --> 01:13:02.149
where we
don't fucking eat people.

01:13:02.183 --> 01:13:03.718
Capisce?

01:13:03.751 --> 01:13:06.520
So what are we doing then,
hmm?

01:13:08.556 --> 01:13:09.824
We're leaving.

01:13:11.092 --> 01:13:15.730
This is in case anybody's
waiting for us up there.

01:13:15.763 --> 01:13:16.964
You're not leaving without her.

01:13:18.199 --> 01:13:23.470
I'm not going out of
my way to save some girl.

01:13:23.503 --> 01:13:25.873
No girl.

01:13:25.907 --> 01:13:27.909
Not this time.

01:13:50.197 --> 01:13:51.866
How much time do we have?

01:13:51.899 --> 01:13:53.868
Not enough.

01:13:53.901 --> 01:14:00.074
Ay, yai, yai, yai,
yai, yai, yai, yai, yai.

01:15:09.944 --> 01:15:12.580
She's scared.

01:15:12.613 --> 01:15:15.082
She isn't like them.

01:15:16.817 --> 01:15:20.988
She isn't
Maddy, it's not the same.

01:15:21.022 --> 01:15:23.991
Maddy never wanted you.

01:15:24.025 --> 01:15:25.259
Maddy never needed you.

01:15:25.292 --> 01:15:28.763
This girl though, she...

01:15:28.796 --> 01:15:30.264
She does need you, Rex.

01:15:30.297 --> 01:15:31.966
She's been needing you
her whole life.

01:15:35.202 --> 01:15:37.605
Don't turn your back on her.

01:16:44.772 --> 01:16:46.107
And if I didn't know any better

01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:49.610
I'd say you need her
as much as she needs you.

01:16:54.915 --> 01:16:58.252
Yeah, you forget, buddy.

01:16:58.285 --> 01:17:00.654
I live in your head.

01:17:30.084 --> 01:17:33.053
New man out.

01:20:32.232 --> 01:20:34.001
Oh!

01:21:14.074 --> 01:21:14.609
Hey.

01:22:21.175 --> 01:22:25.179
I guess you don't watch the news
that much, huh?

01:23:35.449 --> 01:23:40.588
We just killed
your entire family.

01:23:40.622 --> 01:23:42.757
How do you feel about that?

01:23:44.526 --> 01:23:49.531
I have mixed emotions.

01:23:52.099 --> 01:23:55.803
It's fair.

01:23:55.837 --> 01:23:58.773
It's emotions, by the way.

01:24:04.546 --> 01:24:06.079
What was that?

01:24:06.113 --> 01:24:06.480
Pati.

01:24:06.514 --> 01:24:07.582
Pati.

01:24:15.623 --> 01:24:16.758
That's your brother.

01:24:16.791 --> 01:24:18.325
Mm-mm.

01:24:19.794 --> 01:24:21.629
I thought you said
he never grew up.

01:24:21.663 --> 01:24:23.430
I meant mentally.

01:24:23.463 --> 01:24:25.132
Would have been nice to know,
Alia.

01:24:25.165 --> 01:24:26.634
Sorry.

01:24:34.341 --> 01:24:36.209
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

01:24:36.878 --> 01:24:39.446
Pati, Pati.

01:24:39.479 --> 01:24:41.415
Pati, Pati.

01:24:42.282 --> 01:24:43.751
Pati, Pati.

01:24:51.291 --> 01:24:53.828
Pati.

01:24:53.861 --> 01:24:56.163
Pati.

01:25:05.205 --> 01:25:07.775
She started it.

01:25:11.813 --> 01:25:12.547
Don't, don't.

01:25:15.717 --> 01:25:16.884
Pati, Pati.

01:25:27.294 --> 01:25:28.261
Pati.

01:25:28.295 --> 01:25:29.363
Pati.

01:25:53.721 --> 01:25:54.889
Pati!

01:25:59.527 --> 01:26:00.695
Pati!

01:26:15.275 --> 01:26:16.611
Do you want it?

01:26:16.644 --> 01:26:17.812
Do you want it?

01:26:17.845 --> 01:26:19.947
Eat it, Pati!

01:26:33.493 --> 01:26:36.363
You sick, twisted fuck.

01:26:46.406 --> 01:26:49.409
Any more giant siblings
I should know about, Alia?

01:26:52.479 --> 01:26:53.848
No, no.

01:26:53.881 --> 01:26:55.950
We're safe now.

01:27:10.631 --> 01:27:12.600
That was a good last line.

01:27:12.633 --> 01:27:14.569
"Eat it, Pati!"

01:27:14.602 --> 01:27:17.972
That's from Misery, right?

01:27:18.005 --> 01:27:18.873
Yeah.

01:27:19.540 --> 01:27:20.975
Yeah, it was good, it was good.

01:27:21.008 --> 01:27:23.711
You know, what would have been
better, though?

01:27:23.745 --> 01:27:25.880
It's if you said something
along the lines of uh,

01:27:25.913 --> 01:27:28.616
"You're finished", you know?

01:27:28.649 --> 01:27:32.285
Or something like,
"Finish your vegetables.

01:27:32.319 --> 01:27:32.854
Uh."

01:27:32.887 --> 01:27:34.889
You know what I mean?

01:27:34.922 --> 01:27:35.890
Because they're...

01:27:35.923 --> 01:27:36.524
You know, anything
with finish in it really,

01:27:36.557 --> 01:27:38.760
because they are Finnish.

01:28:00.581 --> 01:28:02.415
So when we get there,

01:28:02.449 --> 01:28:03.785
what do you wanna do
with you little brother?

01:28:03.818 --> 01:28:04.819
Kill him?

01:28:06.554 --> 01:28:07.522
No!

01:28:07.555 --> 01:28:09.657
We're taking him with us.

01:28:09.690 --> 01:28:11.826
Oh, okay.

01:28:11.859 --> 01:28:12.860
Okay.

01:28:22.103 --> 01:28:25.740
So how did you two meet?

01:28:25.773 --> 01:28:29.544
Uh, well,

01:28:29.577 --> 01:28:33.748
I was on vacation in Finland.

01:28:33.781 --> 01:28:37.718
And uh,
and her parents hated me.

01:28:38.753 --> 01:28:40.655
Uh, like biblically hated me.

01:28:41.823 --> 01:28:45.993
Alright, anyway, it turns out,
she had four brothers.

01:28:46.027 --> 01:28:47.360
You know,
each was a little quirky

01:29:21.963 --> 01:29:24.397
So I killed her entire family

01:29:24.431 --> 01:29:27.400
and we've been a couple
ever since.

01:29:36.744 --> 01:29:37.912
What?
