01:15.520 --> 01:17.317
Oh, here comes Daddy.

01:17.520 --> 01:18.999
How do I look?

01:19.200 --> 01:21.156
- Terrific, Mom.
- Good.

01:21.360 --> 01:25.831
You know, every payday I like Daddy
to see what his last check went for.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.993
Assume the position.

01:32.160 --> 01:34.879
Hi. Nice to see you.
Good to be back.

01:35.080 --> 01:36.877
If anyone needs me,
I'll be on the couch.

01:37.080 --> 01:39.594
Goodbye. So long.
Don't write. Don't call.

01:40.640 --> 01:44.110
Al, perhaps you didn't see us.

01:45.920 --> 01:47.638
I think he's playing dumb.

01:47.840 --> 01:51.958
No, honey. I've known him for years.
He's not playing.

01:52.560 --> 01:56.155
- Where's the money, Al?
- I got robbed.

01:56.600 --> 02:00.309
I was driving home and I drove by the
bank, and the street was cordoned off.

02:00.520 --> 02:03.114
So I knew I shouldn't
get out of the car, but I did...

02:03.320 --> 02:04.912
...and that's when they jumped me.

02:05.120 --> 02:07.588
- Muggers, Al?
- Worse.

02:07.800 --> 02:09.392
Bankers.

02:10.560 --> 02:12.596
Bill collectors,
electric-company reps...

02:12.800 --> 02:15.598
...that wiry little woman
from the water company.

02:15.800 --> 02:17.153
They were all there.

02:17.360 --> 02:19.396
They threw me down,
forced a pen in my hand...

02:19.600 --> 02:21.875
...and made me pay bills
against my will.

02:22.720 --> 02:24.995
I felt so violated.

02:25.760 --> 02:27.557
But I fought like a wildcat...

02:27.760 --> 02:29.318
...and I think I felt a toe snap...

02:29.520 --> 02:32.512
...when I bit through that
water-company babe's penny loafer.

02:33.480 --> 02:37.234
And that gas guy's gonna be reading
meters out of one eye for a while.

02:37.880 --> 02:40.155
Well, you know, this is my own fault.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.191
The organ grinder
who owns the monkey...

02:42.400 --> 02:44.834
...doesn't let him have the check.

02:45.040 --> 02:47.793
You're the organ grinder, all right.

02:51.320 --> 02:53.709
Hey, what's this?

02:55.000 --> 02:57.639
Well, it was my handkerchief.

02:57.840 --> 02:59.717
Here, boy.

03:02.280 --> 03:03.508
Good boy.

03:03.720 --> 03:06.678
Hey, kids, look at this.

03:06.880 --> 03:10.953
It's a brochure announcing
a monthly shoe-sales contest.

03:11.160 --> 03:15.551
And the winner gets a free
first-class trip to Hawaii.

03:15.760 --> 03:18.513
Well, that's fine for the winner,
but what would Dad get?

03:20.760 --> 03:23.354
So you bowel-constricting vampires
I call loved ones...

03:23.560 --> 03:25.755
...think I couldn't possibly
be a winner, huh?

03:25.960 --> 03:28.315
- No.
- Not really.

03:28.800 --> 03:31.473
Oh, sure, I pulled the handle
on the slot machine of life...

03:31.680 --> 03:34.194
...and come up with prune, lemon...

03:34.400 --> 03:36.789
...and the lonely Mr. Cherry.

03:41.880 --> 03:43.916
But I was a high school hero.

03:44.120 --> 03:45.519
And I can do it again.

03:45.720 --> 03:48.757
Any man who can score
four touchdowns in a single game...

03:48.960 --> 03:51.269
...after a night with your mother...

03:51.480 --> 03:53.789
...is surely capable of new glory.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.958
Al Bundy will win this contest
and go to Hawaii.

03:57.160 --> 03:59.071
- First class.
- How come the winner...

03:59.280 --> 04:00.998
- ... only gets one ticket?
- Otherwise...

04:01.200 --> 04:03.919
...he'd have to take his wife.
Where's the incentive there?

04:05.920 --> 04:07.717
Here he comes.

04:07.920 --> 04:10.070
He's coming in for a pit stop.

04:13.280 --> 04:16.954
Sold 24 pair of shoes,
and I'm in third place.

04:18.519 --> 04:20.192
Shower me.

04:22.560 --> 04:24.437
Squeegee me.

04:26.360 --> 04:27.588
Shoe me.

04:27.800 --> 04:30.155
Fratella's in second place,
but I can take him.

04:30.360 --> 04:34.194
He goes home at night to visit his wife.
The sap still loves her.

04:34.560 --> 04:36.516
Luckily I don't have that problem.

04:37.960 --> 04:40.235
No time for frivolity.

04:40.760 --> 04:42.352
Freshen me.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.238
Shirt me.

04:47.680 --> 04:49.193
Shoe me.

04:50.080 --> 04:52.036
Get away from me.

04:53.920 --> 04:57.230
I am now ready to sell.

04:58.920 --> 05:02.037
That should be Marcie
coming to buy shoes.

05:05.880 --> 05:07.438
The strangest thing just happened.

05:07.640 --> 05:08.868
I was taking a shower...

05:09.080 --> 05:11.992
...and someone broke in
and stole all my shoes.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.357
How odd.

05:19.480 --> 05:22.392
I only hope that this is not a night
in which you need shoes.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.352
Well, you know she does,
Al, I told you.

05:24.560 --> 05:27.552
We have a big, important dinner
with the bank president, remember?

05:27.760 --> 05:30.433
Marcie was in the shower,
you told me my hair was a mess...

05:30.640 --> 05:33.950
...so of course, I ran off to fix it.
When I came back, you were gone.

05:34.160 --> 05:35.912
You must have just missed
the burglar.

05:36.120 --> 05:39.669
Anyway, hey, how's my hair?

05:40.720 --> 05:41.948
Soft, yet manageable.

05:42.160 --> 05:44.549
Now, Marcie, as a friend
who's also in the business...

05:44.760 --> 05:47.035
...let me fix you up
with a nice pair of shoes.

05:47.240 --> 05:49.993
Now, just sit down right here
and put your feet in my hands.

05:50.200 --> 05:52.668
You're not gonna look up my dress,
are you?

05:56.280 --> 05:58.510
I'm not going through
the rest of my life blind...

05:58.720 --> 06:00.039
...just to sell you shoes.

06:04.080 --> 06:06.992
Now, here, let me show you
a very nice set of pumps.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.270
Two-inch heels, which,
by coincidence...

06:09.480 --> 06:11.755
...match your dress exactly.

06:11.960 --> 06:15.350
- They're perfect. I'll take them.
- Fine. That'll be $500.

06:15.560 --> 06:17.232
Five hundred dollars?

06:17.440 --> 06:18.793
Well, they came in a six-pack.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.070
Apparently, they were
a family of cats...

06:21.280 --> 06:23.236
...and we were asked
not to separate them.

06:23.440 --> 06:25.635
But trust me.
They weren't killed for shoes.

06:25.840 --> 06:27.956
They were all run over by cars.

06:29.680 --> 06:32.194
That must be where they get
Hush Puppies.

06:34.120 --> 06:36.793
Oh, spare me.
Just give me the shoes.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.309
I'm tired of looking at myself
in your head.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.350
Come on, Jefferson, we're late.

06:42.560 --> 06:46.075
And remember, after dinner when
they serve the cigars and brandy...

06:46.280 --> 06:48.430
...you go in the other room
with the wives.

06:48.640 --> 06:51.154
All right, but I better get
a phone book for my pants...

06:51.360 --> 06:53.237
...because every time
it's the same thing.

06:53.440 --> 06:55.271
The lights "accidentally" go out...

06:55.480 --> 06:58.472
...and I'm the helpless victim
of a gang-goose.

06:58.680 --> 07:02.195
Look, those people
are important to my career.

07:02.400 --> 07:04.311
You'll take it and like it, missy.

07:09.920 --> 07:12.559
Marcie, come on. I need some help.
The wind has picked up.

07:12.760 --> 07:16.116
Could be disastrous for my hair.
You know.

07:22.520 --> 07:24.351
Mom. You know what I'm thinking?

07:25.160 --> 07:28.118
That we should go upstairs
and split up Marcie's shoes?

07:28.320 --> 07:31.596
No, I was just wondering
what I was thinking, because I forgot.

07:37.400 --> 07:38.958
Hi, Dad.

07:42.440 --> 07:45.910
- This is Petal.
- It's part of a flower.

07:48.480 --> 07:52.155
Isn't she great?
I met her in Quantum Physics.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.228
Hold my calls.

07:55.080 --> 07:57.469
There never are any, son.

07:57.680 --> 07:59.591
Never mind that now, Dad.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.597
See you tomorrow.

08:02.720 --> 08:04.392
Young lady!

08:05.640 --> 08:07.278
Young lady, you do realize...

08:07.480 --> 08:09.835
...that's my son's bedroom
you're going to?

08:10.040 --> 08:11.632
Yes.

08:25.720 --> 08:29.110
Hey, nice shoes.

08:32.520 --> 08:34.238
Dad, don't.

08:35.039 --> 08:37.155
Come on, Dad. Dad, no.

08:41.280 --> 08:43.395
Come on, Bud. Get over it.

08:43.600 --> 08:46.592
What is one girl
in the grand scheme of your life?

08:46.800 --> 08:49.109
Just your only chance.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.475
Oh, come on, you're not alone in this.

08:52.680 --> 08:56.309
I myself have never
had a woman, and I'm fine.

08:57.480 --> 08:59.357
And neither has Mom.

08:59.560 --> 09:02.233
And lately, neither has your father.

09:04.080 --> 09:05.638
Family.

09:06.600 --> 09:08.556
Bask in the glory.

09:08.760 --> 09:10.193
I did it.

09:10.400 --> 09:12.595
I won the contest.

09:19.080 --> 09:21.878
You're looking at
the shoe salesman of the month.

09:22.080 --> 09:25.231
I'm going to Hawaii. First class.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.715
And you know what they have
in first class?

09:27.920 --> 09:30.354
Unlimited peanuts.

09:31.040 --> 09:34.953
And a passenger-lavatory ratio
of only six to one.

09:35.160 --> 09:37.628
Gee, I'm gonna miss you guys.

09:39.000 --> 09:42.151
Well, hang onto
your haemorrhoids, honey.

09:42.360 --> 09:43.588
I have news for you.

09:43.800 --> 09:46.951
I called the airlines
and there's been a change of plans.

09:47.160 --> 09:51.073
I traded your first-class ticket in
for four standbys.

09:51.280 --> 09:53.999
We're all going to Hawaii together.

09:55.680 --> 09:57.079
And, Dad...

09:57.280 --> 09:59.669
...it was my idea.

09:59.880 --> 10:02.872
Oh, that was so smart.

10:15.240 --> 10:18.038
Well, standby isn't too bad.

10:18.240 --> 10:20.959
I mean, how long can they
possibly make us wait?

10:43.000 --> 10:44.991
Well, I checked on Seven.

10:45.200 --> 10:46.838
Marcie found him where we left him.

10:47.040 --> 10:49.076
In her guest room.

10:49.280 --> 10:50.713
She said she'd look after him.

10:50.920 --> 10:54.708
She's just amazed by the things
that happen when she's in the shower.

10:54.920 --> 10:57.434
- Well, what about Buck?
- Oh, I took care of that.

10:57.640 --> 10:59.517
I opened up six cans of dog food...

10:59.720 --> 11:02.837
...and I told him to only
eat one each day.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.760
And I could tell by the way
he dug into that first can...

11:05.960 --> 11:07.712
...that he understood completely.

11:07.920 --> 11:09.148
Some man...

11:09.360 --> 11:10.588
...or men...

11:10.800 --> 11:13.473
...are gonna be very lucky
to have you one day.

11:15.840 --> 11:17.319
<i>Attention, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

11:17.520 --> 11:22.230
<i>In the first-class lounge
the champagne is now 42 degrees.</i>

11:22.440 --> 11:27.195
<i>And, as always, unlimited peanuts
are now being served.</i>

11:29.280 --> 11:30.713
First class.

11:30.920 --> 11:33.718
Champagne.
Peanuts flowing like wine.

11:33.920 --> 11:35.478
That was supposed to be me.

11:48.240 --> 11:51.710
Welcome to the first-class lounge.
May I see your ticket, sir?

11:54.880 --> 11:56.950
This is standby.

11:57.160 --> 11:59.116
You embarrass me and yourself.

12:01.760 --> 12:03.478
- Excuse me.
- Hey.

12:03.680 --> 12:05.830
It's John Sebastian.

12:10.720 --> 12:12.312
Believe in magic, buddy.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.230
I seem to have lost my ticket.

12:19.440 --> 12:21.351
Oh, it doesn't matter, Mr. Sebastian.

12:21.560 --> 12:26.270
We know you. Go right in.
As always, the peanuts are unlimited.

12:26.760 --> 12:28.671
Life is good.

12:30.120 --> 12:31.792
I should have said I lost my ticket.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.675
Wouldn't have done any good.
You're not a rock star.

12:48.040 --> 12:51.749
Oh, Richie Havens. Welcome, sir.

12:53.160 --> 12:57.358
Spencer Davis. Good to see you.

12:58.320 --> 13:01.517
Robby Krieger. I love the Doors.

13:02.360 --> 13:05.397
- Mark Lindsay, always a pleasure.
- Thank you.

13:05.600 --> 13:08.831
Peter Noone. Please come in.

13:09.040 --> 13:11.998
Hey, man. Groovy there. Right on.

13:15.120 --> 13:16.348
Peace, love...

13:16.560 --> 13:19.791
...and women shouldn't
have to cook, man.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.275
Dig it, I'm hip.

13:24.080 --> 13:26.992
Try to keep the groupies off me
if you can.

13:27.440 --> 13:30.113
Excuse me, excuse me.

13:30.320 --> 13:32.880
- Ticket, please.
- Well...

13:33.080 --> 13:37.517
...must've left it in the limo.
Rock 'n' roll always forgets.

13:38.280 --> 13:41.511
I'm sorry, sir, but I don't recognize you.
You'll need a ticket.

13:43.760 --> 13:45.876
Sebastian. John, my man.

13:46.080 --> 13:48.071
Come here.

13:48.280 --> 13:51.078
Hey, how you doing?

13:53.520 --> 13:55.670
How they hanging, fellow rock bro?

13:55.880 --> 13:59.873
Well, let's just say I can find them
when I need them.

14:02.760 --> 14:05.638
Axle. Axle Bundy.

14:08.400 --> 14:11.870
You know, from-
From Shoes and Socks, remember?

14:12.080 --> 14:14.116
San Francisco, 1969.

14:14.320 --> 14:18.359
I don't remember too much
about 1969.

14:18.560 --> 14:20.357
Who does?

14:23.880 --> 14:27.156
But seriously, you must remember me
from the big concert last year.

14:27.360 --> 14:29.191
Live Aid.

14:29.400 --> 14:31.356
Lemonade.

14:31.760 --> 14:34.433
Kool-Aid, Ice Capade.
One of those.

14:35.120 --> 14:36.678
Yeah, I remember.

14:37.400 --> 14:40.233
Peter, look who's here.

14:43.480 --> 14:45.152
Who's he?

14:45.600 --> 14:47.238
Axle Bundy?

14:47.440 --> 14:50.238
Oh, Axle, great. Hey, I'm a big fan.

14:50.440 --> 14:53.716
I've got one of your records.
You remember the one that sold.

14:53.920 --> 14:55.148
Have you still got...

14:55.360 --> 14:57.351
...that tambourine-playing wife
in your band?

14:57.560 --> 15:00.120
Still screeches
horrible backup vocals.

15:01.920 --> 15:04.480
Hey, you must be-

15:04.680 --> 15:07.035
Just call me yours.

15:07.760 --> 15:11.116
Yeah, and we're Bombshell and Troll.

15:11.840 --> 15:13.990
Hey, fab. Hey, come on in.

15:14.200 --> 15:17.272
Unlimited peanuts for all in here.

15:22.480 --> 15:25.631
Hey, you got something on your tie-

15:38.240 --> 15:40.117
Sandwiches.

15:47.400 --> 15:49.550
Could you imagine living
like this all the time?

15:49.760 --> 15:52.433
No wonder Fergie's such a piglet.

15:54.240 --> 15:56.196
Could life be any grander?

15:56.400 --> 16:00.188
Who'd have thunk it?
Living it up with the geezers of rock.

16:00.840 --> 16:02.398
Speaking of geezers...

16:02.600 --> 16:04.591
...son, have you seen your mother?

16:04.800 --> 16:08.588
No, but if she's anywhere
on this stewardess, I'll find her.

16:10.320 --> 16:15.030
You are who I think of
when I have sex with my husband.

16:18.160 --> 16:23.234
You are who I think of
when I have sex with my husband.

16:26.560 --> 16:31.395
You are who I think of
when I have sex with my husband.

16:34.080 --> 16:36.116
You are who I think of when I-

16:39.200 --> 16:42.556
When I clean up the floor
around the toilet.

16:43.400 --> 16:45.436
Hey, Axle, come on
and join us over here.

16:45.640 --> 16:47.312
We're jamming.

16:47.520 --> 16:50.751
Yeah, come on, man.
It wouldn't be a jam without...

16:50.960 --> 16:52.916
Who is that guy?

16:53.120 --> 16:56.795
The name's Awful Grungy
or something.

16:57.560 --> 16:59.710
I don't- I don't know him.

16:59.920 --> 17:03.708
But I know that's Peggy,
and I believe we all remember her.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.435
I think I remember him.

17:10.640 --> 17:13.676
Didn't he use to be
the fifth Monkee?

17:14.079 --> 17:16.594
Hey, Ankle, we're waiting on you.
Come on.

17:16.800 --> 17:19.030
Come on, Daddy,
you never play at home.

17:19.240 --> 17:22.073
Oh, I don't know.

17:22.960 --> 17:25.030
- Hey, fellow rock bros.
- Hey.

17:25.240 --> 17:28.277
- I just had me a groupie.
- All right.

17:28.480 --> 17:29.879
Hey, why don't you jam with us.

17:31.920 --> 17:33.592
Come on, Al, for old time's sake.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.151
Hey, man, where'd you learn
to play pastrami like that?

18:13.360 --> 18:15.555
A little after-hours deli
on the South Side.

18:15.760 --> 18:19.355
Wild, man. You got cold cuts
in your blood, man.

18:19.560 --> 18:22.358
By the way, a little mustard
on your pants.

18:23.480 --> 18:26.552
<i>Flight 107 to Tucson
now boarding Gate 4A.</i>

18:26.760 --> 18:27.988
That's us. Let's go.

18:29.640 --> 18:30.868
Well.

18:31.080 --> 18:32.911
Come on, time to go.

18:33.120 --> 18:35.315
Say goodbye to first-class Axle...

18:35.520 --> 18:37.238
...and hello to standby Al.

18:39.960 --> 18:41.359
Hey, Axle.

18:41.560 --> 18:42.788
Where you going?

18:43.000 --> 18:44.513
Forgot my ticket.

18:44.720 --> 18:47.075
Ticket? You don't need a ticket.
Everybody knows you.

18:47.280 --> 18:49.874
Yeah, come on. We got
the whole first-class compartment...

18:50.080 --> 18:52.275
...all to ourselves.
And we're doing a benefit...

18:52.480 --> 18:54.789
...and we need all the big stars
we can get, Axle.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.560
Yeah, there aren't many
bigger stars than you...

18:57.760 --> 18:59.478
...Maxwell.

19:00.840 --> 19:05.356
Come on, we need your blue-eyed,
bad-wigged soul.

19:05.560 --> 19:06.879
Gee, why not, Al?

19:07.080 --> 19:09.116
It'd be just like singing
in the shower.

19:09.320 --> 19:10.673
If you sang.

19:10.880 --> 19:12.836
Or showered.

19:14.200 --> 19:15.428
Come on.

19:15.640 --> 19:16.868
Oh, all right. Let's go.

19:19.160 --> 19:21.355
Wait a second, wait a second.

19:25.840 --> 19:27.637
I need Lucille.

19:28.520 --> 19:31.318
- Take no prisoners.
- Peanuts!

19:33.320 --> 19:35.390
<i>All right. And now, as promised...</i>

19:35.600 --> 19:39.388
<i>...the world premiere
of the superstar video...</i>

19:39.600 --> 19:41.511
<i>...for Old Aid.</i>

19:48.400 --> 19:51.517
<i>We are the old</i>

19:51.720 --> 19:54.871
<i>We've got arthritis</i>

19:55.080 --> 19:58.197
<i>- Our gums are weak
- So weak</i>

19:58.400 --> 20:01.119
<i>From gingivitis</i>

20:03.440 --> 20:06.432
<i>We are the old</i>

20:06.640 --> 20:09.837
<i>We've got arthritis</i>

20:10.040 --> 20:16.070
<i>We are the ones who wear bifocals
And have bursitis</i>

20:17.600 --> 20:20.751
<i>There are people younger</i>

20:20.960 --> 20:23.952
<i>But we heed another call</i>

20:24.160 --> 20:27.436
<i>We really need the money</i>

20:27.640 --> 20:31.679
<i>Our accountants took it all</i>

20:31.880 --> 20:34.553
<i>We sing to you</i>

20:35.120 --> 20:38.192
<i>Those who have money</i>

20:38.400 --> 20:40.630
<i>Once we was cool</i>

20:40.840 --> 20:44.913
<i>But now we just dress funny</i>

20:45.120 --> 20:47.395
<i>We need your help</i>

20:47.600 --> 20:51.149
<i>So please, please dig deep</i>

20:51.360 --> 20:54.511
<i>Don't call after 10</i>

20:54.720 --> 20:58.679
<i>'Cause we'll be asleep</i>

20:58.880 --> 21:02.395
<i>We have Medicare</i>

21:02.600 --> 21:05.751
<i>And anti-gas pills</i>

21:05.960 --> 21:12.433
<i>But without your help
We can't pay our alimony bills</i>

21:12.640 --> 21:13.993
Take it, Axle.

21:26.960 --> 21:28.552
<i>We are the old</i>

21:28.760 --> 21:30.273
<i>They are the old</i>

21:30.480 --> 21:31.993
<i>We have arthritis</i>

21:32.200 --> 21:33.679
<i>They have arthritis</i>

21:33.880 --> 21:36.633
<i>Once we were gods</i>

21:36.840 --> 21:39.035
<i>Now golf excites us</i>

21:39.240 --> 21:40.798
Golf excites them.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.149
<i>So write a check</i>

21:42.360 --> 21:43.509
A really big one.

21:43.720 --> 21:46.712
<i>For our December</i>

21:46.920 --> 21:49.514
<i>There's one more verse</i>

21:49.720 --> 21:53.269
<i>But we can't remember</i>

22:02.760 --> 22:04.751
Sing this, Axle.

22:18.720 --> 22:20.995
One more time.
