00:31.840 --> 00:34.720
-What are you doing here?
-Gabi, what are you doing here?!

00:34.960 --> 00:36.640
I'm here on a field day.

00:37.880 --> 00:39.320
Listen...

00:39.960 --> 00:42.600
-I met him.
-Who?

00:42.760 --> 00:44.480
Abu Ahmad.

00:45.280 --> 00:48.240
I met him. I've reached them,
I'm deep inside the system.

00:48.400 --> 00:49.360
They don't realize who I am.

00:49.520 --> 00:50.920
-Doron--
-I can wipe him out right now.

00:51.080 --> 00:54.840
-I could finish him, Gabi.
-Don't worry. I'm taking you home.

01:01.160 --> 01:02.440
[ARABIC]
[Warden!]

01:41.040 --> 01:43.560
[You owe me for seeing you,
this early in the morning.]

01:43.720 --> 01:45.320
[What brings you here?]

01:45.480 --> 01:47.160
[I owe you one.]

01:47.320 --> 01:50.280
[FYI, those are the best
hours of the day.]

01:50.920 --> 01:53.360
[Don't you prefer
to interrogate him here?]

01:53.520 --> 01:54.720
[No one will see him.]

01:55.120 --> 01:57.560
[No, it's okay.
I'll do it in my facility.]

01:57.720 --> 02:00.620
[In two hours we'll know who he is
and where he's from.]

02:00.780 --> 02:03.760
[Well, I'll send you there
with two armed guards.]

02:03.920 --> 02:06.920
[There's no need.
Just have him handcuffed.]

02:08.080 --> 02:09.080
[Look.]

02:09.600 --> 02:11.760
[He had these in his pockets.]

02:18.200 --> 02:21.320
[Tell your guy
to quit snooping around us,]

02:21.480 --> 02:24.480
[or he really will die
as a Shahid next time.]

02:30.320 --> 02:34.040
[If you knew about it, why
didn't you tell me before I got here?]

02:34.480 --> 02:36.080
[I didn't know.]

03:04.080 --> 03:06.000
Give me the red cell phone.

03:06.760 --> 03:08.920
Do you realize that you're insane?
What do you think you're doing?

03:09.080 --> 03:11.440
I'm one phone call away
from finishing Abu Ahmad.

03:11.600 --> 03:13.920
Not when the Defense Minister
is having you arrested!

03:14.080 --> 03:17.840
Gabi, I've delved really deep
into The Territories this past week.

03:18.960 --> 03:22.960
-I met Abu Ahmad.
-How exactly?

03:23.520 --> 03:25.760
He recruited me
as his suicide bomber.

03:26.040 --> 03:28.040
You need a psychiatrist,
you're delusional.

03:28.200 --> 03:30.800
Oh, yeah? Then why
did Abu Mahr arrest me?

03:30.960 --> 03:32.880
Why did he arrest me?

03:35.760 --> 03:38.080
He said you volunteered
for a Hamas operation.

03:38.240 --> 03:41.120
There you go.
I hope you brought the red cell phone.

03:41.280 --> 03:43.080
-It's here.
-Good.

03:43.560 --> 03:45.480
Walid Al-Abed
gave it to me.

03:45.640 --> 03:48.200
He's supposed to call and tell me
where they're picking me up.

03:49.200 --> 03:53.200
-Doron, no one will believe that.
-You do.

03:56.040 --> 03:59.520
Everyone knows that Abu Ahmad meets
with his martyrs before an attack.

03:59.760 --> 04:03.320
What's your plan?
To blow yourself up with him?

04:52.720 --> 04:55.360
Welcome to your luxury suite, sir.

04:56.720 --> 05:00.880
You can order room service,
back rubs, courtesy of Gideon Avital.

05:01.080 --> 05:03.920
You can also try to escape,
but you'll be shot.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.360
I guess a tip is
out of the question, huh?

05:07.520 --> 05:09.160
What do you say?

05:10.240 --> 05:11.840
What do I say?

05:12.000 --> 05:16.480
I say that trying out as a Hamas
suicide bomber - no one made it this far.

05:17.080 --> 05:19.440
Neither our unit,
nor the Mossad or anywhere else.

05:19.600 --> 05:21.760
It's worthless without the cell phone.

05:22.400 --> 05:24.660
Your phone is in good hands,
relax.

05:24.820 --> 05:28.520
-Gabi, let me finish the job.
-I'll see what I can do.

05:28.680 --> 05:31.440
In the meantime, rest,
take a shower, order movies.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.160
[Go play with yourself.]

05:33.440 --> 05:35.000
Here you go.

07:05.680 --> 07:08.920
[-Taufiq.]
[-Abu Halil.]

07:13.160 --> 07:14.960
[Taufiq, my friend.]

07:16.040 --> 07:17.240
[How are you?]

07:17.400 --> 07:19.560
[Praise God. And you?]

07:20.800 --> 07:22.960
[Abu Halil is back
from the cold.]

07:23.120 --> 07:25.840
[Are you kidding? Temperatures
in Amman reach 104 degrees.]

07:26.000 --> 07:27.820
[You can hardly breathe there.]

07:27.980 --> 07:29.560
[Did they give you
a hard time at the border?]

07:29.720 --> 07:31.840
[No, praise God,
it went smoothly.]

07:32.000 --> 07:36.960
[What I don't get is,
why they didn't suspect me.]

07:37.120 --> 07:38.360
[Thank God they didn't.]

07:38.520 --> 07:42.080
[Those damn Jews shoot judges too,
not just children.]

07:43.160 --> 07:45.000
[Praise God.]

08:01.160 --> 08:05.160
[Guard this with extra care.]

08:05.520 --> 08:07.860
[Think carefully
before you use it.]

08:08.020 --> 08:11.360
[It's best
if you didn't use it at all.]

08:11.600 --> 08:13.040
[Don't worry, Abu Halil.]

08:13.200 --> 08:15.080
[It's all calculated.]

08:16.400 --> 08:19.960
[Thank you for your help,
Abu Halil.]

08:20.200 --> 08:23.160
[-Thank you.]
[-With all my love, brother.]

08:23.320 --> 08:25.800
[You remind me of
when I was young,]

08:25.960 --> 08:29.640
[my delightful youth,
before I started the business.]

08:29.800 --> 08:34.320
[That's why I only trust family.
I trust no one else, Abu Halil.]

08:34.480 --> 08:36.200
[Speaking of family,]

08:37.000 --> 08:39.800
[the leaders in Amman
asked that I give you this.]

08:39.960 --> 08:41.800
[That's all? Where's the rest?]

08:41.960 --> 08:43.920
[That's what they gave me.]

08:45.640 --> 08:48.860
[I guess our friends in Amman
forgot that we're suffering here.]

08:49.020 --> 08:50.840
[They haven't forgotten.]

08:51.000 --> 08:53.640
[They know full well
how much you sacrifice.]

08:57.040 --> 08:58.000
[Abu Halil.]

08:58.160 --> 08:59.880
[-Well well!]
[-How are you?]

09:00.040 --> 09:02.240
[My dear Walid.]

09:02.400 --> 09:05.360
[-When did you get back?]
[-Just now.]

09:05.520 --> 09:07.480
[-How have you been?]
[-Fine, thank God.]

09:07.640 --> 09:09.320
[Do you still stutter?]

09:10.360 --> 09:13.120
[As a kid,
he didn't speak a word.]

09:13.280 --> 09:15.160
[Not a single word.]

09:15.320 --> 09:17.280
[I thought he was a mute.]

09:19.160 --> 09:20.920
[What is it?]

09:21.520 --> 09:23.040
[I couldn't find her.]

09:23.400 --> 09:25.040
[I'll find her, don't worry.]

09:41.840 --> 09:43.800
It's a once in a lifetime shot,
no one has ever gone this deep.

09:43.960 --> 09:45.800
He could call any minute,
do you know that?

09:45.960 --> 09:48.320
And what's to guarantee that
Abu Ahmad would meet with Doron?

09:48.480 --> 09:51.120
Abu Ahmad always meets
with his bombers before an attack.

09:51.280 --> 09:53.800
He never passed it up
even when we were on his tail.

09:53.960 --> 09:55.960
Gabi, you're no fool
and neither is he.

09:56.120 --> 09:59.040
I'm fed up with that phantom
and his mutinous acts.

09:59.200 --> 10:02.260
Me too, but he's in,
it's a fact, so let's use that.

10:02.420 --> 10:05.920
-Are you trying to finish me?
-It could help us all, even you.

10:06.080 --> 10:08.840
I won't risk the system
for some crazy adventure, Gabi.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.240
The only one at risk is Doron Kabilio,
and he's willing to go for it.

10:12.400 --> 10:15.320
The only place Doron Kabilio will go to
is prison.

10:15.480 --> 10:16.720
After the operation.

10:16.880 --> 10:20.040
There is no operation,
aren't you listening to me?!

10:21.880 --> 10:25.440
I'm pulling the plug
on this guy's shenanigans.

11:24.200 --> 11:25.880
What are you doing here?

11:29.120 --> 11:30.800
You disappeared on me.

11:38.360 --> 11:40.400
I can't live without you.

11:46.880 --> 11:49.440
I mean it, Gali,
I'm going crazy here.

12:52.080 --> 12:54.840
[Well... Is this good?]

12:55.920 --> 12:58.080
[Should I get you some more?]

13:22.760 --> 13:26.080
[This was behind the door
that you were supposed to break.]

13:38.480 --> 13:41.480
[Still don't believe that your cousin
is in cahoots with the Jews?]

13:41.760 --> 13:43.520
[She's a collaborator.]

13:43.680 --> 13:44.800
[We don't know who did that.]

13:44.960 --> 13:46.800
[Oh, must've been burglars
inside the house.]

13:46.960 --> 13:49.720
[-Maybe Abu Samara did it.]
[-Or you!]

13:50.440 --> 13:51.700
[-Me?]
[-Yes.]

13:51.860 --> 13:53.160
[-Are you suspecting me?!]
[-Yes!]

13:53.320 --> 13:56.760
[They got your cousin on their side,
perhaps your entire family, too.]

13:56.920 --> 13:59.040
[-You think I'm a collaborator?]
[-Yes!]

13:59.880 --> 14:01.840
[Stop defending her.]

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
[She just got back from France,
what do you know about her?]

14:04.160 --> 14:05.840
[Everything.
I've known her all my life.]

14:06.000 --> 14:09.920
[What if she had connections with
the damn Jews back in France?]

14:10.080 --> 14:11.760
[How would you know?!]

14:19.160 --> 14:20.920
[Where is she?]

14:21.240 --> 14:24.240
[I don't know. I'll find her.]

14:25.000 --> 14:28.560
[I'll leave no stone unturned.
She's a disgrace to our family.]

14:28.720 --> 14:31.880
[Walid,
be a man and a Palestinian fighter.]

14:32.040 --> 14:35.200
[Clear your name by killing her
with your own bare hands.]

14:35.920 --> 14:37.000
[Understood?]

14:58.640 --> 15:00.520
[Shirin, open up.]

15:02.000 --> 15:05.360
[-Open the door before I kick it in.]
[-Hold on.]

15:40.280 --> 15:42.080
[We were in your apartment.]

15:42.760 --> 15:44.120
[And?]

15:44.280 --> 15:46.480
[You left quite a mess there.]

15:46.760 --> 15:49.040
[They tried to kill me.]

15:49.200 --> 15:51.160
[Why do you need
Amir Mahajne?]

15:52.680 --> 15:56.440
[-What do you want from me?]
[-Abu Ahmad sent me.]

15:57.960 --> 16:00.000
[Are you here to kill me?]

16:20.360 --> 16:24.800
[As a kid, I'd wait for you to fly back
from Paris for the holidays]

16:24.960 --> 16:27.000
[and take me to the park.]

16:35.080 --> 16:37.000
[I love you.]

16:38.960 --> 16:41.480
[Before you,
I never knew what love is.]

16:43.960 --> 16:47.320
[Walid,
I don't know what to say.]

16:47.480 --> 16:49.320
[You don't have to say anything,
just say "yes".]

16:49.480 --> 16:50.720
[-"Yes"?]
[-Yes.]

16:50.880 --> 16:51.720
[To what?]

16:51.880 --> 16:53.840
[To marrying me.]

16:54.200 --> 16:55.920
[Walid...]

16:56.440 --> 16:59.280
[You don't need guys from the Palestine
Preventive Security to protect you.]

16:59.440 --> 17:01.080
[I will protect you.]

17:01.480 --> 17:05.360
[-It's your only chance to survive.]
[-That's no reason to get married.]

17:05.520 --> 17:09.240
[Looks like a good reason to me.
No one would dare harm my wife.]

17:09.400 --> 17:12.680
[-What about Abu Ahmad?]
[-Not even he. No one.]

17:12.840 --> 17:15.280
[It's not enough.
You're still a kid to him.]

17:15.440 --> 17:17.720
[Stop calling me a kid!]

17:19.920 --> 17:23.920
[Shirin, do you trust me?]

17:25.160 --> 17:27.200
[What do you say?]

17:27.400 --> 17:30.640
[-About what?]
[-About being my wife.]

17:34.760 --> 17:37.360
[-I have to think about it.]
[-Okay.]

17:38.360 --> 17:41.280
[Think about it
as long as you need.]

17:41.440 --> 17:42.960
[Alright.]

18:21.880 --> 18:25.000
Nassrin, the operation
went perfectly.

18:25.280 --> 18:27.120
We need to examine the eye
in a day or two,

18:27.280 --> 18:29.680
but I think it's safe to say
that Abir will be able to see.

18:29.840 --> 18:32.440
Thank you.
Thank you, Doctor.

18:37.520 --> 18:38.840
When can I take her home?

18:39.000 --> 18:41.120
She needs to stay
for three or four days.

18:41.280 --> 18:43.240
-Wow, that long?
-We need to examine,

18:43.400 --> 18:46.440
to see that there is no infection,
that everything works.

18:46.600 --> 18:50.160
If I take her to Nablus Hospital,
can I take her sooner?

18:50.320 --> 18:54.140
Maybe in two days. She shouldn't
move so much before that.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.520
Let's see how she's doing
in two days and then decide.

18:56.680 --> 18:59.600
Thank you. Thank you, Doctor.
Thank you very much.

18:59.760 --> 19:02.920
-You're welcome. All the best.
-Thank you.

19:12.400 --> 19:14.120
[My God...]

19:16.560 --> 19:18.360
[Happy?]

19:19.080 --> 19:20.920
[Praise Allah.]

19:23.040 --> 19:27.440
[You know, you could end
this whole nightmare.]

19:27.960 --> 19:32.360
[You could be living in Berlin, Paris,
wherever you choose,]

19:32.520 --> 19:34.080
[with your children
and Abu Ahmad.]

19:34.240 --> 19:35.720
[Sure...]

19:35.960 --> 19:37.840
[We don't want
your husband here,]

19:38.000 --> 19:41.880
[and if we could arrange
to get him out of here]

19:42.280 --> 19:45.720
[secretly and quietly,
it would be worth it to us.]

19:45.880 --> 19:47.600
[And you'd kill him
the first chance you get.]

19:47.760 --> 19:48.840
[Absolutely not.]

19:49.000 --> 19:52.280
[He wouldn't be the first one
who gets paid to disappear.]

19:54.400 --> 19:56.600
[He'd never go for it.]

19:56.760 --> 19:59.160
[Neither would
your Defense Minister.]

19:59.320 --> 20:01.680
[He already said "yes".]

20:07.880 --> 20:11.160
[He's the father of my children.
I won't turn him in.]

20:13.000 --> 20:15.360
[You want me to turn him in
for my children's sake, right?]

20:15.520 --> 20:17.840
[As if you really care
about them.]

20:18.000 --> 20:20.360
[You know how much
it would weaken him.]

20:20.520 --> 20:24.560
[The poor man moves from
hideout to hideout like a rat.]

20:24.720 --> 20:29.480
[You want us to leave for Berlin
so you could weaken him and kill him.]

20:29.880 --> 20:33.120
[-It's for your children's sake.]
[-Do my children mean that much to you?]

20:33.280 --> 20:36.520
[Please, Captain Ayub,
I'm no fool.]

21:15.960 --> 21:21.440
HAMAS BUREAUS
NORTHERN RAMALLAH

21:30.720 --> 21:32.440
[I'm listening.]

21:35.360 --> 21:37.520
[I've been thinking.]

21:38.960 --> 21:41.800
[The Abu Ahmad of today
isn't the Abu Ahmad of yesterday.]

21:41.960 --> 21:43.040
[Meaning?]

21:44.080 --> 21:46.080
[He should be finished.]

21:47.960 --> 21:50.280
[I won't stand in your way.]

21:52.400 --> 21:55.400
[I'll tell you when and where,
and you'll catch him.]

21:56.880 --> 22:00.120
[It's important that you do it
with your own hands.]

22:00.480 --> 22:03.240
[You're the only one
who can get near him.]

22:03.400 --> 22:07.000
[Put a bullet through his brain
and make sure he's dead,]

22:07.160 --> 22:11.080
[so that we end his
miraculous "resurrections".]

22:11.240 --> 22:14.000
[-You expect me to kill him?!]
[-Who then?]

22:15.040 --> 22:18.240
[-But I can't--]
[-Walid.]

22:18.640 --> 22:21.240
[I won't do your work for you.]

22:22.280 --> 22:24.920
[You're the only one
who can come near him.]

22:25.200 --> 22:27.080
[Quietly.]

22:27.240 --> 22:29.120
[Without being noticed.]

22:34.560 --> 22:36.280
[Take this.]

22:36.440 --> 22:38.880
[An Israeli soldier sold it to us.]

22:40.920 --> 22:42.720
[Are you with me?]

22:43.200 --> 22:45.680
[Say that the house
was under attack]

22:45.840 --> 22:47.600
[and that you managed
to get away,]

22:47.760 --> 22:51.360
[but he wasn't as lucky,
and that the IDF killed him.]

22:55.040 --> 22:57.320
[It'll be our secret]

22:57.480 --> 22:59.920
[and we'll take it to our graves.]

23:01.720 --> 23:03.760
[I know.]

23:04.200 --> 23:06.520
[Abu Ahmad was a hero
to all of us,]

23:06.760 --> 23:09.400
[but his prestige is being
diminished by his conduct.]

23:09.560 --> 23:11.920
[He leaves us no choice.]

23:12.080 --> 23:14.840
[-But I can't do it.]
[-Why not?]

23:15.160 --> 23:18.560
[You know what?
Think of it this way:]

23:19.160 --> 23:21.400
[You would be doing him a favor.]

23:21.560 --> 23:23.640
[If he lives, he would be making
a fool of himself,]

23:23.800 --> 23:28.080
[but if he dies
while we're at war with the Jews...]

23:30.240 --> 23:32.400
[...his name won't be tarnished.]

24:12.280 --> 24:14.000
[What is it, Abu Amir?]

24:21.440 --> 24:22.400
[Hello?]

24:22.560 --> 24:24.560
[-Are you alone?]
[-Yes.]

24:24.720 --> 24:26.960
[My darling.
How is she?]

24:27.120 --> 24:29.200
She's in recovery.

24:30.200 --> 24:32.920
[The doctor said
she's a very lucky girl.]

24:33.080 --> 24:35.080
[Her eye was completely saved.]

24:35.240 --> 24:37.040
[God bless her doctor.]

24:37.200 --> 24:39.120
[When will you be back?]

24:39.320 --> 24:41.120
[I don't know.]

24:42.360 --> 24:45.760
[Nassrin, we need to talk.]

24:45.920 --> 24:47.440
[I can explain what happened.]

24:47.600 --> 24:49.680
[I don't want
any explanations now.]

24:49.840 --> 24:53.600
[-I just want my daughter to recover.]
[-Of course, God willing.]

24:54.240 --> 24:56.840
[I miss her and Ahmad.]

24:57.200 --> 24:59.040
[And I miss you too.]

25:01.640 --> 25:03.120
[God willing.]

25:06.280 --> 25:09.440
[-I'm going home.]
[-Sure thing.]

25:09.600 --> 25:11.240
[As soon as you can,
of course.]

25:11.400 --> 25:15.120
[I'm going back to Berlin
with the children.]

25:15.280 --> 25:17.200
[What?]

25:17.680 --> 25:19.440
[What do you mean?]

25:20.080 --> 25:24.840
[I can't take this anymore.]

25:25.440 --> 25:28.480
[This time Abir was lucky, but who
knows what will be next time?]

25:28.640 --> 25:30.520
[Nassrin, but we're a family.]

25:30.680 --> 25:33.400
[You can't just decide that
on your own. We'll talk.]

25:33.560 --> 25:37.480
[My children deserve to live a normal life
and that won't be possible here.]

25:37.640 --> 25:40.240
[I never had a normal life,
but I've dedicated my life]

25:40.400 --> 25:43.680
[-to give my children a chance at normalcy.]
[-I know you have,]

25:43.840 --> 25:47.520
[and I truly appreciate and respect
what you're doing,]

25:49.720 --> 25:52.800
[but you've put me
in a tough spot.]

25:53.160 --> 25:56.920
[I'm supposed to choose between
your life and my children's lives.]

25:58.120 --> 26:02.800
[Nassrin, please, I beg you.]

26:02.960 --> 26:07.280
[You've forgotten about us.
You've abandoned your children,]

26:07.440 --> 26:10.000
[you were willing to sacrifice Abir.
Don't you realize that?]

26:10.160 --> 26:14.040
[Nassrin, please,
let's just meet for five minutes.]

26:15.560 --> 26:17.200
[Alright.]

26:17.800 --> 26:20.040
[But it has to be
as soon as possible.]

26:20.200 --> 26:22.240
[Fine.
Take the phone with you.]

26:22.400 --> 26:25.860
[When you leave the hospital,
one of my men will tell you where to go.]

26:26.020 --> 26:27.520
[Okay.]

26:46.560 --> 26:48.840
[Allahu Akbar.]

26:55.920 --> 26:58.680
<i>[May the exalted Allah</i>
<i>receive my prayers]</i>

26:59.280 --> 27:06.240
<i>[May the merciful Allah</i>
<i>bring peace upon us all.]</i>

27:08.760 --> 27:10.360
[Did you find her?]

27:10.520 --> 27:12.160
[No.]

27:17.200 --> 27:19.000
[I'll be right there.]

27:23.640 --> 27:25.600
[You hear, Walid?]

27:27.200 --> 27:30.120
[One day,
the Jews will catch me.]

27:30.280 --> 27:32.880
[They're getting
closer and closer.]

27:34.760 --> 27:36.600
[If not them,
it will be Abu Samara.]

27:37.400 --> 27:41.080
[And if not Abu Samara,
then it'll be one of my men.]

27:42.640 --> 27:46.160
[I want you to be prepared
to replace me.]

27:47.320 --> 27:50.240
[You don't know
how hard it is to be me.]

28:07.400 --> 28:11.680
[Walid, you are like a son to me.
You know that.]

28:17.040 --> 28:18.960
[Do you know what this is?]

28:20.800 --> 28:22.560
[What is it?]

28:23.840 --> 28:27.400
[It's what the chosen one
will take with him tomorrow.]

28:27.560 --> 28:31.440
[Abu Samara and his cowardly friends
will never see it coming.]

28:31.600 --> 28:34.360
[-But what is it?]
[-You'll know soon enough.]

28:34.840 --> 28:37.120
[You know that I never
keep anything from you,]

28:37.280 --> 28:40.200
[but this time
it's for your own good.]

28:46.120 --> 28:48.920
[I want you to trust me
completely.]

28:49.200 --> 28:51.080
[Okay?]

28:58.360 --> 29:00.840
I'm not eating,
I'm chewing gum.

29:01.040 --> 29:03.480
So go tell Mom.
Good thing we're divorced.

29:03.640 --> 29:05.960
Too bad you can't divorce her,
that's true.

29:06.520 --> 29:08.920
No, I'll be there
at around 9 p.m.

29:09.920 --> 29:11.480
Gotta go.

29:18.920 --> 29:20.560
[Hello?]

29:20.720 --> 29:24.440
[-Samah?]
[-No, I'm his brother. Samah isn't here.]

29:24.600 --> 29:26.720
[He left this phone with me.
Who is it?]

29:26.960 --> 29:28.760
[When will he be back?]

29:32.080 --> 29:34.400
[In an hour.]

29:37.680 --> 29:40.800
[I'll call again in an hour.]

29:40.960 --> 29:42.560
[Alright.]

29:47.160 --> 29:51.160
Why an hour? I'm such an idiot,
why didn't I say "two hours"?

30:37.720 --> 30:39.720
I'm your brother.

30:40.960 --> 30:42.320
What?

30:43.320 --> 30:47.000
I told the guy on the phone that
I'm your brother, so if he asks--

30:59.920 --> 31:01.840
Yiftah, what's up?

31:02.920 --> 31:05.760
No, there's a lamb chop
and rice in the fridge.

31:05.920 --> 31:09.040
But don't warm it up
in the microwave oven, okay?

31:09.200 --> 31:12.520
You can microwave the rice,
but warm the lamb chop in a pan.

31:12.880 --> 31:15.400
I know, you've got
basketball practice at 6:30 p.m.

31:17.320 --> 31:19.400
It doesn't matter
if he's taller than you,

31:19.560 --> 31:22.560
if you push him with your butt,
he'll miss the hoop.

31:23.520 --> 31:25.400
Okay, buddy,
I gotta go.

31:25.560 --> 31:28.960
Oh, and don't put ketchup on it,
or I'll kill you.

31:29.480 --> 31:31.280
Bye, Yiftah, buddy.

32:01.680 --> 32:03.440
Hello?

32:06.160 --> 32:07.800
[I'm Samah.]

32:10.520 --> 32:13.040
I'm sorry,
it won't happen again.

32:14.480 --> 32:18.960
[Do you understand that you
must follow our exact orders?]

32:19.960 --> 32:22.920
[I do, I apologize.]

32:23.240 --> 32:24.840
[No problem.]

32:25.000 --> 32:26.560
[Now, listen carefully.]

32:26.720 --> 32:29.680
[Tomorrow at 10 a.m,
be at the old market in Beitunia.]

32:29.920 --> 32:33.080
[Wait there, someone will pick you up.
Understood?]

32:33.240 --> 32:34.640
[Understood.]

32:34.800 --> 32:36.960
[Don't say your goodbyes
to anyone.]

32:37.120 --> 32:40.720
[-Don't do anything out of the ordinary.]
[-Okay.]

32:42.640 --> 32:44.400
[May Allah be with you.]

32:44.800 --> 32:46.200
[Goodbye.]

32:55.880 --> 32:59.280
If you're having second thoughts,
now is the time to call it off.
