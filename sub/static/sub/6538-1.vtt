01:27.418 --> 01:29.646
How's everybody feeling?

01:34.256 --> 01:37.969
Now, if you would like to wander,
please feel free to do so...

01:38.069 --> 01:43.163
but be very careful for potholes
and snakes that may occur anywhere.

01:43.263 --> 01:47.017
And any other areas, like the fuselage
areas, please be careful,

01:47.117 --> 01:49.030
but by all means go ahead and wander.

04:50.105 --> 04:51.974
What's the difference...
what's the difference

04:52.074 --> 04:57.137
between Courtney Love
and the American flag?

04:58.545 --> 05:03.242
It would be wrong to urinate
on the American flag.

05:07.597 --> 05:09.186
Yeah.

05:09.286 --> 05:14.449
What do you get... what do you get
when you cross Sir Elton John

05:14.549 --> 05:17.419
with a saber tooth tiger?

05:18.893 --> 05:23.357
I don't know, but you better
keep it away from your ass!

05:28.835 --> 05:31.816
All right, so this is a fun crowd.

05:33.405 --> 05:36.734
We got some other gags here, gang.

05:37.808 --> 05:39.976
Why don't rapists...

05:40.076 --> 05:46.308
why don't rapists eat at T.G.I. Friday's?

05:47.816 --> 05:52.164
Well, it's hard to go out and rape
when you have a stomach ache.

05:53.653 --> 05:56.415
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

06:16.239 --> 06:20.693
Can you answer for me,
did this used to be a Days Inn?

06:20.975 --> 06:25.864
- I really don't know.
- 'Cause I was swearing I was here...

06:27.548 --> 06:32.278
in 2005 or something,
and it was a Days Inn.

06:43.728 --> 06:46.464
Hi, sweetheart. It's Daddy.

06:46.864 --> 06:51.068
I'm in the desert, and it's beautiful.

06:51.168 --> 06:55.205
It's hot, but... but it's beautiful.

06:55.305 --> 06:56.909
And... today

06:57.009 --> 07:02.210
I took a tour of an airplane graveyard
they have out here,

07:02.410 --> 07:05.447
and they got every plane you can think of:

07:05.547 --> 07:09.450
737, 747, jumbo jets.

07:09.550 --> 07:13.970
And you just walk right into the planes.

07:14.786 --> 07:16.532
And...

07:20.257 --> 07:22.095
I...

07:23.084 --> 07:27.598
I will talk to you again soon. Good night.

12:09.371 --> 12:11.191
Why...

12:12.140 --> 12:14.142
Why...

12:14.485 --> 12:20.256
Why did Madonna feed her infant baby
Alpo brand dog food?

12:21.681 --> 12:26.085
Well, she had no choice,
that's just what came out of her breasts.

12:26.886 --> 12:28.699
Yeah.

12:29.153 --> 12:32.341
Okay, so this is a fun crowd.

12:42.499 --> 12:44.352
Why...

12:45.568 --> 12:48.739
Why did E.T., the Extra Terrestrial,

12:48.839 --> 12:52.192
love Reese's Pieces so much?

12:53.442 --> 12:58.576
Well, because they have the same flavor
that cum does on his home planet.

13:00.081 --> 13:02.022
Yeah, right.

13:03.284 --> 13:05.251
Why...

13:05.501 --> 13:08.187
Why did God...

13:09.053 --> 13:12.574
let John Denver die?

13:13.189 --> 13:15.443
Because you suck.

13:16.490 --> 13:19.094
- Come on.
- How we doin' for time?

13:19.194 --> 13:21.200
Time's up.

13:22.829 --> 13:25.899
It's a rhetorical question weirdo.

13:26.599 --> 13:28.940
Speak your complaints into a man's penis,

13:29.040 --> 13:33.906
not into thin air, because I'll tell ya,
these hardworking imbeciles here

13:34.006 --> 13:38.276
that paid their money to come here
and forget their problems for one night,

13:38.376 --> 13:43.580
laugh their fool heads off,
and they didn't pay to listen to you...

13:44.080 --> 13:47.649
and your garbage talk.
You're not a professional comedian.

13:47.749 --> 13:49.918
You're a professional loser.

13:50.018 --> 13:53.887
You're a professional fatso!
What's your problem?

13:54.087 --> 13:57.915
Jesus Christ, can't you just
sit there with a smile

13:58.015 --> 14:01.185
splattered on your stupid face.

14:01.285 --> 14:05.280
Laugh your fool head off,
but shut your fool mouth!

14:05.629 --> 14:07.565
- Neil!
- Hey.

14:07.665 --> 14:09.860
- Cousin John.
- Hi, John.

14:09.960 --> 14:12.186
- How ya doin'?
- Good.

14:12.286 --> 14:14.420
I made it out.

14:14.769 --> 14:18.942
It was great. Really great stuff. Funny.

14:19.042 --> 14:21.787
Thanks for coming to the show.

14:21.887 --> 14:24.314
Yeah, I was like...

14:24.414 --> 14:27.130
this'll... this'll shock 'em.

14:28.380 --> 14:30.215
Yep.

14:30.315 --> 14:32.750
I don't know how you remember
all that stuff.

14:32.850 --> 14:35.802
Yeah, it's a lot of stuff.

14:37.919 --> 14:40.489
If it was me, I'd just be...

14:41.233 --> 14:43.108
Yeah.

14:48.028 --> 14:52.331
That one guy, he was out of line.
That was...

14:52.431 --> 14:56.000
Yeah, they should... they should have
security or something to take him out

14:56.100 --> 14:59.270
because it just makes it hard
for me to do my job.

14:59.370 --> 15:00.504
- Exactly.
- It makes it...

15:00.604 --> 15:02.872
People are paying money
for me to do my job

15:02.972 --> 15:05.107
and then he does that and then it just...

15:05.207 --> 15:07.474
- It just ruins the night for everyone.
- Yeah.

15:07.574 --> 15:11.207
You know, it's...
just doin' my job, you know.

15:11.307 --> 15:13.747
Right. You're out there,
you're doin' your job.

15:13.847 --> 15:17.016
Just trying to make
a nice night for people.

15:17.116 --> 15:21.009
Yeah. You're the star,
he's in the audience. So just...

15:21.109 --> 15:24.729
- You shut him up good thought.
- Yeah. Well...

15:24.829 --> 15:27.691
he's just a drunk, you know?

15:27.791 --> 15:32.994
That's a lot... that's... that's what
we do in this business really is sell...

15:33.094 --> 15:35.363
we're selling alcohol, you know.

15:35.463 --> 15:38.099
That's why they will book me
in a place like this

15:38.199 --> 15:40.067
is to sell more alcohol, you know.

15:40.167 --> 15:43.219
They should have a... they should
have security and take him out,

15:43.319 --> 15:47.908
but they don't have security,
then I have to be the security

15:48.008 --> 15:51.354
and try to get them to leave, you know?
Which shouldn't... It's not part of my job,

15:51.454 --> 15:55.946
but it's become part of my job,
so, you know.

15:56.046 --> 15:58.314
It shouldn't be my job at all.

15:58.414 --> 16:00.115
Right.

16:00.215 --> 16:02.418
It is a customer service thing,
though, you know.

16:02.518 --> 16:05.587
Like, these people are here,
they're payin',

16:05.687 --> 16:07.657
if you weird us out too much...

16:07.757 --> 16:10.825
I mean, I loved it, I thought
it was very funny, it was great.

16:10.925 --> 16:13.211
You're up there,
puttin' yourself out there, but...

16:13.311 --> 16:16.829
I mean, from a business point of view,
if you want my... that's what I do,

16:16.929 --> 16:20.464
I consult about business, and...

16:20.564 --> 16:25.001
and for you, I'd say a strategy
would be consider...

16:25.101 --> 16:29.539
a little less of the weird stuff,
like "semen," that...

16:29.639 --> 16:34.226
Some of the people were like...
"Did he just say semen?"

16:34.808 --> 16:36.809
But others liked it, so...

16:36.909 --> 16:39.312
Yeah, I don't care.
Like I said, I thought it was great.

16:39.412 --> 16:41.679
You're up there,
you're puttin' yourself out...

16:41.779 --> 16:43.152
Yeah.

16:43.252 --> 16:46.633
Yeah, if you wanna appeal to, like...

16:46.748 --> 16:49.306
all four quadrants, you know, like...

16:49.406 --> 16:53.137
all the different groups...
age groups... you know...

16:53.953 --> 16:58.809
"semen" and all that is a little bit much.

17:03.895 --> 17:06.547
Hello, sweetheart. It's Daddy.

17:06.646 --> 17:10.645
Just... checking in.

17:12.465 --> 17:14.334
You're probably asleep.

17:14.434 --> 17:17.133
It's pretty late, but I...

17:17.233 --> 17:20.355
got out of the club pretty late so...

17:20.972 --> 17:24.709
But... yeah, everything's going great.

17:25.309 --> 17:30.355
So I just wanted to...

17:31.480 --> 17:35.183
to check in with you and...

17:35.283 --> 17:39.397
I'll check in again. And...

17:46.624 --> 17:49.077
Talk to ya later.

18:05.175 --> 18:07.745
Welcome to California oil country.

18:07.845 --> 18:12.882
California started producing oil in 1876.

18:12.982 --> 18:17.819
We have produced about 28
and a half billion barrels

18:17.919 --> 18:19.220
of oil since.

18:19.320 --> 18:23.290
Visualize asphalt and the oil is stuck

18:23.390 --> 18:27.292
between the little grains
of sand and gravel, okay?

18:27.392 --> 18:29.577
So, if you...

18:29.677 --> 18:33.498
See we're not exactly in the Garden
of Eden here, you know,

18:33.598 --> 18:38.027
but you've gotta go where the oil is,
and Kern County...

18:38.127 --> 18:40.251
because of its...

18:40.351 --> 18:45.566
you know, archaeological past,
happens to have 70...

18:45.666 --> 18:52.061
oil fields just within an area near
the size of Massachusetts.

18:52.161 --> 18:55.247
And, of course,
if this looks familiar to you,

18:55.347 --> 19:00.185
it may be because in 1970
they filmed Five Easy Pieces

19:00.285 --> 19:04.421
with Jack Nicholson
and Karen Black out in this area.

19:04.521 --> 19:10.126
Now, I'm not much of an impersonator,
but the classic... line is in the diner.

19:10.226 --> 19:13.529
I don't know if you remember
it or not, but he says,

19:13.629 --> 19:18.133
"All right, let me make
this easy for ya, okay?

19:18.233 --> 19:22.001
I want an omelet, plain,

19:22.101 --> 19:25.371
and a chicken salad sandwich
on wheat toast.

19:25.471 --> 19:28.957
Now, no butter, no mayo,

19:29.057 --> 19:32.476
no lettuce, and a cup of coffee.

19:32.576 --> 19:35.929
Now, hold the chicken."

21:34.873 --> 21:37.460
Like that, what I just did?

21:40.510 --> 21:42.765
Was it funny?

21:42.865 --> 21:45.368
You like fuckin' clowns?

21:48.501 --> 21:51.623
Yeah, you like fuckin' clowns,
look at that hair.

22:00.345 --> 22:02.780
Well, that was more than I expected.

22:02.880 --> 22:07.447
- Oh, yeah?
- Yep. Crowd was a little dry.

22:07.547 --> 22:09.602
- But...
- All right.

22:22.295 --> 22:24.175
Sorry.

22:27.933 --> 22:30.067
You're lucky.

22:30.167 --> 22:32.020
All you got's glasses.

22:43.244 --> 22:47.642
Why did Carrot Top, legendary, legendary,

22:47.742 --> 22:51.785
legendary Vegas comedian Carrot Top,

22:51.985 --> 22:55.721
prop comedian Carrot Top,

22:55.821 --> 23:01.192
legendary prop comedian Carrot Top,

23:01.292 --> 23:07.348
legendary Vegas prop comedian
Carrot Top...

23:12.001 --> 23:14.537
Why did Carrot Top,

23:14.637 --> 23:18.723
legendary Carrot Top...

23:19.372 --> 23:21.473
refuse,

23:21.573 --> 23:24.675
absolutely refuse...

23:24.775 --> 23:27.111
the pleading requests...

23:27.211 --> 23:32.581
of the topless Playboy playmate...

23:32.681 --> 23:36.635
who was naked in the jacuzzi with him?

23:38.252 --> 23:43.340
Because she was begging him
to shoot himself in the head.

23:48.894 --> 23:51.587
I'm just trying to earn a living. Come on.

23:51.687 --> 23:54.433
People, these are...
these are great jokes.

23:54.533 --> 23:57.803
We traveled a long distance
carrying these jokes

23:57.903 --> 24:02.240
in order to bring them here
and thrust them into your fool faces.

24:02.340 --> 24:06.177
So sit there and paste a smile
on your face and have some fun.

24:06.277 --> 24:08.979
That's what it's all about, folks,
having fun,

24:09.079 --> 24:13.881
forgetting your problems. And you people
have a lot of problems, I can tell.

24:13.981 --> 24:16.784
Forget 'em just for a few moments
and just laugh with me.

24:16.884 --> 24:18.452
We're gonna have so much fun.

24:18.552 --> 24:23.122
This is a great group of friends here.
My new friends here tonight.

24:28.525 --> 24:30.593
Okay, perfect. Thank you.

24:30.693 --> 24:33.113
Thanks for coming to the show.

24:37.799 --> 24:40.401
Great show, by the way.
You are really hilarious.

24:40.501 --> 24:42.044
Thank you.

24:44.993 --> 24:48.541
I don't know how to tell you this.
That hotel room didn't work out,

24:48.641 --> 24:52.662
but I did talk to my cousin, Alejandro,
he said he'd be willing to take you in.

25:00.085 --> 25:02.419
You talkin' to me?

25:02.819 --> 25:05.239
You talkin' to me?

25:05.521 --> 25:07.689
You talkin' to me?

25:07.789 --> 25:10.257
- Robert De Niro!
- Yeah.

25:10.957 --> 25:13.794
- Fly, you pelican, fly!
- Scarface.

25:13.894 --> 25:17.229
- Yeah, Scarface.
- Now, you go.

25:17.329 --> 25:20.031
He wants you to do an impression.

25:20.131 --> 25:21.917
No.

25:46.189 --> 25:48.996
- <i>Dónde está María?</i>
- <i>No sé.</i>

25:49.096 --> 25:51.662
<i>Esa pinche niña.</i>

26:16.481 --> 26:18.201
Hi.

27:53.406 --> 27:55.226
Hello?

27:57.375 --> 27:59.345
They pulled gold out of here.

27:59.445 --> 28:01.680
They pulled silver,

28:01.780 --> 28:05.082
tungsten, nickel...

28:05.182 --> 28:06.983
copper.

28:07.083 --> 28:10.286
Everything comes either directly
or indirectly from the soil,

28:10.386 --> 28:13.967
as you can look around you,
there certainly is plenty of it.

28:23.031 --> 28:25.551
<i>Hi, sweetheart.</i>

28:27.067 --> 28:31.590
<i>This is just really difficult
to get ahold of you.</i>

28:32.906 --> 28:36.294
<i>I just had to call and tell you...</i>

28:39.345 --> 28:41.698
<i>Sweet dreams.</i>

29:56.318 --> 29:58.487
If nature was gonna grow an orange, Neil,

29:58.587 --> 30:02.757
she would just make it just enough meat,
that's what we call this,

30:02.857 --> 30:06.427
just to fertilize the seed
once it falls, but man,

30:06.527 --> 30:11.113
we want all this sweet meat, so we
pump it full of fertilizer and water.

30:11.463 --> 30:13.399
- You want this?
- No, that's all right.

30:13.499 --> 30:15.884
I can't eat these either.

30:35.385 --> 30:39.756
Hey, did you... see that guy
I was walking around here with?

30:39.856 --> 30:41.590
<i>No. No entiendo.</i>

30:41.690 --> 30:44.578
- I was walking around with a guy.
- <i>No entiendo.</i>

30:44.678 --> 30:49.730
<i>Pero esta es la útima naranja
de la cosecha de este año. Mira.</i>

31:31.037 --> 31:35.525
I got a couple places in town,
do great burgers.

31:37.542 --> 31:41.044
One of them is a bar that serves burgers
and one's just a restaurant.

31:41.144 --> 31:43.430
We need to get a beer.

31:53.520 --> 31:56.357
The foothills off to the left,
you see they start there?

31:56.457 --> 31:59.426
They start to the west
and they come across here?

31:59.526 --> 32:01.561
That's my property,
butts right up against that,

32:01.661 --> 32:04.689
the beginning of those hills
behind my house.

32:07.865 --> 32:10.618
- You alive?
- Yeah.

32:11.433 --> 32:15.369
You gotta talk... you gotta talk right
up against the mic or I can't hear you.

32:15.469 --> 32:17.534
- Yeah.
- Okay.

32:31.850 --> 32:35.445
You all right? Watch the legs.

32:38.188 --> 32:40.041
Cool?

32:48.898 --> 32:51.218
Here we go.

32:51.733 --> 32:53.619
Pino Roja.

32:53.719 --> 32:56.872
So if you sleep with Kenny G,
if you go to bed with Kenny G

32:56.972 --> 32:59.007
and he gives you one of... what was it?

32:59.107 --> 33:01.993
And he gives you one of his records...

33:03.575 --> 33:06.178
wait, no. Whatever.

33:06.278 --> 33:09.514
If you sleep with Kenny G...

33:09.614 --> 33:12.750
and he gives you his record, then...

33:12.850 --> 33:15.151
What is it? Tell her.

33:15.251 --> 33:18.120
I don't wanna do it here.

33:18.220 --> 33:21.088
All right, I remember.

33:21.188 --> 33:24.657
What's the worst thing
that just happened to you?

33:24.757 --> 33:27.926
You're stuck with a Kenny G record.

33:28.026 --> 33:30.229
I can't... I can't do it.

33:30.329 --> 33:33.862
- Neil knows how to do it. I...
- It's a little different but...

33:34.382 --> 33:38.608
<i>Dijo del músico Kenny G. Si conoces?</i>

33:38.708 --> 33:40.499
<i>Músico?</i>

33:42.536 --> 33:44.837
Are you gonna tell me?

33:44.937 --> 33:48.173
- I told him about the Kenny G.
- Oh, okay. I just want...

33:48.273 --> 33:51.693
You two guys start talking
and I don't know what you're sayin'.

33:52.542 --> 33:57.381
The real shitty thing about it
was half the place was empty.

33:57.481 --> 34:01.239
I mean, he's tellin' this funny stuff,
some of it weird, you know, but...

34:01.339 --> 34:04.350
a lot of funny stuff, and people weren't
there, you know? That was a shame.

34:04.450 --> 34:08.592
- There were some people there, just...
- No, it pissed me off! I was standing, like,

34:08.692 --> 34:12.025
"What is this?" Empty seats?
Who's bookin' this thing?

34:12.125 --> 34:16.262
I don't know who picked that place for you.
You know that place downtown, The Alley?

34:17.262 --> 34:19.664
- The Alley.
- Dirty. Filthy.

34:19.764 --> 34:22.572
Anyway, you need a business plan
is what I'm sayin', you know?

34:22.672 --> 34:24.536
That's just product you're throwin' away.

34:24.636 --> 34:27.704
If you see an empty seat and you tell
a joke and there's no one in that seat

34:27.804 --> 34:30.040
you're just throwin'
that joke away into that seat.

34:30.139 --> 34:31.741
- Right.
- I wanna make sure

34:31.841 --> 34:35.743
people know before they get there, and if
they don't know and it's still half empty,

34:35.842 --> 34:39.273
I'm gonna give 'em a 2-for-1.
I'm gonna say bring a friend for free.

34:39.373 --> 34:41.231
Excuse me.

34:41.947 --> 34:43.789
<i>Estás bien?</i>

34:43.889 --> 34:45.440
<i>Sí.</i>

34:57.325 --> 35:01.226
I gotta stick around here all the time,
'cause if I leave this one

35:01.326 --> 35:04.880
here in charge of stuff, he starts
making decisions without me,

35:04.980 --> 35:07.066
and then it's her and him talkin' Spanish

35:07.166 --> 35:11.168
and I can't understand what's going on
because, you know, Mexican culture,

35:11.268 --> 35:15.370
the older guy, he's supposed to be
the patriarch or whatever, it's bullshit.

35:15.470 --> 35:18.573
It's my house.
I should be making the decisions.

35:22.905 --> 35:25.161
I'll be right back.

35:35.643 --> 35:38.583
<i>Ése hombre me está matando.</i>

35:38.808 --> 35:40.868
<i>Me está matando.</i>

35:41.274 --> 35:43.120
<i>Mejor...</i>

35:45.722 --> 35:47.727
<i>Un balazo.</i>

35:48.302 --> 35:50.807
<i>Me corto el pescuezo, pero...</i>

35:50.907 --> 35:53.266
<i>Me están matando.</i>

35:55.385 --> 35:57.302
<i>Dos veces, tres veces.</i>

36:33.600 --> 36:37.121
This is all me. Up to that first ridge...

36:38.805 --> 36:41.024
it's all me.

36:41.606 --> 36:43.942
- How's your son?
- My daughter?

36:44.042 --> 36:47.857
Yeah, that's right. Sorry, I knew that.

36:47.957 --> 36:49.446
Yeah.

36:49.546 --> 36:51.949
Yeah, she's really good.
She's doing great.

36:52.049 --> 36:55.035
- What's her name again?
- Maria.

36:55.784 --> 36:58.252
Maria, like after Grandma Maria?

36:58.352 --> 37:01.573
No, after Maria from West Side Story.

37:04.790 --> 37:07.956
What's your game plan?
What's the career plan, where do you...

37:08.056 --> 37:10.060
where do you wanna be?

37:10.160 --> 37:12.128
Where's this leadin' to?

37:12.228 --> 37:16.764
I just wanna keep working,
but we've got...

37:16.864 --> 37:19.899
I mean, where's the growth potential?

37:19.999 --> 37:22.435
I got this call...

37:22.535 --> 37:26.177
yesterday about this...

37:26.277 --> 37:30.308
this party, this kind of private
engagement in Hollywood.

37:30.408 --> 37:33.702
- Really?
- Yeah. At the house of...

37:33.802 --> 37:38.482
a pretty well-known celebrity and he's gonna
have a lot of his celebrity friends there.

37:38.582 --> 37:41.435
- And I'm gonna perform.
- Who's gonna be there?

37:42.553 --> 37:45.328
- Liza Minnelli.
- Liza Minnelli.

37:45.428 --> 37:47.255
- She's Judy Garland's daughter.
- Yep.

37:47.355 --> 37:49.823
Remember? The Wizard of Oz?

37:49.923 --> 37:53.527
I used to... we used to get that...
watch that movie once a year on TV.

37:53.627 --> 37:56.096
It would come on TV and I would sing.

37:56.196 --> 37:58.815
I'd sing that rainbow song.

38:00.031 --> 38:01.850
Loved it.

38:03.666 --> 38:07.623
What was that one
that used to make my mom cry?

38:09.762 --> 38:14.198
<i>Away in a manger</i>

38:14.298 --> 38:19.117
<i>No crib for his bed</i>

38:19.217 --> 38:23.830
<i>The little Lord Jesus</i>

38:24.130 --> 38:28.363
<i>Laid down His sweet head</i>

38:28.463 --> 38:32.780
<i>The stars in the sky</i>

38:33.382 --> 38:37.680
<i>Looked down where He lay</i>

38:37.780 --> 38:44.054
<i>The little Lord Jesus</i>

38:44.154 --> 38:50.534
<i>Asleep in the hay</i>

39:07.361 --> 39:09.714
All right, cuz.

39:10.530 --> 39:12.022
Hey.

39:12.122 --> 39:14.499
It's been great havin' ya here.

39:14.599 --> 39:17.319
You can stay longer if ya want.

39:18.335 --> 39:21.099
I mean, we've got these rooms.

39:22.370 --> 39:24.423
It's just...

39:25.739 --> 39:28.563
good to have you back in my life.

39:29.641 --> 39:32.195
Sorry it's been so long.

39:33.077 --> 39:35.981
You're a good boy, you try your best,

39:36.081 --> 39:40.250
you do this weird show, but it doesn't
matter because you're trying,

39:40.350 --> 39:42.761
you're getting yourself out there
and you're trying to...

39:42.861 --> 39:45.308
tell jokes that make people happy,
that's what's important,

39:45.408 --> 39:47.423
just keep doing it.

39:47.523 --> 39:51.077
Go to bed, go to sleep,
turn off the lights.

40:31.273 --> 40:34.099
Put one in each chamber here...

40:34.399 --> 40:36.202
so when you're ready to go,
just yell, "Pull."

40:36.302 --> 40:38.053
Okay.

40:40.136 --> 40:42.022
Pull!

40:46.374 --> 40:48.227
Pull!

40:56.080 --> 40:58.900
Okay. Pull!

41:03.786 --> 41:05.672
Pull!

41:09.556 --> 41:11.376
Pull.

42:15.418 --> 42:17.641
The color blue.

42:18.753 --> 42:22.641
And he found that it actually
enhances the growth of crops.

42:24.057 --> 42:25.910
Blue.

42:28.394 --> 42:30.214
The throat.

42:35.033 --> 42:36.420
Yellow.

42:38.536 --> 42:41.356
Stomach, liver...

42:43.907 --> 42:45.760
ego.

42:51.312 --> 42:53.965
Green. The heart...

42:54.747 --> 42:56.633
nature.

42:59.783 --> 43:01.569
Red.

43:03.352 --> 43:05.538
Vitality...

43:06.388 --> 43:08.375
energy.

44:18.091 --> 44:20.845
- You all right?
- Yeah.

45:54.618 --> 45:57.405
- Hi.
- Hi.

46:08.030 --> 46:10.050
Thank you.

46:14.769 --> 46:16.922
What do you do?

46:19.639 --> 46:22.293
I have this... this little...

46:23.643 --> 46:28.232
this comedy show that...
I travel around with.

46:43.029 --> 46:46.298
If you don't have a seminar
or something tomorrow afternoon,

46:46.398 --> 46:52.589
I have a show pretty close to here
that we're doing at 2:00.

49:16.876 --> 49:20.613
They are gonna fuck it up,
we gotta get 'em outta here!

49:20.713 --> 49:23.248
Bad news, bad news, buddy.

49:23.348 --> 49:26.384
Hootin' and hollerin'
and laughin' and lovin' life.

49:26.484 --> 49:29.003
Bad news, bad news.

49:50.270 --> 49:53.857
- You all right?
- Yep.

50:10.621 --> 50:14.087
<i>My friends and I...
we really enjoyed your show</i>

50:14.187 --> 50:17.928
<i>and we wanted to know if...
you wanted to make some videos with us.</i>

50:18.028 --> 50:20.826
<i>We do like an online...</i>

50:20.926 --> 50:23.244
<i>blog and we were wondering if you...</i>

50:23.344 --> 50:26.570
<i>you know, might be interested
in something like that.</i>

52:10.934 --> 52:13.610
<i>Hi, sweetheart.</i>

52:14.215 --> 52:17.925
<i>It was a long, long day.</i>

52:22.577 --> 52:25.230
<i>Do you believe in God?</i>

56:24.883 --> 56:27.085
- Hey.
- Hey.

56:27.695 --> 56:32.173
I just wanted to come by and say
thank you for having me along.

56:35.557 --> 56:37.743
It's been great.

56:42.495 --> 56:44.715
Yeah, it's been fun.

56:45.998 --> 56:48.635
Oh, did you get a hotel room yet?

56:48.735 --> 56:50.102
No.

56:50.202 --> 56:53.856
I have two beds, you should just
stay with me, it'll be cheaper.

56:56.940 --> 57:00.710
All right, listen, well, I'll see you
out there. Good luck.

57:00.810 --> 57:02.863
You too.

57:07.481 --> 57:12.419
During his long,
legendary broadcasting career,

57:12.519 --> 57:18.576
what was the number one question
most often asked by Larry King?

57:21.359 --> 57:25.814
"Should I be concerned
about blood in my diarrhea?"

57:28.397 --> 57:32.285
What was Elvis Presley's
worst ever release?

57:34.202 --> 57:38.390
The ejaculation containing Lisa Marie.

57:42.975 --> 57:45.750
That's odd. What's the worst thing,
the worst thing

57:45.850 --> 57:50.616
about being gang raped
by Crosby, Stills and Nash?

57:52.582 --> 57:55.035
No Young.

57:57.086 --> 57:59.712
Oh, boy.

58:00.438 --> 58:03.081
What else do we have here?

58:04.226 --> 58:06.408
And what do you call the creatures,

58:06.508 --> 58:09.780
- the creatures...
- Why don't you just go without me?

58:11.296 --> 58:15.534
Why don't you shut your mouth, little lady?
We're trying to do a show here.

58:15.834 --> 58:19.170
- For real?
- Yeah, for real?

58:19.270 --> 58:22.839
Just shut up so I can do the jokes
and we can all get out of here?

58:23.133 --> 58:26.675
On the outside of the building
it didn't say that we were in hell,

58:26.775 --> 58:30.879
and then the few moments after when
the stink from your syphilis breath,

58:30.979 --> 58:34.828
it started wafting over all
the gentlemen and ladies

58:34.928 --> 58:39.352
who have come out for the show tonight,
excluding yourself, of course.

58:39.452 --> 58:42.488
The minute that the waft of stench...

58:42.588 --> 58:46.525
from the herpes and the syphilis
and the lice that you eat...

58:46.625 --> 58:49.477
the minute that started coming...

58:56.546 --> 58:59.098
You little whore.

58:59.198 --> 59:01.201
What makes you think you can come here

59:01.301 --> 59:04.571
and throw a drink at someone
who's traveled a great distance

59:04.671 --> 59:07.106
to bring laughs to this community?

59:07.206 --> 59:12.181
What the hell's wrong with you?
Mental... mental illness?

59:12.281 --> 59:15.280
Mental... Oh, I guess you didn't
throw the drink, though.

59:15.380 --> 59:17.448
She slipped and the drink fell.

59:17.548 --> 59:22.869
She slipped on all the semen gushing
out of her ass when she stood up?

59:22.969 --> 59:24.454
She slipped on that?

59:24.554 --> 59:27.623
Surprised you didn't break
your chin on the fall,

59:27.723 --> 59:30.092
and then get the semen
into the infected cut.

59:30.192 --> 59:33.912
But you have plenty
of infected cuts already.

59:34.527 --> 59:37.231
The little whore's having a tantrum.

59:37.331 --> 59:39.166
She's having a tantrum.

59:39.266 --> 59:43.403
Oh no, she heard a joke she didn't like.

59:43.503 --> 59:47.637
So now she's gonna cry like a little baby
and throw her poo-poo around.

59:47.737 --> 59:50.905
Get the hell out of here, garbage woman!

59:51.105 --> 59:53.239
You little whore.

59:53.339 --> 59:55.926
You little whore.

59:56.842 --> 01:00:00.363
That took the wind out of my sails,
I'll tell ya.

01:00:01.579 --> 01:00:03.982
Because that's unacceptable behavior.

01:00:04.082 --> 01:00:06.818
When someone travels this great distance

01:00:06.918 --> 01:00:11.021
to bring these jokes for you people,
to bring some joy into your lives,

01:00:11.121 --> 01:00:14.391
and I'm literally
plucking jokes out of my heart

01:00:14.491 --> 01:00:17.577
and thrusting them into your fool faces.

01:00:17.677 --> 01:00:20.079
And to have somebody
do something like that,

01:00:20.179 --> 01:00:24.133
really stinks up the evening,
wouldn't you agree?

01:00:33.054 --> 01:00:35.208
I'm a whore?

01:00:36.157 --> 01:00:38.336
I'm a whore?

01:00:40.994 --> 01:00:44.147
- Fuck.
- How does that feel?

01:01:07.781 --> 01:01:09.467
You okay?

01:01:16.754 --> 01:01:19.608
Can you help me find my glasses?

01:02:03.164 --> 01:02:06.101
They should change the name
of that place to The Sewer Club.

01:02:06.201 --> 01:02:08.268
The sewer...

01:02:08.368 --> 01:02:10.688
The Sewer Club.

01:02:11.237 --> 01:02:14.841
No fuckin' security for the artists.

01:02:15.667 --> 01:02:20.279
You're just on your own.
Somebody stabs you in the eye, fuck you.

01:02:20.379 --> 01:02:23.481
- You're on your own.
- Why don't you take off your fuckin' shoes?

01:02:23.581 --> 01:02:25.482
Why don't they take some
of the money from the drinks

01:02:25.582 --> 01:02:31.704
and use it to buy some security guards
so that we're protected from weirdoes.

01:02:34.689 --> 01:02:37.359
You can't have a fucking nightclub
with no security.

01:02:37.459 --> 01:02:40.262
You can't have people drinking
their fucking brains out

01:02:40.362 --> 01:02:43.665
and then you're stuck there
in the firing line

01:02:43.765 --> 01:02:46.317
of these cocksuckers...

01:02:46.499 --> 01:02:50.320
and meth freak-o drug assholes.

01:02:55.573 --> 01:02:58.861
- Why don't you get some rest?
- Fuck that.

01:03:02.712 --> 01:03:04.965
Fuck you.

01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:12.627
<i>Hi, sweetheart.</i>

01:04:16.146 --> 01:04:18.668
<i>It's okay now.</i>

01:04:19.148 --> 01:04:21.668
<i>Everybody's okay.</i>

01:04:23.418 --> 01:04:26.213
<i>I miss you so much.</i>

01:09:25.703 --> 01:09:28.939
Hey, man. Wait, wait. Sorry, sorry!

01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:32.559
Can I ask you a question?

01:09:34.479 --> 01:09:36.310
I'm sorry, I just...

01:09:36.961 --> 01:09:39.214
I'm Tommy, what's your name?

01:09:40.346 --> 01:09:42.148
Gene.

01:09:42.448 --> 01:09:44.288
Gene?

01:09:44.589 --> 01:09:46.665
Okay, Gene.

01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:50.705
I'm really sorry, I don't mean to make you
uncomfortable or anything.

01:09:54.424 --> 01:09:57.914
My car broke down and I didn't
want to drain the battery and...

01:09:58.014 --> 01:10:00.379
run the engine and something's wrong
with the transmission, I think.

01:10:00.479 --> 01:10:03.765
So I just came in here
because it's warmer in here.

01:10:04.597 --> 01:10:06.816
Don't you think it is?

01:10:09.033 --> 01:10:11.603
Can I come out and stay
in your car and hang out

01:10:11.703 --> 01:10:14.798
until somebody gets here, to stay warm?

01:10:16.305 --> 01:10:20.771
It's better if you stay in here.
It's warmer here.

01:10:21.592 --> 01:10:23.378
Safer.

01:10:25.395 --> 01:10:27.230
In here?

01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:29.399
Yeah.

01:10:30.581 --> 01:10:33.034
Than in your car?

01:10:34.183 --> 01:10:35.969
Yeah.

01:10:37.919 --> 01:10:40.706
Okay, you think it's safer here?

01:10:45.393 --> 01:10:47.146
Okay.

01:10:50.831 --> 01:10:54.402
Will you stay in here with me and keep me
company until someone gets here?

01:12:01.495 --> 01:12:03.715
Hi, sweetheart.

01:12:06.899 --> 01:12:08.935
Remember this?

01:12:09.235 --> 01:12:11.287
Remember this?

01:12:48.370 --> 01:12:50.956
Why?

01:12:52.372 --> 01:12:54.941
Why?

01:12:55.041 --> 01:12:57.494
Why?

01:12:58.176 --> 01:13:00.762
Why?

01:13:03.012 --> 01:13:05.148
Hey, man, you saw...
you know that... you saw that...

01:13:05.248 --> 01:13:08.651
You remember that video
I showed you with the...

01:13:08.751 --> 01:13:12.387
They're chasing the bike
with the red... gas tank.

01:13:12.487 --> 01:13:16.423
The guy falls off and breaks
his neck and dies, that guy?

01:13:16.523 --> 01:13:18.024
- He died?
- The cops were chasing...

01:13:18.124 --> 01:13:19.925
- Yeah, he died.
- He died?

01:13:20.025 --> 01:13:22.576
The guy who fell off died, yeah.
Broke his neck.

01:13:22.676 --> 01:13:26.046
- I want that red.
- You want to die with a broken neck?

01:13:26.146 --> 01:13:28.681
No, I want the red...
I want the red... gas tank.

01:13:28.781 --> 01:13:31.641
You can have one piece of red
on your bike and the cops won't notice.

01:13:31.741 --> 01:13:34.636
You know what I'm talking... if you get
a whole red bike, the cops'll look at you.

01:13:34.736 --> 01:13:37.055
They'll find you, they'll see you easily.

01:13:37.155 --> 01:13:39.853
- They'll come after you.
- You're gonna die.

01:13:39.953 --> 01:13:45.828
You're gonna die because
of a red stripe on your motorcycle.

01:13:45.928 --> 01:13:50.421
You can decide on one thing and I want
the gas tank, I want yellow rims.

01:13:50.521 --> 01:13:54.635
- Yellow rims.
- Fuckin' bright... bright as the sun.

01:13:54.735 --> 01:13:58.255
You're the only girl
I ever met with a beard.

01:14:01.406 --> 01:14:05.375
- Yellow rims.
- Yeah. Yellow rims.

01:14:05.475 --> 01:14:08.829
- You gonna go around topless?
- Yeah.

01:14:29.397 --> 01:14:31.217
Hey.

01:14:32.299 --> 01:14:34.953
Hey! Hey.

01:15:04.428 --> 01:15:06.815
Marco!

01:15:08.998 --> 01:15:11.323
Marco!

01:15:13.834 --> 01:15:16.002
Marco!

01:15:16.502 --> 01:15:20.149
- Polo!
- Marco.

01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:20.394
Oh, I can't!

01:18:39.394 --> 01:18:42.114
Help, please.

01:20:39.074 --> 01:20:42.695
You got kids? You got any children?

01:20:44.645 --> 01:20:49.447
I got a... I got a son
here in this town. Yeah.

01:20:49.547 --> 01:20:55.033
I just... I rolled through today
and I hadn't seen him in like ten years.

01:20:55.133 --> 01:20:57.526
It's his birthday today.

01:20:57.918 --> 01:21:01.487
I took him out,
played some miniature golf.

01:21:01.587 --> 01:21:03.956
You're not gonna believe what happened.

01:21:04.056 --> 01:21:06.325
There we were, right,
we were just at the first hole

01:21:06.425 --> 01:21:09.560
of this mini-golf course
right outside of town,

01:21:09.660 --> 01:21:13.322
and we're having a good time. It's a little
awkward, I hadn't seen him in a while.

01:21:13.422 --> 01:21:16.530
He looks up at me,
he says the fuckin' weirdest thing.

01:21:16.630 --> 01:21:19.966
He says... "Hey, hey, Dad?

01:21:20.066 --> 01:21:23.568
What... what does a woman's
vagina look like?"

01:21:23.668 --> 01:21:27.070
Right? He says this to me.

01:21:27.170 --> 01:21:31.724
I didn't know what to fuckin' say, man,
I was like... "I don't know." I mean...

01:21:31.824 --> 01:21:33.869
I said, "Well...

01:21:33.969 --> 01:21:37.811
before sex a woman's vagina looks like...

01:21:37.911 --> 01:21:43.915
two rose petals with teardrops
of heaven glistening on it."

01:21:44.015 --> 01:21:47.469
We played a couple more holes, you know.

01:21:47.918 --> 01:21:51.187
Just trying to get to know
one another and he says...

01:21:51.287 --> 01:21:55.190
He brings it back up. He said...

01:21:55.590 --> 01:22:00.153
"Okay, what does a woman's
vagina look like after sex?"

01:22:01.862 --> 01:22:04.077
I was like...

01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:06.383
"After sex?

01:22:06.483 --> 01:22:09.541
It's like a... I don't know.

01:22:09.641 --> 01:22:14.045
You ever seen an extremely large bulldog
eating out of a vat of mayonnaise?"

01:22:18.607 --> 01:22:21.711
So... he liked that.

01:22:21.811 --> 01:22:24.096
He liked that.

01:22:25.746 --> 01:22:27.261
But...

01:22:27.361 --> 01:22:32.414
if I could just get real with you guys
for a second here, just... comedy aside.

01:22:32.514 --> 01:22:34.153
I'm not new to this area.

01:22:34.253 --> 01:22:38.757
I have a ten-year-old son here
and today was his birthday.

01:22:38.857 --> 01:22:43.227
I had the opportunity to take him out and
play some miniature golf with him today,

01:22:43.327 --> 01:22:46.729
which was a lot of fun for me
and he enjoyed it too.

01:22:46.829 --> 01:22:51.266
We were out at the...
Cactus Course outside of town?

01:22:51.866 --> 01:22:56.235
And... we were at the first hole, he...

01:22:56.335 --> 01:23:00.991
he looked up at me before he...
made his first shot and he asked...

01:23:01.873 --> 01:23:06.246
"Dad, what does a woman's
vagina look like?"

01:23:07.044 --> 01:23:10.365
And... I said, "Well..."

01:23:20.889 --> 01:23:23.101
Did you guys...

01:23:28.194 --> 01:23:32.549
Did you guys hear the one, the joke...

01:23:34.232 --> 01:23:36.584
about the...

01:23:41.669 --> 01:23:44.993
paparazzi with a heart of gold?

01:23:46.606 --> 01:23:48.877
The paparazzi

01:23:48.977 --> 01:23:51.779
with a heart of gold.

01:23:53.179 --> 01:23:55.781
He stole it from Princess Diana...

01:23:55.881 --> 01:23:58.964
as she lay dying in her car.

01:24:27.174 --> 01:24:28.976
Bam!

01:24:29.476 --> 01:24:31.128
Bam!

01:25:56.090 --> 01:25:58.610
We're not paying for that.

01:26:14.774 --> 01:26:18.328
One or two?

01:26:18.976 --> 01:26:21.563
- First one.
- Okay.

01:26:22.312 --> 01:26:26.000
One or two?

01:26:28.484 --> 01:26:30.270
Two.

01:26:34.221 --> 01:26:36.741
I'll be back in just a minute.

01:27:06.919 --> 01:27:08.739
Hello?

01:27:11.423 --> 01:27:13.243
Hello?

01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:17.846
Hello?

01:27:22.565 --> 01:27:24.585
Hello?

01:27:27.302 --> 01:27:29.522
Hello?

01:27:33.774 --> 01:27:35.794
Hello?

01:27:39.111 --> 01:27:41.431
Is anybody there?

01:27:45.016 --> 01:27:47.251
Hi, sweetheart.

01:27:47.351 --> 01:27:49.737
I'm in town.

01:27:53.021 --> 01:27:56.958
I'm real busy, but I'd love to see you.

01:27:57.058 --> 01:28:00.912
I'm... doing this show.

01:28:02.828 --> 01:28:06.950
I'm doing this show
in the Hollywood Hills and...

01:28:10.468 --> 01:28:15.357
it's a private residence. It's a...

01:28:17.273 --> 01:28:20.476
It's like a party, a celebrity party...

01:28:20.576 --> 01:28:24.932
and there'll be a lot of...
you know, singers and actors...

01:28:26.447 --> 01:28:29.849
important folks like that there, so...

01:28:31.259 --> 01:28:37.292
I think you'd have a lot of fun
if you wanted to come out and see me.

01:28:43.595 --> 01:28:45.615
I miss you.

01:29:15.992 --> 01:29:17.794
Sink!

01:29:18.494 --> 01:29:21.431
Sink! Sink! Sink!

01:29:21.531 --> 01:29:23.833
Sink! Sink!

01:29:23.933 --> 01:29:27.319
Come on, you fuckin' bitches, scream!

01:29:31.469 --> 01:29:34.154
Scream like you're getting fucked!

01:29:34.254 --> 01:29:36.539
Come on!

01:29:36.639 --> 01:29:38.475
Scream like you're getting fucked!

01:31:43.624 --> 01:31:46.411
- Come on!
- Hello?

01:32:15.752 --> 01:32:17.887
All right, hey.

01:32:17.987 --> 01:32:21.189
You okay? You all right?

01:32:22.489 --> 01:32:24.576
Thanks, guys.

01:32:30.497 --> 01:32:32.564
Can you help me?

01:32:32.664 --> 01:32:35.134
Hold on, just stand up.

01:32:35.432 --> 01:32:37.233
Just take a second.

01:32:38.468 --> 01:32:40.252
Jesus!
