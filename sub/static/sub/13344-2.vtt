WEBVTT

00:09.077 --> 00:10.978
AH, ALEX.

00:11.079 --> 00:12.746
PAUL.

00:26.394 --> 00:28.629
SO, ARE THERE
ANY RULES?

00:28.729 --> 00:32.166
- RULES?
- GROUND RULES.

00:32.266 --> 00:34.068
ANYTHING I SHOULD KNOW
BEFORE WE START?

00:34.168 --> 00:37.305
OH, NOT REALLY.
IT'S MORE OR LESS
UP TO YOU.

00:37.405 --> 00:41.475
OH, RIGHT, RIGHT.
I'M A CUSTOMER.

00:41.575 --> 00:42.910
YEAH.

00:43.010 --> 00:45.179
THOUGH IN MY
PROFESSION, WE SAY

00:45.279 --> 00:47.748
THAT THE CUSTOMER
IS ALWAYS WRONG.

00:49.383 --> 00:52.786
THAT'S A THERAPIST'S JOKE.

00:52.886 --> 00:56.190
( theme music playing )

01:26.254 --> 01:29.290
SO, DO YOU
RECOGNIZE ME?

01:29.390 --> 01:32.293
NO.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.363
I'M SORRY,
SHOULD I?

01:35.463 --> 01:37.998
WELL, I WAS TOLD
YOU'RE THE BEST--

01:38.098 --> 01:39.300
A MAN IN TUNE WITH
EVERYTHING AROUND HIM,

01:39.400 --> 01:41.435
SO, YES,
I GUESS YOU SHOULD.

01:41.535 --> 01:43.904
THANK YOU, BUT I DO THINK
THAT IN THIS PROFESSION,

01:44.004 --> 01:46.907
"THE BEST"
IS REALLY A MATTER

01:47.007 --> 01:48.676
OF PERSONAL OPINION.

01:48.776 --> 01:51.479
I DON'T KNOW, THE BEST
CAN BE ESTABLISHED BY FACTS

01:51.579 --> 01:53.281
AND FIGURES.

01:53.381 --> 01:56.617
YOU'RE THE BEST.
I DID MY RESEARCH--

01:56.717 --> 01:58.051
A COUPLE FORMER PATIENTS,

01:58.152 --> 02:01.255
SOMEONE ELSE WHO KNEW YOU
FROM GRADUATE SCHOOL.

02:01.355 --> 02:03.524
DOES THAT PRESSURE YOU?

02:03.624 --> 02:05.092
IS IT IMPORTANT
FOR YOU TO KNOW

02:05.193 --> 02:07.895
THAT I AM THE BEST?

02:07.995 --> 02:10.164
YES.
IT'S NOTHING
PERSONAL.

02:10.264 --> 02:12.500
I ALWAYS
GO TO THE BEST--
DENTISTS, MECHANICS.

02:12.600 --> 02:16.337
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY--
"SAVE NOW, PAY LATER."

02:16.437 --> 02:17.805
HMM.

02:17.905 --> 02:20.874
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK

02:20.974 --> 02:23.977
BEING "THE BEST"
THERAPIST ENTAILS?

02:24.077 --> 02:25.946
DO YOU RECOGNIZE ME?

02:26.046 --> 02:29.617
NO...
I DON'T.

02:29.717 --> 02:31.719
OKAY, LET ME HELP YOU.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.187
"THE MADRASA MURDERER"--

02:33.287 --> 02:35.088
DOES THAT MEAN
ANYTHING TO YOU?

02:35.189 --> 02:39.026
- NO.
- WASN'T THAT LONG AGO.

02:39.126 --> 02:41.094
A U.S. NAVY AIRCRAFT
HIT A TARGET

02:41.195 --> 02:42.396
ON THE OUTSKIRTS
OF BAGHDAD.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.765
NAVAL INTELLIGENCE
IDENTIFIED THE STRUCTURE

02:44.865 --> 02:46.567
AS AN INSURGENT SAFEHOUSE--

02:46.667 --> 02:48.101
A BUNKER.

02:48.202 --> 02:50.170
TURNS OUT
IT'S A MADRASA.

02:50.271 --> 02:52.473
LET ME TELL YOU
WHAT THAT IS.

02:52.573 --> 02:54.174
IT'S AN ISLAMIC
RELIGIOUS SCHOOL.

02:54.275 --> 02:57.010
BOYS, LIKE BEES IN A BEEHIVE,
STUDYING THE KORAN.

02:57.110 --> 03:00.314
16 OF THEM DEAD.

03:03.183 --> 03:06.053
- RINGS A BELL?
- YES, I REMEMBER THAT.

03:06.153 --> 03:08.055
SO, THAT'S ME.

03:08.155 --> 03:09.323
I FLEW THAT MISSION.

03:09.423 --> 03:12.693
( chuckles )
THE MADRASA MURDERER.

03:19.267 --> 03:21.935
SO DO YOU
SURF THE NET?

03:24.071 --> 03:26.340
WELL, SOMEHOW...

03:26.440 --> 03:28.242
WELL, IT WASN'T
REALLY SOMEHOW.

03:28.342 --> 03:30.611
LET'S CALL
A SPADE A SPADE.

03:30.711 --> 03:33.781
A LEAK,
PROBABLY ANOTHER
INTELLIGENCE FUCKUP.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.884
ANYWAY,
I WAS IDENTIFIED

03:36.984 --> 03:38.686
AS THE PILOT
IN THAT MISSION.

03:38.786 --> 03:41.121
AND MY PHOTO WAS PLACED
ON FUNDAMENTALIST WEBSITES.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.123
AND I'M NOT
TALKING AL-JAZEERA.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.592
I'M TALKING
WEBSITES THAT ARE...

03:44.692 --> 03:46.627
ASKING FOR MY HEAD
ON A PLATTER.

03:46.727 --> 03:49.363
OFFERING UP THE HEAVENS
AND 40 VIRGINS

03:49.463 --> 03:51.899
TO ANYONE WHO WILL SLIT
MY THROAT FROM EAR TO EAR.

03:51.999 --> 03:54.167
HERE.

03:54.268 --> 03:56.370
HERE I AM. NOW, IT'S
NOT A RECENT PHOTO.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.171
IT'S A PHOTO TAKEN
WHEN I WAS 18

03:58.272 --> 04:00.874
ON A HIGH SCHOOL
TRIP TO...

04:00.974 --> 04:04.645
EUROPE-- HOLLAND.
THAT CITY WITH
THE MINIATURES?

04:04.745 --> 04:06.179
ULTRE--
UTRECHT.

04:06.280 --> 04:09.717
- UTRECHT.
- GO AHEAD.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.654
SO WHILE I'M SITTING
HERE TALKING TO YOU,

04:13.754 --> 04:16.223
A MILLION FANATICS ARE
DOWNLOADING MY PORTRAIT

04:16.324 --> 04:18.392
AND PRINTING IT OUT
AS A DARTBOARD.

04:18.492 --> 04:21.395
( chuckles )
SILLY MOTHERFUCKERS.

04:23.664 --> 04:26.300
SO WHY HAVE YOU COME
TO SEE ME?

04:26.400 --> 04:29.337
WHOA-WHOA-WHOA.
WE'LL GET TO THAT.

04:29.437 --> 04:31.071
NOW, SO YOU'RE
PROBABLY THINKING,

04:31.171 --> 04:33.741
"WHAT'S IT LIKE?

04:33.841 --> 04:36.009
HE FLEW HIS MISSION,

04:36.109 --> 04:37.578
AND HE FLEW BACK,

04:37.678 --> 04:40.981
AND HE SAW THE BODIES
OF THOSE CHILDREN ON CNN."

04:42.816 --> 04:44.385
YOU'RE PROBABLY TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT,

04:44.485 --> 04:46.587
"WHAT WENT
THROUGH HIS HEAD?"

04:47.788 --> 04:48.922
LET ME TELL YOU.

04:49.022 --> 04:51.959
AFTER THAT KIND OF MISSION,
I DON'T WATCH CNN.

04:52.059 --> 04:54.562
I GO TO SLEEP.

04:55.195 --> 04:57.631
I'M DEAD TIRED.

04:58.932 --> 05:01.869
YOU'RE PROBABLY DYING TO ASK
HOW I CAN SLEEP NIGHTS.

05:01.969 --> 05:04.338
( chuckles )
OKAY.

05:04.438 --> 05:06.407
HOW DO YOU SLEEP?

05:06.507 --> 05:08.576
I SLEEP VERY WELL,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH,

05:08.676 --> 05:10.844
KNOWING IT WAS
"MISSION ACCOMPLISHED."

05:10.944 --> 05:12.413
AND WITH GREAT PRECISION,
LET ME TELL YOU.

05:12.513 --> 05:13.914
SEE, I FOLLOWED
MY ORDERS,

05:14.014 --> 05:16.350
WHICH WERE-- HIT MY TARGET
AND HIT IT ON TIME.

05:16.450 --> 05:17.751
TIME AND TARGET.

05:17.851 --> 05:19.753
DO YOU KNOW, WE HAVE
TO HIT OUR TARGETS

05:19.853 --> 05:22.423
WITHIN TWO SECONDS
OF THE ESTIMATED TIME?

05:22.523 --> 05:24.124
IT'S SURGICAL.

05:24.224 --> 05:26.293
THAT'S ONE SMALL WINDOW,

05:26.394 --> 05:28.228
AND I HAVE
NEVER MISSED IT.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.498
IF I HAD
FAILED THAT TASK,

05:30.598 --> 05:32.099
I'D BE IN TROUBLE
WITH MY SUPERIORS,

05:32.199 --> 05:33.801
WITH MY CONSCIENCE,

05:33.901 --> 05:36.336
AND WITH THE SYSTEM.

05:36.437 --> 05:38.872
BUT I HIT MY TARGET.

05:39.707 --> 05:42.543
SO I SLEEP LIKE A BABY.

05:45.178 --> 05:49.049
HOW MANY CHILDREN

05:49.149 --> 05:52.319
DIED IN THIS MISSION?

05:52.420 --> 05:55.088
THE MEDIA
PUTS IT AT 16.

05:55.188 --> 05:59.560
- AND THE AIR FORCE?
- THE NAVY, DOCTOR. LISTEN.

05:59.660 --> 06:01.562
THE NAVY SAYS NOTHING
AND WHY SHOULD IT?

06:01.662 --> 06:02.996
WE'RE NOT IN THE BUSINESS
OF BODY COUNTS,

06:03.096 --> 06:04.732
WE'RE IN THE BUSINESS
OF HITTING OUR TARGETS.

06:04.832 --> 06:06.534
WE DON'T LOOK BACK OVER
OUR SHOULDER, BELIEVE ME.

06:06.634 --> 06:08.235
WE'RE OUT THERE
DOING OUR THING

06:08.335 --> 06:09.537
SO YOU CAN SIT
HERE IN PEACE

06:09.637 --> 06:11.572
TALKING TO PEOPLE
FOR A LIVING.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.579
SO WHEN
DID YOU HEAR

06:18.679 --> 06:21.048
THE CHILDREN
HAD BEEN KILLED?

06:22.249 --> 06:24.017
THE FOLLOWING AFTERNOON.

06:24.117 --> 06:25.285
I HEARD IT
ON THE INTERNET.

06:25.385 --> 06:28.388
AND WHAT EXACTLY
DID YOU HEAR?

06:28.489 --> 06:32.125
ANYTHING SPECIFICALLY
THAT YOU REMEMBER?

06:33.126 --> 06:34.995
LIKE WHAT?
LISTEN,

06:35.095 --> 06:37.064
IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S
TIME IN THE DAY TO BE
SURFING THE NET.

06:37.164 --> 06:38.566
THIS WAS A MOMENT.
I GOT AWAY.

06:38.666 --> 06:41.034
THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF
TO KEEP ME BUSY.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.537
WHAT KIND OF STUFF?

06:43.637 --> 06:47.107
MISSION REVIEW,
AERIAL PHOTOS, VIDEO--

06:47.207 --> 06:48.809
JUST DATA, STUFF.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.644
PREPARATION
VERSUS EXECUTION.

06:50.744 --> 06:53.380
EVERY TINY TECHNICAL ASPECT
OF OUR FLIGHT

06:53.481 --> 06:55.949
IS RECORDED AND ANALYZED
BY THE MAN.

06:56.049 --> 06:57.417
THERE'S NOWHERE
TO HIDE.

06:57.518 --> 06:58.719
AND THAT'S THE WAY
IT SHOULD BE.

06:58.819 --> 07:00.754
IT'S JUST STUFF
AND MORE STUFF.

07:00.854 --> 07:02.990
IT'S LIKE WHEN
MY MOTHER DIED.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.358
MY FATHER HAD A YEAR'S WORTH
OF STUFF TO DEAL WITH--

07:05.459 --> 07:08.328
LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT,
HER OFFICE, GARDEN,

07:08.428 --> 07:11.298
A LIFETIME
OF PHOTO ALBUMS.

07:11.398 --> 07:12.633
AND EVERY TIME
I'D TALK TO HIM,

07:12.733 --> 07:16.336
I'D ASK HOW HE WAS,
EXPECTING, UH,

07:16.436 --> 07:20.073
YOU KNOW,
THAT HE'D BREAK DOWN...

07:21.041 --> 07:22.843
FINALLY.

07:25.012 --> 07:27.548
"IT NEVER ENDS, ALEX.
IT NEVER ENDS.

07:27.648 --> 07:29.517
YOUR MOTHER LEFT
SUCH A MESS.

07:29.617 --> 07:32.820
SHE DIDN'T KNOW
SHE WAS GONNA DIE."

07:38.291 --> 07:41.194
AND THAT'S ALL HE'D SAY.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.430
AND AFTER LESS THAN A YEAR,
HE MET ANOTHER WOMAN

07:43.531 --> 07:45.398
AND GOT MARRIED
JUST LIKE THAT.

07:45.499 --> 07:47.501
SO, HOW DID THAT
MAKE YOU FEEL?

07:48.902 --> 07:50.003
I WAS SURPRISED.

07:50.103 --> 07:53.073
A WHOLE LIFE TOGETHER
AND NOT A SINGLE TEAR?

07:53.173 --> 07:54.775
MMM.

07:54.875 --> 07:57.511
IT'S INTERESTING
THAT YOU COMPARE

07:57.611 --> 08:00.047
THE DEATH OF YOUR MOTHER
WITH THIS MISSION

08:00.147 --> 08:02.249
THAT YOU'VE JUST FLOWN.

08:02.349 --> 08:05.418
THAT'S VERY
CLEVER OF YOU.

08:05.519 --> 08:07.755
BUT THERE'S
NO RELATION WHATSOEVER.

08:07.855 --> 08:10.190
MY MOTHER'S DEATH WAS
THE MOST TRAUMATIC EVENT

08:10.290 --> 08:11.992
IN MY LIFE SO FAR.

08:12.092 --> 08:14.562
THAT MISSION WAS JUST
ANOTHER MISSION FOR ALEX.

08:14.662 --> 08:16.263
THERE IS NO COMPARISON.

08:16.363 --> 08:18.465
ANYWAY, LOOK,
THAT'S OVER.

08:18.566 --> 08:21.501
AND I'M BACK NOW.
I'M BACK AT MY HOME BASE

08:21.602 --> 08:23.604
AND NOW I'M ON R&R.

08:23.704 --> 08:26.339
WHAT KIND OF THINGS
DO YOU DO FOR R&R?

08:26.439 --> 08:28.876
DON'T TRY TO GET
AHEAD OF ME.

08:28.976 --> 08:30.343
I'M A RUNNER.

08:30.443 --> 08:31.812
I WAS A HELL OF A RUNNER
IN HIGH SCHOOL

08:31.912 --> 08:33.981
AND I'M STILL A PRETTY
GOOD ONE FOR AN OLD MAN.

08:34.081 --> 08:35.282
SO I RUN

08:35.382 --> 08:37.117
WITH MY FAIRY FRIEND,

08:37.217 --> 08:38.919
THIS GAY GUY WHO COULD
KICK YOUR ASS AT ANY SPORT.

08:39.019 --> 08:42.122
AND DOES HE HAVE A NAME,
THIS FRIEND?

08:43.156 --> 08:44.658
- DANIEL.
- DANIEL.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.560
WE'VE BEEN
RUNNING TOGETHER
FOR A LONG TIME,

08:46.660 --> 08:48.862
BETWEEN SIX
AND 10 MILES--

08:48.962 --> 08:51.832
DEPENDING ON WHETHER
ONE OF US IS ON HIS PERIOD.

08:51.932 --> 08:53.667
ONLY THIS TIME
I CHALLENGED HIM A LITTLE.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.669
SEE, THERE'S NO REAL GOOD
RUNNING IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

08:55.769 --> 08:57.805
NOT FOR THE U.S. MILITARY,

08:57.905 --> 08:59.640
UNLESS YOU WANT A ROADSIDE BOMB
TO BLOW YOUR BALLS OFF.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.374
SO I WANTED TO DO
SOME SERIOUS RUNNING.

09:01.474 --> 09:04.411
I SAID,
"LET'S GO FOR 15."

09:04.511 --> 09:06.446
THEN AFTER 15 MILES,
I SAID, "20."

09:06.546 --> 09:08.048
NOW HE DIDN'T WANT IT,

09:08.148 --> 09:10.117
BUT I SAID, "OKAY,
I'LL GO ON MY OWN."

09:10.217 --> 09:11.919
SO HE FOLLOWED.

09:12.019 --> 09:13.854
I SAID, "YOU KNOW,
ONLY SIX MORE

09:13.954 --> 09:17.290
AND IT'S A MARATHON.
LET'S DO IT."

09:17.390 --> 09:21.161
HE WANTED TO STOP.
LITTLE BITCH.

09:22.529 --> 09:25.265
BUT I WASN'T
GONNA STOP.

09:26.433 --> 09:29.402
IT WAS TOUGH.

09:29.502 --> 09:33.040
WE WERE OUT OF WATER--
WE'RE ON FUMES.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.277
AT 22 MILES,

09:37.377 --> 09:39.947
I HAD A HEART ATTACK
AND DIED.

09:40.781 --> 09:42.616
A TEXTBOOK CASE--

09:42.716 --> 09:44.952
STRAIGHT OUTTA
MED SCHOOL--

09:45.052 --> 09:46.920
ENLARGEMENT OF
THE LEFT VENTRICLE.

09:47.020 --> 09:51.024
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FAMILY
HISTORY ON BOTH SIDES,
FATAL.

09:51.124 --> 09:53.260
ACCORDING TO THE EKG
AND ACCORDING TO STATISTICS,

09:53.360 --> 09:56.664
I HAD A 97.3% CHANCE
OF DYING,

09:56.764 --> 09:59.132
OR 2.7% CHANCE
OF LIVING.

09:59.232 --> 10:02.102
ANYWAY, DEAD.

10:02.202 --> 10:05.773
YOU ACTUALLY DIED?

10:05.873 --> 10:08.475
IN THE CLINICAL SENSE.
NO PULSE, NO BRAIN ACTIVITY.

10:08.575 --> 10:10.744
TOTAL CLINICAL DEATH.

10:12.145 --> 10:13.413
BUT HERE I AM.

10:13.513 --> 10:16.283
- ( sighs )
- AND NOW I'M GONNA

10:16.383 --> 10:18.351
DISAPPOINT YOU, DOCTOR.

10:22.089 --> 10:24.491
DON'T YOU WANNA KNOW WHY
I'M GONNA DISAPPOINT YOU?

10:24.591 --> 10:26.126
LET ME HELP YOU OUT.
THE LIGHT, THE TUNNEL,

10:26.226 --> 10:28.195
THE WHOLE LIFE-
FLASHING-BEFORE-MY-EYES,

10:28.295 --> 10:30.630
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
INTERESTED IN, RIGHT?

10:30.731 --> 10:33.266
NO, I WASN'T--

10:33.366 --> 10:35.002
I WASN'T ACTUALLY THINKING
OF THAT AT ALL.

10:35.102 --> 10:36.704
BUT I AM INTERESTED.
PLEASE, TELL ME.

10:36.804 --> 10:39.106
HEY, I COULDN'T GIVE
A SHIT ABOUT IT EITHER.

10:39.206 --> 10:41.341
BUT THAT'S ALL EVERYONE
WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT--

10:41.441 --> 10:44.712
MY FATHER, MY WIFE--
EVERYONE.

10:44.812 --> 10:46.780
THEY JUST WANTED TO HEAR
ABOUT THE GODDAMN TUNNEL.

10:48.481 --> 10:51.218
JUST-- SUCH BULLSHIT.

10:56.089 --> 10:57.825
DO YOU FEEL
THAT MAYBE YOU...

10:57.925 --> 11:00.928
DISAPPOINTED PEOPLE BY NOT
HAVING THAT EXPERIENCE?

11:01.028 --> 11:04.497
THAT MAYBE
IN SOME WAY,

11:04.597 --> 11:06.333
YOU FAILED
TO DELIVER THE GOODS?

11:08.969 --> 11:11.604
NOBODY REALLY KNOWS WHAT
WAS GOING THROUGH MY MIND

11:11.705 --> 11:13.540
DURING THOSE
LAST FEW MOMENTS.

11:13.640 --> 11:17.677
SOON AS THERE WAS
NO MORE TUNNEL, NO ONE
WAS INTERESTED.

11:17.778 --> 11:19.579
AND WHAT WAS GOING
THROUGH YOUR MIND?

11:19.679 --> 11:22.415
OH, I KNEW WHAT WAS
HAPPENING. YOU CAN TELL.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.684
AND YOU'RE AFRAID
IT'S THE END.

11:25.886 --> 11:29.256
IN ALL THAT TIME
UNTIL I LOST CONSCIOUSNESS,

11:30.891 --> 11:34.027
ALL THAT TIME--
I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT WAS,

11:34.127 --> 11:36.063
MAYBE SECONDS,
MAYBE HALF A MINUTE--

11:36.163 --> 11:38.899
ALL THAT TIME,
I KEPT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
IF I HAD A HARD-ON.

11:38.999 --> 11:41.735
SEE, I DON'T KNOW HOW
I REMEMBER THIS--

11:41.835 --> 11:43.036
SOMETHING MY
GRANDMOTHER TOLD ME

11:43.136 --> 11:45.172
WHEN I WAS
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

11:45.272 --> 11:47.274
AND SHE SAID,
"WHEN GRANDPA DIED,

11:47.374 --> 11:51.244
SHE FOUND HIM LYING
NAKED IN THE BATHTUB

11:51.344 --> 11:53.013
WITH A HUGE ERECTION.

11:53.113 --> 11:56.049
NOW HE WAS
92 YEARS OLD.

11:56.149 --> 11:59.887
SHE HADN'T SEEN AN ERECTION
LIKE THAT IN 20 YEARS.

11:59.987 --> 12:01.855
( chuckles )
SHE LIKED IT.

12:01.955 --> 12:05.425
SHE SAID THAT WAS "GOD'S
FINAL GIFT TO A MAN--

12:05.525 --> 12:06.927
A DEAD MAN'S BONER."

12:07.027 --> 12:09.329
THEY CALL IT
"ANGEL LUST."

12:09.429 --> 12:12.099
ANYWAY, SO I'M LYING
THERE AND I'M THINKING
ABOUT THAT STORY.

12:12.199 --> 12:14.868
I KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME
AND I SAID TO MYSELF,

12:14.968 --> 12:18.538
"GOD ALMIGHTY, JUST DON'T LET ME
HAVE AN ERECTION RIGHT NOW,

12:18.638 --> 12:20.240
NOT A HARD-ON."

12:20.340 --> 12:23.576
BECAUSE IF YOU HAD AN
ERECTION, IT WOULD MEAN...

12:23.676 --> 12:26.413
THAT WOULD MEAN
THAT I WAS DEAD.

12:26.513 --> 12:27.915
OH.

12:28.015 --> 12:30.884
AND YOUR FRIEND DANIEL WAS
WITH YOU THROUGHOUT THIS?

12:30.984 --> 12:33.086
YEAH, RESUSCITATION, CPR--

12:33.186 --> 12:35.422
DANIEL'S A DOCTOR,
I FORGOT TO SAY THAT.

12:35.522 --> 12:36.990
FOR A MINUTE THERE,
I THOUGHT

12:37.090 --> 12:38.859
YOU WERE GOING TO SAY
SOMETHING ELSE, THAT PERHAPS

12:38.959 --> 12:41.829
YOUR FEAR OF AN ERECTION
WAS ASSOCIATED

12:41.929 --> 12:44.431
WITH THE PRESENCE
OF YOUR FRIEND, DANIEL.

12:44.531 --> 12:48.001
( laughs )
EXCUSE ME?

12:48.101 --> 12:49.970
DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE
EXAGGERATING A LITTLE?

12:50.070 --> 12:53.173
LOOK, I EXPLAINED
SOMETHING SIMPLE--
A DEAD MAN'S ERECTION.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.042
WHAT'S THAT GOTTA DO
WITH DANIEL?

12:55.142 --> 12:58.711
WELL, MAYBE I DIDN'T MAKE
MYSELF CLEAR EARLIER ON

12:58.812 --> 13:02.149
WHEN I WAS TALKING
ABOUT THE CUSTOMER
ALWAYS BEING WRONG.

13:02.249 --> 13:06.286
WHAT I MEANT WAS
THAT SOMETIMES

13:06.386 --> 13:08.388
THE PATIENT HIDES THINGS
FROM HIS THERAPIST--

13:08.488 --> 13:10.858
FROM HIMSELF.

13:10.958 --> 13:12.792
AND SO PART
OF OUR JOB IS TO

13:12.893 --> 13:16.196
UNCOVER THE THINGS
THAT WE HIDE.

13:16.296 --> 13:19.166
( laughs )

13:19.266 --> 13:22.369
SO MY SECRET IS I'M
AFRAID OF HOMOSEXUALS?

13:22.469 --> 13:24.604
NO, NOT NECESSARILY.

13:24.704 --> 13:29.309
BUT I JUST WANTED
TO CLARIFY THAT.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.278
YEAH, OKAY.
THAT'S NEITHER HERE NOR THERE.
I WANNA GET TO MY POINT.

13:31.378 --> 13:34.614
- GO AHEAD.
- I DIDN'T HAVE THE ERECTION
SO YOU CAN RELAX.

13:34.714 --> 13:37.617
BUT I TELL YOU
I REMEMBER VERY VIVIDLY

13:37.717 --> 13:39.086
THAT MOMENT JUST
BEFORE PASSING OUT--

13:39.186 --> 13:41.889
BEFORE LOSING
CONSCIOUSNESS.

13:45.025 --> 13:48.028
"LOSING CONSCIOUSNESS"--
THAT'S A FUNNY EXPRESSION.

13:48.128 --> 13:50.330
WHY DO YOU THINK
THAT'S A FUNNY EXPRESSION?

13:50.430 --> 13:52.099
"LOSING" CONSCIOUSNESS--

13:52.199 --> 13:53.800
IT'S AN EXPRESSION
MY FATHER WOULD USE--

13:53.901 --> 13:55.802
EVERYTHING IN TERMS

13:55.903 --> 13:58.338
OF PROFITS AND LOSS.

13:59.039 --> 14:02.675
FITS HIM LIKE A GLOVE.

14:02.775 --> 14:06.113
SO SOMETHING ABOUT
HOW YOU DESCRIBE
YOUR LAST MOMENTS

14:06.213 --> 14:08.481
IS EQUATED WITH YOUR
FATHER'S SEEING THINGS

14:08.581 --> 14:09.950
IN TERMS OF
PROFIT AND LOSS?

14:10.050 --> 14:12.352
- IS THAT--
- OKAY, WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,

14:12.452 --> 14:14.888
I THINK WE'VE COME
TO THIS WAY TOO EARLY.

14:14.988 --> 14:16.756
ALL THIS STUFF ABOUT
THE FATHER-SON RELATIONSHIP,

14:16.856 --> 14:18.058
I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD
COME UP SO SOON.

14:18.158 --> 14:19.893
YOU THINK
IT'S TOO SOON?

14:19.993 --> 14:21.461
NO, FORGET
WHAT I FEEL.

14:21.561 --> 14:24.331
I KNOW IT'S TOO SOON.
I WANNA KNOW WHAT YOU THINK.

14:24.431 --> 14:26.699
SO YOU'RE TESTING ME?

14:26.799 --> 14:28.835
I THINK I'M ENTITLED
TO SOME TESTING.
I'M PAYING FOR IT.

14:28.936 --> 14:30.971
ACTUALLY, ALEX, I THINK
YOU'VE BEEN TESTING ME

14:31.071 --> 14:32.439
SINCE YOU WALKED
THROUGH THE DOOR.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.841
YOU'VE ASKED ABOUT ME
AND MY REPUTATION.

14:34.942 --> 14:37.577
YOU ASK-- WELL YOU
PRACTICALLY DEMAND

14:37.677 --> 14:39.079
THAT I ASK YOU
CERTAIN QUESTIONS

14:39.179 --> 14:41.148
THAT YOU THINK
I'M DYING TO ASK.

14:41.248 --> 14:42.916
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT
TO YOU, I THINK,

14:43.016 --> 14:45.618
THAT I ADHERE TO CERTAIN
STANDARDS THAT YOU SET

14:45.718 --> 14:47.054
BEFORE YOU WALKED
THROUGH THE DOOR.

14:47.154 --> 14:48.755
AND WHAT'S WRONG
WITH THAT?

14:48.855 --> 14:51.391
LOOK, I DID
MY RESEARCH.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.726
IT'S A ONE-AND-A-HALF-HOUR
DRIVE TO GET HERE

14:53.826 --> 14:55.495
AND I'M PAYING YOU
GOOD MONEY.

14:55.595 --> 14:58.331
AND I'M EXPECTED TO TELL YOU,
A PERFECT STRANGER,

14:58.431 --> 15:00.900
THE MOST INTIMATE THINGS
ABOUT MY LIFE.

15:01.001 --> 15:03.503
PLUS, THERE ARE RISKS HERE.

15:03.603 --> 15:05.638
IT'S NOT LIKE THE NAVY'S
GONNA GIVE ME A MEDAL

15:05.738 --> 15:07.174
FOR SPILLING
MY GUTS IN HERE.

15:07.274 --> 15:08.841
I'M NOT GONNA OPEN UP
TO YOU JUST LIKE THAT

15:08.942 --> 15:10.343
WITHOUT KNOWING
WHAT YOU ARE.

15:10.443 --> 15:13.513
AND WHAT DO YOU
EXPECT TO FIND, ALEX?

15:13.613 --> 15:15.915
HOW ARE WE GOING
TO KNOW

15:16.016 --> 15:18.618
THAT I'M A GOOD ENOUGH
THERAPIST FOR YOU?

15:18.718 --> 15:21.121
I'LL KNOW...

15:21.221 --> 15:23.090
ACCORDING
TO YOUR OPINION.

15:23.190 --> 15:24.691
MY OPINION OF WHAT?

15:24.791 --> 15:27.060
OF THE ISSUE I CAME HERE
TO TALK ABOUT.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.296
BUT I'LL COME TO THAT
IN A MINUTE.

15:29.396 --> 15:31.764
IT HAS TO DO WITH
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME

15:31.864 --> 15:33.033
AFTER TAKING ME
OUT OF THE FREEZER.

15:33.133 --> 15:35.335
THE FREEZER?

15:35.435 --> 15:38.505
OH, YOU MEAN
THAT YOU WERE GROUNDED?

15:38.605 --> 15:40.540
NO, LITERALLY FROZEN.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.009
THEY FROZE ME.

15:42.109 --> 15:44.111
THE MOBILE INTENSIVE
CARE UNIT ARRIVED

15:44.211 --> 15:46.179
AND THEY PUT ME IN A SUIT
THAT FREEZES YOU.

15:46.279 --> 15:47.714
THEY'VE GOT ONE
OUT OF PRESBYTERIAN,

15:47.814 --> 15:50.517
WHICH IS NO MORE THAN 3/4
OF A MILE FROM WHERE I COLLAPSED

15:50.617 --> 15:52.519
AND THEIR E.R. IS TOPS.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.554
LET'S GO BACK TO THIS--

15:54.654 --> 15:58.125
YEAH, WE'RE
GETTING THERE.
YOU HAVE NO PATIENCE.

16:00.093 --> 16:02.662
I WAS TOLD YOU WERE
A GOOD LISTENER.

16:04.097 --> 16:06.299
NOW LOOK...

16:06.399 --> 16:08.468
IT WORKS ON A VERY
SIMPLE PRINCIPLE.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.270
IT REDUCES THE SHOCK
TO THE BODY'S SYSTEMS

16:10.370 --> 16:11.904
BY DROPPING
THE BODY TEMPERATURE.

16:12.005 --> 16:14.807
OH. SO HOW LONG
WERE YOU--

16:14.907 --> 16:17.444
IN MY CASE, 48 HOURS.
IT'S A RECORD.

16:17.544 --> 16:19.946
THERE'S NO HISTORY
OF ANYONE WHO'S BEEN
IN THAT SUIT

16:20.047 --> 16:22.115
FOR SUCH A LONG
PERIOD OF TIME.

16:22.215 --> 16:24.217
I GUESS I WENT A LONG WAY
UP THAT TUNNEL, HUH?

16:24.317 --> 16:27.120
THE TUNNEL
THAT WASN'T THERE.

16:28.121 --> 16:30.290
NO, UNFORTUNATELY NOT.

16:32.192 --> 16:34.661
SO TELL ME
WHAT YOU REMEMBER

16:34.761 --> 16:37.097
ABOUT THIS 48 HOURS.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.766
MOSTLY I REMEMBER...

16:39.866 --> 16:42.135
A TERRIBLE FATIGUE.

16:42.235 --> 16:44.504
I GUESS THAT'S WHY
THEY CALL IT "DEAD TIRED."

16:44.604 --> 16:46.906
IT'S PHYSICAL
BUT MAINLY MENTAL--

16:47.006 --> 16:49.942
EXHAUSTION.

16:50.043 --> 16:52.445
AND I REMEMBER
VERY CLEARLY

16:52.545 --> 16:54.381
THE RELIEF I FELT

16:54.481 --> 16:57.217
WHEN I SUCCEEDED
IN COMING BACK OVER
INTO THE WORLD.

16:57.317 --> 16:59.286
YOU SAY
THAT YOU "SUCCEEDED"

16:59.386 --> 17:01.888
IN COMING BACK
TO THIS WORLD.

17:01.988 --> 17:04.757
DID YOU FEEL IT WAS
UNDER YOUR CONTROL?

17:04.857 --> 17:06.259
WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO GET AT?

17:06.359 --> 17:08.628
I'M NOT TRYING
TO GET AT ANYTHING.

17:08.728 --> 17:10.630
BUT WHAT
YOU'RE DESCRIBING

17:10.730 --> 17:12.832
IS A STRONG WILL
TO LIVE.

17:12.932 --> 17:14.401
I MEAN,
DURING THIS EXPERIENCE,

17:14.501 --> 17:16.269
THERE WAS A DECISION
TO GO ON LIVING.

17:16.369 --> 17:19.172
YEAH, I GUESS
YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:19.272 --> 17:22.475
YET, DESPITE HAVING MADE
THIS EFFORT TO LIVE...

17:23.776 --> 17:25.578
EVERYBODY'S
DISAPPOINTED.

17:25.678 --> 17:27.447
LISTEN, IT'S NOT EVERY DAY
PEOPLE MEET SOMEONE

17:27.547 --> 17:29.249
WHO'S COME BACK
FROM THE DEAD.

17:29.349 --> 17:30.617
IT'S A ONE-
IN-A-MILLION THING.

17:30.717 --> 17:33.686
AND IF YOU DON'T
SUPPLY THE GOODS, THEN...

17:34.754 --> 17:36.423
LISTEN, I HAVE NEVER

17:36.523 --> 17:39.592
SPENT A DAY IN MY LIFE
IN A HOSPITAL.

17:39.692 --> 17:42.262
YOU GET IT?
NEVER.

17:42.362 --> 17:44.030
PERHAPS YOUR ANGER
ISN'T DIRECTED

17:44.131 --> 17:45.998
AT THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE
INTERESTED IN THE TUNNEL.

17:46.099 --> 17:48.268
BUT YOU'RE ANGRY
AT YOURSELF, ALEX--

17:48.368 --> 17:50.137
HOW YOUR BODY
BETRAYED YOU.

17:50.237 --> 17:51.838
I MEAN, THIS IS
A SYSTEMS FAILURE

17:51.938 --> 17:54.674
THAT WAS NOT
SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN
TO SOMEBODY LIKE YOU.

17:54.774 --> 17:56.143
HMM.

17:56.243 --> 17:58.778
LISTEN, I HAVE A BROTHER
WHO'S NOT TOO BRIGHT.

17:58.878 --> 18:00.213
HE'S A REAL ESTATE AGENT.
WHATEVER.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.081
ANYWAY, HE'S
A GREAT ATHLETE.

18:02.182 --> 18:04.117
AND HE ONCE
PROVED TO ME--

18:04.217 --> 18:06.052
AND HE DOES HIS
RESEARCH, BELIEVE ME--

18:06.153 --> 18:09.156
THAT ALL THE GREAT
QUARTERBACKS

18:09.256 --> 18:10.857
IN THE HISTORY OF FOOTBALL

18:10.957 --> 18:12.992
WERE ALSO THE BEST-LOOKING.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.428
NAMATH, STAUBACH,
CUNNINGHAM--

18:15.528 --> 18:17.029
THEY'RE ALL REALLY
GOOD-LOOKING PEOPLE.

18:17.130 --> 18:19.199
SEE, THE BEST-LOOKING
STUDENTS IN THE CLASS

18:19.299 --> 18:20.567
ARE OFTEN
GREAT ATHLETES.

18:20.667 --> 18:23.436
- YOU KNOW WHY THAT IS?
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

18:23.536 --> 18:25.505
IT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO
WITH SPORTS, REALLY.

18:25.605 --> 18:29.509
WHEN THEY GOT THEIR GIFT
FROM GOD THE FATHER,

18:29.609 --> 18:31.211
OR WHOEVER THE HELL
DOLES OUT THE TALENT,

18:31.311 --> 18:32.912
THEY GOT
THE WHOLE PACKAGE--

18:33.012 --> 18:36.082
BEAUTY, TALENT,
CHARACTER.

18:36.183 --> 18:40.052
THAT'S HOW IT IS.
IT'S AN EVOLUTIONARY THING.

18:40.153 --> 18:42.589
SO, HOW'S YOUR FOOTBALL?

18:42.689 --> 18:44.557
FOOTBALL'S NOT MY GAME.

18:44.657 --> 18:46.393
RUNNING, OF COURSE,

18:46.493 --> 18:48.561
WRESTLING, POLE VAULT
ONCE UPON A TIME.

18:48.661 --> 18:52.131
BUT NOW I AM PART
OF A MILITARY ELITE.

18:52.232 --> 18:53.900
ATHLETES MAY BE POPULAR

18:54.000 --> 18:55.602
BUT WE ARE
THE CREME DE LA CREME.

18:55.702 --> 18:57.404
SEE, WHAT YOU HAVE
TO UNDERSTAND IS YOU'RE
TALKING TO A PERSON HERE

18:57.504 --> 18:59.839
WHOSE WHOLE LIFE
WAS PERFECT.

18:59.939 --> 19:04.444
PEOPLE IN MY LINE OF WORK
ARE BORN TO EXCEL,
TO BE PERFECT.

19:06.179 --> 19:07.547
IT WASN'T OUR CHOICE.

19:07.647 --> 19:10.383
IT WAS LIFE THAT CHOSE US
TO BE THE BEST.

19:10.483 --> 19:14.120
AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN,
"LIFE CHOSE US?"

19:14.221 --> 19:16.256
YEAH, YOU DON'T BECOME
A FIGHTER PILOT

19:16.356 --> 19:17.757
SUDDENLY AT AGE 20.

19:17.857 --> 19:21.127
AT AGE SEVEN OR EIGHT WHEN
YOU'RE IN THE THIRD GRADE,

19:21.228 --> 19:23.230
YOU KNOW YOU'RE TALENTED.

19:23.330 --> 19:25.432
YOU KNOW YOU'RE HEADED
SOMEWHERE SPECIAL.

19:25.532 --> 19:27.133
YOU ARE GOING
TO BE THE BEST.

19:27.234 --> 19:29.502
AND IT ALL LAYS OUT
RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU--

19:29.602 --> 19:33.039
TOP GRADES, VARSITY LETTERS,
YOU NAME IT.

19:33.139 --> 19:35.375
I'M A TOPGUN GRAD,
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

19:35.475 --> 19:37.410
THAT TRAINING
IS NOT FOR PUSSIES.

19:37.510 --> 19:40.447
SO, IF YOU DON'T ACHIEVE
YOUR PERSONAL BEST...

19:41.481 --> 19:42.849
ARE YOU DISAPPOINTED
IN YOURSELF?

19:42.949 --> 19:45.618
NO, NO, THAT'S NOT...

19:46.653 --> 19:49.389
( sighs )

19:54.060 --> 19:56.963
- HOW MUCH LONGER DO WE HAVE?
- WE'VE GOT TIME.

19:57.063 --> 20:00.099
I'LL TELL YOU
WHEN IT'S TIME.

20:00.199 --> 20:03.370
OKAY, SO HERE'S
MY POINT-- FINALLY.

20:03.470 --> 20:05.171
I CAME HERE TO GET
YOUR ADVICE ON SOMETHING.

20:05.272 --> 20:07.307
SURE.

20:08.508 --> 20:11.444
I DECIDED TO GO THERE--
TO THE TARGET.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.813
YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT HERE?

20:15.348 --> 20:18.184
YOU MEAN TO THE SITE
WHERE YOU DROPPED THE BOMB?

20:18.285 --> 20:20.953
- TO THE SCHOOL?
- MADRASA.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.489
I WANNA GO BACK THERE.
I WANNA TAKE A LOOK AROUND.

20:22.589 --> 20:24.223
TO THE PLACE WHERE
THE CHILDREN WERE KILLED?

20:24.324 --> 20:26.293
CORRECT. AND, LISTEN,
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING,

20:26.393 --> 20:27.960
SO LET ME STRAIGHTEN
THIS OUT FOR YOU.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.162
I DON'T HAVE
A GUILTY CONSCIENCE.
I ALREADY TOLD YOU THAT.

20:30.263 --> 20:32.399
I SLEEP WELL AT NIGHT.
VERY WELL.

20:32.499 --> 20:34.100
WHY WOULD YOU
WANT TO GO BACK?

20:34.200 --> 20:35.535
I'M INTERESTED.

20:35.635 --> 20:38.037
FROM THE MOMENT I CAME
OUT OF THAT FREEZER,

20:38.137 --> 20:40.573
I KNEW I WANTED
TO GO BACK.

20:40.673 --> 20:42.342
AND IT CAME UP
IN A CONVERSATION
I HAD WITH DANIEL

20:42.442 --> 20:43.876
WHEN HE CAME TO VISIT ME
AT THE HOSPITAL.

20:43.976 --> 20:45.978
AND HE THINKS,

20:46.078 --> 20:48.247
WHO KNOWS--
I'M GONNA FREAK OUT
OR SOMETHING.

20:48.348 --> 20:50.350
HE THINKS IT'S
A CRAZY THING TO DO.

20:50.450 --> 20:52.319
AND HE SAID I NEED
TO SEE SOMEONE FIRST--

20:52.419 --> 20:55.488
PSYCHOLOGIST,
PSYCHIATRIST.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.724
DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S DANGEROUS?

20:57.824 --> 20:59.292
NOT AT ALL.

20:59.392 --> 21:01.227
I DON'T REALLY THINK
ANYONE WILL RECOGNIZE ME.

21:01.328 --> 21:02.629
BUT YOUR PICTURE'S
ON THE INTERNET.

21:02.729 --> 21:04.964
NO WAY.
YOU SAW THE PICTURE.

21:05.064 --> 21:06.666
IT'S TOTALLY RIDICULOUS.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.468
MY MOTHER WOULDN'T RECOGNIZE
ME FROM THAT PICTURE.

21:08.568 --> 21:11.771
- NOT EVEN MICHAELA.
- WHO'S MICHAELA?

21:11.871 --> 21:13.506
MY WIFE.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.207
AND WHAT DOES SHE
THINK OF ALL THIS?

21:15.308 --> 21:17.477
WHAT'S SHE GOT
TO DO WITH IT?

21:17.577 --> 21:19.479
DON'T YOU TALK THINGS
OVER WITH YOUR WIFE?

21:19.579 --> 21:20.880
LISTEN, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS NOT FOR ME.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.849
ALL THIS "WHAT DO YOU FEEL,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?"

21:22.949 --> 21:25.284
I ASKED YOU SOMETHING.
I CAME TO YOU TO CONSULT

21:25.385 --> 21:27.019
ABOUT SOMETHING
VERY CLEAR AND SPECIFIC.

21:27.119 --> 21:29.789
SO YOU WANT ME TO TELL YOU
THAT THIS DESIRE OF YOURS

21:29.889 --> 21:32.525
TO GO BACK TO WHERE
THE BOMBING TOOK PLACE

21:32.625 --> 21:36.162
- IS A GOOD THING?
- OKAY, YEAH, YES.

21:36.262 --> 21:39.532
DO YOU WANT ME TO
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THIS VISIT?

21:39.632 --> 21:42.301
OKAY, DO ME A FAVOR,
DON'T MAKE ME INTO AN IDIOT.

21:42.402 --> 21:44.737
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO TELL ME? I'M NOT
TAKING RESPONSIBILITY?

21:44.837 --> 21:46.806
NO, I'M JUST GOING BACK
TO SOMETHING THAT YOU SAID

21:46.906 --> 21:48.375
EARLIER ON.

21:48.475 --> 21:51.978
REMEMBER YOU SAID
THAT LIFE CHOSE YOU

21:52.078 --> 21:53.646
TO BE A MEMBER
OF AN ELITE?

21:53.746 --> 21:55.415
THAT IT WASN'T
YOUR DECISION?

21:55.515 --> 21:58.184
MAYBE THAT'S AN ATTITUDE
YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH.

21:58.284 --> 21:59.619
YOU'RE COMFORTABLE
WITH IT BECAUSE

21:59.719 --> 22:02.389
YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE
ANY DECISIONS.

22:02.489 --> 22:04.657
IT RELIEVES YOU
OF RESPONSIBILITY.

22:04.757 --> 22:07.427
YOUR COMMANDING OFFICER,
HE MAKES THE DECISIONS,

22:07.527 --> 22:11.297
CONVEYS THEM TO YOU,
AND YOU EXECUTE THEM.

22:11.398 --> 22:13.733
WAIT, ARE YOU TRYING
TO TELL ME

22:13.833 --> 22:16.936
THAT I'M ASKING YOU TO BE
MY COMMANDING OFFICER?

22:17.036 --> 22:19.271
OKAY, I'LL BUY IT.

22:19.372 --> 22:21.340
SO, ARE YOU
WILLING TO, UH,

22:21.441 --> 22:25.111
TO BE MY C.O.
FOR $150 AN HOUR?

22:25.211 --> 22:27.447
WELL, I DON'T
THINK I'M...

22:27.547 --> 22:30.483
I DON'T THINK I'M
QUALIFIED FOR THAT.

22:30.583 --> 22:33.953
BUT WOULD YOU AGREE TO BE
YOUR OWN COMMANDING OFFICER?

22:34.053 --> 22:37.657
OH, LISTEN, YOU KNOW WHAT,
JUST LEAVE IT ALONE.

22:37.757 --> 22:39.959
I CAN SEE I'M NOT GONNA GET
ANYTHING USEFUL OUT OF YOU.

22:40.059 --> 22:43.095
- AND YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO BE THE BEST?
- BUT I'M NOT THE BEST, ALEX.

22:43.195 --> 22:44.897
MAYBE YOU'RE THE BEST,

22:44.997 --> 22:46.766
BUT I'M NOT.

22:46.866 --> 22:49.636
THINK ABOUT
THE RAMIFICATIONS

22:49.736 --> 22:51.738
OF WHAT YOU'RE
ABOUT TO DO.

22:51.838 --> 22:54.240
YOU'RE GOING BACK
TO A PLACE WHERE YOU
DROPPED A BOMB.

22:54.340 --> 22:56.242
16 CHILDREN
WERE KILLED.

22:56.342 --> 22:57.677
YOUR FACE IS
ON THE INTERNET

22:57.777 --> 23:00.713
AND THERE'S A PRICE
ON YOUR HEAD.

23:00.813 --> 23:03.883
SO, WAIT, WAIT.
NOW YOU'RE SAYING THAT
YOU AGREE WITH DANIEL,

23:03.983 --> 23:05.618
THAT I'VE GONE
CRAZY OR SOMETHING?

23:05.718 --> 23:07.587
WELL, HOW WOULD YOU FEEL
IF I DID AGREE WITH DANIEL?

23:07.687 --> 23:10.457
HOW HARD IS
A STRAIGHT ANSWER?
I'VE GOT A PLANE TO CATCH.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.460
WHY? WHERE
ARE YOU GOING?

23:13.560 --> 23:16.563
ARE YOU NOT
LISTENING TO ME?
I AM GOING BACK THERE--

23:16.663 --> 23:19.131
NONSTOP,
DC TO FRANKFURT,

23:19.231 --> 23:20.700
THEN FRANKFURT-AMMAN,

23:20.800 --> 23:23.102
THURSDAY MORNING,
BY CHARTER, TO BAGHDAD.

23:23.202 --> 23:25.438
YOU'RE LEAVING TONIGHT?

23:25.538 --> 23:28.541
GOOD MORNING, DOCTOR.

23:28.641 --> 23:30.376
I'M GOING BACK AS PART
OF A CHURCH GROUP,

23:30.477 --> 23:31.811
A CHARITY.

23:31.911 --> 23:34.481
I'M GONNA BE VISITING
THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS.

23:34.581 --> 23:37.149
NO, NO, THIS IS NOT
PART OF NAVY PROTOCOL.

23:37.249 --> 23:38.818
LET ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING.

23:38.918 --> 23:41.253
WHEN YOU WERE
RUNNING WITH DANIEL--
WAS IT 22 MILES?

23:41.353 --> 23:42.689
MMM.

23:42.789 --> 23:44.457
HOW LONG
DID THAT TAKE?

23:44.557 --> 23:47.026
I DON'T KNOW,
ALMOST THREE HOURS.

23:47.126 --> 23:50.563
DANIEL WANTED TO QUIT.
HE'S ALWAYS GOING ON ABOUT

23:50.663 --> 23:52.599
YOUR OPTIMUM PULSE
DURING EXERCISE

23:52.699 --> 23:54.366
AND HE THOUGHT WE SHOULDN'T
GO OVER 85% PERCENT.

23:54.467 --> 23:56.435
YOU KNOW WHAT
I FIND INTERESTING?

23:56.536 --> 23:58.905
THAT SHORTLY AFTER
YOU COMPLETE THIS MISSION,

23:59.005 --> 24:01.508
YOU GO ON LEAVE,

24:01.608 --> 24:03.710
AND AGAINST THE ADVICE
OF YOUR BEST FRIEND,

24:03.810 --> 24:06.045
WHO ALSO HAPPENS
TO BE A MEDICAL DOCTOR,

24:06.145 --> 24:07.680
YOU WORK YOURSELF UP

24:07.780 --> 24:10.149
INTO A STATE
OF EXTREME EXERTION.

24:10.249 --> 24:12.451
IT'S AS IF YOU WERE

24:12.552 --> 24:14.587
AVOIDING GOING BACK
TO ACTIVE DUTY.

24:14.687 --> 24:16.422
NO, I HAVE NO PROBLEM
FLYING AGAIN.

24:16.523 --> 24:18.691
IN FACT, I'M DYING
TO GET BACK INTO ACTION.

24:18.791 --> 24:21.460
UH-HUH. DO YOU NOT
SEE A CONNECTION

24:21.561 --> 24:25.264
BETWEEN YOUR COLLAPSE
AND WHAT WENT BEFORE?

24:25.364 --> 24:26.966
NO, I KNOW YOU SAY

24:27.066 --> 24:30.703
YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY GUILT FEELINGS,

24:30.803 --> 24:34.073
BUT DON'T YOU THINK THERE'S
A STRONG DESIRE THERE

24:34.173 --> 24:38.144
TO ATONE
FOR YOUR ACTIONS?

24:39.245 --> 24:40.847
( huffs )

24:49.088 --> 24:51.758
DO THEY HAVE ANY
COFFEE AROUND HERE?

24:52.925 --> 24:55.027
I COULD USE
A GOOD CUP OF COFFEE.

24:56.428 --> 24:58.931
UM, OUR TIME IS UP,
I'M AFRAID.

25:01.167 --> 25:03.335
COME ON, I STILL
GOT A COUPLE THINGS
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT.

25:03.435 --> 25:05.705
OH, I'M HAPPY
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

25:09.175 --> 25:11.510
( sighs )

25:16.783 --> 25:18.450
YOU KNOW, I THINK
IT'S IMPORTANT

25:18.551 --> 25:20.486
THAT YOU
KEEP TALKING
ABOUT ALL THIS.

25:20.587 --> 25:22.922
OKAY, I'LL KEEP
THAT IN MIND.

25:25.357 --> 25:26.726
I BETTER PAY YOU NOW.

25:26.826 --> 25:28.895
WHO KNOWS HOW THIS
LITTLE TRIP WILL TURN OUT?

25:28.995 --> 25:30.830
YOU'RE SERIOUS
ABOUT TRAVELING TODAY?

25:36.135 --> 25:38.237
OH, IT'S THIS WAY.

25:39.572 --> 25:41.207
I'LL WRITE YOU
AN INVOICE FOR THE--

25:41.307 --> 25:43.275
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

25:46.545 --> 25:47.947
AREN'T YOU GONNA
WISH ME LUCK?

25:48.047 --> 25:50.216
YES.

25:50.316 --> 25:52.652
GOOD LUCK, ALEX.

26:03.796 --> 26:05.865
( music plays )
