00:32.920 --> 00:34.000
-Hello.
-Hi.

00:35.920 --> 00:37.440
I'd like some flowers, please.

00:38.760 --> 00:40.120
What did you have in mind?

00:40.200 --> 00:42.200
Any particular colors?

00:42.280 --> 00:45.520
No, just a… mix, I suppose.

00:45.600 --> 00:47.360
-Some different colors?
-Exactly.

00:48.160 --> 00:51.680
I've just prepared this bouquet
with some different colors.

00:51.760 --> 00:55.440
-Some different shades of pink.
-That looks good.

00:55.520 --> 00:57.400
-Perfect.
-Oh, okay.

01:19.560 --> 01:22.560
-What do you do for a living?
-I'm a drama teacher.

01:22.640 --> 01:25.040
-A drama teacher?
-Yes. How about you?

01:25.800 --> 01:26.840
I work here.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.320
Yes, of course you do.

01:37.040 --> 01:39.520
I'm running out of vases.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.200
I can imagine.

01:49.040 --> 01:53.760
I was thinking it's getting expensive
for you with all these flowers.

01:53.840 --> 01:59.200
It might be cheaper for you
to take me out on a date.

02:05.200 --> 02:08.600
It's Ro. She's missing. She's gone.

02:08.680 --> 02:12.400
-She didn't come home last night either.
-Oh.

02:12.480 --> 02:14.320
Will you help me?

02:14.920 --> 02:16.760
Okay. Have a seat.

02:20.240 --> 02:21.200
Okay.

02:25.640 --> 02:28.320
I wish we hadn't gone
to that damn viewing.

02:28.400 --> 02:30.000
Ro didn't even want to go.

02:36.080 --> 02:38.320
What are you doing? Will you hurry up?

02:38.400 --> 02:41.840
Can't we just take it a bit easy?

02:42.360 --> 02:46.280
-I can't take it easy.
-Don't fret. We're here now.

02:46.360 --> 02:49.640
This might be our last chance.

02:53.760 --> 02:55.960
OPEN HOUSE

03:03.520 --> 03:04.560
Is it broken?

03:06.360 --> 03:07.720
Come, let's take the stairs.

03:08.240 --> 03:11.520
-We're going all the way up, right?
-No, second floor.

03:11.600 --> 03:15.240
We can't live here with a broken elevator
with kids and stuff.

03:15.320 --> 03:19.520
-They'll fix it.
-I have a really bad gut feeling.

03:19.600 --> 03:22.960
But that happens every time
we go for a viewing.

03:23.040 --> 03:25.440
No, that's not true. Julia.

03:27.360 --> 03:30.160
-Didn't Ro want to go to the viewing?
-No.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.480
Did she say why? It sounds a bit odd.

03:34.560 --> 03:35.640
No.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.720
What's going on? What's the problem?

03:38.800 --> 03:40.080
Ro is missing.

03:40.600 --> 03:42.720
That's not good.
When did you last see her?

03:42.800 --> 03:45.960
Two days ago. I've called
and messaged her, but she won't reply.

03:46.040 --> 03:48.160
Will you just hang on?

03:48.240 --> 03:49.640
I need to speak to Julia.

03:53.280 --> 03:54.240
One moment.

03:57.200 --> 03:59.440
Do you think a pregnant woman
is the perpetrator?

03:59.520 --> 04:03.120
No, but I think she might know who it is.

04:03.200 --> 04:05.320
Something is not right about Ro.

04:05.400 --> 04:07.920
She might know something.
That's why she's hiding.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.560
So you're putting pressure on Julia?
Just stop it.

04:11.640 --> 04:13.320
Our priority is to find Ro.

04:13.400 --> 04:15.800
Whether she has information
about the robbery or not.

04:50.160 --> 04:51.400
I think he's gone.

04:53.480 --> 04:57.680
What the hell? Get down.
Lie down! Come back!

04:58.360 --> 05:01.600
This is insane.
There's a madman with a gun there.

05:02.160 --> 05:03.280
Idiots.

05:06.440 --> 05:07.480
Get down!

05:09.800 --> 05:11.320
He went out into the stairwell.

05:11.400 --> 05:14.840
-He's watching from outside instead.
-Get down.

05:18.280 --> 05:20.400
I need something to eat anyway.

05:20.480 --> 05:23.720
-Get down. Are you crazy?
-How can you think of food now?

05:23.800 --> 05:28.320
I'm hungry. You ought to eat too.
Think about the baby.

05:28.400 --> 05:30.440
-Get down.
-Isn't that what I'm doing?

05:31.480 --> 05:33.360
I'm gonna check the fridge.

05:33.440 --> 05:35.120
You can't eat food from the fridge.

05:35.200 --> 05:38.120
-Why not?
-The fridge is probably empty.

05:38.200 --> 05:40.360
Can't you behave like a normal person?

05:40.440 --> 05:41.640
What have I done?

05:41.720 --> 05:43.640
You know what I mean.

05:48.840 --> 05:50.800
There must be some food in the kitchen.

06:02.160 --> 06:04.240
-Hello.
-Hi.

06:07.760 --> 06:10.000
-How is it going?
-I don't know.

06:16.200 --> 06:18.320
Ro doesn't want this baby.

06:19.960 --> 06:23.040
-Did she say so?
-Every apartment we look at is not right.

06:23.120 --> 06:25.880
It's too big, too small,
too expensive, or too high up.

06:25.960 --> 06:30.000
I don't know. I don't understand
why she doesn't want to live with us.

06:36.600 --> 06:38.080
Is your back hurting?

06:38.160 --> 06:41.200
A bit maybe.

06:42.840 --> 06:43.720
There.

06:44.840 --> 06:45.920
Here.

06:47.560 --> 06:50.360
I'll head out
and see if anyone has seen Ro.

06:51.400 --> 06:52.440
We will find her.

06:57.160 --> 07:01.800
Julia, did you get the impression
during the viewing that Ro

07:01.880 --> 07:06.680
behaved strangely in some way
or tried to keep something from you?

07:06.760 --> 07:08.760
What? What do you know?

07:11.120 --> 07:11.960
About what?

07:17.120 --> 07:20.880
Julia, if you know something,
you have to tell me.

07:20.960 --> 07:23.320
It's incredibly important.
You understand, right?

07:23.400 --> 07:24.600
Okay.

07:28.280 --> 07:29.560
I think Ro…

07:34.800 --> 07:35.640
Yes?

07:36.760 --> 07:38.560
…is cheating on me.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.080
Cheating on you?

07:41.160 --> 07:42.360
Yes.

07:42.440 --> 07:46.320
Oh. Yeah. Oh, that's tough.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.120
Cheating is no fun.

07:48.960 --> 07:52.080
But do you have any idea
where she might be?

07:53.920 --> 07:56.000
-Have you seen this woman?
-No.

07:57.840 --> 07:59.120
Are you sure?

07:59.200 --> 08:00.680
Have you seen this woman?

08:01.520 --> 08:02.760
No? Okay. Thank you.

08:02.840 --> 08:04.240
No, sorry.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.520
-No, I haven't seen her.
-Okay, thank you.

08:15.240 --> 08:16.280
Roger!

08:17.560 --> 08:18.680
Your mobile.

08:20.800 --> 08:21.920
Roger!

08:23.600 --> 08:24.640
I don't know who it is.

08:27.760 --> 08:30.800
-Roger Bergvall speaking.
<i>-Hi, it's me.</i>

08:31.600 --> 08:33.240
<i>-Ro.</i>
-Hi.

08:33.320 --> 08:36.480
<i>Things are going up shit creek.</i>
<i>I need to talk to you.</i>

08:36.560 --> 08:39.440
I'll be right there.

08:40.280 --> 08:41.320
I'm on my way.

08:42.320 --> 08:43.840
Roger, who was it?

08:44.560 --> 08:45.600
Roger?

08:46.760 --> 08:48.080
Where are you going?

08:53.080 --> 08:54.000
Roger!

08:59.920 --> 09:02.640
I'd like to talk about the other hostages.

09:02.720 --> 09:06.200
What was your impression of them?

09:06.280 --> 09:08.480
What was your impression of those people?

09:08.560 --> 09:12.400
Anna-Lena was very nice to talk to.

09:13.440 --> 09:17.000
I liked her. Estelle was a bit demented.

09:17.080 --> 09:22.160
She was a bit difficult to… but nice.
There was nothing strange about her.

09:22.240 --> 09:27.360
Zarah was a bit hard to get close to,
but she was very nice.

09:27.920 --> 09:31.200
Lennart, the bunny man…

09:31.280 --> 09:34.640
-Yeah.
-I didn't really speak to him.

09:35.280 --> 09:36.400
I have no opinion of him.

09:38.520 --> 09:40.160
And the others?

09:40.960 --> 09:41.920
Which ones?

09:43.280 --> 09:45.040
Well, there was…

09:47.000 --> 09:48.640
-There was--
-Oh, Roger.

09:49.560 --> 09:51.960
I forgot Roger. He was an idiot.

09:52.520 --> 09:54.560
He took up a lot of space. Just stupid.

09:54.640 --> 09:57.440
-Okay.
-I don't get why Anna-Lena is with him.

09:57.520 --> 09:59.760
And there was one more, yeah?

10:01.520 --> 10:03.880
No, those are all I remember.

10:21.360 --> 10:22.200
Oh.

10:23.440 --> 10:25.120
Did you wet yourself?

10:25.880 --> 10:27.560
-I haven't wet myself.
-Okay.

10:27.640 --> 10:30.600
Cecilia isn't here, is she?

10:30.680 --> 10:34.160
Was it the baby… The placenta… Your water?

10:34.240 --> 10:37.480
-My water has broken.
-Okay, don't worry.

10:37.560 --> 10:40.760
-No.
-Make sure you don't slip in it.

11:09.080 --> 11:10.120
-Hi.
-Hi.

11:23.080 --> 11:24.640
I'm not ready to be a mom.

11:28.000 --> 11:28.880
Right.

11:35.880 --> 11:37.200
Was that why you left?

11:38.600 --> 11:39.480
Yes.

11:55.040 --> 11:58.040
Aren't you going to lie on the floor
with your wife?

11:58.120 --> 12:00.400
No. Is there any food?

12:01.720 --> 12:03.400
-Limes.
-Just limes?

12:08.920 --> 12:10.960
What idiot lives here?

12:11.040 --> 12:14.360
The place is packed with stuff,

12:14.440 --> 12:16.560
but the fridge is empty.

12:19.600 --> 12:20.640
What's that?

12:21.680 --> 12:22.520
Food.

12:36.200 --> 12:37.160
Was it good?

12:37.240 --> 12:38.200
No.

12:41.960 --> 12:43.800
I was with someone else when I met Ro.

12:45.480 --> 12:46.440
Were you?

12:47.200 --> 12:50.800
She was an adventurous type,
always seeking new experiences.

12:50.880 --> 12:53.880
It was bungee jumping and mountaineering.

12:53.960 --> 12:55.240
Everything.

12:55.320 --> 12:58.160
In the end, I felt,

12:58.240 --> 13:00.000
"Am I not exciting enough?"

13:00.560 --> 13:03.080
"Can't we just sit and be bored together?"

13:04.760 --> 13:06.560
Roger is the same.

13:07.320 --> 13:08.560
-What?
-No.

13:09.880 --> 13:11.880
-I don't mean bungee jumping.
-No.

13:12.440 --> 13:13.280
But he…

13:14.760 --> 13:16.520
always needs to have a project.

13:16.600 --> 13:20.880
We can't just go to the movies.

13:20.960 --> 13:21.920
What kind of project?

13:22.000 --> 13:25.560
We're forever traipsing to Ikea
to buy an extension lead or something.

13:26.160 --> 13:27.120
How exciting.

13:32.320 --> 13:35.680
I thought it might be easier
to live with someone…

13:36.720 --> 13:37.760
Of the same sex?

13:38.880 --> 13:39.720
Yes.

13:40.480 --> 13:43.200
You don't fall for a particular sex.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.920
No, you fall for an idiot.

13:46.160 --> 13:48.200
Why is Ro such an idiot, then?

13:51.080 --> 13:53.280
I don't know. Everything was so good.

13:54.360 --> 13:56.400
I've been feeling quite anxious.

13:57.040 --> 13:58.760
She makes me feel safe.

14:00.120 --> 14:02.480
Until I got pregnant.
Now she's just totally…

14:03.720 --> 14:04.880
off, distant.

14:07.600 --> 14:10.520
I'll have to be a single mom.

14:10.600 --> 14:11.880
It'll be okay.

14:14.440 --> 14:17.440
How long is it until your…

14:18.320 --> 14:19.200
My wife?

14:19.800 --> 14:21.080
Until she gives birth?

14:21.160 --> 14:22.400
Any day now.

14:26.640 --> 14:27.480
Shit.

14:33.800 --> 14:36.000
I don't think I want this apartment.

14:37.400 --> 14:39.040
Struggling to make up your mind?

14:40.240 --> 14:42.240
No, I'm not normally like this,

14:42.320 --> 14:45.240
but I don't want
to make such a big decision

14:45.320 --> 14:46.960
without Dad checking it first.

14:47.680 --> 14:50.040
When would he come?

14:50.120 --> 14:51.400
He won't.

14:52.720 --> 14:53.680
No?

14:54.360 --> 14:55.360
He's got dementia.

15:00.120 --> 15:00.960
I see.

15:01.040 --> 15:03.800
Half of the time,
he doesn't know who I am.

15:03.880 --> 15:07.160
The rest of the time,
I think he pretends to recognize me

15:07.240 --> 15:08.560
to not upset me.

15:09.520 --> 15:13.600
But he was the world's best dad.

15:17.920 --> 15:18.920
Sure.

15:26.760 --> 15:29.600
There's nothing wrong with this apartment.

15:30.360 --> 15:32.280
You said there was mold everywhere.

15:32.360 --> 15:33.200
There's no mold.

15:33.280 --> 15:36.560
It's just superficial stuff,
but it's easy to fix.

15:36.640 --> 15:39.360
I can't fix superficial stuff,
so never mind.

15:39.440 --> 15:41.400
I can show you how to do it. It's easy.

15:43.080 --> 15:46.000
You're going to show me
how to do superficial repairs?

15:47.720 --> 15:48.840
Sure.

15:49.480 --> 15:50.320
Okay.

15:53.240 --> 15:55.960
I'll show you.
I'm damn good at these things.

15:56.440 --> 15:57.600
I want to see it first.

15:58.120 --> 15:59.680
Yes, I'll show you.

16:04.560 --> 16:07.000
Excuse me, have you seen this woman?

16:07.080 --> 16:08.880
-No, sorry.
-Okay. Thank you.

16:14.280 --> 16:16.800
-Yes?
-Hi. Did you find Ro?

16:16.880 --> 16:19.560
No, I'm still looking. How is Julia?

16:19.640 --> 16:21.080
The baby is coming.

16:21.160 --> 16:22.880
She's giving birth, damn it.

16:22.960 --> 16:25.600
-How far apart are the contractions?
-How far apart--

16:25.680 --> 16:26.720
Get off!

16:26.800 --> 16:30.360
-How far apart are the contractions?
-I don't know. It hurts like hell.

16:30.440 --> 16:32.320
<i>-Listen to her.</i>
-She needs to go to hospital.

16:32.400 --> 16:35.640
What do I do?
Do I call an ambulance or what do I do?

16:35.720 --> 16:39.040
Take her to the car
and drive her to the hospital,

16:39.120 --> 16:40.320
<i>and I'll see you there.</i>

16:40.400 --> 16:45.040
-We need to get going.
-I'm just going to get my coat.

16:45.120 --> 16:47.120
Forget your damn coat!

16:50.040 --> 16:51.880
-Hi.
-Hello.

16:52.480 --> 16:54.680
-Have you seen this woman?
-No. Lou?

16:54.760 --> 16:56.520
Milou, have you seen her?

16:58.160 --> 17:00.440
Is that the murderer?

17:01.320 --> 17:02.160
The murderer?

17:02.240 --> 17:05.200
The robber. You know what I mean.

17:05.280 --> 17:06.800
No, we just need to find her.

17:08.520 --> 17:09.400
What did she do?

17:09.480 --> 17:12.720
Her wife is about to give birth.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.800
Right. Check the pizza place.

17:18.960 --> 17:21.480
So how do you become a good parent?

17:22.760 --> 17:25.200
Kids aren't as fragile as you might think.

17:26.320 --> 17:28.240
-No?
-No, they're not.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
I know 'cause I looked after mine
when they were little.

17:32.480 --> 17:34.440
-Really?
-Yeah.

17:35.200 --> 17:36.160
I know.

17:37.360 --> 17:38.520
I'm a dinosaur.

17:38.600 --> 17:41.480
I was more thinking that
it must have been less common then.

17:41.560 --> 17:45.880
Yes, it wasn't that common
for men to stay home, but I did.

17:46.640 --> 17:49.960
Anna-Lena thinks
it was a sacrifice, but it wasn't.

17:51.040 --> 17:52.720
I loved every second.

17:53.920 --> 17:56.800
Do you not have grandkids?

17:59.840 --> 18:04.880
Some think that the world is overpopulated
and others want to focus on their careers,

18:04.960 --> 18:06.200
so, no, I haven't got any.

18:08.280 --> 18:12.640
Is that why you're doing
these property deals?

18:15.640 --> 18:17.280
I'm trying to be nice to you,

18:17.360 --> 18:20.960
and you're accusing me
of having a void in my life.

18:21.040 --> 18:23.200
I have no void in my life.

18:24.320 --> 18:26.880
Things are just the way I like them.

18:26.960 --> 18:29.200
Sorry, I didn't mean it like that.

18:31.400 --> 18:35.320
What the hell am I saying?
Fucking nonsense.

18:35.400 --> 18:39.680
It's all over.
With Anna-Lena, the apartments…

18:41.280 --> 18:45.480
I mean, who the hell rents
a medieval fuck bunny

18:45.560 --> 18:47.600
behind their husband's back?
Who does that?

18:47.680 --> 18:49.920
-It's fucking sick.
-Totally.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.160
But she must really love you.

18:52.240 --> 18:54.080
Just think, she did that for you.

18:54.720 --> 18:57.280
No, she doesn't trust me.
That's what it is.

18:57.360 --> 19:00.640
She doesn't think
I can negotiate the price of the property,

19:00.720 --> 19:02.000
without hiring a perv.

19:02.800 --> 19:05.520
You think she does that
because she doesn't trust you?

19:05.600 --> 19:07.680
-Is that what it's about?
-Yes.

19:07.760 --> 19:11.920
But do you do these property deals
for her sake or yours?

19:12.000 --> 19:16.080
It's for our sake.
It's important for both of us.

19:16.160 --> 19:19.720
It's our project that we work on together.
It's her baby too.

19:20.440 --> 19:22.160
Do you actually believe that?

19:29.000 --> 19:29.840
Ro!

19:32.600 --> 19:35.160
This day just keeps getting better.

19:36.120 --> 19:36.960
Ro,

19:38.040 --> 19:39.600
you need to come with me.

19:39.680 --> 19:42.360
You can't just
come in here without reason--

19:42.440 --> 19:45.400
-What are you on about?
-She's got a right to a lawyer.

19:45.480 --> 19:47.240
She's going to be a mom. Now.

19:47.320 --> 19:50.760
-What the hell are you saying?
-Her water has broken.

19:50.840 --> 19:54.040
Hey, we can do this.
I'll come with you. Let's go.

19:54.120 --> 19:55.920
Quickly, the check, please.

19:57.680 --> 20:00.640
That's great breathing, Julia.
You're doing great.

20:00.720 --> 20:01.840
How's it going?

20:01.920 --> 20:03.080
It's underway in there.

20:03.160 --> 20:06.240
I thought she'd give birth in the car.
I panicked.

20:10.320 --> 20:11.840
Ro, look at me.

20:13.520 --> 20:15.320
What is it you wouldn't manage?

20:19.000 --> 20:21.880
You think that it's impossible
to become a good parent

20:21.960 --> 20:25.480
after all your dad has done. I understand.

20:26.800 --> 20:30.520
I have a great checklist for new parents.
Do you wanna hear it?

20:33.240 --> 20:35.320
Will you love the kid?

20:35.400 --> 20:36.320
Yes.

20:36.400 --> 20:37.680
Good. Check.

20:39.120 --> 20:40.960
That's the most important box to tick.

20:42.280 --> 20:43.200
Okay.

20:44.080 --> 20:46.320
Will you try to offer the kid security?

20:47.480 --> 20:48.880
I don't know if I can.

20:48.960 --> 20:50.520
Of course you can.

20:50.600 --> 20:53.400
If the kid's unwell, you just pick them up

20:53.480 --> 20:57.280
and give them a cuddle.
You can do that, right?

20:57.840 --> 20:59.320
-Yeah.
-Check. Great.

20:59.400 --> 21:00.920
That just leaves the last box.

21:01.520 --> 21:04.320
Will you read stories and sing songs,

21:04.400 --> 21:08.200
and say, "Everything, my child,
will be better tomorrow"?

21:09.960 --> 21:11.720
-Yes.
-Check. There you are.

21:11.800 --> 21:14.000
Now you've ticked all the darn boxes.

21:14.080 --> 21:17.240
Congratulations. You're a jackpot mom.

21:17.320 --> 21:19.680
You'll be a top-notch mom.

21:19.760 --> 21:22.640
-It'll all be fine.
-Julia might not think so.

21:22.720 --> 21:25.920
It was the only thing she talked about
on the way here.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.240
"Where's Ro?
The baby mustn't come without Ro."

21:28.320 --> 21:30.280
She talks about you all the time.

21:31.200 --> 21:32.200
I told you so.

21:34.320 --> 21:35.320
You can do this.

21:35.880 --> 21:38.680
You go in. It's gonna be just fine.

21:39.920 --> 21:40.840
Good.

21:41.800 --> 21:42.800
Great.

21:44.880 --> 21:46.080
Be strong.

21:47.160 --> 21:50.320
-You're doing really well, Julia.
-Okay.

21:52.080 --> 21:53.960
We're preparing for the epidural.

21:54.040 --> 21:56.120
I'll call the anesthetist.

21:56.920 --> 22:00.560
-Are you Ro? Come in.
-Hi.

22:03.560 --> 22:04.560
Hello.

22:05.040 --> 22:06.640
-Hi.
-Hi.

22:07.520 --> 22:08.960
Sorry, Julia.

22:13.560 --> 22:14.400
Julia.

22:15.120 --> 22:17.320
I love you lots.

22:17.920 --> 22:18.840
Lots and lots.

22:19.360 --> 22:24.400
You'll be a great mom,
and I'm gonna do my best.

22:25.760 --> 22:29.320
I will look after the kid as best I can.

22:30.600 --> 22:34.400
I'll sing nursery rhymes, read stories.

22:34.480 --> 22:37.800
I'll… We can do this.

22:38.480 --> 22:40.600
-I'm gonna really be there.
-Ro!

22:40.680 --> 22:41.640
Yes?

22:44.280 --> 22:45.720
I love you so much.

22:46.440 --> 22:50.320
But if you don't shut up now,
I'm gonna need to hit you.

22:50.400 --> 22:53.360
-Sorry, I can leave if you like.
-No, hold my hand.

22:59.600 --> 23:01.040
Are you staying?

23:01.120 --> 23:02.680
Definitely.

23:03.520 --> 23:04.800
-Bye.
-See you.

23:06.280 --> 23:10.960
God, I was shaking. I panicked.

23:11.040 --> 23:15.480
Yes, it's not an easy experience.

23:41.960 --> 23:42.800
Roger?

23:46.360 --> 23:47.840
Where have you been?

23:47.920 --> 23:49.960
At the hospital with Ro and Julia.

23:50.520 --> 23:52.240
The baby's been born. It's a boy.

23:55.440 --> 23:57.160
We should send flowers.

23:58.320 --> 24:00.080
I was gonna ask you something.

24:01.680 --> 24:03.840
God help us if you lie to me now.

24:11.800 --> 24:13.880
Do you like renovating apartments?

24:13.960 --> 24:16.880
Of course I do. It's what we do tog--

24:16.960 --> 24:19.680
Stop lying, for fuck's sake.
Is this what we've become?

24:19.760 --> 24:22.000
Two people lying to each other?

24:25.560 --> 24:26.520
No.

24:26.600 --> 24:28.880
I don't like renovating apartments.

24:31.520 --> 24:32.480
Okay.

24:34.920 --> 24:39.040
If you got to choose,
would you like to go to Ikea?

24:40.000 --> 24:40.840
No.

24:42.960 --> 24:43.960
Ow.

24:44.680 --> 24:48.400
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Going to Ikea makes you so happy.

24:48.480 --> 24:51.400
-I love making you happy.
-What makes you happy, then?

24:54.440 --> 24:56.560
I don't know, but it doesn't matter.

24:56.640 --> 24:59.520
Shit, how selfish can you get?

24:59.600 --> 25:01.960
Can I not make you happy for once?

25:06.040 --> 25:09.280
The movies, maybe,
but it's not important, Roger.

25:09.360 --> 25:12.440
Check the listings to see
if there's anything you wanna see.

25:12.520 --> 25:14.280
-Now?
-Sure.

25:15.200 --> 25:18.040
We can make the nine o'clock showing.
If you want.

25:22.400 --> 25:23.720
-Do you?
-Yes.

25:29.560 --> 25:31.360
-Mind my nose.
-Sorry.

25:33.680 --> 25:36.320
We can even see
a romantic drama if you like.

25:36.400 --> 25:37.280
No.

25:37.360 --> 25:39.720
Yes, let's watch a romantic drama.

25:48.720 --> 25:49.680
Dad.

25:51.760 --> 25:52.800
I've got it.

25:53.800 --> 25:57.080
No one mentions the real estate agent
in any interviews.

25:57.160 --> 25:58.640
Oredsson? What do you mean?

25:58.720 --> 26:01.600
No one ever mentions her
in the interviews.

26:01.680 --> 26:04.640
Everyone just mentions these seven people
and the robber.

26:04.720 --> 26:07.360
But eight people left the apartment.

26:07.440 --> 26:09.440
-Of course it's her.
-Why?

26:09.520 --> 26:11.080
She's got a motive. Money.

26:11.160 --> 26:15.000
The agency hasn't sold anything
for six months.

26:15.080 --> 26:18.600
I seem to recall
her personal finances being a disaster.

26:19.400 --> 26:22.480
She's the robber,
and she escaped with the hostages.

26:36.600 --> 26:38.040
Wow, this looks serious.

26:38.120 --> 26:40.120
-Good Lord.
-Yeah.
