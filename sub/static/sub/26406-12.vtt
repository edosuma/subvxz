00:05.902 --> 00:07.201
Attention, Cloud 9 shoppers.

00:07.203 --> 00:08.653
It's really comin' down out there.

00:08.655 --> 00:10.505
Now, I'm not a licensed meteorologist,

00:10.507 --> 00:13.508
but I believe the technical
term is snowy AF.

00:13.510 --> 00:15.343
For anyone stocking up, we are limiting

00:15.345 --> 00:18.012
all water purchases
to one case per person,

00:18.014 --> 00:20.148
and that does include coconut water,

00:20.150 --> 00:22.684
watermelon water, cucumber water,

00:22.686 --> 00:24.786
aloe water, probiotic water,

00:24.788 --> 00:25.787
and electric water,

00:25.789 --> 00:27.088
which is something I just made up

00:27.090 --> 00:28.923
but you probably got all excited about.

00:28.925 --> 00:31.993
And if anybody lost a blue hair thingie,

00:31.995 --> 00:34.462
please come pick it up
at customer service.

00:34.464 --> 00:36.264
Oh, that's mine!

00:36.266 --> 00:37.715
What?

00:53.483 --> 00:55.783
The snow is already at my knees

00:55.785 --> 00:57.952
and shows no signs of slowing.

00:57.954 --> 01:00.872
I know it doesn't look
very high, but, once again,

01:00.874 --> 01:04.659
I'm 6'7", so it would be above the waist

01:04.661 --> 01:06.461
of a normal size person.

01:06.463 --> 01:08.630
So much for global warming.

01:08.632 --> 01:11.633
Actually, this... this
is direct proof of the...

01:11.635 --> 01:13.668
nope, I'm not gonna take the bait.

01:13.670 --> 01:15.336
I knew this blizzard
was coming a week ago

01:15.338 --> 01:17.588
'cause my macaw started having diarrhea.

01:17.590 --> 01:20.708
Don't all birds diarrhea all the time?

01:20.710 --> 01:21.776
Not like this.

01:21.778 --> 01:22.877
- Hey, Glenn?
- Mm-hmm?

01:22.879 --> 01:25.263
Um, it's really bad out there.

01:25.265 --> 01:27.398
Do you think maybe we could
all go home early?

01:27.400 --> 01:29.117
Well, we're supposed
to stay open till 11:00.

01:29.119 --> 01:31.352
Come on, the only people
left in the store are us

01:31.354 --> 01:33.154
and a few sample suckers.

01:33.156 --> 01:34.222
Okay, you know what, yeah,

01:34.224 --> 01:36.591
I could give corporate a call, sure.

01:36.593 --> 01:38.159
So much for global warming, huh?

01:38.161 --> 01:39.927
It's not... it's not global warming.

01:39.929 --> 01:41.112
- It's climate change.
- Shh.

01:41.114 --> 01:42.697
No, but, if anything, this is proof...

01:42.699 --> 01:44.899
- Shh.
- This...

01:48.338 --> 01:50.104
Jerry.

01:50.106 --> 01:51.706
Sandra, hi.

01:52.333 --> 01:54.207
Hi. What are you...

01:54.210 --> 01:56.862
Oh, you are a lifesaver.

01:57.547 --> 01:58.946
Mmm.

01:58.948 --> 02:00.581
I ran out of vape juice.

02:00.583 --> 02:02.183
It's really bad out there.

02:02.185 --> 02:04.252
I hit some ice and almost
skidded into a pet cem...

02:04.254 --> 02:06.704
Oh, this is cotton candy.

02:06.706 --> 02:08.955
I asked you for candy cane.

02:08.958 --> 02:10.625
Oh, sorry.

02:10.627 --> 02:12.160
Whatever.

02:12.162 --> 02:13.961
I guess I don't matter.

02:17.217 --> 02:17.910
Bye.

02:18.702 --> 02:19.867
Bye.

02:22.505 --> 02:24.972
Oh, you look so sad right now.

02:24.974 --> 02:27.241
It's, like, haunting.

02:27.243 --> 02:28.710
Can I take your picture?

02:29.349 --> 02:30.212
Okay.

02:32.215 --> 02:34.649
Oh, now you just look like a sad clown.

02:35.207 --> 02:36.084
I can do it.

02:36.086 --> 02:37.820
No, it's fine. The moment's passed.

02:38.221 --> 02:40.455
It is really coming down out there,

02:40.457 --> 02:43.124
and I'm worried about people
making it home safely.

02:43.126 --> 02:44.892
<i>Oh, of course, the most important thing</i>

02:44.894 --> 02:46.260
<i>is the safety of our employees.</i>

02:46.262 --> 02:48.129
Exactly, so, uh, I was hoping

02:48.131 --> 02:50.631
I could let everyone go a little early?

02:51.044 --> 02:53.117
<i>Oh, wouldn't that be
such a sweet gesture?</i>

02:54.011 --> 02:55.920
Uh-huh, it... it would be, yes.

02:55.922 --> 02:57.939
<i>Well, if you need anything at all,</i>

02:57.941 --> 02:59.073
<i>we're here for you and, uh,</i>

02:59.075 --> 03:01.291
<i>we will be right up until closing time.</i>

03:01.878 --> 03:04.263
So you're saying we can't leave?

03:04.681 --> 03:07.679
<i>I'm saying we appreciate
your commitment to stay.</i>

03:08.418 --> 03:09.400
Thank you.

03:17.460 --> 03:19.093
Attention, all remaining customers.

03:19.095 --> 03:22.063
The governor has declared
a state of emergency.

03:22.065 --> 03:25.733
Customers are advised to get
home before conditions worsen,

03:25.735 --> 03:28.674
which begs the question,
what about employees

03:28.944 --> 03:31.739
who also drive cars
and also have families

03:31.741 --> 03:34.308
and/or video games to get home to?

03:35.715 --> 03:37.524
Yeah, I... I checked on that,

03:37.525 --> 03:40.331
and corporate would like us
to stay until closing so...

03:41.601 --> 03:43.334
Glenn, this is crazy.

03:43.336 --> 03:44.502
It's really bad out there.

03:44.504 --> 03:45.636
Oh, I don't know.

03:45.638 --> 03:48.372
Maybe it's starting to lighten up a bit.

03:48.374 --> 03:50.224
No, actually, it's getting worse.

03:50.226 --> 03:52.710
Uh, they're calling it
the snow-poca-blizz.

03:52.712 --> 03:54.178
Oh, wait, nope, that's
just some guy on Twitter

03:54.180 --> 03:55.312
trying to get it going.

03:55.314 --> 03:57.767
Okay, well, you know,
I'll try 'em again.

03:59.860 --> 04:01.619
Oh, no, no, no, Glenn, no, that's...

04:01.621 --> 04:03.421
you're still using the intercom phone.

04:04.690 --> 04:05.568
- Ow!
- Put it down.

04:05.569 --> 04:07.141
Oh, phooey to corporate.

04:07.143 --> 04:08.826
Let's just get outta here.

04:08.828 --> 04:10.594
You heard the man, go, go!

04:10.596 --> 04:13.124
Okay, before you go,
can you unlock the razor case?

04:13.399 --> 04:15.683
I don't know why you guys
lock up the razor blades.

04:15.985 --> 04:18.369
They're actually one
of the most shoplifted items,

04:18.370 --> 04:19.786
high-ticket and easy to pocket.

04:19.789 --> 04:22.306
People also steal name-brand detergent,

04:22.308 --> 04:23.908
condoms, baby formula.

04:23.910 --> 04:26.077
You wouldn't think it, but
they sell it and buy heroin.

04:26.079 --> 04:29.480
Pretty grim. Anyway, happy to help.

04:29.482 --> 04:30.981
Holy moly!

04:30.983 --> 04:33.197
It is the snow-poca-blizz!

04:33.198 --> 04:35.164
It is colder than the critical reception

04:35.165 --> 04:36.787
of Drake's last album!

04:36.789 --> 04:39.757
That's what you said when
we came out here last night!

04:39.759 --> 04:40.925
Shut up. None of them heard it!

04:40.927 --> 04:42.660
You guys think the bus is running

04:42.662 --> 04:44.345
on its regular schedule?

04:44.347 --> 04:45.579
I doubt it!

04:45.581 --> 04:47.491
But maybe we can split an Uber!

04:47.492 --> 04:49.224
I can't see my car!

04:49.225 --> 04:50.835
I lost one of my shoes!

04:50.837 --> 04:52.837
Maybe we should go back inside!

04:52.839 --> 04:55.040
No, we just have to get to our cars!

04:55.041 --> 04:56.647
Oh, there's surge pricing!

04:56.648 --> 04:58.309
I lost my other shoe!

04:58.311 --> 05:00.444
It costs $1,400!

05:00.446 --> 05:02.627
Okay, we have to go back inside!

05:02.628 --> 05:03.647
We're gonna die out here!

05:03.649 --> 05:05.950
It is colder than the critical reception

05:05.952 --> 05:08.085
of Justin Timberlake's last album!

05:08.087 --> 05:10.588
We heard you the first time!

05:12.566 --> 05:13.731
Well, I just heard an update

05:13.732 --> 05:17.079
on KFR-AM 520 with Bill Mudd,
the Weather Stud...

05:17.080 --> 05:19.380
who, by the way,
if you go to their website,

05:19.382 --> 05:20.715
is far from studly.

05:20.717 --> 05:22.216
Oh, his eyes are on
the side of his head.

05:22.218 --> 05:23.334
- I know.
- Yeah.

05:23.944 --> 05:26.721
Anyway, it looks as though
we are stuck here tonight.

05:26.723 --> 05:27.722
- Oh!
- What?

05:27.724 --> 05:28.723
- What?
- Come on.

05:28.725 --> 05:29.590
So because corporate

05:29.592 --> 05:31.509
couldn't let us home a tad bit earlier,

05:31.511 --> 05:33.761
now I can't get home to my children?

05:34.142 --> 05:36.097
I thought Adam has the kids tonight.

05:36.599 --> 05:39.016
He does. I'm just
trying to make a point.

05:39.018 --> 05:41.040
I was gonna host chili night tonight.

05:41.041 --> 05:43.271
We were gonna host chili night tonight.

05:43.272 --> 05:44.709
Well, it's my apartment.

05:44.710 --> 05:46.092
You're just bringing the chili.

05:46.094 --> 05:47.378
The chili's the whole point.

05:47.471 --> 05:49.171
So we're just supposed
to spend the night here

05:49.173 --> 05:50.089
like homeless people.

05:50.091 --> 05:53.285
Yes, this is the exact sleeping
situation homeless people have.

05:53.569 --> 05:54.559
They wouldn't sleep here.

05:54.560 --> 05:56.693
This place is crawling with raccoons.

05:57.070 --> 05:59.150
I let a homeless guy
use my bathroom once.

05:59.151 --> 06:01.020
Now he just does it
when I'm not even home.

06:01.021 --> 06:04.037
Okay, we have no idea how
long we're gonna be stuck here,

06:04.038 --> 06:05.937
so we need to ration our food.

06:05.938 --> 06:08.299
The less we eat up front,
the longer we can go

06:08.300 --> 06:09.742
before we start eating each other later.

06:09.743 --> 06:11.852
Um, I have a child here.

06:11.853 --> 06:13.162
That is an amazing offer,

06:13.164 --> 06:15.664
but why don't we just try
and get out of here alive

06:15.666 --> 06:17.881
before we start
eating the children, huh?

06:18.085 --> 06:19.785
I... I don't think it'll come to that.

06:19.787 --> 06:21.536
Let's just help ourselves
to whatever we need:

06:21.537 --> 06:23.716
bedding, food, pajamas, you know.

06:23.888 --> 06:26.855
Mi casa is sues mos, wazzas.

06:26.856 --> 06:27.951
Cell phones are out.

06:28.296 --> 06:30.284
Do you have a landline
I can call my family from?

06:30.285 --> 06:32.613
Oh, sure, yeah, you can use
the phone at customer service.

06:32.614 --> 06:34.510
And can I also use it
to call my mistress?

06:37.121 --> 06:39.598
Is... is... is... is she nice?

06:40.141 --> 06:41.075
She's okay.

06:41.726 --> 06:42.811
Well, that's good.

06:59.010 --> 07:01.677
So how have you been?

07:01.892 --> 07:02.610
Good.

07:03.775 --> 07:05.197
Carol doesn't let me eat sugar.

07:06.216 --> 07:08.333
Oh, cool.

07:09.493 --> 07:10.338
You look good.

07:11.005 --> 07:11.849
Thanks.

07:14.237 --> 07:15.482
You look nice too.

07:16.295 --> 07:17.350
Thanks.

07:19.816 --> 07:22.282
I was thinking about getting bangs,

07:23.620 --> 07:24.625
but I didn't.

07:26.129 --> 07:27.033
Hmm.

07:30.574 --> 07:32.435
Where should I set up my stuff?

07:32.436 --> 07:34.258
Oh, anywhere is fine.

07:34.259 --> 07:35.444
Are you crazy?

07:35.446 --> 07:36.445
You know that we're liable

07:36.447 --> 07:38.620
for any assaults that
take place tonight, right?

07:39.033 --> 07:39.716
I...

07:39.717 --> 07:41.750
Now, you need to set up
in the very center of the floor, okay?

07:41.752 --> 07:43.372
We need to keep
the hotties in the middle,

07:43.373 --> 07:44.353
make them harder to get to.

07:44.354 --> 07:46.755
That's how wolves protect
their hottest wolves.

07:46.757 --> 07:47.591
Okay.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.625
Listen, I'm gonna do
everything in my power

07:49.627 --> 07:52.211
to make sure you make it
through the night alive, okay?

07:52.487 --> 07:53.877
Oh, all right, thanks, Dina.

07:55.117 --> 07:56.465
You know, we should really tie bells

07:56.467 --> 07:58.550
to some of the creeps
so we can hear them coming.

07:59.877 --> 08:01.493
No, I'm not gonna make it tonight.

08:01.722 --> 08:04.098
Just enjoy the hotel room.
Watch some HBO.

08:04.392 --> 08:06.616
Use all the blankets.
Take 'em in the shower.

08:06.617 --> 08:08.273
Doesn't cost nothin'.

08:08.274 --> 08:09.875
Just nothing from the minibar.

08:16.037 --> 08:17.580
See, this isn't so bad.

08:17.581 --> 08:19.633
It's like we're all having
a big slumber party.

08:19.634 --> 08:21.710
Ooh, we should do a Ouija board.

08:21.711 --> 08:23.459
Nah, the only dead guy here is Sal,

08:23.461 --> 08:24.743
and I don't want to talk to that dude.

08:24.745 --> 08:26.401
Oh, we could play Spin the Bottle.

08:26.402 --> 08:27.645
I'm awesome at Spin the Bottle.

08:27.646 --> 08:29.026
I can make it spin forever.

08:29.027 --> 08:30.067
It's like a wrist thing.

08:30.068 --> 08:31.446
All right, let's go around

08:31.447 --> 08:33.486
and each of us say
how we lost our virginity.

08:33.488 --> 08:34.419
Oh, no, we don't need to do that.

08:34.422 --> 08:35.986
Okay, for me, it was Mark Benthis.

08:35.986 --> 08:37.278
He was this jock in high school,

08:37.279 --> 08:38.868
and I was tutoring him in English.

08:38.869 --> 08:40.392
So one day, he comes to my house

08:40.394 --> 08:42.250
to study after basketball practice

08:42.251 --> 08:45.747
and he's all sweaty
and one thing leads to another.

08:46.173 --> 08:46.960
Alley-oop.

08:46.961 --> 08:48.484
- Swish.
- That's awesome.

08:48.486 --> 08:49.860
Did you guys date after that?

08:49.861 --> 08:51.665
No, he pretended not to know me,

08:51.666 --> 08:53.388
so I started tutoring him wrong.

08:53.741 --> 08:56.117
If he thought he was dyslexic before...

08:56.827 --> 08:57.752
- Oh.
- Mine was

08:57.753 --> 08:59.748
a French foreign exchange student

08:59.749 --> 09:01.526
my family hosted when I was 16.

09:01.935 --> 09:06.052
After a couple weeks,
it was avoir la petit Mort.

09:06.053 --> 09:07.420
Please tell me that means sex.

09:07.838 --> 09:09.221
Uh, yes.

09:09.540 --> 09:11.816
Yes, awesome. Lucky girl.

09:13.248 --> 09:14.912
Jasmine Mendoza.

09:14.913 --> 09:16.103
- Oh?
- Wow.

09:16.104 --> 09:17.875
I know. I was so freaked out afterwards,

09:17.876 --> 09:19.381
she had to take me
to the emergency room.

09:19.382 --> 09:21.344
- Aww.
- I'm crying.

09:21.345 --> 09:23.599
For me, it was Adam, duh.

09:23.866 --> 09:26.611
It was the night before his
state wrestling championship,

09:26.612 --> 09:27.872
and he begged me because

09:27.873 --> 09:30.225
he didn't want to pop a boner
during his match.

09:30.227 --> 09:31.394
So how'd he do?

09:31.395 --> 09:33.554
He broke his foot
and lost his scholarship.

09:33.555 --> 09:34.296
Ouch.

09:34.297 --> 09:35.314
At least he didn't get a boner.

09:35.316 --> 09:36.999
No, he still did, actually.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.405
To this day, he still calls that

09:38.406 --> 09:40.183
the week of boners that ruined his life.

09:40.384 --> 09:42.071
- Hmm.
- All right, who's next?

09:42.470 --> 09:43.528
Sandra, you go.

09:44.696 --> 09:46.649
Um, what do we do

09:46.650 --> 09:49.543
if the person we did it with is here?

10:03.467 --> 10:06.018
Jesus, your feet are freezing.

10:06.147 --> 10:07.417
Come on. How 'bout now?

10:07.418 --> 10:10.235
No, I... they're like blocks of ice.

10:10.236 --> 10:11.778
Come on, that's your job.

10:11.779 --> 10:13.233
- It's not my job.
- Yes.

10:13.234 --> 10:14.251
Then I quit.

10:14.252 --> 10:15.320
- Stop.
- It's freezing.

10:15.322 --> 10:18.830
Oh, so you guys are sharing a bed.

10:19.504 --> 10:21.587
That's so husband and wife.

10:21.588 --> 10:23.437
Yeah, well, there... there
weren't many mattresses.

10:23.438 --> 10:26.983
Oh, never mind, cool. Cool.

10:26.984 --> 10:28.102
It just...

10:28.103 --> 10:30.002
you know, could you not maybe...

10:31.693 --> 10:33.172
If you could avoid...

10:33.840 --> 10:38.278
Having sex on an air mattress
surrounded by our coworkers?

10:38.279 --> 10:40.232
We will try to contain ourselves.

10:40.598 --> 10:42.029
Oh, okay, great, thank you.

10:43.017 --> 10:43.870
Good night.

10:50.243 --> 10:52.042
- Good night.
- Huh?

10:52.044 --> 10:53.160
Jesus!

10:53.726 --> 10:54.888
Good night, Marcus.

10:57.265 --> 10:57.974
Ah.

11:05.808 --> 11:06.974
No, Glenn, we're okay.

11:06.976 --> 11:08.225
- We don't...
- Oh.

11:08.227 --> 11:09.593
- Oh.
- Yeah, that's cozy.

11:09.595 --> 11:10.261
There we go.

11:10.263 --> 11:13.566
That is... that is comfortable.

11:23.993 --> 11:26.076
- Is this good?
- No, Jerry.

11:26.078 --> 11:26.911
Sorry.

11:26.913 --> 11:30.281
Don't apologize. Just be better.

11:31.868 --> 11:33.617
Sandra, where are you going?

11:33.619 --> 11:35.202
I'm gonna sleep in the break room.

11:35.204 --> 11:36.414
Nobody moves after light's out.

11:36.415 --> 11:37.980
It's for Cheyenne's security.

11:38.597 --> 11:39.701
Oh, okay.

11:41.043 --> 11:42.676
Don't move your arms so much.

11:42.678 --> 11:43.884
Just lie there.

11:53.382 --> 11:54.264
Hey.

11:56.051 --> 11:57.267
Cheyenne, wake up.

11:57.269 --> 11:59.717
Rise and Cheyenne.

12:00.889 --> 12:02.022
Girl, wake up.

12:03.025 --> 12:05.193
Jesus, wake up, you ox!

12:06.895 --> 12:09.612
I think our mattress deflated.

12:09.614 --> 12:11.281
Oh, is that what that sound was?

12:11.283 --> 12:14.171
I thought you were just
continuously farting all night,

12:14.536 --> 12:15.957
which I thought was cute.

12:16.238 --> 12:17.888
Mornin'.

12:18.323 --> 12:19.550
You guys want coffee?

12:20.409 --> 12:22.075
Um, no, that's...

12:22.077 --> 12:24.246
- No, I'm... penis.
- We're okay.

12:24.247 --> 12:25.700
- Thanks.
- All right.

12:29.835 --> 12:31.751
Oh, hey, do you guys
wanna come for breakfast?

12:31.753 --> 12:33.753
It's Thursday, so we're
having waffle sticks

12:33.755 --> 12:36.756
and pancake rollovers
and French toast poppers.

12:36.758 --> 12:38.425
Yeah, I think we've spent enough time

12:38.427 --> 12:40.169
with each other for a while.

12:43.600 --> 12:45.482
That is a lot of snow.

12:45.484 --> 12:47.434
Yes! I told you!

12:47.436 --> 12:49.180
I said we need to ration our food

12:49.181 --> 12:50.770
because we may be stuck
in there for a while,

12:50.772 --> 12:52.439
but did any of you listen to me?

12:52.441 --> 12:55.358
Nope, and now we very well
may starve to death.

12:55.360 --> 12:58.111
In your faces!

12:58.113 --> 12:59.913
Boom! Always right.

12:59.915 --> 13:01.638
Another one for the good guys.

13:03.535 --> 13:05.668
Sorry, baby, I'm just
gonna be a few more hours.

13:05.670 --> 13:08.171
Um, hey, uh, don't
eat the free breakfast

13:08.173 --> 13:09.756
and see if they'll
credit it to the room.

13:09.758 --> 13:12.214
And, uh, you didn't do laundry, did you?

13:12.794 --> 13:13.877
Okay, mention that.

13:13.879 --> 13:16.379
Would you mention that
you didn't do any laundry?

13:19.518 --> 13:24.354
Okay, um, how about what
is the most embarrassing way

13:24.356 --> 13:26.806
you've ever injured yourself?

13:26.808 --> 13:27.598
Go.

13:28.610 --> 13:31.561
Uh, about ten years ago,
I tried to run a marathon,

13:31.563 --> 13:33.813
and I made it almost the entire way,

13:33.815 --> 13:36.282
but three feet before the finish line,

13:36.284 --> 13:38.451
I passed out from dehydration.

13:38.453 --> 13:40.036
Wait, how is that embarrassing?

13:40.038 --> 13:43.490
That's just bragging that you
finished most of a marathon.

13:43.492 --> 13:45.458
I chipped my tooth
biting a chocolate coin

13:45.460 --> 13:47.377
that turned out to just be a quarter.

13:47.379 --> 13:48.411
And then another time,

13:48.413 --> 13:51.631
I fell up an escalator
when I was taking a selfie.

13:51.633 --> 13:54.348
I got my penis caught
in my friend Russell's zipper.

13:54.588 --> 13:55.218
Oh.

13:55.547 --> 13:56.920
I'm sorry, I just gotta...

13:56.922 --> 13:58.505
where was Russell's penis?

13:58.507 --> 14:00.340
For a while, neither of us knew.

14:00.342 --> 14:02.425
I slipped in the shower once.

14:02.427 --> 14:04.010
That's not that embarrassing.

14:04.012 --> 14:04.676
Oh, yeah?

14:04.829 --> 14:07.280
'Cause I slipped on my own poop.

14:07.803 --> 14:09.315
- What?
- Why?

14:09.787 --> 14:11.101
I had just deuced in the shower.

14:11.103 --> 14:12.685
- Ugh.
- Ugh.

14:12.687 --> 14:13.499
Why?

14:13.500 --> 14:15.522
Okay, right, when you guys
are in the shower

14:15.524 --> 14:17.907
and you have to go, you just hold it.

14:17.909 --> 14:19.086
Yes. Yeah.

14:19.300 --> 14:22.162
That's what you do
when it's a number two.

14:22.164 --> 14:25.915
Sure, so you don't poop
in the shower every morning

14:25.917 --> 14:27.617
and stamp it down the drain
with your feet?

14:27.619 --> 14:28.945
Oh, my God.

14:28.946 --> 14:30.496
- Oh, my...
- No.

14:30.497 --> 14:33.339
Okay, whatever. Screw you, snowflakes.

14:33.703 --> 14:35.092
Bunch of princesses.

14:44.339 --> 14:46.519
All right, we've narrowed it
down to two choices:

14:46.859 --> 14:48.388
"Game of Thrones" season one

14:48.390 --> 14:49.722
or "Friends" season nine.

14:49.724 --> 14:51.357
Is that the season with Paul Rudd?

14:51.359 --> 14:53.059
Uh, I believe so, yeah.

14:53.061 --> 14:53.840
Pass.

14:53.840 --> 14:54.802
My son's six.

14:54.803 --> 14:56.279
"Game of Thrones" has too much nudity.

14:56.527 --> 14:57.776
I feel like both those shows

14:57.778 --> 14:59.278
have way too many white people.

14:59.280 --> 15:00.104
Yeah, I got to agree.

15:00.105 --> 15:02.564
I watch TV as an escape,
not to see more white people.

15:02.566 --> 15:05.359
Well, I could watch something
with a little more diversity.

15:05.820 --> 15:07.035
How about "Empire"?

15:07.637 --> 15:09.019
Gonna start right in the deep end, huh?

15:09.020 --> 15:12.074
Guys, there are two DVDs:

15:12.076 --> 15:15.238
"Game of Thrones" season one,
"Friends" season nine.

15:15.546 --> 15:16.378
That's it.

15:16.380 --> 15:18.247
It has to be one of those choices.

15:18.916 --> 15:19.998
You know, I've always wanted to watch

15:20.000 --> 15:21.013
"Orange Is the New Black."

15:21.014 --> 15:21.847
I'd watch that.

15:21.848 --> 15:23.836
I thought you said your son
couldn't watch nudity.

15:23.838 --> 15:25.250
He likes strong female leads.

15:26.590 --> 15:29.763
Just a little more color on your cheeks.

15:31.429 --> 15:32.188
There.

15:32.961 --> 15:33.898
How do I look?

15:34.936 --> 15:35.904
You look good.

15:37.351 --> 15:37.920
Really?

15:38.195 --> 15:40.192
I think he looks like his whore sister.

16:01.208 --> 16:04.221
Ah!

16:04.222 --> 16:05.544
Can you stop doing that?

16:05.546 --> 16:06.032
What?

16:06.033 --> 16:08.816
That "ah" you do every time you move.

16:08.817 --> 16:09.546
It bugs.

16:09.547 --> 16:11.336
I'm sorry. I didn't realize I did that.

16:11.669 --> 16:14.355
Let me know if I'm doing
anything else that "bugs."

16:14.356 --> 16:16.972
Um, those bunny ears with your hands

16:16.974 --> 16:18.457
when you talk are annoying.

16:18.458 --> 16:19.633
Um, noted.

16:19.634 --> 16:22.868
Um, I'll try not to do
anything else, um, annoying

16:22.869 --> 16:24.172
when I, um, talk.

16:24.173 --> 16:25.036
Thank you.

16:25.037 --> 16:26.565
He's making fun of you, Cheyenne,

16:26.567 --> 16:28.597
because he thinks he's better
than everyone else here.

16:28.598 --> 16:31.234
Oh, I'm sorry, he thinks
he's better than everyone?

16:31.572 --> 16:33.739
You're the one who walks into
the break room every morning

16:33.741 --> 16:36.391
and says, "Good morning, turd people."

16:36.877 --> 16:38.257
It wasn't funny the first time.

16:38.258 --> 16:39.628
It's not supposed to be funny.

16:39.630 --> 16:41.846
It's supposed to make you feel
bad for being turd people.

16:41.847 --> 16:43.194
Okay, guys, come on.

16:43.195 --> 16:45.314
Let's be nice to each other, you know.

16:45.315 --> 16:46.385
Spending all this time together

16:46.387 --> 16:48.187
can make us a little bit bonkers.

16:48.188 --> 16:48.845
It's true.

16:48.846 --> 16:51.047
Do you know how many murders
happen on submarines?

16:51.048 --> 16:51.607
Okay, great.

16:51.608 --> 16:52.992
Well, then let's all
stop annoying each other

16:52.993 --> 16:54.156
and nobody has to get hurt.

16:54.157 --> 16:57.095
What if we don't know what
we're doing that's annoying?

16:57.097 --> 16:58.180
Paradox.

16:58.182 --> 17:00.518
Maybe we should go around
and each say something

17:00.519 --> 17:01.941
about someone that annoys us.

17:01.942 --> 17:04.105
Mm, that sounds like a real bad idea.

17:04.106 --> 17:06.488
"That sounds like a real bad idea."

17:06.490 --> 17:07.489
Who am I?

17:07.491 --> 17:09.242
Oh! Amy. Easy.

17:09.242 --> 17:11.442
Okay, fine, let's do this.

17:11.443 --> 17:14.503
Uh, Mateo, when you say "touché,"

17:14.505 --> 17:16.619
you sound like a douché.

17:16.894 --> 17:17.775
Who's next?

17:25.080 --> 17:27.156
You don't know how
to tell a story, Glenn.

17:27.157 --> 17:28.499
You get lost in the details,

17:28.501 --> 17:30.053
like whatever people
were having for lunch.

17:30.054 --> 17:31.619
I am trying to paint a picture.

17:31.621 --> 17:34.598
Nobody cares if it
doesn't impact the story.

17:34.599 --> 17:36.688
I hate Mateo's anticlimactic sneezes.

17:36.689 --> 17:39.594
It's a lot of build-up
for a tiny, little "achoo."

17:39.596 --> 17:41.664
Yeah, and it's always, like,
three or four of them in a row.

17:41.665 --> 17:43.410
He just likes the attention.

17:43.411 --> 17:45.281
Isaac, you need
to stop calling me brother.

17:45.282 --> 17:46.291
I don't do that.

17:46.292 --> 17:47.401
You do. I've heard it.

17:47.402 --> 17:49.702
Okay, maybe, but I don't
do it to sound cool.

17:49.703 --> 17:50.939
I do it 'cause you're black.

17:50.941 --> 17:52.874
Garrett, your breath smells like farts,

17:52.876 --> 17:54.804
and your farts smell like food.

17:54.805 --> 17:55.893
You need to see a doctor.

17:55.895 --> 17:58.431
And, Marcus, why do you
smell like sour milk?

17:58.432 --> 18:00.453
I eat cereal while I drive to work,

18:00.454 --> 18:02.150
and most of the time, it spills.

18:02.152 --> 18:04.660
Dina, your voice is a smidge loud.

18:04.661 --> 18:06.582
Well, I'm so sorry that I have

18:06.583 --> 18:08.681
an unusually large diaphragm!

18:08.682 --> 18:10.501
That makes two of us! Up top!

18:10.502 --> 18:12.543
Get your [bleep]ing hand out of my face!

18:12.545 --> 18:13.774
Speaking of loud,

18:13.775 --> 18:15.229
when Amy chews chips,

18:15.230 --> 18:17.879
it sounds like
she's eating a microphone.

18:20.837 --> 18:23.042
Aren't you just, like, a customer?

18:23.043 --> 18:25.103
Yeah, I'm Terry.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.190
Hi, Terry.

18:26.191 --> 18:27.396
Shut the hell up.

18:27.397 --> 18:28.945
Yeah, you're not a part of this.

18:28.946 --> 18:29.912
This is Cloud 9.

18:29.913 --> 18:31.346
We don't give a damn
what customers think.

18:31.348 --> 18:34.332
Yeah, why don't you
go stew in softlines?

18:34.333 --> 18:35.984
- Bye-bye.
- Yeah, get out of here.

18:35.986 --> 18:37.185
- Bye.
- Okay, okay.

18:37.187 --> 18:38.353
Bye.

18:38.355 --> 18:39.621
Can you believe that guy,

18:39.622 --> 18:41.830
barging in here
like he's part of the family?

18:41.831 --> 18:43.766
Guys, guys, who am I?

18:43.767 --> 18:45.279
"I'm Terry."

18:48.768 --> 18:51.532
Yeah, that's exactly
what he sounds like.

18:51.534 --> 18:52.867
So good.

18:52.869 --> 18:54.657
Nailed it.

18:54.658 --> 18:57.327
Okay, so if I had to eat someone here,

18:57.328 --> 19:00.566
it would be... Glenn

19:00.760 --> 19:03.511
'cause he eats a lot of sugar,
so he'd be the sweetest.

19:03.513 --> 19:04.489
Aw, thank you.

19:04.490 --> 19:06.446
My blood sugar is really high.

19:06.447 --> 19:07.715
I'm prediabetic.

19:07.717 --> 19:10.686
Personally, I wouldn't eat
anyone over the age of 35.

19:10.687 --> 19:12.603
I know there's no
expiration date on people,

19:13.038 --> 19:14.592
but that's when they start to turn.

19:14.593 --> 19:16.930
Oh, Jenga!

19:16.931 --> 19:17.942
- Yes!
- Jenga!

19:17.944 --> 19:19.527
- That's a Jenga.
- Yas, Jenga.

19:19.529 --> 19:21.112
- Cheers.
- That's a Jenga.

19:21.114 --> 19:22.113
Nice.

19:25.068 --> 19:27.367
Okay, okay, well, it's a cherry cola.

19:27.787 --> 19:30.714
The acidity is too intense
for Coca-Cola Cherry,

19:30.715 --> 19:33.479
and it's not quite full-bodied enough

19:33.480 --> 19:35.201
to be Cloud 9 Cherry Splash.

19:36.746 --> 19:37.953
RC Cherry Cola.

19:38.598 --> 19:40.026
It's Bud Light Lime.

19:40.027 --> 19:41.527
Oh, yeah.

19:42.241 --> 19:43.413
Yeah, I'm getting that.

19:46.138 --> 19:47.212
Yes!

19:47.213 --> 19:48.604
How are you so good?

19:48.605 --> 19:51.091
You never golfed before,
like, a year ago.

19:51.728 --> 19:52.775
I never big golfed,

19:52.776 --> 19:54.421
but I used to mini golf all the time.

19:54.814 --> 19:55.585
Big golfed?

19:56.316 --> 19:56.904
Yeah.

19:57.100 --> 19:58.816
If we make it out of here alive,

19:58.818 --> 20:00.512
I might take you to
my favorite mini golf place.

20:00.513 --> 20:01.956
You're not sick of me yet?

20:03.602 --> 20:05.613
No. Are you sick of me?

20:07.764 --> 20:08.385
Nah.

20:10.349 --> 20:12.280
What about now? Are you sick of me now?

20:13.188 --> 20:13.872
Um.

20:13.873 --> 20:15.275
Is this making you sick of me?

20:15.276 --> 20:15.713
Well.

20:17.169 --> 20:18.453
Breath smells like farts.

20:18.455 --> 20:20.288
I'm sure my breath
doesn't smell like farts.

20:20.888 --> 20:22.673
Oh, hey, excuse me, man.
Is this place open?

20:22.675 --> 20:24.008
How'd you get in here?

20:24.010 --> 20:25.293
Just through the doors.

20:25.295 --> 20:26.794
Did they plow the parking lot?

20:26.796 --> 20:27.845
I guess so.

20:27.847 --> 20:29.097
Oh, thank God.

20:29.099 --> 20:30.181
I mean, it's kind of cold outside.

20:30.183 --> 20:32.340
You might want to put on...
No, I'm good. I'm good.

20:32.341 --> 20:33.692
Whoo!

20:42.312 --> 20:46.934
The trick is to take a box out

20:47.450 --> 20:51.223
without knocking over
the rest of the tower.

20:51.224 --> 20:52.526
Whoa.

20:52.527 --> 20:54.393
- Yep, that's the trick.
- Cool.

20:54.394 --> 20:55.361
We're out of orange juice.

20:55.362 --> 20:57.452
I got a secret stash in my office.

20:57.453 --> 20:58.359
On it.

21:05.001 --> 21:05.717
Dina.

21:06.803 --> 21:07.635
Hi, Dina.

21:08.289 --> 21:10.372
I was just coming to get some juice,

21:11.324 --> 21:13.056
but, um, think I'll just
drink it straight.

21:13.057 --> 21:13.920
Okay.

21:14.305 --> 21:20.559
