is making this a race against
the clock to pull it off.

10:58.225 --> 11:00.692
Alex: Hopefully the road
is open.

11:00.694 --> 11:03.395
It's still, I think it's still
cool enough to go right now

11:03.397 --> 11:05.363
but depending how much it
warms up today.

11:06.299 --> 11:09.367
Narrator: If temperatures rise
above -6 degrees

11:09.369 --> 11:11.636
authorities will shut down
the trail

11:11.638 --> 11:15.340
and force drivers to wait
until it cools down.

11:15.342 --> 11:17.142
- The concern is that
I might not be able

11:17.144 --> 11:19.010
to go on the road
if it's too warm

11:19.012 --> 11:22.447
because then it's,
we could wreck the road

11:22.449 --> 11:24.349
and we're right there
at the edge.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.284
It's been a very iffy year.

11:26.286 --> 11:28.219
We've got a lot less
winter left.

11:30.757 --> 11:32.090
(truck rattles)

11:33.393 --> 11:37.829
♪♪♪

11:37.831 --> 11:39.197
I'm almost at the winter road.

11:39.199 --> 11:42.133
I'm really hoping
it's cold enough.

11:43.070 --> 11:44.969
It looks pretty soft though.

11:48.408 --> 11:50.475
But um, I haven't said
my prayers.

11:51.411 --> 11:54.746
"our father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

11:54.748 --> 11:57.082
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done

11:57.084 --> 11:59.250
on earth as it is in heaven.

11:59.252 --> 12:00.852
Give us this day
our daily bread

12:00.854 --> 12:02.787
and forgive us our trespasses

12:02.789 --> 12:05.590
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

12:07.094 --> 12:08.560
Amen."

12:10.230 --> 12:12.764
we got our fingers
and our toes crossed.

12:12.766 --> 12:14.599
There's the winter road
right here.

12:17.104 --> 12:19.003
Saint theresa point closed.

12:19.005 --> 12:20.238
(bleep).

12:23.610 --> 12:26.878
Ohhh. I guess we can't go
anywhere.

12:33.186 --> 12:34.686
Ohhh.

12:36.790 --> 12:38.823
I guess we can't go anywhere.

12:41.995 --> 12:45.330
Narrator: The temperatures
crept above -6°

12:45.332 --> 12:48.199
and authorities have closed
the road for travel.

12:49.136 --> 12:52.370
Alex: I don't get paid for
waiting I get paid by the trip.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.239
So waiting's not to my advantage

12:54.241 --> 12:57.041
and of course it's not to
the community's advantage.

12:57.043 --> 12:59.210
Narrator: With the load due
by 9:00 a.M.

13:00.981 --> 13:03.014
And 200 miles still to go

13:03.016 --> 13:06.618
alex, polar and the village
could be out of luck.

13:08.054 --> 13:09.754

alex: Well, this is not a good
thing, you know,

13:11.324 --> 13:12.724
this day is gonna be wasted

13:12.726 --> 13:15.360
because it's gonna take until
midnight

13:15.362 --> 13:18.530
if it cools down before the
roads good enough to drive on.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.599
Narrator: The veterans
forced to wait

13:21.601 --> 13:25.436
with the vital haul sitting
and time quickly slipping away.

13:26.573 --> 13:29.674
Alex: Hopefully it cools down
for everybody's sake.

13:30.911 --> 13:32.243
Narrator: Meanwhile...

13:33.747 --> 13:35.847
Back at headquarters.

13:35.849 --> 13:38.716
Mark's looking to get another
truck out fast.

13:39.653 --> 13:42.053
Mark: I've got a new community
that's um,

13:42.055 --> 13:44.722
taking a chance on polar uh,
it's summer beaver ontario.

13:44.724 --> 13:46.424
- Okay.

13:46.426 --> 13:48.092
Narrator: And he's calling on
his wild card

13:48.094 --> 13:51.129
to break new ground
for the company.

13:51.131 --> 13:53.865
- And uh, they've actually
requested you specifically.

13:55.135 --> 13:57.001
- What, they want,
they want me to take it, like?

13:57.003 --> 13:58.670
- They want you to take
the first load that,

13:58.672 --> 14:00.138
that polar does
for the community.

14:00.140 --> 14:02.040
- I'm honored, b'y.
- Represent us well.

14:02.042 --> 14:03.842
- Oh yeah. I'll enjoy this.
- All right. Okay.

14:03.844 --> 14:05.176
- Right on, buddy.
- Thanks, art.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.778
- Okay.
- Okay, we'll talk to you soon.

14:06.780 --> 14:07.879
- Right on, buddy.
- Be safe.

14:07.881 --> 14:09.013
- Take care.

14:09.015 --> 14:11.115
Narrator: When art first
joined polar...

14:11.117 --> 14:12.450
- Can you start right away?

14:12.452 --> 14:13.484
- Right away.

14:13.486 --> 14:14.853
- I'll uh, officially welcome
you aboard.

14:16.256 --> 14:17.856
Art: I jack knifed
the truck, buddy.

14:17.858 --> 14:20.792
Narrator: It took him awhile
to find his footing.

14:20.794 --> 14:22.193
Mark: What am I supposed
to do with this?

14:23.363 --> 14:25.997
(siren wails)
art: Did you hear that?

14:25.999 --> 14:28.466
(siren wails)
the dot is behind us

14:28.468 --> 14:30.168
with the lights on
and everything.

14:32.906 --> 14:37.342
Alex: Well, art we just ran out
of road, so we're (bleep).

14:37.344 --> 14:39.911
- It never (bleep) ends.

14:40.847 --> 14:43.481
Narrator: But over the years
his reputation's grown

14:43.483 --> 14:45.717
and he's become one of the most
respected drivers

14:45.719 --> 14:48.453
in the winter roads community.

14:48.455 --> 14:49.988
Art: Yeah, we made her, buddy.

14:49.990 --> 14:51.689
Ah, you're making me look
good again.

14:51.691 --> 14:53.658
Man: I know, it's unreal.
- (laughs)

14:56.763 --> 14:58.763
- I got a new position now, b'y.

14:58.765 --> 15:00.531
I went from the wild card

15:00.533 --> 15:02.634
to the ambassador overnight.

15:02.636 --> 15:04.302
That's good I can handle that.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.872
Narrator: For polar's maiden
voyage to the remote village,

15:09.142 --> 15:12.210
art will have to grind out
nearly 500 miles

15:12.212 --> 15:16.347
over a narrow trail notorious
for its twists and turns.

15:20.553 --> 15:22.887
- I'm heading into summer
beaver here this morning.

15:22.889 --> 15:24.656
I have never been in here
before.

15:24.658 --> 15:26.324
So I don't know what's gonna
happen up ahead.

15:26.326 --> 15:28.726
I don't know what the road's
like or anything like this.

15:28.728 --> 15:32.430
So we're just gonna mosey along
here and hope for the best.

the roads are coming apart.

(truck rattling)

15:46.713 --> 15:47.845
not to mention this

15:47.847 --> 15:50.882
I'm getting the (bleep) pounded
out of me here.

15:50.884 --> 15:52.884
The road is not much wider
than my hips.

bang, bang, crash, bang,
bang, smash, crash, bang

16:02.295 --> 16:04.128
all day long.

16:04.130 --> 16:05.697
But we gotta get her done.

16:25.051 --> 16:27.785
finally makes it to her first
destination.

16:32.859 --> 16:34.492

of the job,

16:34.494 --> 16:37.295
hauling two abandoned trailers
back to winnipeg,

16:37.297 --> 16:39.564
means the hard work
is just beginning.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.268
When the melt comes each season

16:44.270 --> 16:45.870
equipment that can't make it out

16:45.872 --> 16:48.239
is forced to be left behind.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.743
And as the muskeg thaws
and refreezes

16:51.745 --> 16:54.345
it becomes a challenge
to recover.

the team will have to get
their hands dirty.

33:32.511 --> 33:34.711
Let's (bleep) keep a steady
speed.

33:34.713 --> 33:37.147
Keep a steady speed, darrell.

33:37.149 --> 33:39.116
(ice cracking)

33:45.391 --> 33:46.823
uh-oh.

33:48.627 --> 33:50.060
Right here coming off the ice

33:50.062 --> 33:53.030
is usually where the ice is
thinnest and the weakest.

33:53.032 --> 33:54.598
(ice cracking)

33:59.938 --> 34:02.472
I'm off, I'm off the ice
crossing.

34:04.176 --> 34:06.276
Narrator: Once across...

34:06.278 --> 34:08.779
Darrell rolls into the tiny
village...

34:09.815 --> 34:13.450
Darrell: Just arrived in
the old elk island lodge.

34:13.452 --> 34:16.286
Narrator: ...And delivers big
for his young company.

34:16.288 --> 34:18.088
- Hey, good enough.
Thanks.

34:20.726 --> 34:21.958
Right on.

34:21.960 --> 34:24.127
Just met up with the boys
that'll unload me in the morning

34:24.129 --> 34:26.363
and I'm gonna kick back
tonight, kick my feet up,

34:26.365 --> 34:28.131
get this trailer unloaded
in the morning

34:28.133 --> 34:29.666
and get out of here.

34:33.105 --> 34:35.138
Narrator: While darrell calls
it a night...

34:37.242 --> 34:39.476
In the manitoba wilderness...

34:39.478 --> 34:42.345
(engine hums)

34:48.454 --> 34:49.853
(truck rattles)

34:50.923 --> 34:52.656
narrator: Steph custance
and todd dewy,

34:52.658 --> 34:55.826
are on the rocky home stretch
of their marathon journey.

34:57.329 --> 35:01.298
- Finally this adventure is
just about coming to an end.

35:01.300 --> 35:04.534
We got our loads, we got
to rescue the trailers.

35:04.536 --> 35:07.704
Narrator: But even the last few
miles aren't coming easy.

35:09.108 --> 35:11.241
(truck rattles)
- oh, (bleep).

35:13.078 --> 35:14.444
- Man, you can't take your eyes
off this road

35:14.446 --> 35:17.581
for like one second,
like actually.

35:17.583 --> 35:18.748
Like I can't even look out
my window

35:18.750 --> 35:20.817
to do it up or down or whatever

35:20.819 --> 35:23.987
without (bleep) coming to the
next bump or curb or tree or...

35:27.126 --> 35:28.758
- This is the end of
the road right here.

35:34.366 --> 35:35.665
Narrator: Finally...

35:36.702 --> 35:39.836
The team reaches the end
of the winter road.

35:39.838 --> 35:42.305
- You made your first full
ice road in and out.

35:44.176 --> 35:45.842
Narrator: And the rookies
first trip

35:45.844 --> 35:48.645
a 1000 mile, 45 hour odyssey
is in the books.

35:50.782 --> 35:53.717
- (emotional) I really can't
even describe this feeling.

35:53.719 --> 35:55.685
Thank you so much, todd.

35:55.687 --> 35:57.821
- You actually drove a big rig
for the first time

35:57.823 --> 36:01.324
in places where a lot of guys
don't even begin

36:01.326 --> 36:02.826
to even try to drive trucks.

36:02.828 --> 36:04.227
- (happy crying)

36:05.364 --> 36:07.364
- she's got a lot of drive,
she's got a lot of heart

36:07.366 --> 36:09.833
and she really strived
really hard to prove to me

36:09.835 --> 36:11.535
that she's got what it takes.

36:12.771 --> 36:15.605
- I'm a real ice road trucker.
(laughs)

36:15.607 --> 36:16.907
(elated laugh)

36:18.110 --> 36:19.442
- but you still got a lot
to learn.

36:19.444 --> 36:21.845
There's a long road ahead of ya.

36:28.053 --> 36:29.886
Narrator: Throughout the north

36:29.888 --> 36:32.489
all the drivers are off
the road...

36:32.491 --> 36:34.558
(wind gusts)

36:34.560 --> 36:37.494
except for one.

36:37.496 --> 36:39.262
(snoring)

36:40.532 --> 36:42.232
alex: Hopefully the road
is open.

36:42.234 --> 36:45.602
I might not be able to go on
the road if it's too warm.

36:45.604 --> 36:47.470
Narrator: On a time sensitive
mission...

36:48.407 --> 36:50.307
Alex: Saint theresa point
closed.

36:50.309 --> 36:51.875
(bleep).

36:51.877 --> 36:54.211
Narrator: ...The road to saint
theresa point was closed

36:54.213 --> 36:56.413
due to warming temperatures.

36:57.349 --> 37:00.417
- Ohhh, I guess we can't go
anywhere.

37:02.321 --> 37:03.853
Narrator: Since then

37:03.855 --> 37:07.357
alex's been shut down
for over 10 hours.

37:07.359 --> 37:09.226
(snoring)

37:09.228 --> 37:11.661
(phone rings)

37:14.233 --> 37:16.066
- oh, that must be mark.

37:19.338 --> 37:20.637
Hello?

37:20.639 --> 37:22.005
- Hey alex.

37:22.007 --> 37:24.307
Yeah, I just checked everything
out uh, you're good to go now.

37:24.309 --> 37:26.443
- No kidding. Great.

37:26.445 --> 37:28.311
- Yep, thanks. Bye-bye.

37:31.083 --> 37:32.983
- I can go.

37:32.985 --> 37:34.684
Thank goodness for that.

37:36.021 --> 37:37.287
Narrator: The good news,

37:37.289 --> 37:39.155
temperatures have finally
dipped low enough

37:39.157 --> 37:41.258
to open the road.

37:41.260 --> 37:44.494
The bad news, with the haul
due at 9:00 a.M.

37:44.496 --> 37:48.231
Alex will have to drive over
200 miles through the night

37:48.233 --> 37:50.367
to deliver on time.

37:50.369 --> 37:53.203
Alex: I don't have any choice
but to drive all night.

37:53.205 --> 37:55.305
(truck rattles)

37:55.307 --> 37:57.274
one of the priorities of making
this trip,

37:57.276 --> 37:59.476
was keeping the load
on the truck.

37:59.478 --> 38:01.444
It looks a little chewed up.

38:01.446 --> 38:03.113
Looks like it's been taking
some sun

38:03.115 --> 38:04.447
and it's been getting beat up.

38:05.984 --> 38:08.918
Narrator: The days warm
weather has melted the road

38:08.920 --> 38:12.155
exposing the rocky muskeg below.

38:12.157 --> 38:15.191
- Made the road rougher
than when it's ice on it.

38:15.193 --> 38:17.794
Narrator: ...Making for
a brutal ride.

38:17.796 --> 38:19.129
(truck rattles)
- whoa.

38:22.801 --> 38:23.933
It is rough.

38:24.936 --> 38:26.569
Up and down, side to side,

38:26.571 --> 38:28.905
big moguls, potholes, ruts,

38:30.575 --> 38:32.676
you get to bounce through
all of it.

38:32.678 --> 38:33.576
(truck rattles)

38:33.578 --> 38:35.211
it hurts when it hits you.

38:38.450 --> 38:41.051
I have a miscellaneous load uh,

38:41.053 --> 38:43.753
something that could be easy
to shake apart.

38:45.357 --> 38:46.923
(truck rattles)
whoa!

38:48.026 --> 38:49.192
I'm gonna have to keep
an eye on it

38:49.194 --> 38:50.560
make sure it doesn't come apart.

38:50.562 --> 38:53.196
I'll have a big mess back there
and probably on the road too.

38:53.198 --> 38:55.298
And I'll be spending the night
picking everything up.

38:56.301 --> 38:58.301
(engine hums)

39:00.972 --> 39:03.039
narrator: As night turns
to day...

39:03.041 --> 39:04.908
(wind gusts)

39:07.879 --> 39:09.279
alex: Well, I've driven through
the night

39:09.281 --> 39:10.914
and I'm really tired.

39:10.916 --> 39:13.683
Narrator: Alex is still pushing
forward...

39:13.685 --> 39:15.151
(chains clink, truck rattles)

39:15.153 --> 39:17.587
- owie, owie, owie, owie, owie.

39:17.589 --> 39:19.055
Narrator: ...Determined
to deliver the load

39:19.057 --> 39:21.091
by the 9:00 a.M. Deadline

39:21.093 --> 39:23.360
and the clock's a-ticking.

39:25.530 --> 39:27.697
- It's not over yet.

39:27.699 --> 39:29.399
Sucker for punishment.

39:30.435 --> 39:32.469
It's warming up.

39:32.471 --> 39:34.137
It's close to where
we can't drive

39:34.139 --> 39:36.639
but I'm determined
to get over there

39:36.641 --> 39:38.241
and get this load delivered.

39:38.243 --> 39:42.645
♪♪♪

39:42.647 --> 39:44.981
(truck rattles)
- whoa! It's rough.

39:44.983 --> 39:46.316
(truck rattles)

39:47.753 --> 39:49.786
whoa!

39:50.889 --> 39:52.756
This is a nightmare.

39:57.562 --> 39:59.796
Narrator: Finally...

39:59.798 --> 40:02.465
Alex: Here we are saint eresa
point.

40:02.467 --> 40:05.135
Narrator: ...Alex arrives
at the small village

40:05.137 --> 40:06.803
just in time.

40:07.806 --> 40:08.905
- I'm relieved to be here.

40:08.907 --> 40:10.673
That's quite the job getting
here this time.

40:11.810 --> 40:15.044
Narrator: And despite the
challenges of the warmest
season in years,

40:15.046 --> 40:16.646
the legend comes through

40:16.648 --> 40:19.682
for polar and
for the community.

40:19.684 --> 40:21.751
Alex: I was worried about
the load but it held together.

40:21.753 --> 40:23.286
(beeping, clank)

40:23.288 --> 40:26.222
an eventful journey but this
trip's taken way too long.

40:26.224 --> 40:28.792
When I'm sitting waiting due
to weather

40:28.794 --> 40:30.260
it's always to do
with patience.

40:30.262 --> 40:32.862
And there's some things
I don't have control over

40:32.864 --> 40:35.031
I have to hand off to god.

40:35.033 --> 40:37.300
But it's always a sense
of satisfaction

40:37.302 --> 40:40.603
once that load is off the truck
I'm done.

40:40.605 --> 40:43.506
That in itself is like winning
a prize.

40:43.508 --> 40:45.275
(laughing)

40:48.914 --> 40:51.381
narrator: Next time on
"ice road truckers"...

40:51.383 --> 40:53.349
(truck rattles)
todd: Hang on.

40:53.351 --> 40:55.785
(thud)
- whoa!

40:55.787 --> 40:58.788
Narrator: ...The trails are
packed with surprises...

40:58.790 --> 41:00.924
Art: Holy (bleep), man,
look down there.

41:00.926 --> 41:02.992
I think we're on an ice
crossing here.

41:02.994 --> 41:06.129
When I say bail,
you (bleep) well bail.

41:06.131 --> 41:09.299
Narrator: ...As the drivers
dive into the melt.

41:09.301 --> 41:11.901
- Hear the ice cracking
and popping.

41:11.903 --> 41:13.036
Narrator: ...Feet first.

41:13.038 --> 41:14.571
Alex: See a little bit
of water on-

41:14.573 --> 41:16.706
whoa! Oh!
