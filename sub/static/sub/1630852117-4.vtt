WEBVTT

00:38.538 --> 00:39.581
Nobody comes in.

00:39.664 --> 00:41.374
-Hey. Hey, what happened?

00:42.250 --> 00:43.668
<i> I followed you last night.</i>

00:43.752 --> 00:44.919
You okay?

00:45.003 --> 00:48.048
I'm here, I can fix whatever this is.
Just tell me what happened.

00:48.131 --> 00:50.675
<i>Because, um, you were occupied.</i>

00:51.426 --> 00:54.095
-I said keep it locked down! Herschel!
-I'm sorry.

00:54.179 --> 00:55.013
Okay, fine.

00:55.096 --> 00:56.389
<i> Dumping that body.</i>

00:56.473 --> 00:59.559
-What do you wanna do?
-I'm just doing my job.

00:59.642 --> 01:03.021
-Your job is to protect him from fans.
-What the fuck you think I'm doing?

01:03.104 --> 01:05.899
Hey! This is not helping!
Both of you, out!

01:05.982 --> 01:07.400
This is a fucking shitshow.

01:09.027 --> 01:10.403
Fuck!

01:10.487 --> 01:12.197
Shut the fuck up!

01:12.280 --> 01:13.114
Damn!

01:17.035 --> 01:17.869
Kid!

01:17.952 --> 01:18.787
Excuse me.

01:19.496 --> 01:20.622
Yo, Kid. Stop!

01:20.705 --> 01:21.706
Get the fuck off me.

01:26.294 --> 01:27.670
You only get one, man.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.593
I gotta get out of here, man.

02:06.209 --> 02:07.502
Goddamn, man.

02:07.585 --> 02:08.545
Fuck.

02:10.046 --> 02:13.424
People gonna be blowing your phone up
all night, man. They gonna get worried.

02:21.182 --> 02:22.016
Hello.

02:22.684 --> 02:23.518
Hey, Mo.

02:25.603 --> 02:27.939
Yeah, yeah, yeah, one second.
One second. Kid?

02:29.357 --> 02:30.984
Are you kidding me, man?

02:33.027 --> 02:34.112
Gimme the phone.

02:36.322 --> 02:38.867
So we're going through Hersch
to get to me now?

02:38.950 --> 02:40.285
<i>Are you using again?</i>

02:40.368 --> 02:41.327
No.

02:42.412 --> 02:43.538
<i>Good.</i>

02:43.621 --> 02:44.998
<i>Is this about us?</i>

02:45.081 --> 02:49.085
No, it's not about y'all. I swear.

02:51.421 --> 02:54.132
<i>Do you need me and Christian</i>
<i>to get on a plane and come out there?</i>

02:54.215 --> 02:56.968
I don't need that.
I don't need that. I'm fine.

02:58.553 --> 03:01.598
<i>Look, whatever this is,</i>
<i>a girl, your brother, whatever.</i>

03:01.681 --> 03:04.225
<i>You can handle it.</i>
<i>What do you always tell me?</i>

03:04.851 --> 03:07.228
Don't weather the storm,
be that motherfucker.

03:07.312 --> 03:08.271
<i>Exactly.</i>

03:08.980 --> 03:11.149
<i>Remember that, and you'll be fine.</i>

03:12.859 --> 03:13.860
<i>We love you.</i>

03:15.028 --> 03:15.987
All right.

03:23.411 --> 03:25.872
We're divorced, and she still
gives me the best advice ever.

03:28.958 --> 03:29.876
Yo.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.630
I'm sorry for swinging on you, man.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.131
I get it.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.592
You thought you could test
a seventh-degree black belt.

03:40.470 --> 03:42.972
But you see
how much love I got for you, man?

03:44.265 --> 03:46.059
We'll be at the hotel in five.

03:48.102 --> 03:49.979
We're not going to the hotel, Hersch.

03:51.022 --> 03:52.273
Take me to Carlton's.

03:55.151 --> 03:56.152
All right, Kid.

04:05.578 --> 04:08.581
-What the fuck? That was fucking insane.
-Yeah.

04:08.665 --> 04:10.625
-What happened?
-I don't… I don't know.

04:12.210 --> 04:14.128
Why are all these
fucking people still here?

04:14.212 --> 04:17.423
Oh, see, um. Grilla has turned this
into a private spotlight for himself.

04:17.507 --> 04:18.841
It's going quite well actually.

04:18.925 --> 04:21.010
That's great. Fucking nightmare.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.513
-You wanna know something crazy?
-Yeah.

04:23.596 --> 04:25.473
I feel like watching Kid lose it on stage

04:25.556 --> 04:28.726
has made me realize that I am
totally overthinking Madison Square.

04:28.810 --> 04:31.104
I'm glad his meltdown
in front of 20,000 people

04:31.187 --> 04:32.855
-could be a life lesson for you.

04:32.939 --> 04:33.940
I'm not kidding.

04:34.023 --> 04:35.858
You're pissing me off,
this is a nightmare.

04:35.942 --> 04:39.445
Shut up. I'm not laughing at you.
I'm not laughing at Kid either.

04:39.529 --> 04:41.823
I'm just-- Look, he's a survivor. Right?

04:42.448 --> 04:45.702
He always bounces back, and
that's the type of strength that I need.

04:45.785 --> 04:48.371
As a comic? Shit, if I don't
have that, I'm not gonna be great.

04:48.454 --> 04:50.164
-I'm not gonna be anything.

04:50.248 --> 04:51.249
I should hang it up.

04:51.332 --> 04:52.792
Hey, hold on one second.

04:52.875 --> 04:54.794
That's really smart. A piece of advice?

04:54.877 --> 04:56.921
You have it,
do everything you need to become great,

04:57.005 --> 04:59.632
then don't let your personal life
do this fucking thing to you.

04:59.716 --> 05:01.592
-Like somebody we know.
-Yeah.

05:02.635 --> 05:03.511
Yeah?

05:04.053 --> 05:05.972
Yes, I fucking saw it! I'm at Wells Fargo.

05:11.436 --> 05:13.563
-Grilla!
-What's going on, though, man?

05:13.646 --> 05:15.106
-Hmm…
-Hey!

05:17.025 --> 05:18.568
-Hold on.
-Ugh. Really?

05:19.360 --> 05:21.612
I gotta take 'em out.
It's hard to talk in them shits.

05:21.696 --> 05:23.990
Look, real talk, between me and you.

05:24.073 --> 05:24.991
Mm-hmm.

05:25.074 --> 05:26.743
Any clue why Kid froze up out there,

05:26.826 --> 05:28.745
left a whole crowd
wondering why he lost his shit?

05:28.828 --> 05:30.538
Nah, I am as in the dark as you are.

05:30.621 --> 05:32.999
You need to be like me
and plan your next move.

05:33.624 --> 05:36.627
'Cause that right there
is the start of a long-ass disaster.

05:36.711 --> 05:37.545
Nah.

05:37.628 --> 05:41.132
They said that about Chappelle.
And he came back and got 60 mil, right?

05:41.215 --> 05:45.011
Nah. Chappelle, he kept that crazy shit
to himself, and he went to Africa.

05:45.678 --> 05:48.431
Fine. You wanna jump ship,
go ahead. But, first,

05:48.514 --> 05:52.894
um, do you still run all those open mics
in the towns we blow through?

05:52.977 --> 05:54.437
Hell yeah. I'm working on the name,

05:54.520 --> 05:56.522
but I'm doing one tomorrow,
it's gonna be called

05:56.606 --> 05:58.608
"Uncle Grilla's Ha Ha--", no, no.

05:58.691 --> 06:00.610
"Cookout with Uncle Grilla at Ha Ha's."

06:00.693 --> 06:03.863
-Tomorrow and you don't know the name?
-We just made it up right now.

06:03.946 --> 06:05.656
Look, I want a slot.

06:05.740 --> 06:06.991
You want a slot?

06:07.867 --> 06:09.619
Aw, shit, you making a comeback?

06:09.702 --> 06:12.080
No. No, I'm just, um…

06:12.163 --> 06:15.917
You know, I'm trying to see if I'm more
than someone who writes jokes for others.

06:16.626 --> 06:17.460
Well,

06:18.711 --> 06:20.421
we gonna find out tomorrow night!

06:20.505 --> 06:21.631
-Okay.

06:21.714 --> 06:24.258
I'm gonna give you a slot,
but if your ass is trash…

06:24.342 --> 06:25.968
-Thank you.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.637
-All right.

06:27.720 --> 06:30.014
We don't need to sing
about me being trash.

06:30.098 --> 06:33.643
I won't be trash. I'm very good.
I'm a good comedian. Thank you.

06:38.147 --> 06:39.440
<i>What's he doing?</i>

06:39.524 --> 06:41.776
<i>I don't know. Is this part of it?</i>

06:52.703 --> 06:54.455
Yo, C. Open up!

06:55.706 --> 06:56.707
C.

06:59.168 --> 07:00.002
Yo.

07:00.962 --> 07:03.506
What you mean, "Yo"? Why the fuck
ain't you answering the phone?

07:03.589 --> 07:06.092
'Cause all the calls
is about your crazy ass.

07:07.802 --> 07:08.970
What the fuck happened?

07:10.221 --> 07:11.639
Gene is what happened.

07:13.933 --> 07:16.436
He got videos of us dumping the body, man.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.856
What? The same dude
you was yelling at in the video?

07:19.939 --> 07:22.984
Gene, the fucking fan. He followed us, C.

07:23.067 --> 07:24.026
How, K?

07:24.110 --> 07:26.028
What does it matter how?

07:26.112 --> 07:28.072
What difference does it make "how"?

07:28.156 --> 07:29.699
You and your fucking fans.

07:30.366 --> 07:32.577
Did you hear what I just said to you?

07:32.660 --> 07:35.580
He's got videos of us dumping the body.

07:35.663 --> 07:37.999
It means we now have to do
whatever it is to get it back.

07:38.082 --> 07:41.127
-Whoa. We? What the fuck you mean "we"?
-Yes. We.

07:41.210 --> 07:44.964
Yo, I helped you dump two bodies.
This shit here is on you.

07:46.632 --> 07:49.218
Those are just as much
your bodies as they are mine.

07:49.760 --> 07:50.928
You understand that?

07:51.804 --> 07:53.347
Do you understand that?

07:53.431 --> 07:55.892
-Fuck off, man.
-What the fuck you mean, fuck off?

07:55.975 --> 07:57.560
-Fuck off!
-You fuck off!

07:58.394 --> 08:01.230
How about this? How about I go fuck off?
You want me to fuck off?

08:01.314 --> 08:03.524
I'll go fuck off
with all the shit that comes with it.

08:03.608 --> 08:05.401
That's right. All the money I give you.

08:05.485 --> 08:08.946
All the goddamn responsibilities
that I gotta take on that are yours.

08:09.030 --> 08:10.948
-That'll go fuck off with it.
-Better chill, K.

08:11.032 --> 08:13.326
Chill or what?
What happens if I don't chill?

08:13.409 --> 08:16.454
-What happens if I don't chill, C?
-You gonna get your ass beat.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.998
-I'm gonna get my ass beat.
-Mm-hmm.

08:19.081 --> 08:21.626
That's what's gonna happen to me?
I'm gonna get my ass beat.

08:21.709 --> 08:22.835
Hey, hey, hey. No, no, no.

08:22.919 --> 08:25.630
-Finish saying what you was saying.
-Don't touch me.

08:31.928 --> 08:33.471
Shit.

08:33.554 --> 08:35.264
I told you about that shit.

08:37.225 --> 08:39.894
Fuck off me, Carlton!
Get the fuck off me! Get the fuck off.

08:41.562 --> 08:42.438
Oh…

08:51.697 --> 08:52.615
What's up, Todd?

08:52.698 --> 08:55.284
<i>What's up? I'm at the hotel.</i>
<i>Where the fuck are you guys?</i>

08:56.118 --> 08:58.579
-We're working shit out.
<i>-Well, do I need to come there?</i>

08:58.663 --> 09:00.873
-No, no, no. He's fine.
<i>-Herschel, are you sure?</i>

09:00.957 --> 09:01.791
Yeah.

09:01.874 --> 09:04.377
<i>-Are you gonna bring him back?</i>
-I'ma call you later. All right.

09:04.460 --> 09:05.586
<i>Hersch--</i>

09:08.089 --> 09:08.923
Damn.

09:14.011 --> 09:17.014
That boy gotta learn how
to stick and move and slip that jab.

09:20.685 --> 09:22.144
When I get up, I'ma fuck you up.

09:24.188 --> 09:26.357
Stay down. Stop talking stupid.

09:31.404 --> 09:32.905
What we gonna do, man?

09:33.656 --> 09:34.657
Huh?

09:37.618 --> 09:40.037
Ain't a goddamn thing
we can do about it tonight.

09:40.621 --> 09:43.541
I'm going to bed.
You can take the couch or get out.

09:43.624 --> 09:46.002
C, you gotta listen to me, man.

09:46.085 --> 09:49.964
I can't have another man have
this type of control over my fucking life.

09:50.631 --> 09:51.757
Yeah.

09:59.265 --> 10:01.684
Should've called an ambulance
when Daphne OD'd.

10:03.894 --> 10:05.062
You should have.

11:44.453 --> 11:45.579
I got this.

11:46.163 --> 11:47.998
Don't worry about it. I got him.

11:48.082 --> 11:49.959
Yes, yes, I got his back.

11:51.544 --> 11:52.378
Mo.

11:53.754 --> 11:56.549
Yeah, don't worry, okay? All right.

11:56.632 --> 11:59.593
And tell Christian
his uncle called to say what's up.

11:59.677 --> 12:00.594
Bye-bye.

12:03.889 --> 12:07.768
I tried to calm her down, but she ain't
gonna be chill until she hear from you.

12:09.812 --> 12:11.272
Yeah, I figured as much.

12:16.402 --> 12:17.319
Scrapple?

12:18.028 --> 12:21.031
Scrapple and eggs.
You still eating like a slave, huh?

12:21.115 --> 12:23.993
Yeah, well, I figured the way
I tossed your ass around last night,

12:24.076 --> 12:26.287
-you need all the protein you can get.
-Mm.

12:28.706 --> 12:30.791
I've been thinking about the situation.

12:31.959 --> 12:34.003
About what to do with your fan.

12:34.879 --> 12:37.006
And as much as I hate to admit it,

12:37.089 --> 12:38.132
you're right.

12:41.177 --> 12:42.720
Fan gonna have to go, man.

12:46.098 --> 12:47.516
We're on the same page.

12:50.144 --> 12:52.021
I just don't know how to get to him.

12:53.439 --> 12:54.940
He's your big fan, right?

12:55.691 --> 12:58.027
Call him, he's gonna jump
at the opportunity to see you.

12:58.819 --> 13:00.196
He's on that 'gram shit?

13:01.030 --> 13:02.948
On that 'gram shit,
you tell him to meet you.

13:03.032 --> 13:04.450
Then when he show up…

13:05.951 --> 13:07.453
You just do what you gotta do.

13:07.536 --> 13:09.663
No, this is your stan, bro.

13:10.539 --> 13:12.500
-You gotta do it.
-Oh, come on, C.

13:13.250 --> 13:17.338
-I'll be right by your side.
-Come on, C. This is both of us, man.

13:18.881 --> 13:19.715
Look.

13:19.799 --> 13:23.427
This murder shit started with you.
It's gotta end with you, man.

13:37.858 --> 13:38.734
Okay.

13:42.655 --> 13:43.614
Okay.

13:48.994 --> 13:49.912
Shit.

13:51.622 --> 13:54.834
Todd's setting up a damn call
with the team for this afternoon.

13:56.502 --> 13:59.004
I gotta get back to the hotel.
If not, it'll look weird.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.423
Knowing Todd's ass, the way he'll panic,

14:01.507 --> 14:03.342
he'll have every
NA sponsor looking for me.

14:03.425 --> 14:06.262
You gotta give him a reason
why you staying longer in Philly.

14:06.929 --> 14:08.764
He already know you need money.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.141
I told him that,
I could ride off of that story.

14:11.809 --> 14:14.228
You know, I'm staying behind,
help you settle a debt.

14:14.311 --> 14:15.771
Yeah, okay. Okay.

14:16.397 --> 14:19.358
Good. I'm gonna go take a shower.
Meet you at the hotel.

14:29.827 --> 14:32.913
<i>My advice is that</i>
<i>we blame Kid's decision to leave the stage</i>

14:32.997 --> 14:34.832
<i>on something personal, something big.</i>

14:35.708 --> 14:38.460
<i>The divorce? His son maybe?</i>

14:38.544 --> 14:39.461
-No!
-No.

14:39.545 --> 14:41.255
You're not bringing Christian into this.

14:41.338 --> 14:43.424
-Why would you think that's a good idea?
-<i>Okay.</i>

14:43.507 --> 14:45.134
<i>God news is, the studio called</i>

14:45.217 --> 14:47.219
<i>to tell me they're still excited</i>
<i>to close this deal.</i>

14:47.303 --> 14:50.431
Okay. Thank you. You could have
led with that. That's great news.

14:50.514 --> 14:53.851
<i>They suggest we get Kid to New York.</i>
<i>Get him on a slew of morning shows.</i>

14:53.934 --> 14:56.395
<i>Tell everyone he's exhausted.</i>
<i>Hint at divorce stuff.</i>

14:56.478 --> 14:58.480
<i>Talk about </i>Anti-Verse<i>, then we're good.</i>

14:58.564 --> 14:59.690
Good idea.

15:00.524 --> 15:03.986
That's not gonna work. I need
a couple more days in Philly, I can't.

15:04.069 --> 15:06.447
<i>To do the right amount of PR,</i>
<i>I need you in New York.</i>

15:06.530 --> 15:08.407
Danica, I need you to listen to me.

15:08.490 --> 15:10.701
I said I can't do that,
I need more days in Philly.

15:10.784 --> 15:13.621
<i>We have a short window</i>
<i>to do this type of damage control.</i>

15:13.704 --> 15:16.081
-I can't.
-Danica, I gotta mute you. One sec.

15:19.877 --> 15:21.921
Carlton, wanna help me out?
What's going on here?

15:26.634 --> 15:27.760
Carlton's in trouble, Todd.

15:30.012 --> 15:32.014
He owes money and I'm helping him out.

15:32.097 --> 15:33.474
It's that simple, alright?

15:33.557 --> 15:34.475
Jesus.

15:35.267 --> 15:38.896
I'm not trying to explain this
to everybody, so it is what it is.

15:38.979 --> 15:39.855
Unmute the phone.

15:42.232 --> 15:43.317
Unmute the phone.

15:45.527 --> 15:46.779
-Terry.
-<i>Yeah?</i>

15:46.862 --> 15:48.614
Send $600,000 to Carlton.

15:48.697 --> 15:51.992
I'm not asking you to do this,
I'm telling you. Do you understand?

15:52.076 --> 15:53.035
<i>You got it, Kid.</i>

15:53.118 --> 15:56.413
All right, I'll circle back later.
Good call. Thank you.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.751
Carlton…

16:00.834 --> 16:03.379
…your personal,
private shit is a pain in his ass,

16:03.462 --> 16:04.755
and it's a pain in my ass.

16:04.838 --> 16:07.675
Yes, we know how you feel, Todd.

16:07.758 --> 16:10.094
You don't like audibles
because you wanna control everything.

16:10.177 --> 16:13.180
This is a situation that you can't.
It is what it is. Come on, C, let's go.

16:20.187 --> 16:21.021
Nice.

16:27.611 --> 16:31.407
-I had to lay it on thick back there.
-Yeah, whatever, Mr. <i>Anti-Verse.</i>

16:32.449 --> 16:35.828
You the man, you're sitting on the throne,
you can say whatever the fuck you want.

16:37.955 --> 16:39.665
Whatever that's supposed to mean.

16:40.624 --> 16:43.002
-Let me go holler at Billie for a moment.
-No, no, no.

16:43.085 --> 16:45.212
No. We gotta focus, man.

16:45.295 --> 16:46.839
Gotta find this Gene dude.

16:48.549 --> 16:50.175
You know they're fucking, right?

16:50.718 --> 16:52.219
-Herschel and Billie?
-Yeah.

16:52.761 --> 16:56.015
She wouldn't let him get that close
if he wasn't diggin' her down.

16:56.724 --> 16:58.809
You be saying shit just to say it.

17:00.686 --> 17:01.979
-What's up, guys?
-Hey, Kid.

17:02.062 --> 17:03.564
What's up, man? Can I get a photo?

17:03.647 --> 17:05.607
-Back the fuck up. Ain't got time.
-Hey, hey, hey.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.484
Hey! Chill.

17:08.068 --> 17:10.362
I'm sorry, man. Honestly, I apologize.

17:13.449 --> 17:14.283
Kid!

17:24.043 --> 17:24.877
Fuck!

17:29.631 --> 17:32.926
It's a chill spot.
Low-key, no traffic, no nosy folks.

17:37.139 --> 17:39.058
Make sure he hasn't shown it to anyone.

17:39.141 --> 17:41.268
You do him,
then let's get the fuck out of here.

17:46.982 --> 17:48.942
That's him right here. You stay here.

18:15.177 --> 18:17.346
Hey. What's up, Gene?

18:18.055 --> 18:21.308
-Kid. It's so good to see you.
-Yeah. Yeah.

18:22.059 --> 18:25.395
-Wait. What happened to your face?
-Oh. Boxing, man.

18:26.063 --> 18:28.190
I went a couple of rounds too long.

18:28.273 --> 18:32.402
What the heck are you talking about?
Do this, K. Do this shit, K.

18:32.986 --> 18:34.947
I really didn't think you'd show.

18:36.615 --> 18:37.866
What happened last night?

18:37.950 --> 18:40.452
Can't believe
you froze up like that at the show.

18:42.496 --> 18:43.956
You serious right now, Gene?

18:46.083 --> 18:47.251
Gene, you happened.

18:48.252 --> 18:50.045
What do you mean what happened? You!

18:50.712 --> 18:52.714
Dude, why did you
follow me the other night?

18:54.174 --> 18:56.051
I wanted to apologize for upsetting you.

18:58.971 --> 19:02.474
Did that person deserve it?
Were you protecting yourself?

19:02.558 --> 19:04.351
Okay, look, I don't--

19:04.434 --> 19:07.563
Yes. I was defending myself,
but I don't wanna talk about that.

19:08.772 --> 19:10.149
Gene. Where's the video?

19:10.649 --> 19:13.485
That's what I wanna talk about now.
Where's the video at?

19:16.613 --> 19:17.739
Who's that guy?

19:22.327 --> 19:23.662
That's my brother, Carlton.

19:27.457 --> 19:28.876
-Where you going?
-Oh, shit.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.088
Gene.

19:37.593 --> 19:38.594
Gene.

19:39.761 --> 19:40.596
Gene.

19:41.305 --> 19:42.764
Gene. Listen to me.

19:52.316 --> 19:53.150
That's you!

19:54.526 --> 19:55.986
Right here, that's you.

19:56.069 --> 19:59.448
-Did… You played cornerback, right?
-Nah, that's not me.

19:59.531 --> 20:01.575
You had a D1 scholarship to Temple!

20:03.452 --> 20:07.331
You set the high school record
for both passing and rushing touchdowns.

20:09.833 --> 20:11.877
I can't believe it's really you!

20:11.960 --> 20:13.420
You're the one who showed Kid

20:13.503 --> 20:15.839
the Robert Townsend special,
<i>Partners in Crime</i>!

20:16.465 --> 20:17.841
Do you remember showing him that?

20:17.925 --> 20:20.677
I mean, that's like
the most important day in his career!

20:20.761 --> 20:22.012
That's where it started!

20:22.554 --> 20:24.723
I mean, if you don't show him that…

20:27.935 --> 20:31.438
I mean, without you there is no him!

20:33.065 --> 20:35.817
Okay, Gene, Gene, listen to me.

20:35.901 --> 20:38.237
There is no me
if that video gets out, understand that?

20:39.154 --> 20:43.325
I know. That's why I came to the show.
To tell you you can trust me.

20:44.243 --> 20:47.162
That no one
will ever see that video. I… I swear.

20:47.246 --> 20:50.249
-You got that video on your phone?
-Yeah, I showed it to him last night.

20:51.667 --> 20:52.793
You make copies of that?

20:53.835 --> 20:54.795
Just the one.

20:58.590 --> 20:59.591
Gene, listen to me.

21:01.635 --> 21:03.595
I need you to delete that video.

21:04.513 --> 21:07.808
Okay, that's what I need
because that's what a friend would do.

21:08.475 --> 21:10.102
Right? A friend would delete it.

21:11.520 --> 21:12.854
Are we really friends?

21:14.690 --> 21:16.817
After the way
you yelled at me the other day--

21:16.900 --> 21:18.402
That was an accident.

21:18.485 --> 21:20.988
That's what that--
It was just an accident, Gene.

21:21.697 --> 21:25.867
I consider you a friend. I really…
I really consider you a friend.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.746
That means the world to me.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.375
Well, I mean it.

21:33.959 --> 21:36.169
Know what?
Let me show you how much I mean it.

21:36.253 --> 21:38.588
I'm about to go live right now.

21:38.672 --> 21:42.050
So you can see. I'm gonna go live.
Right now. Here we go.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.969
<i>You see this, here come the people.</i>

21:44.052 --> 21:47.055
<i>-Gene. Say what's up right now. We live.</i>
-<i> What's up?</i>

21:47.139 --> 21:49.224
-No, come on, Gene. Say what's up.
-What's up?

21:49.308 --> 21:51.518
-That's right.We're live.
What's up?

21:51.601 --> 21:55.230
I know what you guys are thinking.
"Hey, Kid, why were you so mean to Gene?"

21:55.314 --> 21:57.607
First thing I wanna say is this,
I was wrong.

21:57.691 --> 21:59.860
I was out of pocket.
'Cause you don't do that.

21:59.943 --> 22:02.612
You don't do that to friends, man.
You uplift friends.

22:02.696 --> 22:06.533
That's what I'm about to do to my guy,
because that's what he is. He's my friend.

22:06.616 --> 22:08.243
Gene, I want you to do this for me.

22:08.827 --> 22:11.496
-Oh, my goodness.
-Put your hand like this. Come on.

22:11.580 --> 22:14.041
You know what I'm about to do.
I don't do this unless it's real.

22:14.124 --> 22:16.626
<i>I mean this right now, Gene. Close it.</i>

22:16.710 --> 22:17.794
Huh?

22:17.878 --> 22:19.963
Huh? What did I just do?
I just put him in the circle!

22:20.547 --> 22:23.425
Get used to seeing him.
You're gonna see Gene at shows.

22:23.508 --> 22:26.428
He's gonna be backstage,
he's gonna be at premieres.

22:26.511 --> 22:28.472
As a matter of fact,
we're changing his name.

22:28.555 --> 22:30.599
He's now referred to as…

22:31.683 --> 22:34.603
-"Behind the Scenes Gene." You got that?

22:35.228 --> 22:37.481
Behind the Scenes Gene, my guy.

22:37.564 --> 22:39.983
Do me a favor,
welcome my guy to the circle.

22:40.067 --> 22:42.778
<i>Right now, y'all go to his page.</i>
<i>Gene, what's your page?</i>

22:43.362 --> 22:45.614
Oh, It's eugene.aubuchon.

22:45.697 --> 22:48.992
-People misspell it, but it's A-U-B--
-They got it.

22:49.076 --> 22:50.243
They got it, Gene!

22:50.327 --> 22:52.245
Go check your page, right now. Come on.

22:52.329 --> 22:54.623
-All right.
-Let's go, blow his damn phone up.

22:54.706 --> 22:56.917
Right now.
Tell me where you at. Talk to me.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.211
Oh, my goodness,
I just passed 200 followers.

22:59.294 --> 23:00.295
-Oh!

23:00.379 --> 23:03.507
-Keep it coming!
-It just went to 600 new followers!

23:03.590 --> 23:07.302
-It's over a thousand new followers!
-This is why I fuck with y'all.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.513
This is why I fuck with y'all.
'Cause you do what I ask.

23:09.596 --> 23:11.264
You respond. It's all love.

23:11.348 --> 23:14.768
Thank y'all. I appreciate y'all.
I'll holler at y'all later.

23:15.811 --> 23:18.438
-Huh? Where's it at?
-It just keeps going up.

23:18.522 --> 23:20.732
-It's gonna keep going up.
-It's 1.5… 1.6 thousand!

23:20.816 --> 23:23.110
We're not done.
Put your number in my phone.

23:24.653 --> 23:26.071
Come on. Gimme your number.

23:32.285 --> 23:33.954
Hey, Gene. Where you living?

23:34.663 --> 23:36.706
Uh, right now, I'm at the, uh…

23:38.542 --> 23:41.044
…the City Center Hotel,
down by the airport.

23:47.217 --> 23:50.137
I put it under, um,
"Behind the Scenes Gene."

23:50.220 --> 23:51.888
Behind the Scenes Gene.

23:51.972 --> 23:53.306
That's your new name.

23:53.390 --> 23:57.477
Know what? We gotta make this thing real.
We gotta go to lunch, dinner, something.

23:57.561 --> 23:58.895
Tomorrow? What you wanna do?

23:58.979 --> 24:01.731
-I would love that.
-Well, then it's done. Say no more.

24:02.941 --> 24:05.569
Huh? Come here.
Friends don't shake hands, friends hug.

24:05.652 --> 24:08.071
-Oh, man!
-That's what friends do, we hug.

24:08.155 --> 24:09.030
All right?

24:11.032 --> 24:11.950
This is…

24:14.828 --> 24:15.829
Thank you.

24:17.789 --> 24:21.334
Oh. Yeah, you were great. Thank you.

24:22.711 --> 24:23.712
Hey.

24:23.795 --> 24:25.297
You in the circle, Gene.

24:28.508 --> 24:29.551
This is real.

24:33.096 --> 24:35.432
-He's still got the video.
-I know what the fuck he's got, C.

24:35.515 --> 24:38.518
-He's probably got copies.
-You don't think I know what I'm doing?

24:38.602 --> 24:40.645
-Why didn't you shoot this--
-You don't have to.

24:40.729 --> 24:44.191
That guy's all about fucking friendship.
That guy idolizes his heroes.

24:44.274 --> 24:45.400
I'm a hero to him.

24:45.484 --> 24:47.527
I can convince him
to delete the fucking video.

24:48.111 --> 24:50.906
The last thing me and you need
is another body on our conscience.

24:52.073 --> 24:55.494
C, let…
Let me fucking handle it. I got it.

24:56.077 --> 24:57.078
All right?

24:57.954 --> 25:01.374
What we need to do is go now
and handle the money. Fuck Monday.

25:01.458 --> 25:03.585
Let's take the money
to the Greeks right now.

25:04.461 --> 25:05.795
Let's get this shit over with.

25:17.349 --> 25:20.268
I'm what I like to call
"religion-indifferent."

25:20.352 --> 25:25.106
Absolutely, if it makes you happy,
go for it. I'm just not super into it.

25:25.190 --> 25:27.275
But that's like with anything. Right?

25:27.359 --> 25:29.444
Like my friend,
she lost a bunch of weight,

25:29.528 --> 25:32.405
she feels amazing,
and any chance she gets,

25:32.489 --> 25:36.743
she would love to give you her testimony
about her Lord and Savior, the Keto Diet.

25:38.703 --> 25:40.288
I'm like,
"You're not fooling anybody."

25:40.372 --> 25:43.333
You know you're gonna
give up by Labor Day. You are.

25:43.416 --> 25:46.419
You can't change you. As hard
as you try or as much as you smoke.

25:47.879 --> 25:49.256
Yeah, Grilla, you get it.

25:49.339 --> 25:51.967
-He's a weed connoisseur back there.
-Hell yeah.

25:52.050 --> 25:55.262
He can smell the varying notes
of hoodrat shit in anything he gets.

25:57.806 --> 26:00.225
So, religion-indifferent,
that's what I say.

26:00.892 --> 26:04.437
<i>Because the problem</i>
<i>with religion and diets and weed</i>

26:04.521 --> 26:07.524
<i>is that they are all just ways</i>
<i>of trying to change who we are.</i>

26:07.607 --> 26:10.527
<i>To</i> <i>pretend that we are</i>
<i>something or someone else.</i>

26:11.444 --> 26:13.321
<i>And, to be honest, we can't.</i>

27:09.711 --> 27:11.212
-Six.
-Okay.

27:12.839 --> 27:13.965
It's all here.

27:14.049 --> 27:15.300
Damn right it is.

27:15.842 --> 27:17.719
Ah. Now that we've got that taken care of…

27:17.802 --> 27:19.512
We still haven't heard from Ari.

27:20.930 --> 27:22.098
Have you?

27:23.183 --> 27:24.100
No.

27:24.184 --> 27:25.852
You're quiet, Kid.

27:25.935 --> 27:27.729
Not like on TV or the movies.

27:28.605 --> 27:30.065
There you're very loud.

27:30.649 --> 27:32.776
I don't really know
what you want me to tell you.

27:34.903 --> 27:36.821
Hey, man,
I hope you guys find your brother.

27:37.322 --> 27:39.699
Did you ever meet him? Ari?

27:42.869 --> 27:44.412
-No.
-'Cause he wanted to meet you.

27:44.496 --> 27:46.665
-Didn't he love him?
-Yeah, he does.

27:48.458 --> 27:51.252
He asked Carlton to introduce him,
but Carlton said no.

27:51.336 --> 27:54.255
He said you're an asshole,
he wouldn't like you. Is that true, Kid?

27:54.339 --> 27:55.882
Are you an asshole?

27:56.675 --> 28:00.553
I mean, I do come from a family
of assholes, so, um, I don't know.

28:02.889 --> 28:05.308
In all seriousness,
I hope you guys find your brother.

28:05.392 --> 28:06.851
-So do we.
-Yeah.

28:28.039 --> 28:30.542
Looks like I wasn't
the only one laying it on thick.

28:32.043 --> 28:33.753
I told 'em you was an asshole

28:33.837 --> 28:36.047
so you'd never have
to deal with them motherfuckers again.

28:36.131 --> 28:38.800
Well, Ari's brothers
wasn't as tough as you made them seem.

28:38.883 --> 28:41.094
Sharks only feed when they're hungry.

28:41.177 --> 28:43.179
-Yeah, I bet they do.

28:48.685 --> 28:49.728
Yep.

28:49.811 --> 28:50.812
It's Julian.

28:50.895 --> 28:53.732
Hey, I know you said
you owed Ari some money.

28:53.815 --> 28:55.942
Looks like your problems
have just been solved.

28:56.025 --> 28:57.610
We just found his body.

29:01.406 --> 29:02.866
<i> Yo, C. You still there?</i>

29:04.784 --> 29:06.286
<i>Yo, did you hear what I said?</i>

29:07.746 --> 29:08.580
<i>C?</i>

29:09.372 --> 29:10.331
What's wrong?
