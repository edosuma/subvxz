00:07.700 --> 00:09.967
- *

00:10.067 --> 00:12.000
- So, since you've
been a bunny,

00:12.100 --> 00:13.967
is it weird going to the
bathroom in front of people?

00:14.067 --> 00:17.300
- I don't go in front
of people!

00:17.400 --> 00:18.833
Oh, wait...

00:18.933 --> 00:21.000
yes, I do.

00:21.933 --> 00:23.533
Later!

00:25.133 --> 00:26.500
- All right, here we go--

00:26.600 --> 00:28.433
two chocolate milks.

00:28.533 --> 00:30.600
- Oh, I thought you were
gonna make us milkshakes.

00:30.700 --> 00:31.867
- I'm not done yet.

00:35.167 --> 00:39.700
- I love having friends
with superpowers!

00:39.800 --> 00:42.033
- Yes, sir, we'll be there.

00:42.133 --> 00:44.067
No, four below-average
students in a nameless band

00:44.167 --> 00:47.067
would never let you down.

00:47.167 --> 00:49.233
I just booked a gig
for Friday night.

00:49.333 --> 00:52.633
And I think I'll celebrate
with a milkshake.

00:52.733 --> 00:55.033
- Hey!

00:55.133 --> 00:57.033
- Oh, that's okay.
He can keep it.

00:57.133 --> 00:59.100
- Whoa!

01:03.967 --> 01:05.267
- Joke's on you 'cause...

01:05.367 --> 01:07.600
I'm gonna drink my shirt.

01:09.400 --> 01:12.867
- You guys play the best
superhero games.

01:12.967 --> 01:16.433
- Yay!

01:16.533 --> 01:20.433
- Oh, I miss your cute little
bubble power, Chloe.

01:20.533 --> 01:22.633
- Oh, ever since teleporting
became her new power,

01:22.733 --> 01:24.300
it's all she does.

01:24.400 --> 01:26.900
It's killing my parents.
- BARB: Oh!

01:27.067 --> 01:29.200
Found her!

01:29.300 --> 01:31.100
Chloe.

01:31.200 --> 01:35.100
You have to stop teleporting
all over the house.

01:35.200 --> 01:36.400
- I know it's fun
for you, sweetie,

01:36.500 --> 01:38.867
but your Dad and I have trouble
keeping up with you.

01:38.967 --> 01:41.067
Well, I can, but he can't.

01:43.767 --> 01:46.367
- Daddy's slow.

01:46.467 --> 01:49.567
- You...you know what might
keep her from teleporting...

01:49.667 --> 01:51.267
- PHOEBE: Oh.

01:51.367 --> 01:53.733
- Airplane ride!
- All right.

01:53.833 --> 01:57.700
Once more around the world,
but that is it.

01:57.800 --> 01:58.967
Thunderman...

01:59.067 --> 02:01.233
feelin' his age!

02:01.333 --> 02:02.900
- CHLOE: Whoa!

02:04.700 --> 02:06.900
- Guess I have to go back
to my boring house--

02:07.067 --> 02:09.333
where nobody has powers.

02:09.433 --> 02:11.333
- Come on, your house
is fun, too.

02:11.433 --> 02:14.467
I mean, you've got--

02:14.567 --> 02:18.400
Hey, look, magic door!
Wooo!

02:18.500 --> 02:20.633
- So fun!

02:22.500 --> 02:23.933
- You know, sweetie,
if you keep on showing off

02:24.067 --> 02:25.300
your superpowers to Cherry,

02:25.400 --> 02:27.600
she might be tempted to
take advantage of you.

02:27.700 --> 02:29.800
- Come on, Mom.
Cherry's not like that.

02:29.900 --> 02:31.200
- Hi. Sorry, um...

02:31.300 --> 02:33.100
the sun made
my bike seat hot.

02:33.200 --> 02:36.600
Could you cool it off
with your cold spit?

02:36.700 --> 02:37.900
- It's freeze breath.

02:38.067 --> 02:40.167
- I have so much to learn!

02:40.267 --> 02:42.633
- Last one. I promise.

02:42.733 --> 02:44.467
- HANK: Barb!

02:45.867 --> 02:47.800
- I put her down to get us
some churros in Mexico

02:47.900 --> 02:49.167
and she teleported.

02:49.267 --> 02:50.733
What do we do?

02:50.833 --> 02:52.267
- CHLOE:

02:52.367 --> 02:54.333
' Cause Daddy's slow.

02:59.700 --> 03:01.933
- *

03:02.067 --> 03:03.133
* What you see

03:03.233 --> 03:04.600
* Is not what you get

03:04.700 --> 03:07.967
* Livin' our lives
with a secret *

03:08.067 --> 03:09.733
* We fit right in

03:09.833 --> 03:11.167
* Bet you never guessed

03:11.267 --> 03:12.533
* 'Cause we're
livin' our lives *

03:12.633 --> 03:14.267
* Just like all the rest

03:14.367 --> 03:16.067
* A picture
perfect family *

03:16.100 --> 03:18.167
* Is what we try to be

03:18.267 --> 03:19.333
* Look closer,
you might see *

03:19.433 --> 03:21.167
* The crazy things we do

03:21.267 --> 03:22.833
* This isn't
make believe *

03:22.933 --> 03:24.400
* It's our reality

03:24.500 --> 03:25.833
* Just your average family

03:25.933 --> 03:29.100
* Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble *

03:29.200 --> 03:32.767
* Livin' a double life

03:37.067 --> 03:39.367
- Phoebe! The best thing ever
happened to me this morning.

03:39.467 --> 03:40.700
- Your brother forgave you

03:40.800 --> 03:42.933
for accidentally
flushing his goldfish?

03:43.067 --> 03:44.433
- Shhhh!

03:44.533 --> 03:46.300
I don't talk about
your family secret.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.100
You shouldn't
talk about mine.

03:48.200 --> 03:49.667
- I'm sorry.

03:49.767 --> 03:52.067
I just can't stop thinking
about that poor fish.

03:52.100 --> 03:53.933
"Cherry! Why?"

03:59.133 --> 04:01.433
So, what happened
this morning?

04:01.533 --> 04:03.233
- Well, my mom made
me an appointment

04:03.333 --> 04:04.800
to take my driver's
test this Friday.

04:04.900 --> 04:06.633
Then I'll get to drive
my parents' car.

04:06.733 --> 04:09.333
OMG! Cherry, you're
gonna be driving!

04:09.433 --> 04:10.767
- OMG, Cherry.

04:10.867 --> 04:14.467
Drive far away and take
my sister with you!

04:14.567 --> 04:16.467
- Wait a minute--I thought your
parents weren't gonna

04:16.567 --> 04:18.167
let you take the driver's
test until you passed PE.

04:18.267 --> 04:20.400
- Yeah, but all I have to do
is hit the target in archery.

04:20.500 --> 04:22.200
- But you're horrible
at archery.

04:22.300 --> 04:23.633
They call you--

04:23.733 --> 04:26.133
The Girl Who's Horrible
At Archery.

04:26.233 --> 04:30.600
- But I have a super friend
who can help me with that.

04:30.700 --> 04:33.300
That's you, Phoebe,

04:33.400 --> 04:35.967
'cause you've got powers.

04:36.067 --> 04:40.967
- Right. You love my powers.

04:41.067 --> 04:44.833
- Hey, five seconds of dumber.

04:44.933 --> 04:46.433
Read the sign out front.

04:46.533 --> 04:49.833
"No skateboards, carts,
or snow sleds."

04:49.933 --> 04:53.100
That isn't toboggan.

04:53.200 --> 04:56.667
- You are why I voted against
the foreign exchange program.

04:59.167 --> 05:01.433
Thunderman.
- Bradford.

05:01.533 --> 05:03.300
Guys, I thought we were loading

05:03.400 --> 05:05.533
all of our equipment
in Wolfgang's car.

05:05.633 --> 05:07.067
- Yeah, about that.

05:07.133 --> 05:08.467
- His car's in Germany.

05:08.567 --> 05:10.900
- Vroom! Vroom!
Deutschland!

05:11.067 --> 05:14.133
- Guys, we needed that car to
get to our gig on Friday.

05:14.233 --> 05:16.167
- This band's a mess!

05:16.267 --> 05:17.833
We don't speak
the same language,

05:17.933 --> 05:19.067
we don't have a car,

05:19.167 --> 05:21.933
and we had to settle
for Gideon.

05:23.633 --> 05:25.433
- Guys, guys,
no one is more upset

05:25.533 --> 05:28.300
about Gideon than I am.

05:28.400 --> 05:30.500
I might know where
we can get a new car.

05:32.300 --> 05:34.133
- Oh, no, I've gotta
get across campus.

05:34.233 --> 05:35.767
Uh, do you think
that you could

05:35.867 --> 05:37.500
turn the clock back so
the bell doesn't ring yet?

05:37.600 --> 05:39.233
- Okay, look,
I'm starting to think

05:39.333 --> 05:41.067
we should be a little
bit more careful

05:41.100 --> 05:42.533
about how I use my powers.

05:42.633 --> 05:44.733
- Someone need
a clock turned back?

05:46.433 --> 05:48.467
- Thank you, Max.
You're the best.

05:48.567 --> 05:50.333
- Easy peasy.

05:50.433 --> 05:52.067
So, I hear you'll be getting
a car this Friday.

05:52.167 --> 05:55.667
Just to confirm--that car
is in this country, right?

06:00.800 --> 06:03.800
- Oh, Barb, Chloe
is wearing me out.

06:03.900 --> 06:06.333
- I know--between the
teleporting and the crying,

06:06.433 --> 06:08.200
I can't take it anymore.

06:08.300 --> 06:11.800
- I only cry because
I'm tired.

06:11.900 --> 06:13.767
- Morning.
- Good morning.

06:13.867 --> 06:15.633
- Morning.

06:21.967 --> 06:23.933
'Cause you just poured
us some marbles and--

06:24.067 --> 06:27.233
Dad is putting jelly
on an oven mitt.

06:27.333 --> 06:30.767
I'm sorry!

06:30.867 --> 06:33.233
- We're...we're fine.
We're just tired.

06:33.333 --> 06:34.433
Eat your pancakes.

06:34.533 --> 06:36.633
- I thought we only have
pancakes on Saturdays.

06:36.733 --> 06:40.400
- Which is why I made them.

06:40.500 --> 06:44.167
- They think it's Saturday,
but it's Thursday.

06:44.267 --> 06:45.667
- Get to the point.

06:45.767 --> 06:49.067
These marbles won't
stay fresh forever.

06:49.100 --> 06:52.667
- The point is we have
a free day off from school.

06:52.767 --> 06:54.100
- Sweet!

06:54.200 --> 06:55.600
We can do whatever we want.

06:55.700 --> 06:57.567
Race you to school!

06:57.667 --> 07:00.567
- No, we don't have
to go to school.

07:00.667 --> 07:02.367
It's like a snow day,
but with no snow

07:02.467 --> 07:04.767
and lots of pancakes.

07:04.867 --> 07:08.067
- I don't know.
This feels wrong.

07:08.100 --> 07:10.567
But this feels so right!

07:10.667 --> 07:13.067
I ate a hundred
pancakes this morning.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.433
- You only ate seven.

07:14.533 --> 07:17.333
- Sorry, Billy don't do math.

07:17.433 --> 07:20.133
- Mom, I'm home from--

07:20.233 --> 07:25.300
- Whatever Saturday afternoon
activity she was at!

07:26.767 --> 07:28.133
- Mom and Dad
think it's Saturday.

07:28.233 --> 07:29.733
So we stayed home
from school.

07:29.833 --> 07:32.067
- Ah, Chloe's giving
them "baby brain."

07:32.167 --> 07:34.067
The same thing happened
when Billy was born.

07:34.100 --> 07:35.667
I went to school anyway.

07:35.767 --> 07:38.533
What is wrong with me?

07:38.633 --> 07:43.067
- Heat breath! Heat breath!
Heat breath! Heat breath!

07:43.133 --> 07:44.667
- Hey! There you are.

07:44.767 --> 07:46.200
I thought we were gonna walk
home from school together.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.567
- We got to leave early--
they cancelled our history class

07:48.667 --> 07:52.400
after Max melted
the teacher's laptop.

07:53.900 --> 07:55.600
- Ah, you've done that
before, too?

07:55.700 --> 07:58.500
- Well, no, but it's
an old trick.

07:58.600 --> 08:00.700
- Then we went to the mall

08:00.800 --> 08:05.067
and Max used his telekinesis
to pant mall cops.

08:05.167 --> 08:07.933
- Boop!

08:08.067 --> 08:10.500
And then we came up with
a secret handshake.

08:10.600 --> 08:13.267
That's our thing.

08:13.367 --> 08:14.767
- Let's clap it out,
Cher-Cher.

08:14.867 --> 08:18.367
That's my nickname for her.

08:18.467 --> 08:19.800
- CHERRY & MAX:
One, two, three, four...

08:19.900 --> 08:21.467
- ...five, six,
seven, eight!

08:21.567 --> 08:24.233
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

08:24.333 --> 08:26.300
Secret handshake.

08:26.400 --> 08:28.067
- All right, then...

08:28.167 --> 08:29.733
Look, Cherry, I was thinking
we should practice archery

08:29.833 --> 08:33.233
so you can pass PE tomorrow and
get that driver's license.

08:33.333 --> 08:35.833
- Actually, Max is gonna
hide in the bushes during class

08:35.933 --> 08:39.233
and use his telekinesis
to help me hit the target.

08:39.333 --> 08:41.067
- CHERRY & MAX:
Superpowers!

08:41.133 --> 08:43.700
- Pow!

08:43.800 --> 08:45.567
- That's my mom.

08:45.667 --> 08:47.433
- Here, let me get
the door for ya.

08:47.533 --> 08:49.633
- Here, I'll get it.

08:52.833 --> 08:56.567
- A minivan! Score!

09:02.067 --> 09:04.467
- Day two of our
bonus weekend.

09:04.567 --> 09:06.633
- Yeah, nothing says
Sunday morning

09:06.733 --> 09:08.433
like French toast and...

09:10.600 --> 09:13.867
- More marbles.

09:13.967 --> 09:17.667
- Wait a minute.
Something's not right.

09:17.767 --> 09:21.500
- Yeah, you guys look like you
got dressed in the dark.

09:21.600 --> 09:24.167
- He's just joking.

09:24.267 --> 09:25.700
Everything's right.

09:25.800 --> 09:27.833
Breakfast is right.
You guys look right.

09:27.933 --> 09:29.600
The most right Sunday ever.

09:29.700 --> 09:32.300
Am I right?

09:32.400 --> 09:34.667
- No, no, something
is wrong.

09:34.767 --> 09:36.400
Ah, I know.

09:36.500 --> 09:38.300
The gardener's not here.

09:38.400 --> 09:40.433
He always comes on Sunday.

09:40.533 --> 09:42.167
I'd better call him.
- No, no!

09:42.267 --> 09:43.800
You already called him.

09:43.900 --> 09:45.633
He said he was
gonna be late.

09:47.767 --> 09:50.467
I just don't know!

09:50.567 --> 09:52.867
- BARB: It's okay.

09:55.367 --> 09:57.700
- It's not really Sunday.
The gardener's not coming.

09:57.800 --> 09:59.333
We're gonna get caught.

09:59.433 --> 10:00.567
- No, we're not.

10:00.667 --> 10:02.933
We're gonna mow,
blow, and go.

10:03.033 --> 10:05.233
- Who are they and how
are they gonna help us?

10:09.300 --> 10:10.867
- Uh, hey, Oscar.

10:10.967 --> 10:14.033
I almost thought you
forgot about today.

10:17.233 --> 10:20.233
- We're totally pulling
it off, Billy.

10:20.333 --> 10:22.067
- There is no Billy.

10:22.167 --> 10:24.033
Only Oscar.

10:32.233 --> 10:35.367
That is a man who cares.

10:35.467 --> 10:42.033
- *

10:47.667 --> 10:51.000
- Okay, that's an "F".

10:51.100 --> 10:53.200
Who's next?
- Oh, I am, Coach.

10:53.300 --> 10:55.633
- Oh, great.

10:55.733 --> 10:57.833
Cherry!

11:00.700 --> 11:02.800
Remember, the target's
that-a-way.

11:07.933 --> 11:10.400
- Step aside, Max.
I'm gonna help Cherry pass.

11:10.500 --> 11:11.833
- Beat it.
I'm helpin' her pass.

11:11.933 --> 11:13.133
- Would you stop trying
to steal my friend.

11:13.233 --> 11:16.600
- You can have her back after
I use her for her car.

11:16.700 --> 11:18.800
Oh, look, a puppy!

11:21.967 --> 11:23.867
- STUDENTS:

11:23.967 --> 11:25.833
- Good enough for a "C".

11:25.933 --> 11:28.167
You passed.
- Yay!

11:28.267 --> 11:30.267
Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you!

11:30.367 --> 11:33.233
- That's all your got your
new best friend

11:33.333 --> 11:37.800
Watch her real best friend
get her an "A".

11:37.900 --> 11:40.333
- Oh, my!

11:40.433 --> 11:41.600
- I'm not sure.

11:41.700 --> 11:43.067
I guess a "C" isn't
good enough,

11:43.167 --> 11:47.733
even though I'm super
happy with a "C"!

11:47.833 --> 11:49.533
- Let her go.

11:49.633 --> 11:52.700
- MAX & PHOEBE:

12:00.667 --> 12:02.700
- MAX & PHOEBE:
Look what you did!

12:02.800 --> 12:05.533
- You! Detention!

12:05.633 --> 12:07.433
- But I have my driver's
test today.

12:07.533 --> 12:10.800
- And I used to have a foot
that wasn't a shish kabob.

12:15.367 --> 12:17.300
- Hey, Cherry.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.267
Sorry about that.

12:20.933 --> 12:21.967
What were you thinking?

12:22.067 --> 12:23.133
- I was just trying to help.

12:23.233 --> 12:25.300
- And how did that
turn out?

12:29.900 --> 12:31.367
- By the way...

12:31.467 --> 12:33.800
there was no puppy.

12:39.900 --> 12:44.667
- *

12:44.767 --> 12:47.500
- Shoulda just left when
I told you to, but...

12:47.600 --> 12:50.067
No, I'm Phoebe.

12:50.100 --> 12:52.667
My friends all get "A"s, too.

12:52.767 --> 12:54.900
I'm Max
and I hit myself with books.

12:56.933 --> 12:58.133
- Ow!

12:58.233 --> 12:59.833
- Thanks to us my friend
is in detention

13:00.067 --> 13:01.567
and can't take
her driver's test.

13:01.667 --> 13:02.967
It's gonna take her
months to reschedule.

13:03.067 --> 13:05.600
Oh, good thing
I've got my best guys

13:05.700 --> 13:08.267
workin' on Plan B to get
us to the gig tonight.

13:08.367 --> 13:10.600
- Okay, Max, Wolfgang's got
a hundred more of these outside.

13:10.700 --> 13:12.667
- We're gonna tie 'em
to our band equipment

13:12.767 --> 13:14.767
and float everything
to our gig.

13:17.633 --> 13:20.067
- Lookout!

13:22.600 --> 13:24.200
- Well, go get him.

13:24.300 --> 13:26.400
We can't be looking for
a car and a new drummer.

13:26.500 --> 13:28.200
Go!

13:30.567 --> 13:32.500
- I can get Cherry
out of detention.

13:32.600 --> 13:34.900
It's not like
she's in jail.

13:37.600 --> 13:39.833
What kind of school
is this?

13:39.933 --> 13:42.067
Principal Bradford,
this isn't fair.

13:42.167 --> 13:45.567
- Oh! Don't you ever
go home?

13:45.667 --> 13:47.700
- Don't worry, Cherry,
I'm gonna help you.

13:47.800 --> 13:49.167
- Please don't, Phoebe.

13:49.267 --> 13:51.167
You're just gonna get
me into more trouble.

13:51.267 --> 13:53.067
- All right! Two more
days of detention

13:53.133 --> 13:54.967
for talkin' to a Thunderman!

13:55.067 --> 13:57.833
- Three days!

13:57.933 --> 13:59.667
- I will get you to
that driver's test.

13:59.767 --> 14:02.333
- Stop talking to me!
- PRINCIPAL: Four days!

14:07.233 --> 14:09.900
Oh, Oscar, uh,
before you leave,

14:10.067 --> 14:13.533
could you take down
that hornets' nest?

14:13.633 --> 14:15.500
- Daddy, chase me!

14:15.600 --> 14:17.933
- Yay, more running.

14:18.067 --> 14:19.967
- BILLY: Can't you go
any faster?

14:20.067 --> 14:21.733
- NORA: I wear the pants.

14:21.833 --> 14:23.633
I will walk as fast
as I want.

14:30.667 --> 14:32.400
- Maybe it's all
this fresh air,

14:32.500 --> 14:33.767
but I just realized--

14:33.867 --> 14:35.800
if today's fake Sunday,

14:35.900 --> 14:37.933
then tomorrow's fake Monday--

14:38.067 --> 14:41.633
which means we have to go to
fake school on real Saturday.

14:41.733 --> 14:43.300
- You're right.

14:43.400 --> 14:45.967
How is skipping school
making you smarter?

14:46.067 --> 14:47.933
- I wish we could
go back in time

14:48.067 --> 14:49.933
and tell them the truth
about what day it was.

14:50.067 --> 14:53.600
- Wait, maybe there is
a way to go back in time.

14:53.700 --> 14:56.533
- Good, because I just
knocked down this hornets' nest

14:56.633 --> 14:59.167
and they sound really mad.

15:11.100 --> 15:15.433
- Hank, I think the gardener
just split in half.

15:15.533 --> 15:17.067
- Huh.

15:23.533 --> 15:29.400
- *

15:39.467 --> 15:42.767
- Sorry. Painful hangnail.

15:42.867 --> 15:44.333
- Awww...

15:44.433 --> 15:46.467
I have a hole in my toe!

15:49.067 --> 15:50.500
- Hey, I'm gonna
get you outta here

15:50.600 --> 15:51.833
in time for your
driver's test.

15:55.167 --> 15:57.400
Your superhero
bestie's got this.

15:57.500 --> 16:00.567
I'll use my powers to spill
that water on Bradford,

16:00.667 --> 16:02.833
and when he goes to dry off,
we'll duck out.

16:02.933 --> 16:04.633
- But that's not water,
that's--

16:05.967 --> 16:07.600
- Hot tea!

16:07.700 --> 16:09.833
- My toe! My toe!

16:09.933 --> 16:13.600
It hurts worse than
opening my paycheck.

16:16.233 --> 16:17.433
Phoebe?

16:17.533 --> 16:19.700
What are you doing here?

16:19.800 --> 16:21.767
- I came to check
out your toe

16:21.867 --> 16:24.933
and clean the floor
with my belly!

16:25.067 --> 16:27.967
Done and done!

16:29.967 --> 16:32.100
- Let me know
when you're done

16:32.200 --> 16:34.833
cleaning that chair
with your butt.

16:34.933 --> 16:36.700
- Why do I have to
be in detention?

16:36.800 --> 16:39.167
- Because you never go home.

16:39.267 --> 16:40.767
Two days!

16:40.867 --> 16:42.700
- But now I'm just gonna
be here even more.

16:42.800 --> 16:45.567
- One day!

16:45.667 --> 16:49.233
- *

16:49.333 --> 16:51.867
- Oh, Chloe's
finally napping.

16:51.967 --> 16:53.967
Now maybe we can
get some rest.

16:54.067 --> 16:55.800
- HANK:

16:55.900 --> 16:58.833
- Wait for me.

16:58.933 --> 17:01.533
- Aw, they're sleeping.

17:01.633 --> 17:04.533
Time to wake them up
with a trip to the past.

17:04.633 --> 17:06.200
- Hit it, Colosso.

17:06.300 --> 17:08.700
- Don't tell me how
to do my job.

17:14.267 --> 17:16.133
Hold me!

17:16.233 --> 17:20.067
- My work here is done.

17:20.133 --> 17:22.600
- Holy cow, did you
guys feel that?

17:22.700 --> 17:25.500
- Max's time machine
blew up.

17:25.600 --> 17:28.867
- Yes, Max's time machine.

17:28.967 --> 17:31.100
It blew up.

17:31.200 --> 17:34.800
- I think it took us
two days back in time.

17:34.900 --> 17:37.533
That means it's Friday again.

17:39.067 --> 17:42.267
- Hm, how can we see if we
really went back in time?

17:44.867 --> 17:48.733
- We could do that or...

17:48.833 --> 17:50.633
we could just turn
on the TV.

17:50.733 --> 17:53.467
- MALE NEWSCASTER: Welcome
to Friday's edition

17:53.567 --> 17:57.067
of Eyewitness News.

17:57.167 --> 18:00.100
- Wow, how about
that Max, huh?

18:00.200 --> 18:03.567
He sure does
believable things.

18:03.667 --> 18:07.433
- Yes, believable things.

18:07.533 --> 18:09.500
- Anyway, we'll be outside.
Happy Friday.

18:09.600 --> 18:13.700
Come on, Billy.
- But the dinosaurs!

18:13.800 --> 18:15.800
- Are we gonna ground them

18:15.900 --> 18:17.867
for pretending it
was the weekend?

18:17.967 --> 18:20.800
- Ah, as long as their little
stunt didn't wake up Chloe.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.533
- CHLOE: Mommy!

18:22.633 --> 18:24.567
- Now they're grounded.

18:27.933 --> 18:29.900
- I haven't been in
detention before.

18:30.067 --> 18:32.200
- Me, neither!

18:32.300 --> 18:35.267
- Stop the chit-chat!

18:35.367 --> 18:37.867
You are worse
than your brother.

18:37.967 --> 18:40.100
Man, I cannot
stand that kid.

18:42.933 --> 18:45.233
Why?

18:45.333 --> 18:47.100
- Missed you, too, Bradford.

18:47.200 --> 18:49.067
Wanna know what I did?
- Don't care.

18:49.100 --> 18:51.067
Grab some orange.

18:56.933 --> 18:58.333
- So, Cherry, this
is how we're gonna

18:58.433 --> 19:00.633
get you outta detention in
time for your driver's test.

19:00.733 --> 19:02.100
- I don't want your help.

19:02.200 --> 19:04.467
- So, this is what
we're gonna do.

19:04.567 --> 19:06.067
See that tarantula
over there?

19:06.167 --> 19:07.300
Imagine the panic
in this room

19:07.400 --> 19:08.733
when I pop the lid
off that thing.

19:08.833 --> 19:10.233
- PRINCIPAL: Hey!

19:10.333 --> 19:13.767
- Shoot, forgot about
the no chit-chat rule.

19:13.867 --> 19:15.900
- Get over here, Thunderman.

19:16.067 --> 19:17.267
You are sitting
where I can see you

19:17.367 --> 19:19.500
until detention's over.

19:23.733 --> 19:25.867
- So, did your parents
ever buy the lake house?

19:25.967 --> 19:27.633
- Yeah, the, uh, seller

19:27.733 --> 19:29.833
finally agreed to pay
for the new fence.

19:29.933 --> 19:31.800
Now shut your mouthhole!

19:33.500 --> 19:35.600
- Listen, Cherry, I'm really
sorry about all this.

19:35.700 --> 19:37.800
I just...I thought I was
losing you to Max

19:37.900 --> 19:39.767
'cause I wasn't
using my powers.

19:39.867 --> 19:41.300
- Phoebe, we were friends

19:41.400 --> 19:43.133
before I knew
you had superpowers.

19:43.233 --> 19:46.500
That'll never change.
- Thanks.

19:46.600 --> 19:49.067
- Besides, I shouldn't have kept
asking you to use your powers.

19:49.100 --> 19:51.233
I'll never get
good at anything,

19:51.333 --> 19:53.633
if I let the Thunder Twins
do everything for me.

19:53.733 --> 19:57.600
- Yeah, we don't really go by
"The Thunder Twins."

19:57.700 --> 20:00.733
- Well, you should.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.833
Oh, I have an idea.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.300
- Cherry, what are
you doing?

20:07.400 --> 20:09.567
- I am going to fix
this mess myself.

20:09.667 --> 20:13.000
If I can free that tarantula,
we can get outta here.

20:13.100 --> 20:15.467
You and me--
not the tarantula.

20:15.567 --> 20:17.433
- How are you gonna
free that thing from here?

20:17.533 --> 20:20.500
- With my mini bow & arrow.

20:20.600 --> 20:24.033
- Because you're so good
with a big bow & arrow?

20:24.133 --> 20:26.933
Cherry, why don't I just
use my telekinesis?

20:27.033 --> 20:28.233
You know what they call me--

20:28.333 --> 20:31.000
Girl Who's Really Great
At Telekinesis.

20:31.100 --> 20:32.800
- No more superpowers.

20:32.900 --> 20:35.400
I have to do this
on my own.

20:47.533 --> 20:50.233
- That toe is like a magnet.

20:50.333 --> 20:53.467
- Oh, no!

20:59.467 --> 21:01.300
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

21:01.400 --> 21:03.233
All right, all right,
I'll make a deal with you.

21:03.333 --> 21:05.100
No pictures equals
no detention.

21:05.200 --> 21:06.967
- See ya.
- Fine.

21:07.067 --> 21:09.433
- Wait! Wait! Wait!

21:09.533 --> 21:11.833
Somebody help me outta this!

21:11.933 --> 21:14.233
Little delinquents!

21:19.200 --> 21:21.767
Go ahead, bite me.

21:21.867 --> 21:23.933
I dare you!

21:31.233 --> 21:33.067
- Look, she's pulling out
of the parking space.

21:33.167 --> 21:34.300
You go, Cherry!

21:34.400 --> 21:35.767
- Come on, Cherry,
you're gonna nail this!

21:39.467 --> 21:43.267
- Technically,
she did nail it.

21:43.367 --> 21:46.400
- We can still make
the gig if we run.

21:53.500 --> 21:56.567
- Okay, that curb
came out of nowhere.

21:56.667 --> 22:00.333
- To be fair--curbs don't really
come out of nowhere.

22:04.533 --> 22:07.233
Not now!

22:10.600 --> 22:25.767
- *
