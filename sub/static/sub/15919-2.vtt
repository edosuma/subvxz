WEBVTT

00:00.026 --> 00:01.812
Previously on being Mary Jane...

00:01.859 --> 00:05.101
I am tired of all you grown-ass people

00:05.117 --> 00:06.765
laying around this house

00:06.766 --> 00:08.408
waiting for me to pay the heat.

00:08.409 --> 00:10.653
What does that plan look like, niecy?

00:10.654 --> 00:12.325
_

00:12.326 --> 00:14.533
You guys are gonna stay in here, okay?

00:14.534 --> 00:16.741
Don't beat yourself up.

00:16.743 --> 00:18.865
You are allowed to take twice as long

00:18.867 --> 00:22.282
untangling your heart from
him as you spent loving him.

00:23.992 --> 00:26.242
This morning when I woke
up, I had peed in the bed.

00:26.246 --> 00:28.700
Mary Jane, you know what?
You're stressed.

00:32.493 --> 00:34.533
Are you with
her because you love her,

00:34.534 --> 00:37.659
or are you with her because
she's having your baby?

01:37.075 --> 01:39.867
Ahh!
- Hey.

01:39.868 --> 01:42.865
Good morning.

01:42.867 --> 01:45.032
I thought I took my key back.

01:45.034 --> 01:47.658
Yeah, you did, but it's just breakfast.

01:47.659 --> 01:49.020
Here.

01:50.012 --> 01:51.262
You try.

01:53.326 --> 01:56.533
What do you think?
- I think I just gained five pounds.

01:56.534 --> 01:59.744
Yeah, well, as long as you gain them
in the places I like, it's all good.

01:59.784 --> 02:03.117
Oh, you got something.
- David.

02:04.534 --> 02:06.075
You're right. Habit.

02:06.079 --> 02:07.865
I'm sorry.

02:07.867 --> 02:09.533
You know what? I'm sorry.

02:11.950 --> 02:13.856
For everything,

02:14.201 --> 02:16.629
giving up on you and our baby and...

02:17.621 --> 02:20.441
stealing your sperm and
two or three other things

02:20.472 --> 02:22.093
you don't even know about.

02:23.117 --> 02:25.977
Well, I'm no Saint, so...
- Yeah, you think?

02:28.117 --> 02:30.127
Would you mind if I kissed you?

02:32.950 --> 02:34.034
Are you sure?

02:36.117 --> 02:37.493
You tell me.

02:50.535 --> 02:51.942
Who's that?

02:52.325 --> 02:55.200
Come on, Mary Jane, don't act
like you don't know about Andre.

02:58.242 --> 02:59.741
Ahh!

03:31.401 --> 03:32.955
Ooh, yummy.

03:32.963 --> 03:34.760
Hey, so, you don't hear
Isabelle in there screaming?

03:34.783 --> 03:37.359
Oh, she's fine; I just looked
in on her a few minutes ago.

03:37.362 --> 03:39.941
She has to cry through it.
That'll teach her independence.

03:39.943 --> 03:41.568
And who's teaching you independence?

03:42.567 --> 03:44.107
Breakfast is almost ready.

03:44.109 --> 03:46.401
Banana pancakes, mmm.

03:50.150 --> 03:51.768
My le creuset.

03:52.359 --> 03:53.885
Your what?

03:53.994 --> 03:56.608
My French oven, you let it burn.

03:56.609 --> 03:58.192
Not really.

03:58.196 --> 04:01.399
I scraped most of it off, and
right now, I'm letting it soak.

04:01.453 --> 04:04.992
Oh, God. Oh.

04:05.505 --> 04:07.401
Auntie, it's fine.

04:07.404 --> 04:09.359
You should have saw it
a half an hour ago.

04:09.362 --> 04:11.011
It'll come off.

04:11.581 --> 04:13.067
I need a minute.

You spent 300 dollars on a pot?

06:12.153 --> 06:14.524
Well, it's not just a pot, Patrick.

06:14.526 --> 06:17.309
It's a signature brand
porcelain-enameled French oven,

06:17.317 --> 06:19.762
so... you understand. Look, never mind.

06:19.817 --> 06:22.849
Bottom line, I don't
like people in my house.

06:22.900 --> 06:26.107
That guest room, it's
like a show room to me.

06:26.109 --> 06:27.899
It looks best untouched.

06:27.900 --> 06:31.566
Sometimes I go in there,
and I just stare at it.

06:31.568 --> 06:33.152
It looks like it belongs in a magazine,

06:33.154 --> 06:35.274
and I'd like it to stay that way.

06:35.276 --> 06:36.650
What?

06:36.651 --> 06:39.191
Hey, hey, no, hey, it's your house,
and that's the way you want it.

06:39.192 --> 06:42.568
Good, I'm glad we're on the same page,
and you understand the need for urgency.

06:42.571 --> 06:44.568
I'm making some progress with mom.

06:44.571 --> 06:46.774
As a matter of fact, I plan
on talking to her later

06:46.805 --> 06:49.149
to see what I can do about
getting niecy back over there.

06:49.164 --> 06:51.651
Well, you know it's not just about that.
- I know, I know, I'm working on some things

06:51.655 --> 06:54.736
to get niecy and the kids with me.
- How?

06:55.359 --> 06:57.304
Honey, you live in a dark, dank closet.

06:57.329 --> 07:00.699
See, why do you always feel the need
to highlight, underscore, bold, and...

07:00.701 --> 07:03.115
Oh, snap. Excuse me.

07:03.117 --> 07:05.366
Boy, what did you do?
- Oh, no. Okay.

07:05.367 --> 07:08.157
Niecy. Niecy. Oh, my God.
- Trevion, what are you doing?

07:08.159 --> 07:11.409
Patrick: - Niecy, I told you to watch him. Niecy:
- No, trevion, no, no.

07:11.412 --> 07:12.583
What's wrong with you?

07:12.599 --> 07:14.284
Don't you got some coloring
books or something?

07:14.287 --> 07:15.662
I don't get it.

07:15.677 --> 07:19.324
Right now, in this moment, she's free.

07:19.325 --> 07:21.866
Why doesn't she just run?
- And go where?

07:21.868 --> 07:23.534
Anywhere but back to that motel.

07:23.537 --> 07:27.767
Well, what people don't realize, it's not
her body that's enslaved; it's her mind.

07:28.784 --> 07:31.000
She looks
like one of those dogs,

07:31.001 --> 07:34.367
you know, that's, like, chained in the
yard, except her leash isn't there.

07:34.371 --> 07:36.991
Yeah, yeah, she
tells herself she loves him,

07:36.993 --> 07:38.950
she'll do anything for him.

07:38.951 --> 07:41.357
"I know I called, mister officer,

07:41.380 --> 07:43.794
but he did not hit me."

07:44.242 --> 07:47.658
"But you're bleeding
profusely from your mouth,

07:47.659 --> 07:50.241
and your nose, ma'am, I mean"...

07:50.242 --> 07:53.908
"I fell, mister officer."

07:53.909 --> 07:57.658
That, and worse, every day.

07:57.659 --> 07:59.741
And those are the, uh,

07:59.743 --> 08:03.117
those are the pg stories,
once they're sold.

08:05.200 --> 08:08.908
Now, see, this one looks like
she's been sold a time or two.

08:08.909 --> 08:10.617
How can you tell?

08:10.621 --> 08:14.449
She jumps every time
somebody walks by and drives up.

08:14.451 --> 08:17.866
The new ones usually stay up
underneath their boyfriends.

08:17.868 --> 08:19.098
See, when we do our raids,

08:19.099 --> 08:21.973
the ones we can usually save are the ones

08:21.974 --> 08:23.616
who just got in the game.

08:23.617 --> 08:25.035
The ones that have been bought

08:25.036 --> 08:26.449
and sold and bought and sold,

08:26.451 --> 08:28.659
they're the ones keep slipping
through your fingers.

08:28.663 --> 08:30.118
According to my research,

08:30.119 --> 08:31.574
the buying and selling of girls

08:31.576 --> 08:33.472
is usually based on some sort

08:33.474 --> 08:36.407
of debt that needs to be repaid.
- Yeah.

08:36.409 --> 08:38.991
From one pimp to another.

08:38.993 --> 08:40.797
That, but some guys don't pimp.

08:40.813 --> 08:42.159
Some guys are just trying
to make some money,

08:42.162 --> 08:43.784
so they snatch them on the way to school.

08:43.788 --> 08:45.835
What?
- Yeah, store, church.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.234
Just snatch them and sell
them to traffickers.

08:49.759 --> 08:52.800
What is this, the
sequel to 12 years a slave?

08:52.801 --> 08:54.092
Basically.

08:57.759 --> 09:00.965
Looks like she has to get to work.

09:00.967 --> 09:02.384
You know, I don't get it.

09:02.387 --> 09:04.965
In this day and age, these
girls could call home,

09:04.967 --> 09:06.843
they could send a text, they could email.

09:06.846 --> 09:09.426
Not if they tell you
they're gonna kill you.

09:41.734 --> 09:43.734
I have a herd of girls I
don't know what to do with.

09:43.737 --> 09:45.210
All right, I'm coming.

09:48.359 --> 09:51.193
Mary Jane?
- Okay, okay.

10:02.901 --> 10:05.607
Okay, before you guys say
anything, I know, I know,

10:05.609 --> 10:08.108
it looks a lot smaller
than it does on TV.

10:08.109 --> 10:09.692
Well, that's because we shoot everything

10:09.696 --> 10:12.233
with wide-angle lenses
to give it that effect.

10:12.234 --> 10:17.024
So who wants to sit in the anchor chair?

10:17.026 --> 10:18.525
Me.
- I would.

10:18.529 --> 10:20.984
Anel, your hand went up first. Follow me.

10:22.901 --> 10:24.745
Watch your step.

10:26.609 --> 10:28.774
It's nothing back here. It's just plain.

10:28.775 --> 10:31.401
I know; Sometimes I even have
my shoes off under there.

10:34.443 --> 10:37.565
Hello, America. I'm Mary Jane Paul.

10:37.567 --> 10:39.524
Oh, this is a cool surprise.

10:39.525 --> 10:41.691
Ladies, I would like to introduce you

10:41.692 --> 10:43.774
to miss Kara lynch.

10:43.775 --> 10:45.276
Kara is our executive producer

10:45.277 --> 10:46.774
here at talk back.

10:46.775 --> 10:49.774
Kara is like a movie director.

10:49.775 --> 10:51.774
Yeah.

10:51.775 --> 10:53.859
She and I set the creative tone
and direction for the show,

10:53.862 --> 10:55.859
and she makes sure
everything is executed.

10:55.862 --> 10:58.191
Yes. Hello, everybody.

10:58.193 --> 10:59.443
You ladies look so professional.

10:59.446 --> 11:00.941
I love it.

11:00.942 --> 11:02.609
I need to borrow Mary
Jane for just a moment.

11:02.612 --> 11:04.565
Can I steal her for a second?

11:04.567 --> 11:07.192
All right, you guys
take turns sitting in my chair.

11:10.109 --> 11:11.901
Selling the dream, honey,
selling the dream.

11:11.904 --> 11:13.691
Yes, you are.

11:13.692 --> 11:15.859
You're gonna want to kiss me.
You found somebody to talk?

11:15.862 --> 11:18.984
Yes, I did. She's white, though.
- Oh.

11:18.987 --> 11:21.193
Yeah, I know you wanted a black girl,

11:21.196 --> 11:22.734
but my source over at the rescue center

11:22.737 --> 11:24.859
told me they just picked
this girl up two days ago,

11:24.862 --> 11:26.316
and she's been sold a few times.

11:26.318 --> 11:28.691
She's been in Atlanta for five months,

11:28.692 --> 11:30.172
and, uh, she goes

11:30.173 --> 11:32.691
by the street name "Polly".
- Seriously?

11:32.692 --> 11:35.193
A white girl named Polly?
- Yeah, well,

11:35.194 --> 11:36.316
probably being sarcastic.

11:36.318 --> 11:38.649
Anyway, she's 17 years old,

11:38.650 --> 11:40.359
and it was her suggestion
to meet you in person

11:40.363 --> 11:41.649
before going on air.

11:41.650 --> 11:43.982
So you're gonna meet her
at the pancake house

11:43.984 --> 11:47.255
on cheshire bridge road, and
I'll have security there

11:47.256 --> 11:48.732
in plain clothes, okay?

11:48.734 --> 11:51.109
We can do 9:00 or 9:30. - 9:00. Okay.

11:51.113 --> 11:53.693
Hey. Hey, Kara.
- Hi.

11:53.694 --> 11:54.816
I need to speak with you.

11:54.817 --> 11:56.193
I'm kind of in
the middle of something.

11:56.196 --> 11:57.859
No, it's okay. You can have her.

11:57.862 --> 11:59.734
I'm gonna go lock this in.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

11:59.737 --> 12:03.066
What's up?
- My parents are in town.

12:03.067 --> 12:05.026
They're on their layover
on their way to Paris,

12:05.029 --> 12:06.732
and they want to see us tonight.

12:06.734 --> 12:08.443
Just tell them I'm out of town.

12:08.446 --> 12:10.691
No, I can't. I panicked, I'm sorry.

12:10.692 --> 12:13.316
I can't be your beard tonight.
I can't. I can't.

12:13.318 --> 12:14.818
I've got the girls all afternoon,

12:14.821 --> 12:16.984
and then I have an interview
I can't move tonight.

12:17.287 --> 12:19.659
And I have to go to my house and
get my "I love mark" bag...

12:19.663 --> 12:21.117
See, yes, and I love you for that.

12:21.121 --> 12:24.449
Thank you. I owe you. I owe you.

12:24.451 --> 12:26.493
And you're gonna pay.

12:29.768 --> 12:32.432
Hey.
- Hey. What's up?

12:32.434 --> 12:36.599
I need you to take over for me. Please?

12:36.601 --> 12:40.057
You mean... Oh... oh, hell no.

12:40.059 --> 12:42.017
No, no, come on.
- No, no, no, no, no.

12:42.042 --> 12:44.777
I am busy preparing for Thursday's
show, are you out of your mind?

12:44.790 --> 12:47.094
I know, but I have to help a friend
with a serious personal matter;

12:47.125 --> 12:48.125
Come on, please.

12:48.127 --> 12:49.915
And, well, what would
that friend have done

12:49.919 --> 12:51.374
had you not picked up the
phone, can't they do that?

12:51.378 --> 12:52.999
But I did answer. That's the thing.

12:53.002 --> 12:55.207
Come on, they're just a
bunch of teenage girls.

12:55.211 --> 12:56.730
I'm having a hard enough time

12:56.731 --> 12:58.249
with pubescent boys.

13:01.082 --> 13:03.705
How long before you get back here?

13:03.707 --> 13:04.937
I'm not gonna come back.

13:04.938 --> 13:06.164
Oh, that's fabulous.

13:06.166 --> 13:08.082
That's just great. That's fabulous.

13:08.086 --> 13:09.707
Thank you. Thank you.
- Please don't do this to me.

13:09.710 --> 13:11.374
Thank you. They're gonna love you.

13:11.378 --> 13:12.414
They're patient.

13:12.416 --> 13:14.581
Okay, ladies, unfortunately,

13:14.583 --> 13:16.041
this is where I'm gonna
have to leave you,

13:16.044 --> 13:18.082
but you're in great hands with Kara.

13:18.086 --> 13:22.416
So be inspired, okay? Good luck,

13:22.417 --> 13:24.124
and I love you.

13:26.041 --> 13:29.499
Bye.

13:30.790 --> 13:33.562
Okay, well,

13:33.563 --> 13:36.331
let's go and check out editing.

13:36.333 --> 13:39.874
That's super exciting.
Come on. Follow me this way.

13:41.695 --> 13:45.705
You're a 43-year old, never
married, confirmed bachelor,

13:45.707 --> 13:48.705
whose girlfriend is
nearly always unavailable

13:48.707 --> 13:50.997
or somewhere else or with other people.

13:50.999 --> 13:53.164
Do you think you're fooling anyone?

13:53.166 --> 13:55.333
Just the people that matter.

13:56.707 --> 13:59.458
You're an ass.
- Are you speaking literally

13:59.459 --> 14:02.333
or figuratively, because either way,

14:02.334 --> 14:03.705
now is not the time for this.

14:03.707 --> 14:05.312
My parents are gonna be outside

14:05.313 --> 14:06.914
of that door in a few seconds,

14:06.915 --> 14:08.707
and I do not have time nor
do I feel it necessary

14:08.710 --> 14:10.914
for me to explain my personal decisions

14:10.915 --> 14:13.165
when it comes to my life.
- Your life?

14:13.181 --> 14:14.555
I thought we were in a relationship.

14:14.559 --> 14:16.013
Yes, my life.

14:16.014 --> 14:18.154
It is hard enough being black.

14:18.185 --> 14:20.127
Now you want me to add the
side dish of gay to my plate?

14:20.166 --> 14:21.971
Yes.
- For what?

14:22.286 --> 14:24.846
For who, Eric?

14:24.847 --> 14:27.550
We can be a relationship
from here to infinity,

14:27.573 --> 14:30.637
and you will never understand what
it is like to live in my skin.

14:30.639 --> 14:33.036
Neither will you until you

14:33.037 --> 14:35.430
fully accept who you are.

14:37.889 --> 14:40.221
Would you get out of here
with that soap opera?

14:40.223 --> 14:42.223
Stop trying to shut me
out of the conversation

14:42.226 --> 14:44.512
with your million man march rhetoric?

14:44.514 --> 14:48.679
What are you saying?
- I'm saying, don't race card me.

14:48.681 --> 14:52.347
If you're still afraid of
mommy and daddy, own it.

14:55.223 --> 14:57.412
I'm through with this conversation, Eric.

15:01.889 --> 15:03.920
Mark...

15:04.646 --> 15:06.653
Trust me.

15:06.973 --> 15:10.804
You don't have to do this.

15:10.806 --> 15:14.596
Do you think I like doing this?

15:14.597 --> 15:18.637
All right, the bath and
the bedroom both look very hetero.

15:18.639 --> 15:20.654
This place really straightens up

15:20.678 --> 15:23.221
well, if I do say so myself.

15:23.223 --> 15:25.483
Years of practice.

15:25.707 --> 15:27.971
Okay, what's wrong?

15:27.973 --> 15:30.016
Nothing, Mary Jane, nothing.

15:34.555 --> 15:36.601
Okay.

15:36.805 --> 15:39.182
They're here.

15:42.364 --> 15:44.197
Will you please leave
out of the back door?

15:44.201 --> 15:46.321
Please?

15:46.322 --> 15:48.030
How's he gonna
get to my place without...

15:48.033 --> 15:50.656
I'll figure it out.
- Wow.

15:56.901 --> 15:59.948
Mary Jane.

16:14.223 --> 16:16.721
Remember what I told you, okay?
Confidence.

16:16.722 --> 16:19.979
It was so nice meeting you girls.
I'm so proud of you.

16:20.011 --> 16:21.952
You're all beautiful. Good luck.

16:21.988 --> 16:23.693
Thank you for coming to visit.

16:24.959 --> 16:26.918
Can I go to the movies with the girls?

16:26.921 --> 16:28.100
You're ditching me.

16:28.114 --> 16:30.124
No, you still have to pick me.

16:30.812 --> 16:32.687
Please? It's the j. Law movie.

16:32.690 --> 16:34.811
Oh, j. Law, well, then, by all means.

16:34.812 --> 16:36.202
Okay, figure out then when,

16:36.218 --> 16:37.821
wheres, and with whoms.
- Okay.

16:38.459 --> 16:40.375
Okay, and I'm sure
you're gonna do great.

16:40.376 --> 16:42.501
I'm gonna see your faces
one day on the big screen.

16:42.504 --> 16:44.334
All right, good luck to you girls.

16:44.337 --> 16:47.001
Take care.
- Thank you again.
- Oh.

16:47.005 --> 16:49.270
My daughter really enjoyed herself today.

16:49.283 --> 16:50.658
Aw.
- Thank you for taking the time.

16:50.661 --> 16:52.697
I can only imagine how valuable it is.

16:52.699 --> 16:54.489
Of course.

16:54.490 --> 16:55.991
I'm Kara lynch, I don't think we've met.

16:55.994 --> 16:57.789
We did.
- We did?

16:57.844 --> 16:59.864
Yeah, you forgot me that quickly.

16:59.866 --> 17:01.490
I told you my daughter texted me.

17:01.494 --> 17:04.156
She was so excited a latina was a boss.

17:04.157 --> 17:05.891
Oh, oh.

17:05.892 --> 17:09.039
Anyway, thank you.
- Sure.

17:15.032 --> 17:16.406
Oh, my...

17:19.781 --> 17:22.948
You know what?
I completely remember you.

17:22.949 --> 17:24.824
I am so sorry.
I did not mean to be rude.

17:24.827 --> 17:26.741
I just met so many people tonight.

17:26.743 --> 17:29.739
It's okay.
- Yeah, and you're welcome.

17:29.741 --> 17:31.490
Really. My pleasure.

17:31.494 --> 17:33.721
Hey, do you know where I, uh,

17:33.722 --> 17:35.948
I can get a drink around here?

17:35.949 --> 17:38.697
A drink? Um...

17:38.699 --> 17:40.031
Oh, yeah, no, not that place.

17:40.033 --> 17:42.281
That's kind of nasty.

17:42.283 --> 17:43.991
Um...
- Oh, nothing fancy.

17:43.994 --> 17:45.532
I just need somewhere to park

17:45.555 --> 17:47.403
while I wait on my daughter
to watch a movie.

17:47.887 --> 17:50.288
Oh, well, okay.

17:50.332 --> 17:51.551
Um,

17:52.579 --> 17:53.579
uh,

17:54.626 --> 17:56.626
you know what? Pick a desk.

17:56.682 --> 17:58.240
I know where the cups are.

17:58.241 --> 18:02.864
You like Tequila? Come on.
- Why not?

18:02.866 --> 18:04.991
So we were just about done with dinner.

18:04.994 --> 18:09.281
Mind you, the restaurant
was freezing cold.

18:09.283 --> 18:11.073
My hands were like ice.

18:11.074 --> 18:12.614
Yeah, so I'm reaching out,

18:12.615 --> 18:14.849
like, grabbing her hands so I
can see how cold they were.

18:14.876 --> 18:17.535
Then the violinist comes

18:17.571 --> 18:19.769
and surrounds the table.

18:19.784 --> 18:23.531
Playing Beethoven's ode
to joy, none the less.

18:23.532 --> 18:26.864
Manager comes with a
cake and a bottle of champagne

18:26.866 --> 18:28.637
to celebrate our engagement.

18:28.660 --> 18:32.031
Oh, so let's see the ring.

18:32.033 --> 18:33.615
I'll tell them. I'll tell them.
- Okay, okay, okay.

18:33.619 --> 18:35.824
So that's the punch line, dad.

18:35.827 --> 18:38.864
It was for the table that was next to us.

18:38.866 --> 18:40.240
So embarrassing.

18:40.241 --> 18:41.991
We were sitting there like, "what?"

18:41.994 --> 18:44.240
Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no, too soon.

18:44.241 --> 18:48.052
Exactly. And the manager
was so nice, though.

18:48.068 --> 18:50.990
He gave us a bottle
of champagne for our troubles.

18:51.326 --> 18:54.432
So do your parents approve of mark?

18:54.479 --> 18:56.406
Of course, yeah, they love mark.

18:56.408 --> 18:58.824
They are like a broken record with mark.

18:58.827 --> 19:00.242
"Where's mark? How's mark?

19:00.243 --> 19:01.656
Mark, mark, mark, mark, mark."

19:01.657 --> 19:04.281
I think they love mark
more than they love me.

19:04.283 --> 19:07.031
Well, you two have been a
couple almost two years now.

19:07.033 --> 19:09.281
When do you intend to marry her,

19:09.283 --> 19:11.659
or at least buy her the real ring?

19:12.449 --> 19:15.240
Well, you know, we've talked
about it from time to time.

19:15.241 --> 19:16.824
Mm-hmm, yeah.
- Yes.

19:16.827 --> 19:20.031
Our schedules are very busy, so,
you know, hard to try to...

19:20.033 --> 19:22.407
No one's that busy, mark.

19:23.782 --> 19:27.781
Oh, the canapés.

19:27.782 --> 19:30.657
Yes.
- All right, let me go get them.
- Stop it.

19:32.074 --> 19:36.240
Just stop it.
- Stop what?

19:36.241 --> 19:37.554
Mom... mom, let me go get those

19:37.555 --> 19:39.866
before they burn. I'll be right back.

19:45.824 --> 19:49.572
So, uh, mark and I took the most amazing

19:49.574 --> 19:53.156
snowboarding trip to Colorado last year.

19:53.158 --> 19:56.783
We loved it. That's a lie.

19:56.784 --> 19:58.198
Mark loved. I hated it.

19:58.199 --> 20:00.447
Snowboarding did nothing for me.

20:00.449 --> 20:02.283
Sounds like a death wish.

20:02.286 --> 20:04.614
Literally, as I was
nearly going head over tail.

20:06.365 --> 20:07.949
Well, I'll stick with fly-fishing.

20:07.952 --> 20:09.574
Exactly.

20:09.577 --> 20:11.033
Oh, I was just telling
your parents about our...

20:11.036 --> 20:12.824
Our snowboarding trip to copper Mountain.

20:12.827 --> 20:14.948
Oh, yeah, copper Mountain was good.

20:14.949 --> 20:16.137
Yeah, you loved it.

20:16.138 --> 20:17.322
I did love it, I must say.

20:17.324 --> 20:20.822
Look, dad, this here, speaking of great,

20:20.824 --> 20:26.156
1964 barolo, baby.
- Oh-ho-ho, sounds good.

20:26.158 --> 20:29.634
You know, they don't serve
anything decent on those flights.

20:30.074 --> 20:32.574
Mark, I know you're gay.

20:34.866 --> 20:37.156
Beatrice, what the hell's
the matter with you?

20:37.158 --> 20:39.116
What are you talking about, mom?

20:39.119 --> 20:41.442
I gave life to you,

20:42.475 --> 20:45.364
and I want to share
that life with you,

20:45.365 --> 20:50.026
but I can't if you keep
hiding parts of it from us.

20:53.699 --> 20:55.577
Just say the words.

20:58.407 --> 21:00.657
I promise it's okay.

21:02.283 --> 21:05.240
Mama.
- Just say the words, baby.

21:05.241 --> 21:08.824
What are you talking about, mom?

21:10.241 --> 21:12.116
I'm gonna go get the wine opener.

21:12.119 --> 21:14.590
Mark, it's in your hand.

21:16.699 --> 21:18.116
Sit down.

21:19.699 --> 21:21.167
Sit down.

21:22.553 --> 21:23.824
Sit.

21:33.824 --> 21:36.010
You're a homosexual?

21:36.408 --> 21:38.067
You?

21:40.874 --> 21:42.147
Yeah.

21:44.431 --> 21:45.569
Me.

21:49.490 --> 21:51.949
When did this happen?

21:54.657 --> 21:56.989
I've always been gay, dad.

21:56.991 --> 22:00.948
Uh-uh, not when we taught you to walk.

22:00.949 --> 22:03.781
Not when you were in little league.

22:03.782 --> 22:06.991
Not when you were prom king,
you wasn't anybody's homosexual.
- Stan, Stan...

22:08.639 --> 22:10.272
I'm just gay, dad.

22:10.295 --> 22:12.272
No, I'm gay.
I'm happy as a June bug.

22:12.295 --> 22:14.802
That doesn't mean I go
around sucking men's...
- Stan.

22:15.824 --> 22:18.426
It's okay, mom.
- No, it's not okay, son.

22:18.907 --> 22:20.866
Your mom and I raised
you in an atmosphere

22:20.869 --> 22:23.405
where you could be honest with us,

22:23.407 --> 22:26.653
and you've been lying your whole life.

22:27.532 --> 22:29.241
And honestly, that's more important to me

22:29.245 --> 22:32.785
than who is literally up your ass.
- Stan.

22:34.158 --> 22:36.137
I tell you I'm gay,

22:36.138 --> 22:38.114
and you make this all about you.

22:38.116 --> 22:39.822
No, you didn't tell me squat.

22:39.824 --> 22:41.866
Your mother just told me, and you
confirmed with a weak "yup".

22:41.869 --> 22:43.597
Big difference, son.

22:44.615 --> 22:46.074
And I'm not making this about me.

22:46.078 --> 22:48.616
I'm making this about us.

22:50.615 --> 22:52.319
Who are you?

22:52.991 --> 22:54.699
The son we raised would
have had the courage

22:54.702 --> 22:56.467
to be whoever the hell he is,

22:56.889 --> 22:59.695
no matter what anybody thought
about him, including me.

23:00.283 --> 23:02.408
But instead, you've been
running around like a thief

23:02.410 --> 23:05.866
in the night, lying and pulling
others into your lies.

23:08.907 --> 23:11.031
Is that who you are?

23:11.033 --> 23:12.949
Is that the man I raised?

23:15.949 --> 23:19.198
And you knew this whole time?

23:19.199 --> 23:21.680
Mothers often know.

23:21.682 --> 23:24.031
Mark is gay.

23:24.033 --> 23:26.572
That doesn't mean he
chose to be that way.

23:26.574 --> 23:28.407
Oh, Beatrice, stop sounding like a psa,

23:28.410 --> 23:30.158
I don't give a damn whether
he chose it or not.

23:30.161 --> 23:32.405
Do you I want you to live
that lifestyle? Hell no.

23:32.407 --> 23:34.406
But whatever happened in our relationship

23:34.408 --> 23:36.033
where you felt you had to lie about it,

23:36.036 --> 23:38.490
where you couldn't be honest with me?

23:40.241 --> 23:42.548
I lied to you, because
you're a homophobe.

23:44.033 --> 23:45.657
You may not want to
admit it, but you are.

23:45.661 --> 23:47.662
No, you lied because it was easy.

23:49.615 --> 23:51.407
And yes, I am a homophobe.

23:51.410 --> 23:52.866
So is damn near half the country.

23:52.869 --> 23:56.075
But I'm also your father,
who loves and trusts that

23:56.076 --> 23:57.614
his son would have the decency

23:57.615 --> 24:00.407
to share a very important
part of his life with us.

24:05.033 --> 24:06.991
Is that why you always
put your mother off

24:06.994 --> 24:08.615
when she wants to come and visit?

24:21.727 --> 24:23.836
Oh, um,

24:24.640 --> 24:28.399
sorry, this is that important
interview I told you about.

25:35.407 --> 25:37.408
Mary Jane Paul?

25:39.824 --> 25:42.527
You're even prettier than on the set.

25:43.449 --> 25:45.107
You must be Polly.

25:45.574 --> 25:47.169
Yeah.

25:47.490 --> 25:51.013
A happy meal every day
for a year and a half.

25:51.193 --> 25:52.739
It's $2.

25:53.866 --> 25:55.304
Disgusting.

25:55.342 --> 25:57.474
Just made me think,

25:58.376 --> 25:59.571
realy?

25:59.699 --> 26:02.240
I'm not even worth $5?

26:02.241 --> 26:05.186
I'm worth less than a pack of condoms?

26:07.283 --> 26:09.531
Why don't you tell me about your day?

26:09.532 --> 26:11.531
What did you do today?

26:12.407 --> 26:15.782
Nothing. Watched TV.
Watched your show.

26:15.784 --> 26:17.073
Thank you.

26:17.096 --> 26:19.079
And later I took a
shower and got dressed,

26:19.087 --> 26:22.259
'cause there's a convention
in town, mad money,

26:22.283 --> 26:23.781
but I was on the blob, so...

26:23.782 --> 26:25.283
I'm sorry. You're what?

26:25.286 --> 26:28.198
On my period.
- Right, okay.
- Tricks hate that.

26:28.199 --> 26:30.614
Blood just freaks them out, I guess.

26:30.615 --> 26:32.405
They get violent sometimes.

26:32.407 --> 26:34.741
I had to keep the lights low
so they wouldn't notice.

26:37.615 --> 26:40.405
Am I weirding you out?
- No. Mm-mm.

26:40.407 --> 26:43.992
No, I'm fine. Um, did you,

26:43.993 --> 26:45.948
or do you go to school?

26:45.949 --> 26:49.184
I'm registered at
deerfield, but I don't go.

26:49.676 --> 26:52.181
Deerfield high school?

26:53.050 --> 26:54.775
How old are you?

26:55.955 --> 26:58.165
For real?
- Yeah.

26:59.260 --> 27:00.886
15.

27:02.490 --> 27:04.184
Am I too old for the show?

27:04.872 --> 27:07.699
No. Mm-mm. No, you're fine.

27:14.161 --> 27:17.069
Well, Mary Jane's not my boss.

27:17.090 --> 27:19.405
She's more like a partner, if anything.

27:19.407 --> 27:21.075
Why does she have the office,

27:21.076 --> 27:24.304
and you're in a fancy, like, open,

27:24.305 --> 27:27.447
working area thing?

27:27.449 --> 27:29.699
Well, that's how the news
room works, you know?

27:29.702 --> 27:33.405
I have to be out here with
my producers and my writers

27:33.407 --> 27:35.199
and make sure the stories are going right

27:35.203 --> 27:37.489
and be right in the middle
of the action, you know?

27:37.490 --> 27:39.656
Because everybody reports to me.

27:39.657 --> 27:42.731
Why do women do that?
- Do what?

27:42.872 --> 27:46.239
Oversell themselves.
- Wow.

27:46.532 --> 27:48.281
Maybe it's because you

27:48.283 --> 27:51.240
questioned my work area as less than?

27:51.241 --> 27:54.193
No, no, I was simply
asking a question.
- Oh.

27:54.209 --> 27:56.116
Yeah, so that I could have
a better understanding.

27:56.119 --> 27:59.884
Oh, okay. All right. Well, I mean, I...

28:00.150 --> 28:02.367
I hate that I don't have
an office, but I doubt

28:02.367 --> 28:04.166
that I'd ever be in it.

28:04.756 --> 28:06.490
It is nice to have perks, though.

28:06.494 --> 28:09.119
Well, you have a nice view.
- I do.

28:09.275 --> 28:12.860
I love my view. It is beautiful.

28:14.791 --> 28:16.790
So is this...

28:16.792 --> 28:18.709
Career peak, or are you
still on the climb?

28:18.711 --> 28:21.205
You don't drink Tequila.

28:21.207 --> 28:24.247
Um, the climb.

28:24.249 --> 28:26.791
You know, it's funny; Everybody
is always congratulating me.

28:26.794 --> 28:29.081
"Wow, you've made it," you know?

28:29.083 --> 28:31.000
And I'm just thinking, "pssh,

28:31.001 --> 28:32.914
I'm just getting started."

28:32.916 --> 28:34.791
Where are you trying to get to?

28:36.332 --> 28:39.497
I want to win an emmy for
producing nightly news.

28:39.499 --> 28:41.415
On network. I mean, cable's cool.

28:41.419 --> 28:45.497
But network will always
be the holy grail for me.

28:45.499 --> 28:47.290
Was that a big part of your divorce?

28:50.499 --> 28:51.914
Yeah.

28:52.468 --> 28:55.026
That, and...

28:57.083 --> 28:58.666
I was the breadwinner...

29:00.083 --> 29:03.664
And him screwing our real estate agent.

29:03.666 --> 29:05.637
That was a good one.

29:07.582 --> 29:08.800
What?

29:08.925 --> 29:11.040
Is your ex a real estate agent?

29:11.041 --> 29:12.499
What's your ex-husband's name?

29:14.541 --> 29:16.351
Seriously?

29:17.625 --> 29:19.937
John lynch.

29:19.980 --> 29:23.748
What?
- Oh, shoot.

29:23.749 --> 29:25.084
Wouldn't that have been weird?

29:25.116 --> 29:28.664
You are... that was good.

29:28.666 --> 29:31.539
My heart actually stopped
beating for a second.

29:31.541 --> 29:34.207
That was good.

29:37.374 --> 29:40.413
May I take you out for a
proper drink one night?

29:41.217 --> 29:42.424
Mm...

29:44.244 --> 29:47.606
Mm...
- Okay, earlier I wasn't memorable.

29:47.624 --> 29:50.374
Now I'm not dateable.
- I'm sorry. No, no, no.

29:50.377 --> 29:52.998
Listen, you seem like
a really decent guy.

29:52.999 --> 29:56.247
I'm just... I'm not interested
in dating right now.

29:56.249 --> 29:58.594
I'm just... eesh, please.

29:59.196 --> 30:00.477
I, um...

30:03.332 --> 30:05.998
I don't really date Latino men.

30:05.999 --> 30:07.456
No offense.

30:07.457 --> 30:09.874
Well, then, you shouldn't
have said anything,

30:09.878 --> 30:12.622
because I am very offended.

30:12.624 --> 30:15.725
I mean...
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

30:15.756 --> 30:17.456
No, I... Listen, I love my people.

30:17.457 --> 30:19.290
I really do, but it's just...

30:19.294 --> 30:22.192
It just never seems to work out.

30:22.239 --> 30:25.247
In fact, I just dated a Mexican guy...

30:25.249 --> 30:27.581
Carlos, the intern.

30:27.582 --> 30:29.083
Maybe because he was the intern.

30:29.086 --> 30:32.914
Maybe. Good point.

30:32.916 --> 30:35.581
Listen, I'm just trying
to save you the trouble.

30:35.582 --> 30:38.122
I don't have a lot of time,
and I don't like to waste it,

30:38.124 --> 30:41.914
so I like to be up front and very clear.

30:41.916 --> 30:44.372
You know, I just came out of the fog.

30:44.374 --> 30:46.587
Why are you laughing?

30:46.595 --> 30:48.622
You're doing it again.
- What?

30:48.624 --> 30:49.999
Overselling it.

30:52.161 --> 30:53.687
Just like you want an office,

30:53.688 --> 30:55.837
you want to see me again.

30:55.853 --> 30:58.189
It's just easier if you
say you don't want it.

31:01.457 --> 31:03.956
Really? Okay.

31:03.958 --> 31:05.749
I think I'll have another drink.

31:08.791 --> 31:11.706
Well, the movie's over.

31:11.707 --> 31:14.207
I should get going.

31:22.249 --> 31:24.250
Let me know if you want
to get that drink.

31:25.541 --> 31:28.207
Good night.
- Adios.

31:40.541 --> 31:43.999
Gael Montoya.

31:50.833 --> 31:53.457
Ah, mi dio.

31:55.791 --> 31:57.114
For real?

31:58.224 --> 31:59.960
Men are gross.

32:00.591 --> 32:01.981
They fart.

32:02.036 --> 32:04.206
They have skids marks on their underwear,

32:04.208 --> 32:05.831
and their hair all greasy.

32:05.833 --> 32:09.122
Sometimes I put a little vicks
under my nose to mask the smell.

32:09.499 --> 32:10.997
My mom used to say,

32:11.271 --> 32:13.271
"there's men who shower before work,

32:13.582 --> 32:16.372
"and there's men who shower after work.

32:16.491 --> 32:19.319
"The men who shower before work
have more money,

32:19.749 --> 32:21.946
but they're sadder too."

32:22.791 --> 32:26.247
Some of them don't want to have sex.

32:26.249 --> 32:28.748
They just want me to listen to them.

32:28.749 --> 32:30.604
They're the saddest.

32:31.958 --> 32:34.458
Polly isn't your real name, is it?

32:35.396 --> 32:37.396
No.

32:38.207 --> 32:39.499
What is your real name?

32:41.958 --> 32:43.792
I don't want to tell you that.

32:44.058 --> 32:46.058
Okay.

32:46.083 --> 32:48.499
Tell me why you chose Polly.

32:53.332 --> 32:56.738
Polly was my imaginary friend growing up.

32:57.624 --> 32:59.592
She always protected me.

33:00.083 --> 33:03.732
So when a trick wants to...

33:04.207 --> 33:07.459
Tie me down... Give me a facial

33:07.482 --> 33:09.242
or a golden shower,

33:11.083 --> 33:13.414
it's not happening to me.

33:13.415 --> 33:16.041
It's happening to Polly.

33:19.083 --> 33:21.260
Young girls need to hear your story.

33:21.874 --> 33:23.509
They do.

33:23.999 --> 33:26.083
You know how many young
girls just like you

33:26.086 --> 33:28.205
have been kidnapped and enslaved

33:28.207 --> 33:31.205
or beaten and drugged,

33:31.207 --> 33:33.372
made dependent on men,

33:33.374 --> 33:34.905
who take their power,

33:34.944 --> 33:37.557
their souls, their freedom?

33:37.874 --> 33:40.914
Use my show as your platform.

33:40.916 --> 33:42.504
Tell your story.

33:45.440 --> 33:47.440
How much do you pay?

33:48.207 --> 33:49.675
We don't.

33:50.214 --> 33:52.346
We're a news program,

33:52.378 --> 33:54.362
so we don't pay for stories.

33:54.858 --> 33:57.528
Did someone on your staff tell you
you'd be getting paid for this?

33:59.318 --> 34:01.318
Well, no.

34:01.374 --> 34:04.205
Um... If people like Katy Perry

34:04.207 --> 34:05.456
get paid for their stories...

34:05.457 --> 34:06.873
Yes, they do.

34:06.874 --> 34:10.289
I'm not looking for $1
million or anything,

34:10.290 --> 34:12.415
but my story should be worth something.

34:12.418 --> 34:15.748
No, it is, and while we
can't pay you money,

34:15.748 --> 34:18.539
what we can do is put you in
contact with social services...

34:18.541 --> 34:20.498
Have you been listening to me?

34:22.206 --> 34:26.748
It's always about the money.

34:26.748 --> 34:28.873
You could save some young girl's life.

34:31.541 --> 34:33.041
Come on. Go get in the car.

34:33.045 --> 34:35.184
No, wait, just wait.
- Move when I tell you to move.

34:35.215 --> 34:36.831
Wait, hold on. Polly.

34:36.833 --> 34:38.333
Polly, wait. Oh, okay, I'll buy her.

34:38.335 --> 34:40.290
I'll buy her.
How much? How much?

34:40.293 --> 34:43.206
All right, 20,000.

34:44.498 --> 34:47.081
Okay, so, I can have her for $20,000?

34:47.083 --> 34:48.539
Yep.

34:48.541 --> 34:50.206
Okay, just let me get my
checkbook, and I'll be...

34:50.210 --> 34:51.735
Checkbook?
- I'll come right back.

34:51.752 --> 34:54.741
Bitch, please, what you think
this is, hoes r us?

34:54.759 --> 34:57.125
No, no, no, no, wait, just
a second, just a second.

34:57.149 --> 34:58.982
No, if you just... Just
leave her here with me,

34:58.986 --> 35:00.454
I will go get the money;
It's a lot of cash...

35:00.470 --> 35:01.767
Do you have the cash now?

35:01.798 --> 35:03.446
No, I don't have it on me,
but just leave her...

35:03.469 --> 35:05.086
Go get your ass in the car.
- I'm good for it.

35:05.109 --> 35:06.906
Get your ass in the car.

35:23.360 --> 35:27.460
Well, my first pimp,
jace, he was beautiful.

35:27.640 --> 35:30.335
You know, beautiful, beautiful.
You don't know.

35:30.358 --> 35:34.087
He had one of thos
real tight curly afros,

35:34.111 --> 35:35.633
like one of those...

35:35.837 --> 35:40.288
those guys from the black
power movement in the 60s.

35:41.277 --> 35:42.602
Black power.

35:42.994 --> 35:44.994
You know, he

35:45.290 --> 35:49.818
met me outside of the
laundromat on lyndon boulevard,

35:49.819 --> 35:53.442
and he gave me some change for my dryer.

35:53.444 --> 35:55.577
You know, that was it.

35:55.788 --> 35:57.788
He turned me out.

35:57.903 --> 36:01.442
He never hit me or beat me

36:01.444 --> 36:04.026
or made me have sex with him,

36:04.028 --> 36:07.632
except for that one
time, you know...

36:07.633 --> 36:10.317
I came up short,
at the end of the night.
- Hey.

36:10.319 --> 36:12.317
Hey, what are you doing here?

36:12.319 --> 36:16.275
Well, same as you.

36:16.277 --> 36:18.359
There is work to be done.

36:18.360 --> 36:21.348
No, I mean, why aren't
you out with Eric doing what...

36:21.563 --> 36:24.611
newly out of the closet gay men do?

36:26.485 --> 36:28.275
Uh-oh.

36:28.277 --> 36:31.734
Eric and I have parted ways.
- What?
- Yeah.

36:31.736 --> 36:34.690
Baby, what happened?
- It was ugly.

36:36.028 --> 36:38.028
Spending time at your place

36:38.029 --> 36:40.026
gave him time to figure it out

36:40.028 --> 36:42.748
and think about our relationship.

36:43.819 --> 36:47.706
Said he and I didn't have
one, and you and I...

36:48.355 --> 36:50.734
...did.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

36:50.736 --> 36:53.277
How the... how the hell did I get
brought into the middle of this?

36:53.280 --> 36:55.901
All I ever did was support you guys.

36:55.903 --> 36:57.352
Mary Jane,

36:57.573 --> 36:59.310
he's right.

36:59.394 --> 37:01.181
How do you figure?

37:01.277 --> 37:03.442
The sex was better than good.

37:03.444 --> 37:05.651
The guy was talented,

37:05.652 --> 37:09.228
but during the daylight hours,
we were just marking time,

37:10.652 --> 37:12.964
sometimes getting beneath the surface,

37:12.983 --> 37:14.566
but no real depth.

37:17.277 --> 37:19.692
Maybe because I was straddling the fence.

37:19.694 --> 37:21.278
But you just came out to your parents.

37:21.280 --> 37:23.842
Doesn't that mean anything?
- Of course.

37:24.092 --> 37:26.028
But look who I shared it with.

37:28.360 --> 37:29.734
Right.

37:30.946 --> 37:32.703
So...

37:33.086 --> 37:35.086
I am going to be pouring

37:35.111 --> 37:39.818
a balvenie 21-year-old in my office

37:39.819 --> 37:41.567
if you want to join me.

37:41.569 --> 37:43.277
I will be right there.

And my friend.

37:50.710 --> 37:52.731
You're welcome.

37:54.696 --> 37:57.475
Oh, how did your, uh, interview go?

37:57.506 --> 37:59.271
It came, and
it went, which is now why

and I woke up in this

It was pitch black, and he just...

He had these two guys
