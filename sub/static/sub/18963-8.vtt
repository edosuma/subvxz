00:39.140 --> 00:41.209
Scott, it's adorable.

00:44.112 --> 00:45.246
Look at us.

00:45.313 --> 00:46.980
Our own little corner house,

00:47.047 --> 00:48.416
just like real marrieds.

00:48.482 --> 00:50.951
Max really came through.

00:51.018 --> 00:52.686
All right.

00:58.159 --> 00:59.793
Oh. No, no.

00:59.860 --> 01:01.795
Just like real marrieds.

01:06.867 --> 01:08.136
Oh.

01:10.804 --> 01:12.706
They forgot the furniture.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.842
Or we did.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.810
This is not the Biltmore.

01:23.384 --> 01:26.153
Smell that sea air.

01:26.154 --> 01:28.822
Our very own kitchen.

01:29.957 --> 01:31.792
It's a clean slate.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.728
Now there's a metaphor.

01:36.164 --> 01:37.831
It's exactly what we need.

01:37.898 --> 01:39.066
Yes.

01:39.167 --> 01:41.068
Who needs possessions?

01:41.169 --> 01:42.836
We're free of everything.

01:42.903 --> 01:44.772
I feel lighter already.

01:48.176 --> 01:50.043
Oh, Scott, look.

01:50.178 --> 01:51.779
There's your water, darling.

02:04.892 --> 02:06.494
Oh, Scott.

02:08.929 --> 02:10.798
How beautiful.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.734
So much for a little thing.

02:15.536 --> 02:16.737
Whoo!

02:25.779 --> 02:27.448
It's so quiet.

02:27.515 --> 02:28.716
Hmm.

02:28.782 --> 02:31.219
Thank God for our lucky hammock,

02:31.285 --> 02:32.886
heroically saving us

02:32.953 --> 02:35.456
from the cold, hard ground.

02:38.392 --> 02:40.561
Do any two people
work better together

02:40.628 --> 02:41.662
than we do?

02:41.729 --> 02:45.366
Hmm. Nobody's got
a right to live but us.

02:46.567 --> 02:49.236
That's a delightfully
morbid thought.

02:49.237 --> 02:51.272
I don't think
it's morbid at all.

02:51.339 --> 02:53.341
I think it's
as bright as they come.

02:53.407 --> 02:55.909
Full of hope and potential,

02:55.976 --> 02:57.711
like a new book.

02:58.979 --> 03:00.681
Starting tomorrow,

03:00.748 --> 03:02.450
you'll fill this house
with your words,

03:02.516 --> 03:04.685
and I will be the perfect wife

03:04.752 --> 03:07.621
and make this house
a beautiful home.

03:33.347 --> 03:35.383
Hello, boys.
Come on in.

03:36.517 --> 03:40.053
Isn't this the best
place to start?

03:40.120 --> 03:41.722
Upstairs, room to your right.

03:41.789 --> 03:42.890
Yes, ma'am.

04:04.011 --> 04:05.313
Maybe I'll learn.

04:05.346 --> 04:06.814
Wonderful.

04:09.383 --> 04:12.320
Off to battle.
Wish me well.

04:29.803 --> 04:32.373
♫ When whippoorwills call ♫

04:32.440 --> 04:34.742
♫ And evening is nigh ♫

04:34.808 --> 04:39.513
♫ I hurry to my blue heaven ♫

04:39.580 --> 04:42.115
♫ A turn to the right ♫

04:42.182 --> 04:44.485
♫ A little white light ♫

04:44.552 --> 04:49.457
♫ Will lead you
to my blue heaven ♫

04:49.523 --> 04:52.192
♫ A smiling face,
a fireplace ♫

04:52.259 --> 04:54.495
- ♫ A cozy room ♫
- Oh, damn.

04:54.562 --> 04:59.032
♫ A little nest, that nest
is where the roses bloom ♫

04:59.099 --> 05:01.369
♫ Just Molly and me ♫

05:01.435 --> 05:03.837
♫ The baby makes three ♫

05:03.904 --> 05:08.642
♫ We're happy
in my blue heaven ♫

05:25.426 --> 05:27.561
Where are my shirts?

05:28.562 --> 05:30.230
This business of laundry:

05:30.297 --> 05:31.599
you wash a thing,

05:31.665 --> 05:33.133
then you have to wash it again

05:33.200 --> 05:34.635
and again and again and again.

05:34.702 --> 05:37.571
I ask you, what is the point?

05:37.638 --> 05:39.039
Let's not wear any clothes.

05:39.106 --> 05:41.775
We're at the beach.
Who needs them?

05:41.842 --> 05:44.978
We certainly don't.
We're clean.

05:45.045 --> 05:47.247
Not polished pan clean
like Townsend.

05:47.314 --> 05:48.215
We're different.

05:48.281 --> 05:49.883
We're blowy clean,

05:49.950 --> 05:52.119
like rivers and streams.

05:53.286 --> 05:54.955
Blowy clean.

05:56.156 --> 05:57.257
What?

05:58.426 --> 05:59.893
I won't wear any, then.

06:19.947 --> 06:21.815
- Hello?
- Tilde.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.884
Zelda, what is it?
What's wrong?

06:23.951 --> 06:26.620
There's nothing wrong.
Why does something
have to be wrong?

06:26.687 --> 06:29.122
You're phoning me, aren't you?

06:29.189 --> 06:30.924
The telephone is
for communication

06:30.991 --> 06:32.526
of importance or urgency.

06:32.593 --> 06:34.928
Well, I urgently
need some company.

06:34.995 --> 06:37.464
Scott's been writing
night and day.

06:37.465 --> 06:39.567
Luddy has forsaken me.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.969
Please say you'll come visit.

06:43.270 --> 06:44.772
Do you hear what I'm
contending with?

06:44.838 --> 06:47.007
Hmm. Well, don't bring
the children, then.

06:47.074 --> 06:50.377
Zelda, my hands
are more than full,

06:50.478 --> 06:52.613
and yours should be,
too. You're married.

06:52.680 --> 06:54.515
It's time you and Scott
had a baby.

06:54.582 --> 06:56.584
It's the natural order
of things.

06:56.650 --> 06:58.486
Might be for everyone else.

06:58.519 --> 07:00.488
Zelda, I'm at a loss, sister.

07:00.554 --> 07:02.155
Now call your neighbors in.

07:02.222 --> 07:03.757
Uh, Zelda, I...

07:03.824 --> 07:05.993
I have to hang up
the phone. I'm sorry.

07:38.726 --> 07:40.227
Henry, get over here.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.529
I told you not to get wet.

07:41.562 --> 07:42.996
Out of the water.

07:43.063 --> 07:46.233
No dessert for you.
Come on. We're going home.

07:46.299 --> 07:47.535
Henry.

07:47.568 --> 07:49.069
Let's go.

08:37.951 --> 08:40.386
- Scott...
- I was in the middle
of the thought.

08:40.453 --> 08:41.621
I'm sorry. I j...

08:41.688 --> 08:43.256
Could you perhaps knock?

08:53.100 --> 08:54.702
Come in.

08:55.936 --> 08:58.305
Goofo, I'm losing my mind.

08:58.371 --> 09:01.141
The house, the work of it.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.710
I hate cooking.

09:02.776 --> 09:05.212
Is this really what we wanted?

09:05.278 --> 09:06.714
Let's go into the city.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.348
Haven't we just left?

09:08.415 --> 09:09.850
That was ages ago.

09:09.917 --> 09:12.019
- It was a week.
- Maybe for you in here,

09:12.085 --> 09:13.286
but not for me.

09:13.353 --> 09:14.622
Without the sun to remind me,

09:14.688 --> 09:16.624
I'd hardly know
where one dull day ends

09:16.690 --> 09:18.291
and the next begins.

09:18.358 --> 09:19.627
I... I have to finish...

09:19.660 --> 09:22.429
I know you're working
on your novel,

09:22.495 --> 09:25.498
but can't we have a little fun?

09:25.633 --> 09:28.335
Surely you've earned
a break by now.

09:28.401 --> 09:29.970
We'll go,

09:30.037 --> 09:32.840
and we'll come
right straight back.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.375
You can't tell me you don't
want to see this body

09:35.442 --> 09:37.645
in feathers and pearls.

09:40.547 --> 09:42.683
You're right. I can't.

09:47.721 --> 09:48.922
But I can't stop now,

09:48.989 --> 09:50.858
not when I'm
in the middle of it.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.160
You understand,
don't you, darling?

10:19.086 --> 10:21.288
Zelda, what the devil
is that sme...

10:21.354 --> 10:24.124
Oh, shit. Aah!

10:24.191 --> 10:25.492
Hot!

10:25.558 --> 10:27.260
Did you not see this?

10:27.327 --> 10:28.595
It's just a little grease.

10:28.662 --> 10:30.597
It'll burn itself out.
it always does.

10:32.399 --> 10:33.533
What is the matter with you?

10:33.600 --> 10:34.968
It's out now.

10:35.035 --> 10:36.436
Do you have to make such a fuss?

10:36.503 --> 10:39.940
Yes! You do realize that we
don't own this house.

10:40.007 --> 10:41.709
Look at this place.
It's a mess.

10:41.775 --> 10:43.176
And I'm working myself
to the bone.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.879
On what?
What are you writing?

10:45.946 --> 10:47.748
You never show me
anything anymore.

10:47.815 --> 10:50.450
Because I don't have
anything to show.

10:50.517 --> 10:52.619
I'm writing.

10:52.686 --> 10:55.255
I sit there, and I'm writing.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.991
So please, can you just...

10:58.058 --> 11:01.094
try and not send
everything up in flames.

12:04.557 --> 12:05.793
Excuse me.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.261
Hello, Mrs. Fitzgerald.

12:08.328 --> 12:09.362
I am Tanaka Fujimori

12:09.429 --> 12:12.165
from the Japanese Reliable
Employment Agency.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.600
Tana...

12:13.666 --> 12:14.701
Tanaka.

12:14.802 --> 12:15.936
You can call me Tana.

12:16.003 --> 12:18.038
Easier. More American.

12:18.105 --> 12:18.906
Oh.

12:18.972 --> 12:20.707
Mr. Scott hired me.

12:20.808 --> 12:22.375
He says you need help.

12:23.977 --> 12:26.579
Well, who doesn't?

12:26.646 --> 12:28.348
It's okay, Mrs. Fitzgerald.

12:28.415 --> 12:29.850
Tana's here now.

13:29.910 --> 13:32.745
Do you need something,
Mrs. Fitzgerald?

13:32.880 --> 13:36.183
No. I'm fine.

13:44.624 --> 13:46.326
Good evening,
Mrs. Fitzgerald.

13:46.393 --> 13:47.895
Oh. Hello, Tana.

13:49.529 --> 13:53.100
Mr. Scott says you only
like plain food.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.503
Plain chicken, plain rice.

13:58.471 --> 14:00.073
Would you tell Mr. Scott...

14:00.140 --> 14:02.542
Would you tell Scott
we're ready for dinner?

14:02.609 --> 14:03.743
No.

14:03.810 --> 14:05.045
Mr. Scott
is eating dinner

14:05.112 --> 14:06.546
in his study tonight.

14:06.613 --> 14:08.515
Oh.

14:08.581 --> 14:10.150
I'll take his try in, then.

14:10.217 --> 14:12.452
Mrs. Fitzgerald, please, sit.

14:12.519 --> 14:13.686
Eat.

14:13.753 --> 14:16.656
No. I'll take him his tray.

14:16.723 --> 14:18.458
Mr. Scott asked me.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.160
He's working.

14:38.378 --> 14:41.148
This is Kamo Rosu...
roast duck.

14:41.214 --> 14:44.084
Mm. I'd say well done, Tana,

14:44.151 --> 14:45.718
but the meat's too damn tender.

15:04.337 --> 15:07.040
Does he have to be so perfect?

15:08.375 --> 15:09.376
Mm?

15:09.442 --> 15:10.510
Tana.

15:10.577 --> 15:11.878
He never stops moving,

15:11.979 --> 15:14.014
except for that damn flute.

15:14.081 --> 15:16.984
Uh, Tana's a wonder.

15:17.050 --> 15:19.786
We should have hired him
the minute we got here.

15:19.852 --> 15:22.022
You said it yourself.

15:22.089 --> 15:23.990
You don't want
to cook and clean.

15:23.991 --> 15:26.293
No. I don't. But...

15:27.627 --> 15:29.662
what am I supposed to do?

15:31.231 --> 15:33.166
Whatever you like.

15:33.233 --> 15:35.335
You're the lady of the house.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.238
Lady of leisure.

15:49.016 --> 15:51.184
My apologies, Maryann.

15:51.251 --> 15:54.287
I've been remiss in inviting
our neighbors to call.

15:54.354 --> 15:55.488
I'm a little at the mercy

15:55.555 --> 15:57.490
of my husband's
writing schedule.

15:57.557 --> 16:00.227
You must be quite
proud of his success.

16:00.293 --> 16:01.928
Oh.

16:02.029 --> 16:04.064
Thank you, Tana.
That'll be all.

16:05.232 --> 16:07.600
Yes. I'm very proud.

16:07.667 --> 16:11.671
Scott's talents have been
nothing but a blessing to me.

16:14.207 --> 16:16.176
Perhaps next time
our husbands can join us.

16:16.243 --> 16:18.111
I don't have a husband.

16:19.179 --> 16:22.048
Never have.
I've never been married.

16:22.049 --> 16:24.751
I'm sorry. I...
I just assumed.

16:24.817 --> 16:27.887
Everybody does.
I'm a rare breed.

16:27.954 --> 16:29.522
Never found a man
who could tolerate

16:29.589 --> 16:32.925
how often my hands
are covered in clay.

16:33.060 --> 16:34.327
Speaking of...

16:38.631 --> 16:40.100
For your new home.

16:40.167 --> 16:42.735
Oh. Thank you, Maryann.

16:42.802 --> 16:44.604
That's wonderful.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.073
You're an artist.

16:46.139 --> 16:47.474
I wouldn't say that.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.642
It's just what I do.

18:00.847 --> 18:02.382
This is all you have?

18:04.917 --> 18:06.286
- Zelda.
- This whole time

18:06.353 --> 18:07.663
when you've been
locked away in here?

18:07.687 --> 18:08.721
Where's my...

18:08.788 --> 18:10.523
Where's your novel?

18:10.590 --> 18:12.559
There's not even an end
to a beginning here.

18:12.625 --> 18:15.662
I... I didn't say that you
could come in here.

18:15.728 --> 18:18.198
Well, maybe if I'd been
delivering a duck dinner.

18:18.265 --> 18:21.067
I told you that I
needed to be alone,

18:21.168 --> 18:23.936
and yet here you are
judging my...

18:24.003 --> 18:26.005
my pace, my process.

18:26.072 --> 18:27.712
You just don't stumble
into beauty, Zelda.

18:27.740 --> 18:30.076
It takes Herculean
focus and effort.

18:30.177 --> 18:31.211
And gin.

18:31.278 --> 18:33.179
There are more empty
bottles in here

18:33.180 --> 18:34.947
- than you have pages.
- You know what...

18:35.014 --> 18:37.217
what I do is very different

18:37.284 --> 18:41.020
from the automatic writing
that you do in your diary.

18:41.087 --> 18:42.855
How dare you.

18:42.922 --> 18:45.091
These are not random.

18:45.192 --> 18:46.926
These are my thoughts
and dreams.

18:46.993 --> 18:50.363
You told me you thought
my writing was beautiful.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.599
I'm sorry I interrupted
your process.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.834
Well, for your information,

18:54.901 --> 18:58.004
I have written
three stories already,

18:58.070 --> 18:59.339
but I have to do both.

18:59.406 --> 19:02.208
Max wants the new novel
by September,

19:02.209 --> 19:04.277
and he's not going to
give me another advance.

19:04.344 --> 19:06.979
So without the stories,
how do we afford this house?

19:07.046 --> 19:08.281
How do we afford anything?

19:08.348 --> 19:10.250
You think that that
just appeared

19:10.317 --> 19:12.652
on your wrist by magic?

19:14.321 --> 19:17.824
I don't want this,
you horse's ass.

19:18.958 --> 19:20.227
I want you!

19:21.494 --> 19:23.796
What, do you not
need me anymore?

19:23.863 --> 19:25.465
Of course I do.

19:32.505 --> 19:33.706
Okay.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.145
Okay, how about this?

19:39.246 --> 19:41.514
We have a few friends
over for the weekend.

19:41.581 --> 19:43.916
We tear things up a little.

19:43.983 --> 19:45.418
I can write in between.

19:45.485 --> 19:47.253
We'll bring the city
to Westport.

19:47.254 --> 19:48.921
How's that sound?

19:52.759 --> 19:53.960
You're right.

19:55.262 --> 19:57.029
It's people that we need,

19:57.096 --> 19:58.765
both of us.

20:27.360 --> 20:28.961
Higher, Bunny.

20:29.028 --> 20:30.563
I thought you preferred lower.

20:35.435 --> 20:36.736
Faster, sister.

20:36.803 --> 20:39.238
- Careful now.
- Jump, BG, jump. Oh.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.942
- Try again.
- Okay.

20:43.009 --> 20:44.311
All right.

20:53.953 --> 20:55.622
You inspire me, my dear.

21:01.628 --> 21:07.534
♫ Cuddle up a little
closer, lovey mine ♫

21:07.600 --> 21:12.839
♫ Cuddle up and be
my little clinging vine ♫

21:12.905 --> 21:15.975
♫ Love to be
your cheeks so rosy ♫

21:16.042 --> 21:19.078
♫ Love to make you
comfy-cozy ♫

21:19.145 --> 21:22.214
♫ 'cause I love you
head to toesie ♫

21:22.349 --> 21:24.917
♫ Lovey mine ♫

21:26.519 --> 21:28.688
Bravo, Tom, bravo.

21:28.755 --> 21:31.591
Oh, come on, Zelda.
You never stop at one.

21:31.658 --> 21:33.393
I haven't stopped so far.

21:38.097 --> 21:39.365
There, darling.

21:39.366 --> 21:40.433
You're cured.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.902
Cured? Was I sick?

21:42.969 --> 21:45.071
- No, no, no. I didn't mean...
- Scott.

21:45.137 --> 21:46.373
- Zelda.
- Hi, Max.

21:46.439 --> 21:48.808
Max. Ha ha.

21:48.875 --> 21:51.143
Out from behind
your mahogany desk.

21:51.210 --> 21:52.244
There's a first.

21:52.379 --> 21:53.946
Well, you did invite me.

21:54.013 --> 21:55.748
Yes, I did.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.684
Ah, Greeks bearing gifts, eh?

21:57.750 --> 21:59.386
No, no. Nothing clandestine.

21:59.452 --> 22:01.087
I'm just here as a guest.

22:01.153 --> 22:02.589
- Hmm.
- Of course,

22:02.655 --> 22:03.823
if you do have some pages,

22:03.890 --> 22:05.291
I'd love to take a look at them.

22:05.392 --> 22:07.960
Ha ha. Of course.

22:08.027 --> 22:09.395
Yes, follow me.

22:09.396 --> 22:11.664
I'll take you to
the inner sanctum.

22:27.480 --> 22:28.681
All right.

22:31.651 --> 22:33.486
Well, as you can see,

22:33.553 --> 22:35.722
nose to the grindstone.

22:35.788 --> 22:37.757
Awfully small grindstone.

22:37.824 --> 22:40.427
Oh, it's quality, not quantity.

22:41.428 --> 22:42.962
Oh, it's too unrefined

22:43.029 --> 22:43.930
for the naked eye,

22:43.996 --> 22:46.933
even one as well practiced
as yours.

22:46.999 --> 22:48.735
Please, sit.

22:53.606 --> 22:56.776
I'm on to something quite
spectacular, though.

22:56.843 --> 22:58.878
I don't mean to denigrate
my previous work,

22:58.945 --> 23:04.617
but this novel will
put Paradise to shame.

23:04.684 --> 23:07.854
Well, you do set the bar high.

23:12.625 --> 23:14.360
And I've been drawing

23:14.461 --> 23:17.029
tremendous inspiration
from Zelda.

23:17.096 --> 23:18.130
Is that so?

23:18.197 --> 23:19.466
Yes.

23:20.332 --> 23:22.935
By all means, take a look.

23:43.490 --> 23:46.125
Zelda, you throw
one hell of a party.

23:46.192 --> 23:47.494
One aims to please.

23:47.527 --> 23:49.762
It's your true calling, my dear.

23:51.230 --> 23:52.632
That's not yours.

23:54.233 --> 23:55.602
Look at that. See?

23:55.668 --> 23:56.969
- Shall we?
- Take a look.

23:57.036 --> 23:58.137
We shall.

24:41.581 --> 24:45.117
Oh, well, ladies,
may we join you?

24:45.184 --> 24:47.319
Get in line, boys.
Sister.

24:47.386 --> 24:48.855
Age before beauty.

24:48.921 --> 24:51.257
Keep telling yourself that.

24:58.565 --> 25:00.166
Scott.

25:00.232 --> 25:01.734
Vincent.

25:01.801 --> 25:03.570
You look like you've
got a bit of sun.

25:03.636 --> 25:05.672
And then some.

25:05.738 --> 25:09.241
I'm impressed you got
so many of us out this far.

25:09.308 --> 25:11.377
- Ah.
- It's quite the quota.

25:11.443 --> 25:13.379
Actors, authors.

25:13.445 --> 25:14.714
- Poets.
- Hmm.

25:14.781 --> 25:16.482
So tell me, Scott,

25:16.583 --> 25:20.186
what exactly does your wife do?

25:20.252 --> 25:21.888
- Zelda?
- Mm.

25:21.954 --> 25:23.589
Well, uh,

25:23.590 --> 25:26.025
she loves me. She's Zelda.

25:26.092 --> 25:28.194
She doesn't have to do anything.

25:28.260 --> 25:29.261
Hmm.

25:53.452 --> 25:56.322
Ah, Zelda, there you are.

25:57.624 --> 25:58.858
Whoo.

25:59.926 --> 26:00.793
My God,

26:00.860 --> 26:02.629
is it only Saturday?

26:04.396 --> 26:06.632
- Scott...
- Fitzgeralds,

26:06.633 --> 26:09.468
I really must be going.

26:09.535 --> 26:10.903
Zelda, my dear,

26:10.970 --> 26:13.973
you have quite a presence
on the page.

26:14.040 --> 26:15.041
I spent hours

26:15.107 --> 26:16.108
with your book.

26:16.175 --> 26:17.175
My book?

26:17.209 --> 26:18.510
I hope you don't mind.

26:18.645 --> 26:21.313
An author and his editor
have no secrets.

26:21.380 --> 26:22.682
Of course not.

26:22.749 --> 26:24.450
Quite engaging prose.

26:24.516 --> 26:27.119
Yes. Now you can see
how she inspires.

26:27.186 --> 26:30.256
Yes. Yes.
Your Zelda has a voice.

26:30.322 --> 26:31.658
Really?

26:31.691 --> 26:33.425
Hell, I could see publishing it

26:33.492 --> 26:34.827
in its own right.

26:34.894 --> 26:36.729
Diary Of a Popular Girl.

26:36.796 --> 26:38.665
That has a ring to it,
eh, Zelda?

26:38.731 --> 26:40.066
Yes, it does.

26:40.132 --> 26:41.233
Don't you think?

26:42.935 --> 26:44.203
No.

26:44.270 --> 26:46.305
No. Uh...

26:46.372 --> 26:48.708
I mean, it's wonderful,

26:48.775 --> 26:49.876
but... but, darling,

26:49.942 --> 26:53.179
this... this truly
is my inspiration.

26:53.245 --> 26:54.914
It's also my life.

26:54.981 --> 26:57.884
Which I have used already
and to great effect.

26:57.950 --> 27:00.086
Yes, I know you have.
Some of it...

27:00.152 --> 27:02.354
Certainly not worth
squabbling over.

27:02.421 --> 27:03.956
Two wordsmiths under one roof.

27:04.023 --> 27:05.958
- What could be better?
- My point is

27:06.025 --> 27:08.928
we both stand to benefit
far more financially

27:08.995 --> 27:10.462
is I were to use that diary

27:10.529 --> 27:12.765
than if you were to publish
it under your own name.

27:14.300 --> 27:17.036
This is how it's always
been with us, Zelda,

27:17.103 --> 27:18.705
and you've always lived that.

27:18.738 --> 27:20.406
This is the way that we work.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.975
Our sum total is
greater than our parts.

27:23.042 --> 27:25.211
What part am I,
and what part are you?

27:27.013 --> 27:28.013
Ohh.

27:34.453 --> 27:36.789
- Zelda.
- Hello, baby.
