00:18.599 --> 00:23.011
There is no God!

00:35.282 --> 00:37.359
Forgive me.

00:42.247 --> 00:44.785
Give me a sign.

00:45.208 --> 00:46.915
Help me.

00:51.254 --> 00:54.919
Maureen. Maureen, where are you, dear?

00:55.342 --> 00:57.666
Maureen, where are you?

00:58.093 --> 01:00.337
Oh dear God. She's up there.

01:00.765 --> 01:02.555
Maureen!

01:02.974 --> 01:04.968
Stay where you are!

01:05.394 --> 01:07.102
Don't move!

01:08.896 --> 01:12.681
Stay where you are.
- Come down!

01:14.778 --> 01:17.149
There is no God!

01:17.571 --> 01:20.324
Wretched girl, how dare you!
- Get away from me!

01:20.742 --> 01:22.650
Please, Maureen. You mustn't.

01:23.077 --> 01:27.075
You have an obligation to Him.
- I have nothing.

01:27.499 --> 01:32.125
I am nothing.
- You can't. - No!

01:43.470 --> 01:46.887
Wasn't your own sin red enough?
You'll burn in hell for this!

01:47.308 --> 01:49.716
You'll burn in hell!

01:52.023 --> 01:53.481
Maureen!

03:50.468 --> 03:54.382
Want a ride? Or do you have
the Olympic torch in the suitcase?

03:58.600 --> 04:01.055
Wouldn't want to lose ya.

04:01.686 --> 04:04.436
Oon't worry.
I ain't born again or nothing.

04:04.855 --> 04:08.190
I'll get this junk out of your way.

04:08.610 --> 04:11.102
Jesus just come with it
when I bought her used.

04:11.531 --> 04:15.444
I wanted to replace it
with a magnetic compass,

04:15.868 --> 04:18.572
but you usually end up
going the wrong direction anyway.

04:18.995 --> 04:21.747
That makes two of us.
- Yeah?

04:26.126 --> 04:28.831
Water?
- Thank you.

04:30.337 --> 04:33.543
Name's Ouane Ouke, by the way.
Friends just call me Ouke.

04:36.971 --> 04:41.679
Put the suitcase in the back seat.
- Thank you.

04:43.185 --> 04:45.261
Hey, watch the guitar!
- I'm sorry.

04:45.688 --> 04:50.147
No harm done.
Just watch out. It's my life.

04:50.566 --> 04:55.193
Going to LA to be a rock-n-roll star.
What about you? Where you going?

04:55.613 --> 04:58.781
What were you doing back there?
- I...

04:59.202 --> 05:03.244
Car trouble?
- Yes. I had car trouble.

05:03.663 --> 05:05.157
What kind?

05:07.542 --> 05:13.660
Ah, no car.
- No car? That's the worst kind.

05:14.088 --> 05:17.421
Still don't know where you come from.
- So?

05:17.842 --> 05:21.887
Are you my Father confessor?
- Jesus,

05:22.305 --> 05:26.767
I was just asking! You act as if
I accused you of murder or something.

05:27.394 --> 05:31.724
Hey, it's none of my business.
Play mystery lady if you want.

05:32.149 --> 05:36.811
I don't care where you come from.
Could've fallen from the sky.

05:37.236 --> 05:40.236
A little angel
just tumbled off her cloud.

05:40.655 --> 05:45.032
Well, hold on angel,
I'll get you where you're going.

06:00.176 --> 06:02.049
Get out of here!

06:12.561 --> 06:14.553
Come on, baby.

06:23.113 --> 06:25.355
You alright?
- Yes.

06:46.344 --> 06:49.380
What are you doing? - It's as
far as we go in this shit, honey.

06:49.805 --> 06:53.804
But it could rain all night.
- That's right.

06:57.104 --> 06:59.096
Better get some sleep.

07:52.324 --> 07:55.573
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

07:58.120 --> 08:00.528
You kind of slid over.

08:00.956 --> 08:03.162
It's still raining.

08:05.838 --> 08:09.121
Why did you do that?
- Why didn't you stop me?

08:09.548 --> 08:13.083
I didn't have time.
- I'll give you another chance.

08:14.219 --> 08:18.928
I'm not very good at this.
- You could have fooled me.

08:20.684 --> 08:22.308
Please don't!

08:27.481 --> 08:30.647
Oh, well, I guess
we got him a little excited.

08:32.113 --> 08:33.309
Oon't!

08:34.239 --> 08:35.318
No!

08:37.616 --> 08:40.452
What's the problem, angel?

08:41.453 --> 08:43.493
Get away from me!

08:49.126 --> 08:53.707
Are you crazy? Get in here!
- Give me my suitcase.

08:59.014 --> 09:00.211
Stupid bitch!

09:00.639 --> 09:03.889
You could've been coming
instead of going.

11:47.255 --> 11:50.754
Are you really my mother?
- The name Spool means nothing to you?

11:51.177 --> 11:54.759
No. Should it?
- It was Norma Bates' maiden name.

11:55.180 --> 11:57.635
The woman you thought was
your mother was my sister.

11:58.057 --> 12:01.473
She never mentioned me, did she?
- No.

12:01.894 --> 12:04.349
You sure you won't have a sandwich?

12:05.525 --> 12:07.315
Pardon?

13:24.850 --> 13:26.094
Hi there.

13:29.144 --> 13:31.019
Be right down.

13:58.924 --> 14:00.086
Room?

14:02.510 --> 14:05.344
I'd love one,
but I don't think I can afford it.

14:05.762 --> 14:08.798
You should keep the register closed.
Somebody'll steal you blind.

14:09.223 --> 14:12.094
Wouldn't get them very far.
- Business slow?

14:12.519 --> 14:17.346
You're my first customer of the day.
Or did you just need directions?

14:17.776 --> 14:21.854
I was actually interested in the sign.
But if business is bad...

14:22.279 --> 14:25.944
No, it's not bad, just slow.

14:29.161 --> 14:33.073
Well, 12 cabins, 12 vacancies...
We've been closed for a while.

14:33.497 --> 14:36.451
Renovations.
But life's picking up along here.

14:36.875 --> 14:38.784
Good prices, good service.
Things'll pick up.

14:39.211 --> 14:42.793
I've got a rebuilt ice machine,
and 4 cabins booked for this week.

14:43.547 --> 14:47.084
Fairvale High's Homecoming.
Big game against Central.

14:48.095 --> 14:51.465
I'm rattling on.
Yes, there is a job. Interested?

14:51.891 --> 14:56.138
In money? The only honest way
to get it is to earn it or inherit it.

14:56.562 --> 15:00.095
And I don't have any rich relatives.
Got an application form?

15:00.524 --> 15:03.061
Not necessary. My name is Norman,

15:03.484 --> 15:05.441
Norman Bates.

15:06.946 --> 15:09.898
What'ya been painting?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

15:10.323 --> 15:15.069
Step into the back while I clean up.
- Said the spider to the fly.

15:21.544 --> 15:25.623
Local branch of the Audubon society?
- My hobby. Stuffing things.

15:26.047 --> 15:30.341
Have a seat...
- Ouane Ouke. Just call me Ouke.

15:30.969 --> 15:33.009
I can pay you 5 dollars an hour.

15:33.430 --> 15:37.177
You'd work the desk,
make beds, clean up. Stuff like that.

15:39.812 --> 15:43.346
Want some of these?
You'd be general assistant.

15:43.774 --> 15:47.391
Work's not too hard,
and you'd have lots of free time.

15:48.153 --> 15:52.148
I'm the manager,
so you'd be assistant manager.

15:52.572 --> 15:57.364
You'd get a free room and work days.
I prefer the nights.

15:57.785 --> 15:59.827
I've got to be honest, Norm.
- Norman.

16:00.247 --> 16:03.828
I just want to make enough bucks
to get my car fixed and

16:04.253 --> 16:07.621
build up a little stake for LA.
I'm a singer.

16:09.339 --> 16:13.384
But I could fill in until you found
somebody permanent. I'm just not

16:13.802 --> 16:15.345
staying too long.

16:17.430 --> 16:20.217
No one ever does.

16:21.558 --> 16:24.429
Your cabin's at the end.
Why don't you go unpack?

16:24.853 --> 16:27.807
I need to get back to the house.

16:29.190 --> 16:32.027
You live up there?
- Yeah.

16:32.820 --> 16:34.729
Me and myself, alone.

16:41.454 --> 16:45.450
You clear on the credit card machine?
- Yeah, I used to be a pump jockey.

16:45.873 --> 16:50.001
The rooms cost...
- 20.95 single, 25.95 double.

16:50.419 --> 16:53.753
I'll bring you a couple of burgers.
- Alright!

16:58.720 --> 17:03.014
Still beats the hell out of me.
Just doesn't show up for work one day.

17:03.474 --> 17:07.305
Thought you would've turned up
some clues by now, John.

17:07.728 --> 17:12.935
Her apartment's all in order.
Oidn't say anything to her landlord.

17:13.358 --> 17:17.438
You'd think she'd tell me
if she was going to take a month off.

17:17.862 --> 17:19.819
Emma Spool
was as regular as clockwork.

17:20.240 --> 17:23.690
I don't think she missed a day
in the? years I've owned this dump.

17:24.119 --> 17:29.113
I hope that nothing's happened to her.
- You mean like Norman Bates?

17:30.083 --> 17:35.078
Oidn't they work here together?
They say he likes older women.

17:35.797 --> 17:39.460
Rumors and innuendo caused
that boy enough trouble.

17:39.882 --> 17:43.334
What's your interest anyway?
- I drove from LA to see him.

17:43.761 --> 17:46.882
Why? You another relative
of somebody he killed?

17:47.307 --> 17:49.762
It's really not any of your business.

17:50.184 --> 17:52.013
Keeping the peace is my business.

17:52.438 --> 17:55.723
Then until I've broken some law,
lay off the third-degree, OK?

17:56.150 --> 17:58.723
Can't you just leave
the poor slob alone?

17:59.153 --> 18:04.395
What are you? His fan club?
- No, we believe in second chances.

18:04.824 --> 18:07.944
What Norman did was a long time ago,
and he paid the price.

18:08.368 --> 18:10.361
It depends on who you ask.

18:10.787 --> 18:13.788
20 years in the bunk house
is paying the price, girly.

18:14.207 --> 18:15.832
The guy's okay now.

18:16.250 --> 18:19.455
When he worked here,
he was always on time and reliable.

18:19.880 --> 18:22.087
A real Employee of the Month!

18:22.843 --> 18:28.133
Go ahead and talk smart, lady.
He just wants to be left in peace.

18:28.556 --> 18:35.007
Now look, Norman Bates has suffered
enough. Just leave him...

18:36.437 --> 18:38.560
Afternoon, sheriff.
- ... alone.

18:38.982 --> 18:41.650
Mrs. Oudley...
- What'll it be, Norman?

18:42.775 --> 18:45.268
Chicken fried steak is good today.

18:45.697 --> 18:49.908
Alright, and a glass of milk, please.
And a couple of burgers to go.

18:50.326 --> 18:52.698
I'm warning you. I don't want trouble.

18:53.121 --> 18:57.367
Then let go of my arm
or I'll holler police brutality.

18:59.167 --> 19:03.710
Mind if I join you, Mr. Bates?
Tracy Vanderbilt.

19:06.175 --> 19:08.001
Thanks, Myrna.

19:09.426 --> 19:11.801
Coastal Reports?
- I write for them sometimes.

19:12.222 --> 19:15.590
If you don't mind, I'd like to ask you
a few questions. - I mind.

19:16.018 --> 19:19.636
Mr. Bates... - Norman.
- I'm writing on the insanity defense

19:20.062 --> 19:22.814
and the rehabilitation
of mentally ill murderers.

19:23.232 --> 19:27.312
Many people think
they can't be rehabilitated

19:27.736 --> 19:30.024
and there shouldn't be
an insanity defense.

19:30.446 --> 19:35.654
We hear the objections of the victims
and relatives, but the murderers,

19:36.077 --> 19:41.664
who can't help themselves,
are victims too. What do you think?

19:42.083 --> 19:44.920
If this lady's bothering you,
I'll have her leave.

19:45.588 --> 19:48.043
Isn't your coffee break over, sheriff?

19:52.217 --> 19:54.258
Anything else, Norman?

19:55.762 --> 19:59.346
What do you think?
- About? - What we were just saying.

19:59.767 --> 20:04.097
You were incarcerated for 20 years.
- 22.

20:04.564 --> 20:08.431
Right.
For 22 years, you were locked away.

20:08.859 --> 20:11.398
The state says you're sane.
You paid your debt.

20:11.821 --> 20:15.071
Then Lila Loomis starts
to persecute you. - Because of

20:15.492 --> 20:17.448
what happened to her sister.
- Yes.

20:17.868 --> 20:20.074
Marion Crane. Right?

20:28.210 --> 20:31.379
Right.
- But that was 20 years ago.

20:31.798 --> 20:33.173
22.

20:33.591 --> 20:36.378
A long time to harbor revenge.

20:36.803 --> 20:41.049
Aren't you bitter about
what Lila Loomis tried to do to you?

20:42.350 --> 20:43.594
I understand.

20:44.018 --> 20:46.591
My cure
couldn't cure the hurt I caused.

20:47.021 --> 20:50.305
My return to sanity
didn't return the dead.

20:50.732 --> 20:52.772
There's no way
to make up that loss.

20:53.193 --> 20:55.979
The past is never really past.

20:56.403 --> 21:00.106
It stays with me all the time.
No matter how hard I try,

21:00.534 --> 21:05.077
I can't escape. It's always there.
Throbbing inside you.

21:05.497 --> 21:09.825
Coloring your perceptions of the world,
and sometimes controlling them.

21:10.251 --> 21:12.159
That's my point, Norman. You have

21:12.585 --> 21:15.456
a conscience. You live with guilt.
You punish yourself all the time.

21:16.631 --> 21:18.755
Why does the rest of society have to?

21:19.176 --> 21:22.923
Take Mrs. Spool's disappearance.
What if a well-meaning citizen

21:23.346 --> 21:25.886
thought that
you had something to do with it?

21:33.398 --> 21:36.269
I'm not upsetting you, Norman?
All this talk

21:36.693 --> 21:39.064
is only hypothetical.
- What's yours, babe?

21:39.486 --> 21:42.937
She is only an example
of how people might,

21:43.365 --> 21:45.275
given your past history,

21:45.868 --> 21:50.412
tend to automatically blame you
for any murder in the area.

22:11.350 --> 22:14.470
You're not going, Norman?
I'd like to talk to you again.

22:16.396 --> 22:19.268
You're not going to stiff us, Norman?

22:20.902 --> 22:25.694
Excuse me. Could you tell me,
is there a cheap place to stay here?

23:47.109 --> 23:48.391
Hello, angel.

23:49.778 --> 23:51.356
You work here?

23:51.779 --> 23:54.614
It's called suffering for one's art.
I'm sorry about last night.

23:55.032 --> 23:57.784
I was a little road-weary.
I'm glad you didn't drown.

23:58.203 --> 23:59.577
I'm so very tired.

23:59.996 --> 24:02.912
You won't find another place close.

24:03.960 --> 24:09.297
Oon't worry. Aside from total boredom,
nothing will happen to you here.

24:22.476 --> 24:25.810
Maureen Coil. Pretty name.

24:26.438 --> 24:30.354
How much?
- For a single, $25.95.

24:43.246 --> 24:45.735
There you go, angel.
Enjoy your stay.

25:11.231 --> 25:15.179
Your type, Norm?
- You gave her Cabin 1.

25:15.901 --> 25:18.393
Makes it kind of cosy.

25:18.988 --> 25:22.687
Clean her up a little,
she'll look pretty good.

25:37.798 --> 25:41.925
Put me closer to the window.
- Someone will see you, Mother.

25:42.343 --> 25:44.632
Are you ashamed of me?

25:45.055 --> 25:48.553
You know why, Mother. They've
even written about you in the paper.

25:48.973 --> 25:52.925
Stop your whining, boy.
All this fuss over nothing.

25:53.772 --> 25:56.227
Not nothing. I saw her.

25:56.650 --> 26:01.358
Even the initials on the suitcase.
M.C., Marion Crane.

26:01.779 --> 26:06.821
Another of your cheap,
erotic delusions.

26:07.243 --> 26:11.026
You killed her.
The slut deserved it. But she's dead.

26:11.455 --> 26:13.577
And the dead don't come back.

26:15.041 --> 26:17.795
You came back.
- I never went away.

26:18.212 --> 26:22.921
Oon't you know that by now?
You can't get rid of me.

26:23.634 --> 26:25.959
I'll always be with you, Norman.

26:26.677 --> 26:28.221
Always.

26:28.930 --> 26:31.680
Stand up straight and
wipe your snotty little nose.

26:32.098 --> 26:37.555
If the disgusting little whore upsets
you so much, just get rid of her.

26:37.979 --> 26:38.977
No!

26:43.234 --> 26:45.988
Then maybe I will.

27:08.008 --> 27:12.172
You have an obligation, Maureen.
Maureen, don't!

27:12.597 --> 27:14.755
There is no God.

27:15.183 --> 27:20.473
Please Maureen, you mustn't.
Get away. You'll burn in hell.

27:20.897 --> 27:24.893
You have an obligation.
I have nothing.

27:25.316 --> 27:28.234
I am nothing.

27:54.553 --> 27:57.304
What'll it be?
- Give me a beer.

28:10.819 --> 28:11.815
Hi.

28:13.529 --> 28:16.234
I'm Ouane.
- No kidding?

28:20.202 --> 28:23.535
Any objections
to a guy buying you a drink?

28:23.955 --> 28:27.574
I got a drink.
- So have another.

28:28.002 --> 28:30.791
You got a limit?
- Only to my patience.

28:31.214 --> 28:34.914
You don't have to call me Ouane.
- No, I don't. - Friends call me Ouke.

28:35.343 --> 28:37.300
I had a dog named Ouke once.
- Really?

28:37.720 --> 28:42.346
Scratch my belly, my leg'll shake.
- I hated the mutt.

28:47.145 --> 28:50.727
Keep the matches, lady. You need 'em.
You're as warm as a cry for help.

28:52.733 --> 28:55.567
Just a minute. Ouke. Ah, Ouane.

28:56.989 --> 29:00.024
Whatever. I'm easy.
- I've noticed.

29:00.450 --> 29:02.858
You staying there?
- Working there.

29:03.662 --> 29:05.453
Even better.

29:05.913 --> 29:09.412
Let's sit down. I'll buy.

29:37.610 --> 29:39.817
Help.

29:54.459 --> 29:56.287
Help me!

30:58.937 --> 31:02.222
Miserere mei, Oeus.

31:03.232 --> 31:07.775
Miserere mei, Oeus.

32:26.061 --> 32:28.054
Forgive me.

32:35.739 --> 32:39.688
I figured Bates was a geek.
But a full-fledged loony tune?

32:40.117 --> 32:44.743
You think he offed this Spool broad?
- Well, he acted pretty weird.

32:45.163 --> 32:49.207
But then he's pretty a weird guy.
- No shit.

32:49.626 --> 32:53.374
So you'll pay me for...
- Anything I can use. - How about:

32:53.796 --> 32:56.965
A girl checked in this afternoon.
Nice looker, too. When Norman saw her,

32:57.385 --> 33:00.550
he kind of freaked.
Strolling down memory lane.

33:05.225 --> 33:07.467
Are you leaving so soon?
- I'm afraid so.

33:07.894 --> 33:11.558
Oon't you want to work this off
in trade? I'll credit your account.

33:11.980 --> 33:14.851
You shouldn't rely so much
on that face and those pearly whites,

33:15.275 --> 33:20.151
because come-ons like that
could get them punched out.

33:33.502 --> 33:35.660
Forgive me.

33:37.130 --> 33:40.213
You're alright.
You're in St. Matthew's Hospital.

33:43.218 --> 33:46.884
I'm Father Brian.
I'm the resident psychiatrist.

33:50.436 --> 33:53.270
Maureen,
do you know who saved you?

33:55.482 --> 33:56.596
Mary.

34:01.486 --> 34:04.403
I'm sure she had a hand in it.
But there was someone else.

34:04.822 --> 34:08.273
You ought to be real proud, Norman.
- Yes, it was very heroic.

34:08.701 --> 34:11.868
How do you happen to be here?
- Just my dumb luck.

34:12.288 --> 34:16.583
I saw the ambulance leaving the motel
and wanted to see what was up.

34:17.002 --> 34:20.416
Must've been disappointing for you.
- How did Norman find out?

34:20.838 --> 34:24.706
Towels. - Towels.
- Yes, he took her some fresh towels.

34:25.135 --> 34:30.176
Now I do know my job, Ms. Vanderbilt.
- Mr. Bates, she wants to see you.

34:34.059 --> 34:38.271
I wouldn't pick out a silverware
pattern just yet, sheriff.

34:48.907 --> 34:52.655
You found me, Mr. Bates.

34:53.327 --> 34:54.525
Norman.

34:55.538 --> 34:57.945
My name's Maureen.

35:00.918 --> 35:04.370
I just wanted to thank you
for what you did.

35:04.797 --> 35:09.626
I can't have that going on
in my motel. It gives it a bad name.

35:10.054 --> 35:15.391
Please don't take it the wrong way,
Marion. I'm sorry, I mean, Maureen.

35:16.017 --> 35:19.847
I'm sorry.
- I did leave the bathroom a mess.

35:20.813 --> 35:23.481
I've seen it worse.
- I'm sorry.

35:23.898 --> 35:26.057
I'm sorry to be such a bother.

35:26.484 --> 35:29.484
Oh, you're no bother.
No bother at all.

35:29.903 --> 35:33.024
People should look out
for each other, don't you think?

35:33.449 --> 35:37.779
Sometimes we get lost.
But if there'd only been someone

35:38.205 --> 35:41.620
to help us understand,
then maybe we wouldn't do

35:42.042 --> 35:44.497
some of the sad, awful things we do.

35:45.419 --> 35:47.294
You're very kind.

35:50.048 --> 35:51.589
You should rest.

35:53.010 --> 35:56.627
Oo you have somewhere to go
when you get out?

35:57.430 --> 36:01.094
If you want, you can stay
at the motel until you're better.

36:01.516 --> 36:05.895
FOC, of course. Free of charge.
As long as you like. It's never full.

36:06.314 --> 36:09.316
It would give you
a chance to sort things out.

36:09.818 --> 36:11.728
Why are you so kind to me?

36:13.363 --> 36:17.655
You remind me of someone I knew once.

36:18.366 --> 36:22.494
You don't know me.
After the way you found me,

36:22.912 --> 36:26.115
you must think I'm mad.
- No, no.

36:31.171 --> 36:34.088
We all go a little mad, sometimes.

36:34.507 --> 36:38.173
But sometimes...

36:40.097 --> 36:44.389
the despair is just so overwhelming,

36:44.808 --> 36:48.260
that all you want is for it to stop.

36:51.065 --> 36:56.108
I'd like to stay at your motel
for a few days, if you don't mind.

36:58.114 --> 37:01.447
I'm glad you're safe.
- Thank you.

37:03.035 --> 37:06.035
Thank you for looking out for me.

37:07.748 --> 37:09.289
Sure.

37:27.641 --> 37:31.177
You were down there, Mother.
Weren't you?

37:32.104 --> 37:35.021
I'm glad she didn't die. I'm glad.

37:36.066 --> 37:38.058
She will.

37:39.111 --> 37:43.403
Oon't you touch her. Never!

37:43.823 --> 37:47.108
Be quiet or someone will hear us.
- Let them.

37:47.867 --> 37:52.365
Let them hear.
- They sure like the TV up loud.

38:24.529 --> 38:26.736
I'm sorry.

38:27.324 --> 38:29.281
Are you okay?
- Yeah.

38:29.701 --> 38:32.785
I usually keep this locked
when no one's here.

38:38.418 --> 38:42.248
Mommy's little helper. Very sweet.

38:44.507 --> 38:46.545
You always watch TV so loud?

38:49.929 --> 38:52.882
Oh, the TV, yeah.

38:55.600 --> 38:56.763
Who are you?

38:57.184 --> 39:00.635
A friend of Ouke's?
- We're getting to know each other.

39:03.482 --> 39:07.017
Why don't you come and
join our party?

39:09.866 --> 39:12.356
Oh, no. No, thanks.

39:13.534 --> 39:16.489
Too bad. Thanks for looking after me.

39:16.913 --> 39:18.952
See you around, maybe.

39:20.208 --> 39:21.749
Oh my God.

39:27.672 --> 39:29.166
Maybe!

40:51.462 --> 40:52.836
Hey,

40:54.379 --> 40:56.955
watch the guitar.

41:25.118 --> 41:29.615
Oh God, don't tell me you're of those
who farts, rolls over and sleeps.

41:30.040 --> 41:33.575
I picked you up in a bar.
What, you want to get married?

41:34.003 --> 41:36.290
You shithead!

41:36.713 --> 41:40.127
I got to get up for work soon.
Just go home.

41:40.549 --> 41:42.625
How?
You brought me out here.

41:43.051 --> 41:46.135
Here's the cab fare.
Phone book's on the table.

41:46.554 --> 41:51.182
You make it all sound so cheap.
- It is, but it beats a vibrator.

41:51.936 --> 41:55.554
Yeah?
At least a vibrator gets me off.

41:55.981 --> 42:00.026
Use the payphone, bitch.
- Ouch. Let go!

42:09.326 --> 42:13.075
Give me my clothes. Bastard!

42:37.896 --> 42:39.687
You fucking idiot!

43:08.173 --> 43:09.718
Oh shit.

43:23.605 --> 43:25.148
No! Help!

43:47.962 --> 43:51.961
We're unable to complete
your call as dialed.

43:52.384 --> 43:54.672
Please hang up and dial again.

43:56.763 --> 43:59.051
Mother! Oh God, Mother!

43:59.473 --> 44:01.511
Blood, blood!

44:28.250 --> 44:30.328
Up early, huh?

44:45.684 --> 44:51.472
When I was young, my parents
always made all my decisions.

44:52.481 --> 44:55.568
Becoming a nun was my idea.

44:57.696 --> 45:04.364
But as my final vows grew closer,
it became so frightening.

45:04.786 --> 45:07.573
I began to dwell upon things
that I would never know.

45:07.997 --> 45:09.705
What things?

45:10.999 --> 45:12.992
Hungers for the flesh, Father.

45:13.418 --> 45:16.585
It's perfectly normal.

45:17.006 --> 45:19.792
Sister Catherine said
it was bad, and...

45:20.216 --> 45:25.259
if my faith were strong enough,
that I wouldn't have evil thoughts.

45:26.306 --> 45:31.052
Why didn't you just leave the
novitiate rather than be tormented?

45:31.477 --> 45:34.727
But the Church teaches us
to endure suffering.

45:35.148 --> 45:37.555
It also teaches us
that suicide is a sin.

45:37.985 --> 45:40.557
I knew it was wrong, Father.

45:42.780 --> 45:44.689
I was afraid...

45:46.158 --> 45:48.529
to face the consequences of my sins.

45:48.954 --> 45:53.910
Maureen, it seems that only you
have given up on yourself, not God.

45:54.334 --> 45:58.829
Why else would he have twice saved you
from your own desperateness?

45:59.255 --> 46:01.128
The other night,

46:02.716 --> 46:04.541
as I lay there,

46:06.552 --> 46:09.718
I saw the Virgin standing above me.

46:10.808 --> 46:14.388
A halo of white light was about her,

46:14.810 --> 46:19.437
and she held a shiny, silver crucifix.

46:20.191 --> 46:24.272
Her arms were outstretched
as if she were beckoning me.

46:24.695 --> 46:28.278
Oh Father, what did she want of me?

46:30.617 --> 46:35.195
What about this? - Maybe she got
change for the phone or cigarettes.

46:36.038 --> 46:40.451
It might help if you knew her name.
- Forgot to ask.

46:40.875 --> 46:44.496
It usually comes after "Hi, I'm Ouane,
but you can call me Ouke. "

46:44.923 --> 46:49.385
I'm more interested in those voices
you heard up at the house.

46:49.804 --> 46:54.927
Maybe voices.
It could have been a TV or a radio.

46:57.309 --> 47:00.144
Quite a crowd!
- Yeah, homecoming weekend.

47:00.562 --> 47:03.398
They're celebrating the big victory.
The game's not until tonight.

47:03.816 --> 47:07.065
Where are you going? - You said
he's at the hospital picking her up.

47:07.484 --> 47:10.736
Yeah. But what if he comes back?

47:11.157 --> 47:13.647
You don't know a thing.

47:19.415 --> 47:22.997
Fairvale or Central? Come on!
Where are you from? - Fairvale.

47:23.417 --> 47:27.545
Too bad. Hope you don't mind losing.

47:32.635 --> 47:33.914
Ms. Vanderbilt!

47:34.552 --> 47:40.176
After you check in, come down to 4.
There's a party. We gonna beat you.

47:48.525 --> 47:52.439
Ms. Vanderbilt, are you looking
for something? - Just you.

47:52.861 --> 47:56.730
Hoping we can finish our little chat.
- Your chats end up sounding

47:57.158 --> 48:00.692
more like interrogations.
- Another time? - No.

48:01.119 --> 48:04.241
And please, don't come back.

48:18.470 --> 48:21.139
Oh, Norman. How sweet of you.

48:21.556 --> 48:25.719
You had them cleaned.
- They were a little wrinkled and wet.

48:26.227 --> 48:28.218
And a little out of style, too.

48:28.815 --> 48:31.435
Oh, no. Conservative clothes

48:31.858 --> 48:33.650
never go out of style.

48:35.112 --> 48:37.816
I especially like that one.

48:40.326 --> 48:43.360
You'd look swell in that tonight.

48:48.457 --> 48:53.284
I think Mrs. Spool said she had
a son once. But he never visited her.

48:53.711 --> 48:56.916
And she never went anywhere.
- Never went out, huh?

48:57.341 --> 49:00.211
Just work. A real homebody.

49:00.636 --> 49:05.131
I've got a backed-up toilet in 6...
- Mind if I stay and snoop a bit?

49:05.556 --> 49:10.551
Why should I? The cops have already
paraded through here and everything.

49:10.978 --> 49:15.557
You can rent it for all I care.
Spoolie's rent was two weeks past due.

49:15.983 --> 49:19.518
How much for just a couple of hours?
- Thanks...

49:19.945 --> 49:25.153
It's a pleasure to see a woman here
without blue hair and varicose veins.

49:25.577 --> 49:28.696
Yeah.
- Just close the door when you leave.

49:29.122 --> 49:30.746
Sure thing.

50:39.104 --> 50:40.645
Bates Motel.

50:41.397 --> 50:43.972
Hello?

50:44.527 --> 50:46.186
Hello?

51:01.334 --> 51:04.667
I'm going now. I won't be out late.

51:05.087 --> 51:06.285
Mother?

51:10.427 --> 51:12.881
She's a nice girl.

51:36.161 --> 51:39.160
I've never drunk this much before.
- Me neither.

51:39.579 --> 51:43.957
My mother never allowed liquor
at home. - What can we toast to now?

51:44.375 --> 51:45.835
To happiness.

51:50.422 --> 51:55.333
Would you like to dance?
- Oh, no. No. I couldn't.

51:55.760 --> 51:59.923
It's very easy.
My mother taught me. Come on.

52:01.056 --> 52:05.305
I feel woozy.
- It'll make you light on your feet.

52:18.533 --> 52:22.482
Norman, I feel silly.
- Nothing wrong in that.

52:22.912 --> 52:26.031
Just follow me.
I go forward, you go back.

52:26.456 --> 52:30.040
Slow, slow, quick, quick...

52:34.048 --> 52:37.215
See? You just learned
your basic back step.

52:40.012 --> 52:43.594
Slow, slow, quick, quick...

53:14.543 --> 53:19.123
Oh well, they say
the wet-look is coming back.

53:31.644 --> 53:34.894
How's the party going, Ouke?
- It's cool, Norm.

53:35.314 --> 53:39.560
You mind hanging on for a while?
- It's your overtime.

54:23.069 --> 54:24.443
What's wrong?

54:26.447 --> 54:28.772
I must've had too much to drink.

54:29.199 --> 54:32.034
I just thought
I saw a woman in your house.

54:36.123 --> 54:38.909
It's okay, Ouke. You can go now.

54:39.917 --> 54:41.710
Whatever you say, boss.

54:47.467 --> 54:50.468
Sorry, I can't offer you anything
to drink. - That's okay.

54:50.886 --> 54:54.006
Except water.
- That's fine.

54:54.431 --> 54:56.921
They're pretty loud.

55:08.989 --> 55:13.614
I had a very special time tonight.
- Me too.

55:15.911 --> 55:17.285
Thank you.

55:34.971 --> 55:37.378
I should go.

55:38.223 --> 55:41.427
Because of her?
- Who?

55:41.853 --> 55:45.222
That lady you say I remind you of.

55:45.648 --> 55:48.316
Oid she mean a lot to you?

55:51.569 --> 55:53.478
We weren't...

55:53.904 --> 55:56.478
It wasn't...

55:57.699 --> 55:59.857
like it is with you.

56:02.498 --> 56:04.952
How is it with me?

56:29.731 --> 56:31.356
What's wrong?

56:32.525 --> 56:35.277
I'm sorry, Maureen.

56:36.738 --> 56:40.865
I can't do this.
It wouldn't be right.

56:41.658 --> 56:43.365
Not just now.

56:43.784 --> 56:46.157
It wouldn't be right?

56:54.211 --> 56:56.751
Let's just lie here...

56:58.134 --> 57:00.375
and hold each other.

57:28.580 --> 57:33.573
Sorry to wake you, honey, but
you fell asleep with the door open.

57:34.000 --> 57:36.372
With all these horny bastards

57:36.794 --> 57:42.500
running around here, it's not a good
idea. Just wanted to let you know.

57:43.551 --> 57:46.550
Thank you.
- I'll close it on my way out.

57:55.229 --> 57:57.684
You dirty, dirty boy!

57:58.106 --> 58:02.057
But I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything, Mother.

58:02.485 --> 58:05.984
She's a nice girl.
- She's a whore.

58:06.406 --> 58:11.067
We didn't do anything.
- You let her come between us.

58:11.494 --> 58:14.912
It isn't right. It isn't natural.

58:15.333 --> 58:19.031
It's perfectly natural
for a son to love his mother.

58:19.460 --> 58:23.161
Would you leave me alone, Mother!
Will you leave me alone!

59:10.092 --> 59:13.841
Norman,
are you in there? Are you awake?

59:14.264 --> 59:17.632
It's me, Maureen.
- Bring me the knife, Norman.

59:18.977 --> 59:20.256
Norman!

59:20.686 --> 59:24.019
Are you up there?
- Bring it to me.

59:25.439 --> 59:29.485
Oid you hear me? What are you doing?

59:29.903 --> 59:31.562
Can't you do it?

59:35.034 --> 59:37.737
Please answer me. It's Maureen.

59:40.663 --> 59:44.245
What do you want?
- What happened to you?

59:44.666 --> 59:47.204
Are you alright?
- Yes.

59:48.462 --> 59:51.747
No... I'm feeling a little sick.

59:52.173 --> 59:55.091
Let me come up.
- No. Get away!

59:56.804 --> 01:00:01.182
I had a little too much to drink.
That's all. I just need to rest.

01:00:02.643 --> 01:00:04.516
Alright, Norman.

01:00:05.561 --> 01:00:07.021
Please, Maureen,

01:00:07.439 --> 01:00:09.811
go back to your room.

01:00:10.232 --> 01:00:11.941
Lock your door.

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:16.110
Please!
- Alright.

01:00:28.085 --> 01:00:31.001
Stop! Stop!

01:00:34.423 --> 01:00:38.087
You haven't changed in 15 years.
You're still disgusting.

01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:42.966
Ruthie, all cheerleaders
boff the linemen.

01:00:43.388 --> 01:00:48.299
I wasn't a cheerleader.
I was a majorette.

01:00:52.272 --> 01:00:54.097
You can twirl on...

01:00:55.152 --> 01:00:57.309
What?
- You can twirl on my...

01:00:57.736 --> 01:00:58.768
What?

01:00:59.572 --> 01:01:02.063
You can twirl on my baton.

01:01:12.374 --> 01:01:13.952
Hey, cutie.

01:01:15.210 --> 01:01:16.243
Hello?

01:01:17.338 --> 01:01:19.827
You have a john?

01:01:48.077 --> 01:01:49.191
Men!

01:02:00.129 --> 01:02:02.915
Hey, where'd you come from?

01:02:03.882 --> 01:02:07.831
Geez, you scared the piss out of me.

01:02:09.596 --> 01:02:11.553
Oo you mind, sister?

01:02:11.973 --> 01:02:14.929
This is occupado.

01:02:40.499 --> 01:02:41.747
Ouke?

01:03:10.155 --> 01:03:13.903
Hey, innkeeper, I need change!
- Charlie, I got it.

01:03:44.395 --> 01:03:47.146
Get away from me.

01:03:48.148 --> 01:03:51.019
Looks like someone's getting lucky!

01:04:31.982 --> 01:04:33.810
What's happening?

01:04:34.236 --> 01:04:36.027
Come on, Leo.

01:04:38.031 --> 01:04:41.233
Oon't go up there.
- Why? Something's wrong with Norman?

01:04:41.658 --> 01:04:44.777
It's time somebody told you.

01:05:07.517 --> 01:05:12.012
Good morning, Norman. It's a bit hot
to be sleeping so late, isn't it?

01:05:12.437 --> 01:05:14.560
We had a lot of revelers last night.
- I know.

01:05:14.981 --> 01:05:18.682
One didn't come home.
Name is Patsy Boyle.

01:05:19.110 --> 01:05:22.895
She came with a group of locals
to party after the game.

01:05:23.866 --> 01:05:28.159
When they all left around 3,
nobody noticed that she wasn't there.

01:05:28.579 --> 01:05:32.990
Someone's missing and you come to me.
- There have been other accusations.

01:05:33.415 --> 01:05:35.703
From that reporter! She knows nothing.

01:05:36.125 --> 01:05:39.957
That's what we're going to find out.
Now it's too hot to argue.

01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:44.212
That rain made everything more muggy.
- Nothing back there. - Of course not.

01:05:44.635 --> 01:05:46.922
Please get out of my house.
- Sorry, Norman.

01:05:47.348 --> 01:05:52.422
We have the warrant.
It's in everybody's best interest.

01:05:53.477 --> 01:05:55.885
Who's? There's nothing here.
I didn't do anything.

01:05:56.314 --> 01:06:00.642
Then there's nothing to worry about.
Norman, come back!

01:06:02.234 --> 01:06:04.903
Get him, Leo. Ooggone you!

01:06:28.759 --> 01:06:32.627
Norman,
what the hell's the matter with you?

01:06:38.602 --> 01:06:40.060
Mother?

01:06:44.983 --> 01:06:46.562
I'm sorry, Norman.

01:06:47.654 --> 01:06:51.236
All seems a little unnecessary now.
- That's okay.

01:06:51.658 --> 01:06:55.701
Still no reason to get so...
so riled up.

01:06:56.119 --> 01:06:58.444
We'll leave you alone now. Again,

01:06:58.872 --> 01:07:02.076
I'm sorry. - That's not enough.
You just can't let it lie!

01:07:02.501 --> 01:07:06.082
I've had enough
of this Nancy Orew horseshit.

01:07:07.132 --> 01:07:09.538
I'm letting it lie and so are you.

01:07:10.259 --> 01:07:15.501
Until I have evidence to the contrary,
both ladies are missing persons.

01:07:15.931 --> 01:07:17.888
Aren't you going to question him?

01:07:18.308 --> 01:07:21.722
Why not drag the swamp?
He dumped the last bodies there.

01:07:22.143 --> 01:07:24.634
Oon't tell me my job,
Ms. Vanderbilt.

01:07:25.063 --> 01:07:27.269
Somebody has to.

01:07:27.690 --> 01:07:32.104
You're not going to let him go?
- Oespite all your glib insinuations,

01:07:32.528 --> 01:07:35.816
I don't have one iota of proof.
- He didn't do it.

01:07:36.242 --> 01:07:38.946
Norman was with me
until 6 o'clock this morning.

01:07:39.370 --> 01:07:41.612
Whatever happened to that girl,

01:07:42.039 --> 01:07:45.206
he didn't have anything to do with it.
- Well, Miss,

01:07:47.502 --> 01:07:51.201
had you told us sooner, you would
have saved us a lot of trouble.

01:07:51.630 --> 01:07:54.631
No one asked me.
- Come on, Leo.

01:07:55.426 --> 01:07:57.881
Bad time to beat the street, Norman.

01:07:58.303 --> 01:08:01.259
You'd better follow
the sheriff's example.

01:08:01.682 --> 01:08:07.270
I'm taking a passenger. Ready?

01:08:18.573 --> 01:08:21.443
She told you about me, didn't she?
- Yes.

01:08:21.868 --> 01:08:23.741
Where are you going?

01:08:25.371 --> 01:08:29.156
Father Brian said I could come stay
with him if I needed to.

01:08:29.584 --> 01:08:31.741
Please let me go.

01:09:03.991 --> 01:09:05.237
Mother!

01:09:08.828 --> 01:09:10.027
Mother!

01:09:37.148 --> 01:09:39.435
Mother, where are you?

01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:48.039
I love the silver
that shines in your hair.

01:10:48.467 --> 01:10:52.594
And the brow that's all furled
and wrinkled with care.

01:10:53.012 --> 01:10:56.962
I kissed the dear fingers,
so toilworn for me.

01:10:57.391 --> 01:11:02.350
Oh God bless you and keep you,
dear Mother...

01:11:03.397 --> 01:11:04.512
Bates.

01:11:07.236 --> 01:11:10.271
It doesn't scan, does it, Norman?

01:11:11.154 --> 01:11:12.235
But...

01:11:12.657 --> 01:11:15.444
a lot of shit around here doesn't.

01:11:15.868 --> 01:11:17.695
What are you doing with my mother?

01:11:18.496 --> 01:11:19.989
Oon't you mean...

01:11:20.413 --> 01:11:21.990
Mummy?

01:11:25.501 --> 01:11:28.075
You did a nice job on her, Norman.

01:11:28.504 --> 01:11:30.792
Fresh as the day she was croaked.

01:11:34.178 --> 01:11:35.125
Why?

01:11:35.553 --> 01:11:37.296
Just looking out for you.

01:11:37.721 --> 01:11:40.926
And yourself.
- I have ambitions, dreams.

01:11:41.351 --> 01:11:44.019
But dreams don't come cheap nowadays.

01:11:44.437 --> 01:11:46.892
I could have turned
Mom over to the cops,

01:11:47.314 --> 01:11:50.764
but all I would have gotten
was a pat on the back.

01:11:51.943 --> 01:11:54.564
That reporter
would've shelled out a few bucks,

01:11:54.988 --> 01:11:59.778
and gotten the lion's share
of the credit, a five-figure salary,

01:12:00.203 --> 01:12:02.490
and a big news job.

01:12:02.913 --> 01:12:07.242
Fine for her dreams,
but what about mine? No.

01:12:07.667 --> 01:12:12.661
I figure Mama's greatest value to me
is in her value to you.

01:12:13.088 --> 01:12:15.496
I don't have that kind of money.
- Oon't gripe to me.

01:12:15.924 --> 01:12:18.842
With that big piece of real estate
and this thriving business,

01:12:19.261 --> 01:12:23.009
you could just sell an acre.

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:26.308
Please, Ouke.
I want my mother back.

01:12:26.728 --> 01:12:30.096
Take her. You know what I want.

01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:34.066
And you know what I'll do
if I don't get it.

01:12:34.485 --> 01:12:36.441
I know.

01:12:41.948 --> 01:12:45.068
I'm going to kill you,
you little freak.

01:13:01.386 --> 01:13:03.507
You think I'm stupid, Ouke?

01:13:04.972 --> 01:13:09.182
Even if I gave you money,
you'd still tell on Mother.

01:13:09.601 --> 01:13:12.269
No one must know what she did.

01:13:15.981 --> 01:13:17.724
She can't help it.

01:13:18.150 --> 01:13:22.777
She can't help the things she does.
She's just an old lady.

01:13:23.197 --> 01:13:24.857
A sick, old lady.

01:13:34.458 --> 01:13:36.083
Watch the guitar!

01:13:46.426 --> 01:13:50.638
You shouldn't sneak up
on a guy like that, Ouke. Ouke?

01:13:51.892 --> 01:13:55.307
I didn't mean it.

01:13:57.897 --> 01:14:01.846
You made me do this!
Your tainted blood in me!

01:14:04.194 --> 01:14:08.608
Oon't laugh at me, Mother.
Oon't laugh at me.

01:14:11.534 --> 01:14:16.493
I didn't even know she had any kids.
- Wasn't it on her job application?

01:14:16.916 --> 01:14:19.585
She was already here
when I bought the place? years ago.

01:14:20.002 --> 01:14:24.415
Best waitress I ever had.
- She worked for the previous owner?

01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:28.456
Harvey Leech. - Where's he now?
- He used to be in a nursing home.

01:14:28.884 --> 01:14:32.217
Outside town.
- Probably dead now.

01:14:38.768 --> 01:14:41.522
Spool?
- Emma Spool.

01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:45.474
She worked in your diner.
- Oiner?

01:14:46.277 --> 01:14:50.690
Yeah, I had a diner once.
- Mrs. Spool used to work for you.

01:14:51.115 --> 01:14:55.775
I had a woman named Spool
who used to work for me. A waitress.

01:14:56.202 --> 01:14:58.194
She come from that place.
- Place?

01:14:58.620 --> 01:15:02.322
That place for nuts. As-s-asylum.

01:15:02.749 --> 01:15:05.038
Mrs Spool was in an asylum?

01:15:05.459 --> 01:15:08.711
Asylum, that's it, asylum.

01:15:09.132 --> 01:15:11.705
You know, she killed somebody.

01:15:12.553 --> 01:15:15.553
Who?
- Somebody. Husband?

01:15:18.724 --> 01:15:23.800
I don't recall. Good waitress, Spool.

01:15:26.814 --> 01:15:30.598
Are you sure, Maureen?
- Oh yes.

01:15:31.027 --> 01:15:34.195
Norman understands me.
He understands forgiveness.

01:15:34.614 --> 01:15:38.362
I failed so many people, Father.
I won't fail him.

01:15:38.785 --> 01:15:43.245
That's why Mary came to me
the night he saved my life.

01:15:43.664 --> 01:15:45.906
It was a sign.

01:15:47.876 --> 01:15:52.834
And the woman in the window.
That must've been Mary too.

01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:30.623
I'll be back, Mother.

01:18:43.503 --> 01:18:47.916
Miserere mei, Oeus...

01:20:04.204 --> 01:20:08.783
I thought if she saw these copies
she might change her story.

01:20:10.795 --> 01:20:12.703
Can I see her?

01:20:13.130 --> 01:20:14.837
I'm afraid not.

01:20:39.196 --> 01:20:40.311
Norman!

01:21:10.726 --> 01:21:13.643
Norman? It's me.

01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:17.722
I've come back.

01:21:24.865 --> 01:21:27.783
I never should've gone away.

01:21:29.702 --> 01:21:33.321
Whatever happened to you in your past,

01:21:33.748 --> 01:21:37.032
I know you're good. You took a life,

01:21:37.459 --> 01:21:39.997
but you also saved a life.

01:21:40.420 --> 01:21:41.964
My life.

01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:44.997
Let it be your life.

01:21:47.096 --> 01:21:48.258
Oh, Norman!

01:21:51.808 --> 01:21:55.342
What happened to you?
- I slipped in the mud.

01:21:56.103 --> 01:21:57.681
I slipped too.

01:21:58.105 --> 01:22:00.939
I know I've hurt you.

01:22:01.357 --> 01:22:03.682
Can you forgive me?
- Norman!

01:22:21.295 --> 01:22:23.537
Maureen? Maureen?

01:22:33.304 --> 01:22:36.009
Mother!

01:22:47.486 --> 01:22:48.860
Maureen?

01:23:30.443 --> 01:23:33.018
Get that whore out of my house!

01:23:33.448 --> 01:23:37.194
Throw her down in the mud,
filth, where she belongs.

01:23:38.702 --> 01:23:42.152
I'll get you for this, Mother.
I'll get you for this.

01:23:42.955 --> 01:23:46.324
You haven't got the guts, boy.

01:25:45.028 --> 01:25:48.399
You dumb, stupid,

01:25:48.825 --> 01:25:51.495
naive girl.

01:25:59.752 --> 01:26:03.085
Why can't you leave my poor son,
my Norman, alone?

01:26:13.433 --> 01:26:17.975
What set you off again, Norman?
You killed Mrs. Spool, didn't you?

01:26:20.105 --> 01:26:23.023
Oid she tell you
that she was your mother?

01:26:23.442 --> 01:26:26.478
She was crazy, Norman,
but she wasn't your mother.

01:26:26.903 --> 01:26:28.730
Neither are you!

01:26:30.823 --> 01:26:33.659
She was your aunt,
and in love with your father.

01:26:34.077 --> 01:26:37.859
But your mother stole him
away from her. Emma Spool...

01:26:38.287 --> 01:26:43.994
killed your father in a jealous rage
and kidnapped you as a baby.

01:26:48.548 --> 01:26:52.712
She killed your father
because she thought you were hers.

01:26:53.761 --> 01:26:56.678
The child
she should've had with him.

01:26:59.599 --> 01:27:01.059
She was crazy.

01:27:01.478 --> 01:27:06.271
They locked her away.
- It's lies, it's all lies.

01:27:07.526 --> 01:27:10.395
She's a lying whore.
- Norman, where are you?

01:27:10.820 --> 01:27:12.694
She's a slut.

01:27:16.075 --> 01:27:19.325
Oon't let her talk about me like that.

01:27:21.747 --> 01:27:23.370
Norman, please listen to me!

01:27:23.998 --> 01:27:30.083
Norman, Mrs. Bates! Whoever you are.
It doesn't matter to me.

01:27:30.504 --> 01:27:33.507
Get her, boy.
Get her, just like the others!

01:27:36.803 --> 01:27:40.255
Get her!
- No! No!

01:27:40.683 --> 01:27:45.178
Oon't! Oon't! Please! Norman!

01:27:45.603 --> 01:27:46.634
No!

01:27:48.063 --> 01:27:52.357
Norman, can't you do anything right?

01:27:54.111 --> 01:27:58.988
How dare you treat your mother
in such ways.

01:28:01.619 --> 01:28:04.489
So, I don't have the guts, huh?

01:28:46.159 --> 01:28:49.364
I was for you, Norman.
Believed in you.

01:28:50.206 --> 01:28:53.328
You made a fool of me.
Look what you did to yourself!

01:28:53.752 --> 01:28:55.412
Why, Norman, why?

01:28:55.837 --> 01:28:59.752
Good God, son,
you'll never get out again.

01:29:02.218 --> 01:29:03.879
They're going to lock you up forever.

01:29:05.429 --> 01:29:09.757
But I'll be free.
I'll finally be free.
