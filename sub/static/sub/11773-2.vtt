WEBVTT

00:06.433 --> 00:08.533
( theme music playing )

00:15.367 --> 00:16.767
- Larry: OKAY, FINE.
- Cheryl: LET'S GO.

00:16.800 --> 00:18.300
- CAN I TAKE A BREAK?
- NO!

00:18.333 --> 00:19.933
- WHY?
- LET'S PUSH THROUGH HIS.

00:19.967 --> 00:22.600
WORK IT, COME ON, YEAH,
SO WE CAN GET THIS DONE.

00:22.633 --> 00:25.200
THIS HOUSE FEELS
LIKE A HOTEL TO ME.

00:25.233 --> 00:27.300
- HOTEL, REALLY?
- YEAH.

00:27.333 --> 00:30.333
SHE'S RIGHT ABOUT THAT.
IT'S NOT AS NICE
AS THE OTHER HOUSE.

00:30.367 --> 00:33.733
- Larry: I AGREE WITH YOU.
IT'S NOT AS NICE.
- ( cell phone rings )

00:33.767 --> 00:37.633
HI, TED. I KNOW.
NO NO, WE'RE HERE.

00:37.667 --> 00:40.200
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF IT RIGHT NOW.

00:40.233 --> 00:42.800
( giggles ) I KNOW.
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

00:42.833 --> 00:45.333
- YOU HEAR THIS?
- HMM?

00:45.367 --> 00:48.233
- SHE'S TALKING
TO TED DANSON.
- THAT WAS A GUY?

00:48.267 --> 00:50.133
- YEAH.
- I THOUGHT IT WAS
A GIRL.

00:50.167 --> 00:53.233
- NO NO, THEY HAVE LITTLE
CHATS ON THE CELL PHONE.
- NO, THEY DON'T.

00:53.267 --> 00:54.767
- THEY DO ALL DAY LONG.
- REALLY?

00:54.800 --> 00:57.700
YEAH, I'M TELLING YOU,
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

00:57.733 --> 01:00.700
AND WHEN THEY'RE TOGETHER,
SHE GOES LIKE THIS.
SHE GIVES HIM A SLAP.

01:00.733 --> 01:02.633
- TOUCHING LIKE THAT?
- YEAH, LIKE A PLAYFUL SLAP.

01:02.667 --> 01:05.167
- OH, THE FLIRTATIOUS SLAP.
- THE FLIRTATIOUS TAP.

01:05.200 --> 01:06.500
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

01:06.533 --> 01:09.933
- THAT'S LIKE SEX
FOR PLATONIC FRIENDS.
- YEAH.

01:09.967 --> 01:11.767
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T TOUCH
EACH OTHER, IT'S FORBIDDEN.

01:11.800 --> 01:13.833
SO THEY'RE ALLOWED
TO GO LIKE THAT.

01:13.867 --> 01:16.967
- ( knock on door )
- ALL RIGHT, I'M DONE
HELPING YOU MOVE.

01:17.067 --> 01:19.900
- HEY, THANKS SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.
- MY PLEASURE.

01:19.933 --> 01:22.800
- ARE YOU GOING TO
THE N.R.D.C. OPENING TOMORROW?
- YEAH YEAH, OF COURSE.

01:22.833 --> 01:24.133
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE NAMING
A WING AFTER ME.

01:24.167 --> 01:26.600
- NAMING A WING?
- YEAH, I GAVE 'EM A TON
OF MONEY.

01:26.633 --> 01:29.433
- WELL, GOOD FOR YOU.
- I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

01:29.467 --> 01:32.433
- LARRY, LARRY DAVID?
- YEAH.

01:32.467 --> 01:34.533
WHERE'S LORETTA?
LORETTA!

01:34.567 --> 01:38.333

01:38.367 --> 01:40.333
LOOK AT YOU, BOY.
BABY GIRL!

01:40.367 --> 01:43.400
OH MY GOD,
YOU ALL LIVING LARGE.

01:43.433 --> 01:45.600
- WHAT'S UP, SISTER?
- BOY, WHAT YOU DOING HERE?

01:45.633 --> 01:47.467
WHAT YOU DOING HERE?

01:47.500 --> 01:49.633
UH-OH, I KNEW I SMELLED
SOME COOKING.

01:49.667 --> 01:52.500
DO I SMELL FOOD?
COME HERE, AUNTIE.

01:52.533 --> 01:54.967
( all laughing )

01:55.067 --> 01:57.833
- WHO IS THIS GUY?
- THAT'S MY BROTHER LEON.

01:57.867 --> 02:01.500
WHAT'S UP, GIRL?

02:01.533 --> 02:03.300
WHICH ROOM
HE GONNA STAY IN?

02:03.333 --> 02:05.433
- WHAT?
- WHICH ROOM HE
GONNA STAY IN?

02:05.467 --> 02:07.700
- YOU CAN STAY IN MY ROOM,
UNCLE LEON.
- YEAH, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

02:07.733 --> 02:10.133
- LET ME GET MY BAG.
- SHOW HIM WHERE
THE ROOM IS AT.

02:10.167 --> 02:12.233
Auntie Rae: ALL RIGHT.

02:12.267 --> 02:15.067
COME ON, BOY!
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH!

02:15.067 --> 02:18.100
- WAS HE IN THE HURRICANE?
- NO, HE LIVES HERE
IN L.A.

02:22.867 --> 02:25.067
CHERYL!

02:28.533 --> 02:30.433
Leon:
BOY, I DON'T KNOW.

02:30.467 --> 02:33.567
I WONDER IF COOKING
GOOD IS HEREDITARY.

02:33.600 --> 02:34.700
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

02:34.733 --> 02:36.433
YEAH, SEE, LORETTA PUT
HER FOOT IN IT THIS TIME.

02:36.467 --> 02:39.300
LORETTA PUT
HER FOOT IN IT,
TURNED IT AROUND,

02:39.333 --> 02:42.433
AND KICKED YOU
IN YOUR OWN ASSHOLE.
YOU FEEL ME?

02:42.467 --> 02:44.467
WATCH YOUR MOUTH
IN FRONT OF THE CHILDREN.

02:44.500 --> 02:47.433
LOOKS GOOD, DON'T IT,
DON'T IT?

02:47.467 --> 02:50.267
MAN, OH, MAN, WHAT ARE
YOU TRYING TO DO TO YOUR
FAMILY WITH THIS FOOD?

02:50.300 --> 02:52.833
- YOU'RE GONNA KILL 'EM.
- WHAT YOU TALKING
ABOUT, L.D.?

02:52.867 --> 02:55.267
COME ON,
ALL THAT CHOLESTEROL.
IT'S NO GOOD FOR YOU.

02:55.300 --> 02:58.067
LARRY, CAN I TALK
TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

02:58.100 --> 03:01.867
REALLY THINK ABOUT
GETTING RID OF ALL
THE BACON

03:01.900 --> 03:03.867
AND THE SAUSAGE
AND EVERYTHING.

03:03.900 --> 03:05.267
I'M GONNA THINK
ABOUT EATING IT.

03:05.300 --> 03:07.567
( laughing )

03:07.600 --> 03:09.300
YOU CRAZY, GIRL!

03:12.467 --> 03:14.500
I'M A LITTLE CREEPED OUT
RIGHT NOW.

03:14.533 --> 03:18.267
OKAY, I WAS JUST
IN LEON'S ROOM PUTTING
SOME FLOWERS IN THERE.

03:18.300 --> 03:21.467
- LEON'S ROOM?
- YEAH, AND THERE'S A...

03:21.500 --> 03:24.967
THERE'S A STAIN
ON THE BLANKET.

03:25.067 --> 03:29.067
- WHAT KIND OF STAIN?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- LIKE WHEN A GUY...

03:29.067 --> 03:31.267
YOU KNOW,
AND DOES HIS BUSINESS,
AND HE'S ALONE.

03:32.567 --> 03:34.167
IT'S SO GROSS.

03:34.200 --> 03:36.200
- ARE YOU KIDDING?
- NO.

03:36.233 --> 03:39.300
HEY, EVERYBODY IN
THE FAMILY HAVE
THEM BIG ONES.

03:39.333 --> 03:42.633
- FIRST NIGHT
IN OUR HOUSE?
- I KNOW.

03:42.667 --> 03:46.067
OKAY,
I'M GONNA TALK TO HIM.

03:46.067 --> 03:48.867
- NO, OH, GOD.
- WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING?

03:48.900 --> 03:51.500
I DON'T WANT TO SOME GUY
STAYING HERE MASTURBATING
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

03:51.533 --> 03:52.933
YOU CAN'T TALK
TO HIM ABOUT IT.

03:52.967 --> 03:55.533
- LEON.
- LARRY.

03:55.567 --> 03:56.933
CAN I TALK
TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

03:56.967 --> 03:59.367
EXCUSE ME, LADIES.
I SHALL RETURN.

03:59.400 --> 04:02.733
OH MY GOD.
I GOTTA GET SOMETHING
OVER TO...

04:02.767 --> 04:05.233
ALL RIGHT.
MAN, I'M ABOUT TO BUST.

04:05.267 --> 04:08.533
- ENJOYED YOUR BREAKFAST?
- LARRY, YOU KNOW HOW
TO BRING IT.

04:08.567 --> 04:10.667
- THAT'S NICE.
- I'M ABOUT TO BLOW UP.

04:10.700 --> 04:13.167
- I JUST SPOKE
TO MY WIFE.
- OKAY.

04:13.200 --> 04:16.733
AND SHE SAID SHE WAS
PUTTING SOME FLOWERS
IN YOUR ROOM.

04:18.200 --> 04:21.867
AND SHE FOUND A STAIN...

04:21.900 --> 04:23.233
ON YOUR BLANKET.

04:23.267 --> 04:25.733
STAIN ON MY BLANKET, HUH?

04:25.767 --> 04:27.700
WHAT, LIKE JUICE,

04:27.733 --> 04:29.700
SYRUP, MAYBE SYRUP
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

04:29.733 --> 04:32.067
HUH-UH, NO.

04:32.067 --> 04:34.567
GRAVIES MAYBE, SOMETHING
IN THE GRAVY CATEGORY?

04:34.600 --> 04:36.500
HUH-UH, NO.

04:36.533 --> 04:38.333
WHAT KIND OF STAIN
WAS IT?

04:39.767 --> 04:42.633
- HMM?
- EJACULATE.

04:42.667 --> 04:44.400
E-WHAT?

04:44.433 --> 04:45.800
EJACULATE.

04:45.833 --> 04:47.333
AJACKALIT.

04:47.367 --> 04:50.100
NOT AJACKALIT.
EJACULATE.

04:50.133 --> 04:52.833
EJACULATE?

04:55.567 --> 04:57.800
CUM STAIN. CUM.

04:57.833 --> 04:59.867
CUM STAIN.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.133
WHAT KIND OF CUM
WAS IT, FIRST OF ALL?

05:02.167 --> 05:04.200
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WHAT KIND OF CUM?
CUM'S CUM.

05:04.233 --> 05:06.167
- CUM IS NOT CUM, LARRY.
- CUM'S CUM.

05:06.200 --> 05:09.400
IT COULDN'T HAVE
BEEN MINE. KNOW WHY?
'CAUSE I GETS MINE, LARRY.

05:09.433 --> 05:11.400
I BRINGS THE RUCKUS
TO THE LADIES.

05:11.433 --> 05:13.900
OKAY, SO YOU'RE
DENYING THIS.
IS THAT IT?

05:13.933 --> 05:15.933
FIRST OF ALL,
LOOK AROUND THIS
PLACE, MAN.

05:15.967 --> 05:18.400
ARE THERE ANY VISUALS
AROUND HERE TO JACK OFF TO?

05:18.433 --> 05:20.167
ALL WE HAVE
IS BASIC CABLE, RIGHT?

05:20.200 --> 05:22.233
WHAT AM I DOING,
JACKING OFF TO
"ANDY GRIFFITH"?

05:22.267 --> 05:24.067
JACKING OFF TO CLARA,
HUH?

05:24.067 --> 05:26.400
- YOU MEAN AUNT BEA?
- AUNT BEA, CLARA, WHOEVER.

05:26.433 --> 05:29.200
- WHO'S CLARA?
- WHO'S THE LADY
WHO ANSWER THE PHONE?

05:29.233 --> 05:31.667
- I DON'T KNOW.
- IS THAT HER NAME,
CLARA?

05:31.700 --> 05:33.167
I DON'T KNOW CLARA.
I KNOW AUNT BEA.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.233
NOBODY WANNA JACK OFF
TO NO DAMN AUNT BEA.

05:35.267 --> 05:37.200
I DON'T REMEMBER
ANY BEAUTIES ON
THAT SHOW, FRANKLY.

05:37.233 --> 05:38.800
IT'S NOT MY CUM,
LARRY.

05:38.833 --> 05:42.067
- OKAY?
- OKAY.

05:44.167 --> 05:47.567
SO, YEAH, JUST GET
THE BLANKET CLEAN.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.800
- THIS IS IT?
- THAT'S ALL, YEAH.

05:49.833 --> 05:53.067
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:53.100 --> 05:54.667
YOU WANT ME
TO CLEAN THE BLANKET.

05:54.700 --> 05:57.867
YEAH, SO JUST
THROW IT IN THE BIN.
YOU DON'T NEED TO...

05:57.900 --> 06:01.067
I DON'T HAVE A BIN, LARRY.
I HAVE TO LOOK AT IT
TO SEE WHAT KIND

06:01.100 --> 06:03.633
- OF CLEANING--
- YOU DON'T NEED
TO INSPECT IT.

06:03.667 --> 06:05.900
LARRY, DO YOU WANT ME
TO CLEAN THE BLANKET
OR NOT?

06:05.933 --> 06:08.367
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU THROW IT IN.

06:08.400 --> 06:10.800
OH... ( laughing )

06:12.500 --> 06:15.533
OKAY, I HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THAT.

06:15.567 --> 06:17.267
SURE, LARRY,
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

06:17.300 --> 06:20.100
NO, SOMEBODY'S STAYING
AT MY HOUSE, AND I'M SURE
HE DID THAT.

06:20.133 --> 06:23.467
LARRY, I COULD GIVE A SHIT
IF IT WAS SANTA CLAUS.
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET IT OFF.

06:23.500 --> 06:26.167
NO, I'M JUST TELLING YOU,
OKAY, THAT I HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THAT.

06:26.200 --> 06:28.967
- THAT'S NOT MY STAIN.
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
- OKAY OKAY.

06:30.767 --> 06:33.233
YOU LOOK VERY CUTE
WHEN YOU'RE ALL BLUSHY.

06:33.267 --> 06:36.833
- YOU THINK I'M GONNA TELL?
I'M YOUR FRIEND, LARRY.
- I DIDN'T DO IT.

06:36.867 --> 06:39.233
I'M NOT GONNA LIE
ABOUT THAT.

06:39.267 --> 06:41.767
YOU'RE REALLY INSANE,
YOU KNOW?

06:41.800 --> 06:43.967
LARRY.

06:44.067 --> 06:46.133
I DON'T SEE
MY YANKEE JERSEY...

06:47.700 --> 06:50.233
- BY THE WAY.
- HUH.

06:50.267 --> 06:53.867
- SEE THAT?
- WOW, IT MUST
BE GONE THEN.

06:53.900 --> 06:55.833
I'M SORRY, LARRY.

06:55.867 --> 06:57.500
WHAT?

06:57.533 --> 06:59.800
WHAT? IT HAPPENS,
LARRY. THAT'S WHAT
HAPPENS SOMETIMES.

06:59.833 --> 07:02.867
NO NO NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
THAT'S JOE PEPITONE'S JERSEY.

07:02.900 --> 07:05.900
I'VE HAD THAT JERSEY
SINCE I WAS A KID.
NUMBER 25.

07:05.933 --> 07:09.400
IT'S GONE.
SOMEBODY ELSE MUST
HAVE TAKEN IT.

07:09.433 --> 07:12.267
WELL, DO YOU THINK
THEY'LL RETURN IT?

07:12.300 --> 07:15.100
LARRY, IN ALL
THE MANY YEARS
I'VE WORKED HERE

07:15.133 --> 07:17.600
AT THE DRY CLEANERS,
NO ONE EVER RETURNS
ANYTHING.

07:17.633 --> 07:21.467
SOMETIMES YOU GET HOME
AND YOU HAVE SOMETHING
THAT ISN'T YOURS,

07:21.500 --> 07:24.333
AND SOMETIMES SOMETHING
OF YOURS GETS TAKEN.

07:24.367 --> 07:26.833
THAT'S JUST THE UNWRITTEN
LAW OF DRY CLEANING.

07:26.867 --> 07:28.467
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT.

07:28.500 --> 07:30.067
- REALLY?
- REALLY.

07:30.067 --> 07:31.967
WELL, I DON'T SUBSCRIBE
TO THAT LAW.

07:32.067 --> 07:35.067
OH, WELL, THEN MAYBE YOU
SHOULD CHANGE IT.

07:35.067 --> 07:37.867
- MAYBE I WILL.
- GOOD.

07:37.900 --> 07:40.767
I'LL HAVE YOUR
SEMEN-COVERED
BLANKET READY

07:40.800 --> 07:42.400
ON WEDNESDAY.

07:48.867 --> 07:51.200
Larry: SO I CONFRONTED HIM.
OF COURSE HE DENIED IT,

07:51.233 --> 07:53.100
BUT I MEAN, COME ON,
GIVE ME A BREAK.

07:53.133 --> 07:56.133
HE WAS IN THE ROOM.
I MEAN, WHO ELSE
COULD IT BE?

07:56.167 --> 07:58.133
YOU GOTTA KICK HIM OUT,
HANDS DOWN.

07:58.167 --> 07:59.900
FIRST NIGHT
IN THE HOUSE.

08:00.067 --> 08:02.267
HEY HEY, I DID IT.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.233
COME ON,
NO BIG DEAL.

08:06.267 --> 08:07.667
YOU DID IT?

08:07.700 --> 08:09.600
YEAH, DID IT,
YEP, ME.

08:11.067 --> 08:13.067
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?
- YEAH, WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

08:13.067 --> 08:14.633
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

08:14.667 --> 08:16.067
IT WAS PASSOVER
AT YOUR HOUSE.

08:16.067 --> 08:18.433
I WAS DRINKING
A LITTLE BIT,

08:18.467 --> 08:19.933
HAD SOME MANISCHEWITZ,
YOU KNOW?

08:19.967 --> 08:22.633
FEELING GOOD,
AND I WAS AWAY
FROM THE TABLE.

08:22.667 --> 08:25.567
I GOT AN ERECTION.
I TOOK CARE OF IT
BEFORE I CAME BACK.

08:25.600 --> 08:28.500
I DIDN'T WANT TO COME
BACK TO THE TABLE WITH
AN ERECTION AT PASSOVER.

08:30.067 --> 08:32.400
- ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?
- NO, IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

08:32.433 --> 08:34.200
- PASSOVER?
- IT'S NOT LIKE YOM KIPPUR.

08:34.233 --> 08:36.133
- I WOULD NEVER DO IT
ON THE HIGH HOLIDAYS.
- HE WOULDN'T DO IT

08:36.167 --> 08:37.667
- ON A HIGH HOLIDAY.
- NO, I WOULDN'T.

08:37.700 --> 08:38.967
YOU'RE LIKE A MONKEY.

08:39.067 --> 08:41.067
- A MONKEY.
- YOU ARE.

08:41.100 --> 08:43.700
- YOU DIDN'T DO A VERY
GOOD JOB OF CLEANING UP.
- I DID THE BEST I COULD.

08:43.733 --> 08:45.600
- THAT'S THE BEST YOU COULD?
- I HAD TO GET BACK
TO THE TABLE.

08:45.633 --> 08:48.700
THEY WERE DOING THE FOUR
QUESTIONS AND I LOVE
THE FOUR QUESTIONS.

08:48.733 --> 08:50.067
GOTTA GET BACK.
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

08:50.067 --> 08:52.267
- I LOVE THE FOUR QUESTIONS.
- THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

08:52.300 --> 08:53.933
- NO BIG DEAL.
- IT IS A BIG DEAL.

08:53.967 --> 08:55.900
COME TO MY HOUSE AND DO IT.
WHAT DO I GIVE A SHIT?

08:55.933 --> 08:57.833
COME ON OVER AND WHACK OFF.
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

08:57.867 --> 09:00.067
( all laugh )

09:00.067 --> 09:01.400
OH, LISTEN,

09:01.433 --> 09:03.833
I LEFT MY SUNGLASSES
AT YOUR HOUSE. I NEED 'EM
DESPERATELY.

09:03.867 --> 09:06.900
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL LOOK FOR 'EM.
- DON'T LET HIM IN YOUR HOUSE.

09:06.933 --> 09:09.433
- HI, GUYS.
- HEY!

09:09.467 --> 09:11.800
- LOOK AT YOU.
- NO, LOOK AT YOU.

09:11.833 --> 09:13.767
- YOU ARE MISS NRDC.
- LOOK AT YOU!

09:13.800 --> 09:16.767
- WELL, THANK YOU.
- YOU MAKE ME WANNA
SAVE THE PLANET.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.933
- SO, SHOULD WE GO IN,
- OKAY, LET'S GO IN.

09:18.967 --> 09:21.067
SEE THE NEW WING?

09:21.067 --> 09:22.500
CALL ME, ACTUALLY.
I HAVE SOMETHING
TO TELL YOU.

09:22.533 --> 09:26.200
- I'VE GOT SOMETHING
TO TELL YOU, TOO.
- OH, SAYING HELLO?

09:26.233 --> 09:29.100
- HELLO.
- OH, HI.

09:31.867 --> 09:35.433
WHY ARE YOU AND TED
ALWAYS KIND OF HITTING
EACH OTHER ALL THE TIME?

09:35.467 --> 09:37.900
ALL THIS PLAYFUL HITTING?
ALL THAT STUFF?

09:37.933 --> 09:40.200
IT'S NOT A CONSCIOUS THING.
I DON'T KNOW.

09:40.233 --> 09:42.267
I'M EXPRESSIVE
WITH MY HANDS.

09:42.300 --> 09:45.967
- HEY...
- ( gasps )

09:46.067 --> 09:48.167
- Cheryl: LARRY DAVID.
THAT'S GREAT.
- HUH?

09:48.200 --> 09:50.433
- NEVER HAD A WING BEFORE.
- I KNOW.

09:50.467 --> 09:53.500
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.
PRETTY GOOD.

09:53.533 --> 09:57.133
- IT'S YOUR NIGHT TO SHINE.
- YEAH YEAH, IT'S GREAT.

10:02.967 --> 10:06.767
WHAT IS THAT?
"WING DONATED
BY ANONYMOUS."

10:06.800 --> 10:09.433
- YEAH, YEAH.
- ANONYMOUS?

10:11.300 --> 10:13.600
I'M NOT CRAZY ABOUT THAT.
NOW IT LOOKS LIKE...

10:13.633 --> 10:16.833
JUST LOOKS LIKE I DID MINE
FOR THE CREDIT

10:16.867 --> 10:20.667
AS OPPOSED TO, YOU KNOW,
MR. WONDERFUL "ANONYMOUS."

10:20.700 --> 10:23.800
I KNOW WHO IT IS.

10:25.333 --> 10:27.567
IT'S TED.

10:27.600 --> 10:29.200
TED IS ANONYMOUS.

10:29.233 --> 10:31.533
WHAT ARE YOU,
KIDDING?

10:31.567 --> 10:34.300
NO, ISN'T THAT GREAT?

10:34.333 --> 10:37.833
HE DONATED A WHOLE WING
AND DIDN'T WANT
ANYBODY TO KNOW.

10:37.867 --> 10:41.233
WELL, HE TOLD YOU,
SO HE APPARENTLY
WANTED SOMEBODY TO KNOW.

10:41.267 --> 10:42.933
HE TOLD ME, OKAY?

10:42.967 --> 10:45.900
WHO ELSE DID HE TELL?
HOW DO YOU KNOW HE
JUST TOLD YOU?

10:45.933 --> 10:48.333
THE POINT IS THAT
HE DIDN'T NEED
ALL THE FANFARE--

10:48.367 --> 10:50.067
FANFARE? WHAT FANFARE?
I DON'T LIKE THE FANFARE.

10:50.100 --> 10:51.967
YOU'RE SAYING
I LIKE FANFARE?

10:52.000 --> 10:54.967
HE CAN TELL A FEW PEOPLE.
HE JUST DOESN'T NEED
THE WHOLE WORLD TO KNOW

10:55.000 --> 10:56.500
THAT HE DONATED
ALL THIS MONEY.

10:56.533 --> 10:58.500
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DIDN'T NEED THE WORLD
TO KNOW, EITHER.

10:58.533 --> 11:01.800
NOBODY TOLD ME THAT
I COULD BE ANONYMOUS
AND TELL PEOPLE.

11:01.833 --> 11:04.067
I WOULD HAVE TAKEN
THAT OPTION, OKAY?

11:04.067 --> 11:07.400
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT HALFWAY.
YOU'RE EITHER ANONYMOUS
OR YOU'RE NOT.

11:07.433 --> 11:09.533
- WHAT IS IT?
- PEOPLE ARE POINTING OUT

11:09.567 --> 11:11.800
- THERE'S LARRY DAVID'S WING.
- OH, YEAH, THERE'S LARRY DAVID,

11:11.833 --> 11:14.067
THE GUY WHO HAS
TO HAVE HIS NAME UP
ON THE WALL,

11:14.067 --> 11:15.933
AS OPPOSED
TO MR. ANONYMOUS,

11:15.967 --> 11:17.467
BUT WAS REALLY TED.

11:17.500 --> 11:19.767
- I'M PROUD OF YOU.
- ANONYMOUS.

11:19.800 --> 11:22.500
IT'S FAKE PHILANTHROPY,
AND IT'S FAUX ANONYMITY.

11:22.533 --> 11:24.233
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THAT?

11:25.833 --> 11:29.467
OH, I WANT TO GO TALK
TO SENATOR BOXER.

11:29.500 --> 11:31.533
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

11:31.567 --> 11:34.600
- HI.
- HI, LARRY.

11:34.633 --> 11:37.133
- HELLO, SENATOR.
- IT IS GOOD TO SEE YOU.

11:37.167 --> 11:40.067
SENATOR, I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU

11:40.067 --> 11:41.733
ABOUT AN ISSUE

11:41.767 --> 11:45.467
THAT DOESN'T REALLY
GET A LOT OF PLAY
IN THE PAPERS.

11:45.500 --> 11:47.700
WELL, TELL ME 'CAUSE
I LIKE NEW ISSUES.

11:47.733 --> 11:51.333
OKAY, I'M TALKING
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON

11:51.367 --> 11:52.667
AT THE DRY CLEANERS.

11:52.700 --> 11:56.067
WHAT'S GOING ON
AT THE DRY CLEANERS, LARRY?

11:56.067 --> 12:00.067
WELL, WHAT HAPPENS IS
SOMETIMES THEY'LL GIVE
YOUR ITEM

12:00.067 --> 12:02.500
TO SOMEONE ELSE
AND THEN THAT
PERSON OWNS IT

12:02.533 --> 12:06.067
AND WALKS AROUND
IN IT, AND YOU
HAVE NO RECOURSE.

12:06.067 --> 12:08.667
AND THERE'S NO OVERSIGHT.
IT'S JUST COMPLETE CHAOS

12:08.700 --> 12:10.733
IN THE DRY CLEANING INDUSTRY,
AS I SEE IT.

12:10.767 --> 12:12.067
LARRY, THE THING
ABOUT IT IS

12:12.067 --> 12:14.833
THAT SOMETIMES
YOU GET AN ITEM

12:14.867 --> 12:17.433
THAT ISN'T YOURS
AND SOMETIMES YOU
LOSE AN ITEM.

12:17.467 --> 12:20.233
SO AT THE
END OF THE DAY,
IT BALANCES OUT.

12:20.267 --> 12:22.667
YEAH, WELL, IT'S NOT
BALANCING OUT FOR ME,
SENATOR.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.633
I NEVER GET AN ITEM,
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:24.667 --> 12:26.433
IF I GOT IT,
I WOULD RETURN IT,

12:26.467 --> 12:28.967
BECAUSE I THINK THE WHOLE
SYSTEM IS FLAWED.

12:29.067 --> 12:32.067
LARRY, YOU SEE
THESE SLACKS?

12:32.067 --> 12:34.300
SEE 'EM?

12:34.933 --> 12:36.833
DRY CLEANERS.

12:36.867 --> 12:39.100
THOSE ARE
SOMEBODY ELSE'S PANTS?

12:39.133 --> 12:41.200
WELL,
THEY'RE MINE NOW.

12:41.233 --> 12:43.667
- YOU'RE PART
OF THE PROBLEM, SENATOR.
- PLEASE DON'T--

12:43.700 --> 12:45.367
- ISN'T HE GREAT?
- TED.

12:45.400 --> 12:47.600
- OH, YOU KNOW
EACH OTHER, RIGHT.
- OH, YEAH.

12:47.633 --> 12:49.567
YOU LOOK FABULOUS!

12:49.600 --> 12:51.667
YOU ARE SUCH A HERO.

12:51.700 --> 12:53.867
- YOU ARE, BARBARA.
- YOU KNOW WHEN YOU FOUNDED
THE OCEANS FOUNDATION,

12:53.900 --> 12:56.700
YOU CHANGED EVERYTHING
BECAUSE HIS KIDS COULDN'T
SWIM IN THE BAY.

12:56.733 --> 13:00.067
OH OH, THE POOR
LITTLE KIDS.

13:00.100 --> 13:02.233
THEY COULDN'T SWIM
IN THE BAY.

13:02.267 --> 13:04.867
OH, WHAT ABOUT
THE 400-FOOT POOL
THEY COULD SWIM IN?

13:04.900 --> 13:06.967
THAT WASN'T AVAILABLE
TO THEM AT THE TIME?

13:07.067 --> 13:09.100
WELL, YOU KNOW,
COULD I JUST SAY,

13:09.133 --> 13:11.967
THAT ASIDE,
LOOK AT THIS.

13:12.067 --> 13:15.333
ANONYMOUS. YOU REALLY--
I KNOW. I KNOW.

13:15.367 --> 13:17.800
I DIDN'T SAY--
LARRY, DID YOU KNOW

13:17.833 --> 13:19.500
THIS ANONYMOUS IS TED?

13:19.533 --> 13:22.467
- YEAH, I DID.
- THE POINT I WANT
TO MAKE IS:

13:22.500 --> 13:23.900
YOU DIDN'T NEED
TO DO THIS.

13:23.933 --> 13:26.200
- THAT'S TRUE. HE DIDN'T.
- HE DIDN'T.

13:26.233 --> 13:28.600
BUT THAT'S WHY
I KEPT MY NAME OFF,

13:28.633 --> 13:30.833
BECAUSE I THINK
IT'S THE EXHIBIT.

13:30.867 --> 13:32.900
IT'S THE ISSUE THAT NEEDS
TO STAND FORWARD, NOT ME.

13:32.933 --> 13:35.100
- AND YOU'RE SO PASSIONATE
ABOUT THE ISSUE.
- THANK YOU.

13:35.133 --> 13:37.533
YOU KNOW,
TOO MANY PEOPLE

13:37.567 --> 13:38.967
DON'T DO THINGS OUT
OF THE GOODNESS--

13:39.067 --> 13:40.533
THEY WANT THE CREDIT.

13:40.567 --> 13:43.100
YOU ARE NUMBER ONE
IN MY BOOK, TED DANSON.

13:43.133 --> 13:45.100
- SENATOR.
- PLEASE DON'T FORGET--

13:45.133 --> 13:47.067
I'VE GOTTA RUN.
BYE, LARRY. BYE, TED.

13:47.067 --> 13:48.567
- SO SWEET. BYE, DARLING.
- SEE YOU LATER.

13:48.600 --> 13:49.867
- YEAH, BYE.
- RIGHT THIS WAY.

13:49.900 --> 13:53.300
WOW, WOW.

13:53.333 --> 13:56.367
- I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT.
- WHAT IS THIS BULLSHIT?

13:56.400 --> 13:58.833
- WHAT?
- ANONYMOUS.
GIVE ME A BREAK.

13:58.867 --> 14:00.800
IF YOU'RE ANONYMOUS,
HOW COME PEOPLE KNOW
ABOUT IT?

14:00.833 --> 14:02.600
I TOLD MAYBE ONE
OR TWO PEOPLE,

14:02.633 --> 14:05.233
FRIENDS THAT I
DIDN'T THINK I WANTED
TO HAVE A SECRET.

14:05.267 --> 14:07.233
I HAVE A FEELING
EVERYBODY IN THIS
ROOM KNOWS.

14:07.267 --> 14:09.667
CAN I HAVE YOUR
ATTENTION, EVERYBODY?

14:09.700 --> 14:12.667
WE'RE GONNA START
THE CEREMONY AND SENATOR
BARBARA BOXER WOULD LIKE

14:12.700 --> 14:15.467
- TO SAY A FEW WORDS.
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

14:15.500 --> 14:19.233
THIS IS A NIGHT
TO THANK TWO VERY
SPECIAL PEOPLE...

14:19.267 --> 14:22.200
- YOU KNOW, YOU'RE FULL OF SHIT.
- YOU'RE A FUCKING ASSHOLE.

14:22.233 --> 14:24.567
- SO ONE IS LARRY DAVID.
- ANONYMOUS.

14:24.600 --> 14:26.067
LARRY DAVID.

14:26.100 --> 14:29.067
WE ARE VERY THRILLED
WITH HIS CONTRIBUTION,

14:29.067 --> 14:33.467
- AND THE OTHER IS
ANONYMOUS.
- ( cheering )

14:43.233 --> 14:44.733
SO YOU KNOW NOT
ONE PERSON,

14:44.767 --> 14:48.767
NOT ONE THANKED ME
FOR THE DONATION.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.133
ARE YOU AWARE OF THAT?

14:50.167 --> 14:53.733
NEXT TIME I GIVE MONEY
TO ANYBODY

14:53.767 --> 14:56.300
IT'LL BE ANONYMOUS,
I CAN TELL YOU THAT.

14:56.333 --> 14:58.900
AND I'M GOING
TO TELL EVERYBODY.

14:58.933 --> 15:01.067
I KNOW WHO
THE MASTURBATOR WAS.

15:03.133 --> 15:04.967
JEFF.

15:09.633 --> 15:11.067
UH-HUH.

15:11.100 --> 15:14.833
- TED DANSON TOLD YOU THAT.
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.

15:14.867 --> 15:16.800
OH MY GOD.
THAT'S REALLY
UNBELIEVABLE.

15:16.833 --> 15:18.900
- YOU KNOW
WHAT'S UNBELIEVABLE?
- THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

15:18.933 --> 15:22.300
IS THAT YOUR FRIEND WOULD
THINK THAT'S IT'S OKAY

15:22.333 --> 15:24.667
TO COME OVER TO OUR HOUSE
AND JERK OFF.

15:24.700 --> 15:27.767
- HE'S HAD TOO MUCH
TO DRINK, YOU KNOW...
- TOO MUCH TO DRINK?

15:27.800 --> 15:30.400
- YEAH, HE WAS DRUNK.
- WELL I'VE HAD
DRINKS BEFORE,

15:30.433 --> 15:31.933
AND I DIDN'T GO OVER
TO SOMEBODY'S HOUSE

15:31.967 --> 15:34.700
- AND MASTURBATE
IN THE GUEST ROOM.
- WELL, GOOD FOR YOU.

15:34.733 --> 15:36.433
AND BY THE WAY,

15:36.467 --> 15:38.200
JEFF IS BANNED
FROM OUR HOUSE.

15:38.233 --> 15:40.100
- YOU'RE BANNING HIM
FROM THE HOUSE?
- YEAH.

15:40.133 --> 15:43.133
HE IS NOT WELCOME
IN OUR HOUSE ANYMORE.

15:43.167 --> 15:44.700
I TELL YOU WHAT:
I'D RATHER HAVE

15:44.733 --> 15:46.833
THE MASTURBATOR
IN THE HOUSE THAN
THE GOSSIPER.

15:46.867 --> 15:49.500
WELL, YOU OBVIOUSLY
WEREN'T GOING TO TELL
ME, LARRY.

15:49.533 --> 15:52.867
I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
ON THE WAY HOME OR WAITED
UNTIL I GOT IN THE HOUSE,

15:52.900 --> 15:55.200
- OH, RIGHT.
- SO WE'D HAVE A GOOD LAUGH
OVER IT LATER.

15:55.233 --> 15:56.567
- A LAUGH?
- WELL, WHATEVER.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.700
- DID YOU REALLY THINK--
- NO PROBABLY NOT.

15:58.733 --> 16:02.967
THAT'S HILARIOUS--
"HEY, CHERYL, GUESS WHO JERKED
OFF ON OUR BLANKET?

16:03.067 --> 16:05.733
IT WAS JEFF.
ISN'T THAT HILARIOUS?"
YEAH.

16:05.767 --> 16:07.433
YEAH, THAT'S A FUN RIDE HOME.

16:15.500 --> 16:17.267
HEYA, WHAT'S GOING ON?

16:17.300 --> 16:18.700
TCH...

16:18.733 --> 16:21.367
IT'S CRAZY, REALLY, BUT,

16:21.400 --> 16:24.100
I-- YOU KNOW. ( sighs )

16:24.133 --> 16:26.067
UM...

16:28.500 --> 16:31.967
CHERYL FOUND OUT
ABOUT THE STAIN
ON THE BLANKET.

16:32.067 --> 16:34.267
HOW COULD SHE FIND OUT?
YOU--

16:34.300 --> 16:35.533
YOU DIDN'T TELL HER.

16:35.567 --> 16:37.067
NO.

16:37.067 --> 16:38.733
TED DANSON?

16:38.767 --> 16:40.400
YEAH, HER GIRLFRIEND TED!

16:40.433 --> 16:43.433
- WHY WOULD HE DO DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

16:43.467 --> 16:45.433
- THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE!
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT!

16:45.467 --> 16:47.933
- THAT WAS A PRIVATE MOMENT!
- ABSOLUTELY.

16:47.967 --> 16:50.767
- AND THEN HE'S GOSSIPING?
- WHAT A LITTLE YENTA!

16:50.800 --> 16:52.800
THAT'S CRAZY!

16:52.833 --> 16:55.067
NOW HOW AM I GONNA
LOOK CHERYL IN THE EYE?

16:55.067 --> 16:57.333
HOW CAN THE FOUR OF US
EVER GO OUT AGAIN?

16:57.367 --> 16:59.200
THAT'S ANOTHER THING.

16:59.233 --> 17:04.067
SHE'S UH-- SHE WAS
PRETTY UPSET, AND, UH...

17:04.100 --> 17:08.333
SHE'S BANNED YOU
FROM THE HOUSE.

17:08.367 --> 17:12.300
- CHERYL BANNED ME
FROM YOUR HOUSE?
- YOU'RE BANNED.

17:12.333 --> 17:13.767
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

17:13.800 --> 17:14.767
OH, HEY, SUZ'.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.067
- LARR'.
- HI, HOW ARE YOU?

17:16.100 --> 17:17.867
WHAT DO YOU MEAN CHERYL
BANNED YOU FROM THE HOUSE?

17:17.900 --> 17:20.333
- WHO JUST SAID--?
- I HEARD YOU!

17:20.367 --> 17:23.733
DON'T TRY TO BULLSHIT ME!
WHY, WHAT HAPPENED?

17:23.767 --> 17:25.533
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN
IF I DON'T TELL?

17:25.567 --> 17:27.500
I'LL CALL CHERYL
AND FIND OUT.

17:27.533 --> 17:31.700
- WHAT THE FUCK DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE?
- WELL, OKAY.

17:31.733 --> 17:33.967
LAST PASSOVER...

17:37.067 --> 17:38.133
YOU WHAT?!

17:38.167 --> 17:40.767
YOU JERKED OFF
IN THEIR HOUSE?

17:40.800 --> 17:43.067
- YEAH.
- OH, THAT IS SICK!

17:43.067 --> 17:46.967
YOU HAVE WROUGHT YOUR SEMEN
OUTSIDE OUR HOME, JEFF?

17:47.067 --> 17:48.900
- YEAH.
- THAT'S ADULTERY!

17:48.933 --> 17:51.467
- THAT'S CHEATING ON ME!
- WHEN DID--

17:51.500 --> 17:54.567
YOU MASTURBATE IN THIS HOUSE
AND THIS HOUSE ALONE!
MAYBE A HOTEL.

17:54.600 --> 17:56.300
NOT AT A FRIEND'S HOUSE!

17:56.333 --> 17:57.900
I HAVE TO AGREE
WITH HER, REALLY.

17:57.933 --> 17:59.367
YOU KNOW WHAT, LARRY?
I CAN HANDLE THIS.

17:59.400 --> 18:00.933
HE'S MY HUSBAND.
SHUT THE FUCK UP, OKAY?

18:00.967 --> 18:02.567
- OKAY.
- IT'S SICK, JEFF!

18:02.600 --> 18:05.433
YOU DON'T JERK OFF
IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S HOME!

18:05.467 --> 18:06.967
AND CHERYL KICKED HIM OUT?

18:07.067 --> 18:09.267
- YEAH, SHE BANNED HIM.
- REALLY?

18:09.300 --> 18:12.600
WHO THE FUCK IS SHE
TO TELL MY HUSBAND
WHAT TO DO?

18:12.633 --> 18:15.233
- I PUNISH MY HUSBAND!
- I COULD NOT AGREE MORE
WITH YOU.

18:15.267 --> 18:17.067
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH, LARRY.
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:17.067 --> 18:18.767
BAN HIM FROM
THE HOUSE?

18:18.800 --> 18:21.167
- FUCK YOU, BAN HIM
FROM THE HOUSE.
- FUCK YOU, YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

18:21.200 --> 18:23.100
I WILL TAKE CARE
OF YOU IN MY OWN WAY.

18:23.133 --> 18:25.133
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
JEFF IS BANNED FROM
YOUR HOUSE?

18:25.167 --> 18:26.733
YOU ARE BANNED
FROM MY HOUSE.

18:26.767 --> 18:28.733
GET THE FUCK OUT!

18:28.767 --> 18:31.533
- WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU--
- GET THE FUCK OUT
OF MY HOUSE!

18:31.567 --> 18:33.333
BE GONE WITH YOU!
OUT!

18:33.367 --> 18:35.600
IF HE'S BANNED, YOU'RE BANNED!

18:35.633 --> 18:37.800
- YOU'RE BANNING ME?
- YES, I AM BANNING YOU.

18:37.833 --> 18:39.967
- YOU'RE BANNING ME
FROM YOUR HOUSE?
- YES I AM.

18:40.067 --> 18:43.200
- OKAY, FINE. I'M BANNED!
- GOOD!

18:43.233 --> 18:44.567
DON'T COME BACK!

18:44.600 --> 18:45.767
DON'T WORRY, I WON'T!

18:47.567 --> 18:51.067
( kids squealing, screaming )

18:51.100 --> 18:54.367
- BOO!
- IT'S A GHOST!
DON'T LET HIM GET ME!

18:54.400 --> 18:56.867
WHAT THE HELL'S
GOING ON HERE?
OH, HELL NO!

18:56.900 --> 18:58.567
- I WILL TAKE YOU OUT!
- ( screaming )

18:58.600 --> 19:01.300
THE DAYS ARE OVER WHERE YOU
BEEN TERRORIZING MY PEOPLE!

19:01.333 --> 19:03.700
- IT'S ME!
- ME WHO?

19:03.733 --> 19:07.267
LARRY DAVID!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
UP UNDER THIS KLAN SHEET?

19:07.300 --> 19:09.300
- WHAT?
- MM-HMM.

19:09.333 --> 19:10.633
OH MY GOD, NO NO NO.

19:10.667 --> 19:12.600
- WE WERE PLAYING GHOSTS.
- GHOSTS?

19:12.633 --> 19:14.800
WHERE I COME FROM,
YOU SEE SOMEBODY
IN A SHEET,

19:14.833 --> 19:16.867
GHOST IS NOT THE FIRST
THING YOU THINK ABOUT.

19:16.900 --> 19:18.633
YOU THINK ABOUT K.K.K.

19:18.667 --> 19:20.433
- K.K.K.?
- YEAH.

19:20.467 --> 19:22.867
( laughs )
COME ON, ARE YOU KIDDING?

19:22.900 --> 19:25.567
SCARED ME
HALF TO DEATH, LARRY.

19:25.600 --> 19:27.533
OKAY, YOU CAN GET OFF NOW.

19:27.567 --> 19:30.200
- ALL RIGHT. WELL,
HELP ME, LOVE.
- GO AHEAD.

19:31.900 --> 19:33.667
I'LL GET THESE GROCERIES...

19:33.700 --> 19:35.900
HEY, JEFF'S SUNGLASSES.

19:39.800 --> 19:42.867
- HEY, LEON!
- WHAT UP?

19:42.900 --> 19:45.200
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU WANT TO TAKE A RIDE
WITH ME?

19:45.233 --> 19:48.233
I GOTTA RETURN
JEFF'S SUNGLASSES.
HE LEFT THEM HERE.

19:48.267 --> 19:49.700
I GOT SOME STUFF
TO TELL YOU ANYWAY.

19:49.733 --> 19:51.167
ALL RIGHT, LARRY.
HOLD ON.

19:51.200 --> 19:52.933
GIVE ME TWO MINUTES, LARRY.

19:57.433 --> 20:00.300
HO HO HO! SO IT'S
JEFF BEEN JACKIN' OFF?

20:00.333 --> 20:02.367
THAT'S THE
JACKOFF SUSPECT, HUH?

20:02.400 --> 20:04.267
YEAH.
LEON, I AM SO SORRY.

20:04.300 --> 20:06.333
THAT'S SOME FUCKED-UP SHIT
RIGHT THERE, MAN.

20:06.367 --> 20:08.867
I KNOW. I OWE YOU ONE.

20:08.900 --> 20:10.367
YOU DAMN RIGHT
YOU OWE ME ONE.

20:10.400 --> 20:12.600
- OKAY, SO WE'RE COOL?
- WE'RE COOL, MAN.

20:12.633 --> 20:15.400
OKAY.
HEY, LEON...

20:15.433 --> 20:17.733
- YOU SEE THAT GUY?
- THAT GUY RIGHT THERE?

20:17.767 --> 20:19.533
Larry:
IN THE YANKEE JERSEY.

20:19.567 --> 20:22.733
NUMBER 25-- THAT'S
MY JERSEY! JOE PEPITONE!

20:22.767 --> 20:23.833
- WHAT?
- THE DRY CLEANER
GAVE IT TO HIM.

20:23.867 --> 20:25.000
HE NEVER GAVE IT BACK.

20:25.033 --> 20:26.767
THAT'S SOME BULLSHIT
RIGHT THERE.

20:26.800 --> 20:29.433
- I'M GOING TO
HANDLE THIS SHIT.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:29.467 --> 20:32.767
- I'M GONNA GET YOUR
SHIT BACK FOR YOU, MAN.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

20:32.800 --> 20:34.600
BE COOL, LARRY.
I'M GONNA GET THAT
SHIT BACK FOR YOU.

20:34.633 --> 20:36.733
LEON!

20:59.033 --> 21:00.400
YEAH!

21:00.433 --> 21:03.600
( laughing ) YEAH,
THAT'S HOW I DO IT, BABY!

21:03.633 --> 21:05.867
HA HA HA!
JOE PEPITONE UP
IN THIS MOTHERFUCKER.

21:05.900 --> 21:07.833
JESUS.
NICE GOIN', MAN.

21:07.867 --> 21:09.400
- THAT'S HOW I DOOS IT, BABY.
- NICE GOING.

21:09.433 --> 21:12.767
- THAT'S HOW I
DOOS IT, LARRY.
- I LIKE IT.

21:18.700 --> 21:21.133
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

21:23.300 --> 21:26.367
JEFF'S GLASSES.

21:26.400 --> 21:27.933
FOUND THEM IN MY HOUSE.

21:27.967 --> 21:29.900
HE MENTIONED IT TO ME
SO I THOUGHT I'D RETURN THEM.

21:29.933 --> 21:31.700
ALL RIGHT, FINE,
THANK YOU.

21:31.733 --> 21:35.867
- UM... I KNOW I'M BANNED
FROM THE HOUSE AND ALL--
- YEAH?

21:35.900 --> 21:37.767
THINK I COULD USE
YOUR BATHROOM?

21:37.800 --> 21:40.633
NO, A BAN IS A BAN.
WHAT, DOES MY WORD
MEAN NOTHING?

21:40.667 --> 21:42.100
I REALLY GOTTA GO.

21:45.100 --> 21:47.767
ALL RIGHT, I WILL
TEMPORARILY LIFT
THE BAN.

21:47.800 --> 21:48.767
IN OUT-- QUICK!

21:48.800 --> 21:50.433
BEAUTIFUL.
THANK YOU.

21:50.467 --> 21:52.200
- ( thumps )
- WHAT THE FUCK?!

21:52.233 --> 21:54.233
OW!
( groans )

21:54.267 --> 21:56.500
- IT WAS A PLAYFUL TAP!
- WHAT ARE YOU,
NINE YEARS OLD

21:56.533 --> 21:59.633
IN FOURTH GRADE?
GET YOUR FUCKIN' HANDS
OFF OF ME!

21:59.667 --> 22:02.100
( groans )

22:02.133 --> 22:04.200
- IT WAS A PLAYFUL TAP.
- GET IN AND OUT!

22:07.067 --> 22:08.700
Leon: SO WHAT ARE WE
GONNA DO NOW,

22:08.733 --> 22:10.833
GET ME A NEW BLANKET,
NEW BED, ALL THAT SHIT?

22:10.867 --> 22:12.367
LEON, I'M NOT
GETTING YOU A NEW BED.

22:12.400 --> 22:14.100
COME ON, MAN.
THAT'S CRAZY.

22:14.133 --> 22:15.633
THAT'S CRAZY RIGHT THERE.

22:15.667 --> 22:18.900
- THAT MATTRESS IS TAINTED!
- HEY, WAIT A SECOND.

22:18.933 --> 22:21.800
OH MY GOD!
THERE'S ANOTHER
JOE PEPITONE JERSEY!

22:21.833 --> 22:23.200
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

22:23.233 --> 22:25.233
IS IT POSSIBLE THERE'S
TWO OF THESE THINGS?

22:25.267 --> 22:27.900
- CAN'T BE TWO.
- LET ME CHECK THE SIZE.

22:29.333 --> 22:31.333
- 44.
- 44?

22:31.367 --> 22:32.367
NO, MINE'S 42.

22:32.400 --> 22:35.633
THIS CAN'T BE MY JERSEY.
THAT'S MY JERSEY.

22:35.667 --> 22:39.333
OKAY, WELL LET'S GET
THE RIGHT SHIRT THEN.
HOW 'BOUT THAT?

22:39.367 --> 22:41.867
ALL RIGHT, I CAN HANDLE THAT
RIGHT NOW.

22:59.833 --> 23:01.633
THAT GUY RIGHT THERE.
IT'S HIS SHIRT.

23:01.667 --> 23:05.100
WE'RE DEFINITELY TAKING
THE DAMN SHIRT.

23:05.133 --> 23:07.100
- LARRY?
- HUH?

23:07.133 --> 23:09.100
LARRY DAVID?
HEY HEY HEY.

23:09.133 --> 23:11.100
HEY, IT'S MERLE--
MERLE BERGER

23:11.133 --> 23:12.733
FROM THE N.R.D.C. FUNCTION
THE OTHER NIGHT.

23:12.767 --> 23:15.067
OH, MERLE!
HEY!

23:15.100 --> 23:18.633
HEY, DID YOU SEND
THAT GUY OVER TO TAKE
MY JERSEY?

23:18.667 --> 23:20.967
WELL, I DIDN'T REALLY
SEND HIM.

23:21.067 --> 23:22.933
HE KIND OF WENT OFF
ON HIS OWN.

23:22.967 --> 23:25.700
HE JUST TOOK THE JERSEY
OFF MY BACK!

23:25.733 --> 23:27.767
I DON'T THINK IT'S
REALLY YOUR JERSEY,
THOUGH, IS IT, MERLE?

23:27.800 --> 23:29.767
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I WAS WEARING IT.

23:29.800 --> 23:32.200
DID YOU GET THAT JERSEY
FROM THE DRY CLEANER?

23:32.233 --> 23:35.233
YEAH, I GOT IT--
I GOT IT FROM THE DRY CLEANER.

23:35.267 --> 23:37.333
OKAY, MERLE, THAT JERSEY
IS MY JERSEY.

23:37.367 --> 23:40.633
I BROUGHT IT INTO
THAT DRY CLEANER AND THEY
GAVE IT TO YOU BY MISTAKE.

23:40.667 --> 23:43.400
- BUT YOU DIDN'T RETURN IT.
- YEAH, BUT THAT'S THE LAW
OF THE DRY CLEANERS.

23:43.433 --> 23:45.067
YOU KNOW, YOU WIN SOME,
YOU LOSE SOME.

23:45.067 --> 23:47.367
- THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS.
- THAT DOESN'T WORK OUT
WITH ME.

23:47.400 --> 23:48.967
I NEVER GET ANY STUFF
FROM THE DRY CLEANER.

23:49.067 --> 23:51.100
THE ONLY MISTAKES THEY MAKE
WITH ME ARE TO GIVE MY STUFF
TO OTHER PEOPLE.

23:51.133 --> 23:53.067
THAT'S NOT MY FAULT.
I'VE LOST TONS OF STUFF

23:53.067 --> 23:54.767
AT THE DRY CLEANERS.
I LOST DRAPES!

23:54.800 --> 23:57.167
WELL, I'M SORRY FOR
YOUR LOSSES BUT YOU'RE
NOT GONNA MAKE IT UP NOW.

23:57.200 --> 23:58.833
IF YOU GOT A PROBLEM
WITH THIS

23:58.867 --> 24:01.367
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
WRITE YOUR CONGRESSPERSON?

24:01.400 --> 24:03.700
YEAH, WELL I SPOKE
TO SENATOR BOXER.
HOW ABOUT THAT?

24:03.733 --> 24:05.467
OH, THAT'S GREAT.
AND WHAT DID SHE SAY?

24:06.667 --> 24:08.100
SHE SAID...

24:08.133 --> 24:11.700
THAT SHE'S GONNA GO TO
WASHINGTON AND TAKE CARE
OF THIS PROBLEM.

24:11.733 --> 24:14.700
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

24:14.733 --> 24:16.367
I'M ON THE BOARD AT THE N.R.D.C.

24:16.400 --> 24:17.900
AND YOUR NAME'S
COMING OFF THAT WALL.

24:17.933 --> 24:19.600
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE THAT?

24:19.633 --> 24:21.267
YOU'RE GONNA
TAKE MY NAME
OFF THE WALL?

24:21.300 --> 24:23.700
- YEAH, I'M GONNA--
- NO! YOU WOULDN'T.

24:23.733 --> 24:25.200
OH, YOU BET I WOULD.

24:25.233 --> 24:27.167
- OKAY, GO AHEAD, DO IT.
- I'M GONNA DO IT!

24:27.200 --> 24:28.933
AND WHY DON'T YOU
PUT UP "ANONYMOUS"
INSTEAD?

24:28.967 --> 24:30.867
I WILL.
THAT'S A PERFECT IDEA.

24:30.900 --> 24:33.133
- YEAH, REALLY?
GO AHEAD AND DO IT.
- I HAVE A LOT OF PULL.

24:33.167 --> 24:34.500
- OKAY, LET'S SEE.
- GOOD.

24:34.533 --> 24:35.867
YOU COME BY THERE
NEXT MONDAY,

24:35.900 --> 24:37.567
IT'S GONNA SAY "ANONYMOUS"
ON THE WALL.

24:37.600 --> 24:40.600
- OKAY, GOOD!
DON'T FORGET.
- I'M NOT!

24:42.767 --> 24:46.067
Leon: OKAY.
JOE PEPITONE!
( laughs )

24:46.067 --> 24:47.567
WE GOT A MATCHING SET, MAN.

24:52.900 --> 24:55.233
( screaming )

24:55.267 --> 24:56.733
MOM!

24:56.767 --> 24:59.100
WHAT'S WRONG,
SAMMY, DARLING?

25:01.300 --> 25:05.100
Leon: MMM! BAM!

25:05.133 --> 25:06.333
BAM!

25:06.367 --> 25:07.367
- WAR.
- WAR.

25:07.400 --> 25:09.767
( together )
I DECLARE WAR!

25:09.800 --> 25:10.767
BOOM! AW!

25:10.800 --> 25:12.400
ALL RIGHT!
WHAT'D I GET?

25:12.433 --> 25:14.200
TAKE IT.
PEANUT, GRAB THAT DOOR!

25:14.233 --> 25:15.600
GET THE DOOR, PEANUT!

25:15.633 --> 25:17.567
I JUST WANT TO DO
MY THING, LARRY.

25:17.600 --> 25:19.233
WHAT IS YOUR THING?

25:19.267 --> 25:20.967
I'M GONNA BE
A DIRECTOR, MAN--

25:21.067 --> 25:22.700
ACTION MOVIES,
ALL THAT STUFF, MAN.

25:22.733 --> 25:24.467
Larry:
YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T JUST
GO RIGHT INTO THAT.

25:24.500 --> 25:27.567
YOU GOTTA GET SOMETHING
IN PRODUCTION, YOU
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

25:27.600 --> 25:29.300
Leon:
OH. OH, MAN.

25:30.567 --> 25:32.900
THIS IS A NEW LOW,
EVEN FOR YOU, LARRY.

25:32.933 --> 25:34.067
HUH?

25:34.067 --> 25:37.400
YOU CAME OVER YESTERDAY,
YOU WENT TO THE BATHROOM

25:37.433 --> 25:39.833
AND YOU CHOKED IT
ON SAMMY'S TEDDY BEAR

25:39.867 --> 25:43.500
AS SOME KIND OF REVENGE
MASTURBATORY PAYBACK!

25:43.533 --> 25:46.933
- OKAY, I DIDN'T DO THAT--
- OH, BULLSHIT! YOU'RE
A FUCKING LIAR!

25:46.967 --> 25:48.067
- WHAT, I DID THAT?
- YES YOU DID!

25:48.067 --> 25:49.067
Larry: ARE YOU CRAZY?

25:49.067 --> 25:50.933
IT'S THAT JACKALIT,
RIGHT?

25:50.967 --> 25:52.433
WHO THE FUCK IS THIS?

25:52.467 --> 25:54.067
THAT'S LEON,
LORETTA'S BROTHER.

25:54.100 --> 25:56.100
WHAT'S UP WHAT'S UP,
WHAT'S UP WHAT'S UP?
MMM.

25:56.133 --> 25:59.233
I TELL YOU ONE THING: I LIKE
A WOMAN WITH A SMART-ASS MOUTH
LIKE THAT.

25:59.267 --> 26:01.233
- YEAH, WELL FUCK YOU TOO!
- MMM. YOU HANDLE YOURSELF.

26:01.267 --> 26:03.833
THAT'S BESIDE
THE POINT, LEON.
THIS IS SICK,

26:03.867 --> 26:07.267
THIS IS PERVERSE,
AND I THINK THIS IS
THE LOWEST YOU'VE EVER GONE.

26:07.300 --> 26:09.733
- COME ON, I DIDN'T DO THAT.
- OH REALLY, THEN WHO DID?

26:09.767 --> 26:12.500
- I DON'T KNOW.
- JUST SOME ANONYMOUS PERSON?

26:12.533 --> 26:14.067
WHO'S ANONYMOUS, THEN?

26:14.067 --> 26:17.533
- Cheryl: OH, I KNOW
WHO ANONYMOUS IS.
- WHO?

26:17.567 --> 26:20.100
- IT'S TED DANSON.
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?

26:20.133 --> 26:22.500
WELL, HE TOLD ME,
BUT HE TOLD ME NOT
TO TELL ANYBODY.

26:22.533 --> 26:25.400
THAT'S HOW HE LIKES TO DO IT.
MAKES HIM FEEL BETTER
ABOUT HIMSELF.

26:26.400 --> 26:27.933
DANSON?!

26:27.967 --> 26:29.700
OH, THAT'S DISGUSTING!

26:29.733 --> 26:31.900
THAT IS JUST DISGUSTING!

26:31.933 --> 26:34.600
WHAT A PERV, MAN!
ACTORS!

26:34.633 --> 26:37.600
- ( door slams )
- BOOM! WAR.

26:37.633 --> 26:39.667
( together )
I DECLARE--

26:39.700 --> 26:40.667
- BOOM!
- --WAR.

26:41.733 --> 26:45.933
( classical music playing )

26:45.967 --> 26:47.367
( doorbell rings )

26:47.400 --> 26:48.633
I'LL GET IT.

27:00.100 --> 27:02.467
TED, IT'S SUZIE FOR YOU.

27:02.500 --> 27:05.500
I WONDER WHAT SHE WANTS.

27:11.067 --> 27:13.433
- HEY, LARR, HOW ARE YOU?
- HI KATHY.

27:13.467 --> 27:15.433
- HOW ARE YOU DOING, MAN?
- GOOD.

27:15.467 --> 27:19.067
HEY, I WANTED TO TELL YOU
I HEARD THAT YOU TOOK YOUR
NAME OFF THE NRDC BUILDING

27:19.067 --> 27:21.333
AND HAD IT REPLACED
WITH ANONYMOUS.

27:21.367 --> 27:25.067
I THINK IT'S SO WONDERFUL.
I ADMIRE YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT.

27:25.067 --> 27:28.967
KATHY, I GET PLENTY OF FANFARE.
I DON'T NEED THE FANFARE,
YOU KNOW?

27:29.067 --> 27:30.200
- GOOD FOR YOU, LARRY.
- I REALLY DON'T.

27:30.233 --> 27:32.300
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND

27:32.333 --> 27:36.067
THAT I TOLD A FEW PEOPLE
THAT YOU WERE THE ANONYMOUS
PERSON.

27:36.100 --> 27:39.067
I HOPE THAT'S OKAY
THAT I LET THAT SLIP OUT.

27:39.100 --> 27:41.833
WELL, I CAN'T REALLY
TELL YOU WHAT TO DO,
BUT I-- YEAH...

27:41.867 --> 27:43.733
PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW
YOU'RE ANONYMOUS.

27:43.767 --> 27:46.300
- YOU'RE A GREAT GUY, LARRY--
- WELL, IF YOU WANT TO
TELL PEOPLE GO AHEAD.

27:46.333 --> 27:49.067
- YOU KNOW, IT'S UP TO YOU.
- I HAVE ALREADY AND I
MIGHT CONTINUE.

27:49.100 --> 27:51.933
- CONTINUE AWAY.
- ALL RIGHT, I WILL.

27:51.967 --> 27:53.400
- THANK YOU.
- TAKE CARE, HONEY.

27:53.433 --> 27:54.767
