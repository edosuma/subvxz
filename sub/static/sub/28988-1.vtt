I swear.

01:51.850 --> 01:54.157

01:54.201 --> 01:55.898

Where are you?

- It's family time.

02:14.612 --> 02:16.397
I didn't want to intrude.
- This again?

02:16.440 --> 02:17.963
I mean, Christ, we went over
this a million times.

02:18.007 --> 02:19.878
- No, it's not about that.
I like the fresh air.

02:19.922 --> 02:22.751

- Yeah, I do.

- Nothing.
- Bullshit, I know you.

02:38.375 --> 02:39.985
You got a bug up your ass.
I wanna know what it is.

02:40.029 --> 02:42.162
- It's this Pearson woman.

02:43.554 --> 02:45.513
- What about her?
- You don't know her, Bobby.

02:45.556 --> 02:47.950
- I know she was smart enough
to get Pat McGann by the balls.

02:47.993 --> 02:49.821
- I'm serious.
Don't bring her inside.

02:49.865 --> 02:51.301
Find out
what she wants and--

02:51.345 --> 02:53.216
- I've given her
what she wants.

02:53.260 --> 02:55.000
I run a big city here,
all right?

02:55.044 --> 02:57.220
I know what I'm doing.

02:57.264 --> 02:59.657
What are you worried about?
- I worry, okay?

02:59.701 --> 03:01.833
It's my job
to take care of you.

03:01.877 --> 03:03.008
- Your job's to get me
to Stan's

03:03.052 --> 03:04.488
before they run out of glazed.

03:04.532 --> 03:05.794
- You're an asshole.

03:05.837 --> 03:07.361
- I was gonna
say treat yourself, but...

03:08.710 --> 03:10.407
Let's get out of here.

03:17.719 --> 03:19.764
This is a nice way
to start the day.

03:19.808 --> 03:20.983
- Mm-hmm.

03:21.026 --> 03:23.028
Doesn't have to end here.
- Mm.

03:23.072 --> 03:25.335
- I've earned myself
a few sick days.

03:27.685 --> 03:30.732
I haven't.

03:39.567 --> 03:42.265
- You are really doing this.
- Jeff.

03:42.309 --> 03:43.701
- I'm not looking for a fight,
Jessica.

03:43.745 --> 03:45.660
I'm trying to have
your back.

03:45.703 --> 03:48.706
- You had all weekend
to have my back.

03:48.750 --> 03:50.882
Dropping this on me when
I'm on my way out the door,

03:50.926 --> 03:52.406
that's a fight.

03:52.449 --> 03:53.798
- I gave you the weekend
because I thought that

03:53.842 --> 03:55.365
you would come to your senses.

03:55.409 --> 03:56.845
- You know, I made a promise
to my father.

03:56.888 --> 03:58.760
- To reconnect
with your family,

03:58.803 --> 04:00.718
not work
for a professional liar.

04:00.762 --> 04:02.720
- All politicians are
professional liars.

04:02.764 --> 04:04.592
At least this way, I can
actually help my family.

04:04.635 --> 04:06.811
- Oh, Jessica.
- Well, don't you get it?

04:06.855 --> 04:09.727
I spent years doing nothing but
making money

04:09.771 --> 04:11.816
and fighting to keep my name
up on a wall.

04:11.860 --> 04:13.514
My life needs to be about more.

04:13.557 --> 04:15.777
- And it has nothing to do
with you missing the action.

04:15.820 --> 04:18.562
- You know what? For a man who
doesn't want to start a fight,

04:18.606 --> 04:19.781
you're doing a lousy job.

04:19.824 --> 04:21.565
- Jessica, wait.

04:21.609 --> 04:22.958
I'm sorry.

04:23.001 --> 04:24.438
This is the last thing
that I wanted.

04:24.481 --> 04:25.743
- No, I know what you wanted.

04:25.787 --> 04:27.745
You thought you'd tell me
about some rumor

04:27.789 --> 04:29.312
that your friend
at Justice heard

04:29.356 --> 04:30.574
and then I'd just forget
about the whole thing.

04:30.618 --> 04:32.402
- It is not a rumor.

04:32.446 --> 04:33.882
The man who went up against
the city was found murdered.

04:33.925 --> 04:35.710
- If your friend
knows something,

04:35.753 --> 04:36.798
tell him to show you.

04:36.841 --> 04:38.582
- I can't go to him now.

04:38.626 --> 04:40.758
You're about to be the mayor's
brand new right hand.

04:40.802 --> 04:43.370
I live with you
and that makes me a part of it.

04:43.413 --> 04:44.893
- Oh, so that's
what this is about.

04:44.936 --> 04:46.503
- No, don't make me
the bad guy.

04:46.547 --> 04:48.940
- You are allowed
to look out for yourself, Jeff.

04:48.984 --> 04:50.899
I wouldn't want to be
with a man that didn't,

04:50.942 --> 04:52.770
but you're going
to have to decide

04:52.814 --> 04:54.903
whether or not you want
to be a part of this.

04:54.946 --> 04:58.776
Because like it or not,
I'm taking that job,

04:58.820 --> 05:03.041
and I won't have the same
conversation every morning.

05:09.787 --> 05:11.311
- Ms. Pearson.

05:12.355 --> 05:13.617
- City Hall, ma'am.

05:13.661 --> 05:15.358
- Just drive.

05:34.638 --> 05:36.814
- This is stupid.

05:36.858 --> 05:39.600
Can I go, please?
- No, you can't.

05:39.643 --> 05:41.950
They still have to get your
blood sugar up, so sit still.

05:44.126 --> 05:46.476
- You're creeping me out, lady.

05:47.738 --> 05:49.174
- Jessica,
what are you doing here?

05:49.218 --> 05:51.612
- Can I talk to you?
It'll just take a minute.

05:54.397 --> 05:56.399
- In case you haven't noticed,
this is an emergency room.

05:56.443 --> 05:57.792
So unless it's an emergency--

05:57.835 --> 05:59.141
- I'm dropping
your mother's lawsuit.

05:59.184 --> 06:00.795
- What do you mean
you're dropping it?

06:00.838 --> 06:03.406
- The mayor offered me a job
if I let it go

06:03.450 --> 06:04.755
and I'm taking it.

06:04.799 --> 06:06.496
I just wanted
to be straight with you.

06:06.540 --> 06:08.933
- Wow, you're not even trying
to soft peddle it, are you?

06:08.977 --> 06:10.935
- Angela, please.
- Please, what?

06:10.979 --> 06:12.720
That poor girl's starving
herself out at Franklin

06:12.763 --> 06:14.678
and you walk in to tell me
you're selling us out

06:14.722 --> 06:15.766
to further your career?

06:15.810 --> 06:17.638
- Franklin?

06:17.681 --> 06:20.162
- The strike?
The hunger strike?

06:21.163 --> 06:22.773
What do you want with me,
Jessica?

06:22.817 --> 06:24.558
- All I want is for you
to listen to why.

06:24.601 --> 06:26.037
- Well, I don't have time
to listen

06:26.081 --> 06:27.865
'cause while you're out here
cutting yourself a deal,

06:27.909 --> 06:29.737
I have to find my family
a place to live.

06:29.780 --> 06:31.826
- We could've dragged
that lawsuit out for months,

06:31.869 --> 06:34.002
when it was over,
we were going to lose.

06:34.045 --> 06:35.656
I take this job,

06:35.699 --> 06:38.006
I can do more than just save
one housing project.

06:38.049 --> 06:39.660
- Do more?

06:39.703 --> 06:41.705
You don't even know what's
going on down the street.

06:42.750 --> 06:45.143
Look, I didn't expect you
to do this thing for us

06:45.187 --> 06:47.189
in the first place,
but my mother,

06:47.232 --> 06:48.886
she put her hopes in you.

06:48.930 --> 06:50.932
She may put on a brave face,
but trust me,

06:50.975 --> 06:52.803
the minute you left,
she cried her eyes out.

06:54.979 --> 06:57.634
Shit, you didn't even tell her.

06:57.678 --> 06:59.157
- I'm going to. I'm--
- Uh-uh.

06:59.201 --> 07:00.594
I see what's going on here.

07:00.637 --> 07:02.160
You're hoping that
I'd tell her for you?

07:02.204 --> 07:04.554
Let me tell you something,
cousin,

07:04.598 --> 07:06.991
I do enough dirty work
around here.

07:07.035 --> 07:08.689
You have to do that yourself.

07:21.963 --> 07:24.269
- Hold up, big guy.
Not so fast.

07:24.313 --> 07:26.794
Lunch with Local 19.

07:26.837 --> 07:27.969
We have to talk
about messaging.

07:28.012 --> 07:29.492
- What's the message?

07:29.536 --> 07:30.580
All they're going to do
is bust my balls

07:30.624 --> 07:31.973
about the docks drying up.

07:32.016 --> 07:33.540
- Hey, I've been saying
we should start talks

07:33.583 --> 07:34.932
to upgrade the Port.

07:34.976 --> 07:36.499
- What are you,
my policy guy now too?

07:36.543 --> 07:39.763
- Maybe I should be.
- Oh.

07:39.807 --> 07:42.592
Okay fine,
that's what we'll tell them.

07:42.636 --> 07:44.507
- You're not serious.
- Hey, you sold me.

07:44.551 --> 07:45.943
They won't know what
we're talking about

07:45.987 --> 07:47.510
and it'll buy us time.

07:47.554 --> 07:49.512
- So now we're lying
to the Longshoremen.

07:49.556 --> 07:51.819
- Hey, Derrick, you do know the
tooth fairy was your dad, right?

07:51.862 --> 07:53.516
- I'm just saying,
instead of bullshitting them,

07:53.560 --> 07:55.823
how about we actually
upgrade the ports?

07:55.866 --> 07:57.128
I mean, at this rate,
the unions will be dead in--

07:57.172 --> 07:59.000
- Your point's been made.
What else?

07:59.043 --> 08:01.132
- The press found out your
buses have been delayed again,

08:01.176 --> 08:02.656
and they're pushing me
for a statement.

08:02.699 --> 08:04.309
- God damn it!
- You can't blame them.

08:04.353 --> 08:06.268
You told them you'd be fully
electric by the end of last year

08:06.311 --> 08:08.270
and now nearly half the old
fleet is either broken down--

08:08.313 --> 08:10.098
- Or off the road,
I'm aware.

08:10.141 --> 08:12.796
Just figure out what to say.
Don't make me look stupid.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.145
- You look stupid?
Never.

08:14.189 --> 08:16.757
- Let me and Keri have a minute.
- Derrick.

08:19.847 --> 08:21.283
- You guys are going to be
the death of me.

08:21.326 --> 08:22.763
- You love him.

08:22.806 --> 08:25.200
- Yeah, well,
I'm not gonna tell him that.

08:28.246 --> 08:30.118
What's going on
with the buses, Keri?

08:30.161 --> 08:33.077
I'm taking a beating here.
- You know what's going on.

08:33.121 --> 08:35.036
Nivens is an asshole
and he's flexing his muscles

08:35.079 --> 08:38.082
'cause you didn't give him
the Lansing contract.

08:38.126 --> 08:39.562
- You have too much
on your plate.

08:39.606 --> 08:40.955
- I know what I can handle.

08:40.998 --> 08:42.565
- A city attorney
who burns out after a year

08:42.609 --> 08:43.566
doesn't do me any good.

08:43.610 --> 08:45.307
- I'm not gonna burn out.

08:45.350 --> 08:46.830
I'm gonna get this done for you
like I do everything else.

08:46.874 --> 08:48.049
- I'm not saying you won't.

08:48.092 --> 08:49.224
I'm just saying
maybe Jessica Pearson

08:49.267 --> 08:50.355
can make some headway.

08:50.399 --> 08:53.228
That's funny.

08:55.665 --> 08:57.624
Oh, my God,
you're not kidding.

08:57.667 --> 08:59.060
- I'm not.

09:00.627 --> 09:02.759
- Since when did she
do anything for you?

09:02.803 --> 09:03.934
- Look, I know
you don't like her

09:03.978 --> 09:05.762
but she ran
a huge New York firm.

09:05.806 --> 09:08.243
She's got skills and free time
and she wants back in the game.

09:08.286 --> 09:09.940
- This is crazy!
She's going to work for you

09:09.984 --> 09:11.333
while she has a lawsuit
against the city?

09:11.376 --> 09:12.856
- There is no lawsuit
against the city.

09:12.900 --> 09:14.162
- There was as of yesterday.

09:14.205 --> 09:16.077
- There is no lawsuit.

09:19.602 --> 09:21.822
- Well...

09:21.865 --> 09:23.737
I don't know
what you expect from me.

09:23.780 --> 09:25.608
- I expect you both
to be professional.

09:25.652 --> 09:27.610
- How is that going to work?
I took her law license for you.

09:27.654 --> 09:29.090
- You took her license for you.

09:29.133 --> 09:31.962
- Regardless, she knows
I'm the one that took it

09:32.006 --> 09:35.009
and she accused me
of sleeping with you.

09:37.359 --> 09:39.666
Nothing?
Okay, is that it?

09:39.709 --> 09:42.190
- Keri.
- Is that it?

09:43.670 --> 09:45.280
- That's it.

09:45.323 --> 09:48.152
I just didn't want you to be
blindsided, that's all.

09:48.196 --> 09:51.155
Just stay in your lane,
I'm sure she'll stay in hers.

09:53.288 --> 09:56.944
- They've taught us that
the kids don't matter!

09:56.987 --> 09:58.859
We need to tell them that we do!

09:58.902 --> 10:00.861
We do matter,
our teachers matter,

10:00.904 --> 10:02.732
and our children matter!

10:04.125 --> 10:06.780
- Let me out of here.
- Save our kids!

10:06.823 --> 10:08.956
- It's not just our schools
we're fighting for.

10:08.999 --> 10:11.175
There's at least 20 others
on the chopping block

10:11.219 --> 10:13.830
and all from the West
and South sides.

10:13.874 --> 10:16.006
- The low-income neighborhoods.
- Mm-hmm.

10:16.050 --> 10:18.835
City says it's because
of poor performance,

10:18.879 --> 10:20.663
but how are our kids
supposed to perform

10:20.707 --> 10:22.099
when they've been letting
our schools rot

10:22.143 --> 10:23.274
for the last 30 years.

10:23.318 --> 10:24.928
- But what about
your local alderman?

10:24.972 --> 10:27.278
He must be fighting to save it.
- Miss Sell-Out?

10:27.322 --> 10:29.759
All she talks about
is trying to privatize.

10:29.803 --> 10:31.282
She doesn't give a damn
about anybody but herself

10:31.326 --> 10:33.067
and her fat cat donors.

10:33.110 --> 10:34.677
- Well, if that's the case,
then she probably doesn't care

10:34.721 --> 10:37.158
about that young girl
that collapsed this morning.

10:37.201 --> 10:38.899
- I'm sure she doesn't.
What's your point?

10:38.942 --> 10:40.422
- My point is,

10:40.465 --> 10:42.685
this is all well and good,

10:42.729 --> 10:44.644
but it doesn't get you
a seat at the table.

10:46.863 --> 10:49.257
- Who did you say
you were again?

10:49.300 --> 10:50.998
You ain't from around here,
that much I know.

10:51.041 --> 10:52.956
- Oh, what if I told you
I work for the mayor?

10:54.828 --> 10:57.700
- If you do, I would tell
you both to go to hell.

10:57.744 --> 10:59.789
His child has a school.

10:59.833 --> 11:02.009
If this plan goes through
city council, mine won't.

11:13.542 --> 11:17.111
- ♪ Oh, there's a shakedown
in my town ♪

11:17.154 --> 11:20.941
♪ Said I cannot make it

11:21.942 --> 11:25.728
♪ Come a long ways

11:25.772 --> 11:27.817
- Which floor is the mayor on?
- Fifth floor.

11:27.861 --> 11:28.992
- Thanks.

11:30.341 --> 11:34.084
- ♪ They want to crucify me

11:34.128 --> 11:37.348
♪ For being a believer

11:38.480 --> 11:42.005
♪ Sometimes I see
what they see ♪

11:45.922 --> 11:47.358
- Granted, it's not
a New York law firm,

11:47.402 --> 11:49.143
but it's the best we had.

11:49.186 --> 11:50.361
- If I'd wanted
a view of the park,

11:50.405 --> 11:51.841
I'd have stayed
in corporate law.

11:51.885 --> 11:53.190
- You're late, Ms. Pearson.

11:53.234 --> 11:54.322
- Would you like to know why?

11:54.365 --> 11:56.019
- I have a feeling I don't.

11:56.063 --> 11:57.368
- I'm late
because I paid a visit

11:57.412 --> 11:59.109
to one of the schools
you're shutting down.

11:59.153 --> 12:01.242
- If you're talking about
what's going on at Franklin,

12:01.285 --> 12:03.026
that's a decision
the City Council's making

12:03.070 --> 12:04.767
based on budgetary concerns.

12:04.811 --> 12:06.508
- And that's a bullshit line
a politician gives

12:06.551 --> 12:08.423
when he knows he's on
the wrong side of an issue.

12:10.251 --> 12:12.122
- You're going to learn
pretty quickly around there

12:12.166 --> 12:14.777
that issues are often less
important than relationships.

12:14.821 --> 12:16.431
- Alderman Coats.
- See?

12:16.474 --> 12:18.346
You're a quick study.
- Oh, I did the math.

12:18.389 --> 12:20.957
You need her allegiance,
she needs her big-money backers

12:21.001 --> 12:24.482
and when they tell her to jump,
you say how high.

12:24.526 --> 12:27.311
- Debbie Coats is a friend
and an ally

12:27.355 --> 12:29.487
and right now,
I need all the allies I can get.

12:29.531 --> 12:31.881
- Even if that ally is
selling out the black community?

12:31.925 --> 12:33.578
- No one's selling anyone out

12:33.622 --> 12:35.580
and the strike'll blow over.

12:35.624 --> 12:39.410
In the meantime, try focusing
on what I brought you in to do.

12:39.454 --> 12:41.238
- Electric buses.

12:41.282 --> 12:42.805
Hmm, can't wait to dig in.

12:42.849 --> 12:44.198
- It might not be as sexy

12:44.241 --> 12:46.113
as a good old fashioned
hunger strike

12:46.156 --> 12:48.550
but it affects a hell of a lot
more people on the south side

12:48.593 --> 12:51.074
than whether Franklin
High School stays open.

12:51.118 --> 12:54.599
And right now,
this is what I want.

12:54.643 --> 12:58.386
- In that case, I look forward
to getting up to speed.

12:58.429 --> 13:00.083
- Way to tie in
the bus motif.

13:00.127 --> 13:01.606
- I'm here all week.

13:01.650 --> 13:04.044
- Welcome to City Hall.

13:04.087 --> 13:06.176
Don't be late again.

13:26.501 --> 13:27.981
- Hizzoner!

13:29.330 --> 13:30.853
Where's your detail?

13:30.897 --> 13:32.855
- Eh, resting outside
comfortably on the city's dime.

13:32.899 --> 13:34.944
- Oh, Old Man Daley
wouldn't take a shit

13:34.988 --> 13:36.859
without a cop
outside his stall.

13:36.903 --> 13:38.643
- Lucky cop.

13:39.775 --> 13:41.559
- What's this?

13:41.603 --> 13:43.823
- It's the lawsuit
against North Park.

13:43.866 --> 13:45.346
Go ahead and rip it up.

13:45.389 --> 13:47.304
- Yo, Pat, your dog's up.

13:48.653 --> 13:50.003
- I hope you made better deals

13:50.046 --> 13:51.656
when you were
a public defender

13:51.700 --> 13:54.659
'cause you just gave away
the store.

13:54.703 --> 13:56.661
- What are you talking about?

13:56.705 --> 13:57.924
- What the hell
are you thinking

13:57.967 --> 13:59.882
bringing Jessica Pearson
into City Hall?

13:59.926 --> 14:01.797
Are you a goddamn idiot?
- Here you go.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.799
- I had no choice.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.061
She was gonna
crack open your books

14:05.105 --> 14:06.846
and tie your
dirty money to me.

14:06.889 --> 14:08.543
What was I supposed to do?
- Figure something out.

14:08.586 --> 14:09.936
You don't give her
the keys to the kingdom.

14:09.979 --> 14:12.068
- I'm giving her an office,
that's all.

14:12.112 --> 14:14.810
And if anyone's to blame
for this mess, it's you.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.507
- Hey, watch yourself,
Bobby Boy.

14:16.551 --> 14:17.900
- Oh, now it's Bobby Boy.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.510
When it's
the middle of the night

14:19.554 --> 14:20.903
and you've been played
like a chump, then it's,

14:20.947 --> 14:22.731
"Do something for me,
Mr. Mayor."

14:22.774 --> 14:24.951
- All right, without me, you're
a lifer on the City Council

14:24.994 --> 14:28.606
making speeches about opposite
side of the street parking.

14:28.650 --> 14:29.956
- I know what I owe you.
- Do ya?

14:29.999 --> 14:31.479
'Cause you better
not have any illusions

14:31.522 --> 14:32.959
about letting this woman
get between us.

14:33.002 --> 14:34.743
- I don't know what that means.

14:34.786 --> 14:36.701
- It means that now that you
know what she's capable of,

14:36.745 --> 14:38.573
are you going to use her
to come after me?

14:38.616 --> 14:41.576
- Jesus Christ. I told you,
I know where I stand.

14:41.619 --> 14:43.012
- What about where she stands?

14:43.056 --> 14:44.666
Okay, that shit with North Park

14:44.709 --> 14:46.581
is nothing compared
to what she could find.

14:46.624 --> 14:48.670
She's a threat
to both of us, Bobby.

14:48.713 --> 14:50.759
- And that's why I hired her.

14:52.543 --> 14:55.372
Someone once taught me
to keep my enemies close.

14:57.984 --> 14:59.942
- Well, you remember that

14:59.986 --> 15:02.553
the first time she pulls
on her leash.

15:05.992 --> 15:08.472
- Bobby Novak in the house!

15:17.873 --> 15:20.876
- There are plenty of good
restaurants in your ward.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.139
Norm's, I hear,
has a fabulous gumbo.

15:23.183 --> 15:24.575
- Well, I'm not required to eat

15:24.619 --> 15:26.012
in the community
I serve, ma'am.

15:26.055 --> 15:28.753
- No, but you are required
to serve that community

15:28.797 --> 15:31.756
and from what I gather, you're
falling sleeping on the job.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.889
- I don't mean to be rude,
but who are you?

15:33.933 --> 15:35.847
- I'm working on behalf
of those nice people

15:35.891 --> 15:38.589
who are starving
to keep their school open.

15:38.633 --> 15:40.765
- You can tell those nice
people instead of blaming me,

15:40.809 --> 15:42.550
they should be thanking me.

15:42.593 --> 15:44.813
- Now I know politicians like
to take credit for everything,

15:44.856 --> 15:47.120
but you're going to have
to walk me through that one.

15:47.163 --> 15:49.557
- Did you know I grew up just
down the street from Franklin?

15:49.600 --> 15:51.472
- I know all about you.
- Then you also know,

15:51.515 --> 15:53.822
I took a bus 21 miles roundtrip
every day

15:53.865 --> 15:56.172
because my parents wanted me
educated at a magnet school.

15:56.216 --> 15:58.958
I hated every minute of it, but
it was the best thing for me.

15:59.001 --> 16:00.698
- Are you saying
you know what's best

16:00.742 --> 16:02.222
for the people
of your ward?

16:02.265 --> 16:04.006
- I'm saying if they let me,
I'm trying to lift them up.

16:04.050 --> 16:05.486
- The only person
you're interested

16:05.529 --> 16:08.184
in lifting up is yourself.

16:08.228 --> 16:09.577
- You look like
you've been doing pretty well

16:09.620 --> 16:11.057
for yourself too

16:11.100 --> 16:12.928
and I know all the community
organizers in this town.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.887
So I will ask you again:
who the hell are you?

16:15.931 --> 16:18.586
- I work for
your friend Bobby Novak

16:18.629 --> 16:20.066
and if you think
he's going to sacrifice

16:20.109 --> 16:22.111
his re-election
to keep you in office,

16:22.155 --> 16:23.808
you're sadly mistaken.

16:41.130 --> 16:44.177
I'm assuming you're
the "me" in "see me."

16:50.009 --> 16:51.271
- Did you tell Debbie Coats

16:51.314 --> 16:52.837
I was going to sell
her down the river?

16:52.881 --> 16:54.709
- I told her it wasn't
in her self interest

16:54.752 --> 16:55.971
to close down that school.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.625
- God damn it,
let's be clear here.

16:57.668 --> 16:59.105
I gave you an assignment

16:59.148 --> 17:00.715
and not only did you ignore it,

17:00.758 --> 17:02.543
you alienated
one of my closest allies.

17:02.586 --> 17:06.199
- First of all,
I'm not your student,

17:06.242 --> 17:07.983
I don't take assignments.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.854
Secondly, you ally yourself
with that woman

17:09.898 --> 17:11.291
and you're going to be
a one-term mayor.

17:11.334 --> 17:12.857
- You don't know anything
about politics.

17:12.901 --> 17:14.685
- But I know about power
and if you sit around,

17:14.729 --> 17:16.992
waiting for this thing to blow
over, you won't have any.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.299
- Please, you've been here
all of two minutes?

17:19.342 --> 17:21.866
- And it took half that to see
what they think about you

17:21.910 --> 17:23.259
on the South Side.

17:23.303 --> 17:24.913
These aren't stupid people,
Mr. Mayor.

17:24.956 --> 17:26.306
- Oh, I know that.
- They're smart.

17:26.349 --> 17:27.785
- I agree.
- They're passionate,

17:27.829 --> 17:29.700
and all they want is
for their children--

17:29.744 --> 17:31.050
- Thanks for the civics lesson.
- To go to a decent school!

17:31.093 --> 17:32.834
- I'm a product
of public schools.

17:32.877 --> 17:34.662
I would love nothing more than
to pour money into Franklin

17:34.705 --> 17:36.185
and every other school
about to close.

17:36.229 --> 17:38.622
It breaks my heart when I see
what's going on out there,

17:38.666 --> 17:40.189
but I have to make choices.

17:40.233 --> 17:42.539
- Then make
the right choice now.

17:43.149 --> 17:44.802
- This isn't going to work.

17:44.846 --> 17:46.804
- Oh, come on, baby,
this is our first fight.

17:46.848 --> 17:48.154
Don't be like that.
- I'm not joking around.

17:48.197 --> 17:50.286
You knew what the deal was
when you took it.

17:50.330 --> 17:52.245
You may not be my student,
but you do take assignments

17:52.288 --> 17:54.247
and if you can't do that,

17:54.290 --> 17:56.118
we'll shake hands
and call it a day.

17:56.162 --> 17:58.164
- So you'd be willing
to cut ties right here and now.

17:58.207 --> 18:00.035
- In a New York second.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.342
- And what makes you think I
won't toss that little grenade

18:02.385 --> 18:03.995
I have on you and Pat McGann?

18:06.607 --> 18:09.827
- If you really thought that
would get you what you wanted,

18:09.871 --> 18:12.265
you'd have done it already.

18:12.308 --> 18:15.790
- And what is it you think
I want, Mr. Mayor?

18:15.833 --> 18:18.880
- The opportunity to stand
where you are right now.

18:34.722 --> 18:36.898
- You're moving out?

18:36.941 --> 18:39.118
- I'm taking that trial
in Miami.

18:39.161 --> 18:41.859
- The one you said you weren't
interested in two weeks ago.

18:41.903 --> 18:43.905
- Well, Dana convinced me

18:43.948 --> 18:45.646
that they could really use
my expertise.

18:47.213 --> 18:49.040
- How long are you gonna
be gone?

18:49.084 --> 18:51.086
- It's a RICO trial, Jessica.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.001
You remember
what those are like.

18:53.044 --> 18:54.350
- So do you want
to get into it now

18:54.394 --> 18:56.004
or do you want to run away

18:56.047 --> 18:57.658
and pretend we don't
have things to talk about?

18:57.701 --> 18:59.747
- I'm not running anywhere.
My firm needed my help--

18:59.790 --> 19:02.010
- Don't lie to me, Jeff.

19:02.053 --> 19:03.620
You're better than that.

19:04.795 --> 19:07.929
You need space,
say you want space.

19:07.972 --> 19:10.192
But don't pretend you didn't
call them and volunteer.

19:10.236 --> 19:11.933
- You want the truth?

19:11.976 --> 19:14.762
I did go to them
and volunteer.

19:18.026 --> 19:20.811
I should go,
I'm already cutting it close.

19:20.855 --> 19:22.900
I'll call you in a day or so.

19:24.815 --> 19:26.643
- So much for having my back.

19:30.081 --> 19:31.822
I do have your back,
Jessica,

19:31.866 --> 19:34.042
but there are two people
in every relationship.

19:34.085 --> 19:36.087
Two.

19:36.131 --> 19:38.264
And right,
I need to look after my own.

19:52.930 --> 19:56.282
- No offense, but I am not
gonna miss this place.

19:58.066 --> 19:59.154
-  Well, I don't want
to see you back in here either.

20:00.590 --> 20:01.156
Better listen to what that
nurse said about your shots.

20:02.288 --> 20:04.246
- Screw that,
but I'll listen to you

20:04.290 --> 20:05.769
'cause you're
the best nurse here.

20:05.813 --> 20:08.729
- Oh, to be honest,
I'm not actually a nurse.

20:08.772 --> 20:10.470
- You got the outfit.

20:10.513 --> 20:13.255
- Yeah, it's called
a Certified Nursing Assistant,

20:13.299 --> 20:15.170
but what I mostly do
is change sheets

20:15.214 --> 20:17.520
and clean bed pans.

20:17.564 --> 20:19.435
- I would hate that.

20:19.479 --> 20:21.437
- Yeah,
I don't love it either,

20:21.481 --> 20:23.613
but I never had a chance
to get an education.

20:23.657 --> 20:25.354
That's why what you're doing
to save the school

20:25.398 --> 20:26.790
is so important.

20:26.834 --> 20:29.445
- Thank your cousin for that.

20:29.489 --> 20:30.794
- What do you mean?

20:30.838 --> 20:32.579
- She came by
to see me last night.

20:32.622 --> 20:33.971
Said she knows the mayor

20:34.015 --> 20:36.235
and that she'd do
all she can to help.

20:36.278 --> 20:38.628
- She said that, huh?

20:38.672 --> 20:40.456
- It was nice of her
to check in on me.

20:40.500 --> 20:43.677
She didn't have to do that.

20:46.506 --> 20:48.986
I know, it's just what
everybody's doing these days.

20:49.030 --> 20:51.511
I'm telling you,
you don't look 100.

20:51.554 --> 20:53.339
You don't look a day over 99.

20:55.645 --> 20:58.561
I gotta call you back.
Okay, bye.

20:58.605 --> 21:00.476
- Hello, Keri.

21:00.520 --> 21:02.304
- Ms. Person.

21:02.348 --> 21:03.958
I understand you're joining
our happy little family.

21:04.001 --> 21:06.830
- I am and because I know
what a busy woman you are,

21:06.874 --> 21:08.484
I've taken it upon myself

21:08.528 --> 21:10.704
to whip up the first draft
of a lawsuit.

21:10.747 --> 21:13.315
- Shouldn't be news to you,
but you're not a lawyer anymore.

21:13.359 --> 21:15.448
- It's like riding a bike.

21:18.712 --> 21:21.802
- City of Chicago
v. Midwest Portage.

21:21.845 --> 21:23.499
You want to sue
the bus manufacturer.

21:23.543 --> 21:24.631
- The mayor gave me
an assignment.

21:24.674 --> 21:26.502
I'm just following orders.

21:26.546 --> 21:28.983
- Do you know why we don't go
after our supplier, Ms. Pearson?

21:29.026 --> 21:30.985
- Because you don't know what
a breach of contract looks like?

21:31.028 --> 21:33.857
- Because we have an existing
relationship with the CEO

21:33.901 --> 21:35.337
that stretches back
over ten years

21:35.381 --> 21:36.947
- That sounds like patronage
to me.

21:36.991 --> 21:38.688
- and because suing only draws
attention to the fact

21:38.732 --> 21:40.777
that one of the mayor's
signature issues is failing.

21:40.821 --> 21:42.344
- Well, let me guess,
you rather handle it

21:42.388 --> 21:44.694
with endless lunches
on the taxpayer's dime.

21:44.738 --> 21:47.393
- Like I said,
it's a relationship

21:47.436 --> 21:48.785
and you have a lot to learn

21:48.829 --> 21:50.396
about the way things
are done around here.

21:51.701 --> 21:54.443
- And you still have a lot
to learn about being a lawyer.

21:54.487 --> 21:57.054
- I understand
the concept of a bluff.

21:57.098 --> 21:58.795
Is that what this is?

21:58.839 --> 22:00.884
I'd just like to know, since
obviously you have a plan.

22:00.928 --> 22:02.451
- It's a kick in the ass,

22:02.495 --> 22:04.497
which is why
the mayor brought me in.

22:05.585 --> 22:07.369
Nice to see you, Keri.

22:09.458 --> 22:10.720
- Mrs. Pearson.

22:10.764 --> 22:12.026
- Ms. Pearson.

22:12.069 --> 22:14.724
- Right, uh,
I just wanted to say that

22:14.768 --> 22:16.726
I heard what you're doing
with the hunger strikers

22:16.770 --> 22:18.946
and if you need any help
with anything--

22:18.989 --> 22:21.383
- I'm sorry, who are you?

22:21.427 --> 22:24.386
- I'm Derrick Mayes, ma'am.
I'm the mayor's press secretary.

22:24.430 --> 22:25.909
- Oh, in that case,
maybe you should talk to him.

22:25.953 --> 22:28.390
- I talk to him all the time,

22:28.434 --> 22:30.566
but it doesn't seem
to change anything.

22:30.610 --> 22:33.003
I mean, don't get me wrong,
Bobby's like Superman to me,

22:33.047 --> 22:35.571
but he straddles the fence
on too many issues

22:35.615 --> 22:37.443
and I'm glad someone's here
to push him.

22:37.486 --> 22:39.096
- You shouldn't go behind
the mayor's back like this.

22:39.140 --> 22:41.882
It's good for him.

22:41.925 --> 22:43.710
- He won't see it that way.

22:44.798 --> 22:47.366
- Isn't that what you did
with the alderman?

22:48.628 --> 22:50.499
- Someone likes
to listen in on conversations.

22:50.543 --> 22:52.588
- My ear's to the ground,
ma'am, not outside his door.

22:52.632 --> 22:54.634
- Oh, I'm sorry to
disappoint you, Derrick Mayes,

22:54.677 --> 22:56.113
but the strikers
are on their own.

22:56.157 --> 22:57.724
- This is exactly
the kind of thing

22:57.767 --> 22:59.595
we should
be fighting for.

22:59.639 --> 23:01.728
- Then take it up
with Superman.

23:01.771 --> 23:03.425
- I'm taking it up with you.

23:08.474 --> 23:09.953
- Am I taking orders
from this woman?

23:09.997 --> 23:11.955
I just wanna know what
the ground rules are.

23:11.999 --> 23:13.783
- Keri, keep your voice down.

23:13.827 --> 23:15.872
- Stay in her lane.
She's not only out of her lane,

23:15.916 --> 23:17.961
she's swerving
into oncoming traffic.

23:19.659 --> 23:21.138
- What happened?

23:21.182 --> 23:22.923
- What happened is that
she waltzed into my office

23:22.966 --> 23:25.055
like Marie Fucking Antoinette,
telling me who and what to sue

23:25.099 --> 23:26.927
as though I were an associate
at her law firm.

23:26.970 --> 23:29.625
Midwest Portage.
Ring a bell?

23:29.669 --> 23:31.584
- I told you I was having
her look into it.

23:32.715 --> 23:35.457
- So you're okay with this.

23:35.501 --> 23:37.372
- Yeah, I'm okay with it.

23:37.416 --> 23:38.895
In fact, I'm happy as hell

23:38.939 --> 23:41.376
'cause it shows me someone's
actually listening.

23:42.508 --> 23:44.597
- It's amazing--day two,
it's already come to this.

23:44.640 --> 23:47.121
- Keri.
- Why is she here?

23:47.164 --> 23:48.470
Really, why is she here?

23:48.514 --> 23:49.689
Don't give me
some bullshit excuse

23:49.732 --> 23:51.125
about clearing my plate

23:51.168 --> 23:52.735
and, no,
you cut a deal with her.

23:52.779 --> 23:54.868
- It's not what you think.

23:54.911 --> 23:56.826
- Is this is your way
of marginalizing me?

23:56.870 --> 23:58.524
Because--
- Marginalize you?

23:58.567 --> 24:00.395
I'm trying to protect you.

24:00.439 --> 24:01.788
I know it made you sick
to help McGann

24:01.831 --> 24:03.442
and kick those people
out on the street.

24:03.485 --> 24:05.748
There's too much dirty shit
I have to do,

24:05.792 --> 24:07.489
including why I cut
a deal with her,

24:07.533 --> 24:09.491
and I value you too much
to have you mixed up in it.

24:12.015 --> 24:14.453
- Then tell her to back off
and let me do my job.

24:16.411 --> 24:17.847
- You tell her.

24:20.894 --> 24:22.417
Bobby.

24:22.461 --> 24:24.027
- I miss you.

24:25.855 --> 24:28.641
It's been weeks.
It's killing me.

24:28.684 --> 24:30.860
- I...

24:30.904 --> 24:34.647
I have worked too hard
to be seen as that girl.

24:34.690 --> 24:37.693
- No one sees you as that.

24:37.737 --> 24:39.739
- She does.

24:39.782 --> 24:42.524
The woman that you bought in
to keep me clean,

24:42.568 --> 24:43.786
she sees me as that

24:43.830 --> 24:46.746
and every time I see her,
it's a reminder.

24:46.789 --> 24:49.009
- So now she's the reason
we're not sleeping together.

24:50.793 --> 24:52.621
- It's ironic, isn't it?

25:18.604 --> 25:21.737
- Oh, I love the whole
Deep Throat thing.

25:21.781 --> 25:24.087
- I shouldn't be seen with you.
- Oh, relax.

25:24.131 --> 25:25.567
You're a cop.

25:25.611 --> 25:26.916
Oh, and here's
the money I owe you

25:26.960 --> 25:28.918
for failing to intimidate
Jessica Pearson

25:28.962 --> 25:29.963
when she came to town.

25:30.006 --> 25:31.573
- I don't want it.

25:31.617 --> 25:33.096
- Come on,
think of it as a retainer.

25:33.140 --> 25:34.881
- Listen, Pat,
I've been thinking--

25:34.924 --> 25:37.274
- No, don't think.
Just do your job

25:37.318 --> 25:39.189
and let me know what
Bobby's doing with this woman.

25:39.233 --> 25:41.191
- You want me to spy
on my brother?

25:41.235 --> 25:42.628
- Just keep your eyes
and ears open.

25:42.671 --> 25:44.499
Don't get all dramatic.

25:44.543 --> 25:45.892
- I'm getting a little tired
of you telling me what to do.

25:45.935 --> 25:47.589
- All right, easy, kiddo.
- I'm his brother!

25:47.633 --> 25:49.243
- You're his half-brother.

25:49.286 --> 25:52.942
His bastard half-brother
who he won't even acknowledge

25:52.986 --> 25:55.641
because he cares more
about his political future.

25:57.643 --> 26:01.647
Hey, look, I'm not saying
Bobby doesn't care about you.

26:01.690 --> 26:03.213
I know he does.

26:03.257 --> 26:05.041
But if this woman
pokes her nose in things

26:05.085 --> 26:09.263
and blows everything up,
you're not a Novak.

26:09.306 --> 26:11.134
That's all I'm saying.

26:12.135 --> 26:15.661
So if not for me,
do it for yourself.

26:38.814 --> 26:39.162
-When you said you wanted
to meet after work,

26:40.599 --> 26:41.991
I was hoping it'd be a
Bulls game not a charity event.

26:42.035 --> 26:44.733
- Oh, well, I can't justify
a $1,000

26:44.777 --> 26:46.735
on somebody
who's already welching.

26:46.779 --> 26:49.738
- Okay, I admit.

26:49.782 --> 26:52.393
We're behind on the buses.
Guilty as charged.

26:52.436 --> 26:54.308
- I appreciate the mea culpa,
Dennis,

26:54.351 --> 26:56.658
but the mayor still thinks
that you're punishing him

26:56.702 --> 26:58.747
because you didn't get
the Lansing deal.

26:58.791 --> 27:00.314
I'd hate to think
you're that petty.

27:00.357 --> 27:02.098
- That's not what
this is about.

27:02.142 --> 27:05.188
The God's honest truth is
that our supply chain is broken.

27:05.232 --> 27:07.408
- Blaming the supply chain.

27:07.451 --> 27:09.323
That never gets old.

27:09.366 --> 27:11.412
- I'm sorry, you are?

27:11.455 --> 27:13.544
- Jessica Pearson.

27:13.588 --> 27:16.460
I thought the two of you would
be discussing settlement?

27:16.504 --> 27:18.462
- Settlement?
What is she talking--

27:18.506 --> 27:20.160
- I'm sorry, we must've gotten
our wires crossed.

27:20.203 --> 27:21.552
We were discussing a plan

27:21.596 --> 27:23.337
for expediting
the delivery of the buses.

27:23.380 --> 27:26.079
- Oh, a plan never starts
with the God's honest truth.

27:26.122 --> 27:29.560
That's an excuse and the
mayor has had enough of them.

27:29.604 --> 27:31.171
I believe this is yours.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.394
- You're suing me.

27:37.438 --> 27:40.049
- No, um,
nobody's suing anyone.

27:40.093 --> 27:41.834
Ms. Pearson is new
and she doesn't understand

27:41.877 --> 27:43.270
how things are done in Chicago.

27:43.313 --> 27:45.098
- She's right.

27:45.141 --> 27:47.143
In New York when someone's
serving up bullshit excuses,

27:47.187 --> 27:50.364
it doesn't matter if they're
backed by a stringed quartet.

27:50.407 --> 27:51.626
They're still bullshit.

27:51.670 --> 27:53.149
- What's bullshit
is you pulling this

27:53.193 --> 27:55.804
good cop/bad cop act on me.

27:55.848 --> 27:59.068
I still have a lot of pending
deals with your office, Keri.

28:00.156 --> 28:02.724
- Yes, you do
and unless you're willing

28:02.768 --> 28:05.118
to start honoring
your contract today,

28:05.161 --> 28:07.120
I may want to rethink
all of them.

28:07.163 --> 28:09.078
- I don't appreciate
being played.

28:09.122 --> 28:11.646
- Neither does the city.
See you in court.

28:16.695 --> 28:19.436
- I like the way
you went with that.

28:19.480 --> 28:21.395
You almost remind me
of a young me.

28:21.438 --> 28:23.136
- What the hell do
you think you're doing?

28:23.179 --> 28:24.746
- At the moment, your job.

28:24.790 --> 28:27.401
- That would be impossible
since I'm the actual lawyer.

28:27.444 --> 28:28.750
- That didn't stop me
from getting

28:28.794 --> 28:30.839
one of the 20 eager lawyers
in your office

28:30.883 --> 28:32.406
to draft that for me.

28:32.449 --> 28:33.712
- Oh, is that what
this is about?

28:33.755 --> 28:35.714
You want to humiliate me.
- Humiliate you?

28:35.757 --> 28:37.324
I've just raised your stock.

28:37.367 --> 28:40.719
You've finally shown him
you have a spine.

28:48.291 --> 28:51.860
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Not the million!

28:51.904 --> 28:55.255
Ooh, thank God.

28:55.298 --> 28:56.473
- She didn't lose the money,
did she?

28:56.517 --> 28:58.519
Please tell me
she didn't lose it.

28:58.562 --> 29:00.347
- No, thank God,

29:00.390 --> 29:03.263
but that red ball bounced
ten times before it landed.

29:03.306 --> 29:05.439
Yeah.

29:05.482 --> 29:07.702
- The kids asleep?
- Yeah.

29:07.746 --> 29:10.749
I put them down
about an hour ago.

29:10.792 --> 29:13.273
- Be nice to see them awake
once before they're 18.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.363
- Thanks, Ma.

29:18.887 --> 29:20.671
- Did you hear from Jessica?

29:20.715 --> 29:23.326
- No.
Something wrong?

29:23.370 --> 29:26.329
- No. She showed up
at the hospital yesterday,

29:26.373 --> 29:27.940
got all up in my business.

29:27.983 --> 29:29.419
- What happened?

29:29.463 --> 29:30.681
- Remember those kids on TV,

29:30.725 --> 29:32.335
they're trying
to save Franklin?

29:32.379 --> 29:34.642
One of them landed in my ER.

29:34.685 --> 29:36.296
Dear Lord.

29:36.339 --> 29:39.429
- In walks Jessica
making big promises

29:39.473 --> 29:41.954
to this poor girl
about keeping her school open.

29:41.997 --> 29:44.521
- Maybe she'll do it.

29:44.565 --> 29:46.610
- What makes you say that?

29:46.654 --> 29:48.177
- What? I--

29:48.221 --> 29:50.310
- Ma, these kids are starving
themselves

29:50.353 --> 29:51.877
and no one gives a damn
if they live or die,

29:51.920 --> 29:53.530
but some outsider strolls in

29:53.574 --> 29:54.967
and they're just going
to keep the school open?

29:55.010 --> 29:58.187
- She is a successful woman,
Angela.

29:58.231 --> 30:00.494
People, they--
they listen to her.

30:00.537 --> 30:02.452
- Yeah, well, people listen
to a lot of folk

30:02.496 --> 30:04.237
who are full of shit.

30:04.280 --> 30:07.675
- You are being
a little too hard on her.

30:07.718 --> 30:09.503
- She's all talk, Ma,

30:09.546 --> 30:11.810
and the sooner
you realize that, the better.

30:12.854 --> 30:16.510
- One red ball left.

30:22.472 --> 30:24.213
- The mayor went home.
- I'm not looking for the mayor.

30:24.257 --> 30:25.824
I'm looking for you.

30:26.999 --> 30:28.957
- I'm sorry
if I overstepped my bounds.

30:29.001 --> 30:30.698
I can get a little overzealous.

30:30.741 --> 30:32.700
- No, overzealous is good
in the right hands.

30:32.743 --> 30:34.528
It gets things done.

30:35.921 --> 30:37.879
- You want something from me,
don't you?

30:37.923 --> 30:40.229
- You want to make a difference,
all you have to do is get me

30:40.273 --> 30:42.362
the last three tax returns
for Alderman Coats

30:42.405 --> 30:43.667
and tell me where she lives.

30:43.711 --> 30:45.278
- Is this legal?

30:45.321 --> 30:47.584
We're not doing anything
illegal, are we?

30:47.628 --> 30:49.412
- We're putting our money
where our mouth is.

30:58.421 --> 30:59.727
- Hey, don't forget.

30:59.770 --> 31:01.250
We got that fundraiser
up in Glencoe

31:01.294 --> 31:02.730
before the council
meeting tomorrow.

31:02.773 --> 31:03.992
- I got a lane on 94
in case we're running late.

31:04.036 --> 31:05.428
- Good man.

31:05.472 --> 31:07.604
- I saw McGann today.

31:11.913 --> 31:14.046
- That's funny.

31:14.089 --> 31:15.612
I guess he didn't like
what I had to say.

31:15.656 --> 31:16.962
- What's that supposed to mean?

31:17.005 --> 31:18.572
- C'mon, Nick.
You know what it means.

31:18.615 --> 31:20.487
He tries to divide us.
That's his thing.

31:20.530 --> 31:23.446
- Maybe so, but he's not
wrong about that Pearson woman.

31:24.621 --> 31:26.754
- That fat piece of shit.

31:26.797 --> 31:28.582
You see, he's doing it already.

31:28.625 --> 31:30.366
Suddenly,
it's you and him on a side.

31:30.410 --> 31:32.934
- I don't want to be on
his side, but I need an ally.

31:32.978 --> 31:34.675
- We're together every day.

31:34.718 --> 31:35.937
- What, this?

31:35.981 --> 31:38.070
I took this bullshit job
for you, Bobby.

31:38.113 --> 31:39.941
To serve and protect one man.

31:39.985 --> 31:41.943
You.
- I don't believe this shit.

31:41.987 --> 31:43.945
- Where am I in all of this?

31:43.989 --> 31:45.425
What happens
if the truth comes out?

31:45.468 --> 31:46.774
- Nothing's coming out.

31:46.817 --> 31:47.993
- Who's going to look out
for me, Bobby?

31:48.036 --> 31:49.690
- All I've ever done
is look out for you!

31:49.733 --> 31:51.300
From the minute I knew,

31:51.344 --> 31:52.954
I treated you like
my own flesh and blood.

31:52.998 --> 31:55.000
I protected you,
I confided in you,

31:55.043 --> 31:56.958
and I got you on this bullshit
detail that every other cop

31:57.002 --> 31:58.829
in the city wants
because you're family.

31:58.873 --> 32:00.614
You're the one who doesn't come
inside the house.

32:00.657 --> 32:02.964
You're the one.
That's on you.

32:06.837 --> 32:08.752
- It's you and me.

32:13.932 --> 32:15.455
- I love you.

Not anymore.

33:38.146 --> 33:40.105
- Well, that's a question
for one of your colleagues.

33:40.148 --> 33:41.932
Someone from
the mayor's office called

33:41.976 --> 33:43.586
and said the matter
had been settled.

33:43.630 --> 33:45.762
- Now, would the parties

Hijacking my meeting
is one thing,

34:05.043 --> 34:06.827
but hanging me out to dry
in court is another.

34:06.870 --> 34:09.438
That affects my reputation
and that I won't stand for.

34:09.482 --> 34:10.831
- You should've thought
about reputation

34:10.874 --> 34:12.920
before you took my license.

34:12.963 --> 34:14.095
- Have you ever thought about

34:14.139 --> 34:15.444
why I took your license,
Ms. Pearson?

34:15.488 --> 34:16.967
- Oh, I know why.

34:17.011 --> 34:19.100
You're pissed because I made
your office look like shit

34:19.144 --> 34:20.928
with the 13th District case.

34:20.971 --> 34:23.757
- Wrong! You made the
13th District look like shit.

34:23.800 --> 34:25.802
My father was a police officer

34:25.846 --> 34:28.066
and he didn't go out there and
risk his life every single day

34:28.109 --> 34:31.634
so you could call him
and all other cops animals.

34:31.678 --> 34:34.115
- I didn't know
about your father.

34:34.159 --> 34:36.030
- You do now.

34:36.074 --> 34:39.120
- And I didn't
call them anything.

34:39.164 --> 34:41.992
I went after specific men
who did specific things.

34:42.036 --> 34:44.952
- Well, let me be specific
with you right now.

34:44.995 --> 34:47.955
You want to come at me,
come at me,

34:47.998 --> 34:49.783
but stay the hell away
from my department

34:49.826 --> 34:51.654
and any of the lawyers
who work for me

34:51.698 --> 34:54.788
or I'll make disbarment
feel like jaywalking.

34:54.831 --> 34:57.182
- Are you threatening me?

34:57.225 --> 34:59.184
- I'm warning you.

34:59.227 --> 35:01.142
I've been underestimated
my whole life

35:01.186 --> 35:03.101
'cause I don't look like
a policeman's daughter.

35:03.144 --> 35:05.929
But I'm 33 years old
and I'm the City Attorney.

35:07.192 --> 35:09.498
I didn't get where I am
by being stupid.

35:21.249 --> 35:22.120
- The Council
will come to order.

35:23.338 --> 35:24.600
I'll now call the role.
Alderman Blake.

35:24.644 --> 35:26.428
- Present.
- Alderman Morrison?

35:26.472 --> 35:28.256
- Present.
- Alderman Coats.

35:28.300 --> 35:31.346
- Uh, if I may before we begin,
I'd like permission to speak.

35:34.219 --> 35:37.135
As you know, I believe
a math and science education

35:37.178 --> 35:39.137
is vital to the future
of our young people.

35:39.180 --> 35:41.400
That's why I supported
the Richard Feynman School

35:41.443 --> 35:43.184
of Science and Engineering,

35:43.228 --> 35:44.533
a charter school
on the North side,

35:44.577 --> 35:47.101
to replace my ward's
aging high school.

35:47.145 --> 35:48.581
As I said,
it's a short distance

35:48.624 --> 35:50.235
for our kids to travel,

35:50.278 --> 35:52.280
but it'll take them far
in their careers.

35:52.324 --> 35:55.196
However,
in light of the community's

35:55.240 --> 35:58.199
incredible commitment
to keep Franklin open

35:58.243 --> 36:01.289
and the mayor's personal plea,

36:01.333 --> 36:05.598
I have decided to withdraw my
support for closing the school.

36:05.641 --> 36:06.816
- Yes!

36:10.211 --> 36:12.387
Please, please.
If you will.

36:14.041 --> 36:16.391
Effective immediately,
I have also decided to resign

36:16.435 --> 36:18.132
as alderman of the 54th Ward

36:18.176 --> 36:20.787
to pursue opportunities
in the private sector.

36:20.830 --> 36:23.050
It's been an honor to serve
and work with you all.

36:24.704 --> 36:26.314
What the hell is going on?

36:26.358 --> 36:27.576
I'm going to look like an idiot

36:27.620 --> 36:29.622
if I don't make some kind
of statement.

36:29.665 --> 36:31.058
- This has all the information

36:31.101 --> 36:32.668
about the alderman's
new position

36:32.712 --> 36:34.670
as well as a commitment
to rebuild schools

36:34.714 --> 36:36.368
in Kenwood
and the surrounding communities.

36:36.411 --> 36:38.631
- You knew about this?
- I did.

36:53.341 --> 36:55.125
- What do you think?

36:55.169 --> 36:58.390
Oyster White
or Charleston Blue?

36:59.826 --> 37:01.741
- I'm just curious.

37:01.784 --> 37:04.483
Since you're the one
who got her the job,

37:04.526 --> 37:05.875
what exactly is Debbie Coats

37:05.919 --> 37:07.573
going to be doing
at Midwest Portage?

37:07.616 --> 37:09.662
- She's going
to make it a priority

37:09.705 --> 37:11.359
to ramp up production

37:11.403 --> 37:15.145
and deliver your fleet
of electric buses.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.239
- You went behind my back,
Ms. Pearson.

37:21.282 --> 37:23.763
- I made you look good,
Mr. Mayor.

37:23.806 --> 37:25.721
You just ended
a 23 day hunger strike.

37:25.765 --> 37:28.333
- Did I?
I mean, the strike only ended

37:28.376 --> 37:31.249
because a greedy alderman
took a cush VP job.

37:31.292 --> 37:32.728
- And now you have 60 days
to replace her

37:32.772 --> 37:35.557
with someone who better
represents the community.

37:35.601 --> 37:38.168
You might want
to make a statement about that

37:38.212 --> 37:40.127
so the strikers know
you heard them.

37:40.170 --> 37:41.694
- You mean this.

37:41.737 --> 37:43.304
- I like that Derrick.

37:43.348 --> 37:45.785
He is on top of everything.

37:48.353 --> 37:49.745
- You know,
you may not know this,

37:49.789 --> 37:52.270
but I was the youngest alderman
ever elected.

37:52.313 --> 37:53.749
26.

37:53.793 --> 37:55.316
I'd done a whole year at
the public defender's office.

37:55.360 --> 37:57.275
I was ready
to take on the world.

37:57.318 --> 37:58.580
First month in,
I tried to raise

37:58.624 --> 38:01.322
the minimum wage to $7.25.

38:01.366 --> 38:03.411
7.25's half what it should be.

38:03.455 --> 38:06.284
You would've thought
I was a Leninist.

38:06.327 --> 38:09.548
But I didn't back down
and I pushed it through.

38:09.591 --> 38:10.766
- See, I knew
there was a dreamer

38:10.810 --> 38:12.594
hiding in there somewhere.

38:12.638 --> 38:14.640
Look where you are now.

38:14.683 --> 38:17.599
- I'm where I am right now
because right after that,

38:17.643 --> 38:20.167
the oldest member told me
what might happen

38:20.210 --> 38:23.301
if I bit off too much
too soon.

38:23.344 --> 38:25.912
- I can't tell if
that's advice or a warning.

38:25.955 --> 38:28.175
- You saved the day today,

38:28.218 --> 38:30.482
but everything we do here
has real life consequences.

38:30.525 --> 38:31.787
- You think I don't know that?

38:31.831 --> 38:33.354
- I think you're a smart woman

38:33.398 --> 38:35.878
who doesn't understand
that when shit happens,

38:35.922 --> 38:38.403
it's my name on the door,
not yours.

38:41.406 --> 38:44.757
- This is all new to me,
Mr. Mayor,

38:44.800 --> 38:46.585
and it's going
to take a little time

38:46.628 --> 38:48.630
for me to get used
to not calling the shots.

38:49.849 --> 38:52.460
But I don't think you want me
taking smaller bites.

38:52.504 --> 38:54.332
- No?
- No.

38:56.377 --> 39:00.512
- I think you have
a problem you need solved

39:00.555 --> 39:03.776
and that's why
you brought me in.

39:03.819 --> 39:06.822
Now you've seen
what I can do,

39:06.866 --> 39:09.956
why don't you tell me
what Pat McGann has on you.

39:17.442 --> 39:19.879
I'd go with the blue.

39:23.404 --> 39:30.368
A♪

39:48.734 --> 39:50.997
- Oh, Jessica!

39:52.564 --> 39:54.261
Hey, why don't you come in?

39:54.304 --> 39:56.437
- Oh, I don't think I should.

39:56.481 --> 39:57.699
- Is something wrong?

39:57.743 --> 39:59.875
Lily, I need
to tell you something

39:59.919 --> 40:02.661
that I--I should
have told you days ago.

40:04.532 --> 40:06.316
I dropped your lawsuit

40:06.360 --> 40:08.580

with the mayor.

40:09.755 --> 40:11.887
- I know.

40:11.931 --> 40:13.802
- Angela said
she didn't tell you.

40:13.846 --> 40:15.456
- She didn't have to tell me.

40:15.500 --> 40:17.763
I know when something's
going on with my daughter.

40:19.460 --> 40:22.420
- Lillian, I'm so sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

40:22.463 --> 40:25.858
But the question is why?
Why--why didn't you tell me?

40:25.901 --> 40:27.903
I--I didn't want to tell you
that I'd failed.

40:27.947 --> 40:29.644
- You didn't fail, Jessica.

40:29.688 --> 40:32.386
- No, I made a promise
to save your home

40:32.430 --> 40:34.040
and I couldn't make it happen.

40:35.041 --> 40:37.609

Come inside.

40:40.960 --> 40:44.354
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Jeff is waiting for me.

40:44.398 --> 40:46.574
Um...

40:49.795 --> 40:51.753

41:25.570 --> 41:28.398
- I'm concerned about you.

41:28.442 --> 41:29.704
You left work early.

41:29.748 --> 41:31.663
- Don't be.
I'm fine.

41:32.533 --> 41:34.404
- Is that
number three or four?

41:36.450 --> 41:38.104
- Think you know me so well.

41:38.147 --> 41:40.498
- I do, and it's not like you
to run from a fight.

41:40.541 --> 41:42.064
- Oh, fuck you.
- There's my girl.

41:42.108 --> 41:43.936
- No, I'm not your girl

41:43.979 --> 41:45.981
and I don't need you coming
around here checking on me.

41:46.025 --> 41:48.549
- Well, maybe I need you.
Did you ever think of that?

41:48.593 --> 41:50.159
- You should've thought of that
before you brought that woman

41:50.203 --> 41:51.726
into my office.

41:51.770 --> 41:53.554
- She's not here
to replace you.

41:53.598 --> 41:56.557
-  Believe me, I'm not
sticking around to find out.

41:56.601 --> 41:58.820
- What does that mean?

41:58.864 --> 42:00.126
Keri.

42:01.431 --> 42:03.869
I don't care
who has power in the office

42:03.912 --> 42:06.698
or what she does.

42:06.741 --> 42:10.179
I'm here risking
every goddamn thing in my life

42:10.223 --> 42:12.704
because you're
the person I need.

42:14.009 --> 42:16.446
