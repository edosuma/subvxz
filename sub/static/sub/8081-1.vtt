WEBVTT

00:39.198 --> 00:42.118
<i>From the dawn of time we came,</i>

00:42.285 --> 00:44.996
<i>moving silently among you</i>

00:45.204 --> 00:48.000
<i>down through the centuries.</i>

00:48.416 --> 00:50.543
Immortals.

00:50.710 --> 00:53.504
I'm Connor MacLeod of the clan MacLeod,

00:53.713 --> 00:55.798
the Highlander.

00:55.923 --> 00:59.594
After the death of my friend Ramirez,

01:03.681 --> 01:06.726
and my beloved wife Heather,

01:06.851 --> 01:10.321
I left my home in the Highlands of Scotland

01:10.530 --> 01:14.525
and began to wander the world
searching for answers.

01:14.901 --> 01:19.739
Finally, I came to Japan,
to the mountains of Niri,

01:19.906 --> 01:23.702
and the cave of the sorcerer Nakano.

03:31.412 --> 03:35.040
Great danger lies ahead, Highlander.

03:35.166 --> 03:38.335
From a faraway land comes another.

03:38.544 --> 03:42.132
The most feared and evil among us.

03:43.215 --> 03:46.886
He keeps growing stronger everyday,

03:47.094 --> 03:50.723
feeding on the power of other Immortals.

03:50.890 --> 03:55.603
Soon, there will be none left
who can stop him.

03:56.520 --> 04:02.100
If he wins,
the world will suffer eternal damnation.

04:03.360 --> 04:05.198
Who is he?

04:08.741 --> 04:11.120
His name is Kane.

04:50.282 --> 04:54.286
The mountain of Niri, where is it?

04:54.411 --> 04:56.957
[in Japanese] What for?

04:58.374 --> 05:03.337
[in Japanese] Answer me!
Where is the mountain of Niri?

05:03.504 --> 05:07.425
[in Japanese] Do you seek
the power of the sorcerer Nakano?

05:08.926 --> 05:13.055
Maybe the old man still can't hear me.

05:13.305 --> 05:15.366
Burn it down!

06:34.428 --> 06:40.434
- How do I kill him?
- With a heart, soul and steel.

06:42.186 --> 06:48.025
- I've heard that before.
- I know. Ramirez.

06:48.200 --> 06:52.546
Like him, I've lived many lifetimes.

06:53.238 --> 06:58.000
And like him, my gift to you
is my knowledge.

07:19.348 --> 07:23.394
The knowledge does not come easy,
Highlander.

08:11.400 --> 08:14.000
Nothing is what it seems, Highlander.

08:14.500 --> 08:19.200
First, you must be aware
and respect the power of illusion.

08:29.876 --> 08:32.421
You have already lost.

08:39.094 --> 08:43.682
Fight with your spirit,
and the sword will follow.

09:46.453 --> 09:51.750
Well done, Highlander.
The sword wields the spirit of its master.

09:52.250 --> 09:56.880
It can be the gate to either heaven or hell.

09:56.963 --> 10:01.843
Just strike at my head
and you will take all my knowledge.

10:02.052 --> 10:03.597
I will not.

10:07.432 --> 10:11.228
Not even for the power of illusion?

10:18.527 --> 10:20.529
Not even.

10:44.427 --> 10:47.639
- Where to now, Kane?
- There.

11:26.428 --> 11:28.014
Oh, yes.

11:29.723 --> 11:32.059
This is the place.

11:36.813 --> 11:40.584
- You have to go, now.
- What?

11:41.151 --> 11:44.463
Trust me. You must leave.

11:53.622 --> 11:54.957
Nakano...

11:56.666 --> 12:02.255
- You have a long journey ahead of you.
- Why do I have to go?

12:02.797 --> 12:05.717
This is not your time, Highlander.

12:06.009 --> 12:10.472
Remember, they're both mine.

12:15.894 --> 12:17.646
Now, go!

12:20.398 --> 12:22.568
I won't forget you.

12:42.212 --> 12:46.132
Nakano! So good to see you again.

12:46.591 --> 12:50.028
The pleasure is always mine.

12:55.225 --> 12:57.311
Actually, the pleasure's all mine!

13:00.146 --> 13:03.566
Where is the Highlander, huh?

13:08.246 --> 13:11.000
You age badly, you old goat.

13:24.712 --> 13:27.382
I think this is the Highlander!

13:32.011 --> 13:35.390
There can be only one!

13:35.598 --> 13:40.061
- Always in the way, old man, huh?
- More than you know.

13:40.186 --> 13:42.481
When I tell you to go, just go!

13:43.565 --> 13:47.485
Go after the Highlander. Now!

13:52.448 --> 13:54.368
So...

13:55.785 --> 14:00.206
Your magic has improved, wizard.
Why don't you give it to me?

14:00.331 --> 14:05.770
I didn't give it you 200 years ago.
I'm not about to now!

14:05.854 --> 14:11.000
Yes, but if I cut off your head,
I get your magic anyway.

14:11.151 --> 14:14.513
So, we could do this the easy way,

14:14.680 --> 14:19.376
or we could do this the hard way.

14:20.184 --> 14:23.007
My head doesn't come off that easy.

14:23.107 --> 14:27.151
No. But it does come off, nonetheless.

14:45.501 --> 14:48.364
You betrayed yourself, old man.

14:53.134 --> 14:56.846
There can be only one.

15:27.335 --> 15:30.579
Yes, only one!

15:30.963 --> 15:34.926
But it will not be you!

17:06.058 --> 17:08.238
[in Japanese] Hello, Alex. Good to see you.

17:08.278 --> 17:10.438
[in Japanese] Hello, Takamura. How are you?

17:10.605 --> 17:11.939
[in Japanese] Fine, thank you.

17:12.147 --> 17:14.085
The archaeological commission is waiting.

17:14.147 --> 17:16.484
The owner of the corporation
is threatening to shut us down,

17:16.611 --> 17:19.030
so he can continue his foundations.

17:19.113 --> 17:21.050
They can't stop the excavation now.

17:21.113 --> 17:23.451
Alex-san, the Japanese government
has enormous respect

17:23.501 --> 17:26.971
for such a famous archaeologist
as yourself, but this is a delicate situation.

17:29.498 --> 17:34.378
Well, from what you sent me
to authenticate, definitely 16th century.

17:34.503 --> 17:36.213
But check the grid points.

17:36.547 --> 17:40.985
Do you realize this spot is less
than a mile from the center of Niri?

17:41.636 --> 17:45.448
What are you suggesting?
The cave of the sorcerer Nakano?

17:45.831 --> 17:51.562
- Alex-san, Nakano is a legend.
- Oh, which reminds me...

17:51.729 --> 17:55.358
So's Babe Ruth. Based on fact.

17:55.524 --> 17:59.654
Domo Arigato.
Oh, Alex. The commission.

19:41.964 --> 19:44.509
Highlander's out there somewhere.

19:45.676 --> 19:49.638
And he owes me for all those years.

19:50.514 --> 19:52.526
Find him!

19:54.310 --> 19:58.397
Nothing more! Just find him.

20:03.527 --> 20:07.281
Where are we? What's happening?

20:08.115 --> 20:11.070
Nothing really left for you
to worry about, my friend.

20:11.415 --> 20:14.370
- There can be only one!
- Kane!

21:52.428 --> 21:56.683
- Dad, is it okay?
- Yeah.

21:58.976 --> 22:02.439
I didn't think there could be
lightning without clouds.

22:04.273 --> 22:06.109
Let's go.

22:13.407 --> 22:15.704
<i>How can this be happening?</i>

22:16.307 --> 22:19.204
<i>They were all dead,
and the prize was mine.</i>

22:19.830 --> 22:22.494
<i>So who is out there?</i>

22:23.830 --> 22:25.794
<i>And where is he?</i>

22:40.350 --> 22:44.438
If anything happens to me,
I want you to look after John.

22:44.605 --> 22:47.125
What are you talking about?

22:49.151 --> 22:54.239
I have to leave, Jack.
Everything is taken care of.

23:00.037 --> 23:02.831
Does the boy know
you're not his real father?

23:02.915 --> 23:07.336
Oh, yeah! He knew he was adopted
before he could spell it.

23:07.502 --> 23:11.249
I hope whatever's taking you
is worth what you're leaving.

23:12.174 --> 23:18.000
I hope so too.
But I don't have a choice.

23:27.272 --> 23:33.111
<i>I know he's alive.
And I have to find him.</i>

23:33.362 --> 23:37.074
<i>Going back to New York
to the place of the gathering</i>

23:37.199 --> 23:39.910
<i>is not what I had in mind.</i>

23:40.202 --> 23:44.539
<i>Once again, my life was about to change.</i>

24:04.017 --> 24:06.264
What are they doing?
I thought we got clearance last night.

24:06.304 --> 24:09.064
You won't believe this, Alex-san.
Someone broke into the dig.

24:11.191 --> 24:13.235
Oh, shit.

24:21.960 --> 24:24.151
- So what did they take?
- We don't know.

24:24.204 --> 24:25.734
What do you mean, you don't know?

24:25.784 --> 24:29.334
I couldn't pass the police line.
They found two bodies.

24:55.569 --> 24:57.988
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

24:59.072 --> 25:01.908
So this must be the inner chamber.

25:02.033 --> 25:05.245
But how did they know it was here?

25:14.129 --> 25:17.174
Look at this! What, 1500s?

25:17.257 --> 25:19.469
Remarkable copy.

25:23.138 --> 25:27.100
- Alex!
- I just want a sample.

25:27.392 --> 25:30.979
- Why?
- I don't think it's a copy.

25:39.404 --> 25:41.573
John?

25:47.971 --> 25:50.000
John.

25:58.298 --> 26:02.761
Hey. I'm not going to be away long.

26:02.928 --> 26:08.433
- Well, you better call me.
- Hey! You better call me.

26:08.850 --> 26:13.772
You take care of the place.
You're in charge now.

26:15.148 --> 26:19.402
Come here. I love you, John.

27:00.104 --> 27:03.505
Yeah, that's a cold thing, my man.

27:04.155 --> 27:08.320
- Pretty late for a walk, hey, motherfucker?
- Little boy lost his way.

27:10.245 --> 27:12.022
Hey, fuckhead!

27:12.747 --> 27:15.917
- I'm talking to you.
- Nice blade.

27:43.570 --> 27:47.349
- Gang beating!
- Malloy! Get in here.

27:47.432 --> 27:48.453
- Clear the way!
- Come on, move!

27:48.502 --> 27:51.653
Severe trauma. Internal bleeding,
two gunshot wounds, 38 caliber.

27:51.719 --> 27:54.414
- Vital signs? - Stable. - Lucky guy.

27:54.497 --> 27:56.000
- Notify the police?
- Of course.

27:56.047 --> 27:58.543
What the fuck are you talking about?
These aren't bullet wounds!

27:58.668 --> 28:00.288
- Impossible!
- Stop wasting my time!

28:00.328 --> 28:02.288
- This guy was shot!
- This stuff you should deal with it.

28:02.332 --> 28:03.358
Doctor!

28:04.000 --> 28:05.000
Malloy!

28:05.072 --> 28:06.258
Restrain him!

28:06.298 --> 28:07.816
- Grab hold of him!
- Let me go!

28:07.858 --> 28:09.016
Get me a sedative!

28:09.058 --> 28:13.016
Let me go! You don't understand!
Let me go!

28:17.811 --> 28:20.440
- Take him up to ward 7 right away.
- Ward 7?

28:20.490 --> 28:23.902
You got a problem with that?
This guy's a lunatic!

29:17.000 --> 29:18.100
Well...

29:19.457 --> 29:22.510
It's definitely not a fake.

29:27.215 --> 29:30.134
It doesn't make any sense.

29:33.221 --> 29:36.009
Alex-san, how do you explain this?

29:37.017 --> 29:40.021
- Where'd you find it?
- In the chamber.

29:40.077 --> 29:42.021
It's old, maybe 300, 400 years.

29:42.230 --> 29:45.942
But look at the pattern, the weave.
Certainly not Japanese.

29:46.150 --> 29:51.698
- Looks like some sort of tartan.
- Scotland? That's a long way from Japan.

29:52.023 --> 29:55.243
Especially 400 years ago.

30:13.544 --> 30:20.000
Waterloo, my greatest battle.
If only I'd used my left flank before dawn.

30:20.044 --> 30:25.006
Wellington, you swine!
You are better prepared than me.

30:25.102 --> 30:29.536
- Me, the great emperor Napoleon.
- Keep it down!

30:31.988 --> 30:33.782
Who are you?

30:35.942 --> 30:40.346
Martin. Remember? Your favorite soldier.

30:40.413 --> 30:42.117
- Martin?
- Yeah.

30:42.163 --> 30:44.017
- Is it you?
- Yeah.

30:44.063 --> 30:45.817
My God, what are you doing here?

30:45.861 --> 30:49.129
I had to warn you. You're in great danger.

30:49.279 --> 30:53.592
- I know. It's not safe here.
- Please help me.

30:54.869 --> 30:57.238
Oh, great one!

30:58.472 --> 31:01.126
My mission is not over yet.

31:03.386 --> 31:05.000
What mission?

31:06.486 --> 31:08.000
Wellington. Remember?

31:08.466 --> 31:10.702
I have to kill him.

31:12.562 --> 31:15.114
Nephew, make him suffer.

31:15.281 --> 31:19.535
- Hey, how do I get out of here?
- Leave it to me.

31:23.514 --> 31:26.144
Soldiers, I'm proud of you!

31:26.209 --> 31:30.671
Finally the time has come,
and the time is now!

32:14.915 --> 32:16.192
Shut up!

33:42.470 --> 33:44.522
Highlander!

33:47.224 --> 33:49.352
I am your shadow!

33:50.811 --> 33:55.524
- Where is Kane?
- Don't worry about Kane.

34:00.946 --> 34:02.898
Worry about me.

34:24.203 --> 34:26.346
You've already lost.

34:30.518 --> 34:33.279
There can be only one.

35:39.003 --> 35:41.007
So what do you got, Vorisek?

35:41.053 --> 35:43.400
We got a body here,
and we got a head over there.

35:43.440 --> 35:46.000
Now, I suspect foul play.

35:46.100 --> 35:48.745
Maybe you should've taken over
for Carson, you're so funny, huh?

35:48.879 --> 35:53.975
Look, Lieutenant. We got a guy in a
halloween costume gets his head sliced off.

35:54.058 --> 35:57.370
- It's not your usual humdrum assassination now.
- Where's the sword?

35:57.424 --> 36:00.200
How'd you know about that?
I was saving that as a surprise.

36:00.300 --> 36:04.000
I remember things.
You, you forget, but I remember.

36:04.987 --> 36:07.990
Hey, Lieutenant. You know,
we checked for prints already.

36:08.073 --> 36:10.600
Wasted your time. You won't find nothing.

36:10.700 --> 36:14.037
Somebody broke out of the psycho ward,
came down here and did this hell of a mess.

36:14.081 --> 36:18.475
- Russell Nash.
- You see? He's a genius.

36:18.529 --> 36:20.200
Yeah? So you know the victim?

36:22.229 --> 36:23.589
I know the killer.

36:49.531 --> 36:53.552
Mr Nash? Lieutenant John Stenn, NYPD.

36:54.578 --> 36:57.723
- What do you want?
- Eight years ago, you got away with it.

36:57.806 --> 37:02.286
But I'm not Detective Bedsoe.
I'm goning to nail you, Nash. That's a promise.

37:03.087 --> 37:06.332
Have a good night, Lieutenant.

37:20.270 --> 37:24.105
- Sorry, Charlie. Twenty bucks in my hand.
- Twenty in mine.

37:24.191 --> 37:25.229
- All right.
- You see?

37:25.291 --> 37:27.029
Yo, yo, the brother, the brother.

37:27.091 --> 37:29.709
My brother! Come on in,
come on in, come on in.

37:29.758 --> 37:34.701
Tell you what, you find the red card,
I'll give you $20 right now, man. Easy as that.

37:34.785 --> 37:37.454
You do my magic. Boom. You're on.

37:48.298 --> 37:51.885
- Motherfucker, I never seen that shit before.
- Hey, yo, how'd he do that?

37:53.895 --> 37:56.306
Hey, yo! Yo, gimme back my money!

37:58.733 --> 38:01.645
My glasses! Fuck it, man.

38:01.728 --> 38:04.064
You keep the money, all right?

38:42.185 --> 38:45.022
Welcome back, MacLeod.

39:12.000 --> 39:16.000
<i>Get back in the car immediately, please!
My son...</i>

39:16.161 --> 39:19.556
<i>I have with me American archaeologist,
Dr. Alex Johnson,</i>

39:19.640 --> 39:22.434
<i>who's from the New York Museum
of Ancient History.</i>

39:22.517 --> 39:27.147
<i>Dr. Johnson, what can you tell us about
the discovery, and why is it so exciting?</i>

39:27.356 --> 39:31.610
<i>Well, the artifacts are clearly exceptional,
but only after a much more detailed analysis...</i>

39:31.693 --> 39:35.154
- Sarah!
- <i>...will we be able to speculate as to the identities...</i>

39:38.450 --> 39:40.594
Do I know you?

39:46.291 --> 39:49.078
- No.
- No?

39:50.629 --> 39:52.473
I thought not.

39:54.299 --> 39:57.803
So, what are you doing here?

39:58.345 --> 40:04.000
Well, I may be mistaken, but I had the feeling
that this was the house of Mr. DeFernet.

40:04.100 --> 40:07.261
Well, you're obviously not mistaken.

40:08.230 --> 40:14.068
Connor MacLeod. I see you've met
my rather spirited niece, Sarah.

40:14.112 --> 40:18.731
- She's come here from England.
- It seems I'm in need of taming.

40:18.815 --> 40:21.535
Pleasant challenge... I would imagine.

40:22.160 --> 40:27.000
I invited him for the weekend
to join us at the card table.

40:27.060 --> 40:29.960
- So you're a gambler, Mr. MacLeod?
- On occasion.

40:30.961 --> 40:35.048
So am I. On occasion.

40:35.132 --> 40:39.636
<i>- Any chance of a preview?</i>
<i>- Not at this point,</i>

40:39.719 --> 40:44.682
<i>but some of the more unusual objects
will be lent to our existing exhibition.</i>

40:45.059 --> 40:48.014
<i>However, is it not possible
to be stepping on the site</i>

40:48.059 --> 40:52.014
<i>of the legendary lost cave of the
great Japanese sorcerer Nakano?</i>

40:52.232 --> 40:57.603
<i>As I've said you before, any speculation
at this point would be a little premature.</i>

40:57.863 --> 41:01.897
<i>Well, is it not true, Dr. Johnson, that
supported by your own controversial studies,</i>

41:01.950 --> 41:05.537
<i>that legends can be used to
identify archaeological sites?</i>

41:05.620 --> 41:09.307
<i>It is true that we have seen parallels
between missing sites before.</i>

41:09.391 --> 41:11.243
<i>But what about the inscriptions?</i>

41:11.297 --> 41:14.771
<i>Do they offer clues or is this just
some sort of cave-robbing graffiti?</i>

41:14.854 --> 41:17.291
<i>It's probably just some ancient taggers.</i>

41:17.574 --> 41:21.000
<i>Taggers! Well, Ms. Johnson,
so no idea what it means?</i>

41:21.050 --> 41:22.888
I know what it means.

41:26.473 --> 41:29.728
Cyrillic alphabet, early Russian.

41:32.397 --> 41:36.735
"Tolkah Adeen".
There can be only one.

41:39.613 --> 41:42.365
- Only one what?
- Alex-san.

41:42.449 --> 41:44.826
- Hmm?
- Another fax from Tommy.

41:45.952 --> 41:50.999
"A little something to read on the flight
home. I thought this might interest you."

41:55.570 --> 41:58.632
Well, that's it for me.
I'm off to New York tonight.

41:58.715 --> 42:01.560
Better document that last crate.

42:11.645 --> 42:15.106
The man wants vinyl
when he can have the real thing?

42:15.690 --> 42:18.234
I don't think so.

42:18.902 --> 42:20.613
Come on.

42:33.500 --> 42:38.305
Why don't you come here a little bit
and make yourself comfortable?

42:39.172 --> 42:43.134
You nice, big boy.

42:45.220 --> 42:48.390
Come on, you little devil.

42:48.890 --> 42:53.520
Silent type, huh?
It fine by me, baby.

42:53.603 --> 42:57.941
But I'm telling you, no glove...

43:00.485 --> 43:03.571
...no love.

43:08.410 --> 43:11.663
What are you waiting for, honey?

43:14.541 --> 43:17.669
Come on, baby.

43:28.721 --> 43:31.345
So after three days, this better be good.

43:31.421 --> 43:35.245
Well, it wasn't easy, but I finally
determined the cause of death.

43:35.311 --> 43:37.947
All right, now that we've had
our little joke, what else you got?

43:38.022 --> 43:42.902
Nothing. Besides having his head cut off,
he's in perfect health.

43:43.278 --> 43:47.740
No broken bones, no cavities,
no organ deterioration.

43:47.824 --> 43:49.700
Like a newborn baby.

43:49.770 --> 43:51.494
- Find out who he is?
- He's nobody.

43:51.578 --> 43:54.873
No prints, no dental, no nothing.

43:54.956 --> 43:59.510
It's like he never existed.
So what do you really think, Howard?

43:59.802 --> 44:02.922
I think you better not smoke in here,
Lieutenant.

44:03.006 --> 44:06.217
What's this guy doing in New York City?

44:07.927 --> 44:12.390
- What's he doing on the planet?
- Thanks, Howard!

44:25.904 --> 44:29.699
MacLeods. But I checked it.
Same pattern, didn't match up.

44:29.782 --> 44:32.202
Apparently, this alteration in the color

44:32.285 --> 44:36.456
denotes a branch of the clan
that broke away in, I think, 1536.

44:36.748 --> 44:40.502
Here. Some incident occurred that year
involving a Connor MacLeod,

44:40.505 --> 44:41.800
who was driven from his home,

44:41.905 --> 44:44.964
accused of wielding powers
thought to have been unnatural.

44:45.048 --> 44:48.576
So in defiance, the father altered this
insignia to honor the son's lineage,

44:48.759 --> 44:51.596
but there's been no record
of this branch ever since.

44:51.679 --> 44:54.000
Except for a piece of cloth.

44:54.100 --> 44:57.793
Which could now place one of them
in a Japanese cave a few years later.

44:57.852 --> 45:00.813
Yeah, but what would a Scot be doing there?

45:00.997 --> 45:03.691
What if he was one of these Gaelic mystics?

45:03.775 --> 45:07.570
I mean, Nakano's initiates were said
to have been great sorcerers, right?

45:07.654 --> 45:11.383
- Yeah.
- None of the legends refer to where they came from.

45:11.866 --> 45:15.912
Interesting theory, but,
Alex, no records, no proof.

45:17.538 --> 45:21.709
Once a year, the MacLeods meet
at Dunvegan Castle, Isle of Skye.

45:22.001 --> 45:25.400
According to the registrar,
this entry was made in 1986,

45:25.501 --> 45:30.000
some antique dealer claiming to be a
direct descendant of this particular branch.

45:30.760 --> 45:34.597
- So where's this guy from?
- New York.

45:35.306 --> 45:37.000
They faxed me his address.

45:37.106 --> 45:39.719
What? You're going to harass
some poor guy about his ancestors?

45:40.395 --> 45:43.815
- He's going to think you're crazy.
- Perhaps.

45:44.273 --> 45:47.110
Then again, at this point...

45:47.443 --> 45:51.072
it may be my only link to Nakano.

45:51.280 --> 45:55.576
- Well, I'm off.
- Good night, Tommy.

45:56.536 --> 45:59.747
- I'll tell security you're working late again.
- Thanks.

46:34.365 --> 46:37.618
- What do you call this place?
- Excuse me?

46:38.411 --> 46:42.498
This place, here. What do you call it?

46:42.874 --> 46:47.100
- A museum, but we're closed.
- Museum.

46:47.500 --> 46:51.432
Ah, no, please. I'm your biggest fan.
You see, I saw you on television.

46:51.540 --> 46:54.180
I'm a bit of a historian myself really.

46:55.900 --> 46:57.480
This looks familiar.

46:57.972 --> 47:02.718
Isn't it amazing how the present
just can't seem to escape the past?

47:03.311 --> 47:07.398
- Can I help you with something?
- No, no, no. I'm just...

47:07.857 --> 47:10.554
Just doing a little research.

47:12.500 --> 47:15.754
Look at this cave. Little small, eh?

47:16.500 --> 47:18.909
And what does your museum call it?

47:19.376 --> 47:21.329
- A model.
- A model.

47:21.704 --> 47:23.207
And you?

47:24.457 --> 47:28.424
A vision of a past reality, I suppose.

47:28.477 --> 47:33.916
Oh, reality. No, not reality.
Reality is so boring. I much prefer...

47:35.426 --> 47:38.346
illusion or fantasy,

47:38.429 --> 47:41.265
a little hocus pocus and maybe a little...

47:44.101 --> 47:46.646
Maybe a little bit of...

47:47.438 --> 47:50.608
hanky-panky, huh?

48:02.912 --> 48:06.282
Connor MacLeod.

48:07.375 --> 48:11.254
Don't worry, my prissy, I'll find him.

48:13.089 --> 48:15.500
I'm going to find him.

48:33.526 --> 48:35.987
Burn it down.

49:59.069 --> 50:02.298
I'm outside the Japanese
Spiritual Center in Queens.

50:18.422 --> 50:21.550
- Good to have you back, Nash.
- Good to see you, Charlie.

50:58.800 --> 51:00.000
Come on! Come on!

51:00.714 --> 51:01.967
Come on!

51:47.878 --> 51:51.140
I wish we could go on like this
for a thousand years.

51:57.396 --> 51:59.481
What do you wish?

52:00.607 --> 52:03.027
MacLeod?

52:04.945 --> 52:08.323
That he had better timing.

52:10.701 --> 52:12.494
What do you want, Pierre?

52:14.580 --> 52:17.875
I have bad news. They need you in Paris.

52:18.959 --> 52:22.296
- Why now?
- The revolution has started.

52:22.379 --> 52:24.089
You must leave the girl.

52:27.276 --> 52:31.780
Come now, my friend.
If not for you, then do it for her.

52:41.565 --> 52:44.318
You're not coming back, are you?

52:46.487 --> 52:51.066
You have to get back to England.
It won't be safe here.

52:51.158 --> 52:54.086
No one is safe now.

52:56.000 --> 53:00.743
Connor, take this.

53:24.758 --> 53:27.652
- Russell Nash?
- Excuse me?

53:27.735 --> 53:31.039
- Sorry. Are you Russell Nash?
- What if I am?

53:31.122 --> 53:35.618
I'm looking for, I guess, the previous
owner of your shop, a Connor MacLeod.

53:36.052 --> 53:38.455
You wouldn't happen to know
where I could find him, would you?

53:41.824 --> 53:43.487
Did you follow me?

53:45.746 --> 53:48.634
- Yes, but...
- I haven't seen him in eight years.

53:49.546 --> 53:52.000
Do you know if he's still in the area?

53:52.050 --> 53:54.245
I wish I could help you, Miss Johnson.

53:55.747 --> 53:58.092
How do you know my name?

53:58.775 --> 54:03.171
Well, your discovery in Japan
has made you famous.

54:03.955 --> 54:06.275
You're obviously...

54:06.358 --> 54:09.519
interested in Japan yourself, Mr. Nash.

54:09.820 --> 54:14.499
Strange food, good cars, tough deals.

54:15.533 --> 54:19.400
Listen, it's getting late.
Good night, Miss Johnson.

54:19.500 --> 54:21.623
Look, Mr. Nash, I don't mean to bother you,

54:22.207 --> 54:24.626
but you're my only link
to this Connor MacLeod.

54:24.710 --> 54:27.045
Try the phone book.

54:27.129 --> 54:30.299
There's plenty of MacLeods in New York.

54:30.482 --> 54:33.969
Well, thanks, but I'm only looking for one.

54:35.929 --> 54:38.173
So am I.

54:43.770 --> 54:49.109
400 years is a long time to hate.

54:50.452 --> 54:53.130
And you never wrote.

54:54.698 --> 54:58.560
But hate feeds you.
It focuses the mind.

54:59.003 --> 55:01.955
Keeps you warm.
Gives you hope.

55:02.247 --> 55:04.041
Eh, MacLeod?

55:08.378 --> 55:13.133
Don't worry about the girl.
She's not really my type.

55:13.316 --> 55:16.678
A little too... pale.

55:17.679 --> 55:21.641
Then again, this being the 90s,
I could make an exception, huh?

55:22.559 --> 55:25.812
After all, I've got so much catching up to do.

55:27.022 --> 55:31.493
This is a Buddhist shrine, Kane,
and we can't fight on holy ground.

55:31.610 --> 55:36.414
Oh, well. I guess I'll be the judge of that.

56:54.800 --> 56:56.000
Nothing!

57:16.298 --> 57:19.384
There can be only...

57:19.467 --> 57:21.770
one!

57:34.607 --> 57:39.203
After 400 years, patience is a virtue.

57:48.663 --> 57:52.000
Jesus Christ! I'm going in!

57:58.465 --> 58:04.001
Listen! Whatever you saw, you saw nothing.

58:05.700 --> 58:09.976
You don't know what you're getting
yourself into. Stay away!

58:23.490 --> 58:25.867
Freeze! Police!

58:29.954 --> 58:32.832
One more thing I think
you should know about.

58:33.875 --> 58:38.362
There was a woman.
Worked with us once in a while.

58:38.838 --> 58:42.609
Brenda. Brenda Wyatt.

58:44.260 --> 58:47.500
- What about her?
- Well, she was fascinated by...

58:48.260 --> 58:50.725
the murders, the swords, the whole thing.

58:51.267 --> 58:54.800
Lieutenant, it's what, 5:00 in the morning?

58:54.854 --> 58:58.525
Look! They scraped her off a highway
in Scotland seven years ago.

58:59.442 --> 59:04.914
She was killed instantly,
but he walked away

59:05.406 --> 59:07.784
without a scratch.

59:10.937 --> 59:12.997
Sad for him.

59:15.875 --> 59:20.630
So, are you sure you didn't see anything?

59:26.052 --> 59:29.931
- Miss Johnson!
- Sorry. No.

59:30.014 --> 59:34.270
Russell Nash is a dangerous man.

59:34.353 --> 59:37.605
Now, I suggest you stay away from him.

59:39.732 --> 59:42.402
That's exactly what he said.

01:00:10.763 --> 01:00:13.850
Please, my friend. For the revolution.

01:00:17.645 --> 01:00:19.939
MacLeod! Visitor!

01:00:26.070 --> 01:00:31.500
Calm down, MacLeod. If you die,
we lose a great warrior against evil.

01:00:32.327 --> 01:00:35.347
I'm here to take your place.

01:00:36.456 --> 01:00:40.418
Go home and sleep it off. Come on.

01:00:44.589 --> 01:00:47.467
I'm tired of this eternal life.

01:00:47.550 --> 01:00:50.303
Death would release me from my pain.

01:00:50.386 --> 01:00:54.265
- Come on. Pierre, go home.
- I'm not going anywhere.

01:01:02.774 --> 01:01:05.818
It's time, Mr. MacLeod.

01:01:11.624 --> 01:01:13.576
When he wakes up, throw him out.

01:01:20.917 --> 01:01:22.710
God be with you.

01:01:34.597 --> 01:01:38.142
For treason against the King of France,

01:01:38.518 --> 01:01:40.478
Connor MacLeod.

01:01:49.987 --> 01:01:54.242
Connor! Connor! Connor!

01:01:59.997 --> 01:02:01.374
Sarah.

01:02:16.639 --> 01:02:18.000
Yes?

01:02:18.349 --> 01:02:20.800
Well, it was a very interesting
evening last night,

01:02:20.850 --> 01:02:22.937
but I didn't exactly have time
to check the phone book,

01:02:23.437 --> 01:02:25.607
Mr. MacLeod.

01:02:28.508 --> 01:02:30.000
You want to come in?

01:02:30.945 --> 01:02:32.614
Come in.

01:02:42.832 --> 01:02:46.210
I'll fix you a drink.
Make yourself comfortable.

01:02:48.504 --> 01:02:50.007
Thanks.

01:03:03.311 --> 01:03:06.063
You've got quite a collection.

01:03:38.012 --> 01:03:40.097
- Hello?
- <i>Mr. MacLeod?</i>

01:03:40.181 --> 01:03:43.035
<i>This is Janet at Super Travel.</i>

01:03:43.108 --> 01:03:47.188
<i>I'm calling to confirm your reservation
on the Newark-Glasgow flight.</i>

01:03:47.271 --> 01:03:50.733
<i>Your ticket is prepaid
and waiting at the counter.</i>

01:03:50.983 --> 01:03:52.703
- Thanks.
- <i>Bye.</i>

01:03:52.883 --> 01:03:53.903
<i>Bye.</i>

01:04:02.953 --> 01:04:05.539
Lot of Connors in the family.

01:04:10.878 --> 01:04:13.714
Her name was Sarah.

01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:54.531
Ah, Papa.

01:05:21.532 --> 01:05:24.326
Look, I don't know
what was going on last night,

01:05:24.410 --> 01:05:27.538
but I think it's got something
to do with what I'm working on.

01:05:28.164 --> 01:05:30.791
We found a piece of tartan
in the cave that was traced to

01:05:30.845 --> 01:05:32.754
an undocumented branch
of the MacLeods,

01:05:32.835 --> 01:05:35.754
of which you are apparently
the only member on record.

01:05:36.380 --> 01:05:39.091
That cave was sealed 400 years ago.

01:05:42.052 --> 01:05:46.390
Have you ever heard of the legend
of the sorcerer Nakano?

01:05:47.099 --> 01:05:50.019
Don't you ever think about
anything else but business?

01:05:52.754 --> 01:05:55.741
Do you have something better to offer?

01:05:57.318 --> 01:06:03.000
<i>- It seems I'm in need of taming.
- Pleasant challenge... I would imagine.</i>

01:06:04.199 --> 01:06:08.037
Well, I'm sure you'll let me know
if something comes to mind, huh?

01:06:12.917 --> 01:06:16.587
What's this? Looks familiar?

01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:22.426
Death to the MacLeods!

01:07:00.339 --> 01:07:05.678
<i>My bonny Heather,
my first wife, my first love.</i>

01:07:07.471 --> 01:07:10.933
<i>I came back here because
this is where it all started.</i>

01:07:12.142 --> 01:07:14.561
<i>And I need some strength.</i>

01:09:12.546 --> 01:09:15.349
The last 400 years have been...

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:19.761
...good to you, MacLeod.

01:09:28.944 --> 01:09:31.072
Oops-a-daisy.

01:09:34.743 --> 01:09:37.662
<i>Hi. Leave a message. I'll call you back.</i>

01:09:39.363 --> 01:09:42.626
<i>Hi, it's me, John. I miss you.</i>

01:09:42.709 --> 01:09:44.836
<i>When are you coming home?</i>

01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:47.839
<i>You said you were going to call me,
remember?</i>

01:09:47.923 --> 01:09:51.443
<i>Well, in case you forgot,
it's Marrakesh 1442.</i>

01:09:51.526 --> 01:09:54.596
<i>Love you, Daddy. Bye.</i>

01:10:03.814 --> 01:10:06.817
Daddy.

01:10:11.238 --> 01:10:13.990
Daddy.

01:10:30.782 --> 01:10:32.801
Hey, MacLeod.

01:10:34.678 --> 01:10:37.506
I thought you'd find me.

01:10:40.225 --> 01:10:43.061
Why did you come?

01:10:51.737 --> 01:10:54.156
Nakano.

Maybe I used to.

01:13:24.681 --> 01:13:27.142
But that was a long time ago.

01:13:35.024 --> 01:13:37.354
You spend a lot of time alone.

01:13:38.424 --> 01:13:39.654
I'm used to it.

01:13:40.321 --> 01:13:42.267
Nobody is.

01:13:45.493 --> 01:13:48.000
You don't let people in, do you?

01:13:49.503 --> 01:13:50.832
I can't.

01:13:50.915 --> 01:13:54.127
- It hurts to love and--
- And see them die?

01:13:54.711 --> 01:13:57.172
Like the woman in the painting.

01:13:58.089 --> 01:14:02.260
Yes. I loved her very much.

01:14:06.931 --> 01:14:10.101
I know who you are.

01:14:10.852 --> 01:14:13.980
You're Connor MacLeod.

01:14:14.063 --> 01:14:20.320
Born into the clan MacLeod, in Glenfinnan,
on the shores of Loch Shiel.

01:14:22.697 --> 01:14:27.035
You were driven from your home in 1536.

01:14:29.787 --> 01:14:34.667
- And I cannot die.
- And have wandered the world ever since.

01:16:50.219 --> 01:16:52.039
- Mr. MacLeod?
- Yeah?

01:16:52.079 --> 01:16:53.939
There's a Jack Donovan
on the phone returning your call.

01:16:54.015 --> 01:16:56.101
I'll be right back.

01:17:01.305 --> 01:17:03.858
- Jack.
- <i>What the hell are you doing in Scotland?</i>

01:17:03.941 --> 01:17:08.112
- What do you mean?
- <i>John's on the flight from Marrakesh.</i>

01:17:08.529 --> 01:17:11.574
He gets into Newark
tomorrow afternoon as planned.

01:17:11.657 --> 01:17:15.369
- <i>What are you saying, Jack?</i>
- Is something wrong with your memory?

01:17:15.453 --> 01:17:18.000
I've just dropped him at the airport.

01:17:18.548 --> 01:17:22.743
- <i>Is there a problem?</i>
- No problem, Jack. I'll pick him up.

01:17:22.927 --> 01:17:25.880
Bye, Jack. Thanks.

01:17:34.597 --> 01:17:36.516
Passport, please.

01:17:38.267 --> 01:17:42.021
- You're traveling alone?
- Yeah, but my dad's picking me up.

01:17:43.981 --> 01:17:47.318
- Welcome to the United States, Mr. MacLeod.
- Thanks.

01:18:13.219 --> 01:18:15.346
- Yeah.
- What?

01:18:15.429 --> 01:18:17.700
- They got Nash.
- Where?

01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:18.849
All right, we'll be right there.

01:18:19.308 --> 01:18:22.854
Northwest Airlines, flight 489.
Just landed in Newark.

01:18:23.146 --> 01:18:25.398
Come on, move! Let's go!

01:18:36.325 --> 01:18:39.704
I know he's here somewhere.
I can feel him.

01:18:52.341 --> 01:18:54.527
Excuse me.

01:18:55.845 --> 01:18:59.223
- Excuse me.
- Did you see that?

01:19:00.916 --> 01:19:02.043
Next.

01:19:23.873 --> 01:19:25.833
- Dad!
- John.

01:19:36.427 --> 01:19:38.671
- Freeze!
- Let me go!

01:19:39.513 --> 01:19:42.016
<i>John!</i>

01:19:44.060 --> 01:19:47.855
- Where's the Porsche?
- The Porsche? Get in the car.

01:19:49.573 --> 01:19:51.358
Little punk.

01:20:05.704 --> 01:20:06.915
Who are you?

01:20:08.167 --> 01:20:11.253
I'm a friend of your daddy's.

01:20:14.715 --> 01:20:17.000
- He's got my son.
- What son, Nash?

01:20:17.045 --> 01:20:18.260
There's nothing in your file about a son.

01:20:18.344 --> 01:20:20.900
- You're a liar, Nash!
- You're a fuckin' liar!

01:20:20.944 --> 01:20:21.972
Nash, what son?

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:26.018
Please, stop the car! Please!
Let me out of here!

01:20:26.101 --> 01:20:29.021
"Let me out of here. Please, stop the car."

01:20:29.081 --> 01:20:33.150
Stop, please! Look at the plane!
There's a plane!

01:20:39.907 --> 01:20:42.076
I ain't missin' my plane!

01:20:53.295 --> 01:20:56.632
You take the wheel!
Watch out!

01:20:57.132 --> 01:20:59.939
Give it back
Oh, mother!

01:21:00.845 --> 01:21:05.683
- Okay, guys, I'll take it from here.
- Okay. Good luck, Lieutenant.

01:21:07.768 --> 01:21:11.647
So, Nash, talk to me.
We've got plenty of time.

01:21:19.238 --> 01:21:21.782
- Help, it's a truck!
- There's a truck! Stop!

01:21:32.793 --> 01:21:36.797
Fucking bullshit! Without a confession,
we got nothing on this guy.

01:21:39.216 --> 01:21:42.386
So if we can't charge him,
he's going to have to release him.

01:21:43.429 --> 01:21:46.515
Pretty stuffy, eh?
Need a little ventilation, eh?

01:21:47.154 --> 01:21:49.081
Oops. There goes!

01:21:50.853 --> 01:21:54.523
Now, first rule of safety.
Keep your eye on the road!

01:21:58.485 --> 01:22:00.904
What's that? It's a wall!

01:22:04.158 --> 01:22:07.536
Okay, Nash, you're free to go, for now.

01:22:08.078 --> 01:22:10.289
- Oh, yeah, one more thing.
- What?

01:22:10.372 --> 01:22:14.209
One day you'll make a mistake,
and when you do, I'll nail you.

01:22:14.626 --> 01:22:18.339
- I've heard that before.
- Let the fucker go.

01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:23.427
Your daddy can't save you now, eh?

01:22:25.179 --> 01:22:28.557
<i>MacLeod or Highlander.
Whatever you're going by these days.</i>

01:22:28.891 --> 01:22:30.951
<i>- It's your boy.
- Dad!</i>

01:22:31.352 --> 01:22:34.321
<i>I hope I wasn't too hard on him.</i>

01:22:34.897 --> 01:22:39.276
<i>I'm at the old mission,
Route 1, Jersey City.</i>

01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:41.571
<i>Do come.</i>

01:23:58.355 --> 01:23:59.940
Dad!

01:24:02.067 --> 01:24:05.863
The importance of teaching
young people family values.

01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:08.282
- Smoke?
- Don't touch him.

01:24:09.074 --> 01:24:11.952
- Little punk.
- Come here, John.

01:24:12.035 --> 01:24:14.004
Go see your father.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:18.917
Disappearance in the family.

01:24:19.001 --> 01:24:22.588
It's funny, you know. I thought
Immortals couldn't have children.

01:24:22.671 --> 01:24:25.924
But it seems that while
I'm the master of illusion,

01:24:26.008 --> 01:24:29.636
you are turning out to be
the master of deception, Highlander.

01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:35.000
How did you do it? How did you convince
all those lovely women of yours

01:24:35.049 --> 01:24:37.936
that they were the ones
that couldn't bear children?

01:24:38.020 --> 01:24:41.565
When all the while it was you
and your little immortal pecker

01:24:41.648 --> 01:24:44.192
that really didn't do the pecking.

01:24:44.276 --> 01:24:48.864
Oh, I know.
You must've been very disappointed.

01:24:49.197 --> 01:24:53.368
All those nice years thinking
you were the only one left.

01:24:53.577 --> 01:24:57.080
But, you see, the prize was never yours.

01:24:57.372 --> 01:25:02.377
And now, it never will be. Amen.

01:25:02.669 --> 01:25:07.424
Nice little speech, Kane,
but it's not gonna save your head.

01:25:08.008 --> 01:25:10.385
Where's John?

01:25:11.802 --> 01:25:17.059
Well, come with me.
Come. Where's Johnny?

01:25:38.872 --> 01:25:41.625
<i>Here's Johnny.</i>

01:26:52.070 --> 01:26:54.022
MacLeod?

01:26:57.200 --> 01:27:00.445
- What are you doing here?
- I followed you.

01:27:00.829 --> 01:27:03.248
I just thought I could help.

01:27:24.436 --> 01:27:26.363
Oh, shit!

01:27:29.524 --> 01:27:31.060
Come on.

01:27:42.996 --> 01:27:47.709
Ooh, MacLeod. You're such a lady-killer.

01:28:00.678 --> 01:28:03.016
I can't kill an unarmed man.

01:28:04.434 --> 01:28:06.011
Take it.

01:28:07.354 --> 01:28:10.073
But then again, life isn't fair, is it?

01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.000
Come here!

01:30:23.740 --> 01:30:28.285
I'll see you... in hell.

01:30:29.237 --> 01:30:31.623
I'll be the judge of that.

01:30:51.267 --> 01:30:54.520
There can be only one.

01:32:28.156 --> 01:32:29.782
Dad?

01:32:35.554 --> 01:32:37.540
Dad?

01:32:41.043 --> 01:32:44.005
John.

01:32:58.478 --> 01:33:00.646
Oh, John.

01:33:14.452 --> 01:33:18.456
<i>Will you do somethin' for me, Connor?
In the years to come,</i>

01:33:18.539 --> 01:33:23.044
<i>will you light a candle
and remember me on my birthday?</i>

01:33:24.378 --> 01:33:28.424
<i>Aye, love. I will.</i>

01:33:31.510 --> 01:33:34.847
<i>There's a fresh breeze blowing off the loch.</i>

01:33:37.183 --> 01:33:39.977
<i>The glen is snowy and cold.</i>

01:33:40.061 --> 01:33:43.898
<i>It's the most glorious sight on Earth.</i>

01:33:45.358 --> 01:33:50.029
<i>I've found no place to match it in 400 years.</i>

01:33:50.112 --> 01:33:55.826
<i>I'm back now. With a woman I love
and a son I've taken as my own.</i>

01:34:01.540 --> 01:34:03.838
<i>I'm at peace.</i>

01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:07.000
<i>It's finally over.</i>
