00:33.858 --> 00:36.759
I can't believe my mother
made me take out my nose ring.

00:36.760 --> 00:39.262
How do you think I feel
in this penguin suit?

00:39.263 --> 00:41.481
It's better
than this dress.

00:41.482 --> 00:43.233
I look like
a wedding cake.

00:43.234 --> 00:44.401
Actually, it's
kind of hot.

00:44.402 --> 00:47.270
If you like the whole
virginal daughter thing.

00:47.271 --> 00:49.005
Oh, please.

00:49.006 --> 00:51.124
There isn't
a virgin in the room.

00:51.125 --> 00:53.443
Debutante balls
are such a joke.

00:53.444 --> 00:55.462
Screw family tradition.

00:55.463 --> 00:57.747
I wish I was
raised by wolves.

01:01.085 --> 01:03.787
Mom says you and Uncle
Jamie and Uncle Joe

01:03.788 --> 01:05.221
used to play detective
around the house.

01:05.223 --> 01:06.256
Mm-hmm.

01:06.257 --> 01:07.624
So, you always
wanted to be a cop?

01:07.625 --> 01:09.125
Well, actually,
when I was three,

01:09.126 --> 01:12.162
I wanted to be a fireman
for Halloween. Um...

01:12.163 --> 01:15.065
But Grandpa,
your great-grandfather,

01:15.066 --> 01:16.433
said, "As long
as I'm alive,

01:16.434 --> 01:18.668
"no Reagan will ever
wear a turnout coat

01:18.669 --> 01:20.203
"because the FDNY is nothing

01:20.204 --> 01:22.906
but a bunch of thieves
and glory hounds."

01:22.907 --> 01:23.907
His words.

01:23.908 --> 01:25.108
What happened?

01:25.109 --> 01:27.844
Well, Grandpa found me
the smallest blue uniform

01:27.845 --> 01:30.013
he could find and he let
me use his slapper for a day.

01:30.014 --> 01:32.415
I got so much candy
from shaking down the kids

01:32.416 --> 01:35.118
in the neighborhood,
that I decided I never wanted

01:35.119 --> 01:36.319
to take the uniform
off again.

01:36.320 --> 01:37.320
You never did.

01:37.321 --> 01:39.022
Not until
I made detective.

01:39.023 --> 01:40.590
What other questions you got?

01:40.591 --> 01:44.027
Well, Mrs. Eaton says the point
of oral history is stories.

01:44.028 --> 01:46.329
Mmm, well,
Mrs. Eaton's very smart.

01:46.330 --> 01:47.864
I don't have as many stories
as Grandpa,

01:47.865 --> 01:49.933
but I'll see what I can do.

01:49.934 --> 01:52.102
My feet are killing me,

01:52.103 --> 01:54.771
and if I have to smile
any longer, my face will crack.

01:54.772 --> 01:57.624
At least two more hours.

01:57.625 --> 01:59.809
Let's go get high.

02:02.313 --> 02:04.114
Mrs. Carmichael's
watching.

02:04.115 --> 02:06.216
If we get caught, we're gonna
get in pretty big trouble.

02:06.217 --> 02:07.317
You know that, right?

02:07.318 --> 02:08.618
We won't.

02:16.694 --> 02:18.611
Yeah, jail break.

02:18.612 --> 02:21.197
Right under the
warden's nose.

02:22.733 --> 02:24.934
Come out here.
Come out here.

02:26.937 --> 02:28.071
So you've got it?

02:28.072 --> 02:29.122
Tell me you've
got a light.

02:29.123 --> 02:31.107
Do I ever
not have a light?

02:31.108 --> 02:32.709
Here we go.

02:34.078 --> 02:35.745
Hide. Go, go, go, go.
Hide, hide, hide. Hide, quick.

02:35.746 --> 02:38.014
God.
Who's that?

02:38.015 --> 02:39.749
It's
Mrs. Carmichael.

02:39.750 --> 02:41.751
Quiet,
she'll hear you.

02:48.893 --> 02:50.093
Uh-oh.

02:50.094 --> 02:51.928
Reagan.

02:54.198 --> 02:56.566
No. No, no, no.
I'm on my meal right now.

02:56.567 --> 02:59.169
Yes.

03:00.004 --> 03:02.038
Yes, sir.

03:02.039 --> 03:04.524
Forthwith.

03:04.525 --> 03:06.543
I'm going to have to take a rain
check on the interview, kid.

03:06.544 --> 03:07.660
But it's your break.

03:07.661 --> 03:09.312
Well, my break's over.

03:09.313 --> 03:11.481
They found a body
at a debutante ball,

03:11.482 --> 03:13.083
so I'm going to have to go.

03:13.084 --> 03:15.618
It seems the Chief of D's
is showing off for the Trumps.

03:15.619 --> 03:17.987
What, drive all the way
from Manhattan to Park Slope

03:17.988 --> 03:20.056
and come right back?
It'll take forever.

03:20.057 --> 03:22.025
I'm not going to let you
take the train.

03:22.026 --> 03:23.093
Let me come with you.

03:23.094 --> 03:24.177
No. No.

03:24.178 --> 03:26.096
I'm gonna be a cop.
I got to learn sometime.

03:26.097 --> 03:27.964
Nicky, your mother
would kill me.

03:27.965 --> 03:29.832
Grandpa let you ride along
when you were 14.

03:29.833 --> 03:32.702
Yeah, and Grandpa caught
a five day rip when he did.

03:32.703 --> 03:35.338
You'll get ten if you show up
at the scene at midnight.

03:38.109 --> 03:40.009
Please, Uncle Danny...

03:42.680 --> 03:45.648
Just like your mother.
Come on.

03:45.649 --> 03:46.616
Come on.

03:51.288 --> 03:52.455
All right, Nicky.

03:52.456 --> 03:54.457
In the car
until your Uncle Jamie

03:54.458 --> 03:56.493
gets here to take you home.
You got it?

03:56.494 --> 03:58.061
I told you I would.
All right.

03:58.062 --> 03:59.546
Thank you.

03:59.547 --> 04:00.914
Hey, what do we got?

04:00.915 --> 04:01.965
A cluster.

04:01.966 --> 04:03.166
I locked down the hotel.

04:03.167 --> 04:05.668
Um, they got every
Fortune 500 kid in there,

04:05.669 --> 04:07.303
and they're begging
to let their kids go.

04:07.304 --> 04:08.872
We know if the DOA
is a debutante?

04:08.873 --> 04:10.240
No. There's no I.D.

04:10.241 --> 04:12.609
There's no clothes on
her, for that matter.

04:12.610 --> 04:13.760
Looks like the perp
took the clothes

04:13.761 --> 04:15.111
and dropped them
somewhere else.

04:15.112 --> 04:16.896
I see the vultures from the
press are starting to gather.

04:16.897 --> 04:18.515
You want to have
these uniforms keep them back,

04:18.516 --> 04:20.583
so we don't get a photo op
before we notify next of kin?

04:20.584 --> 04:22.352
Thanks, Jack.
All right.

04:22.353 --> 04:23.420
Hey.

04:23.421 --> 04:25.088
Hey.
Jane Doe's a teenage girl.

04:25.089 --> 04:26.222
Head trauma

04:26.223 --> 04:28.725
and strangulation.
Oh, man. She's young.

04:28.726 --> 04:31.277
Yeah. 16, 17 years old.

04:34.899 --> 04:36.249
Hey, kid. Get out of there.

04:36.250 --> 04:37.750
What are you doing?

04:37.751 --> 04:39.369
Huh? Hey, are you guys
asleep over here or what?

04:39.370 --> 04:41.621
Sorry, sir.
I told you to wait in the car.

04:41.622 --> 04:44.707
Hey. You get back in the car
and you wait for your uncle.

04:44.708 --> 04:46.960
Get in there!

04:46.961 --> 04:49.446

recognized the girl.

05:41.961 --> 05:43.478
The place is full.

It looks like we're about
to have the first riot ever,

05:46.232 --> 05:48.233
in the history
of the Social Register.

05:48.234 --> 05:49.601
Oh, rioting rich people.

05:49.602 --> 05:50.652
I'm sure they'll change
their tune

05:50.653 --> 05:52.320
if the DOA
happens to be one of theirs.

05:52.321 --> 05:55.273
No. It couldn't be
one of our girls.

05:55.274 --> 05:57.642
Why don't you just
take a look at the picture,

05:57.643 --> 05:59.144
and see if you recognize her?

05:59.145 --> 06:00.979
No.

06:00.980 --> 06:03.582
Exactly how many debutantes did
you have here tonight, ma'am?

06:03.583 --> 06:05.917
It's our annual cotillion.

06:05.918 --> 06:08.119
About 50,
from all over the world.

06:08.120 --> 06:09.371
50, huh?

06:09.372 --> 06:11.489
What a tragedy for all
these lovely young women.

06:11.490 --> 06:13.959
We had to stop the ball
before the presentation

06:13.960 --> 06:15.160
of the debutantes.

06:15.161 --> 06:17.195
Oh, yeah.
Well, not to mention the tragedy

06:17.196 --> 06:18.496
of the young woman
who was murdered.

06:18.497 --> 06:19.631
And then
there's that.

06:19.632 --> 06:21.533
You know all these
girls personally?

06:21.534 --> 06:23.235
Of course.

06:23.236 --> 06:26.371
These are society's
most promising young women.

06:26.372 --> 06:27.806
Of course.
Okay.

06:27.807 --> 06:29.808
Take another look.
A real look.

06:33.779 --> 06:35.063
Definitely not.

06:35.064 --> 06:36.948
One of the most
important nights

06:36.949 --> 06:39.317
in this city's social calendar

06:39.318 --> 06:41.620
and it's just been ruined
by some-some nobody.

06:41.621 --> 06:43.288
Probably a street kid.

06:43.289 --> 06:45.757
Yeah. A dead street kid.

06:45.758 --> 06:48.159
She's definitely
not a street kid.

06:48.160 --> 06:49.794
She's in
excellent health.

06:49.795 --> 06:51.830
Yeah, well, you mean,
aside from her being dead.

06:51.831 --> 06:53.698
Good nutrition,
clean skin,

06:53.699 --> 06:55.383
looks like she had
braces on her teeth.

06:55.384 --> 06:57.402
She's somebody's
well-loved daughter.

06:57.403 --> 06:59.371
Okay. So she comes from
a good family.

06:59.372 --> 07:00.572
Somebody report her missing?

07:00.573 --> 07:01.873
You'd think.

07:01.874 --> 07:03.575
I ran her prints
through Missing Persons.

07:03.576 --> 07:04.676
No match.

07:04.677 --> 07:06.428
All right.
Let's take a look.

07:06.429 --> 07:08.930
Forensics come
up with anything

07:08.931 --> 07:10.315
that can help us
I.D. the killer?

07:10.316 --> 07:11.917
Male, from the size
of the hands.

07:11.918 --> 07:13.351
You see the thumbprints on
either side of the larynx?

07:13.352 --> 07:14.920
Yeah.
She's got eight

07:14.921 --> 07:16.721
fingertip bruises
in the back of her neck.

07:16.722 --> 07:19.291
It's up close
and personal.

07:19.292 --> 07:20.659
People are sick.

07:20.660 --> 07:23.394
Well, strangling someone
takes time, and a lot of anger.

07:23.395 --> 07:24.663
Mm-hmm.
Whoever it is

07:24.664 --> 07:26.631
probably knew
who she was.

07:26.632 --> 07:28.199
Whoever she is,
she didn't deserve

07:28.200 --> 07:29.901
to be murdered and
dumped in the trash.

07:29.902 --> 07:31.786
I'll tell you that.

07:31.787 --> 07:33.538
Thanks.

07:33.539 --> 07:36.407
<i>Yes, Baker?</i>

07:36.408 --> 07:39.511
The mayor's new deputy
press secretary is here, sir.

07:39.512 --> 07:41.746
Five minutes early.

07:41.747 --> 07:44.633

Miss Connors?

07:48.020 --> 07:50.355

Sue Connors.
It's so good to meet you.

07:52.892 --> 07:55.226
Nice to meet you.
Welcome to New York.

07:55.227 --> 07:57.662
It's a little bit colder
than Atlanta,

07:57.663 --> 07:59.447
but I'm having a ball.

08:00.366 --> 08:02.400
Please, sit down.

08:02.401 --> 08:04.569
Thank you.

08:05.621 --> 08:08.406
Ah...

08:09.241 --> 08:12.276
So, what can I do for you?

08:12.277 --> 08:15.113
Well, we sent you some material.

08:15.114 --> 08:18.049
We've been inundated
with requests about you.

08:18.050 --> 08:19.718
I've got to tell you,

08:19.719 --> 08:21.920
I've been doing this
a long time, Commissioner,

08:21.921 --> 08:24.990
and I've never seen
such a deluge of media interest.

08:24.991 --> 08:27.125
I am talking about

08:27.126 --> 08:29.794
an in-depth feature
in <i>Vanity Fair,</i>

08:29.795 --> 08:32.063
a fabulous spread in <i>GQ,</i>

08:32.063 --> 08:35.265
and <i>New York Magazine</i>
wants you on the cover.

08:35.267 --> 08:40.572
That would be the
"Ten Most Eligible Men" cover.

08:40.573 --> 08:44.275
Somehow, I don't think
that's for me.

08:45.711 --> 08:47.212
So you've read my proposal.

08:47.213 --> 08:48.213
I did.

08:49.248 --> 08:51.216
Well, you could have
told me that.

08:51.217 --> 08:53.385
You didn't ask.

08:55.320 --> 08:57.022
I've heard you're publicity-shy,

08:57.023 --> 08:58.990
but like it or not,
Commissioner,

08:58.991 --> 09:02.160
this latest incident
puts you on the national radar.

09:02.161 --> 09:03.862
You're a hero.

09:03.863 --> 09:07.032
Getting shot
didn't make me a hero.

09:07.033 --> 09:10.402
Well, the mayor feels
this exposure would be

09:10.403 --> 09:11.669
very good
for New York.

09:11.670 --> 09:13.571
You mean, the mayor feels
that it might be useful

09:13.572 --> 09:15.073
during the upcoming election.

09:15.074 --> 09:17.909
And that would be useful
for both of you.

09:17.910 --> 09:21.846
May I remind you, you serve
at the mayor's pleasure.

09:21.847 --> 09:24.182
And may I remind you
that I have my own

09:24.183 --> 09:26.384
deputy commissioner
of public information.

09:26.385 --> 09:28.286
Hmm. All due respect,

09:28.287 --> 09:30.688
I don't think
you're being well-served by him.

09:35.361 --> 09:37.562
This meeting's over.

09:40.666 --> 09:42.667
You know what I think?

09:42.668 --> 09:44.269
I have no idea what you think.

09:44.270 --> 09:46.438
I think you're dug
into a position,

09:46.439 --> 09:49.040
and you think it's a sign
of weakness to change your mind.

09:50.376 --> 09:52.143
And I resent
your obdurateness.

09:52.144 --> 09:53.511
Good.

09:53.512 --> 09:55.947
There's no reasoning
with someone like you.

09:55.948 --> 09:58.616
You're walled off,
and you don't even know it.

09:58.617 --> 10:00.452
But I see right through you.

10:04.774 --> 10:06.891
Have a nice day.

10:14.283 --> 10:16.568
I swear, if I got to look

10:16.569 --> 10:18.586
at one more businessman
with a wheelie

10:18.587 --> 10:20.288
getting off an elevator,
I'm going to eat my gun.

10:20.289 --> 10:22.207
Oh, shoot me
first, please.

10:22.208 --> 10:23.341
It'd be a mercy killing.

10:23.342 --> 10:24.676
Oh, tell me about it.

10:26.078 --> 10:27.262
Oh, look.

10:27.263 --> 10:29.080
There's our victim
in the polka dots.

10:30.316 --> 10:32.600
Who's the little redhead
she's arguing with?

10:32.601 --> 10:33.685
She's a hooker.

10:33.686 --> 10:35.720
She works the pervs
who like 'em young.

10:35.721 --> 10:37.789
I know because I remember her
when I worked Vice.

10:37.790 --> 10:39.090
She's about 25.

10:39.091 --> 10:40.258
You got a name?

10:40.259 --> 10:41.810
I don't remember.

10:41.811 --> 10:43.361
All right, well,
the M.E. said

10:43.362 --> 10:45.063
that the-the killer
was probably a man,

10:45.064 --> 10:46.498
based on the
strangulation marks.

10:46.499 --> 10:48.733
Maybe these two had a
little girl-on-girl action

10:48.734 --> 10:50.985
planned for the john,
something goes wrong.

10:50.986 --> 10:54.489
Well, either way, she could be
a witness to a homicide.

10:55.774 --> 10:57.542
Of course you were.
That was not bad.

10:57.543 --> 10:58.877
You tell a good joke.

10:58.878 --> 11:00.879
See? You're funnier
than you think.

11:00.880 --> 11:02.247
Yeah.

11:02.248 --> 11:04.883
Hey, Renzulli, I want
to report a crime.

11:10.156 --> 11:12.674
Damn tagger
vandalized my gate.

11:12.675 --> 11:15.593
Hey, Nestor.
That's you.

11:15.594 --> 11:17.395
That's a pretty
good likeness.

11:17.396 --> 11:19.030
He made me fat.

11:19.031 --> 11:20.932
Ah, that's terrible.

11:20.933 --> 11:22.133
Kids today.

11:22.134 --> 11:23.818
Do you have any idea
who did this?

11:23.819 --> 11:25.854
Well, if I did,
I'd handle it myself.

11:25.855 --> 11:27.438
I got a Louisville slugger
behind the counter.

11:27.439 --> 11:28.973
Take it easy, Pops.
All right?

11:28.974 --> 11:31.142
Hey, it looks like they,
uh, signed it, too.

11:31.143 --> 11:32.911
Looks like "TMac""

11:32.912 --> 11:35.580
Well, great.
Now you got a name.

11:35.581 --> 11:37.866
<i>Checking in, sir?</i>

11:37.867 --> 11:41.319
Uh, actually, checking out
is more like it.

11:41.320 --> 11:43.288
You get a lot of hooker
traffic around here?

11:43.289 --> 11:46.424
Um, what hotel guests
do in the privacy

11:46.425 --> 11:47.842
of their own room
is their business.

11:47.843 --> 11:50.494
Okay, but if, uh, one of those
guests wanted a little help

11:50.495 --> 11:52.430
making that transaction,
they'd probably turn

11:52.431 --> 11:53.665
to a smart guy
like yourself.

11:53.666 --> 11:54.933
It's against
hotel policy

11:54.934 --> 11:56.467
to help guests with
illegal transactions.

11:56.468 --> 11:58.353
Kid, I'm not trying
to roust you here, okay?

11:58.354 --> 12:00.471
I just want to know where
the lonely hearts might turn

12:00.472 --> 12:02.840
if they're looking for
a little jailbait or something.

12:04.043 --> 12:06.744
Normally, that information
doesn't come cheap.

12:06.745 --> 12:09.013
Really?

12:09.014 --> 12:11.683
Well, how about I slap
these cuffs on you

12:11.684 --> 12:13.184
and drag your ass
out of here?

12:15.955 --> 12:18.990
I might mention
Elite Escorts.

12:18.991 --> 12:20.124
They're very discreet.

12:20.125 --> 12:22.543
Good. And if I was partial
to redheads?

12:22.544 --> 12:23.995
Ask for Tiffani.

12:24.863 --> 12:27.298
I'll do that.

12:34.757 --> 12:36.707
Um, hi.

12:36.708 --> 12:38.910
It's Tiffani.

12:40.946 --> 12:43.815
Maybe I should join you.

12:43.816 --> 12:47.852
You could soap me up,
get me all clean.

12:47.853 --> 12:51.689
I've been a very dirty girl.

12:51.690 --> 12:55.159
It's just a little extra
for water play.

12:55.160 --> 12:57.128
It's not a problem,
is it, Daddy?

12:58.030 --> 13:00.031
Actually, you got two problems.

13:00.032 --> 13:01.199
One is I'm not your daddy.

13:01.200 --> 13:02.333
Second is you're under arrest.

13:02.334 --> 13:03.618
Turn around.

13:03.619 --> 13:05.203
Come on. Turn around.

13:07.623 --> 13:10.742
It's a shame. You're cute.

13:15.778 --> 13:17.612
Murder? I didn't kill anyone.

13:17.613 --> 13:18.613
Well, this is you and her

13:18.614 --> 13:20.081
on a hotel
surveillance video,

13:20.082 --> 13:21.733
and that's you
hassling her.

13:21.734 --> 13:23.067
And, coincidentally enough,

13:23.068 --> 13:25.286
she turns up, three and a
half hours, dead in an alley.

13:25.287 --> 13:26.738
So?

13:26.739 --> 13:28.790
So, you tell us what happened,
and we'll go easy on you.

13:28.791 --> 13:30.692
What? I didn't know the bitch.

13:30.693 --> 13:32.060
Then why were you
fighting with her?

13:32.061 --> 13:34.028
That hotel is my turf.

13:34.029 --> 13:36.197
She came in looking all nervous,
dressed like me.

13:36.198 --> 13:37.699
I figured she was working.

13:37.700 --> 13:39.867
So, she's on your stroll.
So she pissed you off?

13:39.868 --> 13:42.103
You're damn right. I got
an exclusive with the bellhops.

13:42.104 --> 13:43.538
Was she a hooker, too?

13:43.539 --> 13:45.039
Well, she said she wasn't.

13:45.040 --> 13:46.441
But I told her
to get off my track.

13:46.442 --> 13:47.775
She acted like I didn't know
what I was talking about.

13:47.776 --> 13:48.910
Well, did she tell you

13:48.911 --> 13:50.578
what she was doing there
at the hotel, then?

13:50.579 --> 13:53.081
She said she was meeting
her boyfriend for the weekend.

13:53.082 --> 13:55.216
She looks a little young
for a romantic getaway.

13:55.217 --> 13:58.186
So do I.
Drives the guys nuts.

13:58.187 --> 14:01.022
Oh.

14:01.023 --> 14:02.023
<i>Morning.</i>

14:02.024 --> 14:03.324
<i>Morning, Pop.</i>

14:05.961 --> 14:07.295
How's that shoulder?

14:07.296 --> 14:09.497
Stiff, first thing.

14:16.605 --> 14:19.107
The mayor's got
a new press secretary.

14:19.108 --> 14:20.641
Yeah?

14:20.642 --> 14:22.110
She's a piece of work.

14:22.111 --> 14:23.378
Wants me to do magazine covers

14:23.379 --> 14:25.480
and personal
interest stuff.

14:25.481 --> 14:27.915
Really? What do you think?

14:27.916 --> 14:30.485
I think it got you
in a lot of trouble.

14:30.486 --> 14:32.987
It got me fired.

14:32.988 --> 14:34.822
Then why'd you do it?

14:34.823 --> 14:37.158
Well, I didn't know
that would be the result.

14:37.159 --> 14:38.593
What I was trying to do

14:38.594 --> 14:40.962
was change the perception
of the city.

14:40.963 --> 14:43.998
You remember how wild it was
before we cleaned it up.

14:43.999 --> 14:46.467
And the mayor thought

14:46.468 --> 14:49.604
that I was trying to upstage him
and take all the credit.

14:49.605 --> 14:52.106
Mayor's trying
to turn me into a hero.

14:52.107 --> 14:53.608
We could use one.

14:53.609 --> 14:56.110
You think I should do it?

14:56.111 --> 14:57.979
Don't put words in my mouth.

15:05.120 --> 15:07.121
Can I tell you something?

15:07.122 --> 15:08.890
I don't think I'm going
to have a choice.

15:08.891 --> 15:10.725
Meaning?
There's something

15:10.726 --> 15:11.793
on your mind, Pop.

15:11.794 --> 15:15.463
Francis, you were circling
the drain

15:15.464 --> 15:16.831
when they brought you
to the hospital.

15:16.832 --> 15:18.666
Not quite.

15:18.667 --> 15:21.369
Life is short.

15:21.370 --> 15:23.571
It's over before you know it.

15:23.572 --> 15:26.908
I'm talking about
grabbing a little bit of it.

15:26.909 --> 15:29.677
Having some fun.

15:29.678 --> 15:32.280
You had a life-changing
experience.

15:32.281 --> 15:35.917
Like losing your wife
and your son?

15:35.918 --> 15:38.619
Compared to that,
getting shot's nothing.

15:45.928 --> 15:47.512
All right, so what have we got?
Our girl comes into town

15:47.513 --> 15:49.263
to meet her boyfriend
at the hotel.

15:49.264 --> 15:51.549
And who is he?
Is he a rich guy from the city?

15:51.550 --> 15:53.134
Or a businessman
out of town?

15:53.135 --> 15:55.669
Odds are, he's older. Maybe
he's married. Maybe he's not.

15:55.670 --> 15:57.855
Never sleep
with a married man.

15:57.856 --> 15:59.240
Don't say that too loud.

15:59.241 --> 16:00.725
The sarge will have
a broken heart.

16:02.044 --> 16:03.528
Please.

16:03.529 --> 16:06.680
Anyway, she goes upstairs,
but never comes back down.

16:06.681 --> 16:08.783
Yet somehow she ends up dead
in the alley. How's that happen?

16:08.784 --> 16:11.685
It's too bad they don't have,
uh, cameras on the guest floors.

16:11.686 --> 16:13.488
Yeah, the case
would be solved already.

16:13.489 --> 16:14.989
Can I talk to
you, please?

16:21.547 --> 16:23.898
Look, I was going
to call you.

16:23.899 --> 16:25.199
Yeah, that would
have been nice.

16:25.200 --> 16:27.802
Instead, I had to hear it from
the principal at her school.

16:27.803 --> 16:29.370
I had to hear about
how she's going around

16:29.371 --> 16:31.672
telling all the other kids
about a murdered girl,

16:31.673 --> 16:33.174
and all the gory details
with it.

16:33.175 --> 16:35.109
Well, she said she was going
to talk to you herself.

16:35.110 --> 16:36.644
That's not the point.

16:36.645 --> 16:38.946
You took my daughter
to a crime scene.

16:38.947 --> 16:40.448
You didn't even talk to me about it.
Oh, come on.

16:40.449 --> 16:41.682
For what?
A ninth grade school paper?

16:41.683 --> 16:43.050
I thought she was going
to stay in the car.

16:43.051 --> 16:44.352
She's 14 years old.

16:44.353 --> 16:45.620
What 14 year old
is going to stay in the car?

16:45.621 --> 16:46.854
Okay, well, what do
you want me to do?

16:46.855 --> 16:49.240
You want me to cuff her
to the armrest? What?

16:49.241 --> 16:51.058
She shouldn't have
been in that car.

16:54.029 --> 16:56.097
I'm sorry.

16:56.098 --> 16:58.766
If I could take
it back, I would.

16:58.767 --> 17:00.134
I'm sorry.

17:02.437 --> 17:04.672
Great.

17:04.673 --> 17:06.874
She didn't need this, Danny.

17:14.633 --> 17:16.300
I'm feeling like
a meatball sub.

17:16.300 --> 17:18.419
Yeah? Why don't we hit
that deli on Tenth?

17:18.420 --> 17:19.887
That's a good idea.

17:19.887 --> 17:21.321
Hey. Oh. Oh.

17:21.323 --> 17:22.723
Hey. Well, looky here.

17:22.723 --> 17:25.192
TMac, back in
the nabe of the crime.

17:25.193 --> 17:27.261
Hey, Picasso!

17:27.262 --> 17:30.498
Hey, kid! Stop!

17:33.535 --> 17:34.936
I hate it when they run.

17:34.937 --> 17:36.404
Go around. We'll cut him off.
All right.

17:36.405 --> 17:39.607
Come here, you son of a gun.
Hey!

17:42.377 --> 17:44.462
Stop right there!
You little scoundrel.

17:45.714 --> 17:48.082
Son of a gun.

17:48.083 --> 17:50.885
Hey, Mr. Picasso!

17:50.886 --> 17:52.887
You're mine, kid!

18:00.462 --> 18:03.797
Hey! Hey,
you son of a gun!

18:05.734 --> 18:08.269
Sucker's fast, that kid.

18:08.270 --> 18:11.305
What do you know? A lifetime
supply of spray paint.

18:11.306 --> 18:13.441
And what else?

18:13.442 --> 18:15.809
There you go.

18:15.810 --> 18:17.328
Textbooks.

18:17.329 --> 18:18.879
Bet I know
which he uses more.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.948
Oh.

18:20.949 --> 18:24.518
It's property of Chadmore Prep,
signed out to Mr. Tom Mackey.

18:24.519 --> 18:26.120
"TMac."

18:26.121 --> 18:28.823
I got you, kid.
Dead and stinking.

18:28.824 --> 18:30.291
We have over 1,500 rooms,

18:30.292 --> 18:31.759
and we were fully booked
on Thursday.

18:31.760 --> 18:34.128
Well, we'll need a list.
That's 1,500 perps.

18:34.129 --> 18:35.529
Or more. The
conventioneers like

18:35.530 --> 18:36.897
to bring their wives
or girlfriends.

18:36.898 --> 18:38.349
Not to mention
the body parts.

18:38.350 --> 18:39.667
The what?

18:39.668 --> 18:41.669
Uh, the prosthetic makers.

18:41.670 --> 18:44.205
They've been playing
practical jokes on our staff.

18:44.206 --> 18:46.540
Room service found a
hand in a dinner trolley.

18:46.541 --> 18:48.859
We really need
the list, please.

18:48.860 --> 18:50.011
Okay.

18:50.012 --> 18:51.479
It's gonna take at least a week

18:51.480 --> 18:52.563
to go through all those names.

18:52.564 --> 18:55.616
Yeah, it is.

18:55.617 --> 18:58.285
Unless... you know, we, um...

18:58.286 --> 19:00.221
leak the girl's photo
to the press.

19:01.089 --> 19:03.124
I'm just saying.
Oh...

19:03.125 --> 19:04.709
Come on. You know the media.

19:04.710 --> 19:06.410
A young girl murdered.
They're gonna eat it up.

19:06.411 --> 19:08.829
I'm telling you. It will be
a national story in 24 hours.

19:08.830 --> 19:10.498
Can't hurt.
And headlines is going

19:10.499 --> 19:11.666
to read,
"The police don't have a lead."

19:11.667 --> 19:13.734
Mmm... We make
the NYPD look bad.

19:13.735 --> 19:14.902
For a minute.

19:14.903 --> 19:16.971
Look, we' can't
find the killer

19:16.972 --> 19:19.106
until we know
who the girl is, right?

19:19.107 --> 19:20.808
Headquarters
is going to be pissed.

19:20.809 --> 19:23.427
Yeah. I got one Reagan
mad at me already.

19:23.428 --> 19:24.945
Might as well double down.

19:26.715 --> 19:28.716
In a breaking news update,

19:28.717 --> 19:30.951
the body of an unidentified
teenage girl

19:30.952 --> 19:34.555
was found today outside
an upscale New York City hotel.

19:34.556 --> 19:37.458
Anonymous sources say
the police have no leads

19:37.459 --> 19:39.927
and have not yet identified
the scantily-clad victim.

19:39.928 --> 19:42.697
Is that right?
Oh, she was abducted by aliens?

19:42.698 --> 19:44.565
All right, I'll tell you what.
Give NASA a call, okay?

19:44.566 --> 19:46.083
Good-bye.
It's your daughter?

19:46.084 --> 19:47.702
This is Detective Reagan.
Are you sure?

19:47.703 --> 19:48.953
Uh-huh.
Okay, we'll get right back to you.

19:48.954 --> 19:50.121
I'm so sorry.

19:50.122 --> 19:51.622
Go ahead.

19:51.623 --> 19:53.290
And the name's Betsy?

19:53.291 --> 19:55.042
Okay. Thank you.

19:55.043 --> 19:57.261
It's a teacher from Upstate.
Says the girl's name is Betsy...

19:57.262 --> 19:58.846
Betsy Vickers.

19:58.847 --> 20:00.948
Vickers. I was just speaking
to her father from Brewster.

20:00.949 --> 20:03.918
I'll bring her up on DMV.

20:03.919 --> 20:05.986
Vickers...

20:05.987 --> 20:07.555
Betsy...

20:07.556 --> 20:09.824
Here we go.

20:09.825 --> 20:11.492
16 years old.

20:11.493 --> 20:13.227
She just got
her learner's permit.

20:13.228 --> 20:16.464
Her father said
she was his pride and joy.

20:16.465 --> 20:18.132
He's beside himself.

20:18.133 --> 20:19.784
Well, then the M.E. was right.

20:19.785 --> 20:21.969
She said she probably came
from a loved family.

20:21.970 --> 20:23.904
Who would want to kill
a little girl like this?

20:23.905 --> 20:25.873
An animal.

20:38.580 --> 20:39.747
Here you go.

20:39.748 --> 20:41.916
Thank you.

20:41.917 --> 20:42.952
I just... I just
don't understand

20:42.966 --> 20:44.901
what Betsy was doing
in New York.

20:46.603 --> 20:48.405
Where'd you
think she was?

20:48.427 --> 20:49.660
In, uh...

20:49.661 --> 20:53.297
Skiing in Vermont
with friends.

20:53.298 --> 20:57.334
It-It-It was a reward
for her midterm report card.

20:58.303 --> 20:59.737
She's always struggled
with science,

20:59.738 --> 21:03.407
but this time,
she worked so hard.

21:03.408 --> 21:06.610
So you, uh, didn't know
she was missing, then?

21:06.611 --> 21:07.912
No. I...

21:07.913 --> 21:09.379
You know, we told her
to go on the trip.

21:09.380 --> 21:11.215
You know,
have a wonderful time,

21:11.216 --> 21:14.251
all that, and then...

21:14.252 --> 21:16.487
and then we saw
that photo on TV.

21:16.488 --> 21:20.858
Oh. I'm sorry you had
to find out that way.

21:24.062 --> 21:26.464
Did you call at all?
Check in?

21:26.465 --> 21:29.950
I worried. I wanted to call.

21:29.951 --> 21:32.903
But I told him not to.

21:32.904 --> 21:35.456
Let her have some freedom.

21:35.457 --> 21:38.242
Oh, God.

21:38.243 --> 21:40.444
My baby was dead,

21:40.445 --> 21:41.879
and I didn't even know.

21:41.880 --> 21:43.013
I'm sorry. I can't.

21:43.014 --> 21:45.433
I can't.
We'll go get some air.

21:45.434 --> 21:47.584
Thank you.

21:51.857 --> 21:54.291
A couple more questions,
okay, Mr. Vickers?

21:54.292 --> 21:57.394
Do you know if Betsy
was dating anyone at all?

21:57.395 --> 21:58.729
No.

21:58.730 --> 22:01.031
She-She had boyfriends,

22:01.032 --> 22:02.566
you know, like kids...

22:02.567 --> 22:05.269
She dated a little bit.

22:05.270 --> 22:09.273
She said most of the guys
just wanted to get drunk

22:09.274 --> 22:10.875
and get to third base.

22:10.876 --> 22:12.877
No. She was at home

22:12.878 --> 22:14.478
every weekend.

22:14.479 --> 22:16.614
Hmm. She go online a lot?

22:16.615 --> 22:19.383
Yeah, like every kid
goes online.

22:19.384 --> 22:23.354
Oh, here's the computer
you asked for.

22:23.355 --> 22:25.923
We brought her yearbook
and some other stuff.

22:25.924 --> 22:27.258
I tried to get on it,

22:27.259 --> 22:29.960
but I don't know the password.

22:29.961 --> 22:32.029
It's okay. We'll have our
tech people take a look at it,

22:32.030 --> 22:34.832
see what they can find.

22:41.706 --> 22:44.608
Nicky?

22:44.609 --> 22:46.811
You okay?

22:48.196 --> 22:49.647
What did you see?

22:51.316 --> 22:54.151
Hey. Shh.
I had a bad dream.

22:54.152 --> 22:56.420
Okay.

22:56.421 --> 22:57.922
It's over.

22:57.923 --> 22:59.373
There was this man,

22:59.374 --> 23:01.125
and he was chasing us,

23:01.126 --> 23:03.127
and he caught us,

23:03.128 --> 23:04.879
and somebody
was screaming,

23:04.880 --> 23:07.164
and she was
just lying there

23:07.165 --> 23:09.133
with her eyes open.

23:09.134 --> 23:11.135
Okay. It's over.
It's over.

23:12.504 --> 23:14.471
It's...
Somebody killed her.

23:14.472 --> 23:15.673
Okay, sweetie.

23:15.674 --> 23:16.807
Come on.

23:16.808 --> 23:18.876
It's just a dream.

23:18.877 --> 23:21.679
Shh. It's okay.

23:21.680 --> 23:24.281
<i>Cracked the password.</i>

23:24.282 --> 23:25.749
Couldn't really find
anything juicy--

23:25.750 --> 23:27.384
excuse me--
on her e-mail account.

23:27.385 --> 23:28.569
It was mostly
just gossip

23:28.570 --> 23:30.404
between girlfriends, but,
uh, I found something

23:30.405 --> 23:33.374
kind of interesting here,
on her SocialGizmo page.

23:33.375 --> 23:35.876
It's a bunch of private messages
between Betsy and this guy,

23:35.877 --> 23:37.228
Lee Huntington.

23:37.229 --> 23:40.047
"If I know what love is,
it's because you taught me."

23:40.048 --> 23:41.632
Ah, very romantic guy.

23:41.633 --> 23:43.033
Yeah. It's just,
like, poetry.

23:43.034 --> 23:46.370
Wait, listen to this one.
"You will be mine on Thursday.

23:46.371 --> 23:48.088
I can't wait
to hold you in my arms."

23:48.089 --> 23:49.306
And choke your neck.

23:49.307 --> 23:51.475
She was murdered on Thursday.
Yeah, she was.

23:51.476 --> 23:53.477
Looks like her prince turned out
to be a frog, right?

23:56.097 --> 23:58.482
Or maybe just
a possessive freak.

23:59.651 --> 24:01.986
Either way,
I think we got a suspect.

24:01.987 --> 24:04.104
Uh, well, actually,
I-I looked him up,

24:04.105 --> 24:06.357
and there's no record
of any Lee Huntington

24:06.358 --> 24:07.741
in any
of the department databases.

24:07.742 --> 24:09.493
There's always a first time.

24:10.929 --> 24:12.780
There's something
about that name.

24:12.781 --> 24:13.898
Huntington.

24:13.899 --> 24:16.033
Huntington.
It's, uh, familiar

24:16.034 --> 24:18.335
because it's one of
the large hedge fund families.

24:18.336 --> 24:20.971
Like, the Black, uh,
Blackstone Group.

24:20.972 --> 24:23.173
Ah. Bingo.

24:23.174 --> 24:24.675
Marshall Lee Huntington

24:24.676 --> 24:26.243
was at the debutante ball,

24:26.244 --> 24:28.545
which puts him at the hotel
on Thursday.

24:28.546 --> 24:30.080
Same night as our victim.
Mm-hmm.

24:30.081 --> 24:32.633
I like when rich people
do bad things.

24:32.634 --> 24:34.184
Let's take a ride.

24:35.136 --> 24:37.521
We need to speak to
Marshall Lee Huntington.

24:37.522 --> 24:39.623
Please wait here.
I'll go get him.

24:39.624 --> 24:43.444
This guy's gonna miss
his maid in Rikers.

24:43.445 --> 24:45.796
He may end up being
somebody's maid in Rikers.

24:47.365 --> 24:49.266
You Marshall
Lee Huntington?

24:49.267 --> 24:51.118
Can I help you, Officers?

24:51.119 --> 24:53.337
I'm Detective Reagan. This is
my partner, Detective Curatola.

24:53.338 --> 24:55.239
Excuse me,
but I don't think

24:55.240 --> 24:56.573
you should be having
this conversation

24:56.574 --> 24:57.841
without
Mr. Huntington present.

24:57.842 --> 24:59.009
Who are you?

24:59.010 --> 25:01.128
I'm Howard Markham.
Marshall's tutor.

25:01.129 --> 25:02.313
And this isn't
a good time.

25:02.314 --> 25:03.514
We're in the middle
of SAT prep.

25:03.515 --> 25:04.999
Don't be a
tool, Howard.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.583
Let's see what they want.

25:06.584 --> 25:07.918
I've heard enough
about Lord Myron.

25:07.919 --> 25:10.187
It's Byron. Lord Byron.

25:10.188 --> 25:11.672
And I'm getting your father.

25:11.673 --> 25:15.559
Speaking of names, you
go by Marshall or Lee?

25:15.560 --> 25:16.760
My friends call me Marshall,

25:16.761 --> 25:18.128
but my family calls me Lee.

25:18.129 --> 25:19.964
Why?
Well...

25:19.965 --> 25:21.498
This about that dead girl
at the hotel?

25:21.499 --> 25:24.301
Well, that dead girl has a name.
It's Betsy Vickers.

25:24.302 --> 25:25.436
Do you know her?

25:25.437 --> 25:26.804
No.

25:26.805 --> 25:28.439
Really? Well,
you invited her

25:28.440 --> 25:29.606
to the hotel for a hookup.

25:29.607 --> 25:31.608
What? No.

25:31.609 --> 25:34.545
I was there for the debutante
ball, with my girlfriend.

25:34.546 --> 25:36.447
Or maybe you had
a big night planned.

25:36.448 --> 25:38.482
A little city, and country
action on the side.

25:38.483 --> 25:40.984
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

25:40.985 --> 25:42.202
Don't say another word, Lee.

25:42.203 --> 25:43.787
They have no right
to talk to you.

25:44.989 --> 25:47.124
Howard, you can go.

25:48.293 --> 25:50.294
And you are?

25:50.295 --> 25:52.062
I'm Truscott Huntington.

25:52.063 --> 25:53.564
And what is your business here?

25:53.565 --> 25:56.066
Uh, we're just having a little
chat with your son, sir.

25:56.067 --> 25:58.068
They're asking about
that murdered girl.

25:58.903 --> 26:00.871
You have a warrant?

26:00.872 --> 26:02.139
No.

26:02.140 --> 26:03.474
Then get out of here.

26:03.475 --> 26:05.376
Your son's 18, sir. He can
answer questions for himself.

26:05.377 --> 26:07.444
Go. Learn something, will you?

26:10.648 --> 26:12.816
Well, have a glorious day.

26:14.436 --> 26:16.053
<i>No tags on these walls.</i>

26:16.054 --> 26:18.455
<i>I guess TMac doesn't like</i>
<i>dirtying his own nest.</i>

26:22.327 --> 26:24.495
Hey, kid.
Come on out here.

26:24.496 --> 26:26.530
Man. Look, I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

26:26.531 --> 26:29.333
Oh, well, if you're
sorry, you know?

26:29.334 --> 26:31.702
Please, please. Don't arrest me.
It's gonna kill my mom.

26:31.703 --> 26:33.070
You should have thought of that

26:33.071 --> 26:34.555
before you were vandalizing
private property.

26:34.556 --> 26:36.106
It's not vandalism. It's art.
It's what I do.

26:36.107 --> 26:37.241
It's my passion.
Good.

26:37.242 --> 26:38.308
Now we got something
to talk about

26:38.309 --> 26:39.276
on the way to the precinct.

26:39.277 --> 26:41.261
Please. Just listen
to me. Please.

26:41.262 --> 26:44.515
Just come in. Let me
show you what I do.

26:44.516 --> 26:45.883
It'll only
take a second.

26:45.884 --> 26:47.067
After that,
I promise, I'll go

26:47.068 --> 26:49.553
wherever you guys want me
to go. I swear to God.

26:50.989 --> 26:51.989
Please!

26:51.990 --> 26:54.224
Okay.

26:54.225 --> 26:56.493
All right.

26:56.494 --> 26:58.028
Yeah, you have 15 seconds.

26:58.029 --> 26:59.113
Let's go.

26:59.114 --> 27:00.330
Come in.

27:06.755 --> 27:08.672
You did all these drawings?

27:08.673 --> 27:10.124
Every one.

27:10.125 --> 27:11.375
Yeah?

27:11.376 --> 27:13.844
That's great.

27:13.845 --> 27:17.848
You can pretty up your cell
at, uh, Bridges Juvie.

27:20.752 --> 27:24.188
I got in the School
of Visual Arts early.

27:24.189 --> 27:26.023
Yeah?

27:26.024 --> 27:28.625
I'll be the first one
in my family to go to college.

27:31.496 --> 27:34.631
My two brothers are in jail.

27:34.632 --> 27:36.834
I know I screwed up.

27:38.570 --> 27:41.238
Please. I just...
I just need another chance.

27:43.508 --> 27:45.742
Oh, brother.

27:45.743 --> 27:49.646
Put the cuffs away, Reagan.

27:51.349 --> 27:53.951
You just keep the ink on
the page from now on.

27:53.952 --> 27:56.019
Yes, sir.

27:57.489 --> 27:59.690
Don't make me come back here.

28:02.143 --> 28:04.311
Lucky.

28:06.731 --> 28:08.432
I saw you guys leave here,

28:08.433 --> 28:10.133
but now you're back
here empty-handed.

28:10.134 --> 28:12.936
I told you I wanted
a body. Where you at?

28:12.937 --> 28:14.271
We're close, boss. We are.

28:14.272 --> 28:16.140
We, uh, have
a named suspect

28:16.141 --> 28:17.574
and we're just
connecting the dots.

28:17.575 --> 28:19.743
All right. Good.

28:21.812 --> 28:23.313
I don't know, Jack.

28:23.314 --> 28:24.615
What are you
thinking?

28:24.616 --> 28:26.983
I don't know. I mean,
I know this Lee Huntington kid

28:26.984 --> 28:28.818
looks good for this.
I'm just not sure.

28:28.819 --> 28:30.454
Well, if not him, then who?

28:30.455 --> 28:32.923
I don't know. I mean,
we've got no phone records

28:32.924 --> 28:34.324
of him ever calling Betsy.

28:34.325 --> 28:36.293
Surveillance cameras
don't show him

28:36.294 --> 28:38.828
anywhere near any elevators
going up to any guest rooms.

28:38.829 --> 28:40.797
I mean... Well, he could
have taken the stairs.

28:40.798 --> 28:43.467
He could have.
My gut just says it's not him.

28:43.468 --> 28:45.035
Famous Reagan gut? Please.

28:45.036 --> 28:46.870
I know. But you saw the kid.

28:46.871 --> 28:48.672
I mean, I kind of believed him
when he said

28:48.673 --> 28:50.374
he didn't know
any Betsy Vickers.

28:50.375 --> 28:54.144
Well, Betsy met Lee Huntington
at the hotel,

28:54.145 --> 28:55.846
and she did wind up dead, so...

28:55.847 --> 28:57.247
Is that a coincidence?

28:57.248 --> 28:59.583
Unless it wasn't Lee.

29:01.719 --> 29:04.188
<i>Bless us, O Lord,</i>

29:04.189 --> 29:05.856
for these gifts
we are about to receive

29:05.857 --> 29:07.875
through your
bountiful hands. Amen.

29:07.876 --> 29:08.992
Amen.

29:08.993 --> 29:10.077
And thank you for watching

29:10.078 --> 29:11.762
over Frank Reagan
on that terrible day.

29:11.763 --> 29:13.997
Pass the potatoes.

29:13.998 --> 29:16.083
Grandpa, "please."

29:16.084 --> 29:18.702
I'm sorry, Sean.
Please pass the potatoes.

29:18.703 --> 29:21.838
I would just like things
to get back to normal, okay?

29:21.839 --> 29:24.841
You given any more thought
to that magazine article?

29:24.842 --> 29:26.243
No.

29:26.244 --> 29:27.945
What magazine
article, Dad?

29:27.946 --> 29:30.931
The mayor's trying to hitch his
star to your father's wagon.

29:30.932 --> 29:32.933
Hero by association.

29:32.934 --> 29:34.884
Well, there is
a good story there.

29:34.885 --> 29:37.421
I lit a cigar and got sloppy--
that's the story.

29:37.422 --> 29:40.107
Hey, Nicky.

29:40.108 --> 29:43.527
Cat got your tongue? You haven't
said a word since church.

29:43.528 --> 29:45.262
Yeah, Nick, you doing okay?

29:45.263 --> 29:46.914
'Cause I know
it's a big deal.

29:47.999 --> 29:49.066
What's a big deal?

29:49.067 --> 29:50.033
Nothing.

29:50.034 --> 29:51.368
No. Come on, what?

29:51.369 --> 29:52.569
Yeah, what?

29:52.570 --> 29:53.954
Can we please not talk about it?

29:53.955 --> 29:55.455
Yeah. Why don't we
just concentrate

29:55.456 --> 29:56.607
on our dinner, okay?

29:56.608 --> 29:57.758
Can I please
be excused?

29:57.759 --> 29:59.343
I have to work on
a report for school.

30:03.464 --> 30:05.182
Hey, Nick.

30:05.183 --> 30:07.084
Look, I'm sorry I got
out of the car, okay?

30:08.786 --> 30:09.970
What did I miss?

30:09.971 --> 30:11.588
What do you think you missed?

30:12.991 --> 30:14.524
Oh, come on, Erin.
How long are you going

30:14.525 --> 30:16.260
to stay mad at Danny?
He said he was sorry.

30:16.261 --> 30:17.628
Oh, I don't know.

30:17.629 --> 30:19.813
Maybe until my daughter
stops having nightmares.

30:25.486 --> 30:27.571
She won't even talk to me
about it.

30:27.572 --> 30:29.439
Talk about what?

30:29.440 --> 30:31.508
Shh. The adults
are talking, okay?

30:31.509 --> 30:33.543
She's withdrawn.

30:33.544 --> 30:35.879
And I don't even
know what's going on.

30:35.880 --> 30:37.681
Well...

30:37.682 --> 30:39.716
you know, some of the moms
with teens at school,

30:39.717 --> 30:41.969
they go online to see
what their kids are thinking.

30:41.970 --> 30:43.086
They do?

30:43.087 --> 30:44.254
What did I just say to you?

30:44.255 --> 30:46.456
I tried to friend her.
She blocked me.

30:46.457 --> 30:47.424
So use an alias.

30:47.425 --> 30:49.826
Okay. Rights of privacy?

30:49.827 --> 30:51.345
I'm-I'm an attorney
for God's sakes.

30:51.346 --> 30:53.397
Excuse me.
What do you think...

30:55.099 --> 30:57.601
What did you just say
about a phony profile?

30:57.602 --> 31:00.237
What?
Alias?

31:01.823 --> 31:03.190
Sean wants some milk.

31:08.746 --> 31:10.314
What you working on?

31:10.315 --> 31:13.383
I got to do
this report.

31:13.384 --> 31:16.887
I threw up the first time
I saw a dead body.

31:21.009 --> 31:24.127
You really looking
at that screen,

31:24.128 --> 31:26.330
or are you hiding behind it?

31:31.936 --> 31:34.388
I cried.

31:36.107 --> 31:39.810
I wanted to be a cop so much,
Grandpa.

31:39.811 --> 31:41.945
But I don't think I can.
I'm not strong enough.

31:41.946 --> 31:44.247
You're strong enough.
You're a Reagan.

31:47.885 --> 31:51.922
You're growing up, Nicky.
I'm not going to sugarcoat it.

31:51.923 --> 31:55.025
I've cried.

31:55.026 --> 31:58.628
But I learned pretty quick
that you can't be a cop,

31:58.629 --> 32:02.499
especially a good cop, if you
let your emotions take over.

32:02.500 --> 32:06.503
So... you sit on them.

32:06.504 --> 32:09.373
You push them way down.

32:09.374 --> 32:12.943
I don't know whether
that's a good thing,

32:12.944 --> 32:15.112
but it's a necessary thing.

32:16.581 --> 32:18.348
I had a partner
who always said,

32:18.349 --> 32:21.551
"Cops can't cry,
so that their city can."

32:24.255 --> 32:26.590
Do you pay a price?

32:26.591 --> 32:29.192
I think so.

32:29.193 --> 32:33.163
But it's the price you pay
for the privilege.

32:33.164 --> 32:36.032
You're 14 going on 40.

32:36.033 --> 32:38.034
But you're still 14.

32:38.035 --> 32:41.738
You got time.

32:41.739 --> 32:44.641
But if that's
what you decide you want,

32:44.642 --> 32:48.044
you're my granddaughter,
you're strong enough.

32:52.083 --> 32:54.384
You better give Sean his milk.

32:57.555 --> 33:00.123
I made that up.

33:10.268 --> 33:12.702
<i>Okay, so we're looking for an alias.</i>

33:12.703 --> 33:14.121
We got two profile pages

33:14.122 --> 33:15.806
supposedly belonging
to the same kid.

33:15.807 --> 33:16.973
One under Marshall Huntington.

33:16.974 --> 33:18.108
The other one's
under Lee Huntington.

33:18.109 --> 33:19.843
Right, but he says
he goes by both names.

33:19.844 --> 33:21.661
Yeah, but if you look
at the Marshall page,

33:21.662 --> 33:23.914
there's nothing connecting
him to Betsy Vickers.

33:23.915 --> 33:26.550
It's the Lee page that's got all
the romancing stuff going on.

33:26.551 --> 33:28.385
I mean, which name did he say
his friends call him, again?

33:28.386 --> 33:30.470
He said "Marshall""
Which makes sense.

33:30.471 --> 33:32.556
I mean, the Marshall page
is... sounds like a kid.

33:32.557 --> 33:36.059
"BTW, homes,
that video made me LMAO."

33:36.060 --> 33:37.427
But now look at the Lee page.

33:37.428 --> 33:38.862
Yeah. It says, "Sorry you had

33:38.863 --> 33:40.096
"a bad day, my friend.

33:40.097 --> 33:42.032
By the way,
I love your profile picture."

33:42.033 --> 33:44.067
Doesn't sound like a kid
saying that stuff.

33:44.068 --> 33:45.268
No.
Especially not this kid.

33:45.269 --> 33:46.903
Yeah, they used
an alias.

33:46.904 --> 33:48.371
Seems like there's two different
people writing this.

33:48.372 --> 33:50.524
Well, somebody was definitely

33:50.525 --> 33:51.975
seducing Betsy Vickers online,

33:51.976 --> 33:54.194
but I don't think
it was Marshall Huntington.

33:58.340 --> 33:59.841
We need to figure out who set up

33:59.842 --> 34:03.428
that Lee Huntington account
on SocialGizmo.

34:03.429 --> 34:06.180
Don't worry about it.
We got wonderboy on the case.

34:06.181 --> 34:07.432
He'll find something.

34:07.433 --> 34:09.150
Hey. I can hear you in here.

34:09.150 --> 34:12.954
Good. Then shut your mouth
and keep working.

34:12.955 --> 34:15.956
Uh, okay,
I think I got it.

34:15.958 --> 34:18.659
Ask you you
shall receive.

34:18.661 --> 34:20.728
What do you got
for us, wonderboy.

34:20.728 --> 34:22.297
The lead account was set up

34:22.297 --> 34:24.498
on a computer
at the Huntington's.

34:24.500 --> 34:27.101
Are you sure?
Yeah. I triple checked.

34:27.101 --> 34:28.870
The billing's going
to Truscott Lee Huntington.

34:28.871 --> 34:30.338
So what?
So the dad kills Betsy

34:30.339 --> 34:32.373
and let's the son
take the fall for it?

34:32.373 --> 34:33.741
I believe that.

34:33.742 --> 34:35.109
The way the guy was looking
at me, he's a predator for sure.

34:35.110 --> 34:37.679
All right. Well, what about
this tutor-- Howard?

34:37.679 --> 34:40.181
I mean, he had access
to the computer, too.

34:40.181 --> 34:41.849
Well, he seems
harmless to me.

34:41.850 --> 34:43.518
Maybe. He's 30 years old,
he's educated

34:43.518 --> 34:45.386
and what does he do
for a living?

34:45.387 --> 34:47.188
He spends all his time
giving his knowledge

34:47.188 --> 34:48.473
to some spoiled
Richie Rich kid.

34:48.474 --> 34:50.458
If he's not happy
at his job, you never know.

34:50.458 --> 34:52.193
And he didn't have
a wedding ring on.

34:52.194 --> 34:54.128
So if you're single
and you're unhappy at work,

34:54.129 --> 34:55.396
you're a suspect for murder?

34:55.397 --> 34:58.066
Let's go take a look
at the hotel registry again.

34:59.902 --> 35:02.003
<i>Hey, Howard.</i>

35:03.322 --> 35:04.622
I want to thank you
for coming down.

35:04.623 --> 35:06.440
We don't want
to waste

35:06.441 --> 35:09.410
too much of your time,
but we need your help.

35:09.411 --> 35:11.212
To be honest,
we want you

35:11.213 --> 35:13.297
to kind of give us the scoop
on the Huntingtons.

35:13.298 --> 35:16.017
I signed a non-disclosure
agreement.

35:16.018 --> 35:18.186
Mr. Huntington could sue me.

35:18.187 --> 35:19.337
Well, that's fine.

35:19.338 --> 35:21.422
We'll just keep everything
between us.

35:21.423 --> 35:23.024
Do you think he did it?

35:23.025 --> 35:24.125
I don't know.

35:24.126 --> 35:25.259
What's he like?

35:25.260 --> 35:27.996
He's a bully.

35:27.997 --> 35:30.932
He's boorish, rude.

35:30.933 --> 35:32.266
He's awful to Marshall.

35:32.267 --> 35:34.435
Calls him, "My moron son."

35:34.436 --> 35:36.671
Well, the school says
he gets straight "A's."

35:36.672 --> 35:38.906
Because he father pays me
to do his homework.

35:38.907 --> 35:39.941
Oh.

35:39.942 --> 35:41.376
That's got to be
frustrating, hmm?

35:41.377 --> 35:44.145
You do all the kid's homework,
you do all the hard work

35:44.146 --> 35:46.364
and he just gets everything
handed to him on

35:46.365 --> 35:47.715
a silver platter.

35:47.716 --> 35:50.818
I feel bad for Marshall.

35:50.819 --> 35:52.854
He'll never know how it feels
to earn something.

35:52.855 --> 35:57.458
He definitely doesn't know what
it's like to romance a girl.

35:57.459 --> 36:00.795
Not without his good looks
and his father's money.

36:02.097 --> 36:04.032
But you know how to romance
a girl, don't you?

36:04.033 --> 36:05.833
I mean the right way.

36:05.834 --> 36:12.190
With words, poetry,
stimulating conversation.

36:12.191 --> 36:16.044
And that's why you set up
the Lee Huntington profile page.

36:16.045 --> 36:17.712
Isn't it?

36:19.715 --> 36:22.283
Yeah. See,
the words gave it away.

36:22.284 --> 36:23.918
Wait, that wasn't me.

36:23.919 --> 36:25.119
Sure it was.

36:25.120 --> 36:27.388
I mean you all but said
Marshall was a dumb brat.

36:27.389 --> 36:28.823
What kind
of dumb brat's

36:28.824 --> 36:31.559
going to go around quoting
Lord Byron and Emily Dickinson?

36:31.560 --> 36:34.395
I mean the poetry, the romance--

36:34.396 --> 36:36.664
it worked.

36:36.665 --> 36:38.299
Betsy fell in love with you.

36:38.300 --> 36:41.202
Well, she fell in love
with Lee Huntington.

36:41.203 --> 36:44.338
And she went to the hotel
that night

36:44.339 --> 36:48.176
expecting to find
some teenage poet.

36:48.177 --> 36:51.045
But instead she found you.

36:51.046 --> 36:52.897
No. I wasn't there.

36:52.898 --> 36:54.082
Yes, you were.

36:54.083 --> 36:56.250
You checked in under the name
George Byron.

36:56.251 --> 36:59.020
That's Lord Byron's
real name.

36:59.021 --> 37:02.757
Yeah, see, we did our homework
and checked the hotel registry.

37:02.758 --> 37:06.494
It was me she was in love with.

37:06.495 --> 37:08.329
I thought she'd understand.

37:08.330 --> 37:09.263
Understand what?

37:09.264 --> 37:11.165
That her teenage
dream boy

37:11.166 --> 37:13.367
turned out to be a 30-year-old
pervert?

37:13.368 --> 37:15.236
I don't think so.

37:15.237 --> 37:18.339
She didn't love you,
and that's why you killed her.

37:18.340 --> 37:20.508
I didn't, I didn't.

37:20.509 --> 37:22.043
Yes, you did.

37:22.044 --> 37:24.178
Because you couldn't handle
the rejection.

37:26.949 --> 37:29.417
So why don't you just tell us
what happened, Howard.

37:30.252 --> 37:33.121
She got upset.

37:33.122 --> 37:35.790
She called me a dirty old man.

37:37.459 --> 37:40.027
She said she was going
to call her parents.

37:40.028 --> 37:43.865
I... I told her it was me
she fell in love with--

37:43.866 --> 37:46.567
me and my words.

37:46.568 --> 37:50.171
I tried to calm her down,
but she fought me

37:50.172 --> 37:53.941
and then she started screaming
and yelling at me.

37:53.942 --> 37:56.811
So I... I didn't...

37:56.812 --> 37:59.780
I just needed to make her stop.

38:00.582 --> 38:03.017
So you choked
the life out of her.

38:07.005 --> 38:09.323
I just wanted her to love me.

38:18.867 --> 38:20.601
Nicky's very strong.

38:20.602 --> 38:22.687
She's going to be
fine, sweetheart.

38:22.688 --> 38:25.506
I know. I just...
I never expected her

38:25.507 --> 38:27.158
to have to deal
with something like this

38:27.159 --> 38:29.710
on top of everything else
that she's going through.

38:29.711 --> 38:33.030
Well, she's lucky she has a very
good mother looking out for her.

38:33.031 --> 38:35.499
Nicky's got a lot
of growing up to do.

38:35.500 --> 38:37.718
Who knows where she's
going to end up on this.

38:37.719 --> 38:39.787
A cop.

38:39.788 --> 38:42.390
Why not a doctor or a journalist
or a lawyer?

38:42.391 --> 38:44.292
What is so wrong
with being a lawyer?

38:44.293 --> 38:46.360
What kind of lawyer?

38:48.297 --> 38:52.033
She's... It's going by so fast.

38:52.868 --> 38:57.004
It does. Too fast.

38:57.005 --> 39:02.693
Look, Erin, Danny feels
terrible about this.

39:02.694 --> 39:04.412
I'll be outside.
Danny...

39:04.413 --> 39:06.847
Miss Connors.

39:06.848 --> 39:08.316
Commissioner.

39:08.317 --> 39:10.451
Please sit.

39:10.452 --> 39:12.420
Uh, this is my
daughter Erin.

39:12.421 --> 39:13.821
Hi.

39:13.822 --> 39:17.225
Miss Connor is the mayor's
new deputy press secretary.

39:17.226 --> 39:18.559
Congratulations.

39:18.560 --> 39:21.529
Thank you.
Nice to meet you.

39:21.530 --> 39:23.598
I didn't mean
to disturb your breakfast.

39:23.599 --> 39:26.267
Yet, here we are.

39:28.036 --> 39:30.504
I just wanted to apologize
for the other day.

39:30.505 --> 39:32.740
There was no need
to make it personal.

39:36.645 --> 39:38.279
Well, it takes two.

39:39.114 --> 39:41.115
And I do tend to dig in.

39:44.620 --> 39:45.987
Nice meeting you.

39:45.988 --> 39:47.554
You, too.

39:54.246 --> 39:56.080
What was that about?

39:56.081 --> 39:59.583
The mayor wants to make
a hero out of me.

40:00.469 --> 40:03.037
She's very attractive.

40:03.038 --> 40:06.841
She insulted my DCPI
and called me obdurate.

40:06.842 --> 40:09.477
Obdurate.

40:09.478 --> 40:13.814
Well... you can be obdurate.

40:13.815 --> 40:16.600
Well, thank you.

40:23.992 --> 40:26.127
Dad, do you think it's time

40:26.128 --> 40:29.196
that you start thinking about
getting on with your life?

40:29.197 --> 40:32.533
You've been talking
to Grandpa.

40:32.534 --> 40:35.436
No, I don't need to talk
to Grandpa to know

40:35.437 --> 40:37.772
that you've been through a
life-changing experience, and...

40:37.773 --> 40:39.307
Let's see-- life-changing.

40:39.308 --> 40:40.975
You mean like going through
a divorce?

40:40.976 --> 40:43.210
You need to get on
with your life.

40:43.211 --> 40:45.963
I asked you first.

40:47.316 --> 40:49.917
And what was the question again?

40:49.918 --> 40:54.955
Do you think it's time you start
thinking about moving on?

40:54.956 --> 40:57.658
How do you know I haven't?

41:06.018 --> 41:07.468
Hey, Renzulli.

41:07.469 --> 41:10.604
Hey, Nestor, my friend,
how are you? What's up?

41:10.605 --> 41:11.939
I'll tell you what's up.

41:11.940 --> 41:14.809
That damn kid tagged
my store again.

41:14.810 --> 41:15.943
Oh, yeah?

41:15.944 --> 41:17.745
So much
for second chances.

41:17.746 --> 41:20.014
Go on laugh.

41:20.015 --> 41:22.316
Oh, come on, Renzulli, laugh.

41:22.317 --> 41:24.418
Or maybe this time
you won't think it's so funny.

41:33.678 --> 41:37.598
I told you
that kid had talent.

41:37.599 --> 41:40.017
Is that us?

41:40.018 --> 41:41.519
I think it's us.
Yeah.

41:41.520 --> 41:45.389
I guess he saved the
best for last, huh?

41:47.809 --> 41:50.728
Fine. When you lost at trial,
it'll be 25 to life.

41:52.481 --> 41:53.680
Always a hard-ass, huh?

41:53.681 --> 41:55.683
Runs in the family, doesn't it?

41:55.684 --> 41:58.069
Yeah, pretty much.

41:58.070 --> 42:02.373
Look, I wanted to come by
and tell you that

42:02.374 --> 42:04.392
I know I screwed up.

42:04.393 --> 42:07.895
And you've got
every right to be mad.

42:07.896 --> 42:10.331
Though I...

42:10.332 --> 42:15.136
I wish you
wouldn't be anymore.

42:15.137 --> 42:18.539
Want to be friends again?

42:18.540 --> 42:21.725
You're such a pain
in the ass, you know.

42:21.726 --> 42:26.046
Yeah, well,
I'm a Reagan.
