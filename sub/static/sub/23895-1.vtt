01:25.083 --> 01:26.874

My name is Britton Buchanan.
I'm 17 years old.

03:31.250 --> 03:32.999
Just recently,
somebody told me I look like

03:33.000 --> 03:35.082
a 1990s Matt Damon.

03:35.083 --> 03:37.999
It's very subjective, but okay.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.582
I like to have fun, whatever that means.

03:41.583 --> 03:43.416
I'm from Sanford, North Carolina.

03:43.417 --> 03:45.999
It's not small enough for
everybody to know everybody,

03:46.000 --> 03:47.874
but we at least know of everybody,

03:47.875 --> 03:50.832
so you don't do anything stupid
'cause everybody's gonna know.

03:50.833 --> 03:52.874
We have a very dry sense of humor.

03:52.875 --> 03:54.707
She has all these videos
of me getting scared.

03:54.708 --> 03:56.416
- What is that?!
- Oh! Quit!

03:56.417 --> 03:58.082
- Oh!
- Aah!

03:58.083 --> 04:00.249
- Ow!
- Mom, quit!

04:00.250 --> 04:01.541
I don't think they're as funny

04:01.542 --> 04:03.374
as everybody else thinks they are.

04:03.375 --> 04:05.207
He was not an athlete.

04:05.208 --> 04:09.291
Britton would stay in
the outfield and pick flowers.

04:09.292 --> 04:11.916
I figured then this was not gonna work.

04:11.917 --> 04:15.291
But we bought him a $60 guitar,

04:15.292 --> 04:17.916
and then one day, it just clicked.

04:17.916 --> 04:22.291
When I was 13, I joined
a classic rock cover band.

04:22.292 --> 04:24.416
Music was like freedom

04:24.417 --> 04:26.791
where I can be different
than everybody else.

04:26.792 --> 04:30.541
I'm just so proud of what he's
able to do and where he's come,

04:30.542 --> 04:34.541

the kind of person that he is.

this enormous blessing.

04:38.875 --> 04:41.291
I know what it feels like to not fit in.

04:41.292 --> 04:43.041

04:43.042 --> 04:45.082
"Hey, you're invited to the party."

04:45.083 --> 04:47.791

07:20.458 --> 07:22.207
Well, I'm gonna tell you something.
They're afraid of me, Britton.

07:23.542 --> 07:25.749
They are very afraid of you.

07:25.750 --> 07:26.986

07:32.708 --> 07:33.916
What are you talking about?

07:33.917 --> 07:35.291
By the way, you're a great singer,

07:35.292 --> 07:37.166
but Academy Award winner you are not.

07:37.167 --> 07:39.166
- Um...
- I didn't.

07:39.167 --> 07:40.624
So listen, Britton, I'm a huge fan.

07:40.625 --> 07:42.735
You did "I Love L.A."

07:42.760 --> 07:44.655
- with Randy Newman a couple years ago.
- I did.

07:44.680 --> 07:47.249
And I watch that video
like 80 times every week,

07:47.250 --> 07:48.582
and it's freakin' awesome, so...

07:48.583 --> 07:50.143
- Ooh.
- Oh, and you got blocked.

07:50.168 --> 07:52.166
He blocked the right person.

07:52.167 --> 07:54.457
Aw, man, I got so blocked.

07:54.458 --> 07:57.957
But look, I think 100%,
you got to go with Alicia Keys

07:57.958 --> 07:59.791
- because...
- Oh, my God.

07:59.792 --> 08:02.124
...I am such a fan of hers.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.837
I'm literally nervous that
I'm sitting next to her right now,

08:03.861 --> 08:05.630
- because I love her so much.
- She is pretty cool.

08:05.655 --> 08:08.082
Britton, your voice
has so much honesty in it,

08:08.083 --> 08:09.624
and there was something
so genuine about you.

08:09.625 --> 08:11.624
- Thank you.
- I go on emotion.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.916
I feel like that's
what makes music real,

08:13.917 --> 08:17.624
and I'd love to help you really bring
that out for people to be moved.

08:17.625 --> 08:19.666
Damn, you're good. You're good.

08:19.667 --> 08:21.541
- Thank you. I appreciate it.
- You're welcome.

08:25.958 --> 08:27.803
Britton, I just want to talk
to you for a minute, buddy.

08:27.828 --> 08:29.629
- All right, you go ahead.
- You might as well just not.

08:29.630 --> 08:31.183
- I mean...
- He always uses the word "buddy."

08:31.208 --> 08:33.374
I am getting kicked around.
I'm getting blamed for stuff.

08:33.375 --> 08:36.374
- So, listen. You are so intense.
- Thank you.

08:36.375 --> 08:38.499
It's almost like
you're angry at the song,

08:38.500 --> 08:40.166
playing that guitar with such strength.

08:40.167 --> 08:41.791
When I heard you singing,

08:41.792 --> 08:44.791
with a little bit of
a gravelly, raspy tone to it

08:44.792 --> 08:47.207
and a little bit of country...
a little bit.

08:47.208 --> 08:49.666
You made my mom happy right there.

08:49.667 --> 08:51.166
Whoo!

08:51.167 --> 08:53.374
- Okay, I did block Adam...
- Yes, and by...

08:53.375 --> 08:55.353
...and the reason I blocked Adam is
'cause I want you on my damn team.

08:55.378 --> 08:56.298
Wait. Hold on, hold on.

08:56.322 --> 08:57.368
- I got to say one thing.
- That's the truth, man. I'm sorry.

08:57.393 --> 08:59.541
Everybody, Blake Shelton
actually did block me.

09:01.333 --> 09:02.499
Boo!

09:02.500 --> 09:04.416
That was good!

09:04.417 --> 09:07.499
- You're a tremendously great liar.
- Thank you.

09:07.500 --> 09:09.374

09:10.708 --> 09:12.582
I had no idea. You know what, though?

09:12.583 --> 09:15.249

saying, and he chose you.

09:15.250 --> 09:16.962

09:16.986 --> 09:18.541
- this entire season.
- Okay.

09:18.542 --> 09:20.065
- So if you pick Alicia,
- One block.

09:20.089 --> 09:23.707

09:53.875 --> 09:56.624
That's my man!
That's my man right there.

09:58.083 --> 09:59.957
- Come on, man.
- Oh, yeah!

09:59.958 --> 10:01.582
Britton was fantastic.

10:01.583 --> 10:04.707
Something about him
was very pure and very genuine.

10:04.708 --> 10:07.249
I'm telling you, this guitar,
that voice, that soul,

10:07.250 --> 10:09.624
me and you?

10:09.625 --> 10:11.749
I got my first artist, y'all.

10:11.750 --> 10:14.124
I did win the last time I was here,

10:14.125 --> 10:15.916
and I'm looking to win again.

10:15.917 --> 10:17.374
Bye, Blake!

10:17.375 --> 10:18.874
Congratulations, brother.

10:18.875 --> 10:20.457
- Hey, thank you.
- I'm happy for you.

10:20.458 --> 10:22.999
The Block is an absolute game changer.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.666
I threw my block out there to
keep Adam from getting that guy.

10:25.667 --> 10:28.832
And even though I didn't get
him, neither did Adam.

10:28.833 --> 10:30.749
I wasn't expecting that to happen.

10:30.750 --> 10:32.291
That was neat.

10:32.292 --> 10:34.457
The first block of the season...
that's crazy.

10:34.458 --> 10:36.999
- Whoo!
- Congratulations.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.166
- Thank you.
- I went with Alicia because

10:39.167 --> 10:41.166
I love her music, I love her voice,

10:41.167 --> 10:44.457
and I think that she could really
push me in a cool direction.

10:44.458 --> 10:46.791
- The good news is you're out of blocks!
- Well...

10:46.792 --> 10:51.499
And you didn't get the dude,
which is even better.

10:51.500 --> 10:53.582
Oh, my gosh. You're a good liar.

10:53.583 --> 10:54.916

10:58.667 --> 11:01.166

12:18.333 --> 12:20.749
Action!

12:20.750 --> 12:23.082
I'm Brynn Cartelli, I'm 14 years old,

12:23.083 --> 12:24.999
and I'm from Longmeadow, Massachusetts.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.666
When I was 4 years old,

12:26.667 --> 12:29.457
my mom showed me the song
"Breakaway" by Kelly Clarkson.

12:29.458 --> 12:31.124
♪ Grew up in a small town ♪

12:31.125 --> 12:32.707

12:32.708 --> 12:35.082
I really connected with that,
so from then on,

12:35.083 --> 12:37.291
I just knew I want
to keep going with this.

12:37.292 --> 12:41.291
After that, my family got me
into playing piano,

12:41.292 --> 12:44.249
and I started writing my own songs.

12:44.250 --> 12:47.457
I just started high school.
So I go to school all day.

12:47.458 --> 12:51.291
I play field hockey or lacrosse
for hours after school,

12:51.292 --> 12:54.791
and then I come home and fit
music somewhere because I know

12:54.792 --> 12:56.957
without it, I definitely
don't have a good day.

12:59.458 --> 13:01.749
I am so proud of Brynn.

13:01.750 --> 13:03.000
Um...

13:04.583 --> 13:06.541
She works so hard
at everything she does.

13:06.542 --> 13:10.499
For Brynn to have this opportunity
at 14 years old is truly amazing.

13:10.500 --> 13:13.499
And I think she's gonna do great.

13:13.500 --> 13:16.332
'Cause I'm so young
and living in a small town,

13:16.333 --> 13:19.416
it's very difficult to find
big venues to sing at.

13:19.417 --> 13:21.291
I play at school events,

13:21.292 --> 13:23.249
town events, and other things like that.

13:23.250 --> 13:27.249
A coach can help me be something
more than I ever thought I could be.

13:27.250 --> 13:29.416
For my blind, I will be singing
"Beneath Your Beautiful."

13:29.417 --> 13:31.082
This song is about what is inside

13:31.083 --> 13:32.999
instead of what is on the outside.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.916
This is perfect because
when I'm stepping on the stage,

13:35.917 --> 13:38.249
they're not going to be
seeing me, the 14-year-old.

13:38.250 --> 13:40.582
They're gonna be hearing
my soul in my song.

13:40.583 --> 13:41.832
Let's go, Brynn!

13:41.833 --> 13:43.791

I love your voice.
I think you're beautiful.

16:04.483 --> 16:05.767

You have a lot of different
elements to your voice.

16:09.643 --> 16:12.204

sing songs to showcase that

16:12.253 --> 16:13.688

16:45.456 --> 16:46.495

can feel so much.

16:50.708 --> 16:51.874
Oh, thank you.

16:51.875 --> 16:54.124
You have such a beautiful voice.

16:54.125 --> 16:55.332
How long have you been singing?

16:55.333 --> 16:57.332
Since I was, like, in the crib.

16:57.357 --> 16:58.553
- Instead of waking up crying,
- Really?

16:58.577 --> 17:00.004
- I would wake up singing.
- Yes.

17:00.029 --> 17:01.041
- That's what my parents would always say.
- Aww.

17:01.042 --> 17:03.874
- I can tell.
- It's kind of exciting that Blake turned

17:03.875 --> 17:07.040
'cause, you know, he's Blake,
and he's got dimples.

17:07.041 --> 17:08.207
Dimples?

17:08.208 --> 17:09.540
But if Kelly didn't get you,

17:09.541 --> 17:11.374
there's something wrong with the world.

17:11.375 --> 17:13.540
Have you seen this show before?
Have you watched "The Voice"?

17:13.541 --> 17:15.374
I've been watching the show
since I was really little.

17:15.375 --> 17:17.040
While she was listening to my music.

17:17.041 --> 17:19.582
I was, yeah. At the same time.

17:19.583 --> 17:20.915
Then you know

17:20.916 --> 17:24.707
that it is Adam's mission

17:24.708 --> 17:26.540
to try to derail me

17:26.541 --> 17:28.332

for an artist.

17:28.333 --> 17:32.999

then you know that

17:42.750 --> 17:48.249

with young females on this show

17:48.250 --> 17:50.082
than everyone else combined.

17:50.083 --> 17:51.749
And Kelly has

17:51.750 --> 17:54.082
absolutely no experience
on this show whatsoever.

17:54.083 --> 17:55.332
Ooh.

17:55.333 --> 17:57.249
I mean, I mean, I mean, son.

17:57.250 --> 17:58.916
I had enough experience

17:58.917 --> 18:02.374
that he had me mentor his team
on the second season!

18:02.375 --> 18:04.124
Oh!

18:04.125 --> 18:05.791
Whoo!

18:05.792 --> 18:08.582

He had to phone a friend.

18:11.083 --> 18:12.624
She's also the most successful person

18:12.625 --> 18:15.291
- ever to come off of a show like this.
- That's true.

18:15.292 --> 18:16.916

18:41.125 --> 18:44.082
It's the 14th season.
I'm wearing my Season 14 jersey.

18:44.083 --> 18:45.332
- Can't help you now.
- I'm sorry!

18:45.333 --> 18:46.916
I can't help you now.

18:46.917 --> 18:48.291

she's an actual fan.

19:46.458 --> 19:49.124
Oh, here we go. Here we go. Here we go.

19:49.125 --> 19:52.541
...and here I am now
on Season 14 of "The Voice."

19:57.375 --> 19:59.207
I'm Rayshun LaMarr, I'm 33 years old,

19:59.208 --> 20:01.374
and I'm from Fort Washington, Maryland.

20:01.375 --> 20:04.207
I love to sing, and I love to dance.

20:04.208 --> 20:06.541
I'm part of a band
called Sound Connection.

20:06.542 --> 20:09.207
We do corporate events. We do weddings.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.082
We travel around the world.

20:11.083 --> 20:13.582
Every time I step on stage
with them, I light up.

20:13.583 --> 20:15.916
Right as things started
to really pick up

20:15.917 --> 20:18.832
for me and the band...

20:18.833 --> 20:21.666
something went totally wrong.

20:21.667 --> 20:24.249
One day, I just felt
really, really weak.

20:24.250 --> 20:26.916
I was really cold, but I was
sweating at the same time.

20:26.917 --> 20:29.249
And I said,
"I need to go to the hospital."

20:29.250 --> 20:32.374
I get there, and I blacked out.

20:32.375 --> 20:33.916
And I wake back up,

20:33.917 --> 20:36.499
and I see my mom,
at, like, the foot of the bed.

20:36.500 --> 20:39.874
And I overheard the doctors
telling my mom, you know,

20:39.875 --> 20:41.499
"You got to call your immediate family

20:41.500 --> 20:43.707
'cause we don't know
if he's gonna make it."

20:47.468 --> 20:53.874
For a mother to see their child
laying in the hospital

20:53.875 --> 20:57.291
hooked up to all these machines,

20:57.292 --> 21:00.791
that was really a hard time for us.

21:00.792 --> 21:03.291
I was diagnosed with lymphoma cancer.

21:03.292 --> 21:05.124
I went through blood transfusions.

21:05.125 --> 21:08.749
I had platelet transfusions
and chemotherapy.

21:08.750 --> 21:13.124
I lost my voice.
I lost my hearing in one ear.

21:13.125 --> 21:16.082
During that time,
all I had really was...

21:16.083 --> 21:18.249
my faith and my music.

21:18.250 --> 21:21.457
For me to go from being half-dead

21:21.458 --> 21:23.249
to being on "The Voice,"

21:23.250 --> 21:25.833
I've never felt more alive than that.

21:27.625 --> 21:29.124
How's your health right now?
How do you feel?

21:29.125 --> 21:30.624
Oh, man. I am cancer-free!

21:30.625 --> 21:32.332
- I'm so glad you're all right.
- Thank you.

21:32.333 --> 21:34.791
What was the world of music
in your life at that point?

21:34.792 --> 21:37.791
It was a healer. It energized me.

21:37.792 --> 21:40.124
It... It was... It was my passion.

21:40.125 --> 21:44.499
I regained my hearing about 10
months into my chemo treatment.

21:44.500 --> 21:46.222
Gradually, my voice
started to come back.

21:47.723 --> 21:50.957
When I sing now, I feel like
people could actually feel me

21:50.958 --> 21:53.675
versus just hearing me.

21:53.833 --> 21:56.666
I'll be singing "Don't
Stop Believin'" by Journey.

21:56.667 --> 21:58.291
When I was in intensive care,

21:58.292 --> 22:00.499
I played this song over and over again.

22:00.500 --> 22:03.166
This song is the epitome of my life.

22:03.167 --> 22:05.332
Keep believing in yourself.

22:05.333 --> 22:09.082
Keep believing in great things,
and things will happen.

"Man, I can't believe
that was a white dude."

24:04.125 --> 24:06.541
That is true. That is true.

24:06.542 --> 24:08.680
This might be the first time
in the history of the show, I'm like,

24:08.728 --> 24:10.767
- "It's a black dude. I can't believe it."
- Yes.

24:10.792 --> 24:12.541
- That has never happened before.
- Yeah, that is true.

24:12.542 --> 24:15.124
It's, like, unprecedented
that that happened.

24:15.125 --> 24:16.416
Wow. What?!

24:16.417 --> 24:18.332
You were singing with so much joy.

24:18.333 --> 24:20.942
You just had so much powerful
pleasure while he...

24:20.966 --> 24:22.082
- Right?
- Yes.

24:22.083 --> 24:24.249
- Like, you were so happy to be singing.
- Seeing it... Seeing it was different.

24:24.250 --> 24:26.457
Can we find out what your name is?

24:26.458 --> 24:27.999
I'm Rayshun LaMarr.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.124
I'm 33, and I'm from
Fort Washington, Maryland.

24:30.125 --> 24:31.957
Wow.

24:31.958 --> 24:33.749
He looks like he's
still singing the song.

24:33.750 --> 24:35.250
I know! He's so happy!

24:36.458 --> 24:37.916
♪ Ahh ♪

24:37.917 --> 24:40.082
He's so happy. It's so great. I love it.

24:40.083 --> 24:42.416
I already see the hashtags.
Like #RayshunNation.

24:42.417 --> 24:44.082
This is gonna be
the greatest thing ever.

24:44.083 --> 24:45.832
You got this.

24:45.833 --> 24:48.916
This sheer bliss that you sing
with is really infectious.

24:48.917 --> 24:52.082
You're also an interesting dude
because I see both of us in you.

24:52.083 --> 24:53.916
Actually, I do, too, man.

24:53.917 --> 24:55.666
Maybe we should co-coach. I don't know.

24:55.667 --> 24:56.957
Yeah, could we both have you?

24:56.958 --> 24:58.791
I would love that!

25:00.333 --> 25:01.957
It is awesome when you turn around,

25:01.958 --> 25:04.874
and you see someone living
what they're singing.

25:04.875 --> 25:07.541
Thank you. This song
means so much because...

25:07.542 --> 25:09.167
Ahh!

25:10.708 --> 25:12.999
Five years ago, I almost died, man.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.291
- I had cancer.
- Oh, my God.

25:15.292 --> 25:16.874
Oh, thank you, Jesus.

25:16.875 --> 25:19.874
While in ICU, I used to play that song,

25:19.875 --> 25:22.374
and it used to, like...

25:22.375 --> 25:23.874
I'm gonna cry. Oh, no.

25:23.875 --> 25:25.624
It used to give me
so much hope and energy.

25:25.625 --> 25:28.041
- And, like, I just said...
- Wow.

25:31.458 --> 25:33.957
Wow. That's amazing.

25:33.958 --> 25:36.541
I'm so mad I didn't turn around.
I love you.

25:37.958 --> 25:40.959
Besides making it onto "The Voice," man,
congratulations

25:40.984 --> 25:42.332
- on making it through cancer.
- Yeah.

25:42.333 --> 25:45.749
Thank you, man.

25:45.750 --> 25:48.999
You have earned this moment.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.832
You chose the song that helped you
through what you went through...

25:51.833 --> 25:54.166
That's what makes you special.

25:54.167 --> 25:55.696
- Very true.
- You say "Don't Stop Believin'"?

25:55.721 --> 25:57.512
I'm gonna start believing right
now that I'm just your coach.

25:57.537 --> 25:58.786
- Nice.
- And that's what's happening.

25:58.811 --> 26:00.212
- I like that.
- Oh, that was good.

26:00.237 --> 26:02.749
- Nice play.
- That was good. That was good.

26:02.750 --> 26:06.207
Okay, okay. All right.

26:06.208 --> 26:08.082
- Um...
- Come on, Alicia.

26:08.083 --> 26:10.249
As your coach, it is important
not only to have someone

26:10.250 --> 26:11.582
that matches the energy...

26:13.250 --> 26:17.082
...but also somebody who will be
critical when it's necessary

26:17.083 --> 26:18.541
because there were certain things

26:18.542 --> 26:20.207
that could have been
a little bit better.

26:20.208 --> 26:21.749
- Yeah, I agree.
- That's what I'm about,

26:21.750 --> 26:24.124
helping somebody really tap into
that next thing

26:24.125 --> 26:26.291
that's gonna make them even better.

26:26.292 --> 26:28.124
Let's just do it right now.

26:28.125 --> 26:30.457
- Let's just...
- He wouldn't be able to go right now

26:30.458 --> 26:32.124
if I hadn't turned around, as well.

26:32.125 --> 26:34.624
Sadly for me, there's you.

26:34.625 --> 26:37.957
That is Alicia Keys, man!

26:37.958 --> 26:41.124
I mean, are you kidding me?!

26:41.125 --> 26:43.582
- Ahh!
- I believe this is the place

26:43.583 --> 26:45.624
that you've been meant
to come to right now.

26:45.625 --> 26:47.957
Your story is very, very inspiring.

26:47.958 --> 26:51.791
And we need somebody who will
not let anything stop them.

26:51.792 --> 26:53.624
You are the living embodiment of that,

26:53.625 --> 26:57.416
and it makes me
all the more just dedicated

26:57.417 --> 27:00.582
to helping your story come to life.

27:00.583 --> 27:03.666
Adam, you just lost from that.
I'm just gonna say.

27:03.667 --> 27:06.166
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- I want to be on her team.

27:06.167 --> 27:09.249
- I'm, like, I could be great with Alicia.
- Young Kelly, you're new.

27:09.250 --> 27:12.999
So is he, and I'd pick her
after that. I'm just saying.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.332
He's a great coach,
but that was really good.

27:15.333 --> 27:16.832
Yes, Kelly!

27:19.792 --> 27:24.791
I'm ready for my second
consecutive win... with you.

27:24.792 --> 27:28.166
- Oh! Whoa!
- That's what I'm ready for.

27:28.167 --> 27:30.416
Technically not consecutive, but we
don't need to get into the minutia.

27:30.417 --> 27:32.166
Oh, well, whatever.
You know what I mean.

27:32.167 --> 27:34.999
Oh, she got up!

27:44.292 --> 27:45.499
- Super proud of you.
- Thank you.

27:45.500 --> 27:47.166
This is a beautiful moment.

27:47.167 --> 27:48.874
I'm really excited for you.

27:48.875 --> 27:51.041
- All right.
- Sit down.

27:52.875 --> 27:54.457
Don't tell me what to do.

27:54.458 --> 27:55.874
- I don't know...
- Look at how she looks!

28:01.208 --> 28:04.207
I know I lost already, but let
me tell you about me, Rayshun.

28:04.208 --> 28:06.541
- Let me tell you about me.
- Oh, all right.

28:06.542 --> 28:09.374
- Go ahead.
- There is probably a 0.1,

28:09.375 --> 28:12.041
maybe even if you could
calculate a lesser number...

28:12.042 --> 28:14.707
That's probably where I stand
right now, okay?

28:14.708 --> 28:18.207
But I'm the guy who's never gonna stop

28:18.208 --> 28:22.207
to make sure that you get as far
as humanly possible on this show.

28:22.208 --> 28:23.541
I'm the guy.

28:26.250 --> 28:27.667
Whoo!

28:29.083 --> 28:30.874
All right, Rayshun. Who you gonna pick?

28:30.875 --> 28:32.916
Ahh!

28:32.917 --> 28:35.749
Just come right here. Come right here.

28:35.750 --> 28:37.082
Don't worry about him.

28:37.083 --> 28:38.666
Please.

28:44.167 --> 28:47.582
Oh, I love you both. I really do! Ahh!

28:51.750 --> 28:54.208
We. We.

28:55.250 --> 28:56.582
I pick Adam!

29:01.917 --> 29:03.249
What?!

29:03.250 --> 29:05.249
Rayshun... it's always fun

29:05.250 --> 29:07.916
when you hear someone sing
with so much passion and fire,

29:07.917 --> 29:11.791
and beating out Alicia Keys
for somebody is brutal.

29:11.792 --> 29:14.749
I was afraid, but, hey, worked it out.

29:14.750 --> 29:17.916
I knew he shouldn't
have got the last word!

29:17.917 --> 29:20.541
I was a little sad
about the Rayshun moment.

29:20.542 --> 29:22.291
I felt like I had that one.

29:22.292 --> 29:24.582
Perhaps that should show me you don't...

29:24.583 --> 29:26.707
you know, it's not over till it's over.

29:28.812 --> 29:29.930
I am shocked that you chose me.

29:29.954 --> 29:31.954
- I can't believe it.
- You spoke right here.

29:31.958 --> 29:33.624
If you're a coach,
I want you to tell me how...

29:33.625 --> 29:36.874
how I can be better,
and I think that did it for me.

29:36.875 --> 29:38.916
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, brother.

29:38.917 --> 29:40.957
I appreciate you, man.
Thank you so much!

Growing up in a Pentecostal
household, you went to church.

30:23.833 --> 30:25.999
You went to school. You went to church.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.166
You went to choir rehearsal,

Literally school, church, school, church.

My name is Kyla Jade, I'm 33 years old,

30:33.333 --> 30:35.374

in Nashville, Tennessee.

♪ Ooh ♪

30:37.208 --> 30:41.332
I worked most of my career
as background or session singer.

30:41.333 --> 30:43.791
I have sang for Carrie Underwood.

30:43.792 --> 30:45.957
Wynonna Judd was my very first tour.

30:45.958 --> 30:47.457
It was a good little ride.

30:47.458 --> 30:49.624
But around the time I turned 30,

30:49.625 --> 30:52.874
my mom was having a series of seizures.

30:52.875 --> 30:56.124
My mother is my rock.

30:56.125 --> 30:58.957
So, music had to be
put on the back burner.

30:58.958 --> 31:00.874
Kyla stayed with me,
doing all of the things

31:00.875 --> 31:02.707
that I could not do for myself.

31:02.708 --> 31:04.707
- I love you, Mommy.
- I love you.

31:04.708 --> 31:05.874
Okay.

31:05.875 --> 31:07.707

31:07.708 --> 31:09.707
I got a text message from
a friend of mine who was like,

31:09.708 --> 31:11.499
"Can you audition for Jennifer Hudson?"

31:11.500 --> 31:13.666
Sure, I will.

31:13.667 --> 31:15.707
I have literally been with her
for three years.

31:15.777 --> 31:19.991
We have done Australia, Europe,
and then...

31:20.912 --> 31:23.082
we did Season 12 finale of "The Voice."

31:23.083 --> 31:24.499
Behind Jen, you see the chairs,

31:24.500 --> 31:25.832
and you're, like, "This is really cool."

31:25.833 --> 31:27.207
What song are you singing for us?

31:27.208 --> 31:29.332
I'm doing "See Saw" by Aretha Franklin.

31:29.333 --> 31:31.666
Something tells me
you're gonna cover it just fine.

31:31.667 --> 31:33.999
- I hope so.
- Listen, you got a lot of support here.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.041
- Absolutely.
- But I got one more here for you.

31:36.042 --> 31:39.374
Kyla, congratulations
on your blind audition.

31:39.375 --> 31:42.166
I am so happy to see you
pursuing your dreams

31:42.167 --> 31:44.249
and letting the world
hear your beautiful gift.

31:44.250 --> 31:46.207
And I will be cheering you on, girl.

31:46.208 --> 31:47.749
You know I am.

31:47.750 --> 31:49.041
Love you. Good luck.

31:49.042 --> 31:50.875
I love you.

31:53.250 --> 31:56.624
I would be honored to work
with any of these coaches.

31:56.625 --> 31:58.249
I think Kelly

31:58.250 --> 32:00.957
will connect immediately
to the song that I'm singing

32:00.958 --> 32:03.624
because she herself auditioned
with an Aretha Franklin song

32:03.625 --> 32:05.916
on the show that she did.

32:05.917 --> 32:07.292
I'm gonna get it.

32:08.750 --> 32:10.249
Whoop!

32:10.250 --> 32:12.416
I am very comfortable in the background,

32:12.417 --> 32:17.249
and so for me to not be there
gives me complete anxiety,

32:17.250 --> 32:20.708
but this is my time

34:12.500 --> 34:13.966
You don't even know her.

34:13.989 --> 34:15.498

- All right.
- Nashville!

34:22.750 --> 34:25.998
I think you're amazing.
That was... real good.

34:26.000 --> 34:27.666
Those notes that you were hitting,

34:27.667 --> 34:31.041
the flawless, easy way
that you were doing it,

34:31.042 --> 34:32.916
it's so spectacular.

34:32.917 --> 34:34.248
- Thank you so much.
- I appreciate it.

34:34.250 --> 34:36.916
I'm so happy for you. Yes!

34:36.917 --> 34:38.331
Thank you.

have to say for yourself...

34:42.625 --> 34:44.456
- Well, no.
- ...for... for cutting me out of this.

34:44.458 --> 34:47.081
- No, the reason why I have...
- No, duh, duh. Duh, duh, duh.

34:48.458 --> 34:50.623
First of all, I love that song.

34:50.625 --> 34:53.123
Aretha Franklin is one of the
reasons that made me be a signer.

34:53.125 --> 34:54.956
I love your hair. I love your look.

34:54.958 --> 34:56.623
- Yes.
- I love everything about you.

34:56.625 --> 35:00.082
I think every part of it
is just sassy and confident

35:00.083 --> 35:02.082
and boss and just so good.

35:02.083 --> 35:04.457
And I love those kinda songs.

35:04.458 --> 35:07.582
I know Blake has won "a lot on
the show," and I'm the rookie,

35:07.583 --> 35:11.957
but I'm just saying,
I have won a competition, so...

35:13.875 --> 35:17.249
So, now he's gonna be charming,

35:17.250 --> 35:20.624
but I'm telling you, I'm the
best pick out of this situation.

35:20.625 --> 35:22.374
I'm just gonna say.

35:25.333 --> 35:26.499
Go ahead.

35:28.417 --> 35:30.791
- Whew!
- Oh, my God.

35:30.792 --> 35:32.166
- Hi, Kyla.
- Hello.

35:32.167 --> 35:36.582
I want you... on my team so bad.

35:36.583 --> 35:38.499
By the way, what are you doing
in Nashville?

35:38.500 --> 35:40.749
I've been singing
professionally background.

35:40.750 --> 35:42.332
Who you singing with?
What are you doing?

35:42.333 --> 35:44.624
I actually sing background
for Jennifer Hudson.

35:44.625 --> 35:46.999
- Oh.
- No kidding.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.666
I was on this stage
doo-wopping behind her.

35:49.667 --> 35:52.156
Yes!

35:52.625 --> 35:55.666
Hopefully, she said something
good about me.

35:55.667 --> 35:57.499
Uh, damn it. What do I say?

35:57.500 --> 35:58.666
No, wait. I do have something to say.

35:58.667 --> 36:00.124
My girls that sing with me,

36:00.125 --> 36:02.166
I have them step out
and do their own stuff.

36:02.167 --> 36:04.332
- I think that's spectacular...
- Thank you.

36:04.333 --> 36:05.957
...that you're stepping out.
I don't know if anybody saw

36:05.958 --> 36:08.332
the "20 Feet from Stardom,"
but these... Oh, my God.

36:08.333 --> 36:10.291
But these... I'm just saying,
it's a beautiful thing

36:10.292 --> 36:11.791
- because...
- That's true.

36:11.792 --> 36:15.457
...a lot of times,
you don't get to hear...

36:15.458 --> 36:18.832
A lot of times, you don't get
to hear the people in the back.

36:22.167 --> 36:23.833
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry.
Hurry, hurry.

36:28.792 --> 36:31.499
Pretend like
I didn't get rudely interrupted.

36:31.500 --> 36:32.743
No, you said you didn't know

36:32.768 --> 36:33.957
what to say. I was...

36:33.958 --> 36:35.166
Kids!

36:35.167 --> 36:37.541
The first time I ever won this show

36:37.542 --> 36:42.291
was with Alicia Keys'
back-up singer, Jermaine Paul.

36:42.292 --> 36:43.666
That is true.

36:43.667 --> 36:45.791
- Oh, Lord.
- Kyla, let's do this thing.

36:45.792 --> 36:48.166
Let's win the show.
Let's win "The Voice."

36:48.167 --> 36:50.999
Come on, Kyla!

36:51.000 --> 36:52.707
All right, Kyla.

36:52.708 --> 36:54.499
Who do you pick as your coach?

36:54.500 --> 36:57.249
Kyla! Come on!

37:01.333 --> 37:03.374
I am kindred with Kelly

37:03.375 --> 37:06.582
because we share Aretha Franklin.

37:06.583 --> 37:08.249
Yes.

37:08.250 --> 37:10.916
But the first person to ever
give me an opportunity

37:10.917 --> 37:13.582
was Wynonna Judd,

37:27.375 --> 37:29.041
- You're incredible.
- Thank you.

37:29.042 --> 37:30.874
I promise you, Kyla.
You're not gonna regret this.

37:30.875 --> 37:33.916
- I love Wynonna!
- I love you, too.

37:33.917 --> 37:36.916
Kyla should be on my team.
Like, I'm so confused.

37:36.917 --> 37:38.791
That just happened!

37:38.792 --> 37:40.457
I didn't honestly think
I was gonna fight Blake

37:40.458 --> 37:44.457
that hard for Kyla,
but I-I was real wrong.

37:45.750 --> 37:47.957

- No, I need it.

- Wynonna. Wynonna!

38:04.958 --> 38:06.916
It was Wynonna!

38:06.917 --> 38:08.249
That has nothing to do
with Blake Shelton.

38:08.250 --> 38:09.866

38:30.250 --> 38:32.832
I'm 25 years old,

38:32.833 --> 38:36.332
I love the water.

38:36.333 --> 38:39.916
It definitely recharges me
just going from day-to-day life.

38:45.833 --> 38:48.166
During the week, I'm a pool technician.

38:48.167 --> 38:51.750
I service anywhere
from 12 to 15 pools per day.

38:53.042 --> 38:55.124
I'll get my machine ready,
I'll vacuum the pool,

38:55.125 --> 38:56.666
check the chemicals.

38:56.667 --> 38:58.874
But I know that
there's more for my life.

39:00.500 --> 39:02.374
As a kid, I loved to sing,

39:02.375 --> 39:05.124
especially in my grandparents' church.

39:05.125 --> 39:06.624
I started playing guitar.

39:06.625 --> 39:09.457
I knew that music was really starting

39:09.458 --> 39:11.292
to become a part of my life.

39:12.667 --> 39:14.874
I attended a leadership college

39:14.875 --> 39:17.707
because I knew that taking
leadership courses

39:17.708 --> 39:21.708
was gonna translate
into bigger things for my life.

39:23.708 --> 39:27.041
And so I started my first
ministry called Cliffside 360.

39:27.042 --> 39:29.707
It started with just me and my guitar,

39:29.708 --> 39:34.874
and it has grown in 2 years
to 100 people faithfully coming,

39:34.875 --> 39:36.916
young and old, from all across the city,

39:36.917 --> 39:38.582
come to worship God,

39:38.583 --> 39:41.833
and what better spot
than on top of a mountain?

39:44.250 --> 39:46.416
Cliffside has done so much in my life,

39:46.417 --> 39:48.832

39:51.250 --> 39:52.916
I can't be cleaning pools forever.

39:52.917 --> 39:55.582
I know my goal is to be
a Christian artist,

39:55.583 --> 39:59.082
and being on this platform
is pushing me in that direction.

39:59.083 --> 40:02.916
I have never had an opportunity
like this in my life.

Aww, Texas! Aww.

41:40.333 --> 41:42.874
The one thing that made me
think about pushing the button

41:42.875 --> 41:44.499
was you have a very round tone.

41:44.500 --> 41:46.207
It would just get pitchy
in certain places,

41:46.208 --> 41:48.207
and I just felt the nerves a little bit.

41:48.208 --> 41:50.166
There's a lot going through your mind

41:50.167 --> 41:51.832
and a lot happening up there,

41:51.833 --> 41:53.332
and it doesn't take much
a lot of the times

41:53.333 --> 41:55.041

as tightly as it could be.

42:16.042 --> 42:17.999
Blaise really had
a very beautiful voice.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.291
But his nerves got the better of him.

42:20.292 --> 42:21.582

My name is Kelsea Johnson.

43:02.982 --> 43:05.773
I'm 21 years old,
and I'm from Newark, Delaware.

43:05.774 --> 43:09.416
I've always sang, and when I was 6,

43:09.417 --> 43:13.124
I stood on the chair
at my birthday party,

43:13.125 --> 43:15.957
and I told everybody to be quiet
'cause I'm gonna sing a song.

43:15.958 --> 43:17.791
And all my family's just rooting for me.

43:17.792 --> 43:19.124
Like, yay, yay.

43:19.125 --> 43:21.582
They just supported me from day one.

43:21.583 --> 43:26.041
My grandfather, Papa, brought
the music into our family.

43:26.042 --> 43:27.916
He was part of a mariachi band.

43:27.917 --> 43:32.249
His love for music, I know that
it just passed down into me.

43:32.250 --> 43:37.207
In October 2015, Papa was
diagnosed with liver cancer.

43:37.208 --> 43:38.874
It was a lot.

43:42.292 --> 43:45.749
Papa wanted me to pursue
my singing career.

43:45.750 --> 43:49.832
And I told him I made it
to the blind auditions.

43:49.833 --> 43:52.749
That's when he was doing
really, really bad.

43:52.750 --> 43:55.999
I started to second-guess
if I even wanted to come

43:56.000 --> 43:59.832
because we didn't know
what tomorrow held.

43:59.833 --> 44:02.624
Even in the hospital, he kept saying,

44:02.625 --> 44:05.416
"Don't change your plans. Just go."

44:05.417 --> 44:08.999
He knows that I was gonna do
this, and now he can't see it.

44:09.000 --> 44:11.292
I miss him so much.

44:12.667 --> 44:15.291
I know that all of his support
has led up to this,

44:15.292 --> 44:18.957
and I can finally show him
and the rest of my family

44:18.958 --> 44:20.957

Welcome to "The Voice."

46:27.837 --> 46:29.707
My ass needs a kicking
for not turning around.

46:29.708 --> 46:31.332
- That was really good.
- So good.

46:31.333 --> 46:32.666
What is your name? Where you from?

46:32.667 --> 46:34.166
My name is Kelsea Johnson.

46:34.167 --> 46:36.291
I'm 21 years old,
and I'm from Newark, Delaware.

46:36.292 --> 46:40.499
I'm so mad right now because...
Alicia Keys turned around.

46:41.750 --> 46:43.499
I know! I should have blocked her.

46:43.500 --> 46:44.916
That was a very wasted opportunity.

46:44.917 --> 46:46.499
You should have done that.

46:46.500 --> 46:49.999
That's not right.
Conspiring against me is wrong.

46:50.000 --> 46:53.624
Kelsea, you are absolutely stunning

46:53.625 --> 46:56.791
from the way that you sing
to the way that you look.

46:56.792 --> 46:58.082
- We can do this.
- Thank you.

46:58.083 --> 47:00.124
I don't have any doubts in my mind.

47:00.125 --> 47:01.832
Thank you.

47:03.667 --> 47:05.499
Hands down, you could make
a record right now

47:05.500 --> 47:06.983
and release it and have a career.

47:07.008 --> 47:10.249
As your coach, I would love
to focus on songs

47:10.250 --> 47:12.166
that really get you further
in this competition,

47:12.167 --> 47:13.666
to have that air time,

47:13.667 --> 47:15.457
to reach as many people
as you possibly...

47:15.458 --> 47:17.666
'Cause I didn't hear
any head voice from you yet.

47:17.667 --> 47:20.332
I didn't hear any intimacy yet,
which I think you have.

47:20.333 --> 47:21.874
- Yeah.
- That is gonna be the important thing

47:21.875 --> 47:23.291
just 'cause I've been you

47:23.292 --> 47:25.041
and I've had to navigate
through a competition.

47:25.042 --> 47:28.374
How do you stay on,
but not give it all away

47:28.375 --> 47:30.124
so when you make that finale,

47:30.125 --> 47:32.999
you're like, "Just kidding.
I have this, too"?

47:33.000 --> 47:34.624
- Yeah.
- Well, of the three of us,

47:34.625 --> 47:37.291
there's one person
who's done that 13 times.

47:37.292 --> 47:40.750
- I'm literally the most experienced.
- Well, hold on,

47:40.775 --> 47:42.207
- I'd like to get a word or two in
- Uh, that is a fact.

47:42.208 --> 47:44.457
for one second 'cause y'all are like...

47:44.458 --> 47:46.166
Alicia Keys.

47:46.167 --> 47:48.291
You have a gift, and you have a reason

47:48.292 --> 47:49.999
why you were given that gift.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.874
And, um, I have won the show.
I plan to win it again.

47:52.899 --> 47:54.293
I'm a monster. I'm a beast.

47:54.317 --> 47:55.871
- I don't stop.
- I agree.

47:55.896 --> 47:58.999
Right now, I'm in the studio with
Chris Blue planning his plan.

47:59.000 --> 48:00.832
- I am dedicated to what happens.
- Wow.

48:00.833 --> 48:03.166
I believe we could
win "The Voice" together.

48:03.167 --> 48:05.332
Thanks.

48:05.333 --> 48:08.499
Okay, Kelsea. Who do you pick
as your coach? Come on.

48:15.250 --> 48:18.082
Thank you guys so much
for your kind words.

48:26.083 --> 48:28.082
- I pick Alicia.
- Come on, baby!

48:28.083 --> 48:29.416
Of course.

48:29.417 --> 48:30.916
- Of course!
- Come on, Kelsea!

48:30.917 --> 48:33.166
I can't believe this!

48:33.167 --> 48:34.749
Oh, my gosh!

48:34.750 --> 48:36.208
Kelsea is a killer.

48:36.233 --> 48:40.082
Not only does she have a super
powerful, beautiful range,

48:40.083 --> 48:41.582
but she's beautiful.

48:41.583 --> 48:43.249
She's like the total package, you know?

48:43.250 --> 48:46.916
- Yay, Kelsea!
- See you later.

48:46.917 --> 48:49.457
My life is changed forever.

48:49.458 --> 48:51.082
I had to go with Alicia, though,

48:51.083 --> 48:53.124
'cause the fact that she
still works with Chris Blue,

48:53.125 --> 48:55.791
and I know that she's dedicated
to this. I could just feel it.

48:55.792 --> 48:57.291
The last word.

48:57.292 --> 48:59.624
I tried to get the last word.
They keep talking.

48:59.625 --> 49:02.624
Right now, to me, Kelsea is
the biggest threat on this show

49:02.625 --> 49:04.457
'cause she's not on my team.

49:04.458 --> 49:06.124
I should have blocked her.

49:06.125 --> 49:08.957
But I'm not after you, Kelly.
I'm after him.

We're in L.A.
I'm on my way to meet Drew Cole,

49:27.625 --> 49:30.416
who works as a bartender inside
a movie theater right now,

49:30.417 --> 49:33.666
but he's hoping that "The Voice"
will be the big break he needs.

49:37.917 --> 49:41.166
So, Drew, what's it like to
work at a bar inside a movie theater?

49:41.167 --> 49:42.999
I really enjoy it.
When I'm not behind the bar,

49:43.000 --> 49:44.499
it's music constantly.

49:44.500 --> 49:46.457
- And where are you from?
- Richfield, Connecticut.

49:46.458 --> 49:48.082
What brought you to L.A.?

49:48.083 --> 49:50.499
I had a-a viral video
on YouTube a few years ago.

49:50.500 --> 49:52.666
I was serenading my friend's dog.

49:59.575 --> 50:00.874
You know, I was...
I was strumming the guitar,

50:00.875 --> 50:03.832
and then I would stop, and then
she kind of shut her mouth.

50:07.208 --> 50:08.641
How many millions of views did that get?

50:08.666 --> 50:10.707
I think it's like
up to like 14 million now.

50:10.708 --> 50:12.374
I had so many people reaching out to me,

50:12.375 --> 50:14.791
one of which was a music
producer here in Los Angeles.

50:14.792 --> 50:17.332
He said, "Through this dog video,
I found your other content.

50:17.333 --> 50:20.124
I think you're great. I'd love to
have you out to write some songs."

50:20.125 --> 50:22.291
That ultimately inspired me
to move out here full-time.

50:22.292 --> 50:23.591
I'm sure you're a great bartender,

50:23.615 --> 50:24.666
but we certainly would like to see you

50:24.667 --> 50:25.980
- doing music full-time and...
- Yeah, me too.

50:26.004 --> 50:27.374
- getting paid for it, so...
- Me too, man.

50:27.399 --> 50:28.472
I hope this opportunity goes well

50:28.497 --> 50:30.166
- for you on the blind auditions.
- Yeah, man. Thank you, man.

50:30.167 --> 50:32.291
I took a big risk moving out here

50:32.292 --> 50:34.874
'cause everyone is so good.

50:34.875 --> 50:36.874
I've been here in L.A.
for three years now.

50:36.875 --> 50:39.291
You know, I play bars and small venues.

50:39.292 --> 50:40.666
I take every gig I can get,

50:40.667 --> 50:42.416
but I haven't had that break yet.

50:42.417 --> 50:45.625
This opportunity
that I have here is a big one.

50:47.208 --> 50:50.374
Coming to the "Voice" stage
is next-level

50:50.375 --> 50:52.249
from what I've done in the past.

50:52.250 --> 50:53.874
Growing up listening to Maroon 5,

50:53.875 --> 50:55.416
I'm right in that rock-pop vein.

50:55.417 --> 50:58.416
So, I would love to work
with Adam Levine,

50:58.417 --> 51:00.707
but Blake could really
bring me a new perspective

51:00.708 --> 51:01.986
with country music.

51:02.011 --> 51:04.010
I did not move to Los Angeles
to be a bartender.

51:04.035 --> 51:05.620
I moved here to be a rock star.

51:05.645 --> 51:07.853

doesn't deter you from keeping
your eye on the prize

53:28.708 --> 53:30.874

I did a cover of that song

53:30.875 --> 53:33.041
- that was very similar to that.
- Yes, you did.

53:33.042 --> 53:35.707

it had something to do

53:35.708 --> 53:37.249
- with the cover that I did.
- Definitely.

53:37.250 --> 53:39.541
I just love that he's
complimenting you so much,

53:39.542 --> 53:41.749
and that's what's funny 'cause you're,
like, complimenting yourself.

53:41.750 --> 53:43.484
- 'Cause I do think y'all have similarities.
- No.

53:43.509 --> 53:44.916
You're, like,

53:44.917 --> 53:49.248
"You are the most amazing thing
that's ever happened!"

53:50.298 --> 53:53.249
Like... So, like, really?
You, like, think you're the voice.

53:53.250 --> 53:56.707
I-I-I only said...

53:58.708 --> 54:00.041
- Yes!
- I'm just kidding.

54:00.042 --> 54:02.249
- Yes!
- I know, I know, I know.

54:02.250 --> 54:04.207
- I know.
- Whew!

54:04.232 --> 54:06.202
- Yes.
- Your hands are so big, Blake,

54:06.226 --> 54:08.836
that when you clap, it's like two
pieces of meat slapping together.

54:09.875 --> 54:11.791
- What's your name, man?
- My name's Drew Cole.

54:11.792 --> 54:13.957
- I'm 25 years old.
- Hey, Drew.

54:13.958 --> 54:16.791
I know I'm a country artist,
but I've won this show

54:16.792 --> 54:18.791
with all kinds of different artists

54:18.792 --> 54:22.082
because I try to take
the focus off of me.

54:23.649 --> 54:26.337
And I try to make it about the person
that's standing up there.

54:26.362 --> 54:27.376
Absolutely.

54:27.401 --> 54:29.582
And the way you navigate your vocals

54:29.583 --> 54:31.957
- through that song was unbelievable.
- Thank you very much.

54:31.958 --> 54:34.457
- I do see a cowboy hat on your head.
- That's true.

54:34.458 --> 54:36.291
- It's kinda cowboy. Kinda cowboy.
- I like that.

54:36.292 --> 54:37.916
Yes, Blake, you used to have
hair just like that,

54:37.917 --> 54:39.124
- so y'all got that...
- You did.

54:39.125 --> 54:40.541
I used to have hair like that.

54:40.542 --> 54:42.457
Look... Ace Ventura
is sitting down here,

54:42.458 --> 54:45.374
and I understand
that's probably gonna be

54:45.375 --> 54:47.374
the way this ends up working out,

54:47.375 --> 54:50.124
but I'm just saying, I would
love to be your coach, dude.

54:50.125 --> 54:52.999
Thank you, Blake.
Thank you very much, man.

54:53.000 --> 54:55.751
You sing the lights out without
even really trying.

54:55.776 --> 54:57.910
- Whoa.
- Immediately, you connect.

54:57.950 --> 55:01.582
So, I see you as
not potentially just the winner,

55:01.583 --> 55:04.749
- but way far beyond this competition.
- Hey.

55:04.750 --> 55:07.291
All right.

55:07.292 --> 55:09.666
Thank you, Adam. That... That's
a mind-blowing compliment.

55:09.667 --> 55:12.249
Would you like to tell us

55:12.250 --> 55:14.749
who you might pick as your coach, Drew?

55:14.750 --> 55:17.666
I absolutely would like...
would like to tell you.

55:19.750 --> 55:23.166
- Come on, Drew!
- Drew, come on!

55:23.167 --> 55:25.166
Let's do this!

55:25.167 --> 55:27.666
Let's blaze a new path. Come on!

55:27.667 --> 55:29.457
I pick...

55:31.500 --> 55:32.832
I pick Adam.

55:36.833 --> 55:39.207
Don't let go. Don't let go.

55:39.208 --> 55:41.041
- Drew is a revelation.
- Whoo!

55:41.042 --> 55:42.832
I think that we're cut
from the same cloth.

55:42.833 --> 55:44.541
It's gonna be really kind of
cool working with that guy.

55:44.542 --> 55:46.707
We're probably gonna win.
I hope you're cool with that.

55:46.708 --> 55:48.207
Yeah, I'm stoked. I can't wait.

55:51.706 --> 55:54.832
Like, he went on and on
about how amazing he was

55:54.833 --> 55:55.952
and, like, the voice,

55:55.977 --> 55:58.291
and he was like,
"Like, you remind me of me."

55:59.875 --> 56:02.291
I was, like, "Damn!"

- Yes!
- Yeah!

58:33.458 --> 58:34.874
I'm a believer!

58:36.208 --> 58:37.499
What is your name?

58:37.500 --> 58:39.041
My name is D.R. King.

58:39.042 --> 58:41.041
Now, is that Doctor King,
or just D.R. King?

58:41.042 --> 58:43.332
- It's D.R. King.
- Okay, okay.

58:43.333 --> 58:46.332
- Not to be confused with the Reverend.
- Okay, okay.

58:46.333 --> 58:48.648
I love that you brought
your soul to that song.

58:48.672 --> 58:50.045
- Killed that.
- It was so well-executed.

58:50.069 --> 58:51.567
Your runs were sick.

58:51.592 --> 58:52.902
I think you got way more

58:52.926 --> 58:54.227
- than we just heard.
- Oh, my God.

58:54.252 --> 58:56.457
- Where did you start singing?
- I grew up singing in a church.

58:56.458 --> 58:58.166
- Yes.
- And then I went to college.

58:58.167 --> 58:59.457
Then I was a schoolteacher.

58:59.458 --> 59:01.124
- A schoolteacher?
- Yes.

59:01.149 --> 59:04.273
You know what? Come on. That is... Yeah!

59:06.500 --> 59:10.166
Schoolteachers are underpaid.
My mama's in this audience.

59:10.167 --> 59:11.874
She's retired now. She was
an amazing schoolteacher.

59:11.875 --> 59:13.249
- It's a selfless job.
- Yeah, it is.

59:13.250 --> 59:14.999
- It needs to be applauded. Yes.
- It does.

59:15.000 --> 59:18.874
So, yeah, I did that, and then
I wasn't happy doing that, so I...

59:20.833 --> 59:22.582
I love the kids. I love the kids.

59:22.583 --> 59:25.075
I really do. I really do,
but I wasn't fulfilled.

59:25.100 --> 59:27.161
Yes. I was just...
Look, that was perfect.

59:27.186 --> 59:28.416
Aah!

59:31.583 --> 59:33.832
My biggest thing is believability.

59:33.833 --> 59:36.082
You can't teach just something
that's so innate

59:36.083 --> 59:37.749
because it's your gift, and so I think

59:37.750 --> 59:39.916
that we could do something
fantastic together.

59:39.917 --> 59:42.666
Thank you.

59:42.667 --> 59:45.291
You are super special, man,
and I'm very, very glad

59:45.292 --> 59:47.916
that Kelly and Blake
turned around because

59:47.917 --> 59:51.291
there is something magical
that's gonna happen.

59:51.292 --> 59:54.541
It's really, really, really hard to
fill a room with your voice like that.

59:54.542 --> 59:55.957
That's that special quality,

59:55.958 --> 59:58.457
and I think that you're
gonna be happy with Kelly.

01:00:01.125 --> 01:00:02.813
Man, I got to tell you,

01:00:02.837 --> 01:00:06.107
- your voice is explosive.
- Mm-hmm.

01:00:06.146 --> 01:00:10.457
And I have a feeling that no matter
whose version of whatever you sing,

01:00:10.458 --> 01:00:13.249
it's going to sound like D.R. King

01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:15.874
because you just have this natural gift.

01:00:15.875 --> 01:00:18.291
Literally, I was feeling it right here,

01:00:18.292 --> 01:00:20.124
every note that you were singing.

01:00:20.125 --> 01:00:23.457
It was, like, "What in the hell
is this guy doing to me?

01:00:23.458 --> 01:00:26.166
He's going to kill me!"

01:00:26.167 --> 01:00:29.499
Dude, I'll be beside myself

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:32.249
if you pick me as your coach, dude.

01:00:32.250 --> 01:00:33.582
This would be a blast.

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:38.999
D.R.! Come on!

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.791
D.R., who do you pick as your coach?

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.666
- Who's he gonna pick?
- Blake.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.291
Um...

01:00:56.667 --> 01:00:58.082
I pick Kelly.

01:00:58.083 --> 01:00:59.999
Yes!

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.957
Whoo!

01:01:02.958 --> 01:01:04.999
- I love you.
- Oh, my God. You're so...

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.124
Soul is in
many different genres of music,

01:01:07.125 --> 01:01:09.374
and I love that he took a song
that we all know,

01:01:09.375 --> 01:01:10.707
but made it his own.

01:01:10.708 --> 01:01:12.707
Yay!

01:01:12.708 --> 01:01:14.791
And he sang the crap out of it.

01:01:14.792 --> 01:01:16.999
- Whoo!
- Nice job, D.R.!

01:01:19.375 --> 01:01:21.999
I'm so proud of you.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.166
Do you want a hug?

01:01:24.167 --> 01:01:27.166
I keep going against Blake,
and the fact that I beat him,

01:01:27.167 --> 01:01:28.874
I can't even explain how happy I am.

01:01:28.875 --> 01:01:30.207
I can't explain to you how many times

01:01:30.208 --> 01:01:31.541
I will bring it up to Blake.

01:01:31.542 --> 01:01:33.166
I should have jumped in on it

01:01:33.167 --> 01:01:35.541
- because I might have missed that.
- He's really good.

01:01:35.542 --> 01:01:37.499
<i>- Coming up...</i>
- What's your name? Where you from?

01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:39.207
- All the crap.
- He's gonna be, like,

01:01:39.208 --> 01:01:41.166
"She knows nothin' about country music."

01:01:41.167 --> 01:01:43.207
"Why you want
to let her experiment on you?"

01:01:43.208 --> 01:01:45.499
- Rough crowd.
- I will call Bonnie Raitt.

01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:47.207
Anyone you want me to call, I'm calling.

01:01:47.208 --> 01:01:48.541
I'm just saying!

01:01:48.542 --> 01:01:49.749
I'm saying you look like an idiot.

01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:51.917
<i>And later...</i>

01:01:52.875 --> 01:01:55.916

I don't know what you're talking about.

01:01:58.542 --> 01:02:01.416
- I got screwed.
- That is so weird!

01:02:01.589 --> 01:02:03.750

01:02:59.125 --> 01:03:01.707
Wow. Uh, my mom had me
when she was 18 years old.

01:03:01.708 --> 01:03:03.457
My biological father, I've never met.

01:03:03.458 --> 01:03:06.374
Music tended to be one of those ways

01:03:06.375 --> 01:03:09.624
that I dealt with the idea that
your father didn't want you.

01:03:09.625 --> 01:03:11.582
And after I graduated college,

01:03:11.583 --> 01:03:13.916
I was trying to make music as a career.

01:03:13.917 --> 01:03:15.791
It was a lot of time away from my wife,

01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:17.582
my newborn baby at the time.

01:03:17.583 --> 01:03:20.791
And so I stepped away from music.

01:03:20.792 --> 01:03:22.791
We had two biological daughters,

01:03:22.792 --> 01:03:24.332
but my wife and I talked about adoption

01:03:24.333 --> 01:03:26.124
when we first got married.

01:03:26.125 --> 01:03:28.624
For me, it was an overwhelming
sense that I had to do this

01:03:28.625 --> 01:03:31.624
because I couldn't keep that
benefit from a child out there

01:03:31.625 --> 01:03:34.332
that didn't have an opportunity
to have a father.

01:03:34.333 --> 01:03:37.332
I remember we get a call,
and the lady on the phone said,

01:03:37.333 --> 01:03:39.499
"We have a little boy.

01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:43.124
He's 11 months old,
and... and here's his...

01:03:43.125 --> 01:03:45.499
his... his name was Johander."

01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:48.999
And for me, I, um...

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.832
At that moment, that was when I knew

01:03:50.833 --> 01:03:52.791
that this is exactly
what I was supposed to do.

01:03:52.792 --> 01:03:55.541

on the cheek.

01:04:09.208 --> 01:04:12.332

reminder that I'm your father,

01:04:12.333 --> 01:04:14.541

that he had given it up

01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:26.874
was to provide for our family,

01:04:26.875 --> 01:04:30.374
and so after seven years,

01:04:30.375 --> 01:04:31.874
it's time that...

01:04:31.875 --> 01:04:34.541

Tell us your name and where you're from.

01:06:56.792 --> 01:06:58.374
My name's Kaleb Lee.

01:06:58.375 --> 01:07:00.791
I'm 31 years old.
I live in Ormond Beach, Florida.

01:07:00.792 --> 01:07:03.291
I love country music.
I know he's gonna be like,

01:07:03.292 --> 01:07:05.321
"She knows nothin' about country music."

01:07:05.345 --> 01:07:06.947
- Yeah.
- "I live country music.

01:07:06.972 --> 01:07:08.291
I breathe country music."

01:07:08.292 --> 01:07:10.457
"Kaleb, why you want
to let her experiment on you."

01:07:10.458 --> 01:07:12.499
- Yeah.
- Rough crowd.

01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:14.124
Why would you want to,
now that he brings it up?

01:07:14.125 --> 01:07:15.791
That is a good point.

01:07:15.792 --> 01:07:18.041
I know enough about country music.

01:07:18.042 --> 01:07:19.817
I would be a really
good coach for you, I feel like.

01:07:19.841 --> 01:07:20.808
I agree.

01:07:20.833 --> 01:07:22.082
- Hi, Kaleb.
- Hi, Blake.

01:07:22.083 --> 01:07:23.374
"As the mayor of Country Town..."

01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:26.832
"Population... one."

01:07:28.708 --> 01:07:31.707
And I got to say,
your voice and your style

01:07:31.708 --> 01:07:35.416
kind of reminds me of the Texas
red-dirt-type country music.

01:07:35.417 --> 01:07:38.749
That's so weird,
'cause I'm Texan, Kaleb.

01:07:40.089 --> 01:07:42.749
I'm just saying. Okay, keep going.

01:07:42.750 --> 01:07:44.311
I had it right here,

01:07:44.335 --> 01:07:45.326
- and then you interrupted...
- But you said "Texas."

01:07:45.351 --> 01:07:47.416
- ...and now it's gone.
- Yes, good. Good work, Kelly.

01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:51.416
Our plan is working.

01:07:51.417 --> 01:07:53.332
Will you please go make us
a drink or something

01:07:53.333 --> 01:07:55.582
with that shirt on and get out
of here for a second?

01:07:55.583 --> 01:07:57.749
My God, please. Make me a margarita

01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:59.249
or a piña colada or something, man.

01:07:59.250 --> 01:08:01.082
- You don't have your name tag on.
- Oh, I get it. I get it.

01:08:01.083 --> 01:08:02.249
- Oh, please.
- You're saying I look like a bartender.

01:08:02.250 --> 01:08:03.916
Is that what the joke is?

01:08:03.917 --> 01:08:05.199
No, I'm saying you look like an idiot.

01:08:05.223 --> 01:08:06.207
Oh!

01:08:06.208 --> 01:08:09.207
Go make us a drink.
Sorry about all this, Kaleb.

01:08:09.208 --> 01:08:12.957
And I got to say, your voice
would stand out on country radio

01:08:12.958 --> 01:08:16.791
because it's so gravelly and
a little bit bluesy-sounding.

01:08:16.792 --> 01:08:18.457
Have you ever made
the trip up to Nashville?

01:08:18.457 --> 01:08:19.876
Have you ever gave it a shot?

01:08:19.901 --> 01:08:21.852
You know, I, uh... I was
in Nashville for a few years,

01:08:21.877 --> 01:08:23.955
songwriting, and I put it to the side,

01:08:23.979 --> 01:08:25.582
and I've been in the corporate world

01:08:25.582 --> 01:08:28.249
for the last seven years,
taking care of my family.

01:08:28.250 --> 01:08:31.624
My wife and my kids and my
friends have continued to say,

01:08:31.625 --> 01:08:34.124
"Don't give it up,"
and I'm here because of them.

01:08:34.125 --> 01:08:36.624
- That's great.
- Nice. That's awesome.

01:08:39.125 --> 01:08:40.749
- That's your family.
- Is that your family?

01:08:40.750 --> 01:08:42.791
I want to bring my kids up.
Can I do that?

01:08:42.792 --> 01:08:44.291
- Yes!
- Please do.

01:08:44.292 --> 01:08:46.999
I got... Graylon is seven, Lily is six,

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.332
and Johander is our... our little boy.

01:08:49.332 --> 01:08:52.917
Oh, he's so cute!

01:08:54.167 --> 01:08:56.499
Look at those boots!

01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:58.166
Your family's so beautiful.

01:08:58.167 --> 01:08:59.640
That is the cutest little boy
I've ever seen.

01:08:59.665 --> 01:09:01.354
And he's, like,
"This is bright and loud."

01:09:01.377 --> 01:09:02.281
Yeah, right?

01:09:02.305 --> 01:09:04.999
So, I think you should just
pretty much shock us all here.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.999
And wouldn't it be great
since I have the same ties...

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.124

I know just the same people he's got.

01:09:14.529 --> 01:09:15.536
- I'm just saying, I...
- That's passion.

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:17.999
- That is passion.
- Kaleb, don't listen to this.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.416

- Don't listen to this.

01:09:19.417 --> 01:09:20.999

about that guy.

01:10:12.083 --> 01:10:14.916

He's obviously a great talent.

01:11:50.125 --> 01:11:52.624
to R&B and black gospel.

01:11:52.625 --> 01:11:54.291
Just last year, I started attending

01:11:54.292 --> 01:11:55.624
Morehead State University.

01:11:55.625 --> 01:11:57.416
We have the black gospel ensemble.

01:11:57.417 --> 01:12:00.416
It's very spiritual, and
the lyrics always tell a story,

01:12:00.417 --> 01:12:02.042
and I really enjoy that.

01:12:03.625 --> 01:12:06.999
Growing up, I've always been
teased for being bigger.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.666
Those mean kids that pretend to
ask you to be their girlfriend

01:12:09.667 --> 01:12:11.624
and then turn around and say,
"Yeah, right."

01:12:11.625 --> 01:12:14.791
It was really tough, but it made
me stronger as a person.

01:12:14.792 --> 01:12:17.124
When I'm performing, it just...

01:12:17.125 --> 01:12:21.874
it sends every trouble and worry
that I have to the wind.

01:12:21.875 --> 01:12:24.541
I'm singing
"Redbone" by Childish Gambino.

01:12:24.542 --> 01:12:29.707
It's funky, it's R&B,
but in a modern fashion.

01:12:29.708 --> 01:12:33.207
It really allows for me to be creative.

01:12:33.208 --> 01:12:34.874
My favorite part about this show

01:12:34.875 --> 01:12:36.874
is definitely the fact
that the auditions are blind.

01:12:36.875 --> 01:12:38.791
It takes a big weight off
of your shoulders to know

01:12:38.792 --> 01:12:40.874
that people aren't going to judge you

01:12:40.875 --> 01:12:43.291
based off of what you look like.

01:12:43.292 --> 01:12:45.791
So, I would love to be a representation

01:12:45.792 --> 01:12:47.707
for all the women
that struggle with weight.

01:12:47.708 --> 01:12:50.166
It's my biggest dream.

01:12:50.167 --> 01:12:51.874
When I walk through those doors,

01:12:51.875 --> 01:12:55.207
I have to leave my all out there
and reach my full potential.

01:12:55.208 --> 01:12:57.333

- Hi, I'm Makenzie Thomas.
- Wow, Makenzie.

01:14:34.333 --> 01:14:36.166
There's so much magic in your voice.

01:14:36.167 --> 01:14:38.499
However, it got a little bit
away from you.

01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:42.166
Honest to God, the good parts,
Makenzie, were fantastic.

01:14:42.167 --> 01:14:44.332
- Thank you.
- I'm just gonna be real.

01:14:44.333 --> 01:14:48.832
You are so unexpected, which
I think is fabulous about you.

01:14:48.833 --> 01:14:51.124
- It's what's gonna make you stand out.
- Thank you.

01:14:51.125 --> 01:14:53.499
You have such a vibe, such an energy.

01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:56.832
And you're totally not what
I expected to turn around to.

01:14:56.833 --> 01:14:58.582
That's what makes this show incredible.

01:14:58.583 --> 01:15:00.916
So, keep doing what you do

01:15:00.917 --> 01:15:03.374
'cause you're onto something so good.

01:15:03.375 --> 01:15:06.166
Thank you so much.

01:15:08.542 --> 01:15:10.707
Makenzie... if she had
a little more control,

01:15:10.708 --> 01:15:12.499
I think she would have gotten
some turns.

01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:14.957
I'm waiting for something special.

01:15:17.667 --> 01:15:19.707
That part stinks.

01:15:19.708 --> 01:15:22.707
God, you've been doing this for
how long and having to see that?

01:15:22.708 --> 01:15:25.666

What's your name?
Where you from? All the crap.

01:15:52.750 --> 01:15:55.041
My name is Justin Kilgore.
I'm 30 years old,

01:15:55.042 --> 01:15:57.916
and I'm originally from a little
town in Texas called Buffalo.

01:15:59.708 --> 01:16:02.874
In Buffalo, there's about
1,200 people that live there.

01:16:02.875 --> 01:16:05.916
The nearest shopping center
was about an hour away.

01:16:10.708 --> 01:16:12.207
I grew up on a farm

01:16:12.208 --> 01:16:15.207
that my family has owned
for over 100 years,

01:16:15.208 --> 01:16:17.541
but I realized early on
that that was definitely

01:16:17.542 --> 01:16:19.041
not gonna be the track for me.

01:16:21.208 --> 01:16:24.874
Buffalo really celebrates
their football team.

01:16:24.875 --> 01:16:26.957
It is like "Friday Night Lights,"

01:16:26.958 --> 01:16:28.707
but it wasn't what I wanted to do,

01:16:28.708 --> 01:16:31.124
so in high school, I decided
to join the cheerleading team.

01:16:31.125 --> 01:16:34.249
It wasn't the most popular
decision for a guy.

01:16:34.250 --> 01:16:36.124
Buffalo... it's a pretty
conservative place.

01:16:36.125 --> 01:16:38.041
Had never been done before.

01:16:38.042 --> 01:16:39.541
But I always knew
I was a little bit different.

01:16:39.542 --> 01:16:41.291
I always kind of knew that I liked guys

01:16:41.292 --> 01:16:44.041
even at a really young age,
but I also knew

01:16:44.042 --> 01:16:46.957
that wasn't something
that I could be open with,

01:16:46.958 --> 01:16:50.124
so I decided to keep that to myself.

01:16:50.125 --> 01:16:52.541
Music really wasn't a part of
the picture growing up,

01:16:52.542 --> 01:16:54.124
but during college,

01:16:54.125 --> 01:16:56.207
I started getting more
interested in country music.

01:16:56.208 --> 01:16:58.916
And then, after college,
decided that I was gonna move

01:16:58.917 --> 01:17:02.457
to the closest music city,
so I moved to Austin, Texas.

01:17:05.792 --> 01:17:07.999
When I started writing original music,

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.749
it was a start, but I was
still hiding who I was.

01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:13.624
I got some doors closed.

01:17:13.625 --> 01:17:16.791
So, the past few years, I just
stopped doing music altogether.

01:17:16.792 --> 01:17:19.916
I've never been out of the
closet when I did country music.

01:17:19.917 --> 01:17:22.666
"The Voice" is the first opportunity

01:17:22.667 --> 01:17:26.832
that I have to be myself
in my entire life.

01:17:26.833 --> 01:17:31.999
I'm so proud of him for
just taking that step forward.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:36.332
And I hope this is his time to
show everyone who he really is.

01:17:36.333 --> 01:17:38.832
I just never really
thought, in my wildest dreams,

01:17:38.833 --> 01:17:40.166
did I think that I would get this far.

01:17:40.167 --> 01:17:41.749
It's big for me

01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:43.624
because I've dreamed about this
my whole life.

01:17:43.625 --> 01:17:44.832
It's finally here.

Reba McEntire... I was obsessed with her

01:20:53.375 --> 01:20:55.832
- when I was a little kid.
- That is so weird!

01:20:57.542 --> 01:21:00.041
Oh, my God,
'cause she's my mommy-in-law!

Do y'all know Reba McEntire?

01:21:07.875 --> 01:21:10.541
I've done a duet with her.
We've had, like, a hit.

01:21:10.542 --> 01:21:12.707
I can't wait for the GIF
that's gonna exist

01:21:12.708 --> 01:21:14.332

say, "Drop it like it's hot."

01:21:21.667 --> 01:21:24.416

- I'll call her.
- I will call Reba McEntire, too.

01:21:27.250 --> 01:21:30.582
- I will call Bonnie Raitt.
- I will call Meryl Streep.

01:21:30.583 --> 01:21:33.041
I will call anybody.

about how we can bring
the most out of you,

01:21:40.375 --> 01:21:42.249
that beautiful voice

all that power that you have
inside of you,

01:21:43.875 --> 01:21:46.207
all that soul that you feel with.

bring the best out of you.

You're so good that I won't even be mad

01:21:54.208 --> 01:21:56.374
- if you don't go with me.
- That's true.

01:21:56.375 --> 01:22:00.791
Because one thing I know
for sure that you can't do

01:22:00.792 --> 01:22:03.457
is go with Blake.

01:22:03.458 --> 01:22:07.124
So, block for Blake is a victory for me.

01:22:08.625 --> 01:22:11.416
Do whatever you want to do.

01:22:11.417 --> 01:22:13.124
And that's all I'm... You're
amazing, dude. You're awesome.

01:22:13.125 --> 01:22:14.958
Thank you so much.

01:22:16.750 --> 01:22:19.082
This is gonna be pathetic
if you do not pick...

01:22:19.083 --> 01:22:21.124
What? Oh, I heard that.

01:22:21.125 --> 01:22:24.291
But I'm j... That was the Lord
saying, "Pick Kelly."

01:22:28.250 --> 01:22:30.207
That was Jesus Christ himself.

01:22:30.208 --> 01:22:32.791
Do not turn away. Follow the light.

01:22:32.792 --> 01:22:34.374
"Follow the light."

01:22:34.375 --> 01:22:37.041
I know country music,
but I'm telling you...

01:22:37.042 --> 01:22:38.457
You don't know anything
about country music.

01:22:38.458 --> 01:22:40.749
I-I know... You are
full of you-know-what.

01:22:40.750 --> 01:22:42.624
Like, I live on a farm. I got chickens.

01:22:42.625 --> 01:22:45.582
I got honeybees. I love...
I'm just saying that...

01:22:46.833 --> 01:22:50.291
that I am a country girl.

01:22:50.292 --> 01:22:54.416
But, man, if you don't pick me...
Oh, my God.

01:22:54.417 --> 01:22:56.124
I was like you. I was a contestant.

01:22:56.125 --> 01:22:58.499
That's my big goal.
It's not just to win this show.

01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:00.624
It's to win longevity for an artist.

01:23:00.625 --> 01:23:02.499
Um, hey, um, Kelly?
Can I tell you something?

01:23:02.500 --> 01:23:04.457
Just the sheer amount of words
that come out of your mouth...

01:23:04.458 --> 01:23:06.166
Whatever, bro. You do the same thing

01:23:06.167 --> 01:23:07.791
- when you're fighting.
- No, not as many words, though.

01:23:07.792 --> 01:23:09.499
That is a lie from Satan's mouth.

01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:11.957
- Um...
- I don't... No!

01:23:11.958 --> 01:23:13.957
- W-What... We're gonna...
- You sit on a throne of lies!

01:23:13.958 --> 01:23:16.291
Let's settle that later.

01:23:16.292 --> 01:23:19.249
Justin, with, of course,
the exception of Blake Shelton

01:23:19.250 --> 01:23:21.791
who is disqualified... Amen.

01:23:23.458 --> 01:23:25.166
Who do you pick as your coach?

01:23:33.292 --> 01:23:35.874
- What?
- That would be pretty cool.

01:23:35.875 --> 01:23:38.957
- That would be pretty cool.
- Come on, come on.

01:23:40.958 --> 01:23:42.874
I pick... Kelly Clarkson.

01:23:42.875 --> 01:23:45.541
- Yes!
- ♪ If you trust your rebel heart ♪

01:23:45.542 --> 01:23:47.166
- I got a country artist!
- ♪ Ride it into battle ♪

01:23:47.167 --> 01:23:49.874
- I got a country artist!
- ♪ Don't be afraid ♪

01:23:49.875 --> 01:23:52.207
♪ Take the road less traveled ♪

01:23:52.208 --> 01:23:53.832
Yes!

01:23:53.833 --> 01:23:56.374
I blocked Blake. I did
what I've been waiting for.

01:23:56.375 --> 01:24:00.499
Just the block alone gave me
pleasure and satisfaction.

01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:02.874
- Next time, baby.
- Yes!

01:24:02.875 --> 01:24:04.916
- I'm so excited!
- Thank you!

01:24:04.917 --> 01:24:07.374
- I got jerseys! Yes!
- Yes, jersey!

01:24:07.375 --> 01:24:10.332
I really feel like Justin
has a lot of potential

01:24:10.333 --> 01:24:12.249
as a great country artist.

01:24:12.250 --> 01:24:14.582
I hate you guys. All three of you.

01:24:14.583 --> 01:24:16.249
- Get away.
- Aw! Waah

01:24:16.250 --> 01:24:18.832
Hate. "Hate" is the word
I'm using to describe.

01:24:18.833 --> 01:24:20.874
"Cry me a river!"

01:24:20.875 --> 01:24:24.999
I can't wait to whop your ass
with a country singer.

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.541
I can't wait.

01:24:27.542 --> 01:24:31.133
Maybe I can get you one of those
Time Life CD sets that has

01:24:31.158 --> 01:24:32.681
- the greatest hits of country music in it...
- Geez. Oh, my God.

01:24:32.706 --> 01:24:34.275
...so you can actually learn
something about it.

01:24:34.300 --> 01:24:35.398
Whatever.
