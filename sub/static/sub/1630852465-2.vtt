54:38.640 --> 54:40.420
- Who am I?

54:40.520 --> 54:43.340
- Sure you want to know,
Elliot?

54:43.440 --> 54:46.940
Yeah.
That's your name.

54:47.040 --> 54:49.040
Elliot Stanley.

54:50.080 --> 54:52.020
And I'll ask you again,
are you sure you want to know

54:52.120 --> 54:54.120
who you really are?

54:54.960 --> 54:58.000
'Cause, mate, you're--
you're not gonna like it.

55:02.680 --> 55:04.700
What are you doing?
- Taking you to the police.

55:04.800 --> 55:06.140
- I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

55:06.240 --> 55:07.500
- Oh, you know what?
I think I will.

55:07.600 --> 55:08.900
Maybe you can explain to them
and to me

55:09.000 --> 55:10.420
just what the fuck
is going on here.

55:10.520 --> 55:12.100
- Okay,
although I'll probably have

55:12.200 --> 55:14.200
to tell them about the part
where you killed someone.

55:17.440 --> 55:20.240
Yeah, told you
you weren't gonna like it.

55:24.240 --> 55:26.260
Elliot Stanley.

55:26.360 --> 55:28.740
Don't you want to know?

55:28.840 --> 55:31.920
Where are you going?

55:39.520 --> 55:41.520
- I need a drink.

55:43.960 --> 55:45.420
- Yeah, that's fair.
