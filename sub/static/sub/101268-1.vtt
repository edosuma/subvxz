WEBVTT

00:46.571 --> 00:48.473
This place is really
out there, isn't it?

00:48.507 --> 00:50.542
Yeah, tell me about it.

00:52.111 --> 00:54.346
This is the turn coming up.

01:05.223 --> 01:06.726
Yeah, this is the straight,

01:06.759 --> 01:08.761
and then the house is just
a half mile up on the left.

01:08.795 --> 01:09.762
Thank God.

01:20.539 --> 01:21.941
What the hell was that?

01:27.546 --> 01:29.347
Haley, let's just go.

01:29.381 --> 01:30.482
Haley, Haley.

01:55.407 --> 01:56.575
There's something
else out there...

01:56.608 --> 01:58.911
Hey, Haley,
seriously, let's go.

02:05.985 --> 02:08.187
Seriously, Haley, let's go.

02:25.604 --> 02:27.173
Haley, get in the car.

02:27.206 --> 02:28.808
Haley, get in the
car, get in the car.

02:28.841 --> 02:30.176
Shoot.

02:50.229 --> 02:51.164
Oh, my God.

03:05.044 --> 03:07.345
- Is anyone out there?
- Hello?

03:07.379 --> 03:08.714
- Hello?
- Haley!

03:08.748 --> 03:10.216
- Haley!
- Haley!

03:10.249 --> 03:11.550
- Hello?
- Haley!

03:12.852 --> 03:14.086
Haley!

03:14.120 --> 03:14.887
Hello?

03:16.122 --> 03:17.657
Hello?

03:17.690 --> 03:18.523
Haley!

03:20.525 --> 03:21.761
- Is anybody out there?
- Hello?

03:21.794 --> 03:22.962
Haley.

03:24.697 --> 03:26.032
- Hello?
- Haley!

03:27.233 --> 03:28.400
Haley!

03:38.911 --> 03:41.314
With sightings
all the way back to the 1970s

03:41.346 --> 03:43.115
by locals and before that by

03:43.149 --> 03:46.484
the Iroquois and Algonquin
nations, Sasquatch,

03:46.518 --> 03:48.587
wow, look at that, very scary,

03:48.620 --> 03:50.289
has been named the
official animal

03:50.323 --> 03:51.757
of the village of Whitehall.

03:51.791 --> 03:53.659
The legend of bigfoot has
been around for quite some time

03:53.693 --> 03:55.962
and obviously there are lots
of mythical monsters that

03:55.995 --> 03:58.396
people claim to have seen;
Loch Ness and things like that,

03:58.430 --> 04:00.833
but there's something about
bigfoot that really endures,

04:00.867 --> 04:03.803
and this town in particular,
Whitehall in New York.

04:03.836 --> 04:06.605
Whitehall, New York has been
a hotbed of bigfoot sightings

04:06.639 --> 04:09.474
over the last several
years, several decades even.

04:09.507 --> 04:11.610
Now, whether there's
any truth to them,

04:11.644 --> 04:13.145
hell, I don't know.

04:13.179 --> 04:15.648
Deer there,
somethin' spooked 'em.

04:15.681 --> 04:17.116
Who knows what.

04:17.149 --> 04:21.153
Could've been us or it
could've been the bigfoot.

04:21.187 --> 04:23.388
That's what we're out here for.

04:23.421 --> 04:26.458
Up here, Whitehall, New
York, the Adirondacks.

04:26.491 --> 04:28.560
I found some classic
bigfoot prints,

04:28.593 --> 04:31.563
but next to them, some
small, similar prints.

04:31.596 --> 04:34.599
Which suggests that bigfoot
may have had an offspring.

04:34.634 --> 04:36.302
Oh, I believe
that bigfoot exists.

04:36.335 --> 04:37.837
The sightings
are very credible.

04:37.870 --> 04:39.305
They don't seem very fake.

04:39.338 --> 04:41.040
These are people who didn't
want to see this thing.

04:41.073 --> 04:44.877
In particular, the stories
from Whitehall are fascinating.

04:44.911 --> 04:46.779
I can't keep away.

04:46.812 --> 04:49.282
This one was kind of a
big blast of foot prints,

04:49.315 --> 04:53.585
but in the past they would
kinda turn up here or there.

04:53.618 --> 04:55.388
In addition to
finding the new tracks,

04:55.420 --> 04:58.590
I put this together with
reports of several young women

04:58.623 --> 05:01.961
having gone missing from
Whitehall in the last few months.

05:01.994 --> 05:04.096
I've seen his prints up here.

05:04.130 --> 05:06.265
I know he's out there.

05:06.299 --> 05:08.100
Sir, are you at
all concerned for your safety?

05:08.134 --> 05:10.435
I'd like to say, I'm not,

05:10.468 --> 05:13.471
but you don't know
what's out there.

05:43.135 --> 05:44.569
Hey, Jamie.

05:44.602 --> 05:46.672
Syl, are you
still coming by later?

05:46.706 --> 05:49.408
Yeah, I'm just finishing up
with the last dog right now.

05:49.442 --> 05:50.843
All right, I think
I found something, okay?

05:50.876 --> 05:52.945
So, hurry up, I'll
see you in a bit.

05:52.979 --> 05:55.848
All right, see ya later.

05:55.881 --> 05:57.683
Lilo.

05:57.717 --> 05:59.517
Whoa, hey, hey, hey, hi.

05:59.551 --> 06:01.287
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

06:01.320 --> 06:02.989
Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.

06:03.022 --> 06:04.589
Okay.

06:05.590 --> 06:06.425
What?

06:07.393 --> 06:08.560
Come on, Lilo.

06:33.252 --> 06:34.286
Oh, yeah.

06:34.320 --> 06:36.122
Christ.

06:37.957 --> 06:40.192
- You want in on this?
- Nah, I'm good.

06:40.226 --> 06:41.427
You sure?

06:41.460 --> 06:42.560
Yeah, I'm not hungry.

06:42.594 --> 06:44.497
It's Taco Loco, come on.

06:44.529 --> 06:45.765
It's my treat.

06:45.798 --> 06:47.466
Didn't that place
get like a C rating?

06:47.500 --> 06:49.035
Better than a D,.

06:49.068 --> 06:51.303
All right, what are
the veggie options?

06:51.337 --> 06:54.874
Yeah, what are your
vegetarian options?

06:54.907 --> 06:55.741
Hm.

06:58.177 --> 07:01.847
Oh, wait, can you get my
mom a chicken quesadilla?

07:01.881 --> 07:04.283
And a chicken quesadilla.

07:04.316 --> 07:06.385
Oh yeah, oh yeah,
that'll be good.

07:06.419 --> 07:08.254
That's all, thank you.

07:09.388 --> 07:12.925
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah.

07:12.958 --> 07:16.095
Oh, my God, how many times
have you watched that thing?

07:16.128 --> 07:17.663
- Hm, hm.
- Yeah?

07:17.696 --> 07:19.732
We need all the
facts that we get.

07:19.765 --> 07:22.567
Did you watch the
documentary I sent you?

07:22.600 --> 07:23.869
- No.
- Hm.

07:23.903 --> 07:25.971
Tomorrow, I
promise I'll do it.

07:26.005 --> 07:28.674
I just, can we
just chill tonight?

07:28.707 --> 07:30.943
I need you to
listen very closely.

07:30.976 --> 07:33.679
- Here we go.
- Oh, yeah.

07:33.712 --> 07:36.949
March 14th, 2015, a
firsthand sighting.

07:38.350 --> 07:41.987
Susan Klein's disappearance,
March 15th, coincidence?

07:42.021 --> 07:46.192
July 7th, 2018, firsthand
sighting, photographic evidence,

07:46.225 --> 07:48.961
and also, a local
noise complaint.

07:48.994 --> 07:51.363
July 12th, Molly
Jenkins disappeared.

07:51.397 --> 07:56.402
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

07:58.337 --> 08:02.274
All in the very woods
the sightings occurred.

08:02.308 --> 08:03.375
All vanished.

08:05.277 --> 08:06.712
It's the Squatch.

08:06.745 --> 08:08.114
I said we're not
calling it that.

08:08.147 --> 08:10.382
You know, it's weird
because never before was there

08:10.416 --> 08:13.953
a reason to believe
that it was aggressive.

08:13.986 --> 08:15.554
Sasquatch keeps to himself

08:15.588 --> 08:17.022
in the woods like
a goddamn ghost.

08:17.056 --> 08:18.023
I mean, that's
why no one can get

08:18.057 --> 08:20.826
a good fuckin' picture of 'em.

08:22.394 --> 08:23.796
Something pissed it off.

08:23.829 --> 08:25.264
No, Jamie, come on.

08:25.297 --> 08:28.334
Come on, there's no
bigfoot, there's no Squatch.

08:28.367 --> 08:30.469
What, yeah, I know, I know,

08:30.503 --> 08:32.837
I agree there's
something weird going on.

08:32.871 --> 08:34.740
I think we should
just focus on that.

08:34.773 --> 08:36.876
Which brings me
to my next point.

08:36.909 --> 08:38.477
Come, take a look at this.

08:38.510 --> 08:41.746
You remember that
guy named Alex?

08:41.780 --> 08:43.215
The mystery man who
paid Dana to take him

08:43.249 --> 08:47.153
to the Adirondacks
before she went missing.

08:47.186 --> 08:50.022
Well, guess who
posted another ad?

08:59.598 --> 09:02.234
You're meeting up with Alex?

09:02.268 --> 09:03.836
More like we are.

09:08.774 --> 09:09.608
No.

09:10.476 --> 09:12.244
- Hear me out...
- No, Jesus.

09:12.278 --> 09:15.080
You wanna meet up with a
potential serial killer

09:15.114 --> 09:16.448
and go on a road trip with him?

09:16.482 --> 09:17.651
What the fuck

09:17.683 --> 09:18.784
- is wrong with you...
- No, no, listen to me.

09:18.817 --> 09:20.052
You won't ever have to

09:20.085 --> 09:21.887
be near him, okay?

09:21.921 --> 09:24.390
He thinks that I'm a girl,
but I'm gonna surprise him,

09:24.423 --> 09:25.991
and then he'll have
to let me drive him

09:26.025 --> 09:27.927
to his place or
it's gonna be weird.

09:27.960 --> 09:29.595
All I need you to
do is be my backup.

09:29.629 --> 09:31.497
I just need you
to drive behind me

09:31.530 --> 09:34.099
in case something happens.

09:34.133 --> 09:36.268
Dana might still be alive.

09:36.302 --> 09:38.437
We're not gonna have
another chance like this.

09:40.105 --> 09:42.408
I need to know what happened.

09:42.441 --> 09:44.678
Or I need to figure it out.

09:46.745 --> 09:48.648
She deserves that much.

09:53.252 --> 09:54.086
Taco Loco.

11:26.445 --> 11:27.346
Hey, mom.

11:28.847 --> 11:31.483
Yeah, no, this morning.

11:31.517 --> 11:32.719
I was just calling to see

11:32.752 --> 11:35.321
if you were gonna
be back for dinner.

11:35.354 --> 11:37.724
I was calling to see if you
were gonna be back for dinner,

11:37.757 --> 11:39.325
I got you a quesa...

11:42.662 --> 11:43.495
Bye, mom.

13:29.736 --> 13:30.569
Shit.

13:40.880 --> 13:42.414
Sylvia, the plan's off.

13:42.448 --> 13:43.515
What?

13:43.549 --> 13:45.685
I said the plan's off.

13:45.718 --> 13:47.386
Are you okay?

13:47.419 --> 13:49.856
Taco Loco got me again.

13:49.889 --> 13:51.724
Are you kidding me?

13:51.758 --> 13:53.292
You were right, okay?

13:53.325 --> 13:55.093
You planned this whole
elaborate thing out,

13:55.127 --> 13:57.563
you guilt trip me into coming,
and then you bail on me?

13:57.596 --> 14:01.634
Sylvia, everything is leaving

14:01.668 --> 14:03.903
my body from
everywhere right now.

14:03.937 --> 14:06.505
Just please try and understand.

14:09.575 --> 14:11.878
What did you say
Alex looks like?

14:11.911 --> 14:13.680
I don't know.

14:13.713 --> 14:18.450
He said, tall, dark hair,
and a denim jacket I think.

14:18.484 --> 14:20.552
I think
Alex is a girl.

14:20.586 --> 14:21.987
What?

14:22.020 --> 14:24.490
You're sure
this is the same ad?

14:24.523 --> 14:26.258
You know that I am.

14:33.298 --> 14:35.067
I'll do it.

14:35.100 --> 14:36.535
No.

14:36.568 --> 14:39.571
No, Sylvia, this, it was
okay when you were gonna be

14:39.605 --> 14:42.574
my backup, but neither of us
should be doing this alone.

14:42.608 --> 14:46.311
- I'm gonna do it.
- No, it is a bad idea.

14:46.345 --> 14:47.914
Look, she already
thinks I'm a girl, right?

14:47.947 --> 14:49.883
I'll just play along.

14:52.284 --> 14:53.653
Bye.

14:53.686 --> 14:56.021
Just remember if things get,

15:00.158 --> 15:02.561
if things get like
out of, hold on.

15:03.763 --> 15:05.130
I'm gonna go, Jamie.

15:05.163 --> 15:08.166
I'll talk to you
later, feel better.

15:36.194 --> 15:37.030
Alex?

15:38.463 --> 15:40.399
Hey, yeah, um, Jamie?

15:43.703 --> 15:44.536
Yeah.

15:49.174 --> 15:51.243
- We said 50 each way, right?
- Mm hm.

16:06.059 --> 16:07.426
- Thanks.
- Mm hm.

16:27.346 --> 16:28.180
Sorry.

16:34.954 --> 16:37.657
So, you always do this?

16:37.690 --> 16:38.825
What?

16:38.858 --> 16:40.125
Road trips with strangers.

16:40.158 --> 16:41.560
Oh, first time.

16:43.161 --> 16:45.098
Well, I appreciate it.

16:45.130 --> 16:46.365
Sure.

16:46.398 --> 16:49.267
So, why the big rush to
get to the Adirondacks?

16:49.301 --> 16:50.302
A wedding.

16:51.269 --> 16:52.304
Congratulations.

16:52.337 --> 16:54.606
Oh, I'm the photographer.

16:55.642 --> 16:58.111
But you're actually saving me.

16:58.143 --> 16:59.344
My ride bailed last minute

16:59.378 --> 17:00.312
and I need to get
there before Monday.

17:00.345 --> 17:01.279
So, thanks.

17:02.649 --> 17:05.217
Oh, yeah, it should take
like a day and a half, I think.

17:05.250 --> 17:06.085
Yeah.

17:09.221 --> 17:11.323
You're still okay
sharing a room, right?

17:11.356 --> 17:14.559
I mean, if I could
afford to I would, but.

17:14.593 --> 17:16.395
No, it's, it's fine.

17:18.964 --> 17:20.298
- Great.
- Great.

17:21.800 --> 17:22.635
Great.

18:19.826 --> 18:21.761
I gotta say, I'm
relieved you're so cool.

18:21.794 --> 18:24.697
I wasn't sure what to expect.

18:24.731 --> 18:27.232
Trust me, I'm not that cool.

18:32.672 --> 18:34.674
Someone checking in on you?

18:34.707 --> 18:35.540
No.

18:37.977 --> 18:38.978
Boyfriend?

18:40.913 --> 18:43.582
It's not really what I go for.

18:44.483 --> 18:46.085
Yeah, me neither.

18:47.754 --> 18:50.123
Yeah, I thought so.

18:50.156 --> 18:53.425
Um, excuse me, you
assumed my sexuality?

18:53.458 --> 18:55.393
- Not cool.
- Well, well,

18:55.427 --> 18:56.829
uh, just a guess.

18:57.997 --> 19:01.234
Don't post something
mean about me online.

19:01.266 --> 19:04.469
Fine, but only because
you're so private on Facebook.

19:04.503 --> 19:05.337
What?

19:06.739 --> 19:08.841
I looked you up when you
answered my ad, and honestly,

19:08.875 --> 19:10.777
I was a little nervous
you were the dude,

19:10.810 --> 19:15.214
but I figured I could just
bail if things got creepy.

19:19.584 --> 19:24.589
You know, it's weird we didn't
run into each other at all.

19:25.457 --> 19:27.126
It's not exactly a big town.

19:27.160 --> 19:27.994
Yeah.

19:29.327 --> 19:31.130
You know, I was
only there a week.

19:31.164 --> 19:35.001
Didn't really see anything
worth checking out.

19:36.501 --> 19:40.006
Yeah, it's a shame we
didn't meet earlier.

19:46.145 --> 19:47.980
We should get going.

20:08.466 --> 20:10.203
- You.
- I, it's fine.

20:27.220 --> 20:28.386
Wine?

20:33.659 --> 20:36.262
So, how deep in
the woods are you?

20:36.295 --> 20:39.198
Should I know how
to fight a bear or?

20:39.232 --> 20:41.499
No, the house is great.

20:41.533 --> 20:44.804
Um, but, honestly,
it's kind of isolated.

20:44.837 --> 20:46.438
So, yeah, study up.

20:47.439 --> 20:48.607
Wait, seriously?

20:48.641 --> 20:50.943
No, no, no, no, it's fine.

20:54.180 --> 20:56.448
There have actually been
some disappearances lately,

20:56.481 --> 20:58.550
but, I mean, as long as
you stay out of the woods,

20:58.583 --> 21:00.452
and you should be good.

21:02.255 --> 21:05.157
Do you think
someone killed them?

21:06.359 --> 21:08.127
No, I think it's more
like people got lost,

21:08.160 --> 21:11.463
but you never know
what's out there, so.

21:13.032 --> 21:14.466
People are weird.

21:16.702 --> 21:19.238
You're right about that.

21:21.841 --> 21:24.110
So, what makes you weird?

21:26.946 --> 21:29.215
Probably a lot of things.

21:31.984 --> 21:34.654
What uh, what makes you weird?

21:39.591 --> 21:41.294
You don't wanna know.

21:52.104 --> 21:54.439
I'm gonna go wash my face.

21:54.472 --> 21:58.878
Okay.

23:14.687 --> 23:15.921
Jamie?

23:16.956 --> 23:17.757
Sorry.

23:19.125 --> 23:20.893
What are you doing?

23:23.329 --> 23:26.399
I'm so, I must've
been sleep walking.

23:26.432 --> 23:27.532
I'm sorry.

23:27.565 --> 23:28.801
It's so embarrassing.

23:28.834 --> 23:31.070
I thought, I didn't know
I was gonna start again.

23:31.103 --> 23:32.405
It's okay, you just scared me.

23:38.411 --> 23:39.245
Sorry.

24:19.151 --> 24:20.618
Hello?

24:20.653 --> 24:21.720
Jamie?

24:21.754 --> 24:23.289
No, no, I can't hear you.

24:23.322 --> 24:24.223
You're breaking up...

24:24.256 --> 24:26.792
Reception's a bitch out here.

24:28.194 --> 24:32.398
Yeah, I'm getting that.

24:32.431 --> 24:35.501
The GPS doesn't work anymore,
but we're close enough.

24:35.534 --> 24:36.769
I know the way.

24:56.188 --> 24:59.258
How long have you
been sleep walking?

25:00.926 --> 25:03.229
I don't know, 12, I guess?

25:03.262 --> 25:06.599
Hm, that's
pretty old to start.

25:09.001 --> 25:10.836
- Maybe I was 10.
- 10.

25:12.271 --> 25:13.739
12 or 10?

25:13.772 --> 25:15.441
Why does it matter?

25:15.474 --> 25:16.675
Well, I just
think it's pretty weird

25:16.709 --> 25:19.745
not to know unless you're lying.

25:19.778 --> 25:23.082
I think we should slow down.

25:23.115 --> 25:24.750
I said, are you a liar?

25:24.783 --> 25:26.652
We're going too fast!

25:26.685 --> 25:29.788
So, you think this is fast?

25:29.822 --> 25:30.656
Stop it!

25:34.493 --> 25:35.761
What the fuck is wrong with you?

25:35.794 --> 25:36.996
What's wrong with me?

25:37.029 --> 25:40.599
I'm not the one snooping
through your shit.

25:40.634 --> 25:43.469
I told you, I
was sleep walking.

25:46.038 --> 25:48.642
You steal in your sleep, too?

25:49.842 --> 25:52.378
Why do you have it?

25:52.411 --> 25:53.245
I hunt.

25:54.413 --> 25:56.949
Where I'm from,
everyone has one.

26:04.690 --> 26:06.025
What are you doing?

26:06.058 --> 26:07.026
Don't like when strangers
touch your things?

26:07.059 --> 26:08.227
Stop it!

26:08.260 --> 26:09.862
Why, you have
something to hide?

26:09.895 --> 26:12.398
Okay, okay, I lied.

26:13.566 --> 26:14.433
Why?

26:15.601 --> 26:18.103
I knew about the
disappearances.

26:19.205 --> 26:20.372
What?

26:21.507 --> 26:22.942
Look, you weren't
online anywhere.

26:22.975 --> 26:27.446
I just wanted to make sure you
were who you said you were.

26:35.554 --> 26:37.256
Listen, Jamie, I
think I should just get

26:37.289 --> 26:39.959
another ride from here.

26:39.992 --> 26:41.193
You can keep the money,

26:41.227 --> 26:44.330
I'm just getting a
little weird for me.

26:44.363 --> 26:45.197
No.

26:48.901 --> 26:51.170
What do you want from me?

28:02.709 --> 28:03.809
Want a drink?

28:07.446 --> 28:08.280
Sure.

28:59.164 --> 29:01.500
It's cool, right?

29:01.533 --> 29:03.402
I'm vegetarian.

29:03.435 --> 29:05.537
We're not gonna eat it.

29:21.688 --> 29:23.622
What's that noise?

29:23.656 --> 29:25.891
Oh, it's this
frequency system.

29:25.924 --> 29:27.025
The ringing will go away soon.

29:27.059 --> 29:28.460
The deer hate it.

32:06.485 --> 32:08.086
Jesus Christ.

32:08.120 --> 32:10.188
Syl, pick up your phone, okay?

32:10.222 --> 32:11.456
Um, I'm worried.

32:11.490 --> 32:12.792
I don't know if you're
getting my messages,

32:12.825 --> 32:15.527
if you're dead,
alive, who knows?

32:15.561 --> 32:18.263
Hi, Syl, yeah, I
thought maybe 20th time

32:18.297 --> 32:20.265
would be the charmer.

32:20.299 --> 32:21.500
Apparently not.

32:21.533 --> 32:23.302
I don't know if you're
getting any of messages,

32:23.335 --> 32:24.771
or perhaps you're dead.

32:24.804 --> 32:26.706
So, if you get a chance, maybe
just give me a call back.

32:26.739 --> 32:28.507
If not, I'll see
you around 10:30

32:28.540 --> 32:30.977
when I arrive there tonight.

32:31.010 --> 32:32.611
Anyway, I miss you.

32:34.146 --> 32:36.950
Bye.

32:47.593 --> 32:49.261
Where is this place?

32:54.099 --> 32:55.233
Fuck!

33:11.249 --> 33:12.051
Thanks.

33:25.163 --> 33:26.498
You all right?

33:26.531 --> 33:27.934
Yeah, I'm fine.

33:36.042 --> 33:36.876
What?

33:39.177 --> 33:40.245
Stay there.

33:50.389 --> 33:52.424
No, I'm embarrassed.

33:52.457 --> 33:55.028
Come on, you're fine.

34:15.213 --> 34:16.114
Just relax.

35:00.993 --> 35:05.597
You really aren't bothered
by any of the disappearances?

35:05.631 --> 35:08.233
Are you seriously
bringing that up right now?

35:15.240 --> 35:19.078
They just, they all
happened so close to here.

35:22.949 --> 35:26.719
I mean, yeah, I don't
like it, obviously.

35:26.753 --> 35:30.823
But I don't know, I just,
I don't think about it.

35:32.158 --> 35:34.827
Why are you so obsessed with it?

35:38.263 --> 35:40.099
My name's not Jamie.

35:43.636 --> 35:45.171
What?

35:45.204 --> 35:46.371
It's Sylvia.

35:50.308 --> 35:52.812
Why do you keep lying to me?

35:57.049 --> 36:01.120
I had this friend, Dana,
best friend, actually.

36:03.388 --> 36:06.626
She's one of the
women who disappeared.

36:07.894 --> 36:10.295
I had this insane idea
that if I came here

36:10.328 --> 36:12.799
I could find out
what happened to her.

36:12.832 --> 36:14.533
She had answered an ad online

36:14.566 --> 36:17.970
asking for a driver
to take her here.

36:18.004 --> 36:21.774
The same recent one that
I responded to, yours.

36:23.676 --> 36:26.279
You think I killed her?

36:26.311 --> 36:30.183
Wasn't sure.

36:30.216 --> 36:31.050
And now?

36:36.889 --> 36:41.393
Look, I told the cops, she
drove me here and she left,

36:42.962 --> 36:46.732
and I thought that
was the end of it.

36:46.766 --> 36:47.599
Okay.

36:52.305 --> 36:54.040
I don't like liars.

36:55.340 --> 36:56.341
I'm sorry.

37:18.097 --> 37:19.598
Hello, yeah?

37:19.632 --> 37:22.301
An enforcement action
executed by the U.S. Treasury.

37:22.335 --> 37:23.602
- Ah, fuck you!
- Requesting...

37:23.636 --> 37:25.437
- Come on.
- Your serious attention.

37:25.470 --> 37:29.242
Ignoring this will be
an intentional second...

37:31.744 --> 37:32.678
You gotta be fucking

37:32.712 --> 37:33.646
kidding me.

37:46.325 --> 37:47.960
Come on, come on.

37:47.994 --> 37:50.595
Just give me one bar, just one.

38:19.792 --> 38:22.728
Just one bar, just
give me one bar.

38:39.278 --> 38:40.112
Oh, shit.

39:45.911 --> 39:47.747
I let my sister die.

39:51.917 --> 39:52.752
What?

39:57.156 --> 39:58.991
I was in high
school and I tried one

39:59.025 --> 40:01.227
of my mom's cigarettes
in her room.

40:01.260 --> 40:03.329
Lit some candles to
try to cover it up,

40:03.362 --> 40:05.931
and I accidentally left one on.

40:07.066 --> 40:08.501
There was a fire.

40:09.702 --> 40:11.037
It was my fault.

40:14.306 --> 40:17.542
I tried to get to
her, I just couldn't.

40:18.444 --> 40:21.113
All that smoke, I just couldn't.

40:22.815 --> 40:24.817
My mom, who was a nurse,

40:25.951 --> 40:29.554
didn't come visit me
in the hospital at all.

40:30.456 --> 40:32.224
I know she blames me.

40:34.326 --> 40:35.327
She's right.

40:37.696 --> 40:38.764
I killed her.

40:48.774 --> 40:50.709
You aren't a monster.

41:27.880 --> 41:29.782
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

41:31.717 --> 41:32.551
Tell me.

41:47.867 --> 41:50.703
Sometimes I think
I hate myself.

43:32.304 --> 43:33.973
No, I look horrible.

43:35.307 --> 43:36.875
You're beautiful.

43:38.911 --> 43:40.846
Where are my clothes?

43:56.862 --> 43:57.997
Syl,
pick up your phone.

43:58.030 --> 43:59.733
Yeah, I'm gonna be
there by 10:30 tonight.

43:59.765 --> 44:02.368
So, maybe I'll see you there.

44:02.401 --> 44:03.902
Or you can just
give me a call back

44:03.936 --> 44:05.904
if you're not dead already.

44:05.938 --> 44:09.108
Fuck.

45:09.234 --> 45:10.069
What?

45:11.638 --> 45:12.806
What the fuck?

45:18.110 --> 45:21.280
Fuck!

45:38.765 --> 45:39.598
Oh, shit.

46:20.939 --> 46:23.743
What's going on?

46:23.777 --> 46:26.278
There's something out there.

46:31.583 --> 46:33.085
You knew about it.

46:36.088 --> 46:37.657
We're safe in here.

46:37.690 --> 46:38.858
How?

46:38.892 --> 46:39.992
That ringing
you heard earlier,

46:40.025 --> 46:41.427
it's an electromagnetic
frequency system

46:41.460 --> 46:43.362
that thing can't stand.

46:44.463 --> 46:47.466
The markers in the driveway.

46:47.499 --> 46:50.235
It's really meant for deer,
but that thing hates it.

46:50.269 --> 46:53.105
So, as long as
it's on we're safe.

46:55.374 --> 46:57.710
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

46:59.545 --> 47:01.447
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

47:09.856 --> 47:12.257
You're safe with me.

47:12.291 --> 47:13.358
You trust me?

47:17.664 --> 47:18.564
Let's go get a drink.

47:18.597 --> 47:20.532
We're not gonna sleep tonight.

47:38.417 --> 47:39.485
You're quiet.

47:40.854 --> 47:41.688
Sorry.

47:45.390 --> 47:46.992
Sylvia, I've been
living here for years.

47:47.025 --> 47:50.295
As long as you're
with me, you're safe.

47:54.667 --> 47:57.536
Did you make it to your car?

47:57.569 --> 47:58.403
No.

47:59.939 --> 48:02.007
I didn't wanna leave you.

48:03.843 --> 48:07.613
Well, I wouldn't
blame you if you did.

48:07.647 --> 48:08.480
Sure.

48:10.549 --> 48:14.553
Seriously though,
why'd you come back?

48:14.586 --> 48:16.823
I didn't wanna ditch you.

48:30.335 --> 48:35.274
You know, I used to have this
old fat beagle named Banjo.

48:36.976 --> 48:39.411
My dad and I used
to take him hunting

48:39.444 --> 48:43.515
and he'd run ahead howling,
pointing at squirrels.

48:43.549 --> 48:44.884
Once a year we'd
have a competition

48:44.918 --> 48:48.320
to see who could
score a deer first.

48:48.353 --> 48:53.125
We'd all split up and Banjo
would always follow me.

48:53.158 --> 48:54.894
Every year I'd
lose because Banjo

48:54.928 --> 48:59.598
was always right there howling,
scaring everything away.

49:03.168 --> 49:07.105
When I was 16, though,
I had this perfect shot.

49:08.574 --> 49:10.743
A giant buck with huge antlers,

49:10.777 --> 49:14.948
lined up right in front
of me about 200 feet away.

49:18.017 --> 49:20.552
Didn't even know I was there,

49:20.586 --> 49:25.591
but out of the corner of my
eye I see old Banjo and he gets

49:27.026 --> 49:30.395
this look on his face and I
know that he's about to howl.

49:31.530 --> 49:34.701
So, I shot him and
then I shot the deer,

49:36.970 --> 49:38.236
and then I won.

49:42.075 --> 49:43.609
You shot your dog?

49:43.643 --> 49:44.476
I won.

54:25.091 --> 54:27.059
Okay, listen.

54:27.093 --> 54:27.927
Listen.

54:30.196 --> 54:31.496
It's gonna be okay.

54:31.529 --> 54:33.032
It's gonna be fine now.

54:33.065 --> 54:34.333
Wait.

54:48.814 --> 54:49.815
Wait.

54:49.849 --> 54:51.616
It's okay.

54:58.556 --> 55:01.928
What is that?

55:03.963 --> 55:07.465
Sylvia?

55:13.272 --> 55:15.141
I will be right back.

55:15.174 --> 55:16.943
No, no, no, no, no.

55:17.910 --> 55:19.078
- No.
- I won't leave you.

55:19.111 --> 55:21.113
- Okay.
- I know what I have to do.

55:21.147 --> 55:23.849
Okay?

55:23.883 --> 55:27.987
I won't leave you.

55:46.538 --> 55:47.974
What's going on?

55:48.007 --> 55:50.242
I thought I heard a noise.

55:50.276 --> 55:52.812
I told you you're safe in
here and you keep wandering off.

55:52.845 --> 55:54.512
I know, I'm sorry.

55:57.083 --> 55:59.517
Well, now I'm up again, so.

56:10.029 --> 56:12.398
So, tell me about your sister.

56:12.431 --> 56:13.265
What?

56:14.467 --> 56:17.169
Your sister,
what was she like?

56:18.738 --> 56:21.240
I don't talk about her.

56:21.273 --> 56:22.108
Why not?

56:25.277 --> 56:27.847
It still bothers you that much.

56:31.017 --> 56:32.617
Must've been a really
interesting kid.

56:32.651 --> 56:35.388
Don't talk about her.

56:35.421 --> 56:36.655
Just curious.

56:41.961 --> 56:43.396
Are you happy you
figured it out?

56:43.429 --> 56:44.263
What?

56:45.731 --> 56:47.500
What happened to Dana.

56:47.532 --> 56:50.036
It's what you came for, right?

56:51.871 --> 56:54.006
Didn't really make
me feel any better.

56:54.040 --> 56:54.874
No?

56:56.208 --> 56:58.878
The closure didn't help?

56:58.911 --> 57:01.414
Not like I thought it would.

57:02.580 --> 57:03.581
I'm sorry.

57:06.685 --> 57:09.121
I'm not really in the mood.

57:10.489 --> 57:11.323
Right.

57:16.862 --> 57:21.867
You know, whenever this all
ends, I'll be sad to see you go.

57:23.002 --> 57:25.704
You're not like
other girls, you're,

57:27.239 --> 57:30.476
there's just something
heavy about you.

57:32.144 --> 57:32.978
Anger.

57:34.747 --> 57:36.916
I just feel like I
can relate to you,

57:36.949 --> 57:37.983
and that doesn't happen often.

57:38.017 --> 57:40.186
I can't stand most people.

57:43.689 --> 57:44.924
I'm not angry.

57:44.957 --> 57:46.292
Well, come on.

57:47.693 --> 57:51.697
"Sometimes I think I
hate myself," remember?

57:51.730 --> 57:52.631
Your words.

58:00.439 --> 58:02.607
Where are you going?

58:02.641 --> 58:05.010
I'm going to the basement,
I need to grab something.

58:05.044 --> 58:05.878
What?

58:07.680 --> 58:09.415
What's the problem?

58:23.429 --> 58:25.264
Let's go upstairs.

58:25.297 --> 58:26.132
Okay.

58:45.684 --> 58:49.355
So, I guess you aren't
making it to that wedding, huh?

58:49.388 --> 58:50.222
Yeah.

58:53.225 --> 58:56.328
Must be hard to
find work out here.

58:58.531 --> 58:59.932
Yeah, I guess.

58:59.965 --> 59:00.799
Why?

59:02.268 --> 59:05.037
Just because of
the no service.

59:07.907 --> 59:10.709
Hey, what would you have
done if you were right?

59:10.743 --> 59:11.577
What?

59:12.678 --> 59:13.979
If I was the one
killing all those girls,

59:14.013 --> 59:16.048
what would you have done?

59:19.919 --> 59:21.387
I don't know.

59:21.420 --> 59:22.588
It was stupid.

59:23.889 --> 59:26.892
Well, you would've
done something.

59:31.597 --> 59:35.701
Come here.

59:44.678 --> 59:46.579
You are so beautiful.

59:55.554 --> 59:57.590
Do you think I'm
a fucking idiot?

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:01.520
I knew it.

01:01:03.222 --> 01:01:04.590
I'm guessing you
saw my photo lab?

01:01:04.623 --> 01:01:05.858
Shut up.

01:01:05.891 --> 01:01:07.694
Look at you, big, big Sylvia.

01:01:07.727 --> 01:01:09.194
I said, shut up!

01:01:10.396 --> 01:01:11.930
There's the rage.

01:01:13.832 --> 01:01:15.034
Stay, you fuckin'...

01:01:15.067 --> 01:01:17.303
No, without
power, we're fucked.

01:01:17.336 --> 01:01:18.504
I need to get downstairs.

01:01:18.537 --> 01:01:20.172
No, you're not
moving a fucking inch...

01:01:20.205 --> 01:01:24.610
Sylvia, you have no idea
what this thing is capable of.

01:01:24.644 --> 01:01:26.078
I'm not letting you go.

01:01:26.111 --> 01:01:28.782
You haven't seen
what I've seen.

01:01:28.814 --> 01:01:32.217
It will make you
wish you were dead.

01:01:32.251 --> 01:01:34.754
I have to get to the basement.

01:02:44.456 --> 01:02:45.290
Shut it.

01:04:42.976 --> 01:04:45.143
What did you do to my car?

01:04:46.813 --> 01:04:48.882
What's the rush?

01:04:50.750 --> 01:04:51.751
I saw her.

01:04:53.385 --> 01:04:54.888
I saw all of them.

01:04:56.321 --> 01:04:57.155
And?

01:05:01.661 --> 01:05:03.395
You're not like them.

01:05:04.296 --> 01:05:05.965
Who are...

01:07:52.431 --> 01:07:53.866
Sylvia?

01:07:55.467 --> 01:07:57.103
Jamie.

01:08:00.139 --> 01:08:01.641
Oh, my God.

01:08:01.674 --> 01:08:05.277
- Dude, where were you?
- I have no idea.

01:08:05.310 --> 01:08:06.913
I saw it, I saw it.

01:08:09.882 --> 01:08:11.117
The last thing I
remember is Squatch

01:08:11.150 --> 01:08:12.952
beating the shit outta
me, waking up in dirt,

01:08:12.985 --> 01:08:14.352
and then I, I, I, I get up

01:08:14.386 --> 01:08:18.091
and I'm wandering around
looking for you and.

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:36.241
It's gonna kill us.

01:08:36.274 --> 01:08:40.278
I think if it wanted
to kill us, we'd be dead.

01:08:42.048 --> 01:08:44.515
You need to set it.

01:08:44.549 --> 01:08:46.152
What?

01:08:46.185 --> 01:08:48.353
My arm, it's dislocated.

01:08:49.386 --> 01:08:50.923
Fuck no.

01:08:50.957 --> 01:08:52.125
You need a hospital.

01:08:52.158 --> 01:08:55.292
- Jamie, come on.
- No, I can't.

01:09:03.836 --> 01:09:05.337
It's a grave site.

01:09:07.073 --> 01:09:09.508
That's how they bury each other.

01:09:09.541 --> 01:09:10.442
You would know
that if you watched

01:09:10.475 --> 01:09:12.812
that documentary I sent you.

01:09:13.779 --> 01:09:14.680
The fuck?

01:09:17.415 --> 01:09:19.417
Syl I, I don't get it.

01:09:24.288 --> 01:09:26.524
I don't know why
it didn't kill us.

01:09:26.558 --> 01:09:29.729
You know, all those
girls, but not us, I.

01:09:29.761 --> 01:09:31.563
It didn't kill Dana.

01:09:31.595 --> 01:09:32.596
What?

01:09:32.631 --> 01:09:37.170
But you.

01:09:37.203 --> 01:09:38.037
Alex?

01:09:43.975 --> 01:09:44.810
Fuck.

01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:50.515
You, you remember my
birthday last year?

01:09:51.884 --> 01:09:53.484
Yeah.

01:09:53.518 --> 01:09:55.054
Dana, she was
obsessed with hanging

01:09:55.087 --> 01:09:56.956
those stupid twinkling
lights for it.

01:09:58.925 --> 01:10:00.693
Oh, please, you
still have 'em up.

01:10:00.726 --> 01:10:03.663
Because she hung
'em really high.

01:10:05.231 --> 01:10:06.431
And then I had to show her

01:10:06.464 --> 01:10:07.800
that stupid fuckin'
post the next day.

01:10:07.834 --> 01:10:11.570
You know, I knew she
was gonna go, all alone.

01:10:14.073 --> 01:10:15.975
It wasn't your fault.

01:10:19.779 --> 01:10:20.612
Yeah.

01:10:24.516 --> 01:10:26.252
You need to set it.

01:10:27.385 --> 01:10:29.487
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

01:10:32.591 --> 01:10:33.425
Dammit.

01:10:35.094 --> 01:10:36.361
Talk me through it.

01:10:36.394 --> 01:10:37.596
Come here.

01:10:37.630 --> 01:10:39.165
- Sit down.
- Okay.

01:10:39.198 --> 01:10:40.733
- Most important thing.
- Yeah.

01:10:40.766 --> 01:10:42.902
45 degrees, you gotta pull it,

01:10:42.935 --> 01:10:44.337
- put it back into place.
- I hate math problems.

01:10:44.369 --> 01:10:45.604
- You ready?
- No.

01:10:46.873 --> 01:10:47.707
But do it.

01:10:48.908 --> 01:10:49.742
Okay.

01:10:51.177 --> 01:10:53.846
- One, two...
- Don't fuckin' count.

01:10:55.547 --> 01:10:56.782
Okay.

01:10:58.918 --> 01:11:01.654
God, fuck.

01:11:01.687 --> 01:11:04.857
- Oh, my...
- That was the worst.

01:11:04.891 --> 01:11:08.327
Yeah, it wasn't
good for me either.

01:11:09.896 --> 01:11:11.898
Put it down.

01:11:11.931 --> 01:11:14.000
I said, put it down!

01:11:14.033 --> 01:11:14.934
I'm sorry.

01:11:35.021 --> 01:11:36.588
I have to go back.

01:11:36.621 --> 01:11:37.455
Where?

01:11:38.991 --> 01:11:40.393
To the house?

01:11:40.425 --> 01:11:44.664
No, yeah, well what
about the fuckin' police?

01:11:44.697 --> 01:11:47.199
- She has another girl.
- Shit.

01:11:49.869 --> 01:11:52.038
Can you get to your car?

01:11:53.139 --> 01:11:54.539
Yeah, probably.

01:11:57.944 --> 01:11:58.744
Okay.

01:12:00.713 --> 01:12:01.914
Pick me up at the house.

01:12:01.948 --> 01:12:05.017
No, no, I don't
want you going alone.

01:12:05.051 --> 01:12:07.320
You can barely walk.

01:12:07.353 --> 01:12:09.454
We don't know how much time
we have before she kills her...

01:12:09.487 --> 01:12:10.756
Hey, what's your plan?

01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:12.258
She has some kind
of frequency system

01:12:12.291 --> 01:12:13.458
that keeps that thing away.

01:12:13.491 --> 01:12:15.194
Like a deer repellent?

01:12:15.227 --> 01:12:19.432
Yeah, something about the
sound, it can't stand it.

01:12:19.464 --> 01:12:22.168
Look, if I can get to the
basement I can shut the power off.

01:12:22.201 --> 01:12:24.337
Alex will have no where to hide.

01:12:24.370 --> 01:12:28.708
I can grab Molly, I can
get her outta there.

01:12:28.741 --> 01:12:30.009
She has videos.

01:12:34.647 --> 01:12:35.448
Dana?

01:12:38.084 --> 01:12:38.918
You sure?

01:12:42.355 --> 01:12:44.522
This can't happen again.

01:12:45.725 --> 01:12:47.226
I couldn't live myself.

01:12:47.259 --> 01:12:49.862
I don't think you could either.

01:12:51.964 --> 01:12:56.802
Be careful, yeah?

01:13:00.172 --> 01:13:01.007
Ah, fuck.

01:13:11.183 --> 01:13:12.418
Yeah.

01:13:12.451 --> 01:13:13.252
Fuck me.

01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:15.755
Fuck me.

01:13:20.259 --> 01:13:21.593
Don't, no, no.

01:13:22.695 --> 01:13:24.830
You know what?

01:13:24.864 --> 01:13:28.167
This might make everything you
did to me actually worth it.

01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:32.304
For this moment.

01:13:46.152 --> 01:13:46.986
Don't.

01:13:48.654 --> 01:13:49.488
Why?

01:13:51.457 --> 01:13:52.758
Why not?

01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:45.211
Ooh, boy.

01:15:23.182 --> 01:15:24.416
Welcome back.

01:15:27.153 --> 01:15:29.221
Sit down, I'm making tea.

01:15:31.624 --> 01:15:36.328
You know, you're the only
one to ever suspect me.

01:15:36.362 --> 01:15:38.097
Part of me didn't
even wanna kill you.

01:15:38.130 --> 01:15:39.698
I mean, we had fun.

01:15:45.771 --> 01:15:47.373
Could even have more time.

01:15:47.406 --> 01:15:50.509
It was a lot less
complicated before.

01:16:18.537 --> 01:16:20.539
I guess I pissed it off.

01:16:22.441 --> 01:16:23.409
But it doesn't matter anyway.

01:16:23.442 --> 01:16:26.011
It all would've ended the same.

01:16:27.346 --> 01:16:30.082
We are what this fucked
up world made us to be,

01:16:30.115 --> 01:16:31.217
and you're only here

01:16:31.250 --> 01:16:33.319
because you let someone
else die, right?

01:16:33.352 --> 01:16:34.688
But you're here.

01:16:36.922 --> 01:16:37.756
Ow.

01:16:43.495 --> 01:16:46.799
Go ahead, you're already
a murderer, right?

01:18:16.855 --> 01:18:17.691
No!

01:18:17.724 --> 01:18:19.024
Stop!

01:20:43.770 --> 01:20:44.603
No, no.

01:22:10.690 --> 01:22:11.590
Hey, Syl.

01:22:13.358 --> 01:22:14.761
Syl?

01:22:14.794 --> 01:22:15.628
Hey.

01:22:16.763 --> 01:22:18.063
You're alive.

01:22:50.863 --> 01:22:52.865
I can't believe we
saw the Squatch.
