<i> [boy] In case some of you
don't remember,</i>

00:14.912 --> 00:18.245
<i> my name is Johnny Kapahala.
I've probably changed a litte</i>

00:18.312 --> 00:20.713
<i> since the last time
some of you saw me.</i>

00:20.778 --> 00:24.612
<i> A few years ago, I moved from
 sunny Hawaii to snowy Vermont.</i>

00:24.679 --> 00:27.980
<i> Traded my surfboard for a
snowboard. But this week,</i>

00:28.047 --> 00:29.946
<i> if I'd have known
what was coming,</i>

00:30.013 --> 00:31.680
<i> what a wild ride it would be,</i>

00:31.746 --> 00:34.447
<i> I might have just
stayed on the mountain.</i>

00:45.015 --> 00:47.814
Whoa! Whoa!

00:47.881 --> 00:50.149
No! No! No!

00:50.215 --> 00:54.349
[screaming]

01:02.448 --> 01:04.983
[continues screaming]

01:08.283 --> 01:09.683
Whoa!

01:11.082 --> 01:13.251
Whoa!

01:21.751 --> 01:23.386
Whoa!

01:25.317 --> 01:27.051
<i> [man] Johnny. Johnny.</i>

01:27.117 --> 01:30.685
[gasps, sighs]

01:30.751 --> 01:32.952
- You OK?
- Yup.

01:33.918 --> 01:35.751
Gnarly dream.

01:35.819 --> 01:38.620
- How does it feel
to be back in Hawaii?
- Awesome.

01:38.686 --> 01:42.086
- Like we've been away forever.
- Never thought we'd come back

01:42.153 --> 01:44.153
to see my father get,
you know...

01:44.218 --> 01:46.652
Hitched? Tied down? Hooked up?

01:46.718 --> 01:49.420
- How about just "married?"
- [sighs]

01:49.487 --> 01:52.721
- Are you OK with this, Dad?
- No. Yeah, I'm good.

01:52.787 --> 01:55.920
It's because we haven't met
Grandpa's squeeze yet, isn't i?

01:55.987 --> 02:00.421
- Her name is Carla.
- No, that's not it.

02:00.489 --> 02:02.655
This is about Carla's son,
isn't it?

02:02.721 --> 02:05.021
Well, don't you think
it's just a little strange?

02:05.087 --> 02:09.288
I've always been an only child
and now, what's his name, Chri?

02:09.354 --> 02:11.423
Dad hasn't said
two words about him.

02:11.487 --> 02:13.921
I think it's nice that Johnny's
gonna have an uncle.

02:15.256 --> 02:17.955
Dad, this isn't the way
to Grandpa's house.

02:18.021 --> 02:20.355
We're gonna stay in the city
for a couple of days.

02:20.421 --> 02:21.823
Your dad has a
business meeting

02:21.889 --> 02:24.689
and, uh, I wanna
buy some summer clothes.

02:24.756 --> 02:27.590
OK, well, how am I
supposed to get there?

02:27.657 --> 02:31.324
[father] We arranged a ride
with a friend of ours.

02:33.556 --> 02:37.923
- [mother chuckles]
- What up?

02:37.991 --> 02:40.257
Sam!

02:40.324 --> 02:43.224
Sam. Ah! What's up, man?

02:43.290 --> 02:45.125
- [both grunting]
- Yeah!

02:45.192 --> 02:47.225
- You gonna be OK, Johnny?
- How's it, bro?

02:47.292 --> 02:49.957
I'm good, man. Better,
now that my boy is here!

02:50.025 --> 02:54.092
- I think he'll be fine.
- [Sam] You got ugly on me, ma.

02:54.158 --> 02:56.258
- See you at Grandpa's.
- You look good, bro.

02:56.325 --> 02:57.393
Thanks, man!

03:04.258 --> 03:07.126
[rock music plays]

03:14.328 --> 03:16.728
Aloha, sun!

03:16.794 --> 03:20.460
- Aloha, palm trees!
- Yo, yo. Chill, bro.

03:20.527 --> 03:23.727
I mean, I'm the one that's
been in Iceland for
four years, remember?

03:23.794 --> 03:25.761
- Yeah.
- I should be the one saying...

03:25.828 --> 03:29.262
<i>Oh,  mahalo , Hawaii. [laugh]</i>

03:29.328 --> 03:32.829
- Hey, hey, hey,
eyes front, junior!
- I got it.

03:32.895 --> 03:36.829
Whew! Man, I still can't
believe you live here.

03:36.895 --> 03:39.329
[Sam] Yeah. I thought it
was a joke when Dad told me

03:39.396 --> 03:42.662
he was transferred here to
Hickam. Whoa, bro, check it ou.

03:42.729 --> 03:44.729
[rock music plays]

04:06.865 --> 04:09.799
- You saw that, right?
- Uh, yeah.

04:12.365 --> 04:15.299
[Johnny laughs]
All right, man.

04:16.565 --> 04:19.630
- All right, thanks for this.
- All right, OK.

04:19.699 --> 04:21.798
- Tell your grandpa I said hi.
- You got it.

04:21.865 --> 04:24.300
- All right, man. Push out.
- Later.

04:30.333 --> 04:31.634
Grandpa?

04:33.500 --> 04:35.533
Right on. Surf's up.

04:56.935 --> 04:58.402
What is this?

05:08.170 --> 05:09.871
[grunts]

05:11.569 --> 05:14.004
Whoa! Ah!

05:16.137 --> 05:19.204
Hey! [grunts]

05:22.603 --> 05:25.237
I told you, this is stupid!

05:25.305 --> 05:27.971
- I don't want to surf!
- Hey!

05:33.072 --> 05:34.272
Hey, Grandpa!

05:37.540 --> 05:42.007
Hey, Pono! [laughs]

05:42.072 --> 05:43.939
What's up?

05:44.007 --> 05:47.173
Hey, how are you, Pono?

05:47.240 --> 05:51.341
- Nice haircut!
Kinda short, huh?
- [laughs] Yeah.

05:51.406 --> 05:54.539
Whoa! [laughs]
I never thought I'd see that.

05:54.607 --> 05:57.075
Well,
let me tell you, Pono,

05:57.141 --> 05:59.007
there are plenty of changes
around here.

05:59.074 --> 06:02.840
- Like you giving surf lessons?
- Ah, only to tourists.

06:02.906 --> 06:06.008
- Why, you need one?
- Who you callin' a tourist?

06:06.074 --> 06:07.109
[both laugh]

06:09.442 --> 06:13.108
- Hey, you got a visitor.
- Oh, no, that's not a visitor.

06:13.175 --> 06:17.141
That's my Carla, Pono. [laughs]
You ready for this?

06:17.209 --> 06:19.875
If you love her, Grandpa,
I know I'll love her.

06:19.942 --> 06:22.377
- That's my grandson.
- [chuckles]

06:22.442 --> 06:24.910
- [laughs] Hey.
- Hey.

06:24.976 --> 06:27.075
- Carla, this is Johnny.
- Nice to meet you.

06:27.142 --> 06:31.676
Oh, give me a hug!
I have heard so much about you!

06:31.744 --> 06:33.810
- Great to meet you.
- It's good to meet you too.

06:33.877 --> 06:37.043
- Should we go inside?
I made dinner.
- Yes!

06:37.110 --> 06:40.010
[Carla] Where's Chris?
I thought he was with you.

06:40.076 --> 06:43.511
Hey, he'll be here.
He's hungry.

06:43.576 --> 06:47.677
- Mmm, I smell
Huli Huli chicken.
- [Grandpa] Your favorite.

06:47.745 --> 06:51.745
I'll have you know it was
the first Hawaiian dish

06:51.812 --> 06:53.379
that I learned to make.

06:53.444 --> 06:56.611
Oh, hey, Johnny, um,
about your room.

06:56.678 --> 06:59.179
Um, the house that
I'm renting down the beach

06:59.247 --> 07:02.879
ended up being small, so Chris
stays here. Hope that's OK.

07:02.946 --> 07:06.014
Totally cool. You know,
I can't wait to meet him.

07:06.079 --> 07:09.147
Never had an uncle.
He might not want to
hang around with a teenager,

07:09.213 --> 07:11.014
but I've always
related well to adults.

07:11.081 --> 07:13.013
- [footsteps approaching]
- Uh, Johnny...

07:13.079 --> 07:14.813
- What?
- [Grandpa] There's, uh...

07:19.680 --> 07:22.514
- No.
- That's my Chris.

07:22.581 --> 07:26.181
[door slams]

07:26.247 --> 07:29.615
- Your new uncle.
- [objects clattering
and banging]

07:29.682 --> 07:32.081
- [video game sound effects]
- [knock on door]

07:32.149 --> 07:33.516
Hey, Chris.

07:35.581 --> 07:39.016
- This is Johnny.
- Hey.

07:39.083 --> 07:42.717
- This, uh, used to be his roo.
- Yup.

07:42.783 --> 07:46.283
Yeah, well, uh, he can have it.
It smells like fish.

07:46.350 --> 07:50.983
Dude, that's just the salt air,
or... it might actually be fis.

07:51.050 --> 07:53.617
[laughs] I used to bring
buckets of stuff in here.

07:53.684 --> 07:56.084
Mom thought it was gross,
but Grandpa was cool.

07:56.151 --> 07:58.317
[laughs] Yeah.

08:00.350 --> 08:02.850
Well, Chris had his
first surfing lesson today.

08:02.918 --> 08:05.518
- Yeah, that's right.
That was, um...
- Lame.

08:05.584 --> 08:09.717
I was gonna say cool, but,
um, dude, I totally understand.

08:09.785 --> 08:12.585
When I was first learning,
I wiped out constantly.

08:12.651 --> 08:14.718
[both laugh]

08:14.785 --> 08:17.853
- Well, Chris is
gonna surf just fine.
- Yeah.

08:17.918 --> 08:19.887
He just needs practice.
Right, Chris?

08:23.720 --> 08:25.187
OK.

08:31.586 --> 08:33.120
[sighs]

08:36.720 --> 08:38.388
[Grandpa] Oh, unreal, huh?

08:38.453 --> 08:42.386
We don't got waves like this in
Vermont, I tell you that much.

08:42.455 --> 08:45.687
- Chris is a real
challenge, huh?
- Uh-huh.

08:45.754 --> 08:48.587
[laughs] Come on, Pono,
you can say it.

08:48.653 --> 08:51.754
Look, I'm sure Chris is totally
cool once you get to know him.

08:51.822 --> 08:54.221
Yeah.

08:54.288 --> 08:57.555
Thanks for coming, Pono.
It's the biggest day of my lif,

08:57.621 --> 08:59.423
and you being here
made it bigger.

08:59.490 --> 09:01.490
I wouldn't miss it
for anything.

09:01.557 --> 09:05.090
- [both laugh]
- Oh, Houston on the outside!

09:05.155 --> 09:07.322
- Oh, drop in, drop in.
- Whoa!

09:07.389 --> 09:11.157
- [laughing]
- Some things never change, eh?

09:11.224 --> 09:13.458
[laughing]

09:18.990 --> 09:21.292
- Pono.
- Hey.

09:21.357 --> 09:25.857
- So we hitting Sunset?
- Ah, nah.

09:25.923 --> 09:29.192
- No time for surf today.
- Rewind.

09:29.258 --> 09:32.358
I heard you just say something
crazy like no time for surfing.

09:32.424 --> 09:34.692
Yeah. Come.

09:34.759 --> 09:38.060
I wanna show you why
Carla and Chris came to Oahu.

09:46.259 --> 09:48.860
This is why
they came to Hawaii?

09:48.926 --> 09:50.227
Carla's father
owned this shop.

09:50.293 --> 09:54.760
- When he passed away,
he left it to her.
- OK.

09:54.826 --> 09:57.961
And, uh, I'm going
to help her get it going.

09:58.027 --> 10:00.427
[laughs] Wow.

10:00.495 --> 10:03.361
- You're gonna run a shop?
- Don't look so surprised, Pon.

10:05.427 --> 10:09.528
- [bell jingles]
- Ta-da! Whoo-hoo!

10:09.595 --> 10:11.896
So this is where
old surfboards go to die.

10:11.961 --> 10:14.129
- What you think, Pono?
- It's, um...

10:14.196 --> 10:17.062
- ...um... It's nice.
- [Carla] Hey.

10:17.129 --> 10:20.663
- Hey!
- The cavalry's here.
[laughs] Hey.

10:21.596 --> 10:23.029
- Hey, Johnny.
- Hey.

10:23.096 --> 10:25.663
So, uh, where's Chris?
I thought he was with you.

10:25.730 --> 10:29.297
Oh, no. He's, uh, across the
street with his, uh, friends.

10:29.363 --> 10:31.963
- [Grandpa] OK.
- [Carla] Yeah.

10:32.029 --> 10:35.163
So, Pono, I got plenty of work
for you to do around here.

10:35.230 --> 10:36.797
Whatever you need, Grandpa.

10:36.863 --> 10:41.999
- Well, um, there's one thing..
- Sure. No problem.

10:42.063 --> 10:46.365
- Thanks, eh.
- I'd love to baby-sit my uncl.

10:46.431 --> 10:48.132
[rock music plays]

11:04.032 --> 11:07.766
Oh, look, Chrissy.
Here comes the nephew.

11:07.832 --> 11:10.100
[sighs] Great.

11:15.932 --> 11:20.034
- [Johnny] Hey. How's it, brah?
- Great.

11:22.402 --> 11:25.001
- I'm Johnny.
- Jared.

11:25.067 --> 11:27.934
This is Bo,
Spidey and Rooster.

11:30.769 --> 11:32.235
I'm Val.

11:33.001 --> 11:37.535
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:37.602 --> 11:39.769
That's, um,
a dirt-board, right?

11:40.870 --> 11:42.602
Some people call it
a mountain-board.

11:42.669 --> 11:44.836
- Do you ride?
- He surfs.

11:44.903 --> 11:47.403
Wow, that's so
Hawaiian of you.

11:47.470 --> 11:48.537
You live here, right?

11:48.604 --> 11:52.738
For now, yeah.
Tomorrow, who knows?

11:53.903 --> 11:56.203
OK. I get it.

11:56.269 --> 11:59.703
You're all from the Mainland
and you all don't like surfing,

11:59.770 --> 12:03.771
and you all get your matching
outfits at Dirt Devils, huh?

12:03.839 --> 12:09.472
They bring the dirt
and I supply the devil.

12:12.139 --> 12:14.837
[laughs] Aw, man.

12:14.904 --> 12:17.405
Look, I'm kiddin', bro.

12:17.472 --> 12:21.405
Come on inside and see what
everyone's been talkin' about.

12:21.471 --> 12:23.173
Sure. Why not?

12:28.240 --> 12:30.673
Oh, this is all
state-of-the-art gear.

12:30.740 --> 12:34.874
On this side we got dirt decks,
all-terrain trucks, suspension,

12:34.941 --> 12:38.841
helmets, leathers.
Spidey, do not touch that.

12:38.907 --> 12:41.141
And over here
it's all street.

12:41.207 --> 12:44.908
You got your, uh,
custom decks, suspension...

12:44.974 --> 12:47.342
Oh, man, out the back,

12:47.408 --> 12:50.575
we do the sickest taping
this side of Carlsbad.

12:50.642 --> 12:53.575
There's nothing but the best
for my crew, huh? Am I right?

12:53.642 --> 12:54.943
- Yeah.
- Yeah, right.

12:55.009 --> 12:57.242
Yeah, this stuff is,
uh, it's pretty sweet.

12:57.308 --> 13:00.742
Yeah, well, Troy is the
godfather of dirt-boarding.

13:00.808 --> 13:03.208
He's gonna help us get sponsors
so we can do a tour.

13:03.275 --> 13:06.075
We can get off this rock and
make the world our dirt pile.

13:06.143 --> 13:08.543
- You ever ride?
- Well, I skate back in Vermon.

13:08.610 --> 13:10.475
Here, it's all
about North Shore.

13:10.543 --> 13:13.376
Well, then the answer
would be, uh, "No."

13:13.443 --> 13:15.211
Carving rock is gnarly, dude.

13:15.278 --> 13:18.210
When you stack,
you don't float.

13:18.277 --> 13:20.878
- You bleed.
- OK, I think he gets the poin.

13:20.943 --> 13:24.177
We were gonna hit some trails
we found west of Cloud Break,

13:24.245 --> 13:27.144
- so you could come with us.
- No, Johnny can't come

13:27.211 --> 13:29.912
because he has
stuff to do, right?

13:29.979 --> 13:34.579
Actually, I'd be down to give t
a try. I'll need a board.

13:34.644 --> 13:36.812
- Cool.
- Yeah.

13:36.879 --> 13:41.480
- Rental's on the house.
- And a helmet. And pads.

13:41.546 --> 13:44.713
Oh, of course.
Yeah! Safety first, right?

13:44.779 --> 13:47.179
- [all] Yeah.
- Right.

13:47.246 --> 13:48.613
Whoo-hoo!

13:50.879 --> 13:52.380
Whoa! [chuckles]

13:55.614 --> 13:57.115
Yeah!

14:02.682 --> 14:04.715
That was tough!

14:25.149 --> 14:26.451
That was crazy!

14:47.750 --> 14:49.285
I don't think we should be her.

14:51.385 --> 14:53.785
The only one who
shouldn't be here is you.

14:55.885 --> 14:59.552
These guys, they're not
your friends, are they?

14:59.619 --> 15:01.918
You need to shut up.

15:01.985 --> 15:04.086
All right? We're friends.

15:05.720 --> 15:07.519
I'm sure you'd
like them to be.

15:09.187 --> 15:11.254
You don't have the uniform.

15:11.321 --> 15:14.388
- You're not a Dirt Devil yet.
- I will be.

15:15.888 --> 15:19.488
Right. When you prove
you're good enough.

15:19.553 --> 15:20.953
So prove it.

15:51.023 --> 15:55.456
- Here.
- Whoa. Deja vu.

15:55.524 --> 15:57.823
- Yeah, are you OK?
- Yeah, no, I'm cool.

15:57.890 --> 16:00.224
Man, you can't stop
this thing like a snowboard.

16:00.291 --> 16:02.058
Brah, you are awesome!

16:02.124 --> 16:05.892
Compared to what?
Johnny "Who-nami?" [laughs]

16:08.125 --> 16:12.892
Yeah. Kid,
that was a nice try, C,

16:12.957 --> 16:16.525
but you know what you gotta do
to be one of us.

16:16.592 --> 16:20.458
You gotta impress Troy.
And to impress Troy,

16:20.524 --> 16:23.427
you gotta impress me first. OK?

16:23.494 --> 16:27.293
So I think that you
should ride the Toilet Bowl.

16:52.028 --> 16:54.729
- [Jared] Do it.
- Bail then.

16:54.794 --> 16:56.527
No shame in backing off
a sketchy run.

Hey, I got something for you.

17:34.565 --> 17:36.766
What's going on?

17:36.833 --> 17:41.432
I found these two ripping up
some private property on this.

17:41.500 --> 17:44.432
It was my idea.
I asked Chris to teach me.

17:44.500 --> 17:47.500
- I guess I chose
the wrong spot.
- What were you thinking?

17:47.567 --> 17:50.601
So, what's it gonna be,
Officer Oki?

17:50.667 --> 17:52.332
Well, this is
Chris' second warning.

17:52.400 --> 17:55.901
Next time, it's wikiwiki
to the juvie judge.

17:55.968 --> 17:58.335
Inside with me.
Come on. Right now.

18:06.468 --> 18:08.836
You know,
I would have been outta th.

18:08.902 --> 18:12.668
- Face planted
at the bottom, brah.
- Brah?

18:12.734 --> 18:15.735
Do me a favor and just stop
calling me that, all right?

18:15.803 --> 18:18.269
I'm not your brah,
your bro,

18:18.336 --> 18:20.702
or any other part
of your family.

18:28.336 --> 18:32.436
So Chris, uh, we talked about
what happened today.

18:32.503 --> 18:35.803
Johnny knows, uh, I'm not
into this punishment thing.

18:37.136 --> 18:40.637
When his dad was your age,
we disagreed.

18:40.703 --> 18:44.204
But I believed that in time
he'd find his own path.

18:44.271 --> 18:47.038
I believe in you too, Chris.

18:47.105 --> 18:52.471
This path you're on
right now... it's dangerous.

18:52.538 --> 18:56.471
So we've, um... we've decided
to take away your wheels.

18:56.538 --> 18:58.373
No more dirt-boarding
for the week.

18:58.440 --> 19:00.640
- But, Mom...
- No, no "buts."

19:00.705 --> 19:04.572
What about him?
He said that it was his idea!

19:04.640 --> 19:07.907
You know what, Chris?
I don't want to hear it, OK? G.

19:09.640 --> 19:10.974
[Chris] Great job, brah.

19:18.406 --> 19:21.840
Grandpa, I'm sorry.

19:21.906 --> 19:25.708
Yeah, well, I appreciate
what you tried to do. I do.

19:25.775 --> 19:27.675
I just wish it would've
turned out better.

19:27.741 --> 19:28.942
You OK, Grandpa?

19:31.442 --> 19:34.741
I never told you, if we
don't open the shop in time,

19:34.808 --> 19:38.710
generate some cash right away,
Carla may lose everything.

19:38.776 --> 19:41.276
Well, is there anything
that can I do?

19:44.875 --> 19:47.676
- Chris.
- I know he's kind of...

19:47.742 --> 19:50.909
Angry? Bitter?
A pain in the...?

19:50.976 --> 19:52.844
Pono, look.

19:52.911 --> 19:56.644
Please, for me, just keep him
out of trouble till Saturday.

20:01.444 --> 20:04.644
- Dude, where's your board?
- I can't go surfing.

20:04.711 --> 20:06.612
- Quick. Get in the car!
- Why?

20:06.679 --> 20:10.345
Uh, 'cause I'm taking you to te
hospital. You've gotta be sick.

20:10.412 --> 20:12.179
Uncle doesn't surf.

20:14.345 --> 20:16.980
- Chris, Sam. Sam, Chris.
- What's up, Chris?

20:17.045 --> 20:18.513
Whatever.

20:22.811 --> 20:24.346
Look, bro, all I'm saying

20:24.413 --> 20:27.212
is your grandpa doesn't
seem like the business type.

20:27.279 --> 20:30.279
He isn't. Wasn't.

20:30.346 --> 20:33.013
The place is gonna
crash and burn.

20:34.280 --> 20:37.214
Hello? Anybody here?

20:38.248 --> 20:40.515
Weird. Grandpa's car's
out front.

20:40.582 --> 20:42.781
Maybe he went to
the barbershop for a trim.

20:42.847 --> 20:45.249
[laughs] Yeah, right.

20:45.316 --> 20:47.382
- You're kidding?
- Not really.

20:49.082 --> 20:51.915
"Gone to the barbershop
for a trim."

20:51.980 --> 20:54.781
[laughs] Well,
I'm gonna go ask him

20:54.848 --> 20:56.115
to see what he
wants us to do first.

20:56.182 --> 21:00.316
- Um, keep an eye on him for m?
- Gotcha, bro.

21:00.383 --> 21:04.316
- You don't have to watch me.
- Right.

21:04.383 --> 21:06.283
[laughs]

21:12.916 --> 21:16.483
- [Grandpa] Hey, brother.
How's it?
- Sorry.

21:16.549 --> 21:19.683
- Hey, Pono!
- Grandpa?

21:19.750 --> 21:22.417
So, what you think, Pono?
Crazy, huh?

21:22.484 --> 21:24.817
Uh, yeah,
you could say that.

21:24.884 --> 21:27.485
Gonna meet Carla at the bank.
Where's Chris?

21:27.551 --> 21:30.651
- He's back at
the shop with Sam.
- Oh, late.

21:30.718 --> 21:33.552
You're wearing a watch?
You never wear a watch.

21:33.618 --> 21:36.653
Not since... Wish me luck. We'l
tell you about it later, eh?

21:37.586 --> 21:38.720
All right.

21:41.353 --> 21:44.054

- Hey.

21:56.619 --> 22:00.687
Whoa, bro. I haven't
seen that look since the...

22:00.753 --> 22:03.187
Come to think of it,
I've never seen that look.

22:03.253 --> 22:05.587

- I saw my grandpa.

22:05.654 --> 22:08.588
- Yeah, so?
- He was wearing a suit.

about something like that.

help Grandpa with this.

called. He sounded strange.

- Good. There's all this stuff

and no one surfs anymore.

'cause you always forget.

- Let's get my board
and go surf.

- Yes.

Maybe you'll get lucky
and they won't give him back.

Chris out of trouble.

- As I understand it,

he's not allowed to, uh,
dirt-board. [laughs] Come on.

24:24.266 --> 24:27.200
It's cool. Val heard
that Chris couldn't ride dirt,

24:27.267 --> 24:30.868
so I set up this little street
course on my buddy's barge.

24:35.567 --> 24:37.999
Hey, uh, Johnny?

24:38.667 --> 24:41.133
Look, I'm on Chris's side.

24:41.201 --> 24:43.500
I know how much skating
means to these kids.

24:43.567 --> 24:46.533
They really stick together.
You take Rooster, for instance.

24:46.601 --> 24:48.235
He's from Montana.
He came here.

24:48.301 --> 24:50.836
He doesn't surf,
he had no friends,

24:50.902 --> 24:53.736
then he found the Dirt Devils.
And Chris, well, I was just

24:53.803 --> 24:57.036
telling him he might be
almost ready to wear the logo.

24:57.102 --> 25:00.336
Oh, really? Did he do
something impressive?

25:00.403 --> 25:01.970

that to scare off the posers.

Chris is 12.

even know he's here.

stressing this week, you know?

Now he's pullin' this.

25:35.271 --> 25:37.271
Maybe it's his way
of dealing, bro.

moved to Vermont. All right?

- We gotta get back home.

52:03.704 --> 52:06.138
Whatever you want, I'll do it.
I'll do it now.

52:06.204 --> 52:08.804
Oh, OK. Uh...

52:08.871 --> 52:13.472
Here's what I wanna see. I wana
see you tellin' your new dad

52:13.539 --> 52:17.406
if it's a board and it has
wheels, it sells at my shop.

52:17.472 --> 52:19.440
- Period.
- Yeah. OK, man. Whatever.

52:19.505 --> 52:21.440
- Just let me ride.
- Chris, we gotta jet.

52:21.507 --> 52:24.306
- Let me go.
- Jared's my team captain.

52:24.373 --> 52:27.472
He knows what it takes to be on
this team. If he says you're i,

52:27.539 --> 52:30.074
then you get to wear
the D-squared logo.

52:30.141 --> 52:33.374
You want to be a Devil, grom?
You gotta get air. Big air.

52:33.440 --> 52:35.239
Not those baby bumps
you been ridin'.

52:35.306 --> 52:36.774
No problem.
Name the place.

52:37.574 --> 52:43.041
How about... Pupukea?

52:43.108 --> 52:45.442
The gap at the bottom
of the south trail.

52:45.509 --> 52:47.340
- When?
- Tomorrow. 3:00.

52:47.407 --> 52:48.875
Chris, come on.
Let's go.

52:52.641 --> 52:54.942
- I'm there.
- Can't wait.

52:56.242 --> 52:58.076
<i> [announcer] That's Akoni Kama.</i>

52:58.143 --> 53:01.175
<i> He'll be here
all day signing autographs.</i>

53:01.242 --> 53:03.576
He ran away
from home, John.

53:03.643 --> 53:05.376
He went to
hang with his friends,

53:05.443 --> 53:09.044
- and do what he loves.
- He took the bus! By himself!

53:09.110 --> 53:11.644
Old lady tourists
take the bus around here.

53:11.710 --> 53:14.644
That's not the point, OK?

53:23.512 --> 53:24.646
[sighs]

53:28.211 --> 53:31.612
As he gets older,
he's going to make mistakes.

53:31.677 --> 53:34.445
- He's gonna
do things he regrets.
- I know.

53:36.146 --> 53:38.047
Sometimes he'll
need his mother.

53:39.846 --> 53:43.880
But right now, what he needs
most is to be part of somethin.

53:46.012 --> 53:47.581
To belong.

53:50.780 --> 53:52.681
Ah, great.

53:58.914 --> 54:03.048
You know, they say that
if you're a pipeline surfer,

54:03.114 --> 54:07.648
you're gonna get hurt. It's
not a matter of if, or when.

54:07.715 --> 54:11.416
- It's inevitable.
- You know, as usual,

54:11.483 --> 54:14.149
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

54:25.516 --> 54:28.682
Your mom and my grandpa.

54:28.750 --> 54:31.250
They are
going to get married.

54:31.317 --> 54:35.083
Whether we like it or not,
it's gonna happen.

54:35.150 --> 54:37.451
We are gonna be a family.

54:39.217 --> 54:43.285
So all this yelling and
slamming doors, running away,

54:43.351 --> 54:46.218
it's not gonna change anything.

54:46.284 --> 54:48.751
In the meantime, you're
making everyone miserable.

54:48.818 --> 54:51.485
You know what?
You can leave me alone.

54:57.018 --> 54:59.552
You know, all I want...

55:01.119 --> 55:04.386
All I want is for
my grandpa to be happy.

55:04.452 --> 55:06.253
And I think your mom
deserves the same.

55:08.954 --> 55:11.521
She seems like a really nice
person. That's all I'm saying.

55:12.420 --> 55:14.921
Yeah, thanks.

55:14.987 --> 55:17.454
I'll always cherish this momen.

55:19.686 --> 55:21.221
Later, brah.

55:24.755 --> 55:26.389
Ooh! Oh...

55:28.088 --> 55:30.255
- [straining]
- There. No, back.

55:30.322 --> 55:31.655
- Back.
- [Grandpa] You sure?

55:31.721 --> 55:35.255
Yes. Back. That's it.

55:36.822 --> 55:38.722
Unless...

55:38.789 --> 55:40.990
You know
where we could put this?

55:42.755 --> 55:44.324
Right here.

55:44.822 --> 55:46.257
Perfect.

55:46.322 --> 55:48.923
- How's that checklist, Mel?
- Very checked, thank you.

55:48.989 --> 55:51.157
- Flowers finally came!
- Check.

55:51.224 --> 55:53.590
- Oh, music.
- Uh, check.

55:53.657 --> 55:55.856
- Thank you.
- [father] Hula dancers?

55:55.923 --> 55:59.490
- [Mel laughs] Double check.
- OK.

55:59.557 --> 56:02.891
Um, you do realize this
isn't even the actual wedding.

56:02.958 --> 56:04.758
It's just
the rehearsal dinner.

56:04.824 --> 56:07.025
Just wait till
you get married, Pono.

56:09.692 --> 56:12.492
Hey. Do I have to
worry about you today?

56:12.559 --> 56:17.860
- No. No.
- Hey. You're my boy.

56:17.925 --> 56:19.826
Kiss me.

56:19.893 --> 56:22.760
- [Grandpa] Uh, Pete?
You ready to go?
- Yeah. Shoot.

56:22.826 --> 56:24.827
- Go where?
We still need muscle.
- What?

56:24.893 --> 56:26.393
Oh, don't worry.
We'll be back.

56:26.460 --> 56:28.827
We just have a few, uh,
details to take care of.

56:28.893 --> 56:31.193
We'll be ready for the
grand opening tomorrow.

56:31.260 --> 56:36.393
Grand opening in the morning,
wedding at night. Am I crazy?

56:36.460 --> 56:38.061
A whole day
of new beginnings, Pono.

56:38.126 --> 56:40.527
- So what? You coming?
- Nah.

56:40.594 --> 56:45.262
Somebody's gotta stay behind
and... be the muscle.

56:45.329 --> 56:48.496
- Thank you.
- Don't rip your shirt, Rock.

56:48.561 --> 56:52.063
Very funny. And just
so you know, it's The Rock.

56:52.130 --> 56:54.729
OK, The Rock.
We'll see you hula time, eh?

56:54.795 --> 56:56.729
[Johnny] All right.

56:56.795 --> 56:59.530
Hey, um, come on, man.
I need some help.

56:59.596 --> 57:01.096
Come on.

57:03.130 --> 57:07.796
- All right, we'll look at...
- Hey, um, thanks.

57:07.862 --> 57:10.929
- For what?
- You know,
for not telling anyone

57:10.996 --> 57:15.563
- about the jump today.
- Oh, well, that was easy.

57:15.630 --> 57:17.230
- Really?
- Yeah.

57:17.297 --> 57:20.131
- Because there isn't
gonna be any jump.
- Says you.

57:24.831 --> 57:28.464
- What's up?
- You see those
flower arrangements?

57:28.532 --> 57:30.465
- The stupid pineapple ones?
- Yeah.

57:30.530 --> 57:32.199
My mom has spent
hours on them.

57:32.266 --> 57:35.398
My dad has set up
every chair and table here.

57:35.465 --> 57:37.965
- So?
- So for the next 24 hours,

57:38.032 --> 57:39.565
you and your
miserable little life

57:39.632 --> 57:41.465
consists of doing
whatever it takes

57:41.532 --> 57:44.632
to make this day special
for your mom and my grandpa,

57:44.699 --> 57:45.932
just like the rest of us.

57:46.000 --> 57:50.365
- Or what?
- Trust me.
You don't want to know.

57:50.432 --> 57:53.266
- Johnny?
- You win. Fine.

57:53.333 --> 57:55.134
- Good.
- I need you to go into town

57:55.201 --> 57:57.701
and pick up things from
this list. Don't forget ice.

57:57.766 --> 58:00.999
[Johnny] Yeah, sure.
No problem.

58:00.068 --> 58:04.168
- Hey, um, can I come?
- Why do you want to come?

58:04.235 --> 58:07.536
I thought I'd help you out
with the ice bags.

58:09.068 --> 58:12.168
- OK. Thanks.
- Yeah. Gotcha, bro.

58:12.235 --> 58:14.101
Just, uh,
wait for me in the car.

58:16.170 --> 58:19.003
I'm impressed.
How'd you do that?

58:19.070 --> 58:23.871
I, uh, guess I appealed to his
sense of self-preservation.

58:23.936 --> 58:26.736
OK. [laughs]
Seat belts.

58:26.802 --> 58:28.836
- All right. Bye, Mom.
- Seat belt!

58:41.637 --> 58:43.903
Hey, uh, gotta go
to the bathroom.

58:43.971 --> 58:45.737
Why didn't you go
before we left?

58:45.804 --> 58:47.873
Didn't have to go then.

58:47.938 --> 58:51.305
[sighs]
Well, all right.

58:51.371 --> 58:54.672
Just come and find me when
you're done. This list is craz.

59:31.041 --> 59:32.342
Hold that.

59:45.809 --> 59:47.411
I can't believe I fell for tha.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.569
Great. Flat tire.

59:58.601 --> 01:00:01.201
[Spidey] Yo,
that's at least 15 feet deep.

01:00:01.268 --> 01:00:03.235
[Bo] Don't fall in.

01:00:03.301 --> 01:00:05.302
It's looking pretty gnarly!

01:00:11.868 --> 01:00:14.069
[Spidey] That's your jump,
Chrissy.

01:00:20.004 --> 01:00:21.536
[Jared] Let's go.

01:00:28.471 --> 01:00:30.103
I can't believe
you fell for that.

01:00:30.170 --> 01:00:33.071
- OK, really not the point.
- You gotta admit, it's funny.

01:00:33.138 --> 01:00:35.238
Mom, dad and grandpa are
going to think it's hilarious.

01:00:35.904 --> 01:00:38.239
There they are.

01:00:38.306 --> 01:00:42.371
- Do this and I'm a Dirt Devil?
- Absolutely. It's all you, br.

01:00:44.804 --> 01:00:46.973
[Johnny] Tell me he's not
gonna try that gap.

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:49.005
- I wish I could.
- Chris, wait!

01:00:49.072 --> 01:00:50.505
Decision time, C.

01:00:50.572 --> 01:00:52.639
Better hurry. Nephew
doesn't look too stoked.

01:00:52.705 --> 01:00:54.105
[Johnny] Chris, hold up!

01:01:11.674 --> 01:01:13.873
Oh! Oh!

01:01:13.940 --> 01:01:17.074
- Chris!
- [laughs]

01:01:20.241 --> 01:01:22.507
- You all right?
- My arm! It kills.

01:01:22.574 --> 01:01:25.475
- Stay still. Just stay still.
- That was awesome, dude.

01:01:25.542 --> 01:01:27.676
Back off, all right?
I'm serious!

01:01:27.743 --> 01:01:30.042
It's cool, OK?

01:01:30.109 --> 01:01:31.877
- Does anything else hurt?
- No.

01:01:31.942 --> 01:01:36.043
- I'm gonna get help, OK?
- OK. All right, go. Thanks.

01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:39.543
- You all right?
- How could you
let this happen, Johnny?

01:01:39.609 --> 01:01:41.343
You were
keeping an eye on him.

01:01:41.409 --> 01:01:45.409
I was. He's like some
12-year-old evil genius.

01:01:45.476 --> 01:01:49.310
Johnny tried to stop Chris.
We just got there too late.

01:01:49.377 --> 01:01:52.577
You gotta give him props for
that jump. It was pretty sweet.

01:01:52.645 --> 01:01:55.012
I think we'll hold off on
the props for a little while.

01:01:58.743 --> 01:02:01.844
We're lucky. It's a simple
fracture. Nothing serious.

01:02:01.911 --> 01:02:05.212
I am so sorry
about all of this.

01:02:05.277 --> 01:02:07.245
No, I'm sorry.
I should've kept an eye on him.

01:02:07.312 --> 01:02:08.978
Sorry about your dinner...

01:02:09.045 --> 01:02:14.179
No, Johnny, please. It's OK.
Chris told us everything.

01:02:14.246 --> 01:02:16.613
- [Grandpa] Hey, Mel, Pete.
Help me clean up?
- Yeah.

01:02:16.679 --> 01:02:18.513
- Can I help?
- Yeah. Come.

01:02:34.781 --> 01:02:35.914
Does it hurt?

01:02:37.382 --> 01:02:39.349
A... little.

01:02:44.248 --> 01:02:46.380
That was a pretty
sweet jump, though.

01:02:46.447 --> 01:02:49.449
- [car approaching]
- [indistinct radio chatter]

01:02:51.817 --> 01:02:54.850
- This should be fun.
- Hey, relax.
This ain't about you.

01:02:54.917 --> 01:02:56.417
Hey, Johnny T.

01:03:00.250 --> 01:03:02.049
[Oki] I've got bad news.

01:03:02.116 --> 01:03:05.051
There was a break-in at
the store. It's been trashed.

01:03:25.152 --> 01:03:26.851
Who would do
something like this?

01:03:26.918 --> 01:03:30.252
I've got officers
canvassing the area.

01:03:30.319 --> 01:03:31.686
We'll do an investigation,

01:03:31.752 --> 01:03:34.685
see if we can find fingerprints
on that window in back.

01:03:34.752 --> 01:03:37.685
We've been here every day,
every night.

01:03:37.752 --> 01:03:40.386
Whoever did this probably
knew you'd all be busy tonight.

01:03:42.487 --> 01:03:44.221
- Jared.
- Jared.

01:03:44.286 --> 01:03:47.953
We found him behind Dirt Devils
with a key to the store room.

01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:49.888
He was stashing this.

01:03:57.420 --> 01:04:00.321
- [siren wails]
- Copy.

01:04:00.388 --> 01:04:03.121
That's affirmative,
dispatch. Over.

01:04:09.255 --> 01:04:11.190
There are three more bags
of stolen gear

01:04:11.257 --> 01:04:12.556
where we found that one.

01:04:12.623 --> 01:04:15.990
- Troy's on his way.
- Speak of the devil.

01:04:21.056 --> 01:04:22.790
Oh, this is brutal.

01:04:24.024 --> 01:04:26.190
It's not good for the opening.

01:04:26.257 --> 01:04:27.924
[Oki] You know
anything about this?

01:04:29.524 --> 01:04:31.092
Uh, no.

01:04:32.656 --> 01:04:34.957
- Hey. Put in him the car.
- Come on.

01:04:35.025 --> 01:04:37.492
- Sure we have to
call my parents?
- You're joking.

01:04:37.558 --> 01:04:40.057
Troy. We're gonna need
access to your storeroom.

01:04:40.125 --> 01:04:42.793
Oh, yeah. Absolutely.
You have my full cooperation.

01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:50.260
- Hey, John.
- Yeah, Troy.

01:04:50.326 --> 01:04:52.692
I just want to apologize
for the other day.

01:04:52.759 --> 01:04:56.692
- Ah...
- I have to admit
that I was nervous

01:04:56.759 --> 01:05:00.825
about having the legend, the
great Johnny T., as competitio.

01:05:00.893 --> 01:05:03.061
But, man,
this just makes me sick.

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:07.359
And If there's, uh,
anything I can do to help...

01:05:07.426 --> 01:05:10.361
You know, I don't think
there's much anyone can do.

01:05:12.027 --> 01:05:15.027
Well, I better go and help out.

01:05:15.094 --> 01:05:17.028
But hey, I heard about the jum.

01:05:17.694 --> 01:05:21.196
Oh, you did? Cool.

01:05:21.261 --> 01:05:23.095
It's impressive, man.

01:05:23.161 --> 01:05:25.962
Why don't you come
by the store tomorrow?

01:05:26.029 --> 01:05:27.929
I got a Dirt Devils helmet
in your size.

01:05:27.996 --> 01:05:30.362
- Sweet.
- That's not going to happen.

01:05:30.429 --> 01:05:31.930
What are you talking about?

01:05:31.996 --> 01:05:33.496
You going to ride
for these guys

01:05:33.562 --> 01:05:36.364
- after all that's happened?
- Johnny, please. Not now.

01:05:36.431 --> 01:05:38.697
Hey, Troy.

01:05:38.763 --> 01:05:42.330
- Time to go, brah.
- Oh, hey. My bad.

01:05:42.397 --> 01:05:46.098
I guess when I see real talent,
I have to go after it.

01:05:47.264 --> 01:05:50.464
But I hear ya.
Family first, right?

01:05:53.098 --> 01:05:56.230
Come on, Val, we gotta get
you home. Chris, Johnny.

01:05:56.297 --> 01:06:00.697
No. I'm not riding with him.

01:06:00.763 --> 01:06:04.732
- He ruins everything for me!
- Christopher, please.

01:06:05.766 --> 01:06:07.000
I hate this family.

01:06:17.933 --> 01:06:21.299
Dad, listen, we'll all
sort this out tomorrow.

01:06:21.366 --> 01:06:24.234
- Together, all right?
- Thanks, eh.

01:06:30.234 --> 01:06:32.668
[Carla] I don't know
what I was thinking.

01:06:33.801 --> 01:06:36.701
This place
might be paradise,

01:06:36.768 --> 01:06:39.900
but it's still real life.

01:06:39.967 --> 01:06:42.368
[Grandpa] A life
we can work on together.

01:06:42.435 --> 01:06:45.103
All this can be fixed.

01:06:46.735 --> 01:06:49.402
We'll ask the bank for an
extension on the loan...

01:06:49.469 --> 01:06:51.870
It's not the shop, John.

01:06:55.268 --> 01:06:57.370
I think I made a mistake.

01:06:58.870 --> 01:07:01.504
Staying here,

01:07:01.571 --> 01:07:04.804
thinking I could just
bring Chris with me

01:07:04.871 --> 01:07:07.271
on my little
Hawaiian adventure.

01:07:08.371 --> 01:07:11.405
And he's not luggage,
you know?

01:07:11.471 --> 01:07:14.472
- He's a boy and...
- He just needs some time.

01:07:14.538 --> 01:07:15.671
He'll come around.

01:07:17.571 --> 01:07:20.205
I can't take that risk.

01:07:24.572 --> 01:07:26.639
I just...

01:07:30.806 --> 01:07:32.974
...can't marry you, John.

01:07:34.306 --> 01:07:37.139
I'm taking Chris
back to Philly.

01:07:37.206 --> 01:07:40.373
We'll sell the shop and, um,

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:43.441
- of course
you'll get a share...
- Share?

01:07:48.475 --> 01:07:53.306
I don't want a share,
I want you.

01:07:53.373 --> 01:07:55.308
I want to be Chris's father.

01:07:55.375 --> 01:07:58.042
I've barely been his mother.

01:07:58.109 --> 01:08:00.942
I've been so wrapped up
in opening this business.

01:08:04.375 --> 01:08:08.675
Hey, you're always saying

01:08:08.741 --> 01:08:10.808
that things will work out,

01:08:10.875 --> 01:08:13.343
let nature take its course.

01:08:14.277 --> 01:08:16.743
But for the good of my son,

01:08:17.944 --> 01:08:20.111
I can't wait that long.

01:08:23.444 --> 01:08:25.044
I'm sorry.

01:09:13.813 --> 01:09:16.147
Waves look
pretty tasty today.

01:09:17.846 --> 01:09:21.448
Eh, don't feel like
getting in the water much, Pon.

01:09:33.017 --> 01:09:34.683
[Johnny] It's funny.

01:09:34.749 --> 01:09:38.549
I was getting used to the idea
of having a 12-year-old uncle.

01:09:38.616 --> 01:09:42.750
Yeah, I can't imagine
them not being here,

01:09:42.816 --> 01:09:44.417
Carla and Chris.

01:09:45.683 --> 01:09:48.116
They've become
such a huge part of me.

01:09:48.183 --> 01:09:50.283
You ever tell Chris that?

01:09:51.852 --> 01:09:54.885
Hard to face that...

01:09:54.950 --> 01:09:58.185
...whatever I say to Chris
is perhaps too late.

01:09:58.252 --> 01:10:01.951
No! No, it's not.

01:10:02.018 --> 01:10:05.352
We just need to figure out a wy
to make things pono again.

01:10:09.752 --> 01:10:13.352
You and me, all right?
It's what we're great at.

01:10:13.419 --> 01:10:15.252
It's right there
on my bedroom door.

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:21.021
- [Grandpa laughs]
- What?

01:10:22.453 --> 01:10:25.655
You're not a tadpole anymore,
eh, Pono?

01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:27.820
Not exactly.

01:10:27.887 --> 01:10:30.755
I've been too busy
to even recognize that.

01:10:32.486 --> 01:10:33.954
<i> Mahalo , Pono.</i>

01:10:40.021 --> 01:10:41.989
You know what?

01:10:42.054 --> 01:10:43.821
I know the one person
on the planet

01:10:43.888 --> 01:10:45.588
that Chris might
actually listen to.

01:10:46.955 --> 01:10:48.721
[knocking on door]

01:10:48.789 --> 01:10:51.657
You, uh, go away, please.

01:10:51.723 --> 01:10:54.623
- I'm sorry, I can't do that.
- Val!

01:10:56.856 --> 01:11:01.056
- Val, what's up?
- I need to talk to you.

01:11:01.822 --> 01:11:02.990
Why?

01:11:03.057 --> 01:11:05.191
Somebody has to keep you
from becoming a Jared.

01:11:05.257 --> 01:11:09.325
- Jared?
- Yeah.
It's Hawaiian for "loser."

01:11:09.391 --> 01:11:13.258
Chris, Johnny Kapahala is,
like, the best big brother.

01:11:13.324 --> 01:11:15.726
Or nephew or whatever
you could ever ask for.

01:11:16.525 --> 01:11:17.725
And since he came here,

01:11:17.792 --> 01:11:19.825
he's done nothing
but try to be your friend.

01:11:19.892 --> 01:11:23.791
- You don't understand...
- He learned how to
dirt-board for you.

01:11:23.857 --> 01:11:26.659
He made a fool of himself
for you. He skated the barge.

01:11:26.726 --> 01:11:28.426
He tracked you down
when you ran away.

01:11:28.493 --> 01:11:30.659
He stood up to Troy and Jared.

01:11:30.726 --> 01:11:33.493
And yesterday, when the rest
of your so-called friends

01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:36.860
didn't even care whether or not
you jumped to your death,

01:11:36.927 --> 01:11:41.494
- he tried to stop you.
- I didn't ask him
to do all that.

01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:45.694
- No. Mr. Kapahala did.
- What?

01:11:45.761 --> 01:11:49.994
Johnny's grandpa, he asked his
17-year-old grandson to spend

01:11:50.061 --> 01:11:51.862
his entire Hawaiian vacation

01:11:51.928 --> 01:11:54.561
with his 12-year-old,
soon-to-be-stepson.

01:11:54.628 --> 01:11:57.161
And Johnny did it.
I just don't get it.

01:11:57.227 --> 01:12:00.861
You've got this whole family
of people who love you.

01:12:00.928 --> 01:12:03.629
They want to be with you
and they want you to be happy.

01:12:04.795 --> 01:12:06.896
Why would you
walk away from that?

01:12:08.695 --> 01:12:09.763
[door slams]

01:12:16.262 --> 01:12:20.362
- Do you see?
- Johnny and Chris talking?

01:12:20.429 --> 01:12:24.397
- Should we be worried?
- Only if we hear police siren.

01:12:25.897 --> 01:12:28.864
[Chris] This whole thing
is my fault.

01:12:28.931 --> 01:12:31.731
If I would've listened to you
and not have gone for that jum,

01:12:31.798 --> 01:12:34.565
Jared would have never
known about the party.

01:12:35.132 --> 01:12:36.764
And...

01:12:38.665 --> 01:12:42.132
...my mom would
be opening the shop today,

01:12:42.197 --> 01:12:44.598
and she'd be marrying
your grandpa tonight.

01:12:47.932 --> 01:12:51.166
Look, I... I really
want to fix this.

01:12:52.333 --> 01:12:56.433
I just... don't know how.

01:12:56.499 --> 01:13:00.100
- You really do?
- Yeah.

01:13:00.167 --> 01:13:03.133
Then I guess it's a good thing
that your nephew's a genius.

01:13:04.901 --> 01:13:07.268
[laughs] Come with me.

01:13:09.801 --> 01:13:12.034
[Mel] Carla, what if you staye?

01:13:12.101 --> 01:13:16.868
Just... postpone the wedding,
give the shop a chance. I...

01:13:16.935 --> 01:13:21.435
- Give Dad some time with Chri.
- No, it's complicated.

01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:24.235
Well, of course it is.

01:13:24.302 --> 01:13:27.169
I just...
I want you to know

01:13:27.235 --> 01:13:30.536
we'll all be really sad
if you leave.

01:13:30.602 --> 01:13:32.136
I mean, what's a
Hawaiian vacation

01:13:32.203 --> 01:13:34.036
without some police
intervention

01:13:34.102 --> 01:13:36.837
and a couple trips
to the emergency room?

01:13:36.902 --> 01:13:38.969
[laughs] Hopefully,
we'll outgrow that.

01:13:39.036 --> 01:13:41.503
- Exactly.
- Well, we got most

01:13:41.570 --> 01:13:44.037
of the restaurant deposit back
for the reception.

01:13:44.105 --> 01:13:46.338
We do, however,
have to eat there tonight

01:13:46.405 --> 01:13:48.804
and order the entire
right side of the menu.

01:13:48.870 --> 01:13:50.038
[phone rings]

01:13:51.904 --> 01:13:55.804
Hello? Yeah. OK.

01:13:55.871 --> 01:13:57.239
All right.

01:13:58.637 --> 01:13:59.770
That was Johnny.

01:13:59.838 --> 01:14:02.170
- What's up?
- He's at the store with Chris.

01:14:02.237 --> 01:14:03.740
Well, is Chris OK?

01:14:09.106 --> 01:14:11.972
Chris? Open up.
It's locked.

01:14:12.039 --> 01:14:13.306
Pono!

01:14:16.839 --> 01:14:19.306
[Grandpa chuckles]

01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:23.141
[Mel] This is incredible! Oh!

01:14:23.208 --> 01:14:25.841
- [Grandpa] Unreal, eh?
- Look at that.

01:14:25.908 --> 01:14:27.775
- [gasps]
- [laughs]

01:14:30.708 --> 01:14:35.508
- Surprise!
- Chris! Did you do this?

01:14:35.574 --> 01:14:38.107
Yep. Me and my friends.

01:14:38.174 --> 01:14:40.174
- Oh, my...
- [Johnny] We debated.

01:14:40.241 --> 01:14:43.842
Fix up the shop or do something
dangerous and/or illegal.

01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:46.042
- We settled on this.
- Good choice.

01:14:46.109 --> 01:14:49.075
- You no need do that, Pono.
- Yes. Yes, we did.

01:14:49.142 --> 01:14:50.442
Yeah.

01:14:50.509 --> 01:14:52.676
- Hey, uh, you know Val, right?
- Mom.

01:14:52.743 --> 01:14:55.575
- Hey, Val.
- She's really bossy.

01:14:55.642 --> 01:14:57.944
I am. But in a good way.

01:14:58.009 --> 01:15:01.210
Mom, I don't want to move...

01:15:02.276 --> 01:15:04.277
...yet.

01:15:04.343 --> 01:15:06.509
You know, I think
I could like it here.

01:15:06.576 --> 01:15:10.311
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:15:10.378 --> 01:15:13.911
Oh, sweetheart.
I love you.

01:15:31.445 --> 01:15:34.812
- What do you think about thes?
- [girl] I like that one.

01:15:34.879 --> 01:15:37.812
- I want you to see this.
- [girl] Oh, cool.

01:15:37.879 --> 01:15:39.445
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:15:39.512 --> 01:15:42.112
OK, put it there.

01:15:42.179 --> 01:15:44.579
No, no, no, don't do that.

01:15:44.646 --> 01:15:48.580
How 'bout over here?
Around this corner.

01:15:48.646 --> 01:15:51.314
Hang on, I think there's...
over here. It's perfect.

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:54.214
Can you just put it here? Grea.

01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:57.014
Let me think...

01:15:57.081 --> 01:15:59.882
Sam! Sam!

01:16:01.815 --> 01:16:04.650
- She's just like my mom.
- [Val] Sam!

01:16:08.449 --> 01:16:11.450
- What, bro? She scares me.
- Listen, listen, listen.

01:16:11.517 --> 01:16:13.650
- Hey! Look...
- When my buyer backed out,

01:16:13.717 --> 01:16:15.549
you said you'd step in.

01:16:15.616 --> 01:16:17.083
You come all this way
to tell me...

01:16:17.150 --> 01:16:18.750
What's going on?

01:16:18.816 --> 01:16:20.350
- My life is riding
on this deal.
- Gee.

01:16:20.415 --> 01:16:22.484
It was great not
doing business with you.

01:16:22.549 --> 01:16:24.917
- Look. Listen, all right, man.
- Uh-oh.

01:16:24.984 --> 01:16:27.217
[Troy] Can't do this.
We had a verbal contract.

01:16:27.284 --> 01:16:29.984
[Mr. Clark] Negotiating.
Our negotiations broke down.

01:16:30.051 --> 01:16:33.750
- [Troy] No, they didn't, man.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:16:33.817 --> 01:16:37.084
- What's up?
- Troy here was hoping
I'd buy his shop

01:16:37.151 --> 01:16:39.819
as a site for my
new condo development.

01:16:39.884 --> 01:16:42.151
- Condos?
- It appears as if your mentor

01:16:42.218 --> 01:16:45.052
- is moving to California.
- [Chris] Wait.

01:16:45.119 --> 01:16:46.485
What about the Dirt Devils?

01:16:46.552 --> 01:16:49.486
Troy, you said that
I could be on your crew.

01:16:49.553 --> 01:16:52.520
- This isn't about you, C.
- No, actually, it is.

01:16:52.587 --> 01:16:56.087
It's about all these kids,
including my daughter.

01:16:56.154 --> 01:16:59.986
Wait, she's... No.
I had no idea.

01:17:00.053 --> 01:17:02.985
Oh, you're surprised?
Now you know how we feel.

01:17:03.053 --> 01:17:06.821
Val, all right, this is
business. You don't understand.

01:17:06.887 --> 01:17:10.853
I do understand. I understand
you don't even care about us.

01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:13.087
You were gonna move
and leave us in the dust.

01:17:13.154 --> 01:17:15.087
So I told my dad
that we don't need

01:17:15.154 --> 01:17:18.089
any more condos on the island.
We don't need Troy's shop.

01:17:18.155 --> 01:17:20.022
There's a new
board store in town.

01:17:20.088 --> 01:17:22.989
One that cares about the sport,
not just the money.

01:17:23.056 --> 01:17:26.490
[laughs] Oh, this is... This is
really funny. Man, this is goo.

01:17:26.556 --> 01:17:28.289
I mean, you've got,
like, what?

01:17:28.356 --> 01:17:30.556
You've got five
mountain boards over there?

01:17:30.621 --> 01:17:33.556
No real rider is
gonna give you a second look.

01:17:33.623 --> 01:17:36.656
- Johnny T!
- Hey, Akoni! How is it?

01:17:36.722 --> 01:17:39.389
- Where you want these?
- That's Akoni Kama! Akoni!

01:17:39.456 --> 01:17:41.656
How you guys doing?
Hey, man. Check it out.

01:17:41.723 --> 01:17:44.156
- Akoni Kama!
- This is so cool.

01:17:44.223 --> 01:17:45.824
You do what you
have to, Johnny T.

01:17:45.891 --> 01:17:48.257
You have your little
moment in the sun.

01:17:48.324 --> 01:17:50.258
Once Akoni Kama
goes back to the Mainland

01:17:50.324 --> 01:17:51.892
and his signed boards
are gone,

01:17:51.958 --> 01:17:54.391
those kids are going
to be back riding for me,

01:17:54.458 --> 01:17:58.459
'cause I'm the real deal.
I'm going to crush you, old ma.

01:17:58.525 --> 01:18:02.526
I'm gonna make sure that
you lose your whole place
and everything in it.

01:18:08.392 --> 01:18:12.226
- It's never gonna stop, is it?
- Doesn't seem like it, Pono.

01:18:12.293 --> 01:18:13.960
Hey, Troy.

01:18:14.026 --> 01:18:16.192
I thought you were the
godfather of dirt-boarding.

01:18:19.127 --> 01:18:23.026
I just realized
I've never seen you ride.

01:18:23.093 --> 01:18:26.360
Uh, you got a point,
surfer boy?

01:18:26.428 --> 01:18:29.561
It's sort of a tradition
in our family.

01:18:29.628 --> 01:18:32.527
We settle things with
our skills, not our mouths.

01:18:34.794 --> 01:18:38.328
- What did you have in mind?
- [Grandpa] Mountain-board rac.

01:18:38.396 --> 01:18:41.295
You win, we take the
four-wheel boards out,

01:18:41.361 --> 01:18:43.295
drop 'em here
at your doorstep.

01:18:43.361 --> 01:18:45.228
You get all the
dirt gear you want.

01:18:45.295 --> 01:18:48.230
I win, both stores
sell what they want.

01:18:48.295 --> 01:18:50.228
These guys get a choice.

01:18:50.295 --> 01:18:54.062
[laughs] You can't be serious.

01:18:54.128 --> 01:18:56.696
- Dad, are you sure about this?
- Yeah. I'm sure.

01:18:56.763 --> 01:19:00.530
- I got faith in my grandson.
- Well, that's fine with me.

01:19:00.597 --> 01:19:01.963
You bring it.

01:19:04.496 --> 01:19:07.463
And what do you know.
I've got just the spot

01:19:07.530 --> 01:19:10.432
to hold this
little race, don't we?

01:19:10.498 --> 01:19:14.299
You remember how I told you
my dad likes to own things?

01:19:20.598 --> 01:19:22.333
Yeah! All right!

01:19:27.799 --> 01:19:31.565
- Daddy, this is fantastic!
- Well, it was John's idea,
actually.

01:19:31.633 --> 01:19:34.066
He wanted someplace safe
for kids to dirt-board.

01:19:34.133 --> 01:19:35.467
I made contacts,

01:19:35.534 --> 01:19:38.232
but his vision got the bank
to fund the development.

01:19:38.299 --> 01:19:39.799
I thought I was
your partner.

01:19:39.866 --> 01:19:42.299
- Ah, it was a secret.
- He did this for you.

01:19:42.366 --> 01:19:44.200
You're one lucky young man.

01:19:44.267 --> 01:19:47.368
When Johnny was little, he had
the whole ocean to do his thin.

01:19:47.435 --> 01:19:50.133
I thought you needed a place
to do what you love.

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:53.034
- Here's where you say,
"Thank you."
- Oh, got it. Thanks.

01:19:53.101 --> 01:19:54.935
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:19:55.002 --> 01:19:57.901
- You really are
a great dad, Dad.
- Thanks.

01:19:57.968 --> 01:20:00.136
Come on!
Let's scope out the track.

01:20:02.002 --> 01:20:03.468
Race you!

01:20:04.435 --> 01:20:06.535
Whoo!

01:20:08.468 --> 01:20:10.936
It's another mountain,
eh, Pono?

01:20:13.236 --> 01:20:15.671
How do we keep on
getting ourselves into this?

01:20:15.736 --> 01:20:19.602
The Kapahala way,
that's what. [laughs]

01:20:19.669 --> 01:20:23.569
- You're not nervous, are you?
- No. Why would I be nervous?

01:20:25.003 --> 01:20:26.737
No pressure at all,
right?

01:20:28.804 --> 01:20:30.771
Remember when you was a kid,

01:20:30.838 --> 01:20:33.737
you asked me who the
best surfer in the world was?

01:20:35.304 --> 01:20:37.905
And you told me the one
who's having the most fun.

01:20:37.971 --> 01:20:39.772
That's the one!

01:20:42.705 --> 01:20:44.538
<i> Mahalo , Grandp.</i>

01:20:53.606 --> 01:20:57.241
- [Sam] Yo, J, you ready?
- You know it.

01:20:59.873 --> 01:21:01.973
Hey, bro, listen.
Stay frosty, all right, man?

01:21:02.039 --> 01:21:03.439
Stay frosty.
You got this.

01:21:03.507 --> 01:21:06.507
- It's dirt-boarding.
- Oh, yeah.

01:21:06.574 --> 01:21:10.008
[laughs] I'm just playing, man.
Hey, stay dusty, man.

01:21:10.074 --> 01:21:12.241
- Stay dusty, all right.
Troy who?
- [laughs]

01:21:12.307 --> 01:21:15.542
Hey, OK, guys. OK. I, uh,
scoped out the whole course.

01:21:15.609 --> 01:21:17.708
Remember up at the top
there's a wall ride.

01:21:17.775 --> 01:21:20.042
Uh, the tree barrel
and the right hand berm.

01:21:20.109 --> 01:21:21.975
- Right.
- When you come out of that,

01:21:22.042 --> 01:21:24.343
keep your speed 'cause
of the crazy water feature.

01:21:24.409 --> 01:21:26.743
- Then...
- Scrub speed for rollers...

01:21:26.808 --> 01:21:29.141
And then you hit the
three big tabletops jumps.

01:21:29.209 --> 01:21:31.709
- Right.
- All right. Cool.

01:21:31.776 --> 01:21:35.777
Oh, and, uh, Johnny?
Be careful.

01:21:38.076 --> 01:21:40.709
Hey. Thanks, man.

01:21:40.776 --> 01:21:43.243
Listen, you're the one
that should be racing Troy.

01:21:43.310 --> 01:21:44.343
You're better than me.

01:21:44.410 --> 01:21:47.078
Dude, it's just a snowboard...

01:21:48.343 --> 01:21:50.011
...on wheels.

01:21:51.377 --> 01:21:53.477
All right. Good luck.

01:21:55.146 --> 01:21:58.212
Hey, since it's a race, I don't
have to know how to stop anywa.

01:21:58.279 --> 01:22:00.411
- [laughing]
- Hey, where you going?

01:22:00.478 --> 01:22:03.544
I'm gonna make sure that the
ambulance has the motor runnin.

01:22:03.611 --> 01:22:06.612
Yeah. Thanks, but you think
you could drop the gate for me?

01:22:06.678 --> 01:22:09.145
Yeah, come on.
Of course.

01:22:09.213 --> 01:22:11.679
Oh, you're in
way over your head.

01:22:14.813 --> 01:22:16.112
Maybe.

01:22:17.445 --> 01:22:20.613
But, hey, at least
I know how to swim.

01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:25.813
[laughs]

01:22:27.080 --> 01:22:29.246
All right, check it out.
Here are the rules.

01:22:29.313 --> 01:22:32.447
Get to the finish, three jumps,
three tricks to win. All right?

01:22:32.514 --> 01:22:36.248
Now the winner has to nail
three tricks before the finish.

01:22:36.315 --> 01:22:38.882
Cool? All right.

01:22:49.981 --> 01:22:51.382
[Sam] Riders ready...

01:22:55.415 --> 01:22:56.717
...set...

01:25:27.530 --> 01:25:29.129
[cheering]

01:25:42.731 --> 01:25:46.197
- [cheering]
- [laughing]

01:25:49.330 --> 01:25:50.498
Man!

01:26:11.566 --> 01:26:14.033
[cheering]

01:26:20.101 --> 01:26:22.201
[cheering]

01:26:34.801 --> 01:26:36.535
Come on, J!

01:26:40.102 --> 01:26:42.469
Come on! Come on, Johnny!

01:26:50.468 --> 01:26:53.736
[grunts, groaning]

01:27:09.137 --> 01:27:12.104
[cheering]

01:27:12.170 --> 01:27:15.237
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

01:27:24.373 --> 01:27:26.072
[gasping]

01:27:31.271 --> 01:27:33.206
- Johnny!
- Pono!

01:27:38.106 --> 01:27:40.507
You all right, Pono?
Say something.

01:27:42.406 --> 01:27:46.274
- That was sweet.
- [laughs]

01:27:46.341 --> 01:27:49.874
- [grunting]
- Nice.

01:27:49.941 --> 01:27:52.474
The Kapahala way.

01:27:52.540 --> 01:27:54.607
- [laughter]
- Whoo!

01:27:54.674 --> 01:27:57.975
- Yeah!
- [cheering]

01:27:58.042 --> 01:28:00.008
Congratulations!

01:28:01.941 --> 01:28:04.475
- That was nice.
- Man!

01:28:04.542 --> 01:28:08.642
- [Chris] Sweet, man.
- [Carla] That was so great.
My gosh!

01:28:15.176 --> 01:28:19.776
- You know, this isn't over.
- [Oki] Yes, it is.

01:28:19.843 --> 01:28:22.144
Shouldn't you be watching
Jared or something?

01:28:22.210 --> 01:28:23.976
I can see Jared.
He's right there.

01:28:24.044 --> 01:28:26.943
See, Jared's been released
to the custody of his parents.

01:28:27.009 --> 01:28:29.776
- It's you we wanna talk to.
- You got nothing on me.

01:28:29.843 --> 01:28:33.111
The night of the break-in,
you heard about Chris's jump.

01:28:33.178 --> 01:28:35.744
The only way you could've
is if you talked to Jared.

01:28:35.811 --> 01:28:37.545
He gave us
a full confession.

01:28:37.611 --> 01:28:39.911
Told us all about your
little powwow that night.

01:28:39.978 --> 01:28:42.344
So I figure,
aiding and abetting,

01:28:42.411 --> 01:28:44.811
coercion of juvenile
to commit a felony.

01:28:44.878 --> 01:28:47.945
- Hey, Oki...
- Don't talk, Troy.

01:28:48.012 --> 01:28:49.612
Your attorney probably
wouldn't like it.

01:28:50.812 --> 01:28:52.312
[Rooster] Hey, Chris.

01:28:54.047 --> 01:28:56.281
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:28:56.347 --> 01:29:00.112
- Cool park.
- Yeah. Good race.

01:29:00.179 --> 01:29:03.880
- Thanks, man.
- So, you wanna try it out?

01:29:03.947 --> 01:29:07.248
- Sure. Yeah.
- Let's go.

01:29:07.313 --> 01:29:08.614
I just want to go home,

01:29:08.681 --> 01:29:10.248
put my feet up and look out
at the ocean for a while.

01:29:10.313 --> 01:29:11.847
Oh, I'm right behind you.

01:29:13.347 --> 01:29:16.747
Well, we might have to put the
hammock time on a little hold.

01:29:16.815 --> 01:29:19.682
- Oh, now what?
- You know, I was just thinkin.

01:29:19.749 --> 01:29:23.949
It would be such a shame
to let that beautiful dress
to go to waste.

01:29:25.216 --> 01:29:27.682
Ta-da!

01:29:27.749 --> 01:29:30.916
[Mel] Oh! Oh, my gosh!

01:29:30.982 --> 01:29:33.682
- [Grandpa] Close one, eh?
- Congratulations, Dad.

01:29:33.749 --> 01:29:37.882
- I'm really happy for you.
- Thanks.

01:29:37.949 --> 01:29:40.984
[man] I now pronounce you
man and wife.

01:29:41.049 --> 01:29:44.284
John Kapahala,
you may kiss your bride.

01:29:44.351 --> 01:29:46.917
[speaks Hawaiian]

01:29:46.984 --> 01:29:50.485
- [Hawaiian music plays]
- [applause]

01:30:37.155 --> 01:30:40.121
- [Grandpa] Whee!
- Yeah.

01:30:40.187 --> 01:30:42.955
So, you ready
to give that a try soon?

01:30:43.022 --> 01:30:46.422
Whatever, whatever.
Surfing's no big deal.

01:30:46.490 --> 01:30:49.223
No big deal? Did he
just say no big deal?

01:30:49.289 --> 01:30:51.556
- I think he did.
- No!

01:30:51.623 --> 01:30:53.956
- Whee!
- [Chris laughs]

01:30:54.022 --> 01:30:58.024
- Here it comes! Here it comes!
- Whoo!

01:31:01.524 --> 01:31:03.089
You guys
were gonna throw me in.

01:31:03.156 --> 01:31:04.790
Yeah, and
you were scared.

01:31:04.857 --> 01:31:06.656
Ooh, yeah.
Scared. For sure.

01:31:06.723 --> 01:31:09.524
No, no, no. I saw your eyes.
I saw fear in your eyes...
