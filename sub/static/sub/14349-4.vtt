- Right, sir.

01:14.400 --> 01:16.868
All life systems were off, sir.

01:17.720 --> 01:21.508
- Someone strangled this woman.
- The other four are back there.

01:21.680 --> 01:23.193
- Dead?
- Right.

01:23.360 --> 01:27.353
- Engineer at his post?
- He's frozen there like he didn't care.

01:27.520 --> 01:29.875
The rest?

01:30.040 --> 01:32.508
Better look for yourself, Mr Spock.

01:32.680 --> 01:35.911
One man was taking a shower
fully clothed.

02:45.720 --> 02:48.359
Be certain we expose
ourselves to nothing.

02:48.520 --> 02:51.080
- Do you read?
- 'Kirk, affirmative.'

02:51.240 --> 02:53.196
All station personnel are dead.

02:53.360 --> 02:55.920
- 'What caused it?'
- Unknown, Captain.

Mr Spock l'll meet him in ten minutes.

You're fine, Joe. Up and out of there.

04:59.640 --> 05:01.596
Mr Spock.

05:08.280 --> 05:11.590
Your pulse is 242.

05:11.760 --> 05:15.548
Your blood pressure
is practically non-existent.

05:15.720 --> 05:19.633
Assuming you call
that green stuff in your veins "blood".

05:19.800 --> 05:22.030
The readings are normal for me, Doctor.

05:22.200 --> 05:26.876
As for my anatomy being different
from yours, l am delighted.

05:30.000 --> 05:30.955
Captain.

05:31.120 --> 05:33.588
- How are they?
- Fine.

05:33.760 --> 05:35.910
Terrible, Captain. lt was terrible.

05:36.080 --> 05:41.598
They were just sitting...like they didn't
care. About whatever was happening.

05:41.760 --> 05:43.398
l keep wondering...

05:43.560 --> 05:46.552
You wonder if man
was meant to be out here.

05:46.720 --> 05:49.518
You keep wondering,
and we keep signing on.

05:51.080 --> 05:53.548
Any guesses
what happened down there?

05:53.720 --> 05:56.917
l wish l could say.
Circumstances were bizarre.

05:57.080 --> 05:59.833
However our record tapes
may show us something.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.389
Six dead, six people dead.

06:03.360 --> 06:05.476
- You'd better rest.
-Yes, sir.

06:05.640 --> 06:09.633
Set up those tapes, Mr Spock.
We'll see if the answers are there.

06:13.440 --> 06:16.796
- The lab status report.
- Thank you, Christine.

06:24.480 --> 06:26.835
- Next tape.
- Spectral analysis tape.

06:27.000 --> 06:27.955
Thank you.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.635
As though they were irrational, drugged.

06:40.800 --> 06:43.872
An engineer sitting there,
oblivious to everything.

06:44.040 --> 06:45.996
A crewman with a phaser pistol.

06:46.160 --> 06:49.118
He used the computer room
as an amusement gallery.

06:49.280 --> 06:52.033
A fully clothed man frozen to death
in a shower.

06:52.200 --> 06:57.479
lf the image wasn't so ugly,
it'd be laughable. Not even a theory?

06:57.640 --> 07:02.953
Definitely not drugs or intoxication.
Bio-analysis on the tapes prove that.

07:03.120 --> 07:07.591
lt could be a form of space madness.
But it had to be caused by something.

07:07.760 --> 07:11.833
Our readings showed no contamination,
no unusual elements present.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.991
None your tricorders registered.

07:14.160 --> 07:17.436
lnstruments register
what they are designed to.

07:17.600 --> 07:20.160
Space still contains infinite unknowns.

07:20.320 --> 07:23.517
Earth science needs close
measurement of the break-up.

07:23.680 --> 07:27.798
To do this we need the Enterprise
in a critically tight orbit.

07:27.960 --> 07:32.988
Could what happened there create any
unusual danger to this vessel or crew?

07:36.040 --> 07:39.112
We will need top efficiency.
lt'll be a tricky orbit.

07:39.280 --> 07:45.628
When a planet goes there may be
changes in gravity, mass, magnetic field.

07:45.800 --> 07:50.669
The purpose of a briefing is to get me
answers based on your experience.

07:50.840 --> 07:53.559
ln a critical orbit
there's no time for surprise.

07:53.720 --> 07:57.156
Unless you start taking
showers with your clothes on,

07:57.320 --> 07:59.629
my engines can pull us out of anything.

07:59.800 --> 08:02.792
We'll be warping out of orbit
within a half second.

- Kirk here.

08:10.080 --> 08:12.355
'A change in mass also, sir.'

08:12.520 --> 08:15.318
lt's beginning, unusually rapid shifts.

08:16.560 --> 08:20.314
On our way, Lieutenant.
l'll hold you to that half second, Scotty.

08:50.920 --> 08:56.472
- Foil. lt's a rapier, a thin sword.
- All right, so what do you do with it?

08:56.640 --> 09:02.317
- What do you mean, what do you do?
- Self defence? Mayhem? Shish kebab?

09:02.480 --> 09:05.119
- You practice.
- For what?

09:05.280 --> 09:07.555
Hi, Joe.

09:07.720 --> 09:11.156
Last week it was botany
he was trying to get me interested in.

09:11.320 --> 09:15.199
- l was supposed to collect leaves.
- Your attitude is wrong.

09:15.360 --> 09:19.558
Fencing tones the muscle,
sharpens the eye, improves posture.

09:19.720 --> 09:22.075
You tell him, Joe. Explain to him.

09:24.240 --> 09:26.231
Hey, Joe.

09:26.400 --> 09:29.472
- Are you feeling all right?
- Get off me.

09:29.640 --> 09:33.428
You don't rank me and you don't have
pointed ears so get off my neck.

09:33.600 --> 09:36.194
- What's with him?
- Nothing.

You're sure you're all right?
We've got to leave.

09:50.960 --> 09:56.478
We're hypocrites, sticking our noses into
something that we've got no business.

09:56.640 --> 10:00.155
- What are we doing out here, anyway?
- Take it easy, Joe.

10:01.640 --> 10:04.108
We bring pain and trouble with us.

10:04.280 --> 10:07.750
Leave men and women stuck
on freezing planets until they die.

10:07.920 --> 10:13.199
What are we doing out here in space?
Good? What good?

10:13.360 --> 10:18.434
We're polluting it. Destroying it.
We've got no business being out here.

10:18.600 --> 10:21.034
- Take it easy.
- Calm down.

10:21.200 --> 10:23.270
lf a man was to fly, he'd have wings.

10:23.440 --> 10:26.273
lf he was to be in space,
he wouldn't need air.

10:26.440 --> 10:29.238
He wouldn't need life support systems.

10:29.400 --> 10:32.551
- Put the knife down.
- You're all steamed up, Joe.

10:32.720 --> 10:35.075
We don't belong here.

10:35.240 --> 10:38.391
lt's...it's not ours.

10:38.560 --> 10:41.233
Destroying and watching?

10:43.280 --> 10:45.271
We don't belong.

10:45.440 --> 10:47.476
l don't belong.

10:47.640 --> 10:52.714
Six people died down there.
Why do l deserve to live?

10:54.000 --> 10:56.309
- What are you doing?
- Put the knife down!

10:56.480 --> 10:58.152
- Don't be a fool.
- Look, Joe...

10:58.320 --> 11:01.278
- Let go!
- Joe, let me have the knife!

11:05.640 --> 11:07.596
Joey.

11:09.120 --> 11:11.076
Joe, give me the knife.

11:21.600 --> 11:24.831

- Compensate.

Magnetic field continues to shift, sir.
Planet continues to shrink in mass.

- Mr Spock?
- All scanning stations functioning.

12:01.920 --> 12:04.070
Orbit steady now.

12:05.200 --> 12:09.751
Obviously this planet is condensing
more rapidly than expected.

12:09.920 --> 12:13.799
A valuable study.
We may be seeing Earth's distant future.

12:14.720 --> 12:18.554
Before its sun went dark,
this planet was similar to yours.

12:18.720 --> 12:21.359
- Helm answering nicely, Captain.
- Good.

12:28.640 --> 12:30.915
Communication studies, Captain.

12:40.720 --> 12:44.235
- Tormolen's record?
- Psychiatric file, personality quotients.

12:44.400 --> 12:47.358
- Was he trying to kill himself?
- lt's doubtful.

12:47.520 --> 12:49.750
He was confused. Self-tortured.

12:49.920 --> 12:52.070
Doesn't sound like the man l know.

12:52.240 --> 12:55.232
His capacity for self-doubt
has always been high.

12:55.400 --> 12:59.518
What puzzles me is what brought it
to the surface with so much force.

13:29.400 --> 13:34.599
- His breathing rate is dropping.
- Compensate with the respirator.

13:43.840 --> 13:46.115
Stand by to close.

13:54.720 --> 13:56.676
Closing.

14:07.560 --> 14:09.790
- What is it?
- Gravity increase, sir.

14:09.960 --> 14:12.758
- Like the planet's yanked at us.
- Compensate.

14:18.720 --> 14:20.790
Compensate.

14:22.840 --> 14:26.037
Orbit steady now.
l may be a little nervous, l guess.

14:29.240 --> 14:31.549
(McCoy) This shouldn't be happening.

14:33.120 --> 14:35.236
This man should be getting stronger.

14:36.880 --> 14:39.758
- Sure the respirator is functioning?
- Yes.

14:41.680 --> 14:43.796
Why is this man dying?

14:47.720 --> 14:49.676
Hypo.

15:08.960 --> 15:14.273
- He's dead, Doctor.
- The wounds were not that severe.

15:20.480 --> 15:23.438
'This is McCoy. Captain Kirk to sickbay.'

15:23.600 --> 15:26.672
- Tell McCoy l'll be there when l can.
- Yes, sir.

15:26.840 --> 15:31.834
Planet break-up is imminent, Captain.
Shrinking in size at an increasing rate.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.913
As the planet shrinks,
its surface moves away from us.

15:36.080 --> 15:38.799
Forcing us to spiral down
to maintain distance.

15:38.960 --> 15:43.750
Exactly. We must be prepared to
respond instantly to any sudden change.

15:45.560 --> 15:47.710
- Engine room.
- 'Scott here.'

15:47.880 --> 15:50.713
Tie into the helm.
We may call for power, fast.

15:50.880 --> 15:52.836
'No problem, sir. You'll have it.'

15:53.000 --> 15:56.310
- Rate of compaction constant.
- l'll go to see the doctor.

15:56.480 --> 15:59.711
- Keep me informed.
- Acknowledged.

16:02.680 --> 16:06.832
l don't know if it's this planet
or what happened with Joe.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.560
l'm sweating like a bridegroom.

16:09.720 --> 16:11.676
Me too.

16:14.280 --> 16:17.875
Hey, why don't you come
to the gym with me?

16:18.040 --> 16:21.350
- Now?
- A light work-out will take the edge off.

16:21.520 --> 16:25.638
Sulu, what about...
Hey, Sulu. Don't be a fool.

16:35.640 --> 16:39.189
lntestinal damage wasn't that severe.

16:40.240 --> 16:44.631
l got to him in plenty of time.
That man should still be alive.

16:44.800 --> 16:47.837
The reason he died is
he didn't want to live. Gave up.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.231
- That's a supposition, not a fact.
- Well, that may be.

16:51.400 --> 16:54.153
l've lost patients before but not like that.

16:54.320 --> 16:57.710
Not Joe's kind.
That kind of man doesn't give up.

17:01.320 --> 17:05.996
Coincidence? Maybe...

17:06.160 --> 17:09.914
Joe was on the planet and you're
going to ask me if it is connected?

17:10.079 --> 17:12.674
That's exactly what l was going to ask.

17:12.839 --> 17:17.867
He was decontaminated, medically
checked. We've run every test we...

17:18.040 --> 17:20.998
- Not good enough!
- We're doing everything possible.

17:21.160 --> 17:24.357
Bones, l want the impossible
checked out, too.

17:32.760 --> 17:36.958
- Why isn't Sulu at his station?
- Pull compensated, orbit steady.

17:37.120 --> 17:39.395
- Take over here, Rand.
- Yes, sir.

17:40.360 --> 17:44.114
You haven't answered my question.
Where is Mr Sulu?

17:44.280 --> 17:46.350
Have no fear, O'Riley's here.

17:46.520 --> 17:50.433
- One lrishman is worth 10,000...
- You're relieved, Mr Riley.

17:50.600 --> 17:53.034
- Lieutenant Uhura, take over.
- Yes, sir.

17:53.200 --> 17:58.354
Now that's what l like! Let the women
work, too. Universal suffrage!

17:58.520 --> 18:03.594
- Report to sickbay, Mr Riley.
- Sickbay? Exactly where l was heading.

18:03.760 --> 18:05.716
Sir.

18:06.760 --> 18:10.514
Security, Mr Riley is heading
for sickbay. See to it he arrives.

18:10.680 --> 18:12.432
Captain Kirk to the bridge.

18:47.840 --> 18:50.877
- Where's Joe?
- Well...

18:51.040 --> 18:54.510
- He died, didn't he?
- Yes.

18:55.360 --> 18:57.476
Do you know something?

18:57.640 --> 19:03.078
You have such lovely eyes, pretty lady.

19:06.440 --> 19:09.477
l know he was a friend of yours,
this must be a shock.

19:12.360 --> 19:15.750
You know what Joe's mistake was?

19:15.920 --> 19:18.673
He wasn't born an lrishman.

19:41.960 --> 19:43.916
Richelieu, beware!

20:09.600 --> 20:12.478
Stand. No farther.

20:14.480 --> 20:16.436
(Laughs wickedly)

20:17.720 --> 20:19.597
No escape for you.

20:19.760 --> 20:26.029
You either leave this <i>bois</i> bloodied
or with my blood on your swords.

20:29.440 --> 20:31.396
(Laughs hysterically)

20:33.920 --> 20:35.876
Cowards!

20:36.040 --> 20:38.998
- Lieutenant Brent, relieve Miss Uhura.
- Yes, sir.

20:41.880 --> 20:45.316
- What were their symptoms?
- Non-violent at this stage.

20:45.480 --> 20:48.756
Riley seemed pleased with himself,
as if he were...

20:48.920 --> 20:51.798
lrrational...or drugged.

20:51.960 --> 20:55.430
- Precisely.
- Security, Lieutenant Uhura.

20:55.600 --> 21:00.230
Confine Sulu and Riley. l want every
crewman in contact with them checked.

21:00.400 --> 21:03.915
Sir, level 2, corridor 3
reports a disturbance.

21:04.080 --> 21:08.596
Mr Sulu chasing crewmen...with a sword.

21:09.760 --> 21:13.070
- Put security on him.
- A pattern is developing.

21:13.240 --> 21:17.870
First Tormolen, hidden personality traits
being forced to the surface.

21:18.040 --> 21:21.555
Then Riley, who fancies himself
a descendent of lrish kings.

21:21.720 --> 21:25.679
Now Sulu, who is at heart, a
swashbuckler out of your 18th Century.

21:27.560 --> 21:29.516
Present condition of Psi 2000?

21:29.680 --> 21:33.116
Gravity pull increasing by 2%.
We should stabilise our position.

21:33.280 --> 21:36.352
- Stabilise position.
- Helm is not answering.

21:36.520 --> 21:38.909
- Warp us out.
- No response from engine.

21:39.080 --> 21:42.595
- lmpulse power. Blast us out of orbit.
- lmpulse engine dead.

21:42.760 --> 21:45.479
Engine room we need power.

21:46.520 --> 21:49.239
Mr Scott, acknowledge.
Our controls are dead.

21:51.240 --> 21:53.754
Take her.

21:54.920 --> 21:58.629
- Richelieu, at last.
- Sulu, put that thing away.

21:58.800 --> 22:02.395
For honour, Queen and France.

22:12.960 --> 22:15.190
- Sulu.
- Ah...

22:16.960 --> 22:21.670
- Sulu, give me that.
- l'll protect you, fair maiden.

22:21.840 --> 22:25.150
- Sorry, neither.
- Foul Richelieu.

22:32.080 --> 22:35.197
- Teach me that sometime.
- Take D'Artagnan to sickbay.

22:35.360 --> 22:39.478
Scotty, we need power.
Engine room, acknowledge.

22:39.640 --> 22:41.756
- 'You rang, sir?'
- Who's this?

22:41.920 --> 22:47.677
Captain Kevin Thomas Riley of the
starship Enterprise. And who is this?

22:47.840 --> 22:50.673
This is Captain Kirk.
Where is Mr Scott?

22:50.840 --> 22:53.912
'l've relieved Mr Scott
of his duties.

22:54.880 --> 22:59.158
'Attention cooks,
this is your captain speaking.

22:59.320 --> 23:04.599
'l'd like a double portion of ice cream
for the entire crew.'

23:04.760 --> 23:06.716
- Clear that, too.
- Yes, sir.

23:06.880 --> 23:11.317
'Now your captain will render
an ancient lrish favourite.'

23:11.480 --> 23:14.392
(Sings "l'll Take You
Home Again, Kathleen")

23:14.560 --> 23:19.714
Captain, we have less than 20 minutes
before we enter planet atmosphere.

23:19.880 --> 23:23.156
And burn up. l know, Mr Spock.

23:32.440 --> 23:35.273
'Captain's log, stardate 1704.4.

23:35.440 --> 23:38.989
'Ship spiralling down
towards planet Psi 2000.

23:39.160 --> 23:43.756
'We have 19 minutes of life left,
without engine power or helm control.'

23:43.920 --> 23:46.753
- How did Riley get in?
- He said you wanted us.

23:46.920 --> 23:49.878
- He's cut off power.
- And locked off the mechanism.

23:50.040 --> 23:54.238
- Can't you get to the auxiliary?
- Everything is hooked to the main panel.

23:54.400 --> 23:56.914
Pull the plans for this bulkhead.

23:57.080 --> 24:03.553
The only way to get that door open
is to cut through these wall circuits here.

24:03.760 --> 24:08.880
# The roses all have left your cheeks

24:09.040 --> 24:14.398
# l've watched them
fade away and die #

24:14.560 --> 24:16.471
Status reports, all sections.

24:16.640 --> 24:21.031
Security reports incidents
among the crewmen are increasing.

24:21.200 --> 24:24.351
Go to Alert Baker 2.
Seal off main sections.

24:24.520 --> 24:30.436
All decks, alert system B-2.
Repeat. Alert condition Baker 2.

24:30.600 --> 24:33.558
Seal off main sections. Standby.

24:33.720 --> 24:36.871
Seal off, Captain.
lf we can minimise the spread of this.

24:37.040 --> 24:40.794
- Continue the alert.
- l can't, he's cut off the alert channels.

24:41.960 --> 24:45.953
Lieutenant Uhura,
you've interrupted my song.

24:46.120 --> 24:50.432
'l'm sorry but there will be
no ice cream for you tonight.'

24:50.600 --> 24:53.239
- Cut him off.
- There's no way to do it.

24:53.400 --> 24:57.439
'Attention crew, this is Captain Riley.

24:57.600 --> 25:03.994
'There will be a formal dance in the
bowling alley at 1900 hours tonight.'

25:04.160 --> 25:08.517
He controls the main power panels.
He can override any channel from there.

25:08.680 --> 25:10.830
17 minutes left, sir.

25:21.920 --> 25:24.388
(McCoy) 'Sickbay to bridge.'

25:26.040 --> 25:28.634
- Tie me into the sickbay.
- l'm getting you.

25:28.800 --> 25:32.395
Look, l've got Sulu tranquillised,
we're running tests on him.

25:32.560 --> 25:36.951
Nothing unusual in his bloodstream,
body functions seem normal.

25:37.120 --> 25:41.750
Riley's the immediate problem,
anything you can do to snap him out?

25:41.920 --> 25:44.195
Not until l get further on these tests.

25:44.360 --> 25:48.239
'This is Captain Riley.
l have some additional orders.'

25:48.400 --> 25:51.710
ln the future, all female crew members

25:51.880 --> 25:56.078
will wear their hair loosely,
above their shoulders.

25:56.240 --> 26:01.917
'Use restraint in putting on your make-up,
women should not look made up.

26:02.600 --> 26:03.828
'Crew...

26:04.000 --> 26:10.633
- 'l will render "Kathleen" one more time!'
- Please, not again.

26:11.480 --> 26:17.749
# l'll take you home again, Kathleen #

26:17.920 --> 26:23.074
(Singing continues)

26:42.560 --> 26:48.317
# l've watched them
fade away and die #

26:49.320 --> 26:52.471
Stand by until l give you a signal.

26:53.960 --> 26:58.192
# And tears bedim your loving eyes #

26:59.600 --> 27:03.878
# Oh, l'll take you home
again, Kathleen #

27:04.040 --> 27:08.238
Engineering to bridge, try your helm.
You can keep her stabilised.

27:08.400 --> 27:10.960
Let's have a look at that.

27:19.680 --> 27:23.070
16 minutes left. We've stabilised
but still spiralling down.

27:23.240 --> 27:27.313
Emergency signal, decks 4 and 5.
Fights and disorders.

27:27.480 --> 27:30.916
- Get me sickbay.
- No intercom for sickbay.

27:31.080 --> 27:36.154
Help Dr McCoy. Check Scotty first,
he must get through that bulkhead.

27:49.920 --> 27:52.275
Crewman, report to the lab.

27:56.880 --> 28:00.714
(Man singing)

28:00.880 --> 28:04.839
- What's going on?
- This crewman won't let me by.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.992
- Crewman, stand aside.
- Yes, sir.

28:08.160 --> 28:11.277
# l'll take you home again, Kathleen #

28:11.440 --> 28:12.793
Spock!

28:24.000 --> 28:26.958
- Message from the captain.
- l am doing my best...

28:27.120 --> 28:29.111
We have 14 minutes left.

28:29.280 --> 28:33.398
Even if we were under attack l couldn't
move faster and maintain safety.

28:33.560 --> 28:37.917
Calculations show that you'll take
a minute and a half more than we have.

28:38.080 --> 28:40.389
You can't afford a safety factor.

28:57.560 --> 29:01.189
Biopsy lab, where's my report?

29:03.240 --> 29:08.837
Biopsy, come in!
Harrison, where's my report?

29:10.720 --> 29:15.236
- l'm going to the lab.
- Sir, the tranquilliser is wearing off.

29:15.400 --> 29:19.154
Good, l need him conscious now.
Continue to examine him.

29:19.320 --> 29:21.675
Of course, Doctor.

30:02.400 --> 30:04.356
Get him out of here.

30:05.960 --> 30:08.030
l would have got here sooner but...

30:08.200 --> 30:09.918
- Sir?
- Take the helm!

30:13.120 --> 30:15.873
(Riley) 'And now crew, one more time!'

30:16.040 --> 30:19.635
- Try cutting him off!
- lf l could cut him off, don't you think...

30:22.200 --> 30:24.156
Yes, sir. l'll keep trying.

30:25.240 --> 30:26.229
Sorry.

30:31.840 --> 30:34.229
Scotty, we've got 12 minutes left.

30:34.400 --> 30:37.437
lt will take three of them
to get the engines up to power.

30:37.600 --> 30:40.717
- 'We'll make it, if all goes right.'
- Call me when you've cut through.

30:47.240 --> 30:53.554
- Nurse, where is Dr McCoy?
- He's gone to the lab.

30:58.360 --> 31:02.512
Lab respond, please. Spock here.

31:02.680 --> 31:04.636
Lab?

31:06.680 --> 31:10.116
- Mr Spock?
- What is it, Nurse?

31:10.280 --> 31:13.238
The men from Vulcan
treat their women strangely.

31:16.680 --> 31:18.716
At least, people say that.

31:20.360 --> 31:24.911
But you are part human, too.
l know you don't.

31:25.080 --> 31:29.756
You couldn't hurt me. Would you?

31:40.680 --> 31:43.240
l'm in love with you, Mr Spock.

31:52.880 --> 31:56.668
You, the human Mr Spock.

31:58.720 --> 32:00.676
The Vulcan Mr Spock.

32:02.520 --> 32:05.080
- Nurse...
- Christine, please.

32:06.120 --> 32:09.078
l see things, how honest you are.

32:11.120 --> 32:13.270
l know how you feel.

32:13.440 --> 32:16.989
You hide it, but you do have feelings.

32:18.040 --> 32:20.873
How we must hurt you, torture you.

32:22.920 --> 32:24.876
l'm in control of my emotions.

32:25.920 --> 32:28.070
The others believe that, l don't.

32:30.120 --> 32:32.714
l love you.

32:32.880 --> 32:35.872
l don't know why, but l do love you.
l do love you.

32:36.040 --> 32:39.191
Just as you are.

32:39.360 --> 32:42.909
- Oh, l love you.
- l'm sorry.

32:43.080 --> 32:47.392
(Uhura) 'Captain is enroute.
Mr Spock, can you take the bridge?'

32:49.440 --> 32:51.556
l am sorry.

32:51.720 --> 32:53.915
Christine.

32:55.760 --> 32:57.113
Christine.

32:57.280 --> 32:58.918
(lntercom tone )

32:59.120 --> 33:02.078
'Bridge to sickbay. ls Mr Spock there?'

33:20.000 --> 33:22.753
'Mr Spock,
would you please acknowledge?'

33:56.760 --> 33:58.716
Almost ready, sir.

33:58.880 --> 34:01.235
(Riley continues singing)

34:16.719 --> 34:19.951
- Ready, sir?
- Follow me. Put your phasers on stun.

34:20.120 --> 34:22.429
Don't fire unless he's armed. Go.

34:26.679 --> 34:30.195
- No dance tonight.
- Get him out of here.

34:54.679 --> 34:57.034
l'm in control of my emotions.

34:59.080 --> 35:01.230
(Sobbing) ln control of my emotions.

35:06.600 --> 35:08.556
l'm an officer.

35:09.600 --> 35:11.556
Officer.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.958
My duty. My duty...

35:22.000 --> 35:24.036
ls to...is...

35:40.360 --> 35:43.113
My duty is to...

35:46.160 --> 35:49.516
Too late. Too late.

35:50.560 --> 35:52.516
l'm sorry.

35:56.320 --> 35:59.278
Two, two...

36:00.320 --> 36:02.356
Four...

36:02.520 --> 36:04.954
Six...

36:06.120 --> 36:10.079
Six... Six times.

36:23.520 --> 36:26.876
- We haven't got much time left.
- (Uhura) 'Captain?'

36:29.440 --> 36:32.398
- Kirk here.
- 'Entering outer atmosphere.'

36:32.560 --> 36:34.551
- Captain?
- What?

36:34.720 --> 36:40.033
He's turned the engines off.
lt'll take 30 minutes to regenerate them.

36:40.200 --> 36:44.990
'Ship's outer skin is beginning to heat.
Orbit plot shows we have eight minutes.'

36:45.160 --> 36:48.516
- Scotty...
- l can't change the laws of physics.

36:48.680 --> 36:51.035
l've got to have 30 minutes.

37:00.720 --> 37:02.676
'Captain's log, supplemental.

37:02.840 --> 37:05.400
'The Enterprise spiralling down,
out of control.

37:05.560 --> 37:09.314
'Ship's outer skin heating
due to friction with planet atmosphere.'

37:09.480 --> 37:12.950
- Maybe 22, 23 minutes.
- We've got six.

37:13.120 --> 37:17.716
You can't mix matter and antimatter cold.
We'd go up in the biggest explosion...

37:17.880 --> 37:20.838
We can balance our engines
into a controlled implosion.

37:21.000 --> 37:24.356
That's only a theory,
it's never been done.

37:24.520 --> 37:26.590
Bridge, have you found Mr Spock?

37:26.760 --> 37:31.788
Maybe assuming we had computers
working weeks on the right formula...

37:31.960 --> 37:33.916
(Uhura) 'Mr Spock is not on the bridge.'

37:43.080 --> 37:45.310
l was on the bridge.

37:48.240 --> 37:51.198
Hey Doc, what am l doing here?

37:55.080 --> 37:59.392
- McCoy to bio, start preparing serum.
- (Harrison) 'What, Doctor?'

37:59.560 --> 38:03.269
lt's water. On this planet
water changes to a chain of molecules.

38:03.440 --> 38:07.672
- 'What's that, Doctor?'
- lt passes through perspiration.

38:07.840 --> 38:11.719
Once in the bloodstream,
like alcohol, it depresses judgment.

38:11.880 --> 38:16.795
Get someone to the lab! Tell them
the serum works and prepare more!

38:16.960 --> 38:18.712
(Harrison laughs hysterically)

38:19.320 --> 38:22.278
- Will you let me out of here? l'm all right.
- Release.

38:24.520 --> 38:28.069
(Scott) 'Engineers, man
your stations. Engine rooms report.

38:28.240 --> 38:31.152
'This will be
an emergency restart of engines.'

38:31.320 --> 38:33.276
What happened?

38:33.440 --> 38:39.037
- l could never tell my mother l loved her.
- We've got four minutes, maybe five.

38:39.200 --> 38:41.156
An Earth woman...

38:41.320 --> 38:46.394
living on a planet
where love, emotion is bad taste.

38:46.560 --> 38:50.155
We have to risk a full power start.
The engines were shut off.

38:50.320 --> 38:53.073
Do you hear me?
We've got to risk a full power start!

38:53.240 --> 38:56.471
l respected my father, our customs,
l was ashamed...

38:59.080 --> 39:00.149
Jim.

39:01.400 --> 39:04.870
When l feel friendship for you,
l'm ashamed.

39:05.040 --> 39:07.554
You've got to hear me!

39:08.480 --> 39:12.519
- We've got to risk implosion!
- lt's never been done.

39:15.560 --> 39:21.510
Understand, Jim. l spent my whole
life running to hide my feelings.

39:30.720 --> 39:34.395
- Our only chance is to risk implosion!
- lt's never been done.

39:34.600 --> 39:37.751
Don't tell me that again!
lt's a theory. lt's possible.

39:37.920 --> 39:42.630
We may go up in a ball of fire, but we
have to take that one in 10,000 chance.

39:42.800 --> 39:45.314
(Uhura) 'Captain. Did you find...'

39:45.480 --> 39:48.711
Yes, l found Mr Spock!
l'm talking to Mr Spock!

39:48.880 --> 39:54.557
- 'Yes, sir. Three and a half minutes left.'
- l've got it, the disease.

39:59.120 --> 40:03.557
Love. You're better off without it
and l'm better off without mine.

40:05.600 --> 40:07.556
This vessel...

40:09.600 --> 40:12.478
l give, she takes.

40:13.520 --> 40:16.478
She won't permit me my life.
l've got to live hers.

40:16.640 --> 40:20.394
- Jim?
- l have a beautiful yeoman.

40:20.560 --> 40:22.630
Have you noticed her?

40:22.800 --> 40:27.590
You're allowed to notice her.
A captain is not permitted...

40:27.760 --> 40:28.875
Jim...

40:31.240 --> 40:33.834
There is an intermix formula.

40:35.880 --> 40:39.998
l know why it's called "she".

40:40.160 --> 40:42.435
lt's never been tested.

40:42.600 --> 40:46.275
lt's a theoretical relationship
between time and antimatter.

40:46.440 --> 40:50.433
Flesh woman...to touch...to hold...

40:52.120 --> 40:54.156
A beach to walk on...

40:55.600 --> 40:58.717
A few days... No braid on my shoulder...

40:58.880 --> 41:01.235
- Captain.
- Scotty.

41:03.520 --> 41:05.954
Help.

41:06.160 --> 41:09.675
Stand by to intermix.
l'll call the formula in from the bridge.

41:09.840 --> 41:15.233
'Entering upper stratosphere, Captain.
Skin temperature now 2170 degrees.'

41:15.400 --> 41:17.834
l could hang on.

41:19.880 --> 41:23.589
Tell them.
Clear the corridors, the turbolift.

41:23.760 --> 41:26.479
Hurry.

41:40.520 --> 41:44.752
Never lose you... Never.

42:01.520 --> 42:03.476
Bridge.

42:50.640 --> 42:53.393
Engine room, we're set.

42:57.840 --> 43:00.957
- Hyperbolic course.
- Direction, sir?

43:02.320 --> 43:07.269
Direction...direction...
lt doesn't matter. The way we came.

43:10.120 --> 43:12.156
Course laid in, sir.

43:15.480 --> 43:18.756
- Fuel temperature.
- Level.

43:29.280 --> 43:32.477
No beach to walk on.

43:33.520 --> 43:35.476
Sir?

43:36.600 --> 43:42.197
- Raise antimatter 840 degrees.
- That will take four minutes.

43:42.360 --> 43:45.318
We haven't the time.
We'll have to risk it.

43:45.480 --> 43:47.436
Bridge, we're ready.

43:50.840 --> 43:53.070
Engage.

44:50.880 --> 44:54.156
- Are you all right, Jim?
- You?

44:54.320 --> 44:56.834
We found a cure.
We're over that part.

44:57.000 --> 45:00.629
Obviously, we were successful.
The engines imploded.

45:00.800 --> 45:04.395
Captain, my velocity gauge
is off the scale.

45:04.560 --> 45:06.755
Engine power off the scale as well.

45:06.920 --> 45:11.152
We're travelling faster
than is possible for normal space.

45:11.320 --> 45:14.073
Check elapsed time, Mr Sulu.

45:17.880 --> 45:21.111
My chronometer is running backwards.

45:27.680 --> 45:30.194
Time warp.

45:33.080 --> 45:35.116
We're going backward in time.

45:44.840 --> 45:47.593
Helm, begin reversing power.

45:53.200 --> 45:55.156
Slowly.

45:56.240 --> 46:00.472
Helm answering, sir. Power reversing.

46:16.320 --> 46:18.788
We're back to normal time, Captain.

46:20.840 --> 46:23.479
Engines ahead. Warp one.

46:25.240 --> 46:27.151
Warp one, sir.

46:27.960 --> 46:30.428
- Mr Spock...
- Yes, sir

46:30.600 --> 46:34.479
The time warp... What did it do to us?

46:34.640 --> 46:38.758
We've regressed in time 71 hours.
lt is now three days ago, Captain.

46:40.320 --> 46:44.313
We have three days to live over again.

46:48.480 --> 46:50.789
Not those last three days.

46:50.960 --> 46:53.872
This opens some intriguing prospects,
Captain.

46:54.040 --> 46:57.350
Since the formula worked,
we can go back in time.

46:57.520 --> 47:01.115
To any planet, any era.

47:01.280 --> 47:04.829
We may risk it some day, Mr Spock.

47:05.000 --> 47:09.198
- Resume course to our next destination.
- Course laid in, sir.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.355
Steady as she goes.

47:14.305 --> 47:20.828
