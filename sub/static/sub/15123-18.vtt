WEBVTT

00:02.570 --> 00:06.307
WOMAN: Oh, my God, you are
the stupidest dad in the world!

00:06.340 --> 00:08.676
Did the divorce kill some
of your brain cells?

00:08.709 --> 00:11.579
I hate cleaning houses when
the clients are home.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.281
WOMAN:
I can't believe you!

00:13.314 --> 00:14.648
Be invisible.

00:14.682 --> 00:16.317
NATALIE: Why would you buy me
these jeans?!

00:16.350 --> 00:18.186
Look at these holes!

00:18.219 --> 00:20.554
They're in all
the wrong places!

00:20.588 --> 00:22.090
How am I supposed to know

00:22.123 --> 00:24.625
the right holes
from the wrong holes, huh?!

00:24.658 --> 00:26.494
Well, maybe that's
why Mom left you!

00:29.097 --> 00:31.065
You don't have the right
to ignore my feelings!
* La, la, la, la.

00:31.099 --> 00:32.766
Fine, then I'll
"la-la-la" you!
La, la, la, la,

00:32.800 --> 00:34.735
La-la-la-la!
Can't hear you!
* La-la-la-la!

00:34.768 --> 00:36.604
And I'll tell you
something else, Dad!

00:36.637 --> 00:38.206
You're not fooling anybody

00:38.239 --> 00:40.708
with that
stupid toupee.

00:40.741 --> 00:42.076
MAN:
She's crazy.

00:42.110 --> 00:43.211
This is all my own hair.

00:43.244 --> 00:44.578
(rips)
Ah!

00:46.114 --> 00:48.149
It's made from my own hair.

00:48.182 --> 00:49.817
Say, ladies,

00:49.850 --> 00:52.686
I'm leaving town for a business
trip, for a couple of weeks,

00:52.720 --> 00:55.123
and I'm looking
to hire a live-in

00:55.156 --> 00:57.591
to look after the house
and, uh, Natalie.

00:57.625 --> 01:00.294
One of you interested
in a little extra pay?

01:00.328 --> 01:01.529
No hablo ingles.

01:03.264 --> 01:06.800
(speaks gibberish)... English.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.138
Whoo!

01:10.171 --> 01:11.372
* Here we go

01:11.405 --> 01:14.542
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

01:20.581 --> 01:22.883
(moans)

01:22.916 --> 01:25.153
I guess Hope's not going
to let us sleep in today.

01:25.186 --> 01:27.555
Sh-sh-sh-sh. Maybe if we
just lay here quietly,

01:27.588 --> 01:29.457
she'll go back
to sleep.

01:29.490 --> 01:32.393
Ow! God...
I guess not.
(laughs)

01:32.426 --> 01:33.427
(both chuckle)

01:33.461 --> 01:35.329
Hey, Hope.
(groans)

01:35.363 --> 01:38.599
How about just five
more minutes, okay?

01:38.632 --> 01:39.233
(grunts)

01:39.267 --> 01:40.368
(screams)

01:40.401 --> 01:41.802
What happened?
Nipple, nipple,
nipple!

01:41.835 --> 01:43.737
Okay.
My nipple's caught!
Uh, try pushing it!

01:43.771 --> 01:45.839
Okay...
(screams)

01:45.873 --> 01:46.807
Ooh, God...
(screams)

01:46.840 --> 01:48.642
That's not it!
Try pulling it, try pulling it!

01:48.676 --> 01:49.310
(screams)

01:52.646 --> 01:54.548
Oh!
Oh!

01:54.582 --> 01:56.450
(laughs)
You were right.

01:56.484 --> 01:58.586
Grapes make taking walks
so much more fun.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.454
One mushy one left, you want it?

02:00.488 --> 02:02.290
All yours.

02:12.566 --> 02:14.702
Ha-ha!

02:14.735 --> 02:15.636
I did it.

02:16.337 --> 02:17.938
What's all this?

02:17.971 --> 02:20.441
Jimmy almost lost his nipple
in a crib accident.

02:20.474 --> 02:21.509
Told you those
long nipples were going to

02:21.542 --> 02:22.743
come back to haunt
you one day.

02:22.776 --> 02:24.878
He gets that from
my side of the family.

02:24.912 --> 02:27.748
On the plus side,
they're also very sensitive.

02:27.781 --> 02:29.250
Oh, good to know.

02:29.283 --> 02:31.185
Anyway, the crib's
been recalled,

02:31.219 --> 02:33.254
along with a lot of this
other old baby stuff, too.

02:33.287 --> 02:34.722
It can't be that dangerous.

02:34.755 --> 02:37.191
Jimmy played with most
of this stuff; he's fine.

02:37.225 --> 02:40.394
No, come to think of it,
he was always getting hurt.

02:44.732 --> 02:47.268
(screaming)

02:54.775 --> 02:57.378
My nipple, my nipple, my nipple!

02:57.411 --> 03:00.514
Yeah, in retrospects,
I can see that we should've

03:00.548 --> 03:02.683
paid more attention
to child safety.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.718
And now Hope has to sleep
in a cardboard box

03:04.752 --> 03:06.620
and play with a teddy bear
I made from a bag of rice

03:06.654 --> 03:08.356
and a fuzzy toilet seat cover.

03:08.389 --> 03:09.590
Come to think of it,
she could choke on the rice.

03:09.623 --> 03:10.858
Damn it!

03:10.891 --> 03:12.493
We need to find a way
to make some fast money!

03:12.526 --> 03:14.595
Jimmy, you think if we knew
how to make fast money,

03:14.628 --> 03:16.830
we would have spent our whole
lives making slow money?!

03:16.864 --> 03:19.800
Unfortunately, I know how to
make some fast money.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.969
Hello.

03:22.002 --> 03:24.372
Hi. I don't know if you're still
looking for a live-in but...

03:24.405 --> 03:25.873
LANE:
Oh, I'm so sorry.

03:25.906 --> 03:27.341
We already hired somebody.

03:27.375 --> 03:28.909
She threw soup at me!

03:28.942 --> 03:30.411
I quit.
Wha...

03:32.646 --> 03:33.847
You're hired.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.449
(chuckles)

03:39.353 --> 03:40.688
Burt, if we go over it
one more time,

03:40.721 --> 03:42.022
we're just gonna
start crying again.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.925
It's just for two weeks,
till we have enough money

03:44.958 --> 03:47.695
to buy Hope all the new
stuff she needs. (sobs)

03:47.728 --> 03:49.530
We can make money
some other way.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.765
What if I sell my plasma

03:51.799 --> 03:53.867
to those people that make
the fancy TVs?!

03:55.836 --> 03:57.605
I miss Virginia.

03:57.638 --> 04:00.541
We all miss
Virginia, Maw maw.

04:00.574 --> 04:01.842
That's why we're
eating meatloaf,

04:01.875 --> 04:04.345
which somebody thought would be
great if it was made of tuna.

04:04.378 --> 04:06.714
Well, it should've worked.
It's the chicken from the sea.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.582
But that's stupid,
no one eats chicken meatloaf.

04:08.616 --> 04:09.450
It doesn't even make sense!

04:11.952 --> 04:14.388
I'm sorry, it's not the loaf.
I just miss my wife.

04:14.422 --> 04:17.057
Time for my bath.
Been a couple of days, so

04:17.090 --> 04:18.326
prepare for a long one.

04:18.359 --> 04:18.959
(chuckles)

04:20.428 --> 04:21.895
Good luck with that.

04:21.929 --> 04:22.930
I'll tell you what you
missed on Phineas & Ferb.

04:22.963 --> 04:25.065
Oh, too late. I already got
my finger on my nose.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.400
You can put your finger
anywhere you want.

04:26.434 --> 04:28.436
You're still bathing Maw Maw.

04:28.469 --> 04:29.503
Only reason we're doing this is
'cause of your baby!

04:29.537 --> 04:30.638
(whines)

04:30.671 --> 04:32.906
I don't blame you.
I blame society

04:32.940 --> 04:34.608
which says we can't let you
swallow the same toys,

04:34.642 --> 04:35.676
which passed harmlessly
through your father.

04:37.745 --> 04:40.614
Look, I'll do all the other
chores except for Maw Maw.

04:40.648 --> 04:42.316
Every time I try to take care of
here, she thinks I'm Paw Paw,

04:42.350 --> 04:43.083
and she tries to kiss me!

04:43.116 --> 04:43.951
She did that to
me all the time.

04:43.984 --> 04:45.619
You just have to
know how to handle it.

04:48.121 --> 04:51.759
Hey there,
Mr. Gardener Man,

04:51.792 --> 04:55.363
I got something better for you
to do with that green thumb.

04:58.065 --> 04:59.900
Hello, Burt!

05:01.535 --> 05:03.003
Good luck with that bath.

05:03.036 --> 05:05.005
Just so you're prepared, the
carpet does match the drapes,

05:05.038 --> 05:06.073
and it's a deep shag.

05:08.141 --> 05:11.479
NATALIE: Oh, my God.
(glass breaking)

05:18.118 --> 05:19.987
You can stop
doing my laundry!

05:20.020 --> 05:21.455
I won't need any more outfits

05:21.489 --> 05:23.090
because I'm never
leaving my house again!

05:26.660 --> 05:28.362
What's wrong?

05:28.396 --> 05:31.365
I have a third eye,
that's what's wrong!

05:31.399 --> 05:35.969
Oh, but that's nothing.
I can fix that.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.004
You can?

05:37.037 --> 05:37.938
Oh, yeah!

05:43.644 --> 05:44.512
Okay...

05:45.879 --> 05:47.981
Oh, my God!
It's completely disappeared!

05:48.015 --> 05:51.084
Mm-hmm. I've always been good
with makeup and stuff.

05:51.118 --> 05:52.686
My son only lets me
do it to him

05:52.720 --> 05:54.622
when we've both
had a few beers,

05:54.655 --> 05:57.491
and I absolutely promise
never to tell anyone.

05:57.525 --> 05:59.527
Don't tell anyone
I said that...

06:02.162 --> 06:05.933
(sighs)
Okay!

06:05.966 --> 06:07.100
You're dry now,

06:07.134 --> 06:09.036
and don't worry, that thing
on your back was a raisin.

06:09.069 --> 06:09.937
Oh, thank you.

06:09.970 --> 06:12.105
I feel better.

06:12.139 --> 06:13.641
Let me just get your
fiber shake ready

06:13.674 --> 06:16.009
and your humidifier
like you like it,

06:16.043 --> 06:17.445
and you are good to go!

06:17.478 --> 06:19.713
Just finding the switch
on this thing...

06:19.747 --> 06:22.983
(Old-time trumpet music plays)

06:23.016 --> 06:25.819
Let me pour you a drink.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.020
Wilfrid...

06:27.054 --> 06:29.189
(rattling)

06:29.222 --> 06:33.093
Make that cocktail
the same way I like my men.

06:34.662 --> 06:37.665
Stiff...

06:37.698 --> 06:40.601
I'm not Paw Paw, I'm your
great grandson, Maw Maw!

06:41.802 --> 06:43.170
Ah!

06:44.104 --> 06:46.607
What are you doing in my room?

06:47.975 --> 06:49.810
Why am I sweating?

06:49.843 --> 06:52.079
Am I hot flashing again?

06:52.112 --> 06:53.514
When will this menopause end?!

06:57.851 --> 06:58.952
(screams)

06:58.986 --> 07:00.120
(screams)

07:00.153 --> 07:01.088
Hey, it's me!

07:01.121 --> 07:02.490
Sorry.

07:02.523 --> 07:03.891
It's a little chilly out here.

07:03.924 --> 07:06.126
Didn't want my lips to get
chapped before I saw ya.

07:06.159 --> 07:08.896
The only thing that doesn't
cover is your lips.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.731
What are you
doing here anyway?

07:10.764 --> 07:11.965
I missed ya.

07:11.999 --> 07:13.934
So I thought I'd come over here
and climb through your window.

07:13.967 --> 07:16.837
Aw, I missed you, too.
Mmm...

07:16.870 --> 07:20.040
It will be just like when
we were teenagers.

07:20.073 --> 07:22.543
Even better, because now we
don't have to make it quick

07:22.576 --> 07:24.177
so you could be home
in time for Alf.

07:24.211 --> 07:25.212
Ooh!

07:31.585 --> 07:34.488
(yells)

07:34.522 --> 07:36.524
(spitting)
(chuckles)
Time to wake up, Wilfrid, dear.

07:38.058 --> 07:40.694
(sniffs)
What's that smell?

07:40.728 --> 07:43.230
Breakfast,
like I make every morning.

07:43.263 --> 07:45.533
Come on, it's
getting cold.

07:50.170 --> 07:53.106
French toast will be ready
in a jiffy.

07:53.140 --> 07:56.209
And then I'll take care
of the baby while you eat.

07:56.243 --> 07:59.913
And the syrup's heating up,
just like you like it, too.

08:02.683 --> 08:05.519
(old-time music playing)

08:05.553 --> 08:08.088
Well, good morning, dear.

08:20.267 --> 08:22.536
I'm so glad you got this job.

08:22.570 --> 08:24.004
I know, that was quite a night.

08:24.037 --> 08:26.039
It actually was like
being a teenager again.

08:26.073 --> 08:27.340
It was awesome.

08:27.374 --> 08:30.010
Although I do kind of wish
I was watching Alf right now.

08:30.043 --> 08:32.613
Listen, you better get out of
here before Natalie wakes up.

08:32.646 --> 08:35.115
And use the window,
for old time's sake.

08:38.051 --> 08:39.720
Oh!
Wha...?!

08:39.753 --> 08:41.622
Whoa! What happened
to the ladder?

08:41.655 --> 08:43.624
VIRGINIA :
Wha... huh?

08:45.058 --> 08:47.127
Get...

08:50.631 --> 08:51.965
What the hell?!

08:51.999 --> 08:53.300
Who is that?!

08:53.333 --> 08:55.736
Who is that?!

08:55.769 --> 08:57.204
Oh...

08:57.237 --> 08:59.973
Would you believe your dad
hired a butler?
(scoffs)

09:00.007 --> 09:02.776
And the butler
just did it.

09:02.810 --> 09:04.311
Not helping.

09:09.783 --> 09:11.318
Put your pants on,

09:11.351 --> 09:14.154
and stop everything you were
doing or were about to do.

09:14.187 --> 09:16.089
Burt, take this one downstairs.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.660
BURT: Okay, Romeo,
let's go.

09:19.693 --> 09:23.897
(chuckles)
He walks like a penguin.

09:23.931 --> 09:25.699
What are you doing?

09:25.733 --> 09:28.335
You shouldn't be sneaking
boys into your room.

09:28.368 --> 09:29.870
You do.

09:29.903 --> 09:32.105
Wha... he's my husband.

09:32.139 --> 09:35.008
Well Robert's my boyfriend,
and we're just as in love.

09:35.042 --> 09:37.845
Probably more so, because
we're young and hot.

09:37.878 --> 09:39.713
Wha....
Why are you so
upset about this?

09:39.747 --> 09:41.014
I thought you were
going to be cool.

09:41.048 --> 09:43.851
No, no, no,
I am still cool!

09:43.884 --> 09:45.919
I'm like, um... wha...

09:45.953 --> 09:47.287
Alicia Silverstone.

09:47.320 --> 09:50.157
And Alicia would say
that you are clueless

09:50.190 --> 09:52.059
about the risks
of teenage sex.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.694
I don't know who that is.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.062
Is that like a friend
of yours or something?

09:55.095 --> 09:57.064
Well, she was a very big star.

09:57.097 --> 09:59.399
Look, whatever celebrity
you teens are into nowadays,

09:59.432 --> 10:01.835
they say "don't do it!"

10:01.869 --> 10:03.203
Raven Symone!

10:04.071 --> 10:05.739
I don't know! I...

10:05.773 --> 10:07.140
Kathy Perry!

10:07.174 --> 10:09.409
(beep, whir)

10:09.442 --> 10:11.344
Science...

10:11.378 --> 10:13.647
Is there anything
you can't do?

10:13.681 --> 10:15.749
Well, I talked
to Natalie.

10:15.783 --> 10:17.217
She says, they
haven't had sex yet.

10:17.250 --> 10:18.686
But I don't know
if I believe her.

10:18.719 --> 10:20.087
I talked to Robert.
They haven't.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.355
But he's getting close.
I gave him a few tips.

10:22.389 --> 10:24.658
He is a slow song
and a wine cooler

10:24.692 --> 10:25.959
away from closing the deal.

10:25.993 --> 10:27.427
What is wrong with you?

10:27.460 --> 10:29.029
Why are you
encouraging this kid?

10:29.062 --> 10:30.898
What if Natalie
gets pregnant?

10:30.931 --> 10:33.200
Well, you got pregnant.
You don't like our life?

10:33.233 --> 10:35.002
No, Burt, I do!

10:35.035 --> 10:37.771
Well, it's just, as a rule,
teenagers should...

10:37.805 --> 10:40.140
Son of a bitch,
he's going back up there.

10:40.173 --> 10:42.743
Oh, yeah. I told him to
wait about ten minutes.

10:42.776 --> 10:44.044
I guess he
couldn't hold off.

10:44.077 --> 10:46.146
Which is disappointing,
because most of my tips

10:46.179 --> 10:47.147
were about just that.

10:49.116 --> 10:51.184
Seriously?!

10:51.218 --> 10:52.452
Shouldn't you be cleaning

10:52.485 --> 10:53.921
or making me a cheese
questadilla or something?

10:53.954 --> 10:54.922
You two, out of bed.

10:54.955 --> 10:56.757
I'm going to show you
where this can lead to.

10:56.790 --> 10:59.126
I'm your ghost of
teen pregnancy future.

11:01.128 --> 11:03.130
This is where we live.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.331
You can't see it
from here,

11:04.364 --> 11:06.066
but there's
Silly Putty

11:06.099 --> 11:07.267
plugging holes
in the roof.

11:07.300 --> 11:09.202
On the plus side,
we have a ton

11:09.236 --> 11:10.137
of empty
Silly Putty eggs,

11:10.170 --> 11:11.905
which we can use
for all sorts of things.

11:15.943 --> 11:18.111
That's my son pretending
to smoke a pipe

11:18.145 --> 11:20.013
and getting a foot rub from
his great-grandmother.

11:20.047 --> 11:21.414
I don't know
what's going on,

11:21.448 --> 11:23.350
but trust me,
those are the actions

11:23.383 --> 11:25.786
of a kid raised
by teen parents.

11:25.819 --> 11:28.088
A multigenerational
household

11:28.121 --> 11:30.157
leads to a strong
family bond.

11:30.958 --> 11:32.726
How's that Harvey Wallbanger?

11:32.760 --> 11:36.196
Uh, tip-top, you
little hotsy-totsy.

11:36.229 --> 11:38.298
23 skidoo.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.302
Okay. I got nothing
for that one.

11:45.172 --> 11:48.241
Here's what I really
wanted to show you.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.282
Cool! You went to Paris?

11:55.315 --> 11:57.084
No. My friend,
Becky Decker,

11:57.117 --> 11:58.852
from high school did.

11:58.886 --> 12:01.321
She went to Paris with
her college French class.

12:01.354 --> 12:03.123
And this is from
my two friends

12:03.156 --> 12:04.892
who went to
Hungary and Turkey

12:04.925 --> 12:07.060
while I was at home
hungry for turkey.

12:07.094 --> 12:10.530
Oh, here's our
prom photo.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.866
BURT: How many people
get to look that fancy

12:12.900 --> 12:14.401
when welcoming their son
into the world?

12:14.434 --> 12:16.269
Look at those
fresh-faced kids.

12:16.303 --> 12:19.006
Take a good, hard
look at that.

12:19.039 --> 12:20.808
This is what
they look like

12:20.841 --> 12:22.042
four years later.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.443
Whoa, you guys aged,

12:23.476 --> 12:25.312
like, 20 years.

12:25.345 --> 12:27.147
Yeah, but we haven't aged at all
since then.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.248
Explain that.

12:28.281 --> 12:29.482
Look, Natalie's maid,

12:29.516 --> 12:31.351
I appreciate
what you're trying to do,

12:31.384 --> 12:32.786
but we're in love.

12:32.820 --> 12:34.354
And your son seems
to be hooking up

12:34.387 --> 12:35.823
with your grandmother,

12:35.856 --> 12:37.858
so I don't know why
you're worried about us.

12:37.891 --> 12:39.359
We're staying together,
and that's that.

12:39.392 --> 12:41.428
Yes!
No, we're not.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.030
I'm sorry, Robert.

12:43.063 --> 12:44.197
I do love you, but there's

12:44.231 --> 12:45.532
too much I want to do
in my life.

12:45.565 --> 12:46.900
I... I want

12:46.934 --> 12:48.501
to try crepes in Paris

12:48.535 --> 12:50.570
and gelato in Rome.

12:50.603 --> 12:53.240
I want to trip my face off
in Amsterdam!

12:53.273 --> 12:55.375
This is all
too much for me.

12:55.408 --> 12:57.144
I think we should stop
seeing each other.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.227
Love killer.

13:14.261 --> 13:16.529
You killed love.

13:16.563 --> 13:18.498
Here's your high-ball, darling.

13:18.531 --> 13:21.401
Hope you don't mind
pot roast tonight.

13:21.434 --> 13:23.103
Horsefeathers, you dumb Dora.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.305
You know I think
your cooking is swell.

13:25.338 --> 13:26.573
Oh, Wilfrid.

13:26.606 --> 13:29.042
Mmm...

13:29.076 --> 13:31.178
(chuckling)

13:34.381 --> 13:36.316
Oh, hey.

13:36.349 --> 13:38.351
Jimmy, you know I love
your quirky family,

13:38.385 --> 13:40.253
but you nailing
your great-grandmother

13:40.287 --> 13:42.089
is going to be
a real deal breaker.

13:42.122 --> 13:43.891
Maw Maw's just in one
of her delusions.

13:43.924 --> 13:44.824
She thinks I'm Wilfrid.

13:44.858 --> 13:46.593
But she's easier
to take care of this way.

13:46.626 --> 13:47.995
She actually takes care of me.

13:48.028 --> 13:49.997
And if things go too far,
I can stop her

13:50.030 --> 13:51.298
just by spraying her
with this bottle.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.000
So kissing her on the lips
wasn't going too far?

13:53.033 --> 13:54.434
Well, first of all,
my mouth was closed.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.436
And second,
can you smell that pot roast?

13:56.469 --> 13:58.538
Come on in.

13:58.571 --> 14:00.874
Dinner's...

14:00.908 --> 14:03.210
What the hell is your sister,
Mabel, doing here?

14:03.243 --> 14:05.145
Oh, gee willikers,
honey buns.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.915
Your pot roast is so swell,
I invited her for dinner, see?

14:07.948 --> 14:09.416
(both laughing)

14:09.449 --> 14:12.219
How could you invite her today
on this special occasion?

14:12.252 --> 14:13.620
What special occasion?

14:13.653 --> 14:16.890
Unbelievable.

14:16.924 --> 14:18.191
Every year!
Aah!

14:18.225 --> 14:21.061
Get the spray bottle!

14:21.094 --> 14:24.097
You always forget
our anniversary every year!

14:24.131 --> 14:25.232
Sabrina!

14:25.265 --> 14:26.934
Why do I always
get my hopes up

14:26.967 --> 14:28.468
every year?!

14:28.501 --> 14:30.637
Squirt her! Squirt her!
(grunting)

14:30.670 --> 14:32.305
You know what?
I don't think I should.

14:32.339 --> 14:34.441
'Cause she just really looks
like she's hurting right now.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.209
She's really hurting me!

14:36.243 --> 14:37.377
That's who she's hurting!

14:41.481 --> 14:43.984
Do you still believe
in love, Robert?
Oh, my God!

14:44.017 --> 14:46.053
Oh, it's okay!
It's okay, Robert! It's Burt.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.354
It's your ex-girlfriend's
temporary maid's husband.

14:48.588 --> 14:50.257
I think I have an idea

14:50.290 --> 14:52.225
how we can get Natalie back.

14:53.293 --> 14:55.395
BOTH:
Do you still believe in love?

14:55.428 --> 14:58.098
(all screaming)

15:06.006 --> 15:08.675
You brought us to your
high school sex hideout?

15:08.708 --> 15:11.178
You know, it sounds cheap
when you say it like that.

15:11.211 --> 15:14.014
Me and Virginia called it
the "Stabbin' Cabin."

15:14.047 --> 15:16.316
Which sounds
cheap, too, now,

15:16.349 --> 15:17.717
but back then,
we thought it was poetic.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.619
I brought you guys
here 'cause my wife

15:19.652 --> 15:21.188
showed you what our
lives were like,

15:21.221 --> 15:22.422
but she left out some parts.

15:25.292 --> 15:27.227
(chuckles)

15:27.260 --> 15:29.997
These ticket stubs are
from our first movie date:

15:30.030 --> 15:31.664
Beverly Hills Cop II.

15:31.698 --> 15:32.832
Ah.

15:32.865 --> 15:36.236
This kernel of popcorn fell
down Virginia's cleavage.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.505
Just when you think boobs
can't get any better--

15:38.538 --> 15:40.173
butter flavored.

15:40.207 --> 15:41.008
(sniffs, chuckles)

15:41.041 --> 15:43.576
Ah, this is the gum
wrapper necklace

15:43.610 --> 15:45.478
that Virginia made me
at pregnant girl camp.

15:45.512 --> 15:48.048
(laughing)

15:48.081 --> 15:50.183
Ah, these are the
pretend magazine covers

15:50.217 --> 15:52.385
we had made at Four Flags:
Good Adventure Theme Park.

15:52.419 --> 15:53.620
How is that place?

15:53.653 --> 15:55.755
It's almost awesome.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.490
Look.

15:57.524 --> 15:59.692
Virginia and I were perfect
for each other.

15:59.726 --> 16:02.062
Waiting wouldn't have made us
more perfect,

16:02.095 --> 16:04.097
but it could have made us
miss out on perfect,

16:04.131 --> 16:06.266
and I just don't want
to see you guys miss out

16:06.299 --> 16:08.035
on your chance to have
the perfect person, either.

16:09.436 --> 16:11.471
Oh, my God,
he's right.

16:11.504 --> 16:13.740
We are perfect
for each other.

16:13.773 --> 16:15.575
The world might be
against you sometimes,

16:15.608 --> 16:17.577
but you'll always
have an ally in me.

16:17.610 --> 16:19.079
(car door closes)
VIRGINIA:
Natalie!

16:19.112 --> 16:20.780
Natalie!

16:20.813 --> 16:22.615
I was never here!

16:22.649 --> 16:25.352
And remember,
snitches get stitches.

16:30.757 --> 16:32.725
Natalie?

16:34.261 --> 16:35.795
Oh, my God.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.264
She's coming in!

16:37.297 --> 16:39.166
Robert, hide!

16:39.199 --> 16:41.268
She's going to kill you!

16:48.775 --> 16:52.245
Natalie, I know you're in here.

16:54.647 --> 16:56.516
How'd you find me?

16:56.549 --> 16:58.251
I called your dad.

16:58.285 --> 17:00.420
He uses GPS to
track your phone.

17:00.453 --> 17:02.422
That put me
in this general area,

17:02.455 --> 17:04.491
and then it didn't take
the Mentalist to figure out

17:04.524 --> 17:05.692
you were in the Stabbin' Cabin.

17:05.725 --> 17:07.260
Where's Robert?

17:07.294 --> 17:08.728
He's not here yet.

17:08.761 --> 17:10.797
You got to get out of here
before you ruin everything.

17:10.830 --> 17:12.299
I'd rather ruin tonight

17:12.332 --> 17:14.201
than let you ruin
your whole life.

17:14.234 --> 17:16.169
Look, Robert and I are in love.

17:16.203 --> 17:17.470
We're meant to be,

17:17.504 --> 17:19.539
just like you and Burt,
but with better grades.

17:19.572 --> 17:22.642
Fine, but that doesn't mean
you have to sleep together.

17:22.675 --> 17:24.144
But we want to.

17:24.177 --> 17:25.478
We're ready.

17:25.512 --> 17:27.214
You're ready to have a baby?

17:27.247 --> 17:28.515
We know how to use condoms.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.650
We put them on cucumbers
in health class.

17:30.683 --> 17:32.619
First of all,
putting them on cucumbers

17:32.652 --> 17:34.721
is just setting yourself up
for disappointment.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.323
And besides,

17:36.356 --> 17:39.592
condoms don't always work,

17:39.626 --> 17:42.462
and guys don't always stay.

17:42.495 --> 17:44.731
Burt did,
and Robert would, too.

17:44.764 --> 17:47.834
And we could have a happy family
just like you two.

17:47.867 --> 17:49.436
Yeah, fine. Maybe you will.

17:49.469 --> 17:51.371
Maybe you will be just like me.

17:51.404 --> 17:52.805
Maybe there'll
be an accident,

17:52.839 --> 17:55.175
and maybe Robert
will do the right thing

17:55.208 --> 17:58.878
and you'll have a family
and be happy just like me.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.348
But...

18:01.381 --> 18:05.885
you'll always wonder
why he stayed.

18:05.918 --> 18:09.489
Was it for you or the baby?

18:09.522 --> 18:11.824
You'll always wonder
if you kept him from something,

18:11.858 --> 18:14.294
from being
something more.

18:14.327 --> 18:16.263
Let's be honest--
probably not a lot more,

18:16.296 --> 18:18.131
but something.

18:18.165 --> 18:20.600
Did he stay
because he wanted to

18:20.633 --> 18:22.635
or because he had to?

18:22.669 --> 18:24.371
I poked a hole in the condom.

18:24.404 --> 18:26.739
(gasps)
What?

18:26.773 --> 18:29.276
Not your condom; our condom.

18:29.309 --> 18:30.510
Burt, what are you...?

18:30.543 --> 18:32.445
Look, Virginia,
from the moment I met you,

18:32.479 --> 18:33.813
I knew you were the one.

18:33.846 --> 18:36.483
I also knew you were way,
way out of my league.

18:36.516 --> 18:38.185
I was not.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.819
I was in a back brace.

18:39.852 --> 18:41.421
That was a bonus.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.656
It was like you were hot
and bionic.

18:43.690 --> 18:45.592
Plus smart and funny.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.160
I knew my only shot

18:47.194 --> 18:49.362
was to get you pregnant
so you had to marry me

18:49.396 --> 18:50.897
before you figured out
you could do better.

18:50.930 --> 18:53.933
So, your plan for a lifetime
of happiness

18:53.966 --> 18:57.170
was to trick me into getting
pregnant at 15 years old?

18:57.204 --> 18:59.339
That was the best
I could come up with.

19:00.273 --> 19:02.242
Well...

19:02.275 --> 19:04.744
it's hard to argue
with your results.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.559
(Natalie clears throat)

19:19.592 --> 19:21.294
I'm confused.

19:21.328 --> 19:22.895
Does that mean we're
supposed to have sex

19:22.929 --> 19:24.397
or not have sex or...

19:24.431 --> 19:26.233
Do whatever you want.
We don't care.

19:26.266 --> 19:28.268
It was never
really about you.

19:32.272 --> 19:33.906
* I'll never stop loving you

19:33.940 --> 19:35.842
Oh... look.

19:35.875 --> 19:38.211
(sighing):
Oh...

19:38.245 --> 19:42.449
* Whatever else I may do

19:42.482 --> 19:44.551
Happy anniversary, darling.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.653
It's beautiful.

19:46.686 --> 19:49.489
* My love for you

19:49.522 --> 19:53.326
* Will live till time itself

19:53.360 --> 19:55.562
* Is through

19:57.330 --> 19:59.266
* I'll never stop
wanting you... *

19:59.299 --> 20:00.600
What the hell is going on?

20:00.633 --> 20:02.335
Oh.

20:02.369 --> 20:05.305
We're just giving Maw Maw
a special memory.

20:05.338 --> 20:07.374
It's cool.
I'm fine with it.

20:07.407 --> 20:08.641
He's allowed to touch
anything above the waist,

20:08.675 --> 20:10.009
and her boobs are so low,

20:10.042 --> 20:11.278
that doesn't really allow
for much of anything.

20:13.746 --> 20:15.915
When it comes
to wives,

20:15.948 --> 20:19.819
Barbara June,
you are the cat's meow.

20:19.852 --> 20:22.555
Speaking of things that purr,

20:22.589 --> 20:25.658
I have a gift you can open.

20:25.692 --> 20:28.261
Here's a hint.

20:28.295 --> 20:29.896
It's my legs.

20:29.929 --> 20:32.399
Okay, we're done.

20:35.535 --> 20:37.337
Why am I wet?

20:38.838 --> 20:41.674
And why are there
decorations out here?

20:41.708 --> 20:44.311
Did I drown in the tub,
and this is my wake?

20:45.878 --> 20:47.780
(sinisterly):
Ooh...

20:47.814 --> 20:50.417
I'm here. I'm here.

20:50.450 --> 20:53.486
You're not dead, Maw Maw.

20:53.520 --> 20:55.855
Damn it, this life
is taking forever.

20:55.888 --> 20:57.890
Hey.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.926
This is Wilfrid's and my song.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.594
Really? I didn't know that.
Oh, yeah.

21:01.628 --> 21:04.063
We danced to this song
years ago

21:04.096 --> 21:05.632
on a wonderful anniversary.

21:05.665 --> 21:08.835
It's the year Wilfrid
gave me this necklace.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.470
It's my favorite memory.

21:12.104 --> 21:14.807
That's why I'll
never take it off.

21:16.876 --> 21:18.811
* I'll never...

21:18.845 --> 21:20.680
Well, I guess I won't
be getting that necklace back.

21:20.713 --> 21:23.616
I will get you a new necklace
on our anniversary,

21:23.650 --> 21:26.753
which I promise to never forget.

21:28.388 --> 21:30.323
You taste like
your great-grandmother.

21:30.357 --> 21:31.458
I'll brush my teeth.

21:35.662 --> 21:38.498
Let's go, Cavs.
