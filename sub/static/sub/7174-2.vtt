WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.370
Previousy on The Expanse...

00:03.840 --> 00:06.270
Picked up a Mayday. Looks
like a light freighter.

00:06.300 --> 00:07.740
Calls itself the Scopuli.

00:07.770 --> 00:09.070
We're obligated to check it out.

00:09.110 --> 00:10.570
- It's pirate bait.
- Purge the logs.

00:10.610 --> 00:12.810
We never received that signal.

00:12.840 --> 00:14.240
I have something for you.

00:14.280 --> 00:15.610
Little lost daughter case.

00:16.980 --> 00:19.080
So what's my contract exactly?

00:19.120 --> 00:22.050
Find Julie Mao. If she's still here
on Ceres, detain her and ship her home.

00:22.090 --> 00:24.190
Kidnap job. My pleasure.

00:24.220 --> 00:25.790
Anybody grew up this far from the sun

00:25.820 --> 00:28.090
won't give a good goddamn
what planet you're from.

00:28.130 --> 00:31.300
Real sky over your head and real
gravity holding you on the ground,

00:31.330 --> 00:32.400
they don't trust you.

00:32.430 --> 00:35.070
That distress call we never received,

00:35.100 --> 00:36.570
it was logged with HQ.

00:36.600 --> 00:39.570
Holden, you'll head up
this rescue, or salvage.

00:39.600 --> 00:41.100
Put a shuttle team together.

00:41.140 --> 00:42.810
So, just for the record, guys,

00:42.840 --> 00:44.370
I don't wanna be here right now.

00:44.410 --> 00:46.280
This must be the beacon that called us.

00:46.310 --> 00:48.750
Forwarding you an A-1 tight
beam from the Canterbury.

00:48.780 --> 00:50.510
Torpedo launch!

00:50.550 --> 00:51.580
Canterbury, burn like
hell, you got incoming.

00:55.720 --> 00:57.090
Real lemon works best,

00:57.120 --> 00:59.190
if you could ever get your hands on one.

00:59.220 --> 01:01.230
It's a crucial part of the formula.

01:01.260 --> 01:04.430
Neutralizes acidity, adds body,

01:04.459 --> 01:05.630
balances pH.

01:07.270 --> 01:08.430
Something like that.

01:09.170 --> 01:10.130
Here.

01:11.270 --> 01:13.100
A perfect cup of coffee.

01:15.840 --> 01:17.340
Ah!

01:18.540 --> 01:19.980
- It's an acquired taste.
- Yeah.

01:20.010 --> 01:21.580
- So, wait and see.
- Yeah.

01:22.280 --> 01:23.550
Hey, what's your name?

01:24.450 --> 01:25.520
Ade.

01:26.250 --> 01:27.720
I'm the new navigator.

01:31.590 --> 01:33.020
Jim,

01:35.630 --> 01:37.160
there's something you should know.

01:39.130 --> 01:40.330
Hoss.

01:41.930 --> 01:43.030
Hoss!

01:43.070 --> 01:44.940
Debris field. Buckle up!

01:48.010 --> 01:49.140
I'll try to drive us out of it.

01:54.750 --> 01:56.110
How bad are we gonna catch it?

01:56.150 --> 01:57.310
Pretty bad.

01:58.920 --> 02:01.890
Right, sweetheart. You
know how much I love you.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.074

02:49.400 --> 02:51.570
Airlock breach! We're losing pressure!

02:51.600 --> 02:53.700
Somebody close the hatch! I'm on it!

03:31.380 --> 03:33.310
Somebody shut that damn airlock!

03:55.730 --> 03:56.970
Son of a bitch.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.200
We're through.

04:07.680 --> 04:09.150
Do we still have scopes?

04:12.750 --> 04:15.390
Damn straight. Do not lose that ship.

04:15.420 --> 04:16.519
What?

04:18.589 --> 04:20.820
- Jesus, you're not...
- We're going after them.

04:20.860 --> 04:22.089
- Buddy, I don't think...
- We're losing them!

04:22.130 --> 04:23.990
Don't do it, Alex.

04:24.030 --> 04:26.460
They just dusted 50 of our friends.

04:26.500 --> 04:28.000
Well, let's not make it 55.

04:28.030 --> 04:32.140
Alex, I'm telling you
to go after that ship.

04:32.170 --> 04:34.000
What if they don't like being followed?

04:35.510 --> 04:37.570
They slip off that screen,
they're gone forever.

04:39.340 --> 04:40.880
They'll get away with this.

04:46.370 --> 04:47.970
What is wrong with you? I gave an order!

04:48.010 --> 04:49.940
You think rank matters now?

04:49.970 --> 04:51.170
Get up, I'll do it myself.

04:52.010 --> 04:53.110
Get up!

04:55.880 --> 04:57.380
We're not going anywhere.

05:09.630 --> 05:11.290
Hey! Hey! Hey! Whoa, whoa!

05:11.330 --> 05:14.000
Let's just take a deep breath
here, people. All of you.

06:09.050 --> 06:10.790
Water ration exceeded.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.660
Water ration exceeded.

06:28.370 --> 06:30.970
They're trying to thirst us out.

06:31.010 --> 06:33.580
- Who's that?
- Earth, Mars.

06:33.610 --> 06:36.180
The water shipment's not late, copain.

06:36.210 --> 06:37.750
They're holdin' it back.

06:37.780 --> 06:39.850
You seem pretty sure about that.

06:39.880 --> 06:41.380
Water means life.

06:41.420 --> 06:44.120
One shipment late, you got protests.

06:44.150 --> 06:45.350
Two shipments late,

06:45.390 --> 06:47.190
you got dead people in the street.

06:47.220 --> 06:48.860
And it's gonna get worse.

06:48.890 --> 06:50.030
Mark my words.

07:18.460 --> 07:19.520
Christ.

07:38.080 --> 07:41.540
"Father, bother, poured hot
coffee in the parking lot."

07:43.380 --> 07:46.780
"Father, bother, poured hot
coffee in the parking lot."

07:46.820 --> 07:48.820
Home. I'm home.

07:55.490 --> 07:57.460
Show me my files.

08:02.300 --> 08:04.570
Copy all files.

08:06.240 --> 08:10.110
Replay my last messages.

08:10.140 --> 08:13.240
I tried to give you the best of all worlds,

08:13.280 --> 08:16.480
and you choose to live
like some filthy handmaid

08:16.510 --> 08:18.950
among the riff-raff of the Solar System.

08:18.980 --> 08:20.950
Since you have no
intention of returning home,

08:20.980 --> 08:24.250
I'm forced to consider
selling The Razorback.

08:24.290 --> 08:26.620
You're naive, sweetheart.

08:26.660 --> 08:28.860
It's time to come home.

08:28.890 --> 08:31.860
Please. I'll make everything right again.

08:32.700 --> 08:35.130
Jesus. Spare me.

08:35.169 --> 08:37.870
Show me my replies.

08:37.900 --> 08:39.870
You're so blind and so condescending

08:39.900 --> 08:41.669
and you're never gonna change.

08:43.770 --> 08:45.710
If you won't take yourself
seriously as an adult,

08:45.740 --> 08:48.710
then why should I care
about being your child?

08:48.750 --> 08:51.680
You want to sell The Razorback? Do it.

08:51.720 --> 08:54.720
You can't buy me off or control me anymore.

08:57.220 --> 08:59.720
Maybe what you hate about me the most

08:59.760 --> 09:01.490
is that I remind you of yourself.

09:35.690 --> 09:36.960
Keep it up, partner.

09:38.900 --> 09:40.060
You'll get there.

09:50.240 --> 09:53.410
_

10:01.740 --> 10:05.440
Is it true that you had a
Belter up on hooks for 20 hours?

10:05.480 --> 10:07.680
He's an O.P.A. smuggler and a terrorist.

10:07.710 --> 10:09.480
The Secretary-General...

10:09.510 --> 10:11.280
He didn't want to talk...

10:11.310 --> 10:13.520
The Secretary-General has
publicly disavowed gravity torture.

10:13.550 --> 10:15.020
If you want to talk to that Belter,

10:15.050 --> 10:16.420
you put him in the tank.

10:30.800 --> 10:32.330
You know who I am?

10:33.240 --> 10:35.570
I've heard of you, yes.

10:35.610 --> 10:38.310
Many interesting tales.

10:38.340 --> 10:41.240
You're well-spoken for an O.P.A. soldier.

10:41.280 --> 10:44.150
Because I'm a Belter, I'm naturally O.P.A.?

10:44.180 --> 10:46.820
I'm just a citizen of the Belt.

10:46.850 --> 10:48.550
I work for the future of my people

10:48.590 --> 10:50.320
as you do for yours.

10:50.350 --> 10:53.660
Then for the future of both our people,

10:53.690 --> 10:56.290
I need to know how you got your hands on

10:56.330 --> 10:58.630
restricted stealth technology

10:58.660 --> 11:01.000
that could destroy the
balance in the system.

11:01.030 --> 11:04.000
You mean the balance
between Earth and Mars.

11:04.030 --> 11:06.370
Either way, it's a lousy deal for Belters.

11:06.400 --> 11:09.370
The O.P.A. demands
legitimacy through violence.

11:09.410 --> 11:11.540
They haven't earned it any other way.

11:11.580 --> 11:15.510
No? You talk to me
through a piece of glass,

11:15.550 --> 11:18.280
you see my body which can no longer survive

11:18.320 --> 11:20.880
on the very planet that
bore my great-grandmother.

11:20.920 --> 11:26.490
Earth has created a race
of exiles out in space,

11:26.520 --> 11:28.890
who have no homes to return to.

11:29.730 --> 11:31.560
Should this go unanswered?

11:33.500 --> 11:35.970
I don't mean to make you afraid, madame.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.770
Have I given you the
impression that I'm afraid?

11:38.800 --> 11:43.470
Then why waste your time on a
meaningless courier like myself?

11:43.510 --> 11:45.740
You're too modest, child.

11:45.780 --> 11:50.080
Someone entrusted you to
transport pieces of the holy grail.

11:50.110 --> 11:52.250
The question is, who?

11:58.460 --> 12:01.020
There are places far worse than this.

12:02.360 --> 12:05.060
And I imagine there is a mother somewhere

12:05.100 --> 12:07.100
who'll love to see her boy again.

12:08.200 --> 12:10.330
Est cela Ã§a, madame.

12:10.370 --> 12:11.900
I understand.

12:11.940 --> 12:13.970
We all have our duty.

12:23.580 --> 12:25.970
_

12:27.830 --> 12:30.070
We've got a dead radio and
about four hours of oxygen left.

12:30.840 --> 12:32.270
Alex, how much burn do we have?

12:32.310 --> 12:35.780
I could get us maybe a third of
the way to Ganymede Station, maybe.

12:35.810 --> 12:38.080
Or get us right to the
edge of the shipping lanes,

12:38.110 --> 12:40.780
and then we'd have to pray
someone tripped over us.

12:41.280 --> 12:42.450
It won't happen.

12:42.480 --> 12:45.050
With a dead transponder,
we're just like space trash.

12:45.090 --> 12:46.320
What's wrong with the radio?

12:46.350 --> 12:48.050
Board's cooked, and I'm guessing

12:48.090 --> 12:50.320
the antenna array up
top has seen better days.

12:50.360 --> 12:52.630
See if you can improvise another board.

12:52.660 --> 12:55.460
I'm gonna go outside and see what's what.

12:55.500 --> 12:57.560
Great. We'll wait here.

12:58.800 --> 13:01.430
I don't mean to be a bad
news bull or anything, but

13:02.070 --> 13:03.340
the airlock's done.

13:04.070 --> 13:05.840
The outer door's gone.

13:07.210 --> 13:08.710
Then we'll have to vent the ship.

13:10.280 --> 13:11.780
Are you outta your tree?

13:12.750 --> 13:14.680
We'll lose all oxygen in the cabin.

13:14.710 --> 13:16.650
Everything depends on fixing that radio.

13:17.580 --> 13:18.620
We're wasting time.

13:18.650 --> 13:21.590
There you go. Calling the shots again.

13:21.620 --> 13:23.660
I'm going outside. You
got a problem with that?

13:23.690 --> 13:25.660
Amos, go with him.

13:25.690 --> 13:28.230
Whoa! Let's just hold on for one second.

13:28.900 --> 13:30.800
We don't have to go outside.

13:30.830 --> 13:33.230
We're safe right now.

13:33.670 --> 13:35.300
We open those doors, we're done.

13:35.340 --> 13:37.240
The ship could crack
apart. I'm telling you...

13:37.270 --> 13:38.940
- Shed?
- I'm just... If we open those doors...

13:38.970 --> 13:40.470
Please, just listen to me. Listen to me!

13:40.510 --> 13:42.680
If we go out there, we're gonna die.

13:42.710 --> 13:46.180
Hey, hey, hey!

13:46.210 --> 13:47.710
You're in shock. You're in shock.

13:47.750 --> 13:51.620
You know the symptoms. You know
the symptoms. Just breathe. Breathe.

13:51.650 --> 13:55.190
Deep... breathe. Breathe, breathe.

13:55.220 --> 13:56.790
All right.

14:01.870 --> 14:03.100
There.

14:03.130 --> 14:05.100
There. You chilled?

14:05.140 --> 14:06.640
Okay.

14:06.670 --> 14:08.600
Now, we're gonna go outside,

14:08.640 --> 14:10.310
and we're gonna fix the antenna,

14:10.340 --> 14:13.080
and we're gonna make some
noise and get rescued.

14:14.080 --> 14:15.680
Okay. Okay?

14:15.710 --> 14:17.080
Yeah.

14:17.110 --> 14:20.120
Watch your step, boys. We're on the way.

14:20.150 --> 14:21.680
How's it looking out there?

14:22.690 --> 14:24.320
Well, it could've been worse.

14:26.160 --> 14:28.190
It can always be worse.

14:34.130 --> 14:37.270
Okay. It's worse.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.610
Captain was pissed you weren't around.

14:45.040 --> 14:46.510
She wanted this dealt with.

14:46.540 --> 14:47.980
Yeah, it must be my week.

14:48.850 --> 14:50.310
New Earth partner.

14:51.180 --> 14:52.780
Drawing all the "hot" cases...

14:54.420 --> 14:57.020
Your attention, please.
The Air, Water and Power...

14:57.050 --> 14:58.950
Well, it's about time.

15:01.690 --> 15:03.490
Expected you an hour ago.

15:04.660 --> 15:06.530
It's a long hoof from the Medina, sir.

15:09.530 --> 15:11.370
A week ago,

15:11.400 --> 15:13.670
those dead patches started appearing.

15:13.900 --> 15:17.170
My guess is, the Greigas
are stealing water again.

15:17.210 --> 15:18.870
Some Belters clearly don't respect

15:18.910 --> 15:22.010
the green space's role in
recycling the air and the water.

15:23.250 --> 15:25.780
Not to mention the embarrassment
it causes the Governor.

15:26.820 --> 15:28.620
You seem sure it was Belters.

15:29.820 --> 15:31.620
The criminals here tend to be.

15:35.660 --> 15:37.390
You're new here, aren't you?

15:37.430 --> 15:38.790
We'll get right on that, sir.

15:39.660 --> 15:41.960
Maybe if everyone in Ceres had this view,

15:43.100 --> 15:44.570
they'd respect you more.

15:55.680 --> 15:56.680
There.

15:57.880 --> 16:00.020
Now, you can make your own view.

16:22.210 --> 16:23.540
Oh, shit!

16:34.880 --> 16:36.890
You're an Earther.

16:36.920 --> 16:39.190
And I don't even know where you're from.

16:39.220 --> 16:42.290
We're gonna be space trash in a few hours

16:42.330 --> 16:43.990
and you wanna start a friendship?

16:45.860 --> 16:46.960
If you don't think we're gonna
make it, what are you doing up here?

16:47.000 --> 16:49.670
Naomi told me to, so I am.

16:51.130 --> 16:54.140
As far as I'm concerned, she's the cap now.

17:20.560 --> 17:24.430
âª Till I lost my Clementine âª

17:24.869 --> 17:27.800
Alex, send me some juice to E-12.

17:28.810 --> 17:31.310
- âª How I missed her... âª
- Alex?

17:32.780 --> 17:34.180
Alex!

17:34.210 --> 17:36.410
Oh. E-12.

17:36.450 --> 17:37.980
Copy that.

17:38.650 --> 17:39.950
There you go, sugar.

17:39.980 --> 17:41.480
You doin' okay up there?

17:41.520 --> 17:47.820
I'm doing as good as dew on
a mornin' full of sunshine.

17:57.270 --> 17:59.030
Hey, what's the deal with you and Naomi?

17:59.070 --> 18:00.300
You two an item or something?

18:01.240 --> 18:02.700
An item?

18:10.380 --> 18:13.050
Hey, it's none of my business, but...

18:13.080 --> 18:15.350
You must think I'm
pretty stupid, don't you?

18:16.120 --> 18:17.850
I mean, you're right.

18:18.290 --> 18:21.620
I can take a core apart and put it
back together with my eyes closed.

18:21.660 --> 18:25.630
But ask me whether or not I should rip your
helmet off and kick you off this bucket,

18:26.760 --> 18:30.800
and I couldn't give you a
reason why I should or shouldn't.

18:34.370 --> 18:36.210
Except Naomi wouldn't like it.

18:43.910 --> 18:45.650
Could you pass me the drill?

18:50.620 --> 18:51.950
Thank you.

18:56.930 --> 18:58.400
âª Then I lost my Clementine âª

18:59.730 --> 19:01.500
Alex, what are you doing?

19:01.530 --> 19:04.070
I'm bringin' her home, honey-pie.

19:04.100 --> 19:06.600
- Hey.
- One more, two... and we'll be together.

19:06.640 --> 19:09.140
Just one trip to Ganymede, sweetheart.

19:09.170 --> 19:11.840
Oh, don't be like that,
sugar, I said I'm comin' home.

19:15.110 --> 19:17.610
- Alex.
- Shed, what's wrong with him?

19:17.650 --> 19:19.620
He's, uh... he's hypoxic.

19:21.420 --> 19:22.690
Oh, shit!

19:22.720 --> 19:24.350
His breather's crapping out!

19:24.760 --> 19:26.420
Damn it! How long can he hold on?

19:28.230 --> 19:30.590
Oh, oh, shit. We're losin' him!

19:30.630 --> 19:31.930
We're coming back in.

19:31.960 --> 19:34.730
Negative. We don't have
enough oxygen to vent again.

19:34.770 --> 19:37.430
Shed, take care of him! Do something!

19:39.700 --> 19:41.970
We're in a vacuum! He's in a suit! I...

19:43.610 --> 19:45.140
What do you want me to do?

19:45.710 --> 19:47.180
There's no spare!

19:47.210 --> 19:49.580
Shed, you're a medic! Act like one!

19:50.580 --> 19:52.080
Hold on, buddy.

19:52.720 --> 19:55.620
Listen, I'm hooking our breathers up, okay?

19:55.650 --> 19:57.120
So we can share air.

19:57.150 --> 19:58.920
So you can breathe off mine, okay?

19:58.960 --> 20:01.930
Shed, what's happening?

20:01.960 --> 20:05.160
Okay. Hold on, buddy. Come on.

20:08.470 --> 20:11.330
Hold on, Alex! Come on.

20:12.840 --> 20:15.870
Yeah, there it is! Breathe! Breathe, Alex!

20:15.910 --> 20:18.270
Breathe it in. Breathe.

20:21.810 --> 20:24.580
Just keep breathing. We're buddy-breathing.

20:32.360 --> 20:35.860
It's all gonna be good. It's all good.

20:35.890 --> 20:37.590
Shed, you got this?

20:37.630 --> 20:39.230
No one else dies today.

20:39.260 --> 20:41.930
If we don't get that radio
back, we all die... today.

20:42.330 --> 20:44.100
Okay, Alex. My turn, buddy.

20:46.100 --> 20:47.400
I just need a couple of breaths.

20:51.280 --> 20:53.280
Ah, that's the stuff.

20:57.820 --> 20:59.350
How's Alex doing?

20:59.380 --> 21:00.620
He's hanging in there.

21:05.760 --> 21:06.990
What does that mean?

21:07.020 --> 21:08.660
Means he's hanging in there!

21:08.690 --> 21:10.590
Get on with it. Hurry up.

21:14.900 --> 21:16.170
Don't look at it.

21:17.100 --> 21:19.200
Just think about something else, okay?

21:20.040 --> 21:22.270
Like your kid. Think about your kid.

21:24.410 --> 21:26.180
Swinging on a...

21:27.550 --> 21:29.180
Swinging on a swing or something.

21:29.880 --> 21:31.610
You're trying to distract me.

21:45.430 --> 21:46.630
Hey, guys.

21:48.970 --> 21:51.570
We're running out of...
we're running out of air.

22:02.650 --> 22:03.880
Now?

22:05.980 --> 22:07.080
No carrier.

22:07.120 --> 22:09.020
Ah, piece of shit!

22:17.760 --> 22:19.230
We have connection.

22:21.530 --> 22:23.100
Get back in here now!

22:44.990 --> 22:46.190
Come on.

22:50.360 --> 22:52.030
- Go!
- Pressurizing.

23:45.820 --> 23:48.080
Ow!

23:48.890 --> 23:50.720
What the hell did you do to me?

23:55.630 --> 23:58.090
You saved my hide, partner.

23:59.760 --> 24:01.430
You crazy son of a bitch.

24:02.630 --> 24:04.200
Ah, no problem.

24:27.960 --> 24:30.890
I need him sent to Luna
for deeper interrogations.

24:30.930 --> 24:33.200
Let the team here go another
round, they'll break him.

24:34.030 --> 24:36.260
They have a budget, it's
already shot to hell.

24:36.530 --> 24:38.870
And unlike you, I have to grovel

24:38.900 --> 24:41.070
and promise and deliver to get reappointed.

24:41.100 --> 24:43.810
This concerns me? How?

24:46.040 --> 24:49.780
You're two heartbeats away from
running the government on this planet.

24:49.810 --> 24:51.850
Yet you're accountable to
no one. How does that happen?

24:52.150 --> 24:54.920
This boy isn't some hapless smuggler.

24:55.550 --> 24:59.720
I believe the O.P.A may be
trying to obtain stealth weapons.

24:59.760 --> 25:01.460
Everything is not an O.P.A. plot

25:01.490 --> 25:03.460
and if Earth can't
afford a stealth program,

25:03.490 --> 25:05.030
how can a bunch of rock-tossers?

25:05.060 --> 25:06.330
They can't...

25:06.860 --> 25:09.460
Unless they've found
a new friend like Mars.

25:10.330 --> 25:12.070
Cold war is a bloodless war.

25:12.100 --> 25:14.600
Mutual distrust and complete co-dependence.

25:15.140 --> 25:17.210
Nobody wants to change that.

25:17.240 --> 25:19.010
Least of all Mars.

25:20.210 --> 25:21.680
That's another thing.

25:21.710 --> 25:25.950
I want every Martian weapons
facility under a microscope.

25:26.350 --> 25:27.650
They are.

25:27.680 --> 25:30.150
You know, your Belter will
like gravity on Luna better.

25:30.190 --> 25:32.520
That's the only thing he'll like.

25:32.560 --> 25:33.690
I'm afraid for him.

25:34.790 --> 25:36.760
Heaven help your enemies, Chrisjen.

25:38.330 --> 25:39.830
Heaven help us all

25:39.860 --> 25:43.000
if Mars and the Belt decide
to share a toothbrush.

25:45.070 --> 25:48.100
Bold move, I'll give him that.

25:50.140 --> 25:51.470
What?

25:53.680 --> 25:56.950
The cold war is over,
this is something new.

25:59.420 --> 26:02.990
The antenna's working but
our signal's still too weak.

26:04.490 --> 26:07.420
The transmitter was severed
from the power grid. It's done.

26:07.460 --> 26:09.430
This just keeps getting better and better.

26:10.530 --> 26:13.460
So we just blew an hour of air
for a radio that doesn't even work?

26:15.200 --> 26:17.770
Can't we rig ourselves an amplifier?

26:19.000 --> 26:20.970
We're gonna need a shitload of power.

26:21.400 --> 26:23.170
Take everything apart.

26:23.210 --> 26:26.310
Be fast and be careful, we're
inside of a limb with a pin here.

26:26.340 --> 26:28.040
If it has a battery, a power pack,

26:28.080 --> 26:30.310
any charge capability, it goes into a part.

26:40.490 --> 26:42.730
I'm sorry, does anyone
need a back rub first?

26:49.730 --> 26:51.030
Last one.

26:55.240 --> 26:56.640
Even if someone hears our SOS,

26:56.670 --> 26:58.070
they're gonna think we're pirates.

26:58.110 --> 26:59.580
Well...

27:01.210 --> 27:04.080
We're gonna just have to pray there's
another caring soul out there like Ade.

27:04.110 --> 27:07.050
Ade? She's why we're
in this shit right now.

27:07.080 --> 27:09.020
If she hadn't gone and logged
that stupid distress call...

27:09.050 --> 27:10.250
Hey!

27:10.290 --> 27:11.850
You don't know what you are talking about.

27:11.890 --> 27:13.590
You wanna keep your teeth in your mouth...

27:15.590 --> 27:16.960
We're wasting air.

27:23.870 --> 27:25.970
<i>Give me a hand over here, will you, buddy?</i>

27:26.670 --> 27:28.700
You want to unburden your soul,

27:28.740 --> 27:29.910
do it on your own time.

27:29.940 --> 27:32.440
On the remotest chance
we get out of this alive.

27:33.010 --> 27:34.910
We have enough problems right now.

27:37.210 --> 27:38.450
Yes, sir.

27:45.390 --> 27:47.820
You know that guy was telling you to go...

27:47.860 --> 27:49.360
...hump yourself.

27:49.390 --> 27:52.160
- Yeah.
- Geez... Really? I hadn't realized that.

27:53.860 --> 27:55.500
I've got plans for it, anyway.

27:56.470 --> 27:57.830
Not even gonna ask.

28:00.200 --> 28:01.570
Nice tat.

28:02.140 --> 28:04.540
Your boss lets you wear your
colors like that, out in the open?

28:05.710 --> 28:07.210
Boss has one just like it.

28:11.950 --> 28:14.550
Here's the one. Feeds the
south-east corner of the gardens.

28:14.880 --> 28:16.320
- This guy?
- Yeah.

28:25.860 --> 28:27.160
Look it, here.

28:35.470 --> 28:36.940
Sensor box should be to your right.

28:42.280 --> 28:43.550
Amateurs.

28:45.150 --> 28:47.380
But you gotta admire their
stones for hittin' the park.

28:48.990 --> 28:51.390
Where did you say this pipe diverts to?

28:51.420 --> 28:53.760
Twelfth Level, condenser
grid. It's in a warehouse.

29:09.740 --> 29:11.770
Even water like this today,

29:11.810 --> 29:13.910
Belter loader gonna want it.

29:15.350 --> 29:16.850
Huh? Hmm?

29:17.750 --> 29:19.150
Sa baka.

29:23.350 --> 29:25.020
It's good! Good.

29:25.720 --> 29:26.790
We can sell it.

29:26.820 --> 29:27.860
Let's make some money!

29:28.960 --> 29:30.330
Star Helix, don't move!

29:33.760 --> 29:36.000
Hey! Hey! Hey!

29:39.240 --> 29:40.400
Be smart.

29:42.740 --> 29:44.140
Come on, kid.

29:45.380 --> 29:46.540
Huh?

30:00.590 --> 30:02.020
Is that everything you got?

30:03.090 --> 30:04.630
Hey... Hey!

30:04.660 --> 30:06.160
Doing my work, cop.

30:07.500 --> 30:08.800
Hey, whoa, whoa!

30:11.470 --> 30:13.470
What are you punks doing
stealing up-tunnel water?

30:15.840 --> 30:17.370
Free sample.

30:17.410 --> 30:18.870
All piss and vinegar.

30:19.180 --> 30:20.680
You know, you're lucky

30:20.710 --> 30:23.280
it's us chasing you and not the Greigas.

30:23.750 --> 30:25.510
They would feed you your fingers,

30:25.550 --> 30:27.020
for playin' in their district.

30:28.690 --> 30:30.190
Greigas gone.

30:30.790 --> 30:32.050
This is our turf now.

30:32.520 --> 30:35.920
Nobody just abandons their
territory to a bunch of street punks.

30:35.960 --> 30:38.190
You see, the Greigas were smart.

30:38.230 --> 30:40.860
They'd siphon a little
water, and sell it off...

30:40.900 --> 30:42.630
Nobody's the wiser.

30:42.670 --> 30:45.300
But you, you gutter punks.

30:45.340 --> 30:47.300
You screwed the golden goose.

30:48.740 --> 30:50.270
- Mmm?
- Okay, man.

30:51.310 --> 30:53.180
Schoolin' me on gangsters, que?

30:53.210 --> 30:55.940
Yeah, dirtbag school's in session.

30:55.980 --> 30:59.920
Listen... Pick all the pockets
you want, roll drunks...

30:59.950 --> 31:02.380
But when you mess with the water,

31:02.420 --> 31:04.090
that's when you're going down.

31:07.290 --> 31:10.390
Maybe a couple of years on a
prison barge will set him straight.

31:12.100 --> 31:13.900
Huh? Would you like that?

31:14.730 --> 31:16.400
Do what you gotta do.

31:24.870 --> 31:26.110
Hey... Hey!

31:28.080 --> 31:29.680
Get out of here.

31:29.980 --> 31:31.780
Stay away from the aqua.

31:31.980 --> 31:33.450
Tell all your friends!

31:36.050 --> 31:37.390
I did not see that coming.

31:39.390 --> 31:40.390
Yeah?

31:40.790 --> 31:43.830
How about this? You see that coming?

31:46.800 --> 31:47.960
Yeah.

31:54.130 --> 31:56.390
Madam, I apologize for calling so late.

31:56.880 --> 31:58.680
There's been an incident
on the shuttle to Luna.

31:59.370 --> 32:00.610
Go on.

32:01.040 --> 32:03.340
The prisoner, Heikki
Sobong took his own life

32:03.380 --> 32:06.350
by avoiding the high-gravity
injections from his crash couch...

32:07.120 --> 32:09.420
It appears he broke free of his restraints,

32:09.450 --> 32:11.020
during the critical phase of the ascent,

32:11.050 --> 32:13.720
when he knew the guards would be
receiving their own injections.

32:14.160 --> 32:16.990
I think, madam, he is making a statement.

32:17.030 --> 32:19.530
Speak frankly, please.

32:19.560 --> 32:22.560
Earth's gravity. We used it to hurt him.

32:22.600 --> 32:24.130
He threw it back in our face.

32:41.120 --> 32:42.650
You want to clue us in?

32:42.680 --> 32:44.520
This beacon we answered
isn't pirate tech...

32:45.290 --> 32:46.920
It's top-grade military stuff.

32:47.520 --> 32:49.560
Serial stamp on the main board.

32:49.590 --> 32:51.190
Martian Congressional Navy.

32:52.760 --> 32:53.960
That makes no kind of sense.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.560
It makes all kinds of sense.

32:57.230 --> 32:59.230
That ship that attacked The Cant
wasn't tucked behind an asteroid,

32:59.270 --> 33:01.000
it was hiding in plain sight.

33:01.040 --> 33:03.540
A stealth ship... why would they
nuke a civilian ship without warning?

33:03.570 --> 33:04.970
Because they can.

33:05.510 --> 33:07.410
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- Whoa...

33:08.880 --> 33:10.280
What the hell are we tangled up in here?

33:10.310 --> 33:11.550
Who gives a shit?

33:12.380 --> 33:14.850
Let's focus on staying alive.
We'll worry about Mars later.

33:19.620 --> 33:20.890
Good so far?

33:25.930 --> 33:27.390
Good signal.

33:27.430 --> 33:29.400
We've got three hours of juice.

33:32.500 --> 33:33.770
Well...

33:34.100 --> 33:35.970
I guess all we gotta do now is

33:36.000 --> 33:39.310
pop a cold beer, and wait to be rescued.

34:00.700 --> 34:01.860
Nope.

34:01.900 --> 34:04.730
Got no record of a
Razorback on these docks.

34:04.770 --> 34:06.130
Any, um,

34:06.530 --> 34:09.840
special hangar where rich
people keep their pleasure-craft?

34:09.870 --> 34:12.570
On Ceres? Not last I heard.

34:21.320 --> 34:23.850
Now, there's a girl I'm not
gonna forget anytime soon.

34:23.880 --> 34:25.449
Yeah, why's that?

34:25.489 --> 34:28.219
Uh, few rotations back,

34:28.260 --> 34:30.420
some dock-jock was slobbering all over her

34:30.460 --> 34:32.330
while she was prepping to ship out.

34:33.060 --> 34:37.060
Eh, guy must've mistaken her
good manners for encouragement

34:37.830 --> 34:39.900
and when he laid hands on her,

34:39.929 --> 34:42.370
god damn, she planted him in the deck.

34:43.139 --> 34:44.670
That girl had skills.

34:45.510 --> 34:47.310
What ship was that?

34:50.010 --> 34:51.210
Scopuli.

34:51.250 --> 34:52.710
Dumpy old transport.

34:52.980 --> 34:55.920
No cargo, just this
young lady and a few crew.

34:56.350 --> 34:58.050
Send me the ship manifest, will you?

34:58.090 --> 35:00.050
And transponder logs, et cetera?

35:00.520 --> 35:01.990
She in some kind of trouble?

35:03.390 --> 35:05.160
I'm sure it's nothin' she can't handle.

35:43.700 --> 35:44.930
Alex?

35:49.640 --> 35:50.740
Someone heard us.

35:51.570 --> 35:53.310
- Someone heard us?
- Yeah.

35:54.540 --> 35:55.940
Are they coming?

35:56.940 --> 35:58.680
Just waiting for the bounceback.

36:09.990 --> 36:11.160
What is that?

36:11.660 --> 36:12.760
Ship en route.

36:13.860 --> 36:14.960
How far?

36:18.330 --> 36:20.270
It's almost 80,000 clicks.

36:24.670 --> 36:26.670
It's gonna be a hell of a close shave.

36:26.910 --> 36:28.210
We'll make it.

36:36.480 --> 36:38.050
What? What is it?

36:38.090 --> 36:40.590
The ship. It's Mars.

36:41.920 --> 36:43.020
What?

36:43.890 --> 36:44.890
The Donnager.

36:47.190 --> 36:48.930
The flagship of the Martian Navy.

36:51.970 --> 36:54.070
Coming to finish the job.

36:55.940 --> 36:57.840
And we just told 'em where we were.

37:22.700 --> 37:25.230
...continues to appear
for the freighter Canterbury

37:25.270 --> 37:27.270
which disappeared while
responding to a distress call.

37:27.300 --> 37:31.390
The  Canterbury was reported to be
carrying ice, bound for Ceres station.

37:31.400 --> 37:33.170
And the loss of that shipment has prompted

37:33.210 --> 37:35.940
a drastic increase in water
rationing station-wide.

37:35.980 --> 37:37.040
A spokesperson...

37:54.260 --> 37:55.960
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:34.130 --> 38:37.040
Good golly, Ms. Mao. You sure can pick 'em.

38:44.840 --> 38:46.540
Find your lost heiress yet?

38:47.600 --> 38:48.760
Well...

38:50.600 --> 38:51.930
She's not on Ceres.

38:52.970 --> 38:54.570
Shipped out on the Scopuli.

38:56.070 --> 38:58.070
It just went dark right after take-off.

38:58.770 --> 39:00.010
Vanished.

39:01.640 --> 39:03.750
The week for vanishing ships.

39:08.280 --> 39:11.320
You'd think a rich girl like her
would've had that birthmark fixed.

39:14.720 --> 39:16.590
I don't know. If it was a birthmark,

39:16.630 --> 39:18.060
her parents would have had it fixed.

39:22.030 --> 39:23.400
That's a scar.

39:25.170 --> 39:26.970
I don't think she wanted it fixed.

39:28.540 --> 39:30.010
Why do you say that?

39:30.040 --> 39:31.910
Oh, it's a badge of defiance.

39:34.610 --> 39:36.750
Against everything she's supposed to be.

39:44.050 --> 39:46.820
Wow. She tell you that herself?

39:50.130 --> 39:51.430
Yeah, she did.

40:01.800 --> 40:05.170
Listen, we're the only ones who
know what happened to the Cant.

40:06.080 --> 40:08.380
We get on that ship and chances
are we're never comin' out.

40:10.650 --> 40:11.910
Unless...

40:13.850 --> 40:14.980
What are you doing?

40:15.020 --> 40:16.690
Buying us insurance.

40:20.590 --> 40:22.220
My name is James Holden,

40:22.260 --> 40:24.690
speaking for the five
survivors of the Canterbury.

40:24.730 --> 40:28.860
Our ship was destroyed answering a
bogus SOS from a ship called the Scopuli.

40:28.900 --> 40:32.800
We recovered a false beacon and
identified it as Martian Naval technology.

40:32.840 --> 40:34.740
- It was a trap.
- Are you insane?

40:34.770 --> 40:36.810
We are about to be taken
aboard the MCRN Donnager.

40:36.840 --> 40:38.240
- Alex, shut him down!
- He's locked us out.

40:38.270 --> 40:40.080
He's locked us out! Hey, whoa, whoa!

40:40.110 --> 40:41.680
You don't speak for us.

40:42.480 --> 40:45.450
We intend to cooperate and hope
this means we won't be harmed.

40:45.480 --> 40:46.980
Should I smoke him?

40:49.550 --> 40:50.820
Say the word.

40:53.520 --> 40:54.920
We're dead anyway.

40:59.760 --> 41:04.500
Any such action will only confirm that
the Canterbury was destroyed by Mars.

41:17.080 --> 41:22.050
It just needs to reach one ship,
one station. Then it'll spread.

41:22.080 --> 41:23.320
Don't count on it.

41:27.620 --> 41:29.220
Their jammers were in range.

42:31.450 --> 42:34.190
You are prisoners of the
Mars Congressional Republic.

42:34.220 --> 42:35.760
Move and you die.
