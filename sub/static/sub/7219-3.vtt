00:01.169 --> 00:03.477
<i>Previously on</i> Justified...

00:03.537 --> 00:05.608
Are you a lawyer or...

00:05.705 --> 00:07.481
I'm Loretta's social worker.

00:07.541 --> 00:09.350
At least
you're not feeding me bullshit to get laid.

00:09.443 --> 00:10.945
I was just about to get to that.

00:11.011 --> 00:14.015
You and your property are seized
till the court makes its determination.

00:14.114 --> 00:16.458
I want these cuffs off
and you people out of my house.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.793
All this for doing Detroit's dirty laundry.

00:18.852 --> 00:21.560
I'm afraid Florida's
tapped out for the Crowes.

00:21.655 --> 00:22.861
Do you have a Cousin Dewey in Kentucky?

00:23.657 --> 00:26.297
- Darryl.
- It's good to see you, Cousin Dewey.

00:27.160 --> 00:28.230
Were you there when it happened?

00:28.896 --> 00:30.307
It was Crowder, wasn't it?

00:30.364 --> 00:32.344
Is this the man who assaulted your husband?

00:34.301 --> 00:35.712
Like I said, it's not him.

00:35.802 --> 00:38.715
Lee will never again
be the man that I married.

00:38.805 --> 00:40.045
So I'm in a tough spot.

00:40.140 --> 00:41.312
You want that money.

00:41.375 --> 00:44.322
$300,000 and I'm gone.

00:44.578 --> 00:46.558
I am here to tell you that everything is fine

00:46.647 --> 00:48.649
and that the new shipment
will be here very soon.

00:48.715 --> 00:49.887
I need to know when.

00:49.983 --> 00:51.223
Day after tomorrow.

00:51.318 --> 00:53.229
They hit our damn shipment.

00:53.921 --> 00:54.922
Clean it up.

00:55.155 --> 00:56.156
All of it.

00:57.491 --> 00:59.562
I'm gonna ask you one time.

01:00.594 --> 01:02.164
Did you rip me off?

01:02.229 --> 01:04.230
<i>I'm not sure I like your tone, Boyd.</i>

01:04.331 --> 01:07.005
Well, then, let me repeat the question.

01:07.334 --> 01:11.248
- Did you rip me off?
- No.

01:11.605 --> 01:14.211
You see, I believe
instead of wasting time accusing each other,

01:14.274 --> 01:16.117
we should focus on getting our shit back.

01:16.710 --> 01:18.189
Now, other than us,
the only people who knew

01:18.245 --> 01:20.122
the shipment was
coming in tonight were Mikey,

01:20.414 --> 01:24.123
<i>your two shitheads,
and that unwashed roomful of corner boys.</i>

01:25.018 --> 01:27.259
<i>Does anybody jump out at you?</i>

01:27.955 --> 01:29.764
Let me call you back.

01:51.311 --> 01:52.585
- What's up, Art?
- What?

01:52.646 --> 01:53.784
<i>Did I catch you working out?</i>

01:53.880 --> 01:55.416
No. Bowling.

01:55.716 --> 01:59.459
Well, Monroe's gonna
have his bail hearing tomorrow morning.

01:59.553 --> 02:02.932
Chances are he's gonna
get kicked out on his own recognisance.

02:02.990 --> 02:04.936
Apparently, the case is already falling apart.

02:05.325 --> 02:07.134
<i>Well, you do understand
what that means, right?</i>

02:07.227 --> 02:08.170
I'm sorry?

02:08.261 --> 02:10.935
<i>I said you do understand
what that means, right?</i>

02:10.997 --> 02:14.002
Yeah. You're saying
that Monroe gets out in the morning

02:14.101 --> 02:16.103
and I should be ready
in case he shows up here.

02:16.403 --> 02:17.814
Well, it wouldn't be the first time

02:17.904 --> 02:19.941
that a guy celebrated getting out on bail

02:20.007 --> 02:23.079
by taking a shot
at the marshal living in his house.

02:24.077 --> 02:25.488
<i>Especially if he kills you.</i>

02:25.579 --> 02:27.286
On second thought, just forget I called.

02:28.015 --> 02:29.016
Funny.

02:37.290 --> 02:38.291
What?

02:38.358 --> 02:40.099
You do know I'm a United States Marshal.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.798
Well, maybe I have a prescription.

02:41.862 --> 02:43.500
Do they even give those in this state?

02:43.597 --> 02:44.701
No.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.011
Just to take the edge off.

02:48.101 --> 02:50.843
Sure doing what you do,
you must run into some pretty awful shit.

02:52.205 --> 02:53.343
It's not so bad as you think.

02:53.940 --> 02:55.886
The truth is the hardest part's knowing

02:55.976 --> 02:57.478
when I pull that kid from a home,

02:57.544 --> 02:59.854
I'm responsible
for the worst day of that kid's life.

02:59.946 --> 03:01.653
I don't want to be contrary,

03:01.715 --> 03:04.457
but that sounds
every bit as bad as I think people imagine.

03:04.951 --> 03:07.488
- What about you?
- What about me?

03:09.056 --> 03:12.003
Doing what you do,
you must run into your share of awfulness,

03:12.059 --> 03:13.868
make you see things you can't unsee.

03:15.128 --> 03:17.074
Time to time, I suppose.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.068
What do you do to take the edge off?

03:43.156 --> 03:47.002
The downside of these high-end alarms
with those shock sensors,

03:47.394 --> 03:49.840
neighbourhood punks
decide they want to have fun with you,

03:49.896 --> 03:52.740
all they got to do is
run up and smack the bumper.

03:52.833 --> 03:54.437
When I was a kid, we'd just

03:55.035 --> 03:57.879
ring a guy's doorbell, run like hell.

03:57.938 --> 03:58.939
Ding-dong ditch.

03:59.039 --> 04:02.452
It ended for me the day Mose Sawyer
came to his door with a scatter gun.

04:02.542 --> 04:04.579
Some guys just can't take a joke.

04:04.678 --> 04:06.749
I was about to outgrow it, anyway.

04:06.847 --> 04:09.293
Kind of thing
you drop as soon as you discover girls.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.753
Yet here you are, all growed up,

04:12.853 --> 04:15.356
still dinging and donging and
don't have the sense to ditch.

04:15.789 --> 04:18.099
I never said I was the one
that set your car going.

04:18.524 --> 04:20.129
It's not my car.

04:20.694 --> 04:21.866
Who's it belong to, then?

04:22.429 --> 04:24.204
The man this house belongs to...

04:24.631 --> 04:26.042
Same one who sent you here.

04:26.266 --> 04:31.079
Now, why on earth would
anybody send little old me?

04:31.271 --> 04:33.046
Scare me to death, I suppose.

04:36.209 --> 04:38.712
Just so everything is out in the open.

04:39.212 --> 04:41.214
Less chance somebody
makes a mistake that way.

04:42.415 --> 04:44.725
You're a cop? KSP?

04:45.919 --> 04:47.330
Still pretending like you don't know.

04:48.455 --> 04:49.763
Unless Monroe didn't tell you.

04:51.825 --> 04:53.668
So, what is this place,

04:53.760 --> 04:57.003
somewhere you just
bring girls and bang 'em?

04:57.097 --> 04:58.940
Mind if I give you some advice?

04:58.999 --> 05:00.637
You got one in there right now.

05:01.234 --> 05:03.578
Why don't you walk away,

05:03.904 --> 05:05.747
tell Monroe I wouldn't scare,

05:06.173 --> 05:08.084
and if he wants me out of his house so bad,

05:08.141 --> 05:09.745
he should come over here his own self.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.451
Now, who's Monroe?

05:12.579 --> 05:14.354
All right, easy, now.

05:14.447 --> 05:16.120
I'll be on my way.

05:16.449 --> 05:19.089
I can tell you're all anxious to get back to it.

05:19.452 --> 05:21.159
Can't say I blame you.

05:21.254 --> 05:24.098
Dear Lord, she must be some kind of piece.

05:26.660 --> 05:30.472
Get me out here again,
you best remember to ditch.

05:35.502 --> 05:36.537
What was it?

05:37.370 --> 05:38.440
On the fritz.

05:38.772 --> 05:41.616
You're not gonna believe this. I have to go.

05:44.044 --> 05:45.182
What?

06:10.537 --> 06:15.316
JUSTIFIED

06:16.843 --> 06:19.084
All right, buddy. Talk to you later.

06:20.881 --> 06:23.020
You here to drop off my keys?

06:23.083 --> 06:26.064
Making bail's got no effect
on your property seizure.

06:26.152 --> 06:29.861
I thought your lawyer explained all that,
amount you're paying him.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.903
Yeah, I didn't have to put up bail.

06:31.992 --> 06:35.166
- I got out on my own recognisance.
- Congratulations.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.572
Yeah. Prosecutor didn't even mind.

06:37.664 --> 06:40.611
Seems like you're the only one that
doesn't know this case is bullshit.

06:40.700 --> 06:43.704
It's not that I don't know
so much as I just don't care.

06:43.770 --> 06:46.376
Yeah, that's why you're waiting out here
for me, 'cause you don't care.

06:46.439 --> 06:47.679
I don't care about your case.

06:48.008 --> 06:51.182
What I do care about is you not sending
any more shitkickers to your house,

06:51.244 --> 06:53.224
interrupting my evening.

06:54.614 --> 06:56.059
Something happened at my house?

06:56.116 --> 07:00.087
Set off your car alarm to draw me outside,
as I imagine you told him to do.

07:00.420 --> 07:03.731
Gave the girl I was with
enough time to come 10 her senses.

07:03.857 --> 07:05.928
Before you send him again,
make sure he's a guy

07:06.026 --> 07:07.562
you want holding your life in his hands,

07:07.627 --> 07:10.267
'cause anything he does
will come back to you.

07:10.363 --> 07:12.036
He gets put down,

07:12.732 --> 07:14.541
you'd be looking at felony murder.

07:15.235 --> 07:16.270
Funny, huh?

07:16.369 --> 07:18.212
If he dies, you'd be on the hook for murder...

07:18.271 --> 07:19.875
How it works.

07:19.940 --> 07:24.150
This guy, did he do anything else?

07:24.244 --> 07:28.215
Next time, why not just
out out the middleman and do it yourself,

07:28.281 --> 07:30.761
make the most of that recognisance?

07:31.785 --> 07:34.231
You know, I didn't always
used to be a finance guy.

07:34.487 --> 07:37.627
I know.
First few arrests were for assault with intent,

07:37.724 --> 07:40.295
collection of debts by extortionate means.

07:40.393 --> 07:41.895
That's correct.

07:43.229 --> 07:44.606
You want that to impress me?

07:44.664 --> 07:47.474
No. I just wanted to let you know

07:47.567 --> 07:50.776
that if I were to come looking for you,

07:50.837 --> 07:52.612
it wouldn't be to set off a car alarm.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.914
Well, you know where to find me.

08:02.282 --> 08:05.024
Lee, where I'm from, you go to the police,

08:05.118 --> 08:08.099
your family finds you
cut up into pieces in a plastic bag.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.961
Yeah, but Mooney works for me.

08:11.024 --> 08:13.300
Really? Then why does he threaten me?

08:13.360 --> 08:16.341
Why does he throw me out of the car
and puts a gun to my face?

08:16.429 --> 08:17.430
Listen to me.

08:18.098 --> 08:20.044
The doctors told me
you might never wake up.

08:20.633 --> 08:23.204
How was I to know that I'm going to be
safe without your protection?

08:23.436 --> 08:24.710
That is bullshit.

08:24.971 --> 08:26.450
Please don't tell me
you're buying into her crap.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.851
This woman is obviously terrified.

08:30.310 --> 08:32.187
She's not used to this kind of business,

08:32.278 --> 08:34.884
and then you scare
the shit out of her like that!

08:35.948 --> 08:39.294
From now on, your number-one job
is to make sure she's safe.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.729
And where does that leave us with Crowder?

08:41.221 --> 08:44.464
Half a dozen of my deputies
witness her tell me that he is not the guy.

08:44.958 --> 08:47.063
Any ID that she makes now will
get laughed out of court.

08:47.160 --> 08:50.004
Well, Mr Crowder's not gonna go to court.

08:50.864 --> 08:51.865
What?

08:52.332 --> 08:54.175
You're just gonna let him skate?

08:54.234 --> 08:56.145
No. I want you to kill him.

09:02.242 --> 09:04.415
Get the hell off of me, man! Jesus.

09:04.511 --> 09:05.512
Pardon me!

09:05.578 --> 09:06.852
Move your ass, god damn it!

09:06.913 --> 09:08.551
Come on! Come on!

09:09.883 --> 09:11.328
Get off!

09:17.257 --> 09:18.895
Well, shit, Boyd.

09:20.393 --> 09:24.239
You want to tell me why you had Captain
Fauxhawk drag me all the way over here?

09:24.330 --> 09:25.707
We have a problem, Cyrus.

09:25.765 --> 09:26.937
Hoping maybe you could help.

09:27.033 --> 09:29.104
Yeah, well, I hope
that problem doesn't have anything to do

09:29.202 --> 09:31.580
with a certain
service you say will be restored.

09:31.671 --> 09:33.048
Is that a BB gun?

09:33.106 --> 09:34.176
He had it with him.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.516
The more you pump, the harder it shoots?

09:36.576 --> 09:38.078
Ain't you never seen a airgun?

09:39.446 --> 09:40.925
Jesus, man!

09:42.248 --> 09:43.352
You almost took out my eye!

09:43.416 --> 09:44.520
Yeah, I know. I missed.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.729
The hell's wrong with you, man?

09:49.789 --> 09:53.931
My colleague is apoplectic at the part you
played in the loss of our product.

09:54.027 --> 09:55.597
The loss of... Jesus!

09:55.695 --> 10:00.474
I, on the other hand, understand you must
have been an unwitting accomplice,

10:01.134 --> 10:04.581
'cause you ain't stupid enough
to think you can rip me off

10:04.637 --> 10:07.049
and remain on this side
of the goddamn planet!

10:07.874 --> 10:09.080
Jesus Christ, man!

10:09.142 --> 10:11.144
So what I need from you right now, son,

10:11.611 --> 10:15.991
is to tell me who she is.

10:16.549 --> 10:17.892
Boyd, I don't know what you mean right now.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.828
Whoever you told about the shipment.

10:19.919 --> 10:22.399
And I say "she" 'cause I'm giving you
the benefit of the doubt.

10:23.423 --> 10:24.902
Come on, now, son.

10:25.325 --> 10:27.236
Pussy is a powerful thing.

10:34.567 --> 10:35.910
She calls herself "Candy,"

10:36.169 --> 10:40.117
but that just might be on account of
this little trick she does where she just...

10:40.240 --> 10:41.480
This better be important.

10:41.641 --> 10:44.622
It's that Russian lady.
She says it's an emergency.

10:47.580 --> 10:48.991
You're taking the call?

10:49.082 --> 10:50.186
It is important.

10:50.583 --> 10:54.531
Cyrus, in my absence,
I encourage you to tell Mr Duffy

10:54.621 --> 10:59.195
everything you know
about Miss Candy and her bag of tricks.

10:59.859 --> 11:01.031
Don't worry, Cyrus.

11:02.795 --> 11:04.138
God damn!

11:04.330 --> 11:06.776
Miss Mara, at the risk of being rude,

11:06.833 --> 11:09.279
do you really think
it's smart for you to be calling my bar?

11:09.602 --> 11:10.603
Ear.

11:11.504 --> 11:12.847
God damn!

11:12.939 --> 11:13.940
I see.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.147
He sent some asshole to muscle me.

11:16.209 --> 11:17.654
I'm supposed to just sit still?

11:17.710 --> 11:20.281
He told you specifically
that it was Monroe that sent him?

11:20.346 --> 11:22.724
He didn't say it wasn't.
Who else is it gonna be?

11:22.815 --> 11:25.853
What I'm really wondering
is before Monroe's lawyer called that judge

11:25.952 --> 11:27.192
and started screaming "harassment,"

11:27.287 --> 11:29.961
were you planning
on telling me about any of this?

11:30.723 --> 11:33.135
- You have your "go" bag in the car?
- Always.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.194
- Good.
- Art.

11:34.294 --> 11:35.705
You're gonna be moving
into the Monroe house.

11:35.795 --> 11:37.035
That's not necessary.

11:37.130 --> 11:38.700
The golden boy's being evicted?

11:38.798 --> 11:40.505
No, nobody's being evicted.

11:40.633 --> 11:43.807
Time being, you two are gonna live together,
watch each other's backs.

11:44.971 --> 11:46.416
He didn't even have a gun.

11:46.506 --> 11:48.315
He didn't show you a gun.

11:49.075 --> 11:50.554
Raylan, come on.

11:50.643 --> 11:52.748
This guy comes back,
you know he's gonna come heavy.

11:52.845 --> 11:54.153
Things go south, can you imagine

11:54.214 --> 11:57.058
the shitstorm I'd be under
if I ignored a warning sign?

11:57.150 --> 11:58.993
So now I got a chaperone.

11:59.886 --> 12:02.389
We call it "backup," Raylan.

12:02.488 --> 12:05.264
A chaperone is what you would have if, say,

12:05.358 --> 12:08.430
I thought you were using the Monroe house
for personal business,

12:08.528 --> 12:10.064
but, of course, that's ridiculous,

12:10.163 --> 12:11.904
'cause, of course, I know you understand

12:11.998 --> 12:14.069
that the shitstorm I was talking about before

12:14.167 --> 12:16.169
would be nothing
compared to what would happen

12:16.236 --> 12:19.183
if, say, a civilian
got hurt at a property that we owned.

12:21.241 --> 12:24.120
Call me if you're gonna be late for supper.

12:36.623 --> 12:38.102
Hear my daddy tell it,

12:38.191 --> 12:41.035
you'd have thought
Harlan County was hell on Earth.

12:41.094 --> 12:45.270
When I woke up here this morning, though,
I never saw so much green.

12:46.399 --> 12:48.276
Man could get used to living like this.

12:48.368 --> 12:50.245
How long you planning to stay,
Cousin Darryl?

12:50.737 --> 12:54.150
Cousin Dewey, if I didn't know better,
I'd think you don't want me 'round here.

12:54.474 --> 12:56.283
No, of course not.

12:56.376 --> 12:58.253
It's just... I just...

12:58.311 --> 13:01.656
What are the feds gonna do when
they find out you broke your probation?

13:02.115 --> 13:06.393
Even if they knew I left Florida,
only way they'd know to find me here

13:06.452 --> 13:08.898
is if someone told them where to look.

13:09.722 --> 13:11.724
That's not the only way.

13:12.892 --> 13:16.635
You remember Raylan Givens?
He said he sent you to Starke?

13:16.729 --> 13:18.731
Well, he's assigned to Kentucky now.

13:18.798 --> 13:22.075
He's always poking around down here
on one thing and another,

13:22.135 --> 13:23.307
smacking everybody.

13:23.403 --> 13:26.282
Cousin Dewey,
you're worrying about me like you my bitch.

13:29.075 --> 13:30.145
You my bitch?

13:31.010 --> 13:32.853
No, I'm not your bitch.

13:32.945 --> 13:34.583
Okay, 'cause my probation's over

13:34.647 --> 13:38.686
on account of me helping Raylan Givens
apprehend a notorious fugitive.

13:38.918 --> 13:42.957
That means I'm free
to come and go as I please.

13:44.857 --> 13:46.359
You came here.

13:47.293 --> 13:49.500
- Figured you could use some help.
- With what?

13:49.595 --> 13:51.336
Hey, girl. Hey!

13:51.431 --> 13:54.002
<i>"Café con leche"</i>
don't just mean "coffee with milk."

13:54.100 --> 13:55.374
You got to stir it, steam it.

13:55.468 --> 13:57.345
What is it you think I need help with?

14:00.106 --> 14:01.813
Managing your new fortune.

14:04.143 --> 14:05.486
How did you hear about that?

14:05.611 --> 14:08.615
See, when I was locked down at Starke,
Hook a bunch of classes...

14:09.115 --> 14:12.289
Business administration,
accounting, real estate.

14:12.352 --> 14:13.490
Took one in composition,

14:13.553 --> 14:15.555
which I don't think will come into play,
but you never know.

14:15.655 --> 14:16.725
I appreciate the thought and all...

14:16.823 --> 14:17.961
You ain't got to thank me.

14:22.395 --> 14:25.239
How much y'all make in here,
week over week?

14:28.801 --> 14:30.144
Five, six.

14:32.472 --> 14:33.974
Y'all make 300 grand a year?

14:34.307 --> 14:37.151
Four or five. No, five... Five, six

14:38.144 --> 14:39.179
hundred.

14:39.245 --> 14:40.246
Is that right?

14:42.682 --> 14:46.220
Yeah... There's a lot of expenses,
taking care of whores.

14:46.319 --> 14:47.764
Yeah? Who told you that?

14:47.854 --> 14:49.834
The fella you bought from?

14:49.889 --> 14:51.596
What's his name? Beard? Bird?

14:51.691 --> 14:53.034
- Boyd.
- Boyd.

14:53.092 --> 14:54.571
Boyd Crowder.

14:54.994 --> 14:57.338
- How much you pay him?
$250,000.

14:57.497 --> 14:59.568
$250,000?

14:59.932 --> 15:02.435
God damn, Dewey! You got ripped off!

15:02.668 --> 15:04.614
Look, right here in the classifieds,

15:04.704 --> 15:08.584
there's a fully equipped
and liquor-licensed restaurant in Corbin

15:08.674 --> 15:12.087
going for a buck 25, and it has kerb appeal!

15:12.178 --> 15:13.714
You ain't got no kerb appeal up in here!

15:13.780 --> 15:14.781
What's kerb appeal?

15:14.881 --> 15:16.690
Damn, Dewey! You done got ripped off!

15:17.016 --> 15:18.120
Damn!

15:21.087 --> 15:22.862
Look, I know you don't want me here.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.799
No, I never said that.

15:25.291 --> 15:27.703
It's okay. It's okay.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.430
All right? You got your own thing.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.305
You want to be left to it, right, big man?

15:33.399 --> 15:35.902
So, why don't you go and talk to Boyd

15:35.968 --> 15:38.608
and tell him that
your real-estate consultant has determined

15:38.704 --> 15:41.116
that you overpaid, all right?

15:42.041 --> 15:45.750
And you expect him
to return you $100,000 of that $250,000.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.449
I'm gonna take half for my time and expertise,

15:49.816 --> 15:51.955
and you'll see my taillights.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.990
How's that sound, big man?

15:57.557 --> 15:58.729
Okay.

16:04.897 --> 16:06.774
This make sense to you?

16:07.333 --> 16:08.334
You know, it doesn't.

16:08.434 --> 16:10.141
Art's the one that thinks you need to be here.

16:10.336 --> 16:13.283
No, I mean Monroe sending a guy.

16:13.339 --> 16:15.751
Could he really think
he'd make us move out of his house?

16:15.842 --> 16:17.753
Maybe he sent him to be an asshole.

16:17.844 --> 16:20.120
You do bring it out in people.

16:20.179 --> 16:22.455
But I'll try not to cramp your style.
Don't worry.

16:22.515 --> 16:23.926
It's not that.

16:24.317 --> 16:27.594
So I guess the blonde at the door
isn't here to see you.

16:31.791 --> 16:34.294
It's Loretta McCready's case worker.

16:36.863 --> 16:40.310
I guess it's not such a good idea,
me showing up here.

16:41.534 --> 16:43.639
I thought you said
you had the place to yourself.

16:43.703 --> 16:44.875
I did.

16:45.304 --> 16:46.544
That car alarm last night.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.049
You said it was on the fritz.

16:48.608 --> 16:52.852
I didn't want to kill your buzz, so to speak.

16:54.280 --> 16:57.784
There was a guy out here setting it off,
hitting the bumper with a bat.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.558
Seems pretty clear
it was the owner who sent him.

17:00.653 --> 17:04.567
Under the circumstances,
my boss doesn't want anyone here alone.

17:05.191 --> 17:07.329
So, when you say "a bat,"
you mean a baseball bat?

17:07.393 --> 17:09.669
Don't mean the kind with wings.

17:10.530 --> 17:14.478
This guy, did he have
a shamrock tattooed on his neck?

17:16.035 --> 17:18.310
Please tell me that was a lucky guess.

17:24.477 --> 17:25.819
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.049
Look, I ain't got a lot of time.

17:31.851 --> 17:33.330
I got robbed last night.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.059
I don't want to go into the details,

17:35.154 --> 17:38.567
but I'm looking
for the person who I think is responsible.

17:38.658 --> 17:39.762
Now, her name is Candy.

17:40.593 --> 17:43.096
Now, Cyrus... You remember Cyrus?

17:43.329 --> 17:47.175
Now, Cyrus said
this girl used ice on him, breath mints.

17:48.067 --> 17:51.014
Said she did things
they ain't even got names for.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.743
Now, I know
we had a couple of girls at Audrey's

17:52.838 --> 17:54.840
used to specialise in stuff like this.

17:56.542 --> 17:58.715
Ava, is any of this ringing a bell?

17:58.778 --> 18:01.258
Why? Are you looking for a blowjob?

18:02.548 --> 18:04.357
Baby, I'm looking to find out who robbed me.

18:04.951 --> 18:07.022
You mean who robbed us, don't you?

18:07.086 --> 18:09.396
Ava, what do you want from me?

18:10.022 --> 18:12.434
Well, I want you to ask me
how I'm doing in here.

18:12.525 --> 18:14.436
I want you to tell me what
you're doing to get me out.

18:14.527 --> 18:17.599
Well, it's best, honey,
if you don't know the details.

18:18.698 --> 18:20.439
Which details, Boyd?

18:21.200 --> 18:22.543
How you couldn't bribe a judge?

18:23.869 --> 18:28.079
Or how you nearly killed the one man
whose testimony we needed changed?

18:30.309 --> 18:33.586
Maybe I really am better off counting on him.

18:33.646 --> 18:34.920
You take those things off again,

18:34.981 --> 18:37.291
I'm gonna staple them
to your goddamn head. Turn around.

18:43.055 --> 18:44.830
I'm doing everything I can for you.

18:45.057 --> 18:46.968
There ain't no legal way
to get you out of this.

18:47.727 --> 18:50.333
The things they charged you with,
it ain't like they got it wrong.

18:50.429 --> 18:51.965
You told me to move that body.

18:52.064 --> 18:53.941
I didn't tell you to do it alone,

18:54.000 --> 18:55.240
to kick Jimmy out of the truck.

18:56.102 --> 18:57.445
So all this, ifs my fault?

18:59.238 --> 19:00.615
I didn't kill Delroy.

19:09.315 --> 19:10.453
That was all me.

19:13.953 --> 19:15.296
We're done.

19:17.256 --> 19:18.291
Ava.

19:23.029 --> 19:24.474
I still need to find that girl.

19:27.600 --> 19:30.012
<i>Lions choose the coolest hour to hunt...</i>

19:40.212 --> 19:42.556
Carry this with you everywhere?

19:42.648 --> 19:45.686
Smart. Guy with your record
gets stopped with a gun...

19:45.785 --> 19:47.958
Knife even... He's going away.

19:49.121 --> 19:52.898
But this thing, well, you could
do as much damage in the right hands,

19:52.992 --> 19:56.804
but you get stopped with it, you just say
you're on the way to the batting cages.

19:59.065 --> 20:00.476
Why don't you stay down there, Henry?

20:01.133 --> 20:02.510
How did you find me?

20:02.702 --> 20:03.806
Come on.

20:03.869 --> 20:05.507
A smart fellow like you can figure it out.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.642
That bitch saw me last night?

20:09.875 --> 20:11.411
Just when I...

20:12.478 --> 20:14.822
That was my fault.
I should have been clearer.

20:15.314 --> 20:18.727
Standing up ain't
the only way to get me to take this bat to you.

20:18.818 --> 20:20.491
Calling her a bitch will gel us there, too.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.533
Did she even tell you what she did to me?

20:23.589 --> 20:25.728
She told me she put
Henry Junior in foster care

20:25.825 --> 20:28.829
after LPD found crystals of your meth
mixed in with his G.l. Joes.

20:28.894 --> 20:31.170
That's bullshit. That bi...

20:37.837 --> 20:42.217
Ms Brander planted that shit
to give her a reason to take him away.

20:43.209 --> 20:45.018
Are you saying you didn't cook meth?

20:45.277 --> 20:47.348
What I'm saying is
I never brought that shit home.

20:47.413 --> 20:48.892
I'm a pro.

20:48.948 --> 20:52.259
She must have had it on her
when she came by on her wellness check.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.587
And why was she checking wellness?

20:55.187 --> 20:58.464
Is that 'cause Junior's kindergarten teacher
was concerned about his bruises?

20:58.557 --> 21:00.264
Well, that was his mama's fault.

21:01.026 --> 21:04.405
She got back on the pipe,
she got all high-strung.

21:04.463 --> 21:07.410
She kicked it again after that, for a while.

21:07.733 --> 21:09.041
Then Henry got taken.

21:09.935 --> 21:13.576
And in your mind, this is all Alison's fault?

21:13.739 --> 21:17.118
She took three years away from me,
sent my kid to live with strangers.

21:17.209 --> 21:18.244
Yeah, I blame her.

21:18.310 --> 21:19.550
She's not your problem, Henry.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.785
She didn't plant drugs in my house,

21:21.881 --> 21:23.792
change the course of my life?

21:23.983 --> 21:27.726
Whatever she did, she didn't do it to you.

21:28.754 --> 21:31.291
She did it 'cause she thought
it was the best way to do her job.

21:32.057 --> 21:35.129
Now, I know you're hurting, but if you ever
want to see Henry Junior again,

21:35.461 --> 21:37.065
even just talking to him,

21:37.463 --> 21:39.773
you got to spend
less time screwing up other people's lives

21:39.832 --> 21:40.970
and more fixing your own.

21:41.167 --> 21:42.339
Well, that's just perfect.

21:42.635 --> 21:45.081
Make one hell of a bumper sticker.

21:48.674 --> 21:50.984
You do what you want with your life,

21:51.076 --> 21:54.990
but you come near Alison again,
best-case scenario, you end up in jail...

21:55.614 --> 21:57.093
And that's best-case.

22:05.024 --> 22:06.162
I missed you.

22:06.258 --> 22:09.171
Yeah? Really?

22:10.095 --> 22:11.768
I was only gone... What was it?

22:12.431 --> 22:13.808
Two whole days?

22:13.866 --> 22:17.143
I know, but I thought
they was gonna let you out in two hours.

22:17.203 --> 22:19.274
Yeah, well, that's the deal,
you get busted on the weekend,

22:19.338 --> 22:21.841
they got to hold you
till the judge comes in on Monday.

22:22.107 --> 22:25.054
And they just expect me
to get by without it all that time?

22:26.779 --> 22:30.386
Maybe they thought
you'd get one of them Mandingos

22:30.482 --> 22:32.484
you grew up with
to come and help you pass the time.

22:34.119 --> 22:36.326
What did I tell you about that shit?

22:36.889 --> 22:38.960
Louisville's not that long a drive.

22:39.191 --> 22:41.637
I bet you make one phone call home,

22:41.694 --> 22:44.538
half the jimmies in Smoketown
will be jumping in their escalades,

22:44.630 --> 22:46.473
racing to get to you first.

22:46.832 --> 22:50.837
I swear, I don't know why you have to
be such an asshole sometimes.

22:50.903 --> 22:53.247
Did you offer him anything else?

22:53.873 --> 22:55.409
I don't even know who you mean.

22:56.809 --> 22:58.584
Your Smoketown jimmy.

23:00.012 --> 23:03.323
Did you offer him some green
to go along with the pink?

23:03.382 --> 23:05.726
Baby, if you're joking, I'm not.

23:08.020 --> 23:10.330
Man came to my house last night,

23:10.923 --> 23:14.029
drew the marshal
that was staying there outside.

23:15.527 --> 23:16.835
Okay. So?

23:17.930 --> 23:19.409
So, you break into a house like mine,

23:19.498 --> 23:23.378
you either got to know how to
bypass the maximum-security codes

23:24.036 --> 23:27.779
or you got to be able
to draw the person standing there out.

23:28.040 --> 23:29.110
And you risk a thing like that,

23:29.208 --> 23:32.917
you'd better know there's something
inside that's worth your while.

23:33.012 --> 23:36.391
And exactly how to get to it and to get it,

23:37.750 --> 23:40.128
all before the marshal has time...

23:40.219 --> 23:42.631
- But...
- ...to come back in and close the door.

23:55.968 --> 23:58.710
Baby, I don't know what you're thinking.

23:59.138 --> 24:01.277
Doesn't matter what I'm thinking.

24:01.373 --> 24:06.914
What matters is
I can't think of anyone but you and me

24:07.880 --> 24:09.917
who knows where that golds at.

24:11.650 --> 24:13.391
And such a betrayal.

24:52.758 --> 24:54.431
- Duffy...
- Say what?

24:56.095 --> 24:58.268
Wasn't Duffy the one who put the safe in?

24:59.465 --> 25:00.500
Duffy.

25:00.599 --> 25:02.044
He didn't know what was in it.

25:02.334 --> 25:05.338
But he knew it was valuable enough
that you needed a hidden safe.

25:06.605 --> 25:08.346
Please, baby, I swear.

25:10.342 --> 25:11.446
I swear.

25:12.878 --> 25:14.186
It's all right. I believe you.

25:15.447 --> 25:17.552
I just wish you'd been
more cooperative in the first place

25:17.649 --> 25:19.890
instead of getting all argumentative.

25:19.985 --> 25:22.192
Would have saved us both a lot of trouble.

25:28.694 --> 25:30.970
I'm gonna need you to go in and get it for me.

25:34.833 --> 25:37.541
Were you not listening just now
when I told you I went to see him,

25:37.636 --> 25:39.309
told him what would happen
if he ever came back?

25:39.471 --> 25:41.542
The guy Little Miss Sunshine
planted meth on.

25:41.640 --> 25:42.641
What's that matter?

25:42.741 --> 25:43.879
You ask her about it?

25:44.043 --> 25:45.249
When have I had the time?

25:47.813 --> 25:49.918
What if she were a criminal?

25:50.149 --> 25:52.151
Alison? She's not.

25:52.651 --> 25:55.188
Smokes weed in front of you,
plants meth on an innocent man,

25:55.254 --> 25:56.733
but still she's a good girl?

25:56.822 --> 25:58.392
I wouldn't call Henry innocent,

25:58.490 --> 25:59.901
and none of that makes her a criminal.

25:59.992 --> 26:01.198
Let me rephrase the question.

26:01.260 --> 26:03.433
If she were a criminal, what would you do?

26:03.929 --> 26:05.101
What do you mean, "What would I do?"

26:05.197 --> 26:06.232
What do you think I would do?

26:06.331 --> 26:07.332
I don't know, Raylan.

26:07.599 --> 26:09.101
Way you've been managing your life lately,

26:09.201 --> 26:10.737
that's a question I've stopped asking.

26:10.836 --> 26:12.873
So, are you gonna answer the door, or am I?

26:13.672 --> 26:14.946
Where are you going with all this?

26:17.743 --> 26:19.552
Guy gets you outside.

26:19.912 --> 26:22.085
Maybe he's giving his partner time

26:22.181 --> 26:24.422
to take whatever it is they came here for.

26:24.516 --> 26:26.462
You think Alison's trying
to rip this place off?

26:26.552 --> 26:28.554
I think the fact that
you won't even consider it

26:28.620 --> 26:31.601
means you're either
lying to yourself, me, or both.

26:31.690 --> 26:35.137
Can we just, for a sec,
stop talking about what a mess my life is

26:35.227 --> 26:37.969
and get back to talking about how you do not
need to be here any more?

26:42.634 --> 26:44.079
I don't know if y'all remember me.

26:44.269 --> 26:46.044
The maid, not the housekeeper.

26:46.572 --> 26:47.778
I'm supposed to check on the koi.

26:48.040 --> 26:49.815
Afraid they're gonna have to tough it out.

26:49.942 --> 26:52.821
If Mr Monroe gets convicted,
the government gets to come in

26:52.911 --> 26:54.322
and sell this place off
and everything in it, right?

26:54.413 --> 26:55.448
You call him "mister"?

26:55.547 --> 26:57.151
So, how y'all bosses gonna feel

26:57.249 --> 26:58.922
if they miss out on 100,000 bucks

26:58.984 --> 27:00.657
'cause you wouldn't let me check the pH?

27:00.752 --> 27:01.753
Hold up.

27:02.321 --> 27:04.892
That bunch of goldfish is worth $100,000?

27:10.629 --> 27:11.767
Do what you got to do.

27:12.231 --> 27:14.142
We'll be along in a sec.

27:14.233 --> 27:16.474
There are only three places in Harlan
she's been known to stay.

27:16.568 --> 27:18.070
Audrey's, her mama's, and her sister's,

27:18.470 --> 27:19.471
and she ain't worked at Audrey's

27:19.571 --> 27:20.811
since Ava went away, so what's that mean?

27:21.240 --> 27:22.275
Her mama or her sister's.

27:22.341 --> 27:24.150
That's the reason why
I got you on the payroll.

27:24.243 --> 27:25.313
You know who she's working for?

27:25.410 --> 27:27.981
I have a pretty good idea,
but I need it confirmed,

27:28.080 --> 27:30.993
which means I need for you to take her alive.

27:31.083 --> 27:33.825
And I need nobody to know she's been took.

27:33.919 --> 27:35.262
Carl, I mean it... Alive!

27:36.088 --> 27:40.002
Dewey Crowe, your timing has never been
impeccable, and today is no exception.

27:40.092 --> 27:41.969
- I need a word, Boyd.
- Well, it's gonna have to wait.

27:42.027 --> 27:43.267
I'm awful busy at the moment.

27:43.328 --> 27:45.308
No, it can't wait. You ripped me off!

27:45.364 --> 27:46.434
I did what, now?

27:46.498 --> 27:49.502
There's a restaurant in Corbin
with full licences listed

27:49.601 --> 27:51.274
for half what I paid for Audrey's.

27:51.336 --> 27:54.340
Now, I can see how this peeling kerb
they got might hold the price down...

27:54.439 --> 27:56.680
Does this restaurant
have blowjobs on the menu?

27:57.376 --> 27:58.514
Apples and oranges, son.

27:58.610 --> 28:00.556
You said
I'd be making money hand over glove.

28:00.646 --> 28:03.024
Well, building a business takes time!

28:03.115 --> 28:05.527
The business you sold me
was supposed to already be built!

28:05.817 --> 28:08.661
Now, I want $100,000,
and I'm not leaving here without it.

28:09.188 --> 28:10.292
How about just $50,000?

28:10.889 --> 28:12.197
We can call it a loan.

28:13.192 --> 28:16.503
Well' I'll give you
a cut of the take from Audrey's.

28:17.462 --> 28:19.533
I got nowhere else to turn!

28:20.566 --> 28:23.410
You want to tell me what's really going on?

28:25.237 --> 28:26.648
My cousin's here from Florida.

28:26.705 --> 28:27.706
Well, that's a good thing.

28:27.806 --> 28:29.410
Family can be
the perfect salve in difficult times.

28:29.508 --> 28:32.978
You don't understand.
Cousin Darryl is difficult times.

28:33.679 --> 28:35.317
He wants Audrey's, Boyd.

28:36.048 --> 28:38.494
- I need him gone.
- Well, then, tell him to go!

28:38.550 --> 28:40.393
No, you don't know Darryl.

28:40.485 --> 28:42.226
No, but I know you.

28:42.754 --> 28:44.825
Now, Dewey Crowe,
you stand before me today

28:44.890 --> 28:47.166
a newly minted small businessman

28:47.226 --> 28:49.103
on his way to being bona tide.

28:49.328 --> 28:52.070
After everything you've been through,
lam proud of you, son.

28:52.497 --> 28:54.773
The only thing I know
about your Cousin Darryl

28:54.866 --> 28:57.176
is he doesn't know who he's related to.

28:58.370 --> 29:00.907
Now, sometimes, being a man means

29:01.006 --> 29:03.008
you got to know when to put your foot down.

29:03.275 --> 29:05.881
Well, put your foot down, Dewey Crowe!

29:27.899 --> 29:31.039
Well, on second thought, I can see how
someone would pay $100,000 for those.

29:32.070 --> 29:35.882
So, you want me to go back to Mr Monroe
and tell him that the safe was empty?

29:35.941 --> 29:37.614
- That's right.
- Why?

29:37.709 --> 29:39.450
'Cause we're telling you to.

29:39.544 --> 29:40.648
I don't understand.

29:40.746 --> 29:42.123
You don't need to understand.

29:42.214 --> 29:43.215
Don't need to do it, either.

29:43.282 --> 29:45.228
Now, Gloria, that's where you're wrong.

29:45.284 --> 29:46.456
You do need to do it.

29:46.551 --> 29:48.326
Otherwise, you're going to jail.

29:52.157 --> 29:53.761
Mrs Paxton called.

29:53.825 --> 29:56.738
She says she believes
Crowder's been driving by her house.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.638
Guess she should have ID'd him
when she had the chance.

29:58.897 --> 30:00.604
I have a hard time with her accent,

30:00.666 --> 30:03.442
but it sounded to me
like she wanted you, personal.

30:04.636 --> 30:05.808
Shit.

30:33.632 --> 30:35.111
You're so worried about your safety,

30:35.200 --> 30:37.612
you should probably
lock the front door before you shower.

30:37.669 --> 30:38.807
She's safe enough.

30:39.271 --> 30:41.615
You wanted a look. Keep on looking!

30:44.943 --> 30:46.650
Yes! Look at me.

30:47.279 --> 30:50.123
The other night on the road,
you shouldn't have done what you did to me.

30:50.515 --> 30:52.791
Don't do anything crazy, now, Boyd.

30:52.951 --> 30:56.364
If you kill a sheriff,
they're liable to hunt you down like a dog.

30:56.455 --> 30:58.025
Well, I'm hoping
I don't have to kill you, Mooney.

30:58.123 --> 30:59.625
I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

31:00.792 --> 31:02.066
Now, the money I offered Paxton,

31:02.160 --> 31:04.162
how about that ends up
under your mattress?

31:04.229 --> 31:06.038
Yeah. In exchange for what?

31:06.131 --> 31:08.236
Telling him you did as he asked,

31:08.333 --> 31:10.643
- put a bullet in the back of my head.
- Yeah.

31:14.806 --> 31:15.910
Better just kill him.

31:16.475 --> 31:17.715
You don't have to do that.

31:17.809 --> 31:18.913
I'll do anything you want.

31:19.010 --> 31:20.353
You can't trust his kind.

31:20.645 --> 31:22.886
He's only loyal as long as you have the gun.

31:22.981 --> 31:26.326
He's loyal as long as he knows
he's playing for the winning team.

31:26.818 --> 31:28.525
So, how about it, Mooney?

31:28.587 --> 31:31.830
Boyd Crowder or Lee Paxton?

31:32.357 --> 31:35.497
Now, who you figure's gonna
be the last man standing?

31:37.195 --> 31:38.902
Of course I'm sure.

31:38.997 --> 31:40.670
No, it was empty!

31:40.899 --> 31:43.846
Look, baby, I'm sorry, but your gold is gone.

31:44.503 --> 31:46.176
Well, all right.

31:47.205 --> 31:49.446
All right, I'll see you later. Be safe.

31:52.577 --> 31:54.022
What did he say?

31:54.079 --> 31:56.616
He said he's going to go kill Duffy.

31:58.617 --> 32:00.062
Givens is here.

32:00.218 --> 32:01.390
You're kidding.

32:01.686 --> 32:02.790
You want me to let him in?

32:02.888 --> 32:06.597
No, I want you to get back behind the wheel
and see if we can outrun him.

32:07.592 --> 32:09.970
Yes. Let him in.

32:18.403 --> 32:19.882
I'm looking to have a private word.

32:19.938 --> 32:22.782
I hope you understand if that doesn't
strike me as the fondest notion,

32:22.874 --> 32:24.717
given our recent history, Marshal.

32:24.776 --> 32:27.450
I hoped you were the kind of man
that chooses not to live in the past.

32:27.546 --> 32:28.581
Well, normally, lam.

32:28.647 --> 32:31.719
It's just that, you know,
try to kill me once, shame on you...

32:31.783 --> 32:33.763
Wynn, If I tried to kill you, you'd be dead.

32:33.819 --> 32:35.730
Besides, I'm here to protect you.

32:37.389 --> 32:40.632
Well, that's a refreshing change of pace.

32:41.560 --> 32:42.766
Mikey, give us a sec.

32:45.163 --> 32:47.234
Am I allowed
to ask who you're protecting me from?

32:47.499 --> 32:48.637
Charles Monroe.

32:48.733 --> 32:50.235
Don't believe I know that name.

32:50.302 --> 32:51.303
I'm betting you do,

32:51.403 --> 32:54.316
seeing as he washed
close to $3 million for you last couple years.

32:54.906 --> 32:57.147
Isn't there an "allegedly"
that goes along with that?

32:57.242 --> 32:58.778
At the moment,

32:58.844 --> 33:00.983
the only connection
between you and Monroe that interests me

33:01.079 --> 33:03.787
is the one that's
got him looking to put a bullet in your head.

33:03.849 --> 33:05.328
And which one is that?

33:05.417 --> 33:08.193
You installed a hidden safe in his office.

33:11.022 --> 33:12.501
Okay, let's say, for the sake of argument,

33:12.591 --> 33:16.835
that I do know a Mr Monroe
and that I did install a safe in his office.

33:16.928 --> 33:19.602
How does that lead to him wanting me dead?

33:19.664 --> 33:21.007
Come on, Wynn.

33:21.099 --> 33:23.978
Why would anyone want
to kill the guy that put in their security?

33:24.836 --> 33:25.940
Charlie got robbed?

33:26.171 --> 33:27.946
He believes he did.

33:28.440 --> 33:30.477
And Why?

33:30.542 --> 33:32.715
Well, I don't want to
bore you with the details.

33:32.811 --> 33:34.791
Basically, I led him to believe it.

33:34.846 --> 33:39.295
So, you're protecting me
from a situation you created?

33:39.351 --> 33:41.024
I can see how you'd see it that way,

33:41.119 --> 33:42.655
if you want to focus on the negative.

33:43.455 --> 33:46.061
Drop it! Get on the ground! Hands in the air!

33:46.391 --> 33:48.200
- You okay?
- Fine.

33:48.293 --> 33:50.500
He pulled and shot
before I cleared my holster.

33:50.562 --> 33:52.803
I had no choice. He drew down on me.

33:53.064 --> 33:54.134
Gun's legal.

33:54.232 --> 33:56.041
He's licensed to carry concealed.

33:56.635 --> 33:58.080
He ain't got license to shoot people.

33:59.004 --> 34:00.813
Guess I didn't think you had it in you.

34:01.306 --> 34:03.809
Mikey? Mikey's a stone killer.

34:05.043 --> 34:06.647
Why do you think I keep him around?

34:17.222 --> 34:20.431
You promised Mooney
the same money you promised me.

34:20.992 --> 34:22.562
That bother you?

34:22.661 --> 34:25.197
It would if I thought you intend to pay him.

34:26.331 --> 34:28.038
I just need a little time.

34:28.166 --> 34:30.373
How much time does it take
to kill an old man?

34:30.435 --> 34:32.779
You already did most of the job.

34:33.605 --> 34:35.676
That was an overreaction.

34:37.074 --> 34:39.954
You see, your husband
swore out a statement

34:41.612 --> 34:43.524
about what my Ava did,

34:44.683 --> 34:48.358
so if he dies, that statement still lives,

34:48.687 --> 34:52.429
so either I need to
make him change his testimony,

34:53.058 --> 34:55.038
or I need to make him out a liar.

34:56.428 --> 34:58.374
He is the pillar of the community...

34:58.430 --> 34:59.534
Or so he says.

35:00.131 --> 35:01.701
That's why I need a little time.

35:02.067 --> 35:04.047
He will need proof, you know.

35:04.202 --> 35:06.944
He won't take
the sheriff's word that you're dead.

35:07.038 --> 35:09.450
Well, I would say
that Mooney can bring him my head.

35:09.541 --> 35:12.579
But on most days, that's my best asset.

35:19.884 --> 35:21.727
- You have tattoos?
- A few.

35:22.454 --> 35:23.558
Show me.

35:58.089 --> 36:00.262
That was from a long time ago.

36:00.759 --> 36:04.138
On my street, growing up,
there were old men who killed Nazis

36:05.630 --> 36:07.667
and old men who were Nazis.

36:08.600 --> 36:09.772
Is it from prison?

36:10.435 --> 36:12.210
A place called Elkton.

36:14.706 --> 36:15.980
Same in Russian prison.

36:16.841 --> 36:19.048
Your tattoos tell your story.

36:23.148 --> 36:25.458
You have cold hands, Miss Mara.

36:26.685 --> 36:31.464
My mother used to say,
"Cold hands, strong body."

36:32.290 --> 36:35.203
And I'm not quite sure I see the connection.

36:35.960 --> 36:38.304
She meant that
when you live in a place that is so cold

36:38.363 --> 36:40.809
your body can't heat all of itself,

36:41.633 --> 36:45.080
so it learns
that there are parts you must keep warm...

36:45.737 --> 36:47.978
And parts that can do without.

36:50.008 --> 36:52.045
Would you give up your arm?

36:52.977 --> 36:55.014
Well, no disrespect to your mama,

36:56.047 --> 36:58.653
- but a one-armed criminal...
- She was a survivor.

37:00.385 --> 37:03.093
I think you know something
about this, as well.

37:19.104 --> 37:20.378
What about your hand?

37:32.050 --> 37:34.257
We'll put this tattoo on a dead man's hand.

37:41.860 --> 37:44.864
You have a dead man
lying around somewhere, Miss Mara?

37:47.031 --> 37:48.374
Of course.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.543
My husband owns a funeral home.

37:57.642 --> 37:59.212
What about you?

38:00.278 --> 38:02.053
What about me what?

38:03.248 --> 38:05.250
Can you find a dead man?

38:06.618 --> 38:08.723
Can you find more than one?

38:13.958 --> 38:16.768
So, you finally have the place to yourself?

38:16.828 --> 38:19.274
No more threat, no more need for backup.

38:19.964 --> 38:21.272
What will happen to the gold?

38:21.900 --> 38:24.107
Sit in a warehouse
till Monroe gets convicted.

38:24.169 --> 38:25.273
Then we'll auction it.

38:26.004 --> 38:27.813
I thought you said it was likely
he wouldn't get convicted.

38:27.906 --> 38:31.149
That was before.
Charges we got on him now...

38:31.810 --> 38:34.484
Kidnapping, attempted murder, so forth.

38:34.579 --> 38:36.490
He's got a lot of barbed wire in his future.

38:37.182 --> 38:39.753
All 'cause he didn't believe
his girlfriend was telling the truth.

38:40.251 --> 38:41.821
She's his maid.

38:42.420 --> 38:44.593
Gets me thinking how you see me.

38:44.656 --> 38:47.102
Worried I'll see you
as my maid or as my girlfriend?

38:47.158 --> 38:49.638
This whole time,
you never once wondered if I was part of it?

38:51.095 --> 38:52.267
Were you?

38:52.597 --> 38:53.769
Part of you wish I'd been?

38:55.366 --> 38:58.313
You tend to get involved with
women who run afoul of the law?

38:58.703 --> 38:59.943
It's happened once or twice.

39:00.004 --> 39:01.642
I wouldn't call it a tendency.

39:01.940 --> 39:03.146
What would you call it?

39:03.208 --> 39:05.017
Tell you the truth, left to my own devices,

39:05.109 --> 39:06.884
I'd probably never think about it.

39:07.712 --> 39:09.191
Never can be sure.

39:09.547 --> 39:10.855
Of what?

39:11.382 --> 39:13.453
That I wasn't in on it.

39:14.118 --> 39:15.688
I guess that's right.

39:15.787 --> 39:19.291
Kind of like how now you know
there's one hidden treasure in this place...

39:20.692 --> 39:22.638
You'll never be certain there aren't others.

39:22.994 --> 39:24.632
Stands to reason.

39:25.496 --> 39:27.635
Anyway, can't hurt to look.

39:28.733 --> 39:30.508
Any suggestions where I might start?

39:34.739 --> 39:36.150
One or two.

39:38.309 --> 39:39.515
Messer!

39:41.179 --> 39:42.487
What the hell's going on?

39:42.547 --> 39:43.753
Messer!

39:43.848 --> 39:45.521
Hey, Dewey.

39:45.583 --> 39:46.994
Where is everybody?

39:47.051 --> 39:49.657
Man, I sent everyone home, man. Closed up.

39:49.721 --> 39:51.029
What did you do that for?

39:51.522 --> 39:52.762
You get the money from Boyd?

39:52.857 --> 39:55.736
Well, if I did, you still ain't getting a cent.

39:56.494 --> 39:58.701
Yeah, that's what I came to tell you.

39:58.763 --> 40:00.401
You're hitting the road, cousin.

40:00.832 --> 40:02.937
This here's my whorehouse.

40:03.735 --> 40:05.009
My dream.

40:05.570 --> 40:07.709
And you ain't any pan of it.

40:08.773 --> 40:10.275
Shit, Dewey.

40:10.675 --> 40:13.588
Okay. All right, Dewey.

40:13.945 --> 40:16.858
Don't take no shit from nobody. I like that.

40:17.849 --> 40:19.260
Before I go, you want me to tell you

40:19.350 --> 40:23.355
why what should be a gold mine
is bringing back such itty-bitty returns?

40:23.721 --> 40:25.530
I got a leaky water pipe or something?

40:26.591 --> 40:28.070
Or something.

40:29.193 --> 40:30.467
Well, come look for yourself.

40:39.304 --> 40:40.442
There he is.

40:41.406 --> 40:42.407
Yeah.

40:42.774 --> 40:44.981
- What the hell?
- Yeah, take him out.

40:47.979 --> 40:49.049
Yeah.

40:50.782 --> 40:52.989
There it is. See that?

40:53.418 --> 40:56.456
See your Cousin Danny,
this herds Jean Baptiste...

40:56.554 --> 40:57.658
He's Haitian.

40:57.755 --> 41:00.599
And Cousin Kendal's
racked up in one of them trailers.

41:00.658 --> 41:03.571
- You know how teenagers be.
- Why did you do that to Messer?

41:04.562 --> 41:06.269
Well, let him tell you himself.

41:06.331 --> 41:07.639
Hey' man.

41:07.899 --> 41:09.310
You got something to say to my cousin?

41:12.003 --> 41:13.243
Speak up.

41:13.938 --> 41:16.782
I've been skimming, Dewey.

41:17.442 --> 41:18.944
I'm awful sorry.

41:19.010 --> 41:20.921
Now tell him how much.

41:21.245 --> 41:25.455
Well, you should be making
almost three grand a week

41:26.084 --> 41:27.427
after expenses.

41:27.785 --> 41:28.855
You son of a bitch!

41:28.953 --> 41:30.432
Dewey!

41:31.189 --> 41:32.327
You piece of shit!

41:32.423 --> 41:33.834
- Now tell him why.
- Boyd...

41:33.925 --> 41:36.963
Boyd put me up to it! He gave me no choice.

41:37.028 --> 41:38.666
- Hold on!
- I wanted like hell to tell you.

41:38.763 --> 41:40.208
I felt awful bad about it.

41:40.765 --> 41:41.835
I'm sorry.

41:42.367 --> 41:45.644
It hurls. It hurts real good.

41:50.375 --> 41:52.787
I know that pain. I know it hurts.

41:53.478 --> 41:54.957
Just breathe.

41:55.446 --> 41:59.485
You see, all the answers to your questions,
right from the piggy's mouth, right?

42:00.518 --> 42:03.192
Only question now is how do you
get rid of bodies around here?

42:03.955 --> 42:05.957
Back home, we just feed 'em to the gators.

42:08.626 --> 42:10.128
Hold on. What?

42:11.562 --> 42:13.473
You're gonna kill him?

42:13.831 --> 42:16.812
No, Dewey. He didn't steal from me.

42:19.971 --> 42:21.177
You are.

42:51.436 --> 42:52.574
Anybody see you?

42:52.670 --> 42:54.274
Didn't go in till her mama left for the bingo.

42:54.939 --> 42:55.940
Open it.

43:09.754 --> 43:11.233
Take it off.

43:14.459 --> 43:15.597
Where is he?

43:16.627 --> 43:18.072
I don't know.

43:22.266 --> 43:24.473
I swear to God. I swear.

43:28.873 --> 43:30.216
He called...

43:30.708 --> 43:32.779
And he said he would pay me

43:32.877 --> 43:36.757
if I found out when the drugs
were coming in, so I found out.

43:37.582 --> 43:39.391
And you called him back.

43:42.086 --> 43:43.497
She got a cell phone on her?

43:50.761 --> 43:53.332
He filed under his first or last name?

43:55.633 --> 43:56.737
First.

44:04.242 --> 44:05.687
<i>Hey, darling.</i>

44:06.511 --> 44:08.620
Hello, Cousin Johnny.
