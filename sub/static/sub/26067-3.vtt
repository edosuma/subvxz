Previously on <i>The Truth About</i>
<i>the Harry Quebert Affair...</i>

00:07.368 --> 00:09.190
Well, this is me.

00:09.290 --> 00:10.471
I work here on Saturdays.

00:10.571 --> 00:11.992
You should, uh, come by.

00:12.092 --> 00:13.434
<i>[Mrs. Quinn]:</i>
<i>For the past week,</i>

00:13.534 --> 00:15.155
<i>the famous New York writer</i>
<i>Mr. Harry Quebert</i>

00:15.255 --> 00:17.437
<i>has been coming here every day.</i>

00:17.537 --> 00:19.519
Is this one of the best
restaurants?

00:19.619 --> 00:20.300
[together]:
Yes, Mrs. Quinn.

00:20.380 --> 00:21.201
Yes, Mom.

00:21.301 --> 00:23.363
And don't call me Mom, okay?

00:23.463 --> 00:25.124
It's not a country inn.

00:25.224 --> 00:26.085
[Marcus]:
Whatever happened

00:26.185 --> 00:27.126
to innocent until
proven guilty?

00:27.226 --> 00:29.528
I can't just
leave it there.

00:29.628 --> 00:32.291
The whole thing
makes me wanna puke.

00:32.391 --> 00:34.052
Oh, shit...

00:34.152 --> 00:36.254
Go back
to New York, Marcus.

00:36.354 --> 00:38.456
Stay far away
from all this.

00:38.556 --> 00:40.899
[Marcus]: How come I never
heard of Nola Kellergan before,

00:40.999 --> 00:42.540
all the time
I've been coming here?

00:42.640 --> 00:43.741
[Travis]:
Till we found her corpse,

00:43.841 --> 00:45.223
it was all ancient history.

00:45.323 --> 00:48.906
I want you to tell me
about Nola, who she was.

00:49.006 --> 00:50.387
I need to know
everything, Harry,

00:50.487 --> 00:52.349
if we're gonna
get you out of here.

00:52.449 --> 00:54.391
[Marcus]: Harry didn't kill
that girl, Travis, I know it.

00:54.491 --> 00:56.233
[Travis]:
Because he's your friend?

00:56.333 --> 00:57.794
[Marcus]: Because there's
someone out there

00:57.894 --> 00:59.896
who doesn't want me
to figure out who did.

01:00.897 --> 01:02.398
This is serious, Marcus.

01:02.498 --> 01:03.720
You should have
handed this over

01:03.820 --> 01:04.961
to Gahalowood.

01:05.061 --> 01:06.762
I've seen a lot of crazy shit
as a cop.

01:06.862 --> 01:09.125
People up in this
corner of the country

01:09.225 --> 01:13.208
do a lot of disgusting stuff
with woodchippers and axes...

01:13.308 --> 01:14.770
But I have
two daughters,

01:14.870 --> 01:15.931
and I can't imagine
going through

01:16.031 --> 01:17.652
what Mr. Kellergan
as gone through.

01:17.752 --> 01:18.733
[sobbing] Get out...

01:18.833 --> 01:20.835
Please just go now.

01:22.196 --> 01:23.898
Hey...

01:23.998 --> 01:26.000
Hey!

01:37.250 --> 01:40.093
[âªâªâªâªâª]

02:38.306 --> 02:40.308
[door unlocks]

02:47.074 --> 02:49.136
Thanks for coming.

02:49.236 --> 02:50.738
Did you hear about the car?

02:50.838 --> 02:51.478
No, I haven't heard
about anything.

02:51.558 --> 02:52.379
What happened?

02:52.479 --> 02:54.661
Tell me what
happened.

02:54.761 --> 02:56.763
Your Corvette
got torched last night.

02:57.644 --> 02:59.646
Whoa!

03:04.290 --> 03:07.373
[firefighters shout,
hoses spraying]

03:09.535 --> 03:10.436
Marcus?

03:10.536 --> 03:11.397
Hi, Travis.

03:11.497 --> 03:12.398
You okay?

03:12.498 --> 03:14.159
Yeah, uh, yeah,
I was coming back,

03:14.259 --> 03:16.641
and then as I turned
in the driveway, I, um...

03:16.741 --> 03:19.484
I saw somebody
running into the woods,

03:19.584 --> 03:21.566
and then I saw the flames.

03:21.666 --> 03:23.207
Would you be able to identify
the person you saw?

03:23.307 --> 03:24.489
No, no,
it was too dark.

03:24.589 --> 03:26.851
Chief Travis!

03:26.951 --> 03:29.613
I found this near the car.

03:29.713 --> 03:31.715
"Strike three"?

03:34.398 --> 03:36.059
Yeah, I, uh...

03:36.159 --> 03:40.183
I got the second one
yesterday.

03:40.283 --> 03:41.504
I told you, Marcus,
this isn't a joke.

03:41.604 --> 03:42.665
I know, I know.

03:42.765 --> 03:44.507
I'm gonna leave a patrol car
here for the night

03:44.607 --> 03:45.468
just in case.

03:45.568 --> 03:46.949
Okay.

03:47.049 --> 03:48.130
Travis Dawn is having
the note analyzed,

03:48.210 --> 03:49.431
but it really looks like

03:49.531 --> 03:51.794
someone doesn't want me
digging into this thing.

03:51.894 --> 03:52.795
[sighs]

03:52.895 --> 03:53.635
You know
I'm supposed to go

03:53.735 --> 03:54.876
in front of the grand jury

03:54.976 --> 03:55.837
next Tuesday.

03:55.937 --> 03:57.038
Mm-hm.

03:57.138 --> 03:58.640
Roth says

03:58.740 --> 04:02.123
they almost always side
with the prosecution.

04:02.223 --> 04:04.225
[sighs] Yeah.

04:06.627 --> 04:10.210
It's like a nightmare.

04:10.310 --> 04:12.593
That I can't wake up from.

04:13.674 --> 04:14.775
You know, they arrest me,

04:14.875 --> 04:19.139
and I think I'm gonna be out
in a few hours...

04:19.239 --> 04:20.620
Now I could just...

04:20.720 --> 04:22.422
rot here for the rest
of my life.

04:22.522 --> 04:24.063
Hey, you're not gonna go
to prison, okay?

04:24.163 --> 04:26.145
Me and Roth,

04:26.245 --> 04:28.247
we're here to make sure
that doesn't happen.

04:32.651 --> 04:33.712
[clicks button]

04:33.812 --> 04:34.913
Tell me more

04:35.013 --> 04:36.274
about you and Nola,

04:36.374 --> 04:38.877
your time together
outside of Clark's.

04:38.977 --> 04:41.439
Okay.

04:41.539 --> 04:43.541
Um...

04:43.981 --> 04:46.244
Things happened without
my meaning them to.

04:46.344 --> 04:47.365
I felt safe at Clark's.

04:47.465 --> 04:49.887
<i>Professional.</i>

04:49.987 --> 04:51.108
<i>But the day she invited me</i>
<i>to her concert,</i>

04:51.188 --> 04:52.649
<i>the day I met her father,</i>

04:52.749 --> 04:55.632
<i>[sighing] that's when I knew</i>
<i>I was in trouble.</i>

04:58.675 --> 04:59.656
...thank you very much

04:59.756 --> 05:01.538
for that generous,
generous donation--

05:01.638 --> 05:02.498
Sorry.

05:02.598 --> 05:03.499
I just wanted to
introduce you

05:03.599 --> 05:04.340
to someone.

05:04.440 --> 05:06.302
Sure.

05:06.402 --> 05:07.623
Mr. Quebert?

05:07.723 --> 05:08.544
Yes?

05:08.644 --> 05:09.465
Sorry to interrupt.

05:09.565 --> 05:10.386
I'm-- I'm done
for the day.

05:10.486 --> 05:11.206
I just wanted
to introduce you

05:11.286 --> 05:12.147
to my father.

05:12.247 --> 05:13.108
Oh!

05:13.208 --> 05:13.969
Reverend
David Kellergan,

05:14.049 --> 05:14.670
this is Mr. Quebert.

05:14.770 --> 05:15.670
Ah...

05:15.770 --> 05:16.651
A pleasure.
Very nice to meet you

05:16.731 --> 05:18.153
So you're
the famous writer

05:18.253 --> 05:19.474
come to grace
our little town.

05:19.574 --> 05:20.455
Well, I think
it's your little town

05:20.535 --> 05:22.437
that has graced me.

05:22.537 --> 05:23.578
[chuckles] Well, you should
stop by our church

05:23.658 --> 05:24.959
some Sunday.

05:25.059 --> 05:27.561
It's a small congregation,
but filled with good people.

05:27.661 --> 05:28.762
I'm sure you'd fit right in.

05:28.862 --> 05:31.445
Well, thank you very much
for the invitation,

05:31.545 --> 05:35.288
but I think I'm more of
a Thoreau kind of guy.

05:35.388 --> 05:38.371
I find my soul comes alive
when I'm alone in nature.

05:38.471 --> 05:39.733
Ah.

05:39.833 --> 05:41.694
Well, uh, perhaps one day

05:41.794 --> 05:43.256
you'll allow me
to introduce you

05:43.356 --> 05:44.537
to the true joy
of Christian fellowship--

05:44.637 --> 05:45.978
Okay... [laughs]

05:46.078 --> 05:47.059
All right, Daddy.

05:47.159 --> 05:48.901
Uh, we're gonna go.

05:49.001 --> 05:50.062
Um...

05:50.162 --> 05:52.504
there's a high school
show today at 5:30.

05:52.604 --> 05:54.466
Oh, my daughter here
has the voice of an angel.

05:54.566 --> 05:55.267
Oh, really?

05:55.367 --> 05:56.548
Stop...

05:56.648 --> 05:57.949
Wow.

05:58.049 --> 05:59.671
Now, Nola, leave Mr.
Quebert here in peace.

05:59.771 --> 06:01.312
Why would he want to come
to a high school show?

06:01.412 --> 06:02.593
He might
want a break...

06:02.693 --> 06:04.155
from writing.

06:04.255 --> 06:05.436
Yeah, I'm...
Well, to be honest,

06:05.536 --> 06:07.158
I have a lot of work
I need to get done.

06:07.258 --> 06:08.439
There you go.
You see?

06:08.539 --> 06:10.200
You have a good evening
now, Mr. Quebert.

06:10.300 --> 06:12.082
It was a real pleasure
meeting you, Reverend.

06:12.182 --> 06:13.283
Same here.

06:13.383 --> 06:14.284
Break a leg.

06:14.384 --> 06:16.386
Thank you.

06:18.468 --> 06:19.649
He seems very nice.

06:19.749 --> 06:21.951
Mm-hm, yeah, he is.

06:28.077 --> 06:30.079
[âªâªâªâªâª]

07:04.750 --> 07:06.212

07:06.312 --> 07:07.133
Yes.

07:07.233 --> 07:07.973
I'm Maggie Pratt.

07:08.073 --> 07:08.854
Hi, Maggie.

07:08.954 --> 07:09.815
This is Chief Pratt.

07:09.915 --> 07:10.816
Hi, Chief.

07:10.916 --> 07:11.697
I'm the Chief's wife.

07:11.797 --> 07:12.978
It's an honor

10:01.352 --> 10:02.653
You should go home.

10:02.753 --> 10:04.755
Why'd you run off?

10:06.036 --> 10:08.379
You should go home.

10:08.479 --> 10:11.822
I'm a little...
I've been drinking.

10:11.922 --> 10:13.744
I'm a--
I'm a little drunk.

10:13.844 --> 10:16.886
Why were you drinking, Harry?

10:26.175 --> 10:29.178
I'm just tired of the solitude.

10:34.102 --> 10:36.224
I'm here to keep you company.

10:43.471 --> 10:45.773
I finished
your book, Harry,

10:45.873 --> 10:47.294
"The Mirror of Life"?

10:47.394 --> 10:48.576
Mm-hm?

10:48.676 --> 10:50.677
It broke my heart.

10:51.358 --> 10:53.540
It was so open,
and beautiful,

10:53.640 --> 10:55.642
and...

10:58.565 --> 11:00.566
brave.

11:01.808 --> 11:03.549
Thank you.

11:03.649 --> 11:06.632
Maybe it's just...

11:06.732 --> 11:09.194
it's just easier to...
hmm...

11:09.294 --> 11:10.756
to write about the world

11:10.856 --> 11:13.258
than... live in it.

11:16.101 --> 11:18.203
It's not easier,

11:18.303 --> 11:20.725
it's safer.

11:20.825 --> 11:23.748
Like riding a bike
with the brakes on.

11:25.349 --> 11:26.771
But who wants to
ride a bike with the--

11:26.871 --> 11:27.731
with the brakes on?

Yes.

Did you hear it
all the way through?

Yes.

Your dad was right.

About what?

You have a voice of an angel.

<i>[Harry]: Well, I had</i>
<i>to get her out of my head.</i>

12:25.764 --> 12:26.866
So the following week,

12:26.966 --> 12:29.548
I tried to get
closer to Jenny...

12:29.648 --> 12:32.611
Jenny who works in the diner.

<i>She was sweet.</i>

<i>I liked her.</i>

12:39.737 --> 12:41.879
<i>She was flirting with me,</i>

12:41.979 --> 12:44.041
<i>and at 26,</i>
<i>she was starting to worry</i>

12:44.141 --> 12:46.163
<i>about living at home</i>
<i>with her parents.</i>

12:46.263 --> 12:47.685
You gotta eat something, Harry.

12:47.785 --> 12:49.206
You're gonna get heartburn

12:49.306 --> 12:50.527
if you're tryin' to get by
on an empty stomach

12:50.627 --> 12:52.729
and half a gallon of coffee.

12:52.829 --> 12:54.491
Okay, I'm gonna have
two eggs over easy,

12:54.591 --> 12:55.492
bacon...

12:55.592 --> 12:56.413
Do you have English muffins?

12:56.513 --> 12:57.974
Yeah, we do.

12:58.074 --> 12:59.536
Would you do, um,
a grilled English muffin

12:59.636 --> 13:00.857
with a little bit of butter?

13:00.957 --> 13:02.178
Whoa, this is
a big order--

13:02.278 --> 13:03.379
[laughing] I know,

13:03.479 --> 13:05.421
and I'll have a quart
of coffee would be fine.

13:05.521 --> 13:06.982
Okay, great.

13:07.082 --> 13:08.904
[chuckling] Oh, gosh...

13:09.004 --> 13:10.506
How's it going?
[pouring coffee]

13:10.606 --> 13:12.908
You know, you know...

13:13.008 --> 13:14.189
I'm filling up pages.

13:14.289 --> 13:16.431
Yeah? This, uh,

13:16.531 --> 13:18.653
this might be forward of me,
but what's it about?

13:19.734 --> 13:22.316
I'll let you know
when I... I find out.

13:22.416 --> 13:23.477
But I do know

13:23.577 --> 13:24.839
that I'm gonna set it
in a small town

13:24.939 --> 13:27.121
by the ocean.

13:27.221 --> 13:29.923
I hope that being here
has given you some inspiration.

13:30.023 --> 13:31.845
It has,
and I promise

13:31.945 --> 13:34.648
I'll change all the names
to protect the innocent.

13:34.748 --> 13:36.409
[laughs]

13:36.509 --> 13:38.451
Okay, well, I'll, uh...

13:38.551 --> 13:41.494
I'll go get your, um,
fancy English muffin.

13:41.594 --> 13:42.695
Great.

13:42.795 --> 13:43.696
Do you have blueberry?

13:43.796 --> 13:45.798
Crispy bacon,
I've got it all.

13:54.326 --> 13:56.908
A grilled English muffin,
bacon and eggs

13:57.008 --> 14:00.151
for the extraordinary
Monsieur Quebert.

14:00.251 --> 14:01.873
He likes you.

14:01.973 --> 14:03.794
Oh, my gosh, stop being
a peeping tom, Mother.

14:03.894 --> 14:05.276
He's just being nice.

14:05.376 --> 14:07.678
I think he's basing
a character on you.

14:07.778 --> 14:09.880
I wouldn't be surprised
if it was the main one.

14:09.980 --> 14:12.362
Don't be ridiculous.

14:12.462 --> 14:14.805
I've seen him.

14:14.905 --> 14:16.366
He's always
staring at you,

14:16.466 --> 14:18.047
and then quickly
writing something down,

14:18.147 --> 14:19.649
you know, like
your mannerisms?

14:19.749 --> 14:21.411
Or, like...
something you said.

14:21.511 --> 14:22.732
You're imagining things, Mama.

14:22.832 --> 14:24.093
A man like Harry Quebert

14:24.193 --> 14:26.896
isn't gonna be interested
in some small-town waitress.

14:26.996 --> 14:27.977
And why not?

14:28.077 --> 14:30.078
You're beautiful,
you're smart.

14:31.119 --> 14:32.861
You're exactly
the kind of woman

14:32.961 --> 14:35.303
that men
write books about.

14:35.403 --> 14:37.145
Trust me.

14:37.245 --> 14:38.786
I didn't raise
a prom queen

14:38.886 --> 14:41.689
so she could spend her life
slinging burgers and fries.

14:49.376 --> 14:51.198
Hey, Jenny.

14:51.298 --> 14:52.239
Jen...

14:52.339 --> 14:53.440
[sighs nervously]

14:53.540 --> 14:55.542
Hiya, Jenny.

14:56.022 --> 14:57.283
Hiya, Jenny.

14:57.383 --> 14:58.544
<i>Thunderbolt and Lightfoot</i>
is at the Montburry

14:58.625 --> 14:59.886
on Saturday.

14:59.986 --> 15:01.287
It's about bank robbers
and car chases,

15:01.387 --> 15:02.448
so it's racy.

15:02.548 --> 15:03.449
Ha ha.

15:03.549 --> 15:04.650
Wanna go?

15:04.750 --> 15:06.132
Maybe grab some dinner

15:06.232 --> 15:09.995
at the restaurant
next to the post office?

15:10.916 --> 15:12.918
Yup. Okay.

15:14.359 --> 15:15.100
Hi, Jenny.

15:15.200 --> 15:17.062
Oh, hey, Travis.

15:17.162 --> 15:18.062
Coffee?

15:18.162 --> 15:20.164
Sure.

15:25.729 --> 15:28.112
[stammers nervously]
So, uh, J-Jenny, um,

15:28.212 --> 15:30.214
I was just wondering...

15:31.375 --> 15:33.376
Yeah?

15:35.739 --> 15:38.801
The movie theater.

15:38.901 --> 15:41.204
What about
the movie theater?

15:41.304 --> 15:42.805
I, um...

15:42.905 --> 15:45.087
Um...

15:45.187 --> 15:46.569
There's been
a robbery

15:46.669 --> 15:47.810
at the movie theater
in Montburry.

15:47.910 --> 15:49.171
Oh, my god,
that's terrible.

15:49.271 --> 15:50.692
Actually, it was
at the post office.

15:50.792 --> 15:53.335
Wait, the post office

15:53.435 --> 15:54.856
or the movie theater?

15:54.956 --> 15:55.797
Um, well, actually,
what I'm trying--

15:55.877 --> 15:56.858
Jenny!

15:56.958 --> 15:58.299
Jenny!

15:58.399 --> 15:59.821
[sighs]
Excuse me, Travis.

15:59.921 --> 16:02.023
Mom's been in a really
foul mood lately.

16:02.123 --> 16:04.185
Enjoy the coffee.

16:04.285 --> 16:06.287
[chuckles awkwardly]

16:08.489 --> 16:10.490
Robbery...

16:11.011 --> 16:12.913
At the movie theater.

16:13.013 --> 16:14.995
<i>[Harry]: Jenny was, uh...</i>

16:15.095 --> 16:15.915
<i>She was a nice girl,</i>

16:16.015 --> 16:18.017
a really nice girl.

16:20.099 --> 16:23.222
But she wasn't Nola.

16:24.904 --> 16:28.767
<i>I'd never met anyone</i>
<i>so open and unaffected.</i>

16:28.867 --> 16:30.989
<i>I'd go to Clark's</i>
<i>every Saturday.</i>

16:32.110 --> 16:33.492
We'd have these
incredible conversations.

16:33.592 --> 16:35.213
Mm-hm.

16:35.313 --> 16:37.135
She had
such a curiosity

16:37.235 --> 16:38.216
about everything,

16:38.316 --> 16:39.417
music, books, art.

16:39.517 --> 16:41.339
<i>She awakened something in me,</i>

16:41.439 --> 16:45.122
<i>an aliveness</i>
<i>I hadn't felt in years.</i>

16:46.323 --> 16:48.385
The day would fly by,
and around...

16:48.485 --> 16:52.109
6:00 she'd be done.

16:52.209 --> 16:54.551
I'd always offer her
a ride home.

16:54.651 --> 16:56.393
I'd take her halfway home,

16:56.493 --> 16:58.034
and then she'd want
to walk with me

16:58.134 --> 17:00.276
at least
part of the way.

17:00.376 --> 17:02.318
I was...

17:02.418 --> 17:04.240
I said, "No.

17:04.340 --> 17:07.082
We can't walk."

17:07.182 --> 17:09.204
It was complicated.

17:09.304 --> 17:11.166
Well, walking
isn't a crime.

17:11.266 --> 17:13.288
No, but people will
start asking questions.

17:13.388 --> 17:14.970
[laughs] So?

17:15.070 --> 17:17.852
We'll tell them the truth.

17:17.952 --> 17:20.335
That we were discussing
Forster, and Dickens,

17:20.435 --> 17:21.776
and why Maria Callas'
"Tosca"

17:21.876 --> 17:22.937
is still
the greatest performance

17:23.037 --> 17:26.180
by an opera singer ever.

17:26.280 --> 17:30.344
I don't have anyone else
to talk to about these things.

17:30.444 --> 17:32.145
I just wish
we could be together

17:32.245 --> 17:35.208
without having to hide.

17:51.863 --> 17:53.865
[sighs]

17:55.146 --> 17:58.650
One day,
before I dropped her off,

17:58.750 --> 18:02.113
she asked if we could somehow
get away on a Saturday.

18:03.994 --> 18:06.016
She'd give Mrs. Quinn
some excuse,

18:06.116 --> 18:09.099
and that Jenny
would cover for her.

18:09.199 --> 18:12.622
I decided we could go up
to Rockland for the day.

18:12.722 --> 18:15.365
Harry, that...

18:18.047 --> 18:18.988
[sighs]

18:19.088 --> 18:22.371
I don't need your
judgments, Marcus.

18:25.534 --> 18:26.515
[sighs]

18:26.615 --> 18:27.556
If you don't think
I haven't spent

18:27.656 --> 18:28.917
the last 30 years
condemning myself,

18:29.017 --> 18:30.439
well, then...

18:30.539 --> 18:35.023
you don't really
know me at all.

18:52.359 --> 18:54.100
Oh, shit, shit...

18:54.200 --> 18:55.101
[clattering]

18:55.201 --> 18:56.743
Shit!

18:56.843 --> 18:58.424
All right,

18:58.524 --> 19:00.066
what's going on?

19:00.166 --> 19:01.828
And what are you doing
wearing that?

19:01.928 --> 19:03.389
Where's your uniform?

19:03.489 --> 19:04.950
He always comes
on Saturdays.

19:05.050 --> 19:06.111
Harry.

19:06.211 --> 19:08.153
That's-that's why I said
I'd cover for Nola.

19:08.253 --> 19:09.795
So where is he?

19:09.895 --> 19:11.036
Well, did he know you
were working today?

19:11.136 --> 19:11.957
No.

19:12.057 --> 19:13.438
Oh, for heaven sake's,

19:13.538 --> 19:15.080
the man's not
a mind reader.

19:15.180 --> 19:17.181
How would he know
you're here?

19:18.262 --> 19:19.844
Oh. I guess...

19:19.944 --> 19:21.405
Yeah? See?

19:21.505 --> 19:23.047
Yeah, you're right,
I guess he wouldn't.

19:23.147 --> 19:25.689
Oh, what a jerk,
look at me, I'm just...

19:25.789 --> 19:28.292
I was all dressed up
and nowhere to go.

19:28.392 --> 19:31.575
Not necessarily.

19:31.675 --> 19:33.657
Here's what
you're gonna do.

19:33.757 --> 19:35.659
You're gonna go
over to Goose Cove,

19:35.759 --> 19:37.901
and you're gonna
bring him a picnic lunch.

19:38.001 --> 19:39.222
I mean, the poor man's

19:39.322 --> 19:40.783
probably been working so hard

19:40.883 --> 19:42.905
he's forgotten to eat.

19:43.005 --> 19:45.908
There are two ways
to a man's heart,

19:46.008 --> 19:47.870
one through his stomach,

19:47.970 --> 19:50.392
and one through...

19:50.492 --> 19:51.593
a nice dress.

19:51.693 --> 19:52.474
[laughs]

19:52.574 --> 19:53.475
Oh, oh, easy.

19:53.575 --> 19:55.236
Okay, now, go home,
and, you know,

19:55.336 --> 19:56.478
get yourself
all dolled up.

19:56.578 --> 19:58.579
Okay.

20:00.261 --> 20:01.562
Okay.

20:01.662 --> 20:03.864
[seagulls calling]

20:05.346 --> 20:07.328
They're so beautiful,
aren't they?

20:07.428 --> 20:08.449
Mmm.

20:08.549 --> 20:11.291
So graceful and free.

20:11.391 --> 20:13.133
You know,
once they find their mate,

20:13.233 --> 20:14.534
they stay together
for life.

20:14.634 --> 20:16.636
Really?

20:17.477 --> 20:20.860
I think you should put
seagulls in your book.

20:20.960 --> 20:21.981
If you want,

20:22.081 --> 20:24.984
I'll put them
on every page.

20:25.084 --> 20:26.385
What's your new book about?

20:26.485 --> 20:27.706
Is it a love story?

20:27.806 --> 20:29.428
Kind of.

20:29.528 --> 20:31.510
With lots of
monogamous seagulls.

20:31.610 --> 20:33.612
[laughs]

20:42.900 --> 20:44.762
What'd you tell your parents?

20:44.862 --> 20:46.884
I told them
I was with my friend, Nancy.

20:46.984 --> 20:47.805
Mm-hm?

20:47.905 --> 20:49.887
And we left early
to spend the day

20:49.987 --> 20:52.569
on her boyfriend Teddy's
father's boat.

20:52.669 --> 20:53.570
And where's Nancy?

20:53.670 --> 20:55.372
On the boat with Teddy.

20:55.472 --> 20:56.813
Alone.

20:56.913 --> 20:58.374
She said that
I was with them,

20:58.474 --> 21:01.037
so Teddy's parents
let them take the boat out.

21:05.321 --> 21:07.322
What?

21:18.533 --> 21:20.535
[rings doorbell]

21:28.061 --> 21:30.904

Oh.

You know, Saturday's
not just the same

23:00.386 --> 23:02.248
without your
daughter, Reverend.

23:02.348 --> 23:03.449
Very nice of you

23:03.549 --> 23:05.010
to give her the day off,
Mrs. Quinn.

23:05.110 --> 23:06.011
She got up at dawn

23:06.111 --> 23:08.574
to go sailing
with friends, so...

23:08.674 --> 23:10.736
Such a sweet girl
you raised.

23:10.836 --> 23:11.857
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Quinn.

23:11.957 --> 23:13.958
I do appreciate hearing that,
thank you.

23:14.559 --> 23:15.580
Hmm.

23:15.680 --> 23:18.663
No sign of the famous
writer today, huh?

23:18.763 --> 23:19.704
I think he's at home.

23:19.804 --> 23:22.026
You know, busy, busy.

23:22.126 --> 23:23.547
Charming man.

23:23.647 --> 23:25.649
Have you met him?

23:26.410 --> 23:27.751
I'm hoping to convince him

23:27.851 --> 23:28.952
to become a member

23:29.052 --> 23:30.233
of the congregation.

23:30.333 --> 23:31.595
We need people like him

23:31.695 --> 23:34.057
to move this town forward.

23:35.778 --> 23:37.520
Well,
I think he's gonna be around

23:37.620 --> 23:39.042
for quite some time.

23:39.142 --> 23:41.324
Just between
you and me, Reverend,

23:41.424 --> 23:43.325
I think he
and my Jenny...

23:43.425 --> 23:44.126
Really?

23:44.226 --> 23:45.688
Mm-hm.

23:45.788 --> 23:47.049
To you, Mrs. Quinn.

23:47.149 --> 23:47.930
[laughs]

23:48.030 --> 23:49.011
Congratulations.

23:49.111 --> 23:50.292
Thanks.

23:50.392 --> 23:51.253
Mmm.

23:51.353 --> 23:52.374
You know what?

23:52.474 --> 23:54.496
I'm gonna throw
a little garden party,

23:54.596 --> 23:55.937
let him see that we're no
small-town hicks,

23:56.037 --> 23:57.579
and that he could
be happy here.

23:57.679 --> 23:59.100
I hope you can join us.

23:59.200 --> 24:00.061
You're a sweetheart.

24:00.161 --> 24:02.163
Thank you.

24:10.290 --> 24:12.292
What are you
thinking?

24:14.734 --> 24:16.736
I can't wait
to leave Sommerdale.

24:18.618 --> 24:20.399
I feel like
I'm suffocating there.

24:20.499 --> 24:22.501
Well, you can
feel that anywhere.

24:26.385 --> 24:27.406
[sighs]

24:27.506 --> 24:29.288
I mean, try living
in a small town

24:29.388 --> 24:31.650
where your father's a pastor,

24:31.750 --> 24:33.752
and your mother, she...

24:34.472 --> 24:35.613
Your mother, she...

24:35.713 --> 24:36.614
Well, she'd never been young.

24:36.714 --> 24:38.336
That feeling's
pretty universal

24:38.436 --> 24:39.817
when you live
with your parents.

24:39.917 --> 24:43.020
My father is...
he's a good man,

24:43.120 --> 24:44.702
he's just really religious.

24:44.802 --> 24:46.063
Mm-hm.

24:46.163 --> 24:48.505
He has strange ideas, and...

24:48.605 --> 24:50.627
my mother, she says
we have to believe in God,

24:50.727 --> 24:53.009
or else He'll punish us.

24:56.773 --> 24:58.774
Do you believe in God, Harry?

24:59.976 --> 25:02.218
[sighs]

25:10.105 --> 25:12.307
Do you think it's okay
not to love your mother?

25:14.469 --> 25:16.751
Love isn't an obligation.

25:28.241 --> 25:30.243
Hello?

25:31.605 --> 25:33.606
Harry?

25:58.189 --> 25:59.610
Close your eyes.

25:59.710 --> 26:00.531
What?

26:00.631 --> 26:02.013
[giggles]

26:02.113 --> 26:04.555
Put out your hands.

26:06.677 --> 26:07.818
What have you done?

26:07.918 --> 26:10.060
[giggles] You can
open your eyes now.

26:10.160 --> 26:11.221
Why, thank you.

26:11.321 --> 26:12.822
It's from that, um...

26:12.922 --> 26:16.466
that little store
next to the juice bar.

26:16.566 --> 26:17.307
Do you remember that?

26:17.407 --> 26:18.388
Mm-hm.

26:18.488 --> 26:19.469
Just a little something

26:19.569 --> 26:20.630
so you'll never
forget this day.

26:20.730 --> 26:21.631
Oh, I won't.

26:21.731 --> 26:23.732
[giggles]

26:25.214 --> 26:27.076
Oh, wow,
what is this?

26:27.176 --> 26:28.717
It's for putting
dry bread in.

26:28.817 --> 26:30.238
So you can
feed the seagulls.

26:30.338 --> 26:31.199
Oh!

26:31.299 --> 26:32.881
You have to feed
the seagulls, Harry,

26:32.981 --> 26:33.962
it's very important.

26:34.062 --> 26:34.763
All right,
I promise you,

26:34.863 --> 26:35.884
I will
feed the seagulls

26:35.984 --> 26:37.985
every day.

26:43.150 --> 26:45.833
Tell me something sweet.

26:47.274 --> 26:50.437
Tell me I'm your...
your darling Nola.

26:54.841 --> 26:56.062
You're my darling Nola.

26:56.162 --> 26:58.164
Oh--

26:59.645 --> 27:00.586
What?

27:00.686 --> 27:02.708
I can't.

27:02.808 --> 27:04.810
We can't do this.

27:08.413 --> 27:10.415
Talk to me.

27:13.818 --> 27:17.341
We shouldn't
see each other, Nola.

27:22.947 --> 27:25.589
And now it's getting late.

27:27.431 --> 27:30.093
You should go.

27:30.193 --> 27:33.016
It's just...

27:33.116 --> 27:35.118
It's getting late,
and you should go.

27:45.727 --> 27:47.189
I don't want to go.

27:47.289 --> 27:48.750
I know, but you have to go.

27:48.850 --> 27:49.731
Come on, you're gonna
lose the light,

27:49.811 --> 27:51.813
and you need to meet
your friend.

27:53.374 --> 27:55.897
Thank you
for a lovely afternoon.

27:58.779 --> 28:00.781
Thank you.

28:03.224 --> 28:05.225
[mouthing silently]
You have to go.

28:23.242 --> 28:25.724
[starts engine]

28:28.086 --> 28:31.349
I knew it was wrong
to feel the way I felt.

28:31.449 --> 28:35.473
I had to end it,
somehow,

28:35.573 --> 28:38.276
before things
went too far.

28:38.376 --> 28:39.677
How did you?

28:39.777 --> 28:41.278
That was the day
I decided

28:41.378 --> 28:43.380
to distance myself
from Nola for good.

28:45.662 --> 28:46.804
I needed to find somebody

28:46.904 --> 28:49.446
that the world wouldn't
condemn me for loving.

28:49.546 --> 28:52.268
Someone I wouldn't
condemn myself for loving.

28:56.873 --> 28:58.094
Oh, no, it makes
your butt look big.

28:58.194 --> 28:59.255
You don't want
Harry to think

28:59.355 --> 29:00.456
you've been stuffing
yourself, do you?

29:00.556 --> 29:01.417
[groans]

29:01.517 --> 29:02.778
Try something else.

29:02.878 --> 29:04.059
It's a frickin'
nightmare.

29:04.159 --> 29:06.161
Find something else, honey.

29:14.729 --> 29:16.511
What's going on,
honey bunny?

29:16.611 --> 29:17.872
I told you, Bobbo.

29:17.972 --> 29:20.034
Harry Quebert is
taking Jenny to Augusta

29:20.134 --> 29:21.275
to see the fireworks.

29:21.375 --> 29:22.676
Who's Harry Quebert?

29:22.776 --> 29:24.438
The famous writer
from New York,

29:24.538 --> 29:26.400
our resident celebrity.

29:26.500 --> 29:27.281
Now, go change
your clothes,

29:27.381 --> 29:28.282
chop-chop!
[snapping fingers]

29:28.382 --> 29:29.242
I thought we were going

29:29.342 --> 29:29.943
to the neighbors'
barbecue tonight.

29:30.023 --> 29:30.844
We are, but--

29:30.944 --> 29:31.685
It's the 4th of July.

29:31.785 --> 29:32.806
Later, okay?

29:32.906 --> 29:34.247
And please, please,
whatever you do,

29:34.347 --> 29:35.368
don't tell Harry Quebert

29:35.468 --> 29:37.570
that we eat hamburgers
like ordinary people.

29:37.670 --> 29:39.091
But we are
ordinary people,

29:39.191 --> 29:40.453
and I like hamburgers.

29:40.553 --> 29:42.555
You run a hamburger joint.

29:44.356 --> 29:45.337
Hey, and no sitting!

29:45.437 --> 29:46.738
You're gonna
mess everything up.

29:46.838 --> 29:48.380
Do you know how long I spent
cleaning up this dump?

29:48.480 --> 29:50.021
Now, go change.

29:50.121 --> 29:51.062
Into what?

29:51.162 --> 29:52.584
Your suit.

29:52.684 --> 29:54.506
You cannot receive
Harry Quebert

29:54.606 --> 29:56.107
in dirty socks
and underwear.

29:56.207 --> 29:58.029
I have to change
my underwear too?

29:58.129 --> 29:58.950
What--

29:59.050 --> 30:00.711
How's this one?

30:00.811 --> 30:01.752
Beautiful, sweetie.

30:01.852 --> 30:03.874
Like a real live
princess.

30:03.974 --> 30:05.676
You know, I think you
should try the red one.

30:05.776 --> 30:07.077
Okay?

30:07.177 --> 30:07.998
No, really,

30:08.098 --> 30:09.840
it maximizes
your assets!

30:09.940 --> 30:11.441
What the hell
are you doing?

30:11.541 --> 30:13.603
It's 6:50, he's gonna
be here in 10 minutes.

30:13.703 --> 30:14.604
I'm going,
I'm going--

30:14.704 --> 30:15.885
[Jenny]: The red one is stained!

30:15.985 --> 30:17.727
Maybe we can just tell him
I'm sick or something.

30:17.827 --> 30:18.608
[doorbell rings]

30:18.708 --> 30:19.849
Or that I died?

30:19.949 --> 30:21.971
[whispers]
Shit! He's early.

30:22.071 --> 30:23.772
Go on, go!

30:23.872 --> 30:25.054
Go, go, go!

30:25.154 --> 30:27.276
Go, go! Chop-chop!

30:28.797 --> 30:30.799
[sighing]

30:31.960 --> 30:33.661
[chuckles pleasantly]

30:33.761 --> 30:35.543
Hey!

30:35.643 --> 30:36.384
Maggie.

30:36.484 --> 30:37.385
Yeah.

30:37.485 --> 30:38.786
What are you doing here?

30:38.886 --> 30:40.107
It's raffle time.

30:40.207 --> 30:41.469
Oh, the raffle, of course.

30:41.569 --> 30:43.470
Put me down for two books.

30:43.570 --> 30:45.032
-Oh, two books?
-Yeah, yeah.

30:45.132 --> 30:46.393
-Two whole books?
-Yeah.

30:46.493 --> 30:47.354
Oh, thanks.

30:47.454 --> 30:48.435
Well, listen, now,
you go have fun,

30:48.535 --> 30:51.077
and be careful at the fireworks.
I'd hate to see you lose an eye.

30:51.177 --> 30:52.879
Thanks for supporting that gala.

30:52.979 --> 30:55.562
First prize is a trip
to the Adirondacks.

30:55.662 --> 30:56.723
Oh, wouldn't that
be divine.

30:56.823 --> 30:57.603
Yeah!

30:57.703 --> 30:58.564
Listen, I gotta go.

30:58.664 --> 30:59.805
I got a pie in the oven.

30:59.905 --> 31:01.007
I can't smell it.

31:01.107 --> 31:02.448
Oh, you poor thing.

31:02.548 --> 31:03.589
So many people suffering
from allergies these days.

31:03.669 --> 31:05.671
I don't have allergies--

31:11.076 --> 31:13.077
[ringing doorbell]

31:20.564 --> 31:22.386
Nola!

31:22.486 --> 31:24.068
What are you
doing here?

31:24.168 --> 31:25.869
I, um, I thought we could talk.

31:25.969 --> 31:27.150
And-and eat?

31:27.250 --> 31:29.352
I even brought
a bottle of wine.

31:29.452 --> 31:30.514
It is from my father,

31:30.614 --> 31:32.195
but he rarely partakes,

31:32.295 --> 31:34.297
so I don't think he'll miss it.

31:34.897 --> 31:36.519
I was hoping we could picnic
on the beach,

31:36.619 --> 31:38.621
and then find
a secluded spot to talk?

31:39.462 --> 31:41.463
I can't.

31:42.344 --> 31:44.466
I thought
we discussed this.

31:45.908 --> 31:47.909
So I'm not even allowed
to speak to you?

31:49.871 --> 31:51.132
I have to go to Bar Harbor.

31:51.232 --> 31:54.896
My publisher is in Camden
for the 4th.

31:54.996 --> 31:56.017
I'm sorry.

31:56.117 --> 31:58.139
It's gonna be
really boring,

31:58.239 --> 32:00.021
I promise you.

32:00.121 --> 32:01.982
Well...

32:02.082 --> 32:03.384
So, why don't--
Let me, let me...

32:03.484 --> 32:04.625
let me take you home, okay?

32:04.725 --> 32:05.666
No, no, no--

32:05.766 --> 32:06.446
Let me get the keys,
let me get the keys.

32:06.526 --> 32:07.588
No, it's fine,
I-I'll walk.

32:07.688 --> 32:10.190
You don't want to keep
your publisher waiting.

32:10.290 --> 32:12.772
I'm sorry if I bothered you.

32:26.625 --> 32:27.686
Here he comes.

32:27.786 --> 32:29.928
Right on time.

32:30.028 --> 32:31.209
Places, everyone!

32:31.309 --> 32:32.610
Places, everyone.

32:32.710 --> 32:33.571
Jenny, top of the stairs.

32:33.671 --> 32:35.213
Can we just be natural?

32:35.313 --> 32:36.134
[sighing]

32:36.234 --> 32:38.015
Bobbo...

32:38.115 --> 32:40.157
[doorbell rings]

32:41.639 --> 32:42.940
Oh, Mr. Quebert.

32:43.040 --> 32:44.501
Is it
that time already?

32:44.601 --> 32:46.923
Oh, please, come in,
and do forgive the mess.

32:48.004 --> 32:49.025
Jenny!

32:49.125 --> 32:51.688
Mr. Quebert is here.

33:01.857 --> 33:02.878
I'll get your purse.

33:02.978 --> 33:03.719
Okay.

33:03.819 --> 33:04.880
Here you go.

33:04.980 --> 33:05.721
Thanks, Mom.

33:05.821 --> 33:07.162
All right.

33:07.262 --> 33:08.724
<i>[Marcus]: And did it work?</i>

33:08.824 --> 33:10.765
<i>Did going out with Jenny</i>
<i>help take your mind off Nola</i>

33:10.865 --> 33:12.087
<i>like you wanted it to?</i>

33:12.187 --> 33:12.967
Have a good time.

33:13.067 --> 33:14.409
-Yeah, thank you.
-Drive safe.

33:14.509 --> 33:16.050
<i>[Harry]:</i>
<i>No, but I kept trying.</i>

33:16.150 --> 33:19.013
<i>She was a nice girl,</i>
<i>and I knew she liked me,</i>

33:19.113 --> 33:22.216
<i>so I used her,</i>
<i>building her hopes up.</i>

33:22.316 --> 33:24.318
<i>I always felt badly about that.</i>

33:32.565 --> 33:34.787
You have to stop
this investigation, Marcus.

33:34.887 --> 33:36.889
Why would I stop?

33:38.291 --> 33:42.194
Because you're a target,
and I'm worried about you.

33:42.294 --> 33:43.075
Jenny...

33:43.175 --> 33:44.797
I can't leave

33:44.897 --> 33:47.659
until I understand
what happened here 33 years ago.

33:51.863 --> 33:53.945
[sighs]

33:58.629 --> 34:00.371
Wanna take a walk?

34:00.471 --> 34:01.812
Yeah.

34:01.912 --> 34:02.933
Okay, let's go.

34:03.033 --> 34:05.295
When your book,
"G for Goldstein," came out,

34:05.395 --> 34:07.297
oh, my God,
Harry was so proud.

34:07.397 --> 34:09.459
He bought dozens of copies.

34:09.559 --> 34:11.821
Gave them to everyone.

34:11.921 --> 34:13.143
Really?

34:13.243 --> 34:17.867
Then it seemed like
Harry never heard from you.

34:17.967 --> 34:20.189
He pretended not to mind,

34:20.289 --> 34:23.312
but it was like
when you got famous,

34:23.412 --> 34:26.595
you dropped him like a stone.

34:26.695 --> 34:29.758
Yeah, you're right.
I was a shit.

34:29.858 --> 34:32.200
And that's
why I'm here,

34:32.300 --> 34:34.802
to make it up to him.

34:34.902 --> 34:36.084
I thought it was because

34:36.184 --> 34:38.125
your publisher wanted you
to write a book about it.

34:38.225 --> 34:40.828
He does,
and I've refused.

34:42.229 --> 34:43.891
But you have to.

34:43.991 --> 34:47.094
First I say
you shouldn't investigate,

34:47.194 --> 34:48.655
because I was
worried about you,

34:48.755 --> 34:51.298
and now I say
you should write a book.

34:51.398 --> 34:53.780
It's just...

34:53.880 --> 34:55.301
[sighs]

34:55.401 --> 34:58.024
Harry couldn't have done
those things.

34:58.124 --> 35:00.286
You have to tell people
he's not some kind of monster.

35:02.288 --> 35:04.289
You still love him, don't you?

35:05.771 --> 35:07.833
Sorry, I...

35:07.933 --> 35:09.394
I think I could have
made him happy.

35:09.494 --> 35:11.156
[chuckles]

35:11.256 --> 35:14.679
But we don't always get
the lives we want, do we?

35:14.779 --> 35:17.121
I dreamed of being
a movie star,

35:17.221 --> 35:20.084
but all I am is
queen of the French fries.

35:20.184 --> 35:21.285
[chuckles]

35:21.385 --> 35:23.047
But did you ever
suspect back then

35:23.147 --> 35:24.848
that Harry and Nola
could have been...

35:24.948 --> 35:26.570
Never.

35:26.670 --> 35:28.131
She was 15!

35:28.231 --> 35:29.452
The pastor's daughter.

35:29.552 --> 35:31.054
It was unthinkable.

35:31.154 --> 35:32.776
Okay.

35:32.876 --> 35:34.217
Uh, if you don't mind me asking,

35:34.317 --> 35:36.319
was there ever anything
between you and Harry?

35:37.560 --> 35:39.302
Not really.

35:39.402 --> 35:40.583
[chuckles]

35:40.683 --> 35:43.065
Yeah, we went out a few times.

35:43.165 --> 35:46.548
He was very popular
with the women here.

35:46.648 --> 35:48.950
I mean, a celebrity
from New York

35:49.050 --> 35:51.993
turning up
in a place like this...

35:52.093 --> 35:53.114
Uh-huh.

35:53.214 --> 35:55.076
You, um...

35:55.176 --> 35:56.838
you know that
when he came here,

35:56.938 --> 35:59.080
he was actually
nobody, right?

35:59.180 --> 36:00.161
[clears throat]

36:00.261 --> 36:01.682
Yeah, he was
a high school teacher.

36:01.782 --> 36:03.324
He spent
all his savings

36:03.424 --> 36:04.725
to rent that house
at Goose Cove,

36:04.825 --> 36:07.247
come up here, try and
make it as a writer.

36:07.347 --> 36:08.728
I had no idea.

36:08.828 --> 36:11.731
Yeah, when he moved here,
he'd written one novel,

36:11.831 --> 36:12.892
"The Mirror of Life,"

36:12.992 --> 36:15.415
but I mean, God,
it wasn't successful.

36:15.515 --> 36:18.698
No, Harry wasn't famous
until "The Origin of Evil,"

36:18.798 --> 36:22.061
which he wrote, obviously,
after he came here.

36:22.161 --> 36:24.823
[laughs]

36:24.923 --> 36:26.985
Good old Harry!

36:27.085 --> 36:28.947
[laughing]

36:29.047 --> 36:31.509
It was lovely,

36:31.609 --> 36:33.311
but I was living in a dream.

36:33.411 --> 36:35.753
If only I knew then
what I know now.

36:35.853 --> 36:37.315
[chuckles wryly]

36:37.415 --> 36:40.918
But hey, I have a husband
who loves me,

36:41.018 --> 36:43.000
whom I love,

36:43.100 --> 36:45.162
and my burgers are famous

36:45.262 --> 36:47.044
throughout
the State.

36:47.144 --> 36:48.845
My life didn't
turn out too badly.

36:48.945 --> 36:49.966
No.

36:50.066 --> 36:52.068
No, I don't think it did.

36:55.071 --> 36:58.594
Stay on the case, Marcus.

37:05.360 --> 37:07.302
Hey!

37:07.402 --> 37:08.503
I didn't know
where you were.

37:08.603 --> 37:10.605
I'm here now.

37:16.971 --> 37:19.053
[seagulls call overhead]

37:23.577 --> 37:25.519
Whoa!

37:25.619 --> 37:27.160
[gasping]

37:27.260 --> 37:29.042
It's 2008, man.

37:29.142 --> 37:30.083
That thing went out
with the iPod.

37:30.183 --> 37:31.124
Sergeant Gahalowood,

37:31.224 --> 37:33.686
to what do I owe
the honor of this visit?

37:33.786 --> 37:35.568
Well, I, um,

37:35.668 --> 37:37.009
I received a call
from Chief Dawn

37:37.109 --> 37:37.970
about a fire Friday evening?

37:38.070 --> 37:38.891
Yeah.

37:38.991 --> 37:40.533
Yeah, he's worried.

37:40.633 --> 37:42.094
I have to admit
he might have a point.

37:42.194 --> 37:43.055
Well,
that's sweet.

37:43.155 --> 37:43.796
You're worried
about me?

37:43.876 --> 37:44.977
No.

37:45.077 --> 37:46.698
No, not me.

37:46.798 --> 37:47.899
He is.

37:47.999 --> 37:49.781
I'm just here
to make sure

37:49.881 --> 37:51.583
this thing doesn't
degenerate any further.

37:51.683 --> 37:52.464
Uh-huh.

37:52.564 --> 37:53.464
Why didn't you tell me

37:53.564 --> 37:55.146
you'd received
an anonymous letter?

37:55.246 --> 37:56.207
Because you threw me
out of your office,

37:56.287 --> 37:58.289
remember?

38:02.052 --> 38:03.113
Want a beer?

38:03.213 --> 38:04.074
Yeah, man.

38:04.174 --> 38:06.176
Let's go have
a beer, come on.

38:12.422 --> 38:14.484
So how's your
investigation going?

38:14.584 --> 38:15.925
Oh, my investigation?

38:16.025 --> 38:17.326
So now
you're interested.

38:17.426 --> 38:19.128
Well, let's just say

38:19.228 --> 38:20.930
your credibility has skyrocketed

38:21.030 --> 38:23.252
since someone started
threatening you.

38:23.352 --> 38:24.813
Well, I, uh...

38:24.913 --> 38:27.095
I talked to
David Kellergan.

38:27.195 --> 38:29.538
He, um, showed me
Nola's bedroom.

38:29.638 --> 38:30.899
I imagine you've
seen it too.

38:30.999 --> 38:32.180
Yup.

38:32.280 --> 38:33.101
Okay.

38:33.201 --> 38:34.822
If Nola was running away,

38:34.922 --> 38:35.823
how do you explain the fact

38:35.923 --> 38:38.065
she didn't take
anything with her?

38:38.165 --> 38:40.468
Because she wasn't
running away.

38:40.568 --> 38:42.109
Well, okay,
if she was kidnapped,

38:42.209 --> 38:43.871
then why weren't there
any signs of forced entry?

38:43.971 --> 38:46.233
And why would she
take that bag

38:46.333 --> 38:47.794
containing
the manuscript?

38:47.894 --> 38:49.876
Because maybe
she knew her murderer.

38:49.976 --> 38:52.759
Maybe they were even
having an affair.

38:52.859 --> 38:54.520
He appears
at her window,

38:54.620 --> 38:55.962
as he sometimes did,

38:56.062 --> 38:57.803
persuades her
to go with him,

38:57.903 --> 38:59.285
maybe just for a walk--

38:59.385 --> 39:00.206
So that's your theory?

39:00.306 --> 39:02.167
Uh-huh.

39:02.267 --> 39:05.290
Quebert kills the girl,

39:05.390 --> 39:07.893
buries the manuscript
with the body.

39:07.993 --> 39:11.056
Maybe 'cause he was
feeling remorse.

39:11.156 --> 39:12.457
I don't know,

39:12.557 --> 39:13.618
it was a book about their love,

39:13.718 --> 39:14.619
and their love had killed her.

39:14.719 --> 39:16.501
I still think
it's bullshit.

39:16.601 --> 39:17.622
You know, I know Harry.

39:17.722 --> 39:18.983
I know Harry, and-and I don't--

39:19.083 --> 39:21.385
There's an inscription
on the manuscript.

39:21.485 --> 39:24.308
An inscription?
What does it say?

39:24.408 --> 39:25.909
Now, that I can't tell you.

39:26.009 --> 39:27.511
That's confidential.

39:27.611 --> 39:29.793
Don't... Don't
fuck with me, Sergeant.

39:29.893 --> 39:31.795
You can't hide behind
confidentiality

39:31.895 --> 39:33.896
whenever it suits you.

39:37.620 --> 39:41.063
It says, "Goodbye,
darling Nola."

39:44.346 --> 39:46.508

39:51.072 --> 39:52.333

40:40.357 --> 40:41.819
there is sufficient evidence

40:41.919 --> 40:45.342
to try novelist Harry Quebert
on charges of kidnapping

40:45.442 --> 40:47.424

40:58.174 --> 40:59.595
I mean, if he weren't
indicted,

40:59.695 --> 41:01.196
we wouldn't
have access to his file.

41:01.296 --> 41:03.879
Mm-hm.

41:03.979 --> 41:05.280
Oh, shit, this isn't good.

41:05.380 --> 41:07.522
Could you please
stop saying that?

41:07.622 --> 41:08.483
Shit...

41:08.583 --> 41:10.085
-[stammers] Just--
-Yeah, sorry.

41:10.185 --> 41:11.126
No, you're his lawyer, man.

41:11.226 --> 41:12.527
You're supposed
to look at his file,

41:12.627 --> 41:14.048
and you're supposed
to be encouraged.

41:14.148 --> 41:15.850
Uh, well, uh...

41:15.950 --> 41:17.371
these are statements
from the gardeners

41:17.471 --> 41:19.373
who found her remains,

41:19.473 --> 41:20.854
from Harry...

41:20.954 --> 41:22.416
And this one,

41:22.516 --> 41:25.058
from Tamara Quinn...

41:25.158 --> 41:27.621
<i>claiming that she had</i>
<i>concrete evidence</i>

41:27.721 --> 41:30.423
<i>that Harry was infatuated</i>
<i>with Nola,</i>

41:30.523 --> 41:32.745
<i>but, uh, when it disappeared,</i>
<i>no one believed her.</i>

41:32.845 --> 41:35.308
Is that credible testimony?

41:35.408 --> 41:37.350
With a jury?

41:37.450 --> 41:38.310
Yeah.

41:38.410 --> 41:40.072
We don't have anything
to counter it.

41:40.172 --> 41:41.593
Jesus Christ, is there
anything in this file

41:41.693 --> 41:42.875
that doesn't condemn him?

41:42.975 --> 41:44.196
Well...

41:44.296 --> 41:46.338
Maybe this.

41:48.300 --> 41:50.522
Once we get the handwriting
analysis back,

41:50.622 --> 41:53.164
the prosecution's
whole case could crumble

41:53.264 --> 41:55.046
like a house of cards.

41:55.146 --> 41:56.287
With a little luck,

41:56.387 --> 41:58.209
we might not even
have to go to trial.

41:58.309 --> 42:00.050
Yeah, but I mean,
even if it is,

42:00.150 --> 42:02.012
if this is authenticated
as Harry's,

42:02.112 --> 42:03.974
like, even if he did write this,

42:04.074 --> 42:05.816
that doesn't mean
he killed her, right?

42:05.916 --> 42:09.079
What the fuck
are you talking about?

42:13.483 --> 42:15.825
She wanted you to call
her "Darling Nola"?

42:15.925 --> 42:16.786
Yes?

42:16.886 --> 42:18.107
No?

42:18.207 --> 42:19.308
Yes or no?

42:19.408 --> 42:21.110
Yes.

42:23.051 --> 42:24.112
Can you read

42:24.212 --> 42:25.754
what is on the first page

42:25.854 --> 42:27.856
of this goddamn manuscript?

42:28.817 --> 42:30.638
When were you planning
on telling me,

42:30.738 --> 42:31.920
for fuck's sake?

42:32.020 --> 42:34.602
I can assure you,

42:34.702 --> 42:37.024
this is not my writing.

42:39.186 --> 42:43.090
Goddamned coincidences
are fucking bad, Harry,

42:43.190 --> 42:44.851
okay?

42:44.951 --> 42:46.573
I'm not gonna lie
to you, I mean,

42:46.673 --> 42:48.375
the two of you running away
together, the note--

42:48.475 --> 42:50.056
I didn't kill Nola.

42:50.156 --> 42:51.297
How many times
do I have to tell you?

42:51.397 --> 42:52.659
I didn't kill Nola.

42:52.759 --> 42:54.300
I'm not a... a pervert.

42:54.400 --> 42:55.741
I never touched her.

42:55.841 --> 42:57.223
Ever.

42:57.323 --> 42:58.824
We're talking about
a 15-year-old girl.

42:58.924 --> 43:00.586
You feel the same way?

43:00.686 --> 43:02.508
We've been friends
for 10 years, Harry,

43:02.608 --> 43:03.408
you never mentioned
any of this.

43:03.488 --> 43:05.711
Look, if you didn't write this,

43:05.811 --> 43:07.072
then who the fuck did?

43:07.172 --> 43:08.233
I don't know,
I didn't tell her.

43:08.333 --> 43:09.434
Who else...
who else knew

43:09.534 --> 43:10.475
about you and Nola?

43:10.575 --> 43:11.516
Did Tamara Quinn know?

43:11.616 --> 43:13.758
Possibly, I don't know.

43:13.858 --> 43:15.520
Maybe Nola did...
Maybe Nola told

43:15.620 --> 43:17.041
some of her friends
at school.

43:17.141 --> 43:18.482
Maybe her best friend,
Nancy?

43:18.582 --> 43:20.844
I can't defend you
if you hide things from me.

43:20.944 --> 43:22.206
I'm not hiding
anything from you!

43:22.306 --> 43:24.428
[prison guard]: Sir, shh!

43:33.676 --> 43:36.619
Shortly after
Nola disappeared,

43:36.719 --> 43:38.501
I started receiving
these anonymous letters,

43:38.601 --> 43:39.782
and then they stopped

43:39.882 --> 43:41.023
about four or five months
after that.

43:41.123 --> 43:42.825
I don't know why they stopped,
but they stopped.

43:42.925 --> 43:44.146
It didn't cross your mind
to tell me this--

43:44.246 --> 43:45.387
[Roth]: Jesus!

43:45.487 --> 43:46.248
--even when I started
receiving anonymous letters?

43:46.328 --> 43:47.429
I-I didn't--
Look, I am not--

43:47.529 --> 43:49.150
I don't have any idea
what's going on anymore.

43:49.250 --> 43:50.031
Did you keep them?

43:50.131 --> 43:51.473
Yes, of course I kept them.

43:51.573 --> 43:53.995
You know, I don't know
where you get the idea

43:54.095 --> 43:56.557
that this is being forthcoming
with your attorney,

43:56.657 --> 43:58.239
but it isn't.

43:58.339 --> 44:01.241
Don't turn this around on me.

44:01.341 --> 44:03.764
Why am I still
sitting in here?

44:03.864 --> 44:06.626
Why didn't you tell us
about the notes?

44:07.707 --> 44:09.129
You don't think
that's important?

44:09.229 --> 44:10.130
He just told us
about the notes.

44:10.230 --> 44:11.190
He just told us about
the notes, okay?

44:11.271 --> 44:12.372
Let's focus on that.

44:12.472 --> 44:14.534
They're
at Goose Cove?

44:14.634 --> 44:15.735
Yes.

44:15.835 --> 44:18.657
In my office,
in the encyclopedia.

44:18.757 --> 44:19.658
I'll find them. I'll find 'em.

44:19.758 --> 44:21.100
All right.

44:21.200 --> 44:22.501
You have to
believe me.

44:22.601 --> 44:23.582
All right.

44:23.682 --> 44:25.544
They're burning my books.

44:25.644 --> 44:27.465
They're vilifying me.

44:27.565 --> 44:29.567
I'm not this person.

44:31.889 --> 44:33.891
Okay.

45:04.159 --> 45:07.342
Montburry High School
yearbook...

45:07.442 --> 45:09.944
1975.

45:10.044 --> 45:11.346
Nola's class.

45:11.446 --> 45:12.827
There.

45:12.927 --> 45:14.068
That's it,
"Nancy Hattaway."

45:14.168 --> 45:15.269
That's it.

45:15.369 --> 45:17.371
Nancy Hattaway is the one
that Harry mentioned.

45:20.254 --> 45:23.437
[Ernie]: Nancy Hattaway
runs a clothing and quilt shop

45:23.537 --> 45:24.958
on Shore Road,

45:25.058 --> 45:27.500
just south of town.

45:38.551 --> 45:39.932
-Hello.
-Hi.

45:40.032 --> 45:41.133
Can I help you?

45:41.233 --> 45:43.215
Are you Nancy Hattaway?

45:43.315 --> 45:44.696
My name is Marcus Goldman--

45:44.796 --> 45:46.418
The writer.
I've seen your picture.

45:46.518 --> 45:47.339
Yeah.

45:47.439 --> 45:49.140
You're friends
with Harry Quebert.

45:49.240 --> 45:50.381
Yes.

45:50.481 --> 45:52.303
I was hoping I could ask you
a few questions.

45:52.403 --> 45:53.504
I'm under the impression

45:53.604 --> 45:56.027
that you and Nola Kellergan
were good friends

45:56.127 --> 45:57.788
back when you were
in school together.

45:57.888 --> 45:59.190
We were friends

45:59.290 --> 46:01.552
ever since she arrived
in Sommerdale.

46:01.652 --> 46:03.153
We lived almost
next door to each other

46:03.253 --> 46:04.835
on Terrace Avenue.

46:04.935 --> 46:07.517
She spent a lot of time
at our house.

46:07.617 --> 46:10.560
She said she liked to come
because I had a normal family.

46:10.660 --> 46:12.442
"Normal,"
what do you mean?

46:12.542 --> 46:13.923
I assume you've met her father?

46:14.023 --> 46:15.364
Yes.

46:15.464 --> 46:17.486
He's a very
strict man.

46:17.586 --> 46:18.487
Uh-huh.

46:18.587 --> 46:19.528
He'd been recruited

46:19.628 --> 46:21.250
from his parish in Alabama

46:21.350 --> 46:23.652
to revitalize the congregation
here at St. James,

46:23.752 --> 46:25.333
which he did,

46:25.433 --> 46:26.895
big time.

46:26.995 --> 46:29.978
He was quite the fiery orator.

46:30.078 --> 46:32.140
People were
inspired by him.

46:32.240 --> 46:33.181
But...?

46:33.281 --> 46:34.262
But Nola's home life

46:34.362 --> 46:37.304
was not a happy one,

46:37.404 --> 46:39.186
despite all outward
appearances...

46:39.286 --> 46:40.387
[seagulls call overhead]

46:40.487 --> 46:42.189
I'll cover you
while you change,

46:42.289 --> 46:43.390
and then you
cover me, okay?

46:43.490 --> 46:44.671
Okay, but do not look.

46:44.771 --> 46:46.993
I'm self-conscious
about my body.

46:47.093 --> 46:49.335
That's silly, you have
a beautiful body.

46:51.057 --> 46:51.878
Okay, here--

46:51.978 --> 46:52.959
No, I got it!

46:53.059 --> 46:55.061
Nola...

46:55.821 --> 46:59.325
Nola, are those bruises?

46:59.425 --> 47:00.486
No--

47:00.586 --> 47:01.527
Nola, is somebody
beating you?

47:01.627 --> 47:02.728
They're--
They're nothing.

47:02.828 --> 47:04.529
I... I fell
the other day

47:04.629 --> 47:06.631
on my bicycle.

47:07.872 --> 47:11.436
Nola, you can tell me,
it's okay.

47:19.563 --> 47:21.565
It's my mom.

47:22.846 --> 47:26.770
She hit me when I got back
from Bar Harbor on Saturday.

47:28.331 --> 47:29.873
What?

47:29.973 --> 47:32.975
Your mom?

47:34.417 --> 47:38.440
She says I'm a wicked girl.

47:38.540 --> 47:40.963
That's crazy.

47:41.063 --> 47:42.084
What are you
talking about?

47:42.184 --> 47:43.685
She wanted
to teach me a lesson,

47:43.785 --> 47:45.687
and she's right.

47:45.787 --> 47:47.929
I am a wicked girl.

47:48.029 --> 47:50.211
I lied to her
about where I was,

47:50.311 --> 47:53.254
who I was with.

47:53.354 --> 47:56.777
I think you should talk
to someone about this, Nola.

47:56.877 --> 47:58.879
Like the school nurse
or something.

47:59.760 --> 48:01.261
-No, I deserve it.
-No--

48:01.361 --> 48:03.363
-I deserve it!

48:10.850 --> 48:12.852
It's nothing.

48:14.774 --> 48:16.035
Here, I'll--

48:16.135 --> 48:18.157
No, just do not
touch me, okay?

48:18.257 --> 48:20.079
Just... I just want
to put this back on,

48:20.179 --> 48:23.682
and you can still go
in the water, all right?

48:23.782 --> 48:25.123
Okay.

48:25.223 --> 48:26.685
<i>[Marcus]: So you knew</i>
<i>she was seeing someone?</i>

48:26.785 --> 48:28.847
Well, she dropped hints
about him.

48:28.947 --> 48:30.048
I knew he was an older man.

48:30.148 --> 48:31.489
Did you know
it was Harry Quebert?

48:31.589 --> 48:33.411
My God, no.

48:33.511 --> 48:37.054
I found out about Harry on TV,
like everybody else.

48:37.154 --> 48:38.736
But Nola did tell me
about an older man

48:38.836 --> 48:41.258
she was involved with
that summer.

48:41.358 --> 48:42.319
He used to send
his creepy chauffeur

48:42.399 --> 48:43.180
to pick her up.

48:43.280 --> 48:44.741
Do you remember his name?

48:44.841 --> 48:46.383
There's no way
I'd ever forget it.

48:46.483 --> 48:48.485
He's one of the richest men
in Maine.

48:50.847 --> 48:53.529
[âªâªâªâªâª]
