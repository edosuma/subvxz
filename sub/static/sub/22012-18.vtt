WEBVTT

00:02.654 --> 00:05.701
ADULT ADAM: Back in the '80s, there was no more awesome rite of passage than spring break.

00:05.788 --> 00:07.877
Thanks to MTV's infamous
week-long coverage,

00:07.964 --> 00:09.879
every kid in America
wanted to be there.

00:09.966 --> 00:12.229
Beastie Boys!
MTV!

00:12.316 --> 00:13.796
Spring Break!
ALL: '80...

00:13.883 --> 00:18.540
I cannot believe
I'm spending spring break
in sucky Jenkintown

00:18.627 --> 00:20.977
instead of on
a Fort Lauderdale beach
the way God intended.

00:21.064 --> 00:23.240
I heard that the beer
flows like water down there.

00:23.327 --> 00:26.461
Like, literally, you turn
the faucet on and boom!
Beer!

00:26.548 --> 00:29.681
That's 'cause all their water
is reserved for
wet T-shirt contests.

00:29.768 --> 00:31.074
ERICA: The city
of Fort Lauderdale

00:31.161 --> 00:33.685
actually elected
Spuds MacKenzie
as their mayor!

00:33.772 --> 00:36.819
America's favorite party dog
is their mayor?

00:36.906 --> 00:38.429
How could we not
be in Florida right now?

00:38.516 --> 00:40.910
Wait a minute... Florida.
That's it!

00:42.694 --> 00:44.392
Look!
Pops sent us a postcard

00:44.479 --> 00:46.742
from his condo complex
in Fort Lauderdale!

00:46.829 --> 00:48.657
That's ground zero
for all the horniness!

00:48.744 --> 00:50.528
Damn it, why didn't I
actually read his card

00:50.615 --> 00:52.530
instead of automatically
throwing it in the garbage?

00:52.617 --> 00:56.056
Look, Pops says his place
has a beach house
and a pool with a bar!

00:56.143 --> 00:58.884
We had MTV Spring Break
under our nose
and didn't even know it.

00:58.971 --> 01:00.669
We got to get there.
True, but how?

01:00.756 --> 01:02.758
Question...
Can you cry hysterically?

01:02.845 --> 01:05.587
Oh, for sure.
It's well established
I'm an emotional time bomb.

01:05.674 --> 01:06.805
Follow me.

01:06.892 --> 01:09.504
I just miss Pops so much

01:09.591 --> 01:12.289
that I can't stop
the sad water dripping
from my eye holes.

01:12.376 --> 01:14.161
And now I'm crying
'cause you're crying.

01:14.248 --> 01:16.250
I miss him, too, Bar.

01:16.337 --> 01:17.947
Wait, this gives me
a fresh idea.

01:18.034 --> 01:19.557
What if
we went to visit him?

01:19.644 --> 01:22.691
Please, Mom? Let me see
my grandpapa in Georgia?

01:22.778 --> 01:23.822
Florida, honey.

01:23.909 --> 01:25.476
Ugh, so swampy.

01:25.563 --> 01:27.565
Oh, well, this is
about Pops and not us.

01:27.652 --> 01:29.872
Well, then, it's decided.
Look out, world!

01:29.959 --> 01:31.961
The Goldbergs
are going to Florida!

01:32.048 --> 01:33.528
ADULT ADAM: Oh, yes!

01:33.615 --> 01:36.531
Erica and Barry's spring break dreams were happening!

01:36.618 --> 01:37.706
MURRAY: Stop!
Oh, no, wait, here's Murray.

01:37.793 --> 01:39.316
Nobody speak.

01:39.403 --> 01:42.276
There's no way I'm paying
for all you morons

01:42.363 --> 01:45.017
to go gallivanting
around the sub-tropics.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.107
You weren't even in the room.
How do you know what's
going on?

01:47.194 --> 01:48.673
I heard money
being spent!

01:48.760 --> 01:50.501
Well, there is one way
this trip

01:50.588 --> 01:52.416
could cost you a fraction
of the price.

01:52.503 --> 01:53.548
Well, that's what
I want to do.

01:53.635 --> 01:55.898
That thing.
Whatever her cheap idea is.

01:55.985 --> 01:59.162
ADULT ADAM: And so Erica and Barry scored the ultimate spring break...

01:59.249 --> 02:00.250
One without parents.

02:00.337 --> 02:03.427
Spring break
is awesome!

02:03.514 --> 02:05.951
I saw a girl wearing a bikini
on the plane!

02:06.038 --> 02:07.953
It was unsanitary,
but she went for it.Damn.

02:08.040 --> 02:10.217
We're not in Jenkintown
anymore, Goldbergs.

02:10.304 --> 02:11.653
Welcome to spring break.

02:11.740 --> 02:15.309
Whoa! A female body inspector?
Where do you train?

02:15.396 --> 02:16.745
Wherever
female bodies are.

02:16.832 --> 02:18.703
See you fools on the beach.

02:18.790 --> 02:21.445
Really hoping this year
I get to make out with a
Beastie Boy. Fingers crossed!

02:21.532 --> 02:23.447
This is gonna be so rad!
The raddest!

02:23.534 --> 02:26.058
Lucky for you,
the party has arrived!

02:26.146 --> 02:27.712
BOTH: Spring break!

02:27.799 --> 02:30.367
ALL: Spring break!
Spring break! Spring break!

02:35.111 --> 02:37.331
ADULT ADAM:
It was spring break
1980-something,

02:37.418 --> 02:39.507
which typically meant
one thing in Jenkintown...

02:39.594 --> 02:41.552
Damn cold front moving in.

02:41.639 --> 02:43.337
I meant to pull out
the ol' compression socks,

02:43.424 --> 02:44.642
keep that foot blood
moving.

02:44.729 --> 02:46.035
Know what else
is good for the cold?

02:47.906 --> 02:49.734
Mink, sable, fox...
Fur in general.

02:49.821 --> 02:52.172
Yep, back before
we cared about tiny animals,

02:52.259 --> 02:55.349
the fur coat was coveted
by every yenta in America.

02:55.436 --> 02:57.612
What is this?
What are you
jamming in my face?

02:57.699 --> 03:00.745
Just a luxurious coat
that shows off how much
my husband loves me.

03:00.832 --> 03:02.225
How many coats do ya need?

03:02.312 --> 03:03.879
I got you that brown one
with the hood.

03:03.966 --> 03:05.707
That was
eight years ago!

03:05.794 --> 03:08.579
And so, my mom's quest
for the coat began.

03:08.666 --> 03:10.451
It started with
the subliminal messages.

03:10.538 --> 03:14.629
Beverly deserves a fur coat to
show her how I feel and stuff.

03:17.066 --> 03:20.156
Soon, the hints got
less subtle and just
became ugly demands.

03:20.243 --> 03:23.115
For the love of God,
just buy me a stinkin'
fur coat already!

03:23.203 --> 03:25.292
Since when
do you want a fur coat?

03:25.379 --> 03:29.426
I've been dropping hints
and serving extra meaty dishes
for six months!

03:29.513 --> 03:30.688
Well, you could've
just asked.

03:30.775 --> 03:32.864
I would've said no
a long time ago.

03:32.951 --> 03:35.911
You do know that
Essie and Ginzy and Linda
all have them, right?

03:35.998 --> 03:37.826
I don't know
who those people are.

03:37.913 --> 03:39.088
They're my best friends.
You've had dinner with them
many times.

03:39.175 --> 03:40.611
But it's fine!

03:40.698 --> 03:42.613
I don't need a warm
luxury jacket.

03:42.700 --> 03:44.615
I'll just go out in the cold
and freeze to death.

03:50.012 --> 03:50.969
What's that?

03:51.056 --> 03:52.841
It's a fur coat!

03:52.928 --> 03:54.712
I know.
I bought it for you.

03:54.799 --> 03:56.845
Oh, why did you
buy it for me?

03:56.932 --> 03:58.934
'Cause I wanted to show you
how I feel and stuff.

03:59.021 --> 04:01.110
It's a fur coat!

04:01.197 --> 04:03.982
It's a fur...coat!

04:04.069 --> 04:06.594
It's a fur...coat!

04:06.681 --> 04:09.031
A fur coat!
A fur coat!

04:09.118 --> 04:10.946
In case it wasn't clear,
it was a fur coat.

04:11.033 --> 04:13.427
It's a fur  coat!

04:13.514 --> 04:16.647
Ooh, I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love you,
I love you, I love you!

04:16.734 --> 04:19.084
She loved the coat and
she made sure everyone
knew it.

04:19.171 --> 04:20.303
Beverly, we're starting.

04:20.390 --> 04:21.609
Sure you don't want to
lose the top layer?

04:21.696 --> 04:23.567
I'm fine.
Thank you.

04:23.654 --> 04:25.395
My husband bought me
a fur coat.

04:25.482 --> 04:27.179
He does very well
for himself.

04:27.267 --> 04:30.531
It's safe to say the coat paid off just as much for my dad.

04:30.618 --> 04:33.447
There you go. Rib pot pie
with no peas or carrots.

04:33.534 --> 04:35.710
It's just crust
and meat!

04:35.797 --> 04:37.059
Thank you!

04:37.146 --> 04:39.148
Don't thank me.
Thank Minky.

04:39.235 --> 04:41.585
"You're welcome.
I was a great gift!"

04:41.672 --> 04:43.283
And one that could
help me, too.

04:43.370 --> 04:45.502
It is a great gift!

04:45.589 --> 04:47.504
Even though
it's a sad dead animal

04:47.591 --> 04:48.984
whose spirit still
haunts that dead pelt.

04:49.071 --> 04:50.333
I'd like to borrow it.

04:50.420 --> 04:52.509
Boofaloo, I love you
just as much as this coat,

04:52.596 --> 04:54.424
but there's no way I'm ever
taking it off my body.

04:54.511 --> 04:56.078
What if I told you
there's a way

04:56.165 --> 04:58.167
Minky can be on
national television

04:58.254 --> 05:00.691
and discussed by consistent
working actor Jack Palance?

05:00.778 --> 05:03.128
He's in all those Westerns
and other stuff. Go on!

05:03.215 --> 05:05.609
There's a new show called
Ripley's Believe It or Not!

05:05.696 --> 05:07.219
And I have a surefire way
to get on it.

05:07.307 --> 05:10.484
But it all hinges on your
amazing,
deeply upsetting coat.

05:10.571 --> 05:14.401
Nothing would fill my friends
with more red-hot jealousy
than my coat being famous.

05:14.488 --> 05:15.706
So it's a yes?

05:15.793 --> 05:18.361
Not just yet.
I have terms.

05:18.448 --> 05:21.451
Giving you my prized Minky
is done only with the
understanding

05:21.538 --> 05:22.931
that I trust you
as an adult.

05:23.018 --> 05:24.498
An adult? Wow.
Big step.

05:24.585 --> 05:27.936
Go make my coat a star,
Schmoo.

05:28.023 --> 05:31.243
So, we're saying Bigfoot was
spotted in suburban Philly?

05:31.331 --> 05:32.636
That's the beauty
of the show...

05:32.723 --> 05:35.204
It's up to them
to believe it or not.

05:35.291 --> 05:36.945
Please,
no one in their right mind

05:37.032 --> 05:39.513
would ever buy that
Sasquatch hangs near a Wawa.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.558
Aah!
Bigfoot lives among us!

05:42.167 --> 05:43.473
Balls!

05:43.560 --> 05:45.519
Ah! I've angered it!

05:45.606 --> 05:46.955
Balls!

05:47.042 --> 05:49.131
ADULT ADAM:
As my mom's pelt was pelted,

05:49.218 --> 05:51.742
Erica and Barry were ready
to hit spring break.

05:51.829 --> 05:54.745
Welcome to the Manners
of Envurrary, kiddos.

05:54.832 --> 05:57.400
My red-hot
winter retreat.

05:57.487 --> 05:59.359
This here's
our beach club.

05:59.446 --> 06:01.709
Yeah,
where is the beach?

06:01.796 --> 06:03.928
Thirty minutes.
By car.

06:04.015 --> 06:05.147
Which I don't own.

06:05.234 --> 06:06.714
'Cause I can't drive.

06:06.801 --> 06:09.630
Tell your grandkids
no splashing

06:09.717 --> 06:12.372
or running
or yelling or horseplay.

06:12.459 --> 06:14.243
That's Itzel
playing cribbage.

06:14.330 --> 06:16.419
I'm handling it, Itzel!

06:16.506 --> 06:18.073
Try to steer clear
of Itzel.

06:20.075 --> 06:22.904
Sorry, the cigar smog
makes me queasy.

06:22.991 --> 06:24.296
Can we go to the pool?

06:24.384 --> 06:25.776
ADULT ADAM: It was now clear they weren't

06:25.863 --> 06:27.952
in the spring break
seen on MTV.

06:28.039 --> 06:29.998
This was the grandparent
part of Florida,

06:30.085 --> 06:31.782
filled with
the oldest of farts.

06:31.869 --> 06:33.001
Here's a knish.

06:33.088 --> 06:34.959
It's all they had
at the snack bar.

06:35.046 --> 06:37.919
A knish?
A fried dough pocket
filled with potatoes and oil.

06:38.006 --> 06:40.574
I know what a knish is.
It's the last thing
I want to eat in the sun.

06:40.661 --> 06:42.619
We have no choice!

06:42.706 --> 06:44.099
Let's just sit
and lay low...

06:44.186 --> 06:45.492
We can't sit.

06:45.579 --> 06:47.842
This little footrest
is all I could find for us.

06:47.929 --> 06:51.019
The old fart altacockers
get up at the crack of dawn
to reserve chairs.

06:51.106 --> 06:53.630
I'm not waking up at the crack
of dawn for a pool chair.

06:53.717 --> 06:54.805
We have to, Barry.

06:54.892 --> 06:57.155
From now on,
we come here at 5:00 a.m.

06:57.242 --> 06:59.680
and sit on a chaise in the
darkness until the day starts.

06:59.767 --> 07:02.160
Screw that!
I'll just float
all day in the pool.

07:02.247 --> 07:04.511
No. Rafts and kickboards
are against the rules.

07:04.598 --> 07:06.295
Same goes for running,
chicken fighting,

07:06.382 --> 07:08.036
diving,
and cannon-balling.

07:08.123 --> 07:10.342
But that's my signature entry
into the water!

07:10.430 --> 07:13.171
Hey, kiddo, we need to
talk about the rules
if you want to go swimming.

07:13.258 --> 07:15.870
You got to wear
the required bathing cap.

07:15.957 --> 07:18.350
No, I'm not gonna wear
a required bathing cap.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.657
You got to wear
the required bathing cap.

07:20.744 --> 07:22.616
Look at all that hair,
Albert!

07:22.703 --> 07:24.966
I'm handling it,
Itzel!

07:25.053 --> 07:26.750
That's all gonna end up
in the filter

07:26.837 --> 07:28.883
if she doesn't wear
the required bathing cap!

07:28.970 --> 07:31.712
You got to wear
the required bathing cap.

07:31.799 --> 07:33.278
Let me help!
Ow, ow, ow!

07:33.365 --> 07:35.759
Okay! It's on fine!
Oh, you look great.

07:35.846 --> 07:38.545
Like a beautiful,
non-slip shower mat.

07:38.632 --> 07:40.590
ADULT ADAM: Yep,
the once-promising trip
to Florida

07:40.677 --> 07:42.766
was looking like
a colossal bust.

07:42.853 --> 07:45.377
And back home,
my friends were helping me
to avoid getting busted.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.467
This isn't working.
Oh, man!

07:47.554 --> 07:49.207
We got to fix this or
my parents are gonna kill us!

07:49.294 --> 07:50.382
Oh, God.
I'll go get Erica.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.384
She's in Florida
on spring break.

07:52.472 --> 07:55.344
Wait, my girlfriend
went to MTV Spring Break
and didn't even tell me?

07:55.431 --> 07:56.998
Sounds like
trouble in paradise.

07:57.085 --> 07:58.608
Dave Kim
smells a door opening.

07:58.695 --> 08:00.305
What?
I'm not gonna
hide my feelings, bro.

08:00.392 --> 08:01.698
I'm actively
rooting against you.

08:01.785 --> 08:03.091
What's that smell?

08:03.178 --> 08:04.222
Fire.
Fire?

08:04.309 --> 08:05.310
Fire!

08:05.397 --> 08:06.398
There's fire on the coat!

08:06.486 --> 08:08.444
I see the fire,
Dave Kim!

08:08.531 --> 08:10.881
ADULT ADAM:
With ninja-like reflexes,
I dealt with the blaze.

08:10.968 --> 08:12.970
And in the process,
I killed Minky.

08:13.057 --> 08:15.364
I just destroyed the one thing
my mother loves more than me.

08:15.451 --> 08:17.366
What do I do?
I'd blame Lucky.

08:17.453 --> 08:19.934
Just say that she ripped it
to shreds and then burned it.

08:20.021 --> 08:22.414
Just blame Geoff.
He's not gonna be around much
after the break-up.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.329
Here's
an even crazier idea.

08:24.416 --> 08:25.853
I don't lie
or blame anyone.

08:25.940 --> 08:27.332
But what other option
is there?

08:27.419 --> 08:30.031
I tell the truth.

08:30.118 --> 08:31.902
I don't understand
a word you're saying.

08:31.989 --> 08:34.644
My mom gave me
the coat 'cause she finally
thinks I'm an adult.

08:34.731 --> 08:38.213
So I'll do the adult thing
and just apologize
for this awful accident.

08:38.300 --> 08:40.215
Honesty.
Huh.

08:40.302 --> 08:42.957
Interesting.
It's so crazy
it just might work.

08:43.044 --> 08:44.611
You have any idea how much
it cost to get a fur coat?

08:44.698 --> 08:46.961
You have broken
the unbreakable bond
between a mother and child!

08:47.048 --> 08:49.137
578 hours of me working myself
to the bone just so my wife...

08:49.224 --> 08:51.835
I have failed as a mother
for raising such a careless,
inconsiderate little boy...

08:51.922 --> 08:54.272
They don't seem to appreciate
the honesty idea.

08:54.359 --> 08:57.667
They will soon.
I just got to take my lumps
and then we'll all move on.

08:57.754 --> 08:59.321
[MURRAY AND BEVERLY
YELLING INDISTINCTLY]They still mad?

08:59.408 --> 09:01.845
Very.
No more TV. No more movies.
No more Walkmans.

09:01.932 --> 09:03.064
Gone! Gone!
Tell him things, Bevy!

09:03.151 --> 09:04.935
Or G.I. Jims.
She's telling you!

09:05.022 --> 09:07.895
But I'm sure they'll
start to value my honesty
any minute now.

09:07.982 --> 09:09.984
You never even liked Minky!
You like making
movies, right?

09:10.071 --> 09:12.160
Well, I'll show you a movie!
All you ever saw was some
poor, dead animal

09:12.247 --> 09:13.814
sewn together for my...
Your dad driving
to the bank...

09:13.901 --> 09:15.685
Oh, sweet God,
this has to stop!

09:16.556 --> 09:18.383
Excuse me?

09:18.470 --> 09:21.169
I am the only child in history
who did the adult thing

09:21.256 --> 09:23.911
and took full responsibility
for my mistakes!

09:23.998 --> 09:26.174
I get you're mad,
but enough already!

09:26.261 --> 09:28.698
Hey! We'll say when
we're done, big shot!

09:28.785 --> 09:30.700
Don't you walk away
from your father!

09:30.787 --> 09:32.615
You take one more step,
and it's over!

09:32.702 --> 09:34.225
Murray!
He took one more step!

09:34.312 --> 09:37.011
Hey, mister, stop walking
or it's curtains for you!

09:37.098 --> 09:38.969
He's still walking,
Bevy!

09:39.056 --> 09:41.493
Wrestle him to the ground.
Use your hips and groin
to pin him down!

09:41.581 --> 09:43.539
No, I'm not gonna do that.
Stop!

09:43.626 --> 09:44.975
He didn't listen
when I yelled.

09:45.062 --> 09:46.542
That's my only move
as a parent.

09:46.629 --> 09:48.675
It's as if
we lost all our power.

09:51.025 --> 09:52.722
We've lost all our power.

09:52.809 --> 09:54.898
ADULT ADAM:
As my parents lost control,

09:54.985 --> 09:56.987
Barry and Erica
were trying to steer
spring break back on track.

09:57.074 --> 09:59.599
Was that a hearty soup
or what?

09:59.686 --> 10:01.470
And a bottomless bowl!

10:01.557 --> 10:03.951
Got to love
that early bird dinner.

10:04.038 --> 10:06.562
Oh, yeah. That soup
was so rich and beany.

10:06.649 --> 10:08.999
Yeah.
Also, this place sucks!

10:09.086 --> 10:10.479
The fact that
you don't get it means

10:10.566 --> 10:12.437
that this place is turning you
into one of them, man.

10:12.524 --> 10:15.658
Stop. I'm the same Party Pops
you've always known!

10:15.745 --> 10:17.660
If that's true,
then take my hand.

10:17.747 --> 10:19.444
Come with us, Party Pops.

10:19.531 --> 10:22.404
Join us on the brown, sandy
beaches of Fort Lauderdale.

10:22.491 --> 10:24.232
It'll be strange to
bring our grandfather

10:24.319 --> 10:27.148
to an inflatable dance club,
but we'll do it together.

10:27.235 --> 10:28.889
As a family.

10:28.976 --> 10:30.455
Why aren't you
taking my hand?

10:30.542 --> 10:32.501
I'm sorry,
but no one's going to

10:32.588 --> 10:35.373
some farkakte beach party
at this hour!

10:35.460 --> 10:36.679
Then where
are you going?

10:36.766 --> 10:39.856
To bed,
and so should you.

10:39.943 --> 10:42.467
It's 5:50.
The sun is right there.

10:42.554 --> 10:44.774
This is just wrong!

10:44.861 --> 10:48.256
Carla and Johnny Atkins
are partying poolside
with the Beastie Boys,

10:48.343 --> 10:50.388
and we're stuck in
this geriatric nightmare.

10:50.475 --> 10:52.695
If Pops won't let us
go to MTV Spring Break,

10:52.782 --> 10:55.263
then we'll just have to
bring MTV Spring Breakto us.

broke into the pool

and are throwing a party.

11:40.177 --> 11:41.918
How big of a party

200 kids.

These damn punks are gonna
get what's coming to them.

11:52.668 --> 11:55.236
Check it! I just spent
the last four hours

11:55.323 --> 11:58.805
creating brand-new
punishments to remind
Adam we're in charge.

11:58.892 --> 12:01.068
"No video games,
no smiley pancakes,

12:01.155 --> 12:03.723
"no pillow forts,
no acting in
school musicals..."

12:03.810 --> 12:06.377
Strike that one.
I can't deprive the world
of his brilliance.

12:06.464 --> 12:09.293
You realize he's just gonna
say no again and walk out?

12:09.380 --> 12:11.774
But why?
Barry and Erica
never did that.

12:11.861 --> 12:13.907
'Cause they were always guilty
as hell, and they knew it.

12:13.994 --> 12:15.735
You're right.

12:15.822 --> 12:17.824
Adam's my perfect
little snuggle monkey
who told the truth,

12:17.911 --> 12:18.999
and we just yelled
for days.

12:19.086 --> 12:21.175
Come on.
All kids are the worst.

12:21.262 --> 12:23.177
I guarantee Adam is
guilty of something.

12:23.264 --> 12:26.093
So we just need to figure out
what he's hiding from us.

12:26.180 --> 12:28.269
And then we bust him

12:28.356 --> 12:31.707
and we make him feel guilty
and bad about himself!

12:31.794 --> 12:33.535
And then
he listens to us again.

12:33.622 --> 12:35.929
I'm really excited
about this plan.

12:36.016 --> 12:38.148
It's a great plan,
and we're great parents.

12:38.235 --> 12:39.454
We are great parents.

12:57.037 --> 12:58.734
That's not good.
It doesn't matter.

12:58.821 --> 13:00.518
All that matters
is what's in this box.

13:01.911 --> 13:04.435
There's a note.
I can't look. Read it.

Oh, that damn honest moron.

It's actually, uh,
Father's Day gift ideas.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.965
Now what?
Well, we do
exactly what Adam would.

13:12.052 --> 13:13.923
Be adults
and come clean.

13:17.013 --> 13:18.623
We were robbed!

13:18.710 --> 13:20.451
What?
Enough with the questions!

13:20.538 --> 13:22.889
Can't you see
your mom's a mess?

13:22.976 --> 13:25.674
ADULT ADAM: As I was caught
in my parents' web of lies,

13:25.761 --> 13:28.459
a spring break rager
was cooking at Pop's place.

13:28.546 --> 13:31.462
Another round of knishes
coming up because that's
what I do.

13:31.549 --> 13:34.814
Look at me! My body's
on four different chaises,

13:34.901 --> 13:36.990
and I didn't even have to
use a towel to reserve 'em!

13:37.077 --> 13:39.122
Freeze! Everyone down!
Down!

13:39.209 --> 13:41.081
Don't shoot!
I'm all potential!

13:41.168 --> 13:44.127
We got a call about
an out-of-control party!
Where is everyone?

13:44.214 --> 13:47.304
It's just me
and no one else.
I swear.

13:52.266 --> 13:54.877
We see you reaching for
the little microwave handle.
Come out now.

13:57.184 --> 13:58.794
She's not coming.
Send in the dogs.

13:58.881 --> 13:59.969
No dogs! I'm here.
I'm coming out.

14:00.056 --> 14:01.057
What's in your hand?
Drop it!

14:01.144 --> 14:03.059
A knish!
It's just a knish!

14:03.146 --> 14:04.931
Sweet Mother of Mercy,
I hate Florida!

14:05.018 --> 14:06.454
ADULT ADAM:
Yep, it's true.

14:06.541 --> 14:08.499
My siblings were America's
first knish bandits.

14:08.586 --> 14:11.024
Meanwhile, I was facing
an actual crime scene.

14:11.111 --> 14:13.330
Balls!
Oh, God, oh, balls!

14:13.417 --> 14:14.941
I can't believe
we were robbed!

14:15.028 --> 14:18.901
We really were.
Those robbers came in
and robbed us real bad.

14:18.988 --> 14:20.598
So they found
all your jewelry?

14:20.685 --> 14:23.950
Uh, no, no. They, uh,
mostly just focused on
this room, but, uh...

14:24.037 --> 14:27.823
They broke all your toys
and your tiny Donkey Kong
machine.

14:27.910 --> 14:31.087
But why?
Adam, these are bad people.

14:31.174 --> 14:33.655
Yes.
Bad people.

14:33.742 --> 14:36.440
There's no point in trying to
figure out why they did this.

14:36.527 --> 14:37.833
They left my piggy bank.

14:37.920 --> 14:38.921
It's just loose change.

14:39.008 --> 14:40.923
And Pops'
coin collection?

14:41.010 --> 14:42.533
I think they were just
trying to send a message.

14:42.620 --> 14:44.231
And the message is,

14:44.318 --> 14:45.928
"Don't ask any more questions
about this crime."

14:46.015 --> 14:48.235
We got to
call the police.

14:48.322 --> 14:50.063
No. If you call the police,
they said they'd come back
and kill you.

14:50.150 --> 14:51.412
What?
What?

14:51.499 --> 14:53.109
You talked to them?
They left a note!

14:53.196 --> 14:54.719
Where is it?
That's evidence.

14:54.806 --> 14:56.765
It was written in blood
on the wall!

14:56.852 --> 14:59.376
I don't want to live here
anymore!

14:59.463 --> 15:01.596
You don't need
to be scared.

15:01.683 --> 15:07.167
You are a sweet boy
who wants to buy batteries for
his father for Father's Day.

15:07.254 --> 15:09.909
Wait. How do you know
I was gonna buy batteries
for Father's Day?

15:12.650 --> 15:16.263
The robbers said so.
It was in their blood message
scrawled above your bed.

15:16.350 --> 15:17.699
So troubling.

15:17.786 --> 15:19.614
It was your
mother's idea.My idea?

15:19.701 --> 15:22.008
It was you.

15:22.095 --> 15:25.576
You guys ransacked my room
and broke my tiny
Donkey Kongmachine

15:25.663 --> 15:27.491
and then lied about it!

15:27.578 --> 15:30.451
When I messed up,
I told the truth like
an adult.

15:30.538 --> 15:32.148
You'd think my parents
could do the same thing.

15:32.235 --> 15:34.498
Exactly...
We're the parents.

15:34.585 --> 15:37.110
That means when we say
you're grounded,
you don't walk out the door.

15:37.197 --> 15:39.764
If anyone is grounded here,
it's you guys.

15:39.851 --> 15:43.029
Now go to your room
and think about what
you've done.

15:43.116 --> 15:46.423
You think you can
just go around
punishing us like...

15:49.818 --> 15:51.124
I'm going to my room.

15:51.211 --> 15:53.822
But not to think about
what I've done!

15:55.128 --> 15:56.129
Go!

15:59.219 --> 16:00.960
I can't believe this.

16:01.047 --> 16:02.962
We were supposed
to be having the craziest
week of our lives.

16:03.049 --> 16:05.094
I know!

16:05.181 --> 16:07.227
I was finally gonna live out
my number-one dream
of riding a sea turtle.

16:07.314 --> 16:08.924
You two are so lame.

16:09.011 --> 16:10.970
How can anyone not love
spring break?

16:11.057 --> 16:13.189
Please don't tell me
that you got to party
with the Beastie Boys?

16:13.276 --> 16:15.844
No. But I did barf
on Larry "Bud" Melman!

16:15.931 --> 16:17.933
Whoa.
Whoa.

16:18.020 --> 16:19.239
I stole a jet ski
and then I got chased
by the Coast Guard

16:19.326 --> 16:21.415
and then I crashed
the jet ski into a pier.

16:21.502 --> 16:23.156
I'm lucky to be alive.
It was so funny.

16:23.243 --> 16:24.809
That is funny.
So cool.

16:24.896 --> 16:26.072
So what'd the po-po
snag you guys for?

16:27.769 --> 16:30.772
You know, just, uh, typical
spring break craziness.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.688
We, um
stole a knish.

16:33.775 --> 16:34.689
What'd you say?
Can't hear you, bro.

16:34.776 --> 16:36.082
Stole a kni...

16:36.169 --> 16:36.996
What?
Enunciate!

16:37.083 --> 16:38.998
We stole a knish,
okay?

16:39.085 --> 16:41.652
Like,
from a wet T

16:41.739 --> 16:44.394
Nope. Just a regular ol' knish
at a retirement home.

16:44.481 --> 16:45.874
You stole from old people,
dude?

16:45.961 --> 16:47.267
That's not cool.
My step-dad's old.

16:47.354 --> 16:49.312
Goldberg and Goldberg,
you're free to go.

16:49.399 --> 16:50.618
Pops, thank God!
We're saved!

16:50.705 --> 16:52.402
You kiddos okay?

16:52.489 --> 16:56.189
No! Some grumpy-ass altacocker
called the 5-0 on us.

16:56.276 --> 16:59.844
Whoever ratted us out
is the lamest old fart
of all the farts.

16:59.931 --> 17:02.456
Or he's not
a lame fart at all.
We don't know.

17:02.543 --> 17:03.761
I bet you
it was that putz Itzel.

17:03.848 --> 17:05.241
It was for sure Itzel!

17:05.328 --> 17:07.200
It was me, okay?

17:07.287 --> 17:08.723
Why are you
protecting Itzel?

17:08.810 --> 17:11.204
I'm not!
It was a mistake.

17:11.291 --> 17:14.033

So, the knish incident...

21:07.266 --> 21:09.006
We had nothing to do
in the evening,

outside say, "Send in the
