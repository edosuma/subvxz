32:17.598 --> 32:19.728
- No.
- Well, that's a first.

32:19.765 --> 32:21.325
Shane, the statement
that you gave the police?

32:21.361 --> 32:23.055
It doesn't line up with Taylor's.

32:23.114 --> 32:24.796
I told them everything I saw.

32:24.833 --> 32:26.214
Maybe you should talk to her.

32:26.251 --> 32:28.385
She said she stayed
in her room all night.

32:28.422 --> 32:31.065
- You said you saw her in the hallway.
- Who said that?

32:31.102 --> 32:32.382
I didn't see Taylor. I never said that.

32:32.418 --> 32:34.577
You said you saw the girl

32:34.622 --> 32:37.228
- who was staying at the motel.
- Yeah, but not Taylor.

32:37.426 --> 32:39.313
It was another girl
that was staying there.

32:39.998 --> 32:41.314
Describe her.

32:41.378 --> 32:45.007
- You said 'girl'. How young?
- I dunno, twenties?

32:45.505 --> 32:47.385
She was staying there!
She had one of the motel's towels.

32:47.421 --> 32:48.901
So why didn't you put
that in your statement?

32:48.938 --> 32:50.075
They said they talked to her!

32:50.112 --> 32:51.255
Billy.

32:51.354 --> 32:53.542
A towel was missing
from my father's room.

32:53.606 --> 32:55.874
- What time did you see her?
- I don't know. Ten maybe?

32:56.107 --> 32:58.498
- Ten?!
- Nine? I dunno.

32:58.535 --> 32:59.781
It was right after I checked in.

32:59.846 --> 33:02.630
OK, the motel should have Shane's
check-in time logged in their computer.

33:02.717 --> 33:05.221
This is an eyewitness
account of another suspect.

33:05.316 --> 33:07.858
We have to get this to the
Crown before the trial starts.

33:08.421 --> 33:11.390
This would be a major
screw-up for the police.

33:12.323 --> 33:15.764
They didn't confirm an
eyewitness' statement.

33:15.835 --> 33:17.195
Imagine that leaking to the media?

33:17.407 --> 33:19.808
[CAR DOOR CLOSING]

33:25.854 --> 33:28.507
- This a good time?
- Yeah, always.

33:28.880 --> 33:31.508
What DNA evidence was
listed in discovery?

33:31.619 --> 33:33.644
Other than what was found
under my father's nails?

33:33.724 --> 33:36.145
- Was there anything else?
- Yeah, a couple other things,

33:36.182 --> 33:37.827
but they were all inconclusive.

33:37.970 --> 33:39.442
At the crime scene, I saw Forensics

33:39.479 --> 33:41.666
take a long hair off the bed.
They bagged it.

33:41.777 --> 33:44.369
You can't identify someone
from a single strand.

33:44.406 --> 33:46.625
No, but it can rule somebody out.

33:47.521 --> 33:49.904
I don't have access to Luna's
file, so...

33:49.941 --> 33:52.867
- this conversation is off the record.
- Of course.

33:55.590 --> 33:57.769
The hair is missing from evidence.

33:57.870 --> 33:59.629
I thought you'd wanna know.

34:00.946 --> 34:04.176
Owen, do you know who took Shane's
statement at the crime scene?

34:04.277 --> 34:06.775
He's now saying that
there's another suspect.

34:06.815 --> 34:08.088
I can find out.

34:08.259 --> 34:10.047
Let me take Shane back
to clarify his statement.

34:11.409 --> 34:12.952
I'll get him.

34:16.013 --> 34:17.784
Hey, Shane!

34:18.473 --> 34:20.043
Shane!

34:20.795 --> 34:22.590
Hey, Shane!

34:22.824 --> 34:24.538
Shane!

34:33.572 --> 34:34.877
Hey, Shane!

34:35.023 --> 34:36.406
Shane!

34:37.246 --> 34:39.273
Hey, stop, come on!

34:39.396 --> 34:41.371
Shane, stop!

34:41.786 --> 34:43.408
What are you doing?

34:43.768 --> 34:45.784
- Come on, we're giving a statement.
- No, man, I can't do it.

34:45.821 --> 34:47.630
I can't be talking to the cops.

34:47.668 --> 34:49.623
Are you in trouble for something?

34:50.839 --> 34:51.911
What'd you do?

34:51.947 --> 34:55.193
- You can't know.
- Tell me.

34:55.962 --> 34:57.841
Alright, then we're giving
your statement. Come on.

34:57.878 --> 35:01.948
No, stop!
I can't be talking to anybody, OK?

35:01.985 --> 35:03.870
They will find out,
they will come after me,

35:03.907 --> 35:06.104
and this time they're gonna
get the right room number, OK?

35:06.600 --> 35:08.046
Who?

35:08.255 --> 35:11.092
Shane, Joanna's innocent sister
is sitting in a detention center.

35:11.129 --> 35:12.766
- We're doing this now.
- Stop!

35:12.803 --> 35:14.712
You don't get it, man.

35:15.011 --> 35:17.042
I saw something I shouldn't have seen!

35:18.407 --> 35:21.579
At the motel? What did you see?

35:21.674 --> 35:23.422
Everyone has it wrong, dude.

35:23.523 --> 35:27.242
You know how I always stay in
room number 127? I asked for it,

35:27.353 --> 35:29.394
- and it was taken.
- OK...

35:29.495 --> 35:32.612
They got the wrong guy.
They were coming after me.

35:32.649 --> 35:33.819
Who's 'they'?

35:33.856 --> 35:35.541
Everyone thinks that the banker

35:35.578 --> 35:37.029
hung himself off the bridge,

35:37.066 --> 35:39.059
but they smothered him with
a pillow in his own bed.

35:39.147 --> 35:41.053
I saw them stage it,
set the whole thing up.

35:41.090 --> 35:42.222
That's why they want me dead.

35:42.259 --> 35:44.655
Shane, that's the plot of <i>The Godfather.</i>
You messing with me?

35:44.692 --> 35:46.144
Do you want proof?

35:46.200 --> 35:48.368
I can show you. Let's go.

35:51.958 --> 35:54.553
I can try and get access
to the initial lab results.

35:55.026 --> 35:56.796
Are you going to the station?

35:59.268 --> 36:01.102
He reeks of booze.

36:01.365 --> 36:03.315
I can't let that affect
the Crown's judgment.

36:03.434 --> 36:07.042
Yeah, of course.
Get him ready and prepped and sober

36:07.079 --> 36:09.206
and I'll set a meeting with
the Crown as soon as possible.

36:09.264 --> 36:11.499
Yeah, sounds good.

36:18.043 --> 36:19.615
<i>Thank you so much for meeting with me.</i>

36:19.733 --> 36:23.322
We have an eyewitness account of
another suspect leaving the scene

36:23.359 --> 36:25.033
between 9 and 10 P.M.

36:25.129 --> 36:26.943
So why didn't the cops question

36:26.980 --> 36:28.344
this witness if they were on the scene?

36:28.400 --> 36:31.427
They were questioned.
It was Shane Crawford.

36:32.725 --> 36:34.656
When a witness changes their story,

36:34.693 --> 36:37.049
especially weeks after the
incident, it's not reliable.

36:37.152 --> 36:39.188
His account of the
events hasn't changed...

36:39.225 --> 36:41.021
he just clarified what he meant.

36:41.227 --> 36:43.359
The police made an incorrect assumption

36:43.396 --> 36:46.358
that the woman that he
saw was Taylor Matheson.

36:46.913 --> 36:49.318
So you're saying we've had an eyewitness

36:49.355 --> 36:52.477
- of a different suspect from day one?
- Yes,

36:52.912 --> 36:54.646
while another young Indigenous woman

36:54.683 --> 36:56.985
remains in an overcrowded
detention center.

37:06.448 --> 37:08.099
Wait. Wait, wait.

37:18.704 --> 37:20.972
So, when David was killed

37:21.172 --> 37:23.731
and I realised the mix-up,
I was just gonna leave town,

37:23.768 --> 37:26.579
not tell anyone where I was headed.
Then I thought:

37:26.635 --> 37:30.051
if I stay, the motel is the
last place they would look now.

37:30.290 --> 37:31.877
I've been using the room as an office.

37:31.914 --> 37:33.882
Kinda like your home-work environment.

37:45.155 --> 37:47.032
After the murder, I traced it back.

37:48.060 --> 37:49.623
David Hanley wasn't the first one.

37:49.697 --> 37:51.528
It's been happening for months, man.

37:54.607 --> 37:57.543
I know, it's a lot to process.

37:57.885 --> 37:59.214
It's overwhelming.

37:59.251 --> 38:02.052
But I'll walk you through it,
man, every step of the way.

38:14.758 --> 38:15.889
See?

38:15.926 --> 38:18.230
Mark Johnson was a truck
driver, lives in Calgary.

38:18.443 --> 38:20.528
I hitched a ride with
another truck driver,

38:20.565 --> 38:22.733
same route that Mark would
take, bunch of times a year.

38:22.865 --> 38:25.066
And look, he's murdered.

38:25.270 --> 38:27.669
That's... that's crazy.

38:27.706 --> 38:30.545
I know, right? Now read this.

38:32.941 --> 38:35.497
This happens two weeks
after I leave Deveno.

38:35.880 --> 38:38.446
See? I mean, dude,
you didn't believe me,

38:38.483 --> 38:40.402
but once you see how it all connects...

38:42.320 --> 38:45.177
And to think, man, they almost got me.

38:45.376 --> 38:47.357
I asked the front desk that
night, I said:

38:47.394 --> 38:50.135
"Room number 127,
please." She said: 'sorry, occupied.'

38:50.172 --> 38:52.406
And then... David Hanley.

38:52.443 --> 38:54.187
- [PHONE RINGING]
- Don't answer it!

38:54.290 --> 38:55.416
Your phone should be off, man.

38:55.453 --> 38:57.403
If they know you know,
they'll come after you too.

38:57.440 --> 38:59.359
I just have a few more
pieces to figure out,

38:59.550 --> 39:01.402
then we're gonna take
all this to the cops.

39:01.439 --> 39:03.364
I knew the girl, Luna, was innocent.

39:03.436 --> 39:05.375
That's why I've been working so hard.
To get her off.

39:05.476 --> 39:07.243
We're gonna have to go
into witness protection.

39:07.344 --> 39:10.012
You rat out the mafia,
you don't keep the same name.

39:10.365 --> 39:11.865
No kidding.

39:12.960 --> 39:16.152
Billy, finally. I spoke with the Crown.

39:16.443 --> 39:19.239
Tim is on a call with the
Attorney General right now.

39:19.318 --> 39:21.409
Why would you approach the Crown
without talking to me first?

39:21.446 --> 39:22.719
What do you mean? This is good news.

39:22.756 --> 39:25.197
Tim wants to get Shane's
testimony as soon as possible.

39:25.284 --> 39:26.992
<i>When can you get him down
to the Crown's offices?</i>

39:27.072 --> 39:29.185
Joanna, you just screwed us.
Screwed Luna.

39:29.474 --> 39:32.457
Billy, this was the plan when you left.

39:33.991 --> 39:35.380
I don't understand what's wrong.

39:35.460 --> 39:37.940
You don't understand. Shane is...

39:38.885 --> 39:40.276
Shane's not well.

39:40.843 --> 39:42.612
OK.

39:43.168 --> 39:45.314
We will look into a rehab program.

39:45.553 --> 39:46.872
As soon as Shane testifies...

39:46.909 --> 39:49.210
Joanna, he is <i>not well.</i>

39:50.280 --> 39:52.719
He probably made the whole thing up.

39:53.129 --> 39:54.885
<i>I have to go.</i>

39:57.709 --> 39:59.680
I just talked to the Attorney General.

39:59.717 --> 40:02.067
I know. I am very sorry.

40:02.330 --> 40:05.319
You are. OK. Great.

40:05.356 --> 40:07.544
I'm gonna phone him back
and I'm just gonna tell him

40:07.581 --> 40:10.573
this was just a false lead.

40:12.026 --> 40:14.932
You're wasting the Court's time.
That's my time.

40:15.028 --> 40:17.874
That is a stunning lack
of professionalism,

40:17.911 --> 40:21.313
not to mention your arrogance to
think that you could possibly provide

40:21.503 --> 40:24.341
objective counsel to the
accused, to your sister.

40:24.378 --> 40:27.089
The witness will provide
a revised testimony.

40:28.663 --> 40:31.408
I should hope so. Thank you for that.

40:31.535 --> 40:33.996
And you will face the Ethics Committee

40:34.366 --> 40:36.247
as soon as the jury provides a ruling.

40:36.302 --> 40:38.967
And I'll tell you this,
tell you this for nothing...

40:39.190 --> 40:41.725
Your gross negligence will not sit well

40:41.762 --> 40:44.064
alongside a guilty verdict.

41:14.359 --> 41:16.034
Hi...

41:20.621 --> 41:22.901
I am sorry for not visiting.

41:25.641 --> 41:28.766
The first officer on the crime scene

41:28.803 --> 41:31.754
is required to testify
as a Crown witness.

41:33.405 --> 41:37.115
I knew seeing you would compromise
my ability to be objective.

41:37.928 --> 41:40.363
I see now that it was a mistake.

41:43.726 --> 41:45.468
Luna...

41:46.003 --> 41:47.776
I promise,

41:48.378 --> 41:51.814
I will do whatever I can
do to bring you home.

42:06.564 --> 42:08.301
I'm...

42:09.461 --> 42:12.428
I'm so, so sorry.

42:17.713 --> 42:19.702
I love you.

42:47.684 --> 42:49.918
Yeah, that guy goes there.

42:50.034 --> 42:52.669
Along with that guy right there.

43:00.444 --> 43:02.345
With your help,
it's gonna go so much faster.

43:02.525 --> 43:04.559
I was thinking maybe you could
write a summary or something.

43:04.771 --> 43:08.174
- Yeah. Yeah, I could do that.
- Awesome.

43:14.723 --> 43:17.755
<i>- Cerveza?
- No, I'm still working on this one.</i>

43:17.792 --> 43:19.693
You're really nursin' it, dude.

43:19.739 --> 43:22.198
I think somebody's
getting a little soft.

43:26.318 --> 43:27.791
Cheers.

43:28.610 --> 43:31.273
If I lap you again,
I get the Crawford Cup.
