01:13.680 --> 01:14.815
Miss?

01:15.782 --> 01:17.251
Excuse me.

01:17.918 --> 01:19.853
Wait. You alright?

01:21.689 --> 01:23.358
Can you hear me, miss?

01:29.730 --> 01:30.931
Uh...

01:36.002 --> 01:38.206
- Um...
- <i>You know where you are?</i>

01:39.639 --> 01:41.675
- <i>A-are you hurt in any way?</i>
- Uh...

01:43.644 --> 01:45.744
Was-was someone chasing you?
Do you...

01:45.746 --> 01:48.946
No, I'm sorry.
I'm... I'm alright.

01:48.948 --> 01:51.583
My name is Sarah Foster.

01:51.585 --> 01:54.422
I'm a student of the college.
I can give you my address.

01:57.591 --> 01:59.727
Would you like us
to give you a ride back?

02:00.995 --> 02:02.928
<i>Okay.</i>

02:26.553 --> 02:28.619
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

02:28.621 --> 02:30.622
They called. I said
that you were still in bed.

02:30.624 --> 02:31.990
No, I didn't lock
the door again.

02:31.992 --> 02:35.027
I know. It's crazy.
You're okay, though?

02:35.029 --> 02:37.396
Yeah, I'm fine.

02:37.398 --> 02:38.929
- Oh, you scared me.
- I'm sorry.

02:38.931 --> 02:41.401
I didn't think
it would happen again.

03:17.571 --> 03:19.070
Hello?

03:23.876 --> 03:25.976
You making coffee?

03:25.978 --> 03:28.512
I took the bus.

03:28.514 --> 03:30.385
Feet are still all wet.

03:35.589 --> 03:38.293
Oh, you said
you were gonna change this.

03:40.661 --> 03:42.830
This doesn't even look like me.

03:45.431 --> 03:47.665
I was thinking,
instead of going out for lunch

03:47.667 --> 03:50.034
we could get
something delivered.

03:50.036 --> 03:52.839
Just stay in, stay warm.

03:57.377 --> 03:58.812
Jonathan?

04:03.583 --> 04:05.416
<i>Just stop.</i>

04:05.418 --> 04:06.985
What's the matter?

04:06.987 --> 04:09.487
<i>I don't want you to see.</i>

04:09.489 --> 04:11.623
See what?

04:14.161 --> 04:16.527
- Jonathan, what are you doing?
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>

04:16.529 --> 04:17.796
- Jonathan...
- <i>I can't help it.</i>

04:17.798 --> 04:19.464
Jonathan, please, please.

04:19.466 --> 04:20.664
- Please, Jonathan! Jonathan!
- I can't help it.

04:54.868 --> 04:56.838
<i>Dr. Cooper,
your next patient is here.</i>

04:58.538 --> 05:00.839
Sarah Foster? I thought
I recognized the name.

05:00.841 --> 05:03.474
You were in a class of mine
when you were an undergraduate.

05:03.476 --> 05:05.109
- Do you remember?
- Of course I do.

05:05.111 --> 05:06.611
I remember.

05:06.613 --> 05:08.046
I read the form you filled out

05:08.048 --> 05:11.450
and the university
still had your file.

05:11.452 --> 05:13.851
And of course, I've seen
what happened in the papers.

05:13.853 --> 05:16.488
- <i>I'm very sorry for you.</i>
- Thank you.

05:16.490 --> 05:19.491
But the form gave a different
reason for you coming in.

05:19.493 --> 05:23.762
Yes, I'll always be coping
with his suicide.

05:23.764 --> 05:27.132
But I saw a doctor for a year,
and I decided

05:27.134 --> 05:31.068
to come back to school
and finish my dissertation.

05:31.070 --> 05:33.572
To try to get back
to where I was before.

05:33.574 --> 05:37.642
But since I've been back,
I've been walking in my sleep.

05:37.644 --> 05:39.777
<i>At first,
it was just around my apartment</i>

05:39.779 --> 05:41.680
but a few days ago,
the police found me

05:41.682 --> 05:43.714
and I had walked
almost three miles.

05:43.716 --> 05:45.750
Wasn't your door locked?

05:45.752 --> 05:47.585
I unlocked it in my sleep.

05:47.587 --> 05:49.923
Did you ever sleepwalk
before coming back to school?

05:51.257 --> 05:53.892
How is your sleep
apart from that?

05:53.894 --> 05:56.727
Not good.
I have trouble falling asleep.

05:56.729 --> 05:58.096
And I have nightmares.

05:58.098 --> 06:00.664
Can you tell me about them?

06:00.666 --> 06:02.734
Usually, there's a man.

06:02.736 --> 06:05.202
I can't see him,
but I know he wants to hurt me

06:05.204 --> 06:06.938
and I can't get away.

06:06.940 --> 06:10.075
Sometimes I can't move or
even get any air when I breathe.

06:10.077 --> 06:11.943
Do the same dreams repeat?

06:11.945 --> 06:14.613
Well, it's always the same man.

06:14.615 --> 06:16.882
I don't know who he is
or who he would be.

06:16.884 --> 06:19.683
- How are your moods?
- Sad.

06:19.685 --> 06:21.685
Lonely.

06:21.687 --> 06:23.154
But I'm working at it.

06:23.156 --> 06:25.524
At moving forward.

06:25.526 --> 06:27.625
Grief can be overwhelming.

06:27.627 --> 06:29.027
And it certainly
is a factor in what

06:29.029 --> 06:31.195
you're going through right now.

06:31.197 --> 06:35.036
But your sleep disorder
could be purely a medical issue.

06:41.108 --> 06:44.109
I'd like to schedule
a check-up for you

06:44.111 --> 06:46.044
and also introduce you
to some people that I think

06:46.046 --> 06:48.046
can help you here
at the university.

06:48.048 --> 06:50.250
- Is that alright?
- Of course.

06:51.885 --> 06:54.118
You're going to keep
getting better, Sarah.

06:54.120 --> 06:56.253
I believe that, and there are
certainly going to be

06:56.255 --> 06:58.323
some tough patches,
but you're facing

06:58.325 --> 07:00.325
your new life very bravely.

07:00.327 --> 07:02.626
I want you to come and see me

07:02.628 --> 07:05.830
at any time,
for any reason at all.

07:05.832 --> 07:06.933
Okay?

07:07.767 --> 07:09.568
Thank you.

07:09.570 --> 07:12.873
And maybe find a way to put
a second lock on that door.

07:15.075 --> 07:16.176
Okay.

07:24.784 --> 07:27.251
I'm going to the sleep
research center tonight.

07:27.253 --> 07:29.286
To sleep?

07:29.288 --> 07:31.289
- That'll be weird.
- Mm-hmm.

07:31.291 --> 07:34.258
Oh, hey,
do you remember Neal Owens?

07:34.260 --> 07:36.594
I finally sent him
a text message.

07:36.596 --> 07:39.296
I was gonna have you read it
before, but then I just didn't.

07:39.298 --> 07:41.099
Hmm.

07:41.101 --> 07:43.068
I figured if you want something,
you got to put the idea

07:43.070 --> 07:44.803
out there, so I did.

07:44.805 --> 07:46.607
I thought he was your professor.

07:47.908 --> 07:49.673
Technically, he's my professor

07:49.675 --> 07:51.241
but I mean, I just figured
if everything works out

07:51.243 --> 07:53.945
I could just drop
the class, right?

07:53.947 --> 07:55.779
I thought about sending him
a picture.

07:55.781 --> 07:57.748
Oh, don't do that.

07:57.750 --> 08:00.051
Leave something
for his imagination.

08:00.053 --> 08:02.387
You haven't gone out
with anybody since I've met you.

08:02.389 --> 08:03.988
No one's asked.

08:03.990 --> 08:06.090
You know, I read somewhere
that every day

08:06.092 --> 08:08.760
you should identify
three potential soulmates

08:08.762 --> 08:11.161
and then you visualize
all these details about them

08:11.163 --> 08:13.099
and then you bring them
to life in your mind.

08:27.014 --> 08:28.813
Okay, see him?

08:28.815 --> 08:31.282
If he asked me out...

08:31.284 --> 08:32.686
A funeral?

08:33.852 --> 08:35.756
It's a little dark,
but which one?

08:37.323 --> 08:39.594
<i>That one,
getting out of the car.</i>

08:41.695 --> 08:44.428
<i>He looks a little married.</i>

08:44.430 --> 08:46.733
Oh, I'm imagining him single.

08:48.669 --> 08:50.300
That's good. That's right.

08:50.302 --> 08:52.606
First step is to think about it.

09:15.862 --> 09:18.228
<i>So your blood work
came back fine</i>

09:18.230 --> 09:19.997
<i>but that doesn't
rule out everything.</i>

09:19.999 --> 09:23.101
<i>The dream where you reported
a sense of suffocation</i>

09:23.103 --> 09:25.002
that can be a sign
of sleep apnea.

09:25.004 --> 09:27.404
It's a disorder where you stop
breathing while you're asleep.

09:27.406 --> 09:29.039
Isn't that dangerous?

09:29.041 --> 09:30.308
We'll know by tomorrow morning
if you have it

09:30.310 --> 09:32.077
and then we can treat it.

09:32.079 --> 09:34.879
<i>What we'd like to do is have
you stay here for a few nights</i>

09:34.881 --> 09:37.749
<i>so we can build a profile
of your sleep life.</i>

09:37.751 --> 09:41.218
This machine here monitors all
your vitals, your respiration

09:41.220 --> 09:43.722
your heart rate, EEG,
readout of everything

09:43.724 --> 09:45.390
that's going on
inside your head.

09:45.392 --> 09:46.957
My dreams?

09:46.959 --> 09:49.059
Not exactly,
just your neural activity.

09:49.061 --> 09:51.862
Uh... but we will know when
you're dreaming and exactly

09:51.864 --> 09:54.164
what's going on inside your head
before you dream.

09:54.166 --> 09:55.866
And what if I walk in my sleep?

09:55.868 --> 09:57.401
Uh, there's a break-away cable
right there.

09:57.403 --> 09:59.904
We'll also have someone watching
you throughout the night.

09:59.906 --> 10:01.438
That way, you don't go anywhere.

10:01.440 --> 10:04.775
- So I can't leave.
- Of course you can.

10:04.777 --> 10:06.877
<i>But only when you're awake.</i>

10:06.879 --> 10:09.380
<i>Sarah, uh, this is Dr. White.</i>

10:09.382 --> 10:11.116
<i>He's the, uh,
director of this center.</i>

10:11.118 --> 10:12.917
Sarah Foster.

10:12.919 --> 10:14.385
Hi.

10:14.387 --> 10:16.353
Could you come see me
when you're finished here?

10:16.355 --> 10:17.825
Hm.

10:22.963 --> 10:24.496
I'll leave you to it.
I'll be right back.

10:24.498 --> 10:25.965
Thank you.

10:41.948 --> 10:43.213
Oh, excuse me.

10:43.215 --> 10:44.484
<i>Excuse me.</i>

10:48.155 --> 10:50.255
Did you need Dr. Koslov?

10:50.257 --> 10:53.493
I tried, and I don't think
it's working.

10:56.496 --> 10:57.965
Well, it's faulty.

10:59.031 --> 11:01.031
What did you need?

11:01.033 --> 11:04.169
I just don't think I'm gonna be
able to fall asleep in here.

11:04.171 --> 11:05.904
Well, that's normal.

11:05.906 --> 11:08.108
I did not sleep
last night anyways.

11:12.411 --> 11:14.578
I know that I know you.

11:14.580 --> 11:16.382
I don't think so.

11:18.450 --> 11:20.418
Oh, at the funeral.

11:20.420 --> 11:22.055
<i>I saw you at the funeral.</i>

11:23.455 --> 11:25.189
- Were you there?
- Yeah.

11:25.191 --> 11:28.860
Well, I-I was nearby,
walking to the cemetery.

11:28.862 --> 11:30.127
<i>Who was it?</i>

11:30.129 --> 11:32.462
It was a young woman.

11:32.464 --> 11:34.966
She was a student
here at the school.

11:34.968 --> 11:36.500
<i>Sorry.</i>

11:36.502 --> 11:39.037
<i>I saw you in the car
with your wife.</i>

11:39.039 --> 11:41.840
Oh, that's another doctor here.
I'm not married.

11:41.842 --> 11:44.241
Oh, me neither.
I mean, I was but...

11:44.243 --> 11:45.879
<i>To the writer?</i>

11:46.378 --> 11:48.478
Yeah.

11:48.480 --> 11:51.582
Oh, that must
have been interesting.

11:51.584 --> 11:55.022
You know, loving him
didn't mean loving his writing.

11:56.189 --> 11:57.487
<i>I shouldn't say that.</i>

11:57.489 --> 12:00.924
I mean,
I knew his books were good.

12:00.926 --> 12:04.062
Great even,
it's what I studied, but...

12:04.064 --> 12:05.362
...sometimes
I would read his stuff

12:05.364 --> 12:08.232
<i>and just not connect with it.</i>

12:08.234 --> 12:09.903
Not like I did with him.

12:11.537 --> 12:13.270
He'll never know I said that.

12:13.272 --> 12:16.540
I'll have Dr. Koslov
bring up one of these.

12:16.542 --> 12:18.342
Okay.

12:18.344 --> 12:20.815
- Sleep well.
- Thank you.

13:16.169 --> 13:18.068
<i>Good morning, Sarah.</i>

13:18.070 --> 13:19.169
<i>Hopefully,
you weren't too alarmed</i>

13:19.171 --> 13:20.538
<i>we moved you last night.</i>

13:20.540 --> 13:22.340
There's better monitoring
equipment here.

13:22.342 --> 13:25.009
- It's nicer.
- Okay.

13:25.011 --> 13:27.010
How do you feel?

13:27.012 --> 13:31.082
I slept the whole night.
I haven't done that in months.

13:31.084 --> 13:32.549
Did I do anything strange?

13:32.551 --> 13:35.153
Uh, no, you slept quietly.

13:35.155 --> 13:37.722
I don't think I had any dreams.

13:37.724 --> 13:40.158
Uh, that's pretty normal
for the first night.

13:40.160 --> 13:44.028
Can't believe you moved me
and I didn't wake up.

13:44.030 --> 13:46.530
Uh, good news, Dr. White here is
gonna stay personally involved

13:46.532 --> 13:48.332
in your case,
uh, which is a-a big deal.

13:48.334 --> 13:50.400
Good. Okay. Great.

13:50.402 --> 13:52.102
Sarah, what we learned
last night

13:52.104 --> 13:55.673
is that you have
fairly unusual neural patterns.

13:55.675 --> 13:57.207
It's not anything
to be concerned about

13:57.209 --> 13:58.241
from a health perspective.

13:58.243 --> 14:00.111
Your thetas are very unique.

14:00.113 --> 14:01.645
<i>What we see here normally is
the same thing over and over.</i>

14:01.647 --> 14:03.180
<i>But your brain waves...</i>

14:03.182 --> 14:04.682
Could that be causing
my sleep walking?

14:04.684 --> 14:07.617
<i>It's possible but not likely.</i>

14:07.619 --> 14:10.087
<i>We'll find out.</i>

14:10.089 --> 14:12.457
Right now, we're just building
a basic profile.

14:12.459 --> 14:14.092
<i>What we'd like to do
is have you stay here at least</i>

14:14.094 --> 14:16.461
<i>three nights this week,
if possible.</i>

14:16.463 --> 14:19.266
Oh, I'll stay here every night
if I sleep this well.

14:20.200 --> 14:21.468
Good.

14:37.117 --> 14:39.116
Hey. How was it?

14:39.118 --> 14:41.486
It was good. I slept.

14:41.488 --> 14:43.321
God, how nice that is!

14:43.323 --> 14:45.490
I go back tomorrow.

14:45.492 --> 14:47.692
Hey, do you remember that man
we saw at the funeral?

14:47.694 --> 14:49.260
<i>The one in the car.</i>

14:49.262 --> 14:51.462
I met him.
He's the director at the center.

14:51.464 --> 14:54.631
Look at you, home-wrecker.

14:54.633 --> 14:57.235
It wasn't his wife driving.
It was another doctor.

14:57.237 --> 14:59.039
Oh, that's boring.

15:00.773 --> 15:03.074
He's nice.

15:03.443 --> 15:06.276
- Is that your professor?
- No.

15:06.278 --> 15:07.745
Haven't heard from him.

15:07.747 --> 15:10.615
I'm starting to think
I'm done with that whole thing.

15:10.617 --> 15:13.217
I should have sent him
those pictures.

15:13.219 --> 15:14.655
See ya.

15:19.691 --> 15:21.659
<i>The prince's brain
was-was addicted</i>

15:21.661 --> 15:23.126
to the dopamine release
that came

15:23.128 --> 15:25.163
from thinking about her.

15:25.165 --> 15:28.298
Love's inevitable drop
in serotonin level meant

15:28.300 --> 15:32.403
he was gonna grow
more and more obsessed.

15:32.405 --> 15:34.672
'Cause let's face it,
ladies and gentlemen

15:34.674 --> 15:36.673
chemically, love is just

15:36.675 --> 15:39.242
a type of a bipolar disorder.

15:39.244 --> 15:41.312
It can lead to heroism
or homicide

15:41.314 --> 15:43.081
and even happily ever after

15:43.083 --> 15:45.149
but for our prince

15:45.151 --> 15:47.421
<i>the script was over
before their first kiss.</i>

15:49.289 --> 15:51.225
You don't buy it, do you?

15:52.624 --> 15:56.226
- That there's no free will?
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

15:56.228 --> 15:58.829
I see the science,
but... there's more to love

15:58.831 --> 16:01.466
than chasing a dopamine high.

16:01.468 --> 16:03.467
<i>What he did was beautiful.</i>

16:03.469 --> 16:07.204
Okay, but-but look at
his mental states in the story.

16:07.206 --> 16:10.341
Sleeplessness, elation,
loss of appetite

16:10.343 --> 16:14.745
<i>devotion, obsession,
disconnection, grief, rage.</i>

16:14.747 --> 16:17.247
Am I the only one
who thinks the origin

16:17.249 --> 16:20.550
for some of the most
exhilarating, romantic

16:20.552 --> 16:25.523
love stories might be...
chemical imbalance.

16:25.525 --> 16:27.357
Okay, by a show of hands.

16:27.359 --> 16:29.228
Who sides with Miss Wells?

16:30.897 --> 16:32.199
What?

16:33.833 --> 16:36.199
Are we on the same side?

16:36.201 --> 16:37.400
Foster.

16:37.402 --> 16:38.568
<i>Beg your pardon?</i>

16:38.570 --> 16:40.541
You said Wells, it's Foster.

16:41.807 --> 16:43.676
I'm afraid I don't follow.

16:45.277 --> 16:48.346
My name is Sarah Foster,
not Wells.

16:48.348 --> 16:50.213
<i>Sarah Foster.</i>

16:50.215 --> 16:52.485
If that's how you'd like it
to be, sure.

16:54.921 --> 16:56.888
Is he making
some kind of a joke?

16:56.890 --> 16:59.259
Your name is Sarah Wells.

17:07.700 --> 17:10.935
Hey, what's my last name?

17:10.936 --> 17:12.637
What?

17:12.638 --> 17:15.573
Wells. The last time I checked.

17:15.575 --> 17:17.307
Did you think I didn't know
your last name?

18:30.283 --> 18:31.916
Dr. Cooper left at 5:00.

18:31.918 --> 18:33.484
I sent a message to her phone

18:33.486 --> 18:35.820
but she'll definitely
be back in the morning.

18:35.822 --> 18:38.522
This is kind of important.
Did you give her my number?

18:38.524 --> 18:40.390
I did.

18:40.392 --> 18:42.828
Is there anything else
I can do for you, Miss Wells?

18:55.642 --> 18:56.910
<i>Sarah.</i>

18:58.411 --> 19:00.747
Uh, he's not gonna be in
until later.

19:02.047 --> 19:04.015
<i>He and I
are both your doctors.</i>

19:04.017 --> 19:06.883
<i>If you wanna tell me
what's happening...</i>

19:06.885 --> 19:08.821
I'd rather wait for Dr. White.

19:14.994 --> 19:17.995
Let me ask you something.

19:17.997 --> 19:20.497
One of our staff, uh,
found this in the hallway

19:20.499 --> 19:23.333
outside the room
we moved you to last night.

19:23.335 --> 19:25.703
<i>When a patient has a dream
that we deem to be significant</i>

19:25.705 --> 19:27.737
we fill out one of these forms.

19:27.739 --> 19:29.739
<i>This one has your name on it.</i>

19:29.741 --> 19:32.008
I didn't have any dreams.

19:32.010 --> 19:34.644
That's what I thought too, but...

19:34.646 --> 19:36.813
...you described
being chased by a woman.

19:36.815 --> 19:38.381
<i>Someone who hurt you.</i>

19:38.383 --> 19:40.751
That's not my dream.

19:40.753 --> 19:42.453
You sure?

19:42.455 --> 19:45.488
Yeah, and it's not
my handwriting.

19:45.490 --> 19:46.926
Yeah, look.

19:51.698 --> 19:52.833
Wait.

20:42.648 --> 20:44.084
Good morning.

20:46.651 --> 20:48.686
We came to see you last night

20:48.688 --> 20:50.019
but you were already sleeping.

20:50.021 --> 20:53.056
Dr. Koslov said you wanted
to ask me something.

20:53.058 --> 20:54.624
Nothing.

20:54.626 --> 20:56.861
I-I feel better.
I was just anxious.

20:56.863 --> 20:58.696
About?

20:58.698 --> 21:00.898
Nothing. There's nothing.

21:00.900 --> 21:03.767
Okay. No dreams last night?

21:03.769 --> 21:04.901
Not that I remember.

21:04.903 --> 21:07.170
That's what the machine
told us too.

21:07.172 --> 21:10.109
And you're coming to see us
again the day after tomorrow.

21:11.177 --> 21:12.679
Hmm.

21:47.613 --> 21:49.179
Excuse me.

21:49.181 --> 21:50.816
Do you work here?

21:51.717 --> 21:53.684
I do.

21:53.686 --> 21:56.454
Can I ask, are there
any types of amnesia

21:56.456 --> 21:58.859
where a person might forget
only one single thing.

22:00.692 --> 22:04.495
Are you, uh, working on a...
working on a class study?

22:04.497 --> 22:07.031
If a patient forgot their name
but nothing else.

22:07.033 --> 22:10.100
What if everything else
was normal?

22:10.102 --> 22:12.236
- Partial retrograde amnesia.
- <i>Right.</i>

22:12.238 --> 22:14.905
<i>Is that curable?</i>

22:14.907 --> 22:17.675
It can be permanent but...

22:17.677 --> 22:19.109
...in a vast majority of cases

22:19.111 --> 22:21.245
it-it goes away on its own.

22:21.247 --> 22:24.849
It can be induced
by a traumatic event

22:24.851 --> 22:28.017
uh, brain injury
or even disrupted sleep.

22:28.019 --> 22:31.088
It usually just takes care
of itself, though?

22:31.090 --> 22:33.090
Almost always.

22:33.092 --> 22:36.226
Now the clinical protocol
is to get the patient back

22:36.228 --> 22:38.532
into the routine
of their old lives.

22:39.498 --> 22:41.832
Really, that's it?

22:41.834 --> 22:45.201
That's everything
that's happening.

22:45.203 --> 22:47.137
If the memory lapses

22:47.139 --> 22:49.939
ever become
full-blown hallucinations

22:49.941 --> 22:53.544
then you're into
psychosis territory.

22:53.546 --> 22:57.984
I'd... be happy to explain
over a-a cup of coffee.

23:00.052 --> 23:01.721
No thanks.

23:44.863 --> 23:46.663
<i>Hey, how'd it go?</i>

23:46.665 --> 23:49.033
Went well. Hi.

23:49.035 --> 23:51.634
Is Dawn in her room?

23:51.636 --> 23:53.336
- Who?
- Dawn.

23:53.338 --> 23:55.205
Are you a friend of hers?

23:55.207 --> 23:57.341
<i>Who's Dawn?</i>

23:57.343 --> 24:00.244
- Did it happen again?
- <i>Did what happen again?</i>

24:00.246 --> 24:01.678
The sleep-walking thing.

24:01.680 --> 24:03.647
You know about my sleep-walking?

24:03.649 --> 24:04.751
Yeah.

24:07.286 --> 24:09.820
You live here?

24:09.822 --> 24:11.589
Yup.

24:11.591 --> 24:14.624
Since the beginning
of the school year?

24:14.626 --> 24:17.093
Are you...
mad at me or something?

24:17.095 --> 24:19.228
'Cause I have lab
in, like, ten minutes and I...

24:19.230 --> 24:21.966
No, not at all. It's just that...

24:21.968 --> 24:24.200
Can you tell me your name?

24:24.202 --> 24:25.872
Why are you being so weird?

24:26.805 --> 24:28.339
Sorry, it's just...

24:28.341 --> 24:30.040
What is it?

24:30.042 --> 24:31.678
Nichole Wyatt.

24:32.711 --> 24:34.711
Do I need to worry about you?

24:34.713 --> 24:36.045
No. No, I just...

24:36.047 --> 24:37.851
I had a weird night and...

24:40.151 --> 24:41.688
Yeah.

25:02.874 --> 25:04.108
Hello?

25:04.110 --> 25:06.075
<i>Sarah.</i>

25:06.077 --> 25:08.978
- Who's this?
- <i>Sarah.</i>

25:08.980 --> 25:11.415
- <i>You know who I am.</i>
- What?

25:11.417 --> 25:14.721
<i>You're all
I can think about, Sarah.</i>

25:16.122 --> 25:17.388
Who is this?

25:17.390 --> 25:20.326
<i>I'm the one out here
in the dark.</i>

25:32.837 --> 25:36.108
<i>No one has ever touched you
like I do.</i>

25:37.942 --> 25:40.046
<i>Do you like it
when I watch you?</i>

25:41.747 --> 25:43.682
<i>When I'm close.</i>

25:55.393 --> 25:56.863
Excuse me.

25:57.863 --> 25:59.329
I'm sorry.

25:59.331 --> 26:00.930
I'm Elaine Cooper.

26:00.932 --> 26:02.800
I can see you in just a moment.

26:02.802 --> 26:05.201
- Dr. Cooper.
- Yes?

26:05.203 --> 26:07.137
It's Sarah.

26:07.139 --> 26:09.005
I'm sorry, I just got here,
but I'll be able

26:09.007 --> 26:10.977
to see you
in just a moment.

26:13.144 --> 26:15.379
We spoke to each other
few days ago.

26:15.381 --> 26:18.181
- On the phone?
- No, I'm Sarah.

26:18.183 --> 26:19.382
Sarah...

26:19.384 --> 26:21.951
I couldn't find a file for her.

26:21.953 --> 26:23.419
I came in to see you.

26:23.421 --> 26:25.456
You remembered me
from when I was a student here.

26:25.458 --> 26:28.492
- We talked about my husband.
- Three days ago?

26:28.494 --> 26:30.130
S-Sarah Foster.

26:31.430 --> 26:34.331
- Sarah Wells.
- I checked both names.

26:34.333 --> 26:36.300
My husband was Jonathan Grey.

26:36.302 --> 26:38.034
The author.

26:38.036 --> 26:40.070
Is that so?

26:40.072 --> 26:42.371
- You don't remember?
- No.

26:42.373 --> 26:45.976
Um, sorry, it happens. I'm not
as young as I used to be.

26:45.978 --> 26:48.178
Were you at the hospital
at all?

26:48.180 --> 26:50.980
- What?
- At the Weiss clinic.

26:50.982 --> 26:53.419
No. I don't know what that is.

26:57.422 --> 27:00.858
Okay. Um, I wanna talk to you.

27:00.860 --> 27:02.926
But first we're gonna
have to locate your records.

27:02.928 --> 27:06.028
Are there any other names
you could be listed under?

27:06.030 --> 27:07.430
I-I'm gonna come back. Okay?

27:07.432 --> 27:09.432
- I'd rather you stay.
- I'm gonna come back.

27:09.434 --> 27:11.200
Don't worry,
I think I made a mistake.

27:11.202 --> 27:14.239
Are you sure? Can I call someone
to come and pick you up?

27:51.142 --> 27:54.076
<i>Did you forget something?</i>

27:54.078 --> 27:57.214
No. I'm not sleeping
at the center tonight.

27:57.216 --> 27:59.248
- <i>Everything okay?</i>
- It's fine.

27:59.250 --> 28:00.819
<i>I'll go back tomorrow.</i>

28:35.054 --> 28:36.989
My name is Sarah Foster.

31:31.596 --> 31:33.598
Thank you.

32:55.314 --> 32:57.880
<i>Don't worry, Sarah.</i>

32:57.882 --> 33:01.118
<i>I'm always watching you.</i>

33:01.120 --> 33:03.519
<i>I feel
like you're waiting for me.</i>

33:03.521 --> 33:05.724
<i>Do you know
I came to see you last night?</i>

33:06.691 --> 33:08.824
<i>Feeling you, Sarah.</i>

33:08.826 --> 33:11.631
<i>Your bones under your skin.</i>

33:13.699 --> 33:16.635
<i>Could you feel my fingers
moving over you?</i>

34:45.656 --> 34:47.290
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:47.292 --> 34:49.395
Did you go back
to the place last night?

34:50.529 --> 34:52.629
Yeah. I did. Um...

34:52.630 --> 34:54.931
Hey, can you let me in?
I forgot my keys.

34:54.933 --> 34:56.168
Yeah.

34:57.335 --> 34:58.768
Where-where-where are you going?

34:58.770 --> 35:00.937
To meet Neal for coffee.

35:00.939 --> 35:02.871
Is that your professor?

35:02.873 --> 35:03.906
Duh.

35:03.908 --> 35:06.211
I sent him a bunch of pictures.

35:07.379 --> 35:09.181
- <i>See ya.</i>
- Bye.

36:31.730 --> 36:32.998
Dr. White?

36:34.732 --> 36:36.001
Scott?

36:37.669 --> 36:39.636
<i>Scott!</i>

36:39.638 --> 36:40.937
Sarah?

36:40.939 --> 36:43.073
<i>Sorry, your address
was in the directory.</i>

36:43.075 --> 36:45.908
<i>I didn't know
where else to go.</i>

36:45.910 --> 36:47.476
I probably
shouldn't have come, I'm...

36:47.478 --> 36:49.011
<i>No, no, it's fine.</i>

36:49.013 --> 36:50.048
<i>Come on.</i>

36:52.683 --> 36:54.319
What's going on?

36:57.689 --> 37:00.390
I forgot my last name...

37:00.392 --> 37:03.092
...or I remembered it wrong.

37:03.094 --> 37:04.594
It didn't use to be Wells.

37:04.596 --> 37:07.830
- It was Foster.
- Foster?

37:07.832 --> 37:10.400
You knew me as Sarah Foster.

37:10.402 --> 37:11.734
But if I asked you right now,
you'd say

37:11.736 --> 37:14.404
that you've never heard
that name, right?

37:14.406 --> 37:16.940
And then I guess I remembered
my roommate wrong.

37:16.942 --> 37:19.442
I had been living
with this girl Dawn.

37:19.444 --> 37:21.578
And then it was
this girl Nichole

37:21.580 --> 37:23.645
but... they're different people.

37:23.647 --> 37:25.848
And... who's there now?

37:25.850 --> 37:27.619
Dawn. She's back.

37:29.087 --> 37:30.987
I went to see Dr. Cooper,
and she didn't remember me

37:30.989 --> 37:34.022
even though I had just seen her
a couple of days ago.

37:34.024 --> 37:35.960
She had no idea.

37:37.728 --> 37:40.397
I was hoping you had
some sort of explanation.

37:40.399 --> 37:42.500
Maybe, you've seen this before?

37:51.009 --> 37:54.176
Hi, Elaine, it's Scott White.

37:54.178 --> 37:57.080
Hey. Listen, I'm talking
with Sarah Wells right now

37:57.082 --> 37:58.882
and we think
it might be a good idea

37:58.884 --> 38:01.717
for her to come
and talk to you on Monday.

38:01.719 --> 38:03.486
Uh-huh.

38:03.488 --> 38:05.422
But right now, I just wanted
to have her say hello to you.

38:05.424 --> 38:07.757
Is that okay?

38:07.759 --> 38:09.027
Say hello.

38:10.928 --> 38:12.564
Dr. Cooper?

38:14.933 --> 38:18.835
Yeah, I'm feeling okay.

38:18.837 --> 38:19.805
Okay.

38:22.573 --> 38:24.007
Okay.

38:24.009 --> 38:26.875
Yeah, I'll have her call
your office to set up a time.

38:26.877 --> 38:28.980
Great. Sure, sure.

38:32.451 --> 38:34.551
- She remembers you.
- She didn't yesterday.

38:34.553 --> 38:36.087
I stood right there
in her office.

38:37.022 --> 38:40.489
I'm not a psychiatrist.

38:40.491 --> 38:45.127
Sarah... you have
unusual sleep patterns.

38:45.129 --> 38:47.563
Is that why this is happening?

38:47.565 --> 38:48.931
I don't know.

38:48.933 --> 38:51.801
It's possible something
in your condition

38:51.803 --> 38:53.136
could be altering
your perception

38:53.138 --> 38:54.471
of what's happening
in your life.

38:54.473 --> 38:56.473
Well, what if it's not
my perception?

38:56.475 --> 38:58.775
The world doesn't change
in that way.

38:58.777 --> 39:00.713
Well, what if it does?

39:02.547 --> 39:04.047
I made a mistake
coming back to school.

39:04.049 --> 39:06.583
I'm sorry, I... I'm gonna go.

39:06.585 --> 39:08.988
- Sarah.
- Sorry, I bothered you.

39:53.564 --> 39:55.130
Sarah.

39:55.132 --> 39:58.837
<i>Sarah! Sarah! Sarah!</i>

39:59.870 --> 40:01.073
Sarah.

40:01.906 --> 40:03.672
Are you alright?

40:03.674 --> 40:05.275
He was waiting in my apartment.

40:05.277 --> 40:07.277
He saw me, he chased me.
I don't know.

40:07.279 --> 40:09.712
He's been leaving me messages,
and he wants to hurt me.

40:09.714 --> 40:11.580
- We have to go to the police.
- No, I don't want to.

40:11.582 --> 40:13.815
You say he came after you.
You have to go to the police.

40:13.817 --> 40:15.551
- I wanna go home.
- Sarah, come on. Calm down.

40:15.553 --> 40:16.988
I don't wanna be here anymore.

40:17.989 --> 40:19.755
Get in.

40:20.792 --> 40:22.228
Okay.

40:27.232 --> 40:28.634
In here.

40:30.868 --> 40:32.768
It's probably someone
you met for a moment.

40:32.770 --> 40:34.038
A few minutes.

40:36.274 --> 40:38.975
That's just it,
it doesn't feel like...

40:38.977 --> 40:40.743
...he's a stranger.

40:40.745 --> 40:42.578
Feels like the man in my dreams.

40:42.580 --> 40:44.849
I think it'll come to you.

40:46.216 --> 40:47.685
Ow!

40:49.821 --> 40:51.757
I got something for that.

40:59.263 --> 41:00.929
Let me see.

41:00.931 --> 41:03.833
I'm afraid to go back to sleep.

41:03.835 --> 41:06.772
- What if things change again?
- Nothing's gonna change.

41:08.939 --> 41:10.306
If you have another one
of these dreams...

41:10.308 --> 41:11.873
They're not dreams.

41:11.875 --> 41:14.546
I'm still having bad dreams.
I had one last night.

41:16.013 --> 41:17.647
But when I woke up
in that bedroom

41:17.649 --> 41:20.118
and it wasn't my room,
I was awake.

41:24.189 --> 41:25.824
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

41:27.192 --> 41:28.694
Thank you.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.333
I can't tell you
that I understand

41:37.335 --> 41:38.701
what's happening to you

41:38.703 --> 41:40.902
but I do know about dreams.

41:40.904 --> 41:43.739
We think of them as stories,
but really they're emotions.

41:43.741 --> 41:46.308
There's a... chemical trigger.

41:46.310 --> 41:48.944
When we sleep,
the brain releases chemicals

41:48.946 --> 41:52.348
and we experience
a rush of emotion.

41:52.350 --> 41:53.982
<i>And then the thinking part
of our brain</i>

41:53.984 --> 41:56.321
<i>tells us a story
to explain those feelings.</i>

41:58.089 --> 42:00.323
That house wasn't a dream.

42:00.325 --> 42:03.393
W-what if we treat it
like it was?

42:03.395 --> 42:05.661
Tell me what you were feeling.

42:05.663 --> 42:07.600
I was afraid
someone would find me.

42:09.200 --> 42:10.933
Who?

42:10.935 --> 42:12.705
The woman who lived there.

42:13.772 --> 42:16.040
I saw her dress on a chair.

42:18.109 --> 42:19.377
And?

42:20.678 --> 42:22.780
And I wanted to get out.

42:24.448 --> 42:28.820
But... I also wanted her to know
that I was there.

42:30.020 --> 42:32.254
I was angry at her.

42:32.256 --> 42:34.392
I wanted her to be scared of me.

42:36.160 --> 42:38.928
But I don't,
I don't know who she is.

42:38.930 --> 42:41.734
I don't... want anything
to do with her.

42:43.701 --> 42:45.404
I'm gonna have you
sleep here tonight.

42:47.071 --> 42:49.340
Things might look different
in the morning.

42:55.180 --> 42:57.281
I'll just be
right across the hall.

43:05.957 --> 43:07.957
There's a storm.

43:07.959 --> 43:09.826
<i>I see 'em coming down
from the mountains.</i>

43:09.828 --> 43:11.761
It's beautiful.

43:14.431 --> 43:17.902
If my mind is broken,
can anything make me better?

43:22.306 --> 43:24.243
Why are you helping me?

43:26.076 --> 43:29.881
I don't know why... but I am.

43:31.049 --> 43:32.685
I will help you.

43:33.350 --> 43:35.851
I know that.

43:35.853 --> 43:38.987
We're going to get through
to the other side of this.

43:38.989 --> 43:40.926
This is all gonna make sense.

43:57.975 --> 43:59.243
<i>Goodnight.</i>

44:00.044 --> 44:01.312
Goodnight.

44:55.098 --> 44:57.900
Go away. Go away. Go away.

44:57.902 --> 44:59.304
Go away! Get out of here!

45:05.442 --> 45:06.911
Scott?

45:57.127 --> 45:58.396
Scott?

45:59.663 --> 46:01.132
Scott?

47:07.332 --> 47:10.299
Oh, hi. Is Dr. White here?

47:10.301 --> 47:11.634
Uh, yeah.

47:11.636 --> 47:13.435
Can I say who's here to see him?

47:13.437 --> 47:15.404
Sarah Foster.

47:15.406 --> 47:17.342
I'm sorry. Sarah Wells.

47:19.210 --> 47:20.312
One sec.

47:23.448 --> 47:26.614
Dr. White.
Uh, Sarah... Wells outside.

47:26.616 --> 47:27.919
<i>Yeah.</i>

47:29.120 --> 47:31.721
- Thanks a lot.
- Yeah.

47:31.723 --> 47:34.692
- Did-did she leave?
- No. She's right there.

47:42.466 --> 47:44.033
I'm here to see Dr. White.

47:44.035 --> 47:45.433
That's me. How can I help you?

47:45.435 --> 47:48.737
- I'm sorry. Scott White?
- I'm Scott White.

47:48.739 --> 47:50.375
<i>W-what's your name?</i>

47:51.576 --> 47:53.475
Sarah Wells.

47:53.477 --> 47:56.712
Sarah Wells.
That's funny, I guess.

47:56.714 --> 47:58.614
Actually, it's not funny,
alright?

47:58.616 --> 48:02.685
I don't understand. I know
Sarah Wells, you're not her.

48:02.687 --> 48:06.721
- Is she a patient here?
- I couldn't tell you that.

48:06.723 --> 48:08.526
Then who am I?

48:09.426 --> 48:11.062
You tell me.

48:12.497 --> 48:14.299
Are you married?

48:15.665 --> 48:17.468
I'm-I'm sorry, what?

48:20.270 --> 48:21.703
I think I made a mistake.

48:21.705 --> 48:23.505
Wait, wait, wait.
Do you-do you know Sarah Wells?

48:23.507 --> 48:25.241
Can you tell me who you are?

48:25.243 --> 48:27.045
Are you restoring an old house?

48:28.478 --> 48:30.415
Who told you that?

48:32.450 --> 48:34.817
Wait, m-miss,
who told you about...

48:34.819 --> 48:36.652
Miss?

48:36.654 --> 48:38.654
Miss. Miss.

48:38.656 --> 48:40.592
Miss, you don't have to go.

48:59.076 --> 49:00.344
<i>Sarah?</i>

49:02.145 --> 49:04.647
<i>Go away. Go away. Go away!</i>

49:04.649 --> 49:06.651
<i>Go away! Go away! Go away!</i>

49:07.752 --> 49:09.221
<i>Go away!</i>

50:02.806 --> 50:04.475
Come in.

50:05.542 --> 50:07.308
Good morning.

50:07.310 --> 50:09.678
How do you explain this?

50:09.680 --> 50:12.147
- How did I get here?
- You don't know?

50:12.149 --> 50:14.718
I remember some things that
you're gonna say aren't real.

50:16.587 --> 50:19.654
The last time I saw you,
I went to sleep at your house.

50:19.656 --> 50:22.227
You don't remember coming back?

50:24.194 --> 50:25.761
You're sleepwalking again.

50:25.763 --> 50:28.864
The police dropped you off at
my house some time after 11:00.

50:28.866 --> 50:30.699
You told them where I live.

50:30.701 --> 50:33.469
I don't remember.

50:33.471 --> 50:34.870
I brought you back here
so we could get you

50:34.872 --> 50:37.306
on the machine.

50:37.308 --> 50:39.674
- I-I've been here all night?
- Yeah.

50:39.676 --> 50:40.845
We both were.

50:42.245 --> 50:44.946
- Are you married?
- No.

50:44.948 --> 50:48.516
- Have you ever been married?
- No.

50:48.518 --> 50:52.221
In my dream, my imagination,
whatever it is...

50:52.223 --> 50:53.325
...you're married.

50:54.357 --> 50:56.759
Another you.

50:56.761 --> 50:59.194
Saw this early on, I didn't
know what to make of it.

50:59.196 --> 51:01.429
<i>It seems as though
you are dreaming at night.</i>

51:01.431 --> 51:03.732
In fact, this line indicates
that you were dreaming

51:03.734 --> 51:05.466
straight through
the entire night.

51:05.468 --> 51:07.303
Am I dreaming right now?

51:07.305 --> 51:09.473
You left deep sleep
and woke up a few minutes ago.

51:12.576 --> 51:14.912
What is it that you remember?

51:17.381 --> 51:18.980
I woke up in that house again.

51:18.982 --> 51:21.783
And I came here
and I met you in the lobby.

51:21.785 --> 51:24.286
But it was another you.

51:24.288 --> 51:26.654
A man called Scott White,
but he worked here.

51:26.656 --> 51:28.924
He was treating a patient.

51:28.926 --> 51:32.564
S-she had my name. I think
I saw her, but she's not me.

51:34.765 --> 51:36.598
I see.

51:36.600 --> 51:39.400
But that's not t-true, right?
I mean, you're Scott White?

51:39.402 --> 51:42.737
Yes. I am Scott White.

51:42.739 --> 51:45.440
In this other world,
who recognizes you?

51:45.442 --> 51:46.841
No one.

51:46.843 --> 51:49.344
So the changes
all have to do with identity.

51:49.346 --> 51:52.714
There's the man who is
leaving me the voicemails.

51:52.716 --> 51:54.583
The one who chased me.

51:54.585 --> 51:56.451
In a dream,
we call that an anchor element.

51:56.453 --> 51:58.886
It connects the waking world
to the world of the dream.

51:58.888 --> 52:00.457
I'm not dreaming.

52:01.658 --> 52:04.359
Tell me something...

52:04.361 --> 52:06.362
And I'm sorry to have to ask.

52:06.364 --> 52:08.364
Your husband's suicide.

52:08.366 --> 52:09.698
Why did he do it?

52:09.700 --> 52:13.504
Uh, he, uh... He, uh...

52:15.806 --> 52:19.411
I... I can't remember.

52:25.049 --> 52:27.485
Um, I can't remember him.

52:29.020 --> 52:30.986
Maybe there was no reason.

52:30.988 --> 52:32.420
No, no, I, uh

52:32.422 --> 52:34.623
went to a psychiatrist
for over a year.

52:34.625 --> 52:36.361
I wrote in my journals about it.

52:37.828 --> 52:39.297
He left a note.

52:42.933 --> 52:44.969
I can't remember right now.
I'm sorry.

53:16.834 --> 53:20.569
Hey... don't you have class?

53:20.571 --> 53:22.607
I'm not going today.

53:48.531 --> 53:51.734
Sarah! Hey.

53:51.736 --> 53:54.770
- Thank you for coming.
- Are you okay?

53:54.772 --> 53:56.772
I want you to see this
on the same screen

53:56.774 --> 53:58.841
that I've been looking at.

53:58.843 --> 54:01.509
- Is this it?
- Mm-hmm.

54:01.511 --> 54:04.112
"Jonathan Alec Grey,
award-winning novelist

54:04.114 --> 54:06.785
"was... murdered...

54:07.752 --> 54:10.386
...November 11th."

54:10.388 --> 54:12.855
It says the man
who stalked him wasn't...

54:12.857 --> 54:15.123
He wasn't murdered.

54:15.125 --> 54:17.025
It says that they found
some of the man's blood

54:17.027 --> 54:19.060
in Jonathan's office,
but they never caught him.

54:19.062 --> 54:20.828
He got away.

54:20.830 --> 54:24.468
But, Scott, Jonathan
wasn't killed, was he?

54:26.803 --> 54:29.673
- But you knew how he died.
- I learned it from you.

54:31.142 --> 54:33.674
Dr. Cooper knew. She told me.

54:33.676 --> 54:35.511
I don't remember any of that.

54:35.513 --> 54:37.946
This could be the man you saw.

54:37.948 --> 54:39.982
I know.

54:39.984 --> 54:42.083
I don't know. What's happening?

54:42.085 --> 54:44.853
I was working so hard at this.
I was getting better.

54:44.855 --> 54:46.621
Let's talk to her and confirm.

54:46.623 --> 54:48.190
She won't remember me.

54:48.192 --> 54:49.757
This could be
your memory coming back.

54:49.759 --> 54:51.826
- It didn't happen.
- Look...

54:51.828 --> 54:54.495
Memories have a, a way
of working their way back

54:54.497 --> 54:56.799
to the surface of consciousness.

54:56.801 --> 54:58.801
It doesn't always make sense.

54:58.803 --> 55:01.573
He wasn't murdered. I remember.

55:22.725 --> 55:24.561
Hello.

56:08.004 --> 56:09.773
You know me.

56:34.131 --> 56:37.602
Help me! Help, please.
He's trying to kill me.

56:56.953 --> 56:58.022
Sarah.

56:59.189 --> 57:00.922
- Hey.
- He was here.

57:03.761 --> 57:05.826
- He-he was inside...
- It's okay.

57:05.828 --> 57:06.895
- He grabbed me, he tried to...
- It's okay.

57:06.897 --> 57:08.663
Nobody's here. Nobody's here.

57:08.665 --> 57:11.132
You're safe now. Okay?

57:11.134 --> 57:12.567
Okay.

57:39.830 --> 57:41.699
You don't believe me.

57:46.370 --> 57:48.239
<i>You-you-you don't believe me.</i>

57:49.707 --> 57:52.007
He was right...

57:52.009 --> 57:53.942
Uh...

57:53.944 --> 57:55.978
He was...

57:55.980 --> 57:58.716
Why don't they catch...
I don't under...

57:59.382 --> 58:01.151
I know.

58:12.261 --> 58:15.763
<i>Dr. Koslov... showed me this.</i>

58:15.765 --> 58:17.632
<i>He said you filled it out.</i>

58:17.634 --> 58:18.835
I didn't.

58:20.303 --> 58:23.038
Have you had
any dreams like this?

58:23.040 --> 58:25.373
No. I didn't fill it out.

58:25.375 --> 58:27.743
Sarah, I need you to be calm.

58:27.745 --> 58:29.944
We need to look
at what's happening.

58:29.946 --> 58:31.679
These perceptual issues are...

58:31.681 --> 58:33.415
- I don't wanna stay here.
- <i>She can stay with me.</i>

58:33.417 --> 58:35.250
Sarah needs professional help.

58:35.252 --> 58:37.351
This isn't something
we have a choice about.

58:37.353 --> 58:39.087
She has to be
taken somewhere safe.

58:39.089 --> 58:40.888
Until these episodes
are resolved

58:40.890 --> 58:42.357
you need professional help.

58:42.359 --> 58:45.259
<i>Scott and I are both bound
by the law on this.</i>

58:45.261 --> 58:49.163
<i>This doesn't make sense to me.
How can it make sense to you?</i>

58:49.165 --> 58:51.366
- You think that I'm lying?
- <i>No, you're not.</i>

58:51.368 --> 58:53.605
But we need to understand
and to help you.

58:54.904 --> 58:56.370
We need to check you
in to the clinic

58:56.372 --> 58:58.105
just for a couple of nights.

58:58.107 --> 59:00.308
<i>For observation.
W-well, just for rel...</i>

59:00.310 --> 59:01.743
No.

59:01.745 --> 59:02.777
<i>I'll come with you.</i>

59:02.779 --> 59:04.279
<i>I wanna help.</i>

59:04.281 --> 59:06.848
I can't be alone.
Not in a place like that.

59:06.850 --> 59:08.118
What if it doesn't help?

59:13.122 --> 59:14.922
I-i-it didn't happen.

59:14.924 --> 59:16.725
He wasn't there. I imagined it.

59:16.727 --> 59:18.359
I won't tell anyone.

59:18.361 --> 59:20.094
I'll go with you to the clinic.

59:20.096 --> 59:22.065
You-you're not gonna be
on your own.

59:23.132 --> 59:25.069
I'd like to admit a patient.

59:27.303 --> 59:29.103
<i>Her name is Sarah Wells.</i>

59:37.714 --> 59:39.114
Yes, we have a room ready.

59:39.116 --> 59:42.850
I'm gonna be all alone.
What-what if I wanna leave?

59:42.852 --> 59:46.288
Uh, for the first 24 hours,
you'll be in our care.

59:46.290 --> 59:48.489
Well, what if I need to leave?

59:48.491 --> 59:49.960
You won't be able to.

59:54.997 --> 59:56.330
- <i>Hey, guys.</i>
- It's okay.

59:56.332 --> 59:57.899
- <i>Come on, take it easy, okay?</i>
- Let go of me!

59:57.901 --> 59:59.234
- Take it easy.
- Let go of me!

59:59.236 --> 01:00:01.502
- She'll be alright.
- Come on.

01:00:01.504 --> 01:00:03.871
- Please, get off me!
- It'll be alright.

01:00:03.873 --> 01:00:07.141
God, please, please, please...

01:00:08.511 --> 01:00:11.011
God!

01:00:55.125 --> 01:00:56.861
You see, I have to go home.

01:00:58.294 --> 01:01:00.228
But I'll be back
first thing in the morning.

01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:01.332
Promise.

01:01:04.835 --> 01:01:07.338
I'm sorry...
that we have to do this.

01:01:10.439 --> 01:01:12.440
<i>And this is the right thing.</i>

01:01:37.167 --> 01:01:38.803
Elaine, I'm comin' over.

01:02:18.642 --> 01:02:21.009
Hey, thanks for meeting me.

01:02:21.011 --> 01:02:23.210
Sorry to make you leave
your house again so late.

01:02:23.212 --> 01:02:26.248
It's fine. This really
upset you, I can see that.

01:02:26.250 --> 01:02:29.049
But from what you had told me,
you're doing the right thing.

01:02:29.051 --> 01:02:31.018
I won't lose another patient.

01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:34.355
I can't. I have to help her.

01:02:34.357 --> 01:02:36.391
You are helping her.

01:02:36.393 --> 01:02:37.591
Did you bring her file?

01:02:37.593 --> 01:02:39.594
I thought it was here.

01:02:39.596 --> 01:02:42.163
I don't see why it would be.

01:02:42.165 --> 01:02:44.132
What's the patient's name again?

01:02:44.134 --> 01:02:46.134
- What?
- The girl.

01:02:46.136 --> 01:02:47.935
The one you told me about.

01:02:47.937 --> 01:02:49.272
Sarah Wells.

01:02:50.908 --> 01:02:52.009
You don't know her?

01:02:54.143 --> 01:02:57.247
No, but... Have I met her?

01:02:58.948 --> 01:03:01.084
Why did you change your clothes?

01:03:01.919 --> 01:03:03.451
What?

01:03:03.453 --> 01:03:05.319
Did we see each other?

01:03:05.321 --> 01:03:06.423
Earlier today?

01:03:07.690 --> 01:03:09.292
No...

01:03:23.205 --> 01:03:24.505
I'm taking her out.

01:03:24.507 --> 01:03:26.540
- Who?
- Sarah Wells. Where is she?

01:03:26.542 --> 01:03:29.243
Oh, you can't. You've not got
the proper authorization.

01:03:29.245 --> 01:03:31.348
What room is she in now?

01:03:33.517 --> 01:03:36.520
Alright. Alright.

01:03:43.026 --> 01:03:44.558
<i>She can't be conscious.</i>

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:47.027
She shouldn't be able
to open her eyes.

01:03:47.029 --> 01:03:48.263
What have you got her on?

01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:51.167
A lot.

01:04:01.277 --> 01:04:02.444
I've got you.

01:04:09.419 --> 01:04:10.388
I'm taking you home.

01:04:25.035 --> 01:04:27.234
You're gonna be okay.
You just need to go to sleep.

01:04:27.236 --> 01:04:28.268
Mm-hmm, I can't
go back to sleep.

01:04:28.270 --> 01:04:29.304
<i>Yes, you can.</i>

01:04:29.306 --> 01:04:30.772
Sarah, listen to me, you can.

01:04:30.774 --> 01:04:32.406
No, no. I put that
out of the...

01:04:32.408 --> 01:04:34.241
Sarah, listen to me.

01:04:34.243 --> 01:04:35.777
I went to see Elaine Cooper...

01:04:35.779 --> 01:04:37.545
...after I left you
at the clinic.

01:04:37.547 --> 01:04:39.681
<i>When I went to see her,
she didn't know who you were.</i>

01:04:39.683 --> 01:04:41.415
What do you mean?

01:04:41.417 --> 01:04:44.219
- What does that mean?
- I don't know. I don't know.

01:04:44.221 --> 01:04:45.620
This is what I was
trying to tell you...

01:04:45.622 --> 01:04:47.522
...but I will, I will.
I promise.

01:04:47.524 --> 01:04:49.357
We're gonna make sense
of all of this, yeah?

01:04:49.359 --> 01:04:53.060
Yeah, okay, keep talking to me
so I don't go back to sleep.

01:04:53.062 --> 01:04:55.529
I can't go back to sleep.
Don't make me go...

01:04:55.531 --> 01:04:56.730
- You have to go to sleep.
- No.

01:04:56.732 --> 01:04:58.165
Yes, you do.

01:04:58.167 --> 01:05:00.100
Then I don't wanna go back to...

01:05:02.305 --> 01:05:04.406
There you go. There you go.

01:05:04.408 --> 01:05:05.739
I need to stay awake.

01:05:05.741 --> 01:05:07.377
I'm not goin' anywhere.

01:05:10.614 --> 01:05:12.246
Let's go to sleep.

01:05:12.248 --> 01:05:14.149
Okay.

01:06:44.406 --> 01:06:46.509
All morning I've been
remembering things.

01:06:49.312 --> 01:06:51.145
The man who tried to hurt me

01:06:51.147 --> 01:06:53.281
his name was Warren Lambert.

01:06:53.283 --> 01:06:55.716
<i>He was obsessed
with my husband's books.</i>

01:06:55.718 --> 01:06:58.154
He's crazy. They sent him
to an institution for it.

01:07:02.225 --> 01:07:04.194
<i>I know that
he wasn't really there.</i>

01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:06.861
No...

01:07:06.863 --> 01:07:10.364
That could be the way
your mind is remembering him.

01:07:10.366 --> 01:07:11.699
I know.

01:07:11.701 --> 01:07:13.637
<i>Tell me what happened
to your husband.</i>

01:07:26.283 --> 01:07:30.284
It was cold. Raining.

01:07:30.286 --> 01:07:32.723
<i>My husband had gone
to a reading to sign books.</i>

01:07:34.491 --> 01:07:36.223
You have to understand
how much people

01:07:36.225 --> 01:07:38.426
love my husband's work.

01:07:38.428 --> 01:07:39.630
Women especially.

01:07:41.497 --> 01:07:43.800
<i>Still, I always knew
we were safe.</i>

01:07:45.602 --> 01:07:46.870
<i>We were us.</i>

01:07:50.339 --> 01:07:52.609
<i>I thought
I'd surprise him in his office.</i>

01:07:57.714 --> 01:08:00.480
<i>And then,
right in front of me</i>

01:08:00.482 --> 01:08:03.384
<i>my mind did somersaults
trying to explain it.</i>

01:08:04.421 --> 01:08:05.890
<i>There must be a mistake.</i>

01:08:07.256 --> 01:08:08.258
<i>But no...</i>

01:08:09.792 --> 01:08:11.426
<i>...she was there.</i>

01:08:11.428 --> 01:08:13.393
<i>He admits it.</i>

01:08:13.395 --> 01:08:16.395
He's sorry, he hates himself.

01:08:16.398 --> 01:08:19.866
What is that? What am I
supposed to do with that?

01:08:22.706 --> 01:08:25.740
<i>He told me
it would never happen again.</i>

01:08:25.742 --> 01:08:27.741
<i>Told her on the phone
while I listened.</i>

01:08:27.743 --> 01:08:30.714
But I knew
I had to leave and I did.

01:08:32.514 --> 01:08:34.848
<i>And after that,
everything got dark.</i>

01:08:34.850 --> 01:08:36.286
<i>All those nights alone.</i>

01:08:37.886 --> 01:08:40.189
<i>He called,
but I n-never answered.</i>

01:08:41.858 --> 01:08:43.260
<i>I left him.</i>

01:08:44.661 --> 01:08:46.426
But...

01:08:46.429 --> 01:08:49.600
No... her.

01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:53.770
There was something wrong
with her in her mind.

01:08:55.470 --> 01:08:56.773
Of course there was.

01:08:58.875 --> 01:09:02.276
She went to his office.
He told her that it was over.

01:09:02.278 --> 01:09:03.710
The neighbors heard him.

01:09:03.712 --> 01:09:05.916
Telling her,
yelling at her to go, but...

01:09:07.783 --> 01:09:08.852
<i>...she had a gun.</i>

01:09:12.455 --> 01:09:13.924
<i>She shot him.</i>

01:09:18.928 --> 01:09:21.863
She... killed my husband.

01:10:41.144 --> 01:10:43.347
Ah!

01:10:46.882 --> 01:10:48.615
Stop it. Stop it.

01:10:57.961 --> 01:11:00.762
<i>You're not goin' anywhere.</i>

01:11:33.796 --> 01:11:36.897
<i>Thanks for ringing.
Thanks.</i>

01:11:36.899 --> 01:11:39.836
Apparently, he was locked up
for this once before.

01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:45.007
<i>Miss Foster?</i>

01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:53.015
Thank you.

01:11:55.652 --> 01:11:56.787
My name.

01:11:57.987 --> 01:12:00.491
Look. It's Foster.

01:15:00.269 --> 01:15:01.738
Who are you?

01:15:04.907 --> 01:15:06.874
Who are you?

01:15:06.876 --> 01:15:09.276
Go away. Go away. Go away.

01:15:09.278 --> 01:15:11.248
Go away. Get out of here.

01:16:01.063 --> 01:16:02.331
Go away.

01:16:04.032 --> 01:16:07.735
Leave me alone! Leave me alone.

01:16:09.037 --> 01:16:10.905
- Sarah? Sarah, it's alright.
- No.

01:16:10.907 --> 01:16:13.740
Look! She's here. It's her.

01:16:13.742 --> 01:16:16.142
She's there. Right there.
Don't you see her?

01:16:16.144 --> 01:16:17.712
- There's no one here.
- <i>I'm-I'm not asleep.</i>

01:16:17.714 --> 01:16:19.446
It's-it's you and me, that's it.

01:16:19.448 --> 01:16:21.481
She's here.
She's... Get away, get away.

01:16:21.483 --> 01:16:23.116
She's right there.
Don't hurt me. Don't...

01:16:23.118 --> 01:16:25.319
Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

01:16:25.321 --> 01:16:27.754
- Why can't you see her?
- What the hell's going on?

01:16:27.756 --> 01:16:31.092
- She right there...
- There is no one here.

01:16:31.094 --> 01:16:33.227
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>
- <i>There's no one there.</i>

01:16:33.229 --> 01:16:37.964
Look, it's you and me.
Th-there is no one here.

01:16:37.966 --> 01:16:41.000
- <i>She's right there.</i>
- It's okay. Look at me.

01:16:41.002 --> 01:16:43.103
Look at me. Do you trust me?

01:16:43.105 --> 01:16:46.906
You need to lay down.
Lay down, it's okay.

01:16:46.908 --> 01:16:49.910
Lay down, lay down, it's okay.

01:16:49.912 --> 01:16:52.780
I don't understand.
What's happening?

01:16:52.782 --> 01:16:56.286
- She's dreaming of me.
- What? Why?

01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:00.857
Think. There has to be a reason.

01:17:04.292 --> 01:17:06.259
Maybe she's already told us.

01:17:17.974 --> 01:17:21.808
It's always her. The same woman.

01:17:21.810 --> 01:17:23.811
She finds me.

01:17:23.813 --> 01:17:26.112
She comes inside my house.

01:17:26.114 --> 01:17:28.915
She watches me.

01:17:28.917 --> 01:17:32.253
<i>She watches me
while I'm sleeping.</i>

01:17:32.255 --> 01:17:35.054
<i>I can't feel safe
in my own home.</i>

01:17:35.056 --> 01:17:37.458
<i>I lock the doors</i>

01:17:37.460 --> 01:17:40.230
<i>but she must have the keys.</i>

01:17:42.297 --> 01:17:44.531
At night...

01:17:44.533 --> 01:17:47.269
...I see her
waiting across the street.

01:17:48.871 --> 01:17:51.440
<i>Just watching and waiting.</i>

01:17:54.076 --> 01:17:56.846
<i>Why can't I get her
out of my head?</i>

01:18:23.572 --> 01:18:25.307
I knew you'd be here.

01:18:28.243 --> 01:18:30.610
- <i>Jonathan?</i>
- Stop.

01:18:30.612 --> 01:18:33.079
I told you.
You can't come here.

01:18:33.081 --> 01:18:35.017
I'm not going anywhere.
It's raining.

01:18:39.154 --> 01:18:41.222
How about we stay in?

01:18:41.224 --> 01:18:42.793
<i>I'm calling the police.</i>

01:18:44.026 --> 01:18:45.261
Stop.

01:18:48.997 --> 01:18:51.932
Wait. Please.

01:18:51.934 --> 01:18:53.537
<i>Please. Stop.</i>

01:18:56.005 --> 01:18:57.507
<i>Please.</i>

01:19:01.611 --> 01:19:05.378
She's here
because she's having nightmares.

01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:07.116
And he's helping her.

01:19:08.550 --> 01:19:12.018
- You.
- What?

01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:14.288
<i>The actual you.</i>

01:19:14.290 --> 01:19:16.356
<i>And when he finds a cure, I...</i>

01:19:16.358 --> 01:19:18.828
...don't know
what's going to happen.

01:19:20.929 --> 01:19:23.463
I'm her nightmare.

01:19:23.465 --> 01:19:25.100
That's not possible.

01:19:27.103 --> 01:19:29.038
There has to be explanation.

01:19:55.965 --> 01:19:58.101
<i>I loved Jonathan Grey.</i>

01:20:02.571 --> 01:20:04.338
<i>I-I wasn't his wife.</i>

01:20:07.143 --> 01:20:08.979
<i>I was the other woman.</i>

01:20:10.513 --> 01:20:12.413
<i>My name is Anna.</i>

01:20:36.505 --> 01:20:38.408
I remember now.

01:20:39.975 --> 01:20:42.042
The moment I put
the gun to my head

01:20:42.044 --> 01:20:44.680
and everything went dark.

01:20:46.514 --> 01:20:48.584
The next thing I saw was this.

01:20:50.353 --> 01:20:53.989
I was in this place,
walking towards you.

01:20:56.492 --> 01:20:58.261
Do you feel how warm it is?

01:20:59.161 --> 01:21:00.397
What?

01:21:02.732 --> 01:21:05.602
It's November, not summer.

01:21:07.002 --> 01:21:09.706
I guess I didn't
want it to be cold.

01:21:11.239 --> 01:21:14.508
I-I wanted to be in this place.

01:21:14.510 --> 01:21:16.546
To be the love of his life.

01:21:18.613 --> 01:21:22.649
You said the clues in what I
was seeing were about identity.

01:21:22.651 --> 01:21:25.119
- <i>And you were right.</i>
- No.

01:21:25.121 --> 01:21:26.652
Listen.

01:21:26.654 --> 01:21:29.455
What we are experiencing,
both of us...

01:21:29.457 --> 01:21:32.493
<i>...it's something else,
it's a fugue state, it's a...</i>

01:21:32.495 --> 01:21:34.096
It's love.

01:21:36.398 --> 01:21:38.600
Because he is you.

01:21:40.036 --> 01:21:41.404
<i>I made you.</i>

01:21:42.705 --> 01:21:45.207
Maybe so that
I could see that I...

01:21:46.642 --> 01:21:48.377
So that I could find the truth.

01:21:49.711 --> 01:21:51.411
So that I could see
what I had done.

01:21:53.616 --> 01:21:56.419
<i>But I-I know
that I would find you again.</i>

01:21:58.821 --> 01:22:01.123
I don't want this to end.

01:22:03.591 --> 01:22:06.160
Sarah.

01:22:39.194 --> 01:22:41.497
<i>Don't worry, Anna.</i>

01:23:52.934 --> 01:23:55.370
<i>My name is Sarah Foster.</i>
