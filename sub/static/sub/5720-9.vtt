00:09.441 --> 00:11.213

00:11.954 --> 00:13.358

00:14.042 --> 00:15.579
_

00:16.527 --> 00:18.160
_

00:21.471 --> 00:22.995
You have made a very big mistake,

00:22.996 --> 00:24.163
Mr. Dalton.

00:24.164 --> 00:26.298
I can't imagine what you hoped to achieve

00:26.299 --> 00:28.867
with this vicious and unwarranted attack

00:28.868 --> 00:30.302
but I promise you,

00:30.303 --> 00:33.005
we will meet you in equal measure.

00:33.006 --> 00:35.607
President Ostrov, I can assure you

00:35.608 --> 00:37.576
that the United States
is just learning of this

00:37.577 --> 00:38.744
with the rest of the world.

00:38.745 --> 00:40.612
Your lies are beneath you.

00:40.613 --> 00:43.315
And they are an insult to
myself and the Russian people.

00:43.316 --> 00:44.716
You will pay for this.

00:44.717 --> 00:47.219
I am flattered that you think
we could organize a cyber attack

00:47.220 --> 00:50.322
capable of crippling a city of
Moscow's power and magnitude.

00:50.323 --> 00:52.257
If we had managed to pull that together,

00:52.258 --> 00:53.625
it would have to be in response

00:53.626 --> 00:55.260
to something equally unprecedented.

00:55.261 --> 00:57.262
Like someone hacking into

00:57.263 --> 00:58.931
the navigation and communication system

00:58.932 --> 01:00.332
on Air Force One,

01:00.333 --> 01:02.534
putting the lives of all on board at risk.

01:02.535 --> 01:04.069
You are insane.

01:04.069 --> 01:06.371
Russia never hacked Air Force One.

01:06.372 --> 01:08.941
And the U.S. didn't black out Moscow.

01:08.942 --> 01:11.810
So we can part on neutral ground.

01:11.811 --> 01:13.846
No, we will part on my promise

01:13.847 --> 01:17.182
that Russia will not stand for
this affront to its sovereignty,

01:17.183 --> 01:20.886
and retaliatory measures
will be taken immediately.

01:22.822 --> 01:24.323
Well, I like her.

01:24.324 --> 01:25.691
She's got moxie.

01:25.692 --> 01:28.060
Mr. President, I think we can file that one

01:28.061 --> 01:29.294
under "message received."

01:29.295 --> 01:30.762
Am I the only one

01:30.763 --> 01:32.664
concerned about her subtle

01:32.665 --> 01:33.899
vows of retaliation?

01:33.900 --> 01:35.000
Par for the course.

01:35.001 --> 01:36.835
That's pretty much the clarion call

01:36.836 --> 01:38.003
of any aggrieved demagogue.

01:38.004 --> 01:40.272
Actually, the smart thing

01:40.273 --> 01:43.041
for her to do would be to
deny the U.S.'s involvement.

01:43.042 --> 01:45.711
Spare herself the
embarrassment of taking the hit.

01:45.712 --> 01:47.012
So we're betting on smart?

01:47.013 --> 01:50.082
The fact that she's even
running the show is theater.

01:50.083 --> 01:51.717
She's gonna listen to the counsel

01:51.718 --> 01:53.051
of her generals and advisors.

01:53.052 --> 01:53.986
They understand the cost

01:53.987 --> 01:55.487
of a military response.

01:55.488 --> 01:57.189
And we can track any
movement in that regard.

01:57.190 --> 01:59.191
But we're not too concerned.

01:59.192 --> 02:00.559
She's been put in her place.

02:00.560 --> 02:03.262
And she knows we won't tolerate any signs

02:03.263 --> 02:05.330
of aggression toward us or Ukraine.

02:05.331 --> 02:06.798
All right. Well...

02:06.799 --> 02:11.036
I'll get to work on
State's non-denial denial.

02:11.037 --> 02:13.171
Make it a full-throttle denial.

02:13.172 --> 02:15.040
Lying to save the world is allowed.

02:15.041 --> 02:16.341
It's in the Constitution.

02:16.342 --> 02:17.409
Okay.

02:17.410 --> 02:18.911
Where the cyber attack is concerned,

02:18.912 --> 02:21.213
we're in the dark right along with them.

02:21.214 --> 02:22.247
That's good.

02:22.248 --> 02:24.249
I'm not really going to say that.

02:24.250 --> 02:26.184
I would.

02:26.185 --> 02:27.486
Thanks, everyone.

02:27.487 --> 02:29.755
Is it wrong to eat cereal for dinner?

02:29.756 --> 02:31.489
I don't care.

02:33.859 --> 02:35.994
So how was your day, Slugger?

02:35.995 --> 02:37.629
Or... Boomer.

02:37.630 --> 02:39.998
What is the universal linebacker nickname?

02:39.999 --> 02:42.466
- Brainless.
- Be nice.

02:42.968 --> 02:44.870
So this horse

02:44.871 --> 02:46.838
walks into the doctor's office.

02:46.839 --> 02:48.206
The doctor says...

02:48.207 --> 02:49.741
- why the long face?
- ...why the long face?

02:49.742 --> 02:50.842
I don't know.

02:50.843 --> 02:52.377
I just love that.

02:52.378 --> 02:53.478
It gets me every time.

02:53.479 --> 02:55.380
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

02:55.381 --> 02:56.548
So?

02:56.549 --> 02:58.617
What's up?

02:58.618 --> 03:02.154
I, uh, just got some
bad news from the coach.

03:02.155 --> 03:03.555
Oh, no.

03:03.556 --> 03:05.157
- Is he cutting you?
- No.

03:05.158 --> 03:06.391
He's, uh, he's starting me.

03:06.392 --> 03:08.727
- Well...
- Wow.

03:08.728 --> 03:09.995
- ...hey, that's great.
- I mean...

03:09.996 --> 03:12.331
I'd think you'd be excited about that.

03:12.332 --> 03:13.999
We're facing the biggest team

03:14.000 --> 03:15.867
in the league, with the
playoffs on the line,

03:15.868 --> 03:16.969
and suddenly it's my turn?

03:16.970 --> 03:18.737
Well, Jason, he must have seen

03:18.738 --> 03:20.472
a lot of progress in practice.

03:20.473 --> 03:21.907
- Otherwise, he wouldn't put you in.
- Yeah.

03:21.908 --> 03:23.108
Nice try, Dad.

03:23.109 --> 03:25.110
Derrick got benched for a "D" in geometry,

03:25.111 --> 03:26.979
Eli broke his arm and
Gabe's moving to Florida.

03:26.980 --> 03:29.014
So I'm sort of forced into this one.

03:29.015 --> 03:31.850
Are you afraid you're going to get hurt?

03:31.851 --> 03:33.218
No, I'm worried about being humiliated

03:33.219 --> 03:34.353
and letting the whole team,

03:34.354 --> 03:35.954
and in fact the whole school, down.

03:35.955 --> 03:37.522
I mean, I did this to make friends

03:37.523 --> 03:39.558
and I'm about to alienate everyone I know.

03:39.559 --> 03:41.159
Jace, it's gonna be okay.

03:41.160 --> 03:43.195
Or maybe you won't even play.

03:43.196 --> 03:45.364
Everyone's saying that
Russia's going to retaliate

03:45.365 --> 03:46.632
for the cyber attack.

03:46.633 --> 03:48.399
Hard to have Friday Night
Lights with no lights.

03:48.400 --> 03:49.868
What cyber attack?

03:49.869 --> 03:51.136
Where did you get this?

03:51.137 --> 03:52.604
Um... every major news outlet?

03:52.605 --> 03:55.574
Yeah, well, it's all speculation.

03:55.575 --> 03:57.342
There's no evidence of an attack.

03:57.343 --> 03:59.544
Why don't you kids go eat in
front of the TV? Sound good?

03:59.545 --> 04:02.012
Okay, now I know the world is ending.

04:05.784 --> 04:07.019
So...

04:07.020 --> 04:08.285
Was it us?

04:09.521 --> 04:12.157
Russia has an antiquated infrastructure.

04:12.158 --> 04:14.292
The blackout could be

04:14.293 --> 04:15.594
the Chernobyl of the power grid.

04:15.595 --> 04:18.262
Okay, I know that we can't divulge stuff,

04:18.264 --> 04:20.098
but I didn't know we'd moved
on to spinning each other.

04:20.099 --> 04:21.533
I'm just giving you

04:21.534 --> 04:23.669
what the White House's
official position is.

04:23.670 --> 04:25.370
Okay, let's try this:

04:25.371 --> 04:26.738
If it was us, was it in response

04:26.739 --> 04:28.183
to what happened on Air Force One?

04:28.184 --> 04:30.308
Solar flares happened on Air Force One.

04:30.309 --> 04:31.810
I was read in to that one.

04:31.811 --> 04:33.244
I know about the malware.

04:35.013 --> 04:37.082
Well... but not who was behind it,

04:37.083 --> 04:38.650
because we didn't know.

04:38.651 --> 04:39.785
And we do now?

04:39.786 --> 04:41.119
Are you okay?

04:41.120 --> 04:44.022
'Cause I know that you've
been very stressed out.

04:44.023 --> 04:45.857
Don't gaslight me.

04:45.858 --> 04:47.893
I... You're the one who's been all worried

04:47.894 --> 04:49.227
about us keeping secrets.

04:49.228 --> 04:50.629
That was just venting.

04:50.630 --> 04:52.564
This is real world.

04:52.565 --> 04:55.534
Henry, we almost went to...

04:55.535 --> 04:59.838
to prison for sharing
classified information.

04:59.839 --> 05:01.239
So we cannot talk.

05:01.240 --> 05:03.542
I thought maybe being on
the verge of World War III

05:03.543 --> 05:05.143
might change the rules.

05:05.144 --> 05:06.911
Nope.

05:10.682 --> 05:13.351
Can we maybe just... stop talking

05:13.352 --> 05:16.088
about what we may or
may not be talking about?

05:16.089 --> 05:18.255
Sure.

05:22.360 --> 05:23.462
Where are you going?

05:23.463 --> 05:25.095
Can't talk about it.

05:27.000 --> 05:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:35.511 --> 05:37.709
Do you know anything about
the situation in Russia?

05:37.710 --> 05:39.111
Nothing.

05:39.112 --> 05:40.846
I could speculate, but DIA hasn't

05:40.847 --> 05:42.514
read me into anything.

05:42.515 --> 05:43.949
- Any word from Dmitri?
- No.

05:43.950 --> 05:46.618
I don't know how long he stayed in Moscow

05:46.619 --> 05:48.353
after he contacted us.

05:48.354 --> 05:49.821
Did he feel like he'd been compromised?

05:49.822 --> 05:51.056
He didn't say anything,

05:51.057 --> 05:53.024
but it could be the
reason that he wanted out.

05:53.025 --> 05:55.627
That would be unfortunate.

05:55.628 --> 05:57.129
Has the president seen
the battle plan report

05:57.130 --> 05:58.597
from Doroshevich?

05:58.598 --> 06:00.132
The president? No.

06:00.133 --> 06:01.333
Uh, why would he?

06:01.334 --> 06:02.801
He might be interested to know

06:02.802 --> 06:04.402
about a planned attack on Ukraine.

06:04.403 --> 06:06.738
You think he doesn't know
Russia has designs on Ukraine?

06:06.739 --> 06:10.041
He might also be interested
in what wasn't in the report.

06:10.042 --> 06:11.409
What would that be?

06:11.410 --> 06:15.013
Any plan to attack the computer
system of Air Force One.

06:15.014 --> 06:17.182
Okay, I'm not connecting the dots here.

06:17.183 --> 06:20.252
If the blackout was an attack by the U.S.,

06:20.253 --> 06:21.486
they went under the assumption

06:21.487 --> 06:23.421
that Russia was behind
the hack of Air Force One.

06:23.422 --> 06:24.456
Okay.

06:24.457 --> 06:25.657
The playbook that Dmitri gave us

06:25.658 --> 06:28.026
laid out Russia's entire strategy

06:28.027 --> 06:29.761
for the invasion of Ukraine,

06:29.762 --> 06:31.797
including aggressive diversionary tactics

06:31.798 --> 06:32.898
to deter U.S. involvement.

06:32.899 --> 06:35.133
Okay, what is your ETA on the point, Henry?

06:35.134 --> 06:37.435
Gamed out every crazy scenario,

06:37.436 --> 06:39.671
from taking over Arctic drilling sites

06:39.672 --> 06:41.406
to instigating conflict with ISIS.

06:41.407 --> 06:42.841
But there was nothing...

06:42.842 --> 06:47.979
nothing about a hack of Air Force One.

06:47.980 --> 06:50.248
Just because they didn't
put it in the report

06:50.249 --> 06:51.583
doesn't mean they didn't do it.

06:51.584 --> 06:53.218
You're trying to prove a negative.

06:53.219 --> 06:55.720
You don't want to get
into a dialectic with me.

06:55.721 --> 06:56.988
Okay. You're right.

06:56.989 --> 06:58.557
I don't even want to
have this conversation.

06:58.558 --> 06:59.591
You're crossing lines.

06:59.592 --> 07:01.378
Just tell me you'll make an effort

07:01.379 --> 07:02.943
to get this report to the White House.

07:02.944 --> 07:03.995
How?

07:03.996 --> 07:05.664
Call the President.

07:05.665 --> 07:07.532
Demand to see him.

07:07.533 --> 07:09.334
Henry, you might be
coming a little unglued.

07:09.335 --> 07:11.536
I know you're upset about Dmitri.

07:11.537 --> 07:13.438
At least get it into the
hands of Ephraim Ware.

07:13.439 --> 07:15.073
The DNI needs to know about this.

07:15.074 --> 07:17.242
Stop. You're getting above your pay grade.

07:17.243 --> 07:18.210
And mine.

07:18.211 --> 07:19.344
You've done your duty, Professor.

07:19.345 --> 07:20.545
Let us handle this.

07:58.516 --> 08:00.585
These three pipelines went off-line

08:00.586 --> 08:01.987
approximately two hours ago.

08:01.988 --> 08:04.422
We've received reliable verification

08:04.423 --> 08:06.091
from both U.S. and European intelligence

08:06.092 --> 08:08.560
that the pipelines were shut down

08:08.561 --> 08:10.594
by direct order of Maria Ostrov.

08:11.997 --> 08:13.298
Those particular pipelines

08:13.299 --> 08:16.034
provide 40% of Western
Europe's supply of gas.

08:16.035 --> 08:17.969
Just as they're heading into

08:17.970 --> 08:19.938
one of the fiercest winters
predicted in decades.

08:19.939 --> 08:22.172
So much for blustering.

08:24.075 --> 08:25.277
It's a clear message

08:25.278 --> 08:27.345
that she's not playing by the rules.

08:27.346 --> 08:28.680
She's escalating the conflict.

08:28.681 --> 08:32.183
Turning America's NATO
allies into collateral damage.

08:32.183 --> 08:34.519
Mr. President, they want
to break the alliance

08:34.520 --> 08:36.721
so they can run the
table with Eastern Europe.

08:36.722 --> 08:38.556
It's something Pavel Ostrov coveted

08:38.557 --> 08:40.457
and now she's trying to make it happen.

08:40.458 --> 08:42.727
This has stopped being a dialogue.

08:42.727 --> 08:44.628
It's a march to war.

08:45.797 --> 08:48.066
Then we need to retaliate.

08:48.067 --> 08:50.834
And we need to hit them hard.

08:54.839 --> 09:01.709
<b>Subtitle sync and corrections
by awaqeded for www.addic7ed.com.</b>

09:08.721 --> 09:10.784
We can neutralize the targets in Crimea.

09:10.785 --> 09:11.885
Air strikes to follow,

09:11.886 --> 09:12.886
to address any aggression

09:12.887 --> 09:13.954
on the Ukraine border.

09:13.955 --> 09:15.722
And, worst-case scenario,

09:15.723 --> 09:16.723
boots on the ground.

09:16.724 --> 09:18.258
Just enough to make a point.

09:18.259 --> 09:20.360
And what point is that?

09:20.361 --> 09:22.341
That we're willing to use military force.

09:22.342 --> 09:24.464
But I thought the point
of the power grid attack

09:24.465 --> 09:26.867
is that we weren't willing to do that.

09:26.868 --> 09:28.869
That was before this latest action.

09:28.870 --> 09:31.038
You had to know they would respond.

09:31.039 --> 09:32.239
We honestly thought

09:32.240 --> 09:33.440
it would be much more measured.

09:33.441 --> 09:35.175
This... this is extreme.

09:35.176 --> 09:37.476
They escalated, so we have to.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.648
Why can't we reach out to our allies?

09:41.649 --> 09:44.251
Western Europe's holding
us fully accountable.

09:44.252 --> 09:45.619
They're blaming us for all of it.

09:45.620 --> 09:46.987
Well, of course they are.

09:46.988 --> 09:49.389
Because no one knows what's going on.

09:49.390 --> 09:50.624
We're still calling

09:50.625 --> 09:52.759
Air Force One solar flares.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.393
What are you proposing?

09:55.262 --> 09:57.197
I want to go before the UN.

09:57.198 --> 09:58.732
I want to give them a lay down speech

09:58.733 --> 10:00.934
and spell it out for them,

10:00.935 --> 10:02.235
step by step.

10:02.236 --> 10:05.339
We give evidence of
military overreach by Russia

10:05.340 --> 10:06.807
against the U.S. and Ukraine.

10:06.808 --> 10:10.843
We divulge all of their aggression.

10:11.745 --> 10:13.280
The attack on Air Force One,

10:13.281 --> 10:16.350
the Poloniumed hacker,

10:16.351 --> 10:18.985
the financial records
that point to Russian GRU.

10:18.986 --> 10:21.788
Mr. President, that is a radical

10:21.789 --> 10:22.856
roll of the dice.

10:22.857 --> 10:24.825
Putting all our cards on the table

10:24.826 --> 10:26.193
leaves us nowhere else to turn

10:26.194 --> 10:27.527
if the allies don't go for it.

10:27.528 --> 10:29.359
Which, given the current climate,

10:29.360 --> 10:30.964
I think it's a pretty safe bet they won't.

10:30.965 --> 10:33.934
Nowhere else to turn?

10:33.935 --> 10:36.370
You mean, as opposed to

10:36.371 --> 10:38.071
all those other comfortable options

10:38.072 --> 10:39.806
we'll have after we launch

10:39.807 --> 10:41.742
a full-scale military campaign

10:41.743 --> 10:45.045
against the world's second
biggest nuclear power?

10:45.046 --> 10:48.148
Elizabeth, it's an enormous gamble.

10:48.149 --> 10:49.883
For starters, it would have to be

10:49.884 --> 10:51.017
the speech of your life,

10:51.018 --> 10:53.186
right up there with Adlai Stevenson

10:53.187 --> 10:54.321
in the Cuban Missile Crisis.

10:54.322 --> 10:56.690
I think that's an apt analogy.

10:56.691 --> 10:58.991
And I think I'm up to it.

11:04.631 --> 11:07.033
I don't see what we have to lose.

11:07.034 --> 11:08.301
Sir?

11:08.302 --> 11:10.737
All due respect, everything.

11:10.738 --> 11:12.706
The upper hand, the element of surprise...

11:12.707 --> 11:15.675
General, we forfeited all
that with the cyber attack.

11:15.676 --> 11:17.811
Now we're being pulled into Russia's game.

11:17.812 --> 11:20.447
Escalating the conflict is our only choice,

11:20.448 --> 11:22.916
unless we can get the
allies to circle the wagons.

11:22.917 --> 11:25.252
It's...

11:25.253 --> 11:28.321
it's gonna take the
world's commitment to war

11:28.322 --> 11:30.757
in order to actually stop the war.

11:30.758 --> 11:32.859
It has to happen in the next 24 hours.

11:32.860 --> 11:36.196
We-we cannot give Russia time
to one-up our show of force

11:36.197 --> 11:37.764
should we decide to go there.

11:37.765 --> 11:39.031
Agreed.

11:39.933 --> 11:42.235
Let's get on the line with President Bozek.

11:42.236 --> 11:43.445
We can't do this alone.

11:43.446 --> 11:46.406
We need to get Ukraine on board.

11:46.407 --> 11:49.776
I appreciate you taking me into
your confidence, Mr. President.

11:49.777 --> 11:51.445
Tell me, what is your plan.

11:51.446 --> 11:53.799
We intend to draw a line in the sand.

11:53.800 --> 11:56.735
And that line is the Ukrainian border.

11:56.736 --> 11:59.938
In addition to the, uh, lethal
aide we've already provided,

11:59.939 --> 12:03.367
we plan to send American
advisors to the east

12:03.368 --> 12:06.972
and enforce a no-fly zone
over Ukrainian airspace.

12:06.973 --> 12:08.240
You don't know how long

12:08.241 --> 12:10.709
I've waited to hear these
words of support from you.

12:10.710 --> 12:13.478
Tell me, what can I do in return?

12:13.479 --> 12:16.815
I'm-I'm glad you asked, Mikhail.

12:16.816 --> 12:19.384
All of this will depend on
the support of our allies,

12:19.385 --> 12:23.054
which I have to rally in the next 24 hours.

12:23.055 --> 12:26.091
It won't be easy, so the
more evidence that we have

12:26.092 --> 12:28.894
to convince them that Ostrov
was behind the cyber attack

12:28.895 --> 12:31.396
on your plane and ours, the better.

12:31.397 --> 12:34.332
I'll need any information that you have.

12:34.333 --> 12:36.668
That is easily provided, Madam Secretary.

12:36.669 --> 12:38.837
And I will need you at my side

12:38.838 --> 12:41.106
when I make the address at the U.N.

12:41.107 --> 12:43.675
I will make preparations to
fly to New York right away.

12:43.676 --> 12:45.175
Thank you.

12:48.480 --> 12:51.082
Better get your staff to work

12:51.083 --> 12:53.384
on the speech of your life.

12:58.657 --> 13:00.559
The objective is simple.

13:00.560 --> 13:02.727
Convince the entire world...

13:02.728 --> 13:04.930
particularly our allies...

13:04.931 --> 13:07.666
that we are justified
and willing to go to war

13:07.667 --> 13:09.367
to contain Russian aggression.

13:09.368 --> 13:12.367
So, your basic St. Crispin's Day speech.

13:12.368 --> 13:14.035
Yes.

13:14.036 --> 13:15.837
Hopefully without having to go into battle.

13:15.838 --> 13:17.445
Once we have the authority,

13:17.446 --> 13:19.447
the idea is that we
won't have to enforce it.

13:19.448 --> 13:20.648
That's a big risk.

13:20.649 --> 13:22.616
We're aware.

13:22.617 --> 13:24.719
How much of the classified stuff

13:24.720 --> 13:25.952
do you want me to use?

13:25.953 --> 13:27.821
Outside of sources and methods,

13:27.822 --> 13:30.957
the president has authorized all of it.

13:30.958 --> 13:32.325
- All of it.
- All if it?

13:32.326 --> 13:34.494
We're giving up George Lasko as the guy

13:34.495 --> 13:35.729
who hacked Air Force One?

13:35.730 --> 13:37.097
His connection to Russia?

13:37.098 --> 13:38.899
The attack on President Bozek's plane?

13:38.900 --> 13:40.333
The Polonium assassination...?

13:40.334 --> 13:42.869
That pretty much covers
what I mean by "all of it."

13:42.870 --> 13:44.871
If we are showing our entire hand,

13:44.872 --> 13:47.504
it means the end of
any kind of negotiation.

13:47.505 --> 13:49.508
That's why this speech has to work.

13:51.149 --> 13:53.451
Hi, welcome to Smokin' Al's.

13:59.889 --> 14:01.724
I only have ten minutes.

14:01.725 --> 14:03.643
That's all I need.

14:03.644 --> 14:06.713
I have to admit I never expected
you to be in a place like this.

14:06.714 --> 14:08.306
Well, that's why we're here.

14:08.307 --> 14:10.542
Does your wife know that you eat like that?

14:10.543 --> 14:11.876
Of course not.

14:11.877 --> 14:14.012
What can I do for you, Henry?

14:14.914 --> 14:17.082
I need to bring you some intelligence

14:17.083 --> 14:18.483
that I've uncovered.

14:18.484 --> 14:21.086
I've taken it as far as I
can with DIA, but it stalled.

14:21.087 --> 14:23.988
I assume you talked to
Jane Fellows about this?

14:23.989 --> 14:25.790
She essentially terminated my assignment,

14:25.791 --> 14:28.193
but you're my original recruiter.

14:28.194 --> 14:29.427
That's where it ends.

14:29.428 --> 14:31.973
Russell, my asset managed to lift

14:31.974 --> 14:35.867
Russia's entire playbook
for the invasion of Ukraine.

14:35.868 --> 14:40.004
They spell out every scenario imaginable,

14:40.005 --> 14:42.507
including a number of ways
to manage the U.S. reaction.

14:42.508 --> 14:45.577
Yet nowhere is this exhaustive document

14:45.578 --> 14:48.979
is there any mention of
hacking Air Force One.

14:50.715 --> 14:53.485
Why are you telling me this now
when we are right in the middle

14:53.486 --> 14:55.987
of a military campaign
against Maria Ostrov?

14:55.988 --> 14:58.590
Before the Challenger exploded...

14:58.591 --> 14:59.385
The space shuttle?

14:59.386 --> 15:01.121
- What kind...? What is...?
- Low-level engineers

15:01.122 --> 15:03.094
discovered serious design
flaws with the shuttle;

15:03.095 --> 15:05.807
particularly related to the O-rings,

15:05.808 --> 15:07.542
which they knew could not withstand

15:07.543 --> 15:09.544
extreme changes in temperature.

15:09.545 --> 15:11.313
They kept pushing the information upstairs,

15:11.314 --> 15:12.481
but it stalled.

15:12.482 --> 15:13.548
Or 9/11...

15:13.549 --> 15:14.516
Here we go.

15:14.517 --> 15:16.084
The CIA and FBI

15:16.085 --> 15:17.319
may have had enough foreknowledge

15:17.320 --> 15:19.321
of Al-Qaeda's plan to stop the attacks,

15:19.322 --> 15:23.058
but because of bureaucratic intransigence,

15:23.059 --> 15:24.860
they never even spoke to one another.

15:24.861 --> 15:26.428
So what, so in this
parable, I'm the lackey,

15:26.429 --> 15:28.797
who waves you off and says
it's above my pay grade?

15:28.798 --> 15:30.699
No, that was Jane Fellows.
You're the guy that never

15:30.700 --> 15:32.234
got the information in the first place.

15:32.235 --> 15:34.136
You have the power to stop this.

15:34.137 --> 15:35.370
Stop what?

15:35.371 --> 15:37.138
We've already engaged.

15:38.507 --> 15:41.510
You mean the cyber
attack on the power grid?

15:41.511 --> 15:43.011
The entire intelligence community believes

15:43.012 --> 15:44.579
Russia was behind Air Force One.

15:44.580 --> 15:45.914
So even if they didn't do it,

15:45.915 --> 15:47.115
they did it, understand...?

15:47.116 --> 15:49.051
There you go.

15:49.052 --> 15:50.752
And you're willing to go to war over that?

15:50.753 --> 15:53.121
We are trying our damnedest to stop a war

15:53.122 --> 15:56.959
by creating a united
front... do you get that?!

15:56.960 --> 15:58.627
If you tell your wife

15:58.628 --> 16:01.463
any of this "Russia didn't do it" nonsense,

16:01.464 --> 16:03.999
based on classified Intel from DIA,

16:04.000 --> 16:05.534
you'll be thrown in prison

16:05.535 --> 16:07.469
for the rest of your mortal days.

16:07.470 --> 16:09.570
Both of you, understood?

16:11.239 --> 16:14.742
Just keep your head
down and your mouth shut.

16:17.646 --> 16:21.148
For God's sake, just do
what we tell you to do.

16:31.348 --> 16:32.828
Well, whoever she is,

16:32.829 --> 16:34.730
I hope she fed you.

16:34.731 --> 16:37.132
We finished off the Kung Pao chicken.

16:37.133 --> 16:39.735
She was an endless seminar
on the Sino-Soviet split

16:39.736 --> 16:42.471
and its effect on the end of the Cold War,

16:42.472 --> 16:45.340
which is ironic given the day's headlines.

16:45.341 --> 16:47.376
Might be a spring roll or two left.

16:47.377 --> 16:49.643
You could have that.

16:50.679 --> 16:52.948
We have to talk.

16:52.949 --> 16:54.416
No, we really don't.

16:54.417 --> 16:56.618
I understand you're scheduled
to speak at the U.N. tomorrow.

16:56.619 --> 16:58.420
That's right.

16:58.421 --> 17:00.255
- What if I knew something that would change
- Stop!

17:00.256 --> 17:01.790
the way that you approach this?

17:01.791 --> 17:03.425
Henry, I-I don't make the decisions

17:03.426 --> 17:04.925
on how to approach this.

17:04.926 --> 17:06.428
You're gonna reveal Russia's involvement

17:06.429 --> 17:08.063
in the Air Force One hack in hopes

17:08.064 --> 17:09.731
of getting the allies to fall into place.

17:09.732 --> 17:11.733
And if you do your job well,

17:11.733 --> 17:13.734
which you have a track record of doing,

17:13.736 --> 17:15.804
then the world will be poised to go to war

17:15.805 --> 17:18.640
with a country that is just unstable enough

17:18.641 --> 17:21.742
to take the bait.

17:21.743 --> 17:23.845
If you're wrong,

17:23.846 --> 17:26.181
do you really want to
be on the side of that?

17:26.182 --> 17:27.949
Well, obviously I wouldn't make this speech

17:27.950 --> 17:29.151
if I thought I were wrong.

17:29.152 --> 17:30.519
At what point would you be willing

17:30.520 --> 17:34.156
to violate this cone of silence between us?

17:34.157 --> 17:36.825
What would it take?

17:36.826 --> 17:38.293
Would millions of lives
have to be at stake?

17:38.294 --> 17:39.428
Because that's where we are.

17:39.429 --> 17:40.829
You're scaring me, Henry.

17:40.830 --> 17:43.130
Good, because this is scary.

17:45.167 --> 17:47.202
I'm willing to roll the
dice on going to prison.

17:47.203 --> 17:49.337
But what I'm not willing to do

17:49.338 --> 17:52.773
is live with what might
happen if we don't talk.

17:55.243 --> 17:57.712
We know things

17:57.713 --> 17:59.214
that can help each other.

17:59.215 --> 18:00.982
That's not the point.

18:00.983 --> 18:02.918
Actually, that is the point...

18:02.919 --> 18:05.786
I don't think the Russians
hacked Air Force One.

18:07.789 --> 18:11.093
Look, we have incontrovertible proof.

18:11.094 --> 18:12.127
Do you?

18:12.128 --> 18:13.995
On multiple fronts.

18:13.996 --> 18:15.430
Then explain this to me.

18:15.431 --> 18:17.132
If Russia hacked Air Force One,

18:17.133 --> 18:19.067
then they have the most
advanced cyber capabilities

18:19.068 --> 18:20.702
of any country on the planet.

18:20.703 --> 18:23.305
And what is their response

18:23.306 --> 18:26.208
to a counter-cyber attack
by the United States?

18:26.209 --> 18:29.843
They shut off the gas.

18:35.517 --> 18:37.352
You have more to go on than speculation?

18:37.353 --> 18:40.688
I mean, if we're gonna go
all the way with this...

18:42.257 --> 18:45.360
I have an asset,

18:45.361 --> 18:48.729
who works for a top advisor to Ostrov.

18:51.099 --> 18:54.202
If Russia didn't do this,

18:54.203 --> 18:56.605
if they're not behind it, then who?

18:56.606 --> 18:57.873
I don't know.

18:57.874 --> 18:59.040
Does it really matter?

18:59.041 --> 19:01.643
I have to present some plausible theory

19:01.644 --> 19:03.211
to get them off of this path...

19:03.212 --> 19:05.313
I haven't gotten that far.

19:05.314 --> 19:08.917
But, babe, I know this is a leap.

19:08.918 --> 19:13.387
And I know there's a chance that I'm wrong.

19:14.156 --> 19:17.992
But what if I'm not?

19:32.087 --> 19:33.686
_

19:33.811 --> 19:36.680
I need you guys to streamline

19:36.681 --> 19:38.749
whatever we have that directly links

19:38.750 --> 19:40.335
Lasko with the Russians.

19:40.336 --> 19:41.536
Primarily it's the money.

19:41.537 --> 19:44.576
An e-mail on his computer
from a Russian bank...

19:44.577 --> 19:47.586
one associated with GRU...
informing him of a wire transfer

19:47.587 --> 19:49.153
to his Cayman Islands bank account.

19:49.154 --> 19:52.890
Okay, it says here the NSA
was monitoring this bank

19:52.891 --> 19:54.158
for criminal activity.

19:54.159 --> 19:57.094
So where's the record of
a transfer from Russia?

19:57.095 --> 19:58.262
Uh...

19:58.263 --> 20:00.831
NSA has no corresponding
record of a wire transfer.

20:00.832 --> 20:02.266
But they're not perfect.

20:02.267 --> 20:06.003
It's, you know, often these
shady banks have multiple...

20:06.004 --> 20:08.105
If NSA has no record of a wire transfer,

20:08.106 --> 20:11.475
then how do we know that
the e-mail is legitimate?

20:11.476 --> 20:13.410
We traced its IP address
back to Moscow servers.

20:13.411 --> 20:14.745
IP addresses can be faked

20:14.746 --> 20:16.480
to look like they come from anywhere.

20:16.481 --> 20:18.982
Sure, but it's a convergence of evidence.

20:18.983 --> 20:22.319
Ma'am, the odds of all this
being counterfeit are very slim.

20:22.320 --> 20:24.922
It's like he says... "a
convergence of evidence."

20:24.923 --> 20:26.456
I heard him.

20:26.457 --> 20:29.326
And I'm gonna ask you
both to stop saying that.

20:29.327 --> 20:31.862
Because "convergence of evidence"

20:31.863 --> 20:33.263
is beginning to sound eerily

20:33.264 --> 20:37.166
like the new "weapons of mass destruction"

20:38.335 --> 20:41.038
So, Oliver, I'm gonna ask you again.

20:41.039 --> 20:42.372
On the eve of my telling

20:42.373 --> 20:45.175
the entire world that

20:45.176 --> 20:49.079
Russia is behind the greatest
cyber attack in human history,

20:49.080 --> 20:52.649
prompting actions which could lead us all

20:52.650 --> 20:57.254
into the greatest world
conflict in human history...

20:57.255 --> 21:01.562
there's a chance that all
the evidence we have here

21:01.563 --> 21:03.360
is fake?

21:03.361 --> 21:05.362
Yes, ma'am.

21:05.363 --> 21:07.797
There is a chance.

21:27.553 --> 21:28.788
It's a little long.

21:28.789 --> 21:30.523
I could definitely take some trims.

21:30.524 --> 21:34.271
I might've used, uh, JFK too many times.

21:34.272 --> 21:36.296
But I think it will get the point across.

21:36.297 --> 21:38.031
Madam Secretary, Russell Jackson's office

21:38.032 --> 21:40.566
is demanding to see a draft of the speech.

21:40.567 --> 21:43.136
He wants to vet it in time for changes.

21:43.137 --> 21:44.570
I'm sure he does.

21:44.571 --> 21:47.106
And, uh, you are scheduled to leave

21:47.107 --> 21:48.808
from the White House lawn in two hours.

21:48.809 --> 21:52.711
Four major networks cleared
time for a breaking news segment.

21:56.215 --> 21:59.018
I'm gonna, uh,

21:59.019 --> 22:01.354
take this little window of time.

22:01.355 --> 22:03.423
I'm just gonna say this.

22:03.424 --> 22:07.192
What if we're wrong?

22:08.194 --> 22:10.730
About what?

22:10.731 --> 22:13.032
Oh, I don't know.

22:13.033 --> 22:14.767
Everything. All of it.

22:14.768 --> 22:18.670
What if Russia wasn't behind
the Air Force One hack?

22:20.506 --> 22:22.608
Isn't it a little late
in the game for that?

22:22.609 --> 22:25.744
Oh, no. I-I think it's exactly
the right point in the game.

22:30.750 --> 22:32.352
It's, uh, fair to say

22:32.353 --> 22:36.923
that Russia is not an utter certainty,

22:36.924 --> 22:39.025
but nothing points to another actor.

22:39.026 --> 22:40.493
And given that, I think...

22:40.494 --> 22:43.029
clearly, the-the White House thinks...

22:43.030 --> 22:45.665
that we should proceed with what we know.

22:45.666 --> 22:48.401
How many messes

22:48.402 --> 22:50.737
have we gotten ourselves into

22:50.738 --> 22:52.839
with what we were

22:52.840 --> 22:54.307
almost sure we knew?

22:54.308 --> 22:58.010
I'm just asking for a
quick, exhaustive review.

22:58.011 --> 22:59.879
Let's just take a few minutes

22:59.880 --> 23:02.648
and consider the other possibilities.

23:02.649 --> 23:05.918
Okay, so let's... backtrack.

23:05.919 --> 23:08.488
We're reasonably sure that George Lasko

23:08.489 --> 23:10.223
was behind the hack of Air Force One.

23:10.224 --> 23:11.891
He had previous connections

23:11.892 --> 23:14.761
to Russia and China, North Korea and Iran.

23:14.762 --> 23:15.895
And now he's dead

23:15.896 --> 23:17.663
by way of polonium poisoning.

23:17.664 --> 23:19.832
I think we can rule out Iran.

23:19.833 --> 23:22.568
Our nuclear agreement closely monitors

23:22.569 --> 23:23.770
their radioactive material.

23:23.771 --> 23:25.104
We can rule out North Korea.

23:25.105 --> 23:26.773
Their nuclear capabilities

23:26.774 --> 23:28.841
are not sophisticated enough
to synthesize polonium.

23:28.842 --> 23:30.276
That leaves China,

23:30.277 --> 23:31.444
which makes some sense.

23:31.445 --> 23:33.346
How is that?

23:33.347 --> 23:34.647
With Russia and the U.S.

23:34.648 --> 23:36.516
locked in a slowly escalating conflict...

23:36.517 --> 23:37.950
Or quickly escalating.

23:37.951 --> 23:40.119
...China is free to shore up

23:40.120 --> 23:41.654
control over Southeast Asia.

23:41.655 --> 23:43.423
It's a long shot,

23:43.424 --> 23:45.625
but it might be worth looking into.

23:45.626 --> 23:47.126
Even though it would ruin my speech.

23:47.127 --> 23:48.928
You're saying China framed Russia

23:48.929 --> 23:50.129
for the Air Force One hack?

23:50.130 --> 23:51.130
I'm not saying.

23:51.131 --> 23:52.365
I'm just asking.

23:52.366 --> 23:54.567
Mr. Jackson's office

23:54.568 --> 23:55.935
is again asking for your speech.

23:55.936 --> 23:57.103
This time in all caps.

23:57.104 --> 23:58.805
He is officially shouting.

23:58.806 --> 24:01.240
Right.

24:01.241 --> 24:03.943
Tell him we're putting the
finishing touches on the speech.

24:03.944 --> 24:05.211
Yes, ma'am.

24:05.212 --> 24:06.746
If you'll excuse me,

24:06.747 --> 24:09.949
I obfuscate more effectively by phone.

24:09.950 --> 24:11.584
You will be the first to know.

24:11.585 --> 24:13.152
Okay.

24:13.153 --> 24:15.321
Good-bye.

24:15.322 --> 24:16.656
I hate to bother you.

24:16.657 --> 24:20.726
Yes, I read your first draft.

24:20.727 --> 24:23.161
You're really gonna make me ask?

24:24.730 --> 24:26.966
I think it's the finest piece of writing

24:26.967 --> 24:28.701
- I've ever seen from you.
- Really?

24:28.702 --> 24:32.203
No, I'm shining you on
because I hate to disappoint.

24:34.874 --> 24:36.409
It is good, isn't it?

24:36.410 --> 24:38.410
It's brilliant.

24:41.514 --> 24:44.150
- She's never gonna use it, is she?
- Matt...

24:44.151 --> 24:46.752
this speech was intended

24:46.753 --> 24:49.394
to rally the nations of the world

24:49.395 --> 24:53.092
into a potential war with Russia.

24:53.093 --> 24:55.595
If the secretary never reads it out loud,

24:55.596 --> 24:57.730
that would mean the best
of all possible outcomes

24:57.731 --> 24:59.332
had been achieved.

24:59.333 --> 25:00.666
Don't you agree?

25:00.667 --> 25:02.233
Of course.

25:04.670 --> 25:06.372
Minister Chen,

25:06.373 --> 25:09.408
thank you for coming
in on such short notice.

25:09.409 --> 25:11.677
I was surprised by the
urgent nature of the request.

25:11.678 --> 25:13.079
I'm aware that you are scheduled

25:13.080 --> 25:15.047
to appear before the UN in a few hours.

25:15.048 --> 25:16.883
Please, have a seat.

25:16.884 --> 25:19.018
Word is that you intend to address

25:19.019 --> 25:20.453
the recent events in Russia.

25:20.454 --> 25:21.420
Minister Chen,

25:21.421 --> 25:23.689
you-you recall a couple of months ago

25:23.690 --> 25:25.458
when the communications system

25:25.459 --> 25:26.859
on Air Force One was shut down?

25:26.860 --> 25:28.961
The result of solar flares, was it not?

25:28.962 --> 25:32.564
That was our best working
theory at the time, yes.

25:33.633 --> 25:35.067
But we have reason to believe

25:35.068 --> 25:37.970
there may be other factors involved.

25:37.971 --> 25:40.806
You mean someone hacked into the system?

25:40.807 --> 25:43.209
Possibly.

25:43.210 --> 25:44.810
I wanted to ask you

25:44.811 --> 25:47.547
about information that you might have

25:47.548 --> 25:51.117
about other actors who might have

25:51.118 --> 25:54.152
had reason to engage in such aggression.

25:55.688 --> 25:57.256
One of the things I've always valued

25:57.257 --> 25:58.658
about you, Madam Secretary,

25:58.659 --> 26:00.493
is that you tend to speak plainly.

26:00.494 --> 26:01.894
I urge you to do so now.

26:01.895 --> 26:04.230
Did you guys do it?

26:04.231 --> 26:05.531
Did China

26:05.532 --> 26:08.134
hire George Lasko, aka Dash,

26:08.135 --> 26:09.535
to hack Air Force One?

26:09.536 --> 26:10.870
You can't be serious.

26:10.871 --> 26:12.104
I assure you,

26:12.105 --> 26:14.240
I have never been more serious.

26:14.241 --> 26:17.376
And why would we do that?

26:17.377 --> 26:20.179
Engaging the U.S. and-and Russia

26:20.180 --> 26:23.015
in a costly military conflict

26:23.016 --> 26:25.151
would free China up to pursue

26:25.152 --> 26:27.353
a number of foreign interests.

26:27.354 --> 26:29.755
In the year 2000,

26:29.756 --> 26:33.092
China owned only six percent of
the United States' foreign debt.

26:33.093 --> 26:36.462
Now we own over 21%.

26:36.463 --> 26:39.231
We have over $1 trillion in U.S. securities

26:39.232 --> 26:42.602
and hundreds of billions
in Russian securities.

26:42.603 --> 26:44.737
If we pitted the two of
you against each other

26:44.738 --> 26:46.739
in a nuclear war,

26:46.740 --> 26:49.241
what good would that do
our investment portfolio?

26:49.242 --> 26:52.777
So you had nothing to
do with Air Force One?

26:54.080 --> 26:57.415
China is playing a long
game, Madam Secretary.

26:58.284 --> 26:59.518
When we come for you,

26:59.519 --> 27:03.055
it won't be with missiles
and cyber attacks.

27:03.056 --> 27:05.224
We'll repossess you.

27:06.839 --> 27:09.463
- I apologize, Madam Secretary.
- Thank you, Blake.

27:09.653 --> 27:10.251
_

27:10.252 --> 27:11.408
Grilling Oliver Shaw

27:11.409 --> 27:12.608
about the Air Force One hack

27:12.609 --> 27:13.783
in front of the Director

27:13.784 --> 27:16.111
- of National Intelligence?
- I wouldn't call it a grilling.

27:16.112 --> 27:17.813
And now I'm hearing about
some emergency meeting

27:17.814 --> 27:20.349
with Minister Chen about God knows what.

27:20.350 --> 27:22.484
Maybe we got different playbooks,

27:22.485 --> 27:24.186
but when appealing to the world

27:24.187 --> 27:25.621
to go to war with Russia,

27:25.622 --> 27:28.057
I think it's important
to get the facts straight.

27:28.058 --> 27:30.926
Your facts are about as
straight as they're gonna get.

27:30.927 --> 27:32.828
I hope to hell you're not
talking to Henry about this.

27:32.829 --> 27:34.597
What does Henry have to do with anything?

27:34.598 --> 27:38.133
He came to me, babbling
about some half-cocked theory.

27:38.134 --> 27:41.136
Well, that's between you and Henry.

27:41.137 --> 27:43.472
I have serious questions.

27:43.473 --> 27:45.641
And I am telling you that you don't.

27:45.642 --> 27:47.943
Marine One is out there
on the lawn right now,

27:47.944 --> 27:49.845
Air Force One is ready at Andrews,

27:49.846 --> 27:51.680
ready to take you to the UN

27:51.681 --> 27:54.350
to make a speech you insisted
on giving not 24 hours ago.

27:54.351 --> 27:58.821
If I make this speech and we're wrong,

27:58.822 --> 28:02.992
it could destroy the U.S.'s
credibility for decades.

28:02.993 --> 28:06.161
If I miss the speech, Russell,

28:06.162 --> 28:08.730
it's barely a footnote in history.

28:11.667 --> 28:15.170
I am telling you to get on Marine One.

28:15.171 --> 28:17.405
The president's waiting.

28:31.687 --> 28:33.855
Aren't you supposed to
be at the UN right now?

28:35.090 --> 28:37.925
Henry, you'd better be right about this.

29:01.797 --> 29:03.332
_

29:05.076 --> 29:06.489
_

29:07.681 --> 29:08.649
_

29:10.716 --> 29:11.972
_

29:12.591 --> 29:14.014
_

29:14.544 --> 29:15.956
_

29:16.909 --> 29:18.175
Jeffrey, when I say

29:18.176 --> 29:20.105
the secretary won't be
addressing this matter

29:20.106 --> 29:22.907
in the press today, that is
exactly what I mean by that.

29:22.908 --> 29:24.675
Obviously, she had a reason

29:24.676 --> 29:27.011
for canceling her appearance at the UN.

29:27.012 --> 29:29.313
Look, I'm not saying it's
related to national security.

29:29.314 --> 29:30.748
You are. And if you print it,

29:30.749 --> 29:33.116
you'd better have your
attorney on speed dial.

29:34.285 --> 29:35.319
Wow.

29:35.320 --> 29:36.454
You're getting good at that.

29:36.455 --> 29:37.989
I'm getting a lot of practice today.

29:37.990 --> 29:39.957
Look, if we just release a statement,

29:39.958 --> 29:41.359
the press will calm down.

29:41.360 --> 29:42.860
Anything we feed them

29:42.861 --> 29:44.762
is going to make them hungrier.

29:44.763 --> 29:45.696
Let's wait

29:45.697 --> 29:47.865
until we have something to say.

29:47.866 --> 29:50.167
Like, for example, I've been fired.

29:50.168 --> 29:52.370
Mr. Jackson's office has been

29:52.371 --> 29:54.138
eerily quiet.

29:54.139 --> 29:56.140
Yes, and it's speaking volumes.

29:56.141 --> 29:57.641
What's it saying, exactly?

29:58.643 --> 30:00.545
The White House

30:00.546 --> 30:02.213
doesn't want to look unstable

30:02.214 --> 30:03.881
in the middle of a crisis.

30:03.882 --> 30:05.950
They'll deal with me later.

30:05.951 --> 30:08.619
...announcing our renewed partnership

30:08.620 --> 30:10.154
with the people of Ukraine.

30:10.155 --> 30:14.625
Today, we are drawing a line in the sand.

30:14.626 --> 30:16.627
Because when it comes
to the cause of freedom,

30:16.628 --> 30:18.563
we are all Ukrainians.

30:18.564 --> 30:20.998
My speech was so much better.

30:23.707 --> 30:26.637
Well, in order to facilitate
avoiding the press,

30:26.638 --> 30:29.740
I'm officially making myself unavailable.

30:29.741 --> 30:32.076
I have a football game to get to.

30:32.077 --> 30:33.210
And when I get back,

30:33.211 --> 30:34.879
let's figure out what I'm going to say

30:34.880 --> 30:37.881
about not having anything to say to the UN.

30:42.687 --> 30:43.953
What?

30:45.923 --> 30:48.659
I don't know.

30:48.660 --> 30:50.828
It's kind of bizarre.

30:50.829 --> 30:53.129
Then it ought to feel right at home.

30:55.066 --> 30:56.366
What?

30:58.302 --> 31:01.706
When Bozek came to D.C. a month ago,

31:01.707 --> 31:04.075
he was on his knees

31:04.076 --> 31:05.876
begging for NATO membership.

31:05.877 --> 31:07.778
Now look at him: at the White House,

31:07.779 --> 31:10.348
with the President of the United States

31:10.349 --> 31:13.283
doing everything but making a blood pact?

31:15.486 --> 31:17.787
He's getting more than he wanted.

31:19.190 --> 31:21.491
He is, isn't he?

31:22.460 --> 31:24.728
I'm saying it's weird.

31:26.030 --> 31:28.432
What are you saying?

31:28.433 --> 31:31.702
The man had to jump out of his own plane.

31:31.703 --> 31:33.371
That's insane, right?

31:33.372 --> 31:35.573
Right.

31:35.574 --> 31:37.608
Pull the staff together.

31:37.609 --> 31:39.343
Find out everything you can

31:39.344 --> 31:42.046
about the incident on Bozek's plane.

31:42.047 --> 31:44.682
Quietly.

31:44.683 --> 31:46.017
And if word gets out,

31:46.018 --> 31:47.685
I'll swear you all went rogue.

31:47.686 --> 31:49.720
Yes, ma'am.

31:54.525 --> 31:55.626
Come on, Panthers! Let's go!

31:55.627 --> 31:57.528
Hold 'em! You got this!

31:57.529 --> 31:59.497
Tackled by number 46...

31:59.498 --> 32:01.065
I don't know what I was worried about.

32:01.066 --> 32:02.166
I mean, he's doing great.

32:02.167 --> 32:04.035
He's missed every tackle.

32:04.036 --> 32:06.370
That's what I'm talking about.

32:06.371 --> 32:07.738
He's doing the bare minimum.

32:07.739 --> 32:10.340
Babe, I think he's playing
at the top of his game.

32:12.209 --> 32:13.477
Well, even better.

32:13.478 --> 32:15.613
Those big guys are just brushing by him.

32:15.614 --> 32:17.814
Works for me.

32:18.983 --> 32:22.186
So is it a totally crazy idea

32:22.187 --> 32:25.856
that the Ukrainians
hacked into Air Force One,

32:25.857 --> 32:28.359
pinned it on the Russians,
and then orchestrated

32:28.360 --> 32:30.394
their own plane crash
to cover their tracks?

32:30.395 --> 32:32.096
Why?

32:32.097 --> 32:34.799
Because I need to know just how crazy it is

32:34.800 --> 32:36.400
before I go down this road.

32:36.401 --> 32:37.401
No, I mean,

32:37.402 --> 32:38.636
why would they do that?

32:38.637 --> 32:41.038
How do you get the President
of the United States

32:41.039 --> 32:43.340
to commit to taking on Russia?

32:43.341 --> 32:46.644
Make him think that he
was attacked by them.

32:46.645 --> 32:49.313
Then he'll never allow

32:49.314 --> 32:51.282
for any kind of aggression against Ukraine.

32:51.283 --> 32:52.583
That's a huge swing.

32:52.584 --> 32:55.119
Desperate times, desperate measures.

32:56.288 --> 32:57.655
45. Third down.

32:57.656 --> 33:00.224
So... is it nuts?

33:00.225 --> 33:01.492
Is it possible?

33:01.493 --> 33:04.395
How long did it take the passengers to jump

33:04.396 --> 33:06.163
after the plane got in trouble?

33:06.164 --> 33:08.666
According to the black box,

33:08.667 --> 33:09.800
uh, 48 seconds.

33:09.801 --> 33:11.401
Were there any fatalities?

33:12.937 --> 33:14.371
And how banged up were they?

33:14.372 --> 33:17.408
The report gave no indication

33:17.409 --> 33:19.276
that any of the passengers were injured.

33:19.277 --> 33:21.479
Well, that's interesting.

33:21.480 --> 33:23.748
When I was doing parachute training,

33:23.749 --> 33:26.283
everybody always had something
on their first couple of jumps.

33:26.284 --> 33:27.284
Cuts, bruises,

33:27.285 --> 33:28.853
sprains, even a couple of fractures.

33:28.854 --> 33:30.221
And this was a bunch of Marines

33:30.222 --> 33:31.555
in top physical condition

33:31.556 --> 33:32.823
jumping out of a stable plane.

33:32.824 --> 33:35.024
Not a bunch of diplomats
bailing from a nosedive.

33:42.367 --> 33:44.367
Nice hit, Jace!

33:48.105 --> 33:50.174
Great play, Panthers!

33:50.175 --> 33:53.109
They stopped a potential touchdown drive.

33:57.815 --> 33:59.316
- Hi.
- What do you want?

33:59.317 --> 34:00.985
I need your help.

34:00.986 --> 34:03.154
I'll ask you again.

34:03.155 --> 34:04.655
What do you want?

34:04.656 --> 34:06.957
You went to Ukraine

34:06.958 --> 34:08.626
to meet with Bozek and his staff

34:08.627 --> 34:11.228
directly after the incident
with their plane, right?

34:11.228 --> 34:12.996
The day after. Yes.

34:12.998 --> 34:15.565
What kind of physical shape were they in?

34:15.567 --> 34:17.734
Fine.

34:19.003 --> 34:21.338
Cuts, sprains, bruises?

34:21.339 --> 34:22.505
Any kind of injuries?

34:22.507 --> 34:24.341
Bozek had a small laceration

34:24.342 --> 34:25.509
on the side of his face.

34:25.510 --> 34:27.143
Otherwise, not a mark on them that I saw

34:27.145 --> 34:28.344
or that anyone mentioned.

34:28.346 --> 34:30.214
Huh.

34:30.215 --> 34:31.415
You're not doubting

34:31.416 --> 34:32.616
that the crash happened?

34:32.617 --> 34:34.451
There's documentation.

34:34.452 --> 34:35.753
They found the wreckage.

34:35.754 --> 34:37.688
- I'm not doubting that.
- Then what?

34:37.688 --> 34:39.857
You didn't come all the way over here

34:39.858 --> 34:41.792
to ask me how they looked.

34:41.793 --> 34:43.928
Actually, I did.

34:43.929 --> 34:46.596
Thanks, Craig.

34:47.965 --> 34:51.569
I know you have a
wrathful grudge against me

34:51.570 --> 34:53.270
that you might well take to your grave

34:53.271 --> 34:55.135
and we are never going to see eye to eye

34:55.136 --> 34:56.650
about what transpired,

34:56.942 --> 34:59.643
but I do know one thing about you.

34:59.644 --> 35:01.545
First and foremost, you're a patriot.

35:01.546 --> 35:03.980
I really do wish you well.

35:14.058 --> 35:15.993
Wow.

35:15.994 --> 35:18.095
You guys look like you've
been here all night.

35:18.096 --> 35:19.663
Well, because they've been here all night.

35:19.664 --> 35:22.166
I was going for sarcasm.

35:22.167 --> 35:23.133
Oh, sorry.

35:23.134 --> 35:24.427
I've been here all night, too.

35:24.428 --> 35:25.803
So what have we got?

35:25.804 --> 35:28.072
Matt has a friend in Defense.

35:28.073 --> 35:29.340
Matt has a friend?

35:29.341 --> 35:31.041
In the Defense Department.

35:31.042 --> 35:32.576
None of my jokes are landing.

35:32.577 --> 35:34.678
Must be the sleep deprivation.

35:34.679 --> 35:36.121
So my friend in Defense

35:36.122 --> 35:38.782
somehow got his hands on the manifest

35:38.783 --> 35:41.117
for that Ukrainian flight.

35:42.453 --> 35:43.988
Both versions.

35:43.989 --> 35:44.955
Both?

35:44.956 --> 35:46.156
Two days before the flight,

35:46.157 --> 35:48.792
the entire passenger roster list changed.

35:48.793 --> 35:51.379
The original list was just
his usual inner sanctum.

35:51.380 --> 35:53.364
But suddenly, the guest list changed

35:53.365 --> 35:54.632
to include seemingly random

35:54.633 --> 35:56.000
members of his staff.

35:56.001 --> 35:57.201
"Seemingly."

35:57.202 --> 35:58.569
What's the connective tissue?

35:58.570 --> 36:00.271
Everyone on board the plane,

36:00.272 --> 36:01.405
including Bozek,

36:01.406 --> 36:03.307
was a former officer in the Ukrainian Army.

36:03.308 --> 36:04.441
All with hundreds of hours

36:04.442 --> 36:07.111
of paratroop training and experience.

36:08.914 --> 36:11.115
Wow.

36:11.116 --> 36:12.283
What are the odds?

36:12.284 --> 36:13.651
There are no odds.

36:13.652 --> 36:14.985
Ma'am.

36:14.986 --> 36:16.287
We're just getting a report

36:16.288 --> 36:18.989
that a man has died in
a Vietnamese hospital

36:18.990 --> 36:20.157
of polonium poisoning.

36:20.158 --> 36:21.625
What?

36:21.626 --> 36:26.096
The, uh, alpha particle
signature off his body

36:26.097 --> 36:28.532
indicates that it's polonium-210.

36:28.533 --> 36:32.803
That's the same kind that
was used to kill George Lasko.

36:32.804 --> 36:34.171
Where was this man from?

36:34.172 --> 36:36.674
Ukraine.

36:36.675 --> 36:38.475
Specifically, an agent

36:38.476 --> 36:41.011
with their Foreign Intelligence Service.

36:41.012 --> 36:44.014
A man named Sasha Marchuk.

36:44.015 --> 36:47.651
He spent two days trying to
secure a flight out of Cambodia,

36:47.652 --> 36:51.388
but was denied because of his
grave and indeterminate illness.

36:51.389 --> 36:55.125
He finally staggered into
a hospital in Biên Hoa

36:55.126 --> 36:56.260
where he admitted

36:56.261 --> 36:58.362
that he was suffering
from polonium poisoning.

36:58.363 --> 37:00.431
By then, it was too late.

37:00.432 --> 37:02.800
He died of liver failure
just a few hours ago.

37:02.801 --> 37:04.535
I don't understand.

37:04.536 --> 37:05.703
Who is he?

37:05.704 --> 37:07.338
He's the person

37:07.339 --> 37:08.806
who hired the hacker,

37:08.807 --> 37:10.107
George Lasko,

37:10.108 --> 37:11.909
and then killed him

37:11.910 --> 37:13.444
to cover the tracks.

37:13.445 --> 37:15.312
But polonium is a tricky murder weapon

37:15.313 --> 37:17.881
and he accidentally poisoned himself.

37:17.882 --> 37:19.984
You're saying the Ukrainians

37:19.985 --> 37:21.385
were behind the cyber attack

37:21.386 --> 37:22.720
on Air Force One.

37:22.721 --> 37:24.188
What would they possibly have to gain?

37:24.189 --> 37:26.590
President Bozek was panicked
about Russian aggression

37:26.591 --> 37:28.859
and he knew Ukraine could
never stand up to them

37:28.860 --> 37:30.127
without international aid.

37:30.128 --> 37:32.629
So he decided to take
matters into his own hands.

37:32.630 --> 37:35.432
He sought out Lasko and
gave him countless resources

37:35.433 --> 37:38.168
to develop his malware
and hack Air Force One.

37:38.169 --> 37:40.671
He figured we'd blame Russia

37:40.672 --> 37:42.406
and get pulled into the conflict.

37:42.407 --> 37:43.941
But when we didn't take the bait,

37:43.942 --> 37:46.210
he followed up with an appeal to join NATO.

37:46.211 --> 37:48.645
His request was denied,

37:48.646 --> 37:50.748
so he escalated the ruse.

37:50.749 --> 37:52.716
He uploaded fake financial records

37:52.717 --> 37:54.485
onto Lasko's laptop,

37:54.486 --> 37:57.321
transactions pointing back to Russian GRU.

37:57.322 --> 37:58.922
And then he attacked his own plane?

37:58.923 --> 38:00.290
Yes, sir.

38:00.291 --> 38:03.861
He covered for the lives of the passengers

38:03.862 --> 38:07.164
by replacing officials

38:07.165 --> 38:09.432
with trained paratroopers.

38:11.235 --> 38:13.070
That was the final piece of the puzzle.

38:13.071 --> 38:14.571
We just found it.

38:14.572 --> 38:16.739
It wasn't Russia.

38:18.042 --> 38:20.411
We were duped, Mr. President.

38:20.412 --> 38:23.079
It was Bozek all along.

38:34.913 --> 38:36.255
Mr. President,

38:36.256 --> 38:39.080
I could not be more at a loss.

38:39.081 --> 38:42.115
Mikhail, believe me when I tell you

38:42.116 --> 38:43.817
this will go much better for you

38:43.818 --> 38:45.784
if you dispense with this approach.

38:51.758 --> 38:54.361
My parents and grandparents

38:54.362 --> 38:58.365
suffered countless horrors
at the hands of the Russians.

38:58.366 --> 39:01.234
I was not going to let
Ukraine be swallowed up

39:01.235 --> 39:03.169
by the Russian monster once again.

39:03.170 --> 39:05.505
I resolved to do

39:05.506 --> 39:06.673
everything in my power,

39:06.674 --> 39:08.308
from risking my life

39:08.309 --> 39:09.776
to risking yours, Mr. President,

39:09.777 --> 39:13.446
to preserve my country's independence.

39:13.447 --> 39:14.981
I would do it again.

39:14.982 --> 39:17.684
Well, luckily for you,

39:17.685 --> 39:19.653
this scheme of yours

39:19.654 --> 39:21.987
has put us all in the same box.

39:23.823 --> 39:26.826
If we reveal the deception,

39:26.827 --> 39:28.928
Russia will hit you
with everything it's got,

39:28.929 --> 39:31.463
killing millions of innocent people.

39:32.666 --> 39:34.567
And a wordless pulling out of troops

39:34.568 --> 39:36.469
makes us look weak,

39:36.470 --> 39:38.838
exposing you to the same outcome.

39:38.839 --> 39:41.474
So, for the time being,

39:41.475 --> 39:44.611
we are maintaining our presence

39:44.612 --> 39:47.681
and enforcing our no-fly
zone over Ukrainian airspace.

39:47.682 --> 39:50.250
40 million Ukrainians

39:50.251 --> 39:51.751
don't deserve to get slaughtered

39:51.752 --> 39:53.952
because of what you did.

39:56.122 --> 39:58.525
Thank you.

39:58.526 --> 40:02.127
And my people thank you
for your great mercy.

40:04.297 --> 40:05.932
Let's be clear.

40:05.933 --> 40:09.803
If you breathe one word of this to anyone,

40:09.804 --> 40:12.972
we will expose you, capture you,

40:12.973 --> 40:15.275
and throw you into the same dark hole

40:15.276 --> 40:17.075
where we kept Noriega.

40:21.915 --> 40:23.950
Dude, he was coming across the line

40:23.951 --> 40:25.452
like Beast Mode with a jet pack.

40:25.453 --> 40:26.619
You came out of nowhere, dude.

40:26.620 --> 40:28.054
He was dragging you and
trying to shake you off,

40:28.055 --> 40:29.222
but you wouldn't budge.

40:29.223 --> 40:31.224
Then he just tried to
fling you and he was down.

40:31.225 --> 40:32.759
Boom! I thought there was gonna be

40:32.760 --> 40:33.960
nothing but a grease spot.

40:33.961 --> 40:35.527
The Secretary of State.

40:36.429 --> 40:37.864
Oh, hey, Mom. The, uh...

40:37.865 --> 40:39.032
the guys brought pizza.

40:39.033 --> 40:40.900
I know, it... it smells so good.

40:40.901 --> 40:42.268
Don't let me interrupt.

40:42.269 --> 40:44.537
- Your son is one crazy-ass
ball player, ma'am. - Dude!

40:44.538 --> 40:46.706
Yeah, I know.

40:46.707 --> 40:49.109
And now he's out for the season.

40:49.110 --> 40:50.276
It's so sad.

40:50.277 --> 40:51.311
She's not sad.

40:51.312 --> 40:53.546
Not the least bit sad.

40:53.547 --> 40:55.215
But I'm glad you had a good game.

40:55.216 --> 40:57.462
Dude, you're totally coming back next year.

40:57.463 --> 40:59.339
Oh, you know it, dude.

41:00.488 --> 41:04.428
Our son has a whole new
group of friends named Dude.

41:09.600 --> 41:11.702
They named him MVP of the game.

41:11.703 --> 41:13.004
Giving him a trophy.

41:13.005 --> 41:15.636
Wow. And I don't have to worry about him

41:15.637 --> 41:17.070
for a whole nother season.

41:17.071 --> 41:19.272
Oh, forget it.

41:19.273 --> 41:21.240
He's already told me
he's retiring his jersey.

41:21.241 --> 41:23.576
What?

41:23.577 --> 41:25.611
He's talking about fencing now.

41:25.612 --> 41:28.114
Swords.

41:28.115 --> 41:30.583
Fabulous.

41:34.921 --> 41:36.856
Thank you for talking to me about things

41:36.857 --> 41:38.391
that could have sent us to prison.

41:38.392 --> 41:40.193
So you followed through on your theory?

41:40.194 --> 41:42.061
Oh, yes.

41:42.062 --> 41:44.831
All the way to the president's office.

41:44.832 --> 41:47.867
World catastrophe avoided.

41:47.868 --> 41:50.469
Still have to find a way

41:50.470 --> 41:52.572
to extricate the U.S. from Ukraine

41:52.573 --> 41:54.407
without losing any more lives.

41:54.408 --> 41:57.343
Otherwise, they'll just
keep banging the drum

41:57.344 --> 41:59.344
until someone fires a shot.

42:00.546 --> 42:01.846
My asset's gone dark.

42:02.949 --> 42:05.284
I don't know if he got
trapped in the blackout

42:05.285 --> 42:07.486
or he fled to Stockholm in time.

42:07.487 --> 42:08.521
I-I have no idea.

42:08.522 --> 42:10.722
Henry, I'm sorry.

42:15.461 --> 42:17.129
Why is Jason quitting football?

42:17.130 --> 42:18.264
Is it because of me?

42:18.265 --> 42:19.866
Because if he's really good at it,

42:19.867 --> 42:21.868
then he should do it, even if it scares me.

42:21.869 --> 42:24.437
Uh, no, he's quitting
because it scares him.

42:24.438 --> 42:26.405
Believe me, he has nothing
more to prove there.

42:30.610 --> 42:32.344
Hello, Mr. President.

42:35.248 --> 42:36.849
Yes, sir.

42:36.850 --> 42:38.483
I'm on my way.

42:43.923 --> 42:45.758
You're a praying man, right?

42:45.759 --> 42:47.625
I'll get St. Francis on it. He owes me.

42:54.868 --> 42:57.637
There's a development
over Ukrainian airspace.

42:57.638 --> 42:59.872
The Russians just
violated the no-fly zone.

42:59.873 --> 43:01.040
Half an hour ago.

43:01.041 --> 43:02.474
What does Ostrov say?

43:02.475 --> 43:03.976
Nothing at all out of Moscow.

43:03.977 --> 43:05.378
They're not picking up the phone.

43:05.379 --> 43:06.979
The message is clear.

43:06.980 --> 43:09.282
They're not recognizing our authority.

43:09.283 --> 43:10.950
It's their show.

43:10.951 --> 43:12.385
Then we have to be equally clear.

43:12.386 --> 43:14.986
Our men are locked and
loaded, Mr. President.

43:18.557 --> 43:21.659
Just waiting for the order.

43:27.533 --> 43:29.534
Permission to engage, sir?

43:36.154 --> 43:38.095
Permission granted.

43:38.096 --> 43:44.862
