00:15.200 --> 00:16.600
Hi there.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.934
Today we're going
to find out about clouds.

00:18.934 --> 00:20.700
Yes.
Fluffy ones like this

00:20.700 --> 00:22.400
are cumulus clouds.

00:22.400 --> 00:23.834
- Interesting, Bert.
And the wispy ones?
- Yeah!

00:23.834 --> 00:26.266
Oh, those are cirrus clouds,
Ernie.

00:26.266 --> 00:29.200
And that dark one
is called a cumulonimbus.

00:29.200 --> 00:30.567
Gee, Bert!

00:30.567 --> 00:32.533
Look at all the rain
coming out of it, Bert.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.333
Mmm? I don't see
any rain, Ernie.

00:34.333 --> 00:35.734
- Look closer.

00:38.500 --> 00:40.000
Hee hee hee hee!

00:40.000 --> 00:42.600
Watch for more clouds today
on "Sesame Street."

00:45.233 --> 00:48.000

01:15.266 --> 01:19.333
Chris:
OK. Let's see. Here, and...

01:19.333 --> 01:21.600
how's that?

01:21.600 --> 01:23.700
Good? Excellent. All right.
Good, good, good.

01:23.700 --> 01:26.033
Oh! Hey, welcome
to Sesame Street.

01:26.033 --> 01:27.533
Boy, talk about sunny days.

01:27.533 --> 01:30.367
Today is a scorcher!
It's really hot outside.

01:30.367 --> 01:33.200
Mr. Johnson: Hey, Chris!
Where's my salad?

01:33.200 --> 01:35.033
Coming right up,
Mr. Johnson.

01:35.033 --> 01:37.633
Ohh.

01:37.633 --> 01:42.100
...over there. Oh, and this
right here is Hooper's Store.

01:42.100 --> 01:44.867
Oh, they make
the best smoothies here.

01:44.867 --> 01:47.233
- Oh, it's wonderful!
- Yeah.

01:47.233 --> 01:49.233
Ha ha ha!
Oh, hiya, Chris.

01:49.233 --> 01:51.266
Hey, Elmo.
Who's your friend?

01:51.266 --> 01:53.734
Oh, this is
Elmo's friend, Floatie.

01:53.734 --> 01:55.166
- She's a cloud.
- Mm-hmm.

01:55.166 --> 01:56.767
- Uh-huh.

01:56.767 --> 01:58.500
But shouldn't you
be up in the sky?

01:58.500 --> 02:00.166
- I want to find a job.
- Yeah.

02:00.166 --> 02:03.433
- Coming, Mr. Johnson.

02:03.433 --> 02:04.967
- Ha ha!
- Hey, I have to go,

02:04.967 --> 02:06.600
but, hey, welcome
to Sesame Street.

02:06.600 --> 02:08.100
- Oh, thank you.
- See you later, Chris.

02:08.100 --> 02:09.600
- Ha ha ha!
- Yeah.

02:09.600 --> 02:12.266
What kind of job would
Floatie like to have?

02:12.266 --> 02:15.433
Mmm. Well,
I'm not sure, Elmo,

02:15.433 --> 02:18.133
but I am sure that I want
to help people.

02:18.133 --> 02:21.333
- Did I hear someone say--
- All: Ohh!

02:21.333 --> 02:24.600
No,
Elmo didn't say, "Ohh!"

02:24.600 --> 02:26.767
- Yeah, neither did I.
- I'm so sorry.

02:26.767 --> 02:29.400
It's very slippery here.
Lots of water, for some reason.

02:29.400 --> 02:31.767
Oh.
Well, that's my fault.

02:31.767 --> 02:34.967
I'm just so excited
to be here on Sesame Street,

02:34.967 --> 02:37.900
I, uh--ha ha!-- I guess
I rained a little.

02:37.900 --> 02:40.166
I'm sorry.
You rain?

02:40.166 --> 02:42.867
- Well, yeah.
- Rain comes from clouds.

02:42.867 --> 02:45.567
- That's right, Elmo.

02:45.567 --> 02:48.300
When the rain comes down
from the sky,

02:48.300 --> 02:50.667
it comes from clouds like me.

02:50.667 --> 02:52.300
Well, that certainly
explains all the bubbles.

02:52.300 --> 02:53.934
- Yeah.
- At any rate,
did I hear you say

02:53.934 --> 02:54.934
you wanted a job?

02:54.934 --> 02:56.633
Oh! I do!

02:56.633 --> 02:58.333
Well, then look no more.

02:58.333 --> 03:02.467
I, Grover Monster, know about
all the jobs on Sesame Street.

03:02.467 --> 03:03.934
I have to.
I've had 'em all.

03:03.934 --> 03:06.900
Oh, ho ho! So Grover can
really help Floatie?

03:06.900 --> 03:08.400
Of course! Follow me!

03:08.400 --> 03:10.767
- Oh, ho ho!
- Whoa! Oh!

03:10.767 --> 03:12.133
Watch the puddles.

03:12.133 --> 03:14.200
Right.
Ha ha ha.

03:14.200 --> 03:16.600
- Come on, Floatie,
let's go.
- Ohh!

03:16.600 --> 03:18.734
I know the perfect job
for someone

03:18.734 --> 03:20.700
so white and fluffy and puffy.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.834
- OK, OK.

03:22.834 --> 03:24.133
I will give you a hint.

03:24.133 --> 03:27.367
It involves hopping
and skipping through fields,

03:27.367 --> 03:29.967
taking part in nursery rhymes
and fairy tales,

03:29.967 --> 03:32.500
and helping people
to go to sleep.

03:32.500 --> 03:34.834
Oh! Oh, oh, oh, oh!
A sheep!

03:34.834 --> 03:37.033
Correct! Yes!
That is right!

03:37.033 --> 03:38.467
Ha ha ha!

03:38.467 --> 03:39.700
I mean, are you sure?

03:39.700 --> 03:40.867
Yeah.

03:40.867 --> 03:43.533
We'll call you, OK?

03:43.533 --> 03:45.767
All right. Oh.

03:45.767 --> 03:47.500
Ne-e-e-ext.

03:47.500 --> 03:49.166
Oh, that is us.
Come on now.

03:49.166 --> 03:50.934
Sit yourself down.
Do not be nervous.

03:50.934 --> 03:52.800
Um, uh, Floatie,

03:52.800 --> 03:56.934
do you have any experience at
being part of a flock of sheep?

03:56.934 --> 03:58.667
Does she have
experience?

03:58.667 --> 04:00.233
Does she have experience?

04:00.233 --> 04:01.667
Do you have experience?

04:01.667 --> 04:03.000
Well, not really.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.734
I've never really been
with a group of sheep.

04:05.734 --> 04:09.467
I've mostly just gone
where the wind takes me.

04:09.467 --> 04:13.700
Drifted around, huh?
All right. No permanent address.

04:13.700 --> 04:15.800
But she is here now,
and she will make

04:15.800 --> 04:18.033
a wonderful addition
to any flock of sheep.

04:18.033 --> 04:19.200
Say, "Baa."

04:21.967 --> 04:24.633
- Pretty good.
- Aha! Silly me!

04:24.633 --> 04:26.834
For a moment, I thought
you two switched places.

04:26.834 --> 04:29.200
You sounded so much alike.
Ha ha ha ha!

04:29.200 --> 04:31.633
Well, I will admit,

04:31.633 --> 04:33.734
you look like a sheep, Floatie,

04:33.734 --> 04:36.133
but, uh, do you have wool?

04:36.133 --> 04:37.800
Wool?

04:37.800 --> 04:40.333
Yeah. You know, wool,
like this.

04:40.333 --> 04:42.133
You know, sheep have wool.

04:42.133 --> 04:44.800
That's what people use
to make socks and sweaters.

04:44.800 --> 04:49.467
Well, clouds do look wooly,
but actually we're water.

04:49.467 --> 04:52.133
It's true. I'm made up
of thousands

04:52.133 --> 04:54.700
of tiny drops of water
floating in air.

04:54.700 --> 04:57.533
- Mm-hmm.

04:57.533 --> 05:00.033
- That is fascinating.

05:00.033 --> 05:02.533
- Uh, no.
- Ahhh!

05:02.533 --> 05:05.467
I'm afraid I'm looking
for an actual sheep.

05:05.467 --> 05:08.700
You know, one who gives
wool and all. Sorry.

05:08.700 --> 05:11.800
Oh, boy. Come on.
Let's go, guys.

05:11.800 --> 05:14.767
- It's OK. It's OK.
- Oh. You're not looking for
furry red monsters, are you?

05:14.767 --> 05:16.066
- No. Sorry.
- Have a good day.

05:16.066 --> 05:18.934
Well, that
didn't go very well.

05:18.934 --> 05:22.500
Oh, Floatie,
don't worry.

05:22.500 --> 05:24.834
You know, Elmo tries
lots of things,

05:24.834 --> 05:27.567
but they don't always work
the first time.

05:27.567 --> 05:29.300
Or the 15th.

05:29.300 --> 05:32.100
Floatie just needs
to keep trying.

05:32.100 --> 05:34.100
Yeah, yeah,
and what is more,

05:34.100 --> 05:36.800
I have an even better job
in mind for you!

05:36.800 --> 05:38.333
- Come on!

05:38.333 --> 05:40.667
Oh, ne-e-ext.

05:40.667 --> 05:43.400
Yeah!
Ha ha ha-- Whoa! Ooh!

05:43.400 --> 05:46.100
Ha ha ha ha! Hmm?

05:46.100 --> 05:48.834
- You are hired.
- Oh, hee hee hee hee!

05:48.834 --> 05:52.133
Oh, now you're
very helpful, Floatie,

05:52.133 --> 05:55.533
and I would love to hire you
to work here, but, uh--

05:55.533 --> 05:58.800
My laundry does smell
like springtime rain,

05:58.800 --> 06:01.133
but it's still damp.

06:01.133 --> 06:04.000
Oh, now, don't you fret
your pretty little face,

06:04.000 --> 06:05.300
Mrs. Crustworthy.

06:05.300 --> 06:08.000
We'll get everything
nice and dry for you.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.133
- Oh, I should hope so.
- Oh, this is my fault.

06:10.133 --> 06:13.367
I should not have tried
to fold laundry.

06:13.367 --> 06:15.500
Oh, not at all,
not at all.

06:15.500 --> 06:18.533
Well, yeah, sort of a little.
You see the problem?

06:18.533 --> 06:22.900
The customers want their laundry
to come back nice and dry.

06:22.900 --> 06:25.867
Yeah, but since clouds
are made of water, I made...

06:25.867 --> 06:28.266
Both: ...everything wet.
- Yeah, well...

06:28.266 --> 06:30.800
Oh, well, it's OK.
Floatie tried.

06:30.800 --> 06:33.467
Do not worry.
I, Grover, have just thought

06:33.467 --> 06:36.266
of the perfect job for you.
Follow me!

06:36.266 --> 06:39.467
Aha, dessert. Ha!
Wait a minute.

06:39.467 --> 06:42.467
What is this, Chris, soup?

06:42.467 --> 06:44.100
Uh, no,
that's your ice cream.

06:44.100 --> 06:46.667
Why did you bring me
melted ice cream, Chris?

06:46.667 --> 06:49.367
I didn't mean to.
It's just so hot and sunny.

06:49.367 --> 06:51.300
Ohh. You can
say that again.

06:51.300 --> 06:53.500
But hey, don't worry.
I'll get you a fresh bowl, OK?

06:53.500 --> 06:54.834
- Oh, please do.
- All right.

06:54.834 --> 06:56.734
Yeah, we could really use
some shade around here.

06:56.734 --> 06:58.700
- Yeah.
- Ha ha ha ha!

06:58.700 --> 07:00.734
We'll just
buckle this here, and...

07:00.734 --> 07:01.867
- Yeah.
- There!

07:01.867 --> 07:05.266
What am I wearing?

07:05.266 --> 07:07.500
You, my friend,
are wearing the uniform

07:07.500 --> 07:10.166
of a most important
and helpful person--

07:10.166 --> 07:11.967
a crossing guard.

07:11.967 --> 07:13.033
That's right.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.867
A crossing guard
is somebody

07:14.867 --> 07:17.200
who helps people
cross the street.

07:17.200 --> 07:19.633
- Here comes somebody now!
- Right this way.

07:19.633 --> 07:21.333
Follow the crossing guard.

07:21.333 --> 07:24.667
Floatie:
Oh! Whoa! Whoa!

07:24.667 --> 07:26.166
Where's Floatie going?

07:26.166 --> 07:28.600
Whoa! I can't help it!
It's the wind!

07:28.600 --> 07:30.166
- Well,

07:30.166 --> 07:33.400
clouds move with the wind.
I can't stop!

07:33.400 --> 07:35.767
Oh, whoa!
What's this?

07:35.767 --> 07:37.900
Please, I want to eat in peace.

07:37.900 --> 07:41.300
I didn't expect to be
surrounded by wild animals.

07:41.300 --> 07:45.100
Oh, I'm sorry.
That's my fault. I-- I-- Whoa!

07:45.100 --> 07:47.000
I'm blowing into the store!

07:47.000 --> 07:48.734
- Whoa!
- There she goes.

07:48.734 --> 07:50.967
Whoa! Whoa!

07:50.967 --> 07:53.233
Come down! Stop!
Come down! Whoa! Oh!

07:53.233 --> 07:55.367
Excuse me, sir.
Have you been waited on?

07:55.367 --> 07:57.900
- Oh, no! Not you!
- Elmo: Grover!

07:57.900 --> 08:00.033
Ohh. Be right back.

08:00.033 --> 08:03.233
Whoa! Oh, no!
I've blown in a store!

08:03.233 --> 08:06.400
Things are getting foggy
for me now. Whoa!

08:06.400 --> 08:08.867
This sure is a strange way
to cross the street.

08:08.867 --> 08:12.467
All I wanted to do was
to get to the other side.

08:12.467 --> 08:16.066
Uh, where did
all this fog come from?

08:16.066 --> 08:17.667
- Um--

08:17.667 --> 08:21.033
- Well--
And fog!

08:21.033 --> 08:24.834
Chris! Is that you?
I-- I cannot see anything!

08:24.834 --> 08:26.600
- Chris!
- Yeah.

08:26.600 --> 08:28.400
I'm afraid
this is my fault.

08:28.400 --> 08:31.567
You see, fog is just a cloud
that's close to the ground.

08:31.567 --> 08:34.300
Yeah, well,
this is some fog, all right.

08:34.300 --> 08:36.066
Where's the door?

08:36.066 --> 08:38.633
Oh, come on, everybody.
Follow Elmo's voice.

08:38.633 --> 08:40.934
- Follow Elmo's voice.

08:40.934 --> 08:42.200
Not mine.

08:42.200 --> 08:44.767
Yours?
- No, Elmo's.

08:44.767 --> 08:46.300
- Elmo.
- Oh, yeah.

08:46.300 --> 08:50.300
Oh, I see the light!
Yes! Yes! Ha ha ha! Made it.

08:50.300 --> 08:53.066
Wow. Ha ha ha!
That was something.

08:53.066 --> 08:54.700
Mr. Johnson:
Where's my ice cream?!

08:54.700 --> 08:56.400
All:
Oh! Coming, sir!

08:56.400 --> 08:57.734
- Wait.
- Yeah, that's me.

08:57.734 --> 08:58.934
Oh. You got it.

08:58.934 --> 09:01.200
It was very kind
of you to try

09:01.200 --> 09:03.834
to help me, Elmo and Grover.

09:03.834 --> 09:06.233
- Aw.

09:06.233 --> 09:08.100
- Oh, boy.
- Yeah.

09:08.100 --> 09:11.533
Well, it looks like there's
no jobs out there for someone

09:11.533 --> 09:15.033
who is completely made
of floating drops of water.

09:15.033 --> 09:17.033
- Oh.

09:17.033 --> 09:19.533
I have a great job for you--
being a cloud.

09:20.700 --> 09:23.033
Yeah, yeah.
Clouds are super important.

09:23.033 --> 09:24.767
Clouds give-- Let's see,
they give rain

09:24.767 --> 09:27.233
for plants and flowers
to grow, they give shade

09:27.233 --> 09:30.033
so we can stay cool when it's
super hot and sunny outside.

09:30.033 --> 09:32.266
- That is fascinating.
- Yeah!

09:32.266 --> 09:33.700
Think about it.
Without clouds,

09:33.700 --> 09:35.233
it would be really, really hot.

09:35.233 --> 09:38.033
Clouds are super kind
to people and to the Earth.

09:38.033 --> 09:40.533
Wow!
Did you hear that?

09:40.533 --> 09:42.967
Hey! I better get back to work.

09:42.967 --> 09:44.133
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:44.133 --> 09:46.333
That would be great.
We could all use some shade.

09:48.300 --> 09:51.867
Boy, Elmo's going
to miss Floatie.

09:51.867 --> 09:53.166
Aw.

09:53.166 --> 09:55.433

I'm not going very far.

09:55.433 --> 09:58.767

10:14.567 --> 10:16.867

10:16.867 --> 10:18.600

12:56.433 --> 12:58.667

And whatever you do,

Right. Crumb!

13:04.100 --> 13:05.400

Ha ha ha! Hi!

20:31.133 --> 20:33.867
Welcome to Elmo's World!

20:33.867 --> 20:38.233
Oh, guess what Elmo is
wondering about today.

20:38.233 --> 20:40.233
Wait for it.

20:40.233 --> 20:42.834
Wai-ai-ait for it!

20:42.834 --> 20:45.400
Oh, ho ho ho!

20:45.400 --> 20:50.200
♪ Sunny day, thinkin'
'bout clouds today ♪

20:50.200 --> 20:52.200
That's right. Clouds.

20:52.200 --> 20:54.367
Boy, Elmo loves clouds

20:54.367 --> 20:56.967
and wants to find out
more about them.

20:56.967 --> 20:59.900
Let's ask Elmo's friend,
Smartie.

20:59.900 --> 21:01.500
Let's call her together.

21:01.500 --> 21:04.867
♪ Oh, Smartie ♪

21:04.867 --> 21:07.266
( "Elmo's World"
plays on bells )

21:07.266 --> 21:09.533
Hey! Look what
the wind blew in.

21:09.533 --> 21:13.900
Me! A cloud! 'Cause wind
can move clouds.

21:13.900 --> 21:16.533
Oh, ho ho!
Well, that's perfect, Smartie,

21:16.533 --> 21:19.633
because Elmo wants to learn
more about clouds today.

21:19.633 --> 21:22.433
Well, what do we do
to learn something new?

21:22.433 --> 21:25.367
All:
We look it up!

21:25.367 --> 21:29.133
Searching for clouds.
Here we go.

21:29.133 --> 21:31.934
Clouds are made up
of lots of tiny drops of water

21:31.934 --> 21:34.467
that float in the air.

21:34.467 --> 21:37.633
When clouds look dark gray,
and water falls down,

21:37.633 --> 21:41.033
it's rain or sometimes snow.

21:41.033 --> 21:43.166
Some clouds
are white and puffy.

21:43.166 --> 21:45.100
Those are cumulus clouds.

21:45.100 --> 21:47.633
Other clouds look thin
and feathery.

21:47.633 --> 21:49.867
They're called cirrus clouds.

21:49.867 --> 21:53.266
Fog is a kind of cloud
that's low to the ground.

21:53.266 --> 21:55.567
One of the best parts
about clouds is

21:55.567 --> 21:57.867
it's fun to find shapes
in clouds.

21:57.867 --> 22:01.533
Hey, that cloud kind of looks
like someone I know.

22:01.533 --> 22:03.700
- Kids: Elmo!
- Smartie: Elmo.

22:05.066 --> 22:07.734
Boy, that was so much fun!

22:07.734 --> 22:09.834
Time for me
to blow on out of here.

22:09.834 --> 22:11.400
See you later, Elmo.

22:11.400 --> 22:12.633
Oh, ho ho ho!

22:12.633 --> 22:15.367
Thank you, Smartie.
Bye-bye!

22:15.367 --> 22:20.300
Ha ha! Boy, Elmo never knew that
you could see shapes in clouds.

22:20.300 --> 22:24.100
Hey! That gives Elmo an idea.

22:24.100 --> 22:26.834
Ho ho! Let's play
a game together.

22:26.834 --> 22:29.133
Yeah. Come on, come on.

22:29.133 --> 22:30.333
Ha ha!

22:35.900 --> 22:38.967
Sometimes clouds look
like things.

22:38.967 --> 22:41.300
Let's see if we
can find the shapes

22:41.300 --> 22:43.333
of all of these animals

22:43.333 --> 22:45.367
in the clouds that float by.

22:45.367 --> 22:46.700
Are you ready?

22:46.700 --> 22:48.600
Let's play.

22:48.600 --> 22:50.233
Girl: Let's see.

22:50.233 --> 22:52.700
That cloud doesn't look
like anything.

22:52.700 --> 22:54.667
Elmo: Oh, here comes
another one.

22:54.667 --> 22:57.600
Does this cloud look like
one of the animals?

22:57.600 --> 23:00.367
Girl 2: That cloud looks
like it has long ears,

23:00.367 --> 23:01.934
like the bunny rabbit.

23:01.934 --> 23:04.900
Yeah, it does look
like a bunny rabbit!

23:04.900 --> 23:08.166
Ooh, let's look for
another animal shape.

23:08.166 --> 23:11.000
Boy: Ooh, there.
Look at that cloud.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.967
It looks like the bird.

23:12.967 --> 23:16.433
Hey, yeah!
That looks like a birdie.

23:16.433 --> 23:19.233
OK, one animal shape left.

23:19.233 --> 23:21.900
Girl: Oh, look.
It's the elephant.

23:21.900 --> 23:25.100
You're right!
It does look like
an elephant!

23:25.100 --> 23:26.867
Yay! We did it!

23:26.867 --> 23:29.200
Oh, good job, everybody!

23:29.200 --> 23:31.333
Boy, that was cool!

23:31.333 --> 23:34.967
Snow comes from clouds.
Rain comes from clouds.

23:34.967 --> 23:36.533
Oh, hey!

23:36.533 --> 23:39.834
That makes Elmo
wonder even more.

23:39.834 --> 23:43.200
Oh, what does Mr. Noodle do
when it rains?

23:43.200 --> 23:47.367
Oh, let's ask him.
Hey, Mr. Noodle!

23:47.367 --> 23:49.133
Oh, ho ho!

23:49.133 --> 23:52.333
It's Mr. Noodle's
poodle, Schmoodle.

23:52.333 --> 23:54.767
- Hi there, Schmoodle.

23:54.767 --> 23:58.200
Schmoodle, that looks
like a rain cloud.

23:58.200 --> 24:00.100
What does Schmoodle do
when it rains?

24:03.533 --> 24:05.700
Girl: He looks like
he's at the beach!

24:05.700 --> 24:08.100
Elmo: You don't go to
the beach when it rains.

24:08.100 --> 24:10.300
What do you do when it
rains, Schmoodle?

24:11.500 --> 24:13.500
Boy:
Ha ha ha! Look!

24:13.500 --> 24:15.800
He's all ready to play
in the snow.

24:15.800 --> 24:17.633
Elmo: That's what you do
when it snows,

24:17.633 --> 24:19.867
but what does Schmoodle
do when it rains?

24:19.867 --> 24:22.166
Girl 2:
That's more like it.

24:22.166 --> 24:24.233
He's wearing a raincoat.

24:24.233 --> 24:26.633
That'll keep him dry.

24:26.633 --> 24:29.667
Boy: Going in his doghouse
will keep him dry, too.

24:29.667 --> 24:31.900
- Boy: Looks like
Schmoodle likes

24:31.900 --> 24:34.667
to have a dance party
on rainy days.

24:34.667 --> 24:37.433
Rainy days can be fun!

24:37.433 --> 24:39.900
Thank you, Schmoodle.
Bye-bye!

24:39.900 --> 24:41.333
- Boy.

24:41.333 --> 24:44.767
Learning new things
makes Elmo so happy,

it makes him want to dance.
