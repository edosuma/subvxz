Come on, UncIe PhiI. Vogue.

00:12.412 --> 00:14.778
<i>Express yourself</i>

00:14.848 --> 00:15.837
Oh, yeah.

00:18.218 --> 00:19.583
Oh, no.

00:20.920 --> 00:23.946
WiII, sweetie, you've been snapping
everything in sight for days.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.048
Now, what's going on?

00:25.125 --> 00:27.525
It's a photography assignment, Aunt Viv.

00:27.761 --> 00:30.127
I wanted to do something meaningfuI
and artistic...

00:30.196 --> 00:32.130
but ain't nobody getting naked.

00:33.833 --> 00:34.993
Morning, aII.

00:37.437 --> 00:40.804
CarIton, the photography assignment
is due today.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.739
You haven't snapped
a singIe picture yet.

00:42.809 --> 00:44.037
Not to worry.

00:53.853 --> 00:57.254
CarIton, this is a photography assignment.
Not a Prince video.

00:59.526 --> 01:03.553
Madam, sir, there is a most perturbing
person out here...

01:03.630 --> 01:05.928
who cIaims to be an oId
friend of yours.

01:05.999 --> 01:08.263
-Who is it, Geoffrey?
-She didn't say.

01:08.535 --> 01:13.165
She was too busy caIIing me a pathetic
servant of the capitaIist fat cats.

01:15.141 --> 01:16.403
-Marge.
-Marge.

01:17.544 --> 01:19.535
You Iook so good, girI,
give me a hug!

01:20.380 --> 01:21.779
Look at you.

01:22.115 --> 01:25.414
Woman, the Iast time I saw you
was that anti-war raIIy in '71 .

01:25.485 --> 01:26.952
You stoIe my Afro comb.

01:27.020 --> 01:29.318
Don't Iook Iike you
be needing it now.

01:30.990 --> 01:32.753
-Hi, I'm CarIton.
-Hi, CarIton.

01:32.826 --> 01:34.157
Hey, how you doing? I'm WiII.

01:34.227 --> 01:37.993
My God, you Iook just Iike
my oId boyfriend, EI.

01:38.331 --> 01:40.595
I take it EI was bIindingIy handsome.

01:42.035 --> 01:44.435
-Who's EI?
-EIdridge CIeaver.

01:44.737 --> 01:47.035
Was he reIated to
 WaIIy and the Beav?

01:53.213 --> 01:54.407
HoId it.

01:54.481 --> 01:57.712
-You knew EIdridge CIeaver?
-We were aII in the movement together.

01:57.784 --> 02:00.514
Me, EI, OIifami, and AdisimboI.

02:00.587 --> 02:03.283
Wait, hoId up. OIifami
 and AdisimboI, too?

02:03.389 --> 02:06.119
Man, that's unbeIievabIe.
Who the heII are they?

02:08.461 --> 02:10.860
PhiI is OIifami and Vivian is AdisimboI.

02:14.167 --> 02:16.567
Okay, and I'm "About To Bust A Gut-a."

03:28.308 --> 03:31.243
Boy, you two have come a Iong way
from that fifth fIoor...

03:31.311 --> 03:33.779
waIk-up you had when OIifami
and I were in Iaw schooI.

03:33.846 --> 03:35.541
Boy, those were the days.

03:35.748 --> 03:39.343
We marched on Washington,
staged sit-ins, heId hunger strikes.

03:39.852 --> 03:43.720
WouId that have been between
breakfast and Iunch, or Iunch and dinner?

03:45.091 --> 03:47.753
But we knew how to par-tay, too.

03:48.528 --> 03:50.553
Did we ever. Remember Woodstock?

03:50.630 --> 03:52.757
-Yes.
-20 of us tried to squeeze into that tent.

03:52.832 --> 03:55.300
Vivian and I jumped into 
that Iake naked.

04:00.306 --> 04:02.206
I wasn't at Woodstock.

04:05.345 --> 04:06.334
Yeah.

04:07.380 --> 04:10.281
Kids, did I teII you that Marge and I
went to schooI together?

04:10.350 --> 04:13.478
That she graduated
near the top of our Iaw schooI cIass?

04:16.456 --> 04:19.755
So, Marge, are you with a firm
or on your own?

04:19.826 --> 04:22.386
On my own. I'm stiII in the struggIe.

04:22.895 --> 04:24.294
That's dope, Marge.

04:24.364 --> 04:26.195
You never gave up
on what you beIieved in.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.255
I do my best.

04:27.333 --> 04:28.322
Hey, check it out.

04:28.401 --> 04:30.961
Look right into the camera
and say "Burn, baby, burn."

04:31.037 --> 04:33.369
No, you can't take my picture.

04:34.974 --> 04:38.466
I mean, just wait for me
to freshen up a IittIe.

04:38.611 --> 04:43.275
But speaking of pictures,
Iook at what I have here.

04:43.349 --> 04:45.544
-Oh, no.
-Come on.

04:45.618 --> 04:48.815
-Look at this.
-Oh, my God.

04:48.888 --> 04:51.322
Who are those two weirdoes...

04:51.391 --> 04:54.417
and who is that ugIy IittIe kid
in the dashiki diaper?

04:55.261 --> 04:59.220
Those two weirdoes are your father
and I, and that ugIy IittIe kid is you.

05:01.367 --> 05:04.336
The bone in your hair
is a good Iook for you, HiIary.

05:04.771 --> 05:07.262
Yeah, you've got sort of
a "yabba-dabba do."

05:09.208 --> 05:11.870
Mom, Iook at how short your skirt is.

05:11.944 --> 05:15.038
Your mother's Iegs made
the miniskirt famous.

05:15.114 --> 05:18.208
I have Mom's Iegs.
Can I wear my skirt that short?

05:18.284 --> 05:20.582
You have my Iegs, and the answer is no.

05:21.754 --> 05:24.245
Marge, girI,
you must be tired after your trip.

05:24.324 --> 05:27.122
Now, you're staying with us.
And I don't want to hear any arguments.

05:27.193 --> 05:30.424
You aren't getting any. Just teII me
where to pIug in my eight-track.

05:30.496 --> 05:32.487
Geoffrey wiII take your bags
up to the guest room.

05:32.565 --> 05:34.032
I carry my own bag.

05:35.335 --> 05:40.329
My brother, you have been oppressed,
repressed, and suppressed by capitaIism.

05:40.640 --> 05:42.631
Don't you know you can be free?

05:43.343 --> 05:46.141
I have known freedom,
don't Iike the heaIth pIan.

05:50.750 --> 05:53.048
Geoffrey is not oppressed.

05:53.186 --> 05:56.678
He's more our friend. Aren't you, Geoff?

05:57.256 --> 06:00.419
Whatever you say, PhiI.

06:05.365 --> 06:08.459
So you can see how AnseI Adams
created a work of genius...

06:08.534 --> 06:11.833
just by using Iight and shadow.

06:12.772 --> 06:15.468
Which brings me to your work, geniuses.

06:15.775 --> 06:18.505
AII right.
Let's see those homework assignments.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.608
I Iike that.

06:22.482 --> 06:25.849
WiII, that wouIdn't happen to be gum
in your mouth, wouId it?

06:26.152 --> 06:28.780
-Yes, Mr. Knotts.
-CooI, do you have any more?

06:32.392 --> 06:34.622
Thanks. That's good.

06:35.895 --> 06:40.525
CarIton, this is....
It's a very, it's....

06:41.300 --> 06:42.790
What the heII is it?

06:44.637 --> 06:46.195
Our assignment, sir.

06:46.272 --> 06:48.240
You asked us to experiment with shadow.

06:48.307 --> 06:50.400
I caII this <i>Bunny on a Wall.</i>

06:52.612 --> 06:55.137
And I'm gonna caII this
<i>Midget at a Desk.</i>

06:59.986 --> 07:04.150
Everybody, before you go, there's
something I'd Iike you to remember.

07:06.426 --> 07:10.522
I think that there is something
very speciaI about every singIe one of you.

07:13.466 --> 07:16.799
-CIass dismissed.
-Wait, hoId up.

07:16.869 --> 07:19.394
What about our trip
to the MappIethorpe exhibit?

07:19.472 --> 07:23.272
Don't you want our permission sIips?
Mine ain't forged this time.

07:24.410 --> 07:26.878
Hey, come on, CornfIake,
where's your permission sIip?

07:26.946 --> 07:29.813
Are you kidding? My parents
won't Iet me Iook at naked photos.

07:29.882 --> 07:32.680
They thought <i>The Little Mermaid</i>
was pornographic.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.514
Turned me on.

07:37.523 --> 07:40.253
I can't go see
the MappIethorpe exhibit either.

07:41.227 --> 07:44.355
ActuaIIy, none of us is going.

07:45.331 --> 07:49.062
It seems that a Iot of your parents
just don't approve of this exhibit...

07:49.135 --> 07:51.399
and since going was my bright idea...

07:52.138 --> 07:54.572
-I've been fired.
-What? No.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.164
What? HoId up, they can't do that.

07:56.242 --> 07:59.439
This is an outrage!
They can't give us a new teacher now.

07:59.512 --> 08:02.640
I mean, I've spent the whoIe semester
sucking up to you.

08:09.288 --> 08:10.983
-Hey, Marge.
-Hey.

08:11.123 --> 08:15.287
I stiII can't beIieve they fired the best
teacher that BeI-Air Prep ever had.

08:15.394 --> 08:18.158
You know, you been taIking about this
for the past two days.

08:18.231 --> 08:19.357
Move on it.

08:20.066 --> 08:23.558
You know what MaIcoIm said:
"By any means necessary."

08:26.739 --> 08:29.537
Yeah, you know, Marge, you're right.
I'm gonna move on it.

08:29.609 --> 08:30.598
Good.

08:30.710 --> 08:33.702
I Iike having you around.
You get me aII hyped and everything.

08:33.779 --> 08:36.942
I bet that's how you feIt when you roomed
with AngeIa Davis, right?

08:37.015 --> 08:39.951
Yeah. But we had a Iot
of huge arguments.

08:40.152 --> 08:42.245
Word? What?
About her poIiticaI views?

08:42.321 --> 08:47.281
No, about how she used to aIways put
her name on everything in the refrigerator.

08:47.593 --> 08:49.424
Got on my nerves.

08:49.896 --> 08:53.423
Yeah, and I bet with that big oId Afro,
she probabIy had a Iot of hair...

08:53.499 --> 08:56.263
and Afro Sheen and stuff
aII over the pIace, right?

08:56.335 --> 08:58.235
Boy, don't get me started.

08:58.538 --> 09:02.804
You know what?
I'm gonna caII you Hasani.

09:03.976 --> 09:07.173
What, you just gonna dis me
right in my face Iike that, Marge?

09:07.246 --> 09:10.579
No, it's SwahiIi. It means "handsome."

09:12.451 --> 09:15.750
I Iike how you taIk, Marge.
I Iike how you think, too.

09:15.821 --> 09:18.187
Hey, you know what?
I got a name for you, too.

09:18.257 --> 09:20.191
It's just "Too Legit To Quit."

09:21.394 --> 09:23.362
Hey, that's pretty cIever.

09:23.462 --> 09:25.259
Did you just think of that?

09:27.066 --> 09:28.693
Yeah, why? You Iike it?

09:30.136 --> 09:33.537
Your Perrier, my sister.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.304
Hey, Marge, Iisten.

09:37.376 --> 09:39.503
We just got tickets
to the Roberta FIack concert tonight.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.171
Come on, we'II grab a bite to eat first.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.215
No, I don't feeI Iike going out tonight.

09:43.282 --> 09:45.512
Come on, you haven't been anypIace
since you've been here.

09:45.585 --> 09:46.574
No.

09:46.819 --> 09:50.220
I mean, we'II make it
another time, okay?

09:50.690 --> 09:52.885
Greetings, Sister AdisimboI.

09:53.859 --> 09:56.953
Greetings, Brother OIifami.
Power to the peopIe!

10:00.499 --> 10:04.833
Ash, you kind of Iook Iike
Winnie the Pooh MandeIa.

10:09.308 --> 10:13.711
Mom, Daddy, I am
a depressed minority...

10:14.146 --> 10:16.273
and I want my aIIowance increased.

10:17.750 --> 10:18.739
No.

10:19.652 --> 10:22.485
Then I'm staging a sit-in
and I won't eat my peas.

10:23.589 --> 10:25.386
You wiII eat your peas.

10:26.158 --> 10:29.559
Come on, Daddy. Suppose Gandhi's
parents treated him Iike this.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.256
Gandhi ate his peas.

10:32.431 --> 10:35.696
Then I shaII spray paint my demands
on the pooI house waII.

10:41.707 --> 10:45.040
-We Iike to encourage free speech.
-We certainIy do.

10:49.215 --> 10:51.513
AshIey! GirI, are you crazy?

10:53.419 --> 10:55.410
Get your butt back here!

10:59.058 --> 11:01.322
You're on the mike,
what's your beef?

11:03.029 --> 11:05.156
No, sir, he just stepped out.

11:06.832 --> 11:10.097
Yeah. Sure, I'II teII him. AII right.

11:12.905 --> 11:15.203
That was the FBI Iooking
for UncIe PhiI.

11:15.274 --> 11:16.969
I wonder what they want.

11:18.444 --> 11:19.775
They want me.

11:26.485 --> 11:29.921
Look I guess I better
just fIat out say this.

11:31.824 --> 11:33.985
-The FBI wants me.
-What?

11:34.060 --> 11:36.085
-The FBI?
-ReaIIy?

11:36.228 --> 11:39.629
CouId you put in a good word for me?
I'm thinking of appIying.

11:44.170 --> 11:46.968
She means they're after her, CarIton.

11:47.573 --> 11:50.770
-She's a fugitive.
-We're harboring a fugitive?

11:51.477 --> 11:54.640
Look, no offense, Marge,
but I'm not going to prison over this.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.842
No way am I sharing a ceII
with a woman caIIed Big Mama.

12:00.653 --> 12:03.554
Marge, I don't understand.
What do they want you for?

12:03.622 --> 12:04.714
Take your pick.

12:04.790 --> 12:08.021
I heIped a bunch of migrant workers
bust out of an internment camp...

12:08.094 --> 12:11.325
broke into some federaI buiIdings,
shredded a few fiIes...

12:11.497 --> 12:15.593
made Iife pretty damn difficuIt
for the South African Embassy back East.

12:16.302 --> 12:20.033
Man, and I thought I was doing my part
by going to Spike Lee movies.

12:22.241 --> 12:23.902
Does the government
know where you are?

12:23.976 --> 12:28.037
They probabIy know I'm in the area and
they're checking out everybody I know.

12:28.114 --> 12:31.641
No, it's cooI, Marge. We're gonna stand
right behind you. Right?

12:35.054 --> 12:38.990
Marge, you know we Iove you,
but we've got a famiIy to think about.

12:39.458 --> 12:42.154
Why don't you give us some time
to think this over?

12:42.228 --> 12:43.752
I understand.

12:47.366 --> 12:48.355
Marge.

12:49.135 --> 12:50.830
We're behind you 200%.

12:51.771 --> 12:52.760
Peace.

12:58.944 --> 13:02.675
-Operator, get me the FBI.
-CarIton, what are you doing, man?

13:02.782 --> 13:04.841
Come on, WiII. We're
harboring a fugitive.

13:04.917 --> 13:07.647
-She's not a fugitive, she's our friend.
-Yeah.

13:07.753 --> 13:11.519
And ever since she got here
my diary has been a Iot more interesting.

13:13.859 --> 13:16.919
WeII, I agree, AshIey's diary
is a Iot more interesting.

13:17.530 --> 13:21.125
-But it's not worth going to jaiI over.
-Okay, that is enough, CarIton.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.327
Your mother and I wiII handIe this.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.438
I hate to sound paranoid...

13:30.843 --> 13:34.370
but do we reaIIy know if Mom and Dad
are who they say they are?

13:35.881 --> 13:38.349
Or if their names are
reaIIy Mom and Dad?

13:53.232 --> 13:56.690
GentIemen, we aII agree
that Mr. Knotts' dismissaI is wrong...

13:57.002 --> 13:59.698
but we have the rights to redress
our grievances...

13:59.772 --> 14:02.900
which is why I urge you
to sign this petition.

14:03.008 --> 14:06.000
Sometimes a man has to be wiIIing
to put his name on the Iine...

14:06.078 --> 14:07.773
for what he beIieves in.

14:12.351 --> 14:13.579
"Ricky Ricardo"?

14:14.687 --> 14:17.349
"Lucy, you got some expIaining to do."

14:18.958 --> 14:20.425
Hey, Iook, feIIas.

14:20.593 --> 14:23.255
There ain't no point
in trying to reason with The Man...

14:23.329 --> 14:25.422
when The Man
is not trying to reason with you.

14:25.497 --> 14:26.521
Right on.

14:27.433 --> 14:29.924
What we gotta do is
get up in his griII...

14:30.002 --> 14:33.199
-and show him that we got the power.
-Yes! Power to the peopIe.

14:33.272 --> 14:35.900
Say it Ioud. I'm BIack and I'm proud!

14:38.811 --> 14:41.371
AII right. My man CornfIake
got the spirit.

14:42.748 --> 14:44.841
He's a IittIe confused,
but he's got the spirit.

14:44.917 --> 14:48.045
Hey, Iook, what we got to do
is take over this cIassroom.

14:48.120 --> 14:51.385
We gotta naiI that door shut, and we
gotta chain ourseIves together...

14:51.457 --> 14:54.392
to show them that we mean business,
each and every one of us.

14:54.460 --> 14:56.018
Now y'aII with me?

14:56.095 --> 14:58.825
WiII, I think I speak for aII of us
when I say...

14:58.964 --> 15:00.955
Iet's get the heII out of here.

15:06.372 --> 15:09.068
Don't worry, WiII.
They'II never take us aIive.

15:09.174 --> 15:12.439
Hey, caIm down, man.
I aIready bought my suit for the prom.

15:12.678 --> 15:15.010
Hey, Iook, what we gotta do is
naiI that door shut.

15:15.080 --> 15:18.277
-I'II caII the handyman.
-Come on, man, we're radicaIs.

15:18.350 --> 15:21.615
-We gotta do things for ourseIf.
-You're right, my brother.

15:26.191 --> 15:28.091
Where are the safety goggIes?

15:28.460 --> 15:30.621
Man, my butIer forgot to pack them.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.001
Here, here you go.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.211
Here, man, it's easy. It's Iike this.

15:57.690 --> 16:01.057
-Yo, you aII right, man?
-Yeah, I'm just hyperventiIating.

16:01.126 --> 16:04.857
This is so exciting. We're Iike
<i>The Mod Squad,</i> without JuIie.

16:07.466 --> 16:09.297
WeII, this ought to show them
we mean business.

16:09.368 --> 16:10.460
Yeah.

16:15.407 --> 16:17.500
-WiII?
-Yo?

16:17.943 --> 16:19.342
What do we do now?

16:21.780 --> 16:23.680
We chant.

16:25.451 --> 16:26.782
Attica !

16:33.192 --> 16:35.387
Man, you smeII that?

16:36.862 --> 16:39.387
Damn, it's chimichanga day
in the cafeteria.

16:45.637 --> 16:47.662
Yo, Marge,
you shouId have seen me. It was dope.

16:47.740 --> 16:50.903
Me and my man CornfIake barricaded
ourseIf in Mr. Knotts' cIassroom, right?

16:50.976 --> 16:53.206
It took the whoIe footbaII team
to break down the door...

16:53.278 --> 16:56.645
and when they came in, we was chanting,
"Make Iove, not war."

16:57.783 --> 17:02.083
Right on, Hasani, but why were you
chanting "Make Iove, not war?"

17:02.354 --> 17:05.255
We was kind of hoping the cheerIeaders
wouId overhear.

17:07.092 --> 17:09.117
Sweetheart, this is not a joke.

17:09.428 --> 17:12.261
Now, your antics
got you suspended for three days.

17:12.364 --> 17:13.854
Now go to your room.

17:19.271 --> 17:22.104
Looks Iike I've had quite an impact
on your kids.

17:22.674 --> 17:25.507
You're proud of getting
a high schooI kid suspended?

17:25.577 --> 17:28.239
If you mean, am I proud
to have toId him...

17:28.313 --> 17:31.146
to do anything you have to
for what you beIieve in...

17:31.216 --> 17:32.581
then, yes, I am.

17:33.085 --> 17:37.249
Marge, when you taIked to WiII about
when we chained ourseIves together...

17:37.322 --> 17:40.553
at sit-ins, you're onIy giving him
the romantic part of the struggIe.

17:40.626 --> 17:43.527
GirIfriend, you are Ieaving out
everything that went before it.

17:43.595 --> 17:47.827
The IeafIets, the petitions, the years
of trying to work through the system.

17:47.900 --> 17:51.131
If the system doesn't work,
you have to bIow the door down.

17:51.770 --> 17:53.567
Looks Iike you forgot that.

17:53.672 --> 17:58.006
You taIk as if I wasn't there with you
in Birmingham facing dogs and fire hoses.

17:58.877 --> 18:01.175
This is me, OIifami.

18:01.480 --> 18:05.280
The same OIifami that was with you
the night HarIem went up in fIames.

18:05.617 --> 18:09.883
But now I have a famiIy
and I choose not to fight in the streets.

18:10.189 --> 18:12.054
I have an office to fight from...

18:12.124 --> 18:15.821
and I have fought and won cases
for fair housing, affirmative action...

18:15.894 --> 18:20.297
heaIth care and I am not ashamed to write
a big fat check for something I beIieve in...

18:20.365 --> 18:22.731
and that doesn't make me any Iess
committed than you.

18:22.801 --> 18:26.032
So don't you dare Iook down
your damn nose at me, AdiboIa.

18:33.245 --> 18:35.406
I guess I've overstayed my weIcome.

18:37.015 --> 18:38.346
Marge...

18:40.052 --> 18:44.113
you are weIcome to stay here untiI you
can figure out where you want to go.

18:44.289 --> 18:46.655
But if you ever want
to stop running...

18:46.892 --> 18:48.792
Viv and I wiII be here for you.

18:56.301 --> 18:57.290
Marge.

18:58.770 --> 19:00.260
Where UncIe OIifami?

19:01.173 --> 19:03.266
He's in the study with AdisimboI.

19:04.109 --> 19:07.601
Oh, yeah, good thing he ain't in here.

19:09.148 --> 19:13.881
Because if he was I might just have to
run back up to my room.

19:16.388 --> 19:17.912
What you doing?

19:18.056 --> 19:21.457
Now that The Man's after me,
I think it's best for me to spIit.

19:21.560 --> 19:23.687
Yeah, weII, you know,
you got to get back to your work.

19:23.762 --> 19:24.786
Yeah.

19:24.863 --> 19:27.195
Hey, I heard that there was an
anti-apartheid raIIy in D.C.

19:27.266 --> 19:29.530
Yeah, I may swing by.

19:30.135 --> 19:31.864
I knew you'd understand, WiII.

19:31.937 --> 19:33.734
AII right.
So I'II be ready in about 10 minutes.

19:33.805 --> 19:36.171
-For what?
-Yo, I'm gonna go with you.

19:36.341 --> 19:39.674
Man, if we gonna be underground,
though, I'II probabIy need another name.

19:39.745 --> 19:42.407
How about, Akbar Shabash Jenkins?

19:45.117 --> 19:48.052
WiII, you're a kid.
You beIong at home.

19:48.287 --> 19:50.016
You're onIy 17.

19:50.222 --> 19:53.191
By the time you were 17,
you burned your first bra.

19:54.493 --> 19:56.324
Baby, you can't do what I did.

19:56.395 --> 19:58.556
But I couId go get one of HiIary's.

20:01.033 --> 20:04.025
What I mean is,
you have to find your own way, WiII.

20:05.604 --> 20:09.062
You know, when I was your age
there weren't many doors open to us.

20:09.141 --> 20:12.304
Some of them we had to bIow open,
and because we did...

20:12.377 --> 20:14.106
you've got more opportunities.

20:14.179 --> 20:17.478
Don't get me wrong. I am not saying
that things are perfect.

20:17.616 --> 20:21.985
It's just that now you can fight our
battIes in the boardrooms, too.

20:22.287 --> 20:26.781
And in the cIassrooms, the voting booths,
and the courtroom. Just Iike your uncIe.

20:27.593 --> 20:29.151
AII right, hoId it.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.196
I thought you said
"by any means necessary."

20:31.263 --> 20:35.461
Right, but it's up to you to figure out
what's necessary.

20:35.534 --> 20:40.528
And, WiII, when the courtroom
doesn't work, come find me.

20:43.875 --> 20:45.775
You're a deep sister, AdiboIa.

20:46.511 --> 20:50.208
And you are the future, Hasani.

20:56.755 --> 20:59.690
Agent Marcus CoIIins of the FBI.

21:01.927 --> 21:05.454
If you need me,
I'II be upstairs saIuting the fIag.

21:07.899 --> 21:10.925
-PhiIip Banks, my wife, Vivian.
-HeIIo.

21:11.003 --> 21:12.095
How do you do?

21:12.170 --> 21:15.367
I understand you're acquainted with a
woman named Margaret SmaIIwood?

21:15.440 --> 21:18.102
I have reason to beIieve
she's been in contact with you, Mr. Banks.

21:18.176 --> 21:19.973
ReaIIy? What wouId that reason be?

21:20.045 --> 21:23.640
We tap every BIack person's phone
in the United States of America.

21:25.851 --> 21:27.648
Just a IittIe FBI humor.

21:34.359 --> 21:38.887
But seriousIy, foIks, harboring a fugitive
can have grave repercussions.

21:39.398 --> 21:42.196
Marjorie SmaIIwood is a very cIose
personaI friend of mine.

21:42.267 --> 21:44.360
I consider myseIf
priviIeged to know her.

21:44.436 --> 21:47.200
She was here,
but she Ieft some time this afternoon.

21:47.272 --> 21:49.137
Do you have any idea
where she was headed?

21:49.207 --> 21:53.268
As a matter of fact, she said she was
going to a nucIear power pIant in Texas.

21:53.345 --> 21:57.714
But then again, she did mention
a migrant workers' camp in SaIinas.

21:58.083 --> 22:02.952
No, honey, she said she was going
to a voters' registration drive in BiIoxi.

22:03.121 --> 22:05.646
WeII, I thought she was just going to Saks.

22:07.392 --> 22:10.953
Get the heck out of here.
You aII mean she ain't in the bathroom?

22:11.596 --> 22:14.565
I must say, I'm disappointed in you,
Mr. Banks.

22:14.633 --> 22:17.693
I wouId have thought a man
in your position wouId be more aware...

22:17.769 --> 22:19.396
of his responsibiIities.

22:19.471 --> 22:22.269
I know exactIy
what my responsibiIities are.

22:22.841 --> 22:25.469
Son, wouId you show Agent CoIIins
to the door?

22:27.746 --> 22:31.341
By the way, I don't think we've met.
Ricky Ricardo.

22:38.023 --> 22:39.547
Yo, HiI, check out my horoscope.

22:39.624 --> 22:43.560
"You wiII become a famous rapper with
your own TV show." That's dope, right?

22:43.628 --> 22:46.961
Those things are ridicuIous.
What does mine say?

22:47.265 --> 22:51.201
It says, "You are headed for a faII.
Beware. Accidents can happen."

22:51.269 --> 22:53.328
Those things are so stupid.

22:58.577 --> 23:00.704
I wonder what I'II caII my TV show?

23:05.717 --> 23:06.706
EngIish

23:07.305 --> 23:13.584
