WEBVTT

00:08.333 --> 00:12.083
[typing]

00:12.083 --> 00:14.667
- YOU HAD A SCRIPT THAT WAS
GOING AROUND BACK THEN.

00:14.667 --> 00:17.041
IT WAS ALL ANYONE TALKED ABOUT.

00:17.041 --> 00:19.500
- WE ARE NOT LOOKING
TO DO ANOTHER SHOW HERE.

00:19.500 --> 00:21.000
- CBS WANTS IN.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.834
THAT'S THREE NETWORKS.

00:22.834 --> 00:25.375
- WELL, ONLY ONE
IS GETTING IT.

00:25.375 --> 00:26.333
- THIS IS FUN.

00:26.333 --> 00:27.458
- WE HAVE SPENT A YEAR

00:27.458 --> 00:29.458
FEELING ABSOLUTELY
POWERLESS.

00:29.458 --> 00:31.667
AS SOON AS WE SAY YES
TO ONE OF THOSE FUCKERS,

00:31.667 --> 00:32.542
WE'RE RIGHT BACK THERE.

00:32.542 --> 00:33.917
BUT IF WE GO NOW,

00:33.917 --> 00:36.333
WITH ALL OF THEM
FIGHTING OVER US,

00:36.333 --> 00:39.750
THAT'S AS GOOD AS IT GETS
IN THIS TOWN.

00:39.750 --> 00:41.417
- I ALSO HEARD
ABOUT MATT LEBLANC

00:41.417 --> 00:43.375
GETTING THAT BIG PILOT
OVER AT NBC.

00:43.375 --> 00:44.750
- WHAT?

00:44.750 --> 00:46.542
HAVE WE OFFICIALLY CANCELLED
PUCKS!?

00:46.542 --> 00:48.375
- UH, NO.

00:48.375 --> 00:50.250
- PICK IT UP FOR SIX MORE.

00:50.250 --> 00:51.750
- YOU HATE PUCKS!

00:51.750 --> 00:54.041
- I HATE NBC MORE.

00:54.041 --> 00:55.959
- ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?

00:55.959 --> 00:58.917
THEY CAN'T DO THAT.
WE WERE CANCELLED.

00:58.917 --> 01:00.875
WHAT DOES
"NOT OFFICIALLY" MEAN?

01:00.875 --> 01:02.417
- HARD TO BELIEVE
THAT YESTERDAY

01:02.417 --> 01:03.750
WE WERE SITTING IN TRAFFIC
ON THE 405.

01:03.750 --> 01:04.709
- HMM.

01:04.709 --> 01:07.583
- IT'S AN L.A. NUMBER.

01:07.583 --> 01:10.875
- DON'T ANSWER IT.

01:10.875 --> 01:13.291
OH, DEAR GOD,
DON'T ANSWER IT.

01:13.291 --> 01:15.917
[ringing continues]

01:18.917 --> 01:22.291
[typing]

01:22.291 --> 01:23.917
[ding]

01:23.917 --> 01:27.709
[wind blowing]

01:32.625 --> 01:35.500
[upbeat music]

01:35.500 --> 01:43.583
â™ª â™ª

01:58.959 --> 02:00.792
[gunshot]

02:07.834 --> 02:10.875
[typing]

02:10.875 --> 02:12.083
[ding]

02:15.208 --> 02:17.959
BLOODY RIDICULOUS.

02:19.750 --> 02:22.417
- UTTER BULLSHIT.

02:30.875 --> 02:32.667
- REASON FOR ENTERING
THE COUNTRY?

02:32.667 --> 02:35.834
- MATT LEBLANC.

02:44.208 --> 02:47.750
- I THREW AWAY MY I.D.
I'M HERE FOR PUCKS!

02:47.750 --> 02:49.000
- I THOUGHT THAT WAS DEAD.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.083
- YEAH, WELL, IT'S RISEN.
LIKE JESUS.

02:51.083 --> 02:55.208
IF JESUS WAS A SHITTY SITCOM
NO ONE WATCHED.

03:05.375 --> 03:07.959
- [sighs]

03:10.500 --> 03:13.291
MOTHERFUCKER.

03:23.375 --> 03:25.291
- OKAY.

03:25.291 --> 03:28.625
ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE
TO SAY FIRST?

03:28.625 --> 03:30.208
- UH...

03:30.208 --> 03:32.709
WE WROTE THIS
ON THE PLANE BACK.

03:32.709 --> 03:35.375
IT'S NOT VERY GOOD.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.834
- IT'S NOT.

03:41.959 --> 03:43.542
- ALL RIGHTY THEN.

03:43.542 --> 03:44.875
UH, PAGE ONE.

03:44.875 --> 03:46.792
"INTERIOR LOCKER ROOM."

03:46.792 --> 03:49.417
WORDS I THOUGHT
I'D NEVER SAY AGAIN.

03:49.417 --> 03:53.208
"LYMAN ENTERS."

03:55.375 --> 03:57.041
- NOW THE GOOD NEWS IS

03:57.041 --> 03:59.208
I SHUFFLED
SOME STUFF AROUND,

03:59.208 --> 04:00.792
AND I GOT YOU
YOUR OLD OFFICE BACK.

04:00.792 --> 04:01.875
- REALLY?

04:01.875 --> 04:03.750
NO ONE SNATCHED IT UP.

04:03.750 --> 04:06.500
- EVEN BETTER,
WENDY WAS STILL AVAILABLE.

04:06.500 --> 04:10.375
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO START
WITH SOMEONE FROM SCRATCH.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.250
- HUH?

04:12.250 --> 04:17.208
- AND WITH ONE WORD,
IT ALL COMES RUSHING BACK.

04:39.667 --> 04:41.750
[phone rings]

04:41.750 --> 04:43.417
- YO.

04:43.417 --> 04:44.792
- MATT, SANFORD SHAMIRO.

04:44.792 --> 04:46.583
- HEY, WHAT'S UP?

04:46.583 --> 04:48.250
- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HEARD
THE NEWS ABOUT LARRY PENZEL.

04:48.250 --> 04:50.458
- WHAT NEWS?

04:50.458 --> 04:51.750
- I'M AFRAID IT'S NOT GOOD.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.041
- NO?

04:53.041 --> 04:55.667
- LARRY KILLED HIMSELF
LAST NIGHT.

04:55.667 --> 04:57.250
- HOLY SHIT.

04:57.250 --> 04:58.792
- I KNOW.
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

04:58.792 --> 05:00.625
ARLENE CALLED ME
THIS MORNING.

05:00.625 --> 05:03.834
EVIDENTLY, HE HANGED HIMSELF
IN HIS GARAGE.

05:03.834 --> 05:05.000
- OH, MY GOD.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.917
- HEARTBREAKING.

05:06.917 --> 05:09.083
- [mouthing words]

05:09.083 --> 05:11.500
- HIS DAUGHTER FOUND HIM.
SHE'S ONLY NINE.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.291
- JESUS.

05:13.291 --> 05:15.834
- ANYWAY THE FUNERAL'S
TOMORROW IF YOU WANT TO GO.

05:15.834 --> 05:17.166
- WELL, I GUESS I SHOULD.

05:17.166 --> 05:20.041
HE'S BEEN MY MONEY GUY
SINCE I GOT MONEY.

05:20.041 --> 05:22.667
- I'LL TEXT YOU
THE INFORMATION.

05:22.667 --> 05:26.834
AND I'M SORRY TO BE
THE BEARER OF BAD NEWS.

05:26.834 --> 05:28.417
[horn honks]

05:28.417 --> 05:30.083
- [mouths words]

05:31.834 --> 05:33.625
- VERY UPSETTING.

05:33.625 --> 05:36.041
- I KNOW.

05:41.500 --> 05:44.333
[phone rings]

05:49.834 --> 05:53.291
[ringing continues]

05:53.291 --> 05:55.208
- YOU WANT ME TO GET THAT?

05:55.208 --> 05:57.959
- YES, THAT HASN'T CHANGED!

05:57.959 --> 06:00.375
- SEAN AND BEVERLY'S OFFICE.

06:00.375 --> 06:03.583
EILEEN JAFFEE ON ONE.

06:03.583 --> 06:05.083
- HELLO.

06:05.083 --> 06:06.291
- HI, GUYS.
WELCOME BACK.

06:06.291 --> 06:08.166
DID YOU GET MY BASKET?

06:08.166 --> 06:09.417
- UH, I DON'T THINK SO.

06:09.417 --> 06:11.667
WENDY, DID WE GET A BASKET?

06:11.667 --> 06:12.625
- WHAT?

06:12.625 --> 06:13.667
- A BASKET.

06:13.667 --> 06:14.709
A GIFT BASKET.

06:14.709 --> 06:16.709
- FROM EILEEN JAFFEE.

06:16.709 --> 06:19.417
- YEAH.

06:19.417 --> 06:21.583
- CAN WE SEE IT?

06:21.583 --> 06:23.667
- NOT FROM THERE.

06:23.667 --> 06:25.875
- APPARENTLY WE DID GET IT.

06:25.875 --> 06:27.291
THANKS SO MUCH.

06:27.291 --> 06:29.667
- I'M JUST HAPPY
YOU GUYS ARE BACK.

06:29.667 --> 06:32.125
ANYWAY, WHILE I'VE GOT YOU,

06:32.125 --> 06:34.709
NOW DON'T BITE
MY HEAD OFF...

06:34.709 --> 06:36.083
- YES?

06:36.083 --> 06:37.458
- THE OPPOSITE OF US.

06:37.458 --> 06:39.000
- I HOPE YOU CAN BREATHE
THROUGH YOUR NECK.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.375
- [chuckles]

06:40.375 --> 06:44.041
I STILL HAVE THREE NETWORKS
CLAMORING FOR IT.

06:44.041 --> 06:45.083
CLAMORING.

06:45.083 --> 06:46.625
THEY NEVER CLAMOR.

06:46.625 --> 06:49.250
- WELL, THEY CAN CLAMOR
ALL THEY LIKE.

06:49.250 --> 06:50.959
- I JUST DON'T WANT YOU
TO LOOK BACK SOMEDAY

06:50.959 --> 06:52.417
AND KICK YOURSELVES.

06:52.417 --> 06:55.417
THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY
ON THE TABLE HERE.

06:55.417 --> 06:58.375
ALL I NEED IS FOR YOU
TO SAY "GO."

06:58.375 --> 07:01.583
SAY "GO" AND
I WILL MAKE IT HAPPEN.

07:01.583 --> 07:03.583
JUST SAY IT.

07:03.583 --> 07:06.667
JUST SAY "GO".

07:06.667 --> 07:07.959
- NO.

07:07.959 --> 07:09.750
- OH, MY GOD!

07:09.750 --> 07:10.875
- HE SAID "NO".

07:10.875 --> 07:12.083
- OH.

07:12.083 --> 07:15.583
IT SOUNDED SO MUCH
LIKE "GO".

07:19.250 --> 07:20.792
- I'LL HAVE THE NICOISE SALAD.

07:20.792 --> 07:22.500
- YEAH, GIVE ME
THE CHOPPED CHICKEN THING

07:22.500 --> 07:24.417
WITH THE ARTICHOKES.
IT'S NOT ON THE MENU.

07:24.417 --> 07:26.208
JUST TELL THE CHEF
IT'S FOR ME.

07:26.208 --> 07:28.917
- VERY GOOD.
- [giggles]

07:28.917 --> 07:31.250
SO HAVE YOU BEEN AWAY?

07:31.250 --> 07:32.583
YOU LOOK TAN.

07:32.583 --> 07:34.542
- IT'S JAUNDICE.
- WHAT?

07:34.542 --> 07:36.500
- JAUNDICE. THERE'S SOMETHING
SCREWED UP WITH MY LIVER.

07:36.500 --> 07:38.917
THEY DON'T KNOW.
THEY'RE RUNNING TESTS.

07:38.917 --> 07:40.458
- OH, MY GOD.

07:40.458 --> 07:43.667
WELL, HOPEFULLY
IT'S NOTHING SERIOUS.

07:43.667 --> 07:44.750
- I'M YELLOW.

07:44.750 --> 07:45.667
- RIGHT.

07:45.667 --> 07:49.417
WELL, ON YOU IT LOOKS GOOD.

07:49.417 --> 07:52.250
HA.
ANYWAY, UH...

07:52.250 --> 07:55.417
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR MAKING THE TIME.

07:55.417 --> 07:57.750
WE HAVEN'T REALLY TALKED
SINCE CASTOR LEFT.

07:57.750 --> 08:00.125
- DID YOU KNOW THEY FOUND
A LOADED GUN IN HIS DRAWER?

08:00.125 --> 08:03.333
- JESUS!
A LOADED GUN?

08:03.333 --> 08:05.709
- AND AN ETCH A SKETCH.
REMEMBER ETCH A SKETCH?

08:05.709 --> 08:07.667
- SURE.

08:07.667 --> 08:11.417
WELL, AT LEAST YOU CAN'T KILL
SOMEONE WITH AN ETCH A SKETCH.

08:11.417 --> 08:12.917
- YOU PROBABLY CAN.

08:12.917 --> 08:15.125
- MM.

08:15.125 --> 08:18.667
ANYWAY, I WANTED
TO TALK ABOUT THE JOB.

08:18.667 --> 08:20.625
I SHOULD NEVER
HAVE TURNED IT DOWN.

08:20.625 --> 08:22.792
I'VE REGRETTED IT
EVER SINCE.

08:22.792 --> 08:24.125
- I'LL BET.
[chuckles]

08:24.125 --> 08:25.667
- [chuckles]

08:25.667 --> 08:29.166
WELL, I HOPE NOW
YOU'LL RECONSIDER ME.

08:29.166 --> 08:30.375
- OKAY.

08:30.375 --> 08:32.333
- I THINK WE NEED
SOMEONE STRONG.

08:32.333 --> 08:35.166
SOMEONE WITH ENERGY,
WITH EXPERIENCE.

08:35.166 --> 08:36.667
- NO QUESTION.
- ALSO,

08:36.667 --> 08:39.834
THIS NETWORK HAS NEVER
HAD A WOMAN IN THAT JOB.

08:39.834 --> 08:41.625
DON'T YOU THINK IT WOULD--

08:41.625 --> 08:43.500
- WHAT ABOUT HELEN BASCH?

08:43.500 --> 08:45.208
- UH, WOW.

08:45.208 --> 08:47.500
HELEN'S GREAT, OBVIOUSLY.

08:47.500 --> 08:49.333
BUT I WAS THINKING--

08:49.333 --> 08:50.250
- NO, I KNOW,
YOU WERE SAYING YOU.

08:50.250 --> 08:51.500
BUT HELEN BASCH, COME ON.

08:51.500 --> 08:53.500
SHE'S GOT A HELL
OF A TRACK RECORD.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.000
- WELL, SURE.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.458
- WE NEED SOMEONE
WHO CAN TURN THIS MESS AROUND.

08:57.458 --> 08:59.667
SHE'S DONE IT BEFORE.

08:59.667 --> 09:02.000
- NO, TOTALLY.
IT'S A GREAT IDEA.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.041
- I KNOW.

09:03.041 --> 09:04.500
- I JUST, UH--

09:04.500 --> 09:07.417
I'D BE SHOCKED
IF WE COULD GET HER.

09:07.417 --> 09:09.834
I MEAN, WHY WOULD HELEN BASCH
WANT TO LEAVE--

09:09.834 --> 09:13.125
- 'CAUSE I'LL THROW
A SHITLOAD OF MONEY AT HER.

09:13.125 --> 09:15.041
- THAT SHOULD DO IT.

09:15.041 --> 09:17.667
- HELEN BASCH.

09:17.667 --> 09:19.166
I'M EXCITED.

09:19.166 --> 09:21.041
- ME TOO.

09:21.041 --> 09:22.208
LOVE IT.

09:22.208 --> 09:24.709
[chuckles]

09:24.709 --> 09:26.375
THE MINUTE HE SAID
"HELEN BASCH,"

09:26.375 --> 09:29.166
I KNEW, THAT'S IT,
I'M DEAD.

09:29.166 --> 09:31.458
I MEAN, HELEN BASCH.

09:31.458 --> 09:34.667
TRUST ME,
I AM OUT ON MY ASS.

09:34.667 --> 09:36.458
- WHICH IS LOOKING
VERY FIRM, BY THE WAY.

09:36.458 --> 09:37.792
- DOES IT?
- HMM.

09:37.792 --> 09:39.125
- ARE YOU JUST BEING NICE?

09:39.125 --> 09:40.834
- DOES THAT SOUND LIKE ME?

09:40.834 --> 09:41.917
- EH.

09:41.917 --> 09:43.083
YOU'LL SEE,

09:43.083 --> 09:44.417
IF SHE TAKES THE JOB,

09:44.417 --> 09:46.041
NO WAY SHE'S GONNA KEEP ME.

09:46.041 --> 09:48.291
- WHICH IS EXACTLY
WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT CASTOR,

09:48.291 --> 09:50.083
AND LOOK HOW WELL
THAT TURNED OUT.

09:50.083 --> 09:51.583
- YEAH, WELL,
THIS IS DIFFERENT.

09:51.583 --> 09:54.250
- HOW SO?

09:54.250 --> 09:56.083
- OKAY, DON'T JUDGE ME.

09:56.083 --> 09:57.291
- [chuckling]
OH!

09:57.291 --> 10:01.208
I THINK THAT SHIP SAILED
LONG AGO.

10:01.208 --> 10:02.917
- WHEN I FIRST STARTED OUT,

10:02.917 --> 10:05.750
I WORKED IN DAYTIME DRAMA
OVER AT ABC.

10:05.750 --> 10:08.875
- MM.
- AND I, UM...

10:08.875 --> 10:11.834
I KIND OF HAD A THING
WITH MY BOSS.

10:11.834 --> 10:14.041
- REALLY?
YOUR BOSS?

10:14.041 --> 10:16.542
THAT'S SO UNEXPECTED
AND OUT OF CHARACTER.

10:16.542 --> 10:19.875
- [mocking] MEH, MEH, MEH,
MEH, MEH, MEH, MEH, MEH, MEH.

10:19.875 --> 10:22.750
- ALL RIGHT.

10:22.750 --> 10:25.041
SO YOU'RE HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH YOUR BOSS

10:25.041 --> 10:28.792
IN DAYTIME DRAMA,
FITTINGLY.

10:28.792 --> 10:32.166
- THEN HIS STUPID WIFE
FOUND OUT.

10:32.166 --> 10:33.709
- HIS STUPID WIFE BEING...

10:33.709 --> 10:35.709
- YOU GOT IT!
- OH!

10:35.709 --> 10:37.625
- SHE WENT NUTS.

10:37.625 --> 10:39.625
MADE HIM BREAK UP WITH ME.

10:39.625 --> 10:41.083
MADE HIM FIRE ME.

10:41.083 --> 10:42.792
- SO NOT SO STUPID.

10:42.792 --> 10:46.041
- I SEE HER ALL THE TIME NOW
AT INDUSTRY THINGS.

10:46.041 --> 10:48.083
- OOH, THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

10:48.083 --> 10:50.625
- KNOW WHAT,
IT'S ACTUALLY FINE.

10:50.625 --> 10:52.291
SHE ACTS LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED.

10:52.291 --> 10:55.000
BUT COME ON,
I BROKE UP HER MARRIAGE.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.875
YOU THINK SHE'S GONNA
WANT ME AS HER NUMBER TWO?

10:57.875 --> 11:01.291
- WELL, SHE HASN'T
SAID YES YET.

11:01.291 --> 11:02.709
THERE'S STILL HOPE.

11:02.709 --> 11:04.875
- JUST IN CASE,
I'VE ALREADY STARTED LOOKING.

11:04.875 --> 11:06.583
- REALLY?
- YEAH!

11:06.583 --> 11:08.500
I GOTTA COVER MY ASS.

11:08.500 --> 11:10.500
YOU REALLY THINK
IT LOOKS GOOD?

11:10.500 --> 11:12.166
- BY THE WAY, WHERE ARE WE?

11:12.166 --> 11:16.041
- YOU'LL SEE.

11:16.041 --> 11:18.792
- SO WHEN YOU'RE
HAVING AN AFFAIR

11:18.792 --> 11:22.333
WITH THESE MARRIED MEN,
IS THERE ANY SENSE OF--

11:22.333 --> 11:23.250
- DANGER?

11:23.250 --> 11:24.667
- I WAS GONNA SAY REMORSE.

11:24.667 --> 11:27.250
- OH.

11:27.250 --> 11:30.792
ALL RIGHT,
THIS IS IT.

11:31.917 --> 11:34.834
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

11:39.125 --> 11:41.959
- I HATE THIS CITY.
- OKAY.

11:45.667 --> 11:49.000
[somber music]

11:49.000 --> 11:50.834
- I SAW HIM, LIKE,
TWO WEEKS AGO.

11:50.834 --> 11:53.083
WE HAD A TAX MEETING.

11:53.083 --> 11:55.208
HE SEEMED FINE.

11:55.208 --> 11:57.417
- THAT IS DEATH
IN A NUTSHELL.

11:57.417 --> 11:59.291
- HMM.

11:59.291 --> 12:02.709
- HEARTBREAKING.

12:02.709 --> 12:06.291
- OH, I KNOW.

12:06.291 --> 12:08.125
SHITTY TURNOUT.

12:08.125 --> 12:09.166
- HM.

12:09.166 --> 12:10.291
- WHERE'S TIM ALLEN?

12:10.291 --> 12:11.542
WHERE'S PHYLICIA RASHAD?

12:11.542 --> 12:12.917
THEY WERE WITH HIM
LONGER THAN ME.

12:12.917 --> 12:14.375
WHY AREN'T THEY HERE?

12:14.375 --> 12:16.291
- OBVIOUSLY, THEY'RE NOT
AS FORGIVING AS YOU.

12:16.291 --> 12:18.083
- WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

12:18.083 --> 12:20.375
- SERIOUSLY, YOU DIDN'T SEE
THE PAPER TODAY?

12:20.375 --> 12:21.291
- WHY, AM I IN IT?

12:21.291 --> 12:23.166
- UNFORTUNATELY.
- WHAT?

12:23.166 --> 12:24.709
- THE FBI'S BEEN
INVESTIGATING HIM

12:24.709 --> 12:27.333
FOR STEALING MONEY
FROM HIS CLIENTS.

12:27.333 --> 12:29.041
- LARRY?

12:29.041 --> 12:31.166
- APPARENTLY DEMI LOVATO
HAD HIM AUDITED.

12:31.166 --> 12:32.333
THAT'S HOW THEY FOUND OUT.

12:32.333 --> 12:34.250
- ARE YOU SHITTING ME?

12:34.250 --> 12:35.750
- WHY DO YOU THINK HE, UH...

12:35.750 --> 12:37.500
- JESUS CHRIST.

12:37.500 --> 12:38.959
- THAT'S WHY NOBODY'S HERE.

12:38.959 --> 12:42.458
FRANKLY, I'M SURPRISED
ARLENE CAME.

12:42.458 --> 12:44.250
HOW MUCH
DID YOU HAVE WITH HIM?

12:44.250 --> 12:46.417
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, HOW MUCH?
ALL OF IT.

12:46.417 --> 12:48.083
- OH, SHIT.

12:48.083 --> 12:50.166
MAYBE SOME OF IT'S LEFT.

12:50.166 --> 12:51.709
- SOME OF IT?

12:51.709 --> 12:53.417
- I'LL MAKE SOME CALLS AFTER,

12:53.417 --> 12:54.917
FIND OUT THE SPECIFICS.

12:54.917 --> 12:58.750
OR I'LL MAKE SOME CALLS NOW.

13:03.250 --> 13:04.834
- THIS IS CRAZY.

13:04.834 --> 13:07.083
HE USED TO SAY
HE THOUGHT OF ME AS FAMILY.

13:07.083 --> 13:08.375
- HE ALSO WIPED OUT
HIS SISTER ZOEY,

13:08.375 --> 13:10.417
AND SHE'S ACTUALLY FAMILY.

13:10.417 --> 13:12.375
- FUCK!

13:13.667 --> 13:15.750
HEY, DON'T YOU HAVE
YOUR MONEY WITH HIM?

13:15.750 --> 13:19.125
- EH, I DUMPED LARRY
SIX YEARS AGO.

13:19.125 --> 13:21.250
I JUST DIDN'T HAVE
A GOOD FEELING.

13:21.250 --> 13:23.166
- THANKS FOR THE HEADS-UP.

13:23.166 --> 13:25.458
- WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
PROFESSIONAL.

13:25.458 --> 13:27.083
IS HE IN?

13:27.083 --> 13:29.750
SANFORD SHAMIRO.

13:29.750 --> 13:32.458
- MOTHERFUCKING
SON OF A BITCH.

13:32.458 --> 13:33.875
- MAY HE REST IN PEACE.

13:33.875 --> 13:36.500
- WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON?

13:36.500 --> 13:41.458
- WE ARE ALL EXPERIENCING
A RANGE OF EMOTIONS TODAY.

13:41.458 --> 13:47.291
SADNESS OVER THE LOSS OF
SOMEONE SO GIFTED AND LOVING.

13:47.291 --> 13:51.291
CONFUSION OVER THE CHOICES
THAT HE MADE.

13:51.291 --> 13:54.333
- ASK HIM ABOUT THE EQUITY
ACCOUNT IN THE BOYS' NAMES.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.333
- HE WANTS TO KNOW ABOUT
THE EQUITY ACCOUNT

13:56.333 --> 13:58.375
IN THE BOYS' NAMES.

13:58.375 --> 14:01.083
- REMIND ME.
- AIDEN AND MICHAEL.

14:01.083 --> 14:04.458
- AIDEN AND MICHAEL.
[rabbi continues in background]

14:04.458 --> 14:05.667
NO, THAT'S GONE TOO.

14:05.667 --> 14:07.417
- GOD DAMN IT.

14:07.417 --> 14:08.917
HOW ABOUT THE--

14:08.917 --> 14:12.208
- I'M GONNA PUT YOU
ON WITH HIM.

14:12.208 --> 14:15.208
- OKAY, THERE'S A FIXED
INCOME MANAGEMENT ACCOUNT.

14:15.208 --> 14:18.041
I FORGET THE COMPANY,
IT'S THREE LETTERS.

14:18.041 --> 14:20.041
YEAH, THAT'S IT.

14:20.041 --> 14:23.667
OH, COME ON.

14:23.667 --> 14:26.500
[somber music]

14:26.500 --> 14:34.625
â™ª â™ª

14:35.333 --> 14:37.625
WELL, IT'S GONE.

14:37.625 --> 14:40.250
JUST FUCKING GONE.

14:40.250 --> 14:41.375
- UNBELIEVABLE.

14:41.375 --> 14:43.834
- YOU HAD NO IDEA
THE WHOLE TIME?

14:45.542 --> 14:47.417
RIGHT, OBVIOUSLY.
SORRY.

14:47.417 --> 14:49.000
- IT'S HEARTBREAKING.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.375
YOU TRUSTED HIM
ALL THOSE YEARS.

14:51.375 --> 14:54.125
- UP UNTIL ABOUT 11:30 TODAY.

14:54.125 --> 14:57.583
- YOU MUST FEEL SO BETRAYED.

14:57.583 --> 14:58.750
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT I FEEL.

14:58.750 --> 15:02.333
IT'S LIKE, I DON'T KNOW...

15:02.333 --> 15:03.917
I'VE NEVER BEEN RAPED.

15:03.917 --> 15:06.750
- WELL, DON'T LOOK AT ME.
I'VE NEVER BEEN RAPED.

15:09.291 --> 15:10.709
- WHAT?

15:10.709 --> 15:14.166
- I DON'T KNOW...
BOARDING SCHOOL?

15:17.417 --> 15:19.583
- UGH.

15:19.583 --> 15:23.583
IT'S LIKE THE BOTTOM
JUST DROPPED OUT.

15:23.583 --> 15:28.709
LIKE MY WHOLE LIFE
AFTER TODAY IS...

15:31.291 --> 15:32.792
[sighs]

15:32.792 --> 15:35.041
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

15:36.917 --> 15:38.750
- I KNOW IT'S
A MEANINGLESS CLICHE,

15:38.750 --> 15:41.667
BUT IT IS JUST MONEY.

15:41.667 --> 15:44.750
YOU STILL HAVE YOUR HEALTH,
YOUR CHILDREN.

15:44.750 --> 15:46.542
- NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

15:46.542 --> 15:48.542
IT'S A MEANINGLESS CLICHE.

15:52.083 --> 15:54.542
HOW DID THIS FUCKING HAPPEN?

15:54.542 --> 15:55.792
I DON'T DESERVE THIS.

15:55.792 --> 15:57.875
I'M A GOOD PERSON.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.166
- I DON'T KNOW THAT
IT'S ABOUT GOOD OR BAD PER SE.

16:04.166 --> 16:06.834
- YOU GO ALONG
THINKING EVERYTHING'S GREAT.

16:06.834 --> 16:10.291
I MEAN, NOT THE STUPID SHOW.

16:10.291 --> 16:11.709
- SURE.
- RIGHT.

16:11.709 --> 16:13.125
- THEN YOU WAKE UP ONE DAY,

16:13.125 --> 16:16.333
AND HALF YOUR MONEY'S GONE.
JUST--JUST GONE.

16:16.333 --> 16:18.417
- WAIT, I'M SORRY.
SAY WHAT?

16:18.417 --> 16:19.333
- WHAT?

16:19.333 --> 16:20.458
- YOU SAID HALF?

16:20.458 --> 16:21.500
HALF YOUR MONEY'S GONE?

16:21.500 --> 16:22.875
- YEAH.

16:22.875 --> 16:24.542
- OH.

16:24.542 --> 16:27.208
YOU MADE IT SOUND LIKE
HE TOOK EVERYTHING.

16:27.208 --> 16:28.625
DIDN'T YOU THINK?
- I DID, YEAH.

16:28.625 --> 16:31.750
- WELL,
IF IT'S NOT EVERYTHING...

16:31.750 --> 16:35.792
- HE STOLE $32 MILLION
FROM ME.

16:35.792 --> 16:37.667
- IT'S INSANE.
UNBELIEVABLE.

16:37.667 --> 16:40.458
- NO, THAT'S A RIDICULOUS
AMOUNT OF MONEY, OF COURSE.

16:40.458 --> 16:44.542
BUT YOU STILL HAVE...

16:44.542 --> 16:48.125
- UH, A LITTLE OVER 31.

16:50.458 --> 16:51.959
WHAT?

16:51.959 --> 16:53.542
- NOTHING.

16:53.542 --> 16:55.083
- WHAT?
- UM...

16:55.083 --> 16:57.500
I DON'T WANT TO DIMINISH
WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH

16:57.500 --> 16:58.333
IN ANY WAY...

16:58.333 --> 16:59.750
- BUT?

16:59.750 --> 17:03.291
- BUT IT DOES SEEM
SLIGHTLY LESS...

17:03.291 --> 17:04.667
DIRE.

17:04.667 --> 17:07.375
- I LOST $32 MILLION.

17:07.375 --> 17:08.875
- ABSOLUTELY.

17:08.875 --> 17:11.458
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS
YOU STILL HAVE 31.

17:11.458 --> 17:14.208
- BUT THE BAD NEWS IS
I LOST 32.

17:14.208 --> 17:15.291
- RIGHT, I GET IT.

17:15.291 --> 17:16.542
- I DON'T THINK YOU DO.

17:16.542 --> 17:18.000
TO BE CLEAR,

17:18.000 --> 17:25.041
I LOST 32 MILLION
FUCKING DOLLARS.

17:25.041 --> 17:26.625
- YEAH, NO, THAT'S
AN UNBELIEVABLE LOT.

17:26.625 --> 17:28.333
- I MEAN,
IT'S INCONCEIVABLE JUST--

17:36.583 --> 17:38.458
- BUT YOU STILL HAVE 31.

17:38.458 --> 17:39.542
- I SWEAR TO GOD--

17:39.542 --> 17:40.542
- LISTEN TO ME,

17:40.542 --> 17:41.709
YOU HAVE SUFFERED
A TERRIBLE,

17:41.709 --> 17:43.542
TERRIBLE LOSS.

17:43.542 --> 17:44.834
- YOU THINK?

17:44.834 --> 17:46.792
- BUT YOU WILL BE ALL RIGHT.

17:46.792 --> 17:48.500
- [scoffs]
- YOU WILL!

17:48.500 --> 17:49.834
YOU CAN HAVE A VERY NICE LIFE,

17:49.834 --> 17:55.750
EVEN WITH AS LITTLE
AS $31 MILLION.

17:55.750 --> 17:57.291
- I--I DON'T SEE HOW.

17:57.291 --> 17:59.041
- LET'S SAY
YOU NEVER MAKE ANOTHER DIME.

17:59.041 --> 18:03.083
YOU CAN STILL LIVE
ON A MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR.

18:03.083 --> 18:05.667
- NO, YOU  COULD LIVE
ON A MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR.

18:05.667 --> 18:06.917
- I'M SURE I COULD.

18:06.917 --> 18:09.417
- SO A MILLION A YEAR.

18:09.417 --> 18:14.583
THAT MEANS I'D HAVE TO DIE
BEFORE I'M 80.

18:14.583 --> 18:15.750
- I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.

18:15.750 --> 18:16.667
[knock at door]

18:16.667 --> 18:18.083
- YEAH? WHAT?

18:18.083 --> 18:20.000
- MATT, WE'RE READY TO SHOOT.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.917
- FINE, LET'S DO
THIS FUCKING THING.

18:22.917 --> 18:25.500
- ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE UP FOR THIS?

18:25.500 --> 18:27.041
- WHY NOT?

18:27.041 --> 18:28.875
- I'D SAY YOU'RE
SIGNIFICANTLY DRUNK.

18:28.875 --> 18:31.542
- PSSH, YOU'VE NEVER
SEEN ME DRUNK.

18:31.542 --> 18:33.750
- YOU VOMITED ON ME.

18:33.750 --> 18:35.250
- I DON'T RECALL THAT.

18:42.875 --> 18:44.709
- HOW ARE WE ONLY NOW

18:44.709 --> 18:47.375
FINDING OUT PEOPLE THINK
THIS IS RACIST?

18:47.375 --> 18:50.208
RESEARCH HAS HAD THIS TITLE
FOR SIX MONTHS.

18:50.208 --> 18:52.458
- I STILL THINK IT'S CLEVER.

18:52.458 --> 18:54.625
- APPARENTLY AMERICA
DISAGREES WITH YOU.

18:54.625 --> 18:56.125
- ONLY 46%.

18:56.125 --> 18:59.125
- I'M SORRY,
WHY IS IT RACIST?

18:59.125 --> 19:01.166
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE WE
CALLED IT "WHITE AND WONG."

19:01.166 --> 19:03.625
- I STILL LIKE THAT ONE.

19:03.625 --> 19:06.083
MAYBE I DON'T KNOW
WHAT RACIST IS.

19:06.083 --> 19:08.875
- OH, MY GOD,
HAVE YOU GUYS HEARD?

19:08.875 --> 19:11.125
- WHERE DID YOU RUN FROM?

19:11.125 --> 19:13.500
- MY OFFICE. IT'S NEWS.
I'M BREATHLESS.

19:13.500 --> 19:16.792
WE JUST HIRED HELEN BASCH.

19:16.792 --> 19:18.917
- DEFINITELY?
- MM-HMM.

19:18.917 --> 19:21.000
- YEAH, IT SAYS
STARTING NEXT WEEK.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.667
- "A MAJOR GET
FOR THE FAILING NETWORK."

19:23.667 --> 19:25.667
- OH, MY GOD, HELEN BASCH.

19:25.667 --> 19:27.834
- SHE'S SUPPOSED
TO BE FANTASTIC.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.792
[overlapping chatter]

19:36.625 --> 19:38.709
- SERIOUSLY?
- WHAT?

19:38.709 --> 19:40.792
- YOU'RE NOT REALLY
BRINGING THAT ONTO THE STAGE?

19:40.792 --> 19:42.000
- WHY NOT?

19:42.000 --> 19:44.166
- YOU REEK
OF PROFESSIONALISM.

19:44.166 --> 19:45.709
- 32 MILLION!

19:48.709 --> 19:50.000
- SO I TOOK HIM TO THE VET,

19:50.000 --> 19:51.959
AND, YOU KNOW,
THEY SAID IT'S CANCER.

19:51.959 --> 19:55.625
SO $3,000 LATER, YOU KNOW,
HE'S STILL DYING, SO...

19:55.625 --> 19:57.083
- YEAH.

19:57.083 --> 19:59.000
- AT FIRST THEY THINK
IT'S FELINE AIDS,

19:59.000 --> 20:00.542
WHICH, YOU KNOW,
WOULD HAVE BEEN A BLESSING.

20:00.542 --> 20:02.667
BUT IT'S CANCER,
SO THAT'S IT.

20:02.667 --> 20:03.709
- REHEARSAL UP!

20:03.709 --> 20:07.959
- LISTEN,
MATT IS A LITTLE...

20:07.959 --> 20:09.792
AND I SUSPECT HE'S
NOT GONNA GET ANY LESS SO.

20:09.792 --> 20:11.208
- NO.

20:11.208 --> 20:12.917
- SO WE SHOULD PROBABLY
SKIP THE REHEARSAL

20:12.917 --> 20:14.667
AND SHOOT THIS
AS SOON AS WE CAN.

20:14.667 --> 20:16.875
- OKAY, JUST GIVE US A FEW
MINUTES TO FINISH LIGHTING,

20:16.875 --> 20:19.625
OKAY?
[clattering]

20:19.625 --> 20:21.667
- MY BAD.

20:24.709 --> 20:27.709
- ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME?
- WHAT?

20:27.709 --> 20:29.000
- WE'RE REALLY GONNA SHOOT
WITH HIM LIKE THIS?

20:29.000 --> 20:31.166
- HE'LL BE FINE.

20:31.166 --> 20:33.208
- OH, YEAH?

20:33.208 --> 20:34.875
HAVE YOU SMELLED
HIS BIG GULP?

20:34.875 --> 20:36.625
IT'S LIKE 30 OUNCES
OF REHAB.

20:36.625 --> 20:40.208
- THERE ARE EXTENUATING
CIRCUMSTANCES.

20:40.208 --> 20:42.834
- LOOK, I GET THAT HE LOST
ALL HIS MONEY.

20:42.834 --> 20:44.083
- HALF.

20:44.083 --> 20:45.041
- HALF?

20:45.041 --> 20:46.500
- THANK YOU.

20:46.500 --> 20:48.041
- BUT YOU KNOW WHAT,
THERE'S STILL NO EXCUSE.

20:48.041 --> 20:49.875
YOU DON'T SHOW UP
FOR WORK LIKE THIS.

20:49.875 --> 20:55.250
I HAVE BEEN IN THIS BUSINESS
FOR ALMOST FOURT--FOREVER.

20:55.250 --> 20:57.583
AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN
THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR.

20:57.583 --> 20:58.959
I'LL TELL YOU,

20:58.959 --> 21:00.750
IF AN ACTOR SHOWED UP LIKE THIS
ON KELLY GIRL...

21:00.750 --> 21:01.917
- ON WHAT?

21:01.917 --> 21:03.667
- DOES NO ONE REMEMBER
MY FUCKING SHOW?

21:03.667 --> 21:06.083
- I DO.

21:07.333 --> 21:09.125
- [sighs]

21:09.125 --> 21:12.166
LOOK, I REALIZE NOBODY'S EVER
GONNA SEE THESE SHOWS,

21:12.166 --> 21:14.709
BUT CAN WE AT LEAST PRETEND
THIS MATTERS.

21:14.709 --> 21:16.625
I HAD TO GIVE UP
A PILOT FOR THIS SHIT.

21:16.625 --> 21:18.500
THE LEAST HE CAN DO
IS SET AN EXAMPLE.

21:18.500 --> 21:19.917
IT'S CALLED
A FUCKING WORK ETHIC.

21:19.917 --> 21:21.083
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

21:21.083 --> 21:22.750
- HI, BOO.

21:22.750 --> 21:24.542
WE WERE JUST
TALKING ABOUT YOU.

21:24.542 --> 21:26.750
I WAS SAYING IN ALL THE YEARS
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS,

21:26.750 --> 21:29.291
I'VE NEVER SEEN
A WORK ETHIC LIKE YOURS.

21:29.291 --> 21:31.000
- [belches]

21:31.000 --> 21:33.834
- ANYWAY, SORRY ABOUT
THE LARRY PENZEL THING.

21:33.834 --> 21:34.792
JESUS.

21:34.792 --> 21:36.458
- UGH, TELL ME.

21:36.458 --> 21:38.458
- YOU KNOW, LARRY WAS
MY MONEY GUY FOR YEARS.

21:38.458 --> 21:39.458
- WAS?

21:39.458 --> 21:41.125
- OH, I GOT OUT
A WHILE AGO.

21:41.125 --> 21:43.625
I DON'T KNOW,
I JUST HAD A FEELING.

21:43.625 --> 21:45.208
- GOD DAMN IT!

21:45.208 --> 21:48.333
AM I THE ONLY ONE
WHO DIDN'T HAVE A FEELING?

21:48.333 --> 21:50.917
- JESUS FUCKING CHRIST.

21:50.917 --> 21:52.750
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

21:52.750 --> 21:55.291
I GOT THREE GODDAMN
ALIMONIES TO PAY.

21:55.291 --> 21:57.834
THIS IS WORSE THAN WHEN
I HAD BALL CANCER.

21:57.834 --> 21:59.542
- WELL, IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL ANY BETTER,

21:59.542 --> 22:02.458
MATT LEBLANC LOST 32 MILLION.

22:03.875 --> 22:05.875
- OH.

22:05.875 --> 22:08.250
HUH.

22:12.959 --> 22:15.166
- MAY I JUST SAY...
- HMM?

22:15.166 --> 22:18.125
- EATING YOUR FEELINGS
IS NOT THE ANSWER.

22:18.125 --> 22:21.000
- OH, I FINISHED MY FEELINGS
A LONG TIME AGO.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.875
I'M EATING
YOUR FEELINGS NOW.

22:22.875 --> 22:25.709
- LOOK, UM, I KNOW
YOU DON'T WANNA HEAR THIS,

22:25.709 --> 22:28.625
BUT YOU ARE STILL
A VERY WEALTHY MAN.

22:28.625 --> 22:30.208
- MM, I DON'T WANNA HEAR IT.

22:30.208 --> 22:32.208
- I'M SORRY,
BUT YOU STILL HAVE THIRTY--

22:32.208 --> 22:34.333
- DON'T SAY 31.
DON'T SAY 31.

22:34.333 --> 22:36.667
- LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

22:36.667 --> 22:39.083
MM.

22:39.083 --> 22:42.458
- HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED
THE OPTION OF SMALLER BITES?

22:44.834 --> 22:46.333
- MM.

22:51.959 --> 22:53.166
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

22:53.166 --> 22:54.917
WHAT IF YOU LOST
HALF YOUR MONEY?

22:54.917 --> 22:56.333
- IT'S TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

22:56.333 --> 22:58.333
- WHY?
HOW MUCH DO YOU GUYS HAVE?

22:58.333 --> 23:00.750
[both laugh]
- I'D RATHER NOT SAY.

23:00.750 --> 23:03.083
- TOLD YOU HOW MUCH I HAVE.
COME ON, JUST BALLPARK.

23:03.083 --> 23:04.250
- NO.
- IT'S IN POUNDS.

23:04.250 --> 23:06.208
I WON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT IT MEANS.

23:06.208 --> 23:07.542
- LET'S JUST SAY IT'S
A LOT LESS THAN 31 MILLION.

23:07.542 --> 23:09.166
- WELL, I FIGURED THAT.

23:09.166 --> 23:11.166
SO, LIKE, WHAT, 10?

23:11.166 --> 23:12.458
- 10? NO!

23:12.458 --> 23:15.041
- 5?
- IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS!

23:15.041 --> 23:16.375
- I'M TALKING COMBINED.

23:16.375 --> 23:18.959
THE TWO OF YOU COMBINED
HAVE LESS THAN 5?

23:18.959 --> 23:21.083
- WE'RE NOT TELLING YOU.

23:21.083 --> 23:23.709
- OKAY, STOP ME WHEN I'M CLOSE.
4.

23:23.709 --> 23:25.250
3?

23:25.250 --> 23:27.208
2?
- STOP.

23:27.208 --> 23:28.959
- OKAY, SO YOU HAVE 2.

23:28.959 --> 23:30.208
- NO, JUST STOP.

23:30.208 --> 23:32.041
- COME ON, YOU GOTTA
HAVE AT LEAST 2.

23:32.041 --> 23:32.959
YOU HAD A HIT SHOW.

23:32.959 --> 23:34.709
- IN ENGLAND.

23:34.709 --> 23:36.625
- IT'S STILL A COUNTRY.

23:36.625 --> 23:38.417
CHRIST, LESS THAN 2?

23:38.417 --> 23:40.166
1?

23:40.166 --> 23:42.834
OH, MY GOD,
LESS THAN 1?

23:42.834 --> 23:44.834
FUCK.

23:44.834 --> 23:48.458
DO YOU NEED MONEY?
- NO, WE DON'T NEED MONEY.

23:48.458 --> 23:49.834
- I AM VERY CONCERNED FOR YOU.

23:49.834 --> 23:51.959
- THANK YOU.
WE'RE FINE.

23:51.959 --> 23:53.750
- YOU'RE NOT FINE.

23:53.750 --> 23:55.667
YOU GOT NO MONEY.

23:55.667 --> 23:57.917
YOU NEED SECURITY.

23:57.917 --> 23:59.583
YOU'RE NOT THAT YOUNG.

23:59.583 --> 24:01.083
- YOUNGER THAN YOU.

24:01.083 --> 24:03.083
- REALLY?
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

24:03.083 --> 24:04.792
- NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

24:04.792 --> 24:06.083
- MORE THAN 40?

24:06.083 --> 24:07.250
- ALL RIGHT,
YOU'RE DRUNK,

24:07.250 --> 24:08.583
AND THIS CONVERSATION
IS OVER.

24:08.583 --> 24:10.500
- YES, I AM,
AND, NO, IT'S NOT.

24:10.500 --> 24:12.750
YOU--YOU GOT NO SAVINGS.

24:12.750 --> 24:16.375
YOU WANT THE LIGHTS TO
STILL GO ON WHEN YOU'RE 70?

24:16.375 --> 24:17.500
YOU SHOULD BE WORRIED.

24:17.500 --> 24:19.709
VERY WORRIED.

24:19.709 --> 24:20.792
- WHAT?

24:20.792 --> 24:22.208
- SHOULD WE BE WORRIED?

24:22.208 --> 24:23.667
- NO!

24:23.667 --> 24:25.625
YOU'RE TAKING
FINANCIAL ADVICE FROM A MAN

24:25.625 --> 24:27.709
WHO IS LITERALLY
SLOSHING WHILE HE WALKS.

24:27.709 --> 24:29.291
- STILL...

24:29.291 --> 24:31.667
- SWEETHEART, 31 MILLION
ISN'T ENOUGH FOR HIM.

24:31.667 --> 24:34.125
- YOU KNOW WHAT ISN'T ENOUGH?
LESS THAN 1.

24:34.125 --> 24:35.750
- MAYBE WE SHOULD THINK
ABOUT DOING THE OTHER THING.

24:35.750 --> 24:38.291
- DARLING, DON'T--
- WHAT OTHER THING?

24:38.291 --> 24:39.792
- THAT SCRIPT EVERYONE WANTS.

24:39.792 --> 24:41.458
- HOW IS THAT EVEN A QUESTION?

24:41.458 --> 24:42.667
- WILL YOU PLEASE
STAY OUT OF THIS?

24:42.667 --> 24:44.125
- NO, DO IT.
CASH IN.

24:44.125 --> 24:45.583
- STOP FOLLOWING US.

24:45.583 --> 24:47.458
- YOU THINK IT'S ALWAYS
GONNA BE LIKE THIS?

24:47.458 --> 24:49.458
OH, SURE, TELEVISION WRITERS.

24:49.458 --> 24:52.166
WHEN YOU GET OLD, THAT'S WHEN
THE BIG BUCKS START ROLLING IN.

24:52.166 --> 24:53.458
- DON'T LET HIM DO THIS.

24:53.458 --> 24:55.291
WE HAVE NEVER WORRIED
ABOUT MONEY.

24:55.291 --> 24:56.792
- WHICH IS WHY
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY.

24:56.792 --> 24:57.834
- ARE WE BEING STUPID?

24:57.834 --> 24:59.417
- YES!
- NO!

24:59.417 --> 25:01.208
NO MONEY IS WORTH
GOING THROUGH THIS AGAIN.

25:01.208 --> 25:02.333
- I DON'T KNOW.

25:02.333 --> 25:04.250
- SLOW DOWN!

25:04.250 --> 25:06.291
- WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?

25:06.291 --> 25:08.333
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL SAY ONE THING,

25:08.333 --> 25:10.375
AND THEN I'LL DROP IT.

25:10.375 --> 25:11.500
- I BET YOU DON'T.

25:11.500 --> 25:12.542
- HI, MATT.

25:12.542 --> 25:14.709
- YOU--UH--MM--

25:14.709 --> 25:17.375
LET'S SAY YOU NEVER SELL
ANOTHER SHOW.

25:17.375 --> 25:20.333
YOU DON'T MAKE
ANY MORE AFTER THIS.

25:20.333 --> 25:21.667
HOW YOU GONNA LIVE?

25:21.667 --> 25:23.709
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

25:23.709 --> 25:25.834
GO HOME,
OPEN A LITTLE SHOP...

25:25.834 --> 25:27.333
SELLING JOKES?

25:27.333 --> 25:29.458
[English accent]
JOKES. I'VE GOT JOKES.

25:29.458 --> 25:32.333
JOKE, SIR?
PENNY FOR A JOKE.

25:32.333 --> 25:33.333
- BLOODY HELL!

25:33.333 --> 25:34.667
- I'M SERIOUS.

25:34.667 --> 25:38.291
MY GRANDFATHER WAS STILL
DRIVING A LAUNDRY TRUCK

25:38.291 --> 25:41.458
TWO DAYS BEFORE HIS FUNERAL.

25:41.458 --> 25:44.041
YOU WANNA RETIRE SOMEDAY?

25:44.041 --> 25:45.750
YOU GOTTA MAKE
YOUR MONEY NOW.

25:45.750 --> 25:49.750
- OKAY, MONEY, FINE.
BUT NOT HERE.

25:49.750 --> 25:51.834
- HERE IS WHERE YOU MAKE
THE MONEY.

25:51.834 --> 25:53.834
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

25:53.834 --> 25:54.959
IT WAS TOO HARD?

25:54.959 --> 25:56.542
THEY CHANGED YOUR LITTLE SHOW?

25:56.542 --> 25:58.625
THEY DON'T RESPECT
YOUR TALENT?

25:58.625 --> 26:01.000
THAT'S WHY THEY PAY YOU
SO MUCH!

26:01.000 --> 26:03.458
- STOP TALKING.
OOH--AHH!

26:03.458 --> 26:05.291
DID YOU JUST LICK ME?
HE LICKED ME!

26:05.291 --> 26:07.083
- CALM DOWN.
- YOU'RE A MONSTER!

26:07.083 --> 26:11.834
- YEAH, WELL, SOMETIMES
THE MONSTER IS RIGHT.

26:13.166 --> 26:15.041
DON'T BE STUPID.

26:16.375 --> 26:17.709
CALL YOUR AGENT.

26:17.709 --> 26:20.166
SELL YOUR SHOW.
MAKE THE MONEY.

26:27.208 --> 26:28.875
- I'M SORRY.

26:30.417 --> 26:32.792
THE MONSTER IS RIGHT.

26:35.875 --> 26:37.583
- SEAN LINCOLN ON ONE.

26:37.583 --> 26:40.583
- HI, HONEY.

26:40.583 --> 26:43.125
- IT'S...GO.

26:43.125 --> 26:45.959
- OH, MY GOD!

26:45.959 --> 26:50.041
- I MADE UP THE PART
ABOUT MY GRANDFATHER.

26:51.792 --> 26:54.667
[upbeat music]

26:54.667 --> 27:02.625
