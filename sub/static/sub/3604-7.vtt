Mom,

16:48.800 --> 16:50.210
please don't.

16:50.302 --> 16:51.917
Claire, he loves you.

16:52.012 --> 16:53.752
I know.

16:54.097 --> 16:57.635
But there is something
inside of me
and it's broken.

16:57.767 --> 17:02.602
And he can't fix it.
I think I'm the only one
who can.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.607
Do you understand that?

17:07.694 --> 17:10.026
Do you really think
you can trust Elle?

17:10.113 --> 17:11.478
No.

17:11.948 --> 17:13.233
But we both want
the same thing.

17:13.325 --> 17:17.034
We need our abilities
under control.

Daphne,
what are you doing?

17:48.318 --> 17:53.028
They think that I told you
not to come to Pinehearst,
that I warned you away.

17:53.156 --> 17:54.942
They don't believe
I'm one of them.
Well, you're not.

17:55.033 --> 17:58.196
Shut up.
If I don't kill you,
they'll kill me.

Shoot me.

the only way that I can
save your life, do it.

that I'm worth saving,

18:12.175 --> 18:14.086
but I've done
some bad things.

18:14.177 --> 18:15.792
Yeah, but you
make up for all that
in the future.

18:15.887 --> 18:20.347
I don't have a future
unless I kill you,
so turn around.

he's helping me.

all a mistake.

31:28.721 --> 31:30.131
For helping me.

31:31.557 --> 31:33.718
I've been nothing but a bitCh,
and you've been nothing
but sweet.

31:33.809 --> 31:35.515
Really, itjust makes me
hate you more.

31:35.603 --> 31:38.185
No, I should
be the one
thanking you.

31:38.314 --> 31:41.727
Why?
Because I was
ready to give up,

31:41.817 --> 31:45.275
stay home, deny everything
that's been happening to me.

31:46.781 --> 31:47.987
I was scared.

31:49.158 --> 31:51.023
Scared of what?

31:51.118 --> 31:53.609
What I would find out
about who I really am.

31:53.704 --> 31:57.822
It's just... It's nice
to know that you're
as messed up as I am.

32:04.173 --> 32:06.630
Peter, you stayed?
I wasn't gonna leave you.

32:06.717 --> 32:08.582
What are you doing
sitting here?
Did he take your powers?

32:08.677 --> 32:09.712
No, he told me the truth.

32:09.804 --> 32:11.419
You can't listen to him.

32:11.514 --> 32:13.470
He's our father.
He's my father.
I grew up with him.

32:13.557 --> 32:16.424
And I didn't, so I don't get
the right to know him?
Is that what you're saying?

32:16.519 --> 32:19.807
He can't be trusted.
You've seen what he's done.

32:19.897 --> 32:23.481
He hurt mom.
He's manipulated abilities.
I know where that leads.

32:23.567 --> 32:26.980
The world you saw
doesn't exist.
We won't let it.

32:27.071 --> 32:29.153
I'm sorry, Peter,
this is something
I have to do.

32:29.240 --> 32:31.606
If you help him, you're
proving the worst things
I've said about you.

32:31.700 --> 32:33.782
Just kiCk his ass,
and let's get out of here.

32:33.869 --> 32:37.282
Oh, I'm not going anywhere,
Peter. You are.

32:47.216 --> 32:48.877
(PETER GROANING)

32:49.760 --> 32:52.467
Oh, my God,
Peter! Peter!

32:54.974 --> 32:56.009
What are you doing here?

32:56.100 --> 32:57.886
Why are you bleeding?

32:57.977 --> 32:59.558
He's not healing.

32:59.645 --> 33:02.057
He took my ability.
We need to go.

33:04.108 --> 33:06.315
(GRUNTING) Elle,
help me get him
in the car.

33:07.987 --> 33:10.945
Claire, did you hear
what he said?

33:11.031 --> 33:14.194
That they took his ability,
that's what we came here for.

33:14.285 --> 33:16.241
You don't know
what happened up there.

33:17.913 --> 33:20.074
I'm sorry, Claire.
Elle.

33:22.751 --> 33:24.207
(PETER GROANING)

33:25.212 --> 33:28.625
You can't heal.
How did you fall
that far and not die?

33:28.716 --> 33:30.206
I don't know.

33:31.886 --> 33:34.218
TRACY: Okay, let me
get this straight.

33:34.305 --> 33:37.138
She's the biological mother
of your illegitimate daughter,

33:37.224 --> 33:39.966
and he's her
adopted father.

33:40.060 --> 33:42.267
That sounds about right.

33:45.566 --> 33:47.682
Did Suresh inject you
with anything?

33:47.776 --> 33:49.732
Yeah, a tranquilizer, why?

33:50.779 --> 33:52.155
What's he doing in there?

33:52.239 --> 33:56.357
Building a nest,
laying eggs.
Who the hell knows?

33:56.452 --> 33:58.443
You're both gonna have
to come in to the Company
to be tested.

33:58.537 --> 33:59.526
For what?

33:59.622 --> 34:02.079
Just to be sure
you're still normal.

34:19.058 --> 34:20.639
So, you working with him?

34:20.809 --> 34:22.015
For now.

34:22.102 --> 34:23.262
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

34:23.354 --> 34:26.141
Excuse me. Petrelli.

34:31.070 --> 34:32.776
I'd watch out for that one.

34:32.988 --> 34:34.774
We're not together.

34:35.741 --> 34:36.730
Oh.

34:38.410 --> 34:39.741
Claire?

34:41.538 --> 34:44.200
Slow down. Slow down.
Where are you?

34:45.876 --> 34:47.537
No, I won't tell anyone.

34:49.922 --> 34:52.083
Peter's never gonna
give up, you know.

34:52.174 --> 34:56.918
I would expect
nothing less of a Petrelli.
Revenge is in our blood.

34:58.764 --> 35:00.675
Are we just
gonna wait for him
to come after us?

35:00.766 --> 35:04.054
No, Son. We're gonna take
our fight to the enemy.

35:06.438 --> 35:09.646
How do you suppose
Peter survived that fall?

35:09.733 --> 35:12.850
Seven stories without
the ability to heal.

35:13.737 --> 35:15.273
Hell ofa thing.

35:17.992 --> 35:19.482
I don't know.

35:19.576 --> 35:21.112
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

35:23.247 --> 35:24.612
Hello?

35:24.707 --> 35:28.040
DAPHNE: It worked.
He thinks I’m on his side.

35:28.127 --> 35:29.412
Good job.

35:29.503 --> 35:32.666
If he reaches out
to Primatech, I’ll let
you know what they say.

35:33.632 --> 35:38.501
Screw this up and
I'll put you right baCk
where I found you.

36:01.827 --> 36:06.412
I keep thinking about
that fall, how I didn't hit
as hard as I should have.

36:08.667 --> 36:10.077
What if Sylar didn't
want me to die?

36:10.169 --> 36:13.252
What if he wanted
to get me out
of there alive?

36:13.339 --> 36:15.170
By throwing you
out of a window?

36:15.257 --> 36:17.748
He could've
used his ability
to slow me down.

36:19.386 --> 36:21.763
I'm telling you,
he saved my life,
Claire.

36:23.223 --> 36:24.508
NATHAN: Claire.

36:30.397 --> 36:32.012
It's all right,
she's good.

36:33.692 --> 36:34.932
What happened?

36:38.030 --> 36:39.440
Why aren't you healing?

36:39.531 --> 36:41.988
(SIGHING)
I don't have my powers
anymore, Nathan.

36:45.746 --> 36:47.111
Dad took them.

36:49.041 --> 36:50.030
Dad's dead.

36:50.125 --> 36:52.036
He's not, he's alive.

36:52.127 --> 36:53.583
Iwas there, Pete. I saw...

36:53.670 --> 36:55.285
He's alive, Nathan.

36:57.466 --> 37:00.629
And ifwe don't do
something to stop him,
he's gonna kill us all.

37:05.974 --> 37:09.887
That's just...
It's impossible, Pete.
Dad died over a year ago.

37:14.525 --> 37:15.856
(GRUNTING)

37:15.943 --> 37:18.730
He's the one who put
Mom in that coma.

37:18.821 --> 37:21.107
Pete, this is our dad
we're talking about here.

37:22.491 --> 37:25.403
Believe me,
dads aren't always
what they seem.

37:31.333 --> 37:33.198
Where is he?
Stay away from him.

37:33.293 --> 37:36.535
He's dangerous, Nathan.
Look what he did to me.

37:36.630 --> 37:40.498
If our father's alive,
I need to know where he is.

37:42.094 --> 37:43.834
What's the name
of the company?

37:45.681 --> 37:47.012
Pinehearst.

37:49.435 --> 37:51.300
Pinehearst,
the bioteCh firm?

37:51.395 --> 37:53.181
No, I'm not gonna
let you do this.

37:53.272 --> 37:57.265
Nathan, trust me.
Please.

37:57.359 --> 37:58.519
Okay.

37:59.653 --> 38:01.063
We'll do it your way.

38:02.030 --> 38:04.442
There's a lot of ways
to shut Pinehearst down.

38:05.534 --> 38:09.243
Look, I'll call somebody up
from the Justice Department.
We'll get some help.

38:21.884 --> 38:24.296
You're not gonna
listen to a word
he just said, are you?

38:24.386 --> 38:28.379
Nope. I'm gonna see
my father. How do you
know about Pinehearst?

38:29.683 --> 38:33.050
I've been taking
a consultant fee from
them for over a year.

38:33.145 --> 38:37.058
I'm coming with you.
I know the players there.
I can open doors.

38:37.149 --> 38:41.643
I don't need any doors opened.
I plan on kiCking them down.

38:48.327 --> 38:50.318
HIRO: Is that food?

38:50.412 --> 38:54.496
It's a recipe.
It's been in my family
for thousands of years.

38:56.668 --> 39:01.503
You refuse to go baCk
in time, even if
it means saving the world.

39:01.590 --> 39:03.501
I cannot risk
Changing history.

39:03.592 --> 39:07.460
If only there's some
other way of learning
about my enemies,

39:07.554 --> 39:10.341
uncovering their weak parts,
so I can defeat them.

39:10.432 --> 39:14.016
For thousands of years,
my family have
taken spirit walks,

39:14.102 --> 39:17.936
following destiny's path
into the realms
of the unconsciousness.

39:28.951 --> 39:30.441
(EXHALES)

39:32.871 --> 39:34.202
Delicious.

39:36.458 --> 39:40.417
Spirit walk
sounds much safer
than time travel.

39:41.588 --> 39:42.748
Okay.

39:43.549 --> 39:46.632
I'm ready to
begin myjourney.
How do I start?

39:46.718 --> 39:51.462
You eat a disgusting paste
made from the roots
of a Tamboti tree

39:51.557 --> 39:53.468
and the dung of hyena.

40:00.649 --> 40:02.059
And then?

40:02.150 --> 40:03.686
You wait.

40:15.664 --> 40:17.905
Hiro? Hiro?

40:18.000 --> 40:19.285
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

40:20.002 --> 40:22.459
You tricked him.
Iwarned him.

40:22.546 --> 40:25.629
If he did not Choose his path,
it would be Chosen for him.

40:25.716 --> 40:27.752
Hiro. Hiro.

40:27.843 --> 40:30.676
ANDO: He's going
to wake up, right?
He's going to be okay?

40:31.847 --> 40:35.715
Hiro. Hiro. Hiro. Hiro.
