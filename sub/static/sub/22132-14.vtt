09:21.720 --> 09:33.310
low baby with coconut milk

09:29.740 --> 09:35.169

09:42.399 --> 09:46.329
get this rinsed off of me and get to

09:44.080 --> 09:48.550
work but maybe we'll bump into each

09:46.330 --> 09:50.259
other again sometime hopefully next time

09:48.549 --> 10:01.219
I won't be holding something so cold

09:50.259 --> 10:04.639
fronts

10:01.220 --> 10:06.560
smoothie you remember that move big left

10:04.639 --> 10:09.049
toe right slammed up the snowcone honor

10:06.559 --> 10:12.078
and suddenly you're standing next to the

10:09.049 --> 10:20.319
future mrs. shaun munro it was an

10:12.078 --> 10:26.379
accident Jason that better was

10:20.320 --> 10:28.180
northshore lifeguard truck ready she

10:26.379 --> 10:29.139
brought it from her brother never seen

10:28.179 --> 11:30.219
her before

10:29.139 --> 11:33.429
no I'd remember

11:30.220 --> 11:35.050
I wonder where she's coming here I think

11:33.429 --> 12:01.839
we just met the new head of the North

11:35.049 --> 12:06.519
Shore lifeguards

12:01.840 --> 12:10.780
I

12:06.519 --> 12:16.240
again I'm Shaun Munro nie head up a

12:10.779 --> 12:19.360
watch hawaii and this is my desk and a

12:16.240 --> 12:21.669
very nice desk it is chair to economic

12:19.360 --> 12:23.590
probably avoid that dreadfully painful

12:21.669 --> 12:26.799
ending of the wrist ligaments while you

12:23.590 --> 12:28.990
type and you are the new head of the

12:26.799 --> 12:30.370
North Shore lifeguards this is our

12:28.990 --> 12:32.889
facility and i don't mean to seem

12:30.370 --> 12:35.019
inhospitable but you and your staff for

12:32.889 --> 12:37.419
taking up a little bit too much space

12:35.019 --> 12:44.409
actually I was just looking for a name

12:37.419 --> 12:45.519
Jenna avid pleasure sticky huh sorry he

12:44.409 --> 12:49.059
spilled snow corner

12:45.519 --> 12:49.990
Matsumoto's sunny is snow cone off her

12:49.059 --> 12:52.419
chest

12:49.990 --> 12:53.740
I believe that relationships and

12:52.419 --> 12:56.139
relationships work best when they're

12:53.740 --> 12:57.730
built on a foundation of truth I think

12:56.139 --> 13:00.370
it's best if I introduce myself to you

12:57.730 --> 13:06.460
and your staff at the same time

13:00.370 --> 13:07.690
don't you agree oh I sure let me be

13:06.460 --> 13:10.180
clear about this

13:07.690 --> 13:11.440
first of all we welcome and applaud your

13:10.179 --> 13:14.979
efforts to form an elite group of

13:11.440 --> 13:18.100
international lifeguards here's the deal

13:14.980 --> 13:19.960
you guys are visitors this is our

13:18.100 --> 13:22.779
facility and it's a functioning Hawaiian

13:19.960 --> 13:26.110
lifeguard headquarters now you guys

13:22.779 --> 13:28.659
train here you live here and that's cool

13:26.110 --> 13:31.600
it's not a problem we all know the

13:28.659 --> 13:35.049
governor approved it but here's a little

13:31.600 --> 13:37.300
change on the days when we the working

13:35.049 --> 13:39.099
life guards are short-handed you will

13:37.299 --> 13:41.559
enhance your training by taking regular

13:39.100 --> 13:43.930
assignments consider it in lieu of rent

13:41.559 --> 13:46.179
and since I believe that there is no

13:43.929 --> 13:49.839
time like the presence we will start our

13:46.179 --> 13:52.329
newfound partnership today we already

13:49.840 --> 13:52.870
have our training schedule set for the

13:52.330 --> 13:54.370
day

13:52.870 --> 13:55.990
well i'm sure in your administrative

13:54.370 --> 13:57.310
talents and wisdom you will find a way

13:55.990 --> 13:59.500
to work this one out

13:57.309 --> 13:59.849
matter of fact I am so confident that I

13:59.500 --> 14:14.179

13:59.850 --> 14:20.089
this up to you

14:20.089 --> 14:25.820
call in to Mitch find out if this is

14:22.100 --> 14:34.159
part of the deal but until i talk to him

14:25.820 --> 14:36.829
we're gonna go along with it

14:34.159 --> 14:38.448
look Shawn do me a favor right with

14:36.828 --> 14:39.769
until I get back from the mainland and I

16:58.669 --> 17:10.348
organizational skills right

18:56.309 --> 19:03.960
whatever happened to you training me

19:02.849 --> 19:06.679
whatever happened to you getting me

19:03.960 --> 19:11.630
ready for the xterra

19:06.680 --> 19:15.259
so you say something else about what the

19:11.630 --> 19:17.750
honeymoon capital of the world are we

19:15.259 --> 19:19.129

19:17.750 --> 19:20.809
place that we were supposed to go and

19:19.130 --> 19:22.220
visit together a little place where I'm

19:20.809 --> 19:24.109
supposed to run the xterra world

19:22.220 --> 19:25.819
championship that I'm in no way shape or

19:24.109 --> 19:28.909
form ready for because of your

19:25.819 --> 19:31.939
organizational crap what is this about

19:28.910 --> 19:33.590
the triathlon or the wedding was the

19:31.940 --> 19:35.779
last I heard you pretty much said that

19:41.599 --> 19:45.799
but what happened to my trainer what

19:44.210 --> 19:48.650

19:45.799 --> 19:50.960
anymore JD today is a perfect example

19:48.650 --> 19:52.519
look at us you and me alone on this

19:50.960 --> 19:58.579

20:20.069 --> 20:30.929
a long time out

20:27.900 --> 20:35.340
see what I mean people have no respect

20:30.930 --> 20:36.450
for anything anymore just because full

20:35.339 --> 20:41.459
of junk

20:36.450 --> 20:43.140
JD we were talking about us about our

20:41.460 --> 20:47.190
friendship and how we lost sight of that

20:43.140 --> 20:50.970
maybe you have but i have it never lose

20:47.190 --> 20:59.500
would you look at that would you please

22:15.638 --> 22:19.869
resupplying the lifeguard tower

22:17.470 --> 22:22.419
well it's gotta get done right by a

22:19.869 --> 22:24.128
rookie

22:22.419 --> 22:25.929
your friend seems to be getting under

22:24.128 --> 22:29.558
everyone's skin tomorrow will probably

22:25.929 --> 22:32.169
be giving potty breaks I doubted really

22:29.558 --> 22:33.519
yesterday I didn't think our track

22:32.169 --> 22:37.179
international training team would be

22:33.519 --> 22:40.808
reduced to making spira gon be patient

22:37.179 --> 22:43.120
we this is a one-time deal kid yourself

22:40.808 --> 22:45.638
don't kid me if anyone around here knows

22:43.119 --> 22:46.628
the type i do believe me she has an

22:45.638 --> 22:49.599
agenda

22:46.628 --> 22:55.189
she's going to become a real pain in the

22:49.599 --> 23:02.309
butt back she already has

22:55.190 --> 23:05.400
value

23:02.309 --> 23:07.710
yeah you go ahead yeah we've got a

23:05.400 --> 23:10.980
little situation to get down

23:10.980 --> 23:49.679
get any real fast

24:19.539 --> 24:22.119
lot let's go

24:20.349 --> 24:24.519

24:22.119 --> 24:29.109
slide it in the family page which is

24:24.519 --> 24:33.309
precisely the reason we're here least

24:46.599 --> 24:50.289
cloud of nuclear contamination is being

24:48.579 --> 24:53.049
carried on the wind to our precious

24:50.289 --> 24:54.579
islands that end we sacrifice our bodies

24:53.049 --> 24:57.519
as the ultimate symbol of innocence of

24:54.579 --> 24:59.919
our people and our land and agree with a

24:57.519 --> 25:05.788
minute that's not the point Jason and

24:59.920 --> 25:22.750
now the fun stars

25:05.788 --> 25:25.000
send in the clowns the surfaces here

25:22.750 --> 25:27.130
what exactly would you like us to do I'd

25:25.000 --> 25:29.079
like you to get them out of the water in

25:27.130 --> 25:31.450
the water there's your problem

25:29.079 --> 25:34.299

25:38.859 --> 25:43.479
Steinbeck the spokeswoman for the

25:40.509 --> 25:45.099
protesters they will remain in the water

25:43.480 --> 25:46.509
with no clothes on until the

25:45.099 --> 25:48.939
contaminated here in the upper

25:46.509 --> 25:52.240
atmosphere passes over Hawaii completely

25:48.940 --> 25:53.769
and our islands are safe this time there

25:52.240 --> 25:56.200
comes a time and the place where the

25:53.769 --> 25:58.059
line must be drawn today it is in the

25:56.200 --> 26:01.390
sand on this Beach because this is

25:58.059 --> 26:08.230
definitely the place we go tell miss

Abbott to get over your code to

26:08.230 --> 26:13.000
based on your right and may have a point

26:10.210 --> 26:16.329

26:13.000 --> 26:18.700
used to be fashionable now nobody cares

26:16.329 --> 26:20.409

26:18.700 --> 26:24.700
suits off and we should jump in the

26:20.410 --> 26:27.400
water with some enjoyment take that as a

26:24.700 --> 26:30.130
no you know what else that little miss

26:51.519 --> 27:03.700
watching tell me I'm wrong I well

27:01.480 --> 27:05.860

27:05.859 --> 27:09.129
bona fide action is taken by the proper

27:08.288 --> 27:11.259
authorities

27:09.130 --> 27:13.120
oh that's right can't have a protest

27:11.259 --> 27:15.759

CNN without a little blood right i mean

27:15.759 --> 27:21.158
that's this is all about isn't it easy

27:45.579 --> 27:50.829

27:50.829 --> 27:54.759
situation off to the international

27:52.298 --> 27:57.429
training team they handle it great fine

grab some towels

28:32.470 --> 28:40.298

28:35.919 --> 28:47.160
by the establishment play on our fear we

28:40.298 --> 28:50.549
are stronger than you make sure

28:59.789 --> 29:02.190
here

29:00.359 --> 29:04.889
What's in question is how you choose to

29:02.190 --> 29:06.210
convey that message you can't do it here

29:04.890 --> 29:07.890
you're making a mockery of everything

29:06.210 --> 29:10.710
you believe it

29:07.890 --> 29:13.950
yeah you want the confrontation because

29:10.710 --> 29:15.750
you want your face on TV this once the

29:13.950 --> 29:19.350
confrontation to become violent because

29:15.750 --> 29:22.589
it feeds on that but this is not my

29:19.349 --> 29:25.019
beach it's your beach

30:53.500 --> 30:58.298
emergency right and you barely got a

I know this is a great invention right

31:58.099 --> 32:07.129
portable convenient useful exactly but

32:02.089 --> 32:11.059
why how you have to hold it in your hand

32:07.130 --> 32:14.630
yes otherwise it drops to the bottom of

32:11.059 --> 32:17.599
the seat but would it be better if it

32:14.630 --> 32:19.820
was hands-free hands-free lots of times

32:17.599 --> 32:22.579
we need to be rear and Rescue right we

32:19.819 --> 32:25.579
need both hands with this one hand has

32:22.579 --> 32:28.099
to hold this candice fear not efficient

32:25.579 --> 32:29.089
ok and it might be if we didn't have to

32:28.099 --> 32:39.089
use our hands

are you gonna listen I'm sorry I mean

33:13.500 --> 33:18.509
