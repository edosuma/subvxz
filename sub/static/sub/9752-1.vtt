00:13.232 --> 00:14.096
Gita!

00:17.403 --> 00:19.428
I want to talk to you
about something important.

00:20.406 --> 00:22.431
I cannot keep it in me anymore.

00:23.576 --> 00:24.941
Go on.

00:26.579 --> 00:29.104
I had recognized you at the
bookshop in Delhi.

00:30.182 --> 00:32.946
And I'd guessed that you had
come to take Kaveriamma away.

00:33.819 --> 00:36.652
You did not make a mistake
in the address of Charanpur.

00:37.590 --> 00:39.717
I had deliberately given you
the wrong directions.

00:42.261 --> 00:44.161
Why is that?

00:45.931 --> 00:47.228
Call me childish...

00:48.767 --> 00:51.395
... but I did not want you
to reach Charanpur

00:52.271 --> 00:53.738
and to meet Kaveriamma.

00:55.274 --> 00:59.404
For all that you're doing for the
school, I'd like to thank you!

01:01.113 --> 01:03.411
But I cannot let you take
Kaveriamma away.

01:03.616 --> 01:04.480
Why?

01:04.950 --> 01:06.474
You want her so that

01:07.286 --> 01:10.255
she can take care of your house
and do all the household chores.

01:10.456 --> 01:11.423
How dare you say that?

01:12.124 --> 01:13.751
How can you accuse me
of such a motive?

01:14.126 --> 01:15.923
I have travelled 12,000 miles
only out of concern for...

01:16.462 --> 01:17.929
... Kaveriamma's well being.

01:18.130 --> 01:19.757
If you were so concerned

01:20.132 --> 01:22.600
then where were you when she
was in an Old Age Home?

01:22.801 --> 01:25.065
It was I who traced her
and got her here.

01:25.471 --> 01:28.099
Maybe, that's because

01:28.374 --> 01:31.468
you needed someone to take
care of Chikku and your house.

01:36.148 --> 01:37.775
Why did you come back?

01:39.318 --> 01:41.115
Why did you have to come back?

01:43.322 --> 01:45.290
We were so happy.

01:46.825 --> 01:48.986
You have everything in life.

01:51.330 --> 01:55.289
But all we have is Kaveriamma.

01:57.169 --> 01:59.501
You are not the only one
with a right over her.

02:02.675 --> 02:07.135
I agree that she is
like a mother figure to you...

02:07.846 --> 02:09.473
... and you like a son to her.

02:11.850 --> 02:13.477
But she is a mother to me too.

02:16.855 --> 02:21.155
I don't want to
become an orphan again!

02:25.030 --> 02:26.520
I understand Gita.

02:30.035 --> 02:32.663
I will not allow you to take
Kaveriamma away from me.

02:37.209 --> 02:39.609
Kaveriamma will come
with me to America.

02:42.881 --> 02:46.442
Whether you like it... or not!

03:09.408 --> 03:11.774
I'm in a dilemma Fatima.

03:12.077 --> 03:16.207
Mohan is asking me to go with him,
while Gita expects me to be here.

03:16.415 --> 03:17.541
I just don't know what to do.

03:17.750 --> 03:21.880
Allah knows, when Mohan arrived
I was so happy for you.

03:22.087 --> 03:25.181
But I never thought things
would get into such a tangle.

03:25.424 --> 03:28.825
You'll have to disappoint
one or the other.

03:28.927 --> 03:34.593
I'm not clear whether I should go to
America with Mohan or not!

03:34.933 --> 03:40.235
I don't understand why he
wants to take you there?

03:40.439 --> 03:44.808
To work there? Did you ask him?

03:45.611 --> 03:51.743
No Fatima. He respects me.
He'll take good care of me.

03:52.017 --> 03:54.952
Well, I hope you are right Kaveri.

03:55.287 --> 03:58.984
Otherwise who is to know what
tomorrow has in store?

04:02.127 --> 04:06.655
Kaveri, why don't you ask
Mohan to stay on over here?

04:07.065 --> 04:10.330
No, he won't agree.

04:10.636 --> 04:12.831
Remember one thing...

04:13.205 --> 04:17.107
... every piece of ice is inevitably
ordained to melt in its own water!

04:17.309 --> 04:20.176
Get him to understand
this perfectly well.

04:39.498 --> 04:40.760
We played a lot.

04:43.268 --> 04:44.735
Kaveriamma...

04:45.003 --> 04:47.870
... you can stop looking
for a groom for me!

04:48.173 --> 04:51.142
I have decided... not to get
married at this point!

04:51.343 --> 04:53.004
But why?

04:53.679 --> 04:59.879
Yes. I want to focus all my time on the
children and the school's progress.

05:00.686 --> 05:03.416
That's alright, but...

05:03.689 --> 05:06.852
Furthermore, I'm not yet prepared
for marriage!

05:14.032 --> 05:16.466
Well done!

05:17.870 --> 05:20.930
This is a good move
to stall Kaveriamma from leaving.

05:22.708 --> 05:26.439
But then, come to think of it
who will want to marry you anyway?

05:26.645 --> 05:29.614
Now, don't get me wrong!
I'm not saying you're not beautiful.

05:29.882 --> 05:35.184
But this attitude, tonnes of
ideals and principles...

05:35.387 --> 05:37.252
... who'll suffer all this?

05:37.890 --> 05:40.825
It's a good thing, you have
decided to opt out yourself.

05:41.560 --> 05:46.964
But there is one crazy guy,
who might want to marry you.

06:00.345 --> 06:02.711
Yes Mohan, the precipitation
measurement list has been drawn up.

06:02.981 --> 06:05.848
You understand what I'm saying?
- Yes Vinod.

06:06.084 --> 06:10.384
We've tested the dual frequency radar,
the horizontal & vertical resolution's fine

06:10.589 --> 06:17.222
Yes, but the waveforms need to match
with the longitudinal parabolas.

06:17.429 --> 06:19.226
Of course, of course
they work in alignment.

06:19.598 --> 06:20.860
Nivaaranji... Nivaaranji...

06:21.266 --> 06:23.393
Here speak to Steve.
- Hi Mohan.

06:23.602 --> 06:27.732
Steve, what about the
geometrical axis function?

06:28.273 --> 06:33.006
It's being calibrated. The baseline
parameter's been optimized.

06:33.445 --> 06:38.815
See, the sun-synch orbit needs to be in
alignment with the radiometers of TRMM.

06:39.451 --> 06:41.749
Ok, I'll make the remaining readings
and call you in a couple of days.

06:42.054 --> 06:43.316
Ok, thanks.

06:43.789 --> 06:47.316
Hey Mohan so how's everything else?

06:47.626 --> 06:49.651
Everything's fine. All is well.

06:49.962 --> 06:51.930
So, have you found yourself
a village belle?

06:52.297 --> 06:53.423
Actually, you can say yes.

06:53.532 --> 06:54.897
What?

06:55.133 --> 06:57.658
You're kidding me right?
- No.

06:58.804 --> 07:00.795
What's her name?

07:01.139 --> 07:04.540
Her name is Gita.
Kaveriamma lives with her.

07:04.810 --> 07:06.471
I don't believe this!

07:06.812 --> 07:08.473
Except, she's no village belle...

07:08.814 --> 07:11.476
She studied in Delhi
and now she runs a school here.

07:11.650 --> 07:13.948
Have you told her?

07:14.319 --> 07:15.616
Does she know?

07:15.988 --> 07:17.956
How can I tell her?
- What do you mean?

07:18.156 --> 07:19.555
I mean...

07:20.325 --> 07:25.627
I mean she's got a different set
of ideals et al. She's just different.

07:25.998 --> 07:28.398
Come on!
You can't make that mistake.

07:28.667 --> 07:30.134
You have to tell her how you feel.

07:30.502 --> 07:32.129
All right... if you say so.

07:32.337 --> 07:34.464
Listen I'll catch up with you later,
gotta go now.

07:34.673 --> 07:38.336
Your two weeks are almost up!

07:39.011 --> 07:40.069
I know.

07:40.345 --> 07:41.471
I'll be back soon.

07:41.680 --> 07:45.275
You should have been back already.
- But let me propose to her first.

07:45.684 --> 07:48.084
I'll be leaving soon,
catch up with you later, bye.

07:48.220 --> 07:49.209
Bye.

07:51.356 --> 07:53.347
Gurnaamji, how much was that?

07:56.361 --> 07:59.194
32 minutes. Is it ok if I pay tomorrow?
- Yes.

07:59.531 --> 08:03.331
My apologies Mohanbabu!
The electricity is problematic here.

08:34.732 --> 08:37.030
Why are you trying to
corrupt Chikku's mind?

08:37.235 --> 08:38.861
What are you talking about?

08:39.071 --> 08:42.529
Haven't you been talking to him and
his friends about going to America?

08:42.741 --> 08:44.207
No Gita, I was just explaining...

08:44.409 --> 08:48.709
Am I teaching these kids so that they can
go abroad and settle down like you?

08:48.914 --> 08:51.974
You NRI. Non-Returning Indian!

08:55.754 --> 08:57.278
Hand me the mug, please.

08:58.757 --> 09:01.726
You don't even know how to have a bath.
You should learn from Chikku.

09:01.927 --> 09:03.394
Gita, I think you need a vacation.

09:03.762 --> 09:06.026
Why don't you come back
with me for one?

09:08.266 --> 09:10.063
Gita, you are very mischievous.
Where's the bucket?

09:10.268 --> 09:11.735
Listen...
- No. You listen to me.

09:11.937 --> 09:15.737
What?
- I like you very much... Gitli!

09:16.108 --> 09:18.076
What?!
- It's true, Gitli!

09:18.443 --> 09:23.039
I liked the way you handled
that man in the bookshop.

09:23.381 --> 09:27.750
Don't try to sweet talk me.
Kaveriamma will stay here... with me!

09:27.953 --> 09:30.581
You're misunderstanding.
I really like you.

09:30.956 --> 09:34.084
Shut up! And don't you try
to corrupt the kids again, ok?

09:34.292 --> 09:37.557
I'm not corrupting anyone.
I'm only bathing.

09:41.233 --> 09:44.396
More than the kids, you're the
one who needs an education!

09:49.307 --> 09:51.707
You can keep calling out to
YOUR Kaveriamma now.

10:06.158 --> 10:10.652
All right now, remove your notebooks.
The topic is General Knowledge.

10:10.996 --> 10:12.224
So who's going to tell me...

10:12.430 --> 10:16.730
... the names of five of the most
important rivers in the country?

10:18.603 --> 10:20.798
I'm sorry to be late teacher.

10:31.283 --> 10:33.080
Look ahead.

10:37.689 --> 10:39.884
Today I'm going to take your class!

10:42.360 --> 10:43.725
First question...

10:44.029 --> 10:47.328
... name five main rivers in India?

10:48.867 --> 10:50.164
You...

10:51.870 --> 10:52.962
... tell me!

10:55.040 --> 10:56.337
Let me think.

10:58.643 --> 11:02.602
Ganga, Jamuna, Narmada...

11:05.383 --> 11:07.010
... Bharati...

11:08.553 --> 11:09.679
... Panchgani...

11:09.888 --> 11:14.154
Bharati? Panchgani??
Are they rivers?

11:15.560 --> 11:17.221
Vidya, you tell me.

11:17.562 --> 11:22.363
Ganga, Jamuna, Narmada...
Godavari and Brahmaputra.

11:26.671 --> 11:28.161
Excellent Vidya!

11:29.908 --> 11:31.239
Second question...

11:32.077 --> 11:36.980
... name the new state that has
been formed in North-West India?

11:38.416 --> 11:42.318
I know this one.
It was a part of Uttar Pradesh, right?

11:46.758 --> 11:48.316
Yes Chikku. You tell us!

11:48.593 --> 11:50.060
It's Uttaranchal!
- Oh yes, Uttaranchal!!

11:50.262 --> 11:52.196
How could I have missed it?
I forgot!

11:53.098 --> 11:54.690
Well done, Chikku!

11:55.934 --> 11:57.595
Now the last question...

11:57.936 --> 12:01.463
... if our new student does
not know the answer...

12:01.940 --> 12:04.841
... we'll have to demote him to
a lower class.

12:20.458 --> 12:23.518
How many lion heads does
the Ashoka pillar have?

12:27.632 --> 12:29.065
This one is easy.

12:29.467 --> 12:30.297
Three.

12:30.635 --> 12:33.570
Noooooo! It's got four!

12:36.141 --> 12:39.110
Excellent, children!
The lesson of the day is...

12:39.311 --> 12:41.279
... before gaining knowledge
about foreign lands,

12:41.579 --> 12:45.140
it is important that one should
know one's own country first.

12:50.655 --> 12:52.850
Don't forget to do your homework.

13:00.432 --> 13:03.868
The rivers Ganga and Jamuna have
their confluence point in Allahabad.

13:04.169 --> 13:05.932
The new state Uttaranchal...

13:06.171 --> 13:09.470
... is the 27th state of India
with Dehradun as its capital.

13:09.674 --> 13:12.472
This is the land where the
Mahabharata was written!

13:12.844 --> 13:15.039
The Ashoka pillar rests
in a circular abacus,

13:15.347 --> 13:18.475
which is girded by four animals.
The bull of the West...

13:18.783 --> 13:26.554
... the elephant of the East,
the horse of the South...

13:26.858 --> 13:28.758
... and lion by the North.

13:32.864 --> 13:38.996
Gita, the blackboard is clean.

13:46.378 --> 13:48.175
Gita... I am...

13:52.384 --> 13:53.612
Gita... !

13:57.889 --> 13:59.720
But all my answers were correct.

14:00.225 --> 14:04.025
This is Natthu, the potter and
this is Shankar...

14:04.229 --> 14:05.355
... he makes baskets.

14:05.563 --> 14:09.499
Both of them want us to admit
their children in school.

14:09.734 --> 14:12.362
What Mohanbabu said to us
the other day touched our hearts.

14:12.737 --> 14:16.730
We don't want our
children to suffer like us.

14:17.242 --> 14:19.369
On the morning of Dussehra
<i>(Indian festival)</i>

14:19.744 --> 14:22.372
you can come and enroll your
children in the school.

14:22.580 --> 14:24.275
Yes ok.

14:28.253 --> 14:30.380
The tides have begun to
change direction.

14:30.755 --> 14:32.154
Haven't they?

14:41.766 --> 14:43.324
I'm sorry.

14:54.279 --> 14:56.247
Mohan!- Yes?

14:57.615 --> 15:01.574
Mohan, I have some work for you.
- What work?

15:01.786 --> 15:03.913
There's a place called Kodi a
few miles from here.

15:04.289 --> 15:06.416
Gita has some family property there,

15:06.791 --> 15:09.259
which has been leased to a
farmer called Haridas.

15:09.627 --> 15:12.118
He has not paid his rent for
some months.

15:12.297 --> 15:14.060
I want you to go an
recover the money.

15:14.632 --> 15:15.758
Me?

15:16.634 --> 15:18.932
But why do you want me to go?
Can't you send someone else?

15:19.237 --> 15:22.331
If you go and ask
he just might pay up.

15:22.640 --> 15:25.507
Oh! So you want me
to be a collector now!

15:25.810 --> 15:29.974
Ok, when should I leave?
I have to fuel up the caravan.

15:30.315 --> 15:32.283
You have to leave now.
- Now?

15:32.484 --> 15:35.942
Yes, and you can't take the caravan there.
- Then?

15:36.321 --> 15:38.448
You will have to take the train
for three hours to Narsinga...

15:38.656 --> 15:40.715
... then a boat journey across
the river to Maangaon...

15:41.059 --> 15:44.290
... and finally three hours by bus...
and you've reached Kodi!

15:44.496 --> 15:49.058
Sure, that's pretty closeby!
- You'll return by tomorrow evening.

15:49.334 --> 15:53.566
And Mela Ram will go with you.
He knows the way.

15:54.839 --> 15:57.205
Kaveriamma...
- Yes?

15:58.943 --> 16:03.380
My vacation is nearing it's end.
What have you decided?

16:04.949 --> 16:07.315
You finish this work first.

16:13.024 --> 16:14.889
Come on Collector saheb... !

16:18.863 --> 16:20.262
Why are you sending Mohan?

16:20.465 --> 16:23.161
I sent Haridas a message only
a few days ago.

16:24.202 --> 16:26.898
I know what I'm doing!

16:35.613 --> 16:38.173
Good morning sir.
- Good morning Melaram.

16:38.383 --> 16:41.784
I'm all set to take you on a
sightseeing trip of the village.

16:48.393 --> 16:49.553
Ok, I'll take your leave.

16:49.727 --> 16:52.560
Mohanbhaiyya, you'll
bring me a toy, won't you?

16:52.730 --> 16:56.131
Of course! Gimme five... yes!

17:06.243 --> 17:08.973
And what shall I bring for you?

17:09.414 --> 17:10.847
Nothing.

17:12.750 --> 17:17.710
I know you don't want me to leave,
but I have to go for Kaveriamma.

17:18.423 --> 17:21.415
And listen, don't think
about me too much.

17:22.093 --> 17:23.856
Don't miss me too much.

17:24.429 --> 17:27.865
Now what makes you think
that I'll miss you?

17:28.433 --> 17:29.866
The look in your eyes!

17:31.769 --> 17:33.634
They give your feelings away.

18:15.313 --> 18:17.941
O beloved, most beloved, surely

18:18.149 --> 18:21.209
I am infatuated with thee

18:21.486 --> 18:24.614
Thou hast endeared my heart

18:24.822 --> 18:28.280
O beloved...

18:31.162 --> 18:33.960
O beloved, most beloved, surely

18:34.332 --> 18:37.233
I am infatuated with thee

18:37.502 --> 18:40.630
Thou hast endeared my heart

18:40.838 --> 18:43.705
O beloved...

18:43.941 --> 18:46.967
My heart's bewildered

18:47.178 --> 18:50.147
My body with fire kindled

18:50.348 --> 18:53.317
It's monsoon of my dreams

18:53.518 --> 18:56.487
The courtyard of my eyes streams

18:56.854 --> 18:59.823
The pitcher of my heart is overflowing

19:00.024 --> 19:06.987
O beloved...

19:41.899 --> 19:47.769
O dear who hast drawn so near!
O dear who hast endeared my heart!

19:48.072 --> 19:50.870
How canst I recount

19:51.242 --> 19:55.338
What hath been thy bequest pray how?

19:56.247 --> 19:59.216
Somewhere art buds of
a throbbing heart

19:59.417 --> 20:02.386
Somewhere the dream-lanes

20:02.587 --> 20:05.556
Mirth that dwells in the heart,

20:05.757 --> 20:08.385
How shallst I articulate?

20:08.593 --> 20:11.562
Thou swayeth me so

20:11.763 --> 20:16.598
That oft times I am embarrassed

20:16.801 --> 20:23.138
It seems I have lost
my path

20:23.341 --> 20:29.337
Ever since I have seen the
haven of love

20:29.547 --> 20:32.380
Haven of love

20:32.784 --> 20:35.878
O beloved, most beloved,
surely

20:36.087 --> 20:38.988
I am infatuated with thee

20:39.223 --> 20:42.283
Thou hast endeared my heart

20:42.493 --> 20:45.690
O beloved...

21:21.666 --> 21:28.037
Now that thou hast met me
This world's transformed

21:28.239 --> 21:34.235
Methinks the flowers have begun
to beset my path

21:34.445 --> 21:39.940
And I fancy too
That this earth's renewed

21:40.151 --> 21:47.319
The sky too freshly spun
in our love

21:47.658 --> 21:50.593
Wanton breeze singeth some melody

21:50.795 --> 21:55.732
River too narrates some tale

21:55.933 --> 22:02.270
All's changed, my love
since my eyes courted thine

22:02.473 --> 22:08.571
I have lost presence of my mind,
gone is my treasured selfhood

22:08.779 --> 22:12.738
O beloved...

22:30.835 --> 22:32.803
Haridasji!

22:37.174 --> 22:38.198
Haridasji!

22:38.843 --> 22:39.867
Yes?

22:45.149 --> 22:47.845
I'm Mela Ram and this is
Mohan Bhargavaji.

22:48.185 --> 22:49.209
Tell me.

22:49.353 --> 22:53.722
Kaveriji and Gitaji have sent me.
It's about the land's rent.

22:56.027 --> 22:57.221
I understand.

22:57.862 --> 22:59.830
Come in.

23:07.038 --> 23:11.270
You have travelled a long way.
You must be tired. Please rest.

23:12.209 --> 23:14.143
Make some bread.

23:15.212 --> 23:16.839
Run along now.

23:18.049 --> 23:19.141
Please come in.

23:36.233 --> 23:38.599
You really shouldn't have bothered.

23:40.071 --> 23:43.768
How is that possible?
A guest is like God!

23:44.742 --> 23:48.007
We've served what we have;
you eat and then we'll talk.

23:48.579 --> 23:49.568
Ok.

24:03.761 --> 24:08.130
If I had the capacity to pay,
I would have come to Charanpur myself.

24:08.766 --> 24:12.600
Sir, I was a weaver before I
took up farming.

24:13.771 --> 24:16.239
Since the advent of machine
woven fabrics in the market,

24:16.941 --> 24:18.875
weaving had ceased to
be a lucrative business.

24:20.177 --> 24:24.773
So I became a farmer.
I took Gitaji's land on lease.

24:26.283 --> 24:32.222
I'd imagined, once the crops flourished
the children's life would improve.

24:34.291 --> 24:35.815
But it was not to be!

24:37.628 --> 24:38.652
Why?

24:39.964 --> 24:43.764
By taking up farming,
I had changed my profession.

24:45.136 --> 24:50.005
The village elders did not accept this
and looked upon me as an outcast.

24:51.976 --> 24:57.039
They felt a weaver should remain a weaver,
even if it meant, that he had to go hungry.

24:58.983 --> 25:04.250
I cried, pleaded...
but no one listened to me!

25:05.990 --> 25:10.051
Nobody offered a drop of
water to irrigate my land.

25:12.329 --> 25:13.853
Entire crop dried up...

25:15.166 --> 25:18.932
.... and whatever survived,
the villagers refused to buy.

25:20.671 --> 25:23.697
It is because of this, I've not
been able to pay Gitaji's rent.

25:25.843 --> 25:26.935
But this is wrong.

25:30.014 --> 25:34.041
It's unfair. It is an outrage!

25:34.518 --> 25:36.611
It is the way things work here.

25:38.689 --> 25:40.554
Not a morsel to
fill our stomach,

25:41.692 --> 25:45.890
no clothes to wear,
no roof above our heads,

25:46.864 --> 25:49.628
no education for children,
nor land!

25:50.868 --> 25:56.431
The thirst in my heart alone
knows the taste of my tears!

25:59.043 --> 26:00.237
Then what did you do?

26:00.711 --> 26:01.837
What could I do?

26:03.047 --> 26:06.778
I thought about migrating to the city,
hoping life would be better there.

26:08.552 --> 26:11.578
Those who had been there,
recounted the anguish in the cities.

26:13.057 --> 26:18.518
A labourer goes there to work,
and falls into the grip of contractors.

26:20.231 --> 26:25.760
He either returns hungry,
or never returns.

26:27.071 --> 26:30.837
And soon, the wife has to
sell the little land she has.

26:31.742 --> 26:33.266
No sir, no!

26:34.078 --> 26:37.946
I couldn't feed my
children in this life...

26:39.917 --> 26:41.612
... what is to happen after me?

26:42.753 --> 26:45.813
And about Gitaji's money,

26:47.091 --> 26:51.892
I have nothing to offer
except helplessness and shame.

26:53.597 --> 26:54.621
Nothing...

27:11.115 --> 27:14.915
Thank you for the food, Haridasji.

27:51.822 --> 27:53.187
Haridasji, I'll take your leave.

27:58.829 --> 28:02.697
Please don't mind. Here's
some money. Keep it.

28:03.167 --> 28:07.297
Mohanbabu, it's very kind of you
but I can't accept it.

28:07.671 --> 28:09.468
Please Haridasji, I want you to keep it.

28:09.673 --> 28:12.369
When you have it, you can
return it to me.

28:12.676 --> 28:16.442
But I don't know when I will
be able repay it.

28:18.849 --> 28:19.873
Don't worry about it.

28:22.186 --> 28:26.247
Here Chotu, this is for you.
Share it with your sisters.

28:29.193 --> 28:33.892
Please give Gitaji
and Kaveriji my respects.

30:04.621 --> 30:15.429
Water for sale... water for sale...
25 paise for a glass...

30:24.641 --> 30:29.010
25 paise for a glass of water...

30:29.980 --> 30:31.504
Saheb, please have a glass of water.

32:23.427 --> 32:24.894
Mohan you're back!

32:32.936 --> 32:34.494
How was your journey?

32:35.772 --> 32:38.036
Ok.
- Did you meet Haridas?

32:38.942 --> 32:41.809
Yes. But I could not get the money.

32:46.283 --> 32:50.811
His situation is pathetic.
He can't pay the rent!

32:51.121 --> 32:54.579
Instead, sir gave him money
from his own pocket, before leaving.

32:56.627 --> 32:58.822
I couldn't bear to see
Haridas' condition.

33:02.132 --> 33:04.464
I don't think you should expect
any rent from him.

33:07.137 --> 33:09.230
Mohanbhaiyya, did you get me my toy?

33:12.976 --> 33:14.534
I couldn't get anything.

33:18.482 --> 33:19.676
Come Chikku.

33:27.658 --> 33:30.627
Mohan this is the general
state of affairs.

33:32.162 --> 33:35.757
What is money when compared
with the value of human life?

33:37.167 --> 33:39.692
I'm glad you gave him money.

33:40.837 --> 33:45.536
Now don't get disheartened.
Rest a little.

34:00.090 --> 34:01.216
Kaveriamma...

34:02.859 --> 34:04.690
... how do I wrap this around?

34:10.199 --> 34:12.725
Kaveriamma has left for school.
For the decorations.

34:13.203 --> 34:16.103
I don't know why she wants
me to wear this dhoti?

34:16.373 --> 34:18.068
What's wrong with my jeans anyway?

34:18.208 --> 34:21.177
It is the appropriate thing to
wear on Dussehra.

34:21.378 --> 34:22.708
If you wish I can tie it for you.

34:22.879 --> 34:25.347
How do you know?
Have you ever worn one?

34:25.549 --> 34:27.016
It's not a saree, ok!

34:27.384 --> 34:29.248
Ok then! Do it yourself.

34:29.386 --> 34:33.413
All right, all right.
Just do it quick.

34:33.889 --> 34:34.914
Come...

34:39.563 --> 34:40.587
Give...

34:42.733 --> 34:43.757
Hold it.

35:01.918 --> 35:03.317
What the...

35:41.792 --> 35:43.225
There, it's done.

35:46.797 --> 35:48.287
Sure, it's done...

35:48.799 --> 35:52.200
... but I hope it doesn't
unravel in a crowd! Or else...

35:52.402 --> 35:53.426
Shut up!

35:56.306 --> 35:59.764
Today is the auspicious day of Dussehra.
It was on this day that Lord Rama...

35:59.976 --> 36:05.107
had slain Ravana and marked the
triumph of good over evil!

36:05.315 --> 36:11.584
I am very happy that on this day
we initiate new students in the school.

36:23.333 --> 36:24.800
May the Goddess of Knowledge
be with you.

36:25.001 --> 36:26.263
It's Lajwa.

36:34.511 --> 36:37.207
This is our little granddaughter Kusum!

36:42.018 --> 36:43.883
Now, go and play.

36:48.692 --> 36:54.289
Mohanji, where are you off?
Why don't you spend some time with us?

36:56.032 --> 36:59.160
I'm impressed. How well you've
tied your dhoti Mohanbabu?

36:59.369 --> 37:01.166
How did you manage to learn so quickly?

37:01.371 --> 37:03.839
It's pretty easy. It was tied in seconds.

37:04.040 --> 37:05.735
You're looking like a bridegroom.

37:08.445 --> 37:09.241
Thank you.

37:09.379 --> 37:13.475
So how long have you lived abroad?

37:13.717 --> 37:16.015
It's been almost twelve years now.

37:16.219 --> 37:19.086
You must have adapted yourself
completely to their way of living?

37:20.390 --> 37:25.851
We would also like to know a
thing or two about America.

37:26.396 --> 37:31.231
Well... America is a big country...

37:31.401 --> 37:35.360
We've heard that it's also very rich?

37:35.739 --> 37:39.004
Rich it is. But there are several
reasons for that.

37:39.242 --> 37:43.679
One among them is that their land
is rich in mineral resources...

37:43.914 --> 37:47.247
Even our land is rich, but in crops.

37:47.417 --> 37:50.011
Our strength... lies in our fields.

37:50.420 --> 37:52.388
Do they have problems of rain?

37:52.589 --> 37:56.047
Are they affected by drought
and famine like us?

37:56.259 --> 37:58.056
And what about electricity?

38:01.765 --> 38:05.565
They've set up infrastructure to provide
all the basic amenities to the common man.

38:05.769 --> 38:11.833
Electricity, housing board, healthy
food and free education.

38:12.042 --> 38:19.414
We have one thing,
they don't have and will never have.

38:20.784 --> 38:21.808
What?

38:22.285 --> 38:24.583
Culture and tradition!

38:24.788 --> 38:25.948
Yes, agreed.

38:26.122 --> 38:31.924
And till we have that,
no one can destroy us.

38:32.295 --> 38:35.924
Ours is the greatest country in the world!

38:36.466 --> 38:37.262
Absolutely!

38:37.467 --> 38:42.666
Culture and tradition is our strength,
don't you agree?

38:46.643 --> 38:47.940
Munishwar...

38:49.145 --> 38:53.844
I don't think... Mohanbabu agrees!

38:53.984 --> 38:55.178
Do you Mohanji?

38:56.152 --> 38:57.346
You're right.

38:58.321 --> 39:01.347
I don't agree that ours is the greatest
country in the world!

39:05.829 --> 39:11.028
But I do believe that we have the
potential and strength to become great.

39:13.169 --> 39:18.106
Both these countries are economically,
sociologically and culturally apart.

39:18.842 --> 39:23.302
I shouldn't say this but since you have
broached this topic, let me say that...

39:24.180 --> 39:26.774
... whenever we suspect losing
in comparison...

39:27.183 --> 39:29.447
... we clutch on to our favourite refuge...

39:30.854 --> 39:31.843
... culture...

39:32.522 --> 39:33.853
... and tradition!

39:35.058 --> 39:37.083
America has progressed
on its own strengths.

39:37.193 --> 39:39.161
They have their own culture
and own tradition.

39:39.362 --> 39:42.490
It would be wrong to claim
that their culture

39:42.699 --> 39:45.896
their tradition and beliefs
are inferior and ours are laudable.

39:46.703 --> 39:47.897
It's wrong.

39:49.673 --> 39:51.766
But I have heard that

39:51.975 --> 39:57.641
there they discriminate against
members of ethnic races.

39:57.881 --> 40:01.339
Yes! There are clashes sometimes.
Aren't they everywhere?

40:01.551 --> 40:05.920
What is important to analyze is that
we make differences based on caste.

40:07.924 --> 40:15.626
You talk as if we have created the caste,
class, religion and the social system.

40:16.132 --> 40:20.125
This hierarchy of caste is ancient
as is culture and religion.

40:20.770 --> 40:23.204
And colour and creed.

40:23.406 --> 40:27.536
Remember, one's caste is
a thing that can never die!

40:27.744 --> 40:30.872
Just because a custom is ancient,
it does not have to be right.

40:32.248 --> 40:36.548
Why are you imposing your
views on us Mohanbabu?

40:37.520 --> 40:39.579
I am not imposing any views.

40:39.923 --> 40:44.223
I am only speaking of things I've
experienced while living here.

40:44.995 --> 40:47.555
And I've realized that we keep
fighting amongst ourselves...

40:47.664 --> 40:52.226
... when we must fight against illiteracy,
over-population and corruption.

40:52.502 --> 40:57.235
Every day, in our streets and homes,
each one of us keeps saying

40:57.574 --> 41:01.840
"The country has gone to dogs. The
country is on the path of destruction!"

41:02.345 --> 41:06.406
If we keep saying this, we will
one day actually land up there.

41:06.616 --> 41:08.345
You'll need to do
something to remedy this.

41:08.451 --> 41:09.748
You too!

41:09.953 --> 41:12.615
Not just the members of the Panchayat
but everyone in the village.

41:14.224 --> 41:17.387
You are blaming the members of the
Panchayat for your problems.

41:17.694 --> 41:22.757
But when you step into their shoes, you'll
do the same thing. This applies to me too!

41:23.666 --> 41:25.463
The dalits blame the brahmins...

41:25.602 --> 41:29.333
... and brahmins claim that their
piety is despoiled by the dalits.

41:29.973 --> 41:33.272
The blacksmith and potter blame
the moneylender.

41:34.277 --> 41:37.906
The land owners blame the peasants,
but they don't give them their rights.

41:38.815 --> 41:41.943
In what way are we great then?

41:42.619 --> 41:44.883
If we have problems in the village,
we point our finger at the State...

41:45.088 --> 41:49.855
... and the State at someone else.
We all are finding fault with each other!

41:50.293 --> 41:53.729
The fact is that we're all to be blamed.

41:54.330 --> 41:56.798
Because the problem... is us!

41:57.133 --> 41:59.226
Me... you...

42:00.303 --> 42:01.793
... all of us!

42:02.572 --> 42:06.440
Have you lost your head?
What are you saying?

42:07.143 --> 42:08.735
All I know is that...

42:09.779 --> 42:14.113
... a weaver who changed his
occupation by becoming a farmer...

42:15.351 --> 42:18.548
... cannot feed his family

42:20.557 --> 42:23.287
or give his children an education.

42:24.260 --> 42:27.627
He can only watch his kids
die of malnutrition.

43:14.144 --> 43:20.379
Every moment weighs terribly,
we're beset with a calamity

43:20.984 --> 43:27.389
O scion of Raghu race,
come to rescue me

43:28.391 --> 43:32.828
Come, O Raghu stalwart,
O lord, I beseech thee

43:33.029 --> 43:37.159
Adorable lord of my heart,
O my good Ram, appear

43:37.367 --> 43:41.997
I recite thy Name,
hear thou O Ram and come

43:42.205 --> 43:44.173
I recite thy Name,

43:44.374 --> 43:48.071
hear thou O Ram and come

43:48.278 --> 43:50.143
Proclaim glory of truth
by beat of drum,

43:50.580 --> 43:52.741
burn Lanka of sins

43:53.016 --> 43:57.749
At once come, rescue me and
heed loud proclamation mine

43:57.954 --> 44:04.291
Every moment weighs terribly,
we're beset with a calamity

44:04.794 --> 44:11.063
O scion of Raghu race,
come to rescue me

44:21.010 --> 44:24.946
Forget Ram, look!
It's Ravana who hast come

44:25.181 --> 44:29.515
His mighty shadow hath
spread over all quarters

44:29.852 --> 44:35.518
Why dost thou recite Name of Ram?
Why dost thou sing rosary of Ram?

44:35.825 --> 44:39.955
This Ram - Ram thou hast
begun by rote

44:40.163 --> 44:41.425
O Sita!

44:41.631 --> 44:45.658
what virtue didst thou
see in Ram to quote?

44:46.269 --> 44:50.171
Who can recount all His virtues?

44:50.406 --> 44:54.934
Lexicon too falleth short

44:55.445 --> 44:59.404
Who can reach the summits

44:59.649 --> 45:04.086
Where my adorable Ram sits

45:04.621 --> 45:08.990
Ram is most excellent in this world,
unswerving in virtue

45:09.192 --> 45:13.424
Most puissant yet
possessed of restraint

45:13.630 --> 45:17.828
But now his restraint too
hath suffered diminution

45:18.034 --> 45:22.562
O Ravana! It's not too
late to beg for mercy!

45:23.039 --> 45:24.631
May the glory of truth be
proclaimed by beat of drum!

45:25.041 --> 45:27.100
Lanka of sins shouldst burn

45:27.410 --> 45:29.537
Here cometh Ram; we bow unto Him

45:29.746 --> 45:32.044
Accompanied by noble
brother Lakshmana

45:32.248 --> 45:38.448
Every moment weighs terribly,
we're beset with a calamity

45:39.289 --> 45:48.596
O scion of Raghu race,
come to rescue me

45:52.402 --> 45:56.236
Shouldst Ram possess strength;
shouldst He valour proclaim

45:56.472 --> 46:00.374
Why hast He not come to rescue thee,
thy fame?

46:00.576 --> 46:04.376
He whose glories thou
singeth untiring

46:04.580 --> 46:08.880
Pray, where is that Ram at
this moment, uncaring?

46:24.767 --> 46:28.567
Ram resides in mine heart;
Ram is mine breathing part

46:28.771 --> 46:33.868
Ram is soul mine,
Ram doth my life define

46:34.844 --> 46:38.575
Ram in all my moments liveth,
it's Ram in every breath

46:38.781 --> 46:43.445
Ram is in every hope of mine;
Ram is in every wish and pine

46:46.889 --> 46:50.757
Ram verily in compassion stayeth,
in peace too dwelleth Ram

46:50.960 --> 46:55.363
Ram for sure in unity is,
progress too is glory His

46:56.933 --> 47:00.767
Ram, in contemplation of devotees,
and of enemies alike liveth

47:00.970 --> 47:04.736
Forsake sin, O Ravana! And thou
shalt find Ram in thy heart

47:04.941 --> 47:08.843
Ram in thy heart,
Ram is in mine heart

47:09.045 --> 47:12.776
Ram in thy heart,
Ram is in mine heart

47:12.982 --> 47:16.941
Ram in every home and abode,
Ram at every threshold

47:17.253 --> 47:21.917
Whoever shouldst oust Ravana
from the heart, to him doth Ram dart

47:24.227 --> 47:31.759
Whoever shouldst oust Ravana
from the heart, to him doth Ram dart

47:42.011 --> 47:47.972
Every moment weighs terribly,
we're beset with a calamity

47:48.785 --> 47:57.716
O scion of Raghu race,
come to rescue me

48:04.267 --> 48:09.136
Look Lord Ram has come,
Mine Lord Ram has come

48:09.338 --> 48:13.832
Here comes the scion of the Raghu race,
Here he comes to rescue me

48:14.043 --> 48:18.207
Look Lord Ram has come,
Mine Lord Ram has come

48:18.414 --> 48:33.091
Here comes the scion of the Raghu race,
Here he comes to rescue me

49:28.551 --> 49:32.885
Siyavar Ramchandra Ki... Jai!
<i>(Glory unto Lord Ramchandra)</i>

49:52.642 --> 49:57.045
The burning Ravan is looking
prettier in the darkness.

50:32.114 --> 50:35.709
Every moment weighs terribly,
we're beset with a calamity

50:35.918 --> 50:38.546
Quiet! Please be quiet!

50:40.022 --> 50:41.614
Why do I feel that...

50:42.124 --> 50:45.150
... all of you have started
enjoying living in this darkness?

50:45.695 --> 50:47.560
You've adjusted to this darkness?

50:48.731 --> 50:53.691
For how long are you'll going to
take your problems lying down?

50:55.705 --> 50:58.230
But what else can we do, Mohanji?

50:58.741 --> 51:01.107
Will you do as I ask?

51:01.377 --> 51:04.904
Have you once again come up
with some strange solution?

51:05.181 --> 51:07.012
Please have mercy on us!

51:08.851 --> 51:10.318
Wait Munishwar...

51:11.187 --> 51:12.586
What do you want us to do?

51:13.189 --> 51:15.248
Is there a spring on
the nearby mountain?

51:15.458 --> 51:17.517
Yes there is. So?

51:17.727 --> 51:19.524
I need a hundred men.

51:19.929 --> 51:21.863
A hundred men?

51:22.231 --> 51:23.858
You shall have them.

51:24.600 --> 51:26.932
You shall have a
hundred men!

51:27.670 --> 51:28.796
Thank you Dadaji.

51:32.174 --> 51:35.371
Sir, one hears lightning had struck
this spot several years ago.

51:35.578 --> 51:37.443
Since then there has been
this gush of water.

52:01.771 --> 52:04.399
Wonder what he's upto!

52:07.276 --> 52:11.975
This is Point A1

52:14.950 --> 52:17.748
We shall build a reservoir here.

52:18.120 --> 52:20.088
I mean a water tank.

52:20.289 --> 52:22.553
The water will be
acccumulated here.

52:22.958 --> 52:26.985
From here, there will be a water pipe
which leads to Point A3.

52:27.630 --> 52:32.727
A3 will have a shed with a turbine,
I mean a machine.

52:32.968 --> 52:37.029
When the water falls on the turbine,
it will rotate with great speed.

52:37.306 --> 52:42.039
And if all things go right,
electricity will be generated.

52:47.516 --> 52:48.676
We'll form four groups.

52:48.818 --> 52:51.446
The blacksmiths will cast the moulds.

52:51.654 --> 52:55.613
The 2nd and 3rd group will do the
digging work for the tank and so on.

52:55.825 --> 52:58.350
Now let's form the groups.

52:58.694 --> 52:59.718
Quickly!

53:00.162 --> 53:02.960
This boy looks promising!

53:03.165 --> 53:05.030
Surely seems like.

53:05.835 --> 53:09.794
Reservoir will be made here.
Length 5 metres and breadth 1 metre.

53:09.972 --> 53:11.462
I mean, 5 arm's
by 1 arm's length.

53:11.640 --> 53:14.404
For this we will have to clear out
all the stones and bushes.

53:14.577 --> 53:16.306
Is that clear?
-Yes.

53:29.024 --> 53:31.822
It's 7 feet and 6 inches.

54:07.229 --> 54:08.526
Shall I try it?

54:34.089 --> 54:35.681
Where's Mela Ram?

54:37.927 --> 54:41.727
What is this?
- From boot to suit, total American sir!

54:43.766 --> 54:44.892
But why?

54:45.100 --> 54:46.590
Now that we are going to do
business together...

54:46.836 --> 54:49.031
I thought that I should look
like a 40% partner!

54:51.106 --> 54:54.439
This is my passport and this is
my VISA form, fully filled out!

54:54.944 --> 54:56.639
Once it's stamped...

55:10.125 --> 55:12.389
Ballu, show him an
alternator powered 24 watts.

55:12.628 --> 55:13.959
Please come in sir.

55:43.325 --> 55:47.022
Here's your water, Dadaji.
- Thank you, Santaram.

55:47.496 --> 55:49.794
How's the work progressing on the hill?

55:49.999 --> 55:51.227
It's getting on perfectly fine.

55:51.500 --> 55:54.128
How long will it take?
- It will be completed very soon.

55:54.336 --> 55:55.701
You take rest!

55:59.842 --> 56:02.777
I'll take your leave now.
Jai Ramji Ki!

56:14.356 --> 56:18.622
By the way Vinod, will the turbine
principle work in power generation?

56:19.194 --> 56:21.389
Yes. Why do you ask?

56:21.530 --> 56:25.091
You know what, I am trying to
generate electricity here.

56:25.367 --> 56:27.927
Electricity? What the hell
are you talking about?

56:28.871 --> 56:31.567
No, no Vinod, I'm lighting a bulb here.

56:32.708 --> 56:34.835
John is beginning to lose it by the day.

56:35.044 --> 56:36.773
Speak to him, and
buy me some more time.

56:36.946 --> 56:39.676
We've started working nights.
- Common Vinod handle it for me.

56:39.882 --> 56:41.179
I'll talk to you later.

56:41.283 --> 56:43.012
Bye.
- Bye.

56:51.894 --> 57:00.427
25 x 75 is equal to...
- 1875.

57:10.245 --> 57:15.046
23.3 x 33.9

57:20.756 --> 57:24.385
789.87 = 790.

57:52.688 --> 57:55.885
I'm about to finish this.

58:09.138 --> 58:10.901
I've fallen in love with you.

58:22.151 --> 58:25.450
What did you say? Come again.

58:37.666 --> 58:41.397
See! Just see!

58:41.670 --> 58:46.334
It's you and me, and long solitude!

58:46.675 --> 58:50.805
See! Just see!

58:51.013 --> 58:56.041
How delicate are these shadows!

58:56.351 --> 59:00.754
Listen in; heed the heartbeats

59:01.023 --> 59:05.153
Listen in; heed the song of silence

59:05.527 --> 59:14.492
Listen in; heed what the night hath to say

59:14.870 --> 59:16.838
Night's come;

59:17.039 --> 59:19.166
with desires nameless and many

59:19.374 --> 59:23.640
She narrateth a hundred woes;
I listen to her epiphany

59:23.879 --> 59:28.179
Night unwindeth,
unabashed stripeth her cloak

59:28.383 --> 59:33.286
Pearls, scattered as it were; I pick

59:35.224 --> 59:38.853
You have chanted some spell in words

59:39.061 --> 59:44.124
Lamps are alit in my eyes

59:44.399 --> 59:48.130
You have chanted some spell in words

59:48.403 --> 59:53.238
The darkness of my
nights hath poured out

59:57.913 --> 01:00:00.381
Melaram ready?
- Ready sir.

01:00:00.749 --> 01:00:02.307
Release the valve.

01:00:08.423 --> 01:00:13.952
Release the valve further.

01:00:15.264 --> 01:00:16.390
Good!

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:47.258
The water will gush to this
turbine through this pipe.

01:00:47.462 --> 01:00:50.124
The turbine will rotate with
the force of water.

01:00:50.799 --> 01:00:54.200
With this steering wheel, we can
control the water flow.

01:00:54.469 --> 01:00:57.404
We need to release enough water
to make this pulley rotate

01:00:57.673 --> 01:01:03.441
and make this alternator spin
at the speed of 1500 rpm.

01:01:04.146 --> 01:01:06.774
And if this happens,
electricity will be generated.

01:01:09.484 --> 01:01:12.885
Lonely went the day
and nights sans you,

01:01:13.088 --> 01:01:17.787
overcast with desolation

01:01:18.727 --> 01:01:21.890
And now it seemeth the nights,
kissed by the day art perfumed

01:01:22.097 --> 01:01:27.831
for you art my companion

01:01:28.337 --> 01:01:37.405
I was incomplete sans you,
more complete now none couldst be

01:01:37.679 --> 01:01:46.485
In yours, my world I discovered,
yet I am all lost

01:01:46.688 --> 01:01:50.988
Both of us have now learned,
art of living well earned

01:01:51.193 --> 01:01:55.527
Like Midas touch, our living
how well hath altered

01:01:55.731 --> 01:02:01.067
Both of us have now learned,
beauty of life well earned

01:02:05.207 --> 01:02:10.338
O joys, we owneth a score,
enough and more

01:02:38.573 --> 01:02:40.131
What are you'll doing?

01:02:41.243 --> 01:02:45.373
There will be electricity in
your house, Dadi Setu!

01:02:51.353 --> 01:02:56.256
The wires are up. Now all that
we have to do is wait.

01:02:57.192 --> 01:03:00.958
Ready...- Ready sir.

01:03:05.967 --> 01:03:07.195
Nivaaranji ok?

01:03:07.369 --> 01:03:08.495
Yes Mohanji.

01:03:08.704 --> 01:03:11.901
Mela Ram, release the water.
- Ok sir.

01:03:20.382 --> 01:03:21.872
Open the valve...

01:03:22.217 --> 01:03:23.275
Slowly...

01:04:01.757 --> 01:04:04.521
Electricity will be generated at 230 Volts.

01:04:42.197 --> 01:04:44.028
Come on...

01:05:02.984 --> 01:05:06.044
Nivaaranji, is the valve fully open?
- Yes Mohanbabu.

01:05:11.493 --> 01:05:15.259
Mela Ram, is the valve fully open?

01:05:16.198 --> 01:05:18.723
Fully open sir. Totally open.

01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:21.130
Sure?
- Sure Sir.

01:05:25.607 --> 01:05:28.804
Gita, come.
Hold the steering.

01:05:29.611 --> 01:05:30.703
Hold it.

01:05:49.531 --> 01:05:51.931
If the valve is fully open,
how come there's no pressure?

01:06:42.584 --> 01:06:43.744
Has the pressure increased?

01:06:43.919 --> 01:06:45.250
Yes!

01:07:09.611 --> 01:07:11.704
Jafarbhai, how many rpm?

01:07:15.116 --> 01:07:16.640
800 sir.

01:07:46.982 --> 01:07:49.542
I say, how long now for the electricity?

01:07:49.818 --> 01:07:52.514
Have patience Munishwar, patience!

01:08:28.356 --> 01:08:29.913
Electricity!

01:08:45.707 --> 01:08:47.299
Electricity.

01:09:14.069 --> 01:09:16.662
Mohanbabu, we have done it.

01:09:16.904 --> 01:09:20.671
Electricity of our own village!
Generated with our toil and sweat.

01:09:21.076 --> 01:09:24.705
Just like this project, we must
think of newer and innovative ways

01:09:24.912 --> 01:09:27.006
to solve our village problems.

01:09:27.247 --> 01:09:32.447
Sarpanchji, come quickly!
Dadaji's health has deteriorated.

01:09:44.933 --> 01:09:46.194
Dadaji...

01:09:53.108 --> 01:09:55.474
Electricity? Is it here?

01:09:57.112 --> 01:09:58.374
Yes.

01:10:04.119 --> 01:10:05.780
The day...

01:10:06.287 --> 01:10:07.720
... I saw you...

01:10:09.124 --> 01:10:10.216
... I felt...

01:10:11.793 --> 01:10:15.854
... something special about you...

01:10:23.805 --> 01:10:25.568
Now that you're here...

01:10:27.475 --> 01:10:29.443
... I can...

01:10:29.911 --> 01:10:33.779
... die in peace.

01:11:42.217 --> 01:11:45.345
But Mohan, you've already been away
for five weeks. This really isn't right..

01:11:45.553 --> 01:11:49.614
I'm extremely sorry John. I've just been
caught up with some personal work and...

01:11:49.891 --> 01:11:54.521
We are in Phase II of Core design here.
There can't be any further delays!

01:11:54.729 --> 01:11:58.790
I understand John. I've just finished
what I needed to do here and

01:11:59.567 --> 01:12:01.159
I'll be back in three days.

01:12:01.569 --> 01:12:06.097
Three days it is!
- Of course John. Yes... I will.

01:12:27.929 --> 01:12:31.228
What surprises me is how you
can think of going

01:12:31.432 --> 01:12:34.230
after all that you have seen
and learnt here.

01:12:34.769 --> 01:12:36.031
It's true Gita.

01:12:36.604 --> 01:12:39.471
I have learnt so much here,
gained so much here.

01:12:39.941 --> 01:12:41.841
Felt the problems here...

01:12:43.444 --> 01:12:45.105
... but I cannot live here.

01:12:46.114 --> 01:12:48.412
And I cannot live out of this country.

01:12:51.286 --> 01:12:53.447
I am willing to marry you...

01:12:54.122 --> 01:12:56.249
... but I won't go to America.

01:13:17.478 --> 01:13:19.708
I know that you are not going to
come with me.

01:13:20.982 --> 01:13:24.645
Mohan, I've given it lot of thought.

01:13:25.820 --> 01:13:34.728
At this age, I'll not be able to adopt the
ways and customs of another country.

01:13:35.663 --> 01:13:40.157
I am happy here.

01:13:44.172 --> 01:13:46.037
Now that you are leaving...

01:13:49.344 --> 01:13:52.507
... I will miss you very much.

01:13:55.683 --> 01:13:59.380
If you were here, our family
would have been complete.

01:14:29.250 --> 01:14:30.444
I'll take your leave.

01:14:30.718 --> 01:14:32.117
May you live a long life son!

01:14:34.222 --> 01:14:37.419
We had forgotten that you were a guest.

01:14:37.725 --> 01:14:40.558
A visitor must leave one day.

01:14:47.735 --> 01:14:49.999
We'll miss you very much.

01:14:52.907 --> 01:14:54.499
When you come here next

01:14:54.742 --> 01:14:58.872
you'll surely find Internet
in Charanpur Post Office.

01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:01.344
Every little lad will email you.

01:15:02.083 --> 01:15:05.348
What we couldn't have,
is our wrestling match.

01:15:10.091 --> 01:15:13.822
I am sorry Mela Ram that
I have to leave suddenly.

01:15:14.095 --> 01:15:17.553
But I'll surely send you
the sponsorship papers.

01:15:18.433 --> 01:15:21.368
I don't need them anymore.
I'll be fine here.

01:15:22.770 --> 01:15:26.399
Your presence in the village has
changed some things around here.

01:15:26.774 --> 01:15:28.503
Some things have definitely changed.

01:15:28.776 --> 01:15:31.870
But you had planned your migration.

01:15:32.113 --> 01:15:35.913
When the creeper in your house crosses
into your neighbor's compound...

01:15:36.117 --> 01:15:38.312
... one's own house is ruined.

01:15:38.619 --> 01:15:45.149
It's like a lamp on your threshold
giving light to the neighbour's house.

01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:47.018
All the best Sir.

01:15:48.196 --> 01:15:49.754
Thank you Mela Ram.

01:16:02.143 --> 01:16:04.907
Mohanbhaiyya, this is for you.

01:16:12.653 --> 01:16:14.416
I will put this up in my house.

01:16:14.789 --> 01:16:18.122
Listen, study well.
Right!

01:16:38.179 --> 01:16:39.271
Where is Gita?

01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:42.444
I haven't seen her around since morning.

01:16:44.852 --> 01:16:46.217
I have to leave now.

01:16:46.521 --> 01:16:49.081
Or else I'll miss my flight.
- Ok.

01:16:49.690 --> 01:16:51.351
Please explain to her, ok?

01:16:54.529 --> 01:17:02.800
Go son! My love and blessings
are always with you.

01:17:10.211 --> 01:17:12.111
Don't worry...

01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:20.619
Bye.

01:18:13.274 --> 01:18:14.832
Gita, you're impossible!

01:18:15.109 --> 01:18:16.633
You're here and...

01:18:17.612 --> 01:18:19.944
... I've been looking for you all over.

01:18:21.616 --> 01:18:24.449
I did not want to talk to you
before the villagers.

01:18:26.287 --> 01:18:28.778
I'm saddened with your decision

01:18:29.957 --> 01:18:32.357
but I can understand your predicament.

01:18:33.728 --> 01:18:35.161
I can understand.

01:18:37.465 --> 01:18:40.593
Gita, I too understand...

01:18:42.136 --> 01:18:45.970
... but please don't mistake
my helplessness for betrayal.

01:18:46.807 --> 01:18:49.901
I did not mean to hurt you...
- Mohan.

01:18:51.145 --> 01:18:53.204
I love you.

01:18:53.981 --> 01:18:57.712
I want you to be happy wherever you are.

01:18:59.987 --> 01:19:01.181
This is for you.

01:19:05.192 --> 01:19:06.591
What is this?

01:19:06.861 --> 01:19:08.192
Open it.

01:19:16.504 --> 01:19:18.233
What's all this?

01:19:20.341 --> 01:19:23.139
The summation of all our traditions!

01:19:23.778 --> 01:19:26.474
Little flowers of our profound faith!

01:19:27.848 --> 01:19:29.475
Our fields...

01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:31.411
... our greenery...

01:19:31.619 --> 01:19:32.881
... rivers...

01:19:33.387 --> 01:19:35.287
... our culture...

01:19:39.393 --> 01:19:42.226
... all these will keep reminding you of us!

01:19:43.097 --> 01:19:44.655
And maybe...

01:19:46.033 --> 01:19:49.230
... maybe compel you to return!

01:21:00.408 --> 01:21:02.137
Please stop! Don't go!

01:22:01.502 --> 01:22:07.202
And as we can see, we have some points
here that the satellite travels

01:22:07.408 --> 01:22:11.640
along the way to capture data
of the Global Precipitation.

01:22:11.846 --> 01:22:15.805
Next we're going to see the territory
of the GPM instrument,

01:22:16.016 --> 01:22:21.682
as it goes from Australia to India

01:23:18.078 --> 01:23:21.639
This country, thy soil

01:23:21.849 --> 01:23:25.250
It's thy motherland!

01:23:25.586 --> 01:23:31.889
She calls thee

01:23:33.027 --> 01:23:39.023
This is a bond that can
never be severed

01:23:46.006 --> 01:23:49.533
The scent of the soil:

01:23:49.877 --> 01:23:53.040
How canst thou fail to remember?

01:23:53.280 --> 01:24:00.379
No matter where thou wanderest
Thou art bound to return

01:24:00.621 --> 01:24:04.079
From newer paths thou toureth

01:24:04.525 --> 01:24:07.983
From thy sighs hushed.

01:24:08.195 --> 01:24:11.528
From thy forlorn heart

01:24:11.732 --> 01:24:14.360
Some one shalt beckon

01:24:14.568 --> 01:24:18.060
This country, thy soil

01:24:18.372 --> 01:24:21.705
It's thy motherland!

01:24:22.042 --> 01:24:26.502
She calls thee

01:24:26.714 --> 01:24:32.710
This is a bond that can
never be severed

01:24:54.008 --> 01:24:57.466
To thee hast thy life

01:24:57.678 --> 01:25:00.909
Words to proclaim:

01:25:01.215 --> 01:25:04.912
Thou hast gained all

01:25:05.119 --> 01:25:08.520
What dearth to name hath thou?

01:25:08.789 --> 01:25:12.190
All the happiness hath
showered, though:

01:25:12.393 --> 01:25:15.590
Thou art far away from thy home

01:25:15.829 --> 01:25:19.162
Come, return O wanderer

01:25:19.233 --> 01:25:23.329
Where someone wouldst
name thou a kin

01:25:23.570 --> 01:25:30.237
And summon thee to the native soil

01:25:30.444 --> 01:25:33.504
This country, thy soil

01:25:34.214 --> 01:25:37.445
Is thy motherland!

01:25:37.918 --> 01:25:42.355
She calls thee

01:25:42.556 --> 01:25:47.892
This is a bond that can
never be severed

01:25:48.195 --> 01:25:54.327
Now that you're here...
I can... die in peace!

01:25:54.535 --> 01:25:59.438
It is like a lamp on your threshold
giving light to your neighbor's house.

01:25:59.807 --> 01:26:03.937
I've made up my mind, Vinod.
I must go back.

01:26:04.645 --> 01:26:05.942
Not again!

01:26:06.447 --> 01:26:09.905
How can you go back for a girl?
Just persuade her to come here.

01:26:10.117 --> 01:26:11.641
Its not that Vinod!

01:26:11.919 --> 01:26:14.410
It's not only about
Gita and Kaveriamma.

01:26:17.357 --> 01:26:20.520
This is the moment decreed

01:26:20.861 --> 01:26:24.353
In which concealeth

01:26:24.665 --> 01:26:27.964
Full eon

01:26:28.368 --> 01:26:31.235
entire existence

01:26:31.438 --> 01:26:38.810
Don't thou dare ask why roads two
Cross thy path through

01:26:39.012 --> 01:26:46.180
Thou art the one to resolve the road
Thou art the one to discern the code

01:26:46.386 --> 01:26:53.622
Which direction? Whither dost the
path leadeth to true abode?

01:26:53.827 --> 01:26:57.194
This country, thy soil

01:26:57.564 --> 01:27:01.694
It's thy motherland!

01:27:02.202 --> 01:27:07.504
She calls thee

01:27:07.708 --> 01:27:13.613
This is a bond that can never be severed

01:27:14.615 --> 01:27:15.775
I got it.

01:27:16.016 --> 01:27:17.745
Just because you lit a bulb

01:27:17.951 --> 01:27:20.681
now you have delusions of sparking
a revolution in the whole country.

01:27:24.291 --> 01:27:26.691
You're being foolishly romantic!

01:27:29.863 --> 01:27:31.057
Let's leave aside sentiments...

01:27:31.298 --> 01:27:33.357
Have you figured out what you are
going to do there?

01:27:34.668 --> 01:27:37.068
I have a few ideas.
- Like?

01:27:38.172 --> 01:27:43.303
I could be a Project Manager for
Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre.

01:27:43.510 --> 01:27:45.944
I can... I can work in tandem
with NASA from there.

01:27:46.380 --> 01:27:47.938
There's a lot to be done there.

01:27:48.315 --> 01:27:51.842
You're impossible.
I can't understand you!

01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:56.146
If you can't understand
even after hearing all this...

01:27:57.157 --> 01:27:59.216
... then its pointless telling you anything.

01:28:00.527 --> 01:28:02.722
You'll have to come there and see things.

01:28:04.198 --> 01:28:06.462
Otherwise you'll never understand!

01:28:25.819 --> 01:28:30.688
We're just a few minutes away from the
launch of the GPM Spacecraft

01:28:30.891 --> 01:28:32.415
on an important scientific mission to

01:28:32.626 --> 01:28:36.187
better understand the global water
cycle here on earth.

01:28:37.898 --> 01:28:41.994
GPM will allow improvements in
predicting precipitation forecasts,

01:28:42.202 --> 01:28:44.193
and better predict flood hazards.

01:28:44.504 --> 01:28:48.031
We are not tracking any technical
problems at this time.

01:28:48.242 --> 01:28:51.177
All systems are GO on the launch vehicle.

01:28:51.612 --> 01:28:54.809
Weather forecast is very good for today.

01:28:55.816 --> 01:29:00.048
Just a few minutes away from
launching the GPM spacecraft.

01:29:00.254 --> 01:29:03.155
This spacecraft will give us information...

01:29:03.357 --> 01:29:06.758
... that will help us
better predict precipitation

01:29:11.298 --> 01:29:14.324
In addition, we can
better predict flood hazards.

01:29:15.168 --> 01:29:17.830
T minus 20 secs.

01:29:30.450 --> 01:29:33.112
T minus 15 secs.

01:29:35.555 --> 01:29:41.824
T minus 109876

01:29:42.029 --> 01:29:45.123
We have a GO for main engine start

01:29:45.532 --> 01:29:49.696
32 booster ignition...

01:29:51.972 --> 01:29:54.065
.... and Lift-Off!!

01:30:42.456 --> 01:30:44.083
John I tried to knock some
sense into his head

01:30:44.291 --> 01:30:47.021
and tried to convince him
not to leave but...

01:30:49.796 --> 01:30:52.765
Mohan, you do realize
what you are going to lose.

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:57.096
John, I know what
I'm going to gain.

01:30:57.437 --> 01:31:00.964
But you're aware, you could
have gone places.

01:31:02.843 --> 01:31:04.777
I am going places!

01:31:08.815 --> 01:31:13.752
All right Mohan. Go light your bulb!

01:32:09.209 --> 01:32:11.370
Nobody has ever thrown me like this.

01:32:11.745 --> 01:32:13.770
Where did you learn
these wrestling tricks, Mohanbabu?

01:32:14.147 --> 01:32:17.116
Where there is a will, there is a way.

01:32:17.250 --> 01:32:21.346
Afterall, a marshmelon changes its colour
in company of another marshmelon!

01:32:21.521 --> 01:32:22.954
Do you understand now?

01:32:28.095 --> 01:32:31.394
Excellent match, Mohanbabu.

01:32:32.305 --> 01:32:38.167
