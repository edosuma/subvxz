00:11.402 --> 00:14.536
BURNHAM:
Personal log,
Commander Michael Burnham.

00:14.579 --> 00:16.973
My mother taught me
the greatest mysteries

00:17.017 --> 00:18.714
come in threes.

00:18.757 --> 00:22.544
Birth, life, death.

00:22.587 --> 00:27.418
The past,
the present and future.

00:29.812 --> 00:32.075
That's where the Red Angel
is from.

00:36.079 --> 00:40.997
We now have confirmation,
thanks to Mr. Saru.

00:43.086 --> 00:46.089
The angel is humanoid
and wearing an exosuit

00:46.133 --> 00:50.224
made of future technology
we've never seen.

00:50.267 --> 00:52.226
But whose future?

00:52.269 --> 00:54.228
And why?

00:54.271 --> 00:57.231
The only person who may be able to answer these questions

00:57.274 --> 01:01.017
is the one person
nobody can find.

01:03.019 --> 01:04.977
two months before they appeared.

01:05.021 --> 01:06.762
Which presumes the angel
shared them with him

01:06.805 --> 01:08.416
for a damn good reason.

01:08.459 --> 01:11.897
According to his cognitive
tests, he had a mental break.

01:11.941 --> 01:13.508
So, either the
angel broke him

01:13.551 --> 01:16.076
or chose him because
he was broken.

01:16.119 --> 01:18.252
Well, I don't like
either option.

01:18.295 --> 01:23.170
Maybe, uh, it showed him a
future he couldn't process.

01:23.213 --> 01:25.911
We know that he ran
from the psychiatric unit

01:25.955 --> 01:27.783
on Starbase 5.

01:27.826 --> 01:29.698
And we know the shuttle
that he stole

01:29.741 --> 01:32.179
disappeared somewhere
in the Mutara sector.

01:32.222 --> 01:34.311
Any leads?
None.

01:34.355 --> 01:36.139
But if the Federation
and Section 31

01:36.183 --> 01:38.794
are still looking
for him...

01:38.837 --> 01:41.449
I think we need
to find him first, sir.

01:43.190 --> 01:45.148
I need permission
to go to Vulcan.

01:45.192 --> 01:48.238
I haven't spoken to my mother
or father in some time.

01:48.282 --> 01:50.066
Sarek's on the
Federation task force.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.068
If he had any
information, we'd know.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.244
If he did, yes, we would.

01:54.288 --> 01:56.681
My mother, on the other hand,

01:56.725 --> 01:58.901
she hasn't always seen
eye-to-eye with him

01:58.944 --> 02:00.859
when it comes to Spock.

02:00.903 --> 02:03.862
You've already packed
your bag, haven't you?

02:03.906 --> 02:07.214
I'd never do that without
your permission, sir.

02:07.257 --> 02:09.172
Take your leave, Commander.

02:09.216 --> 02:11.305
Good luck, and hurry back to us.

02:11.348 --> 02:13.829
Thank you, sir.
Where are you headed?

02:13.872 --> 02:16.310
We're sticking around Kaminar
for a while longer.

02:16.353 --> 02:18.703
The signal that appeared
with the Angel

02:18.747 --> 02:20.488
left behind traces
of residual decay

02:20.531 --> 02:22.533
that Starfleet's tasked us
with analyzing.

02:22.577 --> 02:24.535
Hopefully, it'll tell us
when and where

02:24.579 --> 02:26.189
in the future it came from.

02:26.233 --> 02:27.712
Then, good luck
to you, too, Captain.

02:29.366 --> 02:30.976
PIKE:
Status report, Mr. Saru.

02:31.020 --> 02:33.153
The sensors have detected
the same spike

02:33.196 --> 02:35.720
of tachyon particles
Admiral Cornwell's team recorded

02:35.764 --> 02:38.810
after our expedition
to the asteroid.

02:38.854 --> 02:41.204
Sir? Sir, these readings
can't be accurate.

02:41.248 --> 02:43.380
5,000 parts
per cubic micron?

02:43.424 --> 02:45.208
That's a lot.
Ah, outside
a supernova,

02:45.252 --> 02:46.905
no one's ever recorded
densities at this level.

02:46.949 --> 02:48.342
It's freaking amazing.

02:48.385 --> 02:49.517
Excuse me?

02:49.560 --> 02:51.214
I'm sorry, sir.
You know how I get

02:51.258 --> 02:53.303
around violations of causality.

02:53.347 --> 02:55.914
Plus, you said that I shouldn't
curse when I was on duty.

02:55.958 --> 02:57.568
What kind of power
source could generate

02:57.612 --> 02:59.222
that amount of
tachyon particles?

02:59.266 --> 03:01.485
Well, the technology may not
have been invented yet.

03:01.529 --> 03:03.226
Let's determine more about
this possible power source

03:03.270 --> 03:05.359
beyond "freaking amazing."

03:05.402 --> 03:07.665
I am attempting to launch
a probe into the anomaly

03:07.709 --> 03:11.103
that may help us determine where
in the future it came from.

03:11.147 --> 03:13.715
But the extreme
tachyon interference

03:13.758 --> 03:15.673
is disrupting
our targeting systems.

03:15.717 --> 03:17.458
Well, let's get closer,
then, shall we?

03:17.501 --> 03:19.199
Helm,
forward, one-quarter impulse.

03:19.242 --> 03:21.810
Airiam, assist Mr. Saru
with analysis, please.

03:21.853 --> 03:23.464
Where's Burnham?On personal leave.

03:23.507 --> 03:25.117
Why wasn't I informed?

03:25.161 --> 03:27.772
Because "personal"
means personal.

03:27.816 --> 03:29.339
Captain, if Burnham's absence
is related

03:29.383 --> 03:32.168
to Spock's disappearance,
you owe me an explanation.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.213
I owe you?

03:34.257 --> 03:36.085
Owe me.

03:36.128 --> 03:38.087
Uh, Mr. Tyler,

03:38.130 --> 03:40.307
the chair outranks the badge.

03:40.350 --> 03:41.960
The comms are off-line, sir.

03:42.004 --> 03:43.397
Tactical systems
have failed, too.

03:43.440 --> 03:44.528
Talk to me, Owo.OWOSEKUN:
Captain,

03:44.572 --> 03:46.356
these readings don't
make any sense.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.793
The computers seem caught
in some kind of loop.

03:48.837 --> 03:51.666
SARU:
Computers do not do well
with temporal distortions,

03:51.709 --> 03:52.710
if that is what
we are dealing with.

03:52.754 --> 03:53.972
Oh, what the frick?

03:54.016 --> 03:55.757
TYLER :
You owe me an explanation.

03:55.800 --> 03:58.629
I owe you?
The chair outranks the badge.

03:59.978 --> 04:01.763
Captain, dead ahead.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.854
What am I looking at?SARU:
It appears to be

04:05.897 --> 04:07.290
a rift in
space-time, Captain.

04:07.334 --> 04:09.249
Full reverse.

04:16.995 --> 04:17.779
S-Sorry.

04:17.822 --> 04:19.954
Systems back online.

04:19.998 --> 04:22.218
Okay, let's not do that again.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.611
Mr. Saru,

04:23.654 --> 04:25.308
load your probe onto
a shuttle, I'll pilot it

04:25.352 --> 04:27.136
close enough to target the
anomaly and launch from there.

04:27.179 --> 04:28.355
SARU: Sir?Test pilot

04:28.398 --> 04:30.313
was my first assignment
in Starfleet.

04:30.357 --> 04:31.575
I know Discovery'sshuttles
better

04:31.619 --> 04:32.576
than anyone else on board.

04:32.620 --> 04:33.577
Well, I have no doubt, sir,

04:33.621 --> 04:34.622
but you are vital personnel.

04:36.667 --> 04:39.583
I'm also the most qualified.

04:43.065 --> 04:46.024
Are you familiar with the term
"bad penny," Mr. Tyler?

04:46.068 --> 04:48.853
Captain, you can keep me
in the dark about Burnham,

04:48.897 --> 04:51.421
but not when it comes to
intelligence about these signals

04:51.465 --> 04:54.337
or the Red Angel. I'm your
official liaison to Section 31.

04:54.381 --> 04:55.643
You have to deal with me.

04:55.686 --> 04:57.209
And what about
the Klingon inside you?

04:57.253 --> 04:59.429
You are aware
the war is over, right?

04:59.473 --> 05:01.039
My problem isn't
with Klingons.

05:01.083 --> 05:03.346
You killed
a member of this crew.

05:03.390 --> 05:06.654
At least
your shadow did-- Voq.

05:08.786 --> 05:11.963
Sorry, but there's no way
to get rid of him, sir.

05:12.007 --> 05:14.009
I know the feeling.

06:53.282 --> 06:55.850
VULCAN OFFICIAL:
Starfleet shuttle,
identify yourself.

06:55.893 --> 06:57.852
This is
Commander Michael Burnham.

06:57.895 --> 06:59.680
Requesting permission to land

06:59.723 --> 07:02.813
at the residence
of Ambassador Sarek.

07:02.857 --> 07:05.990
Is this official
Starfleet business?

07:06.034 --> 07:08.863
I'm not here
as a Starfleet officer.

07:08.906 --> 07:09.994
I'm here as his daughter.

07:10.038 --> 07:12.388
Permission granted.

07:28.665 --> 07:31.494
AMANDA :
My name is Amanda.

07:31.538 --> 07:34.410
My name is Amanda.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.499
What's yours?Michael.

07:36.543 --> 07:38.501
BURNHAM :
Michael.

07:38.545 --> 07:40.895
AMANDA:
Do you want to meet our son?

07:40.938 --> 07:42.940
Do you want
to meet our son?

08:09.314 --> 08:12.622
You are amused
by your own error?

08:14.581 --> 08:16.539
Yeah.

08:16.583 --> 08:20.282
That is... illogical.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.547
Emotions confuse me.

08:24.591 --> 08:26.418
Me, too.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.960
AMANDA:
I'm so glad
you're home, Michael.

08:47.309 --> 08:49.485
BURNHAM:
Spock is still missing.

08:49.529 --> 08:50.878
Mother, I need your help.

08:50.921 --> 08:52.532
AMANDA:
Yes, we know.

08:52.575 --> 08:55.622
Sarek's been like that
for hours.

08:55.665 --> 08:56.884
From the moment
your father heard

08:56.927 --> 08:58.494
that your brother
disappeared,

08:58.538 --> 09:01.062
he's been practicing tok'mar
every day.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.719
I've never seen tok'mar
performed before.

09:05.762 --> 09:07.155
Ancient Vulcans believed
it could bring

09:07.198 --> 09:09.200
lost souls back home.

09:09.244 --> 09:12.247
It isn't working.

09:14.902 --> 09:18.209
I think it's more than that.

09:18.253 --> 09:21.038
Sarek has the most disciplined,
logical mind I know.

09:21.082 --> 09:23.911
If it isn't working,
there has to be a reason.

09:25.739 --> 09:28.219
I think you know what it is.

09:28.263 --> 09:31.135
I haven't heard from him.

09:31.179 --> 09:33.921
The longer he's on the run,
the harder it'll be for him.

09:33.964 --> 09:36.967
Yes, I can see
the logic in that.

09:37.011 --> 09:38.969
No matter how angry
you are with me,

09:39.013 --> 09:40.797
you have to know
how much I love him.

09:40.841 --> 09:42.799
Spock is my brother,
I'll protect him.

09:42.843 --> 09:46.411
Even if I knew where he was...

09:46.455 --> 09:50.633
there is no way
that I would ever

09:50.677 --> 09:54.419
turn him in to be tried for
murders he did not commit.

09:54.463 --> 09:56.160
Mother.

09:56.204 --> 09:57.814
I have not seen him.

09:57.858 --> 10:00.208
My whole life, you've
told me the truth.

10:01.688 --> 10:04.604
That's how I know
you're lying.

10:04.647 --> 10:07.041
If you know where he is,
let me help him.

10:08.782 --> 10:11.393
You have to. You have
to let me help him.

10:15.789 --> 10:19.053
Spock is not how
you remember him.

10:25.886 --> 10:28.758
PIKE:
Shuttle 5 approaching
the anomaly.

10:28.802 --> 10:32.980
Now at minute five, and still
no signs of temporal effects.

10:33.023 --> 10:35.809
Ready to move us another
600 kilometers closer

10:35.852 --> 10:36.940
and reacclimate.

10:36.984 --> 10:38.855
Like a diver rising
to the surface.

10:38.899 --> 10:40.814
Don't want to get the
"time bends," sir.

10:40.857 --> 10:43.991
Time bends. I like that.

10:44.034 --> 10:45.209
Oh, everything sounds
cooler when you put

10:45.253 --> 10:46.384
"time" in front of it.

10:46.428 --> 10:48.517
Oh. Getting readings

10:48.560 --> 10:51.825
off the rift-- time rift.

10:51.868 --> 10:53.696
Transmitting to you now,
Discovery.

10:56.438 --> 10:58.614
SARU:
Captain Pike,
when targeting the anomaly

10:58.658 --> 11:01.486
with the probe, make sure
to avoid the aperture.

11:01.530 --> 11:02.879
The sooner you can launch,
the better.

11:02.923 --> 11:04.228
You are on the clock, sir.

11:04.272 --> 11:05.882
PIKE:
Acknowledged, Mr. S...
Acknowledged...

11:05.926 --> 11:07.797
Acknowledged, Mr. Saru.

11:07.841 --> 11:09.059
Acknowledged, Mr. Saru...

11:09.756 --> 11:10.844
BRYCE:
Vocal analysis shows

11:10.887 --> 11:12.323
that all three
acknowledgments

11:12.367 --> 11:15.675
are the same
transmission, sir.

11:15.718 --> 11:18.982
Captain, you are experiencing
temporal distortions.

11:19.026 --> 11:20.418
Do not proceed any closer.

11:20.462 --> 11:22.159
Launch the probe
from your current position.

11:22.203 --> 11:25.075
Thank you, Mr. Saru.
Registering full stop.

11:25.119 --> 11:26.729
Entering coordinates
and launch sequence.

11:33.562 --> 11:35.738
No!

11:35.782 --> 11:36.739
Something wrong, sir?

11:36.783 --> 11:37.827
Sir?

11:37.871 --> 11:39.742
Launch the probe.

11:51.754 --> 11:54.714
Captain, there's a temporal
shockwave headed right at you.

11:54.757 --> 11:56.933
PIKE:
Copy that.
Engaging evasive maneuvers.

11:57.673 --> 11:59.457
Hold on.

11:59.501 --> 12:01.198
Altering course for...

12:04.898 --> 12:06.856
I've lost them in the time rift.

12:06.900 --> 12:08.815
BRYCE:
I can't locate them anywhere.

12:09.772 --> 12:11.078
No response on any channel.

12:11.121 --> 12:12.427
No transponder reading
from the shuttle, either.

12:12.470 --> 12:14.646
Mr. Rhys?

12:14.690 --> 12:17.171
Do you detect any debris
from an explosion?

12:17.214 --> 12:18.520
I can't see anything, sir.

12:18.563 --> 12:19.564
The sensors are not responding.

12:19.608 --> 12:20.827
If I move the
ship any closer,

12:20.870 --> 12:23.438
the same thing could
happen to us, sir.

12:25.962 --> 12:31.315
Officers, our mission has now
changed from research to rescue.

12:31.359 --> 12:33.796
The captain and Tyler
are counting on us.

12:33.840 --> 12:37.278
Owosekun, rectify our sensor
issues by accounting for

12:37.321 --> 12:39.280
varying tachyon levels manually.

12:39.323 --> 12:41.935
Rhys, continue studying
the anomaly.

12:41.978 --> 12:44.807
We must understand the internal
dynamics of the phenomenon

12:44.851 --> 12:46.504
in order to recognize
deviations.

12:46.548 --> 12:48.768
Because those deviations
might be our missing shuttle.

12:48.811 --> 12:50.900
Correct.

12:50.944 --> 12:52.554
The radiation will be
lethal in five hours.

12:52.597 --> 12:54.817
Do you really think we'll
be able to locate them?

12:54.861 --> 12:58.212
Well, the question may not be
where they are, but when.

12:58.255 --> 13:01.824
We must assume that time does
not move inside the anomaly

13:01.868 --> 13:03.086
along a strictly linear course.

13:03.130 --> 13:05.872
No, it jumbles it all up,
like a blender.

13:05.915 --> 13:07.917
Which makes...

13:07.961 --> 13:12.400
finding the captain
and Tyler... impossible.

13:12.443 --> 13:15.838
For us, perhaps, but...

13:15.882 --> 13:18.319
as we discovered when
Mr. Mudd attacked us,

13:18.362 --> 13:21.801
Commander Stamets has a unique
relationship with time.

13:21.844 --> 13:23.237
The Tardigrade DNA
protects him

13:23.280 --> 13:25.500
from the effects
of temporal distortions.

13:25.543 --> 13:27.981
Perhaps he can see
something we cannot.

13:28.024 --> 13:29.809
Yes, sir.

13:38.165 --> 13:40.863
SPOCK :
Constructionism combines
the epistemological thesis

13:40.907 --> 13:43.344
about what can be known
with a metaphilosophical view

13:43.387 --> 13:45.476
on the nature
of philosophical questions.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.087
Formal logic utilizes
plausible reasoning

13:47.130 --> 13:49.132
and inductive methods
organized into subsystems.

13:49.176 --> 13:50.917
The most important of these
systems is classical logic...

13:54.746 --> 13:57.140
The most important of these
systems is classical logic...

13:57.184 --> 13:58.315
Formal logic utilizes
plausible...

13:58.359 --> 13:59.969
But even if their premises
are true...

14:00.013 --> 14:02.667
All inductive arguments are
therefore deductively invalid.

14:02.711 --> 14:04.669
The premises of an inductive
argument do not entail the truth

14:04.713 --> 14:06.019
of the argument's conclusion.

14:06.062 --> 14:07.847
In deductive logic,
the methods of reasoning

14:07.890 --> 14:09.370
and the procedure for finding
evidence are investigated.

14:09.413 --> 14:11.154
In deductive logic,
the methods of reasoning

14:11.198 --> 14:13.983
and the procedure for finding
evidence are investigated.

14:14.027 --> 14:15.985
Only if it is impossible
for the conclusion to be false

14:16.029 --> 14:17.508
while the premises are all true.

14:31.696 --> 14:33.437
Spock, it's me.

14:47.974 --> 14:49.323
SPOCK :
A deductive argument is one

14:49.366 --> 14:50.063
that aims to show
its conclusions must be true.

14:56.243 --> 14:58.158
BURNHAM:
Spock.

14:58.201 --> 14:59.681
Spock, can you hear me?

14:59.724 --> 15:00.987
Spock.

15:01.030 --> 15:02.292
To say that a logical
construction is valid

15:02.336 --> 15:03.728
is to say that the premises
are true...

15:03.772 --> 15:05.469
It's Michael.A deductive argument is

15:05.513 --> 15:07.994
one that aims to show
its conclusion must be true.

15:08.037 --> 15:09.473
How long has he been like this?

15:09.517 --> 15:11.475
Two days.

15:11.519 --> 15:12.955
I couldn't go to Sarek.

15:12.999 --> 15:14.870
He would weigh the needs
of the many against the...

15:16.002 --> 15:17.264
We've got to get
him to a doctor.

15:17.307 --> 15:19.657
...is classical logic.

15:19.701 --> 15:21.268
Every avenue leaves a trail.

15:21.311 --> 15:23.531
Mother, he's just repeating
the First Doctrines of Logic.

15:23.574 --> 15:24.967
He's trying to ground himself.

15:25.011 --> 15:26.360
SPOCK:
8-4-1-9-4-7.

15:26.403 --> 15:28.318
8-4-1-9-4-7.

15:28.362 --> 15:30.364
8-4-1-9-4-7.

15:30.407 --> 15:32.888
8-4-1-9-4-7. 8-4-1-9-4-7.

15:38.589 --> 15:39.590
What are those numbers?

15:39.634 --> 15:40.852
I don't know, I've
tried looking.

15:40.896 --> 15:41.941
Are they coordinates?
Are they command codes?

15:41.984 --> 15:42.854
Are they birthdays?I don't know,

15:42.898 --> 15:43.855
I've tried everything.

15:43.899 --> 15:46.336
We have to get him
to a hospital.

15:46.380 --> 15:48.034
You're not taking him anywhere.

15:49.513 --> 15:52.386
Mother, if he were
a full-blooded Vulcan,

15:52.429 --> 15:56.042
these emotions would have
driven him insane by now.

15:56.085 --> 15:57.739
You cannot keep him here.

15:57.782 --> 15:59.480
Spock came to me for help,

15:59.523 --> 16:02.222
and I will never turn him in.

16:02.265 --> 16:04.659
And under Federation
law, I don't have to.

16:04.702 --> 16:07.357
Please.

16:07.401 --> 16:09.272
Please don't do this.

16:09.316 --> 16:11.405
As the wife of the
Vulcan ambassador,

16:11.448 --> 16:15.104
I have the legal authority
to invoke diplomatic immunity

16:15.148 --> 16:17.628
in order to shield my
son from extradition.

16:17.672 --> 16:21.023
Unless the ambassador objects.

16:27.377 --> 16:28.944
PIKE:
The sensors are useless.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.467
You're wasting your time.

16:30.511 --> 16:32.643
We need a fixed point to target
if we're gonna navigate

16:32.687 --> 16:34.341
by dead reckoning.You telling me how to fly now?

16:34.384 --> 16:35.646
Captain, I'm not the enemy here.

16:36.908 --> 16:38.388
You got any experience
behind the stick?

16:39.389 --> 16:40.869
Take it.

16:46.831 --> 16:48.442
Adjust heading to 1-90-mark-2.

16:48.485 --> 16:50.357
That's the signal that
brought us to Kaminar.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.315
How is this possible?

16:52.359 --> 16:54.187
It disappeared before
Discoveryarrived.

16:54.230 --> 16:55.797
We're being pulled back in time.

16:55.840 --> 16:56.885
Or worse,

16:56.928 --> 16:58.147
we're traveling
through past, present,

16:58.191 --> 16:59.322
and future all at once.

16:59.366 --> 17:01.063
We could be together
for all eternity.

17:01.107 --> 17:03.196
Unless the rift closes
while we're still here.

17:03.239 --> 17:04.632
In which case,
eternity might not last as long

17:04.675 --> 17:05.633
as we think.

17:05.675 --> 17:07.635
Wait. I have to assume

17:07.678 --> 17:10.507
Discovery'scoming through
the anomaly for our flight path.

17:10.550 --> 17:12.640
Release the plasma
from the nacelles.

17:12.683 --> 17:14.076
Three bursts,
five minutes apart.

17:14.119 --> 17:15.295
The thrusters will ignite
the fuel.

17:15.338 --> 17:17.079
All due respect, sir,
we need this fuel.

17:17.123 --> 17:18.602
That wasn't a suggestion,
Mr. Tyler.

17:18.646 --> 17:20.256
Captain, every decision
you've made so far

17:20.300 --> 17:21.779
is about your guilt
at sitting out the war.

17:21.823 --> 17:22.911
You're trying to
prove your bravery

17:22.954 --> 17:24.391
at the expense of our lives.

17:24.434 --> 17:26.045
That's enough!

17:26.088 --> 17:28.395
You will release the plasma, or
when we get back to the ship--

17:28.438 --> 17:29.787
and we will get back
to the ship--

17:29.831 --> 17:30.875
I'll throw you in the brig.

17:30.919 --> 17:31.876
And then you can
think about guilt

17:31.920 --> 17:33.139
while awaiting court-martial

17:33.182 --> 17:34.531
for failing to follow
a direct order.

17:34.575 --> 17:36.403
Do you understand,
Specialist Tyler?

17:36.446 --> 17:38.840
Initiating plasma abort, sir.

17:46.630 --> 17:48.154
The captain is lost?

17:48.197 --> 17:49.459
How the hell did that happen?

17:49.503 --> 17:51.809
Well, he and Tyler got
swept up in a time rift.

17:51.853 --> 17:53.463
A time rift?
What's a...?

17:53.507 --> 17:55.813
Wait, are these radiation
levels accurate?

17:55.857 --> 17:58.468
They'll reach lethal
exposure in four hours.

17:58.512 --> 18:01.254
And Saru wants me to plot
the shuttle's trajectory

18:01.297 --> 18:03.734
by using the mycelial network
as a constant?

18:03.778 --> 18:05.345
Well, since you have
Tardigrade DNA in your system,

18:05.388 --> 18:06.824
it should be a piece
of cake for you.

18:06.868 --> 18:09.131
Beyond the event horizon,
time exists

18:09.175 --> 18:11.916
all at once, which makes
finding them like...

18:11.960 --> 18:14.919
catching a grain of sand
in a hurricane,

18:14.963 --> 18:16.747
using a pair of tweezers.

18:16.791 --> 18:19.185
Hmm.

18:21.970 --> 18:23.145
To say that a logical
construction is valid...

18:23.189 --> 18:25.495
SAREK:
You lied to me, Amanda.

18:25.539 --> 18:27.758
I assume you hid our son
in this sacred crypt

18:27.802 --> 18:30.196
because it contains
katra stones,

18:30.239 --> 18:33.503
which blocks any outside
telepathic link with him.

18:33.547 --> 18:35.766
You assume correctly.

18:35.810 --> 18:38.682
Your behavior was
impulsive and shortsighted.

18:38.726 --> 18:40.162
AMANDA:
How dare you.

18:40.206 --> 18:44.123
I accepted this life
because I love you.

18:44.166 --> 18:46.603
And now Spock pays
the price...

18:48.214 --> 18:50.259
...like he always has.

18:50.303 --> 18:52.609
This is my worst fear.

18:52.653 --> 18:57.571
Do you know that
I used to read Aliceto Spock

18:57.614 --> 19:01.749
when he was a little boy, before
Michael came into the house?

19:01.792 --> 19:03.577
"...which way I ought
to go from here?

19:03.620 --> 19:05.187
"That depends a good deal

19:05.231 --> 19:06.580
on where you want to get to,"
said the Cat.

19:06.623 --> 19:08.408
Do you know why

19:08.451 --> 19:10.192
I read him that book?

19:10.236 --> 19:12.412
Because Spock had
difficulties.

19:12.455 --> 19:14.762
Human difficulties.

19:15.893 --> 19:19.027
Learning, reading,

19:19.070 --> 19:20.985
writing.

19:21.029 --> 19:26.469
The Vulcans called it
L'tak Terai.

19:26.513 --> 19:31.561
A temporary complication
remedied at the Learning Center.

19:31.605 --> 19:33.389
No.

19:33.433 --> 19:35.739
He had no support.

19:35.783 --> 19:37.524
Nobody wanted to help
a half-Vulcan child

19:37.567 --> 19:42.398
with a learning disability
he'd inherited from his mother.

19:42.442 --> 19:44.270
And in order to
save our son,

19:44.313 --> 19:47.011
I began to read him a story
about how to survive

19:47.055 --> 19:49.057
when up is down
and left is right.

19:49.100 --> 19:51.712
SAREK:
Your obsession with a book

19:51.755 --> 19:55.585
about chaos has done a
disservice to our children.

19:55.629 --> 19:58.022
They were the ones

19:58.066 --> 20:02.244
who were on both sides
of the looking glass.

20:02.288 --> 20:04.246
Not you, Sarek.

20:07.641 --> 20:10.252
You never truly
respected humanity.

20:10.296 --> 20:12.646
If that were true, I would
have married a Vulcan.

20:14.604 --> 20:17.390
Would you have left Vulcan
for me?

20:17.433 --> 20:20.175
No, you wouldn't.
I sacrificed everything

20:20.219 --> 20:22.264
for our family.

20:22.308 --> 20:23.526
That does not change
the fact that you have

20:23.570 --> 20:25.354
harbored a fugitive,

20:25.398 --> 20:28.792
which is a flagrant
abuse of my authority.

20:28.836 --> 20:31.795
I don't live
under your authority.

20:31.839 --> 20:34.276
I'm your wife

20:34.320 --> 20:36.060
and I'm your partner.

20:37.888 --> 20:40.543
Try again, husband.

20:40.587 --> 20:42.893
SPOCK:
"'But I don't want to
go among mad people,'

20:42.937 --> 20:44.547
"remarked Alice.

20:44.591 --> 20:46.506
"'Oh, you can't help that,'
said the Cat.

20:46.549 --> 20:48.682
"'We're all mad.

20:48.725 --> 20:50.684
"I'm mad. You're mad.'

20:50.727 --> 20:54.731
"'But how do you know I'm mad?'
said Alice.

20:54.775 --> 20:56.690
'You must be,' said the Cat."

20:56.733 --> 20:58.082
He is regressing.

20:58.126 --> 21:01.738
If Spock relinquishes all logic,
he's lost.

21:01.782 --> 21:03.044
BURNHAM:
Father.

21:04.567 --> 21:06.656
I believe this is connected
to the Red Angel.

21:06.700 --> 21:08.789
Spock saw it.

21:08.832 --> 21:12.532
And the seven signals,
before they appeared to us.

21:12.575 --> 21:13.881
You hid this from me.

21:13.924 --> 21:15.143
I wanted to find him first.

21:15.186 --> 21:16.579
I was trying to save his life.

21:18.842 --> 21:22.542
Amanda, you
are correct.

21:22.585 --> 21:24.848
Spock needs help,

21:24.892 --> 21:29.070
which is why youmust deliver
him to Captain Leland.

21:29.113 --> 21:31.464
Throwing him at the mercy
of Section 31

21:31.507 --> 21:34.075
might be throwing him
to the wolves.

21:34.118 --> 21:36.556
You want to deliver our son to
the people that are after him?

21:36.599 --> 21:40.211
The sole reason they must be
after Spock is because his mind

21:40.255 --> 21:43.911
contains answers the Federation
desperately needs.

21:43.954 --> 21:45.652
Outside of this room,

21:45.695 --> 21:49.569
no one is more
motivated to heal Spock

21:49.612 --> 21:51.919
than Section 31.

21:51.962 --> 21:53.921
And what are they gonna do
when they're done with him?

21:53.964 --> 21:56.184
Lock him in jail
and throw away the key?

21:56.227 --> 21:57.707
Not if he is innocent.

21:57.751 --> 21:59.753
And there is another
logical reason

21:59.796 --> 22:02.669
Michael must do this.

22:02.712 --> 22:04.671
Your career
as a Starfleet officer

22:04.714 --> 22:06.934
will be jeopardized once again

22:06.977 --> 22:09.806
if you fail
to fulfill your duty.

22:09.850 --> 22:12.940
SPOCK:
...view on the nature
of philosophical questions.

22:12.983 --> 22:16.335
And I am not prepared

22:16.378 --> 22:20.643
to lose both of our
children on the same day.

22:24.821 --> 22:26.780
...the framework of this system,

22:26.823 --> 22:28.434
the relation
of logical sequence is...

22:28.477 --> 22:30.653
PIKE:
Status report, Mr. Tyler.

22:30.697 --> 22:32.786
Plasma levels at 30%,
shields down to 23.

22:32.829 --> 22:34.440
We're circling closer
to the aperture.

22:34.483 --> 22:36.224
So you got what you came for.

22:36.267 --> 22:37.486
How's that?

22:37.530 --> 22:39.880
Dire straits, high stakes.

22:39.923 --> 22:41.795
Low probability
of surfacing.

22:41.838 --> 22:43.449
And the bonus
of taking me down with you.

22:43.492 --> 22:44.972
I am trying to get us
out of here.

22:45.015 --> 22:47.496
Arguing with each other
isn't going to make it...

22:51.457 --> 22:53.850
What is that?

22:57.854 --> 22:59.378
It's our probe.

23:00.944 --> 23:02.772
But somehow
it got an upgrade.

23:13.130 --> 23:14.784
BURNHAM:
N-C-I-A-9-3, do you read?

23:14.828 --> 23:16.656
I'm Commander Michael Burnham,
and my passenger,

23:16.699 --> 23:19.006
Lieutenant Spock, requires
immediate medical attention.

23:19.049 --> 23:21.182
MAN:
Alter course to 1-3-1-mark-7

23:21.225 --> 23:22.792
and power down your thrusters.

23:22.836 --> 23:24.620
SPOCK :
8-4-1-9-4-7.

23:24.664 --> 23:27.449
8-4-1-9-4-7. 8-4-1-9-4-7.

23:27.493 --> 23:29.320
8-4-1-9-4-7.

23:29.364 --> 23:31.627
8-4-1-9-4-7. 8-4-1-9-4-7.

23:31.671 --> 23:32.976
GEORGIOU:
I'm impressed

23:33.020 --> 23:34.456
you found Spock
before we did,

23:34.500 --> 23:37.851
and that you used your
own mother to do it.

23:37.894 --> 23:41.289
I would have enjoyed
manipulating mine like that.

23:41.332 --> 23:44.597
If she'd lived
a little longer.

23:44.640 --> 23:46.686
Did you kill her?

23:46.729 --> 23:48.688
It's a blur.

23:48.731 --> 23:50.646
LELAND:
We've given Commander Spock

23:50.690 --> 23:52.822
a sedative for this procedure.

23:54.041 --> 23:55.999
Captain Leland, what is that?

23:56.043 --> 23:58.785
It allows us to scan and repair
Spock's neural impulses.

23:58.828 --> 24:00.526
Control wouldn't proceed

24:00.569 --> 24:02.484
if there was any risk
to your brother.

24:04.530 --> 24:05.661
Give us the room, please.

24:09.709 --> 24:11.232
That includes you.

24:18.500 --> 24:20.633
I hope Spock is innocent.

24:20.676 --> 24:23.766
If he isn't, my gut tells me
he may not have been himself.

24:23.810 --> 24:25.725
I know how painful
this is for you.

24:25.768 --> 24:27.988
You need answers.
So do we.

24:29.206 --> 24:30.773
We will find them together.

24:30.817 --> 24:32.558
I made that promise
to Ambassador Sarek,

24:32.601 --> 24:35.474
and I'm making you
the same promise.

24:38.215 --> 24:40.435
Thank you, Captain.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.437
Is there anything
you can tell us about

24:42.481 --> 24:45.832
your brother's psychological
makeup that may help us?

24:48.878 --> 24:52.360
He's brilliant, curious.

24:55.494 --> 24:58.453
When he was little, he seemed
to have fewer filters.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.150
Everything reached him.

25:00.194 --> 25:02.501
My mother said he
had a condition

25:02.544 --> 25:06.374
called L'tak Teraias a child.

25:06.417 --> 25:07.810
I've heard the term.

25:07.854 --> 25:09.812
It's a spatial and order
dysphagia.

25:09.856 --> 25:11.858
Much like dyslexia.

25:11.901 --> 25:13.076
Pretty common on Earth.

25:13.120 --> 25:16.340
Not so much on Vulcan.

25:16.384 --> 25:18.560
I received permission
from Admiral Cornwell

25:18.604 --> 25:19.953
to extend your leave.

25:19.996 --> 25:23.434
However, our facilities
are classified.

25:23.478 --> 25:25.567
Section 31 doesn't allow
non-assigned personnel

25:25.611 --> 25:27.221
to stay on board.

25:27.264 --> 25:29.136
I'd rather not
leave him alone, sir.

25:29.179 --> 25:30.790
You won't be.

25:30.833 --> 25:33.880
He'll get the best care
the Federation has to offer.

25:33.923 --> 25:36.839
We both need him
to get better, Burnham.

25:36.883 --> 25:40.974
Look, we're less than four hours
away from Starbase 23.

25:41.017 --> 25:44.107
Spock will be with the doctors
until then, anyway.

25:44.151 --> 25:45.500
Go ahead to the Starbase.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.546
Get a bit of rest.

25:54.814 --> 25:59.775
Listen, the best thing you can
do for your brother right now

25:59.819 --> 26:01.995
is to take care
of yourself.

26:03.039 --> 26:05.607
He's gonna need you.

26:08.784 --> 26:11.744
Spock, can you hear me?

26:20.840 --> 26:23.103
L'tak Terai...

26:25.192 --> 26:28.108
You must have been so lonely.

26:33.635 --> 26:36.333
Knowing you, you made

26:36.377 --> 26:40.468
something beautiful
out of those mirrored images.

26:41.730 --> 26:43.036
8-4-1-9-4-7.

26:43.079 --> 26:44.341
8-4-1-9-4-7.

26:44.385 --> 26:45.473
8-4-1-9-4-7.

26:45.516 --> 26:46.909
SPOCK AND BURNHAM:
8-4-1-9-4-7.

26:46.953 --> 26:48.171
7-4-9...

26:48.215 --> 26:49.259
BURNHAM:
1-4-8.

26:49.303 --> 26:52.262
The numbers are backwards.

26:52.306 --> 26:54.438
The numbers
are backwards.

26:54.482 --> 26:56.963
Sir, I found something.

26:58.138 --> 27:01.532
Residual traces of three
deuterium plasma burns.

27:01.576 --> 27:03.056
I think it's the captain.

27:03.099 --> 27:04.448
Well, why burn off valuable fuel

27:04.492 --> 27:06.059
if you are being
pulled into a rift?

27:06.102 --> 27:07.408
It's an old trick they taught us
in flight school

27:07.451 --> 27:09.105
to alert search parties.

27:09.149 --> 27:11.804
Figured it's something a
former test pilot would do.

27:11.847 --> 27:13.457
Well done, Mr. Rhys.

27:13.501 --> 27:16.112
Send those positions
to Commander Stamets.

27:16.156 --> 27:18.462
STAMETS:
I'm calculating
the shuttle's trajectory.

27:18.506 --> 27:19.768
Not in three-dimensional space,

27:19.812 --> 27:21.204
but using
corresponding coordinates

27:21.248 --> 27:22.641
within the mycelial network.

27:22.684 --> 27:24.338
Well, my fourth-dimensional
math must be off.

27:24.381 --> 27:26.383
This looks like
you just sprayed the monitor

27:26.427 --> 27:28.385
with grated Parmesan.

27:28.429 --> 27:31.954
This plasma burn looks
like it happened a week ago,

27:31.998 --> 27:34.522
this one yesterday,
and the third one...

27:34.565 --> 27:36.698
Eight minutes from now.
No, your math is spot-on.

27:36.742 --> 27:39.353
Nonlinear temporal progression
is a mind bender.

27:40.397 --> 27:42.138
Oh. That's not good.

27:42.182 --> 27:43.966
It's drifting toward
the rift's aperture.

27:44.010 --> 27:45.489
Well, why would it do that?

27:45.533 --> 27:46.969
Well, the currents in there
work like water

27:47.013 --> 27:48.188
swirling down a drain.

27:48.231 --> 27:49.798
The temporal distortions

27:49.842 --> 27:53.062
make spatial orientation
meaningless to the human brain.

27:53.106 --> 27:55.021
Unless...

27:55.064 --> 27:57.719
you have Tardigrade DNA.

27:57.763 --> 27:59.155
Come on, Tilly.

27:59.199 --> 28:01.027
PIKE:
Engaging external shielding.

28:01.070 --> 28:02.811
It's trying to
find a way in.

28:02.855 --> 28:04.247
Some of the metals
in this thing

28:04.291 --> 28:05.814
don't even register
on the periodic chart.

28:05.858 --> 28:09.339
And atomic decay measurements
indicate the probe's core

28:09.383 --> 28:12.908
has aged... 500 years.

28:14.605 --> 28:17.434
So, what, it-it traveled
500 years in the future,

28:17.478 --> 28:19.262
someone messed with it
and sent it back to us?

28:19.306 --> 28:20.873
Yeah. But why?

28:29.490 --> 28:30.709
Tyler!

28:34.234 --> 28:35.278
No!

28:35.322 --> 28:36.976
Hold still.

28:54.341 --> 28:55.559
Where are we going?To the transporter room.

28:55.603 --> 28:56.560
I need to be on that shuttle.

28:56.604 --> 28:58.475
I can fly them out. Move!

28:58.519 --> 29:00.739
Sorry, but calculating
transporter coordinates

29:00.782 --> 29:04.481
from here onto a moving shuttle
inside of a temporal distortion?

29:04.525 --> 29:07.049
It doesn't look distorted to
me, Tilly. It's just anomalous.

29:07.093 --> 29:08.485
But if your
calculations are off

29:08.529 --> 29:10.096
by even a fraction,
you will end up...
Very dead,

29:10.139 --> 29:13.099
which is why you'll be running
the transporter on my mark.

29:13.142 --> 29:15.362
Oh, man, I knew
you were gonna say that.

29:15.405 --> 29:17.581
No, w-w-wait, can-can
we just stop for a second

29:17.625 --> 29:18.887
and think about this?

29:18.931 --> 29:20.715
What if we send
the PADD over first

29:20.759 --> 29:22.412
and see if it...We don't have time.

29:22.456 --> 29:23.849
In one minute,
the shuttle will leave

29:23.892 --> 29:25.764
the triangulation zone
and we'll never

29:25.807 --> 29:27.940
be able to find it again.Right, but, no...

29:27.983 --> 29:29.811
There must be another...Tilly.

29:29.855 --> 29:31.465
Trust the math.

29:31.508 --> 29:33.946
More importantly,
trust yourself.

29:33.989 --> 29:36.644
I wouldn't let just anyone
beam me in and out of time.

29:36.687 --> 29:38.777
Okay.

29:55.184 --> 29:55.924
Captain.

29:55.968 --> 29:57.839
Excuse me.Stamets?

29:57.883 --> 29:59.406
I'm actually here
ten minutes from now.

29:59.449 --> 30:00.886
Admittedly confusing, but

30:00.929 --> 30:02.626
don't worry, I'm gonna
get us out of here

30:02.670 --> 30:04.237
by using the network
as a road map.

30:05.238 --> 30:08.067
Mm. Oh.

30:08.110 --> 30:10.069
Did it work?
Is Commander Stamets all right?

30:10.112 --> 30:12.854
I've got the shuttle.
It's exiting the anomaly.

30:12.898 --> 30:14.247
On screen.

30:21.907 --> 30:24.648
What... is that?

30:24.692 --> 30:26.563
STAMETS:
Discovery,this is Stamets.

30:26.607 --> 30:29.305
We've picked up a hitchhiker;
it's a probe

30:29.349 --> 30:30.611
but with a few
modifications.

30:30.654 --> 30:33.048
And in addition
to it trying to kill us,

30:33.092 --> 30:35.398
it's accessing our
ship's data core.

30:35.442 --> 30:37.096
Yellow alert.We have your,
uh, shuttle screens

30:37.139 --> 30:38.271
mirrored here, sir-- whoa.

30:38.314 --> 30:40.099
The probe is searching
our computers

30:40.142 --> 30:43.102
at incredible speeds;
I will attempt to lock it out.

30:43.145 --> 30:44.146
PIKE:
We'll try on our end.

30:44.190 --> 30:45.234
Grab the Fahrenheit tools.

30:45.278 --> 30:47.497
Rhys, can you target
the probe

30:47.541 --> 30:48.934
without destroying
the shuttle?

30:48.977 --> 30:50.065
Not with your shields so low.

30:50.109 --> 30:51.284
Can we beam them out?

30:51.327 --> 30:52.589
They're too near the rift to get

30:52.633 --> 30:54.156
a lock, sir.

30:54.200 --> 30:55.854
Hold on, I'll move us
closer to Discovery.

31:01.990 --> 31:04.123
Plasma's gone. We're in drift.

31:04.166 --> 31:06.516
It's pulling us
back into the rift.

31:15.351 --> 31:17.310
I've disabled
the cameras

31:17.353 --> 31:19.573
for 60 seconds,
so listen closely.

31:19.616 --> 31:21.401
Your instincts are
correct, Michael.

31:21.444 --> 31:24.360
That machine is a
memory extractor.

31:24.404 --> 31:25.796
It will destroy
your brother's mind.

31:25.840 --> 31:27.233
Why should I believe you?

31:27.276 --> 31:29.670
Leland is just a puppet
following orders.

31:29.713 --> 31:30.932
And I didn't
think you'd want

31:30.976 --> 31:32.934
your brother's
blood on your hands.

31:32.978 --> 31:35.197
So you're telling me this out
of the goodness of your heart?

31:35.241 --> 31:36.720
No, the goodness of yours.

31:36.764 --> 31:39.680
I know so much more about
you than you can imagine.

31:39.723 --> 31:41.377
But that's for
another time.

31:41.421 --> 31:44.250
Right now,
you're going to attack me,

31:44.293 --> 31:47.470
then rescue Spock,
which is good for you.

31:47.514 --> 31:48.863
And that will make
Leland look bad,

31:48.907 --> 31:50.473
which is good for me.

31:50.517 --> 31:52.084
Ten seconds, Michael.

31:52.127 --> 31:53.433
So, what will it...?

31:55.826 --> 31:57.132
Trying to make it look good.

31:57.176 --> 31:58.525
Not bad.

31:58.568 --> 32:00.962
Once more, with feeling.

32:36.955 --> 32:38.565
SARU:
Captain Pike, we cannot get
a transporter lock

32:38.608 --> 32:40.001
for you on our end,
and we will lose you

32:40.045 --> 32:41.002
to the rift in 34 seconds.

32:41.046 --> 32:42.743
Commander, can you calculate

32:42.786 --> 32:44.223
the transporter coordinates
for Discoveryremotely?

32:44.266 --> 32:45.528
Uh... probably?

32:45.572 --> 32:49.576
Great. Saru, I'm blowing
up the shuttle manually.

32:49.619 --> 32:51.143
Engaging self-destruct sequence.

32:51.186 --> 32:52.579
Better hurry with those
calculations, Mr. Stamets.

32:52.622 --> 32:55.147
STAMETS:
Sending
transport coordinates now.

32:55.190 --> 32:57.410
Coordinates received.
Standing by to transport.

32:57.453 --> 32:58.759
Self-destruct activated.

32:58.802 --> 33:01.675
STAMETS:
Owo! Beam us out.
Owo, beam us out!

33:01.718 --> 33:03.242
Now, now, now, now,
now, now, now!

33:17.125 --> 33:19.954
SARU :
Commander Airiam, are they safe?

33:19.998 --> 33:21.521
Commander Airiam,
are they safe?

33:25.003 --> 33:26.004
Commander Airiam?

33:28.180 --> 33:30.660
They are securely on board.

33:38.233 --> 33:40.105
FEMALE VOICE :
Attention, all personnel.

33:40.148 --> 33:42.803
Security breach
in main shuttle bay.

33:42.846 --> 33:45.458
Security breach
to the shuttle bay.

33:45.501 --> 33:48.156
Standard detainment protocols
remain in...

34:02.692 --> 34:05.347
Thank you, Mr. Saru.

34:05.391 --> 34:08.524
Thank you, everyone, for, uh...

34:08.568 --> 34:09.917
well, our lives.

34:09.960 --> 34:11.310
Don't thank us yet, sir.

34:11.353 --> 34:13.138
A shockwave from
the shuttle explosion

34:13.181 --> 34:16.358
is about to hit us
with a... time tsunami.

34:16.402 --> 34:18.186
That one's not as
cool as it sounds.

34:18.230 --> 34:20.406
Detmer, maximum warp.
Get us out of here.

34:20.449 --> 34:22.016
Aye, sir.

34:31.112 --> 34:34.114
It's good to be back
in the chair.

34:34.159 --> 34:36.900
You should probably get that
checked out.

34:36.944 --> 34:40.034
On Qo'noS, we wouldn't even
bother to bandage it.

34:40.078 --> 34:42.471
You know...

34:42.514 --> 34:44.081
if it wasn't for you,

34:44.125 --> 34:46.170
that think would've
sliced me in two.

34:46.214 --> 34:48.042
Just... instinct.

34:48.085 --> 34:49.478
No, it's more than that,

34:49.522 --> 34:51.001
and I am grateful.

34:51.045 --> 34:53.482
And, Mr. Tyler,

34:53.525 --> 34:58.183
you may have been right
about why I, uh...

34:58.226 --> 35:01.621
why I gave myself
the mission.

35:01.664 --> 35:04.580
And a few others,
if I'm being honest.

35:06.321 --> 35:08.280
Your plasma burn was
the right call, sir.

35:08.323 --> 35:11.718
Like you said,
you were the most qualified.

35:11.761 --> 35:14.373
Mr. Saru, have you analyzed

35:14.416 --> 35:15.852
the probe's attack
on our systems?

35:15.896 --> 35:17.898
Well, analyzing, sir.

35:17.941 --> 35:20.857
It will take us time to discover
what it was looking for.

35:20.901 --> 35:23.512
That probe came from the future
and tried to kill us.

35:23.556 --> 35:26.124
The Red Angel comes
from the future.

35:26.167 --> 35:28.343
Captain, are you suggesting
it may share

35:28.387 --> 35:30.040
the probe's hostile intent?

35:30.084 --> 35:32.608
Mr. Tyler has broached
that possibility before,

35:32.652 --> 35:37.265
and today I think
he might have a point.

35:37.309 --> 35:39.224
Whether the Red Angel is
here to end something

35:39.267 --> 35:44.098
or start something,
one thing's for sure.

35:44.142 --> 35:45.621
We're in the middle
of a fight for the future.

35:45.665 --> 35:47.145
Always, Mr. Tyler.

35:47.188 --> 35:50.670
We are always in a fight
for the future.

36:00.332 --> 36:01.898
LELAND:
You let her go.

36:01.942 --> 36:03.900
She overpowered me.
Check the cameras.

36:03.944 --> 36:05.467
Where is she taking Spock?

36:05.511 --> 36:07.121
They're family.
Maybe they're going

36:07.165 --> 36:09.297
on a picnic.

36:09.341 --> 36:11.908
Georgiou...

36:11.952 --> 36:15.216
do not overestimate
your value here.

36:15.260 --> 36:17.305
Who do you think
you're fooling, Leland?

36:17.349 --> 36:21.875
You need me... to keep Burnham
from finding out the truth.

36:25.618 --> 36:28.229
The truth?

36:28.273 --> 36:31.972
You're responsible for
the death of her parents.

36:33.103 --> 36:34.366
Mind your manners.

36:34.409 --> 36:37.804
You're no longer
calling the shots.

36:45.290 --> 36:48.162
MAN:
Sectors 0-1-4 and 0-1-5
report all clear.

36:48.206 --> 36:52.079
Sensors are picking up elevated EM interference in 0-1-6.

36:52.122 --> 36:54.690
WOMAN:
Clear, 0-1-6. Let's move on.

36:54.734 --> 36:56.736
MAN:
Acknowledged.

37:05.658 --> 37:09.052
COMPUTER:
Section 31 ships
beyond sensor range.

37:13.666 --> 37:14.841
8-4-1-9-4-7.

37:14.884 --> 37:16.016
Spock, can you hear me?

37:16.059 --> 37:17.670
8-4-1-9-4-7.

37:18.714 --> 37:20.803
8-4-1-9-4-7.

37:20.847 --> 37:22.327
9-4-7.

37:22.370 --> 37:24.111
Computer, search
database for matches

37:24.154 --> 37:25.155
with the following numbers:

37:25.199 --> 37:27.593
7-4-9-1-4-8, in that order.

37:27.636 --> 37:30.117
COMPUTER:
Working.

37:30.160 --> 37:31.510
Give me everything you have.

37:35.557 --> 37:40.823
"Either the well was very deep,

37:40.867 --> 37:42.869
"or she fell very slowly.

37:42.912 --> 37:47.526
For she had plenty of time
as she went down..."

37:47.569 --> 37:49.702
COMPUTER:
Working... working...

37:49.745 --> 37:52.792
"...to wonder what was going
to happen next."

37:52.835 --> 37:55.316
What are you trying
to say?

37:55.360 --> 37:56.883
Talk to me.

37:56.926 --> 37:59.973
COMPUTER:
Database match found.

38:00.016 --> 38:04.064
One planetary system,
located at 7-4-9-mark-1-4-8.

38:04.107 --> 38:06.893
Identification: Talos Four.

38:12.420 --> 38:14.596
They were coordinates.

38:17.599 --> 38:20.733
Computer, set course
for Talos Four.

38:20.776 --> 38:22.300
Maximum warp.

38:26.869 --> 38:29.263
Where are you taking us, Spock?
