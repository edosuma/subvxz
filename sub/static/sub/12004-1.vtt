00:14.373 --> 00:16.074
Excellent tongue
control, liam.

00:16.109 --> 00:18.076
It's'soo'sto knowwfofooufor.

00:18.111 --> 00:21.947
- Watch it, bay.
- Yeah, bay, watch it.

00:21.981 --> 00:24.049
<i>Okay, let's begin
our blood type test.</i>

00:24.083 --> 00:26.051
<i>Use the needle
to prick a drop of blood</i>

00:26.085 --> 00:29.121
<i>Onto the four fields
on your test cards.</i>

00:29.155 --> 00:31.256
Aah!

00:35.228 --> 00:37.195
<i>Apparently
it's extremely rare.</i>

00:37.230 --> 00:39.364
Only 1 %
of the population
is a-b.

00:39.398 --> 00:42.200
I have lacrosse
practice tomorrow,
so I can't drive bay.

00:42.235 --> 00:45.003
Honey, you can't be a-b
because your mother
and I are both a,

00:45.037 --> 00:47.305
Which means you have
to be either a or o.

00:47.340 --> 00:50.075
Well, it said a-b,
and blood don't lie.

00:50.109 --> 00:51.343
I'm taking the mercedes
tomorrow, okay?

00:51.377 --> 00:53.345
I'm telling you
it's genetically
impossible.

00:53.379 --> 00:56.314
Well, maybe I'm some
super-human mutant freak
from another planet.

00:56.349 --> 00:58.984
- Or a vampire.
- Oh, how awesome
would that be?

00:59.018 --> 01:00.285
Toby, you may have
a point there.

01:00.319 --> 01:02.053
Your mother once had
a deep fascination

01:02.088 --> 01:03.922
With a mail carrier
with snaggly teeth.

01:03.956 --> 01:05.957
I do not have
snaggly teeth.

01:05.992 --> 01:08.093
- You do have that one.
- Ha.

01:08.127 --> 01:10.162
Toby was barely two
when I got pregnant
with bay.

01:10.196 --> 01:12.130
I was far too exhausted
to have an affair.

01:12.165 --> 01:14.132
And besides,
my grandmother
was italian.

01:14.167 --> 01:17.302
- That's where bay gets
her beautiful coloring from.
- Beautiful.

01:17.336 --> 01:20.038
It has to be
a mistake, sweetie.

01:23.409 --> 01:27.445
<i>♪ I should be
feelin' more ♪</i>

01:29.215 --> 01:34.252
<i>♪ I should be
writing words... ♪</i>

01:34.287 --> 01:37.289
<i>- Look, another one.
♪ I should be
crying tears... ♪</i>

01:37.323 --> 01:39.291
<i>I wish I knew
who was doing it.</i>

01:39.325 --> 01:41.193
- I know you think
that's art.
- It is art.

01:41.227 --> 01:42.994
It's graffiti.

01:43.029 --> 01:45.263
What if we all ran around
with spray cans?

01:45.298 --> 01:47.199
- But obviously
that doesn't happen.
- Good thing.

01:48.467 --> 01:51.203
Why do you think we see
things differently
all the time?

01:51.237 --> 01:52.337
Well, you're a teenager.

01:52.371 --> 01:55.140
It's your job
to disagree with me.

01:55.174 --> 01:59.044
But we've always
been different,
really different.

01:59.078 --> 02:01.112
I don't think
that's true, baby.

02:01.147 --> 02:04.182
Mom, we look nothing alike.
Look at our hair.

02:04.217 --> 02:07.285
Look at our hands.
Look at our bodies.

02:07.320 --> 02:11.957
- Was I adopted or something?
- You were not adopted.

02:11.991 --> 02:14.292
People ask me that--
a lot of people.

02:14.327 --> 02:16.394
Who?
I'll show them
my stretch marks.

02:18.965 --> 02:21.266
If I wanted you
to do something,

02:21.300 --> 02:25.203
Even if you thought
it was crazy...

02:25.238 --> 02:27.138
Would you?

02:30.243 --> 02:34.045
<i>♪ How could
I love you? ♪</i>

02:36.015 --> 02:37.949
We've done extensive

02:37.984 --> 02:40.151
12-marker testing
on all three of you.

02:40.186 --> 02:44.155
<i>It is 99.9 % certain</i>

02:44.190 --> 02:48.260
That bay is not
related to you.

02:48.294 --> 02:51.229
- I knew it.
- The hospital believes
there was a mix-up.

02:51.264 --> 02:53.198
Did they actually use
that word-- mix-up?

02:53.232 --> 02:55.267
Someone wasn't careful
matching the I.D. Anklets.

02:55.301 --> 02:59.170
It's extremely rare,
but it happens.

02:59.205 --> 03:01.973
You took home
someone else's baby

03:02.008 --> 03:05.377
<i>And another family
took home yours.</i>

03:07.947 --> 03:11.316
<i>- It's a lot
to take in, I know.
- Yes, it is a lot to take in.</i>

03:11.350 --> 03:14.152
Would you just tell us
what the procedure is
going forward?

03:14.186 --> 03:18.089
You find your real daughter,
I find my real parents.

03:18.124 --> 03:21.159
We say "biological,"
not "real."

03:21.193 --> 03:23.094
Who could these people be?

03:23.129 --> 03:25.163
And what would
they expect from us?
- Yeah, who are they?

03:25.197 --> 03:27.098
<i>Where do I come from?
- Just hold on
one second.</i>

03:27.133 --> 03:30.368
Does anybody know where
this other child might be?

03:42.381 --> 03:44.382
Hello?

04:00.066 --> 04:03.068
<i>John and kathryn kennish,
regina vasquez.</i>

04:03.102 --> 04:06.037
- Hello.
- John kennish.
Nice to meet you.

04:06.072 --> 04:08.039
Nice to meet you.

04:12.378 --> 04:14.346
Hi.

04:14.380 --> 04:17.015
Daphne, this is bay.

04:17.048 --> 04:19.250
<i>Bay, daphne.</i>

04:19.285 --> 04:23.154
It's nice to meet you.

04:39.258 --> 04:42.827
What was he again? A
pitcher? First baseman?

04:42.862 --> 04:45.063
Third base for the royals.

04:45.097 --> 04:47.165
Now he owns like
seven car washes.

04:47.200 --> 04:49.167
Rough life.

04:49.202 --> 04:51.036
Put your name on a sign

04:51.070 --> 04:53.171
And sit around
and collect dough.

05:02.148 --> 05:05.984
I'm so glad
you found it.

05:07.954 --> 05:11.823
Daphne, this is toby.

05:11.857 --> 05:14.125
- Hey.
- Nice to meet you.

05:14.160 --> 05:15.927
You two sure look alike.

05:15.962 --> 05:18.730
Now matter how loud you yell,
she still can't hear you.

05:18.764 --> 05:20.098
Right, of course.

05:20.132 --> 05:22.067
Just face her
and talk normally--

05:22.101 --> 05:23.935
Not too fast,
not too slow.

05:23.970 --> 05:25.870
It's okay.
Everyone does it.

05:25.905 --> 05:27.739
I gotta go.
Hey, sorry. Hi.

05:27.773 --> 05:31.243
We're opening up
two new car washes
and it's just been crazy.

05:33.179 --> 05:35.213
I can't believe you own
kennish car wash.

05:35.248 --> 05:37.749
- We used to go there.
- Oh.

05:37.783 --> 05:40.852
I can't understand her.
- My friend emmett
is dying to meet you.

05:40.886 --> 05:45.056
- He's a huge royals fan.
- Well, let's go to a game.

05:47.927 --> 05:52.097
- So, shall we go have lunch?
- Yes, let's-- let's go in.

05:52.131 --> 05:54.132
Be nice.

05:58.871 --> 06:03.074
I made chicken enchiladas,
so save room, okay?

06:03.109 --> 06:04.909
Oh, actually
I'm a vegetarian.

06:04.944 --> 06:07.012
But it's okay.
I always find something.

06:07.046 --> 06:08.913
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

06:08.948 --> 06:11.750
When daphne was 11,
I dated a guy

06:11.784 --> 06:13.118
Who managed
a chicken plant

06:13.152 --> 06:16.021
And the stories
we heard were...

06:26.165 --> 06:29.100
Well, I think eating
vegetarian is great.

06:29.135 --> 06:31.036
You hunt.

06:31.070 --> 06:34.973
Well, there was that one time
with the guys from the team.

06:35.007 --> 06:38.810
Right, that one time.

06:38.844 --> 06:42.080
So, daphne, are you
allergic to anything?

06:42.114 --> 06:45.817
- Toby and I both break out
into hives whenever we eat--
- kiwi.

06:45.851 --> 06:48.086
Yes!
Isn't that amazing?

06:48.120 --> 06:51.056
Bay isn't allergic
to anything, but picky.

06:51.090 --> 06:54.859
As a baby she went
nothing but carrots--

06:54.894 --> 06:57.162
<i>- Orange poo.
- Thanks, mom.</i>

06:57.196 --> 07:00.165
That's classy.

07:00.199 --> 07:03.068
She was such
a cute baby.

07:03.102 --> 07:05.737
<i>I bet you were
a cute baby too.</i>

07:05.771 --> 07:07.806
So, um, you all live
in east riverside?

07:07.840 --> 07:11.776
Yes. It's near
a lake and a park

07:11.811 --> 07:15.013
And it's very diverse,
which I think is important.

07:15.047 --> 07:18.817
- Definitely definitely.
- Yes, of course.

07:20.186 --> 07:22.187
Are you mexican?

07:25.057 --> 07:27.092
Puerto rican...
On my mother's side.

07:27.126 --> 07:29.761
<i>She named her, actually.</i>

07:29.795 --> 07:32.831
Daphne paloma,
after my father daniel.

07:32.865 --> 07:35.734
Daphne paloma vasquez--
yeah, that definitely fits

07:35.768 --> 07:37.001
Better than
bay madeleine kennish.

07:37.036 --> 07:39.738
I think bay
is a beautiful name.

07:39.772 --> 07:43.041
- Of course you do.
- We thought so too.

07:48.781 --> 07:52.117
- Can I use the restroom?
Make yourself at home.

07:52.151 --> 07:54.819
If you need anything,
pretend it's your house.

07:54.854 --> 07:57.822
Because technically it is.

08:02.895 --> 08:06.131
- Sweetie, what are you doing?
- Taking the chicken out.

08:06.165 --> 08:08.900
You can't take chicken
out of chicken enchiladas.

08:08.934 --> 08:11.069
That's our daughter
out there.

08:11.103 --> 08:12.737
- I know.
- That girl.

08:12.772 --> 08:14.172
I know.
It's crazy.

08:14.206 --> 08:16.875
Some nurse spaces out
and suddenly our lives

08:16.909 --> 08:18.843
Are just tossed up
in the air.

08:18.878 --> 08:20.745
They shuffled them.
Kind of mistake? Hat

08:20.780 --> 08:22.947
- We're gonna fix that.
- Yeah? Well, how?

08:22.982 --> 08:25.784
You think that woman's
just gonna hand her over?

08:25.818 --> 08:27.118
And what about our bay?

08:27.153 --> 08:29.120
What if she tries
to get her back from us?

08:29.155 --> 08:31.890
- She's not gonna try
- can I help? Ack from--

08:31.924 --> 08:33.158
- Uh, no.
- No.

08:33.192 --> 08:35.927
We're just taking
the chicken out--

09:05.991 --> 09:08.059
Hi. I-- I just--

09:08.093 --> 09:11.095
Mom, I'm out of here.

09:11.130 --> 09:14.732
Would you show daphne around?
See if she needs anything?

09:14.767 --> 09:16.000
I don't need anything.

09:16.035 --> 09:18.703
She doesn't need
anything.

09:18.737 --> 09:21.039
I think
it would be nice.

09:21.073 --> 09:23.074
Okay then.

09:25.144 --> 09:27.846
Let's take a tour.

09:34.086 --> 09:38.990
Tennis courts,
gazebo,

09:39.024 --> 09:42.927
Concrete dogs--
every house needs them.

09:48.734 --> 09:52.136
Guest house,
basketball court,

09:52.171 --> 09:55.106
Garage bay uses
for her "art."

10:01.714 --> 10:05.149
- One on one?
- Okay.

10:12.925 --> 10:14.926
You can talk
as much trash
as you want--

10:14.960 --> 10:17.695
I can't see your lips,
I can't hear you.

10:17.730 --> 10:19.731
Whoo!

10:21.834 --> 10:23.701
Magic.

10:23.736 --> 10:26.838
So, um, how did--
how did daphne go...

10:26.872 --> 10:28.139
<i>- It's okay.
...Deaf?</i>

10:28.173 --> 10:30.008
It's not a bad word.

10:30.042 --> 10:32.710
She got meningitis
when she was three.

10:32.745 --> 10:35.046
- And the hearing aid?
- She can hear some
ambient noise.

10:35.080 --> 10:38.116
It helps her know
what's going on around her,
but it can't make her hear.

10:38.150 --> 10:40.885
She needs to see your lips
to know what you're saying.

10:40.920 --> 10:42.954
And how did she get
the meningitis?

10:44.890 --> 10:48.793
It's a bacteria.
She caught it.

10:48.827 --> 10:50.962
- And she goes to school
and everything?
- Yes.

10:50.996 --> 10:54.032
It's just her ears
that don't work,
not her brain.

10:54.066 --> 10:57.035
- Right.
- Bay goes to buckner hall.
It's a wonderful school.

10:57.069 --> 10:59.737
Not that school
is bay's thing.

10:59.772 --> 11:03.675
Yeah, well--
but she loves
photography and art.

11:03.709 --> 11:07.679
<i>Music-- she loves music.</i>

11:07.713 --> 11:11.683
Yeah, excuse me.
Um, ahem.

11:11.717 --> 11:14.919
Bay, bay,
turn it down!
Thank you!

11:14.954 --> 11:18.823
Ever since she found out,
it's just been hard on her.

11:18.857 --> 11:21.659
Look, we-- you know,
we just want to get
to know daphne.

11:21.694 --> 11:23.995
I'm sure you want
to get to know bay, so...

11:24.029 --> 11:26.064
I don't know-- we could
have weekly lunches

11:26.098 --> 11:28.700
Or, if you want,
go through the courts--
whatever.

11:28.734 --> 11:30.768
I really think
we should have a plan--

11:30.803 --> 11:33.738
I think the girls
have had enough change
for one week.

11:33.772 --> 11:36.107
I say we give everyone
a minute to take it in, huh?

11:36.141 --> 11:38.977
We've lost
so much time already.

11:41.080 --> 11:43.781
Exactly how long
do you want us to wait?

11:43.816 --> 11:45.783
And it looks like
they're having fun
out there.

11:45.818 --> 11:48.987
So if you have to go,
I'm happy to give her
a ride home.

11:50.990 --> 11:52.991
Perfect.

12:02.801 --> 12:04.869
I'm going.

12:04.903 --> 12:06.938
They'll drive you, okay?

12:20.819 --> 12:23.121
Oh, thank you!

12:24.123 --> 12:26.090
<i>All right.</i>

12:26.125 --> 12:30.094
Oh, I was just gonna
go check and see what
you were up to, honey.

12:33.065 --> 12:35.767
Bay, it's fine.
They're just having fun.

12:35.801 --> 12:37.702
- He's not trying
to displace you.
- No.

12:37.736 --> 12:41.072
I don't feel displaced.
I have plans with liam.

12:41.106 --> 12:45.009
Bay, I know
you know this,

12:45.044 --> 12:47.812
But you're still
our daughter.

12:47.846 --> 12:51.949
We love you as much as we did
before any of this happened.

12:51.984 --> 12:54.085
Nothing's changed.
Nothing.

12:54.119 --> 12:56.921
- Nothing has changed?
- That's right.

12:56.955 --> 13:00.658
I just found out
my middle name's paloma.

13:00.693 --> 13:01.893
I'd probably be
a vegetarian

13:01.927 --> 13:04.962
And I am supposed
to have grown up
in east riverside,

13:04.997 --> 13:07.965
The daughter
of a half-puerto rican
single mother hairdresser.

13:08.000 --> 13:12.804
But aside from that,
nothing's changed.

13:22.681 --> 13:25.049
- I'm totally doing it.
- I think u gotta be 18.

13:25.084 --> 13:27.952
Lucky for me I'm 21.

13:27.986 --> 13:30.855
Bay, if you come home
with a hunk of metal
sticking out of your face,

13:30.889 --> 13:32.623
Your mom is going
to disown you.

13:32.658 --> 13:33.991
So let her.

13:34.026 --> 13:36.828
- Why are you
so hard on people?
- What?

13:36.862 --> 13:39.731
You've been lashing out
at me for weeks and I know
you're mad at your parents.

13:39.765 --> 13:41.699
- So what's going on?
- Nothing's going on.

13:41.734 --> 13:42.967
What do you mean
"nothing's going on"?

13:43.001 --> 13:44.769
People keep asking,
"what's up with
your girlfriend?"

13:44.803 --> 13:46.704
I'm like,
"I have no idea."

13:46.739 --> 13:49.707
- Like I care what some
stupid prep school kids think.
- And what are you, bay?

13:49.742 --> 13:52.110
- Some gangster girl
who's had it rough?
- I think we need a break.

13:52.144 --> 13:55.880
You know what?
Fine, no problem.

13:58.951 --> 14:00.618
<i>I tell you,</i>

14:00.652 --> 14:02.954
I have not been in this
neighborhood for years.

14:02.988 --> 14:05.990
There hasn't
been a murder here
in like three weeks.

14:06.024 --> 14:07.692
I'm kidding.

14:07.726 --> 14:10.027
, That's very funny.

14:17.936 --> 14:20.671
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:20.706 --> 14:23.741
John, this is my mom
adriana.

14:23.776 --> 14:27.011
- Mom, this is john kennish.
- Adriana, very pleased
to meet you.

14:27.045 --> 14:29.747
Suddenly a lot of things
are making sense.

14:29.782 --> 14:32.884
I guess we're all
wondering how the hell
we didn't know, right?

14:36.889 --> 14:38.856
- Nice to see you again.
- Nice to see you.

14:38.891 --> 14:40.992
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

14:42.694 --> 14:44.896
Thank you so much.
That was really fun.

14:44.930 --> 14:47.999
Good.
You come back
any time you want.

14:59.645 --> 15:01.646
Bye.

15:03.916 --> 15:06.784
Oh, hey, daphne,
your sweater.

15:06.819 --> 15:10.588
Hey, sweetie, your sweater.
Daphne, your--

15:53.065 --> 15:57.001
Bars on the windows,
bail bonds on every corner--

15:57.035 --> 16:00.538
- I was nervous.
- We have to get her
out of there.

16:00.572 --> 16:03.941
Yeah.
We will.

16:03.976 --> 16:05.843
<i>Bay?</i>

16:05.878 --> 16:10.815
<i>- Is that you, honey?
- Yeah, mom, it's me...</i>

16:14.953 --> 16:16.954
Whoever that is.

16:22.734 --> 16:23.134
Thank god you're
down here already.

16:24.069 --> 16:26.904
- What are you drinking?
- Coffee. You want some?

16:28.941 --> 16:31.943
- What is in your nose?
- It's a stud.
Isn't it cute?

16:31.977 --> 16:36.147
- You pierced your nose
without asking me?
- Yep.

16:36.181 --> 16:39.183
Bay--
what are you doing?

16:39.218 --> 16:42.854
Just living the life
I was supposed to live.

16:42.888 --> 16:46.858
Get that out of your mouth
and go get your bag!

16:46.892 --> 16:48.893
We're late.

16:53.032 --> 16:55.033
Hey, sorry to barge in.

16:55.067 --> 16:57.035
I just--an I chat
with you about something?

16:57.069 --> 16:58.803
- Okay.
- Thank you.
Thank you so much.

16:58.837 --> 17:01.973
I just heard about this thing
that they implant in the brain

17:02.007 --> 17:03.708
That lets deaf people hear.

17:03.742 --> 17:05.108
- The cochlear implant.
- Yeah, that thing.

17:05.144 --> 17:07.145
That's amazing, right?
So anyway, listen.

17:07.179 --> 17:09.714
I know that the surgery
is very expensive,
but I just--

17:09.748 --> 17:11.848
About 100 grand
with speech therapy
and follow-up.

17:11.884 --> 17:13.785
Yeah, I know, and maybe
it wasn't something

17:13.819 --> 17:16.788
That you were able
to offer daphne, which
I completely understand,

17:16.821 --> 17:18.156
<i>But I just want you
to know that kathryn--</i>

17:18.190 --> 17:21.159
If I had wanted it,
I would have found a way
to get it for her.

17:21.193 --> 17:24.796
Why wouldn't you
want it for her?

17:24.829 --> 17:27.065
You think she needs
to be fixed, right?

17:27.098 --> 17:29.834
Daphne is comfortable
being deaf.

17:29.868 --> 17:33.004
- She likes it.
- Oh, come on.
No one likes being deaf.

17:33.038 --> 17:35.039
The cochlear rewires the brain
to hear electronically.

17:35.074 --> 17:38.176
- It is not a cure.
- It sounds like
a miracle to me.

17:38.210 --> 17:41.946
Even with the cochlear,
listening would always
require work.

17:41.980 --> 17:45.083
- It would always be effort.
- Okay, so it's work.
Isn't it worth it?

17:45.117 --> 17:47.185
The world can hear
and now she can join it.

17:47.219 --> 17:49.153
You just found out
you have this kid

17:49.188 --> 17:52.790
And you want her
to be just like you.
I get it.

17:52.825 --> 17:54.992
But daphne will never
be like you.

17:55.027 --> 17:56.928
The sooner
you accept that,
the sooner--

17:56.962 --> 17:59.097
Wait, hold on.
No no.

17:59.131 --> 18:01.899
I-- I have watched
daphne struggle.

18:01.934 --> 18:04.168
I have watched her struggle
to follow a conversation.

18:04.203 --> 18:06.137
And I know that
if she has this procedure,

18:06.171 --> 18:09.707
She won't have
to read lips anymore
or rely on you or me

18:09.742 --> 18:11.142
Or anybody else
to translate for her.

18:11.176 --> 18:13.945
- Interpret.
- Is that it?

18:15.214 --> 18:17.815
Keeping her deaf keeps her
dependent on you?

18:17.850 --> 18:22.820
I want what's best for her.
She's my daughter.

18:22.855 --> 18:25.890
Yeah, well,
she's my daughter too.

19:12.871 --> 19:17.875
<i>♪ The city seems to be
calling out my name ♪</i>

19:17.910 --> 19:21.712
<i>♪ I've only seen
the pictures, but I... ♪</i>

19:21.747 --> 19:24.015
Hey, move along.
Get out of here.

19:24.049 --> 19:27.785
Excuse me,
this is a free country.
I can park wherever I want.

19:27.820 --> 19:29.887
Yeah well,
it's my neighborhood
and I don't like seeing

19:29.922 --> 19:31.956
Rich white girls slumming it,
looking for dime bags.

19:31.990 --> 19:34.792
I'm not looking for pot
and I'm not a rich white girl.

19:34.827 --> 19:36.727
- Really?
- Really.

19:39.198 --> 19:41.833
Oh, you-- you know
daphne and regina?

19:41.867 --> 19:44.902
- Should I tell them
you stopped by?
- Very funny.

19:44.937 --> 19:47.104
You sure look like
a rich white girl to me.

19:47.139 --> 19:50.174
<i>- "Ceci n'est pas une pipe."
- Say-- say what?</i>

19:50.209 --> 19:52.743
"This is not a pipe."

19:52.778 --> 19:54.912
It's a painting by magritte.

19:54.947 --> 19:56.180
It means your eyes
betray you.

19:56.215 --> 19:58.716
You think you're
looking at a pipe--

19:58.750 --> 20:01.752
You grow up your entire life
thinking that it's a pipe

20:01.787 --> 20:03.921
Because that's what
everyone said that it was.

20:03.956 --> 20:05.723
And then one day
you find out

20:05.757 --> 20:07.124
That it's actually
a frickin' eggplant.

20:07.159 --> 20:09.894
You are a frickin' eggplant
in a pipe world.

20:09.928 --> 20:11.996
I don't know
what that means.

20:12.030 --> 20:14.732
It means I'm clearly
losing it.

20:14.766 --> 20:15.967
I should go.

20:16.001 --> 20:20.137
Um... But I was
never here, okay?

20:20.172 --> 20:23.007
What am I gonna say?

20:23.041 --> 20:26.043
I saw an eggplant in a beemer
casing the place?

20:26.078 --> 20:27.778
Thank you.

20:27.813 --> 20:33.017
<i>♪ 'Cause I can see,

20:33.051 --> 20:38.055
<i>♪ I can hear,

20:42.861 --> 20:44.896
Hey, that was amazing.

20:44.930 --> 20:48.132
- What are you doing here?
- I came to talk to you.
Can we sit down?

20:48.166 --> 20:50.167
- Sure.
- Great.

20:58.210 --> 21:00.144
So you know bay goes
to buckner hall.

21:00.178 --> 21:02.013
You've heard
of that school, right?

21:02.047 --> 21:03.948
It's a really
really good school.

21:03.982 --> 21:08.119
And I know with your grades
and activities you could
definitely get in.

21:08.153 --> 21:10.988
You want me to go
to buckner hall?

21:11.023 --> 21:13.958
Well, I don't think
isolating yourself

21:13.992 --> 21:17.128
In a deaf bubble
is a good idea.

21:17.162 --> 21:19.997
Like let's say you wanted
to be a surgeon, okay?

21:20.032 --> 21:21.899
Would your entire team
have to learn sign

21:21.934 --> 21:23.801
To get instructions from you
every single time?

21:23.835 --> 21:26.938
Because that would be
really-- I'm sorry.

21:26.972 --> 21:31.742
I'm talking too fast.
I'm sorry.

21:31.777 --> 21:35.146
I think you should go
to a regular school

21:35.180 --> 21:37.748
With regular kids.

21:37.783 --> 21:39.884
I really appreciate this,

21:39.918 --> 21:42.753
But I like my friends,
my teachers.

21:42.788 --> 21:43.988
I understand.

21:44.022 --> 21:47.858
We just want you to have
the best education out there

21:47.893 --> 21:51.062
So that you have
every opportunity
open to you.

21:52.798 --> 21:56.100
And, uh-- and then
there's bay, you know.

21:56.134 --> 21:59.036
I think you two should get
to know each other better.

21:59.071 --> 22:01.939
I don't think bay
really wants to get
to know me.

22:01.974 --> 22:04.075
She just takes some time.

22:06.211 --> 22:08.813
- Can I think about it?
- Sure. Sure.

22:08.847 --> 22:11.716
I'll just set up a tour
and we'll go from there.

22:11.750 --> 22:14.018
Okay. I should
get back to practice.

22:14.052 --> 22:18.055
Okay. Oh, just--
just one thing.

22:18.090 --> 22:21.058
I think while
we're working this out,

22:21.093 --> 22:25.096
It would be best
not to tell regina...
For now.

22:34.331 --> 22:36.332
The best of the best.

22:36.367 --> 22:38.067
And daphne,
an interpreter

22:38.102 --> 22:40.437
Would be with you
in all of your classes.

22:54.418 --> 22:56.319
Hey.

22:56.353 --> 22:58.354
Who's that girl
with your parents?

23:02.092 --> 23:04.427
Just some scholarship kid
they're sponsoring.

23:07.998 --> 23:11.367
Is it okay
if I just walk around
on my own for a minute?

23:11.402 --> 23:13.403
- By all means.
- Yeah, absolutely.

23:27.251 --> 23:29.319
You don't go here,
do you?

23:29.353 --> 23:31.988
Just taking a tour.

23:32.022 --> 23:33.423
It's a lot different
than my school.

23:33.457 --> 23:36.326
- Oh, where's that?
- It's called carlton.

23:36.360 --> 23:38.228
It's for deaf kids.
I'm deaf.

23:38.262 --> 23:42.332
- What's your name?
- Liam. Oh wait.

23:45.035 --> 23:47.170
We learned the alphabet
in the first grade.

23:47.204 --> 23:50.206
I'm daphne,
but my name sign is...

23:50.241 --> 23:53.009
- Oh.
- Mine's a sign
for "happy" with a d.

23:53.043 --> 23:54.410
I should have a name sign.

23:54.445 --> 23:56.412
What's the sign
for exceedingly handsome?

23:56.447 --> 23:59.148
You can't name yourself.

23:59.183 --> 24:01.951
It's like a rule.
A deaf person has to do it.

24:01.986 --> 24:04.254
A rule?
Like I can get
into trouble?

24:04.288 --> 24:07.123
- There's a deaf police?
- Yes.

24:09.159 --> 24:11.995
Well, bye,
daphne with a d.

24:12.029 --> 24:14.163
Bye, liam.

24:17.167 --> 24:19.135
When were you planning
on telling me?

24:19.169 --> 24:21.070
What's in your nose?
What's in her nose?

24:21.105 --> 24:23.139
I wanted her
to tell you herself, okay?

24:23.173 --> 24:25.041
- What is that?
She pierced her nose?
- Yes.

24:25.075 --> 24:26.409
You guys aren't even
my real parents.

24:26.443 --> 24:28.411
- I can do whatever I want.
- You can knock that off.

24:28.445 --> 24:30.346
- And I want that thing
out of your nose.
- No.

24:30.381 --> 24:32.982
- Right now!
- Honey, look, I'm sorry.

24:33.017 --> 24:34.417
We should have told you
about the tour.

24:34.451 --> 24:36.352
That is not
the point, mom!

24:36.387 --> 24:40.223
Okay, well, I think
it's a good idea for you
to get to know her.

24:40.257 --> 24:43.393
And besides, we have to
find a way to integrate
daphne into our lives.

24:43.427 --> 24:47.297
- Why? Because
she's so perfect?
- No, of course not.

24:47.331 --> 24:49.299
You can't just
throw her in my face.

24:49.333 --> 24:51.434
Two seconds after meeting her
and she's going to my school?

24:51.468 --> 24:54.437
I know it's all
very fast, but--

24:54.471 --> 24:57.006
Bay, you have to be
reasonable here.

24:57.041 --> 24:59.008
She has not had the same
opportunities as you.

24:59.043 --> 25:01.978
And your mother
and I are just trying
to make this thing right.

25:02.012 --> 25:05.048
- Right for who?
- Right for all of us.

25:05.082 --> 25:07.984
Okay well,
what's right for me
is not having her here.

25:08.018 --> 25:11.254
And if you two
care about me at all,
you won't do this.

25:11.288 --> 25:13.122
Bay.

25:17.194 --> 25:19.095
Hey, what are you
doing here?

25:19.129 --> 25:21.097
Your dad set up
a tour for me.

25:21.131 --> 25:25.001
- Are you gonna go here?
- I don't know. We'll see.

25:31.108 --> 25:33.076
Emmett, this is toby.

25:33.110 --> 25:35.311
- Toby, this is emmett.
- Hey.

25:37.381 --> 25:39.282
He was just asking
who you are.

25:39.316 --> 25:42.185
- He doesn't talk?
- Not orally.

25:42.219 --> 25:44.354
Why not?

25:44.388 --> 25:48.024
I mean, why do
and others don't? Talk

25:48.058 --> 25:51.060
It just kind of depends
on the person--

25:51.095 --> 25:54.097
If they feel comfortable,
if they had speech therapy
growing up,

25:54.131 --> 25:55.365
If they want to speak.

25:55.399 --> 25:57.967
- But he reads lips?
- Yes.

25:58.002 --> 26:00.336
You can just
ask him directly.

26:00.371 --> 26:03.272
- But he won't answer.
- It just--

26:03.307 --> 26:05.108
It's not really
considered polite

26:05.142 --> 26:08.311
To talk about deaf people
in the third person.

26:08.345 --> 26:10.346
Plus, I can interpret.

26:10.381 --> 26:12.382
Well, what does he do
when you're not around?

26:14.985 --> 26:17.420
He actually isn't around people
who don't sign that often.

26:17.454 --> 26:22.058
All his friends are deaf
and his whole family is deaf.

26:22.092 --> 26:25.228
What about like stores,
restaurants, busses?

26:25.262 --> 26:28.264
- What does he do in,
like, real life?
- He gets by.

26:28.298 --> 26:32.001
Trust me, emmett gets by.

26:35.272 --> 26:37.440
Well, what did he say?

26:39.043 --> 26:41.210
He really likes your shoes.

26:44.415 --> 26:48.351
Cool.
Well, see you around.

26:50.254 --> 26:53.356
She's really mad at us.

27:00.264 --> 27:01.998
John.

- what are you, a tagger?</i>

28:05.229 --> 28:07.163
What-- what are you
doing here?

28:07.197 --> 28:08.931
I live right there.

28:08.966 --> 28:11.334
<i>The better question is
what are you doing here?</i>

28:11.368 --> 28:16.038
I'm not here.
You never saw me.

28:16.073 --> 28:18.207
Pretty sure the fine
for graffiti

28:18.242 --> 28:21.010
Is $10,000,
30 days in jail.

28:21.044 --> 28:24.380
- But hey, it's your party.
- Thanks for looking out
for me, really.

28:26.950 --> 28:28.918
You know,
I've seen these around.

28:28.952 --> 28:30.953
- This is really cool.
- Yeah?

28:30.988 --> 28:32.188
Well, just don't
tell anyone.

28:32.222 --> 28:36.392
<i>I actually do prefer
staying out of jail, okay?</i>

28:38.262 --> 28:40.229
Looks like I'm keeping
a lot of your secrets.

28:40.264 --> 28:44.400
Yeah, looks like it.

28:51.308 --> 28:55.178
I admit it,
I went crazy when I saw her
on that motorcycle.

28:55.212 --> 28:57.280
I thought,
"what kind of mother lets
her teenage daughter--"

28:57.314 --> 29:00.883
Kathryn, what did you do?

29:00.918 --> 29:03.186
I ran
a security check...

29:05.088 --> 29:08.090
To see who this woman
really is.

29:08.125 --> 29:12.962
- And?
- She has two d.U.I.S.

29:12.996 --> 29:15.231
I think we should
have bay over.

29:15.265 --> 29:17.900
We'll have dinner,
watch a movie.

29:17.935 --> 29:20.102
Please.
Ma, you should
see their house.

29:20.137 --> 29:23.172
- She does not
want to come here.
- Regina, you're her mother.

29:23.207 --> 29:25.942
She doesn't care
how big your house is.

29:28.278 --> 29:30.947
What--

29:30.981 --> 29:33.282
Damn it!

29:33.317 --> 29:36.185
They took
my cell phone charger
and $2 in change.

29:36.220 --> 29:38.287
You know what this is
gonna cost me

29:38.322 --> 29:40.923
For a cell phone charger
and $2 in change?

29:40.958 --> 29:43.159
<i>We have to move out of here.</i>

29:45.963 --> 29:49.232
Hello? What?

29:49.266 --> 29:52.001
No, there must be
some mistake.

29:53.937 --> 29:56.272
- Daphne's been arrested.
- What? What for?

29:56.306 --> 29:58.074
She needs an interpreter.

29:58.108 --> 30:00.176
By law you have to
get her an interpreter.

30:20.492 --> 30:24.128
- Were you trying
to get arrested?
- Everyone has one, mom.

30:24.162 --> 30:26.197
Oh, that chick
is such a weasel
for busting me.

30:26.231 --> 30:27.565
"Everyone has one"--
that's your excuse?

30:27.599 --> 30:30.401
First you get that thing
in your nose and now this?

30:30.435 --> 30:33.070
<i>It's micscopic.
Get over it.</i>

30:33.104 --> 30:36.173
You're gonna have it
for the rest of your life
and you didn't even ask me.

30:36.208 --> 30:38.242
What is the big deal?
It's her body.

30:38.276 --> 30:41.145
- Excuse me?
- She is right.
It's my body.

30:41.179 --> 30:44.415
Okay, we're done here.
Court date's on the 26th.

30:44.449 --> 30:47.218
Court date--
that should sound familiar.

30:47.252 --> 30:50.187
- What was that?
- We know about
your d.U.I.S.

30:50.222 --> 30:52.189
<i>- This is not
the time or place.
Why not?</i>

30:52.224 --> 30:54.358
That was 12 years ago.
How do you even know about--

30:54.392 --> 30:56.560
- Were you drunk
when daphne got sick?
- Kathryn, stop it, please.

30:56.595 --> 31:00.097
No, I wanna know.
Did you wait too long
to take her to the hospital?

31:00.131 --> 31:02.399
Is that why
her fever got so high?
Is that why she is deaf?

31:02.434 --> 31:04.501
Because being deaf
is the worst possible thing

31:04.536 --> 31:06.036
You could imagine
for your daughter, right?

31:06.071 --> 31:07.204
That is not what
she's trying to say.

31:07.239 --> 31:08.372
You don't know a thing
about her or me.

31:08.406 --> 31:10.174
We know that you're
not responsible.

31:10.208 --> 31:12.076
Will you all just stop
fighting, please?

31:12.110 --> 31:14.044
May I remind you that
we're in the police station

31:14.079 --> 31:15.179
Because of the daughter
that you raised?

31:15.213 --> 31:17.081
Do you even
hear yourselves?

31:17.115 --> 31:19.383
We intend to get an attorney
and take daphne back.

31:19.417 --> 31:21.452
- Don't even think about that.
- We will think about it.

31:21.486 --> 31:24.255
Bay, hold on one second.
Both of you just calm down.

31:24.289 --> 31:26.490
- No, I can't believe
you're taking her s--
- bay? Bay?

31:31.563 --> 31:34.098
I think we should keep
looking for her.

31:34.132 --> 31:36.300
Honey, she's got her phone.
She'll call a friend.

31:36.334 --> 31:38.535
<i>She'll be fine.</i>

31:38.570 --> 31:41.405
How could I
not have known?

31:41.439 --> 31:45.142
Because you had been
in labor for 17 hours.

31:45.176 --> 31:47.144
Because all newborns
look alike.

31:47.178 --> 31:49.146
Because someone
from that hospital

31:49.180 --> 31:51.081
Came to us and said,
"hey, here's your baby."

31:51.116 --> 31:52.483
And we had no reason
not to believe them.

31:52.517 --> 31:54.485
I keep asking myself
the same thing.

31:54.519 --> 31:56.553
But it's different for me.
I carried her.

31:56.588 --> 31:59.189
She was inside of me.
She was my baby.

31:59.224 --> 32:01.125
Okay, this is not helping.

32:02.260 --> 32:04.094
That woman got her.

32:04.129 --> 32:07.164
If we had figured this out
at the hospital,

32:07.198 --> 32:09.433
We would never
have gotten bay.

32:11.536 --> 32:13.437
I know.

32:13.471 --> 32:15.372
That's the crazy part.

32:15.407 --> 32:19.376
I can't even be angry
because I am so grateful.

32:22.280 --> 32:25.382
I know, it's--
I know.

32:27.485 --> 32:29.320
<i>It's a really good school.</i>

32:29.354 --> 32:32.323
It just-- it seems
so important to them.

32:32.357 --> 32:36.060
But mom would freak out
if I told her I wanted to go.

32:36.094 --> 32:40.130
But if I say no, it's like
I'm rejecting them.

32:40.165 --> 32:42.399
Ugh.

32:42.434 --> 32:44.234
Just tell me
what to do.

32:44.269 --> 32:47.271
Well, it's up to you.

32:47.305 --> 32:50.274
You find her?

32:51.476 --> 32:53.510
They think she's
at a friend's house

32:53.545 --> 32:56.380
And she'll call
when she's ready.

33:03.154 --> 33:05.422
Okay, I'm going to bed.

33:07.092 --> 33:08.459
Good night.

33:17.068 --> 33:19.269
I need to talk to you.

33:19.304 --> 33:24.341
I need you
to stop lashing out
at the kennishes.

33:24.376 --> 33:27.444
As uneducated as they are
about deaf culture,
they mean well.

33:27.479 --> 33:30.381
- Those people--
- let me finish.

33:30.415 --> 33:33.350
You are my mom.

33:35.153 --> 33:39.223
You will always be my mom.

33:39.257 --> 33:42.493
But I need to get
to know them too.

33:42.527 --> 33:47.297
I took a tour
of that hearing school
where bay goes.

33:47.332 --> 33:53.237
They really want
me to go and I think
I'm gonna say yes.

33:53.271 --> 33:58.075
So I need you to support
my decision, okay?

33:58.109 --> 34:00.444
Absolutely not.

34:00.478 --> 34:02.479
What?

34:02.514 --> 34:05.416
You want to be
that weird deaf girl

34:05.450 --> 34:08.485
With the interpreter
following her around?

34:08.520 --> 34:11.221
You know what happens
to deaf kids

34:11.255 --> 34:13.090
At hearing schools.

34:13.123 --> 34:16.159
They're outsiders.

34:16.194 --> 34:19.196
Daphne, you can do
anything you want
with your life.

34:19.230 --> 34:21.498
I have always
told you that.

34:21.533 --> 34:25.502
You're 1,000 times smarter
than any of those hearing kids

34:25.536 --> 34:28.405
Who used to tease you
and make you feel stupid.

34:28.440 --> 34:30.274
It's not gonna
be like that.

34:30.308 --> 34:32.074
I'm not five years old
anymore.

34:32.110 --> 34:34.110
I don't need you
to protect me.

34:34.145 --> 34:35.512
Yes, you do.

34:35.547 --> 34:38.382
Now I have to protect you
from yourself.

34:40.083 --> 34:42.386
You know what's right,

34:42.420 --> 34:46.089
But you're letting
these people pressure you

34:46.123 --> 34:49.493
Because you're so desperate
for their acceptance.

34:51.094 --> 34:56.266
Let them love you
for who you are,

34:56.301 --> 34:59.369
Not who they think
you should be.

35:52.473 --> 35:54.041
You could have
left it alone, but, no,

35:54.075 --> 35:56.743
You had to go dragging
mom and dad to that
genetic counselor.

35:56.778 --> 35:58.745
Well, excuse me for being
such a selfish person.

35:58.780 --> 36:00.747

start any of this either.

36:07.388 --> 36:10.123
I wasn't expecting
the answer to be yes.

36:10.158 --> 36:12.626
I know I said I did,
but deep down,

36:12.660 --> 36:15.462
I was hoping there'd be
some other explanation.

36:18.566 --> 36:20.901
Forget it. I know
you can't understand.

36:20.935 --> 36:23.103
No one can.

36:23.137 --> 36:24.104
You know what's funny?

36:24.138 --> 36:25.605
In school they're
always saying,

36:25.640 --> 36:27.407
"hey, kids, it's cool.
You know, don't worry

36:27.442 --> 36:29.276
If you feel like
you don't belong."

36:29.310 --> 36:30.377
But you,

36:30.411 --> 36:33.080
<i>You really don't belong.</i>

36:33.114 --> 36:34.247
At all.

36:36.350 --> 36:38.952
Thank you. So much.
That was incredibly helpful.

36:38.986 --> 36:44.091
And by the way, genius,
there is one other person
that would understand.

I like it that way too.

37:50.691 --> 37:52.325
Uh...

37:52.360 --> 37:53.994
Did you do these?

37:54.028 --> 37:56.263
God, no. I wish.

37:56.297 --> 37:58.165
My mom did them.

38:01.936 --> 38:04.971
I don't mean to interrupt
all this, but...

38:05.006 --> 38:07.007
What are you doing here?

38:07.041 --> 38:09.509
Oh, just... You know.

38:09.544 --> 38:11.077
Can I ask you something?

38:12.513 --> 38:14.281
Did you know?

38:14.315 --> 38:18.018
I mean, growing up,
did you ever feel...
Different?

38:18.052 --> 38:20.086
Well, yeah. I'm deaf.

38:20.121 --> 38:23.089
Mm.
And, frankly...

38:23.124 --> 38:26.326
I have been through
a hell of a lot
worse than this.

38:26.360 --> 38:30.831
Hey, uh, look,
if you want to go
to my school,

38:30.865 --> 38:31.865
It's fine.

38:31.899 --> 38:33.166
Okay.

38:33.201 --> 38:34.868
Thanks.

38:36.270 --> 38:38.505
So what happens now?

38:38.539 --> 38:41.274
I can't switch families
or anything like that.

38:41.309 --> 38:43.310
Plus, I'm sure you don't
want to move to toledo.

38:43.344 --> 38:44.878
Who's moving to toledo?

38:44.912 --> 38:48.315
We have an uncle there.
He said we could move in.

38:48.349 --> 38:50.717
My mom's two months
behind on rent.

38:50.751 --> 38:52.686
She keeps losing clients.

38:52.720 --> 38:56.623
I think we might actually
have to go this time.

38:56.657 --> 38:59.025
Yeah, dad, I know.
I'm sorry.

39:00.661 --> 39:02.495
I love you too.

39:02.530 --> 39:03.530
See you in the morning.

39:03.564 --> 39:06.800
Well, nobody invited me
to the party, but...

39:06.834 --> 39:08.969
grandma, this is bay.

39:09.003 --> 39:11.705
Bay, this is...
Your grandma, I guess.

39:11.739 --> 39:13.173
<i>Iay, qué linda!</i>

39:13.207 --> 39:15.976
Oh!

39:16.010 --> 39:17.677
You're gorgeous!

39:17.712 --> 39:20.013
I can't believe
I'm part puerto rican.

39:20.047 --> 39:22.682
I've been taking french
for nine years.

39:24.218 --> 39:26.686
You're here.
Thank god.

39:26.721 --> 39:28.355
But you are
in high school.

39:28.389 --> 39:30.257
What on earth are you
doing ordering beer

39:30.291 --> 39:31.758
Under any circumstances?

39:31.792 --> 39:33.960
You deserve
to get arrested.

39:33.995 --> 39:35.328
You got arrested?

39:35.363 --> 39:36.830
Eh, what can I say?

39:36.864 --> 39:38.798
No one tells me anything.

39:38.833 --> 39:40.834
And running away
by yourself?

39:40.868 --> 39:42.435
Do you know how
freaked out we were?

39:42.470 --> 39:43.603
Yes.

39:43.638 --> 39:46.606
<i>Ella es exactamente
como tÃº eras a su edad.</i>

39:46.641 --> 39:48.408
<i>Es por eso que
estoy preocupada.</i>

39:48.442 --> 39:51.211
Between the spanish
and the signing,
I'm lost.

39:51.245 --> 39:53.780
She said you are
just like I was

39:53.814 --> 39:56.182
At your age.

40:00.087 --> 40:02.522
Are you really
moving to toledo?

40:02.556 --> 40:05.258
I don't know.
We'll see.

40:06.360 --> 40:08.194
How are we gonna
get to know each other

40:08.229 --> 40:11.398
If you live
1,200 miles away?

40:11.432 --> 40:13.833
We'll just have
to make it work.

40:13.868 --> 40:17.404
<i>But we will
make it work.</i>

40:17.438 --> 40:20.106
You are stuck
with two mothers,

40:20.141 --> 40:22.575
Whether you like it
or not.

40:31.652 --> 40:34.487
Regina did it.
Oh.

40:34.522 --> 40:36.589
Well, it's very...

40:36.624 --> 40:39.092
Temporary. They're clips.

40:39.126 --> 40:40.794
Thank god.

40:40.828 --> 40:42.629
What happened to
that thing on your nose?

40:42.663 --> 40:45.732
Uh, it was a sticker.

40:47.335 --> 40:48.735
Honey, I love you.

40:48.769 --> 40:51.004
But you're still in trouble
for that fake I.D.

40:51.038 --> 40:52.238
I know!

40:54.575 --> 40:55.742
Mom?

40:55.776 --> 40:57.177
Mm-hm?

40:57.211 --> 40:59.512
You know that guest house
that we hardly ever use?

41:01.782 --> 41:03.817
All this space.

41:03.851 --> 41:05.352
My boyfriend will finally
have somewhere

41:05.386 --> 41:07.120
To rehearse his garage band.

41:07.154 --> 41:09.255
Ha. We said no rules.

41:09.290 --> 41:11.992
She doesn't even
have a boyfriend.

41:14.328 --> 41:16.162
Hi!

41:16.197 --> 41:17.864
It's fantastic up here.

41:17.898 --> 41:19.666
Who is that?

41:19.700 --> 41:21.634
Absolutely lovely.
I am so excited.

41:21.669 --> 41:23.636
No, really.

41:23.671 --> 41:25.739
Who is that?

41:26.707 --> 41:29.476
Excuse me...!

41:32.179 --> 41:33.646
What are you doing here?

41:33.681 --> 41:35.582
Not a rich white girl, huh?

41:35.616 --> 41:37.951
It's a long story.

41:36.585 --> 41:40.421
By the way,
that dude magritte,
he's pretty trippy.

41:40.456 --> 41:42.156
What's with all
the faceless guys?

41:42.191 --> 41:45.360
The hat. Apple.
What's that all about?

41:45.394 --> 41:47.795
You looked it up.

41:47.830 --> 41:51.065
Listen, hot girls quote
french to me all the time
in back alleys.

41:51.100 --> 41:53.301
Oh.

41:53.335 --> 41:55.103
Did you guys meet?
Bay, this is ty.

41:55.137 --> 41:56.604
He'sike my big brother.

41:56.639 --> 41:58.306
Not by blood, right?

41:58.340 --> 41:59.340
No.

41:59.375 --> 42:01.509
Okay. Good. Cool.

42:01.543 --> 42:03.845
Nice to meet you, bay.

42:03.879 --> 42:05.980
See you around, ty.

42:10.386 --> 42:11.786
What?

42:12.755 --> 42:14.022
Regina, um...

42:14.056 --> 42:16.290
Anything in the house
is yours.

42:16.325 --> 42:18.693
The pantry
and the refrigerator,
and we have a full bar...

42:18.727 --> 42:20.595
I'm sober, kathryn.

42:20.629 --> 42:23.197
I've been sober
for 11 1/2 years.

42:23.232 --> 42:25.199
Oh. I-I didn't know.

42:25.234 --> 42:26.634
Of course you didn't.

42:26.669 --> 42:28.302
We don't know anything
about each other,

42:28.337 --> 42:30.071
Except that we raised
each other's daughters.

42:30.105 --> 42:33.341
Yeah, but I-I
was just saying--
look.

42:33.375 --> 42:35.510
We agreed
to this arrangement so
I could get to know bay

42:35.544 --> 42:37.512
And you could
get to know daphne.

42:37.546 --> 42:39.447
And, frankly,
I could use the free rent.

42:39.448 --> 42:42.113

42:42.114 --> 42:46.589
