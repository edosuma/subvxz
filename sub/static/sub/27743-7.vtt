Esteemed fellow VILE Faculty,
as you know, I, Gunnar Maelstrom,

01:06.316 --> 01:12.030
have been called demented,
deranged, psychotic, even.

01:12.363 --> 01:14.616
Justifiably? Perhaps.

01:15.033 --> 01:17.327
But I feel these are merely labels,

01:17.660 --> 01:21.498
safe ways to categorize
my unique intellect,

01:21.873 --> 01:26.127
which enables me to see opportunity
where others do not.

01:26.711 --> 01:30.381
So allow me
to draw your attention to this,

01:30.465 --> 01:36.095
the very foundation of law and order
in the Western world.

01:36.346 --> 01:40.308
Looks more like a lion cub
sniffing its own tail if you ask me.

01:41.643 --> 01:44.187
Wrong slide. This.

01:44.813 --> 01:47.148
The Magna Carta!

01:47.524 --> 01:50.443
-You're saying words I don't understand.
-Ugh!

01:50.527 --> 01:55.949
Coach Brunt, I suspect you are familiar
with the US Constitution?

01:56.282 --> 01:58.451
Darn right. I'm Texas proud.

01:58.535 --> 02:02.080
Think of the Magna Carta
as the British version of it,

02:02.163 --> 02:04.791
written more than 500 years earlier.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.127
And for the first time in history,

02:07.210 --> 02:11.172
every known original copy
of this historic document,

02:11.256 --> 02:15.510
all 17 of them,
will be on display under one roof.

02:16.177 --> 02:20.056
Here, at this renowned museum
in Mumbai, India.

02:20.849 --> 02:23.977
Which means we have
an opportunity to steal it

02:24.435 --> 02:27.480
in the name of law and disorder.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.858
Would I be correct in assuming

02:29.941 --> 02:34.737
that you have a particular operative
in mind for this misdeed, Professor?

02:35.029 --> 02:38.783
The crime involves stealing paper,
does it not?

02:38.992 --> 02:40.660
She is far from ready.

02:40.910 --> 02:42.370

02:42.453 --> 02:46.374
after my compelling intro,
dear Shadowsan?

02:46.624 --> 02:49.919
Carmen Sandiego
was unruly and undisciplined

02:50.003 --> 02:51.588

02:51.671 --> 02:55.174

I know how Professor Maelstrom's
twisted mind works,

and he'd never pass up
an opportunity like this.

03:21.534 --> 03:24.078
[Carmen]<i> Stealing the Magna Carta</i>

03:24.162 --> 03:27.332

03:29.709 --> 03:31.544

03:31.961 --> 03:35.673

03:40.511 --> 03:42.764
<i>King John figured he could take</i>
<i>anything he wanted</i>

03:42.847 --> 03:46.809
<i>just because he was in charge,</i>
<i>and he abused that power constantly.</i>

03:46.893 --> 03:48.645
<i>The Archbishop of Canterbury stepped in</i>

03:48.728 --> 03:51.356

<i>Basic stuff like you can't be arrested</i>
<i>for no reason</i>

03:54.651 --> 03:57.904
<i>or have your horse taken away from you</i>
<i>just because the king wants it.</i>

03:57.987 --> 04:00.365
[Carmen]<i> These combined laws</i>
<i>were named the Magna Carta,</i>

04:00.448 --> 04:02.909
<i>Latin for "the Great Charter</i>

04:02.992 --> 04:05.203

their mangy claws

11:50.167 --> 11:52.586
Standard procedure

This way, no one operative
knows too much about any given job.

If they get nabbed,
they can only divulge so much information.

15:41.899 --> 15:43.525
while keeping her in mine.

15:44.735 --> 15:47.446
Ms. Sandiego, I presume.

15:48.155 --> 15:48.989
Ugh.

15:49.365 --> 15:53.535
I almost did not recognize you
without your evening wear.

15:53.994 --> 15:57.122
Aren't you a bit out of your jurisdiction,
Inspector Devineaux?

15:57.414 --> 16:00.501
I recently acquired greater authority.

16:00.834 --> 16:02.670
That's awfully vague, Inspector.

16:03.003 --> 16:05.047
Is it even "Inspector" anymore?

16:05.130 --> 16:06.131
Enough chitchat!

16:06.507 --> 16:08.467
Where are you hiding the Magna Cartas?

16:08.550 --> 16:12.054
Me? Nowhere.
But they are closer than you think.

16:12.137 --> 16:13.806
[phone beeping]

16:16.392 --> 16:17.810
You will take me to them.

16:18.852 --> 16:20.813
Or what? You'll cuff me?

16:22.106 --> 16:23.649
Why, yes.

16:24.066 --> 16:27.444
I lost you on a train once before.
Never again.

16:27.528 --> 16:29.780
[cuffs clicking]

16:30.531 --> 16:31.865
[stutters] What?

16:32.908 --> 16:35.577
No. No, no, no!

16:37.246 --> 16:38.205
ACME, huh?

16:50.384 --> 16:51.343
This seat taken?

16:51.593 --> 16:52.636
Actually, yes.

16:53.053 --> 16:56.807
But feel free to use it
until my partner returns.

16:57.182 --> 16:58.058
Partner?

17:01.186 --> 17:03.689
[clears throat] Travel partner.

17:04.356 --> 17:07.818
-I see. And you are?
-Julia.

17:08.193 --> 17:09.486
So, Jules...

17:10.237 --> 17:11.655
off to see the Taj Mahal?

17:12.031 --> 17:15.909
Oh, I wish.
The architecture, the history.

17:16.285 --> 17:18.037
Sadly, I'm traveling on business.

17:18.454 --> 17:19.580
Don't like your job, huh?

17:19.788 --> 17:21.999
No, no. I love my job.

17:22.082 --> 17:24.585
I just love history even more, I suppose.

17:25.002 --> 17:27.171
Then you must really be upset
about the Magna Carta.

17:27.463 --> 17:28.297
What?

17:28.422 --> 17:30.799
The theft, it's in all the news.

17:32.634 --> 17:34.595
Wonderful chatting with you, Jules!

17:35.637 --> 17:37.347
But I never did get your name.

17:38.849 --> 17:39.683
[gasps]

17:44.063 --> 17:45.814
Come on, come on.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.941
Agent Devineaux, I found Carmen San--

17:48.025 --> 17:50.486
[Chase]<i> You've reached</i>
<i>Inspector Chase Devineaux.</i>

17:50.569 --> 17:52.154
<i>-Please leave a message.</i>
-[beeps]

17:52.237 --> 17:53.113
Oh, dear.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.699
[train horn blows]

18:17.262 --> 18:18.263
[Paper Star grunts] Hey!

18:20.015 --> 18:23.268
[both grunting]

18:24.937 --> 18:25.771
[groans]

18:31.527 --> 18:33.487
[toilet flushes]

18:33.987 --> 18:35.614
Stinks running out of paper.

18:36.073 --> 18:38.742
Now, can we try chatting
without killing any trees?

18:44.456 --> 18:45.499
You should run.

18:48.710 --> 18:50.921
[both grunting]

18:57.511 --> 18:59.179
[both grunting]

19:10.274 --> 19:11.650
Care to run now?

19:14.611 --> 19:15.779
[growls]

19:31.295 --> 19:34.464
Nowhere to hide. Not very smart.

19:38.635 --> 19:39.595
Oh, really?

19:40.053 --> 19:41.555
Wind beats paper.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.015
Rah!

19:45.184 --> 19:48.270
[both grunting]

19:58.197 --> 19:59.031
[gasps]

20:00.908 --> 20:02.367
[both grunting]

20:04.745 --> 20:05.579
[Paper Star shouts]

20:10.125 --> 20:12.169
Whoa! [grunts]

20:30.896 --> 20:32.231
[grunting]

20:32.940 --> 20:33.982
Here goes nothing.

20:34.524 --> 20:35.359
[grunts]

20:41.198 --> 20:42.199
[grunts]

20:51.708 --> 20:53.585
[crow cawing]

20:56.171 --> 20:57.589
[Devineaux groaning]

20:58.298 --> 21:00.592
-Agent Devineaux? How did you--?
-[grunts]

21:00.676 --> 21:03.428
Never mind that!
The keys are in my briefcase!

21:04.471 --> 21:05.847
[train horn honks]

21:15.399 --> 21:16.233
[gasps]

21:17.401 --> 21:20.362
<i>-</i>[Player] <i>So, you have the docs?</i>
-They're in good hands.

21:21.071 --> 21:23.532
Though it seems
our friend Inspector Chase Devineaux

21:23.615 --> 21:26.118
may be running with a slicker outfit
these days.

21:26.201 --> 21:28.495
Picked his pocket.
Think you can hack a keycard?

21:28.578 --> 21:30.330
<i>Worth a try. Send it over.</i>

21:33.417 --> 21:34.334
[gasps]

21:42.676 --> 21:45.762
[Shadowsan] Did you not assure us
that Paper Star was ready?

21:45.971 --> 21:48.807
I never instructed her to break protocol.

21:49.141 --> 21:52.102
[Paper Star humming]

21:58.859 --> 22:01.028
Faculty only, sassy-pants.

22:01.236 --> 22:02.738
But my ears were burning.

22:03.405 --> 22:06.241
You failed to complete your mission.

22:07.284 --> 22:08.744
[Paper Star] Guilty as charged.

22:09.202 --> 22:12.039
But I never come to a party empty-handed.

22:22.466 --> 22:24.676
[theme music playing]
