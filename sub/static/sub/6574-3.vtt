19:44.306 --> 19:49.119
will know we come in peace.
And know we expect a fair trial.

19:49.344 --> 19:50.550
How long will you be gone?

19:50.712 --> 19:53.056
However long it takes
to clear our names, Kon-El.

19:53.215 --> 19:55.456
But we will be back, little brother.

19:56.218 --> 19:59.222
- I'll miss you.
- And I, you, M'gann.

19:59.388 --> 20:03.803
Oh. Perhaps you could water the plants
in my apartment while I am gone.

20:03.959 --> 20:05.461
Be careful, all right?

20:05.627 --> 20:08.506
Was about to say the same to you three.

20:08.664 --> 20:11.907
I fear we leave
the more dangerous task here on Earth.

20:13.368 --> 20:16.178
- We'll manage.
GREEN LANTERN: Time to go.

20:20.809 --> 20:22.584
May the gods be with you all.
