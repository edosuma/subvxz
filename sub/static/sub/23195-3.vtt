00:36.915 --> 00:38.582
How are you lost? You're the RA!

00:38.582 --> 00:40.040
Hey, you're the one who overslept.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.375
Well, I'm sorry, I had to practice with my new game deck

00:42.375 --> 00:44.540
if I want to get good and impress Jenny Matrix.

00:44.540 --> 00:46.000
Hey, Brian.

00:46.082 --> 00:48.290
Loved watching you kill Annihilist last night -

00:48.290 --> 00:49.875
Very impressive.

00:50.165 --> 00:52.165
How would you like a spot on JV?

00:52.957 --> 00:54.457
Are you serious?

00:54.457 --> 00:56.457
Double-stuf serious.

00:56.500 --> 00:59.040
JV could use a boost in the cute department.

00:59.332 --> 01:00.832
Welcome to the team...

01:00.832 --> 01:01.915
...and welcome

01:01.915 --> 01:03.375
TO ME!

01:12.500 --> 01:14.415
Is anyone else hearing this?

01:16.500 --> 01:18.000
Nope.

01:23.207 --> 01:24.375
Cheeto...?

01:24.375 --> 01:25.875
Killing spree

01:30.375 --> 01:31.790
Mornin' roomie!

01:34.750 --> 01:36.165
Pizza brunch?

01:43.625 --> 01:45.832
What is with everyone today?

01:45.832 --> 01:46.500
Well...

01:46.500 --> 01:48.250
You killed the number one player at the school...

01:48.250 --> 01:50.625
...you got a guy kicked out on your first day...

01:50.625 --> 01:52.582
You're a marked man, Brian.

01:52.790 --> 01:54.332
Just like this pizza!

01:54.332 --> 01:56.000
Everyone wants a piece of you!

01:56.000 --> 01:57.500
I gotta keep my head down...

01:57.500 --> 01:59.457
You're right - we could throw you a party.

01:59.665 --> 02:00.957
What? - In your honor.

02:00.957 --> 02:01.582
I didn't say that...

02:01.582 --> 02:02.290
Called Brianpalooza.

02:02.290 --> 02:02.665
No!

02:02.665 --> 02:03.665
Hi! Brian!

02:03.665 --> 02:05.790
I had a question about Brianpalooza.

02:05.957 --> 02:07.707
Did you take this while I was sleeping?

02:07.707 --> 02:10.164
I have a very aggressive street team.

02:10.582 --> 02:13.457
I was just wondering what time "Rock o'clock" is?

02:13.625 --> 02:15.500
You know - half past rad.

02:15.500 --> 02:16.707
But when is half past rad?

02:16.707 --> 02:19.165
Quarter to score. - Ted, no. Seriously, like...

02:19.165 --> 02:21.125
Every twitcher in the school wants to fight me.

02:21.125 --> 02:23.207
I'm not gonna throw them a party.

02:23.207 --> 02:25.207
Can we please just...

02:29.457 --> 02:32.457
...hang out by this stairwell?

02:32.457 --> 02:35.375
Look at this view! This could be our new hangout spot, am I right?

02:35.375 --> 02:36.250
Wow!

02:36.250 --> 02:38.207
I can't believe I hadn't thought of it.

02:38.207 --> 02:40.082
I'll add it to my list that I made

02:40.082 --> 02:41.540
of potential hangout spots.

02:41.540 --> 02:42.750
Really?

02:42.750 --> 02:46.082
Okay. A party's one thing, but you can't even walk past The Law?

02:46.082 --> 02:47.875
Come on it's time to stop hiding in the shadows

02:47.875 --> 02:50.125
and shine like the star that you are!

02:53.040 --> 02:55.290
I'll stick to the shadows, thanks.

02:58.832 --> 03:00.707
I'll see you in class.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.457
What's gaming all about, Brian?

03:04.457 --> 03:06.375
Well, um...

03:06.375 --> 03:08.207
I always thought that... - I'm sure if I looked at

03:08.207 --> 03:10.207
Brian's Big Book of Gaming

03:10.207 --> 03:12.000
It'd tell me that gaming's all about

03:12.000 --> 03:13.790
expelling classmates

03:13.790 --> 03:15.125
Starting fights

03:15.125 --> 03:18.082
Landing the cover of The Wall Street Journal.

03:18.540 --> 03:21.415
You know what gaming's really about, Brian?

03:22.457 --> 03:23.832
Boom.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.082
It's all about the game.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.500
Gaming's... all about the game, sir?

03:29.500 --> 03:32.625
I knew you wouldn't understand.

03:33.540 --> 03:35.250
You're in the danger zone, kid.

03:35.250 --> 03:37.665
You may have snapped a few points wasting Annihilist, but...

03:37.665 --> 03:40.040
If you want to last more than a week at this school...

03:40.040 --> 03:42.457
I suggest you start keeping a low profile.

03:42.457 --> 03:43.750
I-I hear you, sir.

03:43.750 --> 03:45.165
I was actually just telling my friends:

03:45.165 --> 03:47.250
"Low profile" - that's my game.

03:47.415 --> 03:48.750
Really.

03:53.165 --> 03:57.707
Does that game include a minigame about being fulll of crap!?

03:57.957 --> 04:00.415
Now get out of my office.

04:00.415 --> 04:01.207
Okay.

04:01.207 --> 04:02.415
Hello students

04:02.415 --> 04:06.290
and welcome to FPS 101.

04:06.290 --> 04:08.875
My name is Ace. You can call me Ace.

04:08.875 --> 04:10.332
Sound good? Fantastic.

04:10.332 --> 04:11.832
Now I'm sure a lot of you are thinking right now:

04:11.832 --> 04:16.457
"Hey. I got myself into VGHS. What's with all the back to basics baloney?"

04:16.458 --> 04:17.500
Well.

04:17.500 --> 04:21.125
Let me just set the record straight for you pardners real quick like...

04:21.125 --> 04:24.750
You don't know shinola about first person shootin'

04:24.750 --> 04:27.040
Freshman year is about two things, hear me now...

04:27.040 --> 04:28.540
Fundamentals...

04:28.540 --> 04:32.332
and first impressions. Brian D, I presume?

04:32.333 --> 04:33.833
Sorry I was late, sir.

04:33.833 --> 04:36.041
Well you've already broken Ace's first rule.

04:36.040 --> 04:36.875
Be punctual.

04:36.875 --> 04:38.625
No. Rule #1 is "Know Ace's Rules."

04:38.625 --> 04:41.375
You'd have known that had you been punctual. Have a seat.

04:41.375 --> 04:43.040
Brian! - Sorry I'm late, Mr. Ace.

04:43.040 --> 04:45.582
Call me Ace, alright? Mr. Ace was my father's name

04:45.583 --> 04:47.541
Rule #1, Brian!

04:55.665 --> 04:57.707
Now, back to first impressions... - Dude.

04:57.708 --> 04:59.916
-The first girl y'all ought to be impressin' - Check out who our TA is...

04:59.915 --> 05:02.625
is our straight shootin' TA over here Jenny Matrix.

05:02.625 --> 05:03.790
That's right, Ace.

05:03.790 --> 05:06.500
As JV captain I have to choose an honorary freshman

05:06.500 --> 05:08.665
to play in our scrimmage against Varsity tomorrow.

05:08.750 --> 05:11.708
Personally, I think it's a huge waste of time but...

05:11.708 --> 05:13.500
It's tradition.

05:13.500 --> 05:16.083
Brian! That could be you wasting her time tomorrow!

05:16.083 --> 05:17.041
I don't know, Ki, I...

05:17.040 --> 05:20.207
The scrim is a perfect opportunity to be rubbin' elbows

05:20.208 --> 05:23.791
with some of the best mouse jockies this high school has to offer.

05:23.790 --> 05:27.082
Jenny you think any of these cheesedusters has what it takes?

05:27.083 --> 05:29.416
Well there's only one way to find out, Ace...

05:29.415 --> 05:31.290
Let's hit The Pit.

05:31.625 --> 05:33.290
I cannot wait.

05:33.290 --> 05:36.582
People underestimate The Pit because your targets are made of paper.

05:39.458 --> 05:42.625
But trust me. When you know The Pit...

05:42.625 --> 05:44.708
You know yourself.

05:45.833 --> 05:47.875
Playing games by yourself?

05:47.875 --> 05:50.625
I got better things to do in my sleep!

05:51.165 --> 05:53.750
This is great! I can totally do this level in my sleep!

05:53.750 --> 05:54.833
Yeah, great.

05:54.833 --> 05:56.083
So, Ki...

05:56.083 --> 05:58.000
Back to our favorite romance languages...

05:58.000 --> 05:59.583
What were yours again?

05:59.583 --> 06:01.625
Spanish? Italian?

06:02.625 --> 06:04.375
C++.

06:04.375 --> 06:06.415
"Very good."

06:08.583 --> 06:10.625
Be fast.

06:11.165 --> 06:12.082
Be efficient.

06:12.083 --> 06:13.666
And above all else...

06:17.290 --> 06:19.332
Be resourceful.

06:20.708 --> 06:21.833
Thirty-nine seconds...

06:21.833 --> 06:23.625
That's not bad, Matrix.

06:23.625 --> 06:25.583
Just shy of the school record.

06:25.583 --> 06:27.916
Wait, that's not right. You can get like ten seconds faster than that...

06:27.915 --> 06:30.125
Brian D! Something to share?

06:30.125 --> 06:32.750
No, sir. Ah... sorry. Uh...

06:32.750 --> 06:33.415
Wasn't important.

06:33.415 --> 06:35.040
Good. Then shut up.

06:35.665 --> 06:38.707
Brian was just saying he can complete the course much faster than you, Jenny.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.040
Well, la-dee-freakin-da. I'd love to see that.

06:42.583 --> 06:44.333
What about you, class?

06:46.583 --> 06:48.916
Honorary freshman, honorary freshman...

06:48.915 --> 06:50.125
C'mon Brian.

06:50.125 --> 06:51.500
Show us what you got.

06:51.500 --> 06:53.875
Try not to wet yourself, noob.

07:25.333 --> 07:27.708
That's somewhat... unorthodox.

07:59.540 --> 08:01.915
Brian... I am disappoint.

08:04.333 --> 08:05.416
Cheer up, Brian!

08:05.415 --> 08:08.125
At least no one wants to fight you anymore! - I figured it out!

08:08.125 --> 08:10.500
Rock o'clock is 3:32!

08:12.875 --> 08:14.250
We've missed Brianpalooza.

08:14.250 --> 08:15.665
Calhoun wants me dead...

08:15.665 --> 08:17.290
I'm late for Ace's class...

08:17.290 --> 08:18.957
Oh! And I can forget about playing in that scrimmage

08:18.958 --> 08:22.000
because Jenny probably thinks I'm the biggest dork in the universe!

08:22.875 --> 08:24.458
So! Jenny's here!

08:24.458 --> 08:25.833
What up, Matrix?

08:25.833 --> 08:26.833
What, uh...

08:26.833 --> 08:29.000
Brings you to our neck of the cafeteria...

08:29.000 --> 08:30.290
...woods?

08:30.790 --> 08:33.039
Well, I was going to invite you to my party

08:33.041 --> 08:37.916
because that was one of the sickest pit runs I've ever seen... but um...

08:37.916 --> 08:39.541
I'm sorry, could you just...?

08:39.750 --> 08:42.500
Oh! Sunglasses indoors...

08:42.500 --> 08:44.707
I must look like a douchebag, what was I thinking?

08:44.707 --> 08:46.500
We'll clean this up, we'll definitely be there!

08:46.500 --> 08:49.582
I hope this party is more organized than Brianpalooza.

08:50.332 --> 08:53.082
Sure. You guys can totally invite yourselves.

08:53.082 --> 08:55.250
Okay. My place. Tomorrow night.

08:55.250 --> 08:56.875
Sounds groovy, Jenny!

08:56.875 --> 08:58.832
Or should I say... Gravy - Brian. She's gone.

08:58.832 --> 09:00.540
Party... this could be like...

09:00.541 --> 09:02.041
Our first date!

09:02.332 --> 09:04.040
First... date...?

09:04.957 --> 09:07.375
Awesome! - Three-way fist pound?

09:07.541 --> 09:09.041
Brian. This way�
