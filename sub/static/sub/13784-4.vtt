01:45.167 --> 01:46.919
Let me light the lamp.

01:47.007 --> 01:48.963
I've misplaced my boots.

01:49.927 --> 01:52.725
I put them downstairs
by the kitchen door.

01:54.087 --> 01:55.645
I was asleep...

01:56.927 --> 01:59.236
when you took them and did that.

02:01.167 --> 02:04.603
- Yes. Would you rather I not?
- No.

02:06.527 --> 02:07.516
No.

02:08.007 --> 02:11.636
Only I had intended to be awake
last night so we could talk...

02:11.727 --> 02:16.323
which, what with how it's been,
we have not done...

02:17.487 --> 02:21.162
in the peace of the evening
as I would like, since your arrival.

02:21.247 --> 02:25.479
I would enjoy to converse
in the stillness, after the day, like that.

02:25.847 --> 02:29.999
Tonight, I will have two cups of coffee,
and I will not fall asleep.

02:31.727 --> 02:33.365
In the morning...

02:34.207 --> 02:37.199
in the quiet
before we each take up our work...

02:37.287 --> 02:40.438
is also a pleasant occasion
for such intercourse.

02:47.607 --> 02:48.676
Yes.

02:50.487 --> 02:53.684
Would you like to start a discussion
this morning?

02:57.447 --> 03:01.440
I wouldn't want to disturb the boy.

03:04.407 --> 03:06.318
William sleeps soundly.

03:08.087 --> 03:11.921
If you will see to the bedroom door,
Mr Bullock?

03:32.047 --> 03:33.719
Have I killed him?

03:33.887 --> 03:36.117
First, the dead don't shiver.

03:37.247 --> 03:40.045
And next, you just done what he asked.

03:41.287 --> 03:42.606
And ain't it more likely...

03:42.687 --> 03:44.598
what turned him worse
is underlying woe...

03:44.687 --> 03:48.043
than a thumb up his ass
attempting his fucking relief?

03:48.367 --> 03:50.642
Go on, get the fuck out of here.

04:20.807 --> 04:21.922
Hello.

04:22.927 --> 04:24.440
What's your business?

04:24.887 --> 04:26.639
I'm Francis Wolcott.

04:27.047 --> 04:29.766
My name's Ellsworth,
Mr Francis Wolcott.

04:29.967 --> 04:32.356
- Can you hear me?
- Yes, sir. How do you do?

04:32.447 --> 04:35.519
- I'm well. Glad you make me out.
- Yes, sir.

04:35.607 --> 04:36.960
Because them as poke around...

04:37.047 --> 04:39.163
Ms Garret's workings
without a by-your-leave...

04:39.247 --> 04:40.885
ain't welcome, Mr Wolcott...

04:40.967 --> 04:44.164
and you ought not to repeat
your fucking mistake.

04:45.007 --> 04:48.477
Well, that's an uncivil response
to an innocent error.

04:48.567 --> 04:51.035
Did you work in the Comstock
when you was beardless?

04:51.127 --> 04:52.242
I did.

04:52.327 --> 04:55.763
For Mr George Hearst,
has a keen eye for the colour?

04:55.847 --> 04:58.042
As a geologist for Mr Hearst.

04:58.967 --> 05:01.083
Well, you have the advantage of me,
Mr Ellsworth.

05:01.167 --> 05:03.476
That ain't a possibility, Wolcott.

05:03.567 --> 05:06.718
No more than an error of yours
would be innocent.

05:06.887 --> 05:09.560
I do dimly recall an Ellsworth.

05:09.967 --> 05:12.561
Superintended the consolidated
Virginia operations.

05:12.647 --> 05:14.922
I don't give a fuck what you recall.

05:15.007 --> 05:17.237
A hero. Dug a week without respite...

05:17.327 --> 05:19.318
to save three poor souls
from the cave-in.

05:19.407 --> 05:23.366
And 46 corpses in a fucking hole
that ought never to have been dug.

05:23.447 --> 05:26.405
Always a choice,
to count the saved or lost.

05:26.967 --> 05:28.798
Get off this property!

05:29.287 --> 05:32.643
Just as a man
opposed to inevitable change...

05:33.367 --> 05:35.756
needn't invariably be called a Luddite.

05:35.847 --> 05:38.486
Another choice might be
simply to describe him...

05:38.567 --> 05:40.239
as slow in his processes.

05:40.327 --> 05:43.956
You tell that cocksucker you work for,
the next surrogate he sends...

05:44.047 --> 05:46.880
oughtn't to be bloodied
from the Comstock.

05:50.407 --> 05:53.399
The noise is terrible,
isn't it, Mr Ellsworth?

05:54.367 --> 05:55.766
Like fate.

06:02.447 --> 06:04.278
"Ox, box, fox. "

06:07.567 --> 06:09.922
Nora's attentions are wandering.

06:10.047 --> 06:12.845
If I were you, I'd bribe her with candy.

06:23.047 --> 06:24.241
Good morning.

06:24.327 --> 06:26.761
Please come in, Miss Isringhausen.

06:30.487 --> 06:32.284
Will you have a seat?

06:36.047 --> 06:39.562
Do you remain of a mind, ma'am,
to dispense with my services?

06:39.647 --> 06:43.720
I have immense respect for your training
and intelligence, Miss Isringhausen...

06:43.807 --> 06:47.402
and gratitude for your efforts
toward Sofia's education.

06:47.887 --> 06:51.084
I am ill-suited temperamentally
to collaborate with you...

06:51.167 --> 06:53.601
as women in our positions must do.

06:53.687 --> 06:54.881
I see.

06:55.367 --> 06:58.120
I propose to pay you
six months' wages severance...

06:58.207 --> 07:00.562
and an additional $200 against...

07:00.647 --> 07:03.400
the expense for your journey here
and return to Chicago.

07:03.487 --> 07:04.966
While you're making
your arrangements...

07:05.047 --> 07:08.801
I will also continue to pay
for your room here at the hotel.

07:09.047 --> 07:12.722
As to those terms, Mrs Garret,
your behaviour is very fair.

07:13.847 --> 07:17.123
Miss Isringhausen,
Cotton Mather would have found...

07:17.327 --> 07:18.919
hard and joyless...

07:19.007 --> 07:22.079
the standards you so resolutely apply
to me and Sofia...

07:22.167 --> 07:24.317
and, of course, to yourself.

07:28.767 --> 07:30.564
I wish you very well.

07:31.247 --> 07:32.919
Thank you, madam.

07:33.007 --> 07:34.918
- Would you-
- I'll not say goodbye to Sofia...

07:35.007 --> 07:36.725
to spare her upset.

07:48.127 --> 07:50.243
- Dan.
- E.B.

07:51.167 --> 07:52.839
- Coffee?
- Please.

07:58.127 --> 07:59.765
I'll be candid, Dan.

07:59.847 --> 08:01.997
I did not sleep well last night.

08:02.087 --> 08:04.476
I heard screaming from Al's room.

08:04.567 --> 08:06.637
Happens up there
many a fucking evening.

08:06.727 --> 08:08.604
Well, Al was fucking screaming, Dan.

08:08.687 --> 08:10.917
And I'm wondering
how he's feeling this morning.

08:11.007 --> 08:15.080
And you dancing around the pole
ain't allaying my fucking anxieties.

08:15.167 --> 08:17.442
Well, do you hear any screams
from him now?

08:17.527 --> 08:19.324
Silence ain't proof either way.

08:19.407 --> 08:23.241
Take no tongue with me, E.B.,
or I'll slap you fucking silly!

08:27.567 --> 08:30.604
He's on the mend
and he ain't fucking receiving.

08:30.687 --> 08:32.405
Well, that's all I was fucking asking.

08:32.486 --> 08:35.638
- Then that's your fucking answer.
- Convey my joy.

08:36.607 --> 08:39.485
And tell him numerous scores await.

08:54.007 --> 08:55.599
Soft-fucking day, Dan.

08:55.687 --> 08:57.200
Morning, Crop Ear.

08:57.927 --> 08:59.280
Sorry, Eamon.

08:59.367 --> 09:02.006
Take a good look. Ain't growing back.

09:03.727 --> 09:06.639
- Is he about?
- Al's out early.

09:07.167 --> 09:09.317
Look at a place in Gayville.

09:10.487 --> 09:11.761
Oh, yeah?

09:13.087 --> 09:15.920
You must seize fortune
by the forelock, Dan.

09:16.007 --> 09:18.237
That's why I'm here,
to put a matter before him.

09:18.327 --> 09:21.160
- You know I'll not waste the man's time.
- No, you won't.

09:21.247 --> 09:23.477
That's some fucking way
you have about you, Dan.

09:23.567 --> 09:25.797
Now, you could either say your piece
to me and Johnny...

09:25.887 --> 09:27.957
or you can get the fuck out of here.

09:28.047 --> 09:29.275
I'll say it gladly...

09:29.367 --> 09:31.198
and hope you'll commend my words
to him...

09:31.287 --> 09:34.359
who's in Gayville,
at the earliest opportunity.

09:34.567 --> 09:36.398
I contemplate a piece of activity.

09:36.487 --> 09:38.557
I need to organise
some reliable fellows...

09:38.647 --> 09:41.115
locate a right place to waylay that metal.

09:41.207 --> 09:42.481
I'll let him know.

09:42.567 --> 09:43.716
Twenty-five percent.

09:43.807 --> 09:48.517
One full quarter of the proceeds in total
go to Al Swearengen...

09:48.927 --> 09:50.679
the Gem Saloon...

09:50.767 --> 09:53.679
or you and Johnny,
as the fucking case may be.

09:53.767 --> 09:55.758
You may need to clean the wax
out of your holes...

09:55.847 --> 09:57.758
because I said I will let him know.

09:57.847 --> 10:01.476
When do you suppose I could expect
a favour of a response?

10:01.847 --> 10:03.565
Tomorrow afternoon.

10:04.447 --> 10:06.756
He's overnight in Gayville then?

10:07.847 --> 10:10.122
Then tomorrow afternoon it is.

10:14.207 --> 10:17.677
Getting particular
of where he was gone, I realise now...

10:18.127 --> 10:21.483
was a fucking mistake, which
happened because I'm so fucking upset.

10:21.567 --> 10:24.684
From this point forward,
I'll handle that earless cunt.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.606
Top two bags.

10:42.607 --> 10:45.838
- May I help you with your bags, miss?
- No, you can't.

10:45.927 --> 10:48.646
Or look at me or talk to me
until I've took a bath.

10:48.727 --> 10:50.524
Follow the quagmire then, ma'am.

10:50.607 --> 10:53.326
The establishment you want
is the last on the right.

10:53.407 --> 10:55.967
Take this lady's luggage
to the Chez Ami.

10:56.047 --> 10:57.082
Yes, sir.

10:57.167 --> 11:00.523
Do not look at her or talk to her
until she's bathed.

11:08.287 --> 11:09.640
Mr Wolcott.

11:10.647 --> 11:15.243
Deceptively fair weather,
given the devastating rumours.

11:15.727 --> 11:17.638
Less volume, Mr Farnum.

11:17.887 --> 11:19.718
- More conviction.
- Yes.

11:21.407 --> 11:23.967
- Your hotel?
- Yes, it is, sir.

11:25.327 --> 11:26.885
- Your luggage?
- Yes.

11:26.967 --> 11:29.083
May I install it
in one of our better rooms?

11:29.167 --> 11:30.395
Please.

11:31.607 --> 11:33.802
Direct me to the Bella Union.

11:34.047 --> 11:36.481
Not 50 yards as the bird flies...

11:36.567 --> 11:39.127
or a man who is lead on by his prick...

11:39.207 --> 11:42.244
or needing to test his luck.

11:42.927 --> 11:45.043
To whom shall I assign the room?

11:45.127 --> 11:46.526
Hugo Jarry.

11:46.607 --> 11:49.360
E.B. Farnum, owner-proprietor.

11:49.887 --> 11:53.402
Also mayor, though that position
is largely ceremonial.

11:54.047 --> 11:57.323
Lawrence County Commissioner.
The position is real.

12:00.207 --> 12:03.040
Hello, Jarry. Commissioner Jarry.

12:04.367 --> 12:07.996
Commissioner Jarry now, yes,
as of the last five days.

12:08.687 --> 12:10.564
Delighted to find you here, Adams.

12:10.647 --> 12:12.239
You could have known
my next whereabouts...

12:12.327 --> 12:14.921
if you'd talked to me in Yankton
where I sat outside your office...

12:15.007 --> 12:16.440
for half a fucking day.

12:16.527 --> 12:19.041
It seemed to many of us in Yankton...

12:19.127 --> 12:22.802
that in the aftermath of
Magistrate Clagett's disappearance...

12:22.887 --> 12:25.117
you chose different companions.

12:25.207 --> 12:29.120
Last I saw Clagett,
he rode in here with General Crook.

12:29.207 --> 12:30.845
I figured he left with him, too.

12:30.927 --> 12:32.679
And perhaps was plucked up...

12:32.767 --> 12:35.565
subsequently from amidst the troops
by savages.

12:35.647 --> 12:40.323
Such moonlight treachery
being their stealthy hallmark.

12:40.407 --> 12:43.479
Maybe he took a bribe from someone,
didn't hold up his end...

12:43.567 --> 12:45.444
got his just desserts.

12:45.527 --> 12:48.803
That's of no personal interest to me
or anyone in Yankton...

12:48.887 --> 12:52.243
any more than
your choice of companions.

12:52.327 --> 12:54.636
If you're trying
to freeze out Swearengen...

12:54.727 --> 12:58.766
before the Governor makes his play,
you are betting the wrong way.

12:58.967 --> 13:00.685
Someone certainly is.

13:00.767 --> 13:03.156
Anyways, I'll tell him I saw you.

13:03.567 --> 13:07.401
I have a close schedule.
Otherwise, I'd pay the respects myself.

13:09.927 --> 13:12.316
I wonder if you will let me pass.

13:22.687 --> 13:26.123
I only hope, Marvin,
you ain't privy to information that I ain't.

13:26.207 --> 13:28.801
$600 US, Mr Tolliver.

13:28.967 --> 13:30.958
Claim 16 above discovery.

13:31.527 --> 13:34.803
That ain't responsive to my previous
fucking statement, young man.

13:34.887 --> 13:38.277
I tell you what, sir.
It's the fucking altitude that's got to me.

13:38.367 --> 13:39.436
I see.

13:39.527 --> 13:42.246
Nosebleeds
and every fucking thing else.

13:43.127 --> 13:45.687
Well, your health's got to come first.

13:45.767 --> 13:46.882
Leon!

13:48.327 --> 13:50.238
Light as my kit's got...

13:50.647 --> 13:52.877
we can go ahead and say done.

13:54.287 --> 13:57.165
- $600, Con.
- Right here, sir.

14:04.247 --> 14:06.636
Jesus Christ, don't pay it to me.

14:06.887 --> 14:09.196
Marvin here will shoot us both.

14:10.727 --> 14:13.560
- Here you go, Marvin.
- You lettered, Marvin?

14:14.087 --> 14:16.317
I'm up to making my X, sir.

14:16.407 --> 14:19.399
- Con, you sign as a witness.
- Will do, sir.

14:19.807 --> 14:23.800
Don't be looking over my shoulder
when I'm signing my fucking X.

14:27.287 --> 14:30.359
Don't ever say that to me again.
You surprised yourself.

14:30.447 --> 14:31.800
It's what happened.

14:31.887 --> 14:35.960
I don't want to hear it spoken of
because it darkens my thoughts.

14:36.527 --> 14:39.439
- About who you're partnered with?
- Exactly.

14:41.047 --> 14:43.197
They get led by their dicks.

14:43.407 --> 14:46.160
Our cunts lead us,
we lose our only edge.

14:46.247 --> 14:48.397
That wasn't what was going on.

14:49.167 --> 14:51.965
Was it worse?
Were you angry at him, Joanie?

14:52.047 --> 14:54.117
Was that what surprised you?

14:54.207 --> 14:55.606
How angry you were...

14:55.687 --> 14:59.362
that George Hearst's second
was a cruel and evil man?

15:02.727 --> 15:07.118
Did you think maybe you'd shoot him
to get us little people even?

15:07.847 --> 15:11.237
I took that gun into the room with me
to protect myself.

15:11.327 --> 15:14.399
Who fucking asked you
to go into the room with him?

15:14.487 --> 15:17.604
Nobody gets even. We get dead.

15:18.447 --> 15:21.405
But before I go, I intend a long
and comfortable retirement...

15:21.487 --> 15:24.365
and that cocksucker's
gonna pay the freight.

15:24.727 --> 15:27.560
Something terrible
is going to happen here.

15:29.447 --> 15:32.439
You don't even know the girl
he wants to harm.

15:37.287 --> 15:38.845
You stay the fuck out of it.

15:38.927 --> 15:40.519
He tipped you!

15:42.567 --> 15:45.001
This whole place smells like shit.

15:53.967 --> 15:57.403
It is no disloyalty
to be a realist, Richardson.

15:57.487 --> 15:59.079
We are mortal.

15:59.167 --> 16:03.126
One hopes for the best.
One perseveres.

16:04.207 --> 16:08.041
One re-evaluates constantly.
One is an asshole if one doesn't.

16:10.207 --> 16:13.483
Loyalty expanded is not loyalty betrayed.

16:13.727 --> 16:17.163
I contemplate no disloyalty
to Al Swearengen.

16:23.447 --> 16:25.005
I feel exposed.

16:25.967 --> 16:29.039
I don't like being weak,
and I know that I am.

16:30.847 --> 16:33.805
I yearn to rely on a stronger will.

16:35.767 --> 16:39.726
I fear what I'm capable of
in its absence.

16:47.327 --> 16:51.036
Whereas you, Richardson,
know nothing of yourself.

16:51.807 --> 16:55.880
Are you shitting or going blind?
Or on foot or horseback?

16:56.687 --> 16:59.281
You vile, fucking lump!

17:04.367 --> 17:07.040
Bury that offal in the Shepherd's Pie.

17:13.247 --> 17:14.646
God damn it!

17:18.247 --> 17:19.919
May I go up today?

17:21.767 --> 17:24.884
- How long is my fucking sentence?
- Any messages?

17:26.607 --> 17:29.804
Is there any fucking chance you and me
don't end up in blood?

17:29.887 --> 17:33.562
Any of you realising that the sun
don't rise and set on me and you?

17:33.647 --> 17:35.524
What the fuck does that fucking mean?

17:35.607 --> 17:37.325
Means there may be
other fucking factors...

17:37.407 --> 17:39.284
factored into my decision-making.

17:39.367 --> 17:42.598
Besides the fact that I find you to be
a pain in the balls, personally.

17:42.687 --> 17:47.124
Please report: Commissioner Jarry
from Yankton has arrived to the camp...

17:47.247 --> 17:49.681
and intends to fuck Al up the ass.

17:49.967 --> 17:52.527
Said he to you while doing the same?

17:54.647 --> 17:57.480
It is important that he hear that.

17:58.887 --> 18:01.879
You do him disservice not to tell.

18:06.767 --> 18:08.280
Listen, Adams.

18:10.407 --> 18:12.398
Al is fucked up bad.

18:13.047 --> 18:14.446
Maybe dying.

18:16.047 --> 18:18.277
- Jesus.
- Goddamn right, Jesus.

18:19.167 --> 18:21.635
Them stones have done plumb
blocked off his piss passage.

18:21.727 --> 18:22.842
Fuck!

18:25.327 --> 18:27.363
- Okay. All right.
- It's all backed up in him.

18:27.447 --> 18:29.881
Hey, shit, he's got piss in his lungs.

18:29.967 --> 18:32.561
- Can he talk?
- Fuck no, he can't talk.

18:32.887 --> 18:35.845
He just lays there and shivers
and stares at nothing.

18:35.927 --> 18:40.478
He screams when Doc abuses him
with them fucking prick poles of his.

18:43.247 --> 18:45.238
Sorry I broke your balls.

18:46.247 --> 18:48.681
I'll see to it he gets your news...

18:48.767 --> 18:52.043
if he gets to a point
I think he can understand my meaning.

18:55.487 --> 18:59.082
Listen, how's your little buddy,
the one I put the beating on?

18:59.167 --> 19:01.123
- Hawkeye.
- Yeah, Hawkeye.

19:02.087 --> 19:03.440
He'll live.

19:09.167 --> 19:11.078
It's something, anyway.

19:17.807 --> 19:20.685
- Morning, ma'am.
- Good morning, Mr Ellsworth.

19:20.767 --> 19:24.123
I'm sorry I'm late.
I hope you spent a restful night.

19:24.287 --> 19:26.357
I did. And you're forgiven.

19:27.767 --> 19:31.965
But this morning,
I note an amount of confusion...

19:33.367 --> 19:36.677
and anxiety abound,
and words of panic...

19:36.847 --> 19:39.122
about Yankton's disposition
of the claims.

19:39.207 --> 19:42.643
Panic's easier on the back
than the short-handled shovel.

19:43.607 --> 19:44.756
I see.

19:48.127 --> 19:52.678
The Creator, in His infinite wisdom,
Mrs Garret, salted His works...

19:52.767 --> 19:57.283
so that where gold was
there also you'd find rumour.

19:58.047 --> 20:02.404
Though, He decreed just as firm
that the opposite wouldn't always hold.

20:03.487 --> 20:06.206
You understand
I needn't be comforted...

20:06.647 --> 20:08.797
at the expense of the truth.

20:09.207 --> 20:12.836
I'm late, ma'am, over shooing a man
away from your digging's...

20:12.927 --> 20:16.840
named Francis Wolcott,
that scouts for George Hearst...

20:17.567 --> 20:20.957
who wouldn't spare attention for a camp
or the sun itself...

20:21.047 --> 20:23.766
if he didn't think it likely
to fill his coffers.

20:23.967 --> 20:26.481
Nor the sort who'd shrink from a lie...

20:26.567 --> 20:29.445
or more than one,
to advance his purpose...

20:29.527 --> 20:33.042
or be ignorant
of how to circulate his falsehoods...

20:33.127 --> 20:35.641
without anyone knowing their source.

20:37.167 --> 20:41.285
And now I come to camp
to hear the waters called muddy...

20:41.367 --> 20:45.679
and the current quickened,
though I see no change in the creek.

20:46.927 --> 20:48.724
And the hooples...

20:49.647 --> 20:52.719
certain sure the flood crest
fast approaches...

20:52.807 --> 20:55.924
have begun to think keenly...

20:56.967 --> 20:59.003
"I'll get ahead of the event.

20:59.087 --> 21:01.760
"Maybe I'll sell my claim at discount. "

21:02.287 --> 21:06.485
Anything to unharness
so they can head for the higher ground.

21:07.327 --> 21:08.965
Myself, ma'am...

21:10.047 --> 21:12.766
I'd be betting that the levy will hold.

21:22.687 --> 21:25.360
Did you speak of it
to Mr Bullock, Mama?

21:25.567 --> 21:28.639
- Not yet, William.
- Will you speak of it today?

21:29.967 --> 21:31.958
Good morning, Mr Bullock.

21:32.447 --> 21:33.926
Good morning.

21:35.047 --> 21:38.119
Oatmeal, Seth?

21:39.967 --> 21:41.923
Please, Martha.

21:42.687 --> 21:45.918
Mr Bullock,
Mother was wanting a kitchen garden...

21:46.007 --> 21:48.077
which I would have care of.

21:48.487 --> 21:50.205
Have you chosen a spot yet?

21:50.287 --> 21:53.085
I paced one out
in the back of the house, sir.

21:53.167 --> 21:55.886
Yesterday, I would have
broken the ground...

21:55.967 --> 21:58.083
but from wanting the tools.

21:58.247 --> 22:00.283
Would you like to go now
and tell Mr Star...

22:00.367 --> 22:01.766
you need shovel, hoe and a rake?

22:01.847 --> 22:03.121
Yes, sir.

22:03.447 --> 22:05.642
Do you recall your way
to the hardware store?

22:05.727 --> 22:07.046
I do, sir.

22:07.127 --> 22:09.322
Is it okay if I go now, Mama?

22:36.687 --> 22:39.804
- Mrs Garret.
- Mr Farnum.

22:49.727 --> 22:51.126
Mrs Garret?

22:51.327 --> 22:56.003
What male would not trade
our small superiority of intellect...

22:56.527 --> 22:58.245
to possess that...

22:58.327 --> 23:02.081
gift of intuition so bountifully bestowed
on the lesser sex?

23:02.367 --> 23:05.040
Mr Farnum, your meaning is beyond me.

23:05.127 --> 23:08.597
I imagine you, madam,
awakening the other morning...

23:08.687 --> 23:11.326
suddenly and for no earthly reason...

23:11.687 --> 23:13.996
convinced the camp was at peril.

23:14.727 --> 23:17.525
"My gold should be spirited to Denver"...

23:18.127 --> 23:22.006
I imagine you thinking,
maybe as you brushed your hair...

23:22.167 --> 23:25.876
and without worrying the conviction
or studying upon it...

23:26.407 --> 23:28.238
sending the gold away.

23:28.487 --> 23:31.684
At peril? Mr Farnum, the camp?

23:33.047 --> 23:35.083
Your meaning is beyond me.

23:38.687 --> 23:43.317
Ma'am, if a Nubian genie
were at my disposal...

23:43.687 --> 23:47.043
I'd see his great nigger fingers
whisk up my hotel...

23:47.127 --> 23:50.437
and deposit it in Denver,
just as you did your gold.

23:51.687 --> 23:53.837
Because the camp's at peril?

23:53.927 --> 23:55.838
Yes, madam, yes. Peril.

23:57.047 --> 23:58.844
And worse than peril.

24:00.767 --> 24:02.758
Perhaps you should sell.

24:03.007 --> 24:07.319
Mrs Garret, had I your intuition,
would I not have done.

24:10.087 --> 24:11.486
I'll buy it.

24:13.447 --> 24:17.281
Aren't you wonderful and kind
and intuitive and generous.

24:17.447 --> 24:21.281
No, I couldn't burden you,
nor impose upon your generosity...

24:21.367 --> 24:23.517
tremendously wealthy as you are.

24:25.687 --> 24:29.475
Name your price, Mr Farnum.
We'll close the transaction now.

24:29.647 --> 24:32.525
Madam, now you unsettle
and trifle with me.

24:32.967 --> 24:35.959
And make me nervous and uncertain.

24:36.527 --> 24:40.361
My intention is quite otherwise,
and intuition.

24:40.447 --> 24:42.165
Oh, your intuition?

24:43.087 --> 24:44.725
Name your price.

24:45.327 --> 24:47.318
How do you males put it?

24:47.527 --> 24:49.643
"Shit or get off the chamber pot?"

24:49.727 --> 24:52.560
Mrs Garret, shit, indeed. Oh, dear.

24:52.887 --> 24:54.684
Unless, Mr Farnum...

24:56.527 --> 24:58.757
Unless, what, madam?
Do you reconsider?

24:58.847 --> 25:00.041
No, no.

25:00.207 --> 25:02.516
I'd understand.
It's your sex's prerogative-

25:02.607 --> 25:06.759
Unless, I meant to say,
you're lying about the camp's peril?

25:07.007 --> 25:08.281
Lying? I?

25:09.167 --> 25:11.078
But why would you do that?

25:11.567 --> 25:12.795
Exactly.

25:14.527 --> 25:16.563
You will make a price for me then.

25:16.647 --> 25:18.842
Let me consider, Mrs Garret.

25:19.847 --> 25:23.317
Don't, Mr Farnum. Trust your instincts.

25:25.287 --> 25:27.801
I'll have you in a dress in no time.

25:33.447 --> 25:35.722
Miserable, haughty cunt.

25:36.367 --> 25:38.437
Putting me beyond my depth.

25:40.767 --> 25:44.282
We've come to a crisis, Al,
and I have to say my piece.

25:45.407 --> 25:50.276
The stones can be excised surgically
in one of two ways.

25:50.967 --> 25:53.117
The so-called "high method"...

25:53.207 --> 25:55.960
which cuts into the bladder
from above your penis...

25:56.047 --> 25:58.242
and the other which enters from below.

25:58.327 --> 26:00.716
- Below what, Doc?
- His balls.

26:01.007 --> 26:05.364
So, the "low" entails
cutting through his taint.

26:09.287 --> 26:12.563
Now, I have seen
the high method performed.

26:13.167 --> 26:17.160
I assisted at a closing, afterwards
discussed it with the surgeon.

26:17.247 --> 26:20.125
Come to it,
that is the one that I would prefer.

26:21.927 --> 26:24.521
- Al's with you.
- How'd he indicate it?

26:25.887 --> 26:30.244
A hard blink for the upper and a scowl
for cutting through his taint.

26:30.727 --> 26:33.241
With a knife in expert hands...

26:33.447 --> 26:35.244
two men in 10...

26:36.087 --> 26:38.726
survive the procedure we contemplate.

26:39.287 --> 26:42.165
But at what point, without intervention...

26:42.327 --> 26:46.639
will your condition so worsen
as to put you beyond recovery?

26:47.047 --> 26:49.402
I believe we have approached that point.

26:49.487 --> 26:54.083
I am not an expert,
but I will give it my best effort...

26:54.567 --> 26:58.401
and I ask you now for your consent,
should we need to proceed.

26:58.967 --> 27:01.197
He's with you, Doc. He wants the upper.

27:01.287 --> 27:04.597
Hey, that's it. That's the final call.
Right, Al? The upper?

27:05.527 --> 27:06.960
He wants the upper.

27:07.607 --> 27:10.041
Well, I guess you better go make ready.

27:10.127 --> 27:11.446
All right.

27:11.967 --> 27:15.004
All right. Come with me, Johnny.

27:15.367 --> 27:17.835
- Help me with this stove.
- Sure. Sure, Doc.

27:35.327 --> 27:39.002
As to claims filed
and worked prior to the new treaty...

27:39.087 --> 27:42.079
in essence from when the hills
still belonged to the Sioux...

27:42.167 --> 27:44.681
the presumption of legitimacy
will apply...

27:44.767 --> 27:47.839
subject to qualification,
according to mitigating facts.

27:47.927 --> 27:51.476
In short, with no controlling principle
being invoked...

27:52.087 --> 27:54.920
title will be determined
on a case-by-case basis.

27:55.007 --> 27:59.159
When claims are overturned, new title
will be awarded at said prices...

27:59.247 --> 28:02.603
via lottery,
to those submitting verified offers.

28:03.447 --> 28:07.645
I only hope territorial officials
will be excluded from eligibility.

28:07.847 --> 28:08.916
Yes.

28:09.007 --> 28:10.679
Better tell your friends and relatives...

28:10.767 --> 28:12.803
to pick their lucky suits out
for that drawing.

28:12.887 --> 28:15.560
Only after Mr Wolcott's
have picked out theirs.

28:15.647 --> 28:19.322
Of course, anticipation
of the forthcoming judicial holding...

28:19.407 --> 28:22.046
may itself largely cleanse the market.

28:22.207 --> 28:26.166
It's always preferable to allow
the market to operate unimpeded.

28:26.767 --> 28:29.679
Would that argue
for allowing word of my presence...

28:29.767 --> 28:33.760
to circulate a bit
before presenting myself officially?

28:34.207 --> 28:37.836
Man might use that time
to put some stink on his johnson.

28:44.727 --> 28:45.876
Hello?

28:46.327 --> 28:48.557
Down here. Behind the counter.

28:50.887 --> 28:52.525
Taking inventory.

28:57.447 --> 28:59.483
I can't do a lesson today.

28:59.807 --> 29:01.126
All right.

29:01.687 --> 29:03.166
He's too sick.

29:03.807 --> 29:07.117
Maybe he'll fucking die. But I can't stay.

29:10.127 --> 29:13.642
But it'd be smart to stay and learn
to calculate fucking interest...

29:13.727 --> 29:17.242
on that accommodation paper
and those fucking discount notes...

29:17.327 --> 29:19.158
and whatever the fuck.

29:19.967 --> 29:23.323
Another time. It's fine, Trixie.

29:26.887 --> 29:29.117
- Did I hurt your shoulder?
- No.

29:32.807 --> 29:34.206
I gotta go.

29:41.807 --> 29:43.798
Want to go out for a bit?

29:44.407 --> 29:46.682
She says Swearengen's bad off.

29:47.167 --> 29:49.362
Last night I heard him screaming out
again and again.

29:49.447 --> 29:51.915
I guess he's worsened with the day.

29:58.327 --> 30:00.841
Thanks for outfitting the boy
with garden equipment.

30:00.927 --> 30:03.725
He's planning to take some prizes
come harvest fair.

30:03.807 --> 30:06.275
He mentioned corn and squash, both.

30:06.887 --> 30:08.718
I had some news from Denver...

30:09.207 --> 30:11.801
concerning our proposal on the bank.

30:12.247 --> 30:15.478
We'd need to find 15%
of our proposed capitalisation.

30:15.567 --> 30:17.603
If we capitalise at the $2 million
we figured on-

30:17.687 --> 30:20.963
$300,000 separate from what
Denver will underwrite.

30:21.967 --> 30:24.686
Or they'd credit Mrs Garret's accounts
as collateral.

30:24.767 --> 30:26.086
Not doing that.

30:26.167 --> 30:27.202
I don't advocate it.

30:27.287 --> 30:30.040
I'm informing you of a communication
they volunteered.

30:30.127 --> 30:31.162
We're not doing that.

30:31.247 --> 30:34.284
Suppose I'll have to dip
into my own kit, then.

30:34.567 --> 30:36.797
Even so,
it's back to cutting my own hair.

30:36.887 --> 30:38.923
I'll take the idea around.

30:39.007 --> 30:40.599
Swearengen would put it up.

30:40.687 --> 30:42.279
Fucking reputable people.

30:42.367 --> 30:45.006
If money had to be clean
before it was recirculated...

30:45.087 --> 30:47.362
we'd still be living in fucking caves.

30:47.447 --> 30:49.915
- Your old man?
- Me.

30:52.167 --> 30:55.204
Mr Lee will provide opium
to you exclusively...

30:55.287 --> 30:57.039
for sale to whites in the camp.

30:57.127 --> 30:59.163
You will receive
50% of the gaming proceeds...

30:59.247 --> 31:00.441
from Celestial's Alley.

31:00.527 --> 31:02.199
My men will lamp the take.

31:02.287 --> 31:05.518
It will spare Mr Lee here
explaining how slow business was...

31:05.607 --> 31:07.882
'cause of Buddha's
wedding anniversary.

31:07.967 --> 31:09.400
Your men lamp the take...

31:09.487 --> 31:12.399
also on proceeds
from Celestial prostitutes.

31:12.567 --> 31:15.639
- How many do you want?
- How many can you bring?

31:17.847 --> 31:18.916
How many?

31:19.007 --> 31:22.477
That sounds like a man
with an inexhaustible supply.

31:24.207 --> 31:26.675
How much English do you have,
my friend?

31:29.767 --> 31:32.679
Maybe when we get to know
each other better.

31:33.567 --> 31:36.206
I'll take a dozen,
and I don't want them fucked out.

31:36.287 --> 31:38.084
I set the rates. The upkeep's on him.

31:38.167 --> 31:40.920
And my understanding is
the upkeep is quite minimal.

31:41.007 --> 31:44.477
Good! Gives him more to spend
on mahjong.

31:46.767 --> 31:50.806
I won't question the apparent
one-sidedness of our arrangement.

31:51.487 --> 31:54.843
The arrangement is not yours
and Mr Lee's alone.

31:55.007 --> 31:57.760
Yes, and in ways
I don't understand...

31:57.847 --> 32:01.681
it must benefit you and the man
whose name I must never say...

32:01.767 --> 32:03.758
to have Mr Lee in camp...

32:04.647 --> 32:06.922
and perhaps Mr Wu out of it...

32:07.007 --> 32:10.158
maybe among the spirits
of his ancestors.

32:11.807 --> 32:14.526
But what a blessing for me,
finally to reach a point in life...

32:14.607 --> 32:17.075
where I don't feel I have to know.

32:23.687 --> 32:26.406
A creature walking around on hind legs.

32:28.087 --> 32:31.159
Just like Crop Ear
and them half-dozen bushwhackers...

32:31.247 --> 32:33.044
out in the forests...

32:33.487 --> 32:38.242
ones I'd fall in with or out,
whatever suited my daily purpose.

32:40.807 --> 32:43.879
That's what I was
till I crossed paths with Al.

32:45.287 --> 32:49.803
Well, bang the drum and play the pipes
and I'll rend our fucking garments.

32:51.287 --> 32:52.959
I was just saying.

32:53.047 --> 32:55.925
I ain't hearing confessions
this afternoon.

33:02.927 --> 33:05.521
Say you'll burn it down with me, Dan.

33:06.007 --> 33:07.122
What?

33:09.047 --> 33:10.878
This fucking place...

33:12.087 --> 33:14.726
before letting Tolliver take it over.

33:17.767 --> 33:18.916
Done.

33:27.887 --> 33:29.923
Well, open your mouth, Jewel,
and say something...

33:30.007 --> 33:32.123
we can't fucking understand!

33:32.207 --> 33:33.959
He's asking for you.

33:37.287 --> 33:39.755
Don't die with your fucking secret.

33:42.967 --> 33:46.676
Clean the number three.
Dolly said she bled.

33:54.287 --> 33:55.686
God damn it!

33:58.887 --> 34:01.640
I may get me a whiskey, Doc.
You need any whiskey?

34:01.727 --> 34:04.287
No, I do not want a fucking whiskey.

34:05.167 --> 34:08.239
Well, maybe as far
as steadying the hand.

34:08.527 --> 34:12.645
How dare you?
You shut your fucking mouth!

34:13.407 --> 34:15.556
I didn't mean nothing by it.

34:16.367 --> 34:19.279
Whiskey does not steady the hand.

34:19.607 --> 34:23.395
It just dulls the worry
over the hand's unsteadiness.

34:23.847 --> 34:28.637
Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ,
I do not need to kill another man!

34:30.567 --> 34:31.681
Fuck!

34:35.847 --> 34:37.996
Top left corner of my fucking bag.

34:38.087 --> 34:39.202
For what?

34:39.687 --> 34:43.998
Balm, you fucking idiot, against the burn
you fucking just sustained.

34:46.806 --> 34:48.206
Thanks, Doc.

34:49.246 --> 34:50.600
All right.

35:02.007 --> 35:04.601
- Dan.
- Go away, Wu.

35:04.887 --> 35:06.525
- Swearengen.
- No.

35:07.007 --> 35:10.079
- Swearengen.
- Well, it ain't gonna happen.

35:10.607 --> 35:13.565
- Swearengen.
- No, Wu! He's fucked up.

35:14.047 --> 35:16.800
Now, Al can't talk to you right now,
and I can't understand you...

35:16.887 --> 35:19.162
so you go the fuck back to Chink Alley!

35:19.407 --> 35:22.558
Do not start drawing air
to talk gibberish to me!

35:27.887 --> 35:29.366
Cocksucker!

35:29.447 --> 35:31.722
- For Christ's sake.
- Cocksucker!

35:32.607 --> 35:34.484
It's wasted on me, Wu.

35:34.567 --> 35:35.920
Cocksucker! Cocksucker!

35:36.007 --> 35:39.795
I don't get it, Wu.
I am not as smart as Al.

35:39.887 --> 35:42.640
And there's too much on our
fucking plate right now to deal with it.

35:42.727 --> 35:46.686
- Cocksucker! San Francisco.
- Jesus fucking Christ!

35:46.767 --> 35:50.077
All right, there's an invisible cocksucker
next to you...

35:50.167 --> 35:52.362
and he's from San Francisco.

35:52.887 --> 35:53.956
Cocksucker.

35:54.047 --> 35:56.641
- San Francisco cocksucker.
- I'm going with...

35:56.727 --> 35:59.480
You want me to tell Al
that there's a cocksucker.

35:59.567 --> 36:01.125
He looks like...

36:01.767 --> 36:04.361
He looks like you
and he's from San Francisco...

36:04.447 --> 36:07.245
and he's got your dander up.
I'm going up now. I'll go tell him.

36:07.327 --> 36:09.602
- Tell him what?
- God only knows.

36:09.847 --> 36:12.361
Why don't you learn to talk American?

36:12.447 --> 36:14.677
Save us all a lot of fucking trouble!

36:14.767 --> 36:16.439
Wu know Englishing.

36:28.007 --> 36:29.759
Mr Adams? Good day.

36:30.287 --> 36:32.437
Good day, Miss Isringhausen.

36:33.327 --> 36:36.842
I can't imagine what you
must be thinking at the moment.

36:37.847 --> 36:39.439
Please, come in.

36:47.327 --> 36:51.366
I can offer you a whiskey
or water that I just washed my face in.

36:51.927 --> 36:53.883
I will have whiskey, sir.

36:53.967 --> 36:55.082
Sure.

36:57.887 --> 37:00.924
I've just been discharged. Sacked!

37:02.567 --> 37:04.080
By Mrs Garret?

37:04.527 --> 37:06.358
As tutor for her ward.

37:12.887 --> 37:15.640
Well, I hope you punched her
in the nose.

37:20.487 --> 37:24.116
This is a day of firsts.
Dismissal from employment...

37:24.207 --> 37:26.846
unchaperoned presence
in a man's room.

37:27.687 --> 37:30.360
I'm sorry for your news,
Miss Isringhausen...

37:30.447 --> 37:32.597
but if that's your first taste of liquor...

37:32.687 --> 37:35.918
I'm sorry for the hand
you've been playing your whole life.

37:40.327 --> 37:43.364
- You mind if I drink from the bottle?
- No, sir.

37:49.767 --> 37:50.995
Oh, boy.

37:53.327 --> 37:55.841
- Oh, boy.
- I'm sorry.

37:56.887 --> 37:59.640
- You want me to get out of here?
- It's your room.

37:59.727 --> 38:04.278
That's okay. You're not a thief.
Or would you feel better if I shot myself?

38:07.127 --> 38:08.879
Why do you say that?

38:10.087 --> 38:13.841
I apologise. It was just a stupid way
of trying to be funny.

38:15.007 --> 38:17.282
Because I fear I may be killed.

38:18.927 --> 38:20.042
What?

38:20.447 --> 38:22.005
I can't explain.

38:22.087 --> 38:25.284
It's nightmarish. It's incomprehensible.

38:25.847 --> 38:27.997
Who's threatening your life?

38:30.647 --> 38:32.080
Mrs Garret.

38:32.527 --> 38:34.404
I know it sounds impossible...

38:34.487 --> 38:36.478
but I can testify to you, Mr Adams...

38:36.567 --> 38:39.206
I would not be the first person
she's killed.

38:43.367 --> 38:45.961
You want I should tie him high
or tie him low?

38:46.047 --> 38:47.560
Tie him high.

38:47.647 --> 38:50.844
Should we go ahead and put a good
fucking hit of dope down him, Doc?

38:50.927 --> 38:53.725
Yeah, go ahead and get a hit ready.

38:54.487 --> 38:57.081
Al, I have to secure you for surgery!

38:57.847 --> 38:59.360
What is it, Al?

39:06.527 --> 39:07.926
He's afraid.

39:11.367 --> 39:12.766
You afraid, Al?

39:13.687 --> 39:15.359
You've got a fear of the knife.

39:15.447 --> 39:17.722
He wants to try
passing them stones natural.

39:17.807 --> 39:19.525
Are you afraid, Al?

39:20.567 --> 39:22.364
Are you afraid, Al?

39:23.287 --> 39:25.676
Oh, God! I'm on his fucking nuts!

39:26.727 --> 39:31.084
God damn! Smelling salts
is what we're going to administer!

39:31.167 --> 39:32.361
Do you hear me, Al?

39:32.447 --> 39:35.120
Here is a fucking dose...

39:35.207 --> 39:37.596
of smelling salts to your nose!

39:38.727 --> 39:40.046
What are you doing, Doc?

39:40.127 --> 39:43.483
Be quiet! Sit him up
and get him to his goddamn feet!

39:44.807 --> 39:46.525
Take his prick out!

39:46.727 --> 39:48.922
Come on! Come on, Al!

39:49.087 --> 39:51.885
Come on! Come on, Al!

39:51.967 --> 39:54.083
There you come, Al! There you come!

39:54.167 --> 39:56.476
- There you go! You're doing it!
- There you come, Al.

39:56.567 --> 40:00.162
There you go,
you ox-minded son of a gun!

40:01.767 --> 40:04.884
- Push at it, you bastard! Push at it!
- Come on, Al!

40:04.967 --> 40:07.606
You'd do a horse proud
with the strength of that fucking stream!

40:07.687 --> 40:10.281
Lay him down. Lay Al down on the bed!

40:11.447 --> 40:13.802
We are gonna take care of this.

40:14.487 --> 40:18.162
I'm gonna put this instrument back
inside you and clear that cocksucker...

40:18.247 --> 40:21.523
you've been making progress with,
and we are not gonna cut you!

40:21.607 --> 40:24.405
Bring his knee up to his chest.
You hold him down.

40:24.487 --> 40:28.605
- Johnny, you go on out to the balcony.
- I have charge of the salts!

40:30.047 --> 40:31.400
All right!

40:34.487 --> 40:38.162
All right!
I can feel the fucking click of the gleet!

40:39.167 --> 40:42.125
All right, now,
I want you to milk his prick.

40:42.367 --> 40:46.360
From top to bottom, and I want you
to bring that cocksucker down.

40:46.447 --> 40:47.880
That's it.

40:48.287 --> 40:50.039
- There.
- Come on, Al.

40:50.447 --> 40:54.918
All right! Look at it!
One gleet chasing a-fucking-nother!

40:56.407 --> 40:58.238
God bless you, Al!

40:58.767 --> 41:00.246
Thank you.

41:00.327 --> 41:03.125
Thank you for saving me, God.

41:14.567 --> 41:17.286
- Are you uncomfortable, girls?
- They're fine.

41:17.367 --> 41:19.756
You're paying them
to stand in their position, Mr W...

41:19.847 --> 41:21.724
they'll stand in their position.

41:21.807 --> 41:24.480
They've been
in more awkward positions before.

41:24.967 --> 41:29.245
Thousands of years ago, in Cyprus,
women went about their own lives...

41:29.327 --> 41:31.636
only after first spending time
as prostitutes...

41:31.727 --> 41:33.524
at the temple of Aphrodite.

41:33.607 --> 41:35.598
The tribute of their promiscuity...

41:35.687 --> 41:38.997
meant to secure for the island
the goddess's grant of bountiful crops...

41:39.087 --> 41:40.918
and beautiful weather.

41:42.047 --> 41:46.404
Woman's generative instrument
on the altar of the race's necessities...

41:46.887 --> 41:49.720
have we not come some far piece
since then?

41:50.367 --> 41:53.200
Who, for example,
fucks on altars anymore?

41:53.447 --> 41:56.245
Or pretends anything can make up
the weather's mind?

41:56.327 --> 41:59.000
Are you gonna
fuck me tonight, Francis?

41:59.327 --> 42:00.919
I bore Carrie.

42:04.847 --> 42:07.645
You were peeking.
I asked you not to look.

42:07.727 --> 42:08.876
Sorry.

42:11.207 --> 42:13.801
Why not just go do
what you're gonna do, Mr W?

42:13.887 --> 42:15.525
Am I on a schedule then?

42:15.607 --> 42:18.280
She only meant
our educations can wait.

42:18.567 --> 42:21.286
I quite enjoyed our talk the other night.

42:21.367 --> 42:24.962
- Do you want to fuck her?
- No, Carrie. No.

42:26.047 --> 42:27.560
Or I'd say so.

42:29.127 --> 42:31.277
The atmosphere of the room
turns against me.

42:31.367 --> 42:35.838
A growing collective impatience
where should be a haven of indulgence.

42:37.327 --> 42:40.478
- Won't you indulge me?
- We're trying, Mr W.

42:40.927 --> 42:43.077
But you are behaving badly.

42:43.167 --> 42:47.718
Disappointing, from you who I thought
to regale with details of the myths.

42:48.087 --> 42:50.317
Gods fornicating with mortals...

42:51.567 --> 42:53.285
the endless incest.

42:53.727 --> 42:57.163
Fathers upon daughters upon sisters...

43:01.727 --> 43:04.002
Take her in or get out, please.

43:04.607 --> 43:06.643
- Excuse us.
- Of course.

43:09.847 --> 43:13.157
Be generous. I think I've upset her.

43:26.167 --> 43:30.126
- Well, whatever were you aiming at?
- Your titties!

43:34.727 --> 43:38.197
Any chance in here
of an imminent finish, Commissioner?

43:38.807 --> 43:41.924
My thought being you might want
to deliver our newspaper editor...

43:42.007 --> 43:45.204
a certain document
before he's too drunk to make it out.

43:47.247 --> 43:50.796
I think not, until my bath is finished.

43:53.767 --> 43:55.644
And I think a finish would involve...

43:55.727 --> 43:58.719
you blowing some of them bubbles
underwater, honey.

44:23.207 --> 44:24.356
Eamon.

44:27.687 --> 44:31.077
Has he per any fucking chance
returned from Gayville, Dan...

44:31.167 --> 44:32.885
which he had never been to?

44:32.967 --> 44:34.480
Al's upstairs.

44:35.047 --> 44:39.199
Now if you agree to a few fucking rules,
I'll give you a brief audience with him.

44:39.287 --> 44:41.960
Don't it feel good to play at boss, Dan?

44:42.047 --> 44:45.005
Unless you want to sit down here
and bust my fucking balls...

44:45.087 --> 44:48.124
over you never learning to move
amongst civilised people?

44:48.207 --> 44:51.244
- No, an audience is more important.
- All right.

44:52.767 --> 44:55.565
Now, you listen careful
while we walk up.

44:58.247 --> 45:00.363
You get up there,
you propose a robbery.

45:00.447 --> 45:01.800
You give him the location...

45:01.887 --> 45:04.162
the take that you are prepared
to guarantee...

45:04.247 --> 45:07.444
Al's fee on that take
and then a bonus for overage.

45:07.527 --> 45:09.722
And then, Eamon, you shut the fuck up.

45:09.807 --> 45:11.604
Al has had a tough fucking day.

45:11.687 --> 45:14.121
Now, you let him indicate to you
however he fucking chooses...

45:14.207 --> 45:16.163
as to "yes" or a "no. "

45:16.687 --> 45:18.723
Now that's fair, ain't it?

45:18.887 --> 45:22.800
You're a great man, Dan.
It's you that's the great one.

45:23.167 --> 45:24.441
Don't bust my fucking balls.

45:24.527 --> 45:27.997
Don't call me "Crop Ear,"
you gutless son of a bitch.

45:30.167 --> 45:33.603
Eamon, we live life however we choose.

45:33.847 --> 45:36.805
And you choose life as a cunt
standing behind a bar.

45:36.887 --> 45:40.926
- Just trying to do you a fucking favour.
- I'll have no favours from you!

45:41.247 --> 45:43.681
All right, then. Crop Ears.

45:43.767 --> 45:46.918
Or whatever the fuck it is
you want to be called!

45:52.407 --> 45:56.082
Trying to gauge Al's recovery
and do you a fucking favour.

46:06.687 --> 46:08.643
Crop Ears is dying up there.

46:08.727 --> 46:11.287
Take him over to the Chinaman's
and you throw him away.

46:11.367 --> 46:12.959
Sure, Dan. Sure.

46:13.727 --> 46:15.843
Yeah, I'll go get the sled.

46:16.927 --> 46:19.646
I don't have the patience
for this fucking bullshit!

46:19.727 --> 46:22.002
I have had a tough fucking day!

46:27.287 --> 46:29.676
Were you seeing a relative, Carrie?

46:29.767 --> 46:32.759
Or did the madam withhold you
to frustrate me?

46:34.567 --> 46:37.240
She doesn't tell me
why she does things.

46:37.487 --> 46:40.240
But you'd know
if you were seeing a relative.

46:40.487 --> 46:42.318
Yes. I wasn't.

46:43.207 --> 46:45.118
Were you seeing anyone?

46:47.287 --> 46:51.166
A wild Indian.
I fucked him and I fucked his horse.

46:53.407 --> 46:55.045
You hate it here.

46:56.327 --> 46:58.079
I suppose you don't.

46:58.527 --> 46:59.926
I don't, no.

47:00.767 --> 47:02.837
The rocks tell me stories.

47:03.447 --> 47:05.199
And now I have you.

47:05.407 --> 47:08.922
Well, I'm not a crazy person,
so they don't talk to me.

47:09.287 --> 47:13.405
And I'm with me wherever I am,
so I wish I was in fucking New York.

47:14.487 --> 47:18.321
The rocks don't "talk" to me,
but still I learn their stories.

47:19.367 --> 47:23.201
Oh, I understand now.
Thank you for saying it like I'm a baby.

47:23.607 --> 47:24.881
Well...

47:26.687 --> 47:29.645
- These hills are unimaginably rich.
- So what?

47:30.727 --> 47:34.606
To compel even the vagrant attentions
of someone like my employer.

47:34.687 --> 47:36.837
I won't stay for any amount.

47:37.007 --> 47:40.682
For a large amount,
will you stay for a little?

47:43.327 --> 47:44.965
Give me some now.

47:45.927 --> 47:47.280
Of course.

47:50.847 --> 47:53.156
It's more than I gave the madam.

47:56.647 --> 47:59.605
And you mustn't hit me
like you do the others.

47:59.847 --> 48:01.917
You have never displeased me.

48:08.847 --> 48:12.283
Don't fucking hit me, Francis.

48:12.887 --> 48:14.764
Done. Agreed.

48:27.687 --> 48:29.962
I will run away to the Indians.

48:31.687 --> 48:34.360
You would change the course of history.

48:35.487 --> 48:37.876
Be the first of the women chiefs.

48:47.727 --> 48:49.206
I'm too quick.

48:52.207 --> 48:54.482
You can't be too quick for me.

49:04.487 --> 49:08.480
You might try it sometime
with your prick outside of your pants.

49:10.687 --> 49:13.485
I sense Miss Stubbs
has fucked a relative.

49:13.847 --> 49:15.439
It's a big club.
