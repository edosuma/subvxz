00:11.261 --> 00:13.472
-Get goin', go on -Get goin', go on

00:13.555 --> 00:15.891
-Take friends along -Take friends along

00:15.974 --> 00:18.143
-Go do it all -Go do it all

00:18.227 --> 00:20.103
We all just gotta unplug

00:20.187 --> 00:22.564
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

00:22.648 --> 00:24.942
Just like the way Doug unplugs

00:30.280 --> 00:33.408
Hey. Come on. Drop it.

00:34.368 --> 00:35.786
Drop it.

00:37.162 --> 00:39.581
Yuck. I'm gonna need a new ball.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.502
Incoming!

00:44.044 --> 00:45.712
Get ready to reboot.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.590
Okay, everybotty, gather round.

00:48.674 --> 00:52.469
-Our next project is here. -Looks like a bunch of old stuff.

00:52.553 --> 00:56.181
Then it's a good thing we're rebots. We can turn 'em into something new.

00:56.265 --> 00:58.559
Come on. Let's give these things a reboot.

01:04.982 --> 01:10.487
I'll turn this old jug into that. Initiating reboot!

01:18.328 --> 01:22.165
Look, Becky Bot. I just made a table tennis ball.

01:22.249 --> 01:26.295
Excellent work, Bob Bot. I just made a watering can.

01:26.378 --> 01:29.631
And look, the computer found a human who needs it.

01:29.715 --> 01:32.092
Jenny, you've got some deliveries to make.

01:33.260 --> 01:35.596
Drones, let's zoom.

01:36.263 --> 01:37.389
Good luck, Jenny.

01:37.472 --> 01:38.682
Thanks, Doug!

01:39.308 --> 01:40.559
Hello, Dad.

01:40.976 --> 01:44.813
-What's that? -That is a table tennis ball, Doug.

01:46.023 --> 01:47.191
What's table tennis?

01:47.274 --> 01:50.235
That, I don't know, Doug.

01:50.319 --> 01:52.487
Guess I better plug in to find out.

01:58.327 --> 02:00.704
You put your thumb down Pointer up

02:00.787 --> 02:02.789
Wrap three around the middle

02:03.207 --> 02:07.127
Arm out, step it back And loosen up a little

02:07.211 --> 02:09.003
Tilt for spin Then let's begin

02:09.086 --> 02:10.964
Your serve, then it's mine

02:11.048 --> 02:12.883
Over the net And back again

02:12.966 --> 02:14.968
It's table tennis time

02:16.345 --> 02:20.682
Started way back in England As whiff waff and flim flam

02:20.766 --> 02:22.851
And had to wait Till late '88

02:22.935 --> 02:24.728
Before landing in the Olympics

02:24.811 --> 02:26.855
Now it's everywhere A game to share

02:26.939 --> 02:29.149
So put your paddle up We're singing

02:31.443 --> 02:33.195
We're playing table tennis

02:34.863 --> 02:36.907
It's table tennis time

02:39.243 --> 02:42.371
I see. Table tennis is a game.

02:42.454 --> 02:46.667
But I have a big question. Why do humans play games like table tennis?

02:46.750 --> 02:51.380
We're robots, my sweet bot. We don't ask why. We just do.

02:51.463 --> 02:54.675
Mom's right, son. Our processors are set to reboot.

02:54.758 --> 02:56.260
Bad news, Bob Bot.

02:56.343 --> 03:00.305
The last drone just took off. We can't deliver this ball to Mega City.

03:00.389 --> 03:02.975
What? Great gears!

03:03.559 --> 03:06.228
But this girl really wanted to get it today.

03:06.854 --> 03:09.231
And we always do same-day delivery.

03:09.314 --> 03:10.607
What'll we do?

03:11.066 --> 03:12.359
I could deliver it.

03:12.651 --> 03:14.319
-You, Doug? -Today?

03:14.403 --> 03:17.990
I'd love to help. And I've always wanted to see Mega City.

03:18.949 --> 03:22.286
Okay, Doug. But Mega City is a big place.

03:22.369 --> 03:24.496
So you'll have to follow these coordinates.

03:24.580 --> 03:27.499
-They'll show you where to go. Got it? -Got it.

03:27.583 --> 03:30.502
-Make a speedy delivery, son. -Will do, Dad.

03:32.045 --> 03:34.256
He's such a helpful young bot.

03:34.339 --> 03:39.469
If only there were some way we could show Doug how proud we are of him.

03:39.761 --> 03:44.349
Wait a nanosecond. I know, Becky Bot. Let's make him an app.

03:44.433 --> 03:49.021
Great idea, Bob Bot. Nothing says "we love you" like an app.

03:55.444 --> 03:56.987
Mega City.

04:01.325 --> 04:03.785
Okay. This is the place.

04:06.205 --> 04:07.497
Delivery from Rebot--

04:07.581 --> 04:12.961
Yes! It's here! It's here! I somersault in joy!

04:16.548 --> 04:17.716
Here I go.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.053
Thank you, thank you, Mr...

04:21.428 --> 04:24.348
Hey, are you a boy or a robot?

04:24.431 --> 04:26.517
Both. I'm a boy robot.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.061
Are you from Rebots?

04:29.728 --> 04:30.896
My parents run it.

04:30.979 --> 04:33.982
Cool. So, do you, like, wanna play?

04:34.066 --> 04:36.527
Yes, please. My name's Doug.

04:36.610 --> 04:37.861
Great to meet you, Doug.

04:37.945 --> 04:41.657
I'm Emma, and this is my backyard!

04:43.951 --> 04:47.538
Well, prithee there, daughter. Who's thy new friend?

04:47.621 --> 04:49.206
His name is Doug, Dad.

04:49.581 --> 04:50.707
Hello, Doug.

04:50.791 --> 04:54.127
That's my dad. He's an actor, so he's quite the character.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.966
And that's my good friend Pete.

04:59.550 --> 05:01.760
This is Princess Woofingham.

05:02.302 --> 05:05.097
She's doggy royalty. Your Highness.

05:05.639 --> 05:08.350
And last, but not least,

05:08.433 --> 05:12.646
I present to you our table tennis table!

05:12.938 --> 05:17.526
I was gonna play earlier, but Her Highness kinda chewed up the ball.

05:18.193 --> 05:20.737
Good thing you came with this delivery.

05:23.031 --> 05:25.242
Did you know table tennis started in England?

05:25.325 --> 05:29.746
The game was originally called whiff waff, flim flam and pim pam.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.540
And it is an Olympic sport.

05:31.623 --> 05:36.044
Wow! You know a lot about table tennis. You must play a lot.

05:36.461 --> 05:37.796
I've never played before.

05:37.880 --> 05:40.507
I don't even know... Why do people play games?

05:40.591 --> 05:44.011
What do you mean? We play games 'cause it's fun.

05:44.094 --> 05:45.554
Fun? Never heard of it.

05:45.637 --> 05:48.932
You've never heard of fun?

05:49.016 --> 05:52.311
Wow! Oh, boy! Oh, man! Oh, dear! Wow!

05:52.769 --> 05:54.313
Well, what is it?

05:54.396 --> 05:57.065
Okay, have you ever been sitting around going--

05:58.734 --> 05:59.902
Sometimes.

05:59.985 --> 06:03.530
Well, fun is the exact opposite of that.

06:03.614 --> 06:06.074
It means you're having a really good time.

06:06.366 --> 06:09.703
Here, I'll show you. You can stand over there.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.164
Let's play.

06:14.791 --> 06:17.044
Wait. Was I supposed to hit that?

06:17.544 --> 06:19.713
Yep. Yep, you were.

06:19.796 --> 06:23.717
And we kind of need that ball if we're gonna have fun. Come on!

06:26.094 --> 06:27.596
The ball's bouncing fast.

06:27.679 --> 06:32.059
We can catch it, Emma, with my robo skates. Hop on.

06:32.142 --> 06:34.186
Nice! But is it safe?

06:34.269 --> 06:38.398
Yep, it's safe. I'm a boy robot. I'm programmed not to fall.

06:38.482 --> 06:40.025
Then let's follow that ball.

06:42.319 --> 06:44.321
Ball to the left. Ball to the right!

06:46.532 --> 06:49.493
The ball's up ahead of us! Heading straight for...

06:50.410 --> 06:52.037
that office building!

06:52.663 --> 06:55.541
Oh, no. Only grown-ups are allowed in there.

06:56.375 --> 06:58.418
Guess it's gone for good then.

06:58.502 --> 07:02.798
No way! I promised to show you how to have fun, and we will.

07:02.881 --> 07:06.051
But how will we get in, Emma? We're just kids.

07:06.134 --> 07:07.469
Two kids, Doug.

07:07.553 --> 07:10.597
And by the power of math, two kids can make...

07:11.557 --> 07:13.475
one grown-up.

07:14.643 --> 07:15.811
We do look older.

07:15.894 --> 07:19.439
Now listen, Doug. Nobody can know we're not a grown-up.

07:19.523 --> 07:23.026
So, you're gonna have to speak with a deep voice.

07:23.110 --> 07:27.948
And say things like "morning" and "coffee" and "mortgages."

07:28.031 --> 07:30.367
Now, come on! We gotta get that ball.

07:35.747 --> 07:36.915
Okay, Emma, we're in.

07:36.999 --> 07:39.376
Great. Now remember, Doug, be a grown-up.

07:40.377 --> 07:41.795
-Morning. -Morning.

07:42.337 --> 07:44.214
-Coffee. -Yes, very good.

07:44.882 --> 07:46.508
Emma, there's the ball.

07:46.592 --> 07:48.218
Is that a kid?

07:49.511 --> 07:51.054
Well.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.640
Morning. Coffee. Mortgages?

07:54.808 --> 07:56.268
I need a refill.

07:57.811 --> 07:58.812
It worked.

07:58.896 --> 08:02.482
Told ya. It's all about the deep voice.

08:02.566 --> 08:04.568
Now, quick, grab that ball!

08:06.236 --> 08:10.407
That way! Great gears, Emma. The ball's bouncing back outside.

08:14.786 --> 08:18.332
It's all right, Doug. At least it can't get any worse.

08:22.586 --> 08:24.922
You've gotta be kidding me.

08:25.005 --> 08:28.884
Wow, look at that thing. It's a pit full of balls.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.844
It's called a ball pit, Doug.

08:30.928 --> 08:33.514
We'll have to play in one someday. But right now...

08:34.681 --> 08:38.227
We gotta find that ball so we can finally have some fun!

08:49.655 --> 08:51.156
Whoops, sorry.

08:51.740 --> 08:53.450
Happy birthday, by the way.

08:53.534 --> 08:54.535
I'm two.

08:55.327 --> 08:59.414
Man, how are we ever gonna find that table tennis ball in here?

09:00.082 --> 09:02.292
Wait. Hold your microchips!

09:02.376 --> 09:06.380
Emma, look! The ball's not in here. It's out there.

09:06.713 --> 09:12.302
Yes! There it is, Doug. I somersault in joy!

09:17.266 --> 09:19.017
Nope. Never mind.

09:19.101 --> 09:20.978
I do not somersault in joy.

09:22.855 --> 09:26.149
I'm sorry about the ball, Emma. Rebots can make you another one.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.319
Doug. Doug, Doug, Doug.

09:29.403 --> 09:32.781
I don't care about the ball. It's just...

09:33.657 --> 09:36.910
I really wanted to show you how to have fun today.

09:37.744 --> 09:39.746
-I thought we did. -Really?

09:39.830 --> 09:43.417
Sure! We roller-skated, pretended to be a grown-up,

09:43.500 --> 09:45.210
and swam in a pit full of balls.

09:45.294 --> 09:46.962
I mean, a ball pit.

09:47.045 --> 09:49.631
Anyway, I sure wasn't sitting around going--

09:52.551 --> 09:53.969
You're right, Doug.

09:54.052 --> 09:55.512
-I am? -Yeah!

09:55.596 --> 10:00.559
The whole day I was chasing fun, and we were already having it.

10:00.642 --> 10:02.978
I learned how to have fun!

10:03.061 --> 10:06.148
Let's somersault in joy!

10:10.569 --> 10:13.155
Emma. Looks like I have to go home now.

10:13.238 --> 10:15.449
Okay, but you have to come back soon.

10:15.532 --> 10:17.784
Seriously. Like, tomorrow.

10:17.868 --> 10:20.787
Why? Do you need me to deliver something else?

10:20.871 --> 10:23.707
No! Because we're friends now.

10:24.458 --> 10:26.502
Emma, what is this?

10:26.585 --> 10:30.964
It's a hug, silly. It's how we show each other we care.

10:31.048 --> 10:32.841
Wow. Thanks, Emma.

10:33.383 --> 10:36.929
I'll come back to Mega City real soon. I promise.

10:38.013 --> 10:43.435
Wait, you have a jet pack? How could you not tell me you had a jet pack?

10:43.519 --> 10:45.812
We're totally playing with that next time!

10:50.025 --> 10:51.360
Doug, you're back.

10:51.443 --> 10:52.986
Sorry I took so long,

10:53.070 --> 10:56.657
but after I made the delivery, I made a friend.

10:56.740 --> 11:00.827
She told me that people play games like table tennis to have fun.

11:01.370 --> 11:03.080
Son, that's fantastic.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.123
This is to show how proud we are of you

11:05.207 --> 11:08.001
for making your very first Rebots delivery.

11:08.085 --> 11:10.295
And that we love you.

11:10.379 --> 11:13.757
Wow, thanks. But I learned a new way.

11:15.050 --> 11:16.218
Well.

11:17.678 --> 11:18.637
It's called a hug.

11:22.349 --> 11:23.517
Like this?

11:23.600 --> 11:25.102
This works too.

11:25.185 --> 11:28.689
Certainly does, Bob Bot. It certainly does.

11:32.109 --> 11:35.863
Barrel roll! Loop the loop!

11:37.739 --> 11:40.242
Hey, humans, what are you handing out?

11:40.325 --> 11:41.493
An item for rebooting?

11:41.785 --> 11:46.540
Actually, we're looking for volunteers to help fix up this old library.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.584
I'll let you know if I find any.

11:49.501 --> 11:50.711
Great.

11:53.422 --> 11:55.465
Hey, Dad. I have a delivery for you.

11:56.675 --> 11:58.927
More rebooted items. Thank you, son.

11:59.011 --> 12:01.471
You see, I'm sorting these items onto these shelves.

12:01.555 --> 12:03.807
That way, we'll know where to find them later.

12:03.891 --> 12:07.728
Okay, let's see. Clothes go on this shelf, toys on that shelf.

12:07.811 --> 12:11.064
Sports equipment over here. We've got a lot of umbrellas for some reason.

12:11.148 --> 12:13.108
Dad, I'm your son, not a reboot.

12:14.193 --> 12:19.156
Well, oops. Sorry, Doug. I was sort of in the sorting zone.

12:19.489 --> 12:21.825
Sweet sorting, Bob Bot.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.327
Thank you, Jenny.

12:23.410 --> 12:27.497
Hey, speaking of finding things, I ran into a couple of humans in the city

12:27.581 --> 12:30.709
who are looking for something called a volunteer.

12:31.585 --> 12:33.003
Volunteer.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.756
I've never heard of a volunteer before.

12:35.839 --> 12:38.133
Time to plug in and find out what it means.

12:40.385 --> 12:41.637
One, two, three, four

12:41.720 --> 12:43.472
Get up, get up Everyone's here

12:43.555 --> 12:45.599
We're gonna make a difference And volunteer

12:45.682 --> 12:47.851
We can give our time And a helping hand

12:47.935 --> 12:49.394
To aid a cause in need

12:49.478 --> 12:50.312
Yeah

12:50.395 --> 12:53.607
All it takes is a good idea And a little energy

12:53.690 --> 12:54.566
Hey, hey

12:54.650 --> 12:56.443
We could clean up at the beach

12:56.527 --> 12:58.237
Or find toys to donate

12:59.154 --> 13:00.906
Plant a public garden

13:00.989 --> 13:03.367
Help make the world a better place

13:03.450 --> 13:04.409
Hey, hey, hey

13:04.493 --> 13:06.495
-Get up, get up, everyone's here -Hey

13:06.578 --> 13:08.413
We're gonna make a difference And volunteer

13:08.497 --> 13:10.999
-Gonna get up, get up, everyone's here -Hey

13:11.083 --> 13:13.085
We're gonna make a difference And volunteer

13:13.919 --> 13:18.841
Wow, I'm in. I'll be a volunteer and help fix up the library.

13:18.924 --> 13:21.510
Only, I have a big question.

13:21.593 --> 13:23.220
I wonder how I can help.

13:23.303 --> 13:26.515
Well, if you want to find out, you better get going, son.

13:26.598 --> 13:29.309
This says right here the volunteer project starts soon.

13:29.393 --> 13:32.271
All right! I can't wait to start helping.

13:32.354 --> 13:33.355
Here I go.

13:35.858 --> 13:38.777
Hey, Doug. What are you doing at the library?

13:38.861 --> 13:41.572
Hi, Emma. I'm here to volunteer.

13:41.655 --> 13:43.782
Really? Me, too!

13:43.866 --> 13:46.743
Well, that and to find a book about elephants.

13:48.453 --> 13:52.040
I love books so much. I'd do anything to help them.

13:52.374 --> 13:55.294
Great. Only, how can we help, Emma?

13:55.919 --> 13:59.339
Doug. I know if we put our incredible-ness together,

13:59.423 --> 14:02.342
you and I can find a way to really help this library.

14:02.759 --> 14:04.469
Let's get volunteering.

14:09.224 --> 14:12.019
Yikes, this place is in bad shape.

14:12.102 --> 14:13.854
It's gonna need a full reboot.

14:14.229 --> 14:15.856
Hello!

14:15.939 --> 14:17.524
Are you kids here to volunteer?

14:17.608 --> 14:19.026
-We sure are. -Yeah.

14:19.276 --> 14:21.069
Jenny told me you needed some help.

14:21.153 --> 14:23.614
Well, super-duper. Follow us.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.325
Voilà.

14:26.408 --> 14:30.078
This model shows how the library will look once it's all fixed up.

14:31.914 --> 14:34.791
I can't wait for the library to be finished!

14:34.875 --> 14:39.087
Then I can grab a book and head straight for a nook, like so.

14:40.172 --> 14:42.466
Here's my book, and here's me in my nook.

14:42.549 --> 14:45.302
And here's me in my nook with my book. Delightful.

14:46.803 --> 14:48.555
That might not be for a while.

14:48.639 --> 14:51.391
It's gonna take a lot of work to fix this old place up.

14:51.475 --> 14:53.477
Then we better get started.

14:54.561 --> 14:57.606
Okay, Doug, let's find a way we can help.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.694
Emma, what's on the ground?

15:03.570 --> 15:04.613
I think it's...

15:05.822 --> 15:07.115
Jelly?

15:07.991 --> 15:11.912
Grape jelly, to be exact. We painted the whole room with it.

15:12.871 --> 15:14.414
Why would you do that?

15:14.498 --> 15:16.500
'Cause we thought it was purple paint.

15:16.583 --> 15:17.960
Classic.

15:18.043 --> 15:20.128
And now we can't get it off.

15:20.212 --> 15:22.464
Jelly is not easy to clean, kids.

15:23.382 --> 15:27.010
You know what, Doug? It may be gross, it may be sticky,

15:27.094 --> 15:28.971
it may go well with peanut butter,

15:29.054 --> 15:33.016
but if we're looking for a way to help, cleaning this jelly could be it.

15:33.767 --> 15:34.810
Let's scrub.

15:47.531 --> 15:51.201
Why does jelly have to be so sticky?

15:51.285 --> 15:52.828
Maybe we should work together.

15:55.581 --> 15:56.957
I think it's working, Emma.

15:58.625 --> 15:59.710
That's it?

16:00.169 --> 16:04.590
Let's face it, Doug. It would take an expert cleaner to scrub this place.

16:04.965 --> 16:06.633
Wait a nanosecond.

16:06.717 --> 16:09.178
I know an expert cleaner, Mop Bot.

16:09.261 --> 16:11.096
Maybe we could ask him to help.

16:11.930 --> 16:14.433
Hi, Dad. Still sorting?

16:14.933 --> 16:18.478
Yup, it's gonna be a while.

16:18.854 --> 16:20.397
So, what's up, son?

16:20.480 --> 16:23.400
Well, we were wondering if we could talk to Mop Bot.

16:23.483 --> 16:26.403
Emma and I are kind of in a jelly jam.

16:27.154 --> 16:28.989
Sounds delicious. I'll go get him.

16:29.698 --> 16:32.618
-Hi, Mr. Mop Bot. -Hey, kids. How are you?

16:32.701 --> 16:35.412
Would you mind helping clean up a mess at the library?

16:35.495 --> 16:37.539
As you can see, it's pretty gross.

16:38.332 --> 16:40.459
Great galloping goop!

16:40.542 --> 16:42.586
A room covered in jelly!

16:43.462 --> 16:46.298
It's the mess I've always dreamed of cleaning!

16:46.381 --> 16:48.717
I'll be there on the scrub-a-dub...

16:48.800 --> 16:49.760
double.

16:50.469 --> 16:55.641
Scanning. Survey says, what a mess!

16:57.142 --> 16:59.603
Wow, Mop Bot's a clean machine.

17:01.021 --> 17:02.231
Literally.

17:02.314 --> 17:04.942
Yeah, he's scrubbing all the jelly up.

17:05.025 --> 17:08.153
I guess cleaning is his way to help, not ours.

17:08.237 --> 17:10.948
Yeah, but don't worry, Doug.

17:11.031 --> 17:14.492
There has to be some other way we can help fix up the library.

17:14.910 --> 17:15.911
Come on.

17:18.329 --> 17:23.710
Hey, these empty bookshelves are supposed to be full of library books.

17:23.794 --> 17:25.587
So, where are the books?

17:26.547 --> 17:30.759
Doug. So much to read!

17:31.677 --> 17:33.971
What could they all be about?

17:34.263 --> 17:36.682
I don't know about all the books, Doug,

17:36.765 --> 17:41.103
but I will find one about elephants... somehow.

17:41.728 --> 17:45.691
Well, wouldn't it be easier to find if all the books were sorted?

17:46.608 --> 17:50.863
You brilliant bot! That's how we can help fix up the library.

17:50.946 --> 17:55.409
We'll sort all the books onto the shelves by color.

18:03.041 --> 18:06.920
There! The blue books are together, the yellow books are together,

18:07.004 --> 18:09.006
the red, the green.

18:09.423 --> 18:12.426
Perfect. So what color is the book about elephants, Emma?

18:12.509 --> 18:14.511
Probably gray like an elephant.

18:15.429 --> 18:18.932
Nope, this one's about frogs, and frogs are green.

18:19.391 --> 18:22.269
Maybe color isn't the best way to sort books.

18:22.352 --> 18:24.563
Well, what about... size?

18:32.738 --> 18:36.325
Okay, now the big books are at one end,

18:36.408 --> 18:38.535
all the way to the small ones at the other.

18:39.161 --> 18:40.662
Great work, Doug.

18:41.121 --> 18:45.792
So if elephants are big, then this big book should be about elephants.

18:46.335 --> 18:49.004
But it's not. It's about ants?

18:50.672 --> 18:52.883
Emma, I think we could use some help.

18:53.717 --> 18:55.636
And I know just who to ask.

18:57.137 --> 18:59.973
Hey, Dad. Are you finished sorting the warehouse yet?

19:01.183 --> 19:02.392
Not quite, son.

19:03.268 --> 19:06.730
I was gonna ask for your help sorting the books here at the library.

19:06.813 --> 19:09.942
-But if you're still busy-- -No, no, no. Happy to help.

19:10.817 --> 19:14.446
I'm pretty sure this job will be here when I get back.

19:15.531 --> 19:20.160
Okay, so you need these books sorted so you can find the ones you want.

19:20.244 --> 19:22.955
-Yeah. -But how do we do it, Mr. Bot?

19:23.038 --> 19:26.708
We sort them by subject. I'll show you.

19:27.292 --> 19:29.878
Travel books go on this shelf. Mysteries here.

19:29.962 --> 19:32.923
Picture books here. Robotics.

19:33.006 --> 19:34.675
Animal books go on this shelf.

19:34.758 --> 19:36.677
Of course! Look, Doug.

19:36.760 --> 19:41.598
With the animal books all together, I easily found this one about elephants.

19:42.224 --> 19:44.560
Hello, wonderful.

19:45.978 --> 19:49.273
-Wow, Dad's sure helping the library. -There we go!

19:49.356 --> 19:52.651
-Almost done. -Only, how can we help, Emma?

19:52.943 --> 19:54.278
Not sure, Doug.

19:54.361 --> 19:56.989
Guess we just gotta find the right job for us.

20:30.564 --> 20:33.650
Doug. Doug, Doug, Doug. Look.

20:34.026 --> 20:36.486
The library's all fixed up now.

20:36.570 --> 20:38.447
There's nothing left for us to do.

20:39.114 --> 20:44.411
Hi, volunteers. We wanna thank you all so much for volunteering today.

20:44.494 --> 20:46.914
And we'd like to thank you for organizing.

20:46.997 --> 20:47.998
Let's hear it for them.

20:48.081 --> 20:49.458
Thank you, gals.

20:49.541 --> 20:52.628
Oh, no. The volunteering's finished.

20:52.711 --> 20:54.004
And we didn't help.

20:54.087 --> 20:57.591
And now we'd like you to give a big round of applause

20:57.674 --> 21:02.012
to the two extra-special volunteers who made this all possible.

21:02.304 --> 21:04.389
Doug and Emma!

21:04.973 --> 21:06.183
What?

21:07.851 --> 21:09.478
But we didn't do anything.

21:09.561 --> 21:12.314
All we did was ask for help from our friends and family.

21:12.397 --> 21:14.650
Yeah, they did the things we couldn't.

21:14.733 --> 21:15.776
Exactly.

21:15.859 --> 21:17.528
That's the heart of volunteering.

21:17.611 --> 21:20.781
By asking for help, you brought everyone together.

21:22.157 --> 21:23.367
I see.

21:23.450 --> 21:26.286
So we called in Mop Bot, and he cleaned the place.

21:26.870 --> 21:28.413
It was a pleasure.

21:28.497 --> 21:31.917
And we called in my dad, and he sorted all the books.

21:33.126 --> 21:34.169
Good times.

21:34.253 --> 21:37.005
And your mom fixed the library card machine.

21:37.089 --> 21:40.342
And my dad and Princess Woofingham planted the trees.

21:42.261 --> 21:46.849
Doug, the library is all fixed because we got everyone to pitch in.

21:50.477 --> 21:53.939
I learned a way I could help. By asking others to help.

21:54.314 --> 21:57.568
We brought them together, and they fixed up the library.

21:57.651 --> 22:01.238
Great work, son. But now that the library's finished,

22:01.321 --> 22:04.241
I guess it's time to get back to sorting all those reboots.

22:04.324 --> 22:07.619
It's such a big project, I don't know how I'm gonna finish.

22:07.703 --> 22:10.247
Wait a nanosecond! I have an idea.

22:11.456 --> 22:14.459
Hey, Dad. Here are more rebooted items to sort.

22:14.543 --> 22:15.711
Thanks, son.

22:15.794 --> 22:17.921
And thank all you volunteers.

22:18.005 --> 22:21.508
With everyone working together, the sorting is almost finished.

22:21.592 --> 22:25.512
Sometimes when you need help, you just have to ask for it.

22:25.596 --> 22:27.931
Very true, son. Very true.

22:28.015 --> 22:31.560
And now it's time to wrap this project up.

22:31.643 --> 22:34.479
-All right! -Yeah!

22:37.107 --> 22:38.108
Hey

22:44.323 --> 22:45.199
Hey, hey, hey

22:50.204 --> 22:51.205
Hey

22:53.040 --> 22:53.916
Hey, hey, hey

22:53.999 --> 22:55.459
Get up, get up Everyone's here

22:55.542 --> 22:57.878
We're gonna make a difference And volunteer

22:57.961 --> 23:00.088
Gonna get up, get up Everyone's here

23:00.172 --> 23:02.382
We're gonna make a difference And volunteer
