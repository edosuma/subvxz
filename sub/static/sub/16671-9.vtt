that's trying to come out.

Pablo, you're our only hope

Yes, I'm upset.
Yes, I'm behind the wheel.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.326
Yes, I'm drunk.

isn't the fancy kind from the DMV,

04:17.880 --> 04:19.041
but at least I'm drunk!

04:19.200 --> 04:21.089

- Boring.
- I'd like the explanation.

05:57.600 --> 06:00.126
Okay, look, if young me
never reads from that book,

06:00.280 --> 06:03.124
then evil will not plague my life,
and Pablo will be alive again.

profound causality paradoxes.

young Ash can read from it.

got in the playoffs with a losing record.

13:57.680 --> 13:59.250
Woman: Hello?

14:00.320 --> 14:02.084
Is somebody out there?

14:03.360 --> 14:04.771
Please!

14:04.920 --> 14:06.763
Help me!

14:07.720 --> 14:09.085
Please!

14:09.280 --> 14:10.884
I'm trapped!

14:24.240 --> 14:27.005
(creaks)

14:33.920 --> 14:35.365
Kelly: Incredible.

14:35.560 --> 14:36.971
We didn't even make it to the cabin

14:37.120 --> 14:40.044
before Ash's brilliant plan
freaked the toaster.

14:40.200 --> 14:43.124
You know once we destroy the book,
you don't have to follow him anymore.

14:43.280 --> 14:45.123
You can forge your own path.

14:45.320 --> 14:46.970
Who says I'm not already forging?

14:47.120 --> 14:49.168
I make my own choices, okay?

14:49.360 --> 14:52.569
I could forge the shit
out of my path, if I wanted to.

14:52.720 --> 14:54.165
- I don't doubt it.
- (twig snaps)

14:54.320 --> 14:57.847
Whoever's following us,
come out now,

14:58.040 --> 15:00.611
or I start spraying!

15:02.400 --> 15:04.084
Let's keep going, huh?

15:08.920 --> 15:10.922
(creaking)

15:20.120 --> 15:22.646
- (door creaks)
- (Ash gasps)

15:27.840 --> 15:29.842
(rattling)

15:30.000 --> 15:32.207
(metallic clanging)

16:00.120 --> 16:03.124
- (metal clinking)
- (woman sobbing)

16:03.280 --> 16:05.567
Who's there?

16:06.880 --> 16:10.566
- Woman: Please. Help.
- Who is that?

16:10.720 --> 16:12.290
Woman: He's chained me up
and he won't let me go.

16:12.440 --> 16:14.568
Who chained you up?

16:14.720 --> 16:17.883
- I said who chained you up?
- My husband.

16:18.080 --> 16:20.651
He's going to kill me.

16:24.320 --> 16:26.800
Oh, Jesus! Henrietta.

16:29.360 --> 16:32.091
- How do I know you?
- We've met before.

16:32.240 --> 16:34.242
Uh, actually, not yet.
Not for you, anyway.

16:34.400 --> 16:35.845
Please let me go.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.447
My husband,
he's found some Book of the Dead.

16:39.640 --> 16:42.405
And I don't know,
it's changed him somehow.

16:42.600 --> 16:44.329
- Where's the book now?
- I have no idea.

16:44.520 --> 16:47.922
I'm chained to the damn wall!
I can help you find it.

16:48.080 --> 16:50.526
Please, let me go,
before he kills us both.

16:50.680 --> 16:52.762
There's a key there on the table.

16:55.040 --> 16:56.485
Please!

16:58.280 --> 16:59.691
How dare you.

16:59.840 --> 17:01.683
Hiding inside a little old lady.

17:01.840 --> 17:04.286
- (groans)
- You must take me for a grade-A chump!

17:04.440 --> 17:05.805
What are you doing?

17:06.000 --> 17:08.287
- (screams)
- Listen up, cupcake, I'm from the future.

17:08.440 --> 17:11.329
So all of your Deadite mumbo jumbo
isn't new to me.

17:11.480 --> 17:15.040
You can pop now, you can pop later,
I don't give a rat's ass.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.565
All I care about is that book,

17:16.760 --> 17:18.762
and you're going to tell me
where it is right now!

17:18.920 --> 17:21.890
Ow! Stop!
You're worse than my husband!

17:22.040 --> 17:23.121
- (shrieks)
- (laughs)

17:23.280 --> 17:25.521
I can do this all day, sugar lips.

17:27.079 --> 17:28.923
(car approaching)

17:30.680 --> 17:32.921
- It's him.
- (car doors close)

17:38.320 --> 17:40.129
(door opens)

17:41.640 --> 17:43.483
Man:
Welcome to my cabin in the woods.

17:43.640 --> 17:45.051
- It is.
- (door closes)

17:45.200 --> 17:46.486
Woman: It's really nice.

17:46.640 --> 17:49.007
Looks like he's got a hot
little number on the side, too.

17:49.160 --> 17:53.006
Good for him.
I mean, uh, men are such pigs.

17:53.160 --> 17:56.642
He's going to torture her,
just like he tortured me.

17:56.840 --> 18:00.322
Professor Knowby, I can't thank you
enough for the extra credit.

18:00.480 --> 18:03.450
(chuckles) You're a good student.
You deserve it.

18:04.760 --> 18:08.526
Now, your roommates aren't
going to be worried about you

18:08.680 --> 18:10.170
being away for the weekend?

18:10.320 --> 18:12.402
Oh, well, I live alone.

18:12.560 --> 18:16.326
I had a cat, but it just ran away
for absolutely no reason.

18:16.480 --> 18:18.801
So, it's really just me.

18:18.960 --> 18:20.769
More time to focus on your work.

18:22.680 --> 18:24.125
(gasps)

18:26.200 --> 18:27.645
It's just the wind.

18:30.040 --> 18:33.044
Now, before we start
these translations,

18:33.200 --> 18:36.249
there's just something
I need you to help me with.

18:37.040 --> 18:39.042
Please, there's no time.
The key!

18:39.200 --> 18:41.646
No. Not until I know
where that book is. Now spill.

18:41.800 --> 18:43.370
- Unlock me first.
- Not a chance.

18:43.520 --> 18:46.649
He always keeps it with him,
so the book is here now.

18:46.800 --> 18:49.531
Just let me go
and I'll show you!

18:49.680 --> 18:51.921
Please!
I'm not whatever you think I am!

18:52.080 --> 18:54.082
(cellar door opens)

18:54.240 --> 18:57.608
Please, don't let him
hurt me again.

18:57.760 --> 18:59.569
Professor Knowby:
Down here.

19:00.720 --> 19:02.848
Woman: Down there?

19:04.640 --> 19:06.290
Gosh, it's cold.

19:06.440 --> 19:09.887
You'll forgive the darkness
and the dirt.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.490
And the cobwebs.
(chuckles)

19:12.640 --> 19:15.211
Maybe we should
head back upstairs?

19:16.480 --> 19:19.006
Where there's more... light?

19:19.160 --> 19:22.004
Tanya, I'm sorry.

19:22.160 --> 19:24.208
I fear I may have deceived you.

19:25.760 --> 19:27.808
You're not really here
to help me translate.

19:28.760 --> 19:32.731
What do you mean, Professor?
Wh... why am I here?

19:32.880 --> 19:35.201
For something
much more important.

19:45.560 --> 19:46.925
What the fu...

19:47.120 --> 19:48.360
- Fuck!
- (gasps)

19:48.520 --> 19:51.330
- (Screaming)
" (gasps)

19:51.480 --> 19:53.528
Fuck!

19:53.680 --> 19:55.762
Oh, my dear, I'm so sorry.

19:55.960 --> 19:57.166
- (wailing)
- Does it hurt?

19:57.320 --> 19:58.606
Can I offer you some Ibuprofen?

19:58.800 --> 20:00.643
What?! Yes, it fucking hurts!

20:00.840 --> 20:02.205
- (shrieking)
- (metal creaking)

20:02.360 --> 20:04.203
Truly, I can't apologize enough.

20:04.360 --> 20:06.328
But this really is my only option.

20:06.480 --> 20:07.811
- (crunching)
- (screaming)

20:07.960 --> 20:10.440
Jesus... you were right.

20:10.640 --> 20:13.291
- Guy's a dick.
- And he's going to kill her, too.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.448
We need to stop him.

20:16.880 --> 20:19.360
Tanya:
Why are you doing this?!

20:19.520 --> 20:20.965
I have no choice.

20:21.120 --> 20:24.329
On my last expedition,
I found the Necronomicon.

20:24.480 --> 20:26.960
I became obsessed with its power.

20:27.160 --> 20:29.561
- (wailing)
- It called to me...

20:29.720 --> 20:31.210
overtook me.

20:31.360 --> 20:34.011
Please... he's a monster.

20:34.160 --> 20:37.482
So, I read from the book,
and summoned the Kandarian demon.

20:40.080 --> 20:42.447
It was magnificent.

20:43.560 --> 20:45.005
Unlike anything I've ever seen.

20:45.160 --> 20:46.650
(whispers)
Okay, I got this. Go hide.

20:46.800 --> 20:47.801
(whispers) Okay.

20:47.960 --> 20:51.123
Until it possessed my wife, Henrietta.

20:51.280 --> 20:52.930
That's why she's
chained up down here.

20:54.480 --> 20:56.323
You got to be kidding me.

20:58.680 --> 20:59.727
Nothing else worked.

20:59.880 --> 21:03.680
Maybe I can find a way to get
the demon out of her and into you.

21:03.840 --> 21:06.047
' (Tanya whimpering)
" (gasps)

21:06.240 --> 21:08.049
That lying old witch.

21:08.240 --> 21:10.527
- (Deadite Henrietta cackling)
- (Ash yelling)

21:11.360 --> 21:12.771
- (gasps)
- Oh, no.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.970
You brought us home a third.
How naughty of you!

21:22.320 --> 21:24.607
- (gasps)
- What?

21:24.800 --> 21:27.531
The book,
it's just been opened.

21:27.720 --> 21:30.041
(leaves rustling, creaking)

21:36.720 --> 21:38.484
(both grunting, yelling)

21:51.880 --> 21:54.565
I'm going to stomp you
a new mud hole to suck out your soul!

21:54.720 --> 21:56.324
I should've slapped you harder!

21:57.800 --> 21:59.564
(yells)

22:04.480 --> 22:05.561
Ruby, help!

22:05.760 --> 22:06.886
(choking)

22:10.560 --> 22:11.846
Ruby!

22:14.600 --> 22:16.284
Kelly!

22:19.440 --> 22:20.680
- (screaming)
- (Deadite Henrietta cackling)

22:20.840 --> 22:23.650
That chin of yours
is an easy target!

22:23.800 --> 22:25.962
Yeah?
Now it's my turn, jelly belly.

22:26.120 --> 22:27.121
(cackling continues)

22:34.280 --> 22:36.123
Help me!
Please! Please!

22:36.280 --> 22:38.328
Can you get me out of here?!
(panting)

22:40.720 --> 22:42.370
(screaming)

22:44.800 --> 22:47.963
Help! Let go!

22:57.960 --> 23:00.247
Stab it in its eye!

23:15.160 --> 23:17.970
The good news is
now I can add "Demonic Tree"

23:18.160 --> 23:20.640
to the list of things that have tried
to murder me since I met Ash.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.643
Could have been worse.
Let's go find him.

23:24.480 --> 23:27.882
- (shrieking)
- Okay! Hey, hey!

23:28.040 --> 23:30.486
Listen to me!
Shouting is not going to loosen the trap.

23:30.640 --> 23:33.086
- You got to stop!
- (panting)

23:35.240 --> 23:36.844
Okay, thank you.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.002
Now, looks like
you're stuck in there pretty good.

23:39.160 --> 23:42.846
Good news is if we have to amputate
to get you out, I'm your guy.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.641
(chuckles) It may not seem like it,
but this is your lucky day.

23:46.800 --> 23:49.929
My name is Ash Williams.
I'm a hero from the future.

23:50.080 --> 23:52.287
I'm here to save the world
from evil... again.

23:52.440 --> 23:54.522

23:56.200 --> 23:57.201
- (ripping)
- (grunting)

23:57.360 --> 23:59.886
I'm Tanya.
I'm a student from Wisconsin.

24:00.080 --> 24:01.844
I was here to help the professor
with his book.

24:02.040 --> 24:03.724
- Stupid Necronomicon!
- (screaming)

24:03.920 --> 24:06.082
- Jeez, I'm sorry.
- (yells)

24:06.240 --> 24:09.050
That thing has been a festering boil
on my ass for most of my adult life.

24:09.200 --> 24:11.202
- (yelling continues)
- But it ends today.

24:11.360 --> 24:13.362
- Believe that.
- (screaming)

24:13.520 --> 24:15.522

24:21.880 --> 24:24.884
- (stammering)
- (groaning)

24:25.040 --> 24:26.280
Yep, working on it.

24:27.400 --> 24:30.404
Give me a break, I got one hand!
Jesus!

24:30.560 --> 24:32.050
(stomping)

24:32.240 --> 24:34.846
(yelling)

24:37.640 --> 24:39.927
- Ash, stop!
- I can't!

24:40.120 --> 24:41.804
(mocking)
I can't!

24:45.360 --> 24:47.044
Let go!

24:47.200 --> 24:49.089
I'm stuck!

24:49.240 --> 24:50.605
(mocking)
I'm stuck!

24:56.040 --> 24:58.008
Tanya, stop the Professor!

24:58.160 --> 25:00.003
Don't let him take that book!

25:00.160 --> 25:02.561
Bye-bye, dear.

25:02.720 --> 25:04.927
- (buzzing)
- Let's have some fun!

25:05.080 --> 25:06.525
Why wait?

Professor, please!

25:25.680 --> 25:27.682
- I'm sorry, Tanya.
- Please!

25:27.840 --> 25:30.320
I'm not normally like this,
I swear!

Oh, you're a fucking asshole!

this goddamn door!
