Nice Christmas tree!

My bad! Next time I'll let
you put the star on top.

Point is, I'm stuck here.

00:45.746 --> 00:47.546
I even had to ditch Aunt May.

I've never spent the holidays

only come once a year,

stay out of this room.

There is more to the moon

Whoa, buddy. And here I thought
a tree trying to bite me

04:14.007 --> 04:16.255
Well, looks like you're
stuck here for a while.

04:16.257 --> 04:19.925
Which is fine with me, because it
was getting a little lonely all by myself.

04:21.494 --> 04:23.028
Isn't there someone
who's going to miss you?

04:23.030 --> 04:25.164
Not really.
I'm an orphan.

04:25.166 --> 04:27.166
I live in a home
a few blocks from here.

04:27.168 --> 04:29.234
The truth is,
I didn't want to be stuck

04:29.236 --> 04:31.403
in that rotten place for the
holidays, (MUFFLED CRYING)

04:31.405 --> 04:33.005

to find somewhere

04:33.007 --> 04:34.873
I could enjoy
this time of year again.

You've got no family anywhere?

04:40.347 --> 04:43.248

and I spent every holiday

04:43.250 --> 04:45.284
at his old farmhouse
in the country.

04:45.286 --> 04:49.096
But those times are gone
now, and so is my dad.

Look, it's the holidays,

05:01.969 --> 05:04.803
and I know this place isn't exactly
brimming with holiday cheer,

05:04.805 --> 05:07.473
but let's see what we can do.

05:07.475 --> 05:10.275
Spidey-Claus on the case!

05:10.277 --> 05:12.144
Uh, this is an old

- Back at you, Spidey.

Loony-Moony's gone yet,

05:35.936 --> 05:37.970
so we can
get you back home.

05:37.972 --> 05:39.304

05:39.306 --> 05:41.340
Whoa! That room's
off-limits.

- Doctor's orders. Sorry.
- Oh, come on, Spidey.

05:44.245 --> 05:46.979
No, no, no, no, no.
I made a solemn promise

05:46.981 --> 05:49.281
to stay out of that room,
and I'm going to honor it.

05:49.283 --> 05:52.417
True, I've broken that promise
once, but just that one time.

05:52.419 --> 05:54.153
Not again. Ah!

05:54.155 --> 05:56.755
Oh, come on! Whoa!

06:11.338 --> 06:13.338
<i>See what I did there?
"Disappeared"?</i>

06:13.340 --> 06:17.342
The helmet turned his cheap

was on the Brooklyn Bridge.</i>

06:21.314 --> 06:22.548

06:33.326 --> 06:36.795
<i>One minute we were fighting,
and then</i> he was just gone.

06:36.797 --> 06:39.364
I recovered his helmet
and gave it to Dr. Strange.

06:39.366 --> 06:41.200
I don't know why
he still has it.

06:41.202 --> 06:42.367
He should have
destroyed this thing.

10:35.935 --> 10:38.637
(GROWLING)
See? Giant gingerbread men.

10:38.639 --> 10:42.516
Hilarious. Although, this is
actually kind of terrifying.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.377
Careful! That was probably

10:45.379 --> 10:48.180
the mystical table of
Whoodoo-voodoo-ton or something.

10:49.615 --> 10:50.577
(GRUNTS)

10:50.578 --> 10:51.616
Oh, boy.

10:51.618 --> 10:54.486
I could really use some of that Dr.
Strange wisdom right now.

10:54.488 --> 10:57.389
Think, Spidey.
What did Strange teach you?

10:57.391 --> 11:00.792
Spider-Man, put that down.
That's not a toy.

11:00.894 --> 11:02.260
No, that's not applicable.

11:02.262 --> 11:05.830
Spider-Man, wear a hat.
It's cold outside.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.832
Great advice,
but not the time.

11:07.834 --> 11:09.334
What was that other thing?

11:09.336 --> 11:13.838
Remember, sometimes the enemy
of my enemy is my friend.

11:14.674 --> 11:15.941
(GRUNTING)

11:15.943 --> 11:18.777
He can't really
make things worse, right?

11:19.378 --> 11:20.912
<i>Folsum Vishti!</i>

11:21.014 --> 11:22.847
(LAUGHS) Nailed it that time!

11:23.683 --> 11:25.350
(GRUNTS)

11:25.352 --> 11:27.686
Prepare for your end,
sugary beasts!

11:27.688 --> 11:30.021
(GRUNTING)
(GROWLING)

11:31.857 --> 11:33.358
Thanks, Moon Knight.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.908
(GRUNTING)

11:34.909 --> 11:37.462
I am only doing the moon's will.

11:37.464 --> 11:38.957
Of course you are.

11:39.733 --> 11:40.699
Look, Francie...

11:40.701 --> 11:42.901
My name is Frances Beck!

11:42.903 --> 11:44.803
I'm sorry I called
your dad a loser.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.905
I'm not the bad guy here.
(GRUNTS)

11:46.907 --> 11:49.207
Don't you remember the fun
we had, like a minute ago?

11:49.209 --> 11:50.842
You thought I was
someone else, but...

11:50.844 --> 11:52.677
(SCREAMING)

11:52.679 --> 11:55.013
Whoa, whoa. Hey,
what's going on in there?

11:55.015 --> 11:57.449
- Are you okay?
- Get away from me!

12:03.856 --> 12:07.759
Yes, run, foul night-spawn.

12:07.761 --> 12:09.861
All bend to the might
of the moon,

12:09.863 --> 12:12.864
who powers
the very tides of the sea.

12:12.866 --> 12:16.034
Dr. Strange is starting
to sound downright logical.

12:16.036 --> 12:18.269
Okay, since you were trying
to ambush this girl outside,

12:18.271 --> 12:21.506
I'm guessing you, or the
moon, saw all this coming?

12:21.508 --> 12:22.493
Did you have a plan?

12:22.494 --> 12:25.744
Why would I reveal my plan
to such as you, when...

12:25.746 --> 12:28.079
(WIND BLOWING)
Huh?

12:28.081 --> 12:29.308
What was that, Master?

12:29.309 --> 12:29.881
(WIND CONTINUES BLOWING)

12:29.883 --> 12:32.584
Yes, if it is your will.

12:32.586 --> 12:34.119
What did the moon say?

12:34.121 --> 12:36.921
Believe it or not, first time
I've ever asked that question.

12:36.923 --> 12:40.358
Very well. I will reveal all.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.193
The moon warned me
that a young girl would seek

12:42.195 --> 12:45.196
to reawaken a dormant evil
trapped in this place,

12:45.198 --> 12:47.298
and that, should she obtain
the power of the helmet,

12:47.300 --> 12:49.534
there was only one way
to stop her.

12:49.536 --> 12:51.236
Ooh, let me guess.
MoonPies?

12:51.238 --> 12:53.772
Am I right? Right?
No? No?

12:53.774 --> 12:55.273
Don't be ridiculous.

12:55.275 --> 12:58.276
Right. Wouldn't want anything
ridiculous to happen tonight.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.879
She can be stopped with
a certain mystical wand.

13:00.881 --> 13:03.782
The wand is capable of consuming
the power of the helmet,

13:03.784 --> 13:06.618
collapsing it upon itself,
obliterating it.

13:06.620 --> 13:09.821
Wand, you say?
I think we might be in luck.

13:13.559 --> 13:15.226
Okay, for real,

13:15.228 --> 13:18.273
this is the last time I violate my
promise not to enter this room.

13:18.765 --> 13:20.682
Really. Last time.

13:23.335 --> 13:27.438
Yes, this is the very wand the
moon has shown me in a vision.

13:27.440 --> 13:31.342
Look, I know a girl who can speak
to squirrels, but your moon power?

13:31.344 --> 13:33.845
It's one of the most preposterous
things I've ever heard.

13:33.847 --> 13:38.082
How does that work? I am a mere
specter, the avatar of the moon.

13:38.084 --> 13:40.952
The lunar satellite shares
its secrets with me,

13:40.954 --> 13:42.954
and I do its bidding
in confidence.

13:42.956 --> 13:46.357
I actually know less than
I did before I asked.

13:46.359 --> 13:50.028
Hey, Moonie, this wand thing
just destroys the helmet, right?

13:50.030 --> 13:51.629
Not the person wearing it?

13:51.631 --> 13:54.332
The moon will have
its vengeance.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.967
Not sure
that's an answer.

13:55.969 --> 13:58.203
'Cause if it will
destroy Francie, too,

13:58.205 --> 14:00.004
that's not how I roll.

14:00.006 --> 14:01.940
If that's your endgame,
I don't need your help.

14:05.211 --> 14:09.013
This city will
fear the name Mysterio!

14:12.284 --> 14:13.852
(ROARING)

14:13.854 --> 14:15.854
Okay. I need your help.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.356
(ROARING)

14:18.358 --> 14:20.058
Don't suppose the moon's
got any ideas

14:20.060 --> 14:23.027
about stopping imaginary snow
monsters that turned real?

14:23.029 --> 14:25.129
Yes, Master.
As your lunar avatar,

14:25.131 --> 14:28.733
it is my solemn duty to defend
this city and subdue the villain,

14:28.735 --> 14:30.969
but this Spider avatar
only slows me down.

14:30.971 --> 14:32.904
If you're going
to make snarky asides,

14:32.906 --> 14:35.139
you should make sure someone's
there to hear you first.

14:35.141 --> 14:36.042
Take it from me.

14:36.043 --> 14:37.566
- (ROARING)
- Huh?

14:42.414 --> 14:44.048
Whoa!

14:44.050 --> 14:45.283
(GRUNTS)

14:46.352 --> 14:48.720
So, reflexes...
Not a thing you have?

14:48.722 --> 14:51.022
I'd rather take the hit
than waste time blocking it.

14:51.024 --> 14:53.992
That's ridiculous. But,
admittedly, kind of impressive.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.927
The moon does not seek
to impress.

14:58.764 --> 15:00.865
There is no escape
from my power.

15:00.867 --> 15:03.935
Francie, stop! If you wanna
restore your dad's name,

15:03.937 --> 15:05.789
this is not
the way to do it!

15:07.373 --> 15:08.969
Ho, ho, ho!

15:08.970 --> 15:09.908
(GRUNTS)

15:09.910 --> 15:12.377
But if you wanna give New York City
a lifetime of holiday nightmares,

15:12.379 --> 15:14.746
you're definitely
on the right track.

15:14.748 --> 15:17.348
(GRUNTING)
(ROARING)

15:18.851 --> 15:19.812
Whoa!

15:19.813 --> 15:21.176
(GRUNTS)

15:22.054 --> 15:23.121
(GROWLS)

15:23.923 --> 15:26.024
(GRUNTS)

15:26.026 --> 15:29.928
I've seen some really bad holiday
decorations, but those are the worst!

15:29.930 --> 15:33.631
These creations will destroy the city
if we don't stop them at the source.

15:33.633 --> 15:34.966
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
What?

15:37.870 --> 15:41.039
The moon demands we end this
by any means necessary.

15:43.742 --> 15:45.343
(GRUNTING)

15:46.578 --> 15:48.279
(GRUNTING)

15:48.281 --> 15:51.249
Yeah, I don't think we need the moon's
help to know we gotta stop these things.

15:58.324 --> 16:00.291
(ROARING)

16:00.293 --> 16:02.160
Hint taken!
I'm outta here!

16:12.438 --> 16:14.772
Moon Knight, wait!
Don't hurt her!

16:14.774 --> 16:16.174
(YELLS)

16:19.578 --> 16:22.747
It's only a matter of time now
while the spell takes effect.

16:22.749 --> 16:24.782
Using the wand
might destroy Francie.

16:24.784 --> 16:27.218
We have to try
to save her. Oh!

16:29.121 --> 16:30.688
(ROARING)

16:33.125 --> 16:35.827
What have we done?
I have to rescue her

16:35.829 --> 16:37.926
and somehow get Moon Knight
to help me.

16:38.631 --> 16:40.431
If only he'd listen to me
like he listens to...

16:40.433 --> 16:43.267
(BELL DINGS)
Wait. I have an idea.

16:43.269 --> 16:46.804
Uh, what's that?
I can hear you, Moon.

16:46.806 --> 16:50.208
Sure, I'll be your servant.
What is the moon's bidding?

16:50.210 --> 16:51.809
You can hear it too?

16:51.811 --> 16:54.178
What? Save the girl?

16:54.180 --> 16:56.114
- But how?
- Huh? (GRUNTS)

16:56.116 --> 16:59.183
Okay, I... I understand.
Yep. Yep. Makes total sense.

16:59.185 --> 17:02.720
Your will shall be mine.
By the moon, I swear it.

17:02.722 --> 17:04.122
What was
the moon's command?

17:04.124 --> 17:06.723
Moon says we have to do this
without hurting the girl.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.792
And who are we to argue
with a giant sky rock?

17:08.795 --> 17:11.194
I have learned to never
question the moon's judgment,

17:11.196 --> 17:13.564
however inexplicable
it might seem.

17:13.566 --> 17:16.534
We shall, together, be knights
of the moon this eve.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.169
Save her, but work quickly.

17:18.171 --> 17:20.872
I will hold off these
monsters as long as I can.

17:20.874 --> 17:23.574
May the moon be with you,
my friend.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.421
Also with you,
Mr. Knight.

17:27.546 --> 17:29.847
Okay, let's try this.
(GRUNTS)

17:29.849 --> 17:31.449
(YELLING)

17:35.154 --> 17:37.554
I'm inside the helmet?

17:38.091 --> 17:41.325
Wait. This must be the family
farmhouse Francie told me about.

17:43.228 --> 17:45.163
(LAUGHS) You...

17:45.165 --> 17:47.065
(LAUGHING) Pass the turkey.

17:48.167 --> 17:49.577
This does look nice.

17:50.170 --> 17:53.271
Francie doesn't seem
to realize it's all just...

17:53.273 --> 17:55.740
QUENTIN: Of course
I remember that, sweetie.

17:55.742 --> 17:59.243
You were always the best
daughter a father could ask for.

17:59.245 --> 18:01.379
Francie, this isn't real.

18:01.381 --> 18:03.748
It's the helmet's power,
and if we don't leave soon,

18:03.750 --> 18:07.418
it's gonna destroy you, me,
maybe even all of New York.

18:07.420 --> 18:10.021
This is real,
and this is my father.

18:10.023 --> 18:11.289
It's why I came here.

18:11.291 --> 18:14.459
You can't take him
away from me again.

18:14.461 --> 18:17.695
QUENTIN: Hey, Spider-Man,
is that you?

18:17.697 --> 18:20.364
It's been such a long time.

18:20.366 --> 18:23.267
Francie, I tried
to save your father.

18:23.269 --> 18:25.103
If he was really here,
he'd tell you...

18:25.105 --> 18:27.071
QUENTIN: That you offered me
your hand?

18:27.073 --> 18:29.273
Do you remember what
you told me that night?

18:29.275 --> 18:33.744
That I shouldn't throw away everything
just because of a few mistakes?

18:33.746 --> 18:38.149
Wait. How would an illusion know that?
Unless it really is...

18:38.151 --> 18:40.485
Me. I was at the end
that night.

18:40.487 --> 18:45.323
The selfishness that led me to create
the helmet only grew once I put it on.

18:45.325 --> 18:48.626
I didn't take your hand because
I knew it wouldn't help.

18:48.628 --> 18:52.897
I wasted the love of my family
pursuing petty desires.

18:52.899 --> 18:55.172
But my family
should have come first!

18:56.236 --> 18:59.103
Let me make up
for that mistake.

18:59.105 --> 19:01.339
Let me have this time
with my daughter.

19:01.341 --> 19:03.241
So Dr. Strange kept
the helmet

19:03.243 --> 19:05.977
because he knew you were
inside, bound by magic.

19:06.279 --> 19:08.946
I perfected hard-light
hologram technology,

19:08.948 --> 19:10.181
but I still wanted more.

19:10.183 --> 19:12.416
I struck a deal
with the demon Dormammu,

19:12.418 --> 19:15.753
so that when I used my helmet,
my holograms became real.

19:15.755 --> 19:18.956
I should have known Dormammu's
power would come at a heavy price,

19:18.958 --> 19:22.168
but I never dreamed I'd spend
my life in this prison.

19:22.462 --> 19:24.295
(THUDS)
(GASPS)

19:24.297 --> 19:27.893
Uh, I know we're in the midst
of a moment here, Mysterios...

19:28.101 --> 19:30.134
Wait. Mysterii?

19:30.136 --> 19:31.936
Either way,
we need to go now,

19:31.938 --> 19:34.539
before the harsh reality
blows us into who-knows-what.

19:34.541 --> 19:35.740
Wait! Dad!

19:36.775 --> 19:39.210
The real world
is no place for me.

19:39.212 --> 19:41.045
I can't go back.

19:41.047 --> 19:43.193
My soul is lost!

19:43.283 --> 19:44.782
Dad, no!

19:44.784 --> 19:47.285
I love you too much
to lose you again!

19:47.287 --> 19:51.189
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
You're better off without me.

19:51.191 --> 19:53.457
Quentin, you haven't
lost your soul.

19:53.459 --> 19:55.393
It's been back on Earth
the whole time.

19:55.395 --> 19:57.295
And she needs
her dad back.

19:57.297 --> 19:59.997
Maybe...
Maybe you're right.

19:59.999 --> 20:01.399
I'm sorry, Francie!

20:02.367 --> 20:03.734
(SCREAMING) No!

20:03.736 --> 20:05.703
(BOTH YELLING)

20:07.506 --> 20:09.473
Dad, how did you...

20:09.475 --> 20:12.743
Don't you forget who the
original Mysterio was, kiddo!

20:18.584 --> 20:20.651
I'm sorry, my master.

20:20.653 --> 20:23.254
Your avatar of the night
has failed.

20:23.256 --> 20:27.191
(ROARS)
(CREATURES GROWLING)

20:27.193 --> 20:28.292
(CRASHING)

20:31.230 --> 20:34.398
Dad! You're here!
You're really here!

20:34.400 --> 20:36.601
I was wrong.
We are victorious.

20:38.337 --> 20:41.204
Gee, M.K., you really
turned this place upside down.

20:41.708 --> 20:45.042
This is not the only edifice that
our mission has left damaged.

20:45.044 --> 20:46.577
Oh, no!

20:54.920 --> 20:57.855
Spider-Man!

21:03.061 --> 21:06.097
(LAUGHTER) MOON KNIGHT: Amusing.
Very amusing.

21:08.367 --> 21:09.700
Well, I guess it all worked
out in the end.

21:09.702 --> 21:11.469
MOON KNIGHT: From your
heavenly heights...

21:11.471 --> 21:13.571
We all learned... Huh? ...you
condescend to bless this blighted...

21:13.573 --> 21:15.973
Hey, who's doing
this wrap-up, me or you?

21:15.975 --> 21:17.541
(SCOFFS) You talking
to the moon again?

21:17.543 --> 21:20.044
Of course. Isn't that
who you're talking to?

21:20.046 --> 21:23.748
No. No one talks to the moon.
The moon doesn't talk.

21:23.750 --> 21:27.118
Well, if you are not talking to the
moon, then who are you talking to?
