00:08.000 --> 00:09.764
<i>Previously on</i> Agent Carter...

00:09.840 --> 00:12.571
As of this moment, Howard Stark
is a fugitive from justice.

00:12.640 --> 00:14.005
You're the only one
that can clear my name.

00:14.080 --> 00:16.447
- What's in the vial?
- Steve Rogers' blood.

00:17.960 --> 00:19.166
You lied to me.

00:19.240 --> 00:20.605
I knew how much Steve meant to you,

00:20.680 --> 00:22.170
because I know
how much he means to me.

00:22.240 --> 00:23.287
After seeing that kid in Russia,

00:23.360 --> 00:25.089
<i>I'd hate to tangle with one
that's all grown-up.</i>

00:26.560 --> 00:27.766
Focus. Please.

00:27.880 --> 00:30.486
Because we have something
very important to take care of.

00:30.560 --> 00:31.686
He got in my head.

00:31.800 --> 00:32.961
It's in the final stages.

00:33.040 --> 00:35.850
Promise me you'll get
the son of a bitch who did this.

00:37.680 --> 00:38.966
Chief!

00:44.120 --> 00:45.645
We need to find out what Ivchenko took.

00:45.720 --> 00:47.484
Item 17. It's gone.

00:47.560 --> 00:48.641
<i>What's that do?</i>

00:48.720 --> 00:49.960
<i>I have no idea.</i>

01:05.160 --> 01:07.606
Three out of four
famous Hollywood stars

01:07.680 --> 01:09.728
recommend Diamond toilet soap

01:09.840 --> 01:12.127
for high-quality complexion care.

01:12.200 --> 01:14.168
Be a Diamond girl.

01:15.400 --> 01:19.485
Only 39 cents for two bars.
And now back to our program.

01:20.280 --> 01:21.930
When we last left our hero,

01:22.000 --> 01:24.606
Captain America had saved
the 25th infantry,

01:24.680 --> 01:28.002
but his plane was going down
over the sea of Japan.

01:29.040 --> 01:31.646
Betty, I'm afraid this is the end.

01:31.720 --> 01:33.131
Oh, Cap,

01:33.200 --> 01:36.283
there will never be
another man like you.

01:36.360 --> 01:38.601
I love you, Captain America.

01:39.240 --> 01:42.608
But Betty Carver,
face wet with loving tears,

01:42.680 --> 01:44.364
hears only static.

01:52.920 --> 01:54.251
You're the SSR folks?

01:54.520 --> 01:56.204
What the hell happened here,
detective?

01:56.280 --> 01:59.841
Hell if I know. I got 47 dead,
heads bashed in, eyes gouged out,

01:59.920 --> 02:01.763
not a single survivor.

02:06.360 --> 02:07.361
Good Lord.

02:07.520 --> 02:09.363
It's like some kind of monster got in.

02:09.720 --> 02:10.800
Never seen anything like it.

02:10.880 --> 02:13.360
- All this happened inside the theater?
- This way.

02:30.360 --> 02:32.966
No monster killed these people.

02:34.160 --> 02:35.685
They killed each other.

02:41.960 --> 02:44.122
Guess you G-men catch stuff
like this all the time.

02:45.080 --> 02:46.650
No.

02:46.880 --> 02:48.484
No, we sure don't.

03:32.800 --> 03:35.007
Sousa! Sousa!

03:36.240 --> 03:38.607
Hey. Hey. What happened?

03:43.560 --> 03:44.686
Daniel!

03:47.160 --> 03:48.650
Get him off!

04:05.000 --> 04:07.480
This really is an amazing city.

04:08.680 --> 04:11.160
- It's like any other.
- No, no, my dear.

04:11.400 --> 04:15.803
This is a testimony
to American strength and ingenuity.

04:16.040 --> 04:17.041
Huh!

04:17.600 --> 04:21.923
It is a beacon for all the world to envy.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.287
And won't it be fun to tear it all down?

04:44.080 --> 04:46.731
Let us not bring
unwanted attention to ourselves.

04:54.560 --> 04:57.803
Good evening, Officer.
Did I do something wrong?

04:58.120 --> 04:59.485
Well, ma'am, there's a small matter

04:59.560 --> 05:01.050
of that traffic light
you missed back there.

05:01.120 --> 05:04.727
I did? Oh, my gosh!

05:04.800 --> 05:07.246
I am just the silliest goose.

05:07.320 --> 05:08.890
You're lucky
you didn't get in an accident.

05:08.960 --> 05:11.088
I am so sorry, Officer.

05:11.160 --> 05:14.130
You know, I would let
my grandfather drive, but...

05:14.200 --> 05:15.565
He's blind in one eye.

05:16.480 --> 05:18.164
Wartime injury.

05:20.680 --> 05:24.287
Okay, ma'am. Just be careful.
Get home safe.

05:24.360 --> 05:27.091
Thank you, Officer.
You are just the kindest man.

05:29.440 --> 05:31.841
<i>All cars,
be on the lookout for a vehicle last seen</i>

05:31.920 --> 05:34.002
<i>in the vicinity of 65th and Park.</i>

05:34.400 --> 05:37.847
<i>Black Dynaflow,
license Three-Yankee-Six-Zulu.</i>

05:37.920 --> 05:40.400
<i>Vehicle is reported stolen
by an armed female,</i>

05:40.480 --> 05:42.130
<i>blonde, 5'8".</i>

05:42.200 --> 05:45.522
<i>All patrolmen must proceed
with caution.</i>

06:05.440 --> 06:08.011
Carter, what the hell is going on?

06:08.360 --> 06:10.488
I was about to ask you the same thing.

06:10.560 --> 06:11.686
How are you feeling?

06:12.120 --> 06:13.849
Like I swallowed a bag of shrapnel.

06:15.960 --> 06:16.961
What's with this?

06:17.280 --> 06:18.486
Do you remember
anything that happened

06:18.560 --> 06:19.971
inside the movie theater?

06:20.600 --> 06:23.809
There was some kind of gas.

06:23.880 --> 06:28.044
You found the canister,
and you attacked Agent Thompson.

06:32.480 --> 06:33.970
I wanted to kill him.

06:34.760 --> 06:38.287
I wanted to kill everybody.

06:39.560 --> 06:41.562
Oh, God, Peggy.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.928
I hit you.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.411
I'm so sorry.

06:45.480 --> 06:48.484
You weren't yourself. How are you now?

06:49.800 --> 06:53.725
I still want to kill Thompson,
but no more than usual.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.082
Best the scientists can figure,

06:57.160 --> 07:00.164
it's a chemical that induces
psychosis upon exposure,

07:00.360 --> 07:01.646
which I can personally attest to

07:01.720 --> 07:04.166
after Sousa tried to bite my nose off.

07:04.880 --> 07:05.927
Hey, killer.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.049
I'm surprised Howard would consent
to manufacturing something like that.

07:09.120 --> 07:10.406
The amount that got me was tiny.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.084
How much of this stuff
does Ivchenko have?

07:12.200 --> 07:13.611
The lab counted 10 canisters.

07:14.320 --> 07:15.446
Meaning Ivchenko has enough

07:15.520 --> 07:17.727
to send half the city
into a homicidal rage.

07:17.800 --> 07:19.564
But why? Why go to all that trouble?

07:19.640 --> 07:21.404
'Cause he's a Russian jerk
with a chip on his shoulder.

07:21.480 --> 07:22.527
Why else?

07:22.600 --> 07:23.806
No, it's got to be
something more than that.

07:23.920 --> 07:26.571
Ivchenko has a plan.
He brought us into Russia.

07:26.640 --> 07:28.642
He tricked us into bringing him
into this country.

07:28.760 --> 07:30.922
There's something specific
that he is targeting.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.331
We just have to find out what it is.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.050
The target is me.

07:35.040 --> 07:36.724
- Hey!

07:36.800 --> 07:38.211
- Get your hands up.
- Get your hands up!

07:38.920 --> 07:39.967
Told you.

07:40.640 --> 07:43.450
- What kind of welcome is this?
- How the hell did you get in here?

07:43.520 --> 07:45.568
You know who designed
the SSR security system?

07:45.640 --> 07:47.449
Yeah, the same outfit
that secures the White House.

07:47.520 --> 07:51.809
Exactly. They stink.
You should have hired me.

07:53.840 --> 07:55.171
I know.

07:55.240 --> 07:56.287
You missed me.

08:00.800 --> 08:01.847
...than guilty.

08:01.960 --> 08:03.200
How about looking wrong?

08:03.280 --> 08:06.090
As of this moment,
you're under arrest, Stark.

08:07.520 --> 08:09.284
You know, I could help you with that.

08:11.280 --> 08:13.886
Roger Dooley is dead.

08:13.960 --> 08:16.042
Ray Krzeminski is dead.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.009
Along with a theater
full of innocent people.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.445
Stark Industries, that's all on you.

08:19.560 --> 08:20.686
You got something funny
to say about that?

08:20.760 --> 08:23.525
I know. That's why I came back.

08:24.600 --> 08:26.602
That's everything there is to know
about the Battle of Finow.

08:26.680 --> 08:29.081
I really don't care
about some old war story.

08:29.160 --> 08:30.286
Well, you should.

08:30.880 --> 08:33.008
'Cause all those deaths are on me, too.

08:33.440 --> 08:35.044
The gas is called Midnight Oil.

08:35.159 --> 08:36.730
You designed a poison gas, Howard?

08:36.799 --> 08:37.961
No!

08:38.960 --> 08:40.610
Well, not intentionally.

08:40.679 --> 08:41.885
The army wanted something

08:42.000 --> 08:44.287
that would keep soldiers awake
for days at a time,

08:45.000 --> 08:46.081
but it failed.

08:46.160 --> 08:48.242
Caused symptoms
similar to sleep deprivation,

08:48.320 --> 08:51.802
anger, hallucinations, psychosis.

08:51.880 --> 08:53.484
If you knew all that, why use it in Finow?

08:53.560 --> 08:56.291
I didn't. My lab was raided.

08:56.480 --> 08:58.642
They took my samples, my research,

08:58.720 --> 09:01.166
all on the orders of General McGinnis.

09:01.240 --> 09:02.969
The next day, they dropped it
on the Russians

09:03.040 --> 09:04.644
to help them take Finow.

09:04.960 --> 09:08.646
I flew there afterward
to see with my own eyes.

09:09.640 --> 09:11.722
What those men did to
each other, you can't imagine.

09:11.800 --> 09:13.404
We don't need to imagine.
We saw it in that theater.

09:13.480 --> 09:14.970
I experienced it myself.

09:15.040 --> 09:16.246
And you survived?

09:17.200 --> 09:19.043
It's been known to cause asphyxiation.

09:19.160 --> 09:20.400
Guess that explains my sore throat.

09:20.480 --> 09:22.164
It also explains our voiceless friends.

09:22.600 --> 09:25.410
Someone performed laryngotomy
procedures on these men.

09:25.480 --> 09:26.766
I expect it was Dr. Ivchenko

09:26.840 --> 09:30.287
or, as he's also known,
Johann Fennhoff.

09:30.360 --> 09:31.441
Who?

09:31.520 --> 09:34.364
A psychiatrist with
a specialty in hypnosis.

09:34.880 --> 09:36.291
Must be how they got to Dooley.

09:36.360 --> 09:38.362
And if he can control the chief,
we're all at risk.

09:38.440 --> 09:41.091
No. This time, I'm taking the risk.

09:41.440 --> 09:44.250
This Fennhoff
obviously wants to punish me,

09:44.320 --> 09:47.164
so let's give him what he wants.

09:47.240 --> 09:49.402
What are you talking about?

09:49.480 --> 09:50.720
I'll be the bait.

09:51.080 --> 09:52.969
The SSR just needs to set the trap.

09:53.040 --> 09:55.725
Yeah. Something public.

09:56.920 --> 09:59.446
- Real showy.
- Well, that's the only way I do it.

10:13.560 --> 10:15.688
Hey, this is private property.

10:18.760 --> 10:20.569
- I'll take care of it.

10:21.320 --> 10:23.846
Hey, mister.
Could you help me with something?

10:23.920 --> 10:25.684
<i>We interrupt this program</i>

10:25.760 --> 10:27.285
<i>to bring you a special news bulletin.</i>

10:27.360 --> 10:29.124
<i>Howard Stark returns a hero.</i>

10:29.200 --> 10:30.440
<i>The eccentric billionaire</i>

10:30.520 --> 10:32.045
<i>- and erstwhile absconder from justice</i>

10:32.120 --> 10:34.122
<i>- is in New York today to
announce a major breakthrough</i>

10:34.200 --> 10:36.282
<i>in the case of his missing technology.</i>

10:36.360 --> 10:38.522
<i>Mr. Stark will hold a press
conference this afternoon...</i>

10:39.680 --> 10:41.409
<i>...on the steps of City Hall
with all the details.</i>

10:43.920 --> 10:45.490
What are you waiting for?
Let's get in there.

10:45.560 --> 10:47.608
A new opportunity has arisen.

10:48.400 --> 10:49.890
Just since I left the car?

10:50.000 --> 10:52.241
We are going back to the city.

10:52.320 --> 10:54.641
Our plans have changed.

10:57.840 --> 10:59.410
How's that look?

10:59.480 --> 11:02.927
Like a nest of spiders
with very short legs.

11:03.680 --> 11:05.250
That's good enough.

11:05.760 --> 11:08.730
Hey, Peg, you got any powder?
I want to cut down the shine.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.168
I don't like this, Howard.
It's too dangerous.

11:11.240 --> 11:12.321
Don't waste your breath, Miss Carter.

11:12.440 --> 11:13.851
I've already wasted mine
on the subject.

11:13.920 --> 11:16.127
- What is that?
- It's body armor for your protection.

11:19.320 --> 11:20.401
It's junk.

11:21.760 --> 11:23.171
Where's my stuff?

11:25.600 --> 11:29.730
What are you people doing?
These are highly volatile materials.

11:30.600 --> 11:34.241
This... This is photosensitive.
This should be kept in the dark.

11:34.760 --> 11:37.240
This... This should be kept cool.

11:40.760 --> 11:41.761
And this.

11:45.640 --> 11:46.801
This is fine now.

11:46.880 --> 11:48.086
Howard, what are you hoping
to accomplish

11:48.160 --> 11:50.083
with this ridiculous press conference?

11:50.160 --> 11:51.924
There are other ways
to get Fennhoff into the open.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.764
Name one. No, name three.

11:54.680 --> 11:56.045
There it is.

11:57.480 --> 11:59.323
Stops a .50-cal round from 100 feet.

11:59.400 --> 12:01.528
Unless you're planning to put it
on your head, it won't be enough.

12:01.600 --> 12:02.761
I trust you to keep me safe.

12:02.840 --> 12:05.002
- You're punishing yourself.
- I'm redeeming myself.

12:05.120 --> 12:07.441
I have enough blood on my hands.
I don't need yours as well.

12:07.520 --> 12:09.602
I've had to go through my life not caring
what people think of me,

12:09.680 --> 12:10.920
but I do care what you think.

12:11.040 --> 12:12.849
And after everything you said
to me last time, I thought...

12:12.960 --> 12:14.849
Howard, I was angry.
That doesn't mean I want you to die.

12:14.960 --> 12:16.485
Well, that makes two of us.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.048
But you know and I know
that this is my fault.

12:20.600 --> 12:23.285
General McGinnis stole Midnight Oil
and used it recklessly.

12:23.360 --> 12:26.569
- He is at fault. Can you not see that?
- I need to fix this.

12:26.920 --> 12:29.002
Otherwise, I won't be able
to live with myself.

12:29.840 --> 12:31.046
You're mad.

12:31.880 --> 12:33.120
As a hatter.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.651
<i>After a thorough investigation,
we have concluded</i>

12:46.720 --> 12:49.451
<i>that Howard Stark is innocent</i>

12:49.800 --> 12:53.122
<i>of the theft and sale of weapons
to foreign enemies.</i>

12:53.360 --> 12:56.364
<i>All charges against Mr. Stark
have been dropped.</i>

12:57.320 --> 13:00.130
<i>We owe Mr. Stark
a tremendous debt of gratitude,</i>

13:00.200 --> 13:05.684
<i>and his assistance in our current
investigation is invaluable.</i>

13:05.840 --> 13:07.126
"Hero."

13:08.040 --> 13:09.371
"He is a hero."

13:12.360 --> 13:17.241
<i>He is a hero for all Americans.</i>

13:17.960 --> 13:19.644
Are the rooftops covered,
Agent Comden?

13:19.720 --> 13:21.882
<i>Mr. Stark will be working
in concert with the SSR...</i>

13:21.960 --> 13:25.043
<i>- All clear.</i>
- They're here somewhere. I know it.

13:25.720 --> 13:27.165
"Humbled by his genius."

13:27.240 --> 13:29.561
No. No. "Brilliance."
"Humbled by his brilliance."

13:31.320 --> 13:34.085
<i>We are humbled.</i>

13:34.840 --> 13:35.841
<i>Here's Howard Stark.</i>

13:35.960 --> 13:37.121
Mr. Stark, have all
your weapons been recovered?

13:37.200 --> 13:38.167
Is it true that you were hiding

13:38.240 --> 13:39.526
at the residence of Barbara Stanwyck?

13:39.600 --> 13:41.409
<i>For too long now,
the name Howard Stark</i>

13:41.760 --> 13:43.649
<i>has been dragged through the mud.</i>

13:43.760 --> 13:46.923
<i>Today is a day of reckoning
for anyone who doubts...</i>

13:47.000 --> 13:48.161
- Get down!

13:50.960 --> 13:53.611
- Who's got eyes on the shooter?
- It's coming from above.

13:54.760 --> 13:56.330
Get him out of here.
Police car in the back alley.

13:56.400 --> 13:57.447
- This way.
- Go!

14:01.920 --> 14:04.287
They're shooting from the hotel.

14:06.360 --> 14:09.603
- See? Told you it was a great idea.
- Your genius knows no bounds, sir.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.764
Take us to the SSR, officer.

14:18.360 --> 14:20.488
Oh, no.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.608
Listen, buddy, stop the car.

14:23.720 --> 14:25.643
Dr. Fennhoff would like to see you.

14:33.560 --> 14:35.449
- Agent!
- Where's Stark?

14:36.000 --> 14:37.240
He's been taken.

14:48.560 --> 14:50.324
Where are they?

14:52.240 --> 14:54.368
This rifle was rigged to fire itself.

14:54.840 --> 14:56.888
They're long gone.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.406
Strange.

15:01.760 --> 15:02.966
What's that?

15:03.240 --> 15:05.129
Either Dottie's a terrible shot,

15:05.200 --> 15:06.884
or this gun was never
supposed to kill Howard.

15:07.280 --> 15:09.408
It's aimed well above the podium.

15:09.480 --> 15:11.084
It was a diversion.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.126
Diversion from what?

15:13.200 --> 15:14.884
<i>All agents,
Stark's been grabbed.</i>

15:14.960 --> 15:18.009
<i>APB is being issued.
He's in a police car heading west.</i>

15:18.080 --> 15:19.081
Oh.

15:24.560 --> 15:27.040
Whatever Fennhoff is paying you,
I can double it.

15:28.440 --> 15:32.206
You like cars? You know, I like cars.

15:32.600 --> 15:34.682
You know, I got a fleet of Cadillacs.

15:34.760 --> 15:36.205
You can take your pick.

15:37.160 --> 15:38.650
Take two.

15:39.840 --> 15:42.810
All right. You see this piece of paper?

15:44.240 --> 15:49.087
It's Rosalind Russell's private number.
That is absolutely my final offer.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.284
So, now we got to tell
the whole world we're chumps.

15:51.360 --> 15:53.124
They've been planning this
whole thing since the beginning.

15:53.200 --> 15:54.247
No, they couldn't have. Could they?

15:54.320 --> 15:56.322
Kidnapping Howard couldn't have been
part of their original plan.

15:56.400 --> 15:58.084
They didn't know he was here
until the press conference.

15:58.160 --> 15:59.969
So if they don't want him dead,
what do they want?

16:00.040 --> 16:02.247
Howard said
Fennhoff wants to punish him.

16:02.320 --> 16:04.482
Whatever they've planned,
it must be a fate worse than death.

16:04.560 --> 16:06.210
We need to determine
what his next target is.

16:06.680 --> 16:08.170
The movie house was a test.

16:08.240 --> 16:10.368
So they got to be planning
something bigger.

16:10.920 --> 16:12.604
Statue of Liberty? Empire State?

16:18.120 --> 16:20.122
- What day is it?
- May 8th.

16:21.880 --> 16:23.769
- VE Day.
- They're going to hit Times Square.

16:41.760 --> 16:44.001
Car's near 42nd and 9th. No Stark.

16:44.080 --> 16:45.320
<i>42nd and 9th, copy.</i>

16:45.440 --> 16:46.566
This isn't good.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.729
No, it isn't.

17:02.120 --> 17:04.691
I know I should be afraid for my life,

17:04.760 --> 17:07.923
but there's just something
about you that puts me at ease.

17:09.079 --> 17:10.286
Must be those eyes.

17:11.040 --> 17:12.769
You don't remember me, do you?

17:13.520 --> 17:14.646
Should I?

17:14.960 --> 17:16.962
You and I spent
a nice weekend together

17:17.040 --> 17:18.644
not too long ago.

17:21.240 --> 17:22.810
Is it Alice?

17:25.960 --> 17:27.644
Guy at the coffee shop saw a blonde

17:27.720 --> 17:29.370
forcing a man
matching Stark's description

17:29.440 --> 17:31.522
into the back of a black sedan.

17:31.600 --> 17:33.523
They were last seen heading west
towards Lincoln Tunnel.

17:33.600 --> 17:35.364
I radioed their descriptions
to Port Authority,

17:35.440 --> 17:36.601
see if we can snag them at the tolls.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.284
They're trying to leave the city. Why?

17:38.360 --> 17:39.885
Maybe we were wrong about the target.

17:39.960 --> 17:41.121
Just talked to every
muckety-muck in the city,

17:41.200 --> 17:43.123
trying to call off the VE Day celebration.

17:43.200 --> 17:44.281
They won't do it.

17:44.360 --> 17:47.409
Already 100,000 people
packed into Times Square.

17:47.480 --> 17:48.891
We won't have enough time
to evacuate.

17:48.960 --> 17:50.610
He could have stashed
those canisters anywhere.

17:50.680 --> 17:52.125
The gas was designed
to be deployed by air.

17:52.200 --> 17:53.565
Which is why
we shut down all the airports.

17:53.640 --> 17:56.405
And every
private airfield in the area.

17:56.480 --> 17:58.448
I think I know
where Dr. Fennhoff is headed.

17:58.520 --> 17:59.851
Where?

18:01.120 --> 18:02.451
If his intention

18:02.560 --> 18:05.325
is to place blame for the attack
on Mr. Stark,

18:05.400 --> 18:08.244
would it not be most effective
to use one of Mr. Stark's own planes?

18:08.320 --> 18:09.845
He can't. We confiscated them all.

18:11.040 --> 18:12.963
Not all.

18:13.040 --> 18:14.041
Hmm?

18:14.120 --> 18:17.044
There is another vault.

18:17.120 --> 18:19.043
Considerably larger than the first.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.207
<i>Howard, I can't see a thing.</i>

18:25.840 --> 18:28.446
Howard!

18:28.520 --> 18:31.000
Is all this yours?

18:31.280 --> 18:32.486
Every one of 'em.

18:34.680 --> 18:35.681
You want to go for a ride?

18:37.080 --> 18:38.730
I think you've had
a few too many martinis

18:38.800 --> 18:39.881
to fly a plane.

18:39.960 --> 18:42.167
- You'll be perfectly safe.
- Hmm.

18:42.280 --> 18:43.611
Three of them fly themselves.

18:43.880 --> 18:46.201
I like a man with a vault full of toys.

18:46.280 --> 18:48.965
Well, you should see
what I got at home.

18:54.560 --> 18:55.721
Wait.

18:56.960 --> 18:58.803
Don't tell me.

18:59.440 --> 19:00.441
Is it Lorraine?

19:02.280 --> 19:06.080
All right. It'll come to me.

19:10.400 --> 19:13.244
The great Howard Stark.

19:15.040 --> 19:18.328
I have heard much of your genius.

19:18.400 --> 19:20.323
It is a shame that you put your gifts

19:20.400 --> 19:23.085
towards creating
such horrible weapons.

19:24.120 --> 19:27.920
Midnight Oil was not supposed
to be a weapon, Dr. Fennhoff.

19:29.360 --> 19:30.725
Should never have been used.

19:30.800 --> 19:34.771
And yet, it only exists because of you.

19:36.440 --> 19:38.408
Do you know what your creation does?

19:40.480 --> 19:42.289
I saw it.

19:43.880 --> 19:44.881
<i>Afterwards.</i>

19:44.960 --> 19:47.930
And I saw it while it happened.

19:48.640 --> 19:50.768
I was only spared

19:50.840 --> 19:54.003
because I had a gas mask
to protect myself.

19:54.800 --> 19:57.565
My comrades were not so lucky.

19:58.120 --> 20:00.282
My brother wasn't so lucky.

20:03.280 --> 20:06.329
When I found him, he had no eyes.

20:06.760 --> 20:09.525
Pieces of his flesh had been bitten off.

20:10.880 --> 20:12.291
Can you imagine this?

20:13.840 --> 20:16.002
I am sorry.

20:18.200 --> 20:20.965
You have no idea how sorry I am.

20:21.640 --> 20:24.564
Since that day,
I have thought of you often.

20:25.880 --> 20:28.963
In fact, you have been
my singular focus.

20:29.440 --> 20:32.808
Look, if you're gonna kill me,

20:34.000 --> 20:35.126
go ahead.

20:35.920 --> 20:37.843
I probably deserve it,

20:39.000 --> 20:40.764
but leave innocent people out of it.

20:48.240 --> 20:53.121
I have no intention
of killing you, Mr. Stark.

20:55.360 --> 20:58.011
I am going to make you suffer.

20:58.960 --> 21:00.962
Please.

21:02.960 --> 21:04.883
Please don't do this.

21:05.360 --> 21:07.681
You feel guilt? Remorse?

21:08.640 --> 21:10.290
Yes, of course, I do.

21:10.360 --> 21:12.442
I imagine you have done
many things in your life

21:12.520 --> 21:13.646
that you regret.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.001
Hmm.

21:15.080 --> 21:16.081
A man such as yourself

21:16.160 --> 21:20.370
cannot allow kindness
and empathy to cloud his vision.

21:22.800 --> 21:25.201
I am not a bad person.

21:27.680 --> 21:28.966
Yes.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.081
Yes, you are.

21:36.040 --> 21:39.726
It is the only way to achieve
such remarkable success.

21:41.520 --> 21:43.727
Others have paid the price.

21:44.360 --> 21:46.727
 You have
paid the price, as well.

21:47.760 --> 21:50.331
Your guilt eats you,

21:51.600 --> 21:55.286
destroys you from the inside out.

21:56.960 --> 21:58.086
Yes.

22:00.120 --> 22:01.246
Yes.

22:03.400 --> 22:05.368
Focus.

22:05.440 --> 22:08.330
There may still be a way
to atone for your sins.

22:09.560 --> 22:12.484
Simply focus.

22:12.600 --> 22:16.321
Go back in your mind

22:16.400 --> 22:21.406
<i>to a time and place that
holds your greatest shame,</i>

22:21.680 --> 22:24.126
<i>and simply focus.</i>

22:26.760 --> 22:29.081
What would you change if you could?

22:31.160 --> 22:33.288
Mr. Stark!

22:33.360 --> 22:35.328
Mr. Stark, we picked up a signal
from the Valkyrie.

22:35.840 --> 22:40.243
We think it might be Rogers.
Sir, we found Captain America.

22:41.520 --> 22:43.170
Howard.

22:43.600 --> 22:45.443
Peg, is this real?

22:48.880 --> 22:50.405
Bring him home.

23:00.960 --> 23:02.530
Howard !

23:19.160 --> 23:21.925
- How long until he reaches New York?
- Twelve minutes. Maybe less.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.968
- Maybe we could talk him down.
-

23:24.040 --> 23:26.361
- You think he'd listen?
- Chief did.

23:26.480 --> 23:28.767
- Radio room?
- Second floor of the hangar.

23:28.840 --> 23:30.365
I need someone to take
one of those planes up.

23:30.440 --> 23:31.726
Why?

23:32.400 --> 23:34.482
Shoot him down with a plane
full of poisonous gas?

23:34.840 --> 23:37.002
You'd have to do it over the water
before he reaches land.

23:37.080 --> 23:38.320
Geez.

23:39.120 --> 23:41.521
Well, I'm not your guy.
I've never flown a plane before.

23:42.280 --> 23:43.850
- Likewise.
- I have.

23:47.120 --> 23:48.690
Mr. Jarvis, I cannot ask this of you.

23:49.360 --> 23:52.842
Mr. Stark would want to be stopped
by any means possible.

23:52.920 --> 23:54.046
We have little time.

23:59.040 --> 24:00.883
Help him get off the ground.

24:29.720 --> 24:33.884
<i>Signal is still holding strong.
Changing course to bearing 2-6-9.</i>

24:35.200 --> 24:38.841
Focus, Howard. You're doing very well.

24:38.920 --> 24:40.206
Hands up.

24:44.360 --> 24:45.361
Uh-uh, uh-uh.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.010
Lose the gun.

24:54.960 --> 24:57.361
Move away from the radio. Slowly.

24:59.400 --> 25:02.404
Peggy, it's so swell to see you.

25:11.640 --> 25:13.369
Isn't this fun?

25:18.600 --> 25:22.810
Full tank of gas, plenty of ammo,
you're good to go.

25:24.040 --> 25:25.644
- Excellent.
- Let's go!

25:26.600 --> 25:29.843
Jarvis, if you don't leave now,
don't bother!

25:30.440 --> 25:32.681
Look, I've flown planes before.

25:34.080 --> 25:37.243
I've just never shot a man down.

25:37.320 --> 25:40.608
If Carter finds this guy,

25:40.680 --> 25:42.603
you'll never have to fire a shot.

25:42.960 --> 25:44.803
Let's pray you're right,
Agent Thompson.

25:54.920 --> 25:56.649
Excellent. Focus.

25:56.720 --> 25:58.961
Howard! Howard, it isn't real!

26:04.800 --> 26:06.006
Go.

26:08.840 --> 26:11.844
I used to be so jealous of girls like you.

26:12.360 --> 26:17.969
I would have done anything
to walk like you, to talk like you.

26:18.280 --> 26:22.171
But now, I can be anybody I want.

26:27.720 --> 26:29.165
Oh, I've got a great idea.

26:31.080 --> 26:33.208
Maybe I'll be an SSR agent next.

26:33.320 --> 26:34.560
What do you think of that?

26:41.600 --> 26:42.840
I thought you'd be better.

26:56.080 --> 26:58.082
<i>Fennhoff's escaped
the radio room.</i>

26:58.400 --> 27:00.880
- We'll get him.
- I'll go around back.

27:00.960 --> 27:03.201
Sousa, don't let him talk.

27:03.800 --> 27:06.087
- If he talks, you're dead.
- You, too, Jack.

27:09.560 --> 27:11.130
- Dropping to 2,000 feet.

27:11.200 --> 27:15.205
- Howard, it's Peggy.
- Peg! I found his signal!

27:16.160 --> 27:17.685
<i>I'm almost there.</i>

27:18.000 --> 27:19.490
No, you must listen to me.

27:19.560 --> 27:21.164
I'm gonna bring him home, Peg.

27:21.240 --> 27:23.481
Fennhoff has put this fantasy
in your mind.

27:23.560 --> 27:26.040
He's trying to get you to deploy
the gas over civilians.

27:26.120 --> 27:28.122
Don't worry about that, Peg.

27:28.400 --> 27:30.971
There are no civilians where I am.

27:52.320 --> 27:53.765
Freeze!

27:54.800 --> 27:57.041
Step away from him, or I will shoot!

27:57.200 --> 27:59.601
I am unarmed, Agent Sousa.

27:59.960 --> 28:01.644
Hands up! Now!

28:03.560 --> 28:07.770
You will not shoot an unarmed man.
It is not in your nature.

28:07.840 --> 28:11.970
Unlike Agent Thompson here,
you are virtuous man.

28:15.480 --> 28:18.563
The war has damaged us all,
has it not, Agent Sousa?

28:18.640 --> 28:21.325
We will never
be the men we once were.

28:21.400 --> 28:22.606
- I'm not listening to you.

28:22.720 --> 28:26.645
I have treated many
injured soldiers, Agent Sousa,

28:27.080 --> 28:29.651
helped them to overcome their pain.

28:30.320 --> 28:32.800
All you have to do is focus.

28:33.520 --> 28:35.807
Focus on your pain.

28:38.640 --> 28:40.847
Howard, can you hear me?
You must come back.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.445
I know this sounds crazy,

28:43.440 --> 28:47.490
but that guy, Fennhoff,
he actually helped me.

28:47.600 --> 28:49.329
<i>He... He showed me how to do this.</i>

28:49.400 --> 28:51.209
I'm bringing Cap back, Peg.

28:51.680 --> 28:53.648
The men that you work with,

28:54.200 --> 28:58.285
they see you as broken, half a man.

28:59.360 --> 29:03.046
And Agent Carter,
I see how you look at her.

29:04.120 --> 29:07.408
But she will never value you
for the man that you are.

29:07.480 --> 29:10.484
How can she? She feels only pity.

29:10.880 --> 29:15.602
But we can change all that,
if you just focus.

29:17.840 --> 29:20.684
Point your weapon at Agent Thompson

29:24.840 --> 29:26.649
and pull the trigger.

29:28.520 --> 29:30.124
Sousa...

29:31.440 --> 29:33.124
Look at me. Don't listen to him.

29:33.200 --> 29:35.521
Excellent. Focus.

29:37.360 --> 29:38.600
Shoot him.

29:38.680 --> 29:41.809
No. Just snap out of it!

29:51.760 --> 29:53.364
Was he saying something?

29:55.400 --> 29:57.562
You son of a bitch.

30:00.960 --> 30:05.409
Howard, turn the plane around.
Come back, and we'll talk about it.

30:05.480 --> 30:07.005
I can't do that.

30:09.640 --> 30:11.563
<i>Done talking.</i>

30:12.280 --> 30:14.203
 N... No, wait.

30:14.280 --> 30:15.805
<i>Miss Carter?</i>

30:15.880 --> 30:18.929
Miss Carter, I have
Mr. Stark's plane in my sights.

30:20.400 --> 30:22.482
We are one mile from land.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.923
Miss Carter, should I take the shot?

30:30.400 --> 30:32.164
<i>Miss Carter!</i>

30:36.480 --> 30:39.086
Miss Carter! Can you hear me?

30:39.680 --> 30:41.364
Miss Carter!

30:41.440 --> 30:42.680
<i>Please! Answer me!</i>

30:42.760 --> 30:45.366
- No, I need more time.
- We don't have more time!

30:45.440 --> 30:47.920
Do not take the shot
until I tell you, Mr. Jarvis!

30:48.000 --> 30:49.286
Howard.

30:49.360 --> 30:51.931
Howard, Steve is gone.
He died over a year ago.

30:52.360 --> 30:54.601
There's something up ahead.

30:54.840 --> 30:56.285
It's him!

30:57.000 --> 30:58.081
I can fix this!

30:58.160 --> 31:00.003
You don't have to fix anything.

31:00.600 --> 31:04.889
Peg, all I've done my whole life
is create destruction.

31:06.400 --> 31:08.164
Project Rebirth was...

31:10.840 --> 31:13.207
He was the one thing I've done

31:14.000 --> 31:15.650
that brought good into this world.

31:17.200 --> 31:19.123
Howard,

31:19.200 --> 31:22.283
I know you loved him.

31:22.400 --> 31:24.971
I loved him, too.

31:25.040 --> 31:27.407
But this won't bring him back.

31:29.440 --> 31:31.488
Howard, you are
the one person on this Earth

31:31.560 --> 31:32.561
who believes in me.

31:32.640 --> 31:34.483
I cannot lose you.

31:36.960 --> 31:38.405
Steve is gone.

31:39.480 --> 31:41.403
We have to move on, all of us.

31:43.640 --> 31:48.123
As impossible as that may sound,
we have to let him go.

31:55.320 --> 31:57.163
<i>Peg?</i>

31:57.560 --> 31:59.688
<i>He was good before
I got ahold of him, huh?</i>

31:59.760 --> 32:01.524
Yes, he was.

32:02.840 --> 32:03.966
Where are you?

32:08.720 --> 32:11.291
Evidently, flying a plane.

32:11.360 --> 32:12.691
To Manhattan.

32:13.840 --> 32:17.242
I guess you can explain that to me
once I land.

32:18.040 --> 32:20.327
Mr. Jarvis, he's all right. Stand down.

32:24.240 --> 32:25.765
Thank goodness.

32:27.760 --> 32:29.569
<i>Tell Mr. Stark to follow me back.</i>

32:30.800 --> 32:32.529
<i>- I'll bring him home.</i>

33:01.520 --> 33:04.091
You were gonna shoot me
out of the sky?

33:04.160 --> 33:06.083
Well, I thought that was
what you would have wanted.

33:06.160 --> 33:07.571
No! No, it's not.

33:08.840 --> 33:10.808
And for future reference,
under no circumstance

33:10.880 --> 33:12.450
would I want anyone
to shoot or otherwise hurt me.

33:12.520 --> 33:13.806
You got that?

33:13.880 --> 33:16.008
Your point is amply made, sir.

33:18.120 --> 33:19.610
You're all right, Jarvis.

33:22.240 --> 33:23.480
As are you, sir.

33:26.080 --> 33:27.445
I owe you another one, pal.

33:27.520 --> 33:30.046
To be honest,
I've stopped counting, Howard.

33:32.480 --> 33:34.403
What are we
gonna do about this guy?

33:34.480 --> 33:36.323
I suggest
we put him in the trunk

33:36.400 --> 33:38.926
until we can find a permanent way
of preventing him from speaking.

33:39.320 --> 33:41.846
- What about Miss Underwood?
- I'm afraid Dottie escaped.

33:41.920 --> 33:43.490
I wager we haven't seen the last of her.

33:45.720 --> 33:46.767
Ida.

33:47.720 --> 33:50.246
That's her name. I knew I'd remember.

33:51.040 --> 33:52.485
Steel trap.

34:16.280 --> 34:17.565
Good work, Carter.

34:20.800 --> 34:22.085
Nice job.

34:27.440 --> 34:28.646
Well...

34:28.719 --> 34:30.210
- Good morning, Peggy.
- Mmm-hmm.

34:30.280 --> 34:31.565
You're here bright and early.

34:31.639 --> 34:34.166
I assume that means
you'll be staying with the SSR.

34:34.440 --> 34:36.841
Haven't decided, actually.
I just came to pick up my paycheck.

34:37.360 --> 34:40.204
Well, we'll keep the desk
free, just in case.

34:40.280 --> 34:41.246
She'll be back.

34:41.320 --> 34:44.880
Which one of you fellas
is Jack Thompson?

34:46.239 --> 34:47.480
That's me.

34:49.840 --> 34:51.683
Walt Cooper, United States senate.

34:52.560 --> 34:53.561
Walt.

34:53.639 --> 34:55.563
I just wanted to come down here
and personally commend you

34:55.639 --> 34:57.369
for the fine work you and your team did.

34:58.200 --> 34:59.770
An attack on Times Square
could have been a calamity,

34:59.840 --> 35:03.003
and what I hear is that
you saved thousands of lives.

35:04.200 --> 35:07.568
The city and the country
owe you a great debt.

35:07.640 --> 35:10.405
We need more men
like Jack Thompson

35:10.480 --> 35:13.131
fighting for freedom and security.

35:13.200 --> 35:15.009
You're all lucky that you work for him.

35:18.040 --> 35:19.405
I just did what needed to be done.

35:20.720 --> 35:21.881
Yeah.

35:23.840 --> 35:25.922
You play your cards right, son,

35:26.440 --> 35:28.920
and you could get
a Congressional Honor

35:29.000 --> 35:30.923
out of this situation.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.765
The President
wants to thank you himself.

35:33.840 --> 35:35.251
- Maybe next time, I'll vote from him.

35:35.360 --> 35:37.089
- Come on into my office.
- Thank you.

35:37.160 --> 35:39.162
How can you just sit there
and take that?

35:39.480 --> 35:40.527
Daniel.

35:40.600 --> 35:42.364
I'm gonna tell that senator
what really happened.

35:42.440 --> 35:45.125
- Hell, I'll tell Truman himself.
- It really doesn't bother me.

35:45.200 --> 35:47.441
Well, it bothers the hell out of me.
I saved that jerk's life.

35:47.520 --> 35:49.284
I don't need a Congressional Honor.

35:49.360 --> 35:51.601
I don't need Agent Thompson's
approval or the President's.

35:51.680 --> 35:52.806
I know my value.

35:53.240 --> 35:55.481
Anyone else's opinion
doesn't really matter.

36:04.560 --> 36:09.407
Uh, hey, I was gonna grab a drink.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.923
Right at this moment?
It's 9:00 in the morning.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.606
No, no. After I clock out.

36:14.920 --> 36:16.490
Want to join me?

36:17.880 --> 36:18.881
Um...

36:19.800 --> 36:21.131
Maybe another time, all right?

36:22.080 --> 36:23.445
I've got to meet a friend.

36:23.920 --> 36:25.843
- Sure. Sure thing.
- Yeah.

36:26.320 --> 36:27.606
Another time.

36:45.960 --> 36:47.689
Oh, my God. You're kiddin' me.

36:47.760 --> 36:50.730
I know what you're thinking,
Miss Martinelli, and, yes.

36:50.800 --> 36:52.484
The drawing room
has recently been refurbished

36:52.560 --> 36:53.800
in the neoclassical style.

36:53.880 --> 36:55.564
On the small side, isn't it?

36:55.640 --> 36:59.122
Well, it is one of Mr. Stark's
quainter residences, yes.

36:59.200 --> 37:01.965
"Quaint." You could fit the entire
apartment where I grew up

37:02.040 --> 37:03.041
in this room.

37:03.120 --> 37:06.363
Six bedrooms, eight bathrooms,
a rooftop terrace for al fresco dining,

37:06.440 --> 37:09.887
and the library has
a sufficient collection of first editions.

37:09.960 --> 37:11.928
And you're saying
we can stay here for free?

37:12.360 --> 37:15.682
Since the unfortunate incidents
at both your home and place of work,

37:16.160 --> 37:17.685
Mr. Stark has offered this residence

37:17.760 --> 37:21.526
to you and Miss Carter for
as long as you might require it.

37:22.480 --> 37:24.323
It's a bit far from the Theater District.

37:24.400 --> 37:26.004
I'll live with it.

37:26.080 --> 37:28.162
You got a phone?
I have to call my mother.

37:28.640 --> 37:30.165
Naturally.

37:30.680 --> 37:32.170
There's a telephone in every room.

37:32.840 --> 37:34.683
Oh, my God! Are you kiddin' me?

37:39.240 --> 37:42.289
How refreshing to meet someone
who appreciates the finer things.

37:42.360 --> 37:43.441
I appreciate the finer things.

37:43.520 --> 37:44.851
I just don't want to know
what's happened

37:44.920 --> 37:47.207
in and on the fine things.

37:50.840 --> 37:53.286
I imagine you're looking forward
to some peace and quiet.

37:53.360 --> 37:55.283
At the very least,
having both feet on the ground.

37:55.360 --> 37:59.126
Yes, I've allowed several of my duties
to fall by the wayside of late.

38:00.360 --> 38:03.045
My next project is quite engrossing,

38:03.240 --> 38:05.971
a complete and total overhaul
of the kitchen spices.

38:06.040 --> 38:07.530
Mmm, fascinating.

38:12.320 --> 38:14.891
But should you again find
yourself in need of my services,

38:16.520 --> 38:20.650
I would be honored to assist you
at a moment's notice, Miss Carter.

38:20.720 --> 38:22.370
Thank you, Mr. Jarvis.

38:25.960 --> 38:27.962
Uh, where is Howard?
I haven't heard from him.

38:28.040 --> 38:31.522
Presently attempting to negotiate
the return of his property from the SSR.

38:31.600 --> 38:33.841
Well, let's hope next time
he builds a better vault.

38:33.920 --> 38:36.571
Actually, he's decided
to destroy everything.

38:36.640 --> 38:38.404
Really? Well, that surprises me.

38:38.920 --> 38:41.730
He continues to believe
that no government, even our own,

38:42.160 --> 38:45.004
can be trusted with those
particular inventions.

38:49.320 --> 38:50.845
Especially...

38:52.760 --> 38:53.761
This.

39:02.400 --> 39:04.004
Howard is giving me this?

39:05.200 --> 39:07.806
He is under the impression

39:08.080 --> 39:09.969
that the sample
of Captain America's blood

39:10.040 --> 39:12.771
was lost when he was under
Dr. Fennhoff's control.

39:14.400 --> 39:15.925
So you are giving me this.

39:19.680 --> 39:22.763
I owe Howard Stark a great deal,

39:22.880 --> 39:25.451
but he does not own my integrity.

39:26.600 --> 39:30.446
I am quite certain there is
only one person in the world

39:30.520 --> 39:32.124
who knows what to do with this.

39:34.040 --> 39:35.644
You, Miss Carter.

40:17.680 --> 40:19.011
Bye, my darling.

40:43.600 --> 40:45.682
What did you say?

40:45.760 --> 40:49.048
I can't hear you.
You're gonna have to speak up.

41:07.760 --> 41:09.683
Don't despair, friend.

41:10.080 --> 41:12.890
The food here is actually quite good.

41:14.400 --> 41:16.880
A minor consolation, I know.

41:17.680 --> 41:21.890
You had a vision,
and it didn't come to pass.

41:23.360 --> 41:25.647
What is the point of anything now?

41:25.720 --> 41:29.247
But given time, and a bit of quiet,

41:30.120 --> 41:32.248
new visions will arise.

41:32.880 --> 41:37.249
I am familiar with your work
on matters of the mind, <i>Herr Doktor.</i>

41:37.320 --> 41:40.403
It would give me great pleasure
to hear your thoughts on this.

41:40.960 --> 41:46.490
Perhaps there is another way
for us to collaborate.

41:52.160 --> 41:55.926
I know things seem bleak,

41:56.800 --> 42:00.600
but you are, in fact, a fortunate man.

42:00.800 --> 42:05.840
You're imprisoned, yes,
but it is an American prison.

42:07.640 --> 42:12.726
And America is the land of opportunity.
