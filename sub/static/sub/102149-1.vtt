Hey, what are
you two doing over there?

01:00.872 --> 01:02.604
Hey, what are
you doing over there?

01:02.637 --> 01:03.972
Get out of here.

01:13.905 --> 01:15.105
You're so fast.

01:15.139 --> 01:16.172
Come on, come
on, come on, come on!

01:16.205 --> 01:18.771
Wait up, wait up!

01:34.637 --> 01:36.504

My brother Nico and
I was saving up for Christmas.

02:04.939 --> 02:08.139
Our dad was Santa
outside the bus depot.

02:08.172 --> 02:10.437
He was gonna get us a tree.

02:25.671 --> 02:27.939
Code two and 305.

02:29.139 --> 02:30.838
Leave it

02:32.171 --> 02:34.872
- Can I get it?
- No, leave it!

02:40.005 --> 02:40.872
Oh shoot!

02:45.604 --> 02:46.704
Who's that?

02:46.737 --> 02:47.972
It's Darla.

02:48.005 --> 02:49.039
Her brother wants
us to get married.

02:49.072 --> 02:50.504
But I don't even like her.

02:50.537 --> 02:52.072
And he's really scary.

02:52.105 --> 02:55.805
And he has a Versace scar
burned into his forehead.

02:55.838 --> 02:56.671
Shit!

03:00.105 --> 03:03.138
Where is your brother at?

03:03.171 --> 03:04.872
I don't know.

03:04.905 --> 03:06.838
Huh, well tell
him my brother, Jezeer,

03:06.872 --> 03:09.671
is looking for him to
make the announcement.

03:09.704 --> 03:12.171
- What announcement?
- He didn't tell you?

03:12.204 --> 03:13.570
Nope.

03:13.604 --> 03:14.939
We're getting
hooked up for real.

03:14.972 --> 03:16.805
He's my man on record.

03:18.772 --> 03:20.738
Don't you think I
oughta know about it?

03:25.537 --> 03:27.805
- You're his sister, huh?
- Last I checked.

03:27.838 --> 03:29.138
Well duh then.

03:29.171 --> 03:30.138
'Course you should know.

03:30.171 --> 03:31.138
All right,

03:31.171 --> 03:32.905
I'll let him know
Jezeer's looking for him.

03:32.939 --> 03:34.470
Thank
you, Nico's sister.

03:34.504 --> 03:36.939
- Billy
- Okay, Billy.

03:36.972 --> 03:38.671
You got pretty hair, Billy.

03:38.704 --> 03:40.138
Thank you, Darla.

03:40.171 --> 03:42.005
I'll come by Christmas
morning to show him my love

03:42.039 --> 03:44.772
and bring him the
present I made him.

03:44.805 --> 03:46.072
- Okay.
- Let's go

03:50.071 --> 03:52.171
You're in some deep shit.

03:56.071 --> 03:58.071
But the thing is,
I don't like her anymore.

03:58.104 --> 04:00.039
Her brother is scary.

04:00.071 --> 04:01.071
Really?

04:01.104 --> 04:01.939
Why?

04:01.972 --> 04:03.171
We don't cut right
to middle of 'em.

04:03.204 --> 04:04.204
Hang it man.

04:06.104 --> 04:07.071
Ow.

04:07.104 --> 04:07.838
- I don't know.
- Wait a minute!

04:07.872 --> 04:08.671
Look.

04:08.705 --> 04:09.872
Cool!

04:09.905 --> 04:10.604
Billy would like
that for Christmas.

04:10.637 --> 04:11.537
WHat?

04:11.570 --> 04:12.537
So what are you going

04:12.570 --> 04:14.504
to get your girlfriend, Nico?

04:14.537 --> 04:16.071
Shut up, Billy.

04:16.103 --> 04:18.536
So what are you gonna get her?

04:18.570 --> 04:19.738
Come on, stop it!

04:19.772 --> 04:21.204
You have
to get her something.

04:21.238 --> 04:22.038
No, I don't.

04:22.071 --> 04:24.470
I don't even like her.

04:24.504 --> 04:25.872
What's going on?

04:25.905 --> 04:27.104
What happened?

04:27.138 --> 04:29.872
This girl
Darla likes Nico.

04:29.905 --> 04:32.171
She's your girlfriend.

04:32.204 --> 04:35.005
Well, you better
get used to it, handsome.

04:35.038 --> 04:36.071
I don't like her.

04:36.104 --> 04:38.138
I don't like her brother either.

04:38.171 --> 04:39.005
He's a bully.

04:39.038 --> 04:41.071
He has a
Louis Vuitton scar

04:41.104 --> 04:43.872
burned into his forehead.

04:43.905 --> 04:45.138
- Versace.
- What?

04:46.872 --> 04:48.705
That didn't sound good.

04:53.939 --> 04:55.171
Stay away from school now.

04:55.204 --> 04:56.705
You shouldn't go
to school anymore.

04:56.738 --> 04:57.872
What do you think?

04:57.905 --> 04:59.071
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

05:02.104 --> 05:04.104
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

05:14.672 --> 05:15.939
- What?
- What?

05:15.972 --> 05:17.905
What's wrong?

05:25.238 --> 05:26.638
I think I'm just wondering,

05:26.672 --> 05:27.872
I'm going through
these magazines

05:27.905 --> 05:31.504
and I'm trying to figure
out what to give you.

05:31.537 --> 05:33.004
Nice try, dad.

05:33.038 --> 05:34.939
No really, I mean.

05:34.971 --> 05:35.905
No, really.

05:38.705 --> 05:42.470
If you could have
anything in the world

05:42.504 --> 05:46.004
that you wanted to
have, what would it be?

05:48.171 --> 05:49.071
I don't know.

05:49.104 --> 05:51.204
There's gotta be something.

05:51.238 --> 05:54.504
I'd get a Lamborghini
or maybe a Ferrari.

05:54.537 --> 05:56.605
How would you pay for gas?

05:56.638 --> 05:58.038
Oh, that
wouldn't really matter.

05:58.071 --> 06:00.038
I'll have a mansion.

06:00.071 --> 06:01.772
Well, when you
get the mansion,

06:01.805 --> 06:05.470
you gonna let me and Billy
come visit you and stay there?

06:05.504 --> 06:07.872
Or you're gonna
be too big for us?

06:07.905 --> 06:10.071
- No, you guys can stay!
- Thank you.

06:10.104 --> 06:12.571
- You'll have your own pool.
- A pool?

06:12.605 --> 06:14.971
Nico, you don't swim!

06:15.004 --> 06:16.138
Yes, I can.

06:16.171 --> 06:18.138
- No, you don't.
- I do!

06:18.171 --> 06:20.705
Got a new girlfriend

06:20.738 --> 06:22.038
What are you doing here?

06:22.071 --> 06:23.938
I didn't know you
had a new girlfriend

06:23.971 --> 06:25.138
You were supposed to
meet me at the station.

06:25.171 --> 06:26.772
You got a hair
prettier than mine.

06:26.805 --> 06:30.470
You got a hair prettier
than mine!

06:30.504 --> 06:32.971
Wait a minute, what
are you talking about, man!

06:33.004 --> 06:34.171
You're just like,

06:34.204 --> 06:36.071
- what, are you drunk?
- Can I get one of them?

06:36.104 --> 06:37.138
Yeah, just come on
in the other room.

06:37.171 --> 06:39.605
What's the matter with you?

06:41.071 --> 06:44.971
Yeah, get one out
of the refrigerator.

06:45.004 --> 06:46.004
It's all right.

06:46.038 --> 06:46.938
When are you
going to be back home?

06:46.971 --> 06:49.571
There
ain't nothing in here.

06:49.605 --> 06:51.071
What time you're
gonna be back?

06:51.104 --> 06:52.504
Huh?

06:52.538 --> 06:53.004
Wait a minute, let
me get this maniac.

06:53.038 --> 06:54.138
Get out!

06:54.171 --> 06:55.238
Who told you to sit down!

06:55.271 --> 06:56.104
You're not even supposed
to wear that on your hat.

06:56.138 --> 06:57.038
Get outta here!

06:57.071 --> 06:59.672
I'll be with you in a second!

07:00.638 --> 07:02.904
Are you gonna get a tree?

07:03.938 --> 07:04.738
Of course.

07:04.772 --> 07:06.672
Of course I'm going to.

07:07.872 --> 07:10.138
I got Nico a
present from Santa.

07:10.171 --> 07:11.938
That's wonderful.

07:15.104 --> 07:15.738
Hey, what?

07:17.772 --> 07:19.138
I shouldn't even come with you.

07:19.171 --> 07:20.904
You shouldn't be
walking into my house.

07:28.605 --> 07:29.772
Hey!

07:33.204 --> 07:34.838
Is your note for Santa ready?

07:34.871 --> 07:36.204
I don't
believe in Santa.

07:36.238 --> 07:38.672
Only little kids do.

07:38.705 --> 07:40.605
I believe in him.

07:40.638 --> 07:43.837
I think the people
who don't are stupid.

07:43.871 --> 07:45.071
Really?

07:45.104 --> 07:47.471
Then how does he
get in the house?

07:48.871 --> 07:50.705
I think elves make keys.

07:50.738 --> 07:53.871
Either that or he shrinks
in and goes down the chimney

07:53.904 --> 07:55.204
but I mean I don't know.

07:55.238 --> 07:58.505
As long as you make a note,
he'll get your a gift.

07:58.538 --> 08:00.138
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:06.538 --> 08:07.238
Pepperoni?

08:07.271 --> 08:08.672
Okay, I'll get some pepperoni.

08:08.705 --> 08:09.871
Do you want some basil?

08:09.904 --> 08:11.038
Throw on some basil!

08:11.071 --> 08:11.871
- Let's have some olives!
- No!

08:15.238 --> 08:17.605
Okay, all right.

08:18.271 --> 08:19.538
You're ready.

08:30.904 --> 08:33.571
When is
Dad coming home?

08:33.605 --> 08:34.705
Soon.

08:34.738 --> 08:36.138
He's coming home soon.

08:36.171 --> 08:38.471
You are
gonna tell me a story?

08:38.505 --> 08:39.138
Yeah.

08:45.904 --> 08:48.104
"The moment you doubt
whether you can fly,

08:48.138 --> 08:50.204
you cease forever to do it.

08:50.238 --> 08:52.204
So come with me
where dreams are born

08:52.238 --> 08:54.104
and time is never planned.

08:54.138 --> 08:55.771
Just think of happy things

08:55.804 --> 08:59.071
and your heart will fly on
wings forever in Never Land."

09:04.204 --> 09:05.038
Nico?

10:59.538 --> 11:00.138
Hey.

11:00.171 --> 11:02.071
Shh, quiet.

11:02.104 --> 11:03.071
Hey hey hey.

11:04.837 --> 11:06.471
Hey.

11:06.505 --> 11:08.138
Joy, joy to the world.

11:09.538 --> 11:10.971
Gotta put this up here

11:11.004 --> 11:13.238
Hugging a tree is a bitch
under any circumstances.

11:14.837 --> 11:17.104
Give me your
hand, let's get up!

11:17.138 --> 11:20.138
I'm okay, Billy,
that's all right.

11:25.204 --> 11:27.138
This just here is
a very special one

11:27.171 --> 11:28.104
for a very special
person that I have.

11:28.138 --> 11:30.571
So let's bring it
into the living room.

11:30.605 --> 11:33.104
- Okay.
- Slow, slow.

11:33.138 --> 11:35.071
Shh, you have to be quiet.

11:38.771 --> 11:40.138
Joy to the world, sweetheart!

11:42.837 --> 11:44.737
I was gonna bring a
present for your mom,

11:44.771 --> 11:46.771
but I don't want to
come on too strong

11:46.804 --> 11:49.471
'cause Freddie said
to me, "Fuck it!"

11:49.505 --> 11:51.538
Freddie said,
"Fuck it, fuck it."

11:51.571 --> 11:53.004
And I said,

11:53.038 --> 11:54.171
"You know you can't fucking
talking to me like that.

11:54.204 --> 11:57.071
'Cause that's my
wife, that's my wife.

11:57.104 --> 11:58.171
That's okay.

11:58.204 --> 12:00.004
She loves Chinese.

12:00.038 --> 12:01.239
You know what we're going to do?

12:01.272 --> 12:03.038
We were going take her
to Chinese tomorrow.

12:03.071 --> 12:04.071
That's what I'm gonna do.

12:04.104 --> 12:05.171
She thinks I hate it.

12:05.205 --> 12:06.804
I do hate it actually.

12:06.837 --> 12:09.938
But I'm gonna get
her the Moo Shu Pork

12:09.971 --> 12:11.205
I'm gonna get her
the Moo Shu Pork,

12:11.239 --> 12:13.205
'cause she loves that Moo Shu.

12:13.239 --> 12:14.171
She loves the Moo Shu.

12:14.205 --> 12:15.205
I'm going to get it for her.

12:15.239 --> 12:16.171
I'm going to get a Moo Shu,

12:16.205 --> 12:18.471
it comes with little cookies.

12:18.505 --> 12:19.938
I was so mean about that.

12:19.971 --> 12:21.704
I don't want to be mean.

12:21.737 --> 12:23.138
I wanted to her to
have Chinese food.

12:23.171 --> 12:24.171
Hey, dad!

12:24.205 --> 12:25.505
Shh.

12:25.538 --> 12:26.171
Hey you!

12:28.971 --> 12:30.671
Merry Christmas, sweetheart!

12:30.704 --> 12:32.904
Merry Christmas.

12:32.938 --> 12:36.604
You two are the only thing
that's true, you know that?

12:36.637 --> 12:40.837
You two kids are the
only thing that's true.

12:40.871 --> 12:44.138
And you're the only
good thing I ever did.

12:46.071 --> 12:50.537
And I'm really happy that
you're my kid, you know that?

12:51.938 --> 12:52.837
Yeah.

12:52.871 --> 12:55.004
I love you dad, I love you!

13:00.604 --> 13:01.438
Hey!

13:02.537 --> 13:03.604
Hey, Old Man!

13:04.637 --> 13:06.172
I got a tree.

13:06.205 --> 13:07.505
- Yeah.
- Yep!

13:08.771 --> 13:10.537
Good night, dad.

13:10.570 --> 13:12.004
Don't ask me where I got it,

13:12.038 --> 13:16.771

14:37.871 --> 14:39.737
Come on, let's go!

14:39.771 --> 14:42.072

14:42.105 --> 14:43.172
Come on!

14:43.205 --> 14:44.704
- Look.
- I'm coming.

14:46.205 --> 14:47.239
Look, he made a note!

14:47.272 --> 14:49.837
- I know, I told you.
- And he got us presents.

14:49.871 --> 14:50.671
All right.

14:50.704 --> 14:51.804
Don't open it now, Nico.

14:51.837 --> 14:52.637
Don't open it now!

14:52.671 --> 14:53.570
Stop!

14:53.604 --> 14:54.239
Wait for dad, wait for, Nico.

14:54.272 --> 14:55.072
Stop!

14:55.105 --> 14:56.105
Wait for dad.

14:56.139 --> 14:57.570
All right, fine!

15:03.072 --> 15:04.039

15:05.272 --> 15:07.172

Hey.

17:12.005 --> 17:14.105
Got you something.

Man said it was a

17:40.704 --> 17:42.139
Thank you, dad.

17:43.205 --> 17:44.537
Hey, hey, hey.

17:46.771 --> 17:48.105
You did that?

17:50.005 --> 17:51.139
You know what, hey.

17:51.172 --> 17:52.238
You know what I'm thinking.

17:52.271 --> 17:56.105
We have to hustle up right
now 'cause we don't want

17:56.139 --> 17:58.139
to make your mama mad, you know.

17:58.172 --> 18:00.039
Don't wanna make her mad.

18:04.172 --> 18:05.005
Pretty!

18:12.838 --> 18:13.737
Hey, Billy?

18:15.271 --> 18:16.637
How do I look?

18:19.072 --> 18:20.039
You look good.

18:20.072 --> 18:21.105
Yeah?

18:22.737 --> 18:24.704
You think that-

18:24.737 --> 18:26.872
- You looked better
before, you fat old man!

18:26.905 --> 18:27.838
Oh, Nico!

18:27.872 --> 18:28.671
Don't say that!

18:28.704 --> 18:30.139
How could you, hey!

18:30.172 --> 18:31.671
What did I tell you about
shooting in the house.

18:31.704 --> 18:33.105
You.

18:33.139 --> 18:34.939
I'm going to kick your
little ass one of these days,

18:34.972 --> 18:35.771
you know that?

18:35.804 --> 18:36.905
Don't do that again!

18:36.939 --> 18:38.570
And how can you say that to me?

18:38.604 --> 18:39.204
Huh?

18:39.238 --> 18:40.039
How can you say?

18:40.072 --> 18:41.570
You think I'm fat?

18:42.570 --> 18:44.238
I'm not here.

18:44.271 --> 18:46.139
I'm not home.

18:46.172 --> 18:47.671
Nico, I'm not home.

18:58.972 --> 18:59.771
Hi, Darla!

18:59.805 --> 19:01.139
Merry Christmas.

19:05.671 --> 19:06.905
My man there?

19:08.072 --> 19:09.005
You just missed him.

19:09.039 --> 19:10.039
He just left.

19:10.072 --> 19:11.671
Did you tell him about Jezeer?

19:11.704 --> 19:14.838
Yeah, told him
he's looking for him.

19:14.872 --> 19:17.039
Well, here's my present.

19:17.905 --> 19:18.905
Thank you!

19:18.939 --> 19:20.972
It's a family secret recipe.

19:21.005 --> 19:22.204
Isn't it, Peewee?

19:24.238 --> 19:26.838
You have a very
nice perfume on?

19:26.872 --> 19:28.072
Eau De Toilette.

19:28.105 --> 19:29.105
It's French.

19:31.604 --> 19:34.671
Well, I'll let him
know that you stopped by.

19:34.704 --> 19:36.171
Well I better get going.

19:36.204 --> 19:39.470
He might be out
there looking for me.

19:39.504 --> 19:40.138
Okay.

19:43.772 --> 19:46.204
Was that his girlfriend?

19:46.238 --> 19:47.039
And Nico.

19:47.072 --> 19:48.105
Was that your son?

19:48.138 --> 19:49.039
That little boy?

19:49.072 --> 19:49.872
My god!

19:49.905 --> 19:51.138
You're so cringy!

19:52.171 --> 19:53.039
Come on let's go!

19:53.072 --> 19:53.905
Chinese!

19:56.005 --> 19:58.738
- She's cute.
- I don't like her.

20:05.072 --> 20:07.838
I said Chinese, right?

20:07.872 --> 20:09.072
Yeah!

20:09.104 --> 20:11.704
I'm pretty sure
you said Chinese.

20:21.738 --> 20:23.705
Oh there she is.

20:23.738 --> 20:25.537
Only a half hour late.

20:26.905 --> 20:28.071
Who is driving?

20:30.972 --> 20:35.039
Why isn't she
getting out of the car?

20:35.071 --> 20:36.972
Just wait right here.

20:47.005 --> 20:49.171
Just let me finish my
cigarette and we'll be in.

20:49.204 --> 20:50.204
All right?

20:50.238 --> 20:52.238
We'll be in?

20:52.271 --> 20:54.238
What do you mean we?

20:54.271 --> 20:57.570
Beaux and I will go in
after I finish my cigarette.

20:57.604 --> 20:58.972
Come on.

20:59.005 --> 21:00.972
The kids are waiting for you.

21:01.005 --> 21:01.905
They're not waiting for him.

21:01.939 --> 21:03.772
It's not a
good time to discuss.

21:03.805 --> 21:04.772
- It's Christmas.
- Oh come on!

21:04.805 --> 21:06.470
So this is what happened.

21:06.504 --> 21:09.772
So this is what, can
you please have Chinese?

21:09.805 --> 21:10.905
Okay hold on.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.005
Wait a minute.

21:13.038 --> 21:14.038
Wait!

21:17.071 --> 21:18.071
You wait.

21:18.104 --> 21:19.171
Goddammit, open that!

21:19.204 --> 21:19.838

You need a ride?

22:29.171 --> 22:31.570
- Fuck off.

22:31.605 --> 22:32.504
Loose the pitbull.

22:32.537 --> 22:33.772
- Hey.
- Go, go.

22:39.738 --> 22:40.738
Who was that?

22:40.772 --> 22:42.537
It doesn't matter.

22:42.571 --> 22:43.805
You know them?

22:43.838 --> 22:45.004
No, no, they're
just some assholes.

24:38.071 --> 24:39.837
You know what, Billy?

24:42.904 --> 24:46.138
When was the last
time I cut your hair?

24:47.104 --> 24:49.104
- I'm going for a trim.
- Let's lay down, dad.

24:49.138 --> 24:49.938
No, no.

24:49.971 --> 24:51.138
Go get them scissors.

24:51.171 --> 24:52.171
This is going to be
better I'm telling you.

24:52.204 --> 24:53.805
- Lay down, dad.
- I haven't trimmed your hair

24:53.837 --> 24:54.871
- for a long time.
- Lay down.

24:54.904 --> 24:58.104
Hey, get me the scissors
and I'm going to cut.

24:58.138 --> 24:59.705
Hey I'm telling it's
going to be good.

24:59.738 --> 25:00.638
No.

25:00.672 --> 25:02.138
What do you mean no?

25:02.171 --> 25:03.138
No.

25:03.171 --> 25:04.871
Don't say no just do
what your father says.

25:04.904 --> 25:05.705
Just stop.

25:06.638 --> 25:08.171
What do you mean stop?

25:08.204 --> 25:09.138
Hey!

25:09.171 --> 25:10.171
Dad, stop!

25:10.204 --> 25:12.138
I asked you, come on.

25:14.071 --> 25:15.004
Please dad, get off.

25:15.038 --> 25:16.837
Get off!

25:16.871 --> 25:18.204
Dad please!

25:18.238 --> 25:20.505
Let go of her, please!

25:20.538 --> 25:23.705
Gotta do
the Christmas thing.

25:23.738 --> 25:25.538
Open the door!

25:25.571 --> 25:26.971
Don't do it, dad!

25:28.038 --> 25:31.104
- You're drunk, dad!
- I know what I am.

25:31.138 --> 25:32.038
I'm your father.

25:32.071 --> 25:35.738
You sit your ass down
now do what I say.

25:37.605 --> 25:38.238
Nico, stop!

25:41.804 --> 25:43.071
Dad!

25:43.104 --> 25:44.071
I'll kill you!

25:49.505 --> 25:51.871
Dad, can you hear me?

25:51.904 --> 25:53.171
Let her go!

25:53.204 --> 25:54.004
Don't worry about it!

25:54.038 --> 25:56.104
That's a little
cheap toy anyway.

25:56.138 --> 25:59.804
I'm going get
another one of those.

25:59.837 --> 26:01.971
You can't have this anymore.

26:02.004 --> 26:05.538
Nico, I'm saying I'm just going
to trim your sister's hair.

26:05.571 --> 26:08.904
I never should have
never let this grow.

26:11.038 --> 26:15.138
That's going go a lot
easier, you just sit still.

26:19.038 --> 26:20.204
You sit still.

26:23.871 --> 26:24.705
All right.

26:26.104 --> 26:29.638
You only get to be a
kid once, you know?

26:34.204 --> 26:37.138
Well you only get
to be a kid once.

26:40.138 --> 26:44.672
It's going to be all right,
it's going to be better.

26:46.771 --> 26:50.605
I know what I'm
doing, this is better,

26:50.638 --> 26:52.038
this is better for you.

26:52.071 --> 26:55.771
Just think about it
like a Christmas trim.

26:57.071 --> 27:00.571
It's a Christmas trim
for you, sweetheart.

27:15.138 --> 27:16.138
It's okay.

27:18.871 --> 27:19.871
You're okay.

27:21.204 --> 27:22.038
Shhh.

27:32.605 --> 27:33.938
It'll come back.

27:48.771 --> 27:50.804
What did
you do to your hair?

27:50.837 --> 27:52.704
I did it for you.

27:52.737 --> 27:55.038
I didn't want you to be alone.

28:06.004 --> 28:07.837
Daddy doesn't mean it.

28:08.771 --> 28:09.938
He's just sad.

28:14.871 --> 28:15.704
I promise.

28:53.205 --> 28:54.637
I got limes.

28:54.671 --> 28:56.737
I got the last bag of ice.

28:56.771 --> 28:58.171
The other store was out of ice,

28:58.205 --> 29:00.471
so I had to go all
the way to Dublin.

29:00.505 --> 29:01.138
I got to go.

29:01.171 --> 29:02.205
I'm here.

29:08.004 --> 29:09.171
Hey!

29:09.205 --> 29:10.737
What are you doing here?

29:10.771 --> 29:13.171
I didn't recognize you
without all that hair.

29:13.205 --> 29:15.570
I wanted to see you.

29:15.604 --> 29:17.038
Well, I'm sorry about
that Christmas bust,

29:17.071 --> 29:19.837
your dad kinda screwed that up.

29:21.172 --> 29:23.471
I got you and your
brother presents.

29:23.505 --> 29:24.704
Thank you.

29:24.737 --> 29:28.604
I would have brought
them If I had known.

29:28.637 --> 29:30.038
Hey, sweet cheeks!

29:30.071 --> 29:30.971
Hurry it up, huh!

29:31.004 --> 29:31.804
Just a second.

29:31.837 --> 29:33.637
I'm talking to my kid.

29:33.671 --> 29:37.438
Tell your mom bars
need to tend themselves.

29:39.138 --> 29:43.138
As you can see this is not
the best time to chit chat.

29:43.172 --> 29:45.104
Maybe I can come by
your place sometime.

29:45.138 --> 29:46.505
Yeah, I'd like that.

29:46.537 --> 29:47.938
Beaux loves kids.

29:49.104 --> 29:51.505
Look, can tell your brother
I said merry Christmas

29:51.537 --> 29:53.071
and that I got him
a present, okay?

29:53.104 --> 29:55.737
So maybe we can come and
visit with you sometime?

29:55.771 --> 29:57.172
Yeah sure, sweetheart.

29:57.205 --> 29:58.004
I'll talk to Beaux.

29:58.038 --> 29:58.904
We'll make a plan.

29:58.938 --> 29:59.771
Okay?

30:04.671 --> 30:06.837
Nico and I
missed school most days.

30:06.871 --> 30:09.537
Daddy didn't seem to notice.

30:09.570 --> 30:10.938
We stopped popping tires

30:10.971 --> 30:12.570
and found other stuff
to do for money.

30:26.205 --> 30:27.004
Thank you.

30:29.172 --> 30:30.172
No, get that
toilet out of here.

30:30.205 --> 30:31.004
I told you.

30:31.038 --> 30:32.172
I don't want it in here.

30:32.205 --> 30:33.004
Not everything worked.

30:33.038 --> 30:34.071
Get it out of here.

30:34.105 --> 30:37.139
Dad wasn't
talking but he was drinking.

30:37.172 --> 30:40.038
- Think fast.
- Hey, fuck you.

32:49.972 --> 32:53.570
Billie was right, my
hair was growing back.

32:55.804 --> 32:59.072
We sometimes saw
momma on the weekends.

33:04.904 --> 33:08.072
They took daddy to a place
to stop his drinking.

33:08.105 --> 33:12.972
They didn't really give him
a choice one way or another.

33:18.205 --> 33:21.671
You get a scar from
playing with that knife.

33:21.704 --> 33:23.504
You have really long thumbs.

33:23.537 --> 33:25.972
It might be because
you're smarter.

33:26.005 --> 33:27.205
See how that,

33:27.239 --> 33:29.604
we get same kind of hands.

33:38.072 --> 33:40.771
that I got to beat this thing.

33:41.837 --> 33:43.105
How long?

33:43.139 --> 33:44.871
A month, six weeks.

33:48.072 --> 33:49.737
You can't be with us?

33:49.771 --> 33:50.939
Yeah, sure I can be with you.

33:50.972 --> 33:54.105
It's just that I gotta
get better first?

You don't want your daddy
to act crazy, do you?

34:03.604 --> 34:04.437
Huh?

34:05.139 --> 34:06.905
- No.
- Me neither.

34:22.039 --> 34:24.039
You know mom says she
could let you stay with her

34:24.072 --> 34:25.205
for the summer.

34:25.237 --> 34:26.205
She says you could stay at
the beach cottage out there,

34:26.237 --> 34:27.469
go swim and everything.

34:27.504 --> 34:29.670
That should be fun, right?

34:39.804 --> 34:41.105
You like swimming?

34:44.536 --> 34:46.469
You don't like swimming?

34:50.771 --> 34:52.072
You like swimming?

35:05.771 --> 35:06.604
I gotta...

35:12.637 --> 35:15.204
Sorry, I gotta go to a meeting.

most toughest thing,

42:32.204 --> 42:34.571
Smart guy, huh?

42:34.605 --> 42:36.104
His name's Nico.

42:36.138 --> 42:38.104
- What's your name?
- Billy.

42:38.138 --> 42:39.871
Like Billy Holiday?

punch him in the face.

43:14.605 --> 43:16.238
You kids behave
yourselves today.

43:16.271 --> 43:17.171
Okay?

43:17.204 --> 43:18.104
Beaux can't take care of you.

43:18.138 --> 43:20.171

43:20.204 --> 43:21.138
And no sulking.

43:21.171 --> 43:22.071
No sulking around.

43:22.104 --> 43:23.904
It will only piss him off.

43:23.938 --> 43:25.104
All right.

43:25.138 --> 43:26.538
He's not used to you
kids and all the energy

43:26.571 --> 43:29.138
that you bring to the party.

43:29.171 --> 43:33.104
And I really think one or
both of you needs to apologize

43:33.138 --> 43:35.171
for upsetting him
in the first place.

43:35.204 --> 43:36.471
All right?

43:36.505 --> 43:37.138
Why?

43:39.505 --> 43:41.938
I just think that things
would go a lot smoother

43:41.971 --> 43:44.204
if you apologize so
he can feel better

43:44.238 --> 43:47.138
about you guys
ruining his time off.

43:49.104 --> 43:52.138
- He didn't sign up for this.
- Whoo!

44:02.038 --> 44:03.971
I'm starving.

44:09.871 --> 44:10.704
What?

44:12.204 --> 44:15.737
They would like to
apologize for last night.

44:15.771 --> 44:18.104
I think they're
just feeling too shy

44:18.138 --> 44:20.038
or a little too ungrateful

44:20.071 --> 44:22.071
right now to make
the effort right now.

44:22.104 --> 44:23.238
No apologies necessary.

44:23.272 --> 44:27.038
We are 100% cool, right guys?

44:27.071 --> 44:30.538
- He asked you a question.
- Ease off 'em a little, huh?

44:30.571 --> 44:31.771
I get it.

44:31.804 --> 44:33.204
My old man beat
the shit outta me

44:33.238 --> 44:37.004

and I forgave him.

44:37.038 --> 44:40.704

going fishing today.

48:25.737 --> 48:28.704
Nobody knows about this place.

48:28.737 --> 48:30.570
How did you find it?

48:30.604 --> 48:33.904
Me and my dad used
to go fishing here.

48:38.072 --> 48:40.938
That wasn't
your mom's car, right?

48:40.971 --> 48:42.837
No, it wasn't.

48:42.871 --> 48:44.537
We should walk back.

48:51.005 --> 48:52.039
All right, see you.

49:07.904 --> 49:09.039
You move fast.

49:12.537 --> 49:13.804
Nico.

49:15.072 --> 49:16.039
Hey!

49:16.072 --> 49:19.837
You showed your sister
what we caught today?

49:19.871 --> 49:20.938
I caught it.

49:20.972 --> 49:24.205
He was next to me the
whole time, the little guy.

49:24.239 --> 49:25.504
We had a lot of fun today.

49:25.537 --> 49:26.972
Didn't we, champ?

49:31.604 --> 49:34.072
Your brother's a bit of a pussy.

49:35.172 --> 49:36.205
I think so too.

49:39.105 --> 49:41.172
What happened, Nico?

49:41.205 --> 49:43.139
Did he hit you?

49:43.172 --> 49:45.072
I am not a pussy.

49:45.105 --> 49:47.039
Talk to me, what happened?

49:47.072 --> 49:49.537
He pulled out his penis.

49:49.570 --> 49:50.939
What?

49:50.972 --> 49:52.139
Did he hurt you?

49:52.172 --> 49:53.871
I'm not a pussy.

49:59.105 --> 50:00.039
Don't tell.

50:02.904 --> 50:03.871
Hey, don't
stink up the joint.

50:03.904 --> 50:05.205
I gotta take a dump.

50:05.239 --> 50:06.072
Come on!

50:07.871 --> 50:08.771
Let's go.

50:08.804 --> 50:11.105
Hey everybody, momma's home!

50:15.904 --> 50:16.737
No hello?

50:19.072 --> 50:20.837
Mom, you need
to know something.

50:20.871 --> 50:22.704
I need to get
these clothes off.

50:22.737 --> 50:25.105
Jesus, you can't wait?

50:25.139 --> 50:28.039
Baby, your daughter
caught something of her own.

50:28.072 --> 50:31.172
I told her she works
faster than her mother.

50:33.139 --> 50:34.737
Don't tell me
you're high on weed?

50:34.771 --> 50:35.570
No, mom.

50:37.105 --> 50:38.704
Beaux did something.

50:38.737 --> 50:39.737
Did he give you weed?

50:39.771 --> 50:42.105
No, he made Nico look at him.

50:43.072 --> 50:44.239
Did what?

50:44.271 --> 50:47.172
He made Nico
touch his privates.

50:47.205 --> 50:48.871
How dare you?

50:48.905 --> 50:50.637
I knew it was a mistake
to bring you here.

50:50.671 --> 50:52.205
Now you're going to make
some shit up like that!

50:52.239 --> 50:53.637
Hey!

50:53.671 --> 50:54.737
Who is gonna help me
cook this sucker, huh?

50:54.771 --> 50:55.837
Get in here.

50:55.872 --> 50:58.105
I don't wanna hear another
fucking word about this.

50:58.139 --> 50:59.172
You understand me?

50:59.205 --> 51:01.737
You keep your little porn
fantasies to yourself.

51:01.771 --> 51:02.604
All right?

51:03.671 --> 51:05.205
Nico didn't make it up.

51:05.238 --> 51:09.504
You fucking ruin this,
I'll go ape shit on you.

51:09.537 --> 51:11.039
You understand me?

51:12.139 --> 51:14.039
This fish
ain't gonna cook itself.

51:14.072 --> 51:15.504
Just a second!

51:15.537 --> 51:17.537
Don't fucking ruin it!

51:37.072 --> 51:40.470
Maybe your lover boy
wants to join us for dinner.

51:40.504 --> 51:42.172
He better wear protections.

51:42.204 --> 51:43.604
It's not funny.

51:43.637 --> 51:44.905
Your mom
knows all about that.

51:44.939 --> 51:46.771
All right stop it.

51:46.804 --> 51:48.771
Oh my god, I'm out of
smokes for god's sake.

51:48.804 --> 51:53.804
I gotta go sown to the package
store to pick up some smokes.

51:56.238 --> 51:57.704
You wanna come out?

51:57.737 --> 51:58.537
I can't right now.

51:58.570 --> 51:59.470
Why not?

51:59.504 --> 52:00.470
I have to be with my brother.

52:00.504 --> 52:02.838
You can just tell him to come.

52:02.872 --> 52:03.838
I don't know.

52:03.872 --> 52:05.537
Hey, Billy.

52:09.039 --> 52:10.470
Where is she going?

52:10.504 --> 52:14.504
He told her to
get cigarettes and beer.

52:15.637 --> 52:18.039
Get your things, we're going.

52:22.271 --> 52:23.771
- Where are we going?
- I don't know.

52:23.805 --> 52:25.005
To get dad.

52:25.039 --> 52:26.072
Hurry up!

52:29.604 --> 52:32.171
Stay here, don't move.

52:32.204 --> 52:36.171
Come out, come
out, wherever you are.

52:36.204 --> 52:38.204
I know you're in here.

52:41.005 --> 52:42.604
I thought we had
an understanding

52:42.637 --> 52:45.470
about what happens
to tattle tales.

52:49.972 --> 52:51.039
Apparently not.

52:52.138 --> 52:52.972
No.

52:54.171 --> 52:59.105
I can be a fun guy, given
half the chance, if I'm happy.

53:00.105 --> 53:02.637
You could ask your
mother about that.

53:04.039 --> 53:06.204
And now I'm getting happy.

53:12.637 --> 53:15.905
Get off me, get off me.

53:15.939 --> 53:16.838
Motherfucker!

53:25.772 --> 53:28.171
Let's get the fuck outta here!

53:28.204 --> 53:29.039
Come on.

53:30.171 --> 53:30.738
- Wait.
- Nico, what are you doing?

53:30.772 --> 53:31.604
Come on!

54:08.537 --> 54:11.104
So, what if we killed him?

54:11.138 --> 54:13.570
He deserved it.

54:13.604 --> 54:15.570
I think I killed him.

54:15.604 --> 54:17.872
For the record I killed him.

54:17.905 --> 54:21.104
It's pretty easy to prove
something it was self defense.

54:21.138 --> 54:24.905
Looks like a molester
from a mile away.

54:24.939 --> 54:26.570
What are we going to do now?

54:26.604 --> 54:28.972
My dad lives in Florida.

54:29.005 --> 54:30.838
So we're on the run?

54:30.872 --> 54:34.005
Yeah, we're outlaws
and renegades.

54:34.038 --> 54:36.038
Outlaws and renegades.

54:37.138 --> 54:38.171
Yep.

54:44.171 --> 54:46.972
Outlaws and renegades!

56:57.038 --> 56:59.705
It looks good on you.

56:59.738 --> 57:00.738
Thank you.

57:01.971 --> 57:05.171
For a second, I thought you
weren't going to come back up.

57:05.204 --> 57:06.904
I like to dive.

57:06.938 --> 57:09.705
You
weren't scared huh?

57:10.571 --> 57:11.971
You don't swim?

57:13.104 --> 57:14.871
I actually don't.

57:21.505 --> 57:23.004
These things suck.

57:26.171 --> 57:28.104
Now no one can find us.

58:52.071 --> 58:53.705
How do you
know no one's home?

58:53.738 --> 58:56.971
Rich people buy
houses and they don't use it.

58:57.004 --> 58:58.638
Aren't there alarms?

58:58.672 --> 58:59.571
Probably.

59:02.071 --> 59:04.804
How do you know
how to do so many things?

59:04.837 --> 59:06.038
Because I read.

59:33.171 --> 59:35.038
Wow this is so cool.

59:59.071 --> 01:00:00.104
Come on.

01:00:32.837 --> 01:00:33.638
Yeah.

01:00:41.271 --> 01:00:43.138
Let me have that.

01:00:48.804 --> 01:00:49.704
Yeah.

01:00:49.737 --> 01:00:51.104
The name of the dance.

01:00:51.138 --> 01:00:53.171
Do it, do it.

01:00:55.938 --> 01:00:59.138
And everybody
starts to move

01:00:59.171 --> 01:01:01.904
as soon as "Pata
Pata" starts to play.

01:01:01.938 --> 01:01:02.737
Whooo!

01:01:29.605 --> 01:01:30.204
Clap!

01:01:44.771 --> 01:01:45.904
Clap!

01:01:52.204 --> 01:01:53.904
- Oh shit.
- Clap!

01:02:00.038 --> 01:02:01.038
Clap!

01:02:11.871 --> 01:02:12.704
Clap.

01:02:20.637 --> 01:02:21.637
What the -

01:02:25.138 --> 01:02:26.171
- Nico, what the fuck!

01:02:26.205 --> 01:02:28.071
I didn't know it was real.

01:02:28.104 --> 01:02:29.104
Holy shit.

01:02:37.071 --> 01:02:37.871
Nice shot.

01:02:41.138 --> 01:02:42.104
Not funny!

01:02:46.138 --> 01:02:48.570
Wait, wait, wait.

01:02:55.272 --> 01:02:56.971
A butt.

01:02:57.004 --> 01:02:59.104
That took me, oh, I thought
that was something else, bro.

01:02:59.138 --> 01:03:00.537
Wait, wait, wait.

01:03:01.737 --> 01:03:03.837
Billy, are we convicts?

01:03:05.904 --> 01:03:06.971
No.

01:03:07.004 --> 01:03:07.938
We are just kids.

01:03:07.971 --> 01:03:11.704
We're just ne'er do
well punk ass kids.

01:03:13.604 --> 01:03:15.139
What's a ne'er do well?

01:03:15.172 --> 01:03:19.071
A ne'er do well is
people that don't do good.

01:03:21.272 --> 01:03:23.570
That's a cool scar.

01:03:23.604 --> 01:03:26.837
Coolest scar I
have on my body is

01:03:26.871 --> 01:03:30.205
maybe the one next
to my eye right here?

01:03:31.637 --> 01:03:32.837
I mean it really hurt because
I smashed it on the window.

01:03:32.871 --> 01:03:34.504
I have one on my knee.

01:03:34.537 --> 01:03:35.837
I fell in a bush.

01:03:35.871 --> 01:03:37.071
Let me have a look at that.

01:03:37.104 --> 01:03:39.104
It used to go
all the way down.

01:03:39.139 --> 01:03:40.604
Yeah.

01:03:40.637 --> 01:03:41.904
What is that?

01:03:42.871 --> 01:03:44.239
One more scar.

01:03:44.272 --> 01:03:46.871
I remember I was whittling once.

01:03:46.904 --> 01:03:48.071
And I missed the stick.

01:03:48.105 --> 01:03:49.570
Oh shoot!

01:03:49.604 --> 01:03:51.172
This was recent.

01:03:51.205 --> 01:03:53.139
I thought that Dad gave you.

01:03:53.172 --> 01:03:54.704
Nico, I didn't know
you had so many.

01:03:54.737 --> 01:03:56.837
I don't
have scars anymore.

01:03:56.871 --> 01:03:59.938
But I did have a lot before.

01:03:59.971 --> 01:04:02.038
I got you all beat, okay.

01:04:03.671 --> 01:04:04.938
What?

01:04:06.004 --> 01:04:09.004
- It's a smiley face.
- Oh my God.

01:04:09.038 --> 01:04:10.239
How did you get that?

01:04:10.272 --> 01:04:12.105
I got it from
when I was a baby.

01:04:12.139 --> 01:04:17.139
I was crawling under an iron
board and it fell on me.

01:04:18.504 --> 01:04:19.504
Shit, I
can't beat that.

01:04:19.537 --> 01:04:21.072
It sucks.

01:04:21.105 --> 01:04:22.971
It's pretty bad.

01:04:23.004 --> 01:04:24.139
That's, Jesus!

01:04:25.871 --> 01:04:29.704
- I'm kind of tired.
- You want to go to sleep?

01:04:29.737 --> 01:04:30.904
Yeah.

01:04:33.272 --> 01:04:35.971
Go to sleep.

01:04:36.004 --> 01:04:37.139
- Billy?
- Yeah?

01:04:39.038 --> 01:04:42.570
I have bad
thoughts in my head.

01:04:42.604 --> 01:04:44.205
- Bad how?
- Things.

01:04:47.570 --> 01:04:49.072
Like bad things?

01:04:52.272 --> 01:04:54.637
You want to talk about it?

01:04:58.172 --> 01:04:59.205
Okay.

01:05:02.004 --> 01:05:03.039
I miss daddy.

01:05:05.172 --> 01:05:06.570
Me too.

01:05:06.604 --> 01:05:09.139
Will you
play that song?

01:05:09.172 --> 01:05:10.172
Yeah.

01:05:10.205 --> 01:05:11.205
Go to sleep.

Thank you.

01:06:00.105 --> 01:06:02.837
I lied about
how I got my scar.

01:06:07.105 --> 01:06:10.504
When I was like two
and a half years ago,

01:06:11.904 --> 01:06:15.771
I threw a Barbie doll
to my little sister

01:06:15.804 --> 01:06:20.205
and my mom got really pissed
and she hit me really hard

01:06:21.804 --> 01:06:24.871
with a belt and like you
can see my skin and my bone.

01:06:24.904 --> 01:06:28.804
And uh, the cops were
called, the firemen came.

01:06:32.737 --> 01:06:37.072
And then I got taken away
for 10 years, from my mom.

01:06:41.205 --> 01:06:44.570
She had to work very
hard to get me back.

01:06:47.704 --> 01:06:51.205
When she drinks she's
not the same person.

01:06:55.205 --> 01:06:59.804
And my dad couldn't take us
because he was in prison.

01:06:59.837 --> 01:07:02.105
He was supposed to
come pick me up.

01:07:02.139 --> 01:07:04.671
But I guess he got too busy.

01:07:06.939 --> 01:07:10.837
So I guess I'll just go
down there and see him.

01:07:13.139 --> 01:07:15.172
Anyway, it looks good.

01:07:16.637 --> 01:07:18.205
It looks like a smiley face.

01:07:18.239 --> 01:07:20.072
You can maybe sing
that song to me.

01:07:20.105 --> 01:07:22.704
The one that you sing for Nico.

01:07:24.939 --> 01:07:26.105
I'm mad tired.

01:07:27.172 --> 01:07:27.837

Hey!

01:09:23.038 --> 01:09:24.238
You okay?

01:09:24.270 --> 01:09:25.636
- Yeah.
- Good.

01:09:37.537 --> 01:09:39.038
- What did you see?
- You ending my life.

01:09:47.772 --> 01:09:49.703
Try it again.

01:09:58.637 --> 01:10:00.805
What did you see?

01:10:07.072 --> 01:10:09.204
Try it again.

01:10:35.905 --> 01:10:37.838
I can swim better than anyone.

01:10:37.872 --> 01:10:39.972
And I'm only 11.

01:10:40.005 --> 01:10:42.637
Let's get out of here.

01:10:52.905 --> 01:10:55.039
Three four, shut the door.

01:10:56.672 --> 01:10:58.772
Five six, pick up sticks.

01:11:10.104 --> 01:11:11.905
Other than the fact it's
the most disturbing thing

01:11:11.939 --> 01:11:13.171
I have ever done?

01:11:14.637 --> 01:11:16.504
It's not that bad.

01:11:16.537 --> 01:11:18.138
Oh very cool.

01:11:18.171 --> 01:11:20.071
In fact, fucking amazing.

01:11:23.604 --> 01:11:25.071
I'm hungry.

01:11:45.972 --> 01:11:46.838
Yo, come on guys!

01:11:46.872 --> 01:11:47.872
Check it out!

01:11:47.905 --> 01:11:48.738
Hurry up!

01:11:49.972 --> 01:11:51.104
You're mad slow.

01:11:52.570 --> 01:11:53.204
Come on.

01:11:59.570 --> 01:12:01.138
Smells like dog food.

01:12:03.838 --> 01:12:05.038
Tastes good.

01:12:05.071 --> 01:12:08.838
Imagine your favorite
food and take a bite.

01:12:08.872 --> 01:12:10.204
Shrimp tempura.

01:12:10.238 --> 01:12:11.138
Calamari.

01:12:27.838 --> 01:12:29.605
So where
are we going to go?

01:12:29.638 --> 01:12:30.470
South.

01:12:31.271 --> 01:12:33.470
My dad lives in Florida.

01:12:38.104 --> 01:12:42.038
It's practically like a
different country down there.

01:12:42.071 --> 01:12:43.872
hey have snakes as long as cars,

01:12:43.905 --> 01:12:46.138
monkeys, and trees.

01:12:46.171 --> 01:12:49.905
- Can I have one as a pet?
- What about our dad?

01:12:49.938 --> 01:12:51.571
We can send for him.

01:12:51.605 --> 01:12:53.838
He can make old friends.

01:12:53.872 --> 01:12:56.738
Do you think they
have good schools for Nico?

01:12:56.772 --> 01:12:58.004
Shit, how do I know?

01:12:58.038 --> 01:13:00.672
Can't be any worse than
the ones we got here.

01:13:00.705 --> 01:13:03.705
I want to
be home-schooled.

01:13:06.504 --> 01:13:08.138
I think Billie
Holiday spent the last years

01:13:08.171 --> 01:13:10.138
of her life down there.

01:13:10.171 --> 01:13:11.271
Really?

01:13:11.305 --> 01:13:15.138
Probably not but
it's way nicer than here.

01:13:35.038 --> 01:13:36.004
Can we go?

01:13:36.038 --> 01:13:36.938
It's really cold

01:13:36.971 --> 01:13:38.204
I think we should just
go back to the boat.

01:13:38.238 --> 01:13:39.104
It's a really bad idea.

01:13:39.138 --> 01:13:40.171
Shhhhh.

01:13:41.605 --> 01:13:42.571
Everybody!

01:13:42.605 --> 01:13:43.171
Shhh.

01:13:43.204 --> 01:13:44.672
Keep it down, okay?

01:13:44.705 --> 01:13:46.505
I don't want her to
know I am out here.

01:13:46.538 --> 01:13:47.672
Don't you know that by now?

01:13:47.705 --> 01:13:48.871
We gotta go.

01:13:51.605 --> 01:13:53.805
We gotta get going now.

01:13:53.838 --> 01:13:54.638
Help me.

01:13:54.672 --> 01:13:55.738
Would you do that?

01:13:55.772 --> 01:13:56.538
- Yeah.
- I have tremors.

01:13:56.571 --> 01:13:58.838
You ever seen a tremor?

01:13:58.871 --> 01:13:59.705
Ready?

01:14:04.638 --> 01:14:07.538
I'm down to one,
one before dinner.

01:14:09.638 --> 01:14:12.071
Stop moving please.

01:14:16.071 --> 01:14:17.471
There you go.

01:14:17.505 --> 01:14:18.738
Thank you very much,
I appreciate that.

01:14:18.772 --> 01:14:19.672
You're welcome.

01:14:19.705 --> 01:14:21.837
We should get going.

01:14:21.871 --> 01:14:23.104
Oh yeah?

01:14:23.138 --> 01:14:24.904
Well if you gotta
go, you gotta go.

01:14:24.938 --> 01:14:27.071
Hey listen let me
ask you a question.

01:14:27.104 --> 01:14:31.171
I'm down to one right
before dinner, you know?

01:14:31.204 --> 01:14:32.004
Hey hey hey!

01:14:32.038 --> 01:14:33.038
Come on.

01:14:33.071 --> 01:14:33.971
What's going on?

01:14:34.004 --> 01:14:36.471
Are you running from something?

01:14:37.605 --> 01:14:39.672
Are you running
away from something?

01:14:39.705 --> 01:14:41.871
No we're just taking a walk.

01:14:41.904 --> 01:14:43.171
Can I come?

01:14:43.204 --> 01:14:44.104
Can I?

01:14:44.138 --> 01:14:46.238
Well, you're kind of old.

01:14:46.271 --> 01:14:47.672
Kind of old?

01:14:47.705 --> 01:14:49.004
Who are you kids?

01:14:49.038 --> 01:14:51.004
We're renegades and outlaws.

01:14:51.038 --> 01:14:53.138
Well, if you want to
stay with me, you can.

01:14:53.171 --> 01:14:54.605
That's if she'll have you,

01:14:54.638 --> 01:14:55.571
if she'll have you.

01:14:55.605 --> 01:14:56.571
That's very sweet.

01:14:56.605 --> 01:14:57.571
Thank you.

01:14:57.605 --> 01:14:59.038
And that's if you are hungry.

01:14:59.071 --> 01:15:00.571
- I'm hungry.
- Me too.

01:15:00.605 --> 01:15:01.204
Yeah?

01:15:01.238 --> 01:15:02.672
You like tuna casserole?

01:15:02.705 --> 01:15:04.038
- Yeah.
- You do?

01:15:04.071 --> 01:15:05.071
Help me up.

01:15:06.138 --> 01:15:07.538
I'm down to one.

01:15:07.571 --> 01:15:09.138
Don't tell her you
gotta do me that favor.

01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:10.772
- I'm not going to tell her.
- No.

01:15:10.804 --> 01:15:12.004
You won't say anything either?

01:15:12.038 --> 01:15:14.004
- I won't say anything.
- You wont say a word.

01:15:14.038 --> 01:15:15.605
Follow me!

01:15:16.904 --> 01:15:17.738
Honey!

01:15:19.204 --> 01:15:20.605
Honey!

01:15:20.638 --> 01:15:22.238
Come on, come on.

01:15:22.271 --> 01:15:26.138
What have
you brought me now?

01:15:26.171 --> 01:15:27.672
We have company.

01:15:28.638 --> 01:15:29.638
Hi, ma'am.

01:15:31.104 --> 01:15:33.171
Did my husband
promise you some food?

01:15:33.204 --> 01:15:34.038
Mm-hmm.

01:15:34.071 --> 01:15:35.505
Tuna casserole.

01:15:36.705 --> 01:15:41.771
Well, wash up, help yourselves
to a plate and have a seat.

01:15:43.204 --> 01:15:45.038
Wash them clean now.

01:15:47.204 --> 01:15:48.871
We eat fast, okay?

01:15:49.904 --> 01:15:50.738
Okay.

01:15:51.804 --> 01:15:52.705
All right now.

01:15:52.738 --> 01:15:54.505
Be careful, take your time.

01:15:54.538 --> 01:15:57.538
You don't want to get
sick, there's plenty here.

01:15:57.571 --> 01:15:59.004
- It's so good.
- This food is great.

01:15:59.038 --> 01:16:01.038
Well I'm glad
you're enjoying it.

01:16:01.071 --> 01:16:02.672
Delicious.

01:16:02.705 --> 01:16:05.971
So are you
kids from the park?

01:16:06.004 --> 01:16:08.605
No, we're just
passing through.

01:16:08.638 --> 01:16:09.938
Oh, passing through?

01:16:09.971 --> 01:16:13.171
- Yeah, they're outlaws.
- And gangsters.

01:16:13.204 --> 01:16:15.171
Heavens,
imagine that.

01:16:15.204 --> 01:16:17.171
And soon
I'll be joining them.

01:16:17.204 --> 01:16:18.672
Right?

01:16:18.705 --> 01:16:19.505
Yeah.

01:16:19.538 --> 01:16:20.938
Well, you be my guest,

01:16:20.971 --> 01:16:23.638
but if you get caught, I
won't be there to get you out.

01:16:23.672 --> 01:16:25.804
We don't get caught.

01:16:25.837 --> 01:16:27.004
Oh.

01:16:27.038 --> 01:16:28.638
So so your parents
know you are outlaws?

01:16:28.672 --> 01:16:31.071
My dad's in the
hospital, getting better.

01:16:31.104 --> 01:16:33.938
- Oh he's sick?
- He drinks a lot.

01:16:35.104 --> 01:16:36.904
This is great food
Louise, thank you.

01:16:36.938 --> 01:16:38.138
Thank you.

01:16:38.171 --> 01:16:39.971
I don't believe
I know your name?

01:16:40.004 --> 01:16:40.804
Billy.

01:16:40.837 --> 01:16:41.971
My name is Billy.

01:16:42.004 --> 01:16:45.071
With a name like
that I bet you sing, huh?

01:16:45.104 --> 01:16:46.804
A little bit.

01:16:46.837 --> 01:16:48.471
That is a big deal, you know?

01:16:48.505 --> 01:16:50.704
That is a big deal.

01:16:50.737 --> 01:16:51.737
Yes it is.

01:16:53.538 --> 01:16:55.071
Have you been smoking
again, sweetheart?

01:16:55.104 --> 01:16:56.871
Why do you ask me?

01:16:56.904 --> 01:16:58.004
He didn't smoke.

01:16:58.038 --> 01:16:59.171
He wasn't smoking.

01:16:59.204 --> 01:17:00.104
Somebody was smoking.

01:17:00.138 --> 01:17:02.771
That smells little
like smoke over here.

01:17:02.804 --> 01:17:06.004
- Well I was outside.
- Okay.

01:17:06.038 --> 01:17:07.004
Okay.

01:17:07.038 --> 01:17:07.804
Hold on for a second.

01:17:07.837 --> 01:17:09.171
I think I am about
to bust a gut.

01:17:11.737 --> 01:17:12.804
I'm really stuffed.

01:17:12.837 --> 01:17:15.804
I told you that her tuna
casserole was the best.

01:17:15.837 --> 01:17:16.671
Didn't I?

01:17:18.505 --> 01:17:19.938
It's really good.

01:17:19.971 --> 01:17:21.104
When you're hungry,
it really tastes good too,

01:17:21.138 --> 01:17:22.138
doesn't it?

01:17:22.171 --> 01:17:23.004
Yes.

01:17:23.938 --> 01:17:26.004
Thank you
so much, it's great.

01:17:26.038 --> 01:17:27.171
You're very welcome.

01:17:27.204 --> 01:17:31.737
You know, when I am done
we really have to get going.

01:17:31.771 --> 01:17:33.138
Well if you want to
leave, that's okay.

01:17:33.171 --> 01:17:35.505
But I think I'd like to
take Billy in the back

01:17:35.538 --> 01:17:37.505
and let's do something
fun with your hair, okay?

01:17:37.538 --> 01:17:39.171
We're going to have some fun.

01:17:42.837 --> 01:17:43.704
Yeah, okay.

01:17:47.605 --> 01:17:49.605
Children are such magic.

01:17:50.737 --> 01:17:53.505
Then they grow into
little miracles.

01:17:54.871 --> 01:17:58.104
Then they become people
all on their own.

01:18:03.204 --> 01:18:04.038
Todd.

01:18:05.171 --> 01:18:07.038
To let our child go.

01:18:11.771 --> 01:18:13.704
I never had a daughter.

01:18:15.071 --> 01:18:20.138
But if I did, I bet she'd
be pretty just like you.

01:18:20.171 --> 01:18:22.704
They were kind
of lonely and sweet.

01:18:22.737 --> 01:18:25.104
I think they wanted us to stay.

01:18:26.704 --> 01:18:28.871
It felt kind of like home.

01:18:38.837 --> 01:18:42.904
They let us stay the night
in their son's camper.

01:18:49.104 --> 01:18:50.471
You guys sleep tight.

01:18:50.505 --> 01:18:53.004
Tomrrow, we'll have
some fun, okay?

01:18:53.038 --> 01:18:53.871
Okay.

01:18:56.671 --> 01:18:59.171
When I'm an adult
I want one of these.

01:18:59.205 --> 01:19:02.104
We have to leave
really early tomorrow.

01:19:02.138 --> 01:19:04.138
Why can't we stay?

01:19:04.171 --> 01:19:06.138
Don't you want
to go to Florida?

01:19:06.171 --> 01:19:07.004
No.

01:19:07.038 --> 01:19:10.071
You really want
to leave tomorrow?

01:19:10.104 --> 01:19:13.604
Fuck yeah, this
place is a dump.

01:19:13.637 --> 01:19:14.771
You guys don't want to leave?

01:19:14.804 --> 01:19:15.804
I have to leave.

01:19:15.837 --> 01:19:17.038
I killed someone.

01:19:20.570 --> 01:19:24.471
Billy, what happens to
kids that kill people?

01:19:26.737 --> 01:19:27.671
I don't know, Nico.

01:19:27.704 --> 01:19:28.704
You're fine.

01:19:30.071 --> 01:19:32.837
- I killed him, Billy.
- Nico, no, you didn't.

01:19:32.871 --> 01:19:33.671
You're fine.

01:19:33.704 --> 01:19:35.172
He's probably fine.

01:19:35.205 --> 01:19:38.038
I can tell the
police that I killed him.

01:19:38.071 --> 01:19:41.172
Nico, it was self
defense, you're fine.

01:19:41.205 --> 01:19:44.737
I don't want to be
a gangster anymore.

01:19:48.505 --> 01:19:49.139
Close your eyes.

01:19:49.172 --> 01:19:50.172
Don't worry.

01:20:02.239 --> 01:20:05.104
I'm sorry I got pissed at you.

01:20:06.637 --> 01:20:08.172
We can go with you.

01:20:08.205 --> 01:20:10.071
You don't have to.

01:20:12.038 --> 01:20:14.537
We're blood brothers, right?

01:20:15.504 --> 01:20:16.771
No surrender.

01:20:28.504 --> 01:20:29.971
They turned us in.

01:20:31.904 --> 01:20:33.537
The police are here.

01:20:36.570 --> 01:20:37.637
Hey!

01:20:37.671 --> 01:20:38.938
What are you doing?

01:20:38.971 --> 01:20:40.105
Just tell them I'm
the one who did it.

01:20:40.139 --> 01:20:41.139
No.

01:20:41.172 --> 01:20:41.971
Wait, stop!

01:20:42.004 --> 01:20:43.172
Where are you going?

01:20:43.205 --> 01:20:44.004
Billy!

01:20:47.971 --> 01:20:48.904
Are you okay?

01:21:09.105 --> 01:21:12.038
It's
gonna be all right.

01:22:45.671 --> 01:22:47.005
Billie must have made sure

01:22:47.039 --> 01:22:50.972
that the bullet did not
hit any major arteries.

01:22:54.039 --> 01:22:55.172
The doctor said

01:22:55.205 --> 01:22:58.005
that it was a miracle
that he made it.

01:22:58.039 --> 01:23:00.072
The police said that
it was an accident,

01:23:00.105 --> 01:23:03.105
even though he was
shot from behind.

01:23:03.139 --> 01:23:06.072
It was like Malik was asleep.

01:23:06.105 --> 01:23:09.072
He couldn't remember
me and Nico.

01:23:17.039 --> 01:23:19.871
Dad came home and he was okay.

01:23:19.904 --> 01:23:20.972
He was happy.

01:23:31.039 --> 01:23:33.737
I had some time on my hands.

01:23:51.139 --> 01:23:54.139
I wonder
where he was now.

01:23:55.039 --> 01:23:57.905
I wonder if he was scared.

01:23:57.939 --> 01:24:00.039
