Like, for real, for real?

00:17.851 --> 00:18.810
Uh-huh.

00:18.893 --> 00:20.645
What do you think
your new character's gonna be?

00:20.729 --> 00:22.897
Maybe they could make you,
like, a crooked cop character.

00:22.981 --> 00:23.815
I'm Junkchain.

00:25.233 --> 00:26.234
But <i>I'm </i>Junkchain.

00:26.860 --> 00:27.861

00:28.903 --> 00:32.449
Come on! Pick it up!
Y'all shouldn't be this out of shape!

00:50.425 --> 00:53.303
We need to know why they moved us
to that shit-stain time slot.

00:53.428 --> 00:55.805
-Who watches TV at two a.m?
-Yeah, that's the point.

00:55.889 --> 00:57.766
We need to know what they think
we did wrong.

00:57.849 --> 01:00.685
-Wait, do we have an appointment?
-No, Bash, we don't have an appointment.

01:00.769 --> 01:03.438
We're storming. An appointment
would defeat the purpose of storming.

01:03.521 --> 01:05.440

-Bitchin'. Let's do this.

01:05.523 --> 01:06.816
You win some, you lose some.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.527
All right, enough with the platitudes.
We're here to talk---

01:09.611 --> 01:12.280
You're here because we replaced you
with a men's wrestling show.

01:12.363 --> 01:14.741
-I get it. I completely get it.
-What?

01:15.784 --> 01:18.620
<i>GLOW </i>at two a.m.,
and men's wrestling at ten a.m.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.789
Guys, come in, please. Sit down, huh?

01:20.872 --> 01:23.458
You don't have to stand in the doorway.
This isn't parochial school.

01:23.541 --> 01:25.085
-[laughs]
-We just...

01:27.712 --> 01:33.009
They gave a men's wrestling show our slot!
And you wanna know why? Hmm?

01:33.093 --> 01:34.511
Truth is, they're better!

01:35.345 --> 01:37.263
They fly higher, they hit harder.

01:37.388 --> 01:39.891
They hit harder because they're bigger.
It's physics.

01:39.974 --> 01:41.643
Oh, fuck physics, Ruth!

01:42.060 --> 01:43.812
I need you to take everything you got

01:43.895 --> 01:46.106
and push it all the way
to the limit, okay?

01:46.189 --> 01:49.109
I don't know what else we can do.
We've been training almost every day.

01:49.442 --> 01:51.402
Okay, Carmen. [sighs]

01:51.486 --> 01:53.988
I don't need to hear excuses,
I need to hear results.

01:55.532 --> 01:57.450
Okay. Sorry.

01:58.034 --> 02:00.161
Hold up, wait. Don't apologize.

02:00.495 --> 02:03.039
You want bigger moves?
Fine, you'll get them.

02:03.331 --> 02:04.707
That's what I want to hear.

02:05.708 --> 02:09.003
Look, I know this is gonna be hard,
but I believe in miracles.

02:09.170 --> 02:12.132
And we are going to make
this miracle happen!

02:15.009 --> 02:16.386
Sam, anything to add?

02:16.803 --> 02:20.181
Ah, no. No, not at all.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.600
I've added all I could
over the last ten weeks,

02:22.684 --> 02:27.021
and I just don't think I could
possibly add any more at this point.

02:27.689 --> 02:30.567
Right, so we break our bodies
and wrestle harder

02:30.650 --> 02:34.112
-and magically get our time slot back?
-Yes! Thank you, Debbie.

02:34.821 --> 02:39.075
Look, I have it from Tom Grant himself
that this is what they've been missing.

02:41.870 --> 02:43.246
So, you met with Tom Grant?

02:43.329 --> 02:45.290
[Bash] Ugh! Debbie, I'm sorry, okay?

02:45.373 --> 02:48.209
It was a guy thing. We had
to the storm the gates. I mean...

02:48.293 --> 02:51.421
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't get back up
on your feminist high horse, all right?

02:51.504 --> 02:53.006
We didn't leave you out.

02:53.089 --> 02:56.009
We just think your focus
should be on performing this week.

02:56.092 --> 02:58.303
All right? You and Ruth
got a big match coming up.

02:58.386 --> 03:03.516
The continuing tale of the bereaved mother
and the insane Russian, right?

03:05.226 --> 03:08.521
And we're gonna be posting
more matches later this afternoon.

03:09.355 --> 03:10.190
[Bash mutters]

03:10.273 --> 03:13.735
Oh, yeah. Oh, Jenny, I'm gonna need
another gold jumpsuit for Cherry.

03:13.818 --> 03:15.486
-What? That's my costume.
-[sighs]

03:15.570 --> 03:17.739
Yeah, well, we're doing
a "loser leaves town" match.

03:17.822 --> 03:21.910
It was Bash's idea. It's gonna be
Chola Junkchain vs. Black Junkchain.

03:21.993 --> 03:24.787
Sort of like a South Central turf war.

03:24.871 --> 03:27.582
Okay, enough talking. Let's go! Carmen.

03:28.708 --> 03:31.669
There's a lot riding on you this week.
Do not disappoint me.

-[Sam] Tone it down.

03:39.177 --> 03:42.180
-What time do you want to rehearse today?
-Oh, any time, really.

03:42.305 --> 03:44.599
I mean, we could rehearse
from sunup to sundown.

03:44.682 --> 03:47.810

04:07.497 --> 04:09.249
Well, I can make up something similar.

04:10.124 --> 04:13.002
-Why can't we just do that move?
-[scoffs] The Lumberjack Chop?

04:13.503 --> 04:16.631
It's one of Kurt's signature moves.
If we use it, it's straight-up stealing.

04:16.714 --> 04:19.467
[scoffs] Stealing? How?

04:19.884 --> 04:23.721
It's a wrestling move. We're wrestlers.
What are they gonna do? Sue us?

04:24.514 --> 04:26.099
It just isn't done. [chuckles]

04:26.182 --> 04:29.227
Carmen, don't make this any harder
than it needs to be.

of moves here. Use them.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.710
Really? A festival?

04:54.377 --> 04:56.004
[Justine] Well, it's small

04:56.421 --> 05:00.300

banned horror films from the late '70s,

05:00.925 --> 05:03.177
but it's still awesome.

05:03.720 --> 05:04.721

I invited some people, but I think
it would mean a lot if you were there.

05:21.029 --> 05:21.863
You're like...

05:22.905 --> 05:24.032

05:25.116 --> 05:26.492

05:27.327 --> 05:30.830

more than anyone else.

-She's winning the match.
-Oh. Well, we'll just reverse it.

06:34.435 --> 06:36.396
Wait, Debbie. That doesn't make any sense.

You're supposed to be totally distraught
because your daughter was just kidnapped.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.819
You can't win against me
the first time around.

06:42.902 --> 06:45.696
If you win, there's no chase.
No chase means no story.

06:45.780 --> 06:48.074
I understand the concept
of the chase, Ruth.

06:48.157 --> 06:51.994
But Liberty Belle is on a winning streak.
She's won 15 straight matches. I mean...

06:52.078 --> 06:54.914
Carmen, wouldn't it be a little weird
for her to suddenly lose to someone

06:54.997 --> 06:56.833
-who has ring rust?
-[Ruth] Ring rust?

06:56.916 --> 06:57.834
Is that a thing,

06:57.917 --> 06:59.752
or did you make it up
to make me feel shitty?

07:00.044 --> 07:03.131
[Carmen] Are you two okay?
Usually, you do a lot better job

07:03.214 --> 07:05.299
at keeping your weird friendship stuff out
of the ring.

07:05.383 --> 07:08.052
It will not be a problem for me.
I just hope she can keep up.

07:08.719 --> 07:10.680
[Cherry] All right. Let's do the suplex.

07:11.180 --> 07:14.308
Maybe you should just try that roll thingy
that Carmen talked about earlier.

07:14.392 --> 07:17.061
-Yeah!
-Why? So the klepto twins can steal it?

07:17.270 --> 07:20.064
[Stacey] How could we steal it?
We're literally in the same match.

07:20.148 --> 07:22.275
It's not our fault
you still have to play a terrorist.

07:22.358 --> 07:24.902
Actually, it is. I had an exit strategy.

07:24.986 --> 07:28.489
Oh, I understand your plight.
For I, too, have been the victim of theft.

07:28.573 --> 07:29.490
Right, Jenny?

07:29.574 --> 07:32.326
Oh, my God, I did not steal Phil.
He was never yours.

Oh, but you know what was mine?
That jacket.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.705
What's up with everyone today?

07:36.414 --> 07:38.416
We got a big match coming up.
We need to focus.

07:38.499 --> 07:41.294
Why don't you calm down?
They're just airing their shit.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.921
Calm down? Why don't you calm down?

07:44.005 --> 07:46.466
Oh, I'm calm and ready for our tango.

07:46.549 --> 07:49.635
Yo, stop fucking flirting with me.
I'm straight, and I'm married.

What can we say?
We're naturally gifted show-women.

07:52.263 --> 07:56.350
-You're hams with hacky jokes...
-I did unspeakable things for that jacket!

07:56.434 --> 07:59.562
And I know you sewed extra sequins
into the crotch area of my costume.

07:59.645 --> 08:01.189
Maybe your vulva is overly sensitive.

08:14.577 --> 08:16.078
You wanna know why the men are better?

08:16.662 --> 08:19.165
It's because they shut up, do their jobs,

08:19.248 --> 08:21.167
and they don't talk about
their feelings ever.

08:22.001 --> 08:25.296

and get back to stretching.

11:13.214 --> 11:15.091
Okay, wake up. Let's go.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.387
Hey, Sleeping Beauty.

11:20.388 --> 11:22.390
[mutters]

11:23.557 --> 11:25.059
Oh, are you kidding me?

11:26.018 --> 11:28.020
Come on, I hate going to things
by myself.

11:28.104 --> 11:29.188
Justine!

11:30.439 --> 11:32.942
Oh, hey, Billy. Hey, Billy's here.

11:35.444 --> 11:36.278
All right, fine.

11:47.707 --> 11:48.541
Wow.

11:50.334 --> 11:51.335
Unbelievable.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.300
Sleep tight.

12:14.108 --> 12:16.110
[chattering]

12:21.365 --> 12:22.992
[sighing]

12:52.772 --> 12:53.939
[sighs]

12:54.690 --> 12:55.733
What are you doing?

12:58.319 --> 13:00.654
I wasn't sure if you wanted me
to sit near you.

13:01.405 --> 13:04.617
So you choose to sit right behind me?
It's-- it's creepy.

13:05.826 --> 13:07.328
So, should I...

13:16.921 --> 13:18.005
Jesus Christ.

13:19.465 --> 13:20.508
[sighs]

13:22.218 --> 13:23.427
[Ruth clears throat]

13:25.221 --> 13:26.305
Justine invited me.

13:28.641 --> 13:29.558
Where is she?

13:30.434 --> 13:31.393
Sleeping.

13:32.436 --> 13:33.979
-Is she okay?
-I don't know.

13:37.316 --> 13:38.484
Where's your boyfriend?

13:40.653 --> 13:42.822
-Boyfriend?
-Russell.

13:43.447 --> 13:44.990
-[sighs]
-Did he ditch you tonight?

13:46.283 --> 13:47.368
No, we...

13:48.077 --> 13:51.831
never really became a thing.
It kind of ended before it started.

13:52.790 --> 13:53.749
Huh.

13:54.708 --> 13:57.044
[woman] Mr. Sylvia,
you can intro the film, if you'd like.

13:57.628 --> 13:58.629
Say a few words.

13:59.588 --> 14:00.589
What? I...

14:01.340 --> 14:03.008
No, I-- Yeah.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.177
Just-- just play it.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.178
Just play it.

14:06.679 --> 14:09.139
You don't have to go up to the front.
You can do it right here.

14:10.891 --> 14:12.560
[sighs] Uh...

14:12.893 --> 14:14.645
I-- I think I'm just gonna sit.

14:15.521 --> 14:16.772
-Sam.
-What?

14:16.981 --> 14:18.774
Come on, say something.

14:19.733 --> 14:20.568
No.

14:20.901 --> 14:21.902
He'll say something.

14:27.658 --> 14:28.868
[sighs]

14:29.493 --> 14:32.454
Uh, this is <i>Gina the Machina.</i>

14:33.038 --> 14:34.999
I made it when I was younger.

14:36.542 --> 14:38.502
I think there is some good stuff in it.

14:40.087 --> 14:41.338
I don't fucking remember.

14:42.006 --> 14:44.008
[audience claps and cheers]

14:46.677 --> 14:48.095
[projector whirs]

14:48.178 --> 14:50.180
[suspenseful music playing]

14:50.514 --> 14:52.516
[audience continues applauding]

15:00.482 --> 15:02.359
Is this the one with the anal birth?

15:02.443 --> 15:03.694
Shh.

15:06.488 --> 15:09.033
[cheering]

15:12.661 --> 15:16.248
[man screams in film]

15:16.332 --> 15:19.335
[woman]
<i>Don't walk in there. There's a darkness!</i>

15:19.418 --> 15:21.629
[screams]

15:21.712 --> 15:23.714
[indistinct chatter]

15:31.221 --> 15:32.932
You're a genius, Mr. Sylvia.

15:33.307 --> 15:37.019
Oh. Wow. Don't call me Mr. Sylvia,
but-- but thank you.

15:37.645 --> 15:41.148
Your use of jumping the line in <i>How It Ate</i>
and the dysfunctional...

15:41.315 --> 15:43.651
-Um... uh...
-[whispers] "Disorientation."

15:43.734 --> 15:48.697
...disorientation factor is masterful.
Justine told us we'd love it.

15:48.906 --> 15:51.116
Justine? How do you know Justine?

15:51.659 --> 15:53.410
Oh, we're all in AV Club together.

15:55.079 --> 15:55.913
Huh.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.207
-Okay.
-[boy] Mm-hmm.

16:01.377 --> 16:05.839
See? You have a whole fan club
of teenagers who adore your movie

16:05.923 --> 16:08.884
that they are, for sure, too young to see.

16:09.051 --> 16:10.552
-Hmm.
-[chuckles softly]

16:14.139 --> 16:16.016
You know, I almost didn't come.

16:17.685 --> 16:19.561
I thought you were still angry with me.

16:20.646 --> 16:21.939
[sighs]

16:24.900 --> 16:26.485
I'm not angry with you.

16:29.655 --> 16:31.448
I'm an insecure old man.

16:32.574 --> 16:33.826
I get defensive.

16:37.371 --> 16:38.247
Sue me.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.672
-I liked your movie.
-Oh, come on.

16:47.256 --> 16:48.549
-Really?
-Yeah!

16:49.091 --> 16:50.843
Those kids were right. It was...

16:51.427 --> 16:54.888
disorienting.
You were... doing your own thing.

16:55.848 --> 16:58.642
<i>-Are, </i>sorry. You<i> are </i>doing--
-No. No, you're right.

16:59.476 --> 17:01.603
You're right. That was... [scoffs]

17:02.062 --> 17:03.397
...me 20 years ago.

17:03.772 --> 17:06.900
My hands all over everything,
making everybody crazy.

17:07.985 --> 17:11.113
I mean, when I was trying to get
that shot of the meat grinder,

17:11.196 --> 17:14.992
I made my operator so frustrated
that he quit and-- and, like...

17:15.409 --> 17:17.036
almost threw the camera at me.

17:17.786 --> 17:19.955
I had to shoot the rest
of the movie myself.

17:20.122 --> 17:21.749
-You shot that?
-I did.

17:22.291 --> 17:23.167
Mm.

17:26.795 --> 17:27.671
[sighs]

17:29.840 --> 17:30.674
You know...

17:31.675 --> 17:34.678
I'm accustomed to a certain level
of failure.

17:39.308 --> 17:41.185
It's just that
when a project usually goes wrong,

17:41.268 --> 17:43.062
I know exactly what happened.

17:43.145 --> 17:47.024
And it's usually me getting in my own way
or me not listening to other people.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.443
But with <i>GLOW...</i>

17:50.652 --> 17:53.197
I have no idea why they shit-canned us.

17:54.198 --> 17:56.033
Not a fucking clue. None.

18:01.497 --> 18:02.706
[exhales]

18:03.540 --> 18:04.416
I know why.

18:08.670 --> 18:09.922
That guy Tom Grant,

18:11.256 --> 18:13.634
he called me in for a meeting
in his hotel room.

18:14.551 --> 18:15.636
And he...

18:16.637 --> 18:17.638
came on to me.

18:18.806 --> 18:21.183
And I took off
before anything happened, but...

18:22.518 --> 18:24.686
he wanted to sleep with me.

18:24.770 --> 18:28.398
And I didn't give him
what he wanted, and...

18:29.983 --> 18:32.736
I don't know, that's probably
the reason why. That's...

18:33.821 --> 18:34.905
your answer.

18:37.241 --> 18:38.617
Are you fucking kidding me?

18:40.953 --> 18:42.079
No, I'm not.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.043
Fuck that guy!

18:49.128 --> 18:51.004
[laughs] Tom fucking Grant?

18:51.964 --> 18:54.716
-What a fucking sleazebag dickhead.
-Shh!

18:55.259 --> 18:57.719
There's no one in here. Wow!

18:59.138 --> 19:00.180
God damn it.

19:00.681 --> 19:01.723
Fuck that guy.

19:01.807 --> 19:03.892
-You're not upset?
-No, I'm not upset.

19:04.518 --> 19:06.645
Are you kidding? I-- I'm-- I'm grateful.

19:07.604 --> 19:10.983
The show's being burnt out
because of a dickhead network president?

19:11.775 --> 19:14.903
Not because of me, not because of you.
Because of that asshole?

19:15.404 --> 19:16.280
That's great.

19:17.281 --> 19:19.700
-It's the best news I've heard all week.
-[laughs]

19:19.825 --> 19:23.537
[chuckles] Oh, man, Tom Grant. Douchebag.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.581
[woman] Can you two leave already?

19:26.582 --> 19:28.458
-Oh, yeah. Okay.
-Um...

19:29.209 --> 19:30.460
-[woman sighs]
-Sorry.

19:33.547 --> 19:35.549
-[water spraying]
-[indistinct chatter]

19:51.481 --> 19:53.483
[soft piano music playing]

20:13.503 --> 20:16.006
[Mark speaking indistinctly]

20:16.798 --> 20:18.800
[chuckling] Listen, I think you're safe.

20:18.926 --> 20:20.052
I don't disagree.

20:20.385 --> 20:22.054
-Oh, look who's up.
-Oh, thank you.

20:23.555 --> 20:26.475
-Who's up? You want coffee?
-Thank you. Want some coffee?

20:26.558 --> 20:28.644
-[Susan] Who's got a bunny?
-[Mark] Like coffee?

20:28.727 --> 20:30.646
[Susan and Mark speaking indistinctly]

20:30.729 --> 20:33.690
-Coffee! It's so good for you.
-[Susan] Want coffee, little man? [laughs]

20:34.399 --> 20:38.362
-[chuckles]
-Good morning. Randy, Mark, and...

20:38.654 --> 20:40.906
I'm assuming your new girlfriend.

20:41.949 --> 20:43.283
-Debbie--
-Oh, Mark, calm down.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.077
I would just love
the pleasure of knowing

20:45.160 --> 20:48.205
the name of the woman you have
spending time with our son.

20:48.413 --> 20:51.917
It's a-- I'm taking a personal day.
We both are.

20:53.460 --> 20:56.004
And-- and I'm Susan, by the way.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.714
-Susan? Hi.
-[Susan] Mm-hmm. Hi.

20:58.048 --> 20:59.925
-We spoke on the phone.
-[Susan] Mm-hmm.

21:01.009 --> 21:02.594
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

21:04.471 --> 21:08.976
Um, so did Mark end up buying a bed?
And are you enjoying it? [chuckles]

21:10.727 --> 21:13.355
Yes, it's... nice.

21:14.356 --> 21:17.109
-Great.
-[clears throat] Look, I'm sorry.

21:17.776 --> 21:20.654
-It's not how I wanted you to find out--
-It's fine.

21:20.737 --> 21:24.032
You know,
life doesn't always go as planned.

21:27.911 --> 21:30.038
-I love you. Oh, I love you.
-[coos]

21:30.622 --> 21:33.709
Anyway, I have to run.
Enjoy the rest of your day.

22:28.305 --> 22:29.139
Glen.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.559
You know, he pisses off a lot of people.

22:33.101 --> 22:34.269
Could've been anyone.

22:46.823 --> 22:49.618
Don't mind me, man.
Just setting up for both of us.

22:49.785 --> 22:51.328
I know you're super busy.

22:54.831 --> 22:55.665
Hey.

22:56.917 --> 22:58.752
Hey. [chuckles]

23:00.462 --> 23:01.338
Have a good show.

23:02.839 --> 23:04.299
Yeah, you, too.

23:09.012 --> 23:11.807
Hey, where's Sam?
He's not in his office.

23:12.933 --> 23:15.060
-[Sam] Good evening, Ruth.
-Oh...

23:16.395 --> 23:18.688
-Justine.
-[Justine] Oh, I'm such an idiot!

23:18.772 --> 23:20.524
I can't believe I fell asleep.

23:20.774 --> 23:23.443
Well, I met your friends.
You're in AV Club?

23:24.736 --> 23:25.570
Yeah.

23:25.821 --> 23:26.947
I was in AV Club!

23:28.115 --> 23:29.783
You wanna man the booth tonight?

23:30.742 --> 23:33.161
Uh... Isn't that your job?

23:34.162 --> 23:35.122
Hey, yo, Phil!

23:35.580 --> 23:38.375
Phil! Yeah, hi.
I'm shooting the show tonight.

23:38.458 --> 23:39.626
Okay? I'm not firing you.

23:39.709 --> 23:42.671
I just want you to give a little more time
to finger my wrestlers backstage.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.632
So inappropriate, Sam. [laughing]

23:48.135 --> 23:51.346
So, you know, watch the shots.
Tell me what you see.

23:52.055 --> 23:53.849
I-- I-- I know you have opinions.

24:00.105 --> 24:00.939
What?

24:01.815 --> 24:04.192
Nothing. You just look so much younger.

24:05.986 --> 24:08.029
Hmm. Shut up.

24:08.113 --> 24:10.031
[laughs]

24:10.115 --> 24:12.117
[women chattering]

24:14.161 --> 24:15.454
[women laughing]

24:17.164 --> 24:19.499
[Dawn shouts] Rhonda, how are you?
What are you doing here?

24:26.465 --> 24:27.883
I'm tired of getting changed
in that locker room.

24:27.966 --> 24:29.759
Okay? I need my own fucking space.

24:29.843 --> 24:32.304
Some of us need time to think
and breathe

24:32.387 --> 24:34.389
and wash the shit of the world off of us

24:34.473 --> 24:37.017
before we have to go be
a fucking American princess!

24:37.100 --> 24:38.518
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:38.602 --> 24:41.563
Just save the misdirected anger
for the ring, okay?

24:42.230 --> 24:43.607
Sit down first.

24:43.690 --> 24:46.276
-[panting] I know...
-Sit down. Take it easy.

24:47.235 --> 24:50.197
Wow, you want a drink?
I got a drink. You want a drink?

24:51.531 --> 24:53.950
-This is good.
-[sighs]

24:54.034 --> 24:56.244
Here. Take a swig of that.

24:57.120 --> 24:58.330
-Come on.
-Okay.

25:07.839 --> 25:10.675
-Good. That's it. Yeah.
-Oh, my God. [sighs]

25:11.676 --> 25:12.552
Look at me.

25:13.970 --> 25:14.930
Divorce is rough.

25:17.766 --> 25:18.892
You'll get through it.

25:22.145 --> 25:23.480
You can get ready in here.

25:25.482 --> 25:28.401
I just don't want you murdering anybody,
just yet.

25:36.952 --> 25:38.954
[sniffles]

25:41.039 --> 25:43.166
[sighing] Oh...

25:54.886 --> 25:55.887
[chuckles]

26:06.064 --> 26:08.233
[snorts]

26:13.863 --> 26:15.198
[sighs]

26:15.407 --> 26:19.035
[Bash] This "loser leaves town" match is
really heating up!

26:19.786 --> 26:21.288
-[groans]
-[audience cheers]

26:21.705 --> 26:23.873
It's about to be lights out
for you, sucker!

26:24.541 --> 26:26.334
[chanting] Chop! Chop!

26:26.501 --> 26:29.129
-Chop! Chop! Chop!
-[groaning]

26:29.212 --> 26:32.716
[Bash] Boy, there's a lot of chopping
in this crowd, ladies and gentlemen.

26:32.799 --> 26:36.303
It looks like Black is refusing to crack.

26:36.386 --> 26:40.140
She's not gonna let Chola Junkchain
take what's hers.

26:40.599 --> 26:44.311
-Ha!
-[Bash] Oh! Goodness gracious!

26:48.773 --> 26:51.610
[sighs] Why didn't anyone tell me
we were watching up here?

26:51.693 --> 26:53.153
When would we have told you?

26:53.236 --> 26:56.281
During your match or while
you were tonguing Mr. Surfer Boy?

26:56.364 --> 26:59.409
-[Jenny laughs]
-Shh! Some of us are working.

26:59.492 --> 27:01.202
-[grunts]
-[audience cheering]

27:01.286 --> 27:02.495
Come on!

27:07.208 --> 27:08.752
One... Seriously, she wins?

27:08.835 --> 27:10.629
You think I wanna be
a generic rapper forever?

27:10.712 --> 27:12.339
-It's fine. She can have her.
-[Keith] Two!

27:12.422 --> 27:14.841
Sam, it's a private conversation.
Get the fuck out of my ring.

27:14.924 --> 27:17.260
I'm the director.
I can be wherever the fuck I want.

27:17.344 --> 27:18.928
-Okay. Three!
-[cheering]

27:19.012 --> 27:22.349
I can't believe it!
In the blink of an eye,

27:22.432 --> 27:26.645
Chola Junkchain
sends Black Junkchain packing!

27:26.936 --> 27:28.938
-Ha!
-[audience cheering]

27:32.942 --> 27:35.028
[Bash] All right, ladies and gentlemen,

27:35.111 --> 27:38.031
it's the rematch
you've all been waiting for.

27:38.615 --> 27:40.033
Coming into the ring,

27:40.116 --> 27:43.912
-it's Zoya the Destroya!
-Let's do this.

27:44.037 --> 27:47.082
-[march music playing]
-[audience cheers]

27:51.294 --> 27:54.297
Gimme my Savannah Rose back,
commie scum!

27:54.381 --> 27:59.427
[in Russian accent] Savannah Rose?
Oh! You mean Moscow Potato Blossom!

27:59.719 --> 28:03.264
The only mother she knows now
is Mother Russia!

28:03.348 --> 28:04.891
Give me my daughter!

28:10.397 --> 28:11.314
[grunts]

28:18.863 --> 28:22.659
Hey, hey, hey. Slow down, okay?
You're gonna hurt yourself.

28:23.159 --> 28:28.206
Oh! In an uncharacteristic move,
Liberty Belle shoves the ref aside.

28:28.665 --> 28:31.209
It would appear that nothing
can come between a woman

28:31.292 --> 28:35.088
and the one thing that gives
her life meaning, her child.

28:36.047 --> 28:37.966
[Keith] Hey. Come on,
get out of that corner.

28:38.925 --> 28:40.927
[gasping]

28:41.010 --> 28:42.053
-[Keith] One...
-You okay?

28:42.554 --> 28:43.388
[Keith] Two...

28:44.889 --> 28:46.599
[audience cheers]

28:47.851 --> 28:50.228
[grunting]

28:51.938 --> 28:52.939
[both grunt]

28:53.398 --> 28:57.652
Oh, my God! Liberty Belle
brings Zoya down onto the mat.

28:57.736 --> 29:00.947
It's like watching a speeding train.
It's riveting.

29:01.030 --> 29:03.032
[groans]

29:04.659 --> 29:05.910
Go, go, go!

29:08.955 --> 29:12.625
[Bash] I don't think she's gonna survive
the wrath of Liberty Belle.

29:15.503 --> 29:18.089
Wow! This is extreme, people.

29:18.173 --> 29:20.925
Liberty Belle has Zoya
in a submission hold.

29:21.760 --> 29:24.262
Will Zoya be able
to hammer her way out?

29:24.345 --> 29:29.434
[audience chanting] Liberty Belle!
Liberty Belle! Liberty Belle!

29:29.517 --> 29:31.728
[screaming]

29:35.899 --> 29:38.067
[heart beating]

29:38.151 --> 29:39.611
-[bones crack]
-[screams] Debbie!
