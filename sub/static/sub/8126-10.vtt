00:53.318 --> 00:55.854
thank you.

00:55.921 --> 00:59.157
What is it, ma?
It's a special delivery...

00:59.224 --> 01:01.860
For Mr. and Mrs.
Archie bunker.

01:01.927 --> 01:05.263
Ma, would you please tell me
how my soup tastes?

01:06.899 --> 01:09.367
Mmm!
Delicious.

01:09.434 --> 01:12.003
It just needs
a little less salt.

01:13.806 --> 01:15.740
Thanks, ma.

01:21.346 --> 01:25.483
Oh, my!
This is terrible!
Ma, what is it?

01:25.551 --> 01:28.019
"Dear Mr. and Mrs. bunker,

01:28.087 --> 01:30.155
"we regret to inform you...

01:30.222 --> 01:33.958
That your home insurance
has been cancelled."

01:34.026 --> 01:36.661
What?
Let me see that.

01:36.729 --> 01:38.663
Wow.
How do you like that?

01:38.731 --> 01:43.601
Comprehensive, fire, theft--
yeah, they cancelled it all.
Doesn't even say why.

01:43.669 --> 01:46.270
Archie'll be so upset.

01:46.338 --> 01:48.707
I don't know how
I'm gonna tell him.

01:48.774 --> 01:51.642
I hope he's in a good mood
when he gets home.

01:51.711 --> 01:53.377
Don't worry, ma.
I'll tell him.

01:54.513 --> 01:57.582
I wanna tell youse all,
life can be lousy.

01:59.819 --> 02:02.286
Maybe you'd better
tell him.

02:04.056 --> 02:06.057
Don't ask me
how my day went.

02:06.125 --> 02:08.526
You wouldn't wanna hear
the answer.

02:08.594 --> 02:10.829
Get out of
the chair here, huh?

02:12.397 --> 02:16.467
Hello, Edith.
How are ya? You're fine.
Thank you very much.

02:16.535 --> 02:19.971
That's all the talk
I wanna hear out of ya
till further notice.

02:22.141 --> 02:24.843
And a "dummy up, meathead"
to you.

02:27.379 --> 02:30.548
Now, that takes care
of this here group.
Where's Gloria?

02:30.616 --> 02:33.084
Well, she's in the kitchen
fixing dinner.

02:33.152 --> 02:36.354
Now, hear this, all of youse,
and pass the word
to the kitchen.

02:37.689 --> 02:39.724
I got a very
serious problem here.

02:39.792 --> 02:41.726
It's gonna take
all of my thinkin'...

02:41.794 --> 02:44.229
And all of my "consecration."

02:45.798 --> 02:47.832
This is where I'm gonna
be doin' it, here.

02:47.900 --> 02:50.668
Youse are all
gonna be helpin' me.
"How?" You may ask?

02:50.736 --> 02:53.138
By keepin' your mouths shut.

02:53.205 --> 02:57.375
I want youse all to synchronize
your tongues to silence.

02:57.442 --> 02:59.377
Ready? Begin.

02:59.444 --> 03:01.146
Archie,
here's something.

03:06.152 --> 03:08.519
Was I talkin' too fast
for you, Edith?

03:10.222 --> 03:13.158
Or were your ears
just too slow?
Stifle yourself!

03:13.225 --> 03:17.561
But this letter--
lick it, stamp it
and mail it, Edith.

03:18.730 --> 03:22.133
I got bigger fish to fly.

03:22.201 --> 03:24.135
Now, get me a beer
without a glass.

03:24.203 --> 03:26.404
And without another word.

03:28.573 --> 03:30.508
Uh, arch--
dummy up!

03:34.546 --> 03:36.480
[ Sighs ]

03:39.351 --> 03:43.354
- Archie--
- are you lookin'
for an argument?

03:43.422 --> 03:45.123
No, I just wanted
to talk to you.
Forget it!

03:45.191 --> 03:48.293
All I ask of you
is complete silence.

03:48.360 --> 03:51.629
Archie,
here's your beer.
Ohh!

03:51.697 --> 03:54.299
The letter with
a beer chaser, huh, Edith?

03:54.366 --> 03:57.635
What are you tryin'
to put over?
I think you'd better read it.

03:57.703 --> 04:01.672
Edith, you can't put
your mind on two things
at the same time.

04:01.740 --> 04:04.943
Your brain gets clogged.
It'll back up on ya.

04:05.010 --> 04:09.013
And there ain't no draino
for the braino.
Take it out of here.

04:09.081 --> 04:11.916
Well, here's your beer.
Now, wait a minute, Edith.
Hold it.

04:11.984 --> 04:14.152
This ain't
my regular beer.
Well, you see,

04:14.220 --> 04:16.454
that brand was on sale.

04:16.521 --> 04:19.423
So what, Edith?
If there was a sale
on dirty socks,

04:19.491 --> 04:22.593
would you buy them?

04:22.661 --> 04:27.031
No.
No, because you know I ain't
got no use for dirty socks.

04:27.099 --> 04:29.901
And I ain't got no use
for any beer except my own.

04:29.969 --> 04:32.737
And I don't wanna talk
about socks and beer!

04:32.804 --> 04:35.539
Would you like to talk
about this letter?

04:36.842 --> 04:38.776
N-o!

04:38.844 --> 04:42.446
Well, then I guess
I'll go help Gloria
fix the dinner.

04:42.514 --> 04:44.448
That would be nice.

04:49.021 --> 04:52.891
Uh, arch--
ain't you got nothin'
to do with yourself?

04:52.958 --> 04:54.893
Well, I wanted to talk to you
about this problem.

04:54.960 --> 04:57.328
I got a bigger problem
over here!

04:58.530 --> 05:01.933
Oh. You wanna
talk to me about it?

05:02.001 --> 05:05.937
I mean, there are certain things
a man only wants to discuss
with another man.

05:09.975 --> 05:12.277
I mean,
if you have a problem,
maybe I can help you with it.

05:12.344 --> 05:14.979
My problem is about work,

05:15.047 --> 05:16.981
which you don't know
nothin' about.

05:18.750 --> 05:22.320
Like you said, it's a man's
problem, and that's where
you get off the train.

05:22.388 --> 05:24.289
Okay, forget it!
Forget it, all right?

05:24.356 --> 05:27.458
Michael, what's the matter?
I tried to help him,
he kicked me right in the teeth.

05:27.526 --> 05:30.661
Archie, what happened?
Daddy, what did you say
to Michael?

05:30.729 --> 05:33.564
Don't bother him, Gloria.
Can't you see
he's got a big problem?

05:33.632 --> 05:36.767
Somebody probably
stole a twinkie
out of his lunch box.

05:43.875 --> 05:45.810
Funny.

05:45.877 --> 05:50.348
Well, if you think
my havin' to fire a man
is a little problem--

05:50.416 --> 05:54.085
oh, my.
Is that what's bothering you?

05:54.153 --> 05:56.687
That's right, Edith.
I gotta fire
one of my men.

05:56.755 --> 05:59.723
Why do you have to do
a thing like that?

05:59.791 --> 06:02.493
Well, I don't know.
It's because of
this depression...

06:02.561 --> 06:04.528
Or recession or whatever
they're callin' it.

06:04.596 --> 06:08.632
Nixon calls it
"a recent upswing in
the economic picture."

06:14.873 --> 06:19.910
Why don't we shove some food
in front of this pinko
and keep his mouth busy?

06:19.979 --> 06:22.046
Let's eat.

06:22.114 --> 06:24.548
That'll make us all
feel better.

06:24.616 --> 06:28.186
Daddy,
when did all this happen?
Oh, just today.

06:28.253 --> 06:30.455
The boss
sent the word down.

06:30.522 --> 06:34.192
He wants one man fired,
and I gotta recommend who.

06:34.259 --> 06:37.061
Why, that's an awful thing
to have to recommend.

06:37.129 --> 06:40.965
Why don't you recommend
something else?

06:41.033 --> 06:44.102
Because the boss don't want
something else, Edith.

06:44.169 --> 06:48.406
I gotta give one of
my three men the ax.

06:48.474 --> 06:52.210
Well, I got little Emmanuel,
the puerto rican guy
with the short leg,

06:53.545 --> 06:55.713
I got black elmo,
the colored guy,

06:55.780 --> 06:57.715
and... good old
stretch Cunningham.

06:57.782 --> 07:01.352
- The dope.
- Stretch Cunningham
ain't no dope.

07:01.420 --> 07:04.722
Archie, you said yourself
the guy's got an I.Q.
Of about one.

07:04.789 --> 07:07.758
I know, I know,
but it's been lately goin' up.

07:10.262 --> 07:12.196
Archie,
I.Q.S don't go up.

07:12.264 --> 07:15.400
How do you know?
You don't work with the man.

07:15.467 --> 07:17.701
I seen it goin' up.

07:17.769 --> 07:20.704
Anyhow, bein' smart ain't
the most important thing
on this job.

07:20.772 --> 07:23.674
The most important thing
is... dependability.

07:23.742 --> 07:28.513
That's what it is.
You take black elmo.
I can't depend on the guy.

07:28.580 --> 07:32.183
But you said he's never
missed a day of work
since he's been with you.

07:32.251 --> 07:35.319
I can't depend on him
keepin' that up.

07:41.060 --> 07:43.394
Then there's
little Emmanuel.

07:43.462 --> 07:47.165
Besides havin' a gimpy leg,
he don't speak no good English.

07:47.232 --> 07:50.668
How can you count on a guy
who don't speak no good English?

07:50.735 --> 07:53.771
Archie, Emmanuel's
your quickest worker.
You're always saying that.

07:53.838 --> 07:56.907
That's the trouble with him--
he's too quick.
[ Gloria ] What?

07:56.975 --> 07:59.810
He always looks like
he's doin' more
than he really is.

07:59.878 --> 08:02.513
What is he
really doing, Archie?

08:02.581 --> 08:05.349
I don't know, Edith.
By the time I get around
to check up on him,

08:05.417 --> 08:07.351
he's got it done.

08:08.520 --> 08:10.455
Let's face it, daddy.

08:10.522 --> 08:13.191
You're saying
Emmanuel and elmo
are your best men.

08:13.258 --> 08:16.594
That's right. And
stretch Cunningham's incompetent
but he's white, so he stays.

08:16.661 --> 08:20.298
Look, I couldn't fire
stretch Cunningham
even if I wanted to.

08:20.365 --> 08:22.300
There's 60 other
white guys down there,

08:22.367 --> 08:24.902
and they'd murder me if
I done a thing like that.

08:24.970 --> 08:27.004
You don't know how much
stretch means to them.

08:27.072 --> 08:29.006
Oh, yes, I do.
White power.

08:29.074 --> 08:32.610
- It don't mean
nothin' like that!
- What is it, then?

08:32.677 --> 08:34.945
Well, for one thing,
the guys all love him...

08:35.013 --> 08:37.881
Because he makes them laugh
and he'll do anything
for a laugh.

08:37.948 --> 08:41.552
Like, one of them blue mondays
not long ago, everybody's
feelin' lousy, see?

08:41.620 --> 08:43.953
So stretch goes outside,
he takes off all his clothes,

08:44.022 --> 08:46.056
takes a bunch of raisins,
puts 'em in his belly button.

08:46.125 --> 08:48.792
He can do that because
he's got the goin'-in kind.

08:51.163 --> 08:53.131
Then he comes runnin' back
and he says,

08:53.198 --> 08:56.734
"hey, look, everybody!
I'm a raisin cookie!"

08:56.801 --> 08:58.736
That's funny!

08:58.803 --> 09:03.441
Archie, if a black man or a
puerto rican did the same thing,
you'd call him stupid.

09:03.509 --> 09:05.676
But stretch Cunningham's white,
so he's funny.

09:05.744 --> 09:07.678
Ah, nuts to you!

09:07.746 --> 09:10.515
You don't know how
these guys feel
unless you talk to them.

09:10.582 --> 09:12.650
You don't know nothin'
about humor.

09:12.717 --> 09:14.752
Anyway, I ain't made
my final decision yet,

09:14.819 --> 09:17.522
so... why don't we talk
about somethin' else?

09:17.589 --> 09:19.524
All right.

09:21.160 --> 09:24.328
Your insurance
has been cancelled.

09:29.701 --> 09:32.470
Read this.
My insurance
is cancelled?

09:32.538 --> 09:35.540
Let me see--
oh, there's gotta be
a mistake, Edith.

09:35.607 --> 09:38.176
I always paid
every single premium.

09:38.243 --> 09:40.844
I ain't never once
put in a claim for nothin'.

09:40.912 --> 09:43.581
Maybe that's why
they cancelled you.

09:44.883 --> 09:47.418
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

09:47.486 --> 09:49.654
Do you see
whose name is signed...

09:49.721 --> 09:52.190
To the bottom
of these glad tidings?
Yeah.

09:52.257 --> 09:57.595
Wendell hornsby.
Wendell hornsby.
Your idiot nephew!

09:57.663 --> 10:00.565
The guy that
sold me this policy
in the first place!

10:00.632 --> 10:02.567
The one I had
wasn't good enough.
Oh, no.

10:02.634 --> 10:04.635
I had to scrap it
and buy another one
from this here jerk.

10:04.703 --> 10:08.539
But he was just startin' out,
and he's family.

10:08.607 --> 10:10.874
Your family, Edith,
not mine.

10:10.942 --> 10:13.944
Your family don't even know
I'm alive, except when
they want something.

10:14.012 --> 10:16.380
Seven years ago out of the blue,
Wendell's mother calls me up.

10:16.448 --> 10:18.949
"Oh, hello, Uncle Archie.
How are ya?"

10:19.017 --> 10:23.020
All of a sudden,
I'm elected to the family
as official patsy...

10:23.088 --> 10:26.457
So I can be the first
customer for this guy
and buy his first policy.

10:26.525 --> 10:28.892
And this is
my "thank you" note here--
cancelled!

10:28.960 --> 10:31.529
But I'm sure
it's not his fault.

10:31.597 --> 10:34.632
Yeah, arch. They don't start
cancellin' policies unless
they're payin' out too much.

10:34.700 --> 10:36.634
Maybe there's been a lot
of fires in this area.

10:36.702 --> 10:38.736
There's no fires
around here,

10:38.803 --> 10:41.305
except when Jim mcnab set fire
to his Christmas tree
in the gutter...

10:41.373 --> 10:44.275
And his crazy dog went out
and dragged it back
into the house.

10:48.580 --> 10:51.882
This is your nephew, Edith,
and it's your fault.

10:51.950 --> 10:55.286
Now, I want you to call
this Wendell on the phone
and tell him I wanna see him.

10:55.354 --> 10:57.988
Now?
All right, Archie.
Yes, now.

10:58.056 --> 11:01.091
Daddy, why don't you sit down
and eat your dinner?
'Cause I lost my appetite.

11:01.159 --> 11:03.761
Arch, what are you gettin'
so upset about?

11:03.828 --> 11:06.130
It's probably just a mistake.
If it's not, you know,

11:06.197 --> 11:08.466
I think
it's kind of ironic.
To which?

11:08.533 --> 11:10.468
I mean, think about it.

11:10.535 --> 11:13.103
Insurance company's
cuttin' you off
for no good reason,

11:13.171 --> 11:15.673
and tomorrow you're gonna
cut little Emmanuel off
for no good reason.

11:15.741 --> 11:18.342
You don't know that.
I don't know that myself.

11:18.410 --> 11:20.278
Oh, Archie,
from everything you've said--

11:20.345 --> 11:23.814
what I say
ain't got nothin' to do
with what I think.

11:26.184 --> 11:30.621
There's a lot of things
goin' on up here
that never come out my mouth.

11:30.689 --> 11:33.157
Now, just get away
from me.
Wendell isn't home,

11:33.224 --> 11:36.093
but I left a message for him
to call you back.

11:36.161 --> 11:38.362
Well, he better
call me back.

11:38.430 --> 11:41.031
Now, leave me alone,
huh, Edith?
I'm thinkin'.

11:41.099 --> 11:45.135
About firing elmo
or little Emmanuel?

11:45.203 --> 11:50.808
Yeah, Edith,
and about how to kill
your nephew Wendell.

11:58.283 --> 12:00.217
Let's see.

12:00.285 --> 12:05.690
Wendell is my sister's
husband's sister's son.

12:05.757 --> 12:07.891
Then he's really
a distant relative.

12:07.959 --> 12:11.261
Oh, yeah, he lives
way out in far rockaway.

12:14.333 --> 12:16.467
Wendell's mother and I...

12:16.535 --> 12:20.037
Used to play together
when we were little girls.

12:20.104 --> 12:22.039
You know what we did?

12:22.106 --> 12:26.444
Whenever we didn't have
any money for candy,
which was most of the time,

12:26.511 --> 12:29.847
we'd go into the candy store
and start a fight.

12:29.914 --> 12:32.717
Why, mom?
Oh, it wasn't a real fight.

12:32.784 --> 12:35.586
Wendell's mother
would make-believe
she was hitting me,

12:35.654 --> 12:38.255
and I would cry real loud.

12:38.323 --> 12:40.257
And then Mr. Solomon,
the owner,

12:40.325 --> 12:43.527
would give me a sweet
to make me stop cryin'.

12:43.595 --> 12:47.665
And then we'd run out
on the sidewalk
and divide the candy.

12:47.733 --> 12:50.167
Oh, ma.
Shame on you.

12:50.235 --> 12:53.871
Oh, yeah. Sometimes,
he'd only give me one sour ball,

12:53.938 --> 12:56.707
and that
would drive us crazy.

13:01.045 --> 13:03.681
Hey, arch, did you do it?
Did I do it?
Did I do it?

13:03.749 --> 13:06.717
That's a real polack question
if I ever heard one.

13:09.087 --> 13:13.123
And I'll give you
a polack answer:
I don't know.

13:13.191 --> 13:16.594
Edith.
How am I supposed to know
what you're talkin' about?

13:16.661 --> 13:20.063
Can't you ask me
an intelligent question?
I didn't wanna confuse you.

13:27.138 --> 13:31.375
Listen, meathead, any time
you ask me a straight question,
I'll give you a straight answer.

13:31.443 --> 13:33.176
Okay. Did you fire
stretch Cunningham?

13:33.244 --> 13:35.345
None of your damn business.

13:35.414 --> 13:38.516
Archie, I'm glad
you're home early,

13:38.583 --> 13:42.052
'cause Wendell called and says
he's comin' before dinner.
Yeah.

13:42.120 --> 13:45.289
Before is good, because
if I had to face the bum
on a full stomach,

13:45.356 --> 13:47.291
I'd probably "detergerate."

13:50.395 --> 13:52.329
Well, Wendell said
to tell you that...

13:52.397 --> 13:56.066
He couldn't stay long
'cause he's very busy.
<i>[ Doorbell ringing ]</i>

13:56.134 --> 13:59.336
Sure. He's probably
cancellin' polices
all over town.

13:59.404 --> 14:04.174
I'll get it.
You go tell Gloria
Wendell is here.

14:04.242 --> 14:07.177
Hello, Wendell!
Aunt Edith, is that you?

14:07.245 --> 14:11.582
I don't believe it.
Oh, you look beautiful.
Fantastic. Ravishing.

14:11.650 --> 14:15.753
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>This guy's shovelin'</i>
<i>with two hands.</i>

14:15.821 --> 14:18.288
Is that Uncle Archie?

14:18.356 --> 14:22.560
That is not Uncle Archie.
Yeah, that's Archie.

14:22.627 --> 14:24.562
How does he do it,
aunt Edith?

14:24.629 --> 14:27.130
How do you do it,
Uncle Archie? You're
the picture of health.

14:27.198 --> 14:29.934
'Cause my health insurance
ain't been cancelled.

14:30.001 --> 14:32.870
That's Archie, all right.
The same old sense of humor.

14:32.938 --> 14:34.872
And this must be
little Andrea.

14:34.940 --> 14:36.874
Gloria.
Yes.
Gloria.

14:36.942 --> 14:38.876
And this is my husband,
Michael stivic.

14:38.944 --> 14:42.179
Husband?
That means you're married.

14:45.383 --> 14:48.452
Will you excuse me? I have to
go upstairs and wash my hair.
Of course.

14:48.520 --> 14:50.521
And what beautiful hair
she has.

14:50.589 --> 14:52.623
Aunt Edith,
I just can't get over--
come on, Wendell.

14:52.691 --> 14:55.092
Quit grinding out
the baloney, huh?

14:55.159 --> 14:57.495
Edith,
sit down someplace.

14:57.562 --> 15:00.498
Listen, what's the meaning
of this here letter?

15:00.565 --> 15:04.502
Oh, yes.
This is our form 404.
<i>[ Doorbell ringing ]</i>

15:04.569 --> 15:06.670
Just sit down here,
huh?

15:06.738 --> 15:11.141
And stop tellin' Edith
how gorgeous she is, 'cause
we all know you're lyin'.

15:12.844 --> 15:15.846
What a sense of humor.
Hello, Archie.

15:15.914 --> 15:18.348
I hope you don't mind,
but I had to see you.

15:18.416 --> 15:20.551
Oh, hi, Emmanuel.

15:20.619 --> 15:24.889
I don't mean to bother you,
but it's something important.
I have to talk to you about it.

15:24.956 --> 15:27.290
Yeah, well, uh,
I'm kind of busy here--

15:27.358 --> 15:29.359
who is it, Archie?

15:29.427 --> 15:32.095
It's nobody, Edith.
It's little Emmanuel.

15:32.163 --> 15:35.966
Little Emmanuel?
Well, come in!

15:36.034 --> 15:38.268
I'm so glad to meet you.

15:38.336 --> 15:41.204
Look, everybody,
it's little Emmanuel.

15:41.272 --> 15:43.206
Won't you sit down?
Oh.

15:43.274 --> 15:46.877
This is my son-in-law,
Michael stivic,
and my nephew--

15:46.945 --> 15:48.879
come on. Come on.
Come on, Edith.

15:48.947 --> 15:52.950
You ain't entertaining
the mayor of Puerto Rico here.

15:53.018 --> 15:55.686
I think I know
what Emmanuel wants.

15:55.754 --> 15:58.989
Uh, while we're in here busy
talkin' over something else,
Emmanuel,

15:59.057 --> 16:00.824
you wouldn't mind
waitin' in the kitchen,
would ya?

16:00.892 --> 16:04.261
No.
And I'll get you
a drink while you wait.

16:04.328 --> 16:06.463
And then after that--

16:06.531 --> 16:08.732
go ahead, sit down.
Take a load off your foot.

16:15.106 --> 16:17.608
What do youse people
like to drink?
Pineapple juice?

16:17.676 --> 16:20.778
Oh, no.

16:20.845 --> 16:22.780
No, thank you.

16:22.847 --> 16:25.716
I got a bowl
of cold rice in here.

16:27.085 --> 16:29.119
No, nothing, nothing.
I got to go quick.

16:29.187 --> 16:31.822
Yeah, all right.
Well, there's some coffee
over there.

16:31.890 --> 16:34.257
Anytime you want it,
just help yourself, huh?

16:34.325 --> 16:36.827
<i>Archie, you did it!</i>
<i>I did what?</i>

16:36.895 --> 16:39.262
You fired
little Emmanuel.
I had to.

16:39.330 --> 16:41.098
You could've fired
stretch Cunningham.

16:41.165 --> 16:44.434
And get 60 white guys
on the job sore as hell at me?
Get out of here.

16:44.502 --> 16:48.105
Come on, arch. Why'd you have
to pick on little Emmanuel?
He's your best worker.

16:48.172 --> 16:50.708
There's colored guys
and white guys
workin' down here.

16:50.775 --> 16:53.443
He's the only puerto rican.
He'll never be missed.

16:53.511 --> 16:58.448
Archie,
you left little Emmanuel
alone in the kitchen.

16:58.516 --> 17:00.684
It's all right, Edith.
He ain't gonna steal nothin'.

17:02.420 --> 17:04.989
Now, listen,
let's get this 404--

17:05.056 --> 17:07.825
wait a minute.
What am I doin' here?
That's my chair.

17:07.892 --> 17:10.527
Get out of there!
Sit down over there.

17:12.396 --> 17:14.464
Now, start talkin'.
Well--

17:14.531 --> 17:18.167
hold it.
Why are you breathin' on me?

17:18.236 --> 17:21.204
I gotta breathe.
Breathe over there,
will ya?

17:22.573 --> 17:24.406
I want
my insurance back.

17:24.474 --> 17:26.777
Now, Archie, I'm afraid
it's not as simple as that.

17:26.845 --> 17:29.246
You see,
this little code listing
up here in the corner...

17:29.313 --> 17:32.182
Indicates you're
in what we call an h.R.N.

17:32.250 --> 17:35.585
H.R.N.?
What's that?
A "high-risk neighborhood."

17:35.654 --> 17:39.623
What is that?
Well, Uncle Archie--

17:39.691 --> 17:41.792
now, let me make this
perfectly clear.

17:43.494 --> 17:46.396
Where have I heard
that before?

17:48.432 --> 17:50.600
Dummy up, you.

17:50.669 --> 17:53.603
Go on. You were sayin'?
Your insurance
has not been cancelled.

17:53.672 --> 17:56.506
It's been
economically terminated.

17:56.574 --> 18:00.644
Wait a minute.
Don't terminatin' mean
the same thing as cancelled?

18:00.712 --> 18:04.314
Yes, but economically terminated
is a much nicer term,

18:04.382 --> 18:07.617
because it lets the client know
it's nothing he's done.

18:07.686 --> 18:09.853
Archie--
excuse me.

18:09.921 --> 18:12.790
Little Emmanuel is anxious
to speak to you.

18:12.857 --> 18:15.659
Edith, can't you pour him
some coffee out there?

18:15.727 --> 18:17.795
Yeah.
All right, Archie.

18:17.862 --> 18:21.165
Now, I ain't got
all night, Wendell,
so give it to me straight.

18:21.232 --> 18:24.134
Okay. Archie,

18:24.202 --> 18:27.537
you are a victim
of area displacement.

18:27.605 --> 18:29.539
What does that mean?

18:29.607 --> 18:32.009
I think it means
you didn't get it straight.

18:33.111 --> 18:35.212
Who asked you?

18:35.279 --> 18:37.414
Now, Wendell,
give it to me straight,

18:37.481 --> 18:39.449
or I punch you in the head.

18:42.386 --> 18:45.455
Archie, you have
a fabulous sense of humor.

18:45.523 --> 18:47.257
Archie, <i>por favor?</i>

18:47.325 --> 18:49.259
Yeah, pour some more.

18:57.936 --> 19:00.437
Now, come on, Wendell.
Okay.

19:00.504 --> 19:02.706
I have a map in here
which I think will clear
everything up.

19:02.774 --> 19:05.075
Yeah, well, we gotta get
everything cleared up.
May I put it over here?

19:05.143 --> 19:07.277
Put it right down
on the table.
Archie, please.

19:07.345 --> 19:09.279
All right,
take it easy, Emmanuel,
will ya?

19:09.347 --> 19:12.282
You get your stuff out,
and I'm gonna talk
to this guy in the kitchen.

19:12.350 --> 19:14.351
Get back in there.

19:14.418 --> 19:17.087
Edith-- Edith,
what are you doin' here?

19:17.155 --> 19:19.289
Go outside and sit
with your dopey nephew.

19:19.357 --> 19:22.159
Right away, Archie.
Now, listen, Emmanuel.

19:22.227 --> 19:24.694
I'm kind of rushed for time,
so, uh--

19:24.763 --> 19:29.332
what do you want from me?
Well, I want to talk to you
about me getting fired.

19:29.400 --> 19:32.435
Well, Emmanuel, uh,

19:32.503 --> 19:34.437
it's this way, see.

19:34.505 --> 19:36.807
You wasn't really fired.

19:36.875 --> 19:39.109
No?
[ Shouting in Spanish ]

19:41.679 --> 19:44.347

Sit down a minute.
Yeah!

19:46.417 --> 19:48.351
Don't kiss me no more!

19:50.255 --> 19:55.192
No. I mean,
y-y-you ain't got your job,

19:55.260 --> 19:57.961
I mean, you were what we call
in the business there,

19:58.029 --> 20:02.499
um, unfortunately terminated.

20:02.566 --> 20:04.701
What does that mean?

20:04.769 --> 20:06.703
Well, it's kind of like--
<i>Archie.</i>

20:06.771 --> 20:10.607
Why don't you tell him
the truth? It's kind of like
being fired, right?

20:10.675 --> 20:13.944
Don't listen to
the college boy up here.
He don't know nothin'.

20:14.012 --> 20:16.146
Yeah, but he's right.
I am fired.

20:16.214 --> 20:19.950
And I help you. You know
that. Now, why can't you
not help me no more?

20:20.018 --> 20:23.086
Well, gee, I mean,
I'd do anything I could,
Emmanuel,

20:23.154 --> 20:25.255
but I just can't
do nothin' about it.

20:25.323 --> 20:27.191
<i>Archie, I'm ready</i>
<i>with the map out here.</i>
<i>Hold it.</i>

20:27.258 --> 20:29.693
Stay here, will you?
This is important, now.
I'm sorry, Emmanuel.

20:29.760 --> 20:32.229
Don't give me
any arguments!

20:32.297 --> 20:34.364
Archie, look at this!
Now, what do we got here?

20:34.432 --> 20:36.666
Well, I think this'll
really explain everything.

20:36.734 --> 20:39.669
This is a detailed sectional map
of the whole area.

20:39.737 --> 20:43.606
Your neighborhood now extends
all the way down
to the river here,

20:43.674 --> 20:47.211
where a lot of, uh,
well, high-risk people live.

20:47.278 --> 20:49.346
Now, wait a minute.
What are you talkin' about,
the coloreds?

20:49.413 --> 20:51.648
- Black people.
- Whatever.

20:51.716 --> 20:54.684
We call them low income
socioeconomic groups.

20:54.752 --> 20:57.955
Yeah, everybody
calls 'em somethin'.

20:58.022 --> 21:00.324
Well, because they're officially
part of your area now,

21:00.391 --> 21:04.427
we've had to terminate
all the insurance
in this neighborhood.

21:04.495 --> 21:06.429
What are you tellin' me?
You're lumpin' me with them?

21:06.497 --> 21:08.431
What have I got to do with
coloreds and puerto ricans?

21:08.499 --> 21:11.801
It's got nothing to do
with that. But the boundary for
the high-risk neighborhood...

21:11.870 --> 21:14.905
Runs right along here,
and here's your house.

21:14.973 --> 21:17.140
My house is
right on the line.

21:17.208 --> 21:19.276
Yes, which makes it
part of the h.R.N.

21:19.344 --> 21:21.912
Now, if you only lived on
the other side of the line,

21:21.980 --> 21:24.581
in this house or this one--
hold it!

21:24.648 --> 21:28.051
This house right here
belongs to Jefferson,
and he's colored!

21:28.119 --> 21:30.220
But you still live
in the colored neighborhood.

21:30.288 --> 21:33.123
But this is
the colored guy!

21:33.191 --> 21:36.426
But he lives in
a low-risk neighborhood.

21:36.494 --> 21:40.063
- That's discrimination.
- That's discrimination!

21:40.131 --> 21:42.199
That's
the insurance business.

21:42.267 --> 21:45.335
Archie, can we talk now?
Wait a minute,
will you, Emmanuel?

21:45.403 --> 21:47.504
Well, I really must
be going myself.

21:47.571 --> 21:49.973
Uncle Archie, look,
I sympathize with you,

21:50.041 --> 21:52.976
but I'm just one man
in one little office.

21:53.044 --> 21:56.513
The decisions are made upstairs.
That's the way
the system operates.

21:56.580 --> 21:58.481
What can I do about it?

21:58.549 --> 22:02.219
You could do something about it
if you wanted to.
After all, your Edith's nephew.

22:02.287 --> 22:04.288
Why couldn't you go up
to the president
and say somethin'?

22:04.355 --> 22:06.290
Ain't you man enough
to do that?

22:08.126 --> 22:10.260
I'm really very sorry.

22:11.562 --> 22:13.496
Good night, all.

22:15.533 --> 22:18.035
And that's
the end of that!

22:18.102 --> 22:21.638
Archie?
Oh, Emmanuel, yeah.

22:21.705 --> 22:23.706
Are you sure there's
nothing you can do?

22:23.774 --> 22:26.543
Well, listen, Emmanuel.
I'm sorry to keep you
waitin' in there,

22:26.610 --> 22:29.313
but you gotta
believe me, see.

22:29.380 --> 22:32.015
I'd do somethin' for you,
but I can't. Listen.

22:32.083 --> 22:36.886
I'm only a little man, see?
These decisions are made
by-by the big men.

22:36.955 --> 22:40.090
Upstairs.
You know what I mean?
