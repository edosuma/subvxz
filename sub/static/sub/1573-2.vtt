<i>A flaw in the plan!
While in the middle of a heated battle,</i>

00:27.437 --> 00:31.608
<i>clone trooper Tup lost his
senses and killed a Jedi General.</i>

00:31.650 --> 00:33.860
<i>Seeming to have no awareness
of his actions,</i>

00:33.902 --> 00:36.988
<i>Tup's health began
to deteriorate rapidly.</i>

00:37.029 --> 00:39.616
<i>Fearing the illness was linked
to a Separatist plot,</i>

00:39.658 --> 00:43.912
<i>Anakin Skywalker has dispatched
Captain Rex and ARC Trooper 5555</i>

00:43.954 --> 00:46.873
<i>to escort Tup back to the
cloning facilities on Kamino</i>

00:46.915 --> 00:49.668
<i>for an intensive evaluation.</i>

01:21.533 --> 01:24.327
You will have to say good-bye
to your friend now.

01:24.369 --> 01:26.579
Yes, Doctor.

01:26.621 --> 01:28.122
General Shaak Ti.

01:28.164 --> 01:30.000
Captain Rex.

01:30.040 --> 01:32.293
Fives, am I correct?

01:32.335 --> 01:34.754
Yes, General.

01:34.796 --> 01:36.673
You've served with Tup?

01:36.715 --> 01:38.424
Yes.

01:38.466 --> 01:39.885
You must come with me.

01:39.926 --> 01:43.930
With...
with all due respect, General,

01:43.972 --> 01:45.724
I can't just abandon him now.

01:45.765 --> 01:48.018
You must let the doctors do their work.

01:48.059 --> 01:49.519
Do not be afraid.

01:49.561 --> 01:51.813
Your friend is in quite capable hands.

01:51.855 --> 01:55.107
Doctor Nala Se is the Chief
Medical Scientist on Kamino.

01:55.149 --> 01:58.528
She was one of the primary
engineers of all the clones.

01:58.570 --> 02:00.947
Now we must take care of you.

02:00.989 --> 02:02.448
Me?

02:02.490 --> 02:03.909
There's nothing wrong
with me, General.

02:03.950 --> 02:05.952
I'm perfectly fine.

02:05.994 --> 02:09.038
We can't be sure of that until
we've completed a full exam.

02:09.080 --> 02:11.541
If a virus was the cause
of Tup's breakdown,

02:11.583 --> 02:14.711
you have more than likely
been exposed to the contagion.

02:14.753 --> 02:17.923
You haven't entered the advance
stages yet, as Tup has,

02:17.964 --> 02:20.675
but any information
we can gather from you

02:20.717 --> 02:23.511
could help to find a cure for Tup.

02:23.553 --> 02:26.389
All right, General,
if it'll help Tup.

02:26.431 --> 02:29.601
Captain Rex, General Skywalker
has ordered you

02:29.642 --> 02:31.102
back to the war zone.

02:31.143 --> 02:33.063
You are to leave immediately.

02:33.104 --> 02:34.313
I'm sorry, Fives.

02:34.355 --> 02:37.067
I wish I could stay, but duty calls.

02:37.108 --> 02:38.443
It's fine, sir.

02:38.484 --> 02:40.570
Fighting a virus
is a nice change of pace

02:40.612 --> 02:41.947
from all those clankers.

02:41.988 --> 02:44.657
Take care of yourself...

02:44.699 --> 02:47.619
and Tup.

02:59.631 --> 03:02.258
Let's begin the tests.

03:02.300 --> 03:05.177
Administer the stimulant.

03:11.977 --> 03:13.895
Remove his mask.

03:20.276 --> 03:22.278
What are they doing to Tup?

03:22.320 --> 03:23.279
Remain calm.

03:23.321 --> 03:25.448
- Out of my way!
- Oh.

03:25.490 --> 03:27.951
Please return
to the examination table.

03:31.121 --> 03:33.623
His reactions are normal.

03:33.665 --> 03:36.292
What's going on?
General!

03:36.334 --> 03:37.752
General!

03:39.420 --> 03:40.797
No, no, no.

03:40.839 --> 03:42.507
Please return
to the examination table.

03:42.548 --> 03:45.093
<i>- Come on!
- Remain calm.</i>

03:45.135 --> 03:46.719
Please return
to the examin...

03:49.681 --> 03:51.641
His reaction will subside.

03:51.683 --> 03:55.436
The patient must be awake
for the next round of tests.

03:55.478 --> 03:58.481
I am not fond
of these hyper tests.

03:58.523 --> 04:01.317
Yes, but they do give us
all the information we need

04:01.359 --> 04:03.319
in a timely fashion.

04:05.697 --> 04:09.283
There does not seem to be any
sign of infection in the blood.

04:09.325 --> 04:11.161
How curious.

04:11.202 --> 04:14.330
The subject has tested negative
on all accounts.

04:14.372 --> 04:17.750
This clone seems to be
in perfect health.

04:17.791 --> 04:21.253
We must be missing something.

04:21.295 --> 04:24.507
Why am I here?

04:24.549 --> 04:27.301
Is he conscious?

04:27.343 --> 04:28.845
Follow orders.

04:28.887 --> 04:30.388
Kill Jedi.
Kill Jedi!

04:30.429 --> 04:32.515
Are you finished with your tests?

04:32.557 --> 04:33.766
For now.

04:33.808 --> 04:34.976
Sedate him.

04:35.018 --> 04:36.978
Yes, ma'am.

04:37.020 --> 04:40.190
Follow orders.
Follow orders.

04:40.231 --> 04:43.651
Follow orders.

04:43.693 --> 04:46.696
It appears this clone
has orders to kill a Jedi.

04:46.738 --> 04:50.783
Perhaps the Separatists
found a way to brainwash him.

04:50.825 --> 04:52.785
Look, is Tup going to be all right?

04:52.827 --> 04:54.037
Have they found anything out?

04:54.079 --> 04:56.206
Please sit down.

04:56.247 --> 04:57.832
We are using hyper tests,

04:57.874 --> 05:00.835
so we should be getting
the results very quickly.

05:00.877 --> 05:03.671
We need to complete
more procedures on you.

05:04.672 --> 05:06.465
- Sorry.
- Why?

05:06.507 --> 05:08.051
Ow! Hey!

05:08.093 --> 05:09.719
I said I was sorry.

05:09.761 --> 05:11.888
You must understand, organic beings

05:11.930 --> 05:14.599
are so much harder
to analyze than droids.

05:14.640 --> 05:15.934
<i>Well?</i>

05:15.975 --> 05:17.727
Everything seems normal.

05:17.769 --> 05:18.978
Oh, great.

05:19.020 --> 05:20.396
Well, that means they can let me out.

05:20.438 --> 05:22.565
I am afraid
that is not possible.

05:22.607 --> 05:23.983
You must remain quarantined

05:24.025 --> 05:25.735
until we have pinpointed
the exact cause

05:25.777 --> 05:27.403
of the other clone's breakdown.

05:27.445 --> 05:29.864
We cannot risk
any further casualties.

05:29.906 --> 05:33.243
Look, I am not a threat,
and neither is Tup.

05:33.284 --> 05:34.660
Are you certain?

05:34.702 --> 05:37.663
Eh.
You're just a droid.

05:37.705 --> 05:39.457
You don't know about real duty,

05:39.498 --> 05:41.793
about what it's like
to have a brother.

05:41.834 --> 05:43.753
I am sorry.

05:43.795 --> 05:47.924
I always wanted to have
human feelings, but I do not.

05:47.966 --> 05:49.759
Good-bye.

06:08.945 --> 06:12.991
Maybe whatever is causing
his aggression is psychological.

06:13.032 --> 06:15.493
It seems to be an isolated case.

06:15.534 --> 06:18.663
The other clone has yet
to display any symptoms.

06:30.340 --> 06:33.094
I need an answer now.

06:33.136 --> 06:35.805
This isn't just a physical
manifestation of psychosis.

06:35.847 --> 06:39.851
You must have missed
something.

06:39.892 --> 06:42.020
Might I suggest
a second brain scan,

06:42.061 --> 06:43.980
an atomic-level brain scan?

06:44.022 --> 06:45.523
This is unnecessary.

06:45.564 --> 06:48.442
The phase 1 and 2 scans
we did are sufficient.

06:48.484 --> 06:51.779
He's too weak for a phase 5
atomic-level scan.

06:51.821 --> 06:54.073
I calculate the beneficial
knowledge we could gain

06:54.115 --> 06:57.743
from a phase 5 atomic scan
is worth the risk.

06:57.785 --> 07:01.539
The only way to discover
what has happened to this clone

07:01.580 --> 07:03.208
is to terminate him

07:03.249 --> 07:05.835
and do a full-scale autopsy
on the molecular level.

07:05.877 --> 07:07.795
We must be cautious.

07:07.837 --> 07:09.672
<i>I do not believe
this is a physical ailment,</i>

07:09.714 --> 07:11.423
but a mental condition

07:11.465 --> 07:13.885
caused by possible
Separatist brainwashing.

07:13.926 --> 07:17.055
I do not agree.
This is a virus of some kind.

07:17.096 --> 07:19.807
I am in charge
of this examination,

07:19.849 --> 07:23.311
and I will decide
what is best for my patient.

07:23.353 --> 07:26.064
Actually, since
the Republic and the Jedi

07:26.105 --> 07:27.606
commissioned the clones,

07:27.648 --> 07:31.694
it is our responsibility
to oversee their care.

07:31.736 --> 07:34.239
Every clone
and their genetic makeup

07:34.280 --> 07:37.158
is property
of the Kaminoan government.

07:37.200 --> 07:40.912
<i>Now, as a client of ours,
I will respect your wishes,</i>

07:40.953 --> 07:43.706
but as to the fate
of this clone,

07:43.748 --> 07:46.876
I will speak to our
Prime Minister, Lama Su.

07:46.918 --> 07:49.420
And I will advise
the Jedi Council

07:49.461 --> 07:51.089
on the atomic brain scan

07:51.130 --> 07:53.591
and see how they
would like to proceed.

07:53.632 --> 07:55.634
Very well.

07:59.805 --> 08:01.557
- Hello.
- What's going on?

08:01.599 --> 08:06.354
CT-5385's condition
seems to be deteriorating.

08:06.396 --> 08:09.523
Tup.
His name is Tup.

08:09.565 --> 08:11.901
Tup?
What is a Tup?

08:11.943 --> 08:14.862
Tup is my friend.
He's not a number.

08:14.904 --> 08:17.448
Yes, he is.
We all have numbers.

08:17.489 --> 08:23.204
My number is
AZ-345211896246498721347.

08:23.246 --> 08:25.915
His number is CT-5385.

08:25.957 --> 08:28.167
Wrong.
He has a name.

08:28.209 --> 08:31.921
No clone uses a number, not anymore.

08:31.963 --> 08:35.758
But you are a number.
CT-5555.

08:35.799 --> 08:39.304
No, I am Fives.
Call me Fives.

08:39.345 --> 08:41.889
But five is a number.

08:41.931 --> 08:44.809
No, not five,
Fives.

08:44.850 --> 08:46.727
Oh.

08:46.769 --> 08:48.771
The difference is minimal.

08:48.813 --> 08:52.650
Not to me and not to any clone.

08:56.446 --> 08:59.073
It appears there has been
a preemptive execution

08:59.115 --> 09:02.660
of clone protocol 66.

09:02.701 --> 09:04.954
How did this happen?

09:04.996 --> 09:06.872
I do not know as of yet.

09:06.914 --> 09:10.042
However, I recommend
we terminate the clone

09:10.084 --> 09:11.752
and do a full autopsy

09:11.794 --> 09:15.465
to discover how the inhibitor
chip was activated.

09:15.506 --> 09:17.883
And what of the Jedi?

09:17.925 --> 09:23.306
The Jedi Shaak Ti is proposing
an atomic-level brain scan.

09:23.348 --> 09:25.141
She has gone to the Jedi Council

09:25.183 --> 09:29.020
to seek their approval
before proceeding.

09:29.061 --> 09:33.024
We must contact Lord Tyranus.

09:47.746 --> 09:50.666
I've been expecting your transmission.

09:50.708 --> 09:53.585
I have heard
of the malfunctioning clone.

09:53.627 --> 09:55.838
How widespread is the problem?

09:55.880 --> 09:59.217
It seems to be an isolated incident.

09:59.258 --> 10:03.721
However, this is a delicate situation.

10:03.762 --> 10:07.183
We need to terminate the clone
as soon as possible

10:07.225 --> 10:10.644
in order to extract and analyze
the inhibitor chip

10:10.686 --> 10:12.604
that you provided to us.

10:12.646 --> 10:14.106
Very good.

10:14.148 --> 10:16.526
Terminate the clone immediately.

10:16.567 --> 10:20.363
However, send the chip to me
for analysis.

10:20.405 --> 10:22.740
And what if the Jedi
ask for the chip

10:22.781 --> 10:25.493
and the results
of the autopsy?

10:25.535 --> 10:27.203
You must remember

10:27.245 --> 10:29.747
the chip is a safeguard
against betrayal

10:29.788 --> 10:31.541
from rogue Jedi.

10:31.582 --> 10:36.754
Master Syfo-Dias was
the only Jedi who knew of this.

10:36.795 --> 10:40.425
But with his passing,
we alone know of this secret,

10:40.466 --> 10:43.094
and you must keep it that way.

10:43.135 --> 10:46.805
Yes, Lord Tyranus.

10:46.847 --> 10:50.101
These Jedi are a curious cult.

10:50.142 --> 10:52.895
Too spiritual for my taste.

10:52.937 --> 10:56.399
I will terminate the clone immediately.

10:56.441 --> 11:00.361
The Kaminoans have suggested
that we terminate the clone

11:00.403 --> 11:04.156
and do a rigorous molecular
autopsy to discover the virus.

11:04.198 --> 11:06.700
I believe this solution
is ill-advised.

11:06.742 --> 11:10.329
My belief is that Tup has been
brainwashed by the Separatists

11:10.371 --> 11:13.791
using some new process
we do not yet understand.

11:13.832 --> 11:16.668
Brainwashing?
How could that be possible?

11:16.710 --> 11:20.172
General Skywalker reported Tup
missing on Ringo Vinda,

11:20.214 --> 11:23.259
<i>but after five rotations,
he turned up again.</i>

11:23.301 --> 11:26.220
That event preceded
this episode.

11:26.262 --> 11:29.474
Perhaps he was compromised
at that point.

11:29.515 --> 11:32.226
We must find the truth
behind this situation,

11:32.268 --> 11:36.355
or we could find many more
clones turned against us.

11:36.397 --> 11:39.275
I would like to implement
a level five atomic brain scan

11:39.317 --> 11:42.861
to see if his thought processes
are still functioning normally.

11:42.903 --> 11:45.406
And what do the Kaminoans
think of that?

11:45.448 --> 11:48.826
They feel Tup is so weak,
the level five atomic brain scan

11:48.867 --> 11:52.497
will damage his neural tissue
and possibly kill him.

11:52.538 --> 11:54.873
Their approach would be
to terminate him,

11:54.915 --> 11:58.961
thus leaving the brain
fully intact for the autopsy.

11:59.003 --> 12:01.506
Bring clone trooper Tup
back to the Jedi Temple.

12:01.547 --> 12:02.840
Yes.

12:02.881 --> 12:04.967
Examine him with the Force we shall,

12:05.009 --> 12:08.095
and unravel this mystery we will.

12:08.137 --> 12:12.224
Yes, Master.
I'll bring him back immediately.

12:16.312 --> 12:17.687
No.

12:17.729 --> 12:19.607
There's too much procedure
and protocol here.

12:19.649 --> 12:22.527
Tup is a soldier,
he risks his life every day,

12:22.568 --> 12:24.736
and I know he would risk it now

12:24.778 --> 12:27.448
if it meant finding a cure
for what's wrong with him.

12:27.490 --> 12:30.034
I recommended an atomic brain scan,

12:30.075 --> 12:32.495
but that request
has thus far been denied.

12:32.537 --> 12:34.205
Then we have to get

12:34.246 --> 12:37.416
the results of that
brain scan ourselves.

12:37.458 --> 12:39.793
But that is against protocol.

12:39.835 --> 12:41.379
Think about it.

12:41.420 --> 12:44.382
It's your duty to save
the patient, right?

12:44.423 --> 12:45.841
That is correct.

12:45.883 --> 12:48.386
And you recommended
this atomic brain scan

12:48.427 --> 12:51.389
as the best way to save
the patient, right?

12:51.430 --> 12:52.640
That is correct.

12:52.682 --> 12:56.810
So, by not performing this scan,

12:56.852 --> 13:00.523
you're letting the
patient die, willingly.

13:00.565 --> 13:04.443
Impossible.
That is against my programming.

13:04.485 --> 13:07.238
That's not the way
it looks to me.

13:07.279 --> 13:11.158
I cannot perform the atomic brain
scan without disobeying orders.

13:11.200 --> 13:12.577
Check your programming.

13:12.618 --> 13:15.246
I thought saving the patient
at all costs

13:15.287 --> 13:18.082
was fundamentally
your highest order.

13:18.123 --> 13:19.749
You are correct.

13:19.791 --> 13:22.670
Right.
Then let's get to it.

13:26.632 --> 13:28.634
Quickly.

13:45.067 --> 13:47.653
Okay.

13:47.695 --> 13:49.321
Let's get to work.

14:20.185 --> 14:22.647
The scan is almost complete.

14:27.610 --> 14:29.570
Everything appears to be normal.

14:29.612 --> 14:32.906
Wait a second.

14:32.948 --> 14:34.659
What?
What is it?

14:34.700 --> 14:39.121
It appears this clone
has developed a tumor.

14:39.163 --> 14:41.499
Is that even possible?

14:41.540 --> 14:45.586
I have never witnessed
anything like this in your kind.

14:45.628 --> 14:47.546
Then...
what is it?

14:47.588 --> 14:49.674
I cannot be sure
without a biopsy.

14:49.715 --> 14:51.342
You're gonna
take it out of him?

14:56.597 --> 14:58.056
What was that?

14:58.098 --> 14:59.933
Do you think anybody
heard that?

14:59.975 --> 15:03.895
The probability that somebody
heard that is high, yes.

15:10.736 --> 15:12.780
<i>It came from this room.</i>

15:20.245 --> 15:21.789
Hello, Doctor.

15:21.831 --> 15:23.666
What do you think
you're doing?

15:23.708 --> 15:26.043
I was only following protocol.

15:26.084 --> 15:27.753
Save the patient.

15:38.180 --> 15:42.852
Doctor, I have found something
unusual in this scan.

15:42.893 --> 15:44.770
<i>It appears to be a tumor.</i>

15:44.812 --> 15:46.772
Perhaps you should
take a look.

15:46.814 --> 15:51.068
You performed a second scan
without my authorization?

15:51.109 --> 15:54.363
As I stated, I was following
my programming.

15:55.614 --> 15:57.991
Then you are like this clone...

15:58.033 --> 16:00.494
defective.

16:00.536 --> 16:04.248
You will be put on
report for deactivation.

16:07.376 --> 16:09.253
But the tumor...

16:09.294 --> 16:11.839
this tumor seems
to be blocking neuro-impulses

16:11.881 --> 16:13.883
from communicating
within the brain.

16:13.924 --> 16:15.676
We should scan the rest
of the clones

16:15.718 --> 16:17.969
to see if this is a problem
with their base genetic model

16:18.011 --> 16:20.347
or a mutation
with the current models.

16:20.389 --> 16:24.017
There is no tumor.
Your scan is incorrect.

16:24.059 --> 16:26.395
- But...
- This clone clearly has a virus

16:26.437 --> 16:28.731
that remains undetected,

16:28.773 --> 16:32.359
but I will find the cause
once he's terminated.

16:32.401 --> 16:34.403
Now leave.

16:46.874 --> 16:50.168
I can't believe it.
They're going to kill him.

16:50.210 --> 16:53.881
In a case like this, it is
the logical course of action.

16:53.923 --> 16:55.382
No, no.

16:55.424 --> 16:57.718
We were not created to be
disposed of this way.

16:57.760 --> 17:00.888
Perhaps you were.

17:00.930 --> 17:03.682
CT-5385 will be terminated

17:03.724 --> 17:05.893
so that others like him could survive.

17:05.935 --> 17:08.686
There aren't others like him!

17:08.729 --> 17:11.732
Tup doesn't have to die.
You found a tumor.

17:11.773 --> 17:14.151
I'm sure that's the cause of all this.

17:14.192 --> 17:16.236
It's the only thing that makes sense.

17:16.278 --> 17:19.490
But how can we proceed?
Do your biopsy.

17:19.531 --> 17:22.910
I'm sure what you find will
prove Tup does not have to die.

17:22.952 --> 17:24.578
But Nala Se does not believe...

17:24.619 --> 17:25.746
We're not going to Nala Se

17:25.788 --> 17:27.580
with whatever you find.

17:27.623 --> 17:30.501
We'll go to the General, to Shaak Ti.

17:30.542 --> 17:31.919
She helped me once as a cadet.

17:31.961 --> 17:34.713
I know she values the life of a clone.

17:34.755 --> 17:37.424
But we will be disobeying
direct orders.

17:37.466 --> 17:39.927
Yep, for the second time today.

17:39.969 --> 17:42.346
Can you hack into
the medical center's mainframe?

17:42.387 --> 17:45.056
I do possess that ability, yes.

17:45.098 --> 17:46.642
All right.

17:46.684 --> 17:48.978
Well, here's what you need to do.

17:55.901 --> 17:58.529
It will be a painless death.

17:58.570 --> 18:01.907
Soon, all our questions
will be answered.

18:04.368 --> 18:06.286
You may proceed.

18:06.328 --> 18:09.456
Hurry.
You got it? Are you in?

18:09.498 --> 18:11.375
Got it.

18:11.416 --> 18:13.502
<i>Intruder alert.</i>

18:13.544 --> 18:15.880
<i>Intruder alert.
All nonessential personnel</i>

18:15.921 --> 18:18.716
<i>report to a safe room for lockdown.</i>

18:29.184 --> 18:31.645
Master Jedi.
Status report?

18:31.687 --> 18:34.773
Scanners have picked
up an intruder in section C-6,

18:34.815 --> 18:37.026
but we have no visual confirmation.

18:37.067 --> 18:39.486
It could be the enemy
looking for our patient.

18:39.528 --> 18:42.865
I'm on my way.
Please report to a secure room.

18:47.036 --> 18:48.996
Ha!
Good work, AZ.

18:49.038 --> 18:52.416
You better get started before
they figure out it's a false alarm.

18:52.457 --> 18:54.710
Right away.

19:20.444 --> 19:23.113
You might want to turn away
for this part.

19:37.168 --> 19:38.712
I want a report.

19:38.754 --> 19:40.130
It appears to be a false alarm,

19:40.171 --> 19:41.840
triggered from the medical bay.

19:41.882 --> 19:43.467
Medical bay?

19:43.508 --> 19:46.053
It's Fives.
Come on.

19:49.932 --> 19:51.308
Is it done?

19:56.855 --> 19:58.273
It is now.

20:04.071 --> 20:05.739
What have you done?

20:05.781 --> 20:07.658
We've saved my friend's life.

20:07.699 --> 20:10.243
This tumor is the cause
of his illness.

20:10.285 --> 20:12.663
Give me that!

20:12.704 --> 20:15.958
You can't be trusted.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.918
<i>Stand down, trooper.</i>

20:17.960 --> 20:19.294
<i>General!</i>

20:19.336 --> 20:21.839
I have evidence.
It's right here.

20:21.880 --> 20:24.257
<i>I'm free.</i>

20:24.299 --> 20:25.676
<i>The mission...
Free...</i>

20:25.717 --> 20:27.511
- Tup?
<i>- The mission... Free.</i>

20:27.552 --> 20:29.471
The mission.

20:29.513 --> 20:31.098
What is he saying?

20:31.140 --> 20:34.267
Brother, what mission?

20:34.309 --> 20:37.104
You...
you know the one.

20:37.146 --> 20:41.441
<i>The... the mission,
the one in our dreams...</i>

20:41.483 --> 20:43.068
<i>that never ends.</i>

20:43.110 --> 20:45.863
The one in our dreams...

20:45.904 --> 20:48.657
Oh, brother.

20:53.411 --> 20:55.413
This is the end.

20:55.455 --> 20:59.292
Forget the mission.

20:59.334 --> 21:01.628
Oh, the nightmare.

21:01.670 --> 21:05.883
I'm...
free.

21:05.924 --> 21:08.677
No. No.

21:10.012 --> 21:12.764
I thought I saved him.

21:18.103 --> 21:23.316
<i>Sir, the clone CT-5385 has died.</i>

21:23.358 --> 21:26.070
Such a tragedy.

21:26.111 --> 21:28.655
<i>I recommend we do
further tests on this tumor</i>

21:28.697 --> 21:32.159
<i>at the Jedi Temple to see if
it is the cause of the problem.</i>

21:32.201 --> 21:34.494
Or even better, have the tumor sent

21:34.536 --> 21:38.957
to the Grand Republic Medical
Facility here on Coruscant.

21:38.999 --> 21:44.421
<i>- The Jedi Council requested the clone.
- I think the Chancellor is correct.</i>

21:44.462 --> 21:47.049
<i>The Grand Medical Facility
is state-of-the-art.</i>

21:47.091 --> 21:51.428
<i>If we are to find an answer to
this puzzle, we will find it there.</i>

21:51.469 --> 21:56.307
- We are in agreement, then?
- Yes, sir.
