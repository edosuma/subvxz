WEBVTT

01:14.825 --> 01:16.202
Beginning stage one countdown.

01:16.285 --> 01:18.829
T-minus-five minutes and counting.

01:18.913 --> 01:20.641
It should be
a picture-perfect launch, Mr. Winchell.

01:20.665 --> 01:22.541
It better be, Mr. Fong.

01:22.625 --> 01:24.752
That's a billion-dollar satellite
out there.

01:29.048 --> 01:30.048
Ah.

01:30.549 --> 01:32.426
Feels like a steam bath.

01:38.975 --> 01:40.434
Interior temp's just spiked.

01:40.518 --> 01:41.852
Shut down the launch sequence.

01:43.396 --> 01:45.982
It's not responding.
Something's gone wrong with the relays.

01:47.441 --> 01:48.901
Four minutes left.

01:50.695 --> 01:52.363
And I'm right on schedule.

01:53.906 --> 01:55.658
<i>80 Where does the old man
go to unwind?</i>

01:55.741 --> 01:58.661
Tibet. He's visiting
some old guru-mentor friend.

01:58.744 --> 02:00.037
He's got 'em all over the place.

02:00.121 --> 02:03.207
Perfect, you could take Dana out
to that cozy restaurant on the beach.

02:03.457 --> 02:04.834
Can't. Gotta work.

02:04.917 --> 02:07.044
You know, you're skating
on thin ice with her already.

02:07.128 --> 02:08.045
<i>You don't get it.</i>

02:08.129 --> 02:09.940
He expects me to work
even harder while he's gone.

02:09.964 --> 02:10.965
Why?

02:11.048 --> 02:12.609
He always thinks
something bad's gonna happen

02:12.633 --> 02:14.510
the minute he leaves town.

02:14.593 --> 02:15.845
And somehow he's always right.

02:28.107 --> 02:29.275
Inque!

02:29.358 --> 02:31.819
Last time I saw you,
you were washed away in a storm.

02:31.902 --> 02:34.613
And now
I'm rainwater fresh, Batman.

02:34.864 --> 02:36.699
Soon to be ice water.

02:39.285 --> 02:40.285
Oh!

02:51.797 --> 02:53.341
What the heck was that?

02:53.424 --> 02:55.384
A new technique, Batman.

02:55.593 --> 02:58.763
Did you think I'd learned nothing
from our previous encounters?

03:06.562 --> 03:08.147
You should have
minded your own...

03:14.070 --> 03:15.571
New circuitry, Inque.

03:15.654 --> 03:18.240
Did you think I'd learned nothing
from our previous encounters?

03:18.324 --> 03:20.743
I really don't have time
for this, Batman.

03:35.758 --> 03:36.967
No!

03:45.810 --> 03:46.894
Blastoff.

04:36.152 --> 04:37.653
Inque's a mercenary.

04:37.736 --> 04:39.923
If I'm going to find her,
I gotta figure out who hired her.

04:39.947 --> 04:43.200
- You gonna contact the old man?
- No. Inque's mine.

04:43.284 --> 04:45.369
Sounds like you two
have some kind of history.

04:46.662 --> 04:48.164
She was in the Batcave once.

04:48.247 --> 04:49.790
That's more than I can say.

04:50.749 --> 04:52.168
Sorry. Go on.

04:52.251 --> 04:54.712
It was my fault.
Wayne had to capture her.

04:54.795 --> 04:58.382
When she escaped, I went after her,
and Wayne had to rescue me again.

04:58.466 --> 05:00.092
Almost got himself killed.

05:00.176 --> 05:02.178
That's not gonna happen this time.

05:02.261 --> 05:03.762
I'll take care of Inque myself.

05:04.555 --> 05:06.765
Of course, if someone else
wanted to help me,

05:06.849 --> 05:09.894
say by digging up some information
about Shimano's competitors?

05:09.977 --> 05:12.563
If I do, do I get to see the Batcave?

05:20.613 --> 05:23.949
We have no choice but to scrap
the whole satellite project.

05:24.033 --> 05:25.659
Yes, we're all disappointed.

05:25.743 --> 05:27.453
It's a great loss for our company.

05:29.121 --> 05:32.541
It's only a loss
until your insurance company pays up.

05:32.625 --> 05:35.085
Then it'll be more like a profit.

05:35.169 --> 05:37.838
And speaking of profit,
I assume you're here

05:37.922 --> 05:40.966
for the remainder
of your own substantial fee?

05:42.301 --> 05:45.179
Here are the routing numbers
for my offshore account.

05:48.974 --> 05:50.267
This shouldn't take long.

05:50.351 --> 05:54.772
All I have to do is hit this one key
and half my assets become yours.

05:54.855 --> 05:57.149
Or I could keep it all for myself.

06:01.153 --> 06:03.989
Yes. I prefer the second option.

06:06.951 --> 06:08.953
Your resilience is remarkable.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.955
But this is no ordinary laser.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.332
It's a particle destabilizer.

06:13.415 --> 06:15.584
No substance is impervious.

06:18.837 --> 06:20.089
Not even you.

06:49.493 --> 06:51.579
My car.
What are you doing to my car?

06:52.371 --> 06:55.165
You're six months behind
on the payments. We're repossessing.

06:55.249 --> 06:57.126
Wait, this is just
some kind of oversight.

06:57.209 --> 06:58.877
I can pay. Really.

07:06.218 --> 07:07.720
Over limit.

07:07.970 --> 07:09.013
Try this one.

07:11.140 --> 07:12.141
Sorry.

07:15.519 --> 07:19.940
Over limit. Over limit.
Over limit. Over limit.

07:20.274 --> 07:21.734
Here, this one's brand-new.

07:32.661 --> 07:35.414
Oh, poor little repo man.
Don't look so sad.

07:35.581 --> 07:37.374
I'm sure you'll find other cars.

07:37.666 --> 07:40.210
- What's this?
- You got a problem, lady.

07:40.628 --> 07:43.922
Credit counselor?
I don't need a credit counselor.

07:44.173 --> 07:45.716
What I need is more credit.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.435
Hello?

07:56.685 --> 07:58.062
Oh, it's you.

07:58.437 --> 08:00.557
Listen, I know I promised
to make a payment this week,

08:00.648 --> 08:01.774
but something came up.

08:01.857 --> 08:04.276
But what if we transfer
the balance to the new card,

08:04.360 --> 08:06.487
then use the old card
to cover the overdraft?

08:06.904 --> 08:09.281
See? I told you we could work it out.

08:16.872 --> 08:18.123
No. Wait.

08:22.044 --> 08:23.044
Aah!

08:24.380 --> 08:25.547
Let me go.

08:25.631 --> 08:27.132
I need your help.

08:27.216 --> 08:28.592
What are you?

08:29.176 --> 08:30.219
I'm your mother.

08:36.975 --> 08:38.602
I was young.

08:38.686 --> 08:42.064
Younger than you are now.
The police were after me.

08:42.314 --> 08:43.440
I had to run.

08:43.524 --> 08:45.401
Why didn't you take me with you?

08:45.484 --> 08:48.529
I couldn't.
You were only a baby.

08:48.612 --> 08:51.365
But I made sure
I always sent money to your guardians.

08:51.448 --> 08:54.243
They told me my trust fund
was an inheritance.

08:54.618 --> 08:56.912
I never thought
I was living on stolen money.

08:57.079 --> 08:59.456
That money put a roof over your head.

08:59.540 --> 09:02.042
You had new clothes, enough to eat.

09:02.126 --> 09:03.961
That's more than I ever had as a child.

09:04.211 --> 09:06.964
Is that why you let them
turn you into a biohazard?

09:07.047 --> 09:08.757
- For money?
- Yes.

09:09.341 --> 09:10.634
For money.

09:10.718 --> 09:12.845
More money than you can imagine.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.519
Do you have some time after school?

09:20.602 --> 09:22.104
Some of us are going over to Rhino's,

09:22.187 --> 09:24.481
and I thought it would be nice
to just hang for a change.

09:27.276 --> 09:28.527
I'll make time.

09:29.611 --> 09:30.904
Great.

09:30.988 --> 09:32.906
I didn't know Max was in this class.

09:32.990 --> 09:34.116
Max?

09:38.579 --> 09:40.789
I borrowed the new Ditto Boys disk
from her yesterday.

09:40.873 --> 09:42.082
Guess she wants it back.

09:45.544 --> 09:47.171
- What you got?
- Not much.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.840
No one was really competing
with Shimano on this project.

09:49.923 --> 09:52.092
If the competition didn't hire Inque,
then who did?

09:52.176 --> 09:54.762
Maybe someone should have
a closer look at Shimano's books.

09:54.845 --> 09:56.221
I guess I could hack into their...

09:56.305 --> 09:57.532
I'm talking about the kind of looking

09:57.556 --> 09:59.641
that has to be done
up close and personal.

10:01.310 --> 10:02.770
Ah, slag.

10:02.853 --> 10:04.573
I told Dana
I'd go with you guys to Rhino's.

10:04.605 --> 10:06.648
Don't worry about it.
I'll explain to Dana.

10:08.859 --> 10:12.446
Let me guess. He's been summoned
by the great Mr. Wayne again?

10:12.780 --> 10:15.240
- Poor guy.
- You're not mad?

10:15.324 --> 10:17.785
Not since I figured out
what's really going on.

10:26.877 --> 10:29.505
I'm back. Thought I'd
pick something up for dinner.

10:29.797 --> 10:31.924
You know, if you're planning on
staying for a while,

10:32.007 --> 10:34.384
I could use some help
with the grocery bill.

10:34.468 --> 10:36.637
I've been a little
over-extended lately and...

10:39.973 --> 10:42.476
- You don't look so good.
- It's getting worse.

10:42.559 --> 10:44.686
There must be some cellular damage.

10:45.270 --> 10:47.731
The only thing that'll
help me heal is more mutagen.

10:47.815 --> 10:49.441
You'll have to get it for me.

10:49.525 --> 10:51.985
You mean steal it? I'm not a thief.

10:52.069 --> 10:54.571
I'll talk you through it.
We'll do it together.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.615
I don't know.

10:56.698 --> 10:58.700
I've never done anything
like this before.

10:58.784 --> 11:00.661
I need this, Deanna.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.287
I need you.

11:04.915 --> 11:05.999
Okay.

11:06.083 --> 11:07.668
The lab is in the Montrose District.

11:07.751 --> 11:10.921
You'll have to drive there,
though I wouldn't park too close.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.549
Maybe I should rent a car.
Mine's kind of conspicuous.

11:13.632 --> 11:16.051
Smart girl. Thinking ahead.

11:16.134 --> 11:18.220
I'II transfer some creds
into your account...

11:20.013 --> 11:22.057
It's all right.
I'll do it for you, Mother.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.142
I just need the transfer codes
and a PIN number.

11:24.226 --> 11:27.437
You know, that's the first time
you've called me "Mother."

12:11.231 --> 12:12.149
Inque.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.484
Well, call
the insurance adjuster again.

12:14.568 --> 12:18.280
This time, tell him if there's
any more delay settling our claim,

12:18.363 --> 12:20.741
he can expect to hear from our lawyer.

12:20.824 --> 12:23.410
Your lawyer might be too busy
with your criminal case.

12:23.493 --> 12:25.996
Where's the rest of her?

12:26.079 --> 12:29.082
If I tell you, then what?
You'll give me the sample?

12:29.166 --> 12:31.501
No, I'll still turn you in
to the cops for insurance fraud.

12:31.793 --> 12:33.128
But I'll be nice about it.

12:33.211 --> 12:35.297
Not a very compelling choice.

12:43.263 --> 12:44.514
Get him!

12:49.061 --> 12:50.061
Aah!

13:17.464 --> 13:18.507
We'll handle this.

13:24.638 --> 13:26.556
You saw the splatters
on the wall.

13:26.640 --> 13:30.686
If it did that to Inque,
imagine what it will do to you.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.497
I know you're in here.

13:54.292 --> 13:55.669
Show yourself.

14:06.722 --> 14:09.933
Now, where is Inque?

14:10.017 --> 14:10.934
I don't know.

14:11.018 --> 14:12.144
Wrong answer.

14:15.063 --> 14:16.815
No, really, I don't know!

14:16.898 --> 14:19.151
She was hurt, badly.
She got away.

14:19.234 --> 14:20.569
How do you contact her?

14:20.652 --> 14:23.113
I don't. She always contacts me.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.906
Her payment's done by e-transfers.

14:27.951 --> 14:30.071
Then you would have
her account numbers, wouldn't you?

14:30.203 --> 14:31.288
Uh-huh.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.294
I'm on my way
to the mutagenics lab.

14:37.753 --> 14:40.231
If Inque's really that badly injured,
she gonna need more mutagen.

14:40.255 --> 14:41.495
You track down the account yet?

14:41.548 --> 14:43.258
Genius can't be rushed, you know.

14:43.425 --> 14:45.343
So how mad was Dana
that I blew off our date?

14:45.427 --> 14:47.596
Actually, she wasn't mad at all.

14:47.679 --> 14:51.016
Said she understands
the special nature of your job.

14:51.099 --> 14:52.434
What? She found out?

14:52.517 --> 14:56.104
Relax, she was talking
about your relationship with Mr. Wayne.

14:56.188 --> 14:57.814
<i>She says that with your dad being gone,</i>

14:57.898 --> 15:00.317
<i>it was important for you
to have a positive father figure.</i>

15:00.400 --> 15:02.319
Bruce Wayne. Some father figure.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.321
Maybe she's not so far off.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.239
Hold on. Here it is.

15:06.323 --> 15:08.116
Traced it to a European bank.

15:08.200 --> 15:11.036
Lots of big electronic deposits.
Her fees, I guess.

15:12.496 --> 15:14.664
And monthly transfers
to an account in Gotham.

15:14.831 --> 15:16.500
- <i>Whose?</i>
- Checking.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.003
Genius or not, you'd better hurry.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.547
Looks like someone
just broke into the lab.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.510
Never fear.
I got the transfer info.

15:26.593 --> 15:29.888
It's a trust account
for someone named Deanna Clay.

15:46.238 --> 15:47.614
Deanna?

15:48.240 --> 15:49.991
Not looking too healthy, Inque.

15:50.075 --> 15:52.160
Healthy enough to take care of you.

16:18.562 --> 16:19.855
It's all ready, Mother.

16:20.647 --> 16:21.898
Catch.

16:22.440 --> 16:23.567
No!

16:31.658 --> 16:32.951
Ah!

16:33.869 --> 16:35.537
That's more like it.

16:39.583 --> 16:41.126
Feels like a tickle now.

17:01.354 --> 17:02.480
Ah!

17:27.547 --> 17:29.216
You never learn, do you?

18:04.584 --> 18:06.544
- Is he dead?
- Close enough.

18:19.766 --> 18:22.560
You just don't know
when to give up, do you, Batman?

18:33.321 --> 18:34.823
What did you do?

18:34.906 --> 18:36.157
What was in that mutagen?

18:38.535 --> 18:40.203
Penteral. It's a solvent.

18:41.162 --> 18:42.580
You're dissolving, Mother.

18:42.664 --> 18:45.333
Why? Why would you do this to me?

18:45.959 --> 18:48.420
For the money.
I have your accounts.

18:48.712 --> 18:50.213
And you're right.

18:50.297 --> 18:52.173
It is more money
than I could ever imagine.

18:55.927 --> 18:56.927
Aah!

19:05.228 --> 19:07.439
After all I gave you,

19:07.522 --> 19:09.941
how could you have turned out like this?

19:10.358 --> 19:13.153
You never gave me anything
except money, Mother.

19:13.236 --> 19:14.988
How did you expect me to turn out?

19:28.710 --> 19:30.086
Thank you, Simmons.

19:30.337 --> 19:31.463
That will be all for now.

19:35.925 --> 19:37.385
I said that will be all for...

19:38.261 --> 19:39.888
Oh, it's you.

19:39.971 --> 19:41.639
You're a bigger pest than the cops.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.141
They'll get you soon enough.

19:43.224 --> 19:45.727
You're blocking my sun.
What do you want?

19:45.810 --> 19:48.563
When Inque dissolved away,
the police collected her residue.

19:48.855 --> 19:51.399
Now that seems to have
mysteriously disappeared.

19:51.483 --> 19:53.485
Why should I care? She's dead.

19:53.568 --> 19:54.778
She's been dead before.
