00:16.485 --> 00:19.045
Ben? Well, come in. Long time, no see!

00:19.125 --> 00:22.445
-Rach, Ben's here. He's back from China!
-Ben!

00:23.085 --> 00:25.925
-Oh!
-Ahhh!

00:26.805 --> 00:28.205
I thought we'd go for a spin.

00:28.285 --> 00:30.405
-We have got a lot of catching up to do!
-OK!

00:31.965 --> 00:33.005
I'm just...

00:34.965 --> 00:37.885
China was <i>not </i>like I expected.

00:37.965 --> 00:41.965
Worked for Ling's dad in the Triads,
complete horror show.

00:42.645 --> 00:45.845
-We fell out, actually.
-Is that how you got the scar?

00:45.925 --> 00:49.165
Weird story. Don't like to talk about it.

00:49.845 --> 00:52.925
So, after all this time, here we are.

00:53.005 --> 00:55.525
-I have to say--
-No, let me go first.

00:55.605 --> 00:57.085
I'm not the Rachel that you knew before.

00:57.165 --> 00:59.085
I really don't think
we should be friends again.

00:59.165 --> 01:02.085
-Really? Why?
-I don't think it's good for you.

01:02.165 --> 01:03.885
-But--
-I've got things to do, Ben.

01:03.965 --> 01:06.565
I've got big things
and I have not got the time.

01:06.645 --> 01:08.245
-Rachel--
-I know what you're going to say.

01:08.325 --> 01:11.645
-I mean, come on, who are we kidding?
-I've got a girlfriend!

01:12.765 --> 01:15.605
-What?
-Her name's Tash, she's amazing.

01:15.685 --> 01:19.165
She's just like you,
except younger and feistier.

01:19.765 --> 01:24.045
And just full of beans, you know?
Sexy beans.

01:24.765 --> 01:26.925
Honestly, I thought I'd be the one
who ended up alone.

01:29.165 --> 01:32.085
<i>♪ Do-do-do-do ♪</i>

01:32.165 --> 01:34.525
<i>♪ Oh, my, I'm fallin' for another one ♪</i>

01:35.565 --> 01:37.245
You're our attorney, you tell me!

01:37.325 --> 01:39.805
<i>Listen, I'm afraid your accounts</i>
<i>are frozen.</i>

01:39.885 --> 01:42.405
What do you mean
my accounts are frozen?

01:42.485 --> 01:45.725
How unfair!
I knew nothing about the fraud!

01:45.805 --> 01:48.805
- <i>Yeah!</i>
-Stop laughing, I am bereft here!

01:48.885 --> 01:52.925
My darling husband, my Ron,
is on the run from the FBI!

01:53.005 --> 01:56.085
- <i>This is our last call.</i>
-What do you mean this is the last call?

01:56.165 --> 01:58.125
-I'm good for the money!

01:59.725 --> 02:02.805
-Oh, God! This can't be happening!

02:05.125 --> 02:07.685
-Breakfast in bed, m'lady?
-Oh, how sweet.

02:08.765 --> 02:11.205
Eggs à la Steve Chance.

02:11.285 --> 02:14.445
It's, er, scrambled eggs, avocado,

02:14.525 --> 02:16.485
chicken jalfrezi.

02:16.565 --> 02:19.565
-Enjoy.
-Such English gallantry!

02:19.645 --> 02:22.325
-I could just eat you up!
- Please eat me up.

02:22.405 --> 02:24.245
Goodbye, my hairy little knight.

02:26.725 --> 02:28.725
I'm going to marry that woman.

02:35.485 --> 02:39.245
Grantley Academy? Dad, I can't believe
you'd even consider it!

02:39.325 --> 02:40.965
Don't worry, Rach, I've told him.

02:41.045 --> 02:43.245
My old dad would kill me
if we sent Sid to private school.

02:43.325 --> 02:45.885
-Look at us, we've even got a nanny!
-Yeah!

02:45.965 --> 02:48.325
I'm still a progressive.
I listen to The Smiths!

02:48.405 --> 02:52.045
I retweet JK Rowling. It's...
It's just about looking after your own.

02:52.125 --> 02:53.565
Yeah, that's what they all say.

02:53.645 --> 02:56.365
Next thing you know, you've got
four million Palestinians under curfew.

02:56.445 --> 03:00.565
Oh, come on! Sid's got brains,
real brains! Here, watch this.

03:02.805 --> 03:03.685
Sid?

03:04.725 --> 03:06.245
When was the Battle of Hastings?

03:06.325 --> 03:08.925
-Richard III!
- No, no, the other one.

03:09.005 --> 03:12.405
-1066!
-Thank you! Genius in the making.

03:14.965 --> 03:16.285
What is that you're feeding him, Angela?

03:16.365 --> 03:19.605
-Heart of chicken.
-Yummy, yummy, chicken heart.

03:20.205 --> 03:22.725
Should we be feeding offal
to a four-year-old?

03:23.685 --> 03:26.685
My husband eats chicken heart
every morning.

03:26.765 --> 03:30.925
He huge killing machine.
He kill nine Croats during the war.

03:31.285 --> 03:33.565
Not like you, jelly belly.

03:35.605 --> 03:38.125
I do not like that nanny.

03:40.085 --> 03:41.605
-Hello, brother.

03:41.685 --> 03:44.245
-Brother of mine!
-Ivy, what are you doing here?

03:44.325 --> 03:46.485
Well, I just thought I'd drop by
and say hello!

03:46.565 --> 03:49.245
I mean, when was the last time
we saw each other?

03:49.325 --> 03:51.205
I believe that the last time
we saw each other

03:51.285 --> 03:53.565
was when you came to my home
acting all high and mighty

03:53.645 --> 03:55.445
and you tried to buy my dead body!

03:55.525 --> 03:58.445
Oh, Kenny, now, I know we got off
on the wrong foot,

03:58.525 --> 04:00.285
but we are family!

04:00.365 --> 04:03.965
And somehow we have both found
ourselves in this appalling place!

04:04.045 --> 04:08.125
And if we are going to get out of here,
we need to help each other!

04:08.725 --> 04:10.885
This has been my home for 30 years!

04:10.965 --> 04:13.485
And maybe together we can change that!

04:13.565 --> 04:15.565
Right, get out of it.

04:15.645 --> 04:16.885
Out, out!

04:16.965 --> 04:19.925
I've got a four-year-old son
and we try and keep him away from evil.

04:20.005 --> 04:22.645
You mean I am unwelcome
in my own brother's home?

04:22.725 --> 04:26.485
-You are most unwelcome, you fraud.
-Well, if that's the way it is,

04:26.565 --> 04:29.445
I am perfectly fine across the road
at your gallant friend Stuart's.

04:29.525 --> 04:32.445
-Steve's!
-No difference. Goodbye, dear brother!

04:33.565 --> 04:35.005
See you never!

04:51.245 --> 04:53.165
Sorry, are you busy?

04:53.765 --> 04:55.325
No, no, not really.

04:55.405 --> 05:00.685
Cos I just felt compelled to say this.
You are absolutely fucking gorgeous.

05:02.405 --> 05:05.445
Oh! Wow, right, thank you.

05:05.525 --> 05:07.205
Your looks, yes, but...

05:08.245 --> 05:11.405
just, like, your style
and just, something about you.
I've been sitting there kind of... in awe!

05:16.165 --> 05:18.165
Oh, well, good opinion!

05:19.365 --> 05:23.125
I just thought I'd say it because,
I think, so often people can be scared

05:23.205 --> 05:26.685
of making each other feel awkward
and just... chances go by.

05:26.765 --> 05:28.685
Well, I'm flattered, honestly.

05:28.765 --> 05:30.525
And it's not awkward, I promise.

05:34.805 --> 05:37.205
-Ooh, well, it's a bit awkward now!
- Of course!

05:38.005 --> 05:39.085
I'll go.

-Why is Angela leaving?

06:35.645 --> 06:37.605
No reason. Not Daddy's fault.

06:39.645 --> 06:43.365
-You might have to come to my meeting.
-No, meetings are boring!

06:44.605 --> 06:45.645
Shit!

06:48.125 --> 06:51.445
We don't need any stupid brother,
do we, Miss Tigglytopps?

06:51.525 --> 06:54.725
People think because I'm privileged
that I can't take care of myself.

06:54.805 --> 06:56.645
-Gah...

06:57.605 --> 06:59.885
What is the liquid stuff
that goes in coffee?

07:01.765 --> 07:03.485
Sid, don't touch anything!

07:10.285 --> 07:12.325
Well, I never!

07:12.405 --> 07:14.125
You are not welcome in my house, either.

07:14.205 --> 07:16.365
-Hear me out.
-OK.

07:17.165 --> 07:19.525
-OK.
-What?

07:19.605 --> 07:23.765
Ivy, sister, remember what I was saying
about us not being able to hang out?

07:23.845 --> 07:27.205
-You were inhumanly cruel.
-I was. I was cruel.

07:28.285 --> 07:29.445
But I've been thinking,

07:29.525 --> 07:32.965
what would be the next best thing
to hanging out with me?

07:33.045 --> 07:36.285
Why, hanging out with my adorable son!

07:37.765 --> 07:39.605
His nanny's had to go,
personal emergency.

07:39.685 --> 07:42.725
Really? Wouldn't have anything to do
with you rushing out in the drive

07:42.805 --> 07:44.845
in your bathrobe just now, would it?

07:44.925 --> 07:45.925
No.

07:47.245 --> 07:49.885
I mistook her for my wife.
They've got very similar hair!

07:50.445 --> 07:51.525
Of course they do.

07:52.085 --> 07:55.605
Brother, I shall look after your child,
but in return...

07:55.685 --> 07:58.245
-Here we go.
-...you have to be nice to me.

07:58.325 --> 08:02.165
These are trying times
and I need my family!

08:02.245 --> 08:05.285
You and Lorn and Daniel
and I want to say...

08:07.165 --> 08:09.525
-...Abigail.
-Incredibly wrong.
But fine,
you look after the kid for the day

08:12.045 --> 08:14.805
and I promise
we will all begin to like you.

08:14.885 --> 08:16.605
Despite your appalling personality.

08:16.685 --> 08:18.485
That is all I ask.

08:19.565 --> 08:21.085
-Hugs?
-Not yet.

08:21.645 --> 08:22.925
Hugs can wait.

08:24.205 --> 08:28.405
Sidney, where are you?
It's your aunt Ivy to the rescue!

08:29.045 --> 08:31.085
Oh! Ohh!

08:31.165 --> 08:32.365
So...

08:32.445 --> 08:33.845
when do I milk it?

08:34.485 --> 08:37.085
Him?
You don't milk him, he's a human child!

08:37.165 --> 08:39.725
Obviously,
I mean when do I give it its milk?

08:39.805 --> 08:42.165
-He's four!
-Four?

08:43.045 --> 08:45.605
Shouldn't he be taller?
Rich kids are taller.

08:45.685 --> 08:47.005
What's this?

08:49.085 --> 08:52.045
Oh, it's a brochure for
a private school, it's for Sid.

08:52.125 --> 08:53.645
Private school?

08:53.725 --> 08:57.245
Oh, that's wonderful!
British private schools are the best!

08:57.325 --> 09:02.725
-All those owls and gowns, so cute!
-Right, well, it's not happening.

09:02.805 --> 09:04.565
Lorna doesn't approve,
so you may as well chuck it.

09:04.645 --> 09:05.925
I see.

09:06.005 --> 09:11.485
Well, before I chuck it,
how about I just roll it up real tight.

09:11.565 --> 09:13.525
That way, it's nice and compact

09:13.605 --> 09:16.805
and you can fit it neatly
up your pretty little vagina!

09:16.885 --> 09:18.085
Excuse me?

09:18.165 --> 09:21.965
Ken, you're going to let your wife
stop you from educating your son?

09:22.045 --> 09:24.685
Well, sort of <i>our </i>son.

09:24.765 --> 09:27.885
I see now.
No wonder all your children are failures.

09:27.965 --> 09:29.845
No wonder you're making passes
at the nanny.

09:29.925 --> 09:32.485
There is no male leadership
in this house.

09:33.365 --> 09:35.765
Oh, still here?
I left some paperwork.

09:35.845 --> 09:38.965
-What's she doing here?
-Who? Oh, Ivy!

09:40.165 --> 09:42.125
Ivy's here because Angela left.

09:42.205 --> 09:46.525
-What? Why did Angela leave?
-She left because, um...

09:46.605 --> 09:48.765
-Sid kicked her in the face.
-What?

09:48.845 --> 09:49.965
-What?
-Mm.

09:50.045 --> 09:53.165
That is true, actually.
It was one of Dale's karate kicks.

09:53.245 --> 09:56.845
Oh, her nose was bleeding
and her eye was just...

09:56.925 --> 10:00.365
Eye was all swollen,
and she came to me and she was, like,

10:00.445 --> 10:03.285
- "I'm leaving!"
- "My nose, it broken!"

10:03.365 --> 10:05.885
-"Yeah. Mm! I'm going!"
-"It broken! He is psychopath!"

10:05.965 --> 10:07.965
Yep, and Ken called me.

10:08.045 --> 10:10.685
Yeah, and Ivy stepped up
and here we are.

10:10.765 --> 10:12.205
-Here we are!
-Here we are.

10:13.165 --> 10:16.085
Sid kicked the nanny in the face?

10:16.165 --> 10:17.445
He did.

10:18.445 --> 10:21.245
Lorna, I'm beginning to think
there's something wrong with him.

10:22.565 --> 10:24.445
Oh, dear God.

10:24.525 --> 10:26.885
-I'm going to call Angela.
-No! No, no.

10:26.965 --> 10:29.645
You go back to work. Let me deal with it.
I'm on top of the details.

10:29.725 --> 10:30.685
OK, fine.

10:30.765 --> 10:32.245
-Right.
-Yeah.

10:32.325 --> 10:34.205
Sidney Thompson, you come here.

10:34.285 --> 10:37.525
We are going to have very strict words
tonight, young man. Come with me.

10:37.605 --> 10:39.245
Yeah. Y-you're damn right!

10:39.685 --> 10:41.925
You need to pull your act together,
sunshine!

10:42.645 --> 10:45.245
Did you feel that lie?

10:45.325 --> 10:47.565
That was some real
brother-sister synergy there!

10:47.645 --> 10:49.285
Ah! You're welcome.

10:49.965 --> 10:51.405
I just framed my son!

10:51.485 --> 10:54.245
He's four and hadn't been framed yet,
it needed to happen.

10:57.885 --> 11:00.365
Dig it!

11:03.165 --> 11:05.965
Rach, you're my best friend
and Tash is my girlfriend.

11:06.045 --> 11:07.245
You <i>have </i>to meet!

11:07.325 --> 11:11.605
-No, Ben, I've just got a lot on at work.
<i>-Well, I've booked a booth for seven.</i>

11:11.685 --> 11:14.085
<i>O'clock, not people! Ha.</i>

11:14.165 --> 11:15.845
Rach, you are going to love her.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.045
<i>She's just like you!</i>

11:17.125 --> 11:18.885
Well, no, that's not quite right.

11:18.965 --> 11:22.805
Imagine what you wished you were like
at 24. That's what she's like!

11:32.085 --> 11:33.445
How did you get in the house?

11:33.525 --> 11:36.965
Hey, there! I'm looking after
your brother for the day,

11:37.045 --> 11:38.845
because that's what families do.

11:38.925 --> 11:40.805
OK. Should Sid be riding your dog?

11:41.365 --> 11:43.325
Huh? Who's on the phone?

11:43.925 --> 11:47.245
-It's my friend, Ben.
-Your ex. Tell Aunt Ivy.

11:47.325 --> 11:49.525
Oh, no, there's nothing to tell.

11:49.605 --> 11:53.885
It's just he's desperate for me
to meet his girlfriend. God knows why.

11:53.965 --> 11:57.765
And you're madly jealous
and you want him back bad!

11:57.845 --> 11:59.405
No, that's not what's happening.

11:59.485 --> 12:02.885
No, it is.
You may not think it is, but it is.

12:02.965 --> 12:05.645
That's why Aunt Ivy is going to give you
a complete makeover,

12:05.725 --> 12:07.605
and boy, you need it.

12:08.525 --> 12:11.725
I think I'm going to go to my room.
I did not enjoy this conversation.

12:12.285 --> 12:13.685
Whoop-de-doo, Honey Tits!

12:13.765 --> 12:14.965
Not my name.

12:23.285 --> 12:24.845
Angela, hi, how are you?

12:24.925 --> 12:27.205
-Ken.
-Listen...

12:28.165 --> 12:31.085
I bought you some flowers
to say sorry. Peonies.

12:32.405 --> 12:34.405
Now, look, I know you must think
I'm some sort of lunatic.

12:34.485 --> 12:36.525
-I not think you lunatic.
-Good.

12:36.605 --> 12:39.285
Good, cos what happened back there
is entirely explainable.

12:39.365 --> 12:44.045
-I know. It's passion and sexy longings.
-Oh, no, no, no, no.

12:44.645 --> 12:49.125
-No, you see, I thought you were Lorna.
-Stop it, stop it, stop it, Ken!

12:49.205 --> 12:51.805
-I cannot bear another minute!
-Angela!

12:52.365 --> 12:55.485
I ran this morning
because I scared of what we do.

12:56.165 --> 12:59.205
The chemistry between us
has been unbearable since first day!

12:59.285 --> 13:01.605
What? You're always horrible to me!
As defence, and now you're coming here

13:04.085 --> 13:07.485
with ridiculous story
about how you mistake me for your wife.

13:08.365 --> 13:09.885
You feel it, too.

13:09.965 --> 13:11.085
Of course.

13:11.165 --> 13:16.765
I am beautiful woman and you,
gorilla with irresistible stomach,

13:16.845 --> 13:19.685
-like lovely mountain.
-What are you doing?

13:20.445 --> 13:22.525
You're right, we are both married.

13:22.605 --> 13:27.525
I need to stop working for you, and we
must keep this a secret from our spouses.

13:27.605 --> 13:31.165
What? Angela, there's nothing
to keep secret!

13:31.725 --> 13:33.325
You don't want me to keep secret

13:33.405 --> 13:37.165
you come at me in nudie from behind
and grabbed on my tush?

13:37.245 --> 13:39.525
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Keep that secret, obviously.

13:39.605 --> 13:41.645
I am so confusing!

13:43.285 --> 13:45.245
Big, sexy asshole!

13:51.525 --> 13:53.365
I didn't do it, I didn't!
Do not give me that, Sidney Thompson,
now sit!

13:55.365 --> 13:56.725
-No!
-Yes!

13:56.805 --> 13:59.685
Until you admit what you did,
you sit on the naughty... floor.

14:00.285 --> 14:02.725
Sit on the naughty floor!

14:04.485 --> 14:05.965
Bloody bungalow!

14:06.885 --> 14:09.245
Little brat,
he's still claiming he didn't do it.

14:10.085 --> 14:12.565
-Do you think maybe he's suffered enough?
-Oh, no, no.

14:12.645 --> 14:14.485
We're not going soft on him.

14:14.565 --> 14:18.325
I texted Angela, no reply.
We need to vet his toys.

14:18.405 --> 14:20.245
No more guns, Sid.

14:20.325 --> 14:21.485
No more lightsabre.

14:21.565 --> 14:24.685
The lightsabre is a tool of peace!
I didn't do it!

14:27.285 --> 14:29.725
They've got them
on the dark side, too, Sid.

14:31.045 --> 14:31.965
Ah, you're still here.

14:32.045 --> 14:35.525
Well, when Lorna came home she was
so busy busting your son's ass,

14:35.605 --> 14:37.205
I just thought I'd hang out and drink!

14:37.285 --> 14:39.605
God, what sort of father am I,

14:39.685 --> 14:41.925
letting my son take the blame
for my mistakes?

14:42.005 --> 14:44.365
Oh, come on,
Sid'll forget it like that.

14:44.445 --> 14:47.245
I mean, sure, it'll probably emerge
as late-life neurosis,
but that ain't your problem, am I right?

14:51.405 --> 14:53.005
Anyways...

14:53.085 --> 14:54.645
see you tomorrow, I guess!

14:54.725 --> 15:00.045
I'm really liking being a nanny,
finally getting to know my new fam!

15:01.765 --> 15:03.685
Why is Simon sitting on the floor?

15:04.725 --> 15:09.325
-Eugh!
-Look at you, drunk, demonic Mary Poppins.

15:09.405 --> 15:12.405
- Sorry, Sid.

15:14.165 --> 15:17.565
Sid went to bed crying he didn't do it.
It breaks my heart.

15:17.645 --> 15:20.645
Poor Sid, but we can't let that go.

15:21.765 --> 15:23.965
Look, Lorn,
there's something I need to say.

15:24.045 --> 15:29.045
You were right, something more disciplined
would suit him, if he has got a problem.

15:29.125 --> 15:31.045
Let's give Grantley Academy a call.

15:32.165 --> 15:33.165
What, really?

15:34.725 --> 15:38.325
-Because he took out the nanny.
-We're still progressives, though.

15:39.685 --> 15:41.325
Sorry, what was it
you wanted to say, love?

15:41.405 --> 15:43.805
Oh, nothing, no.
We're still progressives.

15:43.885 --> 15:46.485
That's the important
take-home message here.

15:46.565 --> 15:48.205
-Good night.
-Night, love.

16:02.245 --> 16:04.205
You know Angela's husband,
what's his name?

16:04.285 --> 16:06.485
Um, something Eastern European?

16:06.565 --> 16:07.845
Goran?

16:07.925 --> 16:10.685
He, um...
fought in the Balkans, didn't he?

16:10.765 --> 16:13.365
Yeah. Yeah, for years, apparently.

16:23.005 --> 16:25.325
-You not going to answer that?
-Nah.

16:28.285 --> 16:29.405
Oh, shit!

16:37.085 --> 16:38.285
-Ben...
-Agh! Don't!

16:40.245 --> 16:42.045
Huh. Rachel. Great to see you!

16:42.125 --> 16:43.525
-Hi!
-Hi!

16:43.605 --> 16:46.565
-Er, sorry about that, it's a--
-China thing.

16:46.645 --> 16:47.885
Yeah. Yeah.

16:47.965 --> 16:50.285
Tash was just having a ciggie
outside, so...

16:50.365 --> 16:51.685
-OK.
-Er...

16:51.765 --> 16:53.565
Oh, my God, it's you!

16:54.885 --> 16:57.045
Oh, hey! Um...

16:57.125 --> 17:00.405
Look, I'm just having a drink
with a mate, so I can't really talk.

17:00.485 --> 17:01.685
Sorry!

17:02.765 --> 17:04.965
Rach, this is Tash!

17:05.045 --> 17:08.845
Oh! Sorry, it's just, um,
we met earlier!

17:09.485 --> 17:13.325
Oh! Ben has been going on and on
about you ever since we met!

17:13.405 --> 17:15.525
-Oh!
-You're the one that got away!

17:15.605 --> 17:17.125
No!

17:18.125 --> 17:20.525
-Ben, would you grab us a drink?
-Sure, sure.

17:21.965 --> 17:25.605
-You two are going to get on so well!

17:26.645 --> 17:28.325
- Wow!
-OK!

17:33.325 --> 17:35.805
-Your margarita, Auntie.
-Oh!

17:36.485 --> 17:38.885
Ken, I am madly in love with him!

17:40.565 --> 17:44.685
In the business world, you're going to be
a ruthless predator, aren't you, Sid?

17:44.765 --> 17:48.205
-Hello, Ken. Don't mind me, just relaxing.

17:48.285 --> 17:50.485
Miss Tigglytopps has taken
a bit of a dislike to Steve.

17:50.565 --> 17:52.325
-It's best he just submits.
-Oh, God!
-What's that?

17:56.325 --> 17:59.405
Oh, Goran's coming over! Fun!

17:59.485 --> 18:03.245
Oh, shit! I think this Goran
may have killed people in the army.

18:03.325 --> 18:06.165
Relax, Ken. He's Latin,
they get fired up over nothing!

18:06.245 --> 18:08.405
-He's Balkan.
-They kill people.

18:08.485 --> 18:10.485
- There's a car in the drive.

18:10.565 --> 18:11.925
- Oh!

18:16.525 --> 18:19.085
-Well, what's he like?
-One big ball of muscle.

18:19.165 --> 18:21.565
-Huge! Killing machine!
-He's huge.

18:21.645 --> 18:25.125
Shame guns are illegal in this country.
This guy's gonna take some taking down.

18:25.205 --> 18:26.565
Oh, God! Oh, God!

18:26.645 --> 18:28.885
-Shit, shit, shit. Right, everybody hide!

18:28.965 --> 18:29.925
Shit!

18:30.005 --> 18:32.365
Well, <i>that </i>is unmanly.

18:32.445 --> 18:36.925
Come on, Sid, honey, we're gonna take you
back here so we don't see any blood!

18:38.445 --> 18:39.845
Get out there!

18:39.925 --> 18:42.405
-No! We can just lie low until he's gone!

18:42.485 --> 18:45.565
Then Lorna comes home and hears
Goran's side of the story, and...

18:45.645 --> 18:47.645
-Bollocks! Right, OK, all right.

18:47.725 --> 18:51.125
I'm going to have to get out of this
using the old Thompson silver tongue.

18:51.205 --> 18:52.285
That's it!

18:57.725 --> 19:00.045
-OK, mate, look--
-Mr Thompson!

19:00.125 --> 19:01.965
I need speak with you!

19:02.045 --> 19:05.125
- Oh, my God!

19:05.205 --> 19:07.285
-Why are they laughing?
-It's all right.

19:07.365 --> 19:09.725
They just were winding me up
saying I was going to have to fight you.

19:09.805 --> 19:13.845
You should be worried!
I deck your big ass right in!

19:13.925 --> 19:18.685
-He's tiny! What is it about short men?
-Short? I am of average height!

19:18.765 --> 19:20.605
I know that you're angry, OK,

19:20.685 --> 19:23.085
but I think there's been
a little misunderstanding, eh?

19:23.805 --> 19:25.245
No misunderstanding.

19:25.325 --> 19:30.365
You come on to my wife
and then you gave her penis!

19:30.445 --> 19:32.805
-God!
-Peonies, the flower!

19:32.885 --> 19:35.125
You gave my wife penis!

19:35.205 --> 19:37.765
I think you need to calm down.

19:37.845 --> 19:39.725
Ow! Agh!

19:39.805 --> 19:40.845
Oh, my God!

19:40.925 --> 19:42.365
Oh, God!

19:42.445 --> 19:44.725
What the... What the fuck?

19:44.805 --> 19:47.845
-Get off!

19:47.925 --> 19:49.765
-<i>Soto makikomi</i>, Ken.
-What?
Use the <i>soto makikomi</i>!

19:51.765 --> 19:54.765
I don't know what that is!
I don't know what that is!

19:56.285 --> 19:59.525
-Leave me alone! Now--

19:59.605 --> 20:01.565
What the f...? Agh!

20:01.645 --> 20:02.445
Oh!

20:04.285 --> 20:05.245
Fucking hell!

20:06.565 --> 20:08.005
-Fuck!

20:12.685 --> 20:15.485
-What's wrong with him?
-You fell on him, Ken!

20:16.125 --> 20:17.765
-Oh!
-He's dead.

20:17.845 --> 20:20.725
What? Oh, my God!

20:21.405 --> 20:23.325
Hang on, have you taken his pulse?

20:23.405 --> 20:26.485
No, I work off gut instinct.
I could check his pulse, if you like.

20:26.565 --> 20:28.085
-Would you?
-Yeah, sure.

20:29.685 --> 20:33.525
Yeah, strong pulse.
This human is alive, but he's unconscious.

20:33.605 --> 20:34.925
-Let's get him to the hospital.
-Yes.

20:35.845 --> 20:38.125
-There's Lorna.

20:38.205 --> 20:39.405
Shit!

20:42.445 --> 20:45.165
Welcome home, my love!

20:45.245 --> 20:48.005
-Ken, this is a very eager greeting!
-Well, I don't want to waste a second.

20:48.085 --> 20:52.525
Because I have booked a table for us at...
<i>Ba-ba-ba! </i>Carluccio's!

20:53.765 --> 20:57.485
Date night! Ivy and Steve are going
to look after Sid, isn't it wonderful?

20:57.565 --> 20:58.605
Let's get going.

20:58.685 --> 21:00.845
Ken, just let me take the weight
off my feet a minute.

21:00.925 --> 21:03.125
You can take the weight off
your feet at the restaurant!

21:03.205 --> 21:04.845
-All right, you two!
-Hi, Lorna.

21:04.925 --> 21:07.525
-Hi, Lorna.
-How's... how was the thing?

21:07.605 --> 21:08.925
Why aren't you sitting down?

21:09.005 --> 21:11.445
Oh, sitting's... Pssh.

21:11.525 --> 21:14.285
-Lorna, come on, the restaurant!
-Oh, Ken, what are you like?

21:14.365 --> 21:16.805
If you love the restaurant so much,
why don't you marry it?

21:19.205 --> 21:21.765
-Marry the restaurant, Ken!
-Fuck off, Steve.

21:27.525 --> 21:30.205
-What's going on?

21:30.285 --> 21:32.925
-What?

21:33.005 --> 21:34.765
Hungry!

21:35.965 --> 21:39.245
Oh, my...
A random man from the street!

21:39.325 --> 21:42.725
No, that's Goran, Angela's husband!

21:42.805 --> 21:45.325
Goran, why are you here?

21:45.405 --> 21:47.245
What? What happen?

21:47.805 --> 21:49.765
-What's he doing here?
-I don't know, come on!

21:50.765 --> 21:52.405
Did you see him come in?

21:54.605 --> 21:55.645
Goran!

21:55.725 --> 21:58.485
-Oh, Goran. Yes, now...
-Ah, ah, hmm.

21:58.565 --> 22:02.165
-He came round...
-Yeah, to pick up something for Angela.

22:02.245 --> 22:04.085
It was, um, a cashmere...

22:04.765 --> 22:06.925
Cardigan, she left on...

22:07.005 --> 22:08.965
...the radiator in the kitchen.

22:10.725 --> 22:13.925
He looks dazed.
Ken, make him a cup of tea!

22:14.005 --> 22:16.565
-No, but Carluccio's!
-No, tea.

22:16.645 --> 22:20.045
Maybe he can persuade Angela
to come back. Problem solved!

22:20.125 --> 22:22.845
That's a good... That's a good idea, tea.

22:23.565 --> 22:27.445
How's... How's Angela, Goran?
How's the head?

22:27.525 --> 22:30.725
It hurts so much. He's so heavy!

22:30.805 --> 22:32.605
Yes, he is a big lad.

22:32.685 --> 22:35.085
-He's the tallest in the nursery.
-What?

22:35.165 --> 22:37.925
Maybe you could have a word
with Angela for us?

22:38.005 --> 22:40.685
Angela? Angela?

22:40.765 --> 22:43.245
-Angela, he--
-I think Goran is very sick.
-Feel his forehead!
-Oh, burning.

22:45.885 --> 22:48.565
-You are going to hospital, young man.
- Let's go to hospital.

22:48.645 --> 22:50.485
-Come on.
-Here we go.

22:51.965 --> 22:53.885
Angela, he...

22:53.965 --> 22:55.365
He... he...

22:55.445 --> 22:58.965
-Goran, before you go, I just--
-Lorna, let the man get to hospital.

22:59.045 --> 23:02.885
All right. Before you go, I do want
to apologise, about Angela.

23:02.965 --> 23:06.445
-Huh?
-Why you impologise, it was him!

23:09.845 --> 23:13.685
I know he feels bad about it,
but he's been having some problems lately.

23:13.765 --> 23:17.565
He's never hit anyone before.
Well, he's hit a few children, obviously.

23:17.645 --> 23:21.645
Seriously? He is the terrible human being!

23:21.725 --> 23:23.845
Goran, you've gone too far,
you're going to have to leave!

23:23.925 --> 23:27.085
He is bad. Very bad.
And annoy-ning!

23:27.645 --> 23:29.245
And he has bad clothes!

23:29.325 --> 23:30.565
And a...
silly face!

23:33.405 --> 23:35.045
Oh, how rude!

23:35.125 --> 23:37.205
-I know. Rude, rude man!
-Yes!

23:37.285 --> 23:38.565
The bloody fantasist!

23:38.645 --> 23:41.605
Sid, come here.
Don't you listen to a thing of that.

23:42.485 --> 23:45.245
-You're fine.
-Oh, I'm a bad person.

23:45.325 --> 23:48.205
Oh, there, there.
It's OK to be a little bad.

23:48.285 --> 23:50.165
-Oh!

23:56.765 --> 23:58.885
Look what we picked up after nursery!

23:58.965 --> 24:00.405
-Aw.
-Yep!

24:00.485 --> 24:03.965
Sold out all my principles,
but nice material.

24:04.565 --> 24:05.965
Come on, love.

24:06.765 --> 24:08.885
I feel so guilty.

24:08.965 --> 24:13.245
Oh, Kenny, you wanted something and
you got it. How often does that happen?

24:13.325 --> 24:15.085
Yeah. Not that often, actually.

24:15.165 --> 24:17.405
It's gonna happen a lot more
now that I'm here.

24:17.485 --> 24:18.925
Oh...

24:19.005 --> 24:20.565
Are you going to make me evil?

24:20.645 --> 24:22.325
Feels great, doesn't it?

24:22.405 --> 24:24.125
And the best part is,
no-one's ever going to know.

24:24.205 --> 24:27.165
Unless you're mean to me,
and then I'll tell immediately.

24:27.245 --> 24:29.645
I've got your balls in a vice.

24:29.725 --> 24:30.885
In a sisterly way.

24:32.125 --> 24:34.845
Daddy, Daddy, look what I drawed today!
Oh, wow! Well done!

24:39.325 --> 24:41.125
Would you look at that?

24:45.965 --> 24:47.805
-Burn it?
-Burn it.
