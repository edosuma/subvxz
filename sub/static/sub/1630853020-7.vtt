00:14.240 --> 00:18.880
<i>Aethelhelm has succeeded in starting</i>
<i>a war between Saxon and Dane.</i>

00:19.880 --> 00:21.720
<i>But his treachery was discovered.</i>

00:21.800 --> 00:23.320
Sigtryggr did not kill the queen.

00:23.400 --> 00:25.320
It was the work of Aethelhelm’s men.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.200
He must be apprehended.

00:27.280 --> 00:29.840
<i>Seeking to weaken</i>
<i>the Saxon forces,</i>

00:29.920 --> 00:35.480
<i>Sigtryggr marched boldly into battle</i>
<i>and took the fight Aethelhelm’s men.</i>

00:39.920 --> 00:42.360
<i>But Edward’s arrival turned the tide.</i>

00:43.160 --> 00:47.760
I rode for peace and Sigtryggr
has repaid us with more bloodshed.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.280
They must be saved!

00:52.720 --> 00:56.760
<i>While Aethelhelm escaped,</i>
<i>Sigtryggr was taken prisoner.</i>

00:56.840 --> 00:59.040
You must accept the gift of baptism.

00:59.120 --> 01:00.320
- I cannot.

01:00.400 --> 01:03.400
<i>And I was given the gravest duty.</i>

01:03.480 --> 01:05.640
You must be the one to do it.

01:05.720 --> 01:08.040
<i>That Sigtryggr</i>
<i>might reach Valhalla.</i>

01:10.680 --> 01:14.040
<i>Brida’s desire for vengeance</i>
<i>is as strong as ever.</i>

01:16.000 --> 01:18.200
- Tell him I’m coming for him.

01:18.280 --> 01:21.480
<i>And a new threat</i>
<i>has emerged in the north.</i>

01:21.560 --> 01:24.800
<i>King Constantin of Scotland</i>
<i>has formed an alliance</i>

01:24.880 --> 01:29.680
<i>with the lords of Northumbria,</i>
<i>disputed territory he claims as his own.</i>

01:29.760 --> 01:34.840
This is a moment to join as one.

01:34.920 --> 01:37.600
<i>Among them is my cousin Wihtgar,</i>

01:38.160 --> 01:41.520
<i>who murdered his father</i>
<i>to steal my birthright for himself.</i>

01:44.400 --> 01:45.840
<i>Destiny is all!</i>

02:29.280 --> 02:30.320
My queen.

02:42.960 --> 02:46.240
Do not forget me on this,
your final journey.

02:47.480 --> 02:51.040
Your blade and my heart…
will remain yours.

03:08.960 --> 03:11.440
Tonight all love is buried.

04:04.440 --> 04:09.040
Sigtryggr, you lived as a warrior!

04:09.120 --> 04:11.760
And you died… a king!

04:11.840 --> 04:14.120
- Sigtryggr!

04:19.360 --> 04:20.560
We should unite in grief.

04:20.640 --> 04:23.160
My grief is that you lived and he did not.

04:23.240 --> 04:24.200
Leave her be.

04:25.240 --> 04:27.240
May we die as you did!

04:28.080 --> 04:31.600
With honor in our hearts
and laughter in our throats!

04:32.160 --> 04:35.240
- May you sail safely to Valhalla…

04:35.320 --> 04:37.400
…where we will drink with you again!

04:38.160 --> 04:39.160
We will meet again!

04:39.240 --> 04:40.560
To Valhalla!

04:40.640 --> 04:42.120
To Sigtryggr!

04:42.200 --> 04:43.600
To Sigtryggr!

04:45.400 --> 04:46.360
To Sigtryggr!

05:33.320 --> 05:34.560
Have you seen Father?

05:37.520 --> 05:39.520
The Warrior Priest of Rumcofa.

05:39.600 --> 05:40.800
He showed great courage.

05:40.880 --> 05:42.360
And made Osferth proud.

05:42.440 --> 05:44.880
I have heard of your bravery.
Let us drink to it.

05:44.960 --> 05:46.760
I bring news I do not wish to break.

05:47.760 --> 05:49.320
Brida has struck again.

06:04.680 --> 06:08.160
If he survives the night,
he does so at God's mercy.

06:16.880 --> 06:20.640
We’re all here, Pyrlig.
You are with friends.

06:21.840 --> 06:26.320
Uhtred… she wants to punish you.

06:27.400 --> 06:29.200
She will not rest.

06:47.200 --> 06:49.920
Fetch Aethelstan. We will need his guard.

06:51.080 --> 06:53.840
We’ll hunt her down. We’ll kill her.

07:47.360 --> 07:50.120
- Have they found the witch?
- No, Lord King.

07:50.200 --> 07:52.560
And how does one woman hide
from the Mercian Guard?

07:52.640 --> 07:55.200
I do not know,
but Uhtred and his men will find her.

07:55.280 --> 07:57.080
And Aethelhelm,
does he still wander my lands?

07:57.480 --> 08:00.320
Also no news as yet.
Rumors he is heading south.

08:00.400 --> 08:02.920
Of course he is.
He will try to raise a rebellion.

08:06.560 --> 08:09.000
- Can Pyrlig travel?
- No.

08:10.400 --> 08:12.320
Then we shall have to leave him here.

08:12.800 --> 08:15.400
Is it wise to leave Eoferwic
while Brida roams?

08:15.480 --> 08:18.760
It depends on your feelings
towards Aethelhelm seizing Winchester.

08:20.360 --> 08:22.920
That will be his plan. We must get south.

08:23.440 --> 08:26.000
Was Aelfweard informed
of Aethelhelm's treachery?

08:26.080 --> 08:28.080
We felt that was news for you to break.

08:28.160 --> 08:30.720
Indeed, my son has been
through far too much of late

08:30.800 --> 08:33.360
and to hear of this
would only wound him further.

08:33.440 --> 08:36.520
Lord, I understand your reasons to leave,

08:37.440 --> 08:39.799
but I must stress
I am concerned for Eoferwic.

08:39.880 --> 08:41.679
You saw yourself
the atmosphere is febrile.

08:41.760 --> 08:44.600
Indeed.
How differently the Danes mark death.

08:44.679 --> 08:46.000
If we abandon Eoferwic,

08:46.080 --> 08:49.280
then our men who died defeating Sigtryggr
will have done so for nothing.

08:50.760 --> 08:52.320
Secure Eoferwic…

08:53.880 --> 08:57.480
and we have the opportunity to foray
further north, bring the entirety

08:57.560 --> 09:00.360
of Northumbria under your command,
fulfil the dream of every Saxon--

09:00.440 --> 09:03.320
It will mean nothing
if we lose Wessex to Aethelhelm.

09:04.720 --> 09:08.800
The people here are volatile,
the mood not favorable.

09:09.360 --> 09:11.280
Much pain is felt for the Lady Stiorra

09:11.360 --> 09:13.720
and I fear her grief
could ferment more trouble.

09:13.800 --> 09:16.960
- Add Brida to that and--
- The air is poisoned. I understand.

09:21.600 --> 09:25.240
If sympathy for the young widow
is the problem, that can be resolved.

09:27.560 --> 09:28.840
Summon Lord Uhtred.

09:38.080 --> 09:40.200
Do not ask. We did not find her.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.080
Perhaps she’s left these lands.

09:42.160 --> 09:45.640
Pyrlig could not have traveled far
with his injuries. She’s still near.

09:45.720 --> 09:48.520
She knows that to return
to Eoferwic means certain death.

09:48.600 --> 09:50.880
She’s ruthless, but she’s not foolish.

09:51.640 --> 09:53.800
Rest the horses. We will ride out again.

09:55.280 --> 09:58.000
Uhtred, you are summoned to the King.

09:58.480 --> 10:00.280
There is no news. That is the news.

10:00.360 --> 10:02.720
Nonetheless, his word stands. Come.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.080
Lord Uhtred.

10:15.040 --> 10:16.400
I bring you nothing.

10:16.480 --> 10:19.920
No Brida, no Aethelhelm,
no change in Pyrlig.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.600
How then are the Danes?

10:22.720 --> 10:24.760
Danes of Eoferwic.

10:24.840 --> 10:26.920
Since when have you cared for them?

10:27.000 --> 10:28.600
Since I became their king.

10:30.440 --> 10:34.240
I know it sounds a little strange.
To rule Danes was not my expectation.

10:34.320 --> 10:36.080
You’ve always coveted these lands.

10:36.160 --> 10:39.240
Indeed, but my hope was
that a conquest would be peaceful,

10:39.320 --> 10:41.480
that the people would live side by side.

10:41.560 --> 10:44.200
That became difficult
when you martyred their king.

10:45.000 --> 10:50.160
Yes. I see the King's widow has a grief
that would move the stoniest of hearts.

10:50.240 --> 10:52.880
She’s young. She loved him very much.

10:52.960 --> 10:58.000
She has lost a great deal,
her future, her status, her home.

10:58.080 --> 11:00.400
All of which she would forgo
to have the man.

11:00.480 --> 11:02.760
Still, her grief
could become a touchstone.

11:03.640 --> 11:06.320
Perhaps it is wise
she hide it a little better.

11:07.480 --> 11:08.800
That is impossible.

11:09.560 --> 11:13.200
Perhaps then I can offer her a salve.

11:14.040 --> 11:17.840
I need to take my household south,
to sit again on the throne in Wessex.

11:17.920 --> 11:20.000
- You fear Aethelhelm--
- I fear no one.

11:21.040 --> 11:23.400
But I suspect Aethelhelm
will fuel dissent,

11:23.480 --> 11:25.440
which is why I need Eoferwic at peace.

11:25.520 --> 11:29.280
Tell that to Brida.
I’m sure she will comply with your wishes.

11:29.360 --> 11:32.720
I do not expect Brida to comply,
but I would hope Stiorra might.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.000
What is it you want her to do?

11:36.080 --> 11:39.640
Tell her to swear to me, publicly,
to bring comfort to the Danes

11:39.720 --> 11:41.840
that all is resolved between us.

11:42.760 --> 11:45.120
The people here
have endured too much for that.

11:45.200 --> 11:47.200
We have all endured too much.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.760
She could lead the Danes
as your sister led in Mercia.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.640
It could give her some purpose.
It could restore something--

12:04.720 --> 12:07.640
As long as her purpose
is not to lead them against me.

12:07.720 --> 12:10.360
I do not think
she has an appetite for rebellion.

12:13.680 --> 12:15.640
But she will not take a baptism.

12:15.720 --> 12:18.760
My father ensured
she was baptized as a girl,

12:18.840 --> 12:20.320
so she is already saved.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.320
I see no need to do that again.

12:24.480 --> 12:27.400
I must be acknowledged
as the true overlord of Eoferwic.

12:28.800 --> 12:31.000
And in return, she has your protection?

12:31.960 --> 12:34.960
- Yes.
- Then I will tell her to comply.

12:36.040 --> 12:37.240
Thank you, Lord King.

12:39.240 --> 12:42.400
It is an honor
I know my daughter will not be expecting.

12:42.480 --> 12:47.280
If we cannot honor our greatest warriors,
we cannot be great kings.

13:05.360 --> 13:09.920
God is merciful. That is her horse.
She will be close by.

13:10.480 --> 13:14.520
Wait here in case she returns to it.
We will look for her.

13:42.240 --> 13:45.840
Lady Aelfwynn? It is you.
You are Aelfwynn of Mercia.

13:48.760 --> 13:51.160
You, you confuse me for another.

13:51.240 --> 13:56.000
Surely not. I am, I am Glaedwine.
I too am of Mercia.

13:56.520 --> 13:58.440
I was errand boy to your mother.

14:01.760 --> 14:03.320
My heart grieves for your loss.

14:04.960 --> 14:08.400
If you did once serve my mother,
then do as I ask and leave me alone.

14:08.480 --> 14:10.040
My lady, are you in trouble?

14:11.920 --> 14:16.200
My grandmother would imprison me
in a convent for my own safety.

14:16.920 --> 14:19.560
Then it is well that our paths
have crossed, my lady.

14:20.240 --> 14:23.400
I have been tasked to serve you
and to protect you.

14:23.480 --> 14:24.840
Tasked by whom?

14:25.440 --> 14:28.040
Someone who cares for you very much.

14:28.720 --> 14:30.680
Cynlaef? He lives?

14:32.120 --> 14:34.600
- He’s been searching for you.
- I thought he was…

14:35.040 --> 14:39.160
Well, let us make haste.
I fear Lady Aelswith's guard are near.

14:39.640 --> 14:41.840
Where is he? Where’s Cynlaef?

14:41.920 --> 14:43.200
This way, my lady.

14:58.400 --> 14:59.360
Go on.

15:13.840 --> 15:15.080
Lady Aelfwynn?

15:20.360 --> 15:22.920
I thought you said Cynlaef
was going to be here.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.360
Never trust a handsome man,
my lady Aelfwynn.

15:26.280 --> 15:29.240
They only want to hump you, or rob you.

15:36.400 --> 15:39.840
There. The elder is the man
who approached me in Aegelesburg,

15:39.920 --> 15:41.920
who offered me silver for Aelfwynn.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.720
We have met before, have we not?

15:46.800 --> 15:47.960
Lady Eadith.

15:48.040 --> 15:50.280
One alehouse whore is much like another.

15:50.360 --> 15:51.600
She is no whore.

15:51.680 --> 15:55.080
It is unwise to insult a lady
who travels defended by Mercian Guard.

15:59.680 --> 16:00.960
She's no friend of yours.

16:01.040 --> 16:04.800
She took silver from me
in exchange for news of your whereabouts.

16:05.920 --> 16:10.320
Then may your charity be returned
in exchange for Aelfwynn.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.160
This is no business of yours, witch.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.360
Perhaps not of hers,

16:17.440 --> 16:22.840
but as Aelfwynn is my granddaughter,
it is most definitely business of mine.

16:27.600 --> 16:29.800
Lady Aelswith, I did not recognize you.

16:30.360 --> 16:33.280
It is an honor to keep the company
of your granddaughter.

16:34.360 --> 16:39.360
You may keep the silver
as reward for finding her.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.880
He was too reasonable.

16:58.960 --> 17:03.520
You underestimate how men crumble
in the face of Alfred's widow.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.360
Anyway, fear not, our guards are close.

17:22.359 --> 17:25.680
It would be ill-advised
to cry out for help.

17:35.640 --> 17:39.680
I ask for just one moment!
I wish only to speak to her as a brother!

17:39.760 --> 17:42.400
And yet the word of her father
must come first.

17:45.280 --> 17:47.640
Please tell me Brida is your captive.

17:48.360 --> 17:49.200
I cannot.

17:49.280 --> 17:52.160
Then tell me she will be mine
so that I may punish her.

17:53.720 --> 17:56.000
She is the source of all our sorrows.

17:56.080 --> 17:57.400
Then do not think on her.

17:57.480 --> 18:01.080
Better to think on the one who started it
than on the one who dealt the final blow.

18:01.160 --> 18:04.320
I’m in grief for Sigtryggr, too,
and you know this.

18:06.000 --> 18:09.480
You have been wronged by many things,
but this anger will destroy you.

18:09.560 --> 18:15.360
Destroy what? I am nothing.
A wife to no one, a queen to nowhere.

18:15.440 --> 18:17.200
Yet you are still a daughter...

18:17.720 --> 18:20.880
with a father who would do anything
to make this right.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.200
I cannot raise the dead,
but I can raise you from your grief.

18:26.280 --> 18:28.560
I think you could find
some solace in comfort.

18:28.640 --> 18:31.960
- That is all I want, Father.
- And so there is an offer.

18:32.600 --> 18:36.720
Edward proposes that you be lady here
and rule for him in his stead.

18:37.240 --> 18:40.400
You would not be queen,
but Eoferwic would look to you.

18:40.480 --> 18:42.440
What does Edward want in return?

18:43.920 --> 18:48.360
- You must swear allegiance and forgive--
- I do not forgive. I cannot in my heart.

18:48.440 --> 18:51.840
Then forgive with your mouth
and let your heart keep silent.

18:51.920 --> 18:53.720
I am no more an oath-breaker than you are.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.000
Yes, but you are a woman alone
and I am not.

18:56.080 --> 18:57.920
As your father,
I can offer some protection.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.200
- But the day will come--
- When you'll be called elsewhere

19:00.280 --> 19:04.000
and I will be left as a target,
as was always true.

19:04.600 --> 19:06.800
Please, see that you need to do this.

19:07.400 --> 19:09.800
For you to thrive, I want you to accept.

19:17.600 --> 19:20.760
Who are they? Why have they taken us?

19:20.840 --> 19:24.560
Your uncle wants you concealed
so you do not threaten the Mercian throne.

19:25.160 --> 19:29.280
No, my son is shrewd

19:29.360 --> 19:32.320
and if he felt she was a threat,
he would keep her close.

19:32.400 --> 19:35.240
Not use hired men on the road.

19:35.800 --> 19:38.880
Only a wealthy coward would pay men to…

19:41.200 --> 19:45.000
Oh, you foolish woman.

19:46.800 --> 19:48.000
Aethelhelm.

19:49.120 --> 19:51.720
He is as rich as he is cunning.

19:51.800 --> 19:55.800
Only he would be so bold
to arrange the seizing of a lady,

19:55.880 --> 19:58.560
a former queen and a…

20:00.640 --> 20:03.200
Well, he did not know
you were going to be here.

20:03.280 --> 20:06.880
- That is a great comfort.
- What would Aethelhelm want with me?

20:06.960 --> 20:12.040
I do not know, but I am certain
I have no wish to find out.

20:12.960 --> 20:14.360
How do we resist?

20:14.840 --> 20:17.160
We have no weapons, no plan.

20:17.240 --> 20:20.200
That is not completely true.

20:26.040 --> 20:30.000
People have come for my life
on other occasions.

20:31.880 --> 20:36.200
Of course I am schooled
in how to protect myself.

20:52.840 --> 20:55.640
Aelfwynn, do not fear.

20:56.360 --> 21:00.840
They look at us and they see
weak and feeble women,

21:00.920 --> 21:03.720
but therein lies our strength.

21:04.240 --> 21:09.240
Aethelhelm and his men
are fools to underestimate us.

21:26.920 --> 21:31.400
We have pledged our allegiance.
Why does the king not let us leave?

21:32.560 --> 21:34.920
He is swinging his cock around.

21:35.600 --> 21:37.720
I’m not even certain he has a plan.

21:38.160 --> 21:40.480
You think there will be war with Wessex?

21:41.000 --> 21:41.920
No.

21:43.680 --> 21:46.040
Peace serves both kings better.

21:46.720 --> 21:50.600
We stay here, kiss arses, go home.

21:56.160 --> 21:58.720
That old goat's not of Northumbria.

21:58.800 --> 22:02.400
Just another lord whose balls
hang lower than his coin purse.

22:04.680 --> 22:05.840
Lord King.

22:15.120 --> 22:19.600
They call me the Dane-humper,
but I’m fairly sure they’re assassins.

22:19.680 --> 22:22.920
You Edward's ambassador?

22:23.000 --> 22:26.320
I am from Wessex, yes. Lord Aethelhelm.

22:28.440 --> 22:29.880
Well, show me the gift.

22:32.080 --> 22:35.520
My humble apologies, Lord King,
there is no gift.

22:37.040 --> 22:42.040
No toe of St. Cuthbert
or bread from the Last Supper?

22:43.600 --> 22:48.800
The king is not sure you appreciate
holy relics in Scotland.

22:49.520 --> 22:50.360
Hm.

22:51.680 --> 22:53.440
Did he tell you to say that?

22:54.800 --> 22:56.280
To insult me?

22:57.160 --> 22:59.360
Forgive me. I’m just the messenger.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.360
I’ve heard of his conquest of Mercia.

23:09.600 --> 23:12.760
Does the treaty I made
with Aethelflaed still stand?

23:14.360 --> 23:17.720
The king has not spoken to me of a treaty.

23:17.800 --> 23:19.560
Then he intends to come north?

23:20.160 --> 23:23.080
Again, not something he has spoken of.

23:25.480 --> 23:29.080
Why send an ambassador
who claims to know nothing?

23:30.400 --> 23:32.760
What game is this?

23:34.680 --> 23:38.120
Does he want me to cut your head off
and send it back?

23:40.760 --> 23:46.560
Lord King, you seem to be a man
who knows the quality of mercy.

23:47.680 --> 23:51.280
I therefore throw myself
upon your compassion.

23:51.760 --> 23:54.920
I come to give you fair warning.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.000
Of?

23:57.160 --> 24:00.600
I fear King Edward's eye
wanders northwards...

24:01.720 --> 24:04.360
to Northumbria and to Scotland.

24:06.480 --> 24:09.480
And these ambitions are not shared by me.

24:14.840 --> 24:17.480
So you’re telling me this
out of the goodness of your heart.

24:17.560 --> 24:18.840
No.

24:18.920 --> 24:20.880
I do not need warning.

24:21.880 --> 24:24.080
We are already prepared.

24:25.040 --> 24:28.480
Half the lords of Northumbria
are sworn to me.

24:28.560 --> 24:31.480
So if it is war you wish to avert,

24:31.960 --> 24:34.160
you have picked
the wrong king to dissuade.

24:34.240 --> 24:37.680
You misunderstand me.
I do not come for peace.

24:38.480 --> 24:42.280
Well, what, then? What is this trickery?

24:43.600 --> 24:45.160
It’s a bluff.

24:46.360 --> 24:51.360
I know Edward is your family,
husband to your daughter!

24:51.440 --> 24:52.640
And that…

24:54.880 --> 24:56.360
that is the thing.

24:58.200 --> 25:01.000
Forgive me, Lord King,
for she was murdered!

25:03.960 --> 25:06.600
News of the queen's death
had yet to reach my ears.

25:06.680 --> 25:11.760
Edward would have Wessex believe
it was Danes.

25:27.720 --> 25:28.880
So…

25:31.600 --> 25:34.240
it is vengeance you seek?

25:34.320 --> 25:36.080
Lord King, if I…

25:38.960 --> 25:42.960
The king is merciless
in his pursuit of land.

25:43.040 --> 25:45.680
You see that
from his disposal of the ealdormen,

25:45.760 --> 25:48.920
his behavior toward Sigtryggr.

25:49.600 --> 25:54.560
He sees enemies everywhere,
even in my grandson, his heir,

25:54.640 --> 25:58.080
Aelfweard, a sweet Christian boy,

25:58.160 --> 26:02.640
whose ambitions would stretch
no further than Wessex and Mercia.

26:02.720 --> 26:06.480
What plan are you trying to sell me,
Lord Aethelhelm?

26:08.320 --> 26:11.440
You help me raise rebellion
against the king,

26:11.520 --> 26:15.480
we put my grandson
on the throne in Wessex.

26:15.560 --> 26:21.760
Aelfweard, under my guidance,
guarantees no incursions into Scotland.

26:22.400 --> 26:25.560
Your lands are safe, as are his.

26:27.840 --> 26:31.440
I have no interest in playing kingmaker
in Saxon lands.

26:32.560 --> 26:34.160
One king is much like another.

26:34.240 --> 26:40.000
Which is why we would offer
more than just a treaty.

26:40.480 --> 26:45.720
We would offer half the profits
from the lands of Mercia

26:46.560 --> 26:49.400
through a marriage bond
to the Lady Aelfwynn.

26:51.560 --> 26:57.360
The lands are
prosperous and fertile, as is the girl.

26:59.760 --> 27:03.880
Edward is dangerous
and committed to expansion.

27:04.480 --> 27:09.080
He is haunted
by this dream of his father’s,

27:09.160 --> 27:14.200
to unite the kingdoms
in one so-called England.

27:15.120 --> 27:17.480
If you do not strike now...

27:19.480 --> 27:21.840
the opportunity may not arise again.

27:42.720 --> 27:46.600
Leave me to dwell on it
and speak to my commanders.

27:52.160 --> 27:54.120
But do not go far.

27:55.960 --> 27:58.600
You have intrigued me, Lord Aethelhelm.

27:59.440 --> 28:02.000
And that is no inconsiderable feat.

28:08.040 --> 28:11.320
I can do it when they’re asleep.
They will know nothing of it.

28:13.200 --> 28:16.600
We let them live, it will not be a guard
chasing us. It will be an army.

28:16.680 --> 28:20.480
Killing royal women does not end well.
This I know.

28:22.360 --> 28:25.840
But you are right.
If we do not, we will be hunted.

28:31.200 --> 28:33.840
They are planning to kill us.

28:34.320 --> 28:36.120
We do not know that.

28:36.200 --> 28:40.040
We are too powerful
to be left to tell the tale.

28:40.680 --> 28:43.600
They know what forces I can raise.

28:46.000 --> 28:49.800
If we are going to act, it has to be now.

28:58.680 --> 29:00.000
I, um…

29:01.720 --> 29:02.680
I must…

29:04.440 --> 29:06.080
I have no polite word for it.

29:06.880 --> 29:08.080
Take a piss?

29:11.920 --> 29:13.880
That oak needs watering.

29:13.960 --> 29:15.840
Where she can be witnessed?

29:17.000 --> 29:20.920
It wouldn't do well
to deliver your cargo soiled, would it?

29:34.080 --> 29:34.920
Walk.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.160
Now.

29:58.440 --> 30:01.320
- Where are you taking us?
- Sit down.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.320
To whom are we to be delivered?

30:04.800 --> 30:06.000
Answer me.

30:07.080 --> 30:08.400
Sit down.

30:09.400 --> 30:11.920
Or I will make you sit down. Huh?

30:26.480 --> 30:27.800
Do not fight it!

30:32.480 --> 30:37.480
Death is the destiny of all men.

30:41.080 --> 30:45.720
We are not men,
and we are not so easy to kill!

30:51.840 --> 30:52.800
Did you see?

30:53.560 --> 30:59.000
I felt like Saint Michael the Archangel
when he slew Satan's armies.

31:04.720 --> 31:07.640
Begone or I shall slay you also!

31:16.800 --> 31:19.120
Aelfwynn! Run!

31:23.800 --> 31:28.120
No! Grandmother! Help me! Grandmother!

31:37.240 --> 31:39.360
Have them prepare for a ceremony.

31:39.440 --> 31:41.960
Invite whichever Danes
are most appropriate.

31:42.040 --> 31:44.080
Stiorra can swear as they bear witness.

31:44.160 --> 31:46.560
It should calm the waters.
It’s a wise plan.

31:47.520 --> 31:50.160
Why is there not a place set
for Lady Eadgifu?

31:51.840 --> 31:54.680
It was my understanding
you had sent her away.

31:54.760 --> 31:56.080
No, that is not correct.

31:57.080 --> 32:01.960
Well, her servants were told
not to unpack but to turn back.

32:08.240 --> 32:10.800
- Why did they not unpack?
- My Lord.

32:17.440 --> 32:21.720
My Lord, I am returning to Cent.

32:22.440 --> 32:25.000
I am not at ease here.

32:25.080 --> 32:27.480
My love, I would not bring you
somewhere that was not safe.

32:27.560 --> 32:31.960
It is not any danger I fear.
It is your wrath.

32:33.280 --> 32:37.760
So, please, let me on my way.
It is for the best.

32:37.840 --> 32:39.200
Why do you flee me now?

32:39.280 --> 32:41.080
I’m not fleeing you.

32:42.840 --> 32:46.680
I am sparing you the trouble
of sending me away.

32:51.160 --> 32:55.560
We have been both blessed and cursed.

32:58.000 --> 33:02.840
No, it cannot be. It shall not stand.
There can be no more bastards.

33:02.920 --> 33:05.560
I understand, which is why I leave.

33:05.640 --> 33:07.000
Why do you speak so coldly?

33:07.080 --> 33:10.400
Would you have me weep and bawl?
I am not a mewling babe.

33:14.880 --> 33:16.560
I knew what I did

33:17.920 --> 33:18.760
and…

33:20.800 --> 33:24.640
I take my punishment proudly
to give thanks to God

33:24.720 --> 33:27.240
for the small time we have had together.

33:28.360 --> 33:29.400
I said…

33:33.200 --> 33:35.240
there can be no more bastards.

33:39.160 --> 33:41.600
God has blessed us.

33:43.400 --> 33:44.760
I know not why, but…

33:46.960 --> 33:50.120
perhaps this is the reason
we have suffered so much grief.

33:52.920 --> 33:56.320
Perhaps the taking of Aelflaed
was part of this design.

34:00.640 --> 34:03.960
Perhaps he decided that we are to be wed.

34:05.920 --> 34:07.760
Let us fetch a priest.

34:09.840 --> 34:12.000
Love is patient and is…

34:12.880 --> 34:14.560
The love kind.

34:15.040 --> 34:17.960
Love not copies.

34:18.040 --> 34:22.239
Not being boastful. Not arrogant.

34:23.120 --> 34:24.120
Amen.

34:27.400 --> 34:29.159
- So soon, Father?
- Aelfweard.

34:29.239 --> 34:31.600
My mother replaced
while she lies warm in her grave?

34:31.679 --> 34:33.760
God has sent us an unexpected blessing.

34:38.840 --> 34:40.560
So I am to be replaced also.

34:41.679 --> 34:43.080
Aelfweard, return.

34:43.560 --> 34:44.840
I command you come back here!

34:44.920 --> 34:47.120
Allow him to grieve his mother.

34:53.679 --> 34:55.280
Find him. Comfort him.

34:56.600 --> 34:58.159
But remind him of his duty.

34:58.639 --> 35:01.480
I shall not stomach a disobedient child.

36:15.600 --> 36:17.320
I have been asked to comfort you.

36:18.360 --> 36:20.040
There is no comfort, Father.

36:22.880 --> 36:24.360
The king loves you.

36:25.040 --> 36:27.400
Talk with him and you will know it.

36:28.280 --> 36:30.080
His actions speak differently.

36:34.120 --> 36:37.760
He does not want me to be king,
and he felt no love for my poor mother.

36:40.920 --> 36:45.400
What can I do, child,
heal your spirit, hm?

36:47.680 --> 36:50.400
Seek help from me and you will find it.

36:51.480 --> 36:53.480
There is one thing, but you will refuse.

36:54.040 --> 36:55.040
Ask.

37:01.960 --> 37:03.320
I need to travel from here.

37:03.400 --> 37:07.560
If I journey with a priest, I am less
likely to be questioned or troubled.

37:07.640 --> 37:08.760
Journey to where?

37:09.880 --> 37:11.280
To join my grandfather.

37:14.960 --> 37:16.360
I cannot help you.

37:17.600 --> 37:19.280
I do not know where he is.

37:20.840 --> 37:21.960
But I do.

37:23.200 --> 37:24.400
I know how to find him,

37:25.000 --> 37:27.360
I know which men he pays and who to ask.

37:28.400 --> 37:31.200
I only request
that I do not travel to him alone.

37:31.760 --> 37:35.560
Much as I seek to soothe your troubles,
I urge you to stay.

37:36.200 --> 37:38.560
And I would urge you
to pay your debt to my grandfather.

37:38.640 --> 37:42.600
He tells me of those who are his men,
who owe him favors.

37:43.200 --> 37:45.760
I am not Lord Aethelhelm's man.

37:46.920 --> 37:48.560
Would the king see it that way?

37:49.800 --> 37:51.360
If I told him of the debt…

37:55.480 --> 37:57.560
- Are you prepared?
- No.

37:57.640 --> 38:02.280
- Why must I be paraded like a prize?
- It is a show of unity, nothing more.

38:02.360 --> 38:04.880
Do this one thing and it is over.

38:04.960 --> 38:07.240
You can resume your life here,
live as a lady.

38:10.120 --> 38:12.000
I know how hard this is,

38:12.720 --> 38:15.320
but pride is what drove Brida
to the darkness.

38:47.200 --> 38:49.560
Kneel before your king.

38:55.400 --> 38:57.960
I know that it is wise for me to kneel.

38:59.920 --> 39:01.400
But my heart will not allow it.

39:08.040 --> 39:09.040
I am sorry.

39:10.080 --> 39:12.200
I was told you were agreed.

39:12.280 --> 39:14.160
I was trying to honor my father's wish.

39:14.840 --> 39:17.640
But to honor him
is to dishonor my husband.

39:17.720 --> 39:20.720
And it is a destruction of everything
we have built here in Eoferwic.

39:21.280 --> 39:23.480
I do not believe
you will let Danes live here in peace.

39:23.560 --> 39:26.520
If you will not show loyalty to the king,
then you will face the consequence.

39:26.600 --> 39:29.400
- Do not do this.
- You have done this to humiliate me.

39:30.920 --> 39:33.560
I returned to you your dignity.
You would have lived in comfort.

39:33.640 --> 39:35.640
The only thing I want
you cannot give to me.

39:35.720 --> 39:37.480
- Stiorra, this is foolish--
- No!

39:38.360 --> 39:41.160
I will not crumble just to be protected.

39:41.240 --> 39:42.520
I will be free.

39:44.400 --> 39:48.160
And if that freedom is only to face
the executioner’s blade, then so be it!

39:48.240 --> 39:49.720
- I shall join my husband.
- No!

39:49.800 --> 39:51.840
Lord King, you gave your word
on the battlefield

39:51.920 --> 39:53.200
that her life would be spared.

39:57.560 --> 40:01.200
You and all who follow you
are to be exiled from Eoferwic.

40:01.280 --> 40:03.920
Those who wish to stay live at my behest!

40:08.320 --> 40:10.440
But if you are not gone by sunset...

40:11.280 --> 40:13.360
I will not be so generous.

40:16.080 --> 40:18.480
- Stiorra!
- Bring Rognvaldr to me! Have him kneel!

40:18.560 --> 40:20.640
Put a sword to his throat if he does not!

40:21.440 --> 40:24.480
Give me time. I can make this right.
Rognvaldr will betray you.

40:24.560 --> 40:26.200
- You know this--
- Then I shall execute him

40:26.280 --> 40:29.240
and find another and another and another

40:29.320 --> 40:32.360
until I can turn my back
on this wretched town forever.

40:33.040 --> 40:34.680
I advise you do the same.

40:48.120 --> 40:49.080
Stiorra.

40:50.240 --> 40:52.600
Edward now offers Eoferwic to Rognvaldr.

40:53.560 --> 40:55.160
You want this for your people?

40:59.480 --> 41:03.600
He will make war, take tribute,
use the children as his slaves,

41:03.680 --> 41:06.040
just as he meant to
when he brought Brida here.

41:06.880 --> 41:09.240
You give this to him,
you undo all we have fought for.

41:09.320 --> 41:12.760
He abuses the people and the people
leave in search of their true queen.

41:12.840 --> 41:15.400
Rognvaldr will rule nothing.
They shall come to me.

41:16.680 --> 41:20.720
Please do not lose everything
in a futile pursuit of dignity.

41:20.800 --> 41:21.840
I am your daughter.

41:21.920 --> 41:24.560
I was bred to follow honor.

41:24.640 --> 41:27.040
Do not make me do things
that you would not.

41:28.080 --> 41:30.720
Swearing to the Saxons
pulled you from your destiny,

41:30.800 --> 41:34.400
made you the plaything of Brida
and the arseling of the House of Wessex.

41:34.480 --> 41:36.880
- What?
- That fate will not be mine.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.800
Hey, drop your sword!

41:51.880 --> 41:55.960
- Please go to her. Speak with her.
- She will not listen to me.

41:56.840 --> 41:59.400
Her heart is broken, as is her spirit.

42:00.480 --> 42:03.640
- I will pray for her instead.
- Why is she doing this?

42:04.120 --> 42:06.040
What made her so headstrong?

42:06.120 --> 42:08.640
- Do you really not know?

42:10.040 --> 42:13.040
Lord, it’s Brida.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.640
- She has a message for you.
- Speak it.

42:32.720 --> 42:34.760
It was to meet at Loidis.

42:35.280 --> 42:36.280
Come alone.

42:36.360 --> 42:37.960
That’s it? Loidis? Nothing more?

42:38.040 --> 42:40.840
- No.
- I know where she is.

42:40.920 --> 42:44.200
Lord...
Lord, do not do this alone. It’s a trap.

42:44.280 --> 42:45.600
Of course it is a trap.

42:45.680 --> 42:48.480
Our destinies have been entwined
since we were children.

42:48.560 --> 42:51.320
Either she kills me or I kill her.

42:55.600 --> 42:57.280
Take a moment to consider this.

42:57.920 --> 43:00.480
Oh, believe me,
it has been on my mind a long while.

43:00.560 --> 43:02.480
Kill her and her death will haunt you.

43:03.360 --> 43:05.120
Instead you can choose compassion.

43:05.200 --> 43:08.160
I have compassion
for the innocents she kills.

43:08.240 --> 43:12.120
- If I had taken her life before then--
- It is not our place to reason why.

43:12.880 --> 43:15.520
Only to forgive Brida in spite of it.

43:16.240 --> 43:18.160
Hate only begets more hate.

43:18.240 --> 43:21.600
Every death she has caused
since I spared her at Tettenhall

43:21.680 --> 43:23.160
is blood on my hands.

43:23.240 --> 43:26.640
Then you must absolve her of blame
and yourself.

43:27.640 --> 43:29.440
Or you will never find peace.

43:30.320 --> 43:33.480
Swear to me.
Swear to me you will not kill her.

43:33.560 --> 43:36.400
Take her captive.
Make her face those she has wronged.

43:36.920 --> 43:38.360
Father, do not kill her.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.040
I will take no pleasure in it.

43:44.440 --> 43:46.640
It is just the way things must be.

43:50.680 --> 43:51.600
Open the gates!

44:05.800 --> 44:07.800
Good, you are both here.

44:07.880 --> 44:11.480
Lord King, I think our discussions would
be wisest had between the two of us--

44:11.560 --> 44:16.400
We've agreed the principles. Lord Wihtgar
here will help us with the practicalities.

44:16.480 --> 44:20.280
You will escort Lord Aethelhelm
to your fortress as a guest.

44:20.360 --> 44:24.160
There he will prepare the betrothal
and await my arrival.

44:25.200 --> 44:29.720
You will give him every courtesy
because he has promised me much

44:29.800 --> 44:33.440
and would not be so foolish
as to not deliver.

44:34.000 --> 44:37.560
We swore allegiance to you,
Lord King, not…

44:37.640 --> 44:39.280
Lord Wihtgar...

44:39.800 --> 44:41.920
I cannot place you.

44:43.400 --> 44:48.480
I'm presuming your fortress
is one of strategic use.

44:48.560 --> 44:50.160
You’ve probably heard of it.

44:51.200 --> 44:52.520
It's called Bebbanburg.

44:55.000 --> 45:00.440
You are the man that torments Uhtred?

45:07.120 --> 45:11.680
I had expected someone different.

46:39.600 --> 46:40.680
Brida!

46:47.760 --> 46:49.080
Show yourself!

47:08.480 --> 47:09.680
You dig your own grave?

47:12.960 --> 47:13.960
Mine

47:14.960 --> 47:15.960
or yours.

47:17.200 --> 47:18.160
I’m prepared.

47:19.480 --> 47:21.360
Either way, it ends where it began.

47:31.800 --> 47:33.560
It did not have to be this way.

47:35.600 --> 47:36.440
Funny.

47:37.560 --> 47:40.240
That’s what your son said
when he begged to keep his balls.

48:58.800 --> 49:01.040
<i>At some point,</i>
<i>I will see you on the battlefield.</i>

49:01.120 --> 49:02.440
I won’t hesitate to kill you.

49:03.560 --> 49:05.440
It does not mean you do not love me.

49:06.920 --> 49:09.280
Uhtred! Give me death.

49:09.360 --> 49:11.120
Vibeke is waiting for me.

49:24.600 --> 49:25.840
Stop this! It is over.

49:25.920 --> 49:27.440
It is never over!

49:44.080 --> 49:44.960
Uhtred.

49:45.040 --> 49:46.880
Uhtred, kill me. Come on!

49:47.440 --> 49:49.840
Come on. You must kill me.
I have nothing left to live for!

49:49.920 --> 49:52.800
- I won't stop, Uhtred.

50:03.600 --> 50:06.160
Something has died
within me, Uhtred.

50:06.240 --> 50:09.080
What are you waiting for? Kill me, please.

50:09.920 --> 50:10.920
No!

50:12.600 --> 50:13.880
I will not kill you.

50:16.120 --> 50:20.760
If my son could forgive you
after what you have done to him…

50:26.240 --> 50:28.000
…then I must do the same.

50:28.080 --> 50:31.760
No. No, come on. No, do it.
Do it, you coward.

50:31.840 --> 50:34.320
Do it. Do as I ask for.
Send me to Valhalla.

50:34.400 --> 50:36.440
- Do it!
- No!

50:37.040 --> 50:39.600
To kill you
would be to kill part of myself!

50:40.200 --> 50:41.800
We were bound as one!

50:44.840 --> 50:46.120
We were the same.

50:47.480 --> 50:50.040
As there was hope before,
there can be hope again.

50:53.920 --> 50:54.840
How?

50:58.360 --> 50:59.640
We can’t go back.

51:01.880 --> 51:04.680
Everything good we ever had is destroyed.

51:07.320 --> 51:09.000
There’s nothing left, Uhtred.

51:10.880 --> 51:12.560
You’re talking through your arse.

51:13.720 --> 51:16.680
Now you sound like the girl
who I chased through these woods

51:16.760 --> 51:19.400
and humped amongst these trees.

51:23.120 --> 51:24.640
The girl that I loved.

51:27.200 --> 51:28.560
She’s there still.

51:29.360 --> 51:30.400
Is she?

51:33.360 --> 51:34.680
I can’t find her.

51:44.000 --> 51:45.080
I will help you.

51:48.360 --> 51:49.400
Trust me.

52:33.080 --> 52:33.920
Brida.

52:36.760 --> 52:37.760
What have you done?!

52:37.840 --> 52:39.960
Only what you could not!

52:47.720 --> 52:48.880
I'm sorry.

52:50.840 --> 52:51.680
I…

52:54.400 --> 52:55.400
I'm cold.

52:55.880 --> 52:57.000
No.

53:12.960 --> 53:14.080
Ragnar.

53:20.160 --> 53:21.120
Brida.

53:23.360 --> 53:24.440
No!

53:27.600 --> 53:28.680
Brida!

53:34.440 --> 53:35.640
Brida...
