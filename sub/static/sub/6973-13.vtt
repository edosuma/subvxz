Welcome to the land
where silicon meets silicone.

07:22.107 --> 07:25.804
Can I get you a latte from the bar,
or perhaps a bottle of designer H2O?

07:25.877 --> 07:28.175
Scully?

07:28.246 --> 07:30.476
How 'bout a simple explanation
as to why we're here?

07:30.549 --> 07:34.747
Why don't we take a brief moment to feel
the pulse of the new American gold rush?

You're standing on the launch pad
of a rocket headed for the stars.

07:39.391 --> 07:41.325
Okay.

07:45.631 --> 07:47.929
There's been
a little accident.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.434
[Scully]
What kind of accident?

07:50.502 --> 07:52.732
[Langly]
Like an industrial accident.

07:52.804 --> 07:56.262
- How did the victim die?
- It's not exactly clear.

07:56.341 --> 07:58.434
- Right.
- Was there equipment involved?

07:58.510 --> 08:00.444
- No.
- Yes.

08:00.512 --> 08:03.538
- Yes and no.
- What's your business here?

08:03.615 --> 08:05.708
- Our business?
- Yeah.

08:05.784 --> 08:07.911
We're... We're
consultants to FPS.

08:07.986 --> 08:10.887

programming for them.

- This man's been shot.
- No!

08:49.928 --> 08:53.329
See, when somebody is shot,
there's a gun involved, right?

08:53.398 --> 08:58.165
That is absolutely impossible
because there's no way anybody
could get a gun past security.

08:58.236 --> 09:00.500
What do you call this?

09:00.572 --> 09:03.973

- It emits a low-frequency...
- Just let me! All right.

09:06.712 --> 09:09.840
The weapons feed off
the FPS mainframe.

09:09.915 --> 09:12.850
The effect is intensely real,
but harmless.

09:12.918 --> 09:16.718
You say this weapon is a toy, but
this man clearly has gunshot wounds...

09:16.788 --> 09:18.847
- through his...
- Stun suit.

09:18.924 --> 09:21.620

for wounds and kill shots.

- He's dead. I got it.
- Who was he playing against?

09:31.837 --> 09:36.171
Against the game. You waste
the cyber-thugs before they waste you.

09:36.241 --> 09:38.175
It's all about body count.

09:38.243 --> 09:41.041
But they're

in the game space.

digital environment.

09:47.652 --> 09:49.847
Nothing's real.
It's all virtual.

09:49.921 --> 09:52.355

what happened?

09:53.992 --> 09:56.688
I was in the control booth
with Ivan.

09:56.762 --> 10:00.289
Retro was in the zone.
His telemetry was solid.

10:00.365 --> 10:03.801
He looked unstoppable, like
he was on his way to the next level,

10:03.869 --> 10:05.996
when suddenly
he was cooked meat.

10:06.071 --> 10:09.336
Well, the next call's
gonna be to the local P.D.

10:09.407 --> 10:12.934

You said no cops.

10:13.011 --> 10:15.172
You said
you had connections.

10:15.247 --> 10:17.511

exactly what you saw?

- [Phoebe] I'm still
not sure if we even saw it.

10:36.935 --> 10:41.031
I mean, one minute everything
was going perfect, and then we crashed.

10:41.106 --> 10:44.803
Ivan and I were sitting here.
We both just looked at each other.

10:46.378 --> 10:49.040
It happened so fast.

10:49.114 --> 10:50.911
[Beeping]

10:50.982 --> 10:54.713
Moxie's covering Retro, who's
going inside after the enemy
to rack up beaucoup points.

10:54.786 --> 10:58.847
And then "goosh," Retro's
vitals spike like he's been shot.

10:58.924 --> 11:00.789
And the system defaults.

11:00.859 --> 11:03.760
[Phoebe] And they're
right back in the game space.

11:05.597 --> 11:08.760
Lo-Fat, get over here!
What happened?

11:10.001 --> 11:11.935
Retro?
What's wrong?

11:12.003 --> 11:14.938
- Lights out. Game over.
- What's wrong, man? What happened?

11:15.006 --> 11:17.065
What happened in there?

11:17.142 --> 11:20.600
We don't know. There's no
res images on interior game spaces.

11:22.113 --> 11:24.775
What about
the wire frame?

11:24.850 --> 11:26.715
Maybe I can.

11:26.785 --> 11:29.117
I'll strip down
to wire frame display.

11:29.187 --> 11:33.419
Um, I mean...
we've never mapped this area before.

11:33.491 --> 11:36.688

11:48.940 --> 11:51.135

- It can't be.

12:25.043 --> 12:28.444
That ain't all she's packin'.
Can you print that out for me?

12:48.533 --> 12:50.626

This is Detective Lacoeur.

- Yeah, our killer, I believe.

For Frederick's of Hollywood.

13:11.289 --> 13:13.314

you're not serious.

13:13.391 --> 13:15.655
It's all in the computer.

13:15.727 --> 13:18.855
Mulder, that's any voluptuous vixen
out of any number of video games.

13:18.930 --> 13:22.559
She's not in "any video game." She's in
this one, and no one programmed her in.

13:22.634 --> 13:25.831
Yeah, but even if they had,
she's not real.

13:25.904 --> 13:29.965
She's a character. She's-She's
some immature, hormonal fantasy.

13:35.013 --> 13:37.880

You see who that is?

13:37.949 --> 13:42.010

- The O.G.

13:45.523 --> 13:47.457

13:47.525 --> 13:50.961
Word is he slums as a game designer
when he's not contracted to the C.I.A.

13:51.029 --> 13:54.226
- The boy wonder of virtual mayhem.
- What's he doing here?

13:54.299 --> 13:57.666
Ivan must have called him
to go in and slay the ninja babe.

13:57.736 --> 14:00.637

have the effect...

14:00.705 --> 14:03.265
of reducing grown men

- Yeah, that's him.

15:11.975 --> 15:14.739
He just stepped
into the game.

15:16.213 --> 15:19.239
- Why is he just standing there?
- Because he knows no fear.

Preliminary external
examination of deceased,

17:24.974 --> 17:29.412
a 20-ish male,
name listed only as "Retro,"

17:29.479 --> 17:33.415
offers no additional clues
as to actual cause of death.

17:41.391 --> 17:43.859
Scratch that.

17:43.927 --> 17:48.523
Cause of death is from
a large entry wound at the sternum...

17:48.598 --> 17:51.931
resulting in trauma
to the internal organs...

17:52.002 --> 17:53.993
and blood loss.

17:54.071 --> 17:57.598
Wound is consistent
with a high-velocity impact...

17:57.674 --> 17:59.938
from a large projectile...

18:00.010 --> 18:03.036
which passed through
a three-ply Kevlar jacket.

18:09.753 --> 18:12.221
Scratch that.

18:12.289 --> 18:15.486
Wound is the result
of high-velocity impact...

18:15.559 --> 18:17.720
from an unknown object...

18:17.794 --> 18:20.228
which, even if it did
enter the body,

18:20.297 --> 18:23.232
left no damn
trace evidence whatsoever.

No powder burns,
no chemical signatures...

18:26.203 --> 18:29.195

18:30.507 --> 18:34.034
- No luck?
- I thought I was on to something.

18:35.746 --> 18:39.580
You know, Mulder, this suit holds
more than just exploding paint cells.

18:39.649 --> 18:44.382
It measures the player's
vital signs, from the heart rate
to the extant body chemistry,

18:44.454 --> 18:46.615
and then sends that information
back to the computer.

18:46.690 --> 18:51.389
Then when a player is shot,
a battery pack sends a 12-volt jolt...

18:51.461 --> 18:53.793
that keeps him from getting up
until the game is over.

18:53.864 --> 18:55.729
Virtual death.

18:55.799 --> 18:58.063
Yeah. Well, if only
that were the case.

18:58.135 --> 19:01.730
- Yeah.
- I thought at first that maybe
the suit had malfunctioned,

19:01.805 --> 19:04.501
that one of the charges
had blown inward.

19:04.574 --> 19:08.601
But unfortunately,
that wasn't the case either.

19:08.678 --> 19:11.511
I've got a birthday
coming up.

19:11.581 --> 19:15.244
You have to admit, though, Scully, this
is a pretty amazing piece of technology.

19:15.318 --> 19:19.049
- Yeah. Wasted on a stupid game.
- Stupid?

19:19.122 --> 19:22.285
Dressing up like
high-tech warriors...

19:22.359 --> 19:25.556
to play a futuristic version
of cowboys and Indians.

19:25.629 --> 19:29.360
What kind of moron
gets his ya-yas out like that?

19:30.600 --> 19:33.228
Mulder, what purpose
does this game serve...

19:33.303 --> 19:37.501
except to add to a culture
of violence in a country
that's already out of control?

19:37.574 --> 19:40.509
- Who says it adds to it?
- You think that taking up weapons...

19:40.577 --> 19:43.068
and creating gratuitous
virtual mayhem...

19:43.146 --> 19:45.546
has any redeeming value
whatsoever?

19:45.615 --> 19:50.177
That the testosterone frenzy that
it creates stops when the game does?

19:50.253 --> 19:53.689
That's rather sexist,
isn't it?

19:53.757 --> 19:57.090
I mean, maybe the game provides
an outlet for certain impulses,

19:57.160 --> 19:59.754
that it fills a void
in our genetic makeup...

19:59.830 --> 20:02.560
that the more civilizing effects
of society fail to provide for us.

20:02.632 --> 20:07.194
That must be why men feel the great
need to blast the crap out of stuff.

20:08.472 --> 20:11.635
Well, testosterone frenzy
or no,

20:11.708 --> 20:14.871
the only suspect we have
in this man's murder is a woman.

20:16.213 --> 20:18.738
Yeah, I've seen it.

20:18.815 --> 20:21.113
A computer-animated woman,
Mulder,

20:21.184 --> 20:23.482
with a computer-animated
weapon.

20:23.553 --> 20:26.317
A flintlock pistol, which would
leave a very large entry wound.

20:26.389 --> 20:29.790
Pictures don't kill people.
Guns kill people.

20:31.761 --> 20:33.422
As do swords.

20:39.736 --> 20:43.263
The world-renowned
Darryl Musashi.

20:46.042 --> 20:48.306
[Phone Rings]

20:49.479 --> 20:52.471
[Rings]

20:52.549 --> 20:54.483
Mulder.

20:56.086 --> 20:58.418
You're kidding.

21:00.156 --> 21:03.353
- Thanks.
- [Phone Beeps]

21:03.426 --> 21:07.362
L.A. Sheriff's Department just picked
up a female suspect for the murders.

21:13.837 --> 21:17.273
[Excited Chattering]

21:23.179 --> 21:26.205
[Laughing]

21:26.283 --> 21:29.116
Who's the man?
He's the man.

21:29.185 --> 21:31.449
He's the man
with the badge!

21:31.521 --> 21:34.285
You get the feeling these men
have something better to do?

21:34.357 --> 21:36.450
I mean, is that legal?

21:36.526 --> 21:39.017
Uh, we picked her up
outside of a strip club in Reseda.

21:39.095 --> 21:41.029
Fits your description
to a "T."

21:41.097 --> 21:43.998
- Was she read her rights?
- About 500 times.

21:44.067 --> 21:47.059
- [Men Laughing]
- Oh, yeah.

21:51.575 --> 21:53.509
[Laughing]

22:01.918 --> 22:04.219
For the record, can you
state your name, please?

22:04.219 --> 22:05.151
For the record, can you
state your name, please?

22:10.225 --> 22:14.423
For the record again, my name is
Jade Blue Afterglow. I reside...

22:14.495 --> 22:18.488
- I'm sorry. Your real name?
- That is my real name.

22:18.566 --> 22:20.830
What were you expecting?
Mildred?

22:20.902 --> 22:23.063
No.

22:24.672 --> 22:27.266
I sure seem to be upsetting
a lot of people around here.

22:27.342 --> 22:29.833
Well, you're not
upsetting me, Miss, uh...

22:29.911 --> 22:31.776
Afterglow.

22:33.781 --> 22:36.944
I sure upset the man
running the metal detector.

22:44.492 --> 22:48.223
You say that you have
no knowledge of Ivan Martinez...

22:48.296 --> 22:52.255
or a company known
as First Person Shooter, or FPS.

22:52.333 --> 22:54.699
I meet a lot of men.

22:54.769 --> 22:58.637
Would it surprise you to know that you
have been placed at a crime scene...

22:58.706 --> 23:00.799
in the offices of FPS?

23:00.875 --> 23:04.072
Let's just say it takes
a whole lot to surprise me.

23:06.981 --> 23:09.779
You might want to start
telling the truth.

23:09.851 --> 23:12.877
And what truth
am I not telling you?

23:12.954 --> 23:14.888
That you murdered
two men,

23:14.956 --> 23:17.254
one with a 14th-century
broadsword,

23:17.325 --> 23:19.623
and the other
with a flintlock pistol.

23:19.694 --> 23:23.596
Oh. You must have had me
confused with my sister.

23:24.799 --> 23:26.733
Xena, warrior princess.

23:28.403 --> 23:31.270
Are you denying
that this is you?

23:36.844 --> 23:38.971
- Now I get it.
- What?

23:39.047 --> 23:41.481
The medical imaging place
in Culver City.

23:41.549 --> 23:44.780
I got paid to let them
do this body-scan thing.

23:44.852 --> 23:47.844
They paid you
to scan your body?

23:47.922 --> 23:50.948
You think that's the strangest thing
I've been paid to do?

23:54.195 --> 23:57.631
We're very sorry,
Miss Afterglow, but...

23:57.699 --> 24:00.793
Uh, we're sorry.
You're free to go.

24:17.752 --> 24:21.244
I don't know about you, Scully,
but I am feeling the great need...

24:21.322 --> 24:23.688
to blast the crap
out of something.

24:41.075 --> 24:43.270
- Hello?
- Anybody here?

24:44.579 --> 24:46.513
[Quiet Moan]

24:49.250 --> 24:51.411
[Light Switch Clicking]

24:52.487 --> 24:54.455
Phoebe?

24:54.522 --> 24:56.456
Hey, you okay?

24:56.524 --> 24:59.789
Boy, I must have
fell asleep.

24:59.861 --> 25:02.489
I was just thinking
of taking a nap.

25:02.563 --> 25:06.226
I've been up for 70 hours
straight analyzing code,

25:06.300 --> 25:08.291
trying to fix the game.

25:08.369 --> 25:12.066
- Where is everybody? Where's Ivan?
- Um, he's with the money guys.

25:12.140 --> 25:14.074
They're all freaking.

25:14.142 --> 25:17.737
We need to talk to him right away
about a woman named Jade Blue Afterglow.

25:17.812 --> 25:21.612
He scanned her body and he
created the character out of her.

25:21.682 --> 25:23.775
- He put her in the game.
- Hey, what are they doing?

25:23.851 --> 25:25.785
Oh.

25:26.854 --> 25:28.788
The Lone Gunmen
are on the floor.

25:28.856 --> 25:30.915
Langly and I wrote
a software patch.

25:30.992 --> 25:33.893
- We're going to run
a res-up test on the game.
- What for?

25:33.961 --> 25:35.952
To bypass the problem.

25:40.668 --> 25:42.397
- Hey.
- What just happened?

25:42.470 --> 25:44.597
Oh, I don't know.

25:44.672 --> 25:48.130
- They're in the game.
- Hey, Phoebe, are you paying attention?

25:48.209 --> 25:50.609
[Byers] You're supposed to wait
until we said we were ready.

25:50.678 --> 25:53.909
[Langly]
What the hell's going on?

25:53.981 --> 25:56.609
[Byers]
Phoebe, come on.

25:56.684 --> 25:59.152
- What's happening?
- Anyone up there running the program?

25:59.220 --> 26:02.656
I don't believe this.
The program's running itself.

26:02.723 --> 26:04.714
- Phoebe!
- This can't be happening.

26:04.792 --> 26:08.228
Somebody's shooting
at them.

26:08.296 --> 26:12.232
This is supposed to be
background only. There wasn't
supposed to be any game play.

26:12.300 --> 26:14.734
They need help.

26:17.472 --> 26:19.667
Mulder!

26:19.740 --> 26:22.402
[Gunfre Continues]

26:25.146 --> 26:28.445
[Voice On Speaker]
Nine, eight, seven,

26:28.516 --> 26:31.713
six, fve,

26:31.786 --> 26:34.254
four, three,

26:34.322 --> 26:36.654
two, one.

26:36.724 --> 26:39.659
- Engage.
- Bring it on.

26:45.833 --> 26:48.495
- You guys okay?
- We've been better.

26:48.569 --> 26:52.266
- Byers has been hit.
- I'm okay. It's a flesh wound.
[Groans]

26:52.340 --> 26:54.774
It's her.
She's out there.

26:55.910 --> 26:59.437
She nailed Byers
with that flintlock.

26:59.514 --> 27:02.278
Okay, on the count of three,
I'm gonna lay down some cover, fellas.

27:02.350 --> 27:04.648
You ready?

27:04.719 --> 27:06.687
One,

27:06.754 --> 27:08.551
two, three.

27:17.899 --> 27:19.833
Mulder!

27:20.902 --> 27:23.370
Get in the module!

27:31.913 --> 27:35.314
- What is he doing?
- Don't go after her! Get back here!

27:35.383 --> 27:39.046
- He's getting his ya-yas out.
- We're not defaulting the program!

27:39.120 --> 27:41.418
- Mulder!
- It's suicide!

28:03.344 --> 28:05.710
Put the sword down.

28:18.326 --> 28:22.888
[Machine Gun Fire]

28:27.468 --> 28:29.732
[Frohike]
Mulder?

28:42.450 --> 28:44.918
- Oh, no.
- [Door Opening]

28:47.054 --> 28:49.079
Where's Mulder?

28:59.500 --> 29:01.764
I said, where's Mulder?

29:01.836 --> 29:04.532
Maybe you guys didn't hear me.
Come on, guys. Where is he?

29:04.605 --> 29:07.199
We don't know.
He just took off after her.

29:07.274 --> 29:10.801
- I saw what he did,
but where did he go?
- He went into the building.

29:10.878 --> 29:14.143
- He was firing his weapon.
- I saw where he went!

29:14.215 --> 29:17.514
I want to know where he is.

29:17.585 --> 29:22.454
Is there a door or an exit or some kind
of passageway that he could have used?

29:22.523 --> 29:24.889
Just the one
you came in.

29:24.959 --> 29:28.725
- He should be right here.
- It's impossible.
It's a digital environment.

29:28.796 --> 29:31.390
- It's just a game.
- Yeah.

29:31.465 --> 29:34.127
- Easy for you to say.
- [Phoebe] Agent Scully!

29:35.236 --> 29:37.170
I found him.

29:39.040 --> 29:42.567
This monitors everyone playing
the game. There... player four.

29:42.643 --> 29:45.476
- It's his telemetry.
- What do you mean?

29:45.546 --> 29:48.344
Player four.
That's him.

29:48.416 --> 29:50.384
- On the monitor.
- Right there.

29:50.451 --> 29:52.646
- Where?
- That's Mulder.

29:54.121 --> 29:56.248
- He's alive.
- Those are his vitals.

29:56.323 --> 29:58.985
- He's still in the game.
- Yes, but where's the game?

30:42.767 --> 30:44.701
Frohike!

30:45.803 --> 30:48.203
Langly!

30:48.272 --> 30:50.797
Byers!

30:50.875 --> 30:53.435
[Footsteps]

31:26.744 --> 31:28.678
- I think that's it.
- Yeah.

31:28.746 --> 31:31.442
- What are you doing?
- We're rerouting the circuitry.

31:31.515 --> 31:34.450
- Making a kill switch
so we can shut down the game.
- Don't touch that.

31:34.518 --> 31:37.578
I mean, it won't work.
There's no way to do that.

31:37.655 --> 31:42.422
We are back in business!
Baby, you are dope.

31:42.493 --> 31:44.256
What?

31:44.328 --> 31:46.956
We were toast.
I felt the flames licking my ass.

31:47.031 --> 31:50.432
Then the bankers saw
the letters on the autopsy..."F.B.I.

31:50.501 --> 31:53.493
Cause of death: Unknown."
[Giggling]

31:53.571 --> 31:57.473
You fxed our problems.
The game's gonna ship, and we're
gonna be countin'Franklins.

31:57.541 --> 32:00.999
Yeah, and you're gonna
be countin' teeth.

32:01.078 --> 32:04.343
- Her partner's lost in the game.
- Lost?

32:04.415 --> 32:07.851
- The game has disappeared.
- What are you talking about?

32:07.918 --> 32:10.284
Jade Blue Afterglow.
Does that ring a bell?

32:11.889 --> 32:14.016
Jade Blue Afterglow?

32:14.091 --> 32:16.616
- Oh, you'd remember her.
- [Grunts]

32:23.267 --> 32:25.758
Hey! Phoebe!

32:29.840 --> 32:32.934
I don't know
how it happened.

32:33.010 --> 32:36.207
You knew about her?

32:36.280 --> 32:38.714
Then it was you.
You scanned that woman's body.

32:38.782 --> 32:40.716
Into my computer.

32:40.784 --> 32:43.582
She was my creation.
She was mine.

32:44.989 --> 32:48.186
- But why?
- You don't know what it's like...

32:48.259 --> 32:52.252
day in and day out, choking
in a haze of rampant testosterone.

32:52.329 --> 32:54.923
I wouldn't be so sure.

32:54.999 --> 32:58.127
I mean, she was all I had
to keep me sane,

32:58.202 --> 33:01.968
my only way to strike back
as a woman.

33:02.039 --> 33:06.442
She was my goddess,
everything I can never be.

33:06.510 --> 33:08.944
But, Phoebe,
she is still a killer.

33:10.581 --> 33:13.448
I can't explain it, but she is,
and you put her in that game.

33:13.517 --> 33:15.508
No, I didn't.

33:15.586 --> 33:19.181
I was creating my own game
in my own computer.

33:19.256 --> 33:23.056
It was totally secret.
I never told anyone.

33:23.127 --> 33:25.254
But somehow
she jumped programs,

33:25.329 --> 33:27.923
and she's feeding off
the male aggression.

33:27.998 --> 33:31.024
It's making her
stronger and stronger.

33:32.770 --> 33:34.704
I need your help.

33:37.107 --> 33:40.042
You're the only one
who can understand.

33:40.110 --> 33:44.547
- You've got to destroy her, Phoebe.
- I don't know how.

33:44.615 --> 33:46.549
Well, there's
got to be some way.

33:46.617 --> 33:50.246
There's got to be some vulnerability
or a weakness somewhere.

33:50.321 --> 33:53.882
She has no weakness
anymore.

33:55.326 --> 33:57.260
[Sighs]

33:58.963 --> 34:00.897
Hey!

34:07.404 --> 34:09.099
[Beeping]

34:28.192 --> 34:30.922
Bet you think you're gonna kick
my butt up and down the block.

34:34.665 --> 34:37.031
Okay.

34:41.005 --> 34:43.768
Her name is Maitreya.

34:43.841 --> 34:47.277
- Maitreya?
- She's input herself into the game.

34:47.344 --> 34:50.279
- We have to download her.
- We can't even get on-line.

34:50.347 --> 34:52.679
- The system's been hijacked.
- The program won't respond.

34:52.750 --> 34:55.047
[Scully]
Frohike, what's wrong?

34:55.119 --> 34:58.350
- What is that?
- Mulder's vitals are wiggy.

34:58.422 --> 35:01.016
- What?
- They're all over the map.

35:01.091 --> 35:04.117
This is your fault.

35:04.194 --> 35:08.324
- You put her here.
- Hey!

35:08.399 --> 35:10.162
No fair pickin'
on a girl.

35:20.411 --> 35:23.403
[Shouts]

36:01.685 --> 36:04.483
[Keyboard Clicking]

36:06.690 --> 36:10.126
We're back on-line.

36:10.194 --> 36:12.628
- There's no picture.
- No, we're just in res-up.

36:12.696 --> 36:15.221
No, there's something wrong.

36:18.435 --> 36:21.461
- That's not the game.
- Yes, it is. It's level two.

36:21.538 --> 36:23.369
- How did that happen?
- Where's Mulder?

36:23.440 --> 36:26.102
Mulder's in level one.

36:26.176 --> 36:29.703
- [Ivan] No, he's right there.
- Shut the game down.

36:29.780 --> 36:32.874
No, no. No, no.
I can't.

36:32.950 --> 36:35.111
- Well, just turn it off.
- [Byers] Power down, Langly.

36:35.185 --> 36:37.119
[Beeping]

36:46.397 --> 36:49.093
- The computer's not responding.
- Look, we have to get him out of there!

36:49.166 --> 36:51.760
Yeah, and quick.

37:03.213 --> 37:06.341
Whoa!
Stop right there!

37:12.956 --> 37:15.481
That's not really fair,
is it?

37:17.594 --> 37:19.858
Well, that's just cheating.

37:19.930 --> 37:21.693
[Metal Clanging]

37:52.458 --> 37:55.427
- Go, girl!
- Scully's on fire!

37:55.494 --> 37:58.327
- The blood thirst in unquenchable!
- Are you witnessing this?

37:58.397 --> 38:00.592
- Oh, yeah.
- Scully's in the zone!

38:00.666 --> 38:02.531
- Clearly.
- What's wrong?

38:02.601 --> 38:05.195
This is level two.
It only gets harder.

38:05.271 --> 38:08.536
No one's ever beaten
level two.

38:14.347 --> 38:16.872
- Are you okay?
- Ask me if I'm humiliated.

38:16.949 --> 38:19.679
[Door Motor Humming]

38:31.731 --> 38:33.961
Mulder.

38:50.483 --> 38:53.577
- [Byers] This is nuts!
- They'll never make it.

38:53.652 --> 38:56.815
- How do you kill something
that won't die?
- Try and stop me, Ivan.

38:56.889 --> 39:00.188
- My whole life is in this game!
- What are you trying to do?

39:00.259 --> 39:01.988
- Stay out of this!
- She's gonna destroy it.

39:02.061 --> 39:04.859
- It's the only way to save them.
- Let it go, both of you!

39:04.930 --> 39:08.696
- You can save them?
- There's a kill command.

39:08.768 --> 39:11.032
- It kills the whole game.
- You knew about this?

39:11.103 --> 39:13.264
- She knew about it too.
- You said it wouldn't work.

39:13.339 --> 39:16.103
She was trying to save
her creation, her goddess.

39:16.175 --> 39:18.837
You don't care who dies
as long as your game survives.

39:18.911 --> 39:22.176
- Our friends are in there.
- And we're not gonna let them die.

39:46.972 --> 39:48.906
Mulder?

40:18.270 --> 40:21.171
Give me that!
This is out of your hands now.

40:21.240 --> 40:25.040
- Shut down the program.
- You're the only ones that can do it.

40:26.612 --> 40:29.809
- They can't keep this up.
- Scully's running out of ammo.

40:31.116 --> 40:33.812
- What's the command?
- Don't do it, Phoebe.

40:35.287 --> 40:37.346
We're so close.

40:53.038 --> 40:55.905
- The command.
- Give it to him.

41:01.780 --> 41:04.305
Shift-Alt-Blood Bath.

41:27.006 --> 41:28.940
Oh, my God.

41:44.957 --> 41:48.620
We killed the game,
and Mulder and Scully along with it.

41:53.699 --> 41:55.633
Over here!

42:03.976 --> 42:06.103
- Scully!
- Mulder!

42:06.178 --> 42:08.112
Scully!

42:19.024 --> 42:20.958
That's entertainment!

42:31.170 --> 42:33.934
[Mulder Narrating]
We came, we saw, we conquered.

42:34.006 --> 42:36.600
And if the taste
of victory is sweet,

42:36.675 --> 42:39.667
the taste of virtual victory
is not Sweet 'N Low,

42:39.745 --> 42:41.940
nor the bullets
made of sugar.

42:42.014 --> 42:45.780
Maybe out past where the imagination
ends, our true natures lie,

42:45.851 --> 42:48.786
waiting to be confronted
on their own terms.

42:48.854 --> 42:52.085
Out where the intellect is at war
with the primitive brain...

42:52.157 --> 42:54.955
in the hostile territory
of the digital world...

42:55.027 --> 42:58.963
where laws are silent and rules
disappear in the midst of arms.

42:59.031 --> 43:02.558
Born in anarchy,
with an unquenchable blood thirst,

43:02.635 --> 43:06.469
we shudder to think
what might rise up from the darkness.

44:21.078 --> 44:24.014
[Child]
I made this!

44:25.305 --> 44:31.418
