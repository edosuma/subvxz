WEBVTT

03:45.352 --> 03:47.220
This should work for you now.

03:47.320 --> 03:48.522
Mm-hmm.

03:48.622 --> 03:49.822
Yeah.

03:53.726 --> 03:55.495
Mm-hmm.

03:55.595 --> 03:57.763
I knew this would work out.

03:57.863 --> 04:00.333
Sometimes you get a
feeling, you know?

04:00.433 --> 04:01.434
About people.

04:06.872 --> 04:10.177
Right, of course, ok.

04:10.277 --> 04:11.178
Hit me with it.

04:11.278 --> 04:12.279
What's the damage?

04:14.648 --> 04:16.082
Just call it $50.

04:16.183 --> 04:16.882
Come on.

04:16.983 --> 04:18.118
People on the boards?

04:18.218 --> 04:19.085
They talk.

04:19.186 --> 04:20.853
Chat rooms are like
sewing circles.

04:20.954 --> 04:23.099
What if they found out, me,
taking advantage of an artist...

04:23.123 --> 04:23.822
A hundred.

04:23.923 --> 04:25.025
Such as yourself.

04:25.125 --> 04:26.393
A hundred.

04:26.493 --> 04:30.130
I'm going to give you $500.

04:30.230 --> 04:31.131
This one's dead.

04:31.231 --> 04:32.232
Got one I can...

04:46.379 --> 04:47.480
I've got to have it.

04:47.581 --> 04:49.115
- Name your price.
- It's not for sale.

04:49.216 --> 04:50.716
Uses high bias
audio tapes, right?

04:50.816 --> 04:52.285
How's the resolution?

05:01.061 --> 05:05.298
For a while, I felt
like I was in freefall,

05:05.398 --> 05:10.769
stuck in the grips of a dream
I couldn't wake up from.

05:10.869 --> 05:15.141
There were days when I
could feel myself slipping,

05:15.242 --> 05:17.510
like the sidewalks
and the people

05:17.611 --> 05:19.646
weren't really there at all.

05:19.745 --> 05:22.582
Just figments.

05:22.682 --> 05:25.352
It didn't make any sense.

05:25.452 --> 05:27.654
It doesn't make any sense.

05:27.753 --> 05:30.023
So, I've learned it's
what I understand now.

05:30.123 --> 05:32.125
There is no sense to be made.

05:34.860 --> 05:38.665
Maybe I just haven't
looked hard enough.

05:55.715 --> 05:58.451
Can I ask you a question?

05:58.551 --> 05:59.552
Oh, no.

06:02.522 --> 06:04.424
Did he leave you anything?

06:04.524 --> 06:05.525
A note?

06:08.161 --> 06:09.562
For a long time I was convinced

06:09.663 --> 06:11.131
I just couldn't find it.

06:11.231 --> 06:13.566
It would appear in a
place I looked 100 times

06:13.667 --> 06:17.237
and explain everything.

06:17.337 --> 06:18.338
It never did.

06:21.574 --> 06:22.575
I'm sorry.

06:25.078 --> 06:26.279
It gets easier.

06:31.518 --> 06:32.519
What does that mean?

06:35.888 --> 06:37.290
Nothing.

06:37.390 --> 06:40.527
I suppose it's just
a thing people say.

06:40.627 --> 06:41.827
Meaningless.

07:21.101 --> 07:22.268
This is Chicago.

07:22.369 --> 07:24.170
It is the city of
the magnificent mile.

07:24.270 --> 07:26.639
It is the city of the Chicago
cubs and beautiful wrigley.

07:26.740 --> 07:28.108
Field.

07:28.208 --> 07:30.377
It is a city known for its
heated political debates.

07:37.717 --> 07:40.987
We really ought to have as
free of market as you can,

07:41.087 --> 07:46.426
and it's become such a
costly area of pursuit.

07:46.526 --> 07:49.863
And with that, you have
involvement of a number

07:49.963 --> 07:51.164
of local governments.

07:51.264 --> 07:53.899
There is need for, I
think, a minimal amount

07:54.000 --> 07:56.603
of governmental...

08:35.141 --> 08:36.576
What the fuck?

08:39.112 --> 08:41.614
Make sure that
there's stability.

09:33.266 --> 09:36.569
Who is responsible for last
night's act of video piracy?

09:36.669 --> 09:38.738
These video pirates
interrupted programming

09:38.838 --> 09:40.173
with a show of their own.

09:40.273 --> 09:41.884
Last night, someone broke
into regular programming

09:41.908 --> 09:43.009
here on channel...

09:43.109 --> 09:44.549
Someone using
sophisticated equipment

09:44.611 --> 09:47.480
managed to briefly and
illegally override broadcast...

09:47.580 --> 09:49.682
The incident is now
under investigation

09:49.782 --> 09:51.251
by the fcc and the FBI.

09:51.351 --> 09:53.553
When this person
is caught, he or she

09:53.653 --> 09:55.622
will face both civil
and criminal penalties.

09:55.722 --> 09:59.092
While the fcc says last
night's piracy was the first

09:59.192 --> 10:00.493
of its kind.

10:00.593 --> 10:02.930
A week later, the video
pirates struck again.

10:03.029 --> 10:06.799
This time, the target was a wttp
broadcast of syndicated science

10:06.900 --> 10:08.568
fiction series, "Don cronos."

10:08.668 --> 10:11.104
But this time, what they should
showed viewers was somehow

10:11.204 --> 10:13.139
even more bizarre.

11:03.323 --> 11:04.724
You need this for your archive?

11:04.824 --> 11:06.026
Yeah.

11:06.125 --> 11:10.196
May 10th, '87, 11 to
midnight, "Don cronos."

11:10.296 --> 11:13.800
All right, yeah.

11:13.900 --> 11:15.110
Um, you want to just call back?

11:15.134 --> 11:16.135
Or do you mind holding?

11:16.235 --> 11:17.136
No, no, no.

11:17.236 --> 11:18.438
I'll hold.

11:28.915 --> 11:30.216
Uh, hey, you still there?

11:35.555 --> 11:36.255
Hello?

11:36.356 --> 11:37.624
Uh, yeah, yeah.

11:37.724 --> 11:38.591
I'm here.

11:38.691 --> 11:40.094
You know, looking
at the log here,

11:40.193 --> 11:41.570
it seems you're not
the first person

11:41.594 --> 11:43.998
to inquire about
this specific tape.

11:44.098 --> 11:46.799
In fact, we've gotten several
phone calls in just the last...

11:46.899 --> 11:47.800
Do you have it?

11:47.900 --> 11:49.135
Yeah, no.

11:49.235 --> 11:51.738
That specific tape is
confiscated by the fcc.

11:51.838 --> 11:54.942
The computer says I'm supposed
to flag any request for it

11:55.042 --> 11:56.776
and report them
immediately to the FBI.

12:02.348 --> 12:04.217
Think, think, think.

12:04.317 --> 12:05.518
Who would...?

12:26.706 --> 12:27.607
Yeah.

12:27.707 --> 12:30.044
Yeah, uh, Chester.

12:30.144 --> 12:32.046
This is James.

12:32.146 --> 12:33.246
Yes, I'm the guy...

12:33.346 --> 12:35.314
I'm the guy who
fixed your Leica III.

12:37.850 --> 12:39.019
Betamax?

12:39.119 --> 12:40.787
Actually, much better
quality than vhs.

12:40.887 --> 12:41.788
I know, I...

12:41.888 --> 12:43.790
I just... I can't...

12:43.890 --> 12:44.992
I figured as much.

12:45.092 --> 12:46.359
That's why I brought mine.

12:49.096 --> 12:51.965
This is the most incredible
feeling, seeing her again.

12:52.066 --> 12:53.800
Cyrus, you're a scientist.

12:53.900 --> 12:58.538
A scientist deals in
established principle and fact.

12:58.638 --> 13:02.875
One thing we have to accept
is that death is the end.

13:02.976 --> 13:04.610
What do you mean by that?

13:04.711 --> 13:06.646
You've been working
yourself too hard.

13:06.746 --> 13:07.746
- You...
- No, no.

13:07.814 --> 13:09.415
Just wait, just wait.

13:09.515 --> 13:12.318
Locked in this
laboratory for over a year.

13:12.418 --> 13:15.022
Whatever you're doing, it
can't be worth your health

13:15.122 --> 13:16.556
and your peace of mind.

13:16.656 --> 13:18.658
It might even damage your mind.

13:18.758 --> 13:19.759
Nothing is more...

13:59.866 --> 14:04.138
You've become obsessed by
a purely private, impractical

14:04.238 --> 14:05.905
idea.

14:06.006 --> 14:09.176
Assumed that's why
you wanted to see this?

14:09.275 --> 14:10.476
What do you know about this?

14:10.576 --> 14:12.411
The sal-e sparks incident?

14:12.512 --> 14:15.515
Only the creepiest unsolved
mystery hack of all time.

14:15.615 --> 14:17.717
Who's sal-e sparks?

14:17.817 --> 14:18.518
From "stepbot."

14:18.618 --> 14:20.486
You know, the 80s sitcom?

14:20.586 --> 14:22.388
Right.

14:22.488 --> 14:23.923
The one with the...

14:24.024 --> 14:26.592
Widowed robotics engineer
who invents an Android wife

14:26.692 --> 14:30.230
to take care of his
five adopted kids.

14:30.329 --> 14:34.400
It's actually s-a-l
dash e. Sal-e sparks.

14:34.500 --> 14:37.503
"System analytic
lifeform emulation."

14:37.603 --> 14:41.275
Giving androids idiotic anagrams
was all the rage for a while.

14:41.374 --> 14:44.011
But, yeah, that's the
inspiration for the...

14:44.111 --> 14:45.245
It.

14:45.378 --> 14:46.898
15 years later and
they still never got

14:46.947 --> 14:49.549
the hackers who pulled it off,
though some compelling theories

14:49.649 --> 14:51.985
have been floated
across the boards.

14:52.085 --> 14:53.220
The Chicago bbs boards?

14:53.319 --> 14:54.520
Mm-hmm.

14:54.620 --> 14:58.524
So, that means this
tape is very valuable.

14:58.624 --> 15:00.426
One of the only first
gen copies out there.

15:00.526 --> 15:01.627
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:01.727 --> 15:03.130
I have cash.

15:03.230 --> 15:06.166
I don't take money from friends.

15:06.266 --> 15:10.503
What if we made a trade instead?

15:10.603 --> 15:14.007
Listen, I can see this has a lot
of sentimental value for you,

15:14.107 --> 15:15.875
so...

15:15.976 --> 15:20.413
Tell you what, I am going to
throw in the betamax player,

15:20.513 --> 15:21.681
free of charge.

15:21.781 --> 15:22.915
That's very generous of you.

15:23.016 --> 15:25.219
I have another,
better one at home.

15:25.319 --> 15:27.020
So, what happened? She dump you?

15:27.120 --> 15:28.322
Yeah, I got to get to work, ok?

15:28.421 --> 15:29.722
Right, of course.

15:29.822 --> 15:30.823
Ok.

15:46.772 --> 15:49.042
I'd like you to meet rotagrid.

15:49.142 --> 15:52.112
It stands for "random output
terminal analytic gateway.

15:52.212 --> 15:53.880
Remote interconnected
data grid."

16:26.746 --> 16:28.215
This is the nite pirate.

16:28.315 --> 16:29.515
Don't believe the lies.

17:39.953 --> 17:43.957
So, you want to know about the
Chicago broadcast intrusions?

17:44.057 --> 17:46.259
If you're expecting me
to have the FBI report,

17:46.360 --> 17:48.962
I'll tell you the same thing
I told the last fellow who

17:49.062 --> 17:50.197
came here asking for it.

17:50.297 --> 17:53.300
Was it macktheknife69?

17:53.400 --> 17:55.501
That's his bbs handle.

17:55.601 --> 17:57.070
I don't know his real name.

17:57.170 --> 17:59.705
Be careful what you read in
those chat rooms, Mr., um...

18:03.076 --> 18:04.111
James.

18:04.211 --> 18:07.481
Well, James, the only
way I could gain access

18:07.580 --> 18:09.483
to such a report
is the same method

18:09.582 --> 18:11.917
as you or any other citizen.

18:12.019 --> 18:15.355
File a foia request, sit
by the mailbox and wait.

18:15.455 --> 18:16.356
Foia.

18:16.456 --> 18:17.857
Freedom of information act?

18:17.958 --> 18:20.494
Though with their massive
volumes and, shall we say,

18:20.593 --> 18:23.230
limited resources, you
can expect a response time

18:23.330 --> 18:26.466
between six months and never.

18:26.565 --> 18:27.467
So...

18:27.566 --> 18:28.566
No.

18:28.634 --> 18:30.037
I don't have it.

18:30.137 --> 18:33.839
But in service of curious
minds such as yours,

18:33.940 --> 18:36.842
vulnerable to gossip and
rumor on the Internet,

18:36.943 --> 18:40.813
I'm happy to provide you with
a more informed viewpoint.

18:46.119 --> 18:50.457
Broadcast intrusions are a
rare cultural phenomenon.

18:50.556 --> 18:53.793
In 40 years of broadcasting,
there have been less than 10.

18:53.893 --> 18:56.762
The two intrusions
here in Chicago.

18:56.862 --> 18:58.265
The sal-e sparks incident.

18:58.365 --> 19:01.901
The only two cases that
remain unsolved to this day.

19:02.002 --> 19:04.337
Yeah, the tapes I saw were...

19:04.438 --> 19:06.273
Gets under your
skin, doesn't it?

19:09.443 --> 19:12.245
When the fcc reviewed the
footage, they were at a loss.

19:12.345 --> 19:15.415
Nobody could quite work out
what they were watching.

19:15.515 --> 19:16.515
Was it a joke?

19:16.550 --> 19:17.783
A prank?

19:17.883 --> 19:19.785
And that was in early '87.

19:19.885 --> 19:20.586
Yeah.

19:20.686 --> 19:22.456
Yeah, that was, uh...

19:22.556 --> 19:23.722
That was may 3rd.

19:23.823 --> 19:26.193
After the second
incident a week later,

19:26.293 --> 19:27.494
the FBI got involved.

19:27.593 --> 19:28.495
Yeah, may 10th.

19:28.594 --> 19:29.496
Yes.

19:29.595 --> 19:31.398
Seven days in a week.

19:31.498 --> 19:35.035
Conspiracy theorists claim the
FBI put pressure on the press

19:35.135 --> 19:37.104
not to widely
report the incident,

19:37.204 --> 19:40.340
worried that media exposure
might inadvertently be

19:40.440 --> 19:42.442
spreading a subliminal message.

19:42.542 --> 19:44.144
Well, what kind of message?

19:44.244 --> 19:47.347
Something glimpsed
in the wallpaper,

19:47.447 --> 19:49.382
half-listened-to in the voices.

19:49.483 --> 19:52.586
Yeah, but it was just noise.

19:52.685 --> 19:53.886
Static.

19:53.987 --> 19:56.889
Certainly sounds like
static, doesn't it?

20:02.028 --> 20:04.998
There were rumors
of a third sal-e.

20:05.098 --> 20:08.335
Sparks intrusion years later.

20:08.435 --> 20:12.771
But by then we had all but
given up on the investigation.

20:12.872 --> 20:15.342
Do you happen to have the date?

20:15.442 --> 20:16.909
The network?

20:17.010 --> 20:19.678
Well, there are conflicting
reports as to which network,

20:19.778 --> 20:22.282
though if such a
thing does exist,

20:22.382 --> 20:24.584
it may continue the pattern.

20:24.683 --> 20:25.818
Pattern?

20:25.918 --> 20:27.920
Each subsequent
intrusion targeting

20:28.021 --> 20:30.957
a smaller audience, what is
referred to as "narrowcasting."

20:31.057 --> 20:33.527
If it started with
a network affiliate,

20:33.627 --> 20:35.595
followed by a public
broadcasting station,

20:35.694 --> 20:39.232
it would stand to reason that
the third one would most likely

20:39.332 --> 20:41.134
be...

20:41.234 --> 20:42.269
Cable access?

20:42.369 --> 20:44.104
Very good.

20:44.204 --> 20:48.874
I do happen to have a note
here, a reference to the date.

20:53.580 --> 20:58.151
November 23rd, 1996.

20:58.251 --> 21:01.988
Though, I couldn't begin to
tell you the source, probably

21:02.088 --> 21:04.558
because no tape has ever
materialized and probably

21:04.658 --> 21:07.227
never will.

21:13.066 --> 21:16.702
Whoever was responsible...
If indeed only one person was

21:16.802 --> 21:17.903
responsible...

21:18.004 --> 21:20.473
Either died or disappeared.

21:31.351 --> 21:32.252
Oh.

21:32.352 --> 21:34.254
I can't tell what it is.

21:36.855 --> 21:39.925
The FBI doesn't
close cases easily.

21:40.026 --> 21:42.761
And eventually, they realized
they were climbing staircases

21:42.861 --> 21:44.064
to nowhere.

21:48.101 --> 21:51.571
Finally come to terms
with the fact that it was not

21:51.671 --> 21:53.506
your fault. I knew
that it would...

21:58.777 --> 22:00.746
It might come slowly.

22:17.464 --> 22:20.467
You know, I have this
thing I have to go to...

22:20.567 --> 22:22.435
You know, this barbecue.

22:22.535 --> 22:23.536
People from work.

22:23.637 --> 22:25.538
Saturday.

22:25.639 --> 22:27.773
Thinking you could come with me?

22:27.873 --> 22:29.075
Be my date?

22:33.779 --> 22:34.779
Yeah.

22:34.847 --> 22:36.049
Yeah, me, too.

22:38.285 --> 22:41.787
They may be gone, but
we're still here, you know?

22:41.887 --> 22:45.191
Come on, let's just
enjoy that for once.

22:45.292 --> 22:46.092
Yeah, I'm just...

22:46.192 --> 22:48.261
I'm just swamped at work.

22:51.431 --> 22:54.134
Well, if you're ever bored
and want to just hang out,

22:54.234 --> 22:56.869
rent a tape from
blockbuster, or whatever...

23:03.677 --> 23:04.577
I got to get...

23:04.678 --> 23:06.613
I got to get going.

23:06.713 --> 23:07.880
Thank you.

23:07.981 --> 23:09.182
Don't work too late.

24:27.660 --> 24:29.262
I fixed them.

24:32.665 --> 24:34.267
I fixed them all.

27:03.017 --> 27:04.784
James?

28:57.131 --> 28:58.865
It's a set.

28:58.966 --> 29:00.900
Like in a movie or in a theater.

29:01.001 --> 29:03.137
The walls are just panels.

29:03.236 --> 29:04.604
Somebody built this place.

29:04.704 --> 29:06.305
The windows, the
carpets, the walls...

29:06.406 --> 29:08.775
That's why the
figure seems so tall.

29:08.875 --> 29:11.511
It's like room within a room.

29:11.611 --> 29:14.881
Which begs the question...

29:14.982 --> 29:16.182
Why?

29:19.619 --> 29:20.954
Look.

29:21.055 --> 29:22.422
There's a face in the window.

29:26.060 --> 29:28.494
You've really taken these apart.

29:28.594 --> 29:30.329
He let himself be seen, look!

29:30.430 --> 29:32.331
Let me ask you a question.

29:32.432 --> 29:35.135
Why are you so
curious about this?

29:35.234 --> 29:37.403
We had a years
long investigation

29:37.503 --> 29:40.206
by both the fcc and the FBI.

29:40.306 --> 29:41.374
We turned up nothing.

29:41.474 --> 29:43.309
Not the first
two incidents, yes.

29:43.409 --> 29:45.278
But you said so yourself
that there was hardly

29:45.378 --> 29:46.622
any information about the third.

29:46.646 --> 29:48.347
Because there
probably wasn't one.

29:48.448 --> 29:50.583
I mean, who knows how
many people have seen it.

29:50.683 --> 29:53.120
You know, things like this,
they don't happen by accident.

29:53.219 --> 29:55.722
There's always a reason.

29:55.822 --> 29:57.824
Never attribute
conspiracy to that

29:57.924 --> 30:01.161
which is more appropriately
labeled "coincidence."

30:01.260 --> 30:03.596
Look, I am telling
you, they're connected.

30:03.696 --> 30:05.498
Look, somewhere,
for some reason,

30:05.598 --> 30:07.700
this person wanted to say
something to the world,

30:07.800 --> 30:10.003
and he chose this
medium to do it.

30:10.104 --> 30:12.505
Say you're right,
say someone did

30:12.605 --> 30:14.741
hide a message in those tapes.

30:14.841 --> 30:18.946
Do you really want to be the guy
to figure out what that means?

30:19.046 --> 30:20.147
Yes.

30:20.279 --> 30:22.149
This is a federal crime, James.

30:22.248 --> 30:24.017
Whoever did this could
still be out there.

30:24.118 --> 30:25.918
Exactly. Look, look, look, look.

30:26.019 --> 30:27.253
If you look closely...

30:27.353 --> 30:29.255
Look, I don't want you
falling down a rabbit

30:29.355 --> 30:30.991
hole you can't climb out of.

30:35.294 --> 30:37.463
Be very careful, James.

30:37.563 --> 30:39.967
Some threads aren't
worth picking at.

30:46.472 --> 30:47.740
"Drink tonight on me..."

30:57.583 --> 30:59.752
Fired by a fucking haiku.

34:06.006 --> 34:07.307
How old is she?

34:07.407 --> 34:09.309
She's... she's 16.

34:09.409 --> 34:11.311
And she'll be inside the house?

34:11.411 --> 34:12.312
No.

34:12.412 --> 34:13.313
No.

34:13.413 --> 34:15.415
Outside, on the street.

34:15.514 --> 34:17.117
Weight?

34:17.217 --> 34:18.452
Uh...

34:18.551 --> 34:20.120
How much does she weigh?

34:20.220 --> 34:22.456
Oh, um, um...

34:22.555 --> 34:25.092
One... 120.

34:25.192 --> 34:26.426
All right.

34:26.525 --> 34:27.602
I'll let you know what
you need to do after.

34:27.626 --> 34:28.527
Right. Yeah.

34:28.627 --> 34:29.627
Ok. Thank you.

34:29.662 --> 34:30.896
Thank you. Sorry.

35:08.901 --> 35:10.203
Come in.

35:10.303 --> 35:11.304
Sit down.

35:24.084 --> 35:25.085
So you came.

35:35.929 --> 35:37.164
Where did you get that?

35:50.444 --> 35:51.877
So?

35:51.978 --> 35:54.381
You said you can help me.

35:54.481 --> 35:58.918
In 1990, the FBI concluded
an investigation into the sal-e.

35:59.019 --> 36:00.719
Sparks incident.

36:00.820 --> 36:03.656
I have access to
their complete file.

36:03.756 --> 36:05.492
Unredacted.

36:05.591 --> 36:08.128
If you want it, it's yours.

36:08.228 --> 36:13.233
Look, I don't know
how you knew about me,

36:13.333 --> 36:14.700
but I'm not exactly sure...

36:14.800 --> 36:17.204
Don't you want to know
what happened to those girls?

36:20.407 --> 36:23.876
In both intrusions, a woman
went missing just prior

36:23.977 --> 36:25.445
to the signal being hijacked.

36:25.545 --> 36:30.183
Yeah, I read about her,
after you reached out to me.

36:30.283 --> 36:33.453
There's nothing that
connects her to those tapes.

36:33.553 --> 36:36.822
Except that's not
what you believe.

36:36.922 --> 36:38.358
How did you find me?

36:38.458 --> 36:41.361
Do you think you're the
first person to have crossed me

36:41.461 --> 36:43.930
on this road?

36:44.030 --> 36:45.966
No.

36:46.066 --> 36:47.934
No, I know I'm not the first.

36:50.370 --> 36:51.371
But I'll be the last.

36:55.609 --> 37:00.313
Sometimes, in a
situation like this,

37:00.413 --> 37:03.316
rooting around in the places
that you've been rooting...

37:03.416 --> 37:09.322
Let's just say, anonymity
can be a privilege.

37:09.422 --> 37:11.424
Ok.

37:11.525 --> 37:14.860
Say I do want the
file, then what?

37:26.640 --> 37:27.840
How much you want?

37:31.744 --> 37:33.346
Those keys make you feel safe?

37:37.517 --> 37:38.985
I have money.

37:39.085 --> 37:41.655
That's not how this works.

37:41.754 --> 37:42.754
Then what?

37:42.821 --> 37:45.625
A delivery.

37:45.724 --> 37:50.096
An address in Chinatown.

37:50.197 --> 37:52.698
A man will be waiting
there for you.

37:52.798 --> 37:56.102
You give him the
package and walk away.

37:59.239 --> 38:01.608
That's it?

38:01.707 --> 38:03.476
That's it.

38:03.577 --> 38:05.178
I'll know when you've done it.

38:05.278 --> 38:07.948
And if you don't.

38:08.048 --> 38:11.051
How do I know what
you're offering me is real?

38:11.151 --> 38:12.052
Hmm?

38:12.152 --> 38:13.453
Useful?

38:13.553 --> 38:15.888
You don't.

38:15.989 --> 38:18.824
When it's done,
you'll get the file.

38:25.599 --> 38:30.403
Things will be better for you
if you don't know what's inside.

40:15.141 --> 40:16.176
What does that mean?

40:16.276 --> 40:17.711
Do you think there's a pattern?

40:17.811 --> 40:21.348
Do you think the tapes are
trying to tell you something?

40:21.448 --> 40:23.283
They are.

40:23.383 --> 40:25.352
You're not going
to find it, though.

40:25.452 --> 40:29.789
11 years and all I
got was dead ends.

40:29.888 --> 40:31.257
He hid himself well.

40:36.062 --> 40:37.130
You set me up.

40:37.230 --> 40:39.132
You set this up.
You brought me here.

40:39.232 --> 40:39.999
Why?

40:40.100 --> 40:43.603
It's a warning for the curious.

40:48.108 --> 40:49.476
You discovered the women.

40:49.576 --> 40:51.211
Don't start this.

40:51.311 --> 40:52.421
You don't know what it does.

40:52.445 --> 40:54.047
You discovered
the missing women.

40:54.147 --> 40:55.515
The women... fuck the women!

40:58.118 --> 40:59.419
I went to their families.

40:59.519 --> 41:01.163
Do you think they want to
talk to people like us?

41:01.187 --> 41:03.456
You know what they think
about people like us?

41:03.556 --> 41:08.328
You failed, but
at least you tried.

41:08.428 --> 41:10.797
Stop.

41:10.896 --> 41:12.866
Before you realize you can't.

41:12.966 --> 41:14.167
It's too late.

41:21.708 --> 41:23.028
- They're everywhere, man.
- What?

43:12.519 --> 43:13.219
Hello?

43:13.319 --> 43:15.121
I know what they mean.

43:15.221 --> 43:17.056
Who is this?

43:17.156 --> 43:18.959
It's me, it's James.

43:19.058 --> 43:20.995
James?

43:21.094 --> 43:22.762
Got a little worried about you.

43:22.862 --> 43:23.763
Are you listening?

43:23.863 --> 43:25.198
I was right.

43:25.298 --> 43:26.766
They're confessions.

43:26.866 --> 43:30.470
Chicago, may 2nd, 1987, girl
goes missing, is never found.

43:30.570 --> 43:32.973
The day before the
first intrusion.

43:33.072 --> 43:35.675
Same thing a week later.

43:35.775 --> 43:36.910
It all fits.

43:37.011 --> 43:38.111
James...

43:38.211 --> 43:39.588
This guy was
kidnapping these women.

43:39.612 --> 43:40.613
He was...

43:43.182 --> 43:45.251
I heard about your wife.

43:45.351 --> 43:47.787
If I had known when
you came to me, I...

43:47.887 --> 43:49.023
Look, I'm close.

43:49.122 --> 43:50.189
I know it.

43:50.290 --> 43:54.929
Grief can be a
tricky thing, James.

43:55.029 --> 43:56.896
Look, I just wanted
to thank you, ok?

43:56.997 --> 43:58.197
For all your help.

45:16.342 --> 45:17.644
Can I get a rush, please?

45:45.438 --> 45:48.207
Shot of wild Turkey.

45:48.307 --> 45:51.210
One for this guy, too.

45:51.310 --> 45:53.579
Thanks, but I'm good with beer.

46:00.120 --> 46:01.721
So why are you following me?

46:07.894 --> 46:09.862
Take a shot and I'll tell you.

46:09.963 --> 46:11.131
Fuck you.

46:11.230 --> 46:12.432
I'm not in college.

46:14.101 --> 46:16.803
If you want an answer to your
question, you have to drink.

46:16.903 --> 46:17.904
That's the deal.

46:20.107 --> 46:21.307
Take it or leave it.

46:24.677 --> 46:25.678
Fine.

46:31.284 --> 46:32.852
Research.

46:32.953 --> 46:33.987
I'm gathering material.

46:34.088 --> 46:35.288
For what?

46:37.890 --> 46:39.559
Take or leave it.

46:39.659 --> 46:40.660
Another round.

46:46.766 --> 46:49.902
I'm not sure yet.

46:50.003 --> 46:52.139
That's not an answer.

46:52.238 --> 46:53.439
Your turn.

47:04.017 --> 47:05.551
What's the real reason?

47:05.651 --> 47:07.920
Ok.

47:08.021 --> 47:11.024
I like to follow people because
it's something I can control.

47:11.125 --> 47:13.292
It's for myself.

47:13.392 --> 47:14.861
Get to have all the power.

47:14.962 --> 47:18.731
Like cutting, but
without all the mess.

47:24.071 --> 47:25.304
Let's talk about you.

47:25.404 --> 47:28.641
Oh, that would
probably be a bad idea.

47:28.741 --> 47:31.310
Doesn't mean it's
not worth doing.

47:31.410 --> 47:33.379
Every idea I ever
had was a bad one.

47:38.451 --> 47:41.387
What was her name?

47:41.487 --> 47:44.158
Mine was called Benjamin.

47:44.258 --> 47:47.027
I was 19.

47:47.127 --> 47:49.395
God, my mom hated me after that.

47:49.495 --> 47:52.431
She sent me letters all
the time telling me.

47:52.532 --> 47:54.300
But, you know, who
gives a shit, right?

47:54.400 --> 47:55.969
I was happy where I was.

47:56.069 --> 47:58.805
Yeah, and he just...

47:58.905 --> 48:00.473
He got me.

48:05.045 --> 48:06.046
Then what happened?

48:08.548 --> 48:15.321
Ugh, well, I should have
left a long time before I did.

48:15.421 --> 48:17.390
The girls they found
in his room were 14.

48:22.129 --> 48:23.329
Shit...

48:25.765 --> 48:29.303
But, you know, that was
five years ago, yesterday.

48:29.402 --> 48:35.976
Five years, and now, I am here.

48:36.076 --> 48:37.110
Everything is fine.

48:43.516 --> 48:45.052
You seem lost.

48:49.655 --> 48:50.356
Maybe.

48:50.456 --> 48:53.093
At least seem drunk.

48:53.193 --> 48:54.228
Probably.

48:56.896 --> 48:57.896
One more round.

49:00.466 --> 49:02.970
You know, you sort
of lied before.

49:03.070 --> 49:05.504
I did?

49:05.605 --> 49:10.443
Yeah, you said that every
idea you've ever had was bad,

49:10.543 --> 49:15.681
but getting out of that
situation, that was a good one.

49:15.781 --> 49:20.920
Yeah, well, I've made
up for it since then.

49:21.021 --> 49:24.724
The name on my license
ain't quite accurate.

49:24.824 --> 49:28.061
I'm just here because there's
places I can't go back to.

49:28.161 --> 49:29.162
Same.

49:41.375 --> 49:42.575
Hannah.

49:45.012 --> 49:46.013
Her name was Hannah.

49:54.787 --> 49:56.156
Ugh.

49:56.256 --> 49:57.291
All right.

49:57.391 --> 49:58.591
Whoa!

50:54.547 --> 50:56.615
You weren't lying.

50:56.716 --> 51:00.153
You said there's more like this?

51:00.253 --> 51:01.654
Uh, there are three in total.

51:01.754 --> 51:05.491
I'm in an exhaustive
search for the third.

51:05.591 --> 51:06.792
Need any help?

51:09.829 --> 51:13.033
Thanks, but I
prefer to work alone.

51:16.470 --> 51:19.139
What do the numbers mean?

51:19.239 --> 51:21.341
What numbers?

51:21.441 --> 51:24.411
Seven digits.

51:24.510 --> 51:27.414
I guess it's a phone number?

51:27.513 --> 51:29.016
Trust me.

51:29.116 --> 51:33.020
If there were phone numbers on
the tape I would have seen it.

51:33.120 --> 51:35.489
Did you hear it?

51:39.459 --> 51:40.659
Listen.

51:45.432 --> 51:46.500
Did you hear it?

51:46.599 --> 51:47.800
It's morse code.

51:51.104 --> 51:52.105
Fuck me.

51:55.108 --> 51:59.246
Yeah, but who knows morse code
outside of sailors or telegraph

51:59.346 --> 52:00.546
operators?

52:04.583 --> 52:06.086
Ok, sailor.

52:06.186 --> 52:07.753
What's the number?

52:07.853 --> 52:08.921
Let's make a deal.

52:09.022 --> 52:10.689
You let me crash
here for a few days

52:10.790 --> 52:17.531
while I get back on my feet,
and in return I will assist you.

52:17.630 --> 52:19.066
Oh, brother.

52:19.166 --> 52:23.070
In your investigation.

52:23.170 --> 52:24.171
Starting with this.

52:27.541 --> 52:28.442
Ok, fine.

52:28.542 --> 52:29.742
Whatever.

52:34.347 --> 52:35.348
You want to call it?

52:39.486 --> 52:41.121
What happened to your phone?

52:41.221 --> 52:42.522
Oh, I had to destroy it.

52:42.621 --> 52:44.723
You never know who
could be listening.

52:44.824 --> 52:46.725
Couldn't one just
unplug a phone?

52:46.826 --> 52:48.995
Yeah, one would think.

54:09.576 --> 54:10.776
This for me?

54:16.349 --> 54:18.151
Hello?

54:29.062 --> 54:30.063
Fuck.

55:05.098 --> 55:06.098
James?

55:08.101 --> 55:09.402
You've been following me?

55:12.138 --> 55:13.573
You know they can track those.

55:13.673 --> 55:14.807
You shouldn't have those...

55:14.907 --> 55:17.277
It's a burner phone.

55:17.377 --> 55:18.378
Burn her!

55:23.950 --> 55:28.488
She's not going to be
there when you need her.

55:28.588 --> 55:30.056
She's going to be against you.

55:38.298 --> 55:40.233
If you're going to do
this, go all the way.

55:40.333 --> 55:41.234
Why don't you just...

55:41.334 --> 55:43.703
Follow the tapes.

55:43.802 --> 55:46.406
If you're going to do
this, follow the tapes.

55:46.506 --> 55:48.746
The girls are a dead end.
I wish I would have known that.

55:48.841 --> 55:50.241
It's all concentric
fucking circles.

55:50.277 --> 55:52.178
I wish... I wish I
fucking knew that!

55:52.279 --> 55:53.947
Why... why don't you
just come upstairs?

55:54.047 --> 55:55.124
No, man.
They're everywhere, man.

55:55.148 --> 55:56.383
What are you talking about?

55:56.483 --> 55:59.719
They're everywhere, man!

56:49.769 --> 56:51.304
I just need some fuckin' sleep.

57:08.355 --> 57:09.922
- We have to leave now.
- What the fuck?

57:10.023 --> 57:12.168
- Just until it's safe.
- What the fuck was that, James?

57:12.192 --> 57:13.192
Who the fuck was that?

57:13.226 --> 57:14.994
We need to go, we need to go.

57:15.095 --> 57:16.862
- Grab whatever you can.
- And go where?

57:16.963 --> 57:17.863
Out of town.

57:17.964 --> 57:18.964
Anywhere.

57:19.032 --> 57:20.200
You heard what he said.

57:20.300 --> 57:21.935
Whoever followed him
can follow us here.

57:22.035 --> 57:24.804
It's not safe, not anymore.

57:24.903 --> 57:26.172
We have to go, ok?

57:26.272 --> 57:27.173
Hey, ok?

57:27.273 --> 57:28.141
Ugh!

57:28.241 --> 57:29.809
We can't leave
any evidence behind.

57:29.908 --> 57:31.311
It's not safe anymore.

57:31.411 --> 57:32.412
Let's go!

58:57.697 --> 58:59.732
The phone number from
the tape is registered

58:59.833 --> 59:02.135
to a storage unit in peoria.

59:02.235 --> 59:04.904
We leave now, we can
get there by noon.

59:05.004 --> 59:06.004
Ok.

59:13.680 --> 59:14.581
Wait here.

59:14.681 --> 59:15.815
I know how to work this guy.

59:15.915 --> 59:17.116
Give me five minutes.

1:00:14.340 --> 1:00:15.542
Do you have a phone?

1:00:58.251 --> 1:01:02.455
According to this, the
unit was first rented in '87.

1:01:02.555 --> 1:01:07.126
Payment was set up as a
standing order on a credit card,

1:01:07.226 --> 1:01:09.964
and paid every month
without fail ever since.

1:01:10.064 --> 1:01:12.066
Has anyone come
here to check on it?

1:01:12.165 --> 1:01:14.100
As far as I'm aware, no.

1:01:14.200 --> 1:01:16.070
I've been here for 10 years.

1:01:16.169 --> 1:01:19.105
To be honest, I figured
that's why you were here.

1:01:19.205 --> 1:01:22.208
You're the only ones
who ever asked about it.

1:01:22.308 --> 1:01:25.745
They never followed it this far.

1:01:25.845 --> 1:01:27.547
I need a name.

1:01:27.647 --> 1:01:29.449
Does it say who set
up that standing order?

1:01:29.549 --> 1:01:32.619
That I can't tell you, legally.

1:01:32.719 --> 1:01:33.920
You know?

1:01:42.829 --> 1:01:44.564
Hello?

1:01:49.335 --> 1:01:51.771
It's for you.

1:01:51.871 --> 1:01:55.475
If you'll excuse me.

1:02:03.816 --> 1:02:05.052
Excuse me, ma'am.

1:02:05.151 --> 1:02:06.352
Excuse me.

1:02:06.452 --> 1:02:10.423
Apologies, I didn't
get your name.

1:02:10.523 --> 1:02:11.858
Alice.

1:02:11.959 --> 1:02:13.393
This is James.

1:02:13.493 --> 1:02:16.030
Sorry I was rude back there.

1:02:16.130 --> 1:02:18.364
Stephen meyer.

1:02:18.464 --> 1:02:19.532
Nice to meet you, Stephen.

1:02:19.632 --> 1:02:20.934
Um, we actually have to head...

1:02:21.035 --> 1:02:22.301
No, Stephen meyer.

1:02:22.402 --> 1:02:25.939
The name on the rental unit.

1:02:26.040 --> 1:02:28.108
Oh.

1:02:28.207 --> 1:02:30.376
Is that with a v or p-h?

1:02:30.476 --> 1:02:35.682
P-h. M-e-y-e-r. Address
is a po box in joliet.

1:02:35.782 --> 1:02:37.784
That should get you
to him, at least.

1:02:37.884 --> 1:02:42.722
I always, uh, wondered
about that, you know?

1:02:42.822 --> 1:02:44.058
Here.

1:02:44.158 --> 1:02:47.860
Here it is, right here, on
the back of my personal card.

1:02:47.961 --> 1:02:49.829
I'm Brad, by the way.

1:02:49.930 --> 1:02:51.831
Thanks, Brad.

1:03:03.209 --> 1:03:05.812
Left side, third
one from the top.

1:03:08.982 --> 1:03:11.317
Now we wait for Stephen meyer.

1:03:11.417 --> 1:03:13.419
Pray to god he checks his mail.

1:03:22.895 --> 1:03:25.565
Is this all right?

1:03:25.665 --> 1:03:26.666
Mm-hmm.

1:03:36.709 --> 1:03:41.148
So, what do you
do for fun, Jimmy?

1:03:41.247 --> 1:03:42.448
Um...

1:03:47.587 --> 1:03:50.823
I mean, do you have any hobbies?

1:03:50.923 --> 1:03:52.226
Uh, sure.

1:03:52.325 --> 1:03:53.392
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:03:53.493 --> 1:03:57.097
There's a ton of
stuff I like to do.

1:03:57.197 --> 1:03:59.199
Yeah?

1:03:59.298 --> 1:04:02.236
Like what?

1:04:02.335 --> 1:04:03.870
I fix old cameras.

1:04:03.971 --> 1:04:04.972
That's one.

1:04:07.040 --> 1:04:09.842
It doesn't really count as a
hobby if you get paid for it.

1:04:12.812 --> 1:04:13.813
What else?

1:04:18.384 --> 1:04:22.288
I'm into photography.

1:04:22.388 --> 1:04:24.791
It's the same thing.

1:04:24.891 --> 1:04:27.027
Dude, you really need to
broaden your horizons.

1:04:30.897 --> 1:04:33.332
When I was a kid, I used
to make these little radio

1:04:33.432 --> 1:04:34.634
shows in my bedroom.

1:04:37.870 --> 1:04:40.207
I'd record them on
this little boombox,

1:04:40.306 --> 1:04:43.043
and then I would hide them in
the yard so people passing by I

1:04:43.143 --> 1:04:44.343
could listen.

1:04:46.546 --> 1:04:50.550
Nobody ever did, but I kept
on making them anyways.

1:04:54.620 --> 1:04:55.621
Funny.

1:04:57.991 --> 1:04:58.992
Things we remember.

1:05:02.562 --> 1:05:04.363
Yeah, I've been
at this for weeks.

1:05:06.899 --> 1:05:08.101
It feels like forever.

1:05:11.904 --> 1:05:15.875
I can't seem to remember
anything from before, I swear.

1:05:15.976 --> 1:05:18.878
Before when I started.

1:05:18.979 --> 1:05:21.480
Well, sometimes you spend so
long looking for the answers,

1:05:21.581 --> 1:05:23.050
you forget the fucking question.

1:05:28.387 --> 1:05:31.325
I don't know if she died.

1:05:31.424 --> 1:05:33.227
What?

1:05:33.327 --> 1:05:36.330
I wasn't there when she died.

1:05:36.429 --> 1:05:38.531
No real memories.

1:05:38.631 --> 1:05:40.000
Pictures in my head.

1:05:42.835 --> 1:05:44.770
Abandoned car.

1:05:44.871 --> 1:05:45.872
Skyway bridge.

1:05:48.441 --> 1:05:49.642
Empty casket.

1:05:52.645 --> 1:05:55.082
God damn it, Stephen meyers,
pick up your fucking mail.

1:06:21.108 --> 1:06:23.310
Stephen meyer?

1:06:23.409 --> 1:06:24.610
We need to talk to you.

1:06:28.447 --> 1:06:30.083
We found your storage
unit in peoria.

1:06:46.333 --> 1:06:47.533
Follow me.

1:07:55.835 --> 1:07:57.636
We're here about
the storage unit.

1:08:00.840 --> 1:08:01.841
Ok.

1:08:04.543 --> 1:08:05.911
Your name's on the account.

1:08:12.319 --> 1:08:13.519
We're not cops.

1:08:17.224 --> 1:08:18.657
I need to know why.

1:08:26.832 --> 1:08:32.205
When I was a kid,
I had a stammer.

1:08:32.305 --> 1:08:35.409
You know what a stammer is?

1:08:35.509 --> 1:08:38.544
Well, it... you know,
it's not a good thing,

1:08:38.644 --> 1:08:41.148
especially when you're a kid.

1:08:41.248 --> 1:08:45.618
Things might have changed, but,
you know, I turned 15 in '87,

1:08:45.718 --> 1:08:48.788
and all I knew was that it
was hard to make friends

1:08:48.888 --> 1:08:52.125
when you couldn't ask a kid his
name without the words being

1:08:52.225 --> 1:08:53.226
stuck in your throat.

1:08:56.163 --> 1:09:00.599
Of course, one thing I did
have was the bulletin boards.

1:09:00.699 --> 1:09:02.469
There were like a
dream, you know, a bunch

1:09:02.568 --> 1:09:05.172
of outcast kids
bullshittin' about phone

1:09:05.272 --> 1:09:07.074
hacking and old cartoons.

1:09:07.174 --> 1:09:12.379
And the best part is, nobody can
hear a stammer when you type.

1:09:12.479 --> 1:09:14.314
And these boards
were lit up with guys

1:09:14.414 --> 1:09:18.684
who could break into just about
any damn line in the country.

1:09:18.784 --> 1:09:23.856
They called it "phreaking,"
with a p-h. And these...

1:09:23.957 --> 1:09:26.592
These phreakers,
they could be, uh...

1:09:30.030 --> 1:09:32.798
Well, they were
an intense bunch.

1:09:38.405 --> 1:09:42.808
So, I remember one day, about a
year earlier in '86, the boards

1:09:42.908 --> 1:09:45.744
had lit up like i'd
never seen them before.

1:09:45.845 --> 1:09:47.948
I think we all knew about
that nite pirate hijacking

1:09:48.048 --> 1:09:51.051
that signal in Florida long
before the fucking cops did.

1:09:52.419 --> 1:09:53.553
That was beautiful.

1:09:53.652 --> 1:09:55.122
The rumors.

1:09:55.222 --> 1:09:58.624
People either shooting it down
as bullshit or claiming they

1:09:58.724 --> 1:10:00.994
were responsible.

1:10:01.094 --> 1:10:06.233
I didn't actually see a tape
until early the next year.

1:10:06.333 --> 1:10:07.633
Ok?

1:10:07.733 --> 1:10:11.438
I got some kid in
Tallahassee to send it to me.

1:10:11.538 --> 1:10:12.538
Some kid just like me.

1:10:12.606 --> 1:10:15.308
Lonely, isolated, you know?

1:10:15.408 --> 1:10:18.044
I must have watched that
fucking tape 100 times,

1:10:18.145 --> 1:10:21.780
picking it apart,
trying to figure out

1:10:21.881 --> 1:10:24.317
what it is, you know?

1:10:24.417 --> 1:10:26.987
What it meant.

1:10:27.087 --> 1:10:31.857
It was that month, in school,
we were doing presentations

1:10:31.958 --> 1:10:35.128
on what we like to
do outside of school.

1:10:35.228 --> 1:10:36.463
Hobbies and shit.

1:10:36.563 --> 1:10:43.203
So I took the nite pirate tape
in, and I hooked up a VCR,

1:10:43.303 --> 1:10:47.507
and I went about teaching
a room full of 14 year olds

1:10:47.607 --> 1:10:51.478
how to steal a
television signal.

1:10:51.578 --> 1:10:57.651
Teacher was none too happy, but
I don't remember tripping over

1:10:57.750 --> 1:10:59.419
my words even once.

1:11:03.957 --> 1:11:06.526
Growing up, my family, we
never wanted for money, ok?

1:11:06.626 --> 1:11:07.860
Ok?

1:11:07.961 --> 1:11:12.065
We were not rich, but
we weren't poor either.

1:11:12.165 --> 1:11:13.066
You know?

1:11:13.166 --> 1:11:15.335
Like some of the
other families I knew.

1:11:15.435 --> 1:11:18.305
But then there were the
rich kids, all right?

1:11:18.405 --> 1:11:24.177
Confident, well-dressed...
Fuckin' aliens, as far as I

1:11:24.277 --> 1:11:26.546
was concerned.

1:11:26.646 --> 1:11:30.150
Most of them were older than
me, but one of 'em must of had

1:11:30.250 --> 1:11:32.718
a brother in my class, told
'em about my presentation,

1:11:32.818 --> 1:11:36.855
because a few days
later, a group of them...

1:11:36.957 --> 1:11:38.891
They cornered me.

1:11:38.992 --> 1:11:41.760
They had it in their heads that
they wanted to hijack a signal,

1:11:41.860 --> 1:11:42.928
like in Florida.

1:11:43.029 --> 1:11:45.565
You know, make a
tape, broadcast it,

1:11:45.665 --> 1:11:47.968
and did I know how to do it?

1:11:48.068 --> 1:11:49.802
I said, sure, I could do it.

1:11:49.902 --> 1:11:52.339
And not because I
most definitely could,

1:11:52.439 --> 1:11:56.710
and not because I really
kind of wanted to,

1:11:56.809 --> 1:12:02.282
but because they have this
feel to them, you know?

1:12:02.382 --> 1:12:06.752
Like they could just turn
on you at any moment.

1:12:08.989 --> 1:12:11.358
So they kicked your ass.

1:12:11.458 --> 1:12:12.858
They made you do it.

1:12:12.959 --> 1:12:14.893
No, you don't understand.

1:12:14.995 --> 1:12:16.429
They didn't lay a finger on me.

1:12:16.529 --> 1:12:19.733
They didn't have to,
because they had money, ok?

1:12:19.832 --> 1:12:21.701
They talked to girls.

1:12:21.800 --> 1:12:23.270
It was exciting, all right?

1:12:23.370 --> 1:12:25.038
I felt like I was a
part of something,

1:12:25.138 --> 1:12:29.175
and not just from the
edges, like I was important.

1:12:29.276 --> 1:12:32.345
I could do something
that nobody else could do

1:12:32.445 --> 1:12:33.779
and that was a currency.

1:12:36.983 --> 1:12:38.952
This wasn't just some
schoolyard bullshit either.

1:12:39.052 --> 1:12:40.596
They wanted to know
what kind of equipment

1:12:40.620 --> 1:12:43.990
we needed, how dangerous was it
going to be, stuff like that.

1:12:47.260 --> 1:12:49.029
I never knew anyone
else in my life

1:12:49.129 --> 1:12:52.098
who wanted to know about stuff
like this, let alone somebody

1:12:52.198 --> 1:12:54.534
who had the means and
the desire to actually

1:12:54.634 --> 1:12:56.202
power out a transmission tower.

1:12:56.303 --> 1:13:00.640
So, no, they didn't
make me do it.

1:13:00.740 --> 1:13:03.009
I wanted to do it.

1:13:07.846 --> 1:13:09.482
What about the number?

1:13:09.582 --> 1:13:10.583
The morse code?

1:13:10.684 --> 1:13:11.850
Why?

1:13:11.951 --> 1:13:15.221
It's kind of beautiful, how hard

1:13:15.322 --> 1:13:19.159
I worked, to make sure that the
tape never looked back to us.

1:13:19.259 --> 1:13:25.999
But then, what's the point
of fucking with people

1:13:26.099 --> 1:13:27.300
if there's no reward?

1:13:30.770 --> 1:13:32.439
So, numbers...

1:13:34.907 --> 1:13:41.047
The code, all of
it, was my idea.

1:13:41.147 --> 1:13:43.216
Figured if I hid it
well enough, planted

1:13:43.316 --> 1:13:46.319
a little seed on the boards,
people would go nuts.

1:13:47.487 --> 1:13:49.356
So, a week before
we stole the signal,

1:13:49.456 --> 1:13:52.158
I gathered up all the money
they paid me, and took a bus

1:13:52.258 --> 1:13:54.194
to peoria, and I set up shop.

1:13:56.663 --> 1:13:58.264
And I waited.

1:14:01.201 --> 1:14:03.670
You have no idea
how long I waited.

1:14:07.674 --> 1:14:10.009
What was that?

1:14:10.110 --> 1:14:14.180
That is no concern of yours.

1:14:14.280 --> 1:14:15.515
James?

1:14:18.251 --> 1:14:20.086
You got everything you came for.

1:14:20.186 --> 1:14:23.523
James, we need to leave.

1:14:23.623 --> 1:14:25.759
You're lying.

1:14:25.859 --> 1:14:26.760
James!

1:14:26.860 --> 1:14:28.894
Why would I lie?

1:14:28.995 --> 1:14:30.930
No, your story
does not make sense.

1:14:31.030 --> 1:14:33.166
I studied those
tapes over and over.

1:14:33.266 --> 1:14:35.702
Whoever made them is not just
responsible for powering out

1:14:35.802 --> 1:14:37.103
signals.

1:14:37.203 --> 1:14:39.105
You are out of your
depth, my friend.

1:14:42.308 --> 1:14:44.411
Tell me about frederica sexton.

1:14:47.847 --> 1:14:51.484
I don't know who that is.

1:14:51.584 --> 1:14:55.755
You want answers, you have
three tapes to find them in.

1:14:55.855 --> 1:14:57.157
Wait, what?

1:14:57.257 --> 1:14:59.159
- It's time that you should go.
- No, no.

1:14:59.259 --> 1:15:01.070
- Three, you said three tapes.
- I think you should...

1:15:01.094 --> 1:15:02.395
You said three tapes.

1:15:02.495 --> 1:15:03.496
Where?

1:15:06.132 --> 1:15:08.201
Think it's time
for you to leave.

1:15:08.301 --> 1:15:09.669
I need that third tape.

1:15:20.580 --> 1:15:21.581
There's a knack to it.

1:15:27.320 --> 1:15:28.321
Fuck!

1:15:51.845 --> 1:15:53.480
Maybe he just wanted attention.

1:15:53.580 --> 1:15:54.580
No, no, no.

1:15:54.614 --> 1:15:56.483
Then why would he
keep paying for it?

1:15:56.583 --> 1:15:57.450
Huh?

1:15:57.550 --> 1:15:58.918
After all these
years, why would he

1:15:59.052 --> 1:16:01.588
keep it in a storage
unit in another town

1:16:01.688 --> 1:16:04.724
if he just wanted to
fuck with people, huh?

1:16:04.824 --> 1:16:07.060
He wanted to be found.

1:16:07.160 --> 1:16:10.396
Yeah, and you found him.

1:16:10.497 --> 1:16:15.568
You tracked him down and
he told you his story.

1:16:15.668 --> 1:16:16.668
You fucking did it.

1:16:16.703 --> 1:16:19.839
I mean, it's been a crazy ride.

1:16:19.940 --> 1:16:23.042
But it's over now, you know?

1:16:23.142 --> 1:16:26.312
You can let it go.

1:16:26.412 --> 1:16:31.584
Are you... what are you
out of your fuckin' mind?

1:16:31.684 --> 1:16:33.086
Not even close!

1:16:33.186 --> 1:16:35.522
Not until I get my hands
on that third tape!

1:16:35.622 --> 1:16:38.791
And I knew the moment
I called him on it.

1:16:38.892 --> 1:16:41.694
Only thing out of his mouth
that wasn't a total fucking lie.

1:17:06.152 --> 1:17:07.320
You believed him.

1:17:09.990 --> 1:17:12.458
His story.

1:17:12.559 --> 1:17:13.560
I don't know.

1:17:17.063 --> 1:17:18.464
I don't know.

1:17:18.565 --> 1:17:24.070
I'm just saying that, maybe,
he was telling the truth.

1:17:24.170 --> 1:17:27.041
Maybe it was just a
bunch of kids, you know?

1:17:27.140 --> 1:17:28.341
Fucking around.

1:17:35.114 --> 1:17:37.116
Or maybe it was
all just bullshit.

1:18:03.010 --> 1:18:05.745
No!

1:23:14.388 --> 1:23:15.389
Dr. Lithgow.

1:23:15.488 --> 1:23:16.390
Yes?

1:23:16.489 --> 1:23:19.226
He couldn't have been, right?

1:23:19.326 --> 1:23:24.730
I mean, after all this...

1:23:24.830 --> 1:23:27.667
The whole time...
Was right under...

1:23:27.767 --> 1:23:28.768
James.

1:23:32.471 --> 1:23:35.208
It doesn't exist, right?

1:23:35.309 --> 1:23:36.575
The third tape.

1:23:36.676 --> 1:23:38.312
James, this has to stop.

1:23:38.412 --> 1:23:40.347
The pattern.

1:23:40.446 --> 1:23:44.051
Cable access, November 1996.

1:23:44.151 --> 1:23:46.552
Look, I need you...

1:23:46.652 --> 1:23:49.555
I need you to tell me, ok?

1:23:49.655 --> 1:23:52.159
Tell me it doesn't exist.

1:23:52.259 --> 1:23:53.659
It can't be real, can it?

1:23:53.759 --> 1:23:58.031
James, have you ever seen
a 1983 Chevrolet corvette?

1:23:58.131 --> 1:23:59.032
What?

1:23:59.132 --> 1:24:00.499
You haven't.

1:24:00.599 --> 1:24:03.703
There isn't one, because
Chevy never sold an '83 model.

1:24:03.803 --> 1:24:05.471
Does that mean they don't exist?

1:24:05.571 --> 1:24:08.308
There were 43
prototype models made.

1:24:08.408 --> 1:24:10.243
Supposedly, they
were all destroyed.

1:24:10.344 --> 1:24:11.544
Did any survive?

1:24:11.644 --> 1:24:13.879
Only a rabid 'vette
enthusiast would know,

1:24:13.981 --> 1:24:16.615
and only they would have the
will to keep searching for it.

1:24:16.716 --> 1:24:18.617
I... I don't understand.

1:24:18.718 --> 1:24:22.356
Public access channels
don't archive their programs,

1:24:22.456 --> 1:24:25.558
and only someone with a vested
interest would record one,

1:24:25.658 --> 1:24:29.262
so you tell me, James,
does a third tape exist?

1:24:34.001 --> 1:24:37.170
If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.

1:24:37.270 --> 1:24:41.208
If you need help, hang up
and then dial your operator.

1:26:18.004 --> 1:26:22.042
And get it off my shoulders.

1:26:26.846 --> 1:26:30.616
Say the things you used to say.

1:26:34.787 --> 1:26:39.359
And make the world go away.

1:26:43.762 --> 1:26:48.935
Do you remember
when you loved me?

1:26:52.705 --> 1:26:56.309
Before the world took me astray.

1:27:01.680 --> 1:27:09.523
If you do then forgive me.

1:27:09.623 --> 1:27:13.792
And make the world go away.

1:27:18.565 --> 1:27:22.735
Make the world go away.

1:27:27.507 --> 1:27:31.344
And get it off my sh...

1:27:58.871 --> 1:28:01.675
What are you looking for?

1:28:06.580 --> 1:28:09.983
I'm sorry if I hurt you...

1:28:12.285 --> 1:28:16.489
I'll make it up day by day.

1:28:19.825 --> 1:28:26.666
Just say you love
me like you used to.

1:28:26.765 --> 1:28:31.238
And make the world go away.

1:28:33.839 --> 1:28:37.277
Make the world go away.

1:28:41.047 --> 1:28:45.218
And get it off my shoulders.

1:28:48.188 --> 1:28:49.189
Say...

1:28:51.591 --> 1:28:52.959
My arm is hurt.

1:28:53.059 --> 1:28:54.661
I think you broke my arm.

1:28:54.760 --> 1:28:57.197
Shut up.

1:28:57.297 --> 1:28:59.432
This isn't right.

1:28:59.532 --> 1:29:00.433
This isn't right.

1:29:00.533 --> 1:29:01.534
I said be quiet!

1:29:17.684 --> 1:29:19.486
I didn't do that.

1:29:19.586 --> 1:29:20.687
That isn't me.

1:29:20.819 --> 1:29:23.789
You made that tape.

1:29:23.889 --> 1:29:28.561
November 21st, 1996.

1:29:28.662 --> 1:29:30.463
Why?

1:29:30.563 --> 1:29:32.299
I didn't do this.

1:29:32.399 --> 1:29:36.069
November 21st, 1996.

1:29:36.169 --> 1:29:37.170
Why?

1:29:42.442 --> 1:29:43.443
You aren't the police.

1:29:47.547 --> 1:29:49.449
You're not the police.

1:29:49.549 --> 1:29:51.418
Answer the fucking question!

1:29:51.518 --> 1:29:53.253
You're not the police!

1:29:54.920 --> 1:29:57.023
Frederica sexton.

1:29:57.123 --> 1:30:00.527
She disappeared the day before
the first signal intrusion.

1:30:00.627 --> 1:30:03.463
Marie bedford left her
boyfriend's house in Aurora

1:30:03.563 --> 1:30:06.466
the day before a wtpt
TV signal was hijacked.

1:30:06.566 --> 1:30:08.335
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

1:30:08.435 --> 1:30:10.403
And then there was
one more after that.

1:30:16.875 --> 1:30:19.112
And you're going to tell me why.

1:30:19.212 --> 1:30:20.513
My arm...

1:30:20.613 --> 1:30:23.183
I need to go to the hospital.

1:30:23.283 --> 1:30:26.619
Admit you took those women!

1:30:26.720 --> 1:30:27.954
You made those fucking tapes!

1:30:28.054 --> 1:30:30.290
I don't know who you are!

1:30:30.390 --> 1:30:31.991
You took her.

1:30:32.092 --> 1:30:33.493
- I...
- Tell me...

1:30:33.593 --> 1:30:34.494
No.

1:30:34.594 --> 1:30:35.594
Tell me you did it.

1:30:35.662 --> 1:30:38.531
I don't know who you are.

1:30:40.899 --> 1:30:41.899
No!

1:30:41.935 --> 1:30:43.869
You took those women!

1:30:43.970 --> 1:30:46.740
You buried them in the
dirt, and you thought

1:30:46.840 --> 1:30:49.342
no one would ever find you!

1:30:49.442 --> 1:30:51.411
But I found you.

1:30:51.511 --> 1:30:54.948
I connected the dots because
I'm smarter than you.

1:30:55.048 --> 1:30:57.250
And I know what you did.

1:31:13.967 --> 1:31:15.901
What do you want from me?

1:31:21.641 --> 1:31:22.642
The set.

1:31:25.845 --> 1:31:27.280
Take me to the set.

1:31:32.752 --> 1:31:35.255
Take me to the set.

1:32:23.436 --> 1:32:24.437
Is it all here?

1:32:27.974 --> 1:32:29.175
I don't know.

1:32:36.683 --> 1:32:37.917
We need to rebuild it.

1:32:38.017 --> 1:32:39.219
Why?

1:32:42.155 --> 1:32:43.523
We're going to make a tape.

1:33:19.492 --> 1:33:22.095
I missed my
favorite show tonight.

1:33:22.195 --> 1:33:24.898
Can you guess what it is?

1:33:24.999 --> 1:33:27.901
Probably already
know what it is.

1:33:28.002 --> 1:33:31.437
Bet it's your favorite
show, too, right?

1:33:33.740 --> 1:33:34.741
Right?

1:33:39.312 --> 1:33:40.312
Please let me out.

1:33:40.346 --> 1:33:42.081
I haven't done anything.

1:33:42.181 --> 1:33:43.583
I don't want to be here anymore.

1:33:43.683 --> 1:33:44.584
Please?

1:33:44.684 --> 1:33:45.685
Please?

1:33:53.860 --> 1:33:55.128
When will dad be here?

1:34:00.800 --> 1:34:02.802
When will dad be here?

1:34:02.902 --> 1:34:04.671
No, no!

1:34:04.771 --> 1:34:05.805
No! Please!

1:34:05.905 --> 1:34:07.106
No!

1:34:17.684 --> 1:34:19.552
Read it.

1:34:19.652 --> 1:34:21.021
No.

1:34:21.154 --> 1:34:22.889
There's no other way.

1:34:22.990 --> 1:34:24.557
Please...

1:34:24.657 --> 1:34:26.225
This is the only way.

1:34:26.326 --> 1:34:27.760
This isn't... this isn't right.

1:34:27.860 --> 1:34:28.861
Read it!

1:34:35.970 --> 1:34:43.970
"My name is Michael gardner,
and between 1987 and 1996,

1:34:45.278 --> 1:34:51.018
I hijacked the signals at
three television stations.

1:34:51.117 --> 1:34:56.923
"I did this because I..." I can't.

1:34:57.024 --> 1:34:58.092
I know...

1:34:58.191 --> 1:34:59.859
It's the only
way you'll be free.

1:34:59.960 --> 1:35:00.860
No.

1:35:00.961 --> 1:35:01.961
I won't do this.

1:35:01.996 --> 1:35:02.895
Please.

1:35:02.997 --> 1:35:05.398
Read the fucking script!

1:35:10.136 --> 1:35:14.407
"I did this because...

1:35:14.507 --> 1:35:20.747
Because I needed to tell
the world about what I did,

1:35:20.847 --> 1:35:27.353
what I did to these women,
to the women I took.

1:35:27.453 --> 1:35:32.558
The intrusions are confess..."

1:35:34.360 --> 1:35:36.396
Please, please, please.

1:35:36.496 --> 1:35:41.267
The sooner you read it, the
sooner you will understand...

1:35:43.636 --> 1:35:45.371
The sooner you'll find peace.

1:35:52.278 --> 1:35:53.479
Promise?

1:35:55.848 --> 1:35:56.849
I promise.

1:36:16.502 --> 1:36:21.307
"The intrusions are
confessions, confessions

1:36:21.407 --> 1:36:22.909
that I took these women.

1:36:26.446 --> 1:36:27.680
That I killed them.

1:36:34.387 --> 1:36:35.722
I fixed them.

1:36:38.858 --> 1:36:40.293
I fixed them all.

1:36:45.933 --> 1:36:52.805
"And this is my punishment."

1:38:26.233 --> 1:38:29.735
One thing we have to accept
is that death is the end.

1:38:29.836 --> 1:38:32.471
Whatever you're doing, it
can't be worth your health

1:38:32.572 --> 1:38:34.208
and your peace of mind.

1:38:34.308 --> 1:38:35.548
It might even damage your mind.

1:38:35.575 --> 1:38:36.742
You know nothing of...

1:38:54.294 --> 1:38:55.294
Fuck!
