00:59.548 --> 01:02.108
[Carl]... and the guy was just
screamin, so / looked down... 

01:02.217 --> 01:04.583
and I see in his hand
his nipple ring-

01:04.686 --> 01:07.246
and his nipple.
[Laughs]

01:07.356 --> 01:08.983
It's all true.
Fortunately, the guy was drunk.

01:09.091 --> 01:11.651
[Danny] Yeah, but sooner
or later you sober up...

01:11.760 --> 01:13.887
and you're still
missing your nipple.

01:13.996 --> 01:16.556
How'd you guys log that
into evidence anyway?

01:16.665 --> 01:20.396
- Oh, shit, with gloves on.
- [Laughter]

01:20.502 --> 01:22.561
I'll be in the car.

01:24.406 --> 01:26.966
[Carl]
Thought he got benched.

01:27.075 --> 01:29.543
His P.B.A. rep appealed.
He's on the street till the hearing.

01:29.645 --> 01:32.205
[Carl] He's pissing a lot of people off,
not being on board with the captain.

01:32.314 --> 01:34.612
[Danny] Come on, look.
He's got a right to take a stand.

01:34.716 --> 01:36.047
He's also got the right
to remain silent.

01:36.151 --> 01:38.676
- Hey, you with me, Scoob?
- Damn straight.

01:38.787 --> 01:42.814
[Radio: Dispatcher] 1-Tango-17, 242 just
occurred. 762 Whitney Avenue. Code 2.

01:42.925 --> 01:46.588
- [Danny] Talk to you later.
- Yeah, / guess second roll call's over.

01:54.036 --> 01:56.903
You had a gun to his head. He's gonna
tell you anything you want to hear.

01:57.005 --> 02:00.463
- It wasn't like that.
- How can you know for sure
what's going on in his mind?

02:00.575 --> 02:04.033
If Shane wasn't telling me the truth,
things would have gone down differently.

02:04.146 --> 02:06.614
- He was never coming after me. I believe that.
- He's been lying for months...

02:06.715 --> 02:10.082
- leaking all that intel to Antwon.
- He didn't get Angie killed.

02:10.185 --> 02:12.585
Her own mother gave her up
to Antwon before she O.D. 'd.

02:12.688 --> 02:15.316
He had to watch Antwon shoot her,
for Christ's sakes.

02:15.424 --> 02:18.621
- He's sick about it.
- Yeah, so sick all he's worried
about is covering his own ass.

02:18.727 --> 02:23.061
I told him he has to come clean with
everything that happened with Antwon.

02:23.165 --> 02:25.099
Will that buy him
some trust?

02:25.200 --> 02:28.465
- We should hear him out.
- Boys.

02:33.041 --> 02:34.941
[Shane]
Once he had us on the hook for Angie...

02:35.043 --> 02:37.876
he twisted us pretty hard.

02:37.980 --> 02:41.609
You've already seen the highlights.
[Sighs]

02:41.717 --> 02:44.413
And after that, everything else just
seemed like small potatoes, you know.

02:44.519 --> 02:47.682
We tipped off the El Salvadorans
in that church raid.

02:47.789 --> 02:51.020
Muled some China white
from San Pedro to L.A.

02:51.126 --> 02:54.289
Antwon was pretty pissed off
you took down those drug dens ofhis...

02:54.396 --> 02:59.163
and to help ease the pain, we, uh, busted
his competitors, gave him half the product.

02:59.267 --> 03:01.394
And that's most of it.

03:01.503 --> 03:04.131
Antwon have any relationships
I should know about?

03:04.239 --> 03:06.139
Not many that work.

03:06.241 --> 03:08.141
Beaners hate his ass.

03:08.243 --> 03:11.337
El Salvadorans are losing faith.
R.O.C., they ignore him.

03:11.446 --> 03:13.744
Asians tolerate him.

03:13.849 --> 03:15.749
Outside the brothers,
he ain't too popular.

03:15.851 --> 03:21.517
These injunctions and seizures are hitting
him harder than he wants folks to know.

03:21.623 --> 03:25.081
- That's why he needed me.
- What about Army?

03:25.193 --> 03:27.423
He follows my lead.

03:27.529 --> 03:29.429
So he won't blindside us?

03:29.531 --> 03:31.761
No. No, he's-
He's down.

03:34.069 --> 03:37.300
Look, I'm sorry
about that little girl.

03:39.374 --> 03:42.366
But it's not too late
to get her back...

03:42.477 --> 03:44.968
to give her a proper burial.

03:46.381 --> 03:49.873
So basically, you need our help.
Right?

03:51.053 --> 03:53.078
He came clean.

03:53.188 --> 03:56.157
Now it's time for us
to do our part.

03:57.993 --> 03:59.893
- [Army] What?
- [Shane] / told them everything.

03:59.995 --> 04:01.826
- What everything?
- All of it.

04:01.930 --> 04:03.761
How about bouncing that shit
off me? I don't know these guys.

04:03.865 --> 04:05.890
I do, and we can't
handle this alone.

04:06.001 --> 04:07.992
All right, banger spotters
are there around the clock.

04:08.103 --> 04:11.834
Lost souls usually shuffle in after dark.
Place closes around midnight.

04:11.940 --> 04:13.840
We'll find an excuse
to roust the muscle.

04:13.942 --> 04:15.842
- We'll bring 'em back to the Barn.
- But they're all One-niners.

04:15.944 --> 04:18.242
- We bust 'em on an injunction violation.
- How you getting Angie's body?

04:18.346 --> 04:20.576
We wait till it's dark. / just
don't know how deep she's buried.

04:20.682 --> 04:22.673
If they planned on having
the shithouse on top...

04:22.784 --> 04:26.220
- probably not very deep.
- We dig her up, extract our bullets-

04:26.321 --> 04:28.414
We find a really
good place to bury her.

04:28.523 --> 04:31.253
Once we have the girl's body, Antwon
doesn't have any more leverage.

04:31.359 --> 04:36.592
- We go in hard. Put him away for good.
- Or we shoot him for resisting.

04:36.698 --> 04:41.294
This is bullshit, man.

04:41.403 --> 04:43.268
- We can do this, just the four of us.
- He's good. Don't worry.

04:43.371 --> 04:45.362
Let's go.

04:46.875 --> 04:49.366
[Radio: Dispatcher]
1-Tango-13, roger.

04:49.478 --> 04:52.276
Respond to 4556 Alexandria Circle,
Apartment 7.

04:52.380 --> 04:56.282
1 -Tango-17 has been Code 6 on
a domestic dispute for a while now.

04:56.384 --> 04:58.944
- They're not responding.
- [Julien] Roger. This is 1 -Tango-13.

04:59.054 --> 05:01.181
We're on the scene.

05:24.813 --> 05:27.577
Ma'am, are you the one
that made the 911 call?

05:27.682 --> 05:29.741
Yeah, but I told them other cops
they missed him.

05:29.851 --> 05:32.285
How long ago did
the other officers come by?

05:32.387 --> 05:35.254
- About halfhour ago.
- Why'd you call?

05:35.357 --> 05:39.817
Gideon Mazell, my ex's kid, he was trying
to break in. Said he was gonna rape me.

05:39.928 --> 05:43.091
Asshole's been trying to get at me
since / dumped his old man.

05:43.198 --> 05:45.132
Did you see where the officers
went after they left?

05:45.233 --> 05:47.133
[Woman]
/ figured they went looking for Gideon.

05:47.235 --> 05:50.204
- [Julien] Excuse me. /'ll take a look.
- 1 -Tango-17, you copy?

06:00.382 --> 06:04.079
Carl, Scooby,
you guys on foot?

06:21.002 --> 06:23.869
- Anything?
- Canvassed the whole area. There's nothing.

06:23.972 --> 06:25.963
- Oh, shit.
- Half the people weren't answering their door.

06:26.074 --> 06:29.805
- The other half were sleeping.
- Can I use your radio?

06:29.911 --> 06:33.574
Staff 9-Tango. I'm Code 6
on Alexandria Circle.

06:33.682 --> 06:38.142
Be advised we have two officers
unaccounted for. Requesting a tac alert.

06:38.253 --> 06:40.813
- All watches will be held over.
- [Dispatcher] Copy that.

06:40.922 --> 06:44.050
We should notify the families.

06:44.159 --> 06:48.152
[Sirens /n Distance]

06:48.263 --> 06:50.993
[Rock]

06:51.099 --> 06:54.364
[Men, Women Chattering]

06:54.469 --> 06:57.404
[Ends]

06:59.474 --> 07:01.409
Carl and Scooby have been missing at least
an hour. I'm on my way there right now.

07:01.409 --> 07:03.969
Carl and Scooby have been missing at least
an hour. I'm on my way there right now.

07:04.079 --> 07:06.707
Could be the same hunt-
Antwon sending a message.

07:06.815 --> 07:08.783
/f that's true,
they aren'tjust missing.

07:08.883 --> 07:10.976
Retribution for not
killing the cop he wanted?

07:11.086 --> 07:14.487
- We know where he likes to bury bodies.
- Jesus Christ.

07:14.589 --> 07:17.990
All right, you, Army
and Ronnie, stick to the plan.

07:18.093 --> 07:20.459
Find our missing cops.
We also gotta get a 20 on Antwon...

07:20.562 --> 07:22.792
so we can scoop him up as soon
as we find the girl's body.

07:22.897 --> 07:25.457
You come with me.
Let's go.

07:25.567 --> 07:28.536
I want you to go to the end of the block,
keep knocking until you wake people up.

07:28.637 --> 07:30.537
- Yes, ma'am.
- [Claudette] Where do you want us?

07:30.639 --> 07:33.699
We're trying to track down Gideon Mazell,
the subject of the 911 call.

07:33.808 --> 07:36.743
Steve Billings is on his way down,
so pass on to him what you find.

07:36.845 --> 07:40.076
Captain, Steve's good at what he does,
but we've got officers missing.

07:40.181 --> 07:42.081
If they're still alive,
they won't be for long...

07:42.183 --> 07:44.913
and your two best detectives
are right here, right now.

07:45.020 --> 07:47.420
You haven't seen our best game
because of the whole D.A. thing...

07:47.522 --> 07:49.285
but this is too important.

07:52.861 --> 07:54.761
Okay. You're the primaries.

07:54.863 --> 07:57.263
We'll contact the sheriff, see if
they can loan us some bloodhounds.

07:57.365 --> 07:59.492
Tracking Gideon Mazell.

07:59.601 --> 08:02.832
Danny talked to the woman he was
threatening, so you guys get together.

08:02.937 --> 08:04.768
- Vic and his people can work the gang end.
- Where is she?

08:04.873 --> 08:06.932
Apartment 7,
right upstairs.

08:07.042 --> 08:09.476
Julien, / want you to be department liaison,
sit with Carl's wife.

08:09.577 --> 08:12.876
I heard what happened.
I want to help.

08:12.981 --> 08:15.211
Tonight your reserve duty?

08:15.317 --> 08:17.717
No, but I'm still
part of this family.

08:17.819 --> 08:21.186
- Who can I ride with?
- I'll see who's available.

08:21.289 --> 08:24.156
Captain, I knew both those guys.
I should be out there looking for them.

08:24.259 --> 08:26.159
I'm more comfortable
if you're at Carl's house.

08:26.261 --> 08:28.661
I don't have time to worry
about whether you follow orders.

08:28.763 --> 08:31.197
Danny, I want you to take
Aceveda on patrol with you.

08:31.299 --> 08:34.962
- /f there are any problems,
/ want to hear about them.
- Absolutely.

08:35.070 --> 08:37.630
You ever consider this might be
Antwon Mitchell's work?

08:37.739 --> 08:39.535
It's his hood, isn't it?

08:39.640 --> 08:42.131
- I sent some unis to pick him up.
- Call 'em back.

08:42.243 --> 08:44.973
- I'm all over it. He's M.I.A.
- With our two cops? That's convenient.

08:45.080 --> 08:48.846
Give me those unis. I'll sweep up some of
his crew. Maybe find Antwon or our guys.

08:48.950 --> 08:51.009
I can only spare
a couple of bodies.

08:51.119 --> 08:53.087
Look, if / wasn't put in the backseat
on this task force...

08:53.188 --> 08:56.487
maybe I could have stopped
this from happening.

08:56.591 --> 09:00.083
[Sighs]
You did what you had to do. I know that.

09:00.195 --> 09:02.823
I just want
to find these guys.

09:03.965 --> 09:05.990
Okay, I'll have Zerkow
call them back...

09:06.101 --> 09:08.001
- and assign them to you.
- Appreciate that.

09:08.103 --> 09:10.003
I'd like to help out.
You got any gaps here?

09:10.105 --> 09:12.005
Yeah. Check with Dutch
and Claudette.

09:12.107 --> 09:14.735
They're up there.

09:14.843 --> 09:16.936
[Helicopters Overhead]

09:21.416 --> 09:23.543
- We want to talk to Antwon.
- Well, he ain't here.

09:23.651 --> 09:26.745
- What do you assholes know
about two missing cops?
- What the hell-

09:26.855 --> 09:30.552
- You know there's an injunction, boys.
- That ain't no violation, man.

09:30.658 --> 09:32.626
Franklin is a citizen.
He ain't claiming.

09:32.727 --> 09:34.627
Really?

09:38.333 --> 09:42.099
Need me to drop
my drawers too, faggot?

09:42.203 --> 09:44.296
- [Grunts]
- [Officer] Hey, Vic.

09:44.406 --> 09:46.465
[Mackey]
Take this piece of shit.

09:46.574 --> 09:49.134
Fuck yes.

09:49.244 --> 09:51.712
Get them inside
and out of sight.

09:53.848 --> 09:55.816
Okay, go to work.
Back in about an hour.

09:59.554 --> 10:03.320
Gideon Mazell's address.
Captain- I mean, Councilman.

10:03.425 --> 10:06.917
It's just officer tonight.
What can we do?

10:07.028 --> 10:08.928
Pick Gideon up,
and take plenty of backup.

10:09.030 --> 10:10.930
Don't worry.
We'll be careful.

10:12.400 --> 10:14.595
[Man]
Detective.

10:14.702 --> 10:17.262
I just talked to a neighbor who called 911
an hour before the other call.

10:17.372 --> 10:21.035
- What was the complaint?
- Homeless man rooting through the trash.

10:21.142 --> 10:23.804
When they tried to run him off
he seemed unstable.

10:23.912 --> 10:27.643
- Threatened violence.
- Get a description. He's homeless. He's not far.

10:29.317 --> 10:32.286
I'll tip it up.
You push it up and over, okay?

10:32.387 --> 10:34.582
Okay.

10:35.723 --> 10:38.783
[Grunting]

10:39.928 --> 10:43.091
- Ugh! Goddamn it.
- That is rank.

10:45.133 --> 10:46.998
You can do the digging.

10:50.238 --> 10:52.229
Okay, fine.

10:59.614 --> 11:02.310
No sign of our cops,
and the girl's body wasn't there.

11:02.417 --> 11:05.750
- What do you mean?
- Shallow grave, empty. Somebody moved her.

11:05.854 --> 11:08.755
- Halpern tipped Antwon.
- No way. We've been taking turns
watching that place...

11:08.857 --> 11:11.519
- around the clock since he showed it to us.
- Halpern lied?

11:11.626 --> 11:13.856
Then maybe the body
was never there.

11:13.962 --> 11:16.021
- No, he moved it and didn't tell him about it.
- [Army] Now what?

11:16.130 --> 11:19.531
Can't find the don,
you go visit Fredo.

11:22.837 --> 11:26.136
- Yo, what're you working?
- Same as you.

11:26.241 --> 11:28.937
Captain talked to Dutch and Claudette.
Put 'em onto Antwon.

11:29.043 --> 11:31.637
- They got me tracking him down.
- You hear something, give us a heads-up.

11:31.746 --> 11:34.306
Yeah.

11:34.415 --> 11:37.282
Look, I'm trying.
You're not making it easy.

11:37.385 --> 11:39.285
Keep trying.

11:42.457 --> 11:44.322
Why you got me locked down?

11:44.425 --> 11:46.416
Officers who brought you in
said you got a little... physical.

11:46.528 --> 11:48.428
'Cause / didn't do nothin'
to deserve this.

11:48.530 --> 11:50.430
Twice arrested for intent
to distribute steroids.

11:50.532 --> 11:53.296
That your One-niner
connection?

11:53.401 --> 11:55.801
You and a couple of them run into
two of our police officers tonight?

11:55.904 --> 11:58.065
- Shit no.
- Maybe you went over to Lydia Quall's place...

11:58.172 --> 12:00.936
- looking to get a little physical too.
- Lydia?

12:01.042 --> 12:03.101
- She the one trying to get physical with me.
- With you?

12:03.211 --> 12:05.111
- Yeah.
- She's dating your father.

12:05.213 --> 12:07.738
Left him, thinking she
could have the 2005 model.

12:07.849 --> 12:10.579
- / told her / was straight.
- If she's the one chasing you...

12:10.685 --> 12:13.654
how come she's calling 911 trying
to stop you from breaking into her house?

12:13.755 --> 12:16.918
- What you talking about?
- Officers respond, they go missing.

12:17.025 --> 12:20.188
Take somebody pretty strong
to corral the two of them.

12:20.295 --> 12:22.195
- What time we talking?
- Few hours ago.

12:22.297 --> 12:25.733
No, no, no. I was over
at Greg Hockler's place all night...

12:25.833 --> 12:28.768
- shooting up with stanozol.
- Steroids?

12:28.870 --> 12:31.532
Got fresh track marks
on my ass to prove it.

12:31.639 --> 12:34.608
[Scoffs]
Looks like you could use a little juice...

12:34.709 --> 12:37.701
buddy.

12:37.812 --> 12:40.610
- You lied to us, Lydia.
- We have two officers missing.

12:40.715 --> 12:43.548
So we don't have time
for goddamn liars.

12:43.651 --> 12:46.279
Gideon was nowhere near
your place when you called 911.

12:46.387 --> 12:48.287
You lured those officers there.

12:48.389 --> 12:50.949
You told them some bullshit story
about some guy harassing you...

12:51.059 --> 12:53.084
and when you left your place...

12:53.194 --> 12:55.992
- there was somebody else waiting for them.
- No!

12:56.097 --> 12:57.792
Where are they, Lydia?

12:57.899 --> 12:59.799
We are gonna lock...

12:59.901 --> 13:03.564
that fat ass of yours in a cage
for the rest of your life...

13:03.671 --> 13:06.105
- unless you tell us right now.
- / didn't lure no one.

13:06.207 --> 13:09.040
I was just trying
to set up Gideon.

13:09.143 --> 13:11.338
Figured if I got him
into some trouble with the law...

13:11.446 --> 13:13.346
then he'd have
to talk with me...

13:13.448 --> 13:18.078
and I'd drop the charges if he got
a little friendlier, you know?

13:18.186 --> 13:22.088
I was looking to get the man in my bed,
not mess with no cops.

13:25.660 --> 13:28.561
Thank you. We'll return the favor
if you ever need it. Good-bye.

13:28.663 --> 13:32.326
Sheriff s office is sending over
six more officers.

13:32.433 --> 13:35.425
- What'd you get upstairs?
- Bodybuilder and his paramour weren't involved.

13:35.536 --> 13:37.766
- So we're back to square one.
- We've ruled some people out.

13:37.872 --> 13:40.170
- We have to rule some people in.
- We knew whoever did this...

13:40.274 --> 13:41.969
had a reason for being
on that block.

13:42.076 --> 13:43.976
Mm-hmm.
Statements from neighbors?

13:44.078 --> 13:47.741
Oh, yeah. Look, I've been over this.
Nothing stands out.

13:47.849 --> 13:50.818
- / was gonna go through them again.
- [Monica] Do it in person.

13:50.918 --> 13:53.887
Knock on the doors yourself.

13:53.988 --> 13:55.922
We might have something.

14:00.094 --> 14:03.894
Well, like I told the other
law enforcement agents...

14:03.998 --> 14:07.058
uh, one was tall...

14:07.168 --> 14:09.398
uh, African-American.

14:09.504 --> 14:13.235
Uh, the shorter of the two
appeared white initially...

14:13.341 --> 14:16.242
then I realized...

14:16.344 --> 14:19.404
he was Asian.
[Laughs]

14:19.514 --> 14:21.414
Marco Polo.

14:24.018 --> 14:26.919
Did you see the officers
go into the apartment building?

14:27.021 --> 14:28.921
Yes, ma'am.

14:29.023 --> 14:32.618
- [Dutch] Did you see them come out?
- [Clears Throat]

14:32.727 --> 14:35.389
[Claudette]
Can you answer the question, Roger?

14:35.496 --> 14:38.761
May / see a badge number,
please?

14:43.371 --> 14:47.034
[Claudette] Did you see the officers
come out of the building, yes or no?

14:47.141 --> 14:49.405
I am going to need
one of those...

14:49.510 --> 14:52.343
before I can be debriefed
in the category.

14:52.447 --> 14:55.473
Civilians don't have badges.

14:56.884 --> 14:58.784
When I get my badge...

14:58.886 --> 15:02.720
all things will be made known...

15:02.824 --> 15:04.951
peace officer to peace officer.

15:08.096 --> 15:10.064
- Hey, Corrine.
- Hi.

15:10.164 --> 15:12.724
- What's going on?
- We're looking for a black banger, 20s...

15:12.834 --> 15:16.099
- came in here last night.
- This tied to those missing cops?

15:16.204 --> 15:19.196
It might be. You got any
gunshot wounds in here?

15:19.307 --> 15:21.434
- Only about 100.
- Check for a Halpern White.

15:21.542 --> 15:23.976
Gimme a sec.

15:26.314 --> 15:28.908
Gunshot wound to the shoulder.
Lost lots of blood.

15:29.016 --> 15:31.416
Stabilized this morning.
Moved to the fourth floor.

15:31.519 --> 15:33.578
- Talking?
- On a morphine drip.

15:33.688 --> 15:36.919
He's happy. Not sure how much
talking he's doing.

15:37.024 --> 15:40.357
So, any word
on those missing men?

15:40.461 --> 15:43.089
Uh, no, but we could use
a favor with that.

15:54.208 --> 15:56.108
That felt creepy.

15:56.210 --> 15:59.111
- It's for a good cause.
- Thank you. Thank you.

15:59.213 --> 16:02.376
Hey, I see you got
that lift to the E.R.

16:02.483 --> 16:05.384
- What the hell you want?
- Did you say Angie's body was
under the goddamn outhouse.

16:05.486 --> 16:07.386
- It is.
- No, it ain't. We looked.

16:07.488 --> 16:10.184
Antwon must have
hauled it out.

16:10.291 --> 16:14.591
- [Groans]
- Question is, where to?

16:14.695 --> 16:16.720
Same place he's stashing
the two cops?

16:16.831 --> 16:20.426
- What cops?
- You'd best be coming up with some answers...

16:20.535 --> 16:23.800
or a copy of this C.I. contract
you just signed...

16:23.905 --> 16:25.930
gets nailed to the door
of Antwon's community center.

16:26.040 --> 16:27.940
- [Groans]
- Next time you sign insurance waivers...

16:28.042 --> 16:30.442
you should read
the fine print.

16:30.545 --> 16:33.742
Some paper, signed or not, ain't gonna
make my clique turn against me.

16:33.848 --> 16:37.807
- [Groans]
- You just took a bullet. Almost died.

16:37.919 --> 16:40.911
I hear you found Jesus,
saw the error of your ways.

16:41.022 --> 16:46.790
- Started giving it up to Mr. Man
to get a fresh start.
- [Coughing]

16:46.894 --> 16:49.658
You know the thug code-
"Trust no one.

16:49.764 --> 16:52.426
Kill your buddy
before he kills you."

16:52.533 --> 16:54.933
That's what separates us
from you.

16:58.706 --> 17:01.732
Antwon wouldn't use his own crew
for that kind of shit.

17:01.843 --> 17:05.869
He farms it out. They got a contract
with the El Salvadorans.

17:05.980 --> 17:08.972
With you laid up,
who would he reach out with?

17:09.083 --> 17:12.018
I doubt he went direct.

17:12.118 --> 17:15.555
I don't know who
he'd use as a middleman.

17:15.656 --> 17:18.784
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:18.893 --> 17:21.123
You won't be able
to make any phone calls...

17:22.463 --> 17:24.431
but you won't care.

17:33.674 --> 17:36.643
Uh, would you do...

17:36.744 --> 17:38.644
the honors?

17:46.520 --> 17:49.785
What happened after the officers
came out of the apartment building?

17:51.859 --> 17:54.760
[Clears Throat]
Uh-

17:54.862 --> 17:58.423
The officers in question were
approached by a series of individuals.

17:58.532 --> 18:00.432
[Claudette]
How many?

18:00.534 --> 18:05.870
Three to seven.
Difficult to say with accuracy.

18:05.973 --> 18:09.431
Low luminous environment.

18:09.543 --> 18:12.478
- Where were you in relation to the police car?
- /'d say, uh...

18:12.580 --> 18:14.810
forty meters east southwest.

18:14.916 --> 18:17.680
[Claudette]
What were you doing there?

18:17.785 --> 18:20.049
Routine surveillance.

18:20.154 --> 18:24.056
Uh, monitoring bursts
of non-visible light...

18:24.158 --> 18:26.058
in the 800-angstrom range.

18:26.160 --> 18:28.355
High dispersion and so forth.

18:28.462 --> 18:31.329
Roger, I need you
to be honest with me-

18:31.432 --> 18:33.400
detective to detective.

18:33.501 --> 18:36.732
Did you have anything
to do with this?

18:36.837 --> 18:39.032
No, sir, I did not.

18:39.140 --> 18:42.371
What happened
to those police officers?

18:42.476 --> 18:44.467
Hmph.

18:45.680 --> 18:47.910
[Dutch]
These men have families...

18:48.015 --> 18:49.915
that are very worried
about them.

18:50.017 --> 18:54.750
We all have a level three
clearance here, correct?

18:54.855 --> 18:57.915
No. I'm still at level two.

19:02.797 --> 19:05.061
Roger.

19:05.166 --> 19:07.191
Level three.

19:10.471 --> 19:14.202
Foreign operatives are
using the fault lines...

19:14.308 --> 19:16.469
to destabilize
the gravity shelf.

19:16.577 --> 19:18.704
9/11 all over again.

19:18.813 --> 19:21.805
So these people you saw,
they were, uh...

19:21.916 --> 19:23.816
foreign agents?

19:23.918 --> 19:27.718
Uh, they, uh-
They travel along the fault lines...

19:27.822 --> 19:30.052
to evade detection.

19:30.157 --> 19:33.456
There are easier ways
to knock down a skyscraper...

19:33.561 --> 19:36.223
than flying aircraft into it-

19:36.330 --> 19:39.265
Uh, subduction,
uh, slip strike manipulation...

19:39.367 --> 19:42.268
mantle failure and so forth.

19:42.370 --> 19:44.270
That building is coming down.

19:44.372 --> 19:46.602
- /t's coming down, all right.
- Got it. Got it.

19:48.409 --> 19:51.606
Officer, deploy the swing shift
without roll call- everyone on the street.

19:51.712 --> 19:54.408
And no petty busts. I don't want anybody
holed up with paperwork here.

19:54.515 --> 19:57.450
- So, did he give us anything?
- Hmm.

19:57.551 --> 20:00.384
Alien abduction in the hood is more
plausible than anything he had to say.

20:00.488 --> 20:02.479
He studied string theory
before going off the deep end.

20:02.590 --> 20:05.286
Send him to County
for observation.

20:05.393 --> 20:08.157
The one thing we do know is he saw
our cops. We should keep him here.

20:08.262 --> 20:10.822
- The man's psychotic.
- He's our only witness.

20:15.069 --> 20:19.130
- When does /.N.S. send your ass back?
- Supposed to be three days ago.

20:19.240 --> 20:21.435
Behind schedule. Why?

20:21.542 --> 20:24.943
I can keep you off that bus-
keep you in the U.S.

20:25.046 --> 20:29.779
Two cops have gone missing.
/.N.S. is helping the police.

20:29.884 --> 20:33.911
- What do you need me for?
- /nformation. Antwon Mitchell.

20:34.021 --> 20:36.717
If he wanted to grab some cops,
who'd he use from your set?

20:38.592 --> 20:40.492
You could really
get me out of here?

20:40.594 --> 20:42.789
Free pass comes
right from the top.

20:42.897 --> 20:45.263
Chief signed it himself.

20:48.402 --> 20:51.803
Name's Pitarrio.
Knew Antwon in prison.

20:51.906 --> 20:55.103
- He's his go-to on all the ugly shit.
- Where can I find him?

21:01.782 --> 21:04.410
I need to look for him.

21:04.518 --> 21:07.510
You need to stay here
in case Carl calls.

21:13.527 --> 21:16.553
You know, he's been
coming home...

21:16.664 --> 21:18.928
every night...

21:19.033 --> 21:21.763
talking about how things
are more dangerous out there.

21:21.869 --> 21:24.429
I mean, what did your captain
think would happen?

21:24.538 --> 21:26.768
You push people long enough,
they push back.

21:26.874 --> 21:28.967
Things weren't
working before.

21:29.076 --> 21:30.976
She's just trying
something different.

21:31.078 --> 21:33.273
Things were working fine
before.

21:33.380 --> 21:35.439
Carl came home every night.

21:36.550 --> 21:38.609
He's out there.

21:38.719 --> 21:40.619
Alive.

21:42.089 --> 21:45.752
- I can feel it.
- Then we'll find him.

21:54.168 --> 21:56.068
What's up, Queenie?

21:56.170 --> 21:58.468
Daddy, am I glad you here.
Ducked in the alley for a quick bowl.

21:58.572 --> 22:00.472
You know,
take the edge off.

22:00.574 --> 22:02.474
Dude grabs me from behind,
puts a knife to me...

22:02.576 --> 22:04.806
- tell me to dime po-po and give y'all an address.
- What is it?

22:04.912 --> 22:06.812
Sister need to be
about her paper.

22:06.914 --> 22:09.610
That blade on this pretty face
scared my ass to death.

22:09.717 --> 22:11.912
Here.

22:12.019 --> 22:14.544
- 2711 Heliotrope.
- What am / gonna find there?

22:14.655 --> 22:16.555
- Didn't say.
- What's the guy look like?

22:16.657 --> 22:19.421
Told me if / turn around,
he's gonna cut out my implants.

22:19.527 --> 22:21.722
- Did he sound black or white?
- Honey, / wasn't trying to know.

22:21.829 --> 22:24.093
I just finished paying
for my new kitty cats.

22:24.198 --> 22:27.759
Another dub buy you
some bomb-ass skully.

22:27.868 --> 22:31.497
You know I'm gonna take care of your piece
better than any other female.

22:31.605 --> 22:34.073
I'm gonna have to take
your word for it.

22:46.954 --> 22:48.683
Go.

23:02.403 --> 23:06.339
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus!

23:08.475 --> 23:11.308
[Flies Buzzing]

23:14.248 --> 23:16.148
[Man Groans]

23:18.953 --> 23:21.751
Everyone outside
until the detectives get here.

23:22.890 --> 23:25.256
[Officers Murmuring]

23:41.408 --> 23:43.569
Stay behind the line.

23:43.677 --> 23:46.703
[Man] Officer, can you just
tell us the names-

24:25.019 --> 24:26.919
They were killed somewhere else
and dumped here.

24:27.021 --> 24:30.855
Yeah. Forensics'job just got harder by half.
Gotta find the murder scene.

24:30.958 --> 24:34.758
- We seized this house last month.
- Somebody's certainly making his point.

24:34.862 --> 24:37.228
Antwon Mitchell's
hit the hardest.

24:37.331 --> 24:40.095
He partnered
with the Salvadorans in Lompoc.

24:40.200 --> 24:43.499
Likes to use them
for the dirty stuff.

24:43.604 --> 24:47.267
You remember that Salvadoran broker,
Spider, from the church bust?

24:47.374 --> 24:50.104
- I had a chat with him.
- The I.N.S. hasn't sent him
back to El Salvador yet?

24:50.210 --> 24:52.110
They're not the most efficient bunch.

24:52.212 --> 24:54.942
But anyway, he put me onto a guy
who does dirty work for Antwon.

24:55.049 --> 24:58.314
- Let me know.
- Yeah.

25:05.959 --> 25:07.893
[Whispering]
It's a foursome.

25:07.995 --> 25:09.986
Easy way to wash drug money.

25:10.097 --> 25:12.691
The bottles come in the front,
the big faces come out the back.

25:12.800 --> 25:14.700
- Go around.
- Yeah.

25:14.802 --> 25:17.066
[Men Chattering,
/ndistinct]

25:19.940 --> 25:23.501
Freeze! Hands on the table!
Don't move!

25:23.610 --> 25:27.046
[Mackey]
Which one of you is Pitarrio?

25:29.316 --> 25:31.341
Pitarrio!

25:33.153 --> 25:35.053
Pitarrio.

25:43.130 --> 25:45.064
- [Groans]
- Pitarrio!

25:45.165 --> 25:47.156
Talk!

25:48.769 --> 25:51.829
- Cabrón.
- Get out. Get out.

25:59.046 --> 26:02.709
- Who paid you to kill the cops?
- I didn't kill no cops.

26:02.816 --> 26:05.512
- [Groans]
- Antwon Mitchell gave you the order.

26:05.619 --> 26:08.747
- No, I didn't do no cops, man. [Groans]
- Spider says you did.

26:08.856 --> 26:12.622
[Panting, Groaning]
/ was at the movies last night.

26:13.894 --> 26:16.192
Ticket's in my jacket.

26:20.834 --> 26:22.995
Sylmar.
8:30 show last night.

26:23.103 --> 26:25.003
Shit.

26:27.841 --> 26:30.036
- No.
- [Groans]

26:30.144 --> 26:32.840
You didn't kill the cops,
but you did something for Mitchell.

26:32.946 --> 26:35.574
What was it?

26:35.682 --> 26:38.082
- What?
- The body.

26:38.185 --> 26:41.120
- Antwon told me to move a body.
- Cops?

26:41.221 --> 26:44.918
- No. I think it was a girl.
- Where?

26:45.025 --> 26:48.017
- Where?
- [Groans] Griffith Park, man.

26:48.128 --> 26:50.756
By the horses.

26:57.037 --> 26:59.437
Need to interview the suspect
Billings brought in.

26:59.540 --> 27:01.440
Psst.

27:01.542 --> 27:03.442
Psst. Psst.

27:06.647 --> 27:09.878
Surveillance has been
nonproductive thus far.

27:11.652 --> 27:14.553
/ have been monitoring
the chatter and so forth.

27:14.655 --> 27:17.215
Sorry to hear
about those two officers.

27:18.992 --> 27:22.689
They deserved better than
getting dragged down like that.

27:24.531 --> 27:27.523
Why don't you start
without me?

27:27.634 --> 27:30.797
What do you mean,
"dragged down"?

27:30.904 --> 27:33.464
Hey, I need you
to really concentrate...

27:33.574 --> 27:35.667
on everything you saw
last night.

27:35.776 --> 27:38.643
See it in your mind
like it's a movie...

27:38.745 --> 27:40.645
and you're looking at it
one frame at a time.

27:40.747 --> 27:42.647
- Can you do that for me?
- I'll try.

27:42.749 --> 27:46.549
I've got one of those brains
that skips around a lot.

27:47.855 --> 27:50.551
Uh, and my condolences
to the Marco Polo family.

27:50.657 --> 27:54.093
[Laughs]
In a cavern

27:54.194 --> 27:56.287
In a canyon

27:56.396 --> 27:58.523
Excavating

27:58.632 --> 28:00.532
For a mine

28:00.634 --> 28:05.003
Dwells a miner, forty-niner
and his daughter

28:05.105 --> 28:07.198
Clementine

28:11.278 --> 28:15.408
- /'m in a hurry, so / won't waste your time.
- I'll do the same.

28:15.516 --> 28:19.043
People say not a lot happens on your block
if you don't sign off on it.

28:19.152 --> 28:22.212
I look after my peoples.

28:22.322 --> 28:25.883
We had two cops murdered and dumped
in a house on your street.

28:25.993 --> 28:28.553
- That had to have been outsiders.
- Really?

28:28.662 --> 28:30.562
You and your neighbors
weren't pissed off...

28:30.664 --> 28:33.360
- the police seized that house on your street?
- Wasn't my house.

28:33.467 --> 28:36.163
Owners cooked meth.

28:36.270 --> 28:38.568
Street's been safer
since you done it.

28:40.240 --> 28:43.107
[Officer]
Just keep it back.

28:45.012 --> 28:48.038
We need to do another canvass
of this whole area.

28:48.148 --> 28:50.582
Figure out how
Carl and Scooby disappeared.

28:50.684 --> 28:52.914
- What are we looking for?
- I'm not sure.

28:53.020 --> 28:56.148
But it may involve a geological anomaly
in the Earth's crust.

28:58.592 --> 29:01.584
Just something to keep in mind
as you do your search.

29:14.942 --> 29:18.036
Vonda,
/'m Captain Monica Rawling.

29:19.246 --> 29:21.146
He's dead.

29:22.983 --> 29:24.883
/'m so sorry.

29:26.320 --> 29:28.481
He believed
in what you're doing.

29:30.090 --> 29:35.528
- He was proud to put on his uniform every day.
- He was-

29:35.629 --> 29:38.462
But what you're doing here in Farmington
is what got him killed.

29:38.565 --> 29:41.557
You need to know that.

29:41.668 --> 29:44.228
Carl was a hero.

29:44.338 --> 29:46.636
You need to know that.

29:47.674 --> 29:49.574
I need you
to leave now.

29:49.676 --> 29:51.576
Both of you.

29:54.548 --> 29:57.642
Please, just-Just go.

30:30.450 --> 30:33.544
Hey, uh, give me
a hand with this.

30:34.888 --> 30:36.788
Here.

30:38.859 --> 30:42.090
Yeah, Southwest. That's cool. We'll pick
him up. Thanks, man. We owe you one.

30:42.195 --> 30:44.095
Was that about Antwon?

30:46.900 --> 30:50.131
- Well?
- Yeah. That was, uh, Walon Burke, Decoy-

30:50.237 --> 30:52.137
I know Walon.
What did he give you?

30:52.239 --> 30:55.106
An F.B./. pal ofhis in Westwood
just got a hit on Antwon's credit card.

30:55.208 --> 30:57.301
He charged a plane ticket from Vegas.

30:57.411 --> 30:59.811
Due into L.A.X. at 7:30.

30:59.913 --> 31:03.872
- Southwest.
- /'ll send some unis to pick him up.

31:03.984 --> 31:06.578
- Nice work.
- [Dutch] / got something.

31:06.687 --> 31:09.417
Found it at the bottom of a manhole
near our original crime scene.

31:09.523 --> 31:11.923
There's blood everywhere
down there.

31:12.025 --> 31:14.016
How do you get two cops
in the sewer?

31:14.127 --> 31:16.254
"Officer, my daughter just fell down there.
Can you help me?"

31:16.363 --> 31:19.855
Blinged out dog tag the hip-hop kids wear.
Initials "J.P."

31:19.966 --> 31:23.231
Found it in the blood. It's too
untarnished to have been down there long.

31:23.336 --> 31:26.567
Get the owner, got a killer.

31:28.709 --> 31:30.438
So how many guys
you think it took...

31:30.544 --> 31:32.774
- you know, to get Carl and Scooby down there?
- A few.

31:32.879 --> 31:35.109
There's a lot of anger
about what's going on.

31:35.215 --> 31:37.843
Yeah, well, they're angry
because it's working.

31:37.951 --> 31:39.851
A lot of us
are behind the captain.

31:39.953 --> 31:40.851
That's understandable.

31:40.954 --> 31:44.583
Sometimes street level isn't
the best vantage point to really see-

31:44.691 --> 31:46.591
[Sharp Sounds]

31:46.693 --> 31:48.490
- [Brakes Screeching]
- What the hell was that?

31:56.670 --> 31:58.433
Holy shit.

32:09.349 --> 32:12.614
This look familiar
to you, Yancy?

32:12.719 --> 32:15.415
- Don't think so.
- It was ripped from the neck...

32:15.522 --> 32:18.013
of one of the people
who killed two cops last night...

32:18.125 --> 32:20.025
whose bodies were found
on your block.

32:20.127 --> 32:22.595
- You're hip-deep in this shit.
- You're the mayor on that block.

32:22.696 --> 32:26.962
- You either did it, or you know about it.
- Don't come near me with that.

32:27.067 --> 32:29.331
So you're saying you've
never seen this jewelry before.

32:29.436 --> 32:32.428
Name's Yancy Backus.
Remember?

32:32.539 --> 32:34.439
"J.P." belongs
to somebody else.

32:34.541 --> 32:36.668
So it belongs to one of your friends
you did the killing with.

32:36.777 --> 32:38.870
Y'all took my cell phone
downstairs.

32:38.979 --> 32:40.879
Check my friends and family.

32:42.616 --> 32:44.948
Or you could check
with LeimertJewelers-

32:45.051 --> 32:47.451
The people who made this.

32:47.554 --> 32:49.818
See who
they sold it to.

32:53.326 --> 32:55.920
[Whispering]
Stupid-ass-

32:56.062 --> 32:59.793
- [People Clamoring]
- [Man] We didn't do nothing.

32:59.900 --> 33:01.959
[Siren Wailing]

33:02.068 --> 33:04.969
[Man]
What's wrong with you?

33:08.708 --> 33:10.835
- [Officer] Who wrote this?
- Man, he ain't seen nothing.

33:10.944 --> 33:12.605
He was out back,
loading the truck.

33:12.712 --> 33:14.270
- That's bullshit.
- What's bullshit-

33:14.381 --> 33:17.316
Brothers out here dying,
none of you turning over the street.

33:17.417 --> 33:19.408
- One of these cops was a brother.
- A cop ain't a brother.

33:19.519 --> 33:22.511
- Maybe you saw something then, huh?
- Man, get the fuck-

33:25.792 --> 33:28.283
- Hey, come here. Get your ass over here.
- [Groaning]

33:35.402 --> 33:37.495
[Clamoring Continues]

33:37.604 --> 33:39.629
You okay?

33:44.678 --> 33:46.646
You know, you might
want to get that x-rayed.

33:46.746 --> 33:49.613
I got the wind
knocked out of me is all.

33:49.716 --> 33:52.116
Comes with the territory.

33:52.219 --> 33:56.053
- Along with getting shot at.
- Don't single yourself out.

33:56.156 --> 33:59.853
- Three other officers
got their cars fired on today.
- Everybody okay?

33:59.960 --> 34:03.054
Thank God.

34:03.163 --> 34:06.599
Not that you're asking,
but I've lost cops under my command.

34:06.700 --> 34:10.693
/t's easy to shit your pants,
but it accomplishes nothing.

34:10.804 --> 34:14.534
- I wasn't going down that road.
- What /'m saying is...

34:14.641 --> 34:18.577
a thing like this- especially if there's
no good news right away-

34:18.678 --> 34:21.043
can paralyze you.

34:21.147 --> 34:24.344
Those people out there
need to feel your confidence.

34:32.359 --> 34:35.623
Vic. You're empty-handed.

34:35.728 --> 34:37.754
Where's the guy who does
all of Antwon's dirty work?

34:37.864 --> 34:40.331
He had an airtight alibi.

34:40.433 --> 34:44.062
Well, it's going around. Antwon just
happened to be in Vegas last night.

34:44.170 --> 34:46.764
Got his flight info. / have some unis
posted at L.A. X...

34:46.873 --> 34:48.773
to grab him when he gets
off the plane.

34:48.875 --> 34:52.174
- Some good news, finally.
- Yeah, well, conversations with Mitchell...

34:52.279 --> 34:54.179
tend to go around
in circles.

34:54.281 --> 34:56.909
I don't want to keep the community
waiting while I find...

34:57.016 --> 34:59.781
a straight line.

34:59.886 --> 35:02.218
Dutch and Claudette
have come up empty too.

35:04.157 --> 35:06.057
Maybe it's time to, uh...

35:06.159 --> 35:08.457
bring in a person
of interest.

35:10.163 --> 35:12.563
- Lay it off on someone?
- Just a couple of days.

35:12.666 --> 35:15.430
Give us a chance to try to squeeze
the truth out of Antwon.

35:15.535 --> 35:18.333
Makes people think twice
before they take a shot at a uni.

35:18.438 --> 35:21.839
- You have anyone in mind?
- No.

35:21.942 --> 35:23.842
Just as long
as he fills the bill.

35:23.944 --> 35:27.539
One unsympathetic asshole
coming right up.

35:33.119 --> 35:36.179
Captain's arranged a welcome wagon for
Antwon. He's flying into L.A.X. tonight.

35:36.289 --> 35:38.757
So I hear.
You knew?

35:38.858 --> 35:43.056
What part of us getting information first
didn't you understand?

35:43.163 --> 35:45.927
Captain was standing right there
when I got the call. I had to tell her.

35:46.032 --> 35:47.932
- She doesn't have anything on Antwon.
- No.

35:48.034 --> 35:50.002
But he's got plenty
on them.

35:50.103 --> 35:51.934
If we haul in Antwon,
push the wrong buttons...

35:52.038 --> 35:54.336
how long you think it's gonna take him
to point a finger at me and Army?

35:54.441 --> 35:56.636
I'll make sure it takes long enough
for us to get our leverage back.

35:56.743 --> 35:59.439
Look, we gotta find a goat
to pin these murders on-

35:59.546 --> 36:03.038
- calm the streets before another cop gets killed.
- This captain won't go for that.

36:03.149 --> 36:05.617
It was her idea.
All we need is a face and a name.

36:05.719 --> 36:08.210
Anyone in Antwon's circle
fit that bill?

36:08.321 --> 36:12.223
Well, there is this young cat. Earned his cred
by supplying clean guns to the black sets.

36:12.325 --> 36:14.225
Whatever he was doing
last night, it wasn't legal.

36:14.327 --> 36:17.194
- Guppy got a name?
- Street name's Urkel.

36:17.297 --> 36:19.265
- [Man Snickers]
- Swear to God.

36:19.366 --> 36:21.266
[Laughs]
All right, good.

36:21.368 --> 36:23.302
You and Ronnie go pick up
our cop killer.

36:23.403 --> 36:27.396
- Now you want us to haul in an innocent guy?
- He'll have a car full of guns.

36:27.507 --> 36:30.635
Bring him in for that.
We'll figure the rest out later.

36:31.811 --> 36:33.711
Let's go.

36:46.426 --> 36:49.554
- Rise and shine, big pimpin'.
- [Gasps]

36:49.662 --> 36:51.425
Get ahold of our thick friend.
Give him a heads-up.

36:51.531 --> 36:54.762
- About what?
- Our captain likes him for killing those cops.

36:54.868 --> 36:57.098
She's sending a blue crew
to L.A.X. to pick him up.

36:57.203 --> 36:59.694
He needs to fly into Burbank instead.
We'll surprise him there.

36:59.806 --> 37:01.706
Tell him how to play this out
with our bosses.

37:01.808 --> 37:03.708
What makes you think he's
gonna drop his black ass...

37:03.810 --> 37:07.974
- into whatever jackpot you got planned?
- No more games, no more threats.

37:08.081 --> 37:11.278
We want to stop beef and start
doing business the right way.

37:11.384 --> 37:14.842
This guy wants you dead.
He ain't getting into a car with y'all.

37:14.954 --> 37:17.388
He's not gonna have a choice.
Now make the damn call.

37:17.490 --> 37:19.390
[Line Ringing]

37:23.363 --> 37:25.263
- Hell yeah, that's my shit.
- So you're admitting...

37:25.365 --> 37:29.267
- you were present at a crime scene
last night, Jamal?
- Crime scene?

37:29.369 --> 37:31.599
- Those two dead cops.
- [Dutch] Friends of ours, actually.

37:31.704 --> 37:33.604
- No, I was not there.
- But your necklace was?

37:33.706 --> 37:35.674
- How do you explain that?
- Necklace got itself stolen.

37:35.775 --> 37:37.675
[Laughing]
Right.

37:37.777 --> 37:40.245
- When?
- Six, seven months ago.

37:40.346 --> 37:42.746
- They took the TV too.
- You, uh, report it?

37:42.849 --> 37:45.750
I spent three G's getting
this thing custom made.

37:45.852 --> 37:47.752
You best believe your ass
I reported it.

37:47.854 --> 37:51.984
- Go check your records.
- Police have any idea who took it?

37:52.092 --> 37:54.652
I kept trying to check back
with you cops every couple weeks...

37:54.761 --> 37:56.661
see if they heard
anything new.

37:56.763 --> 37:58.663
No one seemed real interested.

38:01.468 --> 38:04.130
Y'all real interested
now though, huh?

38:19.819 --> 38:23.311
Dutch.
Need you to come up, please.

38:29.362 --> 38:31.421
So the trail just stops?

38:31.531 --> 38:33.829
Well, even with the necklace stolen,
we're thinking...

38:33.933 --> 38:36.197
it probably ended up in the hands
of somebody with the initials "J.P."

38:36.302 --> 38:39.999
[Monica]
That's reaching. What else do we have?

38:40.106 --> 38:42.006
No witnesses,
but we're waiting for lab work.

38:42.108 --> 38:45.544
So that's the plan? We just get lucky,
something falls in our laps?

38:45.645 --> 38:49.137
- /t's only the first day.
- Every day will just get harder.

38:49.249 --> 38:52.741
Meanwhile, I've had
four different squad cars shot at...

38:52.852 --> 38:55.150
two brawls with civilians
and officers...

38:55.255 --> 38:57.246
and one instance in which
my own men lost control.

38:57.357 --> 38:59.587
It's got to stop.

39:03.630 --> 39:06.224
Vic and his guys have
brought in a suspect.

39:06.332 --> 39:08.596
Great!
What do we have on him?

39:08.701 --> 39:10.862
Carload of stolen guns.

39:10.970 --> 39:13.666
Our guys were stabbed.

39:13.773 --> 39:19.006
He's a gang member.
We've got him on weapons charges.

39:19.112 --> 39:22.081
- But nothing related to our murders?
- / want you to make the press...

39:22.182 --> 39:25.879
- believe that we have a killer in custody.
- [Dutch] Oh, you're kidding.

39:25.985 --> 39:28.613
- You want us to lie?
- Save your high and mighties for a time...

39:28.721 --> 39:30.348
when the lives of my cops
aren't at stake.

39:30.456 --> 39:33.016
- You've had a chance to solve this.
- It's only been one day.

39:33.126 --> 39:35.959
And you've been doing your best,
but we're not far enough.

39:36.062 --> 39:39.327
We tell the community that we
have a killer, it sends the message...

39:39.432 --> 39:41.730
that there's a price to pay
for coming after us.

39:41.834 --> 39:44.234
Makes whoever
really did it cocky...

39:44.337 --> 39:47.067
gets them laughing with their friends
about what idiots we are...

39:47.173 --> 39:49.073
and if they tell
their friends-

39:49.175 --> 39:52.838
- Their friends tell someone who tells us.
- You wanted the case...

39:52.946 --> 39:55.141
so take the bad
with the good.

40:11.798 --> 40:14.358
[Antwon]
So 5-0 was waiting for me at L.A.X.?

40:14.467 --> 40:16.833
How is this an improvement?

40:16.936 --> 40:20.167
My little gift to you,
running interference.

40:20.273 --> 40:22.901
I didn't know
I made your Christmas list.

40:23.009 --> 40:25.500
We want a truce.

40:25.612 --> 40:30.640
You know, there's a much bigger upside
for you, me being alive and kicking.

40:30.750 --> 40:31.648
[Antwon]
/ don't see it.

40:31.751 --> 40:35.778
Truth is, my captain's made
a serious dent in your business.

40:35.888 --> 40:39.949
How long before someone in your
organization decides to play King of the Hill?

40:40.059 --> 40:42.357
Nobody's taking me down.

40:42.462 --> 40:45.659
- Not without my backing.
- You been stepping on my game since day one.

40:45.765 --> 40:48.734
That earns you dead.

40:49.802 --> 40:52.293
Yeah? That didn't happen.

41:12.358 --> 41:14.258
[Scoffs]

41:14.360 --> 41:16.988
My boys saw you gaffing me
up at the airport, so-

41:17.096 --> 41:19.462
Now what?

41:21.701 --> 41:25.432
You back off of me and mine,
Shane and his family.

41:25.538 --> 41:27.438
We work out fair percentages.

41:27.540 --> 41:30.839
You get to do business uninterrupted.
That's the deal.

41:35.214 --> 41:37.239
Either you smoking crack
or you think I am.

41:37.350 --> 41:39.318
Our captain pulled him off lead
on the gang task force.

41:39.419 --> 41:41.319
He lost his pay bump.

41:41.421 --> 41:43.946
There's no up side for me
to play by their rules anymore.

41:44.057 --> 41:46.958
I got two sick kids.
I gotta earn.

41:47.060 --> 41:51.121
And I ain't got time to hear no more
of this crackerwood bullshit.

41:52.999 --> 41:54.899
I know you been looking
for a new tar importer...

41:55.001 --> 42:00.564
ever since you lost that cul-de-sac,
the El Salvadorans.

42:00.673 --> 42:03.233
[Mackey] / got a hookup with
a Jamaican crew out of Miami.

42:03.343 --> 42:05.743
They call themselves
the Splash Posse.

42:05.845 --> 42:08.245
Yeah, I heard of them niggas.

42:08.348 --> 42:10.748
They're looking to move weight
out of the West Coast.

42:10.850 --> 42:13.410
I'm their broker.

42:13.519 --> 42:16.283
We need a retail outlet.

42:17.690 --> 42:20.352
So you a baller
all of a sudden now.

42:20.460 --> 42:23.793
Always was.

42:23.896 --> 42:27.627
/ just took a step back
from the game for a little while.

42:30.370 --> 42:33.533
So what's your captain
gonna sweat me on, huh?

42:33.639 --> 42:36.665
These dead cops?

42:36.776 --> 42:40.109
I don't kill for no reason...

42:40.213 --> 42:42.875
and I don't know nothin'
about merkin' no police.

42:42.982 --> 42:45.780
[Shane]
They got nothin'on you.

42:45.885 --> 42:47.785
They'll hold you
for a few hours...

42:47.887 --> 42:51.414
- and then cut you loose.
- [Mackey] /'ll be in the room.

42:51.524 --> 42:54.618
I'll steer the questioning away
from anything sensitive.

42:54.727 --> 42:59.027
That is...
if we're working together.

43:03.503 --> 43:07.234
You're lucky your boy
got mad love for you.

43:07.340 --> 43:10.104
Oh, yeah.

43:10.209 --> 43:13.178
We're all about mad love.

43:14.714 --> 43:16.579
The suspect's name
is Donzell Prince.

43:16.682 --> 43:19.344
[Man] You've arrested him for the
murders of Officers Haimes and Miller?

43:19.452 --> 43:21.352
Currently, he's only being
held on weapons charges...

43:21.454 --> 43:23.354
but we're confident
we have our man.

43:23.456 --> 43:25.424
[Man] /f you're so confident,
why don't you file on murder?

43:25.525 --> 43:27.823
We don't want to make any mistakes.
No one wants to take chances.

43:27.927 --> 43:30.487
[Man]
Do you believe he acted alone?

43:30.596 --> 43:33.121
Doesn't the crime itself suggest
that there were multiple assailants?

43:33.232 --> 43:37.396
I really can't go into our theory
of the crime at this time.

43:37.503 --> 43:39.698
Has the suspect indicated
any accomplices?

43:39.806 --> 43:42.274
I can't talk about the specifics
of what the suspect revealed.

43:42.375 --> 43:44.775
All / can say is,
our investigation is bearing fruit...

43:44.877 --> 43:47.107
and we'll have more for you
in the coming days.

43:47.213 --> 43:49.943
- Thank you.
- [Reporters Shouting Questions]

43:57.390 --> 44:00.188
- Danny. Bring him up to one?
- [Danny] Sure.

44:00.293 --> 44:03.262
- We frisked him. He's clean.
- [Danny] All right.

44:05.164 --> 44:08.565
He gave us the slip at L.A.X.
How did you find him?

44:08.668 --> 44:10.636
One of his crew told us
he got a heads-up.

44:10.736 --> 44:13.432
Figured he only had one
of two choices left, Burbank or L.B.

44:13.539 --> 44:16.007
- We got him at Bob Hope.
- Nice.

44:16.108 --> 44:18.008
Don't know what
we're gonna throw at him yet.

44:18.110 --> 44:20.772
I've got a couple aces
up my sleeve.

44:22.682 --> 44:26.277
- See you up there.
- [Mackey] Yeah.

44:26.385 --> 44:28.285
Help yourself.

44:29.822 --> 44:32.052
All known city gang members
with the initials...

44:32.158 --> 44:34.058
"J" and "P."

44:34.160 --> 44:36.060
Hope you got a four-leaf clover
in your pocket.

44:36.162 --> 44:38.426
- We should start with One-niners.
- In Farmington.

44:38.531 --> 44:41.261
- You want some dinner?
- I had dinner- four hours ago.

44:41.367 --> 44:43.927
Yeah. I mean another dinner.

44:44.036 --> 44:46.504
Whatever you want's
fine with me.

44:46.606 --> 44:48.574
We have nothing
to charge Antwon with.

44:48.674 --> 44:51.404
Means we can only hold him
for 12 hours.

44:51.511 --> 44:55.242
She's buried in Griffith Park, somewhere
near the horses, in three holes.

44:55.348 --> 44:57.646
- Christ.
- [Mackey] All right, /'ll tie up Mitchell.

44:57.750 --> 44:59.945
Make sure he doesn't
dime anyone to move her again.

45:00.052 --> 45:02.520
You three have to find
the graves.

45:02.622 --> 45:05.090
[Curtis]
/'ll do it too.

45:07.793 --> 45:09.761
Look for fresh digging.
Let's find her.

45:19.805 --> 45:21.705
Don't need that.

45:37.523 --> 45:40.117
Thanks for coming in, Antwon.

45:52.271 --> 45:54.136
[Rock]

45:54.240 --> 45:56.640
[Men, Women Chattering]

45:58.244 --> 46:02.146
[Continues]

46:19.265 --> 46:20.299
[Men, Women Chattering]

46:20.299 --> 46:22.665

46:22.768 --> 46:25.202
