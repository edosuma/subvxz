00:05.372 --> 00:09.006
Male sergeant: Shooters,
one minute of slow fire
time remaining.

00:09.008 --> 00:11.541
Recruit number 11,
you're in the berm.

00:11.543 --> 00:13.142
Settle your ass down.

00:13.144 --> 00:15.277
Female sergeant: Ease up
on the fore-end, recruit.

00:15.279 --> 00:17.012
You're not waxing
your surfboard.

00:17.748 --> 00:19.013
All right, perfect.

00:19.015 --> 00:20.114
Just like that.

00:26.588 --> 00:28.621
Cease fire, cease fire.

00:28.623 --> 00:31.023
Unload, clear and lock.

00:31.025 --> 00:32.791
Make a complete safe weapon.

00:32.793 --> 00:34.793
Clear on left?

00:34.795 --> 00:36.127
Coach:
Clear.

00:36.129 --> 00:37.228
Clear on right?

00:37.230 --> 00:38.329
Clear!

00:38.331 --> 00:39.496
The line is clear.

00:39.498 --> 00:41.064
Shooters, remain in place.

00:41.066 --> 00:42.765
Load one magazine
with ten rounds.

00:42.767 --> 00:45.067
Do not load your rifle.

00:45.069 --> 00:46.601
Coach:
Do not move!

00:46.603 --> 00:48.369
Coaches, stay vigilant.

00:48.371 --> 00:49.436
Yes, sir!

00:49.438 --> 00:50.570
Coach 2:
Sir, yes, sir.

00:50.572 --> 00:52.638
(sighs, groans quietly)

00:55.175 --> 00:58.209
With all due respect, gunny,
you look like crap.

00:58.211 --> 01:00.110
(sighs)
must be 100 degrees out here.

01:00.112 --> 01:02.345
Let's get you a fan.
Some ice...

01:03.214 --> 01:05.147
Gunny.

01:05.149 --> 01:06.781
Gunny.

01:06.783 --> 01:09.049
Man down! Man down!

01:09.051 --> 01:10.083
Corpsman up!
I've got the corpsman!

01:10.084 --> 01:11.116
Soldier: Oh, he's down.
Just went down.

01:11.119 --> 01:12.118
Soldier 2:
Move!

01:12.120 --> 01:13.752
Shooters, remain in place.

01:13.754 --> 01:15.086
Get your eyes on range.

01:16.155 --> 01:18.054
¶ ¶

01:25.530 --> 01:27.530
¶ ¶

01:46.183 --> 01:48.449
(deeks whistles)

01:48.451 --> 01:51.084
That's sam hanna
laser-focused on...

01:51.086 --> 01:53.186
What is that, centipede?

01:53.188 --> 01:54.120
Old-school, I love it.

01:54.122 --> 01:55.521
(chuckles)

01:55.523 --> 01:57.222
It's a strand of dna.

01:57.224 --> 01:58.457
Of course it is.

01:58.458 --> 01:59.691
I'm helping my daughter
with her homework.

01:59.693 --> 02:01.559
I'm looking
for a palindromic sequence

02:01.561 --> 02:03.127
Where the enzymes cleave.

02:03.129 --> 02:04.294
Wow. You had me at palindromic.

02:04.296 --> 02:05.395
It's where the base pairs

02:05.397 --> 02:07.230
Are identical forward
and backwards.

02:07.232 --> 02:09.298
Much like a word palindrome--

02:09.300 --> 02:12.601
Kayak-- reads the same
in both directions.

02:12.603 --> 02:14.669
Madam, I'm adam.

02:14.671 --> 02:15.870
Naomi, did I moan?

02:15.872 --> 02:18.239
Sex at noon taxes.

02:18.241 --> 02:19.306
All right, enough.

02:20.242 --> 02:21.774
Ah, callen.

02:21.776 --> 02:23.208
You know about palindromes.

02:23.210 --> 02:24.443
Yeah, yeah, no I heard the faa

02:24.444 --> 02:25.677
Is thinking about banning
their use by civilians.

02:27.113 --> 02:28.178
(eric whistles)

02:28.180 --> 02:30.346
Are we not drawn onward?

02:30.348 --> 02:33.882
We few drawn onward
to new era.

02:33.884 --> 02:35.116
That actually works.

02:35.118 --> 02:36.183
Amazing, eric. Well done.

02:36.185 --> 02:37.651
Thanks.

02:37.653 --> 02:41.121
I was, uh, president of the
palindrome club in high school.

02:41.123 --> 02:42.689
Why am I not surprised?

02:43.792 --> 02:46.259
Mr. Owl ate my metal worm.

02:46.261 --> 02:47.793
Eric:
Ooh, good one, deeks.

02:47.795 --> 02:50.162
Words are the money of fools.

02:50.164 --> 02:51.563
Egad, an adage.

02:51.565 --> 02:52.797
That's also a palindrome.

02:52.799 --> 02:54.198
Wow.

02:54.200 --> 02:55.516
That's the best you got?

02:55.517 --> 02:56.833
Nell: This is gunnery sergeant
hugh patterson.

02:56.835 --> 02:59.268
He collapsed and vomited blood
at the pendleton range

02:59.270 --> 03:00.636
This morning.

03:00.638 --> 03:02.237
Kensi: We're not usually
called in for stomach ulcers.

03:02.239 --> 03:04.205
(clears throat)
he's in the icu

03:04.207 --> 03:06.207
With acute radiation syndrome.

03:06.209 --> 03:08.275
Was he exposed or contaminated?

03:08.277 --> 03:09.509
Well, either one can kill you.

03:09.511 --> 03:11.277
Contaminated means you have

03:11.279 --> 03:13.345
Radioactive material
on your body.

03:13.347 --> 03:15.714
Our guy was exposed to an
external dose of radiation.

03:15.716 --> 03:18.783
Callen:
What was the source?

03:18.785 --> 03:20.384
That is today's
burning question.

03:20.386 --> 03:22.219
Anybody else get
sick on the base?

03:22.221 --> 03:24.221
No one yet,

03:24.222 --> 03:26.222
But there can be
a three-week delay in symptoms.

03:27.492 --> 03:30.392
We need to investigate
all potential sources

03:30.394 --> 03:31.526
At pendleton.

03:31.528 --> 03:33.294
Quick question: Are
we gonna be issued

03:33.296 --> 03:34.361
Geiger counters?

03:34.363 --> 03:35.795
No, mr. Deeks,

03:35.797 --> 03:38.731
But lead-lined boxer shorts
are available.

03:38.733 --> 03:40.232
Granger: If this isn't a
work-related exposure,

03:40.234 --> 03:42.934
We have to consider
terrorist activities.

03:42.936 --> 03:44.835
Let's be certain
we're not dealing

03:44.837 --> 03:47.304
With pirated
radioactive material

03:47.306 --> 03:49.773
Or a dirty bomb in the making.

03:49.775 --> 03:51.207
Callen:
Okay, kensi, deeks,

03:51.209 --> 03:52.709
Why don't you start
at the hospital?

03:52.710 --> 03:54.210
We'll check out patterson's men
at the base.

03:54.212 --> 03:56.645
Is she being serious
about the lead-lined boxers?

03:56.647 --> 03:59.180
'cause I got my lineage
to think about, you know?

03:59.182 --> 04:01.248
It could be the end
of the deeks family tree.

04:01.250 --> 04:03.283
Could be doing the world
a big favor.

04:03.285 --> 04:04.417
(clears throat)

04:04.419 --> 04:06.485
Are you comfortable?

04:13.359 --> 04:14.825
He's still in a coma.

04:14.827 --> 04:16.193
A few weeks ago,

04:16.195 --> 04:17.527
Radiation destroyed
his bone marrow.

04:17.529 --> 04:19.695
Now he can't make new platelets,
so he bled out.

04:19.697 --> 04:22.631
With no white blood cells,
he can't fight off infection.

04:22.633 --> 04:24.199
So what's the prognosis?

04:24.201 --> 04:26.334
If we find a match donor,

04:26.336 --> 04:27.968
He will get
a stem cell transplant.

04:27.970 --> 04:29.869
65% chance of survival.

04:29.871 --> 04:31.270
And without the stem cells?

04:31.839 --> 04:32.871
Will you sanitize, please?

04:32.873 --> 04:34.706
Yeah.

04:34.708 --> 04:35.707
(monitor beeping steadily)

04:35.709 --> 04:37.208
Deeks:
Is that the wife?

04:37.210 --> 04:38.676
Doctor:
Yes, and she's

04:38.678 --> 04:40.778
Eight months pregnant.

04:42.481 --> 04:44.347
Jamie?

04:44.349 --> 04:46.414
These are the ncis agents.

04:48.584 --> 04:49.783
Deeks: Hi.

04:49.785 --> 04:52.218
I'm, uh, I'm marty deeks.

04:52.220 --> 04:53.819
Hello.
Kensi blye.

04:53.821 --> 04:56.221
I'm so sorry to be meeting you
under these circumstances.

04:56.223 --> 04:58.356
Do we know how it happened?

04:58.358 --> 05:01.392
Well, we have all of our
resources on the case.

05:01.394 --> 05:04.928
Is there any way he could've
brought the radioactivity home?

05:04.930 --> 05:08.331
Well, as we understand,
he wasn't actually contaminated.

05:08.333 --> 05:10.700
Days ago, maybe he was.

05:10.702 --> 05:12.802
If he didn't shower or change
his clothes right away,

05:12.804 --> 05:14.336
He could've been near me,

05:14.338 --> 05:15.937
And then our baby
would've been...

05:15.939 --> 05:18.406
Your blood count doesn't
indicate significant exposure.

05:18.408 --> 05:20.574
Are any of your friends
or family

05:20.576 --> 05:22.576
Undergoing cancer treatment
at the moment?

05:22.578 --> 05:24.578
Deeks:
Does he have

05:24.580 --> 05:26.246
Any regular after work hangouts?

05:26.248 --> 05:27.947
He came right home.

05:27.949 --> 05:30.349
We're getting
the nursery together.

05:30.351 --> 05:32.884
Kensi: And is the base the
only place that he works?

05:32.886 --> 05:34.569
No.

05:34.570 --> 05:36.253
He started moonlighting
as a security guard,

05:36.256 --> 05:37.355
Like, once a week.

05:37.357 --> 05:39.023
And where is that?

05:39.025 --> 05:41.425
A construction site in carlsbad,

05:41.427 --> 05:42.726
To help make ends meet.

05:42.728 --> 05:44.027
Lots of bills
with a new baby

05:44.029 --> 05:46.329
On the way.

05:48.032 --> 05:49.665
Deeks: Right.

05:49.666 --> 05:51.299
(indistinct announcement
over p.A.)

05:51.300 --> 05:52.933
Captain: Our radiation safety
officers have swept the base.

05:52.936 --> 05:55.403
Everything's clean,
and everything's accounted for

05:55.405 --> 05:58.706
In the hospital's
nuclear medicine department.

05:58.708 --> 06:00.274
Sam:
Anyone else with symptoms?

06:00.276 --> 06:01.675
Captain:
No, no, I'm confident

06:01.677 --> 06:03.410
The exposure
did not take place on base.

06:03.412 --> 06:05.612
How well do you know
gunnery sergeant patterson?

06:05.614 --> 06:08.414
I've been his oic
for three years.

06:08.416 --> 06:10.983
Any conflicts
with subordinates, superiors?

06:10.985 --> 06:12.852
No, he's a peacekeeper.

06:12.853 --> 06:14.720
No, he's the guy you call
when there is a problem.

06:14.722 --> 06:16.421
So no loyalty issues?

06:16.423 --> 06:18.055
No, flawless record.

06:18.057 --> 06:19.723
Commendation medal.

06:19.725 --> 06:21.424
(phone rings)
I can't think of another marine

06:21.426 --> 06:23.559
With more integrity, honesty.

06:23.561 --> 06:24.593
Excuse me.

06:24.595 --> 06:26.361
Yeah, eric?

06:26.363 --> 06:28.996
We've been looking
into patterson's lunar activity.

06:28.998 --> 06:31.064
His moonlighting.

06:31.066 --> 06:32.398
Yeah, the construction site.

06:32.400 --> 06:33.298
Kensi and deeks
are checking it out.

06:33.300 --> 06:34.432
Not anymore.

06:34.434 --> 06:35.933
Patterson never worked there.

06:35.935 --> 06:37.567
Never even applied for the job.

06:38.870 --> 06:40.736
So much for honesty.

06:40.738 --> 06:41.937
He lied to his wife.

06:41.939 --> 06:43.939
That could mean
he's having an affair.

06:43.941 --> 06:47.342
That could mean you're
watching too many telenovelas.

06:47.344 --> 06:49.377
How else am I supposed
to learn spanish?

06:49.379 --> 06:51.979
Guys, get me his car
registration from the dmv.

06:51.981 --> 06:53.447
Year, make and model.

06:53.449 --> 06:54.414
We're on it.

06:54.416 --> 06:55.948
Coming right up.

06:55.950 --> 06:57.082
(beeping steadily)
no radiation.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.416
It's all clear.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.751
Let's open it up.

07:00.753 --> 07:02.986
You know, back in the 1950s,

07:02.988 --> 07:05.388
They used to sell
junior scientist kits

07:05.390 --> 07:08.624
With geiger counters
and real radioactive isotopes?

07:08.626 --> 07:10.459
What, you think maybe
he picked on up on ebay?

07:10.461 --> 07:12.627
No.

07:12.629 --> 07:14.395
They also used x-rays

07:14.397 --> 07:16.696
Shooting through the floor to
see if your kid's shoes fit.

07:19.767 --> 07:20.999
The point is,

07:21.001 --> 07:23.368
You never know what'll hurt you.

07:23.370 --> 07:25.636
Well, maybe someday
we'll find out that kale's toxic

07:25.638 --> 07:27.704
And yoga's bad for your spine.

07:27.706 --> 07:29.405
Why do I even bother?

07:29.407 --> 07:30.773
This place is pretty shipshape.

07:32.443 --> 07:33.975
He's a marine.

07:33.977 --> 07:36.344
Roll of quarters
on the center console.

07:36.346 --> 07:38.011
Just the owner's manual in here.

07:40.949 --> 07:43.549
Payroll stub
from bsf protection.

07:43.551 --> 07:45.717
That's a private security firm.

07:45.719 --> 07:49.353
"for service rendered
at santa flora nuclear power."

07:50.489 --> 07:51.588
That place is decommissioned.

07:51.590 --> 07:53.690
They don't
generate power anymore.

07:53.692 --> 07:56.359
Look at the hourly rate.

07:56.361 --> 07:58.527
That's got to be for hazard pay.

08:02.933 --> 08:05.033
Yeah.

08:05.035 --> 08:06.501
Probably why he lied
to his wife.

08:06.503 --> 08:07.768
Didn't want her to worry.

08:07.770 --> 08:09.653
Trust me,

08:09.654 --> 08:11.537
Nothing good comes
from lying to your wife.

08:12.807 --> 08:14.740
Or so I've heard.

08:14.742 --> 08:16.508
Plant manager:
Welcome to santa flora.

08:16.510 --> 08:17.709
Special agent callen.

08:17.711 --> 08:19.577
Special agent sam hanna.

08:19.579 --> 08:20.878
Damon westphal, plant manager.

08:20.880 --> 08:23.513
I want you to put
these dosimetry badges on.

08:23.515 --> 08:25.414
Possibility of
radiation exposure?

08:25.416 --> 08:27.115
Well, you're more likely
to get struck by lightning,

08:27.117 --> 08:29.650
But, uh, we like to play
by the rules.

08:29.652 --> 08:30.917
Is your chief of security
available?

08:30.919 --> 08:32.151
Yeah, he's right here
on your schedule.

08:32.153 --> 08:33.719
You'll be meeting
with all our department heads,

08:33.721 --> 08:35.587
Starting with leo chadmont,
our chief engineer.

08:35.589 --> 08:38.389
Yeah, well, we're gonna need a
little time to walk the grounds.

08:38.391 --> 08:39.623
Absolutely. We can
assign an escort

08:39.625 --> 08:41.691
From public relations
to take you around.

08:44.696 --> 08:48.931
So, it all starts with a ceramic
pellet packed with uranium.

08:48.933 --> 08:51.533
Real one yields about
the same amount of energy

08:51.535 --> 08:53.001
As a ton of coal.
It's impressive.

08:53.003 --> 08:55.670
And clean. Not a single molecule
of co2 two emitted.

08:55.672 --> 08:59.640
320 pellets are loaded
into a 12-foot rod.

08:59.642 --> 09:02.009
264 rods make up
a fuel assembly.

09:02.011 --> 09:04.778
And we have 200 fuel
assemblies inside the reactor.

09:04.780 --> 09:06.546
17 million pellets.

09:06.548 --> 09:07.880
Callen:
He was a mathamagician.

09:07.882 --> 09:09.047
(groans, sighs)

09:09.049 --> 09:10.048
Mathlete.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.550
But your reactor's cold.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.485
Uh, I stand corrected.

09:14.487 --> 09:17.554
Uh, in fact,
we, uh, had 200 fuel assemblies

09:17.556 --> 09:19.556
In the reactor,
but now it's empty.

09:19.558 --> 09:21.524
So where's the radiation risk?

09:21.526 --> 09:22.591
Well, underwater.

09:22.593 --> 09:24.593
The old fuel
assemblies are moved

09:24.595 --> 09:25.927
Through a
underwater tunnel

09:25.929 --> 09:27.895
Into a spent-fuel cooling pool.

09:27.897 --> 09:28.962
For how long?

09:28.964 --> 09:30.663
Takes about ten years

09:30.665 --> 09:32.197
For the intense radioactivity
to decay.

09:32.199 --> 09:34.098
Is there a safety perimeter
around the pool?

09:34.100 --> 09:35.532
It's 20 feet
underwater,

09:35.534 --> 09:37.584
So it's totally protective.

09:37.585 --> 09:39.635
You could swim laps on
the surface and not get exposed.

09:39.638 --> 09:41.537
What if someone pulled a rod
out of the water?

09:41.539 --> 09:43.438
It'd be deadly
in a minute.

09:43.440 --> 09:45.173
(laughing):
But it's also impossible.

09:45.175 --> 09:47.842
I mean, each assembly weighs
almost a thousand pounds.

09:47.844 --> 09:49.810
And with constant
radiation level

09:49.812 --> 09:51.678
And video monitoring,
we'd know.

09:51.680 --> 09:54.180
Then how did
a security guard get exposed?

09:54.182 --> 09:56.849
Maybe he dived down
20 feet underwater

09:56.851 --> 09:59.551
And hugged a fuel rod.

09:59.553 --> 10:01.653
Patterson had a
dosimetry badge.
What does it say?

10:01.655 --> 10:03.488
Well, those get checked
once a month,

10:03.490 --> 10:05.073
But we're running 'em early.

10:05.074 --> 10:06.657
You guys have any more questions
for dr. Chadmont?

10:06.659 --> 10:08.225
Okay, we got about, uh,

10:08.227 --> 10:09.559
Ten minutes till
your next appointment.

10:09.561 --> 10:10.693
Give me a sec,
and we'll grab a coffee.

10:10.695 --> 10:11.760
Okay.
Nice to meet you.

10:11.762 --> 10:13.828
Nice to meet you.
Yeah.

10:17.834 --> 10:18.833
You trust these guys?

10:18.835 --> 10:21.502
About as far as
I can throw 'em.

10:21.504 --> 10:22.970
(indistinct conversation
in distance)

10:22.972 --> 10:25.639
Hard to get things done
on a short leash.

10:25.641 --> 10:27.741
If they're not gonna
let us in the front door,

10:27.743 --> 10:29.909
Maybe we need to sneak
someone in the back.

10:29.911 --> 10:31.677
Okay.
Right this way, gentlemen.

10:31.679 --> 10:32.744
Great.

10:46.926 --> 10:48.825
What if patterson wakes up

10:48.827 --> 10:50.159
And he has some sort of
critical information?

10:50.161 --> 10:52.161
Shouldn't, maybe,
one of us stay here?

10:52.163 --> 10:53.996
Owen is driving south.

10:53.998 --> 10:57.265
He'll take over at the hospital.

10:57.267 --> 10:59.166
Thought callen and sam
had santa flora covered.

10:59.168 --> 11:00.934
Well, unfortunately,

11:00.936 --> 11:04.137
Management has not welcomed them
with open arms.

11:04.139 --> 11:07.273
But fortunately,
they do have an opening

11:07.275 --> 11:09.174
In their
housekeeping department.

11:09.176 --> 11:10.909
Oh, fantastic.

11:10.911 --> 11:12.777
I'm playing a janitor again.
Except for this time,

11:12.779 --> 11:14.979
I'm sweeping up
at a nuclear power plant.

11:14.981 --> 11:18.215
No, no, no, that would be
ms. Blye's assignment.

11:18.217 --> 11:20.617
With pleasure and
without whining.

11:20.619 --> 11:22.785
Patterson's departure

11:22.787 --> 11:25.854
Has left a vacancy
in the security department.

11:25.856 --> 11:28.223
Oh, that's fantastic.
I get that.

11:28.225 --> 11:30.758
Yeah, that was the job that got
patterson the lethal exposure.

11:30.760 --> 11:32.526
Oh... Yeah...

11:32.528 --> 11:34.562
No, maybe I shouldn't be...

11:34.563 --> 11:36.597
Maybe I should be the janitor,
you know what I mean?

11:36.598 --> 11:38.632
'cause I got the skill set and
the look and the experience...

11:38.634 --> 11:40.066
Sorry, mr. Deeks.

11:40.068 --> 11:41.901
No take-backsies.

11:41.903 --> 11:43.903
Good luck with that.
No! Ah!

11:43.905 --> 11:46.138
Speaker:
America's nuclear reactors

11:46.140 --> 11:48.206
Have generated 75,000 tons...
Nice to meet you.

11:49.676 --> 11:52.710
...Of spent nuclear fuel
that will remain toxic...

11:52.712 --> 11:54.345
(whistles)

11:54.346 --> 11:55.979
...And radioactive
for one million years.

11:55.981 --> 11:57.647
Ted oaks,
head of security.

11:57.649 --> 11:59.215
Welcome aboard.
Thank you, sir.

11:59.217 --> 12:01.550
Nut jobs, all of them.

12:01.552 --> 12:02.817
You think?

12:02.819 --> 12:04.552
We're a decommissioned plant.

12:04.554 --> 12:07.788
No reactor,
no possibility of a meltdown.

12:07.790 --> 12:10.323
There's nothing
to worry about.

12:10.325 --> 12:13.192
Some people believe that
toxic, radioactive waste

12:13.194 --> 12:14.860
Is being transported...

12:14.862 --> 12:16.761
Tree-huggers already
won the battle.

12:16.763 --> 12:17.895
They got us shut down,

12:17.897 --> 12:19.696
But they gotta
bellyache about something.

12:19.698 --> 12:21.197
(camera clicking)
what are you doing?

12:21.199 --> 12:22.565
Documenting
the nut jobs, sir,

12:22.567 --> 12:25.134
In case a perpetrator
jumps the fence

12:25.136 --> 12:26.201
Or otherwise trespasses.

12:26.203 --> 12:27.335
I can nail their ass.

12:27.337 --> 12:29.136
I like initiative.

12:29.138 --> 12:30.904
You're a good hire.
Thank you, sir.

12:30.906 --> 12:32.289
By the way,

12:32.290 --> 12:33.673
Perfect timing
on your application.

12:33.675 --> 12:35.274
We had an unexpected opening.

12:35.276 --> 12:36.908
Somebody quit or get fired?

12:36.910 --> 12:38.342
Active duty marine.

12:38.344 --> 12:40.210
Solid guy, but a part-timer.

12:40.212 --> 12:42.579
We needed extra hours,
he couldn't swing 'em.

12:42.581 --> 12:44.047
So is he back at pendleton?

12:44.049 --> 12:45.214
Apparently so.

12:45.216 --> 12:47.149
And speaking of your
application...

12:47.151 --> 12:48.316
A little curious.

12:48.318 --> 12:50.318
You've got lapd experience.

12:50.320 --> 12:51.752
Yes, sir.

12:51.754 --> 12:53.887
That's good.
Why'd you leave?

12:53.889 --> 12:56.022
Too many close calls.

12:56.024 --> 12:57.356
You know.

12:57.358 --> 12:59.891
Thinking about starting
a family, settling down.

12:59.893 --> 13:00.992
That's what a man's gotta do.

13:00.994 --> 13:03.327
Yep.

13:04.997 --> 13:06.829
(door rattles)

13:09.366 --> 13:10.631
(two beeps)

13:18.039 --> 13:20.105
(clears throat)

13:32.251 --> 13:34.217
Cleaning!

13:46.930 --> 13:47.929
(rapid knocking at door)

13:47.931 --> 13:49.514
Deeks:
Would you, uh...

13:49.515 --> 13:51.098
Would you mind if
I came in for a second?

13:51.100 --> 13:52.632
Not until the floor is dry.

13:52.634 --> 13:54.634
Deeks:
Yeah, but it's a little
bit of an emergency.

13:54.636 --> 13:55.701
(door opens)

13:56.670 --> 13:58.069
Oh, wow.

13:58.071 --> 13:59.587
Look at that apron.

13:59.588 --> 14:01.104
You know, some guys are into
the whole french maid thing,

14:01.107 --> 14:02.762
But for me, I've always liked

14:02.763 --> 14:04.418
The working-class girls,
you know what I mean?

14:04.419 --> 14:06.074
Dirt under the fingernails,
haven't showered in a week.

14:06.078 --> 14:07.277
What did you learn
from patterson's boss?

14:07.279 --> 14:08.678
Nothing. He's either
totally in the dark

14:08.680 --> 14:10.413
Or part of the cover-up.
What about you?

14:10.415 --> 14:12.047
Well, I cloned
the corporate e-mail server

14:12.049 --> 14:13.081
And sent it to eric and nell.

14:13.083 --> 14:14.415
They're scanning it as we speak.

14:14.417 --> 14:16.383
Excellent work...
On these sinks.

14:16.385 --> 14:17.384
Does this mean
you're gonna start

14:17.386 --> 14:18.385
Tidying up
your own bathroom?

14:18.387 --> 14:19.686
What are you
talking about?

14:19.688 --> 14:20.920
I tidy up
all the time.

14:20.922 --> 14:22.221
Uh, every time
I come over,

14:22.223 --> 14:23.422
There's dried globs
of toothpaste

14:23.424 --> 14:24.856
All over the sink.

14:24.858 --> 14:26.324
It's actually
quite disgusting.

14:26.326 --> 14:27.892
Well, I'm just trying
to be considerate.

14:27.894 --> 14:29.693
Because when
I wake up in the morning,

14:29.695 --> 14:31.394
Really early, to go jogging--
something that you never do--

14:31.396 --> 14:33.229
I just don't want to run
the water and wake you up.

14:33.231 --> 14:34.396
Oh, wow, touché.

14:34.398 --> 14:37.799
(two knocks on door)
man: You done in there?

14:37.801 --> 14:38.966
Just getting started.

14:38.968 --> 14:41.134
Please use the second floor.

14:41.136 --> 14:42.969
(phone buzzes)

14:42.971 --> 14:44.337
Nell, what do you got?

14:44.339 --> 14:46.906
Here's a little something
off the e-mail server.

14:46.908 --> 14:49.174
Two weeks ago,
plant manager westphal

14:49.176 --> 14:51.109
Refers to
an incident, quote:

14:51.111 --> 14:54.712
"not reported to the nrc
as no personnel were exposed

14:54.714 --> 14:56.980
And immediate corrective
actions were taken."

14:56.982 --> 14:58.214
Great.
Any other information?

14:58.216 --> 14:59.748
Like location,
date and time?

14:59.750 --> 15:00.882
No, nothing.

15:00.884 --> 15:02.016
I'm still digging for dirt.

15:02.018 --> 15:03.851
Hey. News from the hospital.

15:03.853 --> 15:05.419
Patterson is waking up.

15:05.421 --> 15:07.187
Okay, I'm gonna need
an update from granger.

15:07.189 --> 15:09.022
You'll be the first to know...

15:09.024 --> 15:10.056
Or maybe the second.

15:10.058 --> 15:11.424
Uh, possibly the third. Not...

15:11.426 --> 15:12.758
Lower than the third.
Wow.

15:12.760 --> 15:14.326
Okay, thank you
eric. Bye-bye.

15:14.328 --> 15:16.227
Doesn't the, uh,
security department have

15:16.229 --> 15:18.229
Some sort of policy
on facial hair?

15:18.231 --> 15:21.165
Yeah, no, I have to lose
the beard in 24 hours.

15:21.167 --> 15:23.200
But it's fine, 'cause
I get to keep the moustache.

15:23.202 --> 15:24.701
No, you don't.
Yeah, I do.

15:24.703 --> 15:26.869
Actually, a lot of amazing
men have moustaches.

15:26.871 --> 15:28.237
Like albert einstein,
salvador dali...

15:28.239 --> 15:30.405
And also ron jeremy.

15:31.274 --> 15:32.940
No moustache.

15:32.942 --> 15:34.408
Really?

15:34.409 --> 15:35.875
You got a problem
with albert einstein?

15:35.878 --> 15:37.010
E=mc squared?

15:38.813 --> 15:40.212
It's ridiculous.

15:40.214 --> 15:42.214
It's a very smart move.

15:42.216 --> 15:43.748
We're wasting
valuable time.

15:43.750 --> 15:45.049
Look, it'll be quick.

15:45.051 --> 15:46.950
It's fast food,
a drive-through.
Really?

15:46.952 --> 15:48.251
Mr. "my body
is my temple"

15:48.253 --> 15:49.785
Wants to chow down
on burgers and fries?

15:49.787 --> 15:51.086
Did you not see
that employee cafeteria?

15:51.088 --> 15:52.754
I saw quinoa
at the salad bar.

15:52.756 --> 15:54.922
I prefer food that
doesn't glow in the dark.

15:54.924 --> 15:56.223
Well, it might
help you fight crime.

15:56.225 --> 15:58.225
Worked for spiderman,
you know.

15:58.227 --> 16:00.293
Radioactive blood and all.

16:00.295 --> 16:02.161
Is that a
parking ticket?

16:10.170 --> 16:13.404
"meet me at north stairwell,
ground level, soon as possible."

16:13.406 --> 16:16.006
Looks like somebody
wants to have a chat.

16:16.008 --> 16:18.308
Or somebody
doesn't want us here.

16:30.422 --> 16:32.488
¶ ¶

16:35.459 --> 16:37.992
Over here.

16:37.994 --> 16:39.793
Dr. Chadmont.

16:39.795 --> 16:40.927
Step away
from the building.

16:40.929 --> 16:42.962
It avoids
the security camera.

16:42.964 --> 16:45.264
What's going on?
I should not
be doing this.

16:45.266 --> 16:48.000
Look, if you've got
something that's gonna
help our investigation...

16:48.002 --> 16:50.002
Look, they're
gonna lie to you.

16:50.004 --> 16:51.470
Westphal's not
gonna let us talk,

16:51.472 --> 16:53.905
And-and no one's
gonna tell you the truth.

16:53.907 --> 16:55.072
What's the truth?

16:55.074 --> 16:56.873
This plant is not safe.

16:56.875 --> 16:58.207
In what way?

16:58.209 --> 17:00.209
There was a dangerous drop
in the water level

17:00.211 --> 17:01.843
In the spent fuel pool,

17:01.845 --> 17:03.845
And significant radiation's
been released.

17:03.847 --> 17:06.280
Exposing the security guard?
Possibly; I don't know--
but I just know

17:06.282 --> 17:07.314
There's a big cover-up.

17:07.316 --> 17:08.665
If it's a safety issue,

17:08.666 --> 17:10.015
They have to report it
to the authorities.

17:10.018 --> 17:12.151
It would cost millions
in engineering upgrades.

17:12.153 --> 17:16.255
This plant is a disaster
waiting to happen.

17:16.257 --> 17:19.258
Rest is essential
for his recovery.
Granger: I'll be brief.

17:19.260 --> 17:20.826
Where's the wife?
Lying down.

17:20.828 --> 17:22.360
She had a few braxton
hicks contractions.

17:22.362 --> 17:23.928
False labor.

17:23.930 --> 17:25.262
Hugh?

17:25.264 --> 17:26.363
Hugh, this is

17:26.365 --> 17:29.899
Assistant director
granger from ncis.

17:29.901 --> 17:32.234
Good afternoon, sir.

17:32.236 --> 17:34.202
I just have
a few questions.

17:34.204 --> 17:36.470
Fire away.

17:36.472 --> 17:40.073
At santa flora, did
you ever work near
the spent fuel rods?

17:40.075 --> 17:42.408
Inside the
pool building?

17:42.410 --> 17:44.376
(exhales)
once.

17:44.378 --> 17:45.276
When was that?

17:45.278 --> 17:47.578
Three weeks ago,

17:47.580 --> 17:50.180
Middle of the night.

17:50.182 --> 17:52.215
I was video monitor.

17:52.217 --> 17:54.217
Saw an open door.

17:54.219 --> 17:55.585
Went to lock up.

17:55.587 --> 17:58.287
Did you actually enter
the building?

17:59.256 --> 18:01.256
Took a lap.

18:01.258 --> 18:02.924
Checked the doors.

18:02.926 --> 18:05.026
What happened then?

18:06.429 --> 18:08.595
Off shift 3:00 a.M.

18:08.597 --> 18:10.263
Anything else unusual?

18:10.265 --> 18:13.965
Drove home, went to bed.

18:16.035 --> 18:17.401
Oh.

18:17.403 --> 18:21.405
The next morning,
I had a stomach bug.

18:21.407 --> 18:24.574
A little vomiting, diarrhea.

18:24.576 --> 18:26.242
I was fine after that.

18:26.244 --> 18:28.177
Timing is perfect.

18:28.178 --> 18:30.111
Intestinal tract is
most sensitive to radiation.

18:30.114 --> 18:32.414
And do you remember
the exact date?

18:32.416 --> 18:33.915
(exhales)

18:33.917 --> 18:37.351
It was a...

18:37.353 --> 18:39.086
Tuesday.

18:39.088 --> 18:40.353
Did you notice the water level?

18:42.390 --> 18:44.990
(alarms beeping rapidly)

18:48.161 --> 18:50.294
Gunny? Gunny?

18:50.296 --> 18:52.029
(alarms continue beeping)

18:52.031 --> 18:53.497
Low blood pressure, high fever.
He has an infection

18:53.499 --> 18:55.432
In his blood stream.
Give us a few minutes.

18:55.434 --> 18:56.566
Draw blood cultures

18:56.568 --> 18:59.535
And lactic acid,
bolus two liters saline.

18:59.537 --> 19:01.036
Hang pip-tazo

19:01.038 --> 19:02.937
And 400
of ciprofloxacin.

19:04.273 --> 19:06.239
Tuesday, December 29,
the graveyard shift.

19:06.241 --> 19:07.406
Something happened
that night.

19:07.408 --> 19:09.097
Something
you should've mentioned

19:09.098 --> 19:10.787
When we asked
were there any accidents.

19:10.788 --> 19:12.477
No, it wasn't an accident--
there was an alarm at 4:00 a.M.,

19:12.479 --> 19:15.079
But no one was in the
spent fuel building.
You sure about that?

19:15.081 --> 19:17.214
We have surveillance video.
A secondary system kicked in

19:17.216 --> 19:19.049
And filled the pool--
no harm, no foul.

19:19.051 --> 19:20.583
Then why were we told
your plant's unsafe?

19:22.553 --> 19:24.586
From leo?

19:24.588 --> 19:26.588
Leo chadmont?
Look...

19:26.590 --> 19:28.356
There's a lot
you guys don't know.

19:28.358 --> 19:29.657
When the plant
was decommissioned,

19:29.659 --> 19:31.425
Leo took a serious pay cut.

19:31.427 --> 19:32.626
Things got rough,

19:32.628 --> 19:34.127
He lost his house,
ugly divorce,

19:34.129 --> 19:35.461
Kid dropped out
of school.

19:35.463 --> 19:36.929
Leo's bitter, okay?
Take what he says

19:36.931 --> 19:38.096
With a grain of salt.

19:38.098 --> 19:39.530
We're all cued up.

19:39.532 --> 19:41.131
All right.

19:41.133 --> 19:43.633
4:07 a.M.
On the night in question.

19:43.635 --> 19:44.934
No one's in the building.

19:44.936 --> 19:46.635
You can tell
the alarm starts up

19:46.637 --> 19:47.969
By the flashing
enunciator lights.

19:47.971 --> 19:49.303
Callen:
Pool level's low.

19:49.305 --> 19:51.138
Sam:
Top of the rods are showing.

19:51.140 --> 19:53.140
Westphal:
Scan forward, please.

19:53.142 --> 19:56.576
So by 6:00 a.M., the pool
fills back up to a safe level.

19:56.578 --> 19:59.078
Per protocol, not one person
had set foot inside.

19:59.080 --> 20:00.546
Go back four hours.

20:00.548 --> 20:02.915
Patterson came in
before 3:00 a.M.

20:04.518 --> 20:06.317
(tapping keys)

20:06.319 --> 20:07.651
Oaks:
Weird.

20:07.653 --> 20:09.386
Let me check
on this.

20:11.456 --> 20:12.988
What's the problem?

20:12.990 --> 20:14.122
Well, everything's
fine after 4:00 a.M.

20:14.124 --> 20:16.124
Before, there's
a video glitch.

20:16.126 --> 20:17.458
Oh, now we're
good, here it is.

20:17.460 --> 20:19.092
Before the pool
level dropped.

20:19.094 --> 20:22.128
Sam: 1:02 a.M.
And then back to snow.

20:22.130 --> 20:23.262
Westphal:
Mm-hmm.

20:23.264 --> 20:24.596
So from 1:00 a.M. To 4:00 a.M.

20:24.598 --> 20:26.130
You've got a gap
in your video surveillance.

20:26.132 --> 20:27.998
This system gets backed up?

20:28.000 --> 20:30.133
Every morning at 5:00 a.M., it
streams to an off-site facility.

20:30.135 --> 20:31.467
And how do we
access that?

20:33.437 --> 20:36.104
Sorry, checked
with our backup service.

20:36.106 --> 20:37.105
Same gap.

20:37.107 --> 20:39.107
1:02 to 4:07.

20:39.109 --> 20:40.274
We got nada.

20:40.276 --> 20:42.276
That means if somebody
went in to erase it...

20:42.278 --> 20:44.711
They did it before
the daily backup.

20:44.713 --> 20:46.479
Let's get this hard drive
into ops, huh?

20:50.518 --> 20:52.184
(whistles)
blake griffin.

20:52.186 --> 20:53.518
Oh, it's coming
down to the buzzer.

20:53.520 --> 20:55.052
Blake griffin for three.

20:55.054 --> 20:56.353
Nothing but bottom
of the... (laughs)

20:57.656 --> 20:59.188
No, no.

20:59.190 --> 21:00.322
Deeks, you're gonna
contaminate my evidence

21:00.324 --> 21:01.656
From westphal's shredder.

21:01.658 --> 21:03.124
Oh, nice.

21:03.126 --> 21:04.191
Ugh.

21:05.294 --> 21:06.626
That's a lot
of salsa.

21:06.628 --> 21:07.627
That's gross.

21:07.629 --> 21:09.161
Um...

21:09.163 --> 21:10.629
What did you find
out from security?

21:10.631 --> 21:12.964
I believe
I was exposed.
What?

21:12.966 --> 21:15.433
To the toxicity of the vending
machine's chimichangas.

21:15.435 --> 21:17.301
Seriously,
my tummy hurts.

21:17.303 --> 21:18.752
Uh, also...

21:18.753 --> 21:20.202
I saw patterson's
radiation badge report.

21:20.205 --> 21:21.971
And?
(quiet blipping)

21:26.576 --> 21:28.142
Come here.

21:28.144 --> 21:31.144
(blipping continues)

21:33.982 --> 21:35.314
Go ahead, nell.

21:35.316 --> 21:36.715
Hey, do you have
eyes on callen?

21:36.717 --> 21:37.716
He's still
with the suits.

21:37.718 --> 21:39.401
Something from the drive?

21:39.402 --> 21:41.085
Whoever destroyed the
video wasn't very savvy.

21:41.088 --> 21:43.221
They simply deleted it
and emptied the trash.

21:43.223 --> 21:45.223
Yeah, rather than
perform a clean wipe.

21:45.225 --> 21:47.258
So the footage
could still exist.

21:47.260 --> 21:48.259
Sweet.

21:48.261 --> 21:49.593
Eric:
Uh, not so sweet.

21:49.595 --> 21:51.461
Most of the file fragments
were overwritten

21:51.463 --> 21:52.462
In the last three weeks.

21:52.464 --> 21:54.731
Even with ram analysis,

21:54.732 --> 21:56.999
We're only recovering pixelated
bits and pieces at best.

21:57.001 --> 21:59.534
Here, take a look
at what we found.

21:59.536 --> 22:01.536
1:11 a.M.

22:01.538 --> 22:03.204
Water level's
still high.

22:03.206 --> 22:04.538
Eric: All right,
same at 1:24.

22:04.540 --> 22:06.540
But then at 2:09...

22:06.542 --> 22:08.174
Deeks: Patterson enters
and walks around the pool.

22:08.176 --> 22:09.926
We already know this.

22:09.927 --> 22:11.677
Take another look...
At the water level.

22:11.679 --> 22:13.679
Oh, wow, it's down,
it's really low.

22:13.681 --> 22:15.213
Yeah, and no alarms
are sounding.

22:15.215 --> 22:17.248
That didn't happen
until after 4:00 a.M.

22:17.250 --> 22:20.251
So the water's low
for two hours with no alarms.

22:20.253 --> 22:22.119
Patterson's radiation
badge showed

22:22.121 --> 22:23.687
That he was exposed
to a hundred rems.

22:23.689 --> 22:26.222
Whoa! Plant workers
are only allowed

22:26.224 --> 22:28.291
Five rems
of radiation per year.

22:28.292 --> 22:30.359
Whoa, hold the phone,
get me callen.
Why? What happened?

22:30.361 --> 22:32.094
I just found
the smoking gun.

22:32.096 --> 22:34.162
¶ ¶

22:38.668 --> 22:40.067
(tires screech)

22:40.069 --> 22:42.069
Out of the car, chadmont.

22:42.071 --> 22:43.270
Now.

22:45.207 --> 22:46.539
Where you going?

22:46.541 --> 22:48.374
Uh, to lunch.

22:48.376 --> 22:49.508
I'm hungry too,
can we join you?

22:49.510 --> 22:51.410
What's this about?

22:51.411 --> 22:53.311
You said the water level was
down, exposing the fuel rods.

22:53.313 --> 22:54.779
How could
that happen?

22:54.781 --> 22:57.314
It was a... It was
a system error.

22:57.316 --> 22:59.516
Water flowed from the cooling
pool into the empty reactor.

22:59.518 --> 23:01.317
Uh, a valve malfunctioned.

23:01.319 --> 23:03.319
That's funny.
So did the alarm system.

23:03.321 --> 23:04.553
But these are the kind
of safety concerns

23:04.555 --> 23:05.720
That I was talking about.

23:05.722 --> 23:06.721
Callen:
Three malfunctions.

23:06.723 --> 23:08.255
The valve, the alarm,

23:08.257 --> 23:09.522
The security cameras.

23:09.524 --> 23:12.091
All defective
from 1:00 a.M. To 4:00 a.M.

23:12.093 --> 23:13.625
What are the odds?

23:13.627 --> 23:16.127
Someone would have
to have a pretty deep knowledge

23:16.129 --> 23:18.229
Of plant operations
to pull that off.

23:18.231 --> 23:19.663
What time
do you get off work?

23:19.665 --> 23:21.131
Around 6:30.

23:21.133 --> 23:22.332
Sometimes I stay a little later.

23:22.334 --> 23:24.267
In case you're burning
the midnight oil?

23:24.269 --> 23:28.804
Actually, it was about
an hour<i> after</i> midnight.

23:28.806 --> 23:31.473
We've got you leaving the spent
fuel building at 1:07 a.M.

23:31.475 --> 23:33.074
You must have been
a little nervous,

23:33.076 --> 23:34.708
Because you didn't shut
the door all the way.

23:34.710 --> 23:36.443
Sam:
Here's the problem.

23:36.445 --> 23:39.479
An alert security guard
went to investigate,

23:39.481 --> 23:42.315
And he was exposed
to a lethal dose of radiation.

23:42.317 --> 23:45.117
He may not make it.

23:46.086 --> 23:48.186
Nobody should have
been in there.

23:48.188 --> 23:50.288
Nobody was supposed to get hurt.

23:50.290 --> 23:52.373
Why'd you do it?

23:52.374 --> 23:54.457
Sam: The plant was
decommissioned,

23:54.460 --> 23:56.426
You took a pay cut,

23:56.428 --> 23:59.328
A thousand of your colleagues
lost their jobs.

23:59.330 --> 24:01.430
That could make you
pretty upset.

24:01.432 --> 24:02.581
You lost your wife,
you lost your house.

24:02.582 --> 24:03.731
What, are you just trying
to get even?

24:03.734 --> 24:05.734
Look,

24:05.736 --> 24:08.737
I'm trying to let the world know

24:08.739 --> 24:12.173
That the plant is not safe,
but no one is listening.

24:12.175 --> 24:14.175
We're decommissioned,
so that means

24:14.177 --> 24:15.809
That the water chemistry
is never checked,

24:15.811 --> 24:17.443
And-and tubes can rust.

24:17.445 --> 24:21.146
Safety and contingency plans
have been relaxed, cooling

24:21.148 --> 24:23.281
And backup systems
are never tested.

24:23.283 --> 24:25.783
So you stage
a nuclear accident?

24:25.785 --> 24:28.685
A small one,
a-a containable one,

24:28.687 --> 24:32.755
In order to draw attention
to the risks.

24:32.757 --> 24:35.390
But no one was supposed
to get harmed.

24:39.462 --> 24:41.328
Yeah, all right.

24:41.330 --> 24:43.196
Yeah.
Thank you, nell.

24:43.198 --> 24:45.198
Okay. Thanks, granger. Bye.

24:45.200 --> 24:46.532
(sighs)

24:46.534 --> 24:49.134
So what's going on
at the hospital?
(sighs)

24:49.136 --> 24:51.836
Patterson is still in critical
condition, unfortunately,

24:51.838 --> 24:55.206
But his wife went into labor,
and they had a healthy baby boy.

24:55.208 --> 24:56.440
Well, that's fantastic.

24:56.442 --> 24:58.308
Chadmont's in custody.

24:58.310 --> 25:00.376
He admitted to engineering
the water drop.

25:00.378 --> 25:01.910
Wow. Case closed.

25:01.912 --> 25:04.545
Guess I won't have to be seeing
that moustache after all.

25:04.547 --> 25:05.779
Oh, you don't think so?

25:05.781 --> 25:07.347
Soon as we get home,

25:07.349 --> 25:09.449
I'm busting out that
barbasol like it's 1983.
Ugh!

25:09.451 --> 25:11.517
(explosion thunders)

25:21.461 --> 25:23.327
(groans)
what the hell?!

25:23.329 --> 25:26.463
Yeah. Case definitely
<i>not</i> closed.

25:35.907 --> 25:37.606
(indistinct radio communication,
indistinct shouting)

25:37.608 --> 25:39.541
Kensi:
Where's chadmont?
Locked up with security.

25:39.543 --> 25:41.276
He denies any connection
to the explosion.

25:41.278 --> 25:42.844
It was a diesel
generator that blew.

25:42.846 --> 25:45.379
It's the backup power to the
water pumps for the pool.

25:45.381 --> 25:47.481
There's only one reason to
take out a backup generator.

25:47.483 --> 25:49.716
If you're also planning on
taking out the primary system.

25:53.955 --> 25:56.221
It's a news chopper.

25:56.223 --> 25:57.855
This should be
restricted airspace.

25:57.857 --> 25:59.223
Let's keep moving.

25:59.225 --> 26:00.424
Pipes cut
through the building.

26:02.628 --> 26:04.928
Check all the pipes.

26:04.930 --> 26:06.396
Kensi:
What are we looking for?

26:06.398 --> 26:08.231
Anything abnormal--

26:08.233 --> 26:11.300
A box, a bump, a defect.

26:18.809 --> 26:21.910
Oh, sam, you need to check this.

26:21.912 --> 26:23.912
Here.

26:23.914 --> 26:25.613
What you got?

26:25.615 --> 26:27.982
Oh. You got a timer.

26:27.984 --> 26:30.384
Haven't seen one of these
in a long time.

26:30.386 --> 26:31.551
Kensi:
It's a little skinny

26:31.553 --> 26:32.818
For an ied, right?

26:32.820 --> 26:34.719
It's a flex
linear-shaped charge.

26:34.721 --> 26:36.420
It'll cut this
thing like butter.

26:36.422 --> 26:38.422
Disabling the water supply
to the cooling pools.

26:38.424 --> 26:41.358
Sam: The water heats up
and boils off.
Kensi:
Exposing the rods.

26:42.427 --> 26:44.894
Nine minutes, five seconds
and counting.

26:44.896 --> 26:47.263
We need a bomb squad.

26:47.265 --> 26:48.931
There's no way they'll
be here in nine minutes.

26:48.933 --> 26:50.599
Pull up the surveillance video,

26:50.600 --> 26:52.266
Have them evacuate all
non-essential personnel.

26:52.269 --> 26:53.268
On it.
Kensi:
Done.

26:53.270 --> 26:55.303
Well...

26:55.305 --> 26:56.904
What do we do first?

26:56.906 --> 26:58.839
Got any liquid nitrogen on you?

27:00.242 --> 27:02.375
Ncis.

27:02.377 --> 27:03.909
So I heard.

27:03.911 --> 27:05.610
This one gives you
the best angle.

27:06.613 --> 27:08.312
(quiet beep)
yeah, I'm gonna
need a list

27:08.314 --> 27:10.247
Of every worker
that touched those pipes.

27:10.249 --> 27:11.848
No problem.
We put the contractor

27:11.850 --> 27:13.783
And all the painters
through a background check.

27:13.785 --> 27:15.951
Kensi: All right, keep an eye
on anybody who stops, lingers

27:15.953 --> 27:17.719
Or just slows down.

27:17.721 --> 27:18.886
Deeks:
Like that guy,

27:18.888 --> 27:19.920
Right there,
in the back.

27:19.922 --> 27:21.254
Kensi:
Okay, can you zoom in?

27:25.393 --> 27:26.725
I'll send it to ops.

27:26.727 --> 27:28.560
Wait a minute.
I know that guy.

27:28.562 --> 27:29.961
We saw him today.

27:29.963 --> 27:31.929
We did?
Yeah.

27:31.931 --> 27:34.598
He was a speaker at
the protest rally.

27:34.600 --> 27:36.032
We ran facial rec

27:36.034 --> 27:38.300
On every protestor
you sent us this morning.

27:38.302 --> 27:39.634
And they're all clear.

27:39.636 --> 27:41.002
But we couldn't run
the speaker dude

27:41.004 --> 27:43.337
Because your best photo
only had him in profile.

27:43.339 --> 27:45.672
(computer chirps)
whoa. Whoa! Score.

27:46.941 --> 27:49.007
I just got his details
from the photo you sent me.

27:49.009 --> 27:52.577
Uh, rashad nader.
He's a u.S. Citizen.

27:52.579 --> 27:56.847
No overseas travel, but multiple
visits to jihadist web sites.

27:56.849 --> 27:58.916
This dude's homegrown.

27:58.917 --> 28:00.984
Okay, he doesn't work
for the painting company.

28:00.986 --> 28:04.354
Rents a house nearby,
and has multiple phone calls

28:04.356 --> 28:05.355
To chadmont.

28:05.357 --> 28:07.423
On it.

28:10.394 --> 28:12.026
You know who this is?

28:12.028 --> 28:13.961
'cause you've been chatting
him up on your cell phone.

28:13.963 --> 28:15.796
Yeah, he's, uh, active

28:15.798 --> 28:16.963
In the local
anti-nuke movement.

28:16.965 --> 28:18.364
Richard nader.
Kensi:
No, his name

28:18.366 --> 28:20.032
Is rashad, not richard,
and he's trying

28:20.034 --> 28:21.466
To sabotage the spent fuel pool.

28:21.468 --> 28:22.800
That's impossible.

28:22.802 --> 28:24.668
He's a...
He's a visiting professor

28:24.670 --> 28:27.437
Of environmental studies
from-from whitley tech.

28:27.439 --> 28:28.504
And did you verify that?

28:28.506 --> 28:29.771
I've got his business card.

28:29.773 --> 28:31.472
You got to be kidding me.
It's a fake.

28:31.474 --> 28:32.606
How did he get past security?

28:32.608 --> 28:34.975
I gave him a cloned I.D.

28:34.977 --> 28:38.545
To measure the radiation levels
on the night of the incident.

28:38.547 --> 28:41.414
He-he was an academic,
and I trusted him.

28:44.452 --> 28:46.351
Callen:
Red wire or the green wire?

28:46.353 --> 28:47.685
None of the above.

28:47.687 --> 28:49.386
It's a collapsing circuit.

28:49.388 --> 28:51.354
The power keeps
the switch open.

28:51.356 --> 28:52.722
You cut the wire, kaboom.

28:52.724 --> 28:54.523
Well, we got
about four minutes

28:54.525 --> 28:56.091
To come up with a better plan.

28:56.093 --> 28:58.426
I don't see an
anti-disturbance switch,

28:58.428 --> 29:01.629
No non-tampering device.

29:01.631 --> 29:03.697
Should be able
to move it.

29:03.699 --> 29:05.432
What, just peel it
off the pipe?

29:05.434 --> 29:07.066
Exactly.

29:07.068 --> 29:08.634
Support it from below.

29:08.636 --> 29:10.535
All right.
(clears his throat)

29:10.537 --> 29:11.769
You sure about this?

29:11.771 --> 29:13.771
99% sure.

29:13.773 --> 29:14.972
Oh, watch the knife.

29:14.974 --> 29:17.941
You almost got my finger there.

29:17.943 --> 29:20.343
All right.

29:20.345 --> 29:21.977
Watch your hand.

29:21.979 --> 29:23.979
(siren wailing, horn blaring)

29:23.981 --> 29:25.480
Kensi:
Talk to me, nell.

29:25.482 --> 29:26.714
Nell:
Local pd found

29:26.716 --> 29:28.382
Plastic explosives, initiators

29:28.384 --> 29:29.816
And timers in nader's garage.

29:29.818 --> 29:31.517
Everything
for a well-stocked jihadist.

29:31.519 --> 29:33.552
Where can we find him?

29:33.554 --> 29:35.120
He left santa flora
two hours ago.

29:35.122 --> 29:38.456
I got a hit on his credit card
at a local coffee shop.

29:38.458 --> 29:39.990
I'm sending you
the coordinates now.

29:39.992 --> 29:41.391
Great. On our way.

29:41.393 --> 29:42.959
How much time on that pipe bomb?

29:42.961 --> 29:45.428
If I'm in sync, 32 seconds.

29:45.430 --> 29:47.129
Sam:
<i> The firemen filled 'em up.</i>

29:47.131 --> 29:49.598
The drums are ready,
almost there.

29:49.600 --> 29:52.467
The end is stuck.
All right.

29:52.469 --> 29:54.969
(callen inhales, groans)

29:54.971 --> 29:56.503
(sighs)

29:56.505 --> 29:58.471
20 seconds. Go, go, go!

30:11.652 --> 30:13.618
I thought you said
I had 20 seconds.

30:14.721 --> 30:16.153
The water must have collapsed
the circuit.

30:16.155 --> 30:17.687
You could've told me.

30:17.689 --> 30:20.556
I would've run faster.

30:21.525 --> 30:24.626
Chadmont,
your buddy nader

30:24.628 --> 30:26.494
Almost triggered
a nuclear disaster.

30:26.496 --> 30:27.495
No, he didn't.

30:27.497 --> 30:29.080
What are you talking about?

30:29.081 --> 30:30.664
He was that close to destroying
the cooling system.

30:30.666 --> 30:33.133
No. Nader's an idiot.
He doesn't get it.

30:33.135 --> 30:34.868
Get what?
Look,

30:34.870 --> 30:37.537
Even if you cut off all the
fresh water supply to the pool,

30:37.539 --> 30:40.473
It's still gonna take days
for it to overheat and boil off.

30:40.475 --> 30:42.541
And at that point,
you bring in a water truck

30:42.543 --> 30:44.476
And a pump and a new generator.

30:44.478 --> 30:46.411
So the fuel rods
were never in danger?

30:47.113 --> 30:49.413
The public was never in danger?

30:49.415 --> 30:50.414
No.

30:50.416 --> 30:52.115
Unless it was a distraction.

30:52.117 --> 30:53.783
A distraction
for what?
Something bigger.

30:53.785 --> 30:56.185
Fastest way to drain a
bathtub, you pull the plug.

30:56.187 --> 30:59.021
Is there access
to the underside of the pool?

30:59.023 --> 31:00.922
Well, there's a utility room.

31:00.924 --> 31:02.456
Would nader's fake I.D. Get him
in there?

31:02.458 --> 31:05.192
(sighs)

31:10.999 --> 31:13.065
Bingo.

31:15.135 --> 31:18.936
Oh, man.
Looks like a cell
phone receiver?

31:18.938 --> 31:20.470
Sam:
On four bricks of c-4.

31:20.472 --> 31:23.873
Bomb squad eta
is six minutes.

31:23.875 --> 31:25.207
Whoa.

31:25.209 --> 31:27.742
Don't even breathe on it.

31:27.744 --> 31:29.643
That's a pendulum switch.

31:29.645 --> 31:31.878
We can't move this one.

31:31.880 --> 31:34.213
It's a steel-lined pool.

31:34.215 --> 31:35.948
Doesn't matter.

31:35.950 --> 31:38.517
It'll open a huge crater.

31:38.519 --> 31:41.219
The water pours out in a flash,
you can't refill the pool.

31:41.221 --> 31:45.223
Rods will heat up, burn,

31:45.225 --> 31:48.960
Then a hydrogen explosion
will cover southern california

31:48.962 --> 31:50.094
With a radioactive cloud.

31:50.096 --> 31:51.895
Just like fukushima.

31:51.897 --> 31:54.097
All right, so how
do we make it safe?

31:54.099 --> 31:56.165
That's a good question.

31:56.167 --> 32:00.169
If we fail, we don't have to
worry about radiation exposure.

32:00.171 --> 32:02.804
We'll never survive the blast.

32:02.806 --> 32:05.473
Not to mention
the 400,000 gallons of water

32:05.475 --> 32:07.041
Dumped on top of us.

32:19.020 --> 32:20.953
Hetty:
Owen, video link is up.

32:20.955 --> 32:24.623
Copy.
We need to pull your guys,
let the bomb squad take over.

32:24.625 --> 32:26.725
My agent's trained in eod.
Trained and unprotected.

32:26.727 --> 32:28.226
One second. Hanna.

32:28.228 --> 32:30.078
Sam:
Go ahead, granger.

32:30.079 --> 32:31.929
Can we send a robot in there?
I wouldn't.

32:31.931 --> 32:34.064
There's a hair-trigger
anti-tampering device.

32:34.066 --> 32:36.066
What about
a containment chamber?

32:36.068 --> 32:38.701
No, it's a tight squeeze. You'll
never get through the hole.

32:38.703 --> 32:40.102
We're looking
at a cell phone switch.

32:40.104 --> 32:42.104
Can you shut down
the local towers?

32:42.106 --> 32:46.208
A fine idea, mr. Hanna,
but not 100% reliable.

32:46.210 --> 32:48.176
This guy could've blown out
the pool hours ago.

32:48.178 --> 32:49.177
What's he waiting for?

32:49.179 --> 32:52.046
Owen, listen carefully.

32:52.048 --> 32:55.115
I want you to send away
all the first responders.

32:55.117 --> 32:56.516
Do it quickly.

32:56.518 --> 32:58.885
Are you serious?
I suspect he wants the place

32:58.887 --> 33:01.187
Crawling with rescue workers,

33:01.189 --> 33:03.189
Before he pulls the trigger,
to inflict

33:03.191 --> 33:04.790
Maximum damage.

33:04.792 --> 33:06.792
It's possible. Oaks.

33:06.794 --> 33:08.660
What do you got?

33:08.662 --> 33:10.928
We need to evacuate all
the cops and firefighters.

33:10.930 --> 33:12.663
Have them stage
half a mile away.

33:12.665 --> 33:13.864
What about the bomb squad?

33:13.866 --> 33:15.131
Send in one guy in a suit.

33:15.133 --> 33:16.832
Everyone else clears out.

33:16.834 --> 33:18.600
Let's go.

33:25.108 --> 33:28.642
There he is. Ten o'clock.

33:28.644 --> 33:31.911
Kensi: He's not
scrolling or texting.

33:31.913 --> 33:33.846
Could be watching tv.

33:33.848 --> 33:36.215
Deeks: Hmm.
<i>Spongebob's</i> on about now.

33:36.217 --> 33:38.217
If hetty's right, he's watching
the news feed, which is good.

33:38.219 --> 33:40.886
He's waiting.
If he knew
we're law enforcement,

33:40.888 --> 33:42.888
He would speed-dial that ied.

33:42.890 --> 33:44.189
Kensi: Which means...

33:44.191 --> 33:45.757
We have time for a coffee.

33:45.759 --> 33:47.325
I'll grab us a table.

33:47.327 --> 33:49.727
Our wonderful cell phone jammer
has a radius

33:49.729 --> 33:52.796
Of 50 feet, which
is perfect.
Fantastic.

33:54.132 --> 33:56.132
(grunts)

33:57.969 --> 33:59.635
Can't cut the wire.

33:59.637 --> 34:02.137
Another collapsing circuit?
You're a quick study.

34:02.139 --> 34:03.638
Callen:
We can't move it.

34:03.640 --> 34:05.006
Sam: Huh.

34:05.008 --> 34:07.141
There's one option,
but it's not ideal.

34:07.143 --> 34:11.578
If we can pull the initiators
out of the c-4

34:11.580 --> 34:13.780
Without jiggling the pendulum.
Hold on--

34:13.782 --> 34:15.915
Pull the blasting caps out
of the plastic explosives

34:15.917 --> 34:18.084
On a live circuit?

34:18.085 --> 34:20.252
Sam: If we can get them six
inches away before they blow,

34:20.254 --> 34:23.255
They won't ignite the plastics.

34:23.257 --> 34:24.990
There's four of 'em.

34:24.992 --> 34:27.826
One potato, two potato...

34:28.795 --> 34:31.862
Three potato, four?

34:32.798 --> 34:35.031
And if they blow?

34:35.033 --> 34:38.234
If inside the plastic...

34:38.236 --> 34:40.236
Nuclear disaster.

34:40.238 --> 34:43.172
If outside
the plastic,

34:43.174 --> 34:45.207
We lose a hand or an eye.

34:45.209 --> 34:47.876
I don't suppose
we get to choose, do we?

34:50.680 --> 34:52.012
Okay.

34:52.014 --> 34:53.947
Easy, g.

34:53.949 --> 34:55.748
Easy.

34:56.717 --> 34:58.783
(whistling)

35:00.052 --> 35:02.786
You watching tv?
You got wi-fi?

35:02.788 --> 35:05.321
From the coffee shop.
That's crazy,
'cause I got no reception.

35:05.323 --> 35:07.389
Do you need to log in
or is there a password?

35:07.391 --> 35:09.324
Or maybe I just need
to buy a scone?

35:09.326 --> 35:11.326
Aah!
Oh. Oh, my god. I'm so sorry.

35:11.328 --> 35:13.261
I'm so sorry. Here.
Aah! (stammering)
please, ple...

35:13.263 --> 35:14.262
I'm so, so sorry.

35:14.264 --> 35:15.329
You idiot!
I'm so sorry.

35:15.331 --> 35:16.330
Hey.

35:16.332 --> 35:17.864
Federal agents. Don't move.

35:17.866 --> 35:19.398
(gasping, screaming)
no!

35:19.400 --> 35:22.200
Everybody get down
and stay put! Get down!
Get down!

35:22.202 --> 35:24.202
Ma'am, get down!
Get down! Move!
Stay down!

35:24.204 --> 35:25.203
Let her go!
Stop!

35:25.205 --> 35:26.337
Kensi:
Get down.

35:28.240 --> 35:30.106
That pendulum's
starting to move.

35:30.108 --> 35:31.940
Just settle down.
Settle down.

35:35.412 --> 35:36.944
Let her go.

35:36.946 --> 35:38.278
Let her go.

35:39.047 --> 35:40.179
(screaming)

35:41.382 --> 35:42.414
Kensi: Second phone!

35:43.417 --> 35:45.417
(shouts, groans)

35:48.088 --> 35:49.353
Woman (in distance):
Yeah! I see him...

35:49.355 --> 35:51.655
Man (in distance):
You okay?

35:52.224 --> 35:54.190
Deeks:
That call connected.

35:54.192 --> 35:56.892
Deeks (over phone):
Sam, callen, get out of there!
Got to do it now, g.

35:56.894 --> 35:58.159
(callen grunts)

35:58.161 --> 36:00.227
Callen:
Blasting caps are gonna blow!

36:02.364 --> 36:03.796
(muffled boom)

36:03.798 --> 36:05.731
(grunts, groans)

36:07.367 --> 36:09.300
Hey, man...

36:09.302 --> 36:11.869
Hey... That was crazy, man.
You got some big ones.

36:11.871 --> 36:13.804
Very strong, my friend.
Thank you.

36:13.806 --> 36:15.871
Sam:
Hey.

36:18.208 --> 36:19.340
You're welcome.

36:20.343 --> 36:21.975
What the... What the hell?

36:21.977 --> 36:23.443
Somebody had to do it.

36:23.445 --> 36:25.378
You don't even have
any eod experience.

36:25.380 --> 36:28.314
I had infinite trust in hanna.

36:28.316 --> 36:29.315
Come on, come on.
We'll get you up.

36:29.317 --> 36:31.050
No.
Sam: Come on.

36:31.052 --> 36:32.384
The hell you will.

36:34.888 --> 36:36.387
(grunts)

36:44.062 --> 36:46.328
Sam:
Ain't that a bitch?

36:53.336 --> 36:56.070
Have we tidied
up the scene?

36:56.072 --> 36:59.073
U.S. Marshals
are taking chadmont.
Uh-huh.

36:59.075 --> 37:01.408
Yeah, we addressed all
his safety concerns.

37:01.410 --> 37:04.077
He'll enjoy hearing that
from federal prison.
(chuckles)

37:04.079 --> 37:06.913
Hetty, how did you know to pull
back the police and firemen?

37:06.915 --> 37:09.782
I trusted my gut.

37:09.784 --> 37:13.452
You risked the team
and millions of civilians

37:13.454 --> 37:14.953
On a gut instinct?

37:14.955 --> 37:19.823
That and 2,000 years
of military history.

37:19.825 --> 37:21.858
The technique

37:21.860 --> 37:25.127
Of strategic envelopment
was a favorite

37:25.129 --> 37:28.430
Of sun tzu, alexander the great,

37:28.432 --> 37:30.799
Napoleon bonaparte...

37:30.801 --> 37:33.868
What has been
is what will be.

37:33.870 --> 37:37.004
There is nothing new
under the sun.

37:37.006 --> 37:38.338
(slow footsteps approaching)

37:38.340 --> 37:41.107
Oh, my.

37:41.109 --> 37:42.508
Really, owen?

37:42.510 --> 37:45.878
Uh, seemed like a better idea
at the time.

37:45.880 --> 37:47.179
What'd the doctor say?

37:47.181 --> 37:48.213
Multiple contusions,

37:48.215 --> 37:51.149
Couple of cracked ribs.
Nothing

37:51.151 --> 37:55.919
That a 30-year single-vineyard
cognac can't heal.

37:57.355 --> 37:58.787
A toast...

37:58.789 --> 38:00.221
To hetty's gut.

38:00.223 --> 38:02.223
Oh, thank you
very much.

38:02.225 --> 38:04.291
Long may it lead.

38:05.927 --> 38:07.993
Hetty:
And to owen.

38:11.498 --> 38:14.031
Jamie.

38:14.033 --> 38:16.366
His lungs filled
with fluid.

38:16.368 --> 38:19.402
They paralyzed him and put him
on a breathing machine.

38:19.404 --> 38:22.171
He's tough.
He's hanging in there.

38:23.140 --> 38:25.807
He stopped breathing.

38:25.809 --> 38:29.944
Jamie, you can come in now.

38:30.913 --> 38:33.412
Will you hold him,
please?

38:35.349 --> 38:37.349
Um...
Please?

38:37.351 --> 38:40.051
Uh, yeah, I guess so.

38:43.990 --> 38:47.458
Just make sure
to support his head.
Okay.

38:47.460 --> 38:50.461
(fussing)
shh.

38:50.463 --> 38:53.197
Shh...

38:53.199 --> 38:55.399
He's so beautiful.

38:55.401 --> 38:56.867
Thank you.

38:56.869 --> 38:58.869
You are.

38:58.871 --> 39:01.404
(crying)
it's okay.

39:01.406 --> 39:04.507
(kensi shushing,
baby crying)

39:04.509 --> 39:06.342
Want me to call a nurse?

39:06.344 --> 39:08.410
(shushing,
crying continues)

39:11.882 --> 39:13.481
(crying stops)
wow, look at you.

39:13.483 --> 39:15.483
Where'd you learn that?

39:15.485 --> 39:18.018
I had to babysit
in middle school.

39:18.020 --> 39:19.486
What, at camp lejeune?

39:19.488 --> 39:24.323
Well, I needed to make my own
money to buy ammo at the px.

39:24.325 --> 39:28.093
(fusses briefly)
shh...

39:28.095 --> 39:30.395
He could grow up
without a dad.

39:32.332 --> 39:35.565
Yeah, but his dad's a hero.

39:39.170 --> 39:42.237
Hugh, you're a daddy.

39:44.541 --> 39:45.873
(crying)

39:45.875 --> 39:47.341
Do you know
any lullabies?

39:47.343 --> 39:49.943
Me? Yeah, no.
No. No lullabies.

39:49.945 --> 39:51.411
I'm pretty sure
"twinkle, twinkle" is okay.

39:51.413 --> 39:52.879
Everybody knows that one.

39:52.881 --> 39:54.847
(baby crying)

39:54.849 --> 39:58.584
¶ twinkle, twinkle,
little star ¶

39:58.586 --> 40:03.121
¶ how I wonder what you are ¶

40:03.123 --> 40:04.122
¶ up ab... ¶

40:04.124 --> 40:05.323
(baby quiets)

40:05.325 --> 40:07.892
Both:
¶ above the world so high ¶

40:07.894 --> 40:12.930
¶ like a diamond in the sky... ¶

40:12.932 --> 40:14.531
Kensi:
<i> Keep going. It's working.</i>

40:14.533 --> 40:15.598
