Star, let's go.
We've been here for hours.

00:50.684 --> 00:54.853
No. We are not leaving until
the old donuts get thrown out.

00:54.855 --> 00:56.455
( whistling )

01:05.732 --> 01:08.901
- Evening, Marco.
- Evening, Pete.

01:08.903 --> 01:10.836
Ah!

01:10.838 --> 01:12.838
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.773
Star. Some lady
just got your donuts.

01:14.775 --> 01:16.608
What?

01:16.610 --> 01:18.444
( shuddering )

01:25.785 --> 01:27.786
Mina.

01:27.788 --> 01:30.856
You're Mina Loveberry.

01:30.858 --> 01:32.758
You caught me.
Are you a cop?

01:32.760 --> 01:34.893
That's Mina Loveberry.

01:34.895 --> 01:36.595
I have no idea
who that is.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.964
Marco, she's
the greatest warrior

01:38.966 --> 01:42.401
- to ever live.
- Uh, her?

01:42.403 --> 01:44.770
I lost my bag.
Has anyone seen
my bag?

01:44.772 --> 01:46.705
That's a lady who's
lost her marbles.

01:46.707 --> 01:49.241
No, she's
Mina Loveberry.

01:49.243 --> 01:52.377
- Hello.
- Mewni's greatest
protector.

01:52.379 --> 01:54.913
At least, I think
that's her.

01:54.915 --> 01:56.782
Well, why don't you
see for yourself?

01:56.784 --> 01:58.917
No, no, no.
Marco, no!

01:58.919 --> 02:01.753
- Hello, Mina.
- Hello.

02:01.755 --> 02:03.222
What are you doing
on Earth?

02:03.224 --> 02:07.493
I'm on vacation.
Doctor's orders.

02:07.495 --> 02:08.760
What are you gonna do
on your vacation?

02:08.762 --> 02:11.497
I will let the soul
be my guide

02:11.499 --> 02:13.732
and wander off
to the depths

02:13.734 --> 02:15.467
of this unseen planet.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.269
Wow!

02:17.271 --> 02:19.071
That's what you say
when you've lost your marbles.

02:19.073 --> 02:21.473
Marco, just...

02:21.475 --> 02:23.675
There is actually
a really great park
across the street.

02:23.677 --> 02:25.644
Fantastic!

02:25.646 --> 02:27.679
The perfect place
to view humanity

02:27.681 --> 02:29.748
at its most docile.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.750
I will leave
in two seconds.

02:34.454 --> 02:37.456
Boy, what a weirdo.
Star?

02:37.458 --> 02:39.258
Oh, no.

02:39.260 --> 02:41.026
Wait. Wait, Mina.
Wait.

02:41.028 --> 02:43.862
Teach me your way,
O great warrior.

02:43.864 --> 02:46.832
Hmm. Yeah. Okay.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.667
Really?

02:48.669 --> 02:50.669
O great Mina,
you will not be disappointed.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.671
But ain't nothin'
for free.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.606
You're gonna have to do
something for me.

02:54.608 --> 02:56.375
Anything.

02:56.377 --> 02:57.976
Get this bag
off my head.

02:57.978 --> 03:00.379
Ooh, ow.
A, E, I, O, U!

03:01.681 --> 03:04.683
Welcome to the Echo Creek
Mud Pits.

03:04.685 --> 03:07.886
Here, we will answer
all of your questions
about mud.

03:07.888 --> 03:09.388
Finally.

03:09.390 --> 03:12.858
Today, I go
where Mina goes.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.459
Look at us; we're already
basically best friends.

03:14.461 --> 03:16.528
Inseparable.

03:16.530 --> 03:20.899
Boy, are you guys in for
a real educational treat today.

03:20.901 --> 03:22.467
Lesson number first.

03:22.469 --> 03:24.736
In becoming
a great warrior,

03:24.738 --> 03:26.672
one must cleanse
their mind

03:26.674 --> 03:27.806
from sinking thought.

03:27.808 --> 03:31.977
So... just don't think?

03:31.979 --> 03:33.879
Don't think.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.314
Oh, it feels so good.

03:35.316 --> 03:37.916
Oh!

03:37.918 --> 03:41.753
We are mud sisters.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.322
Wait a second.

03:43.324 --> 03:45.057
Where's my camera,
where's my telescope,

03:45.059 --> 03:46.725
where's my sketch pad?
What the heck is that?

03:46.727 --> 03:48.427
Observe the wooly mammoth,

03:48.429 --> 03:50.729
who may or may not have
walked through these mud pits

03:50.731 --> 03:52.931
19 million years ago.

03:52.933 --> 03:54.499
We're not really sure.

03:54.501 --> 03:56.868
Ride, my great beast.

03:56.870 --> 04:00.372
Ride to the cloud city
of Cloudlandia!

04:00.374 --> 04:02.574
Get down, ya weirdo.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.776
Come on, big boy.
Let's get to movin'.

04:04.778 --> 04:07.679
Uh, ma'am, you leave
that mammoth alone.

04:07.681 --> 04:11.383
I command ye to move.

04:11.385 --> 04:13.418
That's it. I'm comin' in
to get you, ma'am.

04:13.420 --> 04:15.420
Sorry, you can't
be doin' that.

04:15.422 --> 04:16.555
Whoa, goin' down.

04:16.557 --> 04:18.724
What a cruel
twist of fate.

04:18.726 --> 04:20.792
Star, she's
clearly lost it.

04:20.794 --> 04:23.562
I am the conqueror
of the beast.

04:23.564 --> 04:25.130
No autographs.

04:25.132 --> 04:26.732
Lesson number one, Marco.

04:26.734 --> 04:28.934
Just stop thinkin'.

04:28.936 --> 04:31.970
Now, class,
meaning you,

04:31.972 --> 04:34.940
our next lesson is of
utmost importance

04:34.942 --> 04:37.976
to the survival
of a warrior.

04:37.978 --> 04:40.746
We're gonna learn how to
make some weapons.

04:40.748 --> 04:46.318
The higher I go,
the closer I get
to reaching the stars.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.620
Be resourceful with
finding material.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.422
( girl screams )

04:50.424 --> 04:52.090
See? Now I have
a sturdy chain

04:52.092 --> 04:53.625
to chain stuff with.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.327
Easy breezy taco peasy.

04:55.329 --> 04:56.995
Go make your own
warrior weapon.

04:56.997 --> 04:59.398
All right, Star,
you got this.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.500
It's just like
arts and crafts,

05:01.502 --> 05:03.001
but with weapons.

05:03.003 --> 05:04.836
Which ones are yours?

05:04.838 --> 05:06.071
( sighs )
Those two.

05:06.073 --> 05:07.439
( screaming )

05:07.441 --> 05:08.807
Oh, bless your soul.

05:08.809 --> 05:12.611
Come on, Star,
anything can be a weapon.

05:12.613 --> 05:14.413
Oh, my goodness.

05:14.415 --> 05:15.814
Look at this string.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.683
How lucky could I be?

05:17.685 --> 05:19.017
And what is this?

05:19.019 --> 05:21.019
A pine cone?

05:21.021 --> 05:22.988
Everything's comin' up Star.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.090
Let go of my bat,
you naughty lady.

05:25.092 --> 05:27.859
Mina, did you finish
building your weapon yet?

05:27.861 --> 05:31.697
I have created
the most deadly of maces.

05:31.699 --> 05:33.999
Awesome!

05:34.001 --> 05:36.034
You know, I'm actually
pretty proud of mine, too.

05:36.036 --> 05:38.370
Uh, kazza kazza wha?

05:38.372 --> 05:41.173
It is a pine cone
tied to a string,

05:41.175 --> 05:44.309
and then, I put some flowers
on it and drew a face.

05:44.311 --> 05:46.211
I call him Davey.

05:46.213 --> 05:48.613
Fantastic!
Ho!

05:48.615 --> 05:50.382
Ho!

05:50.384 --> 05:53.719
When they turn
18, they're the
government's problem.

05:53.721 --> 05:56.455
Hot dogs here.

05:56.457 --> 05:58.490
Get your hot dogs.

05:58.492 --> 05:59.991
Hot dogs.

05:59.993 --> 06:01.026
Lesson number  <i>tres.</i>

06:01.028 --> 06:03.295
You gotta gather intel.

06:03.297 --> 06:04.896
Sh, someone may be listening.

06:04.898 --> 06:06.965
Learn from
your new surroundings.

06:06.967 --> 06:09.134
Learn from new
surroundings.

06:09.136 --> 06:12.003
Oh, sorry.
I didn't know
it was a wig.

06:12.005 --> 06:14.072
Who is your ruler
on this planet?

06:14.074 --> 06:16.241
Not from around here,
are we?

06:16.243 --> 06:18.977
- She's a foreigner.
- Oh, how exotic.

06:18.979 --> 06:22.247
This is the United States
of America.

06:22.249 --> 06:25.183
We don't have any rulers here.
We're free.

06:25.185 --> 06:28.687
But who makes the rules?

06:28.689 --> 06:30.389
We make our own rules

06:30.391 --> 06:34.326
through the radical
process of voting.

06:34.328 --> 06:37.362
( screeching )
Just trying to wrap
my head around this.

06:37.364 --> 06:39.898
You mean you vote if you
can do something or not?

06:39.900 --> 06:42.768
That's right,
little lady.

06:42.770 --> 06:46.538
- So I can do this?
- Sure.

06:46.540 --> 06:48.673
- And this, too?
- You betcha.

06:48.675 --> 06:50.108
Is this legal?

06:50.110 --> 06:51.910
Actually,
that's arson.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.045
Freedom!

06:54.047 --> 06:56.281
ALL: Freedom!

06:56.283 --> 06:59.050
MINA: No chains
or limitations.
I'm freedom!

06:59.052 --> 07:01.386
We have learned there are
no rules on this planet.

07:01.388 --> 07:04.022
It's an anything goes
fight to the death.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.590
Star, wait.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.025
You've gotta stop this.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.560
Stop what?
What am I doing?

07:08.562 --> 07:11.630
You guys ruined
the entire park today.

07:11.632 --> 07:14.933
Marco, Mina was my idol
growing up.

07:14.935 --> 07:18.069
Imagine if you randomly
met your idol one day,

07:18.071 --> 07:21.206
- and didn't
follow them around.
- But your idol is bananas.

07:21.208 --> 07:24.142
Look, thanks for trying
to look out for me.

07:24.144 --> 07:26.978
But I'm gonna go train
with my hero.

07:26.980 --> 07:30.048
- Fine. I'm just gonna
enjoy the park by myself.
- ( siren )

07:30.050 --> 07:34.052
Sir, we're gonna have to
ask you a couple questions.

07:34.054 --> 07:36.221
All right, step one.

07:36.223 --> 07:38.790
Just stop thinking.

07:38.792 --> 07:42.060
Step two,
make a weapon.

07:42.062 --> 07:45.430
Step  <i>tres,</i>
<i>gather intel.</i>

07:45.432 --> 07:47.232
( panting )

07:47.234 --> 07:49.401
Mina, I made it!

07:49.403 --> 07:51.570
Come, little mud face.

07:51.572 --> 07:54.639
You must partake in
the warrior's ritual.

07:54.641 --> 07:57.375
Step inside
the circle of animals.

08:00.980 --> 08:03.248
- Now, repeat these words:
- Repeat these words.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.484
- Not these words,
the ones coming.
- Right. Sorry.

08:05.486 --> 08:08.119
O great battle lords.

08:08.121 --> 08:09.688
O great battle lords.

08:09.690 --> 08:12.791
- Please protect us.
- Please protect us.

08:12.793 --> 08:15.293
Carry our foes off to
the depths of space and time

08:15.295 --> 08:18.263
so they may forever live in
the ruins of our victory.

08:18.265 --> 08:20.031
( muttering gibberish )...
victory.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.867
Lead us to the battle,

08:21.869 --> 08:24.803
and you shall bathe in
our conquests. Ha!

08:24.805 --> 08:27.639
( making weird noises )

08:27.641 --> 08:29.841
So, mud sister,

08:29.843 --> 08:31.843
what are we battling?

08:31.845 --> 08:33.812
Some demons? Gargoyles?

08:33.814 --> 08:35.814
- Them people.
- Joggers?

08:35.816 --> 08:37.282
No, ding-dong.

08:37.284 --> 08:41.119
All the people
of this forsaken planet.

08:41.121 --> 08:44.222
( laughs )
No. You don't mean that.

08:44.224 --> 08:46.057
That's wacky talk.

08:46.059 --> 08:49.661
What these little ants
lack is a ruler.

08:49.663 --> 08:53.365
And guess who's
gonna give 'em one?
Bink.

08:53.367 --> 08:58.303
- Now, kneel before
your new ruler.
- Okay.

08:58.305 --> 09:01.239
We're gonna have
so much fun rulin'
these folks.

09:01.241 --> 09:02.841
I've made a huge mistake.

09:02.843 --> 09:06.378
So a gonzo donut collector
came out of a dumpster.

09:06.380 --> 09:08.547
- Uh-huh.
- To teach your friend,

09:08.549 --> 09:11.182
another gonzo donut collector
in a dumpster.

09:11.184 --> 09:12.684
- Yep.
- And together,

09:12.686 --> 09:14.986
they destroyed
a family park?

09:14.988 --> 09:16.555
Yeah. If I was trying
to cover my butt,

09:16.557 --> 09:18.089
I'd say the exact
same thing.

09:18.091 --> 09:20.358
MINA: Kneel before
me, minions.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.260
I am the greatest warrior

09:22.262 --> 09:25.363
that this world
has ever known!

09:25.365 --> 09:28.166
( siren wailing )

09:28.168 --> 09:30.101
Let's ride.

09:30.103 --> 09:32.270
Mina, I can't
take over the Earth.

09:32.272 --> 09:35.173
Aw, of course you can.
You're a warrior now.

09:35.175 --> 09:38.276
Now let's start by
rounding up the rest
of these folks,

09:38.278 --> 09:40.278
and pushin' 'em off
this here ledge.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.746
( nervous giggle )

09:41.748 --> 09:44.015
Mina, I care about Earth.

09:44.017 --> 09:45.350
I don't wanna conquer it.

09:45.352 --> 09:48.520
I thought you cared about
being a warrior.

09:53.259 --> 09:55.093
I guess I thought
being a warrior

09:55.095 --> 09:56.227
was something different.

09:56.229 --> 09:58.263
Uh, excuse me, miss.

09:58.265 --> 10:01.299
- Don't we get
a vote in this?
- ALL: Yeah!

10:01.301 --> 10:03.068
What are you,
a bunch of comedians?

10:03.070 --> 10:05.570
We ain't votin' on this.
I'm your ruler now.

10:05.572 --> 10:08.640
Mm, all those in favor
of the crazy lady

10:08.642 --> 10:10.809
being our new ruler,
raise your hands.

10:13.779 --> 10:15.647
One, two...
six. okay.

10:15.649 --> 10:17.115
All those opposed.

10:18.985 --> 10:21.286
One, two...
five, six.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.988
Looks like we have
ourselves a draw.

10:22.990 --> 10:24.956
Hey, did anybody
not vote?

10:24.958 --> 10:26.925
Me.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.293
I didn't vote.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.894
Come on.
You got mud on your face.

10:29.896 --> 10:31.329
We're a team.

10:31.331 --> 10:32.964
We can rule
this land together.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.333
Mud sister.

10:38.771 --> 10:41.106
No. You're bananas, Mina.

10:41.108 --> 10:42.507
Like the bad kind.

10:42.509 --> 10:43.508
Hey, freedom wins again.

10:43.510 --> 10:46.111
( cheering )

10:46.113 --> 10:48.146
I thought you were
a warrior.

10:48.148 --> 10:51.182
You're just a little girl
living on a stupid
freedom planet.

10:51.184 --> 10:54.119
- You don't even
deserve this.
- Davey!

10:54.121 --> 10:58.323
I wouldn't dare rule over
this looney bin.

10:58.325 --> 11:00.125
- ( siren blaring )
- Attention, citizens.

11:00.127 --> 11:02.360
- We are looking for--
- She's in there.

11:04.597 --> 11:06.197
Uh, there's
nothing inside.

11:06.199 --> 11:07.999
Magic does exist.

11:08.001 --> 11:11.236
I repeat, magic...
does exist.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.205
You were right, Marco.

11:14.207 --> 11:16.841
Mina was a lady
with no marbles.

11:16.843 --> 11:18.376
You wanna go check
behind the French bakery

11:18.378 --> 11:20.278
for some day-old
baguettes?

11:20.280 --> 11:21.980
Of course I do.

11:21.982 --> 11:23.848
Boop.

11:23.850 --> 11:26.418
Mud sister.

11:36.228 --> 11:38.029
- Camping!
- ( screams )

11:38.031 --> 11:40.131
What's up, nature?!

11:40.133 --> 11:42.400
You're gonna get tamed!

11:42.402 --> 11:45.370
( buzzing )

11:45.372 --> 11:48.506
( gasps )
Nature's touching me.

11:48.508 --> 11:50.909
Hey, little guy.

11:50.911 --> 11:52.310
( gasps )

11:52.312 --> 11:54.979
Cataclysmic total extinction
death blast!

11:54.981 --> 11:57.515
Star, we're not on Mewni.

11:57.517 --> 11:59.551
( buzzing )

11:59.553 --> 12:01.386
Nature's nice here.
You'll see.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.388
We'll do some fishing,
a little hiking,

12:03.390 --> 12:06.391
and then... this!

12:06.393 --> 12:07.859
( gasps )

12:07.861 --> 12:09.828
A treasure map?

12:09.830 --> 12:12.030
What? No.
It's Old Youthful.

12:12.032 --> 12:14.232
One of the oldest
geysers on Earth.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.768
- And guess when
it's erupting.
- Today?

12:16.770 --> 12:20.605
Mmmm-hmmmm.

12:20.607 --> 12:22.774
Well, we got
a big day ahead.

12:22.776 --> 12:24.709
Let's get started.

12:24.711 --> 12:26.244
Aren't your parents coming?

12:26.246 --> 12:28.012
Nah. You know how
most parents show

12:28.014 --> 12:30.348
slide shows of
their vacation?
Mine show paintings.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.951
And done. Next.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.021
So it's just
the two of us then?

12:37.023 --> 12:39.090
Yeah. Is that okay?

12:39.092 --> 12:42.427
( explosion )

12:51.971 --> 12:55.440
Camping!!

12:55.442 --> 12:56.941
Dad!

13:02.815 --> 13:05.950
Dad, oh, it's always
great to see you.

13:05.952 --> 13:07.318
But what are you
doing here?

13:07.320 --> 13:09.554
( straining )

13:12.892 --> 13:15.293
What, I can't go camping
with my own daughter?

13:15.295 --> 13:17.262
I taught you how to camp.

13:17.264 --> 13:20.398
Yeah, and now Marco's
showing me how to go
camping here on Earth.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.500
Really? Is he showing you

13:22.502 --> 13:25.837
how to stalk
a Narinthian tar beast

13:25.839 --> 13:29.574
for eleven days
with no food,

13:29.576 --> 13:31.843
no sleep,
and no clothes?!

13:31.845 --> 13:33.978
No, Dad, nature's
really nice here.

13:33.980 --> 13:35.914
Look at what it gave me.

13:35.916 --> 13:38.149
Love bites.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.785
Here, Marco. Show Dad
how to Earth fish.

13:40.787 --> 13:42.187
Yeah, sure.

13:43.455 --> 13:46.357
Whoa. So, how do I...

13:46.359 --> 13:48.459
Amazing. Now what?

13:48.461 --> 13:50.261
You're already doing it.

13:50.263 --> 13:51.830
Yay, Dad!

13:53.165 --> 13:55.767
Now we just sit
and wait.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.775
You wait for the fish
to come to you?

14:03.777 --> 14:06.377
Just relax
and take it all in.

14:07.646 --> 14:08.780
( breathing deeply )

14:08.782 --> 14:11.382
Ah!
Smell that? Okay.

14:11.384 --> 14:12.717
Where'd he go?

14:12.719 --> 14:14.719
Fishing!!

14:14.721 --> 14:17.355
Take that and that.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.624
Is that what fishing
on Mewni looks like?

14:22.394 --> 14:24.529
It says Old Youthful
actually got its name

14:24.531 --> 14:26.331
from early settlers
who believed

14:26.333 --> 14:27.799
that it had
rejuvenating powers.

14:27.801 --> 14:28.833
That sounds really--

14:28.835 --> 14:30.368
Boring!

14:30.370 --> 14:32.370
Why are we walking
so slow?

14:32.372 --> 14:35.006
Well, I was trying
to take it easy,

14:35.008 --> 14:37.375
'cause, you know,
what you did to your foot.

14:38.644 --> 14:40.578
But I don't
even feel it.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.981
Come on, let me
magic you up some boots.

14:42.983 --> 14:44.716
I don't need any of that.

14:44.718 --> 14:46.251
I don't even need feet.

14:46.253 --> 14:47.585
Can you do this, huh?

14:47.587 --> 14:48.753
Can you do this?

14:48.755 --> 14:49.821
I don't think you can.

14:49.823 --> 14:51.422
Want a piggyback
ride, honey?

14:51.424 --> 14:54.158
Aw, Dad. No.

14:54.160 --> 14:56.828
Since when are you
too cool for piggyback rides?

14:56.830 --> 14:59.163
Well, I'm not too cool
for a piggyback--

14:59.165 --> 15:00.498
That would be weird, Marco.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.567
Race you to
the water thing.

15:02.569 --> 15:05.536
( laughing )

15:05.538 --> 15:07.605
- Is that the right way?
- No.

15:07.607 --> 15:10.608
Is your dad okay?

15:10.610 --> 15:12.210
I think so.

15:12.212 --> 15:15.113
He just really loves
family camping trips.

15:15.115 --> 15:17.849
Okay, where'd you go,
big guy?

15:17.851 --> 15:19.050
Got him.

15:19.052 --> 15:20.652
What's he doing
way up there?

15:23.422 --> 15:24.889
Hey, Dad.

15:24.891 --> 15:26.090
Everything all right?

15:26.092 --> 15:28.826
Sh. Staring contest.

15:30.529 --> 15:32.897
Whoa! That's
a bald eagle.

15:32.899 --> 15:35.433
We are breakin'
a whole bunch of laws here.

15:35.435 --> 15:36.567
He started it.

15:36.569 --> 15:38.536
Marco's right, Dad.

15:38.538 --> 15:39.971
Let's go see
Old Youthful.

15:39.973 --> 15:41.539
Don't worry, darling.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.441
Once I break
his spirit with my eyes,

15:43.443 --> 15:44.976
he'll fly us there.

15:44.978 --> 15:47.512
( speaking gibberish )

15:49.048 --> 15:52.717
Llama pajama llama...

15:52.719 --> 15:55.053
pa... ja... ma.

15:56.221 --> 15:58.089
This guy's unbelievable.

15:58.091 --> 16:00.425
You can't let him beat you
in front of your own daughter.

16:00.427 --> 16:02.460
She looks up to you.
Does she though?

16:02.462 --> 16:04.329
What is that
supposed to mean?

16:04.331 --> 16:05.830
Did you notice,
she's pretty much over

16:05.832 --> 16:08.266
your piggyback rides.
She used to love those.

16:08.268 --> 16:09.667
And she went camping
without you.

16:09.669 --> 16:11.569
That Marco kid's
probably her boyfriend.

16:11.571 --> 16:12.937
What? No way.

16:12.939 --> 16:14.939
My little girl
isn't dating yet.

16:14.941 --> 16:17.108
Whatever. Keep lying
to yourself, old man.

16:17.110 --> 16:20.545
- Old? Who are you calling old?
- ( siren blaring )

16:28.087 --> 16:30.655
Something is definitely
goin' on with my dad.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.857
Okay, everything's cool.

16:32.859 --> 16:36.027
Turns out that feathered
thing was some kind of
a sacred animal.

16:36.029 --> 16:37.595
Heads up would've been nice.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.497
You folks better
get a move on

16:39.499 --> 16:41.499
if you wanna see
that old geyser.

16:41.501 --> 16:44.502
Who are you calling
an old geezer?!

16:44.504 --> 16:47.505
Oh. Geyser.

16:47.507 --> 16:52.276
Yes, Dad, the thing Marco's
been trying to see all day.

16:52.278 --> 16:54.278
We can still
make it in time.

16:54.280 --> 16:57.749
This trail should
take us straight...
to it.

16:59.551 --> 17:00.618
Let me see that map.

17:02.388 --> 17:03.554
Is he eating the map?

17:03.556 --> 17:05.323
I was hungry.

17:05.325 --> 17:07.825
Everything is food when you're
struggling to survive.

17:07.827 --> 17:09.460
Except we're not on...

17:09.462 --> 17:11.362
Mewni.

17:11.364 --> 17:12.663
Right. Sorry.

17:12.665 --> 17:14.966
I'm staying
positive about this.

17:14.968 --> 17:17.468
One of those trails
is the right one.

17:17.470 --> 17:18.536
Maybe we'll get lucky.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.738
Eeny, meeny, miney...

17:20.740 --> 17:23.674
Nooooo!

17:23.676 --> 17:25.343
You know what?

17:25.345 --> 17:28.746
I think this may be
my fault.

17:28.748 --> 17:31.182
You kids wait right here
while I score us a ride.

17:31.184 --> 17:33.584
Oh, man, if he could
get us a ride,
that would be...

17:38.590 --> 17:40.691
( groaning )

17:40.693 --> 17:42.894
You'll never make it
to Old Youthful now.

17:42.896 --> 17:45.930
He goes off in five minutes,
and it's a ten-mile hike.

17:45.932 --> 17:48.566
I'm sorry, Marco.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.201
Oh, come on,
what's the big deal?

17:50.203 --> 17:53.037
- Dad, what is up with you?
- Is this about the bear?

17:53.039 --> 17:56.040
No, Dad. You've been
acting really weird all day,

17:56.042 --> 17:58.376
and now, Marco's plans
are basically ruined.

17:58.378 --> 18:00.778
He really wanted to see
Old Youthful.

18:00.780 --> 18:03.581
No, Star, I've seen it,
like, ten times.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.450
I wanted you to see it.

18:05.452 --> 18:07.718
You've shown me
all kind of
amazing stuff

18:07.720 --> 18:09.053
I never knew
existed.

18:09.055 --> 18:11.589
I just wanted
to pay you back.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.891
Show you something
amazing here on Earth.

18:13.893 --> 18:16.527
Marco!

18:16.529 --> 18:18.096
Marco.

18:18.098 --> 18:20.798
I guess we can come back
to see Old Youthful erupt

18:20.800 --> 18:22.633
some other time.

18:22.635 --> 18:24.235
Oh, you poor,
poor boy.

18:24.237 --> 18:26.537
- Didn't nobody tell you?
- What?

18:26.539 --> 18:29.440
This here eruption
is gonna be the last.

18:29.442 --> 18:32.076
- What?!
- Those big-city scientists

18:32.078 --> 18:34.712
gave that geyser a look-see,
and he's all dried up.

18:34.714 --> 18:37.248
He's been fadin' away
for years.

18:37.250 --> 18:38.816
Oh, he used to be
impressive.

18:38.818 --> 18:40.751
King of the geysers.

18:40.753 --> 18:43.488
But now, he's just
a sad shadow of
his former glory.

18:43.490 --> 18:45.656
Aged out
and obsolete.

18:45.658 --> 18:48.292
Ready to retire
and getting in
everybody's way.

18:48.294 --> 18:50.628
Yes, sir, to use
clever wordplay,

18:50.630 --> 18:52.830
Old Youthful
is plumb out of youth.

18:52.832 --> 18:54.899
We should just go.

18:56.902 --> 19:00.404
Yes, Marco.
We will go...

19:00.406 --> 19:03.074
and see that geyser.

19:03.076 --> 19:05.409
Didn't you hear
what that guy said?

19:05.411 --> 19:06.611
It's impossible.

19:06.613 --> 19:07.745
Is it?

19:07.747 --> 19:08.980
Tick-tock.

19:08.982 --> 19:12.617
( slowly )
Tick... tock.

19:12.619 --> 19:13.985
What do you say, Star?

19:13.987 --> 19:16.721
One last piggyback
ride from your old man?

19:52.224 --> 19:53.724
We're almost there!

19:53.726 --> 19:56.460
Just a glacier and two more
war re-enactments.

19:56.462 --> 19:57.695
You hear that, Dad?

19:57.697 --> 19:59.530
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

20:05.704 --> 20:06.971
No!

20:10.709 --> 20:12.076
Dad!

20:12.078 --> 20:14.178
I'm so sorry, pumpkin.

20:14.180 --> 20:15.746
I let you down.

20:15.748 --> 20:17.882
Are you out of your mind?

20:17.884 --> 20:19.717
You ran ten miles
in five minutes.

20:19.719 --> 20:22.353
That's, like,
150 miles an hour.

20:22.355 --> 20:24.855
I used to be able
to do it in four minutes.

20:24.857 --> 20:26.857
I'm not the dad
I used to be, Star.

20:26.859 --> 20:29.660
You need someone younger
to take care of you now.

20:29.662 --> 20:33.097
Someone like...
your boyfriend Marco here.

20:33.099 --> 20:35.032
I'm not her boyfriend.

20:35.034 --> 20:37.735
You fell up a waterfall, dude.
Who does that?

20:37.737 --> 20:41.939
I'm older, too, Dad,
but I still need you.

20:41.941 --> 20:43.941
No matter
how old I get,

20:43.943 --> 20:46.244
you'll always be my hero,

20:46.246 --> 20:48.980
because you'll always
be my dad.

20:50.916 --> 20:52.750
Come here, you.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.020
Well, it's gettin'
chilly out,

20:56.022 --> 20:59.924
so what do you say
we go find you
some pants?

21:01.760 --> 21:04.462
( loud rumbling )

21:10.736 --> 21:13.938
Wow!!

21:13.940 --> 21:17.375
You gotta stop lying
to the tourists
about that geyser, man.

21:17.377 --> 21:19.777
Yeah, I know,
But it sure is fun.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.812
Marco.

21:21.814 --> 21:24.048
It's beautiful.

21:25.050 --> 21:26.951
( loud crash )

21:33.725 --> 21:35.092
Look, Star.

21:35.094 --> 21:38.562
Dad. You're so young.

21:38.564 --> 21:41.098
Yeah. Fresh-out-
the-womb young.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.167
Brand-new dad!

21:43.169 --> 21:44.935
And here's the king
with his arms up.

21:44.937 --> 21:46.570
And here's the king
putting his arms down.

21:46.572 --> 21:48.139
And here he is walking
out of the crater.

21:48.141 --> 21:50.007
And climbing
out of the crater.

21:50.009 --> 21:52.910
This is so much better
than a slide show.
