RAY:
Sit down and think...

01:12.322 --> 01:13.823
...about what...

01:13.991 --> 01:15.450
...you...

01:16.535 --> 01:17.994
...did...

01:20.998 --> 01:22.665
...wrong.

01:25.127 --> 01:27.503
We're always given a choice,
ladies and gentlemen...

01:27.671 --> 01:30.506
...whether to walk the path
of the straight and narrow...

01:30.674 --> 01:33.760
...or to succumb to temptation.

01:33.927 --> 01:37.221
Do I write the essay myself...

01:37.389 --> 01:40.767
...or do I copy it verbatim
from Wikipedia?

01:40.934 --> 01:42.935
Not that bright, Van Olsen.

01:43.103 --> 01:46.189
See these questions, this choice...

01:46.356 --> 01:48.691
...comes down to the core
of who you are.

01:49.485 --> 01:52.695
Detention now
leads to prison later, fellas.

01:52.863 --> 01:56.365
So this time is for sitting down...

01:56.533 --> 02:00.203
...and thinking about
how you got from here...

02:01.705 --> 02:03.539
...to here.

02:04.917 --> 02:07.043
It's about accountability.

02:08.921 --> 02:10.755
It's about responsibility.

02:16.053 --> 02:19.305
Damon Drecker,
can I see you out in the hall, please?

02:20.057 --> 02:21.557
No talking.

02:27.898 --> 02:29.982
What the hell did you do to get detention?

02:30.150 --> 02:31.901
Nothing.

02:33.946 --> 02:38.074
Powell called Mrs. Butchik
"Mrs. Buttcheeks."

02:39.576 --> 02:41.077
Butchik is her given name, son.

02:41.245 --> 02:43.204
- You shouldn't make fun.
- Powell said it.

02:43.372 --> 02:45.331
Who is Powell? This guy?

02:46.041 --> 02:48.501
- Yeah.
- Why are you here?

02:49.711 --> 02:51.003
Just hanging with him.

02:51.171 --> 02:54.048
All right, let me get this straight,
you didn't get detention.

02:54.216 --> 02:58.010
You just decided to spend
the afternoon hanging out...

02:58.178 --> 03:01.138
...in detention with this kid Powell.

03:01.306 --> 03:03.683
Yeah, we're friends.

03:06.979 --> 03:10.857
- What, Dad?
- I don't know. I mean, you know.

03:11.024 --> 03:13.276
- Are you homophobic?
- What are you talking about?

03:13.443 --> 03:17.363
I'm asking you questions about your life.
Come on.

03:17.531 --> 03:20.950
I don't get to see you
that much these days.

03:21.118 --> 03:22.994
Powell's not into labels, Dad.

03:23.161 --> 03:25.621
And quite frankly, neither am I.

03:25.789 --> 03:27.957
Okay, Damester.

03:30.669 --> 03:34.463
RAY: Now I'm not above admitting
George Clooney's a handsome man...

03:34.715 --> 03:38.092
...but this was a whole other thing.

we used to tell each other everything.

03:53.567 --> 03:56.611
- Hello?
TANYA: Hi, Patty.

03:56.778 --> 03:59.196
It's me, Tanya.

04:01.366 --> 04:02.617
Why are you calling me?

04:02.784 --> 04:04.785
I wanted to follow up about your...

04:04.953 --> 04:09.332
...appointment
with the happiness consultant.

04:09.625 --> 04:12.084
I'm working on
the Hollopaw deal right now.

04:12.252 --> 04:15.671
I know. I didn't want to bother you,
but how was it?

04:16.256 --> 04:19.717
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Why not?

04:19.885 --> 04:22.762
Just let it die, okay, Tanya?

04:28.852 --> 04:30.269
Patty, I don't understand.

04:30.437 --> 04:33.356
If by your own assertion
the sex was great...

04:33.523 --> 04:38.694
...then shouldn't you be happy?
- Have you ever done coke, Tanya?

04:39.404 --> 04:41.113
Cocaine?

04:41.865 --> 04:44.325
No. I tried peyote a couple of times.

04:44.493 --> 04:47.036
Well, having sex with that guy
is like doing coke.

04:48.372 --> 04:50.539
Because it's expensive,
but you really want it.

04:50.707 --> 04:54.335
So you buy it and then you get
this huge awesome rush.

04:54.503 --> 04:56.879
That's a good thing, right?
A huge awesome rush.

04:57.047 --> 04:59.882
But then you come down
from your high...

05:00.050 --> 05:03.427
...and you're broke and you feel
even lonelier and more pathetic...

05:03.595 --> 05:06.055
...than you did before
and you want to kill yourself.

05:06.473 --> 05:08.975
So I guess you won't be interested...

05:09.142 --> 05:11.519
...in our bimonthly package?

05:11.687 --> 05:14.355
I'm kidding. Patty, look, wait.

05:14.523 --> 05:18.317
Seriously, what would make you interested
in being a repeat customer?

05:18.485 --> 05:19.694
I don't know.

05:19.861 --> 05:22.488
- Maybe if he was like crack.
- Crack?

05:22.656 --> 05:25.908
Yeah, cheap, dirty.
Same high, half the price.

05:29.287 --> 05:32.081
I think my kid's a gay.

05:33.250 --> 05:35.459
- Damon?
- Yeah.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.254
Well, that's great, Ray.

05:38.422 --> 05:42.049
I mean, don't worry. Lots of kids
experiment with their sexuality.

05:42.217 --> 05:44.385

I don't need to hear about
your lesbian past, Tanya.

We're having a business meeting.
This is business.

05:53.270 --> 05:55.813
All right, well, then I'm gonna
be honest with you, Ray.

05:55.981 --> 06:00.693
We are encountering
a little pushback in our pricing.

06:00.861 --> 06:05.448
I think we might need to consider
lowering our pricing point.

06:05.615 --> 06:07.783

06:28.722 --> 06:30.181
- Where are you?
- Havana, Cuba.

06:30.348 --> 06:32.808
It's a long story.
I'll be back in a few days.
