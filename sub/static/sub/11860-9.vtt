WEBVTT

00:34.125 --> 00:35.208
...and especially
our Browning evidence.

00:35.291 --> 00:36.583
They have nothing to answer it.

00:36.667 --> 00:38.166
Jefferson's trying to
skate by on nice ideas

00:38.250 --> 00:39.417
without a lot of
facts to back them up.

00:39.500 --> 00:40.500
Sorry guys,
but if you want to take

00:40.583 --> 00:41.709
a trophy you got
to do the work.

00:41.792 --> 00:43.208
Extend across
our unanswered DA harms

00:43.291 --> 00:45.291
and we win this round cold.

00:47.208 --> 00:48.250
(male #1)
'Wow.'

00:48.333 --> 00:50.291
Alyssa, you sure talk fast.

00:50.375 --> 00:52.625
You know what they say,
speed kills.

00:52.709 --> 00:54.917
Speed and evidence, right?

00:55.000 --> 00:56.875
How many pages do you
have in your tubs?

00:56.959 --> 01:00.375
Uh, about 20,000. Why?

01:00.458 --> 01:01.625
Did you research that yourself

01:01.709 --> 01:03.875
or copy it at some
overpriced debate camp?

01:04.500 --> 01:06.375
I researched it.

01:06.458 --> 01:08.083
At Dartmouth's
top-rated debate camp.

01:08.166 --> 01:09.625
(male #1)
'Great.'

01:09.709 --> 01:11.959
You keep saying your
Browning
evidence wins the round.

01:12.041 --> 01:14.834
Can you explain it?

01:14.917 --> 01:17.500
Sure.

01:17.583 --> 01:19.333
His article says federal funding

01:19.417 --> 01:22.917
for urban schools is
politically unfeasible.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.417
In his first paragraph

01:24.500 --> 01:26.000
which you take
totally out of
context.

01:26.083 --> 01:29.375
Did you actually
read the whole
article?

01:29.458 --> 01:31.041
And you're
the big expert, why?

01:31.125 --> 01:32.333
'Cause I did.

01:32.417 --> 01:33.667
His conclusion says

01:33.750 --> 01:35.583
"Urban education bills
are risky for Congress

01:35.667 --> 01:38.875
"but the massive benefits
outweigh the political
risks."

01:40.750 --> 01:43.625
Out of a thousand articles
I could have cited

01:43.709 --> 01:46.500
you just happen to
have this one memorized?

01:46.583 --> 01:49.166
Can't afford 20,000 photocopies.

01:49.250 --> 01:51.166
Got to use this instead.

01:56.417 --> 01:59.208
(Darren)
'Hey, Luke, Coach Darren Musk,
Maynard Green.'

01:59.291 --> 02:01.458
Now that was a great debate.

02:01.542 --> 02:03.458
You actually
memorized the Browning?

02:03.542 --> 02:05.667
Don't have Dartmouth.
Just my brain.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.375
I saw a bunch of
your rounds last
year

02:07.458 --> 02:11.000
and the way you retain info,
how the hell do you do that?

02:11.083 --> 02:13.208
I always just kind
of remembered things.

02:13.291 --> 02:15.375
I mean, you've been
mopping up the Philly
circuit.

02:15.458 --> 02:19.000
Did you ever wonder how
you'd
do at national tournaments?

02:19.083 --> 02:20.417
Harvard?
Berkeley?

02:20.500 --> 02:22.000
Long bus ride to Berkeley.

02:22.083 --> 02:24.709
Right, yeah, I mean, you
can't
compete without resources.

02:24.792 --> 02:27.500
You gotta have travel
budget,
computers, photocopies--

02:27.583 --> 02:29.125
Beat your team
without any of that.

02:29.208 --> 02:31.959
Sure, but imagine what
you could do with it.

02:32.041 --> 02:34.709
National
tournaments,
college recruiters.

02:34.792 --> 02:37.542
Would you ever consider
debating for Maynard Green?

02:38.959 --> 02:40.458
What are you talking about?

02:40.542 --> 02:41.917
I couldn't even
afford the jacket.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.500
You wouldn't have to.

02:43.583 --> 02:45.291
I'm offering you
a full
scholarship.

02:45.375 --> 02:47.375
Blazer included.

02:47.458 --> 02:48.834
A debate scholarship.

02:48.917 --> 02:50.959
That could be your
best shot at going to
college.

02:51.041 --> 02:53.750
What about Ronnie?

02:53.834 --> 02:57.166
Sorry, but travel
budget's for one.

02:57.250 --> 03:00.542
I made it to
college finals in
'87.

03:00.625 --> 03:03.917
There is no thrill like
competing at that level.

03:06.333 --> 03:08.166
If I say yes..

03:08.250 --> 03:10.041
...I got to wear
the stupid jacket?

03:55.583 --> 03:57.291
(Rush)
'Keith?'

03:57.375 --> 03:58.959
I'm Detective Rush.

03:59.041 --> 04:00.500
Uh, sorry, I don't..

04:00.583 --> 04:01.959
It's flu season.

04:02.041 --> 04:04.125
You can't be too careful, right?

04:04.208 --> 04:06.625
- What can I do for you?
- I'm not really sure.

04:06.709 --> 04:09.291
Uh, see, I'm on the debate
team at Maynard Green.

04:09.375 --> 04:10.792
And they don't
teach eye
contact?

04:10.875 --> 04:13.083
Oh. Oh, sorry. Sorry.

04:13.166 --> 04:16.041
Anyway, um, there
was this debater we had.

04:16.125 --> 04:17.500
Ever heard of Luke Cronin?

04:17.583 --> 04:20.083
Stopped following
high school debate a while
back.

04:20.166 --> 04:21.417
I mean, he's kind of a legend.

04:21.500 --> 04:23.542
He won every tournament
except his last

04:23.625 --> 04:26.166
and shot himself
the night he lost.

04:26.250 --> 04:28.250
- Oh, when was this?
- 1999.

04:28.333 --> 04:30.500
He was only at
Maynard three months.

04:30.583 --> 04:32.125
Real Sallie Mae kid, apparently.

04:32.208 --> 04:34.583
- Sallie Mae?
- Couldn't afford Maynard.

04:34.667 --> 04:36.959
Only there 'cause of
a debate scholarship.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.583
You wanna tell me
why you're here?

04:42.667 --> 04:44.417
We keep files from way back.

04:44.500 --> 04:47.583
So I've been going through
some of Luke's old tubs

04:47.667 --> 04:49.917
trying to learn from him and..

04:52.333 --> 04:54.542
This is the last case
that Luke ever used.

04:54.625 --> 04:57.208
And I found
something on the back.

04:57.291 --> 04:58.375
What am I looking at here?

04:58.458 --> 04:59.625
It's debate shorthand.

04:59.709 --> 05:01.583
Our speeches are timed,
so we talk fast

05:01.667 --> 05:02.709
400 words a minute

05:02.792 --> 05:04.625
and shorthand's
the only way to keep up.

05:04.709 --> 05:06.208
And what does
this shorthand
say?

05:06.291 --> 05:08.291
I'm not sure
what the small symbols mean

05:08.375 --> 05:09.875
but these..

05:09.959 --> 05:11.458
"I'm going to stop you.

05:11.542 --> 05:13.250
I'm going to kill you."

05:13.333 --> 05:14.750
A threat letter.

05:14.834 --> 05:17.542
Dated December 19, 1999.

05:17.625 --> 05:18.750
It's the same night that Luke--

05:18.834 --> 05:20.917
Supposedly shot himself.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.709
Don't waste
your time or anything

05:22.792 --> 05:27.709
but...suicide's a big
legacy to leave behind.

05:27.792 --> 05:29.375
If there was something else..

05:32.125 --> 05:34.792
Then we need to set
the record straight.

06:09.458 --> 06:10.750
Back in '99, Luke was
under a lot of
pressure

06:10.834 --> 06:13.291
grades, SATs, debate team.

06:13.375 --> 06:16.125
ME said self-inflicted
gunshot to the head.

06:16.208 --> 06:18.792
Trajectory and gunpowder
residue indicated suicide.

06:18.875 --> 06:21.709
No reason to think foul
play
till a threat letter
shows up.

06:21.792 --> 06:24.000
Local coaches backed up
Keith's translation.

06:24.083 --> 06:25.750
I took a closer
look at the wound.

06:25.834 --> 06:28.166
There's a star pattern
at the point of entry.

06:28.250 --> 06:29.875
Gun was pressed
right against his head.

06:29.959 --> 06:31.208
Nine out of ten suicides

06:31.291 --> 06:32.959
they pull the gun
back
at the last second.

06:33.041 --> 06:35.959
Either our debate geek
had some serious stones..

06:36.041 --> 06:37.875
Or someone made
good on that
threat.

06:37.959 --> 06:40.250
Body was found in
the Maynard parking
lot

06:40.333 --> 06:42.959
driver's seat of his
father's car at 6:00
A.M.

06:43.041 --> 06:45.125
Estimated time of
death's around midnight.

06:45.208 --> 06:47.333
.38 Taurus found
in his right hand.

06:47.417 --> 06:49.417
Oh, get one of those
on any street corner.

06:49.500 --> 06:50.959
Well, it's not
registered in Pennsylvania.

06:51.041 --> 06:53.000
It's before
the Patriot Act, dead end.

06:53.083 --> 06:54.750
Assigned could
only track it so far.

06:54.834 --> 06:56.750
Well, run it with
the ATF, see what comes
up.

06:56.834 --> 06:58.250
Luke have a record?

06:58.333 --> 06:59.750
(Rush)
'A few problems
at Jefferson High.'

06:59.834 --> 07:01.667
Suspended for stealing books.

07:01.750 --> 07:03.333
But he cleaned up at Maynard.

07:03.417 --> 07:05.250
You don't have to steal
when you have everything.

07:05.333 --> 07:07.375
I used to play
baseball against 'em.

07:07.458 --> 07:09.375
Had new equipment every year

07:09.458 --> 07:10.500
still sucked.

07:10.583 --> 07:12.125
That coach from '99,
he still around?

07:12.208 --> 07:14.750
He still has the same job.
We're heading over later.

07:14.834 --> 07:17.625
Luke was at the Pembrook
debate tournament day he
died.

07:17.709 --> 07:19.375
Threat might have been
slipped to him there.

07:19.458 --> 07:20.834
Any family in the picture?

07:20.917 --> 07:22.333
Might know if Luke
was having problems.

07:22.417 --> 07:25.041
Father's still up in Oak Lane.
There's no other relatives.

07:25.125 --> 07:26.750
Nick and Will are
talking to him now.

07:31.166 --> 07:33.250
Spent ten years thinking
my son killed himself

07:33.333 --> 07:35.834
and now you're telling me
it was someone else?

07:35.917 --> 07:38.333
Said you were in
the VA Hospital night he died?

07:38.417 --> 07:40.500
Polytrauma,
back injury from the Gulf.

07:40.583 --> 07:42.750
Said you had no idea
where Luke got the
pistol?

07:42.834 --> 07:45.917
I learned in the war,
no good comes from a gun.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.375
I taught Luke the same.

07:47.458 --> 07:49.709
Luke having problems
with anyone at Maynard?

07:49.792 --> 07:50.875
Whole another world there.

07:50.959 --> 07:53.583
If he was,
he didn't tell me about it.

07:53.667 --> 07:55.000
I hardly spoke to him
those three months

07:55.083 --> 07:56.333
after he switched schools.

07:56.417 --> 07:57.750
He having trouble adjusting?

07:57.834 --> 07:58.959
Workload was tough

07:59.041 --> 08:00.625
even for him.

08:00.709 --> 08:02.041
We pro/con'd it.

08:02.125 --> 08:03.875
Thought it'd give him
opportunities I never
had.

08:03.959 --> 08:05.709
- Pro/con'd?
- Pros and cons list.

08:05.792 --> 08:07.375
I taught 'em to
Luke when he was
five.

08:07.458 --> 08:08.375
Smart kid.

08:08.458 --> 08:10.041
Our brains worked the same way.

08:10.125 --> 08:12.291
No off switch.

08:12.375 --> 08:14.208
I thought Luke had found
a good outlet for it.

08:14.291 --> 08:15.834
Spending time
with
the debate team?

08:15.917 --> 08:18.834
Debate was the only
thing
that challenged him.

08:18.917 --> 08:22.792
Took him away from me,
even before he died.

08:29.083 --> 08:30.667
Said you'd be gone
a couple hours.

08:31.792 --> 08:32.750
You missed the whole game.

08:34.250 --> 08:37.125
I had to read 2,000
pages of evidence.

08:37.208 --> 08:39.333
And the train was late.

08:40.667 --> 08:42.583
Since when do you need
all this evidence to win?

08:42.667 --> 08:46.041
I'm about to debate
the best teams in the
country.

08:46.125 --> 08:48.750
Got to keep up,
prove I deserve
it.

08:48.834 --> 08:50.083
Prove it, hell.

08:51.500 --> 08:53.709
You're smart as any
of those Maynard la-di-da's.

08:53.792 --> 08:56.542
No one wants me
on the team, dad.

08:56.625 --> 09:00.458
Smart or not,
I'm still from Oak Lane.

09:02.333 --> 09:06.291
You ain't gonna prove nothing,
working yourself to death.

09:06.375 --> 09:07.458
You even eat?

09:07.542 --> 09:10.417
Darren brought us...sushi.

09:10.500 --> 09:11.417
Sushi?

09:11.500 --> 09:13.500
Ain't really food.

09:13.583 --> 09:16.166
You want me to
fry up some scrapple?

09:16.250 --> 09:19.458
No, I got to
start my homework.

09:20.709 --> 09:21.625
Luke?

09:25.291 --> 09:28.375
Only one who can judge you..

09:28.458 --> 09:30.125
...is you.

09:31.667 --> 09:34.583
Well, I'm a pretty tough critic.

09:34.667 --> 09:37.375
Guess I'm screwed.

09:42.125 --> 09:45.500
That's the problem
with a genius son.

09:45.583 --> 09:47.125
You never win an argument.

09:47.208 --> 09:48.917
(Vera)
'Luke said they didn't
want him on the team.'

09:49.000 --> 09:50.709
He talking about
anyone in
particular?

09:50.792 --> 09:51.709
Don't know.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.375
That was our
longest conversation

09:53.458 --> 09:54.458
in three months.

09:54.542 --> 09:56.375
You ever meet this Coach Darren?

09:56.458 --> 10:00.125
No. I tried to
stay out of Luke's
way.

10:00.208 --> 10:02.250
Just figured I'd embarrass him.

10:04.166 --> 10:06.250
You think of anything else..

10:07.291 --> 10:10.500
I'm thinking only one thing.

10:10.583 --> 10:13.166
Find the son of a
bitch
who did this.

10:24.709 --> 10:27.542
Now, says here you have
only four drinks a week?

10:27.625 --> 10:30.083
Is that true?

10:30.166 --> 10:32.125
Give or take.

10:32.208 --> 10:33.583
Ever have hepatitis?

10:33.667 --> 10:35.125
What the hell are
you talking about?

10:36.667 --> 10:38.208
No.

10:38.291 --> 10:41.125
Nick, you have any idea
what liver failure looks like?

10:42.083 --> 10:43.667
It isn't pretty.

10:45.125 --> 10:46.250
I'll take your word for it.

10:46.333 --> 10:47.875
You need to stop drinkin'.

10:47.959 --> 10:49.250
You need to start
eating right too.

10:49.333 --> 10:51.375
Exercising more.

10:51.458 --> 10:52.500
Been hearing that for years.

10:52.583 --> 10:54.166
Yeah, well,
it's catching up to you.

10:54.250 --> 10:55.583
You ever hear
of good cholesterol?

10:55.667 --> 10:57.667
- Yeah.
- You got none of that.

10:57.750 --> 10:59.875
Bad cholesterol, you got lots.

10:59.959 --> 11:01.750
Your long-term
outlook is not good.

11:01.834 --> 11:04.834
Well, I can still bench
250
and chase down a bad guy.

11:04.917 --> 11:06.000
You put that in there?

11:06.083 --> 11:07.542
Nick, this isn't a joke.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.542
You need to make
lifestyle changes..

11:09.625 --> 11:11.041
...today.

11:12.500 --> 11:15.667
Are you sending
that
to the department?

11:15.750 --> 11:17.625
Soon as you sign this release.

11:30.208 --> 11:31.417
I don't know.

11:31.500 --> 11:33.166
Um, any debater
could have written it.

11:33.250 --> 11:34.166
Standard shorthand.

11:34.250 --> 11:35.875
What about the smaller symbols?

11:35.959 --> 11:37.041
I've never seen these.

11:37.125 --> 11:39.083
I mean, some debaters
develop their own.

11:39.166 --> 11:40.750
They're always searching
for a faster system.

11:40.834 --> 11:43.625
The threat was in
Luke's evidence
tub.

11:43.709 --> 11:44.834
You know who had access?

11:44.917 --> 11:46.834
Anyone who was at
the Pembrook tournament.

11:46.917 --> 11:47.917
My whole squad was there

11:48.000 --> 11:50.083
and lot of other
debate teams too.

11:50.166 --> 11:52.291
You remember what you did
after the tournament?

11:52.375 --> 11:53.417
Took the team to dinner.

11:53.500 --> 11:54.625
And then everyone went home.

11:54.709 --> 11:56.250
Luke come out with
the team that
night?

11:56.333 --> 11:58.083
No, he left
after his last round.

11:58.166 --> 11:59.583
Oh, the neighborhood
Luke grew up in

11:59.667 --> 12:02.041
he have a tough time
making friends around
here?

12:02.125 --> 12:04.959
Yeah, but not for
the reasons you're thinking.

12:05.041 --> 12:07.709
His ability to memorize

12:07.792 --> 12:11.625
and apply information,
figures, articles, I mean..

12:11.709 --> 12:13.166
...I'd never
seen anything like it.

12:13.250 --> 12:16.458
Rub his teammates the wrong way,
this "ability" of his?

12:16.542 --> 12:18.750
He was our top
debater in two weeks.

12:18.834 --> 12:20.458
I thought I was giving him
a chance to shine

12:20.542 --> 12:23.250
but...maybe I put
a target on his back.

12:24.834 --> 12:26.458
The counterplan just
got cut off at the knees.

12:26.542 --> 12:28.208
They're trying to grab onto us
with their generic economy
links

12:28.291 --> 12:29.750
but there's nothing to refute
that we lower state deficits

12:29.834 --> 12:31.250
allowing a payback on
all federal spending.

12:31.333 --> 12:32.834
What they don't realize,
our plan is bulletproof.

12:32.917 --> 12:34.333
It's Teflon and it improves
every school in America.

12:34.417 --> 12:36.375
We have won, let's go home.

12:37.583 --> 12:40.959
Nice speech.
Who's cross-examining?

12:41.917 --> 12:43.083
Bring that on!

12:43.166 --> 12:45.917
Anyone got a question
for "the" Oliver?

12:51.792 --> 12:53.875
I have a question.

12:53.959 --> 12:55.500
(Oliver)
'Alright, Sallie Mae.'

12:55.583 --> 12:58.834
Show me what we get for
15,000 in scholarship funds.

12:58.917 --> 13:01.166
Why would anybody
vote for your plan?

13:01.250 --> 13:04.208
- When it's already happened?
- What are you talking about?

13:04.291 --> 13:06.834
Lieberman sent an identical
bill to the Senate yesterday.

13:06.917 --> 13:10.208
It's a good idea,
but it's already been done.

13:10.291 --> 13:11.417
I didn't hear about that.

13:11.500 --> 13:13.709
'Because you
weren't here
working.'

13:13.792 --> 13:16.041
Luke researched
until midnight last
night.

13:16.125 --> 13:19.875
- I had an interview with
Brown.
- What wins debates, Oliver?

13:19.959 --> 13:21.291
Evidence wins debates.

13:21.375 --> 13:24.875
Luke cut a thousand
pages
of evidence last week.

13:24.959 --> 13:27.834
Now I made it to National
Finals
in '87 because of hard work.

13:27.917 --> 13:30.417
And you lost it because
your partner slacked off.

13:30.500 --> 13:31.667
That's right.

13:31.750 --> 13:35.166
Next week, Luke's A-Team
with you, Alyssa.

13:35.250 --> 13:38.375
If he agrees to wear the blazer.

13:38.458 --> 13:40.500
Alright.

13:42.583 --> 13:43.792
It's a good thing
coach wants you here

13:43.875 --> 13:45.375
because nobody else does.

13:51.792 --> 13:55.250
Hard decision,
but Luke and Alyssa..

13:55.333 --> 13:58.250
...became the best team
I ever coached.

13:58.333 --> 14:01.125
Now who's this kid
Luke knocked off the A-Team?

14:01.208 --> 14:03.834
Oliver Calhoun.
Decent debater.

14:03.917 --> 14:05.875
Did he get his spot
back,
once Luke died?

14:05.959 --> 14:08.875
Rode it straight to the FTA,
for all the good it did him.

14:08.959 --> 14:12.250
Kid lost quick. He was
never gonna be Luke Cronin.

14:19.834 --> 14:21.166
Last of Luke's tubs.

14:21.250 --> 14:23.000
I carried 'em.
So guess what?

14:23.083 --> 14:24.375
I ain't going through 'em.

14:24.458 --> 14:26.750
Well, don't hurt yourself.

14:26.834 --> 14:28.125
- 'Hey, Nick.'
- 'Yeah?'

14:28.208 --> 14:31.458
Still need that
medical paperwork from you.

14:31.542 --> 14:33.709
Doctor was sick,
can you believe
it?

14:33.792 --> 14:34.917
Got another
appointment for
tomorrow.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.709
- End of the week.
- 'Yeah.'

14:36.792 --> 14:39.333
- Someone's afraid of needles.
- What do you got?

14:39.417 --> 14:42.417
Well, partner Alyssa's
digging ditches in
Paraguay.

14:42.500 --> 14:44.458
Out of contact,
missed a return
flight

14:44.542 --> 14:45.959
nobody knows when she's back.

14:46.041 --> 14:48.500
What about that,
uh, Oliver Calhoun?

14:48.583 --> 14:51.291
Record's shiny,
so I checked criminal records.

14:51.375 --> 14:55.917
Turns out he's got a stack of
arrest cards up in Providence.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.750
- All expunged.
- 'Three DUIs.'

14:58.834 --> 15:00.333
Cocaine possession.

15:00.417 --> 15:02.959
Solicitation of a
prostitute.
Twice.

15:03.041 --> 15:04.583
And that's just
freshman year at
Brown.

15:04.667 --> 15:07.125
Senior year,
he had an unregistered .38

15:07.208 --> 15:08.250
in his frat house.

15:08.333 --> 15:10.291
Same caliber that killed Luke.

15:10.375 --> 15:11.709
How'd he get
the record expunged?

15:11.792 --> 15:13.458
Daddy's a partner at
Delfino and Calhoun

15:13.542 --> 15:16.375
where Oliver's
a second year lawyer today.

15:16.458 --> 15:19.166
Get away with enough, you start
to think there are no rules.

15:19.250 --> 15:22.458
Like to see his daddy
try to expunge this.

15:31.417 --> 15:32.542
Oliver Calhoun?

15:32.625 --> 15:34.333
That's what it says on the door.

15:34.417 --> 15:36.291
Need to ask you some
questions, wiseass.

15:36.375 --> 15:37.875
Ask away, Detective Grumpy.

15:37.959 --> 15:39.917
Oh, let me guess.
Detective Bashful?

15:40.000 --> 15:43.000
Not so bashful when I bash
your head against my car
door.

15:43.083 --> 15:46.625
Easy, chief. We're on the same
team here. Law and order.

15:46.709 --> 15:48.959
Except we put dirtbags
away,
you get 'em off.

15:49.041 --> 15:50.250
Yourself included.

15:50.333 --> 15:52.500
Six arrests
disappear off your record

15:52.583 --> 15:54.917
like magic.

16:00.792 --> 16:02.083
How'd you find out about that?

16:02.166 --> 16:04.625
Mm, pretty handy with
an unregistered .38.

16:04.709 --> 16:06.875
(Vera)
'How does a sweet kid
from Brown get one of those?'

16:06.959 --> 16:10.625
My roommate was Greek.
Got all the good stuff.

16:10.709 --> 16:13.291
We shot through a few
phone books. So what?

16:13.375 --> 16:15.917
Same kinda gun shot
through Luke Cronin's
head.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.709
Luke Cronin?

16:17.792 --> 16:19.375
That's why you're here?

16:19.458 --> 16:21.208
Guy shot himself
like ten years ago.

16:21.291 --> 16:22.750
Worked out pretty good for you.

16:22.834 --> 16:24.250
Got your spot on the team back.

16:24.333 --> 16:26.250
Hit up the Forensics
Tournament of America.

16:26.333 --> 16:29.542
Fellas...we may have
had problems at first

16:29.625 --> 16:30.709
but Luke..

16:30.792 --> 16:33.875
...he turned into
the life of the party.

16:33.959 --> 16:35.208
And I love to party.

16:37.709 --> 16:41.208
I dedicate this trophy to
Dartmouth admissions

16:41.291 --> 16:44.834
and partner Luke who's way
smarter than that last guy.

16:44.917 --> 16:46.041
You know what?

16:46.125 --> 16:48.250
You guys aren't half bad
after five of these.

16:48.333 --> 16:51.542
- 'Oh!'
- Less talky, more drinky.

17:06.250 --> 17:08.792
What's wrong?
Too much drinky?

17:10.583 --> 17:13.750
Only reason we won is beat
'em
to death with evidence.

17:13.834 --> 17:15.583
I didn't say
one word of my own
today.

17:15.667 --> 17:17.125
When you graduate from Harvard

17:17.208 --> 17:19.500
it won't seem
like such a bad thing.

17:19.583 --> 17:21.583
Is that the only
reason
you're doing this?

17:21.667 --> 17:24.667
Someday I'm going to help
the world. Environmental law.

17:24.750 --> 17:27.542
And going Ivy is
the best way to get heard.

17:27.625 --> 17:29.125
You got the silver
spoon
advantage.

17:29.208 --> 17:31.125
You're going Ivy no matter what.

17:31.208 --> 17:34.125
You just think that my life
is so easy, don't you?

17:34.208 --> 17:36.792
Hey, Sallie.
Gotta show you somethin' funny.

17:46.709 --> 17:49.041
That's...our old tub.

17:49.125 --> 17:50.458
That's Ronnie's tub.
You stole it?

17:50.542 --> 17:51.959
He left it in
the tourney
lounge.

17:52.041 --> 17:54.166
He must be going
crazy looking for
it.

17:54.250 --> 17:56.458
Can't wait to see his face.

17:56.542 --> 17:58.333
(Ronnie)
'Hey, this the Maynard
party?'

18:00.375 --> 18:02.750
Any of you all seen my tubs?

18:02.834 --> 18:05.166
(Luke)
'Ronnie!'

18:05.250 --> 18:07.417
Ronnie, you're won't
believe what
happened.

18:12.041 --> 18:14.041
- 'Oh!'
- 'Whoa!'

18:14.125 --> 18:15.333
Congrats on the win.

18:15.417 --> 18:17.875
Think I'll go back
to the Motel Six now.

18:33.250 --> 18:35.500
We all have our own way
to blow off steam, right?

18:35.583 --> 18:38.000
Those were some great parties.
Never forget 'em.

18:38.083 --> 18:40.667
Sounds like Ronnie wasn't
in
a forgetting mood, either.

18:40.750 --> 18:42.333
You wanna make an omelet,
you gotta crack a few

18:42.417 --> 18:44.709
Malcolm-X-quoting eggs.

18:47.125 --> 18:49.208
Kid was one of those
revolutionary types.

18:49.291 --> 18:52.041
- Always pissed off at
somebody.
- What about you?

18:52.125 --> 18:54.750
After December 1st, I couldn't
have cared less about debate.

18:54.834 --> 18:58.625
- What happened December 1st?
- I got accepted at Brown.

18:58.709 --> 19:01.250
Debate was the means,
that was the end.

19:01.333 --> 19:03.208
Oh, you didn't
care about the FTA?

19:03.291 --> 19:05.792
Check my judging
ballots, fellas.

19:05.875 --> 19:08.542
I was hung over,
lost every round.

19:08.625 --> 19:10.709
I mean seriously,
do I sound like a guy

19:10.792 --> 19:12.709
who would kill to win?

19:16.000 --> 19:19.208
August 23rd, night the Phils
won
the game on that triple play

19:19.291 --> 19:21.625
you see this woman
in the parking lot?

19:21.709 --> 19:24.375
Your manager called
it an "incident."

19:25.333 --> 19:27.709
I think that was her. Yeah.

19:27.792 --> 19:30.208
What kinda
incident
we talkin' about?

19:30.291 --> 19:32.750
Saw her on the ground,
that's all.

19:32.834 --> 19:34.166
What do you mean,
on the ground?

19:34.250 --> 19:36.250
I came out,
saw her gettin' up.

19:36.333 --> 19:38.625
Looked 'cross the lot, see
some guy running away from her.

19:38.709 --> 19:41.250
What do you mean, some guy?
What, he knocked her down?

19:41.333 --> 19:42.291
- What guy?
- I don't know.

19:42.375 --> 19:43.417
I said what guy?

19:43.500 --> 19:45.375
Was he white, black,
you seen him before?

19:45.458 --> 19:47.208
- What?
- I didn't see his face.

19:47.291 --> 19:50.208
His baseball hat was real low.

19:50.291 --> 19:51.458
Show me where they were.

19:51.542 --> 19:53.333
Exactly.

19:54.959 --> 19:57.375
Now I asked if she
wanted help, swear to
God.

19:57.458 --> 19:59.583
Said she was fine, drove off.

19:59.667 --> 20:01.417
Drove off in what?

20:01.500 --> 20:03.959
Blue Cobalt with a Jesus fish.

20:06.333 --> 20:09.792
She said she was fine,
she still have her purse?

20:09.875 --> 20:12.125
I don't know. Guess so.

20:12.208 --> 20:13.583
I don't really remember.

20:13.667 --> 20:15.375
And you didn't think you
should
report this to the police?

20:15.458 --> 20:18.041
Man, told you,
she said she was
fine.

20:25.291 --> 20:28.291
So...am I done here?

20:28.375 --> 20:30.709
Yeah. You're done.

20:33.291 --> 20:34.583
(male #2)
'Whoo, check it out!'

20:34.667 --> 20:36.959
'Coach is talking
to the white lady.'

20:37.041 --> 20:39.041
'Hey, come on, coach.'

20:39.125 --> 20:41.250
Might be debate team,
but you still gotta keep an
eye.

20:41.333 --> 20:44.125
I need to ask a few
questions
about Luke Cronin.

20:44.208 --> 20:45.291
Wow.

20:45.375 --> 20:47.208
Haven't heard that
name in a long time.

20:47.291 --> 20:48.750
You two close?

20:48.834 --> 20:51.166
He was my best friend.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.500
You ever seen these?

20:54.917 --> 20:56.417
No.

20:56.500 --> 20:58.333
Can't read 'em. Different
than standard shorthand.

20:58.417 --> 21:00.917
But you saw Luke at
the Pembrook tournament?

21:01.000 --> 21:02.250
Night he died. Yeah.

21:02.333 --> 21:04.709
We were both
too busy to say hey.

21:04.792 --> 21:06.333
You ever own a handgun, Ronnie?

21:07.792 --> 21:09.208
No.

21:09.291 --> 21:11.834
But if it might've been murder,
let's start with the black man.

21:11.917 --> 21:13.166
I didn't start here.

21:13.250 --> 21:14.500
But now I'm wondering
why two best friends

21:14.583 --> 21:17.375
were too busy to say hey.

21:17.458 --> 21:19.875
We were going through
a rough patch the night he,
uh..

21:19.959 --> 21:21.291
Was murdered.

21:21.375 --> 21:23.458
You always punch your way
through rough patches?

21:23.542 --> 21:26.000
Look, I regret the hell out
of that, but I didn't hurt
Luke.

21:26.083 --> 21:27.667
Must've been jealous,
him getting the
scholarship

21:27.750 --> 21:28.667
instead of you.

21:28.750 --> 21:29.625
Are you kiddin' me?

21:29.709 --> 21:30.667
I wouldn't touch Maynard Green

21:30.750 --> 21:31.834
with a hundred-foot pole.

21:31.917 --> 21:33.583
So why do Maynard security logs

21:33.667 --> 21:37.250
show you trespassing two days
before Luke was killed there?

21:38.959 --> 21:41.083
I'm asking you a question.

21:41.166 --> 21:42.625
- Answer it.
- Or what?

21:42.709 --> 21:45.667
Kids see you cuffed. You answer
it downtown instead.

21:47.333 --> 21:48.375
Maynard was like quicksand.

21:48.458 --> 21:50.458
I was trying to pull Luke out.

21:52.291 --> 21:53.542
(Ronnie)
Hey, Luke.

21:53.625 --> 21:54.917
'Wait up!'

21:57.458 --> 21:59.041
What the hell
you doing here, Ronnie?

21:59.125 --> 22:01.583
You know, I got to drop
the apology bomb, man.

22:01.667 --> 22:02.542
You're never home, so..

22:02.625 --> 22:04.709
For what, that schoolgirl punch?

22:04.792 --> 22:05.834
Yeah.

22:06.583 --> 22:08.875
So...we cool?

22:08.959 --> 22:11.583
We're cool.

22:11.667 --> 22:14.583
- Look, I gotta get to
class.
- Wait a second.

22:15.625 --> 22:18.625
- You high?
- What?

22:18.709 --> 22:20.834
No.

22:25.333 --> 22:27.417
Dextroamphetamine?

22:27.500 --> 22:28.959
No, you ain't high, Luke.

22:29.041 --> 22:30.625
I only use 'em before
tournaments to stay awake.

22:30.709 --> 22:33.625
Man, we used to bust on
those Maynard speed
freaks.

22:33.709 --> 22:35.709
Give 'em back.

22:35.792 --> 22:38.417
Dr. Melanie Banks.

22:38.500 --> 22:40.625
You got the main line
connection now, huh?

22:40.709 --> 22:41.917
Anything to give
you an edge,
right?

22:42.000 --> 22:43.792
I said give 'em back.

22:43.875 --> 22:46.375
I got debate every night,
got to travel every weekend.

22:46.458 --> 22:48.583
Got to keep up my GPA
for the scholarship.

22:48.667 --> 22:50.458
You making excuses now?

22:50.542 --> 22:53.917
'Cause that doctor should be
shot for even giving you
those.

22:55.083 --> 22:58.375
Come on, Luke, it's me, man.

22:58.458 --> 23:00.625
It's my problem.

23:00.709 --> 23:02.917
Let me fix it, alright?

23:03.000 --> 23:06.333
(male #3)
'Come with me, son.'

23:06.417 --> 23:09.417
Oh, no, black man on campus.

23:09.500 --> 23:10.792
Got to get the cuffs.

23:10.875 --> 23:13.458
Son, I told you,
you cannot come on campus

23:13.542 --> 23:14.792
'without an ID badge.'

23:17.291 --> 23:18.792
I'd never seen Luke like that.

23:18.875 --> 23:20.250
The drugs weren't
a long-term thing?

23:20.333 --> 23:21.542
No way.

23:21.625 --> 23:24.208
His dad was on whiskey
and painkillers for his back.

23:24.291 --> 23:26.500
Before Maynard,
Luke wouldn't sip a beer.

23:26.583 --> 23:28.458
Why didn't you come
forward after Luke
died?

23:28.542 --> 23:31.333
To say what?
Cops said it was suicide.

23:31.417 --> 23:33.583
His dad was already a wreck.
I wasn't much better.

23:33.667 --> 23:35.667
What about that doctor
prescribing the pills?

23:35.750 --> 23:38.583
I don't know. That was
the last time I saw him.

23:38.667 --> 23:41.208
Maybe he tried to fix
that problem after all.

23:43.083 --> 23:44.959
Anything off
Luke's debate
notes?

23:45.041 --> 23:47.542
I've been pounding
my head against the wall.

23:47.625 --> 23:50.834
- Still got nothing.
- That's a lot of nothing.

23:50.917 --> 23:52.583
Everything Luke
wrote the day he
died.

23:52.667 --> 23:54.917
I called every coach in town

23:55.000 --> 23:56.792
still can't
translate half of
it.

23:56.875 --> 23:59.500
Some of this
shorthand,
nobody knows.

23:59.583 --> 24:01.500
What about the symbols
from the threat letter?

24:01.583 --> 24:03.709
I matched 'em but
I can't translate
'em.

24:03.792 --> 24:06.667
Now Luke used a couple
of them here and here.

24:06.750 --> 24:08.041
Oh, Luke knew that code.

24:08.125 --> 24:11.000
Hmm.
Question is, Who else
did?

24:11.083 --> 24:12.542
(Jeffries)
'Found Melanie Banks.'

24:12.625 --> 24:14.792
Psychiatrist
practicing in
Colorado

24:14.875 --> 24:17.917
but in '99 she was
married to Coach
Darren.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.500
Was she writing the
team prescriptions?

24:19.583 --> 24:23.000
No, her husband was.
Stole her prescription
pad.

24:23.083 --> 24:24.000
'Gets better.'

24:24.083 --> 24:25.375
She remembers Luke showing up

24:25.458 --> 24:28.875
at their apartment
two days before he
died.

24:28.959 --> 24:30.208
Those drugs get out in the open

24:30.291 --> 24:32.667
Darren loses his job
and he's looking at jail time.

24:32.750 --> 24:35.834
Some people will do
anything
to keep a secret.

24:43.208 --> 24:44.291
Hey, coach..

24:44.375 --> 24:46.083
...these night
shifts are killing
me.

24:46.166 --> 24:47.542
Got anything to help?

24:47.625 --> 24:50.250
Think some dextroamphetamines
might do the trick?

24:52.083 --> 24:54.291
Okay, okay, look,
you should know

24:54.375 --> 24:56.250
that my ex-wife had
nothing to do with that.

24:56.333 --> 24:59.000
I took a few slips
from her prescription pad

24:59.083 --> 25:00.208
to help Luke out.

25:00.291 --> 25:01.375
By giving him speed?

25:01.458 --> 25:03.750
They hand Ritalin out
like vitamins.

25:03.834 --> 25:05.458
He just needed
more hours in his day.

25:05.542 --> 25:07.375
Kid ever come to your house?

25:07.458 --> 25:09.583
- To my house? No.
- Wrong answer.

25:09.667 --> 25:12.125
Ex-wife says he was
there
Friday before he died.

25:12.208 --> 25:13.166
He come to confront you?

25:13.250 --> 25:15.709
Yes, but not about the pills.

25:15.792 --> 25:18.291
That was just
the tip of the iceberg.

25:19.500 --> 25:20.583
What are you doing here?

25:20.667 --> 25:22.041
The tournament's
at 7:30 in the morning.

25:22.125 --> 25:24.959
- I gotta give these back.
- Didn't they help?

25:25.041 --> 25:27.583
Helped me realize
what's wrong with how we
debate.

25:27.667 --> 25:30.375
At Jefferson, I used to enjoy
doing this, discussing ideas.

25:30.458 --> 25:31.875
Now it's just about
cranking on these pills

25:31.959 --> 25:33.792
so I can crush
everybody with research.

25:33.875 --> 25:35.583
I'm not who I was anymore.

25:35.667 --> 25:37.250
You've won four
tournaments in a
row.

25:37.333 --> 25:39.542
I mean, that is better than
any Maynard team ever did.

25:39.625 --> 25:40.667
But what's the point
if I don't care

25:40.750 --> 25:44.458
about anything that I'm saying?

25:44.542 --> 25:46.500
There are two education systems
in this country

25:46.583 --> 25:49.166
one for the have's,
another for the not's.

25:49.250 --> 25:52.041
Wait...you wrote a new case?

25:56.417 --> 25:57.792
You've been reading Freire.

25:57.875 --> 25:59.250
This is pretty complex stuff.

25:59.333 --> 26:00.875
Most of these debate kids

26:00.959 --> 26:02.458
have no idea
how the other half lives

26:02.542 --> 26:03.959
why the poor stay poor

26:04.041 --> 26:05.959
why my dad couldn't
even think about college.

26:06.041 --> 26:07.375
And we're gonna teach them?

26:07.458 --> 26:09.291
I'm debating the future
leaders of America, right?

26:09.375 --> 26:11.625
If we can change the way
we talk about education--

26:11.709 --> 26:13.709
Yes, but you and
Alyssa are
winning

26:13.792 --> 26:15.125
big tournaments
with the old
case.

26:15.208 --> 26:18.458
We could be national
champions with this one

26:18.542 --> 26:20.375
because I believe in it.

26:23.208 --> 26:24.792
You ever read any Foucault?

26:29.750 --> 26:30.917
There's a piece of evidence here

26:31.000 --> 26:33.917
that's gonna make
your case even
stronger.

26:35.542 --> 26:38.041
I've been pushing
debaters my whole career

26:38.125 --> 26:40.834
and that was the only time
a debater pushed me.

26:40.917 --> 26:43.208
So how'd Alyssa feel
about the new case?

26:43.291 --> 26:44.542
She agreed to it.

26:44.625 --> 26:46.250
They had some kind of
argument at the tournament.

26:46.333 --> 26:47.667
About what?

26:47.750 --> 26:50.000
I asked her,
she didn't wanna talk about
it.

26:50.083 --> 26:52.875
Look, the drug thing
was really stupid

26:52.959 --> 26:55.709
but I could lose my job
if people find out.

26:55.792 --> 26:56.834
You should have
thought about
that

26:56.917 --> 26:59.542
before you gave 'em to Luke.

27:11.375 --> 27:13.208
My dad used to be a cop.

27:13.291 --> 27:15.458
Back then, people
respected their
service.

27:15.542 --> 27:17.166
They didn't sweat
the small stuff.

27:17.250 --> 27:18.458
I wish.

27:18.542 --> 27:20.959
He used to bring home
cartons of cigarettes

27:21.041 --> 27:22.834
fruit, toys for us.

27:22.917 --> 27:24.917
All of it fell off a truck.

27:25.000 --> 27:25.959
Sounds pretty sweet.

27:27.083 --> 27:28.709
Not like today, huh, where..

27:28.792 --> 27:32.834
...everybody's up in your
business about everything?

27:35.709 --> 27:36.917
Fit as a fiddle.

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
You got your
hearing,
you got your vision

27:39.083 --> 27:40.375
and you got your looks.

27:40.458 --> 27:42.709
I can see why you're so
popular around the station.

27:42.792 --> 27:46.709
Just promise me you'll eat an
apple once in a while,
alright?

27:46.792 --> 27:49.500
Scout's honor.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.000
Hey, a package
showed up for you.

27:53.083 --> 27:55.750
Something from
"Elkayam Jewelers"?

27:55.834 --> 27:59.125
Yeah, yeah,
I've been waiting on
that.

28:00.709 --> 28:03.083
Hey, check this out.
This is Luke's last
round.

28:03.166 --> 28:05.083
'I got it from
the tournament archives.'

28:13.000 --> 28:13.917
You know what?
Forget it.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.792
I don't need this evidence.

28:17.959 --> 28:19.917
'Look, here's
what I'm trying to say.'

28:20.000 --> 28:21.417
'The neighborhood I come from'

28:21.500 --> 28:24.083
'no one gets
the opportunities you all
do.'

28:24.166 --> 28:25.250
I got out because I'm smart

28:25.333 --> 28:27.792
or whatever,
but you shouldn't have to
be

28:27.875 --> 28:30.000
a genius to get
a decent
education.

28:30.083 --> 28:32.625
'People like
my father deserve better.'

28:32.709 --> 28:33.625
If you're looking for evidence

28:33.709 --> 28:35.291
put away your pen.

28:36.959 --> 28:40.250
I am my own evidence.

28:40.333 --> 28:42.333
'I know this might
sound strange, but..'

28:42.417 --> 28:44.667
...I'd like to have
a real conversation now.

28:47.792 --> 28:50.625
Look familiar?

28:50.709 --> 28:53.959
Alyssa wrote that threat right
in the middle of their round.

28:54.041 --> 28:57.250
Her flight made it into
the air a few hours ago.

28:57.333 --> 28:58.959
Got a car waiting
at the airport.

28:59.041 --> 29:01.834
Give her a nice,
warm Philly welcome.

29:07.083 --> 29:09.625
I told the other
police
this is a mistake.

29:09.709 --> 29:12.333
I've been in Paraguay
for two weeks, building
wells.

29:12.417 --> 29:14.834
Ever shoot a gun, Alyssa?

29:14.917 --> 29:16.500
I won't even touch one.

29:16.583 --> 29:17.875
If you spend one day
in a refugee camp--

29:17.959 --> 29:20.709
Saving the world
one life at a time?

29:20.792 --> 29:22.291
Wanna explain this?

29:24.959 --> 29:26.000
I don't remember
much about debate.

29:26.083 --> 29:26.959
That was a lifetime ago.

29:27.041 --> 29:29.417
But you wrote it, didn't you?

29:29.500 --> 29:31.500
Why would I
want to kill
someone?

29:31.583 --> 29:34.500
You tell us. You gave it
to Luke the night he died.

29:34.583 --> 29:37.250
Luke Cronin killed himself.

29:37.333 --> 29:39.000
Yeah, after
he blew your last round.

29:39.083 --> 29:40.375
Pembrook was a local tournament.

29:40.458 --> 29:42.041
We went three and three
with a new case.

29:42.125 --> 29:43.500
It was no big deal.

29:43.583 --> 29:45.208
I thought you didn't
remember much.

29:45.291 --> 29:46.583
Headspace you were in back then

29:46.667 --> 29:48.625
losing must have seemed
like the end of the world.

29:48.709 --> 29:51.000
If he had just told me
what he was going to
do--

29:51.083 --> 29:52.500
(Jeffries)
'But he didn't.'

29:54.041 --> 29:56.709
Luke was so good
at moving forward

29:56.792 --> 29:58.834
he never saw who he left behind.

30:00.500 --> 30:01.542
Are you insane?

30:01.625 --> 30:03.083
Do you know
who our judge was?

30:03.166 --> 30:04.041
No, calm down.

30:04.125 --> 30:05.500
That was Steve Tanner.

30:05.583 --> 30:07.458
Mr. Dartmouth Debate,
my only way into that school.

30:07.542 --> 30:08.792
What are you talking about?

30:08.875 --> 30:10.041
You're graduating
from Maynard Green

30:10.125 --> 30:11.333
your parents
have
a gazillion
dollars.

30:11.417 --> 30:12.667
But I'm getting "C"s.

30:12.750 --> 30:16.500
You understand?
I bet everything on debate.

30:16.583 --> 30:18.041
You told me you had "A"s.

30:18.125 --> 30:19.542
I can't keep up with
debate and classes.

30:19.625 --> 30:22.041
- I'm not as smart as you,
okay?
- It's not a competition.

30:22.125 --> 30:23.375
And now you go
off script and you pull out

30:23.458 --> 30:24.750
your sob story,
and yeah, it's obvious

30:24.834 --> 30:26.917
that I could play backup
on "The Luke Cronin Show."

30:27.000 --> 30:28.375
So you write me a death threat?

30:28.458 --> 30:30.750
You blew my shot at Dartmouth!

30:33.125 --> 30:36.166
You think going to Ivy is the
only way to make people
listen?

30:36.250 --> 30:39.125
They'll listen now if you
got something worth
saying.

30:40.875 --> 30:42.625
You hypocrite.

30:42.709 --> 30:45.250
You're gonna fix the system
for guys like your dad, right?

30:45.333 --> 30:46.625
That's why I wrote this case.

30:46.709 --> 30:49.000
You care so much about him,
you never even see him.

30:49.083 --> 30:52.875
- 'Cause I'm trying--
- To win, like everybody
else!

30:52.959 --> 30:54.083
Just using different words

30:54.166 --> 30:56.625
but all that you care
about is that judge.

31:00.667 --> 31:01.875
You're right.

31:05.000 --> 31:09.125
Only one who can judge
you...
is you.

31:11.625 --> 31:13.583
After Luke's suicide..

31:13.667 --> 31:16.375
...everything he said sunk in.

31:16.458 --> 31:19.250
Thought it was my punishment
for treating him like that.

31:20.834 --> 31:24.250
"Only one who can judge you,
is you."

31:26.542 --> 31:28.959
After Maynard,
I did some volunteer work

31:29.041 --> 31:30.917
and I got
my priorities straight.

31:33.458 --> 31:35.250
What do these
other symbols mean

31:35.333 --> 31:37.000
'the ones no one can translate?'

31:37.083 --> 31:38.333
We used our own shorthand

31:38.417 --> 31:41.625
so that the other
teams couldn't read
it.

31:41.709 --> 31:44.375
It says
"You don't belong
here.

31:44.458 --> 31:46.458
'"Go back to Oak Lane."'

31:46.542 --> 31:48.041
I still can't
believe
I wrote that.

31:48.125 --> 31:49.125
Oh, don't worry.

31:49.208 --> 31:52.333
We have a way
you can make up for it.

31:53.875 --> 31:56.333
This part right here..

31:56.417 --> 31:58.709
...can you tell
me
what that says?

32:00.750 --> 32:04.166
ATF report came back
on the .38 that killed Luke.

32:04.250 --> 32:08.041
Tracked it to
a gun show in Delaware.

32:08.125 --> 32:11.458
Purchased by
Stan Cronin, July
'97.

32:11.542 --> 32:14.834
I guess Luke's father didn't
hate guns as much as he said.

32:25.583 --> 32:27.834
What was it you told Luke?

32:27.917 --> 32:30.917
"Only one who can
judge you, is
you?"

32:32.875 --> 32:34.959
Best advice I ever give him.

32:35.041 --> 32:37.000
You're just full of wisdom,
aren't you?

32:37.083 --> 32:39.250
Back feeling better these days?

32:39.333 --> 32:41.959
Yes...mostly.

32:42.041 --> 32:45.291
It's kind of strange,
a psychiatrist fixing your
back.

32:45.375 --> 32:48.041
He moonlighting
as a
chiropractor?

32:48.125 --> 32:49.333
Don't know
what you're talking about.

32:49.417 --> 32:51.625
I called the VA hospital.

32:51.709 --> 32:55.625
The only doctor you've seen in
the past 15 years is a shrink.

32:55.709 --> 32:57.667
PTSD specialist.

32:57.750 --> 32:59.500
How do you judge yourself, Stan?

32:59.583 --> 33:01.709
(Vera)
''Cause you weren't in
any hospital bed that night.'

33:01.792 --> 33:04.375
I'm not gonna talk
about this to a pair of cops.

33:04.458 --> 33:06.625
Alright.
You could talk to a jury.

33:06.709 --> 33:09.834
Tell them how you shot
Luke clean through the
head.

33:11.125 --> 33:13.625
I would never hurt my son.

33:15.959 --> 33:19.000
It was your gun that killed him.

33:20.333 --> 33:21.875
I was sick.

33:23.458 --> 33:27.208
I wanted to hurt someone,
but it wasn't Luke.

33:30.125 --> 33:32.709
(Luke)
Fourth quarter start
yet?

33:34.208 --> 33:35.166
'Hey.'

33:35.250 --> 33:41.375
Why isn't the TV on?

33:41.458 --> 33:42.417
Dad?

33:42.500 --> 33:44.917
You aren't supposed
to be home yet.

33:53.834 --> 33:56.917
- What's in your hand?
- Nothin'.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.917
'I want to watch the game.'

33:59.000 --> 34:01.709
Dad.

34:01.792 --> 34:03.625
Give me that. Please.

34:03.709 --> 34:06.834
Tryin' to do
what's best for you, son.

34:06.917 --> 34:08.625
Please, dad,
you're scaring me.

34:08.709 --> 34:10.333
Nothing to be scared of.

34:10.417 --> 34:12.166
You're an amazing kid.

34:13.834 --> 34:15.792
- You're going places.
- No.

34:17.917 --> 34:21.750
I judged myself today,
like you said.

34:21.834 --> 34:24.125
I didn't like what I saw.

34:24.208 --> 34:26.625
Why are you saying that?

34:27.959 --> 34:30.083
Big decision I have to make.

34:31.834 --> 34:35.166
I pro/con'd it on
the train ride over here.

34:37.917 --> 34:39.792
See?

34:41.208 --> 34:45.000
But you gotta
give me the gun, dad.

34:47.917 --> 34:50.333
Now.

34:57.959 --> 35:01.208
Put the gun that killed
my son right in his own
hand.

35:03.083 --> 35:05.417
I can't be awake..

35:05.500 --> 35:08.625
...without wishing
I could take that moment
back.

35:08.709 --> 35:11.000
What decision
was Luke talking
about?

35:11.083 --> 35:12.125
I don't know.

35:12.208 --> 35:14.166
I was too caught up
in my own crap.

35:16.083 --> 35:18.083
Still got the list?

35:30.917 --> 35:34.000
It's the last thing
my son gave me.

35:35.208 --> 35:36.917
Might as well be in Chinese.

35:37.000 --> 35:40.625
- What happened after that?
- Drove me to the VA.

35:40.709 --> 35:43.583
I was in a hospital
bed that night..

35:43.667 --> 35:46.083
...just not in
the polytrauma unit.

35:46.166 --> 35:48.709
- Mental health?
- In suicide watch.

35:50.542 --> 35:53.875
I was still there
when I heard about Luke.

35:53.959 --> 35:55.959
I couldn't bring myself
to tell you earlier.

36:01.959 --> 36:05.000
I always thought
I drove him to it.

36:11.208 --> 36:12.959
I matched up
the symbols Alyssa gave me

36:13.041 --> 36:14.542
from their secret shorthand

36:14.625 --> 36:16.917
and Luke was making
a decision the night he
died.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.083
The cons outweigh the pros.

36:19.166 --> 36:20.667
Luke was about to
quit Maynard debate.

36:20.750 --> 36:24.875
And Coach Darren
was about to lose his
MVP.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.542
I've-I've been
waiting
for over an hour.

36:33.625 --> 36:36.250
I-I think I've been
pretty cooperative.

36:36.333 --> 36:37.375
(Valens)
'Well, sorry, coach.'

36:37.458 --> 36:40.417
Just...one detail

36:40.500 --> 36:41.709
still got us confused.

36:41.792 --> 36:44.083
Now you said Luke
was gonna be your ticket

36:44.166 --> 36:46.834
to winning the Forensics
Tournament of America?

36:46.917 --> 36:47.917
Yeah, that's right.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.250
But it turns out
he was pretty fed up

36:50.333 --> 36:51.959
with Maynard debate.

36:52.041 --> 36:53.750
Even listed the cons.

36:53.834 --> 36:57.166
Elitist, shallow,
obsessed with
winning.

36:58.959 --> 37:00.750
Luke wasn't serious
about quitting.

37:02.041 --> 37:03.709
Never said anything
about quitting,
Darren.

37:03.792 --> 37:07.667
Only one knew Luke was gonna
quit that night was Luke.

37:07.750 --> 37:09.125
(Rush)
'Now isn't that
how you lose a debate?'

37:09.208 --> 37:11.500
You say one wrong
thing
and you blow it?

37:11.583 --> 37:14.625
You lose a debate by not
having the right evidence.

37:14.709 --> 37:18.625
See, the problem with
close-range killings

37:18.709 --> 37:21.041
you get blood on yourself.

37:21.125 --> 37:23.500
Then, you got to drive home.

37:23.583 --> 37:25.458
Yeah, see, the reason
you've been waiting so
long

37:25.542 --> 37:29.291
is, uh, CSU went through
every inch of your Civic.

37:29.375 --> 37:30.542
I don't own a Civic.

37:30.625 --> 37:32.291
You did in '99,
it was brand-new.

37:32.375 --> 37:34.792
So why'd you sell it
the week after Luke died?

37:34.875 --> 37:36.250
I needed a bigger car.

37:36.333 --> 37:38.625
Smart guy like you can't
figure
that out before you buy?

37:38.709 --> 37:40.000
There's a name for
this kind of evidence.

37:40.083 --> 37:41.500
It's called circumstantial.

37:41.583 --> 37:45.500
It's better than an
eyewitness
'cause it doesn't lie.

37:45.583 --> 37:48.500
Found Luke's blood in the car.
That circumstantial too?

37:48.583 --> 37:51.333
You must get a lot
of idiots in here, alright?

37:51.417 --> 37:53.208
You can't check DNA in an hour.

37:53.291 --> 37:54.959
Blood type, it's Luke's.

37:55.041 --> 37:56.792
Found it next to
the tire hump where you stashed

37:56.875 --> 37:57.959
that bloody coat.

37:58.041 --> 38:00.834
Do you not think
that I can see a bluff?

38:00.917 --> 38:02.625
I made it to
Debate National Finals.

38:02.709 --> 38:05.166
1987.

38:05.250 --> 38:07.125
Yeah, we looked that up.

38:07.208 --> 38:09.583
Well, turns out it was you

38:09.667 --> 38:11.375
who lost it, not your partner.

38:11.458 --> 38:13.500
Debate is an
extremely
nuanced activity.

38:13.583 --> 38:14.709
"I lost for

38:14.792 --> 38:16.000
"insulting the other team

38:16.083 --> 38:18.333
'"a profound
sense of arrogance."'

38:18.417 --> 38:20.125
I miss a nuance here somewhere?

38:20.208 --> 38:22.667
- Yes. It was only one round.
- 'Not for you.'

38:22.750 --> 38:24.875
You disappeared off the face
of the earth after that loss.

38:24.959 --> 38:26.625
Because I had to get away
and just decompress.

38:26.709 --> 38:28.083
(Rush)
'So you skipped out
on law school'

38:28.166 --> 38:32.125
became a high school
debate coach instead.

38:35.291 --> 38:36.375
'What do you...what
do you call that?'

38:36.458 --> 38:37.417
'What's that phrase?'

38:37.500 --> 38:39.250
Uh, those who can't do--

38:39.333 --> 38:40.959
- Teach.
- 'That's right.'

38:41.041 --> 38:42.625
They teach.

38:46.250 --> 38:48.041
If I hadn't lost in '87..

38:48.125 --> 38:50.333
...everything would
have been different.

39:15.625 --> 39:17.667
It's freezing out.

39:17.750 --> 39:20.709
What's so important
you call me at 11:30?

39:21.667 --> 39:25.333
Coach...I'm sorry.

39:25.417 --> 39:27.583
I got to quit debate.

39:30.333 --> 39:31.917
Look..

39:32.000 --> 39:34.083
...I don't care that you lost.

39:34.166 --> 39:36.000
Alright? You're passionate
about the case.

39:36.083 --> 39:37.417
We'll just work it hard
next week.

39:37.500 --> 39:39.041
It's not the case.

39:39.125 --> 39:40.792
It's me.

39:40.875 --> 39:43.750
Okay, Luke, you're not quitting.

39:43.834 --> 39:45.125
I put a lot of trust in you.

39:45.208 --> 39:47.750
I...I stuck my neck out
to get you this scholarship.

39:47.834 --> 39:50.709
My dad..

39:50.792 --> 39:53.291
...tried to kill
himself
tonight, okay?

39:53.375 --> 39:56.458
I pulled a gun from his hands.

39:56.542 --> 39:58.542
You brought a gun onto campus?

39:58.625 --> 40:00.792
Can't take it home.

40:00.875 --> 40:01.959
I don't know what to do with it.

40:02.041 --> 40:04.417
I've been driving in circles.

40:06.333 --> 40:09.709
Okay, look, I'm
sorry.
Alright, I'm sorry.

40:09.792 --> 40:11.041
If there's anything
I can do to help..

40:11.125 --> 40:13.959
You can let me off the
hook.
My dad needs me.

40:14.041 --> 40:15.458
What do you mean,
let you off the hook?

40:15.542 --> 40:17.250
If you quit the team,
you lose that scholarship.

40:17.333 --> 40:19.792
So I lose it. I'll go
back
to Jefferson and
debate.

40:19.875 --> 40:20.834
At what tournaments?

40:20.917 --> 40:22.333
Allentown? Scranton?

40:22.417 --> 40:23.667
I used to have fun doing this.

40:23.750 --> 40:25.166
Then what are you gonna do?
End up like your dad?

40:25.250 --> 40:27.000
Lose your brain to the army
and you start working

40:27.083 --> 40:28.458
in some car shop
your whole life?

40:28.542 --> 40:32.083
My dad...is twice
the man you are.

40:32.166 --> 40:33.500
He tried to kill himself!

40:33.583 --> 40:35.709
- Get out of the car.
- You can't do this to the
team.

40:35.792 --> 40:37.667
You don't care about the
team.
You just want trophies.

40:37.750 --> 40:39.917
I'm not letting you go, Luke.
Not after everything I've
done.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.917
I'm not asking
permission.
I quit.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.333
This is the year, Luke!

40:44.417 --> 40:46.333
You blow this chance
and you will regret it

40:46.417 --> 40:50.000
for the rest of your life!

40:50.083 --> 40:52.083
I won't.

40:52.166 --> 40:53.500
Because I'm not you.

40:53.583 --> 40:55.166
Me?
I went to National Finals.

40:55.250 --> 40:56.667
- And lost.
- Because of my partner.

40:56.750 --> 40:58.375
- Because of you!
- Watch your mouth.

40:58.458 --> 41:00.166
- That's not what happened.
- We all know what happened.

41:00.250 --> 41:01.792
- You're a liar.
- That is not true!

41:01.875 --> 41:03.667
Hanging on to a
victory
that doesn't exist.

41:03.750 --> 41:05.542
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Because you never won.

41:05.625 --> 41:07.542
Shut up! Shut up!

43:40.000 --> 43:41.208
