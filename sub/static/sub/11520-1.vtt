01:04.531 --> 01:06.565
Okay, now are you ready?

01:06.567 --> 01:08.333
- Yeah.
- Okay. We're gonna--

01:08.335 --> 01:09.735
you gotta hold on tight.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.703
Squeeze, squeeze.
You ready?

01:19.846 --> 01:22.381
You're the one who should be
in front of the camera.

01:22.383 --> 01:24.249
What are you doin'
hidin' back there?

01:26.252 --> 01:27.920
<i> There she is,</i>
<i> ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:27.922 --> 01:29.955
<i> the most beautiful woman</i>
<i> in the world.</i>

01:29.957 --> 01:32.091
<i> Just like</i>
<i> out of a fairy tale.</i>

01:32.093 --> 01:33.759
<i> Wave to daddy.</i>

01:33.761 --> 01:35.727
- Daddy.

01:35.729 --> 01:37.863
- Hi, daddy.
-<i> Throw daddy a kiss.</i>

02:26.580 --> 02:28.147
Get off me.

02:28.149 --> 02:30.983
Get the fuck off me.
I just wanna sleep.

02:30.985 --> 02:32.117
Shut up!
Get up!

02:32.119 --> 02:34.419
Help! Somebody help.

03:57.204 --> 03:58.237
Hi.

03:58.239 --> 03:59.538
Jen: <i> Pick up the phone!</i>

03:59.540 --> 04:01.240
I can't find it.

04:01.242 --> 04:03.208
<i> I got some news</i>
<i> you're gonna want to hear.</i>

04:03.210 --> 04:04.610
Oh, yeah, what?

04:04.612 --> 04:07.379
Jen: <i> Penguin...</i>
<i> Loved the proposal.</i>

04:07.381 --> 04:08.880
Shut the fuck up!

04:08.882 --> 04:10.249
<i> We've got a deal.</i>

04:10.251 --> 04:11.783
- Are you serious?

04:11.785 --> 04:13.051
- That's awesome!
<i> - Yeah.</i>

04:13.053 --> 04:14.720
<i>They're wiring the money today,</i>

04:14.722 --> 04:16.255
<i> and I got you twice</i>
<i> what you asked me for.</i>

04:16.257 --> 04:17.856
What? You're the best!

04:17.858 --> 04:19.291
Jen:
<i> Yeah, I'm a miracle worker.</i>

04:19.293 --> 04:22.060
Holy shit!
That's great.

04:22.062 --> 04:23.395
So why...
What now?

04:23.397 --> 04:25.264
Jen:
<i>So now you write it.</i>

04:25.266 --> 04:28.133
<i> All they need is a 20-page</i>
<i> excerpt every month</i>

04:28.135 --> 04:30.402
<i> and other than that</i>
<i> you're a free man--</i>

04:30.404 --> 04:33.205
<i> oh, and they wanna have</i>
<i> a party in a few weeks--</i>

04:33.207 --> 04:35.540
black tie, canapes,
et cetera, et cetera.

04:35.542 --> 04:37.075
Whoa! What?

04:37.077 --> 04:38.543
Jen: <i> Go buy yourself</i>
<i> a nice suit.</i>

04:38.545 --> 04:39.878
All right!

04:39.880 --> 04:42.080
Jen: <i> Okay, hon.</i>
<i> Talk later.</i>

06:13.573 --> 06:15.006
Pour it, when you pour it.

06:15.008 --> 06:16.074
First bucket, baby!

06:16.076 --> 06:18.143
- First bucket!
- No, no.

06:18.145 --> 06:20.212
That's one, that's one,
that's one! Bam!

06:20.214 --> 06:22.347
Yeah, yes, motherfucker!

06:22.349 --> 06:24.015
I will ruin you!

06:24.017 --> 06:26.318
<i> Your kids will weep</i>
<i> at your funeral!</i>

06:26.320 --> 06:27.319
<i> Man!</i>

06:27.321 --> 06:28.854
<i> No, no, no!</i>

06:28.856 --> 06:32.724
No, no, no!
Come on, man!

06:32.726 --> 06:34.092
That's what
I'm talkin' about.

06:34.094 --> 06:36.194
That's my money.
Give me that money!

06:36.196 --> 06:38.029
You pay up, bitch.
Gimme that money!

06:38.031 --> 06:39.898
You son of a bitch.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.367
<i> Really? What is this,</i>
<i> a down payment?</i>

06:42.369 --> 06:43.902
<i> Hey, you missed everything.</i>

06:43.904 --> 06:45.437
I know, I know. I had to
go to the courthouse.

06:45.439 --> 06:47.572
Yo, come on.
What are you doin'?

06:47.574 --> 06:49.508
- It's over, right?
- No, we're watchin' the recap.

06:49.510 --> 06:52.277
I gotta watch this
real quick.

06:52.279 --> 06:54.513
Woman on TV:
<i> No body, no weapon.</i>

06:54.515 --> 06:56.548
<i> Next week</i>
<i> hans Reiser goes on trial</i>

06:56.550 --> 06:58.083
<i> for the murder of his wife.</i>

06:58.085 --> 07:00.619
<i> Big questions arise--</i>
<i> did he kill her,</i>

07:00.621 --> 07:02.220
<i> or did she simply</i>
<i> leave her family</i>

07:02.222 --> 07:03.922
<i> to escape a bad marriage.</i>

07:03.924 --> 07:05.590
<i> It's a haunting story</i>

07:05.592 --> 07:09.294
<i> as the investigation of</i>
<i> Nina Reiser continues.</i>

07:09.296 --> 07:11.196
<i> The direct</i>
<i> physical evidence against hans</i>

07:11.198 --> 07:13.098
<i> is limited,</i>
<i> but police have built</i>

07:13.100 --> 07:15.400
<i> a detailed</i>
<i> circumstantial case.</i>

07:15.402 --> 07:19.070
<i> Police have</i>
<i> confirmed they believed</i>
<i> hans Reiser acted alone.</i>

07:19.072 --> 07:20.405
<i> - According to some, Nina...</i>
- What is this?

07:20.407 --> 07:21.907
<i> It's hans.</i>

07:21.909 --> 07:23.442
He made the linux
operating system--

07:23.444 --> 07:25.110
big nerd celebrity.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.112
I'm profiling the case
for <i> wired.</i>

07:27.114 --> 07:28.880
<i> Hans says</i>
<i> he lives for his kids.</i>

07:28.882 --> 07:31.249
<i> In divorce court,</i>
<i> a critical ruling--</i>

07:31.251 --> 07:34.052
<i> hans lost legal custody</i>
<i> of his precious children.</i>

07:34.054 --> 07:35.921
<i> His life was falling apart.</i>

07:35.923 --> 07:37.823
Man:
<i> I don't know where Nina is.</i>

07:37.825 --> 07:41.726
<i> All I know is that the woman</i>
<i> that I love is gone</i>

07:41.728 --> 07:43.595
<i>and her children keep asking me</i>
<i> when she's coming back</i>

07:43.597 --> 07:45.564
<i> and I don't know</i>
<i> what to tell them.</i>

07:45.566 --> 07:47.332
<i> I'm just a husband</i>
<i> and a father.</i>

07:47.334 --> 07:49.267
<i> I'm a victim in all this.</i>

07:49.269 --> 07:52.170
<i> No one took Nina,</i>
<i> no one hurt her.</i>

07:52.172 --> 07:54.339
<i> She just left.</i>

07:54.341 --> 07:56.274
<i> Nina left her family.</i>

07:56.276 --> 07:58.076
<i> And with that,</i>
<i> the last man known</i>

07:58.078 --> 07:59.511
<i> to have seen Nina alive heads</i>
<i> back to his cell.</i>

07:59.513 --> 08:00.645
Hey, can you get me in?

08:00.647 --> 08:02.180
- To the trial?
- Yeah.

08:02.182 --> 08:03.482
Why?

08:03.484 --> 08:05.150
<i> Where is Nina?</i>

08:05.152 --> 08:06.218
<i> Sure.</i>

08:37.316 --> 08:39.351
Jen:
<i> Hey, Stephen, it's Jen.</i>

08:39.352 --> 08:41.553
<i> I know you know those pages</i>
<i> are due at penguin next week.</i>

08:41.554 --> 08:45.056
<i> I hope it's going well.</i>
<i> Give me a call.</i>

08:45.058 --> 08:46.725
<i> Hey, man. It's Josh.</i>

08:46.727 --> 08:48.026
<i> I got you</i>
<i> the Reiser interview.</i>

08:48.028 --> 08:50.529
<i> You're welcome.</i>
<i> Call me.</i>

09:50.423 --> 09:53.592
Who are you?

09:53.594 --> 09:56.127
I'm Stephen Elliott.

09:56.129 --> 09:58.430
<i>Uh, look,</i>
<i>I'm not talking to reporters.</i>

09:58.432 --> 10:00.932
I'm not a reporter.

10:00.934 --> 10:04.636
I just want to write a book.

10:04.638 --> 10:07.706
Well, that's kind of hard

10:07.708 --> 10:10.141
to trust your kind of people.

10:10.143 --> 10:12.644
Writers, they have a way
of spinning things

10:12.646 --> 10:14.379
<i>the way they want to.</i>

10:14.381 --> 10:17.248
Yeah, I know.
I have a lot of
ex-girlfriends

10:17.250 --> 10:21.152
who have accused me
of the same thing.

10:23.624 --> 10:27.726
<i>Well, what do you</i>
<i>want to know?</i>

10:27.728 --> 10:30.395
Anything. I just--

10:30.397 --> 10:32.464
I just want to hear
your story, that's it.

10:32.466 --> 10:33.965
I'm not interested.

10:42.008 --> 10:46.911
There's something there.
He's sitting on something,
just waiting for a big reveal.

10:48.748 --> 10:50.815
Like maybe
he killed his wife.

10:50.817 --> 10:55.453
Yeah, maybe,
but why is the question.

10:55.455 --> 10:57.822
Hey, is anybody dead
out there?

10:57.824 --> 11:00.425
I want to pitch
a book to Jen.

11:00.427 --> 11:01.626
A true crime thing.

11:01.628 --> 11:03.328
- Yeah.
- My <i> in cold blood.</i>

11:03.330 --> 11:05.997
Yeah. Better.
Probably better.

11:07.767 --> 11:09.067
What the hell is that?

11:12.938 --> 11:14.005
Flip it.

11:15.207 --> 11:18.777
That's my team,
from down below.

11:18.779 --> 11:19.778
Sniff it.

11:19.780 --> 11:20.845
You gave me your team?

11:20.847 --> 11:23.181
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.550
- You got any blueberry sauce?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:25.552 --> 11:27.052
Put it where it goes, though.

11:29.055 --> 11:30.221
Yeah, yeah.

11:34.794 --> 11:35.894
The key is to put
a little bit of butter

11:35.896 --> 11:38.963
in the balls like so.

11:38.965 --> 11:42.667
Then you put a nice sloppy
helpin' on there,

11:42.669 --> 11:46.404
and then let the blood flow
right to the other part.

11:46.406 --> 11:49.474
A little wet,
and look at that.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.543
Looks like shit.

11:51.545 --> 11:53.178
All right.
Hot cakes are ready.

11:53.180 --> 11:55.346
Get your asses
in here for some cakes.

11:55.348 --> 11:56.347
Hey!

11:56.349 --> 11:57.649
We cut my hair.

11:57.651 --> 12:00.919
Whoa! Check out this haircut.

12:00.921 --> 12:01.920
God damn it!

12:01.922 --> 12:05.190
Oh-oh! Wow!

12:05.192 --> 12:07.092
He's got it!
That is just...

12:07.094 --> 12:09.561
- What do you...
What do you think of it?
- You like it?

12:09.563 --> 12:12.564
- I think it's awesome.
- I think it's pretty awesome.

12:12.566 --> 12:14.866
I think it's awesome
that you feel awesome

12:14.868 --> 12:18.436
for the last day of school,
but I gotta tell you, man,
that looks terrible.

12:18.438 --> 12:20.038
Hey, you know what though,

12:20.040 --> 12:22.340
maybe you should
put a shirt on.

12:22.342 --> 12:24.409
Looking like a deranged
little ragamuffin with
no shirt on.

13:12.958 --> 13:16.628
Man:
This is not the kind of parent
who disappears without warning.

13:18.264 --> 13:23.101
This is not a mother
who abandons her children.

13:23.103 --> 13:27.672
Nina Reiser was president
of her school's
parent-teacher association.

13:27.674 --> 13:32.443
She chaperoned field trips.
She did the class laundry.

13:32.445 --> 13:36.915
Nina's children
were her entire world.

13:36.917 --> 13:40.685
She would have never,
ever left them willingly.

13:42.154 --> 13:43.855
And she most certainly
wouldn't have left them

13:43.857 --> 13:48.860
with her estranged husband
of whom she was afraid.

13:48.862 --> 13:52.030
The police were called
to the Reiser house

13:52.032 --> 13:55.934
three times during the months
leading up to the separation.

13:55.936 --> 13:58.970
Hans appeared twice
in family court

13:58.972 --> 14:01.472
for refusing to pay for

14:01.474 --> 14:05.443
his children's medical expenses.

14:05.445 --> 14:07.879
The last time
he appeared in court,

14:07.881 --> 14:10.148
his request to have the children
for labor day weekend

14:10.150 --> 14:12.650
was denied.

14:12.652 --> 14:14.619
Twelve hours later,

14:14.621 --> 14:19.390
Nina Reiser disappeared
from the face of the earth.

14:19.392 --> 14:24.062
When he was arrested,
he was carrying $9,000 in cash,

14:24.064 --> 14:29.067
two books about
unsolved homicides

14:29.069 --> 14:31.736
and a three-page letter.

14:33.372 --> 14:36.140
The letter begins...

14:36.142 --> 14:39.911
"I've been telling you
about Nina and nobody listens."

14:41.380 --> 14:45.316
"I may be a danger
to the worldview of some,

14:45.318 --> 14:48.453
but I am no danger
to my children."

14:54.493 --> 14:55.560
Hey.

14:56.862 --> 14:58.129
You forgot your notebook.

15:00.866 --> 15:02.166
This is where
you say thank you.

15:02.168 --> 15:04.202
Thank you.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.004
How much did you read?

15:06.006 --> 15:08.339
Nah, just a little.

15:08.341 --> 15:09.741
I had to find your name.

15:09.743 --> 15:11.676
I want to see
if I should be embarrassed.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.077
I wrote, "hans Reiser trial.

15:13.079 --> 15:15.880
Get transcript
of letter thing."

15:15.882 --> 15:17.715
With search terms like that,
should be a breeze.

15:17.717 --> 15:20.251
Let me see what you wrote.

15:24.723 --> 15:25.790
Whoa!

15:26.792 --> 15:28.459
This is thorough.

15:29.395 --> 15:31.562
So really inadequate.

15:31.564 --> 15:33.965
Miss Lana Edmond.

15:35.634 --> 15:39.203
I write for <i> the times.</i>
Are you covering the trial?

15:39.205 --> 15:40.471
Not sure yet.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.978
Do you want to get a drink?

15:46.980 --> 15:48.313
Like right now
or in general?

15:48.315 --> 15:49.447
Right now.

15:51.717 --> 15:54.152
I have to take a rain check.

15:54.154 --> 15:56.087
I have to do something for work.

15:56.089 --> 15:57.121
All right.
I totally understand.

15:57.123 --> 15:59.457
It's a really big decision.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.225
You have to
think about it a lot.

16:01.227 --> 16:05.830
So you'll have plenty of time
to do that on our way there.

16:05.832 --> 16:07.932
No fucking way!
Is this your bike?

16:07.934 --> 16:08.933
Yeah.

16:08.935 --> 16:11.169
I'm driving.

16:40.799 --> 16:43.968
That's hans' mother's house.

16:43.970 --> 16:46.804
They're right, you know.
The body is buried here.

16:46.806 --> 16:49.207
There's no way
he buried the body that close.

16:49.209 --> 16:50.475
Oh, yeah.

16:50.477 --> 16:52.276
Where would you dump a body?

16:52.278 --> 16:54.779
Hudson canyon.

16:54.781 --> 16:57.548
Okay. It's weird you had
an answer for that, but...

16:57.550 --> 17:00.618
It's in New Jersey
off the coast.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.954
It's this underwater canyon.

17:02.956 --> 17:04.955
It's starts in the basin
and goes out in the ocean,

17:04.958 --> 17:06.824
like 400 miles.

17:06.826 --> 17:09.694
It's as big as the Grand Canyon,
but nobody knows about it.

17:09.695 --> 17:13.564
So people just abandon
things there all the time.

17:15.567 --> 17:18.869
I once dropped
an engagement ring in there.

17:21.973 --> 17:24.208
Sorry.

17:24.210 --> 17:27.478
I don't know
why I just said that.

17:27.480 --> 17:30.848
Jesus Christ!

17:30.850 --> 17:33.985
Um, so what are you
doing tonight?

17:33.987 --> 17:37.055
Lana: I don't know.
What do you have in mind?

17:39.591 --> 17:42.093
Stephen:
"I never went back.

17:42.095 --> 17:45.430
I couldn't stand
to see her that way.

17:45.432 --> 17:47.498
Three months later,
she was dead.

17:49.368 --> 17:51.836
My father told me in the front
seat of his convertible

17:51.838 --> 17:53.604
after finding me in a park.

17:53.606 --> 17:55.006
He was already living
with his new wife

17:55.008 --> 17:57.108
and her children
somewhere in the suburbs.

17:57.110 --> 17:59.210
He wouldn't tell me which one.

17:59.212 --> 18:01.846
I lived on the streets
until an overdose
put me in the hospital

18:01.848 --> 18:04.515
and I became
a ward of the state.

18:04.517 --> 18:07.385
The day my father was found
guilty of abuse and neglect,

18:07.387 --> 18:09.187
I sat beside him in court.

18:09.189 --> 18:11.622
Right before my statement,
he pulled me close,

18:11.624 --> 18:14.258
so it would look like
he was hugging me,

18:14.260 --> 18:16.260
and then he whispered
in my ear,

18:16.262 --> 18:19.130
'you know it's all your fault,
right?

18:19.132 --> 18:22.266
You killed your mother.'

18:22.268 --> 18:25.269
that's what I could never
explain to the lawyers
and case workers.

18:25.271 --> 18:27.472
It wasn't about the handcuffs
or the beatings

18:27.474 --> 18:28.973
or his shaving my head.

18:28.975 --> 18:30.641
That was nothing.

18:30.643 --> 18:32.376
It was the constant suggestion

18:32.378 --> 18:33.778
that I was doing
something wrong,

18:33.780 --> 18:37.148
that I was inherently poisonous
and to blame

18:37.150 --> 18:39.584
for the series of abuses
and abandonment

18:39.586 --> 18:41.886
that marked my adolescence.

18:41.888 --> 18:44.255
He made that suggestion
in countless, subtle

18:44.257 --> 18:47.592
and more obvious ways
all the years he was alive."

18:47.594 --> 18:48.893
Man: This is bullshit.

18:53.098 --> 18:58.069
"In the end his passing
brought me no satisfaction,

18:58.071 --> 19:00.638
no closure.
The day he died..."

19:00.640 --> 19:03.908
Jesus Christ, how can
you people listen to this crap?

19:05.644 --> 19:09.113
Oh my god, it's a ghost!
Boo!

19:09.115 --> 19:11.649
My son, ladies and gentlemen.

19:11.651 --> 19:15.019
The poor, abused orphan,
the underdog.

19:15.021 --> 19:19.023
How convenient for you to have
a dead monster for a father.

19:19.025 --> 19:21.192
How utterly pitiable.

19:21.194 --> 19:23.761
I should be gettin' royalties
for this shit.

19:23.763 --> 19:26.764
My son, the storyteller--
what a fucking joke!

19:26.766 --> 19:31.335
You deserve to be played
fallin' for this nonsense.

19:31.337 --> 19:35.773
My son was never homeless.
He was never in group homes.

19:35.775 --> 19:37.475
He was a drug addict fuck-up

19:37.477 --> 19:39.377
who wants to seem
interesting and dramatic

19:39.379 --> 19:41.112
and take your money
is what he wants.

19:41.114 --> 19:42.680
All right, Neil,
you gotta go.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.148
- How are you doing?
- You gotta go.

19:44.150 --> 19:45.283
Get your fuckin' hands
off of me!

19:45.285 --> 19:46.717
- You gotta go.
- I gotta go?

19:50.022 --> 19:54.992
You're a fuckin'
coward... always have been.

19:54.994 --> 19:59.130
You people are all fools
to listen to this bullshit.

20:10.075 --> 20:11.275
Um...

20:29.194 --> 20:32.663
You know, I haven't seen him
in seven years.

20:32.665 --> 20:34.098
The one thing we can
agree on though is that

20:34.100 --> 20:36.167
we're just dead to each other.

20:36.169 --> 20:37.935
You don't have to
explain to me.

20:41.540 --> 20:43.441
Well, unfortunately,
i don't think everyone else

20:43.443 --> 20:44.642
will feel that way.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.312
But thank you.

20:51.850 --> 20:54.352
I tried to kill
my stepfather once...

20:56.588 --> 20:59.357
...when I was 16.

20:59.359 --> 21:03.027
I worked in a pharmacy,
and I did the research.

21:03.029 --> 21:04.795
I figured out what kind of
pill I would need

21:04.797 --> 21:06.264
and how much it
would take to kill a man,

21:06.266 --> 21:08.466
the whole thing, right?

21:08.468 --> 21:11.602
I put a few pills in my pocket
every day before I left work,

21:11.604 --> 21:14.071
saved up enough,
ground them up

21:14.073 --> 21:15.973
and put them
in his fancy bottle of scotch

21:15.975 --> 21:18.142
that he wouldn't let
anyone else touch.

21:20.912 --> 21:23.047
So you killed him.

21:23.049 --> 21:24.115
Nope.

21:25.784 --> 21:28.052
Not even close.

21:28.054 --> 21:29.587
Nothing happened.

21:29.589 --> 21:32.990
It just went right through
his system.

21:32.992 --> 21:34.458
He was that fat.

21:36.829 --> 21:38.496
I guess I shouldn't laugh.

21:42.067 --> 21:43.534
You'll get to funny one day.

21:45.337 --> 21:46.570
It just takes time.

22:34.720 --> 22:37.355
Stephen: So what were you like
in high school?

22:37.357 --> 22:40.524
Lana: Me? I was a bad ass.

22:40.526 --> 22:42.159
A bad ass?

22:42.161 --> 22:43.294
Lana: Oh, yeah. I had a punk
band and everything.

22:43.296 --> 22:44.695
What were you called?

22:44.697 --> 22:46.297
We were called the lys dexics.

22:46.299 --> 22:48.366
- What?
- Think about it.

22:48.368 --> 22:49.967
Oh, like dyslexic.

22:49.969 --> 22:53.738
I played bass,
which is ridiculous

22:53.740 --> 22:56.841
because I can't even hear
bass notes. But whatever.

22:56.843 --> 22:59.143
There's only like
four of them, so.

22:59.145 --> 23:00.911
And then we had
this whole bit

23:00.913 --> 23:03.247
where I sprayed hairspray
into Mattie's lighter.

23:03.249 --> 23:05.015
It was very cool.

23:05.017 --> 23:07.051
Wish I could have
seen you then.

23:07.053 --> 23:10.788
A little delinquent, yeah?

23:14.693 --> 23:16.193
So why'd you break up?

23:16.195 --> 23:18.429
- Lana: <i> The band?</i>
- Uh-hmm.

23:18.431 --> 23:20.731
I guess I ultimately
figured out

23:20.733 --> 23:23.501
it was less fun to have bad sex

23:23.503 --> 23:26.036
in the back of a Van sober.

23:26.038 --> 23:27.938
What kind of sober?

23:27.940 --> 23:30.241
Not wanting to be
my stepfather kind.

23:35.547 --> 23:38.783
Do you mind if I ask
what he did to you?

23:41.019 --> 23:43.587
It's in the past.

23:43.589 --> 23:45.890
I'm not looking
over my shoulder.

23:45.892 --> 23:49.627
I know, but what happens
to us makes us who we are.

23:49.629 --> 23:52.963
No. Fuck them!

23:52.965 --> 23:55.366
That has nothing to do
with who I am.

23:55.368 --> 23:58.769
He has nothing to do
with who I became.

23:58.771 --> 24:00.504
That doesn't mean
you need to bury it.

24:02.474 --> 24:04.341
I'm not burying anything.

24:07.312 --> 24:09.447
I've just got some souvenirs.

24:11.917 --> 24:13.517
Stephen:
I think you're perfect.

24:15.320 --> 24:17.488
I wouldn't want you
any other way.

24:54.759 --> 24:55.826
Hey!

24:57.329 --> 24:58.529
Jesus!

24:58.531 --> 25:00.030
Where the hell
have you been?

25:00.032 --> 25:01.999
Oh... uh, I just...

25:02.001 --> 25:04.001
I needed a little time,
that's all.

25:04.003 --> 25:05.069
Come in.

25:09.274 --> 25:11.175
What are you doing?

25:11.177 --> 25:13.477
Oh, it's this thing
Roger turned me on to.

25:13.479 --> 25:15.045
You heat it up
to 209 degrees.

25:15.047 --> 25:19.783
No, I mean, what in the actual
fuck are we gonna do?

25:19.785 --> 25:21.385
I don't know.

25:21.387 --> 25:24.288
Uh, I never really had a plan

25:24.290 --> 25:27.358
for when life
shits the bed like this.

25:29.528 --> 25:32.863
Do you have any sense
of how many phone calls

25:32.865 --> 25:37.067
and hysterical emails
I've gotten?

25:37.069 --> 25:41.305
As a matter of fact, I do.
I changed my number.

25:41.307 --> 25:43.507
Thanks for letting me know.

25:43.509 --> 25:45.342
So here's where we are.

25:45.344 --> 25:48.746
Random house is backing out
of the short story collection.

25:50.383 --> 25:53.984
Columbia wants to buy you out
of your teaching contract.

25:53.986 --> 25:56.887
- Fuck them.
- Essentially, everyone

25:56.889 --> 26:00.357
is on the verge of suing us.

26:00.359 --> 26:02.726
The penguin thing--
that's over, too?

26:02.728 --> 26:04.995
Not yet.

26:04.997 --> 26:07.531
I have managed
to talk them down,

26:07.533 --> 26:09.567
but you have got to
work with me here.

26:09.569 --> 26:12.570
Okay. All right.
Just tell me how.

26:12.572 --> 26:16.440
Okay. First of all,
you have to tell me the truth.

26:16.442 --> 26:17.541
All right. Easy.

26:17.543 --> 26:19.877
Everything.

26:19.879 --> 26:23.914
Look, yeah, my dad
isn't dead, obviously.

26:23.916 --> 26:25.583
But that's it.

26:25.585 --> 26:28.552
So why does Neil say that
you never lived in a group home?

26:28.554 --> 26:31.355
Why does he say
you were never homeless?

26:31.357 --> 26:32.756
Why? Because...

26:32.758 --> 26:36.393
My dad's crazy,
that's why!

26:36.395 --> 26:38.395
I don't know. I've been trying
to figure it out my whole life.

26:38.397 --> 26:40.297
He just... he doesn't want me
to be happy.

26:40.299 --> 26:41.599
Do you have proof?

26:43.201 --> 26:44.802
What kind of proof?

26:44.804 --> 26:46.503
I don't know.
Records.

26:47.939 --> 26:49.039
I mean, not on me.

26:49.041 --> 26:51.075
Find some-- quick!

26:51.077 --> 26:54.445
I believe you,
but you've gotta cover your ass.

26:54.447 --> 26:55.613
Okay.

26:55.615 --> 26:58.582
Next, you've got to write

26:58.584 --> 27:02.453
a press release statement
like now.

27:06.091 --> 27:09.660
Next, penguin has gotta

27:09.662 --> 27:11.629
have some pages asap!

27:13.832 --> 27:16.667
Unless you start producing,
this all goes away.

27:54.472 --> 27:56.573
Kill yourself,
you fuckin' asshole.

28:25.170 --> 28:27.404
- Whad'ya got?
- I already paid for that.

28:27.406 --> 28:28.639
Neil:
Don't be stupid.

28:54.033 --> 28:56.233
Say what do you want from me.

28:58.703 --> 29:01.238
I don't know.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.907
I know exactly
what you like, don't I?

29:14.586 --> 29:17.254
Man: Hi, cori.

29:17.256 --> 29:20.190
Cori, do you remember
drawing that picture?

29:20.192 --> 29:21.191
Yes.

29:21.193 --> 29:22.593
Why did you draw it?

29:22.595 --> 29:25.062
I drew it
to show what happened.

29:25.064 --> 29:28.899
Hans went away for a long time,
and when he came back,

29:28.901 --> 29:30.868
he had this very big bag.

29:30.870 --> 29:33.137
Inside the bag there were
so many rolls of tape,

29:33.139 --> 29:36.774
like a ball,
and hans took it to his car.

29:36.776 --> 29:40.110
Now, in your picture,

29:40.112 --> 29:42.446
the bag is zipped up.

29:42.448 --> 29:45.382
Could you actually see
what was in the bag
or were you just kind of

29:45.384 --> 29:47.818
imagining
what might be in there?

29:49.254 --> 29:51.622
Imagining.

29:51.624 --> 29:53.557
Man:
And who asked you to draw it?

29:53.559 --> 29:55.726
Cori:
The psychologist.

29:55.728 --> 29:57.895
Man: Now, did you remember
the part about your dad

29:57.897 --> 30:01.899
carrying the bag before
the psychologist talked to you?

30:03.067 --> 30:05.102
I'm not sure.

30:05.104 --> 30:07.938
Do you have trouble
with keeping things
straight sometimes, cori?

30:07.940 --> 30:10.674
Do you get a little, you know,
confused, sometimes?

30:10.676 --> 30:11.909
I don't want to
do this anymore.

30:11.911 --> 30:14.244
Can I stop now?

30:14.246 --> 30:16.180
Okay. Thank you, pal.

30:18.917 --> 30:20.784
Did cori
always call his parents

30:20.786 --> 30:22.152
by their first names?

30:22.154 --> 30:24.688
No, I don't think so,
actually.

30:24.690 --> 30:27.691
It seemed at some of the earlier
custody trial statements,
he would say "my mom",

30:27.693 --> 30:31.061
but I don't know when he started
calling hans "hans".

30:32.964 --> 30:35.766
Do you think we could get
the family court documents?

30:35.768 --> 30:38.702
Some of them.
Anything public record.

30:38.704 --> 30:39.770
Can I see it?

30:41.306 --> 30:42.706
All right. So this is
the first one

30:42.708 --> 30:46.009
where cori is calling
his mother Nina,

30:46.011 --> 30:47.444
and hans was already
called hans.

30:47.446 --> 30:48.946
Hmmm.

30:48.948 --> 30:51.815
This was three months
before she disappeared.

30:51.817 --> 30:53.817
Mm-hmm.

30:53.819 --> 30:56.119
Hey, can you get documents
from other states,

30:56.121 --> 30:57.888
not just New York?

30:57.890 --> 31:00.824
Uh, yeah. Wha--
what are you thinking?

31:00.826 --> 31:03.126
Illinois.

31:03.128 --> 31:05.329
Yeah, sure. Why?

31:05.331 --> 31:08.665
'Cause I grew up in Chicago.

31:08.667 --> 31:09.766
What are you looking for?

31:11.636 --> 31:13.337
How about the hearing

31:13.339 --> 31:16.573
where my father was convicted
of neglect and abuse

31:16.575 --> 31:18.876
and I was made
a ward of the state.

31:21.913 --> 31:23.547
What are you
gonna do with it?

31:23.549 --> 31:25.415
I don't know. All my book
deals went to shit,

31:25.417 --> 31:26.850
and my editor says
they're gonna stay that way

31:26.852 --> 31:28.886
until I come up
with some proof

31:28.888 --> 31:30.921
that all that stuff
actually happened.

31:30.923 --> 31:33.824
I have to publish it
in an important publication.

31:34.859 --> 31:38.262
Like say <i> the times?</i>

31:38.264 --> 31:40.430
Stephen:
I wouldn't ask you to do that.

31:40.432 --> 31:44.001
I kind of just did,
but that's okay.

31:44.003 --> 31:45.502
I'd love to help.

31:49.540 --> 31:51.308
Does this look like
what you're looking for?

31:52.410 --> 31:54.011
Stephen:
Yeah.

31:54.013 --> 31:56.747
Now the only problem is
i can't write it.

31:56.749 --> 31:59.516
Of course you can.
Write whatever you want.

31:59.518 --> 32:01.318
Stephen: No, I just can't write.
I mean...

32:02.453 --> 32:03.887
It just happens.

32:03.889 --> 32:06.657
Last time
it lasted six months.

32:07.592 --> 32:08.659
Lana:
And then what?

32:10.228 --> 32:11.929
Then I started taking
Adderall.

32:13.298 --> 32:15.999
Okay. It's printing.

32:28.246 --> 32:32.649
What if we published
this as is? Hmmm?

32:32.651 --> 32:34.418
Print it full page,

32:34.420 --> 32:37.754
complete with your
handwritten annotations.

32:37.756 --> 32:40.257
That's something
people would notice,

32:40.259 --> 32:43.226
and you wouldn't have to
write anything.

32:43.228 --> 32:45.929
I think that you're brilliant.

32:45.931 --> 32:47.130
I know.

33:10.455 --> 33:13.757
There's a term
for what you are right now.

33:13.759 --> 33:14.992
Cunt struck.

33:14.994 --> 33:16.960
- Fuck you.
- Cunt struck.

33:16.962 --> 33:17.961
That's not a word.

33:17.963 --> 33:19.262
Yeah, that is.

33:19.264 --> 33:21.932
It's an old word,
old-timey word.

33:21.934 --> 33:23.233
It's like cuntwinked.

33:24.869 --> 33:29.773
Or the more politically
correct version, hoodwinked.

33:29.775 --> 33:31.041
Come on,
you don't know this?

33:31.043 --> 33:32.042
No.

33:32.044 --> 33:33.043
Huh?

33:33.045 --> 33:35.278
What's the male version?

33:35.280 --> 33:38.482
- Cock hobbled.
- Shut the fuck up!

33:38.484 --> 33:39.850
Come on. You gonna match with
me and you don't know that?

33:50.862 --> 33:53.330
Hey. I put this on

33:53.332 --> 33:55.365
so I'd remember
to give it to you.

33:58.236 --> 33:59.369
Remember this?

34:01.472 --> 34:02.873
Yeah.

34:02.875 --> 34:05.742
Yeah. I was going through
this old box

34:05.744 --> 34:06.877
and thought
I'd give it back to you.

34:06.879 --> 34:08.911
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

34:08.914 --> 34:11.748
You sure you're ready to part
ways with that?

34:12.917 --> 34:14.518
Thought
it would make you happy.

34:14.520 --> 34:16.686
- Yeah, it did.
- You could give it to Jax.

34:16.688 --> 34:18.321
It belonged to
my grandmother.

34:18.322 --> 34:19.356
Stephen:
Yeah, I remember.

34:22.927 --> 34:25.262
You gave it to me
the night after I overdosed.

34:25.264 --> 34:28.231
Remember, you said
it would protect me?

34:28.233 --> 34:29.498
I sure don't.

34:31.402 --> 34:32.668
It meant a lot to me
at the time.

34:32.670 --> 34:35.205
Yeah? That's interesting.

34:35.206 --> 34:37.407
'Cause I didn't give it to you,
Stephen.

34:37.409 --> 34:38.442
- What?
- It got stolen

34:38.444 --> 34:40.677
from my jacket at a party.

34:40.679 --> 34:42.746
What are you talking about?
I was in the hospital
at Northwestern.

34:42.748 --> 34:44.081
You snuck in to visit me.

34:44.083 --> 34:47.551
No, doesn't matter.
Forget it.

34:47.553 --> 34:49.186
It matters to me.

34:53.724 --> 34:55.192
Look, you were
pissed off at me

34:55.194 --> 34:56.560
'cause I made that shitty joke
about your mom

34:56.562 --> 34:58.728
in the wheelchair
peein' herself, yeah?

34:58.730 --> 35:00.464
- Yeah, I remember.
- Yeah, and the chain broke,

35:00.466 --> 35:01.798
and I had it in my jacket pocket

35:01.800 --> 35:04.401
and then it went missin'
at the party.

35:04.403 --> 35:06.069
This is not how
i remember it.

35:06.071 --> 35:07.938
I believe that's not
how you remember,

35:07.940 --> 35:10.507
because you have a convenient
way of rememberin' things.

35:12.310 --> 35:14.144
- What? We're done?
- Yeah, we're done.

35:19.617 --> 35:20.684
Roger.

35:41.806 --> 35:44.107
Lana: Why don't you just tell me
what you're looking for?

35:44.109 --> 35:45.308
What you like?

35:47.578 --> 35:49.479
Because I don't want to
scare you away.

35:51.349 --> 35:54.017
Do I seem like
somebody scared to you?

35:54.019 --> 35:55.085
Stephen:
No.

35:56.854 --> 35:59.689
You're the last person
i want to show my flaws to.

36:01.259 --> 36:03.160
You're showing them
to somebody.

36:03.162 --> 36:06.129
I know you're not getting
these marks on your own.

36:06.131 --> 36:09.799
No, I'm not.

36:09.801 --> 36:12.269
I just don't want to wonder
who else you're with.

36:14.172 --> 36:15.505
Give me a chance.

36:23.347 --> 36:24.748
Tie this wrist.

36:34.458 --> 36:36.293
Now tie it to the bed.

36:41.032 --> 36:42.399
Now tie this one.

36:44.235 --> 36:45.302
Tie it really tight.

36:50.074 --> 36:51.274
Like that?

36:52.543 --> 36:53.610
Yeah.

36:55.046 --> 36:56.746
Take one nail.

36:58.082 --> 36:59.282
Run it down.

37:01.419 --> 37:02.619
Slower.

37:03.688 --> 37:04.754
Slow.

37:06.490 --> 37:07.591
<i> Harder.</i>

37:09.260 --> 37:10.994
<i> Harder.</i>

37:12.164 --> 37:13.230
Like that?

37:13.232 --> 37:14.931
Stephen:
<i> Yeah.</i>

37:16.668 --> 37:17.734
<i> Kiss me.</i>

37:19.370 --> 37:22.105
Well, fine,
but I like the hans idea.

37:22.107 --> 37:24.774
Jen:
<i> Look, I think they have</i>
<i> the right to voice a concern.</i>

37:24.776 --> 37:26.176
<i> This doesn't even</i>
<i> resemble the book</i>

37:26.178 --> 37:27.244
<i> they're paying you to write.</i>

37:27.246 --> 37:28.912
Okay, no, fine.

37:28.914 --> 37:30.847
I did that,
but it's a better idea.

37:30.849 --> 37:35.552
<i> Yeah, I'm not really sure</i>
<i>that I can sell this, Steve.</i>

37:35.554 --> 37:38.054
Look, Norman mailer,
Truman capote...

37:38.056 --> 37:40.357
They were both
at the top of their games

37:40.359 --> 37:43.460
and then they got
massive writer's block, right?

37:43.462 --> 37:45.095
- And then?
-<i> They fell into addiction.</i>

37:45.097 --> 37:48.798
Exactly.
And what happens?
A murder trial.

37:48.800 --> 37:52.235
Truman capote
writes his masterpiece,
changes American literature.

37:52.237 --> 37:54.771
Norman mailer wins
the freakin' pulitzer prize.

37:54.773 --> 37:57.941
Jen: <i> Oh, so hans Reiser is</i>
<i> gonna win you a pulitzer now?</i>

37:57.943 --> 38:02.279
No, I'm just...
He's interesting, that's all.
It's what I want to write.

38:02.281 --> 38:06.383
<i> Fine. As long as</i>
<i> you're actually</i>
<i> writing something.</i>

38:06.385 --> 38:08.218
<i> I don't know.</i>
<i> I guess we'll figure it out.</i>

38:08.220 --> 38:10.120
<i> You're gonna have to</i>
<i> get me some pages</i>

38:10.122 --> 38:11.254
<i> if you want me to pitch</i>
<i> this change, actual pages.</i>

38:11.256 --> 38:13.290
Um, cool.
You got it.

38:13.292 --> 38:14.891
Yes, I promise.
I promise. I promise.

38:14.893 --> 38:16.393
<i> Okay.</i>

38:16.395 --> 38:17.560
Okay. Bye.

38:19.063 --> 38:20.563
I made breakfast.

38:20.565 --> 38:21.831
I see that.

38:21.833 --> 38:23.633
Eggs Benedict.

38:26.237 --> 38:27.304
What's wrong?

38:27.306 --> 38:28.405
Nothing.

38:29.774 --> 38:31.608
It's just um...

38:31.610 --> 38:34.210
This was taped
to my front door.

38:37.081 --> 38:38.815
Motherfucker!

38:59.270 --> 39:02.172
You stay away from her.
If you ever hurt them,

39:02.174 --> 39:03.707
I swear to god
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

39:03.709 --> 39:07.143
Oh, come on.
You're so dramatic!

39:07.145 --> 39:08.678
- Come here.
- No.

39:08.680 --> 39:10.013
Oh! I see how it is.

39:10.015 --> 39:12.382
Tough guy.

39:12.384 --> 39:16.553
All right,
you handsome motherfucker.

39:16.555 --> 39:17.721
At least come on in.

39:18.856 --> 39:19.923
Come on!

39:22.493 --> 39:24.894
You want a 7-up?

39:24.896 --> 39:27.063
Hey, let's get a steak, huh?
My treat.

39:27.065 --> 39:28.365
Where's Cynthia?

39:28.367 --> 39:30.467
She's in Florida.

39:30.469 --> 39:32.035
You know how much I can't stand
the fuckin' silverbacks.

39:32.037 --> 39:34.037
So you're just
spending her money alone?

39:34.039 --> 39:36.406
Yeah, she sends her love
to you, too.

39:36.408 --> 39:40.143
Cynthia, you know,
she had me clean out the attic.

39:40.145 --> 39:42.078
I was visiting
your step-sister.

39:42.080 --> 39:44.681
She's going to Yale now,
did you know that?

39:44.683 --> 39:47.717
I thought I might stop by here

39:47.719 --> 39:49.619
and see if you wanted
any of this.

40:07.706 --> 40:10.173
You came all this way
to give me a box?

40:10.175 --> 40:11.808
I came to see my son.

40:13.077 --> 40:14.611
Why? You obviously hate me.

40:14.613 --> 40:16.613
Oh, hey, now come on,
don't say that.

40:16.615 --> 40:17.847
Why do you say that?

40:17.849 --> 40:19.883
'Cause you humiliated me!

40:19.885 --> 40:22.218
Congratulations,
i hope you're happy.

40:22.220 --> 40:23.887
I'm not happy.

40:23.889 --> 40:25.555
That didn't make me happy.

40:25.557 --> 40:27.023
Then why would you do that?

40:27.025 --> 40:29.459
You told everyone
i was dead.

40:29.461 --> 40:31.294
So did you!

40:31.296 --> 40:35.298
Yeah, well, I mean, there's
storytellers in this family.

40:35.300 --> 40:38.268
I-- I've read everything
you've ever written.

40:38.270 --> 40:40.136
I've come all the way
across the country

40:40.138 --> 40:43.406
to this fancy party where
they're celebrating my son,

40:43.408 --> 40:45.408
the big-shot literary genius

40:45.410 --> 40:47.811
because I'm proud of you
and I'm sittin' there,

40:47.813 --> 40:49.646
listenin' to these stories,
and every time,

40:49.648 --> 40:51.381
the monster father
dies a horrible death

40:51.383 --> 40:53.216
and those assholes
in their party clothes,

40:53.218 --> 40:54.951
they're all happy about it.

40:54.953 --> 40:56.219
How do you think
that makes me feel?

40:56.221 --> 40:57.887
You're not doing this.

40:57.889 --> 41:00.757
You're not turning it around
to make it about you.

41:00.759 --> 41:04.127
I'm not going to feel guilty
for not keeping your secrets.

41:04.129 --> 41:05.795
My secrets?
What about yours?

41:05.797 --> 41:07.897
All right,
look, here you go.

41:07.899 --> 41:09.732
What do you got?

41:09.734 --> 41:12.001
Here's the court hearing
where you were convicted

41:12.003 --> 41:14.804
of seven counts
of neglect and abuse.

41:14.806 --> 41:17.507
Here's the police report
for when I was homeless

41:17.509 --> 41:20.009
'cause you were hiding with
your fucking replacement family!

41:20.011 --> 41:22.745
Hiding?
I looked everywhere for you.

41:22.747 --> 41:24.747
You were a strung-out
drug addict.

41:24.749 --> 41:26.749
I roamed the streets
tryin' to save your life.

41:26.751 --> 41:27.917
Oh, you were gonna save me?

41:27.919 --> 41:29.185
Yes, save you.
I had to restrain you.

41:29.187 --> 41:31.354
You were tryin'
to kill yourself.

41:31.356 --> 41:34.824
You fuckin'
beat the shit out of me,

41:34.826 --> 41:36.459
and I was too little
to fight back!

41:36.461 --> 41:38.661
I was grieving.
I was doing my best!

41:38.663 --> 41:40.697
You were grieving?
As if I wasn't!

41:40.699 --> 41:42.665
As if I wasn't
fuckin' grieving!

41:42.667 --> 41:45.635
You pick at the details,
you missed the entire
context of this thing.

41:45.637 --> 41:47.270
- The context?
- Yeah.

41:47.272 --> 41:49.005
The context is you were
a fuckin' nightmare!

41:49.007 --> 41:50.507
You were a nightmare!

41:50.509 --> 41:52.041
You made my life
a livin' hell.

41:52.043 --> 41:53.510
You terrorized my family.

41:53.512 --> 41:55.945
I'm your family!

41:55.947 --> 41:58.948
I was your fuckin' family,
and you fuckin' abandoned me!

41:58.950 --> 42:00.583
That's not true!

42:05.155 --> 42:06.723
You're not goin' anywhere.

42:06.725 --> 42:09.125
Get off of me!

42:33.083 --> 42:35.385
Fucker!

42:35.387 --> 42:36.753
You son of a bitch!

42:44.762 --> 42:47.764
I didn't abandon you.

42:47.766 --> 42:50.066
You left home,
for god's sake!

42:53.771 --> 42:55.605
You know what,
you're right.

42:55.607 --> 42:57.774
<i> You have another family</i>
<i> to take care of.</i>

42:57.776 --> 42:59.742
My father is dead.
I'm a fucking orphan.

42:59.744 --> 43:01.511
- You don't mean that!
- Yes, I do!

43:01.513 --> 43:04.113
You don't know what
you're sayin' right now.

43:04.115 --> 43:07.083
You're a pathetic old man,
and you're gonna die
miserable and alone,

43:07.085 --> 43:08.518
and you fuckin' deserve it!

43:08.520 --> 43:09.586
<i> Stephen!</i>

43:10.854 --> 43:12.088
Stephen!

43:14.892 --> 43:16.859
Stephen, come back here!

43:43.821 --> 43:45.421
All at once or slow?

43:45.423 --> 43:47.156
- Hmmm?
- Slow.

43:51.229 --> 43:53.229
Fuck!

43:53.231 --> 43:55.331
What did you mean
when you told Dr. shapiro

43:55.333 --> 43:58.968
that Nina wanted cori
to be sick?

43:58.970 --> 44:01.838
She was...
Inventing illnesses for cori

44:01.840 --> 44:05.308
to make him go through all these
unnecessary medical procedures,

44:05.310 --> 44:09.278
giving him medications
that were making him sick.

44:09.280 --> 44:12.081
She was poisoning my son.

44:12.083 --> 44:17.020
She didn't like him
on some deep, conflicted level.

44:17.022 --> 44:18.621
<i> I know people</i>
<i> don't want to hear that.</i>

44:18.623 --> 44:20.823
<i> I mean, they can't believe</i>

44:20.825 --> 44:24.060
<i> that a parent would</i>
<i> actually hurt a child.</i>

44:25.763 --> 44:28.498
<i> It happens all the time.</i>

44:28.500 --> 44:31.167
The court system-- I mean,
it just makes things

44:31.169 --> 44:34.937
so much worse for the children.

44:34.939 --> 44:37.173
<i> We're taught to believe</i>
<i> that the system</i>

44:37.175 --> 44:39.275
<i> will actually help the child,</i>

44:39.277 --> 44:41.477
<i> that it'll do the right thing,</i>

44:41.479 --> 44:44.614
but it doesn't always.

44:46.050 --> 44:47.784
<i> Sometimes</i>
<i> it does the opposite.</i>

44:49.386 --> 44:51.554
<i> I was betrayed and abandoned</i>

44:51.556 --> 44:55.825
by the people that I was
supposed to trust blindly.

44:55.827 --> 44:58.628
When I fought back,
they called me a liar.

45:00.731 --> 45:02.899
<i> No one tells you what</i>
<i> you're supposed to do then.</i>

45:07.237 --> 45:09.906
<i> When you're all alone,</i>

45:09.908 --> 45:13.810
<i> you have to take matters</i>
<i> into your own hands.</i>

45:13.812 --> 45:17.714
<i> If you understand that,</i>
<i> you understand everything.</i>

45:17.716 --> 45:20.583
<i> I always tried to do</i>
<i> the right thing,</i>

45:22.553 --> 45:25.788
even if it was
an impossible decision.

45:33.664 --> 45:34.797
Hey.

45:43.373 --> 45:45.174
You okay?

45:45.176 --> 45:47.110
Yeah.

45:57.755 --> 46:00.423
What is that?

46:00.425 --> 46:03.126
It's Adderall,
klonopin, Vicodin.

46:07.731 --> 46:09.465
Can I have one?

46:44.935 --> 46:46.569
Lana:
<i> I hate feeling trapped.</i>

46:48.505 --> 46:50.039
Stephen:
<i> I'd never want to trap you.</i>

46:52.342 --> 46:53.643
<i> You can tell me</i>
<i> whatever you want.</i>

46:57.147 --> 46:59.148
<i> You know that, right?</i>

46:59.150 --> 47:00.416
Lana:
<i> I know.</i>

47:16.967 --> 47:18.434
Choke me.

47:20.337 --> 47:22.471
Now?

47:22.473 --> 47:23.539
Yeah.

47:27.611 --> 47:31.013
I don't... I just --

47:33.618 --> 47:36.786
I don't really
feel like that now.

47:36.788 --> 47:38.888
Stephen:
Hey.

47:38.890 --> 47:41.390
I don't want you to do anything
that you don't want to do.

47:43.493 --> 47:45.795
Come here.
Come back.

47:51.568 --> 47:55.338
I just feel at home
with you, so...

47:55.340 --> 47:57.173
I just don't wanna
have to pretend, or...

47:57.175 --> 48:00.643
<i> And I don't want you</i>
<i> to have to pretend anything.</i>

48:18.162 --> 48:20.830
- Just like that?
- Yeah, squeeze.

48:20.832 --> 48:22.498
Right here?

48:22.500 --> 48:24.767
Harder. Harder.

48:26.937 --> 48:28.704
You can't go harder?

48:28.706 --> 48:29.939
I'm trying.

48:31.576 --> 48:32.975
I mean, look.
Come here.

48:39.850 --> 48:41.183
Put your hands there.

48:45.188 --> 48:47.857
- Yeah?
- All right.

48:47.859 --> 48:49.592
- Like that?
-<i> Yeah.</i>

48:49.594 --> 48:54.030
Okay. Now I want you
to press as hard as you can.

48:55.265 --> 48:58.968
It's okay. Just let it out.

48:58.970 --> 49:02.371
Everything he did to you,
i want you to take it out.

49:02.373 --> 49:06.976
Just take it out on me
right now. Do it now.

49:06.978 --> 49:09.245
<i>Do it harder.</i>

49:09.247 --> 49:11.547
Harder. Harder.

49:12.917 --> 49:16.352
Harder.
Harder.

49:44.247 --> 49:48.351
Stephen! Stephen!

49:48.353 --> 49:50.619
Stephen, wake up!

49:50.621 --> 49:52.455
Stephen!

49:55.793 --> 49:58.461
Stephen, please, wake up!

49:58.463 --> 49:59.962
Stephen!

50:13.477 --> 50:14.677
Oh, my god.

50:22.285 --> 50:25.187
- Oh, my god!
- Are you okay?

50:32.295 --> 50:33.763
I love you.

50:35.665 --> 50:37.066
What'd you say?

50:37.068 --> 50:38.401
I love you.

50:44.174 --> 50:46.075
What?

50:46.077 --> 50:49.178
- I can't do this.
- It's okay.

50:49.180 --> 50:52.481
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

50:52.483 --> 50:55.051
Stephen, I can't do this!

50:55.053 --> 50:57.153
It's okay.

52:30.247 --> 52:32.014
Lana:
<i> Steven.</i>

52:32.016 --> 52:35.151
<i> Please, you have to</i>
<i> stop calling me.</i>

52:35.153 --> 52:37.453
<i> I don't wanna talk to you.</i>

52:37.455 --> 52:39.355
<i> I mean it.</i>

52:39.357 --> 52:40.422
<i> Bye.</i>

52:48.965 --> 52:51.100
Jen:
<i> Steve,</i>
<i> I just had a meeting</i>

52:51.102 --> 52:54.170
<i> with your publisher,</i>
<i> maybe you remember them.</i>

52:54.172 --> 52:56.005
<i> We waited three hours...</i>

52:56.007 --> 52:57.506
<i> For you.</i>

52:57.508 --> 52:59.341
<i> Um, the bottom line is</i>

52:59.343 --> 53:02.511
<i> penguin does not want</i>
<i> this true crime bullshit,</i>

53:02.513 --> 53:04.480
<i> like I told you,</i>

53:04.482 --> 53:06.882
<i> and they're pulling out</i>
<i> of the original project, too.</i>

53:06.884 --> 53:09.018
Oh, fuck!

53:09.020 --> 53:10.686
<i> You have seven days</i>
<i> to return the advance,</i>

53:10.688 --> 53:12.621
<i> and there's nothing else</i>
<i> I can do.</i>

53:12.623 --> 53:15.824
<i> And you need a new editor</i>
<i>because you no longer have one.</i>

53:15.826 --> 53:17.826
<i> I really hope you're able</i>
<i> to get your shit together.</i>

53:17.828 --> 53:19.295
Fuck you!

53:22.165 --> 53:24.366
<i> Hey,</i>
<i> it's Josh, where are you?</i>

53:24.368 --> 53:26.202
<i> I'm trying to save your seat,</i>
<i> but these people are crazy.</i>

53:26.204 --> 53:27.536
<i> Call me.</i>

53:27.538 --> 53:29.572
Shit!

53:35.512 --> 53:36.879
Judge:
<i> Have you reached a verdict?</i>

53:36.881 --> 53:38.380
Woman:
<i> We have, your honor.</i>

53:38.382 --> 53:40.049
<i>The defendant will rise.</i>

53:42.052 --> 53:43.719
<i>Proceed.</i>

53:43.721 --> 53:45.354
Woman: <i> We the jury</i>
<i> find the defendant</i>

53:45.356 --> 53:48.324
<i> guilty of murder</i>
<i> in the first degree.</i>

53:58.768 --> 54:01.837
Woman:
<i> We the jury find</i>
<i> the defendant guilty of murder</i>

54:01.839 --> 54:03.339
<i> in the first degree.</i>

54:03.341 --> 54:05.107
<i> On or about December 1...</i>

54:05.109 --> 54:08.644
- Hey, can I watch this?
-<i> Yeah, sure.</i>

54:10.880 --> 54:12.948
<i> Bailiff,</i>
<i> remove Mr. Reiser</i>

54:12.950 --> 54:14.550
<i> from the courtroom, please.</i>

54:14.552 --> 54:15.718
<i> Thank you.</i>

54:15.720 --> 54:17.720
<i> Wait, take your hands off me.</i>

54:17.722 --> 54:19.521
<i> Wait! I just wanted to say</i>
<i> that I was the best father</i>

54:19.523 --> 54:21.190
<i> that I knew how to be.</i>

54:21.192 --> 54:24.460
<i> I only tried</i>
<i> to protect my children!</i>

54:24.462 --> 54:26.562
<i> Take your hands off me.</i>

54:26.564 --> 54:29.398
<i> I wanted to be the best father</i>
<i> that I could be.</i>

54:29.400 --> 54:31.300
Thanks.

54:36.373 --> 54:39.141
Oh, wow!
Remember this?

54:39.143 --> 54:40.476
Oh!

54:40.478 --> 54:41.910
- Remember that mustang?
- Yep.

54:41.912 --> 54:43.712
Shit,
that was an awesome car!

54:43.714 --> 54:46.749
Yeah.

54:46.751 --> 54:47.983
Neil Elliott graduated

54:47.985 --> 54:49.752
from the university
of natal.

54:49.754 --> 54:51.754
Served as an airborne
meteorologist

54:51.756 --> 54:53.489
with the south African
air force,

54:53.491 --> 54:56.058
<i>worked as a geologist</i>
<i>for two years</i>

54:56.060 --> 54:58.360
<i>before immigrating</i>
<i>to the United States.</i>

54:59.763 --> 55:02.064
What the fuck is this?

55:02.066 --> 55:04.500
Guess he wrote a few books
before I was born.

55:06.137 --> 55:09.171
<i> You know what hans said</i>
<i> after the verdict?</i>

55:09.173 --> 55:11.173
<i> After the verdict?</i>

55:11.175 --> 55:14.743
"I tried to be the best father
i knew how to be."

55:14.745 --> 55:17.179
<i> That's exactly what</i>
<i> my dad fuckin' said.</i>

55:17.181 --> 55:19.982
<i> I mean, can you</i>
<i> fuckin' believe that?</i>

55:19.984 --> 55:22.117
<i>I wanted to tell you</i>
<i>I saw your dad the other day</i>

55:22.119 --> 55:24.620
at the hospital
when I was makin' my rounds.

55:24.622 --> 55:26.588
<i> Why was he at the hospital?</i>

55:26.590 --> 55:28.424
<i>I don't know, but he was.</i>

55:30.327 --> 55:33.429
My dad and hans
are fuckin' delusional.

55:33.431 --> 55:35.097
"The best father
i knew how to be"--

55:35.099 --> 55:37.833
what the fuck,
like it was all my fault?

55:37.835 --> 55:39.001
All this?

55:41.037 --> 55:42.204
What?

55:42.206 --> 55:43.639
Of the hans thing,

55:43.641 --> 55:45.140
of the trial,
of all that was

55:45.142 --> 55:47.843
so that you could write
about something different.

55:47.845 --> 55:49.812
So what?
Back to me.

55:49.814 --> 55:52.815
You know what
he fuckin' said,

55:52.817 --> 55:54.216
"i didn't have the right
context."

55:54.218 --> 55:56.819
The right
fucking context?

55:56.821 --> 56:00.522
He said I terrorized
his new family.

56:00.524 --> 56:02.024
Terrorized!

56:02.026 --> 56:04.626
Terrorized is a bad word.
It's not a good word.

56:04.628 --> 56:07.029
You think there's a better
word that describes it?

56:09.532 --> 56:10.666
No. I'm sayin' I've been...

56:10.668 --> 56:12.501
I've, I've thought about it.

56:12.503 --> 56:14.136
I don't have
a good feelin' about it.

56:14.138 --> 56:16.305
I feel like maybe
we fucked his kids up.

56:16.307 --> 56:18.574
Are you serious? How?

56:18.576 --> 56:20.843
Because they saw us so
out of control all the time.

56:20.845 --> 56:22.344
We weren't out of control.

56:22.346 --> 56:24.980
- Yeah, we were.
- No, we weren't.

56:24.982 --> 56:27.049
Name one time.

56:27.051 --> 56:28.317
Want me to name one time?

56:30.653 --> 56:32.721
How about that-- one time?

56:32.723 --> 56:35.524
You totaled his mustang
in front of the kids.

56:35.526 --> 56:37.893
Now that had to be
terrifying for them.

56:37.895 --> 56:40.229
Are you seriously trying to
make me feel bad about that?

56:40.231 --> 56:42.197
No. All right,

56:42.199 --> 56:45.100
you get the award for the
shittiest father ever, right?

56:45.102 --> 56:47.269
But now you can see him
from a whole new perspective

56:47.271 --> 56:50.572
if you want to,
from an adult perspective,
like a real adult.

56:50.574 --> 56:54.009
A real adult like Roger?
That would be better?

56:54.011 --> 56:55.210
I didn't say
it would be better.

56:55.212 --> 56:56.879
No, I didn't say that.

56:56.881 --> 57:00.549
What did you say--
that we both started
in the same place

57:00.551 --> 57:03.051
and I ended up here
and you ended up...

57:03.053 --> 57:04.553
What, getting everything good?

57:04.555 --> 57:06.388
A wife, kids, all that?

57:06.390 --> 57:07.523
Yeah, hell yeah.

57:07.525 --> 57:09.024
Yeah, I like being a father.

57:09.026 --> 57:10.025
I like it.

57:10.027 --> 57:12.060
Well, your dick works.

57:12.062 --> 57:14.763
That's great.
Congratulations, man.

57:14.765 --> 57:17.866
- You're livin'
the fuckin' dream.
- How about fuck you, Stephen?

57:17.868 --> 57:19.802
How about that?
'Cause every time you get
in some shitty little way,

57:19.804 --> 57:21.403
you just grab me
and try to drag me

57:21.405 --> 57:22.404
right through it,
so fuck you.

57:22.406 --> 57:23.405
Oh, man.
You know what,

57:23.407 --> 57:25.607
you wanted
to be a rock star,

57:25.609 --> 57:28.210
<i>and now you fuckin'</i>
<i>buy happy meals.</i>

57:28.212 --> 57:30.879
I mean, they're gonna name
mountains after you--

57:30.881 --> 57:33.882
fuckin' mount
i-played-it-fuckin'-safe.

57:33.884 --> 57:36.585
Look at you.
You're exactly like
your fuckin' father.

57:36.587 --> 57:39.221
Exactly like him!
You're sittin' here,
you're pouting and whining.

57:39.223 --> 57:42.057
You're fuckin' spinnin' out,
and you're destroying
your own life,

57:42.059 --> 57:45.594
and it's everybody else's
fuckin' fault. So fuck
you, man,

57:45.596 --> 57:47.596
and don't come around
my family anymore either.

57:47.598 --> 57:48.831
I don't want you
comin' around them no more.

57:48.833 --> 57:52.267
Oh, seriously?

57:52.269 --> 57:53.635
I don't wanna be
around your...

57:53.637 --> 57:56.205
...fuckin' family.

58:48.324 --> 58:51.360
Man:
<i> The charge</i>
<i> is knocked down to murder ii,</i>

58:51.362 --> 58:52.594
<i> with chance of parole.</i>

58:55.131 --> 58:56.665
<i> If you produce a body,</i>
<i> you have a deal--</i>

58:56.667 --> 59:00.068
<i> murder ii,</i>
<i> no chance of parole.</i>

59:02.338 --> 59:06.742
<i> I didn't want to</i>
<i> kill Nina, but I did.</i>

59:06.744 --> 59:09.478
<i> She was leaving me</i>
<i> for another man.</i>

59:09.480 --> 59:12.381
<i> I was devastated,</i>
<i> lost control.</i>

59:17.053 --> 59:20.322
<i> She said</i>

59:20.324 --> 59:22.457
<i> she had never loved me.</i>

59:25.862 --> 59:30.465
<i> That she only</i>
<i> married me to escape Russia.</i>

59:32.835 --> 59:35.571
<i> I took her neck in my hands...</i>

59:38.608 --> 59:41.910
<i> And I crushed it until</i>
<i> I felt her throat collapse.</i>

59:43.279 --> 59:45.747
<i> That was it.</i>

59:45.749 --> 59:48.684
<i> All the anger,</i>
<i> all the hatred.</i>

59:48.686 --> 59:50.619
<i> There was just silence.</i>

59:55.558 --> 59:59.428
Lana, can I talk to you?

59:59.430 --> 01:00:01.363
Hey.

01:00:01.365 --> 01:00:02.364
- I'm sorry.
- Don't touch me!

01:00:02.366 --> 01:00:03.432
Sorry.

01:00:05.468 --> 01:00:06.802
Can I please just...

01:00:06.804 --> 01:00:08.236
- Please?
- Talk to Roger.

01:00:08.238 --> 01:00:09.771
If you need someone to talk to.

01:00:09.773 --> 01:00:11.473
Well, he's not answering
my calls either.

01:00:11.475 --> 01:00:14.142
Please? I feel like I'm about
to go underwater, okay?

01:00:14.144 --> 01:00:18.647
Can I just...
Please talk to you...

01:00:18.649 --> 01:00:20.716
Please?

01:00:20.718 --> 01:00:24.486
You're the only person
that's made me feel
okay about myself...

01:00:24.488 --> 01:00:28.557
In my entire adult life,
and I feel like I know you.

01:00:28.559 --> 01:00:32.394
From the first second
i met you, I felt that.

01:00:37.166 --> 01:00:39.434
I know it feels that way,

01:00:39.436 --> 01:00:40.769
but maybe that's
not a good thing.

01:00:40.771 --> 01:00:42.404
Why?

01:00:42.406 --> 01:00:45.440
Because you're gonna
take me down with you.

01:00:45.442 --> 01:00:47.442
It's just who you are.

01:00:47.444 --> 01:00:50.479
Look, I'm fucked up, okay?

01:00:50.481 --> 01:00:52.848
Is that gonna be your excuse
for the rest of your life?

01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:55.817
That you're too broken not
to be completely selfish?

01:00:55.819 --> 01:00:57.486
Grow some fucking balls!

01:01:01.824 --> 01:01:05.627
At least I'm not pretending
nothing's wrong with me.

01:01:05.629 --> 01:01:09.264
Oh, you're pretending plenty.

01:01:09.266 --> 01:01:10.499
You just don't see it.

01:01:13.102 --> 01:01:15.437
Here's those papers you wanted.

01:01:15.439 --> 01:01:17.539
<i>They're pretty enlightening.</i>

01:02:15.431 --> 01:02:18.567
Neil on TV:
<i> Okay, you ready for a ride?</i>
<i> Hop on my back.</i>

01:02:18.569 --> 01:02:21.870
<i> Come on, man.</i>
<i> See if you can stay on.</i>
<i> You ready?</i>

01:02:21.872 --> 01:02:24.106
<i> You gotta hold on.</i>
<i> Put your legs around me.</i>

01:02:24.108 --> 01:02:25.407
<i> Hold tight.</i>
<i> Ready?</i>

01:02:25.409 --> 01:02:26.708
<i> Yeah!</i>

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:39.855
<i> You're the one who should be</i>
<i> in front of the camera.</i>

01:02:39.857 --> 01:02:41.590
<i> What are you doin'</i>
<i> hidin' back there?</i>

01:02:43.259 --> 01:02:45.093
<i> There she is,</i>
<i> ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:02:45.095 --> 01:02:47.262
<i> the most beautiful woman</i>
<i> in the world.</i>

01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:50.132
<i> Just like out of a fairy tale.</i>

01:02:50.134 --> 01:02:53.468
Do you remember her like that?

01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:54.669
Not much.

01:02:58.574 --> 01:03:01.543
<i> She really was the most</i>
<i> beautiful woman I ever saw.</i>

01:03:01.545 --> 01:03:03.779
<i> Wave to daddy .</i>

01:03:03.781 --> 01:03:07.215
<i> I was your age then,</i>
<i> right before</i>
<i> you went to Chicago,</i>

01:03:07.217 --> 01:03:08.617
and when she died...

01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:13.722
Man, I was so confused
i couldn't stop screamin'.

01:03:13.724 --> 01:03:15.056
Yeah, I remember.

01:03:21.731 --> 01:03:23.899
You want coffee?

01:03:23.901 --> 01:03:25.100
What?

01:03:25.102 --> 01:03:26.802
Coffee.

01:03:26.804 --> 01:03:29.137
No! What the fuck
are you doing?

01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:32.174
- Just waiting.
- No.

01:03:32.176 --> 01:03:34.476
Dad, you broke into my house.

01:03:34.478 --> 01:03:37.012
What the fuck?

01:03:37.014 --> 01:03:40.816
Well, I wanted to
give you somethin'.

01:03:40.818 --> 01:03:42.317
Jesus. I can't...

01:03:42.319 --> 01:03:43.752
I can't deal with this
right now.

01:03:46.088 --> 01:03:49.491
I'm tryin' to
apologize to you...

01:03:49.493 --> 01:03:51.626
Before it's too late.

01:03:51.628 --> 01:03:53.461
What does that mean?

01:03:53.463 --> 01:03:57.132
I had a bunch of tests done.

01:03:57.134 --> 01:03:58.600
I'm dying.

01:03:58.602 --> 01:03:59.968
Don't fuckin' lie to me!

01:03:59.970 --> 01:04:02.637
Will you just fuckin'
listen to me?

01:04:02.639 --> 01:04:04.606
I'm a sick man.

01:04:04.608 --> 01:04:07.442
I wanted to come see you,
make amends with my son.

01:04:07.444 --> 01:04:08.944
- Amends?
- Yeah.

01:04:08.946 --> 01:04:10.512
What amends
are you making?

01:04:10.514 --> 01:04:13.548
You're such a martyr.

01:04:13.550 --> 01:04:16.284
God, you always have been.
What kid is like that?

01:04:16.286 --> 01:04:18.520
Think the world
owes you somethin'.

01:04:18.522 --> 01:04:22.023
- Look, dad, I'm exhausted.
- A lot of people
look at your life

01:04:22.025 --> 01:04:23.491
and think it would be
pretty good, you know.

01:04:23.493 --> 01:04:25.293
<i>The New York times</i>
reviews, pretty girls,

01:04:25.295 --> 01:04:27.028
everybody kissin' your ass
to be around a hot shit writer.

01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:28.396
Well, I can kiss all that
good-bye

01:04:28.398 --> 01:04:29.965
'cause everything good
in my life

01:04:29.967 --> 01:04:32.400
just disappeared
as soon as you showed up!

01:04:32.402 --> 01:04:34.836
You wanna blame me?
That's easy.

01:04:34.838 --> 01:04:37.472
And what are all the good things
in your life that fell apart...

01:04:37.474 --> 01:04:38.707
What do they all have
in common?

01:04:38.709 --> 01:04:40.308
- Here we go!
- Yeah, you!

01:04:40.310 --> 01:04:42.344
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>you're a fuckin' curse.</i>

01:04:42.346 --> 01:04:43.678
<i>You're poison.</i>

01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:45.914
You know, everything you touch
you fuck up.

01:04:47.717 --> 01:04:50.051
Just get out of my house!

01:04:52.321 --> 01:04:53.388
All right.

01:04:56.592 --> 01:04:59.694
- Look, I made this for you.
- Get out!

01:04:59.696 --> 01:05:00.695
Just promise me
that you'll look at it.

01:05:00.697 --> 01:05:02.264
Get out!

01:05:02.266 --> 01:05:04.065
- Did you see this...
- Get out of my house!

01:05:04.067 --> 01:05:05.433
I will get out of your house,

01:05:05.435 --> 01:05:07.702
but you just see for yourself,
all right?

01:05:07.704 --> 01:05:10.272
I don't
fuckin' have to look at it!

01:05:10.274 --> 01:05:12.007
<i>You fuckin' hit your father.</i>

01:05:15.211 --> 01:05:16.711
What, you wanna fight me, boy?

01:05:16.713 --> 01:05:18.513
Fucking fight an old man.

01:05:18.515 --> 01:05:19.614
Who the fuck do you think
you're talkin' to?

01:05:19.616 --> 01:05:20.815
I'll ruin you!

01:05:22.051 --> 01:05:23.385
Come on.

01:05:23.387 --> 01:05:25.220
Huh? Come on!
Fuckin' pussy.

01:05:25.222 --> 01:05:27.188
Huh?
You fuckin' faggot.

01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:31.293
Huh?
You waste of a life!
Come on, hit me!

01:05:31.295 --> 01:05:34.095
You wanna kill me so bad,
hit me. Come on. Hit me.

01:05:34.097 --> 01:05:35.897
I deserve it. Come on.
Fight me, fight me!

01:05:35.899 --> 01:05:37.699
Hit me! Hit me! Come on!

01:05:37.701 --> 01:05:39.100
Hit me!!!

01:05:42.271 --> 01:05:43.338
Oh, fuck!

01:05:46.275 --> 01:05:48.109
- Fuck you!
- Call 911.

01:05:48.111 --> 01:05:50.645
Oh, fuck you!
I'm not fuckin' buyin' it!

01:05:56.752 --> 01:05:58.553
Ah, Stephen!

01:06:05.161 --> 01:06:07.395
All right, all right,
all right.

01:06:07.397 --> 01:06:12.033
I'm a terrible father.
I'm a terrible father.

01:07:51.867 --> 01:07:54.102
<i> Hi, Stephen.</i>

01:07:54.104 --> 01:07:56.237
<i> I-- I don't know</i>
<i> if I'm ever gonna, you know,</i>

01:07:56.239 --> 01:07:58.940
<i> get a chance</i>
<i> to see you again,</i>

01:07:58.942 --> 01:08:01.676
<i> and even if I do,</i>

01:08:01.678 --> 01:08:03.845
<i> we were never so good</i>
<i> at communicating.</i>

01:08:03.847 --> 01:08:06.181
<i> So...</i>

01:08:06.183 --> 01:08:08.516
<i> Well, there are some things</i>
<i> I wanna tell you, so...</i>

01:08:08.518 --> 01:08:10.618
<i> That's why I'm doing this.</i>

01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:12.087
<i> You know, that story you tell</i>

01:08:12.089 --> 01:08:14.022
<i> about the time</i>
<i> I shaved your head</i>

01:08:14.024 --> 01:08:17.058
<i> and I restrained you,</i>

01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:21.229
<i> was actually</i>
<i> two different times.</i>

01:08:21.231 --> 01:08:25.767
<i> The first time you were</i>
<i> squatting at the house.</i>

01:08:25.769 --> 01:08:29.136
<i> It had been empty for a year,</i>

01:08:29.139 --> 01:08:33.640
<i> and I needed that money</i>
<i> so badly.</i>

01:08:33.643 --> 01:08:35.376
<i> I finally found a buyer,</i>

01:08:35.377 --> 01:08:37.946
<i> and I had to show</i>
<i> the house once more</i>

01:08:37.948 --> 01:08:40.548
<i> before the deal closed.</i>

01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:44.919
<i> I got there,</i>
<i> and you trashed the place.</i>

01:08:44.921 --> 01:08:48.389
<i> Thousands of dollars</i>
<i> in damage,</i>

01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:53.161
<i> and I was so angry that</i>
<i> I hit you and I cut your hair.</i>

01:08:53.162 --> 01:08:57.932
<i> You know, afterwards you were</i>
<i> crying in the bathtub.</i>

01:08:57.934 --> 01:08:59.834
<i> It was really horrible.</i>

01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:10.011
The second time...

01:09:10.013 --> 01:09:14.482
I did it to try to stop you
from killin' yourself.

01:09:14.484 --> 01:09:16.350
<i> You were livin' on the street</i>

01:09:16.353 --> 01:09:18.319
<i> and I came upon you</i>
<i> sittin' outside an arcade</i>

01:09:18.321 --> 01:09:20.121
<i> and I asked you</i>
<i> what was up, you know,</i>

01:09:20.122 --> 01:09:21.823
<i> what your plans were,</i>
<i> and you said well,</i>

01:09:21.825 --> 01:09:23.892
<i> I guess,</i>
<i> I'll just commit suicide.</i>

01:09:27.296 --> 01:09:29.197
<i> I had to go to work,</i>

01:09:29.198 --> 01:09:30.965
and I didn't know
what the hell to do.

01:09:30.966 --> 01:09:32.700
I took you back
to the empty house

01:09:32.702 --> 01:09:36.437
and then you really
got out of control.

01:09:36.439 --> 01:09:39.107
<i> You know, you were trying to</i>
<i> cut your wrists open, so I...</i>

01:09:39.109 --> 01:09:42.143
<i> I handcuffed you</i>
<i> to this radiator pipe</i>

01:09:42.145 --> 01:09:43.877
<i> while I tried to, you know,</i>

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:46.881
<i> reach my own decision</i>
<i> whether to call the cops</i>

01:09:46.883 --> 01:09:49.884
<i> or if that would put you</i>
<i> in jail.</i>

01:09:51.554 --> 01:09:53.321
Thirty minutes later,

01:09:53.323 --> 01:09:56.991
I came back to check on you
and you were hanging there,

01:09:56.993 --> 01:10:00.461
passed out in a puddle
of blood at your feet,

01:10:00.463 --> 01:10:02.397
and I thought you were dead.

01:10:02.399 --> 01:10:06.367
<i> It was like a bolt</i>
<i> of lightning hit my heart.</i>

01:10:08.170 --> 01:10:12.140
<i> I just couldn't bear</i>
<i> the thought of livin'</i>

01:10:12.142 --> 01:10:14.242
<i> knowin' what I'd done to you.</i>

01:10:17.479 --> 01:10:20.982
Part of me I don't think

01:10:20.984 --> 01:10:23.551
ever came back from that moment.

01:10:23.553 --> 01:10:25.320
<i> I took the handcuffs off you</i>

01:10:25.322 --> 01:10:27.422
<i> and I said,</i>

01:10:27.424 --> 01:10:29.824
<i> "you do whatever</i>
<i> you wanna do, son."</i>

01:10:31.694 --> 01:10:34.395
<i> You didn't want anything</i>
<i> to do with me.</i>

01:10:34.397 --> 01:10:35.964
<i> I can't blame you for that.</i>

01:10:38.567 --> 01:10:42.570
I keep tryin'
to apologize to you,

01:10:42.572 --> 01:10:45.707
but it all goes wrong.

01:10:45.709 --> 01:10:49.277
<i> Maybe there just isn't a way</i>
<i> to make amends</i>

01:10:49.279 --> 01:10:52.914
<i> for somethin' like this.</i>

01:10:52.916 --> 01:10:57.452
<i> Not that it matters,</i>
<i> but honestly, i--</i>

01:10:57.454 --> 01:10:59.854
<i> I only ever tried</i>
<i> to do right by you.</i>

01:11:04.927 --> 01:11:08.596
<i> I'm a broken man,</i>

01:11:08.598 --> 01:11:11.099
<i> and I just...</i>

01:11:11.101 --> 01:11:13.167
<i> I hope you won't be like me.</i>

01:11:25.781 --> 01:11:27.448
Fuck!

01:11:44.566 --> 01:11:46.267
Roger:
<i> Could you ask me</i>
<i> some questions?</i>

01:11:46.269 --> 01:11:50.305
<i> I'm not good at</i>
<i> making speeches.</i>

01:11:50.307 --> 01:11:53.408
Did you think you had
a chance at a better verdict?

01:11:53.410 --> 01:11:56.844
Look, I knew I wasn't
gonna get away with it.

01:11:56.846 --> 01:12:00.014
I mean, I looked guilty,

01:12:00.016 --> 01:12:02.083
I am guilty,

01:12:02.085 --> 01:12:06.020
but a father does
what he has to do

01:12:06.022 --> 01:12:09.924
in order to protect
his children.

01:12:09.926 --> 01:12:12.293
Okay. Um...

01:12:12.295 --> 01:12:14.429
If you knew that you weren't
going for innocence,

01:12:14.431 --> 01:12:16.664
then why didn't you just
plead guilty in the beginning

01:12:16.666 --> 01:12:18.466
and get a deal?

01:12:18.468 --> 01:12:20.702
I mean, I heard Dubois
made a deal for seven years

01:12:20.704 --> 01:12:22.136
because the da
didn't wanna go to court.

01:12:22.138 --> 01:12:24.205
But who would've cared?

01:12:24.207 --> 01:12:26.374
<i>I had the most publicized</i>
<i>trial in years.</i>

01:12:26.376 --> 01:12:28.109
Would you be interested
in following the story

01:12:28.111 --> 01:12:30.611
of a murderer
who took a plea bargain?

01:12:30.613 --> 01:12:33.448
But I thought you said
you did it for your children.

01:12:33.450 --> 01:12:36.117
I did. Everything I've
ever done was for them.

01:12:36.119 --> 01:12:39.721
But you insured that
you would never see them again.

01:12:39.723 --> 01:12:41.389
I mean, they're not
gonna have a father.

01:12:41.391 --> 01:12:43.558
I don't...

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:44.692
I don't know.

01:12:44.694 --> 01:12:45.693
I don't know
what to tell you.

01:12:45.695 --> 01:12:48.129
Validation
is a helluva drug.

01:12:51.401 --> 01:12:52.800
What? What's funny?

01:12:59.376 --> 01:13:01.542
Just the truth's
a motherfucker.

01:13:06.081 --> 01:13:09.050
Thanks.
I'll see you.

01:16:13.902 --> 01:16:16.003
So you wrote all that
in two days?

01:16:16.005 --> 01:16:17.838
Yeah, I mean, I put it
down on paper in two days,

01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:20.541
but I mean, this is the book
that I've...

01:16:20.543 --> 01:16:22.009
I've been wanting to write.

01:16:22.011 --> 01:16:25.746
I just didn't know that until...
Until now.

01:16:28.183 --> 01:16:30.384
So let's find you a publisher.

01:16:30.386 --> 01:16:31.953
It's not going to be penguin,

01:16:31.955 --> 01:16:34.522
but I've got
a friend at grey wolf

01:16:34.524 --> 01:16:36.791
I think would be
into this idea.

01:16:36.793 --> 01:16:38.259
It won't be a big advance,

01:16:38.261 --> 01:16:41.796
but something to get us
back on track.

01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:44.498
Us?

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:48.002
Us.

01:16:58.046 --> 01:16:59.347
Hey.

01:17:02.584 --> 01:17:03.818
Brought you some coffee.

01:17:13.729 --> 01:17:15.763
I'm in no mood, Elliott.

01:17:15.765 --> 01:17:18.499
That was your decaf.

01:17:18.501 --> 01:17:20.201
You can have my coffee,
if you want.

01:17:25.307 --> 01:17:27.742
I also brought you
some blueberries.

01:17:27.744 --> 01:17:31.345
So many gifts
and so few actual apologies.

01:17:31.347 --> 01:17:32.713
I don't know where to start.

01:17:34.583 --> 01:17:36.217
Start with
the hydrangeas.

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:46.761
And for the record--no.

01:17:46.763 --> 01:17:49.530
It's not my life's plan
to be watering these things.

01:17:51.466 --> 01:17:54.802
I feed them bone meal
so they stay blue.

01:17:54.804 --> 01:17:56.270
She loves it, so.

01:17:57.973 --> 01:18:01.375
I'd be doin' this
if I had the chance.

01:18:01.377 --> 01:18:03.177
I'd be doin' all of this.

01:18:07.516 --> 01:18:10.317
Sorry, Roger.

01:18:10.319 --> 01:18:13.654
I'm a pretty shitty person.

01:18:13.656 --> 01:18:16.057
No, you're not.

01:18:16.059 --> 01:18:17.625
You're my family.

01:18:20.462 --> 01:18:24.899
You-- you knew me when
i was the messiest kid
out of all of us.

01:18:24.901 --> 01:18:28.335
You never gave me any grief
about that, not once.

01:18:28.337 --> 01:18:31.305
You kept showin' up for me.
So...

01:18:33.675 --> 01:18:37.311
I'm not gonna walk away
from this over a few words.

01:18:42.384 --> 01:18:43.918
You wanna go for a ride?

01:18:46.321 --> 01:18:47.588
You're all wet.

01:18:50.492 --> 01:18:53.227
Yeah. We can even that up.

01:18:55.063 --> 01:18:57.865
- Bitch.
- Sorry, it just slipped.

01:18:57.867 --> 01:18:59.366
- Oh, that slipped?
- Yeah.

01:18:59.368 --> 01:19:01.235
Motherfucker!
What are you doin', dude?

01:19:01.237 --> 01:19:03.104
Don't, don't, don't, don't!

01:19:03.106 --> 01:19:05.573
<i> Nina's mother Christina says</i>
<i> she is relieved</i>

01:19:05.575 --> 01:19:07.541
<i> the children may come</i>
<i> to some sense of closure...</i>

01:19:07.543 --> 01:19:10.711
What time is it?

01:19:10.713 --> 01:19:13.714
We have about an hour.
Your flight's at 6:00.

01:19:13.716 --> 01:19:16.951
We should pull
the rental car around.

01:19:16.953 --> 01:19:18.352
<i> I already did.</i>

01:19:18.354 --> 01:19:19.854
You know you're not drivin'.

01:19:19.856 --> 01:19:22.723
Oh, great!
You can kill us both.

01:19:26.362 --> 01:19:29.196
You remember
when you taught me to drive?

01:19:29.198 --> 01:19:31.565
I was 14.

01:19:31.567 --> 01:19:35.202
You let me drive out to
Warren park in a '69 mustang.

01:19:36.972 --> 01:19:39.440
<i> I loved that car.</i>

01:19:39.442 --> 01:19:42.777
<i> You used to take me out,</i>
<i> let me drive.</i>

01:19:42.779 --> 01:19:46.313
<i> I remember feelin'</i>
<i> so happy and free,</i>

01:19:46.315 --> 01:19:49.650
<i> full of hope and potential.</i>

01:19:49.652 --> 01:19:51.218
Neil:
<i>I don't know why</i>
<i>you always told people</i>

01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:54.421
<i>I taught you to drive</i>
<i>in the mustang.</i>

01:19:54.423 --> 01:19:59.393
It was a red 1968
oldsmobile delmont convertible

01:19:59.395 --> 01:20:02.496
in Warren park
in the parkin' lot.

01:20:02.498 --> 01:20:06.901
You were belligerent,
and you were a terrible driver.

01:20:06.903 --> 01:20:08.669
So we only did it once.

01:20:10.172 --> 01:20:11.605
Wanna go for a drive?

01:20:11.607 --> 01:20:12.740
I don't wanna
see you for an hour.

01:20:12.742 --> 01:20:14.575
Nah, we'd just argue.

01:20:14.577 --> 01:20:16.177
Fine.
Then we'll just go.

01:20:16.179 --> 01:20:19.113
We'll agree not to talk.
It doesn't matter.

01:20:19.115 --> 01:20:20.514
None of it matters.

01:20:20.516 --> 01:20:24.752
All right.
You gotta help me up here.

01:20:24.754 --> 01:20:26.654
Help your old dad get up.

01:20:27.305 --> 01:20:33.548
