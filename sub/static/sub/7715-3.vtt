I auditioned for this!
When did the cast list go up?

01:33.772 --> 01:35.606
Like a month ago.

01:35.674 --> 01:37.408
Really?
They didn't call me!

01:39.513 --> 01:41.147
Who am I playing?

01:43.085 --> 01:44.521
Andy?

01:47.551 --> 01:51.594
Sync by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

02:20.816 --> 02:23.184
Two comps for m'lady
and her Gabe.

02:23.251 --> 02:24.818
It's closing night.

02:24.885 --> 02:26.052
Tomorrow we have to give
the theater over

02:26.120 --> 02:27.453
To the Scranton's
miss fitness pageant.

02:27.521 --> 02:30.022
I am so excited,
but I just need one.

02:30.090 --> 02:31.290
Gabe can't come.
Sorry.

02:31.358 --> 02:33.025
- What?
- Yeah.

02:33.093 --> 02:35.594
That's awful.
Everyone's gonna miss that guy.

02:35.662 --> 02:38.397
Gabe is not coming,
which is huge,

02:38.465 --> 02:40.898
Because my plan is to make Erin

02:40.965 --> 02:43.399
Fall back in love
with me tonight.

02:43.467 --> 02:47.235
Women cannot resist
a man singing show tunes.

02:47.303 --> 02:49.337
It's so powerful,
even a lot of men

02:49.405 --> 02:52.239
Can't resist a man
singing show tunes.

02:52.307 --> 02:54.108
- Oh, who else is going?
- Everyone.

02:54.175 --> 02:56.110
Gabe seemed to think
no one was going.

02:56.178 --> 02:58.413
What kind of terrible
rumor monger is Gabe?

02:58.480 --> 03:01.016
He is woefully ill informed,
all right?

03:01.083 --> 03:02.517
Excuse me,

03:02.585 --> 03:05.353
Clink, clink, clink, clink,
everybody.

03:05.421 --> 03:06.922
You're all coming
to my show tonight, right?

03:06.989 --> 03:08.290
Andy, what time's it start?

03:08.357 --> 03:09.857
- 8:00 P.M. Sharp.
- How long is it?

03:09.925 --> 03:12.859
- Hour, 45.
- No, I can't make it.

03:12.927 --> 03:15.525
They say that no one
can take your pride,

03:15.592 --> 03:18.093
But the people who cast
Andy's play,

03:18.161 --> 03:19.461
They took mine.

03:19.529 --> 03:21.664
Jim, Pam,
you guys are in, right?

03:21.731 --> 03:22.798
Oh, we wanted to,

03:22.866 --> 03:24.233
But our sitter
just fell through.

03:24.300 --> 03:25.634
I'm really sorry.

03:25.701 --> 03:26.701
Dwight?

03:26.769 --> 03:28.770
Uh, no, thank you.

03:28.838 --> 03:30.638
Last time I went
to the theater,

03:30.706 --> 03:34.775
A man dressed as a cat
sat on my lap.

03:34.843 --> 03:37.811
It would mean so much to me

03:37.878 --> 03:39.212
If you came to my show tonight.

03:39.280 --> 03:41.981
I can't, Andy.
It's too hard.

03:42.049 --> 03:44.416
That's...

03:44.484 --> 03:45.884
I put everything I had
into that audition.

03:45.952 --> 03:47.018
Do you understand that?

03:47.086 --> 03:48.353
If it makes
you feel any better,

03:48.421 --> 03:50.588
No one who auditioned
for the part of sweeney Todd

03:50.656 --> 03:51.622
Got that part.

03:51.690 --> 03:52.957
They had to bring in a ringer.

03:54.159 --> 03:55.693
This guy's, like, world class.

03:55.760 --> 03:57.328
You should not feel bad.

03:59.098 --> 04:01.466
I'm asking you
thespian to thespian.

04:01.534 --> 04:04.202
Will you please
be the bigger man

04:04.270 --> 04:05.303
And come to my show?

04:05.371 --> 04:06.838
I wish I could, Andy,

04:06.906 --> 04:08.106
But I can't.

04:08.174 --> 04:10.942
I have plans that night.

04:11.010 --> 04:16.680
<i>I'm going to see a friend
in a play called sweeney Todd.</i>

04:16.748 --> 04:17.914
You're that friend.

04:17.982 --> 04:19.249
I'm going to see your play.

04:21.385 --> 04:22.753
Noishe!

04:22.820 --> 04:24.721
And scene.

04:24.789 --> 04:27.890
Listen, I would like you to
take me to Andy's play tonight.

04:27.958 --> 04:29.691
Please, waste of time.

04:29.759 --> 04:32.160
You know what? Let's just knock
this out right now.

04:32.228 --> 04:33.528
Disrobe.

04:33.596 --> 04:35.995
Angela?
Don't like her anymore.

04:36.063 --> 04:37.658
Not attracted to her anymore.

04:37.726 --> 04:40.992
Just contractually obligated
to make a baby with her.

04:41.059 --> 04:42.526
Give me the punch card.

04:42.594 --> 04:44.461
No. If you want to punch
the punch card,

04:44.529 --> 04:45.595
You have to
take me to the show.

04:45.663 --> 04:47.397
That is not in the contract.

04:47.465 --> 04:49.499
Well, there's a lot
of gray area in that clause.

04:49.567 --> 04:51.401
Do you want to re-mediate?

04:51.469 --> 04:52.735
All right, fine!

04:52.803 --> 04:54.370
I'll go to your little show,

04:54.438 --> 04:56.939
But I'm not wearing a cape.
Thank you.

04:57.007 --> 04:59.408
Dwight and I have
a contractual agreement

04:59.475 --> 05:01.943
To procreate five times,
plain and simple.

05:02.011 --> 05:06.046
And should he develop
feelings for me?

05:06.114 --> 05:07.581
Well, that would be permissible

05:07.648 --> 05:13.185
Under item 7c, clause 2,
so I would not object.

05:13.253 --> 05:15.420
Hey.
How are those salads?

05:15.488 --> 05:16.821
It's my own fault...

05:16.889 --> 05:19.656
My parents used to scramble
to find babysitters

05:19.724 --> 05:22.125
So they could take
my little brother to do stuff.

05:22.193 --> 05:23.393
I understand
how hard it can be.

05:23.460 --> 05:26.094
I just... tonight,
I mean, if you could...

05:26.162 --> 05:27.228
We'll keep looking.

05:27.296 --> 05:28.429
- Yes!
- Really?

05:28.497 --> 05:29.731
I mean, who knows?

05:29.799 --> 05:31.433
Maybe I have a niece
my family never told me about.

05:31.501 --> 05:32.968
Oh, my gosh,
that would be amazing.

05:33.036 --> 05:34.536
- Yeah.
- For a lot of reasons.

05:34.604 --> 05:35.670
Yeah, I know.

05:35.738 --> 05:37.305
Neiche!

05:39.040 --> 05:40.107
Oh, hey, guys.

05:40.175 --> 05:41.808
You brought balloons to a play?

05:41.875 --> 05:44.242
I did, because
I am being the bigger man,

05:44.310 --> 05:46.046
And balloons are bigger
than flowers.

05:46.113 --> 05:47.580
<i>It's nice, like up.</i>

05:47.648 --> 05:49.015
Yes.

05:49.082 --> 05:50.515
Excuse me.

05:50.583 --> 05:52.450
<i>Are you the guy that did
an entire law & order episode</i>

05:52.518 --> 05:53.684
For his audition?

05:56.054 --> 05:58.421
Nope.

05:58.489 --> 06:00.223
- Guys?
- Hey!

06:00.291 --> 06:01.658
- Andy!
- Hey!

06:01.725 --> 06:03.926
You all made it.
Thank you so much.

06:03.994 --> 06:05.328
You should actually thank Erin.

06:05.395 --> 06:07.062
She's the one who agreed
to babysit.

06:07.130 --> 06:09.698
She's babysitting?

06:09.766 --> 06:11.900
I really wanted to see
Andy's play,

06:11.968 --> 06:14.035
Because he's so, so talented,

06:14.103 --> 06:17.504
But I've been trying to get
in the babysitting game forever.

06:17.572 --> 06:19.005
The 13-year-olds
in this town

06:19.073 --> 06:20.540
Have a complete monopoly.

06:20.608 --> 06:23.510
It's almost like
a babysitters' club.

06:23.577 --> 06:24.878
I understand.

06:24.945 --> 06:27.179
This is like...

06:27.247 --> 06:29.381
Huge opportunity for her.

06:36.423 --> 06:38.424
This is ridiculous.

06:38.492 --> 06:39.725
You'd think they'd
discourage people

06:39.793 --> 06:41.160
From bringing in balloons.

06:41.228 --> 06:44.597
Hey, I think this guy playing
sweeney Todd is my plumber.

06:44.665 --> 06:46.365
No, Darryl.

06:46.433 --> 06:48.668
This guy's
a world-class actor.

06:48.736 --> 06:50.503
He doesn't daylight
as your plumber.

06:50.571 --> 06:51.771
No, it's my plumber.

06:51.839 --> 06:53.139
Says so in his bio.

06:53.207 --> 06:55.308
Apparently, the director
discovered him doing karaoke.

06:55.375 --> 06:57.241
It's his first play.
He didn't even audition.

06:57.309 --> 06:58.574
Are you kidding me?

06:59.709 --> 07:01.076
If we don't listen
to the overture,

07:01.144 --> 07:02.410
We won't recognize
the musical themes

07:02.478 --> 07:03.411
When they come back later.

07:03.479 --> 07:05.013

Hello.

09:04.379 --> 09:05.378
I promise you

09:05.446 --> 09:07.213
That if you keep auditioning

09:07.281 --> 09:08.948
With a similar gusto...
Okay.

09:09.016 --> 09:10.583
We are going to find
a production

09:10.650 --> 09:13.018
With a role for Michael Scott.

09:13.086 --> 09:14.086
- Okay.
- Yes?

09:14.154 --> 09:15.320
- Yes.
- Good.

09:15.388 --> 09:16.622
- Good.
- Enjoy the second act.

09:16.689 --> 09:18.090
- You enjoy the second act.
- Have a refreshment.

09:18.157 --> 09:19.124
Thank you.
You, too.

09:19.192 --> 09:23.494
Oh, thank you, thank you.

09:23.562 --> 09:25.762
Come on, Dwight.

09:25.830 --> 09:27.797
Why are you dressed
like a seed catalog model?

09:27.865 --> 09:30.834
These are just my dirty
old gardening clothes.

09:30.901 --> 09:33.434
They were all that I had
in my car.

09:33.502 --> 09:34.701
Let's go.

09:38.672 --> 09:40.040
Hey, Erin, it's Pam.

09:40.107 --> 09:41.642
Hey, how you doin...

09:41.709 --> 09:43.009
No, no, don't put cece
on the phone,

09:43.077 --> 09:45.244
Because she can't talk yet.

09:45.312 --> 09:48.580
Okay. No, I was just calling
to see how everything's going.

09:48.648 --> 09:50.448
Yeah?
Yeah? It's good?

09:50.516 --> 09:52.383
The play?

09:52.451 --> 09:53.918
The play is kind of great.

09:53.986 --> 09:55.686
I mean, it's fun
to hear Andy sing

09:55.754 --> 09:57.822
In the appropriate setting.

09:57.889 --> 10:01.425
No, he's really sorry
you couldn't make it, too.

10:01.493 --> 10:02.493
Yeah.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.028
So thank you so much again.

10:04.095 --> 10:05.429
We're having a great time.

10:05.497 --> 10:06.864
Oh, they're
flashing the lights,

10:06.931 --> 10:07.931
So we should go in.

10:07.999 --> 10:09.566
Thanks. Bye.

10:11.102 --> 10:12.603
Okay, so we called,
and everything's fine.

10:12.670 --> 10:14.037
- Everything's fine.
- We can relax.

10:14.105 --> 10:15.939
We can relax.

11:18.392 --> 11:20.259
- Unfortunately,
in this ham-fisted production

11:20.327 --> 11:21.560
<i>Of sweeney Todd,</i>

11:21.627 --> 11:23.861
The real terror comes
from the vocal performances.

11:23.929 --> 11:24.995
New paragraph.

11:25.063 --> 11:28.799
Mr. Todd! Mr. Todd!
I found her!

11:28.867 --> 11:31.001
You found johanna.

11:31.069 --> 11:32.336
That monster of a judge

11:32.403 --> 11:34.604
Has locked her...

11:37.941 --> 11:40.709
Locked her away...

11:42.978 --> 11:46.613
There's a little bird
uttering around.

11:46.681 --> 11:48.949
Do hope it ceases chirping.

11:51.118 --> 11:52.618
How is that funny?

11:52.686 --> 11:54.286
The bird continues to call.

11:54.354 --> 11:56.521
Someone please
turn off your...Bird.

11:58.558 --> 12:00.325
Oh, for the love...
turn your phone off!

12:00.393 --> 12:01.993
There are signs!

12:02.061 --> 12:06.265
Oh, it appears the bird
was in mine own pocket

12:06.333 --> 12:07.635
This whole time.

12:07.703 --> 12:10.405
He's gone to sleep now.
I closed his beak.

12:10.473 --> 12:12.941
Mmm...[laughing alone]

12:13.009 --> 12:15.577
What is the news
of my darling daughter johanna?

12:16.813 --> 12:19.047
You know what?
Let me just double check,

12:19.115 --> 12:23.118
Make sure that bird...

12:23.185 --> 12:24.719
Okay, good.

12:24.787 --> 12:26.187
It's off.

12:26.255 --> 12:27.555
I mean, silenced.

12:27.622 --> 12:30.391
I silenced it by killing it.

12:30.459 --> 12:32.226
I've killed it!
I'm a murderer!

12:32.294 --> 12:33.995
Just like you, sweeney Todd!

12:34.062 --> 12:35.596
See? It all connects.

12:36.832 --> 12:39.166
Not that I know
you're a murderer.

12:39.234 --> 12:40.968
My character
doesn't know that yet.

12:42.804 --> 12:44.337
But I'm suspicious,

12:44.405 --> 12:45.572
Because of all the razors

12:45.640 --> 12:47.574
That you have laying around.

12:47.642 --> 12:50.610
And you spend time alone,

12:50.678 --> 12:53.279
But you're a barber,
so that'legit.

12:53.346 --> 12:55.114
So there's that.

12:55.182 --> 12:56.281
But...

12:56.349 --> 12:57.749
Where is johanna?

12:57.817 --> 12:58.850
- A madhouse.
- A madhouse?

12:58.918 --> 13:01.920
- Yes, a madhouse.
- A madhouse?

13:01.987 --> 13:03.688
Johanna is as good as rescued.

13:03.756 --> 13:04.989
Where do you suppose

13:05.057 --> 13:06.624
All the wig makers of london

13:06.691 --> 13:08.793
Go to obtain their human hair?

13:08.860 --> 13:11.361
Do you think...

13:11.429 --> 13:14.264
So you think...

13:23.438 --> 13:25.306
So you think...
fogg's asylum, why not?

13:31.314 --> 13:32.548
Sounds like cece.

13:32.616 --> 13:34.917
Okay, I think everybody
just needs to relax.

13:34.984 --> 13:36.786
Oh, my God, go, go.

13:36.853 --> 13:37.953
Oh, my God.

13:44.159 --> 13:46.359
That's really
irresponsible of Erin.

13:46.460 --> 13:48.424
S a ible bysitter.

13:53.338 --> 13:54.706
I just didn't think
you guys were gonna see us.

13:54.773 --> 13:56.174
We were just gonna stop by
and then get some ice cream

13:56.241 --> 13:57.641
And then go home.

13:57.709 --> 13:59.543
Okay, this was pretty simple.

13:59.611 --> 14:01.079
Why are you here?

14:01.147 --> 14:02.480
All you had to do
was play with her

14:02.548 --> 14:03.748
For, like, 30 minutes
and then put her to bed.

14:03.816 --> 14:04.883
Then we were kind of hoping

14:04.951 --> 14:06.151
That you wouldn't
touch her again.

14:06.219 --> 14:08.454
Babies shouldn't have
ice cream, by the way.

14:08.521 --> 14:09.588
I'm sorry.

14:09.656 --> 14:11.223
I just... I really wanted
to see Andy.

14:11.291 --> 14:12.858
You guys made it sound
so unmissable,

14:12.926 --> 14:15.027
And you set me up
with a car seat and everything.

14:15.094 --> 14:17.662
Well, the car seat was to
take her to the hospital or...

14:17.730 --> 14:20.031
But why would I take her
to the hospital?

14:20.096 --> 14:21.695
You know what,
it doesn't matter.

14:21.763 --> 14:22.829
It doesn't matter.

14:22.896 --> 14:24.162
Why don't I just take her home,

14:24.230 --> 14:25.897
And let you guys finish,

14:25.965 --> 14:27.799
And then you should stay out
as late as you want.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.501
No, we're good.
Thank you, though.

14:29.568 --> 14:30.835
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

14:30.903 --> 14:32.337
Okay. All right,
bye, cece.

14:34.207 --> 14:35.776
- Okay.
- All right.

14:35.844 --> 14:37.211
Well, we're never leaving
the house again.

14:37.278 --> 14:38.378
Not together.

15:05.898 --> 15:07.932
<i>That was more horrifying
than nunsense.</i>

15:07.999 --> 15:09.368
All that singing got in the way

15:09.436 --> 15:11.770
Of some perfectly good murders.

15:11.838 --> 15:14.573
Where's my car?

15:23.785 --> 15:24.918
Come on.

15:27.455 --> 15:29.789
Mmm! Fruit is so much better
when it's dried.

15:29.856 --> 15:31.256
I've already eaten,
like, 30 apricots.

15:31.324 --> 15:33.592
- Darryl?
- Hey!

15:33.659 --> 15:35.226
Didn't know
you were gonna be here.

15:35.293 --> 15:36.960
How's the toilet?
Silent.

15:37.028 --> 15:38.761
Look, congratulations.
Thank you.

15:38.828 --> 15:39.994
I had no idea.

15:40.061 --> 15:42.625
This plumber has pipes.

15:42.693 --> 15:44.560
Yeah, good job.
Well done.

15:44.628 --> 15:46.295
You're the guy who booed me.

15:48.765 --> 15:50.265
No, there were
a lot of people booing you.

15:50.333 --> 15:51.333
I wasn't one of them.

15:51.401 --> 15:52.702
No, I saw you,

15:52.769 --> 15:54.070
And you were the only one.

15:54.139 --> 15:56.006
Get your eyes checked,
chucklehead.

15:56.074 --> 15:57.407
Be cool, Michael.

15:57.475 --> 15:59.042
I saw this guy kill
a bunch of people.

15:59.143 --> 16:00.744
Good work.
Thank you.

16:04.886 --> 16:05.986
You didn't have to boo him.

16:06.054 --> 16:07.822
Well, he was getting
a lot of applause,

16:07.890 --> 16:09.492
And I just didn't think
it was indicative

16:09.560 --> 16:11.028
Of how people
were really feeling.

16:11.095 --> 16:12.262
How would you like it
if we booed you?

16:12.330 --> 16:13.496
That would never happen.

16:14.631 --> 16:16.230
- Okay.
- Boo!

16:16.298 --> 16:17.264
I appreciate the feedback.

16:19.934 --> 16:23.836
I don't like that at all.

16:23.904 --> 16:25.671
Are you ready?

16:25.738 --> 16:26.705
Yes.

16:26.773 --> 16:27.773
Oh, I'm so scared!

16:27.840 --> 16:29.543
Okay, kill me!
Just kill me! Kill me!

16:31.415 --> 16:33.449
Ah, blood everywhere.

16:35.952 --> 16:37.853
I'm so glad we're hanging
out again outside of work.

16:37.921 --> 16:40.555
Yeah, me, too.

16:40.623 --> 16:42.224
Okay, I kill you now.

16:42.292 --> 16:44.362
- Okay.
- All right.

16:44.429 --> 16:47.199
All right, let's do this.

16:47.267 --> 16:48.366
No, actually, Dwight,

16:48.434 --> 16:50.001
I didn't realize how far
this walk was,

16:50.069 --> 16:51.335
And I...
I'm exhausted.

16:51.403 --> 16:52.536
It's okay, I smell.

16:52.604 --> 16:53.637
No. No, no, no.

16:53.705 --> 16:54.838
I think I just want to go home,

16:54.906 --> 16:56.371
But it's okay.

16:56.439 --> 16:57.638
This can count
as one of your times.

16:57.706 --> 16:58.906
No, no, no.

16:58.974 --> 17:00.374
Contractually, we're obligated
to have sex.

17:00.441 --> 17:01.674
Well, I won't tell
if you don't.

17:01.742 --> 17:03.543
I will tell.
I will tell the mediator.

17:06.646 --> 17:07.878
What... what are you...

17:07.946 --> 17:08.980
Oh, okay.

17:09.048 --> 17:11.516
Oh, was that in the way?
Get rid of it.

17:13.386 --> 17:16.186
Good night, Dwight.

17:21.657 --> 17:23.290
Good night.

17:25.159 --> 17:27.726
These would have been
your seats.

17:27.794 --> 17:29.194
Best seats in the house.

17:29.262 --> 17:30.896
Lot of people think
it would be the front row,

17:30.964 --> 17:32.230
But, actually, right here,

17:32.298 --> 17:34.865
This is where
the speakers converge

17:34.933 --> 17:38.167
And the sound just, like,
nails you right here.

17:38.235 --> 17:39.168
This is awesome.

17:41.305 --> 17:42.305
Sorry.
Oh.

17:42.372 --> 17:43.706
Hi, Gabe.

17:43.773 --> 17:46.576
Yeah, I just stopped
by Andy's cast party

17:46.644 --> 17:48.578
To say hi to everyone.

17:48.645 --> 17:50.079
Oh, sure, I can
pick you up some soup.

17:50.147 --> 17:51.981
What do you want?

17:52.049 --> 17:54.249
That's broth, Gabe.

17:54.317 --> 17:56.951
Okay, I...
I'll see you soup. [giggles]

17:57.019 --> 17:58.819
Okay, I have to go.

17:58.887 --> 17:59.986
Thank you so much.

18:00.054 --> 18:01.219
This is so much fun,

18:01.287 --> 18:03.119
And I'm really sorry
that I missed your play,

18:03.187 --> 18:04.787
But next time, I'll be there.

18:04.855 --> 18:07.022
Or here.
Right here, I promise.

18:07.089 --> 18:08.055
Awesome.

18:08.123 --> 18:09.756
- Okay.
- See you later.

18:09.824 --> 18:11.724
Thank you.

18:20.303 --> 18:21.304
<i>It's like the hurt locker.</i>

18:21.371 --> 18:23.807
This night was a disaster.

18:23.874 --> 18:25.441
No, it was not a disaster.

18:25.509 --> 18:29.411
It was weird,
but it wasn't a disaster.

18:29.479 --> 18:32.481
I think we have, like,
a gift bottle of irish cream.

18:32.549 --> 18:33.548
Yeah?

18:33.616 --> 18:34.516
We could put that
in orange juice.

18:34.584 --> 18:35.917
- Get it.
- Yeah?

18:35.985 --> 18:37.485
- Let's get our juice on.
- Yeah.

18:37.553 --> 18:40.788
<i>[to rhythm of who let the dogs
out] ruh ruh ruh ruh-ruh.</i>

18:40.856 --> 18:42.957
Found him.

18:43.025 --> 18:45.293
Hey, what's going on here?

18:45.360 --> 18:46.293
Post-show blues?

18:46.361 --> 18:47.794
Yeah, I guess
you could say that.

18:47.862 --> 18:49.796
Yeah, I get those
every day after work.

18:49.864 --> 18:51.398
Your show
was really great, Andy.

18:51.466 --> 18:53.266
Interesting subject matter.

18:53.334 --> 18:54.600
I'm surprised
you pulled it off.

18:54.668 --> 18:56.802
It was like amateur hour.

18:56.870 --> 18:58.971
It was an amateur production,
technically.

18:59.039 --> 19:00.839
Oscar, enough
with the sass, please!

19:00.907 --> 19:02.975
God! What is wrong with you?

19:03.042 --> 19:04.443
Andy, listen to me.

19:04.511 --> 19:05.944
Look me in the eye.

19:06.012 --> 19:07.911
I thought
that you were awesome.

19:07.979 --> 19:09.011
Stop just saying that.

19:09.078 --> 19:10.545
I am not just saying that.

19:10.613 --> 19:12.146
You can trust that I am
telling you the truth.

19:12.214 --> 19:14.048
I booed someone tonight.

19:14.115 --> 19:15.582
I have no filter.

19:15.650 --> 19:17.951
And if I thought you were
terrible, I would have booed.

19:18.018 --> 19:19.752
And if I thought
you had done a better job,

19:19.819 --> 19:22.420
I would be saying
nicer things right now.

19:22.488 --> 19:25.589
But I thought that you were
exactly awesome.

19:25.657 --> 19:28.925
No better, no worse.

19:28.993 --> 19:30.927
Thank you.
That feels good.

19:30.995 --> 19:32.862
I did not say that
to make you feel good.

19:32.930 --> 19:35.031
I just said it.

19:35.099 --> 19:36.833
Total integrity.

19:36.901 --> 19:38.636
Andy, sing us another song.

19:38.704 --> 19:40.173
Thanks, but I feel
like a loner right now.

19:40.241 --> 19:41.775
Oh, come on, Andy.
You were the highlight.

19:41.843 --> 19:43.010
Come on, Andy, seriously.

19:43.078 --> 19:46.479
Andy! Andy! Andy!

19:46.547 --> 19:47.647
Andy! Andy!
