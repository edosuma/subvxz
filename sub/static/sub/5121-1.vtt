WEBVTT

00:57.241 --> 00:59.471
I was talking
to Noah last night.

00:59.544 --> 01:01.535
You know, Noah,
my brother-in-law.

01:01.612 --> 01:05.069
Yeah, and he was telling me
about this storm they were having,

01:05.149 --> 01:09.449
and he said to me,
"Bette, Bette dear,

01:09.520 --> 01:13.251
this is retribution
from on high."

01:13.324 --> 01:15.952
Yeah, I know, I know.

01:16.027 --> 01:17.289
What's that, dear?

01:18.329 --> 01:20.729
Oh, yes, I heard.

01:20.798 --> 01:22.766
Poor old Felix.

01:22.834 --> 01:24.631
How are the boys taking it?

01:24.702 --> 01:27.500
No, well, you never know, do you?

01:27.572 --> 01:30.200
Yeah, you've gotta enjoy life.

01:31.142 --> 01:34.373
You know,
when my little Ruthie died,

01:34.445 --> 01:37.141
I started looking in the mirror
every morning...

01:37.215 --> 01:39.513
<i>You are bringing
the writer up here.</i>

01:39.584 --> 01:43.577
...and I'd say,
"Bette, Bette, honey, this is it, girl.

01:43.654 --> 01:45.144
"The show's on the road,

01:45.223 --> 01:48.420
and you've to get get up
and get at 'em."

01:48.492 --> 01:50.983
Yeah...

01:51.062 --> 01:53.656
Oh, it'll be lovely to see you again...

01:53.731 --> 01:56.461
Well, do you think you'll ever
get out this way?

01:59.770 --> 02:03.536
Oh, I'm going to Las Vegas.

02:04.609 --> 02:07.942
Tomorrow. Going up to see
my sister-in-law...

02:08.012 --> 02:10.708
my sister-in-law, Sandra, yeah.

02:10.781 --> 02:15.582
And Gina, my niece...
well, I call her my niece...

02:15.653 --> 02:18.417
is driving me up there
in the morning.

02:18.489 --> 02:20.480
We're going to take Sandra
to a show.

02:20.558 --> 02:22.651
Sandra's lived there all her life,

02:22.727 --> 02:24.456
and she's never been to a show!

02:24.528 --> 02:26.359
Isn't that something, huh?

02:27.632 --> 02:30.396
Listen, I'll talk to you soon,
sweetie pie.

02:30.468 --> 02:32.129
Bye.

02:40.077 --> 02:41.066
Did you see that?

02:42.713 --> 02:43.839
Felix?

02:44.882 --> 02:46.213
Can we go now?

02:52.690 --> 02:54.885
- What happened?
- It's over.

02:54.959 --> 02:58.224
- It's over?
- Do a rewrite!

02:58.296 --> 03:00.696
- Yeah?
- Let's get out of here.

03:01.966 --> 03:03.729
Come on, Felix.

03:04.936 --> 03:06.028
Come on.

03:15.947 --> 03:18.677
One decaf, no sugar,
extra-foam latte.

03:18.749 --> 03:19.807
- One iced tea.
- Thank you.

03:19.884 --> 03:21.181
- Thanks, Lily.
- You're welcome.

03:21.252 --> 03:22.514
How did the reading go?

03:22.586 --> 03:25.248
My agent thinks I have a really
good chance, so who knows?

03:25.323 --> 03:26.620
- You'll do fine.
- Thanks.

03:26.691 --> 03:28.420
From your mouth to God's ear.

03:28.492 --> 03:30.892
<i>- Cut!
- This is my friend Felix.</i>

03:30.962 --> 03:33.362
Hi, Felix. Like the cat.

03:33.431 --> 03:35.365
- That's funny.
- Felix the Cat.

03:37.134 --> 03:38.465
Nine lives.

03:40.504 --> 03:41.630
That's Lily. She's sweet.

03:41.706 --> 03:43.503
She's from Russia
and wants to be in movies.

03:43.574 --> 03:45.064
She's my new best friend.

03:45.142 --> 03:47.474
Hello?

03:47.545 --> 03:49.570
Hello? Hello?

03:51.248 --> 03:52.545
Anyway, where was I?

03:53.985 --> 03:56.215
Right, this woman Shelley.

03:56.287 --> 03:59.723
She says you go back
through past lives, incarnations,

03:59.790 --> 04:02.884
and you get in touch with everything
that makes you do stuff in this life.

04:02.960 --> 04:05.360
Say you were an addict or nuts
or, like, stuck in old habits.

04:05.429 --> 04:07.522
You have fears of elevators
and spiders and snakes

04:07.598 --> 04:10.123
or stuff like clowns and opera singers,
anything freaky...

04:10.201 --> 04:12.294
it all comes up through
past-life regression

04:12.370 --> 04:14.497
so you get pulled back
through the slipstream.

04:14.572 --> 04:16.802
It's karma... Indian stuff
from millions of years ago.

04:16.874 --> 04:18.704
The Akashic records
or something like that.

04:18.776 --> 04:20.266
This woman,
she is totally awesome.

04:20.344 --> 04:22.107
It's awesome.
Totally awesome.

04:22.179 --> 04:24.773
...past-life regression,
pulled through the slipstream.

04:24.849 --> 04:27.784
...walk you through this stuff,
get you to clean your side of the street.

04:27.852 --> 04:30.343
My yoga teacher told me about her.
You ought to try yoga.

04:31.555 --> 04:33.785
You ought to try yoga,
and wheatgrass and colonics.

04:33.858 --> 04:36.952
She charges $300 an hour.
She's got this place in Culver City.

04:37.028 --> 04:40.122
Her name's Shelley something.
It's one of those names you can't say.

04:40.197 --> 04:43.792
- Anyway, her first name's Shelley...
- Hello?

04:43.868 --> 04:46.234
A poodle called Tiddles,
but you go into her place,

04:46.303 --> 04:49.204
and she does this channeling,
these aura readings.

04:49.273 --> 04:51.707
- Oh, she says that all this...
- Where was I?

04:51.776 --> 04:53.004
...an illusion, a dream.

04:56.280 --> 04:58.874
Felix? That's all it is.

04:58.949 --> 05:00.507
"A dream within a dream."

05:00.584 --> 05:02.108
What?

05:02.186 --> 05:05.121
"A dream within a dream."
Edgar Allan Poe.

05:05.189 --> 05:07.749
Sorry, I overheard you talking.

05:09.660 --> 05:13.027
A dream within a dream.

05:20.571 --> 05:22.698
That's so cool.

05:22.773 --> 05:27.710
Anyway, she's got this really stinky dog,
but cute, called Tiddles.

05:35.086 --> 05:36.280
Felix!

06:05.382 --> 06:07.111
- What's your problem, man?
- No problem.

06:07.184 --> 06:08.708
- What's your problem!
- No problem.

06:08.786 --> 06:10.083
Get out of there.

06:10.754 --> 06:12.915
What's your problem?
What's wrong with you!

06:12.990 --> 06:14.958
Oh, my God.

06:17.194 --> 06:21.654
We've lost the plot!
We've lost the plot!

06:21.732 --> 06:24.530
We've lost the plot.

06:24.602 --> 06:27.366
Hey, you! Get out of my car.

06:28.005 --> 06:30.098
Call 911, please! Somebody help!

06:30.174 --> 06:31.835
Do something, please!

06:31.909 --> 06:33.433
Help, help.

06:41.552 --> 06:43.144
No! We've lost the plot!

06:43.220 --> 06:47.782
Watch out. My name's Gavin.
You mind? This is great!

06:47.858 --> 06:50.793
Hey, this is digital, man.
Film is out. It's obsolete.

06:50.861 --> 06:52.726
This is digital, man.

06:52.796 --> 06:54.127
Welcome to America.

06:55.132 --> 06:56.793
Oh, my God, this is insane.

06:56.867 --> 06:57.856
Awesome.

07:11.782 --> 07:13.113
Can you tell us what happened?

07:13.184 --> 07:15.584
This is guy was getting out
of his car and going crazy.

07:15.653 --> 07:18.315
...have any reason why,
he started shooting.

07:18.389 --> 07:20.949
- He really...
- I was trying to call 911,

07:21.025 --> 07:22.617
and no one was helping me.

07:22.693 --> 07:24.456
Then these guys
came out of nowhere...

07:24.528 --> 07:26.393
He got off a few shots.

07:26.463 --> 07:29.193
<i>Shooting mostly Democrats.</i>

07:29.266 --> 07:31.325
I mean, I didn't know what to do.

07:31.402 --> 07:33.962
It was complete pandemonium
on this freeway, man,

07:34.038 --> 07:37.940
and there was a man
sitting in a car, staring at...

07:38.008 --> 07:39.635
Of course, I was terrified. I mean...

07:41.178 --> 07:42.668
Can you describe what happened?

07:42.746 --> 07:46.409
I saw the guy in this vehicle, the beat-up
one with Pennsylvania plates,

07:46.483 --> 07:48.144
just get out and lose
his fucking mind.

07:48.219 --> 07:51.052
- La-la land.
- I was terrified.

07:53.791 --> 07:55.349
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

08:08.439 --> 08:09.599
We're here.

08:10.808 --> 08:12.173
We are?

08:12.243 --> 08:13.267
Yeah.

08:16.380 --> 08:18.507
What do they put in that stuff,
what is it, "blatte"?

08:18.582 --> 08:19.708
What do you mean?

08:19.783 --> 08:22.377
You've been out of it
for three hours, dead to the world.

08:22.453 --> 08:25.422
I didn't sleep much last night.

08:26.624 --> 08:28.023
<i>- Felix?
- Wh...</i>

08:28.092 --> 08:29.889
Look at that sky.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.864
<i>Felix!</i>

08:34.932 --> 08:36.797
You want to come in?

08:36.866 --> 08:38.835
No, I've gotta get back.

08:38.902 --> 08:40.426
I've gotta get back.

08:44.508 --> 08:45.600
Okay.

08:51.982 --> 08:54.849
See you tomorrow.
Same time.

08:54.918 --> 08:56.146
Same time.

08:57.254 --> 08:59.279
- See you.
- Drive safe.

08:59.356 --> 09:00.448
I will.

09:23.547 --> 09:24.536
Hello?

09:25.749 --> 09:29.583
What?
Channels four and seven.

09:29.653 --> 09:32.281
Come on, you're not serious!

09:35.225 --> 09:38.194
Oh, my God, I am on TV!

09:38.262 --> 09:40.822
<i>... and he shoots
this woman in a car,</i>

09:40.898 --> 09:43.458
<i>and he's yelling something,
I don't even know what.</i>

09:44.802 --> 09:46.292
<i>Police commended the men...</i>

09:46.370 --> 09:48.395
Oh, my God, I look horrible!

09:48.472 --> 09:51.339
God! Not that bad.

09:52.343 --> 09:53.810
Stormy!

09:58.382 --> 10:00.543
Mommy's gonna be a movie star!

10:01.985 --> 10:03.282
Look! Look, look.

10:03.354 --> 10:07.313
Oh, listen, where are you?
Are you in the bar?

10:08.325 --> 10:10.657
<i>- Are you in there now?
- Gina!</i>

10:10.728 --> 10:12.093
Why didn't he wake me?

10:12.162 --> 10:14.096
I can't believe you slept through it.

10:14.164 --> 10:15.153
Who were you with?

10:15.232 --> 10:17.132
- Felix Bonoeffer.
- Who's he?

10:17.201 --> 10:19.795
The older gentleman
in the red convertible Impala.

10:19.870 --> 10:21.599
- Gina!
- Okay.

10:21.672 --> 10:24.835
Listen, I've gotta go. Mort's being
a real pain in the butt tonight.

10:24.908 --> 10:27.502
<i>... shot him at point-blank range.</i>

10:27.578 --> 10:30.172
<i>The gunman was heard
screaming at other drivers,</i>

10:30.247 --> 10:31.646
<i>"We've lost the plot!"</i>

10:31.715 --> 10:33.114
I'm not going to be here next week

10:33.183 --> 10:34.810
because I'm driving
my aunt up to Vegas.

10:34.885 --> 10:36.910
I'll call you as soon as I get back.

10:36.987 --> 10:39.319
Gina, would you come on
and get off the phone now?

10:39.390 --> 10:40.414
Look, I'm sorry...

10:40.491 --> 10:41.822
It's playing in there now?

10:41.892 --> 10:43.792
<i>... and that, folks,
is the way it happened.</i>

10:43.861 --> 10:44.919
<i>Well, I'm not a crook.</i>

10:44.995 --> 10:47.327
<i>Thanks so much for joining me
and have a great night.</i>

10:47.398 --> 10:48.990
- Women!
- Yeah!

10:51.769 --> 10:52.963
I need you here.

10:54.605 --> 10:56.470
Hey, Gav, how's Brian?

10:56.540 --> 10:57.564
How you feeling?

11:02.112 --> 11:04.410
<i>Right, this woman Shelley.</i>

11:26.437 --> 11:26.970
<i>Good night.</i>

11:26.970 --> 11:27.561
<i>Good night.</i>

11:36.647 --> 11:38.308
So, you taking off tomorrow?

11:38.382 --> 11:40.077
Yeah, early, about 8:00.

11:40.150 --> 11:42.846
All right. You know not
to get in no trouble.

11:42.920 --> 11:46.083
- Yeah, I know.
- Try to drive safely, okay?

11:46.156 --> 11:47.646
I'm a pretty safe driver.

11:47.724 --> 11:50.488
I should charge you extra
for the security work, you know?

11:50.561 --> 11:52.893
- Thank you. I appreciate it.
- Good night.

11:52.963 --> 11:54.225
Good night.

12:05.309 --> 12:07.209
- Are you Bette Lustig's niece?
- What?

12:07.277 --> 12:08.676
Are you Bette Lustig's niece?

12:08.745 --> 12:11.009
- Oh, my God!
- Are you Bette Lustig's niece?

12:11.081 --> 12:13.413
What's your problem?
Why you bothering the lady?

12:13.484 --> 12:14.576
I'm not bothering anyone...

12:14.651 --> 12:17.245
You opened up her car door.
I would say that was bothering her.

12:17.321 --> 12:19.255
- I want to talk to her.
- Wait a minute.

12:19.323 --> 12:20.585
He was in the bar earlier.

12:20.657 --> 12:22.625
Yeah, he was quiet, no trouble.

12:22.693 --> 12:24.388
So what's the deal then, brother?

12:24.461 --> 12:25.951
Is she Bette Lustig's niece?

12:26.029 --> 12:27.394
Leave him, Mort.

12:27.464 --> 12:31.195
It's okay. My name is Bonoeffer,
Felix Bonoeffer.

12:31.268 --> 12:33.429
- Bonoeffer?
- Yeah, Felix Bonoeffer.

12:33.504 --> 12:35.870
I saw you on the news
just now with my friend.

12:35.939 --> 12:38.134
- Tracy Abbott.
...and at the racetrack.

12:38.208 --> 12:40.039
- That's right, yes.
- What is all this?

12:40.110 --> 12:43.204
- I know you.
- Okay, look, I gotta go.

12:43.280 --> 12:45.271
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

12:45.349 --> 12:46.941
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

12:47.017 --> 12:49.713
- Easy does it, now, fella.
- I will. Okay.

12:59.863 --> 13:02.388
Hey, Gina,
are you sure you're okay?

13:02.466 --> 13:03.660
I'll be fine.

13:11.575 --> 13:14.476
<i>... crossfire shootout
on the Morning View Freeway.</i>

13:15.579 --> 13:17.877
Gina, you know how to reach me.

13:17.948 --> 13:19.415
I do!

13:40.771 --> 13:44.571
You're a real good citizen,
Mort, the best.

13:45.576 --> 13:47.043
Ray, can we talk?

13:47.110 --> 13:49.010
Nothing to talk about, baby.

13:50.380 --> 13:51.506
I need more time.

13:53.216 --> 13:55.241
Time's up, old pal,
know what I mean?

13:55.319 --> 13:56.343
It's zippo.

13:57.788 --> 13:59.278
So what do I do now?

13:59.356 --> 14:00.618
Just drive.

14:00.691 --> 14:01.680
Where?

14:01.758 --> 14:03.419
You know where. Drive.

15:18.068 --> 15:20.798
It's not meant to happen
for me like this, Ray.

15:20.871 --> 15:23.840
I got a wife, two kids.

15:23.907 --> 15:26.000
It was just business.
I can pay you back.

15:26.076 --> 15:29.443
Say bye-bye, little birdies,
fly, fly far away.

15:29.513 --> 15:31.208
Stop! Don't do this!

15:31.281 --> 15:32.771
Bye-bye.

16:41.752 --> 16:43.743
Did you get through to Sandra?

16:43.820 --> 16:45.082
No.

16:45.155 --> 16:48.386
No, I left her a message, told her
we'd be there around 4:00, 4:30,

16:48.458 --> 16:50.858
and that tomorrow
we'd take her to a magic show.

16:50.927 --> 16:52.053
What did she say?

16:53.063 --> 16:55.327
I told you she wasn't there.

16:58.468 --> 17:01.232
- It's so hot.
- You want some water?

17:01.304 --> 17:04.740
Your Uncle Bernie used to say
I was like a cat on a hot tin roof,

17:04.808 --> 17:08.675
like Elizabeth Taylor
in that picture with Richard Burton.

17:08.744 --> 17:10.473
- Paul Newman.
- Who?

17:10.547 --> 17:11.877
Paul Newman.

17:11.948 --> 17:14.916
You know, he had
the most beautiful blue eyes.

17:14.984 --> 17:17.579
- Who?
- Richard Burton.

17:18.655 --> 17:19.747
Ready?

17:19.823 --> 17:24.624
I'll have a glass of milk,
two poached eggs for my friend,

17:24.694 --> 17:26.888
and is it too late for oatmeal?

17:26.963 --> 17:28.396
No, you could get oatmeal.

17:28.464 --> 17:31.229
Great, I'll have it
with honey and a banana

17:31.301 --> 17:33.235
and a glass of orange juice, please.

17:33.303 --> 17:34.770
Alrighty.

17:36.373 --> 17:40.207
Hey, Joanie,
I'm gonna take five minutes, okay?

17:41.711 --> 17:45.340
All right, Mel, we got two poached,
oatmeal with a side of banana,

17:45.415 --> 17:46.609
and a milk and an OJ.

17:47.150 --> 17:49.641
Okay. Busy out there?

17:49.719 --> 17:52.449
Yeah, packed to the rafters.

17:54.624 --> 17:57.388
My feet are killing me.

17:57.460 --> 18:00.224
Hey, Bonnie, what time is it?

18:01.231 --> 18:02.459
My watch stopped.

18:05.535 --> 18:08.595
Call Joanie when my order's ready.

18:08.672 --> 18:10.537
I'm gonna get some air.

18:11.842 --> 18:14.538
She needs to move her ass, anyway.

18:17.714 --> 18:19.409
Hi, Bonnie.

18:19.482 --> 18:20.813
Hey, Eddie.

18:32.662 --> 18:34.596
How's your daughter doing, Eddie?

18:34.664 --> 18:36.097
She's fine, thank you.

18:41.238 --> 18:43.172
<i>How's your daughter doing, Eddie?</i>

18:43.240 --> 18:44.673
<i>She's fine, thank you.</i>

18:52.849 --> 18:54.111
Good morning.

19:06.696 --> 19:07.856
Take it easy, Bonnie.

19:07.931 --> 19:08.989
- Bonnie.
- Yeah?

19:10.200 --> 19:12.100
You still want Joanie
to take it out?

19:12.168 --> 19:13.658
Forget it. I'll take it.

19:15.772 --> 19:17.239
Hey, are you okay?

19:17.307 --> 19:18.706
Yeah, yeah, I'm all right.

19:18.775 --> 19:21.573
Hey, thanks a bunch, Joanie.

19:21.645 --> 19:23.374
Sorry, Bonnie, I forgot.

19:23.446 --> 19:29.146
All right, ladies, here we are...
poached eggs.

19:29.219 --> 19:31.847
There's your oatmeal
with bananas and honey.

19:31.922 --> 19:33.048
Thank you.

19:36.393 --> 19:38.224
Hello there, gentlemen.

19:38.295 --> 19:40.991
The house is open.
You can sit anywhere.

19:45.769 --> 19:48.135
There you go.
Anything to drink?

19:48.204 --> 19:49.728
Coffee.

19:50.907 --> 19:52.397
Okay, coffee.

19:52.475 --> 19:55.137
Sir, anything for you?

19:55.211 --> 19:57.907
Okay. One coffee coming up.

19:57.981 --> 20:00.006
Would you like some water?

20:00.083 --> 20:01.175
No.

20:02.752 --> 20:03.878
Bonnie.

20:05.855 --> 20:06.981
Yes, sir?

20:07.057 --> 20:08.922
That is your name, is it not?

20:08.992 --> 20:10.050
Excuse me?

20:10.126 --> 20:12.060
- Bonnie.
- Take it easy, Bonnie.

20:12.128 --> 20:13.755
That is your name, is it not?

20:13.830 --> 20:16.628
Oh, yeah, it is.

20:17.734 --> 20:19.361
What do you call the other one?

20:20.370 --> 20:22.429
Sorry, my friend can be
quite rude sometimes.

20:22.505 --> 20:25.440
- Isn't that right, Fat Man?
- Wish you wouldn't call me that.

20:25.508 --> 20:26.532
- Call you what?
- Fat Man.

20:26.609 --> 20:28.440
- But you are fat.
- I'm not fat.

20:28.511 --> 20:30.741
Bonnie, don't you think
my friend here is fat?

20:30.814 --> 20:33.044
Don't you think he's fat, Bonnie?

20:33.950 --> 20:35.508
No, sir.

20:35.585 --> 20:37.678
Thank you, lady, thank you.

20:37.754 --> 20:38.914
So, what'll it be?

20:41.591 --> 20:42.580
I would like...

20:44.361 --> 20:46.090
Let's see here, I would like...

20:46.663 --> 20:51.032
Omelet, Denver style.
Would you recommend Denver style?

20:59.876 --> 21:02.640
...side of bacon, real crisp,
like my mom used to make it.

21:02.712 --> 21:04.543
Oh, I see hash browns
are included.

21:04.614 --> 21:07.310
That's good,
and toast included also.

21:07.384 --> 21:10.012
Ray, toast is included also.

21:10.086 --> 21:12.384
Isn't that something?
So, let's see here.

21:14.124 --> 21:18.754
Not your sourdough
but your whole wheat,

21:18.828 --> 21:20.318
and real well-done.

21:20.397 --> 21:22.024
Like his mama used to make it.

21:22.098 --> 21:24.089
Yes, how my mommy
used to make it.

21:26.503 --> 21:27.993
For you, sir?

21:28.071 --> 21:30.403
We're making
little Bonnie nervous, Fat Man.

21:30.473 --> 21:31.906
Are we making you nervous?

21:31.975 --> 21:33.442
We're real sorry, Bonnie.

21:33.510 --> 21:35.978
Look, I don't want any trouble.

21:36.046 --> 21:37.343
Who's causing trouble?

21:37.414 --> 21:39.712
I know what it is.
She thinks you're Dr. Phil.

21:39.783 --> 21:41.080
It's making her all of a dither.

21:41.151 --> 21:42.778
You think I look
like Dr. Phil, Bonnie?

21:42.852 --> 21:44.752
- Probably turning her on.
- I don't know, sir.

21:44.821 --> 21:46.652
I mean,
is my resemblance to Dr. Phil

21:46.723 --> 21:50.523
making you hot, bothered,
bewildered, and juicy?

21:51.327 --> 21:54.558
'Cause if it is, Bonnie,
we can find a cozy little place,

21:54.631 --> 21:57.122
<i>and we can get really acquainted.</i>

22:03.506 --> 22:05.838
Look, please, do you...

22:07.477 --> 22:10.207
Do you want to order?

22:11.581 --> 22:12.843
I think not.

22:17.887 --> 22:19.684
I'm just happy being here,

22:19.756 --> 22:22.452
if that's all hunkety-dunkety-doo
with you, Bonnie.

22:27.197 --> 22:28.255
So...

22:29.265 --> 22:31.028
<i>what do you call the other one?</i>

22:37.207 --> 22:39.334
<i>Come out with your hands up.</i>

22:42.378 --> 22:44.812
Isn't it just a beautiful day
out there?

22:44.881 --> 22:47.111
<i>Come and get me, copper!</i>

22:47.183 --> 22:49.811
<i>Don't, Johnny! No!</i>

22:50.820 --> 22:51.878
What a beautiful day!

22:54.090 --> 22:55.751
Wouldn’t you agree, ladies?

22:55.825 --> 22:57.190
Just drink your milk.

22:57.260 --> 22:58.249
Beautiful day?

22:59.095 --> 23:02.121
You can look at me all you want,
ladies, no problem with that.

23:02.198 --> 23:03.665
You got a problem, Bonnie?

23:03.733 --> 23:05.462
No, sir.

23:05.535 --> 23:09.403
Well, okay. If there are no problems,
then what the fuck are you staring at?

23:09.472 --> 23:12.669
Look, we don't want
any trouble here.

23:12.742 --> 23:15.176
How about rustling up
Boo Boo's breakfast?

23:15.245 --> 23:16.735
I like that, Yogi.

23:16.813 --> 23:18.713
Smarter than
your average bear, eh, Boo Boo?

23:18.781 --> 23:21.716
Boo Boo. So silly.

23:22.785 --> 23:27.017
- What's your name, baby doll?
- Joanie.

23:29.092 --> 23:33.529
That's what you've been
drooling over so lustfully.

23:33.596 --> 23:34.620
Joanie.

23:36.166 --> 23:37.463
Ain't that cute.

23:37.534 --> 23:40.901
Little sad, too,
now I gotta be honest.

23:40.970 --> 23:43.905
Still wanna be
Mommy's little treasure?

23:43.973 --> 23:45.770
Am I right?

23:47.544 --> 23:51.913
Not quite ready to let go
of all your little girly yesterdays?

23:51.981 --> 23:55.940
Pretty soon, sweetie pie, you're
gonna have to give up all that shit

23:56.019 --> 23:59.955
when you join the festering parade
of tired old broads...

24:02.125 --> 24:06.061
the Bette Anns, the Mary Lous,
the Patsys, the Cindys...

24:07.063 --> 24:08.121
the Bonnies.

24:09.232 --> 24:10.961
Just talking about you.

24:11.034 --> 24:12.228
Come on, get a move on!

24:12.302 --> 24:14.099
Boo Boo tends to get a little snarly

24:14.170 --> 24:16.138
when he hasn't eaten,
right, Boo Boo?

24:17.574 --> 24:22.511
So we got the Joanies,
the Bonnies, and we got the Bettes.

24:22.579 --> 24:24.809
How you doing, old gal?

24:24.881 --> 24:26.473
It is Bette, isn't it?

24:26.549 --> 24:27.709
Not "Bett"?

24:27.784 --> 24:29.411
And her name's Gina, right?

24:29.485 --> 24:31.077
Good morning.

24:31.154 --> 24:34.180
Or should I say, good afternoon.

24:39.128 --> 24:40.117
Hello.

24:43.533 --> 24:45.330
What's your problem, pointy head?

24:45.401 --> 24:46.493
Got no problems.

24:47.604 --> 24:49.128
Then what are you staring at?

24:49.205 --> 24:50.729
Nothing.

24:50.807 --> 24:53.867
Heck of a lot of staring going on
in this place, eh, Boo Boo?

24:53.943 --> 24:56.605
Makes me feel real itchy
and twitchy all over.

24:56.679 --> 24:58.010
You don't have to be sorry.

24:58.081 --> 25:01.949
Be conscientious, be American,
with American values... industry, valor!

25:02.018 --> 25:03.508
That's what I like to see.

25:03.586 --> 25:05.816
That's all I ask
of my fellow Americans.

25:05.888 --> 25:07.219
"I am not a crook!"

25:08.458 --> 25:11.052
Bonnie, where's
my friend's breakfast?

25:11.127 --> 25:12.788
I'm just preparing it now.

25:12.862 --> 25:14.693
Good! Continue the preparation.

25:17.700 --> 25:20.294
- What is your name, pinead?
- Mel.

25:23.673 --> 25:25.664
That's an all-American name to me, Mel.

25:25.742 --> 25:28.370
Got a ring of authenticity.

25:28.444 --> 25:30.639
Kinda cracker barrel,
know what I mean?

25:30.713 --> 25:34.171
Chill Wills, Slim Pickens,
Andy Devine, and Big Mac Mel.

25:36.085 --> 25:38.178
Nice cozy little setup
you got here.

25:38.254 --> 25:43.385
Tell me something, if you're not
too much of a whacked-out old fairy:

25:43.459 --> 25:47.759
what exactly is your relationship
to sweet Bonnie Daydream, here?

25:47.830 --> 25:50.958
- Nothing.
- She your little piece of ass?

25:51.034 --> 25:53.059
I'm gonna keep my eye
on you, Mel baby.

25:54.871 --> 25:56.862
Bonnie, come on out.

26:00.510 --> 26:02.774
Mel, this way.

26:04.280 --> 26:07.545
Mel, let me introduce you
to Abe Geekman.

26:07.617 --> 26:10.211
His friends, and in this regard
I would count myself

26:10.286 --> 26:13.221
as one of his closest
and dearest buddies, call him Geek.

26:14.223 --> 26:15.212
Hi, gang.

26:15.291 --> 26:17.122
You okay, Geek,
ol' Snuggly Boo?

26:17.193 --> 26:20.390
Let's put up the Closed sign
on the old diner door

26:20.463 --> 26:22.488
and keep out
Mr. Forest Ranger, Boo Boo?

26:22.565 --> 26:25.056
- I sure did, Yogi.
- Smart little bear, Boo Boo.

26:25.134 --> 26:26.032
Come on.

26:32.542 --> 26:35.705
Now that we're all snug and cozy,
like... one, two, three, four,

26:35.778 --> 26:38.770
five, six, seven little peas in a pod...

26:38.848 --> 26:40.213
Speaking of pods reminds me:

26:40.283 --> 26:42.751
<i>you guys ever see
Invasion of the Body Snatchers?</i>

26:42.819 --> 26:45.151
Long time ago? Anyone?

26:46.189 --> 26:48.054
No? Never saw it.

26:48.124 --> 26:51.616
<i>How 'bout that, Geek? They never saw
Invasion of the Body Snatchers.</i>

26:51.694 --> 26:52.991
That is so sad.

26:53.062 --> 26:55.895
<i>Invasion of the Body Snatchers!
For pete's sake, never saw that?</i>

26:55.965 --> 26:58.297
- It's a great movie.
- Kevin McCan'thy was the star.

26:58.368 --> 27:00.632
- And Dana Wynter.
- Oh, beautiful Dana...

27:00.703 --> 27:02.227
What's with you people?

27:02.305 --> 27:05.069
It's Geek's favorite movie.
We watch it every Thanksgiving.

27:05.141 --> 27:07.575
And Fourth of July.
See, it stars Kevin McCan'thy.

27:07.643 --> 27:10.168
He was a big star
back in the '50s,

27:10.246 --> 27:12.578
and I met him once
in New York a long time ago.

27:12.648 --> 27:14.138
You never told me that, Geek.

27:14.217 --> 27:16.685
Yeah, he gave me his autograph,
gave me a picture.

27:16.753 --> 27:18.846
Lucky son of a gun.

27:18.921 --> 27:22.482
He amazes and astonishes me,
my old pal.

27:23.493 --> 27:26.291
You're a regular old sly boots,
aren't you?

27:27.830 --> 27:28.854
Look at him.

27:28.931 --> 27:32.765
He's blushing,
like "Aw, shucks" blushing.

27:32.835 --> 27:36.362
My old pal, a real sly boots.

27:38.941 --> 27:40.033
Anyway.

27:50.953 --> 27:52.147
Where was I?

27:52.221 --> 27:55.713
Body snatchers, these people
lived in giant pea pods, you see?

27:55.792 --> 27:58.124
<i>- Dinner's ready.
- The movie is about</i>

27:58.194 --> 28:01.493
these pod people
who invade us from outer space.

28:01.564 --> 28:04.032
Right, these creatures,
these parasites,

28:04.100 --> 28:05.465
'cause that's what they are.

28:05.535 --> 28:07.400
Goddamn parasites.

28:07.470 --> 28:10.871
These parasites take over the bodies
and souls of fellow travelers,

28:10.940 --> 28:13.773
- good, decent people.
- Compassionate, caring, sharing,

28:13.843 --> 28:14.901
like you and me.

28:14.977 --> 28:17.309
Men, women,
piddling old grandpappies,

28:17.380 --> 28:20.372
- decaffeinated pussies.
- You and me.

28:20.450 --> 28:21.974
Decaffeinated pussies.

28:22.051 --> 28:24.679
- Men and women...
- Uncle Ira mowing his lawn.

28:24.754 --> 28:27.518
And all the Aunt Beas
from all the Mayberrys.

28:27.590 --> 28:30.718
- Talk show hosts and anchormen...
- Geek.

28:30.793 --> 28:32.055
Sorry, anchorpersons.

28:32.128 --> 28:33.823
- He is so bad.
- Sorry, folks.

28:33.896 --> 28:38.993
<i>People like Larry King Live,
Barbara Walters, Diane Sawyer,</i>

28:39.068 --> 28:41.434
Dan Rather, Paula Zahn,

28:41.504 --> 28:43.404
Katie Couric, Martha Stewart.

28:43.473 --> 28:46.408
- Everyone from Oprah to...
- Donald Trump.

28:46.476 --> 28:48.876
Fire!

28:54.617 --> 28:56.915
They take over the bodies
and souls of people,

28:56.986 --> 28:58.214
and you know what?

29:00.122 --> 29:03.455
They become them.

29:03.526 --> 29:05.517
First we had the Trekkies...

29:05.595 --> 29:07.722
...now we have the Poddies...

29:08.865 --> 29:11.060
and they run
the whole goddamn show.

29:11.133 --> 29:12.998
- You want to know why?
- Why?

29:13.069 --> 29:16.038
'Cause they are mainstream.

29:17.473 --> 29:18.633
Mainstream.

29:18.708 --> 29:20.471
That's not the real deal, right?

29:20.543 --> 29:22.170
Better believe it, old son.

29:23.179 --> 29:24.806
Mainstream. Gee whiz.

29:24.881 --> 29:26.280
But Kevin is on to them.

29:26.349 --> 29:28.476
Let us make no mistake.
Let it be understood.

29:28.551 --> 29:29.813
Our Kevin is on to them.

29:29.886 --> 29:31.080
Science, science...

29:31.153 --> 29:32.643
Have no fear about Kevin.

29:32.722 --> 29:34.553
Kevin is one smart cookie.

29:34.624 --> 29:36.319
No flies on our Kevin.

29:36.392 --> 29:37.984
Reporting for duty.

29:38.060 --> 29:39.823
Yes...

29:47.570 --> 29:48.559
What?

29:48.638 --> 29:50.902
Don't forget about
the problem, Ray.

29:52.141 --> 29:53.165
Problem?

29:53.242 --> 29:55.574
He has to stay awake.

29:57.146 --> 29:58.272
Right.

29:59.415 --> 30:00.882
He has to stay awake.

30:00.950 --> 30:02.008
That's his problem.

30:06.722 --> 30:08.280
<i>- Felix!
- Dinner's ready.</i>

30:08.357 --> 30:09.949
Once you fall asleep,
they get you!

30:10.026 --> 30:11.755
- Parasites.
- Run, critters!

30:11.827 --> 30:14.318
That's it, shazam,
pop goes the weasel.

30:14.397 --> 30:15.989
- What?
- Pop goes the weasel.

30:16.065 --> 30:17.828
It almost happens
to our Kevin.

30:17.900 --> 30:19.299
Yeah, he's gotta stay awake.

30:19.368 --> 30:22.769
You wanna know why?
Because they are mainstream, baby!

30:24.574 --> 30:26.565
You've already done that bit.

30:26.642 --> 30:29.372
- What?
- You've already done that bit.

30:29.445 --> 30:31.606
Well, I'm doing it again, okay?

30:31.681 --> 30:33.774
- Okay.
- Okay?!

30:36.519 --> 30:38.953
If you're so smart, Boo Boo,
why don't you tell them?

30:39.021 --> 30:42.047
Well, no, you tell them.
You tell it much better than I do.

30:42.124 --> 30:44.149
It's so hot in here.
It's like a goddamn furnace.

30:44.226 --> 30:46.319
The air conditioning
is broken, baby.

30:46.395 --> 30:49.023
- What!
- She said the air conditioner is broken.

30:49.098 --> 30:50.861
Why don't you go in there?
It's cooler.

30:50.933 --> 30:53.493
Give us a break,
for pete's sake.

30:53.703 --> 30:57.161
You were telling us
why Kevin has to stay awake.

30:57.239 --> 31:00.800
Ever since he was an itsy-bitsy
little snot-nosed kid,

31:00.876 --> 31:03.367
our Kevin had bought
the whole stupid fairy tale,

31:03.446 --> 31:06.506
hook, line, sinker, and the grand piano,
you know what I mean?

31:06.582 --> 31:07.571
Hello?

31:07.650 --> 31:10.175
Suddenly he became
a grassroots goody two-shoes,

31:10.252 --> 31:14.780
a noble champion of non-profit
advocacy organizations, etc., etc.

31:14.857 --> 31:15.983
And why?

31:16.058 --> 31:19.721
Because it made him feel
kind of cozy and mushy inside.

31:19.795 --> 31:21.956
You know the feeling.

31:22.031 --> 31:28.266
But sadly, Kevin, our hero,
had these core issues to deal with.

31:28.337 --> 31:31.397
You've all heard about core issues?
Sure you have.

31:31.474 --> 31:34.841
Kevin had tons of these things
all buzzing around inside him,

31:34.910 --> 31:38.073
because secretly
he knew the truth.

31:38.147 --> 31:42.106
He'd sort of cottoned on
to the big, fat Huckleberry Finn lie

31:42.184 --> 31:44.311
that runs our world
and as a result,

31:44.387 --> 31:46.685
he became bipolar,

31:46.756 --> 31:50.453
had problems with rage
and so on and so forth.

31:52.695 --> 31:54.686
Poor schmuck couldn't relate.

31:56.932 --> 31:58.422
And that's awful.

31:58.501 --> 32:01.698
Poor schmuck probably
should've married Dana Wynter.

32:01.771 --> 32:03.363
- Yeah, right.
- Know what I mean?

32:04.373 --> 32:07.570
Dana could've got him
through his stuff, you know,

32:07.643 --> 32:10.407
got him to clean up
his side of the street, you know?

32:11.614 --> 32:12.603
<i>Hello?</i>

32:12.682 --> 32:14.980
She also had her own stuff
that kept coming up.

32:16.485 --> 32:18.077
What time is it?

32:18.154 --> 32:20.918
Let's make no mistake about that.

32:22.558 --> 32:24.788
Let it be understood!

32:24.860 --> 32:29.422
- Hey... that's my line.
- So?

32:29.498 --> 32:31.659
You stomped all over
my train of thought,

32:31.734 --> 32:33.258
you stupid son of a bitch.

32:33.335 --> 32:35.360
You stomped all over
my keynote speech.

32:35.438 --> 32:38.430
This is supposed to be
my stupid keynote speech!

32:38.507 --> 32:39.974
- I'll kill you!
- I'm sorry.

32:40.042 --> 32:42.101
- Jesus Christ!
- What does he want from us?

32:42.178 --> 32:43.736
- It's Bette?
- What do I want from you?

32:43.813 --> 32:45.678
- Her name's Gina.
- How does he know our names?

32:45.748 --> 32:47.477
- You write this shit, dude?
- I'm bipolar.

32:47.550 --> 32:49.108
Oh, I'm bipolar. Are you bipolar?

32:49.185 --> 32:50.482
I'm bipolar. I'm a schmuck.

32:50.553 --> 32:52.418
I'm a schmuck,
and I'm bipolar.

32:52.488 --> 32:54.217
- He was a...
- I'm Boo Boo. I'm bipolar.

32:54.290 --> 32:55.518
He's also co-dependent.

32:55.591 --> 32:57.525
I'm Boo Boo.
I'm the bipolar bear.

32:57.593 --> 32:59.652
- Very funny.
- I'm the bipolar bear!

32:59.729 --> 33:02.357
- Adult child of alcoholics.
- Stop this!

33:02.431 --> 33:04.695
- Stop doing this!
- Would you shut the fuck up!

33:04.767 --> 33:05.791
Cool it!

33:24.253 --> 33:26.949
- This is boring.
- I'm hungry.

33:32.895 --> 33:34.487
Hey, Matt, Matt, are you okay?

33:34.563 --> 33:35.825
What do I say next?

33:35.898 --> 33:37.525
"It's quite simple, really."

33:37.600 --> 33:39.227
I know that. What comes next?

33:39.301 --> 33:41.064
- Cut, cut.
- Cut. Let's cut.

33:41.737 --> 33:42.897
Burt, come on, wake up!

33:42.972 --> 33:44.735
Matt, you're killing us.

33:44.807 --> 33:47.605
Okay, back to first positions,
everyone. Burt!

33:49.578 --> 33:51.910
- Put on the air conditioning!
- What do I say next?

33:51.981 --> 33:53.573
Boo Boo! I'm Boo Boo.

33:53.649 --> 33:55.583
- Going down.
- Wait for the camera, folks.

33:59.388 --> 34:01.481
- Matt. Matt just went down.
- What's going on?

34:02.725 --> 34:04.693
- Shouldn’t you get the...
- I have no idea...

34:04.760 --> 34:06.523
He went down, huh?
I'm hungry.

34:06.595 --> 34:08.152
Jesus, now what?

34:09.364 --> 34:10.389
He's nuts.

34:10.466 --> 34:11.455
Matt?

34:12.234 --> 34:13.326
Grab his arms.

34:13.402 --> 34:15.335
Actors.

34:21.476 --> 34:23.069
Real nice!

34:23.145 --> 34:24.772
Watch his head!

34:24.847 --> 34:26.746
Oh, I can't feel my face!

34:26.815 --> 34:29.216
Let's loosen his shirt. Breathe!

34:29.284 --> 34:30.877
- Let's break for lunch.
- Give him air.

34:30.953 --> 34:32.681
Break for lunch, everyone!

34:33.789 --> 34:35.518
One hour, everyone.

34:35.591 --> 34:37.855
You! You want my part.

34:37.927 --> 34:39.757
I don't want your part.
Want some water?

34:39.829 --> 34:41.262
I don't want any water!

34:41.330 --> 34:43.355
- Let him breathe.
- You don't have to have water.

34:44.800 --> 34:47.098
- Can we get Monica in here, please?
- Who's Monica?

34:47.168 --> 34:49.728
- The production nurse.
- She's never here when you need her.

34:49.804 --> 34:52.706
- I'll get her.
- Try craft service. She's usually there.

34:52.775 --> 34:54.402
- All right.
- Thanks, Bonnie.

34:54.476 --> 34:56.603
- I need an ice pack.
- Come on.

34:56.679 --> 34:59.239
- Does it still hurt?
- Yeah. Shit, it still hurts.

34:59.315 --> 35:01.681
Abby, I need you to get me
an ice pack for Gavin.

35:01.750 --> 35:04.150
- I just gotta figure out where...
- Give him to me.

35:04.220 --> 35:07.587
You can't work like this anymore.
You're driving everybody crazy.

35:07.656 --> 35:09.123
- I know that.
- Come here.

35:09.191 --> 35:10.419
Come here, Michael.

35:10.492 --> 35:11.584
My good little...

35:11.660 --> 35:13.252
How are you, sweetie?

35:13.329 --> 35:15.991
Jennifer, can you call Marcia,
the baby's mom,

35:16.065 --> 35:18.829
and tell her that she needs
to come down here ASAP?

35:18.901 --> 35:20.835
- Right this second.
- Well, where is she?

35:20.903 --> 35:22.803
Probably at the motel
sunning her ass. Go!

35:22.872 --> 35:23.930
Okay, calm down.

35:24.006 --> 35:25.405
I am calm!

35:25.474 --> 35:27.135
You're pulling my chest hairs!

35:27.209 --> 35:28.198
Listen to me!

35:28.277 --> 35:30.404
You are the leader.
I need you to act like one.

35:30.479 --> 35:31.571
You're hurting my nipp...

35:31.647 --> 35:34.309
From now on, you are gonna do
what I say, you understand?

35:34.383 --> 35:35.372
Yes.

35:35.451 --> 35:38.511
We are printing the second take.
We are printing the two last takes.

35:38.587 --> 35:40.578
We need to match that last take

35:40.656 --> 35:42.647
with the milk spilled
and the oatmeal,

35:42.725 --> 35:46.354
and then when we come back from
lunch, we're gonna do a pick-up shot.

35:46.428 --> 35:48.453
Yes, I get it, I get it.
I get it!

35:49.465 --> 35:51.023
You are such an infant.

35:51.100 --> 35:53.000
You're a baby!

35:53.068 --> 35:54.660
Very touchy, isn't he?

35:54.737 --> 35:56.602
<i>Gavin, go down
to the production trailer.</i>

35:56.672 --> 35:57.696
Whoopsy daisy.

35:57.773 --> 35:59.206
Drop dead, Lars.

35:59.275 --> 36:00.674
I love you too!

36:02.878 --> 36:04.368
Evan. Evan, darling...

36:04.446 --> 36:05.777
- It's Gavin!
- Sorry, sweetie.

36:05.848 --> 36:08.510
Listen, Evan, what are we
going to do about this wig?

36:08.584 --> 36:10.950
- I mean, it doesn't even match...
- I don't care!

36:11.020 --> 36:13.420
- What!
- Please excuse me for breathing!

36:13.489 --> 36:15.616
Gavin, I'm really sorry
that I came in on that line,

36:15.691 --> 36:17.556
but I don't know
what's going on around here.

36:17.626 --> 36:19.287
- Who does?
- What line?

36:19.361 --> 36:20.726
"Stop it! Stop doing this!"

36:20.796 --> 36:22.627
I thought Mort
was gonna do that line.

36:22.698 --> 36:24.256
No, that changed last night.

36:24.333 --> 36:26.631
- Well, I didn't know!
- Well, you should've!

36:26.702 --> 36:28.294
You should've said something!

36:28.370 --> 36:31.396
- Come on, Florence Nightingale.
- Stop calling me that!

36:34.109 --> 36:36.976
The nurse is coming over now,
and you were right, Barbara,

36:37.046 --> 36:39.844
she was over there at craft service
just stuffing her face.

36:39.915 --> 36:40.939
Unbelievable.

36:41.016 --> 36:43.109
Hey, what are you doing?

36:43.185 --> 36:45.016
Looking at your continuity sheets,

36:45.087 --> 36:47.214
if that's what these
are supposed to be.

36:47.289 --> 36:48.688
You're such an asshole, Lars!

36:48.757 --> 36:50.418
I don't look through your shit.

36:50.492 --> 36:52.187
How's Marlon doing
out there, anyway?

36:52.261 --> 36:54.855
- Should we get a doctor, too?
- I'm gonna talk to Burt about it.

36:54.930 --> 36:57.660
Honey, oh! Honey, come here.

36:57.733 --> 36:59.462
- How do you feel?
- Get him a chair.

36:59.535 --> 37:01.765
Get him in the chair.
There we go.

37:01.837 --> 37:03.099
Back it in, back it in.

37:03.172 --> 37:04.867
I've done this before like this.

37:04.940 --> 37:05.929
Déjà vu.

37:07.209 --> 37:08.904
Should we start the scene
in the kitchen?

37:08.978 --> 37:12.175
We finished it, man.
We just have a pick-up shot.

37:12.247 --> 37:13.771
- We started the scene?
- Yeah.

37:13.849 --> 37:14.838
You were terrific.

37:14.917 --> 37:17.579
No, no, I didn't think
you'd started the scene yet.

37:17.653 --> 37:19.678
You scared the shit out of me.

37:19.755 --> 37:22.781
Hey, hey! If you ever touch me
that way again,

37:22.858 --> 37:24.257
I will eat your heart for lunch!

37:27.096 --> 37:28.461
What are you talking about?!

37:28.530 --> 37:31.021
Don't you touch me!
Don't anyone touch me!

37:31.100 --> 37:33.398
That's lunch, everyone!
One hour.

37:33.469 --> 37:34.458
One hour!

37:36.171 --> 37:38.969
I'm gonna be sick.
I'm gonna be sick, everyone!

37:39.041 --> 37:40.269
You need to lie down.

37:40.342 --> 37:43.004
- You want my part?
- Maybe we should all lie down.

37:43.078 --> 37:44.204
What happened, honey?

37:44.279 --> 37:45.541
He was overacting.

37:45.614 --> 37:48.310
Leave me alone!
Don't you understand?

37:48.384 --> 37:51.148
- Time's gone all weird...
- That's it. I'm outta here.

37:51.220 --> 37:52.949
Gotta get outta here!

37:53.022 --> 37:54.489
Oh, Jesus Christ!

37:54.556 --> 37:56.080
Anybody know what's for lunch?

37:56.158 --> 37:57.853
Get him to his trailer.
Come on.

38:00.763 --> 38:02.731
Buddy, I need to call a doctor.

38:02.798 --> 38:04.288
I need a cell phone, someone!

38:05.534 --> 38:08.002
You should have a fucking phone!

38:09.638 --> 38:11.401
That motherfucker!

38:11.473 --> 38:14.237
Did you see that?
He just grabbed my titties!

38:16.745 --> 38:18.906
This whole thing is going
to hell in a hand basket.

38:22.684 --> 38:24.982
Okay, so we're clear?
Pick-up shot after lunch?

38:25.054 --> 38:27.045
Yes, and we're gonna print
the last two takes.

38:27.122 --> 38:29.488
If it were up to me,
we'd do a safety of the whole scene.

38:29.558 --> 38:32.459
Anything for safety,
please, anything.

38:32.528 --> 38:35.326
Come on, Lars, please,
give me a break.

38:35.397 --> 38:37.695
I'm just kidding, old chum.
I'm just kidding.

38:37.766 --> 38:38.892
Are you?

38:38.967 --> 38:40.332
No.

38:41.336 --> 38:43.304
- Who loves you, baby?
- Stop it!

38:44.840 --> 38:46.467
Come on, sexy.

38:46.542 --> 38:48.169
Who's that woman?

38:48.243 --> 38:50.734
That's Lily. She's Russian.

38:50.813 --> 38:52.542
What's she doing on my set?

38:52.614 --> 38:54.548
Gavin, she financed half your film.

38:54.616 --> 38:57.050
- That's why she wants a bigger part?
- Yeah.

38:57.119 --> 38:58.313
What's she doing with Lars?

38:58.387 --> 39:00.981
Giving him aid and sustenance
whenever he wants it.

39:02.391 --> 39:04.621
Shit, directing sucks!
Where's my wife?

39:04.693 --> 39:07.184
I'm here. Where's the baby?

39:07.262 --> 39:09.355
- Jennifer has him.
- Where were you?

39:09.431 --> 39:12.730
I was out buying diapers for him
and baby wipes for you, bonehead.

39:12.801 --> 39:14.962
Oh, that's funny.
That's really funny!

39:15.037 --> 39:16.732
Gavin.

39:16.805 --> 39:19.706
I'm sor... I'm sorry. Sorry.

39:23.045 --> 39:25.343
That's 45 minutes, people.

39:25.514 --> 39:27.277
Back at 4:00. Back at 4:00!

39:27.349 --> 39:28.976
Back at 4:00, copy that!

39:30.652 --> 39:31.983
Gavin, this is Dr. Cohen.

39:32.054 --> 39:34.420
Hi, Dr. Stuart Cohen.
Can we talk a moment, please?

39:34.490 --> 39:36.014
- What's up?
- Privately.

39:37.993 --> 39:40.223
- What's going on?
- What's the problem?

39:46.001 --> 39:47.195
- Dead?
- Yeah.

39:47.269 --> 39:48.258
I don't believe it.

39:48.337 --> 39:50.271
Yeah, I don't know what to say. It was...

39:50.339 --> 39:51.328
What happened?

39:51.406 --> 39:54.603
It could have been
severe heat stroke, heart, anything.

39:54.676 --> 39:56.644
I took Dr. Cohen to Ray's trailer...

39:56.712 --> 39:58.236
Yeah, he was lying down there...

39:58.313 --> 39:59.905
- Who was laying down?
- What?

39:59.982 --> 40:02.007
- Who was laying down?
- Matt, Matt Dobbs.

40:02.084 --> 40:03.608
Right, and he didn't look good.

40:03.685 --> 40:06.347
I asked him to sit up.
I needed to get his blood pressure.

40:06.421 --> 40:07.410
I gave him some water.

40:07.489 --> 40:10.583
I turned around to get my stuff,
and he had collapsed onto the floor.

40:10.659 --> 40:13.059
It was awful.
I called an ambulance.

40:13.128 --> 40:14.425
Are you sure he's dead?

40:14.496 --> 40:17.226
What do you mean?
Of course I'm sure. I'm a doctor.

40:17.299 --> 40:19.529
He's dead, extremely dead.

40:19.601 --> 40:21.694
Okay, so what do we do now?

40:21.770 --> 40:25.001
There's gonna have to be an autopsy,
coroner's report, all the procedures.

40:25.073 --> 40:28.133
Did he have an insurance medical
before you started filming?

40:28.210 --> 40:29.302
I guess so.

40:29.378 --> 40:31.869
Did he or didn't he?
Don't you people check this out?

40:31.947 --> 40:33.778
I don't know.
Don't get in my face!

40:33.849 --> 40:35.214
Gavin, calm down!

40:35.284 --> 40:38.412
All I'm saying is they have
strict laws up here in Nevada.

40:38.487 --> 40:42.116
I'm sure they do.
Dr. Cohen, I'm Jeffrey, by the way.

40:42.191 --> 40:44.056
I'm an actor in the film,
and this is...

40:44.126 --> 40:45.593
Bonnie.

40:45.661 --> 40:47.686
...Gavin, but he's a little stressed.

40:47.763 --> 40:50.459
Okay, but hell, he doesn't
have to jump down my throat.

40:50.532 --> 40:52.523
Does he have a family
or relatives?

40:52.601 --> 40:54.592
Yeah, I have a wife and a child.

40:55.871 --> 40:58.897
- He means Matt.
- Matt?

40:58.974 --> 41:01.374
You know, the deceased?
What's his name, Dobbs?

41:01.443 --> 41:02.637
Does he have a family?

41:02.711 --> 41:05.339
Yes, he does. He has a wife
and two young kids.

41:05.414 --> 41:06.676
I think they're divorced.

41:06.748 --> 41:09.410
- His kids are divorced?
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

41:10.852 --> 41:14.515
Do you laugh at everything?
I mean, a man has died.

41:14.590 --> 41:16.581
She thinks this is funny.

41:18.694 --> 41:21.185
- Are all you movie people like this?
- Go, go!

41:21.263 --> 41:22.662
Who's in charge of things?

41:22.731 --> 41:23.925
I'm the director.

41:23.999 --> 41:26.467
- You've gotta be kidding.
- He is, doc.

41:26.535 --> 41:29.595
He's in charge.
We can all vouch for that.

41:29.671 --> 41:32.333
- Who the hell was that?
- That was the production asshole.

41:32.407 --> 41:34.773
I thought as much.
Is there a producer around here?

41:34.843 --> 41:37.835
Well, no. He's in LA.
His name is Harvey Brickman.

41:37.913 --> 41:40.347
I'm gonna have to talk to him.

41:40.415 --> 41:43.407
You know what, I'm gonna call
Harvey and break the news.

41:43.485 --> 41:45.953
- I'll wait for the ambulance.
- I'll go with you.

41:46.021 --> 41:47.648
No, it's okay. Go to lunch.

41:47.723 --> 41:49.122
Copy that.

41:52.227 --> 41:53.216
Gavin!

41:54.229 --> 41:55.355
Your ice pack.

42:05.440 --> 42:07.374
Why has he got
that ice pack on his knee?

42:07.442 --> 42:09.842
He had an accident
surfing over in Malibu.

42:09.911 --> 42:10.900
He surfs?

42:10.979 --> 42:12.003
Oh, yeah.

42:12.114 --> 42:13.843
<i>- Harvey Brickmars office.
- Harvey.</i>

42:13.915 --> 42:15.143
<i>- He's not here.
- Where is he?</i>

42:15.217 --> 42:17.412
<i>- Would you like me to try his cell?
- Put me through!</i>

42:17.486 --> 42:19.010
God!

42:20.088 --> 42:21.555
He's on medication, isn't he?

42:22.691 --> 42:24.022
He's on everything.

42:24.092 --> 42:25.821
Thought as much.

42:25.894 --> 42:27.384
Vicodin?

42:27.462 --> 42:29.054
Yeah.

42:29.131 --> 42:30.655
Yeah, you got it.

42:31.667 --> 42:33.862
That's why he's wacko.

42:33.935 --> 42:35.527
He's wacko?

42:35.604 --> 42:37.435
Hello.

42:37.506 --> 42:38.973
Hey, Harvey, it's Gavin.

42:39.041 --> 42:40.474
<i>- Marvin?
- Gavin.</i>

42:40.542 --> 42:42.203
<i>- Gavin?
- That's right.</i>

42:42.277 --> 42:44.040
I'm directing one of your films.

42:44.112 --> 42:46.137
<i>- Which one?
- Slipstream.</i>

42:46.214 --> 42:47.841
Yeah, out here in the desert.

42:47.916 --> 42:51.079
<i>- Garvin?
- Gavin, not Garvin.</i>

42:51.153 --> 42:52.916
<i>- Right, no, I'm directing...
- Hot?</i>

42:52.988 --> 42:54.751
<i>- It's very hot out here.
- Where?</i>

42:54.823 --> 42:55.983
<i>- Near Vegas.
- Vegas?</i>

42:56.058 --> 42:58.185
Listen, Harvey,
we have a problem.

42:58.260 --> 43:00.285
Actually, we have
a very big problem.

43:00.362 --> 43:02.193
One of your actors, Matt Dobbs,

43:02.264 --> 43:04.664
well, he collapsed
about an hour ago...

43:04.733 --> 43:05.722
<i>Who's he?</i>

43:08.136 --> 43:09.125
Playing...

43:09.204 --> 43:11.035
Well, he's dead.

43:11.106 --> 43:14.132
What do you mean? He can't die.
We're in the middle of a movie.

43:14.209 --> 43:15.972
Nobody dies until I tell 'em to die.

43:16.044 --> 43:18.205
<i>- It could've been a heart...
- Heart attack!</i>

43:18.280 --> 43:21.340
Hiya, Francis!
How you doing?

43:21.416 --> 43:24.544
You. Call me.
We'll have dinner.

43:27.789 --> 43:28.778
<i>Or heat exhaustion.</i>

43:28.857 --> 43:31.257
What do you mean,
heat exhaustion?!

43:31.326 --> 43:32.793
<i>We're already three weeks in.</i>

43:32.861 --> 43:36.262
What do you want me to do, recast?
You're breaking up, Harvey.

43:36.331 --> 43:38.231
You'd break up
if you had my problems.

43:38.300 --> 43:40.860
We can't recast.
Jeez, what's the matter with you?

43:40.936 --> 43:43.404
John! John, take this away.
It's rubbish!

43:43.472 --> 43:45.736
<i>- What should I do?
- How the hell should I know?</i>

43:45.807 --> 43:48.173
You're the director!
Do a rewrite!

43:48.243 --> 43:50.143
Everybody wants to be
a writer these days.

43:50.212 --> 43:51.577
<i>- What should I do!
- I don't know.</i>

43:51.646 --> 43:53.637
Get somebody
from catering to do it,

43:53.715 --> 43:55.740
maybe transpo,
just get on with it.

43:55.817 --> 43:57.648
- Get on with what?
- What?

43:57.719 --> 43:59.380
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

43:59.454 --> 44:02.184
Could you come up here?
We've got no line producer or anything.

44:02.257 --> 44:03.417
Shut it down.

44:03.492 --> 44:06.586
Okay, I'll shut down production
this afternoon. Great.

44:06.661 --> 44:08.128
You have my cell phone number.

44:08.196 --> 44:10.289
Actually, production
has my cell phone.

44:10.365 --> 44:12.458
Or you could call
my hotel in Vegas.

44:12.534 --> 44:15.970
<i>Well, it's not really in Vegas.
It's actually a motel... hello?</i>

44:16.037 --> 44:17.470
Hello, Harvey?

44:35.857 --> 44:37.324
Hey, Gav, catch!

44:37.392 --> 44:39.292
Where the hell am I?

44:39.361 --> 44:41.829
- Matt Dobbs just died.
- Who's he?

44:41.897 --> 44:42.955
He's an actor.

44:43.031 --> 44:44.555
He was your bright idea,
wasn't he?

44:44.633 --> 44:46.123
What do I know?
I'm just the writer.

44:46.201 --> 44:48.829
You'd better get up there
to the desert and do a rewrite

44:48.904 --> 44:50.701
before some other idiot
gets hold of it.

44:53.775 --> 44:55.367
Very nice to meet you.

45:02.417 --> 45:03.941
So unprofessional.

45:04.019 --> 45:05.077
Hey, Gav!

45:05.153 --> 45:07.519
- Okay, this is the situation.
- Evan, darling.

45:07.589 --> 45:10.353
This is what the deal is.
We're shutting down production.

45:10.425 --> 45:12.825
- Harvey is coming up on Monday.
- That should be lots of fun.

45:12.894 --> 45:16.057
And what are we supposed to do,
Superman, sit around and wait?

45:16.131 --> 45:18.156
I'm not sure
what the legal deal is in this case.

45:18.233 --> 45:20.565
- Will you recast?
- Don't even say that word.

45:20.635 --> 45:23.263
- Harvey wants to do a rewrite.
- You're bringing the writer up here?

45:23.338 --> 45:25.966
- Yes, we're gonna do a rewrite.
- I'm down with that.

45:26.041 --> 45:28.601
Oh, you would say that, Jeffrey.
You're so nice.

45:28.677 --> 45:30.508
- So nice!
- We need a rewrite.

45:30.579 --> 45:32.638
I have no idea what
I'm doing in this thing.

45:32.714 --> 45:34.682
You need to bring
the real writer up here.

45:34.749 --> 45:37.115
- Yes, the real writer.
- Do we get paid?

45:37.185 --> 45:39.745
Yeah, well, speak to your agent.
Call your agent.

45:39.821 --> 45:43.723
You don't understand, man.
I have to be paid. I need the money.

45:43.792 --> 45:46.124
Well, what's that thing called, force...

45:46.194 --> 45:47.627
<i>Force major.</i>

45:47.696 --> 45:49.891
He knows that.
He knows everything.

45:49.965 --> 45:52.456
Bette, here's an idea.
Why don't you have a drink?

45:52.534 --> 45:55.435
I gotta be paid. I'm gonna get
a deputy on the set!

45:55.504 --> 45:58.564
Oh, babycakes, you're gonna get paid.
Don't worry your little head.

45:58.640 --> 46:02.269
Mommy'll look after that.
Mommy'll look after that.

46:02.344 --> 46:04.471
Bette, will you go fuck yourself?

46:06.381 --> 46:07.780
You too, darling.

46:07.849 --> 46:10.875
And that girly horse
you rode into town on...

46:12.454 --> 46:14.217
Why don't you just drop dead?

46:15.390 --> 46:18.655
I've enough of this shit!
I'm gonna get a lawyer.

46:18.727 --> 46:21.252
I think it's a pretty healthy group.
What about you?

46:21.329 --> 46:22.557
I'll sue their ass.

46:23.999 --> 46:25.933
Burt, can we see dailies tonight?

46:26.001 --> 46:28.299
I don't know, Gav.
The projector's broken.

46:28.370 --> 46:30.838
- Like everything else on this movie.
- Any other questions?

46:30.906 --> 46:33.568
- Yeah, I got a question.
- Yeah, Lars?

46:33.642 --> 46:35.473
Who wrote this piece of crap?

46:37.178 --> 46:38.440
You guys figure it out.

46:40.248 --> 46:42.978
Yeah, baby!

47:43.578 --> 47:46.308
My God, this place
must be a million years old.

48:32.661 --> 48:33.923
Will that be it, sweetie?

48:33.995 --> 48:36.054
I think this gentlemans next.

48:36.131 --> 48:38.929
No, sir. You're next.

48:39.000 --> 48:40.092
Thank you.

48:41.936 --> 48:44.302
That'll be $1.35.

48:44.372 --> 48:45.396
What?

48:45.473 --> 48:46.735
$1.35.

48:47.842 --> 48:49.810
- That's all?
- Did you want to pay more?

48:49.878 --> 48:52.039
No, it's just so cheap.

48:52.113 --> 48:55.708
That's the way it is out here,
sweetie, free and easy.

48:55.784 --> 49:00.414
Yes, sirree, home on the range
where the buffalo roam.

49:01.556 --> 49:03.251
The deer and the antelope play.

49:03.324 --> 49:06.293
Dolly's Little Diner.
Home from home.

49:06.361 --> 49:08.056
Home from home.

49:10.498 --> 49:11.556
What's your name?

49:11.633 --> 49:12.998
Dolly Parton Lookalike.

49:13.168 --> 49:14.601
Dolly Parton Lookalike.

49:16.071 --> 49:17.538
Dolly Parton Lookalike...

49:19.074 --> 49:20.336
My, my...

49:20.408 --> 49:21.773
Thank you very much.

49:26.181 --> 49:30.083
Have a good day,
and enjoy it.

49:31.252 --> 49:32.685
Catchy little tune, isn't it?

49:34.723 --> 49:35.781
Yeah.

49:37.459 --> 49:38.585
Thanks.

49:42.630 --> 49:44.063
Beautiful day.

49:45.166 --> 49:46.997
Yeah, you could say that again.

49:47.068 --> 49:48.057
<i>Beautiful day.</i>

49:48.136 --> 49:49.865
Waiting for your lady friend?

49:50.872 --> 49:52.169
Yes, I am.

49:53.608 --> 49:54.802
She'll be out soon.

50:05.754 --> 50:06.948
<i>- Hello.
- Hi.</i>

50:48.797 --> 50:50.059
<i>Mommy?</i>

51:23.932 --> 51:24.921
Felix?

51:26.801 --> 51:28.962
That bathroom was so gross
I couldn't use it.

51:29.037 --> 51:31.130
The place had flooded.
The john overflowed.

51:31.206 --> 51:33.367
There was stuff everywhere.
Are you okay?

51:34.375 --> 51:36.070
God, you look like
you saw a ghost.

51:36.144 --> 51:38.374
It's just the heat. I'm okay.
You all right?

51:38.446 --> 51:39.572
Yeah.

51:39.647 --> 51:41.274
Can I go behind the car?

51:41.349 --> 51:43.010
Yeah, why not?

51:43.084 --> 51:44.312
Okay, you stand guard.

51:44.385 --> 51:45.716
Yeah. What?

51:45.787 --> 51:47.254
Stand guard.

51:47.322 --> 51:49.722
- No peeking!
- Okay.

51:49.791 --> 51:50.917
<i>Hello.</i>

51:50.992 --> 51:53.392
Who's that man
you were talking to back there?

51:53.461 --> 51:54.450
I don't know.

51:54.529 --> 51:56.895
He said he thought
he knew me from someplace.

51:56.965 --> 51:58.626
He was kind of cute.

51:58.700 --> 52:00.463
That's better.

52:00.535 --> 52:01.968
Whose car is this?

52:02.036 --> 52:03.799
I don't know.

52:05.773 --> 52:07.502
Does it smell kind of funny?

52:07.575 --> 52:08.564
Yeah.

52:11.613 --> 52:12.637
Ready?

52:12.714 --> 52:13.840
- Yeah.
- Good.

52:13.915 --> 52:14.904
Let's go.

52:22.523 --> 52:24.286
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

52:45.747 --> 52:47.647
Hello, my friend.
We meet again.

52:47.715 --> 52:50.149
Could you possibly give me
a ride to Las Vegas?

52:50.218 --> 52:53.051
I fear that my car
is about to expire.

52:53.121 --> 52:56.386
I seem to be lost. I don't know
if this goes to Las Vegas.

52:56.457 --> 52:59.893
Oh, it does.
Take my word for it, yes sir.

52:59.961 --> 53:02.623
You're doing the right thing,
just a little off-track,

53:02.697 --> 53:04.062
but I can get us there.

53:04.132 --> 53:05.599
Good, then get in.

53:07.702 --> 53:11.570
To the land of Babylon
and fair fortune.

53:13.241 --> 53:15.539
I love the desert.

53:15.610 --> 53:18.909
You came into that diner
this afternoon, right?

53:18.980 --> 53:20.675
Way down there on the highway.

53:20.748 --> 53:22.045
We spoke briefly.

53:22.116 --> 53:23.811
Where's your girlfriend?

53:23.885 --> 53:25.477
She's in the back.
She's sleeping.

53:28.489 --> 53:30.923
Does she always sleep
with her eyes open?

53:30.992 --> 53:32.254
I never noticed.

53:32.327 --> 53:34.022
She's not my girlfriend.

53:34.095 --> 53:35.562
Oh, I apologize.

53:35.630 --> 53:39.361
"Not having seen the dawn,
I open every door."

53:39.434 --> 53:42.597
- You're Kevin McCan'thy, aren't you?
- That's what they tell me.

53:42.670 --> 53:44.137
I saw you in a great movie once.

53:44.205 --> 53:46.537
<i>It was called The Invasion
of the Body Snatchers.</i>

53:46.607 --> 53:47.972
Was I in that?

53:48.042 --> 53:49.839
Yeah, and Dana Wynter.

53:49.911 --> 53:52.379
She was your girlfriend,
and she was so beautiful.

53:52.447 --> 53:53.675
Indeed she was.

53:53.748 --> 53:55.943
- You were the hero.
- I was?

53:56.017 --> 53:57.746
Yeah.

53:57.819 --> 53:59.411
How do you like that!

54:21.609 --> 54:23.702
Why doesn't he listen to you...
what's his name?

54:23.778 --> 54:25.006
- Gavin.
- Right, Garvin.

54:25.079 --> 54:26.774
I can never remember his name.

54:29.384 --> 54:31.443
Morty! Morty!

54:31.519 --> 54:34.511
Yeah, where you been,
Morty baby, yeah?

54:34.589 --> 54:36.250
Yeah, I saw Francis yesterday.

54:36.324 --> 54:38.087
He looks terrific.

54:38.159 --> 54:40.024
You can't talk?
You with Bobby?

54:40.094 --> 54:42.085
And Leo! What, you having an orgy?

54:44.298 --> 54:47.233
I got you! I got you, you bastard!

54:47.301 --> 54:48.427
You call me, now!

54:48.503 --> 54:50.437
Call me! All right, don't forget.

54:50.505 --> 54:51.836
I love you more.

54:52.974 --> 54:54.908
So why doesn't he
listen to you?

54:54.976 --> 54:57.410
I tend to rattle his cage.
He doesn't like it.

54:57.478 --> 55:00.538
So was it like this before the actor...
what was his name... died?

55:00.615 --> 55:03.243
- Matt Dobbs.
- What was going on then?

55:03.317 --> 55:06.150
Anarchy.
Dobbs was rewriting the script.

55:06.220 --> 55:09.280
He'd call script conferences
every morning before shooting.

55:09.357 --> 55:10.483
It made everyone crazy.

55:10.558 --> 55:12.856
I thought we had a script!
What was the problem?

55:12.927 --> 55:15.691
He's an actor, what can I tell you.
He wasn't even good at it.

55:15.763 --> 55:18.755
He was the " look at me
scratch my balls" school of acting.

55:18.833 --> 55:20.198
They're all such assholes.

55:20.268 --> 55:22.793
I asked this guy, Matt Dobbs,
I asked him last week,

55:22.870 --> 55:25.134
- I said, "Why are you doing this?"
- What'd he say?

55:25.206 --> 55:27.037
He said it was a generational thing.

55:27.108 --> 55:30.009
- What's that mean?
- Beats the hell outta me.

55:30.078 --> 55:33.377
Little puke. Come on!

55:33.448 --> 55:35.416
You couldn't do anything to stop it?

55:35.483 --> 55:38.213
What could I do?
Gavin had no control.

55:39.320 --> 55:40.514
He was terrified.

55:40.588 --> 55:43.887
Couldn’t make decisions about
anything, even about breakfast.

55:43.958 --> 55:45.619
I could've helped him,
you know?

55:45.693 --> 55:50.062
Camera set-ups, lots of...
but he wouldn't listen.

55:50.131 --> 55:51.564
That's too bad.

55:52.467 --> 55:53.491
Dino!

55:53.568 --> 55:54.762
Dino, is that you, Dino?

55:54.836 --> 55:56.701
Dino! How you doing?

55:56.771 --> 55:59.968
<i>You doing Hannibal 4: Blue Dragon
with Hopkins? He's in or out?</i>

56:00.041 --> 56:01.508
He wants more money?
Fuck him.

56:01.576 --> 56:03.134
It's sad.

56:03.211 --> 56:05.270
He's a nice little guy
with a big heart.

56:05.346 --> 56:07.337
- What's his name?
- Gavin.

56:07.415 --> 56:09.883
I think he's trying
to prove himself somehow.

56:09.951 --> 56:12.852
Yeah, with big brother Mikey.

56:12.920 --> 56:15.286
Some hot shit producer,
richer than God,

56:15.356 --> 56:17.654
with three big awards
stuck up his ass.

56:17.725 --> 56:20.353
This poor schmuck's been trying
to get even all his life.

56:20.428 --> 56:22.419
Let's have lunch.
Enough with this garbage.

56:22.497 --> 56:25.728
Why do people play this game?
It is so boring!

56:25.800 --> 56:26.892
It eases tension.

56:26.968 --> 56:29.163
Well, I'd rather enjoy my tension.

56:29.237 --> 56:31.000
It gets things done!

56:31.072 --> 56:32.664
When does Bonoeffer get here?

56:32.740 --> 56:34.708
- I thought he was here!
- Maybe he is.

56:34.775 --> 56:36.936
I never know what the hell
that guy's talking about

56:37.011 --> 56:38.342
with his stupid accent.

56:38.412 --> 56:39.845
What is he, Icelandic?

56:39.914 --> 56:40.938
No, he's Welsh.

56:41.015 --> 56:42.983
Why do I always end up
with the space cadets?

56:43.050 --> 56:45.314
- Where you shooting tomorrow?
- Lucky Dice Motel.

56:45.386 --> 56:47.877
Let's start kicking some ass, man!

56:48.890 --> 56:51.757
Where's the director?!

56:53.361 --> 56:56.262
Let's get on with it!

56:58.366 --> 56:59.390
Cut, cut, cut!

57:01.936 --> 57:03.267
- Cut!
- That was cut.

57:04.805 --> 57:07.296
Hey, Harvey!
It's... well... I didn't know you were...

57:07.375 --> 57:09.900
Today's Monday, isn't it?
I'm sorry, but you got in the shot.

57:09.977 --> 57:11.877
What shot?
What are you talking about!

57:11.946 --> 57:14.744
The shot where Bette and Gina
leave the motel and go back to LA.

57:14.815 --> 57:17.045
Script check. Script check!

57:19.453 --> 57:21.546
There's no such scene!

57:21.622 --> 57:22.816
I'm in Room 419.

57:22.890 --> 57:25.358
You think that I was
born yesterday?

57:27.161 --> 57:28.458
Shut up!

57:28.529 --> 57:30.895
- Harvey...
- It's Mr. Brickman to you,

57:30.965 --> 57:33.957
you little putz!
What's that thing around your neck?

57:34.969 --> 57:37.062
It's my baby boy, actually,
Mr. Brickman.

57:37.138 --> 57:38.298
His name is Michael Joshua...

57:38.372 --> 57:43.002
I don't wanna know his name!
What's he doing around your neck?

57:43.077 --> 57:45.910
You try to direct my movie
with a baby around your neck?

57:45.980 --> 57:48.073
But my wife is suffering
from post-partum...

57:48.149 --> 57:50.276
- Post-what?!
- She can't cope.

57:50.351 --> 57:52.478
It's post-partum depression,
Mr. Brickman.

57:52.553 --> 57:53.815
It's like Brooke Shields.

57:53.888 --> 57:55.480
- Your brother was right!
- Brother?

57:55.556 --> 57:57.421
Yes, your big brother,
the producer.

57:57.491 --> 57:59.755
He said you're a loser, an idiot.
He's right!

57:59.827 --> 58:02.853
You bet your sweet ass
I'm right, Harvey!

58:02.930 --> 58:04.329
Mikey!

58:06.567 --> 58:08.467
Stop the car! Stop the car!

58:08.536 --> 58:10.265
I mean, you asked me
to do a rewrite...

58:10.338 --> 58:11.771
Harvey! Harvey!

58:11.839 --> 58:13.966
Ask the schmuck
about his knee surgery!

58:14.041 --> 58:15.565
- What?
- I had this knee surgery

58:15.643 --> 58:17.372
and that why I have
this titanium plate...

58:17.445 --> 58:20.778
Well, here's the darn card
that has the x-ray photo of it.

58:20.848 --> 58:23.146
It has my little...
this one gets me through

58:23.217 --> 58:25.481
clearances and concerts
of course, and...

58:31.626 --> 58:33.560
Why are you doing this to me?

58:33.628 --> 58:34.925
- I lost my way.
- Wake up.

58:41.902 --> 58:43.494
<i>Hello, Felix.</i>

58:51.479 --> 58:52.810
Are you ready, love?

58:54.448 --> 58:56.473
Let's go have some breakfast.

58:56.550 --> 58:58.484
<i>- Hi.
- Bonoeffer, is that your name?</i>

58:58.552 --> 59:00.782
- Yeah.
- Are you all right?

59:00.855 --> 59:02.083
Yeah.

59:03.524 --> 59:05.082
What are you looking at?

59:05.159 --> 59:07.389
Nothing.
Where'd you get that hat?

59:07.461 --> 59:10.692
You got this for me
last year in Texas.

59:10.765 --> 59:12.357
Don't you remember?

59:12.433 --> 59:13.695
Oh, yeah.

59:13.768 --> 59:16.566
Are you all right, love?

59:16.637 --> 59:19.401
Yeah, I'm fine.
Just a little tired, that's all.

59:19.473 --> 59:21.464
Aren't you gonna be hot
in this jacket?

59:21.542 --> 59:23.271
No, I'm all right.
I like being hot.

59:25.546 --> 59:26.843
Can we sit anywhere?

59:26.914 --> 59:29.508
- Anywhere you please, honey child.
- Thank you.

59:29.583 --> 59:30.948
<i>There he goes again.</i>

59:31.018 --> 59:32.485
Can we sit anywhere?

59:32.553 --> 59:35.044
- Anywhere you please, honey child.
- Thank you.

59:35.122 --> 59:37.215
Be with you in a moment.
Would you both like coffee?

59:37.291 --> 59:40.351
Latte, extra hot, no foam, please.

59:40.428 --> 59:41.861
Mr. Bonoeffer?

59:41.929 --> 59:43.260
I'd like an orange juice.

59:43.331 --> 59:45.060
- Mr. Bonoeffer?
- Yeah.

59:45.132 --> 59:47.760
Lars Munsen.
Cinematographer extraordinaire.

59:47.835 --> 59:49.803
Oh, hi.
You know my wife, Gina.

59:49.870 --> 59:52.668
Gina's been our moral support
in these troubled times.

59:52.740 --> 59:53.798
Oh, Lars.

59:53.874 --> 59:57.105
She's our lucky mascot.
Isn't that right, little one?

59:57.178 --> 59:58.202
Totally amazing.

59:58.279 --> 01:00:02.079
There you have it.
Totally phantasmagorically amazing.

01:00:02.149 --> 01:00:03.343
Thank you, Lars.

01:00:03.417 --> 01:00:04.714
I should have introduced you.

01:00:04.785 --> 01:00:06.582
This young beauty's
gonna be a movie star.

01:00:06.654 --> 01:00:10.090
She's my protégé. Her name's Lily.
She's from Russia.

01:00:10.157 --> 01:00:11.647
- Hi, Lily.
- Hi-Io.

01:00:19.433 --> 01:00:20.798
So, how is everything?

01:00:20.868 --> 01:00:22.699
Fantasia, old man.

01:00:22.770 --> 01:00:24.738
- Lunacy.
- That bad, huh?

01:00:24.805 --> 01:00:26.329
A looking glass world.

01:00:26.407 --> 01:00:27.999
Mad Hatter's tea party.

01:00:28.075 --> 01:00:29.303
Yeah?

01:00:29.377 --> 01:00:30.969
One orange juice.

01:00:31.078 --> 01:00:34.479
- Latte, no foam, sweetie pie.
- Thank you.

01:00:37.017 --> 01:00:38.609
It's my pleasure.

01:00:42.690 --> 01:00:44.487
- Who the hell was that?
- The waiter?

01:00:44.558 --> 01:00:45.820
That's Aaron.

01:00:46.827 --> 01:00:48.488
So, what's the latest development?

01:00:48.562 --> 01:00:50.052
You are, Mr. Bonoeffer.

01:00:50.131 --> 01:00:51.621
- I am?
- Of course.

01:00:51.699 --> 01:00:55.328
Hurtling up here from tired old
Tinseltown to rewrite our little saga.

01:00:55.403 --> 01:00:57.997
Maybe you can write me
a part, Mr. Bonoeffer.

01:00:58.072 --> 01:01:01.530
- Me too.
- Well, I'll give it a go.

01:01:01.609 --> 01:01:02.735
Oh, yes, please.

01:01:05.679 --> 01:01:07.840
Harvey's coming up
this afternoon, I believe.

01:01:07.915 --> 01:01:09.177
He's here.

01:01:09.250 --> 01:01:10.512
Flew in this morning.

01:01:10.584 --> 01:01:12.814
I doubt he'll help matters much.

01:01:12.887 --> 01:01:15.856
Harvey experiences road rage
even in the bathroom.

01:01:15.923 --> 01:01:18.551
Heads will tumble,
limbs will snap asunder,

01:01:18.626 --> 01:01:21.686
and many a tear will fall,
I have no doubt.

01:01:21.762 --> 01:01:24.196
Hi-ho, and merrily we go.

01:01:24.265 --> 01:01:26.028
Godspeed.

01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:27.965
Don't forget, now.

01:01:28.235 --> 01:01:29.600
See you guys later.

01:01:30.805 --> 01:01:31.863
Done with the paper?

01:01:31.939 --> 01:01:34.203
It's yours, old chum, all yours.

01:01:34.275 --> 01:01:35.367
Thanks.

01:01:35.443 --> 01:01:36.501
Bye.

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:41.375
So that's Lars Munsen, huh?

01:01:41.449 --> 01:01:43.349
Lars and Lily.

01:01:43.417 --> 01:01:44.975
What do you know.

01:01:49.356 --> 01:01:50.653
God, it's hot.

01:02:11.312 --> 01:02:13.109
This is where it all started.

01:02:15.850 --> 01:02:17.215
It's Bette, honey,

01:02:17.284 --> 01:02:19.718
your old friend, Bette Lustig.

01:02:19.787 --> 01:02:22.347
Bette, I've been looking
for you everywhere.

01:02:22.423 --> 01:02:23.788
I had something to tell you.

01:02:23.858 --> 01:02:27.350
I know, honey. Gina told me
you were looking for me.

01:02:27.428 --> 01:02:28.725
Gina?

01:02:30.931 --> 01:02:33.866
I can't remember
what it was I had to tell you.

01:02:33.934 --> 01:02:34.923
Look!

01:02:35.002 --> 01:02:37.664
Gina said you had
a spot of trouble, too.

01:02:37.738 --> 01:02:39.933
Remember?

01:02:40.007 --> 01:02:42.305
We drove up here three days ago.

01:02:42.376 --> 01:02:44.276
We're heading back
to LA tomorrow.

01:02:44.345 --> 01:02:45.676
You wanna come with us?

01:02:45.746 --> 01:02:47.976
<i>That's 45 minutes!</i>

01:02:49.183 --> 01:02:51.344
<i>Felix...</i>

01:02:51.418 --> 01:02:53.352
Are you okay, honey?

01:02:54.355 --> 01:02:55.515
<i>Don't think so.</i>

01:02:55.589 --> 01:02:58.285
Let's go and say hello to Gina.

01:02:58.359 --> 01:03:01.328
- Gina, yeah.
- You remember Gina, my niece.

01:03:01.395 --> 01:03:03.590
I think so.

01:03:03.664 --> 01:03:04.961
Of course you do.

01:03:05.032 --> 01:03:06.431
Are you in pain, honey?

01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:07.728
No, not anymore.

01:03:07.801 --> 01:03:09.496
- Gina.
- Hello.

01:03:09.570 --> 01:03:10.730
You remember Felix.

01:03:10.804 --> 01:03:11.998
Of course I do.

01:03:12.072 --> 01:03:13.334
- Hello.
- Hello, Gina.

01:03:13.407 --> 01:03:15.602
Would you like to join us
for tea or coffee?

01:03:15.676 --> 01:03:17.143
- No, I can't.
- No?

01:03:17.211 --> 01:03:19.076
Why not, honey?

01:03:19.146 --> 01:03:21.205
You look pale.
You have breakfast?

01:03:21.682 --> 01:03:22.944
I can't remember.

01:03:23.517 --> 01:03:25.314
Can't remember.

01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:29.284
- What's going on around here?
- What do you mean?

01:03:31.759 --> 01:03:33.590
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

01:03:33.661 --> 01:03:34.719
Don't do that, please.

01:03:34.795 --> 01:03:36.353
- Why not?
- 'Cause it hurts me.

01:03:36.430 --> 01:03:38.330
You shouldn't play
with the big boys.

01:03:38.399 --> 01:03:40.196
- Right, Gina?
- Word from the wise.

01:03:40.267 --> 01:03:42.792
- You're next.
- You should get a little rest.

01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:44.303
Yes, try to rest.

01:03:47.274 --> 01:03:49.708
<i>- Remember?
- I just feel so cold.</i>

01:03:50.177 --> 01:03:51.166
I feel so cold.

01:03:52.246 --> 01:03:53.713
Godspeed.

01:03:58.285 --> 01:04:01.254
They're making a movie
around here somewhere.

01:04:01.322 --> 01:04:02.414
So I've heard.

01:04:02.489 --> 01:04:05.981
I tried to get a part in it,
but with my reputation...

01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:09.359
I hear my friend Tracy
plays a very important part in it.

01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:10.897
Isn't that right, Felix?

01:04:10.965 --> 01:04:12.592
A very important part.

01:04:12.666 --> 01:04:14.099
Isn't that right, Felix?

01:04:14.168 --> 01:04:17.194
- Hello, Felix.
- Very important.

01:04:17.271 --> 01:04:18.499
Will you have tea with us?

01:04:30.384 --> 01:04:32.215
<i>I love the desert.</i>

01:04:33.754 --> 01:04:35.745
<i>Isn't it beautiful?</i>

01:04:35.823 --> 01:04:37.484
<i>I love the desert.</i>

01:04:37.558 --> 01:04:39.321
Don't look at the camera, Felix.

01:04:39.393 --> 01:04:42.294
Just be real. Like John Ford
said to Ben Johnson,

01:04:42.363 --> 01:04:44.797
"Just be real."
Isn't that right, Mr. Brickman?

01:04:44.865 --> 01:04:47.663
Beats the shit out of me.

01:04:47.735 --> 01:04:50.169
That is such a crock.

01:05:03.150 --> 01:05:04.845
Are we in a movie?

01:05:04.918 --> 01:05:06.647
Everything's a movie.

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:08.278
Talking pictures.

01:05:08.355 --> 01:05:11.051
- That's all it is.
- Talking pictures.

01:05:11.125 --> 01:05:12.854
Cheesy dreams...

01:05:12.926 --> 01:05:16.657
while Huckleberry Finn goes
fishing on the edge of the moon.

01:05:16.730 --> 01:05:18.129
Who's Ben Johnson?

01:05:18.198 --> 01:05:20.291
<i>He was in The Last Picture Show.</i>

01:05:20.367 --> 01:05:21.527
Just like us.

01:05:21.602 --> 01:05:25.470
- Don't move, my love. Be still.
- Be real.

01:05:29.576 --> 01:05:30.474
He's gone.

01:06:18.892 --> 01:06:21.656
You know, when my little Ruthie died,

01:06:21.729 --> 01:06:24.027
I'd look into that mirror and I'd say,

01:06:24.098 --> 01:06:26.066
"Bette, honey, this is it, girl.

01:06:26.133 --> 01:06:29.193
The show's on the road,
and you've got to get up and get at 'em."

01:06:29.269 --> 01:06:31.294
- It's so sad.
- Oh, I don't know.

01:06:31.371 --> 01:06:35.137
Something...
insurance or credit fraud,

01:06:35.209 --> 01:06:36.767
something like that, honey.

01:06:36.844 --> 01:06:41.304
<i>- How fast will your car go?
- In honest miles-an-hour...</i>

01:06:41.381 --> 01:06:42.780
I have to go now.

01:06:42.850 --> 01:06:44.977
I'll see you
tomorrow morning at 7:00.

01:06:45.052 --> 01:06:46.883
Okay. Thank you, dear.

01:06:46.954 --> 01:06:49.582
Are you sure you don't need me
to help you pack?

01:06:49.656 --> 01:06:50.714
No.

01:06:50.791 --> 01:06:52.224
What are you looking for?

01:06:52.292 --> 01:06:53.850
Are you okay?

01:06:53.927 --> 01:06:56.225
- Yeah.
- You take care of yourself.

01:06:57.998 --> 01:06:59.556
Take care.

01:07:00.834 --> 01:07:03.302
Okay. See you.

01:07:04.705 --> 01:07:05.967
I just...

01:07:06.039 --> 01:07:07.666
need to find my...

01:07:10.244 --> 01:07:11.575
money.

01:08:31.158 --> 01:08:32.716
What a moron!

01:08:43.170 --> 01:08:44.899
It's not too hot for you,
is it, lady?

01:08:44.971 --> 01:08:46.872
Oh, it is a bit.

01:08:46.939 --> 01:08:49.100
But it sure is beautiful out here.

01:08:49.176 --> 01:08:50.473
Pretty warm.

01:08:50.544 --> 01:08:53.341
I got us some candy bars.

01:08:53.412 --> 01:08:55.438
Hi. How you doing?

01:08:57.084 --> 01:08:59.518
Nuts, potato chips.

01:08:59.586 --> 01:09:01.076
Oh, good. That's great.

01:09:01.154 --> 01:09:03.987
- Have a nice day, sir.
- Thank you.

01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:18.133
Something bothering you, mister?

01:09:18.205 --> 01:09:20.832
No, something bothering you?

01:09:20.908 --> 01:09:22.773
Yes. I don't like being watched

01:09:22.843 --> 01:09:24.332
or stared at, for that matter.

01:10:19.433 --> 01:10:21.560
Detective Buzz Larabee.

01:10:23.837 --> 01:10:26.362
I need you to identify a body.

01:10:30.110 --> 01:10:31.600
So...

01:10:31.678 --> 01:10:33.441
how well'd you know him?

01:10:33.513 --> 01:10:36.243
I worked part-time at his bar,
the Chelsea.

01:10:36.316 --> 01:10:39.342
And when did you see him last?

01:10:39.419 --> 01:10:40.750
Tuesday night.

01:10:40.821 --> 01:10:43.051
- This was at the bar?
- Yes.

01:10:44.324 --> 01:10:46.451
So, what did you talk about?

01:10:46.526 --> 01:10:47.993
We didn't talk much.

01:10:48.061 --> 01:10:49.926
When I got off work that night,

01:10:49.997 --> 01:10:52.557
Mort escorted me to my car
in the parking lot.

01:10:52.632 --> 01:10:55.897
He was like that... polite,
always looking out for me.

01:10:55.969 --> 01:10:59.302
He told me to take care and...

01:10:59.373 --> 01:11:02.365
gave me a few days off
to bring my aunt up here to Vegas.

01:11:03.977 --> 01:11:06.377
- Anything else?
- Yes.

01:11:10.484 --> 01:11:12.418
A man called Bonoeffer.

01:11:19.159 --> 01:11:21.150
Freaky, the whole
day had been like that.

01:11:21.228 --> 01:11:22.217
How?

01:11:22.295 --> 01:11:25.890
I'd seen this man earlier on TV,
Felix Bonoeffer...

01:11:25.966 --> 01:11:27.831
- Who?
- Felix Bonoeffer.

01:11:27.901 --> 01:11:29.425
That's what he called himself.

01:11:29.503 --> 01:11:31.801
- I don't think it was his real name.
- Why not?

01:11:31.872 --> 01:11:33.669
He was involved in a shootout.

01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:35.298
Now, involved in a shootout?

01:11:35.375 --> 01:11:36.808
What do you mean?

01:11:36.877 --> 01:11:39.812
He was with my friend Tracy
in his car when it happened.

01:11:39.913 --> 01:11:42.438
Well, what's this
got to do with Mort?

01:11:42.516 --> 01:11:43.540
Who?

01:11:44.684 --> 01:11:46.584
The guy on the slab, lady,

01:11:46.653 --> 01:11:48.177
your friend in the freezer.

01:11:53.693 --> 01:11:54.990
Are you okay?

01:11:55.062 --> 01:11:57.360
No. Can I sit down?

01:11:57.431 --> 01:11:58.921
Let me get you some water.

01:11:58.999 --> 01:12:00.626
Tiddles!

01:12:10.343 --> 01:12:11.503
Hi, Shelley.

01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:15.776
Where's the kitchen?
I gotta get this lady some water.

01:12:15.849 --> 01:12:17.146
It's through there.

01:12:18.151 --> 01:12:19.277
Are these two okay?

01:12:19.352 --> 01:12:21.786
- They're channeling.
- All right.

01:12:41.341 --> 01:12:42.365
There you go.

01:12:42.442 --> 01:12:43.670
Thanks.

01:12:47.881 --> 01:12:49.007
What happened next?

01:12:49.082 --> 01:12:51.050
He calmed down
after a few minutes,

01:12:51.118 --> 01:12:54.281
so Mort asked if it was okay
to leave us together.

01:12:54.354 --> 01:12:56.345
You know, was it safe.

01:12:56.423 --> 01:12:57.890
He said he had to go.

01:12:57.958 --> 01:12:59.983
Okay. Then what?

01:13:00.060 --> 01:13:04.588
He got into his car and started
to drive out of the parking lot.

01:13:04.664 --> 01:13:07.258
"...he started to..."

01:13:07.334 --> 01:13:10.326
He got into his car
and started to drive...

01:13:10.403 --> 01:13:13.930
"...of the parking lot...

01:13:14.007 --> 01:13:16.669
and then..."

01:13:22.883 --> 01:13:24.248
<i>Dinner's ready.</i>

01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:28.610
Dinner's ready.

01:13:28.688 --> 01:13:30.815
Okay. I'll be there in a moment.

01:13:30.891 --> 01:13:32.153
How's it going?

01:13:34.461 --> 01:13:35.792
I don't know. It's a...

01:13:35.862 --> 01:13:37.352
little strange.

01:13:37.464 --> 01:13:39.022
Like you.

01:13:44.538 --> 01:13:46.199
Hi, Stormy.

01:13:46.273 --> 01:13:47.797
<i>Hello.</i>

01:13:47.874 --> 01:13:50.240
Do you want to read
what I've just written?

01:13:50.310 --> 01:13:52.870
No. Later, love.
Come on, dinner's ready.

01:13:52.946 --> 01:13:55.107
- Come on.
- I will, I'll be there.

01:14:11.798 --> 01:14:13.390
That was nice, thank you.

01:14:13.466 --> 01:14:16.299
Eat your salad, it's good for you.
It's organic.

01:14:16.369 --> 01:14:18.269
I hate salad.

01:14:18.338 --> 01:14:21.398
<i>- Bunny food.
- The actor died.</i>

01:14:21.474 --> 01:14:24.409
<i>You know, he was falling all over
the place, he was perspiring,</i>

01:14:24.477 --> 01:14:26.911
<i>and I don't know,
his gun fell from his hand...</i>

01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:28.971
<i>And then the next thing,
he collapsed.</i>

01:14:29.049 --> 01:14:32.143
<i>He collapsed, and so that was...
I don't know, that was it.</i>

01:14:32.219 --> 01:14:33.584
<i>You know, the actor died.</i>

01:14:33.653 --> 01:14:36.918
<i>We were left high and dry, literally.</i>

01:14:36.990 --> 01:14:39.015
<i>- Wow.
- Yeah, wow.</i>

01:14:39.092 --> 01:14:41.959
<i>But the spooky thing was...</i>

01:14:42.028 --> 01:14:43.655
<i>What?</i>

01:14:43.730 --> 01:14:46.290
<i>Well, I don't know how
to describe it. It's like...</i>

01:14:46.366 --> 01:14:49.199
<i>it's like we have no control
over anything.</i>

01:14:49.269 --> 01:14:52.568
<i>It's like we're being
pushed about by something.</i>

01:14:52.639 --> 01:14:54.504
<i>Everybody on the set felt it.</i>

01:14:54.574 --> 01:14:56.474
<i>It was like a big joke.</i>

01:14:56.543 --> 01:14:57.635
<i>A joke?</i>

01:14:57.711 --> 01:15:00.271
<i>- Yeah, a joke.
- It was really strange.</i>

01:15:00.347 --> 01:15:02.907
<i>- How?
- Well, the guy who wrote it...</i>

01:15:02.983 --> 01:15:05.850
<i>- He did it for a laugh.
- That's what we heard, anyway.</i>

01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:07.978
<i>Who wrote it, Gavin?</i>

01:15:09.022 --> 01:15:11.149
<i>- I don't know.
- Nobody knows, really.</i>

01:15:11.224 --> 01:15:14.660
<i>Nobody knows who he is
or where he came from.</i>

01:15:15.662 --> 01:15:17.289
<i>It's kinda scary.</i>

01:15:17.364 --> 01:15:18.831
How do you mean, scary?

01:15:18.898 --> 01:15:20.889
Like when you're a little kid...

01:15:21.735 --> 01:15:22.997
and it's dark...

01:15:24.704 --> 01:15:27.172
you keep thinking that you see
somebody you don't know

01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:28.867
looking at you through a window.

01:15:28.942 --> 01:15:30.637
It's kinda like a dream.

01:15:37.884 --> 01:15:39.215
Oh, shit!

01:15:39.286 --> 01:15:41.083
Can't you control your pages?!

01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:14.552
Oh, my God.

01:16:55.295 --> 01:16:57.229
<i>Where the hell is he?</i>

01:17:03.536 --> 01:17:04.434
<i>Felix!</i>

01:17:06.072 --> 01:17:07.937
<i>Hey, Felix! Felix!</i>

01:17:09.809 --> 01:17:11.276
<i>So?</i>

01:17:12.779 --> 01:17:13.803
What?

01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:16.371
<i>What happens next, man?</i>

01:17:16.449 --> 01:17:18.417
Search me.
I don't have a clue.

01:17:21.955 --> 01:17:24.549
<i>You schmuck. Schmucko!</i>

01:17:26.326 --> 01:17:27.452
You talking to me?

01:17:27.527 --> 01:17:30.121
<i>Who in the hell do you think
I'm talking to?</i>

01:17:30.196 --> 01:17:32.130
Leave me alone.
Give me a break, will you?

01:17:32.198 --> 01:17:33.927
<i>You just killed Barbara.</i>

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:37.128
<i>- Who?
- My script supervisor, dummy!</i>

01:17:37.203 --> 01:17:38.636
<i>- So what?
- She's the one person</i>

01:17:38.705 --> 01:17:40.935
<i>who's been holding
this thing together.</i>

01:17:41.007 --> 01:17:43.441
<i>There's a lot of people
with their dicks flapping in the breeze,</i>

01:17:43.510 --> 01:17:44.909
<i>and they're pissed off at you, man!</i>

01:17:44.978 --> 01:17:47.708
<i>What... what... what's...
what's going on around here?</i>

01:17:48.715 --> 01:17:51.741
<i>I don't know this place.
I don't know this place.</i>

01:17:51.818 --> 01:17:54.378
<i>Garvin, baby!</i>

01:17:57.223 --> 01:17:59.885
<i>- Where am I?
- We're inside Bonoeffer's computer.</i>

01:17:59.959 --> 01:18:01.119
<i>Like viruses.</i>

01:18:01.194 --> 01:18:02.456
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

01:18:02.529 --> 01:18:04.793
<i>We're inside his hard drive, man.
Think about it.</i>

01:18:04.864 --> 01:18:06.126
<i>You are nuts.</i>

01:18:06.199 --> 01:18:08.292
<i>Okay, so I'm nuts,
but look in the corner.</i>

01:18:08.368 --> 01:18:10.768
<i>Do you see?
That's Felix sleeping in that chair.</i>

01:18:10.837 --> 01:18:12.930
<i>- Who's Felix?
- He's the writer.</i>

01:18:14.741 --> 01:18:17.574
<i>I eat writers for breakfast.</i>

01:18:17.644 --> 01:18:20.374
<i>Listen, I can't talk right now.
I'm in somebody's hard drive.</i>

01:18:20.447 --> 01:18:22.972
<i>Did somebody say Felix Bonoeffer?</i>

01:18:23.049 --> 01:18:26.041
<i>- Well, who the hell are you?
- Buzz Larabee, detective.</i>

01:18:26.119 --> 01:18:28.610
<i>I've gotta question
this Bonoeffer guy, whoever he is,</i>

01:18:28.688 --> 01:18:30.747
<i>and what do you two
know about him, anyway?</i>

01:18:30.824 --> 01:18:32.348
<i>He's a writer.
What's there to know?</i>

01:18:32.425 --> 01:18:34.723
<i>He was involved
in a shootout on the freeway.</i>

01:18:35.562 --> 01:18:37.189
<i>- A shootout?
- A shootout.</i>

01:18:37.263 --> 01:18:40.255
<i>I knew it! I knew it! I knew it!</i>

01:18:40.333 --> 01:18:45.293
<i>Yeah, I knew there was something
about that guy with the stupid accent.</i>

01:18:45.371 --> 01:18:46.929
<i>Where can I find him?</i>

01:18:47.006 --> 01:18:49.270
<i>Look in there, over there to the left.</i>

01:18:49.342 --> 01:18:52.436
<i>See him sleeping in the chair?
That's him. There he is.</i>

01:18:52.512 --> 01:18:55.208
<i>So that's him.
How can I get to him?</i>

01:18:55.281 --> 01:18:57.374
<i>- No, don't disturb him.
- Why the hell not?</i>

01:18:57.450 --> 01:19:00.010
<i>- Because he owes me, that's why.
- What do you mean?</i>

01:19:00.086 --> 01:19:02.247
<i>A conclusion.
He keeps killing people off.</i>

01:19:02.322 --> 01:19:03.619
<i>Tell me about it, huh?</i>

01:19:03.690 --> 01:19:06.124
<i>Especially when he's tired.
He needs to sleep.</i>

01:19:06.192 --> 01:19:09.423
<i>He's extremely dangerous,
especially when he's tired.</i>

01:19:09.496 --> 01:19:12.761
<i>That's why I have to lock
this creep up... he's dangerous.</i>

01:19:12.832 --> 01:19:17.860
<i>I hate writers. I always have.
Did he write this garbage?</i>

01:19:17.937 --> 01:19:20.235
Would you mind
taking out the garbage?

01:19:20.306 --> 01:19:21.568
<i>- Who's that?
- Who is that?</i>

01:19:21.641 --> 01:19:23.233
<i>- His wife.
- Wife?</i>

01:19:23.309 --> 01:19:25.106
<i>His wife.</i>

01:19:25.178 --> 01:19:26.372
<i>I know that voice.</i>

01:19:26.446 --> 01:19:28.107
Love, the garbage?

01:19:28.181 --> 01:19:30.308
<i>Gina, don't wake him, Gina.</i>

01:19:30.383 --> 01:19:32.442
<i>Gina, please don't wake him.</i>

01:19:32.519 --> 01:19:33.543
Love?

01:19:47.467 --> 01:19:50.459
Love, can you please
take out the trash?

01:19:50.537 --> 01:19:52.061
What? Sorry.

01:19:52.138 --> 01:19:55.130
Can you please take out
the kitchen trash before you go to sleep?

01:19:55.208 --> 01:19:56.800
I don't want it to smell up the house.

01:19:56.876 --> 01:19:58.138
Okay. Hi, Stormy.

01:19:59.245 --> 01:20:00.872
- Come on, love.
- All right.

01:20:13.159 --> 01:20:14.183
God Almighty.

01:20:14.260 --> 01:20:15.955
Why'd you kill me off like that?

01:20:16.029 --> 01:20:17.291
What?

01:20:17.363 --> 01:20:19.422
Why'd you kill me off like that?

01:20:19.499 --> 01:20:21.330
I didn't kill you off.
What are you talking about?

01:20:21.401 --> 01:20:25.132
Shit, man, you killed me in scene 23.
I got the script right here.

01:20:25.204 --> 01:20:26.728
Keep your voice down.

01:20:27.907 --> 01:20:29.397
There, see?

01:20:29.475 --> 01:20:31.909
I was supposed to go to scene 32.

01:20:33.112 --> 01:20:34.101
You were?

01:20:34.180 --> 01:20:36.410
Yeah, man, my part
was a lot bigger than this.

01:20:36.482 --> 01:20:38.347
I had three more scenes.

01:20:38.418 --> 01:20:39.908
Oh, I don't remember that.

01:20:41.187 --> 01:20:42.518
Look at scene 32.

01:20:43.690 --> 01:20:45.988
That was supposed to be me.

01:20:46.059 --> 01:20:47.651
I was supposed to come in and yell...

01:20:47.727 --> 01:20:49.319
Stop doing this!

01:20:50.797 --> 01:20:52.890
So they didn't shoot it
the way I wrote it?

01:20:52.966 --> 01:20:55.764
Man, Matt Dobbs
was rewriting everything.

01:20:55.835 --> 01:20:58.565
He was all over the place...
all over the director, everyone.

01:20:58.638 --> 01:21:00.503
- Who was the director?
- Gavin.

01:21:00.573 --> 01:21:02.837
Gavin, yeah, I remember.
He was very good.

01:21:02.909 --> 01:21:04.376
He was a pussy on this thing.

01:21:04.444 --> 01:21:06.469
Nice guy, but he had no control.

01:21:06.546 --> 01:21:09.242
Matt Dobbs was directing
the fucking movie.

01:21:09.315 --> 01:21:12.307
He was? Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know that, Mort.

01:21:12.385 --> 01:21:15.912
My name's not Mort, it's Phil.

01:21:15.989 --> 01:21:17.479
Phil Henderson?

01:21:17.557 --> 01:21:19.650
Phil, I'm sorry, Phil. I didn't...

01:21:19.726 --> 01:21:21.591
So, who's Mort?

01:21:22.795 --> 01:21:24.888
Mort is the character
I was playing, man.

01:21:24.964 --> 01:21:26.898
What's wrong with you?

01:21:26.966 --> 01:21:29.332
Oh, the hole in the head.

01:21:31.004 --> 01:21:33.905
So, this guy was directing everything?

01:21:33.973 --> 01:21:35.235
Everything, man.

01:21:35.308 --> 01:21:37.003
He had us doing line readings.

01:21:37.076 --> 01:21:40.170
He kept saying he knew
Pacino and Scorsese.

01:21:40.246 --> 01:21:41.736
Big fucking deal.

01:21:41.814 --> 01:21:43.543
He kept saying things like,

01:21:43.616 --> 01:21:46.016
"I was out last night,
and I was talking to Bobby,

01:21:46.085 --> 01:21:47.609
- "and Marlon was there..."
- Hey, Leo!

01:21:47.687 --> 01:21:49.917
"...and Marlon said this,
and Bobby said that,

01:21:49.989 --> 01:21:52.116
and Al, you know he loved improv."

01:21:52.191 --> 01:21:53.590
- All that crap.
- Actors.

01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:55.753
Maybe that's why the jerk-off died.

01:21:55.828 --> 01:21:59.025
He had to have total control,
you know what I mean?

01:21:59.098 --> 01:22:03.262
A power freak.
Even Gavin went nuts at one point.

01:22:03.336 --> 01:22:06.931
<i>You remember that speech about
The Invasion of the Body Snatchers?</i>

01:22:07.006 --> 01:22:08.303
Body snatchers? No.

01:22:08.374 --> 01:22:11.036
- You didn't write that?
- No, I didn't write it.

01:22:11.110 --> 01:22:14.477
I knew it. I knew it.
This guy was a piece of work.

01:22:14.547 --> 01:22:18.278
He just took off on this speech
about body snatchers in a movie.

01:22:18.351 --> 01:22:19.545
Don't you see the dailies?

01:22:19.619 --> 01:22:21.610
No, I'm not allowed
near the set, that's why.

01:22:21.688 --> 01:22:24.122
Well, you wrote the movie,
and it was a good script.

01:22:24.190 --> 01:22:25.214
It was very good.

01:22:25.291 --> 01:22:27.691
In fact, that's the only reason
I took the movie.

01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:29.227
It was a big break for me.

01:22:29.295 --> 01:22:30.956
So, someone died?

01:22:32.465 --> 01:22:34.433
Yeah, Matt Dobbs.

01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:37.936
You wrote the part of Ray
for an African-American, right?

01:22:38.004 --> 01:22:39.062
I did?

01:22:39.138 --> 01:22:41.800
Yeah, man, what's wrong with you?
Are you on drugs?

01:22:41.874 --> 01:22:43.171
No, no, I'm not on drugs.

01:22:43.242 --> 01:22:46.769
Ray, the character that Matt Dobbs
was playing, was black.

01:22:46.846 --> 01:22:49.110
Matt Dobbs
wasn't a black actor, man,

01:22:49.182 --> 01:22:51.309
he was white, like her.

01:22:53.019 --> 01:22:54.145
Oh, my God.

01:22:54.220 --> 01:22:56.450
Why did you kill me off, Felix?

01:22:56.522 --> 01:22:59.980
- Barbara.
- I was just the script supervisor.

01:23:00.059 --> 01:23:01.526
That's all I was.

01:23:01.594 --> 01:23:02.788
It's Barbara.

01:23:02.862 --> 01:23:04.625
Now you have no continuity.

01:23:06.499 --> 01:23:08.490
Nothing makes sense anymore.

01:23:10.870 --> 01:23:12.337
It's so unfair.

01:23:13.406 --> 01:23:16.170
It's just so unfair.

01:23:19.846 --> 01:23:22.178
So unfair.

01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:24.842
<i>Go.</i>

01:23:26.486 --> 01:23:28.420
Mommy.

01:23:31.424 --> 01:23:32.823
Oh, my God.

01:23:32.892 --> 01:23:35.986
Let's get a doctor, an ambulance.

01:23:36.062 --> 01:23:37.051
Oh, God.

01:23:42.535 --> 01:23:45.231
It's okay, man. It's okay.

01:23:45.304 --> 01:23:47.772
Yeah, they gave him
a thorough checkup.

01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:51.708
Bloodwork was fine,
and the heart is great.

01:23:51.778 --> 01:23:54.941
They even gave him
a brain scan, but he's fine.

01:23:55.882 --> 01:23:59.010
What happened was
I went into the den...

01:23:59.085 --> 01:24:02.987
Love, can you take out the trash
before you lock up, please?

01:24:03.055 --> 01:24:04.647
The kitchen trash.

01:24:04.724 --> 01:24:07.784
Love, can you please take out
the trash before you lock up?

01:24:07.860 --> 01:24:08.849
Are you okay?

01:24:10.730 --> 01:24:11.924
I can't move.

01:24:11.998 --> 01:24:14.865
I couldn't wake him up.
He said he couldn't move,

01:24:14.934 --> 01:24:16.765
so I just called the ambulance,

01:24:16.836 --> 01:24:18.531
and we got him to the hospital.

01:24:18.604 --> 01:24:20.094
I guess he's just stressed out.

01:24:20.173 --> 01:24:23.267
He's been working so late
on this project of his, but he's fine.

01:24:23.342 --> 01:24:24.570
I'll see you at the hospital.

01:24:26.646 --> 01:24:28.170
No escape.

01:25:01.214 --> 01:25:02.909
<i>We got him to emergency,</i>

01:25:02.982 --> 01:25:05.246
<i>but couldn't find
anything wrong with him.</i>

01:25:05.318 --> 01:25:06.876
<i>He's right as rain.</i>

01:25:06.953 --> 01:25:08.215
<i>Terrible pain.</i>

01:25:09.488 --> 01:25:11.479
<i>So, when they gonna
let you go, honey?</i>

01:25:11.557 --> 01:25:13.889
<i>Maybe Tuesday.</i>

01:25:13.960 --> 01:25:17.555
<i>Maybe not today, maybe tomorrow.</i>

01:25:17.630 --> 01:25:18.995
<i>Life.</i>

01:25:35.948 --> 01:25:37.279
<i>Hi, Felix.</i>

01:25:48.327 --> 01:25:49.658
<i>Felix.</i>

01:26:11.284 --> 01:26:12.512
Hi.

01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:20.753
I'm Dr. Geekman, and this is
my associate, Dr. Stuart Cohen.

01:26:20.826 --> 01:26:22.293
So, you're ready to go home?

01:26:23.562 --> 01:26:26.725
The good news is we can find nothing
physically, organically wrong.

01:26:26.799 --> 01:26:30.200
- Absolutely nothing.
- It could be just stress, right, Stu?

01:26:30.269 --> 01:26:32.897
Right, stress, anxiety, perhaps.

01:26:32.972 --> 01:26:34.564
Has he been under stress?

01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:36.631
I'm sorry, you're his wife?

01:26:36.709 --> 01:26:38.540
- Gina, hello.
- Hi, Gina.

01:26:38.611 --> 01:26:40.374
Has he been under stress,
under pressure?

01:26:40.446 --> 01:26:42.175
He's been writing a screenplay.

01:26:42.248 --> 01:26:46.048
He's a bit obsessive about it,
stays up most nights writing,

01:26:46.118 --> 01:26:48.746
but other than that
he's actually okay, Doctor.

01:26:48.821 --> 01:26:52.348
- You're an all-or-nothing kind of guy?
- Yes, he is.

01:26:52.425 --> 01:26:54.586
Lots of people
around this town like that.

01:26:54.660 --> 01:26:56.753
Need to relax, let go.

01:26:56.829 --> 01:26:58.888
Yeah, let go.
Can I talk to you for a sec?

01:26:59.999 --> 01:27:03.730
Has your husband ever been diagnosed
as suffering from bipolar disorder?

01:27:03.803 --> 01:27:06.499
He just thinks he's losing his mind.

01:27:06.572 --> 01:27:10.406
He thinks he's going crazy, Doctor.

01:27:11.477 --> 01:27:14.469
<i>- Hello.
- Is there anything you can do?</i>

01:27:14.547 --> 01:27:16.947
Well, like Stu said, just complete rest.

01:27:17.016 --> 01:27:18.176
Yes, complete rest.

01:27:18.250 --> 01:27:20.218
Lots of sleep and easy does it.

01:27:20.286 --> 01:27:23.881
Moderation in all things.
You know, the golden rule.

01:27:30.129 --> 01:27:31.426
<i>You're next!</i>

01:27:32.498 --> 01:27:35.228
Okay, well, no physical activity
for a few days,

01:27:35.301 --> 01:27:38.236
and complete rest,
lot of sleep, you know?

01:27:39.472 --> 01:27:41.201
We could try some medication.

01:27:41.273 --> 01:27:44.037
- Oh, no, Doctor, no drugs.
- Does he smoke?

01:27:44.110 --> 01:27:46.203
- No.
- Alcohol?

01:27:46.278 --> 01:27:48.007
No.

01:27:49.582 --> 01:27:51.345
Be good to yourself. Relax.

01:27:51.417 --> 01:27:52.611
Thank you.

01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:55.909
Hello?

01:27:55.988 --> 01:27:57.751
Thank you, Doctor.

01:28:45.204 --> 01:28:47.195
Are you okay?

01:28:48.407 --> 01:28:49.567
Yeah.

01:28:50.676 --> 01:28:52.303
Are you sure?

01:29:01.454 --> 01:29:02.648
Hello, Felix.

01:29:08.127 --> 01:29:09.617
What are you doing?

01:29:09.695 --> 01:29:11.162
I've gotta get out.

01:29:11.230 --> 01:29:13.721
- I've gotta get out of here.
- What are you doing?

01:29:17.770 --> 01:29:19.135
God!

01:29:20.906 --> 01:29:22.237
Don't!

01:29:22.308 --> 01:29:23.502
Please stop.

01:29:23.576 --> 01:29:25.544
Love. Love!

01:29:25.611 --> 01:29:26.669
I've got to get back.

01:29:26.745 --> 01:29:29.578
It's 4:00.
It's 4:00, my time's up.

01:29:29.648 --> 01:29:31.343
My time's up. I've gotta go back.

01:29:31.417 --> 01:29:33.647
- Please don't be crazy.
- My time's up.

01:29:33.719 --> 01:29:34.879
Hold it.

01:29:34.954 --> 01:29:36.581
I've gotta get back.

01:29:36.655 --> 01:29:37.644
We're almost home.

01:29:37.723 --> 01:29:39.554
- I'm here to help.
- Please don't hurt him!

01:29:39.625 --> 01:29:42.753
We're not gonna hurt him.
Is he on some kind of medication?

01:29:42.828 --> 01:29:45.558
No, he's just been released
from the hospital, officer.

01:29:45.631 --> 01:29:47.394
Okay, so he's not
on anything right now?

01:29:47.466 --> 01:29:48.990
No, he's just been under
a lot of stress.

01:29:49.068 --> 01:29:50.626
Morning View Highway.

01:29:50.703 --> 01:29:53.365
All right, take it easy.
Just breathe. Just breathe.

01:29:53.439 --> 01:29:55.373
Hey! Wait, wait!

01:30:30.176 --> 01:30:32.474
What's that, dear?

01:30:32.545 --> 01:30:34.479
Oh, yes, I heard.

01:30:34.547 --> 01:30:35.878
I heard.

01:30:35.948 --> 01:30:38.246
Poor old Felix.

01:30:43.222 --> 01:30:46.658
Cut. That's lunch, everyone.

01:30:46.725 --> 01:30:47.714
That's it.

01:31:35.774 --> 01:31:37.503
You're pulling my chest hairs!

01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:43.300
You're next.

01:33:47.873 --> 01:33:49.306
Go, go, go.

01:36:01.306 --> 01:36:03.240
- Hi.
- Hello.

01:36:03.308 --> 01:36:05.173
So, you're ready to go home?
