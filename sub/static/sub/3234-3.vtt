05:06.430 --> 05:07.830
He's still breathing.

05:09.233 --> 05:12.301
By the looks of him,
he has no idea how close he came.

05:13.803 --> 05:16.437
I'm assuming Saul Goodman
doesn't need to know.

05:18.274 --> 05:19.640
Mum's the word.

05:38.758 --> 05:40.825
<i>* Old MacDonald had a farm *</i>

05:40.859 --> 05:42.593
<i>* E-I-E-I-O * </i>

05:42.627 --> 05:45.029
* And on his farm he had a duck *

05:45.063 --> 05:46.697

05:46.731 --> 05:47.964

05:50.301 --> 05:51.367

06:16.619 --> 06:17.818
Hang on, baby.

06:30.427 --> 06:31.427
<i>Hello.</i>

06:32.428 --> 06:34.162
Walt, are you in the house?

06:36.532 --> 06:38.633
<i>Oh, hey, Skyler.</i>

06:38.667 --> 06:39.668
<i>Yeah, it's me.</i>

06:41.506 --> 06:44.076
What-- What the hell
are you doing in there?

06:44.110 --> 06:45.945
<i>I'm back.</i>

06:45.980 --> 06:48.281
No. No, you're not back.

06:48.316 --> 06:49.649
Walt, you're not back.

06:49.683 --> 06:51.450
Get-- Get-- Get out of there.

06:51.484 --> 06:54.018
<i>Well, it's-- it's my house,
too, Skyler.</i>

06:54.053 --> 06:55.886
<i>I'm staying. End of story.</i>

06:57.255 --> 06:58.255
We had an agreement.

06:58.289 --> 07:01.257
<i>I didn't agree to anything.</i>

07:01.291 --> 07:02.624
Now, look, just come on inside,

07:02.658 --> 07:04.058
and we'll talk this through, okay?

07:04.093 --> 07:07.260
No. No. There's
nothing to talk about.

07:07.295 --> 07:10.829
I am not coming in there
until you get out.

07:12.631 --> 07:14.398
Well...

07:14.432 --> 07:15.532
suit yourself.

07:16.700 --> 07:19.768
Walt. Walt?

07:44.285 --> 07:46.952
What is wrong with you?

07:46.987 --> 07:50.089
Skyler, I have every
right to be here.

07:50.123 --> 07:51.457
No, you don't.

07:51.492 --> 07:53.559
You don't live here anymore.

07:53.594 --> 07:54.994
We're getting a divorce.

07:55.028 --> 07:56.629
I don't agree to a divorce.

07:56.663 --> 07:57.930
It's not up to you.

08:00.133 --> 08:02.836
If you don't get out
of here right now,

08:02.870 --> 08:04.507
I'm going to call the police

08:04.541 --> 08:08.078
and I'm going to
tell them everything.

08:08.113 --> 08:10.947
I mean it, Walt.

08:13.952 --> 08:15.452
There's the phone.

08:34.172 --> 08:37.140
<i>It's ringing.</i>

08:37.174 --> 08:39.611
<i>Albuquerque Police Department,</i>

08:39.645 --> 08:41.580
<i>Operator #314B.</i>

08:41.615 --> 08:43.683
<i>How may I help you?</i>

08:51.358 --> 08:54.894
Yes, I-- I want to report
a disturbance, please.

08:56.863 --> 08:59.264
No, no, it's not-
it's not exactly--

08:59.299 --> 09:00.299
It's, um...

09:02.068 --> 09:03.868
It's a domestic issue.

09:05.404 --> 09:06.404
Okay.

09:10.543 --> 09:12.110
They're connecting me.

09:14.080 --> 09:16.915
Right hand to God,
I will tell them.

09:16.949 --> 09:19.350
Do what you have to do, Skyler.

09:20.519 --> 09:24.187
This family is everything to me.

09:24.221 --> 09:27.757
Without it, I have nothing to lose.

09:27.791 --> 09:28.791
Fine.

09:31.828 --> 09:34.296
Yes, my name is Skyler White.

09:34.330 --> 09:37.231
I need police assistance
at my home right away.

09:37.266 --> 09:38.532
My--

09:39.567 --> 09:41.668
soon-to-be ex-husband

09:41.703 --> 09:43.270
broke into my house,

09:43.304 --> 09:45.104
and I need an officer

09:45.139 --> 09:46.906
to come and remove him.

09:48.375 --> 09:51.911
It's 308 Negra Arroyo Lane.

09:53.346 --> 09:54.346
Okay.

09:55.549 --> 09:56.549
Okay.

09:58.386 --> 10:00.019
Thank you.

10:06.593 --> 10:07.626
They're coming.

10:57.452 --> 10:58.719
Oh... Dad's here?

10:58.753 --> 11:00.253
Hey. Dad.

11:00.288 --> 11:01.521
Hey, son, come here.

11:01.555 --> 11:04.324
How are you?

11:04.358 --> 11:07.093
Are-- Are you back for good?

11:07.127 --> 11:09.461
Why-- Why are you home so soon?

11:09.495 --> 11:10.896
I-- I'm not.

11:12.031 --> 11:13.298
Ah.

11:13.332 --> 11:15.800
Hey, I am starving.
How about a grilled cheese?

11:15.834 --> 11:17.334
Yeah, sure. You want one, too?

11:17.368 --> 11:20.170
Walter, your dad and I have
something we need to discuss.

11:20.204 --> 11:22.172
When your sandwich is ready,

11:22.206 --> 11:24.407
I'll bring it to your-
to your room.

11:24.441 --> 11:26.675
Mom, can't it wait?

11:26.709 --> 11:29.311
I haven't seen Dad in,
like, forever.

11:29.345 --> 11:30.745
Walter--

11:37.352 --> 11:38.719
Ooh.

11:41.422 --> 11:43.657
Mmm.

11:43.691 --> 11:44.924
Mmm.

11:46.560 --> 11:48.961
So are you gonna be
at work tomorrow?

11:48.995 --> 11:51.429
Yeah, that's the plan.

12:05.776 --> 12:07.977
Hello, ma'am. We were
called about a disturbance?

12:08.011 --> 12:11.413
It's more of a trespassing
situation, really, but--

12:13.349 --> 12:15.016
Yeah, that was me.

12:15.050 --> 12:19.620
You called the cops on Dad?

12:23.091 --> 12:25.525
I, uh-- I came home from work,

12:25.559 --> 12:26.759
and he was back.

12:26.794 --> 12:29.295
He just moved back into the house.

12:29.329 --> 12:33.731
And I asked him to leave,
but he won't listen.

12:33.765 --> 12:34.831
I just--

12:36.000 --> 12:37.834
I-- I want him out.

12:37.868 --> 12:39.902
I want him out of the house.

12:39.937 --> 12:42.070
Okay, Mrs. White.
There's a couple of questions

12:42.105 --> 12:43.671
I need to ask you
right off of the bat.

12:43.706 --> 12:45.306
It's very important that
you answer them honestly.

12:45.340 --> 12:47.207
Did he strike you?

12:47.241 --> 12:48.574
No.

12:48.609 --> 12:50.176
Has he ever hit you?

12:50.210 --> 12:52.944
No. This is not about violence.

12:52.978 --> 12:55.045
This is about trespassing,

12:55.080 --> 12:58.848
about him being here
against my will.

12:58.882 --> 13:00.082
Okay. Trespassing.

13:00.116 --> 13:01.716
You're divorced, then?

13:01.751 --> 13:03.951
No, working on it.

13:03.985 --> 13:05.719
Right now we're separated.

13:05.753 --> 13:08.187
Legally separated?

13:08.221 --> 13:09.487
Well, there's not a court order,

13:09.522 --> 13:10.722
if that's what you mean,

13:10.756 --> 13:12.056
but we've been living apart

13:12.090 --> 13:14.324
for almost two weeks,
give or take--

13:14.359 --> 13:16.026
I changed the locks.

13:16.060 --> 13:18.761
Isn't that breaking and entering?

13:18.795 --> 13:20.863
Whose name is on the
title to the house?

13:20.897 --> 13:23.365
Both of us. It's jointly owned.

13:23.400 --> 13:24.500
We can't arrest a man

13:24.534 --> 13:26.234
for breaking into his own house,

13:26.269 --> 13:27.435
not without a court order

13:27.470 --> 13:29.037
requiring he stays
away from the premises,

13:29.071 --> 13:31.438
unless he's threatened you
or the kids in any way.

13:31.473 --> 13:33.607
No, not--

13:33.641 --> 13:35.075
not physically, but having him

13:35.109 --> 13:36.476
in the house is just--

13:37.778 --> 13:40.213
It's not a good thing.

13:40.247 --> 13:43.749
Excuse me. Don't cry. Daddy's here.

13:43.783 --> 13:45.284
I got her, honey.

13:45.318 --> 13:47.018
Oh, come here.

13:47.053 --> 13:49.020
There we go.

13:49.054 --> 13:50.854
You hungry?

13:50.888 --> 13:52.788
You hungry?

13:52.823 --> 13:53.789
Here we go.

13:53.823 --> 13:56.390
Oh, that was it.

13:56.424 --> 13:59.659
I'm sorry, Officer. Where were we?

13:59.693 --> 14:01.060
Disagreements.

14:01.094 --> 14:04.862
Yeah, so we've had
our share of that.

14:04.897 --> 14:07.965
Um, I-- I haven't...

14:07.999 --> 14:10.433
I haven't been the most
attentive husband lately.

14:12.902 --> 14:16.570
Mrs. White, would this be easier
if we stepped outside for a minute?

14:20.207 --> 14:21.407
No.

14:22.676 --> 14:23.676
No.

14:25.112 --> 14:27.079
I'm fine right here.

14:27.114 --> 14:28.782
I'm gonna level with you, ma'am.

14:28.816 --> 14:30.317
If you want your husband
out of the house,

14:30.351 --> 14:32.219
you're gonna have to help me out.

14:32.253 --> 14:35.324
Is it possible maybe he's broken
any laws that you know of?

14:35.358 --> 14:37.428
Anything at all.

14:37.462 --> 14:39.832
Anything that we can work
with here, just tell me.

14:39.866 --> 14:42.168
Even if you've just got a
suspicion of wrongdoing,

14:42.203 --> 14:43.404
I can work with that.

14:43.438 --> 14:45.406
I'll get him out of
the house for you.

14:45.441 --> 14:47.376
What's your take on all this?

14:47.411 --> 14:50.281
It-- It's my mom's fault.

14:50.315 --> 14:51.416
I--

14:54.555 --> 14:57.991
and it's because he
didn't do anything.

14:58.025 --> 15:00.660
I don't know whyshe's b.

15:00.694 --> 15:02.861
My-- My dad--

15:02.896 --> 15:05.964
...he is a great guy.

15:10.335 --> 15:11.635
Mrs. White?

15:15.106 --> 15:16.473
I'm sorry, ma'am.

15:16.507 --> 15:18.441
There's no legal basis

15:18.475 --> 15:20.310
for us to remove your
husband from the house.

15:21.845 --> 15:24.480
Next time you feel like things
are getting out of control,

15:24.514 --> 15:25.981
you should call this number.

15:26.015 --> 15:27.849
It's the family hotline.

15:27.884 --> 15:30.251
I'd really look into
some counseling.

15:32.754 --> 15:34.288
Best of luck to you folks.

15:34.322 --> 15:37.157
Listen, thank you, officers.
We're sorry.

15:44.997 --> 15:46.364
Why do you got to--

15:46.398 --> 15:48.166
Why do you got to do this to Dad?

15:48.200 --> 15:49.433
Junior. Wait. Come on.

15:49.468 --> 15:51.402
Don't blame your mother for this.

15:56.406 --> 15:57.507
Sorry.

16:04.247 --> 16:07.315
Ah, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

16:15.222 --> 16:16.622
Welcome home.

16:59.294 --> 17:00.727
He lives!

17:00.762 --> 17:02.829
Happy housewarming, kid.

17:02.863 --> 17:05.696
Don't look so glad
to see me. Thanks.

17:05.732 --> 17:07.866
Interesting decor.

17:07.900 --> 17:09.501
It's, uh, subtle.

17:09.535 --> 17:12.236
The whole minimalist thing
never really blew my hair back,

17:12.270 --> 17:13.270
but hey.

17:13.304 --> 17:16.738
So, how are you doing?

17:16.772 --> 17:18.406
You staying clean?

17:20.309 --> 17:21.476
Good.

17:21.510 --> 17:22.544
I was kind of worried

17:22.578 --> 17:23.811
that you were back to old habits,

17:23.846 --> 17:26.080
since I didn't hear from you,
you know?

17:26.115 --> 17:28.616
Realize how stupid it is

17:28.650 --> 17:30.317
to ignore your
counsel's phone calls?

17:30.352 --> 17:31.985
What if I was trying to warn you

17:32.020 --> 17:33.787
that the DEA was going
to kick down your door?

17:33.821 --> 17:35.188
I mean, what then, huh?

17:35.222 --> 17:36.789
Why don't you spare me the sermon

17:36.823 --> 17:38.390
and get to why you're here?

17:38.424 --> 17:39.657
Fair enough.

17:39.692 --> 17:41.159
Remember the other day

17:41.193 --> 17:42.659
when I brought up the idea

17:42.694 --> 17:44.761
of you getting back in touch
with your, uh, partner?

17:44.795 --> 17:47.630
Well, I kind of wanted
to refloat that boat.

17:47.664 --> 17:50.732
I'm not suggesting that you
yourself get back to cooking,

17:50.767 --> 17:52.534
I mean, you being in rehab and all.

17:52.568 --> 17:55.270
I only want you to
convince the master chef

17:55.304 --> 17:56.470
to do his thing,

17:56.505 --> 17:59.506
so what do you say?

17:59.541 --> 18:01.375
Sure, man. Whatever.

18:01.409 --> 18:02.909
Okay. Whatever what?

18:02.944 --> 18:05.545
I mean, you going to call him?

18:05.579 --> 18:07.146
I said I'll handle it.

18:07.181 --> 18:08.882
Now bounce, will you?

18:08.916 --> 18:09.882
Please?

18:09.917 --> 18:11.283
Final thought.

18:13.019 --> 18:14.119
Look at this place.

18:14.153 --> 18:15.388
You're house poor.

18:15.422 --> 18:16.824
You got no bankroll.

18:16.859 --> 18:18.729
If you get the maestro
cooking again,

18:18.764 --> 18:20.798
I'll make it worth your while.

18:22.867 --> 18:23.934
Call him.

19:10.606 --> 19:12.273
<i>Hey, if you're trying to
sell me something,</i>

19:12.307 --> 19:13.741
<i>I've got four little
words for you--</i>

19:13.775 --> 19:15.075
<i>do not call list.</i>

19:15.110 --> 19:17.344
<i>However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.</i>

19:40.096 --> 19:42.096
Schrader.

19:42.131 --> 19:44.097
Yes, sir? Yeah, what's up?

19:46.634 --> 19:47.700
Yeah?

19:49.502 --> 19:51.636
Wow!

19:51.670 --> 19:54.008
That's great news, sir. Thank you.

19:55.011 --> 19:56.277
Ah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely.

19:56.311 --> 19:57.444
You can bet on that.

19:58.680 --> 20:00.547
Hey, listen, thanks again, sir.

20:00.582 --> 20:02.216
I really appreciate you
stepping to the plate.

20:02.250 --> 20:03.250
Thank you.

20:07.421 --> 20:09.255
You going to keep me
in suspense or what?

20:09.289 --> 20:10.422
What's the good news?

20:10.456 --> 20:12.323
Merkert called in a
couple of favors.

20:12.357 --> 20:14.792
El Paso wants me back. Aaah!

20:14.826 --> 20:18.161
Hey, man, congrats, man.
That's fantastic.

20:18.196 --> 20:19.663
Thank you. Yeah.

20:20.998 --> 20:22.465
Yeah.

21:03.433 --> 21:04.900
Hello.

26:37.280 --> 26:39.181
<i>Hey, if you're trying to
sell me something,</i>

26:39.215 --> 26:40.618
<i>I've got four little
words for you--</i>

26:40.652 --> 26:41.920
<i>do not call list.</i>

26:41.954 --> 26:44.660
<i>However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.</i>

26:56.186 --> 26:57.856
<i>Hey, if you're trying to
sell me something,</i>

26:57.890 --> 26:59.158
<i>I've got four little
words for you--</i>

26:59.192 --> 27:00.492
<i>do not call list.</i>

27:00.526 --> 27:02.594
<i>However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.</i>

27:05.564 --> 27:07.331
<i>Hey, if you're trying to
sell me something,</i>

27:07.365 --> 27:08.698
<i>I've got four little
words for you--</i>

27:13.869 --> 27:15.303
Mmm.

27:49.561 --> 27:51.196
Oh, sweetheart.

27:51.230 --> 27:53.931
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

27:53.966 --> 27:57.568
It's okay. It's okay, my girl.

27:57.602 --> 28:00.703
Oh, yes. It's okay.

28:00.737 --> 28:03.572
It's okay. Mama's got you.

28:03.606 --> 28:07.274
Oh, Mama's got you, yeah.

28:07.309 --> 28:09.544
Yes. Oh.

28:11.513 --> 28:13.780
Skyler, want some help?

28:25.226 --> 28:27.993
Skyler, can I use the bathroom?

28:41.468 --> 28:42.468
G--.

29:01.555 --> 29:03.222
What do you mean?
Against your will?

29:03.256 --> 29:06.024
Yes. Very much against my will.

29:06.059 --> 29:08.193
He just-- He-
He showed right back up,

29:08.227 --> 29:10.361
and he-- he doesn't want a divorce.

29:10.396 --> 29:12.696
Won't even consider it.

29:12.731 --> 29:16.634
I-- I called the police on him.

29:16.668 --> 29:19.203
I-- I was-- I was so clo--

29:20.539 --> 29:21.772
So close to what?

29:21.806 --> 29:23.773
Nothing. Never mind.

29:23.808 --> 29:27.643
Skyler, I can't advise you properly

29:27.677 --> 29:29.345
if you don't give me all the facts.

29:29.379 --> 29:31.580
Understand I am bound

29:31.614 --> 29:33.181
by the attorney-client privilege

29:33.215 --> 29:35.183
to keep everything
you tell me a secret.

29:35.217 --> 29:38.786
I can't tell a soul unless
you authorize me to.

29:38.820 --> 29:41.555
Even if it's something illegal?

29:41.589 --> 29:44.457
Especially if it's illegal.

29:44.491 --> 29:46.392
I'm your lawyer, not the police.

29:46.426 --> 29:49.494
My job is to protect you.

29:58.436 --> 30:01.204
My husband makes meth.

30:02.906 --> 30:04.874
Methamphetamine.

30:08.144 --> 30:09.611
Your husband's a drug dealer.

30:09.645 --> 30:10.678
A manufacturer.

30:10.713 --> 30:13.814
Technically, they, uh,

30:13.849 --> 30:16.684
they-- they call them cooks.

30:16.718 --> 30:19.019
I looked it up on the Internet.

30:19.053 --> 30:23.189
This is my advice,
and you should take it.

30:23.224 --> 30:25.925
Sue your husband for
divorce immediately.

30:25.959 --> 30:27.726
Let me go to the police

30:27.761 --> 30:29.895
and tell them what
you've just told me.

30:29.929 --> 30:31.229
I'll go in ex parte

30:31.263 --> 30:33.631
and get a restraining order
from the court today.

30:33.665 --> 30:35.733
If he comes anywhere near
you and your children,

30:35.767 --> 30:38.568
he goes straight to jail,
no questions asked.

30:38.603 --> 30:40.303
This is a no-brainer.

30:40.338 --> 30:43.340
It's the best thing for
you and your family.

30:45.677 --> 30:47.044
I can't.

30:50.081 --> 30:51.181
I can't do it.

30:52.217 --> 30:56.020
I don't want my son to find out

30:56.054 --> 30:58.122
that his father is a criminal.

30:58.156 --> 30:59.990
I just--

31:01.593 --> 31:03.427
I can't do that to him.

31:03.461 --> 31:07.064
In the end,
it may not be up to you.

31:07.098 --> 31:09.600
Drug dealers have a
way of getting caught.

31:12.037 --> 31:15.639
Walt has lung cancer.

31:15.674 --> 31:17.708
His treatment bought him some time,

31:17.742 --> 31:19.176
but the doctors, they all say

31:19.210 --> 31:20.877
that sooner or later--

31:20.912 --> 31:24.081
But I can't see why

31:24.115 --> 31:26.283
I should lay all this on my family

31:26.317 --> 31:29.420
when...things may--

31:31.690 --> 31:36.160
resolve themselves on their own

31:36.194 --> 31:40.397
without anyone else knowing.

31:46.441 --> 31:48.710
Man, did I lose a bet or something?

31:50.579 --> 31:52.013
What are we doing in this shithole?

31:52.047 --> 31:53.248
Just relax, will you?

31:53.282 --> 31:56.017
Relax? This is the kind
of place you get knifed.

31:56.051 --> 31:57.619
We should have went
to Chili's, man.

31:57.653 --> 31:59.387
All right, already. J----.

31:59.421 --> 32:01.122
Outback Steakhouse.

32:01.157 --> 32:02.157
It's not too late.

32:02.191 --> 32:04.159
They got that Blooming Onion.

32:04.193 --> 32:06.595
What's wrong with spicing
things up a little bit, huh?

32:06.629 --> 32:11.232
This spice looks like it's been
through a couple of guys already.

32:11.267 --> 32:13.935
So when are you headed
back down to El Paso?

32:13.969 --> 32:15.270
Uh, you know,

32:15.304 --> 32:18.306
between the packing
and errands and, uh,

32:18.340 --> 32:21.042
getting my ducks in a row,
maybe, um, a week or two.

32:21.077 --> 32:23.011
A week or two? Come on, man.

32:23.045 --> 32:24.980
I'd be dying to get
back in the action.

32:25.014 --> 32:27.514
Yeah, well, it's not like there's
nothing going on up here.

32:27.549 --> 32:28.881
What are you talking about?

32:28.916 --> 32:30.582
There ain't jack going on up here.

32:30.617 --> 32:33.185
It's quiet as hell.

32:33.219 --> 32:35.454
I'm going to hit the head.

33:07.186 --> 33:08.686
Those two over there.

33:10.122 --> 33:11.456
I think they're holding.

33:13.659 --> 33:14.826
Man, in this place,

33:14.860 --> 33:16.527
the bartender's probably holding.

33:21.666 --> 33:22.800
All right.

33:22.834 --> 33:24.134
Whoa. What are you doing?

33:24.169 --> 33:25.435
Calling APD. What do you think?

33:25.470 --> 33:27.904
Since when can't we handle
a couple of dirtballs?

33:27.939 --> 33:29.439
Come on, man. Courtesy call.

33:29.474 --> 33:32.342
What if Vice is running
some kind if undercover op?

33:35.980 --> 33:39.549
Screw it. It's your turn to pay.

34:14.237 --> 34:15.469
Where are you going?

34:15.505 --> 34:16.737
I have to take a leak.

34:16.772 --> 34:19.107
J----, get yourself some Flomax.

34:30.518 --> 34:31.918
Stand up.

34:38.690 --> 34:43.024
Do you got a problem
with us, bitch?

34:43.058 --> 34:44.658
Your move.

35:12.875 --> 35:15.175
DEA! Don't move.

35:21.347 --> 35:23.247
Go tell my partner to
get his ass in here.

35:58.017 --> 35:59.751
<i>Hey, if you're trying to
sell me something,</i>

35:59.785 --> 36:01.219
<i>I've got four little
words for you--</i>

36:01.253 --> 36:02.654
<i>do not call list.</i>

36:02.688 --> 36:05.322
<i>However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.</i>

36:16.432 --> 36:18.100
<i>Hey, if you're trying to
sell me something,</i>

36:18.134 --> 36:19.801
<i>I've got four little
words for you--</i>

36:19.835 --> 36:21.035
<i>do not call--</i>

36:34.414 --> 36:36.616
<i>We're sorry. You have
reached a number</i>

36:36.650 --> 36:40.252
<i>that has been disconnected or
is no longer in service.</i>

38:02.951 --> 38:03.950
Come on.

38:20.335 --> 38:20.368
Skyler.

38:24.872 --> 38:26.406
Can we talk?

38:42.354 --> 38:44.521
ASAC wants to see you.

38:46.657 --> 38:47.857
And?

38:47.891 --> 38:50.993
We're hanging back.
Saw a deal go down.

38:51.027 --> 38:52.694
I went outside to call it in.

38:52.729 --> 38:55.030
You stayed to keep an
eye on the suspects.

38:55.064 --> 38:56.697
That's when they attacked you.

39:03.404 --> 39:04.771
What I didn't tell them

39:04.805 --> 39:06.739
is that you left your
gun under the seat

39:06.774 --> 39:09.341
before you went back inside.

39:25.023 --> 39:27.457
I've done a terrible thing,

39:27.492 --> 39:29.826
but I did it for a good reason.

39:31.962 --> 39:34.563
I did it for us.

39:36.132 --> 39:38.800
That...

39:38.834 --> 39:42.136
is college tuition
for Walter Junior

39:42.170 --> 39:44.037
and Holly,

39:44.072 --> 39:45.705
18 years down the road.

39:45.740 --> 39:46.940
Huh?

39:49.677 --> 39:53.546
Then it's health insurance
for you and the kids,

39:53.580 --> 39:56.082
for Junior's physical therapy,

39:56.116 --> 39:59.318
his SAT tutor.

40:01.221 --> 40:04.490
It's money for groceries

40:04.524 --> 40:07.093
and gas,

40:07.127 --> 40:11.530
for birthdays and
graduation parties.

40:14.201 --> 40:16.301
Skyler, that money

40:16.336 --> 40:19.037
is for this roof over your head,

40:19.071 --> 40:21.672
the mortgage that you are not
going to be able to afford

40:21.707 --> 40:24.742
on a part-time bookkeeper's
salary when I'm gone.

40:24.776 --> 40:26.444
Walt, I-- Please.

40:26.478 --> 40:28.212
Please.

40:33.918 --> 40:36.552
This money...

40:36.587 --> 40:38.554
I didn't steal it.

40:38.589 --> 40:41.991
it doesn't belong to anyone else.

40:42.025 --> 40:43.925
I earned it.

40:45.528 --> 40:47.962
The things I've...

40:47.996 --> 40:52.032
done to earn it...

40:52.066 --> 40:53.399
the...

40:57.837 --> 40:58.904
the...

40:58.938 --> 41:02.373
things I've hato do,

41:02.407 --> 41:06.709
I've got to live with them.

41:13.082 --> 41:14.383
Skyler.

41:17.720 --> 41:19.722
All that I've done,

41:19.756 --> 41:23.659
all the sacrifices that I have...

41:23.694 --> 41:25.729
made for this family,

41:25.763 --> 41:28.668
all of that will be for nothing

41:28.702 --> 41:31.907
if you don't accept
what I've earned.

41:33.110 --> 41:34.481
Please.

41:38.659 --> 41:41.563
I'll be here when you
get home from work.

41:43.968 --> 41:46.269
You can give me your answer then.

42:08.692 --> 42:10.193
Hey, Sky.

42:10.227 --> 42:11.327
Hi.

43:07.617 --> 43:08.617
Ahem.

43:08.651 --> 43:10.853
Uh, some coffee?

43:11.888 --> 43:12.921
Yeah.

43:14.023 --> 43:15.891
That report's looking real good.

43:15.925 --> 43:18.627
That-- I like how it looks. Good.

43:27.403 --> 43:29.337
Are your kids home?

43:32.574 --> 43:33.775
Ahem.

44:08.376 --> 44:09.910
<i>Ooh! Ooh!</i>

44:09.945 --> 44:11.445
<i>Ooh, it's here, it's here!</i>

44:15.417 --> 44:17.753
Hello, Mrs. White.

44:17.787 --> 44:20.623
Oh. Hi, Louis.

44:20.657 --> 44:23.426
Hey, uh, thanks for
having me over for dinner.

44:24.762 --> 44:25.996
Um, sure.

44:26.030 --> 44:28.365
Hey, Skyler.

44:28.400 --> 44:32.102
I'm, uh, cooking dinner.

44:32.137 --> 44:34.071
Pot roast.

44:34.105 --> 44:36.206
Uh, could you--

44:56.087 --> 44:58.888
So how was your day?

45:00.657 --> 45:02.191
Good.

45:02.225 --> 45:05.060
Good. Excellent.

45:05.094 --> 45:06.595
I hope you don't mind.

45:06.629 --> 45:10.699
I invited Louis to stay
for dinner tonight,

45:10.733 --> 45:11.967
you know, as a thank you

45:12.001 --> 45:15.270
for driving Walter
Junior to school for us.

45:15.305 --> 45:18.240
We've been kind of absent,

45:18.275 --> 45:22.812
but I tell you,
Louis really pitched in.

45:25.216 --> 45:26.884
Um...

45:29.153 --> 45:32.688
Look, I just want to say that I--

45:32.722 --> 45:34.622
I feel good about our
talk this morning,

45:34.656 --> 45:35.889
and I'm-- I'm very eager

45:35.924 --> 45:37.990
to hear what you're
thinking about--

45:38.025 --> 45:39.958
about what we talked about.

45:39.993 --> 45:41.192
But, you know,

45:41.227 --> 45:43.027
whenever you're ready, of course.

45:44.829 --> 45:45.895
Yeah.

45:48.364 --> 45:49.464
Hmm.

45:49.499 --> 45:53.802
Honesty is good. Don't you think?

46:03.012 --> 46:04.179
There.

46:16.625 --> 46:18.760
I fucked Ted.

46:27.770 --> 46:29.804
Boys, dinner.

46:35.477 --> 46:36.577
Thank you. Louis?

46:36.611 --> 46:38.512
Uh, yes, please. All right.

46:38.546 --> 46:39.713
Thank you.

46:40.981 --> 46:43.483
I want you boys both to
eat your salad, okay?

46:43.517 --> 46:44.584
Okay.

46:44.618 --> 46:45.985
I know.

46:46.019 --> 46:47.720
Nobody likes salad,

46:47.754 --> 46:50.089
but it's good for you.

46:50.123 --> 46:51.657
Thanks, darling. Thank you.
