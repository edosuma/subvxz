It must be nice to have someone
  give you a birthday party.

00:05.639 --> 00:06.871
          Well, you should know.

00:06.873 --> 00:08.873
    You must have had hundreds--
          Thousands of 'em.

00:08.875 --> 00:11.243
  Oh, I have never had
a birthday party, master.

00:11.245 --> 00:13.911
    You--? You've never had--?
 Well, how can that be, Jeannie?

00:13.913 --> 00:15.313
   I do not know
when my birthday is.

00:16.450 --> 00:18.050
I'm afraid there's
no way to find out.

00:18.052 --> 00:19.851
You-- You see, it all
happened so long ago,

00:19.853 --> 00:21.153
that it's almost impossible--

00:21.155 --> 00:22.554
                   Jeannie!
             What are you doing?

00:22.556 --> 00:23.822
             Doing?

00:23.824 --> 00:25.190
            I hate to seem rude,
                 but, uh...

00:25.192 --> 00:26.391
                one of your feet
                   is missing.

         TONY & ROGER:
       What's happening?

00:30.797 --> 00:33.465
  Whenever I get very unhappy,
       I begin to vanish.

00:33.467 --> 00:35.567
What are you going
  to do, master?

00:35.569 --> 00:37.803
            Jeannie,
     you can't stay there.

00:37.805 --> 00:40.405
  Now, pull yourself together
        and go on home.

00:40.407 --> 00:43.675
I have tried, master.
    It is no use.

00:43.677 --> 00:45.677
Oh, I have become so unhappy

00:45.679 --> 00:47.679
because I do not know
when my birthday is,

00:47.681 --> 00:49.214
that I have lost my power.

                   Sorry.

00:53.353 --> 00:55.153
Is, uh, part of Jeannie
still missing?

00:55.155 --> 00:56.488
            Yeah, I'm afraid so.

     half a genie is better
       than none at all.

00:59.660 --> 01:01.125
That's what they say.

01:01.127 --> 01:03.428
   Yeah, Roger, we've gotta find
     out when her birthday is.

01:03.430 --> 01:05.096
Well, back to ERIC.

01:05.099 --> 01:06.564
 Who is this ERIC?

01:06.566 --> 01:08.700
  ERIC is a computing machine,
          uh, Jeannie.

01:08.702 --> 01:11.036
  It's the greatest mechanical
      brain in the world.

01:11.038 --> 01:14.706
A-and this machine knows
  when my birthday is?

01:14.708 --> 01:17.376
Well, it will when we're through
  feeding it some information.

         characteristics, right?

05:06.640 --> 05:08.707
          We have to find out
      Jeannie's characteristics,

05:08.709 --> 05:11.175

   we come up with her birthday.

where would we find a book
  on astrology at NASA?

 Now, we know Jeannie was born
           in 64 B.C.

05:27.094 --> 05:29.193
     Now, all we have to do
  is feed her characteristics

05:29.195 --> 05:30.328
        to the machine.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.029
       And the fact that Neptune
             was in Scorpio

05:32.031 --> 05:34.298
when she was born, we'll come up
      with the whole thing.

05:34.300 --> 05:36.267
      All right, we'll do it.
         And you know why?

05:36.269 --> 05:37.268
              Why?

05:37.270 --> 05:38.803
      Because I'm desperate.

05:38.805 --> 05:42.206
  I'm telling you, it'll work.
         It's a cinch.

05:42.208 --> 05:44.342

     is program her personality.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.610

05:45.612 --> 05:46.611
       What do you mean?

it's really quite urgent.

    I'd rather lie down.

What's your problem?

07:24.678 --> 07:28.580
           Well, it all started
         when I was a small boy.

   It sounds like
a girlfriend of mine.

07:37.356 --> 07:39.757
    Let's see...

07:39.759 --> 07:41.960
                 And then
         when I was 3 years old,

07:41.962 --> 07:43.661
                 I wanted a dog.

07:43.663 --> 07:45.897
                 Oh, not just
              any kind of a dog.

07:45.899 --> 07:47.431
             No, not for me. I--

07:47.433 --> 07:48.666
             I wanted a mongrel.

07:48.668 --> 07:49.667
             Uh, major--

07:49.669 --> 07:50.969
            Is that significant,
                   doctor?

07:50.971 --> 07:54.438
      If you could just tell me
        what your problem is.

07:54.440 --> 07:55.573
              I'm getting there.

07:55.575 --> 07:58.075
              My father wouldn't
                 buy me a dog.

07:58.077 --> 08:00.478
                 So I stole one.

                         Major,

08:02.181 --> 08:04.983
   General Peterson is waiting
         for this report.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.618
      If your dog can wait.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.519
           Oh, the dog can wait,
                  I can't.

08:08.521 --> 08:11.289
    You see, when I walk down
 the street now and I see a dog,

08:11.291 --> 08:16.527
 I have this terrible compulsion
          to kidnap it.

08:16.529 --> 08:17.528
             Kidnap it?

08:17.530 --> 08:18.530
            [LAUGHS]

08:18.532 --> 08:20.365
         Oh, it's not just dogs.

08:20.367 --> 08:23.835
         It's chickens and sheep
          and goats and horses--

08:23.837 --> 08:25.836
           Just a moment.

08:25.838 --> 08:28.439
Let me get my pad.

08:28.441 --> 08:32.443
Now, uh, you were saying
 that you had this urge

08:32.445 --> 08:35.647
to kidnap horses?

08:35.649 --> 08:42.086
    "Mischievous...
    and optimistic."

08:42.087 --> 08:44.989
    Ah, there,
that should do it.

08:44.991 --> 08:48.225
    Now, ERIC, you've got
to come through for us, ERIC.

08:48.227 --> 08:50.127
I've never asked you to do
    any favors before.

08:50.129 --> 08:53.631
        Okay?

08:53.633 --> 08:58.403
    And so, in less than a year,
        I collected 33 dogs,

08:58.405 --> 09:02.607
   27 cats, seven horses, and...

09:04.010 --> 09:05.543
                 And a milk cow.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.978
That's the most amazing thing
I've ever heard.

09:07.980 --> 09:12.317
       Um, where do you keep
     all these animals, major?

09:12.319 --> 09:17.756
       Oh, in-- In barns mostly.

09:17.758 --> 09:18.856
         Why, that's amazing.

09:18.858 --> 09:20.424

Oh, yeah.

Well, I'm going to start
    writing this up.

                about the fish.

09:27.533 --> 09:29.600
                         Yes.

09:32.538 --> 09:34.172
Fine machine you are.

09:34.174 --> 09:36.741

 that happened 2000 years ago.

    We did it!

09:49.356 --> 09:51.756
       Oh, I'm so happy,
         I'll kiss you.

09:51.758 --> 09:54.392

        a girl machine.

                happened to me.

09:57.230 --> 09:59.564
       That's not so unusual,
               major.

09:59.566 --> 10:02.601
             And then it started
                talking to me.

10:02.603 --> 10:06.905
             You mean,
      it, uh, moved its mouth?

10:06.907 --> 10:08.205
               I mean it talked.

10:08.207 --> 10:09.474
          What did it say?

10:09.476 --> 10:11.475
         Well, it had this high,
          squeaky, little voice,

You're looking at some

21:12.972 --> 21:14.538
of the greatest figures
      in history.

21:14.540 --> 21:18.175
                     Oh, yes.

21:18.177 --> 21:20.077
Sir, I knew this day
  was gonna come.

21:20.079 --> 21:21.645
  I might as well
tell you everything.

21:21.647 --> 21:23.180
             Yes, and after
            you've told me,

21:23.182 --> 21:25.683
   you think that I'm gonna rush
  back and tell General Peterson

21:25.685 --> 21:27.885
        that you're entertaining
         Cleopatra, Shakespeare,

21:27.887 --> 21:29.553
            and King Henry VIII?

21:29.555 --> 21:32.089
    Yes, well--
                    No, major.

21:32.091 --> 21:34.592
       I don't know why you have
          these guilt feelings

21:34.594 --> 21:37.327
           about not inviting me
          to your costume party,

21:37.329 --> 21:40.764
   but we'll settle that at our
  next little session, won't we?

21:40.766 --> 21:41.765
Cos--? Costume party?

21:41.767 --> 21:43.934
                You know, uh,
            some of the costumes

21:43.936 --> 21:46.136
       are, uh, quite effective.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.871
Although...

21:47.873 --> 21:50.807
  I think you're overdoing
the padding a bit, don't you?

21:50.809 --> 21:53.443
Oh, uh, Mr. Shakespeare?

21:53.445 --> 21:55.246
I've enjoyed your work.

21:55.248 --> 21:56.247
             Thank you.

21:56.249 --> 21:58.349
  And, uh, who are you
    supposed to be?

21:58.351 --> 22:01.818
      I am Dr. Sigmund Freud.

22:01.820 --> 22:05.656
Oh, I am a psychiatrist too.

22:08.761 --> 22:12.029
     Hm, well, uh,
enjoy your party, major.

22:12.031 --> 22:13.497
Yes.
  I'll see you in the morning.

   Jeannie.

22:25.544 --> 22:26.543
    Je--

22:26.545 --> 22:28.011
        Is everything all right,
                 master?

22:28.013 --> 22:29.413
Nothing is all right.

22:29.415 --> 22:30.581
  Do you know
how close I came

22:30.583 --> 22:32.449
to getting thrown out
of the space program?

22:32.451 --> 22:34.985
         Oh, I am sorry, master.

22:34.987 --> 22:36.987
 You're sorry. Listen,
get rid of these people.

22:36.989 --> 22:37.988
        But you just said that--

22:37.990 --> 22:39.389
   Yeah, I know,
but get rid of them.

22:39.391 --> 22:40.591
                    Oh.

22:40.593 --> 22:42.759
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
    All except Dr. Freud.

22:42.761 --> 22:43.793
Um, oh, doctor?

22:43.795 --> 22:45.895
     May I see you
for just a moment, sir?

22:45.897 --> 22:48.932
Uh, you see, I have
 a little problem,

22:48.934 --> 22:50.134
and seeing you're here,

22:50.136 --> 22:51.868
I might as well use
   your talents.

22:51.870 --> 22:53.570
I, uh-- I'm an astronaut.

22:53.572 --> 22:56.039
And one day, I landed
  on this-- This--

22:56.041 --> 22:57.441
Well, this deserted island,

22:57.443 --> 22:59.009
and I picked up a genie
    out of a bottle

22:59.011 --> 23:00.177
and ever since, I--

23:00.179 --> 23:01.778
  I haven't had
a night's sleep...

23:06.252 --> 23:08.251
             [♪♪♪]

23:11.156 --> 23:12.355
           Good morning, master.

23:12.357 --> 23:14.591
Good morning, Jeannie.

23:14.593 --> 23:16.426
             Did you sleep well,
                   master?

23:16.428 --> 23:19.530
Well, to tell you the truth,
I was a little excited to sleep.

23:19.532 --> 23:22.499
It's not every day a guy gets
to chat with Cleopatra

23:22.501 --> 23:24.535
and Henry VIII and
Sigmund Freud, huh?

23:24.537 --> 23:27.103
          It was a lovely party,
            was it not, master?

23:27.105 --> 23:28.338
Well, that it was.

23:28.340 --> 23:31.041
          I can hardly wait
     for Major Healey to return,

23:31.043 --> 23:33.243
         so that I can find out
       when my real birthday is.

23:33.245 --> 23:34.444
        Hm.
                      Oh!

23:34.446 --> 23:36.246
      It is so exciting to think
           that from now on,

23:36.248 --> 23:39.215
   I am going to have a birthday
      just like everyone else.

23:39.217 --> 23:40.417
Yeah, that's right.

23:40.419 --> 23:43.086
      Each year I am going
      to be a year older.

23:43.088 --> 23:44.087
         That's right.

23:44.089 --> 23:46.923
          A year older.

23:46.925 --> 23:49.259
                    Oh, oh.

23:50.830 --> 23:51.829
                    [YELPS]

23:51.831 --> 23:52.996
                 Master, look.
         Hm?

23:52.998 --> 23:54.665
        Look, look, right there,
              right there.

23:54.667 --> 23:56.467
            There is a wrinkle.
          Right-- No, no, there.

23:56.469 --> 23:59.135
Oh, that's not a wrinkle.
That's not a wrinkle, Jeannie.

23:59.137 --> 24:00.303
                 It certainly is
                    a wrinkle.

24:00.305 --> 24:01.872
              That was not there
                  yesterday.

24:01.874 --> 24:03.340
                I am getting old
                  and wrinkled.

24:03.342 --> 24:06.543
             Oh, do you realize
              that every year

24:06.545 --> 24:08.111
  I am going to be a year older?

24:08.113 --> 24:10.247
            Oh, if I had known
          that having a birthday

24:10.249 --> 24:11.482
      was going to be like this,

24:11.484 --> 24:13.350
   I would have never of allowed
          you to find out

24:13.352 --> 24:14.451
       when my real birthday is.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.219
           Oh, this will make me
            so nervous, master.

24:16.221 --> 24:17.220
               This is terrible.

24:17.222 --> 24:18.522
            Why did you allow me
                 to do this?

24:18.524 --> 24:19.623
              You are my master.

24:19.625 --> 24:21.191
              You were supposed
             to take care of me.

24:21.193 --> 24:22.826
                  After all,
             I'm only a genie...
