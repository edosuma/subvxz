WEBVTT

00:01.069 --> 00:03.737
DO YOU SWEAR TO TELL THE TRUTH,
THE WHOLE TRUTH,

00:03.771 --> 00:05.273
AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH,
SO HELP YOU GOD?

00:05.306 --> 00:06.607
I DO.

00:06.640 --> 00:08.709
WOULD YOU PLEASE
STATE AND SPELL YOUR NAME

00:08.742 --> 00:10.378
AND GIVE
YOUR OCCUPATION?

00:10.411 --> 00:11.579
BRENDA LEIGH JOHNSON.

00:11.612 --> 00:12.746
B-R-E-N-D-A.

00:12.780 --> 00:13.747
L-E-I-G-H.

00:13.781 --> 00:15.349
J-O-H-N-S-O-N.

00:15.383 --> 00:19.120
DEPUTY CHIEF L.A.P.D.,
MAJOR CRIMES DIVISION.

00:21.722 --> 00:24.392
MS. BALDWIN.
DIRECT?

00:24.425 --> 00:27.361
THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

00:27.395 --> 00:28.596
GOOD MORNING,
CHIEF JOHNSON.

00:34.502 --> 00:36.770
Brenda:
YOU MAY THINK YOU'RE WALKING
AWAY FROM THIS A FREE MAN,

00:36.804 --> 00:38.439
BUT I ASSURE YOU,
YOU ARE IN MORE TROUBLE

00:38.472 --> 00:39.707
THAN YOU COULD POSSIBLY
IMAGINE.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.342
I HOPE
THAT'S NOT A THREAT.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.711
I KNOW THE WOMEN YOU RAPED
AND THE WOMAN YOU MURDERED.

00:43.744 --> 00:46.614
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

00:48.216 --> 00:50.284
WHAT IS IT
YOU HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH?

00:50.318 --> 00:52.453
Brenda: TO SEE YOU ON TRIAL
FOR MURDER, MR. STROH.

00:52.486 --> 00:54.122
Baldwin:
CHIEF JOHNSON?

00:54.155 --> 00:55.123
YES.

00:55.156 --> 00:56.657
GOOD MORNING.

00:56.690 --> 01:00.561
CHIEF JOHNSON, ON THE MORNING
OF FEBRUARY 15th OF THIS YEAR,

01:00.594 --> 01:03.264
WHILE MAJOR CRIMES WAS COVERING
FOR HOLLYWOOD HOMICIDE,

01:03.297 --> 01:05.733
WERE YOU CALLED
TO ROOM 116

01:05.766 --> 01:08.402
OF THE CRYSTAL MOTEL
ON SUNSET BOULEVARD?
I WAS.

01:08.436 --> 01:11.272
AND CAN YOU TELL THE COURT
WHAT YOU DISCOVERED IN THE ROOM

01:11.305 --> 01:13.807
REGISTERED TO THE DEFENDANT,
GEORGE HARRIS?

01:13.841 --> 01:15.643
I FOUND THE DEAD BODY
OF GWENNYTH ADLER.

01:20.281 --> 01:23.484
PEOPLE'S EXHIBIT 34-B.

01:28.789 --> 01:31.359
THAT'S A NASTY BRUISE
ABOVE HER EYE.

01:31.392 --> 01:33.494
NOT NASTY ENOUGH
TO KILL HER.

01:33.527 --> 01:35.129
HOW'D SHE DIE?

01:35.163 --> 01:37.331
NOT SURE, BUT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN
VERY LONG AGO --

01:37.365 --> 01:38.899
MAYBE FIVE, SIX HOURS?

01:38.932 --> 01:41.802
CHIEF, THE HOUSEKEEPER STARTED
HER SHIFT AT 6:00 A.M.,

01:41.835 --> 01:44.705
NOTICED THE FRONT DOOR
OF THE ROOM SLIGHTLY OPEN.

01:44.738 --> 01:47.808
WHEN SHE WENT TO CLOSE IT,
SHE SAW THE BODY AND CALLED 911.

01:47.841 --> 01:49.477
I DON'T SEE ANY LUGGAGE.

01:49.510 --> 01:50.678
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
SHE WAS PLANNING A LONG STAY.

01:50.711 --> 01:52.780
WELL, CRYSTAL MOTEL
CLIENTELE

01:52.813 --> 01:54.648
TYPICALLY DON'T NEED A ROOM
MORE THAN AN HOUR.

01:54.682 --> 01:56.384
Gabriel:
YEAH, BUT HER BLOUSE IS RIPPED.

01:56.417 --> 01:58.219
HER JEANS ARE TORN.

01:58.252 --> 02:00.788
I MEAN, WOULDN'T A PROSTITUTE
TAKE BETTER CARE OF HER CLOTHES?

02:00.821 --> 02:03.357
WELL, IF SHE WAS A HOOKER,
SHE WASN'T A PRO.

02:03.391 --> 02:06.260
THERE'S A WALLET, DRIVER'S
LICENSE, CREDIT CARD, SOME CASH,

02:06.294 --> 02:08.362
AND A WORK I.D. --
GWENNYTH ADLER.

02:08.396 --> 02:11.299
SHE WAS A NURSE AT
ST. LEO'S CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL.

02:11.332 --> 02:12.733
SHE'S GOT A RECEIPT HERE

02:12.766 --> 02:15.269
FROM STELLA'S NIGHTCLUB
OVER IN CULVER CITY --

02:15.303 --> 02:17.238
10:32 P.M. LAST NIGHT.

02:17.271 --> 02:18.939
ONE DRINK ON HER TAB.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.641
THAT'S KIND OF SAD.

02:20.674 --> 02:22.743
YESTERDAY WAS VALENTINE'S,
AND SHE WENT OUT ALONE?

02:22.776 --> 02:24.745
LOOKING FOR MR. GOODBAR.

02:24.778 --> 02:26.280
MAYBE SHE FOUND HIM.

02:26.314 --> 02:28.849
I DID, TOO, CHIEF.
HIS NAME'S GEORGE HARRIS.

02:28.882 --> 02:32.453
THE MANAGER SAID HE SIGNED IN
LAST NIGHT AROUND 10:00 P.M.

02:32.486 --> 02:33.821
REQUESTING
TWO ROOM KEYS.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.389
TWO KEYS?
TWO.

02:35.423 --> 02:37.491
USING HIS DRIVER'S LICENSE
AND A $100 CASH DEPOSIT,

02:37.525 --> 02:39.427
WHICH HE HASN'T COME BACK
TO CLAIM.

02:39.460 --> 02:41.662
AND WE HAVE HIS DRIVER'S LICENSE
RIGHT HERE.

02:41.695 --> 02:43.664
Gabriel: YEAH, BUT HE GOT
THE ROOM AT 10:00 P.M.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.266
GWENNYTH WAS STILL AT THE CLUB
AFTER THAT.

02:45.299 --> 02:46.867
SO HARRIS
BOOKS THE ROOM,

02:46.900 --> 02:48.969
PLANNING -- OR HOPING, MAYBE --
TO BRING SOMEONE BACK HERE.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.804
LIEUTENANT,
DID THE MANAGER REMEMBER

02:50.838 --> 02:52.706
SEEING GWENNYTH
AND MR. HARRIS TOGETHER?

02:52.740 --> 02:53.774
NO.

02:53.807 --> 02:55.776
BUT I RAN HARRIS UP.

02:55.809 --> 02:58.679
12 MONTHS AGO,
HE WAS ARRESTED FOR RAPE.

02:58.712 --> 03:01.749
THE D.A. DROPPED THE CHARGES,
NEVER WENT TO TRIAL.

03:01.782 --> 03:04.518
OH, AND THE MANAGER SAID
HARRIS WAS DRIVING A CAB.

03:04.552 --> 03:07.688
OH, CONVENIENT -- BOOK A ROOM
AND THEN TROLL THE NEIGHBORHOOD

03:07.721 --> 03:10.224
LOOKING FOR DRUNK GIRLS
COMING OUT OF BARS.

03:10.258 --> 03:12.526
BUT HE ASKED FOR TWO ROOM KEYS.
WHY TWO?

03:12.560 --> 03:14.862
IT WAS HIS PARTNER
WHO RAPED THOSE WOMEN.

03:15.463 --> 03:16.997
MAYBE HE HAD A PARTNER.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.467
AH, LET'S NOT GET AHEAD
OF OURSELVES HERE.

03:19.500 --> 03:22.270
DETECTIVE SANCHEZ,
I WANT A WANT OUT ON MR. HARRIS.

03:22.303 --> 03:23.504
I WANT TO TALK TO HIM.

03:23.537 --> 03:24.705
LIEUTENANT, FIND OUT
EVERYTHING YOU CAN

03:24.738 --> 03:26.374
ABOUT HIS PREVIOUS ARREST.

03:26.407 --> 03:28.476
DETECTIVE GABRIEL,
PLEASE SPEAK TO THE EMPLOYEES

03:28.509 --> 03:30.010
ON DUTY
AT STELLA'S LAST NIGHT.

03:30.043 --> 03:33.747
SEE IF ANYONE REMEMBERS GWENNYTH
OR SAW HER WITH MR. HARRIS.

03:33.781 --> 03:36.484
MAYBE HE'S THE TYPE OF CABBIE
THAT LIKED TO DRINK AND DRIVE.

03:36.517 --> 03:37.918
KENDALL --
YOU WANT A RAPE KIT.

03:37.951 --> 03:39.887
I DO. I ALSO WANT TO KNOW
HOW SHE DIED.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.755
Dr. Morales:
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

03:41.789 --> 03:44.292
26-YEAR-OLD FEMALE
IN OTHERWISE PERFECT HEALTH.

03:44.325 --> 03:45.893
NO SEVERE TRAUMA.

03:45.926 --> 03:47.961
IT SCREAMS OVERDOSE, BUT I WON'T
BE ABLE TO TELL YOU FOR CERTAIN

03:47.995 --> 03:50.298
UNTIL I LOOK
AT THE TOX SCREEN.

03:50.331 --> 03:52.466
WHAT ABOUT THESE BRUISES
ON HER ARMS AND HER HEAD?

03:52.500 --> 03:54.502
DON'T LOOK LIKE
SIGNS OF ASSAULT.

03:54.535 --> 03:58.506
MORE LIKE, I DON'T KNOW,
SHE WAS...HANDLED, MAYBE?

03:58.539 --> 04:01.542
LIKE SHE PASSED OUT AND SOMEONE
COULD HAVE HELPED HER UP?

04:01.575 --> 04:03.611
MORE LIKE
DRAGGED HER INTO POSITION.
HER SHOES LOOKED FINE.

04:03.644 --> 04:05.446
WELL, THEY COULD HAVE BEEN
PULLED OFF OF HER,

04:05.479 --> 04:06.814
ALONG WITH HER CLOTHES,

04:06.847 --> 04:09.617
BECAUSE I ALSO FOUND SEMEN
ON HER NECK AND STOMACH.

04:09.650 --> 04:12.453
SO, I'M GUESSING
SHE WAS DRUGGED AND RAPED.

04:12.486 --> 04:13.854
Stroh: OBJECTION!

04:13.887 --> 04:15.889
MS. BALDWIN HAS NOT PRESENTED
ANY EVIDENCE OF RAPE.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.492
MY CLIENT
ADMITTED TO CONSENSUAL SEX,

04:18.526 --> 04:20.594
AND AT THE TIME, THE CORONER
FOUND NO PROOF OF DRUGS.

04:20.628 --> 04:22.296
Baldwin:
THE PATHOLOGIST'S REPORT

04:22.330 --> 04:24.498
HAS ALREADY BEEN ENTERED INTO
EVIDENCE WITHOUT OBJECTION,

04:24.532 --> 04:28.669
AND DR. MORALES FOUND ROHYPNOL
IN MS. ADLER'S BLOOD.

04:28.702 --> 04:30.003
HE COULD NOT,
HOWEVER, TESTIFY

04:30.037 --> 04:31.739
AS TO HOW THE DRUG
WAS ADMINISTERED,

04:31.772 --> 04:33.474
AND NEITHER CAN
ANYONE ELSE.

04:33.507 --> 04:36.076
ROHYPNOL IS CALLED "THE DATE
RAPE DRUG" FOR A REASON.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.911
OBJECTION.
YOUR HONOR, PLEASE.

04:37.945 --> 04:38.946
Judge Crosby: SUSTAINED.

04:38.979 --> 04:40.414
SIDEBAR, UP HERE.

04:44.785 --> 04:47.688
THIS IS THE SIXTH TIME
I'VE HAD TO OBJECT TO THE MANNER

04:47.721 --> 04:49.923
IN WHICH CLAIRE STRAYS FROM
THE BOUNDARIES YOU LAID OUT.

04:49.957 --> 04:53.461
YOUR HONOR, I'M TRYING
TO ESTABLISH THAT MISS ADLER

04:53.494 --> 04:55.596
WAS UNABLE TO GIVE CONSENT
IN HER DRUGGED STATE,

04:55.629 --> 04:58.098
WHICH IS THE PRECONDITION
FOR RAPE.

04:58.131 --> 05:01.769
AND I AM WARNING YOU, CLAIRE,
STICK TO THE EVIDENCE.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.471
WHAT IS THE NAME
OF YOUR PARTNER?

05:03.504 --> 05:05.873
IT'S MY LAWYER. IT'S MR. STROH.

05:05.906 --> 05:12.045
I PROMISE YOU MY OBJECTIONS WILL
END UP MUCH WORSE THAN HIS.

05:15.716 --> 05:18.018
Brenda: I WILL HUNT RELENTLESSLY
TO TIE YOU TO THESE CRIMES

05:18.051 --> 05:19.387
UNTIL THE DAY YOU DIE.

05:24.024 --> 05:28.596
CHIEF JOHNSON,
I'M REPHRASING THE QUESTION.

05:28.629 --> 05:30.664
BASED ON YOUR YEARS
OF EXPERIENCE,

05:30.698 --> 05:32.833
THE EVIDENCE COLLECTED
AT THE MOTEL,

05:32.866 --> 05:34.902
AND THE PRELIMINARY
AUTOPSY REPORT,

05:34.935 --> 05:37.671
WHAT KIND OF INVESTIGATION
WERE YOU CONDUCTING?

05:37.705 --> 05:39.039
THE CIRCUMSTANCES
LED ME TO BELIEVE

05:39.072 --> 05:40.741
THAT GWENNYTH ADLER
HAD BEEN MURDERED.

05:40.774 --> 05:43.411
AND WHY WERE YOU SO INTERESTED
IN TALKING TO THE DEFENDANT?

05:43.444 --> 05:46.414
HE SEEMED TO BE THE LAST PERSON
TO HAVE SEEN HER ALIVE.

05:46.447 --> 05:49.483
ALSO, HE'D RUN OFF AND LEFT
HIS DRIVER'S LICENSE BEHIND.

05:49.517 --> 05:51.652
I DIDN'T WANT HIM
DRIVING AROUND WITHOUT IT.

05:51.685 --> 05:54.555
YES, LIEUTENANT PROVENZA.
ANY PROGRESS?

05:54.588 --> 05:56.957
Provenza:
WELL, NO LUCK FINDING HARRIS.

05:56.990 --> 05:59.793
SANCHEZ PARKED TWO UNIFORMS
OUTSIDE HIS HOUSE,

05:59.827 --> 06:01.128
BUT HE HASN'T SHOWN UP.

06:01.161 --> 06:02.830
WELL, HE CAN'T DISAPPEAR
FOREVER.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.832
WELL, HE MAY WANT TO.

06:04.865 --> 06:08.436
YOU REMEMBER HARRIS'
PREVIOUS ARREST FOR RAPE?
HELLO.

06:08.469 --> 06:11.439
WELL, EXACT SAME SCENARIO.

06:11.472 --> 06:13.140
Woman woke up
in a motel room

06:13.173 --> 06:16.076
and realized that she'd been
sexually assaulted.

06:16.109 --> 06:18.712
RAPE KIT CAME BACK
WITH A DNA MATCH TO HARRIS

06:18.746 --> 06:20.781
AND A SECOND
UNIDENTIFIED ASSAILANT.

06:20.814 --> 06:22.850
THAT'S WHY HE ASKED FOR TWO KEYS
TO THE MOTEL ROOM.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.852
HE HAD A PARTNER.

06:24.885 --> 06:28.589
YEAH, NOW, THE PREVIOUS
VICTIM -- HER NAME'S
NATALIE GILBERT,

06:28.622 --> 06:31.124
CLAIMED THAT SHE "CAME TO"
DURING THE SECOND ASSAULT.

06:31.158 --> 06:33.961
IDENTIFIED HARRIS, SAID
SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO THE SAME

06:33.994 --> 06:35.663
FOR HIS PARTNER
IN A LINE-UP.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.164
SO WHY WAS HE LET GO?

06:37.197 --> 06:38.666
OKAY, CHIEF.

06:38.699 --> 06:40.801
JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH THE D.A.'s OFFICE.

06:40.834 --> 06:44.004
BEFORE THEY COULD GET TO COURT,
MS. GILBERT DISAPPEARED.

06:44.037 --> 06:46.607
They couldn't prosecute the rape
case without the victim.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.609
So all charges against Harris
were dropped,

06:48.642 --> 06:50.544
ALONG WITH THE SEARCH
FOR HIS PARTNER.

06:50.578 --> 06:52.546
Oh, and get this, Chief.

06:52.580 --> 06:54.548
GUESS WHO REPRESENTED HARRIS
IN HIS FIRST RAPE CASE?

06:55.949 --> 06:56.917
WHO?

06:56.950 --> 06:57.985
HOLD ON TO YOUR HAT.

06:58.018 --> 06:59.520
PHILLIP STROH.
PHILLIP STROH.

07:00.554 --> 07:01.922
WHAT?!
WHY'D YOU TELL HER THAT?!

07:01.955 --> 07:03.924
What? She's going to
find that out!

07:03.957 --> 07:05.659
DON'T TELL HER THINGS LIKE THAT
ON THE PHONE!

07:05.693 --> 07:06.827
CHIEF?

07:06.860 --> 07:07.961
CHIEF?

07:07.995 --> 07:09.730
PHILLIP STROH
DEFENDED HARRIS?

07:09.763 --> 07:12.165
NOW, CHIEF, THERE IS
ABSOLUTELY NO PROOF

07:12.199 --> 07:15.235
THAT STROH
IS THE SECOND RAPIST.

07:15.268 --> 07:18.472
YOU KNOW THAT HE WAS ALWAYS
VERY CAREFUL

07:18.506 --> 07:20.808
NOT TO LEAVE
ANY DNA BEHIND.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.676
PLUS THE FACT

07:22.710 --> 07:25.913
he specializes in representing
sex-crime defendants.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.748
YES, I KNOW.
I REMEMBER.

07:29.182 --> 07:32.019
HE SAID IT
GAVE PURPOSE TO HIS LIFE.
IT GIVES PURPOSE
TO MY LIFE.

07:32.052 --> 07:34.688
IF HE DEFENDED HARRIS
IN HIS FIRST CASE,

07:34.722 --> 07:37.090
THE HE PROBABLY KNOWS
WHERE HE IS NOW.

07:37.124 --> 07:38.859
AND I KNOW
HOW TO FIND STROH.

07:40.528 --> 07:42.896
HUH

07:42.930 --> 07:44.765
DAMN IT, CHIEF.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.535
HOW LONG YOU BEEN TRACKING
STROH'S CAR WITH A GPS MARKER?

07:47.568 --> 07:49.670
SINCE THE DAY AFTER THE
JOHNSON RULE WENT INTO EFFECT.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.271
DON'T WORRY.
I HAVE A WARRANT.

07:51.304 --> 07:55.809
AND LOOK -- THERE'S STROH'S CAR
AND THE SUSPECT'S TAXI.

07:55.843 --> 07:57.678
THEY'RE HERE, TOGETHER.

07:57.711 --> 07:59.246
POPE KNOW ABOUT THIS?

07:59.279 --> 08:00.514
HMM?

08:00.548 --> 08:01.949
I'LL TAKE THAT
AS A "NO."

08:17.164 --> 08:19.299
GEORGE HARRIS,
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET

08:19.332 --> 08:22.069
DEPUTY CHIEF JOHNSON
OF THE L.A.P.D.

08:23.571 --> 08:24.838
DON'T RUN, GEORGE.

08:24.872 --> 08:26.073
HEY, GET OVER HERE!

08:27.808 --> 08:29.009
GET UP! GET UP!

08:29.042 --> 08:30.210
SORRY.

08:30.243 --> 08:32.646
HE'S NOT THE BRIGHTEST GUY
ON EARTH.

08:32.680 --> 08:33.981
MR. STROH.

08:34.014 --> 08:37.618
CONSORTING WITH RAPE SUSPECTS,
AS USUAL?

08:37.651 --> 08:39.987
YOUR SUSPECTS
ARE MY CLIENTS.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.622
AND SEX
ISN'T ALWAYS RAPE.

08:41.655 --> 08:44.124
MURDER UPS THE STAKES
A LITTLE.

08:45.225 --> 08:46.894
AND DNA CAN BE VERY HELPFUL
IN COURT.

08:48.596 --> 08:50.864
IF YOU HAVE A SAMPLE, YES.

08:50.898 --> 08:53.801
HERE, LET ME HELP YOU
WITH THAT.

09:06.013 --> 09:07.881
Raydor: CHIEF JOHNSON.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.618
YES, CAPTAIN.
I'M SORRY.

09:10.651 --> 09:12.886
I UNDERSTAND
YOU APPREHENDED YOUR SUSPECT

09:12.920 --> 09:14.755
WHEN HE WAS WITH
PHILLIP STROH?

09:14.788 --> 09:17.891
YES, AND NOW MR. HARRIS,
THE RAPING TAXI DRIVER,

09:17.925 --> 09:19.693
WON'T EVEN TALK TO US.

09:19.727 --> 09:21.829
PHILLIP STROH WAS PART OF
THE FEDERAL LAWSUIT AGAINST YOU.

09:21.862 --> 09:25.332
I AM STILL UNABLE TO PROVE WHO
THE LEAK IS IN YOUR DIVISION.

09:25.365 --> 09:27.067
TREAD LIGHTLY.

09:27.100 --> 09:29.970
THE FEDERAL LAWSUIT IS SETTLED.
GOLDMAN IS ANCIENT HISTORY.

09:30.003 --> 09:32.906
WHO'S THE LEAK GONNA HAVE LEFT
TO INFORM, YOU?

09:32.940 --> 09:35.876
WOULDN'T THAT BE GREAT?

09:41.381 --> 09:43.250
CHIEF?

09:44.317 --> 09:47.220
UH, CHIEF, THIS IS TOMMY,
THE DOORMAN AT STELLA'S,

09:47.254 --> 09:49.690
WHERE OUR VICTIM WENT OUT
LAST NIGHT.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.158
AND THIS IS CHARLIE.
HE TENDED BAR.

09:51.191 --> 09:52.960
GENTLEMEN.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.662
THEY BOTH IDENTIFIED MR. HARRIS
AS THE TAXICAB DRIVER

09:54.695 --> 09:56.697
WHO PICKED UP GWENNYTH ADLER
FROM THE CLUB LAST NIGHT.

09:56.730 --> 09:59.399
Y'ALL ARE CERTAIN?
YEAH, I HAD TO HELP HIM
GET THE GIRL INSIDE THE CAB.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.101
HOW WAS SHE?
MMM.

10:01.134 --> 10:04.738
FOR SURE, SHE WAS TOO DRUNK
TO DRIVE, BUT I'VE SEEN WORSE.

10:04.772 --> 10:07.074
AND WHO CALLED FOR HER RIDE?
Charlie: PROBABLY NO ONE.

10:07.107 --> 10:10.010
I MEAN, IT'S PRETTY
COMMON FOR CABS TO LINE
UP OUTSIDE THE BAR.

10:10.043 --> 10:12.379
DID EITHER OF YOU SEE
MR. HARRIS AND GWENNYTH

10:12.412 --> 10:14.648
INSIDE THE BAR TOGETHER
LAST NIGHT?

10:14.682 --> 10:15.983
THE GIRL WENT IN,

10:16.016 --> 10:18.251
BUT I DON'T REMEMBER
THE CAB DRIVER GOING INSIDE.

10:18.285 --> 10:20.287
I-IT WAS A BUSY NIGHT.
LADIES GOT IN FREE.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.955
IT WAS VALENTINE'S DAY
AND ALL.

10:21.989 --> 10:23.724
OKAY.

10:23.757 --> 10:28.929
HOW ABOUT ANY OF THESE MEN HERE?
ANYONE'S FACE RING A BELL?

10:28.962 --> 10:31.031
UH, THIS GUY I KNOW.

10:31.064 --> 10:32.966
HE WAS INSIDE THE BAR
LAST NIGHT?

10:33.000 --> 10:34.367
NO. NO.
UH, EARLY THIS AFTERNOON.

10:34.401 --> 10:36.336
THAT'S HOW WE FOUND OUT
ABOUT GWENNYTH.

10:37.337 --> 10:39.907
YEAH, HE -- HE LEFT
RIGHT BEFORE YOUR GUYS
CAME IN LOOKING FOR US.

10:41.374 --> 10:44.377
WHAT IN THE HELL
IS PHILLIP STROH
DOING IN A SIX

10:44.411 --> 10:46.680
HE'S A SUSPECT
IN A RAPE AND MURDER.

10:46.714 --> 10:48.348
NO, HE'S REPRESENTING
THE SUSPECT.

10:48.381 --> 10:50.217
YEAH, WELL.
THAT, TOO.
IT IS HIS M.O.,
CHIEF.

10:50.250 --> 10:52.452
DO YOU HEAR YOURSELF,
CHIEF JOHNSON?
STROH LIKES BLONDES.

10:52.485 --> 10:55.022
AND HE WORKS IN TANDEM
WITH A WEAKER PARTNER,

10:55.055 --> 10:56.389
WHO HELPS PLAN THE RAPES.

10:56.423 --> 10:59.059
HE ALSO ACTS AS THEIR ATTORNEY
AFTER THEY'RE CAUGHT

10:59.092 --> 11:00.728
AND THEN RUNS AROUND
AFTERWARD

11:00.761 --> 11:03.731
INTRODUCING HIMSELF TO POSSIBLE
WITNESSES AS THE LAWYER.

11:03.764 --> 11:05.465
WE JUST SETTLED
A FEDERAL LAWSUIT,

11:05.498 --> 11:07.868
IN WHICH STROH ACCUSED YOU
OF HARASSMENT!

11:07.901 --> 11:10.303
OH, YES. I REMEMBER
THE CREATION OF THE
JOHNSON RULE VERY WELL.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.439
Baldwin:
I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF BEEF

11:12.472 --> 11:15.042
YOU HAVE WITH PHILLIP STROH,
AND I DON'T CARE.

11:15.075 --> 11:18.011
YOU HAVE NO EVIDENCE THAT
HE WAS GEORGE HARRIS' PARTNER.

11:18.045 --> 11:20.047
IN FACT,
YOUR LITTLE GPS MARKER

11:20.080 --> 11:22.716
PROVES THAT HIS CAR WAS AT HOME
DURING THE ATTACK.

11:22.750 --> 11:25.719
BECAUSE HE WAS IN THE CAB.
THEY'RE PARTNERS.
IF YOU INTEND TO MENTION STROH
AS A SUSPECT,

11:25.753 --> 11:27.120
I WILL NOT PROCEED
TO ARRAIGNMENT.

11:27.154 --> 11:28.789
THE CASE IS SPOTTY
AS IT IS.

11:28.822 --> 11:31.058
HARRIS ASKED FOR TWO KEYS
TO THAT MOTEL ROOM!

11:31.091 --> 11:32.793
Pope:
ALL RIGHT. EXCUSE ME.

11:32.826 --> 11:35.362
CLAIRE, WHAT CHARGES
IS THE STATE PREPARED TO FILE

11:35.395 --> 11:37.397
AGAINST THIS TAXI DRIVER
RIGHT NOW?

11:37.430 --> 11:41.334
IF THE DNA CONFIRMS IT,
I CAN MAKE A CASE FOR RAPE

11:41.368 --> 11:43.737
BASED ON THE FACT
THAT GWENNYTH ADLER

11:43.771 --> 11:46.473
MIGHT HAVE BEEN DRUGGED AND
WAS UNABLE TO GIVE HER CONSENT.

11:46.506 --> 11:48.976
BUT UNLESS I CAN PROVE
HARRIS OR A PARTNER

11:49.009 --> 11:52.112
ADMINISTERED THAT DRUG
AND THAT IT KILLED HER,

11:52.145 --> 11:53.747
THERE'S NO MURDER HERE.

11:53.781 --> 11:55.215
BUT YOU CAN CHARGE HIM
WITH HOMICIDE

11:55.248 --> 11:57.117
AND THEN USE THAT
TO MAKE HIM GIVE UP STROH.

11:57.150 --> 11:59.152
LET ME BE CLEAR WITH YOU
ON THIS.

11:59.186 --> 12:00.988
I DON'T
FILE MURDER CHARGES

12:01.021 --> 12:03.757
AS SOME KIND
OF BARGAINING CHIP.

12:03.791 --> 12:05.859
MAYBE OTHER PROSECUTORS
YOU WORK WITH DO THAT.

12:05.893 --> 12:07.227
BUT I STICK WITH
THE EVIDENCE,

12:07.260 --> 12:10.430
BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT GETS ADMITTED INTO COURT.

12:10.463 --> 12:14.501
HARRIS HAS LAWYERED UP.
HE WAS NEVER INSIDE STELLA'S.

12:14.534 --> 12:16.069
HE WON'T ADMIT
TO ANYTHING NOW.

12:16.103 --> 12:17.971
SO HOW YOU CAN CALL HIM
A MURDERER, I DON'T KNOW.

12:18.005 --> 12:21.174
HE LEFT HIS DRIVER'S LICENSE
AS A DEPOSIT ON A MOTEL ROOM

12:21.208 --> 12:22.910
WHERE WE FOUND
A DEAD RAPE VICTIM.

12:22.943 --> 12:25.545
PROVE HE LEFT HER THERE
KNOWING SHE WAS DEAD,

12:25.578 --> 12:28.048
PROVE SHE WAS
UNABLE TO GIVE HER CONSENT --

12:28.081 --> 12:29.449
BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT I HAVE TO DO.

12:30.918 --> 12:32.786
ANYTHING ELSE,
CHIEF JOHNSON?

12:32.820 --> 12:35.989
HARRIS' LAST VICTIM REPORTED
WAKING UP DURING HER RAPE.

12:36.023 --> 12:38.325
SHE MAY BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY
HER ATTACKER.

12:38.358 --> 12:39.426
TERRIFIC.

12:39.459 --> 12:41.094
WHERE IS SHE,
THE LAST VICTIM?

12:42.863 --> 12:44.364
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

12:44.397 --> 12:47.467
SO NOTHING THAT HAPPENED TO HER
CAN BE INTRODUCED AT TRIAL.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.269
Taylor:
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, CLAIRE,

12:49.302 --> 12:51.905
BUT THIS CASE WON'T SEE
THE INSIDE OF A COURTROOM

12:51.939 --> 12:54.341
FOR, WHAT, MAYBE A YEAR?

12:54.374 --> 12:57.044
SURELY CHIEF JOHNSON CAN FIND
HARRIS' PREVIOUS VICTIM

12:57.077 --> 12:59.112
BEFORE YOU GET TO COURT
ON THIS NEW ONE.

12:59.146 --> 13:00.480
I GUARANTEE IT.

13:00.513 --> 13:01.915
AND IF GWENNYTH ADLER
WAS DRUGGED,

13:01.949 --> 13:03.884
EVEN IF HARRIS
DIDN'T DRUG HER HIMSELF,

13:03.917 --> 13:06.286
HE WAS PART OF THE PLAN,
AND THAT'S FELONY MURDER.

13:06.319 --> 13:09.189
I ONLY GO TO COURT
WITH CASES I CAN WIN.

13:09.222 --> 13:11.992
IF IT TURNS OUT
SHE WAS OVERDOSED

13:12.025 --> 13:14.294
AND THE DNA HIT
COMES BACK TO HARRIS,

13:14.327 --> 13:16.563
IT IMPROVES MY ODDS,

13:16.596 --> 13:19.299
BUT I WILL NEED YOU
TO FIND ME THE FIRST VICTIM

13:19.332 --> 13:22.035
IF THIS IS WHAT
YOU REALLY WANT TO DO.

13:22.069 --> 13:24.171
I SAID I'D DO IT,
AND I WILL.

13:24.204 --> 13:26.006
Pope:
AND IN THE MEANTIME,

13:26.039 --> 13:29.142
UNLESS THERE IS CONVINCING
EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY,

13:29.176 --> 13:31.211
YOU WILL TREAT STROH
AS A DEFENSE ATTORNEY

13:31.244 --> 13:32.980
AND NOT AS A SUSPECT.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.181
IS THAT CLEAR?

13:34.214 --> 13:36.149
OH, YES, SIR.
YOU'RE ALWAYS CLEAR.

13:36.183 --> 13:40.854
SO? WHAT'S HER NAME,
THE FIRST VICTIM?

13:40.888 --> 13:42.355
MARILYN MONROE.

13:42.389 --> 13:45.092
MARILYN MONROE
NOT ACCORDING TO MY RECORDS.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.260
THAT'S THE NAME
SHE GAVE THE LONG BEACH P.D.

13:47.294 --> 13:48.528
WHEN THEY PICKED HER UP

13:48.561 --> 13:50.597
AND PUT HER ON A 72-HOUR
MENTAL-HEALTH HOLD.

13:50.630 --> 13:53.166
OH, NO.
SHE'S MENTALLY IMPAIRED?

13:53.200 --> 13:55.568
WELL, DIAGNOSED
MANIC-DEPRESSIVE.

13:55.602 --> 13:57.137
BUT THE OFFICERS DID FIND

13:57.170 --> 13:59.239
AN EXPIRED L.A. DRIVER'S LICENSE
ON HER PERSON.

13:59.272 --> 14:02.275
IT MATCHES THE NAME OF HARRIS'
FIRST VICTIM -- NATALIE GILBERT.

14:02.309 --> 14:03.510
SO, IT COULD BE HER.

14:03.543 --> 14:06.079
THEY'VE GOT HER
BACK ON HER MEDS.

14:06.113 --> 14:08.882
THAT EXPLAINS WHY
THEY DROPPED THE CHARGES
IN HER FIRST CASE.

14:08.916 --> 14:10.317
D.A.s LIKE
MY FRIEND BALDWIN HERE

14:10.350 --> 14:11.618
WON'T PROSECUTE RAPISTS

14:11.651 --> 14:13.954
IF THEIR VICTIMS WON'T HOLD UP
ON THE STAND.

14:13.987 --> 14:16.456
WIN, WIN, WIN --
THAT'S ALL SHE CARES ABOUT.

14:16.489 --> 14:18.325
SO COMPETITIVE.

14:24.664 --> 14:27.600
YOU GOT TO GIVE STROH CREDIT
FOR RUSHING YOU TO TRIAL.

14:27.634 --> 14:30.370
YOU WANT ME TO SEE
IF MARILYN MONROE'S LUCID?

14:30.403 --> 14:32.973
YES, YES -- PLEASE FIND OUT
IF NATALIE OR MARILYN

14:33.006 --> 14:34.674
OR WHATEVER SHE'S
CALLING HERSELF

14:34.707 --> 14:36.443
CAN MAKE
A PRESENTABLE WITNESS.

14:36.476 --> 14:38.678
AND THEN GIVE ME A SIGNAL
WHEN YOU COME BACK?

14:38.711 --> 14:40.047
ALL RIGHT.
THANKS.

14:42.315 --> 14:44.551
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
IT'S TIME.

14:44.584 --> 14:47.187
I FOUND HARRIS' PREVIOUS VICTIM,
LIKE I TOLD YOU I WOULD.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.655
SO TIMELY, TOO.
WHERE IS SHE?

14:48.688 --> 14:50.090
I-I DON'T KNOW.

14:50.123 --> 14:52.192
BUT YOU NEED TO ASK FOR
A CONTINUANCE.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.227
SORRY, I'LL NEED SOMETHING
APPROACHING ACTUAL EVIDENCE

14:54.261 --> 14:55.929
TO GET HIS HONOR TO GRANT US
MORE TIME.

14:55.963 --> 14:57.264
I HOPE YOU'RE READY
FOR YOUR CROSS.

14:57.297 --> 14:58.265
IT'S GOING TO BE
A TOUGH ONE.

14:58.298 --> 15:00.033
Man: ALL RISE!

15:00.067 --> 15:01.668
OKAY, WE'RE BACK.

15:03.003 --> 15:06.139
CHIEF JOHNSON,
YOU ARE STILL UNDER OATH.

15:06.173 --> 15:08.041
MR. STROH, YOUR WITNESS.

15:08.075 --> 15:09.342
Stroh:
THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

15:11.211 --> 15:15.282
CHIEF JOHNSON, THE DNA SAMPLE
YOU OFFERED AS EVIDENCE

15:15.315 --> 15:19.052
SUGGESTS THAT MR. HARRIS AND
MS. ADLER HAD SEXUAL RELATIONS.

15:19.086 --> 15:20.353
IS THAT TRUE?

15:20.387 --> 15:21.688
IT DOES MORE THAN THAT.

15:21.721 --> 15:23.223
IT SUGGESTS
THAT YOUR CLIENT RAPED HER.

15:23.256 --> 15:25.225
YOUR HONOR,
COULD THE COURT ASK

15:25.258 --> 15:28.361
THAT CHIEF JOHNSON REFRAIN
FROM EDITORIAL COMMENTARY?

15:28.395 --> 15:29.662
IT'S NOT AN OPINION.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.398
GEORGE HARRIS
HAD SEX WITH GWENNYTH ADLER

15:31.431 --> 15:33.733
WHEN SHE WAS UNCONSCIOUS
AND UNABLE TO GIVE CONSENT.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.068
SHE WAS DRUGGED.

15:35.102 --> 15:36.336
I'M SORRY.
DID I MISS SOMETHING?

15:36.369 --> 15:38.238
WERE YOUR PATHOLOGISTS
ABLE TO PINPOINT

15:38.271 --> 15:40.007
EXACTLY WHEN
THAT DRUG WAS TAKEN?

15:43.110 --> 15:44.544
YOUR HONOR?

15:44.577 --> 15:49.416
CHIEF JOHNSON, I BELIEVE
THE QUESTION BEFORE YOU IS,

15:49.449 --> 15:52.052
"DID THE PATHOLOGISTS DETERMINE
WHEN THE DRUG WAS TAKEN?"

15:52.085 --> 15:53.320
NO.

15:53.353 --> 15:55.055
SO IT'S POSSIBLE
MS. ADLER TOOK THE DRUG

15:55.088 --> 15:57.257
AFTER HAVING SEXUAL RELATIONS
WITH MR. HARRIS?

15:57.290 --> 15:58.325
NO.
WHY NOT?

15:58.358 --> 15:59.626
MS. ADLER WAS A NURSE.

15:59.659 --> 16:01.628
SHE HAD ACCESS
TO ALL SORTS OF MEDICATIONS.

16:01.661 --> 16:04.197
ISN'T IT JUST AN
ASSUMPTION ON YOUR PART
THAT SHE WAS DRUGGED?

16:04.231 --> 16:06.066
NO.
WHY NOT?

16:06.099 --> 16:08.035
THE DOORMAN AND THE BARTENDER
REMEMBER PUTTING HER IN A CAB.

16:08.068 --> 16:09.136
SHE WAS ALREADY --

16:09.169 --> 16:10.237
SHE WAS CONSCIOUS,
WAS SHE NOT?

16:10.270 --> 16:11.571
YES, BUT --

16:11.604 --> 16:13.573
AND SHE WAS...AT A CLUB.

16:13.606 --> 16:15.242
IT WAS VALENTINE'S DAY.

16:15.275 --> 16:17.577
ISN'T IT POSSIBLE THAT SOMEBODY
BOUGHT HER A FEW DRINKS?

16:17.610 --> 16:19.112
MAYBE.

16:19.146 --> 16:21.081
YES OR NO? IS IT POSSIBLE
THAT SOMEBODY ELSE --

16:21.114 --> 16:22.249
YES!

16:22.282 --> 16:23.550
YES.

16:23.583 --> 16:26.219
YOUR HONOR, PERMISSION
TO APPROACH THE WITNESS.

16:26.253 --> 16:27.120
GO AHEAD.

16:32.159 --> 16:35.128
THIS IS THE AUTOPSY REPORT
FOR GWENNYTH ADLER.

16:35.162 --> 16:38.498
CAN YOU READ WHAT IT SAYS HERE
UNDER "CAUSE OF DEATH"?

16:41.701 --> 16:43.270
OVERDOSE.

16:43.303 --> 16:45.004
OVERDOSE.

16:46.306 --> 16:48.675
AND HOW ABOUT HERE,
UNDER "MANNER OF DEATH"?

16:48.708 --> 16:50.477
THIS IS AN INCOMPLETE
REPORT.

16:50.510 --> 16:53.380
CAN YOU READ WHAT IT SAYS,
PLEASE, UNDER MANNER OF DEATH?

16:53.413 --> 16:54.414
"UNDETERMINED."

16:54.447 --> 16:55.715
UNDETERMINED.

16:58.351 --> 16:59.652
NOT MURDER.

17:00.820 --> 17:02.355
UNDETERMINED.

17:02.389 --> 17:05.358
AND AT THE TIME
OF HIS ARREST,

17:05.392 --> 17:07.727
YOU SUSPECTED
THAT MR. HARRIS HAD A PARTNER.

17:07.760 --> 17:10.097
WAS THIS BECAUSE
WHEN HE CHECKED INTO HIS HOTEL

17:10.130 --> 17:11.131
HE ASKED FOR TWO KEYS?

17:11.164 --> 17:12.432
IN PART, YES.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.668
I HAVE TWO KEYS TO MY CAR.

17:16.803 --> 17:18.371
TWO KEYS TO MY HOUSE.

17:18.405 --> 17:21.541
TELL ME, CHIEF JOHNSON,
DOES THAT MAKE ME A RAPIST?

17:21.574 --> 17:23.143
Baldwin: OBJECTION.
SUSTAINED.

17:23.176 --> 17:24.344
WITHDRAWN.

17:26.479 --> 17:29.716
THE AUTOPSY REPORT
FOR GWENNYTH ADLER

17:29.749 --> 17:31.484
SAYS THAT SHE DIED
OF AN OVERDOSE,

17:31.518 --> 17:35.155
NOT SEXUAL RELATIONS
WITH MR. HARRIS.

17:35.188 --> 17:37.857
SO DOESN'T THIS MURDER CHARGE
AGAINST MY CLIENT

17:37.890 --> 17:40.793
HINGE ENTIRELY ON THIS
IMAGINARY PARTNER
YOU'VE CREATED FOR HIM?

17:40.827 --> 17:41.794
NO.

17:43.396 --> 17:46.533
SO YOU'VE IDENTIFIED
A SECOND SUSPECT IN THE CASE?

17:50.437 --> 17:52.139
CHIEF JOHNSON?

17:52.172 --> 17:53.673
YOUR HONOR?

17:53.706 --> 17:57.310
CHIEF JOHNSON, HAVE YOU
IDENTIFIED A SECOND SUSPECT?

17:58.345 --> 18:00.313
YES.

18:00.347 --> 18:02.349
AND WHO WOULD THAT BE?

18:02.382 --> 18:03.516
OBJECTION.

18:03.550 --> 18:05.785
OVERRULED.
THE WITNESS WILL ANSWER.

18:05.818 --> 18:09.356
DO YOU HAVE
A SECOND SUSPECT?

18:09.389 --> 18:11.424
YOU!
MY SECOND SUSPECT IS YOU!

18:12.225 --> 18:14.361
AND FOR THE RECORD,
I MEAN PHILLIP STROH.

18:14.394 --> 18:17.730
THAT'S IT!
BAILIFF, CLEAR THE COURT!

18:17.764 --> 18:20.433
ALL RIGHT.
MR. STROH, OVER HERE.

18:20.467 --> 18:21.834
MS. BALDWIN, GET UP HERE.

18:30.910 --> 18:32.912
YOU JUST GUARANTEED US
A MISTRIAL.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.714
YOU'RE WELCOME.

18:44.257 --> 18:46.826
CHIEF JOHNSON,
IS MR. STROH

18:46.859 --> 18:48.728
REALLY A SUSPECT
IN YOUR INVESTIGATION?

18:48.761 --> 18:50.463
YES, SIR. HE IS.

18:50.497 --> 18:52.832
YOUR HONOR, THIS IS A DESPERATE
MOVE BY THE PROSECUTION,

18:52.865 --> 18:54.367
UNSUBSTANTIATED
BY THE RULES OF EVIDENCE,

18:54.401 --> 18:55.735
TO RESET
THESE PROCEEDINGS.

18:55.768 --> 18:57.704
THEY HAVE NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
OF MURDER --

18:57.737 --> 18:59.239
OTHER THAN THE BODY,
YOU MEAN.

18:59.272 --> 19:00.707
AND THE ISSUE OF MS. ADLER'S
LACK OF CONSENT

19:00.740 --> 19:02.475
TO SEXUAL RELATIONS
IS PURE CONJECTURE.

19:02.509 --> 19:03.910
NOT TRUE.

19:03.943 --> 19:06.246
WE HAVE TOXICOLOGY REPORTS
THAT SHE OVERDOSED ON A DRUG

19:06.279 --> 19:08.415
THAT, AS A NURSE, SHE WOULD HAVE
KNOWN WOULD HAVE KILLED HER.

19:08.448 --> 19:11.751
GIVEN TO HER
BY AN IMAGINARY SECOND SUSPECT.

19:11.784 --> 19:14.687
NOW, CHIEF JOHNSON
POINTED THE FINGER AT ME,

19:14.721 --> 19:15.955
BUT IT COULD JUST AS WELL
HAVE BEEN

19:15.988 --> 19:17.890
ANYBODY
IN HER IMMEDIATE VICINITY.

19:19.226 --> 19:21.394
MS. BALDWIN, DID I MISS

19:21.428 --> 19:23.663
SOME MENTION OF MR. STROH
IN DISCOVERY?

19:23.696 --> 19:25.898
Brenda: MURDER SUSPECTS
AREN'T ALWAYS TOLD

19:25.932 --> 19:27.300
THAT THEY'RE UNDER
INVESTIGATION.

19:28.468 --> 19:30.837
I'M DECLARING A MISTRIAL.

19:30.870 --> 19:35.742
AND WE WILL RECONVENE
IN JULY.

19:35.775 --> 19:39.212
MS. BALDWIN, YOU HAVE FOUR WEEKS
TO GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER.

19:39.246 --> 19:40.680
I UNDERSTAND.
YES, SIR.

19:40.713 --> 19:43.216
YOUR HONOR, IN LIGHT
OF D.D.A. BALDWIN'S

19:43.250 --> 19:45.318
FAILURE TO PROVIDE MY CLIENT
WITH A SPEEDY TRIAL,

19:45.352 --> 19:47.787
I ASK THAT HE BE
ALLOWED TO PRESENT BAIL.

19:47.820 --> 19:49.689
WHAT DOES
DEFENSE REQUEST?

19:49.722 --> 19:51.524
$75,000.

19:52.959 --> 19:54.594
MS. BALDWIN,

19:54.627 --> 19:58.698
WHAT DOES THE STATE SAY
TO $75,000?

19:58.731 --> 20:01.434
YOUR HONOR,
THE STATE WOULD BE SATISFIED

20:01.468 --> 20:05.805
WITH A BAIL
SET AT $25,000.

20:05.838 --> 20:08.708
MS. BALDWIN,
YOU CONFUSE ME.

20:08.741 --> 20:11.478
BUT WHATEVER.

20:11.511 --> 20:14.981
$25,000 IT IS,
AND I WILL SEE YOU IN JULY.

20:16.883 --> 20:18.685
UH, EXCUSE ME,
YOUR HONOR?

20:18.718 --> 20:20.553
UH, I HAVE
ANOTHER WITNESS,

20:20.587 --> 20:24.291
BUT SHE'S ON A 72-HOUR
MENTAL-HEALTH HOLD.

20:24.324 --> 20:26.326
I NEED A REMOVAL ORDER.

20:27.560 --> 20:30.463
AND THERE'S NO ONE ELSE
IN THE BUILDING YOU COULD ASK?

20:30.497 --> 20:33.800
WELL, YOU'RE HERE, YOUR HONOR,
AND YOUR SCHEDULE JUST FREED UP.

20:35.568 --> 20:36.936
YES, IT DID.

20:44.811 --> 20:46.012
LIEUTENANT?

20:46.045 --> 20:47.847
AH, HARRIS' MOM
PAID FOR HIS BAIL,

20:47.880 --> 20:49.716
JUST LIKE
YOU'D HOPED SHE WOULD.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.884
HE LEFT MEN'S CENTRAL
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

20:51.918 --> 20:54.454
HE GOT ABOUT 10 FEET
FROM THE FRONT DOOR

20:54.487 --> 20:56.923
BEFORE WE RE-ARRESTED HIM

20:56.956 --> 20:58.725
FOR RAPING NATALIE GILBERT
LAST YEAR.

20:58.758 --> 21:01.394
HE'S SET UP IN INTERVIEW 1,
BUT HE'S ALREADY INVOKED, CHIEF.

21:01.428 --> 21:04.731
CHIEF, WE GOT NATALIE GILBERT
IN YOUR CONFERENCE ROOM.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.366
OKAY. HOW IS SHE?

21:06.399 --> 21:08.568
WELL, SHE KNOWS HER REAL NAME.
AT LEAST THAT'S A START.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.503
OKAY,
I'LL GO TALK TO HER FIRST.
NO.

21:11.538 --> 21:12.572
EXCUSE ME?

21:12.605 --> 21:14.441
NATALIE GILBERT
IS A VICTIM.

21:14.474 --> 21:16.443
NO, SHE'S NOT.
SHE'S A WITNESS.

21:16.476 --> 21:18.077
WE ARE NOT TRYING GEORGE HARRIS
FOR HER RAPE.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.313
WE COULD ADD TO THE CHARGES.
ARE YOU TELLING ME --

21:20.347 --> 21:22.349
SHE'S A MANIC DEPRESSIVE.
WAIT A MINUTE!

21:22.382 --> 21:23.550
NO, YOU WAIT A MINUTE!

21:23.583 --> 21:24.917
I INTEND TO WIN
THIS CASE,

21:24.951 --> 21:26.686
AND LET ME BE CLEAR
ABOUT THIS.

21:26.719 --> 21:28.621
IT IS MY CASE.

21:28.655 --> 21:31.691
YOU WANTED THE SUSPECT FREE.
HE'S HERE.

21:31.724 --> 21:33.960
I CAN'T TALK TO HIM.
YOU CAN.

21:33.993 --> 21:36.529
BUT THIS WITNESS --
SHE'S MINE.

21:36.563 --> 21:39.866
Raydor: CHIEF JOHNSON,
WITH MR. HARRIS UNDER ARREST,

21:39.899 --> 21:41.501
MR. STROH
WILL BE HERE SHORTLY.

21:41.534 --> 21:43.336
YOU WON'T HAVE MUCH TIME
TO SPEAK WITH THE SUSPECT.

21:43.370 --> 21:44.371
EXCUSE ME.

21:44.404 --> 21:46.038
OKAY, LOOK.

21:46.072 --> 21:48.341
YOU CAN'T INTERVIEW NATALIE
BY YOURSELF.

21:48.375 --> 21:50.743
YOU NEED A WITNESS
FOR WHEN YOU GO BACK TO COURT.

21:53.446 --> 21:56.983
I'LL TAKE DETECTIVE GABRIEL
AND LIEUTENANT TAO.

21:57.016 --> 22:00.487
THEY'RE TERRIFIC
ON THE STAND.

22:00.520 --> 22:03.923
OH, UH, THANK YOU.

22:03.956 --> 22:06.593
I, UH --
I LEARNED FROM THE BEST.

22:08.528 --> 22:10.730
YOU HEARD THE CAPTAIN.
STROH'S ON HIS WAY HERE.

22:10.763 --> 22:13.099
THAT YOUNG LADY INDICATES
THAT SHE CAN IDENTIFY HIM...

22:13.132 --> 22:14.133
YOU GOT IT.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.968
THANK YOU.

22:18.170 --> 22:21.408
Harris: YOU LET ME OUT OF JAIL
JUST TO ARREST ME?

22:21.441 --> 22:23.876
WELL, THEN YOU NEED TO GIVE
MY MOM BACK

22:23.910 --> 22:25.678
HER $2,500 BOND,
BECAUSE...

22:25.712 --> 22:26.946
THIS IS HARASSMENT.

22:26.979 --> 22:28.381
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

22:28.415 --> 22:30.417
MR. HARRIS, WE'RE NOT HERE
TO QUESTION YOU,

22:30.450 --> 22:34.020
JUST TO MAKE YOU AWARE OF
NEW CHARGES BROUGHT AGAINST YOU.

22:34.053 --> 22:37.457
YOU MIGHT RECOGNIZE THIS WOMAN,
NATALIE GILBERT.

22:37.490 --> 22:38.858
OF COURSE,
SHE LOOKS A LITTLE DIFFERENT

22:38.891 --> 22:40.059
THAN THE FIRST TIME
YOU MET HER.

22:40.092 --> 22:42.462
THIS PHOTO WAS TAKEN
AFTER YOU RAPED HER.

22:42.495 --> 22:44.731
LAST YEAR, YOU AND YOUR PARTNER
DRUGGED NATALIE,

22:44.764 --> 22:47.099
TOOK HER TO A MOTEL ROOM,
AND HAD YOUR WAY WITH HER.

22:47.133 --> 22:48.901
THAT CASE WAS DROPPED.

22:48.935 --> 22:51.070
DON'T SPEAK UNLESS
YOU'RE REVOKING YOUR
RIGHT TO COUNSEL, SIR.

22:51.103 --> 22:54.674
THAT CASE WAS DROPPED
BECAUSE NATALIE WENT MISSING.

22:55.775 --> 22:57.109
Sanchez:
BUT SHE'S BACK.

22:57.143 --> 22:58.711
WE FOUND HER.

22:58.745 --> 23:01.981
IN FACT, SHE'S HERE RIGHT NOW,
WITH D.D.A. BALDWIN.

23:02.014 --> 23:04.417
WANT TO KNOW
WHAT SHE'S SAYING?

23:05.818 --> 23:07.487
Natalie:
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

23:07.520 --> 23:09.989
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO THINK
ABOUT IT.

23:10.022 --> 23:13.025
I SPEND A LOT OF TIME
TRYING NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT.

23:13.059 --> 23:15.027
I UNDERSTAND, NATALIE.

23:15.061 --> 23:17.464
I WOULD FEEL THE SAME WAY.

23:17.497 --> 23:19.632
BUT THE MAN WHO DID
THIS TERRIBLE THING TO YOU

23:19.666 --> 23:21.033
HAS DONE IT
TO SOMEONE ELSE.

23:21.067 --> 23:23.670
AND THIS TIME,
HE KILLED HER.

23:26.806 --> 23:29.909
SO, I'M LUCKY
I ONLY LOST MY MIND.

23:31.511 --> 23:32.612
IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN?

23:32.645 --> 23:34.581
Brenda:
THINGS GOT OUT OF HAND.

23:34.614 --> 23:36.616
THESE THINGS HAPPEN.

23:36.649 --> 23:38.718
A PRETTY GIRL
DROPS IN YOUR CAB...

23:38.751 --> 23:39.786
FEELING NO PAIN.

23:39.819 --> 23:41.120
UP FOR ANYTHING.

23:41.153 --> 23:44.090
YOU ONLY WANTED A LITTLE FUN.
WE GET IT.

23:44.123 --> 23:46.158
MAYBE YOU THOUGHT SHE AGREED
TO EVERYTHING IN ADVANCE,

23:46.192 --> 23:48.194
BECAUSE WE KNOW YOU'RE NOT
THE ONE WHO DRUGGED HER.

23:49.862 --> 23:51.230
AND THAT'S
THE REAL CRIME HERE...

23:51.263 --> 23:53.065
BECAUSE THE NEXT TIME

23:53.099 --> 23:57.570
YOUR PARTNER FOUND YOU A GIRL
FOR YOU, GWENNYTH ADLER,

23:57.604 --> 24:00.473
HE SCREWED UP
AND OVERDOSED HER.

24:00.507 --> 24:01.708
THAT'S MURDER.

24:03.209 --> 24:04.944
YOU REALLY WANT TO BE
ON THE HOOK FOR THAT?

24:04.977 --> 24:09.115
NOW WE HAVE THIS NEW WITNESS
WHO CAN EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.

24:09.148 --> 24:11.618
I DON'T REMEMBER
THE BAR WHERE I WAS.

24:11.651 --> 24:15.622
I DON'T REMEMBER
HOW I GOT TO...

24:24.797 --> 24:28.134
...THAT FILTHY MOTEL ROOM

24:28.167 --> 24:30.069
WITH...

24:30.102 --> 24:31.571
WITH SOMEONE ON TOP OF ME.

24:32.939 --> 24:35.942
AND THERE WAS
A SECOND MAN.

24:37.109 --> 24:39.245
SO, BOTH OF THEM...

24:39.278 --> 24:41.714
BOTH OF THEM...

24:43.015 --> 24:45.818
Gabriel: NATALIE...

24:45.852 --> 24:48.588
I'M VERY SORRY ABOUT
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH.

24:48.621 --> 24:51.658
AND I CAN UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU WOULD WANT TO DISAPPEAR,

24:51.691 --> 24:54.293
BUT NOW THAT YOU ARE BACK,
WE CAN PUT THESE MEN AWAY.

24:54.326 --> 24:56.062
I DID NOT DISAPPEAR.

24:56.095 --> 25:00.166
THE PROSECUTOR FREAKED OUT
WHEN HE FOUND OUT I WAS BIPOLAR.

25:00.199 --> 25:03.870
HE SAID WHEN THE JURY HEARD
I WAS TAKING KLONOPIN,

25:03.903 --> 25:05.972
THEY MIGHT NOT
BELIEVE ME.

25:06.005 --> 25:08.307
EXCUSE ME, NATALIE. DID YOU SAY
YOU WERE TAKING KLONOPIN?

25:08.340 --> 25:10.142
AND I WAS TOTALLY
MANAGING.

25:11.210 --> 25:14.847
BUT, YOU KNOW,
AFTER THAT NIGHT, I...

25:14.881 --> 25:16.916
LOST MY JOB

25:16.949 --> 25:18.751
AND THEN
MY HEALTH INSURANCE.

25:18.785 --> 25:22.889
AND THEN WITHOUT MY MEDICINE,
I DON'T, UM...

25:26.926 --> 25:28.928
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT.

25:31.263 --> 25:33.532
THAT'S NOT DISAPPEARING.

25:36.102 --> 25:38.104
THAT'S HAVING YOUR LIFE
DESTROYED.

25:39.238 --> 25:41.107
AND NOW
YOU WANT TO DO IT AGAIN.

25:41.140 --> 25:42.575
I DON'T.

25:42.609 --> 25:45.344
YOUR CASE WAS MISHANDLED,
NATALIE.

25:45.377 --> 25:48.080
THERE'S NO EXCUSE
FOR THAT.

25:48.114 --> 25:49.248
BUT WE CAN MAKE IT RIGHT.

25:49.281 --> 25:51.618
HOW
I'M STILL BIPOLAR, OKAY?

25:51.651 --> 25:54.120
BUT NOW I'M HOMELESS,
AND I'M BROKE.

25:54.153 --> 25:56.188
DOES THAT IMPROVE
MY CREDIBILITY?

25:56.222 --> 25:58.791
THE STATE SETS ASIDE MONEY
FOR WITNESS ASSISTANCE.

25:58.825 --> 26:01.327
WE CAN HELP YOU
GET BACK ON YOUR FEET.

26:01.360 --> 26:03.329
I CAN'T DO IT. I CAN'T
GO THROUGH IT AGAIN. I WON'T!

26:03.362 --> 26:05.865
YOU WON'T GO TO COURT
AS A VICTIM.

26:05.898 --> 26:07.900
YOU'LL GO AS A WITNESS.

26:07.934 --> 26:09.201
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO

26:09.235 --> 26:12.304
IS SAY THAT YOU HAD SEX
WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT.

26:12.338 --> 26:15.207
THE DNA RESULTS
WILL TIE YOUR CASE WITH MINE

26:15.241 --> 26:19.178
AND PUT THE MAN AWAY
WHO HURT YOU SO BADLY.

26:19.211 --> 26:22.148
NOT JUST ONE OF THEM.

26:22.181 --> 26:23.950
WE COULD GET BOTH OF THEM,
NATALIE,

26:23.983 --> 26:26.886
IF YOU JUST WANT TO LOOK AT SOME
PICTURES, MAYBE SEE SOME FACES.

26:26.919 --> 26:28.087
THEY MAY JOG YOUR MEMORY.

26:28.120 --> 26:29.889
SHE DOESN'T NEED TO IDENTIFY
ANYONE.

26:29.922 --> 26:32.158
WE HAVE A DNA MATCH
TO OUR SUSPECT.

26:32.191 --> 26:34.961
WHO DO YOU WANT HER
TO POINT OUT, DETECTIVE?

26:34.994 --> 26:35.962
Harris: MY LAWYER.

26:35.995 --> 26:37.630
I WANT MY LAWYER.

26:37.664 --> 26:40.166
I'M NOT SAYING ANOTHER WORD
TO YOU PEOPLE WITHOUT STROH.

26:40.199 --> 26:41.634
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY
A WORD.

26:41.668 --> 26:43.169
YOUR DNA PUTS YOU
AT BOTH CRIME SCENES.

26:43.202 --> 26:45.705
AND WITH THIS NEW WITNESS, WE
HAVE MORE THAN ENOUGH EVIDENCE

26:45.738 --> 26:48.107
TO CONVICT YOU
OF RAPE AND MURDER.

26:49.175 --> 26:51.644
LOOK, MR. HARRIS.

26:51.678 --> 26:53.112
BEFORE YOUR ATTORNEY
GETS HERE,

26:53.145 --> 26:56.248
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT THE D.A.
IS PREPARED TO OFFER YOU

26:56.282 --> 26:58.050
A GREATLY REDUCED SENTENCE

26:58.084 --> 27:01.253
IN EXCHANGE FOR THE NAME OF THE
PERSON WHO DRUGGED THOSE WOMEN.

27:03.389 --> 27:05.658
BUT IF YOU
REFUSE TO COOPERATE,

27:05.692 --> 27:08.394
YOU'LL BE TAKING THE FALL --
ALL BY YOURSELF.

27:08.427 --> 27:11.664
IN PRISON,
RAPE GOES BOTH WAYS.

27:11.698 --> 27:13.933
AND STROH WALKS OUT OF HERE
A FREE MAN.

27:13.966 --> 27:15.868
BUT YOU'D BETTER HURRY UP
AND MAKE YOUR DECISION,

27:15.902 --> 27:17.103
BECAUSE
THE METER IS RUNNING.

27:19.772 --> 27:20.773
I'M SORRY.

27:20.807 --> 27:21.407
OKAY.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.977
UH...

27:29.148 --> 27:30.850
CHIEF JOHNSON.

27:30.883 --> 27:32.819
I HOPE YOU WEREN'T QUESTIONING
MY CLIENT WITHOUT ME.

27:32.852 --> 27:34.453
OF COURSE NOT.

27:34.486 --> 27:37.456
JUST ADVISING MR. HARRIS OF THE
NEW CHARGES BROUGHT AGAINST HIM.

27:37.489 --> 27:39.358
OR SHOULD I SAY
THE OLD CHARGES?

27:39.391 --> 27:41.694
WE FOUND THE VICTIM
IN HIS FIRST RAPE.

27:41.728 --> 27:43.229
OH, REALLY?

27:43.262 --> 27:45.932
TELL ME, HOW IS
NATALIE GILBERT FEELING?

27:45.965 --> 27:47.199
SHE BACK ON HER MEDS?

27:47.233 --> 27:49.335
SHE'LL BE READY FOR COURT
IN JULY.

27:50.369 --> 27:53.472
SO, THAT'S WHY
YOU PROVOKED A MISTRIAL.

27:53.505 --> 27:55.074
I HATE TO SAY THIS, CHIEF,

27:55.107 --> 27:57.944
BUT YOU ARE THE WORST LOSER
I HAVE EVER MET.

27:57.977 --> 28:00.980
AND YOU ARE A LOSER.

28:01.013 --> 28:02.448
HELLO, GUYS.

28:02.481 --> 28:05.151
ALWAYS A PLEASURE.

28:07.086 --> 28:09.756
HARRIS DIDN'T DRUG
THOSE WOMEN.

28:09.789 --> 28:11.958
HE HAD A PARTNER.

28:11.991 --> 28:13.359
AND I INTEND TO FIND HIM.

28:15.327 --> 28:17.196
NOT WITH THIS.

28:21.467 --> 28:24.470
I WAS WONDERING HOW YOU WERE
ABLE TO TRACK MY CLIENT

28:24.503 --> 28:27.039
TO THE RESTAURANT
WHERE YOU ARRESTED HIM.

28:27.073 --> 28:28.374
AND THEN TODAY, IN COURT,

28:28.407 --> 28:30.476
WHEN YOU ACCUSED ME
OF BEING HIS PARTNER,

28:30.509 --> 28:32.244
I FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT.

28:32.278 --> 28:35.014
YOU HADN'T BEEN FOLLOWING HIM.
YOU'D BEEN FOLLOWING ME.

28:37.249 --> 28:38.384
ARROGANT...

28:40.419 --> 28:42.889
...CONSIDERING YOU JUST SETTLED
A FEDERAL LAWSUIT

28:42.922 --> 28:44.824
IN WHICH I SUED YOU
FOR HARASSMENT.

28:46.993 --> 28:49.195
YOU GUYS MAY THINK
SHE WALKS ON WATER,

28:49.228 --> 28:52.965
BUT YOU'RE FOLLOWING HER
ACROSS SOME VERY THIN ICE.

28:54.233 --> 28:56.135
VERY, VERY THIN.

29:07.546 --> 29:08.981
Tao: CHIEF.

29:09.015 --> 29:10.482
I THINK I KNOW
WHY NATALIE GILBERT

29:10.516 --> 29:12.251
WOKE UP EARLY
DURING HER RAPE

29:12.284 --> 29:14.520
AND WHY GWENNYTH ADLER
DIDN'T WAKE UP AT ALL.

29:14.553 --> 29:16.355
UH, I'M LISTENING.

29:16.388 --> 29:18.958
NATALIE WAS TAKING KLONOPIN,
A BENZODIAZEPINE.

29:18.991 --> 29:21.527
IT CREATES AN ENZYME
THAT BLOCKS

29:21.560 --> 29:24.096
THE ROHYPNOL THE ASSAILANTS USED
TO KNOCK HER OUT.

29:24.130 --> 29:26.098
THE RESULT --
SHE WOKE UP TOO QUICKLY.

29:26.132 --> 29:27.499
SO HARRIS AND HIS PARTNER

29:27.533 --> 29:30.169
UPPED THE DOSE OF ROHYPNOL
ON THE NEXT VICTIM

29:30.202 --> 29:31.570
TO MAKE SURE
THAT SHE STAYED SEDATED.

29:31.603 --> 29:34.006
AND THAT'S
HOW THEY KILLED HER, YEAH.

29:34.040 --> 29:35.274
OKAY.

29:35.307 --> 29:37.977
DETECTIVE, UM,
WHERE'S NATALIE GONE?

29:38.010 --> 29:41.848
UH, WELL, D.D.A. BALDWIN
WANTS HER IN PROTECTIVE CUSTODY.

29:41.881 --> 29:44.216
SO PROVENZA'S
PROCESSING HER NOW.

29:44.250 --> 29:45.484
BUT STROH'S
IN THE BUILDING.

29:45.517 --> 29:46.886
ALL I NEED
IS FOR HER TO LOOK AT HIM.

29:46.919 --> 29:49.255
CHIEF, NATALIE REFUSES.

29:50.556 --> 29:53.525
UH, WAS SHE ABLE TO PICK STROH'S
PICTURE OUT OF A SIX

29:53.559 --> 29:56.228
BALDWIN WOULDN'T
LET ME SHOW 'EM TO HER. I TRIED.

29:56.262 --> 29:57.997
DETECTIVE, THAT'S
WHY I HAD YOU IN THE ROOM,

29:58.030 --> 29:59.431
SO YOU COULD GUIDE
THE VICTIM!

29:59.465 --> 30:01.467
CHIEF, WE'VE ENDED UP HAVING
A REALLY GOOD DAY SO FAR.

30:01.500 --> 30:04.236
THIS IS THE THANKS I GET FOR
GETTING BALDWIN FOUR MORE WEEKS?

30:04.270 --> 30:07.106
SHE'S WANTS TO USE NATALIE TO
GET A CONVICTION AGAINST HARRIS.

30:07.139 --> 30:10.342
AND WHEN SHE DOES,
FOR A MORE LENIENT SENTENCE,

30:10.376 --> 30:12.444
HE MAY VERY WELL
GIVE UP HIS PARTNER.

30:12.478 --> 30:15.381
CHIEF, I-IT'S A "BIRD
IN THE HAND" TYPE SITUATION.

30:15.414 --> 30:16.983
WE TAKE
THE RAPE CONVICTION,

30:17.016 --> 30:18.851
AND WE BEAT HIM OVER THE HEAD
WITH IT.

30:18.885 --> 30:20.352
IT DOES NOT GET ME STROH.

30:20.386 --> 30:23.455
BALDWIN ISN'T GOING TO BLOW
HER CASE OVER  --

30:23.489 --> 30:25.858
UNSUBSTANTIATED
ACCUSATIONS.

30:25.892 --> 30:27.393
CHIEF.

30:27.426 --> 30:29.996
I'M TRYING TO FIND A PLACE
TO PARK NATALIE GILBERT,

30:30.029 --> 30:32.932
BUT IT'S TURNING OUT TO BE
A LOT TOUGHER THAN IT SHOULD.

30:32.965 --> 30:35.935
SHE'S HOMELESS.
SHE HAS NO PLACE TO GO.

30:35.968 --> 30:40.072
AND, UH, I THINK PUTTING HER
BACK INTO A MOTEL ROOM

30:40.106 --> 30:41.974
MIGHT TURN OUT TO BE
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.

30:42.008 --> 30:44.043
WE CAN'T JUST
LET HER WALK OUT OF HERE.

30:46.145 --> 30:47.646
GOODNESS, NO.

30:47.679 --> 30:50.983
CAPTAIN, THERE'S
THE JOHNSON RULE TO CONSIDER.

30:51.017 --> 30:53.085
WE CAN'T LET PEOPLE
LEAVE THE BUILDING

30:53.119 --> 30:55.321
IF THEY'RE GONNA BE FACING
HOSTILE SITUATIONS.

30:55.354 --> 30:57.623
NATALIE NEEDS SOME PROTECTION.
DON'T YOU AGREE?

31:00.626 --> 31:02.461
I WANT TO TELL YOU --

31:02.494 --> 31:06.632
I WANT TO SAY H-HOW SORRY I AM
ABOUT THAT OTHER WOMAN.

31:06.665 --> 31:08.300
I JUST --

31:08.334 --> 31:11.103
I CAN'T DO ANY MORE
THAN I ALREADY HAVE.

31:11.137 --> 31:13.039
THAT'S OKAY.

31:14.306 --> 31:15.641
I'M ONLY WORRIED

31:15.674 --> 31:17.409
THAT ONE OF YOUR ATTACKERS
IS STILL OUT THERE.

31:17.443 --> 31:20.179
YOU GOT A GOOD LOOK AT HIM.
WE HAVE HIS DNA.

31:20.212 --> 31:21.547
AND HE KNOWS ALL THAT.

31:21.580 --> 31:23.182
Fritz: BRENDA?
FRITZI!

31:23.215 --> 31:25.417
WE HAVE A GUEST.
YOU REMEMBER NATALIE?

31:25.451 --> 31:27.586
SURE.
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

31:27.619 --> 31:31.057
UH, I'M GOING TO STEAL BRENDA
FOR A SECOND, NATALIE,

31:31.090 --> 31:32.291
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

31:32.324 --> 31:35.127
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
JUST ONE SECOND.

31:36.462 --> 31:38.664
ANYWAY, YOU'RE PERFECTLY SAFE
HERE TONIGHT.

31:38.697 --> 31:41.233
I'M ONLY CONCERNED
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS LATER...

31:41.267 --> 31:43.069
WHEN YOU'RE OUT ON YOUR OWN
SOMEWHERE

31:43.102 --> 31:44.470
AND THE L.A.P.D.
IS NOT AROUND.

31:44.503 --> 31:47.173
OF COURSE, IF YOU COULD
IDENTIFY THE GUY,

31:47.206 --> 31:48.540
WE COULD PICK HIM UP,

31:48.574 --> 31:51.443
END THIS ONGOING THREAT
AGAINST YOUR LIFE.

31:51.477 --> 31:55.714
BUT AS IT STANDS NOW,
HE'S GONNA COME AFTER YOU AGAIN.

31:55.747 --> 31:59.285
ONLY THIS TIME,
HE'LL TRY TO SILENCE YOU.

32:01.053 --> 32:05.524
KEEP YOU FROM EVER TELLING US
WHAT YOU DON'T REMEMBER.

32:05.557 --> 32:07.126
BRENDA?

32:07.159 --> 32:08.260
YES?

32:11.063 --> 32:12.498
EXCUSE ME.

32:12.531 --> 32:15.101
CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING ELSE?
MORE BREAD

32:22.008 --> 32:23.242
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

32:23.275 --> 32:24.576
SHE'S HOMELESS, FRITZ.

32:24.610 --> 32:26.412
IS SHE STAYING THE NIGHT?

32:26.445 --> 32:28.480
WELL, I WAS HOPING THAT SHE'D
END UP TAKING ME TO A BAR.

32:28.514 --> 32:29.748
DO YOU REALLY THINK
IT'S FAIR

32:29.781 --> 32:31.750
TO DRAG THAT POOR GIRL
THROUGH HER RAPE AGAIN

32:31.783 --> 32:34.153
WHEN IT'S CLEAR SHE DOESN'T
WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT?

32:34.186 --> 32:35.621
DO YOU THINK IT'S FAIR

32:35.654 --> 32:37.589
THAT THE GUY WHO DID THAT TO HER
IS RUNNING AROUND FREE?

32:37.623 --> 32:39.625
I'M TRYING TO FIND HIM
AND PUT HIM IN PRISON.

32:39.658 --> 32:41.693
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
YOU ARE TRYING TO NAIL STROH.

32:41.727 --> 32:43.195
IT'S THE SAME THING.
IS IT?

32:43.229 --> 32:44.696
DID YOUR LITTLE GPS DEVICE
SHOW STROH

32:44.730 --> 32:46.999
AT EITHER OF THE MOTELS WHERE
YOUR TWO VICTIMS WERE RAPED?

32:47.033 --> 32:49.668
DID IT SHOW HIM AT THE BAR
WHERE YOUR SECOND VICTIM
WAS THE NIGHT SHE DIED?

32:49.701 --> 32:51.270
HARRIS HAS A CAB.

32:51.303 --> 32:53.039
AND HE ASKED FOR TWO KEYS
TO THAT MOTEL ROOM

32:53.072 --> 32:54.406
THE NIGHT
HE RAPED GWENNYTH.

32:54.440 --> 32:55.741
AND HARRIS
DIDN'T DRUG HER.

32:55.774 --> 32:57.476
WELL, HOW DO YOU KNOW FOR SURE
STROH DID?

32:57.509 --> 33:00.712
HE'S USING YOUR FASCINATION
WITH HIM TO GET HIS CLIENT OFF.

33:00.746 --> 33:02.281
YOU WANT HARRIS
TO WALK?

33:02.314 --> 33:04.250
I WANT 'EM BOTH --
HARRIS AND STROH.

33:04.283 --> 33:06.252
I WON'T GIVE UP ONE
TO GET THE OTHER.

33:06.285 --> 33:07.386
AND BALDWIN WILL.

33:07.419 --> 33:09.521
I -- I REMEMBER SOMETHING.

33:11.257 --> 33:12.558
STELLA'S NIGHTCLUB.

33:12.591 --> 33:14.526
THAT'S WHAT IT WAS CALLED.

33:14.560 --> 33:17.296
THAT'S WHERE I WENT.

33:22.634 --> 33:24.136
LIEUTENANTS.

33:24.170 --> 33:25.737
CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME
WHY I HAD TO LEARN

33:25.771 --> 33:27.773
THAT MR. HARRIS
WAS BEING REMOVED FROM HOLDING

33:27.806 --> 33:29.741
AND BROUGHT TO A NIGHT CLUB
FROM A VOICEMAIL?

33:29.775 --> 33:32.411
YOUR SECRETARY LEFT WORK EARLY?
JUST GUESSING.

33:32.444 --> 33:34.646
RELAX, COUNSELOR.
YOU'LL LOVE THIS PLACE.

33:34.680 --> 33:35.781
YEAH, IT'S LADIES' NIGHT.

33:37.183 --> 33:39.651
AS LONG AS I DON'T
HAVE TO TALK TO THEM.

33:44.490 --> 33:46.692
MR. STROH,
WELCOME TO STELLA'S.

33:46.725 --> 33:50.162
WE HAVE A TABLE WAITING FOR YOU.
JUST FOLLOW ME.

33:52.131 --> 33:53.532
WHERE'S MY CLIENT?

33:53.565 --> 33:55.701
UH, HE'LL BE HERE
IN A MINUTE.

34:00.706 --> 34:03.075
AH.
HERE WE ARE.

34:03.109 --> 34:04.543
UH, HAVE A SEAT,
COUNSELOR.

34:04.576 --> 34:06.278
UH, GABRIEL,
IF YOU DON'T MIND,

34:06.312 --> 34:08.814
WOULD YOU ASK THE BARTENDER TO
GET MR. STROH HERE A COCKTAIL?

34:08.847 --> 34:11.250
NONE FOR ME, THANKS.

34:11.283 --> 34:12.718
OH.

34:12.751 --> 34:16.755
WELL, UM, I COULD USE
ANOTHER CLUB SODA.

34:18.390 --> 34:19.458
WITH A LIME.

34:19.491 --> 34:22.128
MM-HMM.

34:25.331 --> 34:27.866
WHY DO I GET THE FEELING
YOU GUYS HAVE GONE...

34:27.899 --> 34:30.169
OUT OF YOUR WAY
TO SEE ME TONIGHT?

34:34.540 --> 34:35.841
THIS IS DEFINITELY
THE PLACE.

34:35.874 --> 34:37.343
Brenda: YOU SURE?

34:37.376 --> 34:39.445
YEAH,
I REMEMBER THAT GUY.

34:39.478 --> 34:41.513
WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER
ABOUT HIM?

34:41.547 --> 34:43.315
HE CARDED ME
AT THE DOOR.

34:43.349 --> 34:45.817
HE SAID HE COULDN'T BELIEVE
I WAS OVER 21.

34:45.851 --> 34:46.852
ANYTHING ELSE?

34:48.387 --> 34:49.655
I DON'T THINK SO.

34:52.424 --> 34:53.859
YOU'RE DOING GREAT,
NATALIE.

34:53.892 --> 34:55.361
JUST TAKE IT ALL IN.

34:55.394 --> 34:57.329
TELL US WHAT ELSE
YOU REMEMBER, OKAY?

34:57.363 --> 34:58.364
OKAY.

35:04.836 --> 35:06.372
IT'S OKAY.

35:06.405 --> 35:08.140
I'M RIGHT HERE WITH YOU.

35:26.458 --> 35:28.727
CHIEF JOHNSON.

35:28.760 --> 35:30.229
COME HERE OFTEN?

35:42.641 --> 35:43.842
THAT'S HIM.

35:43.875 --> 35:45.544
THAT'S HIM!
WHAT?

35:45.577 --> 35:47.346
THAT'S HIM!
THAT'S HIM!
HEY!

35:47.379 --> 35:48.647
GET OFF!
THAT'S HIM!!

35:48.680 --> 35:50.782
HEY!
THAT'S HIM!!

35:50.816 --> 35:53.385
GET UP!

35:53.419 --> 35:55.787
THAT'S HIM! THAT'S HIM!

35:59.525 --> 36:01.727
IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S ALL RIGHT.
HE'S UNDER ARREST NOW.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.895
YOU'RE OKAY.
YOU'RE SAFE.

36:03.929 --> 36:06.298
YOU'RE SAFE.
YOU'RE WITH US.

36:14.940 --> 36:17.276
SO...

36:17.309 --> 36:19.345
ASSUMING
THE DNA EVIDENCE CONFIRMS

36:19.378 --> 36:22.914
THAT YOU JUST FOUND
GEORGE HARRIS' MYSTERY PARTNER,

36:22.948 --> 36:25.284
I MIGHT BE WILLING
TO MAKE A DEAL

36:25.317 --> 36:27.719
IN EXCHANGE
FOR MY CLIENT'S COOPERATION.

36:27.753 --> 36:30.589
GREAT. WONDERFUL.

36:30.622 --> 36:33.859
DRUGGING WOMEN
TO HAVE SEX WITH THEM?

36:33.892 --> 36:36.895
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.

36:36.928 --> 36:38.497
IT'S JUST SO...

36:38.530 --> 36:39.498
UNSPORTING.

36:41.467 --> 36:43.502
NOT TO EVEN LET THEM EVEN HAVE
A FIGHTING CHANCE.

36:43.535 --> 36:45.304
SHOULD YOU TALK TO BALDWIN,
OR SHOULD I?

36:46.372 --> 36:48.206
I CAN'T MAKE DEALS
WITH MURDERERS.

36:49.275 --> 36:51.443
YOU JUST LOVE CALLING IT MURDER,
DON'T YOU?

36:52.678 --> 36:55.981
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL ATTEND TO THE GORY DETAILS.

36:56.014 --> 36:57.983
AND, UH...

36:58.016 --> 37:00.018
LIGHTEN UP.

37:00.051 --> 37:03.689
YOU GOT YOUR MAN,
AS ALWAYS.

37:04.823 --> 37:06.792
RIGHT?

37:25.811 --> 37:28.947
CHARLIE KNEW HOW TO TALK
TO WOMEN, YOU KNOW?

37:28.980 --> 37:32.484
WORKING IN A BAR,
HE MET ALL KINDS OF GIRLS.

37:34.052 --> 37:35.987
AND HE SAID THAT IF I JUST
DID WHAT HE SAID,

37:36.021 --> 37:37.556
HE'D HOOK ME UP, TOO.

37:37.589 --> 37:41.593
SO I GOT THE ROOM,
AND HE GOT THE BABE.

37:41.627 --> 37:46.998
BY THE TIME I SHOWED UP IN MY
CAB, HE HAD 'EM ALL LOOSENED UP.

37:47.032 --> 37:49.601
AFTER THAT, IT WAS JUST EASY.

37:49.635 --> 37:53.805
JUST LIKE HE SAID IT WOULD BE.

37:53.839 --> 37:55.907
EXCEPT FOR THAT --
THAT LAST GIRL.

37:59.110 --> 38:00.812
GWENNYTH.

38:03.349 --> 38:04.516
GWENNYTH.

38:04.550 --> 38:07.719
AFTER WE, UM...

38:07.753 --> 38:10.956
AFTER I...

38:10.989 --> 38:15.994
SHE STARTED MAKING THESE NOISES,
LIKE CHOKING.

38:16.027 --> 38:20.866
AND I SHOOK HER JUST A LITTLE,
JUST TO WAKE HER.

38:20.899 --> 38:22.634
AND THEN
SHE JUST STOPPED BREATHING.

38:22.668 --> 38:27.072
THEN CHARLIE SHOWED UP,
AND HE WAS PISSED.

38:27.105 --> 38:29.375
PUT TOO MUCH OF THAT STUFF
IN HER DRINK.

38:29.408 --> 38:31.410
HE DIDN'T WANT TO KILL HER.

38:31.443 --> 38:34.613
HE JUST -- OTHER GIRL
FROM THE TIME BEFORE, SHE, UM...

38:34.646 --> 38:36.615
SHE WOKE UP TOO SOON.

38:38.149 --> 38:41.453
NOW WRITE IT ALL DOWN
AND HOPE IT CHECKS OUT.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.362
CHIEF JOHNSON?

38:51.497 --> 38:53.098
NO APOLOGY?

38:56.768 --> 39:00.138
WELL, THEN,
I GUESS THIS IS GOODBYE...

39:00.171 --> 39:02.040
FINALLY.

39:09.415 --> 39:10.916
You'll see me again.

39:10.949 --> 39:13.419
You can count on it.

39:17.956 --> 39:19.758
Baldwin: BE RIGHT BACK.

39:24.029 --> 39:26.131
DON'T SOFT-PEDAL THIS.

39:26.164 --> 39:27.766
I WANT IT SAID TO HER

39:27.799 --> 39:30.001
JUST THE WAY CHIEF POPE TOLD ME
IT WOULD BE DONE.

39:30.035 --> 39:32.504
UH, DON'T
SOFT

39:32.538 --> 39:35.941
I'M NOT UNGRATEFUL
FOR THE RESULTS WE ACHIEVED,

39:35.974 --> 39:38.610
BUT YOU BEHAVED TOWARD ME
WITH WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE

39:38.644 --> 39:41.112
A CONDESCENDING, DISMISSIVE,
AND SECRETIVE ATTITUDE.

39:41.146 --> 39:43.114
AND, WHETHER
YOU'RE AWARE OF IT OR NOT,

39:43.148 --> 39:45.050
YOU HARMED THE PROSECUTION
OF MY CASE.

39:45.083 --> 39:47.419
YOUR CASE?
THAT'S RIGHT. MY CASE.

39:48.854 --> 39:50.922
CAPTAIN?

39:59.998 --> 40:02.901
MAYBE WE SHOULD GO INTO
YOUR OFFICE FOR --

40:02.934 --> 40:04.169
NO. NO.
HERE'S FINE.

40:05.771 --> 40:08.139
CHIEF POPE
BELIEVES THAT --

40:08.173 --> 40:09.875
CHIEF POPE BELIEVES?

40:10.909 --> 40:12.177
OH, SORRY. GO ON.

40:12.210 --> 40:13.912
CHIEF POPE BELIEVES
THAT YOU SHOULD

40:13.945 --> 40:16.848
START BRINGING PROSECUTORS ON
EARLIER IN YOUR CASES.

40:16.882 --> 40:18.817
HE AND
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY AGREE

40:18.850 --> 40:20.586
THAT PROVOKING
A MISTRIAL --

40:20.619 --> 40:22.120
I DIDN'T PROVOKE
A MISTRIAL.

40:22.153 --> 40:24.890
I ANSWERED THE QUESTIONS
AS TRUTHFULLY AS I COULD,

40:24.923 --> 40:27.225
IN KEEPING WITH THE OATH
I TOOK ON THE STAND.

40:27.258 --> 40:30.228
I KNOW.
I UNDERSTAND.

40:30.261 --> 40:34.800
THE CHIEF OF POLICE WOULD LIKE
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE

40:34.833 --> 40:37.135
TO HAVE A MORE OPEN ACCESS
TO MAJOR CRIMES.

40:38.570 --> 40:40.539
OKAY. WE'LL TALK.

40:40.572 --> 40:41.840
ANYTHING ELSE?

40:43.141 --> 40:45.844
YOU ARE NO LONGER TO INVESTIGATE
PHILLIP STROH,

40:45.877 --> 40:49.915
MONITOR HIS MOVEMENTS,
OR IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM

40:49.948 --> 40:52.818
INTERFERE WITH THE CONDUCT
OF HIS ACTIVITIES

40:52.851 --> 40:54.853
EITHER PERSONAL OR LEGAL,

40:54.886 --> 40:56.722
WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL
OF CHIEF POPE.

40:58.023 --> 40:59.691
GOT IT.

40:59.725 --> 41:01.993
THANK YOU, SHARON.

41:03.995 --> 41:05.130
CHIEF?

41:05.163 --> 41:07.599
I'M SORRY ABOUT THIS.

41:07.633 --> 41:10.001
I'M SPEAKING TO YOU NOW
NOT ONLY

41:10.035 --> 41:12.838
AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE
PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS BUREAU,

41:12.871 --> 41:14.773
BUT ALSO AS A COLLEAGUE
AND A FRIEND.

41:14.806 --> 41:16.074
IF I WERE YOU,

41:16.107 --> 41:18.209
I WOULD TAKE THESE ORDERS
VERY SERIOUSLY.

41:20.579 --> 41:22.180
TRUST ME --

41:22.213 --> 41:23.715
I AM.
