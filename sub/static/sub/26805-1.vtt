WEBVTT

00:26.402 --> 00:27.653
Okay.

00:27.945 --> 00:32.073
Everybody, eyes up here.
It's time to get started.

00:32.366 --> 00:35.327
So, I was thinking this morning.

00:35.619 --> 00:40.583
I was thinking about what it
was like being your age,

00:40.875 --> 00:46.922
how I'd come to worship like
I was ticking off a to-do list.

00:47.214 --> 00:48.799
I didn't get it like I do now,

00:49.091 --> 00:54.388
and I thought, "Well, maybe I
should tell you guys a secret."

00:54.680 --> 00:57.683
Do you know what we're
trying to do every Sunday

00:57.975 --> 01:01.687
in church as adults?

01:01.979 --> 01:07.610
We're trying to undo the things
we did when we were your age.

01:10.654 --> 01:14.033
Think about it.
You're our future,

01:14.325 --> 01:15.743
and you are at an age

01:16.035 --> 01:18.662
where you are especially
vulnerable to evil.

01:21.457 --> 01:24.085
Now when I say,
"Evil," I mean evil.

01:27.963 --> 01:29.965
And you won't see it now.

01:30.257 --> 01:32.426
You won't see it tomorrow.

01:32.718 --> 01:37.431
But what feels like fun
is actually the enemy,

01:37.723 --> 01:45.356
and that enemy is closing
the noose around your neck.

01:45.648 --> 01:49.443
Bruce?!
Is anyone home?!

01:54.115 --> 01:56.909
While you experiment
and play with that yoke

01:57.201 --> 01:58.702
like it's a toy and you think,

01:58.994 --> 02:00.996
"Oh, just this once, just...

02:01.288 --> 02:04.333
just a little longer,"
click.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.252

Cameron, what the fuck?

06:46.031 --> 06:47.032
Jamie.

06:47.324 --> 06:48.325
What the fuck?

06:54.248 --> 06:56.375
I can't fucking believe this.

06:56.667 --> 06:59.336
I'm sorry.

06:59.628 --> 07:01.463
It's just so messed up!

07:43.338 --> 07:44.882
And by the time
I was in my 30s,

07:45.174 --> 07:47.259
I didn't believe in God
at all.

07:47.551 --> 07:49.511
You know what, George?
It wasn't until...

07:49.803 --> 07:51.805
The Scripture
we're referencing

07:52.097 --> 07:55.809
is Matthew 10:11,

07:56.101 --> 08:00.481
and if you go
to Matthew 10:11,

08:00.772 --> 08:02.983
you'll probably know
this one.

08:03.275 --> 08:06.195
Uh, whatever town
or villa...

08:13.494 --> 08:14.661
Hey.

08:14.953 --> 08:17.164
Hello.

08:17.456 --> 08:19.750
I'm looking
for Reverend Rick.

08:20.042 --> 08:23.837
He's still in a sermon.
I'll take you to him.

08:41.230 --> 08:43.440
I'm Cameron.

09:30.195 --> 09:33.240
All right, guys. Time's up.
See you at dinner.

09:53.552 --> 09:55.929
Erin's a big Vikings fan,
aren't you?

09:56.221 --> 09:57.764
Guilty as charged.

09:58.056 --> 10:01.393
But don't worry.
You'll get decorating privileges soon.

10:03.228 --> 10:05.814
You have to earn certain
rights at God's Promise.

10:06.106 --> 10:09.443
I swear it's not that bad...
just decorating and mail.

10:09.735 --> 10:12.029
Most disciples get there
in a few weeks.

10:12.321 --> 10:13.947
It's all spelled out
in the contract.

10:16.366 --> 10:20.245
Maybe in the meantime,
you'll become a Vikings fan.

10:20.537 --> 10:23.040
Who's your favorite team?
I-I don't have one.

10:23.332 --> 10:25.083
I'm impressed.

10:25.375 --> 10:27.044
It's pretty rare
that I don't manage to...

10:27.336 --> 10:31.340
Oh, spoke too soon.

10:31.632 --> 10:35.927
I'm guessing The Breeders aren't
singing in praise of the Lord.

10:37.054 --> 10:38.972
Where did you get this?

10:39.264 --> 10:40.849
Columbia House.

10:44.603 --> 10:46.647
I'm done here.

10:46.938 --> 10:49.107
Take a look at the contract?

10:49.399 --> 10:51.360
Yeah.

10:51.652 --> 10:54.655
All that's left is your
signature, and we're good to go.

10:59.576 --> 11:02.204
I think you're going to do
really well here, Cammie.

11:15.384 --> 11:18.929
Perfect. Now you're officially
a disciple of God's Promise.

11:19.221 --> 11:20.347
Welcome.

11:20.639 --> 11:23.016
Whoo!

11:38.949 --> 11:41.410
Fuck.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.874
I want you to put on
your clothes and leave.

11:48.166 --> 11:50.335
No, you don't.
Yes, I do.

11:53.630 --> 11:56.883
No, you don't.

11:57.175 --> 11:59.803
This movie's weird.

12:00.095 --> 12:01.221
I want you to leave.

12:01.513 --> 12:03.515
You knew that was
going to happen.

12:03.807 --> 12:06.101
No, I didn't.

12:06.393 --> 12:09.146
I wouldn't know
what to do.

12:09.438 --> 12:11.064
You can start by putting

12:11.356 --> 12:14.067
the do-not-disturb sign
on the door.

12:14.359 --> 12:17.362
I really didn't know
it was going to happen.

12:17.654 --> 12:19.614
Yes, you did.

12:19.906 --> 12:21.950
No, I didn't.
Yes, you did.

12:25.620 --> 12:28.081
That part went smoothly.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.629
I'm not...

12:34.921 --> 12:36.548
taking off my robe.

12:36.840 --> 12:40.385
Well, everybody
draws the line somewhere.

12:46.850 --> 12:48.935
I don't usually...

12:53.565 --> 13:00.197
...feel this way.
It's blocking me.

13:00.489 --> 13:04.868
I don't know
if I've ever felt...

13:05.160 --> 13:07.954
this way before.

13:30.936 --> 13:32.896
Tell me when to stop.

13:57.379 --> 14:00.173
I think if your top priority
is to get better,

14:00.465 --> 14:01.943
that should also be
true of the people

14:01.967 --> 14:04.636
you surround yourself
with, you know?

14:04.928 --> 14:07.722
And you think you're
getting... better?

14:08.014 --> 14:09.140
Of course.

14:09.432 --> 14:11.726
I've been brought
closer to God,

14:12.018 --> 14:13.687
and I can feel
Him guiding me.

14:13.979 --> 14:16.106
Like, Helen's
a really good friend,

14:16.398 --> 14:18.567
and we're positive
influences on each other.

14:18.859 --> 14:21.653
That's her by the milk.

14:21.945 --> 14:24.406
It's a shame she's so...
Hi!

14:26.533 --> 14:27.973
Well, she's kind
of butch, isn't she?

14:29.744 --> 14:31.472
I know that's a mean word,
but I mean it, like,

14:31.496 --> 14:34.332
factually, like,
not in a mean way.

14:34.624 --> 14:35.959
That girl's name
is Jane Fonda...

14:36.251 --> 14:38.169
like, her actual name.

14:40.130 --> 14:43.300
Either that or she's lying.

14:43.592 --> 14:44.968
She could be lying.

14:46.511 --> 14:48.763
Mark is really cool.

14:49.055 --> 14:51.558
Don't look now,
but he's at my 12:00.

14:53.018 --> 14:54.311
You looked.

14:54.603 --> 14:55.963
He has a really nice
singing voice,

14:56.187 --> 14:59.900
and, okay, you have to promise
not to tell anyone,

15:00.191 --> 15:03.445
but I have a really
big crush on him.

15:03.737 --> 15:05.906
My lips are sealed.

15:08.158 --> 15:12.537
Rick is such an inspiration.

15:12.829 --> 15:16.750
Do you know he used to struggle
with same-sex attractions?

15:17.042 --> 15:18.126
Really?

15:18.418 --> 15:20.058
Yeah, and he's been
in recovery for years,

15:20.086 --> 15:22.213
and now he and Bethany
are girlfriend and boyfriend.

15:22.505 --> 15:24.591
Yeah. How cute is that?

15:24.883 --> 15:27.969
I think they could
both do better.

15:28.261 --> 15:32.223
Totally.
Wait. What?

15:32.515 --> 15:34.351
Honey, what grade were
you starting at school?

15:34.643 --> 15:35.644
Um, 11th.

15:35.936 --> 15:38.229
Oh, great.
I think we have that one.

15:38.521 --> 15:41.149
Okay.

15:41.441 --> 15:44.986
Uh... ah.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.905
Here we go.

15:47.197 --> 15:48.907
Does this look right to you?

15:49.199 --> 15:50.367
Yes.

15:52.077 --> 15:54.204
I apologize
for the interruption,

15:54.496 --> 15:55.664
Ms. Kimballs-Ericson.

15:55.956 --> 15:59.167
I've come to meet
our new disciple.

16:01.795 --> 16:04.714
Welcome, Cameron.
I'm Dr. Lydia Marsh.

16:05.006 --> 16:06.925
I'm the director
of God's Promise.

16:07.217 --> 16:08.426
Hi.

16:08.718 --> 16:10.929
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

16:11.221 --> 16:13.101
I know the adjustment
can be difficult at first,

16:13.264 --> 16:15.704
but I have every faith you'll
find yourself at home here soon.

16:15.809 --> 16:17.569
In the meantime,
please don't hesitate to ask

16:17.644 --> 16:19.479
if you need anything.

16:19.771 --> 16:21.606
Thank you.

16:21.898 --> 16:24.985
You should consider yourself
amongst family, Cameron.

16:25.276 --> 16:27.362
You can call me "Cam."

16:27.654 --> 16:29.197
"Cameron" is already
a masculine name.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.700
To abbreviate as something
even less feminine

16:31.992 --> 16:34.494
only exacerbates
your gender confusion.

16:37.622 --> 16:39.457
Right.

16:39.749 --> 16:42.002
Glad we're
on the same page.

16:55.432 --> 16:57.142
I have told you

16:57.434 --> 16:58.935
to keep your hair

16:59.227 --> 17:02.022
out of your eyes.

17:02.313 --> 17:04.691
There's no hiding from God.

18:17.972 --> 18:20.558
Would you say that the tip
of the iceberg looks scary

18:20.850 --> 18:23.520
to the people on the boat?

18:23.812 --> 18:25.146
Yeah.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.899
It's all the people
on the ship want to focus on,

18:28.191 --> 18:32.028
but we know it's not
the real problem, is it?

18:32.320 --> 18:34.697
No.

18:42.205 --> 18:46.501
Um, the same can be said
for your same-sex attraction.

18:46.793 --> 18:50.296
The sin is so overwhelming

18:50.588 --> 18:53.341
that we become fixated on it,

18:53.633 --> 18:56.010
but the problems we
really need to deal with

18:56.302 --> 18:58.429
are below the surface.

18:58.721 --> 19:02.559
Your attractions are a symptom
of a larger problem.

19:02.851 --> 19:05.854
We're going to spend our time
together like detectives

19:06.146 --> 19:09.566
investigating what
in your past led you here,

19:09.858 --> 19:12.026
especially your relationship
with your parents.

19:12.318 --> 19:14.988
What relationship?

19:15.280 --> 19:19.033
They died a long time ago.

19:19.325 --> 19:20.994
I know we're throwing
a lot at you.

19:21.286 --> 19:23.538
How are you feeling?

19:23.830 --> 19:28.334
Good. Good. I'm good.
I-I...

19:28.626 --> 19:30.795
I've just never thought
of homosexuality like this.

19:31.087 --> 19:32.755
There's no such thing
as homosexuality.

19:33.047 --> 19:36.801
There's only the same struggle
with sin we all face.

19:37.093 --> 19:39.971
Would you let drug addicts
throw parades for themselves?

19:42.557 --> 19:46.102
No. No, you wouldn't.

19:46.394 --> 19:47.729
Sin is sin.

19:48.021 --> 19:51.232
Your struggle is with the sin
of same-sex attraction.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.164
The first step is for you
to stop thinking

19:53.359 --> 19:54.652
of yourself as a homosexual.

19:54.944 --> 19:57.113
But I don't think of myself
as a homosexual.

19:59.157 --> 20:01.201
I mean, I don't really think
of myself as anything.

20:01.492 --> 20:04.495
You should think of
yourself as a Christian.

20:04.787 --> 20:06.789
We're here to support you.

20:07.081 --> 20:11.127
Rick did the work, was able
to overcome his own illness,

20:11.419 --> 20:14.422
and I have no doubt that
you're capable of the same.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.424
I've been right where you are.

20:18.593 --> 20:21.054
I know how you feel.

20:34.984 --> 20:37.528
Is that your mom?

20:37.820 --> 20:40.990
She really looked like you.

20:43.493 --> 20:44.994
How's the iceberg coming?

20:45.286 --> 20:47.038
Good.

20:47.330 --> 20:48.331
Good, just slow.

20:51.292 --> 20:54.170
Oh, cool.

20:54.462 --> 20:57.799
I have gender confusion
'cause of sports, too.

20:58.091 --> 21:01.261
Wow.

21:01.552 --> 21:03.054
Cool.

21:03.346 --> 21:04.806
See you later.

21:20.530 --> 21:24.450
"Too much masculine
bonding with Dad over football."

21:24.742 --> 21:26.953
Right up the middle!

21:27.245 --> 21:28.413
Yeah!
Yeah!

21:28.705 --> 21:29.872
"Jessica's beauty,

21:30.164 --> 21:33.167
resulting in feelings
of feminine inadequacy."

21:33.459 --> 21:35.962
"Lack of physical
affection from my father."

21:40.800 --> 21:46.055
"Infatuation with soccer coach
at Holy Light Summer Camp."

21:46.347 --> 21:47.724
"Inappropriate obsession

21:48.016 --> 21:49.767
with Vicki Jones
from church choir."

21:50.059 --> 21:52.729
♪ This little light of mine ♪

21:53.021 --> 21:54.939
♪ I'm gonna let it shine ♪

21:55.231 --> 21:56.274
♪ This ♪

21:56.566 --> 21:58.126
"Unresolved sexual trauma

21:58.276 --> 22:00.611
when Orin Bursock
slapped my backside."

22:03.489 --> 22:06.993
"Too much bonding with Mom

22:09.579 --> 22:13.333
"Belief in winkte

22:24.927 --> 22:26.554
What are you doing?

22:26.846 --> 22:30.350
Oh, um, I'm sorry.
I was just...

22:30.641 --> 22:32.560
What?

22:32.852 --> 22:35.396
I was looking
at your iceberg.

22:35.688 --> 22:38.107
Everyone does it.

22:38.399 --> 22:40.068
You done yours yet?

22:40.360 --> 22:41.611
No, not yet.

22:41.903 --> 22:44.280
You run, right?
Yeah.

22:44.572 --> 22:46.908
Just talk about how positive
reinforcements for sports

22:47.200 --> 22:48.480
messed with your
gender identity.

22:48.659 --> 22:49.659
They love that shit.

22:51.537 --> 22:53.956
And how your parents gave you
too much physical affection

22:54.248 --> 22:55.625
or not enough
physical affection.

22:55.917 --> 22:59.170
Either way,
that's why you're gay.

22:59.462 --> 23:01.672
My parents are dead.

23:01.964 --> 23:04.759
That should probably
go in your iceberg.

23:07.345 --> 23:09.347
You grew up in a commune?

23:09.639 --> 23:11.599
Yeah.

23:11.891 --> 23:14.685
I didn't know hippies
were evangelical.

23:14.977 --> 23:18.106
They're not.
My mom's new husband is.

23:18.398 --> 23:21.734
One last question.
I was in a car accident.

23:22.026 --> 23:25.446
I was actually going to ask you
where you got your weed.

23:27.323 --> 23:28.825
I beg your pardon?

23:31.285 --> 23:33.663
I saw you and Adam
in the cellar.

23:38.167 --> 23:41.671
I grow it myself.
It's ditch weed.

23:41.963 --> 23:43.923
I already harvested,
but there are some stragglers

23:44.090 --> 23:46.175
Adam and I are going
to check out Thursday.

23:53.975 --> 23:57.645
You don't really seem like the
kind of person that'd be here.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.897
Why? 'Cause I'm
such a dick magnet?

24:02.150 --> 24:04.110
No, just...

24:04.402 --> 24:06.571
I didn't have a choice.

24:06.863 --> 24:09.240
Did you?

24:13.536 --> 24:16.205
I will not pray
for God to change me

24:16.497 --> 24:19.167
because God does not
make mistakes,

24:19.459 --> 24:23.671
and I am the one
who is tempted by sin.

24:23.963 --> 24:26.841
Change will come
through God

24:27.133 --> 24:28.468
but within me.
Me.

24:28.759 --> 24:31.429
I must be the change.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.851
I've always known
I didn't want to act

24:37.143 --> 24:39.020
on my same-sex attractions,

24:39.312 --> 24:43.858
so, in the past, I would
resort to... self-pleasure.

24:44.150 --> 24:46.068
Then when I learned
that that was a sin, also,

24:46.360 --> 24:48.321
I stopped,

24:48.613 --> 24:51.657
but it's like...
shouldn't it be okay

24:51.949 --> 24:53.576
if it's
instead of acting out?

24:55.036 --> 24:56.120
What?

24:56.412 --> 24:58.331
You can't get a pass
from God to jerk off.

24:58.623 --> 24:59.624
Who asked you?

24:59.916 --> 25:03.461
Steve, what are
you experiencing?

25:03.753 --> 25:07.590
I'm experiencing irritation.
And why are you irritated?

25:07.882 --> 25:09.902
It's like he thinks he's better
than everybody else.

25:09.926 --> 25:11.177
I feel that, too.

25:11.469 --> 25:12.970
Like, look
at his body language.

25:13.262 --> 25:15.973
Yeah, Steve's projecting his
masculine securities onto me,

25:16.265 --> 25:18.142
and Helen has to have
an opinion on everything.

25:18.434 --> 25:19.769
That's not true.

25:20.061 --> 25:21.861
Dane brings up some interesting points.
Really?

25:21.979 --> 25:24.208
It's like he can't do anything
wrong because of his past.

25:24.232 --> 25:25.792
You have no idea what
you're talking about!

25:25.816 --> 25:27.568
Okay. Then, Dane,
just tell us.

25:27.860 --> 25:29.153
No.

25:29.445 --> 25:30.923
You don't go get to tell
your reverend later

25:30.947 --> 25:32.823
about how you met
a junkie in treatment.

25:33.115 --> 25:35.409
I'm not like you,
and I'm glad I'm not like you.

25:35.701 --> 25:37.179
I don't even know you,
but one look at you,

25:37.203 --> 25:38.663
and I can tell
you're a dyke.

25:52.468 --> 25:54.887
How are you finding
God's Promise, Cameron?

25:57.139 --> 26:00.142
Uh... good.

26:03.479 --> 26:06.148
I hope you use this time
as an opportunity to examine

26:06.440 --> 26:08.442
the way you respond
to discomfort.

26:11.612 --> 26:13.281
Okay.

26:13.573 --> 26:16.576
Dane, this instinct
of yours to punish others

26:16.867 --> 26:20.955
for not having experienced
the kind of trauma you have,

26:21.247 --> 26:22.790
who does it remind you of?

26:23.082 --> 26:26.294
My father.

26:26.586 --> 26:28.963
I can't hear you.

26:31.882 --> 26:34.343
My father.

26:41.851 --> 26:44.228
Hey. How's it going?

26:44.520 --> 26:45.688
It's okay.

26:48.524 --> 26:49.734
Follow me.

27:01.621 --> 27:04.790
So, this worked for you, then?

27:05.082 --> 27:06.417
Like, you changed?

27:06.709 --> 27:09.920
Yes. I changed.

27:10.212 --> 27:12.340
How?

27:12.632 --> 27:14.592
It was a process.

27:14.884 --> 27:18.387
It's funny, actually.

27:18.679 --> 27:21.265
The moment things began
to turn around was in a bar.

27:21.557 --> 27:22.683
Bar?

27:22.975 --> 27:26.729
Yeah. A gay bar,
of all places.

27:27.021 --> 27:29.357
Two men from my church
came in.

27:29.649 --> 27:30.941
They saw my car
parked outside,

27:31.233 --> 27:32.502
and they knew
I'd been struggling,

27:32.526 --> 27:36.614
so they came in
looking for me.

27:36.906 --> 27:38.199
Wow.

27:38.491 --> 27:40.785
It was God, Cameron.

27:41.077 --> 27:42.495
I asked for His help,

27:42.787 --> 27:46.457
and He gave it to me
in the form of those allies.

27:46.749 --> 27:48.918
I was so deeply unhappy,

27:49.210 --> 27:53.047
but I didn't think
I was worth saving,

27:53.339 --> 27:55.716
and I wonder if you've
asked that of yourself.

27:57.843 --> 28:00.304
Are you worth saving?

28:07.311 --> 28:10.648
♪ It's gonna be fun
to Blessercize with Jesus ♪

28:10.940 --> 28:13.859
♪ To be fit for Him
in every way ♪

28:14.151 --> 28:16.904
♪ He will bless my body, soul,
and spirit... ♪

28:17.196 --> 28:20.282
You know it's God who created
these bodies of ours,

28:20.574 --> 28:22.284
and it's God who blesses them,

28:22.576 --> 28:24.078
and with His help,

28:24.370 --> 28:26.747
we can keep these bodies
working in optimum condition.

28:27.039 --> 28:28.332
Are you ready to start

28:28.624 --> 28:30.584
your "Fun to Be Fit"
Blessercize program?

28:30.876 --> 28:32.002
Huh? Come on, everybody!

28:32.294 --> 28:33.629
All right!

28:33.921 --> 28:36.006
You know, for too long,
we have disassociated

28:36.298 --> 28:39.885
our spiritual selves
from our physical selves,

28:40.177 --> 28:42.012
and it was only after the...

28:42.304 --> 28:45.433
only after I decided
to give God my body

28:45.725 --> 28:50.312
as well as my spirit and soul
that I discovered health...

28:50.604 --> 28:51.897
I mean, more energy

28:52.189 --> 28:53.941
than I think
I've ever known in my life!

28:54.233 --> 28:57.236
Keep it going. Good!

28:57.528 --> 29:00.656
You know, there's another
kind of warm-up that we do.

29:00.948 --> 29:02.575
Out you go and over.

29:02.867 --> 29:05.619
In fact, I think it's the most
important warm-up of all.

29:05.911 --> 29:07.538
It's our spiritual warm-up.

29:07.830 --> 29:10.124
After all, that's what this
whole program is all about.

29:10.416 --> 29:13.627
And up. Let's warm up
with a Bible verse.

29:13.919 --> 29:16.088
Hey. Jane.

29:17.798 --> 29:20.634
Just in time.

29:20.926 --> 29:23.053
It's a really intense hike.

29:23.345 --> 29:25.890
Your shoes don't
look right for it.

29:26.182 --> 29:28.058
Jane and I are wearing
the exact same shoes.

29:28.350 --> 29:30.728
Don't be so paranoid.

29:33.314 --> 29:35.691
A warning would be nice.

29:44.533 --> 29:46.744
So, they let you go on hikes
whenever you want?

29:47.036 --> 29:49.580
It's a gender-neutral sport.

29:49.872 --> 29:51.999
I mean, couldn't we
just walk off?

29:52.291 --> 29:53.667
And go where?

29:53.959 --> 29:55.771
Yeah, should we go directly
to Times Square to turn tricks,

29:55.795 --> 29:58.214
or would you rather try
break-dancing first?

29:58.506 --> 30:01.801
What's worse... karaoke night
or living on the streets?

30:02.092 --> 30:05.054
Tough call.

30:05.346 --> 30:07.014
What do you guys
think of Dr. Marsh?

30:07.306 --> 30:09.600
I guess it's like having
your own Disney villain,

30:09.892 --> 30:12.895
only this one won't
let you jerk off.

30:13.187 --> 30:15.898
I find her kind of sexy.

30:16.190 --> 30:21.070
Sex with Lydia would be like
fucking the mom from "Carrie."

30:21.362 --> 30:23.948
Cameron, Lydia...
hot or not?

30:24.240 --> 30:25.950
Ugh. No comment.

30:28.035 --> 30:29.787
What's her deal anyway?

30:30.079 --> 30:32.289
Like, I know why Rick is here,

30:32.581 --> 30:35.417
but why does she
give such a shit?

30:35.709 --> 30:37.878
She's not, like,
ex-gay, is she?

30:38.170 --> 30:39.922
Ew, no.
She's Rick's sister.

30:40.214 --> 30:41.549
Seriously?
Yeah.

30:41.841 --> 30:42.967
She degayed him.

30:43.259 --> 30:45.261
Like, before, she was
just a regular therapist,

30:45.553 --> 30:47.513
and then he became
her human guinea pig.

30:47.805 --> 30:50.266
Wow.

30:50.558 --> 30:53.769
I bet she gives, like,
wool socks for Christmas.

30:54.061 --> 30:55.938
I'd be so down with
wool socks for Christmas.

30:56.230 --> 30:58.350
My grandma would be down
for wool socks for Christmas.

30:58.440 --> 31:01.986
Old-people tastes and
lesbian tastes run parallel.

31:05.072 --> 31:06.907
How long have you
guys been here?

31:07.199 --> 31:10.619
I started last fall,
and Adam came spring semester.

31:12.663 --> 31:17.668
Do you still consider
yourself, like... gay?

31:17.960 --> 31:19.295
Don't answer that.

31:19.587 --> 31:21.964
You read our icebergs, but we
don't know shit about you.

31:22.256 --> 31:23.424
How'd you get here?

31:23.716 --> 31:25.676
Were you caught, or could
they just smell the SSA?

31:25.718 --> 31:29.305
You don't have to answer
that if you don't want.

31:29.597 --> 31:32.057
It's okay.

31:32.349 --> 31:33.350
What's SSA?

31:33.642 --> 31:35.352
Same-sex attraction.

31:35.644 --> 31:38.314
Like, with Mark, you can just
tell by looking at him.

31:38.606 --> 31:41.275
I'm pretty sure Erin
turned herself in,

31:41.567 --> 31:43.485
and I think Helen
probably thought

31:43.777 --> 31:45.571
she was going to music camp.

31:45.863 --> 31:50.326
My boyfriend walked in on me
and this girl, Coley.

31:50.618 --> 31:53.621
Shit.

31:53.913 --> 31:55.289
Where'd they send her?

31:55.581 --> 31:56.874
Nowhere.

31:57.166 --> 31:58.292
It's fucked up.

31:58.584 --> 32:01.295
It's not her fault.

32:04.423 --> 32:06.008
You should forget about her.

32:06.300 --> 32:08.594
Why?

32:08.886 --> 32:10.406
I mean, who's to say
I haven't already?

32:10.554 --> 32:12.115
It's just messed up
that your life had to stop

32:12.139 --> 32:14.516
and hers didn't.

32:19.563 --> 32:22.650
What happened
happened to both of us.

32:22.942 --> 32:25.819
I'm sure you'll work it out
when you get out of here.

32:26.111 --> 32:27.947
That sounded sarcastic,
but it's not.

32:28.238 --> 32:30.616
This is my genuine voice.

32:39.959 --> 32:43.253
♪ I keep changing,
but you're still the same ♪

32:48.133 --> 32:49.152
Lydia says we can
use the rec room

32:49.176 --> 32:50.678
if we wake up
early enough.

32:50.970 --> 32:52.972
Cool.

32:53.263 --> 32:55.683
Tandy Campbell's
a huge deal.

32:55.975 --> 32:58.102
I bet my aunt Ruth
totally knows about her.

32:58.394 --> 32:59.979
I'm sure.

33:00.270 --> 33:01.855
Blessercize has helped
so many people

33:02.147 --> 33:04.900
find their bodies through God,

33:05.192 --> 33:09.780
and I need a workout buddy,
so it's a perfect fit.

33:10.072 --> 33:12.408
Sounds like a plan.

33:30.718 --> 33:32.302
You should get in line.

33:36.765 --> 33:37.933
You're stealing?

33:38.225 --> 33:39.703
No. It's only stealing
if I actually leave

33:39.727 --> 33:41.454
the store with it, okay?
I put it back on the shelf.

33:41.478 --> 33:42.855
No. No way.

33:43.147 --> 33:44.732
Erin, please.

33:45.024 --> 33:47.144
You had the sin in your heart,
and that's what counts.

33:47.317 --> 33:48.652
I put it back on the shelf.

33:48.944 --> 33:50.547
I'm not being a good friend
if I ignore your sin.

33:50.571 --> 33:52.948
Nice vest.

33:56.326 --> 33:58.871
Okay, fine. I'll tell Rick.

33:59.163 --> 34:00.789
It's the right choice.

34:01.081 --> 34:03.792
Hey, guys.
Hi, Mark.

34:04.084 --> 34:05.895
So, I saw what happened.
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, okay?

34:05.919 --> 34:07.439
I put it back on the shelf.
Yeah, I-I know.

34:07.463 --> 34:09.380
But I-I also think
Erin was right to stop you.

34:09.672 --> 34:11.050
I know.
Thank you.

34:11.341 --> 34:14.178
That took a lot of courage.
Yeah, I know.

34:14.469 --> 34:18.306
But maybe we could keep
this between us three?

34:18.599 --> 34:19.808
Wait, really?
Wh-Why?

34:20.100 --> 34:21.494
I think that you made
a split-second mistake

34:21.518 --> 34:24.063
and you're sorry.

34:24.353 --> 34:25.856
That... That's just my opinion,

34:26.148 --> 34:27.733
so, you know,
what do you think?

34:28.025 --> 34:30.152
I don't know.

34:30.444 --> 34:31.820
Well, you've learned
your lesson?

34:32.112 --> 34:34.114
Yes. I'm... I'm so ashamed.

34:37.159 --> 34:38.827
I just want to look out
for you

34:39.119 --> 34:41.205
the way I hope you'd
look out for me.

34:41.496 --> 34:43.831
Yeah. Yeah, and you know
how much I appreciate that?

34:48.837 --> 34:50.839
Thank you.

36:37.821 --> 36:40.741
I want to use my voice
in service of God,

36:41.033 --> 36:45.204
and I can't do that if I'm
living with sin in my heart,

36:45.495 --> 36:48.373
and they could tell.

36:48.665 --> 36:53.045
Of course, they could all tell
that I was struggling with SSA,

36:53.337 --> 36:57.925
and they asked me
to leave the group,

36:58.217 --> 37:02.304
and it was...

37:02.596 --> 37:05.891
Yeah, it was
the worst day of my life.

37:12.356 --> 37:16.193
What about you?

37:16.485 --> 37:19.529
I was running with her faster.

37:19.821 --> 37:22.324
Did you hear that?
What?

37:22.616 --> 37:23.825
Cam, I'm home!

37:28.872 --> 37:30.832
Um...

37:33.961 --> 37:36.338
...I can't really
think of anything.

37:36.630 --> 37:38.340
Don't overthink it.

37:38.632 --> 37:40.425
When did your
same-sex attractions

37:40.717 --> 37:43.095
get in the way
of your goals?

37:47.557 --> 37:49.643
I don't know.

37:49.935 --> 37:52.020
Why can't you try?

37:54.898 --> 37:56.275
I mean, I am trying.

37:56.566 --> 37:57.566
No, you're not.

37:57.609 --> 38:00.195
What?
Is there a problem?

38:00.487 --> 38:02.322
I'm... I'm sorry.
I don't...

38:02.614 --> 38:04.741
I-Is this
just a joke to you?

38:05.033 --> 38:06.785
What? I-I didn't
even say anything.

38:07.077 --> 38:09.204
Exactly.
You never say anything,

38:09.496 --> 38:12.833
and... and your silence feels
aggressive and judgmental,

38:13.125 --> 38:14.376
and it makes the space
not safe.

38:14.668 --> 38:15.836
That's ridiculous.

38:16.128 --> 38:19.006
Well, Helen perceives
hostility in your behavior.

38:19.298 --> 38:20.465
You can agree or not,

38:20.757 --> 38:23.844
but you must recognize
that that is her truth.

38:26.221 --> 38:29.725
Well, I-I mean, what do you
want me to say?

38:30.017 --> 38:32.978
Anything.
Just be honest.

38:41.320 --> 38:44.614
Tell us about that girl
you knew from home.

38:51.580 --> 38:53.874
Okay. Um...

38:54.166 --> 38:57.794
her name was Coley.

38:58.086 --> 39:01.173
We were in the same
Bible study.

39:01.465 --> 39:03.842
What was she like?

39:06.803 --> 39:09.139
She was perfect.

39:10.599 --> 39:14.895
But she wasn't
full of herself.

39:15.187 --> 39:16.587
You know, she was
the type of person

39:16.730 --> 39:19.483
that, no matter who you were,
you'd meet her,

39:19.775 --> 39:21.568
and you'd... you'd want
to be her friend.

39:23.820 --> 39:28.241
It's said that cannibals
only eat the enemies they admire

39:28.533 --> 39:31.453
as a way to take inside
their best qualities.

39:33.789 --> 39:34.998
Okay.

39:35.290 --> 39:37.209
When you speak,
you reveal a compulsion

39:37.501 --> 39:39.294
to take into yourself

39:39.586 --> 39:41.838
the qualities you
admired in this girl.

39:46.218 --> 39:47.969
I wanted to be like her,

39:48.261 --> 39:50.555
and I confused that
with being with her?

39:50.847 --> 39:53.517
Correct.

39:56.436 --> 39:58.939
I guess that makes sense.

39:59.231 --> 40:03.527
It's like I thought
I was in love with Vicki Jones,

40:03.819 --> 40:07.197
but... what I really loved
was her perfect pitch.

40:27.217 --> 40:29.761
Looks like I'm going home
at the end of this semester.

40:30.053 --> 40:32.097
Oh, cool.

40:32.389 --> 40:34.057
Congratulations.

40:39.479 --> 40:41.231
Can I ask you
a personal question?

40:41.523 --> 40:42.941
Uh-huh, sure.

40:43.233 --> 40:44.818
Do you believe in God?

40:48.655 --> 40:50.699
Um...

40:56.329 --> 40:58.049
...I-I guess I don't...
I don't really know.

41:00.250 --> 41:02.711
Yeah. That's okay.

41:06.631 --> 41:09.718
I guess every time...

41:10.010 --> 41:12.679
I pray...

41:12.971 --> 41:16.266
I kind of feel like
I'm being phony.

41:17.392 --> 41:21.146
Yeah. I-I think everybody
can feel like that sometimes,

41:21.438 --> 41:22.958
but I also think that
those are moments

41:23.064 --> 41:26.485
where it's really important
to lean back on your faith

41:26.776 --> 41:28.820
and trust that that
will take you forward.

41:34.034 --> 41:35.952
I don't think I really
have any faith.

41:38.663 --> 41:40.582
Or at least I don't...

41:40.874 --> 41:42.474
really know how to go
about getting it...

41:44.920 --> 41:47.756
...or if I really want it.

41:48.048 --> 41:51.843
Look, I get it.
I'm not going to lie to you.

41:52.135 --> 41:54.971
I can feel very lost.

41:55.263 --> 42:00.352
But I find it important
to remember...

42:00.644 --> 42:02.938
one foot
in front of the other.

42:06.233 --> 42:08.033
You write here that
the positive reinforcement

42:08.151 --> 42:11.363
you receive for athleticism
confused your gender identity.

42:15.116 --> 42:17.118
Expand on that.

42:17.410 --> 42:20.372
Um...

42:20.664 --> 42:22.123
I don't know.

42:22.415 --> 42:24.543
You must have had a reason
to put it on your iceberg.

42:29.422 --> 42:31.925
Well, I was always
encouraged to compete.

42:32.217 --> 42:33.857
You know, I was all-state
track and field,

42:33.885 --> 42:37.764
so my entire family would
come and watch, cheer me on.

42:38.056 --> 42:40.225
That's how you
earned their love?

42:40.517 --> 42:43.353
No. I wouldn't say that.

42:43.645 --> 42:45.689
They weren't... like that.

42:45.981 --> 42:48.858
What were they like?

42:52.070 --> 42:54.489
They were fine.

42:54.781 --> 42:57.742
Cameron...

42:58.034 --> 42:59.536
if your parents
were still alive,

42:59.828 --> 43:02.455
do you think they'd
be proud of you?

43:05.709 --> 43:06.918
Uh, I don't know.

43:07.210 --> 43:09.671
Your aunt said they had
concerns about you.

43:22.851 --> 43:25.979
Cameron, your progress
is dependent

43:26.271 --> 43:28.148
on the effort you put in,

43:28.440 --> 43:30.025
in our work together.

43:30.317 --> 43:34.821
Your success or failure
is entirely in your own hands.

43:35.113 --> 43:38.867
Do you understand that?

43:39.159 --> 43:40.452
Okay.

43:40.744 --> 43:44.497
Okay.

44:55.318 --> 44:57.278
Fuck.

45:51.040 --> 45:52.792
Hello?

45:53.084 --> 45:54.085
Hey.

45:54.377 --> 45:57.464
Uh, it's me...

45:57.756 --> 45:59.048
Cameron.

46:01.217 --> 46:03.344
Hey.

46:03.636 --> 46:05.764
Are you at that place?

46:06.055 --> 46:08.850
Yeah. Um...

46:09.142 --> 46:11.895
listen, I've been thinking
about what happened,

46:12.187 --> 46:15.607
and I just want
to say I'm sorry.

46:15.899 --> 46:18.818
It was really shitty
the way it all went down.

46:19.110 --> 46:20.945
Yeah.

46:21.237 --> 46:24.199
Did you get my letter?
I sent you a letter.

46:24.491 --> 46:26.868
Wait, really?
Yeah.

46:27.160 --> 46:28.304
Hey, guys!
Time to wrap it up!

46:28.328 --> 46:29.328
Hey, eyes up here, guys!

46:29.537 --> 46:31.748
Coley, I have to...
I have to go.

46:32.040 --> 46:33.374
I'll call you back.

46:35.418 --> 46:37.498
How long did it take you guys
to get mail privileges?

46:37.629 --> 46:38.922
I don't know.

46:39.214 --> 46:42.467
Like, two months...
maybe longer.

46:42.759 --> 46:45.386
Hey! I did it!

46:45.678 --> 46:47.305
Great!

47:09.744 --> 47:11.496
What the...?

47:19.128 --> 47:22.382
Hey, Adam.

47:22.674 --> 47:24.509
What's winkte mean?

47:24.801 --> 47:27.762
Winkte?
Why do you ask?

47:28.054 --> 47:29.597
Um...

47:29.889 --> 47:31.266
I read it...

47:31.558 --> 47:33.518
on your iceberg.

47:35.270 --> 47:37.355
Yeah. It's a... It's a Lakotan
word for two-spirit.

47:37.647 --> 47:39.607
It's like a...
It's like a third gender.

47:41.985 --> 47:44.404
Okay, so, I am two-spirit,

47:44.696 --> 47:46.739
which, uh, means I was born
with a man's soul

47:47.031 --> 47:48.324
and a woman's soul,

47:48.616 --> 47:50.696
and, uh, literally, "winkte"
means "killed by woman,"

47:50.785 --> 47:52.078
so it's as if
the male part of me

47:52.370 --> 47:54.330
is being killed
by the female part.

47:54.622 --> 47:56.875
That make sense?

47:57.166 --> 48:00.003
He's basically like the
Native American David Bowie.

48:00.295 --> 48:03.172
I'll take it.

48:03.464 --> 48:05.133
So, why'd your parents
send you here?

48:05.425 --> 48:07.051
His dad got into politics,

48:07.343 --> 48:10.680
and then he converted
to Christianity.

48:10.972 --> 48:12.557
Me being like this...

48:12.849 --> 48:14.517
fucks his image.

48:23.860 --> 48:25.612
Did, um...

48:25.904 --> 48:28.104
Did Rick tell you guys the story
about how he was saved?

48:30.450 --> 48:32.452
You mean how Christian allies
happened upon his car

48:32.744 --> 48:35.914
in the parking lot of a gay bar
and went inside to investigate?

48:36.205 --> 48:38.458
There was this, like,
weird staredown,

48:38.750 --> 48:44.464
and everybody is like, "Fuck,"
and, finally, Rick is like,

48:44.756 --> 48:47.675
"Oh, my God. Did you guys
come here to save me?"

48:47.967 --> 48:53.139
They're like, "Oh, yeah. We were
driving, and we saw your car."

48:53.431 --> 48:56.017
"You drive the blue..."
"Gray Toyota Camry," yes.

48:56.309 --> 48:57.936
"Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Of course." Mm-hmm.

48:58.227 --> 48:59.987
We were driving.
We saw it, and we were like,

49:00.021 --> 49:03.566
'Wow, Rick really needs
our help finding God, '

49:03.858 --> 49:07.195
and that's why we're here,
not to suck your dick."

49:18.748 --> 49:21.709
That's really good.

49:22.001 --> 49:24.629
I'm too stoned
for art therapy.

49:27.507 --> 49:30.593
I'm sorry.
How is this supposed to help us?

49:30.885 --> 49:33.137
Just think of it as a test
of how far your bullshit

49:33.429 --> 49:35.098
can take you. Like...

49:35.390 --> 49:38.059
...let's see. Um...

49:38.351 --> 49:40.144
this woman riding a horse?
Mm-hmm.

49:40.436 --> 49:44.107
She's you galloping away
from a past of gender confusion

49:44.399 --> 49:48.027
and into a bright future
of opposite-sex lovemaking.

49:48.319 --> 49:49.445
And, uh...

49:49.737 --> 49:50.905
hold on.

49:51.197 --> 49:52.573
This cat...

49:52.865 --> 49:55.576
and this cat is the devil.
Think of it as your past,

49:55.868 --> 49:58.538
the temptations
and the dangers and...

49:58.830 --> 49:59.830
Hey, how are you?

50:00.081 --> 50:01.791
Good work, Adam.
Thank you.

50:03.960 --> 50:05.253
"Good work, Adam."

50:05.545 --> 50:07.255
This Pillsbury Doughboy?

50:07.547 --> 50:10.174
Domesticity and
comfort and family.

50:10.466 --> 50:13.011
I mean, just imagine you're
all sitting at a table together

50:13.302 --> 50:16.889
eating crescent rolls
like a healthy American family.

50:17.181 --> 50:21.019
It's like watching Michaelangelo
paint the Sistine Chapel.

50:21.310 --> 50:23.604
What? Why are you laughing?
You know I'm right.

50:23.896 --> 50:25.023
That is why I'm laughing.

50:25.314 --> 50:28.443
I mean, the system
is working on you.

50:28.735 --> 50:32.822
Fuck you. No, it's not
working on me at all.

Adam, if you don't get
that hair out of your eyes,

52:20.680 --> 52:21.840
I'll shave it off.
Yes, ma'am.

52:22.098 --> 52:24.684
Cameron, come with me.

52:24.976 --> 52:27.228
Shit.

52:36.237 --> 52:38.030
Why now?

52:38.322 --> 52:40.575
I think you'll benefit
from what's in those letters.

52:45.121 --> 52:47.081
Thank you.

53:19.655 --> 53:21.282
I'm sorry.

53:21.574 --> 53:25.244
It's just so messed up!

53:30.208 --> 53:34.462
I'm sorry.

Coley.

53:38.007 --> 53:40.635
Coley, please just get
out of the car.

53:42.511 --> 53:45.097
Coley, come on.
Just get out of the car.

53:52.146 --> 53:54.398
F-Fuck!

54:01.197 --> 54:02.865
Jamie, I...

54:07.578 --> 54:09.747
"Dear Cameron,
I'm very angry at you

54:10.039 --> 54:12.875
for taking advantage
of our friendship."

54:13.167 --> 54:15.795
Shit.
Keep reading it.

54:16.087 --> 54:18.047
"You already had this thing
in you, but I didn't.

54:18.339 --> 54:19.608
When I think of
how long it took me

54:19.632 --> 54:20.817
to gain the strength
to tell my mom..."

54:20.841 --> 54:23.678
She told.
It wasn't Jamie.

54:23.970 --> 54:27.848
What if she's right...

54:28.140 --> 54:30.059
you know, like I-I-I
took complete advantage

54:30.351 --> 54:31.477
of our friendship

54:31.769 --> 54:34.313
and I wasn't even aware
I was doing it?

54:34.605 --> 54:36.691
No.

54:36.983 --> 54:38.985
Pink stationery does not
get to fuck with you.

54:44.699 --> 54:47.785
This girl is spineless.

54:48.077 --> 54:49.704
Let's say what you
did was fucked up

54:49.996 --> 54:51.539
and you infected
her or whatever.

54:51.831 --> 54:54.208
It was a shit move
to rat you out.

54:54.500 --> 54:55.740
She was just trying to help me.

54:55.960 --> 54:58.296
She's a fucking rat.
And she misspelled "courage."

54:58.587 --> 55:00.464
Stop it.

55:00.756 --> 55:03.050
She's better than all of us.

55:03.342 --> 55:06.637
And I hurt her.

55:06.929 --> 55:12.518
What if this really is our only
chance and we're blowing it?

55:12.810 --> 55:15.521
I'm tired of feeling
disgusted with myself.

55:19.650 --> 55:21.861
Maybe you're supposed to feel
disgusted with yourself

55:22.153 --> 55:23.654
when you're a teenager.

55:58.397 --> 56:00.441
Hello?

56:00.733 --> 56:02.151
Ruth?

56:02.443 --> 56:03.903
Cam?

56:04.195 --> 56:05.821
Hey.

56:06.113 --> 56:09.492
What a nice surprise!
How are you?

56:09.784 --> 56:12.370
I miss you.

56:12.661 --> 56:14.622
Are you okay?

56:18.584 --> 56:22.380
If I told you
I was unhappy...

56:22.671 --> 56:27.176
and that I wanted
to come home...

56:27.468 --> 56:29.178
would you let me?

56:29.470 --> 56:31.263
Cam, come on.

56:31.555 --> 56:34.225
You have to give it a chance.

56:36.519 --> 56:39.730
You know I'm doing this
because I love you.

56:47.446 --> 56:50.157
Don't you want to have
a family someday?

56:56.288 --> 56:58.249
I love you, Cammie.

56:58.541 --> 57:01.544
I love you, too.

57:03.671 --> 57:05.423
Bye, Ruth.

57:39.748 --> 57:45.588
How are you feeling,
Cameron?

57:45.880 --> 57:49.175
Um...

57:49.467 --> 57:51.927
I'm okay.

57:52.219 --> 57:53.929
You don't seem okay.

57:58.267 --> 57:59.810
I've been better.

58:00.102 --> 58:04.899
You're facing the consequences
of your actions, and it's ugly.

58:08.402 --> 58:10.654
Now what?

58:10.946 --> 58:14.783
Now you stop fighting
the process.

58:25.544 --> 58:27.129
Are you ready?

58:27.421 --> 58:29.673
You know it's God who created
these bodies of ours

58:29.965 --> 58:32.092
and it's God who blesses them.

58:32.384 --> 58:37.056
And with His help, we can keep these
bodies working in optimum condition.

58:37.348 --> 58:40.059

"Fun to Be Fit" Blessercize program?

58:40.351 --> 58:42.061

It's just me.

59:59.388 --> 01:00:00.388
What the fuck?

01:00:00.639 --> 01:00:02.141
You were making
a lot of noise.

I'm sorry. I'm fine.

01:00:04.893 --> 01:00:07.229
What were you
dreaming about?

01:00:07.521 --> 01:00:09.231
I don't remember, okay?
It was scary.

01:00:09.523 --> 01:00:10.774
No, it wasn't.
Yeah, it was.

01:00:11.066 --> 01:00:12.986
How would you know?
You weren't dreaming with me.

01:00:13.152 --> 01:00:15.213
I was listening to you,
and those weren't scared noises.

01:00:15.237 --> 01:00:17.239
It was. This is ridiculous.
Go back to bed.

01:00:19.742 --> 01:00:21.035
I heard you.

01:00:21.327 --> 01:00:22.703

No. I-It's okay.
I'm good.

01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:46.537
What?

01:01:46.829 --> 01:01:48.914
Get off.

01:01:49.206 --> 01:01:52.042
Are you serious?

01:01:52.334 --> 01:01:55.170
I should go back
to my own bed now.

01:01:58.132 --> 01:01:59.591
Right now?

01:01:59.883 --> 01:02:01.927
They could do a pop-in
at any minute.

01:02:18.277 --> 01:02:20.821
You can't tell anyone, Cam.

01:02:21.113 --> 01:02:23.615
I won't.

01:02:23.907 --> 01:02:28.036
I really do want
to get past this.

01:02:28.328 --> 01:02:29.621
Yeah. I believe you.

01:02:29.913 --> 01:02:31.790
I don't care if you
believe me or not.

01:02:35.794 --> 01:02:38.046
I knew this would happen.

01:02:38.338 --> 01:02:40.632
I didn't.

01:02:43.302 --> 01:02:46.054
Because you don't
think of me that way.

01:02:59.985 --> 01:03:02.946
Is part of the reason why you
watch those Tandy Campbell videos

01:03:03.238 --> 01:03:05.783
'cause she's kind of hot,
huh?

01:03:06.074 --> 01:03:08.577
We shouldn't encourage each
other's homosexual attractions.

Are you fucking
serious right now?

01:03:10.746 --> 01:03:12.474
I don't want to talk anymore.
I just want to go to sleep.

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:47.402
Mark, why don't
you start us off?

01:05:51.615 --> 01:05:54.785
I know you've had
an especially hard week.

01:05:55.077 --> 01:05:56.912
No. I...

01:05:57.204 --> 01:05:58.956
Every week
is especially hard.

01:05:59.247 --> 01:06:00.457
Is there something...

01:06:00.749 --> 01:06:03.585
Look, if you want me
to talk about my father,

01:06:03.877 --> 01:06:07.464
then I'd prefer
if you just ask.

01:06:07.756 --> 01:06:10.092
Sounds like you want to talk
about your father's decision.

01:06:10.384 --> 01:06:13.220
I don't see what
there is to talk about.

01:06:13.512 --> 01:06:15.889
I mean,
you've read his letter.

01:06:22.312 --> 01:06:23.480
"I am denying your request

01:06:23.772 --> 01:06:26.608
to return home at the end
of the semester.

01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:29.444
You are still
very effeminate...

01:06:29.736 --> 01:06:33.448
and this is a weakness
I cannot have in my home."

01:06:35.909 --> 01:06:37.577
How did that make you feel?

01:06:40.038 --> 01:06:43.125
I'd like to read a passage.

01:06:43.417 --> 01:06:45.043
It's one of my
father's favorites.

01:06:45.335 --> 01:06:47.713
Please do.

01:06:59.725 --> 01:07:02.310
"There was given to me
a thorn in the flesh..."

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:09.735
"...the messenger of Satan
to buffet me,

01:07:10.027 --> 01:07:12.154
lest I should be
exalted above measure."

01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:19.369
"And for this thing,

01:07:19.661 --> 01:07:21.413
I besought the Lord
thrice..."

01:07:23.874 --> 01:07:26.334
"...that it might depart
from me."

01:07:30.047 --> 01:07:31.757
"And unto me he said..."

01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:37.345
"...'My grace is sufficient
for thee...'"

01:07:42.309 --> 01:07:46.938
"'...for my strength is made
perfect in weakness.'"

01:07:53.361 --> 01:07:56.865
"Most gladly, therefore,
will I rather...

01:07:57.157 --> 01:07:59.993
will I rather glory
in infirmities,

01:08:00.285 --> 01:08:04.206
that the power of Christ
may rest upon me.

in infirmities, in...

01:08:09.044 --> 01:08:10.044
in reproaches,

01:08:10.295 --> 01:08:12.172
in necessities,
in persecutions,

01:08:12.464 --> 01:08:14.174
in distresses,
for Christ's sake,

01:08:14.466 --> 01:08:17.010
for when I am weak,
then am I strong!

01:08:17.301 --> 01:08:18.970
For when I am weak..."

01:08:22.515 --> 01:08:24.142
"...then am I strong."

01:08:29.606 --> 01:08:32.567
"When I am weak...

01:08:32.859 --> 01:08:34.152
then am I strong."

01:09:01.095 --> 01:09:03.140
There is no need for theatrics.

01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:05.310
No, I've got this weakness,
but this weakness...

01:09:05.392 --> 01:09:06.743
If weakness equals strength...
Please sit down.

01:09:06.768 --> 01:09:08.287
...then this weakness
makes me strong, right?

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:09.663
Discuss the passage
you have selected.

01:09:09.688 --> 01:09:11.249
Give me the strength
of 10 Marks, of 20 Marks!

01:09:11.273 --> 01:09:13.513
When I am weak, I am strong!
When I am weak, I am strong!

01:09:13.733 --> 01:09:16.236
Mark, stop it!
When I am weak, I am strong!

01:09:16.528 --> 01:09:17.648
When I am weak, I am strong!

01:09:17.904 --> 01:09:19.215
Mark!
When I am weak, I am strong!

01:09:19.238 --> 01:09:20.866
Stop it right now!
Strong, strong!

01:09:35.255 --> 01:09:36.255
I am strong!

01:09:36.423 --> 01:09:37.424
I am strong!

01:09:37.716 --> 01:09:40.260
I am strong! I am weak!
Stop it!

01:09:40.551 --> 01:09:43.430
I will remove my foot

01:09:43.721 --> 01:09:46.433
when you are ready to
get control of yourself.

01:10:41.488 --> 01:10:42.781
I know
that some of you are aware

01:10:43.073 --> 01:10:48.078
that Mark had a little bit
of an accident last night.

01:10:48.370 --> 01:10:49.829
Adam found him in the bathroom,

01:10:50.121 --> 01:10:51.998
and we rushed him
to the hospital.

01:10:54.542 --> 01:10:55.710
His dad's already flown out.

01:10:56.002 --> 01:10:59.422
He is stable, and he's
going to be okay.

01:10:59.714 --> 01:11:01.383
Fuck this.

01:11:01.675 --> 01:11:03.051
You guys are talking
in circles.

01:11:03.343 --> 01:11:05.220
If he didn't kill himself,
then what did he do?

01:11:05.512 --> 01:11:06.846
Dane, yelling and swearing

01:11:07.138 --> 01:11:09.033
won't help you feel better
about what happened to Mark.

01:11:09.057 --> 01:11:11.297
See, that's where you're wrong,
'cause it does, actually.

01:11:11.351 --> 01:11:13.061
It makes me feel
a fuck of a lot better.

01:11:20.110 --> 01:11:22.153
What the fuck is wrong
with you, Helen?

01:11:22.445 --> 01:11:23.571
I'm sorry.

01:11:23.863 --> 01:11:26.700
I can't stop.

01:11:26.992 --> 01:11:28.272
Okay. Everybody go
to your rooms.

01:11:28.535 --> 01:11:31.204
We're going to have
individual one-on-ones.

01:11:33.999 --> 01:11:36.001
Go to your rooms
until we call you!

01:11:38.086 --> 01:11:39.921
Helen and Dane, stay.

01:11:44.551 --> 01:11:46.928
Is he going to be all right?

01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:50.348
I think so.

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:54.394
It is a serious injury.

01:11:54.686 --> 01:11:57.105
This is
completely pointless

01:11:57.397 --> 01:11:59.065
if you don't tell me
what's happened.

01:12:02.235 --> 01:12:07.032
I can tell you what happened,
if that's what you want.

01:12:07.324 --> 01:12:08.825
But it's... It's, uh...

01:12:09.117 --> 01:12:10.452
I can handle ugly.

01:12:17.334 --> 01:12:23.006
Last night, Mark used a razor to
cut his genitals several times.

01:12:23.298 --> 01:12:25.383
Then he poured bleach
over the wounds.

01:12:33.224 --> 01:12:35.685
Adam found him.

01:12:42.359 --> 01:12:44.819
If you were worried about him,
why did you leave him alone?

01:12:54.496 --> 01:12:56.498
I don't have a very
good answer for you.

01:13:02.212 --> 01:13:04.130
Is Adam okay?

01:13:04.422 --> 01:13:09.094
I think so,
all things considered.

01:13:09.386 --> 01:13:12.389
It is going to take him
some time to process.

01:13:17.519 --> 01:13:18.895
How the fuck do you process

01:13:19.187 --> 01:13:21.564
watching your roommate try
and cut his dick off?

01:13:24.734 --> 01:13:27.070
What's he going to do,
put it on his iceberg?

01:13:34.494 --> 01:13:36.621
You people have no idea
what you're doing, do you?

01:13:41.376 --> 01:13:43.545
You're just making it up
as you go along.

01:13:59.936 --> 01:14:01.536
I don't know how
to answer you right now.

01:14:01.729 --> 01:14:04.524
I...

01:14:04.816 --> 01:14:07.193
I'm so sorry.

01:14:10.238 --> 01:14:12.991
I'm so sorry.

01:15:14.385 --> 01:15:18.348
Um, mostly
independent study.

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:21.518
Do you have access to the
outdoors on a regular basis?

01:15:21.809 --> 01:15:22.936
Yeah.

01:15:23.228 --> 01:15:25.271
Do you feel safe
in your dorm rooms at night?

01:15:25.563 --> 01:15:27.649
Yeah.

01:15:27.941 --> 01:15:31.277
Do you feel threatened by staff
members or fellow students?

01:15:31.569 --> 01:15:33.613
No.

01:15:33.905 --> 01:15:35.573
Do you trust those
in charge here?

01:15:39.619 --> 01:15:41.913
Not really.

01:15:42.205 --> 01:15:45.416
You don't trust
the staff here?

01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:50.463
Well, what do you...
I mean, trust them how?

01:15:50.755 --> 01:15:52.840
Do you think they have
your best interests in mind?

01:15:55.969 --> 01:15:59.138
No one's, you know,
beating us.

01:16:01.474 --> 01:16:03.518
But you asked me
if I trust them.

01:16:05.603 --> 01:16:07.021
And, sure, yeah.

01:16:07.313 --> 01:16:08.898
I trust them to drive
the van safely,

01:16:09.190 --> 01:16:11.192
and I trust them
to buy food, but...

01:16:16.573 --> 01:16:20.159
Look, I know you're here because
of what happened to Mark.

01:16:20.451 --> 01:16:22.829
Something didn't
just happen to him.

01:16:23.121 --> 01:16:25.957
He injured himself.

01:16:26.249 --> 01:16:28.585
While under the care
of this facility.

01:16:28.876 --> 01:16:31.212
Correct, and that's
why I'm here,

01:16:31.504 --> 01:16:33.381
to investigate the care
that is given

01:16:33.673 --> 01:16:35.842
by those
who run this facility,

01:16:36.134 --> 01:16:38.803
not to investigate
the mission of this facility,

01:16:39.095 --> 01:16:42.807
unless that includes
abuse or neglect.

01:16:43.099 --> 01:16:45.935
Yeah, but what about
emotional abuse?

01:16:46.227 --> 01:16:47.871
Are you saying you're
being emotionally abused

01:16:47.895 --> 01:16:51.608
by the staff here?

01:16:51.899 --> 01:16:54.611
How is programming people
to hate themselves

01:16:54.902 --> 01:16:56.779
not emotional abuse?

01:16:59.782 --> 01:17:01.326
I've made note
of what you said,

01:17:01.618 --> 01:17:03.536
and it will be
in the official file.

01:17:09.667 --> 01:17:12.128
Thank you.

01:17:29.354 --> 01:17:31.314
I didn't even know
Mark shaved.

01:17:33.232 --> 01:17:35.276
He doesn't.

01:17:35.568 --> 01:17:38.821
It was my razor.

01:17:45.578 --> 01:17:47.914
I thought he was dead.

01:18:08.643 --> 01:18:11.229
Fuck this place.

01:18:18.027 --> 01:18:19.696
I'll steal the keys to the van.

01:18:19.987 --> 01:18:22.281
We'll be in Canada by morning.

01:18:44.887 --> 01:18:47.056
I'm going to turn
the light off.

01:18:47.348 --> 01:18:49.308
Okay.

01:19:43.863 --> 01:19:45.656
Early bird
gets the worm, huh?

01:19:45.948 --> 01:19:47.825
You know it.

01:19:51.454 --> 01:19:54.290
What are y'all
doing up so early?

01:19:54.582 --> 01:19:56.959
Um, we went on a hike.

01:19:57.251 --> 01:20:00.421
Sounds fun.

01:20:11.182 --> 01:20:14.143
So, how's it going?
Good. Real good.

01:20:16.395 --> 01:20:19.899
I found out we'll be getting
a new disciple...

01:20:20.191 --> 01:20:22.819
young man from Indiana.

01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:25.350
Looks like you'll be getting
a new roommate on Wednesday.

01:20:25.446 --> 01:20:27.824
Oh, cool. Can't wait.

01:20:43.714 --> 01:20:47.468
So, you seen any
new movies lately?

01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:49.512
I finally watched
"Young Frankenstein"

01:20:49.804 --> 01:20:52.265
on your recommendation.

01:20:52.557 --> 01:20:55.685
I haven't laughed
that hard in a long time.

01:20:55.977 --> 01:20:57.353
I figured
you'd like that one.

01:20:57.645 --> 01:21:00.857
Mm. I love that part with
the elbow kiss, you know?

01:21:01.148 --> 01:21:02.567
Right.
"Not on the lips!"

01:21:05.194 --> 01:21:08.072
My dad and I
used to do that.

01:21:16.789 --> 01:21:20.376
We should go, you know,
so we can make our day.

01:21:20.668 --> 01:21:23.462
You guys are serious hikers.
I'm impressed.

01:21:23.754 --> 01:21:27.550
Maybe next time I'll come.
Yeah, definitely.

01:21:34.098 --> 01:21:35.099
Have fun.

01:21:35.391 --> 01:21:38.269
You, too.

01:21:38.561 --> 01:21:41.355
