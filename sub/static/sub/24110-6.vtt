00:01.523 --> 00:03.003
My name is Dylan Reinhart.
Not too long ago,

00:03.046 --> 00:06.702
I was an operative in the CIA
known as Agent Reinhart.

00:06.745 --> 00:09.400
When I left the Agency
and started teaching,

00:09.444 --> 00:10.706
I became Professor Reinhart.

00:10.749 --> 00:12.403
I wrote a book
about abnormal behavior

00:12.447 --> 00:14.884
and criminals,
which was so successful

00:14.927 --> 00:17.843
a serial killer used it
as clues for his murders.

00:17.887 --> 00:19.454
That's when the
New York Police Department

00:19.497 --> 00:21.282
reached out to me
to help catch him.

00:21.325 --> 00:23.110
Which I did, so they hired me,

00:23.153 --> 00:24.720
and I became
Consultant Reinhart.

00:24.763 --> 00:26.635
So now I'm working
with this woman,

00:26.678 --> 00:28.289
Detective Lizzie Needham

00:28.332 --> 00:30.639
of the homicide division,
catching killers.

00:30.682 --> 00:32.423
Looks like I need a new name.

00:32.467 --> 00:34.121
Don't they call you
Professor Psychopath?

00:37.515 --> 00:39.474
♪

00:39.517 --> 00:41.084
[indistinct police radio
communication]

00:45.567 --> 00:48.526
Officer, our murder suspect
is Theodore Burton.

00:48.570 --> 00:51.181
Last seen leaving the residence
of his mortgage broker,

00:51.225 --> 00:53.923
who he stabbed and killed.
He's armed and dangerous.

00:53.966 --> 00:56.665
Let's get this out to
all units working.

00:56.708 --> 00:59.102
Hey, go to 47 Wall Street--
Potter & Marley.

00:59.146 --> 01:00.669
Theo has an appointment there
in 15 minutes.

01:00.712 --> 01:04.020
85 me two units
to Potter & Marley Investments

01:04.064 --> 01:05.630
for arrest assistance.

01:05.674 --> 01:06.979
The suspect has one victim

01:07.023 --> 01:08.851
and may be on his way
to kill again.

01:13.508 --> 01:15.118
Here. My dupe shield.

01:15.162 --> 01:16.815
Dupe shield?
Duplicate.

01:16.859 --> 01:19.166
A place like this won't let
you in without a badge,

01:19.209 --> 01:20.515
and we don't have
time to explain.

01:23.648 --> 01:25.302
LIZZIE:
Theo?

01:26.347 --> 01:28.088
Theo?
No. No!

01:31.700 --> 01:33.919
Wait. Hey, hey. Okay,
everybody, please stay calm.

01:33.963 --> 01:35.225
Stay seated.
Let us handle this.

01:39.229 --> 01:40.535
I'll go talk to him.

01:40.578 --> 01:42.189
No, you won't.
You're gonna wait

01:42.232 --> 01:44.104
for the hostage
negotiators to get here.

01:45.540 --> 01:47.411
Okay.
Dylan.

01:47.455 --> 01:48.543
Wait.
Theo.

01:48.586 --> 01:49.935
Dylan.My name is Dylan. I'm not a cop.

01:49.979 --> 01:52.024
I-I just want
to talk to you.

01:52.068 --> 01:53.678
I want to hear your
side of the story.

01:54.505 --> 01:56.072
You want to talk?

01:56.116 --> 01:57.334
Yeah.

01:57.378 --> 01:58.466
Talk to these con men.

01:58.509 --> 01:59.684
Oh, they're your best buddy

01:59.728 --> 02:01.208
when you're
writing a check.

02:01.251 --> 02:03.558
Yeah, all these
great stocks they got.

02:05.560 --> 02:07.475
And then they rob you blind!

02:08.563 --> 02:09.694
You trusted them?

02:11.261 --> 02:12.828
But it's their system.

02:12.871 --> 02:14.482
They control it.

02:15.526 --> 02:17.789
I manage a grocery store.

02:17.833 --> 02:19.748
Well, you gotta be smart
with your money.

02:19.791 --> 02:21.358
Yeah.

02:21.402 --> 02:24.666
I invested 12% a month
every month for 15 years.

02:26.842 --> 02:28.409
It's gone.

02:28.452 --> 02:29.627
All of it.

02:29.671 --> 02:32.543
:
This company stole my nest egg.

02:32.587 --> 02:34.415
They took everything.

02:34.458 --> 02:35.590
Just isn't fair.

02:35.633 --> 02:36.982
I get it.

02:38.288 --> 02:40.421
There's nothing I can do
about it.

02:40.464 --> 02:41.639
They make their money
off your hard work.

02:43.511 --> 02:45.556
The world just isn't set up
to protect the little guy.

02:45.600 --> 02:46.557
No,

02:46.601 --> 02:48.255
tell those cops
not to arrest me.

02:48.298 --> 02:50.213
No, no. They should arrest
these thieves.

02:50.257 --> 02:51.519
They-they should arrest
the whole entire company!

02:51.562 --> 02:53.434
Theo, look at me.
Keep your eyes on me. Theo!

02:53.477 --> 02:54.870
THEO:
I have a family.

02:54.913 --> 02:56.611
I-I can't go to jail.

02:57.699 --> 02:58.961
I won't!

02:59.004 --> 03:00.702
I-I won't, I won't!

03:03.618 --> 03:05.359
Ow! My leg! Aah! My leg!

03:08.884 --> 03:10.799
Ow. My leg. Ow.

03:14.716 --> 03:17.675
Oh, I can practically see
the germs floating around us.

03:17.719 --> 03:19.329
If you're not sick
when you get here,

03:19.373 --> 03:20.765
you will be when you leave.

03:20.809 --> 03:22.071
Hospitals are the worst.

03:22.114 --> 03:23.725
Except for the whole
"healing people" thing.

03:23.768 --> 03:25.727
There is that. When I get home,
I'm going to bathe

03:25.770 --> 03:26.858
in hand sanitizer.MAN: Excuse me, sir.

03:26.902 --> 03:27.990
Police. She's with me.

03:28.033 --> 03:29.644
I'm the police.I just said that.

03:29.687 --> 03:32.473
Don't ever do that again.Or what

03:32.516 --> 03:36.346
When I ask you to wait for the
hostage negotiators, you wait.

03:36.390 --> 03:38.609
Theo was there because he felt
he had no control.

03:38.653 --> 03:40.742
The banks had lost his money,
and he had no recourse.

03:40.785 --> 03:42.483
He was pushed into crisis.

03:42.526 --> 03:44.311
The-the tension
in his voice, the...

03:44.354 --> 03:45.964
the impulsive twitching
of his body.

03:46.008 --> 03:47.792
We couldn't wait
for the negotiators.

03:47.836 --> 03:48.967
He needed to feel
listened to.

03:49.011 --> 03:50.795
Hey.
Hey.

03:50.839 --> 03:51.666
NURSE:
He's on a morphine
drip for pain,

03:51.709 --> 03:53.668
and we just hung
antibiotics.

03:53.711 --> 03:55.931
How soon
will I get out of here?Not up to me.

03:58.542 --> 04:00.022
Don't let them anywhere near me.

04:00.065 --> 04:02.677
Calm down.You try and clock
me one more time,

04:02.720 --> 04:04.461
I will give you
something to cry about.

04:04.505 --> 04:05.767
Don't make me talk
to the police!

04:05.810 --> 04:07.377
You didn't want
to talk to the cops,

04:07.421 --> 04:09.074
shouldn't have been
playing with knives.

04:16.647 --> 04:18.780
Ah, the miracle of
modern medicine.

04:18.823 --> 04:20.695
The miracle of
lorazepam, you mean.

04:20.738 --> 04:23.001
Two milligrams is like
a wrench to the head.

04:25.177 --> 04:27.005
I feel bad for that guy.

04:27.049 --> 04:28.746
He was taken advantage of.

04:28.790 --> 04:30.966
Doesn't give him
the right to kill.

04:31.009 --> 04:33.098
Are you okay?
You look off.

04:33.142 --> 04:35.449
Well, I just...
I'm not good with hospitals.

04:36.493 --> 04:38.060
Oh, Nurse Albany? Hi.

04:38.103 --> 04:39.453
I'm...
Give me a sec.

04:39.496 --> 04:40.628
We're police.
We need an update

04:40.671 --> 04:42.238
on Theo Burton's
condition, please.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.848
Knife wound to the leg.

04:43.892 --> 04:44.719
Hemodynamically stable.

04:44.762 --> 04:45.894
He'll be fine.

04:45.937 --> 04:47.417
You have a lovely
bedside manner.

04:47.461 --> 04:48.810
When can we
talk to him?

04:48.853 --> 04:50.290
After his CT angio.

04:50.333 --> 04:51.813
I told you, your wife
has been discharged.

04:51.856 --> 04:53.728
You can't send her
to the nursing home like this.

04:53.771 --> 04:55.730
ALBANY: Get her shoes on.MAN: She could
get septic again,

04:55.773 --> 04:57.340
and we'll be
back here tomorrow.

04:57.384 --> 04:58.863
ALBANY: She got her antibiotics.
She'll be fine.

04:58.907 --> 05:00.125
Move the meat, right?

05:00.169 --> 05:02.563
Because that's all
sick people are to you?

05:02.606 --> 05:03.912
You keep discharging
her too early.

05:03.955 --> 05:05.740
How about
a little compassion?

05:05.783 --> 05:06.958
Here's your compassion.

05:07.002 --> 05:09.221
Leave on your own,
or I call security.

05:09.265 --> 05:11.702
Nurses on TV
are so much nicer.

05:11.746 --> 05:13.965
Nurses on TV aren't real.

05:14.009 --> 05:16.359
Oh, I didn't know dogs
were allowed in the E.R.

05:16.403 --> 05:17.926
ALBANY:
No dogs!

05:17.969 --> 05:19.754
I need this E.R.
to remain sanitary.

05:19.797 --> 05:21.843
I need Conan for my anxiety.

05:21.886 --> 05:24.149
See a shrink,
and get the dog out!

05:24.193 --> 05:26.543
WOMAN :
Blue team to E.R.

05:26.587 --> 05:27.762
Blue team to E.R.

05:29.807 --> 05:30.895
NURSE:
This patient's gonna arrest!

05:30.939 --> 05:31.809
Bring a crash cart!

05:31.853 --> 05:33.681
Get a doctor in here!

05:33.724 --> 05:36.423
Respiration's shallow.DYLAN: That's Theo.

05:36.466 --> 05:38.425
He's bradying down.
BP's dropping.

05:38.468 --> 05:39.774
DOCTOR: Someone get me
an amp of atropine now.

05:39.817 --> 05:41.819
Doctor, he's in v-fib.Call a code!

05:43.125 --> 05:45.388
ALBANY :
Code blue in the E.R.

05:45.432 --> 05:47.216
Code Blue in Emergency.

05:47.259 --> 05:48.783
The nurse said
he was fine.

05:48.826 --> 05:50.393
Then why does it look
like they're losing him?

05:50.437 --> 05:51.786
I thought this
patient was stable.
He was.

05:51.829 --> 05:53.091
DOCTOR:
Charging. Clear!

05:57.008 --> 05:58.793
This makes no sense.DOCTOR: Shock again.

05:58.836 --> 05:59.881
Charging.

05:59.924 --> 06:01.099
Clear.

06:15.984 --> 06:18.334
♪

06:26.516 --> 06:28.431
So, let me get this straight:
Your perp was

06:28.475 --> 06:30.477
stable one minute, then dead
the next

06:30.520 --> 06:32.261
Yeah. The doctor was flummoxed.Flummoxed?

06:32.304 --> 06:33.349
Poleaxed.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.916
He thinks it might have been

06:34.959 --> 06:36.483
an undetected
vascular compromise, but...

06:36.526 --> 06:38.223
He was fishing
for answers.

06:38.267 --> 06:40.487
The hospital is scheduling a
quality review of the case.

06:40.530 --> 06:42.097
Yeah, don't hold
your breath.

06:42.140 --> 06:43.707
They've got
more red tape than we do.

06:43.751 --> 06:45.535
FUCCI: Needham, Doc,
don't shoot the messenger,

06:45.579 --> 06:46.884
but you got a CUPI.

06:46.928 --> 06:49.017
A CUPI

06:49.060 --> 06:52.150
Circumstances undetermined
pending investigation.

06:52.194 --> 06:53.500
A CUPI's a case that
keeps on kicking

06:53.543 --> 06:54.979
even after death.

06:55.023 --> 06:56.677
It is worse than contagious.

06:56.720 --> 06:59.897
Someone called the tip line
about your man Theo Burton.

06:59.941 --> 07:01.464
"Your suspect is not
the first person

07:01.508 --> 07:04.467
that Crosstown Hospital
m... murdered."

07:09.690 --> 07:12.040
MAN:
Murdering patients

07:12.083 --> 07:14.042
That's quite
an accusation.

07:14.085 --> 07:17.219
Theodore Burton was stable when
he died in your E.R. yesterday.

07:17.262 --> 07:18.742
Detectives,
it's a hospital.

07:18.786 --> 07:20.048
Sometimes people die.

07:20.091 --> 07:21.919
Sometimes people live.Look, I get it.

07:21.963 --> 07:24.008
We just have to follow
up on these things.

07:24.052 --> 07:26.097
It's procedure.Well, an unexpected death

07:26.141 --> 07:28.056
hardly indicates criminality.

07:28.099 --> 07:30.406
The majority of
the patient deaths that occur

07:30.450 --> 07:32.800
in Crosstown General's E.R.
are among

07:32.843 --> 07:34.366
the critically injured,
ill, or DOA.

07:34.410 --> 07:36.238
We are not talking about
the majority of deaths.

07:36.281 --> 07:38.022
We're talking
about people who die

07:38.066 --> 07:39.502
in unexpected or
unusual circumstances.

07:39.546 --> 07:41.983
As a hospital administrator,
maybe you can help us out

07:42.026 --> 07:44.159
with a list of patients
who have recently died.

07:44.202 --> 07:46.509
Patient privacy laws
won't allow that.

07:46.553 --> 07:48.032
So I'll get a
subpoena, come back,

07:48.076 --> 07:49.817
and then you'll give me a list?

07:50.992 --> 07:52.950
Can we streamline that process?

07:52.994 --> 07:54.517
Not without a warrant, we can't.

07:55.692 --> 07:58.042
Sorry. I just heard
about this meeting.

07:58.086 --> 08:00.131
These folks
are from the precinct.

08:00.175 --> 08:01.959
This is Dr. James Walters,

08:02.003 --> 08:03.526
a very busy
E.R. physician.

08:03.570 --> 08:05.310
I'm also the chief
quality officer

08:05.354 --> 08:07.138
for the Emergency Department,
so if you have any concerns

08:07.182 --> 08:09.184
about irregularities,
I'm never too busy

08:09.227 --> 08:10.838
to answer questions.

08:10.881 --> 08:13.014
So, there have been
irregularities?

08:13.057 --> 08:14.537
ADMINISTRATOR:
Not at all.

08:14.581 --> 08:15.843
There is one E.R. nurse

08:15.886 --> 08:17.322
currently under
administrative review.

08:17.366 --> 08:19.194
Not for any malfeasance,
of course.

08:19.237 --> 08:20.935
Nurse Albany
has our full support.

08:20.978 --> 08:22.545
She's a top-notch
caregiver...

08:22.589 --> 08:24.155
:
I'm sorry, Detectives.

08:24.199 --> 08:25.374
My legal department won't allow

08:25.417 --> 08:27.202
such disclosures.

08:27.245 --> 08:29.073
Uh, please...

08:29.117 --> 08:31.249
strike that nurse's name
from your record.

08:33.991 --> 08:36.559
Gentlemen, I trust that
you will send our perp

08:36.603 --> 08:39.388
Theo Burton's body to
the M.E. for an autopsy.

08:41.303 --> 08:42.957
That was her name--
Nurse Albany.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.350
The same nurse who was looking
after Theo before he died.

08:45.394 --> 08:46.830
So Reilly's
suspicious of her,

08:46.874 --> 08:48.440
and that's why he's
put her on review,

08:48.484 --> 08:49.659
or he's covering
something up.

08:49.703 --> 08:51.835
The man is clearly
a snake in a suit.

08:51.879 --> 08:53.794
Okay, so even if
he is a reptile,

08:53.837 --> 08:55.839
he still can't give us
names without a subpoena.

08:55.883 --> 08:57.493
But while we wait
for that subpoena,

08:57.537 --> 08:58.799
more patients could die.

08:58.842 --> 08:59.843
We've gotta keep digging.

08:59.887 --> 09:01.236
I know that
following the rules

09:01.279 --> 09:02.890
is a tough
concept for you,

09:02.933 --> 09:04.456
but we have certain
protocols and procedures,

09:04.500 --> 09:06.023
and they're there
for a reason.

09:06.067 --> 09:07.851
Rules can influence
behavior,

09:07.895 --> 09:10.288
but behavior can also
influence rules.

09:10.332 --> 09:12.290
I'm not talking
about behavior and rules.

09:12.334 --> 09:14.249
I'm talking about the law.

09:14.292 --> 09:16.077
I'm gonna call in
for a subpoena.

09:16.120 --> 09:18.862
And your digging--
keep it legal.

09:18.906 --> 09:20.560
Don't tell me.

09:20.603 --> 09:22.866
You need intel, and the
NYPD's slowing you down.

09:22.910 --> 09:24.694
This is why I left the CIA.

09:24.738 --> 09:26.696
Because your mind works
a million miles a minute

09:26.740 --> 09:28.742
and everyone else's moves
like they're running underwater?

09:28.785 --> 09:30.265
No, I left because
I couldn't stand

09:30.308 --> 09:31.875
working in an
institution.

09:31.919 --> 09:35.096
You do realize the NYPD
is an institution, don't you?

09:35.139 --> 09:36.532
Thank you for
enlightening me.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.882
And I'm a consultant, so...

09:38.926 --> 09:40.536
You've never liked authority.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.146
While you've
been a big fan?

09:43.583 --> 09:44.932
We're not with the
Company anymore.

09:44.975 --> 09:47.674
We're free to
work how we want.

09:47.717 --> 09:49.676
Think of the fun we could have.

09:49.719 --> 09:51.329
There have been
some unusual deaths

09:51.373 --> 09:53.549
in the E.R.
at Crosstown General Hospital.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.813
I have been digging around
but found next to nothing.

09:56.857 --> 09:58.423
I need to know
what they're not telling us.

09:58.467 --> 10:00.121
Maybe they're telling the truth.

10:00.164 --> 10:01.644
Oh, yeah, because
big corporations

10:01.688 --> 10:03.733
just love to share the truth.

10:06.562 --> 10:09.043
The hospital has an
impressive firewall.

10:10.653 --> 10:12.568
I'm going to need some time.

10:13.787 --> 10:15.136
Try the New York Ledger.

10:15.179 --> 10:18.792
I read a tiny article
about irregularities

10:18.835 --> 10:20.228
at Crosstown General,
but the article

10:20.271 --> 10:22.012
didn't have a byline.

10:26.887 --> 10:29.672
JULIAN:
The Ledger'smainframe has
a private file with all kinds

10:29.716 --> 10:33.023
of info on the poor care
at Crosstown's E.R.

10:34.459 --> 10:36.810
But none of the articles
have been published.

10:37.811 --> 10:40.422
The info is in the file
of one reporter.

10:41.684 --> 10:43.991
Rebecca Dunmar.

10:44.034 --> 10:45.906
I mostly cover
new tech releases.

10:45.949 --> 10:48.125
My editor says,
before he can put me

10:48.169 --> 10:51.172
on any investigative work,
he needs a slam dunk.

10:51.215 --> 10:54.044
There's been a 20%
uptick in E.R. deaths

10:54.088 --> 10:55.829
over the last year,
and yet he'll say,

10:55.872 --> 10:57.874
"Oh, no, Becca, that
still isn't a story."

10:57.918 --> 10:59.833
The hospital's a
major advertiser,

10:59.876 --> 11:01.051
so my editor is probably afraid

11:01.095 --> 11:02.618
to give Crosstown
any bad publicity.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.707
But let me tell you,

11:04.751 --> 11:07.144
Crosstown General's staff
is careless and incompetent.

11:07.188 --> 11:11.061
Till the story gets out there,
the killing's not going to stop.

11:11.105 --> 11:14.021
You weren't the caller who left
the anonymous tip, were you?

11:14.064 --> 11:15.979
No. My job is
to report the news,

11:16.023 --> 11:17.241
not to make it happen.

11:19.113 --> 11:20.201
If you want to talk
to any of my sources,

11:20.244 --> 11:21.550
I'd be happy to give you
a few names.

11:21.593 --> 11:23.334
That would be helpful.Yeah, um...

11:23.378 --> 11:25.728
try the Taylors--
Derek and Vanessa.

11:25.772 --> 11:27.599
Their story
will break your heart.

11:27.643 --> 11:30.254
They didn't just rob
Vanessa of her life.

11:30.298 --> 11:32.213
They destroyed
Derek's, too.

11:34.128 --> 11:35.433
Vanessa didn't actually die,

11:35.477 --> 11:37.261
but Crosstown certainly
caused her suffering.

11:37.305 --> 11:39.829
She went to the E.R.
with heart palpitations,

11:39.873 --> 11:42.963
and the doctor sent her away
with anxiety medication.

11:43.006 --> 11:45.966
She had hypothyroidism,
not anxiety,

11:46.009 --> 11:48.490
and now it's just tragic.

11:51.101 --> 11:53.495
HARRIS:
Hey, Needham, looks like
you have a visitor.

11:58.108 --> 12:00.850
Pete the Stalker,
look at you all cleaned up.

12:00.894 --> 12:02.025
You look nice.

12:02.069 --> 12:03.157
Thank you.

12:03.200 --> 12:04.288
Actually, turns out

12:04.332 --> 12:06.203
I'm not a stalker.

12:06.247 --> 12:08.075
Um...

12:08.118 --> 12:10.425
I never intended
to scare Maggie.

12:10.468 --> 12:11.687
Okay.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.428
So, what brings you in?

12:13.471 --> 12:15.256
Well, my boss fired me
after the, uh,

12:15.299 --> 12:16.692
incident.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.999
But Linda, the police
psychologist you recommended,

12:19.042 --> 12:20.304
thinks that I am rehabilitated.

12:20.348 --> 12:21.653
In fact, she wrote
a letter of recommendation

12:21.697 --> 12:22.916
to help me get a job.

12:22.959 --> 12:24.831
Good for you, Pete.

12:24.874 --> 12:26.136
She also thought
it might be helpful

12:26.180 --> 12:27.398
if you would sign it.

12:27.442 --> 12:29.574
You want me to help you
find a job?

12:29.618 --> 12:31.663
Great. Thank you.

12:34.884 --> 12:37.234
VANESSA and DEREK:

12:37.278 --> 12:40.107

12:59.300 --> 13:01.171
You sound beautiful.

13:03.173 --> 13:05.785
Your wife had
a left-brain stroke.

13:06.829 --> 13:08.352
11 months ago.

13:08.396 --> 13:10.311
How'd you know?

13:10.354 --> 13:12.966
Music and memorized lyrics

13:13.009 --> 13:15.272
live in a region of the brain
undamaged by aphasia.

13:15.316 --> 13:16.665
That's why your wife

13:16.708 --> 13:19.102
can't talk to you
but can still sing.

13:20.495 --> 13:23.106
I'm Dylan Reinhart
from the NYPD.

13:23.150 --> 13:24.455
I was hoping to ask you

13:24.499 --> 13:25.848
a few questions
about Crosstown General.

13:25.892 --> 13:30.287
If you're here to talk
about that hospital,

13:30.331 --> 13:33.116
ask as many questions
as you want.

13:33.160 --> 13:35.423
A year ago, me and
Vanessa were training

13:35.466 --> 13:37.642
to run the
New York Marathon.

13:37.686 --> 13:39.775
Now I'm pushing my wife
in a wheelchair,

13:39.819 --> 13:42.299
and she's living
in a nursing home.

13:42.343 --> 13:44.475
Dr. Walters misdiagnosed her.

13:44.519 --> 13:47.565
The hospital has a team of
lawyers covering everything up.

13:47.609 --> 13:49.306
Then why do you keep
going back there?

13:49.350 --> 13:51.178
I don't have a choice.

13:51.221 --> 13:53.136
We don't have great
health insurance.

13:53.180 --> 13:55.356
Before Vanessa
got sick,

13:55.399 --> 13:57.706
the two of us were gonna launch
an online startup.

13:57.749 --> 14:01.362
Now... I just make ends meet
as best I can.

14:04.278 --> 14:06.367
Maybe I should be grateful.

14:06.410 --> 14:09.500
At least Vanessa didn't die
like the others.

14:11.328 --> 14:13.417
I think someone at Crosstown

14:13.461 --> 14:16.246
is purposely killing patients.

14:24.254 --> 14:25.821
♪ Yeah

14:29.433 --> 14:31.218
♪ Oh, I'm walking
my own line... ♪

14:32.610 --> 14:34.264
I'm a little scared

14:34.308 --> 14:35.657
for whoever's pissing you off.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.180
:
He must be a jerk.

14:37.224 --> 14:40.096
"He" is my job,
and I like it.

14:41.228 --> 14:43.186
But yeah, it's been rough.

14:43.230 --> 14:44.622
Uh, I'm Jeff.

14:45.710 --> 14:46.973
Hi, Jeff.
Hi.

14:47.016 --> 14:48.235
I'm working out.

14:49.192 --> 14:51.412
Uh, give me two minutes?

14:51.455 --> 14:54.284
I'm on lunch, so you have
45 seconds before my next round.

14:54.328 --> 14:56.373
Yeah, I was hoping to
talk you out of that.

14:56.417 --> 14:57.853
What?

14:57.897 --> 14:59.463
Well, I'm a
personal trainer.

14:59.507 --> 15:00.812
Those burpees that you're doing

15:00.856 --> 15:02.423
are killer on your knees
and lower back.

15:02.466 --> 15:05.730
Even if your
form is perfect.

15:05.774 --> 15:08.211
Here.

15:08.255 --> 15:10.605
And what am I supposed
to do with these, Jeff?

15:10.648 --> 15:13.216
We're gonna do an overhead
tricep extension.

15:13.260 --> 15:15.784
All right

15:15.827 --> 15:18.221
Okay, so you're gonna start
with your arms over your head.

15:18.265 --> 15:20.963
You're gonna bend at the elbows,
keeping your shoulders still.

15:21.007 --> 15:21.964
Like this?

15:22.008 --> 15:23.531
Oh, my God.

15:23.574 --> 15:25.707
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

15:25.750 --> 15:26.708
I'm good, I'm good.

15:26.751 --> 15:27.796
It's okay. I'm good.

15:27.839 --> 15:29.189
Well, what can I do?

15:29.232 --> 15:30.581
Oh, God.Uh, well, I was gonna...

15:30.625 --> 15:32.409
I was gonna ask you
for your phone number.

15:33.889 --> 15:36.370
Kind of hard to say no
to me now, huh?

15:36.413 --> 15:39.242
Yeah... yeah, it is. Uh...

15:39.286 --> 15:41.462
Uh...

15:41.505 --> 15:43.464
Oh, no.

15:43.507 --> 15:45.988
God, I'm sorry.
It's okay.

15:46.032 --> 15:47.772
Elizabeth Needham.

15:47.816 --> 15:49.383
Detective.

15:49.426 --> 15:52.038
Does the NYPD
let you carry a gun?

15:52.081 --> 15:53.996
You're practically a deadly
weapon all on your own.

15:58.087 --> 15:59.784
You find anything?

15:59.828 --> 16:01.308
Uh, I shouldn't work out
during lunch.

16:01.351 --> 16:02.439
What happened?
Ugh.

16:02.483 --> 16:04.659
I met a guy and gave
him a bloody nose.

16:04.702 --> 16:06.269
He asked me out.Of course he did.

16:06.313 --> 16:08.054
He's a trainer.

16:08.097 --> 16:09.751
Ah, I'll give you
the story later.

16:09.794 --> 16:11.318
I filed the subpoena.

16:11.361 --> 16:12.493
Waiting to hear back.

16:12.536 --> 16:13.537
You get anything?

16:13.581 --> 16:15.278
As a matter of
fact, I did.

16:15.322 --> 16:18.934
I think Crosstown Hospital
has an angel of death.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.109
An angel of death

16:20.153 --> 16:21.371
Derek says he
feels someone

16:21.415 --> 16:23.243
in the E.R. is trying
to kill patients.

16:23.286 --> 16:24.896
And you think
it's Nurse Albany?

16:24.940 --> 16:26.463
Well, we saw the way
she treated people.

16:26.507 --> 16:28.726
And she transferred from Oregon
a year ago.

16:28.770 --> 16:31.294
Right before the uptick
in patients dying.

16:31.338 --> 16:32.904
Yes.

16:32.948 --> 16:34.994
How'd you find that out
so quickly?

16:36.473 --> 16:38.301
Oh, never mind.
I don't want to know.

16:38.345 --> 16:39.911
Oregon is a
right-to-die state.

16:39.955 --> 16:42.044
You do realize
that Death with Dignity

16:42.088 --> 16:44.046
is not the same as murder?I do.

16:44.090 --> 16:46.309
But if our killer's M.O.
is poison by administering

16:46.353 --> 16:48.311
either too much
or too little medication...

16:48.355 --> 16:50.183
Don't get ahead of yourself
with the poison theory.

16:50.226 --> 16:53.012
We're still waiting on the
tox results to confirm C.O.D.

16:53.055 --> 16:54.404
JASMINE:
Lizzie, remember, I need you

16:54.448 --> 16:55.797
to get those
after-action reports.

16:55.840 --> 16:57.320
On it, on it.

16:57.364 --> 17:00.584
Okay, tell me your theories--
the credible ones--

17:00.628 --> 17:02.760
while I go
through these reports.

17:02.804 --> 17:05.633
Well, it may be
that our angel of death...

17:05.676 --> 17:07.417
Possible angel of death.

17:07.461 --> 17:08.897
...isn't motivated
by a moral compass.

17:08.940 --> 17:10.812
They don't have any mercy.

17:10.855 --> 17:13.423
They want to kill
rather than care for

17:13.467 --> 17:15.860
annoying or demanding patients.

17:15.904 --> 17:17.514
It's also may be
that these patients' deaths

17:17.558 --> 17:19.125
were tragic medical misfortunes.

17:19.168 --> 17:20.909
When someone dies unexpectedly
in a hospital,

17:20.952 --> 17:22.302
people want someone to blame.

17:22.345 --> 17:24.304
They can't blame God
or fate, so...

17:24.347 --> 17:26.610
they blame their nurse
or doctor.

17:26.654 --> 17:29.918
You're being very protective
of the hospital institution.

17:29.961 --> 17:33.139
The hospital institution
saves lives.

17:38.535 --> 17:42.322
Okay, I'm not an expert
in human behavior, but...

17:42.365 --> 17:43.453
something's eating at you.

17:43.497 --> 17:44.759
I know that you hate hospitals,

17:44.802 --> 17:48.154
but this
seems personal.

17:48.197 --> 17:51.592
Okay, we don't have
to talk about it.

17:53.333 --> 17:56.336
When I was in sixth grade,
my mom was in a cancer ward.

17:56.379 --> 17:58.773
I'd go visit her
after school.

17:58.816 --> 18:01.689
Sixth grade? I'm so sorry.

18:01.732 --> 18:05.736
I remember one
of my mom's caregivers,

18:05.780 --> 18:07.260
Janet...

18:07.303 --> 18:09.479
she was giving Mom a bath

18:09.523 --> 18:11.829
after one of
her surgeries, and...

18:11.873 --> 18:16.269
the washcloth turned orange
with all the iodine, and...

18:18.009 --> 18:20.403
Janet said that Mom looked
like an orange Oompa Loompa.

18:24.451 --> 18:26.279
And my mom
couldn't stop laughing

18:26.322 --> 18:29.760
even though it hurt
because of all the stitches.

18:29.804 --> 18:32.154
I spent way
too much time

18:32.198 --> 18:34.113
in hospitals when I
was a kid, so yes,

18:34.156 --> 18:36.463
I do-- I hate them.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.684
But Janet was kind.

18:40.728 --> 18:44.819
I never would have wanted Albany
to take care of my mom.

18:46.473 --> 18:49.040
Okay. We'll look at everybody
in the hospital,

18:49.084 --> 18:50.433
starting with Nurse Albany.

18:52.957 --> 18:55.046
Elizabeth Needham?Uh-huh.

18:55.090 --> 18:57.136
I have something for you.

18:58.876 --> 19:00.878
You've just been served.

19:06.493 --> 19:09.278
The trainer I met
in the park...

19:09.322 --> 19:11.628
he's suing me for
personal injury.

19:11.672 --> 19:13.761
What?He says I intentionally
hurt him.

19:13.804 --> 19:15.676
But he approached me.

19:15.719 --> 19:17.591
He wants compensatory
and punitive damages?

19:17.634 --> 19:20.202
Look, don't worry.
Uh, talk to Andy.

19:20.246 --> 19:22.030
Your husband owns a bar.
You think I need a drink?

19:22.073 --> 19:23.423
Well, it wouldn't hurt.

19:23.466 --> 19:25.033
But Andy used to work
for a fancy law firm.

19:25.076 --> 19:26.295
I bet he can help.

19:26.339 --> 19:27.731
HARRIS:
Tox report came back.

19:27.775 --> 19:30.212
Theo died of
a morphine overdose.

19:30.256 --> 19:32.127
Nurse Albany is the one
who hooked him up

19:32.171 --> 19:33.433
to that morphine drip.

19:33.476 --> 19:34.608
And she's on
administrative review.

19:34.651 --> 19:36.305
You may be right.

19:36.349 --> 19:38.220
And if Albany
is the angel of death,

19:38.264 --> 19:39.787
the killing isn't gonna stop.

19:55.977 --> 19:57.848
LIZZIE :
There's Dr. Walters.

20:08.642 --> 20:10.557
They're working together?

20:11.775 --> 20:13.690
Come on.

20:52.512 --> 20:54.731
Oh, boy.

20:54.775 --> 20:57.821
I hope you're both going to
scrub thoroughly after this.

21:00.694 --> 21:03.436
So, what, you gonna
arrest us for a quickie?

21:03.479 --> 21:06.830
What do you know about the
unexplained deaths in the E.R.?

21:08.223 --> 21:09.790
Hannah, tell them
what you think.

21:11.661 --> 21:13.054
There is a problem
at Crosstown General,

21:13.097 --> 21:15.230
and it isn't
with the staff.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.624
It's with
the administrator.

21:17.667 --> 21:20.670
The only thing admin cares about
is their financial bottom line.

21:20.714 --> 21:22.455
That is what's killing patients.

21:22.498 --> 21:25.153
Meaning what?I'm doing the work
of four nurses.

21:25.196 --> 21:26.763
Unless a patient has
top-tier health insurance,

21:26.807 --> 21:28.983
I'm barely allowed to spend
three minutes with them.

21:29.026 --> 21:32.726
Reilly is on my butt, saying,
"Treat 'em and street 'em."

21:32.769 --> 21:34.162
WALTERS:
Reilly's the
administrator.

21:34.205 --> 21:36.643
He wants us to turn over
the beds as fast as possible.

21:36.686 --> 21:37.992
I have complained a lot.

21:38.035 --> 21:39.994
Which is the real
reason he put her

21:40.037 --> 21:41.604
on administrative review.

21:41.648 --> 21:43.693
Reilly's trying to shut you up?

21:45.652 --> 21:47.784
What exactly
did you complain about?

21:50.961 --> 21:54.748
For starters, the I.V. pumps
keep malfunctioning.

21:54.791 --> 21:59.187
They go down, and no one
can tell how or why.

21:59.230 --> 22:02.190
DYLAN: Why did that service dog
start barking?

22:02.233 --> 22:05.280
ALBANY: Code blue in the E.R.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.673
Code blue in Emergency.

22:09.719 --> 22:11.808
The I.V. pumps you
complained to Reilly about--

22:11.852 --> 22:13.636
was Theo Burton hooked
up to one of them?

22:13.680 --> 22:15.638
Yeah.

22:15.682 --> 22:17.379
It got sent to the
machine room to be fixed.

22:17.423 --> 22:20.643
If you wait two weeks,
it'll be back on the floor.

22:20.687 --> 22:22.819
I'd like to see one now. Good luck.

22:22.863 --> 22:24.430
Everything's
locked up down there.

22:24.473 --> 22:26.127
They don't want anyone
getting near that stuff.

22:26.170 --> 22:27.346
Why not?

22:28.608 --> 22:30.261
Your suspect is not
the first person

22:30.305 --> 22:32.089
that Crosstown Hospital
murdered.

22:33.743 --> 22:35.615
Nurse Albany, are you
the one who called

22:35.658 --> 22:37.834
and tipped us off?

22:37.878 --> 22:39.270
"Your suspect is not
the first person

22:39.314 --> 22:40.707
Crosstown Hospital
has murdered."

22:41.751 --> 22:43.579
Those were
almost identical

22:43.623 --> 22:44.885
to the words the
whistle-blower used.

22:44.928 --> 22:46.582
I don't think that's
a coincidence.

22:48.410 --> 22:50.934
I tried to get
the administration to change,

22:50.978 --> 22:52.719
but they won't.

22:52.762 --> 22:55.112
Me? I'm powerless.

22:55.156 --> 22:58.507
I was hoping you might
do the right thing.

22:59.552 --> 23:00.727
Okay. Thank you.

23:00.770 --> 23:01.815
You can go.

23:05.209 --> 23:07.342
So, what do you want to do?

23:07.386 --> 23:08.865
We're not breaking
into the machine room.

23:08.909 --> 23:10.650
No.

23:10.693 --> 23:12.913
No, we're not.

23:15.872 --> 23:17.439
LIZZIE:
Andy, I don't get it.

23:17.483 --> 23:19.310
How could this guy, Jeff,

23:19.354 --> 23:22.139
who was flirting with me,
turn around and sue me?

23:22.183 --> 23:25.055
I gave up trying to understand
why people do things.

23:25.099 --> 23:26.622
Dylan's the psychologist.

23:26.666 --> 23:28.189
That's his sweet spot.

23:28.232 --> 23:29.930
I'm only an attorney.

23:29.973 --> 23:34.151
You two definitely are one of
those opposites-attract couples.

23:34.195 --> 23:38.591
That's true, though I'm not sure
anyone is really like Dylan.

23:39.809 --> 23:42.203
Andy, this guy, Jeff,
totally tricked me.

23:42.246 --> 23:44.118
I promise everything's
gonna be okay, all right?

23:44.161 --> 23:46.729
Take a breath.
Tell me what happened.

23:46.773 --> 23:49.645
He was standing
behind me, and I...

23:49.689 --> 23:51.517
I guess I hit him
with a dumbbell.

23:51.560 --> 23:52.779
I didn't know that...

23:52.822 --> 23:54.520
How'd you know
he was behind you?

23:54.563 --> 23:56.739
Because I could feel him
breathing down my neck.

23:56.783 --> 23:58.045
So you were annoyed at him.

23:58.088 --> 23:59.568
Maybe that's why
you intentionally hit him.

23:59.612 --> 24:01.091
I didn't intentionally hit him.
I told you, I...

24:01.135 --> 24:03.703
Seems you have a temper.I don't have a temper.

24:03.746 --> 24:05.531
I...
You sure?

24:05.574 --> 24:07.663
You're testing me.

24:10.405 --> 24:12.233
This is a
"he said, she said" case,

24:12.276 --> 24:14.627
which means it's all about
likability here, all right?

24:14.670 --> 24:16.455
There's no witnesses, so your...

24:16.498 --> 24:18.935
your tone is gonna be
vitally important.

24:18.979 --> 24:20.894
So, the fact that I'm telling
the truth and he's lying...

24:20.937 --> 24:22.461
Come on, you know how it is.

24:22.504 --> 24:23.984
The system is built
in such a way

24:24.027 --> 24:25.594
that the truth
doesn't always win out.

24:27.378 --> 24:28.989
I'll look into it for you.

24:33.384 --> 24:35.256
MAN:
Thank you, Detective.

24:56.843 --> 24:58.671
Between the cold
and the stench,

24:58.714 --> 25:00.586
you owe me
double for this.

25:00.629 --> 25:02.805
So, what exactly
am I doing here?

25:02.849 --> 25:04.938
Right before
Theo Burton O.D.'d,

25:04.981 --> 25:07.331
a Chihuahua barked
at an I.V. pump.

25:07.375 --> 25:09.943
And dogs can hear things
that humans can't.

25:09.986 --> 25:11.901
Mm

25:11.945 --> 25:13.163
Well, that's what I hope

25:13.207 --> 25:14.991
you're going to
help me figure out.

25:30.877 --> 25:33.401
Yo, step off, man.

25:33.444 --> 25:35.925
I am stepping off.
Many apologies.

26:02.778 --> 26:04.780
♪

26:16.096 --> 26:21.318
The place where old machines
and fresh evidence go to die.

26:21.362 --> 26:23.190
These I.V. pumps
aren't connected

26:23.233 --> 26:25.061
to the Internet
or Wi-Fi,

26:25.105 --> 26:26.541
so what are you...?

26:32.329 --> 26:34.984
Your killer reversed the
polarity of the magnet

26:35.028 --> 26:37.073
inside that
pump's speaker.

26:37.117 --> 26:38.858
What, turning it
into a device

26:38.901 --> 26:41.861
that listens for sound
instead of creating it?

26:41.904 --> 26:44.385
Yes, and that
machine was hacked.

26:44.428 --> 26:47.910
They used sound
to reprogram a pump?

26:47.954 --> 26:50.043
JULIAN: The killer used
an inaudible sound frequency

26:50.086 --> 26:51.653
to deliver the malware.

26:51.697 --> 26:53.089
How?

26:53.133 --> 26:56.136
My guess is something
as simple as a cell phone

26:56.179 --> 26:58.486
was used to trigger the attacks,

26:58.529 --> 27:00.357
enabling whoever
did this to work

27:00.401 --> 27:02.490
on the fly, unnoticed.

27:02.533 --> 27:04.927
And make them
more difficult to find.

27:04.971 --> 27:08.583
So, could we
bait the hacker,

27:08.627 --> 27:09.802
draw them out?

27:09.845 --> 27:11.455
We can try.

27:11.499 --> 27:14.458
I'll ping the malware server
and send a message.

27:14.502 --> 27:16.591
Compliment the sophistication
of their code

27:16.635 --> 27:19.028
and propose a partnership.

27:19.072 --> 27:21.422
Someone is transforming
medical devices

27:21.465 --> 27:24.033
into murder weapons.

27:31.345 --> 27:33.652
The malware attacked
the I.V. machine's pump,

27:33.695 --> 27:35.871
causing it to dump
huge amounts of drugs

27:35.915 --> 27:38.265
into those poor
patients' systems.

27:38.308 --> 27:40.963
So a tech genius
is our angel of death?

27:41.007 --> 27:42.138
Didn't you say that Derek...

27:42.182 --> 27:43.836
Was in the process
of launching

27:43.879 --> 27:45.794
an online startup
when Vanessa got sick.

27:45.838 --> 27:48.188
So yes, he has
the computer know-how.

27:48.231 --> 27:49.711
Certainly has the motive.

27:49.755 --> 27:52.496
He did show signs
of depression and stifled rage.

27:52.540 --> 27:54.063
But if he were caught,

27:54.107 --> 27:55.891
there'd be no one to
take care of Vanessa.

27:55.935 --> 27:57.893
He seemed incredibly devoted.Mmm.

28:00.809 --> 28:03.072
A list of recent deaths
at Crosstown E.R.,

28:03.116 --> 28:05.684
along with patient
background info.

28:05.727 --> 28:07.468
Where'd you get this?

28:07.511 --> 28:09.731
Don't ask.

28:09.775 --> 28:12.168
So, apart from
being killed by an I.V. pump,

28:12.212 --> 28:13.909
did these patients
have anything else in common?

28:13.953 --> 28:16.129
Almost all of them
had inadequate

28:16.172 --> 28:17.783
or no health insurance.

28:17.826 --> 28:19.654
That fits with what
I dug up on Reilly.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.917
Crosstown's administration
has their bonuses tied

28:21.961 --> 28:23.484
to the hospital's stock price.

28:23.527 --> 28:25.878
Mmm, a good incentive
to keep earnings high.

28:25.921 --> 28:28.184
Which would make him keep
patients' deaths quiet.

28:28.228 --> 28:30.012
Do you really
think Reilly

28:30.056 --> 28:32.406
would intentionally
murder patients?

28:32.449 --> 28:33.886
He's a businessman.

28:33.929 --> 28:35.801
That is bad business.

28:35.844 --> 28:37.759
Mmm.

28:41.545 --> 28:43.156
I'm setting up
a rendezvous

28:43.199 --> 28:45.027
with the hacker,
letting 'em know there are

28:45.071 --> 28:47.377
other hospitals that need
to be brought to justice

28:47.421 --> 28:48.727
for mistreating patients.

DYLAN:
I'll be in your ear.

28:56.778 --> 28:58.258
Remember, it's not enough
for the hacker

28:58.301 --> 28:59.912
to admit to designing
the malware.

28:59.955 --> 29:02.001
He has to...We need a confession
that the malware

29:02.044 --> 29:04.046
was intentionally used to kill.
I know.

29:04.090 --> 29:05.221
How's the level?

29:06.309 --> 29:07.528
Hey, Needham.

29:07.571 --> 29:09.051
Knock 'em dead.

Hopefully,
it won't come to that.

If I were to use malware
to attack Crosstown General

I wouldn't do it for money.

Why are you really here?

30:55.636 --> 30:57.159
Make it personal.

31:35.415 --> 31:36.982
Dad.

31:39.288 --> 31:40.724
The doctor.

31:42.291 --> 31:44.424
Tell her you didn't want
to give up on your mom.

31:44.467 --> 31:47.514
LIZZIE: I never wanted
to give up on her,

31:47.557 --> 31:50.125
but the doctor was
too busy to care.

31:50.169 --> 31:51.344
I hate hospitals.

31:51.387 --> 31:53.476
We trust them to
take care of us,

31:53.520 --> 31:55.478
but what are we
supposed to do

31:55.522 --> 31:58.438
when they kill our loved
ones and cover it up?

32:00.962 --> 32:02.703
If you and I were
to team up...

32:02.746 --> 32:04.139
We could really
do something.

32:14.019 --> 32:16.238
Come on, Becca.

32:16.282 --> 32:18.240
Confess.

32:22.505 --> 32:24.681
Okay, let's do it.

32:26.031 --> 32:27.902
Big attack.

32:27.946 --> 32:30.600
We could take down every
corrupt hospital in Manhattan.

32:33.342 --> 32:35.866
Meet me here
at noon tomorrow.

32:37.129 --> 32:39.522
So, this is personal
for you, too?

32:39.566 --> 32:41.437
For me?

32:41.481 --> 32:43.657
No.

32:43.700 --> 32:45.833
For me, it's political.

32:56.539 --> 32:58.628
Okay, let's bring the lieutenant
up to speed

32:58.672 --> 33:00.500
and get a team in place
for tomorrow.

33:00.543 --> 33:02.676
Tell her we'll need
a few undercovers as well.

33:02.719 --> 33:04.286
She's lying.
We should bring her in.

33:04.330 --> 33:05.635
HARRIS:
She didn't confess,

33:05.679 --> 33:06.941
but she implicated herself.

33:06.985 --> 33:09.422
Dylan, we can't cuff Becca
with just this.

33:09.465 --> 33:12.686
No, she's lying about this being
political and not personal.

33:17.038 --> 33:19.171
DYLAN:
There's something else
going on.

33:21.173 --> 33:23.827
"Wedding announcement."

33:25.568 --> 33:28.093
Becca was in the process
of planning a wedding.

33:28.136 --> 33:29.964
She wore an engagement ring.

33:31.270 --> 33:33.098
I think Becca's fiancé might be

33:33.141 --> 33:35.665
on this list of patients
who died in the E.R.

33:35.709 --> 33:39.626
Let me see if I can find out
who she was engaged to.

33:39.669 --> 33:41.758
If this is personal for Becca...

33:41.802 --> 33:43.369
And she knows we're onto her,

33:43.412 --> 33:44.935
she may go straight
to the hospital

33:44.979 --> 33:47.503
to get revenge on the people
who killed her fiancé.

33:47.547 --> 33:48.809
Her fiancé died.

33:49.679 --> 33:50.637
At Crosstown.

33:50.680 --> 33:52.595
We gotta get
to the hospital now.

34:10.744 --> 34:12.224
Don't move.

34:12.267 --> 34:14.226
Police. Police.Everyone, give
this woman space.

34:16.010 --> 34:18.012
Becca...Leave me alone.

34:19.622 --> 34:21.407
I know what happened
to your fiancé.

34:24.671 --> 34:27.978
This hospital took Carl
from you.

34:28.022 --> 34:31.417
He should never have died
in this E.R.

34:31.460 --> 34:32.809
BECCA:
You don't get it.

34:32.853 --> 34:34.202
Carl was everything.

34:34.246 --> 34:36.857
And now it feels like half
of you is missing.

34:36.900 --> 34:39.642
I get it.

34:39.686 --> 34:42.428
I lost the love of my life, too.

34:47.607 --> 34:50.914
After he died, I...

34:50.958 --> 34:52.960
I couldn't function.

34:55.093 --> 34:57.486
Then, one day,
I stopped crying.

34:57.530 --> 34:59.836
I got angry.

34:59.880 --> 35:01.621
You wanted justice.

35:07.148 --> 35:08.845
I'm not a killer.

35:11.370 --> 35:12.588
They made me this way.

35:12.632 --> 35:13.894
It's their fault.

35:13.937 --> 35:15.939
This hospital killed him!

35:15.983 --> 35:18.246
And they will be punished.No.

35:18.290 --> 35:20.248
They're too big.
They're too powerful.

35:20.292 --> 35:21.423
They'll get away with it.

35:21.467 --> 35:22.990
DYLAN:
What if they don't?

35:25.079 --> 35:28.517
Becca, I know this hospital
misdiagnosed

35:28.561 --> 35:30.128
your fiancé's illness

35:30.171 --> 35:31.433
and Vanessa's illness.

35:31.477 --> 35:35.350
And I have proof
they tried to cover it up.

35:37.657 --> 35:39.093
How?

35:39.137 --> 35:40.703
Institutions
are very powerful,

35:40.747 --> 35:43.184
but they're also
very bureaucratic.

35:43.228 --> 35:45.578
They keep records
of everything.

35:45.621 --> 35:47.493
I tried to get
those records.

35:47.536 --> 35:50.496
I sued to get
those records.

35:50.539 --> 35:52.150
I used other means.

35:54.717 --> 35:59.200
You will pay a heavy price,
but you will have your justice.

36:19.568 --> 36:21.004
It's okay.

36:22.092 --> 36:23.703
It's okay.

36:25.966 --> 36:28.098
Come here. It's okay.

36:32.581 --> 36:34.017
The hospital has
already begun

36:34.061 --> 36:36.019
the paperwork for
settling your case.

36:36.063 --> 36:37.586
With the money,
I'll be able to get

36:37.630 --> 36:39.719
much better care
for Vanessa.

36:39.762 --> 36:41.416
And there's some new
research on the effects

36:41.460 --> 36:43.810
of music therapy for
stroke survivors.

36:43.853 --> 36:45.246
Under a neurologist's
supervision

36:45.290 --> 36:47.248
and with proper rehab,

36:47.292 --> 36:50.512
Vanessa could show
signs of improvement.

36:51.774 --> 36:53.733
Thank you.

36:53.776 --> 36:55.474
LIZZIE:
Of course.

36:57.650 --> 36:59.478
You two closed that case
quickly.

36:59.521 --> 37:00.609
Good work.

37:00.653 --> 37:02.350
I'm turning my
case folder over

37:02.394 --> 37:03.612
to the attorney general.

37:03.656 --> 37:05.701
Crosstown Hospital's
being investigated.

37:05.745 --> 37:08.661
Can I ask who
gave you the proof

37:08.704 --> 37:11.533
about Vanessa's misdiagnosis
and Becca's fiancé?

37:11.577 --> 37:13.927
Yes, you can ask.

37:13.970 --> 37:15.972
Mmm.

37:16.016 --> 37:19.933
Too bad Becca made
all the wrong choices.

37:19.976 --> 37:21.761
You feel bad for her.

37:21.804 --> 37:22.892
I do.

37:22.936 --> 37:24.285
JASMINE:
Oh, Detective, you did forget

37:24.329 --> 37:25.939
to put one thing
in the report.

37:25.982 --> 37:27.680
I did? I don't think so.

37:27.723 --> 37:29.595
Yeah, you forgot
to report your overtime.

37:29.638 --> 37:30.857
According to
hospital records,

37:30.900 --> 37:32.467
you signed in
around midnight,

37:32.511 --> 37:35.209
I assume to get to one
of the compromised machines?

37:36.254 --> 37:37.994
Right.

37:42.477 --> 37:45.045
Give me back
my dupe shield now.

37:45.088 --> 37:46.829
I really need a badge.

37:46.873 --> 37:48.614
You can get a badge.I can?

37:48.657 --> 37:49.919
Yeah.
When?

37:49.963 --> 37:52.618
Right after you graduate
from the police academy.

37:58.058 --> 38:00.016
MAN:
You're a public servant,

38:00.060 --> 38:02.192
so we don't want to
drag you to court.

38:02.236 --> 38:04.673
So my client is willing
to settle this case

38:04.717 --> 38:07.241
right here today for,
say, a hundred thousand.

38:07.285 --> 38:08.677
A hundred thousand dollars?

38:10.723 --> 38:13.769
For bruising your ego?

38:15.380 --> 38:18.078
I don't have
a hundred thousand dollars.

38:18.121 --> 38:19.949
Here's what I'm gonna do.

38:19.993 --> 38:23.823
I'm gonna set you up on
a nice payment plan.

38:26.913 --> 38:29.742
Forgive my tardiness,
gentlemen, Ms. Needham.

38:29.785 --> 38:31.787
I'm coming from
a board meeting downtown.

38:34.442 --> 38:36.401
That's your firm?
Uh-huh.

38:36.444 --> 38:37.880
Voted one of the Top Ten

38:37.924 --> 38:39.404
Most Prestigious Law Firms
in America.

38:39.447 --> 38:41.144
Yeah, I read
about that.Okay, look.

38:41.188 --> 38:42.972
Uh, I have to be at an
event in 30 minutes,

38:43.016 --> 38:44.539
so I'm gonna need
to keep this brief.

38:44.583 --> 38:46.759
Your client, Jeff
Johnson, has obscenely

38:46.802 --> 38:47.803
exaggerated his injuries.

38:47.847 --> 38:49.718
And, Mr. Traub,
your naked grab

38:49.762 --> 38:51.633
for excessive
monetary damages

38:51.677 --> 38:53.505
has so upset my client
and personal friend

38:53.548 --> 38:54.680
that I have decided
to countersue

38:54.723 --> 38:56.072
on Ms. Needham's behalf.

39:00.468 --> 39:02.252
They dropped the lawsuit.Yay!

39:02.296 --> 39:05.386
Turns out Jeff has done
this a dozen times before.

39:05.430 --> 39:07.649
It's a scam he's
got down cold.

39:07.693 --> 39:09.912
Also happens to be
Traub's brother-in-law.

39:09.956 --> 39:11.871
Oh, so they're keeping it
in the family.

39:11.914 --> 39:13.263
Well, well done.

39:13.307 --> 39:15.701
Also, you look mighty fine
in that suit, sir.

39:15.744 --> 39:18.094
Ugh, forgot how much
I hate putting these on.

39:18.138 --> 39:19.922
I was lucky to have you, Andy.

39:19.966 --> 39:21.881
If you hadn't been there,
Traub would've buried me.

39:21.924 --> 39:23.665
Thank you.

39:23.709 --> 39:26.146
Just glad my law degree
came in handy for someone.

39:26.189 --> 39:29.279
Vanessa and Derek had no one
to stand up for them.

39:29.323 --> 39:31.456
Neither did Becca.No.

39:31.499 --> 39:33.458
Fighting a losing battle
against a Goliath

39:33.501 --> 39:35.634
just pushed her
over the edge.

39:35.677 --> 39:37.113
Those Goliaths can be vicious.

39:37.157 --> 39:38.724
They certainly can.

39:38.767 --> 39:40.508
You just gotta find
a bigger Goliath.

39:40.552 --> 39:41.901
Is this what you guys
talk about when you're

39:41.944 --> 39:43.642
alone together
all day

39:43.685 --> 39:45.034
'Cause I've had my
moments of being jealous

39:45.078 --> 39:46.558
in the past, but not
so much anymore.

39:46.601 --> 39:48.734
I told you,
police work is boring.

39:48.777 --> 39:51.563
Oh, yeah, especially since
I've been working with Dylan.
