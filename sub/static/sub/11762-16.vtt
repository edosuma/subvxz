WEBVTT

00:03.474 --> 00:05.005
(whispers) SHE'S MY AGE.

00:05.005 --> 00:07.678
DO YOU REALLY THINK
SHE'S GONNA BUY THIS PLACE?

00:07.678 --> 00:10.681
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU HOW TO CLOSE
ON A 28-YEAR-OLD.

00:10.681 --> 00:13.584
HEY, BETH, LET ME BREAK THIS
DOWN FOR YOU, OKAY?

00:13.584 --> 00:16.187
YOU'RE YOUNG,
YOU GOT A GOOD CAREER GOING.

00:16.187 --> 00:18.519
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE READY
TO LEAP INTO ADULTHOOD.

00:18.519 --> 00:21.522
BUT THAT'S HARD TO DO WHEN YOU
STILL HAVE TO LABEL YOUR FOOD

00:21.522 --> 00:24.695
SO YOUR "ROOMIE"
DOESN'T STEAL IT.
SO TRUE.

00:24.695 --> 00:26.697
IT'S LIKE SHE DOESN'T GET

00:26.697 --> 00:30.231
WHAT "BITCH, DON'T TOUCH
MY PIZZA ROLLS" MEANS.
MM-HMM. YEAH.

00:30.231 --> 00:33.534
BETH, DON'T YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR
GROWN-UP LIFE SHOULD START HERE?
MM.

00:33.534 --> 00:36.167
I MEAN, I COULD SEE YOU
DRINKING WINE OVER THERE

00:36.167 --> 00:37.708
AFTER YOU GOT ENGAGED

00:37.708 --> 00:41.212
OR SITTING QUIETLY ON
THE BALCONY AFTER YOUR MOM DIES.

00:41.212 --> 00:43.244
(under breath)
WHY'D I GO SO DARK?

00:43.244 --> 00:45.246
(normal voice)
WELL, I CAN'T HELP IT,

00:45.246 --> 00:47.248
BECAUSE THIS PLACE IS REAL.

00:47.248 --> 00:50.050
I MEAN, THIS IS A HOME.
THIS IS YOUR HOME.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.352
YEAH.
YES.

00:51.352 --> 00:54.425
PLUS, THEY REDID THE CARPET,

00:54.425 --> 00:57.828
SINCE THE PREVIOUS OWNER
WAS BRUTALLY MURDERED.

00:57.828 --> 00:59.330
YEAH, LOTS OF BLOOD.

00:59.330 --> 01:00.561
WHAT?

01:00.561 --> 01:03.134
(laughs)
LOOK AT JENNY JOKESTER.

01:03.134 --> 01:07.138
(under breath) WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?
(whispering) JULES,
I WANT THIS PLACE.

01:07.138 --> 01:10.671
REALLY?
I WANNA BE A GROWN-UP SO BAD.

01:10.671 --> 01:12.673
OH, MY GOD.
IT'S FINALLY HAPPENED.

01:12.673 --> 01:15.506
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.
(squeals)

01:15.506 --> 01:17.508
WHY IS THIS CUPBOARD LOCKED?

01:17.508 --> 01:21.412
(whispering) THAT'S WHERE
THEY FOUND THE HEAD.
OH.

01:21.412 --> 01:24.115
YEAH. HORRIBLE.

01:25.416 --> 01:27.418
OH, WHAT UP, READING GLASSES?

01:27.418 --> 01:30.421
YOU GET THOSE
FOR YOUR 1,000th BIRTHDAY?
YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE

01:30.421 --> 01:33.424
THAT FINDS MY DETERIORATING
EYESIGHT AMUSING.
NUH-UNH. COME ON, J-BIRD.

01:33.424 --> 01:36.427
WHAT'D WE USE TO CALL ELLIE
WHEN SHE HAD THAT FAKE TAN?

01:36.427 --> 01:38.129
UH, THIN? BEAUTIFUL?

01:38.129 --> 01:39.470
I-I-I DON'T REMEMBER.

01:39.470 --> 01:42.603
CHESTER CHEETAH. BLAMMO!
(laughs)

01:42.603 --> 01:44.605
YOU WERE ORANGE.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.137
I WAS GLOWING.

01:46.137 --> 01:48.479
OH, EASE UP, ELLIE.

01:48.479 --> 01:50.481
WE'RE FRIENDS.
FRIENDS ZING EACH OTHER!

01:50.481 --> 01:52.483
OH! WE ARE NOT FRIENDS.

01:52.483 --> 01:55.486
HUMAN BEINGS CANNOT BE FRIENDS
WITH CHIMPS.
SURE, THEY CAN.

01:55.486 --> 01:59.450
MY BUDDY DARRYL WAS BEST FRIENDS
WITH HIS CHIMP BINKY.
THAT'S TRUE.
UNTIL BINKY TURNED 6,

01:59.450 --> 02:03.524
AND THEN HE GOT ANGRY ONE DAY
AND RIPPED OFF DARRYL'S NARDS.
YEAH, THEY'RE STILL FRIENDS,

02:03.524 --> 02:07.398
BUT THEY'RE JUST
NOT BEST FRIENDS.

02:07.398 --> 02:09.300
(cell phone rings)
HELLO?

02:09.300 --> 02:11.302
WHAT UP, "GREY'S ANATOMY"?

02:11.302 --> 02:14.705
GREAT SHOW, BY THE WAY.
NOT ASHAMED TO SAY IT.
You're preachin' to the choir.

02:14.705 --> 02:17.908
ANYWAY, WHAT'S UP?
I JUST WON 200 BUCKS
IN MY BASKETBALL POOL, BABY.

02:17.908 --> 02:20.711
WHAT SHOULD WE DO?
HOW ABOUT YOU COME OVER HERE,

02:20.711 --> 02:22.713
AND WE'LL PAY OFF
YOUR GIANT BAR TAB?

02:22.713 --> 02:24.375
(laughs) COME ON, MAN.

02:24.375 --> 02:26.747
THAT TAB'S NOT REAL.
IT'S JUST NUMBERS.

02:26.747 --> 02:29.320
RIGHT NOW, YOU CAN
CONSIDER THAT MONEY MINE.

02:29.320 --> 02:30.751
OH, MAN!

02:30.751 --> 02:32.483
(cans rattle, loud bang)

02:32.483 --> 02:34.525
HELLO?

02:34.525 --> 02:35.726
HELLO?

02:35.726 --> 02:37.228
HI.

02:37.228 --> 02:38.889
(laughs) HEY.

02:38.889 --> 02:41.592
WHEW! SORRY, MA'AM. I JUST--
I'M HOLDING A LOT OF CASH,

02:41.592 --> 02:44.495
AND I THOUGHT YOU WERE
ABOUT TO ROLL ME.
YOU THOUGHT RIGHT.

02:44.495 --> 02:46.537
OH, FUDGE.
(whack)

02:46.537 --> 02:49.940
THANKS AGAIN FOR GOING OVER
MY FINANCES WITH ME.

02:49.940 --> 02:51.542
NO PROBLEM.

02:51.542 --> 02:54.905
YOU BUY A LOT OF TUNA MELTS
AND BREATH MINTS.

02:54.905 --> 02:57.778
IT'S A VICIOUS CYCLE.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.780
(chuckles) LAURIE,
YOU ARE WAY TOO OLD

02:59.780 --> 03:02.413
TO HAVE PICTURES OF ACTORS
ON YOUR FOLDER.

03:02.413 --> 03:05.286
OOH, BUT LOOK AT HIS ABS. IF HE
WAS, LIKE, TWO YEARS OLDER...

03:05.286 --> 03:07.788
(clicks tongue)
ALL RIGHT, FINE. FIVE YEARS.

03:07.788 --> 03:09.920
TRY 20.
IS HE 8?

03:09.920 --> 03:12.923
NO. ZAC EFRON TURNED 22
ON OCTOBER 18th.

03:12.923 --> 03:15.466
WHAT?
I GOOGLED HIM LAST NIGHT.

03:15.466 --> 03:17.398
WHY?

03:17.398 --> 03:21.902
MRS. ZAC EFRON.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.604
NO REASON.

03:23.604 --> 03:26.477
ANYWAY, LAURIE, YOU CAN
ABSOLUTELY AFFORD THIS CONDO.

03:26.477 --> 03:28.239
THERE'S JUST ONE PROBLEM.

03:28.239 --> 03:29.840
YOUR CREDIT SUCKS.

03:29.840 --> 03:31.842
YOU CAN STILL GET A LOAN.

03:31.842 --> 03:33.814
YOU JUST NEED SOMEONE
TO CO-SIGN.

03:33.814 --> 03:36.647
OH, NO, NO, NO. NO.
SWEETIE, I LOVE YOU,

03:36.647 --> 03:38.849
BUT I'D BE WATCHING
EVERY DIME YOU SPEND.

03:38.849 --> 03:41.622
I'D BE LIKE YOUR MOM,
AND I SO DON'T WANT THAT.

03:41.622 --> 03:44.455
YOU'RE MY YOUNGER SISTER.
I'M YOUR SLIGHTLY OLDER SISTER.

03:44.455 --> 03:47.328
(Laurie and Andy click tongues)
OH, JUST LET ME HAVE IT,
GUYS.

03:47.328 --> 03:48.629
(laughs)

03:48.629 --> 03:50.000
HEY, TRAV.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.003
YOU KNOW HOW YOU SAID YOU NEEDED
MONEY TO TAKE KYLIE OUT?

03:53.003 --> 03:56.006
WELL, I WILL PAY YOU
TO YANK THIS OFF.

03:56.006 --> 03:59.009
I TRIED THE OTHER ARM,
AND I ALMOST BLACKED OUT.

03:59.009 --> 04:02.273
MNH-MNH.
COME ON.
DROP THE HAMMER FOR MAMA.

04:02.273 --> 04:04.545
MOM, THERE'S GOTTA BE A LINE
SOMEWHERE, DOESN'T THERE?

04:04.545 --> 04:06.547
I MEAN,
YOU'RE WITH ME, RIGHT?

04:06.547 --> 04:08.819
(rip)
OW! WOW.

04:08.819 --> 04:11.952
I ENJOYED THAT.
GREAT. I'LL SEE YOU
EVERY NINE DAYS.

04:11.952 --> 04:13.654
THIS COULDN'T GET WEIRDER.

04:13.654 --> 04:16.256
I'M KEEPING THIS.
STANDING CORRECTED.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.258
(cell phone rings)

04:18.258 --> 04:20.731
OH. HEY, BOBBY.

04:20.731 --> 04:22.262
ROBBED?

04:22.262 --> 04:24.264
ALL RIGHT,
HERE YOU GO, HONEY.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.597
I WANT TO KILL
THE BASTARD WHO HURT YOU!

04:26.597 --> 04:29.400
I-I DON'T CARE IF THEY THROW ME
IN JAIL. I DON'T.

04:29.400 --> 04:32.002
SORRY, BABE. I'M READY TO
THROW MY LIFE AWAY OVER THIS.

04:32.002 --> 04:34.745
I KNOW, BOO BOO.
WHAT IF YOU HAD BEEN KILLED?

04:34.745 --> 04:37.908
I MEAN,
TRAVIS WOULDN'T HAVE A FATHER.

04:37.908 --> 04:40.611
I-I COULD NOT HANDLE THAT.
I MEAN, SURE, I'D GET

04:40.611 --> 04:42.613
A LOT OF SYMPATHY,
AND THAT WOULD BE NICE.

04:42.613 --> 04:45.456
OOH, PROBABLY A LOT OF RANDOM
HUGS FROM TOTAL STRANGERS.

04:45.456 --> 04:48.058
OH, WHY DOES SOMEONE HAVE TO DIE
FOR ME TO GET RANDOM HUGS?

04:48.058 --> 04:49.790
DOESN'T SEEM FAIR.
NO.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.363
WELL, YOU'RE
TAKING THIS PRETTY WELL.

04:52.363 --> 04:55.696
SO ARE YOU, SINCE IT WAS
YOUR MONEY THAT GOT STOLEN.
EXCUSE ME?

04:55.696 --> 04:59.930
YOU SAID CONSIDER THAT MONEY
YOURS, ERGO, YOU GOT ROBBED.
I LOVE HILLBILLY LOGIC.

04:59.930 --> 05:01.502
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS.

05:01.502 --> 05:04.935
SOMEBODY TELL HIM THAT
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS.

05:04.935 --> 05:08.679
SO DID YOU GET A LOOK
AT THE GUY?
YEAH, HE HAD PRETTY LIPS.

05:08.679 --> 05:11.742
WH--
I KINDA GOT MUGGED BY A CHICK.

05:11.742 --> 05:13.844
DID SHE HAVE A KNIFE?
NO.

05:13.844 --> 05:16.647
A GUN? A BAT? ANYTHING SCARY?
NO. NO. NO. NOPE.

05:16.647 --> 05:19.590
YOU LET AN UNARMED GIRL
TAKE MY MONEY?

05:19.590 --> 05:21.922
OH! Y'ALL HEARD THAT, RIGHT?
HE SAID HIS MONEY.

05:21.922 --> 05:24.925
YEAH, CRYSTAL CLEAR.
OH, WE HEARD IT.
LEGALLY BINDING.

05:24.925 --> 05:27.858
NOW YOU CHIME IN?
WELL, NOW IT'S FUN.

05:27.858 --> 05:30.060
JUST TO LET YOU KNOW,

05:30.060 --> 05:33.063
FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS,
I PLAN ON BEING INDISPOSED.

05:33.063 --> 05:35.065
I'M GOING TO MY--
ALL RIGHT, FREEZE.

05:35.065 --> 05:37.067
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
YOUR SEX STORIES.

05:37.067 --> 05:39.970
BECAUSE OF YOU, I STILL
CAN'T USE YOGA MATS AT THE GYM

05:39.970 --> 05:41.972
OR EAT
CHOCOLATE-COVERED ANYTHING.

05:41.972 --> 05:44.014
I'M JUST GOING BACK
TO MY DERMO.

05:44.014 --> 05:48.479
THAT'S RIGHT, CHER.
BARB'S GONNA TURN BACK TIME.

05:51.952 --> 05:54.385
HELLO? MAY I HELP YOU?

05:54.385 --> 05:58.429
NO ONE WAS HERE SO I THOUGHT
I'D JUST DO A LITTLE SNOOPING.
I'M GONNA NEED
MORE THAN THAT.

05:58.429 --> 06:02.593
NOW WHY DO YOU HAVE A POST-IT
HERE THAT SAYS "I'M AWESOME"?
BECAUSE I AM.

06:02.593 --> 06:04.895
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,

06:04.895 --> 06:07.898
YOU NEED TO GET YOUR CRAZY ASS
OUT OF HERE RIGHT NOW,

06:07.898 --> 06:09.900
OR I'M GONNA CALL
PLAZA SECURITY,

06:09.900 --> 06:12.573
AND THEY'RE GONNA
ROLLERBLADE RIGHT OVER HERE

06:12.573 --> 06:14.575
IN, LIKE, 40 MINUTES.
AND IF YOU TRY ANYTHING,

06:14.575 --> 06:17.047
I'M GONNA STAB YOU IN THE NECK
WITH THIS CLICKY PEN.
(pen clicks)

06:17.047 --> 06:18.449
HI, MOM.

06:18.449 --> 06:20.611
MOM?

06:22.382 --> 06:24.585
WHEW. YOU'RE LUCKY.
(pen clicks)

06:24.585 --> 06:30.591
в™Єв™Є

06:36.697 --> 06:38.699
SO, MOM,
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU

06:38.699 --> 06:40.701
SINCE YOU RAN OFF
WITH THAT DOCTOR.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.803
I HEARD HE GOT BUSTED
FOR FEELING UP OLD LADIES.

06:42.803 --> 06:44.475
HE GOT OFF.

06:44.475 --> 06:47.007
IT WAS A CLASSIC CASE
OF "HE SAID/THEY ALL SAID."

06:47.007 --> 06:50.010
LET ME SAY THAT YOUR DAUGHTER
LAURIE IS--IS JUST AMAZING.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.682
SHE REALLY IS.

06:51.682 --> 06:54.885
SHE'S MY FRIEND AND--WELL, HELL,
YOU'RE MORE THAN MY FRIEND.

06:54.885 --> 06:57.588
SHUT UP!

06:57.588 --> 07:00.050
ARE YOU TWO LESBIANS?
WHICH ONE'S THE DUDE?

07:00.050 --> 07:02.052
(laughs)
WE'RE NOT LESBIANS, MOM!

07:02.052 --> 07:04.825
I MEAN, SHE'D BE THE DUDE.
WHAT?

07:04.825 --> 07:06.497
OH, COME ON.

07:06.497 --> 07:08.529
I COULD TOTALLY SEE US DATING.
WE'D BE LIKE ELLEN AND PORTIA.

07:08.529 --> 07:10.100
I CALL PORTIA.
I CALL PORTIA.

07:10.100 --> 07:13.504
SO DID YOU TALK TO YOUR MOM
ABOUT CO-SIGNING FOR THE CONDO?

07:13.504 --> 07:15.165
NOT YET,

07:15.165 --> 07:17.167
BUT, HEY,
THANKS FOR JUMPING IN.

07:17.167 --> 07:19.710
WOW. I'M SORRY.
I-I'M--I'M GONNA LEAVE YOU TWO.

07:19.710 --> 07:21.642
(chuckles) OKAY.

07:21.642 --> 07:25.476
OH, MY GOD. LAURIE, YOUR BUTT
LOOKS AMAZING IN THOSE JEANS.

07:25.476 --> 07:27.017
(mouths word)
BYE, ELLEN.

07:27.017 --> 07:30.180
I'M GONNA BE PORTIA.

07:32.483 --> 07:35.155
ARE YOU STILL GROUCHY
ABOUT MY ALLEGED TAB?

07:35.155 --> 07:37.087
OH! HEAD FAKE!

07:37.087 --> 07:39.860
(high-pitched voice)
GOOD-BYE, DELICIOUS BEER!

07:39.860 --> 07:42.533
OH!
(makes slurping sounds)

07:42.533 --> 07:44.134
MMM! HMM!

07:44.134 --> 07:45.465
THAT'S HATEFUL.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.467
I FELT BAD
ABOUT YOU GETTING MUGGED,

07:47.467 --> 07:50.140
SO I BOUGHT YOU SOME STUFF.

07:50.140 --> 07:52.002
A RAPE WHISTLE

07:52.002 --> 07:54.505
TO HELP YOU WARD OFF
OTHER SCARY LADY MUGGERS...

07:54.505 --> 07:57.508
SOME OF THAT YOGURT
THAT MAKES OLD GALS POOP...

07:57.508 --> 08:00.611
THAT STUFF REALLY WORKS.
LIKE, BOOM! (chuckles)

08:00.611 --> 08:02.082
AND SOME TAMPONS.

08:02.082 --> 08:03.914
OOH! AWESOME!

08:03.914 --> 08:05.956
HEY, IF I PUT THESE IN
THE MACHINE IN THE LADIES' ROOM,

08:05.956 --> 08:08.258
CAN I GET SOME NACHOS?
(scoffs)

08:08.258 --> 08:11.522
HOW ARE YOU NOT EMBARRASSED?
SORRY, ELLIE. CAN'T BE DONE.

08:11.522 --> 08:14.525
IT'S TRUE. THIS IS A GUY
WHOSE MAIN GOAL IN LIFE

08:14.525 --> 08:17.798
IS TO PARTY SO HARD HE CRAPS
HIS PANTS IN EVERY COUNTRY.

08:17.798 --> 08:20.070
I ALREADY KNOCKED OFF
AMERICA AND MEXICO.

08:20.070 --> 08:21.802
(chuckles) MEXICO WAS EASY.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.273
(mutters) THAT'S NICE.

08:23.273 --> 08:25.205
(doorbell rings)

08:25.205 --> 08:27.007
HELLO?

08:27.007 --> 08:28.709
BARB?

08:28.709 --> 08:34.114
I RESPONDED TO YOUR AD
FOR AN ERRAND BOY?

08:34.114 --> 08:36.617
(Barb) THERE'S MONEY
AND A LIST ON THE TABLE.

08:36.617 --> 08:39.249
WHEN YOU RETURN,
KNOCK LIKE THIS...

08:43.624 --> 08:46.727
THEN WAIT 80 SECONDS
FOR ME TO RETURN TO THE SHADOWS.

08:46.727 --> 08:49.099
ARE YOU GONNA MURDER ME?

08:49.099 --> 08:50.731
I'VE DONE THINGS TO MYSELF,

08:50.731 --> 08:53.804
THINGS YOUR SWEET YOUNG EYES
SHOULDN'T SEE.

08:53.804 --> 08:57.107
THIS IS WEIRD.

08:57.107 --> 09:02.272
BUT MY MOM CAN'T CO-SIGN.
HER JOB'S NOT GOING GREAT.

09:02.272 --> 09:05.876
WHAT DOES SHE DO?
SHE PRETENDS THAT PEOPLE
BACK THEIR CARS INTO HER.

09:05.876 --> 09:07.317
WHATEVER.

09:07.317 --> 09:10.320
IT'S JUST NOT THE RIGHT TIME
FOR ME TO BUY A CONDO.

09:10.320 --> 09:12.322
MY MOM'S IN CRAZY DEBT,

09:12.322 --> 09:15.726
SO I THINK I'M JUST GONNA
HELP HER GET BACK ON HER FEET.
LAURIE, NO!

09:15.726 --> 09:20.190
THAT'S YOUR MONEY.
YOU TELL YOUR MOM--
OKAY, COULD WE JUST MAYBE NOT
HAVE THIS CONVERSATION

09:20.190 --> 09:22.763
IN FRONT OF EVERYONE?
ALL RIGHT, DON'T FEEL WEIRD.

09:22.763 --> 09:24.665
WE ALL HAVE OUR EMBARRASSING
FAMILY MEMBERS.

09:24.665 --> 09:26.166
HELLO!

09:26.166 --> 09:27.938
THAT WASN'T A COINCIDENCE.

09:27.938 --> 09:30.170
I WAS OUT BACK
WAITIN' FOR AN ENTRANCE LINE.

09:30.170 --> 09:33.944
MY DAD DRANK HIMSELF TO DEATH.
THAT'S NOT EMBARRASSING.
THAT'S HORRIBLE.

09:33.944 --> 09:37.107
HE PEED HIS PANTS A LOT.
THAT'S A LITTLE FUNNY.

09:37.107 --> 09:39.980
(laughs) MY BROTHER
WAS A CHEERLEADER,

09:39.980 --> 09:43.153
AND HE WEARS KIMONOS
ALL THE TIME.
SO YOU HAVE A GAY BROTHER.
BIG DEAL.

09:43.153 --> 09:45.986
RICK'S NOT GAY! HE'S GOT
A TAFFY SHOP UP IN VERMONT

09:45.986 --> 09:47.658
WITH HIS ROOMMATE STEVE.

09:47.658 --> 09:50.160
(gasps) OH. HE IS GAY.
YOU THINK?

09:50.160 --> 09:51.692
OH. THAT'S COOL.

09:51.692 --> 09:54.094
THE POINT IS, WE ALL HAVE
THAT RELATIVE,

09:54.094 --> 09:56.196
BUT YOU CANNOT GET SUCKED UP
IN THEIR CRAZINESS.

09:56.196 --> 09:59.199
THEY WILL TAKE YOU DOWN
WITH THEM.
JULES, IT'S MY MOM.

09:59.199 --> 10:02.703
HONEY, JUST PLEASE TRY
TO STAY OUT OF THIS, OKAY?

10:02.703 --> 10:04.034
YEAH, BUT--

10:04.034 --> 10:06.376
NO "YEAH BUTs."
JUST PROMISE.

10:06.376 --> 10:07.638
YEAH, BUT...

10:09.079 --> 10:11.642
MM. ALL RIGHT, FINE.
I-I PROMISE.

10:11.642 --> 10:13.083
THANK YOU.

10:15.015 --> 10:16.316
(coin clinks)
OHH!

10:16.316 --> 10:18.388
(coin clinks)

10:18.388 --> 10:20.691
(both, high-pitched voice)
в™Є PENNY CAN! в™Є

10:20.691 --> 10:22.693
(normal voice) OH, GRAYSON,
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE

10:22.693 --> 10:25.025
THE NEW PENNY CAN RULE
BOBBY MADE.

10:25.025 --> 10:28.028
YOU HAVE TO SING
WHEN SOMEONE MAKES IT.
I DON'T CARE. YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:28.028 --> 10:31.031
WE'RE GONNA PAY OFF YOUR BAR TAB
TODAY ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

10:31.031 --> 10:33.363
YOU GOTTA HAVE SOMETHING ON HERE
THAT'S WORTH SOMETHING.

10:33.363 --> 10:35.365
DOES THIS WORK?
WORKS AS A CONTAINER
FOR OLD ENVELOPES.

10:35.365 --> 10:38.108
AND IF YOU'RE PUTTIN' ON A PLAY,
IT MAKES A GOOD PROP TOASTER.
(coin clinks)

10:38.108 --> 10:40.140
(all, high-pitched voice)
в™Є PENNY CAN! в™Є

10:40.140 --> 10:42.673
(normal voice) YOU'RE RIGHT.
I LOVE IT.

10:42.673 --> 10:45.045
YOU KNOW, BOBBY,
THE, UH, MUGGER--

10:45.045 --> 10:48.178
SHE'S GOT YOUR WALLET
SO SHE KNOWS WHERE YA LIVE.

10:48.178 --> 10:50.180
DON'T YOU WORRY.
I GOT PROTECTION.

10:50.180 --> 10:52.923
TO SCARE OFF INTRUDERS,
I BOUGHT A BARKING DOG CD.

10:52.923 --> 10:54.654
(coin clanks)

10:54.654 --> 10:56.326
OOH, RIM SHOT.

10:56.326 --> 10:58.188
AAH! OW!

10:58.188 --> 11:00.360
NEW RIM SHOT RULE.
I LIKE IT.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.892
OOH!
AHH!

11:01.892 --> 11:03.063
LET'S GO.

11:05.095 --> 11:07.137
OH.

11:07.137 --> 11:08.839
HI, SHEILA.

11:08.839 --> 11:10.901
IT'S NICE TO, UM...
HELLO.

11:10.901 --> 11:13.944
I'M HAVING A "ME" DAY--
NEW CLOTHES, NEW MAKEUP.

11:13.944 --> 11:17.207
LOOKIE, PERMANENT EYELINER.
YOU CAN TOUCH IT.
NO, NO. I TRUST YOU.

11:17.207 --> 11:20.380
NO, NO,
IT'S NOT GOIN' ANYWHERE.
OKAY, P-PLEASE LET ME STOP.

11:20.380 --> 11:23.153
SO YOU'RE LAURIE'S MOM.
I'M ELLIE.

11:23.153 --> 11:26.416
ARE YOU A FRIEND OF LAURIE'S,
TOO?
I'M ELLIE.

11:26.416 --> 11:28.889
YOU HAVE NICE HAIR.
SEE YA.

11:28.889 --> 11:31.061
WELL, SHE'S NOT THAT BAD.

11:31.061 --> 11:33.794
OH, COME ON. SHE IS OUT
SPENDING LAURIE'S MONEY.

11:33.794 --> 11:36.997
I THINK LAURIE WOULD WANT ME
TO SAY SOMETHING.

11:36.997 --> 11:41.101
WELL, I'M GONNA DO IT.
PUT THE BROWS DOWN.

11:41.101 --> 11:43.433
(rhythmic knocks on door)

11:43.433 --> 11:45.075
ENTRE.

11:46.977 --> 11:49.479
(pills rattling)
GOT YOUR PAINKILLERS.

11:49.479 --> 11:52.112
MY WILL IS FADING.

11:52.112 --> 11:54.444
I'M SURE IT'S NOT BAD.
LET ME SEE.

11:54.444 --> 11:55.816
NO!

11:55.816 --> 11:58.819
INNOCENCE SHOULD BE LOST
IN THE BEDROOM.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.891
OR ON A COMMERCIAL
CRUISE LINER.

12:00.891 --> 12:03.223
I CAN HANDLE IT. PROMISE.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.455
BE KIND.

12:07.958 --> 12:09.129
UHH!
(thud)

12:11.101 --> 12:13.303
(loud bang)

12:13.303 --> 12:16.166
HELLO? SOMEONE OUT THERE?

12:16.166 --> 12:20.040
SEE, I GOT A VICIOUS DOG.
DON'T I, BOY?

12:20.040 --> 12:23.814
(dog barking to tune of
"Jingle Bells")

12:23.814 --> 12:25.115
(whispers) DAMN.

12:38.028 --> 12:39.790
(grunts)

12:47.237 --> 12:48.138
AAH!

12:49.769 --> 12:52.402
(laughs) AAH!

12:52.402 --> 12:55.305
GIVE ME ALL YOUR MONEY!
WHAT THE HECK?

12:55.305 --> 12:58.208
(Grayson, Andy and Ellie
laugh and scream)
AAH! OHH!

12:58.208 --> 13:01.381
I DON'T LIKE WHEN PEOPLE
SCARE ME! IT MAKES ME FEEL DUMB.
(dog continues barking)

13:01.381 --> 13:03.253
DUMB LIKE EMBARRASSED?

13:03.253 --> 13:05.085
I THINK YOU COULDN'T
BE EMBARRASSED.

13:05.085 --> 13:07.187
(grunts)

13:07.187 --> 13:10.060
WHY ARE THERE DOGS
SINGING CHRISTMAS CAROLS?

13:12.562 --> 13:15.325
THAT'S A FANCY OVEN.

13:15.325 --> 13:18.168
HOW'D YOU GET SOMEONE
TO BUY IT FOR YOU?

13:18.168 --> 13:20.800
YOU MUST HAVE A SUGAR COOCHIE.

13:20.800 --> 13:24.234
I MIGHT HAVE A SUGAR COOCHIE,
BUT I PAID FOR THAT OVEN.

13:24.234 --> 13:26.576
WHY'D YOU ASK ME OVER HERE?

13:26.576 --> 13:29.279
LOOK, LAURIE IS IN A PLACE
IN HER LIFE RIGHT NOW

13:29.279 --> 13:31.581
WHERE SHE CAN STAND ON
HER OWN TWO FEET.

13:31.581 --> 13:35.115
I KNOW AS A MOM YOU--YOU DON'T
WANT TO GET IN THE WAY OF THAT.

13:35.115 --> 13:37.117
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO JUDGE ME.
I RAISED HER.

13:37.117 --> 13:38.588
I PAID FOR PERMS,

13:38.588 --> 13:40.250
CANDY CIGARETTES,
REAL CIGARETTES.

13:40.250 --> 13:42.953
SHE OWES ME.
NOW I'M GETTIN' MINE.

13:42.953 --> 13:45.555
YOU KNOW, I DON'T NORMALLY SAY
MEAN THINGS. I THINK THEM.

13:45.555 --> 13:47.557
I WRITE THEM
ON SCRAP PIECES OF PAPER

13:47.557 --> 13:49.559
AND PUT THEM IN MY PURSE.

13:49.559 --> 13:51.561
I READ THEM
AT NIGHT TO THE MIRROR

13:51.561 --> 13:53.563
AND PRETEND I ACTUALLY AM
SAYING THEM.

13:53.563 --> 13:55.605
BUT WITH YOU,
I'M MAKING AN EXCEPTION.

13:55.605 --> 13:58.568
NOW THERE IS ONLY ONE GOOD MOM
STANDING IN THIS ROOM,

13:58.568 --> 14:00.871
AND HER MIDDLE NAME
IS, UNFORTUNATELY, KIKI.

14:00.871 --> 14:03.243
IT'S A LONG, SAD STORY.

14:03.243 --> 14:07.177
UH, THE--THE POINT IS,
YOU'RE A HORRIBLE MOM.
JULES!

14:07.177 --> 14:09.179
YOU PROMISED.

14:09.179 --> 14:10.380
YEAH, BUT...

14:11.882 --> 14:14.054
OH, CRAP.

14:22.132 --> 14:24.134
IT'S NOT MY FAULT, LAURIE.

14:24.134 --> 14:27.237
I-I WAS BEING NICE, BUT THEN
SHE STEPPED TO ME IN MY KITCHEN.

14:27.237 --> 14:29.940
NICE TRY... KIKI.
(whispers) DON'T YOU DARE.

14:29.940 --> 14:31.501
I LOVE LAURIE,

14:31.501 --> 14:36.206
EVEN IF HER BEING BORN
WAS THE REASON HER DADDY LEFT.
WHO SAYS THAT?

14:36.206 --> 14:38.208
IT'S TRUE.
DADDY GOT HIS, THOUGH.

14:38.208 --> 14:40.210
NEVER GOT REELECTED
STATE TREASURER AGAIN.

14:40.210 --> 14:42.052
WHO'S LAUGHIN' NOW,
REAL WIFE AND KIDS?

14:42.052 --> 14:44.284
SEE, LAURIE'S ALREADY
GOT ME,

14:44.284 --> 14:47.187
SO STOP TRYING TO BE HER MOM.
WE'VE ALREADY BEEN OVER THIS.

14:47.187 --> 14:50.260
I'M MORE LIKE
HER SLIGHTLY OLDER SISTER.
(clicks tongue)

14:50.260 --> 14:54.164
OH, WHAT THE HELL?
IS THIS A FAMILY GESTURE?
I'M OUTTA HERE.

14:54.164 --> 14:58.628
LAURIE, ARE YOU COMING?

14:58.628 --> 15:01.231
I'M SORRY, JULES.

15:01.231 --> 15:04.304
COME ON, MAMA.

15:04.304 --> 15:06.506
UH, SO I GOTTA
GET MY NIECE HOME

15:06.506 --> 15:09.079
BECAUSE I NEVER CLEARED IT
WITH HER PARENTS.

15:09.079 --> 15:11.311
YOU ALL RIGHT, PRINCESS?
HEY, HIT THE BRICKS.

15:11.311 --> 15:13.243
HA HA!

15:13.243 --> 15:16.186
I GET WHY SHE'S PICKING ON ME.
BUT YOU?

15:16.186 --> 15:19.149
MY GUYS?
MY MURDOCH AND FACE?

15:19.149 --> 15:22.122
UNTIL YOU PAY YOUR TAB,
I HAVE NO LOYALTY TO YOU.

15:22.122 --> 15:23.193
HUH.

15:23.193 --> 15:24.654
WHAT ABOUT YOU, FACE?

15:24.654 --> 15:27.257
HOW'S HE FACE? HE ISN'T...

15:27.257 --> 15:29.259
ELLIE THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR ME

15:29.259 --> 15:31.301
TO SEE YOU KNOCKED OFF
YOUR PEDESTAL.

15:31.301 --> 15:33.263
ANDY.
I FORGIVE YOU, BROTHER.

15:35.335 --> 15:37.367
HOW'S HE FACE?

15:39.239 --> 15:41.171
YOU CAN OPEN YOUR EYES.

15:41.171 --> 15:44.444
I DON'T THINK I CAN.
STOP BEING SUCH A BABY.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.416
A CHEMICAL PEEL
IS NOTHING MORE THAN

15:46.416 --> 15:50.180
A SECOND-DEGREE BURN
INDUCED BY CONCENTRATED ACID.

15:50.180 --> 15:52.652
YOU LOOK LIKE A GRAPE.

15:52.652 --> 15:56.156
DOES IT HURT?
LIKE A THOUSAND
SONS OF BITCHES.

15:56.156 --> 15:57.657
BARB...

15:57.657 --> 15:59.329
I'M SO SORRY.

15:59.329 --> 16:01.291
(whispers) THANKS, KIDDO.

16:01.291 --> 16:03.563
HEY.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.195
HEY.

16:05.195 --> 16:08.238
I KNOW YOU PROBABLY DON'T
WANT TO EVER SEE ME AGAIN

16:08.238 --> 16:10.740
AFTER YESTERDAY,
BUT I-I WANTED TO COME IN, SO...

16:10.740 --> 16:13.003
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

16:13.003 --> 16:15.005
HEY, I GOT US
SOME DOUGHNUTS.

16:16.676 --> 16:18.208
WHAT'S WRONG?

16:18.208 --> 16:20.650
(voice breaks) I CAN'T
BELIEVE YOU DON'T HATE ME.

16:20.650 --> 16:22.412
HATE YOU?

16:22.412 --> 16:25.315
OH, MY GOD,
THAT IS SO SAD.

16:25.315 --> 16:27.987
OH, NOW YOU'RE GONNA
MAKE ME CRY, TOO.

16:32.362 --> 16:35.365
OH, CRAP. I THINK
I JUST WANT IT TOO MUCH.

16:35.365 --> 16:37.197
(laughs)

16:37.197 --> 16:38.728
LOOK, THAT'S YOUR MOM.

16:38.728 --> 16:41.301
YEAH.
I'M ON YOUR SIDE.
I LOVE YOU.

16:41.301 --> 16:46.005
YOU ARE SO SUPPORTIVE
AND AMAZING.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.407
AND... WAIT.

16:47.407 --> 16:49.509
THAT WAS YOUR WHOLE STRATEGY,
WASN'T IT?

16:49.509 --> 16:51.481
TO BE SO SUPER NICE

16:51.481 --> 16:54.484
THAT I-I WOULD JUST HANDLE THIS
THE WAY THAT YOU WANTED ME TO,

16:54.484 --> 16:57.187
TO MAKE YOU HAPPY.
(chuckles)
PRETTY GENIUS, ISN'T IT?

16:57.187 --> 16:58.588
(laughs)

16:58.588 --> 17:00.720
I MADE YOU DANCE.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.093
(making clicking sounds)
(speaking indistinctly)

17:03.093 --> 17:07.327
(laughs)
I DON'T GET IT. YOU DON'T
LET ANYONE WALK OVER YOU.

17:07.327 --> 17:08.628
JULES...

17:08.628 --> 17:11.101
MY MOM IS SCARY.

17:11.101 --> 17:13.103
MY WHOLE LIFE,
SHE CONVINCED ME

17:13.103 --> 17:15.205
THAT I WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH
TO DO...

17:15.205 --> 17:17.267
WELL, ANYTHING.

17:17.267 --> 17:20.340
PLUS, SHE FIGHTS DIRTY.
I MEAN, SHE KNOWS

17:20.340 --> 17:23.713
THE EXACT PLACE TO PUNCH
A PERSON TO MAKE THEM THROW UP.

17:23.713 --> 17:26.045
IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY BADASS.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.348
NO MATTER WHAT, I'M WITH YOU.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.350
OKAY, NOW COME HERE.

17:30.350 --> 17:32.422
OH! (chuckles)
(chuckles)

17:32.422 --> 17:35.285
(gasps)

17:35.285 --> 17:36.456
TEARS.

17:36.456 --> 17:38.358
I'VE GOT IT!

17:39.629 --> 17:41.691
OH!

17:44.194 --> 17:46.696
WHY ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME?
WELL, I DON'T WORK,

17:46.696 --> 17:49.199
SO I THOUGHT I'D SPEND THE DAY
DRINKING IN YOUR EMBARRASSMENT.

17:49.199 --> 17:53.143
IT'S SO DELICIOUS.
HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY!
DON'T DO THAT.

17:53.143 --> 17:56.776
A WOMAN IN THERE THINKS SHE CAN
TELL MY DAUGHTER HOW TO ACT.

17:56.776 --> 17:59.609
LADY, JUST--JUST CHILL OUT,
ALL RIGHT?
(exhales deeply)

17:59.609 --> 18:01.211
PUKE PUNCH.

18:01.211 --> 18:02.382
OHH! (gags)

18:02.382 --> 18:05.515
WHOA!
GOD, IT'S GONNA COME UP!

18:05.515 --> 18:07.517
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?!

18:07.517 --> 18:10.320
OH, DON'T BOTHER ME.
OH!

18:11.521 --> 18:12.862
DON'T--OH!

18:12.862 --> 18:14.564
YOU--ARE YOU CRAZY?!

18:14.564 --> 18:16.866
(sighs) THERE HAVE BEEN
SO MANY TIMES IN MY LIFE

18:16.866 --> 18:19.229
THAT I'VE WANTED
TO STAND UP TO HER.

18:19.229 --> 18:23.333
GOSH, DO YOU THINK SHE AT ALL
WANTS TO BE A BETTER PERSON?
(Ellie grunting)

18:29.239 --> 18:31.741
(gasps) HOLY CRAP!

18:31.741 --> 18:34.244
ALL RIGHT, COME ON, BITCH!
I'M BEGGING YA!

18:34.244 --> 18:36.416
W-WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU,
A LATIN KING?!

18:36.416 --> 18:38.588
MOM, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?!

18:38.588 --> 18:41.221
I SAW YOU HUGGING
THAT WOMAN.

18:41.221 --> 18:43.593
"THAT WOMAN"
HAPPENS TO BE MY FAMILY.

18:43.593 --> 18:46.526
AND SO ARE THEY.
WELL, YOU KNOW, HE IS, ANYWAY.

18:46.526 --> 18:49.399
(groans)
OH, DOES IT EVER STOP?

18:49.399 --> 18:50.600
(vomits)

18:50.600 --> 18:54.534
GOD, I LOVE YOU,
BUT I'M SO SICK OF YOUR CRAP.

18:54.534 --> 18:57.537
LOOK, WHEN YOU'RE READY
TO BE WITH ME FOR ME

18:57.537 --> 19:00.240
AND NOT BECAUSE YOU NEED
SOMETHING LIKE...

19:00.240 --> 19:03.613
(scoffs) MONEY OR URINE
FOR YOUR PAROLE OFFICER,

19:03.613 --> 19:06.216
I WILL BE RIGHT HERE.

19:06.216 --> 19:09.349
YOU WIN.
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY.

19:09.349 --> 19:12.282
(laughs) OH, YEAH, BECAUSE
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT.

19:12.282 --> 19:13.483
(sighs)

19:13.483 --> 19:15.925
в™Єв™Є

19:15.925 --> 19:17.927
GO AHEAD, JULES.
YES!

19:17.927 --> 19:20.790
(laughs)

19:20.790 --> 19:23.162
MAN, ANDY, YOU SHOULD'VE
SEEN YOUR WIFE.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.794
SHE'S A FIGHTER.
(chuckles)

19:24.794 --> 19:28.198
YEAH. SHE ALWAYS WINS
WHEN WE SEX WRESTLE.

19:28.198 --> 19:31.271
REALLY?
OH, COME ON.
I CAN SHARE THAT.

19:31.271 --> 19:33.443
IT'S NOT LIKE WE WEAR MASKS
OR ANYTHING.

19:33.443 --> 19:34.944
WELL, I DON'T.

19:34.944 --> 19:36.776
в™Єв™Є

19:36.776 --> 19:38.778
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT
I JUST REALIZED, ELLIE?

19:38.778 --> 19:41.781
YOU TOOK THE TIME
TO PULL A PRANK ON ME

19:41.781 --> 19:43.783
AND YOU HAD MY BACK
IN A FIGHT.

19:43.783 --> 19:46.316
THAT'S FRIENDS STUFF.
WE'RE FRIENDS AGAIN, AREN'T WE?
(gasps)

19:46.316 --> 19:48.618
ANDY, OUT.

19:48.618 --> 19:49.759
в™Єв™Є

19:49.759 --> 19:51.761
I DON'T WANT HIM
WETTING THE FLOOR.

19:51.761 --> 19:54.324
SAY WE'RE FRIENDS.

19:54.324 --> 19:56.326
LOOK, SINCE YOU AND JULES
GOT DIVORCED,

19:56.326 --> 19:58.328
I HAVE NOTICED SOME CHANGES.

19:58.328 --> 20:00.330
I THINK YOU'RE A GOOD FATHER.

20:00.330 --> 20:02.672
I THINK YOU'RE TRYING TO BE
A LESS RIDICULOUS PERSON.

20:02.672 --> 20:04.474
SO FINE,

20:04.474 --> 20:08.308
MAYBE WE'RE CLOSER
TO BEING...

20:08.308 --> 20:09.609
I'M YOU'RE FRIEND.

20:09.609 --> 20:11.611
YES, YOU'RE MY FRIEND.

20:11.611 --> 20:13.583
YES! AH, HA HA!

20:13.583 --> 20:16.346
OH, HO! I AM ALIVE AGAIN!

20:16.346 --> 20:18.948
OH, I SEE STARS! OH!

20:18.948 --> 20:20.290
DON'T PEEK.

20:20.290 --> 20:22.392
DON'T PEEK.

20:22.392 --> 20:23.853
DON'T PEEK.
(laughs)

20:23.853 --> 20:26.296
ALL RIGHT. SURPRISE!

20:26.296 --> 20:28.428
HONEY, IF YOU WANT ME
TO WORK OVER THE WEEKEND,

20:28.428 --> 20:30.430
YOU JUST HAVE TO ASK.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.632
NO, THESE ARE THE CLOSING PAPERS
ON YOUR CONDO.

20:32.632 --> 20:34.464
I CO-SIGNED YOUR LOAN.

20:34.464 --> 20:35.865
JULES!

20:35.865 --> 20:38.237
NO, IT'S TOO MUCH.

20:38.237 --> 20:41.311
NO, NO, HONEY, I WANTED TO.
THANK YOU.

20:41.311 --> 20:43.313
(laughs)
(Andy) IT'S OVER!

20:43.313 --> 20:46.316
(Jules and Laurie) AAH!
IT'S OVER!
OH, THE FEUD HAS ENDED!

20:46.316 --> 20:47.617
OH, HO HO!

20:47.617 --> 20:50.350
THEY'RE FRIENDS AGAIN!
HA HA HA!

20:50.350 --> 20:52.352
IT'S OVER! YES!

20:57.957 --> 20:59.629
I'M SORRY, BARB.

20:59.629 --> 21:01.731
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SPANX ARE,

21:01.731 --> 21:04.734
BUT I KNOW I DON'T WANT
TO HELP YOU PUT YOURS OWN.

21:04.734 --> 21:07.397
OH.
OKAY, BYE.

21:07.397 --> 21:10.269
(sighs) YOU KNOW WHY
I FEEL SORRY FOR HER?

21:10.269 --> 21:11.941
BECAUSE SHE'S ALL ALONE.

21:11.941 --> 21:13.943
I MEAN, SHE'S GOT KIDS
OF HER OWN,

21:13.943 --> 21:15.945
BUT SHE WON'T
ASK THEM FOR HELP

21:15.945 --> 21:17.977
BECAUSE SHE'S NOT COMFORTABLE
FEELING VULNERABLE AROUND THEM.

21:17.977 --> 21:20.680
LET'S NEVER LET THAT
BE US, OKAY?

21:20.680 --> 21:23.383
IT'S TIME AGAIN.
OH, PLEASE, GOD, NO.

21:23.383 --> 21:24.854
GRAYSON'S NOT HOME.

21:24.854 --> 21:27.357
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO
PULL THEM OFF.

21:27.357 --> 21:30.360
JUST HOLD ON TO THE TAPE,
AND I'LL RUN AWAY.
(sighs deeply)

21:30.360 --> 21:31.461
ONE...

21:31.461 --> 21:32.492
TWO...

21:32.492 --> 21:34.394
(loud rip)
OW!

21:34.394 --> 21:36.396
UGH! UGH! (cries and whines)
