11:55.169 --> 11:57.090
Now I can get back to my potion.

11:58.190 --> 12:02.000
(Bigmouth)
'Bigmouth hungry!'

12:02.019 --> 12:03.230
[Jokey giggles]

12:04.009 --> 12:07.009
Present for Bigmouth?

12:07.029 --> 12:09.039
It's a surprise.

12:09.059 --> 12:10.220
[Jokey giggles]

12:14.230 --> 12:16.039
Mmm.

12:16.059 --> 12:17.120
[explosion]

12:17.139 --> 12:20.179
Good. But too spicy.

12:22.009 --> 12:24.090
A few more ingredients
and it's ready.

12:26.210 --> 12:29.200
(Bigmouth)
'Bigmouth hungry!'

12:29.220 --> 12:31.220
[Bigmouth stomping]

12:32.000 --> 12:36.049
If I have to search a thousand
years, I will find that village.

12:36.070 --> 12:37.220
Do you hear, Azrael?

12:38.000 --> 12:39.090
[mewing]

12:39.110 --> 12:42.059
[instrumental music]

12:48.059 --> 12:50.059
(Greedy)
It's ready, Mr. Bigmouth.

12:51.190 --> 12:53.139
[sniffing]

12:53.159 --> 12:57.009
Mmm! Goodies smell good.

12:57.029 --> 12:58.169
[Bigmouth slurping]

13:06.019 --> 13:08.159
I prepared my special
mushroom-puff pie

13:08.179 --> 13:12.090
cold asparagus tips, smurfed
truffles cooked in honey.

13:12.110 --> 13:14.110
(Bigmouth)
Mm, good.

13:14.129 --> 13:16.200
[Bigmouth slurping]

13:16.220 --> 13:18.230
Fresh smurfberries
smothered in a..

13:19.009 --> 13:21.009
Ow! Ooh! Ouch!

13:21.029 --> 13:23.100
[hiccups]
Still hungry.

13:23.120 --> 13:25.070
Where smurf soup?

13:25.090 --> 13:30.029
Soup? I could have eaten all
that stuff. Now you want soup.

13:30.049 --> 13:34.090
(Bigmouth)
Ow! No kick Bigmouth in corn.

13:34.110 --> 13:35.129
I want soup!

13:37.080 --> 13:39.059
C-coming right up, Mr. Bigmouth.

13:41.230 --> 13:47.019
We're getting closer to the
village, Azrael. I can feel it.

13:48.129 --> 13:49.210
[mews]

13:53.159 --> 13:57.039
Now, smurf a bit of bee honey
with a...

13:57.059 --> 13:59.080
(Bigmouth)
'Me hungry!'

13:59.100 --> 14:04.029
I'll never finish
with all these interruptions.

14:04.049 --> 14:06.120
I want soup.

14:06.139 --> 14:08.169
Now, listen, Bigmouth.
You'll have to..

14:08.190 --> 14:10.100
thud

14:11.200 --> 14:14.139
Oh, Papa Smurf.
Are you alright?

14:14.159 --> 14:18.009
[groans]
All except one cheek.

14:18.029 --> 14:21.149
Ooh. Want me to smurf him
a good one, Papa Smurf?

14:21.169 --> 14:23.200
What are we going to do,
Papa Smurf?

14:23.220 --> 14:26.100
There's only one thing to do.

14:26.120 --> 14:28.100
Make the soup a la smurf.

14:28.120 --> 14:29.179
- Huh?
- Huh?

14:31.159 --> 14:36.169
I-I-I must have taken
a wrong turn somewhere, Azrael.

14:36.190 --> 14:38.070
[mews]

14:39.049 --> 14:40.159
Now here's the plan.

14:40.179 --> 14:44.009
When the water starts to boil,
you'll all jump in and--

14:44.029 --> 14:46.039
- What?
- No way, Jose.

14:46.059 --> 14:47.190
[clamoring]

14:50.019 --> 14:52.000
Come back here!

14:52.220 --> 14:54.230
You have nothing to worry about.

14:55.009 --> 14:57.059
This potion will protect you
from the heat.

14:58.220 --> 15:01.009
(Bigmouth)
'I want soup!'

15:01.029 --> 15:02.179
That's enough. Come on.

15:02.200 --> 15:04.190
Where Bigmouth's soup?

15:04.210 --> 15:06.200
Coming right up, Mr. Bigmouth.

15:06.220 --> 15:09.029
I'll just get the water boiling.

15:09.049 --> 15:15.039
Soup a la smurf better be good,
or Bigmouth smash village.

15:15.059 --> 15:19.169
Salt, bay leaves, carrots,
onions

15:19.190 --> 15:22.139
and five healthy smurfs.

15:22.159 --> 15:25.000
'Any healthy volunteers?'

15:25.019 --> 15:26.190
Me first, Papa Smurf.

15:26.210 --> 15:27.179
And me.

15:27.200 --> 15:30.000
- Me.
- Uh, me too.

15:30.019 --> 15:31.169
I hate volunteering.

15:31.190 --> 15:34.230
Very good, brave Smurfs.
Hop to it.

15:37.100 --> 15:39.159
Yummy, yummy.

15:39.179 --> 15:43.039
Mm! The water's just perfect.

15:43.059 --> 15:44.179
Soup ready?

15:44.200 --> 15:47.039
(Papa Smurf)
Uh, no, no, no.
Just one more minute.

15:47.059 --> 15:49.120
Uh, time to get the smurfs
out of the pot.

15:49.139 --> 15:52.159
Uh, Mr. Bigmouth,
the water's not hot enough.

15:52.179 --> 15:54.200
We need more wood for the fire.

15:54.220 --> 15:56.000
Wood?

15:56.019 --> 15:59.000
You know,
the brown things in the forest.

15:59.019 --> 16:02.120
And since you're so big
and strong, maybe..

16:02.139 --> 16:06.100
Oh, Bigmouth get more wood.

16:07.159 --> 16:09.080
Quickly, everyone out.

16:11.029 --> 16:12.139
Hefty, the clothes.

16:15.230 --> 16:19.149
- It's ready.
- Call Bigmouth, Smurfette.

16:19.169 --> 16:24.029
Oh, yoo-hoo!
Mr. Bigmouth. Soup's on.

16:24.049 --> 16:26.000
More wood.

16:26.019 --> 16:27.129
[clamoring]

16:29.230 --> 16:32.090
[slurping]

16:32.110 --> 16:34.090
Well? How did you like it?

16:34.110 --> 16:37.090
[hiccups]
Too much salt.

16:37.110 --> 16:39.029
[hiccupping]

16:44.059 --> 16:45.100
Huh?

16:47.159 --> 16:52.159
Oh, it's no use, Azrael. We'll
never find the Smurf village.

16:52.179 --> 16:55.039
- We might as--
- 'Help!'

16:55.059 --> 16:58.190
(Bigmouth)
'Bigmouth sick.'

16:58.210 --> 17:00.080
It's Bigmouth.

17:01.169 --> 17:04.140
There's Bigmouth.
And there's the village!

17:04.160 --> 17:05.150
[laughs]

17:05.170 --> 17:08.079
Oh, this is too good to be true.

17:08.098 --> 17:09.190
[laughs]

17:09.210 --> 17:11.098
Too, too good.

17:11.118 --> 17:12.118
[laughs]

17:12.140 --> 17:14.098
[snarls]

17:18.220 --> 17:20.180
What happened?

17:20.200 --> 17:23.029
Bigmouth ugly.

17:23.049 --> 17:25.190
- Don't worry, that's normal.
- What?

17:25.210 --> 17:30.039
I mean, it always happens when
someone eats soup a la smurf.

17:30.059 --> 17:33.109
- Uh, didn't Gargamel tell you?
- No.

17:33.130 --> 17:36.210
Aha! Now I've got you,
you vile smurfs.

17:36.230 --> 17:38.059
Speak of the devil.

17:38.079 --> 17:41.190
Smurfs! Smurfs!
All the smurfs I could eat!

17:41.210 --> 17:43.190
Ha-ha-ha! Get them, Azrael.

17:44.109 --> 17:45.200
[mews]

17:45.220 --> 17:47.109
(Hefty)
It's Gargamel!

17:47.130 --> 17:49.220
[clamoring]

17:50.000 --> 17:54.029
Gargamel. He told Bigmouth
to eat smurf soup.

17:54.049 --> 17:56.089
Just ask Gargamel
for the antidote

17:56.109 --> 17:58.000
to make you normal again.

17:58.019 --> 18:01.109
But in the meantime, could you
get rid of this mean old cat?

18:01.130 --> 18:03.039
[snarls]

18:04.130 --> 18:06.000
Cat meat.

18:06.019 --> 18:08.069
I'll turn these
into smurf kebabs

18:08.089 --> 18:11.029
these into stew,
and these into pastry.

18:11.049 --> 18:13.160
And I'll keep one
for you too, Azrael.

18:13.180 --> 18:16.210
[chuckles]
Uh, Azrael? Where..

18:16.230 --> 18:18.230
[smurfs yelling]

18:19.009 --> 18:22.160
Uh, oh, well. It's, uh,
Bigmouth. Oh, heh-heh.

18:22.180 --> 18:25.130
'Uh, my, how you've changed.'

18:25.150 --> 18:27.079
Uh.. Oh, but not for the worse.

18:27.099 --> 18:29.170
Uh, actually, you look quite..

18:29.190 --> 18:31.029
[Azrael mews]

18:32.150 --> 18:36.170
Bigmouth ugly. Make anti-goat.

18:36.190 --> 18:38.069
Uh, anti-goat?

18:38.089 --> 18:41.200
Uh, b-but there's
nothing I can do. You see, I--

18:41.220 --> 18:45.230
You tell Bigmouth
to eat soup a la smurf.

18:46.009 --> 18:47.089
But-but-but, I-I..

18:47.109 --> 18:51.000
Make Bigmouth handsome again!

18:51.019 --> 18:55.130
But-but I don't know what the
anti-goat.. The antidote is.

18:55.150 --> 18:59.180
(all)
Oh, yes, he does. Yes, he does.

18:59.200 --> 19:02.049
Make anti-goat.

19:02.069 --> 19:05.109
B-b-but, but,
but th-that's impossible.

19:05.130 --> 19:09.009
(all)
No, it isn't. No, it isn't.

19:09.029 --> 19:11.099
Then throw you into forest.

19:12.230 --> 19:14.079
I'll make the antidote.

19:15.109 --> 19:16.160
Uh, yes, I'll..

19:16.180 --> 19:19.009
Oh, but, but, uh,
everything is at my place

19:19.029 --> 19:22.079
and, uh, I don't know
my way back.

19:22.099 --> 19:24.160
Uh, um..

19:24.180 --> 19:26.049
(Gargamel)
'Perhaps the smurfs'

19:26.069 --> 19:27.190
'can make me a little map'

19:27.210 --> 19:31.000
eh, from their village
to my estate.

19:31.019 --> 19:34.039
- Make map.
- Oh, it's very simple.

19:34.059 --> 19:37.170
Just turn left at the big oak
then follow a little path..

19:41.180 --> 19:44.119
I was just trying to be helpful.

19:44.140 --> 19:46.170
Give me a minute
to smurf something.

19:48.119 --> 19:49.200
[instrumental music]

19:52.130 --> 19:54.019
Oh, this is simple. Uh..

19:54.039 --> 19:57.099
Past the big oak and turn left,
then follow a little path.

19:57.119 --> 20:00.019
Eh, let's see now,
we turned right at the..

20:00.039 --> 20:02.000
No, no, no, no. No, it was left.

20:02.019 --> 20:04.220
Oh, or was it straight ahead?

20:05.000 --> 20:06.150
[mewing]

20:09.009 --> 20:13.230
(Bigmouth)
'Where anti-goat?
Bigmouth get mad.'

20:14.009 --> 20:17.089
And when Bigmouth get mad

20:17.109 --> 20:20.029
Bigmouth break things.

20:20.049 --> 20:22.109
Uh, k-k-keep your shirt on.

20:22.130 --> 20:24.089
I-i-it's nearly ready.

20:24.109 --> 20:26.099
Uh, what did he say?

20:26.119 --> 20:28.190
He said he's almost ready.

20:28.210 --> 20:30.150
[giggles]

20:30.170 --> 20:32.069
(Gargamel)
It's ready.

20:32.089 --> 20:33.190
Will it work?

20:33.210 --> 20:36.000
Oh, uh, well, of-of course.

20:36.019 --> 20:38.230
Ha, uh.. Abracadabra!

20:41.200 --> 20:43.069
[explosion]

20:43.089 --> 20:45.150
- Huh?
- Huh?

20:45.170 --> 20:47.200
[chuckling]

20:47.220 --> 20:52.160
Oh, my!

20:52.180 --> 20:54.079
[all laughing]

20:56.109 --> 20:59.039
I-I-I.. I-I'll try another one.

20:59.059 --> 21:03.029
(Bigmouth)
'Bigmouth mad now.'

21:03.049 --> 21:06.220
Uh, b-b-be patient.
T-t-this one won't fail.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.119
Oh, yes, it will.

21:08.140 --> 21:10.069
[giggles]

21:10.089 --> 21:12.000
[explosion]

21:12.019 --> 21:15.170
Now Bigmouth really mad.

21:15.190 --> 21:18.180
Eh, no, no, no. This is it.
I-I-I promise.

21:18.200 --> 21:20.210
Abracadabra!

21:23.140 --> 21:25.089
[explosion]

21:26.019 --> 21:27.079
[giggling]

21:27.099 --> 21:29.049
Uh, t-t-try this one.

21:29.069 --> 21:32.130
Uh, hocus pocus!

21:34.160 --> 21:37.029
[explosion]

21:37.049 --> 21:40.029
Bigmouth hate Gargamel.

21:40.049 --> 21:41.160
Me too.

21:41.180 --> 21:42.210
[chuckles]
I think Mr. Bigmouth

21:42.230 --> 21:45.099
has had enough.

21:45.119 --> 21:47.089
[groaning]

21:47.109 --> 21:51.049
Now, Gargamel, Bigmouth eat you.

21:51.069 --> 21:53.039
Uh, wait, Mr. Bigmouth.

21:55.029 --> 21:57.119
Eat this. It will cure you.

22:05.170 --> 22:08.019
Don't worry.
Papa Smurf won't fail.

22:09.119 --> 22:10.230
[explosion]

22:14.130 --> 22:17.160
Look. Bigmouth handsome again.

22:18.200 --> 22:20.140
Mwah. Mwah. Mwah.

22:20.160 --> 22:22.140
But-but, but what was that?

22:22.160 --> 22:26.019
A sarsaparilla leaf.
They're all over the forest.

22:26.039 --> 22:28.220
Uh, a sarsaparilla leaf?

22:31.079 --> 22:34.130
No. It's not true.
It's not true.

22:35.160 --> 22:38.079
Bigmouth still hungry.

22:38.099 --> 22:40.089
Uh-oh! Let me out of here.

22:40.109 --> 22:42.200
[clamoring]

22:42.220 --> 22:46.109
No, no. Uh, you wouldn't
like me. Uh, much too salty.

22:46.130 --> 22:47.220
Uh, look..

22:48.000 --> 22:50.069
Why don't you grab a few smurfs
and, uh..

22:50.089 --> 22:52.200
How about the cat?

22:52.220 --> 22:57.049
No smurfs. No cat.
Want Gargamel.

22:59.099 --> 23:02.160
(Bigmouth)
Me hungry!

23:02.180 --> 23:05.150
I wonder what soup
a la Gargamel tastes like.

23:05.170 --> 23:08.079
Oh, yuck. Probably greasy.

23:08.099 --> 23:10.099
[all laughing]

23:13.049 --> 23:15.069
[theme music]
