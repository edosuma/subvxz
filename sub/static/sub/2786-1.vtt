01:40.600 --> 01:42.111
God.

01:42.280 --> 01:44.382
Okay. Okay.

01:45.720 --> 01:48.949
"I'd rather be
a hammer than a nail."

01:59.920 --> 02:01.829
No.

02:02.120 --> 02:04.109
No.

02:16.240 --> 02:18.820
Fuck you, bitch!

02:58.440 --> 03:00.144
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

03:06.640 --> 03:07.940
Hi.

03:08.040 --> 03:10.020
I need a room for the night.

03:10.120 --> 03:11.665
$18.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.260
Unless, uh... you have
a companion joining you later.

03:14.360 --> 03:15.860
If you have
a companion, it's more.

03:15.960 --> 03:17.585
I don't have a companion.

03:17.800 --> 03:20.710
So it's $18.

03:21.440 --> 03:22.701
For now.

03:23.680 --> 03:25.066
It'll stay $18.

03:26.120 --> 03:27.745
Unless someone comes later.

03:28.160 --> 03:29.546
Which he won't.

03:30.520 --> 03:31.820
He may.

03:31.920 --> 03:35.662
To throw out certain
evidence obtained at O.J. Simpson's house.

03:36.160 --> 03:37.830
Um, I'm hiking the PCT.

03:39.440 --> 03:43.431
And, um, I don't have a license
plate number or an address.

03:43.560 --> 03:45.230
Just put down your folks'
address.

04:02.440 --> 04:03.940
- Hello.
- Hey.

04:05.760 --> 04:07.260
Oh, hey.

04:07.360 --> 04:08.586
Hi.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.140
Hey.

04:10.240 --> 04:11.705
Y-You in Mojave?

04:12.160 --> 04:14.540
Yeah. Um, I used your address

04:14.640 --> 04:17.141
as my address on the registration
form 'cause I...

04:18.000 --> 04:19.261
I couldn't think
of anything else.

04:19.720 --> 04:21.788
No, that's cool. Anytime.

04:23.720 --> 04:26.100
Hey, if you see my little brother,
will you let him know where I am?

04:26.200 --> 04:29.340
Not that he would give a shit,
but I just want him to know.

04:29.440 --> 04:31.304
No, he does, he will.

04:32.200 --> 04:35.420
Um, listen, I'm making dinner
for a friend, and, uh...

04:35.520 --> 04:36.985
Oh. Which friend?

04:39.320 --> 04:40.660
Does it make any difference?

04:42.960 --> 04:46.462
You know, I only called
because I was looking for Leif.

04:46.960 --> 04:48.780
No, I want you to call.
I want you to call.

04:48.880 --> 04:50.470
We're friends, remember?

04:52.240 --> 04:53.705
Sorry.

04:53.920 --> 04:55.590
No, I'm sorry.

04:56.720 --> 04:57.821
For what?

04:59.560 --> 05:01.025
I-I don't know.

05:02.880 --> 05:05.711
I'm-I'm sorry, uh...

05:06.840 --> 05:10.103
that you have to walk
a thousand miles just to...

05:11.920 --> 05:13.749
Finish that sentence.

05:14.240 --> 05:16.627
Why do I have to walk
a thousand miles?

05:23.080 --> 05:25.990
Uh, do you have the list
of addresses to write to?

05:26.600 --> 05:27.740
Yeah. Yeah.

05:27.840 --> 05:29.780
Do you want me to send
anything else?

05:29.880 --> 05:31.300
Uh, no, thanks.

05:31.400 --> 05:33.502
Aimee's in charge
of all the boxes.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.909
Okay. Okay.

05:36.240 --> 05:37.865
Um...

05:38.880 --> 05:40.391
I got to go.

05:42.480 --> 05:44.300
Happy trails, Cheryl.

05:57.840 --> 06:00.511
Remember, you
can quit anytime.

07:43.720 --> 07:45.185
Shit.

07:52.520 --> 07:54.622
Oh, my God.

08:09.960 --> 08:11.266
Shit!

08:16.600 --> 08:17.826
Okay.

10:15.400 --> 10:16.500
So where are you going?

10:16.600 --> 10:18.580
I'm hiking
the Pacific Crest Trail.

10:18.680 --> 10:21.147
It goes from the Mexican
border up to Canada.

10:21.320 --> 10:23.149
I'll be walking
for the next three months.

10:23.280 --> 10:24.260
Wow.

10:24.360 --> 10:25.541
Up to Ashland.

10:26.200 --> 10:27.381
You do a lot of hiking?

10:27.720 --> 10:28.660
Well, I mean,

10:28.760 --> 10:32.307
I'm not obsessive, but this
is quite a stretch, even for me.

10:32.880 --> 10:36.144
I guess we're gonna be the last human
contact you have for a while, huh?

10:36.480 --> 10:37.991
That's true.

10:50.280 --> 10:53.224
You can never.

10:53.920 --> 10:58.389
Go home anymore.

10:59.120 --> 11:00.426
Listen.

11:00.840 --> 11:02.942
Does this sound familiar?

11:03.520 --> 11:05.660
You wake up every morning.

11:05.760 --> 11:07.703
Go to school every day.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.060
Spend your nights on the corner.

11:10.160 --> 11:12.149
Just passing time away.

11:13.360 --> 11:15.060
Your life is so lonely.

11:15.160 --> 11:17.422
Like a child without a toy.

11:18.280 --> 11:19.820
Then a miracle.

11:19.920 --> 11:21.590
A boy.

11:24.400 --> 11:26.468
And that's called "glad".

11:28.080 --> 11:31.229
Never.

11:31.480 --> 11:35.505
Go home anymore.

11:36.440 --> 11:38.190
Now...

11:44.120 --> 11:46.222
Love you, too, son.

12:47.920 --> 12:50.830
"If your Nerve, deny
you, Go above your Nerve."

12:52.440 --> 12:55.271
Emily Dickinson. And
Cheryl Strayed.

13:12.280 --> 13:13.825
Oh, my God.

13:14.240 --> 13:16.229
What the fuck have I done?

13:18.400 --> 13:21.470
What... The fuck?

13:22.320 --> 13:23.780
What...

13:23.880 --> 13:25.425
The fuck?

13:25.560 --> 13:27.503
What the fuck?

13:35.360 --> 13:37.064
You can quit anytime.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.025
You can quit...

13:39.160 --> 13:40.386
anytime.

13:41.240 --> 13:43.020
You can quit...

13:43.120 --> 13:44.346
anytime.

15:29.960 --> 15:31.391
Yes!

15:32.520 --> 15:34.224
Shit.

15:42.720 --> 15:44.231
Jesus fucking Christ.

15:44.520 --> 15:45.951
Yes, I would

15:48.360 --> 15:50.986
If I could

15:51.520 --> 15:53.900
I surely would

16:29.040 --> 16:31.746
I thought of you today.

16:32.400 --> 16:34.502
I felt a burst of energy,

16:35.280 --> 16:38.350
remembering why I thought
I could hike this trail.

16:38.760 --> 16:42.342
I hope you won't be
mad at me if I quit.

16:48.240 --> 16:52.180
"Today a backhoe divulged
out of a crumbling flank of earth,"

16:52.280 --> 16:54.700
"one bottle amber, perfect,"

16:54.800 --> 16:58.380
"a hundred-year-old cure
for fever or melancholy..."

16:58.480 --> 17:01.186
"A tonic for living
on this earth."

17:02.040 --> 17:04.339
"Today I was reading
about Marie Curie."

17:04.440 --> 17:08.589
"She died a famous
woman, denying her wounds..."

17:09.119 --> 17:11.951
"Denying her wounds came
from the same source"

17:13.079 --> 17:14.944
"as her power."

17:17.200 --> 17:18.540
So, what did he say?

17:18.640 --> 17:19.859
He said he was going
to call you.

17:19.960 --> 17:21.900
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I know.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.545
Does he think
we're in junior high?

17:24.119 --> 17:25.220
Exactly!

17:25.319 --> 17:27.502
I think he's going
to ask for your number!

17:28.960 --> 17:30.060
Bobbi?

17:30.160 --> 17:31.625
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:33.600 --> 17:35.589
- How's it going?
- Good.

17:35.800 --> 17:38.187
Hard but fun.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.100
All right. See you.

17:42.200 --> 17:43.506
Yeah, cool.

17:46.040 --> 17:48.188
I'm just gonna
grab this for a second.

17:52.480 --> 17:54.264
I'm sorry I ignored
you at school today.

17:55.320 --> 17:57.024
That's okay, hon.

17:57.600 --> 17:58.900
We agreed, right?

17:59.000 --> 18:01.467
It's pretty strange going
to school with your mom.

18:02.160 --> 18:04.183
It's not because I'm
not proud of you.

18:06.160 --> 18:08.183
I'm really proud of you.

18:08.960 --> 18:11.745
You know what? I'm
pretty proud of me, too.

18:12.320 --> 18:13.940
God, there's so much to know.

18:14.040 --> 18:16.460
I mean, I knew there
was a lot, but...

18:16.560 --> 18:18.580
not this much.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.700
- You've read Erica Jong, right?
- Mm-hmm.

18:20.800 --> 18:23.631
Okay, so tell me
about the zipless fuck.

18:23.840 --> 18:26.780
Mom, I am not gonna discuss
zipless fucks with you.

18:26.880 --> 18:29.140
Uh, you have to, 'cause I have
to write a paper about it.

18:30.560 --> 18:31.780
I mean, you know, is it...

18:31.880 --> 18:33.580
- This is so awkward.
- That much easier for women now

18:33.680 --> 18:35.180
- than it was before?
- I don't know.

18:35.280 --> 18:36.820
Can we not discuss this?

18:36.920 --> 18:40.620
Well, for me, it felt like it
was always covered in zips.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.420
Zips, strings,
everywhere I went.

18:43.520 --> 18:44.540
Hey.

18:44.640 --> 18:45.860
What's for dinner,
Mom? I'm starving.

18:45.960 --> 18:47.580
Books and essays.

18:47.680 --> 18:48.780
I can fix something.

18:48.880 --> 18:50.900
Are you gonna stay, Wayne?
You want something to eat?

18:51.000 --> 18:52.980
- Um, sure.
- Mom, they are 18 years old.

18:53.080 --> 18:54.540
They can cook their own dinner.

18:54.640 --> 18:56.780
You've got a paper to write.

18:56.880 --> 18:57.860
Uh-uh.

18:57.960 --> 18:59.980
If I can't be a mom, then
I can't be a student, either.

19:00.080 --> 19:01.100
Rule book.

19:01.200 --> 19:02.340
That's ridiculous.

19:02.440 --> 19:05.340
If she wants to make me
dinner, then let her.

19:05.440 --> 19:07.100
I wonder, have
you learned any of this

19:07.200 --> 19:09.140
- that we're reading?
- You know, I have to do everything.

19:09.240 --> 19:10.500
I want to do everything.

19:10.600 --> 19:12.304
I hope you do, too.

19:12.680 --> 19:14.020
Pasta?

19:16.160 --> 19:17.420
"Denying her wounds"

19:17.520 --> 19:19.429
"came from her power."

19:21.720 --> 19:25.586
"Denying her wounds came
from the same source as her power."

19:35.000 --> 19:38.070
And you want to travel blind...

20:07.760 --> 20:09.385
I'm not afraid.

20:10.800 --> 20:12.390
I'm not afraid.

20:30.840 --> 20:33.500
"Please ensure that you
only use white gas"

20:33.600 --> 20:35.420
"compatible with this stove."

20:35.520 --> 20:36.980
"Other fuels may
harm the equipment"

20:37.080 --> 20:39.262
"and render it inoperable."

20:40.680 --> 20:42.305
Shit.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.181
Shit!

21:02.840 --> 21:04.544
Cold mush is great.

21:07.520 --> 21:09.622
Cold mush with nuts.

21:14.880 --> 21:17.142
Cold mush with tuna jerky.

21:24.080 --> 21:25.511
Cold mush dreams.

21:28.880 --> 21:30.141
Cold mush shit.

21:32.280 --> 21:33.791
I love cold mush.

21:36.200 --> 21:39.349
"What do you like to do when
you're not hiking, Cheryl?"

21:39.960 --> 21:42.301
I like to sit on a real toilet.

21:43.040 --> 21:44.869
And flush.

21:45.240 --> 21:46.990
I like to cook food.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.986
Eat food with other people.

21:50.640 --> 21:52.708
People, that's another thing
I like.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.669
I like talking to people,

21:56.120 --> 21:57.949
listening to people.

21:58.480 --> 22:02.062
Funny, that's a hobby,
one I hadn't even realized I had.

22:04.360 --> 22:07.987
Until I decided to walk
on my own through the fucking desert.

22:20.520 --> 22:22.622
We got to feed you, kid.

22:31.640 --> 22:33.504
Should I stay or should I go?

22:42.480 --> 22:46.380
I'd rather be a sparrow than a snail.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.390
Yes, I would

23:00.800 --> 23:02.311
Hey!

23:04.720 --> 23:05.867
Hey!

23:15.560 --> 23:16.741
Hi!

23:17.160 --> 23:18.700
My name is Cheryl.

23:18.800 --> 23:22.029
I'm walking the PCT,
and I've run out of food.

23:22.640 --> 23:26.024
I'm just wondering if you could take
me someplace I could get a warm meal.

23:26.320 --> 23:27.626
I'm working.

23:29.840 --> 23:31.783
Yeah, I understand. Um...

23:31.920 --> 23:34.341
But maybe when you're finished,
you could take me somewhere?

23:35.160 --> 23:37.149
Not gonna find anything
open this time of day.

23:38.320 --> 23:40.500
Well, maybe you
could just drive me

23:40.600 --> 23:42.500
to someplace that'd be open
in the morning for breakfast,

23:42.600 --> 23:44.862
and I can camp nearby.

23:45.880 --> 23:47.060
You must be starving.

23:47.160 --> 23:49.900
I brought all these dehydrated
meals, and I brought a stove,

23:50.000 --> 23:51.340
but I brought the wrong fuel.

23:51.440 --> 23:53.940
Yeah, I got a little bit
more work to do,

23:54.040 --> 23:56.381
but you can wait in my truck.

23:56.840 --> 23:58.305
Thank you.

23:58.840 --> 24:00.660
- Thank you, sir.
- Yeah.

24:41.760 --> 24:43.510
All right, I've been thinking.

24:44.320 --> 24:46.980
You can come back to my place

24:47.080 --> 24:49.342
for a hot dinner
and a hot shower.

24:50.720 --> 24:52.060
Okay.

24:53.080 --> 24:55.182
So, what kind of woman are you?

24:57.040 --> 24:57.980
What kind?

24:58.080 --> 24:59.944
Yeah. Are you like a Jane?

25:01.520 --> 25:03.300
You know, Tarzan's Jane.

25:03.400 --> 25:04.820
Are you a Jane?

25:04.920 --> 25:06.545
A wild woman?

25:07.240 --> 25:08.940
I got a little something for us.

25:10.680 --> 25:12.460
That is, if you partake.

25:12.560 --> 25:13.741
Sure.

25:15.120 --> 25:16.585
Ladies first.

25:17.640 --> 25:19.742
- Oh.
- It's cheap, but it's good.

25:25.120 --> 25:26.220
See?

25:27.960 --> 25:29.100
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

25:29.200 --> 25:30.665
I'm gonna call you Jane.

25:33.680 --> 25:36.067
Yeah, my husband's hiking
the PCT with me.

25:36.360 --> 25:38.827
He's just a little bit
further ahead on the trail.

25:39.400 --> 25:40.831
We're gonna meet up really soon.

25:41.240 --> 25:42.860
Probably around Kennedy Meadows.

25:42.960 --> 25:47.110
I got a little something else
I like to do after a hard day's work.

25:51.040 --> 25:52.869
You like licorice?

25:54.120 --> 25:56.109
Oh, thanks.

25:56.560 --> 25:57.660
Come on.

25:57.760 --> 25:59.220
Come on, Jane!

26:01.280 --> 26:02.660
All right, you got to promise

26:02.760 --> 26:04.140
that you're not
gonna tell my wife,

26:04.240 --> 26:06.149
because she hates it
when I eat candy.

26:07.480 --> 26:08.627
Okay.

26:36.160 --> 26:37.910
What, you just
gonna stand there?

26:44.880 --> 26:47.140
Oh, um, hold
on, sweetheart.

26:47.240 --> 26:48.990
No offense, but...

26:54.680 --> 26:56.509
Thank you.

27:03.320 --> 27:05.260
Well, you just
gonna look at it or...

27:05.360 --> 27:07.462
Thank you.

27:09.720 --> 27:11.310
Good meal.

27:23.240 --> 27:25.741
So, your husband,

27:25.920 --> 27:27.829
the two of you meet in college?

27:30.280 --> 27:31.820
- Your husband.
- Oh, Paul?

27:31.920 --> 27:33.420
- Yeah.
- Yes.

27:33.520 --> 27:34.460
Yeah.

27:34.560 --> 27:36.503
Well, he must be crazy.

27:37.800 --> 27:40.860
It's one thing for a man to take
off on a hike like that,

27:40.960 --> 27:42.780
but to allow your wife to do it?

27:42.880 --> 27:44.340
Whole other thing entirely.

27:44.440 --> 27:47.340
Not everyone in the world
thinks like you do, Frank.

27:47.440 --> 27:49.780
Nope, that's why everything
is so messed up.

27:51.280 --> 27:53.860
Paul and I kind of do
our own thing.

27:56.120 --> 27:57.860
Don't you get any ideas.

27:57.960 --> 27:59.903
How could I possibly?

28:01.640 --> 28:02.901
You gonna take off with her?

28:05.920 --> 28:07.220
You have an extra tent?

28:07.320 --> 28:08.820
You'd be yelling for me

28:08.920 --> 28:11.180
to come get you before you got
to the end of the driveway.

28:11.280 --> 28:13.189
This is really good.

28:31.800 --> 28:37.862
Baby, baby, be my friend.

28:46.480 --> 28:49.540
So, what does this tattoo
mean to you guys, anyways?

28:49.640 --> 28:51.902
Well, we both just
really dig horses.

28:53.760 --> 28:55.703
We're getting divorced today

28:56.280 --> 28:59.668
and we thought we should do
something that bonded us together.

29:00.600 --> 29:01.747
Oh.

29:02.440 --> 29:03.905
Okay.

29:06.920 --> 29:11.184
It hasn't occurred to you guys that it
might be easier just to stay married?

29:11.680 --> 29:13.140
- Cheaper, too.
- Mmm.

29:13.240 --> 29:14.466
At least we probably
won't regret it.

29:15.160 --> 29:18.140
Couples don't necessarily stay married,
but they tend to stay divorced.

29:19.360 --> 29:21.580
You get a lot of people asking
you about removing tattoos?

29:21.680 --> 29:22.740
Well, sometimes.

29:22.840 --> 29:24.590
I cheated on him.

29:28.120 --> 29:29.346
It happens.

29:30.360 --> 29:31.300
She seems sorry.

29:31.400 --> 29:32.580
I am sorry.

29:32.680 --> 29:34.020
Cheryl, come on, can we just...

29:34.880 --> 29:36.260
Come on, man, wipe
the slate clean.

29:36.360 --> 29:38.588
Uh, it's quite a big slate.

29:38.760 --> 29:41.181
I cheated on him a lot of times.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.980
Is that right? "Stryed"?

29:49.080 --> 29:50.625
Uh, no, it's "strayed."

29:50.920 --> 29:52.181
Like a stray dog.

29:53.600 --> 29:56.021
The form asked me what my new
last name would be. I...

29:56.600 --> 29:57.861
I looked it up.

29:58.640 --> 30:00.663
It just sounded right.

30:02.240 --> 30:03.546
You're all set.

30:05.040 --> 30:06.790
You're going to have
to mail them yourselves.

30:15.800 --> 30:17.540
It's been a wonderful
and crazy seven years.

30:32.400 --> 30:33.661
Goodbye,

30:34.000 --> 30:35.181
Cheryl Strayed.

31:11.800 --> 31:12.780
Got what you needed?

31:12.880 --> 31:14.180
Yes.

31:14.280 --> 31:15.620
Now I don't have to eat
cold mush anymore.

31:15.720 --> 31:16.946
I can eat hot mush.

31:24.720 --> 31:26.948
There's no husband, is there?

31:28.960 --> 31:30.900
No. I mean, there was,

31:31.000 --> 31:34.229
but he's in Minneapolis,
not on the PCT.

31:36.120 --> 31:38.427
I said that 'cause
I was scared of you.

31:39.240 --> 31:40.387
Yeah, I knew that.

31:40.840 --> 31:41.900
Can't say I blame you.

31:45.480 --> 31:46.700
Do you ever think
about quitting?

31:46.800 --> 31:49.585
Oh, only once
every two minutes or so.

31:50.320 --> 31:52.900
Everything hurts. All the time.

31:54.800 --> 31:57.301
- You think I should quit?
- Yes, I do.

32:01.160 --> 32:03.700
Don't listen to me. Hell,
I've quit a bunch of stuff.

32:03.800 --> 32:05.580
Quit jobs, quit marriages.

32:05.680 --> 32:07.782
I'd have quit that hike
after the first day.

32:09.680 --> 32:11.300
You regret any of them?

32:11.400 --> 32:13.100
I didn't have a choice.

32:13.200 --> 32:15.587
I just couldn't do them no more.

32:16.120 --> 32:19.429
Never been a time when there
was a fork in my road.

32:21.600 --> 32:22.747
Yeah.

32:23.080 --> 32:25.308
That's about the size of it.

32:27.360 --> 32:28.580
Be careful.

32:28.680 --> 32:30.140
- All right.
- Nice meeting you.

32:30.240 --> 32:32.308
Nice meeting you.
Thank you, Frank!

32:58.400 --> 32:59.581
Yes!

33:07.240 --> 33:08.466
Okay.

33:16.840 --> 33:18.300
Oh, my God.

33:18.400 --> 33:19.911
Oh, my God!

33:45.280 --> 33:46.461
You're doing good, Strayed.

33:47.240 --> 33:49.388
Five to seven miles a day.

33:50.200 --> 33:53.180
At this rate, you'll be
finished in about 20 years.

34:29.480 --> 34:31.105
I'm not hungry.

34:32.320 --> 34:33.831
I don't miss food.

34:35.840 --> 34:38.420
I don't miss tacos,
chips and guac.

34:40.239 --> 34:42.627
I don't miss Minneapolis
snow, that's for sure.

34:44.840 --> 34:46.429
I don't miss margaritas.

34:48.480 --> 34:50.340
I'd kill a snake for a sip.

35:49.680 --> 35:51.703
It's not like I'm
some junkie. I'm in control.

35:51.840 --> 35:53.430
Yeah, like everyone
is with drugs?

35:53.600 --> 35:55.140
- I'm an experimentalist.
- Mmm.

35:55.240 --> 35:57.741
I'm the girl who says
yes instead of no.

36:26.520 --> 36:27.701
Uh, hi!

36:28.520 --> 36:29.667
Cheryl Strayed?

36:30.280 --> 36:31.620
Oh, yeah, hi!

36:31.720 --> 36:33.140
I... Do I know you?

36:33.240 --> 36:35.263
I... I saw your name
in the trail register.

36:36.080 --> 36:37.340
You're the only woman in there.

36:37.440 --> 36:38.587
Right.

36:38.800 --> 36:39.981
I'm Greg!

36:40.360 --> 36:41.586
Nice to meet you!

36:42.440 --> 36:43.701
I'm coming down.

36:44.520 --> 36:45.667
Oh, great!

36:48.840 --> 36:51.705
Sorry. I wasn't
expecting any visitors.

36:56.440 --> 36:58.860
So how many miles
a day are you doing?

36:58.960 --> 37:01.267
I'm averaging 22 at the moment.

37:03.640 --> 37:05.390
You'll be in Kennedy
Meadows by tomorrow?

37:05.760 --> 37:06.907
Hope so.

37:09.840 --> 37:11.180
I'm only managing about...

37:11.840 --> 37:13.146
11 or 12.

37:13.360 --> 37:16.580
Uh, well, the first couple
of weeks are always hard.

37:16.680 --> 37:19.300
And you do all that preparation
and training,

37:19.400 --> 37:22.106
and nothing prepares you
for the pain and the heat.

37:24.560 --> 37:26.700
Yeah, we picked
the wrong year, though.

37:26.800 --> 37:28.789
You, uh... bypassing the Sierra?

37:29.840 --> 37:30.900
Sure.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.784
I'll bypass anything. Should I?

37:33.680 --> 37:35.544
Oh, it's completely socked in.

37:36.320 --> 37:38.260
Biggest snowfall
in a decade or so.

37:38.360 --> 37:40.906
Yeah, nobody's getting
through that.

37:44.640 --> 37:45.787
Say, uh...

37:45.920 --> 37:49.100
how 'bout we make a plan
up in Kennedy Meadows?

37:49.200 --> 37:52.144
I'm... I'm staying there
for a few days to rest up.

37:52.640 --> 37:53.580
Yeah.

37:53.680 --> 37:54.861
Thanks.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.540
Let's make a plan. I...

37:56.640 --> 37:57.787
Think that'd be good for me.

37:58.400 --> 37:59.661
Great.

38:16.600 --> 38:17.747
I think I'm pregnant.

38:19.600 --> 38:20.747
What?

38:22.920 --> 38:24.700
Who's the father?

38:24.800 --> 38:25.981
I don't know.

38:26.720 --> 38:27.867
I mean...

38:28.680 --> 38:30.180
I think I have an idea.

38:30.280 --> 38:31.984
You have an idea?

38:32.400 --> 38:34.662
Are you fucking kidding me?

38:35.600 --> 38:37.941
What are you doing to yourself?

38:41.680 --> 38:44.021
Can we have the check, please?

38:44.280 --> 38:47.031
Shit. Pregnancy
test and a shovel.

38:48.120 --> 38:50.540
You're going to do this in front
of me, and if you're pregnant,

38:50.640 --> 38:54.108
we're gonna pay visit
to your "idea" and make a plan.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.909
Next please!

39:02.920 --> 39:07.264
Give me a reason to love you.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.180
This is the beginning.

39:13.280 --> 39:17.351
Of forever and ever

39:24.560 --> 39:27.186
It's time to move over.

39:29.800 --> 39:33.302
It's all I want to be.

39:34.280 --> 39:38.624
Give me a reason to love you.

39:42.280 --> 39:47.910
Give me a reason to be.

39:49.120 --> 39:51.382
A woman

39:55.960 --> 39:58.700
I just wanna be a woman.

39:58.800 --> 40:00.580
There's no plan to make.

40:01.800 --> 40:04.187
I'm not gonna have this baby.

40:07.080 --> 40:10.263
I don't know when I became
such a piece of shit.

40:10.920 --> 40:12.226
I was strong...

40:13.120 --> 40:15.109
Responsible.

40:15.640 --> 40:17.708
I wanted things in life.

40:18.520 --> 40:20.429
I was good, you know?

40:21.280 --> 40:22.460
I ruined my marriage,

40:22.560 --> 40:24.662
and now I'm ruining
the rest of my life.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.943
I gotta go back to that store.

40:31.120 --> 40:32.940
I'm gonna walk myself
back to the woman

40:33.040 --> 40:34.585
my mother thought I was.

40:37.720 --> 40:39.629
I'm gonna put myself
in the way of beauty.

40:40.200 --> 40:43.270
What the hell
are you talking about?

40:48.920 --> 40:52.183
In the way
of another fucking giant rock.

42:03.120 --> 42:05.951
Maybe
your other girlfriends.

42:07.600 --> 42:10.180
Couldn't pass the test.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.387
Come on, Bruce. Sing with me.

42:19.840 --> 42:23.501
Well, if you're rough and ready for love.

42:24.680 --> 42:27.980
Honey, I'm
tougher than...

42:28.080 --> 42:29.386
The rest

42:48.240 --> 42:49.387
Hey, there.

42:54.840 --> 42:56.140
There she is!

42:56.240 --> 42:57.421
Hey!

42:57.960 --> 42:59.869
- You made it!
- I made it!

43:00.480 --> 43:01.627
Okay, guys?

43:02.040 --> 43:03.187
This is Cheryl.

43:03.640 --> 43:04.821
And Monster.

43:05.680 --> 43:06.781
"Monster"?

43:07.320 --> 43:08.467
My pack?

43:08.960 --> 43:10.180
Oh, man.

43:11.840 --> 43:13.580
Okay,

43:13.680 --> 43:14.827
what can I get you?

43:16.360 --> 43:19.350
Snapple. I've been dreaming
of Snapple Lemonade.

43:19.840 --> 43:22.300
And potato chips. Any
kind of potato chips.

43:22.400 --> 43:23.380
- Any kind?
- Thank you.

43:23.480 --> 43:25.580
- I have cash.
- No, no, no! My treat.

43:25.680 --> 43:26.781
Ah, thank you.

43:29.680 --> 43:31.940
Seriously, you have no
Snapple in that pack?

43:32.040 --> 43:33.710
I wish!

43:36.360 --> 43:37.340
Stay.

43:37.440 --> 43:38.780
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

43:38.880 --> 43:41.140
I wish I'd gotten applause
like that when I walked in.

43:42.360 --> 43:45.260
Okay! I know they said
don't feed the animals,

43:45.360 --> 43:47.620
but I figured this would be
a special occasion.

43:47.720 --> 43:49.948
One Snapple and chips.

43:50.880 --> 43:52.391
Ah! That's perfect.

43:54.200 --> 43:55.740
When you're done
here, Ed over there

43:55.840 --> 43:58.181
will cook you dinner
down at the campsite.

43:58.680 --> 43:59.820
That would be amazing.

43:59.920 --> 44:01.021
Thank you.

44:01.520 --> 44:03.700
Ed is amazing. We
call him Amazing Ed.

44:18.280 --> 44:19.427
Sweetheart.

44:23.280 --> 44:25.420
If you're reading this, then
you've walked 100 miles

44:25.520 --> 44:27.540
through the Mojave Desert.

44:27.640 --> 44:28.980
Whatever else has
happened between us,

44:29.080 --> 44:31.500
however angry we are,
or were, at each other,

44:31.600 --> 44:35.625
I am so proud of you
and in awe of you.

44:35.920 --> 44:38.421
Or, I will be, once
you've done it.

44:39.040 --> 44:40.500
As I write,
you've only just left,

44:40.600 --> 44:43.020
so actually, you've done
almost nothing at all.

44:43.120 --> 44:44.380
Like me!

44:44.480 --> 44:46.180
So we can still be friends.

44:46.280 --> 44:47.791
Minneapolis misses you.

44:59.960 --> 45:01.061
Hey, Cheryl!

45:02.120 --> 45:03.631
- Come and get it!
- Okay, great!

45:04.880 --> 45:05.980
So you're not a hiker?

45:06.080 --> 45:07.341
Not like you.

45:08.280 --> 45:10.740
I just come up here every summer
to hang out with the real hikers.

45:10.840 --> 45:12.590
You fascinate me.

45:13.040 --> 45:14.740
I'm not a real hiker.

45:14.840 --> 45:17.180
You just hiked 100 miles
through the desert heat.

45:17.280 --> 45:19.223
And it nearly killed me.

45:21.640 --> 45:22.741
You want some help?

45:24.320 --> 45:26.422
Do I look like somebody
who needs help?

45:29.680 --> 45:31.380
Your boots. They're too small.

45:31.480 --> 45:33.503
That's why you're
losing toenails.

45:34.640 --> 45:36.424
Yeah. You're right.

45:37.520 --> 45:40.340
I only just realized it
the second you said that.

45:40.440 --> 45:42.540
I thought they were
supposed to hurt that bad.

45:42.640 --> 45:43.660
What am I supposed to do?

45:43.760 --> 45:45.300
I don't have any money
to buy new boots.

45:45.400 --> 45:47.582
- Did you get them at REI?
- Yeah.

45:47.920 --> 45:50.060
Well, you call 'em, you tell
'em, and they'll have new boots

45:50.160 --> 45:51.300
sent to your next stop.

45:51.400 --> 45:52.945
- Seriously?
- Mmm.

45:54.120 --> 45:55.824
And your pack, it's insane.

45:56.240 --> 45:58.183
We need to do a little pruning.

45:58.680 --> 45:59.980
Okay, so I'm gonna pick out

46:00.080 --> 46:01.860
the stuff that's useless to you.

46:01.960 --> 46:04.580
And you can leave it in the free box
unless you can give me a good reason

46:04.680 --> 46:05.861
why you need it with you.

46:06.000 --> 46:07.181
- Okay?
- Okay.

46:09.800 --> 46:11.106
Ah, how's this working for you?

46:11.840 --> 46:13.020
I stink.

46:13.120 --> 46:16.781
I stink all the time. And
my armpits are the least of it.

46:17.040 --> 46:18.780
Are you having much
fun with these?

46:18.880 --> 46:21.028
I've never used them once.

46:27.080 --> 46:30.184
I don't know what I was thinking
with the saw.

46:34.600 --> 46:36.060
You burning what you read?

46:36.160 --> 46:37.180
You want me to burn books?

46:37.280 --> 46:39.620
I know you're not gonna
become a Nazi, I promise you.

46:39.720 --> 46:42.140
But you are gonna make
your pack a lot lighter.

46:42.240 --> 46:45.105
Okay? So... Everything
before Kennedy Meadows...

46:49.560 --> 46:50.707
Wait. Not those.

46:52.240 --> 46:53.860
These will never be burned.

46:53.960 --> 46:55.710
It's your weight.

46:57.720 --> 47:00.107
I don't take pictures at night.

47:01.440 --> 47:02.621
Never.

47:07.520 --> 47:09.820
You... You need the whole roll?

47:11.760 --> 47:13.940
What woman goes on a hike
and brings 12 condoms.

47:14.040 --> 47:15.744
Hey, Ed!

47:15.960 --> 47:17.107
Wait just a minute.

47:25.200 --> 47:26.340
But you'll just send
the boots there?

47:26.440 --> 47:28.668
I don't have to do anything?

47:29.400 --> 47:30.540
Thank you so much.

47:30.640 --> 47:33.869
You will be my favorite
company forever and ever.

47:34.880 --> 47:36.027
Okay.

47:36.760 --> 47:37.861
Great.

47:53.520 --> 47:54.940
So what's wrong
with James Michener?

47:55.040 --> 47:57.222
He's crap is what's wrong.

47:57.440 --> 47:59.380
And which of his books have
you read that are so...

47:59.480 --> 48:00.820
I haven't read any of his books.

48:00.920 --> 48:02.620
I read things like Adrienne Rich

48:02.720 --> 48:04.060
and Flannery O'Connor.

48:04.160 --> 48:06.020
Which you do, too,
now, by the way.

48:06.120 --> 48:08.380
Doesn't it make
a difference to you?

48:08.480 --> 48:10.264
Um... I don't know what to say.

48:11.240 --> 48:12.944
I love James Michener!

48:13.160 --> 48:15.020
And I'm not going to stop
loving him!

48:17.800 --> 48:19.740
It must be so weird for you.

48:19.840 --> 48:21.101
What?

48:22.440 --> 48:26.025
That I'm just so much more sophisticated
than you were at my age, you know?

48:30.320 --> 48:32.422
Yeah, that was the plan.

48:33.320 --> 48:35.100
What was the plan?

48:35.200 --> 48:38.702
I always wanted you to be
more sophisticated than me.

48:39.160 --> 48:41.706
I just didn't realize it
would hurt sometimes.

48:46.880 --> 48:49.460
Why do you
put up with my crap?

48:50.400 --> 48:52.867
You look so pretty
in that dress.

48:54.360 --> 48:56.940
And I'll make you
another one soon.

48:59.200 --> 49:01.621
What'd you decide
about the snow?

49:01.760 --> 49:03.942
Well, I'd like to push
on, if it's possible.

49:04.480 --> 49:06.981
Well, Ed told me
a lot of the hikers

49:07.360 --> 49:09.740
went up the PCT another 40
miles to Trail Pass.

49:09.840 --> 49:11.260
- Yeah?
- And that's where they're getting forced off

49:11.360 --> 49:12.871
by the snow.

49:13.000 --> 49:15.780
And they're catching a bus
up to Reno and on to Truckee,

49:15.880 --> 49:17.869
just, rejoining the trail
at a lower elevation.

49:18.680 --> 49:20.270
I didn't come out here
to ride buses.

49:21.280 --> 49:22.420
You probably didn't
come out here

49:22.520 --> 49:24.460
to slide off the side
of a mountain, either.

49:24.560 --> 49:26.150
True.

49:26.320 --> 49:28.260
If you're worried
about cheating yourself,

49:28.360 --> 49:30.620
just make your hike longer.

49:30.720 --> 49:33.060
You know, just, uh...
walk to Mount Hood

49:33.160 --> 49:35.342
or the Bridge of the Gods.

49:36.240 --> 49:38.260
The Bridge of the Gods?

49:38.360 --> 49:40.462
I like the sound of that.

49:42.360 --> 49:44.861
Either way, don't
beat yourself up.

49:45.040 --> 49:48.861
You, uh... you strike me as someone
who's done plenty of that already.

50:16.240 --> 50:17.580
Can I ride my horse?

50:19.640 --> 50:20.787
Bobbi Grey?

50:23.440 --> 50:24.666
I'm sorry.

50:25.400 --> 50:27.343
- How long?
- Can I ride my horse?

50:27.960 --> 50:29.180
We'll be giving you radiation

50:29.280 --> 50:31.951
to shrink the size of the tumors
along your spine.

50:32.880 --> 50:34.780
The slightest jolt,
it could crumble.

50:34.880 --> 50:36.061
How long?

50:54.520 --> 50:55.781
You all right, honey?

50:59.160 --> 51:00.785
Yeah, I'm fine.

51:16.880 --> 51:18.020
Hi, this is Paul.

51:18.120 --> 51:20.507
Leave a message and I'll call
you back whenever I can.

51:21.360 --> 51:23.303
Hey, sorry to call so late.

51:25.120 --> 51:26.060
Thank you.

51:26.160 --> 51:29.340
I'm in Reno. If you were here,
we could get divorced again.

51:29.440 --> 51:30.580
Um...

51:30.680 --> 51:32.748
Anyway, I... I'm still alive.

51:34.680 --> 51:37.386
And that's all my news.

51:37.840 --> 51:40.830
And the sum total
of what I've learned on my hike.

51:43.840 --> 51:45.305
Okay. Bye.

52:02.360 --> 52:04.781
Hi. I'm Cheryl.

52:05.680 --> 52:07.942
I'm an unaccompanied
female hitchhiker.

52:08.360 --> 52:10.100
Would it be okay if I got into your car.

52:10.200 --> 52:12.780
so that you can rape
and dismember me?

52:16.920 --> 52:18.226
Hey, going north?

52:18.760 --> 52:19.780
Yeah, I am, actually.

52:19.880 --> 52:21.580
Okay, I just need a ride
about 12 miles up.

52:24.320 --> 52:26.980
- Well, that's quite a backpack you got there.
- Thanks.

52:27.080 --> 52:29.023
I can't offer you a ride
because I don't have any room.

52:31.240 --> 52:32.180
What do you mean?

52:32.280 --> 52:33.541
Yeah, I'm packed to the gills.

52:33.960 --> 52:35.186
Jimmy Carter.

52:36.320 --> 52:37.467
No relation.

52:37.920 --> 52:41.706
I interview hobos for the Hobo
Times. Drive all over the USA.

52:41.840 --> 52:45.023
And I have to tell you.
Lady hobos? Hard to find.

52:45.440 --> 52:47.781
I think you're mistaken. I'm not a hobo.

52:48.600 --> 52:51.140
Second of all, that's a real
thing, the Hobo Times?

52:51.240 --> 52:54.100
Yeah, it's real enough to pay
for my rent and gas.

52:54.200 --> 52:56.620
So, how long have you
been out on the road?

52:56.720 --> 53:00.340
I'm not "on the road." I'm
hiking the Pacific Crest Trail.

53:00.440 --> 53:02.020
I just had to bypass
a chunk of it

53:02.120 --> 53:04.348
because there
was a snowfall this year.

53:04.640 --> 53:07.140
Okay, so if you're not
a hobo, where do you live?

53:07.240 --> 53:08.740
I'm between places right now.

53:08.840 --> 53:10.980
I'm probably going to live
in Portland when I get off the PCT.

53:11.080 --> 53:12.830
This is so fucking
cool. I mean...

53:13.240 --> 53:16.660
I've only spoken to maybe one other
female hobo in two years.

53:16.760 --> 53:19.140
Let me reiterate to you,
I am not a hobo.

53:19.240 --> 53:21.420
And that's probably because women
cannot walk out of their lives.

53:21.520 --> 53:23.060
They've got kids
to take care of,

53:23.160 --> 53:25.060
they've got parents
to look after.

53:25.160 --> 53:26.900
You sound like a feminist.

53:27.000 --> 53:28.020
I am.

53:28.120 --> 53:30.951
That's excellent. That's fantastic.
I love feminists.

53:33.040 --> 53:35.020
So you're trying to tell
me you're not a hobo,

53:35.120 --> 53:36.900
so that means you have
a job then, right?

53:37.000 --> 53:39.620
I've had a whole lot
of different jobs.

53:39.720 --> 53:42.391
Up until a couple of years
ago, I was studying.

53:44.520 --> 53:47.140
I hope you don't think
this is too personal,

53:47.240 --> 53:50.140
but I've noticed
it's often personal trauma

53:50.240 --> 53:52.340
that forces people
out of their life

53:52.440 --> 53:56.220
and into the hobo life. Would you
say that's been the case for you?

53:56.320 --> 53:59.629
This is my life. I'm just
taking a little time out.

53:59.840 --> 54:01.226
This is not a hobo life.

54:02.080 --> 54:04.467
I don't know what else
to tell you.

54:05.920 --> 54:07.060
- Can I get a shot?
- No! That...

54:08.720 --> 54:10.780
Yeah, this should be
in the fall issue.

54:10.880 --> 54:13.580
A couple of my pieces have
been in some other magazines.

54:13.680 --> 54:15.220
Harper's has expressed interest.

54:15.320 --> 54:16.260
Harper's?

54:16.360 --> 54:17.620
It's a New York magazine.

54:17.720 --> 54:18.740
Pretty swanky, kind
of a big deal...

54:18.840 --> 54:21.140
Yeah, I know what Harper's is. I want
to write for Harper's one day.

54:21.240 --> 54:24.940
I don't really feel like being
their centerfold Bum of the Month.

54:25.040 --> 54:26.020
What's this?

54:26.120 --> 54:28.587
Hobo care package. Thanks a lot!

54:47.520 --> 54:48.621
Hmm.

54:50.520 --> 54:51.826
What's your dog's name?

54:52.120 --> 54:55.508
Stevie Ray. Got him
the day he died.

54:55.800 --> 54:57.664
The other Stevie Ray, I mean.

54:58.240 --> 55:00.024
I love Stevie Ray.

55:05.640 --> 55:07.424
Hey, put on Love Struck.

55:08.240 --> 55:10.700
Just came to me the second
you got in this car.

55:10.800 --> 55:13.460
Oh, shut up,
Spider! Jesus!

55:13.560 --> 55:16.789
Ignore him. He's nothing
but a horny old bastard.

55:19.120 --> 55:22.303
You must be pretty tough,
hiking this fucking trail.

55:24.080 --> 55:26.660
I'm in a car with you,
taking a ride.

55:27.000 --> 55:28.943
That's not very tough.

55:29.400 --> 55:31.343
That's a cute little boy.
How old is he?

55:35.760 --> 55:37.305
He was eight.

55:40.680 --> 55:42.020
I'm so sorry.

55:42.640 --> 55:45.346
He got hit by a truck when
he was riding his bike.

55:46.120 --> 55:47.221
Five years ago.

55:48.160 --> 55:51.548
He was a tough motherfucker,
too. Just like his mom.

55:54.760 --> 55:56.271
I'm really sorry.

55:57.440 --> 55:59.429
I know you are, sweetheart.

56:01.440 --> 56:02.820
I was never me.

56:02.920 --> 56:05.740
Don't. Okay? Don't.
It's not over.

56:05.840 --> 56:08.860
We're gonna find somebody who can
help you and we are gonna fight this!

56:08.960 --> 56:10.585
I was always...

56:11.600 --> 56:13.748
A mother or a wife.

56:19.640 --> 56:23.028
I was never even in the driver's seat
of my own life.

56:23.920 --> 56:27.786
I thought there was so
much time, you know?

56:31.640 --> 56:33.310
And just when...

56:35.200 --> 56:37.382
So many things were beginning.

56:41.960 --> 56:43.107
Oh, well!

57:00.320 --> 57:02.309
You've got to be kidding me.

57:06.680 --> 57:07.781
Hang on.

57:19.760 --> 57:21.225
All right.

57:33.280 --> 57:35.860
I surely would...

57:36.640 --> 57:37.980
Can you stop
humming that song?

57:39.320 --> 57:40.380
Happy people sing!

57:40.480 --> 57:42.184
Shut up.

57:52.400 --> 57:55.380
I'm sitting
in the railway station.

57:55.480 --> 57:58.789
Got a ticket for my destination.

58:04.000 --> 58:06.020
The sun is right
behind my back.

58:06.120 --> 58:08.621
So true north should
be over there

58:08.960 --> 58:11.300
I will not lose
this fucking track.

58:11.400 --> 58:14.151
Or I'll end up in Delaware

58:14.800 --> 58:16.902
Portland bound

58:17.400 --> 58:20.980
I hope I am Portland bound

58:23.800 --> 58:24.901
Hey!

58:26.320 --> 58:27.421
Hey!

58:29.720 --> 58:31.185
Where am I?

58:32.400 --> 58:34.025
California!

58:35.280 --> 58:37.020
Fucking hilarious.

58:37.120 --> 58:38.824
Plumas County!

58:39.280 --> 58:40.984
Are you lost?

58:42.560 --> 58:43.821
No!

58:46.280 --> 58:47.745
Just screwed.

59:03.120 --> 59:04.745
Hey, beauty.

59:05.640 --> 59:07.390
Hey, my Lady.

59:07.720 --> 59:09.106
She saved my life.

59:09.280 --> 59:11.140
You know, after I left your dad.

59:11.240 --> 59:12.341
I know.

59:13.520 --> 59:16.464
I'm not going to make
you promise anything.

59:17.480 --> 59:20.060
This is hard
enough on you as it is.

59:23.640 --> 59:26.061
Just please try and do
the kindest thing.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.431
Come back!

01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:36.026
Come back.

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:41.106
Come back!

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:45.745
Here you go. This
should keep you warm.

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:52.142
I'll be back
in the morning with Leif.

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:01.111
I love you.

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:05.824
You're the center of me.

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:08.704
Everything I am.

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:12.711
Love.

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:16.185
Love.

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:24.981
How's she doing?

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:27.947
The doctor said it
would be a year.

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:31.304
It's been a month.
One fucking month!

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:34.671
I'm sorry.

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:39.224
I'll pray for her.

01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:57.311
Fucking Saint Patrick.

01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:00.463
Go to hell, all you saints.

01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:07.747
Thank you, God,
for showing me the way.

01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:10.669
As if He gives a shit.

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:13.384
I'm sorry, but God
is a ruthless bitch.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.060
Yeah, well, I really need him.

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:20.581
It's urgent. Tell him
to get the fuck home.

01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:45.503
Where the fuck have you been?

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:48.420
I've been at the hospital
all day! She's dying.

01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:50.304
- Don't say that!
- You understand that?

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:53.100
- She can't die.
- She can. She is dying.

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:54.301
Stop it!

01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:57.429
She can't die.

01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:08.064
There was Killer,
and Doobie.

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:10.224
Doo-bie!

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:13.949
And Motorcycle Dan.

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:16.981
Motorcycle Dan... wow!

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:20.142
I wanted to be like that guy.

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:25.870
And Nipper.

01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:31.620
"If you press your face
against the glass..."

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:34.187
"you can see a little slice
of Lake Superior."

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:35.946
A room with a view.

01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:37.740
She said.

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:40.625
All my life, I've always
wanted a room with a view.

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:44.186
Jesus,
she just never stops.

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:50.987
The past few years, I've acted
like she was nothing to me.

01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:53.826
But...

01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:57.502
really, she was everything.

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:10.465
What are you doing?

01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:12.620
Praying.

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:16.585
Shut up.

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:20.631
I'm praying to the whole
fucking universe...

01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:25.182
hoping there's a God.

01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:29.630
Because I want a miracle.
I want a fucking miracle!

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:33.310
Our mother isn't
going to die at 45.

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:41.751
Are you burning and yearning?

01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:46.705
Do you ever feel blue?

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:50.427
And do you think of returning?

01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:53.942
How's the world treating you?

01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:57.021
I can't wait to see her face.

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:00.902
She'll be so happy to see you.

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:08.143
So happy to see you...

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.261
How much do I love you?

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:19.300
No.

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:20.501
This much?

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:22.750
This much?

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:24.181
This much?

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:25.581
This much?

01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:27.820
I'm stuck! I can't go wider.

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:29.351
I can't go wider!

01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:34.621
How's the world treating you?

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:41.789
We put ice on her eyes.

01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:43.426
What?

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.262
She wanted to donate
her corneas, so...

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:48.031
Oh, my God.

01:05:57.360 --> 01:05:59.224
Fuck you, bitch!

01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:14.269
What the fuck do you want?

01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:49.700
Fuck you, let's go.

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:52.346
I'd rather be a sparrow

01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:54.310
than a snail.

01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:57.182
Yes, I would.

01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:00.621
If I could

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:03.507
I surely would

01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:12.745
I'd rather be
a hammer than a nail.

01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:15.582
Yes, I would

01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:22.981
Ow.

01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:06.029
I'd rather be a forest
than a street.

01:09:07.399 --> 01:09:09.502
If I could.

01:09:10.399 --> 01:09:13.344
If I only could

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:15.350
I surely would

01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:18.151
I surely would

01:09:35.439 --> 01:09:36.380
Fuck it.

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:19.385
Can you stop
humming that song?

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:24.020
What is wrong with you?

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:26.260
I don't know.
What's wrong with you?

01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:28.100
I'm happy. Happy people sing!

01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:32.430
Why are you happy? We have
nothing, Mom. Nothing.

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:34.580
We're rich in love.

01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:35.980
Oh, my God, please.

01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:37.944
Don't even start with that.

01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:40.060
We're both waitressing
full-time.

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:41.380
We're students.

01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:43.540
We'll have loans the rest
of our lives. This house...

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:46.340
is falling apart.
You're all by yourself

01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:49.862
because you married
some abusive alcoholic asshole.

01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:52.180
And I come home
and you're singing?

01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:53.950
What part of it do you not get?

01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:56.951
There's nothing I don't
get, believe me.

01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:00.785
But then what?

01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:04.580
Cheryl, if there's one thing
I could teach you...

01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:06.740
It's how to find your best self.

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:09.740
And when you do, how to hold
onto it for dear life.

01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:12.068
And this is your best self.

01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:13.786
I'm trying.

01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:20.023
Do I regret marrying
an abusive alcoholic asshole?

01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:24.461
No.

01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:27.826
Not for a second.
Because I got you.

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:30.070
And your brother.

01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:31.621
See how it works?

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:33.744
It isn't easy...

01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:35.780
But it's worth it.

01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:38.627
There's going to be a lot
worse days than this.

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:41.541
And you can let them kill you...

01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:45.747
But, I don't know...
I want to live.

01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:48.820
"I want to live."

01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:52.901
You couldn't even stick
around and enjoy your miserable happy life.

01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:01.427
I think you have packages for me?
My name is Cheryl Strayed.

01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:03.380
New boots from REI?

01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:04.580
Yes.

01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:06.191
How far did you walk in those?

01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:10.507
About 50 miles. You sure
there's not another package?

01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:13.540
I'm sure. And, lady,
if you walked 50 miles

01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:16.186
in duct tape, you got
the right package.

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:18.824
It's two bucks for the Snapple.

01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:21.020
I'll pass.

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:23.351
Thanks.

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:35.271
You like my shoes?

01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:40.660
Dearest Cheryl,
you made it halfway.

01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:43.147
Six-hundred miles. Damn!

01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:47.380
I ran into Aimee. She said you
were making your hike longer.

01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:49.500
Did you decide where
you'll finish?

01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:52.544
Let me know, I'll send
a tube of foot cream.

01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:56.260
I'm sorry if I cut you short
on the phone before you left.

01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:58.588
I still resent you, I guess.

01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:00.980
The funny thing is...

01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:02.670
hell, I'll admit it...

01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:05.020
I miss you.

01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:08.220
Be sure to take plenty of water
with you for the trail.

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:10.380
There's a water tank
20 miles up, right?

01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:13.584
Yep. But it's way over 100
degrees out there.

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:15.345
That's a lot of sweat.

01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:17.270
Okay. Thanks.

01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:20.580
Howdy.

01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:23.511
You should have something
for Stacey Johnson.

01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:25.625
I'll go check.

01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:28.788
Hey, are you hiking the PCT?

01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:30.546
Yeah.

01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:31.781
Are you?

01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:34.351
You're a woman!

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:41.301
You come across a guy
named Greg?

01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:45.220
Yeah. A while ago,
at Kennedy Meadows...

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:47.787
when I knew even less
than I do now.

01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:49.500
Well, he quit.

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:51.589
What? Greg?

01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:55.070
He couldn't deal with the snow.
He's coming back next year.

01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:56.461
Wow.

01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:58.860
Greg quit and I'm still here?

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:04.185
Cheers to that.

01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:12.190
You get lonely?

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:19.306
Honestly, I think I'm lonelier
in my real life than out here.

01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:23.549
Yes, I miss my friends,
of course, but...

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:28.029
it's not like anybody's waiting
for me at home.

01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:30.741
How about you? Why are you here?

01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:40.304
I don't know. I just need to find
something in myself, you know?

01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:43.306
I think the trail
is good for that.

01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:45.021
I mean, look.

01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:49.742
This has the power to fill
you up again if you let it.

01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:54.020
My mother used to say
something that drove me nuts.

01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:57.180
"There's a sunrise
and a sunset every day..."

01:14:57.280 --> 01:15:00.190
"and you can choose
to be there for it."

01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:03.307
"You can put yourself
in the way of beauty."

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:07.031
My kind of woman.

01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:18.020
She was the love of my life.
There's nothing else...

01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:19.426
to say.

01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:24.665
I thought there'd be couches
and Kleenex and shit.

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:26.704
That's 50-bucks-an-hour therapy.

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:29.747
This is 10-bucks-an-hour
therapy.

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:33.340
Why were you destroyed
by your mother's death?

01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:37.540
Is that your job? To tell the bereaved
they're grieving too much?

01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:42.020
People grieve in all sorts of different
ways. I'm asking about yours.

01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:43.380
Is mine so bad?

01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:47.020
You're using heroin and having
sex with anyone who asks.

01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:50.303
I'm not sure these things
are making you happy.

01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:51.500
That's where you're wrong.

01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:54.590
When I'm doing them,
I feel good and happy.

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:57.020
When I'm not, I feel
like I want to die.

01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:59.340
You sleep
with your husband, too?

01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:03.340
No, I'm sort of like a guy
about sex. I prefer to be detached.

01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:06.506
You think that's what guys
are like?

01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:12.110
"You are here"?

01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:15.982
I see that poster everywhere,
and I fucking hate it.

01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:18.991
Why would you ever teach
a child they don't matter?

01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:21.900
Did you feel you mattered?

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.750
I know I mattered.

01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:28.380
So who detached from you?

01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:32.869
Right. You know what?

01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:37.024
This is not going to work.
This is not about talking.

01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:54.989
"You want a knuckle sandwich?"

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:00.623
You want a knuckle sandwich?

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:02.825
You want a knuckle sandwich?

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:07.141
Go, go, go! Go get in the car.

01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:09.060
Get in the car.

01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:10.750
Get the fuck out of here!

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:12.301
Fucking whore!

01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:14.662
I'm going to kill you!

01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:19.740
I'll kick your ass with my new
boots, you fucking asshole.

01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:21.351
Thank you, baby.

01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:44.020
"Eggs and bacon."

01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:46.348
You want some eggs and bacon?

01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:49.541
Baby?

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:03.660
No more
rain, no more pain.

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:10.140
"Even a child with normal feet
was in love with the world..."

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:13.230
"after he had got
a new pair of shoes."

01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:15.669
Flannery O'Connor.

01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:19.070
And Cheryl Strayed.

01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:48.746
The ashes of a body aren't
really like ashes from a fire.

01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:51.586
Soft and silky,
they're more like...

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.946
pale pebbles mixed
with a gritty gray gravel.

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:01.585
I spread most of them
around her grave.

01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:05.104
But some of the larger chunks...

01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:07.505
I put in my mouth...

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:09.785
and I swallowed whole.

01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:14.020
Then I moved to Portland...

01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:17.350
with crazy Joe.

01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:20.948
The first time
I smoked heroin...

01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:22.671
I laughed like a child...

01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:26.504
and twirled
around in my mother's jewelry box.

01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:31.540
Then we snorted it.

01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:33.788
But we were never
going to shoot it.

01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:35.581
Never.

01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:41.100
The first time
I shot up, I begged.

01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:43.220
More, more, more!

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:46.071
How do you like it,
how do you like it?

01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:56.142
The day after my birthday...

01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:58.780
a man asked me for money.

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:01.631
That's what I want.

01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:20.183
A week after that...

01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:24.384
somebody finally wished
me happy birthday.

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:32.980
Heroin? Of all the stupid,
selfish things!

01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:35.342
Why are you doing
this to yourself?

01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:36.980
Don't you fucking touch me!

01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:38.420
Don't play this game!

01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:41.180
Why did you even come?
I didn't ask you to!

01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:42.660
You just want to be the hero!

01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:44.191
Yeah, maybe!

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.340
Why did you come here?

01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:50.871
Because!

01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:55.431
Just because.

01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:13.311
Fuck it.

01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:27.389
Where is this fucking tank?

01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:46.427
No.

01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:48.741
No!

01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:03.781
Shit.

01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:22.703
Don't fucking die here.

01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:07.511
Thirty minutes.

01:24:07.680 --> 01:24:09.782
Fucking iodine pills.

01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:50.705
You got any water?

01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:56.784
I'd give you some of mine,
but it's not ready.

01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:00.064
It takes about half an hour...
with an iodine pill.

01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:02.702
But you have to filter it first.

01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:04.865
We don't have a filter.

01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:07.905
You can use mine.

01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:10.025
Do you have a bottle?

01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:12.543
Got an empty beer can.

01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:14.186
Okay.

01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:25.749
What are you doing out here?

01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:27.750
Hiking the PCT.

01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:36.110
So how can we kill the time?

01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:39.031
I can think of some ways.

01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:42.661
She's got a real nice
figure, doesn't she?

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:46.860
I have to get going.

01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:49.825
Sit down. We're just
messing with your head.

01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:00.424
We need to get going, too.

01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:07.460
Thank you much.

01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:08.707
Yeah.

01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:15.666
Thought you were heading out.

01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:20.144
I changed my mind.

01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:23.029
Tried to trick us?

01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:26.508
No, I changed my mind.

01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:29.824
Changed your clothes, too.

01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:32.265
I like your pants.

01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:34.785
They look good on you.

01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:38.942
Show off your hips and legs
and tight little ass.

01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:42.180
Please don't say that.

01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:45.190
Can't a guy give a girl
a compliment anymore?

01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:49.711
Thank you.

01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:57.780
What the hell
are you doing?

01:27:57.880 --> 01:28:01.746
I thought you were lost. Get
your ass over here, let's go!

01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:08.305
Here's to a young girl
alone in the woods.

01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:16.110
Hello, Oregon cow.

01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:34.584
Look out of any window.

01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:38.980
Any morning, any evening.

01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:41.387
Any day.

01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:46.582
Maybe the sun is shining.

01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:48.743
Birds are winging.

01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:52.462
Rain is falling
from a heavy sky.

01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:57.911
What do you want me to do.

01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:02.705
To do for you to see
you through...

01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:38.460
That shade looks nice on you.

01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:39.946
Oh, you think?

01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:41.860
Oh, my.

01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:45.940
Do you mind if I say something?

01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:47.187
Sure.

01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:50.100
The nicest lipstick
in the world can't help a girl

01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:53.304
if she doesn't take care
of her personal hygiene.

01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:57.469
I've every intention
of taking care of that.

01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:01.305
It really needs to be
a priority, sweetie.

01:31:18.920 --> 01:31:20.146
Hey.

01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:23.301
Hey.

01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:28.343
I, uh... I work at a music
club down the street.

01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:30.863
We're honoring Jerry
Garcia tonight.

01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:33.828
- You should come along.
- Oh. Cool.

01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:36.746
What's your name?

01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:38.346
Cheryl.

01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:42.620
Don't worry, I don't bite.

01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:44.549
I don't mind biting.

01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:48.580
Oh, my God. I can't
believe I just said that.

01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:51.780
I'm so sorry.
I've been on my own for a little while.

01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:54.420
Not that I'm "on my own."
I've been in a lot of relationships before.

01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:57.146
I've just been hiking
on my own for a while.

01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:01.549
Look, I'm gonna put your name
on the guest list.

01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:04.223
Hope to see you later.

01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:11.511
Hi, honey.

01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:14.222
Here is your Ashland box.

01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:19.704
Enjoy some well-deserved rest,
but don't overdo it, okay?

01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:22.668
Still a lot to hike, no?

01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:26.263
I had said you can quit anytime.

01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:29.580
But I take it back.

01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:32.545
Call me when you get
to the finish line.

01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:35.100
Love and kisses, Aimee.

01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:37.540
As it were your own.

01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:39.947
It's a hand-me-down.

01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:44.540
The thoughts are broken.

01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:49.423
Perhaps they're better.

01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:53.551
Left unsung

01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:03.104
I don't know

01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:06.660
I don't really care.

01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:08.100
Do I know you?

01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:10.060
Thanks.

01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:13.230
Let there be song.

01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:16.582
To fill the air.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:23.231
Ripple in still water.

01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:28.626
When there is no pebble tossed.

01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:32.303
Nor wind to blow

01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:04.186
Dear Paul,

01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:08.183
I woke up this morning and wrote
your name in the sand.

01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:12.786
I've done that on every beach
I've been on ever since I met you.

01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:15.701
But I'm not going
to do it again.

01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:18.309
I'm ready to move on.

01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:22.022
Baby, baby, be my friend

01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:26.511
I have only another 300
miles left to walk.

01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:30.343
I'm desperate for it to be over.

01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:35.263
But I'm terrified, too.

01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:38.504
When I'm done...

01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:41.141
I'll only have
two dimes to my name.

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:44.661
But I'll have to start living.

01:35:47.440 --> 01:35:49.588
And I'm nowhere near ready.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.784
Please! Sir, wait!

01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:11.270
I just closed.

01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:21.100
I think you have a package
for me in there?

01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:22.940
Could it wait until tomorrow?

01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:26.383
It has fresh clothes and food,
and batteries I need.

01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:30.860
Okay.

01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:33.863
If you'll have a drink
with me later.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:37.101
Sure.

01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:44.465
There you go, good-looking.

01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:46.626
Thanks.

01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:49.140
- You like punch?
- Hmm?

01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:52.460
I make a good one. I throw
every liquor I can find into a bucket

01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:54.947
and I pour a couple
of cans of juice on top.

01:36:55.240 --> 01:36:56.751
Sounds good.

01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:03.540
- Cheryl?
- Yeah.

01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:04.980
- Oh, my God.
- We're closed, guys.

01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:06.980
- "If your nerve deny you...
- "...go above your nerve."

01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:08.980
- Emily Dickinson.
- Yes.

01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:12.460
"I have promises to keep
and miles to go before I sleep."

01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:13.620
Walt Whitman?

01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:15.300
No, that was Robert Frost.

01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:17.300
The Whitman was, "Be
curious, not judgmental."

01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:18.620
Yes.

01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:21.140
"God is a ruthless bitch."
You left the name off.

01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:23.060
- That one was me.
- You're our hero.

01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:25.100
Okay, fellas, I'm
shutting up now.

01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:26.980
We just wanted
to pick up our post?

01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:29.380
No. I'm sorry. I already reopened
for the young lady here.

01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:30.580
And I'm not gonna reopen again.

01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:33.186
But you wouldn't really have to reopen
because you haven't closed yet.

01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:35.140
And their packages
are right there.

01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:36.580
It's such a miserable night.

01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:39.300
Whatever's in them is gonna make
the night just that much better.

01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:40.831
Do you mind?

01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:48.340
That your horse?

01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:50.985
If you want to take her
out in the morning, she could do with it.

01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:54.660
Hey, so the campsite,
is it left? Left, right?

01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:56.066
Yeah.

01:37:56.960 --> 01:37:58.940
Good night! I'll see
you in the morning.

01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:00.187
Oh.

01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:05.860
Number one and number two.

01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:09.820
Just a little.
Just a little.

01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:14.461
Wonderful!

01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:18.260
So, Cheryl, how do you deal
with being on your own all the time?

01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:21.380
I mean, we're with each other
and we're still sick of ourselves.

01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:22.460
Mmm-hmm.

01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:24.901
No. I've been to most of the places
in my head that

01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:28.620
I didn't want to go to,
but I feel like there's

01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:32.860
one or two that, for whatever
reason, I just...

01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:34.425
I hear you.

01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:39.069
There's a few girlfriends that I'm
in no hurry to think about again.

01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:44.900
I think I know exactly
who you're talking about. Right?

01:38:46.160 --> 01:38:48.540
I don't want to talk
about this right now.

01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:54.150
Not again! Good night!

01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:15.108
Just please try to do the kindest thing.

01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:30.982
We don't have to do this.

01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:39.629
She's been really
sick for a long time.

01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:43.347
There has
to be another way.

01:39:44.400 --> 01:39:46.700
We don't have
the money to do it right.

01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:48.504
We can't go to a vet.

01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:55.546
Leif, she's just going
to die slowly and painfully.

01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:03.181
Just please do
the kindest thing.

01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:08.064
Hey, brother, it's me.

01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:10.781
Look, I know we don't have
a home to go back to, but...

01:41:11.080 --> 01:41:14.229
I want you to know I'm
pulling you along with me.

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.262
It's been really hard, but

01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:19.704
do me a favor, okay?

01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:21.985
Walk a little?

01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:27.591
I love you.

01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:29.947
Bye.

01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:33.981
Hey, good-looking.

01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:37.580
I brought you coffee
and a donut, fresh this morning.

01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:39.191
Thanks. Really.

01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:43.420
Why don't you come by for a refill
before you head off?

01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:45.145
I will. Thanks.

01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:47.107
Good morning, fellas.

01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:49.944
- Morning.
- Morning.

01:41:55.080 --> 01:41:57.182
So, you got a trail name?

01:41:57.600 --> 01:41:59.180
- Hmm?
- You know, like a nickname.

01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:01.189
We've got one for you.

01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:03.543
- Really.
- Queen of the PCT.

01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:05.340
Come on.

01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:07.100
You've just got so many stories

01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:09.740
about people doing things for you
and wanting to help you out.

01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:12.060
I mean, nobody ever
gives us anything.

01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:14.100
No one ever does anything
for us, in fact.

01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:17.700
But please, please, come and get
your refill, Your Majesty.

01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:20.100
Yeah, Your Majesty doesn't
really go for refills.

01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:21.860
Refills typically come to her.

01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:22.940
Exactly.

01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:31.665
Dude, stop.

01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:35.180
Stop. Now I'm going to have
that song stuck in my head

01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:37.189
for the next hundred fucking
miles.

01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:39.789
- Would you prefer I just...
- Don't.

01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:42.141
Don't.

01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:50.500
And I said hey, hey, hey...

01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:51.906
Shut up, man.

01:42:53.880 --> 01:42:55.948
Shut up! I'm serious.

01:42:57.960 --> 01:42:59.710
I said, hey!

01:43:00.040 --> 01:43:01.620
What's going on?

01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:02.900
Get him. Get him!

01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:08.620
I'll get you soaked!

01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:11.027
I said hey, what's going on?

01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:16.702
I'd rather be
a forest than a street

01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:42.745
It's okay.

01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:44.705
You're safe.

01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:48.071
It's okay.

01:43:56.760 --> 01:43:58.464
You're all right.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:00.540
Don't be scared.

01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:03.584
You got him! Thanks!

01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:12.905
Thanks.

01:44:13.800 --> 01:44:14.780
Does he have a name?

01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:16.220
Shooting Star.

01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:17.420
Shooting Star?

01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:19.702
And I'm Vera, and this is Kyle.

01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:24.140
I'm Cheryl. Are you
enjoying your hike today?

01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:27.460
I'm having a wonderful time,
thank you very much for asking.

01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:29.260
You're so polite.

01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:31.980
We're just out for the weekend,
rain or no.

01:44:32.080 --> 01:44:33.100
Yeah.

01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:34.220
Vera's my grandmom.

01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:36.580
She's looking after me
because I have some problems

01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:38.942
I'm not supposed to talk
about with strangers.

01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:46.591
Well, you don't have
to talk about them.

01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:50.661
But, you know, everybody has
problems. I have problems, too.

01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:52.789
What kinds of problems?

01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:56.826
Well, I mean, I have
problems with my dad.

01:44:57.280 --> 01:44:58.860
I don't see him anymore.

01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:01.825
Me, neither. What
about your mommy?

01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:05.786
She died.

01:45:09.880 --> 01:45:12.824
But, you know, problems
don't stay problems.

01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:15.023
They turn into something else.

01:45:16.240 --> 01:45:17.830
How did she die?

01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:20.345
Um...

01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:22.629
She got very sick.

01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:26.663
My mother's a singer.
She's taught me many songs.

01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:28.380
Oh, really?

01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:30.660
Would you like to hear one?

01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:31.941
Yeah.

01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:36.584
From this valley they say you are leaving.

01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:41.265
We shall miss your bright
eyes and sweet smile.

01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:46.349
For you take with you
all of the sunshine.

01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:50.830
That has brightened
our pathway a while.

01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:55.305
Then come and sit
by my side if you love me.

01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:59.382
Do not hasten to bid me adieu.

01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:03.985
Just remember the Red
River Valley.

01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:08.231
And the cowboy
that loved you so true.

01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:13.064
Just remember the Red
River Valley.

01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:17.385
And the cowboy
that loved you so true.

01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:20.866
That was really beautiful.

01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:23.911
Thank you.

01:46:58.160 --> 01:46:59.591
I miss you.

01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:05.590
God, I miss you.

01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:27.671
There's no way to know what makes
one thing happen and not another.

01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:31.429
What leads to what.

01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:34.629
What destroys what.

01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:38.422
What causes what to flourish.

01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:40.346
Or die.

01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:43.063
Or take another course.

01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:48.822
What if I forgive myself?

01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:52.949
What if I was sorry?

01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:56.940
But if I could go back in time,

01:47:57.040 --> 01:47:59.347
I wouldn't do a single
thing differently.

01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:06.029
What if I wanted to sleep
with every single one of those men?

01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:09.863
What if heroin
taught me something?

01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:18.348
What if all those things I did
were the things that got me here?

01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:24.506
What if I was never redeemed?

01:48:27.040 --> 01:48:29.268
What if I already was?

01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:50.743
It took me years to be
the woman my mother raised.

01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:56.261
It took me four years, seven months
and three days to do it.

01:48:57.360 --> 01:48:59.064
Without her.

01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:04.749
After I lost myself
in the wilderness of my grief,

01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:08.382
I found my way out of the woods.

01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:17.940
And I didn't even know
where I was going

01:49:18.040 --> 01:49:20.791
until I got there
on the last day of my hike.

01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:26.507
Thank you, I thought
over and over again,

01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:28.824
for everything the trail
had taught me,

01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:31.660
and everything
I couldn't yet know.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.467
How, in four years,
I'd cross this very bridge.

01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:43.505
I'd marry a man in a spot almost
visible from where I was standing.

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:46.860
How, in nine years,
that man and I

01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:49.060
would have a son named Carver,

01:49:49.160 --> 01:49:53.424
and a year later, a daughter
named after my mother, Bobbi.

01:49:56.840 --> 01:49:58.100
I knew only that I didn't
need to

01:49:58.200 --> 01:50:00.620
reach with my bare
hands anymore.

01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:04.541
That seeing the fish beneath the surface
of the water was enough.

01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:07.267
That it was everything.

01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:11.470
My life, like all lives,

01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:16.143
mysterious, irrevocable
and sacred.

01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:19.145
So very close.

01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:22.864
So very present.

01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:27.428
So very belonging to me.

01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:32.664
How wild it was... to let it be.

01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:38.667
I'd rather be a sparrow than a snail.

01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:42.021
Yes, I would.

01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:45.341
If I could

01:50:45.640 --> 01:50:48.823
I surely would

01:50:53.200 --> 01:50:58.750
I'd rather be
a hammer than a nail.

01:50:59.080 --> 01:51:01.421
Yes, I would.

01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:04.546
If I only could

01:51:05.040 --> 01:51:07.825
I surely would.

01:51:12.600 --> 01:51:17.627
Away, I'd rather sail away.

01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:21.220
Like a swan.

01:51:21.320 --> 01:51:24.822
That's here and gone.

01:51:25.520 --> 01:51:30.501
A man gets tied
up to the ground.

01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:34.260
He gives the world.

01:51:34.360 --> 01:51:40.183
Its saddest sound

01:51:48.120 --> 01:51:52.589
I'd rather be a forest
than a street.

01:51:54.280 --> 01:51:56.860
Yes, I would.

01:51:57.560 --> 01:52:00.420
If I could

01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:03.351
I surely would

01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:08.790
I'd rather feel the earth
beneath my feet.

01:52:10.440 --> 01:52:13.260
Yes, I would.

01:52:13.360 --> 01:52:16.580
If I only could

01:52:16.680 --> 01:52:19.704
I surely would

01:53:06.520 --> 01:53:08.500
As the sun comes up.

01:53:08.600 --> 01:53:10.660
As the moon goes down.

01:53:10.760 --> 01:53:15.060
These heavy notions
creep around.

01:53:15.160 --> 01:53:18.104
It makes me think.

01:53:19.040 --> 01:53:20.904
Long ago

01:53:23.440 --> 01:53:26.100
I was brought into this life.

01:53:26.200 --> 01:53:31.306
A little lamb, a little lamb.

01:53:31.560 --> 01:53:34.903
Courageous, stumbling.

01:53:35.440 --> 01:53:39.306
Fearless was my middle name.

01:53:39.520 --> 01:53:44.340
But somewhere there
I lost my way.

01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:48.460
Everyone walks the same.

01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:52.824
Expecting me to step.

01:53:52.960 --> 01:53:57.300
The narrow path they've laid.

01:53:57.400 --> 01:54:02.100
They claim to walk unafraid

01:54:02.200 --> 01:54:06.420
I'll be clumsy instead.

01:54:06.520 --> 01:54:12.024
Hold me, love me or leave me.

01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:15.669
High.

01:54:16.280 --> 01:54:20.590
Say keep within the boundaries.

01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:24.270
If you want to play.

01:54:25.120 --> 01:54:31.227
Say contradiction
only makes it harder.

01:54:33.640 --> 01:54:36.584
How can I be.

01:54:38.680 --> 01:54:41.829
What I want to be?

01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:48.980
When all I want to do
is strip away.

01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:51.220
These stilled constraints.

01:54:51.320 --> 01:54:54.740
And crush this charade.

01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:59.100
Shred this sad masquerade

01:54:59.200 --> 01:55:04.260
I don't need no persuading

01:55:04.360 --> 01:55:08.900
I'll trip, fall,
pick myself up and.

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:12.220
Walk unafraid

01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:16.106
I'll be clumsy instead.

01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:21.990
Hold me, love me or leave me.

01:55:22.200 --> 01:55:25.668
High
