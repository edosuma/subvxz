00:37.562 --> 00:38.995
Sorry!

01:44.529 --> 01:46.497
Hey, wait for me!

01:46.731 --> 01:48.790
Hold the boat!

01:49.867 --> 01:51.357
I'm coming!

01:52.337 --> 01:55.636
Noah! Mr. The Ark! I'm here.

01:56.174 --> 01:59.268
Barely made it. I thought
you were leaving without...

02:01.879 --> 02:04.780
Gee, Mr. Noah, sir...

02:06.050 --> 02:07.711
...l'm gonna come too.

02:08.820 --> 02:10.981
What are you, anyway?

02:11.322 --> 02:12.516
Good question.

02:12.724 --> 02:14.282
Now technically speaking...

02:14.792 --> 02:17.386
...let's say, put me down
as a whatever.

02:17.595 --> 02:20.826
What do you mean? What is your species?

02:23.635 --> 02:26.934
I don't know.
I guess there's only one of me.

02:29.874 --> 02:31.933
Then you are doomed!

02:34.946 --> 02:36.072
Wait. Wait!

02:43.187 --> 02:44.449
Yes, sir?

02:44.656 --> 02:46.351
You may need this.

02:49.827 --> 02:51.454
But, but...

03:07.245 --> 03:09.770
I don't want to be alone!

03:16.688 --> 03:18.952
No, I don't want to be alone.

03:21.859 --> 03:24.555
I don't wanna be alone!

03:24.762 --> 03:26.593
You're not alone.

03:26.931 --> 03:27.829
Who said that?

03:28.032 --> 03:32.469
Gee, I don't know. Maybe it's the rat
who's hanging out of the window!

03:35.873 --> 03:36.703
Rizzo?

03:36.908 --> 03:39.877
No, it's Santa,
but I forgot my reindeer.

03:40.078 --> 03:42.546
- I'm sorry, Rizzo.
- Yeah, right.

03:44.248 --> 03:45.340
Boy.

03:45.550 --> 03:47.177
I had that weird dream again.

03:47.385 --> 03:51.481
The one with the goat and the dwarf
and the jar of peanut butter?

03:52.256 --> 03:55.657
It was the one where...
Forget it. You wouldn't understand.

03:55.860 --> 03:58.488
I'd understand.
Come on, we're roommates.

04:00.531 --> 04:02.863
I'm here for you, man.

04:03.201 --> 04:06.568
Okay. It's the one where
I'm talking to this Noah guy...

04:06.771 --> 04:10.070
...and he won't let me on his boat
because I'm all...

04:15.913 --> 04:16.845
...alone.

04:18.750 --> 04:20.274
Good night, Rizzo.

04:55.052 --> 04:57.043
Morning.

05:17.275 --> 05:19.266
What? Hey, man!

06:21.706 --> 06:25.164
I do it all for you, ladies.

06:48.866 --> 06:49.924
And scrunch.

06:50.134 --> 06:52.898
Scrunch it. And right. And left.

06:53.104 --> 06:55.800
And suck in those tummies, ladies.

07:10.087 --> 07:12.749
Great. Way to get down
with your bad selves.

07:13.357 --> 07:15.552
- Pass the bagel.
- Good morning, Rowlf.

07:15.760 --> 07:17.728
Good morning, Bob.

07:18.696 --> 07:20.823
- Good morning, everyone.
- Morning.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.890
Hello, little people.

07:24.101 --> 07:27.070
What an absolutely splendid day!

07:29.473 --> 07:30.838
How are you, Piggy?

07:31.042 --> 07:34.307
Late. I start my fabulous
new job today.

07:34.512 --> 07:37.675
We megastar TVjournalists
have to be punctual, you know.

07:37.882 --> 07:40.282
- TVjournalist?
- Gotta run. Bye, Kermie.

07:40.484 --> 07:41.917
Kissie, kissie.

07:45.389 --> 07:47.721
- Is breakfast over?
- No, why?

07:47.925 --> 07:50.416
Because I think the bacon just ran out.

07:53.631 --> 07:57.226
The raspberry flapovers
will be out in a moment.

07:57.435 --> 08:00.768
Uncle Kermit, what will you do
now that you're on vacation?

08:00.972 --> 08:03.634
Robin, once I get
those housepainters started...

08:03.841 --> 08:06.139
...l'm gonna kick back and relax.

08:06.410 --> 08:09.208
- When will you fix the oven, okay?
- What's wrong with it?

08:12.516 --> 08:13.608
That.

08:13.951 --> 08:16.818
Yurski burski popovers kaboofed.

08:17.054 --> 08:20.023
I'll put it on the top of my list.

08:20.558 --> 08:22.355
There is a menu correction, okay.

08:22.560 --> 08:25.688
We will now be serving
bologna sandwiches.

08:27.732 --> 08:28.790
But no bread.

08:30.401 --> 08:31.231
I'm gone.

08:36.240 --> 08:40.039
Hey, Gonzo, aren't you performing
at that bar mitzvah today?

08:40.443 --> 08:42.469
Electric Mayhem's covering for me.

08:43.214 --> 08:44.272
Shalom.

08:47.885 --> 08:48.783
Oy!

08:49.787 --> 08:54.224
But you never miss the chance to get
shot out of a cannon. Something wrong?

08:56.360 --> 09:00.626
It's just that I'm sick and tired of
being a one-of-a-kind freak, that's all.

09:01.632 --> 09:05.090
Gonzo, you are not
a one-of-a-kind freak. You're a...

09:07.338 --> 09:08.168
A whatever?

09:09.740 --> 09:10.672
- Yeah.
- You see?

09:10.875 --> 09:14.811
See what I mean? I don't even know
where I came from orwho I am.

09:15.212 --> 09:16.042
Yo, Kerm.

09:17.014 --> 09:19.039
Were you waiting for some painters?

09:20.217 --> 09:21.980
- They're driving away.
- What?

09:22.186 --> 09:23.653
Animal bit one of them.

09:26.190 --> 09:27.020
Wait, guys!

09:27.224 --> 09:29.124
Don't let them go!

09:31.796 --> 09:33.058
You know what you are?

09:35.132 --> 09:36.622
Distinct.

09:37.168 --> 09:40.660
Hey, wait, guys! He didn't mean it!
He's just a musician!

10:08.065 --> 10:09.623
Distinct, huh?

10:10.134 --> 10:12.159
More like extinct.

10:29.453 --> 10:31.421
"Watch the sky"?

10:33.824 --> 10:37.692
Rizzo, come here. I think my
Kap'n Alphabet is sending me a message.

10:37.895 --> 10:41.729
I had some guacamole last night,
and it's still speaking to me.

10:41.932 --> 10:44.992
No, really. Look, look.
I'm not kidding.

10:46.237 --> 10:48.797
Well, it was there just a second ago.

10:49.006 --> 10:52.339
I swear, Rizzo.
It said, "Watch the sky."

10:52.910 --> 10:55.572
Are you sure it didn't say,
"You need help"?

10:58.449 --> 11:00.974
Maybe you and your cereal
want to be alone.

11:02.620 --> 11:04.349
Oh, boy.

11:05.523 --> 11:07.616
<i>My bologna has a first name</i>

11:07.825 --> 11:09.588
<i>It's O-S-C-A-R</i>

11:15.566 --> 11:16.863
Cool.

11:26.443 --> 11:28.138
"R U there"?

11:37.721 --> 11:42.283
<i>C.O.V.N.E.T.</i>
<i>Top secret national security facility.</i>

11:44.094 --> 11:45.391
<i>Mission:</i>

11:45.596 --> 11:49.726
<i>Investigate threat</i>
<i>of extraterrestrial attack...</i>

11:56.006 --> 11:59.464
<i>... cleverly disguised</i>
<i>as a cement factory.</i>

12:02.079 --> 12:03.979
General Luft, welcome.

12:04.181 --> 12:06.012
I'm on a schedule.
What have you got?

12:06.650 --> 12:08.140
Hard evidence.

12:08.352 --> 12:10.183
We finally got them.

12:11.455 --> 12:13.355
<i>- Rentro.</i>
- Yes, sir?

12:13.591 --> 12:14.922
The remote.

12:16.327 --> 12:18.158
The goat?

12:19.129 --> 12:21.620
The remote.

12:21.999 --> 12:24.092
I thought he said, "The goat."

12:24.301 --> 12:26.531
Overthe past few months...

12:27.771 --> 12:30.535
...we have received some
unusual communications.

12:30.774 --> 12:34.073
Communications, sir,
that are not of this Earth.

12:34.278 --> 12:35.472
- Really?
- Incoming.

12:35.679 --> 12:38.773
Sorry about that, general.
Here's your remote.

12:38.983 --> 12:41.474
Thank you, Rentro.

12:42.219 --> 12:45.086
We believe that aliens are using
a contact on Earth...

12:45.289 --> 12:47.450
...to plan their invasion.

12:48.192 --> 12:51.025
Now, this same message, "R U there"...

12:51.228 --> 12:53.287
...has appeared all overthe world.

12:55.466 --> 12:59.300
We've been lucky enough to capture
these instances on film.

13:00.204 --> 13:02.035
The pyramids at Giza.

13:03.974 --> 13:05.805
Stonehenge.

13:09.213 --> 13:11.374
Okay, now, this one says...

13:11.582 --> 13:15.382
..."R U three," but we believe that
to be a simple spelling error.

13:15.586 --> 13:18.054
This could be vandalism,
a practical joke.

13:18.255 --> 13:20.086
Now, you see that?

13:20.324 --> 13:23.521
That's what I said, general.
These photos are...

13:25.663 --> 13:27.221
I'll just be over here, then.

13:27.431 --> 13:28.762
Right this way, general.

13:29.099 --> 13:31.693
When I plotted
these anomalies sequentially...

13:31.902 --> 13:34.097
...a pattern emerged.

13:35.039 --> 13:36.529
A spiral.

13:38.842 --> 13:40.434
Do you see the spiral?

13:41.445 --> 13:45.404
Sir, they are out there.
They are coming here.

13:45.683 --> 13:49.380
Do you have any idea
what you have here, Singer?

13:49.586 --> 13:51.076
I have an inkling.

13:51.422 --> 13:52.320
<i>Bubkes.</i>

13:52.589 --> 13:53.954
<i>- Bubkes...</i>
- Good day.

13:54.158 --> 13:57.389
But, sir, we have to take action now.

13:57.728 --> 14:00.492
I hired you to find me an alien.

14:01.231 --> 14:04.689
And you bring me doctored photos
and a spiral.

14:04.969 --> 14:08.166
You are on thin ice, boy.

14:11.075 --> 14:13.134
I gotta hand it to you, sir.

14:13.344 --> 14:16.905
I thought your presentation
was just wonderful.

14:26.357 --> 14:27.984
Whoop, there it is.

14:30.394 --> 14:32.828
Roberta. Dolores.

14:34.865 --> 14:36.628
Shannanay!

14:37.935 --> 14:40.096
What should I do with the bills?

14:40.304 --> 14:43.171
- Just leave them inside.
- All right.

14:43.374 --> 14:46.605
Gonzo, do you want your new issue
of <i>Insanity Fair?</i>.

14:46.810 --> 14:48.835
No, I'll get it later.

15:01.625 --> 15:03.388
What is he doing up there?

15:03.594 --> 15:06.529
His breakfast cereal told him
to sit on the roof.

15:06.764 --> 15:09.096
Talk about whole-grain and nuts!

15:23.847 --> 15:25.371
Cool!

15:48.539 --> 15:50.006
Cool!

16:06.490 --> 16:08.617
This could be painful.

16:11.161 --> 16:12.594
It is. It is!

16:17.901 --> 16:20.369
Greetings, Mr. Gonzo. Greetings!

16:20.571 --> 16:22.801
What are you guys? Space fish?

16:23.006 --> 16:26.237
We are cosmic knowledge fish.
We know many, many things.

16:26.443 --> 16:28.741
- Would you like some tea?
- No, thanks.

16:28.946 --> 16:32.712
Mr. Gonzo, your people have been trying
to reach you.

16:32.916 --> 16:34.781
My people? Are they fish too?

16:36.587 --> 16:37.986
We're not the same as you.

16:38.188 --> 16:41.214
We are highly evolved beings.

16:41.492 --> 16:42.789
Now, if...

16:43.026 --> 16:44.459
What was I saying?

16:44.661 --> 16:45.753
My people.

16:46.096 --> 16:48.030
- Oh, yes.
- Excellent.

16:48.499 --> 16:51.229
Mow the lawn if you wish to
find what you seek.

16:51.435 --> 16:53.096
I should mow the lawn?

16:53.804 --> 16:56.466
A lawn that is cut
in your own words, Gonzo.

16:56.673 --> 16:59.699
- A message that can be seen from space.
- Space!

16:59.910 --> 17:00.899
So trim it well.

17:01.211 --> 17:04.942
Goodbye, Gonzo.
And may the fish be with you.

17:05.148 --> 17:07.446
Thanks, guys, forthe cosmic knowledge.

17:07.651 --> 17:09.642
Goodbye, Mr. Gonzo.

17:29.006 --> 17:30.473
That's it!

17:32.342 --> 17:34.071
Come on, Rizzo. Time to bet, okay.

17:34.311 --> 17:37.940
All right, prawn cracker.
I'll see your Maryland crab cakes...

17:38.148 --> 17:41.447
...and I'll raise you
a 1958 cheddar cheese...

17:41.652 --> 17:44.052
...never been sniffed.

17:44.755 --> 17:46.780
- Crab cakes and cheese?
- Can't beat that.

17:46.990 --> 17:48.457
Hey, guys!

17:48.725 --> 17:50.955
The cosmic fish have spoken to me.

17:51.161 --> 17:53.391
I'm from outer space!

17:53.597 --> 17:55.030
Yeah, yeah, that's great.

17:55.232 --> 17:56.961
- Pepe, are you in or out?
- I'm in.

17:57.167 --> 17:58.361
I'm an alien!

17:58.569 --> 18:00.594
You been tap-dancing
on your barbecue?

18:00.804 --> 18:03.671
No, no, Rizzo. I'm just fine.

18:07.344 --> 18:09.073
My cards!

18:09.279 --> 18:11.247
Somebody get a fire extinguisher!

18:15.185 --> 18:16.709
Are you sure you're okay?

18:16.920 --> 18:19.150
Absolutely. But I have to respond.

18:19.356 --> 18:20.846
Gotta make contact.

18:22.559 --> 18:23.583
Where's he going?

18:23.794 --> 18:25.728
Who cares? Flying saucer, maybe.

18:25.929 --> 18:27.556
<i>Dos</i> deuces.

18:27.931 --> 18:29.899
The prawn crackerwins.

18:30.100 --> 18:34.594
Pair of twos! I swear,
I had four aces. I really did.

18:34.805 --> 18:37.569
<i>You got to know when to hold it</i>

18:38.675 --> 18:40.336
<i>Know when to fold it</i>

19:19.116 --> 19:21.812
Just a few things fortoday,
sir.

19:22.052 --> 19:23.451
Here's a winner.

19:23.654 --> 19:26.953
Your <i>Platinum Buns</i> workout tape.

19:28.592 --> 19:30.526
And let's see...

19:30.727 --> 19:32.922
That new satellite photo is here...

19:33.130 --> 19:35.189
...my Captain Kangaroo pajamas...
- What?

19:35.399 --> 19:36.991
What satellite photo?

19:41.138 --> 19:44.130
"I am here."

19:44.408 --> 19:46.308
Mowed in the lawn.

19:46.643 --> 19:48.634
Who did this?

19:56.853 --> 19:59.253
This is not good.

20:00.957 --> 20:02.857
Poor guy. He's hallucinating.

20:03.093 --> 20:04.924
Getting weird messages.

20:05.128 --> 20:06.186
Hearing things.

20:06.396 --> 20:08.796
He listens to voices
and does what they say.

20:09.266 --> 20:10.824
Hold your horseshoes.

20:12.135 --> 20:14.603
I think I've got an idea.

20:14.805 --> 20:15.965
You're scary.

20:17.974 --> 20:19.908
I have to call Luft.

20:21.011 --> 20:22.273
Wait. Careful.

20:22.479 --> 20:23.571
Careful.

20:23.780 --> 20:24.610
Baby steps.

20:24.815 --> 20:26.476
Baby steps.

20:26.683 --> 20:27.877
We need more evidence.

20:28.085 --> 20:29.143
More evidence.

20:29.353 --> 20:31.321
Remember, we're just watching.

20:31.521 --> 20:32.749
Watching.

20:32.956 --> 20:35.220
- And waiting.
- Waiting.

20:39.696 --> 20:43.029
Build it and we will come.

20:44.067 --> 20:45.557
Build what?

20:45.769 --> 20:48.169
Build a Jacuzzi...

20:48.372 --> 20:51.739
...and we will come, okay.

20:53.410 --> 20:55.344
I'm up. I'm up.

20:59.182 --> 21:02.242
Must build Jacuzzi.

21:04.020 --> 21:06.818
- Well done, pal.
<i>- Gracias, amigo.</i>

21:10.527 --> 21:13.826
Put a little more paprika
on those, okay? Thank you.

21:14.030 --> 21:16.430
Well, that's everything.

21:18.902 --> 21:21.666
- He built it.
- And we came!

21:22.038 --> 21:25.496
Remember, I built this new
Jacuzzi for my alien family...

21:25.709 --> 21:27.574
...so no eating in the spa.

21:28.745 --> 21:31.270
We gotta tell him the truth, Pepe.

21:31.748 --> 21:33.238
You tell him...

21:33.450 --> 21:35.008
...and I will smack you.

21:35.218 --> 21:37.880
I will smack you like
a bad, bad donkey, okay.

21:39.256 --> 21:41.121
- Sal.
- Yeah, Johnny.

21:41.324 --> 21:42.655
There are no cannolis.

21:42.859 --> 21:45.760
Yeah, but try this cake.
This is a beauty.

21:45.962 --> 21:48.123
That is nice. Would you...
Gonzo!

21:48.331 --> 21:51.357
Go easy on the buffet, fellas.
I just want...

21:51.601 --> 21:53.967
Who cut the cake? Who cut the cake?

21:54.571 --> 21:56.300
- Who cut it?
- Look at that.

21:56.506 --> 21:59.669
- Who cut this cake?
- That's awful. They would've done...

21:59.876 --> 22:03.277
I can't believe it. The guests
of honor aren't even here yet.

22:03.480 --> 22:04.970
Hey, great party!

22:05.816 --> 22:08.216
I just wish they'd get here.

22:08.452 --> 22:11.216
Hey, you! Did you cut Gonzo's cake?

22:12.989 --> 22:15.583
I wonder if there is life
on other planets.

22:15.792 --> 22:19.125
What do you care?
You don't have a life on this planet.

22:22.332 --> 22:24.596
<i>Are you ready?</i>
<i>The Galaxy Channel presents...</i>

22:24.901 --> 22:29.304

22:29.506 --> 22:31.337
<i>Hello, I'mShelley Snipes.</i>

22:31.541 --> 22:33.668
<i>Coming up on</i> UFO Mania Live...

22:33.910 --> 22:37.471
<i>... I'll be taking a hard look</i>
<i>at some compelling new data.</i>

22:37.681 --> 22:41.777
<i>Have you seen something in the sky</i>
<i>but were afraid to talk about it?</i>

22:42.285 --> 22:44.913
I don't understand why
they didn't show up.

22:45.121 --> 22:47.248
Well, perhaps we can be of assistance.

22:47.457 --> 22:50.221
I think we can help you contact
your alien brethren...

22:50.427 --> 22:53.294
...by boosting your newly enhanced
conductivity.

22:53.497 --> 22:56.125
Okay, Beakie. Let her rip.

22:59.836 --> 23:02.600
Wait a minute.
I think I'm picking up a signal.

23:04.875 --> 23:06.740
<i>If you've had contact</i>
<i>with an alien...</i>

23:06.943 --> 23:10.037
<i>... or if you are an alien</i>
<i>and want to tell your story...</i>

23:10.280 --> 23:12.373
<i>... write to us or come to our studio.</i>

23:12.582 --> 23:16.245
<i>Come to our studio</i>
<i>at 6577 Broadcast Lane now.</i>

23:16.453 --> 23:19.854
The mother ship is calling me home!

23:21.124 --> 23:22.716
Thanks, guys.

23:23.627 --> 23:26.824
The mother ship! It worked.
The mother ship!

23:27.831 --> 23:29.856
Good, good, good. Beaker?

23:30.066 --> 23:32.159
You said you going to tell him, okay.

23:32.369 --> 23:35.964
The Jacuzzi thing was your idea,
and you have to tell him.

23:36.306 --> 23:37.705
<i>Sí,</i> I will tell him, okay.

23:37.908 --> 23:40.706
- They're calling me!
- Here he comes.

23:40.911 --> 23:43.311
I can't talk now, guys.

23:43.847 --> 23:46.111
- You should've told him.
- I wasn't supposed to!

23:46.316 --> 23:48.750
- You said you'd tell him.
- I said, you!

24:06.903 --> 24:08.666
Hi, guys. I'm here.

24:09.239 --> 24:11.867
Just leave the tractor here
in front, okay?

24:12.842 --> 24:14.571
And that's the way it is.

24:14.778 --> 24:18.509
This is Miss Piggy saying
good night and have a great...

24:18.715 --> 24:20.842
Where's my coffee?

24:22.852 --> 24:25.184
I'm coming! Coming!

24:29.426 --> 24:30.950
- I'll take one.
- In a minute.

24:31.161 --> 24:33.095
Light, no sugar.

24:33.296 --> 24:36.595
Shelley's stuck at the airport.
She won't make it on time.

24:36.800 --> 24:40.395
Okay, I am not gonna panic.
Who am I kidding? Yes, I am.

24:40.604 --> 24:42.196
No, I'm not.

24:42.405 --> 24:46.569
Okay, I'm panicking. Who can we
possibly get at the last minute? Who?

24:48.712 --> 24:50.145
Cappuccino?

24:51.114 --> 24:52.240
Stand by, everybody.

24:52.449 --> 24:53.711
Roll tape, please.

24:53.917 --> 24:55.885
And cue I.D.

24:56.086 --> 25:00.546
We're on in five... four... three... two...

25:07.764 --> 25:09.891
Look! It's Piggy's new show.

25:13.837 --> 25:15.134
Read! Read!

25:17.507 --> 25:20.999
"Hello again. I'm Shelley Snipes."

25:23.279 --> 25:25.770
Today on <i>UFO Mania:</i> Flying saucers...

25:25.982 --> 25:28.576
...and their extraterrestrial pilots.

25:29.219 --> 25:32.586
- Wish I could find my pants.
- You should come to see this.

25:32.789 --> 25:34.950
<i>"I'msure you've often wondered...</i>

25:35.158 --> 25:38.093
<i>... What might those alien creatures</i>
<i>look like?"</i>

25:39.095 --> 25:41.256
People of Earth, do not be alarmed.

25:41.464 --> 25:43.523
<i>My message will be brief.</i>

25:43.733 --> 25:45.860
I am Gonzo.

25:47.904 --> 25:49.667
I don't have a Gonzo.

25:49.873 --> 25:51.807
<i>There seems to be some mistake.</i>

25:52.008 --> 25:54.203
Dang!
You better get down there, Kerm.

25:54.411 --> 25:57.107
Relax. No one is going anywhere, okay?

25:57.313 --> 26:01.010
<i>You see, I was contacted through</i>
<i>my breakfast cereal...</i>

26:01.217 --> 26:03.708
<i>... and it was confirmed</i>
<i>by the cosmic fish...</i>

26:03.920 --> 26:05.785
<i>... that I amfromouter space.</i>

26:07.457 --> 26:10.893
So you wanna go now
orwait forthe commercial?

26:11.361 --> 26:13.226
Now. Come on.

26:14.064 --> 26:15.827
What are you doing here?

26:16.032 --> 26:18.523
I'm making contact.
What are you doing?

26:19.069 --> 26:20.229
Interview him.

26:21.071 --> 26:23.539
I'm interviewing...
I'm interviewing you!

26:24.374 --> 26:26.672
Great! What would you like to know?

26:26.876 --> 26:30.835
<i>The whole tearful tale</i>
<i>of your inner struggle, Gonzo.</i>

26:31.347 --> 26:35.716
<i>I want my people to know I've received</i>
<i>their messages, and my response is...</i>

26:35.919 --> 26:37.352
<i>... I am here.</i>

26:38.054 --> 26:40.318
"I am here."

26:41.658 --> 26:43.057
Bingo.

26:44.661 --> 26:48.859
<i>I'mat 44 Bronson Lane,</i>
<i>and I can't wait to meet you.</i>

26:49.065 --> 26:51.625
And I can't wait to meet you.

26:51.835 --> 26:54.360
Me too. He's very charismatic,
don't you think?

26:54.571 --> 26:55.663
Freeze that!

26:56.439 --> 26:59.499
- I want him here and I want him now.
- Yes, sir.

26:59.709 --> 27:04.078
So you're ourfancy little landscaper.

27:04.848 --> 27:06.372
We're gonna take a break.

27:08.451 --> 27:11.318
We are going to pause,
and we'll be back with Gonzo...

27:11.521 --> 27:13.250
...the geek who fell to Earth...

27:13.456 --> 27:16.050
...with <i>moi,</i> Miss...
- And we're out.

27:16.259 --> 27:18.284
Ninety seconds, folks.

27:18.495 --> 27:20.429
Now that is TV.

27:20.764 --> 27:24.564
The phones are lighting up like Vegas.
What power! You're a hit!

27:24.768 --> 27:25.700
Thank you.

27:25.902 --> 27:27.631
Not you. Him.

27:27.837 --> 27:29.168
- Me?
- You've got it.

27:29.372 --> 27:31.067
Sure wish we could find a cure.

27:35.211 --> 27:36.200
What's going on?

27:36.412 --> 27:40.041
Listen, aren't you taking
this alien thing a little too far?

27:40.250 --> 27:45.017
Kermit, I realize that it may be hard
for you to accept me as an alien...

27:45.221 --> 27:47.121
...but I didn't choose to be one.

27:48.024 --> 27:50.891
Well, I've always had
alien tendencies.

27:51.094 --> 27:52.459
This just makes sense.

27:52.662 --> 27:53.924
Beautiful, big G.

27:54.130 --> 27:56.530
- I see a follow-up episode here.
- Me too.

27:56.733 --> 27:59.998
"The Alien In My Life."
A Miss Piggy special report.

28:00.203 --> 28:02.137
What? You're the coffee pig.

28:04.207 --> 28:06.675
Kermit, he's such a joker.

28:06.876 --> 28:08.468
We'll take this from here.

28:10.013 --> 28:13.540
We're with the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Aliens.

28:13.750 --> 28:15.012
We feel your pain.

28:15.218 --> 28:16.515
They feel my pain.

28:16.719 --> 28:19.950
I got a paper cut that's a doozy.
You feel my pain too?

28:20.156 --> 28:22.920
Can you help me make contact
with my alien tribe?

28:23.159 --> 28:24.786
Yes, we can, Gonzo.

28:24.994 --> 28:27.588
Somebody believes me.
Come on, fellas.

28:27.797 --> 28:29.389
Take me to my leader.

28:30.934 --> 28:33.664
I don't like the look of them.
This rat smells a rat.

28:33.870 --> 28:35.735
The limo's right this way.

28:35.939 --> 28:38.703
Did he say limo?
Wait, I'm his translator.

28:38.908 --> 28:41.240
Wait!
You know this Gonzo, right?

28:43.179 --> 28:45.044
- If the price is right.
- The price?

28:46.516 --> 28:47.414
Look.

28:47.617 --> 28:50.450
I deliver Gonzo's exclusive
live story, okay...

28:50.687 --> 28:53.281
...if you make <i>moi</i>
your new anchorwoman.

28:53.489 --> 28:56.219
We're back in 15 seconds.

28:56.526 --> 28:59.359
- What about Shelley?
- Shelley's smelly!

28:59.562 --> 29:02.224
- Yes, yes! Go.
- All right!

29:05.869 --> 29:06.836
Excuse me.

29:08.705 --> 29:11.640
Excuse me. Hey, studmuffin, hold it.

29:12.375 --> 29:13.603
I'll deal with her.

29:14.944 --> 29:16.707
You'll deal with <i>moi.</i>

29:16.913 --> 29:19.609
Look, chumpo, I'm just trying to
get a story.

29:19.816 --> 29:21.215
How about this story?

29:21.818 --> 29:24.048
It's about a big bad wolf
and a little pig.

29:24.254 --> 29:25.881
No, that's three pigs, okay?

29:26.089 --> 29:27.647
Not in this version.

29:28.958 --> 29:32.860
Wait a minute. You're not part of
that alien-protection agency.

29:33.062 --> 29:36.498
Who are you?
Where are you taking Gonzo?

29:39.068 --> 29:40.626
I'm impressed.

29:44.140 --> 29:46.734
Black belt, third degree.

29:50.046 --> 29:52.537
Platinum belt,
with an unlimited line of credit.

29:52.749 --> 29:54.444
I like this party.

29:56.219 --> 29:59.154
Tough guy. Tough guy!

30:00.390 --> 30:01.721
Come on. Show me!

30:01.925 --> 30:03.290
Look! Cindy Crawford.

30:07.563 --> 30:10.054
Where have you been all my life?

30:13.770 --> 30:15.397
Is that all you got?

30:15.605 --> 30:17.266
Is that all you got?

30:22.879 --> 30:24.847
Not the noogie!

30:32.722 --> 30:34.189
Mama!

30:38.261 --> 30:39.819
What the hey?

30:40.863 --> 30:42.592
Gonzo! Gonzo! Gonzo!

30:42.932 --> 30:44.695
There are no aliens here.

30:44.901 --> 30:48.337
Only good, old-fashioned,
hard-working Americans.

30:49.172 --> 30:50.469
Good grief.

30:50.673 --> 30:52.231
Now get off my Kentucky bluegrass.

30:53.109 --> 30:55.134
Look! It's a little green man.

30:57.180 --> 31:00.172
Excuse me, but what are
all you people doing here?

31:00.383 --> 31:03.819
We were drawn here by the alien.

31:07.991 --> 31:08.821
<i>That's all I know.</i>

31:09.292 --> 31:11.283
So let me get this straight now.

31:11.494 --> 31:15.897
This government agency, C.O.V.N.E.T.,
has abducted Gonzo...

31:16.099 --> 31:18.294
...and taken him
to its top-secret facility?

31:18.501 --> 31:20.059
Yes, Miss Piggy.

31:20.670 --> 31:22.934
Thank you.
You've been most helpful.

31:23.272 --> 31:25.900
At last! A real story.

31:26.109 --> 31:28.669
Intrigue, danger, new outfits.

31:28.878 --> 31:31.608
And it's mine, mine, mine!
All mine!

31:33.783 --> 31:37.480
Come on, please. You think
Ted Koppel never gets excited?

31:39.489 --> 31:43.050
So this is the carthat
takes us to the limo, right?

31:43.393 --> 31:45.122
Somebody should look
at those shocks.

31:45.828 --> 31:49.457
At least they carried our stuff.
Don't hold your breath for a tip.

31:53.436 --> 31:56.564
As ambassador of Earth...

31:56.773 --> 31:59.003
...I welcome you.

32:03.079 --> 32:03.909
I'm Edgar...

32:04.580 --> 32:07.515
...but I want you to call me Ed.

32:07.817 --> 32:09.079
That's Ed.

32:09.352 --> 32:12.753
And it's an honor
to meet you, Mr. Gonzo.

32:12.955 --> 32:14.582
Yeah. Me too.

32:14.791 --> 32:16.224
Hors d'oeuvres!

32:16.626 --> 32:17.593
Please...

32:17.794 --> 32:20.592
...won't you sit?

32:21.064 --> 32:22.361
Thanks.

32:23.566 --> 32:25.557
Careful, careful.
You'll get gas.

32:25.935 --> 32:29.894
So when do we begin, Ed?
I'm very excited about all this.

32:31.707 --> 32:33.106
Me too, my friend.

32:34.277 --> 32:35.744
Me too.

32:40.016 --> 32:41.347
Kermie!

32:43.186 --> 32:44.414
Kermie! Everybody!

32:44.620 --> 32:45.780
Come here.

32:46.355 --> 32:49.688
Listen, everyone, listen.
I've got great news!

32:49.892 --> 32:52.383
Gonzo has been kidnapped
by the government...

32:52.595 --> 32:55.257
...and it could be
a life-threatening situation!

32:55.465 --> 32:57.262
How can that be great news?

32:57.467 --> 32:58.297
Because...

32:59.702 --> 33:02.865
...l've got the story!
I've got the story!

33:04.173 --> 33:08.200
I need to change. Something that
says, "Journalistic integrity."

33:09.178 --> 33:11.669
- I've gotta pee.
- Oh, brother!

33:12.949 --> 33:14.382
What are we gonna do?

33:14.584 --> 33:16.245
Okay, guys, it's up to us.

33:16.452 --> 33:19.717
We have to save Gonzo from
a whole army of government agents.

33:19.922 --> 33:21.719
Well, I have a joke book.

33:21.958 --> 33:23.619
Drumsticks! Drumsticks!

33:23.826 --> 33:25.953
I have some loose Jell-O, okay.

33:27.130 --> 33:29.189
Okay. Well, that settles that.

33:29.398 --> 33:33.528
In circumstances like this,
there's only one place to turn.

33:38.107 --> 33:40.132
- What do you got, Bunsen?
- There you are.

33:40.343 --> 33:43.938
Well, here at Muppet Labs,
we've come up with many devices...

33:44.147 --> 33:47.139
...that should aid you
in your covert operations.

33:47.950 --> 33:50.680
This seemingly ordinary
rubber ducky...

33:50.887 --> 33:53.447
...actually contains
invisibility spray.

33:53.656 --> 33:56.716
However, the effect is,
sadly, temporary.

33:56.926 --> 34:00.589
The old rubber-ducky-with-
invisibility-spray trick. Check.

34:00.796 --> 34:02.263
And, Beaker, if you would.

34:02.465 --> 34:05.093
Here is something that
we're very excited about.

34:06.602 --> 34:07.534
"Door in a jar"?

34:09.804 --> 34:11.705
That's absolutely right, Beakie.

34:11.908 --> 34:14.376
All you do is open up the jar...

34:14.610 --> 34:16.668
...fling the contents
onto the wall, and poof!

34:17.612 --> 34:19.012
Instant door.

34:19.315 --> 34:23.342
What is this?
A secret communication device?

34:23.553 --> 34:25.885
That's Scotch tape.
Useful if something tears.

34:31.460 --> 34:35.054
And what do you have for <i>moi?</i>.

34:37.667 --> 34:42.036
Well, Miss Piggy, for you
we have Muppet Labs Mind Mist.

34:42.237 --> 34:44.206
Simply spray it on the subject...

34:44.407 --> 34:46.739
...and they will obey
your every command.

34:54.984 --> 34:56.610
I doubt I'll need any.

34:56.819 --> 34:59.310
Okay, guys, let's go get Gonzo.

34:59.522 --> 35:01.012
<i>- Vámonos!</i>
- Come on.

35:01.224 --> 35:02.782
We'll find him, okay.

35:07.630 --> 35:11.464
I've been looking for
something like you...

35:13.069 --> 35:14.366
...all my life.

35:14.837 --> 35:16.998
And now, at last, my search...

35:18.074 --> 35:19.974
...has come to an end.

35:22.612 --> 35:23.442
May I?

35:23.646 --> 35:25.705
Before you answer,
you better be clear...

35:25.915 --> 35:28.406
...on the final destination
of that finger.

35:36.125 --> 35:37.615
Thanks.

35:46.035 --> 35:47.627
No nostrils.

35:49.205 --> 35:50.536
How do you smell?

35:50.740 --> 35:53.265
Awful. Trust me, I'm his roommate.

35:55.344 --> 35:56.811
That's a killer!

36:01.117 --> 36:01.947
Don't...

36:03.119 --> 36:04.711
...laugh...

36:05.021 --> 36:07.080
...at me!

36:15.264 --> 36:19.633
I hope I'm not imposing, but I
thought you were just great on TV.

36:19.835 --> 36:21.735
Could I get your autograph?

36:23.072 --> 36:24.096
It's not a good time.

36:24.840 --> 36:26.865
This is probably not a good time.

36:28.344 --> 36:31.040
Forgive me my earthly manners.

36:31.647 --> 36:35.378
But do you have any idea
what it's like...

36:36.686 --> 36:37.948
...to be laughed at?

36:38.154 --> 36:39.485
Sure, I do.

36:39.689 --> 36:42.351
To be called names like "wacko"?

36:42.892 --> 36:44.154
And "freak boy"?

36:45.294 --> 36:47.956
And paranoid delusional psychopath?

36:48.197 --> 36:49.129
Got me there.

36:49.298 --> 36:50.492
To feel...

36:51.100 --> 36:55.093
...completely alone
in this world?

36:55.304 --> 36:59.172
I think we're starting to get
the general idea there, Ed.

37:10.119 --> 37:12.883
It's wrestling legend
Hollywood Hulk Hogan?!

37:13.489 --> 37:16.754
Have the rat sent down
to Dr. Tuckerfor some tests.

37:16.959 --> 37:20.326
But I haven't studied.
I don't even have a number-two pencil!

37:21.497 --> 37:23.761
This is for all my NWO-ites out there.

37:23.966 --> 37:26.059
I will continue to dominate wrestling.

37:26.268 --> 37:29.726
I'll make your back crack, your knees
freeze and your liver quiver.

37:30.139 --> 37:34.235
I will continue to put so much pain
on you, you'll become my "painiac."

37:34.810 --> 37:35.708
Hollywood.

37:35.911 --> 37:38.311
Would you mind? The rat.

37:41.784 --> 37:43.308
Where you going with my friend?

37:43.519 --> 37:44.884
What will yourfans think?

37:45.087 --> 37:48.147
Hey, what you gonna to do?
I'm a bad guy now.

37:49.258 --> 37:50.691
Gonzo, help me!

37:56.065 --> 37:57.692
He's going to be fine.

38:18.687 --> 38:19.847
How you doing? I'm Bubba.

38:20.923 --> 38:22.720
Rizzo. Nice to meet you.

38:22.925 --> 38:25.860
Nice to meet you.
How'd you like to meet the boys?

38:26.061 --> 38:27.187
Sure.

38:27.396 --> 38:30.388
Up there, that's Fast Eddie,
harmonica extraordinaire.

38:30.599 --> 38:32.499
- How you doing, Ed?
- I ain't dead.

38:32.868 --> 38:34.495
Over here's Troy.

38:35.171 --> 38:37.036
This back here, that's Shakes.

38:37.239 --> 38:39.332
Hi. How you doing? Welcome.

38:40.042 --> 38:42.533
They're doing a new
caffeine substitute on him.

38:42.745 --> 38:44.042
That's the Birdman.

38:44.413 --> 38:45.812
Where are you? Gladys?

38:46.015 --> 38:48.074
He don't bother nobody.
He's been here forever.

38:50.019 --> 38:52.852
Gladys! Come on,
the guys are watching.

38:53.055 --> 38:55.785
He just likes to hang out
with his birds.

38:56.158 --> 39:00.822
So that about does it for all
of us here at Medical Research.

39:01.697 --> 39:02.891
Medical Research?

39:03.532 --> 39:05.625
But that would mean we're...

39:05.835 --> 39:07.029
...lab rats!

39:07.336 --> 39:10.271
Gonzo, get me out of here!

39:11.574 --> 39:14.475
Now, Mr. Gonzo.

39:16.745 --> 39:18.406
What can you tell me about these?

39:19.114 --> 39:22.106
They really have been looking for me.

39:22.318 --> 39:25.481
- And they are coming to Earth?
- I don't know.

39:25.688 --> 39:27.747
- How many are there?
- I don't know.

39:27.957 --> 39:29.754
When will they be here?

39:29.959 --> 39:33.258
And don't you dare tell me...

39:33.863 --> 39:36.593
...that you don't know.

39:38.067 --> 39:39.227
I know not?

39:44.173 --> 39:46.266
But maybe I could find out?

39:46.976 --> 39:48.341
Could you?

39:50.980 --> 39:52.208
Well!

39:52.681 --> 39:55.809
Okay, then.
I'll keep in touch. Thanks.

39:58.921 --> 40:00.980
So back to the limo?

40:03.125 --> 40:05.093
It's a shame, really.

40:05.494 --> 40:07.962
I really need that information.

40:10.266 --> 40:12.530
So I'm afraid
we'll have to perform...

40:12.735 --> 40:15.499
...an invasive quadra-lobal
brain probe on you...

40:15.704 --> 40:17.865
...and pluck it from your head.

40:18.507 --> 40:20.168
The information?

40:20.376 --> 40:22.435
No, your brain. Take him away.

40:22.645 --> 40:25.876
My brain?
But just a second. I...

40:26.081 --> 40:28.174
- Where are you taking me?
- Get General Luft.

40:28.384 --> 40:30.944
I need my brain.

40:35.558 --> 40:37.890
Tell me again.
Why are we doing this?

40:38.093 --> 40:39.788
To save Gonzo.

40:42.164 --> 40:43.961
Right.
Because Gonzo's one of us.

40:44.166 --> 40:47.533
No matterwhat happens, no matter
what obstacles we face...

40:47.736 --> 40:49.533
...we neverforget one of our own.

40:49.772 --> 40:52.070
I love it when you take charge.

40:52.575 --> 40:56.033
We left Bunsen and Beaker
back at the gas station.

40:57.980 --> 41:00.141
From now on,
no matterwhat happens...

41:00.349 --> 41:02.510
...we neverforget one of our own.

41:02.718 --> 41:03.810
That's right.

41:08.524 --> 41:09.957
Cheese Twiddle?

41:10.659 --> 41:12.650
Is this movie time or something?

41:16.565 --> 41:17.862
So you're the new guy.

41:18.734 --> 41:21.999
From this moment on, if I say
you're hungry, you eat.

41:22.204 --> 41:23.694
If I say you're sleepy...

41:23.906 --> 41:25.066
I eat?

41:26.208 --> 41:28.301
Oh, you shouldn't have...

41:28.510 --> 41:31.741
Well, well, well.
We got a funny boy here.

41:31.947 --> 41:33.471
- Is that bad?
- Very bad.

41:33.682 --> 41:36.173
It looks like funny boy's
going to the maze.

41:37.186 --> 41:39.552
Since we don't want funny boy
to get lonely...

41:39.755 --> 41:41.985
...you'll all do time
in the maze.

41:42.291 --> 41:43.451
I'm sorry.

41:44.860 --> 41:47.727
See, no one's ever escaped
from the maze, funny boy.

41:47.930 --> 41:50.125
And even if you did,
it's fourfeet to the ground...

41:50.399 --> 41:53.527
...twelve feet to the door
and fourfeet to the doorknob.

41:54.169 --> 41:55.864
- That's 18 feet.
- Twenty.

41:56.071 --> 41:59.598
Funny thing about doorknobs:
Rats can't turn them.

41:59.808 --> 42:01.901
No opposable thumb.

42:22.765 --> 42:24.630
This is ridiculous!

42:30.839 --> 42:33.273
Hey, Riz, watch out
forthem red circles.

42:33.475 --> 42:34.965
What's wrong with the red...

42:37.680 --> 42:39.409
Nobody ever listens.

42:40.849 --> 42:43.249
Red circles. Right.

42:45.387 --> 42:46.445
Now let me see.

42:46.655 --> 42:50.523
Cheese, rat poison.
Cheese, rat poison.

42:51.460 --> 42:54.793
What do you guys think, I'm crazy?
This is a no-brainer.

42:56.965 --> 43:01.095
This ain't so bad.
A little breezy. Oh, boy.

43:04.640 --> 43:08.098
Auntie Em, it's a twister!

43:10.379 --> 43:12.973
This is just like
one of those carny rides.

43:13.182 --> 43:16.674
You just gotta hang on, and at
the end I get some cotton candy.

43:21.557 --> 43:23.548
I'm gonna hurl!

43:26.295 --> 43:28.627
You're just trying
to play mind games here.

43:28.831 --> 43:30.958
But I know the cheese is safe...

43:31.166 --> 43:34.829
...because you think I'm going
forthe poison, right?

43:46.982 --> 43:48.745
Room service.

43:53.856 --> 43:56.017
Hey there, little fella.
How you doing?

43:56.225 --> 44:00.093
While they're warming up the brain
sucker, I brought you a sandwich.

44:00.295 --> 44:03.628
And I cut off the crusts there
for you. There you go.

44:03.932 --> 44:05.923
Gee, that's nice. Thanks.

44:06.135 --> 44:07.966
Anything for a celebrity.

44:09.938 --> 44:11.064
Do you like jalapeños?

44:11.306 --> 44:12.238
Sure.

44:13.642 --> 44:14.939
<i>Jalapeños</i>

44:21.416 --> 44:22.906
Hey, mopey!

44:25.454 --> 44:27.445
- Who said that?
- I did.

44:27.656 --> 44:29.385
But you're just a sandwich.

44:29.591 --> 44:33.891
I'm channeling my voice through
this sandwich to deliverthis message.

44:34.096 --> 44:36.121
Great! What's the message?

44:37.032 --> 44:39.466
We arrive at midnight tonight.

44:39.902 --> 44:42.871
Really? And do all of you
look like sandwiches?

44:43.071 --> 44:45.096
- Forget about the sandwich!
- I'm sorry.

44:45.307 --> 44:49.573
<i>Jalapeños, jalapeños</i>
<i>Getting my friend some jalapeños</i>

44:49.778 --> 44:52.804
So here's the plan:
We're landing at your house.

44:53.015 --> 44:56.041
No, no, wait.
Those guys know where I live.

44:56.251 --> 44:59.118
And they're not the best
examples of Earthlings.

44:59.321 --> 45:00.982
Gosh, where else can we land?

45:01.190 --> 45:04.125
Let's see...
I know! At the beach.

45:04.326 --> 45:06.658
Go to Cape Doom.
Just look forthe lighthouse.

45:06.862 --> 45:08.693
The lighthouse at Cape Doom it is.

45:08.897 --> 45:10.990
Oh, boy. I didn't hear that.

45:11.200 --> 45:14.169
This is great.
But how do I get out of here?

45:14.369 --> 45:16.064
I'm just a sandwich.

45:16.271 --> 45:18.796
Some things you gotta
figure out for yourself.

45:19.007 --> 45:21.532
By the way, you go ahead
and eat me now.

45:21.743 --> 45:23.677
You're gonna need the energy.

45:27.382 --> 45:30.783
- But won't that hurt?
- No, it's fine. I'm going away now.

45:32.387 --> 45:35.584
- Cape Doom, right?
- Yes, Cape Doom.

45:36.191 --> 45:37.453
Are you there?

45:38.961 --> 45:40.155
Hello?

45:52.708 --> 45:54.801
Just a little further up.

45:55.244 --> 45:57.804
- Stop, Fozzie. Stop here.
- That's it.

45:59.581 --> 46:00.809
Sorry.

46:36.084 --> 46:37.210
Animal!

46:37.819 --> 46:39.446
Sorry.

46:46.828 --> 46:51.128
Stand back, boys.
This is a job for a woman.

46:53.468 --> 46:54.662
Woman.

46:58.573 --> 47:02.737
What's a nice man like you doing
in a guardhouse like this?

47:02.945 --> 47:05.436
I'm buffalo hunting.
What's it look like I'm doing?

47:05.647 --> 47:07.945
This is a restricted area.
You gotta go.

47:08.150 --> 47:09.208
Oh, no.

47:09.918 --> 47:13.115
Look deeply into my eyes
and tell me you want me to go.

47:13.322 --> 47:16.814
I want you to go!

47:17.025 --> 47:18.014
Understand?

47:18.226 --> 47:19.352
Now!

47:26.034 --> 47:26.932
I thought I...

47:32.407 --> 47:33.237
What was I saying?

47:33.442 --> 47:36.434
You were saying you were
going to open the gate.

47:39.348 --> 47:40.872
Open the gate.

47:41.083 --> 47:44.109
Of course, open the gate.
Come on in. Welcome!

47:44.353 --> 47:45.786
Come on, guys!

47:47.723 --> 47:49.213
Tell me I'm beautiful, sweetheart.

47:49.891 --> 47:52.621
You are beautiful, sweetheart.

47:52.828 --> 47:54.352
Thank you.

47:55.097 --> 47:57.497
He fell on you
like a ton of bricks, okay.

47:57.699 --> 47:58.927
<i>Naturellement.</i>

47:59.134 --> 48:00.761
- Have a nice time.
<i>- Gracias.</i>

48:00.969 --> 48:03.961
- I like yourtie. Very nice.
- Thank you.

48:04.506 --> 48:05.973
- So long.
- Bye-bye!

48:08.210 --> 48:10.110
What a handsome family.

48:13.648 --> 48:15.309
Hey, rodents.

48:16.418 --> 48:18.648
You know the cheese I promised you...

48:18.854 --> 48:21.618
...afteryou ran that maze
and took those tests?

48:22.991 --> 48:25.186
It was delicious.

48:31.633 --> 48:33.225
No cheese?

48:33.902 --> 48:35.631
No cheese?!

48:35.837 --> 48:38.328
All right! That does it!

48:38.540 --> 48:41.065
We're busting out
of this joint, boys.

48:41.309 --> 48:45.769
Even if we got overthe wall,
we couldn't turn the doorknob.

48:46.448 --> 48:48.439
Who needs doorknobs?

49:01.563 --> 49:03.428
Very nice.

49:03.765 --> 49:04.732
He likes it.

49:09.971 --> 49:11.939
We gotta get through that door.

49:12.140 --> 49:15.701
Should we just ask permission from
those nice men with the rifles?

49:15.911 --> 49:17.344
Those are the bad guys.

49:18.680 --> 49:21.205
All right.
It's time to get invisible.

49:22.784 --> 49:23.842
Get the duck.

49:24.319 --> 49:26.514
- Yes, sir.
- Duckie!

49:27.155 --> 49:28.782
Here goes.

49:30.492 --> 49:32.392
- I look thinner.
- Now spray yourself.

49:37.799 --> 49:39.198
Hey, I like this.

49:39.401 --> 49:40.834
All right, lose the duck.

49:41.570 --> 49:44.801
Listen up, guys. This stuff
doesn't last long, so let's go.

49:46.441 --> 49:48.534
- You're squashing me.
- Sorry, Kermie.

49:48.743 --> 49:50.802
Come on, Kermit.
I will help you up, okay.

49:51.012 --> 49:53.572
Kermit, you're so soft and plump.

49:53.782 --> 49:56.410
You got one second to get
your hands off me, shrimp.

49:56.618 --> 49:57.915
Sorry, Piggy.

49:58.120 --> 49:59.348
Come on.

50:00.522 --> 50:03.150
I have to go to the little bear's room.

50:08.230 --> 50:10.858
Smoking is very bad for you, okay.

50:12.234 --> 50:13.360
Bob...

50:14.536 --> 50:16.231
...didn't know you cared.

50:18.440 --> 50:22.638
<i>Paging Dr. Van Neuter. Please</i>
<i>report to alien surgery number five.</i>

50:26.781 --> 50:28.874
I'm Dr. Van Neuter.

50:29.084 --> 50:32.212
I'll be your brain surgeon today,
if you don't mind.

50:32.587 --> 50:34.612
Get it? "Brain surgeon. Mind."

50:36.791 --> 50:39.191
Feeling a little nervous, are we?

50:39.394 --> 50:40.759
Of course I'm nervous.

50:40.962 --> 50:43.863
Everyone is
before having their brain sucked out.

50:44.065 --> 50:46.192
Now, don't you go away.

50:55.143 --> 50:56.576
Okay, Kermit, I'm ready.

50:56.778 --> 50:59.474
Fozzie, tell me
you didn't wash your hands.

50:59.681 --> 51:02.844
Of course I did.
Mom said, "Always wash your hands."

51:03.051 --> 51:05.747
Not when you're wearing
invisibility spray!

51:05.954 --> 51:08.582
Mom said, "No exceptions."

51:08.790 --> 51:10.655
Never, ever.

51:10.859 --> 51:11.848
What the...

51:12.060 --> 51:12.992
Stop!

51:13.195 --> 51:14.753
You, hands, up.

51:15.530 --> 51:17.293
All right, brother, remain calm.

51:17.499 --> 51:21.094
I'm gonna have to take
you two into custody.

51:21.469 --> 51:23.232
Wait. Let me explain, lady.

51:26.007 --> 51:27.668
Where are yourforearms?

51:29.844 --> 51:31.004
Woman!

51:32.214 --> 51:34.273
Animal, get back here!

51:38.320 --> 51:41.812
Give me a second to think.
He doesn't seem to be on this floor.

51:55.770 --> 51:58.136
I should go change, okay.

51:58.573 --> 52:01.599
Come on, everybody.
We need to find better cover.

52:06.114 --> 52:08.776
Just up ahead here,
General Luft, sir.

52:08.984 --> 52:10.576
There we go.

52:10.852 --> 52:14.549
This is our new
retinal scanner, general.

52:27.769 --> 52:31.170
- General Luft, sir.
- This had better be good.

52:33.742 --> 52:34.868
Come on, let's go.

52:39.681 --> 52:41.842
Hey, Riz. Where you going?

52:42.050 --> 52:45.451
Listen. You guys go ahead.
I gotta go find my friend.

52:45.654 --> 52:48.316
You could get caught.
What are you, nuts?

52:49.090 --> 52:50.853
I guess I'll take my chances.

52:51.059 --> 52:53.584
It was nice meeting you guys.
See you later.

52:54.262 --> 52:55.991
So long, Riz.

52:56.564 --> 52:58.054
Good luck.

52:58.400 --> 53:00.265
Kid's got moxie.

53:03.271 --> 53:04.795
What is moxie?

53:05.407 --> 53:06.931
Let's see here.

53:07.142 --> 53:11.044
Have you ever experienced
any achiness in yourtentacles?

53:11.246 --> 53:12.679
I don't have tentacles.

53:12.881 --> 53:15.611
Good, no achy tentacles. Good.

53:15.817 --> 53:18.012
- Head ever come off?
- I don't think so.

53:18.219 --> 53:19.914
Good, good, good.

53:20.488 --> 53:22.615
- Any gingivitis?
- No.

53:22.824 --> 53:23.654
Great.

53:23.858 --> 53:27.385
Ever had problems with that
beaky thing you've got there?

53:27.595 --> 53:29.119
Itching, swelling, flaking?

53:29.331 --> 53:31.799
- Some flaking a couple years ago.
- Oh, who cares.

53:32.133 --> 53:34.033
It's showtime!

53:35.170 --> 53:36.364
Here we go.

53:37.305 --> 53:39.000
Excellent, excellent.

53:40.075 --> 53:40.973
What's that thing?

53:41.476 --> 53:43.239
I don't know. Here we go.

53:44.179 --> 53:46.113
Just stay like that.

53:50.852 --> 53:52.080
This way.

53:52.287 --> 53:54.187
Whose bright idea was this, anyway?

53:54.389 --> 53:55.856
Which way, Kermit?

53:56.991 --> 53:58.117
This way.

53:59.127 --> 54:00.788
I can't breathe!

54:00.995 --> 54:01.825
Come on.

54:02.063 --> 54:03.052
Here we go.

54:03.264 --> 54:04.322
Wait!

54:04.666 --> 54:06.099
What is it?

54:06.301 --> 54:08.166
Is this covered by my HMO?

54:10.038 --> 54:12.404
Good question. I'll check.

54:18.179 --> 54:20.113
You're alive!
Where have you been?

54:20.315 --> 54:24.012
You don't want to know. Sit tight
while I chew through these straps.

54:25.153 --> 54:28.452
Good news. You're covered
with a $10 co-pay.

54:28.723 --> 54:30.088
Okay, hold still.

54:30.291 --> 54:34.591
And remember, if you experience any
unpleasantness, please let me know.

54:34.796 --> 54:35.888
I'd hate to miss it.

54:38.366 --> 54:40.926
- Do you mind?
- Excuse me.

54:42.337 --> 54:43.201
Wait!

54:43.405 --> 54:46.135
Oh, good Lord! A rat!
I hate rats!

54:46.341 --> 54:49.936
Then today ain't your lucky day, doc.

54:53.181 --> 54:55.376
- Ready for an operation?
- Let's experiment!

54:56.017 --> 54:57.575
Forward, Piggy.

55:05.493 --> 55:06.687
Doctor.

55:10.098 --> 55:13.329
- Just a couple of doctors.
- Doctors in the hallway.

55:14.436 --> 55:16.028
That was close.

55:17.105 --> 55:19.505
- To the right, Fozzie.
- Forward, Piggy.

55:20.675 --> 55:23.269
Too fast, too fast.
The door. Stop!

55:24.779 --> 55:26.974
What in the world?

55:28.650 --> 55:33.519
This is big, general. I think
we should notify the President.

55:33.721 --> 55:35.518
I'll be the judge of that.

55:35.723 --> 55:37.315
As always, sir.

55:37.525 --> 55:39.288
No, don't tickle me!

55:39.761 --> 55:43.094
- What do we do?
- Will you please get me out of here?

55:48.670 --> 55:49.898
I can't breathe!

55:52.340 --> 55:53.272
Hey, guys.

55:53.475 --> 55:55.568
Quick, get me out of here!

55:56.077 --> 55:57.408
Today, sir...

55:58.112 --> 56:00.376
...we must think with a big mind.

56:01.216 --> 56:02.410
Behold.

56:03.485 --> 56:07.387
Irrefutable evidence
of extraterrestrial life.

56:15.129 --> 56:17.461
Release me...

56:24.405 --> 56:27.636
This looks worse than it is, general.

56:27.842 --> 56:29.104
Obviously, the...

56:29.811 --> 56:31.574
Get off of me, you vermin!

56:32.013 --> 56:34.072
The alien is loose in the building.

56:34.282 --> 56:36.011
But not to worry because...

56:36.217 --> 56:37.514
Don't bother.

56:37.886 --> 56:39.478
You're terminated.

56:40.788 --> 56:44.155
- When you say terminated...
- You need help, Singer!

56:44.359 --> 56:45.849
Find some!

56:52.333 --> 56:55.564
Well, how'd that
go for you, then? Okay?

56:57.372 --> 57:00.899
So sorry I got you into this mess.
Thanks for coming to save me.

57:01.109 --> 57:03.134
You can thank us once
we're out of here.

57:03.344 --> 57:05.107
All right, quietly now.

57:07.215 --> 57:09.183
Stop! Come back here!

57:10.151 --> 57:11.982
Help! Mommy!

57:12.186 --> 57:14.154
Please, please.
Listen to me.

57:14.355 --> 57:16.084
You can't leave me.

57:16.291 --> 57:18.054
I need you.

57:25.466 --> 57:27.195
I go now.

57:27.402 --> 57:29.461
Fine. Go on, go.

57:29.971 --> 57:31.029
You're all alike.

57:32.640 --> 57:34.073
Animals.

57:37.946 --> 57:39.573
Call me.

57:43.885 --> 57:45.147
Come here.

57:45.687 --> 57:48.155
Way to go, Romeo.
Now, let's get out of here.

57:48.356 --> 57:49.323
Let's go.

57:49.857 --> 57:51.347
I'm gonna kill somebody.

57:51.559 --> 57:54.892
Now, now.
Remember, calm blue ocean.

57:55.096 --> 57:58.259
You let it go.
Baby steps, remember? Baby...

57:58.466 --> 58:00.457
Find the alien!

58:00.668 --> 58:01.692
Now!

58:02.136 --> 58:03.626
Yes, sir.

58:14.515 --> 58:16.540
- Try that door.
- It won't budge!

58:19.020 --> 58:20.578
Forget that door. Come on!

58:22.490 --> 58:23.548
This way!

58:25.627 --> 58:27.857
Fozzie, quick!
The door in a jar.

58:29.764 --> 58:31.288
"Open jar away from face."

58:31.499 --> 58:33.467
Will you please just open the jar?

58:33.668 --> 58:35.795
Hurry, Fozzie.
Come on, throw it!

58:43.344 --> 58:44.436
That's disappointing.

58:44.646 --> 58:47.206
Perfect. Somebody knock
and see if Barbie's home.

58:47.415 --> 58:49.713
Works for me. <i>Adiós</i>!

58:51.853 --> 58:53.013
What?!

58:54.055 --> 58:57.320
I cannot believe that
little shrimp left us behind!

58:57.558 --> 59:00.186
I am not a shrimp.
I am a king prawn!

59:00.495 --> 59:01.928
Let's go! Come on!

59:05.233 --> 59:06.461
Hurry, hurry!

59:11.205 --> 59:14.470
Keep going, everybody.
Don't look back. Run!

59:16.044 --> 59:17.909
- Did you have a good time?
- Thank you.

59:18.513 --> 59:20.447
Bye-bye, nice man.

59:23.518 --> 59:25.452
What the heck is going on?

59:26.287 --> 59:27.754
- We did it!
- See that?

59:27.955 --> 59:30.924
When we pull together,
we can do anything.

59:31.626 --> 59:34.686
Now we can go meet my alien
brothers at Cape Doom.

59:37.331 --> 59:40.129
What makes you think that
aliens are landing there?

59:40.535 --> 59:42.298
Oh, a sandwich told me.

59:42.737 --> 59:43.761
Oh, no.

59:44.138 --> 59:46.231
I'd give it a rest there, buddy.

59:46.441 --> 59:49.308
Do you mean that you guys
still don't believe me?

59:49.510 --> 59:50.340
Well...

59:50.545 --> 59:54.709
All right, fine. Stop the bus.
I'll get there by myself.

59:55.016 --> 59:57.041
No, no. Wait, Gonzo.

59:57.652 --> 01:00:00.314
It doesn't matterwhat we believe.

01:00:00.621 --> 01:00:05.217
If you believe that you need
to go and meet your alien brothers...

01:00:05.593 --> 01:00:06.855
...then I say...

01:00:07.061 --> 01:00:10.189
I say we're going to the beach.
Right, guys?

01:00:11.065 --> 01:00:11.895
To the beach, okay.

01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:13.294
To the beach.

01:00:13.568 --> 01:00:14.398
Great!

01:00:14.602 --> 01:00:16.695
Beach ball! Beach ball!

01:00:17.505 --> 01:00:19.666
Get the crew to Cape Doom
on the double.

01:00:19.874 --> 01:00:23.002
And look, this is my exclusive,
so don't tell anyone.

01:00:23.211 --> 01:00:24.200
I got it.

01:00:24.412 --> 01:00:28.439
Pack it up, guys! The spaceship
is landing at Cape Doom.

01:00:39.894 --> 01:00:41.486
Where is he?

01:00:42.597 --> 01:00:45.430
Well, I didn't overhear anything...

01:00:48.703 --> 01:00:51.536
Did I ask you
if you overheard anything?

01:00:52.073 --> 01:00:52.903
No, sir.

01:00:53.107 --> 01:00:55.439
Because if you did
overhear anything...

01:00:55.977 --> 01:00:57.968
...l'm sure you would tell me.

01:00:58.179 --> 01:00:59.669
Yes, sir.

01:01:00.648 --> 01:01:02.673
Or do I have to remind you...

01:01:02.884 --> 01:01:06.513
...of Mr. Jumbo's Circus Town
and Wild Animal Revue?

01:01:08.389 --> 01:01:09.549
Where's he going?

01:01:12.393 --> 01:01:14.088
Oh, look.

01:01:14.295 --> 01:01:16.763
Sunday's half price
at the petting zoo.

01:01:17.365 --> 01:01:19.993
Okay, okay!
They're going to Cape Doom.

01:01:20.201 --> 01:01:22.396
Good, good.

01:01:23.070 --> 01:01:25.800
Get me the subatomic
neutro-destabilizer.

01:01:28.042 --> 01:01:31.842
The subatomic neutro...
The really big gun.

01:01:32.046 --> 01:01:34.412
The really big gun. Yes, sir.

01:01:34.615 --> 01:01:36.207
The really big gun.

01:01:41.355 --> 01:01:42.982
Really big gun.

01:01:43.424 --> 01:01:44.254
Clip.

01:01:44.525 --> 01:01:45.719
Clip!

01:01:50.364 --> 01:01:52.355
Let's head for my car.

01:01:52.567 --> 01:01:54.057
Problem there, sir.

01:01:54.735 --> 01:01:58.694
Rememberthose parking tickets
you asked me to take care of for you?

01:01:58.906 --> 01:02:00.373
And I said that...

01:02:01.242 --> 01:02:03.540
Oh, just say it.

01:02:03.845 --> 01:02:05.506
Car's impounded.

01:02:08.716 --> 01:02:10.411
We can take my company car.

01:02:10.618 --> 01:02:12.415
- Fine.
- Great.

01:02:12.987 --> 01:02:16.184
<i>66 bottles of beer on the wall</i>
<i>66 bottles of beer</i>

01:02:16.390 --> 01:02:17.414
Excuse me.

01:02:17.625 --> 01:02:21.561
Excuse me!
Can this thing go any faster?

01:02:22.029 --> 01:02:23.326
I'm doing 30.

01:02:23.531 --> 01:02:25.931
You want to slow down there, buddy?

01:02:26.133 --> 01:02:29.967
A lot of traffic tonight, sir.
Safety first.

01:02:52.493 --> 01:02:54.723
What's with all these crazy people?

01:02:54.929 --> 01:02:58.831
Can I help it if <i>moi</i>
has such devoted fans?

01:03:00.568 --> 01:03:02.160
Gonzo! Gonzo!

01:03:02.370 --> 01:03:04.235
All right, everybody, back off!

01:03:04.438 --> 01:03:06.633
Make way forthe alien!
Let His Weirdness through.

01:03:06.841 --> 01:03:08.172
Everybody be cool.

01:03:08.376 --> 01:03:10.071
Stay back. Be cool, okay.

01:03:13.714 --> 01:03:16.547
Get your Gonzo T-shirts right here.
Ten bucks.

01:03:19.153 --> 01:03:21.815
Goodbye, Rainbow, and stay groovy.

01:03:43.611 --> 01:03:45.078
Got cold.

01:03:45.846 --> 01:03:47.313
Sure did.

01:03:47.548 --> 01:03:52.212
Midnight. The lone alien
stands before a naked sky.

01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:54.115
The mood is tense.

01:03:54.455 --> 01:03:55.945
My hair looks great.

01:03:56.857 --> 01:03:59.485
I don't believe this!

01:03:59.927 --> 01:04:00.951
Shelley! <i>Bonjour.</i>

01:04:01.162 --> 01:04:04.131
You backstabbing, underhanded
little coffee pig.

01:04:04.332 --> 01:04:06.095
- What?
- This is my show!

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:08.427
My story, my microphone.

01:04:09.470 --> 01:04:12.530
Shelley Snipes reporting.
Please ignore the little sow.

01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:14.105
Disregard this woman. I...

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.695
What am I doing?

01:04:42.937 --> 01:04:46.100
You are about to give me your job
and get everyone here coffee.

01:04:46.307 --> 01:04:47.899
Oh, yes. Of course.

01:04:48.109 --> 01:04:49.633
Right away.

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:55.212
I love this stuff.

01:04:55.683 --> 01:04:56.809
How you doing?

01:04:57.018 --> 01:04:58.645
Excuse me, buddy.

01:04:58.853 --> 01:05:01.117
And a happy Halloween to you as well.

01:05:03.758 --> 01:05:06.124
It's all right. Take it easy.

01:05:06.327 --> 01:05:07.760
- Yeah, yeah.
- All right.

01:05:07.962 --> 01:05:11.489
You don't understand.
We let him slide, and he gave us a ride.

01:05:11.699 --> 01:05:14.429
Yeah, yeah.
I love all my new rat friends now.

01:05:14.635 --> 01:05:16.899
Come on.
Who wants this next marshmallow?

01:05:17.104 --> 01:05:18.571
Can you believe that?

01:05:18.773 --> 01:05:21.640
Hey, fellas!
Look who's here over here.

01:05:24.378 --> 01:05:26.243
It's too bad Dawson isn't here.

01:05:26.447 --> 01:05:29.905
Tell me about it. This is like
one of his sci-fi movies.

01:05:30.117 --> 01:05:33.245
But this is a Muppet movie.
It's much more realistic...

01:05:34.288 --> 01:05:36.722
...and romantic, okay.

01:05:37.091 --> 01:05:38.251
Right.

01:05:38.626 --> 01:05:40.856
What's your deal?
Are you an alien or something?

01:05:41.062 --> 01:05:43.530
No, baby.
Me and Gonzo are very tight.

01:05:43.731 --> 01:05:45.995
We'll be chilling
in our hot tub later on.

01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:48.828
Perhaps you'd like
to partake in the party.

01:05:50.704 --> 01:05:51.932
Geeks.

01:05:52.473 --> 01:05:55.601
All right. Don't answer right away.
We'll be here.

01:05:55.810 --> 01:05:57.471
Oh, she'll be back.

01:06:04.418 --> 01:06:06.283
One a.m.

01:06:06.554 --> 01:06:09.990
The alien is still
standing overthere.

01:06:10.191 --> 01:06:12.250
My hair still looks great.

01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:14.121
One can only wonder...

01:06:14.328 --> 01:06:18.025
...what Gonzo's feeling right now.

01:06:21.368 --> 01:06:22.892
They're not coming.

01:06:24.105 --> 01:06:26.300
Maybe they're just running late.

01:06:26.607 --> 01:06:28.234
It's a no-show.

01:06:29.243 --> 01:06:30.267
What?

01:06:30.678 --> 01:06:33.670
Hey, wait a second.
I believed you, man.

01:06:35.382 --> 01:06:38.010
I stayed up all night dancing...

01:06:38.219 --> 01:06:40.847
...and didn't study forfinals
because of you.

01:06:41.055 --> 01:06:43.455
I'm cold. Come on, let's go.

01:06:49.163 --> 01:06:50.425
I'm out of here.

01:07:04.812 --> 01:07:06.074
Look!

01:08:03.170 --> 01:08:04.262
Boy!

01:08:04.471 --> 01:08:06.564
They're really tiny.

01:08:08.342 --> 01:08:11.505
But tiny's not a bad thing, right?

01:08:12.446 --> 01:08:14.380
No. Tiny's good.

01:08:14.582 --> 01:08:19.178
We came out here in the middle
of the night for a stupid egg?

01:08:19.386 --> 01:08:21.877
It could be full of chocolate, okay.

01:09:13.707 --> 01:09:15.537
Shoot it! Shoot it!

01:09:29.689 --> 01:09:32.180
Please, Big Boss,
I never disobeyed my mother.

01:09:32.393 --> 01:09:36.022
And I never carried the plague.
Not even once!

01:10:09.763 --> 01:10:12.926
- Are you okay, Gonzo?
- Great. Neverfelt better.

01:10:25.612 --> 01:10:28.206
Let the one who is called...

01:10:28.415 --> 01:10:31.077
...Gonzo step forward.

01:10:31.852 --> 01:10:33.183
That's me!

01:10:35.155 --> 01:10:36.281
I'm Gonzo.

01:10:36.490 --> 01:10:39.118
Step a little closer.

01:10:42.463 --> 01:10:45.261
Come a little furtherforward.

01:10:47.468 --> 01:10:48.867
Lean into the light.

01:10:49.636 --> 01:10:52.628
There you go.
Lean in a little further.

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:54.671
A little further.

01:10:57.144 --> 01:10:58.372
That's him!

01:11:07.821 --> 01:11:09.812
<i>Many zotons ago...</i>

01:11:10.057 --> 01:11:12.321
<i>... you were lost to us.</i>

01:11:12.526 --> 01:11:16.826
<i>We've come a long way looking</i>
<i>for you, little brother.</i>

01:11:20.667 --> 01:11:22.726
<i>We know of but one way...</i>

01:11:22.936 --> 01:11:26.303
<i>... to express our happiness</i>
<i>at having found you.</i>

01:11:37.751 --> 01:11:40.811
<i>Nowthere's a party going on right here</i>

01:11:41.655 --> 01:11:43.054
<i>A celebration</i>

01:11:43.257 --> 01:11:45.282
That's my family!

01:11:45.492 --> 01:11:49.690
<i>So bring your good times</i>
<i>And your laughter too</i>

01:11:50.097 --> 01:11:53.430
<i>We're gonna celebrate</i>
<i>Your party with you</i>

01:11:53.834 --> 01:11:56.928
<i>Celebration</i>

01:11:58.071 --> 01:12:01.529
<i>Let's all celebrate</i>
<i>And have a good time</i>

01:12:01.742 --> 01:12:04.711
<i>Celebration</i>

01:12:05.813 --> 01:12:09.146
<i>We're gonna celebrate</i>
<i>And have a good time</i>

01:12:10.184 --> 01:12:13.278
<i>It's time to come together</i>

01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:17.112
<i>It's up to you</i>
<i>What's your pleasure</i>

01:12:17.324 --> 01:12:21.351
<i>Everyone around the world</i>
<i>Come on</i>

01:12:21.562 --> 01:12:24.429
<i>Celebrate good times</i>

01:12:24.631 --> 01:12:25.893
<i>Come on</i>

01:12:26.934 --> 01:12:28.868
<i>It's a celebration</i>

01:12:34.641 --> 01:12:36.871
<i>It's a celebration</i>

01:12:44.618 --> 01:12:47.314
Come on, Gonzo. I want
to see you up here on the stage!

01:12:47.521 --> 01:12:49.682
- Me?
- Yeah, you, boy!

01:12:54.595 --> 01:12:57.120
Look at him go, guys.
Look at him up there!

01:12:58.332 --> 01:13:02.598
<i>Celebrate good times</i>
<i>Come on</i>

01:13:07.774 --> 01:13:09.833
It's The Great Gonzo!

01:13:12.379 --> 01:13:13.846
This way.

01:13:17.951 --> 01:13:22.320
It is time to take your righteous
place amongst your brothers.

01:13:22.523 --> 01:13:23.615
Thanks...

01:13:23.824 --> 01:13:25.155
Here you go.

01:13:25.359 --> 01:13:29.523
By surviving and thriving alone
on this alien planet...

01:13:29.730 --> 01:13:32.198
...you have proven
yourself audacious...

01:13:32.399 --> 01:13:34.959
...courageous and
distinctly one of a kind.

01:13:35.469 --> 01:13:38.267
We welcome you back
with our most...

01:13:38.472 --> 01:13:40.269
...ceremonious of ceremonies.

01:13:40.474 --> 01:13:41.634
What's that?

01:13:42.342 --> 01:13:44.173
We gonna blow you up, baby.

01:13:53.353 --> 01:13:54.980
Yes, yes, yes!

01:13:59.059 --> 01:14:00.856
<i>Arriba!</i>

01:14:01.728 --> 01:14:04.196
I love these people!

01:14:04.531 --> 01:14:06.123
Coming down!

01:14:09.836 --> 01:14:11.565
Cowabunga!

01:14:22.316 --> 01:14:23.647
Where's he gone?

01:14:30.324 --> 01:14:32.815
He's okay! He's all right.

01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:37.226
Now that is what I call
The Great Gonzo.

01:14:38.765 --> 01:14:40.756
It's so good to see you.

01:14:53.213 --> 01:14:54.510
Hold it!

01:14:55.716 --> 01:14:57.274
Hold it.

01:14:58.185 --> 01:15:00.619
Get out of the way, you freak.

01:15:02.356 --> 01:15:05.587
Very, very moving,
my little alien friend.

01:15:06.426 --> 01:15:08.894
But I'm afraid yourtiming is off.

01:15:09.096 --> 01:15:10.256
Now...

01:15:10.464 --> 01:15:12.898
...you're coming back with me...

01:15:14.001 --> 01:15:16.469
...in my cement truck.

01:15:20.273 --> 01:15:21.865
What's so funny?

01:15:24.978 --> 01:15:26.843
Don't laugh at me.

01:15:27.047 --> 01:15:29.174
Don't laugh...
All right.

01:15:30.417 --> 01:15:32.078
I'll show you laughter!

01:15:35.022 --> 01:15:36.250
<i>Please load weapon.</i>

01:15:37.124 --> 01:15:39.183
<i>Please load weapon.</i>

01:15:44.731 --> 01:15:46.289
Come on.

01:15:57.344 --> 01:15:58.538
My toe!

01:15:59.413 --> 01:16:02.348
This certainly is good!

01:16:03.583 --> 01:16:05.380
That was a close one.

01:16:06.353 --> 01:16:08.685
Not as close as you think, my friend.

01:16:08.889 --> 01:16:11.255
"Please load weapon."

01:16:17.698 --> 01:16:21.930
- We are honored to meet you.
- A most extraordinary performance.

01:16:22.602 --> 01:16:24.229
What are you talking about?

01:16:24.571 --> 01:16:29.099
Gonzo of Earth, who is this most
entertaining friend of yours?

01:16:29.309 --> 01:16:30.537
That's Ed.

01:16:32.446 --> 01:16:34.243
The cape!

01:16:34.648 --> 01:16:36.616
The cape for Ed.

01:16:37.050 --> 01:16:40.076
Ed, because of your comic instincts...

01:16:40.487 --> 01:16:44.287
...we have chosen you
as ambassadorto our planet.

01:16:46.927 --> 01:16:49.760
You mean you want me to go with you?

01:16:54.201 --> 01:16:57.170
"To boldly go where
no man has gone before"?

01:16:57.370 --> 01:16:59.634
It would be our great privilege.

01:17:01.675 --> 01:17:04.735
May I call you Zongo?

01:17:08.014 --> 01:17:12.314
To travel the stars
like a modern-day Magellan.

01:17:12.886 --> 01:17:16.014
To be up there with John Glenn...

01:17:16.223 --> 01:17:17.815
...Neil Armstrong.

01:17:18.191 --> 01:17:21.251
I think you better get going.
They're waiting for you.

01:17:21.461 --> 01:17:22.553
Run along now.

01:17:22.763 --> 01:17:24.958
This way, Zongo.

01:17:30.337 --> 01:17:32.202
Baby steps, sir.

01:17:32.739 --> 01:17:34.673
Baby steps.

01:17:35.175 --> 01:17:36.642
Time to beat feet.

01:17:36.843 --> 01:17:39.243
Come along, little brother.

01:17:40.714 --> 01:17:41.874
Oh, boy.

01:17:43.416 --> 01:17:44.974
This is happening so fast.

01:17:46.453 --> 01:17:47.920
Well, guys...

01:17:49.389 --> 01:17:52.722
...l'm gonna miss you.
And I'll be thinking about you.

01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:54.190
Rizzo, buddy...

01:17:54.394 --> 01:17:57.693
No, no, not me.
I do not do goodbyes.

01:17:57.898 --> 01:17:59.729
Well, I just want to tell you...

01:18:00.767 --> 01:18:03.395
I just want you
to take care of yourself.

01:18:03.937 --> 01:18:05.928
Don't worry about me. I...

01:18:06.139 --> 01:18:08.471
I can always get another roommate.

01:18:09.109 --> 01:18:10.371
Oh, buddy.

01:18:13.180 --> 01:18:15.444
- Take care.
- You too.

01:18:16.783 --> 01:18:18.250
And, Kermit...

01:18:19.152 --> 01:18:21.586
...you're the best friend
any alien could ask for.

01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:25.753
We love you, Gonzo.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.433
So you'll write?

01:18:35.769 --> 01:18:37.532
Yeah, sure, I'll write.

01:18:37.737 --> 01:18:40.205
There's probably a mailbox
every couple of light-years.

01:18:41.908 --> 01:18:44.069
<i>Adiós,</i> Mr. Spaceman, okay.

01:18:44.611 --> 01:18:48.547
Man, you keep saying goodbye,
and you'll never get home.

01:18:49.683 --> 01:18:50.775
Home.

01:18:55.288 --> 01:18:56.983
Time to go home.

01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:16.966
The stars beckon.

01:19:19.279 --> 01:19:21.509
Shall we go home?

01:19:30.123 --> 01:19:31.249
I don't think so.

01:19:37.664 --> 01:19:40.895
Thank you for going
to so much trouble to find me.

01:19:43.203 --> 01:19:44.693
But I can't go.

01:19:48.708 --> 01:19:50.801
I love these guys.

01:19:52.579 --> 01:19:54.410
My life is here.

01:19:55.749 --> 01:19:58.240
This is my home.

01:20:01.154 --> 01:20:03.554
If that is your decision...

01:20:03.757 --> 01:20:06.191
...then we shall abide by it.

01:20:07.093 --> 01:20:08.321
We will miss you.

01:20:10.463 --> 01:20:12.294
So good luck, Gonzo.

01:20:16.136 --> 01:20:19.071
People of Earth, later.

01:20:19.272 --> 01:20:20.330
Yes!

01:20:22.776 --> 01:20:23.674
Oh, boy.

01:20:23.877 --> 01:20:25.174
