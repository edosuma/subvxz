00:01.001 --> 00:03.635
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:06.773 --> 00:09.274
"Dear, Mike Tyson
Mystery Team,
my name is Edward Kunt,

00:09.309 --> 00:12.010
"and recently, I discovered
I have an identical
twin brother

00:12.045 --> 00:13.378
"whom I've never met.

00:13.413 --> 00:15.047
"Could you please
help me find him?

00:15.082 --> 00:17.449
"Best regards,
Edward Kunt."

00:17.484 --> 00:18.950
Hmm.

00:18.985 --> 00:22.220
Probably didn't need
to write my full name twice.

00:22.255 --> 00:25.057
Here, little pigeon.
(CLICKS TONGUE)

00:25.959 --> 00:27.326
There you go.

00:28.128 --> 00:29.728
(GROANS)

00:29.763 --> 00:31.763
Son of a bitch.
How the hell
does anyone do this?

00:31.798 --> 00:34.533
MARQUESS: (SIGHS)
We shouldn't condone
this behavior.

00:34.568 --> 00:37.903
It's errand day, Marquess.
Everybody gets to choose
one errand.

00:37.938 --> 00:41.106
And Pigeon wanted
to go the park
so he could buy some drugs.

00:44.311 --> 00:46.078
Forty bucks
for half ounce.

00:46.113 --> 00:49.648
(SCOFFS) Either the market
for crystal meth
fell off a cliff,

00:49.683 --> 00:52.684
or I just bought
a bag of rat poison.

00:52.719 --> 00:54.653
Well, only one way
to find out.

00:59.459 --> 01:00.358
Finally.

01:00.393 --> 01:03.095
Hmm. That's not rat poison,

01:03.130 --> 01:04.763
but also I'm not
getting that

01:04.798 --> 01:08.900
hard-dicked,
crazy crystal meth
tingle either.

01:08.935 --> 01:11.470
Jesus, what the (BLEEP)
is happening to my legs?

01:11.505 --> 01:13.371
Oh, (BLEEP)
This is horrible!

01:13.406 --> 01:15.107
My blood is thick.

01:15.142 --> 01:17.909
My brain is freezing cold.

01:17.944 --> 01:19.611
Everything is...

01:22.716 --> 01:24.216
What is he doing?

01:27.554 --> 01:30.189
Is that something
we should be
concerned with?

01:30.924 --> 01:32.257
There you go, little guy.

01:32.292 --> 01:35.160
Now, go find
the Mike Tyson Mystery Team.

01:35.195 --> 01:37.396
-Fly!
-MARQUESS: Pigeon!

01:39.299 --> 01:41.333
Oh, my God.
You're here!

01:41.368 --> 01:43.201
Oh, I was trying
to send you this.

01:43.236 --> 01:44.803
"Dear, Mike Tyson
Mystery Team,

01:44.838 --> 01:46.138
"my name is Edward (BLEEP)"

01:46.173 --> 01:48.974
Oh, actually it's
pronounced Kunt.

01:49.009 --> 01:52.878
"...and recently I discovered
that I have
an identical twin brother

01:52.913 --> 01:54.513
"whom I've never met before.

01:54.548 --> 01:56.214
"Can you please
help me find him?

01:56.249 --> 01:57.983
"Best regards,
Edward (BLEEP)"

01:58.018 --> 01:59.651
Kunt.

01:59.686 --> 02:02.087
Well, Mr. (BLEEP),
that sounds like
an amazing mystery.

02:02.122 --> 02:05.123
And we'd love to
help you find your
identical twin brother.

02:05.158 --> 02:07.125
Unfortunately, we have
a strict policy

02:07.160 --> 02:10.495
that we never take mysteries
when we're out
in the general public.

02:10.530 --> 02:12.597
All mysteries must be
attached to a pigeon,

02:12.632 --> 02:14.733
which must fly
to our home

02:14.768 --> 02:17.602
where a member of our team
will process it and submit it
for approval,

02:17.637 --> 02:20.606
which could take
anywhere from
immediately to never.

02:22.809 --> 02:24.309
Whoa.

02:24.344 --> 02:27.312
That was transcendent.

02:29.616 --> 02:30.949
Hey, guys.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.350
You got a new mystery here.

02:32.385 --> 02:34.319
Whoa, you still
live here, Deezy?

02:34.354 --> 02:36.221
Not for long. Not for long.

02:36.256 --> 02:38.557
I just put in an application
on an apartment
over by the airport.

02:38.592 --> 02:41.459
And I should hear something
in the next little bit.
Very soon I'm sure.

02:41.494 --> 02:43.328
"Dear, Mike Tyson
Mystery Team,

02:43.363 --> 02:45.230
"my name is Edward (BLEEP)

02:45.265 --> 02:48.533
"and recently, I discovered
that I have an identical
twin brother

02:48.568 --> 02:50.168
"whom I've never met."

02:50.203 --> 02:52.671
Wait. (BLEEP) sounds familiar.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.272
Have we met a (BLEEP) before?

02:54.307 --> 02:56.174
I could swear,
we met a (BLEEP).

02:56.209 --> 02:57.842
Yung, do you remember
a (BLEEP)?

02:57.877 --> 03:00.579
Hmm, (BLEEP).

03:00.614 --> 03:02.581
(BLEEP)

03:02.616 --> 03:04.583
For God's sakes,
you idiots are the (BLEEP).

03:04.618 --> 03:06.685
The name is obviously
pronounced Kunt.

03:06.720 --> 03:09.487
Have you never met
anybody named Kunt?

03:09.522 --> 03:11.756
By God, it's a common surname.

03:11.791 --> 03:13.191
Why, when I was boy,

03:13.226 --> 03:15.093
the family at
the end of the lane,

03:15.128 --> 03:17.095
they spelled it with a "C",

03:17.130 --> 03:19.231
and they pronounced it Kunt.

03:19.266 --> 03:21.533
Oh, yes, I remember well.

03:21.568 --> 03:24.369
Harry Cunt
and his wife Ima.

03:24.404 --> 03:25.570
"Ima Cunt."

03:25.605 --> 03:27.272
And he had
two lovely daughters,

03:27.307 --> 03:29.307
Yura and Bea.

03:29.342 --> 03:31.376
"Yura Cunt
and Bea Cunt."

03:31.411 --> 03:33.812
To the Mystery Mobile.

03:36.316 --> 03:39.384
Hey, Edward.
We have got your mystery
and we are all here

03:39.419 --> 03:41.453
to help you find
your identical twin brother.

03:41.488 --> 03:44.256
Oh, uh, I sent that
so long ago.

03:44.291 --> 03:45.757
Like, a year ago.

03:45.792 --> 03:48.326
Hey, hey, we get this
bullshit complaint a lot.

03:48.361 --> 03:51.963
It's like, "Why does it take
so long from the time
I wrote my message

03:51.998 --> 03:53.765
"to you for you to get it?"

03:53.800 --> 03:56.868
All I can say is
these are birds we're
dealing with, okay?

03:56.903 --> 03:58.970
Birds, that have no idea
where I live.

03:59.005 --> 04:02.340
It is a miracle
any birds with any
mystery messages

04:02.375 --> 04:04.175
ever end up at my house.

04:04.210 --> 04:07.145
So take your complaint
and shove it up your ass,
mother (BLEEP).

04:07.180 --> 04:09.714
Now let's go find
your twin brother,
mother (BLEEP).

04:09.749 --> 04:12.217
-Michael?
-I'm sorry, I just don't
like complainers.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.985
Never had, never will.

04:14.020 --> 04:16.855
But do you know
what I really
cannot stand?

04:16.890 --> 04:18.123
All this heat lately.

04:18.158 --> 04:20.725
I have no energy
and the reason
is the heat.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.894
I just want it to be fall,
but then, it's like,

04:22.929 --> 04:25.497
you go somewhere,
you gotta remember
to bring a jacket.

04:25.532 --> 04:27.098
I don't need that headache.

04:27.133 --> 04:28.933
Life is hard. FML.

04:28.968 --> 04:31.403
I'm over it.
I'm sick and tired
and over it.

04:31.438 --> 04:34.339
But don't listen to me.
I just like
to complain sometimes.

04:34.374 --> 04:36.875
Okay, so back to
finding your twin brother.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.543
Oh, I already found him.

04:38.578 --> 04:40.879
When I didn't hear from
you guys, I hired
a private investigator.

04:40.914 --> 04:43.315
Apparently, we were both
given to an orphanage
as babies

04:43.350 --> 04:44.883
and then adopted
by separate families.

04:44.918 --> 04:47.585
-His name's Thomas.
He lives near Reno.
-Oh.

04:47.620 --> 04:50.255
Ugh, I feel bad.
You came all this way.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.223
Well, do you have
any other mysteries?

04:52.258 --> 04:53.491
Uh...

04:53.526 --> 04:55.226
I don't think so.

04:55.261 --> 04:58.096
Okay, well, if you ever
need anything,
here's my card.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.831
"Tony Havrasian.

04:59.866 --> 05:02.567
"Home media installation
and repair."

05:02.602 --> 05:03.902
Aren't you Mike Tyson?

05:03.937 --> 05:06.071
Yeah, and that guy
gave me that card,

05:06.106 --> 05:07.472
and it's my card.

05:07.507 --> 05:08.873
And now, it's your card.

05:08.908 --> 05:10.475
And you'll give it
to someone,

05:10.510 --> 05:12.877
and then that person
will give it to someone,

05:12.912 --> 05:14.579
and so on, and so forth.

05:14.614 --> 05:16.481
It's called
the circle of life.

05:17.784 --> 05:19.785
You take care, Mr. (BLEEP).

05:24.190 --> 05:25.423
(CAR DOORS OPEN AND CLOSE)

05:25.458 --> 05:26.825
How did he beat us here?

05:26.860 --> 05:28.793
Dad, it takes us forever
to get anywhere

05:28.828 --> 05:30.895
because you refuse
to make left turns.

05:30.930 --> 05:33.598
Sixty-two percent of crashes
involve left turns

05:33.633 --> 05:36.634
as opposed to 3.1%
involving right turns.

05:36.669 --> 05:39.738
As they say,
"Three right turns
make a left."

05:39.773 --> 05:41.306
It'll maybe take
a little longer,

05:41.341 --> 05:43.908
but as they say,
"Sixty-two percent
of the crashes

05:43.943 --> 05:45.143
"involve left turns

05:45.178 --> 05:48.680
"as opposed to 3.1%
involving right turns."

05:48.715 --> 05:49.981
So, what is it, Edward?

05:50.016 --> 05:51.683
Oh, I'm not Edward.

05:51.718 --> 05:53.818
Oh, then you must be Thomas,

05:53.853 --> 05:55.120
from Reno?

05:55.155 --> 05:56.421
Uh, no.

05:56.456 --> 05:57.922
My name is Lawrence.

05:57.957 --> 06:00.024
I was hoping
you could help me.

06:00.059 --> 06:02.927
You see, I've recently
discovered that I have
identical twin brothers.

06:02.962 --> 06:04.796
I want you to
help me find them.

06:04.831 --> 06:06.765
So, Edward and Thomas
don't know about me?

06:06.800 --> 06:09.300
-I guess not.
-But you know
where they both live?

06:09.335 --> 06:10.735
Well, we know
where Edward lives.

06:10.770 --> 06:12.137
DEEZY: And Edward knows
where Thomas lives.

06:12.172 --> 06:13.671
-MARQUESS: Oh, my God.
-(LAWRENCE SCREAMS)

06:13.706 --> 06:15.039
Hey, Deezy, how you know
about any of this?

06:15.074 --> 06:16.908
You butt-dialed me
about three hours ago.

06:16.943 --> 06:18.810
I've been listening
to everything.

06:18.845 --> 06:21.079
You guys talk
a lot of shit about me
behind my back.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.349
EDWARD: It's just so much
to take in.

06:24.384 --> 06:25.784
When I found out
I was adopted,

06:25.819 --> 06:27.519
I wanted to meet
my birth parents,

06:27.554 --> 06:30.155
but the agency said
they couldn't reveal
their identities.

06:30.190 --> 06:33.324
But they did tell me
I had an identical twin.

06:33.359 --> 06:35.560
I wonder why
they didn't tell me
there were three of us.

06:35.595 --> 06:37.228
I'm sorry,
do you have any wine?

06:37.263 --> 06:39.364
I mean, we could all
go inside and have
a glass of wine.

06:39.399 --> 06:43.001
Not that I need wine.
It's just 4:30,
and I'm... I mean, I just...

06:43.036 --> 06:44.536
I just look
forward to it, okay?

06:44.571 --> 06:46.538
It's a thing
I look forward to.

06:47.307 --> 06:49.107
Let's go see Thomas.

06:49.142 --> 06:52.977
Ooh. Does this mean
that we're all going
to just outside of Reno?

06:53.012 --> 06:55.547
Ooh, that's number five
on my bucket list.

06:57.584 --> 07:00.752
-Incredible!
-After all these years.

07:00.787 --> 07:02.253
Who are you calling?

07:02.288 --> 07:05.490
Oh, why do you care?
Why are we even still here?

07:05.525 --> 07:07.192
I'm calling
the adoption agency.

07:07.227 --> 07:08.526
I want some answers.

07:08.561 --> 07:10.462
Starting with who are
our birth parents.

07:10.497 --> 07:11.696
Wait.

07:11.731 --> 07:13.298
I know who our
birth parents are.

07:13.333 --> 07:16.267
They raised me.
I wasn't put up
for adoption.

07:16.302 --> 07:17.569
Would you like to meet them?

07:17.604 --> 07:19.270
They live in
Medford, Massachusetts.

07:19.305 --> 07:21.739
No one's gonna believe me,
but number three
on my bucket list

07:21.774 --> 07:24.442
is go to Medford,
Massachusetts
and just hang out.

07:24.477 --> 07:28.313
Man, I'm crossing
shit off my bucket list
like crazy today.

07:28.348 --> 07:31.450
The name of this episode
should be,<i> The Bucket List.</i>

07:34.721 --> 07:37.622
Oh, we made it.
Thank goodness.

07:37.657 --> 07:40.091
It's just starting
to get crowded in here.

07:42.428 --> 07:44.162
Mother? Father?

07:44.197 --> 07:46.798
There are a couple
of gentlemen here
who would like to meet you.

07:46.833 --> 07:48.433
Who do you have
with you, Lawrence?

07:48.468 --> 07:50.268
Oh! What?

07:50.303 --> 07:52.370
Herman, you lied.

07:52.405 --> 07:54.105
I couldn't kill 'em, Stella.

07:54.140 --> 07:55.406
They were just babies.

07:55.441 --> 07:56.674
What are they talking about?

07:56.709 --> 07:58.009
I'll tell you.

07:58.044 --> 07:59.911
You deserve
to know the truth.

07:59.946 --> 08:02.213
Forty-three years ago,
your mother and I

08:02.248 --> 08:05.717
suffered the greatest loss
any parent can have.

08:05.752 --> 08:07.886
Our only child, Lawrence,

08:07.921 --> 08:11.422
was eaten by an alligator
while on an outing
to the zoo.

08:11.457 --> 08:14.592
I tried to pull him
out of the jaws
of that terrible beast,

08:14.627 --> 08:16.561
but all I got back
were his little feet.

08:16.596 --> 08:17.996
So, I raced back
to my lab,

08:18.031 --> 08:19.831
where I was doing
high-level cloning research,

08:19.866 --> 08:22.500
and I did what
any parent would do.

08:22.535 --> 08:25.370
I made a clone
of my own son.

08:25.405 --> 08:28.606
But, here's where
it gets tricky.

08:28.641 --> 08:30.642
I somehow ended up with three.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.644
No one wanted three.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.879
How would we
explain it to the neighbors?

08:34.914 --> 08:37.549
Where there was one boy
there are now three.

08:37.584 --> 08:39.751
We didn't know
what else to do.

08:39.786 --> 08:42.587
Herman assured me
it would be a painless death.

08:42.622 --> 08:44.822
But when I looked
into your eyes,

08:44.857 --> 08:47.525
you had Lawrence's eyes,
of course.

08:47.560 --> 08:50.228
I did what
any parent would do.

08:50.263 --> 08:52.497
I drove you
straight to the orphanage,

08:52.532 --> 08:54.232
hopefully, never to
see you again.

08:54.267 --> 08:57.702
Then some time ago,
I got a call.

08:57.737 --> 09:00.305
One of you was asking
about your birth parents.

09:00.340 --> 09:02.907
I knew that it was only
a matter of time

09:02.942 --> 09:04.342
before you found one another,

09:04.377 --> 09:07.045
and discover that you're
not identical triplets.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.413
You're clones.

09:08.448 --> 09:10.181
Clones of a sweet little boy

09:10.216 --> 09:13.151
long dead in the belly
of an alligator.

09:13.186 --> 09:16.154
So I sent Lawrence,
this Lawrence,
the fake Lawrence

09:16.189 --> 09:18.690
to find you two
and bring you here,

09:18.725 --> 09:21.192
so I could do what
any parent would do.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.393
Murder you!

09:22.428 --> 09:24.762
Okay, now, you keep
using that expression,

09:24.797 --> 09:26.598
"What any parent
would do" and I'm not sure--

09:26.633 --> 09:28.700
-Oh, my God!
-(YUNG HEE SCREAMS)

09:30.803 --> 09:32.036
LAWRENCE:
It had to be done, Father.

09:32.071 --> 09:33.371
-(GUNSHOT)
-(LAWRENCE GROANS)

09:33.406 --> 09:34.472
Herman!

09:34.507 --> 09:36.474
How could you kill our son?

09:36.509 --> 09:39.444
Our son died 43 years ago.

09:39.479 --> 09:43.214
Our mistake was simply doing
what any parent would do.

09:43.249 --> 09:44.482
My God!

09:44.517 --> 09:46.451
And now, I'm afraid
I have to kill all of you.

09:46.486 --> 09:49.687
-(GRUNTS)
-Wow, wow, I did it.
Number two on my bucket list.

09:49.722 --> 09:51.522
I just punched a man
in the face.

09:51.557 --> 09:53.691
That was the one
I never thought
I'd get to do.

09:53.726 --> 09:57.295
Under what circumstances
will I ever hit a man
right in his face?

09:57.330 --> 10:00.198
Now there's only
one thing left
on my list.

10:01.534 --> 10:03.501
-(GUN COCKS)
-Kill Pigeon.

10:03.536 --> 10:05.103
What?

10:05.138 --> 10:07.705
Number one on
my bucket list
is to kill Pigeon.

10:07.740 --> 10:09.107
Wha-- What the (BLEEP)
are you doing?

10:09.142 --> 10:11.009
(GASPS) This is
amazing, Michael.

10:11.044 --> 10:14.112
You're gonna complete
your entire bucket list today.

10:14.147 --> 10:16.147
What are you
waiting for, Dad? Do it.

10:16.182 --> 10:18.016
-Pull the trigger.
-PIGEON: What?

10:18.051 --> 10:20.518
Please. Please, no. No.

10:20.553 --> 10:22.387
What's the matter
with you people?

10:22.422 --> 10:23.822
(GUNSHOT)

10:28.928 --> 10:30.862
EDWARD: Oh, my God,
you're here.

10:30.897 --> 10:32.630
Oh, I was trying
to send you this.

10:32.665 --> 10:35.133
I recently discovered
I have an identical
twin brother,

10:35.168 --> 10:37.035
and I was hoping
you could help me find him.

10:37.070 --> 10:39.871
Oh, I don't wanna do that.
That sounds boring.

10:39.906 --> 10:41.873
If I had a bucket list,
which I don't,

10:41.908 --> 10:43.841
because I think
bucket lists are stupid,

10:43.876 --> 10:48.046
but if I did, helping finding
your twin brother
would not be on it.

10:48.081 --> 10:51.149
Come on, everyone.
We have to finish
running our errands.

10:53.386 --> 10:54.886
Wow.

10:54.921 --> 10:57.622
That really was transcendent.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.691
