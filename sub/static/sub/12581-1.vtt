DALE:
Now that's one heck

00:38.298 --> 00:39.822
of a shoetree,
Hank.

00:39.867 --> 00:42.028
Yup, Peggy's birthday
is coming up

00:42.069 --> 00:44.264
and she was hinting that
she wanted something

00:44.304 --> 00:46.465
"for in the bedroom."

00:46.507 --> 00:49.635
(car horn honking)

00:49.677 --> 00:51.406
Bobby, get out of the street!

00:51.445 --> 00:53.936
Hey, get out
of the road!

00:56.417 --> 00:59.284
Bobby, I can't
have you disco
dancing in the alley.

00:59.319 --> 01:00.479
People are going
to think

01:00.521 --> 01:01.681
we didn't
teach you shame.

01:01.722 --> 01:03.087
And I know we have.

01:03.123 --> 01:06.422
(loud bass track)

01:06.460 --> 01:07.688
What is
this garbage?

01:07.728 --> 01:09.218
It's Pimp Franklin

01:09.263 --> 01:11.527
and he doesn't need
your respect, Dad.

01:11.565 --> 01:14.125
He don't pay no man
no mind.

01:14.168 --> 01:20.129
Get in the truck,
son.

01:24.311 --> 01:27.974
When I was our age, we had
these things called songs.

01:28.015 --> 01:29.448
They were two-minute
stories

01:29.483 --> 01:31.144
about people
falling in love

01:31.185 --> 01:32.812
or burning
down Georgia.

01:32.853 --> 01:34.650
But I guess
Hollywood decided

01:34.688 --> 01:36.019
we needed more criminals

01:36.056 --> 01:38.422
yelling
about their lady friend’s...

01:38.459 --> 01:39.517
baby place.

01:39.560 --> 01:41.528
Did you pick out
your new album?

01:43.630 --> 01:45.154
Whoa, red flag,
Bobby.

01:45.199 --> 01:47.599
I have been advised
to listen to this record.

01:47.634 --> 01:50.102
BOBBY:
They put that sticker
on everything.

01:50.137 --> 01:51.798
It's part of the artwork.

01:51.839 --> 01:53.807
It entices.

01:59.880 --> 02:00.847
Excuse me.

02:00.881 --> 02:02.872
I need to use
this parental listening booth

02:02.916 --> 02:04.781
to screen my son's music.

02:04.818 --> 02:08.481
That's a great album.

02:08.521 --> 02:11.889
Put it back.

02:11.925 --> 02:17.886
(raucous rock music)
This one, too.

02:19.967 --> 02:22.936
(techno-pop playing)

02:22.970 --> 02:27.100
The Four Scores... hmm!

02:27.141 --> 02:30.406
Kind of sounds like The Beatles
before they went nuts in India.

02:30.444 --> 02:32.309
It's not the Four Scores, Dad.

02:32.346 --> 02:33.643
It's 4Skore!

to them.

03:14.521 --> 03:16.489
You know, it’s just
good music forth kids.

03:16.523 --> 03:18.787
If your kids like
listening to castrati.

03:18.826 --> 03:21.659
But they are a nice,
wholesome group.

03:21.695 --> 03:24.163
Of castrati, yes.

03:24.198 --> 03:27.258
And we can agree
their music isn't
all that bad.

03:27.301 --> 03:28.268
Maybe even okay.

03:28.302 --> 03:31.499
Okay if you're
a prepubescent girl.

03:31.538 --> 03:33.699
Are you one
of those, Hank, huh?

03:33.740 --> 03:35.298
A prepubescent girl?

03:35.342 --> 03:39.210
Would a prepubescent girl
be able to kick your ass?

03:39.246 --> 03:40.213
Probably.

03:40.247 --> 03:43.705
Dad, 4Skorejust released
a block of tickets

03:43.750 --> 03:44.910
for their show
in Houston.

03:44.952 --> 03:46.920
But I thought they were
all sold out.

03:46.954 --> 03:47.921
That’s just so... wow.

03:47.955 --> 03:53.916
I... I'm just so happy
for you and your friends.

03:58.432 --> 03:59.399
Hey, Connie.

03:59.433 --> 04:00.764
Hey, blonde girl.

04:00.801 --> 04:02.598
This is Jordan,
my study buddy

04:02.636 --> 04:04.604
from the Frontier
Learning Center.

04:04.638 --> 04:05.605
And this is Bobby.

04:05.639 --> 04:08.267
It's nice to meet
you, Jordan.

04:08.308 --> 04:10.367
Sorry. I just got my braces.

04:10.410 --> 04:12.275
I'm still a little jumpy.

04:12.312 --> 04:14.872
I already got smacked
in the lip with a volleyball.

04:14.915 --> 04:16.882
I got stitches.
Do you want to see?

04:16.916 --> 04:17.884
Yes, I do.

04:17.918 --> 04:21.547
That's disgusting.

04:21.588 --> 04:27.151
Okay, ranking
in order of sexiness...

04:27.194 --> 04:28.354
ignoring their
brutal slaughter

04:28.395 --> 04:30.761
of Texans at the Alamo,
I say it goes

04:30.797 --> 04:35.393
Martin Perfecto de Cos,
Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana

04:35.435 --> 04:36.800
and Don Jose Urrrera.

04:36.837 --> 04:39.931
Why don’t we make this
a tad more fun?

04:39.973 --> 04:42.032
Let's rank the men
on our street.

04:42.075 --> 04:45.704
Well, I don't normally
go forth white meat

04:45.746 --> 04:48.010
but number one
is obvious.

04:48.048 --> 04:51.211
That Boomhauer have
one tight little bod.

04:51.251 --> 04:52.616
Well, I think Dale
is second.

04:52.653 --> 04:54.143
Dale?

04:54.187 --> 04:56.314
He is unbelievably limber.

04:56.356 --> 04:57.323
Well, my Khan

04:57.357 --> 04:58.517
definitely
tie for second.

04:58.558 --> 05:02.153
He has big-ass
pompadour

05:02.195 --> 05:08.327
and his stomach
is ripped.

05:08.368 --> 05:10.336
And then I guess
second tier is
Hank and Bill.

05:10.370 --> 05:11.337
¿Escuchame?

05:11.371 --> 05:13.339
You think Hank is on
the same tier as Bill Dauterive?

05:13.373 --> 05:15.341
Well, don't get
all worked up, sug.

05:15.375 --> 05:16.342
We're ranking
by sexy.

05:16.376 --> 05:17.343
Hank's a good man

05:17.377 --> 05:19.345
but he's too uptight
to be sexy.

05:19.379 --> 05:21.347
I will have you know
that in the 20 years

05:21.381 --> 05:22.348
we have been married

05:22.382 --> 05:24.350
Hank has never once
forgotten my birthday

05:24.384 --> 05:27.649
or been late
on a mortgage payment.

05:27.688 --> 05:28.450
(laughing)

05:28.488 --> 05:30.285
Oh, yeah, that's
real sexy, sug.

05:30.324 --> 05:34.283
You obviously didn’t find
Dale real sexy for the 15 years

05:34.328 --> 05:36.353
you were cheating on him
with John Redcorn.

05:36.396 --> 05:38.728
Oh, Lordy! We forgot
John Redcorn.

05:38.765 --> 05:39.754
Whoo!
Oh!

05:39.800 --> 05:40.926
Okay, so it goes

05:40.968 --> 05:42.128
John Redcorn...

05:42.169 --> 05:43.534
Boomhauer,
Khan and Dale.

05:43.570 --> 05:44.559
Then Bill and Hank.

05:44.604 --> 05:46.037
Or Hank and Bill.

05:46.073 --> 05:49.065
It doesn't really matter.
Whichever.

05:51.311 --> 05:53.643
Dad, wait up.

05:53.680 --> 05:56.444
I read a rumor
on the Internet

05:56.483 --> 05:58.417
that Chris
frosted his bangs.

05:58.452 --> 05:59.783
Dang Internet.

05:59.820 --> 06:01.788
They don't care
whose life they ruin.

06:01.822 --> 06:05.258
Dad, I'm thinking about
asking Jordan to dance.

06:05.292 --> 06:06.259
When, how...

06:06.293 --> 06:07.260
what song?

06:07.294 --> 06:09.728
Help me. I'm in over my head.

06:09.763 --> 06:11.731
Well, son, just
look her in the eye

06:11.765 --> 06:13.733
and say, "Would you
care to dance?"

06:13.767 --> 06:15.166
In my experience

06:15.202 --> 06:17.363
women really respond
to formality.

06:17.404 --> 06:21.363
Have your tickets out.

06:21.408 --> 06:22.500
Sir, the parents' section

06:22.542 --> 06:23.736
is in the skybox.

06:23.777 --> 06:27.372
Uh, I came to see the show.

06:27.414 --> 06:29.939

how was the concert?

08:13.887 --> 08:15.218
It was a disaster.

08:15.255 --> 08:16.745
I was fast dancing
with a pretty girl

08:16.790 --> 08:19.384
to one of my favorite songs.

08:19.426 --> 08:22.361
Then Dad ripped us apart.

08:22.395 --> 08:24.124
Hank Hill, are you so uptight

08:24.164 --> 08:26.632
you won't even let
your own son dance with a girl?

08:26.666 --> 08:29.533
They weren't dancing
like you and I dance.

08:29.569 --> 08:31.127
They were enjoying it.

08:31.171 --> 08:32.138
Lord.

08:32.172 --> 08:34.572
Everything now is sex, sex, sex.

08:34.607 --> 08:39.010
It wasn't like this
when I was growing up.

08:39.044 --> 08:42.481
What is going on
with our children?

08:42.515 --> 08:43.482
Yes, exactly.

08:43.517 --> 08:48.386
Do you see the way
the little girls are dressing?

08:48.421 --> 08:51.322
Walking around
in their tiny shirts?

08:51.358 --> 08:53.792
Everything right out
on display.

08:53.827 --> 08:55.761
Where is the mystery?

08:55.795 --> 08:59.993
And we wonder why
men don't respect us.

09:00.033 --> 09:03.025
I can't picture
this horrible, awful dancing.

09:03.069 --> 09:04.036
Maybe I need

09:04.070 --> 09:05.037
for you to show me.

09:05.071 --> 09:06.038
Well, all right

09:06.072 --> 09:08.404
but this is for
informational
purposes only.

09:08.441 --> 09:14.380
What the heck
are they doing?

09:14.414 --> 09:16.746
Then there was
this god-awful hip shaking.

09:16.783 --> 09:20.480
It was like those lizards
we saw on the Discovery Channel.

09:22.689 --> 09:27.058

is now my number-one chore.

09:31.731 --> 09:35.098

09:35.135 --> 09:41.768
with the Teen People, Dad?

09:41.808 --> 09:42.866
I'm making a time capsule.

09:42.909 --> 09:45.707
This box is not to be
opened until you are 16.

09:45.745 --> 09:48.441
Good Lord, what is this
smut you’re listening to?

09:48.481 --> 09:49.379
It's not smut.

09:49.416 --> 09:52.044
It's Radio Disney.

09:57.290 --> 09:59.281
Nudity.

10:01.094 --> 10:03.153
Okay, then.

10:03.196 --> 10:07.155

10:10.704 --> 10:12.467
Yep, kids are growing up

10:12.505 --> 10:13.472
way too fast

10:13.506 --> 10:15.940
and we have no one to blame
but the dairy council.

10:15.976 --> 10:18.467
They're shooting
our milk up with hormones.

10:18.511 --> 10:21.344

and your Shakiras

10:21.381 --> 10:23.349
are their prototypes.

10:27.420 --> 10:29.615
Nice to see you again, Jordan.

10:29.656 --> 10:32.386
Dance with you?

10:32.425 --> 10:35.189
I'd love to.

10:35.228 --> 10:37.958

busy with lawn clippings.

10:44.504 --> 10:45.528

10:45.572 --> 10:46.732
I'm going to show Bobby

10:46.773 --> 10:48.240
that teens
can have fun

10:48.275 --> 10:51.711
without dancing
like sex perverts.

11:06.159 --> 11:07.820
All right, you
are making Bill

11:07.861 --> 11:10.659
look like Pierce Brosnan.

11:15.702 --> 11:18.398
Hi. My name is Howard
Bronsen, Jordan's father.

11:18.438 --> 11:20.406
I was wondering
if you'd mind coming over

11:20.440 --> 11:22.408
so we can discuss
the little problem

11:22.442 --> 11:23.409
that happened the other night.

11:23.443 --> 11:25.240
HANK:
About the other night

11:25.278 --> 11:28.304
Mr. Bronsen and Mrs.
Hilgren-Bronsen.

11:28.348 --> 11:30.145
I take full
responsibility

11:30.183 --> 11:31.480
for what happened.

11:31.518 --> 11:33.748
I'm glad you admit
you over-reacted.

11:33.787 --> 11:34.811
You got a
little paternal

11:34.854 --> 11:36.185
and ruined
the kids' night.

11:36.222 --> 11:39.055
What? I don't think
you understand

11:39.092 --> 11:41.060
what the problem was,
Mr. Bronsen.

11:41.094 --> 11:43.392
Please, call me Mc B.

11:43.430 --> 11:45.398
Would you like
an apple martini?

11:45.432 --> 11:47.730
Oh, well, that
would be lovely.

11:47.767 --> 11:48.734
We used to be

11:48.768 --> 11:50.065
disciplinarians,
but every time

11:50.103 --> 11:52.333
we made some rule
or set some limit

11:52.372 --> 11:54.101
we'd just
start laughing.

11:54.140 --> 11:55.869
I mean, who are
we kidding?

11:55.909 --> 11:58.207
Hair of the dog.

11:58.244 --> 11:59.211
(howls)

11:59.245 --> 12:01.577
Oh, you're
in for a treat.

12:01.614 --> 12:03.206
My son makes
the best'tinis.

12:03.249 --> 12:04.841
Peggy, call the police.

12:04.884 --> 12:07.717
Michael, I'd like you
to meet the Hills.

12:07.754 --> 12:09.483
Call them Hank
and Peggy.

12:09.522 --> 12:12.685
By the way, love the
glasses on you two.

12:12.726 --> 12:13.750
Totally geek chic.

12:13.793 --> 12:14.782
'Sup? Hey, McB.

12:14.828 --> 12:17.991
You missed a hell
of a party last night.

12:18.031 --> 12:19.794
Junior and Ray-Ray
say wazzup.

12:19.833 --> 12:21.198
Ooh, I love Ray-Ray.

12:21.234 --> 12:22.633
Where were you, man?

12:22.669 --> 12:25.103
Hey, someone's got
to work around here.

12:25.138 --> 12:27.606
Sure ain't going to be me.

12:27.640 --> 12:28.607
(laughing)

12:28.641 --> 12:31.769
You know, you really could
wear a shirt like McB's.

12:31.811 --> 12:34.644
We prefer it if
Michael drinks at home

12:34.681 --> 12:36.740
where we know he's safe

12:36.783 --> 12:38.250
and when he gets
really buzzed

12:38.284 --> 12:41.048
you should see him play
Pictionary... it's a riot.

12:41.087 --> 12:43.055
You know, it's
not too late for you

12:43.089 --> 12:45.057
to have this kind
of relationship with Bobby.

12:45.091 --> 12:46.058
Yes, it is.

12:46.092 --> 12:48.253
Hank, all you got to do
is be Bobby's friend.

12:48.294 --> 12:50.819
If not, who is he going to
turn to when he's in trouble?

12:50.864 --> 12:52.422
He won't even
need to turn.

12:52.465 --> 12:54.160
We'll be right
there- bam!

12:54.200 --> 12:55.997
In his face
with a brick wall

12:56.035 --> 12:58.765
of rules, limitations
and discipline.

12:58.805 --> 13:00.170
My parents
were a wall.

13:00.206 --> 13:03.642
I want to be a door that leads
to a world of experiences.

13:03.676 --> 13:05.007
Well, what kind of?

13:05.044 --> 13:05.772
You know, I think

13:05.812 --> 13:07.746
we are all saying
the same thing here.

13:07.781 --> 13:09.078
No, we're not.

13:09.115 --> 13:10.878
Nothing they say
makes any sense.

13:10.917 --> 13:12.748
Look, the kids
really like each other.

13:12.786 --> 13:15.254
I know. Why don't
we all take them out.

13:15.288 --> 13:16.619
Together.

13:16.656 --> 13:17.554
Hey, there's
a great...

13:17.590 --> 13:19.080
I'm picking the place.

13:19.125 --> 13:21.650
(player piano tinkling)

13:24.431 --> 13:26.399
(laughing)

13:29.602 --> 13:30.660
(sighs)

13:30.703 --> 13:31.897
This place is so uncool.

13:31.938 --> 13:37.740
Jan and Tad freaking
Shaw. Get down.

13:37.777 --> 13:39.244
Nancy? McB?

13:39.279 --> 13:43.215
What are you doing
in an ice cream parlor?

13:43.249 --> 13:44.307
I mean,
we’re just here

13:44.350 --> 13:45.874
so Tad can
use the toilet.

13:45.919 --> 13:46.977
Go ahead, honey.

13:47.020 --> 13:48.385
Our kids are
on a date.

13:48.421 --> 13:49.752
Were chaperoning.

13:49.789 --> 13:51.620
Chaperoning.

13:51.658 --> 13:53.387
Nice job, Ronald Reagan.

13:53.426 --> 13:55.018
Hey, don't call me that.

13:55.061 --> 13:56.824
Yeah, don't call him that.

13:56.863 --> 13:58.694
(snickers):
Oh, this must be

13:58.731 --> 14:00.665
so humiliating for Jordan.

14:00.700 --> 14:03.134
My Serena is getting ready
for her limo ride

14:03.169 --> 14:06.161
with her high school
friends. Sophomores.

14:06.206 --> 14:08.174
We were saving up to
rent Jordan a limo

14:08.208 --> 14:09.175
for her birthday,

14:09.209 --> 14:12.838
but she thought it
was a little played out.

14:12.879 --> 14:13.846
She wants a slumber party.

14:13.880 --> 14:14.847
A slumber party.

14:14.881 --> 14:16.007
Good old-fashioned favorite.

14:16.049 --> 14:19.815
With all the girls
and boys in her class.

14:19.853 --> 14:21.150
That's very progressive.

14:21.187 --> 14:23.348
I think maybe
we'll let Serena go.

14:23.389 --> 14:26.654
Well, that
was so exciting.

14:26.693 --> 14:29.127
I did not know
what was going to come next.

14:29.162 --> 14:30.129
I know Jordan
would love it

14:30.163 --> 14:32.131
if Bobby could come
to her slumber party.

14:32.165 --> 14:33.291
We'll be serving tapas.

14:33.333 --> 14:39.294
No. No got dang way is
he going to that party.

14:41.641 --> 14:44.474
Oh, come on, Hank.

14:44.511 --> 14:45.773
The Bronsens
will be there

14:45.812 --> 14:47.109
and this is Bobby's chance

14:47.146 --> 14:49.614
to hang outwith the cool kids
from the Learning Center.

14:49.649 --> 14:52.015
It would be more like
an overnight study session.

14:52.051 --> 14:53.211
Nice one, Mom.

14:53.253 --> 14:54.413
No.

14:54.454 --> 14:56.615
(disgusted snarl)

14:56.656 --> 14:59.250
Did you even see how cool
those other parents were? Huh?

14:59.292 --> 15:01.886
They looked
like Chandler and Monica

15:01.928 --> 15:02.986
and look at us.

15:03.029 --> 15:05.190
Andy Griffith
and Aunt freaking Bee!

15:05.231 --> 15:06.630
And it's all your fault.

15:06.666 --> 15:08.634
I cannot believe
you're not letting him go.

15:08.668 --> 15:10.659
We never get to have
any fun when you're around!

15:10.703 --> 15:11.670
We hate you!

15:11.704 --> 15:12.671
Yeah.

15:12.705 --> 15:16.505
BOBBY:
Happy birthday, Jordan.

15:16.543 --> 15:18.511
I'm sorry I can't come
to your party

15:18.545 --> 15:20.979
but you know how
it is with parents.

15:21.014 --> 15:25.713
Oh, wait... you don't,
'cause yours are fun.

15:25.752 --> 15:26.719
Bye.

15:26.753 --> 15:28.220
Yeah, I treat you so bad

15:28.254 --> 15:29.585
with all the food I give you

15:29.622 --> 15:33.456
and the roof I put
over your head so nicely.

15:33.493 --> 15:35.256
I wish I could
drive you, Bobby

15:35.295 --> 15:38.196
but you know, you really don't
need anyone to drive you

15:38.231 --> 15:40.563
since it's only four stops
on the Number Two bus

15:40.600 --> 15:48.200
which leaves at 7:12,
7:18 and 7:40.

15:49.709 --> 15:54.669
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

15:55.381 --> 15:58.839
Boys and girls are sleeping
in the same room?

15:58.885 --> 16:00.375
(doorbell rings)

16:00.420 --> 16:02.285
You got
the little blue ones?

16:02.322 --> 16:03.346
I love those.

16:03.389 --> 16:04.253
Oh, man.

16:04.290 --> 16:05.655
It's Serena Shaw
from Frontier.

16:05.692 --> 16:07.922
Hey, Connie.

16:07.961 --> 16:10.088
Nice necklace.
Wow.

16:10.129 --> 16:12.620
Thanks. You can have it.

16:12.665 --> 16:14.565
And you are...

16:14.601 --> 16:15.863
Bobby Hill.

16:15.902 --> 16:17.665
Oh, Jordan's new friend.

16:17.704 --> 16:19.797
Well, I'll make sure
you and Jordan

16:19.839 --> 16:22.637
have a lot
of fun tonight.

16:22.675 --> 16:24.575
I'm a good kid!

16:24.611 --> 16:25.805
Okay. We're off
to the movies.

16:25.845 --> 16:28.973
Don’t worry, we'll
be back late.

16:29.015 --> 16:32.451
Uh, we'll make sure
to honk

16:32.485 --> 16:35.420
so we don't
interrupt anything.

16:35.455 --> 16:37.719
You're the coolest, McB.

16:37.757 --> 16:40.282
Okay, the game is called
Seven Minutes in Heaven.

16:40.326 --> 16:43.022
The closet will be heaven,
I will be God.

16:43.062 --> 16:45.792
Someone grab a timer.

16:48.001 --> 16:52.734
My God, they're really leaving.

16:52.772 --> 16:56.731
Is there a phone number
where we can reach you?!

17:28.307 --> 17:30.172
How long have
they been in there?

17:30.209 --> 17:31.608
Four minutes.

17:31.644 --> 17:33.441
I hope they have
enough air.

17:33.479 --> 17:35.344
I don't hear
the sounds of ecstasy.

17:35.381 --> 17:39.249
Dude, lick your hand
and spank her!

17:39.285 --> 17:42.015
Do you have enough air?!

17:42.055 --> 17:44.922
I want to go home.

17:44.957 --> 17:46.185
All right, who's next?

17:46.225 --> 17:52.164
Who's ready for some contact?

17:52.198 --> 17:54.860
Interesting, the birthday girl.

17:54.901 --> 17:55.868
Looks like Jordan

17:55.902 --> 17:58.735
is getting her first
birthday present from...

17:58.771 --> 18:01.296
Bobby Hill.

18:01.340 --> 18:03.240
Um...

18:03.276 --> 18:06.939
Bobby and I just
met each other.

18:06.979 --> 18:09.573
If we move too fast,
isn't it going to ruin it?

18:09.615 --> 18:12.243
I mean, we haven't
even talked online yet.

18:12.285 --> 18:15.277
I like him, at least
I think I like him.

18:15.321 --> 18:18.188
I know he can freak
and he likes ice cream.

18:18.224 --> 18:20.419
I don't know if that's enough.

18:20.460 --> 18:23.293
Well, you've got seven minutes
to get to know him.

18:23.329 --> 18:26.389
(Serena chuckles)

18:26.432 --> 18:29.492
(making kiss noises)

18:29.535 --> 18:30.433
Bobby

18:30.470 --> 18:34.873
I rented a square dance video

18:34.907 --> 18:41.870
and we're going to watch it
as a family.

18:41.914 --> 18:42.881
Bobby?

18:42.915 --> 18:44.473
You sure have
a lot of coats.

18:44.517 --> 18:47.611
I know! Let's look
in all the pockets.

18:47.653 --> 18:49.086
Come on, Bobby.

18:49.122 --> 18:51.522
We don't have much time.

18:51.557 --> 18:53.718
Do you got any pets?

18:53.760 --> 18:54.749
An old dog.

18:54.794 --> 18:55.954
What's your favorite food?

18:55.995 --> 18:56.984
Pork pockets.

18:57.029 --> 18:58.223
Ham or pepperoni?

18:58.264 --> 18:59.663
Ooh, that's a toughie.

18:59.699 --> 19:00.757
I got to think about it.

19:00.800 --> 19:01.562
Bobby!

19:01.601 --> 19:02.795
Ham!
No, pepperoni.

19:02.835 --> 19:03.699
No! Ham.

19:03.736 --> 19:06.864
There.

19:06.906 --> 19:07.895
I like you.

19:07.940 --> 19:10.408
RAMON:
Throw out
some clothes!

19:10.443 --> 19:11.341
Woo-hoo!

19:11.377 --> 19:12.503
I've got a sock.

19:12.545 --> 19:14.445
That's as far
as I'm willing to go.

19:14.480 --> 19:15.606
KIDS:
Shirt! Shirt!

19:15.648 --> 19:17.275
A sock? Are you crazy?

19:17.316 --> 19:19.147
A sock isn't good enough.

19:19.185 --> 19:24.020
Shirt!
Shirt! Shirt!

19:25.691 --> 19:26.680
(terrified squeal)

19:26.726 --> 19:29.786
Oh, thank God.

19:29.829 --> 19:32.161
You are busted, mister.

19:32.198 --> 19:33.893
(kids wooing)

19:33.933 --> 19:35.628
I don't know
what you're wooing for.

19:35.668 --> 19:38.831
You're all busted.

19:38.871 --> 19:40.236
Where are the Bronsens?

19:40.273 --> 19:42.036
They went to the movies.

19:42.074 --> 19:44.338
When did your parents
say they were going to be back?

19:44.377 --> 19:46.345
45 minutes.

19:48.447 --> 19:50.074
You guys got a game shelf?

19:50.116 --> 19:53.085
While we're waiting for
your parents to get here

19:53.119 --> 19:55.087
we're going
to play a little game

19:55.121 --> 19:57.089
I used to play
when I was your age.

19:57.123 --> 20:02.254
No way am I playing
Pin the Tail on the Donkey.

20:02.295 --> 20:04.923
This is the saddest party
that I've ever been to.

20:04.964 --> 20:06.932
Well, I think we have
our first contestant.

20:06.966 --> 20:07.933
Hey... no.

20:07.967 --> 20:09.298
Wh-what are you doing?

20:09.335 --> 20:10.063
Wait, listen, uh...

20:10.102 --> 20:16.166
(chuckling)

20:16.209 --> 20:18.803
Wait, where are you guys?

20:18.845 --> 20:20.745
I can't believe
Hank Hill so uptight

20:20.780 --> 20:22.714
he ruin little girl's
birthday party.

20:22.748 --> 20:24.443
CONNIE:
Thank God he showed up
when he did

20:24.483 --> 20:26.075
or I might be stuck
in a closet right now

20:26.118 --> 20:30.646
getting felt up
by Clark Peters.

20:30.690 --> 20:33.557
What? That little
booger-nose creep?

20:33.593 --> 20:36.460
So, Hank really came in here
and took control, huh?

20:36.495 --> 20:37.928
He crack a whip.

20:37.964 --> 20:39.989
He really is sort
of sweet with the kids.

20:40.032 --> 20:41.624
Just like a big
ol' gummi bear.

20:41.667 --> 20:42.634
All right, I'm coming around.

20:42.668 --> 20:44.761
Hank Hill pretty sexy.

20:44.804 --> 20:48.831
Yeah, but not as sexy
as Boomhauer.

20:48.875 --> 20:50.604
Mmm, that Boomhauer.

20:50.643 --> 20:56.604
MR. BRONSEN:
How much longer
do we have to stay?

20:56.649 --> 20:58.617
We can leave as soon
as the blacksmith

20:58.651 --> 20:59.913
finishes my belt buckle.

20:59.952 --> 21:01.886
So, um, in the closet...

21:01.921 --> 21:06.255
I was going to kiss you,
obviously

21:06.292 --> 21:11.889
but my dang dad came in and, uh,
put a damper on my situation.

21:11.931 --> 21:14.331
So I'm just...

21:14.367 --> 21:16.631
Nuh-uh.

21:16.669 --> 21:17.636
None of that.

21:17.670 --> 21:18.637
Yes, sir.

21:18.671 --> 21:24.075
Nope, nope, none of, uh...

21:24.110 --> 21:25.236
well, I guess
that's okay.

21:25.278 --> 21:28.941
Animals!
