00:47.145 --> 00:50.378
For heroism above and
beyond the call of duty...

00:51.115 --> 00:54.848
for successfully infiltrating
the enemy's ranks...

00:56.020 --> 00:58.221
and securing victory
independently...

00:58.222 --> 01:00.954
with cunning and honor...

01:03.528 --> 01:05.793
Captain John Boyd.

01:12.804 --> 01:13.970
Amen.

01:13.971 --> 01:16.168
Amen.

02:07.291 --> 02:09.454
You're no hero, Boyd.

02:10.360 --> 02:13.597
I want you as far from
my company as possible.

02:13.598 --> 02:16.057
I'm sending you to California...

02:16.634 --> 02:18.399
Fort Spencer.

02:18.936 --> 02:21.201
Please, gentlemen, quickly.

02:22.039 --> 02:24.964
I want all of that in the
largest office on the left.

02:25.977 --> 02:28.777
Careful. Don't scratch it.

02:29.714 --> 02:32.742
Come, come, come,
come, come, please.

05:43.274 --> 05:45.775
Aah! Lieutenant Boyd!

05:46.944 --> 05:48.577
Lieutenant Boyd!

05:48.578 --> 05:50.612
Aaah!

05:50.613 --> 05:52.181
Lieutenant Boyd!

05:52.182 --> 05:53.844
Lieutenant Boy...!

06:07.163 --> 06:08.931
Boyd!

06:08.932 --> 06:12.100
Boyd!

06:12.101 --> 06:14.803
Help me!

06:14.804 --> 06:16.939
Help me, Boyd!

06:16.940 --> 06:19.107
Boyd!

06:19.108 --> 06:21.271
Captain John Boyd.

06:23.613 --> 06:25.173
War hero, huh?

06:26.115 --> 06:29.051
So, the brass decided
to reward you...

06:29.052 --> 06:33.889
with a little appointment
to the California sun?

06:37.927 --> 06:40.124
Have a walnut, Boyd.

06:40.763 --> 06:43.757
Martha brought them in
fresh from San Miguel.

06:44.968 --> 06:47.669
This is my hobby...

06:47.670 --> 06:50.766
reading in the
original languages...

06:52.108 --> 06:54.772
Well, you know,
languages in general.

06:55.278 --> 06:57.009
It's, uh...

06:58.081 --> 07:00.282
It's tedious, I know...

07:00.283 --> 07:04.710
but, then, this place
thrives on tedium.

07:09.626 --> 07:11.186
So, uh...

07:15.431 --> 07:17.799
you have a hobby, Boyd?

07:18.968 --> 07:20.528
Swimming.

07:22.238 --> 07:23.798
Swimming.

07:24.307 --> 07:26.808
I hope you don't mind hard water.

07:26.809 --> 07:28.369
So...

07:30.013 --> 07:31.641
Fort Spencer.

07:32.482 --> 07:35.884
Uh, the Spanish built
this place as a mission.

07:35.885 --> 07:37.386
We inherited her.

07:37.387 --> 07:38.887
Now we're a way station...

07:38.888 --> 07:41.313
for western travelers on their
way through the Nevadas.

07:41.958 --> 07:43.225
We don't get much traffic...

07:43.226 --> 07:44.760
through these parts
in the winter...

07:44.761 --> 07:46.795
so we maintain only a
skeleton company...

07:46.796 --> 07:49.398
that consists of Private Toffler...

07:49.399 --> 07:51.867
who's our personal
emissary from the Lord...

07:51.868 --> 07:54.736
Major Knox, who never met a
bottle he didn't like...

07:55.104 --> 07:57.940
Private Reich... he's our soldier.

07:57.941 --> 08:00.576
Aaah!

08:00.577 --> 08:02.239
I'd steer clear of him.

08:02.812 --> 08:04.780
And Martha you've met.

08:04.781 --> 08:07.149
Bet you didn't get
a word out of her.

08:07.150 --> 08:09.051
And George, her brother.

08:09.052 --> 08:11.820
They're both locals... sort
of came with the place.

08:11.821 --> 08:14.122
Ha! Ha! Ha!

08:14.123 --> 08:17.356
And then there's Private Cleaves.

08:18.828 --> 08:21.287
The overmedicated Private Cleaves.

08:21.898 --> 08:23.599
And you and I make eight.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.334
Cleaves cooks.

08:25.335 --> 08:28.036
Knox used to be a veterinarian,
so he plays doctor.

08:28.037 --> 08:30.268
My advice to you is don't get sick.

08:30.840 --> 08:34.409
I'd tell you don't eat, but
then most of us have to.

08:34.409 --> 08:35.711
So, with your promotion...

08:35.712 --> 08:37.773
you'd be number three in command.

08:42.418 --> 08:43.977
Toffler's prayer.

08:49.659 --> 08:53.929
O heavenly Father, bless
this to our use, and...

08:53.930 --> 08:56.531
- Amen.
- Amen.

08:56.532 --> 09:00.168
So, did anyone do anything today?

09:09.145 --> 09:11.013
We have a great sense
of camaraderie...

09:11.014 --> 09:13.211
here at Fort Spencer.

09:44.981 --> 09:47.281
How did you get behind
the enemy line?

09:47.884 --> 09:50.309
I froze. I was scared.

09:51.087 --> 09:52.487
Scared?

09:52.488 --> 09:57.926
You froze while the rest of
your unit fought and died?

10:02.432 --> 10:04.026
What did you do then?

10:06.402 --> 10:07.996
I played dead.

10:09.939 --> 10:12.307
But you made it behind enemy lines.

10:14.477 --> 10:16.139
I was buried...

10:19.649 --> 10:21.650
with my commanding officer's...

10:21.651 --> 10:24.042
half-shot-off head in my face...

10:25.855 --> 10:28.123
his blood running down my throat.

10:31.794 --> 10:34.185
So, how did you take
the command post?

10:37.133 --> 10:38.693
Something...

10:40.169 --> 10:42.662
something... had changed.

11:14.637 --> 11:18.173
We're going to promote you, Boyd.
We could shoot you...

11:18.174 --> 11:20.609
but as you single-handedly
captured the enemy command...

11:20.610 --> 11:22.577
it might set a bad precedent.

11:24.046 --> 11:26.681
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:26.682 --> 11:29.284
Last-minute addition to the post.

11:29.285 --> 11:31.312
All right, Cleaves. Let's hear it.

11:32.655 --> 11:35.323
Salt, meat, beans...

11:35.324 --> 11:37.459
coffee, oil...

11:37.460 --> 11:39.528
bacon, flour.

11:39.529 --> 11:43.331
All right. I want you
back in three days.

11:43.332 --> 11:44.800
No loco weed...

11:44.801 --> 11:46.935
no peyote...

11:46.936 --> 11:48.103
no women.

11:48.104 --> 11:49.938
No women.

11:49.939 --> 11:52.136
Martha, keep him out of trouble.

11:53.142 --> 11:55.339
OK. Nice trip.

11:57.680 --> 11:59.347
All right, come on.

11:59.348 --> 12:01.010
Ya!

12:02.318 --> 12:03.552
I'm going to get up...

12:03.553 --> 12:06.221
some salt, meat, beans...

12:06.222 --> 12:08.123
Ioco weed, and women.

12:08.124 --> 12:10.692
- No women.
- I can't get a woman?

12:10.693 --> 12:12.958
Wish you were along for the ride?

12:14.597 --> 12:16.157
Unh!

12:24.307 --> 12:26.436
What did you get the medal for?

12:29.912 --> 12:31.870
Cowardice.

12:34.016 --> 12:38.119
Uh... Knox has got some
excellent bourbon.

12:38.120 --> 12:39.721
It's really fine stuff.

12:39.722 --> 12:43.992
And he just passed
out about... a minute ago.

12:43.993 --> 12:47.162
So, uh... wondering
if you'd like to...

12:47.163 --> 12:48.730
He won't mind?

12:48.731 --> 12:50.860
Probably.

12:51.834 --> 12:53.394
To escape...

12:53.870 --> 12:55.737
in one form or another.

12:59.141 --> 13:00.735
Toffler!

13:01.277 --> 13:03.076
Toffler!

13:05.448 --> 13:07.349
- Uh-huh?
- What are you doing?

13:07.350 --> 13:10.742
Oh, um, it's a religious hymn.

13:11.087 --> 13:13.717
I'm writing a religious hymn.

13:14.423 --> 13:16.024
Ah.

13:16.025 --> 13:19.258
Well, could you find some
inspiration somewhere else?

13:19.729 --> 13:22.563
And could you get us some ice?

13:34.911 --> 13:36.471
Funny thing.

13:37.346 --> 13:39.447
We escape the world...

13:39.448 --> 13:41.349
we come here...

13:41.350 --> 13:44.150
and then we turn right around
and try to escape this place.

13:48.624 --> 13:50.759
Frightening thing about
escape, though...

13:50.760 --> 13:52.821
The chance you might end
up someplace worse.

13:53.229 --> 13:54.828
Hmm.

14:04.571 --> 14:06.405
Reich, go that way.

14:06.406 --> 14:07.966
- Colonel.
- Yeah?

14:10.677 --> 14:12.635
Who are you?

14:13.480 --> 14:16.041
Reich! Reich!

14:17.250 --> 14:18.651
- He's alive.
- Jesus Christ.

14:18.652 --> 14:20.883
Just barely. Let's get him inside.

14:21.688 --> 14:23.389
Uh, we need hot water.

14:23.390 --> 14:25.357
Uh, George, Toffler, hot water!

14:25.358 --> 14:27.326
Lots and lots of hot water!

14:27.327 --> 14:30.729
Reich, try to rouse Knox.
Let's get these rags off.

14:30.730 --> 14:33.462
Let's see if we can
get his blood moving.

14:36.136 --> 14:38.197
Toffler, more water!

14:42.943 --> 14:44.640
I think he'll live.

14:45.879 --> 14:47.837
Easy, easy, easy.

15:00.694 --> 15:03.119
Well, he's warm.

15:03.497 --> 15:06.365
Frostbite didn't seem
to do much damage.

15:07.334 --> 15:10.066
I guess the only thing we
can do is let him rest.

15:11.037 --> 15:13.239
And, uh... pray.

15:13.240 --> 15:15.574
Toffler, your duty.

15:16.176 --> 15:17.736
Good work.

15:28.488 --> 15:32.691
Each one of these is about
one-point-five miles.

15:32.692 --> 15:35.356
Takes about three days
actually, because...

15:36.863 --> 15:38.697
Mm-hmm.

15:38.698 --> 15:41.500
- Mm-hmm!
- Yes? He's up.

15:41.501 --> 15:43.061
Excellent.

15:43.703 --> 15:45.502
He's up. Let's go.

15:46.740 --> 15:49.208
Major... Major Knox?

15:50.744 --> 15:52.304
Major Knox?

15:54.915 --> 15:58.017
Major Knox? Doc? Doc?

15:58.018 --> 15:59.752
- Hmm?
- Doc? Doc?

15:59.753 --> 16:02.054
Doc? Doc?

16:02.055 --> 16:03.589
Aah!

16:03.590 --> 16:05.124
Doc, he's awake.

16:05.125 --> 16:06.525
What? Who?

16:06.526 --> 16:08.861
The man who showed up last night.

16:08.862 --> 16:10.262
He's going to tell us what...

16:10.263 --> 16:12.197
He's going to tell
us what happened.

16:12.198 --> 16:13.365
Doc?

16:17.037 --> 16:18.597
Where, uh...

16:21.308 --> 16:22.868
Where am I?

16:23.209 --> 16:25.444
Fort Spencer, California.

16:25.445 --> 16:27.938
Western Sierra Nevadas.

16:36.389 --> 16:37.949
Excuse me.

16:38.758 --> 16:40.420
I'm sorry.

16:42.262 --> 16:44.152
My name is Colqhoun.

16:46.399 --> 16:48.790
F.W. Colqhoun, servant of God.

16:51.204 --> 16:53.799
How are you feeling, Mr. Colqhoun?

16:54.741 --> 16:56.665
Not bad, considering.

16:57.877 --> 16:59.645
I probably look like death.

16:59.646 --> 17:02.674
Not bad... considering.

17:03.850 --> 17:05.773
How long were you out there?

17:06.653 --> 17:08.417
Three months.

17:09.289 --> 17:10.856
Withoutfood?

17:10.857 --> 17:12.917
Yes.

17:14.394 --> 17:15.594
Toffler, help him.

17:15.595 --> 17:17.155
Good Lord.

17:18.263 --> 17:19.824
Good Lord.

17:20.634 --> 17:22.865
You should have seen
me three months ago.

17:25.605 --> 17:27.606
I was thirty pounds heavier.

17:27.607 --> 17:31.602
I'm sorry, but you did say
no food for three months.

17:33.880 --> 17:35.542
I said...

17:36.282 --> 17:38.984
I said no food. I didn't say
there was nothing to eat.

17:38.985 --> 17:40.647
Do you understand?

17:41.655 --> 17:43.386
Do you understand?

17:45.492 --> 17:47.593
I suppose I owe you
gentlemen a story.

17:47.594 --> 17:49.985
Only if you feel up to it.

17:51.364 --> 17:52.924
Yes.

18:04.177 --> 18:06.442
We left in April.

18:07.947 --> 18:09.712
Six of us in all.

18:11.584 --> 18:15.511
Mr. MacCready and his
wife from Ireland.

18:16.089 --> 18:19.591
Mr. Janus from
Virginia, I believe...

18:19.592 --> 18:22.327
with his servant, Jones.

18:22.328 --> 18:24.855
Myself... I'm from Scotland.

18:27.033 --> 18:28.991
And our guide...

18:31.705 --> 18:35.374
a military man, coincidentally.
Colonel Ives.

18:35.375 --> 18:38.073
I don't think I know him.

18:38.611 --> 18:40.239
The better for you.

18:41.147 --> 18:42.912
A detestable man...

18:44.284 --> 18:46.379
and a most disastrous guide.

18:48.388 --> 18:50.312
He professed to know...

18:50.924 --> 18:54.226
a new, shorter route
through the Nevadas.

18:55.829 --> 18:57.560
Quite a route that was.

18:57.997 --> 19:00.524
Longer than the known one...

19:01.334 --> 19:03.035
and impossible to travel.

19:03.036 --> 19:04.369
Get up there! Get on!

19:04.370 --> 19:07.534
We worked... very, very hard.

19:09.442 --> 19:12.478
By the time of the first snowfall we were
still a hundred miles from this place.

19:12.479 --> 19:14.369
That was November.

19:15.482 --> 19:17.873
Proceeding in the snow was futile.

19:19.285 --> 19:21.016
We took shelter in a cave.

19:21.755 --> 19:24.885
We decided to wait until
the storm had passed.

19:25.625 --> 19:27.822
But the storm did not pass.

19:29.095 --> 19:32.225
The trail soon became impassable...

19:34.467 --> 19:36.664
and we had run out of food.

19:38.171 --> 19:41.005
We ate the oxen...

19:42.675 --> 19:44.474
all the horses...

19:46.713 --> 19:48.705
even my own dog.

19:50.517 --> 19:52.646
And that lasted us about a month.

19:53.987 --> 19:57.754
After that, we turned
to our belts...

19:58.358 --> 20:00.055
shoes...

20:00.360 --> 20:02.594
any roots we could dig up...

20:02.595 --> 20:05.725
but you know there's no
real nourishment in those.

20:08.501 --> 20:10.334
We remained famished.

20:12.705 --> 20:14.273
The day that Jones died...

20:14.274 --> 20:16.938
I was out collecting wood.

20:18.645 --> 20:20.979
He had expired from malnourishment.

20:23.316 --> 20:24.483
And when I returned...

20:24.484 --> 20:26.647
the others were cooking
his legs for dinner.

20:33.059 --> 20:35.450
Would I have stopped
it had I been there?

20:39.465 --> 20:41.332
I don't know.

20:43.169 --> 20:45.036
But I must say...

20:46.806 --> 20:49.367
when I stepped inside that cave...

20:52.745 --> 20:56.581
the smell of meat cooking...

21:01.454 --> 21:03.014
I thanked the Lord.

21:04.724 --> 21:07.092
I thanked the Lord.

21:13.499 --> 21:15.799
And then things got out of hand.

21:17.503 --> 21:19.302
I ate sparingly.

21:21.274 --> 21:23.475
Others did not.

21:23.476 --> 21:27.045
The meat did not last us a week...

21:27.046 --> 21:28.547
and we were soon hungry again.

21:28.548 --> 21:30.813
Only this time, our
hunger was different.

21:32.485 --> 21:34.045
More...

21:35.021 --> 21:36.581
severe...

21:37.824 --> 21:39.384
savage.

21:40.894 --> 21:44.525
And Colonel Ives, particularly,
could not be satisfied.

21:48.768 --> 21:51.804
Janus was the first to be killed.

21:54.974 --> 21:56.671
Then Mr. MacCready.

21:57.376 --> 22:00.006
That left Colonel Ives...

22:00.446 --> 22:02.480
MacCready's wife, and I alone...

22:02.481 --> 22:05.611
and I knew in that company
that my days were numbered.

22:08.187 --> 22:12.853
I'm ashamed to say that I acted
in a most cowardly manner.

22:15.127 --> 22:16.561
It would have been
nobler, I know...

22:16.562 --> 22:20.227
to have stayed and protected
Mrs. MacCready from Ives, but...

22:21.634 --> 22:23.194
I was weak.

22:26.672 --> 22:28.733
I fled.

22:31.677 --> 22:35.547
It was nothing less than pure
providence that I arrived here.

22:35.548 --> 22:37.382
Mrs. MacCready...

22:37.383 --> 22:38.950
is she still there?

22:38.951 --> 22:41.019
And Colonel Ives, as far as I know.

22:41.020 --> 22:43.588
Let's pack up. We've
got to go up there.

22:43.589 --> 22:45.089
We've got to go. It's our job.

22:45.090 --> 22:47.822
- Why go?
- It's our job!

22:49.361 --> 22:51.396
Here's you.

22:51.397 --> 22:52.564
Here's Toffler.

22:52.565 --> 22:54.766
Reich has got his own rifle.

22:54.767 --> 22:56.468
I've got my pistol.

22:56.469 --> 22:59.270
I think the cave's three or
four days' march from here.

22:59.271 --> 23:00.705
What is it, George?

23:00.706 --> 23:02.505
What?

23:05.177 --> 23:06.344
Weendigo.

23:06.345 --> 23:07.846
Weendigo.

23:07.847 --> 23:09.814
Weendigo.

23:15.454 --> 23:18.345
It's an old Indian
myth from the north.

23:23.162 --> 23:26.631
A man eats another's flesh.

23:26.632 --> 23:28.499
It's usually an enemy.

23:32.705 --> 23:35.106
And he, um, takes...

23:35.107 --> 23:36.574
no, steals...

23:36.575 --> 23:40.172
his strength, essence, his spirit.

23:43.749 --> 23:48.152
And his hunger becomes craven...

23:48.153 --> 23:50.384
insatiable.

23:54.493 --> 23:57.020
And the more he eats,
the more he wants to.

23:59.198 --> 24:02.100
The more he eats, the
stronger he becomes.

24:02.101 --> 24:05.766
George, people don't
still do that, do they?

24:14.113 --> 24:18.574
White man eats the body of
Jesus Christ every Sunday.

24:23.622 --> 24:25.423
Time!

24:25.424 --> 24:29.260
Major Knox, we're leaving now. You're
going to be in charge until I return.

24:29.261 --> 24:33.765
Here's the key to the arsenal. Martha
and Cleaves will be back in a few days.

24:37.403 --> 24:40.171
Too much bourbon in his bourbon.

24:40.172 --> 24:41.732
Will he be all right?

24:42.908 --> 24:44.605
Yeah, he'll be fine.

24:47.613 --> 24:49.314
Mr. Colqhoun...

24:49.315 --> 24:51.876
uh... getting dressed?

24:52.551 --> 24:53.918
I'm coming with you.

24:53.919 --> 24:57.956
I must come with you. You don't stand
a chance of finding her without me.

24:57.957 --> 25:01.125
Well, you're right. You're a
good man. Thank you.

25:09.234 --> 25:10.768
- Colonel Hart.
- Huh?

25:10.769 --> 25:12.500
- Colonel Hart.
- What?

25:13.606 --> 25:16.474
Oh, thank you, thank you.

25:16.475 --> 25:18.274
I need that.

25:21.847 --> 25:23.581
- Colonel Hart.
- Huh?

25:23.582 --> 25:25.483
Where's my other glasses?

25:25.484 --> 25:27.018
Holy Jesus.

25:27.019 --> 25:28.579
Sorry.

25:50.409 --> 25:52.810
O Lord

25:52.811 --> 25:56.648
What great reward

25:56.649 --> 25:58.549
Can you

25:58.550 --> 26:01.819
Afford

26:01.820 --> 26:06.520
A loy... a loyal ser-servant

26:07.693 --> 26:15.366
Servant... servant...
lervant... dervant...

26:15.367 --> 26:16.961
Fervent.

26:25.244 --> 26:30.014
Who entrusts in you

26:30.015 --> 26:34.452
Your faith so fervent

26:34.453 --> 26:36.184
Fervent.

26:37.923 --> 26:41.588
Wow, it's brilliant out here.

26:46.365 --> 26:48.062
Watch out there.

26:48.967 --> 26:51.358
Ow, drat!

27:24.703 --> 27:26.370
Bourbon break.

27:26.371 --> 27:28.261
Rest stop.

27:29.875 --> 27:31.435
Want some?

27:32.444 --> 27:33.611
Colqhoun?

27:33.612 --> 27:35.502
Reich?

27:41.386 --> 27:43.276
Mr. Colqhoun.

27:44.757 --> 27:48.991
You... you said that
when you ate the man...

27:50.429 --> 27:53.127
Do... do you mind if I ask?

27:55.234 --> 27:57.401
You said that afterwards
your hunger was different...

27:57.402 --> 27:59.337
that you felt wanton.

27:59.338 --> 28:01.296
Yes.

28:02.107 --> 28:05.374
Did you feel at all
physically changed?

28:06.345 --> 28:08.012
Stronger?

28:08.013 --> 28:11.814
I seem to remember
something like that.

28:13.185 --> 28:14.745
A certain...

28:15.988 --> 28:17.650
virility.

28:18.023 --> 28:19.583
Why do you ask?

28:20.292 --> 28:21.459
Hey!

28:21.460 --> 28:23.461
Look, look, look! Look! Hey!

28:23.462 --> 28:24.695
It's a bone!

28:24.696 --> 28:26.364
It's a bone.

28:26.365 --> 28:28.596
Whoa!

28:31.937 --> 28:33.929
No, no, no!

28:50.055 --> 28:51.615
He's all right!

28:53.792 --> 28:55.459
Are you? You all right?

28:55.460 --> 28:57.259
Mm-hmm.

29:09.174 --> 29:12.407
I would very much appreciate
some of that bourbon now.

29:18.851 --> 29:20.218
Bourbon now!

29:20.219 --> 29:22.109
Boyd!

29:25.624 --> 29:27.859
Would you administer
some of this to Toffler?

29:27.860 --> 29:29.420
Thank you.

29:42.307 --> 29:45.867
War hero, afraid of
the sight of blood?

29:54.216 --> 29:55.913
What? What? What?

29:57.586 --> 29:59.387
What is it? What is it?

29:59.388 --> 30:01.856
What is it? What is it?

30:01.857 --> 30:03.591
Wake up! Wake up!

30:03.592 --> 30:05.960
Wake up!

30:06.595 --> 30:08.029
What's the matter?

30:08.030 --> 30:09.897
Wake up, wake up.

30:11.200 --> 30:13.090
Are you all right? You all right?

30:13.903 --> 30:15.904
He was licking me.

30:15.905 --> 30:19.274
- What?
- He was... he was licking me.

30:19.275 --> 30:21.506
No.

30:22.311 --> 30:24.804
He was licking me!

30:25.481 --> 30:28.179
- Reich!
- Yes! Yes!

30:28.817 --> 30:32.020
Reich, rebandage Toffler's wounds.

30:32.021 --> 30:33.187
Mr. Colqhoun?

30:33.188 --> 30:35.456
- Yes?
- You come outside.

30:35.457 --> 30:37.191
Outside! You sleep outside!

30:37.192 --> 30:39.193
Boyd, you, too.

30:39.194 --> 30:41.892
- Stay there.
- Sick man outside!

30:43.265 --> 30:45.767
- Colonel Hart, I can explain.
- Explain!

30:45.768 --> 30:47.201
Um...

30:47.202 --> 30:49.604
It's not what you think.

30:49.605 --> 30:53.107
I... I was having a nightmare.

30:53.108 --> 30:55.143
I was having a nightmare.

30:55.144 --> 30:57.946
That young man screamed,
I awoke, I was on top of him...

30:57.947 --> 31:00.248
my lips were on his wound.

31:00.249 --> 31:03.447
Oh, Jesus Christ, I'm sorry.

31:03.986 --> 31:06.888
Please, restrain me.
Restrain me, Colonel Hart.

31:06.889 --> 31:10.758
I can't be trusted.
Please. I insist.

31:10.759 --> 31:12.319
I insist.

31:27.910 --> 31:29.902
Mr. Colqhoun.

31:35.951 --> 31:37.511
Weendigo.

32:08.951 --> 32:11.046
I take it that's the cave.

32:12.154 --> 32:13.714
- Yeah.
- That's it.

32:14.323 --> 32:15.917
All right.

32:17.226 --> 32:19.787
George, come on.

32:31.907 --> 32:33.875
No, please!

32:33.876 --> 32:35.436
No, please!

32:38.914 --> 32:40.081
No!

32:40.082 --> 32:41.416
No, please!

32:41.417 --> 32:43.284
No, please!

32:43.285 --> 32:44.452
Flank on the left.

32:44.453 --> 32:46.421
No, please! No, no!

32:52.194 --> 32:53.754
Please!

32:54.596 --> 32:57.198
Please, I don't want to go! Please!

32:57.199 --> 32:59.260
Boyd.

33:07.976 --> 33:09.866
They'll kill me!

33:15.050 --> 33:16.284
Please.

33:16.285 --> 33:17.719
Please.

33:17.720 --> 33:18.886
Mrs. MacCready!

33:20.055 --> 33:22.256
Please, please.
They're going to kill me.

33:22.257 --> 33:24.147
Shut up!

33:25.994 --> 33:27.161
Colonel Ives!

33:35.804 --> 33:37.171
Reich!

33:37.172 --> 33:38.773
Reich, break out the lantern.

33:38.774 --> 33:42.575
George, Toffler, stand
guard where you are.

33:43.278 --> 33:44.838
Here.

33:46.048 --> 33:48.182
You're going to have
to go in with Reich.

33:48.183 --> 33:50.418
I'm sorry, but I need
an officer in there.

33:50.419 --> 33:51.979
Here.

34:00.929 --> 34:03.058
Just stay the hell out
of my way, all right?

34:23.252 --> 34:25.516
She's not here, we go
back, right, Colonel?

34:28.190 --> 34:30.080
We go back?

34:30.958 --> 34:33.259
We go all the way back.

35:24.379 --> 35:25.880
Well, well.

35:25.881 --> 35:28.181
Blood.

35:39.394 --> 35:41.284
Boyd.

35:46.435 --> 35:47.995
What are you doing?

35:48.904 --> 35:50.498
Oh, I'm sorry.

35:51.139 --> 35:54.804
After you, Captain.

36:07.055 --> 36:08.256
Captain.

36:08.257 --> 36:09.957
Sorry.

36:09.958 --> 36:11.848
Thank you.

36:36.785 --> 36:38.345
Mr. Colqhoun!

36:43.325 --> 36:45.192
Mr. Colqhoun!

36:49.398 --> 36:50.765
He's spooked.

36:50.766 --> 36:52.793
He's spooking me.

36:57.906 --> 36:59.073
Reich!

37:00.709 --> 37:02.944
- Boyd!
- Reich?

37:02.945 --> 37:05.006
Reich, the colonel's calling us.

37:22.464 --> 37:24.354
Reich!

37:30.539 --> 37:32.600
Jesus!

37:35.911 --> 37:37.712
Oh, God.

37:37.713 --> 37:40.104
One, two, three, four, five.

37:46.052 --> 37:48.253
How many did he say was
in the party? Six, right?

37:48.254 --> 37:50.451
Why?

37:51.390 --> 37:53.621
Who's this?

37:56.062 --> 37:57.690
Ives. Oh, Jesus.

38:00.833 --> 38:02.860
It's a trap!

38:10.543 --> 38:12.410
Boyd!

38:21.087 --> 38:22.647
He killed everyone.

38:23.856 --> 38:25.848
Colqhoun killed everyone!

38:27.793 --> 38:29.820
Colonel Hart!

38:33.366 --> 38:35.427
Kill him!

38:44.544 --> 38:46.275
Reich!

39:14.941 --> 39:16.408
Ungh!

39:16.409 --> 39:18.071
Ahh!

39:52.278 --> 39:54.441
That's so annoying!

40:08.227 --> 40:09.787
Run!

40:12.999 --> 40:14.833
Run, run, run.

40:14.834 --> 40:16.234
Run. Run!

40:16.235 --> 40:17.902
Colonel Hart!

40:17.903 --> 40:19.571
Col...

40:19.572 --> 40:21.462
Oh, Jesus Christ.

40:25.411 --> 40:26.578
Oh, God.

40:26.579 --> 40:28.179
He got George.

40:28.180 --> 40:30.315
- Sir.
- Toffler.

40:30.316 --> 40:31.483
Where's Toffler?

40:31.484 --> 40:33.685
Toffler!

40:36.922 --> 40:38.789
There he is. Let's go, come on.

40:39.859 --> 40:42.093
Go. Get him.

40:42.094 --> 40:44.329
- Boyd!
- Reich!

40:44.330 --> 40:46.027
You can't help him!

40:47.133 --> 40:49.167
He's dead, soldier! Now let's move!

40:49.168 --> 40:51.126
Boyd!

41:22.902 --> 41:24.462
Shh!

41:51.530 --> 41:53.955
Die!

42:11.383 --> 42:12.943
Ugh!

42:22.394 --> 42:23.762
You loaded?

42:23.763 --> 42:25.755
Of course.

42:26.132 --> 42:27.692
Let's go kill that bastard.

42:56.862 --> 42:58.596
Come on, move!

42:58.597 --> 43:00.555
Move!

43:17.249 --> 43:19.446
Reich. Reich.

43:20.352 --> 43:22.220
I'm going to go back.

43:22.221 --> 43:23.781
I'm going to go back.

43:24.824 --> 43:26.384
Find him.

44:02.761 --> 44:04.651
Jesus Christ.

44:12.271 --> 44:14.639
Oh!

44:29.488 --> 44:31.116
Come here.

44:40.332 --> 44:41.994
Get away from me.

44:43.235 --> 44:45.227
Get away from me!

45:05.024 --> 45:07.756
Whoa!

46:58.036 --> 47:00.063
Ohh!

50:03.388 --> 50:04.554
You cold, Reich?

50:04.555 --> 50:06.990
Mind if I take your coat?

50:06.991 --> 50:08.983
I'm freezing.

50:24.442 --> 50:26.332
Nice.

50:27.912 --> 50:29.079
Oh.

50:44.963 --> 50:47.024
What do you think, Major?

50:49.767 --> 50:51.657
Should we stay here?

50:54.439 --> 50:56.830
Or t-take the hill?

51:00.411 --> 51:02.904
I need you to tell me what to do.

51:07.385 --> 51:09.218
I need...

51:09.821 --> 51:12.246
I need you to tell me what to do.

51:16.227 --> 51:17.889
Tell me what to do.

51:18.396 --> 51:20.163
Oh, God.

51:22.066 --> 51:23.626
Oh.

51:43.921 --> 51:47.424
God damn you. God damn
you, you're dead.

51:47.425 --> 51:48.925
You're dead.

51:48.926 --> 51:50.816
You're safe now.

51:51.662 --> 51:53.256
You're safe now.

53:53.917 --> 53:55.477
Boyd?

53:56.086 --> 53:58.681
Martha, Knox, it's Boyd!

54:06.363 --> 54:09.288
All right now, hold on there.

54:56.646 --> 54:58.748
Martha, I need to talk to you.

54:58.749 --> 55:01.583
I need to... Weendigo.

55:01.952 --> 55:03.719
I need to know how to stop it.

55:03.720 --> 55:05.348
I need you to help me.

55:09.025 --> 55:10.860
I'm sorry about your brother...

55:10.861 --> 55:12.361
but I did...

55:12.362 --> 55:14.196
I did not kill him.

55:14.197 --> 55:15.464
I did not kill him.

55:15.465 --> 55:17.867
Martha, how do you st...

55:17.868 --> 55:19.034
How do you stop it?

55:19.035 --> 55:20.766
You don't!

55:21.872 --> 55:25.708
You ever give yourself?

55:25.709 --> 55:27.376
Weendigo eats.

55:27.377 --> 55:30.312
Must eat more, more...
never enough.

55:30.313 --> 55:32.882
He... he takes!

55:32.883 --> 55:35.308
Never, never gives.

55:36.787 --> 55:38.387
You stop weendigo...

55:38.388 --> 55:40.779
you give yourself.

55:41.725 --> 55:43.786
You must die.

55:46.396 --> 55:47.897
There's no sign of anyone.

55:47.898 --> 55:49.899
No sign of a sign of anyone...

55:49.900 --> 55:53.903
not Colonel Hart's rescue
party, not the original party.

55:53.904 --> 55:56.405
- You found the cave?
- There's nothing in there!

55:56.406 --> 55:58.407
There's nothing inside.

55:58.408 --> 56:00.042
There's no blood tracks...

56:00.043 --> 56:02.035
no rope, no bodies.

56:02.612 --> 56:03.779
You don't believe me, sir?

56:03.780 --> 56:07.016
We have four missing soldiers,
Captain, and no bodies.

56:07.017 --> 56:10.252
We need a supportable explanation.

56:10.253 --> 56:12.354
Now, your story, this...

56:12.355 --> 56:13.856
windagee...

56:13.857 --> 56:15.357
is the stuff of campfires.

56:15.358 --> 56:17.026
Would you stop squirming, Lindus?

56:17.027 --> 56:19.486
I know I mispronounced it.
I'm making a point.

56:20.831 --> 56:24.600
My point is, Captain, we
need facts, not myths.

56:24.601 --> 56:26.202
I told you the facts, sir.

56:26.203 --> 56:29.038
Boyd, if you altered
your story now...

56:29.039 --> 56:32.041
it wouldn't be perceived
as retracting a lie...

56:32.042 --> 56:37.446
only... clarifying, um,
a muddled recollection.

56:37.447 --> 56:39.448
The day that we spoke to you...

56:39.449 --> 56:41.517
you were out of your
head with fever.

56:41.518 --> 56:43.586
I was coherent then, I'm
coherent now, sir...

56:43.587 --> 56:44.887
and I distinctly remember...

56:44.888 --> 56:49.080
Perhaps up there in the wilderness
you got separated from your company.

56:49.426 --> 56:52.194
That's why I'm giving you
this second opportunity.

56:52.195 --> 56:54.620
I advise that...

56:56.233 --> 56:58.328
you change your story, Boyd.

57:13.950 --> 57:15.484
Who's that?

57:15.485 --> 57:16.652
New colonel.

57:16.653 --> 57:18.387
A pleasure to meet you, sir.

57:18.388 --> 57:20.255
Why don't we go inside?

57:27.327 --> 57:29.562
- Yes?
- The colonel's here.

57:29.563 --> 57:30.729
Thank you, Lindus.

57:30.730 --> 57:33.132
We've brought in an interim
commanding officer...

57:33.133 --> 57:36.569
until we can appoint a permanent
replacement for Colonel Hart.

57:36.570 --> 57:40.139
Captain, this is Colonel Ives.
Colonel, Captain Boyd.

57:40.140 --> 57:41.700
Captain.

57:43.643 --> 57:45.738
How's the leg?

57:53.220 --> 57:54.787
Lindus?

57:54.788 --> 57:56.815
Let's step outside.

58:01.595 --> 58:04.196
Now, what is the matter
with you, Captain Boyd?

58:04.197 --> 58:06.189
- It's him, sir.
- It's who?

58:06.700 --> 58:09.000
- It's him, sir.
- Who is?

58:10.904 --> 58:12.071
He's Colqhoun, sir.

58:12.072 --> 58:14.206
Colonel Ives is?

58:14.207 --> 58:16.575
He's the one that...
that killed them all, sir.

58:16.576 --> 58:18.177
Are you mad?

58:18.178 --> 58:21.413
Have Major Knox look at him.
Sir, Major Knox was here.

58:21.414 --> 58:22.848
Major Knox.

58:22.849 --> 58:24.984
Have Major Knox look at him, sir.

58:24.985 --> 58:27.580
- Major Knox.
- Major Knox.

58:28.021 --> 58:30.548
He doesn't look
familiar to me, sir.

58:34.127 --> 58:37.096
I do remember the man wore a beard.

58:37.097 --> 58:39.624
But, as I was saying, sir...

58:40.533 --> 58:42.701
I was feeling a bit ill that day.

58:42.702 --> 58:44.770
- You were drunk.
- Captain, please.

58:44.771 --> 58:48.941
Boyd, you say you fired
on this Colqhoun...

58:48.942 --> 58:50.707
struck him in the shoulder.

58:52.112 --> 58:54.546
Well, that would leave a wound,
now, wouldn't it, General?

58:54.547 --> 58:58.651
I presume so. Well, why
don't we check, hmm?

58:58.652 --> 59:01.387
- Colonel Ives.
- General.

59:01.388 --> 59:03.255
Would you humor me a moment?

59:03.256 --> 59:04.957
Of course, sir.

59:04.958 --> 59:06.518
Would you...

59:07.060 --> 59:09.962
Would you take off
your shirt, please...

59:09.963 --> 59:13.992
and show me your shoulder,
please, Colonel?

59:15.735 --> 59:17.466
Please.

59:21.875 --> 59:23.503
Well, I, uh...

59:25.545 --> 59:28.413
My last physical examination was...

59:29.816 --> 59:31.376
was not that long ago.

59:32.052 --> 59:35.512
Surely Major Knox has no
desire to hear me cough.

01:00:11.057 --> 01:00:13.357
The other shoulder,
please, Colonel.

01:00:24.304 --> 01:00:26.194
Thank you, Colonel.

01:00:30.810 --> 01:00:32.370
Not at all.

01:00:33.847 --> 01:00:36.875
- Is there a problem?
- Not with you, Colonel.

01:00:37.984 --> 01:00:40.579
General, we should leave now
in order to avoid the storm.

01:00:48.728 --> 01:00:51.697
Boyd told the general Colonel
Ives killed everyone.

01:00:51.698 --> 01:00:53.465
What?

01:00:53.466 --> 01:00:55.959
He said Colonel Ives was
the man responsible.

01:00:57.737 --> 01:00:59.570
Boyd gone loco.

01:01:02.175 --> 01:01:04.668
I think he's the reason
nobody come back.

01:01:07.514 --> 01:01:09.074
I have to warn you.

01:01:10.216 --> 01:01:12.050
Yeah, Captain?

01:01:12.051 --> 01:01:13.713
Consider yourselves warned.

01:01:15.655 --> 01:01:17.122
Do you need this?

01:01:17.123 --> 01:01:19.124
No, sir.

01:01:19.125 --> 01:01:21.186
Oh, good.

01:01:27.434 --> 01:01:30.325
You're not an eater of
ribs, Colonel Ives?

01:01:31.004 --> 01:01:32.894
No, no, Major. I, uh...

01:01:34.174 --> 01:01:36.667
can never forget it
used to be an animal.

01:01:38.778 --> 01:01:40.946
Sentimental fellow.

01:01:40.947 --> 01:01:43.215
What about you, Captain Boyd?
You don't eat meat?

01:01:43.216 --> 01:01:44.483
Oh, no, he won't.

01:01:44.484 --> 01:01:46.146
Only as a last resort.

01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:48.780
That's a pity.

01:01:59.566 --> 01:02:01.433
Oh...

01:02:13.112 --> 01:02:14.774
Yeah.

01:02:27.827 --> 01:02:29.387
Unh!

01:02:42.275 --> 01:02:44.977
Boyd, no!

01:03:03.162 --> 01:03:05.052
Ha ha ha!

01:03:11.204 --> 01:03:13.196
Damn.

01:03:51.644 --> 01:03:53.511
Ahem.

01:03:54.781 --> 01:03:56.281
Checkmate.

01:03:56.282 --> 01:03:58.884
- Ha ha!
- Aah!

01:03:58.885 --> 01:04:00.650
Huh.

01:04:11.965 --> 01:04:13.525
Well, well...

01:04:14.767 --> 01:04:17.397
It appears a number of
us could use some rest.

01:04:43.361 --> 01:04:45.092
Go on to bed, Boyd.

01:05:21.466 --> 01:05:23.026
Clearing up.

01:05:24.669 --> 01:05:27.264
I found your Private
Reich out there...

01:05:28.406 --> 01:05:30.637
or what was left of him.
You didn't finish.

01:05:30.942 --> 01:05:33.469
Well, I can't blame you.
He was tough.

01:05:35.146 --> 01:05:36.877
But then...

01:05:37.949 --> 01:05:40.249
a good soldier ought to be.

01:05:47.625 --> 01:05:50.220
You know, not that long
ago, I couldn't do that.

01:05:52.663 --> 01:05:55.930
Could barely take a breath
without coughing up blood.

01:05:57.268 --> 01:05:59.067
Tuberculosis.

01:06:00.138 --> 01:06:02.172
That, along with...

01:06:02.173 --> 01:06:04.473
fierce headaches...

01:06:05.576 --> 01:06:07.136
depression...

01:06:08.012 --> 01:06:10.180
suicidal ambition.

01:06:10.181 --> 01:06:13.641
I was in pretty horrible shape.

01:06:15.453 --> 01:06:17.013
In fact...

01:06:17.989 --> 01:06:19.956
I was on my way to a
sanatorium to convalesce...

01:06:19.957 --> 01:06:21.756
more likely to die...

01:06:22.627 --> 01:06:28.488
when en route, this Indian
scout told me a curious story.

01:06:29.667 --> 01:06:33.059
A man eats the flesh of another...

01:06:33.805 --> 01:06:36.036
he steals his strength.

01:06:38.042 --> 01:06:42.606
He absorbs the other man's spirit.

01:06:44.982 --> 01:06:46.872
Well...

01:06:47.652 --> 01:06:49.815
I just had to try.

01:06:51.622 --> 01:06:53.623
Consequently, I ate
the scout first...

01:06:53.624 --> 01:06:55.958
and, you know, he was
absolutely right.

01:06:56.494 --> 01:06:59.062
I grew... stronger.

01:07:01.632 --> 01:07:02.866
Later, through circumstance...

01:07:02.867 --> 01:07:04.935
my wagon train grew
lost in the Rockies.

01:07:04.936 --> 01:07:07.429
- I've heard this story before.
- Mmm.

01:07:10.107 --> 01:07:12.771
I ate five men in three months.

01:07:14.479 --> 01:07:16.039
Tuberculosis?

01:07:16.447 --> 01:07:18.007
Vanished...

01:07:18.683 --> 01:07:20.607
as did the black thoughts.

01:07:21.319 --> 01:07:25.348
I reached Denver that
spring feeling... happy.

01:07:26.190 --> 01:07:28.114
And healthy.

01:07:30.695 --> 01:07:32.824
And virile.

01:07:33.030 --> 01:07:34.590
Did you eat her, too?

01:07:37.001 --> 01:07:38.235
Well, as a matter of fact...

01:07:38.236 --> 01:07:39.503
You're disgusting.

01:07:41.939 --> 01:07:43.373
Here I am, one year later...

01:07:43.374 --> 01:07:45.642
feeling more alive
than ever before.

01:07:45.643 --> 01:07:48.477
And that's what surprises
me about you, Boyd.

01:07:48.913 --> 01:07:50.803
You've tasted it...

01:07:51.582 --> 01:07:53.381
felt its power.

01:07:54.318 --> 01:07:55.878
Yet, you're resisting.

01:07:57.054 --> 01:07:58.522
Why?

01:07:58.523 --> 01:08:00.457
Because it's wrong.

01:08:00.458 --> 01:08:03.418
Ah! Morality...

01:08:04.562 --> 01:08:07.123
the last bastion...

01:08:08.199 --> 01:08:10.133
of a coward.

01:08:10.134 --> 01:08:12.263
Well, I'm sorry.

01:08:12.970 --> 01:08:16.032
I'm sorry. Did I offend you?

01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:26.014
You remember this?

01:08:32.823 --> 01:08:34.747
You smell it?

01:08:36.527 --> 01:08:41.023
Scent always jogs the
memory, don't you think?

01:08:43.367 --> 01:08:45.234
You remember the energy...

01:08:46.804 --> 01:08:50.206
the potency of someone else
coursing through your veins...

01:08:50.207 --> 01:08:52.876
someone brave.

01:08:52.877 --> 01:08:55.609
You know the disappointment
as it dissipates...

01:08:57.113 --> 01:09:01.678
the strength... slipping
from your grasp...

01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:07.157
the growing, killing
need to replenish.

01:09:11.228 --> 01:09:14.064
But I don't have to
remind you of that.

01:09:14.064 --> 01:09:15.863
You're feeling it right now.

01:09:22.807 --> 01:09:24.401
I am going to kill you.

01:09:24.942 --> 01:09:26.343
He die, you die.

01:09:26.344 --> 01:09:29.546
What in heck is going on out here?

01:09:29.546 --> 01:09:31.781
I was on my way to the latrine.
Boyd attacked me.

01:09:31.782 --> 01:09:33.116
He's a liar!

01:09:33.117 --> 01:09:35.018
He's lying!

01:09:35.019 --> 01:09:37.410
Boyd, I'm putting you under arrest.

01:09:39.390 --> 01:09:43.247
Martha, go wake up Cleaves.
Put Boyd under arrest.

01:09:45.363 --> 01:09:47.096
Cleaves?

01:09:47.098 --> 01:09:48.658
Cleaves?

01:09:51.702 --> 01:09:53.203
Cleaves?

01:09:53.203 --> 01:09:54.764
Cleaves!

01:09:58.209 --> 01:09:59.542
You find Cleaves?

01:09:59.543 --> 01:10:00.710
No.

01:10:00.711 --> 01:10:02.479
- You check around outside?
- No.

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:05.280
Well, check around outside, woman!

01:10:21.165 --> 01:10:22.332
Cleaves?

01:10:37.682 --> 01:10:39.242
Cleaves?

01:10:40.985 --> 01:10:42.784
Cleaves?

01:10:49.727 --> 01:10:51.389
Oh... oh!

01:10:58.069 --> 01:11:00.232
Major Knox!

01:11:00.705 --> 01:11:02.265
Major!

01:11:04.508 --> 01:11:06.009
Major!

01:11:06.010 --> 01:11:07.477
What?

01:11:07.478 --> 01:11:10.180
All the horses... dead!

01:11:10.181 --> 01:11:11.946
- What?
- Killed!

01:11:15.519 --> 01:11:17.079
Oh, good gracious.

01:11:41.746 --> 01:11:43.346
Unh!

01:11:43.347 --> 01:11:45.248
That was for Cleaves...

01:11:45.249 --> 01:11:47.412
and this is for my horse.

01:11:51.756 --> 01:11:53.316
Martha...

01:11:54.225 --> 01:11:56.493
Colonel Ives and I have agreed...

01:11:56.494 --> 01:12:00.057
Boyd'll be moved to a military
prison as soon as possible.

01:12:00.564 --> 01:12:03.933
One of us must travel to
San Miguel by foot...

01:12:03.934 --> 01:12:05.969
to get General Slauson.

01:12:05.970 --> 01:12:08.031
Volunteers?

01:12:16.747 --> 01:12:18.546
Safe travel to you, Martha.

01:12:48.678 --> 01:12:50.238
Oh...

01:13:05.294 --> 01:13:06.854
Knox?

01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:09.320
Major Knox?

01:13:11.968 --> 01:13:13.528
Knox!

01:13:20.609 --> 01:13:22.408
Major Knox!

01:13:23.713 --> 01:13:25.580
Major Knox!

01:13:37.660 --> 01:13:39.550
Knox!

01:13:42.531 --> 01:13:45.000
Talk to me. I'd like to
know you're still alive.

01:13:45.001 --> 01:13:47.699
Be quiet, Boyd.

01:13:48.070 --> 01:13:50.097
Good gracious.

01:13:52.675 --> 01:13:54.599
Colonel Ives.

01:13:55.211 --> 01:13:57.178
My sword is missing.

01:13:57.179 --> 01:13:58.346
I'm sorry, Major?

01:13:58.347 --> 01:14:01.773
My sword... in the
parlor, above the fire.

01:14:03.219 --> 01:14:04.779
I haven't seen it.

01:14:08.457 --> 01:14:10.291
What are you cooking?

01:14:10.292 --> 01:14:13.395
It's, uh... stew.

01:14:13.396 --> 01:14:15.230
You need any help?

01:14:15.231 --> 01:14:17.432
No, no, though...

01:14:17.433 --> 01:14:19.198
perhaps later, you might...

01:14:20.102 --> 01:14:21.469
contribute.

01:14:21.470 --> 01:14:23.565
You let me know.

01:14:24.140 --> 01:14:25.306
Ives.

01:14:25.307 --> 01:14:26.708
Ives!

01:14:26.709 --> 01:14:29.344
Yes... Captain?

01:14:29.345 --> 01:14:31.012
When did you do it, Ives?

01:14:31.013 --> 01:14:32.180
Do what, Captain?

01:14:32.181 --> 01:14:33.681
Kill Cleaves and the horses.

01:14:33.682 --> 01:14:35.350
I was watching you the whole time.

01:14:35.351 --> 01:14:38.311
You be quiet about Cleaves
and the horses, Boyd!

01:14:38.954 --> 01:14:41.089
You hear me?

01:14:41.090 --> 01:14:43.424
Or I will put you out again.

01:14:52.868 --> 01:14:55.634
Well, how'd that door come open?

01:15:00.176 --> 01:15:02.203
That'll do it.

01:15:02.812 --> 01:15:04.372
Good gracious.

01:15:08.217 --> 01:15:10.218
Knox?

01:15:13.355 --> 01:15:14.915
Knox!

01:15:21.697 --> 01:15:23.587
Hello, Boyd.

01:15:24.867 --> 01:15:26.034
I hated doing that.

01:15:26.035 --> 01:15:27.869
Unh.

01:15:27.870 --> 01:15:31.940
I told you my regimen had
certain curative powers, Boyd.

01:15:31.941 --> 01:15:33.672
Get him up and around.

01:15:39.715 --> 01:15:42.310
Oh... oh!

01:15:43.385 --> 01:15:46.754
Leg still hurt? Doesn't
have to, you know.

01:15:46.755 --> 01:15:48.452
You killed Cleaves...

01:15:48.891 --> 01:15:50.451
and the horses.

01:15:53.796 --> 01:15:55.356
What happened to you?

01:16:00.436 --> 01:16:02.235
I thought I was dead.

01:16:03.205 --> 01:16:07.803
I remember feeling panic
as my life slipped away.

01:16:09.345 --> 01:16:10.912
It was like drowning in darkness...

01:16:10.913 --> 01:16:13.941
and then... there was nothing.

01:16:15.551 --> 01:16:17.885
And then I woke up...

01:16:18.587 --> 01:16:20.181
and Ives was feeding me.

01:16:20.890 --> 01:16:23.091
By the time I regained my senses...

01:16:23.092 --> 01:16:24.823
there was no turning back.

01:16:25.628 --> 01:16:28.155
I feel terrific.

01:16:29.131 --> 01:16:30.298
So, you're going to kill me?

01:16:30.299 --> 01:16:32.534
No. No.

01:16:32.535 --> 01:16:34.536
It's lonely being a cannibal.

01:16:34.537 --> 01:16:36.700
Tough making friends.

01:16:37.406 --> 01:16:39.364
No, I like you, Boyd.

01:16:40.176 --> 01:16:43.374
We, uh, want to bring
you into the fold.

01:16:44.013 --> 01:16:46.278
You got to eat.

01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:49.851
Finished?

01:16:49.852 --> 01:16:53.788
I'm afraid Major Knox's
penchant for bourbon...

01:16:53.789 --> 01:16:55.588
didn't leave him in the pink.

01:17:01.664 --> 01:17:03.224
You take over.

01:17:07.102 --> 01:17:10.403
Manifest... destiny.

01:17:11.173 --> 01:17:15.076
Westward expansion.

01:17:15.077 --> 01:17:16.967
You know, come April...

01:17:17.947 --> 01:17:19.541
it'll all start again.

01:17:22.084 --> 01:17:23.818
Thousands of gold-hungry
Americans...

01:17:23.819 --> 01:17:26.414
will travel over those mountains...

01:17:27.256 --> 01:17:29.521
on their way to new lives...

01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:34.395
passing right... through...

01:17:34.396 --> 01:17:36.764
here.

01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:39.462
We won't kill...

01:17:40.135 --> 01:17:41.729
indiscriminately.

01:17:44.139 --> 01:17:46.734
No... selectively.

01:17:48.711 --> 01:17:50.271
Good God...

01:17:51.013 --> 01:17:52.714
we don't want to break up families.

01:17:52.715 --> 01:17:54.415
People are not stupid, Ives.

01:17:54.416 --> 01:17:55.850
Really?

01:17:55.851 --> 01:17:57.018
You'll get caught.

01:17:57.019 --> 01:17:59.319
Well, if it's just the two of us...

01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:03.919
jolly old Hart and I.

01:18:06.462 --> 01:18:08.261
You see, that's why we need others.

01:18:10.099 --> 01:18:11.659
You, for one.

01:18:13.369 --> 01:18:15.293
General Slauson.

01:18:16.438 --> 01:18:18.406
Of course, we've no wish
to recruit everyone.

01:18:18.407 --> 01:18:20.672
We've enough mouths
to feed, as it is.

01:18:23.212 --> 01:18:25.170
We just need a home.

01:18:25.414 --> 01:18:26.974
And this country...

01:18:27.816 --> 01:18:29.706
is seeking to be whole.

01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:33.753
Stretching out its arms...

01:18:34.823 --> 01:18:36.884
and consuming all it can.

01:18:40.362 --> 01:18:42.127
And we merely follow.

01:18:43.699 --> 01:18:45.930
Not me.

01:18:49.138 --> 01:18:51.733
You know, it's not courage
to resist me, Boyd.

01:18:53.208 --> 01:18:55.599
It's courage to accept me.

01:18:58.614 --> 01:19:00.709
I mean, you're already one of us.

01:19:02.217 --> 01:19:03.777
Well...

01:19:04.353 --> 01:19:05.913
almost.

01:19:07.256 --> 01:19:08.816
You hunger for it.

01:19:11.860 --> 01:19:13.989
You just won't resign
yourself to it.

01:19:16.065 --> 01:19:19.059
It's not so difficult, really...

01:19:20.736 --> 01:19:22.603
acquiescence.

01:19:24.106 --> 01:19:26.235
It's easy, actually.

01:19:29.878 --> 01:19:33.145
You just... give... in.

01:19:33.816 --> 01:19:35.376
I can't.

01:19:37.386 --> 01:19:39.276
Oh, well.

01:19:41.457 --> 01:19:43.518
Then...

01:19:44.093 --> 01:19:45.460
you die.

01:19:50.966 --> 01:19:53.163
It's all right, it's not fatal.

01:19:54.002 --> 01:19:56.336
Not if you take the
necessary precautions.

01:19:59.875 --> 01:20:03.878
Stew a la Major Knox.

01:20:03.879 --> 01:20:05.546
This will fix you up.

01:20:05.547 --> 01:20:08.249
The old souse was a lot
stronger than he looked.

01:20:08.250 --> 01:20:09.851
A couple of doses of this...

01:20:09.852 --> 01:20:13.119
you'll be right as rain
and twice as strong.

01:20:17.092 --> 01:20:18.652
Well...

01:20:21.630 --> 01:20:23.657
Isn't this civilized?

01:20:28.003 --> 01:20:29.927
Mmm.

01:20:31.673 --> 01:20:33.267
You know...

01:20:34.777 --> 01:20:36.576
Ben Franklin once said...

01:20:37.279 --> 01:20:39.306
"Eat to live...

01:20:39.982 --> 01:20:42.714
"don't live to eat."

01:20:43.986 --> 01:20:46.047
Huh? Huh?

01:20:48.791 --> 01:20:51.192
It's an easy decision, Boyd.

01:20:51.193 --> 01:20:54.426
You can either famine or feast.

01:20:55.164 --> 01:20:56.929
Live or die.

01:21:51.683 --> 01:21:53.243
Bravo.

01:22:00.024 --> 01:22:02.915
Here, chickie, chickie, chickie.

01:22:03.394 --> 01:22:05.386
Run away! Run for your lives!

01:22:05.997 --> 01:22:07.230
Having fun?

01:22:07.231 --> 01:22:08.825
Morning.

01:22:09.534 --> 01:22:11.834
The general's coming, remember?

01:22:25.083 --> 01:22:26.643
Well, you're up.

01:22:26.984 --> 01:22:28.749
Feeling better?

01:22:33.458 --> 01:22:35.525
"Waste not, want not."

01:22:35.526 --> 01:22:37.359
Ben Franklin.

01:22:40.064 --> 01:22:41.624
How's the wound?

01:22:42.166 --> 01:22:43.726
Oh, right as rain.

01:22:50.208 --> 01:22:52.075
Yeah.

01:22:52.677 --> 01:22:54.305
So it is.

01:22:55.513 --> 01:22:57.744
I could use some fresh air.

01:23:02.086 --> 01:23:03.680
Are you to be trusted?

01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:10.920
Of course not.

01:23:40.224 --> 01:23:41.886
Walnut, Boyd?

01:23:51.869 --> 01:23:53.203
All my books are gone.

01:23:53.204 --> 01:23:57.370
I'll miss them. Plato, Aristotle.

01:23:59.076 --> 01:24:02.112
For two millennia, struggling
with the nature of man...

01:24:02.113 --> 01:24:04.214
the ideal society...

01:24:04.215 --> 01:24:06.416
morality.

01:24:06.417 --> 01:24:08.251
Boil it down...

01:24:08.252 --> 01:24:10.387
it's the same issues...

01:24:10.388 --> 01:24:12.813
we can't solve today...

01:24:13.491 --> 01:24:15.959
happiness and how to achieve it.

01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:18.295
Aristotle sought truth,
Colonel, not happiness.

01:24:18.296 --> 01:24:20.288
Truth? Ha!

01:24:21.065 --> 01:24:22.666
I led my whole life
according to what...

01:24:22.667 --> 01:24:25.802
I thought was right and true,
and look where it got me...

01:24:25.803 --> 01:24:27.500
Fort Spencer.

01:24:31.943 --> 01:24:33.503
Come on, General.

01:24:34.679 --> 01:24:36.808
You have to let me go now, sir.

01:24:37.348 --> 01:24:38.942
You know I can't do that.

01:24:39.317 --> 01:24:40.483
Why not?

01:24:40.484 --> 01:24:42.452
We are not alone.

01:24:42.453 --> 01:24:43.687
There's nowhere to go.

01:24:43.688 --> 01:24:45.188
I'm still having nightmares.

01:24:45.189 --> 01:24:46.823
Oh, no, no.

01:24:46.824 --> 01:24:49.593
Reich, Cleaves, Knox.

01:24:49.594 --> 01:24:51.027
No! I don't want to hear this!

01:24:51.028 --> 01:24:53.463
- There's no turning back now!
- I know that, sir.

01:24:53.464 --> 01:24:54.965
Don't you understand?

01:24:54.966 --> 01:24:57.968
All you have to do is kill!

01:24:57.969 --> 01:25:00.667
You have to kill to live!

01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:04.564
You have to kill!

01:25:06.410 --> 01:25:08.300
Uh-huh.

01:25:09.180 --> 01:25:11.343
There we are.

01:25:12.783 --> 01:25:17.051
Breakfast, lunch, reinforcements.

01:25:20.858 --> 01:25:22.486
I'm going to kill him.

01:25:41.145 --> 01:25:42.705
Take the knife.

01:25:45.683 --> 01:25:48.813
You have to do me a
favor before you go.

01:25:50.655 --> 01:25:52.215
You have to kill me.

01:25:54.592 --> 01:25:56.926
I can't live like this anymore.

01:25:58.863 --> 01:26:00.753
Do it.

01:26:03.534 --> 01:26:05.424
Quickly, please.

01:26:17.782 --> 01:26:19.376
Aah!

01:27:50.674 --> 01:27:52.803
Ives!

01:29:13.854 --> 01:29:15.778
Aaaaah!

01:29:26.567 --> 01:29:28.298
Uhh!

01:29:40.047 --> 01:29:41.607
Gaaaah!

01:30:16.383 --> 01:30:17.943
Aaaah!

01:32:42.262 --> 01:32:44.061
Aah!

01:32:55.309 --> 01:32:57.233
That was...

01:32:57.845 --> 01:32:59.405
really...

01:33:00.481 --> 01:33:02.280
sneaky.

01:33:10.691 --> 01:33:12.388
You know...

01:33:13.827 --> 01:33:16.286
if you die first...

01:33:17.464 --> 01:33:20.128
I am definitely going to eat you.

01:33:21.935 --> 01:33:23.495
The question is...

01:33:25.672 --> 01:33:27.630
if I die...
