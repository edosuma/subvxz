WEBVTT

00:00.010 --> 00:02.179
We're looking at about
three months in that cast.

00:02.180 --> 00:04.579
I wish that troublemaker
Garcon Fernandez

00:04.580 --> 00:06.965
never set foot in Springfield Springs.

00:06.966 --> 00:08.989
Although he's a top-notch surgeon,

00:08.990 --> 00:10.449
especially for someone
with an eye patch.

00:10.450 --> 00:12.989
Mm. Mommy? Does everyone
have an evil twin?

00:12.990 --> 00:14.759
Oh, Pat.

00:14.760 --> 00:16.789
If anything, you're the evil
twin and the good Pat is out

00:16.790 --> 00:18.499
making some other family very happy.

00:18.500 --> 00:20.937
I dropped those old magazines
off at the hospital for you.

00:20.938 --> 00:23.314
Switched them out for these newer ones.

00:23.315 --> 00:25.814
"Eight fun projects for
moms and their kids."

00:25.815 --> 00:26.859
Go work on some of these.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.237
And don't come running to me for help.

00:28.238 --> 00:29.560
Also got this.

00:29.570 --> 00:30.739
I ran into a guy from work.

00:30.740 --> 00:32.031
He and his wife just had a baby.

00:32.031 --> 00:33.539
- Idiots.
- I know, right?

00:34.670 --> 00:36.202
You don't smoke cigars.

00:36.203 --> 00:38.449
I don't read "Family Circle" either,

00:38.450 --> 00:40.540
but I'll take one home if it's free.

00:42.167 --> 00:44.849
Guess who else I saw out by
the hospital this morning?

00:44.850 --> 00:45.959
- Hm?
- Joey.

00:45.960 --> 00:47.547
What do you suppose that
chucklehead is up to?

00:47.548 --> 00:49.465
Nothing good if history is prologue.

00:49.466 --> 00:51.199
Geez Louise, Frank.

00:51.200 --> 00:53.019
I should tie a bell around your neck.

00:53.020 --> 00:54.040
Real tight.

00:54.820 --> 00:57.299
So where exactly was Joey this morning?

00:57.300 --> 00:58.640
I think it was the corner of

00:58.650 --> 00:59.680
"mind your own business"

00:59.690 --> 01:01.102
and "nobody likes a snitch."

01:01.103 --> 01:03.040
That sounds like a dicey neighborhood.

01:05.420 --> 01:07.519
I need to borrow the car
and your Polaroid camera.

01:10.120 --> 01:11.129
Fine.

01:11.130 --> 01:13.240
But no more pictures
of the Millers' dog.

01:13.250 --> 01:14.479
He's not a wolf,

01:14.480 --> 01:17.036
and the city is tired of
calling you about it.

01:18.040 --> 01:20.399
That will be one sweet "I told you so"

01:20.400 --> 01:21.920
when Snowball eats a baby.

01:22.790 --> 01:24.959
Normally, I wouldn't consider
doing crafts in my bedroom

01:24.960 --> 01:26.859
for fear of getting
glue on the sheets...

01:26.860 --> 01:28.980
Oh, crud.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.260
... and the resulting
thumping from my mom,

01:31.270 --> 01:33.199
but I had good reason to try

01:33.200 --> 01:35.890
and keep my latest project top secret.

01:35.900 --> 01:38.069
Hi, I'm Jimmy Dreary,

01:38.070 --> 01:41.509
the only fun and talented
member of the Dreary Family.

01:41.510 --> 01:45.449
Nobody in this house is allowed
to be fun or talented!

01:45.450 --> 01:46.840
We can't afford it!

01:46.860 --> 01:49.089
As you can see, the TV
show you are watching now

01:49.090 --> 01:50.549
was not my first attempt

01:50.550 --> 01:52.659
to exploit my family for comedy.

01:52.660 --> 01:54.220
Hey, don't yell at the kid.

01:54.230 --> 01:56.359
I want to do it. I was in the war!

01:56.360 --> 01:58.449
I chose the library for my venue,

01:58.450 --> 02:00.929
figuring no one at home
would find out about it,

02:00.930 --> 02:02.640
given my mom's general
disdain for books...

02:02.650 --> 02:03.959
... and the people who read them.

02:03.960 --> 02:06.789
But my family had a few
rogue intellectuals.

02:06.790 --> 02:10.419
I'm Billiam, and I'm the
dork in the Dreary Family.

02:10.419 --> 02:12.959
- Come on, honey.
- Congratulations on the show.

02:12.960 --> 02:15.209
Or should I say
"unauthorized hatchet-job"?

02:15.210 --> 02:17.270
Okay, please don't tell Mom and Dad.

02:17.280 --> 02:18.679
You guys weren't supposed to see this.

02:18.680 --> 02:19.850
Didn't you consider that

02:19.860 --> 02:22.220
the "weird know-it-all
brother, Billiam,"

02:22.240 --> 02:24.099
who practically lives at the library,

02:24.100 --> 02:25.940
might be at the library?

02:25.950 --> 02:28.119
Hanging out in the...
how did you put it...

02:28.120 --> 02:30.220
"'I am a nerd with no friends' section"?

02:30.900 --> 02:32.900
Read the disclaimer on the
side of my puppet stage.

02:33.800 --> 02:36.299
"Any similarity to
persons living or dead

02:36.300 --> 02:37.400
is purely coincidental

02:37.410 --> 02:39.609
and a tribute to excellent puppetry."

02:39.610 --> 02:41.339
Legally, you can't touch me.

02:45.080 --> 02:47.100
Mike, can I see you a minute?

02:47.110 --> 02:49.840
Unfortunately, my mom found
the glue on my sheet,

02:49.850 --> 02:53.419
but hilariously, her mind went
to a very different place.

02:53.420 --> 02:55.699
I pulled this sheet off of
Timmy's bed this morning,

02:55.700 --> 02:57.159
and... well...

02:57.160 --> 02:58.169
just look at it.

02:58.170 --> 03:00.750
Why? What am I looking at? Oh.

03:00.760 --> 03:03.429
You're looking at
disgusting "boy-activity."

03:03.430 --> 03:04.889
What are we gonna do about this?

03:04.890 --> 03:08.679
I guess put the soap in
and press the buttons?

03:08.680 --> 03:09.980
I don't want to know this about Timmy.

03:09.990 --> 03:11.599
He still has bath toys, for Pete's sake.

03:11.600 --> 03:13.440
Well, now he has a different bath toy.

03:13.450 --> 03:14.719
This is unacceptable, Mike.

03:14.720 --> 03:15.859
You tell him to knock it off.

03:15.860 --> 03:17.899
Well, that's not something I want to do.

03:17.900 --> 03:19.609
Hey, we have eight children.

03:19.610 --> 03:21.060
All we do is stuff we don't want to do.

03:21.070 --> 03:23.700
This was an uncomfortable
area for my dad

03:23.710 --> 03:25.419
because he knew a bit
more about this activity

03:25.420 --> 03:27.449
than he was eager to admit with my mom.

03:27.450 --> 03:29.689
Eddie?

03:29.690 --> 03:31.079
Eddie, where'd you go?

03:31.080 --> 03:32.560
Oh, I'm... I'm in here, Dad.

03:32.570 --> 03:33.820
Just making a phone call.

03:38.290 --> 03:39.499
All right.

03:41.850 --> 03:43.589
I just found two more spots.

03:43.590 --> 03:45.679
Either you say something
to Timmy or I will.

03:45.680 --> 03:47.769
Fine. I'll speak to the boy.

03:47.770 --> 03:49.260
I had to pull my church
blouse out of there

03:49.270 --> 03:51.430
'cause I didn't want it mixed
up with Timmy's business.

03:52.610 --> 03:54.679
He didn't think my mom
could understand because,

03:54.680 --> 03:56.219
in Dad's mind... in all our minds...

03:56.220 --> 03:58.063
she was immune to such impulses.

03:59.360 --> 04:01.449
If my mother ever did indulge,

04:01.450 --> 04:05.319
she did so with an absolute
lack of awareness or guilt.

04:07.000 --> 04:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:17.560 --> 04:19.959
Having seen him steal Dad's cigar,

04:19.959 --> 04:21.048
Frank followed Joey,

04:21.050 --> 04:23.660
eager to catch him in some
cigar-related mischief.

04:23.670 --> 04:25.639
The old people only made Joey's behavior

04:25.640 --> 04:27.169
that much more intriguing.

04:27.170 --> 04:29.140
Another piece of the puzzle.

04:30.140 --> 04:32.769
And nursing homes have lots of puzzles.

04:35.520 --> 04:37.549
One more bite, Mrs. Evans.

04:37.550 --> 04:39.200
Let's make that last
tooth earn its keep.

04:41.320 --> 04:42.619
There's my girl.

04:42.620 --> 04:44.109
Flash me that pearly white.

04:44.110 --> 04:47.119
Here you go.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.269
Be sure to switch off the oxygen

04:48.270 --> 04:49.279
- before you light that up.
- Mm-hmm.

04:49.280 --> 04:50.460
Joey.

04:50.470 --> 04:52.199
It's time for Mr. Franklin's bath.

04:52.200 --> 04:53.759
Well, we can skip the bubbles,

04:53.760 --> 04:56.039
because Mr. Franklin makes his own.

04:58.340 --> 05:01.169
Joey is being kind to old people?

05:01.170 --> 05:02.709
Old people can be a lot of fun,

05:02.710 --> 05:04.560
and they always seem to remember

05:04.570 --> 05:07.259
"when this was all orange groves."

05:07.260 --> 05:08.539
I find it hard to believe

05:08.540 --> 05:10.849
that Joey is suddenly a decent person.

05:10.850 --> 05:12.139
You're being judgmental.

05:12.140 --> 05:14.079
You can't know what's
in somebody's heart.

05:14.080 --> 05:16.439
I once saw two men dressed
as Easter Bunnies

05:16.440 --> 05:18.689
pummel each other outside
of a nursery school.

05:18.690 --> 05:21.340
On the one hand, they
give eggs to children.

05:21.350 --> 05:23.940
On the other hand, tremendous violence.

05:23.950 --> 05:25.790
See?

05:25.800 --> 05:26.819
No.

05:26.820 --> 05:28.869
People and bunnies are complicated.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.219
And when you make them mad,

05:30.220 --> 05:32.119
they can both get racist.

05:38.710 --> 05:40.610
How about you and me going out back?

05:42.150 --> 05:43.509
Play a little catch.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.519
This was a startling
request from my father,

05:45.520 --> 05:48.489
who had never before initiated
any sports activity with me.

05:48.490 --> 05:49.849
Was he dying?

05:49.850 --> 05:52.540
Or worse... was I dying?

05:56.600 --> 05:59.979
Well, look who got her
hair done, you foxy mama.

05:59.980 --> 06:02.149
You'll be short-circuiting
pacemakers tonight.

06:02.150 --> 06:04.119
You smooth-talker.

06:04.120 --> 06:06.570
Oh, Mr. Hollis knows what I mean.

06:06.580 --> 06:08.609
I bet things get pretty
freaky-deaky around here

06:08.610 --> 06:09.949
when the lights go out at 7:00.

06:09.950 --> 06:11.939
Ah, Frank.

06:11.940 --> 06:13.039
Why are you here?

06:13.040 --> 06:14.109
I followed you.

06:14.110 --> 06:15.289
- Because I was...
- Nosy.

06:15.290 --> 06:17.329
A weasel-faced loser.
Have no life of your own.

06:17.330 --> 06:19.219
I'll admit, when I discovered you

06:19.220 --> 06:21.369
volunteering at a nursing home,

06:21.370 --> 06:23.519
I figured you must be up to no good,

06:23.520 --> 06:25.759
like maybe stealing catheters

06:25.760 --> 06:26.919
to sell on the black market.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.029
I knew a guy who bought a
boat selling catheters.

06:29.030 --> 06:31.839
People who need catheters
really need catheters.

06:31.840 --> 06:32.849
They don't haggle.

06:32.850 --> 06:34.629
I then realized, shockingly,

06:34.630 --> 06:36.559
that you were just being
a very nice person.

06:36.560 --> 06:39.569
You try acting like this "cool cat,"

06:39.570 --> 06:42.269
but doing good deeds for others
with no thought of reward...

06:42.270 --> 06:45.179
that is the coolest
thing any cat can do.

06:45.180 --> 06:48.400
It's no use trying to tell
Joey he's a decent person.

06:48.410 --> 06:49.449
He'll just say something mean

06:49.450 --> 06:52.240
to try to cover up what a softy he is.

06:52.260 --> 06:54.699
Angela, this is my
stupid brother, Frank.

06:54.700 --> 06:57.409
I'm going to need a hand giving
Mr. Anders a bath again.

06:57.410 --> 06:58.779
Yesterday, we had to wrestle him

06:58.780 --> 07:00.679
- into the tub.
- Old coot forgot to take

07:00.680 --> 07:01.999
his seizure medication.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.709
Our clothes got soaking wet.

07:03.710 --> 07:04.919
They certainly did.

07:04.920 --> 07:07.439
Angela and I had to lie out in
the sun together to dry off.

07:07.440 --> 07:08.449
I fell asleep for a while.

07:08.450 --> 07:11.069
I know. I watched you.

07:11.070 --> 07:12.549
Just to keep the bees off.

07:12.550 --> 07:13.699
A gentleman.

07:19.740 --> 07:21.709
You're doing a great job there, Angela.

07:21.710 --> 07:24.439
Mrs. Persky, if you're
hanging on, don't.

07:24.440 --> 07:26.319
That is a hairdo for meeting Jesus.

07:26.320 --> 07:28.349
Don't you listen to him, Mrs. Persky.

07:28.350 --> 07:29.619
That's how he flirts.

07:31.500 --> 07:33.159
I knew it.

07:33.160 --> 07:35.189
You're not here to be
a decent human being.

07:35.190 --> 07:37.159
You just want to get your
jollies off with Angela,

07:37.160 --> 07:39.059
who is a million times too good for you.

07:39.060 --> 07:40.529
Of course she is.

07:40.530 --> 07:43.469
Bad girls are fun, but
turning a good girl bad...

07:43.470 --> 07:44.839
that's when they write songs about you.

07:44.840 --> 07:46.460
I wrote a song about you already.

07:46.470 --> 07:48.629
It's called "Joey is Despicable."

07:48.630 --> 07:50.169
I prefer the B-side to that one...

07:50.170 --> 07:51.879
"Joey Makes Out With Angela."

07:51.880 --> 07:53.509
Yesterday, during Mr. Anders' seizure,

07:53.510 --> 07:54.879
I almost made my move.

07:54.880 --> 07:56.349
But then the paramedics showed up

07:56.350 --> 07:57.929
and killed the vibe.

08:03.810 --> 08:05.779
You're a regular Don Drysdale.

08:05.780 --> 08:07.119
Yeah, he was great when he guest-starred

08:07.120 --> 08:08.129
on "The Brady Bunch."

08:08.130 --> 08:10.109
He's got a natural,
nuanced acting style.

08:10.110 --> 08:11.789
That's sort of my stock-in-trade.

08:11.790 --> 08:13.599
I know him more from baseball.

08:13.600 --> 08:15.989
So, listen, your mom was
doing your laundry today...

08:15.990 --> 08:17.769
She finally washed my cape.

08:17.770 --> 08:19.619
I'm down to my rehearsal cape,

08:19.620 --> 08:20.999
and people are starting to comment.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.290
That's not what they're commenting on.

08:26.440 --> 08:27.749
Okay.

08:27.750 --> 08:28.880
Here's the thing.

08:29.740 --> 08:32.510
Your mom told me to talk to you about...

08:33.919 --> 08:35.799
... something I really
don't want to tell you.

08:35.799 --> 08:37.519
I knew it! She shrunk my cape, didn't...

08:37.520 --> 08:41.389
No, it's not about the cape, okay?

08:41.390 --> 08:42.890
But look, she's not gonna let up

08:42.900 --> 08:45.189
until she thinks I talked
to you about this thing,

08:45.190 --> 08:46.959
so we're gonna take this ball

08:46.960 --> 08:48.109
and toss it back and forth

08:48.110 --> 08:50.129
and make it look like
a good conversation.

08:50.130 --> 08:52.219
And then we'll go
inside, and you'll say,

08:52.220 --> 08:54.669
"Great talk, Dad,"
right in front of her.

08:54.670 --> 08:55.739
- You got it?
- Yeah.

08:55.740 --> 08:57.780
So my motivation is we had a great talk.

08:58.840 --> 09:01.240
As long as you say the words.

09:03.120 --> 09:05.830
That was a fantastic
conversation, Father.

09:07.960 --> 09:11.320
I apologize. I kind of
put my own spin on it.

09:13.360 --> 09:16.699
Mr. Avery, you left your teeth
on your breakfast tray.

09:16.700 --> 09:17.729
You'll need them for lunch.

09:17.730 --> 09:19.549
We're having ribs and corn on the cob.

09:19.550 --> 09:21.639
I don't know who's planning these menus.

09:21.640 --> 09:22.719
You'll have to help him

09:22.720 --> 09:23.809
get those chompers in.

09:23.810 --> 09:25.779
And you might want to
pick out the spinach.

09:25.780 --> 09:28.109
Frank, Mrs. Porter needs
her toenails cut.

09:28.110 --> 09:30.849
Ooh, Mrs. Porter's talons.

09:30.850 --> 09:32.269
I noticed they were getting long

09:32.270 --> 09:33.719
when they cut through
her shower slippers.

09:33.720 --> 09:36.519
She's asleep, so now's a good time.

09:36.520 --> 09:37.899
Be careful not to startle her.

09:37.900 --> 09:39.659
Our last volunteer needed stitches.

09:39.660 --> 09:42.289
I'll miss Mrs. Porter's claws.

09:42.290 --> 09:44.819
You can always hear her
when the mailman comes,

09:44.820 --> 09:47.330
tap-tapping across the tile floor.

09:56.600 --> 09:58.169
My dad was having second thoughts

09:58.170 --> 09:59.439
about his "talk" with me.

09:59.440 --> 10:01.169
Sure, he got my mom off his back,

10:01.170 --> 10:02.879
but he hadn't actually told me

10:02.880 --> 10:04.940
to stop doing the thing
I wasn't even doing.

10:04.950 --> 10:06.299
Hey, Timmy,

10:06.300 --> 10:07.389
why is this door closed?

10:07.390 --> 10:09.939
I just wanted a little alone time.

10:09.940 --> 10:12.419
It was then my dad decided
to quit fooling around

10:12.420 --> 10:15.689
and handle things the way he
should have in the first place.

10:15.690 --> 10:18.430
You're asking me to tell
Timmy to stop doing it?

10:19.160 --> 10:21.159
We all know that's not gonna happen.

10:21.160 --> 10:22.559
But he should at least
have the good sense

10:22.560 --> 10:24.489
to be ashamed about it.

10:24.490 --> 10:27.159
I'm not interested in
making him feel shame.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.099
Why not? Shame is good.

10:29.100 --> 10:30.859
It's the only thing
stopping this activity

10:30.860 --> 10:32.369
from taking over his life.

10:32.370 --> 10:34.379
It's hard enough getting
Timmy to do his homework.

10:34.380 --> 10:35.919
I don't want to give him a complex.

10:35.920 --> 10:38.129
Shame does a lot of damage to society.

10:38.130 --> 10:39.719
It's the reason we have society.

10:39.720 --> 10:41.700
If Adam and Eve hadn't felt ashamed,

10:41.710 --> 10:43.099
nobody would've invented pants.

10:43.100 --> 10:45.219
Because we had pants, we needed closets.

10:45.220 --> 10:47.919
Closets led to houses.
Houses led to towns.

10:47.920 --> 10:50.059
Boom, we're on the moon
before the Russians.

10:50.060 --> 10:51.889
Shame also leads to hang-ups.

10:51.890 --> 10:54.019
Our culture's too repressed about sex.

10:54.020 --> 10:55.429
For my money,

10:55.430 --> 10:56.929
we're not repressed enough.

10:56.930 --> 10:58.879
"Sock it to me, baby. I'm on the pill."

10:58.880 --> 11:00.739
Everybody "lettin' it all hang out."

11:00.740 --> 11:02.439
I say tuck it back in.

11:02.440 --> 11:03.909
Especially in front of your mother.

11:03.910 --> 11:05.409
She doesn't need to
know about that stuff.

11:05.410 --> 11:07.249
He does need to be more
considerate of Mom.

11:07.250 --> 11:08.879
Exactly, she's the one who has to deal

11:08.880 --> 11:10.779
with the sheets around here.

11:10.780 --> 11:12.000
And the towels.

11:12.750 --> 11:14.379
And the vacuum cleaner attachments.

11:17.560 --> 11:19.249
You're one of God's creatures.

11:19.250 --> 11:22.080
You're one of God's creatures.

11:22.090 --> 11:23.329
I mean, one of his weirder ones,

11:23.330 --> 11:25.089
like one you'd find in Australia.

11:25.090 --> 11:27.159
I heard you got stuck
with this grody job.

11:27.160 --> 11:28.599
- I don't mind.
- Tell you what.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.099
I'll start on the other hoof.

11:30.100 --> 11:31.939
Oh, poor Mrs. Porter.

11:31.940 --> 11:33.169
Every day, she gets shorter

11:33.170 --> 11:35.269
and these things just get longer.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.279
You are a very good person, Angela.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.289
Aww.

11:39.290 --> 11:40.299
You too, Frank.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.979
Yes, that is my curse.

11:41.980 --> 11:44.110
Which is why I must
tell you something...

11:44.120 --> 11:45.139
... that you won't want to hear

11:45.140 --> 11:46.149
about Joey.

11:46.150 --> 11:48.369
What, that he's trying to jump my bones?

11:48.370 --> 11:49.940
Believe me,

11:49.960 --> 11:52.189
I've known slick operators
like Joey my whole life.

11:52.190 --> 11:53.829
I know what all boys want.

11:53.830 --> 11:54.889
I don't want it.

11:54.890 --> 11:57.199
I mean, until I'm in a
committed relationship

11:57.200 --> 11:58.709
sanctioned by God and my mother.

11:58.710 --> 12:00.799
Maybe we shouldn't be talking like this.

12:00.800 --> 12:03.389
I've overstepped, and I apologize.

12:03.390 --> 12:04.419
No, I'm just worried about

12:04.420 --> 12:05.999
getting a toenail in my mouth.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.119
Trust me,

12:07.120 --> 12:09.389
nothing is going to happen
between me and Joey.

12:09.390 --> 12:11.940
He'll be crushed. May I tell him?

12:12.910 --> 12:14.539
I'd rather you didn't.

12:14.540 --> 12:16.309
It's what's keeping him motivated.

12:16.310 --> 12:18.219
Joey's good with the oldsters here.

12:18.220 --> 12:20.099
They love him... even the
ones who don't think

12:20.100 --> 12:22.079
he's a neighbor boy
from their childhood.

12:22.080 --> 12:24.589
So he is doing a good
deed for no reward.

12:24.590 --> 12:26.259
He just doesn't know it.

12:26.260 --> 12:27.320
Unlike you,

12:27.330 --> 12:28.759
who's here for the right reasons...

12:28.760 --> 12:29.859
... and even wanted to warn me

12:29.860 --> 12:31.629
about your brother.

12:31.630 --> 12:33.859
You are a sweetheart, Frank,

12:33.860 --> 12:35.339
and much more the kind of boy

12:35.340 --> 12:37.760
I'm interested in getting involved with.

12:41.420 --> 12:43.060
Uh...

12:44.320 --> 12:46.979
Uh, I should go get a
broom to sweep these up.

12:46.980 --> 12:49.340
They could pop the tire on a wheelchair.

12:49.760 --> 12:51.690
That's the lavatory!

12:53.580 --> 12:55.160
Hey, little man!

12:55.170 --> 12:56.989
- You got a sec?
- What's up?

12:59.600 --> 13:00.649
Here.

13:00.650 --> 13:03.889
You might want to start
keeping a box by your bed.

13:03.890 --> 13:05.409
In case I have to blow my nose?

13:05.410 --> 13:06.559
Or any other use

13:06.560 --> 13:09.460
you have no reason to
be embarrassed about.

13:10.200 --> 13:11.429
You're right.

13:11.430 --> 13:12.869
I can make tissue ghosts out of these.

13:12.870 --> 13:15.139
Or... whatever else

13:15.140 --> 13:17.219
- you feel the urge to do.
- Oooh!

13:17.220 --> 13:19.239
- Oooh!
- Uh, what is important

13:19.240 --> 13:20.719
- is that you feel good about yourself.
- Whoo-oo!

13:20.720 --> 13:21.879
I feel great about myself.

13:21.880 --> 13:24.039
I made this spooky guy
in, like, two seconds,

13:24.040 --> 13:25.339
and it looks totally real.

13:25.340 --> 13:26.519
- Yeah.
- Oooh!

13:26.520 --> 13:27.760
Timmy, just listen.

13:27.770 --> 13:29.070
- Whoo... oo-oo!
- Timmy... Okay, yeah...

13:29.071 --> 13:30.079
- Okay, Timmy, just...
- Boo!

13:30.080 --> 13:31.770
Cut it out.

13:32.790 --> 13:36.389
Look, I know about your
new secret activity.

13:36.390 --> 13:38.419
- You do?
- Yeah.

13:38.420 --> 13:39.729
Did that rat William tell you?

13:39.730 --> 13:40.829
No.

13:40.830 --> 13:42.199
You've been a little messy with it,

13:42.200 --> 13:44.149
and it's not fair to Mom, who
has to clean up after you.

13:44.150 --> 13:45.839
- Mom knows?
- I don't think so...

13:45.840 --> 13:46.849
- No, no, no.
- ... yet.

13:46.850 --> 13:47.869
Mom can't know.

13:47.870 --> 13:50.329
Well, there's no reason she has to.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.489
But you know about it, and
you're not mad at me?

13:52.490 --> 13:54.570
God, no! It's beautiful and natural.

13:54.580 --> 13:56.079
I did the same thing
when I was your age.

13:56.080 --> 13:58.080
I doubt with the same
level of pageantry.

13:58.100 --> 14:00.919
That's the spirit! Celebrate
yourself, brother.

14:00.920 --> 14:02.709
Just, you know,

14:02.710 --> 14:04.509
do your best to keep it private.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.150
But the whole point is
having an audience.

14:07.090 --> 14:08.179
An audience?

14:08.180 --> 14:09.719
I really feed off their energy.

14:09.720 --> 14:12.079
I got a good reaction when
I did it at the library.

14:12.080 --> 14:14.179
But they insisted I do it quietly

14:14.180 --> 14:15.769
and only in the children's section.

14:15.770 --> 14:17.329
Stop.

14:17.330 --> 14:19.059
What are you talking about?

14:19.060 --> 14:20.149
My puppet show.

14:20.150 --> 14:22.740
And you're right, it is
natural and beautiful.

14:22.750 --> 14:24.230
I'm gonna quote you in my flyer.

14:27.320 --> 14:28.790
What were the toenails like?

14:28.800 --> 14:30.019
Were they like... ?

14:30.020 --> 14:31.739
Pointier, more like Doritos.

14:31.740 --> 14:33.489
Gross.

14:33.490 --> 14:36.319
And then this girl just... kissed me,

14:36.320 --> 14:37.579
bold as you please.

14:37.580 --> 14:39.119
And I don't even know her middle name.

14:39.120 --> 14:40.419
Unreal, Frank!

14:40.420 --> 14:41.629
Your first kiss.

14:41.630 --> 14:43.260
It's not my first kiss.

14:43.270 --> 14:44.689
After her Mediterranean cruise,

14:44.690 --> 14:46.269
Mrs. Strausser and I started doing

14:46.270 --> 14:48.429
this sort of European greeting thing.

14:48.430 --> 14:50.589
Elderly cheek kisses with
your neighbor don't count.

14:50.590 --> 14:52.790
I guess it was my first kiss then.

14:52.800 --> 14:55.559
I'll have to tell my future
wife these lips have a past.

14:55.560 --> 14:56.869
Maybe you'll end up with Angela.

14:56.870 --> 14:58.779
Right, a girl who pounces on me

14:58.780 --> 15:00.009
10 minutes after we meet?

15:00.010 --> 15:01.609
Nice try, Mary Magdalene.

15:01.610 --> 15:03.269
Go peddle your goodies elsewhere.

15:03.270 --> 15:04.719
You said you liked her.

15:04.720 --> 15:05.729
I do.

15:05.730 --> 15:08.749
She's fun, and... and
she's so confident.

15:08.750 --> 15:10.190
But how do you respect a girl

15:10.200 --> 15:12.909
who just goes around
kissing people willy-nilly?

15:12.910 --> 15:15.160
Look...

15:15.170 --> 15:17.029
every person is lots of things...

15:17.030 --> 15:19.039
some good things, some not-so-good,

15:19.040 --> 15:20.759
and sometimes all mixed up.

15:20.760 --> 15:22.159
You don't want to be too quick to judge,

15:22.160 --> 15:23.240
especially yourself.

15:23.260 --> 15:25.569
- Another piece of advice?
- Sure.

15:25.570 --> 15:27.519
Start seeing less of Ol' Lady Strausser.

15:27.520 --> 15:28.699
Let her down easy,

15:28.700 --> 15:30.620
but that's more about her
hip than anything else.

15:34.580 --> 15:36.659
Now that I knew some of my
family were catching on,

15:36.660 --> 15:39.779
I took Lawrence's warning about
not leaving a mess for Mom.

15:47.070 --> 15:48.259
Hey, hon!

15:48.260 --> 15:50.290
The dead raccoon is still in the street

15:50.300 --> 15:52.189
in front of the apartment building.

15:52.190 --> 15:53.779
That's the problem with renters...

15:53.780 --> 15:55.829
no pride of ownership.

15:55.830 --> 15:57.890
I found this Sears
Catalog in Timmy's room,

15:57.900 --> 15:59.460
and look what he did to it.

15:59.470 --> 16:01.499
The pages are all stuck together.

16:01.500 --> 16:03.219
- Oh, boy.
- And for some odd reason,

16:03.220 --> 16:04.869
it's "women's coats."

16:04.870 --> 16:06.719
Well, at that age, it
doesn't take a lot.

16:06.720 --> 16:07.729
What are we supposed to do, Mike?

16:07.730 --> 16:09.339
Get rid of everything
with a woman's picture?

16:09.340 --> 16:10.759
"Hide the Mrs. Butterworth's bottle.

16:10.760 --> 16:11.779
Timmy's on the make."

16:11.780 --> 16:13.099
Well, if they produced a better syrup,

16:13.100 --> 16:14.339
they wouldn't need to sex it up.

16:14.340 --> 16:15.669
The brass of that kid.

16:15.670 --> 16:16.919
And after you gave him that talking-to,

16:16.920 --> 16:18.489
he's still in there, guns a-blazin'.

16:18.490 --> 16:19.859
The thing is...

16:19.860 --> 16:22.559
I didn't really talk to him, Peg.

16:22.560 --> 16:23.790
You were out there throwing a ball

16:23.800 --> 16:24.989
for twenty minutes with that klutz.

16:24.990 --> 16:26.000
You better have talked to him,

16:26.001 --> 16:27.109
'cause that was painful to watch.

16:27.110 --> 16:28.590
I didn't bring it up with him

16:28.600 --> 16:31.149
because I don't really agree with you.

16:31.150 --> 16:33.149
You're saying we have
different opinions on this?

16:33.150 --> 16:34.869
- I am.
- Oh, I guess one of us

16:34.870 --> 16:37.779
wants our kids to grow up to
be solid, tax-paying citizens

16:37.780 --> 16:38.890
when the other one wants them ending up

16:38.900 --> 16:40.499
in a sex-maniac ward at the nuthouse.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.609
Look, if we overreact,

16:41.610 --> 16:44.349
we might give him "a complex," okay?

16:44.350 --> 16:47.579
Look, what Timmy is doing is normal.

16:47.580 --> 16:48.839
Every boy does it.

16:48.840 --> 16:49.940
It's part of being a man.

16:50.900 --> 16:51.919
Do you do it?

16:51.920 --> 16:53.999
No.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.139
Of course not.

16:56.140 --> 16:57.680
But I'm the exception.

16:57.690 --> 16:59.380
And this may come as a shock,

16:59.390 --> 17:01.329
but I'm pretty sure our older boys

17:01.330 --> 17:03.139
are blazin' their guns, as well.

17:03.140 --> 17:05.598
They're doing it, it's part of life,

17:05.599 --> 17:07.059
and, honestly, it's
none of our business.

17:07.060 --> 17:08.419
None of our business?

17:08.420 --> 17:10.229
Are we even raising these kids anymore?

17:10.230 --> 17:11.679
Yeah, but when they cross that line

17:11.680 --> 17:13.770
into stuff that makes
us sick to our stomach,

17:13.780 --> 17:14.949
it's time to give them some privacy.

17:14.950 --> 17:18.378
Or I could just teach our
child some self-control.

17:18.380 --> 17:19.779
Privacy.

17:19.780 --> 17:21.419
Like we're one of those
hoity-toity families

17:21.420 --> 17:23.179
with a lock on the bathroom door.

17:23.180 --> 17:24.789
Check out this microwave

17:24.790 --> 17:26.419
I brought home, kids.

17:26.420 --> 17:30.229
I like it more than I like any of you.

17:30.230 --> 17:31.829
Son, your mom and I

17:31.830 --> 17:34.099
and our open eyes are coming in.

17:34.100 --> 17:36.329
Honestly, there's no way
he's at it again...

17:38.260 --> 17:40.079
One cup detergent, hot
water, regular cycle.

17:40.080 --> 17:41.800
It's your turn.

17:42.470 --> 17:44.870
Hey, can you guys come back later?

17:45.640 --> 17:47.649
I was thinking of taking a nap.

17:47.650 --> 17:50.079
- Oh, God.
- Well, it does make you sleepy, Peg.

17:50.080 --> 17:51.549
- What?
- What are we all talking about?

17:51.550 --> 17:53.179
No, you don't. Get out, and stay out!

17:53.180 --> 17:55.279
- Okay, geez!
- I know what you've been up to.

17:55.280 --> 17:57.199
Mom, I really don't think you do.

17:57.200 --> 17:59.159
Timmy, go ahead, show them
what's under those covers.

17:59.160 --> 18:00.389
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- No, no!

18:00.390 --> 18:01.760
It's not what you guys think. Go ahead.

18:01.770 --> 18:04.860
- There's no reason to hide it.
- Oh, my sweet and gentle Jesus.

18:06.630 --> 18:07.999
Just my puppets.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.999
And sorry, I got some
more glue on the sheets.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.840
You've been in here
playing with puppets?

18:15.240 --> 18:16.369
Honestly,

18:16.370 --> 18:18.700
and after all the fuss you made...

18:21.180 --> 18:23.039
Hi, can I talk to Frank, please?

18:23.040 --> 18:24.109
You can.

18:24.110 --> 18:25.179
But it won't be fun or interesting.

18:25.180 --> 18:26.579
Hey, Frank!

18:26.580 --> 18:27.690
There's a pretty girl here to see you

18:27.700 --> 18:29.149
for no discernible reason.

18:33.960 --> 18:36.489
Then you looked at me
horrified and just ran out.

18:36.490 --> 18:38.319
I'm ready to call that a mistake.

18:38.320 --> 18:40.759
It felt insulting after
Mrs. Porter's toenails

18:40.760 --> 18:41.990
that me kissing you was the thing

18:42.000 --> 18:43.669
that sent you screaming
out of that room.

18:43.670 --> 18:45.779
If you'd be interested in
trying that kiss again,

18:45.780 --> 18:47.159
I promise this time not to cry.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.180
You cried?

18:48.190 --> 18:49.780
What?

18:49.800 --> 18:51.820
No.

18:52.540 --> 18:54.409
Isn't Frank the sly one?

18:54.410 --> 18:56.379
I never pictured him as a lady-killer,

18:56.380 --> 18:58.259
except maybe the kind
you see on the news.

18:58.260 --> 19:00.019
Back away from the window, Peg.

19:00.020 --> 19:02.979
If you think watching Timmy try
to play catch was painful...

19:02.980 --> 19:06.219
We have seen a lot of
horrible things today.

19:06.220 --> 19:07.490
I don't know, maybe you're right

19:07.500 --> 19:08.979
about giving the kids more privacy.

19:08.980 --> 19:11.099
Well, it's not so much
for them as for us.

19:11.100 --> 19:12.879
Well, you should've said
that in the first place.

19:12.880 --> 19:14.269
I'd have been onboard right away.

19:14.270 --> 19:15.439
God.

19:15.440 --> 19:17.859
I feel really bad about the
way that I reacted today.

19:17.860 --> 19:20.059
I can be pretty judgmental about girls,

19:20.060 --> 19:21.169
thanks to my mother.

19:21.170 --> 19:23.829
She set this impossible
standard of excellence.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.019
The mean lady at the door?

19:25.020 --> 19:26.199
Isn't she great?

19:26.200 --> 19:27.560
What you did bugged me so much,

19:27.570 --> 19:28.999
I couldn't just let it go.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.649
I don't like to let that stuff build up.

19:30.650 --> 19:32.129
It might make me do something crazy.

19:32.130 --> 19:33.759
Crazy... like kissing
me again right now,

19:33.760 --> 19:35.129
when I'm totally braced for it?

19:35.130 --> 19:36.479
More like vandalism...

19:36.480 --> 19:38.189
or shoplifting...

19:38.190 --> 19:39.589
or burning my boyfriend's car.

19:39.590 --> 19:40.760
You have a boyfriend?

19:40.770 --> 19:42.159
Ex-boyfriend.

19:42.160 --> 19:44.229
He loved that car.

19:44.230 --> 19:46.059
You should know, Frank,

19:46.060 --> 19:49.459
I don't volunteer at the nursing
home just out of kindness.

19:49.460 --> 19:51.599
It's court ordered for
juvenile offenders.

19:51.600 --> 19:52.809
Juvenile offend...

19:52.810 --> 19:54.739
I'm not judging.

19:54.740 --> 19:56.939
Although it sounds like
there was a judge involved.

19:56.940 --> 19:58.439
I am on a better path now,

19:58.440 --> 19:59.869
but if you can't handle a kiss,

19:59.870 --> 20:02.609
you will definitely freak out
over the rest of the package.

20:02.610 --> 20:03.909
A lot of guys have left me

20:03.910 --> 20:05.449
feeling pretty bad about myself...

20:05.450 --> 20:07.419
A lot of guys?

20:07.420 --> 20:09.579
Not judging. Don't burn my car.

20:09.580 --> 20:11.439
I am not putting myself
through that again.

20:11.440 --> 20:12.499
Goodbye.

20:12.500 --> 20:14.419
Goodbye, Angela.

20:14.420 --> 20:16.259
Hi, Joey.

20:16.260 --> 20:17.420
Angela.

20:19.620 --> 20:21.099
Congrats, man.

20:21.100 --> 20:23.769
Gotta say, I'm impressed.

20:23.770 --> 20:25.119
And not too proud

20:25.120 --> 20:26.759
to extend my hand when
the better man wins.

20:26.760 --> 20:28.169
I blew it.

20:28.170 --> 20:30.059
She told me she's not interested.

20:30.060 --> 20:32.479
And the world makes sense once again.

20:34.850 --> 20:37.150
I keep thinking how we're
gonna have to relive

20:37.160 --> 20:39.739
that filthy milestone
with three more kids.

20:39.740 --> 20:41.019
Four.

20:41.020 --> 20:43.749
Timmy didn't know what the hell
we were talking about today.

20:45.280 --> 20:46.489
Men are animals.

20:56.280 --> 20:58.229
I'm gonna have to go

20:58.230 --> 21:00.050
and put a load in the wash.

21:02.740 --> 21:04.880
That woman is a saint.
