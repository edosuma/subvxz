it's because of texting,

What about Pam?

be my Pam.

gonna get anywhere and
he's gonna blow our sale.

lt's not that huge a sale.

resent this because. . .

help oozing sexuality.

two things?

She just crossed
her arms together.
That's bad.

her breasts together
to make them look bigger.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.916
l think we could.

09:46.836 --> 09:50.463
l don't see how we could
possibly sell these for that
little without losing money.

09:50.548 --> 09:52.048

09:52.133 --> 09:53.341
Okay, well, sometimes,

09:53.426 --> 09:58.638
sometimes it makes financial
sense to lose money, right?
Like, for tax purposes.

09:58.848 --> 10:01.933
Actually, l ran
the numbers on this,
and in this case,

10:02.018 --> 10:03.768
it makes more financial
sense to gain money.

run them again?

flirting with you
to get a better price?

10:07.356 --> 10:08.481
lf she is,
it's working.

10:08.566 --> 10:12.485
Yeah, Michael, here's a trick.
Ask her if she wants a mint.

10:12.945 --> 10:16.781
lf she says no,
then she is not
interested.

10:16.866 --> 10:18.700
She does not like him.

10:18.784 --> 10:23.455
You can flirt with someone
to get what you want and
also be attracted to them.

10:23.539 --> 10:24.914
How do you think
we got together?

10:24.999 --> 10:26.750
'Cause l stopped
by your desk, like,
1 5 times a day.

10:26.834 --> 10:28.627
l was after your money.

10:28.711 --> 10:29.919
Well, the joke was on you.

10:30.004 --> 10:31.379
Yes, it was.

10:32.340 --> 10:33.715
Can you stop
micromanaging?

10:33.841 --> 10:35.634
l know how to do this.
You're yelling. . .
Okay. Okay.

10:35.718 --> 10:36.718
What are you guys doing?

10:36.802 --> 10:38.511
This girl was really rude
to me at the mall,

10:38.596 --> 10:41.473
so l created a fake lM
account from a hot guy
at her high school,

10:41.557 --> 10:42.974
and now l'm trying
to make her anorexic.

10:43.059 --> 10:45.310
Tell her everyone
in homeroom
thinks she's fat.

10:45.394 --> 10:46.394
KELLY: That is so good.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.563
You know, we really
should keep practicing
for this interview.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.106
Oh, that's okay.
Ryan coached me.

10:50.191 --> 10:52.025
Ryan? What does he know?

10:52.109 --> 10:54.152
lt's easy. You just
turn every question
around on them.

10:54.236 --> 10:56.029
Do you think you're
treated differently
because of your race?

10:56.113 --> 10:58.782
Would you ask
that same question
if l was white?

10:58.866 --> 11:00.575
We're so in.
We?

11:01.035 --> 11:03.370
When l become executive,
l'm gonna make Ryan manager.

11:03.454 --> 11:06.289
And then the two of us
are cleaning house.

11:06.916 --> 11:08.917
DWIGHT: Kelly will be
even worse than Darryl.

11:09.251 --> 11:10.377
lf you'd have told
me this morning

11:10.461 --> 11:14.172
that today l'd be creating
a monster capable
of my own destruction,

11:14.256 --> 11:18.176
l'd have thought you were
referring to the bull Mose
and l are trying to reanimate.

11:18.427 --> 11:23.223
"So, corporate approval
of this contract is contingent
upon buyer and seller

11:23.307 --> 11:26.142
"obtaining. . ."
Blah-de-blah-de-blah.

11:26.227 --> 11:29.479
"Boilerplate,
pound of fish."
Just kidding.

11:30.481 --> 11:32.440
Do you like mints?
Yes.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.359
l carry mints
with me sometimes.

11:34.443 --> 11:35.610
Oh, l haven't
tried those.

11:35.695 --> 11:36.695
Ever tried those?
No.

11:36.779 --> 11:37.821
They're good.

11:37.905 --> 11:38.947
You want one?

11:40.199 --> 11:42.033
Sure.
lt's like. . .

11:43.452 --> 11:47.205
"Cool. . . Certified cool."
l like how they
say "certified."

11:48.207 --> 11:51.042
Like there's some
consortium of. . .

11:53.462 --> 11:54.546
Michael !

11:54.630 --> 11:55.797
l'm sorry.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.383
l can't stop myself
from kissing her.

11:58.467 --> 12:02.512
Yeah. Now you know
how l feel sitting next
to those M&M's all day.

12:02.888 --> 12:04.305
Well, why don't you
just move the M&M's?

12:04.390 --> 12:05.807
Why don't you shut up?

12:05.891 --> 12:10.019
Okay. Guys, guys, guys,
just tell me it's not totally
insane to try one more time.

12:10.104 --> 12:11.104
lt is totally insane.

12:11.188 --> 12:13.732
Michael, he's right.
You are turning
into a stalker.

12:13.816 --> 12:15.650
(SlGHlNG) Okay.
What do you think?

12:16.026 --> 12:17.360
l think it's over, man.

12:17.737 --> 12:18.820
Andy?

12:19.655 --> 12:21.156
(GROANlNG)

12:21.240 --> 12:22.282
Okay, some for,
some against.

12:22.366 --> 12:23.408
Nobody's for.

12:23.492 --> 12:24.534
Pam.
Hmm?

12:24.618 --> 12:25.702
What do you think?

12:27.496 --> 12:28.705
l think it's really,
really unlikely.

12:28.789 --> 12:29.789
Okay.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.499
Really unlikely.

12:32.209 --> 12:33.752
But l can't say
that it's impossible.

12:33.836 --> 12:35.044
What?

12:35.212 --> 12:37.213
l'm not saying
she's in love with him,

12:37.298 --> 12:39.591
but she could have
left a while ago.

12:39.675 --> 12:43.094
Most printer sales
are done over the phone,
Miss Boob Shirt.

12:43.220 --> 12:44.846
l'm going
with Pam's group.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.848
Wait. Michael.

12:48.017 --> 12:49.392
Okay.
Michael. Michael.

12:49.477 --> 12:53.438
No. Guys, guys, guys, guys,
just thank you for talking.

12:54.690 --> 12:56.357
Wish me luck.
JlM: No.

12:56.692 --> 12:59.486
What sort of movie
would Rudy have been
if he had just stopped

12:59.570 --> 13:02.030
and given up
after two rejections?

13:04.116 --> 13:07.285
Would have been a lot shorter,
probably been a lot funnier,

13:07.369 --> 13:10.663
but it would have
ultimately been
a disappointment.

13:10.873 --> 13:16.544
l still would have seen it,
but that's not the point.

13:19.548 --> 13:21.841
Kelly is disqualified.
What?

13:22.051 --> 13:24.010
You said the program
is not open to Caucasians.

13:24.094 --> 13:27.931
Well, anthropologically,
she is lndian.

13:28.015 --> 13:31.142
lndians migrated
from the Caucasus
region of Europe.

13:31.227 --> 13:34.521
Therefore, technically,
she is Caucasian.
You're welcome, America.

13:34.605 --> 13:36.105
Yeah, but she's
not white, though.

13:36.190 --> 13:38.566
Well, obviously
she's brownish,

13:38.651 --> 13:41.611
but come on.
l mean, Darryl is
far more ethnic.

13:41.695 --> 13:43.488
Darryl withdrew
his application.

13:43.572 --> 13:48.409
The dates of the Yale program
interfered with his softball
league, so he's gone.

13:49.119 --> 13:51.704
l got my whole life
to be a minority executive.

13:51.789 --> 13:54.457
l only have about
a year left in
these knees, though.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.501
So Kelly is
the only applicant.

13:56.585 --> 13:58.586
Yeah, unless somebody
else applies today.

l'll be right back.

14:11.433 --> 14:12.559
Hello.

14:12.643 --> 14:15.144
That's very nice.
l never noticed
that before.

14:15.229 --> 14:16.855
Sometimes my bangs cover it.

14:16.939 --> 14:21.192
Yeah. l don't want
to be offensive, but may
l ask you what that means?

14:21.277 --> 14:23.778
l do find that offensive,
actually.

14:24.697 --> 14:27.782
We should have
your contract done
by Thursday.

14:28.200 --> 14:31.202
Oh, great! Great.
l will look out
for that stuff, then.

14:31.287 --> 14:32.787
Okay.

put you on a fast track

to an executive position
at this company?

15:48.238 --> 15:50.281
Holy cow.

l'd be happy for them.

Speaking of rainbows,

of a double minority.

from your perspective.

l was seeing this really
hot urologist about it
