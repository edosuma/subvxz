00:08.210 --> 00:12.350
Oh, I'm so excited.
<i>Grease</i> is my favorite musical.

00:12.380 --> 00:14.320
The costumes, the songs...

00:14.350 --> 00:16.190
The male chauvinism.

00:17.360 --> 00:18.460
What?

00:18.490 --> 00:20.490
The play is completely sexist.

00:20.530 --> 00:23.230
The men treat the women like doormats.

00:23.260 --> 00:25.460
It's like it takes place in the 1950s!

00:27.170 --> 00:29.330
It does take place in the 1950s.

00:30.440 --> 00:33.100
Oh. Carry on then.

00:38.440 --> 00:42.380
Hey, what's cookin', good lookin'?

00:42.410 --> 00:44.420
You know, you don't have
to stay in character

00:44.450 --> 00:47.050
when we're not on stage, Jared.

00:47.090 --> 00:49.350
Who's Jared?
I'm Danny Zuko.

00:49.390 --> 00:53.260
Ruffian. Drag racer supreme.
King of the streets.

00:53.290 --> 00:57.460
King of the streets?
Your mom drives you to school every morning.

00:57.500 --> 01:01.270
Sandy. You. Me.
Dance floor. Now.

01:01.300 --> 01:05.140
Nice. Ordering a woman
around like she's your dog.

01:05.170 --> 01:07.210
What a delightful throwback.

01:07.240 --> 01:10.170
If you want me, I'll be in the 21st
century, enjoying women's rights.

01:21.420 --> 01:23.150
Look at Jared making his move on Chyna.

01:24.090 --> 01:25.990
They don't en have chemistry.

01:26.030 --> 01:28.390
She and I do. Third period.
With Mrs. Sterling.

01:30.030 --> 01:31.430
I still can't believe Chyna got the lead.

01:31.460 --> 01:34.400
I've always been the lead!
I can't play Rizzo.

01:34.430 --> 01:37.400
She's a mean, manipulative brunette.

01:37.440 --> 01:40.170
I'm nothing like that.
I'm blonde.

01:41.410 --> 01:44.140
<i>Okay, let's take it</i>
<i>from the top!</i>

01:44.180 --> 01:47.150
<i>Remember Zimbaldi's</i>
<i>five keys to acting.</i>

01:47.180 --> 01:50.010
<i>Acting, energy,</i>
<i>commitment, choices,</i>

01:50.050 --> 01:53.220
<i>acting, energy,</i>
<i>acting, and acting!</i>

01:53.250 --> 01:57.090
Stop in the name of the law!
The theater law!

01:57.120 --> 01:59.320
<i>Who are you</i> <i>and what
are you</i> <i>doing here?</i>

02:01.060 --> 02:04.400
The name's French.
Samuel French.

02:04.430 --> 02:07.170
I work for the company that licenses plays,

02:07.200 --> 02:11.400
and I was informed you are
using <i>Grease.</i> Hmm?

02:11.440 --> 02:13.440
Without paying for the rights.

02:15.210 --> 02:17.280
Is that true?
Yes, it is, missy.

02:17.310 --> 02:20.040
What's happening here is more wrong

02:20.080 --> 02:22.380
than eating carbs
after 7:00 p.m.

02:22.410 --> 02:25.250
As of this moment, this
production is shut down!

02:25.280 --> 02:28.190
What? You can't do that.
The play's on Friday!

02:28.220 --> 02:30.220
We've been rehearsing this all year!

02:30.260 --> 02:34.060
Tough tiaras, cookie.
This is the theater law.

02:34.090 --> 02:37.960
The most important law there is.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.170
Other than like, maybe, murder law.

02:41.200 --> 02:43.230
<i>How did you even</i>
<i>find out about this?</i>

02:46.240 --> 02:49.240
We received an anonymous tip.

02:49.270 --> 02:51.410
It was Lexi Reed.
Ooh, I'm such a gossip.

03:49.300 --> 03:51.170
What are you doing, Gibson?

03:51.200 --> 03:54.240
I was in the men's room taking a shower.
Gotta stay fresh!

03:56.240 --> 03:58.940
But the men's room doesn't have a shower.

03:58.980 --> 04:01.150
Oh, I just use a urinal and hand soap.

04:03.180 --> 04:05.820
You do know the bathroom has a sink, right?

04:05.850 --> 04:09.050
Ugh, sinks are filthy.

04:09.090 --> 04:13.020
People wash their hands in them.

04:13.060 --> 04:17.260
Hey, here's a crazy idea.
Shower at your house.

04:17.300 --> 04:20.100
Actually, I've been for the past week,

04:20.130 --> 04:23.940
ever since Nana had her
new husband Bob move in.

04:25.200 --> 04:28.210
What's so bad about Bob?

04:28.240 --> 04:30.140
He wants me
to call him "Grandpa."

04:30.180 --> 04:35.180
I wouldn't call Bob "Grandpa" if
he were the last man on Earth.

04:35.210 --> 04:38.280
Mostly because if he were the last
man on Earth, I would be dead.

04:40.990 --> 04:43.020
Why don't you just find your own place?

04:43.060 --> 04:44.220
You're a grown man.

04:48.990 --> 04:50.190
On paper, at least.

04:51.960 --> 04:55.270
I'm trying, but I can
only afford $500 a month.

04:55.300 --> 04:58.140
$500 a month? Hmm...

04:59.100 --> 05:01.070
I think I might know a place.

05:04.310 --> 05:07.980
It's beautiful, but is there
a lot of street noise?

05:08.010 --> 05:10.180
No, none at all.
It's really quiet.

05:10.220 --> 05:12.180
Oh, that won't work for me.

05:12.220 --> 05:15.220
I can't sleep unless there's
a lot of street noise.

05:16.290 --> 05:18.220
It's incredibly noisy.

05:18.260 --> 05:21.260
I thought you said, "Are
there a lot of cheese toys?"

05:22.260 --> 05:25.830
Okay, good.
Next question.

05:25.860 --> 05:28.270
Are there a lot of cheese toys?

05:28.300 --> 05:30.270
Because I love cheese toys.

05:35.910 --> 05:37.280
Mr. Zimbaldi, we can't
cancel the musical.

05:37.310 --> 05:40.210
This is my one chance to sing in public.

05:40.250 --> 05:43.150
What about that time you sang
<i>Dynamite</i> <i>at my party?</i>

05:43.180 --> 05:46.950
And when you sang <i>Unstoppable</i>
<i>in the hallway?</i>

05:46.990 --> 05:49.120
I mean, this is one of the few moments
you're not singing in public.

05:51.190 --> 05:54.290
Mr. Zimbaldi, I've been looking
forward to the musical all year.

05:54.330 --> 05:56.860
Can't you just write a new play?

05:56.900 --> 05:58.930
If I could write a play, do you
think I'd be a high school teacher?

06:01.170 --> 06:02.870
What if I write it?

06:02.900 --> 06:05.100
Why does she get to write it and not me?

06:05.140 --> 06:09.170
Hey! Danny Zuko
wants to write it!

06:09.210 --> 06:12.040
Would you stop?
We're not even doing that play anymore!

06:13.910 --> 06:16.810
Tell you what.
We'll do this democratically.

06:16.850 --> 06:18.820
Everyone will pitch their ideas to me

06:18.850 --> 06:21.020
and I will unilaterally pick the winner

06:21.050 --> 06:23.020
without any input from anyone else.

06:24.860 --> 06:27.090
I'm pretty sure that's not
what "democratically" means.

06:27.130 --> 06:29.930
If I knew what words meant, do you
think I'd be a high school teacher?

06:33.300 --> 06:36.870
Okay, first up.
Fletcher Quimby.

06:36.900 --> 06:39.100
My play combines two classics.

06:39.140 --> 06:42.170
<i>Fiddler on the Roof,</i>
<i>and</i> <i>Batman.</i>

06:42.210 --> 06:46.040
I present to you,
"Riddler On The Roof."

06:50.980 --> 06:54.050
Riddler! How did you get
into the Bat Village?

06:55.120 --> 06:57.860
Riddle me this, Tevye!

06:57.890 --> 06:59.990
When is a door not a door?

07:00.960 --> 07:03.260
When it's ajar!

07:03.300 --> 07:09.000
Again with the riddles!
I never know what you're talking about!

07:09.030 --> 07:13.000
I'm saying I want to marry your
daughter, the lovely Chynala.

07:13.040 --> 07:15.170
I've loved her ever since her Bat Mitzvah.

07:16.980 --> 07:19.840
In that case, I propose a toast.

07:19.880 --> 07:21.150
To life!

07:21.180 --> 07:23.210
In prison! For you!

07:35.130 --> 07:36.960
My play is the sequel to <i>Annie,</i>

07:37.000 --> 07:39.130
where she's old and living
in a retirement home.

07:39.160 --> 07:41.270
It's called "Grannie."

07:47.870 --> 07:52.210
Don't worry, Sandy.
I'm sure my son will come visit me tomorrow.

07:55.880 --> 07:58.980
Mildred!
Enough with the piano!

07:59.020 --> 08:02.890
Since the orphanage, every time
someone says the word "tomorrow"

08:02.920 --> 08:04.890
you start with that stupid song!

08:06.790 --> 08:07.990
I'm sick of it!

08:09.130 --> 08:11.000
And you cheat at canasta!

08:14.200 --> 08:18.000
Mr. Zimbaldi, I know
everybody else's ideas

08:18.040 --> 08:20.100
were half-baked
vanity projects,

08:20.140 --> 08:22.170
but I know that mine is different.

08:22.210 --> 08:26.040
I present to you
"The Lexi King."

08:28.850 --> 08:32.980
Mrs. Reed, you've given birth
to the most beautiful baby

08:33.020 --> 08:36.049
in the history of the entire world.

08:36.090 --> 08:39.090
She's a gift, not just to you,

08:39.120 --> 08:41.130
but to all humanity.

08:45.160 --> 08:46.830
Thank you, Doctor.

08:48.100 --> 08:51.970
I shall name her Lexi!

09:04.020 --> 09:07.120
I propose that
we put on <i>Grease!</i>

09:08.950 --> 09:10.820
Forget it.

09:10.860 --> 09:13.760
I am not getting into another
slap fight with Samuel French.

09:14.960 --> 09:18.830
No. Greece,
as in Ancient Greece.

09:18.860 --> 09:21.800
Birthplace of democracy, philosophy,

09:21.830 --> 09:23.770
and most importantly, breaking plates.

09:25.840 --> 09:26.900
I love it!

09:28.170 --> 09:29.940
Chyna, you'll be the female lead,

09:29.980 --> 09:31.080
Jared, you'll be the male lead.

09:31.110 --> 09:32.910
What?

09:32.940 --> 09:35.880
This is perfect! I mean, we already
have the <i>Grease</i> tickets,

09:35.910 --> 09:39.680
and posters printed up, and
your version is one letter off.

09:39.720 --> 09:43.720
Well, actually, it's two letters off.

09:43.760 --> 09:48.450
If I knew how to spell, do you think
I'd be a high school teacher?

09:58.110 --> 10:02.850
Yeah, so my parents are totally cool
with you renting our living room.

10:02.880 --> 10:05.090
So cool that I didn't even tell them.

10:07.060 --> 10:10.090
Oh, and you just might want
to make the check out to me.

10:10.130 --> 10:13.190
Can I pay you in cash?
I don't believe in banks.

10:13.230 --> 10:15.000
Not even blood banks.

10:15.030 --> 10:18.930
I just give bleeding people
bags of loose blood myself.

10:21.100 --> 10:23.240
Gibson, quick!
Let's play hide-and-seek.

10:23.270 --> 10:25.870
You hide underneath the sofa
cushion and I'll look for you.

10:25.910 --> 10:27.880
Okay, but you'll never find me!

10:31.310 --> 10:33.050
Okay, here I go!

10:33.080 --> 10:34.980
Where's Gibson?
Where's Gibson?

10:35.020 --> 10:36.120
I don't know.

10:38.920 --> 10:39.920
Where is he?

10:39.950 --> 10:40.950
I don't know.

10:43.320 --> 10:45.190
Hey, Dad! What's up?

10:45.230 --> 10:48.860
Hey, Cam. I thought I heard
you talking to someone.

10:48.900 --> 10:52.100
Oh, no. That was
just me practicing my

10:52.130 --> 10:53.300
ventriloquism.

10:55.940 --> 10:58.070
Really?
You do ventriloquism?

10:59.170 --> 11:01.040
You even move your lips when you read.

11:03.310 --> 11:04.980
Okay, let me hear.

11:06.150 --> 11:09.080
I've named my dummy

11:11.220 --> 11:13.250
Gibson.
What?

11:13.290 --> 11:15.960
Gibson?
What?

11:15.990 --> 11:20.030
Isn't Gibson the name of that
curly-haired weirdo from the Ant Farm?

11:21.930 --> 11:22.960
That's me!

11:25.030 --> 11:27.270
Hey, Gibson!
How you doing?

11:27.300 --> 11:31.310
It's dark in here!
I'm scared!

11:32.940 --> 11:34.840
Where are the cheese toys?

11:36.110 --> 11:39.050
Not bad.
I can't see your lips move.

11:40.220 --> 11:44.080
You weigh a ton!

11:45.990 --> 11:47.860
Get off me, lardo!

11:50.160 --> 11:52.930
Hey, you tell your sock
to put a sock in it!

12:03.100 --> 12:05.970
Hey, Olive, I read
your version of "Greece."

12:06.010 --> 12:07.940
And it's great,

12:07.980 --> 12:10.980
but I do have a few notes.

12:11.910 --> 12:13.880
Notes? You have notes?

12:13.920 --> 12:17.250
No, no.
Just one page. Okay?

12:28.860 --> 12:31.770
Okay, first of all,

12:31.800 --> 12:34.100
there are all these long speeches

12:34.140 --> 12:36.940
where characters talk
directly to the audience.

12:36.970 --> 12:39.140
Those are called
"theatrical asides."

12:39.170 --> 12:44.010
They're a classical device where characters
reveal their true inner feelings.

12:44.050 --> 12:45.880
Can you believe she's pitching an idea

12:45.910 --> 12:47.880
where a character breaks
the reality of the play

12:47.920 --> 12:49.820
and speaks directly to the viewer?

12:51.290 --> 12:53.290
I mean, it just...
It makes no sense!

12:55.990 --> 12:58.230
Chyna, I can still hear you.

13:01.300 --> 13:03.160
Okay, next note.

13:05.230 --> 13:08.040
Given it's the annual musical,

13:08.070 --> 13:09.770
I was thinking it might be good

13:09.800 --> 13:12.210
if it maybe had some music in it.

13:12.240 --> 13:16.110
I guess I could add a killer
acoustic panpipe solo

13:16.140 --> 13:18.110
in the 20 minute ode to Poseidon.

13:24.020 --> 13:26.020
Okay.

13:26.050 --> 13:29.220
I was thinking maybe something
a little more contemporary.

13:30.890 --> 13:33.760
Instead of the traditional
version of Aphrodite,

13:33.800 --> 13:36.960
we'll have Afro-dite!

13:40.030 --> 13:43.140
I'm foxy Afro-dite,
goddess of soul,

13:43.170 --> 13:46.240
and I'm going to do a little
"Showtime for the Apollos."

13:47.980 --> 13:50.880
Apollo, Mrs. Apollo,
enjoy the show.

13:54.020 --> 13:55.180
<i>♪ Gonna boogie down</i>

13:55.220 --> 13:57.820
<i>♪ There ain't no stoppin' us</i>

13:57.850 --> 14:01.790
<i>♪ There's a party goin' on</i>
<i>at the Disco Acropolis! ♪</i>

14:05.060 --> 14:09.160
Oh, and instead of Zeus, we'll have

14:10.830 --> 14:11.900
Jay-Zeus.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.900
<i>♪ Jay to the Zeus</i>

14:15.940 --> 14:18.070

14:36.190 --> 14:39.960
First of all, they didn't
rap in ancient Greece.

14:39.990 --> 14:42.100
And second, who raps without punctuating it

14:42.130 --> 14:44.130
by saying, "Holla"?

14:47.070 --> 14:50.800
Y'all see what I have to deal with?

14:50.840 --> 14:54.010
Writers.
Unbelievable.

15:01.850 --> 15:02.920
Hey, Jared.

15:05.750 --> 15:07.050
Sorry. I mean, Zeus.

15:08.760 --> 15:09.860
Approach.

15:10.730 --> 15:11.990
Great news.

15:12.030 --> 15:14.090
Olive and I made some changes
to the play and added songs.

15:14.130 --> 15:16.000
I think you're gonna love it.

15:16.030 --> 15:20.100
Changes? The mighty Zeus
doesn't do changes.

15:21.170 --> 15:23.100
You have way more lines.

15:23.140 --> 15:24.910
Love it! Brilliant work!

15:30.910 --> 15:33.110
Chyna is totally going to
fall for her leading man.

15:33.150 --> 15:36.880
Jareeven looks good in that stupid beard.

15:36.920 --> 15:39.920
I can't even grow one of those
mustaches that looks like sweat.

15:42.120 --> 15:45.090
I don't want this play to go on either.

15:45.130 --> 15:48.960
If I can't be the lead, there
won't be any play at all.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
What are you suggesting?

15:51.030 --> 15:56.770
Ordinarily, I would have Chyna
meet with an unfortunate accident,

15:56.800 --> 15:58.770
but everyone would know it was me.

16:00.740 --> 16:03.010
But if we get rid of Jared,

16:03.040 --> 16:04.680
the play will still be canceled,

16:04.710 --> 16:06.650
and everyone will think it was you.

16:06.680 --> 16:07.710
We both win.

16:09.720 --> 16:11.890
Except you.
You get suspended.

16:14.090 --> 16:15.790
That's genius!

16:25.990 --> 16:29.130
Are you sure this the best
way to sabotage Jared?

16:29.160 --> 16:33.060
I don't know.
For this hypnosis kit

16:33.100 --> 16:35.400
and felt strangely compelled to buy it.

16:36.970 --> 16:38.030
Just go.

16:40.240 --> 16:43.170
Hey, Jared. Check out this
new watch Fletcher got.

16:44.140 --> 16:45.270
Show me, mortal!

16:47.210 --> 16:48.910
Cool, isn't it?

16:48.950 --> 16:52.080
You are getting very sleepy.

16:55.190 --> 16:57.950
You are now under my power.

16:57.990 --> 17:01.360
Heretic! The mighty Zeus
cannot be vexed.

17:01.390 --> 17:04.089
The mighty Zeus
is all-powerful.

17:04.130 --> 17:07.260
The mighty Zeus has to go
finish his math homework.

17:16.069 --> 17:19.180
What the... Gibson, what
did you do with the couch?

17:19.210 --> 17:21.980
I sold it to pay for the bunk bed.

17:22.010 --> 17:24.109
My roommate needed somewhere to sleep.

17:24.150 --> 17:26.020
You have a roommate?

17:26.050 --> 17:28.280
Yeah. To help pay the rent.
But don't worry.

17:28.319 --> 17:33.060
I did a background check and all seven
of his identities came up clean.

17:33.090 --> 17:37.030
Gibson, are you crazy?
When my dad sees this, he's going to flip!

17:37.060 --> 17:39.030
Ooh, I love gymnastics.

17:40.330 --> 17:42.330
Good, then let's see you tumble.

17:47.370 --> 17:48.370
Hey, Cameron.

17:48.410 --> 17:50.270
Hey, Dad.

17:50.310 --> 17:53.280
I'm exhausted.
I was tracking this identity thief,

17:53.310 --> 17:55.910
but he keeps changing addresses.

17:55.950 --> 17:58.410
Anyway, I just want to
relax and watch some TV.

18:01.290 --> 18:04.050
Why are there cheese toys
all over the place?

18:04.990 --> 18:06.120
Ow!

18:06.160 --> 18:08.060
Are you okay?
Do you need blood?

18:08.090 --> 18:13.100
Whoa! Cameron, tell me
what's going on. Now!

18:13.130 --> 18:16.100
All right, fine.
Gibson's been staying in the living room.

18:16.130 --> 18:18.900
I've been charging him
$500 rent. I'm sorry.

18:19.170 --> 18:20.970
You should be.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.910
Renting out the living room for $500?

18:22.940 --> 18:26.140
What's wrong with you?
We have a view of the Golden Gate Bridge, man!

18:26.180 --> 18:29.150
We could get at least 1200!

18:29.180 --> 18:33.050
Twelve hundred?
For a place without a urinal shower?

18:33.080 --> 18:35.350
We're out of here.
Come on, Wacky.

18:44.190 --> 18:47.060
What are we going to do?
The play is about to start.

18:48.000 --> 18:52.140
Wait, I have a wacky idea.

18:52.170 --> 18:54.940
Wacky! I just saw three
little pigs in the hallway.

19:03.050 --> 19:06.280

We already canceled

We cannot cancel the second <i>Greece</i>
