00:11.812 --> 00:13.879
May I have
your attention, please?

00:13.881 --> 00:16.482
The ferry will be
docking shortly.

00:16.484 --> 00:19.952
For your safety, all passengers
are to remain off stairs,

00:19.954 --> 00:22.621
ramps, and landings
until the ferry has come

00:22.623 --> 00:24.890
to a complete stop
at the terminal.

00:24.892 --> 00:28.494
Remain behind the designated
barriers for docking.

00:28.496 --> 00:31.964
Failure to do so could
result in serious injury.

00:31.966 --> 00:35.567
Thank you for riding
the Staten Island Ferry.

01:09.536 --> 01:11.003
Good evening.

01:40.967 --> 01:43.969
He looks pretty,
but he's actually
known as Sasquatch.

01:43.971 --> 01:46.572
Let's go.

01:48.309 --> 01:52.044
He's like a caveman.
Don't do that,
god damn it.

01:53.980 --> 01:58.584
Hey, buddy,
you missed the toilet
by about 100 feet.

01:58.586 --> 02:01.053
Have fun cleaning it up.

02:04.157 --> 02:06.058
Ben, come on, man.

02:07.761 --> 02:09.294
All right, let's go.

02:14.601 --> 02:16.602
Let go of the door.

02:16.604 --> 02:18.604
I'm gonna need an apology.

02:18.606 --> 02:20.539
Look, dude,
he's sorry, OK?

02:20.541 --> 02:22.007
Don't apologize
to this rent-a-cop.

02:22.009 --> 02:23.609
No, listen,
it's not a big deal.

02:23.611 --> 02:27.079
If you want to
keep your job, let go.

02:39.225 --> 02:41.026
What the fuck?

02:41.028 --> 02:42.628
What the fuck is going on?

02:42.630 --> 02:44.029
What the fuck was that?
What happened?

02:44.031 --> 02:45.631
Is it not moving?

02:45.633 --> 02:48.967
Damn!
Just do it... stop it!

02:57.944 --> 03:01.046
Hey, have you seen
"Yes Man," Jim Carrey?

03:01.048 --> 03:02.781
So funny, man.

03:02.783 --> 03:04.550
Hey, yo, man.
Jim Carrey. "Yes Man."

03:04.552 --> 03:05.951
He says "yes" all the time.

03:05.953 --> 03:08.654
Jim Carrey.
You know "The Mask"?
Green face?

03:08.656 --> 03:10.055
This one same.

03:10.057 --> 03:12.824
Hey, girls! "27 Dresses."
Katherine Heigl.

03:12.826 --> 03:15.060
She's been a bridesmaid
27 times.

03:15.062 --> 03:17.162
It's so good.
So romantic.

03:17.164 --> 03:19.665
No, thank you.

03:19.667 --> 03:22.067
What are you looking at?

03:39.085 --> 03:41.086
Hey, man,
you like Jim Carrey?

03:41.088 --> 03:42.688
"Yes Man"?

03:42.690 --> 03:45.157
Says "yes" all the time.
Can't stop saying "yes."

04:24.731 --> 04:28.133
Oh, excuse me.
Some of these buzzers
don't have names.

04:28.135 --> 04:30.135
Do you know
Bassam Jafari?
I'm looking for him.

04:30.137 --> 04:31.536
You a cop?

04:31.538 --> 04:32.971
I'm a friend of Bassam's.

04:32.973 --> 04:34.406
Bassam does not have friends,

04:34.408 --> 04:36.541
and you smell like a cop.

04:36.543 --> 04:38.243
I brought him a doughnut.

04:38.245 --> 04:41.146
That's probably what you're
talking about, smell-wise.

04:41.148 --> 04:43.315
Wow.

05:00.767 --> 05:02.167
- Hello?
- Bassam?

05:02.169 --> 05:03.835
Who's this?

05:03.837 --> 05:05.170
Hey, it's Sam Seneca.

05:05.172 --> 05:07.606
Sammy! Come on up!

05:20.186 --> 05:22.487
No more selling
DVD. You hear me?

05:24.190 --> 05:27.192
Sammy.
Bassam.

05:27.194 --> 05:29.194
Are you out of the Army?

05:29.196 --> 05:30.796
Yeah, yeah,
I just got out,

05:30.798 --> 05:33.158
and I brought your favorite.

05:33.801 --> 05:36.201
Oh.

05:36.203 --> 05:39.204
I have something else for you...

05:39.206 --> 05:41.273
as promised.

05:43.976 --> 05:45.877
You remembered.

05:49.415 --> 05:51.583
Amira!
You have to meet
my niece.

05:51.585 --> 05:53.218
- Amira!
- What?

05:53.220 --> 05:54.886
Come on out here.
No!

05:54.888 --> 05:56.288
Amira!

06:10.837 --> 06:13.071
You speak Arabic?
Yeah.

06:16.242 --> 06:17.843
I should go.

06:17.845 --> 06:19.244
No. It's just...
I should go.

06:19.246 --> 06:21.313
Come, come.

06:24.851 --> 06:27.519
Her brother was
a translator with
me in Iraq.

06:27.521 --> 06:29.254
He was caught in the crossfire

06:29.256 --> 06:32.858
during a raid
and was killed
by U.S. soldiers.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.993
That's why she left.

06:36.262 --> 06:38.864
Fuck. I'm sorry.
I should definitely go.

06:38.866 --> 06:40.866
No, no, no.
You will stay
and eat with us.

06:40.868 --> 06:42.267
Bassam, I should go.

06:42.269 --> 06:43.869
You will stay at our house.

06:43.871 --> 06:45.370
I don't want things
to be awkward, Bassam.

06:45.372 --> 06:47.292
They won't be awkward,
I promise.

07:03.290 --> 07:04.890
This is really delicious.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.291
Thank you.

07:06.293 --> 07:08.693
We're glad you enjoyed it.

07:12.699 --> 07:14.633
Hey, you want to hear
a funny story?

07:14.635 --> 07:16.034
Yes.
No.

07:17.904 --> 07:24.142
So, I left the Army
in part to take care of my
dad who is dying, right?

07:24.144 --> 07:25.677
This doesn't sound funny.

07:25.679 --> 07:28.313
It gets better.

07:31.918 --> 07:33.351
Um... uh, OK.

07:33.353 --> 07:36.521
So, my dad spent the last
few years of his life

07:36.523 --> 07:38.924
refurbishing and
selling antiques.

07:38.926 --> 07:42.327
So, the day that
I get in, he takes me out
antique hunting, right?

07:42.329 --> 07:45.931
And we stop at McDonald's
to get some food.

07:45.933 --> 07:47.699
This kid fucks up
his order, right?

07:47.701 --> 07:50.569
And he bites into his hamburger,
and there's a pickle in it.

07:50.571 --> 07:53.572
He fucking hates pickles,
so starts screaming at
this kid behind the counter.

07:53.574 --> 07:55.707
So, they go back and they're
remaking his cheeseburger,

07:55.709 --> 07:58.543
and he runs into one of these
guys that used to buy a lot
of antiques off him,

07:58.545 --> 08:01.513
and they're reminiscing
about these old axes that
my dad used to have.

08:01.515 --> 08:03.548
And my dad says, "Wait right
here. I'll be right back."

08:03.550 --> 08:06.585
Runs out to the car,
and this kid behind the
counter looks up,

08:06.587 --> 08:11.189
and sees my dad...
is now barreling towards
him with an giant ax.

08:11.191 --> 08:15.360
And he screams, "Aah!
I'm so sorry about
your cheeseburger."

08:15.362 --> 08:18.363
Don't kill me."
Ha ha ha!

08:18.365 --> 08:20.966
Then he shot himself.

08:20.968 --> 08:23.034
Smelled like it anyway.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.707
It's not funny.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.776
All right, well,
I have another story.

08:31.778 --> 08:34.379
So, there's a penguin
who's driving across country,

08:34.381 --> 08:36.147
and he's going
through the desert,

08:36.149 --> 08:37.883
just a penguin
in his little penguin car.

08:37.885 --> 08:40.150
And it was
a really hot day,
and he was driving along,

08:40.153 --> 08:41.986
eating ice cream
from the passenger seat,

08:41.989 --> 08:44.121
just like, "Oh,
it's so hot out here."

08:44.124 --> 08:47.592
And then his car breaks down
in the middle of the desert.

08:47.594 --> 08:50.428
So he calls, you know, AAA.

08:50.430 --> 08:55.000
AAA shows up, to find him
still eating his ice cream
in his car.

08:55.002 --> 08:57.402
And he says, "I don't know
what happened."

08:57.404 --> 09:02.474
And the guy from AAA says,
"It looks like
you blew a seal."

09:09.315 --> 09:12.417
"Looks like you blew a seal,"
'cause he was eating
vanilla ice cream.

09:12.419 --> 09:15.020
Like, blew a seal.
It's kind of like
a double entendre.

09:15.022 --> 09:18.423
You're talking about...
could be like a wheel
or something in the engine,

09:18.425 --> 09:21.660
but really like blew a seal.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.261
Is English
your third language?

09:23.263 --> 09:25.430
Well, Meredith,
tonight's the big night,

09:25.432 --> 09:27.599
the season finale of "Keeping
Up with the Kardashians."

09:27.601 --> 09:30.035
What can we expect
from tonight's episode?

09:30.037 --> 09:32.037
Well,
you know, Steve,
I gotta tell you.

09:32.039 --> 09:35.507
Everything that this family
seems to do just takes off!

09:35.509 --> 09:39.444
Fashion, style, family.
Everything about her is
just great.

09:39.446 --> 09:41.279
She really does
it all, doesn't she?

09:41.281 --> 09:42.847
She really does.

09:42.849 --> 09:46.952
Thank you for
a delicious meal
and shitty television.

09:50.222 --> 09:52.624
It's a high five.

09:52.626 --> 09:54.459
You won't give me
a high five?

09:54.461 --> 09:56.461
I give high fives
to strangers walking
down the street.

09:56.463 --> 09:58.063
We've had dinner...

09:58.065 --> 09:59.831
I only walked you
to the door because
Bassam is asleep

09:59.833 --> 10:02.153
and it would be rude
for me not to.

10:10.877 --> 10:14.245
So, I found out
my 6-year-old daughter
has a crush on a boy,

10:14.247 --> 10:16.915
and so I have to
kill that boy, right?

10:16.917 --> 10:20.085
I mean, I think that's
the only logical thing
for me to do.

10:20.087 --> 10:22.487
So, I walk up to the school,
and I'm like, "Where's Larry?"

10:22.489 --> 10:24.089
First of all,
his name is Larry.

10:24.091 --> 10:25.991
Let's back it up
one step, OK?

10:25.993 --> 10:28.493
Who the fuck calls their
6-year-old Larry, all right?

10:28.495 --> 10:31.162
I was already suspect
to this kid's parents.

10:31.164 --> 10:33.198
So, I walk up there
and I lock eyes with him,

10:33.200 --> 10:36.501
and I look at him,
and I say, "Oh, my God,
he's so fuckin' cute!"

10:36.503 --> 10:39.104
He's awesome.
He loves sports.
We're hangin' out.

10:39.106 --> 10:41.406
I turn to my daughter.
I'm like, "Marry Larry!"

10:42.909 --> 10:45.510
"Let's just get this thing
over with, right?"

10:45.512 --> 10:47.232
You guys ready for
some more comedy?

10:48.615 --> 10:51.116
Put your hands together for
Mr. Sam Seneca, everyone. Yeah!

10:55.121 --> 10:56.688
Hello.

10:56.690 --> 10:58.590
Whoo! Yeah!

11:00.192 --> 11:01.526
Hi.

11:01.528 --> 11:03.595
Um, I'm Sam Seneca.

11:05.531 --> 11:08.400
And...

11:08.402 --> 11:11.202
what are all of your names?

11:14.140 --> 11:16.608
I'll get into
my stuff here.

11:19.545 --> 11:22.547
Uh... so...

11:22.549 --> 11:24.616
"Jokes and Stuff."
Here we go.

11:27.286 --> 11:29.587
I never used to
believe in aliens,

11:29.589 --> 11:32.557
and then I started watching
reality television.

11:32.559 --> 11:39.631
Now I'm pretty sure that
the Kardashians are here
to destroy the planet Earth.

11:46.572 --> 11:50.175
One person watches that show.

11:50.177 --> 11:52.577
Um...

11:52.579 --> 11:55.180
I was walking past
a Kindergarten.

11:55.182 --> 11:58.249
I wasn't going out of
my way to walk past it.

11:58.251 --> 12:00.485
It was just in my route.

12:00.487 --> 12:07.492
But anyway, I noticed that
these Kindergartners
were large in size

12:07.494 --> 12:11.196
and general mass...
they were, like, 450 pounds,

12:11.198 --> 12:12.864
which is the basic question:

12:12.866 --> 12:16.101
What are we
feeding our kids?

12:16.103 --> 12:17.602
Other kids?

12:21.207 --> 12:24.676
Oh, fuck it. Sorry.

12:52.638 --> 12:56.641
Now...
I know I had it.

12:56.643 --> 12:58.843
I just...

12:58.845 --> 13:00.645
Because you called.
Mm-hmm, I did.

13:00.647 --> 13:02.647
And we spoke.
That's true.

13:02.649 --> 13:06.184
And I pulled it.
Where did I put it?

13:06.186 --> 13:08.720
Come on, Janet.
It's meow or never.

13:08.722 --> 13:10.588
What?

13:10.590 --> 13:12.824
Nothing.
Oh.

13:12.826 --> 13:14.559
Hey, what's your
favorite Broadway play?

13:14.561 --> 13:16.361
Found it!

13:16.363 --> 13:19.364
That's my file.
I knew you could do it.

13:19.366 --> 13:24.269
Wait. Well,
maybe this is right.

13:24.271 --> 13:25.670
What is it? What?

13:25.672 --> 13:29.207
Well, it says that you
did multiple tours

13:29.209 --> 13:31.676
and you're not
claiming disability.

13:31.678 --> 13:33.511
Yep.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.613
Why is that?

13:35.615 --> 13:38.349
Because I'm not disabled.

13:39.685 --> 13:42.720
You should still file a claim.

13:42.722 --> 13:45.290
I'm not looking
for a handout.

13:45.292 --> 13:50.094
All I need from you
is a copy of my
medical records.

13:50.096 --> 13:51.696
Can you please
do that for me?

13:51.698 --> 13:53.298
Sure.

13:53.300 --> 13:54.699
Thank you.

13:54.701 --> 13:57.435
I just...

13:57.437 --> 14:00.757
I just don't think
I've ever met
anyone like you.

14:02.274 --> 14:04.776
Well, that feeling is mutual.

15:28.394 --> 15:31.462
And when we do, he would
give it back to me.

15:54.687 --> 15:58.823
I'm going on
another long job today.

15:58.825 --> 16:00.825
Behave while I'm gone.

16:00.827 --> 16:02.894
OK.

16:12.671 --> 16:13.905
You wanted to see me?

16:13.907 --> 16:15.673
I'm gonna have to
let you go, Sam.

16:15.675 --> 16:17.842
Fuck.
Fuck is right.

16:17.844 --> 16:19.444
Apparently those
assholes you trapped
in the elevator

16:19.446 --> 16:20.945
have friends in high places.

16:20.947 --> 16:22.447
Yeah.

16:22.449 --> 16:24.849
You ever collect
unemployment before?

16:24.851 --> 16:26.517
Because with your
military background,

16:26.519 --> 16:29.354
you may even be
eligible for some
disabilities.

16:29.356 --> 16:32.457
No. I'll find another
job. I'll be fine.

16:32.459 --> 16:34.459
Do what you gotta do, kid.

16:34.461 --> 16:35.927
Hey, Sam.
Yeah.

16:37.863 --> 16:40.932
Good luck, huh?
Thank you, Robert.

16:46.205 --> 16:48.873
Yeah, Lawrence,
can you... yeah.

16:48.875 --> 16:51.542
Can you listen to me
for a second?

16:51.544 --> 16:54.479
Just... I promise you
today.

16:54.481 --> 16:55.881
I am gonna paper
something together,

16:55.882 --> 16:57.482
and we're gonna be
in great shape.

16:57.484 --> 16:59.804
You have to trust me.
You have to trust me.

17:00.487 --> 17:01.886
Come in!

17:01.888 --> 17:05.490
Yeah, yeah. Hey.

17:05.492 --> 17:07.492
Can I call you back?

17:07.493 --> 17:08.893
OK, bye.

17:08.895 --> 17:11.329
Hey, man.
How you doing, dude?

17:11.330 --> 17:12.930
Good to see ya.

17:12.932 --> 17:14.898
How are you, Charlie?
I'm good, I'm good, man.

17:14.901 --> 17:16.733
How's that job?

17:16.736 --> 17:18.736
I got fired.

17:18.738 --> 17:21.406
Oh, no shit, man.
I'm sorry, dude.

17:21.407 --> 17:23.307
What happened?
It's not your fault.

17:23.309 --> 17:25.742
I really appreciate you
putting in a good word
for me and everything.

17:25.744 --> 17:27.912
I'm sorry to hear that.
Why'd you get fired?

17:27.914 --> 17:29.781
I locked a couple guys
in an elevator.

17:29.783 --> 17:33.584
You lock...
that's amazing.
That's awesome.

17:33.586 --> 17:36.788
Why... How did that... Why
did you lock a couple
guys in an elevator?

17:36.790 --> 17:38.356
They were being
drunk and stupid.

17:38.358 --> 17:40.091
It's my fault.
I shouldn't have done it.

17:40.093 --> 17:42.927
No. Well, if they
were being assholes,
fuck 'em, dude.

17:42.929 --> 17:44.595
Here.
Have a seat, man.

17:44.597 --> 17:46.264
Let's shoot the shit here.

17:46.266 --> 17:47.965
So, what are you
gonna do now?

17:47.967 --> 17:49.534
With no job,
what are you gonna do?

17:49.536 --> 17:51.536
I don't know. Yeah.
I don't know.

17:51.538 --> 17:53.538
Where are you living?

17:53.540 --> 17:56.941
Oh, I actually just
found a great place
on Staten Island.

17:56.943 --> 17:59.177
Staten Island has great places?

17:59.179 --> 18:00.945
Well...
It's amazing.

18:00.947 --> 18:02.613
Yeah, it's cheaper
than Manhattan.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.048
Hey, man,
in all sincerity,

18:04.050 --> 18:06.551
I'd be more than happy
to lend you some cash

18:06.553 --> 18:08.186
for a place in Manhattan.

18:08.188 --> 18:09.954
I know. I appreciate it.
I really do.

18:09.956 --> 18:11.956
OK.
But I can't take it.

18:11.958 --> 18:13.524
Not a chance.

18:13.526 --> 18:15.359
I figured
you would say that.

18:15.361 --> 18:17.562
But I do have something
I've been wanting to
give you, man,

18:17.564 --> 18:19.564
for a while now.

18:19.566 --> 18:20.965
Here.
What is this?

18:20.967 --> 18:23.501
It's the keys
to Grandpa's boat.

18:23.503 --> 18:26.571
It's still docked
down in Brooklyn.
You can have her.

18:26.573 --> 18:28.673
He left it to you.
Are you serious?

18:28.675 --> 18:30.708
Yeah, man. I mean,
I never use her,

18:30.710 --> 18:31.976
and she's just
sitting out there.

18:31.978 --> 18:33.578
And you're my favorite
cousin, so...

18:33.580 --> 18:35.580
figure she'd be better
off in your hands.

18:35.582 --> 18:37.048
That's incredible.
Thank you.

18:37.050 --> 18:39.584
Of course, man.
Of course.

18:39.586 --> 18:42.253
Hey, man, we should
hang out, dude.

18:42.255 --> 18:43.988
Let's hang out
more often.
I never see you.

18:43.990 --> 18:45.656
What are you doing tonight?

18:45.658 --> 18:46.991
You want to get
a drink with
me and my buddies?

18:46.993 --> 18:48.593
Yeah. Yeah,
that sounds great.

18:49.996 --> 18:51.662
Awesome. Let's do
it. Awesome.

18:51.664 --> 18:53.731
Ah, this guy.
I gotta grab this,
man.

18:53.733 --> 18:54.999
Yeah. No worries.

18:55.001 --> 18:56.601
Hey. Hold on a second.

18:56.603 --> 18:58.736
Sammy, um... do you
have a girlfriend?

18:58.738 --> 19:00.538
No.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.607
OK, I'm gonna hook you
up with Claire's friend
Simone.

19:02.609 --> 19:04.408
She's like...
fucking insane.

19:04.410 --> 19:06.377
Insane's not really
what I'm going for.

19:06.379 --> 19:09.113
No, no, like
insane in a good way.
Trust me.

19:09.115 --> 19:12.016
Roger that.

19:12.018 --> 19:15.019
All right, man.
I'll see you tonight.

19:15.021 --> 19:16.687
Thank you.

19:19.024 --> 19:21.259
Hey, man.
How you doing?

19:22.929 --> 19:25.029
Sam, I'm tellin'
you, man... Charlie.

19:25.031 --> 19:26.631
Yeah.

19:26.633 --> 19:28.132
Where were we
on September 12th?

19:28.134 --> 19:30.034
The next day.
No, the next
fuckin' morning.

19:30.036 --> 19:31.702
Yeah. Dude, the next
morning,

19:31.704 --> 19:33.037
straight to the Armory.

19:33.039 --> 19:34.639
Wanted to sign up.
Yep.

19:34.641 --> 19:36.874
Well, what happened?
Why didn't you do it?

19:36.876 --> 19:39.377
I don't even...
Well, I...

19:39.379 --> 19:41.145
I don't even remember.

19:41.147 --> 19:44.482
I can't remember,
but we were like
this fuckin' close.

19:44.484 --> 19:46.117
So fuckin' close.

19:46.119 --> 19:49.420
Well, looks like you guys
made out all right.

19:49.422 --> 19:51.055
Hmm...

19:51.057 --> 19:54.292
Hey, I want to
propose a toast to Sam,

19:54.294 --> 19:56.093
you know, to all
the heroes out there

19:56.095 --> 19:59.096
doing what they are
doing so that we can
do what we need to do.

19:59.098 --> 20:01.098
OK? Cheers. Sam.
Sammy, thank you.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.833
Cheers.

20:02.835 --> 20:07.071
Sam, man. What's the
craziest shit
you saw out there?

20:07.073 --> 20:08.673
You want the craziest?

20:08.675 --> 20:10.675
Yeah, craziest,
the scariest, whatever,

20:10.677 --> 20:13.077
like the Rambo-type shit.

20:13.079 --> 20:15.813
Do you want the scariest,
or do you want the craziest?

20:15.815 --> 20:18.115
I don't know.
Everything.

20:18.117 --> 20:19.684
Come on, man,
hit me, hit me.

20:19.686 --> 20:22.653
All right,
all right. So, we...

20:22.655 --> 20:25.790
we come back
a little bit early
from our patrol.

20:25.792 --> 20:27.091
Highway?

20:27.093 --> 20:29.594
Narang.

20:29.596 --> 20:32.163
Kunar Province.

20:34.700 --> 20:36.100
Afghanistan.

20:36.102 --> 20:38.302
Right. Yeah, yeah, OK.
Afghanistan.

20:38.304 --> 20:40.705
So, we come back
a little bit early
from our patrol,

20:40.707 --> 20:43.107
and our battalion
chaplain wasn't
expecting us.

20:43.109 --> 20:47.111
And so I walk into
his little makeshift
office,

20:47.113 --> 20:50.114
and I see him
crouched in the corner

20:50.116 --> 20:52.717
beating off so savagely,

20:52.719 --> 20:55.786
like just going at it
like he had a gun
to his head.

20:55.788 --> 20:57.722
And we lock eyes...

20:57.724 --> 21:00.858
the most unfortunate
eye contact I've ever
made with another human.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.126
Oh ho ho!

21:02.128 --> 21:03.728
Him with his meat
in his hand,

21:03.730 --> 21:07.965
me eager to get back
out on patrol
and get shot at.

21:07.967 --> 21:13.137
And then it hits me,
as I'm eye-to-eye
with this man.

21:13.139 --> 21:15.139
He's still wearing
his fucking helmet.

21:15.141 --> 21:17.141
He was so excited
to beat off

21:17.143 --> 21:20.144
that he didn't take his
fucking helmet off...

21:20.146 --> 21:22.146
or he has explosive semen.

21:22.148 --> 21:23.748
Ha ha ha ha!

21:23.750 --> 21:26.150
I've got a question
for you guys.
Yeah.

21:26.152 --> 21:28.152
What's the worst thing
that you could hear

21:28.154 --> 21:31.155
after giving Willie
Nelson a blow job?

21:31.157 --> 21:33.157
I'm not Willie Nelson.

21:33.159 --> 21:35.226
Ha ha ha!

21:43.168 --> 21:44.769
Buddy boy.

21:44.771 --> 21:46.237
Charlie.
How are you, man?

21:46.239 --> 21:48.205
Good.
Yeah?

21:48.207 --> 21:51.175
So, listen, man.
I've been tryin' to
land this investment fund

21:51.177 --> 21:52.843
for a couple years now.

21:52.845 --> 21:55.212
It's run by this Army dude,
this Vietnam vet.

21:55.214 --> 21:57.181
And I have him
really fuckin' close,

21:57.183 --> 21:58.582
but I can't get him
to bite.

21:58.584 --> 22:00.785
So, I have this idea.

22:00.787 --> 22:03.254
Would you be willing
to meet with him?

22:03.256 --> 22:05.189
About... what?

22:05.191 --> 22:06.791
Investing in my fund.

22:06.793 --> 22:08.793
I don't even know
what hedge funds are.

22:08.795 --> 22:11.195
No. You don't have to
know anything about
hedge funds.

22:11.197 --> 22:14.198
Listen, my business
is just like any
other business.

22:14.200 --> 22:17.435
It's just about
one thing. It's
about relationships.

22:17.437 --> 22:21.439
So, if you can
get this guy to
commit to $10 million,

22:21.441 --> 22:24.208
I will cut you a check
for 50K.

22:26.211 --> 22:27.745
You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

22:27.747 --> 22:29.046
I'm not fucking kidding you.

22:29.048 --> 22:30.481
Listen, go in there.

22:30.483 --> 22:33.484
You slip him the old
Army handshake
or whatever,

22:33.486 --> 22:37.621
you swap a few
war stories and shit,
you know.

22:37.623 --> 22:39.457
He'll be eating out
of the palm of your hand.

22:39.459 --> 22:41.992
I was looking at
you earlier, man.
You're charismatic.

22:41.994 --> 22:44.829
You got charm.
People fuckin' love you.

22:44.831 --> 22:46.664
Let's just try it
and see what happens.

22:46.666 --> 22:48.232
What do you think?

22:48.234 --> 22:51.235
Yeah. Just tell me
what to do.

22:51.237 --> 22:53.637
Dude, we're doing
business together.
Love it, man.

22:53.639 --> 22:55.172
Yeah, all right.

22:55.174 --> 22:57.174
This is gonna be
fuckin' exciting, man.

22:57.176 --> 23:00.444
Thanks, Charlie.
Absolutely, dude.

23:00.446 --> 23:02.246
Hey, man. Have you seen
"Bridget Jones' Diary?"

23:02.248 --> 23:04.014
Say again?

23:04.016 --> 23:07.251
$5.00 "Bridget Jones'
Diary." Amazing British
movie, man.

23:07.253 --> 23:10.254
This girl falls in love
with 2 guys. Amazing!

23:10.256 --> 23:11.856
Really funny!

23:11.858 --> 23:14.859
All right, next time,
man. Next time.

23:14.861 --> 23:16.260
Yo, man, your lucky day.

23:16.262 --> 23:18.262
"Bridget Jones'
Amazing Diary."

23:18.264 --> 23:20.264
All right, next
time, man. See you.

23:20.266 --> 23:22.867
See your I.D., please?

23:22.869 --> 23:24.268
You like "Bridget Jones"?

23:24.270 --> 23:26.337
Let's go. I.D. Now.

23:28.707 --> 23:30.274
You're vending within
10 feet of a crosswalk.

23:30.276 --> 23:31.876
You're selling pirated DVDs.

23:31.878 --> 23:34.345
You realize you're
breaking 2 laws at once?

23:39.050 --> 23:43.287
And a fake I.D.
3 for 3 today.

23:43.289 --> 23:45.556
This your real name?

23:45.558 --> 23:47.291
1-Adam to Central.

23:47.293 --> 23:48.893
Go for Central.

23:48.895 --> 23:52.296
Show-me stop 10-10
with a female,
Canal and Broadway.

23:52.298 --> 23:54.899
Requesting NYSPIN check.

23:54.901 --> 23:59.303
Last name Jafari...
Juliet Alpha Foxtrot
Alpha Romeo India.

23:59.305 --> 24:03.908
First name Amira...
D.O.B. is 02/03/87.

24:03.910 --> 24:06.310
Copy. Stand by.

24:06.312 --> 24:08.312
That's 11-99.

24:08.314 --> 24:10.214
Roger. OK, let's go.

24:10.216 --> 24:12.016
What's going on?

24:12.018 --> 24:13.651
Name's in the system.
I gotta bring you in.
Let's go.

24:13.653 --> 24:15.319
OK. OK, OK!
I'm coming!

24:15.321 --> 24:16.987
Let's go!

24:23.496 --> 24:27.932
Oh! What are you doing?
Look! It's a crosswalk!

24:27.934 --> 24:29.400
Hey, stop!

24:43.849 --> 24:46.884
1-Adam Central,
I got an 11-99.

25:11.443 --> 25:13.077
Hey, man.

25:13.079 --> 25:14.378
Hey, Charlie.

25:14.380 --> 25:15.980
How you doing?
Good.

25:15.982 --> 25:17.381
Yeah? How's it coming?

25:17.383 --> 25:18.983
Great.
Good, man.

25:18.985 --> 25:21.385
Looks like you guys
really have the
market beat.

25:21.387 --> 25:27.391
Yeah. Just gotta be
smarter than the next guy,
that's all. Yeah.

25:27.393 --> 25:29.393
I'm so excited we're doing
this together finally.

25:29.395 --> 25:30.995
It's gonna be awesome.

25:30.997 --> 25:32.396
Yeah, thank you so much.

25:32.398 --> 25:33.998
No, of course, man,
of course.

25:34.000 --> 25:39.403
Hey, do you own any
suits or ties
or anything?

25:39.405 --> 25:41.005
No.

25:41.007 --> 25:42.406
OK, so, because
we're in sales,

25:42.408 --> 25:44.408
we gotta look extra sharp.

25:44.410 --> 25:48.145
so I think we should
go out and get you
some really nice ties

25:48.147 --> 25:51.015
and fancy suits
and all that, make you
look like a million bucks.

25:51.017 --> 25:52.416
Cool?
Great.

25:52.418 --> 25:54.018
OK, awesome.
Right. I gotta go.

25:54.020 --> 25:55.419
I'll talk to you in a bit.

25:55.421 --> 25:57.087
Great.

26:08.967 --> 26:10.434
Hello?

26:10.436 --> 26:12.436
Sam?
Yeah. Bassam,
what's up?

26:12.438 --> 26:14.438
Yes. I need your help.

26:14.440 --> 26:16.140
Yeah. What is it?
Anything.

26:16.142 --> 26:18.309
Amira's in trouble.
She had a run-in
with the police.

26:18.311 --> 26:20.044
Is she OK?

26:20.046 --> 26:22.046
I don't know, but
she's at the apartment.

26:22.048 --> 26:24.048
She can't stay there.
They know our address.

26:24.050 --> 26:25.849
And they're looking for her.

26:25.851 --> 26:28.052
She needs a place
to stay.

26:28.054 --> 26:30.134
Bassam, she can stay with me.

26:31.456 --> 26:33.457
Sam, she's my niece.

26:33.459 --> 26:35.459
I need you
to keep her safe.

26:35.461 --> 26:36.994
She's had a lot of
trouble with the courts.

26:36.996 --> 26:38.295
She'll be safe with me.

26:38.297 --> 26:39.897
Where are you right now?

26:39.899 --> 26:42.333
I don't know.
In the middle
of fucking nowhere!

26:42.335 --> 26:44.134
But as soon as
I get back on Sunday,

26:44.136 --> 26:46.203
I'm driving her
to Michigan to live
with my cousin Jaffa.

26:46.205 --> 26:47.471
How soon can you get to her?

26:47.473 --> 26:49.073
I'll leave right now.

26:49.075 --> 26:50.474
Please, Sam,
keep her safe.

26:50.476 --> 26:52.142
Yeah, of course.

27:04.089 --> 27:05.489
Are you OK?

27:05.491 --> 27:07.091
What happened?

27:07.093 --> 27:09.093
I got arrested
for selling DVDs,

27:09.095 --> 27:10.494
and then I ran away.

27:10.496 --> 27:12.162
How'd they get your address?

27:12.164 --> 27:13.564
They took my fake I.D.

27:13.566 --> 27:15.032
You had your real
address on your
fake I.D.?

27:15.034 --> 27:16.500
I wanted it to look real.

27:16.502 --> 27:18.102
Mission accomplished.
That's...

27:18.104 --> 27:19.837
Stupid. I know.

27:23.108 --> 27:26.510
Bassam said that you
had some trouble
with the courts?

27:26.512 --> 27:29.513
Bassam tried to claim me
as a dependent, but
that didn't work out,

27:29.515 --> 27:31.415
so, yes, I have
trouble with the courts.

27:31.417 --> 27:33.117
Can you go back to Iraq?

27:33.119 --> 27:34.885
No. I can never
go back.

27:34.887 --> 27:38.222
It got too dangerous
after my family was
helping Americans.

27:38.224 --> 27:39.923
Bassam told me
about your brother.

27:39.925 --> 27:43.027
Don't talk about
my brother!

27:43.029 --> 27:44.595
I'm sorry.

27:48.533 --> 27:50.067
Look, just go.

27:50.069 --> 27:51.602
I don't want to
go with you.

27:51.604 --> 27:54.071
I understand that,
but I made a promise
to Bassam.

27:54.073 --> 27:55.606
I can look after myself.

27:57.142 --> 27:59.143
Look, you can't stay here.

27:59.145 --> 28:01.545
Finish packing
that bag, and I'll
take you someplace safe.

28:01.547 --> 28:03.547
We'll head out on my bike.

28:03.549 --> 28:05.549
You have a bike?

28:05.551 --> 28:07.117
Like a motorcycle?

28:07.119 --> 28:08.786
Mm-hmm.

28:08.788 --> 28:10.621
Shit.

28:12.157 --> 28:14.117
Look, I'm not leaving
without you.

28:46.591 --> 28:48.592
Fuck.

28:48.594 --> 28:50.661
This is really good.

28:52.197 --> 28:53.664
Oh, my God.

28:59.204 --> 29:00.604
Oh, my God.

29:00.606 --> 29:03.273
This is the best wrap
I've ever had.

29:03.275 --> 29:05.442
I should open,
like, a wrap business.

29:05.444 --> 29:07.277
That's what I could do.

29:07.279 --> 29:08.612
Just need some investors,

29:08.614 --> 29:10.214
open a little shop
on the corner.

29:10.216 --> 29:12.216
You could come in
whenever you want,

29:12.218 --> 29:13.884
watch other people eat wraps.

29:13.886 --> 29:16.687
Are we just gonna sit here
until Bassam gets back?

29:19.224 --> 29:22.226
What do you want to do?
What would you
rather do?

29:22.228 --> 29:24.294
Something better than this.

29:27.232 --> 29:28.632
Better than this?

29:28.634 --> 29:30.367
You haven't tried
the wrap yet.

29:30.369 --> 29:32.269
I'm not going to.
Right.

29:56.261 --> 29:57.661
You OK?
You seem a little uneasy.

29:57.663 --> 29:59.663
I've never been
on a boat before.

29:59.665 --> 30:01.198
Is it safe?

30:01.200 --> 30:02.666
No.

30:02.668 --> 30:04.268
Yeah. It's very safe...

30:04.270 --> 30:06.937
as long as you
stay on the boat.

30:06.939 --> 30:08.572
Why? Are there sharks?

30:08.574 --> 30:10.674
Is that what
you're afraid of?

30:10.676 --> 30:16.113
Yeah. I'm afraid of
drowning and dying and
then being eaten by sharks.

30:18.283 --> 30:20.284
What about pirates?
Are you afraid of pirates?

30:20.286 --> 30:24.688
Ha ha!
I don't know.

30:24.690 --> 30:26.690
Hey, give me your hand.

30:26.692 --> 30:28.292
Why?

30:28.294 --> 30:30.761
Just give me your hand.
Trust me.

30:38.436 --> 30:42.306
You feel that?
You're steering the boat.

30:42.308 --> 30:43.707
You're a sea captain.

30:43.709 --> 30:45.375
OK!

30:46.711 --> 30:48.712
You're doing a good job.

30:48.714 --> 30:51.715
You might want to
stand up so you can see
where you're headed.

30:51.717 --> 30:54.318
Yeah?
Yeah, come on.

30:54.320 --> 30:55.786
OK.

31:00.725 --> 31:02.593
See where I'm
pointing right now?

31:02.595 --> 31:03.827
Yeah.

31:03.829 --> 31:05.329
Dead ahead, that
little spike coming out?

31:05.331 --> 31:06.797
OK.

31:06.799 --> 31:08.999
That's what we're
heading toward.
OK.

31:10.735 --> 31:12.336
There you go.

31:12.338 --> 31:14.338
Ha ha ha!
You're doing great.

31:14.340 --> 31:15.739
Wait. Where are you
going?
Yeah.

31:15.741 --> 31:17.741
No. You are not
going anywhere!

31:17.743 --> 31:19.343
Sam, what are you doing?
Come back.

31:19.345 --> 31:20.611
Lookit. I'm gonna
jump in the water.

31:20.613 --> 31:22.479
What? No, you're not.

31:22.481 --> 31:25.249
You're gonna calmly
turn the boat around
and pick me up, OK?

31:25.251 --> 31:26.750
No, no, I'm not.

31:26.752 --> 31:28.352
You're not gonna
pick me up?

31:28.354 --> 31:30.754
Yes, I would, but
you are not jumping
in the water.

31:30.756 --> 31:32.356
Sam, if you jump
in the water,

31:32.358 --> 31:34.691
I will never, ever
speak to you again.
Ever.

31:34.693 --> 31:35.959
OK.
Sam... Oh, my God.

31:35.961 --> 31:37.261
Sam, I can't believe
you, man.

31:37.263 --> 31:38.528
Oh, my God.

31:38.530 --> 31:39.796
Oh, my God,
I'm losing my balance.

31:39.798 --> 31:41.765
What are you doing?
No, Sam, stop it!

31:41.767 --> 31:44.101
Amira.
Oh, my God.
You are crazy.

31:44.103 --> 31:45.769
What are you doing?

31:45.771 --> 31:47.371
It really
isn't that hard.
Sam, stop it!

31:47.373 --> 31:48.772
Sam! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

31:48.774 --> 31:50.774
Oh, my God, no!

31:50.776 --> 31:52.376
Oh, my God,
Sam!

31:52.378 --> 31:55.379
Oh, my gosh.
Crazy person!

31:55.381 --> 31:56.780
What do you
think you're doing?

31:56.782 --> 31:58.682
Just remain calm.

31:58.684 --> 32:00.784
OK, careful.

32:00.786 --> 32:02.853
OK, keep coming.

32:02.855 --> 32:04.688
I'm going to
hit you, man.

32:04.690 --> 32:06.690
It's OK.
Come toward me.

32:06.692 --> 32:08.158
Careful, Sam.

32:08.160 --> 32:09.393
Amira.
What?

32:09.395 --> 32:11.395
Put the ladder down.
OK.

32:11.397 --> 32:12.829
OK.

32:12.831 --> 32:14.398
It's the latch
on the left side.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.300
OK, OK.
Wait. Watch out.

32:16.302 --> 32:17.801
OK?

32:17.803 --> 32:19.803
Oh, I can't believe you, man.

32:19.805 --> 32:21.471
I did it! Ha ha!

32:21.473 --> 32:22.806
High five, man!

32:22.808 --> 32:24.408
Oh, now you want to high five?

32:24.410 --> 32:26.009
Come on, just give me
a high five!

32:26.011 --> 32:27.411
You're just throwin'
'em out willy nilly?

32:27.413 --> 32:29.333
Just give me a high five!

32:30.515 --> 32:31.882
So cool.

32:34.819 --> 32:36.420
OK.

32:36.422 --> 32:37.821
I'll take it back.

32:37.823 --> 32:39.489
No, no, I got it.

32:39.491 --> 32:41.491
It's my boat.

32:43.494 --> 32:44.895
How far can we go?

32:46.431 --> 32:49.900
As far as you want to.

32:51.437 --> 32:52.836
You found the gas.

32:52.838 --> 32:54.504
Ha ha ha!

33:07.585 --> 33:09.519
Do you do Facebook?

33:10.855 --> 33:12.856
No.

33:12.858 --> 33:14.858
That's too bad.

33:14.860 --> 33:16.860
'Cause I was
thinking if you did,
then...

33:16.862 --> 33:19.930
maybe I would
let you friend me.

33:21.265 --> 33:22.966
Wow.

33:22.968 --> 33:26.436
I have to join
a website just for you
to be friends with me.

33:26.438 --> 33:28.105
It's not the same.

33:28.107 --> 33:30.474
It's like I can look
at all the things
you like,

33:30.476 --> 33:33.477
and then you can
look at all the
things I like,

33:33.479 --> 33:35.479
and then we can poke
each other and stuff.

33:35.481 --> 33:37.481
Oh, you didn't say
anything about poking.

33:37.483 --> 33:39.883
I didn't know Facebook
was about poking.

33:39.885 --> 33:41.551
Forget it.

33:43.888 --> 33:46.957
Let's poke this guy.

33:48.493 --> 33:49.893
It's too late.
We missed our opportunity.

33:49.895 --> 33:51.495
Never mind.

33:51.497 --> 33:52.963
Let's poke the next biker.

33:56.334 --> 33:59.136
Have you ever been
to Michigan before?

33:59.138 --> 34:01.571
No.

34:03.674 --> 34:06.309
Maybe I'll come and visit.

34:06.311 --> 34:10.514
I don't want to
see you again.

34:10.516 --> 34:11.982
Ever.

34:19.524 --> 34:22.659
Ha ha ha!

34:22.661 --> 34:24.928
I'm just fucking
with your asshole.

34:24.929 --> 34:26.530
Ha ha ha!

34:26.532 --> 34:29.933
You're fucking
with my asshole.

34:29.935 --> 34:31.435
I don't think
that's what you meant.

34:31.437 --> 34:32.768
What?

34:32.771 --> 34:34.337
You don't want to do that.

34:34.339 --> 34:36.540
Is that not a thing?
Definitely not, no.

34:36.542 --> 34:39.943
I'm sorry. I don't
understand every single
curse word words.

34:39.945 --> 34:42.012
No, it's OK.
It's just... it's funny.

34:42.014 --> 34:46.049
I'm pretty sure you
don't want to fuck with
someone's asshole.

34:46.051 --> 34:48.952
Unless maybe that's
something you're into.

34:48.954 --> 34:52.621
I don't know you
that well, so... oh.

35:01.966 --> 35:04.034
Thanks.

35:17.982 --> 35:19.583
You take the bed.

35:19.585 --> 35:21.051
OK.

36:03.027 --> 36:05.028
Good night.

36:05.030 --> 36:07.097
Good night.

36:19.644 --> 36:21.278
When's the last time
you tied a tie?

36:21.280 --> 36:22.646
I don't know... prom?

36:22.648 --> 36:23.914
But yeah,
I could tell.

36:23.916 --> 36:25.415
Didn't do it well
then, yeah.

36:25.417 --> 36:26.950
And it's not looking good.

36:26.952 --> 36:28.818
Thank you
for rubbing it in.
I'm sorry, man.

36:28.820 --> 36:30.887
I don't know how to
fucking fix this thing.

36:30.889 --> 36:32.489
Thank you.

36:32.491 --> 36:34.157
Hey, Jack.

36:34.159 --> 36:36.059
How are you,
Charlie?
Doing well. How are you?

36:36.061 --> 36:37.661
Good, thanks.
Good to see you.

36:37.663 --> 36:39.262
Jack Leroy, I'd
like you to meet

36:39.264 --> 36:41.298
the newest member
of our team, my cousin
Sam Seneca.

36:41.300 --> 36:42.999
Sir.
It's a pleasure.

36:43.001 --> 36:46.102
Charlie told me
an awful lot
about you.

36:46.104 --> 36:49.839
Has he? Did he mention
I don't know how to
tie a fucking tie?

36:49.841 --> 36:51.308
Ah. I hate ties.

36:51.310 --> 36:54.277
Oh, thank God.
Let's get rid of this.

36:54.279 --> 36:56.846
So, you guys wanna
have a seat?

36:56.848 --> 36:59.115
Charlie tells me
you were a Green Beret?

36:59.117 --> 37:04.087
I didn't like Berets
either. That's a joke.

37:04.089 --> 37:06.089
I actually really
miss my guys.

37:06.091 --> 37:07.824
What unit were you in?

37:07.826 --> 37:10.160
I was with SAG OP 35.

37:11.696 --> 37:13.797
You must have spent
more time in Laos
than Vietnam.

37:13.799 --> 37:15.165
Yeah?

37:16.701 --> 37:19.102
Yes, I did.

37:19.104 --> 37:21.705
Yeah, about 2 dozen
of us went over
together,

37:21.707 --> 37:24.174
and only a handful
of us made it back.

37:25.977 --> 37:27.477
Thank you for your service.

37:27.479 --> 37:29.045
Thank you for yours.

37:29.047 --> 37:34.384
And I would like
to thank you both
for your service.

37:36.721 --> 37:38.521
Will Sam be handling
my account?

37:38.523 --> 37:40.123
Absolutely,
if that's what
you'd prefer.

37:40.125 --> 37:42.726
Yeah, I would.

37:42.728 --> 37:45.128
You busy tonight?

37:45.130 --> 37:47.130
Uh, no, I'm not.
OK, here.

37:47.132 --> 37:50.133
I think you should
come over to dinner.
What do you say?

37:50.135 --> 37:51.735
It sounds good.

37:51.737 --> 37:53.737
This is my home address.

37:53.739 --> 37:56.139
We'll put away
some cheap food

37:56.141 --> 37:59.142
and some very
expensive scotch,
huh?

37:59.144 --> 38:02.145
That sounds great.
All right, good.

38:02.147 --> 38:04.147
So, uh... Jack,

38:04.149 --> 38:07.083
does this mean we can
count you in for the 10?

38:07.085 --> 38:09.819
Well, I've heard
your spiel a dozen
times,

38:09.821 --> 38:11.755
but I guess I need
to hear it again,

38:11.757 --> 38:16.159
because I'm thinking
more like 25.

38:16.161 --> 38:17.761
Great.

38:17.763 --> 38:19.162
That's great, yeah.

38:19.164 --> 38:20.664
No, Jack,
that's fantastic.

38:20.666 --> 38:24.768
Listen, let me
give you this packet.

38:24.770 --> 38:28.171
It's just investment
philosophy, recent
performance, and the like.

38:28.173 --> 38:30.106
You can take a look at it.

38:32.943 --> 38:35.178
Dude, you're
a fucking natural, man.

38:35.180 --> 38:37.180
It's amazing.
He's so nice.

38:37.182 --> 38:39.182
No. Jack... let me
tell you something.

38:39.184 --> 38:41.184
He's nice to people like you.

38:41.186 --> 38:43.186
See, Jack just needs
somebody he can trust.

38:43.188 --> 38:46.956
And with your background,
it's literally the
perfect combination.

38:46.958 --> 38:49.793
Jules, can you get me
Lawrence on the line,
please?

38:49.795 --> 38:51.961
I keep trying his cell
and he's not picking up.

38:51.963 --> 38:53.797
Thank you.

38:53.799 --> 38:55.865
All right, man,
so, listen.

38:55.867 --> 38:58.201
I know that I said
I would cut you
a check for 50K

38:58.203 --> 38:59.803
if he went in for 10.

38:59.805 --> 39:01.137
But since he's
going in for 25,

39:01.139 --> 39:02.405
I'm cutting you
a check for 100.

39:02.407 --> 39:04.140
You're shittin' me.

39:04.142 --> 39:06.810
No. I ain't shittin'
you. I'm giving you
100K.

39:06.812 --> 39:08.211
That's amazing.

39:08.213 --> 39:10.213
And, by the way,
I want you to come

39:10.215 --> 39:12.415
to my engagement
party this weekend.

39:12.417 --> 39:13.983
I didn't know you were
having an engagement party.

39:13.985 --> 39:15.285
I know.
Claire fucked up.

39:15.287 --> 39:16.820
You should have been
on the invite list.

39:16.822 --> 39:18.288
I've no idea
why you weren't.

39:18.290 --> 39:19.823
But all my biggest
clients are
gonna be there,

39:19.825 --> 39:21.224
and I want to
show you off.

39:21.226 --> 39:23.059
I'll be there.
Awesome, awesome.

39:23.061 --> 39:25.228
So, question:

39:25.230 --> 39:27.897
Um... can you wear
your uniform?

39:29.834 --> 39:31.301
I'm not in the Army
anymore.

39:31.303 --> 39:33.069
Right. No, no,
I know, I know,

39:33.071 --> 39:35.839
but there has to be
like a grace period
or some shit, right,

39:35.841 --> 39:38.141
where you can
wear it to formal
events or something?

39:38.143 --> 39:39.509
No?

39:39.511 --> 39:43.847
I mean, I've only
been out a month or so.

39:43.849 --> 39:46.249
And I am on terminal leave,
so, technically
I could wear it.

39:46.251 --> 39:47.851
Exactly, so...

39:47.853 --> 39:49.319
so do you mind?

39:51.255 --> 39:52.789
No.
Awesome!

39:52.791 --> 39:54.758
Dude, it's gonna be
fucking awesome!

39:54.760 --> 39:56.259
You're gonna finally
meet Simone, who's been
asking about you.

39:56.261 --> 39:57.861
Lawrence is
on the line for you.

39:57.863 --> 40:00.697
Oh, shit. OK, yeah,
tell him to hold
for a sec.

40:00.699 --> 40:03.266
Tonight, after your
dinner with Jack,

40:03.268 --> 40:05.268
I wanna take you out
for a drink, man.

40:05.270 --> 40:07.270
I think we should
celebrate, just get
fuckin' hammered.

40:07.272 --> 40:10.273
All right, dude.
Thank you so much
for this opportunity.

40:10.275 --> 40:12.275
No, dude, thank you,
man. You killed it,
all right?

40:12.277 --> 40:13.877
I appreciate it.

40:13.879 --> 40:15.278
No, man, seriously.
You nailed it,
all right?

40:15.280 --> 40:16.880
Good work, dude.

40:16.882 --> 40:18.282
Good work.
I'll see you
tonight, man.

40:18.283 --> 40:20.350
Have fun over there.

40:21.886 --> 40:25.388
Hey, man.
We got it. Yeah.

41:01.325 --> 41:03.393
Ha ha ha!

41:06.230 --> 41:08.932
I sneak out the back,
hoping nobody notices.

41:08.934 --> 41:10.934
And I walk over
to this cliff,

41:10.936 --> 41:13.102
'cause they don't have
fucking bathrooms there.

41:13.104 --> 41:15.271
I walk right to the edge,
and I'm about to piss,

41:15.273 --> 41:19.008
and I just hear this guy
scream, "Don't do it, man!

41:19.010 --> 41:20.777
"You've got your whole life
ahead of you!

41:20.779 --> 41:22.345
Allah loves you!"

41:22.347 --> 41:25.782
Ha ha ha! Don't jump!

41:25.784 --> 41:28.551
Oh. I guess Allah did,
'cause I didn't jump.

41:28.553 --> 41:30.353
Oh, my God.

41:30.355 --> 41:34.357
Oh, pretty fuckin'
funny. Ha ha ha.

41:34.359 --> 41:36.359
Oh, this is great.

41:36.361 --> 41:37.794
Thank you
for inviting me over.

41:37.796 --> 41:39.362
Oh...

41:39.364 --> 41:41.698
I appreciate it,
just shootin' the shit.

41:41.700 --> 41:43.433
Yeah, of course.

41:44.969 --> 41:46.369
I miss this.

41:46.371 --> 41:49.372
Absolutely. Absolutely.

41:52.610 --> 41:55.979
We were on this
routine patrol
one morning.

41:55.981 --> 41:59.983
It's in the north,
right on the
Cambodian border.

41:59.985 --> 42:03.987
And we came across
this... what appeared to
be a deserted village.

42:03.989 --> 42:05.989
There was nobody there,

42:05.991 --> 42:09.993
but I could hear
what I thought was...

42:09.995 --> 42:12.896
sounded like a child singing.

42:12.898 --> 42:15.398
And...

42:15.400 --> 42:19.068
First I thought
the voice was maybe
just in my head,

42:19.070 --> 42:25.008
but as I got closer
to this hut,

42:25.010 --> 42:28.011
the singing
got louder and louder

42:28.013 --> 42:32.015
until...

42:32.017 --> 42:37.420
I opened up the door
of this hut and...

42:37.422 --> 42:39.022
there was this
beautiful little girl.

42:39.024 --> 42:41.424
She was about 6 years old,

42:41.426 --> 42:46.429
and she was holding
the hand of her
dead mother.

42:46.431 --> 42:49.432
And...

42:49.434 --> 42:51.034
she was just
singing and singing,

42:51.036 --> 42:56.039
and she had this
huge smile on her face.

42:56.041 --> 42:58.107
And I just...

43:01.445 --> 43:03.813
I just stared at her.

43:03.815 --> 43:07.450
Finally, she looked up
at me, and our eyes met.

43:07.452 --> 43:09.118
And...

43:11.455 --> 43:14.123
she just kept singing.

43:20.064 --> 43:21.531
I can't...

43:23.067 --> 43:25.068
Well...

43:31.241 --> 43:33.910
Thank you.

43:33.912 --> 43:37.080
Oh, yeah.

43:37.082 --> 43:38.548
Wow.

43:43.187 --> 43:44.487
I don't know what
I would have done.

43:44.489 --> 43:47.090
Oh! Just talkin'
about you, man.

43:47.092 --> 43:50.259
How you doin', brother?
You remember Greg, right?

43:50.261 --> 43:52.495
Hug it out.
Hug it out.

43:52.497 --> 43:54.097
That's some good shit
right there.

43:54.099 --> 43:55.698
We were just braggin'
about you earlier today.

43:55.700 --> 43:57.100
You were?

43:57.102 --> 43:58.501
I was fuckin' braggin'
about you, man.

43:58.503 --> 44:00.169
I did a little research.

44:00.171 --> 44:01.904
You have any idea
how many goddamn funds
are run by vets?

44:01.906 --> 44:04.374
We are gonna make
so much fuckin' money,
you and I.

44:04.376 --> 44:06.109
We're gonna make
a fuckload of money, man.

44:06.111 --> 44:07.677
You guys are
the Dynamic Duo.

44:07.679 --> 44:09.779
We're the fuckin'
Dynamic Duo here.

44:09.781 --> 44:11.514
I don't want to be Robin.

44:11.516 --> 44:14.517
Dude, I'm Batman.
So, you got a fuckin' choice.

44:14.519 --> 44:16.786
Can we be another Duo?

44:16.788 --> 44:18.521
All right, I gotta take a piss.

44:18.523 --> 44:20.189
See you guys inside, yeah?

44:20.191 --> 44:22.125
All right.

44:22.127 --> 44:25.294
You are a lucky man,
getting in on
Charlie's action,

44:25.296 --> 44:27.263
I'll tell you.

44:27.265 --> 44:29.532
It looks like
he's gonna get through
without a scratch, too.

44:29.534 --> 44:31.768
Get through what
without a scratch?

44:31.770 --> 44:35.138
Oh, just all the fuckin'
bullshit. He's dealin'
with the SCC, you know.

44:35.140 --> 44:36.540
This investigation
is such bullshit.

44:36.541 --> 44:38.141
Anyway, it's nothin'.

44:38.143 --> 44:40.143
What do you mean?
What investigation?

44:40.145 --> 44:43.146
Oh, no, no.
Honestly, don't even...
get it out of your head.

44:43.148 --> 44:45.548
Just like... bluhhh!
It's really nothing.

44:45.550 --> 44:49.552
It's just they're
worried he's overvaluing
some of his assets...

44:49.554 --> 44:51.254
That sounds like something.

44:51.256 --> 44:54.557
No, no, that's standard
practice in hedge funds,
so...

44:54.559 --> 44:56.726
What the fuck!
We gotta go inside!

44:56.728 --> 44:59.429
Sorry, I didn't know
we were even going
to a strip club, so...

44:59.431 --> 45:00.997
This isn't my scene.

45:00.999 --> 45:04.167
Ah, no, no, no.
Come on. You're
Captain America.

45:04.169 --> 45:07.170
There's a roomful of
trim would pay to fuck
a war hero like you,

45:07.172 --> 45:08.571
or at least give you
a discount, you know?

45:08.573 --> 45:10.406
I'm OK, thanks.

45:10.408 --> 45:13.576
No, no, no. Come on,
let me buy you one lap
dance, at least, hmm?

45:13.578 --> 45:16.579
Strip clubs give me flashbacks.

45:16.581 --> 45:18.181
There were a lot of them
in the war.

45:18.183 --> 45:19.582
They bombed us with strippers.

45:19.584 --> 45:22.185
Really?
Sorry. Greg.

45:22.187 --> 45:23.986
You're leavin'?
I'm gonna go.

45:23.988 --> 45:25.755
What? Are we cool?

45:25.757 --> 45:28.357
Yeah, we're cool.
Can you tell Charlie
I said good-bye?

45:28.359 --> 45:30.593
Yeah, yes. Yeah.

45:30.595 --> 45:33.196
Good, great.
I'll do that.

45:33.198 --> 45:34.597
Enjoy the booty.

45:34.599 --> 45:38.267
All right, I'll...
fo shizzle. Ha ha!

46:28.652 --> 46:30.653
You should sleep
on the bed.

46:30.655 --> 46:32.655
I'm OK, thank you.

46:32.657 --> 46:34.657
No, really.
It's your home.

46:34.659 --> 46:37.260
You should sleep on the bed.

46:37.262 --> 46:39.662
I'm OK here.
I like the floor.

47:03.687 --> 47:05.688
This is ridiculous.

47:05.690 --> 47:07.557
You're being ridiculous.

47:07.559 --> 47:11.294
I am on the floor
because that's the
chivalrous thing to do.

47:11.296 --> 47:13.696
I'm fine, seriously.

47:13.698 --> 47:15.698
Go to your bed.

47:15.700 --> 47:17.600
I'm in my bed.

47:17.602 --> 47:19.368
This is my bed.

47:24.308 --> 47:25.708
Look, if no one's
gonna sleep in
the bed,

47:25.710 --> 47:27.310
I will sleep in the bed.

47:27.312 --> 47:28.778
Great.

47:33.717 --> 47:35.384
All right.

47:41.325 --> 47:43.392
This is so stupid.

47:50.734 --> 47:52.802
Here. Come up
on the bed.

47:55.739 --> 48:00.843
I've saved you... 60%.

48:00.845 --> 48:03.346
You're worried
that something's
gonna happen?

48:03.348 --> 48:05.748
I know nothing will happen.

48:05.750 --> 48:07.817
Exactly.

48:11.822 --> 48:13.623
What, do you think
I'm attracted to you
or something?

48:13.625 --> 48:16.425
Nope.

48:16.427 --> 48:18.794
No, you've made it
abundantly clear

48:18.796 --> 48:20.796
that you're not
attracted to me.

48:20.798 --> 48:22.698
Good.

48:24.201 --> 48:26.836
So you can come up
on the bed whenever.

48:50.727 --> 48:52.461
What's wrong?

48:57.401 --> 48:59.869
Ahem. Just thinking.

49:01.972 --> 49:03.806
About what?

49:03.808 --> 49:05.875
Nothing important.

49:07.411 --> 49:09.412
You're lying.

49:09.414 --> 49:11.881
I can read your mind.

49:13.817 --> 49:17.820
Good, good. If you
can read my mind, then...

49:17.822 --> 49:19.422
you already know
what I'm thinking?

49:19.424 --> 49:21.357
Yes.
Good.

49:21.359 --> 49:25.428
You're thinking, "How
can I keep this secret
away from Amira."

49:25.430 --> 49:27.830
Right?
Mmm, no. Mm-mmm.

49:27.832 --> 49:29.899
Just tell me
what's going on.

49:35.238 --> 49:38.441
Just worried about...

49:38.443 --> 49:39.842
stu... I don't know.

49:39.844 --> 49:41.444
This...

49:41.446 --> 49:45.514
This job is stressful,
this new job.

49:45.516 --> 49:49.285
Yeah, Wall Street is stressful.

49:49.287 --> 49:51.520
I've seen those movies.

49:53.857 --> 49:56.859
Is that what you
always wanted to do?

49:56.861 --> 49:59.862
Never crossed my mind.

49:59.864 --> 50:01.931
What did you want to do?

50:07.871 --> 50:12.541
When I was a kid,
I was always the one
making other kids laugh,

50:12.543 --> 50:14.877
telling funny stories,

50:14.879 --> 50:18.481
thought I wanted to be
a comedian,

50:18.483 --> 50:21.484
like a stand-up comedian.

50:21.486 --> 50:23.886
You know those?

50:23.888 --> 50:26.555
Yes.
OK.

50:27.891 --> 50:30.493
Did you ever try it?

50:30.495 --> 50:32.495
Yeah, I tried it once.

50:32.497 --> 50:33.896
And?

50:33.898 --> 50:35.898
I bombed.

50:35.900 --> 50:38.267
Is "bombed" good or bad?

50:38.269 --> 50:39.902
Bombed is bad.

50:39.904 --> 50:41.504
Oh.

50:41.506 --> 50:42.972
In my case, very bad.

50:45.509 --> 50:47.176
Killed is good.

50:48.912 --> 50:51.914
So, you want to kill,
not bomb.

50:51.916 --> 50:53.516
Yeah.

50:53.518 --> 50:55.518
That's weird, man.

50:55.520 --> 50:58.921
Yeah, usually one
leads to the other,

50:58.923 --> 51:00.523
but not in this case.

51:00.525 --> 51:03.526
Well, you should try it again.

51:03.528 --> 51:07.630
Yeah, right... coming
from the girl who
hates my stories.

51:07.632 --> 51:09.532
Yeah, I do.

51:09.534 --> 51:11.801
I think I'll get
a second opinion.

51:11.803 --> 51:13.936
No, I just...

51:13.938 --> 51:15.538
I found that
book of yours,

51:15.540 --> 51:16.939
the one with
the jokes in it,

51:16.941 --> 51:18.941
and... they're funny.

51:18.943 --> 51:20.543
You did what?

51:20.545 --> 51:21.944
I just found it.

51:21.946 --> 51:23.546
You were looking
through my book?

51:23.548 --> 51:25.548
You left it out
in the open.
Nosy.

51:25.550 --> 51:26.949
I left it out
in the open
in my own home?

51:26.951 --> 51:28.551
Yes, it was there,
and I...

51:28.553 --> 51:30.553
In my home, I left
a book out in the open.

51:30.555 --> 51:33.556
Yes.
My private...

51:33.558 --> 51:34.957
Didn't say "Private"
or anything.

51:34.959 --> 51:37.359
I didn't leave it on
a park bench.

51:37.361 --> 51:38.961
You're right,
you're right.

51:38.963 --> 51:40.963
I should have written
"Private" on it.

51:40.965 --> 51:42.565
Yep. Next time.
It's my fault...

51:42.567 --> 51:44.200
It is your fault.

51:44.202 --> 51:48.070
for expecting you
not to just rifle
through my stuff.

51:48.072 --> 51:49.572
OK, look, I just said
it was funny.

51:49.574 --> 51:51.974
I'm silly.
I was giving you
a compliment.

51:51.976 --> 51:54.043
Thank you.
Yeah, you're welcome.

52:00.517 --> 52:03.486
Hey, I told you
something personal
about me.

52:03.488 --> 52:05.988
So, you should do that.

52:05.990 --> 52:07.590
What?

52:07.592 --> 52:09.592
You should tell me
something personal
about you,

52:09.594 --> 52:11.594
like, are you bald
under that thing?

52:11.596 --> 52:13.062
Do you shower in it?

52:14.598 --> 52:16.665
Do you shave your pits?
What?

52:16.667 --> 52:18.000
I don't know,
is that an Arab thing?

52:18.002 --> 52:20.002
What?
That's a French thing.

52:20.004 --> 52:21.604
You're so strange.

52:21.606 --> 52:24.340
Tell me something
I'd never guess about you.

52:26.009 --> 52:28.077
Sometimes
I punch people.

52:29.613 --> 52:31.013
What?

52:31.015 --> 52:35.084
When I get mad,
sometimes I punch
people.

52:37.020 --> 52:40.055
That's something you
should know about me.

52:40.057 --> 52:42.691
Yeah, well, sometimes
people deserve it.

52:42.693 --> 52:44.026
Yes.

52:44.028 --> 52:47.630
So, you only...

52:47.632 --> 52:49.632
you don't do it
very often, do you?

52:49.634 --> 52:52.034
No. Just when
they deserve it.

52:52.036 --> 52:54.036
Yeah. Good.
Mm-hmm.

52:54.038 --> 52:56.105
Good. That's good.
Yeah, who...

52:58.642 --> 53:01.110
Sometimes I punch people.

53:03.647 --> 53:06.182
We have something
in common.

53:09.653 --> 53:11.120
What's going on?

53:12.656 --> 53:16.058
This is what I do
to my friends.

53:16.060 --> 53:19.662
So, now we're friends.

53:19.664 --> 53:21.130
Like it.

53:27.604 --> 53:31.073
As long as we're sharing...

53:31.075 --> 53:35.678
you want to know
what I do with my friends?

53:35.680 --> 53:37.146
What?

53:41.818 --> 53:43.152
That's pretty cool.

53:44.688 --> 53:49.358
Yeah, my friends really dig it.

53:49.360 --> 53:51.160
Yeah.

53:53.163 --> 53:55.097
Do your friends like this?

53:55.099 --> 53:56.765
What?

54:03.707 --> 54:06.709
Ahem. Yeah, they
probably would like that

54:06.711 --> 54:08.811
if, uh...

54:08.813 --> 54:11.413
Yeah, I don't know if
they've ever done anything
like that before.

54:13.717 --> 54:18.120
I'll have to ask them,
and we'll take a poll.

54:18.122 --> 54:20.122
You know what
they really like?

54:20.124 --> 54:22.124
What?

54:22.126 --> 54:23.792
This.

54:26.730 --> 54:28.197
Oh! Come on!

54:42.145 --> 54:43.746
No, no, stop.

54:43.748 --> 54:46.148
Oh, sorry.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

54:46.150 --> 54:47.750
No, I'm more sorry.

54:47.752 --> 54:50.152
No, I'm the sorriest.

54:50.154 --> 54:52.588
Unh!

54:52.590 --> 54:54.256
Sorry.

54:54.258 --> 54:56.158
I'm sorry. I'm supposed
to be taking care of you.

54:56.160 --> 54:57.593
This isn't part of that.

54:57.595 --> 54:59.061
No. I...

54:59.063 --> 55:00.362
This is inappropriate.

55:00.364 --> 55:02.765
Are you mad at me?
No.

55:02.767 --> 55:04.166
Are you mad at me?

55:04.168 --> 55:06.168
No.

55:06.170 --> 55:07.836
Good.

55:10.774 --> 55:12.841
I'm not a virgin,
you know.

55:15.945 --> 55:18.247
I'm not a virgin either.

55:29.526 --> 55:31.193
How you guys doing today?

55:31.195 --> 55:34.196
Good. How are you?
Good, good. Name?

55:34.198 --> 55:35.864
Sam Seneca.

55:37.200 --> 55:40.202
Sgt. Seneca
and Amira Jafari?

55:40.204 --> 55:41.804
Have a good time.

55:41.806 --> 55:43.806
Thank you.
Thank you.

55:43.808 --> 55:45.207
You're a sergeant?
I was.

55:45.209 --> 55:48.210
Charlie thinks I'm
still in the Army.

55:48.212 --> 55:50.145
That's weird.

55:50.147 --> 55:52.214
Best dressed man here.

55:52.216 --> 55:54.216
Hey, Sammy,
you look great.

55:54.218 --> 55:56.318
You must be Amira.
Yes.

55:56.320 --> 55:58.787
Hi, I'm Charlie.
It's nice to meet you.

55:58.789 --> 56:00.222
It's nice to meet you, too.

56:00.224 --> 56:02.224
Congratulations
on getting engaged.

56:02.226 --> 56:05.828
This is like the most
romantic thing I've
ever seen in person.

56:05.830 --> 56:07.229
Thank you,
thank you very much.

56:07.231 --> 56:08.831
Hey, Sammy,
someone I want you
to meet.

56:08.833 --> 56:10.232
Oh, yeah, your fiancee?

56:10.234 --> 56:12.234
No, no. Karl, excuse me.

56:12.236 --> 56:15.237
Sam, I want you to
meet Karl Royce,
former Marine.

56:15.239 --> 56:16.839
No such thing
as a former Marine.

56:16.841 --> 56:18.240
Once a Marine
always a Marine.

56:18.242 --> 56:19.842
Yes, yes, of course.

56:19.844 --> 56:21.810
I want you to meet
Sgt. Sam Seneca.

56:21.812 --> 56:24.012
This is my cousin
and also my newest
sales rep.

56:24.014 --> 56:25.481
It's a pleasure to meet you.

56:25.483 --> 56:27.116
Sergeant.
Sir.

56:27.118 --> 56:29.184
Karl owns the
nation's largest
shipping company,

56:29.186 --> 56:30.853
and I thought maybe
you guys could,

56:30.855 --> 56:33.255
I don't know, talk
shop or something.

56:33.257 --> 56:35.524
Gladly. Do you mind
if we get a drink first?

56:35.526 --> 56:37.259
We just got here.
Of course.

56:37.261 --> 56:39.094
You know what, I can
get you guys a drink.

56:39.096 --> 56:40.863
Oh, no, that's OK.
You have a lot of
people to entertain.

56:40.865 --> 56:42.364
Karl, it was
a pleasure
to meet you.

56:42.366 --> 56:43.866
Sergeant.

56:43.868 --> 56:45.934
All right,
we'll talk later.

56:48.271 --> 56:50.339
Yeah, he's a great salesman.

56:51.875 --> 56:53.275
Two whiskeys, neat.

56:53.277 --> 56:55.677
Sam?
Hello.

56:55.679 --> 56:57.880
Claire?
Yes.

56:57.882 --> 57:00.282
Wow.

57:00.284 --> 57:01.884
What a pleasure
to finally meet you.

57:01.886 --> 57:03.285
Same here.

57:03.287 --> 57:04.887
Congratulations.

57:04.889 --> 57:07.289
I know,
already 5 months.

57:07.291 --> 57:09.324
And you must be Amaya.

57:09.326 --> 57:10.959
Amira.

57:10.961 --> 57:13.829
Oh, right. Sorry.
Pleasure.

57:13.831 --> 57:15.464
Thanks for having us.

57:15.466 --> 57:17.346
Well, what do you think?

57:19.169 --> 57:21.303
Well, I think Charlie's
doing all right.

57:21.305 --> 57:23.305
Oh, he is.
He really is.

57:23.307 --> 57:24.907
Yeah.

57:24.909 --> 57:26.308
You know, there is
somebody here

57:26.310 --> 57:29.311
that you absolutely
have to meet.

57:29.313 --> 57:31.914
Simone!
Oh, boy.

57:31.916 --> 57:36.151
Simone, this is
Charlie's cousin Sam.

57:36.153 --> 57:38.320
Yes, Sam, I've heard
so much about you.

57:38.322 --> 57:39.922
Likewise.

57:39.924 --> 57:41.323
It's wonderful to meet you.

57:41.325 --> 57:42.991
My pleasure.

57:45.328 --> 57:47.262
I'm Amira.
Sorry.

57:47.264 --> 57:50.032
I didn't know
you were bringing
a date.

57:50.034 --> 57:51.333
I... well, no.
We're friends.

57:51.335 --> 57:52.935
I'm a prostitute.

57:52.937 --> 57:54.336
Or that.

57:54.338 --> 57:55.838
I beg your pardon?

57:55.840 --> 57:57.339
He even bought
me this dress,

57:57.341 --> 57:59.341
just like
"Pretty Woman."

57:59.343 --> 58:01.543
Right. Ahem.
She looks good in red.

58:01.545 --> 58:04.046
Um, it was nice
to meet you both.

58:04.048 --> 58:05.614
Yeah, Claire,
it was really a pleasure.

58:05.616 --> 58:09.418
I'm sure we'll catch up
a little bit later.

58:09.420 --> 58:11.753
What the fuck
has got into you?

58:11.755 --> 58:13.355
Ha ha ha!

58:13.357 --> 58:15.891
I've never tried
whiskey before.

58:15.893 --> 58:19.361
Yeah, well, there's
a first for everything.

58:19.363 --> 58:21.363
It's really good,

58:21.365 --> 58:23.365
put a little hair on your chest.

58:23.367 --> 58:25.434
What?

58:28.137 --> 58:29.972
Puts hair on your chest.

58:29.974 --> 58:32.374
Whiskey makes hair
grow on your chest.

58:32.376 --> 58:33.976
For real?

58:33.978 --> 58:36.378
Whiskey makes hair
grow on your chest, yeah.

58:36.380 --> 58:38.380
I'm just fucking
with your asshole.

58:38.382 --> 58:42.384
Oh ho ho! Look who's
taking my words now,
huh?

58:42.386 --> 58:45.988
They're not words.
You can't own words.

58:45.990 --> 58:47.389
And it works when I say it.

58:47.391 --> 58:48.991
When you say it.

58:48.993 --> 58:51.059
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

58:53.129 --> 58:54.396
It's good.

59:04.007 --> 59:05.474
I should talk to Charlie.

59:07.010 --> 59:10.012
Go. I'll be OK.

59:13.017 --> 59:16.418
You're a prostitute,
right, so you do
whatever I want?

59:16.420 --> 59:18.020
Right.

59:18.022 --> 59:22.024
Hmm. How about a kiss
on the cheek?

59:22.026 --> 59:24.326
That will cost you an
extra hundred dollars.

59:24.328 --> 59:26.428
Oh, my God!

59:26.430 --> 59:30.432
Let's go.
I think I can afford it.

59:30.434 --> 59:32.434
No, wait. This cheek.

59:32.436 --> 59:35.504
No, no, this one.
Come on.

59:46.282 --> 59:47.549
She is...
5 months along?

59:47.551 --> 59:49.051
Man, she looks amazing
for 5 months.

59:49.053 --> 59:50.452
Yeah, I know.

59:50.454 --> 59:52.220
Charlie.
Hey.
Dude.

59:52.222 --> 59:53.689
What, uh...

59:53.691 --> 59:56.458
What's the name
of Aladdin's girlfriend?

59:56.460 --> 59:58.060
I don't know.

59:58.062 --> 59:59.461
Your girl looks just like her.

59:59.463 --> 01:00:01.964
She does,
actually.
Right?

01:00:01.966 --> 01:00:04.800
I'm gonna ask around.
I'm gonna find out.

01:00:06.469 --> 01:00:08.070
Having fun?

01:00:08.072 --> 01:00:09.471
Yeah. Charlie,
can I talk to you
for a second?

01:00:09.473 --> 01:00:11.073
Yeah.

01:00:11.075 --> 01:00:12.474
In private.

01:00:12.476 --> 01:00:15.077
Uh... sure. Now?

01:00:15.079 --> 01:00:17.145
Come on. Over there?

01:00:19.082 --> 01:00:20.482
Hi! How are you?

01:00:20.484 --> 01:00:22.084
What's up, man?

01:00:22.086 --> 01:00:24.886
I don't know.
I just...

01:00:24.888 --> 01:00:27.556
I just wanna talk
some things through
with you.

01:00:27.558 --> 01:00:29.291
OK, OK, what's up?

01:00:31.094 --> 01:00:33.495
Why are you being
investigated by
the SCC?

01:00:33.497 --> 01:00:35.497
Why am I being... what?

01:00:35.499 --> 01:00:37.099
What are you talking...
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:00:37.101 --> 01:00:40.035
Charlie, just tell me.
Just tell me.

01:00:40.037 --> 01:00:43.372
Sammy, I literally
have no idea what
you're talking about.

01:00:43.374 --> 01:00:45.507
I know when someone's
lying to me, Charlie,
please.

01:00:45.509 --> 01:00:48.276
Hold on one second.
I'm not doing anything
differently

01:00:48.278 --> 01:00:50.112
than what any other
traitor is doing.

01:00:50.114 --> 01:00:51.913
I know the SCC
is investigating you.

01:00:51.915 --> 01:00:53.849
What I don't know
is what you've done
to warrant it.

01:00:53.851 --> 01:00:55.350
All right...
Please.

01:00:55.352 --> 01:00:56.952
OK.

01:00:56.954 --> 01:01:00.022
What you probably
heard about... somewhere...

01:01:00.024 --> 01:01:03.125
I don't know how...
is that the SCC has
an ongoing investigation

01:01:03.127 --> 01:01:04.527
with certain members
of the company.

01:01:04.528 --> 01:01:06.128
Right.
Yeah, OK.

01:01:06.130 --> 01:01:07.529
That's normal.
That happens to
every company

01:01:07.531 --> 01:01:09.264
at one point or another.

01:01:09.266 --> 01:01:11.133
Nothing is happening.
They're not gonna
find anything.

01:01:11.135 --> 01:01:12.534
You're being crazy.
Come on, man.

01:01:12.536 --> 01:01:14.202
You're at my engagement party.

01:01:14.204 --> 01:01:15.537
Can we enjoy ourselves
a little bit, please?

01:01:15.539 --> 01:01:17.606
You know?
I don't know.

01:01:17.608 --> 01:01:19.141
Come on,
let's get out there.

01:01:19.143 --> 01:01:20.609
I'm your cousin, dude.

01:01:26.315 --> 01:01:29.618
I'll have another.
Loved this. Yes.

01:01:33.556 --> 01:01:36.558
Do they...
make you wear that?

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:39.161
This?
Mm-hmm.

01:01:39.163 --> 01:01:41.830
No. I do what I want.

01:01:43.566 --> 01:01:45.233
Thank you.

01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:00.115
Give me a hug,
you crazy fuck!

01:02:00.117 --> 01:02:02.184
Uncle Nick.

01:02:02.186 --> 01:02:04.586
So, you couldn't
cut it in the Army,

01:02:04.588 --> 01:02:07.189
so you're gonna hang out
with the big boys
on Wall Street, huh?

01:02:07.191 --> 01:02:10.592
Yeah, I thought I'd
give it a try.

01:02:10.594 --> 01:02:12.260
It's been a long time.

01:02:12.262 --> 01:02:15.197
Mmm. A long time.

01:02:15.199 --> 01:02:16.719
You know, we missed you
at the funeral.

01:02:18.201 --> 01:02:19.601
You know, uh...

01:02:19.603 --> 01:02:21.603
your dad and I,
we had our differences.

01:02:21.605 --> 01:02:23.205
I don't know what it was.

01:02:23.207 --> 01:02:24.606
We just never saw
eye-to-eye.

01:02:24.608 --> 01:02:26.208
Yeah.

01:02:26.210 --> 01:02:28.610
So...

01:02:28.612 --> 01:02:30.979
What's with
the red dress? Hmm?

01:02:30.981 --> 01:02:32.647
Hmm.

01:02:32.649 --> 01:02:35.050
I mean, haven't you
done enough for
those people?

01:02:35.052 --> 01:02:39.221
I was in building
number 4 when the
planes hit the towers.

01:02:39.223 --> 01:02:42.224
I saw those poor
fuckers jump out
the window,

01:02:42.226 --> 01:02:43.625
smash into the pavement.

01:02:43.627 --> 01:02:45.393
I lost 3 of my closest
friends that day.

01:02:45.395 --> 01:02:46.695
I know, Nick.

01:02:46.697 --> 01:02:49.231
You know what I learned?

01:02:49.233 --> 01:02:51.633
That a towel
is not a fucking hat.

01:02:51.635 --> 01:02:53.635
What do you want her
to do, take it off?

01:02:53.637 --> 01:02:55.303
Yeah,
she's making people
uncomfortable.

01:02:55.305 --> 01:02:57.305
Maybe people are making
her uncomfortable.

01:02:57.307 --> 01:02:59.241
Maybe you're
making her uncomfortable.

01:02:59.243 --> 01:03:01.409
Is she here illegally?

01:03:01.411 --> 01:03:04.646
It's America.
We're all here illegally.

01:03:04.648 --> 01:03:06.248
Hey.

01:03:06.250 --> 01:03:08.250
I got it.

01:03:08.252 --> 01:03:09.651
What is it, Greg?

01:03:09.653 --> 01:03:11.052
It's Jasmine.

01:03:11.054 --> 01:03:12.354
What's Jasmine?

01:03:12.356 --> 01:03:14.256
Aladdin's girlfriend.

01:03:14.258 --> 01:03:15.857
It's Jasmine.

01:03:15.859 --> 01:03:18.226
I love that movie.

01:03:18.228 --> 01:03:19.661
Oh, hey, Sammy,
Sammy, Sammy.

01:03:19.663 --> 01:03:21.263
Let's talk to Karl
for a minute.

01:03:21.265 --> 01:03:22.664
Not now.
Just 5 minutes.
5 minutes.

01:03:22.666 --> 01:03:24.666
Hey, Karl. Sorry to
interrupt, guys.

01:03:24.668 --> 01:03:26.668
Sam's back. I thought
you guys could chat.

01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:28.670
Sergeant, you still
in service?

01:03:28.672 --> 01:03:30.272
No, sir.

01:03:30.274 --> 01:03:32.407
Then why are you
wearing your uniform?

01:03:33.876 --> 01:03:36.678
That's a good question.
That is a good question.

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:40.215
Charlie, why am I
wearing my uniform?

01:03:40.217 --> 01:03:43.285
I think it's because
Charlie thinks I'm
his little pet monkey.

01:03:43.287 --> 01:03:47.689
Well. I think you two
need to talk.

01:03:47.691 --> 01:03:49.257
It was nice to
meet you, Sergeant.

01:03:49.259 --> 01:03:50.692
You as well.

01:03:50.694 --> 01:03:52.294
What the fuck are you doing?

01:03:52.296 --> 01:03:53.695
You just completely
embarrassed me.

01:03:53.697 --> 01:03:55.297
I'm not your little
puppet, Charlie.

01:03:55.299 --> 01:03:56.798
No. What are you doing?
Are you drunk?

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:58.466
Is that
what's happening?
Are you drunk?

01:03:58.468 --> 01:04:00.702
I don't want to do this.
I don't want to do this.

01:04:00.704 --> 01:04:02.304
You don't want to do what?

01:04:02.306 --> 01:04:03.705
What don't you want to do?

01:04:03.707 --> 01:04:05.373
This. I don't...
I don't...

01:04:05.375 --> 01:04:07.309
Charlie,
drop Jack's account.

01:04:07.311 --> 01:04:09.711
Sammy, Jack is coming
in on Tuesday.

01:04:09.713 --> 01:04:11.713
This is a fuckin' check
for $25 million,

01:04:11.715 --> 01:04:13.448
and I need you there to close.

01:04:13.450 --> 01:04:14.716
I am tired of being lied to.

01:04:14.718 --> 01:04:16.918
Who the fuck
is lying to you?
You are.

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:18.320
Sam, hey, wait. Are you
serious right now?

01:04:18.322 --> 01:04:19.788
Let go of me, Charlie.
Charlie.

01:04:19.790 --> 01:04:22.990
Hey, Sammy,
calm the fuck down.
I can do this.

01:04:24.728 --> 01:04:26.728
Fuck! Hey!

01:04:26.730 --> 01:04:28.330
Sam, no!

01:04:28.332 --> 01:04:29.731
Hey!
Greg, get off me.

01:04:29.733 --> 01:04:31.166
Sam, geez!

01:04:31.168 --> 01:04:32.601
Uhh!

01:04:34.638 --> 01:04:36.338
Oh, my God.
She hit me!

01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:37.739
Are you all right?
She fucking hit me!

01:04:37.741 --> 01:04:39.407
Are you OK?
Are you OK?

01:04:39.409 --> 01:04:40.742
Let's go.

01:04:40.744 --> 01:04:43.411
Guys,
what's going on?

01:07:15.931 --> 01:07:18.900
We're looking for
an Amira Jafari?

01:07:18.902 --> 01:07:22.303
We're told she might
be staying here
with you.

01:07:22.305 --> 01:07:24.545
She's being charged
with assault.

01:07:25.475 --> 01:07:27.008
Is she here?

01:07:27.010 --> 01:07:28.910
No. She's not.

01:07:35.518 --> 01:07:36.918
Amira Jafari?

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:38.653
Yeah?

01:07:38.655 --> 01:07:40.255
You're being charged
with assault.

01:07:40.257 --> 01:07:41.923
Aah!
Take it easy!

01:07:41.925 --> 01:07:44.659
Sir, I'd advise you
to not get involved.

01:07:51.467 --> 01:07:53.368
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:07:53.370 --> 01:07:56.538
Anything you say
can be used against you
in a court of law.

01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:58.006
You have the right
to a lawyer...

01:08:07.950 --> 01:08:09.784
I'm sorry to keep
bothering you.

01:08:09.786 --> 01:08:11.186
Are you sure you don't
need a translator
or anything?

01:08:11.188 --> 01:08:13.288
I speak fluent Arabic.

01:08:13.290 --> 01:08:16.024
Sir, I'm sorry.
You're gonna have to wait
for the arresting officer.

01:08:19.862 --> 01:08:21.129
What the hell
happened, Sam?

01:08:21.131 --> 01:08:22.529
Bassam, I fucked up.

01:08:24.366 --> 01:08:27.969
Hello, Miss. I need to
speak to Amira Jafari.

01:08:27.970 --> 01:08:29.470
No.

01:08:29.473 --> 01:08:31.038
That's OK.
I'm her uncle.

01:08:31.041 --> 01:08:33.975
Officer Velez
will be out to speak
with you shortly.

01:08:35.979 --> 01:08:37.979
What happened, Sam?

01:08:37.981 --> 01:08:39.981
We got into a fight.
You and her?

01:08:39.983 --> 01:08:41.983
No. I got into a fight,
and she jumped in.

01:08:41.984 --> 01:08:43.484
It all just happened so fast.

01:08:43.487 --> 01:08:44.986
Why was she with you?

01:08:44.988 --> 01:08:47.322
I took her to my cousin's
engagement party.

01:08:47.323 --> 01:08:49.591
Mr. Jafari?
Yes?

01:08:49.593 --> 01:08:51.725
She'll be eligible
for bail in the morning.

01:08:51.728 --> 01:08:54.595
When she's released,
she'll have 24 hours
to get her affairs together

01:08:54.598 --> 01:08:57.599
before she needs to report
to the Federal Detention
Center in Queens.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:59.267
And then what?

01:08:59.269 --> 01:09:01.236
She'll be processed
and put back on a plane
to Iraq.

01:09:01.238 --> 01:09:02.604
She can't go back to Iraq.

01:09:02.606 --> 01:09:04.005
She doesn't have a choice.

01:09:04.006 --> 01:09:06.006
This isn't about
the assault charge.

01:09:06.009 --> 01:09:08.609
She was issued a notice
to appear last December,

01:09:08.612 --> 01:09:13.113
and when she didn't show,
the court issued an order
of deportation.

01:09:13.116 --> 01:09:15.015
Can we fight it?
It's a final order.

01:09:15.018 --> 01:09:16.618
Sir, you don't understand.

01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:18.019
You can't send her
back to Iraq.

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:19.621
Her life will be in danger.

01:09:19.622 --> 01:09:21.856
It's out of my hands.
I'm sorry.

01:09:21.858 --> 01:09:23.191
What if she were
married to an American?

01:09:23.193 --> 01:09:25.693
It wouldn't
make a difference.

01:09:27.429 --> 01:09:29.096
Married, Sam?

01:09:29.099 --> 01:09:33.033
I'm just trying
to think through
all of our options.

01:09:33.036 --> 01:09:34.935
You took her to a party?

01:09:37.038 --> 01:09:38.439
I'm sorry, Bassam.

01:09:38.441 --> 01:09:40.108
It's too late.

01:09:42.044 --> 01:09:43.645
Excuse me.

01:09:43.647 --> 01:09:45.647
Bassam, I can...
Go!

01:09:45.649 --> 01:09:47.448
I'll handle it from here.

01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:48.816
I want to help.

01:09:48.818 --> 01:09:50.698
Stay away from her,
Sam.

01:09:52.054 --> 01:09:54.055
Miss, I really need to see her.

01:09:54.057 --> 01:09:57.125
Yes, sir.
Please.

01:09:58.627 --> 01:10:02.130
You don't understand.
I must see her.

01:10:19.081 --> 01:10:21.149
Sam.

01:10:26.088 --> 01:10:28.089
Um...

01:10:28.091 --> 01:10:31.526
Should we talk about
what the hell got
into you last night?

01:10:31.528 --> 01:10:33.127
What got into me?
Yeah.

01:10:33.129 --> 01:10:36.698
Hmm?
I was trying to protect
Jack's investment.

01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:39.100
Trying to protect
Jack's investment?

01:10:39.102 --> 01:10:44.105
Sam, Jack's investment
is gonna be fine.
I need you to trust me.

01:10:44.107 --> 01:10:48.710
I don't think that you realize

01:10:48.712 --> 01:10:51.045
how bad I need this account.

01:10:51.047 --> 01:10:53.348
Claire pressed charges
against Amira.

01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:55.717
I know.

01:10:55.719 --> 01:10:59.120
I tried to stop her,
and...

01:10:59.122 --> 01:11:01.222
She's pregnant.
She got hit.

01:11:01.224 --> 01:11:03.124
What do you
want me to say?

01:11:03.126 --> 01:11:04.726
Amira's being deported.

01:11:04.728 --> 01:11:07.729
Oh, fuck, man. I didn't
realize that. OK.

01:11:07.731 --> 01:11:10.131
I'm gonna call Claire.
I'll have her drop
the fucking charges.

01:11:10.133 --> 01:11:13.735
Don't bother.
It doesn't matter.

01:11:13.737 --> 01:11:15.136
It's done.
It's already done.

01:11:15.138 --> 01:11:18.539
You can't do
anything about it.

01:11:18.541 --> 01:11:20.141
Can I get you anything?

01:11:20.143 --> 01:11:22.744
I'm OK, thank you.

01:11:22.746 --> 01:11:24.145
Sammy, I'm sorry...

01:11:24.147 --> 01:11:26.147
Charlie, I need you
to be straight with me

01:11:26.149 --> 01:11:29.150
and tell me everything
that's going on
with the fund.

01:11:29.152 --> 01:11:31.152
Dude, I won't...
Just no more bullshit.

01:11:31.154 --> 01:11:32.754
I'm not bullshitting you, man.

01:11:32.756 --> 01:11:34.188
Listen...

01:11:34.190 --> 01:11:35.857
This is not the Army, OK?

01:11:35.859 --> 01:11:37.525
This is the real world.

01:11:37.527 --> 01:11:39.761
And all of us,
every single one of us,

01:11:39.763 --> 01:11:41.496
is a prisoner of the system.

01:11:41.498 --> 01:11:44.165
And that system
is called free market
capitalism, right?

01:11:44.167 --> 01:11:46.167
And it's not fair.
It's not fuckin' fair,

01:11:46.169 --> 01:11:48.836
because it was never
designed to be fair.

01:11:48.838 --> 01:11:52.173
See, I know that
you're all worried about
the SCC and all that shit,

01:11:52.175 --> 01:11:53.875
but fuck them.

01:11:53.877 --> 01:11:56.778
See, they're trying
to tell me how to
do my job,

01:11:56.780 --> 01:11:58.780
but they don't know shit
about analyzing risk.

01:11:58.782 --> 01:12:02.784
See, they are always
looking at the worst-case
scenarios,

01:12:02.786 --> 01:12:04.786
which never pertain
to me, right?

01:12:04.788 --> 01:12:07.188
But even if they did,
I have hedges in place

01:12:07.190 --> 01:12:10.024
that allow me to back out
of my riskiest positions.
Do you understand what...

01:12:10.026 --> 01:12:11.793
What kind of hedges
are you talking
about, Charlie?

01:12:11.795 --> 01:12:14.796
I have these offshore
investment entities,
right?

01:12:14.798 --> 01:12:17.131
And they can buy huge
stakes in American companies,

01:12:17.133 --> 01:12:18.800
and that influences
the stock price.

01:12:18.802 --> 01:12:22.203
So it gives us
an edge in trading.

01:12:22.205 --> 01:12:23.805
You've rigged the system.

01:12:23.807 --> 01:12:25.807
Yes. Absolutely.

01:12:25.809 --> 01:12:27.809
That's why you don't
need to worry about it.

01:12:27.811 --> 01:12:29.210
It's all fuckin' rigged, Sam,

01:12:29.212 --> 01:12:31.746
and there's no need
in trying to fight it.

01:12:31.748 --> 01:12:35.149
This is how I think of it.

01:12:35.151 --> 01:12:38.219
You were lucky enough
to be a part of that 1%

01:12:38.221 --> 01:12:39.954
that served the nation,
right?

01:12:39.956 --> 01:12:42.223
So, I'm giving you
an opportunity to be
a part of the 1%

01:12:42.225 --> 01:12:43.958
that runs the nation.

01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:47.228
Because if anybody
deserves to reap
the benefits

01:12:47.230 --> 01:12:50.832
of this weird,
fucked-up system that we're
living in, it's you,

01:12:50.834 --> 01:12:54.302
and I want that for you.
I do.

01:12:56.839 --> 01:12:59.841
And I need you there
on Tuesday.

01:12:59.843 --> 01:13:01.309
You got it, man?

01:13:02.845 --> 01:13:04.245
I got it.

01:13:06.249 --> 01:13:08.816
Hey, this is gonna be
good, man, all right?

01:13:08.818 --> 01:13:10.818
I'll see you on Tuesday,
yeah?

01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:14.255
I'm glad we talked, man.
Feel a lot better.

01:13:14.257 --> 01:13:15.923
All right.

01:13:26.269 --> 01:13:28.970
I did my due diligence.

01:13:28.972 --> 01:13:30.972
I know all about Charlie.

01:13:30.974 --> 01:13:33.875
There's no way
that he could be getting
those kinds of returns

01:13:33.877 --> 01:13:35.977
playing by the rules,
but it doesn't matter

01:13:35.979 --> 01:13:39.347
'cause nobody plays
by the rules anymore.

01:13:40.883 --> 01:13:42.350
I know where
you're coming from.

01:13:44.887 --> 01:13:48.890
I tried to hold onto
my idealism for
as long as I could

01:13:48.892 --> 01:13:52.160
after I left Vietnam,
but it didn't last.

01:13:52.162 --> 01:13:55.897
Things changed,
and they continue
to change.

01:13:55.899 --> 01:13:57.665
It's not just
the financial world.

01:13:57.667 --> 01:14:00.301
It's everywhere.

01:14:00.303 --> 01:14:03.905
I was on the board
to rebuild the Twin Towers.

01:14:03.907 --> 01:14:05.673
I...

01:14:05.675 --> 01:14:09.310
If those buildings
had been destroyed
in any other country,

01:14:09.312 --> 01:14:11.979
they would have been
rebuilt within a year.

01:14:11.981 --> 01:14:13.581
Done. No questions asked.

01:14:13.583 --> 01:14:18.186
But America has become this
cesspool of self-interest.

01:14:18.188 --> 01:14:21.189
If you can't get anybody
to agree on anything,

01:14:21.191 --> 01:14:22.990
then nothing will get done.

01:14:22.992 --> 01:14:25.927
So, the only way
to survive

01:14:25.929 --> 01:14:28.396
is to fend for yourself.

01:14:30.699 --> 01:14:34.335
There's dozens of guys
like Charlie out there.

01:14:34.337 --> 01:14:37.004
Only reason that I'm
willing to go with him

01:14:37.006 --> 01:14:40.007
is because I want to
help you.

01:14:42.945 --> 01:14:44.278
Are you in?

01:14:47.349 --> 01:14:48.916
I'm in.

01:14:48.918 --> 01:14:50.418
Good.

01:14:56.959 --> 01:14:58.960
Record your message
after the tone.

01:15:00.597 --> 01:15:03.297
You know, all of those
movies are bullshit.

01:15:03.299 --> 01:15:06.801
They're always like, "You only
get one phone call in jail,"

01:15:06.803 --> 01:15:09.971
but this is, like,
my third call.

01:15:11.373 --> 01:15:14.375
My brother Amend and I
used to run around Baghdad

01:15:14.377 --> 01:15:16.377
like crazy people.

01:15:16.379 --> 01:15:18.980
It was the best time ever.

01:15:18.982 --> 01:15:25.887
And so I was wondering if you
wanted to spend one last
day with me tomorrow.

01:15:25.889 --> 01:15:30.391
I've seen all of those
romantic movies...

01:15:30.393 --> 01:15:36.998
but none of them compare
to the way I feel about you...

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.866
Not even "Sweet Home Alabama."

01:15:40.402 --> 01:15:45.006
And hopefully,
that makes sense.

01:15:45.008 --> 01:15:50.478
And hopefully,
we can spend one last
day together tomorrow.

01:16:22.210 --> 01:16:24.512
You don't have to
come back with me.

01:16:27.049 --> 01:16:28.516
It's too late.

01:16:33.456 --> 01:16:35.056
Hello?

01:16:35.058 --> 01:16:36.457
It's Sam.

01:16:36.459 --> 01:16:38.459
Come on up.

01:16:38.461 --> 01:16:40.061
Who is it?

01:16:40.063 --> 01:16:41.462
Sam.

01:16:41.464 --> 01:16:43.464
Why is he here?
He's here for me.

01:16:43.466 --> 01:16:45.066
What do you mean?
I called him.

01:16:45.068 --> 01:16:46.467
Why?
We're going out.

01:16:46.469 --> 01:16:47.868
No, you're not.

01:16:49.305 --> 01:16:50.705
Go to your room.

01:17:01.083 --> 01:17:04.218
I told you to
stay away from her.

01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:06.220
Bassam, if it's OK with you,

01:17:06.222 --> 01:17:09.590
I was hoping I could
spend one last day
with her.

01:17:11.493 --> 01:17:13.861
All this mess is your fault.

01:17:13.863 --> 01:17:15.496
I know.

01:17:15.498 --> 01:17:18.499
Now I have to go
back to Iraq...

01:17:18.501 --> 01:17:20.101
to watch over her,

01:17:20.103 --> 01:17:23.543
leave everything
that I've built
behind.

01:17:24.106 --> 01:17:25.573
Jesus, Bassam.

01:17:27.109 --> 01:17:28.709
I'm so sorry.

01:17:28.711 --> 01:17:33.280
All I wanted and
asked was for you
to watch over her.

01:17:33.282 --> 01:17:34.849
I know.

01:17:36.518 --> 01:17:39.053
You let me down.

01:17:39.055 --> 01:17:41.522
Just leave, Sam.

01:17:41.524 --> 01:17:44.925
I will take her to
the Detention Facility
in the morning.

01:17:46.528 --> 01:17:47.962
No!

01:17:47.964 --> 01:17:50.131
I'm spending my last
day with him.

01:17:50.133 --> 01:17:51.399
You don't know
what you're saying.

01:17:51.401 --> 01:17:53.200
It's my decision.

01:19:22.691 --> 01:19:24.771
Will you do
something for me?

01:19:28.363 --> 01:19:30.631
Anything you want.

01:19:30.633 --> 01:19:32.700
Anything?
Anything.

01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:43.244
Ahem.

01:19:43.246 --> 01:19:46.714
Uh... right.

01:19:48.250 --> 01:19:49.717
Um...

01:19:53.255 --> 01:19:55.656
I just got back to America.

01:19:55.658 --> 01:19:58.659
I've been away
for the greater part
of the last decade.

01:19:58.661 --> 01:20:00.261
I've been serving
in the Army.

01:20:00.263 --> 01:20:02.663
And, um...

01:20:02.665 --> 01:20:09.036
And I came back, luckily,
unharmed physically,
mentally, emotionally,

01:20:09.038 --> 01:20:11.038
but still it's been
a little bit of a struggle

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:12.673
assimilating back into society,

01:20:12.675 --> 01:20:14.275
it really has,

01:20:14.277 --> 01:20:17.278
and I think I'm starting
to figure out why.

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:21.282
I went off to war,
but this country lost
its fucking mind.

01:20:21.284 --> 01:20:23.184
I'll give you an example.

01:20:23.186 --> 01:20:25.286
Vampires...

01:20:25.288 --> 01:20:26.687
are everywhere.

01:20:28.291 --> 01:20:29.757
They're in movies,
television.

01:20:29.759 --> 01:20:33.294
I mean, I was approached
by some bloodthirsty chick

01:20:33.296 --> 01:20:35.696
who had been traveling
around the Earth,

01:20:35.698 --> 01:20:37.698
you know, fucking
bucketloads of dudes

01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:39.700
for the last couple
hundred years,

01:20:39.702 --> 01:20:43.037
who cornered me and said,
"You're my one true love,"

01:20:43.039 --> 01:20:44.939
I'd be like, "Get
the fuck out of here."

01:20:49.945 --> 01:20:53.714
Um... another thing
that's changed is

01:20:53.716 --> 01:20:57.718
how extreme commercials are,
advertisements in general.

01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:04.325
I watched a Doritos commercial
that promised me
third-degree burns.

01:21:04.327 --> 01:21:06.727
That's not a commitment
I'm willing to make for a snack.

01:21:10.732 --> 01:21:12.733
America's gone crazy.

01:21:12.735 --> 01:21:14.668
A lot of things have changed.

01:21:16.338 --> 01:21:19.406
Another thing
that's changed... I...

01:21:21.343 --> 01:21:24.745
I, um...

01:21:24.747 --> 01:21:26.747
This might not be the place
to talk about it,

01:21:26.749 --> 01:21:29.750
but I've found a...

01:21:29.752 --> 01:21:32.753
I've found a beautiful woman
that I'm not going to be able

01:21:32.755 --> 01:21:35.756
to spend any more
time with very soon.

01:21:35.758 --> 01:21:37.825
I don't know when
I'll get to see her again.

01:21:39.761 --> 01:21:43.764
She's the beautiful woman
sitting right there.

01:21:43.766 --> 01:21:46.367
You don't have to look at her,
but you can if you want to.

01:21:51.339 --> 01:21:53.140
She's leaving the country
tomorrow morning,

01:21:53.142 --> 01:21:55.843
and I don't think she'll
ever be able to return.

01:22:01.616 --> 01:22:03.851
And I don't know
what to do about it.

01:22:30.412 --> 01:22:32.880
I don't know.
I don't care.

01:22:45.427 --> 01:22:47.828
"Dear Bassam,

01:22:47.830 --> 01:22:50.831
"Amira and I are leaving.

01:22:50.833 --> 01:22:53.834
"We're not sure exactly
where we're headed.

01:22:53.836 --> 01:22:56.837
"but don't worry about us.

01:22:56.839 --> 01:22:59.373
"We'll be OK
wherever we land.

01:22:59.375 --> 01:23:02.910
I guess you could say
we're a couple of penguins
lost in the desert."

01:23:05.847 --> 01:23:10.451
"To be honest,
the only thing that
we know for certain

01:23:10.453 --> 01:23:11.933
is we're better off
together."

01:23:14.856 --> 01:23:18.926
"And, Bassam,
we're gonna miss you.

01:23:18.928 --> 01:23:21.895
"We'll be in touch once we
settle down somewhere.

01:23:21.897 --> 01:23:25.933
Love always,
Amira and Sam."
