WEBVTT

00:12.417 --> 00:15.083
These are from
Rwanda, Uncle Tad?

00:15.166 --> 00:17.250
800,000 dead
in a hundred days.

00:17.333 --> 00:19.625
Rwanda's where
the gorillas are, aren't
they?

00:19.709 --> 00:22.125
I love gorillas.
Did you see any?

00:22.208 --> 00:24.333
Uh, it wasn't that kind of trip.

00:24.417 --> 00:25.917
Did you see anybody
get killed, Uncle
Tad?

00:26.000 --> 00:27.667
No, just a lot
of dead bodies.

00:27.750 --> 00:31.125
Oh, you should have stuck
to the gorillas if you ask
me.

00:31.208 --> 00:33.625
- I need a drink.
- I'll get you one, dad.

00:33.709 --> 00:35.500
Hey, we're on our
own tonight, Gin.

00:35.583 --> 00:36.500
Ice bucket's empty.

00:36.583 --> 00:37.667
I gave the help the night off

00:37.750 --> 00:38.792
'cause of the snowstorm.

00:38.875 --> 00:40.792
Well, that is
magnanimous of you, dad.

00:40.875 --> 00:43.083
Oh, it'll be nice.
Just family for once.

00:46.041 --> 00:47.250
Who could that be?

00:56.041 --> 00:57.000
Lauren?

00:57.083 --> 00:59.166
What are you doing here?

00:59.250 --> 01:02.750
It is my favorite
grandson's
birthday.

01:02.834 --> 01:06.041
'Is it not?'

01:06.125 --> 01:08.250
Oh, thank you, sweetheart.

01:08.333 --> 01:10.542
Mom, I didn't think
you'd make it.

01:10.625 --> 01:13.333
- Look at your hair.
- I had it colored.

01:13.417 --> 01:15.208
I can see that.

01:15.291 --> 01:19.125
There is the man
of the hour now.

01:19.208 --> 01:20.959
Hi, grandma.

01:23.667 --> 01:26.709
You look just like your father.

01:28.625 --> 01:31.333
How is
the unmentionable one, anyway?

01:31.417 --> 01:32.458
I wouldn't know, mom.

01:32.542 --> 01:34.500
He's in Ohio with his new wife.

01:34.583 --> 01:35.667
Well, he was good-looking.

01:35.750 --> 01:37.750
I'll give him that.

01:37.834 --> 01:39.667
And I see you're
back from safari.

01:39.750 --> 01:40.834
Sherpas carry you
or did you make it

01:40.917 --> 01:42.125
through the snow on your own?

01:44.333 --> 01:45.500
'Your morbid fascination'

01:45.583 --> 01:48.250
with death is
getting worrisome, Tad.

01:48.333 --> 01:49.750
Thank you, mother.
I'm glad you like
them.

01:49.834 --> 01:52.667
They're horrid.

01:52.750 --> 01:55.166
As opposed to
this lovely creature.

01:55.250 --> 01:57.583
I'm Diane
Gilbert,
Mrs. Williams.

01:57.667 --> 02:00.125
Oh, please. Lauren.

02:00.208 --> 02:01.667
Do tell, Tad.

02:01.750 --> 02:04.709
She's with me, not Tad.

02:06.291 --> 02:08.041
Of course she is.

02:10.041 --> 02:11.834
- Yikes.
- Power's out.

02:11.917 --> 02:13.417
(Diane)
I love blackouts.

02:13.500 --> 02:14.750
(Tad)
Does this mean
we can all leave?

02:14.834 --> 02:16.625
(Stan)
No.

02:16.709 --> 02:17.875
'It means
we're gonna get cozy'

02:17.959 --> 02:20.834
'have a nice
family gathering..'

02:20.917 --> 02:22.250
...plus one.

02:23.625 --> 02:26.000
Mom? You okay?

02:27.500 --> 02:30.750
Will someone
please do something?

03:48.000 --> 03:49.792
That's the Internet mogul?

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Mr. Heller?

03:53.083 --> 03:55.083
Hey, detectives!

03:55.166 --> 03:56.542
Thanks for coming.

03:56.625 --> 03:59.125
Hungry?
Want a garden burger?

03:59.208 --> 04:00.667
No. Thanks.

04:00.750 --> 04:02.792
You have information
on Lauren Williams?

04:02.875 --> 04:06.625
Yeah. Lady supposedly,
drowned accidentally?

04:06.709 --> 04:08.041
That's right.

04:08.125 --> 04:10.083
Look under the board.

04:11.417 --> 04:13.333
I'm the first owner
since the place was
put

04:13.417 --> 04:15.208
on the market back in '96.

04:15.291 --> 04:17.250
- So nobody's touched
anything.
- No.

04:20.208 --> 04:22.208
Do you see it?

04:27.083 --> 04:29.375
(Valens)
'The scratch marks.'

04:31.583 --> 04:33.250
You okay there, Scotty?

04:39.417 --> 04:41.333
It looks like a fingernail.

04:42.375 --> 04:44.125
'Red nail polish.'

04:49.917 --> 04:51.458
Take a look.

04:51.542 --> 04:53.834
(Heller)
'It belongs to
Lauren Williams, doesn't it?'

04:55.583 --> 04:56.750
Could be.

04:56.834 --> 04:58.500
Means she was
murdered, doesn't
it?

04:58.583 --> 05:01.083
It means she put up a fight.

05:02.375 --> 05:05.792
Question is,
who was she fighting?

05:44.417 --> 05:47.041
Hurry up.
Bus ain't gonna wait.

05:51.667 --> 05:53.875
Morning, kiddo.

05:53.959 --> 05:55.458
'Sup.

05:58.208 --> 05:59.333
Hey, you.

06:00.667 --> 06:02.917
Found this in
my sheets this morning..

06:03.000 --> 06:04.458
...somebody's sock.

06:04.542 --> 06:07.125
- Mysterious.
- 'Yeah.'

06:07.208 --> 06:09.291
No ideas how it
might've got
there?

06:09.375 --> 06:10.959
Possibly this new neighbor

06:11.041 --> 06:12.417
moved in below.

06:12.500 --> 06:15.583
- Frisky fella?
- Frisky ain't the half of
it.

06:15.667 --> 06:16.959
Well, maybe had the
lady
let the poor guy

06:17.041 --> 06:18.291
stay the night,
he'd be less
careless.

06:18.375 --> 06:19.917
Oh, lady's got a son.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.417
Son don't need to know
what his mama's up to.

06:22.500 --> 06:23.834
I hear that.

06:25.458 --> 06:26.625
So, uh..

06:26.709 --> 06:29.625
...you have a nice
day now, detective.

06:29.709 --> 06:32.125
You too, ma'am.

06:32.208 --> 06:33.750
Get on now.

06:35.208 --> 06:39.166
- See you tonight?
- If you're lucky.

06:44.917 --> 06:46.333
(Rush)
So if that
fingernail is Lauren's

06:46.417 --> 06:48.166
my guess is someone
was on the diving board

06:48.250 --> 06:49.166
holding her head under.

06:49.250 --> 06:50.458
While she scratched and clawed

06:50.542 --> 06:52.667
at the only thing
she could reach.

06:52.750 --> 06:55.792
The night of January 11, 1996
half the city lost power

06:55.875 --> 06:59.667
from 8:15 P.M. to 1:37 A.M.

06:59.750 --> 07:02.500
ME puts the time of death
at approximately 1:00 A.M.

07:02.583 --> 07:04.500
Which means she was
probably killed in the
dark.

07:04.583 --> 07:06.166
Her ex-husband
claimed he found her

07:06.250 --> 07:09.333
the next morning around
6:00 floating in the pool.

07:09.417 --> 07:12.625
Blood alcohol was 0.24.

07:12.709 --> 07:15.166
That sauced, no wonder
they thought it was an
accident.

07:15.250 --> 07:16.709
There were only five people
in the house that night

07:16.792 --> 07:18.041
other than Lauren.

07:18.125 --> 07:19.458
(Rush)
'Stanford, the ex-husband'

07:19.542 --> 07:21.792
Virginia, the daughter,
Tad, the son.

07:21.875 --> 07:22.917
(Miller)
'Diane Gilbert'

07:23.000 --> 07:24.375
Stanford's fiancee at the time.

07:24.458 --> 07:27.667
And Matthew,
Lauren's 13-year-old grandson.

07:27.750 --> 07:29.041
Five rich little Indians.

07:29.125 --> 07:30.333
Oh, follow the money

07:30.417 --> 07:33.500
see who benefited
from Lauren's death.

07:33.583 --> 07:35.291
My money's on the ex.

07:35.375 --> 07:36.917
Well, Scotty and Will
are with him now.

07:37.000 --> 07:37.959
Well, that's good.

07:38.041 --> 07:39.542
'Cause I'm guessing
he's involved.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.375
Why is that?

07:41.458 --> 07:43.542
Stanford Williams
was 60 at the time

07:43.625 --> 07:46.125
and his fiancee was 28.

07:46.208 --> 07:49.917
- That make him a killer?
- That makes him a scumbag.

08:01.125 --> 08:03.000
You're sure Lauren was murdered?

08:03.083 --> 08:06.041
(Jeffries)
You find that hard to
believe?

08:06.125 --> 08:08.250
- Yes and no.
- Because?

08:08.333 --> 08:10.709
Because of who was at
the house that night, of
course.

08:10.792 --> 08:12.875
And no?

08:12.959 --> 08:15.667
Because my ex-wife
was a raving bitch.

08:15.750 --> 08:17.834
- Bad divorce?
- Hideous.

08:17.917 --> 08:19.250
(Valens)
'Well, that much hostility'

08:19.333 --> 08:21.583
why'd she show up
at your house that night?

08:21.667 --> 08:23.917
My daughter Ginny
invited her out of courtesy

08:24.000 --> 08:25.166
thinking she wouldn't come.

08:25.250 --> 08:28.250
Must've been awkward
with your fiancee there.

08:28.333 --> 08:30.583
Awkward would be
putting it mildly.

08:30.667 --> 08:34.000
So maybe you took
advantage of the blackout..

08:34.083 --> 08:36.625
...got rid of your ex
once and for all.

08:36.709 --> 08:37.875
After she cleaned me out

08:37.959 --> 08:41.375
I thought of little else
but killing Lauren.

08:41.458 --> 08:43.250
But drowning was
never an option..

08:43.333 --> 08:44.583
...too humane.

08:44.667 --> 08:45.709
Really?

08:45.792 --> 08:48.083
My fantasy was
to bury her alive

08:48.166 --> 08:50.917
scarabs feasting
on her intestines.

08:52.208 --> 08:54.417
Where were you between
midnight and the time

08:54.500 --> 08:57.750
you found your wife
in the pool, Mr. Williams?

08:57.834 --> 08:59.333
'I was in bed.'

08:59.417 --> 09:01.250
- With your fiancee?
- No.

09:01.333 --> 09:03.250
Alone, I'm afraid.

09:03.333 --> 09:06.250
- Lauren made sure of that.
- 'How?'

09:07.667 --> 09:09.166
She dropped a bomb on us

09:09.250 --> 09:11.291
as she was her want to do.

09:20.542 --> 09:22.333
Here are more candles.

09:22.417 --> 09:24.333
Stan, there are fresh
batteries in the
drawer

09:24.417 --> 09:26.208
for the flashlight.

09:26.291 --> 09:27.125
Hm.

09:27.208 --> 09:28.291
Well, you certainly seem to know

09:28.375 --> 09:30.625
your way around, don't you?

09:30.709 --> 09:31.792
Lauren, don't start.

09:31.875 --> 09:33.291
I'm just saying your new one

09:33.375 --> 09:34.667
seems very handy.

09:34.750 --> 09:38.041
- Incoming.
- Mom, it's Matt's birthday.

09:38.125 --> 09:41.208
I know how difficult
this must be for you, Diane

09:41.291 --> 09:43.375
being in a house
with no electricity.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.166
(Diane)
'I'm not sure I follow.'

09:45.250 --> 09:47.834
(Lauren)
'A reminder of
your childhood, dear.'

09:47.917 --> 09:51.417
You are from Tinley,
Arkansas, aren't you?

09:51.500 --> 09:55.125
- You researched my fiancee?
- Medic.

09:55.208 --> 09:58.083
Maybe back in your day
there was no
electricity

09:58.166 --> 09:59.667
Mrs. Williams, but in mine--

09:59.750 --> 10:01.667
Your three children
are living with your mother

10:01.750 --> 10:03.500
'back in Tinley,
aren't they?'

10:03.583 --> 10:06.709
Lauren, that's enough.

10:06.792 --> 10:08.333
Stanford, don't tell me
you didn't know

10:08.417 --> 10:11.083
about Diane's brood?

10:11.166 --> 10:13.667
Now don't let
the fact that Stanford

10:13.750 --> 10:16.125
was an abject
failure as a father

10:16.208 --> 10:19.166
with our children
worry you, Diane.

10:19.250 --> 10:21.667
I'm sure
he'll be a wonderful pop

10:21.750 --> 10:23.625
to your young'uns.

10:24.792 --> 10:28.333
Stan told me
you were a bitch,
but..

10:28.417 --> 10:30.583
But what, dear?

10:30.667 --> 10:33.500
'He didn't tell me
you were so cruel.'

10:36.125 --> 10:38.375
Three kids?

10:40.542 --> 10:42.709
You're gonna pay for this.

10:52.291 --> 10:54.417
Lauren took no prisoners.

10:54.500 --> 10:56.875
So, bombshell have
the desired effect?

10:56.959 --> 10:59.792
Lauren did me a favor,
saved me from getting
saddled

10:59.875 --> 11:01.375
with three more mouths to feed.

11:01.458 --> 11:03.917
So you see, I had no reason
to kill her that night.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.291
Well, how'd Diane take you
breaking it off with her?

11:09.000 --> 11:10.959
Badly.

11:24.875 --> 11:27.458
You're saying somebody
actually murdered Mrs.
Williams?

11:27.542 --> 11:30.083
Somebody who was in the house
the night of the blackout.

11:30.166 --> 11:33.834
Somebody who had
reason to want her
dead.

11:33.917 --> 11:36.875
Well, I was there and I had
reason, but I didn't kill
her.

11:36.959 --> 11:38.625
No?

11:38.709 --> 11:41.125
She was more pathetic
than anything else.

11:41.208 --> 11:42.750
(Vera)
'That right?'

11:43.625 --> 11:45.375
After 20 years of marriage

11:45.458 --> 11:48.458
Stan traded Lauren
in for a newer model.

11:48.542 --> 11:49.917
You?

11:50.041 --> 11:51.875
Now that I have
a few more miles on me

11:51.959 --> 11:54.041
I can understand how she felt.

11:54.125 --> 11:56.583
But you didn't
understand that back in
'96.

11:56.667 --> 12:00.625
When you were the one
with the low mileage.

12:00.709 --> 12:02.083
No.

12:02.166 --> 12:04.583
Well, Lauren cost you
your chance of
marrying

12:04.667 --> 12:06.417
into the Williams clan.

12:07.875 --> 12:11.000
In retrospect,
that blackout was a blessing.

12:11.083 --> 12:12.291
A blessing?

12:12.375 --> 12:15.041
Being trapped in that house..

12:15.125 --> 12:17.041
...in the dark,
with those people.

12:17.125 --> 12:19.458
- Eye-opening?
- Terrifying.

12:30.041 --> 12:32.291
Thought you would've booked.

12:32.375 --> 12:34.625
Gone from bad
to worse out there.

12:34.709 --> 12:37.875
- Whiteout.
- Oh, the good old days.

12:37.959 --> 12:39.875
'Your family
looked so perfect.'

12:39.959 --> 12:42.417
Yeah, "looked" being
the operative word.

12:45.208 --> 12:48.583
- That's your mother?
- Took it when I was 13.

12:49.917 --> 12:51.875
She was incredible.

12:51.959 --> 12:55.291
She was a beauty queen
from Garth, Pennsylvania.

12:56.291 --> 12:59.625
Garth? That's as bad as Tinley.

12:59.709 --> 13:01.959
Williams Steel
had a plant there.

13:02.041 --> 13:04.667
That's how she met my dad,
on an inspection tour.

13:04.750 --> 13:06.000
So what went wrong?

13:06.083 --> 13:07.500
My dad lost interest
after we were born.

13:07.583 --> 13:08.834
Started fooling around.

13:08.917 --> 13:11.125
Although he could've
been cheating before

13:11.208 --> 13:12.166
for all I know.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.458
No. It was later.

13:14.542 --> 13:16.792
Around the time
you were born, Tad.

13:16.875 --> 13:18.792
I knew it had to
be my fault somehow.

13:22.083 --> 13:25.083
Can you imagine cheating on
a woman that looked like that?

13:25.166 --> 13:26.625
I can.

13:27.959 --> 13:31.583
You're wasting
your talent and your life.

13:31.667 --> 13:32.875
What's it to you?

13:32.959 --> 13:35.834
- I'm your mother.
- When convenient.

13:37.417 --> 13:38.375
We'll talk about this later.

13:38.458 --> 13:40.500
No, by all means, continue.

13:40.583 --> 13:43.125
I am not gonna be
who you want me to be, mom.

13:43.208 --> 13:46.458
Oh, you mean a success,
as opposed to an abject
failure.

13:47.792 --> 13:48.959
I'm not sure Reuters

13:49.041 --> 13:50.709
or the Associated Press
would agree with you.

13:50.792 --> 13:53.959
Peddling pictures
of the world's
misery?

13:54.041 --> 13:55.750
Please. It's shameful.

13:55.834 --> 13:58.291
Okay, just stay
the hell out of my life.

13:58.375 --> 14:00.250
I will do no such thing.

14:11.166 --> 14:14.917
If only that were really you.

14:17.417 --> 14:18.333
Don't mind me.

14:18.417 --> 14:20.375
When are you going to grow up

14:20.458 --> 14:21.750
and become a man?

14:21.834 --> 14:24.333
The day you die.

14:29.667 --> 14:30.792
So you just left them there

14:30.875 --> 14:32.667
at each other's throats?

14:32.750 --> 14:34.417
Went upstairs
and waited for Stan

14:34.500 --> 14:35.917
to break up with me.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.542
Which he did.

14:37.625 --> 14:39.959
Moms always know
just where to
strike.

14:40.041 --> 14:42.458
Woman went for the jugular.

14:42.542 --> 14:45.792
She pushed Tad over the edge.

14:45.875 --> 14:47.667
And he pushed back.

14:58.875 --> 15:00.208
Investigating
the murder of my mother

15:00.291 --> 15:03.208
is a serious waste
of taxpayer dollars.

15:03.875 --> 15:05.125
Oh, yeah?

15:05.208 --> 15:08.250
''Cause whoever did it
deserves a medal.'

15:08.333 --> 15:09.834
Maybe that's you.

15:09.917 --> 15:12.041
Now we know you
argued with
her..

15:12.125 --> 15:13.375
...the night she was killed.

15:13.458 --> 15:17.083
Yeah, well, I argued
with her every time I saw her.

15:17.166 --> 15:18.709
Always get that heated?

15:18.792 --> 15:21.375
Well, she wanted me
to be someone I wasn't.

15:21.458 --> 15:23.583
And I wanted her
to be someone she wasn't.

15:23.667 --> 15:25.417
So maybe you got sick
of her disapproval.

15:25.500 --> 15:26.917
Yeah, her tryin' to change you.

15:27.000 --> 15:28.375
She had no power over me.

15:28.458 --> 15:30.000
'Mothers always have power'

15:30.083 --> 15:31.458
whether you like it or not.

15:31.542 --> 15:33.166
Listen, Tad,
we did some checkin'.

15:33.250 --> 15:36.291
(Miller)
'You inherited
$3,000,000 when your mom died.'

15:36.375 --> 15:39.458
- Much to my dad's dismay.
- Why is that?

15:39.542 --> 15:40.875
All the money he got
from the settlement

15:40.959 --> 15:41.959
he squandered.

15:42.041 --> 15:44.458
And now you're rich
and he isn't?

15:44.542 --> 15:47.000
I gave every cent
of that money away.

15:47.083 --> 15:49.834
You gave away $3,000,000?

15:49.917 --> 15:52.083
I got the numbers
if you want to donate.

15:52.166 --> 15:54.417
Well, damn,
you could've kept
some.

15:54.500 --> 15:56.917
Some money costs
more than it's worth.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.500
Your sister,
Virginia,
feel that way?

15:59.583 --> 16:01.875
'Cause she's the only other
person to inherit from your
mom.

16:01.959 --> 16:04.166
My sister's circumstances
were different.

16:04.250 --> 16:05.875
She has a son.

16:05.959 --> 16:08.709
So she needed your mom's money?

16:08.792 --> 16:10.041
That's what mom thought.

16:20.959 --> 16:23.208
Poor Matty.

16:23.291 --> 16:24.875
His birthday feast.

16:24.959 --> 16:27.375
- Sandwiches.
- I made a roast, mom.

16:27.458 --> 16:29.291
But the power's out,
if you haven't noticed

16:29.375 --> 16:30.917
and the oven is electric.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.875
I know.

16:32.959 --> 16:34.333
It's not your fault.

16:34.417 --> 16:36.041
Then why are you trying
to make me feel like it is?

16:36.125 --> 16:38.291
Don't be so defensive, Ginny.

16:38.375 --> 16:41.041
I know you give your
all
when it comes to
Matt.

16:41.125 --> 16:43.125
Time to duck and cover, Gin.

16:44.834 --> 16:46.917
But that public school
you're sending him to

16:47.000 --> 16:49.083
is just so...public.

16:49.166 --> 16:52.583
Matt's education is
none of your business.

16:52.667 --> 16:55.750
It is my business
as long as you cash my
checks.

16:56.875 --> 16:58.583
You're not really
gonna go there, are you?

16:58.667 --> 17:01.458
When the unmentionable one
left you high and dry

17:01.542 --> 17:03.250
who bailed you out?

17:03.333 --> 17:04.667
I told you not
to take her money.

17:04.750 --> 17:07.917
Shut up, Tad.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.917
Not everyone enjoys
squalor the way you do.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.125
'So what are you saying, mom?'

17:12.208 --> 17:13.959
If I don't take Matt
out of public school

17:14.041 --> 17:15.834
you're going to cut me off?

17:15.917 --> 17:18.166
Don't be so melodramatic.

17:18.250 --> 17:20.458
You know what?

17:21.625 --> 17:24.000
Screw this.
Screw you.

17:24.083 --> 17:25.458
Where do you think
you're going?

17:25.542 --> 17:27.250
I'm gonna get my son and
get the hell away from you.

17:27.333 --> 17:29.792
Do not walk away
from me, Virginia.

17:29.875 --> 17:31.500
She's right, Gin. Run.

17:34.542 --> 17:36.750
Your money is not worth
the price tag it comes with.

17:36.834 --> 17:37.792
(Tad)
'Amen.'

17:37.875 --> 17:39.000
You say that now

17:39.083 --> 17:40.041
but come the end of the month

17:40.125 --> 17:42.291
what are you going to do?

17:45.208 --> 17:46.959
You walk out that door..

17:47.041 --> 17:50.709
...you'll never get
another penny from me.

17:50.792 --> 17:53.625
'Ever.'

18:05.458 --> 18:08.667
I was never prouder of
my sister than at that moment.

18:08.750 --> 18:10.834
But she didn't leave
the house that night.

18:10.917 --> 18:12.542
'Cause according
to the police report

18:12.625 --> 18:14.083
she was there in the morning.

18:14.166 --> 18:17.250
Yeah, whiteout trapped
us all there. So what?

18:17.333 --> 18:19.375
She and your mom
have words later?

18:21.250 --> 18:22.667
Where's this going?

18:22.750 --> 18:25.375
Like you said,
your sister needed the money.

18:25.458 --> 18:26.750
And your mom conveniently died

18:26.834 --> 18:29.166
before she could
change her will.

18:29.250 --> 18:31.083
My sister wouldn't hurt a fly.

18:48.875 --> 18:51.041
Detectives,
this is my son,
Matt

18:51.125 --> 18:54.000
on winter break
from med school.

18:54.083 --> 18:56.041
We're here to talk
about your grandmother.

18:56.125 --> 18:58.333
Heard from my uncle
you think she was
murdered.

18:58.417 --> 18:59.959
I find that
impossible to believe.

19:00.041 --> 19:02.041
I don't. She was a shrew.

19:02.125 --> 19:03.542
- So we heard.
- You heard wrong.

19:03.625 --> 19:05.792
- She was just complicated.
- How's that?

19:05.875 --> 19:09.166
Not the double-edged sword,
beauty was her curse bit, mom.

19:09.250 --> 19:10.500
It's true.

19:10.583 --> 19:13.542
When her looks faded,
she had nothing to fall back
on.

19:13.625 --> 19:15.709
'My mother likes
to think the best of people'

19:15.792 --> 19:19.375
but my grandmother
was a total bitch..

19:19.458 --> 19:21.875
...plain and simple.

19:21.959 --> 19:23.959
Excuse me.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.500
You'll have to forgive him.

19:29.583 --> 19:32.875
He only really knew my mom
after my father dumped her.

19:32.959 --> 19:34.625
She was different before?

19:34.709 --> 19:36.792
Proud, fearless.

19:36.875 --> 19:38.709
Only one thing scared her

19:38.792 --> 19:41.583
and she hid it
from everyone but me.

19:41.667 --> 19:42.959
- What?
- 'The dark.'

19:43.041 --> 19:47.000
Which is why it's so sad
she died in a blackout.

19:47.083 --> 19:48.458
'All alone in that pool.'

19:48.542 --> 19:50.709
She wasn't alone
if someone drowned
her.

19:50.792 --> 19:52.750
My family was dysfunctional

19:52.834 --> 19:54.125
not homicidal.

19:54.208 --> 19:55.875
'Where were you
that night, Ginny'

19:55.959 --> 19:57.417
between 12:00 and 2:00?

19:57.500 --> 20:00.875
I was asleep in my old bedroom.

20:00.959 --> 20:04.041
We know your mom threatened
to cut you off, Ginny.

20:04.125 --> 20:06.250
Well, then you must also know

20:06.333 --> 20:08.583
that I told her to go to hell.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.625
That I didn't want her money.

20:11.709 --> 20:13.959
Single mom. No visible
means
of support.

20:14.041 --> 20:15.458
(Rush)
'Maybe you circled back.'

20:15.542 --> 20:18.458
Made sure you got
what was coming to
you.

20:18.542 --> 20:20.250
You don't understand.

20:20.333 --> 20:22.291
Money wasn't what divided us.

20:22.375 --> 20:25.667
(Jeffries)
'But something did.'

20:25.750 --> 20:27.250
Something worse.

20:44.375 --> 20:47.625
I'm proud of you for
standing up for yourself,
Gin.

20:47.709 --> 20:49.500
Don't be.

20:49.583 --> 20:51.750
She's right about
the end of the month.

20:51.834 --> 20:54.875
I got a little money
if you need it.

20:54.959 --> 20:56.875
Another night of
laughs in Hell House.

20:56.959 --> 20:59.333
- Hey, that's my line.
- I remember.

20:59.417 --> 21:01.500
You always made me feel
like such a tool for saying
it.

21:01.583 --> 21:04.000
You were 13.
What did you know?

21:04.083 --> 21:05.333
Matt's 13.

21:05.417 --> 21:08.417
Bet he knows more
than you think he
does.

21:11.667 --> 21:14.917
I thought you made
your grand exit.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.625
- Snow's too deep.
- So where's Matt?

21:17.709 --> 21:18.917
(Ginny)
'I sent him up to bed'

21:19.000 --> 21:21.667
'so he wouldn't
be exposed to you.'

21:21.750 --> 21:24.041
Isn't there a belfry
somewhere you can hang

21:24.125 --> 21:25.500
upside down from?

21:25.583 --> 21:28.375
- Now I'm the vampire?
- If the cape fits.

21:29.750 --> 21:31.959
Three against one, is that it?

21:34.208 --> 21:35.667
Aren't you forgetting,
I'm not the one

21:35.750 --> 21:38.125
who destroyed
this family. He is.

21:38.208 --> 21:40.709
At least Dad doesn't lord
his money over his children.

21:40.792 --> 21:42.542
That's because
he doesn't have any, dear.

21:42.625 --> 21:45.333
- 'Cause you took it all.
- 'Half.'

21:45.417 --> 21:48.083
You squandered
the rest all on your own.

21:48.166 --> 21:52.000
I am so glad we could spend
this quality time together.

21:52.083 --> 21:55.375
We're like this because
of your father's
predilections

21:55.458 --> 21:56.625
for prepubescents.

21:56.709 --> 21:58.542
Shut up, Lauren,
before you make me do

21:58.625 --> 21:59.834
something I'll regret.

21:59.917 --> 22:02.875
Regret? That would imply
you had a conscience.

22:02.959 --> 22:05.959
I'm serious.
No one wants you here.

22:06.041 --> 22:08.667
Well, I'm not gonna let you
turn my children against me.

22:08.750 --> 22:10.208
Not with what I know about you.

22:10.291 --> 22:11.417
- Don't you--
- Pervert.

22:11.500 --> 22:13.542
You are a sick
twisted
pedophile.

22:13.625 --> 22:15.458
That's it! Come on.

22:15.542 --> 22:18.291
Enough!
Both of you just shut up!

22:18.375 --> 22:20.542
Shut up!

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
That was the last straw

22:25.083 --> 22:27.625
my mom sinking that low.

22:27.709 --> 22:28.917
What did you do?

22:29.000 --> 22:32.291
I curled up in a ball and
I drank myself to sleep.

22:32.375 --> 22:35.041
Any truth to what
your mom was saying, Ginny?

22:35.125 --> 22:36.959
About my dad? No way.

22:37.041 --> 22:38.583
You sure about that?

22:38.667 --> 22:41.625
- My dad never touched me.
- What about your brother, Tad?

22:43.250 --> 22:45.500
My dad may be
a lot of things, but--

22:45.583 --> 22:47.417
Maybe that's what
Tad was trying to tell you

22:47.500 --> 22:50.750
when he was 13.

22:50.834 --> 22:53.583
No. Absolutely not.

23:12.625 --> 23:15.583
You lose a game or somethin'?

23:15.667 --> 23:17.000
No.

23:19.125 --> 23:20.041
Then what?

23:20.125 --> 23:21.917
Girl trouble?

23:22.000 --> 23:23.834
How'd you know?

23:24.875 --> 23:27.291
I'm a detective.
What'd she do?

23:30.417 --> 23:33.250
- Think she's lying to me.
- About what?

23:35.917 --> 23:38.625
Says she's got to go
to her grandma's house

23:38.709 --> 23:41.041
instead of coming to my game.

23:42.792 --> 23:44.792
How'd she say it?

23:44.875 --> 23:47.667
She twirl her hair or
look away when she told you?

23:47.750 --> 23:49.417
No, in the eye.

23:49.500 --> 23:52.542
- Then she's telling the
truth.
- For real?

23:56.041 --> 23:58.083
Secrets of the trade.

23:58.166 --> 23:59.625
Tells.

23:59.709 --> 24:01.709
When I got
a suspect in the box..

24:01.792 --> 24:03.917
...the interrogation room..

24:04.000 --> 24:06.625
...you gotta look
for the tells.

24:06.709 --> 24:10.542
So if Leandra looked away..

24:10.625 --> 24:14.041
...then she'd be lying?

24:14.125 --> 24:16.000
Nine times out of ten.

24:23.125 --> 24:24.500
You know..

24:24.583 --> 24:26.542
...you ain't got
to be all nice to
me

24:26.625 --> 24:30.125
just 'cause...you
and my mom are..

24:30.792 --> 24:33.041
...whatever.

24:33.125 --> 24:36.125
You know about that, huh?

24:36.208 --> 24:39.834
Well, maybe you should
become a detective.

24:39.917 --> 24:42.542
Murder cop like you?

24:42.625 --> 24:44.083
Why not?

24:46.125 --> 24:48.375
Yeah.

24:48.458 --> 24:50.834
That'd be cool.

24:50.917 --> 24:52.458
Yeah, it would be.

24:53.291 --> 24:54.542
Nice!

25:05.083 --> 25:06.959
Lauren may have
been a bitch, Stan..

25:07.041 --> 25:10.291
But that's nothing compared
to what we heard about you.

25:11.959 --> 25:13.667
Do tell.

25:13.750 --> 25:15.417
Lauren called you a pervert.

25:15.500 --> 25:18.166
A sick, twisted pedophile.

25:18.250 --> 25:20.041
She would say
anything to hurt me.

25:20.125 --> 25:21.542
Which is why you
had to shut her up.

25:21.625 --> 25:22.917
Once and for all.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.375
That damn woman is
still ruining my life.

25:25.458 --> 25:27.583
So you do remember
Lauren calling you out?

25:27.667 --> 25:30.875
She could never forgive me
for cheating on her.

25:30.959 --> 25:32.250
With children?

25:32.333 --> 25:34.291
'Maybe even your own.'

25:34.375 --> 25:36.291
With younger women.

25:36.375 --> 25:38.959
Even if what
you're saying is true,
Stan..

25:40.875 --> 25:42.875
...gives you
one hell of a motive.

25:44.583 --> 25:48.250
She's smiling from
the grave, you know
that?

25:48.333 --> 25:49.625
Laughing at me.

25:49.709 --> 25:50.959
She wasn't laughing
when you drowned her.

25:51.041 --> 25:54.083
I didn't drown her.

25:54.166 --> 25:57.083
This is exactly
what she would have wanted.

25:57.166 --> 25:59.917
- 'What is?'
- Eating our own.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.750
- Turning on each other.
- Be specific.

26:04.041 --> 26:06.583
Late that night,
Lauren trained her
sights

26:06.667 --> 26:07.625
on the only one of us

26:07.709 --> 26:11.083
she hadn't sunk her fangs into.

26:15.834 --> 26:17.291
(Lauren)
'You didn't think
I'd let you go to bed'

26:17.375 --> 26:21.625
'without opening
your present, did you?'

26:21.709 --> 26:23.000
(Matt)
'This is awesome, grandma.'

26:23.083 --> 26:24.583
'Thank you.'

26:28.166 --> 26:32.041
You know, I gave Tad
a camera on his 13th birthday.

26:32.125 --> 26:34.458
Well, maybe I'll become
a photographer like him.

26:34.542 --> 26:37.917
You do and I'll take that
camera away from you right now.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.542
I forgot.
You don't like his pictures.

26:42.041 --> 26:45.834
Matt, listen,
now that you're a man

26:47.041 --> 26:48.625
there's something
I need to talk to you about.

26:48.709 --> 26:50.125
(Matt)
'Okay.'

26:50.208 --> 26:52.000
(Lauren)
'Your mother does
the best she can.'

26:52.083 --> 26:54.291
- I know that.
- Yeah.

26:54.375 --> 26:57.500
But there's a big,
wide world out there.

26:57.583 --> 26:59.750
London, Paris, Madrid.

26:59.834 --> 27:01.417
Europe. That's cool.

27:01.500 --> 27:02.959
And I wanna take you.

27:03.041 --> 27:04.500
In fact, I thought
maybe you might come

27:04.583 --> 27:06.667
and live with me for a while.

27:06.750 --> 27:08.333
Live with you?

27:11.291 --> 27:13.709
What about my mom?

27:13.792 --> 27:16.709
She wants
what's best for you too.

27:16.792 --> 27:18.166
'But she's a woman, Matt.'

27:18.250 --> 27:20.542
She needs a man in her life.

27:22.500 --> 27:24.542
What's that mean?

27:24.625 --> 27:27.000
It's not easy to meet someone

27:27.083 --> 27:29.959
with a teenage son around.

27:31.458 --> 27:34.792
'We'd have loads of fun,
I promise you.'

27:36.041 --> 27:38.083
What do you say
we go for a swim?

27:40.250 --> 27:42.291
Now?

27:42.375 --> 27:43.917
My mom said to stay up here.

27:44.000 --> 27:47.166
What your mom doesn't
know won't hurt her.

27:47.250 --> 27:49.750
Come on. Get your suit on.

28:07.625 --> 28:09.959
And that was the last time
you saw Lauren alive.

28:10.041 --> 28:11.625
Heading to the pool with Matt?

28:11.709 --> 28:15.500
I'm not saying my grandson had
anything to do with anything.

28:18.291 --> 28:20.583
He was just a boy.

28:30.166 --> 28:31.709
You went swimming
with your
grandmother

28:31.792 --> 28:33.208
the night she was killed.

28:33.291 --> 28:35.542
Never mentioned that.

28:35.625 --> 28:36.959
I don't wanna talk about this.

28:37.041 --> 28:40.166
You were the last one
to see her alive, Matt.

28:40.250 --> 28:41.208
I didn't kill her.

28:41.291 --> 28:42.208
Your grandmother was trying

28:42.291 --> 28:43.208
to turn you against your mom.

28:43.291 --> 28:45.125
Like I said, she was a shrew.

28:45.208 --> 28:47.000
But you love your mom.

28:47.083 --> 28:50.625
So you had to stop your grandma
from digging her claws in.

29:01.375 --> 29:03.375
That's not all she tried to do.

29:04.500 --> 29:06.500
Tell me, Matt.

29:06.583 --> 29:09.041
She tried to destroy me.

29:22.375 --> 29:24.750
I didn't realize
you were such a good swimmer.

29:24.834 --> 29:26.583
This was such
a great idea,
grandma.

29:26.667 --> 29:28.458
Oh, call me Lauren.

29:28.542 --> 29:31.125
"Grandma" sounds so formal.

29:31.208 --> 29:34.041
Okay.

29:34.125 --> 29:35.792
Go ahead. Say it.

29:35.875 --> 29:39.500
- Call me Lauren.
- Okay, Lauren.

29:39.583 --> 29:41.500
Now was that so hard?

29:44.083 --> 29:45.875
You're blushing.

29:45.959 --> 29:48.792
It's just kind of weird.

29:48.875 --> 29:50.000
Under those good looks

29:50.083 --> 29:52.917
you're bashful, aren't you?

29:53.000 --> 29:56.250
No.

29:56.333 --> 29:58.709
Do you have a girlfriend?

29:58.792 --> 30:01.875
- Not like a regular one.
- Good.

30:01.959 --> 30:04.041
Take it from me,
it's best to get some
experience

30:04.125 --> 30:07.083
with someone
you can trust first.

30:07.166 --> 30:09.834
- Really?
- Absolutely.

30:09.917 --> 30:13.333
Someone to teach you the ropes..

30:13.417 --> 30:15.875
...tell you where to touch..

30:15.959 --> 30:18.959
...where to feel.

30:19.041 --> 30:21.458
Don't you wanna know
what makes a woman tick?

30:23.834 --> 30:26.250
I guess.
I don't know.

30:31.583 --> 30:33.417
Matt..

30:37.500 --> 30:41.166
...look at me.
Look at me.

30:48.333 --> 30:51.208
(Tad)
'Get out of the water,
Matt.'

30:51.291 --> 30:53.333
You heard me.
Get going.

31:11.250 --> 31:14.041
Your grandmother
was seducing you?

31:16.500 --> 31:20.208
I don't know
what she was trying to do to
me.

31:22.959 --> 31:24.667
Your uncle rescued you..

31:26.709 --> 31:30.375
...leaving Tad there
alone with his
mother.

31:40.083 --> 31:42.583
Wasn't your father
who was the pedophile

31:42.667 --> 31:43.750
was it, Tad?

31:43.834 --> 31:45.792
It was your mother.

31:45.875 --> 31:48.125
(Tad)
'Don't...don't do this.'

31:48.208 --> 31:49.917
We're not saying
she didn't deserve it.

31:50.000 --> 31:53.125
Because, no doubt, you
had
your reasons for hating
her.

31:53.208 --> 31:56.125
For stopping her from doing
to Matt what she did to you.

31:56.208 --> 31:57.625
I didn't kill her.

31:57.709 --> 31:59.291
Jury will understand, Tad.

31:59.375 --> 32:01.000
Go light, under
the
circumstances.

32:01.083 --> 32:03.458
And I don't know
who did kill her, either.

32:03.542 --> 32:05.291
I swear.

32:08.250 --> 32:10.000
We know you were there..

32:10.083 --> 32:12.083
...in the dark.

32:12.166 --> 32:15.709
The last one to see her alive.

32:17.250 --> 32:19.083
What you don't understand is..

32:21.834 --> 32:24.792
...I didn't
just hate my mother.

32:24.875 --> 32:27.291
I loved her too.

32:29.875 --> 32:33.792
Which is what makes it
so twisted, so screwed up.

32:33.875 --> 32:37.166
Lot of gray.

32:37.250 --> 32:40.208
That's why I like
black and white.

32:40.291 --> 32:43.750
So what happened,
Tad, after Matt left?

32:45.625 --> 32:48.125
I confronted her..

32:48.208 --> 32:50.166
...at long last.

32:54.917 --> 32:59.000
Would you be a dear
and bring me a towel?

33:05.041 --> 33:07.208
I always thought I was bad.

33:07.291 --> 33:09.542
You know, defective.

33:09.625 --> 33:12.542
But it wasn't my fault.
You made me.

33:12.625 --> 33:13.917
'Just like
you tried to make Matt.'

33:14.000 --> 33:15.375
Oh, please.

33:15.458 --> 33:19.083
Let's not rewrite history
here tonight, shall we?

33:20.083 --> 33:22.625
I'm not saying that..

33:22.709 --> 33:24.583
...that I didn't.

33:24.667 --> 33:27.583
- That it wasn't...part of
it.
- I don't need to hear this.

33:27.667 --> 33:31.667
But what we did, I never
would've imagined possible.

33:34.000 --> 33:37.166
You are jealous..

33:37.250 --> 33:39.709
...aren't you?

33:39.792 --> 33:42.000
Of your own nephew.

33:42.083 --> 33:43.875
Because you know
what I'll give him.

33:43.959 --> 33:45.375
'Give him?'

33:45.458 --> 33:48.709
Don't you mean give
yourself?
The audience you need.

33:48.792 --> 33:50.208
I never heard any
complaints from you.

33:50.291 --> 33:53.625
- You used me!
- We used each other.

33:54.709 --> 33:57.000
You were my mother.

33:58.333 --> 34:00.250
I still am.

34:00.333 --> 34:02.709
How could you do it?

34:02.792 --> 34:05.083
How could you do that to me?

34:06.792 --> 34:08.834
How could he stop wanting me?

34:10.583 --> 34:13.166
I was still beautiful..

34:13.250 --> 34:14.792
...wasn't I?

34:14.875 --> 34:17.000
In that picture that you took.

34:18.250 --> 34:20.583
Yes, mom, you were beautiful.

34:23.166 --> 34:25.041
And what about now?

34:27.333 --> 34:29.792
Is it all gone?

34:29.875 --> 34:33.000
You're still beautiful, mom.

34:36.417 --> 34:38.291
Thank you, Tad.

34:39.792 --> 34:43.333
But you are selfish.

34:43.417 --> 34:45.625
And you are ugly on the inside.

34:47.083 --> 34:49.041
'Really ugly.'

34:51.250 --> 34:53.583
You can say what you want.

34:53.667 --> 34:56.458
No one will ever
compare with me.

34:57.667 --> 35:00.417
Not for you.

35:00.500 --> 35:02.208
Not ever.

35:10.709 --> 35:12.667
Goodbye, mother.

35:17.417 --> 35:19.166
It's funny.

35:19.250 --> 35:20.166
I walked away from her

35:20.250 --> 35:22.917
swearing I'd never
see her again.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.667
I didn't think
it'd be true, though.

35:25.750 --> 35:28.709
The lights came on?

35:28.792 --> 35:31.125
Yeah, blackout was over.

35:31.208 --> 35:34.000
But your father found
your mom the next morning

35:34.083 --> 35:37.166
with the lights off.

35:37.250 --> 35:39.583
Meaning whoever
killed Lauren
entered

35:39.667 --> 35:40.625
when the lights were on.

35:40.709 --> 35:42.709
Then turned them off.

35:43.542 --> 35:46.083
Wanted it dark for a reason.

35:52.208 --> 35:55.208
You were the only one who
knew your mom's secret, Ginny.

35:57.125 --> 35:59.834
About being afraid of the dark.

35:59.917 --> 36:02.208
So?

36:02.291 --> 36:04.542
The blackout was over.

36:04.625 --> 36:07.041
- The lights were back on.
- I don't follow.

36:07.125 --> 36:08.834
That's why you turned them off.

36:08.917 --> 36:11.125
To scare your mom.

36:11.208 --> 36:12.959
'To hurt her..'

36:13.041 --> 36:14.750
'...because of
what Matt told you.'

36:14.834 --> 36:17.917
'Cause he did
tell you, didn't he?

36:19.500 --> 36:21.375
He never told me anything.

36:22.625 --> 36:25.125
I knew just by looking at him.

36:27.041 --> 36:28.792
'Cause you saw
your brother look the same way

36:28.875 --> 36:32.166
when...he was 13?

36:33.333 --> 36:36.542
I let him down.

36:36.625 --> 36:39.333
Betrayed Tad
when he needed me most.

36:41.208 --> 36:44.709
But you weren't gonna
make the same mistake twice.

36:44.792 --> 36:48.583
My mother was
the most unhappy woman

36:48.667 --> 36:50.041
I've ever known.

36:51.875 --> 36:53.625
The only thing
that gave her
pleasure

36:53.709 --> 36:56.959
was making other people
as miserable as she was.

36:59.041 --> 37:01.250
But you weren't gonna
let her do that to Matt.

37:01.333 --> 37:03.917
I guess it doesn't
matter now, does
it?

37:05.709 --> 37:07.875
Because I did
protect my son from
her.

37:07.959 --> 37:11.125
- Yes, you did.
- And he's okay.

37:11.208 --> 37:14.208
He's better than okay.

37:14.291 --> 37:16.500
He's gonna be a doctor.

37:16.583 --> 37:18.000
'Save people.'

37:20.709 --> 37:23.083
The way I should've saved Tad.

37:36.417 --> 37:38.709
Ginny, don't be rude.

37:38.792 --> 37:41.208
Turn the lights back on.

37:42.291 --> 37:44.458
You know I don't like the dark.

37:46.583 --> 37:48.667
Yeah, mom, I know.

37:50.750 --> 37:53.667
Are you still
angry
about the money?

37:53.750 --> 37:54.667
No.

37:54.750 --> 37:55.625
'Because you know'

37:55.709 --> 37:57.500
'I'm all bark and no bite.'

37:57.583 --> 37:59.375
If only that were true.

38:03.041 --> 38:05.500
Did your brother
come talk to you?

38:07.291 --> 38:09.917
What is it with
you and men, mom?

38:11.792 --> 38:13.834
Why are they the
only ones that matter?

38:13.917 --> 38:15.792
Don't be absurd.

38:15.875 --> 38:19.667
I worshipped you
when I was a little girl.

38:19.750 --> 38:21.667
Wanted to be just like you.

38:23.166 --> 38:24.458
Now I really am going to bed.

38:24.542 --> 38:28.208
You can never see my son
again, you understand me?

38:28.291 --> 38:30.750
Poor, plain, Ginny..

38:30.834 --> 38:33.458
Always afraid
I'm gonna steal her men
away.

38:33.542 --> 38:36.333
He is not a man.
He is a 13-year-old boy.

38:36.417 --> 38:39.583
Like moths to a flame.
That's the power of
beauty.

38:39.667 --> 38:43.208
That's the power
you'll never
understand.

38:43.291 --> 38:46.000
I feel sorry for you.

38:46.083 --> 38:47.542
Poor, plain, Ginny

38:47.625 --> 38:49.792
feels sorry for me?

38:49.875 --> 38:53.625
You've never loved anyone in
your whole life except
yourself.

38:53.709 --> 38:55.208
What would you know about love?

38:55.291 --> 38:56.959
More than you'll ever will, mom.

39:00.709 --> 39:02.834
Mom, give me your hand.

39:05.291 --> 39:06.125
Mom!

39:06.208 --> 39:07.500
I don't need your help!

39:08.792 --> 39:10.792
You need somebody's help, mom.

39:10.875 --> 39:12.208
Your power's fading.

39:12.291 --> 39:15.709
You might ask
your precious son about
that.

39:22.125 --> 39:24.583
Oh, dear God.

39:24.667 --> 39:27.625
I told you I hate you.

39:27.709 --> 39:30.917
I hate you.
