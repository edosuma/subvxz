00:03.170 --> 00:05.704
So, marty, uh,
what are we celebrating?

00:05.706 --> 00:07.406
My prostate exam.

00:08.341 --> 00:11.176
Doctor gave me a thumbs up.

00:11.178 --> 00:13.579
At least it felt like a thumb.

00:13.581 --> 00:15.447
Well, I'm glad to hear
you're in good health.

00:15.449 --> 00:18.517
Yes, he said I could live
another ten years

00:18.519 --> 00:20.052
If I give up alcohol.

00:20.054 --> 00:21.620
Yeah, but you're
drinking scotch.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.188
He had a finger up my keister.

00:23.190 --> 00:24.456
What, am I gonna argue?

00:26.393 --> 00:28.060
It's true; he never complains
when I put my...

00:28.062 --> 00:29.428
(watch beeping)

00:29.430 --> 00:32.297
What is that, the horrifying
conversation alarm?

00:32.299 --> 00:33.599
(beeping continues)

00:33.601 --> 00:36.935
I was hoping it was a truck
about to back over me.

00:36.937 --> 00:38.604
It's time for my pills.

00:38.606 --> 00:40.606
Evy, I think I left them
in the car.

00:40.608 --> 00:42.207
Would you get them?
Of course, dear.

00:42.209 --> 00:44.243
I think the keys are
in my pocket.

00:44.245 --> 00:46.378
You may have to root
around for them.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.113
Really nice try.

00:48.115 --> 00:49.348
I-I got to remember that.

00:49.350 --> 00:50.816
That's a good one.

00:50.818 --> 00:54.653
You actually have
to own something to have keys.

00:54.655 --> 00:58.557
Okay, let me tell you
why I'm really here.

00:58.559 --> 01:01.627
You know I have been dating
your mother for some time now.

01:01.629 --> 01:02.961
Uh, actually,
she's not my mom.

01:02.963 --> 01:04.897
Yeah, or mine.

01:04.899 --> 01:07.099
Well, you boys are a couple
and she's your daughter,

01:07.101 --> 01:08.834
So we're like family.

01:08.836 --> 01:11.170
Oh.

01:11.172 --> 01:13.372
No, we're-we're not married.

01:13.374 --> 01:15.007
Oh, but someday.

01:15.009 --> 01:18.010
No, no, we-we don't want
to get married.

01:18.012 --> 01:20.579
So why did you guys fight
so hard for it?

01:20.581 --> 01:23.182
Yeah, come on, walden.

01:23.184 --> 01:26.318
You're here, you're queer,
get used to it.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.953
As I was saying,

01:27.955 --> 01:32.191
Your mother is a beautiful,
warm, compassionate woman.

01:32.193 --> 01:34.593
Everyone's entitled
to their opinion.

01:34.595 --> 01:37.830
I would like to ask
for her hand in marriage.

01:37.832 --> 01:39.565
Aw.
Wow.
What?

01:39.567 --> 01:41.467
So, what do you say?

01:41.469 --> 01:43.702
Can I make an honest woman
out of your mother?

01:43.704 --> 01:46.038
I doubt it.

01:47.674 --> 01:49.908
But you have my blessing.

01:49.910 --> 01:51.477
Mine, too.
Congratulations.

01:51.479 --> 01:52.945
Uh, wait, not-not so fast.

01:52.947 --> 01:54.246
I have a question first.

01:54.248 --> 01:56.982
Would you allow her son
to come and live with you

01:56.984 --> 01:58.917
If his current living
quarters were to, say,

01:58.919 --> 02:00.719
Suddenly become a sauna?

02:01.988 --> 02:03.722
Any son of evelyn's

02:03.724 --> 02:06.592
Always has a place in my home.

02:06.594 --> 02:08.961
Welcome to the family, dad.

02:08.963 --> 02:10.796
(door opens)

02:10.798 --> 02:12.364
Here are your pills, dear.

02:12.366 --> 02:15.667
Look at that, a hot chick
carrying a bag of drugs.

02:15.669 --> 02:19.471
It's like 1970 all over again.

02:20.740 --> 02:22.574
Let's start
with the muscle relaxers.

02:22.576 --> 02:24.743
One for you, two for me.

02:25.845 --> 02:27.946
Wow. What are
all those for?

02:27.948 --> 02:29.348
It's a combination.

02:29.350 --> 02:31.183
Hardeners and softeners.

02:31.185 --> 02:33.685
I-I have to take these or...

02:33.687 --> 02:35.554
(grunting)

02:36.689 --> 02:38.123
Marty, are you okay?
Quick, quick.

02:38.125 --> 02:40.592
P-press the medic alert.

02:41.528 --> 02:44.029
What is this?

02:44.031 --> 02:45.364
This is a ring.

02:46.866 --> 02:50.802
I've fallen for you,
and I can't get up.

02:50.804 --> 02:52.037
What are you saying?

02:52.039 --> 02:53.338
Will you marry me?

02:53.340 --> 02:55.741
I can't believe this.

02:55.743 --> 02:57.843
You are so romantic.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.478
Will I have to sign a prenup?

02:59.480 --> 03:00.479
Of course not.

03:00.481 --> 03:02.614
Then yes, yes.

03:02.616 --> 03:05.417
And I want your son
to be my best man.

03:05.419 --> 03:06.818
Oh, my god, really?

03:06.820 --> 03:09.354
Not you; pretty boy over there.

03:10.890 --> 03:12.357
Oh.

03:12.359 --> 03:14.426
In my heart, I knew.

03:16.229 --> 03:17.930
Okay, but at the ceremony,

03:17.932 --> 03:20.599
I'm not gonna root around
in your pocket for the ring.

03:20.601 --> 03:23.068
And, jennifer,
you'll be my maid of honor?

03:23.070 --> 03:25.771
(scoffs) of course.
It's like I'm not even here.

03:25.773 --> 03:27.873
Sweet.
I love straight weddings.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.309
A bunch
of drunk bridesmaids crying

03:30.311 --> 03:31.710
Because they don't have a man.

03:31.712 --> 03:34.580
It's like eating fish
in a barrel.

03:34.582 --> 03:36.782
So, where are we gonna have
the ceremony?

03:36.784 --> 03:38.951
Why don't we just have
it here at our place?

03:38.953 --> 03:41.019
Uh, maybe <i>we</i> should
discuss this

03:41.021 --> 03:43.522
Before <i>we</i> offer up <i>our</i> place.

03:43.524 --> 03:45.591
Do what I do;
just go along with it,

03:45.593 --> 03:48.360
And later, take it out on him
in the bedroom.

03:50.096 --> 03:52.764
♪ men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men ♪

03:52.766 --> 03:55.834

03:58.973 --> 04:00.906
Oh, berta, uh,

04:00.908 --> 04:02.374
Can I try something out on you?

04:02.376 --> 04:04.943
There isn't enough
alcohol in the world.

04:04.945 --> 04:07.346
No, I'm writing a toast
for my mother's wedding.

04:07.348 --> 04:08.647
Uh, so far I've got, uh,

04:08.649 --> 04:10.282
"ladies and gentlemen,
I am so pleased

04:10.284 --> 04:11.917
"to welcome marty pepper
to our family.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.719
"uh, to know marty
is to love him.

04:13.721 --> 04:15.787
"he's a kind,
sweet and generous man,

04:15.789 --> 04:17.122
"which proves once and for all

04:17.124 --> 04:19.291
That opposites
really do attract."

04:19.293 --> 04:22.361
So, you're telling everyone
you're a son of a bitch.

04:23.463 --> 04:24.730
I like it.

04:26.132 --> 04:27.699
Hey, alan, I need your help

04:27.701 --> 04:29.801
Planning this geriatric
bachelor party.

04:29.803 --> 04:31.303
I started reaching out
to the guys

04:31.305 --> 04:32.604
On marty's invite list,

04:32.606 --> 04:36.842
And so far I got dead,
dead, coma, florida.

04:36.844 --> 04:39.745
Hey, uh, where you thinking
about having this thing anyway?

04:39.747 --> 04:41.313
Well, at this point, either boca

04:41.315 --> 04:43.982
Or the
hollywood forever cemetery.

04:43.984 --> 04:45.584
How about a strip club?

04:45.586 --> 04:47.586
I know a place with a great
all-you-can-eat buffet.

04:47.588 --> 04:49.421
Two things you never
want to hear together.
Mm-hmm.

04:49.423 --> 04:51.189
"strip club" and
"all-you-can-eat."

04:51.191 --> 04:53.592
Besides, marty doesn't
want strippers.

04:53.594 --> 04:55.227
You can't have a bachelor party
without strippers.

04:55.229 --> 04:56.561
But more importantly,

04:56.563 --> 04:58.463
We can't let the last
naked woman this man sees

04:58.465 --> 04:59.598
Be my mother.

05:01.100 --> 05:04.102
My granddaughters do
a great two-for-one show.

05:04.104 --> 05:05.737
I can get you a family discount.

05:05.739 --> 05:07.906
No, no.

05:07.908 --> 05:09.141
We... No strippers.

05:09.143 --> 05:11.243
We're just doing
a nice steak dinner.

05:11.245 --> 05:12.544
Well, if there's not
gonna be any strippers,

05:12.546 --> 05:13.578
Then I'm not going.

05:13.580 --> 05:15.347
Actually,
you're not on the list.

05:15.349 --> 05:17.482
♪ <i>men.</i> ♪

05:17.484 --> 05:19.217
Okay, okay,
one more time.

05:19.219 --> 05:22.821
I want a nice filet,
medium-rare,

05:22.823 --> 05:24.856
And then you give
it a nice sear,

05:24.858 --> 05:27.793
And then you put it
in the food processor,

05:27.795 --> 05:29.328
And you give it a pump

05:29.330 --> 05:31.463
Three times on chop--
boom, boom, boom--

05:31.465 --> 05:33.799
And two times on
dice-- boom, boom.

05:33.801 --> 05:35.701
Thank you.

05:36.669 --> 05:38.337
Oh, uh,

05:38.339 --> 05:39.905
Is, uh, this the party

05:39.907 --> 05:41.440
Or the bathroom?

05:41.442 --> 05:43.308
Here. Over here, tim.

05:43.310 --> 05:44.476
Oh.
Yeah.

05:44.478 --> 05:46.011
Thank you.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.145
What's with the glasses?

05:47.147 --> 05:48.780
You look like bono.

05:48.782 --> 05:51.083
I was fortunate enough
to work with bono.

05:51.085 --> 05:54.519
Yeah, and, uh, at the time,
he was married to cher.

05:55.788 --> 05:57.923
I just got back
from the eye doctor.

05:57.925 --> 06:00.859
Boy, he robbed me blind.

06:00.861 --> 06:04.229
I can only read the top
line of the eye chart.

06:04.231 --> 06:06.064
It says p.

06:06.066 --> 06:08.867
Then I have to.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.536
I-I'd like to, uh,
to propose a toast.

06:11.538 --> 06:13.004
Uh, first to walden

06:13.006 --> 06:15.073
For putting all this together
at the last minute.

06:15.075 --> 06:17.409
Well, it was tough,
but I managed to get a table

06:17.411 --> 06:20.112
At 3:00 p.M. On a Thursday.

06:20.114 --> 06:23.315
To walden and his wife alan.

06:25.284 --> 06:27.486
That is one ugly woman.

06:27.488 --> 06:28.553
Uh-huh.

06:28.555 --> 06:31.056
Um, my, uh,

06:31.058 --> 06:33.392
My mother and I have
had our ups and downs,

06:33.394 --> 06:36.261
But I love her,
and I want her to be happy.

06:36.263 --> 06:38.330
And you, marty pepper,

06:38.332 --> 06:40.232
Make her happy,
which means

06:40.234 --> 06:41.600
I love you.

06:42.969 --> 06:45.704
I thought we
said no broads.

06:47.173 --> 06:49.441
I had a gay friend
who was arrested for sodomy,

06:49.443 --> 06:53.578
And he had the charge reduced
to following too closely.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.580
Uh, anyway,

06:55.582 --> 06:59.017
Um, I want to wish you both
the best. Cheers.

06:59.019 --> 07:00.318
Tim needs a drink.

07:00.320 --> 07:03.855
No, no, no, no, uh, I'm driving.

07:03.857 --> 07:05.991
Marty, last time I saw you,

07:05.993 --> 07:10.128
We were in a threesome
with that cute little redhead.

07:10.130 --> 07:12.097
What ever happened to her?

07:12.099 --> 07:13.432
I'm marrying her.

07:13.434 --> 07:15.133
Nice girl.

07:15.135 --> 07:16.935
Hard worker.

07:18.604 --> 07:21.740
Well, I'd like to say on behalf
of all of us, getting married?

07:21.742 --> 07:23.942
What the hell are
you doing, marty?

07:23.944 --> 07:25.744
Why do you need
seven wives?

07:25.746 --> 07:29.381
You can barely get through
nine holes of golf!

07:29.383 --> 07:33.185
She's a sweet kid,
and I need a little warmth

07:33.187 --> 07:35.620
And comfort
at the end of the day.

07:35.622 --> 07:39.057
Have you ever considered
a nice piece of toast?

07:40.460 --> 07:42.961
(clears throat) uh, well,
I would like to say something.

07:42.963 --> 07:46.198
Uh... I might be
in the minority here,

07:46.200 --> 07:48.467
But I still believe in love,

07:48.469 --> 07:50.735
And it's inspiring to know

07:50.737 --> 07:53.972
That even at your age,
you can still find it.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.974
Now we have two broads.

07:57.643 --> 07:59.311
The kid is right.

07:59.313 --> 08:02.614
Nothing is more important
than love,

08:02.616 --> 08:05.217
Except a good opening weekend.

08:05.219 --> 08:07.719
And salt.

08:08.988 --> 08:12.057
Damn it, I really miss salt.

08:12.059 --> 08:14.693
Okay, we're here because
we love this man.

08:14.695 --> 08:17.395
You know, not the way
you two love each other.

08:17.397 --> 08:19.364
But...

08:19.366 --> 08:21.666
Love, n-nonetheless.

08:23.636 --> 08:26.571
We're also here for the free
steak, am I right? (chuckles)

08:26.573 --> 08:29.641
Excuse me.

08:29.643 --> 08:31.076
Who is this kid?

08:31.078 --> 08:33.044
He's evelyn's son.

08:33.046 --> 08:35.080
Who's evelyn?

08:35.082 --> 08:36.581
The woman I'm marrying.

08:36.583 --> 08:38.316
You're getting married?

08:38.318 --> 08:41.186
Mazel tov!

08:43.422 --> 08:45.724
Which one of you guys
is... Marty?

08:49.529 --> 08:50.896
I'm sugar.

08:50.898 --> 08:51.863
I'm cinnamon.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.566
I'm rich!
I'm richer!

08:54.568 --> 08:56.835
Hey, I thought we said
no strippers.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.303
It's a bachelor party;
loosen up.

08:58.305 --> 08:59.971
Hey, uh, marty,
you up for a lap dance?

08:59.973 --> 09:02.574
I haven't been up
for a lap dance

09:02.576 --> 09:05.477
Since the
reagan administration.

09:05.479 --> 09:07.445
Governor reagan's.

09:07.447 --> 09:09.981
I think I wrote that joke.

09:09.983 --> 09:12.484
Girls, give him something
to remember.

09:12.486 --> 09:14.553
Uh, they're the green ones.

09:15.488 --> 09:17.155
Oh, uh, and don't forget,

09:17.157 --> 09:18.957
I'm only paying for an hour,
so whether you're

09:18.959 --> 09:20.592

Marty,

18:44.858 --> 18:46.757
Come find the ducky.

18:46.759 --> 18:48.092
(giggling)

18:48.094 --> 18:50.495
We-we should probably go
break the news to them.

18:50.497 --> 18:53.431
Yeah, yeah, that'd probably be
the proper thing to do.

18:54.833 --> 18:56.067
Just so you know,

18:56.069 --> 18:58.302
This is not happening
when we're married.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.505

19:05.345 --> 19:07.011
Marty,

19:07.013 --> 19:09.714
I love you more than words
could ever say.

19:09.716 --> 19:11.349
From the moment

19:11.351 --> 19:13.718
I took off my blindfold,
turned around

19:13.720 --> 19:16.554
And saw you behind me
for the first time,

19:16.556 --> 19:20.091
I knew I'd never need
a safe word again.

19:21.026 --> 19:23.528
I wish I had
one of those right now.

19:23.530 --> 19:25.696
Which? The blindfold
or the safe word?

19:25.698 --> 19:28.199
Yes.

19:28.201 --> 19:31.903
Evelyn, I'm so happy
you're in my life.

19:31.905 --> 19:34.805
When I'm with you,
I feel like I'm 85 again.

19:34.807 --> 19:37.041
You're the perfect
girl for me.

19:37.043 --> 19:38.743
You make my heart skip a beat,

19:38.745 --> 19:41.979
And you know how to use
a defribrillator.

19:41.981 --> 19:43.314
(laughter)

19:43.316 --> 19:46.484
I wrote that joke.

19:46.486 --> 19:48.886
Last night, I only got up
one time to pee.

19:50.589 --> 19:53.624
I peed a second time,
but I-I didn't get up.

19:57.162 --> 19:59.430
Ashes to ashes,

19:59.432 --> 20:00.865
And dust to dust...

20:00.867 --> 20:03.167
Oh, I'm sorry.
I skipped a page there.

20:03.169 --> 20:04.569
Uh...

20:04.571 --> 20:06.637
You may now kiss the bride.

20:13.278 --> 20:16.547
Congratulations, evelyn,
on a beautiful ceremony.

20:16.549 --> 20:19.417
Yeah. Can't wait
for the next one.

20:20.285 --> 20:21.752
I just have to tell you,

20:21.754 --> 20:24.055
I am a huge fan.
Thank you very much.

20:24.057 --> 20:26.657
I lost my virginity
to one of your records.

20:26.659 --> 20:29.627
A-side and b-side,
if you know what I mean.

20:29.629 --> 20:31.162
(laughs)

20:31.164 --> 20:34.298
Oh, I just became
a big fan of yours, baby.

20:34.300 --> 20:35.433
(laughs)

20:35.435 --> 20:38.302
And I just want
to say one thing.

20:38.304 --> 20:42.073
None of this would've happened
without these two.

20:42.075 --> 20:44.308
And as my present to you,

20:44.310 --> 20:47.011
I've arranged for tim

20:47.013 --> 20:50.648
To perform
one more wedding ceremony.

20:50.650 --> 20:53.718
(applause)

20:55.487 --> 20:58.356
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

20:58.358 --> 21:01.359
Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.
