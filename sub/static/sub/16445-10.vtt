WEBVTT

00:00.735 --> 00:02.668
- Previously on Gotham...
- Oh, no.

00:03.323 --> 00:05.623
Help me, help me! Somebody help!

00:05.658 --> 00:08.802
They think she might've
fallen asleep at the wheel.

00:08.850 --> 00:10.160
Her brake lines were cut!

00:10.208 --> 00:12.174
Which leaves one conclusion: murder.

00:12.210 --> 00:14.743
And I know who did it.

00:14.779 --> 00:16.912
Hold on, Butch.

00:16.948 --> 00:19.215
I might be in trouble.
I stole a necklace.

00:19.250 --> 00:20.816
Why is this necklace so important?

00:20.851 --> 00:22.284
What makes someone kill for it?

00:22.320 --> 00:24.086
- What is it?
- A key.

00:24.121 --> 00:25.554
We need to go somewhere.

00:25.590 --> 00:26.655
Go to my house.

00:26.691 --> 00:28.090
You two are a couple now?

00:28.125 --> 00:29.758
- No.
- Yes.

00:30.595 --> 00:31.860
My engagement announcement is

00:31.896 --> 00:33.195
coming out in The Gazette tomorrow,

00:33.231 --> 00:36.198
and it will feature Mario's
name, his family name.

00:36.234 --> 00:39.101
You mean Falcone?

00:40.214 --> 00:42.504
Such a beautiful space
for a rehearsal dinner.

00:42.540 --> 00:44.173
We can't thank you enough.

00:44.208 --> 00:47.309
And did Roberto's food
live up to all my hype?

00:47.345 --> 00:48.711
Are you kidding?

00:48.746 --> 00:50.713
Ugh, any more burrata,
and I wouldn't fit

00:50.748 --> 00:53.582
into my wedding dress.

00:53.618 --> 00:55.451
Can't believe we're getting
married in two days.

00:55.486 --> 00:56.685
Have you two settled on a, uh,

00:56.721 --> 00:58.631
honeymoon destination?

00:58.683 --> 00:59.577
Uh, no.

00:59.641 --> 01:02.224
But Lee finally agreed to
take some time off of work.

01:02.260 --> 01:03.792
With everything going on, I
didn't want to leave anybody

01:03.828 --> 01:05.060
in the lurch.

01:05.096 --> 01:07.696
I was very sorry to hear
about Captain Barnes.

01:07.732 --> 01:09.131
He's a good man.

01:09.166 --> 01:12.234
What he did was due
entirely to the virus.

01:12.270 --> 01:14.937
What's truly frightening
is that nobody knew.

01:14.972 --> 01:16.171
Nobody could see it.

01:16.207 --> 01:17.606
There aren't any symptoms?

01:17.642 --> 01:19.675
Well, looking back
now, there were signs.

01:19.710 --> 01:22.244
Increased strength,
emotional instability...

01:22.280 --> 01:23.812
Nothing he couldn't hide.

01:23.848 --> 01:25.447
The lab analyzing

01:25.483 --> 01:27.082
Alice Tetch's blood has developed a test

01:27.118 --> 01:28.217
to see if someone's infected.

01:28.252 --> 01:29.618
You're kidding? When?

01:29.654 --> 01:30.953
They just finished.

01:30.988 --> 01:32.988
It's a step toward finding a cure.

01:34.025 --> 01:35.124
How are we? Good?

01:35.159 --> 01:36.258
Wonderful, Roberto.

01:36.294 --> 01:38.093
We can't wait for tomorrow night.

01:38.129 --> 01:40.996
Oh, your rehearsal dinner's
gonna be fantastico.

01:41.032 --> 01:42.731
We're gonna take care of everything.

01:42.767 --> 01:44.099
It's a privilege to serve you again,

01:44.135 --> 01:45.734
Don Falcone.

Don Falcone, please.

01:57.782 --> 01:59.214
We'll pull your car around.

01:59.250 --> 02:00.482
Ah, okay.

02:00.518 --> 02:02.384
Wonderful evening, Roberto.

02:02.420 --> 02:04.019
You betcha.

02:06.123 --> 02:08.023
I love you.

02:08.059 --> 02:09.657
I love you too.

02:25.343 --> 02:27.476
You don't understand anything, okay?

02:27.511 --> 02:29.345
My friend got blown up.

02:29.380 --> 02:31.146
And I want to know what happened?

02:31.182 --> 02:32.514
Can you explain that to me?

02:42.460 --> 02:45.327
We need to talk.

02:45.363 --> 02:48.063
Is everyone okay?

02:48.099 --> 02:49.665
A few first degree burns, but that's it.

02:49.700 --> 02:50.866
They're lucky.

02:50.901 --> 02:52.434
Any idea who might've done this?

02:52.470 --> 02:54.870
I've made my share of
enemies over the years.

02:54.905 --> 02:56.338
Could be anyone.

02:56.374 --> 02:58.340
Why come after you now?

02:58.376 --> 02:59.942
My oldest son is getting married.

02:59.977 --> 03:01.944
When better to settle an old score

03:01.979 --> 03:03.078
and hurt me and my family?

03:03.114 --> 03:04.079
Maybe.

03:04.115 --> 03:05.781
Or maybe someone thinks

03:05.816 --> 03:07.349
you're coming out of retirement?

03:07.385 --> 03:08.884
I'm not.

03:08.919 --> 03:10.419
Good.

03:10.454 --> 03:13.255
Doesn't mean I'm gonna stand
by after something like this.

03:13.290 --> 03:16.492
The captain of police was
just indicted for murder

03:16.527 --> 03:17.559
and sent to Arkham.

03:17.595 --> 03:19.628
The last thing I need
is you and your men

03:19.663 --> 03:22.264
tearing up Gotham looking for revenge.

03:22.299 --> 03:25.134
I didn't start this.

03:25.169 --> 03:27.569
I'll get to the bottom of it.

03:27.605 --> 03:29.905
You have my word.

03:31.942 --> 03:33.942
I'll give you one day.

03:43.254 --> 03:46.321
As members of the Five Families,

03:46.357 --> 03:47.589
you are well aware that

03:47.625 --> 03:50.426
with the tragic downfall
of Captain Barnes,

03:50.461 --> 03:52.561
people are frightened.

03:52.596 --> 03:55.764
They will be looking
to us for stability.

03:55.800 --> 03:58.000
To feel safe.

03:58.035 --> 03:59.735
So...

03:59.770 --> 04:04.239
how does a 50% increase
on protection fees sound?

04:05.543 --> 04:06.675
Sounds a little steep to me.

04:06.710 --> 04:08.744
What do we have here?

04:08.779 --> 04:10.512
Little family reunion?

04:10.548 --> 04:12.848
- My invitation get lost in the mail?
- No.

04:12.883 --> 04:14.616
This meeting is for grown-ups,

04:14.652 --> 04:16.851
so I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

04:16.887 --> 04:18.420
Hmm. Quick question.

04:20.925 --> 04:22.958
Is it, "How do I commit suicide?"

04:22.993 --> 04:25.127
Because that answer is coming.

04:25.162 --> 04:27.529
Tabitha and Butch are
missing. Where are they?

04:27.565 --> 04:29.431
I have no idea.

04:29.467 --> 04:32.067
I have not seen Butch since his little

04:32.102 --> 04:34.703
summer stock revival
of the Red Hood Gang.

04:34.738 --> 04:36.638
Let's cut the crap, shall we?

04:36.674 --> 04:38.140
Tabitha has been helping Butch hide

04:38.175 --> 04:39.541
since your little victory celebration.

04:39.577 --> 04:41.243
They're an item now.

04:41.278 --> 04:42.845
Barf. She's supposed to
check in every night,

04:42.880 --> 04:43.979
and she hasn't.

04:44.014 --> 04:45.180
She's not answering her phone

04:45.216 --> 04:47.149
and no one has seen her.

04:47.184 --> 04:48.717
And you think I took them?

04:48.752 --> 04:49.952
Obviously.

04:52.289 --> 04:53.989
How about this?

04:54.024 --> 04:55.524
You lower your gun

04:55.559 --> 04:58.360
and beg my forgiveness

04:58.395 --> 05:00.629
for this gross insubordination,

05:00.664 --> 05:03.198
and I might let you
walk out of here alive.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.746
My apologies.

05:17.781 --> 05:20.849
They must've run off
somewhere without telling me.

05:22.653 --> 05:23.919
Love...

05:23.954 --> 05:26.388
makes people do crazy
things, doesn't it?

05:27.591 --> 05:30.158
We have a history,

05:30.194 --> 05:31.760
you and I.

05:31.795 --> 05:34.830
But if you ever point a gun at me again,

05:34.865 --> 05:38.200
Olga will be cleaning
your brains off the floor.

05:39.970 --> 05:42.938
She's a real whiz with stains.

05:42.973 --> 05:44.973
Bye, Pengy.

05:47.912 --> 05:49.144
Everyone out.

05:49.179 --> 05:51.413
Now.

05:55.953 --> 05:57.619
Are you checking up on me?

05:57.655 --> 05:59.721
What? No.

05:59.757 --> 06:01.256
Barbara Kean was just here.

06:01.292 --> 06:02.624
She's looking for them.

06:02.660 --> 06:03.625
So?

06:03.661 --> 06:04.626
So...

06:04.662 --> 06:06.528
are you finished yet?

06:06.564 --> 06:07.629
We've talked about this.

06:07.665 --> 06:09.364
I need to work through my grief,

06:09.400 --> 06:10.666
my way.

06:10.701 --> 06:11.667
Of course.

06:11.702 --> 06:13.535
And I support you.

06:13.571 --> 06:17.506
Any chance you could work
through it a smidge faster?

06:17.541 --> 06:20.242
I am swamped today.

06:26.050 --> 06:28.083
Sorry you had to hear that.

06:28.118 --> 06:31.887
He can just be so self-centered.

06:31.922 --> 06:32.955
What were we talking about?

06:32.990 --> 06:34.089
I'm gonna kill you!

06:34.124 --> 06:35.324
Oh, right, how I found you.

06:36.694 --> 06:39.161
Well...

06:39.196 --> 06:41.029
it wasn't hard.

06:41.065 --> 06:43.165
The next time you want to disappear,

06:43.200 --> 06:44.833
consider taking a sabbatical
from your favorite restaurant.

06:44.868 --> 06:46.468
Your love of Gusto's eggplant parmesan

06:46.503 --> 06:48.003
isn't exactly a state secret.

06:48.038 --> 06:50.572
Come here.

06:50.608 --> 06:53.575
That, with a healthy amount
of Midazolam in your food

06:53.611 --> 06:54.843
to knock you out, 100 bucks

06:54.878 --> 06:56.745
to your delivery boy, who by the way,

06:56.780 --> 07:00.215
I get the feeling hasn't been
being tipped very well, Butch.

07:03.920 --> 07:04.920
I'm sorry, what was that?

07:07.257 --> 07:08.590
You're gonna regret this.

07:08.626 --> 07:10.292
You touch one hair

07:10.327 --> 07:12.194
on her head, I swear I'll kill you.

07:12.229 --> 07:13.395
Save your strength, big guy.

07:13.430 --> 07:15.130
You're gonna need it.

07:15.165 --> 07:18.033
You tell Penguin he's a coward!

07:18.068 --> 07:20.235
If he wants me dead, he should come here

07:20.270 --> 07:22.204
and do it like a man.

07:23.273 --> 07:28.110
This has nothing to do with Penguin.

07:28.145 --> 07:29.411
And you...

07:29.446 --> 07:31.713
are the coward.

07:31.749 --> 07:34.049
Killing an innocent woman.

07:34.084 --> 07:35.050
What?

07:35.085 --> 07:36.051
Who?

07:36.086 --> 07:38.387
Isabella.

07:38.422 --> 07:41.256
She was my everything,
and you took her from me.

07:41.291 --> 07:44.526
What in the hell are you talking about?

07:46.630 --> 07:50.432
I was hoping you'd be difficult.

08:02.713 --> 08:05.747
Hey. You okay?

08:05.783 --> 08:06.882
Stomach.

08:06.917 --> 08:08.250
If being acting captain

08:08.285 --> 08:10.085
is such of a strain, why do it?

08:10.120 --> 08:12.387
I'm the senior guy around here.

08:12.423 --> 08:13.755
- What about Tuttle?
- Tuttle?

08:13.791 --> 08:16.091
Guy shot a cat last week.

08:16.126 --> 08:17.192
On purpose?

08:17.227 --> 08:18.760
Does it matter?

08:18.796 --> 08:20.829
Look, I might not have always
seen eye-to-eye with Barnes,

08:20.864 --> 08:22.998
but he was a good captain.

08:23.033 --> 08:24.433
Least I can do is keep his seat warm

08:24.468 --> 08:27.102
until they find some kind
of cure for this virus.

08:27.137 --> 08:28.270
Detective Gordon.

08:28.305 --> 08:29.738
Car bomb used a mercury switch

08:29.773 --> 08:31.506
with military-grade plastic.

08:31.542 --> 08:35.110
That's kind of high-end for a mob hit.

08:35.145 --> 08:36.477
That's not all.

08:36.513 --> 08:38.679
The explosive was laced with
some sort of accelerant.

08:38.716 --> 08:41.683
Made the explosion burn at ten
times the heat of standard C-4.

08:41.719 --> 08:44.386
Whoever set this bomb didn't
want anything left behind.

08:44.421 --> 08:45.520
Only one guy I know with

08:45.556 --> 08:46.988
that level of expertise.

08:47.024 --> 08:48.657
Ex-military nut job.

08:48.692 --> 08:51.126
Goes by the name of "Fuse".

08:57.167 --> 09:00.235
- This is our guy.
- Not for nothing,

09:00.270 --> 09:01.503
but ensuring Don Falcone's safety

09:01.538 --> 09:03.872
is not why I wear the badge.

09:03.907 --> 09:06.174
- Well, it's not just about him.
- You mean Lee.

09:06.210 --> 09:08.009
If you're worried, you
could tell her not to marry

09:08.045 --> 09:10.946
the son of a former crime boss.

09:15.619 --> 09:16.619
GCPD!

09:26.563 --> 09:28.430
Dead but still warm.

09:28.465 --> 09:31.066
Whoever did this must've just left.

09:31.101 --> 09:32.667
So whoever hired Fuse to plant the bomb

09:32.703 --> 09:34.169
doesn't want any loose ends?

09:34.204 --> 09:37.172
Looks like he was on
his way out of town.

09:37.207 --> 09:39.441
Must've figured his employers
weren't that forgiving.

09:39.476 --> 09:40.976
Guy can pack,

09:41.011 --> 09:42.477
I'll give him that much.

09:42.513 --> 09:44.212
Once a soldier, always a soldier.

09:45.516 --> 09:48.083
Bed sheets aren't tucked in.

09:54.792 --> 09:56.758
Times,

09:56.794 --> 10:01.029
locations, surveillance photos.

10:01.064 --> 10:02.731
This doesn't make any sense.

10:02.766 --> 10:03.899
What?

10:03.934 --> 10:07.202
Carmine's not the target.

10:28.826 --> 10:30.492
Down!

10:38.535 --> 10:40.635
What the hell's going on?

10:40.671 --> 10:42.470
Carmine's not the target.

10:42.506 --> 10:44.506
You are.

10:53.114 --> 10:54.714
There you are. Voila.

10:54.749 --> 10:56.349
Thank you very much, Master Bruce.

10:56.384 --> 10:57.516
What is this?

10:57.552 --> 10:58.517
That is a

10:58.553 --> 11:00.553
Pennyworth signature frittata.

11:01.756 --> 11:03.356
It's a crustless quiche.

11:04.492 --> 11:05.591
It's eggs, miss. Just...

11:05.626 --> 11:07.093
Just eat it, will you?

11:07.128 --> 11:09.862
Where's your mate, anyway?

11:09.897 --> 11:11.097
Conservatory.

11:11.132 --> 11:12.865
Girl loves it there.

11:12.900 --> 11:14.500
Well, she's hardly what you call

11:14.535 --> 11:15.735
a girl,

11:15.770 --> 11:17.269
- is she?
- Yeah.

11:17.305 --> 11:20.673
Well, thanks for the crustless

11:20.708 --> 11:22.775
egg thing, but I got errands to run.

11:22.810 --> 11:24.110
Uh no, sorry, miss. No one is to

11:24.145 --> 11:25.611
leave the house, until we find exactly

11:25.646 --> 11:27.380
who is following you.

11:27.415 --> 11:29.515
It's been days, I can't take it anymore.

11:29.550 --> 11:31.851
I'm sorry, what is it
exactly that you object to?

11:31.886 --> 11:33.052
Is it the gourmet food
or the king-sized,

11:33.087 --> 11:34.487
double bed with the Egyptian linen?

11:34.522 --> 11:35.688
Would you tell the help here

11:35.723 --> 11:37.857
that I can come and go
as I please, please?

11:37.892 --> 11:39.258
Alfred's right.

11:39.293 --> 11:41.127
It's not safe for you
to be in Gotham alone.

11:41.162 --> 11:44.497
I've been in Gotham,
alone, my whole life.

11:44.532 --> 11:48.000
I can take care of
myself. Nothing's changed.

11:48.035 --> 11:51.003
Yeah. You've made that clear.

11:51.038 --> 11:52.772
What's that supposed to mean?

11:52.807 --> 11:54.774
Nothing.

11:54.809 --> 11:55.941
Those men were willing
to kill for this key.

11:55.977 --> 11:57.943
We need to know why.
I'll be in the study.

11:57.979 --> 12:00.413
There's more books I
haven't gone through.

12:00.448 --> 12:02.248
There has to be a reference
to the key somewhere.

12:02.283 --> 12:05.317
And have you stopped to consider
that maybe it's just an old key?

12:05.353 --> 12:07.019
No.

12:21.135 --> 12:22.568
I'll get you some breakfast, miss.

12:22.603 --> 12:24.970
You know, some of these plants would do

12:25.006 --> 12:27.706
much better in direct sunlight.

12:27.742 --> 12:29.141
Could you turn off the alarm

12:29.177 --> 12:30.810
so I can put them outside?

12:30.845 --> 12:32.311
Well, maybe later.

12:32.346 --> 12:34.046
I'd rather not you be walking
around the grounds on your own.

12:37.218 --> 12:39.018
Can you smell this?

12:39.053 --> 12:41.687
Beg your pardon?

12:42.757 --> 12:44.723
Right here.

12:50.998 --> 12:52.998
Oh, what is that?

12:53.034 --> 12:53.999
Just a mix of clove,

12:54.035 --> 12:57.937
fenugreek and yarrow root oils.

12:57.972 --> 12:59.538
It's lovely.

12:59.574 --> 13:00.773
It is, isn't it?

13:00.808 --> 13:02.475
- Yeah.
- Now,

13:02.510 --> 13:04.677
I need you to tell me something, okay?

13:05.713 --> 13:07.480
Anything.

13:07.515 --> 13:10.015
How do you turn off the alarm?

13:16.457 --> 13:17.623
This doesn't make any sense.

13:17.658 --> 13:20.192
Do you know anyone who
might want you dead?

13:20.228 --> 13:21.994
You can't be serious.

13:22.029 --> 13:23.829
- Everyone has enemies.
- No, Detective.

13:23.865 --> 13:25.564
- They don't.
- Regardless,

13:25.600 --> 13:26.799
you need to limit your exposure.

13:26.834 --> 13:28.167
Lay low for a while,

13:28.202 --> 13:29.668
until I can find out who's behind this.

13:29.704 --> 13:31.170
How do you propose I do that?

13:31.205 --> 13:33.806
I'm picking up our wedding
rings this afternoon.

13:33.841 --> 13:35.441
Lee and I are getting married tomorrow.

13:36.511 --> 13:38.110
Oh.

13:38.145 --> 13:40.412
You want me to cancel the wedding.

13:40.448 --> 13:41.413
I just want to keep you safe.

13:41.449 --> 13:43.082
I'd bet you'd love that.

13:43.117 --> 13:44.450
I run home to Lee,

13:44.485 --> 13:46.552
tell her we need to hide
until Detective Gordon can

13:46.587 --> 13:48.721
- save the day?
- This is not a time for ego.

13:48.756 --> 13:50.256
Oh, you're talking to me about ego?

13:51.726 --> 13:54.493
How do I even know you're
gonna be able to find him?

13:54.529 --> 13:56.095
Or that you'll even try?

13:56.130 --> 13:57.897
You need to trust me.

13:57.932 --> 14:00.432
Whoever is behind this
is gonna keep coming

14:00.468 --> 14:02.801
until they get the job done.

14:02.837 --> 14:05.104
If that's true,

14:05.139 --> 14:08.073
it doesn't matter where
we go or what we do.

14:08.109 --> 14:10.075
As long as I got a target on my back,

14:10.111 --> 14:11.777
Lee isn't safe.

14:18.286 --> 14:19.785
- Hey.
- Yeah?

14:20.788 --> 14:22.955
Keep an eye on Mario.
Don't let him leave.

14:23.790 --> 14:24.790
What are you doing?

14:24.825 --> 14:26.358
I'm keeping an eye on Mario.

14:26.394 --> 14:27.593
Don't look at him.

14:27.628 --> 14:29.028
What the hell's going on?

14:29.063 --> 14:30.262
I don't know, something doesn't fit.

14:30.298 --> 14:32.131
I need to talk to Carmine.

14:32.166 --> 14:33.732
Maybe once he knows Mario is the target,

14:33.768 --> 14:37.369
something will jog his memory. Just...

14:37.405 --> 14:38.370
- Just keep it...
- I... yeah.

14:38.406 --> 14:40.105
I got it.

14:49.750 --> 14:51.450
Hello, comrade.

14:51.485 --> 14:54.553
Comrade is not a Russian word.

14:54.589 --> 14:56.455
Oh, shut up, of course it is.

14:56.490 --> 14:57.923
You shouldn't be here.

14:57.959 --> 15:00.225
Relax. I know Penguin's
out for a few hours.

15:01.429 --> 15:03.095
I just want to talk.

15:03.130 --> 15:04.930
I don't know anything.

15:04.966 --> 15:06.298
Listen,

15:06.334 --> 15:08.934
I grew up in a place like this.

15:08.970 --> 15:10.803
A large staff of people

15:10.838 --> 15:13.072
always coming and going.

15:13.107 --> 15:14.506
Listening.

15:14.542 --> 15:18.177
You can't help but overhear things.

15:18.212 --> 15:21.013
Is handsome ring.

15:21.048 --> 15:23.649
It is. And very expensive.

15:24.852 --> 15:26.585
I bet it would look
just fabulous on you.

15:32.126 --> 15:33.359
Mr. Penguin,

15:33.394 --> 15:34.994
he treat me nice.

15:35.029 --> 15:37.663
I have warm feeling for him.

15:37.698 --> 15:39.598
But the other one...

15:39.634 --> 15:40.833
Nygma?

15:40.868 --> 15:43.335
Don't know why Mr. Penguin

15:43.371 --> 15:45.270
likes him so much.

15:45.306 --> 15:47.172
He could do better.

15:47.208 --> 15:48.507
Wait.

15:48.542 --> 15:50.442
You mean likes, likes?

15:51.846 --> 15:53.412
Wow. Okay, we should definitely

15:53.447 --> 15:55.314
revisit that another time.

15:55.349 --> 15:56.715
But what about Nygma?

15:56.751 --> 15:58.350
Does he say anything
about my missing friend?

15:58.386 --> 15:59.718
Mm. I don't know,

15:59.754 --> 16:01.453
but I hear Mr. Nygma

16:01.489 --> 16:02.888
talking about

16:02.923 --> 16:06.225
special delivery, but nothing

16:06.260 --> 16:07.226
come to the house

16:07.261 --> 16:09.461
but bill.

16:11.565 --> 16:13.399
"Stocks & Bondage"?

16:21.342 --> 16:23.242
Mm.

16:23.277 --> 16:25.144
How many times do I have to tell you?

16:25.179 --> 16:27.079
I have never...

16:27.114 --> 16:28.747
even heard of this woman.

16:28.783 --> 16:32.017
Well,

16:32.053 --> 16:34.019
then I suppose I should

16:34.055 --> 16:35.020
put my attention elsewhere.

16:35.056 --> 16:36.588
No, no!

16:36.624 --> 16:37.856
Leave her out of this!

16:37.892 --> 16:38.857
Afraid I can't do that.

16:38.893 --> 16:42.327
She is an integral part of your penance.

16:42.363 --> 16:43.495
It was such a pleasant surprise

16:43.531 --> 16:44.663
when I discovered that the two of you

16:44.699 --> 16:46.565
were together.

16:46.600 --> 16:47.566
You know,

16:47.601 --> 16:49.768
after the initial gag reflex.

16:51.305 --> 16:52.738
You know,

16:52.773 --> 16:55.374
I bet this gal doesn't even exist.

16:55.409 --> 16:58.077
I mean, come on. Who would fall in love

16:58.112 --> 16:59.578
with a freak show like you?

16:59.613 --> 17:01.447
Oh, wait.

17:01.482 --> 17:03.015
Let me guess.

17:03.050 --> 17:05.483
I bet she's got a certificate, too, huh?

17:09.757 --> 17:10.955
What do you want?

17:12.926 --> 17:14.926
Tell me what you want.

17:16.396 --> 17:18.262
Tell me what you want.

17:19.300 --> 17:21.133
I want to break Butch's heart

17:21.167 --> 17:23.035
before I end his life.

17:23.069 --> 17:26.105
You know, kind of a
eye-for-an-eye thing.

17:26.140 --> 17:27.539
But in this case,

17:29.477 --> 17:31.443
I'll take a hand.

17:36.884 --> 17:39.218
Is that vinegar?

17:39.253 --> 17:41.453
Vinegar and baking soda.

17:41.489 --> 17:43.021
Takes tarnish off anything.

17:44.191 --> 17:46.358
Selina, that key is
hundreds of years old!

17:47.428 --> 17:48.961
I'm not an idiot, you know.

17:48.996 --> 17:51.130
Maybe there's something on the key

17:51.165 --> 17:52.564
that you can't see,

17:52.600 --> 17:55.134
because a hundred years
of crap is covering it up?

17:57.838 --> 18:00.339
Why did you tell Ivy
we weren't a couple?

18:00.374 --> 18:02.174
Why did you tell her we were?

18:02.209 --> 18:03.475
Is that a trick question?

18:04.512 --> 18:07.713
Why can't we just be us?

18:09.917 --> 18:12.484
Can you take that key out
now? It's making me nervous.

18:16.624 --> 18:18.457
Hmm.

18:18.492 --> 18:20.759
There's an engraving on it.

18:22.029 --> 18:24.897
Like a bird or something.

18:27.735 --> 18:29.835
Not just a bird.

18:29.870 --> 18:32.037
An owl.

18:33.073 --> 18:34.339
Uh, and?

18:34.375 --> 18:35.374
Alfred!

18:35.409 --> 18:37.409
If you're right,

18:37.444 --> 18:40.145
merely possessing this
key could be seen as

18:40.181 --> 18:41.547
breaking your agreement with
the people that the woman

18:41.582 --> 18:42.981
in the owl mask represents.

18:43.017 --> 18:44.216
Which is why we need to contact them.

18:44.251 --> 18:45.350
They have to understand

18:45.386 --> 18:47.119
Ivy didn't know what she was stealing.

18:47.154 --> 18:48.754
Wait, where is she anyhow?

18:53.327 --> 18:55.027
Oh, bloody hell. She's gone.

18:55.863 --> 18:56.962
How did she disable the alarm?

18:56.997 --> 18:59.498
Don't worry about that now, all right?

18:59.533 --> 19:00.566
What's the big deal? She'll be back

19:00.601 --> 19:01.567
when she's hungry.

19:07.473 --> 19:08.473
Wayne Manor.

19:08.509 --> 19:10.676
You have the necklace.

19:10.711 --> 19:12.477
We have your friend.

19:12.513 --> 19:14.413
We'll make exchange, no?

19:16.450 --> 19:18.717
Where and when?

19:48.295 --> 19:49.895
We're supposed to go down the manhole?

19:50.391 --> 19:52.891
That's what they said.

19:52.927 --> 19:54.159
All right, give me the key.

19:54.195 --> 19:55.594
I'll sort it out.

19:55.630 --> 19:58.097
No.

19:58.132 --> 19:59.898
I need to speak with them personally.

19:59.934 --> 20:01.800
Make sure they understand
this was a mistake.

20:02.837 --> 20:04.370
Very well, Master Bruce.

20:08.275 --> 20:09.942
There's no way of
asking you to stay here

20:09.977 --> 20:11.810
that doesn't end with you
yelling at me, is there?

20:11.846 --> 20:13.612
No.

20:24.925 --> 20:26.392
Over there.

20:26.427 --> 20:28.127
Ivy?

20:28.162 --> 20:29.495
It's about time!

20:37.838 --> 20:39.972
My name is Bruce Wayne.

20:40.007 --> 20:42.508
I need to speak with Kathryn.

20:43.978 --> 20:46.945
She needs to understand
I've honored our deal.

20:46.981 --> 20:49.214
Hand over the necklace and
you get your friend back.

20:49.250 --> 20:50.649
That's the deal.

20:50.685 --> 20:53.018
You mean the key, don't you?

20:54.488 --> 20:55.587
You're not getting it back

20:55.623 --> 20:57.456
until I talk to the people you work for.

20:57.491 --> 20:59.858
Maybe we just kill you and take it?

20:59.894 --> 21:01.393
You think we're stupid
enough to bring it with us?

21:05.733 --> 21:07.666
You really want it back?

21:07.702 --> 21:09.635
I'd listen to him.

21:09.670 --> 21:12.671
Put the tools down, lads, aye?

21:23.384 --> 21:24.717
I need reassurances

21:24.752 --> 21:26.552
my friends are no longer in any danger.

21:28.355 --> 21:30.155
I need to speak to
the woman in the mask.

21:30.191 --> 21:34.326
Any assurances that
woman gives you are lies.

21:34.361 --> 21:35.694
How do you know?

21:35.730 --> 21:36.795
Because the people

21:36.831 --> 21:38.831
you are talking about have no honor.

21:38.866 --> 21:40.899
And they will betray you

21:40.935 --> 21:42.868
as they betrayed us.

21:42.903 --> 21:44.136
Wait. You...

21:44.171 --> 21:45.504
you don't work for them?

21:45.539 --> 21:48.040
No, we work to destroy them.

21:50.344 --> 21:52.177
Who are they?

21:52.213 --> 21:54.413
They call themselves

21:54.448 --> 21:56.949
the Court of Owls.

22:01.822 --> 22:03.689
They're after Mario?

22:03.724 --> 22:05.224
Yes.

22:05.259 --> 22:07.192
Where is he?

22:07.228 --> 22:09.328
GCPD. He's safe for now.

22:09.363 --> 22:10.829
But I can't help him

22:10.865 --> 22:12.831
if you don't tell me what's going on.

22:12.867 --> 22:15.334
You think I'm holding something back?

22:15.369 --> 22:17.636
A military grade explosion.

22:17.671 --> 22:18.837
The clean up.

22:18.873 --> 22:22.007
A sword-wielding assassin
in broad daylight.

22:22.042 --> 22:23.909
This doesn't feel like a mob grudge.

22:23.944 --> 22:26.111
What else is there?

22:26.147 --> 22:29.581
Could Mario be mixed up in something?

22:29.617 --> 22:32.584
Is that what you came to ask me?

22:32.620 --> 22:34.253
I'm working the evidence I have.

22:34.288 --> 22:36.555
I understand why you'd want to believe

22:36.590 --> 22:39.858
the man who's marrying Lee
must be mixed up in something.

22:39.894 --> 22:41.860
But my son

22:41.896 --> 22:44.696
is the most decent
person I've ever known.

22:44.732 --> 22:46.932
He's not like us.

22:48.669 --> 22:52.304
That just tells me there's
something you don't know.

22:53.741 --> 22:56.141
Jim, Mario's gone.

22:56.177 --> 22:58.143
You were supposed to keep him there.

22:58.179 --> 23:00.712
I know, I tried, but he said
he didn't trust you or the GCPD

23:00.748 --> 23:03.248
to take care of this,
so he was going to.

23:03.284 --> 23:04.516
Whatever the hell that means.

23:05.820 --> 23:07.052
What is it?

23:07.087 --> 23:08.821
Mario just walked out of the GCPD.

23:08.856 --> 23:12.357
I think he's gonna try
to finish this himself.

23:12.393 --> 23:13.525
How?

23:13.561 --> 23:15.227
I have a pretty good idea.

23:20.901 --> 23:22.301
Can I help you?

23:22.336 --> 23:23.569
I hope so.

23:23.604 --> 23:26.538
I had something that was
supposed to be delivered to me.

23:26.574 --> 23:28.040
Could you check your records?

23:28.075 --> 23:29.741
Sure. Let me check the safe.

23:29.777 --> 23:31.009
Uh, what was the last name?

23:31.045 --> 23:32.377
- Nygma.
- Oh!

23:32.413 --> 23:34.980
That item was already delivered.

23:35.015 --> 23:36.682
Great.

23:36.717 --> 23:39.585
Well, I guess as long
as I'm already here,

23:39.620 --> 23:42.054
I should pick up
something for the weekend.

23:42.089 --> 23:43.388
Right?

23:44.425 --> 23:46.992
Hmm.

23:47.027 --> 23:49.061
Well, this looks fun.

23:49.096 --> 23:50.562
Could I ask a favor

23:50.598 --> 23:51.897
- of you...?
- Uh,

23:51.932 --> 23:53.565
- Todd.
- Todd.

23:53.601 --> 23:55.734
Could you show me how this works?

23:57.271 --> 23:59.605
We're not really supposed to...

23:59.640 --> 24:02.241
I won't tell if you don't.

24:03.277 --> 24:05.344
It's pretty basic, really.

24:05.379 --> 24:06.411
Um, you just...

24:06.447 --> 24:09.081
put your arms through here,

24:09.116 --> 24:11.316
and then your head through here.

24:11.352 --> 24:12.784
And you bring it up...

24:12.820 --> 24:13.952
And then... oh! Hey!

24:13.988 --> 24:16.455
Do you like role-play, Todd?

24:18.058 --> 24:19.091
Good.

24:19.126 --> 24:21.526
I will play the beautiful,

24:21.562 --> 24:23.295
coquettish bank robber

24:23.330 --> 24:26.465
who needs to get into
that safe, and you...

24:26.500 --> 24:28.467
get to play

24:28.502 --> 24:31.203
the lucky young shopkeeper
who gives her the combination.

24:31.238 --> 24:33.138
Okay?

24:33.173 --> 24:36.241
My friend was taken by this man, Nygma.

24:36.277 --> 24:39.311
I need to know where she is.

24:39.346 --> 24:40.746
If I find her,

24:40.781 --> 24:41.947
I could come back here

24:41.982 --> 24:43.949
and personally thank you.

24:45.686 --> 24:48.153
Give Mommy...

24:48.188 --> 24:50.255
the combination.

24:52.593 --> 24:55.961
Uh, nine to 25, 72.

24:55.996 --> 24:57.663
Good.

25:07.775 --> 25:11.343
Nygma, you sick bastard.

25:11.378 --> 25:12.778
Hey!

25:12.813 --> 25:15.147
Y-You can't just leave me here!

25:15.182 --> 25:16.748
H-H-Hello?

25:24.959 --> 25:27.626
Oh, goodie.

25:27.661 --> 25:29.328
You're finally awake.

25:29.363 --> 25:31.129
The show continues.

25:33.634 --> 25:35.634
Ta-da!

25:36.937 --> 25:38.937
I designed it myself.

25:38.973 --> 25:40.672
You want to see how it works?

25:40.708 --> 25:42.274
Okay!

25:42.309 --> 25:44.042
I love a captive audience.

25:44.078 --> 25:46.678
So, we'll set the timer for, say...

25:46.714 --> 25:48.981
55 seconds.

25:49.016 --> 25:50.315
Now, when the timer hits zero,

25:50.351 --> 25:53.285
the spring-loaded blade is released.

25:53.320 --> 25:54.653
Simple.

25:54.688 --> 25:56.088
Now.

25:56.123 --> 25:57.656
For the fun part.

25:57.691 --> 25:59.291
You can stop the blade
from being released

25:59.326 --> 26:00.959
if you click this...

26:00.995 --> 26:02.894
little button. But if you do,

26:02.930 --> 26:05.564
it will send a fatal jolt

26:05.599 --> 26:08.400
of electricity to zap Butch.

26:08.435 --> 26:10.969
It's a simple test, really.

26:11.005 --> 26:14.072
Stop the blade from falling

26:14.108 --> 26:16.541
and kill Butch, or...

26:22.449 --> 26:24.549
Mm.

26:24.585 --> 26:26.852
The choice...

26:29.590 --> 26:31.156
my dear,

26:31.191 --> 26:32.758
is yours.

26:32.793 --> 26:35.894
Will we hear the zap of heartbreak?

26:37.064 --> 26:40.565
Or the sound of one hand clapping?

26:48.453 --> 26:50.152
My name is Volk.

26:51.389 --> 26:53.789
My brother, Jacob, and that's Dmitry.

26:55.226 --> 26:57.360
What's with the stupid mask?

26:58.563 --> 26:59.996
I like you.

27:00.031 --> 27:02.498
You remind me of my sister in Kiev.

27:02.533 --> 27:05.167
Dmitry is an initiate.

27:05.203 --> 27:06.502
The mask ensures his silence

27:06.537 --> 27:08.638
until he proves himself

27:08.673 --> 27:11.274
- and becomes a full member.
- Of what?

27:11.309 --> 27:12.441
Who are you?

27:12.477 --> 27:14.810
We are called the Whisper Gang.

27:14.846 --> 27:17.680
Gotham's most notorious smugglers.

27:17.715 --> 27:20.583
We used to number in the
hundreds until the Court saw

27:20.618 --> 27:23.853
our growing strength, and
they offered us a partnership,

27:23.888 --> 27:26.689
only to betray us.

27:26.724 --> 27:29.292
Many escaped back to Ukraine
but a few of us stayed back,

27:29.327 --> 27:30.793
hoping to find a way

27:30.828 --> 27:33.429
to enact revenge.

27:33.464 --> 27:34.997
And we did.

27:35.033 --> 27:36.132
The key.

27:37.268 --> 27:39.135
Well, what does it open?

27:39.170 --> 27:41.304
A safe.

27:42.941 --> 27:45.341
Is is in one of the Court's buildings...

27:46.511 --> 27:48.044
here.

27:48.079 --> 27:49.578
Inside, there is a...

27:49.614 --> 27:51.480
a device, that we believe

27:51.516 --> 27:53.382
can destroy them.

27:53.418 --> 27:55.751
What, like, some kind of... weapon?

27:55.787 --> 27:58.487
Well, honestly, we don't know.

27:58.523 --> 28:00.089
We captured a member,
but even he didn't know

28:00.124 --> 28:02.825
what's inside the safe, only that

28:02.860 --> 28:05.094
the Court fears it falling

28:05.129 --> 28:06.996
- into the hands of their enemies.
- Wait,

28:07.031 --> 28:08.698
Wouldn't they know you stole it?

28:08.733 --> 28:10.132
They're probably waiting for you

28:10.168 --> 28:11.734
- to show up there.
- No.

28:11.769 --> 28:14.103
Because originally,
the safe had two keys.

28:14.138 --> 28:15.838
The Court still has one of them,

28:15.873 --> 28:18.040
and the second was thought lost.

28:18.076 --> 28:20.042
Until I found it.

28:20.078 --> 28:23.079
You mean we did.

28:24.148 --> 28:27.249
The Court of Owls killed my parents.

28:27.285 --> 28:30.353
I stood down because I thought
there was no way to defeat them.

28:30.388 --> 28:33.122
What are you proposing?

28:33.157 --> 28:34.890
If what you're saying is true,

28:34.926 --> 28:37.927
and there is something in that safe,

28:37.962 --> 28:41.330
then that's no longer the case.

28:51.909 --> 28:53.142
Mario?

28:54.979 --> 28:57.913
You really think this is a good idea?

28:57.949 --> 28:59.582
Using yourself as bait?

28:59.617 --> 29:01.617
If those guys are out
there, Lee isn't safe.

29:01.652 --> 29:03.652
They're pros. You're gonna get killed.

29:03.688 --> 29:05.054
What do you care?

29:05.089 --> 29:06.422
Why would someone want to kill you?

29:06.457 --> 29:07.456
I have no idea.

29:07.492 --> 29:08.624
Because it seems to me,

29:08.659 --> 29:11.494
an operation like this
doesn't happen for no reason,

29:11.529 --> 29:13.829
and putting yourself in the
crosshairs feels a lot like

29:13.865 --> 29:15.331
someone protecting a secret.

29:15.366 --> 29:17.666
I want to protect Lee.

29:17.702 --> 29:19.335
That's it.

29:22.006 --> 29:23.773
We're sitting ducks in here.

29:23.808 --> 29:25.408
We need to get away from bystanders.

29:27.145 --> 29:28.744
- They're here.
- What?

29:28.780 --> 29:30.112
Get down!

29:35.119 --> 29:36.952
No, no!

29:38.356 --> 29:40.022
No! No, please!

29:53.071 --> 29:54.303
You could've killed her.

29:54.338 --> 29:55.938
Who sent you?

29:55.973 --> 29:58.474
Why are you coming after me?!

29:58.509 --> 30:01.077
You... know...

30:01.112 --> 30:02.611
why.

30:19.330 --> 30:20.496
Ed, come on.

30:20.531 --> 30:23.032
Come on, let's talk about this, huh?

30:23.067 --> 30:24.400
Come on, Ed.

30:24.435 --> 30:25.501
You don't have to do this.

30:25.536 --> 30:26.569
Come on, let's talk about this.

30:26.604 --> 30:28.637
Come on! Listen!

30:28.673 --> 30:31.640
I told you, I've never heard
of anyone named Isabelle!

30:31.676 --> 30:33.275
Isabella!

30:33.311 --> 30:35.311
Why is that so difficult?

30:35.346 --> 30:37.813
Also, I'm not the one you
should be pleading with.

30:37.849 --> 30:39.882
Your life is in her...

30:39.917 --> 30:41.350
hand.

30:42.386 --> 30:45.087
What difference does it make?

30:45.123 --> 30:46.889
You're gonna kill me one
way or the other, right?

30:48.459 --> 30:50.860
Good point.

30:50.895 --> 30:53.662
New deal.

30:53.698 --> 30:55.498
If she loves you enough
to sacrifice her hand...

30:55.533 --> 30:56.999
Twinsies...

30:57.034 --> 30:58.701
In exchange for your life.

30:58.736 --> 31:00.503
I swear on the memory

31:00.538 --> 31:02.238
of my beloved Isabella,

31:02.273 --> 31:04.673
I will set you both free.

31:12.950 --> 31:14.250
Tabby.

31:14.285 --> 31:16.051
Baby, come on.

31:20.057 --> 31:21.857
We can... get out of here, we can...

31:21.893 --> 31:23.959
I like you, Butch. I really do.

31:23.995 --> 31:26.095
But to be completely honest,

31:26.130 --> 31:28.731
I'm not exactly in a
"love" place right now.

31:32.069 --> 31:34.203
Sorry, big fella.

31:34.238 --> 31:36.338
I wish I could say that I was surprised,

31:36.374 --> 31:39.074
but I knew that she
was going to say that.

31:39.110 --> 31:40.809
It's why I made the offer.

31:40.845 --> 31:42.711
Any final words?

31:42.747 --> 31:44.146
I would keep it brief.

31:47.185 --> 31:48.784
Tabby.

31:48.819 --> 31:50.886
Baby.

31:50.922 --> 31:53.923
The last few weeks have
been the best of my life.

31:55.259 --> 31:58.127
And it's okay you don't love me.

31:58.162 --> 32:02.231
'Cause I love you.

32:02.266 --> 32:06.001
And for a guy like me?
That's... that's enough.

32:06.037 --> 32:07.803
And you.

32:07.838 --> 32:09.438
You're damn right I killed her.

32:09.473 --> 32:12.141
I killed the woman you loved,

32:12.176 --> 32:13.943
You know what she said to me?

32:13.978 --> 32:15.978
Right before I put a
bullet in her brain?

32:16.013 --> 32:18.948
You know what she told
me? She said she wished

32:18.983 --> 32:20.516
she would have been with a real man.

32:20.551 --> 32:22.051
Hey, Butch.

32:22.987 --> 32:24.753
Yeah?

32:24.789 --> 32:27.423
You're sweet.

32:30.861 --> 32:32.528
No!

32:32.563 --> 32:34.330
No!

32:43.093 --> 32:44.426
Untie me!

32:44.461 --> 32:46.762
Please, untie me! She's
got to get to a hospital!

32:46.797 --> 32:48.230
Quick! Unh!

32:48.265 --> 32:50.665
You said that you put
a bullet in her head.

32:50.701 --> 32:52.868
Isabella died in a car crash.

32:52.903 --> 32:54.302
The brake lines were cut.

32:54.338 --> 32:56.671
I don't care! I told you
I never heard of her!

32:56.707 --> 32:59.241
You... you really didn't kill her?

32:59.276 --> 33:00.609
No! Untie me!

33:00.644 --> 33:02.744
She's got to get to a hospital, come on!

33:08.752 --> 33:10.986
I'd put that hand on some ice.

33:20.130 --> 33:22.664
Neither of you recognize him?

33:22.699 --> 33:23.965
No.

33:25.235 --> 33:26.635
Has he said anything?

33:26.670 --> 33:28.503
Not a peep.

33:28.539 --> 33:31.473
Hey, I ran your guy's prints.

33:31.508 --> 33:33.441
They're not in the system,
which, considering he's a pro,

33:33.477 --> 33:34.810
wasn't that hard to believe.

33:34.845 --> 33:37.078
Yeah, still, now that we have him,

33:37.114 --> 33:39.414
we should work him, find
out who's behind this.

33:39.449 --> 33:40.916
You better act quick. Call came in.

33:40.951 --> 33:43.552
They're transferring him to
a federal facility upstate.

33:43.587 --> 33:45.987
What? No, no, no, no. We
can't let this guy leave.

33:46.023 --> 33:47.756
What can I do? My hands are tied.

33:47.791 --> 33:49.624
The Feds want him, they get him.

33:49.660 --> 33:50.992
The question is why?

33:51.028 --> 33:53.995
Maybe somebody wants him
out of this precinct.

33:54.031 --> 33:56.398
Away from us.

33:56.433 --> 33:58.333
I don't know anyone
with that kind of pull.

33:58.368 --> 34:00.202
Do you?

34:04.975 --> 34:06.508
The other assassin.

34:06.543 --> 34:09.210
You want to tell me what
happened in the store?

34:09.246 --> 34:10.879
There's nothing to tell.

34:10.914 --> 34:13.915
He came after me, I did
what I needed to do.

34:17.688 --> 34:19.221
You called her?

34:21.024 --> 34:23.225
She deserves to know what's going on.

34:23.260 --> 34:24.793
Either you tell her or I will.

34:32.603 --> 34:34.135
Come on.

34:46.116 --> 34:49.083
I think I know who sent you.

34:49.119 --> 34:52.420
But I need to know for sure.

34:52.456 --> 34:55.623
And we both know that
you're not going to tell me.

34:57.027 --> 34:58.526
So...

35:04.868 --> 35:07.068
So, how does it feel?

35:07.104 --> 35:10.171
I don't know, maybe I could be captain.

35:10.207 --> 35:12.507
Yell at people for not having proof,

35:12.542 --> 35:14.242
or, uh, at one of my detectives

35:14.278 --> 35:15.243
for going after a pair of assassins

35:15.279 --> 35:17.612
all by his lonesome.

35:17.648 --> 35:18.880
Not bad.

35:18.916 --> 35:21.116
Right? Very interesting play,

35:21.151 --> 35:22.317
by the way.

35:22.352 --> 35:23.318
It's not every day that you get

35:23.353 --> 35:25.987
to save the man who's
marrying the woman you love.

35:26.023 --> 35:29.357
Yeah, I'm really something.

35:29.393 --> 35:31.559
It's not too late, Jim.

35:32.863 --> 35:35.263
Lee deserves to know how you feel.

35:35.299 --> 35:39.467
God knows I know that life
gives us enough regret.

35:39.503 --> 35:41.069
There's no need adding to it.

35:43.307 --> 35:45.440
- Oh, crap.
- I know it's hard.

35:45.475 --> 35:46.840
It's just, it's something you have to...

35:46.879 --> 35:48.451
Falcone.

35:59.690 --> 36:01.890
Falcone, up against the wall!

36:01.925 --> 36:03.091
What are you doing?

36:03.126 --> 36:05.393
Just having a chat.

36:05.429 --> 36:07.028
Turns out our friend here works

36:07.064 --> 36:09.230
for a former associate of mine.

36:09.266 --> 36:11.533
So now that I know who's behind this,

36:11.568 --> 36:14.069
I can take care of it... my way.

36:14.104 --> 36:15.070
It's over.

36:15.105 --> 36:16.237
You think you're gonna walk away?

36:16.273 --> 36:18.573
You just assaulted a
suspect in police custody.

36:20.110 --> 36:22.877
He won't be pressing charges.

36:22.913 --> 36:24.913
I'm gonna find out what happened today.

36:24.948 --> 36:27.449
Who's pulling the strings,
and how Mario's involved.

36:27.484 --> 36:28.650
Trust me.

36:28.685 --> 36:31.987
If I were you, I'd let it go.

36:40.130 --> 36:42.831
Gather the men. Tell them
we are joining forces

36:42.866 --> 36:43.965
with the boy.

36:44.001 --> 36:45.433
I will brief them tomorrow night myself.

36:45.469 --> 36:46.768
Volk!

36:46.803 --> 36:49.471
Dmitry, eyes.

37:07.758 --> 37:09.858
We know you've been
searching for the second key.

37:11.695 --> 37:13.094
Have you found it?

37:24.007 --> 37:25.740
I'll ask you again.

37:25.776 --> 37:29.244
Have you found the second key?

37:29.279 --> 37:32.247
Why don't you ask Dmitry, huh?

37:51.189 --> 37:53.222
Think she'll be okay?

37:53.258 --> 37:54.457
Think they can re-attach the hand?

37:54.492 --> 37:55.758
Please, she's tough as nails.

37:55.793 --> 37:56.726
She'll be fine.

37:56.761 --> 37:58.427
You know this is war, right?

37:58.463 --> 37:59.795
Nygma, Penguin, anyone
who stands with them...

37:59.831 --> 38:01.063
They're all dead.

38:01.099 --> 38:02.732
This woman Isabella...

38:02.767 --> 38:04.700
Nygma said she was a librarian, right?

38:04.736 --> 38:07.336
Well, who kills a librarian?
I mean, what's the motive?

38:07.372 --> 38:08.938
I don't know. Maybe someone had

38:08.973 --> 38:11.210
an overdue book, and
things got out of hand.

38:12.143 --> 38:14.710
Excuse me, but you just can't wa...

38:14.746 --> 38:16.946
Come on! Come on!

38:16.981 --> 38:19.115
We got a hand here, people. Hand!

38:19.150 --> 38:20.883
You cut someone's brake lines.

38:20.918 --> 38:23.085
You know where they're going and when.

38:23.121 --> 38:25.421
You'd know...

38:25.456 --> 38:27.623
You know them.

38:27.659 --> 38:29.625
I know who did it.

38:29.661 --> 38:32.228
I know who killed the librarian.

38:32.263 --> 38:33.896
Who?

38:33.931 --> 38:35.331
The same person who's in love with Nygma

38:35.366 --> 38:37.867
- and doesn't want to share him.
- Okay.

38:37.902 --> 38:39.602
One woman in love with
that psychotic bean pole

38:39.637 --> 38:41.070
defies explanation, but two?

38:41.105 --> 38:44.006
Who said anything about a woman?

38:44.042 --> 38:47.610
I am tired of sitting
at the kids' table.

38:47.645 --> 38:51.414
If I'm right, we can have
way more than vengeance.

38:51.449 --> 38:53.716
We can have it all.

38:53.751 --> 38:56.352
We don't need to go to war.

38:56.387 --> 38:59.288
All we need to do is start one.

39:07.598 --> 39:10.232
There must have been some mistake.

39:10.268 --> 39:12.568
We don't make mistakes.

39:12.603 --> 39:15.104
I've always done whatever
the Court has asked of me.

39:15.139 --> 39:17.506
Even against my own interest.

39:17.542 --> 39:20.676
I got you Indian Hill when
Maroni refused to sell.

39:20.712 --> 39:23.346
No one is questioning your loyalty.

39:23.381 --> 39:24.547
If this isn't about me,

39:24.582 --> 39:26.849
Then why are you trying to kill my son?

39:26.884 --> 39:29.752
There are things you're not privy to.

39:29.787 --> 39:31.687
That's not an answer.

39:31.723 --> 39:34.924
It will have to do.

39:35.926 --> 39:36.926
We both know the level

39:36.961 --> 39:39.061
of destruction I can cause.

39:39.097 --> 39:41.697
You think we're scared of you?

39:41.733 --> 39:42.765
The car bomb was designed

39:42.800 --> 39:44.934
to look like a mob hit.

39:44.969 --> 39:46.936
You didn't want me to
find out it was you.

39:46.971 --> 39:48.204
I have.

39:48.239 --> 39:51.107
I don't care about your reasons.

39:51.142 --> 39:52.308
If my son is harmed in any way,

39:52.343 --> 39:55.378
I will come after you
with everything I have.

39:55.413 --> 39:57.380
You won't win.

39:57.415 --> 39:59.982
If my son is dead,

40:00.017 --> 40:01.684
winning won't be the point.

40:03.321 --> 40:06.055
Gotham will burn.

40:06.090 --> 40:09.892
This city is on the brink of chaos.

40:09.927 --> 40:13.229
Only we can save it.

40:13.264 --> 40:16.132
We will expect your
assistance when called on.

40:16.167 --> 40:18.834
Until then, your son is safe.

40:18.870 --> 40:21.437
At least from us.

40:21.472 --> 40:24.407
What aren't you telling me?

40:24.442 --> 40:27.810
A great many things.

40:29.480 --> 40:31.981
Enjoy your dinner.

41:01.279 --> 41:02.711
Hey.

41:08.820 --> 41:11.120
Is everything okay?

41:11.155 --> 41:14.657
I was on my way to the rehearsal dinner.

41:14.692 --> 41:17.493
Then I heard myself telling
the cab driver your address.

41:17.528 --> 41:19.695
Mario told me everything.

41:19.730 --> 41:21.163
About today.

41:21.199 --> 41:23.666
How you risked your own
life to make sure...

41:23.701 --> 41:25.968
I didn't do it for him.

41:26.003 --> 41:29.338
I know.

41:29.373 --> 41:31.140
He's a good man.

41:31.175 --> 41:32.641
Uh-huh.

41:35.746 --> 41:37.546
Tell me.

41:37.582 --> 41:39.482
What?

41:39.517 --> 41:41.817
What you have to tell me.

41:45.823 --> 41:49.692
I missed my chance to give
you the life you deserve.

41:49.727 --> 41:51.894
To make you happy.

41:53.531 --> 41:57.266
But I do want that for you.

41:57.301 --> 41:59.235
More than anything.

42:02.773 --> 42:05.007
Why does it feel like
we keep saying good-bye?

42:08.045 --> 42:10.913
Maybe it's all we have left.

42:10.948 --> 42:14.083
Or we just haven't done it properly yet.

42:22.793 --> 42:24.927
Good-bye, James Gordon.

42:43.915 --> 42:45.014
Yo, Peeping Tom

42:46.517 --> 42:48.584
You lost?

42:48.619 --> 42:51.153
Lucky for you, we sell directions.

42:53.057 --> 42:56.725
The price... everything you've got.

42:56.761 --> 42:58.727
She loves him. She loves him.

42:58.763 --> 43:00.362
- She loves him...
- You deaf?

43:00.398 --> 43:02.464
She loves him, she loves him!

43:02.500 --> 43:04.166
I said...

43:04.201 --> 43:05.968
Hey, man...

43:07.605 --> 43:11.206
She... loves... me!

43:11.242 --> 43:13.008
And I won't let her go.

43:13.811 --> 43:14.843
She...

43:14.879 --> 43:18.781
loves... me!
