00:01.210 --> 00:03.785
- Previously on American Gothic...
- You think if you come clean,

00:03.787 --> 00:04.819
you get the girl back.

00:04.821 --> 00:06.186
Last chance.

00:07.239 --> 00:08.322
Bye.

00:08.324 --> 00:10.358
Jennifer Windham strikes again.

00:10.360 --> 00:12.602
Where is this woman
getting all these stories?

00:12.760 --> 00:13.826
I'm so sorry.

00:13.975 --> 00:15.500
For sleeping with my husband?

00:15.623 --> 00:16.897
Or for illegally bugging us?

00:16.898 --> 00:17.922
I'm pregnant.

00:17.924 --> 00:19.691
That's the killer
getting back in the car.

00:19.693 --> 00:21.125
That's the passenger door.

00:21.127 --> 00:22.593
Someone else is driving.

00:22.595 --> 00:24.896
Jack, tell me right
now. Where did you get this?

00:24.898 --> 00:26.764
Uncle Garrett's cabin.

00:26.766 --> 00:27.999
I want to toast

00:28.001 --> 00:29.434
my big brother.

00:29.436 --> 00:31.602
To family.

00:36.442 --> 00:38.910
You know what they say.

00:38.912 --> 00:41.779
When you arrest an innocent person,

00:41.781 --> 00:43.314
they freak out.

00:43.316 --> 00:46.884
They're yelling, pacing,
and never sit still.

00:48.420 --> 00:52.290
But when you arrest
someone who's guilty,

00:52.292 --> 00:54.325
they go to sleep.

00:56.261 --> 00:58.329
You've heard that, haven't you?

00:58.331 --> 01:01.432
Funny thing...

01:01.434 --> 01:05.369
is that when we brought you in

01:05.370 --> 01:07.004
and we put you in that cell,

01:07.006 --> 01:10.742
you lay awake all night.

01:10.744 --> 01:13.144
Perfectly still.

01:13.146 --> 01:15.146
But you never slept.

01:15.148 --> 01:18.449
I don't believe you did
any of the actual killing.

01:18.451 --> 01:20.318
I think it was all your dad.

01:20.320 --> 01:21.753
Garrett, look.

01:21.755 --> 01:23.588
If you're willing to come clean,

01:23.590 --> 01:25.490
tell the entire truth

01:25.492 --> 01:27.825
about your role in
the Silver Bells killings,

01:27.827 --> 01:31.295
that would be an incredible
showing of good faith.

01:31.297 --> 01:34.198
But if you don't cooperate, Garrett,

01:34.200 --> 01:35.967
we have the knife.

01:35.969 --> 01:37.301
Your knife.

01:37.303 --> 01:39.604
The bit of ivory
that was found at the site

01:39.606 --> 01:41.672
of the first Silver Bells killing

01:41.674 --> 01:45.076
matches exactly the piece
missing from the knife.

01:45.078 --> 01:47.645
Your knife.

01:47.647 --> 01:51.082
We know, absolutely,

01:51.084 --> 01:53.518
that you're involved.

01:53.520 --> 01:55.353
Just answer the question.

01:55.355 --> 01:56.921
Garrett.

01:57.890 --> 02:00.191
What did you do?

02:02.000 --> 02:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:14.773 --> 02:16.941
How you feeling?

02:16.943 --> 02:18.543
Fine.

02:18.545 --> 02:22.246
No problems with the guards
or other... people?

02:22.248 --> 02:24.315
The other prisoners?

02:25.217 --> 02:27.118
No. No problem.

02:27.120 --> 02:29.287
Have the police questioned you?

02:29.289 --> 02:32.256
Yeah, a little.

02:32.258 --> 02:33.424
And you didn't say anything?

02:33.426 --> 02:34.959
No, not yet.

02:34.961 --> 02:36.994
Not ever.

02:37.796 --> 02:39.197
Now,

02:39.199 --> 02:42.767
I've put a call in to Darcy Campano.

02:42.769 --> 02:44.735
She's brilliant. I've hired her

02:44.737 --> 02:46.504
- to defend you.
- Save your money.

02:46.506 --> 02:48.072
Save it.

02:48.074 --> 02:50.274
You love your money.

02:50.276 --> 02:54.078
She's the best criminal defense
attorney in the city,

02:54.080 --> 02:55.046
worth every p...

02:55.048 --> 02:58.149
Stop!

02:59.618 --> 03:01.752
Stop.

03:01.754 --> 03:03.454
It's over.

03:03.456 --> 03:07.325
All of this was inevitable.

03:07.327 --> 03:10.161
We just postponed it 14 years.

03:10.163 --> 03:11.762
That's all.

03:14.233 --> 03:15.833
It was nice, though.

03:17.870 --> 03:19.337
It was.

03:21.473 --> 03:24.141
Being back in the fold.

03:27.512 --> 03:30.882
Part of... Part of the family again.

03:30.884 --> 03:32.583
That's not over.

03:32.585 --> 03:33.985
I think it is.

03:33.987 --> 03:36.821
No. Listen to me.

03:36.823 --> 03:39.690
I've been thinking about that knife,

03:39.692 --> 03:43.995
and I seem to remember that
your father gave it to you.

03:46.098 --> 03:48.499
Do you remember that?

03:50.969 --> 03:53.004
Do you?

03:53.006 --> 03:55.473
Yeah, I remember a lot of things.

03:58.510 --> 04:01.012
Some more vividly than others.

04:29.041 --> 04:31.909
You're the best guy in the world.

04:31.911 --> 04:33.844
That's the story I'll sell to everybody.

04:33.846 --> 04:35.746
Because the only real
evidence they've got

04:35.748 --> 04:37.148
is the knife from your cabin.

04:37.150 --> 04:38.683
And there is an ocean of time

04:38.685 --> 04:40.418
between when that ivory chip
fell out of the handle

04:40.420 --> 04:41.585
and when they got the knife.

04:41.587 --> 04:44.221
I will rip them to shreds over this.

04:44.223 --> 04:46.524
And I understand from your mother

04:46.526 --> 04:48.025
that it wasn't even your knife.

04:48.027 --> 04:49.560
Your dad gave it to you.

04:49.562 --> 04:50.895
He must have had it on
him during a murder,

04:50.897 --> 04:52.330
left the ivory chip behind,

04:52.332 --> 04:53.998
then gave it to his
nature-loving oldest son,

04:54.000 --> 04:55.366
and that was that.

04:55.368 --> 04:57.501
You're just an innocent bystander

04:57.503 --> 04:59.270
with an unlucky genealogy.

05:00.405 --> 05:01.872
Have you ever read

05:01.874 --> 05:03.941
the writings of Horace Mann?

05:04.810 --> 05:06.143
What?

05:07.045 --> 05:10.047
"If evil is inevitable,

05:10.049 --> 05:13.217
how are the wicked accountable?"

05:14.987 --> 05:17.455
"Why do we call men wicked at all?"

05:19.658 --> 05:21.959
"Evil is inevitable..."

05:24.930 --> 05:26.764
"...but it is also remediable."

05:26.766 --> 05:28.532
Also remediable.

05:28.534 --> 05:31.502
Do you believe that?

05:31.504 --> 05:34.271
Wh... I'm sure you're a
little freaked out in here.

05:34.273 --> 05:35.573
That's understandable.

05:35.575 --> 05:37.274
I mean, it's jail, for God's sakes.

05:37.276 --> 05:38.776
It's a shock to the system.

05:38.778 --> 05:41.045
No one ever expects to wind up here.

05:41.047 --> 05:43.781
Well, actually, I kind of did.

05:58.457 --> 06:01.766
I need you to just
sit tight and keep quiet.

06:01.768 --> 06:03.100
Don't tell anybody anything.

06:03.102 --> 06:04.302
Don't even tell me anything.

06:04.304 --> 06:05.636
Nothing.

06:05.638 --> 06:08.105
You think you can do that?

06:08.107 --> 06:09.240
Of course you can.

06:09.242 --> 06:11.209
Are you sleeping okay?

06:11.211 --> 06:13.244
Yeah.

06:14.646 --> 06:16.581
Yeah, I can sleep anywhere.

07:20.746 --> 07:24.115
You mind telling me why
you're breaking into my cabin?

07:24.117 --> 07:25.583
And just what are you hoping to steal?

07:25.585 --> 07:26.918
Nothing!

07:26.920 --> 07:29.053
I-I wasn't going to steal anything.

07:29.055 --> 07:31.155
I swear.

07:31.157 --> 07:34.392
I just, I just need
a warm place to stay.

07:37.396 --> 07:39.363
How long you been out here?

07:41.366 --> 07:43.000
A while.

07:43.002 --> 07:45.102
Just sleeping in the woods?

07:46.505 --> 07:48.773
No, I-I've been couch surfing.

07:48.775 --> 07:50.908
The hell does that mean?

07:50.910 --> 07:53.711
A lot of the cabins are
empty, so I've just been...

07:53.713 --> 07:56.180
Breaking in and sleeping
in people's cabins.

07:56.182 --> 07:59.016
- Yeah, that's right.
- And eating their food?

07:59.018 --> 08:00.918
Maybe a few times.

08:00.920 --> 08:04.588
Where you come from?

08:04.590 --> 08:06.257
Boston.

08:06.259 --> 08:08.359
You're telling me you came
out here from Boston

08:08.361 --> 08:10.761
with no cabin, no food, and no plan?

08:10.763 --> 08:13.798
I thought I could figure it out.

08:13.800 --> 08:15.199
I've been up here before.

08:15.201 --> 08:16.534
Okay, Daniel Boone.

08:16.536 --> 08:19.203
About eight miles that way

08:19.205 --> 08:21.672
is a road that gets you
back to the highway.

08:21.674 --> 08:25.276
You can thumb a ride back
to Boston. Now start walking.

08:25.278 --> 08:27.578
- No, I'm not going back.
- I ain't asking you, son,

08:27.580 --> 08:29.146
I'm telling you get
the hell out of here.

08:29.148 --> 08:30.481
I'm not going back there!

08:30.483 --> 08:31.882
How come?

08:31.884 --> 08:33.083
I...

08:33.086 --> 08:34.986
couldn't take the people.

08:34.988 --> 08:37.888
Well, that makes two of us.

08:39.224 --> 08:40.524
I don't care where you go.

08:40.525 --> 08:42.025
But you got to go.

08:42.028 --> 08:44.260
And if I catch you
back around my place again...

08:44.263 --> 08:45.329
I know...

08:45.331 --> 08:47.932
you won't miss next time.

08:47.934 --> 08:51.168
I didn't miss this time.

08:56.074 --> 08:58.309
Daniel Boone.

08:58.311 --> 09:00.811
Where's your canteen?

09:04.783 --> 09:07.451
So you won't die of thirst.

09:08.954 --> 09:10.121
There's a call for you.

09:10.123 --> 09:11.989
Come on, you can take it out here.

09:14.226 --> 09:15.259
Hello.

09:15.261 --> 09:16.260
How's jail?

09:16.262 --> 09:17.561
They treating you all right?

09:17.563 --> 09:19.497
Yeah, it's fine.

09:20.399 --> 09:21.832
How's rehab?

09:21.834 --> 09:24.135
It's great. You know,
there's some group time,

09:24.137 --> 09:26.537
some alone time...

09:26.539 --> 09:28.906
it's cool.

09:28.908 --> 09:30.141
Visitors?

09:30.143 --> 09:31.776
Yeah, you know, the fam.

09:31.778 --> 09:33.744
Hey, too bad jail isn't closer to rehab,

09:33.746 --> 09:35.646
they'd only have to park once.

09:37.617 --> 09:40.584
Cam, I want to apologize to you.

09:40.586 --> 09:41.585
What?

09:41.587 --> 09:43.287
You were doing me a favor,

09:43.289 --> 09:47.491
going to talk to
Christina, when you got the drugs...

09:47.493 --> 09:49.060
Hey, look.

09:49.062 --> 09:52.163
I mean, you must be feeling
a lot of guilt over...

09:52.165 --> 09:54.732
I-I don't know and I
don't want to know,

09:54.734 --> 09:58.569
but as far as me using's concerned,

09:58.571 --> 10:00.738
you can let yourself
off the hook for that.

10:00.740 --> 10:03.707
- I mean, I earned my place in here
all by myself. - Yeah, I know.

10:03.709 --> 10:05.609
That goes back a long time.

10:05.611 --> 10:07.711
I wish I'd been there for more of that.

10:10.750 --> 10:12.249
I'm sorry for that, as well.

10:12.251 --> 10:13.651
Hey, man, look. I'm the one's

10:13.653 --> 10:15.386
supposed to be making the amends here.

10:15.388 --> 10:17.221
Listen...

10:18.723 --> 10:20.858
I want you to know something.

10:23.695 --> 10:25.162
I'm proud of you.

10:26.098 --> 10:28.165
I'm in rehab for the fifth time.

10:28.167 --> 10:29.567
No, no.

10:29.569 --> 10:31.569
Not the drugs. Not that. But...

10:31.571 --> 10:34.271
you stayed true to yourself.

10:34.273 --> 10:36.774
I mean, you could have been a...

10:36.776 --> 10:39.076
A spoiled, preppy little jackass.

10:39.078 --> 10:40.978
But-but you're not. You're an artist.

10:40.980 --> 10:44.915
You made a-a career out of being smart

10:44.917 --> 10:46.550
and subversive. And...

10:46.552 --> 10:48.285
I am so proud of you.

10:48.287 --> 10:51.689
Why are you being all
wise and philosophical?

10:51.691 --> 10:53.524
Oh, you know.

10:54.893 --> 10:56.193
Just getting it all out

10:56.195 --> 10:58.095
before I go to the electric chair.

10:59.665 --> 11:02.032
I've been thinking about
a lot of different things.

11:02.034 --> 11:03.834
Honesty.

11:03.836 --> 11:05.336
Transparency.

11:05.338 --> 11:09.206
Somehow, it's-it's liberating.

11:09.208 --> 11:12.309
Maybe I'm finding a whole
new way of living again.

11:33.165 --> 11:35.065
Is this what you were after?

11:40.405 --> 11:41.705
This is good.

11:41.707 --> 11:43.107
Mm-hmm.

11:43.109 --> 11:45.576
So, uh,

11:45.578 --> 11:47.044
you're not still mad at me

11:47.046 --> 11:49.680
for trying to break into your place?

11:49.682 --> 11:52.983
Well, you didn't actually break in.

11:52.985 --> 11:55.052
And the fact that you've
been out here for a year,

11:55.054 --> 11:56.787
all alone...

11:56.789 --> 11:58.189
I get it.

11:58.191 --> 11:59.957
Most people probably wouldn't.

11:59.959 --> 12:02.359
But I do.

12:03.662 --> 12:05.262
Do you, uh,

12:05.264 --> 12:06.630
live out here all the time?

12:06.632 --> 12:08.098
No.

12:08.100 --> 12:10.634
I only come out for about a month.

12:10.636 --> 12:12.069
Always around this time.

12:12.071 --> 12:15.806
So I may see you once a year.

12:15.808 --> 12:17.441
If that feels too often,

12:17.443 --> 12:20.110
we can cut it back to every other year.

12:22.181 --> 12:24.815
I can show you how to catch
a rabbit, if you want.

12:24.817 --> 12:26.083
Yeah, thanks.

12:26.085 --> 12:27.284
I'd-I'd really appreciate that.

12:27.286 --> 12:29.053
Ah, don't be gooey about it.

12:29.055 --> 12:30.487
It ain't no big deal.

12:33.024 --> 12:34.491
Okay.

12:39.264 --> 12:41.832
Ollie Westcott died.

12:41.834 --> 12:43.367
I'm sorry.

12:43.369 --> 12:44.802
Was he a friend of yours?

12:44.804 --> 12:46.303
No. That old bastard

12:46.305 --> 12:47.838
didn't have any friends.

12:49.774 --> 12:52.476
But he also didn't have any relatives.

12:52.478 --> 12:55.679
There won't be no one coming
up here to claim his cabin.

12:55.681 --> 12:59.049
I'll show you where it is tomorrow.

12:59.051 --> 13:00.718
Hmm?

13:49.334 --> 13:51.702
All right.

14:17.729 --> 14:20.364
Well, what do you know?

14:20.366 --> 14:22.566
You're getting better
at catching 'em than me.

14:23.735 --> 14:25.469
I still want you to cook it, though.

14:25.471 --> 14:28.305
Me, too.

14:28.307 --> 14:30.574
Usually, city folks
are a little squeamish

14:30.576 --> 14:32.343
about the killing part.

14:32.345 --> 14:34.978
You used to go hunting with your dad?

14:38.750 --> 14:40.751
A few times.

14:40.753 --> 14:43.821
You and Dad working together?

14:43.823 --> 14:45.489
I don't think so.

14:45.491 --> 14:48.058
Remember the time the two of you
tried to fix the garage door?

14:48.060 --> 14:50.294
I thought you were
gonna have a fistfight.

14:50.296 --> 14:53.597
So I just don't buy this whole

14:53.599 --> 14:54.965
"Garrett is the accomplice" theory.

14:54.967 --> 14:56.567
So, before,

14:56.569 --> 14:58.502
when you thought the Silver Bells Killer

14:58.504 --> 15:00.971
might be just me...

15:04.042 --> 15:06.777
Water under the bridge?

15:10.782 --> 15:13.317
So, well, I just...

15:14.620 --> 15:16.053
I just came by

15:16.055 --> 15:18.655
to tell you that, um...

15:21.393 --> 15:24.128
I'm on your side.

15:24.130 --> 15:25.829
Thank you.

15:26.898 --> 15:29.533
Is there anything I can do for you?

15:29.535 --> 15:31.769
No.

15:31.771 --> 15:33.504
Well, if you think of something,
you let me know.

15:33.506 --> 15:34.805
I'll let you know.

15:44.249 --> 15:47.050
I'm okay.

15:51.122 --> 15:54.324
I've, um, I've-I've got to go.

15:54.326 --> 15:55.692
You got a speech to make somewhere?

15:55.694 --> 15:57.261
No. I'm...

15:57.263 --> 16:00.898
meeting with an employee.

16:00.900 --> 16:03.967
I am a top-notch reporter.

16:03.969 --> 16:06.937
My potential is limitless.

16:09.040 --> 16:12.409
Many people look up to me.

16:12.411 --> 16:15.879
And if I don't do
exactly as Alison says,

16:15.881 --> 16:17.848
I'll end up in jail.

16:20.785 --> 16:23.187
You know, you probably should
start locking your door.

16:23.189 --> 16:24.655
The lock's broken. The super's on it.

16:24.657 --> 16:25.989
What do you want?

16:25.991 --> 16:28.659
I need you to get
me something on Conley.

16:28.661 --> 16:31.128
What? By some miracle,

16:31.130 --> 16:33.697
I seem to only be
trailing him by seven points.

16:33.699 --> 16:35.766
Striking distance.

16:35.768 --> 16:39.236
And I now have a delightful
secret weapon in you.

16:39.238 --> 16:41.405
You're shameless,

16:41.407 --> 16:44.007
morally ambiguous,

16:44.009 --> 16:46.877
but with the appearance of objectivity.

16:46.879 --> 16:48.846
You're the whole package, Jen.

16:48.848 --> 16:51.081
I want you

16:51.083 --> 16:52.683
to take him down.

16:52.685 --> 16:54.685
He's the mayor.

16:54.687 --> 16:57.054
- How am I supposed to get any...?
- You figured out

16:57.056 --> 16:59.723
how to put an illegal
listening device in my mother's house.

16:59.725 --> 17:01.892
Dig deep.

17:03.161 --> 17:05.429
Take his housekeeper out for coffee.

17:05.431 --> 17:06.930
Follow him.

17:06.932 --> 17:10.000
Just get me something I can use.

17:10.002 --> 17:13.002
Or you can start doing
those daily affirmations

17:13.005 --> 17:14.605
from your cell.

17:20.078 --> 17:21.744
Time for dinner.

17:33.057 --> 17:35.125
The rabbit's cooked perfectly.

17:35.127 --> 17:36.593
Need a new knife.

17:38.496 --> 17:40.764
Just needs sharpening is all.

17:40.766 --> 17:42.466
Why are you so attached to that thing?

17:42.468 --> 17:43.934
Sentimental value?

17:45.336 --> 17:47.671
Yeah, something like that.

17:47.673 --> 17:49.339
You never talk about your family.

17:50.375 --> 17:52.609
Neither do you.

17:52.611 --> 17:54.478
They're all dead.

17:54.480 --> 17:55.779
Your turn.

17:55.781 --> 17:57.915
They're all dead.

17:59.051 --> 18:01.184
We're just not very close is all.

18:03.555 --> 18:05.455
Well, I was with my little sister.

18:05.457 --> 18:06.857
Tessa.

18:09.594 --> 18:11.461
I had a niece

18:11.463 --> 18:13.163
named Julie.

18:14.533 --> 18:16.800
It was kind of the same thing, you know?

18:16.802 --> 18:19.369
My family... they were fine, I guess,

18:19.371 --> 18:21.371
but Julie?

18:21.373 --> 18:23.040
She was a good egg.

18:23.042 --> 18:26.810
She played the oboe.

18:28.347 --> 18:29.980
I mean, you can find people all over

18:29.982 --> 18:32.282
who play the piano or the guitar,

18:32.284 --> 18:34.685
but the oboe... that's rare.

18:36.255 --> 18:39.489
After college, I think

18:39.491 --> 18:41.658
she could've played in any orchestra

18:41.660 --> 18:43.126
through the whole damn country.

18:43.128 --> 18:45.996
New York,
Philadelphia, Boston, you name it.

18:45.998 --> 18:47.731
So what happened?

18:49.834 --> 18:52.069
Car wreck.

18:52.071 --> 18:53.870
Drunk driver.

18:53.872 --> 18:55.138
Middle of the day,

18:55.140 --> 18:58.508
drunk out of his mind.

19:00.745 --> 19:03.513
I've lost all the members of my family

19:03.515 --> 19:05.549
through the years.

19:05.551 --> 19:07.017
I hardly even think of 'em.

19:07.019 --> 19:09.019
But Julie...

19:09.021 --> 19:10.921
I think about her a lot.

19:12.690 --> 19:16.226
If I could see her just one more time...

19:20.064 --> 19:21.665
But I can't.

19:21.667 --> 19:23.066
That's that.

19:29.607 --> 19:31.074
You miss Tessa?

19:33.511 --> 19:38.482
We used to come up here
in the summers, camping.

19:38.484 --> 19:40.050
That's how I know the area so well.

19:40.052 --> 19:41.885
I still go back and...

19:41.887 --> 19:44.187
check if they're there, sometimes.

19:44.189 --> 19:46.857
That must've been rich people camping.

19:46.859 --> 19:48.792
'Cause when I met you,

19:48.794 --> 19:50.594
you didn't know a damn thing.

19:50.596 --> 19:52.562
Oh, yeah. Big lake house,

19:52.564 --> 19:55.165
five bedrooms, three bath.

19:55.167 --> 19:56.500
Yeah, that's camping

19:56.502 --> 19:58.168
like grocery shopping is hunting.

20:06.878 --> 20:11.415
Well... here's to family.

20:12.483 --> 20:15.285
The ones we like, anyway.

20:18.890 --> 20:20.957
You know what I just realized?

20:20.959 --> 20:23.293
Someone could've planted
that knife in his old cabin

20:23.295 --> 20:24.561
to frame him.

20:24.563 --> 20:26.196
I mean, think about it.

20:26.198 --> 20:27.731
Right?

20:27.733 --> 20:29.766
The real killer could've
seen Garrett's face

20:29.768 --> 20:31.168
on the television a few weeks ago

20:31.170 --> 20:32.602
when the police were hunting him down,

20:32.604 --> 20:34.071
saw an opportunity,

20:34.073 --> 20:35.439
found out where he
lived in Maine, and...

20:35.441 --> 20:36.606
Tess, stop.

20:36.608 --> 20:38.175
Okay? Just stop.

20:38.177 --> 20:41.611
This loyalty to him, I...

20:41.613 --> 20:42.979
I understand.

20:42.981 --> 20:44.948
And, in a way, it is very touching.

20:44.950 --> 20:47.084
But, Tess, at some point,

20:47.086 --> 20:49.720
you have to face the reality
of what's going on.

20:49.722 --> 20:52.122
You were sure... Everybody was sure...

20:52.124 --> 20:54.758
That the DNA would match him. It didn't.

20:54.760 --> 20:56.760
Why don't you go down there and ask him?

20:56.762 --> 20:57.994
Point-blank.

20:57.996 --> 20:59.296
What?

20:59.298 --> 21:00.363
Go down to the jail,

21:00.365 --> 21:01.665
look him in the eye

21:01.667 --> 21:03.700
and ask him if he was involved.

21:03.702 --> 21:05.836
You would know

21:05.838 --> 21:08.071
if he's telling the truth
more than anyone, right?

21:08.073 --> 21:09.539
You want me to do your bidding?

21:09.541 --> 21:11.007
You want to use me

21:11.009 --> 21:12.743
against my brother?

21:12.745 --> 21:14.511
No, that's not what I'm saying. You do.

21:14.513 --> 21:16.513
Our goal is the same here,
don't you get that?

21:16.515 --> 21:17.681
I'm not the enemy.

21:17.683 --> 21:20.317
We both want the truth.

21:20.319 --> 21:23.086
Don't you need to know for yourself?

21:26.758 --> 21:28.859
Ask him.

22:59.152 --> 23:02.121
Damn, how is that water still so cold?

23:02.123 --> 23:04.623
Come here, Jack-Jack.

23:04.625 --> 23:07.159
You know, Tessa's a natural with kids.

23:07.161 --> 23:08.961
- Mom!
- What?

23:08.963 --> 23:10.563
It's been two months!

23:10.565 --> 23:12.098
Don't freak him out.

23:12.100 --> 23:14.533
So, how did you and Sophie meet?

23:14.535 --> 23:17.169
You know, before I knew who she was,

23:17.171 --> 23:19.805
I kept seeing her around
in different places, like

23:19.807 --> 23:23.375
coffee shop, movies, bookstore.

23:23.377 --> 23:25.177
And then this one day in the park...

23:25.179 --> 23:26.879
That fateful day in the park.

23:26.881 --> 23:29.482
When she just popped up in front of you.

23:29.484 --> 23:31.183
And said, "Hi, I'm Sophie,

23:31.185 --> 23:34.019
and I'm gonna be your girlfriend."

23:35.523 --> 23:37.389
She was right.

23:38.759 --> 23:39.959
Where's Dad?

23:39.961 --> 23:41.393
Oh, uh, he and Tom

23:41.395 --> 23:44.029
- went to get lighter fluid.
- No!

23:44.031 --> 23:45.931
That is cheating! We are
building a bonfire!

23:45.933 --> 23:49.835
Old school, like we used to.

23:51.706 --> 23:53.839
What was that?

23:53.841 --> 23:56.308
I think that's a red-tailed hawk.

23:59.113 --> 24:00.713
Cool.

24:00.715 --> 24:03.449
Anybody want to help me with dinner?

24:03.451 --> 24:04.817
No, I'm good.

24:04.819 --> 24:06.118
I'll come taste things. Okay.

24:06.120 --> 24:08.120
Suck-up.

24:08.122 --> 24:09.789
Come on, Jack, let's go.

24:09.791 --> 24:11.357
Come on.

24:12.894 --> 24:15.427
Dad, can we go see Mommy?

24:17.899 --> 24:22.067
Good-bye, red-tailed hawk.

24:56.069 --> 24:57.837
Hello?

24:57.839 --> 24:59.772
Garrett?

24:59.774 --> 25:01.040
Garrett, is that you?

25:01.042 --> 25:02.708
Hey, Tess.

25:02.710 --> 25:04.543
I found that number in my backpack.

25:04.545 --> 25:06.745
When did you put it there?

25:08.448 --> 25:10.449
I dropped by the lake house.

25:10.451 --> 25:12.618
You were there, where we were?

25:12.620 --> 25:14.220
Why didn't you come find me?

25:14.222 --> 25:15.988
I just saw you and

25:15.990 --> 25:19.191
I wanted you to have a way
of getting in touch with me.

25:19.193 --> 25:20.492
If you need it.

25:20.494 --> 25:22.261
I can't believe

25:22.263 --> 25:24.997
I'm hearing your voice
after all this time.

25:24.999 --> 25:27.233
I miss you so much.

25:27.235 --> 25:29.835
Yeah, I miss you, too.

25:31.905 --> 25:35.341
Oh, my God, I have a million questions.

25:35.343 --> 25:39.578
Uh, why did you leave home
and when are you coming back?

25:39.580 --> 25:42.848
And do you have a job
and do you have a girlfriend?

25:42.850 --> 25:44.350
Are you happy?

25:44.352 --> 25:45.818
I got to go, Tess.

25:45.820 --> 25:47.553
Wait. We'll talk again soon.

25:48.388 --> 25:51.523
I... I promise.

25:51.525 --> 25:53.859
Okay.

25:57.664 --> 25:59.865
You know the bird you heard?

26:01.701 --> 26:03.335
That wasn't a red-tailed hawk,

26:03.337 --> 26:05.704
that was a red-shouldered hawk.

26:05.706 --> 26:08.107
They're the noisy ones.

26:08.109 --> 26:11.143
The red-tailed hawks...

26:11.145 --> 26:13.345
are mostly quiet.

26:14.414 --> 26:16.015
I love you, Garrett.

26:20.353 --> 26:22.388
Yeah, you, too.

26:24.291 --> 26:26.859
Thanks.

26:32.832 --> 26:35.434
Hey.

26:37.003 --> 26:38.203
Hey.

26:40.741 --> 26:42.508
How are you doing?

26:44.678 --> 26:46.512
So?

26:47.914 --> 26:51.050
Did you hear a heartbeat?

26:51.952 --> 26:53.152
Oh, yeah.

26:53.154 --> 26:55.220
Yeah.

26:55.222 --> 26:56.855
Yeah?

26:56.857 --> 26:58.123
Everything's good.

26:58.125 --> 27:00.359
It is?

27:00.361 --> 27:02.361
How are you holding up?

27:02.363 --> 27:04.363
I'm fine.

27:08.335 --> 27:13.038
How did that knife wind up
in your old cabin, Garrett?

27:13.040 --> 27:16.642
Tess...

27:17.844 --> 27:19.111
Garrett...

27:19.113 --> 27:21.347
Don't.

27:21.349 --> 27:23.215
Please talk to me.

27:25.952 --> 27:28.454
I don't think you're a killer.

27:33.226 --> 27:36.362
But for my own peace of mind...

27:36.364 --> 27:38.831
I need to hear you say it.

27:38.833 --> 27:41.834
I know you're not saying
anything to the police,

27:41.836 --> 27:43.669
I understand that.

27:47.540 --> 27:49.842
It's just me, Garrett.

27:52.712 --> 27:55.614
This isn't hard.

27:55.616 --> 28:00.652
Just tell me you never killed anyone.

28:12.599 --> 28:14.433
I can't do that.

28:50.202 --> 28:53.070
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:55.942 --> 28:57.408
You were right.

28:57.410 --> 28:58.776
What do you mean?

28:58.778 --> 29:00.578
I've been naive.

29:01.313 --> 29:03.681
In denial.

29:05.450 --> 29:08.519
Garrett put this beside my
bed the night that he left.

29:08.521 --> 29:11.022
I know you've been
re-canvassing the neighborhoods

29:11.024 --> 29:12.256
where the murders happened.

29:12.258 --> 29:13.858
Looking for witnesses.

29:13.860 --> 29:16.694
Somebody who maybe saw
something without realizing it.

29:16.696 --> 29:19.297
This was taken at
the height of the panic.

29:19.299 --> 29:23.601
Maybe it'll jog somebody's memory.

29:23.603 --> 29:27.238
I'll do anything I can to help.

29:28.473 --> 29:30.408
You know,

29:30.410 --> 29:32.043
when you're canvassing the crime scene

29:32.045 --> 29:36.914
and you ask people,
"Did you see anybody?",

29:36.916 --> 29:38.850
a lot of the time it's
hard for them to remember.

29:38.852 --> 29:42.720
But when you can hold up
a photograph and say,

29:42.722 --> 29:44.422
"Did you see this guy?",

29:44.424 --> 29:46.290
well,

29:46.292 --> 29:48.192
sometimes that jogs the memory.

29:48.194 --> 29:51.362
I like you.

29:51.364 --> 29:52.730
What?

29:52.732 --> 29:55.199
I like you.

29:55.201 --> 29:57.668
I do.

29:57.670 --> 30:02.173
I think you're a good person.

30:02.175 --> 30:04.842
I think you're good for my sister.

30:04.844 --> 30:07.578
So I'm happy.

30:07.580 --> 30:11.916
Happy that she married a good cop.

30:11.918 --> 30:13.684
And congrats on the baby.

30:13.686 --> 30:15.186
That's really great.

30:15.188 --> 30:17.154
I don't know what kind
of bizarre mind games

30:17.156 --> 30:18.689
you're trying to play with me...

30:18.691 --> 30:19.158
I'm not.

30:19.183 --> 30:20.558
But here's what
you need to understand...

30:20.560 --> 30:23.594
She believed in you.

30:23.596 --> 30:25.062
She defended you.

30:25.064 --> 30:27.565
And now you lost even her, Garrett.

30:27.567 --> 30:30.701
Your last true supporter in the world.

30:32.237 --> 30:34.605
So if the D.A. comes at you

30:34.607 --> 30:36.374
with any kind of a deal,

30:36.376 --> 30:38.376
you take it.

30:38.378 --> 30:39.777
Because we're re-canvassing.

30:39.779 --> 30:41.946
And we will find a witness.

30:41.948 --> 30:45.049
Because somewhere along
the line, you slipped up.

30:45.051 --> 30:47.485
There is no way

30:47.487 --> 30:49.253
you could've done everything

30:49.255 --> 30:51.822
that you did without being seen.

30:57.496 --> 31:00.231
Nobody saw you?

31:00.233 --> 31:02.366
Man, you've got some creep to you.

31:02.368 --> 31:05.236
So, how was it?

31:05.238 --> 31:07.071
Was great.

31:07.073 --> 31:09.073
My little sister's all grown up.

31:09.075 --> 31:11.976
Tessa, she's...

31:11.978 --> 31:14.278
she's got a boyfriend.

31:14.280 --> 31:17.081
And my other sister Alison,
she's out here.

31:17.083 --> 31:19.150
She's pregnant.

31:19.152 --> 31:21.519
Uh, my little brother is, he's married.

31:21.521 --> 31:23.521
With a kid.

31:26.159 --> 31:28.092
My little brother's got a kid.

31:28.094 --> 31:29.360
I'm an uncle.

31:29.362 --> 31:31.729
That's how that works.

31:33.766 --> 31:36.734
I'm the oldest, so I-I always
thought it would be me.

31:36.736 --> 31:40.438
Getting married first and having kids.

31:40.440 --> 31:43.274
Well, maybe somebody
will come along for you.

31:44.543 --> 31:46.310
That's not in the cards for me anymore.

31:46.312 --> 31:47.912
Listen.

31:47.914 --> 31:50.815
You just never know how
things are gonna turn out.

31:50.817 --> 31:53.617
You never knew you were
gonna spend all these years

31:53.619 --> 31:56.988
out here in the woods
eating rabbits with me.

32:03.261 --> 32:06.864
That cough's getting worse, huh?

32:08.000 --> 32:10.067
You okay?

32:10.069 --> 32:11.769
No.

32:11.771 --> 32:15.272
It's congestive heart failure.

32:15.274 --> 32:18.542
Pretty far along, too.

32:18.544 --> 32:20.277
Aren't you a little young for that?

32:20.279 --> 32:21.545
You're just now

32:21.547 --> 32:24.081
figuring out that life ain't fair?

32:25.551 --> 32:27.651
It'll probably kill
me one of these days.

32:27.653 --> 32:29.920
But don't you worry about it.

32:29.922 --> 32:34.091
I can still kick the crap
out of you if I have to.

32:35.862 --> 32:37.461
Our special correspondent
Jennifer Windham

32:37.463 --> 32:39.797
is on assignment, so the Channel 12

32:39.799 --> 32:43.034
Undercover Report will
not be seen at this time.

32:43.036 --> 32:45.069
So I've been following Mayor Conley,

32:45.071 --> 32:46.337
which has not been easy.

32:46.339 --> 32:47.905
Don't care.

32:47.907 --> 32:49.140
And at first, I didn't think

32:49.142 --> 32:50.808
I was gonna find anything worthwhile.

32:50.810 --> 32:52.777
Well, I can see that.

32:52.779 --> 32:54.779
And then this happened.

32:57.015 --> 32:59.817
That's the lead detective
in the SBK case.

32:59.819 --> 33:01.619
They know each other.

33:01.621 --> 33:02.987
Why meet in secret?

33:02.989 --> 33:04.388
I don't know.

33:04.390 --> 33:06.357
But I'm digging.

33:06.359 --> 33:09.593
And if I get anything good,
it'll be on my 5:00 report.

33:17.169 --> 33:18.669
Brought you a book.

33:18.671 --> 33:21.605
Oh, great. Put it in the...

33:26.545 --> 33:29.213
Escape from Alcatraz.

33:29.215 --> 33:30.815
I thought it might be helpful.

33:30.817 --> 33:32.383
Yeah, it might be.

33:32.385 --> 33:33.651
Thanks.

33:33.653 --> 33:36.387
I brought you this, too.

33:36.389 --> 33:38.055
Wow.

33:38.057 --> 33:40.858
What is that... is that
a made-up creature or...?

33:40.860 --> 33:42.393
No.

33:42.395 --> 33:44.562
It's Yersinia pestis.

33:44.564 --> 33:46.630
Uh-huh.

33:46.632 --> 33:48.432
It's the bacterium
that causes bubonic plague.

33:48.434 --> 33:50.367
It killed 25 million people

33:50.369 --> 33:55.005
between the years of 1347 and 1352.

33:55.007 --> 33:57.475
No one ever put it in jail.

33:57.477 --> 34:00.077
Good point.

34:00.079 --> 34:02.980
I hope you get out soon.

34:02.982 --> 34:05.583
Yeah, me, too, buddy.

34:11.456 --> 34:14.525
Oh, and I saw your girlfriend
the other day.

34:14.527 --> 34:15.960
"Girlfriend"?

34:15.962 --> 34:17.895
The lady who stabbed you.

34:17.897 --> 34:19.029
Christina?

34:19.031 --> 34:20.063
Yeah.

34:20.065 --> 34:21.632
Where'd you see her?

34:21.634 --> 34:24.702
When Aunt Tessa took me
to do her ultrasound.

34:24.704 --> 34:26.637
She must have a new job.

34:26.639 --> 34:28.873
Oh, she wasn't there as a doctor.

34:28.875 --> 34:31.208
She was a patient.

34:31.210 --> 34:33.744
I got to go.

34:35.514 --> 34:37.181
Bye.

34:45.991 --> 34:47.091
Christina, it's Garrett.

34:47.092 --> 34:48.159
Please don't hang up.

34:48.161 --> 34:50.527
Listen.

34:50.530 --> 34:53.130
My nephew, he came to see me.

34:53.132 --> 34:56.033
And he sa...

34:56.034 --> 34:58.636
Oh, you saw him, too, huh?

35:01.840 --> 35:05.476
Uh, look, I-I'm wondering...

35:07.579 --> 35:10.314
I got to know.

35:11.550 --> 35:13.884
Really?

35:13.886 --> 35:16.487
No, wait-wait, Christina.

35:20.892 --> 35:24.028
Wrap it up.

35:24.030 --> 35:26.096
Just-just one minute.

35:26.098 --> 35:27.398
I got to call my lawyer.

35:27.400 --> 35:30.568
- Got to go.
- Please?

35:33.505 --> 35:36.073
Darcy, it's Garrett.

35:37.275 --> 35:40.277
Listen, I need to get out of here now.

35:43.950 --> 35:45.983
What's changed?

35:45.985 --> 35:47.985
Uh...

35:49.521 --> 35:52.356
If I tell you, then-then that's covered

35:52.358 --> 35:54.959
by the lawyer/client privilege
thing, right?

35:54.961 --> 35:57.595
Okay.

36:00.632 --> 36:03.200
I'm gonna be a father.

36:12.208 --> 36:14.408
Garrett's lawyer has
been in there all day.

36:14.410 --> 36:16.944
She's been taking
meticulous inventory of the evidence.

36:16.946 --> 36:18.979
Trying to get him off on a technicality.

36:18.981 --> 36:20.247
She's been intent on independently

36:20.249 --> 36:22.549
testing everything.

36:22.551 --> 36:24.151
Dana?

36:25.286 --> 36:27.154
This is unnecessary.

36:27.156 --> 36:28.956
I never make mistakes.

36:28.958 --> 36:31.158
Speaking in absolutes is a mistake.

36:31.160 --> 36:32.626
Fine.

36:32.628 --> 36:35.429
You want to waste
your time, waste your time.

36:35.431 --> 36:37.865
Find anything on the cuff link

36:37.867 --> 36:39.900
from the David Morales crime scene?

36:39.902 --> 36:42.636
I never processed a cuff link.

36:42.638 --> 36:45.506
Because it vanished
before you got the chance.

36:46.774 --> 36:49.076
Well, it's probably just been misplaced.

36:49.078 --> 36:50.611
It's gonna turn up.

36:50.613 --> 36:52.346
Or not. It doesn't matter.

36:52.348 --> 36:54.014
I now have proof this department

36:54.016 --> 36:56.016
doesn't track evidence correctly.

36:56.018 --> 36:57.651
Things are getting lost.

36:57.653 --> 36:59.887
Maybe mislabeled, maybe on purpose.

36:59.889 --> 37:02.189
It'll be a full-scale police conspiracy

37:02.191 --> 37:04.758
before I finish my opening statement.

37:06.060 --> 37:08.795
Apparently Darcy
Campano already has something.

37:08.797 --> 37:10.364
So she's taking care of everything

37:10.366 --> 37:11.865
on the legal side to get me out.

37:11.867 --> 37:13.033
What I need you to do

37:13.035 --> 37:15.302
is... whatever

37:15.304 --> 37:18.372
inside political thing that you do.

37:18.374 --> 37:20.641
Wow, this place got to you in a hurry.

37:20.643 --> 37:23.443
Yeah, sure, b-but, Ali,

37:23.445 --> 37:25.913
can you help me?

37:25.915 --> 37:27.548
Sure, I'll meet

37:27.550 --> 37:29.283
with the D.A. and see if
there's anything I can do...

37:29.285 --> 37:30.450
Tonight at 5:00, our special
correspondent Jennifer Windham

37:30.452 --> 37:32.753
has an exclusive story
with new information

37:32.755 --> 37:34.188
about the SBK accomplice.

37:34.190 --> 37:36.190
Tune in for our
special report tonight at 5:00.

37:36.192 --> 37:37.891
I've got to go.

37:37.893 --> 37:41.061
But I think things are about to
get a lot better for both of us.

37:41.063 --> 37:42.963
Trust me, okay?

37:42.965 --> 37:44.031
I'll handle it.

37:44.033 --> 37:45.165
Okay.

37:45.934 --> 37:48.669
Ali, wait.

37:49.704 --> 37:52.439
I need you to give
Tess a message for me.

37:52.441 --> 37:54.408
Just tell her that I couldn't give her

37:54.410 --> 37:55.676
the answer she wanted, but...

37:57.078 --> 37:59.613
Tell her I need a chance to explain.

37:59.615 --> 38:01.982
Okay.

38:12.193 --> 38:14.161
Jenkins!

38:14.163 --> 38:16.763
Let's go. I caught it, you cook it.

38:30.379 --> 38:32.179
Where's your medicine?

38:32.181 --> 38:33.447
Where's your medicine?

38:33.449 --> 38:35.048
Too late for it!

38:36.417 --> 38:39.019
Let's get you to a hospital,
come on, come on!

38:39.021 --> 38:40.220
No!

38:40.222 --> 38:41.355
This is it.

38:41.357 --> 38:42.623
End stage.

38:42.625 --> 38:45.325
I came up here to die.

38:45.327 --> 38:46.460
I need help.

38:46.462 --> 38:48.228
Come on, I'll help you up.

38:48.230 --> 38:50.464
Not like that.

38:50.466 --> 38:52.666
Help me, please.

38:56.037 --> 38:57.971
Help me.

38:57.973 --> 39:00.474
Help me die.

39:00.476 --> 39:01.575
Please.

39:01.577 --> 39:03.710
I can't.

39:04.846 --> 39:06.880
Damn it, help me.

39:06.882 --> 39:07.881
I can't!

39:07.883 --> 39:08.915
Help me.

39:08.917 --> 39:10.417
I can't.

39:11.920 --> 39:14.521
I can't.

39:16.725 --> 39:19.459
I'm begging you.

39:19.461 --> 39:22.062
Okay, okay.

39:33.975 --> 39:36.710
Okay.

40:59.093 --> 41:02.329
Hey.

41:02.331 --> 41:05.665
Uh, your sister Tessa called.

41:05.667 --> 41:08.201
Your dad's in the hospital.

41:19.213 --> 41:21.848
We told you earlier today
that our special correspondent

41:21.850 --> 41:23.917
Jennifer Windham has made
a shocking discovery

41:23.919 --> 41:26.386
in the Silver Bells case.

41:26.388 --> 41:28.522
We go live to her now

41:28.524 --> 41:29.823
for that exclusive report.

41:29.825 --> 41:32.025
Jennifer?

41:33.327 --> 41:34.761
Uh, we seem to be having

41:34.763 --> 41:36.463
a little trouble with our live feed.

41:36.465 --> 41:38.064
Okay, here we go.

41:39.568 --> 41:40.834
Hello, I'm Jennifer Windham.

41:40.836 --> 41:42.469
And I do have new information

41:42.471 --> 41:44.838
in the Silver Bells case.

41:45.940 --> 41:48.442
I've been told to read the following,

41:48.444 --> 41:51.611
"The police believe
the Silver Bells Killer

41:51.613 --> 41:52.979
had an accomplice.

41:52.981 --> 41:54.147
He did.

41:54.149 --> 41:57.884
It was me.

41:57.886 --> 42:00.487
And I would've stayed quiet,

42:00.489 --> 42:02.522
but you wouldn't
leave well enough alone.

42:02.524 --> 42:04.291
You kept digging.

42:04.293 --> 42:05.992
And now I'm back.

42:05.994 --> 42:07.594
But if you forget about me,

42:07.596 --> 42:11.231
I will forget about all of you.

42:11.233 --> 42:13.900

He tried to kill me.
