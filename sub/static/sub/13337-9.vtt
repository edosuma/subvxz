WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:00.200
.

00:08.480 --> 00:12.080
The Geordies are back. We're leaving
the Toon and hitting Greece.

00:12.920 --> 00:15.440
Greece, you're about to get done.

00:15.520 --> 00:17.280
(cheering)

00:17.360 --> 00:18.840
Come on!

00:20.280 --> 00:21.880
It's gonna be pool parties...

00:21.960 --> 00:23.720
Boat parties...

00:24.520 --> 00:25.640
More drama.

00:27.040 --> 00:28.360
Fuck this shit!

00:30.200 --> 00:31.320
More tashing on.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.760
More fucking tragedy.

00:37.040 --> 00:38.040
Slag!

00:38.120 --> 00:39.480
(shouting)

00:39.560 --> 00:41.000
(exhales heavily)

00:41.080 --> 00:43.560
Don't fucking ever
speak to me again.

00:43.640 --> 00:44.760
(sobbing)

00:44.840 --> 00:46.800
(spits)

00:46.880 --> 00:48.400
Total carnage.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.280
Fuck! Shit! What have I done now?

00:56.520 --> 00:59.120
And a shitload of bucking, like.

01:01.440 --> 01:06.000
Greece, the Geordie gods are coming.
Time to get immortal.

01:09.560 --> 01:12.720
Now that he's gone,
I'm still gonna be heartbroken.

01:12.800 --> 01:14.040
(sobs)

01:14.120 --> 01:17.040
Why can't she see that Kyle was
an absolute dick to her?

01:21.000 --> 01:23.160
She needs to try
and have some fun with us.

01:23.240 --> 01:27.400
I don't see my Holly.
I can't see my Holly.

01:27.480 --> 01:28.600
I can't see her.

01:28.680 --> 01:31.160
Listen. Listen.
I know!

01:31.240 --> 01:33.200
I fucking know!
Stop it!

01:33.280 --> 01:37.040
What's so hard is that I know that
what everyone's saying is true.

01:37.120 --> 01:39.400
I'm just gonna try and have fun
and forget.

01:39.480 --> 01:40.600
(all laugh)

01:41.600 --> 01:43.920
(Gaz) Holly tonight
is back to her old self.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.880
I look over, and Holly and Scott
are flirting. What the fuck?

01:47.960 --> 01:49.960
I don't trust Holly.

01:50.040 --> 01:52.920
(Scott)I wish
Chloe would leave us alone.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.400
Everyone's together,
and I feel so alone.

01:59.080 --> 02:00.120
(sobs)

02:02.000 --> 02:04.120
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.200
I never kiss without a six-pack.

02:06.280 --> 02:09.080
I'm a natural beauty,
real boobs, real hair.

02:09.160 --> 02:11.280
I'm gonna tear the place up.

02:11.360 --> 02:13.440
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

02:13.520 --> 02:15.320
I'm preened to perfection.

02:15.400 --> 02:17.520
I'm cheeky and full of mischief.

02:17.600 --> 02:19.360
I'm fit, flirty and I've got FFs.

02:19.440 --> 02:21.760
I'm gonna make sparks fly.

02:21.840 --> 02:24.520
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:29.040 --> 02:31.200
We have to say goodbye to the boat,

02:31.280 --> 02:34.640
but then again, we're off back
to Zante and I can't fucking wait.

02:43.560 --> 02:46.680
Zante! Zante! Zante! Zante!

02:48.280 --> 02:50.160
We've arrived back in Zante,

02:50.240 --> 02:53.400
and I can't wait to get back
to that villa and get pissed.

02:53.480 --> 02:54.800
Zante, here we come!

02:59.480 --> 03:02.600
Everyone's absolutely buzzing
to be back in this villa.

03:02.680 --> 03:05.080
Whoo!
Back to the fucking villa.

03:05.160 --> 03:06.920
(laughter)

03:07.000 --> 03:08.960
Fucking hell, this feels amazing.

03:09.040 --> 03:12.280
There's so much space,
there's wardrobes, it's clean.

03:12.360 --> 03:14.400
Hi, villa. I've missed you so much.

03:15.920 --> 03:17.080
Party!

03:17.160 --> 03:19.000
Pure excited for tonight.

03:19.080 --> 03:21.880
I just hope Holly stays happy,
Chloe stays silent.

03:21.960 --> 03:23.880
Then everyone will be loving life.

03:32.520 --> 03:34.880
I am so excited for tonight.

03:34.960 --> 03:38.000
Felt like everyone was happy
last night. I enjoyed it.

03:38.080 --> 03:40.120
I seen a big difference in you,
Holly.

03:40.200 --> 03:43.040
Yeah, I feel like
I'm in a much better place today.

03:43.120 --> 03:46.440
I've just gone through
a really, really traumatic breakup.

03:46.520 --> 03:50.080
But I feel like I turned a corner.
I hope every night is like that.

03:50.160 --> 03:52.800
Yeah, me too.
Me three.

03:52.880 --> 03:56.640
Holly's saying she's in a good
place. Cos you were all over my lad.

03:56.720 --> 03:57.960
But I need to suck it up.

03:58.040 --> 04:00.840
I don't wanna get in an argument
over Scott.

04:02.200 --> 04:05.720
Our first night back in Zante,
so I definitely wanna pull.

04:05.800 --> 04:09.680
Now we're back in Zante, Nathan
has got boys and girls on tap.

04:09.760 --> 04:11.600
So hopefully he won't get pied.

04:11.680 --> 04:13.560
What you fancying, boy or girl?

04:13.640 --> 04:17.880
I'm gonna stick with lads for a bit.
Get him to the chopper.

04:17.960 --> 04:20.080
I was on such a lucky streak
in Mykonos,

04:20.160 --> 04:23.480
I might pull it out of the bag
in Zante. I might touch a willy.

04:23.560 --> 04:26.520
Cheers.
(all cheer)

04:29.920 --> 04:32.760
Fucking Zante!
Zante!

04:40.240 --> 04:42.200
It's so good to be back out in Zante.

04:42.280 --> 04:44.680
It does feel different
to Mykonos, though.

04:44.760 --> 04:47.600
I feel like we've gone
from class to trash.

04:52.240 --> 04:55.240
The club's bouncing.
Everyone's having a mint night.

04:55.320 --> 04:58.280
I'll play it so cool,
and maybe Scott might want us.

04:58.360 --> 05:01.560
(Aaron)This is why we love Zante.
We get fucking smashed

05:01.640 --> 05:04.400
and jump around like lunatics.
Tonight is wicked.

05:12.640 --> 05:15.600
I'm in the same club
I watched Kyle kiss another girl.

05:15.680 --> 05:19.160
I didn't realise all these feelings
would come flooding back,

05:19.240 --> 05:20.800
and it's weird.

05:20.880 --> 05:23.880
I know that being back in Zante
must be so hard for Holly,

05:23.960 --> 05:26.000
but tonight she is doing amazing.

05:26.080 --> 05:29.440
I actually do believe she's trying
her best to have a good night.

05:29.520 --> 05:31.320
And I'm so proud of her.

05:36.080 --> 05:38.280
Everyone's having
a really good night,

05:38.360 --> 05:42.080
but I really miss my boyfriend,
and I know Charlotte feels the same.

05:52.520 --> 05:55.720
It's so good that I've got
Charlotte to talk to about this.

05:55.800 --> 05:59.440
I don't think it would be right
if I was to talk to Holly about it.

06:04.320 --> 06:05.680
(laughs)

06:05.760 --> 06:08.160
Holly is back in the mix
and on form tonight.

06:08.240 --> 06:11.600
And she's looking alreet as well.
She wants to watch herself,

06:11.680 --> 06:13.880
otherwise I might get in
a bit of bother.

06:29.520 --> 06:31.360
Every single person in this house

06:31.440 --> 06:34.040
seems to think that
the way to get over somebody

06:34.120 --> 06:38.000
is by getting under somebody else.
I don't think that that would work.

06:38.080 --> 06:40.600
And if I did,
it certainly wouldn't be Scott.

06:40.680 --> 06:44.640
It's alreet, pet, I'll be here
when you change your mind.

06:44.720 --> 06:47.840
Scott's not paying me any attention
tonight and I hate it.

06:53.880 --> 06:57.760
I feel sorry for Chloe. She likes
Scott. All he does is wind her up.

06:57.840 --> 07:01.120
Scott tries to piss me off.
I just want someone else to see it.

07:17.160 --> 07:21.480
My head has been all over the place.
I've been thinking a lot of things.

07:23.600 --> 07:27.440
I just need to talk to someone.
I have to get this off my chest.

07:38.240 --> 07:41.040
Oh, my God.
Nathan's telling us he's fully gay.

07:46.560 --> 07:49.200
I'm so glad Nathan's
chosen to spoke to me first.

07:49.280 --> 07:52.320
He's my best friend in the house.
I love him no matter what.

07:57.240 --> 07:59.080
It feels good talking about this.

07:59.160 --> 08:01.520
Like a weight is
lifted off my shoulders.

08:01.600 --> 08:04.400
I can tell Chloe anything
without being scared.

08:08.880 --> 08:11.320
First night back in Zante
has been amazing,

08:11.400 --> 08:13.840
but it's now time
to get back to the villa.

08:19.240 --> 08:20.920
Everyone is in such a good mood,

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
there's only one thing to do,
and that's get in the pool.

08:24.080 --> 08:25.600
Girls, you're up first.

08:27.400 --> 08:28.720
(all laugh)

08:28.800 --> 08:30.360
Why would you do this?!

08:30.440 --> 08:32.520
This is how every night out
should end.

08:32.600 --> 08:34.920
Everyone having a laugh,
no arguments.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.800
This is what Zante should be like.

08:36.880 --> 08:39.040
Aaron, get Marnie.

08:39.120 --> 08:42.240
Please, Aaron. Not the pool.
Not the pool. No, no, no!

08:44.640 --> 08:47.080
The whole family
is buzzing to be back,

08:47.160 --> 08:50.800
and you can tell because everyone
is fucked and having a mint time.

08:53.440 --> 08:55.480
Here, Chloe, have this.

08:56.480 --> 08:57.720
(laughter)

08:57.800 --> 08:59.760
Oh, for fuck's sake!

09:01.040 --> 09:02.800
(all cheer)

09:02.880 --> 09:04.320
I've had such a mint night,

09:04.400 --> 09:06.680
so I'm gonna go to bed
before I fuck it all up.

09:06.760 --> 09:08.600
No kick-offs whatsoever,

09:08.680 --> 09:11.840
so I'm gonna nash the bed
before I fucking jinx myself.

09:23.720 --> 09:27.720
Considering we were all tired,
right, how fun was last night?

09:27.800 --> 09:31.120
We all managed to have a mint night
without any dramas.

09:31.200 --> 09:34.520
And fucking hell, for once,
Chloe didn't even kick off at us.

09:38.400 --> 09:40.840
Last time we were in Zante,
Kyle was here.

09:40.920 --> 09:44.120
So it does feel a little bit weird
waking up with a spare bed

09:44.200 --> 09:47.320
and Kyle's not in it.
Kyle's turned into a fireman.

09:47.400 --> 09:50.360
He's got a bit of a red face though.
You know what I mean?

09:51.280 --> 09:55.280
So glad last night was
such a good success again.

09:55.360 --> 09:56.800
I had a really good night.

09:56.880 --> 09:59.600
It's so nice to see
that the boys do actually care.

09:59.680 --> 10:02.000
They're making such an effort
with Holly,

10:02.080 --> 10:04.040
making the atmosphere amazing.

10:04.120 --> 10:07.160
Finally, we're actually
acting like a proper family.

10:07.240 --> 10:10.520
Chloe, what were you
saying to Nathan last night?

10:10.600 --> 10:14.080
I swore to him that I'd keep it
secret. So I can't tell yous.

10:14.160 --> 10:15.200
Oh.
Oh.

10:15.280 --> 10:17.400
Shit, I shouldn't have
said anything.

10:17.480 --> 10:20.880
Now I've worried the girls.
I should have kept my mouth shut.

10:30.600 --> 10:33.640
Ah! My toe.
So dumb sometimes.

10:33.720 --> 10:36.520
I'm gonna check in with Chloe
about last night.

10:36.600 --> 10:37.800
Today...

10:40.080 --> 10:41.080
Are you?

10:41.160 --> 10:44.080
Nathan seems really nervous,
but there's no need to be.

10:44.160 --> 10:46.440
Everyone will be fine.
Everyone loves him.

10:46.520 --> 10:48.120
Don't be nervous.

10:48.200 --> 10:50.640
Why?
Fear of rejection.

10:50.720 --> 10:52.640
What if the boys don't accept us?

10:52.720 --> 10:56.200
I finally feel like I'm fitting in.
I don't want that to change.

10:56.280 --> 10:57.720
Everyone's gonna be fine.

10:59.640 --> 11:02.440
Even if you were, you know, a horse.

11:02.520 --> 11:04.120
A horse?

11:04.200 --> 11:07.000
Big difference in being a horse
and being gay.

11:07.080 --> 11:10.400
You might just go, "By the way,
guys, I'm half horse, half man."

11:10.480 --> 11:14.240
I'd still love you. Cos I could
just ride you all the time. (laughs)

11:14.320 --> 11:16.920
Even though me and Chloe
argue like cat and dog,

11:17.000 --> 11:20.560
I'm happy she's there for us. No way
I could go through this on my own.

11:20.640 --> 11:22.160
Give us a hug.

11:32.320 --> 11:34.520
(phone rings)

11:35.480 --> 11:38.400
The phone rings and it's bound
to be that bitch, Anna.

11:38.480 --> 11:40.440
What the fuck does she want now?

11:40.520 --> 11:43.520
Hello?
(man)"Hello. Who's that?"

11:43.600 --> 11:46.400
It's Aaron.
"Can you... put Marnie on, please?"

11:46.480 --> 11:47.920
Marnie.
It's Ricky.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.480
Oh, Ricky, fucking hell.

11:49.560 --> 11:53.240
So it's not Anna, it's Marnie's
boyfriend Ricky. Fuck off.

11:53.320 --> 11:55.160
Are you joking?
No, yeah.

11:55.240 --> 11:56.720
What the hell? It's Ricky.

11:56.800 --> 12:00.040
How does he know our number?
Must have got it off Anna.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.640
How are you? I'm fine.

12:01.720 --> 12:04.360
I'm just surprised.
I wasn't expecting a call.

12:04.440 --> 12:07.560
My whole body's shaking.
I'm just so happy to speak to him.

12:07.640 --> 12:10.640
Great. Now another person
who's happy. I'm hating life.

12:10.720 --> 12:13.360
Erm, it is hard being in here
without you, though.

12:15.920 --> 12:17.560
Yeah, I will.

12:19.680 --> 12:22.600
Marnie looks so happy
that her boyfriend's rung her.

12:22.680 --> 12:25.080
They sound so in love.
I wanna be in love.

12:25.160 --> 12:26.880
With someone who loves us back.

12:26.960 --> 12:29.560
Right, I love you, too.
And I'll see you soon.

12:30.760 --> 12:31.960
All right. I love you.

12:32.840 --> 12:34.440
Right. Love you. Bye.

12:34.520 --> 12:37.080
I'm on cloud nine
after speaking to Ricky.

12:37.160 --> 12:40.920
I'm so happy to hear from him.
I'm 100% sure that he is the one.

12:44.320 --> 12:46.160
Marnie's clearly missing Ricky.

12:46.240 --> 12:49.000
And for him to ring her
out of the blue is so lovely.

12:49.080 --> 12:52.880
I've got butterflies, still.
Are you missing him then, Marns?

12:52.960 --> 12:56.760
Yeah.It's always a struggle trying
to have a relationship out here.

12:56.840 --> 13:01.320
Yeah.Especially when they don't
live in the house. And when they do.

13:01.400 --> 13:06.200
I'm so impressed with Marnie.
She hasn't cheated on Ricky once.

13:06.280 --> 13:10.080
Although... we all remember
that night with Chloe.

13:16.400 --> 13:19.280
Guys? Will you just
come inside for a minute?

13:19.360 --> 13:22.960
I feel ready now more than ever.
So I'm gonna gather the family

13:23.040 --> 13:25.240
and let them know
who the real Nathan is.

13:26.280 --> 13:30.040
The last time we were all gathered
together like this, Kyle left.

13:30.120 --> 13:32.080
What is gonna happen this time?

13:32.160 --> 13:34.320
Nathan's about to tell everyone.

13:34.400 --> 13:37.480
He's nervous, but I know
he's strong enough to do it.

13:37.560 --> 13:39.840
I spoke to Chloe yesterday, like.

13:39.920 --> 13:43.440
I just think it's only fair
that I tell yous as well.

13:43.520 --> 13:46.320
I've never been so nervous
in my whole entire life.

13:46.400 --> 13:47.760
I'm shaking like fuck.

13:47.840 --> 13:49.280
Erm...

13:49.360 --> 13:52.920
Normally when someone makes an
announcement, it's something bad.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.600
I don't know what this is gonna be,
but I'm not looking forward to it.

13:56.680 --> 13:58.240
Oh, fuck.

13:58.320 --> 14:01.160
Nathan looks really nervous.
Is that kid all right?

14:01.240 --> 14:03.640
I want yous to know
that nothing's changed.

14:03.720 --> 14:07.160
I haven't changed as a person.
I'm the same person I was before.

14:07.240 --> 14:11.800
And I feel like if I don't tell yous
now, then I can't be myself 100%.

14:11.880 --> 14:14.120
And the only way
I'm gonna be able to be me

14:14.200 --> 14:17.960
is if I'm honest with everyone else,
as well as with myself.

14:18.040 --> 14:21.200
So... basically what I'm
trying to tell yous is, like...

14:21.280 --> 14:23.240
I'm not bi. I'm gay.

14:24.720 --> 14:26.480
Nathan's gay. Is that it?

14:26.560 --> 14:30.520
I've said it. It's out there.
And I feel five stone lighter.

14:30.600 --> 14:33.280
It means more to us,
you telling us that, than not.

14:37.800 --> 14:39.520
The fact that Nathan's now gay,

14:39.600 --> 14:41.800
that doesn't change my opinion
at all.

14:41.880 --> 14:45.160
I loved him when he was bi.
I love him when he's gay.

14:45.240 --> 14:47.960
Nathan, you're not anyone's gay,
you're our gay.

14:48.040 --> 14:49.400
And we fucking love you.

14:49.480 --> 14:52.080
Nathan, man.
I've got loads of gay mates.

14:52.160 --> 14:54.200
And aye, of course
they wanna bang us.

14:54.280 --> 14:58.040
I don't have a problem with it,
cos so does every fucker else.

14:58.120 --> 15:01.360
Everyone is over the moon
he had the confidence to come out.

15:01.440 --> 15:04.600
Everyone loves him.
He had nothing to worry about.

15:04.680 --> 15:06.680
I've been bisexual for seven years,

15:06.760 --> 15:10.160
but looking back on it now,
I don't think I ever was.

15:10.240 --> 15:11.840
I think I've always been gay,

15:11.920 --> 15:14.920
and I just needed that time
to figure it out for myself.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.720
I love you guys.
Love you.

15:16.800 --> 15:18.560
(talking over each other)

15:18.640 --> 15:21.400
I think today should be
happy gay day.

15:22.240 --> 15:24.920
Happy gay day, Nathan! Pssht.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.240
Glitter. Fireworks.
Sparklies. Shwoosh.

15:35.520 --> 15:38.720
I am so proud of Nathan.
That must have been so difficult.

15:38.800 --> 15:40.400
I always knew Nathan was gay.

15:40.480 --> 15:42.800
He never tried it on with me,
so he had to be.

15:42.880 --> 15:44.880
I did have an inkling.
A what?

15:44.960 --> 15:46.800
An inkling that he was gay.
A what?

15:46.880 --> 15:48.280
An inkling.
An inkling.

15:48.360 --> 15:51.480
Inkling? What the fuck's an inkling?

15:51.560 --> 15:53.960
Inkling.Inkling?
It's called an inkling.

15:54.040 --> 15:59.320
Inkling. Come on, Gary. Like,
I've got an inkling you're thick.

16:02.280 --> 16:04.600
Nathan, I'm really proud of you,
you know.

16:04.680 --> 16:06.880
I feel emotional
cos I'm so proud of you.

16:06.960 --> 16:09.400
And I told you everyone
would be fine with it.

16:09.480 --> 16:12.960
There's a difference between that,
and them actually being fine.

16:13.040 --> 16:16.640
I know if I was in your shoes,
I wouldn't be able to do it.

16:16.720 --> 16:19.440
Chloe's been amazing.
She's my shining diamond.

16:19.520 --> 16:23.040
Without her, I wouldn't have had
the strength to tell everyone.

16:23.120 --> 16:25.720
I know everyone in this house
loves you so much.

16:25.800 --> 16:28.400
It doesn't matter who you are,
they'll love you.

16:28.480 --> 16:30.920
I feel like a proud mam at a disco.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.040
And Nathan's just done his first
ever slut drop. He's amazing.

16:40.880 --> 16:43.000
I wanna make today special
for Nathan.

16:43.080 --> 16:44.960
We need to think of fun things to do.

16:45.040 --> 16:48.160
We'll get in the club,
sneak off, take our tops off,

16:48.240 --> 16:52.960
write messages on our chest.
Proper, like, nice stuff, you know?

16:53.040 --> 16:56.000
We'll write the messages
on our chest at the club.

16:56.080 --> 16:58.520
For now, we'll write
one message on our bums.

16:58.600 --> 17:01.840
If you farted right now,
I would go fucking ballistic.

17:01.920 --> 17:05.240
This isn't the usual things we do
when we're getting ready.

17:05.320 --> 17:07.640
Nathan, you better appreciate this.

17:07.720 --> 17:09.680
You're tickling it, like.

17:09.760 --> 17:11.720
(laughter)

17:11.800 --> 17:16.200
Our arses are looking pretty fine.
Nathan is gonna fucking love this.

17:16.280 --> 17:19.200
I hope mans doesn't get Sharpie
on his boxer.

17:29.560 --> 17:32.360
You've been going, like,
"I can't wait for the fun."

17:32.440 --> 17:34.560
I am so happy to have
the old Holly back.

17:34.640 --> 17:36.480
This is the Holly everyone loves.

17:36.560 --> 17:38.160
You're in a better place.

17:38.240 --> 17:40.680
I can't cry any more. He's not here.

17:40.760 --> 17:43.880
When you're happy you are
in this mood that you're in now.

17:43.960 --> 17:46.600
It affects the whole house.
It really does.

17:46.680 --> 17:50.200
I see how much me and Kyle arguing
affected the rest of the house.

17:50.280 --> 17:52.920
Now I've stopped crying
and started having fun,

17:53.000 --> 17:54.840
everybody else is doing the same.

17:54.920 --> 17:57.160
If Holly's up for a good night,
we all are.

17:57.240 --> 17:59.080
I might even get a kiss off Scott.

17:59.160 --> 18:02.320
I'm not gonna lie, you're looking
very pineapple tonight.

18:02.400 --> 18:03.800
Thanks.
You look unreal.

18:03.880 --> 18:08.120
The pineapples represent
my bum hole. You know why? Why?

18:08.200 --> 18:11.200
Cos it's juicy.
(all laugh)

18:11.280 --> 18:15.120
Everyone's being so nice to me. It's
like my birthday, and I'm the queen.

18:15.200 --> 18:18.720
(all) Happy gay day!
(all cheer)

18:18.800 --> 18:19.800
Oh.

18:19.880 --> 18:22.800
There is glitter everywhere.
It's even in my pants.

18:22.880 --> 18:24.480
How the fuck did it get there?

18:24.560 --> 18:26.920
Oh, wow.
(laughter)

18:27.000 --> 18:29.320
The last time I seen
this much glitter

18:29.400 --> 18:31.400
was on my fanny
when I had a vajazzle.

18:31.480 --> 18:33.600
Nathan looks so pretty.
Like my fanny.

18:33.680 --> 18:36.160
Oh, it's stuck!
(all laugh)

18:36.920 --> 18:39.840
Happy gay day, you fucking radgie.

18:45.880 --> 18:48.240
Tonight we're celebrating for Nathan

18:48.320 --> 18:51.520
cos he's now officially
the only gay in the villa. Yoo-hoo!

18:59.520 --> 19:02.280
We get in the club,
and it is fucking going off.

19:03.040 --> 19:07.240
Tonight has been my best night
so far, because it's all about me.

19:23.200 --> 19:26.000
Thanks, Scott.
I guess that's kind of romantic.

19:42.640 --> 19:45.360
Just when I think these boys
can't get any better,

19:45.440 --> 19:49.400
Scotty T offers to spoon me.
Oh, my life has been made.

19:54.800 --> 19:58.000
I'm comfortable with my sexuality,
so I don't give a fuck.

19:58.080 --> 20:01.680
As long as I'm big spoon. I don't
want anything digging in my back.

20:04.040 --> 20:06.040
Everyone's having a wicked time,

20:06.120 --> 20:09.960
so now is the perfect opportunity
to reveal our surprise for Nathan.

20:12.640 --> 20:16.280
Nathan better fucking appreciate
this cos I am absolutely glowing.

20:20.040 --> 20:22.200
Fuck. This is amazing.

20:26.960 --> 20:29.320
Nathan looks absolutely
over the moon.

20:29.400 --> 20:32.240
It even looks like
he's about to shed a tear.

20:32.320 --> 20:34.520
Boom. Nathan, we fucking love you.

20:34.600 --> 20:37.000
Any minute now,
he's gonna go to the toilet,

20:37.080 --> 20:39.960
have himself a Tom Hanks.
Oh, fucking Forrest Pump.

20:43.800 --> 20:46.040
I was scared of telling the lads.

20:46.120 --> 20:49.640
I've just found my place with them
and I was scared of rejection.

20:49.720 --> 20:51.600
But I was wrong to doubt them.

20:51.680 --> 20:54.760
They've been so supportive.
And for that, I love them.

20:59.200 --> 21:02.880
I can't help flirting with Holly.
It's just the way I am.

21:06.680 --> 21:08.600
I can't believe what I'm seeing.

21:08.680 --> 21:12.480
Scott and Holly are all over each
other. Are they taking the piss?

21:12.560 --> 21:15.280
I'm gonna flirt with Aaron,
see what happens.

21:15.360 --> 21:17.000
Hopefully Scott's pissed off.

21:17.080 --> 21:19.080
I feel like a pawn
in someone's game.

21:19.160 --> 21:22.600
Chloe's all over me, trying to
make Scott jealous. Crack on, kid.

21:22.680 --> 21:26.320
Surprise, surprise.
Aaron and Chloe are flirting. Again.

21:26.400 --> 21:28.240
Am I bothered? Am I fuck.

21:30.440 --> 21:32.280
I've finally spotted a fitty.

21:32.360 --> 21:35.720
Fuck it.
It's gay day and I want a kiss.

21:35.800 --> 21:40.040
Yes! Nathan has finally pulled.
Yes, bitches!

21:41.680 --> 21:44.000
(Marnie) I'm having
a really good night.

21:44.080 --> 21:47.120
I'm flirting with Scotty.
It's harmless with him.

21:47.200 --> 21:51.080
Marnie's pecking us
like I'm a fucking oak tree.

21:51.160 --> 21:55.200
If you're gonna do it, do it
properly. Get your tongue out, kid.

21:56.240 --> 21:58.880
Earlier today,
Marnie could not stop telling us

21:58.960 --> 22:00.720
how in love she was with Ricky.

22:00.800 --> 22:03.640
But now she's had a few drinks,
she's all over Scott.

22:03.720 --> 22:07.040
I am so confused. I haven't
got a clue what's happening.

22:10.200 --> 22:12.840
I don't know
what Marnie and Holly have drunk,

22:12.920 --> 22:16.280
but they're climbing up us
like Spider-Man at the Daily Bugle.

22:16.360 --> 22:19.120
When Scott flirts with Marnie,
I don't care.

22:19.200 --> 22:22.400
Holly, it's different.
They've got no respect for us.

22:22.480 --> 22:24.480
Scott's been quite flirty tonight,

22:24.560 --> 22:27.000
and after the shit couple of weeks
I've had,

22:27.080 --> 22:29.280
it's nice just to be
able to have a laugh.

22:29.360 --> 22:33.280
I've not spoke to Holly tonight.
She's too busy flirting with Scott.

22:33.360 --> 22:37.280
I can see that Chloe is boiling.
Someone is about to fucking get it.

22:38.720 --> 22:43.160
I know I should keep my temper under
control, but it's so fucking hard.

22:46.480 --> 22:47.920
I have just been finished.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.520
And Chloe has the audacity
to come over to me

22:51.600 --> 22:53.800
and accuse me of flirting
with somebody

22:53.880 --> 22:55.920
who isn't even her fucking lad!

23:00.440 --> 23:03.200
I can't believe
Chloe's kicking off with Holly

23:03.280 --> 23:05.960
when it's Marnie who's been
all over him all night.

23:06.040 --> 23:08.640
I need to get this fucking lunatic
out of the way

23:08.720 --> 23:10.400
because she is a liability.

23:17.080 --> 23:20.240
What a surprise. The girls
are kicking off over us again.

23:20.320 --> 23:22.320
The amount of girls
fighting over me,

23:22.400 --> 23:25.440
I'll organise a Street Fighter
tournament. Round one.

23:25.520 --> 23:27.640
Fight. Hadouken.

23:32.920 --> 23:35.320
What the fuck is Chloe doing
shoving Holly?

23:35.400 --> 23:37.080
Where did that come from?

23:41.880 --> 23:45.600
I can understand when Chloe kicks off
when Scott pulls other girls.

23:45.680 --> 23:47.240
This is Holly, her mate.

23:51.560 --> 23:54.720
The girls are going berserk tonight.
I wonder what it is.

23:54.800 --> 23:56.800
Oh, wait, I know. It's me.

24:01.600 --> 24:05.120
I'm being made out to look like
a nutter. No-one even understands.

24:05.200 --> 24:08.320
I cannot be arsed with this shit.
I'm off, me.

24:08.400 --> 24:11.000
Once again,
Chloe's ruined it for everyone.

24:11.080 --> 24:13.320
I need to get everyone home.

24:13.400 --> 24:16.680
I can't believe it's all kicking off
on Nathan's gay day.

24:16.760 --> 24:20.080
It was meant to be sparkly
and full of rainbows and unicorns.

24:20.160 --> 24:22.960
Now it's full of hatred and hell.

24:27.280 --> 24:29.040
She came at me, right, listen.

24:29.120 --> 24:32.840
She came at me and she was like,
"You have been flirting with Scott!"

24:32.920 --> 24:35.520
I was like, "What?"
He's with Marnie right now.

24:35.600 --> 24:37.440
Like, are you fucking for real?

24:37.520 --> 24:41.160
The ironic thing is Scott and Marnie
are still all over each other.

24:41.240 --> 24:44.880
And... I've just been shoved.
What the hell has happened tonight?

24:49.480 --> 24:52.840
We're all smashed, starving
and fucking fuming at Chloe.

24:52.920 --> 24:54.040
No kick-offs, yeah?

24:54.120 --> 24:57.320
Can't believe I'm stuck in a taxi
with this lunatic again.

24:57.400 --> 25:00.920
She was there for me earlier on,
but she's ruined the day.

25:04.360 --> 25:07.960
Right. He is getting to your head.
You are letting him.

25:08.040 --> 25:11.080
You're taking it out on others.
It's not their problem.

25:11.160 --> 25:15.640
Nathan's never felt like this,
so it's hard. He doesn't understand.

25:16.840 --> 25:20.160
You're her best friend. And you
know how she feels about him.

25:20.240 --> 25:23.760
I even know, and I'm not even...
But she's fucking all over Aaron!

25:23.840 --> 25:25.840
Chloe's being a massive hypocrite.

25:25.920 --> 25:29.480
She spent all night flirting with
Aaron, then kicked off at Holly.

25:29.560 --> 25:31.080
She can't like him that much

25:31.160 --> 25:34.040
if she wants to make him jealous
by flirting with Aaron.

25:34.120 --> 25:35.320
Everyone's arguing.

25:35.400 --> 25:38.240
"He's flirting with her.
She's flirting with him."

25:38.320 --> 25:40.160
"He's a knob. She's kicking off."

25:40.240 --> 25:43.560
And I'm just sitting there thinking,
"I don't give a fuck."

25:43.640 --> 25:47.800
Every person knows how much
I have said I like Scott.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.400
I've told them all for days.

25:49.480 --> 25:51.440
I know Chloe really likes Scott.

25:51.520 --> 25:53.720
But it's just getting
out of hand now.

25:53.800 --> 25:56.520
I mean, I'm gonna be there for her,
no matter what.

25:56.600 --> 25:59.280
Even if it does annoy us,
she's my best friend.

25:59.360 --> 26:01.600
He's messing with my fucking head.

26:05.040 --> 26:07.040
Yous two were talking more.

26:07.120 --> 26:10.720
This is why I don't pull girls
in this villa. Look at the mess.

26:10.800 --> 26:13.160
They're like a bunch of squirrels
in a bin,

26:13.240 --> 26:15.160
fighting over a fucking pine cone.

26:22.600 --> 26:25.720
Holly is newly single.
And she's been with Scott before.

26:25.800 --> 26:29.000
It would be easy for her to go
back there. That's why it hurts.

26:29.080 --> 26:31.360
Scott, you need to
fucking shut it down.

26:31.440 --> 26:34.960
All boils down to the fact that
Scott still hasn't had the bottle

26:35.040 --> 26:37.760
to tell Chloe that
nothing's ever gonna happen.

26:39.960 --> 26:42.600
You know what it is?
I have to go and speak to Chloe

26:42.680 --> 26:46.480
and calm her down because this
whole thing is just ridiculous now.

26:46.560 --> 26:48.960
You know what I'm like.
I'm gonna pull girls.

26:49.040 --> 26:51.600
With Marnie and Holly,
I've always had that.

26:51.680 --> 26:54.440
I'm not gonna get with them,
but I am gonna flirt.

26:54.520 --> 26:57.840
Scott just admitted it.
He does flirt with Holly and Marnie.

26:57.920 --> 26:59.360
Stop it. I don't like it.

26:59.440 --> 27:02.080
You know how I feel.
You were in front of my face.

27:02.160 --> 27:05.360
To be fair, I was actually
spending more time with Marnie.

27:05.440 --> 27:07.960
Yeah, but you weren't
with Marnie in that way.

27:08.040 --> 27:11.080
It was actually more Marnie
that way. No, you weren't.

27:11.160 --> 27:14.920
Chloe, you kick off with Holly,
but did you even see me and Marnie?

27:15.000 --> 27:17.120
If you want to kick off,
kick off at her,

27:17.200 --> 27:18.920
because it was ten times worse.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.080
She was on me lips
like fucking Carmex.

27:21.160 --> 27:25.040
You've got no respect for me.
Listen. Give us a cuddle.

27:26.880 --> 27:28.480
Aww, so affectionate.

27:28.560 --> 27:31.240
Yeah. Right. Chloe.
See you in a bit.

27:31.320 --> 27:35.040
Chloe, it's fucking obvious that
nowt's gonna happen between wer,

27:35.120 --> 27:38.200
but I'm not telling you nowt
tonight. So I'm off to kip.

27:38.280 --> 27:41.960
Tonight has been a disaster.
I've ruined my best friend's night,

27:42.040 --> 27:45.840
the boy I like is flirting with my
friend and no-one's speaking to us.

27:45.920 --> 27:49.120
Minus Chloe's tantrum,
today has been the perfect day

27:49.200 --> 27:51.920
and I didn't want it to end.
But it's time to go bed.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.200
And I can wake up tomorrow
a new gay me.

28:10.520 --> 28:12.520
My head hurts.
How was your day?

28:12.600 --> 28:13.880
Yeah, how was it?

28:13.960 --> 28:16.880
Do you know what, like,
the highlight of my night was?

28:16.960 --> 28:21.000
When the boys came downstairs with
all that writing on their chests.

28:21.080 --> 28:22.080
That was so nice.

28:22.160 --> 28:24.440
Yeah, that was lovely.
I loved that.

28:24.520 --> 28:28.360
Today is actually the first day that
I've woke up in the villa a gay man.

28:28.440 --> 28:30.000
And I'm fucking proud.

28:30.080 --> 28:32.160
I'm so sorry for ruining your night.

28:32.240 --> 28:34.800
Do you know what?
You didn't ruin my night.

28:34.880 --> 28:37.400
Nathan always knows
what to say to cheer us up.

28:37.480 --> 28:40.280
But I know I ruined gay day
and I feel terrible.

28:40.360 --> 28:42.600
Scott and Holly were
all over each other.

28:42.680 --> 28:45.880
He's apparently doing it to
cheer her up, but I know he's not.

28:45.960 --> 28:49.400
I feel bad for pushing Holly.
But I feel like she pushes into it.

28:49.480 --> 28:51.240
She knows how much I like Scott.

28:53.000 --> 28:56.880
Is Chloe having a laugh?

28:56.960 --> 29:00.480
Last night was ridiculous. I got
shoved for doing nothing wrong.

29:00.560 --> 29:04.000
Marnie got off scot-free.
Well, she wasn't exactly Scott free.

29:04.080 --> 29:06.280
In my part, it was 100% harmless.

29:06.360 --> 29:09.720
I just...
I was just a bit lonely, like.

29:09.800 --> 29:12.840
I can't understand why
I would act like that last night.

29:12.920 --> 29:16.360
I can only think it's because
I was missing Ricky's attention.

29:16.440 --> 29:19.080
So I looked at the next best thing,
Scott.

29:19.160 --> 29:22.200
Mate, they were all just,
like, literally on one, man.

29:22.280 --> 29:25.840
Last night all the girls
started fighting over me. Soz.

29:25.920 --> 29:29.560
I think it's the way she was...
Marnie was going on last night, man.

29:31.400 --> 29:33.920
...after getting a call
from her boyfriend?

29:34.000 --> 29:37.040
"Thanks, babe, love you.
Where's that cock?"(laughs)

29:37.120 --> 29:38.960
Fucking... I don't know.

29:39.040 --> 29:42.320
I thought Marnie was loved up.
Maybe Ricky's not the one.

29:42.920 --> 29:44.760
Morning. (coughs)

29:44.840 --> 29:46.000
Morning, yo.

29:46.080 --> 29:49.120
I love seeing Nathan happy.
I'm proper proud of the kid.

29:49.200 --> 29:52.640
He looks 100 times more comfortable
after yesterday.

29:52.720 --> 29:56.720
Actually, you made me a promise
last night and you broke it.Ah.

29:56.800 --> 30:01.280
What? You said to me if I don't
bring a boy back, you will spoon me.

30:01.360 --> 30:03.440
Howay, Nathan, don't you start.

30:03.520 --> 30:06.920
I've had the girls scrapping
over me. Don't you get involved.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.640
You need to honour your promise.
I'll spoon you.

30:09.720 --> 30:12.600
I'll kick off, like the girls do.

30:12.680 --> 30:14.520
We'll sort that out tonight.

30:14.600 --> 30:17.280
For that, we have to naked spoon.
No, we don't.

30:17.360 --> 30:19.320
Yeah, we do.
(laughs)

30:29.840 --> 30:31.400
Ooh, sexy.

30:32.200 --> 30:35.240
I feel a bit shit about
all the drama I caused last night.

30:35.320 --> 30:38.960
But I've got a wicked plan to get
everyone being my friends again.

30:40.120 --> 30:42.280
Oh, my God.

30:42.360 --> 30:46.760
Chloe comes out of the villa with a
small animal attached to her head.

30:46.840 --> 30:49.560
I've had a mint idea.
I was sitting thinking.

30:49.640 --> 30:52.200
We should do some
synchronised swimming.

30:52.280 --> 30:57.120
Eh? Synchronised swimming?
She can't even fucking swim.

30:57.200 --> 30:58.320
Who's up for it?
Me.

30:58.400 --> 31:00.760
Holly?
I'll watch and judge.

31:00.840 --> 31:04.600
Chloe still hasn't apologised.
No way I'll play happy families.

31:04.680 --> 31:06.600
Go on, I need cheering up today.

31:06.680 --> 31:10.120
Oh, my God. Charlotte.
You look like an old woman.

31:10.200 --> 31:11.280
(laughter)

31:11.360 --> 31:15.680
We've got blue condoms on our head.
Chloe, this better cheer you up.

31:15.760 --> 31:18.600
Lie on the floor,
like if you're lying in the pool.

31:18.680 --> 31:19.680
I have long legs.

31:19.760 --> 31:22.680
I'll give Zante the best
synchronised swimming ever.

31:22.760 --> 31:26.080
(all) One, two, three.
One, two, three.

31:26.160 --> 31:29.800
Gary is taking it so seriously.
Calm down, pet.

31:29.880 --> 31:31.080
Whoo!

31:31.160 --> 31:35.240
(laughs)
She's bald! She's bald!

31:36.080 --> 31:39.040
Fuck! My hair piece has just
come flying out.

31:39.120 --> 31:40.200
It was only £9.99.

31:40.280 --> 31:43.200
Doesn't matter about the price.
It's about dignity.

31:43.280 --> 31:45.000
(laughter)
Oh, fuck.

31:45.080 --> 31:46.960
Is that part of the routine, aye?

31:47.040 --> 31:49.040
We've been practicing all morning.

31:49.120 --> 31:52.840
It's time to stop fannying around
and to get this show on the road.

31:57.560 --> 31:59.200
And lovely, graceful.

31:59.280 --> 32:04.240
One leg. Two legs.
One second. And handstand.

32:04.320 --> 32:07.720
Synchronised swimming isn't
a sport I'm familiar with,

32:07.800 --> 32:10.240
but I'm sure you're
meant to be synchronised.

32:10.320 --> 32:12.280
One. Two. Three.

32:12.360 --> 32:14.120
Go.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.600
Once more.

32:15.680 --> 32:16.720
And finish.

32:18.680 --> 32:22.000
Thank you for participating,
you've been a great audience.

32:22.080 --> 32:24.480
Synchronised swim
was a complete success,

32:24.560 --> 32:26.160
but now I need to talk to Holly.

32:26.240 --> 32:28.680
I was out of order.
I need to apologise to her.

32:33.760 --> 32:36.320
Holly, can I have a word with you,
please? Yeah.

32:37.120 --> 32:38.720
Chloe's asked to speak to me.

32:38.800 --> 32:41.280
Better be an apology,
not another shoving.

32:41.360 --> 32:44.280
I really wanna apologise
for pushing you last night.

32:44.360 --> 32:47.600
I just... I was just so angry.
There will never, ever, ever,

32:47.680 --> 32:51.240
ever be anything between
me and Scott ever again.

32:51.320 --> 32:53.040
That is completely in the past.

32:53.120 --> 32:57.720
She knows that she was in the wrong
last night. I'm pleased about that.

32:57.800 --> 33:00.480
Don't worry about it. I forgive you.
(laughs)

33:00.560 --> 33:03.800
I'm so happy we had this chat.
Cos I was like, "Fuck's sake."

33:03.880 --> 33:08.000
Holly's being alreet about it all.
Hopefully the flirting will stop.

33:08.080 --> 33:09.880
But I'm not gonna hold my breath.

33:09.960 --> 33:13.280
Let's just get fucked tonight.
Let's get fucked. Yeah.

33:13.360 --> 33:15.400
And don't shove us this time.
(laughs)

33:23.080 --> 33:24.840
We've all had such a lovely day.

33:24.920 --> 33:30.440
But now it's time to get ready for a
night, where the real magic happens.

33:40.320 --> 33:43.880
Everyone is pumped for tonight.
It's time to hit up Zante.

33:43.960 --> 33:45.200
I wanna get pissed.

33:45.280 --> 33:49.200
The other night was fucking radge,
cos you... Seen you kissing Marnie.

33:49.280 --> 33:53.480
Then I seen you dancing with Holly.
Who do you think you are, mate?

33:53.560 --> 33:56.160
That's right, Gaz.
I was kissing a girl, mate.

33:56.240 --> 34:00.360
Remember what it was like when your
balls weren't in Lillie's clutch?

34:00.440 --> 34:02.920
Let's just fucking do this.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.800
So, have we got old Holly tonight?

34:04.880 --> 34:07.120
I think she'll be
definitely out tonight.

34:07.200 --> 34:09.720
Are you gonna be pulling?
Absolutely not, no.

34:09.800 --> 34:11.120
But I'll be having fun.

34:11.200 --> 34:13.400
I know that the girls are
trying to help,

34:13.480 --> 34:17.160
but the thought of kissing
another lad is making us feel sick.

34:17.240 --> 34:20.320
If I find a good-looking lad
I'll bring him back, shag him.

34:20.400 --> 34:22.480
Me and Marns can help if you want.
Yeah.

34:22.560 --> 34:25.360
Tonight is all about me pulling
another lad.

34:25.440 --> 34:27.440
And I just wanna ignore Scott.

34:27.520 --> 34:31.360
Don't let us down.
At least get fingered.

34:31.440 --> 34:33.240
Chloe's determined to pull.

34:33.320 --> 34:36.400
She can't shed any more tears
over Scott. It's not worth it.

34:36.480 --> 34:39.920
Do you know how fucking horny I am?
And sexually frustrated.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.840
My clit has been kicking off.

34:41.920 --> 34:45.360
If your clit's kicking off,
find it some balls to play with.

34:46.720 --> 34:48.320
Lads!
(screams)

34:48.400 --> 34:51.480
(all) Lads!

34:51.560 --> 34:52.880
(all scream)

34:52.960 --> 34:54.160
Cool it, yeah?
Howay.

34:54.240 --> 34:57.600
The whole squad and wicked dick
are in party mode tonight.

34:57.680 --> 35:00.640
So we're gonna hit Plus Club
and go fucking akka.

35:00.720 --> 35:02.960
(all cheering)

35:08.160 --> 35:10.840
We get to the club
and it's absolutely bouncing.

35:10.920 --> 35:13.960
And we've got a bird's-eye view.
This place is wicked.

35:15.600 --> 35:18.760
Let's have a fucking mint night!
(all cheering)

35:18.840 --> 35:20.840
Tonight, I really wanna get mortal,

35:20.920 --> 35:23.640
and this looks like
the perfect place to do it.

35:34.560 --> 35:38.440
Everyone's massively drunk.
I am feeling so horny.

35:48.520 --> 35:52.720
Holly, if you don't wanna shag
someone for yourself, do it for me.

35:52.800 --> 35:55.280
You're meant to be my best friend.

36:03.520 --> 36:07.240
Charlotte thinks the only way to
have fun is to jump on another cock.

36:07.320 --> 36:09.600
That's not how I work.
I can be fun by myself.

36:18.680 --> 36:20.920
What is the point
in even having a vagina?

36:21.000 --> 36:23.600
You are a disgrace to
all women in this world!

36:30.360 --> 36:34.080
Me and Chloe are looking over the
balcony for boys. And I find one.

36:34.160 --> 36:37.400
He comes in a vision of white,
like a ghost with a tanned face.

36:44.000 --> 36:47.360
# Bye-bye, bisexual Nathan

36:47.440 --> 36:50.720
# He's got a boy
And he's kissing him good

36:50.800 --> 36:54.480
# Is this boy
Gonna suck Nathan's wood? #

36:55.680 --> 36:56.680
Buzzing!

37:07.760 --> 37:11.800
The club is going off and I am
having an absolutely amazing time.

37:13.680 --> 37:16.480
For once, I wanted to
stay away from Scott tonight.

37:16.560 --> 37:19.800
But I can't. I'm absolutely mortal.
I'm blaming the booze.

37:19.880 --> 37:23.080
Poor Chloe is trying to
flirt with Scott once again.

37:23.160 --> 37:25.320
Why doesn't she just
fucking give up?

37:25.400 --> 37:27.840
Chloe keeps grabbing my knob.

37:27.920 --> 37:30.200
Chloe, man,
this isn't a petting zoo.

37:30.280 --> 37:32.480
Don't feed the animals
out of date food.

37:36.440 --> 37:38.720
Marnie's upset.
I wonder what's going on.

37:48.160 --> 37:50.200
I've never been in this situation,

37:50.280 --> 37:52.600
where I've missed someone
as much as this.

37:52.680 --> 37:56.400
Being in Greece has definitely
made us love him even more.

37:56.480 --> 38:00.120
Charlotte's had a good night.
But she went in too hard, too soon.

38:03.560 --> 38:05.640
I've noticed that
Scott hasn't pulled,

38:05.720 --> 38:08.320
and he did say if he doesn't pull
he'll spoon me,

38:08.400 --> 38:12.240
so I'm ditching this lad and
going home for a Scotty T embrace.

38:15.920 --> 38:19.880
(Charlotte) We're back at the villa.
I am fucking mortal.

38:19.960 --> 38:21.640
Aaron, take me to bed.

38:23.760 --> 38:27.400
Being away from my boyfriend got
too much for us. I'm off to bed.

38:27.480 --> 38:30.640
Tonight is the night
that me and you... spoon.

38:30.720 --> 38:32.080
He's big spoon, though.

38:32.160 --> 38:36.120
What? Scott is gonna spoon Nathan?
Scott doesn't even spoon me.

38:36.200 --> 38:38.640
I'm right behind you.
Enjoy it, boys.

38:38.720 --> 38:40.120
That's what I like to see.

38:40.200 --> 38:43.320
Fucking hell, the way everyone's
going on in this villa,

38:43.400 --> 38:45.720
I may as well shag Aaron and Gaz.

38:45.800 --> 38:48.640
You made a promise.
You've gotta honour that.

38:48.720 --> 38:52.560
Don't be nervous. It's just a spoon.
That could lead to a fork.

38:52.640 --> 38:56.320
The jealousy's got the better
of us. I have to stop this shit.

38:57.800 --> 39:00.640
Where are you going?
Leave the boys to themselves.

39:00.720 --> 39:05.920
Chloe is fucking fuming.
That girl is an absolute nut case.

39:08.680 --> 39:09.880
Right, firstly...

39:09.960 --> 39:12.280
Firstly,
you know how I feel about Scott.

39:12.360 --> 39:14.200
Agh!
You know how I feel about him.

39:14.280 --> 39:16.960
Do you really think
I have feelings for him?

39:17.040 --> 39:20.720
I know it's ridiculous, but I can't
help but be so angry and jealous.

39:20.800 --> 39:24.440
Do you really think
I fucking fancy him? No.

39:24.520 --> 39:26.680
It's a fucking joke, man,
a bit of fun.

39:26.760 --> 39:31.040
Scott made a bet and he lost. So now
he's gotta pay the price. Go away.

39:31.120 --> 39:33.320
...purposely to piss us off
all the time.

39:33.400 --> 39:36.000
(Gaz) I can understand
why Chloe is pissed off.

39:36.080 --> 39:40.640
Now Scott has even chose a lad
over getting with her.

39:40.720 --> 39:42.440
Now, that's a low blow.

39:46.200 --> 39:49.040
Chloe, while me and Nathan spoon,
if you want,

39:49.120 --> 39:51.960
you can be the place mat
on the other side of the room.

39:52.040 --> 39:53.840
Cock-block Chloe.

39:55.800 --> 40:01.280
Nathan, it's a good thing we've got
this fly net. Keep the pests out.

40:01.360 --> 40:03.960
I think it's safe to say
that no matter what I do,

40:04.040 --> 40:05.360
Chloe is gonna kick off.

40:05.440 --> 40:09.040
I'm only having a bit of friendly
banter and she's going berserk.

40:09.120 --> 40:10.960
She's like a constant nightmare.

40:12.640 --> 40:13.960
What the fuck?!

40:14.040 --> 40:16.160
Seeing Nathan and Scott
in bed together

40:16.240 --> 40:18.280
has made us more angry.
I wish it was me!

40:18.360 --> 40:21.720
You know how I feel about him!
Don't mention him.

40:21.800 --> 40:24.400
I was about to make an offer.
Now fuck your offer.

40:24.480 --> 40:27.360
I was about to invite you there
to spoon.

40:27.440 --> 40:29.960
But the fact that you just
kicked off, fuck off.

40:30.040 --> 40:33.280
I'm not a bag of fucking Minstrels
you can just pass about.

40:35.080 --> 40:36.520
Well, I don't.

40:37.680 --> 40:41.400
Chloe, I don't know how I feel
about you because you never tell me.

40:41.480 --> 40:44.240
I fancy... I love...
No, I don't love you.

40:44.320 --> 40:48.040
No, no, no. I do not love Scott.
I don't know why I said that!

40:48.120 --> 40:49.440
I do not love Scott!

40:49.520 --> 40:52.360
She's just said some random word
beginning with "l".

40:52.440 --> 40:54.040
I have no idea what it means.

40:54.120 --> 40:56.920
I've told Scott a million times
how much I like him.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.280
But he doesn't listen.

40:58.360 --> 41:01.000
Night-night.
Night-night, too.

41:01.080 --> 41:04.520
I do feel pretty bad because
I don't feel the same way about her.

41:04.600 --> 41:08.000
But wherever she goes from here,
I do wish her the best of luck.

41:08.080 --> 41:09.880
And a fucking happy new year.

41:09.960 --> 41:13.320
Are we actually spooning?
Howay, come on.

41:13.400 --> 41:15.800
I was joking, you know.
I wasn't. Come here.

41:16.920 --> 41:21.840
I need cuddles. Cuddles with Nath.
All right, give me this hand.

41:21.920 --> 41:23.680
Oh.

41:23.760 --> 41:26.440
Thank fuck for that.
Chloe has gone to bed.

41:26.520 --> 41:29.640
So tonight, Scott's mine.
Bye, bitch.

41:34.280 --> 41:34.480
.
