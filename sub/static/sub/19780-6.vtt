WEBVTT

00:04.321 --> 00:06.721
My destination is this way, as well.

00:06.723 --> 00:07.889
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:07.891 --> 00:10.292
Is it the Thai grocer
or the comic-book store?

00:10.294 --> 00:11.860
Well, yeah, it's the comics.

00:11.862 --> 00:13.795
- Right.
- That... that's hot, yeah?

00:14.798 --> 00:17.298
You know, I should have said Thai grocer.

00:17.300 --> 00:19.400
Then you would have thought
I was an excellent Thai chef.

00:19.402 --> 00:21.069
Yeah, but then we would have
gotten caught in a situation

00:21.071 --> 00:22.136
where we had to prove it.

00:22.138 --> 00:23.838
And I have you over for dinner one night,

00:23.840 --> 00:25.907
and then there's empty
Thai containers in the garbage

00:25.909 --> 00:28.242
and we're done before we've
even had a chance kind of thing?

00:28.244 --> 00:31.011
I'm sorry, uh, Charlie has Luke.

00:31.013 --> 00:32.980
Actually, it's my security system.

00:32.982 --> 00:33.981
Just a second.

00:33.983 --> 00:35.616
Hello?

00:35.618 --> 00:36.617
You're kidding.

00:36.619 --> 00:37.785
Okay, I'll be right there.

00:37.787 --> 00:39.320
The alarm in my apartment's going off,

00:39.322 --> 00:40.455
so I just need to...

00:40.457 --> 00:41.855
- I-I'll come with you. Yeah.
- Okay.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:51.533 --> 00:53.400
- Forget to close it?
- I'm a surgeon.

00:53.402 --> 00:55.168
I don't forget to close things.

00:55.170 --> 00:56.670
There used to be
a really gaudy statue there.

00:56.672 --> 00:58.672
It's gone.

00:58.674 --> 00:59.840
Hello?

00:59.842 --> 01:00.841
Oh, thank God.

01:00.843 --> 01:03.042
That thing could wake the dead.

01:03.044 --> 01:05.278
Mom.

01:05.280 --> 01:08.281
Oh, I have been meaning
to come and help pitch in

01:08.283 --> 01:11.318
ever since you told me
that you and Charlie split.

01:11.320 --> 01:13.286
A-And I'm gonna need the alarm code.

01:13.288 --> 01:14.687
Wait, what are you doing?

01:14.689 --> 01:15.755
Well, I-I thought

01:15.757 --> 01:17.824
that everything that belongs to Charlie

01:17.826 --> 01:19.358
could just go in those boxes.

01:19.360 --> 01:20.359
Why?

01:20.361 --> 01:23.129
Because the place is a man cave.

01:23.131 --> 01:25.364
We need to get it looking like Alex again.

01:25.366 --> 01:28.034
- Mm-hmm.
- Where's Luke?

01:28.036 --> 01:29.535
Uh, he is with Charlie.

01:29.537 --> 01:31.638
Oh, and, uh, Mom, this is Emmanuel.

01:31.640 --> 01:33.606
Emmanuel, this is my mom, Martha.

01:33.608 --> 01:35.307
Lovely to meet you, Martha.

01:35.309 --> 01:38.477
Well, look at you...
already back up on that horse.

01:39.614 --> 01:41.880
- The apple doesn't fall far.
- Mother.

01:41.882 --> 01:42.881
I should go.

01:42.883 --> 01:44.116
Oh, no, no. This can work out.

01:44.118 --> 01:45.751
Look, I'll just go and crash in the bedroom

01:45.753 --> 01:47.620
while you two heat up,
and then when you're ready,

01:47.622 --> 01:49.488
I'll just come out here
and scooch onto the couch.

01:49.490 --> 01:50.523
Oh, my God, Mom.

01:50.525 --> 01:52.758
Stop. Please, please, I beg you.

01:52.760 --> 01:54.159
Okay, I am so sorry.

01:54.161 --> 01:55.326
Um... tomorrow.

01:55.328 --> 01:56.895
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

01:56.897 --> 01:57.896
- Okay?
- Yeah.

01:57.898 --> 01:59.430
I'm sorry.

01:59.432 --> 02:00.999
It's okay.

02:15.114 --> 02:17.114
Are you cooking?

02:17.116 --> 02:19.950
I wish Luke was here.

02:19.952 --> 02:22.119
He needs to taste my special pancakes.

02:22.121 --> 02:24.955
You may blossom
in grandmotherhood after all.

02:24.957 --> 02:26.223
Oh, come on.

02:26.225 --> 02:28.425
I made pancakes for you kids.

02:28.427 --> 02:29.727
Only if you were still up,

02:29.729 --> 02:31.729
and then I had to listen
to drunk life advice

02:31.731 --> 02:33.597
from all of your unemployed poet friends.

02:33.599 --> 02:36.533
Did you know that most of those
guys are almost all dead now?

02:36.535 --> 02:40.137
Well, you come in like a hurricane.

02:40.139 --> 02:42.772
Yes, well... but it'll be worth it.

02:42.774 --> 02:45.775
When I turn this place into
the palace that I never gave you

02:45.777 --> 02:47.377
when you were a little girl.

02:47.379 --> 02:49.680
Okay, listen,
I know what you're trying to do,

02:49.682 --> 02:52.048
but we haven't really
seen each other in years.

02:52.050 --> 02:53.750
But we said
that's gonna change, right?

02:54.786 --> 02:56.786
I've never been the palace type.

02:56.788 --> 02:58.621
No, you're not.

02:58.623 --> 03:00.990
You're my brilliant surgeon daughter.

03:00.992 --> 03:03.593
You got that way without any help from me.

03:03.595 --> 03:05.261
So let me take some of the pressure off.

03:05.263 --> 03:06.329
Now.

03:06.331 --> 03:07.764
Let me look after my grandson.

03:07.766 --> 03:09.966
Just while you're going through
this breakup thing.

03:09.968 --> 03:11.768
Luke's in day care at the hospital.

03:11.770 --> 03:13.036
Not today, he isn't.

03:13.038 --> 03:15.504
Today, he's got adventures with Grandma.

03:15.506 --> 03:17.607
Are you sure you're okay, Mom?

03:17.609 --> 03:20.443
I'm clean and serene.

03:20.445 --> 03:23.779
Just celebrated two years.

03:23.781 --> 03:26.115
You still going to meetings?

03:26.117 --> 03:28.817
Like a girl scout.

03:28.819 --> 03:31.586
I don't know.

03:31.588 --> 03:33.588
Alex, honey. I got this.

03:35.359 --> 03:37.525
Eat a pancake.

03:41.799 --> 03:43.932
Cassie, you busy girl.

03:43.934 --> 03:45.467
Your name's been on half my surgeries.

03:45.469 --> 03:47.502
I worked my ass off to earn
every one of those cases.

03:47.504 --> 03:49.471
I'm sure you have.

03:49.473 --> 03:50.805
Oh.

03:50.807 --> 03:53.074
I mean, thank you, Dr. Harris.

03:53.076 --> 03:55.810
I hope things are going well with you.

03:55.812 --> 03:56.978
Mm.

03:56.980 --> 03:59.614
Hey.

03:59.616 --> 04:01.316
Maybe not.

04:02.352 --> 04:04.318
- Hi.
- Hey.

04:04.320 --> 04:07.221
Cassie, we've got a consult in the ER.
You want to meet me there?

04:07.223 --> 04:08.956
Yeah. Got it.

04:10.994 --> 04:13.427
Actually, I don't think
I need another coffee.

04:13.429 --> 04:15.129
Okay. I'll see you on rounds.

04:17.100 --> 04:18.132
Hi.

04:18.134 --> 04:19.433
Um...

04:19.435 --> 04:22.269
my mom's in town.

04:22.271 --> 04:24.505
She's gonna take Luke for a few hours today.

04:24.507 --> 04:26.340
- He's in day care.
- I signed him out.

04:26.342 --> 04:28.008
You sure that's a good idea?

04:28.010 --> 04:29.643
I'm trying to let her back in.

04:33.248 --> 04:35.683
Hi. How are you?

04:35.685 --> 04:37.818
Swimming in surgeries.

04:37.820 --> 04:40.020
Don't get me wrong, I love it.

04:40.022 --> 04:41.487
You didn't have anything to do
with these, did you?

04:42.524 --> 04:45.192
Are you working with Dr. Harris today?

04:46.728 --> 04:47.894
I am. Why?

04:47.896 --> 04:50.063
Well, I need to appoint an Interim Chief.

04:50.065 --> 04:52.999
Dr. Harris ran a tight ship
before his accident.

04:53.001 --> 04:54.634
Have you heard why he didn't
reclaim his position

04:54.636 --> 04:55.802
after he recovered?

04:55.804 --> 04:56.803
No.

04:56.805 --> 04:58.504
And I can't report on people for you.

04:58.506 --> 05:01.541
Do you want to be liked,
or do you want to be respected?

05:01.543 --> 05:04.344
Hmm, I'll take both, please.

05:05.447 --> 05:07.146
You know, Cassie,
you're on the fast track

05:07.148 --> 05:08.781
to being named Chief Resident.

05:08.783 --> 05:10.883
Oh. That's good.

05:10.885 --> 05:12.484
And some jobs
require making hard choices

05:12.486 --> 05:14.353
and saying things
that people don't want to hear.

05:14.355 --> 05:17.022
You mean like your decision
to shut down the ER

05:17.024 --> 05:19.458
and remove Dr. Bell from Chief of Surgery?

05:19.460 --> 05:21.393
A hospital isn't a place for someone

05:21.395 --> 05:24.163
who can't separate the personal
from the professional.

05:25.799 --> 05:27.799
So. Dr. Harris.

05:27.801 --> 05:30.134
Is he my new Chief?

05:30.136 --> 05:32.871
He's definitely unorthodox.

05:34.908 --> 05:37.275
Like, um... Jackson Pollock.

05:37.277 --> 05:39.978
A-A surgeon who's like Jackson Pollock?

05:39.980 --> 05:41.145
Say more things.

05:41.147 --> 05:44.535
Uh, unconventional but brilliant.

05:44.535 --> 05:45.645
Without all the splatter.

05:45.645 --> 05:46.649
I got to go.

05:49.622 --> 05:50.955
Morning.

05:50.957 --> 05:52.823
Sleeping with the enemy?

05:54.294 --> 05:58.129
You were the one who wanted to
keep things casual between us.

05:58.131 --> 05:59.830
You think I'm jealous?

05:59.832 --> 06:02.466
Your new boyfriend
is shutting down the ER today.

06:02.468 --> 06:04.602
He's not my boyfriend, and he's making

06:04.604 --> 06:07.304
an unemotional decision
that benefits the hospital.

06:07.306 --> 06:09.239
This was the best Level 1
trauma center in the city.

06:09.241 --> 06:10.240
That's why I came here.

06:10.242 --> 06:11.909
That's why you came here.

06:13.279 --> 06:14.445
After today, we're only
doing electives, so congrats.

06:14.447 --> 06:15.579
All your cozying up

06:15.581 --> 06:18.348
will make you
Chief Resident of Tummy Tucks.

06:18.350 --> 06:20.083
I'm not jealous, Cassie.

06:20.085 --> 06:21.651
I'm pissed off.

06:21.653 --> 06:22.819
And you're feeling better,

06:22.821 --> 06:24.955
which is a good indication
the drug is working.

06:24.957 --> 06:26.924
I walked all the way to the hospital today.

06:26.926 --> 06:28.325
That's a very good sign.

06:28.327 --> 06:30.427
Kelly Clarkson blaring in my iPod.

06:30.429 --> 06:32.195
Which is a less good sign...

06:32.197 --> 06:34.363
of your questionable taste in music.

06:35.667 --> 06:38.267
I never thought walking would be
the marker for a good day.

06:38.269 --> 06:40.670
- Baby steps to a full recovery.
- You think so?

06:40.672 --> 06:42.271
Let's just say I'm optimistic

06:42.273 --> 06:44.106
that we're gonna see great results today.

06:44.108 --> 06:46.242
From your lips to God's ears.

06:47.278 --> 06:48.711
Although, if I get those good results,

06:48.713 --> 06:50.279
I don't know
who I'm gonna share 'em with.

06:50.281 --> 06:51.513
What do you mean?

06:51.515 --> 06:52.714
Well...

06:52.716 --> 06:56.185
my parents pretty much
abandoned me when I came out.

06:56.187 --> 06:58.020
Violet's gone.

06:58.022 --> 06:59.621
You know, some of the women in the study...

06:59.623 --> 07:02.325
they've got really little kids.

07:02.327 --> 07:06.061
Sometimes I get this feeling
that it's like...

07:06.063 --> 07:07.563
more important that they live

07:07.565 --> 07:09.397
because it actually matters
to someone else if they do.

07:09.399 --> 07:10.632
Mnh-mnh.

07:10.634 --> 07:14.102
All that matters is that you all live.

07:14.104 --> 07:16.338
And you matter to me.

07:25.415 --> 07:26.448
Wow.

07:26.450 --> 07:28.549
They are really taking apart your ER.

07:28.551 --> 07:29.717
I'm tentatively positive.

07:29.719 --> 07:31.052
I can't afford not to be.

07:31.054 --> 07:32.653
Still paying spousal support, huh?

07:32.655 --> 07:34.655
Two mortgages. Tutors. Rep Hockey.

07:34.657 --> 07:36.124
- Then long live Urgent Care.
- Uh-huh.

07:36.126 --> 07:37.558
Where's Dawn? I haven't seen her today.

07:37.560 --> 07:38.893
Oh.

07:38.895 --> 07:41.295
After she was unceremoniously
relieved of Chief of Surgery,

07:41.297 --> 07:42.930
she decided that she needed a spa day,

07:42.932 --> 07:44.799
but when she called...

07:44.801 --> 07:46.934
I heard slot machines.

07:46.936 --> 07:47.935
Ooh.

07:47.937 --> 07:50.037
So. Here's the deal today, guys.

07:50.039 --> 07:52.540
We will be rerouting ambulances
to Mississauga Memorial

07:52.542 --> 07:56.110
and we will be a walk-in until
we close the doors tonight.

07:56.112 --> 07:57.611
Awesome.

07:57.613 --> 07:58.912
So, here you go.

07:58.914 --> 07:59.913
Bed number 4.

07:59.915 --> 08:01.915
Guy broke his "punny bone."

08:01.917 --> 08:04.284
Seriously, he's nonstop hilarity.

08:04.286 --> 08:06.053
I can't wait.

08:10.393 --> 08:11.691
Knock, knock.

08:11.693 --> 08:12.893
Who's there?

08:12.895 --> 08:14.895
- Orange.
- Orange who?

08:14.897 --> 08:17.697
Orange you glad you didn't see...

08:17.699 --> 08:20.366
banana?

08:23.935 --> 08:28.241
I don't want to jinx the study,
but I haven't felt this good

08:28.243 --> 08:30.343
since those creepy little cancer zombies

08:30.345 --> 08:31.777
took over my lymph nodes.

08:31.779 --> 08:33.046
And you've had an increase in appetite?

08:33.048 --> 08:34.414
I had a whole glass of champagne

08:34.416 --> 08:36.282
- at my mom's birthday party last night.
- Mmm.

08:36.284 --> 08:37.716
My, that is a good sign.

08:37.717 --> 08:39.751
I worry about who got a placebo.

08:39.754 --> 08:41.287
Like, what if it's me?

08:41.289 --> 08:42.888
But there is no placebo.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.290
It's a Phase 1/2 trial.

08:44.292 --> 08:46.091
Just cheer up, grumpy pants.

08:46.093 --> 08:47.192
She's right.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.361
We want to figure out
if the drug works, okay?

08:49.363 --> 08:50.896
So you all got the good stuff.

08:51.933 --> 08:55.167
Uh, anybody else increase in appetite?

08:55.169 --> 08:58.671
Well... I was waiting until you left

08:58.673 --> 09:01.406
to break these babies out!

09:01.408 --> 09:02.407
Oh!

09:02.409 --> 09:03.608
Those are terrible for you.

09:03.610 --> 09:05.077
Yeah, I'd be thrilled to live long enough

09:05.079 --> 09:06.178
for cheddar puffs to kill me.

09:06.180 --> 09:07.612
Well, I'm sharing.

09:07.614 --> 09:09.714
Well, then I will share four
seasons of "The Bachelorette."

09:09.716 --> 09:10.748
- Yeah!
- Yes!

09:10.750 --> 09:13.051
Ooh, okay. I better get going.

09:13.053 --> 09:16.788
Otherwise, I'm gonna get
sucked in and miss my surgery.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.322
- Hey, Dr. Lin.
- Yeah?

09:18.324 --> 09:20.224
I just wanted to say...

09:20.226 --> 09:22.093
you guys are the best.

09:22.095 --> 09:25.396
When you're diagnosed
with the big effin' "C,"

09:25.398 --> 09:26.931
you have this team behind you

09:26.933 --> 09:29.266
who's all,
"We're gonna beat this."

09:29.268 --> 09:31.970
You're the only one left still swinging.

09:36.842 --> 09:38.175
True dat, Doc.

09:38.177 --> 09:42.179
You are a bit of superhero.

09:44.217 --> 09:46.450
Hello, ladies.

09:46.452 --> 09:48.519
Oh. The other half of the dynamic duo.

09:48.521 --> 09:50.654
If you'll just excuse us for a moment.

09:50.656 --> 09:52.089
Dr. Lin, I need to talk to you.

09:52.091 --> 09:53.090
Okay.

09:53.092 --> 09:54.992
Not too many cheddar puffs, girls.

09:54.994 --> 09:56.226
- Get them.
- Okay.

09:56.228 --> 09:58.862
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.

09:59.898 --> 10:02.599
Stop!

10:02.601 --> 10:04.101
The suspense is killing me.

10:04.103 --> 10:05.468
Okay.

10:05.470 --> 10:06.937
Right.

10:06.939 --> 10:09.105
Here we go.

10:09.107 --> 10:11.141
All right.

10:12.577 --> 10:13.676
Uh...

10:13.678 --> 10:16.812
Spots on Laura's lungs are getting smaller.

10:18.283 --> 10:20.450
Maria's are shrinking.

10:20.452 --> 10:22.952
- Okay.
- This is hopeful.

10:22.954 --> 10:25.054
Shrinking, shrinking.

10:27.025 --> 10:28.290
Bree.

10:28.292 --> 10:31.127
Bree's spots are growing.

10:31.129 --> 10:34.030
Early days, though, right?

10:34.032 --> 10:35.831
Yeah.

10:42.060 --> 10:43.895
This is your first scan.

10:43.897 --> 10:46.663
If you look at the diameter of
the same spots in your new scan,

10:46.665 --> 10:48.266
most of them are the same.

10:48.268 --> 10:50.734
However, some of them have grown,

10:50.736 --> 10:52.169
like this one here.

10:52.171 --> 10:55.039
But most are stable, and stable is good.

10:55.041 --> 10:58.209
But there has been some growth.

10:58.211 --> 11:01.803
So I'm not responding to the study drug?

11:01.803 --> 11:03.939
- Not yet. But...
- Are any of the other girls?

11:03.939 --> 11:04.692
I'm sorry, Bree.

11:04.692 --> 11:06.424
We can't divulge that information.

11:10.202 --> 11:11.816
It's okay. It's fine.

11:11.816 --> 11:13.323
I can tell they are.

11:18.218 --> 11:20.032
I'm really sorry for this pity party.

11:20.032 --> 11:22.065
I'm really excited for everybody else.

11:22.770 --> 11:24.134
No, you have every right.

11:24.136 --> 11:27.804
You've been on a crazy ride
between the car accident

11:27.806 --> 11:29.272
and the clot and...

11:29.274 --> 11:31.374
Chemo to Violet leaving. Yeah, it's...

11:31.376 --> 11:33.008
It's pretty much all sucked.

11:33.010 --> 11:34.444
Well, I'm not giving up.

11:34.446 --> 11:36.746
I'm confident
that we are gonna get results,

11:36.748 --> 11:40.716
and when we do, Kelly Clarkson
tickets are on me.

11:40.718 --> 11:45.254
You are my kickass guardian angel.

11:46.825 --> 11:48.424
- Oh, my God.
- Bree!

11:48.426 --> 11:49.425
Bree.

11:49.427 --> 11:50.725
Okay, Bree, honey. What's wrong?

11:50.727 --> 11:52.727
Can you tell us where it hurts?

11:54.264 --> 11:55.296
Okay.

11:55.298 --> 11:57.231
What are we dealing with here, exactly?

11:57.233 --> 11:59.701
He took his clothes off in the lock-up.

11:59.703 --> 12:01.035
It freaked out a couple of drunk morons,

12:01.037 --> 12:02.571
and they roughed him up.

12:02.573 --> 12:04.005
Yeah, you put your tooth through your lip.

12:04.007 --> 12:06.374
Gonna need a couple stitches.
How's your head, sir?

12:06.376 --> 12:07.575
Head's right as rain.

12:07.577 --> 12:08.609
What's your name?

12:08.611 --> 12:10.278
They call me The Nude Dude.

12:10.280 --> 12:12.146
He calls himself The Nude Dude.

12:12.148 --> 12:13.481
- No ID?
- No pockets.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.383
He's exercising his right to be naked.

12:15.385 --> 12:17.385
- Which he doesn't have.
- Which is fascist.

12:17.387 --> 12:19.220
Hangs out with us a lot as a result.

12:19.222 --> 12:21.055
We dressed him to get him over here.

12:21.057 --> 12:22.490
Cuffed him.

12:22.492 --> 12:24.625
Somehow he got the damn jumpsuit
off in the back of the squad.

12:24.627 --> 12:26.794
Okay. Can we take the cuffs off?
I don't think he's very dangerous.

12:28.831 --> 12:31.665
Sir, I'm gonna ask you
to put on a gown for me.

12:31.667 --> 12:33.233
Nah, I'm good, thanks.

12:33.235 --> 12:34.835
I'm gonna ask you
to put a gown on me for me, sir.

12:34.837 --> 12:37.104
There are a lot of elderly
around here with weak hearts.

12:37.106 --> 12:39.906
It's sad that we live in a world
where nudity is shocking.

12:39.908 --> 12:44.311
But I appreciate you getting my cuffs off.

12:44.313 --> 12:46.480
You have compassion,

12:46.482 --> 12:48.915
the most important quality
in a revolutionary.

12:48.917 --> 12:49.949
Thanks.

12:49.951 --> 12:53.020
For you, I'll don the gown.

12:53.022 --> 12:54.354
- Hyuh!
- Great.

12:54.356 --> 12:55.855
Hey. Dr. Hamza.

12:55.857 --> 12:57.123
Yes. You paged me.

12:57.125 --> 12:59.859
We have a toddler with a nasty
bruise on his head, Bed 1.

12:59.861 --> 13:02.762
Thought I'd take the extra
precaution just to be sure.

13:03.865 --> 13:05.865
- Luke?
- Oh, no.

13:05.867 --> 13:07.500
You know him?

13:07.502 --> 13:08.801
Know him? I'm his godfather.

13:08.803 --> 13:11.504
Oh. I'm his grandmother.

13:11.506 --> 13:13.372
- You're Alex's...
- Please.

13:13.374 --> 13:15.441
You can't tell her that I'm here.

13:19.480 --> 13:21.813
How do you like working days?

13:21.815 --> 13:23.782
I'm still trying to flip my schedule.

13:23.784 --> 13:25.717
I got pretty used to working nights.

13:25.719 --> 13:27.719
Some of my favorite animals are nocturnal.

13:27.721 --> 13:30.121
Like rats?

13:30.123 --> 13:32.891
- Owls.
- Owls.

13:32.893 --> 13:34.893
Yeah. Big eyes, quiet wisdom.

13:34.895 --> 13:35.994
That's my type.

13:37.531 --> 13:39.798
You got to stop trying
to distract me, Dr. Reid.

13:39.800 --> 13:41.466
- I'm on my rounds.
- Okay.

13:42.502 --> 13:45.270
I would let you distract me
at a more appropriate time.

13:45.272 --> 13:46.737
Oh, you would, would you?

13:46.739 --> 13:47.838
I would. Yeah.

13:47.840 --> 13:49.474
I'd whip up some Pad Thai.

13:49.476 --> 13:51.242
You know, in the after owls.

13:51.244 --> 13:52.377
In the after hours.

13:52.379 --> 13:53.945
I'll think about it.

13:59.652 --> 14:01.285
Uh, Peter Stone?

14:01.287 --> 14:02.352
Hey, Doc.

14:02.354 --> 14:04.722
Uh, what do you call a mean pickle?

14:04.724 --> 14:06.757
Uh, I don't know. A sour dill.

14:06.759 --> 14:08.926
No. A prickle!

14:08.928 --> 14:10.828
Amazing.

14:10.830 --> 14:12.597
A sour dill was good, too.

14:12.599 --> 14:14.832
But I-I wouldn't quit your day job.

14:14.834 --> 14:17.934
At least not until you've, uh,
you've fix this wing.

14:17.936 --> 14:19.470
Yeah, what exactly happened?

14:19.472 --> 14:20.604
I was mixing a margarita.

14:20.606 --> 14:22.272
The good news is, I didn't spill a drop.

14:23.275 --> 14:25.242
He's been given morphine.

14:25.244 --> 14:27.277
Well, it looks like
you've shattered your humerus.

14:27.279 --> 14:28.945
I'm gonna, uh, need imaging to confirm,

14:28.947 --> 14:30.614
but you're probably gonna need surgery.

14:30.616 --> 14:33.217
Well, then, we'll both have
each other in stitches.

14:35.787 --> 14:38.888
Bree has a significant
small bowel obstruction.

14:38.890 --> 14:41.190
That's common
with metastatic breast cancer.

14:41.192 --> 14:42.525
What time
was her last blood thinner?

14:43.561 --> 14:44.828
10 hours ago,

14:44.830 --> 14:47.563
so she's due for another one soon.

14:47.565 --> 14:48.564
Good.

14:48.566 --> 14:50.000
Let's hold off on her next dose.

14:50.002 --> 14:52.101
We'll do the surgery,
fix the bowel before it tears.

14:52.103 --> 14:54.137
Oh, I don't think surgery's
our best option here.

14:54.139 --> 14:56.372
Why do you say that?

14:56.374 --> 14:57.773
Well, she's a very sick,

14:57.775 --> 15:00.176
immunocompromised Stage 4 cancer patient

15:00.178 --> 15:02.011
with a high risk
for a blood clot reoccurrence.

15:02.013 --> 15:03.779
I just don't think she can handle surgery.

15:03.781 --> 15:05.948
Is this because you think
surgery makes her ineligible

15:05.950 --> 15:07.482
to stay in the breast-cancer study?

15:07.484 --> 15:11.286
Surgery is just one option to
deal with a bowel obstruction.

15:11.288 --> 15:12.888
You want to suck out
the contents with an NG tube.

15:12.890 --> 15:14.957
Yep. It's a partial obstruction.

15:14.959 --> 15:16.792
NG tubes are slow,
and if the bowel perforates,

15:16.794 --> 15:18.493
then everything's gonna spill into her body

15:18.495 --> 15:20.362
and we'll be dealing
with sepsis on top of that.

15:20.364 --> 15:21.630
Maggie. She's your patient.

15:21.632 --> 15:23.098
I respect your opinion on this...

15:23.100 --> 15:24.132
Great. If that's true, then let's...

15:24.134 --> 15:25.833
We need to bring in the Chief of Surgery.

15:25.835 --> 15:28.370
Mr. Leffering.

15:29.406 --> 15:31.306
We're at a bit of a stalemate here.

15:31.308 --> 15:33.508
Have you appointed a new Chief of Surgery?

15:33.510 --> 15:35.644
Uh, yes.

15:35.646 --> 15:37.646
I have.

15:37.648 --> 15:39.181
Who is it?

15:39.183 --> 15:40.214
Dr. Harris.

15:42.686 --> 15:44.618
Dr. Harris.

15:44.620 --> 15:46.253
I'll be out in a minute.

15:46.255 --> 15:47.955
Let's multitask, Charlie.

15:47.957 --> 15:50.257
I'm naming you the new Interim Chief.

15:50.259 --> 15:52.827
Say what?

15:52.829 --> 15:53.928
Effective immediately.

15:53.930 --> 15:56.164
Yeah, thanks, but no thanks.

15:56.166 --> 15:58.098
I'm, uh... Been down that road before.

15:58.100 --> 15:59.600
Well, according to my data,

15:59.602 --> 16:02.002
you were the best Chief
this hospital's ever had.

16:02.004 --> 16:04.505
Look, Dr. Reid's cancer trial
has a pressing issue,

16:04.507 --> 16:06.173
and I'm not qualified
to make a decision on it.

16:06.175 --> 16:07.974
Yeah, well, neither am I. I'm a bone guy.

16:07.976 --> 16:09.543
You're the former Chief of Surgery

16:09.545 --> 16:11.512
with a track record
of making sound decisions

16:11.514 --> 16:14.514
for the patients of this hospital.

16:14.516 --> 16:16.817
Yeah, don't be modest, Charlie.

16:16.819 --> 16:19.352
This place needs a leader like you.

16:19.354 --> 16:21.922
Okay?

16:21.924 --> 16:25.058
What...

16:27.662 --> 16:29.729
Charlie.

16:31.533 --> 16:34.467
- So, you're the new Interim Chief?
- Uh, no.

16:34.469 --> 16:36.902
I was just ambushed.
I haven't accepted anything.

16:36.904 --> 16:39.239
Well, we need another
medical opinion on this.

16:39.241 --> 16:41.874
We have a very sick patient
with a bowel obstruction.

16:41.876 --> 16:44.043
I think it needs
to be tackled surgically.

16:44.045 --> 16:45.378
And I think we should hold off.

16:45.380 --> 16:47.046
This patient
is in our clinical trial,

16:47.048 --> 16:49.215
and the study rules state that major surgery

16:49.217 --> 16:51.851
will make her ineligible
to keep taking the trial drug.

16:51.853 --> 16:53.085
A drug that could save her life.

16:53.087 --> 16:56.222
The results have been questionable.

16:56.224 --> 16:58.290
Okay, well, if it was me,
I'd think long-term,

16:58.292 --> 17:00.525
give the patient some time
to respond to the drug.

17:00.527 --> 17:04.695
I'm siding with Maggie.

17:12.998 --> 17:14.273
This is the wrong call, Charlie.

17:14.273 --> 17:15.397
We could lose this patient unnecessarily.

17:15.400 --> 17:17.233
Yes, but otherwise,
you're taking a very sick woman

17:17.234 --> 17:19.368
away from a drug trial that
could potentially save her life.

17:19.371 --> 17:21.104
Maggie's too personally involved
to see this clearly.

17:21.106 --> 17:22.805
Bree's not responding well
to the study drug.

17:22.807 --> 17:24.406
Can she even handle going under the knife?

17:24.409 --> 17:26.576
I believe sepsis will kill her.

17:26.578 --> 17:28.744
Alex, ultimately, you can do what you want.

17:28.746 --> 17:29.779
You're the surgeon.

17:31.383 --> 17:32.415
Charlie.

17:32.417 --> 17:35.051
Is this about something else?

17:35.053 --> 17:37.787
Do you think this is personal?

17:37.789 --> 17:39.121
Is it?

17:39.123 --> 17:41.156
Alex, you asked me for my medical opinion,

17:41.158 --> 17:42.324
and I gave it.

17:43.962 --> 17:47.029
If you'll excuse me,
I've got an elbow to fix.

17:54.638 --> 17:56.571
Okay, well,
he didn't lose consciousness.

17:56.573 --> 17:57.572
That's good.

17:57.574 --> 17:59.341
- No vomiting?
- No.

17:59.343 --> 18:00.775
I dropped him.

18:00.777 --> 18:02.511
I lost my balance.

18:02.513 --> 18:04.380
- You tripped?
- No, I...

18:04.382 --> 18:05.514
I don't know.

18:05.516 --> 18:07.849
Menopause, maybe.

18:07.851 --> 18:09.684
He hasn't got a concussion, has he?

18:09.686 --> 18:11.452
Well, any time you hit your head,

18:11.454 --> 18:13.555
there's always some degree of concussion.

18:15.025 --> 18:17.191
Mm. No, his reactions are perfect.

18:17.193 --> 18:18.459
Just a bump.

18:18.461 --> 18:21.129
If you tell Alex, she's gonna
think that I was drinking.

18:23.767 --> 18:25.966
Because there have been times...
well, a lifetime ago...

18:25.968 --> 18:27.535
that if something like this happened,

18:27.537 --> 18:29.203
it would have meant
that I was drinking.

18:29.205 --> 18:32.540
Well, I can't treat Luke and not tell her.

18:32.542 --> 18:34.542
Oh, please. I just got her back.

18:34.544 --> 18:36.810
I'm trying to prove that I've changed.

18:36.812 --> 18:39.414
Well, I don't think you're drunk.

18:39.416 --> 18:43.316
But in my experience,
one lie leads to a web of lies.

18:44.554 --> 18:48.155
It's a metaphor for when a fly
gets stuck into a spider's web,

18:48.157 --> 18:50.691
which I don't want to be.

18:52.227 --> 18:55.796
Okay, if you get Luke out of here now...

18:55.798 --> 18:58.198
then I won't mention it.

18:58.200 --> 19:00.534
Oh. You'll never see us again.

19:00.536 --> 19:02.569
But if there's vomiting, I want to see him.

19:02.571 --> 19:05.505
I got it. Hey, buddy.

19:05.507 --> 19:07.340
Should we go get some ice cream?

19:07.342 --> 19:08.408
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:08.410 --> 19:09.476
Okay. Come on.

19:09.478 --> 19:10.544
Can I have a kiss?

19:12.881 --> 19:14.581
Dr. Miller.

19:14.583 --> 19:16.182
In here.

19:16.184 --> 19:19.185
There are men here saying

19:19.187 --> 19:20.820
they're taking the X-Ray machines back?

19:20.822 --> 19:22.822
What? They're not supposed to
take those till next week!

19:22.824 --> 19:24.591
So, what, we're back to good
old-fashioned country doctoring?

19:24.593 --> 19:26.258
I'll be out in a minute.

19:27.428 --> 19:30.429
This emergency room's closing?

19:30.431 --> 19:34.100
No, we are transitioning
into an Urgent Care facility.

19:34.102 --> 19:35.434
What's that?

19:35.436 --> 19:37.369
It's when there's urgency
but it's not an emergency.

19:37.371 --> 19:39.538
- You mean like a walk-in clinic?
- No.

19:39.540 --> 19:41.873
It has the hours of a walk-in clinic

19:41.875 --> 19:43.742
but the integrity of an ER.

19:43.744 --> 19:47.346
You don't strike me
as a walk-in clinic kind of guy.

19:47.348 --> 19:50.749
Well, sometimes life doesn't
turn out the way you want it to,

19:50.751 --> 19:54.086
and sometimes you got to take
care of your responsibilities

19:54.088 --> 19:55.921
and put on a pair pantaloons.

19:55.923 --> 19:57.422
Ugh.

19:59.226 --> 20:01.093
- What's that?
- Huh?

20:01.095 --> 20:04.262
Oh, just a rash.

20:04.264 --> 20:06.864
Happens a lot in my line
of work, what with the chafing.

20:06.866 --> 20:09.066
It looks a lot more serious than that.

20:09.068 --> 20:11.236
- Doc.
- Hmm?

20:11.238 --> 20:13.138
If I was wearing pants,
you would have missed it.

20:13.140 --> 20:14.405
If you were wearing pants,

20:14.407 --> 20:15.740
you probably wouldn't have
gotten it in the first place.

20:15.742 --> 20:16.941
I'm gonna have to run some cultures.

20:16.943 --> 20:19.076
Can I get a nurse in here?

20:22.115 --> 20:23.413
Okay, Cassie.

20:23.415 --> 20:25.816
Once we get this last plate on,
we'll reattached the tip.

20:25.818 --> 20:27.251
I can close if you want.

20:27.253 --> 20:29.286
- Okay.
- Hey, Doc.

20:29.288 --> 20:33.323
You know, they say you can't
drink your problems away?

20:33.325 --> 20:36.426
What if your problem is
you're thirsty?

20:36.428 --> 20:37.427
Huh?

20:38.830 --> 20:40.697
I'm not your wife.

20:40.699 --> 20:41.865
What?

20:41.867 --> 20:43.733
I said "knife."

20:47.540 --> 20:51.275
You know, I, uh, I got into
a fight with a mastodon.

20:51.277 --> 20:54.778
I told him it was irr-elephant. [irrelevant]

20:54.780 --> 20:56.913
I heard you were the new Interim Chief.

20:56.915 --> 20:58.114
Yeah, that's the rumor.

20:58.116 --> 20:59.783
I didn't think you'd want to be Chief again.

20:59.785 --> 21:00.850
I don't.

21:00.852 --> 21:02.886
Is it because
you find it too difficult

21:02.888 --> 21:04.688
to be everyone's boss and friend?

21:04.690 --> 21:06.289
What did the piece of bread say

21:06.291 --> 21:08.191
when it walked
into the operating room?

21:08.193 --> 21:10.060
Well, I just got tired
of saying things like,

21:10.062 --> 21:11.760
"You need to take this more seriously."

21:11.762 --> 21:12.895
Nothing.

21:12.897 --> 21:14.863
It was coma-toast. [comatose]

21:14.865 --> 21:17.132
And also making
life-and-death decisions

21:17.134 --> 21:18.867
for really invested surgeons.

21:18.869 --> 21:20.269
Come on, that's good!

21:20.271 --> 21:21.904
I didn't want
to be Chief of Surgery anymore

21:21.906 --> 21:23.639
because I wanted
a more balanced life with Alex.

21:23.641 --> 21:26.809
What if... What if you're
coma-toast was irr-elephant?

21:26.811 --> 21:28.110
Are you thirsty, Doc?

21:28.112 --> 21:31.880
Why was the coma-toast bread
thirsty?

21:31.882 --> 21:34.717
Because he was irr-elephant.

21:34.719 --> 21:36.852
Everything okay?

21:38.455 --> 21:39.955
Um...

21:39.957 --> 21:43.391
it's irr-elephant.

21:47.231 --> 21:49.698
What's happening here?

21:49.700 --> 21:51.633
NG tube is down.

21:51.635 --> 21:53.201
Nothing yet.

21:53.203 --> 21:55.637
Okay, let's see what we've got.

21:55.639 --> 21:58.039
Well, abdomen is not distended at all.

21:58.041 --> 21:59.407
Great. So, as soon as it takes,

21:59.409 --> 22:01.042
we'll feed the study drug down the tube

22:01.044 --> 22:03.444
and she won't miss her trial dose.

22:03.446 --> 22:06.347
Localized pain,
and her pressure's falling.

22:06.349 --> 22:09.250
You think
it's a closed-loop obstruction?

22:09.252 --> 22:10.718
Those things go necrotic fast.

22:10.720 --> 22:12.986
I want to get this patient
into surgery right away.

22:12.988 --> 22:14.488
No, no, no. We just... We give it more time.

22:14.490 --> 22:15.489
I'm pulling rank.

22:15.491 --> 22:17.057
- No, you can't!
- Excuse me.

22:18.093 --> 22:21.161
I didn't put the stop on the
next dose of her blood thinners.

22:21.163 --> 22:22.595
Maggie, I told you to hold off.

22:22.597 --> 22:24.364
Now she's more of a bleed risk.

22:24.366 --> 22:26.566
I thought we were avoiding surgery,
and I didn't want her to clot again.

22:26.568 --> 22:28.568
Okay, listen, I want an anti-Xa test

22:28.570 --> 22:30.237
to see how thin her blood is.

22:30.239 --> 22:31.238
Okay.

22:31.240 --> 22:32.906
I'm scrubbing in.

22:32.908 --> 22:36.209
And, Maggie, I want you to assist,

22:36.211 --> 22:40.546
but if you think you're too close to this,
you need to page Dr. Williams.

22:42.284 --> 22:44.517
My son knows what to do.

22:44.519 --> 22:47.420
He needs to wear his helmet, Luke.

22:47.422 --> 22:49.188
Are you here? Is that you? Luke?

22:49.190 --> 22:51.023
Can you follow through with this?

22:51.025 --> 22:52.124
Mrs. Reid.

22:52.126 --> 22:53.159
Mrs. Reid.

22:53.161 --> 22:54.459
Mrs. Reid, why are you still here?

22:54.461 --> 22:56.528
This is exactly
what I told you not to do.

22:56.530 --> 22:59.231
I have a dog who makes pancakes.

22:59.233 --> 23:01.200
It's the strangest thing.

23:01.202 --> 23:03.303
- I'm sorry, what?
- They took my rings.

23:03.303 --> 23:04.369
Can you help me? They're thieves!

23:04.371 --> 23:05.971
Mom, what are you doing here?

23:05.973 --> 23:07.106
It's not my fault.

23:07.108 --> 23:08.607
Don't give the dog the recipe.

23:08.609 --> 23:09.608
Luke!

23:09.610 --> 23:11.310
What happened to him?

23:11.312 --> 23:13.312
- Where are the police?
- He's got a bump on his forehead, Mom.

23:13.314 --> 23:15.162
Yes, Alex, he's fine.
I think we have another problem here.

23:15.162 --> 23:16.939
- They took my rings, Alex.
- Are you drunk?

23:16.939 --> 23:17.915
How could you do this to us?

23:17.918 --> 23:19.818
You know, it's my fault.
I should have known. I should have known.

23:19.820 --> 23:21.886
My gut said don't trust her
because she's totally untrust...

23:21.888 --> 23:23.755
- No. Alex, just...
- Mom.

23:23.757 --> 23:25.890
- Let's get someone down here.
- Mom. Here we go.

23:25.892 --> 23:28.259
Listen to my voice.
You're gonna be just fine.

23:28.261 --> 23:29.360
You're gonna be fine.

23:33.877 --> 23:36.443
She hasn't been drinking,
but I am quite concerned.

23:36.445 --> 23:38.846
What do you think's happening to her?

23:38.848 --> 23:40.648
Just getting old, baby.

23:40.650 --> 23:43.384
Man on P.A.:
Dr. Reid to O.R. number 4.

23:43.386 --> 23:45.519
- Dr. Reid, O.R. number 4.
- Go.

23:45.521 --> 23:47.621
There isn't anything new I can
tell you right now, anyway.

23:47.623 --> 23:49.256
- I need to run some more tests.
- You sure?

23:49.258 --> 23:51.825
Mm-hmm. Yeah. I've got your mother.

23:51.827 --> 23:53.693
And I'll get this little guy
back to day care.

23:53.695 --> 23:55.029
You take care of your patient.

23:55.031 --> 23:56.196
Go to Uncle Shahir. Okay.

23:56.198 --> 23:57.664
Come here, buddy. Here we go.

23:57.666 --> 23:58.865
Come here, Luke. Okay.

23:58.867 --> 23:59.866
Thank you.

23:59.868 --> 24:04.404
I got this.

24:10.846 --> 24:12.979
Maggie.

24:12.981 --> 24:14.147
What have we got?

24:14.149 --> 24:16.082
Okay, I tested Bree's blood,

24:16.084 --> 24:17.883
and I won't lie to you...

24:17.885 --> 24:19.218
Then don't.

24:19.220 --> 24:21.454
If we reverse the blood thinners
and she throws another clot,

24:21.456 --> 24:22.788
we're screwed.

24:22.790 --> 24:27.060
Okay, so, we do the surgery
with lots of clamps and sponges,

24:27.062 --> 24:30.329
and we do our best
to manage the bleed risk.

24:30.331 --> 24:31.364
Yeah.

24:33.834 --> 24:36.168
Maggie, I need you on your game.

24:36.170 --> 24:37.836
100%.

24:37.838 --> 24:40.706
I couldn't ask for her
to be in better hands.

24:43.844 --> 24:45.477
Mrs. Stone.

24:45.479 --> 24:47.212
Oh, Dr. Harris.

24:47.214 --> 24:49.147
Um, your husband is almost out of surgery,

24:49.149 --> 24:50.715
and his arm should be just fine.

24:50.717 --> 24:51.883
Oh, good.

24:51.885 --> 24:54.352
But I'm wondering about him... personally.

24:54.354 --> 24:55.454
Oh.

24:55.456 --> 24:57.689
Has his behavior been different lately?

24:57.691 --> 24:59.691
Oh, yes, actually.

24:59.693 --> 25:01.826
We haven't had this much fun in years.

25:01.828 --> 25:03.161
Has he always been such a joker?

25:03.163 --> 25:04.329
Oh, God, no.

25:04.331 --> 25:08.066
He woke up one day
and started cracking jokes.

25:08.068 --> 25:09.634
Yeah, if you don't mind my asking,

25:09.636 --> 25:11.335
what was Peter like before all this?

25:13.873 --> 25:18.876
Eight years ago, uh...

25:18.878 --> 25:22.079
we walked out of a cemetery...

25:22.081 --> 25:26.049
leaving our son in a box in the ground.

25:26.051 --> 25:29.620
So... not great.

25:29.622 --> 25:32.055
I'm sorry.

25:32.057 --> 25:33.790
Thank you.

25:33.792 --> 25:36.460
Then when did all the funny start?

25:39.331 --> 25:40.631
About three weeks ago.

25:40.633 --> 25:42.565
He also joined an improv troop.

25:44.837 --> 25:45.869
Mrs. Stone...

25:45.871 --> 25:48.672
I'd like to confer with a neurosurgeon.

25:50.208 --> 25:52.275
You want to get his head checked

25:52.277 --> 25:54.710
because he developed a sense of humor?

26:00.952 --> 26:03.085
I'm not worried,
'cause you're as tough as nails.

26:03.087 --> 26:07.056
Okay, but if I say anything dumb
when I pass out,

26:07.058 --> 26:09.392
you can't put it YouTube.

26:09.394 --> 26:11.694
I would never.

26:13.230 --> 26:16.132
Are we still on the road to recovery?

26:16.134 --> 26:21.070
Well, I have a Google alert set
for Kelly's next tour, so...

26:22.674 --> 26:24.740
Roxy.

26:26.243 --> 26:29.411
Count backwards from 50 for me, hon.

26:29.413 --> 26:33.848
- 50, 49, 48...
- 50, 49, 48...

26:37.354 --> 26:40.656
Hey. What's this?

26:40.658 --> 26:43.058
We're about the resect the bowel
of a Stage 4 BC Mets patient

26:43.060 --> 26:44.325
with a partial blockage.

26:44.327 --> 26:45.994
This is the patient
that was on blood thinners.

26:45.996 --> 26:47.461
Yes.

26:47.463 --> 26:50.031
Have you taken precautions to
ensure she's not a bleed risk?

26:52.669 --> 26:55.036
Yes.

26:55.038 --> 26:57.706
Okay.

27:01.377 --> 27:03.211
So, preliminary tests reveal

27:03.213 --> 27:06.347
that Peter has a subarachnoid
hemorrhage in his brain,

27:06.349 --> 27:08.549
which has been presenting as humor.

27:09.686 --> 27:11.952
So, let me get this straight.

27:11.954 --> 27:15.456
My sense of humor has been
caused by an aneurysm?

27:15.458 --> 27:18.158
Well, it's not as uncommon as you'd think.

27:19.195 --> 27:21.628
And if I have the surgery...

27:21.630 --> 27:24.832
will I wake up and not be funny anymore?

27:24.834 --> 27:28.202
Well, you brain will go back
to the way it was before.

27:33.742 --> 27:35.141
No.

27:35.143 --> 27:37.143
No, I don't want the surgery.

27:37.145 --> 27:39.145
Peter, if you don't have the surgery...

27:39.147 --> 27:40.547
you'll die.

27:40.549 --> 27:42.315
Dr. Harris is right.

27:42.317 --> 27:45.552
Well, then, of course
he's gonna have the surgery.

27:45.554 --> 27:47.487
Well, what will I tell Elderprov?

27:47.489 --> 27:49.222
We've got a show next month.

27:49.224 --> 27:50.923
I don't know.

27:50.925 --> 27:55.194
But, Peter... I can't lose you, too.

28:04.463 --> 28:06.605
Running the bowel. Nothing yet.

28:06.607 --> 28:08.574
Ooh, it's all over my shoes.

28:11.186 --> 28:12.378
And here it is.

28:12.380 --> 28:14.112
Wow. That's... that's dead.

28:14.114 --> 28:15.447
Kelly.

28:15.449 --> 28:18.384
Clamps.

28:18.386 --> 28:20.252
Keep them coming.

28:20.254 --> 28:21.920
Mm-hmm.

28:23.456 --> 28:26.024
Clamps are holding.

28:26.026 --> 28:28.960
Just a few small controllable bleeds.

28:28.962 --> 28:30.762
We still have to put
this whole thing back together.

28:30.764 --> 28:32.030
Yeah.

28:34.134 --> 28:36.201
Pressure's dropping.

28:36.203 --> 28:38.870
- Blood thinners... she's bleeding out.
- Okay, sponges. And keep them coming.

28:46.159 --> 28:47.137
Removing the bowel.

28:47.137 --> 28:48.509
Keep the fluids coming, please.

28:48.509 --> 28:51.164
I'm trying, but the blood gas
numbers are off the chart.

28:51.166 --> 28:52.965
Whatever you guys are doing,
you need to hurry.

28:52.967 --> 28:54.834
Maggie, I need you to clamp
the superior mesenteric artery.

28:54.836 --> 28:55.902
I can't see anything.

28:55.904 --> 28:57.336
I know we want to stop the bleeding,

28:57.338 --> 28:59.338
but if we clamp for too long,
we kill the entire bowel.

28:59.340 --> 29:01.173
The clamp buys us time.
I'm only gonna be a few minutes.

29:01.175 --> 29:03.108
Well, that's all you've got, so... clamp.

29:03.110 --> 29:04.143
Sutures.

29:06.781 --> 29:08.347
Clamp in place.

29:08.349 --> 29:10.715
Starting the anastomosis.

29:14.355 --> 29:16.321
- Blood pressure is leveling off.
- Great.

29:17.858 --> 29:19.624
You okay?

29:19.626 --> 29:21.593
I got too involved.

29:21.595 --> 29:23.462
I risked her life.

29:23.464 --> 29:24.763
She's gonna be fine, Maggie.

29:24.765 --> 29:27.498
How do you always keep
the emotion out of the OR?

29:27.500 --> 29:31.036
I wish I was a doctor robot.

29:31.038 --> 29:33.504
No, you don't.

29:39.112 --> 29:41.179
So, your surgeon's down there

29:41.181 --> 29:43.147
turning me back into a broken man.

29:43.149 --> 29:47.118
He's just picking up pieces
of a brain hemorrhage.

29:47.120 --> 29:49.253
The rest is up to you.

29:51.057 --> 29:53.591
We've been through hell.

29:53.593 --> 29:57.562
Lived in a house of gloom for years.

29:57.564 --> 30:00.064
And then this...

30:00.066 --> 30:01.498
levity.

30:03.168 --> 30:06.436
I thought it was a gift.

30:09.408 --> 30:14.111
Well, the human brain's a mystery, but...

30:14.113 --> 30:18.148
maybe this aneurysm happened to...

30:18.150 --> 30:21.518
remind you of who you were,

30:21.520 --> 30:22.586
where you were headed

30:22.588 --> 30:24.354
before what happened to your son.

30:26.391 --> 30:30.960
I was so excited to see him grow up.

30:30.962 --> 30:33.195
He liked to sing.

30:33.197 --> 30:38.735
He was shy, but I could hear him
in his room.

30:41.239 --> 30:43.239
The levity.

30:44.709 --> 30:46.943
It's slipping away. I can feel it.

30:46.945 --> 30:49.878
No. No.

30:49.880 --> 30:52.047
It's still there.

30:52.049 --> 30:55.284
Come on. Tell me a joke.

30:55.286 --> 30:57.019
Okay.

30:57.021 --> 30:58.720
Uh...

30:58.722 --> 31:05.427
a guy walks into a bar...

31:12.703 --> 31:14.469
You.

31:14.471 --> 31:16.038
Me.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.806
Your rash is caused by a tick bite.

31:17.808 --> 31:19.041
You have Lyme disease.

31:19.043 --> 31:21.276
Means I go great with tequila?

31:21.278 --> 31:22.510
It's serious.

31:22.512 --> 31:24.078
It can cause neurocognitive symptoms,

31:24.080 --> 31:25.380
along with muscle joint pains.

31:25.382 --> 31:27.415
I need to get you on
an antibiotic drip right away.

31:27.417 --> 31:29.016
Hey. Hey!

31:29.018 --> 31:31.486
You can't take that!

31:31.488 --> 31:33.388
Hang on a sec.

31:33.390 --> 31:34.689
Can I get a doxycycline drip

31:34.691 --> 31:36.357
for our fleshy friend in Bed number 4?

31:36.359 --> 31:37.358
What's going on here?

31:37.360 --> 31:39.326
Zach, Mrs. White is here again.

31:39.328 --> 31:40.527
Heart palpitations?

31:40.529 --> 31:42.697
And they're taking the ECG machine.

31:42.699 --> 31:43.864
Thomas.

31:43.866 --> 31:45.199
Hi, Mrs. White.

31:45.201 --> 31:46.366
Hi.

31:46.368 --> 31:47.568
How did you get here?

31:47.570 --> 31:49.003
I'm with the Uber now.

31:49.005 --> 31:51.072
Right. You're having some chest pains?

31:51.074 --> 31:53.473
I'm just a little thumpy again.

31:53.475 --> 31:54.608
Right.

31:55.644 --> 31:57.811
Okay, I need this ECG machine.

31:57.813 --> 31:59.813
Dr. Miller, you seem upset.

31:59.815 --> 32:01.881
I need this ECG machine now.

32:01.883 --> 32:03.684
These men are just doing
what I've asked them do, Zach.

32:03.686 --> 32:04.884
Until the light outside goes dark,

32:04.886 --> 32:06.886
we are an ER
and we save lives, Thomas.

32:06.888 --> 32:08.822
Zachary's been with me for
all four of my heart attacks.

32:08.824 --> 32:11.191
That's right. I've been with her
for all four of her heart attacks.

32:11.193 --> 32:12.258
Yeah!

32:12.260 --> 32:14.127
- You stick it to 'em, Doc!
- Who's that?

32:14.129 --> 32:17.430
That is a little something
that you do not need to see.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.367
Shahir.

32:23.338 --> 32:24.871
Any news on my mother?

32:24.873 --> 32:26.339
I'm concerned about her scan.

32:26.341 --> 32:27.673
How so?

32:27.675 --> 32:30.309
I don't want to speculate yet,
but dizziness, memory loss...

32:30.311 --> 32:32.311
I'd like to admit her for tests.

32:32.313 --> 32:34.046
- What do you think it is?
- I don't want to speculate.

32:34.048 --> 32:35.314
- Shahir.
- Alex.

32:35.316 --> 32:38.284
Just tuck this away until
I have a conclusive diagnosis.

32:38.286 --> 32:40.152
Okay.

32:40.154 --> 32:42.020
Alex, I'll do everything I can.

32:43.558 --> 32:45.624
Thank you.

32:49.563 --> 32:52.898
All right, one course of antibiotics,

32:52.900 --> 32:54.733
one orange jumpsuit.

32:54.735 --> 32:57.702
Listen, if you have any symptoms

32:57.704 --> 32:59.872
like lack of sleep
or muscle pain, I think you...

32:59.874 --> 33:02.039
Tell my prison guards to send the ambulance

33:02.041 --> 33:05.644
to a hospital with a real ER doctor?

33:06.680 --> 33:07.879
Look.

33:07.881 --> 33:11.383
Do you have anyone
that's gonna bail you out?

33:11.385 --> 33:14.319
Nah. I'm a lone wolf.

33:14.321 --> 33:16.488
Put on some pants.

33:16.490 --> 33:17.855
Pants...

33:17.857 --> 33:19.257
are prison.

33:19.259 --> 33:20.424
No.

33:20.426 --> 33:22.493
Prison is a prison. Can't you compromise?

33:22.495 --> 33:24.028
That's what you're doing, and look at you.

33:24.030 --> 33:25.729
- You're a wreck.
- I'm a wreck?

33:25.731 --> 33:28.699
You're not an Urgent Care guy!

33:28.701 --> 33:30.434
You're a stallion!

33:30.436 --> 33:34.938
And i-it's killing me
to watch you bend over, man.

33:34.940 --> 33:38.175
Look, you put the pants on,
you walk out of here, you're a free man.

33:38.177 --> 33:40.711
This from a man
who can't even see the cage

33:40.713 --> 33:42.713
that's getting built around him.

33:45.685 --> 33:48.919
Woman on P.A.: Dr. Lin to ICU.

33:48.921 --> 33:51.587
Dr. Lin to ICU.

33:51.589 --> 33:52.856
Alex?

33:54.014 --> 33:55.525
What's going on?

33:55.527 --> 33:57.227
GCS of three.

33:59.698 --> 34:01.531
She's got no Plantar's reflex.

34:01.533 --> 34:02.799
Oh, come on, Bree.

34:02.801 --> 34:04.400
Anything?

34:05.704 --> 34:07.003
No.

34:07.005 --> 34:10.406
She's in a coma.

34:24.348 --> 34:25.596
Dr. Harris.

34:25.817 --> 34:27.484
You're accepting the chiefdom.

34:27.485 --> 34:29.719
Yeah. What the hell? Why not?

34:29.721 --> 34:31.187
Fantastic news.

34:31.188 --> 34:33.723
Thought I'd have more trouble
convincing you.

34:33.725 --> 34:34.891
What can I tell you?

34:34.893 --> 34:36.726
I, um...

34:36.728 --> 34:38.860
I touched in
with several departments today.

34:38.862 --> 34:39.962
I heard.

34:39.964 --> 34:41.664
A bone doctor
who diagnoses brain bleeds.

34:41.666 --> 34:43.134
You're a one-man band.

34:43.134 --> 34:45.534
Yeah. I forgot how much I enjoy
the big picture, you know?

34:45.536 --> 34:47.402
Plus, you just put me in a great position

34:47.405 --> 34:50.840
to, um... keep my eye on you.

34:53.377 --> 34:56.210
Welcome aboard, Chief Harris.

34:58.750 --> 35:04.953
Shut the door on your way out.

35:06.490 --> 35:07.756
It's my study.

35:07.758 --> 35:08.924
I did the surgery,

35:08.926 --> 35:11.193
so it makes me responsible for Bree's coma.

35:12.317 --> 35:14.163
But a coma isn't dead.

35:14.165 --> 35:17.366
No, but she's having a functionary breakdown

35:17.368 --> 35:19.400
with her reticular activating
system, so it's not great.

35:19.402 --> 35:20.802
Yeah.

35:20.804 --> 35:23.705
Kind of like sleeping off a bad bender.

35:23.707 --> 35:24.773
Right.

35:24.775 --> 35:26.041
Not even close. Just...

35:26.043 --> 35:27.508
Never mind. Forget about it.

35:27.510 --> 35:29.711
Go home. You need sleep.

35:29.713 --> 35:31.613
I'm not gonna sleep anyway.

35:31.615 --> 35:35.550
Well, I'd sure hope that anybody
who might be doing surgery on me

35:35.552 --> 35:38.119
hadn't spent the previous night
in an uncomfortable chair.

35:40.052 --> 35:43.357
Tests aren't something
to bunk in the hospital for.

35:44.894 --> 35:47.962
If this turns out to be serious,
I might need you,

35:47.964 --> 35:51.699
and you don't owe me that many days.

35:51.701 --> 35:56.136
Besides, I need to work on my Pinterest page

35:56.138 --> 36:00.641
so that I can fix up that
bachelor squat you call a condo.

36:00.643 --> 36:04.745
I have eight beautiful lofts
for you to choose from.

36:04.747 --> 36:06.480
Okay, let me see.

36:08.217 --> 36:11.851
I don't hate them.

36:11.853 --> 36:13.286
You do know me.

36:13.288 --> 36:15.355
Well, you're my kid.

36:15.357 --> 36:18.791
I've known you since your first breath.

36:20.329 --> 36:22.762
Mom, you're gonna be okay.

36:22.764 --> 36:26.866
Yeah.

36:26.868 --> 36:28.601
Well, I am pretty well-connected.

36:49.023 --> 36:50.556
This is the right choice.

36:50.558 --> 36:51.923
It will free up money.

36:51.925 --> 36:53.859
More money means more lives saved.

36:53.861 --> 36:55.894
You weren't kidding about not being liked.

36:57.264 --> 37:01.566
People might dismiss us as young
and inexperienced, Cassie,

37:01.568 --> 37:05.603
but... we're the future.

37:09.309 --> 37:12.678
Speaking of the future,
what are you doing later?

37:12.680 --> 37:15.780
I could buy you dinner.

37:15.782 --> 37:17.114
This is the best.

37:17.116 --> 37:20.851
Can't find it in pharmacies,
but you can take it all.

37:20.853 --> 37:22.520
Where you gonna put it?

37:22.522 --> 37:25.190
Doc, you just leave that to me.

37:25.192 --> 37:27.625
Okay. Just...

37:31.197 --> 37:32.396
Now.

37:38.137 --> 37:40.337
Let's go.

37:40.339 --> 37:47.744
Come, come, come, come.

37:49.648 --> 37:51.881
I hope you get out of the petting zoo.

37:51.883 --> 37:54.751
I hope the weather holds.

38:07.498 --> 38:09.065
Zach, is that a naked man

38:09.067 --> 38:11.067
streaking across the ambulance bay?

38:11.069 --> 38:13.203
Yes, it is.

38:13.205 --> 38:15.338
Chief.

38:15.340 --> 38:16.439
I heard.

38:16.441 --> 38:19.842
You can't make me wear pants, either.

38:19.844 --> 38:21.110
Okay.

38:21.112 --> 38:22.612
I quit.

38:22.614 --> 38:25.781
Enjoy Dawn's office.

38:44.434 --> 38:47.636
You, um, heard the one about
the guy who walked into a bar?

38:47.638 --> 38:50.639
Maybe not the one about the guy
who walked into the bar

38:50.641 --> 38:52.741
who hasn't called me since college.

38:53.710 --> 38:55.076
What do you want, Charlie Harris?

38:55.078 --> 38:58.280
Well, uh, "he" wanted to know
what you were drinking.

38:58.282 --> 39:00.448
Well, that's not a very funny joke.

39:00.450 --> 39:01.616
No, you're right.

39:01.618 --> 39:03.385
I might be a little bit funnied out today.

39:03.387 --> 39:07.555
I had, um, this patient who
almost joked himself to death.

39:07.557 --> 39:08.723
Huh.

39:08.725 --> 39:10.825
I got a funny doctor joke.

39:10.827 --> 39:12.726
I'm just looking for the fire exit.

39:12.728 --> 39:13.828
Hey!

39:13.830 --> 39:15.362
You called me.

39:15.364 --> 39:17.364
I'll tell you what...

39:17.366 --> 39:19.767
If I make you laugh...

39:19.769 --> 39:22.736
you get to come home with me.

39:24.274 --> 39:26.307
I really hope this is funny, then.

39:27.343 --> 39:30.944
A guy walks in to the doctor
complaining of a stiff neck.

39:30.946 --> 39:32.112
Uh-huh.

39:32.114 --> 39:34.581
Doctor takes one look at him
and prescribes...

39:34.583 --> 39:36.617
Can I get two... He prescribes...

39:36.619 --> 39:38.452
Uh, yeah, he prescribes Ibuprofen

39:38.454 --> 39:39.653
every four to six hours

39:39.655 --> 39:41.188
and alternating
hot and cold compresses.

39:41.190 --> 39:42.455
Very good.

39:42.457 --> 39:45.725
Doctor also says to the patient,
"It might be, you know,"

39:45.727 --> 39:48.494
"a good idea if you refrain
from masturbating."

39:48.496 --> 39:51.932
And the patient's incredulous
and looks at the doctor says,

39:51.934 --> 39:53.533
"Why do I have to do that?"

39:53.535 --> 39:54.567
The doctor says,

39:54.569 --> 39:56.369
"Because I'm still examining you."

39:58.373 --> 40:00.373
Check. Please.

40:00.375 --> 40:01.974
Thank you.

41:13.679 --> 41:16.814
So, I try not to let it get to me.

41:16.816 --> 41:21.451
So you just throw yourself
into the work even further?

41:21.453 --> 41:26.723
Yeah, but then the shift is over
and it kind of creeps back in.

41:26.725 --> 41:29.459
And then you come home to a kid every night.

41:29.461 --> 41:31.428
I wouldn't know how to do it.

41:31.430 --> 41:35.565
Nah, see, he's the part that
makes everything worthwhile.

41:35.567 --> 41:36.934
Hmm.

41:38.403 --> 41:39.803
Thank you for this.

41:39.805 --> 41:41.805
It is just what I needed.

41:41.807 --> 41:44.574
Yeah, you're welcome.

41:44.576 --> 41:45.909
Um, I-I wouldn't thank me, though.

41:45.911 --> 41:50.246
I'd thank The Magical Buppa Thai.

41:55.086 --> 41:57.253
Guess we should, um...

41:57.255 --> 41:58.955
call it a night.

41:58.957 --> 42:01.090
Like another night.

42:01.092 --> 42:03.592
Oh, yeah?

42:03.594 --> 42:06.395
I'm just saying that I do an excellent
Mexican takeout, as well.

42:08.399 --> 42:09.999
I bet.

42:21.545 --> 42:22.845
Night, Manny.

42:22.847 --> 42:25.881
Good night.
