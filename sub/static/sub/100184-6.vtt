[Alice]
<i>I thought last night</i>

00:09.551 --> 00:10.552
was great.

00:10.635 --> 00:12.053
She's my ex‐wife.

00:12.137 --> 00:13.763
‐Do you want me to leave?
‐No.

00:13.847 --> 00:17.725
‐Okay, we are getting somewhere.
‐So you're a throuple now?

00:17.809 --> 00:18.852
Wait, wait, what are you,
what are you saying?

00:18.935 --> 00:20.186
‐[both] Throuple.
‐It's a couple plus one.

00:20.270 --> 00:24.399
You were wondering if I could
get over the whole priest thing.

00:24.482 --> 00:26.234
Well, I can because
you're not a real priest.

[Rebecca]
<i>I don't know</i>

00:27.861 --> 00:29.654
who hurt you,
but somebody did.

00:29.737 --> 00:31.990
You need to work
on your own shit.

00:32.073 --> 00:34.325
What the hell is wrong with you?

00:34.409 --> 00:36.536
You were just gonna slip in
that biological parent clause?

00:36.619 --> 00:38.872
I'm trying to do
what's best for my family.

00:38.955 --> 00:40.540
She is your family.

00:40.623 --> 00:42.834
There's not going
to be a prenup.

00:42.917 --> 00:44.669
‐We're not done discussing this.
‐Fuck you.

00:44.752 --> 00:45.962
Hey!

00:46.045 --> 00:47.255
We need to end this.

00:47.338 --> 00:48.840
What am I supposed to do now?

00:48.923 --> 00:50.925
I don't know.

00:52.635 --> 00:53.845
What do we do, huh?
You've got an event.

00:53.928 --> 00:56.431

00:58.933 --> 01:01.186
I have to tell you
something.

01:01.269 --> 01:03.813
‐I'm pregnant.
‐What?

01:03.897 --> 01:06.649
She processes everything alone.

01:06.733 --> 01:07.984
I mean, how
do I get her

01:08.067 --> 01:09.652
to open up to me?

01:09.736 --> 01:10.820
It's my dad.

01:10.904 --> 01:16.117
[crying] I hate him because
he doesn't understand...

01:21.331 --> 01:23.875
[panting]

01:23.958 --> 01:27.170
I just wanted to let you know
that I don't need you.

01:28.963 --> 01:30.089
I just want you.

01:31.508 --> 01:32.175
‐You are amazing.
‐Shut up.

01:32.258 --> 01:35.553
No, you were.
I'm serious.

01:35.637 --> 01:37.722
Hey, Bette Porter,
I need to talk to you.

01:37.805 --> 01:39.807
‐Ow!
‐Goddamn it!

We're here outside
Bette Porter's home

01:58.117 --> 02:00.036
awaiting answers
from her campaign.

02:00.119 --> 02:03.456
Last night, mayoral
candidate Bette Porter

02:03.539 --> 02:05.583
allegedly assaulted
Tyler Adams.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.877
Porter has been having
an affair with his wife,

02:07.961 --> 02:11.214
despite recently denying
their status on <i>The Alice Show.</i>

02:11.297 --> 02:12.423
Her opponent Jeff Milner
is still committed to running

02:12.507 --> 02:15.718
a clean campaign, but couldn't
help but mention he's not

02:15.802 --> 02:19.347

by Porter's latest missteps.

02:19.430 --> 02:20.765

‐Alice, can we get
one comment, please?

02:20.848 --> 02:24.018
[overlapping chatter]

02:26.729 --> 02:28.731
Did you lie for her?

02:28.815 --> 02:30.608
Can you answer the question?

02:30.692 --> 02:31.526
[overlapping chatter]

02:31.609 --> 02:33.319
What do you have to say
for yourself?

02:36.531 --> 02:39.867
Right, but she was completely
justified in doing so.

02:39.951 --> 02:40.910
[knocking]

02:40.994 --> 02:42.954
All I'm asking
is for time.

02:43.037 --> 02:45.290
She wants to talk
to us and her family

02:45.373 --> 02:46.708
before she makes
a decision.

02:46.791 --> 02:48.626
‐[sighs] Hey.
‐[Alice] God, they're animals.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.962
Thank you so much for coming.
I'm sorry about all of this.

02:51.045 --> 02:52.130
No, no, it's okay.

02:52.213 --> 02:54.799
It's really not okay.

02:54.882 --> 02:56.551
She can bounce back
from this.

02:56.634 --> 02:59.470
I'm really,
I'm really sorry, Alice.

02:59.554 --> 03:03.474
For which part?
For defending you on my show,

03:03.558 --> 03:05.727
or for not telling me you
started seeing Felicity again?

03:05.810 --> 03:08.146
I'm... both. I'm sorry

03:08.229 --> 03:09.772
‐about both.
‐Why didn't you tell us?

03:15.028 --> 03:16.321
Why are you looking at her?

03:16.404 --> 03:18.156

Look, it's complicated,

03:18.239 --> 03:19.949

‐she's been through a lot.
‐Holy shit. You knew?

03:23.119 --> 03:25.538
‐You knew?
‐Calm down. Calm down.

03:25.621 --> 03:27.373
No, no, please don't
be mad at her.

03:27.457 --> 03:29.334
Oh, my God, this is so much
fucking worse, you guys.

03:29.417 --> 03:32.253
Alice, I am so sorry.

03:32.337 --> 03:34.339
‐I can't do this right now.
‐Alice, wait, just wait.

[Shane] Hey, Bette,
Bette, Bette, let her go.

03:39.093 --> 03:39.677
She'll cool off.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.387
You all right?

03:44.432 --> 03:46.392
No.

03:48.770 --> 03:51.022
Is Angie here?

03:51.105 --> 03:53.441
She spent the night at Jordi's.

03:56.652 --> 03:57.737
[sighs]

03:57.820 --> 04:00.656
We're both pretty shaken
up after last night,

04:00.740 --> 04:01.824
and I just wanted her
to go have fun.

04:01.908 --> 04:04.702
‐Good. Yeah.
‐You know?

04:04.786 --> 04:08.247
[phone chimes]

04:08.331 --> 04:10.291
‐Shit.
‐What?

04:10.375 --> 04:11.793
I was supposed to take her
to the DMV today.

04:11.876 --> 04:14.504
She's supposed to have
her driver's test today.

04:14.587 --> 04:17.256
How did I, how did
I forget that?

04:17.340 --> 04:19.300
‐How am I supposed to do that?
‐You can't.

04:19.384 --> 04:23.012
Everyone's gonna be
following you everywhere.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.347
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

04:24.430 --> 04:25.723
All right, all right, all right.
Here's an idea, here's an idea.

04:25.807 --> 04:27.725
I have to go to the bar,

04:27.809 --> 04:28.976
and then I have
to go pick up Quiara,

04:29.060 --> 04:31.312
and then we can take her.

04:31.396 --> 04:34.440
‐Really?
‐Yes, really.

04:34.524 --> 04:38.653
Anything you want,
my friend, anything you need.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.542
What?

04:52.625 --> 04:55.128

I just...

04:55.211 --> 04:57.255
Talk to me. What?

04:57.338 --> 05:00.591
I can't do this anymore.

05:00.675 --> 05:02.427
I can't.

‐I can't do it.
‐Okay, what‐what‐what...

‐That's just... I can't.
‐What‐what can't you do, Bette?

05:05.888 --> 05:11.936
I can't. I...
I have to drop out.

05:12.019 --> 05:13.688
Bette, you are allowed
Oto drop out any time you want.

05:13.771 --> 05:15.565
That's right.

05:15.648 --> 05:17.442
‐That's right. Okay.
‐Yeah.

05:17.525 --> 05:19.152
That's what I need.
I'm gonna do it

05:19.235 --> 05:21.070
right now, just
get it over with.

I can get you out of this.

Just give me‐‐
‐No, no. It's over.

I can't want
this anymore.

‐You cannot go out there.
‐I can't.

Yes, of course.

having a couple drinks.

Don't apologize. Um...

Which part?

08:44.482 --> 08:46.317
Well, was Jordi good?

08:46.400 --> 08:48.235

She was great... but...

What?

08:51.697 --> 08:54.367
I don't know how
I feel about her.

08:54.450 --> 08:56.494
What do you mean?

that likes our daughter

Mm.

they've had sex?

I've done right, I guess.

09:28.442 --> 09:30.945
You are doing a lot right.

Do you want to tell me
what happened last night?

09:41.205 --> 09:43.541
Uh...

09:45.001 --> 09:48.212
Well, we were, um... we
were all leaving the play.

09:48.295 --> 09:50.798
It was me and
Angie and Jordi.

09:50.881 --> 09:54.343
And... and I
could hear him

09:54.427 --> 09:56.762
before I saw
him, you know?

09:56.846 --> 09:58.222
He was screaming my name.

09:58.305 --> 09:59.724
I had the car keys,

09:59.807 --> 10:02.184
and I‐I gave them to
Angie, and I said, "Get to

10:02.268 --> 10:03.936
the car."
[sniffles]

10:04.020 --> 10:07.815
And then... and then he comes
barreling up the stairs at me.

10:10.776 --> 10:12.903
And then Angie stepped in
between us,

10:12.987 --> 10:16.157
almost like to protect me
or something. [sniffles]

10:16.240 --> 10:17.450
And then he, uh...

10:17.533 --> 10:20.453
he pushed her down
to the ground.

10:20.536 --> 10:23.998
He put his hands
on our daughter,

10:24.081 --> 10:26.584
and he fucking pushed
her to the ground.

10:26.667 --> 10:27.960
So, I‐I...

10:28.044 --> 10:31.255
I pushed him, and
he fell backwards,

10:31.338 --> 10:32.965
and I thought for a second...

I don't know.
I don't know...

No, I haven't seen her yet.

11:21.722 --> 11:24.600
Just so fucking annoyed!

11:24.683 --> 11:25.392
I can tell.

11:25.476 --> 11:27.978
Really going in
on that sando.

11:28.062 --> 11:30.815
Oh. She left at four
o'clock in the morning,

11:30.898 --> 11:32.274
and I haven't heard
from her since.

11:32.358 --> 11:33.359
Yeah.

11:33.442 --> 11:36.028
Kind of reminds me
of my mom.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.488
What?

11:37.571 --> 11:40.282
Yeah. She's like
a super‐cold hot lady.

11:40.366 --> 11:43.494
Who? Dani
or your mom?

11:43.577 --> 11:44.161
Both.

11:44.245 --> 11:46.664
You know what?

11:46.747 --> 11:49.166
You... you're a
fucking freak.

11:49.250 --> 11:50.292
‐Yeah, you love it.
‐[laughing]

11:50.376 --> 11:52.753
You'd like my mom. She's hot.
She's a fucking stud.

11:52.837 --> 11:53.587
Where do you think
these legs came from?

11:53.671 --> 11:55.756
This face?
What, are you kidding me?

11:55.840 --> 11:58.384
Oh, yeah, well,
at least you talk to me.

11:58.467 --> 11:59.343
Of course I talk to you.

11:59.426 --> 12:01.595
I love talking to you.

12:01.679 --> 12:03.264
You're, like,
the freaking best, dude.

12:03.347 --> 12:05.224
Well, if you love
talking to me so much,

12:05.307 --> 12:07.601
why don't you tell me
what happened last night?

12:08.352 --> 12:09.979
Mmm...

12:11.105 --> 12:13.440
You know what? I'm gonna
crush this sando first,

12:13.524 --> 12:14.316
and then go take a nip dip.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.694
‐Hmm.
‐Nip dip.

12:16.777 --> 12:18.112
I just came up with that.

12:18.195 --> 12:20.406
Like a poet.

12:20.489 --> 12:24.201
Like a regular
Emily Dickerstein.

12:25.369 --> 12:27.705
Yeah.

12:27.788 --> 12:29.790
She a little stupid.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.959
[crowd clamoring]

12:34.503 --> 12:37.715
[speaking indistinctly]

12:40.634 --> 12:42.386
That's utterly inflammatory.

12:42.469 --> 12:44.013
It was not an assault.

12:44.096 --> 12:48.601
She did what any decent mother
in her situation would do.

12:48.684 --> 12:51.729
No. That is not our
official statement.

12:51.812 --> 12:54.106
Mm‐hmm. Yeah.

12:54.190 --> 12:57.109
You'll be the first
to know when we have one.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.612
‐Fuck.
‐What's going on?

12:59.695 --> 13:00.988
Trying to convince donors
to trust Bette,

13:01.071 --> 13:04.241
but it's a hard sell because
I don't fucking trust her.

13:04.325 --> 13:05.451
I know this is hard.

13:05.534 --> 13:08.746
It's hard on all of us.

13:08.829 --> 13:10.372
[exhales]

13:11.665 --> 13:14.960
I'm sorry, when did you find out

13:15.044 --> 13:17.254
that Bette was still
sleeping with Felicity?

13:17.338 --> 13:18.797
Because I found out
this morning.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.843
‐I was just doing my job.
‐Dani,

13:22.927 --> 13:24.094
‐you should've told me.
‐It wouldn't have made

13:24.178 --> 13:25.763
‐a difference.
‐I don't like being lied to.

13:25.846 --> 13:27.723
You've been in politics
for so long,

13:27.806 --> 13:29.350
I thought you'd be
used to it by now.

13:31.894 --> 13:35.314
I have spent my career
supporting people

13:35.397 --> 13:36.857
who I believe would
do the least harm.

13:36.941 --> 13:40.402
And Bette was supposed
to be better than that.

13:43.656 --> 13:47.076
I'm sorry she disappointed you.

13:47.159 --> 13:50.120
It's not about just me,
Dani, it's about us.

13:50.204 --> 13:53.791
You, me,
those kids at the center.

13:55.793 --> 13:57.795
I'm a trans man.

13:57.878 --> 14:00.965
And seeing someone like
Bette Porter become mayor

14:01.048 --> 14:04.093
means that‐that people like me
might live a better life.

14:04.176 --> 14:07.262
I mean, she was supposed
to be the one to pave the way

14:07.346 --> 14:08.847
so that someone like me
could be in charge someday.

14:08.931 --> 14:12.726
I understand that,
but she can still win.

14:12.810 --> 14:14.186
[laughs softly]

14:14.269 --> 14:16.146
You know, people have been
looking for any reason

14:16.230 --> 14:18.607
to write off this campaign,
and she has given them plenty.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.067
[sighs]

14:22.653 --> 14:25.823
You have every right to be mad,

14:25.906 --> 14:28.951
but you can't deny
that she's special.

14:30.619 --> 14:32.538
She's inspiring.

14:32.621 --> 14:35.958
She inspires me every day.

14:36.041 --> 14:41.422
I've never felt like that
about anyone before.

14:41.505 --> 14:44.425
I know it might be hard
for you to see right now,

14:44.508 --> 14:47.803
but she's worth it.

14:49.555 --> 14:50.889
[sighs]

14:56.353 --> 14:57.730
I see.

14:57.813 --> 14:59.064
What?

15:02.151 --> 15:03.152
Yeah.

15:03.235 --> 15:05.988
Yeah, this is, this is
something else for you.

15:06.071 --> 15:08.323
What's that supposed to mean?

15:08.407 --> 15:10.784
She's gotten to you.

15:11.785 --> 15:13.620
No, no, she hasn't.

15:13.704 --> 15:14.955
‐This is...
‐Good luck.

15:15.039 --> 15:17.332
‐Where are you going?
‐You know,

15:17.416 --> 15:20.377
I really wanted her to be
the one to change the world,

15:20.461 --> 15:22.629
but I think I'm gonna

15:22.713 --> 15:24.381
have to do it on my own.

15:24.465 --> 15:26.842
Goodbye, Dani.

15:26.925 --> 15:30.054
[door opens, closes]

15:32.306 --> 15:33.557
[Shane]
How do you think she's doing?

15:33.640 --> 15:35.142
‐She's gonna pass, right?
‐[Quiara] Relax.

15:35.225 --> 15:36.393
I'm sure she's doing fine.

15:36.477 --> 15:37.603
‐She seems like a smart kid.
‐No, she's a fucking genius.

15:37.686 --> 15:39.688
I just don't trust these people.

15:39.772 --> 15:40.564
[chuckles]

15:40.647 --> 15:42.399
[Darcie]
Like, holy shit.

15:42.483 --> 15:44.735
You're Quiara.

15:44.818 --> 15:47.196
‐Yeah.
‐Oh, my God, I loved your set

15:47.279 --> 15:48.280
at Glastonbury last year.
I...

15:48.363 --> 15:49.907
‐It was absolutely amazing.
‐Oh.

15:49.990 --> 15:50.949
Thank you.

15:51.033 --> 15:51.784
Do you mind if I take
a picture with you?

15:51.867 --> 15:53.911
No, not at all.
Let's do it.

15:53.994 --> 15:55.120
You want me to do it?

15:55.204 --> 15:56.205
[Darcie]
Yes, thank you.

15:56.288 --> 15:57.623
‐You ready?
‐Yes.

15:57.706 --> 15:59.875
Okay. One, two...

15:59.958 --> 16:02.586
‐[both laugh]
‐Three. All right.

16:02.669 --> 16:04.755
‐[Darcie] Thank you so much.
‐Of course.

16:04.838 --> 16:05.964
‐Nice meeting you.
‐You, too.

16:08.926 --> 16:11.512
‐She's got good taste.
‐Oh, shut up.

16:11.595 --> 16:12.179
[laughs]

16:15.516 --> 16:16.975
‐Hey.
‐So?

16:18.685 --> 16:19.478
I passed.

16:19.561 --> 16:21.939
‐I knew it. I knew you would.
‐Yes!

16:22.022 --> 16:23.232
[chuckles]
Yeah.

16:23.315 --> 16:25.484
All right, well,
you know what that means.

16:25.567 --> 16:26.610
What? What do you mean?

16:26.693 --> 16:28.237
Anywhere you want to go.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.489
Really?

16:30.572 --> 16:31.323
‐Yeah.
‐Yeah.

16:31.406 --> 16:33.951
[laughs]
Okay.

16:34.034 --> 16:35.619
‐Okay, sweet. Let's go.
‐[Quiara] Let's do it.

16:35.702 --> 16:37.704
‐Ready?
‐Yes.

16:37.788 --> 16:39.123
All right, honey, let's go.

16:39.206 --> 16:39.581
[Alice]
<i>You should've seen</i>

16:39.665 --> 16:40.499
their faces.

16:40.582 --> 16:43.127
They were, like...

16:43.210 --> 16:45.337
you know, shocked but guilty.
You know that look?

16:45.420 --> 16:47.631
Mm‐hmm.

16:47.714 --> 16:49.800
Why didn't she just tell me?

16:49.883 --> 16:51.885
It's not like I'm gossipy.

16:52.886 --> 16:54.138
I'm not.

16:54.221 --> 16:55.180
That's just my persona.

16:55.264 --> 16:57.599
She was probably just scared.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.977
‐Of what?
‐[Nat] You know,

17:00.060 --> 17:03.647
sometimes, in life,
we avoid the people

17:03.730 --> 17:06.024
who are gonna tell us the truth.

17:07.734 --> 17:10.320
Okay. This isn't helping.

17:10.404 --> 17:12.823
Hey. You're a really
good friend to her.

17:12.906 --> 17:14.533
‐Yeah.
‐Thank you.

17:14.616 --> 17:16.660
‐Yeah, you are.
‐Thank you.

17:16.743 --> 17:18.287
You're amazing.
I'm sorry.

17:18.370 --> 17:21.373
Y'all are making me
so homesick.

17:21.456 --> 17:25.002
I wish my best friends
lived in L. A. [chuckles]

17:25.085 --> 17:27.588
We're not friends.

17:28.755 --> 17:30.424
[Toni]
Oh.

17:30.507 --> 17:31.925
Okay.

17:32.009 --> 17:32.926
Wow.
[laughs softly]

17:33.010 --> 17:34.261
Um. Are y'all ready
for the check?

17:34.344 --> 17:35.846
‐Yeah, check would be awesome.
‐[Nat] You know what?

17:35.929 --> 17:37.681
I think we're gonna
need a minute.

17:37.764 --> 17:39.016
Okay, I'll just be back

17:39.099 --> 17:40.559
in a sec, then. Yeah.

17:40.642 --> 17:41.810
I love your show.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.687
Oh, thank you.

17:43.770 --> 17:46.064
Ugh, great.

17:49.526 --> 17:51.236
What did I do?

17:56.742 --> 17:58.368
That's new.

17:58.452 --> 17:59.995
I like it.

18:00.078 --> 18:02.164
Oh. Thanks.

18:02.247 --> 18:04.082
Got it a couple months ago
at Fahey/Klein.

18:04.166 --> 18:05.542
I miss that place.

18:05.626 --> 18:07.377
[chuckles softly]

18:07.461 --> 18:09.379
[phones chiming]

18:09.463 --> 18:12.633
‐Oh, thank God.
‐[chuckles] She passed.

18:12.716 --> 18:14.426
She probably would've blamed me
if she hadn't.

18:14.510 --> 18:16.595
You know, I hated
teaching her.

18:16.678 --> 18:18.597
I just panicked the whole time.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.891
She got so mad when I was
teaching how to parallel park

18:20.974 --> 18:22.267
that she actually made me
get out of the car

18:22.351 --> 18:24.394
and watch her do it from the
other side of the parking lot.

18:24.478 --> 18:27.523
[laughs] Oh, my God,
she is so much like you.

18:27.606 --> 18:28.732
You, too.

18:28.815 --> 18:31.109
[sighs]

18:32.194 --> 18:36.698
I hope we haven't
screwed her up entirely.

18:36.782 --> 18:39.034
I mean me.
I hope I haven't

18:39.117 --> 18:41.828
just screwed her up.

18:41.912 --> 18:44.164
You're a good mom.

18:46.500 --> 18:49.002
So are you.

18:56.468 --> 19:00.514
I'm just glad that you were able
to create so much space for her.

19:00.597 --> 19:02.516
Of course.

19:02.599 --> 19:04.434
[chuckles]

19:04.518 --> 19:06.603
What?

19:06.687 --> 19:09.022
Nothing. You just...

19:09.106 --> 19:11.608
That doesn't
come natural to you.

19:11.692 --> 19:12.943
What are you saying?

19:13.026 --> 19:16.029
You could never do that for me.

19:16.113 --> 19:18.782
You just...

19:18.865 --> 19:22.911
took up so much space.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.121
[exhales]

19:24.204 --> 19:28.166
You know, for as long
as I can remember,

19:28.250 --> 19:30.294
I've been able
to identify what I want

19:30.377 --> 19:32.296
and I've been willing
to pursue it.

19:32.379 --> 19:33.839
Do you really think
I should apologize for that?

19:33.922 --> 19:36.508
I'm not asking you to apologize.

19:36.592 --> 19:38.802
But I definitely put
your career first,

19:38.885 --> 19:41.263
your feelings first‐‐

19:41.346 --> 19:43.432
I never asked you to do that.

19:43.515 --> 19:45.976
You didn't have to.
Everything was on your timeline,

19:46.059 --> 19:47.394
on your terms.

19:47.477 --> 19:48.645
I don't think that's fair.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.856
[chuckles]
Of course you don't.

19:50.939 --> 19:52.983
Because you're never wrong.

19:53.066 --> 19:54.151
Look around.

19:54.234 --> 19:58.447
I am wrong
all the fucking time.

20:02.242 --> 20:05.454
Are you still seeing that woman?

20:07.914 --> 20:10.542
I broke up with her yesterday.

20:10.626 --> 20:13.003
Before any of this
even happened.

20:13.086 --> 20:16.298
Just should've done it sooner.

20:16.381 --> 20:17.674
That would have been helpful.

20:20.260 --> 20:23.930
You know, Felicity was there
for me when Kit died.

20:24.014 --> 20:26.266
I wish I could've been there.

20:26.350 --> 20:29.144
You could have at least come
to the funeral.

20:29.227 --> 20:32.439
I would have made it harder
for you.

20:32.522 --> 20:33.857
I was trying to protect you.

20:33.940 --> 20:36.276
How was that protecting me?

20:36.360 --> 20:37.569
We had just
gotten divorced.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.404
I had just left.

20:39.488 --> 20:43.116
It would have been very
confusing if I had shown up.

20:43.742 --> 20:45.994
Such a bullshit excuse.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.996
We needed that space.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.665
You needed that space.

20:50.248 --> 20:53.585
I needed that space.

20:55.128 --> 20:57.297
You should have been there.

20:59.132 --> 21:01.927
I thought you were my family.
