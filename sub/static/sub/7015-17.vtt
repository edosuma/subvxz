WEBVTT

00:07.647 --> 00:11.982
Okay, I don't understand why you're
taking a video camera on a road trip.

00:12.010 --> 00:14.833
You should be packing
more sensible items, like

00:14.876 --> 00:17.200
toilet paper
and your mother.

00:17.616 --> 00:21.371
Look, mom, accept it. I'm going.
Okay, my year off is now officially over,

00:21.399 --> 00:26.334
and I think I've finally decided on a sensible career
that's gonna provide me with a really stable future.

00:26.377 --> 00:29.059
I'm gonna be a traveling
documentary filmmaker.

00:30.723 --> 00:34.110
Oh, come on.
You made that up.

00:35.344 --> 00:39.432
Hey, Kitty, I'm going
ice skating on a rainbow!

00:41.024 --> 00:43.047
Eric, don't listen to him.

00:43.090 --> 00:47.921
I have complete confidence you're gonna be
the best traveling docu-whatsit-who-maker ever.

00:48.265 --> 00:49.227
Thank you.

00:49.757 --> 00:51.292
Do you have
enough money?

00:51.335 --> 00:53.071
Mom, I don't need
that much money.

00:53.114 --> 00:54.844
I'm sure that at
stops along the way,

00:54.891 --> 00:59.191
strangers will just offer me hot pots of beans
in exchange for colorful stories from the road.

01:00.905 --> 01:03.186
Hot pots of beans?

01:04.275 --> 01:07.633
What if they're spicy? You can't
even chew cinnamon gum.

01:09.023 --> 01:12.638
Okay, that's it. I'm going.
Uh, I'll miss you.

01:12.782 --> 01:14.302
Well, thank you, sweetie.

01:16.540 --> 01:19.265
Um, I think he was
talking to me.

01:20.026 --> 01:21.451
He was not.

01:23.661 --> 01:25.884
Eric, who were
you talking to?

01:26.529 --> 01:27.734
Yeah, who?

01:28.825 --> 01:31.722
It's times like this
I usually fake chest pains.

01:34.462 --> 01:37.419
Uh, I was talking to...

01:39.011 --> 01:42.325
the prettiest girl
in the driveway, that's who.

01:44.634 --> 01:45.839
So, okay,

01:46.396 --> 01:49.538
I want you to promise to
call me every night at 9:00.

01:49.580 --> 01:52.808
Oh, he can't be calling you
because he's calling me at 9:00.

01:52.865 --> 01:54.744
That's why I got him
that watch as a gift.

01:54.787 --> 01:59.974
Well, maybe he should be calling the
person who gave him the gift of life.

02:01.581 --> 02:04.995
So you squeezed out a baby.
That was a hundred years ago.

02:06.099 --> 02:08.925
People have landed
on the moon since then.

02:09.770 --> 02:10.860
Hey, Eric,

02:11.569 --> 02:15.126
I'm gonna miss you, man.
Hey, uh, just between friends,

02:15.169 --> 02:17.880
I want you to know I'm gonna
take a shot or two at Donna.

02:18.870 --> 02:20.548
He won't care.

02:20.591 --> 02:25.067
On the road, he's going to meet
lots of horny girl hitchhikers

02:25.647 --> 02:28.229
looking for a ride
to cheerleading camp.

02:30.783 --> 02:33.365
What makes you
think that, Fez?

02:33.494 --> 02:34.885
Adult films.

02:42.010 --> 02:42.870
Oh.

02:43.229 --> 02:45.639
Hello, America,
and welcome

02:45.811 --> 02:47.489
to Eric Forman's

02:47.547 --> 02:49.140
journey to happiness,

02:49.198 --> 02:51.794
not to be mistaken
with Eric Forman's

02:51.823 --> 02:53.214
journey to fatso burger

02:53.257 --> 02:57.675
or Eric Forman's journey to pee
behind the piggly wiggly, which, uh,

02:57.733 --> 02:59.853
which you just
saw earlier.

03:00.814 --> 03:03.296
I'll tell ya, being on
the road like this

03:04.300 --> 03:05.906
really makes you
feel like a man.

Ahem.
I guess I'll just

03:16.822 --> 03:19.131
have to edit that
part out later.

03:24.423 --> 03:29.687
Okay, I think what we've learned today is
that the road can be a cruel, cruel mistress.

03:29.730 --> 03:32.026
She caresses your tire with her...

03:32.255 --> 03:34.636
asphalt hand one minute,

03:35.236 --> 03:36.943
punctures it the next.

03:37.087 --> 03:37.919
But, hey,

03:38.119 --> 03:40.788
at least that didn't stop me from
making it out of Point Place.

03:48.482 --> 03:53.416
I think what we've learned today is that the
road can be a cruel, cruel mistress. Oh hey,

03:53.732 --> 03:56.644
at least that didn't stop me
from making it out of Point Place.

You know, Steven, it's great
we can still hang out.

04:39.434 --> 04:41.112
We're kinda like
Sonny and Cher.

04:41.155 --> 04:43.407
We're together even though
we've broken up.

04:43.608 --> 04:45.805
I'm beautiful.
You're weird-looking.

04:47.583 --> 04:49.821
Look, they're talking.
Maybe we should..

05:07.417 --> 05:09.511
Okay,
we're going upstairs.

05:10.071 --> 05:10.951
Why?

05:11.248 --> 05:15.839
Uh, uh, I just remembered that I- I can't
be in the basement 'cause

05:15.867 --> 05:18.406
I'm uncomfortable
below sea level.

05:22.078 --> 05:24.172
That's the best
you can come up with?

05:24.688 --> 05:27.127
Just say that we're
going to take a shower.

05:36.216 --> 05:37.119
Wow.

05:38.252 --> 05:40.878
You know, I think this is the
first time we've been alone

05:40.921 --> 05:42.599
together since, uh...

05:43.287 --> 05:44.105
yeah.

05:46.587 --> 05:50.137
Well, maybe we can use this opportunity
to touch base about our feelings.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.912
- Or we can watch TV.
- Great! Oh, I love TV.

06:02.479 --> 06:03.598
<i>Oh, Janie,</i>

06:03.857 --> 06:06.123
<i>it's so hard to be in
the same room with you,</i>

06:06.180 --> 06:08.576
<i>because even though
I'm a rough ne'er-do-well,</i>

06:08.605 --> 06:12.011
<i>my love for you burns like
a fire deep in my soul.</i>

06:12.047 --> 06:13.926
<i>I feel the same, Clyde,</i>

06:13.948 --> 06:16.572
<i>and even though we broke up
because you won't marry me,</i>

06:16.595 --> 06:19.449
<i>I still hope that one day
we'll get back together.</i>

06:20.846 --> 06:22.408
What are the chances of that?

06:28.280 --> 06:29.888
Greetings, gentle viewer.

06:30.276 --> 06:31.849
Road trip update.

06:32.213 --> 06:34.785
About to change
a flat tire, which, uh,

06:35.055 --> 06:36.593
actually reminds
me of a little joke.

06:36.663 --> 06:40.127
How many psychiatrists does it take
to change a flat tire? Well,

06:40.162 --> 06:42.651
see, first, the tire
has to really wanna change.

06:44.107 --> 06:44.929
Good one.

06:45.094 --> 06:48.849
Anyway, what do you say we, uh,
slap a spare tire on this sucker, huh?

06:51.022 --> 06:53.546
It turns out there
is no spare tire.

06:57.022 --> 06:57.949
and, uh, I-

06:58.898 --> 07:01.188
it's, like, pitch
dark out here.

07:01.986 --> 07:03.372
hello?! Hello?!

07:04.910 --> 07:07.669
Okay, there's definitely someone
out there, and, uh,

07:07.998 --> 07:12.246
I don't know who, but I think it's a pretty safe bet to say
that it's probably a convict with a hook for a hand. Hello?!

07:12.434 --> 07:16.544
Okay, buddy, you come one step
closer, I got a tire iron,

07:16.720 --> 07:19.150
and I'll just give it
to you if you'll go away.

07:20.638 --> 07:21.788
Hey, dude.

07:26.227 --> 07:28.258
What are you
doing here, man?

07:28.305 --> 07:30.489
Leo, what are
you doing here?

07:30.924 --> 07:33.811
It's like the universe wanted
us to find each other, man.

07:33.847 --> 07:34.598
Yeah.

07:35.561 --> 07:36.265
So

07:36.723 --> 07:38.355
do I know you, man?

07:46.329 --> 07:48.642
So they're a family
of monsters?

07:48.783 --> 07:51.307
No, they're munsters.

07:53.265 --> 07:56.142
And they're living in a
neighborhood of normal people.

07:56.846 --> 08:00.615
Why don't the neighbors just get together with
some guns and go over there and kill them?

08:01.602 --> 08:04.329
I'm pretty sure they're saving
that for the last episode.

08:06.301 --> 08:07.734
It's 9:15.

08:07.769 --> 08:09.025
Has Eric called?

08:09.260 --> 08:11.151
- He didn't call you?
- No.

08:11.174 --> 08:15.306
I thought sure he would call you.
He's always choosing you over me.

08:15.987 --> 08:17.619
Name one time.

08:18.277 --> 08:19.451
Prom night.

08:22.175 --> 08:26.158
Okay, I haven't heard from him, and I'm starting
to think something bad happened to him.

08:26.944 --> 08:28.788
Red, we have to
go look for him.

08:28.823 --> 08:31.312
Fine. Anything's better
than this crap.

08:32.134 --> 08:34.986
Who wants to see
monsters not get killed?

08:43.215 --> 08:44.459
- Did you ever see the new...
- Have you seen the new...

08:45.915 --> 08:46.934
Go ahead.

08:47.345 --> 08:48.672
- See, the other day I...
- I saw...

08:50.292 --> 08:51.408
You said, "go ahead."

08:51.513 --> 08:53.216
Yeah, I said it to be nice.

08:54.719 --> 08:57.336
My story is much
more interesting.

08:58.087 --> 09:00.248
Well, go ahead, because
I'm not gonna listen.

09:01.022 --> 09:03.265
Well, fine, then,'cause
I'm not gonna tell you.

09:06.740 --> 09:10.485
Oh, it's as quiet as a basement
with two former lovers in it.

09:13.879 --> 09:15.992
I can eat the tension
with a fork.

09:20.054 --> 09:22.450
Wouldn't you cut the
tension with a knife?

09:23.600 --> 09:25.326
Why cut it if you're
not gonna eat it?

09:25.884 --> 09:27.892
No, no, Fez, stay. Stay.

09:27.983 --> 09:32.234
Why don't you tell us one of those charming
little stories about your, um, homeland?

09:32.340 --> 09:35.522
Well, in my country, instead
of bathrooms, we just...

09:35.557 --> 09:37.905
he doesn't wanna stay
down here with us.

09:38.281 --> 09:40.031
How would you
know what he wants?

09:40.054 --> 09:41.697
You don't know
what anybody wants.

09:42.131 --> 09:43.540
Oh, this is so sad.

09:44.597 --> 09:47.415
You're at each other's throats
because of these unresolved feelings.

09:47.450 --> 09:48.951
What? No.

09:48.987 --> 09:51.335
Fez, there are
no unresolved feelings.

09:51.358 --> 09:53.319
Really?
Then why are you so tense?

09:53.660 --> 09:55.081
Why is your foot tapping?

09:57.617 --> 09:59.012
Why is your foot tapping?

09:59.329 --> 10:01.407
Because I got
rhythm, baby.

10:02.123 --> 10:04.237
I can never stop
dancing entirely.

10:13.985 --> 10:16.744
You know what, Leo? This is
my first truck stop, and I love it.

10:17.036 --> 10:17.870
It's like,

10:18.187 --> 10:20.582
How do you find
this golden oasis?

10:21.674 --> 10:23.952
I woke up in the
parking lot once.

10:27.216 --> 10:31.404
And these truckers, they're like... they seem like
great salt of the earth guys, you know?

10:32.120 --> 10:32.942
Hey!

10:33.588 --> 10:35.878
Ten-four, good buddies!

10:36.277 --> 10:38.315
Oh, oh, crap, they're looking at me.

10:38.996 --> 10:41.168
No, they're looking at me, man.

10:41.438 --> 10:44.198
Truckers love me.
They think I'm Bob Seger.

10:46.687 --> 10:49.870
You know what? These guys would be
the perfect people to interview for my movie.

10:50.328 --> 10:52.570
- Where's your camera?
- Ah, it's so heavy.

10:54.754 --> 10:56.959
So, uh, Leo, what have you been
doing since you left town?

10:56.994 --> 11:00.763
Ah, just wandering around,
trying to find my place in life.

11:00.810 --> 11:03.382
Yeah, I've been trying to find my
place in life, too. It's like,

11:03.793 --> 11:06.058
you know, like,
where do I fit in?

11:06.140 --> 11:08.324
No, I've been looking
for my house, man.

11:11.283 --> 11:12.997
Boys, need anything else?

11:13.033 --> 11:18.069
Uh, no, we're just waiting for the mechanic I met in the
parking lot to come back with my spare tire and change.

11:18.116 --> 11:20.593
Honey, there's no
mechanic around here.

11:21.685 --> 11:23.456
Uh, no, there is.

11:23.491 --> 11:26.837
it's this skinny guy. I gave him
20 bucks, and he just ran off.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.045
That'd be Earl.

11:29.068 --> 11:30.348
He's a speed freak.

11:31.838 --> 11:34.433
Oh, my god. Leo, that
was my last 20 bucks.

11:34.538 --> 11:36.229
It's okay, man.
Dinner's on me.

11:36.265 --> 11:37.310
Oh, thanks. You'll pay?

11:37.345 --> 11:39.869
No, I mean, I got
spaghetti sauce all over me.

11:41.912 --> 11:42.559
Leo,

11:43.005 --> 11:45.412
look, be serious, man.
What are we gonna do?

11:46.081 --> 11:47.021
I got it.

11:47.514 --> 11:49.874
We'll soak the shirt
in club soda.

11:58.101 --> 11:58.876
Okay,

11:59.545 --> 12:03.455
I'm gonna use my police academy training
to figure out what happened here.

12:04.594 --> 12:09.992
First thing I'm gonna need is for everyone to
lie face down with your hands behind your head.

12:11.624 --> 12:15.875
What if he stopped to take a picture
and he got kidnapped by white slavers?

12:16.990 --> 12:20.658
They're gonna kill him.
He can't do anything!

12:22.196 --> 12:24.861
I told him this
was a stupid idea,

12:24.955 --> 12:27.867
and now we're stuck out
here in the middle of nowhere.

12:27.926 --> 12:31.942
My foot is shaking, it wants
to kick his ass so bad.

12:34.126 --> 12:36.368
I never should have
let Eric go on this trip.

12:36.415 --> 12:39.269
I should have tempted him into
staying home by offering him sex.

12:42.785 --> 12:44.334
I mean, Scrabble.

12:45.849 --> 12:49.771
Oh, look, if my baby being
safe depended on you being loose,

12:49.830 --> 12:51.484
I wouldn't have to worry.

12:53.962 --> 12:54.655
Okay.

12:55.124 --> 12:57.238
I think it's obvious
what happened to Eric.

12:57.882 --> 12:59.631
We got an abandoned car,

13:00.066 --> 13:01.569
a flat tire

13:01.815 --> 13:05.291
and footprints heading
off in that direction.

13:06.136 --> 13:07.052
Mrs. Forman,

13:07.194 --> 13:09.496
your son's been
kidnapped by coyotes.

13:11.093 --> 13:16.271
Isn't it more likely that he had a flat tire, couldn't
change it himself and went off to find some help?

13:16.529 --> 13:18.665
And the coyotes
got him along the way.

13:19.698 --> 13:21.847
Yeah, now you're
thinking like a cop.

13:28.373 --> 13:31.496
I can't believe I'm stuckin a backwoods
truck stop with no money.

13:32.658 --> 13:36.251
You know, if we don't do something, this waitress is
just gonna hand us over to these truckers.

13:37.249 --> 13:40.173
You know, they're all
freaky sexual deviants.

13:41.629 --> 13:45.081
Man, woman, animal...
they don't care, as long as it's warm.

13:46.560 --> 13:49.912
Don't worry, man. I've got an idea
how we can pay for this dinner.

13:51.920 --> 13:54.245
That was a good idea.

13:55.337 --> 13:57.697
Now how are we
gonna pay for dinner?

13:58.437 --> 14:01.239
I think this pretty
much covers your tab.

14:02.049 --> 14:04.797
But if you're interested,
dessert's on me.

14:06.805 --> 14:08.566
In that case,

14:08.613 --> 14:11.357
you'd better soak
your uniform in club soda.

14:12.673 --> 14:13.659
You see?

14:13.776 --> 14:15.291
What an
awesome night.

14:15.338 --> 14:17.931
I am partying in the back
of a truck stop with a

14:17.966 --> 14:19.516
a hippie and a waitress...

14:20.596 --> 14:22.099
who are now making out.

14:22.933 --> 14:26.535
Wow, the fact that I'm here
is not slowing them down at all.

14:27.252 --> 14:30.246
Good god, woman, you buttered
my toast with that hand!

14:31.326 --> 14:34.341
Okay, enough pussy
footing around...

14:36.056 --> 14:39.085
which, by the way, does not
mean what I thought it meant.

14:41.140 --> 14:42.979
Why don't you just
get back together?

14:43.002 --> 14:45.996
You know you want to. I don't even know
why you broke up in the first place.

14:46.583 --> 14:51.069
Because he's an incredibly immature jerk
who can't commit to a future with me.

14:51.174 --> 14:53.652
What she said,
but I agree with me.

14:55.707 --> 14:56.984
Nice rebuttal...

14:57.748 --> 15:00.730
which, by the way, also does not
mean what I thought it meant.

15:02.339 --> 15:03.900
It's hopeless, okay?

15:03.947 --> 15:06.578
We both wanted different
things out of the relationship.

15:06.801 --> 15:08.868
You just have to
remember the good times,

15:08.903 --> 15:10.958
the things that
brought you together.

15:11.381 --> 15:14.257
Jackie, what are some of the things
that Hyde did that you miss?

15:14.786 --> 15:17.298
He never did anything
a boyfriend's supposed to do.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.365
He never bought me a horse.

15:20.962 --> 15:21.748
Okay?

15:21.807 --> 15:25.083
He never rented a plane
to spell "I love you" in the sky.

15:25.271 --> 15:27.822
Oh, and he never even
wrote me a single song.

15:28.972 --> 15:31.743
How would you know? You never stop
talking long enough to listen.

15:33.528 --> 15:35.195
Wait, you wrote me a song?

15:35.310 --> 15:36.144
No.

15:37.353 --> 15:39.995
Okay, okay, okay.
Let's try something else.

15:40.183 --> 15:44.116
I want you to think back. Obviously, there
was something that brought you together.

15:44.293 --> 15:45.318
What was that?

15:46.586 --> 15:48.300
Well, I guess...

15:48.488 --> 15:52.351
I guess I like the way his scruffy
beard felt on my soft, creamy,

15:52.386 --> 15:53.851
porcelain skin.

15:57.033 --> 15:58.665
Yeah, I kinda
liked that, too.

16:00.450 --> 16:03.472
I also kinda like the fact that she
was technically still with Kelso.

16:06.983 --> 16:10.294
And I knew being with
him would piss off my mom.

16:10.998 --> 16:12.114
And all my friends.

16:12.149 --> 16:14.281
Oh, and we had
to keep it a secret.

16:14.997 --> 16:16.770
And I felt kind of
ashamed of myself.

16:17.205 --> 16:18.543
So did I.

16:20.352 --> 16:21.667
I kinda liked that, too.

16:22.111 --> 16:23.790
So did I!

16:24.776 --> 16:26.772
Oh, that's just so wrong.

16:27.770 --> 16:30.271
Which is what
made it so hot.

16:32.687 --> 16:33.838
So hot.

16:35.529 --> 16:37.466
Oh, Fez, you should
have been there.

16:39.944 --> 16:41.364
Several times I was.

16:51.122 --> 16:52.543
All right, listen,

16:52.954 --> 16:56.147
this type of establishment
is well known to criminals, okay?

16:56.183 --> 16:58.942
So I want you to stay close,
and if there's any trouble,

16:59.083 --> 17:01.057
I'm gonna use you guys
as a human shield.

17:05.844 --> 17:07.992
I don't like the looks
of these people.

17:08.932 --> 17:14.189
They seem like they could tease a polite young man about
his sweater and then laugh when he starts to cry.

17:15.375 --> 17:16.901
Where is my baby?

17:17.675 --> 17:19.564
See, that's the problem.

17:19.858 --> 17:23.709
Maybe if you didn't baby Eric so much, he
wouldn't have had to leave to prove himself.

17:23.756 --> 17:27.807
Well, maybe if you hadn't exhausted
him with your sexual demands,

17:28.640 --> 17:31.259
he wouldn't have had to leave
just to get some sleep.

17:31.811 --> 17:34.476
All right, that's
enough, you two.

17:34.699 --> 17:36.625
If Eric's in trouble,
he deserves it,

17:36.660 --> 17:38.925
because he should
know better by now.

17:39.724 --> 17:42.072
You sound like
you don't care at all.

17:42.107 --> 17:44.115
It's not a matter
of not caring.

17:44.162 --> 17:46.346
It's a matter
of not giving a crap.

17:48.741 --> 17:49.443
Hey, Red,

17:49.960 --> 17:52.649
they got "Rhinestone cowboy."
Toss me a quarter.

17:54.339 --> 17:55.337
Shut up.

17:57.240 --> 17:58.660
For your information,

17:58.702 --> 18:01.731
Eric comes after me a
lot more than I go after him.

18:02.705 --> 18:05.218
You know, all you
damn redheads are the same.

18:06.486 --> 18:09.539
You can color it blond,
but it's still there.

18:14.436 --> 18:16.291
Well, it turns out

18:16.726 --> 18:19.626
I have a couple of problems with
being a traveling documentary filmmaker.

18:20.201 --> 18:21.046
One...

18:21.692 --> 18:23.195
The traveling.
It's exhausting.

18:25.215 --> 18:25.954
Two...

18:26.295 --> 18:28.995
Documentaries.
I only like ones that are...

18:29.946 --> 18:31.437
You know,
about monkeys.

18:32.693 --> 18:33.374
And three...

18:33.468 --> 18:35.969
Filmmaking. If there's no
space battles, I mean,

18:36.392 --> 18:37.848
you know, really,
what's the point?

18:39.046 --> 18:41.382
I'll tell you something.
This day has not been a waste.

18:41.500 --> 18:44.001
I realized what I really
wanna do with my life

18:44.694 --> 18:46.831
is just get the hell
out of Point Place.

18:48.393 --> 18:49.755
I'm ready to do that.

18:51.128 --> 18:52.805
I really feel
like this trip

18:53.451 --> 18:54.695
made me a man.

18:55.012 --> 18:56.456
- Eric?!
- Mommy?

18:57.525 --> 18:59.063
Thank god
you're okay.

18:59.098 --> 19:01.573
- Oh, dad, I'm fine.
- Not you. The car.

19:04.004 --> 19:06.047
Eric, your mom
called me a whore.

19:06.796 --> 19:11.298
Only because I was worried about you
and because I love you more than she does.

19:11.738 --> 19:12.537
Worried? What...

19:12.887 --> 19:14.472
What did you guys
think happened?

19:14.519 --> 19:16.855
Well, we figured you
were either dead,

19:16.891 --> 19:19.568
alive or kidnapped
by coyotes.

19:20.754 --> 19:22.654
Looks like I was
right on the money.

19:23.323 --> 19:25.554
Hey, I got that
waitress's phone number.

19:25.601 --> 19:26.658
- Leo?
- Leo?

19:26.705 --> 19:28.947
Hey, it's great
to see you guys.

19:28.994 --> 19:30.953
It's great to
see you, Leo.

19:31.493 --> 19:33.195
So do I know you, man?

19:39.017 --> 19:40.356
Okay, here's
what I think.

19:40.790 --> 19:45.146
You two were hot for each other when the
relationship was secret, forbidden, taboo.

19:46.426 --> 19:48.880
But when it was out in the
open, the thrill was gone.

19:48.903 --> 19:50.833
It was no longer taboo.

19:52.442 --> 19:56.023
Then you started pushing for commitment,
and you started pulling away.

20:01.611 --> 20:02.339
Hmm.

20:02.984 --> 20:04.851
So how do we
move on from here?

20:05.016 --> 20:05.767
Move on?

20:07.552 --> 20:09.190
There will be no moving on.

20:09.976 --> 20:13.452
Your relationship is one of the sickest
freakin' things I've ever seen.

20:13.851 --> 20:16.763
You're two deeply disturbed
individuals, and your union...

20:16.810 --> 20:18.860
well, your union
was a blasphemy.

20:21.455 --> 20:24.355
So you're saying that if
we hooked up again,

20:24.989 --> 20:26.844
it'd be even wronger
than before?

20:28.523 --> 20:30.472
It can get wronger?

20:33.818 --> 20:35.380
Well, that's kinda hot.

20:37.282 --> 20:39.524
Fez, I think maybe you should
leave the room now.

20:39.630 --> 20:43.152
Oh, no, no, you two cannot get together.
I can't watch. I'm leaving.

20:45.724 --> 20:47.050
Hey, who am I kidding?

20:47.849 --> 20:49.317
I can watch all night.

20:55.099 --> 20:55.968
Hey.

20:56.250 --> 20:58.293
Look who I found
by the side of the road.

20:58.586 --> 20:59.302
Leo.

20:59.866 --> 21:01.592
Man, what are you doing
back in town?

21:01.627 --> 21:03.553
I'm not really sure, man.

21:04.492 --> 21:07.052
Yeah, I can't tell
if he has amnesia,

21:07.251 --> 21:09.142
or if he's just
perfectly fine.

21:10.868 --> 21:12.371
Well, I'm glad
you're back, man.

21:12.511 --> 21:14.384
Feeling's mutual, man.

21:15.089 --> 21:16.498
Hey, wait a second.

21:16.662 --> 21:18.165
You're Hyde, man.

21:19.128 --> 21:19.868
Hey!
