00:41.185 --> 00:43.838
We can put the presents
in the drawing room

00:43.882 --> 00:46.448
against the window.
Very good, m'lady.

00:46.491 --> 00:49.187
I suppose we do have to
display all the presents.

00:49.231 --> 00:51.970
It can look rather greedy.

00:52.014 --> 00:56.754
I can't bear the disruption we've
brought on your heads. Don't be silly.

01:00.624 --> 01:05.058
How are you feeling? I just wish I could
get rid of this damn stick. Sorry.

01:05.059 --> 01:07.712
Don't be. If anyone has a
right to swear, it's you.

01:07.756 --> 01:10.452
Don't bully yourself.

01:10.496 --> 01:14.800
Think of where we were a few months
ago and smile. I quite agree.

01:14.844 --> 01:18.845
I want to make it up and down that
aisle without assistance. Up, yes.

01:18.889 --> 01:21.410
You'll have me to lean on coming
down.

01:21.497 --> 01:26.063
You still have three full days
of practice so never say die.

01:26.107 --> 01:29.021
My goodness, is that the time?

01:29.064 --> 01:32.020
I must be getting back.
I'll go with you.

01:32.064 --> 01:36.195
She's just sucking up, Mother.
Any bride who doesn't suck up

01:36.239 --> 01:39.892
to her husband's mother is a fool.

01:46.285 --> 01:48.327
Can I bother you?

01:48.328 --> 01:53.025
Mrs Bryant has written a letter
I did not expect.

01:53.069 --> 01:56.938
She says her husband wants to see
the baby. They both do.

01:56.982 --> 02:00.504
Isn't that what you hoped?
Yes and no.

02:00.548 --> 02:03.635
Remember what he was like last time?
I don't want to

02:03.679 --> 02:06.723
build up Ethel's hopes again.
Ethel's not important.

02:06.767 --> 02:11.333
It's the boy's chances you have to
look to. I believe you're right,

02:11.375 --> 02:14.376
though we come at it by different
routes.

02:15.464 --> 02:17.812
Why announce it tonight,
all of a sudden?

02:17.855 --> 02:20.160
He's got a job at a newspaper.

02:20.204 --> 02:23.117
He heard today, it's a real chance.

02:23.160 --> 02:27.726
Let him go to Dublin then you can
use the calm to consider.

02:27.770 --> 02:30.641
Mary doesn't want you
to be trapped before

02:30.683 --> 02:33.554
you're completely sure.
But I am sure!

02:33.598 --> 02:37.859
How many times do I have to say it?!
Anna, tell them!

02:37.902 --> 02:41.033
Lady Mary's right.

02:41.077 --> 02:44.686
It's a big thing, to give up
your whole world. Thank you.

02:44.730 --> 02:48.947
Listen to her if you won't listen
to me. I'm not giving up my world!

02:49.035 --> 02:52.079
If they give me up,
that's their affair!

02:52.122 --> 02:55.254
I'm perfectly happy to carry on
being friends with everyone.

02:55.296 --> 02:58.688
Married to the chauffer? Yes.

02:58.732 --> 03:04.037
Anyway, he's a journalist now,
which sounds better for granny.

03:04.081 --> 03:06.777
We're going to tell papa tonight.

03:08.125 --> 03:12.213
We? You mean, you and Branson?

03:12.256 --> 03:15.386
He's coming in after dinner.

03:15.387 --> 03:19.344
What will papa do?
I imagine he'll call the police.

03:20.997 --> 03:24.389
Downton is not a hostel.
No, Mr Carson.

03:24.433 --> 03:26.955
You made such a point
of not being a servant

03:26.998 --> 03:29.434
any more, our ears
are ringing with it.

03:29.476 --> 03:32.521
Trouble is, I'm a little out
of pocket at the moment.

03:32.564 --> 03:35.565
I cannot say that
I'm sympathetic

03:35.609 --> 03:38.566
when you dabble in the black market.

03:41.261 --> 03:44.306
I just need some more time,
Mr Carson.

03:44.349 --> 03:48.698
How long is it since the last
patient left, Sergeant?

03:48.742 --> 03:54.656
You're trespassing on our generosity.
I'll try to make myself useful.

03:54.699 --> 03:57.221
Just find somewhere to go.

04:09.136 --> 04:11.658
Yes?

04:11.702 --> 04:14.485
I'm here. So I can see.

04:18.572 --> 04:21.399
It's not such a good idea.
We mustn't worry granny.

04:21.442 --> 04:24.313
You asked me to
come and I've come.

04:24.356 --> 04:27.400
Would someone please tell
me what is going on or

04:27.444 --> 04:30.487
have we all stepped through
the looking glass?

04:30.531 --> 04:34.793
Your grandmother has as much right
to know as anybody else.

04:34.837 --> 04:37.098
Why don't I find that reassuring?

04:37.141 --> 04:41.316
How much longer is Mr Carson
going to be? It's never worth

04:41.360 --> 04:45.229
trying to make food interesting
in the servants hall.

04:45.273 --> 04:47.404
You're very quiet this evening.

04:47.447 --> 04:50.187
I've had a letter off Mr
Mason, William's dad.

04:50.230 --> 04:53.013
Yes. What does he want?

04:53.014 --> 04:58.710
To see me. You're his daughter-in-law,
why shouldn't he see you?

04:58.754 --> 05:03.842
I wish it were as simple. I think
it is but I'll not reopen the wound.

05:03.885 --> 05:08.191
'What do you mean, you knew?'
I hoped it would blow over.

05:08.234 --> 05:11.104
I didn't want to split
the family when Sybil

05:11.147 --> 05:13.931
might still wake up.
You've driven me about,

05:13.974 --> 05:17.018
bowing and scraping and seducing
my daughter behind my back?!

05:17.061 --> 05:20.018
I don't bow and scrape and
I've not seduced her.

05:20.062 --> 05:22.671
Give your daughter some credit
for knowing her own mind.

05:22.715 --> 05:25.324
How dare you use that tone!

05:25.454 --> 05:28.890
You will leave at once!
Papa! This is a folly!

05:28.933 --> 05:33.847
A ridiculous, juvenile madness!
Sybil, what do you have in mind?

05:33.890 --> 05:38.065
Mama, this is hardly... No,
she must have something in mind.

05:38.152 --> 05:41.805
Otherwise she wouldn't have summoned
him here tonight.

05:41.848 --> 05:44.980
Thank you, Granny.
Yes, we do have a plan.

05:45.023 --> 05:48.328
Tom's got a job on a paper.

05:48.372 --> 05:52.242
I'll stay for the wedding.
I don't want to steal their thunder.

05:52.285 --> 05:55.460
But after that, I'll go to Dublin.

05:55.503 --> 05:59.634
To live with him? Unmarried?

05:59.678 --> 06:03.244
I'll live with his mother
while the banns are read.

06:03.288 --> 06:05.331
And then we'll be married.

06:05.374 --> 06:08.245
And I'll get a job as a nurse.

06:08.288 --> 06:11.028
What does your mother make of this?

06:11.071 --> 06:13.941
If you must know, she
thinks we're very foolish.

06:13.985 --> 06:16.811
So, at least we have
something in common.

06:16.855 --> 06:21.682
I won't allow it! I will not allow
my daughter to throw away her life!

06:21.726 --> 06:24.117
You can posture all you
like, Papa, it won't

06:24.161 --> 06:26.552
make any difference.
Yes, it will! How?

06:26.595 --> 06:30.510
I don't want any money! You can
hardly lock me up until I die!

06:30.553 --> 06:33.118
I'll say goodnight.

06:33.162 --> 06:36.163
But I can promise you one thing.

06:36.206 --> 06:39.424
Tomorrow morning, nothing will have
changed.

06:39.467 --> 06:41.033
Tom.

06:49.339 --> 06:52.381
He's not coming here!

06:52.382 --> 06:55.340
I don't want him to see this place.

06:55.383 --> 06:58.471
I won't have him pity me.
The question is are

06:58.515 --> 07:01.558
you prepared to let them
in to Charlie's life?

07:03.994 --> 07:07.256
I suppose so, yes. Good.

07:08.298 --> 07:11.429
I'll ask them to Downton
for Monday at four

07:11.430 --> 07:14.517
and this time, it'll
be all above board.

07:16.735 --> 07:21.084
Can't expect to live here free forever.
I didn't expect to get booted out.

07:21.127 --> 07:24.040
You'll have to find some work.

07:24.041 --> 07:28.998
It's not that easy. Every Tom, Dick and
Harry's looking for work these days.

07:29.042 --> 07:33.608
And they all don't have a hand
like a Jules Verne experiment.

07:35.087 --> 07:38.521
Mr Branson. I know it wasn't easy
last night.

07:38.565 --> 07:43.696
You should have spoken out long ago.
Spoken out about what?

07:43.740 --> 07:46.567
Why not?

07:46.610 --> 07:50.263
Lady Sybil and I are getting
married.

07:51.219 --> 07:53.481
Have you no shame?!

07:55.611 --> 08:00.177
I'm sorry you feel like that,
Mr Carson. You're a good man.

08:00.221 --> 08:03.527
But, no, I have no shame.

08:03.569 --> 08:06.569
In fact, I have great
pride in the love of that

08:06.570 --> 08:09.527
young woman and I will
strive to be worthy of it.

08:09.571 --> 08:13.745
I will not disgrace myself by
discussing it, nor will anyone else.

08:13.789 --> 08:17.920
Now, if you will go, Mr Branson,
we will continue with our day.

08:17.964 --> 08:22.573
Leave an address where we will forward
what is owing to you. No problem.

08:22.616 --> 08:28.270
I'll be at the Grantham Arms until Lady
Sybil is ready to make her departure.

08:28.313 --> 08:30.879
I bid you all a good day.

08:32.923 --> 08:36.880
Is it really true?
Please! I have asked for silence.

08:36.923 --> 08:40.402
And silence I will have.

08:45.751 --> 08:50.231
What on Earth is it? A gramophone.
Some cousins of mine have given it.

08:50.273 --> 08:52.796
You should stand well clear

08:52.839 --> 08:55.448
when you light the
blue touch paper.

08:55.492 --> 08:57.796
All on your own?

08:59.493 --> 09:01.971
I've left space at
the front for Jules.

09:02.015 --> 09:04.580
I know Lavinia's getting
something from papa.

09:04.624 --> 09:09.104
And from me. As she's so slight,
a real necklace would flatten her.

09:11.756 --> 09:14.626
What news of Sybil?
Papa is with her now.

09:14.670 --> 09:17.496
I'm afraid it'll end in tears.

09:17.539 --> 09:20.801
Maybe, but they won't be Sybil's.

09:20.844 --> 09:25.453
I used to think that Mary's beau
was a Leonce but compared to this,

09:25.454 --> 09:28.107
he's practically a Hapsburg.

09:30.281 --> 09:33.759
Don't worry. Your turn will come.

09:33.803 --> 09:37.934
Will it? Or am I just to be
the maiden aunt?

09:37.978 --> 09:42.283
Isn't this what they do? Arrange
presents for their pretty relations?

09:42.326 --> 09:45.848
Don't be defeatist, dear,
it's very middle class.

09:45.849 --> 09:49.850
I'd better go up and support your
father.

09:49.893 --> 09:52.893
Your threats are
hollow, don't you see?

09:52.937 --> 09:55.938
I won't be received in London?
I won't be welcome at court?

09:55.982 --> 09:59.460
How do I make you understand,
I couldn't care less?

10:02.330 --> 10:05.374
I do hope I'm interrupting
something.

10:05.417 --> 10:09.766
I only wish you were. I seem to be
getting nowhere. Have you seen Cora?

10:09.810 --> 10:12.158
She's lying down.

10:12.201 --> 10:14.985
And can we blame her?

10:15.028 --> 10:21.203
Now, Sybil, dear, this sort of thing is
all very well in novels, but in reality,

10:21.247 --> 10:24.204
it can prove very uncomfortable

10:24.247 --> 10:28.030
and while I am sure Branson
has many virtues...

10:28.074 --> 10:32.075
No, no, he's a good driver.
I will not give him up!

10:32.118 --> 10:36.814
Don't be rude to your grandmother.
No, she's not being rude. Just wrong.

10:36.858 --> 10:39.206
This is my offer.

10:39.250 --> 10:43.163
I will stay one week to avoid
the impression I've run away

10:43.207 --> 10:45.903
and because I don't want to
spoil Matthew's wedding.

10:45.946 --> 10:48.556
Then we will marry in Dublin

10:48.599 --> 10:52.295
and whoever wishes to visit
is welcome. Out of the question!

10:52.339 --> 10:55.078
Will you forbid Mary and Edith?
No, no.

10:55.122 --> 10:57.775
Don't say anything you
may have to retract.

10:57.819 --> 11:01.689
Know this. There will be no more
money.

11:01.732 --> 11:05.776
From here on in, your life
will be very different. Well...

11:05.820 --> 11:08.385
Bully for that.

11:10.386 --> 11:14.343
I thought this might tide
you over...

11:14.386 --> 11:17.343
Whatever's the matter?
I'm sure I'll be all

11:17.387 --> 11:20.300
right if I can just stay
still for a moment.

11:20.344 --> 11:23.258
You will not stay still.
Not down here.

11:23.301 --> 11:26.215
Get to bed this minute.
I'll send for the doctor.

11:26.258 --> 11:30.085
I can't. We've got the Crawleys
tonight and Miss Swire.

11:30.129 --> 11:34.042
What with this business of Lady
Sybil. I'll deal with it.

11:35.999 --> 11:41.131
Look, get Mr Mosley to help.
There's no need. I mean it!

11:41.174 --> 11:45.348
The war is no longer an excuse for
sloppy presentation. Very well,

11:45.392 --> 11:49.828
I'll ask him, but only on condition
you go to bed.

11:52.872 --> 11:57.525
Are you too hot in that, m'lady?
You still have time to change.

11:57.568 --> 11:59.655
No. Thank you.

12:05.395 --> 12:09.701
So, what do we do next?
God knows!

12:09.745 --> 12:12.962
This is what comes of spoiling her.

12:13.006 --> 12:15.920
The mad clothes, the nursing.

12:15.963 --> 12:18.877
What were we thinking of?
That's not fair.

12:18.920 --> 12:21.442
She's a wonderful nurse
who's worked very hard.

12:21.486 --> 12:23.963
And she's forgotten who she is!

12:23.964 --> 12:29.227
Has she, Robert? Or have we
overlooked who she really is?

12:30.443 --> 12:34.227
If you're turning American on me,
I'll go downstairs.

12:36.227 --> 12:39.053
Mr Carson likes to serve
two white wines which

12:39.054 --> 12:41.837
you should open and decant
just before they eat.

12:41.881 --> 12:45.446
A light one for the hors d'oeuvres,
a heavy one with the soup.

12:45.490 --> 12:51.013
Keep that going for the fish then change
to claret which you need to decant now.

12:51.056 --> 12:54.666
There's a pudding wine and,
after that, whatever they want in

12:54.709 --> 12:58.362
the drawing room with their coffee.
It's a wonder they make it upstairs.

12:58.406 --> 13:00.841
They don't drink
much of any of it.

13:00.884 --> 13:03.407
Let me show you the decanters.
These four...

13:03.449 --> 13:05.885
So, I don't have to receive
that terrible man again.

13:05.929 --> 13:08.364
It won't be necessary.

13:08.407 --> 13:12.712
They'll meet her in here but...
Should you be downstairs, m'lady?

13:12.756 --> 13:15.669
I'm perfectly all right,
thank you.

13:16.887 --> 13:19.148
Why Mosley? I could have done it.

13:19.191 --> 13:22.280
But you always make a mountain
out of not being a servant.

13:22.322 --> 13:25.367
I'm just trying to be helpful.

13:25.410 --> 13:29.541
I'm afraid, "being helpful", is not
something we associate you with.

13:32.716 --> 13:36.413
It's wonderful what fear
can do to the human spirit.

13:36.455 --> 13:39.021
You quite right, Mr Mosley?

13:39.065 --> 13:42.762
Yes, I just want to be absolutely
sure

13:42.804 --> 13:45.675
that this is the lighter wine.

13:45.718 --> 13:48.674
What does it matter as
long as it's white? No.

13:48.675 --> 13:52.459
I believe in starting the way
you mean to go on.

13:55.807 --> 13:59.329
Don't want to get off on the wrong
foot.

13:59.373 --> 14:01.591
I'm glad you're here, Sybil.

14:01.634 --> 14:03.895
I was afraid you'd have
a tray in your room.

14:03.939 --> 14:07.025
Maybe you should have done.
Why?

14:07.026 --> 14:10.070
I'm not eloping like a
thief in the night.

14:10.114 --> 14:13.158
I might have once but Mary and
Edith talked me out of it.

14:13.201 --> 14:16.115
The plot thickens.

14:16.159 --> 14:19.637
After all, Sybil's had time
to think about it. Mother!

14:19.681 --> 14:22.333
It is not for us to have an opinion.

14:24.465 --> 14:27.160
Mr Mosley, are you quite well?

14:27.204 --> 14:30.987
I'm all right, thank you, sir.
I don't believe you are.

14:31.031 --> 14:35.336
The awful truth is, I'm not quite
all right. I'm afraid I'm going

14:35.379 --> 14:39.380
to ask you to excuse me.
I'm so sorry.

14:40.293 --> 14:44.294
Would you like us to call
Dr Clarkson? No, it's too late.

14:44.338 --> 14:46.686
He's coming for Mr
Carson, Your Lordship.

14:46.729 --> 14:48.990
I'll bring him up
when he arrives.

14:49.034 --> 14:51.599
I can sleep in my dressing room.

14:53.339 --> 14:56.253
I'm glad I've got you.
What you serving?

14:56.297 --> 15:00.296
They're on the main course
so I can spare a moment?

15:00.340 --> 15:03.515
I've been thinking and...

15:03.558 --> 15:07.342
I have to say something
that you won't agree with.

15:09.386 --> 15:11.473
We're going to get married.

15:11.516 --> 15:14.691
We can't. Not now.
You're not listening.

15:14.734 --> 15:17.909
Go to Ripon tomorrow and take out
a special license,

15:17.953 --> 15:21.475
I don't care how much it costs,
and fix the day.

15:21.518 --> 15:25.693
We'll tell no-one, but this,
you will do. I can't.

15:25.736 --> 15:28.910
Aren't I as strong as Lady Sybil?
I don't doubt that.

15:28.954 --> 15:33.433
Well, then, if she can do it,
so can we.

15:33.434 --> 15:35.955
That's what I've been thinking.

15:35.999 --> 15:39.477
I have stuck by you, through thick
and thin.

15:39.521 --> 15:42.043
Thin and thin, more like.

15:42.087 --> 15:46.566
Mr Bates, if we have to face this,
then we will face it

15:46.609 --> 15:50.741
as husband and wife and will not be
moved to the sidelines

15:50.784 --> 15:55.220
to watch from a distance, with no
right even to be kept informed.

15:55.263 --> 15:57.959
I will be your next of kin.

15:59.308 --> 16:02.830
And you can't deny me that.
Anna!

16:02.874 --> 16:05.265
You better come, quick.

16:10.353 --> 16:13.222
Mr Mosley? What's happened?

16:13.266 --> 16:18.311
Haven't you taken it in yet?
I'm not well. I'm not well, at all.

16:18.355 --> 16:21.485
First, Mr Carson then her ladyship
and now him.

16:21.529 --> 16:24.442
Help him down to
the servants hall.

16:24.486 --> 16:27.399
The doctor can look at him,
too, when he gets here.

16:29.226 --> 16:33.053
Spanish flu has found it's way
to Yorkshire. And to Downton.

16:33.097 --> 16:35.792
Dr Clarkson says
he's got ten cases.

16:35.836 --> 16:38.488
I thought Mosley had
joined the Temperance League.

16:38.532 --> 16:44.446
I'm afraid he's been taken ill, My Lord.
I'm sorry. Mosley, too? Good heavens.

16:44.489 --> 16:47.881
Everyone's falling like ninepins.

16:47.925 --> 16:50.317
Lavinia?

16:50.360 --> 16:53.621
Do you know, I'm not at all well,
either.

16:53.665 --> 16:57.796
I wonder if I could lie down for a
minute? Of course. Come to my room.

16:57.840 --> 17:02.232
They'll have lit the fire by now.
Excuse me.

17:10.319 --> 17:15.756
Do you think we should take her
home? No, let her rest for a moment.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.842
Well, I think I should go and help.

17:18.843 --> 17:24.367
Wasn't there a masked ball in Paris
when cholera broke out?

17:24.409 --> 17:30.019
Half the guests were dead before they
left the ballroom. Thank you, Mama.

17:30.063 --> 17:32.933
That's cheered us up no end.

17:35.759 --> 17:41.934
I'll take you to Mr Carson now and then
to see Mr Mosley in the servant's hall.

17:41.978 --> 17:45.109
Dr Clarkson, you're kind to come.
How is she?

17:45.153 --> 17:48.806
Not too bad but she'll need some
nursing for a day or two.

17:48.849 --> 17:51.675
Don't worry about that, all our
daughters are professionals.

17:51.719 --> 17:54.546
Let's leave her
to get some rest.

17:54.589 --> 17:56.849
Miss Swire may be
another victim.

17:56.850 --> 17:59.112
She's sleeping now, I don't
want to disturb her.

17:59.155 --> 18:01.764
When she wakes give her
some aspirin, cinnamon and

18:01.808 --> 18:04.373
milk and keep her here.
I'll look at her tomorrow.

18:04.417 --> 18:09.157
We better go to Carson.
I'll come, too.

18:51.642 --> 18:55.078
Where is everyone?
I'm not sure.

18:56.166 --> 18:59.862
Cousin Violet's gone home.
What about you?

18:59.905 --> 19:02.645
I'm waiting for Lavinia and mother.

19:02.688 --> 19:07.037
Dr Clarkson wants Lavinia to stay
here. He'll see her tomorrow.

19:09.037 --> 19:12.995
I don't know this one.
Actually, I rather like it.

19:13.038 --> 19:16.082
I think it was in a show
that flopped.

19:16.125 --> 19:19.126
Zip Goes A Million, or something.

19:34.085 --> 19:38.651
Can you manage without your stick?
You are my stick.

19:42.174 --> 19:45.000
We were a show that flopped.

19:47.262 --> 19:49.523
God, Mary.

19:50.870 --> 19:54.220
I'm so, so sorry.

19:56.003 --> 19:58.089
You know how sorry I am.

19:58.133 --> 20:00.655
Don't be.

20:00.699 --> 20:03.090
It wasn't anyone's fault.

20:03.091 --> 20:05.786
If it was, it was mine.

20:07.569 --> 20:12.005
You know cousin Violet came to me,
told me to marry you.

20:12.049 --> 20:15.267
When was this? A while ago.

20:15.310 --> 20:18.615
When we knew I would walk again.

20:18.659 --> 20:20.920
Classic granny.

20:20.963 --> 20:23.181
What did you say?

20:24.268 --> 20:28.747
I couldn't accept Lavinia's
sacrifice of her life.

20:29.834 --> 20:35.096
Her children, her future and then give
her the brush off when I was well again,

20:35.140 --> 20:38.009
well, I couldn't, could I?

20:38.010 --> 20:40.663
Of course not.

20:40.706 --> 20:43.663
However much I might want to.

20:44.663 --> 20:47.229
Absolutely not.

21:01.536 --> 21:03.710
Hello?

21:05.188 --> 21:07.755
What are you doing up?

21:07.797 --> 21:11.016
Shouldn't we be getting back.
It's decided.

21:11.059 --> 21:13.146
You're staying here.

21:13.190 --> 21:17.452
Dr Clarkson's coming in the morning
so he can treat you all together.

21:17.496 --> 21:22.104
You can borrow some things until
Matthew brings you what you need.

21:22.148 --> 21:25.236
I'll go and organize a room.

21:32.542 --> 21:34.890
How do you feel?

21:34.933 --> 21:38.977
Like a nuisance.
You could never be that.

21:40.803 --> 21:45.978
I mean it, Matthew.
Don't ever let me be a nuisance.

21:47.414 --> 21:52.153
Don't ever let me get in the way,
please.

21:54.024 --> 21:58.632
I'll sleep on a chair in her room.
There's no need for that. I don't mind.

21:58.676 --> 22:02.895
I'd like to be on hand.
So, we're quite the hospital again.

22:02.938 --> 22:06.765
You'll probably gain more patients
over the next few da...

22:09.940 --> 22:14.548
You don't need to worry about
Mosley. He'll be fine in the morning.

22:16.984 --> 22:21.376
The others have Spanish flu.
He's just drunk.

22:31.638 --> 22:33.988
Did you want Mr Bates, My Lord?

22:34.030 --> 22:37.771
I forgot to say I want to be
woken early. I can tell him that.

22:37.814 --> 22:42.815
Freddie got into Ripon Grammar,
so whatever you said, it worked.

22:42.858 --> 22:46.163
Marvellous, some good news at last.

22:48.337 --> 22:53.338
I hate to hear you talk like that.
I'm sorry, that was selfish of me,

22:53.382 --> 22:57.818
to spoil your happy moment.
You need never say sorry to me.

22:57.861 --> 23:00.731
How are you?

23:00.775 --> 23:02.862
Really?

23:02.905 --> 23:06.515
Since you ask, I'm wretched.

23:06.601 --> 23:10.472
I lost my youngest child today,
I suspect forever, and I can't

23:10.516 --> 23:14.647
see any way round it. I wish
you knew how much I want to help.

23:17.212 --> 23:19.648
Do you?

23:21.604 --> 23:24.823
I think you know I do.

23:35.607 --> 23:39.390
I'll see if I can get up tomorrow.
Don't be foolish.

23:39.391 --> 23:44.434
You're ill and in all probability,
you'll be a lot iller in the morning.

23:44.478 --> 23:47.783
How will you manage?
What about the wedding?

23:47.826 --> 23:52.654
I'm not sure there'll be a wedding,
but I won't burden you with it.

23:52.697 --> 23:58.524
Perhaps Mr Mosley could come on a
permanent basis, until I'm better.

23:58.568 --> 24:01.697
I doubt that's a
solution, Mr Carson.

24:01.698 --> 24:04.786
Neither my patience or his
liver could stand it.

24:13.657 --> 24:16.875
Who is it?

24:18.223 --> 24:20.920
I'm sorry, My Lord, we
never settled a time

24:20.963 --> 24:23.572
you wanted to be woken.
Early, I think,

24:23.616 --> 24:27.008
with everyone ill, seven.

24:27.051 --> 24:29.529
I'll breakfast at half past.

24:29.573 --> 24:32.748
Very good, My Lord. Good night.

24:42.141 --> 24:44.706
This isn't fair.

24:44.750 --> 24:48.576
I'm placing you in an impossible
situation.

24:48.620 --> 24:51.185
I want to be with you.

24:53.577 --> 24:55.925
Let me.

25:01.623 --> 25:03.797
I see.

25:05.666 --> 25:09.754
You don't want me now. I want you
with every fiber of my being

25:09.798 --> 25:12.885
but it isn't fair to you,
it isn't fair to anyone.

25:12.929 --> 25:15.973
I wish I were different.
I wish everything was.

25:21.191 --> 25:23.974
I don't want you different.

25:25.888 --> 25:28.627
I like you the way you are.

25:31.323 --> 25:33.497
Thank you for that.

25:34.671 --> 25:37.107
I will cherish it.

25:37.151 --> 25:39.281
Truly.

26:20.419 --> 26:23.332
What can I bring to help?

26:23.333 --> 26:26.203
Ice, to bring her temperature down.
Mrs Hughes.

26:28.159 --> 26:31.986
Sir Richard telephoned this morning.
He's coming down to help.

26:32.030 --> 26:35.509
Can you have some rooms made ready
for him and his valet?

26:35.552 --> 26:39.249
And tell Mrs Patmore.
Very good, m'lady.

26:49.207 --> 26:51.729
'I don't accept I'm ruining her
life!'

26:51.772 --> 26:55.904
Nor cutting her off from her family.
You cut her off, that's your decision!

26:55.947 --> 27:00.382
How will you look after her?! How
can you hope to provide for her?

27:00.383 --> 27:04.819
You seem to think she can only be happy
in some version of Downton Abbey.

27:04.862 --> 27:09.515
If she wanted that life,
she would not be marrying me.

27:10.602 --> 27:12.646
Very well.

27:14.081 --> 27:17.647
I'd hoped to avoid this, but I see
that I can't!

27:18.690 --> 27:21.995
How much will you take to leave us
in peace?

27:22.039 --> 27:24.996
What? You must have doubts.

27:25.039 --> 27:28.953
You said your own mother thinks
you're foolish. Yes, she does.

27:28.997 --> 27:33.650
Yield to those doubts and take enough
to make a new life back in Ireland.

27:33.694 --> 27:38.128
I'll be generous if we can bring
this nonsense to an end. I see.

27:38.129 --> 27:40.825
You know your trouble, My Lord?

27:40.868 --> 27:46.348
You're like all of your kind, you think
you have the monopoly of honor!

27:46.392 --> 27:49.347
Doesn't it occur to you
that I believe the best

27:49.348 --> 27:52.261
guarantee of Sybil's
happiness lies with me?

27:52.262 --> 27:55.741
Well, if you're not prepared
to listen to reason!

27:55.784 --> 28:00.437
I'm not prepared to listen to insults.
Then, I'll bid you good day.

28:00.481 --> 28:03.133
And I want you to leave the village.

28:03.177 --> 28:06.916
Even though she'll come to me
the moment I call?

28:06.960 --> 28:12.482
Do you really want me to leave now, when
I will take her with me that same hour?

28:23.920 --> 28:27.398
There you are.
Dr Clarkson's here.

28:27.442 --> 28:30.616
Cora's not at all well.
Sybil and Edith are with her.

28:30.660 --> 28:34.747
Mary's gone to meet Sir Richard
from the train. Why's he coming?

28:34.791 --> 28:38.574
He wants to be useful.
I don't see how. My Lord.

28:38.618 --> 28:41.227
We're two more maids down.
I hope you forgive

28:41.271 --> 28:43.749
some catch as catch can
in the days ahead.

28:43.793 --> 28:47.229
Which maids? Not Jane?
No, My Lord. Not Jane.

28:48.924 --> 28:51.403
Thank you. What are they doing?

28:51.446 --> 28:55.360
Decorations for the wedding.
It still hasn't been canceled.

28:55.403 --> 28:58.012
They have to prepare for it.

28:58.056 --> 29:01.013
If Anna or Jane appear,
tell them to come

29:01.057 --> 29:03.927
and help me do the
room for Sir Richard.

29:03.970 --> 29:07.623
I can help with the bedroom then
I'll sort out a room for his man

29:07.667 --> 29:10.319
and serve at dinner.
I can't pay you. Call it rent.

29:10.363 --> 29:14.755
The awful truth is the wedding
simply cannot go ahead.

29:14.799 --> 29:17.494
Don't say that. I must.

29:17.538 --> 29:21.713
Dr Clarkson says you'll be groggy
for at least a week, maybe longer.

29:21.756 --> 29:24.975
We have to face the facts.
What about my father?

29:25.017 --> 29:30.410
Matthew can telephone him.
He can't come here while everyone's ill.

29:30.453 --> 29:34.933
He has a weak chest, we mustn't
take the risk. All right.

29:34.976 --> 29:38.455
I suppose we've made a decision,
then, to delay?

29:38.499 --> 29:43.630
I don't think we've got any choice.
No. I'm afraid we don't.

29:47.326 --> 29:50.283
At least she doesn't seem
too serious. No, no.

29:50.326 --> 29:54.415
I'd say she's been lucky. I am
terribly sorry about the wedding.

29:54.457 --> 29:57.589
These things are sent to try us.

29:57.632 --> 30:00.459
Why didn't anyone tell
me she was like this?

30:00.502 --> 30:03.286
She took a turn for the
worse half an hour ago.

30:03.329 --> 30:07.113
Where were you?
Out, I went for a walk.

30:13.504 --> 30:16.505
There we are, m'lady, that's better,
isn't it?

30:16.549 --> 30:19.374
She's been with her all night.

30:19.375 --> 30:22.202
O'Brien, you must have a rest.
Not just now, My Lord.

30:22.245 --> 30:25.289
I want to see her through
the worst, if I can.

30:25.333 --> 30:28.290
I'll just make this
cooler for you.

30:29.594 --> 30:32.812
How is she, really?
Tell me the truth.

30:32.856 --> 30:37.727
I can't yet. Dr Clarkson says we
will know more in a few hours.

30:37.770 --> 30:39.901
God almighty! How can this be?

30:39.944 --> 30:44.989
My whole life gone over a cliff
in the course of a single day.

30:45.336 --> 30:48.859
Take care of that, thank you.

30:48.902 --> 30:52.599
How are you doing?
I'm not sure.

30:52.643 --> 30:55.295
Her ladyship's worse.
I'm sorry.

30:55.338 --> 31:00.296
Jane said you wanted to see me.
I've done it. I've booked the registrar.

31:00.339 --> 31:04.862
- When for?
- He's had a cancellation

31:04.905 --> 31:09.254
- so it's Friday afternoon.
- This Friday?

31:10.689 --> 31:16.082
Ethel, what are you doing here?
The Bryants have turned up aga...

31:17.168 --> 31:19.516
That's what.

31:19.560 --> 31:23.561
I'll find Mrs Hughes and come back
for you.

31:29.648 --> 31:33.214
I hope I haven't kept you waiting.
No, no.

31:33.258 --> 31:38.868
We have illness in the house so I hope
you'll excuse Lord and Lady Grantham.

31:38.912 --> 31:43.304
It's not them we've come to see,
is it? Is she here?

31:43.346 --> 31:45.738
She's just coming now.

31:52.914 --> 31:55.958
May I meet him properly?

31:56.002 --> 31:59.698
Come along, Charlie.

31:59.741 --> 32:03.090
This nice lady is your grandmother.

32:03.133 --> 32:06.134
Perhaps you could call me, "Gran"?

32:06.178 --> 32:08.917
He's a stout little chap, isn't he?

32:08.961 --> 32:12.525
And so like Charles. I thought it
when we were last here.

32:12.526 --> 32:17.570
I know what was said at the time
and Mr Bryant's sorry for it now.

32:17.614 --> 32:20.658
But I could see he was just like
Charles.

32:20.701 --> 32:24.659
Never mind all that, let's get down
to business. Business?

32:24.702 --> 32:27.616
That's what you want
from us, isn't it?

32:27.659 --> 32:30.659
Find out what me mean to do for
little Charlie in the future?

32:33.400 --> 32:36.225
What do you mean, "She might die"?
What do you think

32:36.226 --> 32:39.096
happens with a fatal illness?
The fairies come?

32:39.140 --> 32:43.401
If anything happens to her, it
won't be your fault, Miss O'Brien.

32:43.445 --> 32:45.836
I've never seen such care.

32:45.880 --> 32:49.924
I wish I could talk to her, that's
all. But she doesn't know me.

32:49.967 --> 32:54.229
I'm sure she knows how hard you've
worked for her. It's not that.

32:54.272 --> 32:57.404
There's something I nee...

32:57.448 --> 32:59.796
Never mind.

32:59.838 --> 33:02.839
Either I will or I won't.

33:05.362 --> 33:08.362
You never know people, do you.
You can work with

33:08.363 --> 33:11.362
them for 20 years, you
don't know them at all.

33:11.406 --> 33:14.103
What? You mean give him up?

33:14.145 --> 33:17.755
Never see him again?
Those are my terms.

33:19.234 --> 33:23.756
But would it hurt if Ethel were
to care for him in your own house?

33:23.800 --> 33:26.931
She could be his nurse.
That might be possible.

33:26.974 --> 33:31.932
Of course she can't be his nurse.
We need to bring him up as a gentleman.

33:31.975 --> 33:34.715
Send him to Harrow and
Oxford, and all the

33:34.758 --> 33:37.498
while his mother's in
the servant's hall.

33:37.542 --> 33:39.455
How does that work? I could.

33:39.586 --> 33:41.542
No, we want to raise
his as our grandson,

33:41.585 --> 33:47.151
not as a housemaid's bastard!
Well, he has to know the truth sometime.

33:47.195 --> 33:49.587
Maybe, but not for a long time.

33:49.631 --> 33:52.414
Till then, his father had
a wartime marriage until

33:52.457 --> 33:55.197
he died and his mother
succumbed to Spanish flu.

33:55.240 --> 33:59.371
A lot of people have.
We've quite a few upstairs.

33:59.415 --> 34:03.502
And that, for many years at least,
is all that Charlie will be told.

34:03.546 --> 34:06.199
So, I'm just to be written out?

34:06.242 --> 34:09.069
Painted over? Buried?
What matters is what's

34:09.112 --> 34:11.982
good for Charlie.
And what's good for you!

34:13.243 --> 34:17.462
You've got a heart, I know you have.
You see what he's asking?

34:17.505 --> 34:21.940
Ethel, consider this. In the world
as it is, compare the two futures.

34:21.984 --> 34:25.724
The first, as my heir.
Educated, privileged, rich.

34:25.766 --> 34:29.029
Able to do what he wants,
marry whom he likes.

34:29.072 --> 34:32.030
The second, as the bastard son.

34:32.072 --> 34:35.117
I think we've heard enough of
that word for one day. Very well.

34:35.161 --> 34:39.507
As the nameless offshoot
of a drudge,

34:39.509 --> 34:42.074
you're his mother.

34:42.118 --> 34:44.813
Which would you choose for him?

34:48.771 --> 34:53.512
Suppose I could be his nurse and never
tell him who I am. I promise that.

34:53.554 --> 34:57.729
Surely... Come on! We all know that's
a promise you could never keep.

34:57.773 --> 35:00.252
I'm sorry,
Mrs Hughes, we need the

35:00.295 --> 35:02.904
doctor at once.
Her ladyship's much worse.

35:02.948 --> 35:07.166
I'm afraid... Go where you're needed,
we've had our say.

35:07.210 --> 35:11.122
You know how to reach us
when you've made your decision.

35:11.123 --> 35:14.342
Come along, Daphne.

35:25.430 --> 35:28.779
O'Brien?

35:28.822 --> 35:31.170
Is that you, O'Brien?

35:31.214 --> 35:34.519
Yes, m'lady, it's me, m'lady.

35:35.867 --> 35:38.737
You're so good to me.

35:38.781 --> 35:41.433
You've always been so good.

35:43.391 --> 35:46.824
Not always, m'lady. So good.

35:46.825 --> 35:49.782
No.

35:49.913 --> 35:55.175
And the fact is, I want to ask
so much for your forgiveness.

35:56.871 --> 36:01.481
Because I did something once
which I bitterly regret. Bitterly.

36:01.567 --> 36:05.872
And if you could only know
how much... So very good.

36:15.395 --> 36:18.745
How is she?
She slept and she seemed better.

36:18.787 --> 36:21.919
Then suddenly the fever came back.

36:24.397 --> 36:29.051
O'Brien, thank you for the way
you've looked after her. I mean it.

36:29.094 --> 36:32.225
I'm very grateful, whatever comes.

36:39.792 --> 36:42.792
What a marathon, but I think I got
them all.

36:42.835 --> 36:46.750
Everyone sends love. I told your
father I'll telegraph him

36:46.793 --> 36:50.837
as soon as it's safe for him
to come. But not before.

36:50.881 --> 36:55.143
Well, I don't think I should
leave you alone.

36:55.185 --> 36:57.968
But if you don't tell.

37:01.752 --> 37:07.188
I've been thinking about
the date for the rematch and...

37:08.710 --> 37:10.884
What is it?

37:10.927 --> 37:14.623
I wonder if we haven't been rather
lucky.

37:14.667 --> 37:17.799
Why, I think we've both been very
lucky.

37:17.842 --> 37:22.973
That we've been given a second
chance. A second chance at what?

37:24.495 --> 37:27.974
To be quite, quite sure about
what we're doing.

37:30.062 --> 37:33.627
Darling, what can you mean?
The thing is...

37:35.105 --> 37:37.193
I might as well say it.

37:40.150 --> 37:43.890
When I came downstairs and you
and Mary were dancing...

37:45.890 --> 37:48.196
I heard what you said.

37:49.891 --> 37:53.936
And I saw what you did. That was...
No, I'm not in a rage, in a fury,

37:53.978 --> 37:56.849
in fact, I think it's
noble of you to want

37:56.893 --> 37:59.762
to keep your word when
things have changed.

37:59.806 --> 38:03.763
But I'm not sure it would be right
for me to hold you to it.

38:03.807 --> 38:07.111
Lavinia, I can explain.
No, listen.

38:07.199 --> 38:10.460
I've had lots of time to think about
it.

38:12.547 --> 38:15.026
I love you very, very much.

38:16.766 --> 38:19.591
And I've wanted to
marry you from the

38:19.592 --> 38:22.418
first moment I saw you.
All that is true.

38:22.462 --> 38:26.028
But I didn't really know what I was
taking on.

38:26.072 --> 38:30.029
It's not in me to be
queen of the county.

38:30.072 --> 38:33.986
I'm a little person, an ordinary
person

38:34.030 --> 38:37.248
and when I saw you and Mary
together, I thought,

38:37.291 --> 38:42.031
how fine, how right you looked
together.

38:42.074 --> 38:45.379
I don't want to hear this!
You must!

38:47.031 --> 38:49.814
Because it isn't a sudden thing.

38:50.858 --> 38:54.989
I was starting to worry and then,
when you were wounded,

38:55.033 --> 38:58.686
I thought it was my calling
to look after you.

38:58.730 --> 39:00.904
And care for you.

39:03.208 --> 39:05.730
And I don't think
Mary would have done

39:05.774 --> 39:08.253
that quite as well as me, really.
No, no.

39:08.297 --> 39:11.123
Not nearly as well.

39:13.732 --> 39:16.080
I do have some self worth.

39:17.994 --> 39:20.995
Just not enough to make you
marry the wrong person.

39:21.038 --> 39:24.038
This is pointless, Mary is
marrying somebody else.

39:25.430 --> 39:27.691
Is she?

39:27.735 --> 39:29.996
We'll see.

39:30.039 --> 39:33.910
I won't let you do this.
You will.

39:38.694 --> 39:41.477
We won't fight about it now.

39:43.390 --> 39:46.912
In fact, I'm tired.
Can I rest for a bit?

39:47.956 --> 39:51.304
We'll talk later. Of course.

40:11.482 --> 40:16.091
It's good of you to come but I don't
really see what you can do.

40:16.135 --> 40:18.831
I thought I'd better do my bit.

40:18.874 --> 40:21.614
The chauffer's gone so
I could drive the car.

40:21.701 --> 40:24.528
Preferably over the chauffer.

40:24.571 --> 40:27.746
Father's not having an easy time
of it.

40:29.137 --> 40:32.051
How's Lady Grantham? Not well.

40:32.138 --> 40:34.790
Clarkson's with her now.

40:34.834 --> 40:38.226
And Miss Swire? She's...

40:41.574 --> 40:46.575
Is that why you've come? Because
I said Lavinia had been taken ill?

40:46.619 --> 40:50.576
I was coming up anyway,
in a day or two, for the wedding.

40:50.620 --> 40:53.229
Well, she won't be getting married
on Saturday.

40:53.272 --> 40:56.142
Which I suppose is what you'd like
best?

40:56.186 --> 40:59.490
But she's not seriously ill.

41:00.752 --> 41:03.317
I see what was worrying you.

41:03.404 --> 41:06.403
If Lavinia had been carried
off, you wanted to be

41:06.404 --> 41:09.405
here to stop Matthew from
falling into my arms

41:09.449 --> 41:13.710
on a tidal wave of grief.
It's a tricky disease.

41:18.798 --> 41:22.103
His lordship's asking for you,
m'lady.

41:27.495 --> 41:30.409
I think we should aim at a sort
of buffet dinner.

41:30.452 --> 41:33.366
Then they can run in and
out as it suits them.

41:33.367 --> 41:35.758
Sorry to make extra work.

41:35.801 --> 41:38.583
Never mind, it's hours like these
we must all pull together.

41:38.584 --> 41:41.323
This arrived in the post, Daisy.

41:41.367 --> 41:47.065
- Tea for Sir Richard in the drawing room.
- I'm glad to know he's here to help

41:47.107 --> 41:50.717
I can do it.
You're very obliging, Thomas.

41:50.760 --> 41:54.935
I can take some up to Mr Carson,
if you'd like?

41:56.370 --> 42:00.284
Is that from your Mr Mason?
He's not mine.

42:00.328 --> 42:05.849
What does he say? He just says,
again, we should talk about William.

42:05.850 --> 42:08.633
He wants me to go to his farm.
Poor man.

42:08.677 --> 42:11.503
Will you not visit him?
I'm not going to any farm!

42:11.504 --> 42:14.546
You're all he's got, Daisy.

42:14.547 --> 42:17.635
Well, then, he's got nobody
cos he hasn't got me.

42:23.201 --> 42:27.245
I'm sorry, m'lady, I didn't
think you'd want to change tonight.

42:27.289 --> 42:30.507
I don't. I just need a handkerchief.

42:30.550 --> 42:33.942
How's her ladyship?
Not good, I'm afraid.

42:35.986 --> 42:40.683
What is it?
I don't mean to bother you, m'lady.

42:40.726 --> 42:43.727
Go on. Can you keep a secret?

42:43.770 --> 42:46.205
Well, I know you can.

42:46.249 --> 42:49.293
You see, Mr Bates and I had a plan.

42:50.728 --> 42:54.685
To get married this coming Friday.
What?

42:54.728 --> 42:58.903
He's worried the police haven't
finished with him and, if he's right,

42:58.947 --> 43:01.382
then, I'm not going
through it with no

43:01.425 --> 43:03.904
proper place in his life.
A brave decision.

43:03.948 --> 43:08.166
Or a stupid one.
Anyway, with her ladyship ill now

43:08.209 --> 43:10.644
and half the servants on their
backs and everybody working.

43:10.645 --> 43:13.080
Where is the marriage to be?

43:13.124 --> 43:16.211
Just in a register office in Ripon.

43:16.254 --> 43:21.298
It wouldn't take long but... Go.
I'll cover for you. We're all here.

43:21.342 --> 43:24.604
You won't help mama by changing your
plans.

43:24.647 --> 43:27.734
You better come. She's worse.

43:30.344 --> 43:33.866
I've given her the epinephrine.
Doctor! No!

43:33.909 --> 43:36.389
What does that mean?

43:36.431 --> 43:39.823
It's a hemorrhage of the mucus
membranes.

43:39.867 --> 43:42.085
It's not unusual.

43:44.303 --> 43:48.520
It's all right, m'lady, don't worry.
Everything's going to be all right.

43:48.564 --> 43:53.000
Everything is clearly not all right.
How bad is it?

43:53.044 --> 43:56.957
If she lasts through the night,
she'll life.

43:59.523 --> 44:01.610
What about the others?

44:01.653 --> 44:04.132
Come with me.

44:05.176 --> 44:08.220
I'll be back shortly.

44:09.916 --> 44:13.003
I've given some medicine
to Mrs Hughes.

44:13.047 --> 44:17.178
She'll bring it up later. I gather
her ladyship is not improving.

44:17.222 --> 44:21.266
We'll, er, we'll know more tomorrow.
And Miss Swire?

44:21.310 --> 44:24.266
Not too bad, I think.
I'll go to her when I've

44:24.267 --> 44:27.267
seem the rest of the servants.

44:29.659 --> 44:33.659
Thank you, sir. Here we are,
Mr Carson.

44:33.703 --> 44:37.051
Now, have you got everything
you need?

44:38.574 --> 44:41.052
M'lady.

44:44.357 --> 44:49.184
I want to thank you for coming up,
m'lady. Not at all.

44:49.227 --> 44:54.620
I mean it. I know I've been
a disappointment to you.

44:54.663 --> 44:56.750
Maybe.

44:58.012 --> 45:02.882
But I've relied on your support for
too long to do without it entirely.

45:02.925 --> 45:06.796
You'll always have my support,
m'lady. And you, mine.

45:08.274 --> 45:10.666
On which subject...

45:10.710 --> 45:13.101
I should be careful of Thomas.

45:13.145 --> 45:18.711
I don't know how we're to get
rid of him after all this.

45:18.754 --> 45:23.799
I doubt he'll want to stay a footman
forever, so, watch out.

45:35.019 --> 45:39.323
You look very smart, Thomas.
I still have the shirt, m'lady.

45:39.367 --> 45:43.281
And I found my livery in the
cupboard so I thought, "Why not?"

45:47.325 --> 45:50.151
I have a place for you here.

45:53.326 --> 45:57.631
How's Lavinia?
All right, I think.

45:57.675 --> 46:02.675
The illness has made her rather
confused. What do you mean?

46:02.719 --> 46:05.415
Matthew! Mary!

46:05.458 --> 46:08.676
Is it mama?

46:08.720 --> 46:11.459
That's what's so... It's Lavinia.

46:17.896 --> 46:22.897
Let him go to her. Let him be with
her. Surely you owe her that?

46:24.853 --> 46:28.723
What happened?
This is how I found her.

46:28.767 --> 46:31.376
It's bad, I'm afraid.

46:31.420 --> 46:33.638
Very bad.

46:35.551 --> 46:40.247
The worst. I don't understand.
When I was with her, she was fine.

46:40.291 --> 46:45.335
It's a strange disease with sudden,
savage changes.

46:48.119 --> 46:52.597
I'm terribly sorry. What can I do?
Can I talk to her? Yes. Of course.

46:55.338 --> 46:59.295
My darling. Can you hear me?

46:59.337 --> 47:01.686
It's me. It's Matthew.

47:01.729 --> 47:04.338
Matthew.

47:07.774 --> 47:11.079
I'm so glad you're here.
Of course I'm here.

47:11.122 --> 47:13.210
Darling, where else would I be?

47:15.558 --> 47:17.863
Isn't this better?

47:17.906 --> 47:21.907
Really? I don't understand you.

47:24.212 --> 47:27.647
You have to make our decision.

47:32.213 --> 47:34.475
Be happy.

47:34.518 --> 47:36.909
For my sake.

47:39.084 --> 47:42.607
Promise me.

47:45.390 --> 47:47.651
It's all I want for you.

47:50.956 --> 47:53.130
Remember that.

48:00.348 --> 48:03.610
That's what I want.

48:03.654 --> 48:06.046
But I can't be happy.

48:06.088 --> 48:10.350
Not without you.
How could I be happy?

49:10.926 --> 49:13.362
What are you doing?

49:13.406 --> 49:16.536
They were put up for the wedding,
Mr Crawley.

49:16.580 --> 49:19.058
My dear chap.

49:19.102 --> 49:22.450
I cannot find the words to say how
sorry I am.

49:23.973 --> 49:26.060
How is cousin Cora?

49:27.625 --> 49:30.191
Much better, thank you.

49:30.234 --> 49:32.626
Glad to hear it.

49:32.670 --> 49:34.974
I came to see if there's
anything I can do.

49:35.018 --> 49:37.280
We've taken care of all that.

49:37.322 --> 49:40.975
We always use Grassby's. Of course.
Travis suggested Monday for the

49:41.019 --> 49:45.629
funeral to give people time to get
here. It will be in tomorrow's paper.

49:45.672 --> 49:48.237
That's very kind of you.

49:48.281 --> 49:51.847
Mary wanted to see you. No!

49:51.890 --> 49:53.978
I mean, I...

49:54.021 --> 49:57.021
don't really want to see anyone.
Not yet.

49:57.022 --> 49:59.979
Now I know everything's
settled, I'll go back.

50:00.022 --> 50:04.110
When you speak to her father,
do ask him to stay here.

50:04.153 --> 50:06.415
Thank you.

50:06.459 --> 50:08.979
He'll be very grateful.

50:08.980 --> 50:12.894
Just tell me what you want me to do
and I'll do it.

50:25.027 --> 50:27.114
Are you feeling more yourself?

50:27.158 --> 50:29.375
A bit.

50:29.376 --> 50:32.419
I still can't get over it.

50:33.289 --> 50:36.508
I hope you'll not pretend you liked
her now.

50:36.550 --> 50:40.507
I didn't want her here,
Mrs Hughes, I'll admit.

50:40.551 --> 50:45.682
But I had no objection to her being
happy somewhere else.

50:45.726 --> 50:48.509
A sight to gladden my heart.

50:48.553 --> 50:51.336
Is it? I hope it is.

50:51.380 --> 50:56.293
You gave us quite a fright.
They told me about Lavinia.

50:58.164 --> 51:00.598
The funeral is on Monday.

51:00.642 --> 51:03.034
I'd like to go, if I can.

51:14.905 --> 51:17.472
We're all right,

51:17.514 --> 51:20.211
aren't we, Robert?

51:21.907 --> 51:24.125
Of course we are.

51:25.168 --> 51:28.299
I got so caught up in
everything, I think

51:28.343 --> 51:31.386
I neglected you and
if I did, I'm sorry.

51:31.430 --> 51:34.169
Don't apologise to me.

51:42.867 --> 51:45.172
Ethel!

51:45.215 --> 51:48.737
Whatever are you doing here at this
time of night?

51:50.347 --> 51:53.086
I said I'd be back with
my answer and here I am.

51:53.130 --> 51:55.826
You know we're a
house in mourning?

51:55.869 --> 51:58.826
Yes and I'm sorry.

51:59.914 --> 52:04.218
But, if anything, it's made my mind
up for me.

52:04.262 --> 52:08.480
Life is short and what's my life
without Charlie?

52:09.785 --> 52:14.264
They're not having him.
As long as you're sure.

52:14.308 --> 52:16.960
They say they can do
better for him but what's

52:17.004 --> 52:19.569
better than his mother's love?
Answer me that.

52:19.613 --> 52:21.917
I'll write and tell them.

52:24.483 --> 52:27.875
You agree with me, though, don't
you?

52:27.919 --> 52:30.572
My opinion has no place in this.

52:53.532 --> 52:57.750
'I, John Bates. '
'I, John Bates. '

52:57.794 --> 53:02.055
'Take thee, Anna May Smith. '
'Take thee, Anna May Smith. '

53:02.099 --> 53:05.490
'To be my wedded wife. '
'To be my wedded wife. '

53:05.491 --> 53:09.969
'I, Anna May Smith. '
I, Anna May Smith.

53:10.013 --> 53:13.840
Take thee, John Bates.
Take thee, John Bates.

53:13.884 --> 53:17.493
To be my wedded husband.
To be my wedded husband.

53:17.536 --> 53:20.059
And now the ring.

53:26.625 --> 53:33.713
With this ring I plight thee
my troth.

53:33.757 --> 53:38.105
As a symbol of all we have promised.
As a symbol of all we have promised.

53:38.149 --> 53:41.932
And all that we share.
And all that we share.

53:45.193 --> 53:47.716
It therefore gives me great pleasure

53:47.759 --> 53:51.368
to say you are now husband and wife
together.

54:12.459 --> 54:14.633
You rang, My Lord?

54:16.721 --> 54:21.244
I keep forgetting Carson's ill.
Mrs Hughes says he's much better.

54:21.287 --> 54:24.331
I really want Bates. He'd gone out.
He's in your dressing room.

54:24.374 --> 54:27.375
He went up with
your evening shirt.

54:27.419 --> 54:30.028
Golly, is that the time?

54:31.680 --> 54:34.333
Actually, can you stay a moment?

54:34.376 --> 54:39.160
I was trying to think how to contrive
a meeting and here you are.

54:41.464 --> 54:44.204
You see...
I'm glad Lady Grantham's better.

54:44.247 --> 54:47.248
Truly.

54:47.292 --> 54:49.596
And don't worry.

54:49.640 --> 54:52.771
There's no harm done.

54:54.032 --> 54:56.119
No harm done yet.

54:58.772 --> 55:01.034
I'm almost packed.

55:01.076 --> 55:04.425
And I've given in my notice.

55:34.387 --> 55:38.431
This is the name and address
of my man of business.

55:41.301 --> 55:43.388
Why?

55:43.432 --> 55:46.346
You don't owe me anything.

55:46.389 --> 55:49.563
It's not for you.

55:49.607 --> 55:52.434
It's for Freddie.

55:52.477 --> 55:55.173
Let me give him a start in life.

55:58.565 --> 56:01.131
I'm not sure...
It would make me very happy.

56:01.174 --> 56:05.219
If I thought that, then I'd take it,
gladly.

56:07.436 --> 56:09.959
Will you be happy?

56:10.002 --> 56:12.263
Really?

56:13.393 --> 56:17.438
I have no right to be unhappy,
which is almost the same.

56:17.482 --> 56:19.569
Almost.

56:23.831 --> 56:26.179
Not quite.

56:30.745 --> 56:33.441
Can I kiss you before I go?

57:13.405 --> 57:16.057
The secret Mrs Bates.

57:16.101 --> 57:19.188
We will tell everyone but I thought
we should leave it a while.

57:19.232 --> 57:22.276
At least till after
the funeral, anyway.

57:22.320 --> 57:26.494
You'll have to control yourselves.
Well, we've had enough practice.

57:33.191 --> 57:35.626
Come with me.

58:00.501 --> 58:03.805
Smuggle Bates in here
when everyone has gone to bed.

58:03.849 --> 58:07.501
And for heaven's sake,
make sure he gets the right room.

58:07.545 --> 58:10.980
I don't know what to say, m'lady.

58:11.024 --> 58:13.850
Who did all this? Jane.

58:13.894 --> 58:17.373
I told her. She said it would be her
leaving present.

58:17.416 --> 58:20.808
You can stay all night.
She won't tell.

58:20.852 --> 58:23.807
M'lady, thank you.

58:23.808 --> 58:26.853
Very, very much.

58:29.680 --> 58:32.767
Are you sure you should be up,
Mr Carson?

58:32.810 --> 58:36.332
I wanted to check the silver before
tomorrow.

58:36.376 --> 58:40.159
I think I've cleaned all the pieces
we might need.

58:40.203 --> 58:44.943
We'll get everything ready
the moment breakfast is over.

58:44.987 --> 58:48.813
Thank you for the way you've kept it
all going, Thomas.

58:48.856 --> 58:51.901
I wish I knew how to express
my gratitude.

58:51.945 --> 58:54.814
You'll find a way, Mr Carson.

59:04.946 --> 59:07.991
I think that's everything we owe.

59:08.034 --> 59:12.253
Thank you, Mrs Hughes.
I'm sorry you're going, Jane.

59:12.295 --> 59:15.557
You're a good worker.
I wish you well.

59:15.601 --> 59:18.340
I'm sorry, too, Mrs Hughes.

59:18.384 --> 59:22.210
But in the end I think it's for the
best.

59:22.254 --> 59:24.559
For everyone.

59:24.602 --> 59:29.125
When all is said and done, my dear,
you may be right.

59:44.171 --> 59:48.258
Well... Mrs Bates?

59:50.911 --> 59:54.433
You've had your way with me.

01:00:00.217 --> 01:00:03.653
I just hope you don't live to regret
it.

01:00:05.783 --> 01:00:08.219
I couldn't regret it.

01:00:08.263 --> 01:00:10.915
No matter what comes.

01:00:12.959 --> 01:00:17.438
I know only that I am now
who I was meant to be.

01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:25.657
I'm not worthy of you,
that's all I know.

01:00:27.787 --> 01:00:31.658
And they'll call me names
for pulling you into my troubles.

01:00:35.224 --> 01:00:38.050
Mr Bates.

01:00:38.094 --> 01:00:42.573
We've waited long enough to be
together, you and I.

01:00:42.616 --> 01:00:44.921
And now that we're man and wife,

01:00:44.965 --> 01:00:48.487
can that not be enough,
just for this one night?

01:01:06.882 --> 01:01:08.969
Earth to earth,

01:01:09.012 --> 01:01:11.099
ashes to ashes,

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:14.144
dust to dust.

01:01:16.449 --> 01:01:20.101
In sure and in certain hope of the
resurrection to eternal life

01:01:20.145 --> 01:01:22.667
through our lord, Jesus Christ,

01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:28.450
we shall change our vile body that it
may be like unto his glorious body,

01:01:28.494 --> 01:01:31.103
according to the mighty working

01:01:31.147 --> 01:01:36.278
whereby he is able to subdue
all things to himself.

01:01:36.322 --> 01:01:40.366
Amen.

01:01:45.497 --> 01:01:49.411
Would you give him a moment?
Of course, ma'am, I understand.

01:01:59.065 --> 01:02:03.109
We better get moving if we're
to be back before they arrive.

01:02:03.153 --> 01:02:07.719
Mrs Patmore and Thomas will go ahead
in the trap. They'll sort it out.

01:02:07.762 --> 01:02:11.111
I've no doubt Thomas
will have everything sorted out.

01:02:11.154 --> 01:02:15.459
I'm sorry but it's no good thinking
we'll get shot of him now.

01:02:15.502 --> 01:02:18.503
Why doesn't that come as a surprise?

01:02:34.027 --> 01:02:37.637
I've been hoping I might meet you
here one day.

01:02:39.072 --> 01:02:42.899
I expect you'll come as often
as I try to do?

01:02:42.942 --> 01:02:45.769
It was a funeral...

01:02:45.812 --> 01:02:49.117
of a lady that was going to marry
Mr Crawley.

01:02:49.161 --> 01:02:51.770
I heard about that.

01:02:51.814 --> 01:02:56.032
There's nothing so wrong as when
young folks die.

01:02:59.728 --> 01:03:03.250
Nay, needn't hide your tears from
me, love.

01:03:07.033 --> 01:03:10.817
It does me good to see how much you
loved him, it does.

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:19.253
You must tell me if there's anything
I can do.

01:03:19.296 --> 01:03:22.167
Anything at all. Thank you.

01:03:22.210 --> 01:03:24.602
But I don't think so.

01:03:29.342 --> 01:03:32.038
That night when we were dancing.

01:03:32.081 --> 01:03:34.821
Lavinia came downstairs.

01:03:36.909 --> 01:03:39.648
She heard, she...

01:03:40.736 --> 01:03:44.519
She saw everything.

01:03:44.562 --> 01:03:47.389
How terrible for her.

01:03:48.824 --> 01:03:52.086
I'm so sorry.
Because of what she saw,

01:03:52.128 --> 01:03:55.390
she thought we should cancel
the wedding.

01:03:57.043 --> 01:04:00.391
That I belonged with you.

01:04:00.434 --> 01:04:02.652
Not with her.

01:04:05.566 --> 01:04:10.262
She gave up because of us.
She said tome when she was dying,

01:04:10.306 --> 01:04:12.872
"Isn't this better?"

01:04:15.698 --> 01:04:18.350
I know it's a cliche but...

01:04:19.829 --> 01:04:23.699
I believe she died of a broken
heart because of that kiss.

01:04:25.048 --> 01:04:27.918
We were the ones who killed her.

01:04:27.961 --> 01:04:32.266
Matthew. I could never be happy
now. Don't you see?

01:04:32.310 --> 01:04:35.398
We're cursed, you and I.

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:38.659
And there's nothing to be done
about it.

01:04:40.398 --> 01:04:43.095
Let's be strong, Mary.

01:04:44.138 --> 01:04:47.834
Let's accept that this is the end.

01:04:50.096 --> 01:04:52.227
Of course it's the end.

01:04:54.183 --> 01:04:56.749
How could it not be?

01:05:01.706 --> 01:05:04.751
I'm so very sorry about this.

01:05:07.229 --> 01:05:09.447
Thank you.

01:05:09.490 --> 01:05:13.969
Can I walk you up to the house
or...? Certainly, you can.

01:05:14.013 --> 01:05:17.057
I want you to.

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:37.191
So sad.

01:05:38.713 --> 01:05:43.714
Why are you here? To pay my respects
to Miss Swire. And to see Sybil.

01:05:43.758 --> 01:05:47.366
Lady Sybil! Papa, what's the point
in all that nonsense?

01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:52.933
I suppose you'll go to Dublin now,
isn't that your plan? In a day or two.

01:05:52.976 --> 01:05:57.412
Mama is well again and I see no
reason to delay.

01:05:57.456 --> 01:06:01.631
Although, I do so wish
we could have parted friends.

01:06:01.673 --> 01:06:06.197
What about you?
Do you want to part friends?

01:06:06.239 --> 01:06:10.023
I do. Although I don't expect to.

01:06:12.981 --> 01:06:15.111
All right.

01:06:17.024 --> 01:06:19.241
What?

01:06:19.242 --> 01:06:23.199
Well, if I can't stop you,
I see no profit in a quarrel.

01:06:23.243 --> 01:06:27.853
You'll have a very different life
from the one you might have lived,

01:06:27.895 --> 01:06:30.766
but if you're sure it's what you
want?

01:06:30.810 --> 01:06:32.940
I am.

01:06:32.984 --> 01:06:37.593
Then you may take my blessing
with you, whatever that means.

01:06:37.594 --> 01:06:42.681
Papa! It means more than
anything! More than anything!

01:06:46.378 --> 01:06:52.074
If you mistreat her, I will personally
have you torn to pieces by wild dogs.

01:06:52.118 --> 01:06:54.249
I'd expect no less.

01:06:54.292 --> 01:06:58.161
Will you come over for the wedding?
We'll talk about that later.

01:06:58.162 --> 01:07:01.945
And there'll be some money.
But not much.

01:07:18.209 --> 01:07:20.818
So, you've given in?

01:07:22.297 --> 01:07:25.080
She would have gone anyway.

01:07:25.124 --> 01:07:28.994
And perhaps we should let Lavinia's
last gift to us

01:07:29.037 --> 01:07:31.951
be a reminder of what really matters.

01:07:31.994 --> 01:07:35.343
You'll think that's soft?
Not at all.

01:07:35.386 --> 01:07:39.431
The aristocracy has not survived
by its intransigence.

01:07:39.474 --> 01:07:43.997
No, we must work with what
we've got to minimize the scandal.

01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:46.345
But what have we got to work with?

01:07:46.389 --> 01:07:50.128
You'd be surprised.
He's political, isn't he?

01:07:50.172 --> 01:07:52.520
And a writer.

01:07:52.563 --> 01:07:55.128
I could make something out of that.

01:07:55.129 --> 01:07:58.651
And there's a family called Branson

01:07:58.695 --> 01:08:01.435
with a place not far from Cork.

01:08:01.478 --> 01:08:04.565
I believe they have a
connection with the Howards.

01:08:04.609 --> 01:08:07.696
Surely we can hitch
him onto them?

01:08:12.958 --> 01:08:16.611
Mr Bates! You all right,
Mrs Patmore? I'm all right.

01:08:17.654 --> 01:08:22.002
There are two men waiting for you
in the servants hall.

01:08:39.050 --> 01:08:41.746
Are you looking for me?
John Bates?

01:08:41.790 --> 01:08:45.921
Yes. You are under arrest
on the charge of willful murder.

01:08:45.964 --> 01:08:49.617
You are not obliged to say anything
unless you desire to do so.

01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:52.443
Whatever you say will be
taken down in writing and

01:08:52.487 --> 01:08:55.314
may be given in evidence
against you upon trial.

01:08:55.358 --> 01:08:57.575
I understand.

01:08:57.618 --> 01:09:01.532
No! No!
Please... do whatever is required.

01:09:03.881 --> 01:09:07.142
I love you. And I love you.

01:09:07.185 --> 01:09:11.663
For richer, for poorer.
For better, for worse. Come along, sir.
