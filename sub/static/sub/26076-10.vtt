Of course it bothers me, but...

I don't think anyone would deny
that you did a brave thing

07:19.480 --> 07:22.900
by going back into Davos' place
to try and fix things.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.111
I did it to save myself.

Just stop making excuses for my behavior.

07:59.687 --> 08:02.607
I did something to you

08:04.358 --> 08:06.861
And the cornerstone
of my existence since then

08:06.944 --> 08:11.949
has been to hold on to the idea
that I had no other choice.

08:13.534 --> 08:15.161
Which is my own problem.

08:16.871 --> 08:17.872
But...

that destiny works, Ward.

21:02.427 --> 21:03.762
[Davos grunts]

21:12.896 --> 21:14.398
And stay down.

21:28.203 --> 21:30.289
[Danny] Heart of the dragon
has found a new home.

21:30.372 --> 21:32.040
[Colleen] It was pretty close there
for a minute.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.417
[Misty] But we did it.

21:33.500 --> 21:34.543
[Danny] Where's Mary?

21:35.252 --> 21:39.131
[Misty] I dropped her with the EMTs.
She needs help. She'll get it.

21:40.007 --> 21:42.676
I'm gonna take Davos in,
book him at the nine-four.

21:42.759 --> 21:45.762
So if you want to say anything,
now is the time.

21:57.399 --> 21:59.318
-[Danny] Hey, can I have a moment?
-[EMT] Yeah, go ahead.

22:06.325 --> 22:07.784
I didn't want it to end this way.

22:09.453 --> 22:10.954
Did everything I could to avoid it.

22:11.496 --> 22:15.500
After all I've done to you,
you still approach me with compassion.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.669
My compassion is a choice.

22:19.046 --> 22:20.213
It doesn't come easy.

22:20.964 --> 22:23.842
Your choices in K'un-Lun
led to this moment.

22:23.925 --> 22:26.345
No. I have my faults,

22:27.679 --> 22:29.264
and I'm learning to wear my mistakes.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.891
But you brought this on yourself.

22:30.974 --> 22:34.394
I grasped at a glory
that you can't even begin to comprehend.

22:34.478 --> 22:38.148
Of course I can.
But I know the cost is too high.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.735
It took a lot of effort
to convince people to save you.

22:43.528 --> 22:45.030
Give you another chance.

22:47.157 --> 22:48.492
I hope you can honor that.

22:49.743 --> 22:51.411
Do you think you've won, Danny?

22:53.872 --> 22:56.249
I inspired so many people.

22:57.334 --> 22:59.669
Sent a powerful message
out into the world.

22:59.753 --> 23:02.422
And there is nothing you can do
to stop it spreading.

23:02.506 --> 23:03.799
I'm not gonna give up on you.

23:04.758 --> 23:09.971
I'm not gonna give up hope that one day
you will come back to yourself.

23:10.055 --> 23:11.640
What did Lei Kung call you?

23:15.685 --> 23:19.564
"Chosen of Heaven"? "Touched by fire"?

23:21.566 --> 23:23.318
But he never knew you like I did.

23:25.195 --> 23:28.949
That you fought for the Fist
to fill a void in yourself.

23:29.866 --> 23:31.993
Do you really think destiny is enough?

23:32.661 --> 23:34.913
That it will lead you to a true purpose?

23:35.831 --> 23:36.998
Because it won't.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.293
At least I picked a path.

23:44.339 --> 23:45.841
I walked it.

23:46.675 --> 23:47.884
Because in the end, Danny,

23:47.968 --> 23:50.804
you still have no idea who you are
or what you stand for.

23:54.015 --> 23:55.183
Goodbye, Davos.

23:58.937 --> 24:01.398
[Misty] I thought you said
you'd never get any ink?

24:02.023 --> 24:03.191
[Colleen] Never say never.

24:03.275 --> 24:06.653
[chuckles] Well, now you're the one
with the badass right hook.

24:07.696 --> 24:10.365
On the bright side,
you can always get an upgrade.

24:11.158 --> 24:15.662
-I got some ideas. Maybe bling it out.
-Hmm.

24:15.745 --> 24:20.834
So, what's it like,
the heart of the dragon?

24:23.795 --> 24:24.880
I don't know.

24:25.964 --> 24:28.341
I'm not sure where I end and it begins.

24:30.177 --> 24:31.344
But it feels right.

24:32.971 --> 24:34.514
I'm proud of you, Colleen.

24:35.140 --> 24:37.851
And I'm excited to see
what you do with that thing.

24:38.477 --> 24:42.230
That's the hard part.
Using a weapon to make peace.

24:42.314 --> 24:44.649
I can't think of anybody
better suited to try.

24:46.902 --> 24:49.696
What about you? Five-year plan.

24:51.198 --> 24:52.908
You going to take the captain job?

24:53.658 --> 24:55.410
Ooh.

24:55.494 --> 24:56.495
[Colleen] No?

24:57.162 --> 25:01.124
I don't know if sitting behind a desk

25:01.208 --> 25:06.129
with a bunch of red tape and politics
is where I need to be right now.

25:07.297 --> 25:12.219
All I know is that you have skills
most people can't comprehend.

25:13.595 --> 25:15.764
And we could not have
done this without you.

25:16.431 --> 25:19.684
Well, shucks. [chuckles]

25:19.768 --> 25:21.478
It was a team effort.

25:21.561 --> 25:23.897
-[Colleen] Mmm.
-[both laugh]

25:23.980 --> 25:27.150
Besides... Knight... Wing...

25:27.901 --> 25:30.862
It's got a little... little ring to it.

25:30.946 --> 25:31.947
Little bit.

25:34.282 --> 25:39.412
Let's hang out soon, okay?
Grab a beer, do something normal.

25:39.496 --> 25:42.999
Ugh. It could be sooner than later.

25:43.083 --> 25:46.002
Last time I saw Luke,
I did not like what I saw.

25:46.086 --> 25:50.966
And now you've got one of the few weapons
that might make a dent in that man.

25:51.049 --> 25:55.095
[sighs] You got my number. Use it.

25:55.178 --> 25:56.555
Same goes for you.

25:57.472 --> 26:00.350
[Danny] Thanks for letting me say goodbye.
It means a lot.

26:00.433 --> 26:01.518
Absolutely.

26:02.060 --> 26:05.021
-Thanks again. I'll see you soon.
-Yeah.

26:05.730 --> 26:08.984
You and Davos.
I can't imagine how hard that must be.

26:09.067 --> 26:11.736
I know. But he chose his path.

26:12.529 --> 26:14.364
He was misguided, but maybe so was I.

26:14.447 --> 26:15.824
You have to let it go.

26:17.367 --> 26:18.493
So what about us?

26:18.577 --> 26:22.455
[scoffs] I have not even begun
to process this, let alone...

26:23.498 --> 26:26.001
Yeah. You need to let it sink in, I guess.

26:28.169 --> 26:29.796
We had a nice little life cooking.

26:31.214 --> 26:34.134
You did what you thought was right,
and no one can fault you for that.

26:34.968 --> 26:37.512
We just have to be honest
about the consequences.

26:41.933 --> 26:42.934
[sighs]

26:44.352 --> 26:46.563
You and I have been
through so much together.

26:49.107 --> 26:51.192
Like it or not, we'll always be bonded.

26:57.032 --> 26:57.949
[chuckles]

26:58.033 --> 27:01.036
Who would have thought that after meeting
a karate teacher at a public park

27:01.119 --> 27:03.079
hanging ads for her dojo,
we'd be standing here?

27:05.373 --> 27:07.834
Chance always looks like fate
in the taillights.

27:10.003 --> 27:11.004
Yeah.

27:13.673 --> 27:16.760
I should go. Check in with Bayard.

27:18.094 --> 27:20.889
Yeah, I'm gonna go back to the dojo.
Start cleaning up.

27:22.015 --> 27:23.058
Hey...

27:33.109 --> 27:34.903
I'll see you. I'll see you there.

27:48.583 --> 27:49.584
[sighs] [sniffles]

29:03.366 --> 29:04.367
[Sam] Wing?

29:06.911 --> 29:08.955
I told you not to call me that name.

29:09.038 --> 29:10.165
[Sam chuckles]

29:11.541 --> 29:12.709
Thank you...

29:13.376 --> 29:16.171
for the car and for everything else.

29:16.880 --> 29:17.881
Davos?

29:18.423 --> 29:21.009
This? Yeah, you should see the other guy.

29:22.635 --> 29:24.012
Won't be a problem anymore.

29:24.637 --> 29:25.638
[sighs] Good news.

29:26.723 --> 29:29.601
You know what happened to those kids?
Uh, BB's friends?

29:29.684 --> 29:31.478
Yeah, the one that attacked him
is in custody,

29:31.561 --> 29:34.939
the others got brought in for questioning.
Serves them right.

29:36.566 --> 29:37.901
They were struggling. A lot of people are.

29:41.321 --> 29:42.322
Yeah.

29:42.405 --> 29:44.073
I'm going to find a way to help 'em.

29:46.242 --> 29:48.995
Do you think we can have
a service here for BB?

29:49.078 --> 29:54.000
You know, anyone who knew him can come,
and anyone who didn't can learn about him.

29:54.083 --> 29:57.712
Sure. And when we're open again,
you can organize it yourself.

29:57.796 --> 30:00.131
-Cool. Thank you.
-Yeah.

30:00.757 --> 30:02.258
[Colleen] What's she still doing here?

30:02.342 --> 30:04.219
[Sam] Uh, she's been here all night.

30:04.302 --> 30:06.471
Gave a statement to the cops
and everything.

30:07.722 --> 30:09.057
Give me a second, will ya?

30:16.356 --> 30:19.567
I take it you've held up
your side of our bargain.

30:20.944 --> 30:21.945
Yeah.

30:22.779 --> 30:26.699
What's gonna happen to the Triad alliance
now that Davos is no longer a threat?

30:26.783 --> 30:27.909
The war is over.

30:28.618 --> 30:31.746
And we will never forget
what you and Daniel Rand did for us.

30:33.206 --> 30:37.585
For the lives lost to mean something,
you have to do more than just remember.

30:38.336 --> 30:41.297
You have to change.
Move into legitimate business.

30:41.381 --> 30:45.343
No more... No more protection rackets,
no more criminal activity.

30:45.426 --> 30:46.886
I want what you want.

30:47.929 --> 30:51.349
But neither of us are so naive
as to think that can happen overnight.

30:53.810 --> 30:56.020
No, we aren't.

30:58.565 --> 31:02.861
Which is why I will be watching,
should you backslide.

31:04.028 --> 31:05.405
Watch all you want.

31:06.906 --> 31:10.994
But I will brook no interference
from you or Daniel Rand.

31:13.413 --> 31:15.039
A balance, Ms. Wing.

31:16.541 --> 31:18.543
A delicate one, Mrs. Yang.

31:30.847 --> 31:32.390
[Bethany] Thanks, everyone, for coming.

31:32.473 --> 31:35.059
We'll be meeting here at the same time
on Wednesday and Friday.

31:35.810 --> 31:39.939
Hey. I know the meeting is about to end,
but I'd really like to say something.

31:40.023 --> 31:41.441
I have something to share.

31:43.318 --> 31:46.821
We have one more,
if you all don't have somewhere to be.

31:47.405 --> 31:48.406
[Ward] Thank you.

31:55.622 --> 31:57.290
My name is Ward. I'm an addict.

31:57.874 --> 31:59.417
[all] Hi, Ward.

31:59.500 --> 32:00.501
Um...

32:02.670 --> 32:06.215
I started coming here
because, uh, I wanted to change.

32:06.799 --> 32:08.468
But it's been so slow.

32:09.510 --> 32:12.430
It only comes in hard-won increments

32:12.513 --> 32:15.934
as small as the metric side of a ruler.
[chuckles]

32:17.101 --> 32:18.269
Uh...

32:19.520 --> 32:22.273
[sighs] That's not what I wanted to say...

32:23.608 --> 32:24.609
at all.

32:24.692 --> 32:26.110
Um...

32:26.194 --> 32:29.906
Shit. Sorry. This is just hard.

32:31.199 --> 32:32.325
Um...

32:34.327 --> 32:36.162
I'm not great with people.

32:37.163 --> 32:39.290
I'm terrible at relationships.

32:40.667 --> 32:43.920
I'm a son with no mother or father.

32:44.003 --> 32:46.631
I'm a brother with no sister.

32:46.714 --> 32:48.925
[sighs] And...

32:50.468 --> 32:52.512
I'm very deeply alone.

32:55.974 --> 32:57.892
I was in a bar a few days ago.

33:00.895 --> 33:04.482
I found myself doing what you do
in a place like that.

33:05.900 --> 33:08.569
And a friend of mine
that I care for deeply...

33:10.363 --> 33:16.411
she came to me in that awful place
and she asked me, "Who do you want to be?"

33:18.788 --> 33:20.999
I... I don't even know

33:22.583 --> 33:23.918
how to begin

33:24.460 --> 33:26.379
to consider that question.

33:27.672 --> 33:33.302
I have lived my life
in relation to others.

33:34.345 --> 33:37.265
And I have estimated my self-worth

33:38.599 --> 33:40.143
based on that equation.

33:41.394 --> 33:42.895
And the fact is

33:43.980 --> 33:47.650
that now all those relationships are gone.

33:49.360 --> 33:55.950
So I'm here to say to all of you
that I have no one.

34:02.165 --> 34:05.585
And I don't know myself.

34:08.546 --> 34:10.465
[sighs] So...

34:12.008 --> 34:13.718
Hello, Ward. [chuckles]

34:13.801 --> 34:15.261
Was your day as crap as mine?

34:15.344 --> 34:19.724
-Yeah, in fact, I know it was.
-[all laugh]

34:20.683 --> 34:22.018
Thank you for listening.

34:24.145 --> 34:25.897
Thank you for sharing, Ward.

34:36.783 --> 34:37.992
Hi, Bethany.

34:42.455 --> 34:43.581
Who told you?

34:43.664 --> 34:46.751
You did. I was here. And I heard you. [takes deep breath] It is mine, right?

34:50.463 --> 34:53.966
"It." Such a terrible pronoun.

34:58.179 --> 34:59.430
Say something.

34:59.972 --> 35:01.390
I planned on telling you.

35:01.474 --> 35:02.683
I'm sure you did.

35:03.226 --> 35:04.519
I just want you to know...

35:05.186 --> 35:07.563
[sighs] if this is one of those moments

35:07.647 --> 35:11.609
where life is telling me
what it wants from me,

35:11.692 --> 35:16.948
then I want to be there for this child.
I want to be there for you.

35:18.866 --> 35:20.243
No, Ward.

35:21.869 --> 35:26.124
It isn't fate. It isn't...
It isn't destiny. It's just what happened.

35:26.666 --> 35:28.251
Doesn't it mean something?

35:29.752 --> 35:32.839
Someone trying to tell us something?

35:33.381 --> 35:36.717
I believe in a higher power.

35:38.052 --> 35:41.139
But not one
that is necessarily instructive.

35:44.392 --> 35:46.519
I have to deal with the here and now.

35:46.602 --> 35:47.812
I'm here.

35:50.439 --> 35:54.193
I know that I've made terrible decisions.

35:55.736 --> 35:58.948
But... I believe,

36:00.408 --> 36:04.787
with help, moving forward,
I can make the right ones.

36:05.329 --> 36:06.539
I hope you do.

36:08.749 --> 36:10.209
And I hope you understand,

36:11.919 --> 36:13.754
I have to do this on my own.

36:24.682 --> 36:26.851
You don't believe
that I can be a better person.

36:26.934 --> 36:28.561
It's not me that has to believe.

36:31.522 --> 36:35.526
I have to take care of two people
from now on.

36:36.360 --> 36:38.487
That's all I can handle, okay?

36:38.571 --> 36:39.488
Bethany--

36:39.572 --> 36:41.657
You just said it in there a minute ago.

36:41.741 --> 36:43.367
You don't know yourself.

36:49.665 --> 36:51.417
I don't even like myself.

36:59.759 --> 37:01.052
Be well, Ward.

37:03.763 --> 37:05.973
It's not just a higher power
I have faith in.

37:46.055 --> 37:48.057
[alarm system beeping]

37:52.520 --> 37:53.437
[beeping stops]

38:03.239 --> 38:04.365
[Joy] Here's your money.

38:07.201 --> 38:08.202
Hi. Hi.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.832
Nicely played.
How long were you sitting in the dark?

38:13.416 --> 38:15.334
I figured either you'd be here
for the money

38:15.835 --> 38:17.712
or Davos would be here for me.

38:17.795 --> 38:19.505
He won't be bothering you anymore.

38:20.548 --> 38:22.049
Well, there's a silver lining.

38:23.926 --> 38:26.429
I was prepared to do
what we'd agreed, you know.

38:26.512 --> 38:29.348
But then Rand and the girl
and the detective showed up.

38:29.432 --> 38:30.808
And then Mary came out to play.

38:30.891 --> 38:33.394
I mean, she didn't hang around long,
but, oh, she was afraid.

38:33.477 --> 38:34.312
Her heart was all aflutter.

38:34.395 --> 38:38.232
And, anyway, by the time I was back
in the saddle, they'd arrested him, so...

38:38.316 --> 38:40.276
That's great. Stop.

38:41.193 --> 38:42.194
Huh.

38:43.112 --> 38:44.947
So I'm the loose end now?

38:45.031 --> 38:47.742
No. I'm just trying to be clear.

38:48.284 --> 38:51.912
This is the end.
You take the cash. The job is over.

38:52.580 --> 38:53.748
Like you once said,

38:53.831 --> 38:57.501
"We never met. You were never here.
This never happened." Deal?

38:58.044 --> 38:59.587
A deal is a deal...

39:02.214 --> 39:03.799
until it changes.

39:05.426 --> 39:09.305
You don't want to forget that I helped
your brother and came to save you, Joy.

39:09.388 --> 39:13.142
I'm not forgetting. I appreciate it.
But I just want this to be over.

39:13.225 --> 39:15.394
I need to get
back to some semblance of my life.

39:16.604 --> 39:19.857
Yeah. Sure you do.
'Cause you think you can.

39:19.940 --> 39:23.361
But the thing is, I can't.

39:25.237 --> 39:28.866
Not since I found out
who saved me in Sokovia.

39:30.743 --> 39:34.205
[clears throat] They kept me
in a concrete box, Joy.

39:34.288 --> 39:35.831
And took me out to question me.

39:35.915 --> 39:38.042
More often rape me. Torture me.

39:38.125 --> 39:40.211
Make me watch
while they killed the rest of my squad.

39:40.294 --> 39:42.338
And then, after 22 months, I was freed.

39:43.130 --> 39:45.508
I always thought Mary
convinced someone to get her out.

39:45.591 --> 39:48.260
And she thought I fought my way out.
Well, we were both wrong.

39:48.344 --> 39:49.678
What, are you trying to scare me?

39:50.513 --> 39:52.890
I almost died yesterday,
and I'm still standing, so...

40:00.231 --> 40:01.816
You're not afraid of me, Joy?

40:03.567 --> 40:04.652
Good.

40:04.735 --> 40:06.028
Because I am.

40:07.613 --> 40:11.283
"A bloody mess" is how the sergeant major
described the carnage at the camp.

40:11.367 --> 40:13.869
And Mary Walker's fingerprints
were on the knives.

40:14.453 --> 40:16.247
Poison doesn't know it's poison.

40:16.914 --> 40:18.541
I don't know what the hell that means.

40:18.624 --> 40:20.167
It means there's another alter.

40:20.251 --> 40:23.129
And even I don't know what triggers her,
but I do have a pretty good idea

40:23.212 --> 40:25.089
it might involve a gun
pointed at my heart.

40:27.967 --> 40:29.051
I just...

40:30.177 --> 40:32.054
I just want you to leave, Walker.

40:32.638 --> 40:34.223
And I like your taste in shoes.

40:36.392 --> 40:38.686
I think I'm gonna leave that money here
and draw it out later.

40:38.769 --> 40:41.397
You know, you're one of the few people
who knows both sides of me.

40:43.649 --> 40:44.817
I could use that.

40:44.900 --> 40:50.489
I could use your influence,
your connections... your reach.

40:53.242 --> 40:55.453
It's not over between us, Joy.

40:56.495 --> 40:58.164
Don't I get a say in that?

40:58.247 --> 41:00.666
That's one of the things
I love most about you...

41:02.334 --> 41:04.086
is your sense of humor.

41:11.844 --> 41:14.054
[door opens and closes]

41:25.274 --> 41:26.275
Danny? [Danny] <i>Colleen,</i>

41:48.547 --> 41:50.174
<i>Nothing ends without a new beginning.</i>

41:51.091 --> 41:54.011
<i>Just as any start is,</i>
<i>inevitably, a step towards an ending.</i>

41:55.513 --> 41:58.641
<i>But here, now, today,</i>

41:59.725 --> 42:01.143
<i>I have to consider...</i>

42:01.936 --> 42:03.062
<i>was he wrong?</i>

42:04.188 --> 42:06.565
<i>Or did I only ever know half the story?</i>

42:08.275 --> 42:10.819
<i>You have every right</i>
<i>to be angry with me, Colleen,</i>

42:10.903 --> 42:13.030
<i>for not telling you all this face-to-face.</i>

42:13.572 --> 42:16.617
<i>But I know that if I did, I'd never leave.</i>

42:17.952 --> 42:19.453
<i>And that is what I have to do.</i>

42:20.746 --> 42:21.747
<i>When I got home,</i>

42:21.830 --> 42:25.000
<i>I found something that made me think</i>
<i>there was a larger destiny at work.</i>

42:25.960 --> 42:27.336
<i>That silver medallion,</i>

42:27.920 --> 42:29.380
<i>I saw the other side.</i>

42:30.256 --> 42:32.299
<i>It was confirmation of something</i>
<i>that had been nagging me</i>

42:32.383 --> 42:34.843
<i>ever since Frank Choi</i>
<i>told us your mother's story.</i>

42:35.678 --> 42:39.139
<i>I've heard that story before, Colleen.</i>
<i>In K'un-Lun.</i>

42:39.682 --> 42:42.184
<i>When I was just a boy, Davos told me.</i>

42:42.935 --> 42:45.729
<i>A story about the first woman</i>
<i>to defeat the dragon.</i>

42:46.355 --> 42:48.065
<i>Her name was Wu Ao-Shi.</i>

42:48.148 --> 42:50.818
<i>You know her</i>
<i>as the Pirate Queen of Pinghai Bay.</i>

42:51.610 --> 42:53.988
<i>A woman who may very well</i>
<i>be your ancestor.</i>

42:55.573 --> 42:57.074
<i>Which means there may be a reason</i>

42:57.157 --> 42:59.702
<i>why I met a young woman</i>
<i>in the park hanging fliers.</i>

43:00.661 --> 43:03.289
<i>It may be that the destiny</i>
<i>that I believed was mine,</i>

43:04.248 --> 43:08.544
<i>was always hers, always yours,</i>
<i>from the start.</i>

43:10.045 --> 43:15.301
<i>We are the yin and yang, you and I.</i>
<i>In constant motion, but one and the same.</i>

43:16.427 --> 43:19.388
<i>I love you, Colleen. Always.</i>

43:21.140 --> 43:24.393
[Ward] This plane is not leaving
this runway. You hear me?

43:24.476 --> 43:25.936
And you tell Mr. Rand

43:26.020 --> 43:29.273
he's not going anywhere
unless he talks to me first.

43:29.356 --> 43:33.027
And don't give me any of this
"51% of the company" bullshit.

43:33.110 --> 43:36.113
I have the pull
to make your life a living hell.

43:36.196 --> 43:37.197
[Danny] Ward!

43:38.032 --> 43:39.366
What are you doing here?

43:39.450 --> 43:43.120
Katie called and told me
that you requested a flight to Asia.

43:43.704 --> 43:45.331
Where are you going, Danny?

43:47.207 --> 43:48.876
It's complicated, okay?

43:48.959 --> 43:53.339
Well, here's something simple.
I am standing between you and the plane.

43:54.340 --> 43:55.883
[both laugh]

43:56.425 --> 44:00.179
Don't try and kung fu me, man.
I can take a punch.

44:03.057 --> 44:05.809
Look, I have to understand
the legacy of the Iron Fist.

44:06.435 --> 44:07.686
And my place in it.

44:09.521 --> 44:13.192
Hai-Qing Yang helped Davos get
his hands on the corpse of an Iron Fist.

44:13.776 --> 44:16.445
Whoever supplied the body
may have the answers I need.

44:17.488 --> 44:18.947
Call them on a telephone.

44:19.031 --> 44:22.201
It's not that simple.
It's part of a larger journey.

44:23.369 --> 44:25.371
I gotta find my true path in this world.

44:25.954 --> 44:28.457
Not a bike path or a forest path...

44:28.540 --> 44:30.125
-[chuckles]
-...a true path.

44:30.209 --> 44:31.377
A true path.

44:33.587 --> 44:36.465
Listen, I want to be the brother
you and Joy need,

44:37.091 --> 44:38.634
the man Colleen deserves,

44:38.717 --> 44:41.387
the son who would have
made my parents proud.

44:43.138 --> 44:45.015
I want to be worthy of the Iron Fist.

44:46.558 --> 44:49.603
But until I truly know what I stand for...

44:51.647 --> 44:53.899
I can't trust myself
with that responsibility.

44:58.112 --> 44:59.530
I've gotta do this.

45:07.121 --> 45:08.122
Okay.

45:11.750 --> 45:13.168
Sure, sure.

45:16.213 --> 45:18.716
Go on then. Go on walkabout.

45:18.799 --> 45:22.302
I'll be right here,
running the company with your name on it.

45:22.386 --> 45:23.804
-Ward...
-Like I do.

45:23.887 --> 45:28.517
What? I didn't crash in K'un-Lun,
get raised by monks and fight a dragon.

45:28.600 --> 45:32.062
I got sent to an expensive boarding school
and learned how to play rugby.

45:32.146 --> 45:33.856
A sport no one gives a shit about.

45:33.939 --> 45:36.108
It could have just as easily been you
on that flight.

45:39.278 --> 45:40.487
Come with me.

45:41.071 --> 45:43.741
-What? Why would I do that?
-Why not?

45:44.283 --> 45:47.786
You already know who you are.
Why don't you find out who you could be?

45:47.870 --> 45:51.290
Uh, it's irresponsible.
You can't just up and leave.

45:51.832 --> 45:53.625
You can't run away from yourself. Maybe you'd be running towards yourself.

45:55.586 --> 45:56.879
What does that even mean?

45:56.962 --> 45:58.297
What does it mean to you?

45:58.380 --> 46:01.341
-Now, stop it. Don't Zen koan me.
-[laughs]

46:01.884 --> 46:04.052
Don't make light of it. It's a real thing.

46:04.136 --> 46:05.304
I know it is.

46:06.805 --> 46:08.182
[sniffles]

46:08.265 --> 46:09.725
That's why I'm telling you...

46:11.518 --> 46:12.770
you're coming with me.

46:23.572 --> 46:24.990
-[gunshot]
-[woman screams]

46:25.073 --> 46:26.700
[alarm ringing]

46:29.161 --> 46:30.496
[thug 1] Come on! Come on! Let's move!

46:37.002 --> 46:39.505
[whistles] Hey there!

46:42.049 --> 46:44.092
Uh... hey.

46:44.676 --> 46:46.804
You know this doesn't
have to go this way, right?

46:47.346 --> 46:48.388
[thug 2] Get out of the way!

46:48.472 --> 46:50.641
[car engine revving]

46:57.731 --> 46:59.733
[indistinct chatter]

47:01.026 --> 47:03.654
-[glass thuds]
-[man] More sake.

47:03.737 --> 47:05.364
-[fist thuds]
-More water.

47:06.490 --> 47:09.743
Look, I know your boss is selling
on the black market.

47:10.285 --> 47:13.121
[man] Our employer
is a legitimate businessman.

47:15.165 --> 47:17.084
Sure. Sure.

47:17.835 --> 47:19.503
We're all legitimate

47:19.586 --> 47:24.967
in a bar in Hokkaido at 4:00 a.m.

47:27.719 --> 47:29.012
[groans]

47:29.596 --> 47:34.351
Hancock 212.

47:35.477 --> 47:36.770
It's a shipping container.

47:37.855 --> 47:39.940
There was a corpse in a box,

47:40.482 --> 47:44.027
wearing a mask
with a dragon burned onto its chest.

47:44.570 --> 47:46.405
I wanna talk to the man who sent it.

47:47.322 --> 47:49.116
A guy named Orson Randall.

47:53.287 --> 47:54.955
Never heard of him.

47:56.290 --> 48:00.627
Look, you have no idea how hard
it's been to track down your boss.

48:01.253 --> 48:06.383
From Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur.
That mess in Jakarta.

48:09.553 --> 48:12.890
A shipment was stolen
from our employer's warehouse in Jakarta.

48:13.849 --> 48:15.851
Yeah, things went sideways.

48:23.734 --> 48:24.735
Wow.

48:26.153 --> 48:29.656
Look, you really don't want
to mess with me.

48:30.198 --> 48:31.909
What if I disagree?

48:34.828 --> 48:36.538
Then you'll have to deal with him.

48:37.456 --> 48:39.708
I thought you said
you had this handled, Ward.

48:40.542 --> 48:43.670
We can't know the future. Not completely.

48:43.754 --> 48:46.506
Our employer wants his property back.

48:49.134 --> 48:51.762
[Ward] Well, friend,
I'll let you field that one.

49:06.818 --> 49:07.945
[Danny] You mean these?

49:19.373 --> 49:20.958
[laughs]

49:24.336 --> 49:25.587
Don't try that again.

49:28.674 --> 49:30.676
[dramatic music playing]

50:42.914 --> 50:43.957
[Daredevil] I once believed

50:44.041 --> 50:46.585
that justice could be found
in a court of law...

50:46.668 --> 50:48.920
[church bell ringing]

50:49.004 --> 50:50.505
...and in the light of day.

50:53.175 --> 50:54.968
But I was fooling myself.

50:55.052 --> 50:56.762
[thunder rumbling]

50:56.845 --> 50:59.389
Darkness only responds to darkness.

51:01.683 --> 51:03.226
And the truth is...

51:04.811 --> 51:06.521
I'd rather die as the Devil
