[anxious breathing]

00:44.957 --> 00:46.133
GESTAPO 1: Move aside.

00:46.176 --> 00:49.571
GESTAPO 2: We are
looking for the girl.

00:49.614 --> 00:51.268
Where is the german?

00:51.312 --> 00:53.053
KERSTIN: The one you're
searching for, she

00:53.096 --> 00:55.794
returned to Lubec two days ago.

00:55.838 --> 00:57.709
GESTAPO 1: You
are Frau Schlegel?

00:57.753 --> 00:59.102
She is your child?

00:59.146 --> 01:00.408
KERSTIN: Yes, but she
doesn't live here.

01:00.451 --> 01:03.628
She lives with
her aunt in Lubec.

01:03.672 --> 01:05.413
You're making a mistake.

01:05.456 --> 01:09.678
Women like you,
you contaminate.

01:09.721 --> 01:14.248
If she's anything like her
mother, she'll be open also--

01:14.291 --> 01:15.858
to contaminate from within.

01:21.516 --> 01:24.954
You won't find her.

01:24.997 --> 01:26.956
Because she doesn't live here.

01:41.753 --> 01:44.321
Leyna, come They've gone.

01:58.901 --> 02:04.472
LEYNA [VOICEOVER]: Spring 1944.

02:04.515 --> 02:06.038
That was the year I turned 16.

02:09.520 --> 02:11.522
Children like me
from the Rhineland

02:11.566 --> 02:18.268
were known as Rhineland
bastards or "Hitler's problem,"

02:18.312 --> 02:21.184
because our German
nationality automatically

02:21.228 --> 02:24.709
came through our white mothers
even though our fathers

02:24.753 --> 02:27.103
were African and often absent.

02:31.499 --> 02:36.199
There were so few of us
that in my entire 16 years,

02:36.243 --> 02:39.202
I never saw another
soul like me.

02:39.246 --> 02:42.727
Happy Birthday, sweet girl.

02:42.771 --> 02:44.686
Thank you, Frau Heinrich.

02:44.729 --> 02:47.950
LEYNA [VOICEOVER]: Hitler
wanted to deal with us secretly,

02:47.993 --> 02:53.477
without being seen by Germany to
be attacking our Aryan mothers.

02:53.521 --> 02:58.178
So though we had a freedom
that the Jews did not have,

02:58.221 --> 03:02.225
still we had to be
guarded, especially

03:02.269 --> 03:04.923
once the Gestapo started
to visit us in Rudesheim.

03:08.275 --> 03:13.715
It wasn't that I had not
known I was different.

03:13.758 --> 03:20.330
It was that as I reached 16,
I really began to feel it.

03:20.374 --> 03:25.117
That was the year I realized
Hitler had a plan for us.

03:25.161 --> 03:26.858
Why are we going to Berlin?

03:26.902 --> 03:28.817
To be invisible.

03:28.860 --> 03:30.253
Stop talking, Koen.

03:30.297 --> 03:31.080
Read your book.

03:42.178 --> 03:45.703
I have my drawing
book, but no pencil.

03:45.747 --> 03:47.357
I can't draw without one.

03:47.401 --> 03:49.707
You want a pencil?

03:49.751 --> 03:54.408
I think that I might be able
to help you, little man.

03:54.451 --> 03:55.670
Thank you.

03:55.713 --> 03:56.410
He's restless.

03:56.453 --> 03:57.367
He's a boy.

03:57.411 --> 03:58.760
We never grow out of it.

04:03.721 --> 04:04.592
Your papers?

04:04.635 --> 04:07.116
Yes, of course.

04:07.159 --> 04:08.726
I have all of our papers.

04:08.770 --> 04:09.379
Here.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.219
Schlegel?

04:23.263 --> 04:23.872
Yes.

04:35.840 --> 04:36.711
Invisible.

04:46.198 --> 04:48.549
Here is not like the Rhineland.

04:48.592 --> 04:50.812
They're not bothered
with children like you

04:50.855 --> 04:54.598
or this talk of fixing you.

04:54.642 --> 04:56.774
Life will be good again.

04:56.818 --> 05:00.300
I promise.

05:00.343 --> 05:03.346
We have a new girl
joining us today.

05:03.390 --> 05:09.004
Her name is Leyna Schlegel.

05:09.047 --> 05:09.700
Stand up.

05:12.834 --> 05:19.797
Schlegel is a good German name,
but your face, so un-German.

05:19.841 --> 05:23.061
Leyna has facial
features in common

05:23.105 --> 05:26.369
with people of which continent?

05:26.413 --> 05:27.631
Greta.

05:27.675 --> 05:28.806
Africa.

05:28.850 --> 05:34.377
Indeed So how
does a girl like you

05:34.421 --> 05:36.553
come to have a name so
Germanic as Schlegel?

05:40.644 --> 05:44.300
Schlegel is my mother's name.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.823
And what is your
father's name?

05:50.437 --> 05:53.440
When will you tell
me about my father?

05:53.483 --> 05:55.006
He was black from head to toe.

05:57.531 --> 05:59.184
LEYNA: I want to
know who he was.

05:59.228 --> 06:01.186
Leyna.

06:01.230 --> 06:02.884
You know everything.

06:02.927 --> 06:05.974
I was just a little
older than you.

06:06.017 --> 06:06.714
Made mistakes.

06:06.757 --> 06:07.628
Mistakes?

06:07.671 --> 06:10.326
Not you.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.110
Koen, get me some water, please.

06:18.682 --> 06:20.118
He was a good soldier.

06:20.162 --> 06:22.556
But I've told you all this.

06:22.599 --> 06:23.818
I don't know what else.

06:23.861 --> 06:25.820
Why did you not marry?

06:25.863 --> 06:29.389
Mr. Mueller slapped me
yesterday, because he told me

06:29.432 --> 06:32.827
that you were the first of
all people who are white

06:32.870 --> 06:35.438
and the worse of
all people, black.

06:35.482 --> 06:37.875
That's what a Mulatto is.

06:37.919 --> 06:41.444
But I told him that's not true.

06:41.488 --> 06:43.403
To me you are the
best of everything.

06:46.493 --> 06:49.539
Your hair is dirty.

06:49.583 --> 06:50.671
I'll wash it for you tonight.

06:55.763 --> 06:59.244
[bell ringing]

07:03.379 --> 07:04.293
Heil Hitler.

07:04.336 --> 07:04.946
Heil Hitler.

07:33.365 --> 07:36.368
Hey, shouldn't you be
going with them, monkey?

08:14.232 --> 08:16.626
HIDA: Wilhelm just
returned from Vienna.

08:16.670 --> 08:18.367
KERSTIN: But he
knows we're coming?

08:18.410 --> 08:19.411
Yes, of course.

08:19.455 --> 08:20.325
I told him.

08:25.113 --> 08:26.418
She actually is beautiful.

08:29.465 --> 08:32.990
And he looks just like Father.

08:33.034 --> 08:33.817
Go on, Leyna.

08:33.861 --> 08:34.514
Sit down.

08:44.828 --> 08:47.265
I didn't expect you
with the children.

08:47.309 --> 08:48.963
Today they saw a
Negro at the door.

08:49.006 --> 08:50.878
Tomorrow it will
be a Jew, you know?

08:50.921 --> 08:51.835
Nobody saw us, Hida.

09:02.454 --> 09:04.761
Leyna, go ahead of me.

09:04.805 --> 09:07.459
See if you can pick up
a good loaf of bread

09:07.503 --> 09:09.505
before the store closes.

09:09.549 --> 09:10.462
Take Koen with you.

09:13.814 --> 09:16.556
Leyna, please, use the back.

09:26.391 --> 09:28.176
Kerstin, I want
you to understand,

09:28.219 --> 09:31.832
I have nothing
against your family.

09:31.875 --> 09:36.010
And a choice between your
child and us, well, I know,

09:36.053 --> 09:37.533
it's no choice at all.

09:37.577 --> 09:40.449
But I spilled blood
for the Kaiser.

09:40.492 --> 09:45.019
And last month they kept my
sick father over two nights

09:45.062 --> 09:48.370
because someone convinced
them he had a Jewish mother.

09:48.413 --> 09:50.981
And now you bring
your Negro here.

09:51.025 --> 09:54.985
You compromised me, us, your
sister, without any regard.

09:55.029 --> 09:57.466
Wilhelm.

09:57.509 --> 10:04.560
Listen for just a moment and you
will never hear from us again.

10:04.604 --> 10:05.430
I need papers.

10:05.474 --> 10:07.389
Kerstin.

10:07.432 --> 10:10.566
Something to say Leyna
has been sterilized.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.394
You really are quite unique.

10:12.437 --> 10:13.787
Wilhelm, you have access.

10:13.830 --> 10:17.617
A Gestapo document declaring
her physically changed.

10:17.660 --> 10:20.054
You can do this.

10:20.097 --> 10:20.881
I know you can.

10:20.924 --> 10:21.969
You should leave, Kerstin.

10:22.012 --> 10:23.666
Hida, please.

10:23.710 --> 10:25.886
I didn't think the order
would extend to Berlin.

10:25.929 --> 10:28.279
I hoped she would be safe here.

10:28.323 --> 10:29.541
But two days ago they came.

10:29.585 --> 10:31.152
She was out.

10:31.195 --> 10:33.067
I told them she carries the
papers with her but I'm afraid.

10:36.723 --> 10:40.857
I'm afraid that they will
take her from the streets,

10:40.901 --> 10:44.165
from the school, anywhere
that I can't protect her.

10:44.208 --> 10:45.470
Leyna, let's go.

10:45.514 --> 10:47.211
HIDA: Why did you
put her in school?

10:47.255 --> 10:49.387
What's the matter with you?

10:49.431 --> 10:50.693
KERSTIN: I can't hide her.

10:50.737 --> 10:52.347
If not school,
then labor service.

10:52.390 --> 10:53.740
Who knows where she would end?

10:53.783 --> 10:55.611
All the girls must
do labor service.

10:55.655 --> 10:56.917
She's no different.

10:56.960 --> 10:58.701
You want her to be special?

10:58.745 --> 11:00.660
No.

11:00.703 --> 11:05.447
I want her to be
like everyone else.

11:05.490 --> 11:06.274
Unremarkable.

11:09.538 --> 11:13.716
Then she will not escape this
war as if it never happened.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.196
None of us will
manage that, Kerstin.

11:22.638 --> 11:23.944
KOEN: Gunter.

11:23.987 --> 11:25.641
Where?

11:25.685 --> 11:29.340
Where did that voice come from?

11:29.384 --> 11:30.298
Ah.

11:30.341 --> 11:31.778
Some bread, please, Gunter.

11:31.821 --> 11:32.735
How are you?

11:32.779 --> 11:33.605
Good?

11:33.649 --> 11:34.606
Settling in?

11:34.650 --> 11:36.347
I miss home.

11:36.391 --> 11:37.566
Morning.

11:37.609 --> 11:42.136
Ah, is that a,
yes, I think a smile.

11:42.179 --> 11:44.268
That's better.

11:44.312 --> 11:45.356
There are people waiting.

11:48.925 --> 11:54.888
[speaking german]

11:54.931 --> 11:58.239
I always keep good come
back, but you can have it.

11:58.282 --> 11:59.631
Now listen to me.

11:59.675 --> 12:01.677
If your sister
forgets to smile, you

12:01.721 --> 12:03.723
remind her of Gunter's face.

12:03.766 --> 12:05.986
It's funny, yes?

12:06.029 --> 12:06.638
Yes.

12:15.560 --> 12:18.346
Can I go now?

12:18.389 --> 12:20.043
Yes, you can go
with the other boys.

12:20.087 --> 12:22.785
Go on then.

12:22.829 --> 12:23.438
Koen.

12:30.010 --> 12:32.142
Koen.

12:32.186 --> 12:33.883
I have no choice.

12:33.927 --> 12:35.798
The law says you must go.

12:35.842 --> 12:41.543
But where you are going, they
will teach you many things.

12:41.586 --> 12:44.676
Lots will make sense
and feel right,

12:44.720 --> 12:47.070
but so much will be
confusing because it

12:47.114 --> 12:53.250
will be different to the
things you learn here at home.

12:53.294 --> 12:56.819
But I want you to
understand that nobody

12:56.863 --> 12:59.909
can know a son
better than a mother,

12:59.953 --> 13:02.216
no teacher, no group leader.

13:05.523 --> 13:09.701
I hope, Koen, that you
choose never to forget this,

13:09.745 --> 13:15.751
that you keep what I teach
you in here and here.

13:19.494 --> 13:21.104
Do you understand me, Koen?

13:28.198 --> 13:31.723
[chatter]

13:53.006 --> 13:53.745
Leyna!

13:53.789 --> 13:54.790
I didn't see you.

13:54.834 --> 13:55.530
Leyna?

13:55.573 --> 13:57.010
Sorry.

13:57.053 --> 14:00.100
Let me look at you.

14:00.143 --> 14:01.014
You should be more careful.

14:06.367 --> 14:09.631
I need to get you home so
we can clean these wounds.

14:14.723 --> 14:15.593
[WHISPERING] I'm sorry.

14:31.305 --> 14:33.176
Why are you in the
building so early?

14:33.220 --> 14:36.223
The leaders in meeting
before the boys arrive.

14:36.266 --> 14:37.746
I told them we need to.

14:37.789 --> 14:40.270
Are you making
problems for yourself?

14:40.314 --> 14:43.404
The older ones are taking
pocket money from the others.

14:43.447 --> 14:45.014
Yesterday I had mothers
screaming in my ears.

14:45.058 --> 14:45.710
Wait!

14:49.062 --> 14:50.367
Ask.

14:50.411 --> 14:51.194
Hm.

14:51.238 --> 14:51.891
Don't take.

15:01.161 --> 15:02.727
We're a little
late, Frau Nagel.

15:02.771 --> 15:04.555
I'm sorry.

15:04.599 --> 15:06.166
What happened to you?

15:06.209 --> 15:08.820
KERSTIN: A little hooligan
ran her over with his bike.

15:08.864 --> 15:11.171
It was an accident.

15:11.214 --> 15:12.389
What do you say, Koen?

15:12.433 --> 15:13.695
Thank you, Frau Nagel.

15:13.738 --> 15:16.916
And next time, I kick
your ass at chess, huh?

15:20.310 --> 15:22.791
A gentleman asked
me to take it for you.

15:22.834 --> 15:25.272
He was at your door
while you were gone.

15:25.315 --> 15:29.537
I ask him his name, but
he didn't want to tell me.

15:29.580 --> 15:30.190
Wilhelm.

15:45.379 --> 15:46.771
Hida must never know.

15:46.815 --> 15:48.208
Here, take them.

15:48.251 --> 15:52.125
A set of the doctor's
papers has also been filed.

15:52.168 --> 15:53.604
Who?

15:53.648 --> 15:56.433
A connection in the
municipality of Rudesheim,

15:56.477 --> 15:57.782
one who is critical
of the regime.

15:57.826 --> 16:00.568
A communist?

16:00.611 --> 16:03.223
You have communist contacts?

16:03.266 --> 16:05.877
There are more
papers inside that

16:05.921 --> 16:08.402
must be archived in Rudesheim.

16:08.445 --> 16:12.101
Have them signed and
returned to me as instructed.

16:12.145 --> 16:16.584
And then you must forget
that you ever had a sister.

16:39.259 --> 16:39.911
Here.

16:54.491 --> 16:57.146
[chuckling]

16:57.190 --> 16:58.060
What?

16:58.104 --> 16:59.105
Nothing.

16:59.148 --> 17:02.151
You polish like
your Uncle Harry--

17:02.195 --> 17:05.111
like a girl.

17:05.154 --> 17:10.071
Oh, well Uncle Harry
told me I polish like you.

17:10.116 --> 17:12.031
When you're finished, go
and get yourself cleaned up.

17:12.074 --> 17:15.817
You have mud in your hair.

17:15.859 --> 17:16.818
My targets were
excellent today.

17:21.083 --> 17:25.740
I have to go to Hamburg
tonight but Sunday,

17:25.782 --> 17:26.915
Sunday we'll catch
some fish, yes?

17:55.987 --> 18:00.122
I have papers for you.

18:00.166 --> 18:04.126
You should carry them
with you wherever you go.

18:04.170 --> 18:07.042
They will protect you.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.087
Where did you--

18:08.130 --> 18:13.048
They're false,
but they're enough.

18:13.092 --> 18:13.701
No one will know.

18:20.142 --> 18:24.015
Wilhelm needs you
to sign these also.

18:24.059 --> 18:25.626
If I send them back
to him, he will

18:25.669 --> 18:29.586
make sure it's in the right
place for us to be left alone.

18:29.630 --> 18:31.501
What is it?

18:31.545 --> 18:34.417
A declaration
that you will not

18:34.461 --> 18:36.115
commit the crime
of racial mixing

18:36.158 --> 18:37.377
with anyone of German blood.

18:40.554 --> 18:42.164
I am of German blood.

18:42.208 --> 18:44.253
It's just a signature
to keep them away.

18:44.297 --> 18:45.646
It means nothing.

18:45.689 --> 18:47.648
It means something surely
or why should I sign?

18:51.260 --> 18:51.913
I won't.

18:55.395 --> 18:56.570
Fine.

18:56.613 --> 18:58.311
Then they will come
for you, Leyna,

18:58.354 --> 19:02.576
and they will make you sign,
not false, empty papers.

19:02.619 --> 19:07.407
Real ones, and not before
they have fixed you in reality

19:07.450 --> 19:09.104
and cut your insides to do so.

19:21.899 --> 19:23.379
Neither you nor
your brother entered

19:23.423 --> 19:26.513
this world without pain.

19:26.556 --> 19:31.953
But I could not be in this
life without you both.

19:31.996 --> 19:32.997
You should also
know the blessing

19:33.041 --> 19:34.173
of motherhood one day, Leyna.

19:37.176 --> 19:40.396
I want that for you.

19:40.440 --> 19:43.704
If you do not sign,
they will do to you

19:43.747 --> 19:44.835
what can never be undone.

19:47.925 --> 19:52.452
You will be who
they have made you.

19:52.495 --> 19:55.542
What was the treaty that
enabled Poland to take

19:55.585 --> 19:57.283
this land from the empire?

19:57.326 --> 19:58.240
Anna?

19:58.284 --> 19:59.285
Versailles.

19:59.328 --> 20:00.895
Schlegel.

20:00.938 --> 20:05.116
The five principle leaders were
signatories to this treaty?

20:05.160 --> 20:06.117
Heil Hitler.

20:06.161 --> 20:07.684
OFFICER: Heil Hitler.

20:07.728 --> 20:09.251
STUDENTS: Heil Hitler.

20:09.295 --> 20:09.904
Sit.

20:22.351 --> 20:23.439
Schlegel, stand.

20:23.483 --> 20:24.135
Come.

20:27.530 --> 20:28.357
Leave your books.

20:28.401 --> 20:30.141
You won't need them anymore.

20:30.185 --> 20:30.838
And take your bag.

20:58.126 --> 21:01.042
They didn't hurt you.

21:01.085 --> 21:02.565
That's all that matters.

21:06.352 --> 21:08.049
They can force you
from school, but they

21:08.092 --> 21:10.878
can't stop you learning.

21:10.921 --> 21:12.706
You'll learn here at home.

21:16.623 --> 21:18.451
But you will be
conscripted to work now.

21:30.245 --> 21:31.986
I was proud of how
you worked today.

21:32.029 --> 21:34.205
You're growing so quickly.

21:34.249 --> 21:36.773
I have a coat that will
fit you nicely now.

21:47.741 --> 21:50.004
Drive us home?

21:50.047 --> 21:51.353
No, thank you.

21:51.397 --> 21:52.049
I-- I'll cycle.

22:12.592 --> 22:13.201
Oh, please.

22:19.816 --> 22:23.211
You followed us home.

22:23.254 --> 22:25.344
I wanted to know
if you're all right.

22:25.387 --> 22:25.996
I am.

22:30.958 --> 22:34.048
What are you looking at?

22:34.091 --> 22:35.179
I don't know, your bruise.

22:44.711 --> 22:46.539
I'll see you.

22:46.582 --> 22:47.191
What's your name?

22:58.289 --> 23:00.335
OFFICER 2: Gunter,
[speaking german]..

23:03.817 --> 23:06.776
Gunter!

23:06.820 --> 23:09.562
Take them off.

23:09.605 --> 23:10.867
Take them off.

23:20.616 --> 23:21.269
Off!

23:30.583 --> 23:34.717
They didn't circumcise
you good enough, Jew.

23:34.761 --> 23:35.675
I can fix that.

23:44.858 --> 23:45.772
WOMAN 1: What happened?

23:45.815 --> 23:46.773
He was a Jew?

23:46.816 --> 23:48.383
MAN 1: Printing leaflets.

23:48.427 --> 23:49.732
WOMAN 2: He was plotting
with other students.

23:49.776 --> 23:51.430
MAN 2: He wore a crucifix
like it was a badge.

23:51.473 --> 23:53.388
Running with some
rotten Zionist group.

24:04.573 --> 24:08.838
I heard some people
outside Gunter's store.

24:08.882 --> 24:10.884
Something happened to him today.

24:10.927 --> 24:12.668
I know.

24:12.712 --> 24:13.539
I was there.

24:13.582 --> 24:14.191
I saw it.

24:17.064 --> 24:20.502
He was touching the bread.

24:20.546 --> 24:22.504
But he was Jewish.

24:22.548 --> 24:23.462
Don't be stupid, Koen.

24:23.505 --> 24:24.941
He was good Jew.

24:24.985 --> 24:26.029
Leyna.

24:26.073 --> 24:28.379
Good Jew?

24:28.423 --> 24:31.426
He was a human being.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.689
If I forbade you from
sharing the streets with me

24:33.733 --> 24:36.170
because your face is
freckled, should my words make

24:36.213 --> 24:38.433
you any less of a human being?

24:38.477 --> 24:40.087
Should that mean that
anyone should shoot

24:40.130 --> 24:41.262
you in the street like a dog?

24:47.573 --> 24:48.443
I'm sorry.

24:52.142 --> 24:55.668
I'm sorry you had to
see such a thing, Leyna.

24:55.711 --> 24:58.540
Also to you, Koen.

24:58.584 --> 25:01.761
It's not your fault.
It's my job to protect

25:01.804 --> 25:04.241
you from the things you hear,
even the things you think.

25:11.161 --> 25:13.424
A Waffen SS man.

25:13.468 --> 25:15.905
He came to speak to
us in training today.

25:15.949 --> 25:19.082
He told me my
skills are superior.

25:19.126 --> 25:20.649
He wishes to speak
with me further.

25:20.693 --> 25:22.608
What was his name?

25:22.651 --> 25:24.174
Leiber.

25:24.218 --> 25:25.872
Section leader.

25:25.915 --> 25:31.486
Tell me when does Leiber
plan to speak to me?

25:31.530 --> 25:34.141
I don't think they're
asking you to fight.

25:34.184 --> 25:36.926
And are you asking them
why they are not out there

25:36.970 --> 25:40.582
fighting themselves these men
who walk around recruiting you

25:40.626 --> 25:43.280
idiots?

25:43.324 --> 25:44.891
Why are you angry?

25:44.934 --> 25:46.719
It's easy to hit the target
when no one is attacking you,

25:46.762 --> 25:48.285
Lutz.

25:48.329 --> 25:51.506
You think there's time for
practice out there in the east?

25:51.550 --> 25:55.292
Out there the enemy is real
and his only target is you.

25:55.336 --> 25:56.946
This isn't a game to me.

25:56.990 --> 25:59.732
I am training hard.

25:59.775 --> 26:00.602
Everyone can see it.

26:04.650 --> 26:10.612
I fought in the last war
for four years, and when I got

26:10.656 --> 26:15.661
back Germany was even
worse than when I left.

26:15.704 --> 26:16.662
No work.

26:16.705 --> 26:17.445
Debt.

26:17.488 --> 26:19.708
Hunger.

26:19.752 --> 26:22.624
Like you, we ran willingly
towards our death.

26:22.668 --> 26:26.628
Towards protecting
the-- the Homeland.

26:26.672 --> 26:30.501
Like fools, we didn't
ask a single question.

26:30.545 --> 26:34.593
And all those men,
comrades that I ate with,

26:34.636 --> 26:37.639
slept with, pissed with--
they died for nothing.

26:37.683 --> 26:39.119
Do you understand me?
[ANGRILY] For nothing!

26:46.082 --> 26:48.302
We were humiliated, cheated.

26:48.345 --> 26:52.523
But this war, this war is ours.

26:52.567 --> 26:54.917
You cannot make a difference.

26:54.961 --> 26:57.528
That's not true.

26:57.572 --> 26:59.008
ANNOUNCER [ON
RADIO]: Germany will

26:59.052 --> 27:02.925
be freed from the Gestapo
hyenas, the SS murderers,

27:02.969 --> 27:05.232
and anyone who believes
in the filth of Hitler,

27:05.275 --> 27:06.668
of National Socialism--

27:06.712 --> 27:10.237
[chatter]

27:10.280 --> 27:13.240
--and this repulsive system.

27:13.283 --> 27:15.459
We will see the
end-- not of you,

27:15.503 --> 27:18.854
not of Germany, for the fight is
not against the German people.

27:18.898 --> 27:20.464
Leyna.

27:20.508 --> 27:21.770
ANNOUNCER [ON RADIO]: On the
contrary, Britain fights to--

27:21.814 --> 27:23.380
LEYNA: I--

27:23.424 --> 27:24.730
ANNOUNCER [ON RADIO]: --relieve
you from the monstrous

27:24.773 --> 27:26.557
hands of a dictator--

27:26.601 --> 27:27.994
Mother, I just
need some fresh air.

27:28.037 --> 27:29.430
ANNOUNCER [ON RADIO]: --who
convinced you he would

27:29.473 --> 27:30.561
free Germany, and instead--

27:30.605 --> 27:31.693
Leyna.

27:31.737 --> 27:32.607
ANNOUNCER [ON RADIO]:
--has broken it.

27:40.876 --> 27:41.790
She's a negro.

27:47.753 --> 27:48.405
Leyna.

28:09.035 --> 28:19.045
HITLER YOUTH:
[singing in german]

28:50.250 --> 28:50.859
Leyna?

28:55.298 --> 28:56.125
That's your name?

28:59.215 --> 29:01.522
Why did you come?

29:01.565 --> 29:04.220
You could get into
a lot of trouble.

29:04.264 --> 29:05.178
SS OFFICER: Heil Hitler!

29:05.221 --> 29:06.222
I wanted to see
what it's like.

29:06.266 --> 29:08.485
ALL: Heil Hitler!

29:08.529 --> 29:10.966
See what he does here.

29:11.010 --> 29:13.273
Koen.

29:13.316 --> 29:15.014
He's my brother.

29:15.057 --> 29:16.972
I know.

29:17.016 --> 29:18.931
I have seen him with you.

29:18.974 --> 29:21.020
Were you spying on us?

29:21.063 --> 29:21.716
Only once.

29:25.241 --> 29:28.114
He's German.

29:28.157 --> 29:29.028
Of course.

29:29.071 --> 29:36.731
SS OFFICER: [speaking german]

29:36.775 --> 29:39.647
I've seen a lady
that looks like you.

29:39.690 --> 29:42.171
In a photograph.

29:42.215 --> 29:47.350
Well not really a photograph.

29:47.394 --> 29:49.439
My father, he has a gramophone.

29:49.483 --> 29:54.880
He hides jazz records, but I've
heard them playing quietly.

29:54.923 --> 29:57.839
Sometimes, late at night,
when I'm in my room,

29:57.883 --> 29:59.362
if I press my ear to
the floor, I hear.

30:03.802 --> 30:04.628
Negermusik.

30:08.328 --> 30:09.198
Isn't that what it's called?

30:12.636 --> 30:13.202
It's not allowed.

30:17.467 --> 30:22.298
[SINGING] When we're
in a friendly situation,

30:22.342 --> 30:28.783
my conversation
might not be smart.

30:28.827 --> 30:33.701
But if we're to have a
perfect understanding,

30:33.744 --> 30:36.878
let's call a heart a heart.

30:40.969 --> 30:43.189
On the cover of one of the
magazines there's a lady.

30:43.232 --> 30:44.712
She's like you.

30:44.755 --> 30:48.324
Kind of beautiful.

31:01.555 --> 31:04.863
You'll get into trouble
singing those songs.

31:04.906 --> 31:06.473
I'll just have to be careful.

31:06.516 --> 31:07.126
Like my father.

31:21.792 --> 31:22.402
Come on.

31:33.979 --> 31:36.590
Have you ever been up there?

31:36.633 --> 31:39.680
Into those hills?

31:39.723 --> 31:42.378
It's the quietest
place on earth.

31:42.422 --> 31:44.293
I used to go up there
to collect caterpillars,

31:44.337 --> 31:47.253
with my father and my mother.

31:47.296 --> 31:48.994
You can see all of Berlin
from that one place.

31:52.562 --> 31:56.218
[geese quacking]

31:56.262 --> 31:57.089
Did you run away?

31:59.395 --> 32:00.222
Run away?

32:03.312 --> 32:05.793
It's just your
mother, she is--

32:10.363 --> 32:13.192
She's not Jewish.

32:13.235 --> 32:16.195
No, I know, but--

32:16.238 --> 32:18.545
your father.

32:18.588 --> 32:20.851
He-- He's a negro.

32:23.811 --> 32:27.075
LEYNA: Have you ever
swam in the night?

32:27.119 --> 32:28.947
You know, when it's so
dark you can see nothing.

32:34.996 --> 32:39.000
I always thought it
would be so wonderful.

32:39.044 --> 32:41.046
Then why have
you never done it?

32:44.875 --> 32:48.270
In Rudesheim I'd
swim every week.

32:48.314 --> 32:50.403
There were many Jews.

32:50.446 --> 32:51.839
They were told they
couldn't use the pool.

32:55.147 --> 33:01.849
And then-- I was told I
couldn't use it either.

33:01.892 --> 33:04.852
It's been a long
time, that's all.

33:04.895 --> 33:06.245
I have dreams that I'm drowning.

33:13.992 --> 33:15.558
You just have to get
used to the water again.

33:24.393 --> 33:25.481
[laughter]

33:25.525 --> 33:26.830
You can jump in with me.

33:33.141 --> 33:33.881
Now the next--

33:33.924 --> 33:37.102
[giggling, splashing]

33:48.678 --> 33:49.549
SS OFFICER: Heil Hitler.

33:57.165 --> 33:58.514
Leyna.

33:58.558 --> 33:59.254
Leyna!

33:59.298 --> 34:00.299
Leyna?

34:00.342 --> 34:01.082
Leyna!

34:01.126 --> 34:02.127
Leyna!

34:02.170 --> 34:05.130
Leyna.

34:05.173 --> 34:08.393
[heavy breathing]

34:22.538 --> 34:24.670
Here.

34:24.714 --> 34:26.498
This bit you need to
know where you're going.

34:26.542 --> 34:28.978
[chuckle]

34:29.023 --> 34:30.458
I can't believe I
lent you my bike.

34:34.724 --> 34:36.552
My mother had them made for us.

34:36.596 --> 34:37.639
For me and father.

34:37.684 --> 34:41.121
Does she have one too?

34:41.166 --> 34:42.862
She's dead.

34:42.906 --> 34:45.213
Oh, I--

34:45.257 --> 34:47.911
I'm sorry.

34:47.955 --> 34:50.523
Is that why you come here?

34:50.565 --> 34:51.176
To think of her?

34:54.004 --> 34:57.269
Sometimes.

34:57.312 --> 35:00.881
Mostly I think of what would
it would be like to fight.

35:00.924 --> 35:05.277
To stand up for Germany,
like my father did.

35:05.320 --> 35:08.845
Do you think you
could take a life?

35:08.889 --> 35:11.457
Kill a human being?

35:11.500 --> 35:13.807
Of course I could.

35:13.850 --> 35:15.678
I could kill a Russian
soldier with ease.

35:18.420 --> 35:22.990
LEYNA: Ooh, my mother will
think I've been up to something.

35:23.033 --> 35:24.731
Use my jumper.

35:24.774 --> 35:25.384
It's easier.

35:32.652 --> 35:34.306
Aren't you afraid?

35:34.349 --> 35:36.177
Of what?

35:36.221 --> 35:37.918
Fighting.

35:37.961 --> 35:39.659
War.

35:39.702 --> 35:40.877
Does the war frighten you?

35:40.921 --> 35:43.576
Yes.

35:43.619 --> 35:45.665
My father fought in the war.

35:45.708 --> 35:46.405
He did?

35:46.448 --> 35:47.101
For Germany?

35:50.235 --> 35:50.844
Of course.

--from the western front.

36:19.829 --> 36:21.179
The victory included--

36:25.313 --> 36:29.448
You told me he was
sent here to fight.

36:29.491 --> 36:31.754
You didn't tell me he was
sent here to fight us!

36:39.022 --> 36:40.981
It's his language!

36:41.024 --> 36:43.679
He was part of the
Occupation by the time we met.

36:43.723 --> 36:45.333
He didn't fight you.

36:45.377 --> 36:47.944
Or me.

36:47.988 --> 36:50.077
Of course he did.

36:50.120 --> 36:54.908
I am German, even if you
want to pretend you are not.

36:54.951 --> 36:57.693
Even if you want me
to pretend I'm not.

36:57.737 --> 37:00.479
I loved him.

37:00.522 --> 37:02.829
It was from that
place that you came.

37:02.872 --> 37:06.180
A place even Koen cannot claim.

37:06.224 --> 37:09.879
You have made
me an enemy twice.

37:09.923 --> 37:11.664
If you think I've
made you the enemy,

37:11.707 --> 37:14.928
Leyna, then look around you!

37:14.971 --> 37:16.277
Look, Leyna.

37:16.321 --> 37:19.454
And the next time you are
with that son of a Nazi,

37:19.498 --> 37:21.282
you know this--

37:21.326 --> 37:26.374
If his father catches you
with his boy, he'll kill him.

37:26.418 --> 37:28.028
Before he comes and kills us!

37:31.336 --> 37:34.513
[chatter]

37:56.883 --> 38:00.495
I've forgotten my gloves.

38:00.539 --> 38:01.191
I'll wait.

38:04.499 --> 38:06.327
No, you go on.

38:06.371 --> 38:07.285
I'll be just a moment.

38:10.592 --> 38:11.332
It's your choice, Leyna.

38:37.445 --> 38:40.187
You're always here.

38:40.230 --> 38:41.449
Outside the factory.

38:46.715 --> 38:48.369
Are you cold?

38:48.413 --> 38:50.371
No.

38:50.415 --> 38:52.591
Are you?

38:52.634 --> 38:54.244
Yes, it's the coldest summer.

38:57.552 --> 39:00.686
I've lost my gloves.

39:00.729 --> 39:02.122
I told my mother I left them.

[heavy breathing]

40:07.883 --> 40:11.147
[planes flying overhead]

40:15.674 --> 40:17.023
I have to go.

40:17.066 --> 40:19.460
I don't want my mother
to be more upset with me.

40:19.504 --> 40:20.809
I wanted to give
you something.

40:28.513 --> 40:30.689
Cheese.

40:30.732 --> 40:33.169
Maybe you could enjoy it
with Koen and your mother.

40:46.835 --> 40:49.751
I thought you had gone.

40:49.795 --> 40:53.146
My mother didn't
wait for me, Leyna.

40:53.189 --> 40:57.411
And that's just how
I became your mother,

40:57.455 --> 40:59.718
chasing the same
impossibility you are chasing.

41:02.938 --> 41:06.333
The first time your
father looked at me,

41:06.376 --> 41:07.987
I thought my heart
would never beat again

41:08.030 --> 41:09.205
unless he loved me forever.

41:12.252 --> 41:15.995
He was ripped away
from me, Leyna.

41:16.038 --> 41:18.954
And all I had left was you.

41:18.998 --> 41:22.262
The best of everything.

41:22.305 --> 41:24.220
So you think I could
ever leave you?

41:29.095 --> 41:31.750
For each of us there is someone.

41:34.927 --> 41:37.190
For me it's you, Leyna.

41:37.233 --> 41:40.541
The gift from your father.

41:40.585 --> 41:44.240
Koen is my heart, you know that.

41:47.461 --> 41:50.769

42:58.010 --> 43:00.055
Do you still love me?

43:00.099 --> 43:01.361
No.

of more use elsewhere.

We need every man we can get.

Oh, so you do realize that
our men are freezing to death

46:13.118 --> 46:14.554
on the Russian front?

46:14.597 --> 46:16.469
They are dying with honor.

46:16.512 --> 46:17.426
It's not for nothing.

No, it's for blind delusion.

May I go now?

46:25.391 --> 46:27.088
Lutz, wait.

46:27.132 --> 46:33.834
Your mother fought for her life
with every part of her being.

46:33.878 --> 46:35.488
She wouldn't want to see
you throw away yours.

46:38.360 --> 46:41.102
You wear the mask that
gets you through the war,

46:41.146 --> 46:41.973
that helps you survive.

46:44.627 --> 46:47.369
Why did you fight for
Germany if you don't love it?

46:47.413 --> 46:48.588
If you weren't prepared to die.

46:48.631 --> 46:50.851
Don't judge me, Lutz.

46:50.895 --> 46:52.157
You are just as I was.

46:52.200 --> 46:54.768
I would have died for
Germany 10 times over.

46:54.812 --> 46:57.858

[ANGRILY] No, I don't.

47:09.565 --> 47:11.829
You want me to feel as you
feel, but you don't want

47:11.872 --> 47:13.656
me to fight like you fought.

47:13.700 --> 47:15.267
You want me to have
an independent mind,

47:15.310 --> 47:16.616
but not if it goes
against yours.

47:19.662 --> 47:21.360
Who should I be?

47:21.403 --> 47:22.883
Should I be you or not?

47:26.931 --> 47:29.324
You are not a hero.

49:53.468 --> 49:56.428
You must miss her terribly.

49:56.471 --> 50:02.434
My father, he
used to cry a lot.

50:02.477 --> 50:03.304
That was the worst.

50:07.743 --> 50:09.136
I only have one
photograph of my father.

50:14.054 --> 50:15.229
I want to show you something.

53:10.796 --> 53:13.451
Where do they "clear" them to?

53:13.494 --> 53:15.453
LUTZ: Poland, I think.

53:15.496 --> 53:18.195
Camps for labor.

53:18.238 --> 53:19.805
Better they work for Germany
than sitting here plotting

53:19.848 --> 53:21.110
and planning against us.

53:25.854 --> 53:26.681
It's hard, you know.

53:30.729 --> 53:33.035
The Gestapo come looking
for a Jew and they find me.

53:37.431 --> 53:40.260
Not for long.

53:40.304 --> 53:42.871
It can't stay like this forever.

53:42.915 --> 53:43.698
Germany will be calm again.

53:52.359 --> 53:53.969
It will be all right.

54:56.467 --> 54:59.731
[heavy breathing]

55:17.575 --> 55:21.318
LEYNA: What do you
think America is like?

55:21.361 --> 55:24.277
Why?

55:24.321 --> 55:28.542
That woman you showed
me on the magazine--

55:28.586 --> 55:30.979
she's American.

55:31.023 --> 55:31.632
So?

55:36.985 --> 55:41.338
Do you think she's happy?

55:41.381 --> 55:45.167
They hang people like
you in America, Leyna.

55:45.211 --> 55:49.302
They show us in
books at meetings.

55:49.346 --> 55:52.000
People hanging in
trees, set on fire.

56:05.666 --> 56:07.320
Did you ever do that before?

56:10.628 --> 56:11.280
Do what?

56:16.634 --> 56:19.550
What we just did.

56:19.593 --> 56:20.246
Of course.

56:23.249 --> 56:23.902
When?

56:26.948 --> 56:28.080
When was the first time?

56:30.909 --> 56:32.824
I don't know.

56:32.867 --> 56:36.741
A few years ago.

56:36.784 --> 56:37.655
A few years?

56:40.701 --> 56:42.181
Be quiet, Leyna.

56:46.490 --> 56:50.450
I don't think that you
ever touched anyone the way

56:50.494 --> 56:51.625
that you just touched me.

56:56.935 --> 56:58.327
LUTZ: Here, put this on.

57:02.506 --> 57:03.681
What time is it?

57:03.724 --> 57:06.205
It's after 9:00.

57:06.248 --> 57:08.163
What?

57:08.207 --> 57:08.816
Lutz, the curfew.

57:18.957 --> 57:19.784
SS OFFICER: [speaking german]

57:38.063 --> 57:39.020
[vehicle accelerating]

57:39.064 --> 57:42.589
[gasp]

57:42.633 --> 57:44.199
[metal bins rattling]

57:44.243 --> 57:44.852
SS OFFICER: Halt!

57:52.599 --> 57:53.861
Heil Hitler.

57:53.905 --> 57:56.211
SS OFFICER: What are you doing?

57:56.255 --> 57:58.518
I'm-- I'm collecting
some books from Treptow.

57:58.562 --> 58:00.433
I'm preparing for
a meeting tomorrow.

58:00.477 --> 58:01.869
SS OFFICER: And you
couldn't do it in daylight?

58:01.913 --> 58:03.523
Just skulking
around in the dark?

58:03.567 --> 58:05.003
LUTZ: I just returned
from training exercise.

58:05.046 --> 58:06.526
Where do you live?

58:06.570 --> 58:08.267
Hey!

58:08.310 --> 58:09.703
Koppenick.

58:09.747 --> 58:11.966
I live in Koppenick.

58:12.010 --> 58:12.619
Weissmuller's boy?

58:16.449 --> 58:20.801
Go on, get on your way,
before you get arrested.

58:20.845 --> 58:24.022
[engine turns over]

58:28.069 --> 58:29.593
[SOFTLY] Leyna!

58:29.636 --> 58:30.289
Leyna!

58:34.598 --> 58:36.600
I'll wait until you get inside.

58:36.643 --> 58:39.559
Lutz.

58:39.603 --> 58:40.342
What we did today--

58:44.172 --> 58:45.347
did you ever do that before?

58:48.481 --> 58:50.744
No.

58:50.788 --> 58:54.313
[chuckle]

59:04.366 --> 59:07.587
[metal hitting pavement]

59:32.220 --> 59:35.441
[children laughing in distance]

59:49.803 --> 59:51.631
From here on,
you will not leave

59:51.675 --> 59:53.154
the house unless I'm with you.

59:53.198 --> 59:56.201
You've shown you
can't be trusted.

59:56.244 --> 59:58.595
You could have been arrested.

59:58.638 --> 59:59.944
I'm not Jewish.

59:59.987 --> 01:00:01.206
No.

01:00:01.249 --> 01:00:04.078
And nor are you Aryan, Leyna.

01:00:04.122 --> 01:00:06.951
We'll all have to pay for
your mistakes in the end.

01:00:06.994 --> 01:00:09.910
Me, you, even Koen.

01:00:12.696 --> 01:00:14.088
We'll all have to pay.

01:00:19.485 --> 01:00:20.878
You speak of
nothing but mistakes,

01:00:20.921 --> 01:00:23.663
but who's paying for yours?

01:00:23.707 --> 01:00:26.710
[gasp]

01:00:30.844 --> 01:00:34.587
And that's why I will not
watch you throw your life away.

01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:36.415
You will not go
near that boy again.

01:00:53.258 --> 01:00:53.954
[grunt]

01:00:53.998 --> 01:00:56.043
I apologize.

01:00:56.087 --> 01:00:56.696
Excuse me.

01:01:04.225 --> 01:01:05.749
SS OFFICER 1: You!

01:01:05.792 --> 01:01:08.229
Stop.

01:01:08.273 --> 01:01:09.187
Halt!

01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:09.927
Now!

01:01:09.970 --> 01:01:12.494
Stop, Leyna.

01:01:12.538 --> 01:01:13.278
We have to stop.

01:01:17.935 --> 01:01:18.805
Stay here.

01:01:22.504 --> 01:01:24.637
SS OFFICER 1: Both of you!

01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:27.161
Mother, I have no
sterilization papers.

01:01:27.205 --> 01:01:28.380
No identity papers.

01:01:28.423 --> 01:01:29.033
I will explain.

01:01:42.133 --> 01:01:44.831
Your bastard?

01:01:44.875 --> 01:01:45.527
My daughter.

01:01:48.443 --> 01:01:51.142
Your Negro bastard.

01:01:54.014 --> 01:01:56.756
You're at the factory?

01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:58.758
Papers?

01:01:58.802 --> 01:01:59.759
Yes.

01:01:59.803 --> 01:02:00.847
Quickly.

01:02:00.891 --> 01:02:01.543
Yes.

01:02:06.592 --> 01:02:07.549
KERSTIN: Here.

01:02:07.593 --> 01:02:09.160
SS OFFICER 2: Her papers?

01:02:09.203 --> 01:02:10.117
Yes.

01:02:10.161 --> 01:02:12.032
SS OFFICER 1: Tell me--

01:02:12.076 --> 01:02:17.211
What was in your heart when
you were shaming Germany?

01:02:17.255 --> 01:02:18.735
I have never shamed Germany.

01:02:22.173 --> 01:02:23.870
SS OFFICER 2: Her papers!

01:02:23.914 --> 01:02:27.831
SS OFFICER 1: You are
Germany's disgrace.

01:02:27.874 --> 01:02:30.007
You and your bastard.

01:02:30.050 --> 01:02:31.399
[sobbing]

01:02:31.443 --> 01:02:33.532
SS OFFICER 2: Close your mouth.

01:02:33.575 --> 01:02:37.841
Black man's whore.

01:02:37.884 --> 01:02:39.146
You're lost.

01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:45.326
Forgotten what it is to
be a good German woman.

01:02:45.370 --> 01:02:49.113
Do you think you are lost?

01:02:49.156 --> 01:02:52.812
I am not lost.

01:02:52.856 --> 01:02:57.251
Perhaps not forever.

01:02:57.295 --> 01:03:02.430
So then, how do you become
a good German woman?

01:03:05.477 --> 01:03:09.829
You lose your monkey.

01:03:09.873 --> 01:03:10.830
Mama.

01:03:10.874 --> 01:03:14.573
[inaudible]

01:03:14.616 --> 01:03:15.835
What?

01:03:15.879 --> 01:03:17.837
SS OFFICER 1: We take
her or we take you.

01:03:17.881 --> 01:03:20.187
[sobbing]

01:03:20.231 --> 01:03:21.710
No, no, no!
LEYNA: Mama!

01:03:21.754 --> 01:03:23.016
Please!
Please!

01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:23.887
Please, I beg you!

01:03:23.930 --> 01:03:24.888
No, please!

01:03:24.931 --> 01:03:25.671
Please!

01:03:25.714 --> 01:03:26.977
Please, take me!

01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:27.978
Be quiet!

01:03:28.021 --> 01:03:31.285
Take me!

01:03:31.329 --> 01:03:32.460
[screams]

01:03:32.504 --> 01:03:33.200
No!

01:03:33.244 --> 01:03:33.940
Mama!

01:03:33.984 --> 01:03:34.941
KERSTIN: No!

01:03:34.985 --> 01:03:36.987
You don't cry.

01:03:37.030 --> 01:03:38.640
You do not cry.

01:03:47.301 --> 01:03:50.522
[sobbing]

01:03:53.917 --> 01:03:56.180
Mama.

01:03:56.223 --> 01:03:57.181
[truck driving away]

01:03:57.224 --> 01:03:57.834
Mama!

01:04:02.447 --> 01:04:03.056
Mama!

01:04:11.369 --> 01:04:14.067
KOEN: Why didn't she tell me?

01:04:14.111 --> 01:04:17.418
She didn't even say goodbye.

01:04:17.462 --> 01:04:21.161
She told me to
say goodbye for her.

01:04:21.205 --> 01:04:26.210
This work, it will pay her good
money and it won't be for long.

01:04:26.253 --> 01:04:27.776
How long?

01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:28.429
I don't know.

01:04:35.132 --> 01:04:39.049
But she loves us.

01:04:39.092 --> 01:04:44.184
And you can't be away from
people you love for very long.

01:04:44.228 --> 01:04:52.192
So I know, right now,
right this minute,

01:04:52.236 --> 01:04:57.937
she's working as hard as
she can to get back to us.

01:04:57.981 --> 01:05:01.027
I could have gone with her.

01:05:01.071 --> 01:05:02.333
No, you couldn't.

01:05:12.691 --> 01:05:13.431
Excuse me, Herr?

01:05:22.701 --> 01:05:24.790
Herr Engel.

01:05:24.833 --> 01:05:27.575
I was going to visit
Lutz and his father.

01:05:30.491 --> 01:05:32.319
I wasn't sure if he
was still in Munich.

01:05:32.363 --> 01:05:33.538
He's back.

01:05:33.581 --> 01:05:35.105
Oh.

01:05:35.148 --> 01:05:37.368
Lutz you missed already.

01:05:37.411 --> 01:05:39.283
He was summoned to duty.

01:05:39.326 --> 01:05:42.286
One day ago.

01:05:42.329 --> 01:05:43.896
Duty?

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:46.681
Thought he had one month
but they came for him

01:05:46.725 --> 01:05:48.248
early yesterday morning.

01:05:48.292 --> 01:05:50.424
Sent him to the east.

01:05:50.468 --> 01:05:52.122
No warning.

01:05:52.165 --> 01:05:54.994
It was his time.

01:05:55.038 --> 01:05:58.737
Wish it was mine again.

01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:01.914
Nothing in Berlin except
women and old men.

01:06:01.958 --> 01:06:03.089
Huh.

01:06:03.133 --> 01:06:06.701
And hiding Jews.

01:06:06.745 --> 01:06:09.661
[vomiting]

01:06:26.243 --> 01:06:28.071
Is it true you can't
be away from people

01:06:28.114 --> 01:06:32.075
you love for very long?

01:06:32.118 --> 01:06:32.989
Of course it is.

01:06:54.314 --> 01:06:57.796
[knocking on door]

01:07:03.106 --> 01:07:03.758
Koen?

01:07:10.113 --> 01:07:10.722
Come.

01:07:21.385 --> 01:07:22.299
SS OFFICER: Papers.

01:07:22.342 --> 01:07:23.300
Identity papers.

[WHISPERING] What's happening?

01:07:24.997 --> 01:07:26.912
I think they're moving
us to the engine factory.

01:07:26.955 --> 01:07:27.652
SS OFFICER: Papers.

01:07:27.695 --> 01:07:30.655

01:07:35.094 --> 01:07:35.877
What's happening?

01:07:35.921 --> 01:07:37.314
Who are they looking for?

01:07:37.357 --> 01:07:38.097
Take her away.

WOMAN: They're checking
everyone's papers.

01:08:10.216 --> 01:08:11.435
Look, look!

01:08:11.478 --> 01:08:12.697
A woman is running away!

01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:13.872
SS OFFICER 1: Get her!

01:08:13.915 --> 01:08:16.004
SS OFFICER 2: What
are you doing?

01:08:16.048 --> 01:08:17.310
What are you doing?

01:08:17.354 --> 01:08:20.792

01:09:00.919 --> 01:09:01.746
Hurry up.

01:09:11.886 --> 01:09:12.670
Come here.

01:09:22.636 --> 01:09:24.508
You're a mischling?

01:09:24.551 --> 01:09:26.423
Yes.

01:09:26.466 --> 01:09:27.946
My mother is Aryan.

01:09:27.988 --> 01:09:29.033
Sterilized?

01:09:29.077 --> 01:09:30.252
Yes.

01:09:30.296 --> 01:09:31.384
I was sterilized in Rudesheim--

01:09:31.428 --> 01:09:33.691
The Rhineland.

01:09:33.734 --> 01:09:35.867
Your mother did you no favors.

01:09:35.910 --> 01:09:39.305
She rendered you a Neger.

01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:42.569
Don't cling to her
purity because she

01:09:42.613 --> 01:09:43.787
didn't care to make you pure.

01:09:52.274 --> 01:09:52.884

01:09:59.891 --> 01:10:01.284
No.

01:10:01.327 --> 01:10:01.980
I love Germany.

01:10:10.162 --> 01:10:12.382
But they took my
mother and my papers.

01:10:16.212 --> 01:10:20.303
They say there is no such thing
as a Negro of the Fatherland.

01:10:20.346 --> 01:10:21.217
And what do you say?

01:10:24.263 --> 01:10:24.872
I say--

01:10:29.312 --> 01:10:30.182
I say I am German.

01:10:35.927 --> 01:10:39.147
[chatter]

01:10:45.458 --> 01:10:46.111
Stand here.

01:11:14.357 --> 01:11:17.534
[door closes]

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:22.669
SS OSTERHAGEN: I am
going to do for you

01:11:22.713 --> 01:11:24.323
what your mother couldn't.

01:11:24.367 --> 01:11:26.586
I am going to give
you a chance for life,

01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:29.241
because it was not you who
defiled the German race.

01:11:29.285 --> 01:11:32.723
You are merely the
sickening produce.

01:11:32.766 --> 01:11:35.247
You will work in the kitchen.

01:11:35.291 --> 01:11:37.771
You will eat the food you
are given and no more.

01:11:37.815 --> 01:11:42.167
If you take advantage, you
will die before your time,

01:11:42.210 --> 01:11:43.386
as your mother should have.

01:12:09.629 --> 01:12:13.067
[coughing]

01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:15.853
You are in my bunk.

01:12:15.896 --> 01:12:18.203
Oh, hush, Negro.

01:12:18.246 --> 01:12:20.118
[ANGRILY] You think
you are better than me?

01:12:20.161 --> 01:12:21.685
Spare your energy.

01:12:21.728 --> 01:12:23.600
You are only lucky you are
not in the rat house over there

01:12:23.643 --> 01:12:24.296
like--

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:25.428
You think I am Jewish?

01:12:25.471 --> 01:12:27.647
All I want is to
sleep near my sister.

01:12:27.691 --> 01:12:30.868
But an African savage like
you wouldn't understand.

01:12:30.911 --> 01:12:33.436
You would eat your own
mother to keep alive.

01:12:33.479 --> 01:12:36.264
Only a fool sleeps down
there where they piss and empty

01:12:36.308 --> 01:12:38.441
themselves on you from above.

01:12:38.484 --> 01:12:39.920
Well you can sleep in my bunk.

01:12:46.405 --> 01:12:47.928
LEYNA: Where are the
girls that sleep here?

01:12:47.972 --> 01:12:51.062
HERMINE: Infirmary.

01:12:51.105 --> 01:12:51.932
They won't be back.

01:12:57.547 --> 01:13:00.027
Those shoes will
cause you trouble.

01:13:00.071 --> 01:13:01.028
I know but they are strong.

01:13:04.815 --> 01:13:06.033
Down there is ripe for typhus.

01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:11.038
I'm tired of being pushed out.

01:13:18.524 --> 01:13:21.135
[SOFTLY] Your
stomach is round.

01:13:21.179 --> 01:13:22.441
I've seen it in
the wash barracks.

01:13:32.364 --> 01:13:34.192
Do you know what
happens in there?

01:13:37.413 --> 01:13:38.631
Where?

01:13:38.675 --> 01:13:39.980
The Jewish rat house.

01:13:52.123 --> 01:13:53.951
I can't breathe with this air.

01:13:57.084 --> 01:14:00.305
[chatter]

01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:26.244
[wind gusting]

01:15:12.508 --> 01:15:15.685
[leaves rattling]

01:15:28.045 --> 01:15:32.397
LUTZ: [SINGING] How
can I prove how I yearn

01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:37.402
just by the turn of a phrase?

01:15:37.445 --> 01:15:44.278
Can I keep control when
all my soul is aflame?

01:15:48.021 --> 01:15:53.940
But if I'm to say how
madly I adore you,

01:15:53.984 --> 01:15:55.594
let's call a heart a heart.

01:16:11.654 --> 01:16:15.179
[groan]

01:16:24.623 --> 01:16:25.363
Here, take mine.

01:16:29.759 --> 01:16:31.935
Take it.

01:16:31.978 --> 01:16:33.197
I ate in the kitchen.

01:16:46.602 --> 01:16:47.472
Your feet are rotting, Hermine.

01:16:56.002 --> 01:17:00.093
When I can, I'll
bring you a potato.

01:17:00.137 --> 01:17:02.661
You can use it to buy shoes.

01:17:02.705 --> 01:17:03.314
OK?

01:17:07.448 --> 01:17:12.497
HERMINE: Last night,
I ate ice cream.

01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:18.416
Sweet vanilla ice cream.

01:17:18.459 --> 01:17:22.028
I was asleep in
my mother's arms.

01:17:22.072 --> 01:17:25.075
I smelt her skin.

01:17:25.118 --> 01:17:29.470
I felt her heart beat.

01:17:29.514 --> 01:17:31.777
They took her instead of me.

01:17:31.821 --> 01:17:33.692
I will never forgive myself.

01:17:33.736 --> 01:17:37.174
[coughing]

01:17:46.749 --> 01:17:49.012
I have said that
I am sterilized.

01:18:02.634 --> 01:18:05.332
Hermine, it hurts.

01:18:05.376 --> 01:18:06.420
You will get used to it.

01:18:43.806 --> 01:18:44.415
SS GUARD: Halt!

01:18:48.767 --> 01:18:50.334
Where are you coming from
and where are you going?

01:18:53.816 --> 01:18:57.994
Sir, I'm returning from
kitchen duty to my barracks.

01:18:58.037 --> 01:18:59.996
You carry food
from the kitchen.

01:19:00.039 --> 01:19:01.824
Hand it over.

01:19:01.867 --> 01:19:03.086
Sir.

01:19:03.129 --> 01:19:03.782
Take off your clothes.

01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:08.482
Hurry up!

01:19:13.661 --> 01:19:15.098
Come on.

01:19:15.141 --> 01:19:16.229
Do you want to be shot?

01:19:25.108 --> 01:19:26.631
Take off your clothes.

01:19:26.674 --> 01:19:27.458
Now.

01:19:27.501 --> 01:19:28.111
Hey!

01:19:34.987 --> 01:19:36.641
What has she done?

01:19:36.684 --> 01:19:38.121
Negermischling.

01:19:38.164 --> 01:19:40.253
You seen one before?

01:19:40.297 --> 01:19:43.082
Thieving from the kitchen.

01:19:43.126 --> 01:19:45.258
See how she shakes.

01:19:45.302 --> 01:19:46.477
She's hiding food.

01:19:57.053 --> 01:19:59.359
I should like
to deal with her.

01:19:59.403 --> 01:20:08.064
She-- She is miserable.

01:20:08.107 --> 01:20:10.240
Let me take her.

01:20:10.283 --> 01:20:14.853
I want to search her barracks.

01:20:14.897 --> 01:20:17.160
Go ahead.

01:20:17.203 --> 01:20:18.596
If you can stand
the Neger's stench.

01:20:30.738 --> 01:20:31.348
Leyna.

01:20:49.627 --> 01:20:50.236
Wait.

01:20:55.589 --> 01:20:56.199
Stop!

01:21:03.293 --> 01:21:04.555
Where do you sleep?

01:21:07.906 --> 01:21:09.038
We have to walk.

01:21:09.081 --> 01:21:09.777
Where is your block?

01:21:15.479 --> 01:21:19.222
We sleep in the same barracks.

01:21:19.265 --> 01:21:20.440
Can she return with me?

01:21:42.375 --> 01:21:43.420
Do you have food in there?

01:22:20.065 --> 01:22:20.718
Come.

01:22:27.029 --> 01:22:27.725
You look pale.

01:22:27.768 --> 01:22:28.726
Are you sick?

01:22:28.769 --> 01:22:29.945
No.

01:22:29.988 --> 01:22:31.903
HEINZ: You stay away
from the prisoners.

01:22:31.947 --> 01:22:33.644
Camp is riddled,
we can't keep up.

01:22:39.389 --> 01:22:42.435
Why did you bring me here?

01:22:42.479 --> 01:22:44.002
Was it just to be with you?

01:22:44.046 --> 01:22:46.309
Well is that so bad?

01:22:46.352 --> 01:22:49.051
Right now, the Jews are bribing
each other with food just

01:22:49.094 --> 01:22:51.618
to be close to a loved one.

01:22:51.662 --> 01:22:52.837
Whether you fight
or you are here,

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:54.056
you are surrounded by death.

01:22:54.099 --> 01:22:56.493
At least here you're
not being shot at.

01:22:56.536 --> 01:22:58.103
And no one can
doubt your loyalty

01:22:58.147 --> 01:22:58.974
if you wear the uniform.

01:23:03.195 --> 01:23:06.372
"You wear the mask that
will get you through the war

01:23:06.416 --> 01:23:07.417
and allow you to survive."

01:23:15.207 --> 01:23:18.297
[coughing]

01:23:19.429 --> 01:23:21.474
[SOFTLY] It's cooked.

01:23:21.518 --> 01:23:24.216
I will get you good shoes.

01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:26.479
I think I should look after
it for you until tomorrow.

01:23:38.317 --> 01:23:39.797
Have a small bite.

01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:41.364
But just one or you'll
be furious with yourself.

01:23:55.204 --> 01:23:58.685
[sobbing]

01:24:03.125 --> 01:24:05.779
[chatter]

01:25:01.922 --> 01:25:02.923
He needs someone
young and strong.

01:25:02.967 --> 01:25:04.142
Go with him.

01:25:13.412 --> 01:25:14.674
LUTZ: You have to talk to me.

01:25:25.903 --> 01:25:27.122
How did you get here?

01:25:30.821 --> 01:25:33.040
What about your mother?

01:25:33.084 --> 01:25:33.650
Brother?

01:25:36.827 --> 01:25:39.699
What about Lutz?

01:25:39.743 --> 01:25:40.570
What happened to him?

01:25:47.533 --> 01:25:48.752
I was called.

01:25:48.795 --> 01:25:51.929
I had no time.

01:25:51.972 --> 01:25:55.150
I didn't know how
to get word to you.

01:25:55.193 --> 01:25:57.282
I thought they would
send me to fight.

01:26:00.894 --> 01:26:04.202
Instead they sent me to a camp.

01:26:04.246 --> 01:26:05.290
East.

01:26:08.859 --> 01:26:14.430
All day the smell
of skin and bone.

01:26:14.473 --> 01:26:15.692
[SOFTLY] I can't bear it.

01:26:21.915 --> 01:26:23.352
You have worked in
a place like that?

01:26:23.395 --> 01:26:24.048
No.

01:26:27.225 --> 01:26:29.880
But I have seen Jews
selected to work in them.

01:26:36.930 --> 01:26:40.195
In the killing rooms.

01:26:40.238 --> 01:26:41.457
To kill other Jews?

01:26:47.202 --> 01:26:48.812
But there will be none left.

01:26:54.209 --> 01:26:55.819
The smoke never stops.

01:26:59.518 --> 01:27:00.780
No, it doesn't.

01:27:08.745 --> 01:27:11.008
I want to make it stop
but I don't know how.

01:27:15.186 --> 01:27:16.274
Why are you staring at me?

01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:22.759
You look changed.

01:27:30.723 --> 01:27:33.596
The latrines.

01:27:33.639 --> 01:27:36.120
I'll be on duty nearby tonight.

01:27:36.163 --> 01:27:36.860
Meet me.

01:27:36.903 --> 01:27:38.035
I'll bring food.

01:27:38.078 --> 01:27:39.558
No.

01:27:39.602 --> 01:27:42.996
You need to eat, Leyna.

01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:45.216
SS JUTTNER: I haven't
received the order from you.

01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:46.609
Which order?

01:27:46.652 --> 01:27:48.959
Clearing the children.

01:27:49.002 --> 01:27:50.482
In the absence of
the Commandant,

01:27:50.526 --> 01:27:52.963
it needs your signature.

01:27:53.006 --> 01:27:54.791
I've had more urgent concerns.

01:27:54.834 --> 01:27:56.619
In case you haven't
noticed, we're 60

01:27:56.662 --> 01:27:58.403
tanks short of losing the war.

01:27:58.447 --> 01:28:00.753
Yes, and I'm not interested
in leaving diseased corpses

01:28:00.797 --> 01:28:01.537
for the Americans to find.

01:28:01.580 --> 01:28:02.451
Are you?

01:28:09.849 --> 01:28:15.202
Do you know why you were always
the cause of so many rumors?

01:28:15.246 --> 01:28:18.858
Your inability to say
what's going on in your mind

01:28:18.902 --> 01:28:20.947
and your choice of company.

01:28:20.991 --> 01:28:24.995
Dubious, always.

01:28:25.038 --> 01:28:26.605
Your friend,
Bismarck Schonhausen,

01:28:26.649 --> 01:28:28.999
has been arrested in Berlin--

01:28:29.042 --> 01:28:32.742
plotting against the
Fuhrer, with 15 others.

01:28:32.785 --> 01:28:34.744
He should be hanged like a dog.

01:28:34.787 --> 01:28:37.921
So should his son, if
they have any sense.

01:28:37.964 --> 01:28:42.708
Sins of the father and such.

01:28:42.752 --> 01:28:48.105
How many times would you
say he visited your home?

01:28:48.148 --> 01:28:50.325
About as many times
as you, Juttner.

01:29:13.739 --> 01:29:16.351
[gasp]

01:29:16.394 --> 01:29:17.482
You didn't come yesterday.

01:29:24.663 --> 01:29:25.490
I brought you this.

01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:38.851
And some food.

01:29:38.895 --> 01:29:40.940
PETER: Sir, this was
found in the camp,

01:29:40.984 --> 01:29:43.334
amongst jewelry
from the prisoners.

01:29:43.378 --> 01:29:47.033
It is a Weissmuller
ring, isn't it?

01:29:47.077 --> 01:29:47.860
Thank you, Peter.

01:29:47.904 --> 01:29:48.513
You can go.

01:29:54.911 --> 01:29:58.175
[door opens and closes]

01:30:02.484 --> 01:30:05.443
I'm filthy.

01:30:05.487 --> 01:30:06.096
Let me hold you.

01:30:16.411 --> 01:30:19.588
[heavy, labored breathing]

01:30:24.331 --> 01:30:28.161
Why do you breathe like that?

01:30:28.205 --> 01:30:29.075
I'm cold.

01:31:11.422 --> 01:31:12.031
Leyna?

01:31:15.731 --> 01:31:16.383
Yes.

01:31:24.653 --> 01:31:26.263
I last held you
six months ago.

01:31:37.970 --> 01:31:39.842
Leyna, you are afraid of me?

01:31:42.932 --> 01:31:44.803
Did someone hurt you this way?

01:31:51.593 --> 01:31:52.811
Did we do this together?

01:32:06.521 --> 01:32:07.478
[truck driving away]

01:32:07.522 --> 01:32:10.742
[chatter]

01:32:38.770 --> 01:32:42.295
[child crying]

01:32:48.780 --> 01:32:52.262
[footsteps]

01:32:53.393 --> 01:32:54.264
Walk with me.

01:33:23.293 --> 01:33:26.557
[hammering]

01:33:51.756 --> 01:33:54.541
This isn't war.

01:33:54.585 --> 01:33:55.760
Harming ordinary people.

01:33:59.546 --> 01:34:00.547
It isn't what a soldier does.

01:34:00.591 --> 01:34:01.548
Hm.

01:34:01.592 --> 01:34:03.768
You think so?

01:34:03.812 --> 01:34:05.770
That is precisely
what a soldier does,

01:34:05.814 --> 01:34:08.773
whether he wants to or not.

01:34:08.817 --> 01:34:11.907
That is war.

01:34:11.950 --> 01:34:17.042
I told you your choices would
keep you alive or see you dead.

01:34:17.086 --> 01:34:19.131
You came here, so you're alive.

01:34:24.789 --> 01:34:27.966
Those were your options.

01:34:28.010 --> 01:34:30.447
Choose life or choose death.

01:34:42.111 --> 01:34:46.028
LUTZ: You told me
we are not heroes.

01:34:46.071 --> 01:34:47.638
What you should have said
is that we are cowards.

01:35:05.351 --> 01:35:08.615
[scribbling]

01:35:24.893 --> 01:35:25.850
[door opens]

01:35:25.894 --> 01:35:27.243
BLOCKLEADER: Up.

01:35:27.286 --> 01:35:28.635
Up!

01:35:28.679 --> 01:35:29.854
Get up!

01:35:29.898 --> 01:35:30.637
Now!

01:35:30.681 --> 01:35:33.205
Come on!

01:35:33.249 --> 01:35:35.251
HERMINE: Where are my shoes?

01:35:35.294 --> 01:35:36.208
Where are my shoes?

01:35:41.779 --> 01:35:43.868
Did you take my shoes?

01:35:43.912 --> 01:35:44.869
LEYNA: Did you take her shoes?

01:35:44.913 --> 01:35:46.610
Did you take my shoes?

01:35:46.653 --> 01:35:47.698
LEYNA: Did you take her shoes?

01:35:47.742 --> 01:35:49.569
[FRANTICALLY]
Where are my shoes?

01:35:49.613 --> 01:35:50.788
Where are my shoes?
LEYNA: Hermine.

01:35:50.832 --> 01:35:51.702
HERMINE: Where are my shoes?

01:35:51.746 --> 01:35:52.529
Hermine, stop it!

01:35:52.572 --> 01:35:53.443
She's dead!

01:36:00.842 --> 01:36:04.976
Betz, Leyna.

01:36:05.020 --> 01:36:09.764
Do you know what
he will do to me?

01:36:09.807 --> 01:36:11.766
He's a murdering pig.

01:36:15.508 --> 01:36:19.338
I saw my family go to the
place you call the rat house.

01:36:22.515 --> 01:36:25.214
Where, one by one
they disappeared.

01:36:29.958 --> 01:36:37.182
My mother, she told me
never admit you are a Jew.

01:36:40.055 --> 01:36:43.275
That is how to stay alive.

01:36:43.319 --> 01:36:46.191
[sobbing]

01:36:46.235 --> 01:36:50.717
I'm alive, Leyna.

01:36:50.761 --> 01:36:54.591
I missed the smoke and
came here for labor.

01:36:54.634 --> 01:36:55.853
Hermine.

01:36:55.897 --> 01:37:03.252
And now, I will die
because I have no shoes.

01:37:03.295 --> 01:37:04.557
You will not die.

01:37:11.173 --> 01:37:14.437
[coughing]

01:37:44.554 --> 01:37:45.163
Shoeless?

01:37:48.079 --> 01:37:50.429
Why?

01:37:50.473 --> 01:37:53.041
Sir, my shoes were taken in
the barracks during the night.

01:37:56.131 --> 01:37:58.046
Weissmuller.

01:37:58.089 --> 01:37:58.916
Join me, will you?

01:38:12.974 --> 01:38:13.583
Shoot her.

01:38:23.636 --> 01:38:24.507
Shoot her.

01:38:34.169 --> 01:38:34.909
[gunshot]

01:38:34.952 --> 01:38:38.390

01:38:54.406 --> 01:38:57.322
[thud]

01:38:57.366 --> 01:38:58.454
Do you laugh?

01:38:58.497 --> 01:39:01.544
You find her insolence amusing?

01:39:01.587 --> 01:39:02.414
Do you?

01:39:02.458 --> 01:39:04.329
Eh?

01:39:04.373 --> 01:39:07.637
[woman sobbing]

01:39:48.808 --> 01:39:50.636
LEYNA: You should
have killed her.

01:39:55.467 --> 01:39:56.555
Then I might
understand who you are.

01:40:01.256 --> 01:40:02.126
She had no weapon.

01:40:05.173 --> 01:40:06.783
That's not how I
wanted to fight.

01:40:11.092 --> 01:40:12.310
She was a Jewess.

01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:17.098
She told me.

01:40:17.141 --> 01:40:20.884
[sobbing]

01:40:20.927 --> 01:40:23.930
Germany told us the
world is against us,

01:40:23.974 --> 01:40:29.023
and yet all I see is Germany
killing its own people.

01:40:32.243 --> 01:40:35.420
Leyna, we need to
go somewhere where

01:40:35.464 --> 01:40:37.031
nobody would ever know us.

01:40:37.074 --> 01:40:38.902
Away from Germany, away from--

01:40:38.945 --> 01:40:44.647
Lutz, when you look
at me, what do you see?

01:40:50.218 --> 01:40:53.047
I am not a gypsy.

01:40:53.090 --> 01:40:54.048
I'm not a Jew.

01:40:57.268 --> 01:41:01.490
Even in this camp they tell
me I have no place to belong.

01:41:01.533 --> 01:41:05.972
I see a German girl, loyal
and dutiful to the Fatherland.

01:41:06.016 --> 01:41:09.324
But I was never
allowed to love it.

01:41:09.367 --> 01:41:12.327
You are not supposed to love me.

01:41:12.370 --> 01:41:13.023
But I do.

01:41:21.162 --> 01:41:28.256
Hermine died, forced
to deny who she was.

01:41:28.299 --> 01:41:31.476
And now I must live
for both of us,

01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:35.915
declaring every day who I am.

01:41:35.959 --> 01:41:39.484
Here, in my country.

01:41:39.528 --> 01:41:43.184
They will kill
you and our child.

01:41:43.227 --> 01:41:44.968
If the baby has
survived all of this,

01:41:45.011 --> 01:41:49.451
then so can I. They didn't
want me to have a child.

01:41:54.020 --> 01:41:59.156
But she and I will be
the evidence of all

01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:04.901
that she and I are and all
that they try to deny--

01:42:04.944 --> 01:42:07.817
that I am a German Negro.

01:42:10.863 --> 01:42:13.083
Love me where we
both belong, Lutz.

01:42:16.695 --> 01:42:18.262
[sobbing]

01:42:18.306 --> 01:42:20.090
We have to at least
get out of here.

01:42:20.134 --> 01:42:23.789
Hide somewhere until
the war is over.

01:42:23.833 --> 01:42:25.748
I can steak a car
or bike, anything.

01:42:25.791 --> 01:42:26.879
We-- we can't stay in this.

01:42:26.923 --> 01:42:29.360
Please.

01:42:29.404 --> 01:42:33.451
We will never make it out
alive if we try to escape.

01:42:33.495 --> 01:42:34.844
You can't save me.

01:42:38.064 --> 01:42:41.503
Can you save me?

01:42:41.546 --> 01:42:46.203
I want you to breathe properly,
and to eat morning and night

01:42:46.247 --> 01:42:49.728
without the fear that you
will be murdered in this place

01:42:49.772 --> 01:42:52.818
that-- that tells me that
I should be a murderer.

01:42:57.388 --> 01:43:00.086
I don't want you to
be afraid anymore.

01:43:00.130 --> 01:43:03.351
[door opens]

01:43:10.488 --> 01:43:14.449
[sigh]

01:43:14.492 --> 01:43:17.539
It will be over soon.

01:43:17.582 --> 01:43:21.195
For all of us it will be over.

01:43:21.238 --> 01:43:24.241
Once the prisoners are moved,
I'll make arrangements for you

01:43:24.285 --> 01:43:25.068
to go back to Berlin.

01:43:25.111 --> 01:43:27.026
Moved?

01:43:27.070 --> 01:43:28.463
How?

01:43:28.506 --> 01:43:30.378
The railway lines are
bombed, the roads destroyed

01:43:30.421 --> 01:43:31.727
and dangerous.

01:43:31.770 --> 01:43:32.989
They'll walk.

01:43:33.032 --> 01:43:34.599
We'll move them.

01:43:34.643 --> 01:43:35.339
Little by little.

01:43:35.383 --> 01:43:37.298
They'll die.

01:43:37.341 --> 01:43:39.082
Most of them can barely make
it to relieve themselves.

01:43:51.660 --> 01:43:56.230
Or perhaps you want to go now?

01:43:56.273 --> 01:43:58.580
No.

01:43:58.623 --> 01:44:00.843
I'm not going, not yet.

01:44:00.886 --> 01:44:03.759
They're coming at
us from both sides.

01:44:03.802 --> 01:44:06.457
I don't know who will reach here
first but I can't protect you.

01:44:06.501 --> 01:44:08.242
I don't want
you to protect me.

01:44:08.285 --> 01:44:10.287
And this?

01:44:10.331 --> 01:44:14.726
You want me to put it back
in the prisoners' barracks?

01:44:14.770 --> 01:44:15.814
Don't make me choose for you.

01:45:03.340 --> 01:45:04.907
You will have to
do this quickly.

01:45:04.950 --> 01:45:06.735
They will start moving
the camp in days.

01:45:06.778 --> 01:45:08.911
I have a uniform for you.

01:45:08.954 --> 01:45:11.043
I can't walk
through the gates.

01:45:11.087 --> 01:45:11.870
I can't!

01:45:11.914 --> 01:45:13.568
We will use a motorcycle.

01:45:13.611 --> 01:45:14.743
I will get one.

01:45:14.786 --> 01:45:15.483
I promise

01:45:15.526 --> 01:45:17.789
Lutz, we will die.

01:45:17.833 --> 01:45:20.139
Leyna, we will have a life.

01:45:20.183 --> 01:45:22.751
A life.

What's happening, Kapo?

01:46:48.010 --> 01:46:49.533
I don't know.

01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:53.319
Hurry up!

The women's camp,
what's happening?

01:46:55.931 --> 01:46:56.540
You're moving them already.

01:46:56.584 --> 01:46:57.889
We have to.

01:46:57.933 --> 01:47:00.326
You and me leave today.

01:47:00.370 --> 01:47:01.719
And when were you
going to tell me?

01:47:01.763 --> 01:47:02.590
I'm telling you now.

01:47:05.201 --> 01:47:05.897

01:47:05.941 --> 01:47:06.811
I won't go!

01:47:16.125 --> 01:47:19.128
Then it will be you,
the thieves, and the Jews.

01:47:19.171 --> 01:47:20.085
How do you rate your chances?

01:47:23.001 --> 01:47:24.612
Do you know yourself, Lutz?

01:47:24.655 --> 01:47:25.656
Do you?

01:47:25.700 --> 01:47:27.702
Yes, I know myself.

01:47:27.745 --> 01:47:29.007
And you!

01:47:29.051 --> 01:47:31.793
You know what she means to me.

01:47:31.836 --> 01:47:35.361
And if you take her
away, you will kill me.

01:47:35.405 --> 01:47:38.364
And you think planning
a future with a Negro

01:47:38.408 --> 01:47:39.975
will keep you alive?

01:47:40.018 --> 01:47:43.108
I refuse to let you be arrested
and tortured because of her.

01:47:43.152 --> 01:47:45.023
Germany will not
let you survive.

01:47:45.067 --> 01:47:46.634
You will not survive!

01:47:46.677 --> 01:47:50.725

having our child.

01:47:50.768 --> 01:47:52.857
We have to survive!

01:47:52.901 --> 01:47:53.510
We have to.

01:47:56.731 --> 01:47:58.733
They will hang you.
