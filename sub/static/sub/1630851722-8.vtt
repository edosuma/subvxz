-Check that out.

KEOGHAN:
Today, you are going to set up

00:07.240 --> 00:09.342

<i>Mike turned his way to the top.</i>

00:28.061 --> 00:30.764
-And Mike gets the job done!

00:41.241 --> 00:42.375
KELSY:
Oh!

00:42.442 --> 00:43.943
You just need to make
some adjustments.

00:44.010 --> 00:45.879
<i>...forcing him to punch out.</i>

-KELSY: Back up!

KEOGHAN:
Got to move this material,

it's drying fast.

Our teamwork and communication
was great on the last challenge.

02:31.284 --> 02:34.721
Things to improve would
definitely be staying calm.

02:34.787 --> 02:36.723
Yeah.

-Why? What happened?
-KALIMBA: Go team.

02:39.392 --> 02:40.894
I'm just really pumped today.

02:40.960 --> 02:42.095
(laughs):
She just...

02:42.161 --> 02:43.663
I want it so bad.

02:43.730 --> 02:45.999
I feel pressure. I don't want it
to go to four and four.

02:46.065 --> 02:48.401
Oh, my gosh, I do not want that.

02:48.468 --> 02:50.837
No, we're gonna see
the lioness come out today.

02:50.904 --> 02:52.238
-KALIMBA: Yeah.
-LIA: Okay.

02:52.305 --> 02:55.241
Initially coming here,
I wasn't sure what to expect

02:55.308 --> 02:58.011
<i>from the people I'd be placed</i>
<i>on a team with.</i>

02:58.077 --> 02:59.879
But for Dirty Hands
to just welcome me

02:59.946 --> 03:02.115
with open arms for who I am,

03:02.181 --> 03:03.983
<i>that means the world;</i>
<i>I never had that.</i>

03:04.050 --> 03:06.953
<i>So win or lose, I'm walking away</i>

03:07.020 --> 03:08.488
with some new family members.

03:08.555 --> 03:10.957
Out of this whole thing,
the fact that, like,

03:11.024 --> 03:14.127
I met these awesome people,
all of you guys,

03:14.193 --> 03:16.129
and you guys
just love me regardless,

03:16.195 --> 03:19.399
that means more than money,
you know?

03:19.465 --> 03:22.468
When I was younger, um,
I was always just friends

03:22.535 --> 03:24.370
-with my sister's friends.
-JEROME: Yeah, yeah...

03:24.437 --> 03:26.372
You know, I never really,
truly had my own,

03:26.439 --> 03:29.042
and I always kind of
felt like, you know,

03:29.108 --> 03:30.677
like, a loner, I guess.

03:30.743 --> 03:32.478
Think you found your tribe.

03:32.545 --> 03:34.314
-Yeah.
-Your people.

03:34.380 --> 03:35.982
LIA:
I wish everybody could find
their tribe.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.417
I-I don't want
to bring you down,

03:37.483 --> 03:40.620
but I wish my nephew Nigel
could have met you guys.

03:42.322 --> 03:44.857
<i>My nephew Nigel</i>
<i>was 14 years old.</i>

03:44.924 --> 03:47.260
<i>He was a geeky, lovable,</i>

03:47.327 --> 03:48.328
kind, compassionate kid.

03:48.394 --> 03:50.897
He would do anything for anyone.

03:50.964 --> 03:54.567
And what we didn't know was
he was being bullied at school.

03:54.634 --> 03:57.103
I mean, brutally picked on.

03:57.170 --> 04:00.506
And, uh, one day, a couple
weeks after Thanksgiving,

04:00.573 --> 04:02.875
he took his own life...

04:02.942 --> 04:04.143
-QUINCEY: Oh, no.
-...one evening.

04:04.210 --> 04:07.847
So, Christine saying
she didn't have any friends

04:07.914 --> 04:12.485
kind of hit on me, 'cause
he'd be her age right now.

04:12.552 --> 04:14.520
There's no room for bullying
in anybody's life.

04:14.587 --> 04:15.722
No.

04:15.788 --> 04:17.190
One of the cool things
about our team

04:17.256 --> 04:20.827
is we haven't just shared ups,
you know, and positive things,

04:20.893 --> 04:22.195
we've shared some of our--

04:22.262 --> 04:24.530
the darkest times in our lives
with each other.

04:24.597 --> 04:26.866
-Yeah.
-And we've been able
to support each other.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.067
CHRISTINE:
Today is for all

04:28.134 --> 04:30.169
of the kids that get bullied...

04:30.236 --> 04:31.671
-Yes.
-...and made fun of

04:31.738 --> 04:33.239
-and think
they're not good enough.
-Yes.

04:33.306 --> 04:34.807
-Feel like they don't fit in.
-CHRISTINE: Yeah.

04:34.874 --> 04:36.809
KALIMBA:
Yeah. We're gonna do this
for Nigel.

04:36.876 --> 04:38.211
-QUINCEY: For Nigel.
-LIA: Thank you.

04:38.277 --> 04:39.812
CHRISTINE:
And all the kids like him.

04:39.879 --> 04:41.514
And all the kids
in his situation.

04:41.581 --> 04:43.249
LIA:
I love you all,
and I hope someday

04:43.316 --> 04:45.885
everyone has a team like you.

04:45.952 --> 04:48.655
-Friends, family, tribe.
-KALIMBA: Yeah.

04:51.224 --> 04:52.892
-KEOGHAN: Morning, everyone.
-CONTESTANTS: Morning!

04:52.959 --> 04:54.894
-Morning, Phil.
-Team score stands at...

04:54.961 --> 04:56.663
CONTESTANTS:
4-3.

04:56.729 --> 04:58.998
Dirty Hands,
if you get this job done first,

04:59.065 --> 05:01.467
you will get
your fifth Badge of Honor

05:01.534 --> 05:05.371
and be the overall
team competition winners.

05:05.438 --> 05:07.540
Savage Crew, you want
to tie things up today.

05:07.607 --> 05:09.809
You want to force
that tiebreaker,

05:09.876 --> 05:13.813
and also win $12,000 cash

05:13.880 --> 05:15.448
for today's prize,

05:15.515 --> 05:20.019
and, let's not forget,
today's Badge of Honor.

05:20.086 --> 05:23.656
Dirty Hands, you win today,
you not only get the $12,000

05:23.723 --> 05:25.658
for the win,

05:25.725 --> 05:28.194
you will also get
the cash bonus prize

05:28.261 --> 05:31.030
-of $60,000.
-(cheering, applause)

05:31.097 --> 05:33.366
KALIMBA:
Yeah, let's go.

05:33.433 --> 05:36.302
KEOGHAN:
So, Jerry's family has
been working in the business

05:36.369 --> 05:40.173
of resealing tarmac
for 30 years,

05:40.239 --> 05:42.341
and he's been out
working with his dad

05:42.408 --> 05:45.244
since he was 13 years old.

05:45.311 --> 05:47.180
Jerry, thank you for letting us
come out to your jobsite today.

05:47.246 --> 05:49.849
-Thank you.
-Your job today

05:49.916 --> 05:53.986
is to reseal a section
of this car park

05:54.053 --> 05:55.154
for Jerry and his team.

05:55.221 --> 05:58.224
As you can see,
there are two boxed-out areas

05:58.291 --> 05:59.859
that you need to reseal.

05:59.926 --> 06:03.429
Each section is 200 feet long
and 80 feet wide.

06:03.496 --> 06:05.131
There are four parts
to this job:

06:05.198 --> 06:07.934
removing cars using a tow truck,

06:08.000 --> 06:11.003
cleaning the surface
using blowers and brooms,

06:11.070 --> 06:15.208
filling in the cracks marked
with chalk using a melter,

06:15.274 --> 06:18.678
and finally, covering
everything up with sealant.

06:18.745 --> 06:20.546
And you want to use
the squeegees back here,

06:20.613 --> 06:24.450
to spread out the sealant,
get a nice, even finish.

06:24.517 --> 06:27.353
It's completely up to you

06:27.420 --> 06:28.888
how you divide up the work,

06:28.955 --> 06:30.857
but before you start
spreading out sealant,

06:30.923 --> 06:33.826
make sure there's no cars
in the way,

06:33.893 --> 06:36.229
that the surface
you're pouring on has no debris,

06:36.295 --> 06:40.233
and that the cracks are filled
in before you cover them up.

06:40.299 --> 06:43.369
-Nice.
-You also want to get
a thumbs-up from Jerry

06:43.436 --> 06:46.372
as you complete
each quarter section.

06:46.439 --> 06:48.574
First team to reseal
their surface

06:48.641 --> 06:50.209
will win this team challenge.

06:51.878 --> 06:54.347
All right, is everybody ready
to get to work?

06:54.413 --> 06:56.582
-CONTESTANTS: Yeah!
<i>-MIKE: Savage Crew definitely</i>

06:56.649 --> 06:58.818
has to take this win today,
there's no doubt about it.

06:58.885 --> 07:03.956
<i>Ultimately, I feel responsible</i>
<i>because I want everybody to win</i>

07:04.023 --> 07:05.825
<i>that $60,000.</i>

07:05.892 --> 07:07.827
Our backs are against the wall
against Dirty Hands,

07:07.894 --> 07:09.128
and we got to win this.

07:09.195 --> 07:10.763
Let's pick our crew boss.

07:10.830 --> 07:12.598
I feel like, maybe Jerome?

07:12.665 --> 07:14.433
Do you accept this challenge?

07:14.500 --> 07:15.768
I did this, like,
thousands of times.

07:15.835 --> 07:17.036
Okay, it's done.

07:17.103 --> 07:19.138
I already know that Sarah
has experience doing asphalt.

07:19.205 --> 07:22.608
Is seal coat pretty much
still in your comfort zone?

07:22.675 --> 07:24.277
Yeah. The key is,
when we're doing the sealant,

07:24.343 --> 07:25.845
we need all hands on deck.

07:25.912 --> 07:27.880
All right, everybody,
stay hungry, stay humble.

07:27.947 --> 07:30.950
-One, two, three.
-Savage Crew!

07:31.017 --> 07:32.852
The last team challenge,
I took over as crew boss

07:32.919 --> 07:34.520
and we were able to get a win.

07:34.587 --> 07:36.389
<i>So, now we definitely</i>
<i>have that momentum.</i>

07:36.455 --> 07:38.825
<i>If Dirty Hands</i>
<i>would have gotten it,</i>

07:38.891 --> 07:40.459
<i>they would have took</i>
<i>that $60,000,</i>

07:40.526 --> 07:43.996
so that's mainly our focus,
is-is just keep that money

07:44.063 --> 07:45.898
off the table until it comes
down to that, you know,

07:45.965 --> 07:47.133
final challenge.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.968
KEOGHAN:
On the work whistle.

07:51.404 --> 07:53.005
-(work whistle blows)
-Go, go, go!

07:53.072 --> 07:55.141
-Go, go, go.
-Let's go!
-Come on, guys!

07:58.644 --> 08:00.847
<i>QUINCEY:</i>
<i>Never driven a tow truck before,</i>

08:00.913 --> 08:02.949
but I have towed my barbecue
around on the back of my truck,

08:03.015 --> 08:06.786
so, eh, if you call that
experience, I got a lot of that.

08:06.853 --> 08:08.187
Let's do it.

08:08.254 --> 08:09.922
All the way over here, Alfie!

08:09.989 --> 08:11.324
SARAH:
Y'all keep going!

08:11.390 --> 08:13.459
There you go.
Good job, good job.

KEOGHAN:
Lia and Tak working the blowers

08:14.927 --> 08:16.762
for Dirty Hands.

08:16.829 --> 08:18.865
Alfie and Kelsy
are still trying to get

08:18.931 --> 08:21.033
-this section clear.
-Okay.

08:21.100 --> 08:22.668
<i>ELIZABETH:</i>
<i>I feel comfortable</i>
<i>with the tow truck</i>

08:22.735 --> 08:25.972
because I back up a trailer
all the time, hook up a trailer.

08:26.038 --> 08:29.976
<i>And my plan is to have Hanger</i>
<i>hook everything up, line it u.</i>

08:30.042 --> 08:32.645
-I just put in my side...
-HANGER: Go, go.

08:32.712 --> 08:33.846
...and then we'll lift it up
and take off.

08:33.913 --> 08:35.815
HANGER:
There we go. Go, go, go, go, go.

08:35.882 --> 08:37.516

-KEOGHAN: Dirty Hands

08:37.583 --> 08:39.652
already moving
their first car out of the lot.

08:39.719 --> 08:41.954
Quincey and Kalimba are flying.

08:42.021 --> 08:44.557
Savage Crew, yet to get going
with their first car.

08:44.624 --> 08:45.691
You're gonna unhook it
by yourself?

08:45.758 --> 08:47.360
-Yeah.
-Okay.

08:47.426 --> 08:49.962
<i>ELIZABETH:</i>
<i>Hanger and I towed</i>
<i>the first car so fast,</i>

08:50.029 --> 08:51.998
I told Hanger I could do
the second one by myself

08:52.064 --> 08:54.033
just so that we can
conserve resources.

08:54.100 --> 08:57.470
<i>I said, "You stay</i>

09:02.675 --> 09:04.977
You know,
it's a very tedious job

<i>and you have to, you know,</i>

09:08.014 --> 09:09.916
<i>you know, I'm just using</i>
<i>my skills as alignment,</i>

09:09.982 --> 09:12.618
<i>I'm very steady and precise.</i>

09:12.685 --> 09:14.353
KEOGHAN:
Dirty Hands looking for a check.

09:14.420 --> 09:15.821
-Is it clean, Jerry?
-It's clean.

09:15.888 --> 09:17.623
KEOGHAN: It's clean.
Dirty Hands, you are clean.

09:17.690 --> 09:19.525
-You can seal.
-JEROME: Moving truck.

09:19.592 --> 09:20.760
KEOGHAN:
Jerome is moving the truck

09:20.826 --> 09:23.029
to get the sealant
into the jobsite.

09:23.095 --> 09:24.931
Savage Crew yet
to get their section clean.

09:24.997 --> 09:26.832
-Back up!
-Over here, over here!

09:26.899 --> 09:27.967
Dirty Hands already sealing.

09:28.034 --> 09:29.201
Wow, they are flying
over here...

09:29.268 --> 09:31.103
Yeah. I'm-a bring them to you.

09:31.170 --> 09:33.806
KEOGHAN:
...as Christine continues
to fill in the cracks.

09:33.873 --> 09:35.775
ALFIE:
All the way out. Keep going!

09:35.841 --> 09:37.843
KEOGHAN:
Savage Crew,
you can start sealing.

09:37.910 --> 09:39.478
Both teams have
finished clearing

09:39.545 --> 09:40.880
all the debris
off their jobsite.

09:40.947 --> 09:42.882
Elizabeth picks up
the second car

09:42.949 --> 09:44.350

09:45.952 --> 09:47.486
-I'm telling you.
-KALIMBA: Yep. Good job, guys.

what a "ring roll" is.

09:54.894 --> 09:56.729
Catch my ring roll.
We need help here.

09:56.796 --> 09:59.465
I know what he's saying

09:59.532 --> 10:02.802
I've used a squeegee every
Saturday for the last 20 years.

10:02.868 --> 10:06.138
I've had to squeegee the
fire station apparatus floor.

10:06.205 --> 10:07.707

-I'll get your ring roll.
-JEROME: That's right.

10:12.078 --> 10:13.346
Just follow ring roll.

10:13.412 --> 10:15.147
I kept saying, "Ring roll,
catch-catch my ring rolls,"

10:15.214 --> 10:16.749
they're like--
just look at me, "What?"

10:16.816 --> 10:18.017
I said, "Just follow me, then."

10:18.084 --> 10:19.251
Small ring roll,
small ring roll.

10:19.318 --> 10:21.687
No, step o-over everything--

10:21.754 --> 10:23.756
KEOGHAN:
Savage Crew pouring out
the sealant.

10:23.823 --> 10:25.858
You guys got to move
this material,

10:25.925 --> 10:27.893

10:27.960 --> 10:28.828
HANGER:
Take more to the other side.

-Mike, I'm-a take a lot with me.
-Yeah.

10:45.444 --> 10:47.013
-I'll follow right behind you.
-Erase-erase my lines behind me.

10:47.079 --> 10:48.514
Don't worry about me.

10:48.581 --> 10:50.182
We have to start
moving together as a unit,

10:50.249 --> 10:53.452
<i>so that you cover approximately</i>
<i>15, 18 feet at a time</i>

10:53.519 --> 10:54.887

10:54.954 --> 10:56.689
So, nobody step on what we got.
Let's go.

10:56.756 --> 10:58.024
-Yes, sir.
-Don't step on it, we can't--

10:58.090 --> 10:59.859
(chuckles):
You just stepped on it, Alfie.

10:59.925 --> 11:00.960
CHRISTINE:
All the cracks are done!

11:01.027 --> 11:02.328
Look how far we're getting.

11:02.395 --> 11:04.864
Dirty Hands are very close
to finishing this first quarter.

11:04.930 --> 11:06.665
-ALFIE: Mike,
you see these lines?
-MIKE: Yeah, I'm trying

11:06.732 --> 11:07.967
-to bring some over.
-We can't have these lines.

11:08.034 --> 11:08.901
KEOGHAN:
Savage Crew working

as a team of five
as Sarah, the crew boss,

11:12.071 --> 11:13.806
continues to fill in the cracks.

11:13.873 --> 11:15.875
-It is gonna be close.
-JEROME: Get your footprints
out.

11:15.941 --> 11:17.309
You guys can't be
walking all over.

11:17.376 --> 11:18.677
KEOGHAN:
You're not there yet,
Dirty Hands.

11:18.744 --> 11:21.380
You got footprints,
you got raised material.

11:21.447 --> 11:22.815
-ALFIE: Stay with me.
-HANGER: Yeah.
-MIKE: Yep.

11:22.882 --> 11:24.383
-ALFIE: I'm leading.

-TAK: Is that good?
-JEROME: Yeah, Jerry.

11:26.652 --> 11:27.820
KEOGHAN:
Dirty Hands looking

11:27.887 --> 11:28.854
for a check
on the first quarter.

11:28.921 --> 11:31.057
-Check.
-Thumbs up for Dirty Hands.

11:31.123 --> 11:32.925
Jerry, can we have a check?

11:32.992 --> 11:34.026
Please?

11:34.093 --> 11:35.828
KEOGHAN:
Okay, Savage Crew

11:35.895 --> 11:37.997
with the first quarter clear,
moving on to the second.

11:38.064 --> 11:39.865
Both teams have

11:39.932 --> 11:41.367
a quarter of
their workspace done.

11:41.434 --> 11:44.003
Savage Crew have finished their
cracks, finally.

11:44.070 --> 11:46.539
Now Sarah can join
her team and help out.

11:46.605 --> 11:48.574
-TAK: Tell me when,
tell me when.
-JEROME: Go, go, go, go.

11:48.641 --> 11:50.943
-HANGER: Come on, Sarah.
-ALFIE: Sarah, pull that one
piece in the middle, that's it.

11:51.010 --> 11:52.878
Sarah, don't worry about
straightening that, just pull--

11:52.945 --> 11:54.880
-Sarah, look at me.
-Bro, we have to,
it's gonna set.

11:54.947 --> 11:56.916
Right there, I promise you,
we will get it.

11:56.982 --> 11:59.518
<i>As a superintendent,</i>
<i>when a building gets built,</i>

11:59.585 --> 12:01.454

<i>So it's always on me.</i>

12:02.855 --> 12:04.990
So I'm used to assuming
that responsibility.

12:05.057 --> 12:06.792
Stay together.

12:06.859 --> 12:08.828
I don't give a rip
about who's in charge of what.

12:08.894 --> 12:10.196
I need results.

12:10.262 --> 12:11.897
SARAH:
Just a suggestion,

12:11.964 --> 12:13.833
two people doing this way,
one person comes up.

12:13.899 --> 12:15.134
We still have seams to break.

12:15.201 --> 12:16.902

<i>HANGER:</i>
<i>At this point,</i>

<i>between Dirty Hands</i>
<i>and Savage Crew.</i>

12:20.906 --> 12:22.975
We have this
if we just stick together.

12:23.042 --> 12:24.743
You have to follow
the crew boss.

12:24.810 --> 12:25.811
We agreed we would follow
the crew boss.

12:25.878 --> 12:27.847
The saying,
"Old habits die hard"

12:27.913 --> 12:30.249
is definitely true
in our-our team.

12:30.316 --> 12:33.352
We have a lot of strong
A personalities.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.888
-Elizabeth, get on board!
-I am fixing your mistakes

-All right, well, then, stop.

-Just stop, we'll have to
fix this problem.
-Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

12:40.893 --> 12:42.361

One person needs to talk.

12:42.428 --> 12:44.130

I am, but nobody's listening.

12:51.003 --> 12:52.404

One person needs to talk.

And then being torn
between Alfie,

12:59.912 --> 13:02.715
<i>who's saying one thing,</i>
<i>and then Sarah's the crew bos,</i>

13:02.781 --> 13:04.783
and it's making me
lose my focus.

I got footprints is why
I'm covering this.

13:06.051 --> 13:07.586
Stop stepping when we're done.

13:07.653 --> 13:09.255
HANGER:
You got to listen to Alfie.

13:09.321 --> 13:10.656
I'm just so torn.

13:10.723 --> 13:11.924
We just got to do
what Sarah says.

13:11.991 --> 13:13.626
She's the crew boss.

13:13.692 --> 13:16.028
-Sarah, what do
you want us to do?
-What do you want to us to do?

13:16.095 --> 13:17.696

-HANGER: Okay, you heard her.
<i>-SARAH: It was a mess.</i>

13:19.198 --> 13:21.267
There was no organization.

You guys, if we don't
work together on this,

13:22.868 --> 13:24.203

<i>SARAH:</i>
<i>I didn't want to add</i>

to voice my opinion

13:28.207 --> 13:31.043

more confusing for everybody.

13:31.110 --> 13:32.978

13:33.045 --> 13:34.380
<i>SARAH:</i>
<i>In the military,</i>

13:34.446 --> 13:36.115
we would call that situation
"a soup sandwich,"

and, um, it was definitely that.

13:38.584 --> 13:40.152

13:40.219 --> 13:41.854
-Check.

Even with the battle of wills,
Savage Crew still in this.

13:47.226 --> 13:49.728
Can you guys get
on the same page and catch up?

13:49.795 --> 13:51.030
ALFIE:
Start turning towards the line.

13:51.096 --> 13:53.566

15:42.041 --> 15:44.209
But Savage Crew,
they're right there with them,

15:44.276 --> 15:45.778
refusing to give up.

15:45.844 --> 15:47.279
-It is gonna be close.
-HANGER: Go, go, go, go, go.

15:47.346 --> 15:49.181
Nice, guys.

15:49.248 --> 15:51.617
-ELIZABETH: We just got
a little spot up here.
-JEROME: Take what you need.

15:51.684 --> 15:52.618
HANGER:
Come on, go, go, go.
Come on, guys.

15:52.685 --> 15:54.953
Quincey, go, go, go, go-- Hey!

15:55.020 --> 15:55.988
KEOGHAN:
Now they got it, Jerry.

15:56.055 --> 15:57.823
Look at that
beautiful technique.

15:57.890 --> 15:59.825
JEROME:
Nice, Kalimba!

15:59.892 --> 16:01.060
We're almost there, let's go.

16:01.126 --> 16:02.428
On the truck, let's go.

16:02.494 --> 16:04.830
-Pack up everything.
-KALIMBA: Tools on the truck.

16:04.897 --> 16:06.665
-ALFIE: I got it, come on.
-Are we good?

16:06.732 --> 16:07.966
TAK:
Good?

16:08.033 --> 16:09.501
Jerry, do we have a thumbs-up?

16:09.568 --> 16:10.936
-It's a check.
-We have a thumbs-up

16:11.003 --> 16:12.671
-on Dirty Hands!
-(cheering)

16:14.506 --> 16:16.041
(whooping)

16:19.845 --> 16:21.013
(grunting)

16:21.080 --> 16:22.981
JEROME:
60 G's!

16:25.150 --> 16:27.086
(whooping)

16:27.152 --> 16:29.121
This one was
for all the outcasts, guys.

16:29.188 --> 16:31.123
-Yeah, baby!
-KALIMBA: For Nigel.

16:31.190 --> 16:32.658
-KALIMBA: For Nigel.
-ALL: For Nigel.

16:32.725 --> 16:35.494
-LIA: Thank you, everyone.
-(sniffling)

16:35.561 --> 16:38.997
<i>CHRISTINE:</i>
<i>I was so happy that, you kno,</i>
<i>we could dedicate that win</i>

16:39.064 --> 16:40.999
to, you know,
Lia's nephew Nigel,

16:41.066 --> 16:44.002
because he would have been
my age today.

16:44.069 --> 16:46.705
-This means so much.
-(laughs): Yeah!

16:46.772 --> 16:49.308
We won in loving memory
of Nigel.

16:49.375 --> 16:51.377
<i>I don't think I've ever huggd</i>
<i>anybody as hard</i>

16:51.443 --> 16:52.845
<i>as I hugged Quincey.</i>

16:52.911 --> 16:54.947
<i>You just needed to share</i>
<i>that joy, you know?</i>

16:55.013 --> 16:57.383
<i>And so we were hugging</i>
<i>each other, crying.</i>

16:57.449 --> 17:00.119
<i>It was just unleashed emotion</i>
<i>and joy.</i>

17:00.185 --> 17:04.056
<i>I can't ever remember feelin,</i>
<i>like, that exuberant over,</i>

17:04.123 --> 17:06.325
<i>you know,</i>
<i>accomplishing something.</i>

17:06.392 --> 17:07.993
<i>QUINCEY:</i>
<i>I wasn't able to help my team</i>

17:08.060 --> 17:09.995
back in 2005,

17:10.062 --> 17:12.898
<i>and so to help Dirty Hands</i>
<i>win this championship</i>

17:12.965 --> 17:14.733
<i>on</i> Tough As Nails

17:14.800 --> 17:16.835
gave me that redemption
that I needed.

17:20.239 --> 17:21.807
<i>KELSY:</i>
<i>It's just a nightmare.</i>

17:21.874 --> 17:23.409
<i>Dirty Hands beat us</i>
<i>fair and square,</i>

17:23.475 --> 17:26.245
and they deserve it,
'cause we were a mess.

17:26.311 --> 17:28.480
I know, brother. Tough.

17:29.715 --> 17:31.250
<i>SARAH:</i>
<i>I honestly felt like, you know,</i>

17:31.316 --> 17:33.085
we-we defeated ourselves.

17:33.152 --> 17:37.489
<i>I'm feeling 60K broker</i>
<i>and, uh, not really happy.</i>

17:39.324 --> 17:40.993
<i>ALFIE:</i>
<i>Dirty Hands takes the win.</i>

17:41.059 --> 17:44.163
<i>Any chance of that money</i>
<i>coming to my family is done.</i>

17:44.229 --> 17:45.798
<i>A-And it's over what?</i>

17:45.864 --> 17:48.100
That we don't agree
on something?

17:51.103 --> 17:53.138
Dirty Hands,
I am pleased to tell you

17:53.205 --> 17:55.107
that you won
today's team challenge.

17:55.174 --> 17:58.610
That means you have won
$12,000 for today's job...

17:58.677 --> 17:59.778
-(applause)
-Yes, sir.

17:59.845 --> 18:00.813
HANGER:
Yeah!

18:00.879 --> 18:02.748
...and today's Badge of Honor.

18:02.815 --> 18:06.919
But you are also the winners
of $60,000.

18:06.985 --> 18:08.554
You are the official winners

18:08.620 --> 18:11.990
of the team competition
on<i> Tough As Nails.</i>

18:12.057 --> 18:14.092
(Jerome whooping)

18:14.159 --> 18:15.994
Jerome, you're the crew boss,
you get the money.

18:16.061 --> 18:18.630
-LIA: Go get it, Jerome.
<i>-JEROME: Finishing that</i>
<i>was a relief.</i>

18:18.697 --> 18:20.132
We got excited,
actually excited,

18:20.199 --> 18:22.000
that-that's full of 60 G's, bro.

18:22.067 --> 18:24.403
<i>That's gonna do wonders.</i>

18:24.470 --> 18:26.271
That's some blessing
right there already.

18:26.338 --> 18:28.640
Savage Crew, even though
Dirty Hands have won

18:28.707 --> 18:30.142
the overall team competition,

18:30.209 --> 18:31.977
you will have a moment
for redemption.

18:32.044 --> 18:34.079
There's $12,000 that's up
for the next team challenge.

18:34.146 --> 18:38.016
You can win the next one.
You can get that $12,000.

18:38.083 --> 18:39.084
We got to come together
as a family.

18:39.151 --> 18:41.954
I mean, today was not a family.

18:42.020 --> 18:43.088
It-it was a broken family.

18:43.155 --> 18:44.990
KEOGHAN:
That was a tough day.

18:45.057 --> 18:47.092
So we're gonna be transitioning
from the team competition,

18:47.159 --> 18:49.595
go back to the individual
competition.

18:49.661 --> 18:52.197
Six tough competitors.

18:52.264 --> 18:56.568
By the end of tomorrow,
we will be down to just five.

19:02.508 --> 19:04.610
MIKE:
I'm just gonna cut through
all the crap.

19:04.676 --> 19:06.745
I'm angry, I'm upset.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.947
Because I know how good we are,

19:09.014 --> 19:11.116
and we just fell apart.

19:11.183 --> 19:13.552
I don't ever break down
like this,

19:13.619 --> 19:15.554
and that's how much it
means to me.

19:15.621 --> 19:18.290
I've had all this weight
on my shoulders

19:18.357 --> 19:19.625
since the very beginning,

19:19.691 --> 19:22.895
because I picked you guys
to be on this team.

19:22.961 --> 19:25.097
And we're just breaking apart.

19:25.163 --> 19:26.999
It hurts right here.

19:27.065 --> 19:30.002
So we need to focus
on the next challenge.

19:30.068 --> 19:35.073
I need us to get back
to where we are a family.

19:35.140 --> 19:36.308
-Yeah.
-Where we communicate,

19:36.375 --> 19:39.945
because there is still
$12,000 on the table.

19:40.012 --> 19:42.414
<i>Sometimes you have</i>
<i>to be strong enough</i>

19:42.481 --> 19:43.916
to say something, be loud,

19:43.982 --> 19:45.417
<i>because we're falling apart,</i>

19:45.484 --> 19:47.119
<i>and I don't like that feeling.</i>

19:47.185 --> 19:48.320
I want us to be close again.

19:48.387 --> 19:50.088
We need that money.

19:50.155 --> 19:52.591
I bust my ass every single day

19:52.658 --> 19:54.593
to provide for my family.

19:54.660 --> 19:58.263
So we need to provide
for our family: Savage Crew.

19:58.330 --> 20:01.833
<i>SARAH:</i>
<i>I know it's bad</i>
<i>when Mike gets upset like tha,</i>

20:01.900 --> 20:04.002
because he's the one that
kind of keeps us all grounded.

20:04.069 --> 20:07.272
<i>He's always really</i>
<i>kumbaya, chill,</i>

20:07.339 --> 20:09.775
so for him to, you know,
feel that upset,

20:09.841 --> 20:11.610
<i>I knew this was</i>
<i>probably the worst</i>

20:11.677 --> 20:13.679
<i>-that we had been as a team.</i>
-MIKE: We need

20:13.745 --> 20:16.882
to get it together
and brush this off.

20:26.692 --> 20:27.492
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>Yesterday's team challenge</i>

20:27.559 --> 20:29.995
was really rough
for Savage Crew,

20:30.062 --> 20:32.030
<i>but I can't dwell on the past.</i>

20:32.097 --> 20:34.366
<i>It's getting closer and closr</i>
<i>to getting that $200,000</i>

20:34.433 --> 20:37.402
<i>and that Ford Super Duty.</i>
<i>Today's the day</i>

20:37.469 --> 20:40.372
where I'm fighting
for my family at home.

20:40.439 --> 20:42.240
Good morning!

20:42.307 --> 20:43.475
Everybody who's punched out,

20:43.542 --> 20:45.444
make yourself comfortable
on the truck.

20:45.510 --> 20:48.614
<i>TAK:</i>
<i>My confidence has grown</i>
<i>because I'm still here, but</i>

20:48.680 --> 20:50.816
I'm not ever going
to take it for granted.

20:50.882 --> 20:53.318
<i>I'm ready to sweat,</i>
<i>I'm ready to work.</i>

20:53.385 --> 20:55.287
I'm ready to bust my butt.

20:55.354 --> 20:56.688
Welcome back to your jobsite.

20:56.755 --> 20:58.790
What a nice job you did, and
you know what's happening today?

20:58.857 --> 21:00.459
The battle lines

21:00.525 --> 21:01.693
are being drawn.
We're down to six.

21:01.760 --> 21:04.363
<i>ELIZABETH:</i>
<i>I'm here to test myself,</i>

21:04.429 --> 21:05.397
<i>and I don't want</i>
<i>to talk anymore.</i>

21:05.464 --> 21:06.798
I just want to do.

21:06.865 --> 21:08.767
I just want to show everybody
what I can do.

21:08.834 --> 21:10.469
Does anybody know when

21:10.535 --> 21:12.237
lines were first painted
on the roads in America?

21:12.304 --> 21:15.240
-1911.
-Are you serious, Quincey?

21:15.307 --> 21:18.210
-Yes.
-1911. There you go, Quincey.

21:18.276 --> 21:21.146
-Hey.
-Anyway, everybody,
say good morning to Jerry.

21:21.213 --> 21:22.881
-(overlapping greetings)
-KEOGHAN: Jerry, could you

21:22.948 --> 21:24.216
-show us how it's done?
-Absolutely.

21:24.282 --> 21:27.386
KEOGHAN:
Beautiful straight line.

21:27.452 --> 21:29.888
-Not his first time doing that.
-KEOGHAN: No.

21:29.955 --> 21:32.224
He's done it a few times.
Thank you, Jerry. Beautiful.

21:32.290 --> 21:35.227
So, that's how you do it
the easy way, but

21:35.293 --> 21:36.428
this show is called
<i>Tough As Nails,</i>

21:36.495 --> 21:37.663
so you will be doing it
the hard way.

21:37.729 --> 21:38.997
Quincey, I see you smiling.

21:39.064 --> 21:42.668
Today your job is
to paint ten parking spots,

21:42.734 --> 21:45.003
and you're gonna be doing it
the old-fashioned way.

21:45.070 --> 21:46.438
-Old school.
-With some paint brushes

21:46.505 --> 21:47.906
-and some paint.
-No.

21:47.973 --> 21:52.177
Two of the parking spots
are ADA parking spots

21:52.244 --> 21:54.346
for those people
who have disabilities.

21:54.413 --> 21:55.981
When the work whistle blows,

21:56.048 --> 21:58.850
<i>you will run down</i>
<i>to these wagons, grab the tae</i>

21:58.917 --> 22:02.554
<i>to mark the lines, blue and</i>
<i>white paint, and hammer drill.</i>

22:02.621 --> 22:05.123
What do you need those for?
Well, the ADAs

22:05.190 --> 22:06.525
<i>have car stops,</i>
<i>so you'll be drilling holes</i>

22:06.591 --> 22:09.961
<i>and hammering in rebar</i>
<i>to hold them in place.</i>

22:10.028 --> 22:12.464
Your work site must be
swept clean.

22:12.531 --> 22:13.965
When you cross the finish line
with all your equipment,

22:14.032 --> 22:15.467
you'll have completed the job.

22:15.534 --> 22:17.302
This is about precision.

22:17.369 --> 22:19.805
It's about
getting your lines straight.

22:19.871 --> 22:21.573
It's about working efficiently.

22:21.640 --> 22:26.244
And the winner today-- what do
they get? A deluxe barbecue.

22:26.311 --> 22:27.879
-Hey.
-Yeah.
-KEOGHAN: Yeah.

22:27.946 --> 22:29.614
The last two of you
to finish today

22:29.681 --> 22:33.251
will be going into overtime,
and before the sun sets,

22:33.318 --> 22:37.756
one of you will be punching out.
We will be down to five.

22:37.823 --> 22:40.258
-Ready to get to work? Yeah!
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

22:40.325 --> 22:41.326
Line up. Let's do it!

22:41.393 --> 22:43.095
<i>QUINCEY:</i>
<i>I'm not winded.</i>

22:43.161 --> 22:45.664
I'm not fatigued.
I'm just determined.

22:45.731 --> 22:50.168
<i>LIA:</i>
<i>Going into the competition,</i>
<i>my mom always inspires me.</i>

22:50.235 --> 22:52.938
Just being alive and breathing
seems to be inspiring to me,

22:53.004 --> 22:55.340
<i>and so, I feel a responsibility</i>

22:55.407 --> 22:57.676
<i>to live this dream</i>
<i>the best I can.</i>

22:57.743 --> 23:01.246
<i>Hopefully, I can take that</i>
<i>all the way to the very end.</i>

23:01.313 --> 23:03.348
KEOGHAN:
Do not be the last two
to get the job done.

23:03.415 --> 23:06.084
You'll be going into overtime.

23:06.151 --> 23:07.452
On the work whistle.

23:11.423 --> 23:13.425
-(work whistle blows)
-KELSY: Come on, come on!

23:13.492 --> 23:15.694
KEOGHAN:
Ooh, look at Mike.

23:15.761 --> 23:17.395
-He's flying.
-He's pretty fast.

23:17.462 --> 23:18.930
-ALFIE: He is quick, right?
-KALIMBA: Yeah.

23:21.967 --> 23:24.269
Oops. Easy does it.

23:24.336 --> 23:26.538
KEOGHAN:
Ah, straight away,
all our competitors

23:26.605 --> 23:30.342
are getting to work
on the ADA parking spots.

23:31.443 --> 23:33.912
Tak has the hammer drill.

23:33.979 --> 23:35.947
-(drilling)
-JERRY: He has

23:36.014 --> 23:37.716
a good, uh, method right there.

23:37.783 --> 23:39.885
<i>TAK:</i>
<i>I knew that the concrete part</i>

23:39.951 --> 23:41.253
<i>was gonna be really hard,</i>

23:41.319 --> 23:43.321
so that's the first thing
I attack.

23:43.388 --> 23:47.092
<i>These challenges</i>
<i>are not just fast.</i>

23:47.159 --> 23:49.795
<i>You have to kind of</i>
<i>keep calm mentally.</i>

23:55.367 --> 23:58.403
KEOGHAN:
Tak will be the first
to get his car stop in place.

23:58.470 --> 24:03.108
Lia, leaning into that drill.
Beautiful technique.

24:03.175 --> 24:04.543
HANGER:
I guarantee Lia's done this.

24:04.609 --> 24:07.445
(chuckling) She's done
a little bit of everything, man.

24:08.480 --> 24:11.383
<i>QUINCEY:</i>
<i>I pull out my drill,</i>
<i>and then bam!</i>

24:11.449 --> 24:13.451
<i>My drill bit comes out</i>
<i>of my drill.</i>

24:13.518 --> 24:16.555
It's stuck in there. I only got
this, only got about two inches

24:16.621 --> 24:19.157
<i>of drill bit to work with.</i>
<i>Try to get it out.</i>

24:21.293 --> 24:24.162
I tried to get it back on the
drill, and it keeps slipping up.

24:26.364 --> 24:28.099
KEOGHAN:
Something not tightening there?

24:28.166 --> 24:31.570
<i>-QUINCEY: I'm like, "Oh, gosh."</i>
-KEOGHAN: Uh-oh.

24:31.636 --> 24:33.471
-Keeps missing.
-Got to rightey tight.

24:33.538 --> 24:36.074
Drill bit never got tightened.
This is where

24:36.141 --> 24:37.576
the pressure really
starts to show.

24:37.642 --> 24:39.945
(drill whirring)

24:40.011 --> 24:42.447
-Elizabeth!
-Takes skills

24:42.514 --> 24:44.115
-to get that.
-Skill and strength.

24:44.182 --> 24:45.717
<i>ELIZABETH:</i>
<i>It doesn't make sense</i>

24:45.784 --> 24:47.953
<i>to go back and forth</i>
<i>between painting</i>

24:48.019 --> 24:50.322
and other tasks,
so, if I install the car stops,

24:50.388 --> 24:54.226
and I sweep the area clean,
I'm ready to paint.

24:54.292 --> 24:56.595
KEOGHAN:
Good idea to be sweeping up
before you move on.

24:56.661 --> 24:59.331
Mike has obviously
skipped that step,

24:59.397 --> 25:02.000
and he's really struggling
with that tape.

25:03.001 --> 25:04.936
It's not going to stick with
all that dust on the ground.

25:05.003 --> 25:06.438
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>I'm, you know,</i>

25:06.504 --> 25:08.006
fumbling around with that tape.

25:08.073 --> 25:10.175
KELSY:
Come on, Mike.

25:10.242 --> 25:11.243
What is he doing?

25:11.309 --> 25:13.278
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>Man, this is...</i>

25:13.345 --> 25:14.946
<i>this is gonna be tough now</i>

25:15.013 --> 25:16.915
<i>because I just made it toughr</i>
<i>on myself. I'm like,</i>

25:16.982 --> 25:18.950
"Mike, you should have just
cleaned this up."

25:19.017 --> 25:21.553
KEOGHAN:
Elizabeth has both
her car stops in place

25:21.620 --> 25:23.288
and a lot of her painting.

25:23.355 --> 25:26.191
Jerome is painting now.
He's decided to do his painting

25:26.258 --> 25:28.393
before he does his car stops.
That's going to allow time

25:28.460 --> 25:30.395
for the paint to dry. Good move.

25:30.462 --> 25:33.298
<i>LIA:</i>
<i>My strategy is to start</i>
<i>with the blue paint</i>

25:33.365 --> 25:34.366
for the ADA symbols.

25:34.432 --> 25:35.934
<i>Give that time to dry</i>

25:36.001 --> 25:37.235
<i>before I can put</i>
<i>some white paint on it</i>

25:37.302 --> 25:38.937
<i>for the symbol itself.</i>

25:39.004 --> 25:40.272
So I want
to jump on that first.

25:40.338 --> 25:42.540
(humming)

25:42.607 --> 25:44.709
<i>I was just trying to kind of</i>

25:44.776 --> 25:47.112
sing to myself a little bit
as I went along...

25:47.178 --> 25:49.648
(humming)

25:49.714 --> 25:52.117
<i>...to make it less of</i>
<i>a competition and more of jut</i>

25:52.183 --> 25:54.386
doing a task that...
that I'm comfortable with.

25:54.452 --> 25:57.289
Oh, don't spill it, girl.
Don't spill it.

25:57.355 --> 25:58.556
<i>If I'm comfortable</i>

25:58.623 --> 26:00.425
with what I'm doing,
it'll move along.

26:00.492 --> 26:01.893
KEOGHAN:
Wow. Elizabeth

26:01.960 --> 26:03.561
already moving forward
with her white lines,

26:03.628 --> 26:06.364
leaving her blue spots to dry.

26:06.431 --> 26:08.033
Jerome's following
in her footsteps,

26:08.099 --> 26:09.534
using the same strategy,

26:09.601 --> 26:12.337
taping up those lines
ready for painting.

26:12.404 --> 26:14.272
That's the most time-consuming
part of this job.

26:14.339 --> 26:15.373
<i>JEROME:</i>
<i>Back was sore,</i>

26:15.440 --> 26:18.109
your-your core.
My knees got bust up.

26:18.176 --> 26:19.844
<i>The pavement was hot, so,</i>

26:19.911 --> 26:21.880
who can tape up
the parking lot the fastest?

26:21.947 --> 26:24.616
That was the win-or-lose
situation right there.

26:26.318 --> 26:27.886
KEOGHAN:
Elizabeth flying today.

26:27.953 --> 26:30.021
-Look at that masking technique.
-Yeah.

26:30.088 --> 26:32.624
You can't go any faster
than that, seriously.

26:32.691 --> 26:36.227
<i>ELIZABETH:</i>
<i>The technique I was using</i>
<i>was a tai chi technique.</i>

26:36.294 --> 26:39.698
The master level, you are able
to stay down in a very, very low

26:39.764 --> 26:41.766
<i>position</i>
<i>and move along the ground,</i>

26:41.833 --> 26:43.435
<i>and I've been practicing</i>
<i>this technique</i>

26:43.501 --> 26:45.270
for the last year and a half.

26:45.337 --> 26:47.238
KEOGHAN:
Elizabeth and Jerome
have a slight lead,

26:47.305 --> 26:49.274
but Lia, Tak, Mike, and Quincey

26:49.341 --> 26:51.743
starting to mask up their lines,
so,

26:51.810 --> 26:53.979
we still have a race
on our hands.

26:54.045 --> 26:56.748
JERRY:
Everybody's working very
efficient and working hard.

26:56.815 --> 26:59.384
Yeah, very smart. Anybody
you'd like on your crew?

26:59.451 --> 27:01.286
-All of 'em, actually. Yeah.
-You'd like 'em all?

27:09.427 --> 27:13.365
You can cook one steak
medium rare on this road. Yow!

27:13.431 --> 27:18.536
-I'm sure that asphalt's hot.
-Oh, heck, yeah.
-Oh, yeah.

27:18.603 --> 27:22.941
I was feeling for them, but I
was glad that I wasn't doing it.

27:23.008 --> 27:24.576
KEOGHAN:
Sweat is pouring off Mike.

27:24.642 --> 27:26.211
This is hot work
out here in the sun, Jerry.

27:26.277 --> 27:28.213
I don't know how
you do it every day.

27:28.279 --> 27:29.748
-Yes.
-Hot work.

27:29.814 --> 27:31.850
LIA:
Hope this is water-based paint

27:31.916 --> 27:34.185
-'cause I'm sweating in it.
-(laughter)

27:34.252 --> 27:37.022
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>I do have a little experience</i>
<i>with painting,</i>

27:37.088 --> 27:40.058
<i>but my wife would say otherwise</i>
<i>because</i>

27:40.125 --> 27:42.360
I'm not very good at it.
(laughs)

27:42.427 --> 27:45.230
Oh, man.

27:45.296 --> 27:48.066
I stood on it,
painted inside, and

27:48.133 --> 27:51.269
it was still bleeding out.
I couldn't get it to be tight.

27:51.336 --> 27:53.238
KEOGHAN:
Time is ticking away.

27:53.304 --> 27:54.439
You're gonna have
to do some tidying up.

27:54.506 --> 27:56.408
So I have to go back
and do that one then?

27:56.474 --> 27:58.710
-Yeah, that's not gonna pass.
-TAK: Oh, man.

27:58.777 --> 28:01.312
KEOGHAN:
Mike and Quincey still
have a lot

28:01.379 --> 28:03.214
of taping and painting left.
Elizabeth, on the other hand,

28:03.281 --> 28:05.250
is working
on her second stencil.

28:05.316 --> 28:08.753
The only thing she's got
to do is stencil the blue.

28:08.820 --> 28:11.589
KEOGHAN:
And unlike Lia and Jerome,
Elizabeth has

28:11.656 --> 28:14.392
really kept her workspace
very clean.

28:14.459 --> 28:17.095
Roll that dolly
back over the line, and...

28:17.162 --> 28:20.865
Elizabeth gets the job done!
Congratulations, Elizabeth.

28:20.932 --> 28:22.267
<i>ELIZABETH:</i>
<i>Maybe people</i>

28:22.333 --> 28:23.868
could have thought before

28:23.935 --> 28:27.372
<i>that I wasn't really a threa,</i>
<i>but now,</i>

28:27.439 --> 28:28.940
I think they, maybe,
are starting to realize

28:29.007 --> 28:30.442
that they do need to be

28:30.508 --> 28:31.676
<i>concerned about me.</i>

28:31.743 --> 28:32.844
You're in this, Mike!

28:32.911 --> 28:34.846
Second place is yours.

28:34.913 --> 28:36.047
We still got more here,
Mike, on the line.

28:36.114 --> 28:37.282
JERRY:
Clean up the edge

28:37.348 --> 28:38.716
with black, black.

28:38.783 --> 28:40.919
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>I grabbed the black paint,</i>

28:40.985 --> 28:42.620
and just ran as fast as I could

28:42.687 --> 28:44.556
to just get
those touch-up spots.

28:44.622 --> 28:45.757
Push!

28:45.824 --> 28:46.891
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>All right, Mike, just...</i>

28:46.958 --> 28:48.226
<i>just don't go into overtime.</i>

28:48.293 --> 28:50.295
KEOGHAN:
And...

28:50.361 --> 28:51.596
Lia gets the job done!

28:51.663 --> 28:54.099
-She's safe from overtime.
-Thank you.

28:54.165 --> 28:57.302
Lia is the biggest sleeper
in-in this contest.

28:57.368 --> 28:59.304
KALIMBA:
Tak, speed it up, bud.

28:59.370 --> 29:00.772
<i>TAK:</i>
<i>As I'm working, I just hear</i>

29:00.839 --> 29:03.174
people getting done, you know?
Finished already.

29:03.241 --> 29:05.243
KEOGHAN:
Jerome gets the job done!

29:05.310 --> 29:06.711
Yeah, Jerome!

29:06.778 --> 29:09.314
I was thinking,
oh, God, I'm behind.

29:09.380 --> 29:11.716
-Oh, man.
-KEOGHAN: Tak, Quincey, and Mike

29:11.783 --> 29:13.351
battling it out.

29:13.418 --> 29:16.154
This is where
you've got to keep your cool.

29:16.221 --> 29:19.324
You rush this job,
don't get it right,

29:19.390 --> 29:20.225
you'll find yourself
in overtime.

29:20.291 --> 29:23.061
Mike's got to pick up the pace.

29:23.128 --> 29:25.063
<i>SARAH:</i>
<i>I'm really nervous</i>
<i>when I see Mike fall behind.</i>

29:25.130 --> 29:26.431
ALFIE:
Let's go, Mike!

29:26.498 --> 29:28.166
<i>SARAH: Usually,</i>
<i>he's somewhere in the top,</i>

29:28.233 --> 29:30.401
and this is probably the slowest
I've seen him move.

29:30.468 --> 29:32.737
-Oh, man.
-CHRISTINE: Pick up the pace!

29:32.804 --> 29:34.839
This is when
my stomach starts turning.

29:34.906 --> 29:37.342
KELSY:
Ah! I can't stand it.

29:41.946 --> 29:43.581
KEOGHAN:
Tak, Quincey, and Mike

29:43.648 --> 29:45.517
desperate to stay out
of overtime.

29:45.583 --> 29:50.021
Only one guaranteed spot left
in the individual competition.

29:50.088 --> 29:52.524
The first to finish
final touch-ups and pack up

29:52.590 --> 29:54.192
all your tools gets that spot.

29:54.259 --> 29:57.929
Nobody wants to go
into overtime. Sweat is pouring

29:57.996 --> 30:00.932
off Mike. Quincey trying
to stay out of overtime.

30:00.999 --> 30:04.202
He knows what it's like.
He's been there twice, Jerry.

30:04.269 --> 30:05.436
Let's go, let's go!

30:06.437 --> 30:07.772
LIA:
Go, Quince.

30:07.839 --> 30:09.174
-Push!
-LIA: Go, Tak!

30:09.240 --> 30:11.075
KEOGHAN:
Quincey's making a turn
with his dolly.

30:11.142 --> 30:12.844
Tak is trying to brush up.

30:12.911 --> 30:16.681
Get it across the line, Quincey,
and your stencil, your stencil.

30:16.748 --> 30:19.918
Oh, too late.
Mike crossing the line.

30:19.984 --> 30:21.853
(grunting)

30:21.920 --> 30:23.154
Mike gets the job done,
safe from overtime.

30:23.221 --> 30:26.257
-Yeah!
-Yeah! Oh, my God.

30:26.324 --> 30:27.992
-No way.
-(crying)

30:28.059 --> 30:29.661
<i>MIKE:</i>
<i>Man, that was</i>
<i>an intense challenge.</i>

30:29.727 --> 30:31.296
<i>I mean, when he says</i>

30:31.362 --> 30:33.831
I finished and I'm not going
into overtime, it was

30:33.898 --> 30:35.133
<i>a huge relief to me.</i>

30:35.200 --> 30:37.769
<i>That would have hurt me a lo,</i>
<i>if I couldn't</i>

30:37.835 --> 30:41.039
do my best
to win this for my family.

30:41.105 --> 30:42.207
Tak, I'm sorry to tell you,

30:42.273 --> 30:44.876
you will be going
into overtime with Quincey.

30:44.943 --> 30:47.512
Let's see if
we can have some fun, man.

30:47.579 --> 30:49.647
<i>TAK:</i>
<i>First time for everything,</i>
<i>so I'm ready.</i>

30:49.714 --> 30:51.115
Right now,
I just got to rest up

30:51.182 --> 30:53.184
so I can compete
in the overtime.

30:53.251 --> 30:55.520
<i>Me and Quincey is brothers, but</i>

30:55.587 --> 30:57.889
when we go in there, I mean,
we're gonna compete hard.

30:57.956 --> 30:59.357
Jerry, it was so close, right?

30:59.424 --> 31:00.959
-It was very tight, it was...
-I-I...

31:01.025 --> 31:02.827
And Mike literally just
pipped you at the line there.

31:02.894 --> 31:04.495
Quincey, I'm sorry.

31:04.562 --> 31:06.097
<i>QUINCEY:</i>
<i>That little bit of time,</i>
<i>you know, it took me</i>

31:06.164 --> 31:08.433
<i>to get the stencil and</i>
<i>get across the threshold there.</i>

31:08.499 --> 31:10.668
<i>So a few seconds just cost me.</i>

31:10.735 --> 31:12.837
Ultimately, ended me up again,
for the third time, in overtime.

31:12.904 --> 31:15.273
Mike, what was going through
your mind there, at the end?

31:15.340 --> 31:17.175
It hurt a lot for me.

31:17.242 --> 31:19.677
Sometimes it sucks
to be six-four and 240, so...

31:19.744 --> 31:22.146
-(laughter)
-Everybody made me work for it.

31:22.213 --> 31:24.249
-Elizabeth, amazing job today.
-Thanks.

31:24.315 --> 31:27.151
That-that shows your skills
right there, and how...

31:27.218 --> 31:29.087
how competitive you are.

31:29.153 --> 31:31.823
And I want to applaud you on
that, 'cause you did amazing.

31:31.889 --> 31:34.025
-(applause)
-Thank you.

31:34.092 --> 31:37.195
And Elizabeth, our winner today,
gets the barbeque.

31:37.262 --> 31:41.266
Elizabeth, your first win was
a well-deserved win, and, uh,

31:41.332 --> 31:43.034
how about a round of applause
for Jerry for putting up

31:43.101 --> 31:44.702
-with your work?
-ELIZABETH:
Oh, thank you, Jerry. Great job.

31:44.769 --> 31:46.638
-Jerry, thank you
for having us here.
-Yeah, thank you.

31:46.704 --> 31:48.606
Thank you for giving us
some insight into what you do

31:48.673 --> 31:49.807
every day out here
in the hot sun

31:49.874 --> 31:51.542
with your team.
Appreciate it.

31:51.609 --> 31:54.846
Tak and Quincey, gonna find out
who's punching out today.

31:54.912 --> 31:56.714
-Everybody ready
to get to overtime?
-ALL: Yeah.

31:56.781 --> 31:58.783
<i>KEOGHAN:</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>

32:02.787 --> 32:05.056
<i>QUINCEY:</i>
<i>I wanted redemption</i>
<i>when I first came here.</i>

32:05.123 --> 32:07.558
-Yeah!
<i>-QUINCEY: I felt</i>
<i>that redemption when</i>

32:07.625 --> 32:08.760
me and my team, Dirty Hands,

32:08.826 --> 32:10.328
<i>won the team challenge.</i>

32:10.395 --> 32:12.096
<i>So at this point, you know,</i>
<i>I'll just take it all the wa.</i>

32:12.163 --> 32:14.265
<i>You know,</i>
<i>I'm-I'm too close not to.</i>

32:14.332 --> 32:16.634
I gonna give it all I got
and go for it.

32:16.701 --> 32:20.104
-KEOGHAN:
You smell the barbeque?
-Yeah, smells good.

32:20.171 --> 32:22.807
<i>If I won this 200K,</i>
<i>that would be big.</i>

32:22.874 --> 32:26.077
<i>In Hawaii, our cost of living</i>
<i>is real expensive over there.</i>

32:26.144 --> 32:27.145
We're a small island.

32:27.211 --> 32:28.946
<i>We don't have</i>
<i>that much opportunities,</i>

32:29.013 --> 32:30.581
<i>but if I can be up here</i>

32:30.648 --> 32:34.252
showing, you know, just me,
a small person from the...

32:34.319 --> 32:35.520
one of the smallest towns,

32:35.586 --> 32:38.623
<i>you know, making it this far,</i>
<i>it's-it's like</i>

32:38.690 --> 32:41.492
an honor for me
to represent Hawaii.

32:41.559 --> 32:44.529
This is a chance
to stay in contention

32:44.595 --> 32:46.030
for the
<i>Tough As Nails</i> title.

32:46.097 --> 32:47.699
-There is a lot at stake.
-Yup.

32:47.765 --> 32:48.933
KEOGHAN: You have
four competitors sitting

32:49.000 --> 32:51.102
on a truck who are going through

32:51.169 --> 32:53.971
to the final five,
and there's only one spot left.

32:54.038 --> 32:58.109
So you are looking at two
identical VIP parking areas.

32:58.176 --> 33:00.178
When this place gets packed,

33:00.244 --> 33:02.447
VIP parking is
what everybody wants.

33:02.513 --> 33:06.384
There are 25 parking spots
in the two lots.

33:06.451 --> 33:09.954
There are 21 cars in each lot.

33:10.021 --> 33:12.657
That means
there are four empty spaces.

33:12.724 --> 33:15.293
When the work whistle blows,
run over to the parked cars

33:15.360 --> 33:18.329
and figure out which car
you want to move first.

33:18.396 --> 33:21.232
<i>Make note of the number</i>
<i>on the dashboard,</i>

33:21.299 --> 33:24.635
<i>then run to your valet stand,</i>
<i>pick up the key,</i>

33:24.702 --> 33:26.404
<i>which has the corresponding</i>
<i>number attached to it.</i>

33:26.471 --> 33:30.074
You can only grab one key
at a time, so choose carefully.

33:30.141 --> 33:32.677
Your job-- it's pretty simple.

33:32.744 --> 33:35.279
Just to get one
of those Ford F-150s

33:35.346 --> 33:37.815
and park it into one
of these spots right here.

33:37.882 --> 33:40.251
That's it.
Think of this challenge

33:40.318 --> 33:42.487
as a giant slide puzzle.
If you do it,

33:42.553 --> 33:45.256
you will stay in contention
for the<i> Tough As Nails</i> title.

33:45.323 --> 33:48.459
If you finish last today,
you will be punching out.

33:48.526 --> 33:50.795
Are you ready
to get the job done?

33:50.862 --> 33:52.330
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
-Let me say this.

33:52.397 --> 33:55.133
Whatever happens here today,
you're both getting a barbeque.

33:55.199 --> 33:56.968
-Well, that's good.
-KEOGHAN: That's good.

33:57.034 --> 33:58.703
-(laughter)
-QUINCEY: We both win.

33:58.770 --> 34:00.605
-(laughing)
-KEOGHAN: Let's get started.

34:00.671 --> 34:02.807
<i>QUINCEY:</i>
<i>I've never valet-parked a ca.</i>

34:02.874 --> 34:05.109
It's completely out
of my wheelhouse. No clue.

34:05.176 --> 34:08.146
<i>So I'm thinking, man,</i>
<i>how can I do this,</i>

34:08.212 --> 34:09.714
and do it right, do it first?

34:09.781 --> 34:11.282
KEOGHAN:
On the work whistle.

34:13.284 --> 34:15.086
(work whistle blows)

34:15.153 --> 34:17.488
(cheering)

34:19.056 --> 34:20.324
(muttering)

34:20.391 --> 34:22.160
<i>TAK:</i>
<i>I have no experience in vale.</i>

34:22.226 --> 34:24.061
I know how to drive.

34:25.797 --> 34:27.265
-KELSY: You got it, Quince.
<i>-QUINCEY: Biggest thing</i>

34:27.331 --> 34:29.434
I need to be worried about
for myself is, uh, making sure

34:29.500 --> 34:31.469
<i>that I come in</i>
<i>with a clear heart, clear mind,</i>

34:31.536 --> 34:33.104
<i>and you know, focus.</i>

34:33.171 --> 34:37.275
KEOGHAN:
Quincey's wipers are going on.

34:37.341 --> 34:39.911
-KELSY: Oh, Tak's already out.
-KALIMBA: Let's go, Tak.

34:39.977 --> 34:41.145
<i>TAK:</i>
<i>It felt great getting that lead.</i>

34:41.212 --> 34:42.280
<i>I'm hard to beat because,</i>

34:42.346 --> 34:44.182
<i>once I get the rhythm, I'm on.</i>

34:44.248 --> 34:45.616
KEOGHAN:
Quincey's trying
to get the car started.

34:45.683 --> 34:47.118
HANGER:
Let's go, Quincey.

34:47.185 --> 34:48.920
KEOGHAN:
Tak picks up
his second set of keys.

34:48.986 --> 34:51.155
Quincey struggling
to move his first car.

34:51.222 --> 34:52.356
KELSY:
What's happening?

34:52.423 --> 34:53.991
<i>Does he have the wrong key?</i>

35:00.231 --> 35:03.100
-Oh, Tak's already out.
-KALIMBA: Let's go, Tak.

35:03.167 --> 35:04.302
-(beeping)
-KEOGHAN: Quincey's trying

35:04.368 --> 35:06.304
-to get the car started.
-HANGER: Let's go, Quincey.

35:06.370 --> 35:08.105
KEOGHAN:
Tak out to an early lead.

35:08.172 --> 35:10.641
Quincey hasn't moved a car yet.

35:10.708 --> 35:13.978
First person to figure out this
giant parking-lot slide puzzle

35:14.045 --> 35:15.646
will be in the final four.

35:15.713 --> 35:17.081
<i>QUINCEY:</i>
<i>There's always something</i>

35:17.148 --> 35:18.282
<i>that's gonna trip you up,</i>
<i>something</i>

35:18.349 --> 35:20.384
<i>that's gonna challenge you.</i>
<i>The key is,</i>

35:20.451 --> 35:21.819
you don't quit.

35:21.886 --> 35:23.254
KEOGHAN:
Now he's got it going.

35:23.321 --> 35:25.256
He's backing up very slowly.

35:25.323 --> 35:28.226
CHRISTINE:
I don't know why
he took so long.

35:29.627 --> 35:31.496
HANGER:
Let's go, Quincey.

35:31.562 --> 35:33.297
-LIA: That's it, Tak.
-JEROME: Come on, boy.

35:33.364 --> 35:35.766
-Let's go, Quincey.
<i>-QUINCEY: You want to</i>
<i>make as less trips</i>

35:35.833 --> 35:37.235
<i>as possible</i>
<i>when you're getting the keys.</i>

35:37.301 --> 35:39.237
So when I run back
to take that key back,

35:39.303 --> 35:40.404
<i>instead of me running back</i>

35:40.471 --> 35:41.839
<i>to the parking lot</i>
<i>and look at the number,</i>

35:41.906 --> 35:43.107
<i>I already had that number</i>

35:43.174 --> 35:44.175
<i>in my head, so I could just</i>

35:44.242 --> 35:46.611
put this key down
and grab this one

35:46.677 --> 35:48.746
<i>and go back and move the car,</i>
<i>and that was my strategy</i>

35:48.813 --> 35:50.982
<i>for the remainder</i>
<i>of the challenge.</i>

35:51.048 --> 35:52.650
Ah.

35:52.717 --> 35:54.452
-Oh.
<i>-QUINCEY: Bam!</i>

35:54.519 --> 35:56.187
-Twisted my ankle.
-CHRISTINE: Come on, Quince.

35:56.254 --> 35:58.322
<i>QUINCEY:</i>
<i>But I keep going</i>
<i>because Tak is fast.</i>

35:58.389 --> 36:00.024
He's not slowing down.

36:01.692 --> 36:04.228
KEOGHAN:
Tak has moved four cars.

36:04.295 --> 36:06.898
Now he has an empty slot
in one of his rows,

36:06.964 --> 36:09.901
and he can move one of the cars
out of the row

36:09.967 --> 36:11.135
that's blocking his F-150,

36:11.202 --> 36:14.772
which he needs to park out front
to get the job done.

36:14.839 --> 36:17.909
How do you start the car?
Oh, brah.

36:17.975 --> 36:19.210
It's a push-to-start,
but the button

36:19.277 --> 36:21.879
<i>is not</i>
<i>by the steering wheel.</i>

36:21.946 --> 36:24.949
KEOGHAN:
And Quincey has tied it up.

36:25.016 --> 36:26.150
There's no button here.

36:26.217 --> 36:28.286
-LIA: Keep it moving.
-KELSY: You got it.

36:28.352 --> 36:30.121
-(engine starts)
-Aah!

36:30.187 --> 36:32.290
<i>Took some time</i>
<i>to figure it out, but,</i>

36:32.356 --> 36:33.624
yeah, I got it eventually.

36:33.691 --> 36:35.126
KEOGHAN: Quincey,
a slight lead ahead of Tak.

36:35.192 --> 36:36.260
-LIA: Hustle, hustle.
-HANGER: Let's go, Tak.

36:36.327 --> 36:38.062
-LIA: Hustle, hustle.
-JEROME: You got it, Tak.

36:38.129 --> 36:39.163
Tak is checking the number.

36:39.230 --> 36:40.598
He realizes

36:40.665 --> 36:42.733
-that he's got the wrong car.
-KELSY: Oh.

36:42.800 --> 36:44.835
When I got there, it was
the wrong number key, and

36:44.902 --> 36:46.804
-I had to run back.
-MIKE: Come on, Tak!

36:46.871 --> 36:48.172
<i>TAK:</i>
<i>I don't know where Quincey i.</i>

36:48.239 --> 36:51.275
KEOGHAN:
Quincey moving his sixth car.

36:51.342 --> 36:52.510
While Tak has made a mistake,

36:52.577 --> 36:54.645
and that's cost him
an extra run.

36:54.712 --> 36:56.113
I just know
I got to hurry up

36:56.180 --> 36:58.316
because I made
a couple mistakes already.

36:58.382 --> 37:00.518
-ELIZABETH: Stay calm.
-KEOGHAN: Quincey
with a slight lead.

37:00.585 --> 37:02.687
KELSY:
Good job, Quincey!

37:02.753 --> 37:03.821
KEOGHAN:
Nice move, Quincey.

37:03.888 --> 37:05.356
-Yes.
-HANGER: Come on, Quincey.

37:09.060 --> 37:11.062
KELSY:
Good job, Quincey! Good job!

37:11.128 --> 37:12.396
HANGER:
Good job, Tak.

37:12.463 --> 37:14.231
CHRISTINE:
Come on, guys. Fight for it!

37:14.298 --> 37:16.233
<i>KALIMBA:</i>
<i>Seeing Quincey and Tak--</i>

37:16.300 --> 37:17.401
it's like
having your two children

37:17.468 --> 37:18.903
go up against each other.

37:18.970 --> 37:20.371
You just want them both
to do their best.

37:20.438 --> 37:23.307
<i>I think Tak's speed is</i>
<i>an advantage, but I also thik</i>

37:23.374 --> 37:26.510
<i>that Quincey's a beast,</i>
<i>and moving cars</i>

37:26.577 --> 37:28.346
is just something that I'm sure
he's done a lot.

37:28.412 --> 37:30.848
So, this is anybody's game.

37:30.915 --> 37:32.250
HANGER:
Quincey, dig deep.

37:32.316 --> 37:33.751
-KELSY: Quincey, hustle.
-HANGER: Come on, brother.

37:33.818 --> 37:35.186
KEOGHAN:
Nice move, Quincey.

37:35.252 --> 37:38.556
Now only two cars blocking
Quincey and Tak's F-150.

37:38.623 --> 37:40.491
How bad do you want it?
Come on!

37:40.558 --> 37:42.026
-KEOGHAN: How bad do
you want it?
<i>-QUINCEY: Every time I run</i>

37:42.093 --> 37:43.594
<i>to the valet box, I see Tak.</i>
<i>He's-he's at</i>

37:43.661 --> 37:45.363
the valet box, so I'm like,
"Man, we're neck and neck."

37:45.429 --> 37:47.498
<i>I got to pick it up.</i>

37:47.565 --> 37:49.700
KEOGHAN:
We are down to one car

37:49.767 --> 37:52.903
in front of Quincey
and Tak's F-150. A dead heat.

37:52.970 --> 37:54.538
-CHRISTINE:
Come on, Tak. Hustle!
-KEOGHAN: Another quick up

37:54.605 --> 37:56.841
-for Quincey.
Who wants this more?
-KELSY: Hurry!

37:56.907 --> 37:58.109
KEOGHAN:
Very quick grab coming from Tak.

37:58.175 --> 38:00.945
-JEROME: Go, go, go, go, go, go!
-Go, go, go, go!

38:01.012 --> 38:03.147

KELSY:
Come on! Quincey, hurry!

38:10.021 --> 38:12.156

There are seconds
separating Tak and Quincey.

KELSY:
Hurry, Quincey!

38:13.691 --> 38:15.059
KEOGHAN:
Quincey back, looking
for his next car.

38:15.126 --> 38:17.028
KELSY:
Quincey!

38:17.094 --> 38:20.197
KEOGHAN:
But he can't find the final key.

38:20.264 --> 38:23.300
KELSY:
Come on, Quincey. You got it.

38:23.367 --> 38:24.468

Go! Go, Tak.

38:29.540 --> 38:31.842

-and down to just one car.
-HANGER: Same time.

Hurry! Hurry!

38:42.920 --> 38:44.722

LIA: Hurry!
What's the number?!

39:04.709 --> 39:07.311
KEOGHAN:
Who wants this more?

39:07.378 --> 39:09.146
Looking for the final key
to their Ford F-150.

39:09.213 --> 39:11.816
Oh, and it looks like
Tak grabbed the wrong key.

39:11.882 --> 39:13.284
KALIMBA:
Come on, Tak.

39:13.350 --> 39:16.153
KEOGHAN:
This is Quincey's chance.

39:16.220 --> 39:17.788
Tak gets in.

39:17.855 --> 39:20.157
-Quincey starts up
his Ford F-150.
-KELSY: Hurry!

39:20.224 --> 39:22.293
Here comes Quincey.
He's got to make the turn.

39:22.359 --> 39:24.628
Lining up. Here comes Tak.

39:25.429 --> 39:27.198
And...

make sure every move I make is
a step closer to that $200,000.

39:52.389 --> 39:55.326
It was neck and neck
the whole way through.

39:55.392 --> 39:57.495
You must have noticed
where each other was

39:57.561 --> 39:59.563
-while you were doing this.
-I ain't never seen Tak.

39:59.630 --> 40:02.900
I kind of just going off
of this over here.

40:02.967 --> 40:04.435
-(laughter)
-KEOGHAN: Tak, I really think

40:04.502 --> 40:06.737
it came down to one wrong key
that you picked up.

40:06.804 --> 40:08.405
You had one extra little run.

40:08.472 --> 40:09.740
Yeah, I read the wrong number.

40:09.807 --> 40:12.276
<i>I was one mistake away</i>

40:12.343 --> 40:13.911
<i>from advancing. I feel like</i>

a little further.

40:15.246 --> 40:16.914
And, uh, your fellow
Hawaiian, Jerome--

40:16.981 --> 40:20.084
is... he's, uh...
he was living it with you

40:20.151 --> 40:22.520
-all the way through.
-He's my Hawaiian brother, man.

<i>JEROME:</i>
<i>I'll get over it, but</i>

<i>how close</i>

KEOGHAN:
Quincey, congratulations.

40:38.302 --> 40:39.403
You're in the final five.

40:39.470 --> 40:40.871
Unfortunately, Tak, I do

40:40.938 --> 40:42.573
need to ask you to punch out of

40:42.640 --> 40:43.808
the individual competition.

40:49.613 --> 40:51.382
<i>TAK:</i>
<i>Coming to</i> Tough As Nails,

40:51.448 --> 40:55.152
<i>I learned our team</i>
<i>is like ohana.</i>

41:04.228 --> 41:06.163
<i>TAK:</i>
<i>From this competition,</i>

41:06.230 --> 41:08.265
I gained a lot of close friends.

41:08.332 --> 41:10.534
That's like
the-the biggest win.

41:10.601 --> 41:12.670
<i>Not only my brother Jerome,</i>
<i>you know,</i>

41:12.736 --> 41:14.438
<i>but everybody here.</i>

41:14.505 --> 41:16.440
Like, we bonded real good.

41:16.507 --> 41:19.443
And... yeah.

41:19.510 --> 41:22.079
<i>I'm a better man</i>
<i>for it because now I get</i>

41:22.146 --> 41:25.349
<i>to show my family back home</i>
<i>the family that I have here.</i>

41:25.416 --> 41:28.185
We're down
to the final five now. Tak,

41:28.252 --> 41:30.554
you got to change gears now,
go back to the team competition.

41:30.621 --> 41:32.690
-Yup.
-You have that win
under your belt

41:32.756 --> 41:34.525
with Dirty Hands.
One more team competition.

41:34.592 --> 41:36.760
Savage Crew's coming after you.

41:36.827 --> 41:39.730
I am personally hoping
that Savage Crew unite

41:39.797 --> 41:42.533
and come back strong and give
you a real fight for the money.

41:42.600 --> 41:45.469
-Sorry if we disappoint you.
-(laughter)

41:45.536 --> 41:48.639
-(overlapping chatter)
-That was good!

41:48.706 --> 41:50.541
How about some barbeque, huh?

41:50.608 --> 41:52.076
-Everybody hungry?
-(cheering)

41:52.142 --> 41:53.811
All right, get into it,

41:53.878 --> 41:56.046
and I will see you
bright and early tomorrow.

41:56.113 --> 41:58.249
-KELSY: Plate? Here you go.
-LIA: Oh, thank you.

41:58.315 --> 41:59.717

-There you go.

41:59.783 --> 42:01.485
-I'm gonna fix you
a plate, okay?
-KELSY: Yeah.

42:01.552 --> 42:03.487
