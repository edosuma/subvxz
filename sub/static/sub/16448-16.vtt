Uh, Mr. Gable, uh,
the carbon-monoxide alarm

00:05.039 --> 00:06.507
was going off in my room
last night.

00:06.574 --> 00:10.144
Oh, hey, you know, that's, uh,
just a low-battery warning.

00:10.211 --> 00:13.181
No, no, no. I think it's
a lot more serious than that.

00:13.247 --> 00:15.183
Well, did it sound
like this? Like --

00:15.249 --> 00:17.751
Chirp! Chirp! Chirp!

00:17.818 --> 00:19.587
Or was it
more like a --

00:28.162 --> 00:29.763
Okay. That wasn't
one of the choices.

00:29.830 --> 00:31.365
If you're not gonna
take this serious,

00:31.432 --> 00:32.433
then I'm not
taking it serious, either.

No, no, no, no,
I'm taking it seriously!

00:34.034 --> 00:35.503
That's what
it sounded like!

00:35.569 --> 00:38.506
[ Shrieking ]

00:38.572 --> 00:42.776
That sounds
like a velociraptor
about to have some pups.

00:42.843 --> 00:44.778
Okay. Fine. Fine.

00:44.845 --> 00:47.781
But just know this --
If it is carbon monoxide,

00:47.848 --> 00:50.284
then while everyone's
taking their final breaths,

00:50.351 --> 00:51.752
you will be
making this wish.

00:51.819 --> 00:53.321
"I wish I had listened
to Chale."

Yeah, well,
as long as I don't have to

00:54.688 --> 00:57.458

Thanks for the heads up.
I feel like an idiot now.

They're coming,
and I dressed like this?

once again.

Jackie and Peter --
They're the nice couple we see

at mass every week.

01:19.680 --> 01:20.781
Why do we need
new friends?

Isn't that kind of like
a slap in the face

01:22.450 --> 01:24.385
to the friends
we already have? You know?

Kind of like we're saying,
"You know what?

01:26.320 --> 01:30.124
We thought about it, and...
you're not good enough."

01:30.191 --> 01:31.759
Look,
I love your friends,

but every time
we go out with the guys,

all you do is you tell
old cop stories.

I mean, seriously,
how many times

01:37.398 --> 01:39.500
can I listen
to the Galaxy Bagels saga?

in progress,

01:44.205 --> 01:45.706
I almost get shot,

but apparently,
that story's got
not enough sizzle for you.

Okay. Because
I've heard it 500 times.

01:51.712 --> 01:54.114
I could tell it.
"So, the customers
are on the floor,

a drink here,

go to the new

are fun.

They are both getting
their scuba licenses.

with the rules.

Okay, if he's a vegan,
I'm out.

02:32.586 --> 02:36.424
If he sleeps with
a full-body pillow,
I am so out.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.492
If he has a lizard
or rare fish...

02:38.559 --> 02:40.894
Yeah, I know how you feel
about fish people.

02:40.961 --> 02:42.896
No, fish people
are the worst, okay?

02:42.963 --> 02:46.166
And if he moisturizes,
I am totally out.

You moisturize.

and you don't even buy
the good lotion I like.

02:53.974 --> 02:55.909
Well, yeah, because
it's like 50 bucks a bottle,

02:55.976 --> 02:58.312
and you just slather it on
like mayonnaise.

Well, because
it was working!

todefinitelyfix it?

18:39.586 --> 18:40.820
Oh!

18:43.823 --> 18:45.392
Okay,
so we got the keys.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.327
We just got to finish packing,
and then, I mean,

18:47.394 --> 18:49.028
if Dr. Wang is
as good as you say he is,

18:49.095 --> 18:51.631
we are on our way.
Best vacation ever!

18:51.698 --> 18:54.000
Oh, yeah. And you got to try
some of his banana bread.

18:54.066 --> 18:55.768
Let me get
some of that for you.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:55.835 --> 18:57.804
Oh, it's
right over there.
Bring it. Bring it.

18:59.105 --> 19:00.440
Ah, I got it.

19:00.507 --> 19:01.774
Okay.

19:01.841 --> 19:02.975
I don't know where
he gets his bananas from,

19:03.042 --> 19:05.645
but they have been
kissed by God.

19:05.712 --> 19:07.647
[ Groans ]

19:07.714 --> 19:09.782
Cheater.
Party of two.

19:09.849 --> 19:12.419
Your table's waiting.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.787
Peter.
What are you doing here?

19:14.854 --> 19:16.789
You know what?
Just save it.

19:16.856 --> 19:19.091
I know you've been
seeing Dr. Wang on the side.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.394
We're -- we're sorry.
We're sorry.

19:21.461 --> 19:22.429
We're sorry.

19:22.495 --> 19:25.232
You know what?
This hurts.

19:25.298 --> 19:30.136
Now, where does that leave us
vis-à-vis Florida?

19:30.203 --> 19:31.804
That's not
gonna happen.

19:31.871 --> 19:34.807
At least when
my other clients leave me,

19:34.874 --> 19:38.177
they have the decency
to look me in the eye and say,

19:38.245 --> 19:41.147
"You are
a terrible chiropractor!"

19:56.596 --> 20:00.166
The guy was
emptying out the register.

20:00.233 --> 20:03.135
I sneak up behind him,
I put my gun right to his ear,

20:03.202 --> 20:06.839
and I'm like, "Hey.
Bagel shop's closed."

20:06.906 --> 20:08.308
Wow.

20:08.375 --> 20:09.842
That is incredible.

20:09.909 --> 20:11.844
Are we talking about
the Galaxy Bagels on Sunrise?

20:11.911 --> 20:12.912
Mm-hmm.

20:12.979 --> 20:14.281
That's right next to
my cardio barre.

20:14.347 --> 20:15.682
Oh, I've been dying
to go there,

20:15.748 --> 20:17.183
but the classes
are always full.

20:17.250 --> 20:18.618
Oh, my friend runs it.
What?

20:18.685 --> 20:20.353
I'll give you her card.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.221
That'd be amazing.

20:22.289 --> 20:23.723
You're a brave man,
Kevin.

20:23.790 --> 20:25.492
Thank you
for your service.

20:25.558 --> 20:26.859
Oh. You kidding me?
No problem.

20:26.926 --> 20:28.227
Hey, are you a Met fan?

20:28.295 --> 20:29.762
Pbht. Huge!

20:29.829 --> 20:31.398
You know
what we got to do?

20:31.464 --> 20:34.133
We got to go down to Florida,
catch a little spring
training!

20:34.200 --> 20:36.269
I'd love to, but...

20:36.336 --> 20:38.338
I can't leave my fish
for that long.

20:48.881 --> 20:51.518
Good night, everybody.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.953
Lock up when
you're done, Donna!

20:56.255 --> 20:59.626
* Don't want no
sweet perfume *

20:59.692 --> 21:02.895
* Shake your finger,
bust your move *

21:02.962 --> 21:06.899
* Doo, doo, doot-doo, doo,
doo, doo, doo, doo *

21:06.966 --> 21:10.370
* Oh! Yeah

21:10.437 --> 21:13.540
* Don't want
no high-heeled shoes *

21:13.606 --> 21:16.208
* I just don't want no
