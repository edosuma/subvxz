00:10.043 --> 00:12.579
<i>Tonight, on Bachelor in
Paradise Canada...</i>

00:16.049 --> 00:17.851
Now that these 3 guys
have showed up...

00:19.686 --> 00:22.989
Unless another girl shows up,
3 guys are going home.

00:23.056 --> 00:25.458
Seeing the person who
you're interested

00:25.525 --> 00:26.860
with someone else...

00:26.926 --> 00:28.328
He did give me a smooch.

00:28.395 --> 00:30.797
It can make you
feel a certain way.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.298
There's only so
many men that can

00:32.365 --> 00:34.267
play on the court
at one time.

00:34.334 --> 00:37.537
Just stay in your own lane.
Don't try to mess things up.

00:37.604 --> 00:38.772
I'm marking my territory.

00:38.838 --> 00:39.839
It's like my dog
every morning.

00:39.906 --> 00:42.042
He goes out,
pees in the same spot,

00:42.108 --> 00:44.010
so when another little puppy
comes by, he knows,

00:44.077 --> 00:47.914
that's my spot.
Don't go there, bro.

00:47.981 --> 00:51.317
I searched, "how to win
ex-girlfriend back".

00:51.384 --> 00:52.519
Agh!

00:52.585 --> 00:54.287
My best chance at a
rose this week is

00:54.354 --> 00:56.823
a friendship
rose from Lisa.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.024
[Beep]!

00:58.091 --> 00:59.926
I'm not ready to go home.

00:59.993 --> 01:01.361

01:02.829 --> 01:04.497
You don't want to see
Illeana with other people.

Don't take me for granted
́cause I'll leave tomorrow.

01:06.533 --> 01:08.935
Dude, apparently, they
made out the whole time.

01:09.002 --> 01:10.637
- You're me!
- No, no, dude!

01:10.703 --> 01:13.406
My blood is boiling.

01:13.473 --> 01:15.675
Everyone needs to calm down.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.911
Kamil is getting
heated about it.

01:17.977 --> 01:20.580
He's pushed me
to the wayside.

01:20.647 --> 01:24.084
Like, what's left for me?

01:24.150 --> 01:25.919
This is the shit I was
talking about, man!

01:25.985 --> 01:27.954
This is the shit
I wanted to see!

01:28.021 --> 01:30.457
This is Paradise, this is
what it's all about.

01:30.523 --> 01:32.692

02:55.208 --> 02:56.976
I have a plan tonight

- Oh, my goodness.

02:59.479 --> 03:01.181
- Oh, hey.
- Oh, hey.

03:01.247 --> 03:02.582
It's nice to escape
a little bit.

03:02.649 --> 03:04.484
I don't want to just
show up to Paradise and

03:04.551 --> 03:06.019
get along with someone
and just hang out.

03:06.085 --> 03:08.087
I want to show that person
that I'm gonna put effort

03:08.154 --> 03:11.424
into spark things up and
have a lot of fun, too.

03:11.491 --> 03:13.193
I mean,
can you look at that?

03:13.259 --> 03:14.827
I just wanted to do
special things.

03:14.894 --> 03:16.796
I mean, you do
spoil me over here.

03:16.863 --> 03:18.998
Am I the luckiest girl
in Paradise?

03:19.065 --> 03:21.467
My little Canadian
sunshine over here.

03:21.534 --> 03:23.136
- Little Canadian bacon.
-

03:23.203 --> 03:26.472
- Canadian jerky. Jerky?
- Oh, my God.

03:26.539 --> 03:28.541
For myself to feel this way,
it's scary ́cause

03:28.608 --> 03:29.876
I didn't think I'd
ever get here.

03:29.943 --> 03:32.078
She just makes me very
comfortable and very happy.

03:32.145 --> 03:34.480
I haven't been this happy
in a long time.

03:34.547 --> 03:36.182
I'm just like so,
so crazy about you.

03:36.249 --> 03:37.917
I think so highly of you.

03:37.984 --> 03:40.720
There's really no way that
someone could come in and

03:40.787 --> 03:43.790
take your place.
You should know that, okay?

03:43.856 --> 03:46.726
Mhm. I just appreciate you
and like want to do

03:46.793 --> 03:47.760
special things
for you, babe.

03:47.827 --> 03:50.063
- Look how pretty it looks.
- I know, I know.

04:01.274 --> 04:03.876
Hey, man. I'm at
100% right now.

04:03.943 --> 04:04.978
Feeling good?

04:05.078 --> 04:08.081
Dealing with everything from
the other night to now.

04:08.147 --> 04:10.550
I need that energy, man.
I need that, you know?

04:10.617 --> 04:12.619
- You need that energy?
- Yeah, I need that.

04:12.685 --> 04:14.153
I need that energy
from you, bro.

04:14.220 --> 04:15.955
So, a new guy
just came in.

04:16.022 --> 04:18.224
Josh, good looking guy,
well put together.

04:18.291 --> 04:21.261
He asked Angela
out on a date.

04:21.327 --> 04:23.696
Angela and I, you know,
we have a connection and,

04:23.763 --> 04:25.965
seeing the person who
you're interested

04:26.032 --> 04:29.769
with someone else, it can
make you feel a certain way.

04:29.836 --> 04:31.170
I've been speaking to Stacy.

04:32.772 --> 04:35.541
It'd be wrong for me to sit
here and scold her for

04:35.608 --> 04:38.911
accepting the date card.
I don't know,

04:38.978 --> 04:43.149
I'm just waiting to see
what happens.

04:43.216 --> 04:45.952
- We need a drink.
- Yeah, seriously.

04:46.019 --> 04:48.921
- Oh, it's busy out here.
- Oh, hello!

04:48.988 --> 04:51.958
- Hi, guys! How we doing?
- How are ya?

04:52.025 --> 04:53.660
- How you doing?
- Good.

04:53.726 --> 04:55.028
How was your date?

05:00.333 --> 05:04.604
I was jealous,
I was watching.

05:04.671 --> 05:05.438
Oh, you could?

05:05.538 --> 05:07.640
What's up, bro?
How you doing, man?

05:07.707 --> 05:08.574
- Good.
- How was the date?

05:08.641 --> 05:10.276
- It was good?
- Yeah, it was chill, man.

05:10.343 --> 05:12.712
- That trampoline's crazy.
- It looks fun, man.

05:12.779 --> 05:14.247
It was fun, all over
the place, man.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.616
We saw you guys.

05:16.683 --> 05:18.818
I was watching him, I'm like...
he's doing quite well.

05:18.885 --> 05:22.221
I know.

05:22.288 --> 05:23.890
It was a workout.

05:23.956 --> 05:25.124
Cool.

05:25.191 --> 05:27.960
This situation right here is
the hardest part of Paradise.

05:28.027 --> 05:31.197
It's not gonna deter me
from pursuing her.

05:31.264 --> 05:33.599
Angela, she has that
potential to be, you know,

05:33.666 --> 05:36.703
like wifey material.

05:36.769 --> 05:38.237
I had physical activity today.

05:38.304 --> 05:40.006
I'm gonna steal her.

05:40.073 --> 05:42.008
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

05:42.075 --> 05:45.611
Get it, bro. You got this,
baby, you got this, baby.

05:45.678 --> 05:48.348
Excuse me, bro.
That's my girl.

05:48.414 --> 05:50.183
You wanna go chat?
Wanna hang out?

05:50.249 --> 05:51.084
I haven't seen
you in a while.

05:51.150 --> 05:52.652
- Okay, alright, alright.
- Let's go.

05:52.719 --> 05:55.254
Alright, B-R-B.
How are ya?

05:55.321 --> 05:57.690
- I'm good.
- How was your day?

05:57.757 --> 05:59.358
- Good, good, how you doing?
- Good.

05:59.425 --> 06:01.961
It's been a minute.
You look nice though.

06:02.028 --> 06:04.731
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Cool, cool.

06:04.797 --> 06:07.667
Oh...

06:07.734 --> 06:09.635
How was your date though?
It was fun?

06:09.702 --> 06:10.903
It was good.
Yeah, he's so nice.

06:10.970 --> 06:12.004
We have...

06:12.071 --> 06:14.207
we have a decent
amount in common.

06:14.273 --> 06:16.809
- Did you guys kiss?
- Did we kiss?

06:16.876 --> 06:19.912
Yeah, he did give me,
he did give me a smooch.

06:19.979 --> 06:23.015
Mhm.

06:23.082 --> 06:25.985
I won't lie. He did.

06:26.052 --> 06:28.888
- Okay.
- How do you feel about that?

06:28.955 --> 06:31.924
No, I mean, you're
your own woman, so...

06:31.991 --> 06:33.659
You're entitled to do
what you know

06:33.726 --> 06:36.796
what you want to do
and, you know?

06:36.863 --> 06:39.165
- Yeah.
- I missed you though.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.633
- Did you?
- Yeah.

06:40.700 --> 06:45.238
I'm glad to hear that.
I was a little unsure.

06:45.304 --> 06:47.774
So, you had like your arm
around Stacy and I was like-

06:47.840 --> 06:50.109
- Oh, oh, my gosh.
- Okay.

06:50.176 --> 06:53.146
No, I guess, I don't know,
we've kind of spoken about,

06:53.212 --> 06:55.348
you know, being able
to explore different,

06:55.415 --> 06:57.183
different connections
and whatnot.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.685
You obviously had
that opportunity today.

06:59.752 --> 07:02.188
Honestly, like today
has kind of been

07:02.255 --> 07:04.423
an eye-opening day for me.

07:04.490 --> 07:07.160
- Okay.
- It really helped me...

07:07.226 --> 07:10.163
realize how much I
actually like you.

07:10.229 --> 07:12.932
Okay, well, that makes me
happy to hear.

07:12.999 --> 07:16.836
Thank you.
You got the- Oh, oh.

07:23.509 --> 07:24.811
You been waiting all
day for that?

07:24.877 --> 07:26.145
I've been waiting awhile,
I have.

07:33.152 --> 07:35.054
How do you say,
"how are you" in Russian?

07:35.121 --> 07:35.888
"Kak dela".

07:35.955 --> 07:37.356
- What is it?
- "Kak dela".

07:37.423 --> 07:38.958
- "Kak dela"?
- "Kak dela".

07:39.025 --> 07:42.195
"Kak dela, kak dela".

07:42.261 --> 07:43.396
You good?

07:43.463 --> 07:46.032
I mean, it's just like, I put
together something, right,

07:46.098 --> 07:47.967
and then she leaves.

07:48.034 --> 07:49.001
Yeah.

07:49.068 --> 07:50.970
So, it's just kind of like
a kick in the face.

07:51.037 --> 07:52.238
This is my whole
life story, right?

07:52.305 --> 07:56.843
Doing everything and then you
just like, it's just how it is.

07:56.909 --> 07:58.311
You never regret it.
You've never worked out

07:58.377 --> 07:59.579
and been like,
"Oh, I wish I didn't do it".

07:59.645 --> 08:01.447
No, you're always just like,
"Thank God, I did that, like,

08:01.514 --> 08:02.715
thank God I made the conscious
decision to do this".

08:02.782 --> 08:05.251
You're like, "Hey, that was a
great job this morning".

08:05.318 --> 08:09.021
So, do I just like not do good
things for people?

08:09.088 --> 08:13.025
No, no, no. Let's dial it
back and just think that

08:13.092 --> 08:14.894
they were just having
a conversation.

08:14.961 --> 08:17.296
Your head is going a mile
a minute right now.

08:17.363 --> 08:20.333
They look so solemn over there,
like, what the hell is going on?

08:20.399 --> 08:21.834
They just keep staring at us.

08:21.901 --> 08:23.236
Maybe they're
getting nervous.

08:23.302 --> 08:26.305
- I'm making my move.
-

08:26.372 --> 08:30.209
Don't take me for granted
́cause I, I'll leave tomorrow.

08:30.276 --> 08:32.745
If this ain't gonna
happen, I'll leave.

08:32.812 --> 08:35.414
So, go through this moment.
It's okay.

08:35.481 --> 08:36.949
Everyone's got
the same motive.

08:37.016 --> 08:39.285
They want to find
their person here.

08:39.352 --> 08:42.054
And, sometimes it
comes down to, like,

08:42.121 --> 08:44.857
some people wanting
that same person.

08:44.924 --> 08:47.260
- Do you want to grab a drink?
- Yeah, we can grab a drink.

08:47.326 --> 08:48.427
I'm getting a drink though
́cause like

08:48.494 --> 08:49.962
I've been empty for a bit.

08:50.029 --> 08:51.297
Are you good?
Do you want a hug?

08:51.364 --> 08:53.799
Don't do that, don't go
back to that place.

08:53.866 --> 08:56.302
- I know.
- You're fine, it's fine.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.137
Because I know
you're like me.

08:58.204 --> 09:00.206
I know exactly what I'd be
thinking in that moment.

09:00.273 --> 09:01.941
You're okay.
It's fine.

09:02.008 --> 09:04.143
Thank you.
I appreciate you.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.211
Thank you.

09:05.278 --> 09:06.879
You don't want to see
Illeana with other people.

09:06.946 --> 09:08.114
God, you're so Russian!

09:08.180 --> 09:10.349
The only Russian that doesn't
know what vodka tastes like.

09:10.416 --> 09:12.184
What can they possibly
be talking about?

09:12.251 --> 09:14.086
I can't believe you
finally grabbed me.

09:14.153 --> 09:16.322
I feel like I gave you
so many windows.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.391
How many more windows
did I need to give you?

09:18.457 --> 09:20.359
I am like purposely
going out of my way

09:20.426 --> 09:22.061
to give him these windows.

09:22.128 --> 09:23.262
I don't like seeing that.

09:23.329 --> 09:25.498
Tell me if I'm picking up
on social cues.

09:27.600 --> 09:28.935
You going back?
You want to chat?

09:29.001 --> 09:30.236
- Are you good?
- I'm chill.

09:30.303 --> 09:32.238
Yeah. Yeah, it's funny,
they think you're-

09:32.305 --> 09:34.040
they're worried over there.
You're just chilling.

09:34.106 --> 09:35.207
You're fine.

09:38.077 --> 09:41.247
I still think it would have to
take a miracle for someone

09:41.314 --> 09:42.949
to come in and blow her
away the way I am.

09:47.620 --> 09:48.754
<i>Coming up...</i>

09:48.821 --> 09:52.124
Just stay in your own lane.
Don't try to mess things up.

09:52.191 --> 09:53.426
I'm marking my territory.

09:53.492 --> 09:55.361
It's like my dog every
morning, he goes out,

09:55.428 --> 09:56.562
pees in the same spot.

09:56.629 --> 09:58.297
So, when another little
puppy comes by,

09:58.364 --> 09:59.865
he knows,
that's my spot.

09:59.932 --> 10:01.834
Don't go there, bro.

10:01.901 --> 10:03.169
- Brendan S.?
- Yeah?

10:03.235 --> 10:04.937
Do you like puppies ́cause
you're acting like

10:05.004 --> 10:06.238
a lost puppy right now.

10:06.305 --> 10:07.873
[Gasping]!

10:07.940 --> 10:10.443
He's a little chihuahua,
on his leash with Vay.

10:12.678 --> 10:15.381
- Yo, someone's here.
- Oh, my god!

10:15.448 --> 10:16.549
What the [beep]!

10:22.488 --> 10:27.026

It's a new day in Paradise.
Jeremy...

10:37.036 --> 10:39.905
decided he was the
new sheriff in town.

10:39.972 --> 10:41.307
He's the new cowboy.

10:41.374 --> 10:44.910
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

10:44.977 --> 10:46.278
He spits!

10:46.345 --> 10:48.214
Gotta give it to him, he looked
damn good in that hat.

10:51.384 --> 10:54.286
I'm enjoying the, just the
sunshine and the,

10:54.353 --> 10:56.489
the drinks and the friendship.

10:56.555 --> 10:59.291
Today, it's a new day.
We're on the beach.

10:59.358 --> 11:00.926
I have a good
feeling about today.

11:00.993 --> 11:03.129
I'm back. Something's
gonna happen today.

11:03.195 --> 11:05.031
Now that these 3 guys
have showed up,

11:05.097 --> 11:07.433
it means unless another
girl shows up,

11:07.500 --> 11:09.235
3 guys are going home.

11:09.301 --> 11:11.170
My best chance at a
rose this week is

11:11.237 --> 11:12.605
a friendship rose from Lisa.

11:12.672 --> 11:16.108
I searched "how to win
ex-girlfriend back".

11:16.175 --> 11:17.977
Agh! I've done that.

11:18.044 --> 11:21.480
Lisa and I have connected at
a very deep, heart level.

11:21.547 --> 11:24.116
And we want to help
each other find love.

11:24.183 --> 11:29.155
I've recently discovered
how much I don't know-

11:29.221 --> 11:31.190
- About yourself?
- About relationships.

11:31.257 --> 11:34.493
Ah, I was googling how to
flirt for a guy here, so...

11:34.560 --> 11:35.695
You're probably doing
better than me.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.598
- Alright.
- What do we got?

11:39.665 --> 11:41.567
Never seen so many
boxes in my time.

11:41.634 --> 11:43.969
I love packages.

11:44.036 --> 11:46.672
So, we go over to our group
sitting area and there are

11:46.739 --> 11:49.708
boxes with everyone's
names on them.

11:49.775 --> 11:52.745
And of course, mine name,
́cause they all say "Kits".

11:52.812 --> 11:55.481
- Guys, there's a card.
- Read it! Yeah!

11:55.548 --> 11:56.716
Do you guys
want me to read it?

11:56.782 --> 11:59.218
- Yeah!
- Okay.

11:59.285 --> 12:03.389
"Howdy, campers."
Howdy, campers!

12:04.523 --> 12:07.693
"Open your box and put
on the glasses inside.

12:07.760 --> 12:11.564
If you get clear lenses,
you must reveal a truth

12:11.630 --> 12:15.301
about your romantic feelings
for another camper.

12:15.367 --> 12:19.038
If you get sunglasses,
throw some shade

12:19.105 --> 12:21.207
at the camper
of your choice.

12:21.273 --> 12:24.076
It's time to open
your eyes."

12:24.143 --> 12:27.113
- Oh, wow.
- Oh, my God.

12:27.179 --> 12:30.216
I've got shade in my back
pocket for days.

12:30.282 --> 12:32.318
We're open.

12:32.384 --> 12:33.619
From nerd to cool.

12:37.223 --> 12:40.059
Alright, let's see
what we got.

12:40.126 --> 12:44.029
- Wow!
- Whoa!

12:44.096 --> 12:46.365
These Kits sunglasses
look amazing.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.100
I honestly can say that
I love each and

12:48.167 --> 12:49.602
every one of you in here.

12:49.668 --> 12:53.139
Oh!

12:53.205 --> 12:55.708
Alright, so I gotta throw some
shade at a camper.

12:55.774 --> 12:59.278
Throwing shade is telling
somebody something that

12:59.345 --> 13:01.080
maybe not anyone
else is telling them,

13:01.147 --> 13:02.381
but they need to hear.

13:02.448 --> 13:03.616
You know what, Joey,
I think you're gonna

13:03.682 --> 13:05.184
have to burn
that pink Speedo.

13:05.251 --> 13:08.788
- Oh!
- Wow!

13:08.854 --> 13:11.157
My man, Josh,
Brendan 2.0,

13:11.223 --> 13:13.425
I appreciate you for
taking Angela out.

13:13.492 --> 13:16.362
The boy is back so, you don't
need to be here anymore.

13:16.428 --> 13:17.797
Now that's shade.

13:17.863 --> 13:19.765
- Okay.
- Whoa, ho, ho!

13:19.832 --> 13:21.167
- They look good!
- Yes!

13:21.233 --> 13:22.168
They look good!

13:22.234 --> 13:26.071
I think Jeremy makes a
sexier cowboy than Joey.

13:26.138 --> 13:28.073
That's fighting words.
That is fighting words!

13:29.241 --> 13:31.277
There's a new, ah,
sheriff in town.

13:31.343 --> 13:32.578
Told me Jeremy's a
better-looking cowboy

13:32.645 --> 13:35.381
than I am, but little does
she know, I agree.

13:37.683 --> 13:39.318
- Oh, it is shade. Shit!
-

13:39.385 --> 13:42.354
- Whoa.
- Okay, Brendan S.?

13:42.421 --> 13:43.822
- Yeah.
- Do you like puppies?

13:43.889 --> 13:46.225
́Cause you're acting like a
lost puppy right now.

13:46.292 --> 13:47.359
Ah!

13:47.426 --> 13:48.661
Following Illeana home.

13:48.727 --> 13:50.496
- Oh!
- What did he say?

13:53.332 --> 13:57.636
He's a little chihuahua,
on his leash with Vay.

13:57.703 --> 13:59.705
Joey could think whatever
he wants to think,

13:59.772 --> 14:03.242
but I feel like he should worry
about what he has with...

14:03.309 --> 14:04.443
Veronique.

14:09.515 --> 14:10.649
Hm...

14:10.716 --> 14:14.253
- Wow, hey, how you doing?
- This is for everyone, I guess.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.188
Just stay in your own lane.

14:16.255 --> 14:19.458
If you see something that's
there for a person,

14:19.525 --> 14:21.327
don't try to ruin it.

14:21.393 --> 14:23.729
Everyone should just stay
in their own lane and,

14:23.796 --> 14:25.397
don't try to mess things up.

14:28.868 --> 14:32.238
Stay in your own lane?
Dude, this is Paradise.

14:32.304 --> 14:34.473
This is what it's all about.

14:34.540 --> 14:37.309
Don't come in my lane.
I'm marking my territory.

14:37.376 --> 14:38.477
It's like my dog
every morning.

14:38.544 --> 14:40.546
He goes out,
pees in the same spot,

14:40.613 --> 14:42.881
so when another little puppy
comes by, he knows,

14:42.948 --> 14:47.620
that's my spot.
Don't go there, bro.

14:47.686 --> 14:51.323
It's nice to know that he
doesn't really want anyone

14:51.390 --> 14:53.459
getting in the way of him and
I, but at the same time,

14:53.525 --> 14:56.362
it just came across as
little bit jealous and

14:56.428 --> 14:58.597
possessive in
the moment, so...

14:58.664 --> 15:00.332
I don't know,
it was kind of weird.

15:03.669 --> 15:05.504
Yeah, I guess the big
question is if I'm gonna

15:05.571 --> 15:06.772
stay in my lane right now.

15:06.839 --> 15:09.608
Oh!

15:09.675 --> 15:13.245
Honestly, Lisa, like...
I sat down with you and,

15:13.312 --> 15:14.446
I just really like that
you're yourself.

15:14.513 --> 15:16.315
You're just like so proud of
who you are and

15:16.382 --> 15:18.284
so forward about that.
I really like that.

15:18.350 --> 15:19.418
I thought that was really cool.

15:19.485 --> 15:21.186
- Don't make me cry.
- Aw!

15:21.253 --> 15:24.857
Josh saying anything about me
made me really happy because

15:24.923 --> 15:26.926
I feel like I haven't had
any positive affirmation

15:26.992 --> 15:28.560
from a guy here.
So, yeah,

15:28.627 --> 15:30.429
I was actually like
really surprised he said

15:30.496 --> 15:32.398
my name and it
made me feel a lot better.

15:32.464 --> 15:34.533
Oh, thank you.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.669
It seems like Angela's
already kind of engaged in

15:36.735 --> 15:37.703
something with someone else.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.339
But, I actually find Lisa
really cool as well.

15:40.406 --> 15:42.474
I know a lot of people find her
quirky and weird, but like,

15:42.541 --> 15:45.277
I love that she's just
passionate about what she does.

15:45.344 --> 15:47.780
It's hard for me to kind of
gauge where Josh is at

15:47.846 --> 15:50.649
because I've had
conversations with Josh.

15:50.716 --> 15:52.518
And I've had
conversations with Lisa.

15:52.584 --> 15:55.654
And at no point am I getting
the idea that there's

15:55.721 --> 15:58.590
really true romance
going on here.

15:58.657 --> 16:00.626
He hasn't earned my trust.

16:04.463 --> 16:05.698
Well, we have this now.

16:05.764 --> 16:07.633
So, if we go in the sun,
we're very well protected.

16:07.700 --> 16:08.734
Alright, should we try it?

16:08.801 --> 16:10.436
Yeah, let's take a
walk or something.

16:10.502 --> 16:11.670
Let's do it.
It might be hot, but-

16:11.737 --> 16:13.439
Well, we have
protection.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.875
No, no, no, let me
be a gentleman.

16:16.942 --> 16:18.477
With Lisa, even from
the beginning,

16:18.544 --> 16:19.878
there was a bit of a spark.

16:19.945 --> 16:21.880
And I'd say that's really
starting to blossom.

16:21.947 --> 16:24.316
I just thought about our
conversation last night.

16:24.383 --> 16:25.951
You are really cool.

16:26.018 --> 16:27.486
It's nice to get another
guy in here that

16:27.553 --> 16:29.021
I'm actually
like talking to.

16:29.088 --> 16:31.657
I feel like people making a
last-minute attempt to be like,

16:31.724 --> 16:33.292
Lisa, all of a sudden,
I've known you for a week,

16:33.359 --> 16:34.460
but like how's it going?

16:34.526 --> 16:35.794
́Cause they're scared
of going home.

16:35.861 --> 16:37.262
And I'm not getting
that vibe from you.

16:37.329 --> 16:38.530
I feel like we're
vibing really well,

16:38.597 --> 16:41.333
and the conversation just
flows really easily.

16:41.400 --> 16:44.436
I could totally see me and Josh
getting more romantic.

16:44.503 --> 16:47.272
I don't know, I guess
we'll see what happens.

16:47.339 --> 16:50.342
All I know is that like, I wan--
there's so many adventures-

16:50.409 --> 16:51.677
Oh, is he wearing
the Speedo?

16:55.748 --> 16:57.816
I knew it, I knew it!
I knew it!

16:57.883 --> 17:01.353
- Oh, my gosh, it's back!
- There you go, Vay.

17:01.420 --> 17:02.955
He's a great looking guy.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.990
It's just his, like style
that like threw me off.

17:05.057 --> 17:08.293
But, that didn't stop me.
It's not stopping us.

17:08.360 --> 17:11.430
- I think the Speedo, like-
- Joey!

17:11.497 --> 17:14.733
What?

17:14.800 --> 17:16.535
What's up?

17:16.602 --> 17:18.971
You know a rose ceremony's
coming up, eh?

17:19.038 --> 17:21.573
And you're literally
playing with fire.

17:21.640 --> 17:23.308
Vay, Vay, do you want to have
a conversation right now?

17:23.375 --> 17:26.011
Yeah, let's go, let's go.
Sorry, sorry, Joey.

17:26.078 --> 17:28.080
I'm gonna go talk to Chris.
Chris, let's go.

17:28.147 --> 17:30.549
You're going with them?

17:30.616 --> 17:31.583
Let's go, Chris.

17:31.650 --> 17:32.551
You guys wanted me
to come, right?

17:32.618 --> 17:34.486
- Nope, nope, nope.
- Let's go, let's go.

17:34.553 --> 17:37.389
Vay seems cool.
It's like, why...

17:37.456 --> 17:41.860
why is she with
Joey? Like...

17:41.927 --> 17:44.396
I don't know, like, it.

17:46.865 --> 17:48.467
It's my turn.

17:48.534 --> 17:50.569
She left her drink, score.

17:52.004 --> 17:52.938
So, how are you?

17:53.005 --> 17:54.773
Probably going home.

17:54.840 --> 17:56.642
What if there's a new girl
that comes in today?

17:56.708 --> 17:58.744
Or it could be another guy.

17:58.811 --> 18:01.847
4- no, there's not gonna
be 4 guys going home.

18:01.914 --> 18:05.651
Could be. So, tell me
about you and Joey.

18:05.717 --> 18:07.719
I just, like,
I don't get it.

18:07.786 --> 18:10.589
I'm a sucker for like
funny, silly guys.

18:10.656 --> 18:13.826
The wardrobe is a
little much for me,

18:13.892 --> 18:15.894
but moments like this,
I'm like,

18:15.961 --> 18:18.096
wow, I'm getting
myself into a lot.

18:18.163 --> 18:19.331
My man.

18:19.398 --> 18:21.366
I even told him, I'm like,
"If a new guy walks in or if

18:21.433 --> 18:23.502
like, I'm still gonna
explore my options".

18:23.569 --> 18:25.370
Like, I owe that to myself.

18:25.437 --> 18:27.706
'Cause like, like, I've been
thinking about you.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.641
And like...

18:29.708 --> 18:31.910
more than just the casual.

18:31.977 --> 18:34.446
I'm, I'm not gonna let
anything sort of

18:34.513 --> 18:36.582
get in my way of my journey.

18:36.648 --> 18:39.117
Okay, I like that.
You shouldn't.

18:39.184 --> 18:41.787
Just because someone has a
connection, it's early on.

18:41.854 --> 18:43.455
And this is why I'm talking
to you like this.

18:43.522 --> 18:45.624
It's like, I'm just kind of
gauging, like,

18:45.691 --> 18:46.925
your interest levels.

18:46.992 --> 18:49.561
So, Chris is talking to me,
and I mean,

18:49.628 --> 18:52.431
I hadn't really had a chance to
have a one-on-one with him,

18:52.498 --> 18:54.967
like a deep conversation
with him until right now.

18:55.033 --> 18:56.902
I'm just...

18:56.969 --> 19:00.405
sitting here a little
bit confused.

19:00.472 --> 19:01.640
I...

19:01.707 --> 19:03.142
You're kind of throwing me
off guard here.

19:03.208 --> 19:04.409
I didn't think that
you even had-

19:04.476 --> 19:05.677
That's fine.

19:05.744 --> 19:09.681
...any, you know, feelings or,
or thoughts about me in any way.

19:09.748 --> 19:11.016
I thought it was always
like, you know,

19:11.083 --> 19:12.885
Caitlin or Stacy or whatnot.

19:12.951 --> 19:15.120
You, you understand the
difference between like,

19:15.187 --> 19:17.055
like heart and head.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.794
- Drink?
- Let's go back to the bar.

19:22.861 --> 19:23.862
Let's go have a drink.

19:23.929 --> 19:25.998
If you wanna explore
anything further with me...

19:26.064 --> 19:28.066
- I'll come get you.
- Come get me, alright?

19:28.133 --> 19:30.502
Okay.

19:30.569 --> 19:34.773
Chris, at this point, is just
throwing a hook in the water

19:34.840 --> 19:36.542
and waiting for,
waiting for a bite,

19:36.608 --> 19:38.544
but he's got no bait
on that hook.

19:40.812 --> 19:43.615
I just...

19:43.682 --> 19:45.183
Wow!

19:45.250 --> 19:46.919
Chris is prepping shit
for everyone?

19:46.985 --> 19:50.622
I love it! Making it,
chop the pillow!

19:50.689 --> 19:51.924
Chop the middle!

19:51.990 --> 19:53.158
He tied his hair up
and he's like,

19:53.225 --> 19:55.027
look cute for the new girl.

19:55.093 --> 19:59.698
That is thoughtful,
is what that is.

19:59.765 --> 20:02.067
I'm not expecting another
guy to walk down the dock.

20:02.134 --> 20:04.169
There's already
been 3 this week.

20:04.236 --> 20:09.074
Imagine it's a guy!

20:09.141 --> 20:10.742
- Y'all, someone's here.
- No.

20:10.809 --> 20:14.212
- Oh, my God!
- What the [beep]!

20:19.851 --> 20:21.186
He tied his hair up
and he's like,

20:21.253 --> 20:23.188
look cute for the new girl.

20:23.255 --> 20:26.258
That is thoughtful,
is what that is.

20:26.325 --> 20:29.261
Imagine it's a guy!

20:34.066 --> 20:36.134
- Y'all, someone's here.
- No.

20:36.201 --> 20:37.903
Oh, my God!

20:37.970 --> 20:39.805
What's going on?

20:39.871 --> 20:41.306
What the [beep]!
There's a guy!

20:41.373 --> 20:43.075
Burn the Speedo,
burn the Speedo!

20:43.141 --> 20:45.143
- [Beep]!
- Burn the Speedo!

20:45.210 --> 20:46.778
- Hey, everybody!
- How you doing?

20:46.845 --> 20:47.646
How are ya?

20:47.713 --> 20:50.816
My name is Adam.
I am 28 years old and,

20:50.882 --> 20:52.584
I am a full-time firefighter.

20:52.651 --> 20:53.885
- Hey, how you doing, man?
- How you doing, man?

20:53.952 --> 20:55.220
I need some hugs.

20:55.287 --> 20:56.355
- Oh, bring it in, bring it in.
- I need some hugs.

20:56.421 --> 20:58.757
I honestly feel like I want to
do a backflip right now.

20:58.824 --> 21:00.325
I'm like, I'm so amped up.

21:00.392 --> 21:02.294
- Hey, Illeana.
- Illeana, pleasure.

21:02.361 --> 21:03.895
- Nice to meet you.
- Adam.

21:03.962 --> 21:06.164
Hi, I'm Lisa.
Nice to meet you.

21:06.231 --> 21:08.834
- Hi, I'm Kit.
- Hey, Kit, nice to meet you.

21:08.900 --> 21:10.002
- Nice to meet you too.
- Adam.

21:10.068 --> 21:12.337
Paradise, I am coming in hot.

21:12.404 --> 21:14.139
- Chris, Adam.
- Chris?

21:14.206 --> 21:16.942
Nice to meet you, bro,
Adam.

21:17.009 --> 21:18.744
[Beep]!

21:18.810 --> 21:22.714
I'm immediately stressed out.
I'm frustrated.

21:22.781 --> 21:25.317
I thought I had everything
figured out, but...

21:25.384 --> 21:28.086
I am completely lost as to
what's going to happen.

21:28.153 --> 21:30.756
This week, 4 guys
are going home.

21:30.822 --> 21:32.024
It's not okay.

21:32.090 --> 21:33.825
I feel like I'm
definitely in that mix.

21:33.892 --> 21:36.862
[Beep]!

21:36.928 --> 21:39.364
- A round of shots maybe?
- Let's do it.

21:39.431 --> 21:41.299
- Let's go!
- Yeah, I like this man.

21:41.366 --> 21:43.702
And then...
I'm gonna steal...

21:43.769 --> 21:45.704
one of you beautiful ladies
and we'll have a chat.

21:45.771 --> 21:48.674
Adam came in and he's like,
"Let's take a shot!"

21:48.740 --> 21:50.976
And like, the whole group
just follows him.

21:51.043 --> 21:52.644
Chris, can you come on?

21:52.711 --> 21:54.946
What is this dramatic
exit every time?

21:55.013 --> 21:57.316
I just don't know
what to do anymore.

21:57.382 --> 21:58.950
Boom.
Anybody else?

21:59.017 --> 22:01.953
Cheers to all of you guys,
and to Paradise.

22:02.020 --> 22:04.756
And, making some amazing new
friends and connections.

22:04.823 --> 22:07.826
And, yeah, having the time
of our lives. Cheers!

22:07.893 --> 22:10.328
- Cheers!
- Salut!

22:10.395 --> 22:11.396
Mm!

22:11.463 --> 22:12.464
Where are you finding these men?

22:12.531 --> 22:14.966
They're all very good
looking, attractive guys.

22:15.033 --> 22:17.269
I think Adam knows that
he's good looking.

22:17.336 --> 22:21.406
Okay, so,
"Find your queen".

22:21.473 --> 22:22.708
Oh!

22:22.774 --> 22:24.409
Adam's a super
good-looking dude.

22:24.476 --> 22:26.945
He made eye contact with me.
I, you know,

22:27.012 --> 22:29.347
was making sure that I was
dodging Kamil so I could

22:29.414 --> 22:31.750
keep making eye contact
with him because

22:31.817 --> 22:35.187
I wanted him to
pull me aside.

22:35.253 --> 22:37.689
- Caitlin, can I steal you a...
- Yeah, sounds good.

22:37.756 --> 22:41.426
Wanna go for a chat?
Go for a walk? Yeah.

22:41.493 --> 22:44.863
A new guy walks in. I'm not
gonna throw shade at him,

22:44.930 --> 22:47.199
but... he's wearing
a backwards hat.

22:47.265 --> 22:50.435
Maybe he's balding or he's
got a bad hairstyle so...

22:50.502 --> 22:54.272
You know, I'm not
really intimidated.

22:54.339 --> 22:56.708
Caitlin catches my attention
right off the bat.

22:56.775 --> 22:59.978
She's beautiful, has these
big, beautiful blue eyes.

23:00.045 --> 23:02.414
And, I just needed
to talk to her.

23:02.481 --> 23:04.316
We genuinely thought you
were gonna be a girl.

23:04.383 --> 23:05.183
- Really?
- Yeah.

23:05.250 --> 23:06.151
There's a lot of guys
here right now.

23:06.218 --> 23:08.286
There are a lot of guys here
right now, yeah.

23:08.353 --> 23:11.022
When is the next rose ceremony?
- We don't know yet.

23:11.089 --> 23:13.392
Honestly, don't for
a second think that

23:13.458 --> 23:14.426
you can predict
anything here.

23:14.493 --> 23:15.894
No, no, no, totally.

23:15.961 --> 23:18.230
Well, how do you feel
coming into all this?

23:18.296 --> 23:20.265
I am just super excited.

23:20.332 --> 23:22.300
I like really want to have
an amazing time and

23:22.367 --> 23:24.336
make some really
great connections.

23:24.403 --> 23:27.472
- How's it been so far?
- It's been alright.

23:27.539 --> 23:29.407
Like, we're getting to a point
where people are starting to

23:29.474 --> 23:31.410
link up with one another, and...

23:31.476 --> 23:33.979
there's just always
something that, like gets-

23:34.045 --> 23:36.047
- Comes in and just...
- Shakes it up a little bit.

23:36.114 --> 23:40.752
Shakes it up a little bit,
yeah. Yeah, like me.

23:40.819 --> 23:43.321
It is what it is at this moment.

23:43.388 --> 23:44.923
He's going for the wrong girls.

23:44.990 --> 23:46.892
Like, if he wants
to stay here...

23:46.958 --> 23:49.828
you should ask the men
who their connections

23:49.895 --> 23:53.198
are with first.
That's like basic bro code.

23:53.265 --> 23:55.333
There's only so many men
that can play on the court

23:55.400 --> 23:58.170
at one time. He's going
straight to the bench.

23:58.236 --> 24:00.105
And Illeana's next.
I call it right now.

24:00.172 --> 24:00.972
There you go.

24:01.039 --> 24:02.974
There's a lot of
us here.

24:03.041 --> 24:04.776
I get totally lost.

24:07.112 --> 24:09.347
Yeah.

24:09.414 --> 24:11.917
We definitely were expecting
you to be a woman.

24:11.983 --> 24:14.052
So, you're gonna spice
things up here.

24:14.119 --> 24:15.487
- I'm sure.
- I hope so.

24:15.554 --> 24:17.989
I hope so, that's the goal,
that's the plan.

24:18.056 --> 24:19.524
How long have you
been a fire fighter?

24:19.591 --> 24:22.294
I am in my 8th year right now.
What about you?

24:22.360 --> 24:23.461
What do you do back home?

24:23.528 --> 24:25.297
So, I'm a fitness model
in the city.

24:25.363 --> 24:27.532
And then,
a real estate agent.

24:27.599 --> 24:31.770
And I also just co-founded
an energy snack company

24:31.837 --> 24:32.871
with my best friend.

24:32.938 --> 24:34.840
Bad ass. I love that.

24:34.906 --> 24:36.541
Illeana is beautiful.

24:36.608 --> 24:40.111
I had an amazing connection
with her the entire time

24:40.178 --> 24:42.547
we talked and,
I didn't want it to end.

24:42.614 --> 24:46.785
The speed dating got in the
way, to be honest with you.

24:46.852 --> 24:49.855
He talked to Cait,
Illeana, and Vay.

24:49.921 --> 24:50.956
Have fun.

24:51.022 --> 24:53.258
Pick who you gotta pick and
have fun in Paradise.

24:53.325 --> 24:54.492
That's it!

24:54.559 --> 24:56.828
If he has game, I think the
best person to take right now

24:56.895 --> 24:58.430
is Caitlin. I think that
he can get it.

24:59.965 --> 25:01.800
Or Kit.

25:01.867 --> 25:03.802
I'm sure he does, you know,
he's charming.

25:03.869 --> 25:05.837
- I'm a model.
- Of course.

25:05.904 --> 25:07.372
That makes sense.

25:07.439 --> 25:08.507
Bro, we're all charming.

25:08.573 --> 25:09.875
He's gotta have
more than that.

25:09.941 --> 25:11.543
Every guy on this
beach is charming.

25:11.610 --> 25:13.812
Every guy?

25:13.879 --> 25:16.147
Okay, maybe not every guy,
but a majority of the guys.

25:16.214 --> 25:20.252
- Maybe not you, but...
-

25:20.318 --> 25:23.121
Yo, we do too much, bro.

25:27.292 --> 25:30.395
- We're gonna grill you.
- Oh, grill me, alright.

25:30.462 --> 25:32.097
- I dig it.
- Find out what's going on.

25:32.163 --> 25:34.599
- So, ah...
- Smooth sailing for now, but...

25:34.666 --> 25:35.867
Yeah.

25:35.934 --> 25:37.569
There's always a
storm brewing.

25:37.636 --> 25:40.171
There's people that have,
like, close relationships,

25:40.238 --> 25:41.473
right, already. So, like,

25:41.539 --> 25:43.475
it's hard on everyone
in different aspects.

25:43.541 --> 25:45.010
So, we know how you feel.

25:45.076 --> 25:46.311
Have you asked
someone on a date yet?

25:46.378 --> 25:48.380
Not yet. I'm gonna go ask
more people actually.

25:48.446 --> 25:49.447
It was a pleasure
meeting you guys.

25:49.514 --> 25:51.516
- Yeah, man, get it.
- Kamil, Brendan S., Chris.

25:51.583 --> 25:53.618
Hey, you got mine, there you go!
- See you guys in a bit.

25:53.685 --> 25:55.086
Don't feel bad if you
forget our names.

25:55.153 --> 25:57.522
I got you.
I got you, don't worry.

25:57.589 --> 25:59.524
He cut that short.

25:59.591 --> 26:00.592
- What's going on?
- How's it going?

26:00.659 --> 26:02.961
I'm good, I'm good. Jeremy,
I'm so sorry, brother.

26:03.028 --> 26:04.863
Is there any chance I could
interrupt for a second?

26:04.930 --> 26:06.131
Yeah, go ahead, man.
I appreciate it.

26:06.197 --> 26:06.932
I'll talk to
you later, okay?

26:07.032 --> 26:08.867
Okay, I'll tap
to you later. Ciao.

26:08.934 --> 26:11.436
Ciao. Hey!

26:11.503 --> 26:12.637
- What's going on?
- How's it going?

26:12.704 --> 26:14.039
- I'm good, I'm good.
- Good?

26:14.105 --> 26:16.274
- You having fun?
- I am having fun.

26:16.341 --> 26:17.242
5 minutes here,
10 minutes here.

26:17.309 --> 26:18.076
I've been through enough
of my speed dating.

26:18.143 --> 26:20.145
- I'm like, I'm good.
- You're good?

26:20.211 --> 26:22.147
Yeah, I was wondering
if you wanted to go

26:22.213 --> 26:23.315
on a date with me today?

26:23.381 --> 26:24.950
Yeah, that would be fun.
What did it say?

26:25.016 --> 26:26.084
What did the date card say?

26:26.151 --> 26:27.652
Ah, "find your queen",
I think?

26:27.719 --> 26:29.354
- Find your queen.
- So, so you're my queen.

26:29.421 --> 26:30.455
There you go, cheers.

26:30.522 --> 26:32.190
Bad luck, there's like
nothing in it.

26:32.257 --> 26:33.358
Yeah, that's dangerous.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.961
I never expected it
to be me, actually.

26:36.027 --> 26:39.197
So, surprise.

26:39.264 --> 26:41.166
- You were something special.
- Oh!

26:41.232 --> 26:44.102
I don't know, I just love the
energy that you have.

26:44.169 --> 26:45.637
Thanks!

26:45.704 --> 26:47.639
I'm so excited about
being able to spend

26:47.706 --> 26:49.507
some alone time
with Illeana.

26:49.574 --> 26:54.579
And, really explore where
our connection takes us.

26:54.646 --> 26:57.382
Alright, guys, we're heading
out for a date so,

26:57.449 --> 26:58.550
we'll see you later
tonight, okay?

26:58.616 --> 27:01.019
- Have fun!
- Cheers.

27:01.086 --> 27:03.121
- Have fun.
- There she goes...

27:03.188 --> 27:05.357
I'll talk with you later, okay?
- Yeah, babe.

27:05.423 --> 27:08.259
- Okay.
- Yeah, um...

27:08.326 --> 27:10.395
I mean, he's just trying to
shoot a shot coming in,

27:10.462 --> 27:13.098
trying to go for
the prettiest girl.

27:13.164 --> 27:15.367
It's not easy to see,
but Paradise,

27:15.433 --> 27:16.968
you kind of just have
to go with the flow.

27:17.035 --> 27:18.436
That's what makes it tough.

27:18.503 --> 27:21.206
What's this guy gonna
bring in one day?

27:21.272 --> 27:23.942
It's gotta be someone really
special in order

27:24.009 --> 27:25.477
to like shake
you up like that.

27:35.687 --> 27:38.189
What do we think Adam and
Illeana are doing on their date?

27:38.256 --> 27:40.458
What's the queen thing?
They're not playing chess.

27:40.525 --> 27:43.628
Let's flip this.
What do kings do?

27:43.695 --> 27:44.796
Jousting?

27:44.863 --> 27:47.599
Things change real quick in
Paradise, let me tell ya.

27:47.665 --> 27:49.667
It's shocking me
right now that Adam is

27:49.734 --> 27:51.503
taking Illeana on a date.

27:51.569 --> 27:53.405
I love that!

27:53.471 --> 27:56.141
́Cause I think Illeana does
need to explore and kind of get

27:56.207 --> 28:01.046
out of the box that she's
been put in by Brendan S.

28:01.112 --> 28:02.580
I hope it goes well.

28:02.647 --> 28:05.016
I think he's gonna try and
play it cool, but really,

28:05.083 --> 28:07.385
he's just waiting to see like...

28:07.452 --> 28:08.586
so, did you kiss.

28:08.653 --> 28:09.587
- He's gonna implode.
- Did you kiss?

28:09.654 --> 28:11.456
- Did you kiss, did you kiss?
- Oh, the kiss!

28:11.523 --> 28:13.391
- So, that's that's-
- I'll ask.

28:13.458 --> 28:15.527
Adam is a,
he's an attractive guy.

28:15.593 --> 28:19.664
He's got that radio voice.
He's a sexy firefighter man.

28:19.731 --> 28:21.666
There's a lot of firefighters.
That's a thing in Bachelor, ah?

28:21.733 --> 28:25.437
I'm also a firefighter.

28:25.503 --> 28:26.805
Astrid and I talked about
a guy coming in and

28:26.871 --> 28:27.739
taking Astrid on a date.

28:27.806 --> 28:28.807
I said, "Yeah, you can
go on a date,

28:28.873 --> 28:29.908
but I don't want you rolling
around in the sand,

28:29.974 --> 28:33.044
making out with him and then
come back to me and say,

28:33.111 --> 28:34.179
́I missed you'."

28:34.245 --> 28:36.247
- Right.
- That was my line.

28:36.314 --> 28:38.717
I think we said, experience
everything you can

28:38.783 --> 28:40.585
about Paradise,
but don't like...

28:40.652 --> 28:41.786
don't make a fool of me.
- Don't take it for granted.

28:41.853 --> 28:43.721
Don't make a fool of
me also, like if...

28:43.788 --> 28:45.190
I'm sure we'll have
a talk with, like,

28:45.256 --> 28:46.724
how the date went
and everything.

28:46.791 --> 28:48.593
She wanted to make sure
that you were okay

28:48.660 --> 28:50.729
before she went on
that date and...

28:50.795 --> 28:52.764
I don't think she's gonna come
back and, you know,

28:52.831 --> 28:55.600
have changed feelings about you.
- Yeah, that would be-

28:55.667 --> 28:58.436
It's not gonna be disappeared.
- That would be a big shift.

28:58.503 --> 29:00.438
- Yeah.
- And I don't want that, man.

29:00.505 --> 29:02.640
If that happens...
Kev, see you later.

29:02.707 --> 29:04.609
Couple shots and we'll
see you later, so...

29:11.750 --> 29:13.251
A bouncy house?

29:13.318 --> 29:15.186
Is that a king and
a queen outfit?

29:15.253 --> 29:17.222
What are we doing?

29:17.288 --> 29:19.357
Yeah, and like a bounce house?

29:19.424 --> 29:21.192
Alright, I think you need
to try on your crown.

29:21.259 --> 29:22.694
Oh, my God.

29:22.760 --> 29:24.529
I'm just excited to get to
know him better.

29:24.596 --> 29:26.498
If he kisses me,
I would be open to it.

29:26.564 --> 29:29.334
Also, that kiss would either
mean- If I really like it,

29:29.400 --> 29:31.703
like, I think
that's a bad sign.

29:31.769 --> 29:34.305
Or, I just, like, that
would let me know

29:34.372 --> 29:36.808
how I'm really feeling.
I think it will give me clarity.

29:36.875 --> 29:38.543
- Okay, let's see.
- This is top notch.

29:38.610 --> 29:40.678
- Wow. I mean...
- It fits.

29:40.745 --> 29:42.547
- Don't mess up the hair, eh?
- There you go.

29:42.614 --> 29:44.816
It's beautiful, it's beautiful.
It looks so good.

29:44.883 --> 29:48.186
My kingdom is a bouncy castle,
and my queen is...

29:48.253 --> 29:50.155
Illeana.

29:50.221 --> 29:51.055
We look...

29:51.122 --> 29:52.857
You look beautiful.
You look elegant.

29:52.924 --> 29:54.492
Yeah, you've gotta
zip me up though.

29:54.559 --> 29:56.361
The costumes are
hot as hell.

29:56.427 --> 29:58.530
I'm a sweaty girl.

29:58.596 --> 30:00.665
And it's 100
degrees outside.

30:00.732 --> 30:03.301
Perfect. With your
sideways crown, I love it.

30:03.368 --> 30:05.503
Okay,
yours is staying on.

30:05.570 --> 30:06.504
- Is it?
- Alright, we're ready.

30:06.571 --> 30:09.674
I mean, I just met this guy,
but it's not-

30:09.741 --> 30:11.543
It doesn't feel awkward, no.

30:13.278 --> 30:14.746
He's got not a
care in the world.

30:14.813 --> 30:17.715
He's just jumping up and
down like he's 12 years old.

30:17.782 --> 30:18.917
Did you ever as, like a kid,

30:18.983 --> 30:21.219
where you'd like jump
in, in the middle.

30:21.286 --> 30:23.421
- Oh, oh, yeah, and like-
- And do the double bounce.

30:23.488 --> 30:27.659
-
- Oh, God.

30:27.725 --> 30:30.728
1, 2, 3...

30:33.832 --> 30:35.800
This is like the best shot!

30:35.867 --> 30:38.536
You're kill,
you're killing it, yeah!

30:38.603 --> 30:40.371
- Yes!
- Get it, girl.

30:40.438 --> 30:44.609
Alright, your turn.
Oh, blue steel.

30:44.676 --> 30:46.644
Honestly, pulling out
the camera and

30:46.711 --> 30:48.613
capturing the moment was...

30:48.680 --> 30:51.182
the most spectacular part.
It was almost a window

30:51.249 --> 30:54.519
where I saw this camera and
I saw Illeana and,

30:54.586 --> 30:57.322
had her in my arms and I just,
I just wanted to kiss her.

30:57.388 --> 30:58.323
You see?
Can't see you,

30:58.389 --> 30:59.557
there you go,
there you go.

30:59.624 --> 31:01.359
- Oh, you look at the mirror?
- Yeah, yeah, through here.

31:01.426 --> 31:03.228
I know I'm really
attracted to him

31:03.294 --> 31:05.930
when he touches
my lower back.

31:05.997 --> 31:08.833
And, I got some
butterflies going.

31:08.900 --> 31:11.669
Like, some serious butterflies.

31:11.736 --> 31:13.771
- Okay.
- Look this way though.

31:23.448 --> 31:26.217
-
- I really like that one.

31:26.284 --> 31:27.952
- Yeah, it's kind of cute.
- This one looks ridiculous.

31:28.019 --> 31:29.954
Yeah, that one does.
That's the best one.

31:30.021 --> 31:32.557
I like that. Think we
can recreate that?

31:32.624 --> 31:34.459
Okay?

31:36.894 --> 31:39.631
1, 2, 3, hip...

31:39.697 --> 31:42.500
1, 2, 3, hips.

31:45.970 --> 31:47.605
What would you do

31:47.672 --> 31:50.008
if Illeana found a connection
with somebody else here?

31:50.074 --> 31:52.343
Well, if it was solidified
and she moved forward with

31:52.410 --> 31:53.978
somebody else, I probably
wouldn't stick around.

31:54.045 --> 31:55.546
But, do you feel like
at times that

31:55.613 --> 31:57.015
you can be a
little bit overbearing?

31:57.081 --> 31:59.784
Like I never see you guys like
hang out with anybody else.

31:59.851 --> 32:01.853
It feels like Brendan S.
is suffocating her

32:01.920 --> 32:05.256
in a way where she just
doesn't have freedom

32:05.323 --> 32:08.726
to be herself everywhere,
with everyone.

32:08.793 --> 32:10.728
My parents were never married,
separated when I was 3.

32:10.795 --> 32:13.598
Went home to home
my whole life. It sucked.

32:13.665 --> 32:16.701
Dealt with bullshit.
I never had a family dinner.

32:16.768 --> 32:19.404
Even if I was in relationships
with my girlfriend,

32:19.470 --> 32:20.672
her family's like, "Okay,
we're gonna set the table".

32:20.738 --> 32:21.839
I was like, "How do
you even do that?"

32:21.906 --> 32:23.741
́Cause I used to just eat on
the couch with my dad.

32:23.808 --> 32:25.443
And, that was just normal.

32:25.510 --> 32:29.681
I was very checked out of my
last relationship in the end

32:29.747 --> 32:32.650
because of my own personal
issues and struggles.

32:32.717 --> 32:35.820
But Illeana, she understands
that, and she just lets me be.

32:35.887 --> 32:37.388
That's when I knew
that that's the girl

32:37.455 --> 32:38.222
I just wanted to stick by.

32:38.323 --> 32:39.724
Once you step away,
it's like, man,

32:39.791 --> 32:40.825
I don't want that for my
family one day.

32:40.892 --> 32:42.894
I want to have a family dinner,
just like kicking back

32:42.961 --> 32:44.662
with beers and have
a BBQ with family.

32:44.729 --> 32:46.631
I didn't have that.

32:46.698 --> 32:47.732
This is the first
time Brendan S. and

32:47.799 --> 32:51.769
I have had a deeper
conversation.

32:51.836 --> 32:54.806
I feel like he wants to be in a
committed relationship,

32:54.872 --> 32:56.007
very badly.

32:56.074 --> 33:00.678
And I think that he feels
it'll help him to feel whole.

33:00.745 --> 33:03.648
But, then you're really
putting a lot of pressure on

33:03.715 --> 33:06.584
your counterpart and they're
gonna start to feel that.

33:06.651 --> 33:08.086
- I'm exhausted, man.
- For sure.

33:08.152 --> 33:09.587
Some days, you wake up,

33:09.654 --> 33:11.656
you kind of feel the
weight on top of you.

33:11.723 --> 33:15.560
I put on that, that happy face
all the time and...

33:15.626 --> 33:17.895
always have to be on, but..

33:17.962 --> 33:22.800
this is the first time like me
really feeling good again.

33:22.867 --> 33:24.736
Yeah.

33:27.472 --> 33:32.043
I don't want to fall back...

33:32.110 --> 33:33.711
in that hole.

33:50.795 --> 33:54.031
The boys are stressed right now.
I noticed Chris today, like...

33:54.098 --> 33:56.100
we all knew someone
was coming in,

33:56.167 --> 33:58.102
and I noticed him
like tie his hair up.

33:58.169 --> 34:00.838
Like, make sure he
looks good because, like,

34:00.905 --> 34:04.075
we all thought a girl was
coming in. And he was so-

34:04.142 --> 34:07.545
- I saw his reaction.
- ... Down when it was a guy.

34:07.612 --> 34:13.551
I felt my heart, like, I felt
for him. I felt so bad for him.

34:13.618 --> 34:16.020
I don't think Chris knows
what's going on with Chris.

34:16.087 --> 34:17.688
Like, I feel like Chris is
so lost right now that

34:17.755 --> 34:20.491
he's just like trying to
hang out with anybody.

34:20.558 --> 34:22.193
Lisa's gonna get
romantic tonight.

34:22.260 --> 34:24.962
- Mhm.
- So that's out.

34:25.029 --> 34:27.532
Unless she just
doesn't feel it.

34:27.598 --> 34:30.701
I'm feeling really frustrated
and a little defeated.

34:30.768 --> 34:32.837
Maybe you should have
pulled her into the hot tub.

34:32.904 --> 34:34.772
- I asked 3 times last night.
- Oh, really?

34:34.839 --> 34:38.509
Yeah. "Let's go
in the hot tub."

34:38.576 --> 34:41.079
Like I'm not, I'm not
ready to go home.

34:41.145 --> 34:43.748
Whatever.

34:43.815 --> 34:45.516
Well, I grew up
in a small town.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.452
And like, especially the
first school I went to,

34:47.518 --> 34:48.753
it was like a private school.

34:48.820 --> 34:49.921
And I really didn't like it
́cause I was like

34:49.987 --> 34:51.989
one of the only
minority in the-

34:52.056 --> 34:53.724
- Really?!
- Yeah, in my grade.

34:53.791 --> 34:55.693
It just sucks, like...
My biggest wish was that

34:55.760 --> 34:57.228
I was white when I
was in kindergarten.

34:57.295 --> 34:59.497
That makes me really sad that
any kid would feel that way.

34:59.564 --> 35:00.898
But now, these days, I'm
just like so comfortable in

35:00.965 --> 35:02.700
my own skin that just like,
it doesn't bother me.

35:02.767 --> 35:03.968
Like, even if I run
into that stuff, like,

35:04.035 --> 35:06.637
I don't let it ruin my day.

35:06.704 --> 35:08.172
I can't believe you
went through that.

35:08.239 --> 35:10.608
If you love yourself, like,
you can do so-

35:10.675 --> 35:12.477
like you could just do anything,
you know what I mean?

35:12.543 --> 35:13.578
Yeah.

35:13.644 --> 35:15.880
I believe Josh is
a genuine person,

35:15.947 --> 35:20.017
but I feel like I just need a
lot of signals before I ever

35:20.084 --> 35:21.719
make a move and
maybe in the past,

35:21.786 --> 35:24.055
I've relied on a guy to
pick up the reins.

35:24.121 --> 35:27.258
You know what, I am so
pleasantly surprised by you.

35:27.325 --> 35:30.194
Like, easily the first dude I
felt a connection with here.

35:30.261 --> 35:31.429
I feel like you're a
good person.

35:31.496 --> 35:33.631
- It's definitely somebody-
- No, but even outside this,

35:33.698 --> 35:35.833
I'm saying I would pursue
something with you.

35:35.900 --> 35:37.668
- Really?
- Yeah.

35:37.735 --> 35:39.537
- I'm saying that--
- I'll sit closer.

35:39.604 --> 35:42.240
I'm like, hm,
that's the cue to move over.

35:42.306 --> 35:44.942
I feel like I definitely have
a spark with Lisa.

35:45.009 --> 35:46.878
We're in the hot tub and,
obviously,

35:46.944 --> 35:51.182
things are getting a bit steamy.
I just want to see if...

35:51.249 --> 35:53.851
I kiss her right now, am I
gonna feel something?

36:04.729 --> 36:07.765
I walked past Josh and Lisa
and I heard her saying,

36:07.832 --> 36:10.968
"Are they gonna be all crazy
when they see that

36:11.035 --> 36:13.604
we made out on TV?"
And I was like, "What?"

36:13.671 --> 36:14.839
Wait, what?

36:14.906 --> 36:19.710
She's in the hot tub with
Josh right now.

36:19.777 --> 36:21.078
Tell me more about your family.

36:21.145 --> 36:22.813
- I only have a brother.
- Okay.

36:22.880 --> 36:25.016
- Older, younger?
- He's younger.

36:25.082 --> 36:27.585
- I think he's 25.
-

36:27.652 --> 36:29.186
- Is that bad?
- I mean...

36:29.253 --> 36:32.690
- He will always be 10 to me.
- Okay, okay, that's fair.

36:32.757 --> 36:36.294
As much as I hate to say it,
I definitely go for bros.

36:36.360 --> 36:38.663
I like a hockey boy,
I like a bro.

36:38.729 --> 36:39.931
I like a skater boy.

36:39.997 --> 36:42.033
I guess the common term
here would be boy.

36:42.099 --> 36:44.068
Alex is a man.

36:44.135 --> 36:46.637
And I think that as much as,
from someone on the outside

36:46.704 --> 36:49.774
looking in, it might not be
what they think I want,

36:49.840 --> 36:52.276
so maybe a man is what
I need in my life.

36:52.343 --> 36:53.844
I'd be very okay with
you kissing me

36:53.911 --> 36:55.846
if you'd like
to kiss me now.

37:08.025 --> 37:10.628
Here- oh!

37:10.695 --> 37:12.096
Where did it even go?

37:12.163 --> 37:14.131
I was gonna let you
do it, but...

37:14.198 --> 37:16.367
- Welcome to Paradise.
- Welcome to Paradise.

37:16.434 --> 37:19.604
I'm glad I got to take you
on this date.

37:19.670 --> 37:21.806
Yeah, I'm glad you did too.

37:21.872 --> 37:24.675
The first thing you came in, I
was like, he's got a nice smile.

37:24.742 --> 37:28.179
I was actually pretty surprised
when you asked me.

37:28.246 --> 37:31.616
When I saw you,
your eyes just popped.

37:31.682 --> 37:32.984
Your smile...

37:33.050 --> 37:34.619
you're just beautiful and
you have this like

37:34.685 --> 37:37.989
bubbly, amazing energy.

37:38.055 --> 37:40.958
She definitely gave me this
energy that felt like I was at

37:41.025 --> 37:44.362
home and able to really talk
about who I was and

37:44.428 --> 37:45.496
how I was feeling.

37:45.563 --> 37:47.932
Like, how did this come about?
How did you end up here?

37:47.999 --> 37:50.868
A couple crazy things happened
in my life a couple year ago.

37:50.935 --> 37:53.404
One of them,
I was actually engaged.

37:53.471 --> 37:54.338
I was supposed to be married.

37:54.405 --> 37:55.940
- Okay.
- Yeah.

37:56.007 --> 37:57.742
- That's pretty serious.
- Yeah, it was pretty serious.

37:57.808 --> 38:00.678
- How long ago was that?
- 2 and a half years ago now.

38:00.745 --> 38:04.782
It was very dark
for like months.

38:04.849 --> 38:08.786
But then on top of that, there
was like a tragic accident.

38:08.853 --> 38:11.722
A close friend of mine, he died
doing what he loved.

38:11.789 --> 38:14.925
And it, you know what, I try
and live my life now to live

38:14.992 --> 38:16.994
each day like it's your last
́cause you don't know.

38:17.061 --> 38:18.663
Right, you don't know
what's around the corner.

38:18.729 --> 38:21.799
And to like really enjoy
every moment.

38:21.866 --> 38:24.001
Yeah, well, I mean,
cheers to that.

38:24.068 --> 38:25.870
And thank you for
sharing that with me.

38:25.936 --> 38:29.874
He's answering me so
thoughtfully and honestly.

38:29.940 --> 38:32.743
The last time I had a
conversation with a guy

38:32.810 --> 38:36.047
like that, I, I don't
even remember.

38:36.113 --> 38:40.351
Especially a man I've
met moments ago.

38:40.418 --> 38:42.787
I was in a pretty serious
relationship, myself.

38:42.853 --> 38:45.756
5 years. And, we weren't
engaged or anything,

38:45.823 --> 38:48.159
but we lived together
for 4 years.

38:48.225 --> 38:49.360
Damn.

38:49.427 --> 38:52.263
Yeah, like, when I broke up
with him, I kind of like...

38:52.329 --> 38:54.432
just learning to love myself.

38:54.498 --> 38:57.735
I sort of like started to, you
know, journal every day.

38:57.802 --> 38:58.969
That was like really
important to me.

38:59.036 --> 39:02.139
So, like every day I write down
my 10 things I'm grateful for.

39:02.206 --> 39:03.340
That's so great.

39:03.407 --> 39:05.042
Literally, my days are
exactly the same.

39:05.109 --> 39:06.277
Like, I write a mission
statement,

39:06.344 --> 39:08.012
3 things I'm grateful for.

39:08.079 --> 39:10.915
3 goals for the day, and then
like a long-term goal.

39:10.981 --> 39:13.884
So many similarities, right?
Like, we wake up, we meditate.

39:13.951 --> 39:16.454
We write in our journal, we
say what we're grateful for.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.189
Fast forward down the line,
it's like,

39:18.255 --> 39:20.324
if you're trying to picture
a partner for yourself,

39:20.391 --> 39:23.160
it's like, you want to have
similar mindsets.

39:28.132 --> 39:30.067
I'm not being a But
I'm a catch, I know I am,

39:30.134 --> 39:32.103
and I'll do anything for
someone who I'm with.

39:32.169 --> 39:33.904
- Very simple.
- You're the man!

39:33.971 --> 39:36.807
- You're the best.
- You're the man.

39:36.874 --> 39:39.477
I got your back, too,
don't worry. If he come--

39:39.543 --> 39:40.678
Alright, this is what
I'm gonna do.

39:40.745 --> 39:42.780
If he comes in with the hat,
I'm just gonna flick it off.

39:42.847 --> 39:46.050
Stop, Kamil! Don't do
something like that.

39:46.117 --> 39:47.852
The hat on,
I'm just gonna-

39:47.918 --> 39:49.086
Kamil!

39:49.153 --> 39:51.455
He did exactly what anyone else
would do when they get here.

39:51.522 --> 39:53.357
He picked a girl and
went on a date.

39:53.424 --> 39:57.294
It just happened to be your
friend's girl, at this point.

39:57.361 --> 40:00.131
- And like, it's up to Illeana-
- My best friend's girl.

40:00.197 --> 40:01.932
Okay, but it's
up to Illeana.

40:01.999 --> 40:03.768
Like, she is a
grown ass woman,

40:03.834 --> 40:05.803
and she can make
decisions for herself.

40:05.870 --> 40:08.005
- Preach!
- And it's not up to you guys.

40:08.072 --> 40:12.443
I know that this night is gonna
be me playing middleman

40:12.510 --> 40:15.446
between Illeana
and Brendan S.

40:15.513 --> 40:19.049
And, Kamil is getting
heated about it as well.

40:19.116 --> 40:21.852
It has nothing to do with him.
So, that's like

40:21.919 --> 40:24.989
really starting to tick me
off ́cause he's like almost

40:25.055 --> 40:26.991
like pushed me
to the wayside.

40:27.057 --> 40:30.094
No matter what, it sucks.
Kami's the same way.

40:30.161 --> 40:31.395
No matter what,
seeing you get pulled-

40:31.462 --> 40:34.565
- I'm crazy.
- You're crazy?

40:34.632 --> 40:37.001
Good thing you're
not on a date.

40:37.067 --> 40:38.969
Seriously, it makes me
feel better.

40:39.036 --> 40:40.938
Yeah, I've got you.
You're okay.

40:41.005 --> 40:42.473
I know.

40:53.617 --> 40:58.022
♪ DRAWN INTO
THIS MYSTERY. ♪

40:58.088 --> 41:01.325
♪ ANOTHER SUNSET.

41:01.392 --> 41:05.362
♪ HEARTBEAT.

41:05.429 --> 41:09.934
♪ LET DARKNESS
WASH OVER ME. ♪

41:10.000 --> 41:12.436
♪ STARRY WONDER.

41:12.503 --> 41:17.341
Dancing under fairy lights.
Barefoot with a beautiful woman.

41:17.408 --> 41:19.376
Kissing her and...

41:19.443 --> 41:21.846
just feeling the music and
feeling the energy and

41:21.912 --> 41:23.147
feeling the vibes.

41:23.214 --> 41:24.849
It was straight out of
a story book.

41:24.915 --> 41:26.584
It was amazing.

41:35.426 --> 41:37.595
Dancing with Adam is fun.

41:37.661 --> 41:40.931
I mean, we're in the forest.
We're barefoot.

41:40.998 --> 41:43.968
I don't care that I'm a
sweaty mess and

41:44.034 --> 41:47.204
my feet are fricking
dirty as heck.

41:47.271 --> 41:50.407
We're just listening to the
music and in the moment.

41:50.474 --> 41:53.377
And, I think that's really
all I could ask of that.

42:04.121 --> 42:05.289
<i>Coming up...</i>

42:05.356 --> 42:07.157
Let's lay it all out.

42:07.224 --> 42:10.928
This is not the right place and
time to talk about a date.

42:10.995 --> 42:13.464
My blood is boiling.

42:13.530 --> 42:16.066
You could see the steam
boiling out of him.

42:16.133 --> 42:17.601
- What is going on with you?
- What do you mean?

42:17.668 --> 42:20.170
- Why are you acting like that?
- Because he's my best friend.

42:20.237 --> 42:23.274
I'm really confused right now,
and I'm not gonna lie to you.

42:23.340 --> 42:25.576
If he wants to talk to me
again, like, I will.

42:25.643 --> 42:26.911
- Hey.
- How you doing?

42:26.977 --> 42:28.112
Oh-ho-ho.

42:28.178 --> 42:29.413
This is the shit I was
talking about, man!

42:29.480 --> 42:30.514
This is the shit
I wanted to see!

42:30.581 --> 42:32.950
This is crazy!

42:37.788 --> 42:40.658
That was amazing, it was like...

42:40.724 --> 42:44.695
I think I might have to make
a pit stop over here.

42:44.762 --> 42:46.263
- Illeana!
- I might get a drink too.

42:46.330 --> 42:47.731
- Okay.
- Hey!

42:47.798 --> 42:49.400
- Hey, what's up, bro?
- Hey, gang.

42:49.466 --> 42:50.968
What can I get ya?

42:51.035 --> 42:52.636
- Hey.
- What's up, how are you?

42:52.703 --> 42:56.373
I feel a lot of pressure,
coming back from my date.

42:56.440 --> 42:58.976
I mean, Brendan S. is
sitting at the bar,

42:59.043 --> 43:00.511
staring at me.

43:00.577 --> 43:04.114
And I know he's just going
through his head,

43:04.181 --> 43:06.283
wondering what happened.

43:06.350 --> 43:07.985
- What'd you guys get up to?
- Yeah.

43:08.052 --> 43:11.655
We, honestly, went full
king and queen and

43:11.722 --> 43:13.390
went into a bouncy castle.

43:13.457 --> 43:15.592
So, you're king
of the castle?

43:15.659 --> 43:17.594
So, we bounced in
the bouncy house.

43:17.661 --> 43:21.498
And then afterwards, we had
some champagne and,

43:21.565 --> 43:24.668
sat on the sofa in the woods
with, like, twinkle lights.

43:24.735 --> 43:27.638
Yeah, I mean, I think there
was more to it than-

43:27.705 --> 43:31.608
Oh, there's more to it.
Tell me.

43:31.675 --> 43:33.277
Let's lay it all out.

43:33.344 --> 43:35.312
- Kamil!
- Kamil...

43:37.715 --> 43:41.151
This is not the right place
and time to talk about a date

43:41.218 --> 43:46.023
when her true man is
standing side by side.

43:46.090 --> 43:49.093
My blood is boiling.

43:49.159 --> 43:53.330
You could see the steam
boiling out of him.

43:53.397 --> 43:54.632
I could just see, like,

43:54.698 --> 43:57.034
everything going through
his head in that moment,

43:57.101 --> 43:59.036
and it wasn't gonna be nice.

43:59.103 --> 44:02.506
- Don't say anything, Kamil.
- I'm not, relax.

44:02.573 --> 44:05.175
- Thank you, Kevin.
- Okay, I gotta take ya.

44:05.242 --> 44:06.810
Yeah, let's go.

44:06.877 --> 44:09.613
Maybe we should walk this way.

44:15.652 --> 44:16.653
Hey.

44:16.720 --> 44:17.655
- What is going on with you?
- What do you mean?

44:17.721 --> 44:19.690
Why are you getting so
stressed out about it?

44:19.757 --> 44:21.291
I'm not! Because he's
my best friend.

44:21.358 --> 44:23.727
Yeah, I know, but like,
he can handle himself.

44:23.794 --> 44:25.496
He's a big boy.

44:25.562 --> 44:27.331
I know he could
handle himself.

44:27.398 --> 44:29.133
He didn't take me
out on a date.

44:29.199 --> 44:30.668
So, what is your concern?

44:30.734 --> 44:33.170
I'm just annoyed with
how much, like,

44:33.237 --> 44:36.473
emotional tension Kamil is
paying to this whole

44:36.540 --> 44:39.309
Adam, Brendan S.,
Illeana thing.

44:39.376 --> 44:42.846
Like, I'm sitting right here.
What's wrong with me?

44:42.913 --> 44:44.815
- Let them figure it out.
- I know, but like-

44:44.882 --> 44:47.584
- It's for them to figure out.
- Exactly, exactly.

44:47.651 --> 44:51.188
Like, I'm just, Brendan's
my best friend here and,

44:51.255 --> 44:53.557
I really care about him, and I
want him to be happy.

44:53.624 --> 44:56.460
Tonight, I'm seeing some
red flags with Kamil.

44:56.527 --> 45:00.497
I don't like how he handled
the new guy coming in.

45:00.564 --> 45:05.202
I don't like how he stood in
front of me and claimed me.

45:05.269 --> 45:07.738
I feel like I'm more stressed
out about it than he is.

45:10.474 --> 45:11.708
Today was a tough day
for me, overall,

45:11.775 --> 45:14.778
but I don't know
where you're at.

45:14.845 --> 45:18.549
I wasn't expecting him to
give me the date card.

45:18.615 --> 45:21.852
It was a fun date.
I think he's a good person.

45:21.919 --> 45:24.722
We did kiss, I want you
to know that.

45:24.788 --> 45:28.726
Before anyone
else tells you.

45:28.792 --> 45:31.562
He kissed me.
I kissed him back.

45:34.965 --> 45:37.735
You know, I was hoping that you
would come back and be like,

45:37.801 --> 45:40.204
"Yeah, I understand,"
you know, I'm-

45:40.270 --> 45:41.438
Listen, I'm confident about-

45:41.505 --> 45:42.773
I'm really
confused right now,

45:42.840 --> 45:44.608
and I'm not
gonna lie to you.

45:44.675 --> 45:46.744
If he wants to talk to me
again, like, I will.

45:46.810 --> 45:48.445
Because if anything,
it's just gonna solidify

45:48.512 --> 45:49.713
how we feel
towards each other.

45:49.780 --> 45:52.549
But by shutting ourselves off,
I don't want to leave here and

45:52.616 --> 45:54.651
be like, I regret not having
the opportunity to

45:54.718 --> 45:56.253
speak to someone else.

45:56.320 --> 45:58.422
You know no one comes over
to me because we're always

45:58.489 --> 46:00.657
together, and people are afraid
to come over to me,

46:00.724 --> 46:03.327
it seems. I was surprised
when he came over.

46:03.393 --> 46:04.895
Like, I was shocked.

46:04.962 --> 46:07.397
So, like, going into week two.
- Yeah.

46:07.464 --> 46:08.365
It's all gonna be
girls coming in.

46:08.432 --> 46:11.201
Yeah! And I think you
should talk to them.

46:11.268 --> 46:14.204
But like, you're gonna feel
okay with one-on-one dates?

46:14.271 --> 46:16.240
You can be curious about
another person and

46:16.306 --> 46:17.407
still like me.

46:17.474 --> 46:20.344
I just can't give my heart
and energy out because like,

46:20.410 --> 46:21.879
I found
the person that...

46:21.945 --> 46:25.949
makes me feel safe.

46:26.016 --> 46:29.720
Moving forward,
any other dates going on,

46:29.786 --> 46:33.724
I don't want you rolling
around in the sand and

46:33.791 --> 46:35.793
kissing someone and coming
back and saying you miss me.

46:35.859 --> 46:38.862
And like, I don't put up
with that bullshit.

46:38.929 --> 46:42.266
If Illeana doesn't choose me,
I'm just gonna leave.

46:42.332 --> 46:47.538
I am skeptical to set, like,
rules and limitations

46:47.604 --> 46:50.474
on each other, like,
from so early on.

46:50.541 --> 46:54.878
See, like, for me, I'll open
up to who has my heart,

46:54.945 --> 46:59.783
but I'm the first one to leave
if like, it's too tough.

46:59.850 --> 47:03.887
It doesn't matter
what I say.

47:03.954 --> 47:06.256
It doesn't matter,
he's still like-

47:06.323 --> 47:08.458
I don't think maybe gets it.

47:11.695 --> 47:14.231
I'm scared.
I'm really scared.

47:19.369 --> 47:21.471
Hey, cheers.

47:21.538 --> 47:22.906
- What's up, buddy.
- Cheers.

47:22.973 --> 47:25.876
- Excuse me, guys.
- Yeah, absolutley.

47:25.943 --> 47:27.344
- Hey.
- How you doing?

47:27.411 --> 47:28.645
Oh-ho-ho.

47:28.712 --> 47:30.414
I am doing well.
How are you doing?

47:30.480 --> 47:31.648
- I'm good.
- Yeah?

47:31.715 --> 47:33.317
Did you have any chats?

47:36.453 --> 47:38.355
Illeana's been talking
to Brendan S.

47:38.422 --> 47:40.724
for however long,
20 minutes, 30 minutes.

47:40.791 --> 47:44.328
And, I see her come back and,
within 5 seconds of

47:44.394 --> 47:47.331
them separating, I'm on her.

47:47.397 --> 47:49.366
And I want to keep talking
to her and I want to

47:49.433 --> 47:51.802
continue the rest
of our night.

47:51.869 --> 47:54.638
What the doubel 'H-E'
hockey sticks...

47:54.705 --> 47:58.408
- Oh, he did it!
- ...is going on?

47:58.475 --> 48:01.945
- So, they went on a date.
- And still on a date.

48:02.012 --> 48:04.882
From minute two 'til hour 5
they were just making out.

48:04.948 --> 48:06.450
- They stopped-
- Those two?

48:06.516 --> 48:07.417
For the whole time.

48:07.484 --> 48:08.986
This is the shit I was
talking about, man!

48:09.052 --> 48:12.322
This is the shit I wanted
to see!

48:12.389 --> 48:13.824
They connected really well.

48:13.891 --> 48:15.492
I talked to him for a bit,
he's a fireman.

48:15.559 --> 48:17.694
So, me and him clicked
pretty quick. He just said,

48:17.761 --> 48:19.696
"I'm not gonna ask someone
just ́cause they're single.

48:19.763 --> 48:21.832
I'm gonna ask who I want to
go after." I respect that,

48:21.898 --> 48:25.002
especially here. He said
they clicked pretty quick.

48:25.068 --> 48:26.737
This is crazy!

48:26.803 --> 48:28.538
I didn't think
he was gonna take it!

48:28.605 --> 48:29.873
Agh!

48:29.940 --> 48:32.376
I just thought that she'd
be too nervous to...

48:32.442 --> 48:33.610
flutter things up.

48:33.677 --> 48:35.479
Do what you want to do,
that's it.

48:35.545 --> 48:36.546
Yeah.

48:36.613 --> 48:37.881
You know what,
right when you think

48:37.948 --> 48:39.483
you've got things
figured out.

48:39.549 --> 48:40.984
No, it was great.
Like, honestly.

48:41.051 --> 48:42.319
- Yeah.
- And have you-

48:42.386 --> 48:43.520
- Oh, oh.
- Hey, guys!

48:43.587 --> 48:46.456
- Hey!
- Oh, my God, why is Jeremy-

48:46.523 --> 48:47.891
He's meditating.

48:47.958 --> 48:49.459
What's going on here?

48:49.526 --> 48:52.095
Wait, wait, wait.
How was your date?

48:52.162 --> 48:53.463
It was amazing.

48:53.530 --> 48:56.366
I'm that girl.
Was there a kiss?

48:56.433 --> 49:00.003
There, there was.
There was... yeah.

49:01.738 --> 49:06.510
Will there be...
another kiss.

49:06.576 --> 49:09.479
I hope so. Ah...

49:09.546 --> 49:13.850
TBD. I got a lot of things
to work out over here.

49:13.917 --> 49:16.386
Dude, apparently, they made out
the whole time.

49:16.453 --> 49:17.321
You're shitting me
right now.

49:17.387 --> 49:18.722
I'm not. No, no,
dude, dude. I'm like-

49:18.789 --> 49:22.125
- Where's Brendan?
- Like! I don't know!

49:22.192 --> 49:23.460
I don't know
what's going on!

49:23.527 --> 49:25.529
Everyone needs to calm down.

49:25.595 --> 49:29.066
The sweaty part was
really great.

49:29.132 --> 49:30.534
- Illeana?
- Yeah?

49:30.600 --> 49:33.036
- Do you want to go chat?
- Yeah. Girl chat.

49:33.103 --> 49:36.073
Alright, I'll see you in a bit.
- Alright, I'll see you.

49:36.139 --> 49:37.808
- Oh, my God.
- Okay.

49:37.874 --> 49:40.677
Oh, God, okay, wait.
Start from the beginning.

49:40.744 --> 49:42.512
I just walked to the bar
and they were like,

49:42.579 --> 49:44.648
"They made- they were just
making out the whole time."

49:44.715 --> 49:46.950
- Who said that?
- That's what Chris said.

49:47.017 --> 49:49.753
I mean, the thing is, at the
end of the day, like, the...

49:49.820 --> 49:51.855
the kiss was really good.

49:51.922 --> 49:53.724
Fire?

49:53.790 --> 49:57.661
Not to say that my
kisses with Brendan S.

49:57.728 --> 50:00.597
aren't good,
they're just different.

50:00.664 --> 50:01.698
Like...

50:01.765 --> 50:06.770
Adam is a little bit more
gentle and like, tender.

50:06.837 --> 50:10.073
And, Brendan S. is...

50:10.140 --> 50:11.942
a bit more intense.

50:12.009 --> 50:15.112
I guess they, they kiss
the way they date.

50:15.178 --> 50:17.514
So, I've had 7 days
with Brendan S.,

50:17.581 --> 50:20.784
and it's been wonderful, and we
have a really strong connection.

50:20.851 --> 50:25.722
But, after like one
day with Adam...

50:25.789 --> 50:28.825
it was like a lot deeper.

50:28.892 --> 50:30.894
No one was expecting me,
I think, to come back

50:30.961 --> 50:34.431
and be like, "Oh, that
actually went really well."

50:34.498 --> 50:36.533
You just have to
follow your heart.

50:39.136 --> 50:41.004
Is a kiss gonna mean
something as special as

50:41.071 --> 50:42.839
what we've shared
the last week?

50:42.906 --> 50:44.207
- Probably not.
- Probably not.

50:44.274 --> 50:48.578
I'm pissed off. Especially
with the effort I put in.

50:48.645 --> 50:50.147
No, it is tough.
Like, that's why I walked away

50:50.213 --> 50:52.783
from when he came in after
the date with Illeana.

50:52.849 --> 50:54.718
Like, and he talked
about it, like-

50:54.785 --> 50:56.720
- What's he saying?
- In your position.

50:56.787 --> 50:58.722
No, like he had a good time
or whatever and

50:58.789 --> 51:00.957
you were standing there
with Illeana and...

51:01.024 --> 51:03.627
and then like, and then he said
there was some more.

51:03.693 --> 51:05.061
And I'm like, so,
what more was it?

51:05.128 --> 51:07.197
Like, just lay it out.
We're at the bar, like...

51:07.264 --> 51:08.899
lay it out.
And he's like, yeah, no.

51:08.965 --> 51:11.234
That had my blood boiling, and
I wasn't even you, man.

51:11.301 --> 51:13.804
Like, I can only
imagine how you felt.

51:13.870 --> 51:17.541
If Brendan and Illeana had a
strong relationship as

51:17.607 --> 51:19.976
it looks, like, she wouldn't
go on a date.

51:20.043 --> 51:21.178
She could've said no.

51:21.244 --> 51:24.781
Or she could have went on the
date and had an okay time,

51:24.848 --> 51:26.483
but like, the whole
kissing part,

51:26.550 --> 51:28.485
I feel like that could
have been avoided.

51:28.552 --> 51:30.620
I told her I don't
want to feel like

51:30.687 --> 51:32.789
I'm getting taken
for granted.

51:32.856 --> 51:35.125
The foundations that you've
laid with Illeana are-

51:35.192 --> 51:36.726
- Are strong.
- Are so, so strong.

51:36.793 --> 51:38.195
Dude, they're so solid.

51:38.261 --> 51:40.764
If this is what you have to go
through to end up with her?

51:40.831 --> 51:43.166
Why do you think I'm trying
to just bite my tongue?

51:43.233 --> 51:44.734
I know, I know.

51:44.801 --> 51:49.172
Illeana and I have grown
so much together.

51:49.239 --> 51:50.941
The reason why it sucks
is because like,

51:51.007 --> 51:55.245
this is a girl that I can leave
Paradise tomorrow with.

51:55.312 --> 51:57.180
I know what I want,
and I'm very stubborn

51:57.247 --> 51:58.081
when it comes to that.

51:58.148 --> 52:01.585
And, don't take me
for granted, really.

52:01.651 --> 52:03.887
And even Kamil was
getting fired up. And like,

52:03.954 --> 52:06.890
I'm having to talk Kamil
off a damn ledge right now?

52:06.957 --> 52:11.528
Brendan and Illeana are adults.
Like, you have me right here.

52:11.595 --> 52:14.264
God forbid I went on this date,
like, I couldn't even imagine.

52:14.331 --> 52:15.765
Oh, yeah.

52:15.832 --> 52:17.300
It's been a lot, if I'm
being honest.

52:17.367 --> 52:19.836
They're both just being
ultimate tools right now,

52:19.903 --> 52:21.538
to be honest.

52:21.605 --> 52:24.541
I feel like I've been like this
like emotional like...

52:24.608 --> 52:26.243
support for Brendan.

52:26.309 --> 52:28.712
And like, I care
about him a lot.

52:28.778 --> 52:30.947
I'm broken for him
in this moment,

52:31.014 --> 52:33.283
but I'm happy for you
in this moment, too.

52:33.350 --> 52:35.585
It's like... it's a lot.

52:35.652 --> 52:37.821
I feel like I'm like...

52:37.888 --> 52:41.658
I'm expected to feel
everything for Brendan S.

52:41.725 --> 52:45.729
I'm expected to manage Kamil.

52:45.795 --> 52:49.332
I'm expected to like play this
middleman between Illeana,

52:49.399 --> 52:52.736
my friend, and Brendan S.,
my other friend.

52:52.802 --> 52:58.241
And it's like, like...
what's left for me?

52:58.308 --> 53:01.344
The thought of even like
ever hurting Brendan-

53:01.411 --> 53:05.081
Yeah, and that just shows that
your feelings for him are real.

53:05.148 --> 53:06.883
I don't want to,
like, hurt Kamil.

53:06.950 --> 53:11.054
Like, if I was to go on a date,
if you don't explore that,

53:11.121 --> 53:13.657
like, you could be
hurting yourself.

53:13.723 --> 53:17.060
Ultimately, you have
to be there for you.

53:17.127 --> 53:20.931
The thought of hurting
Brendan S., honestly, kills me.

53:20.997 --> 53:22.832
In a situation
like this, right,

53:22.899 --> 53:24.768
it's inevitable that
someone gets hurt.

53:24.834 --> 53:26.836
It's just like,
who is that person?

53:34.778 --> 53:36.179
What we've
been waiting for.

53:36.246 --> 53:38.081
Hello, hello!

53:38.148 --> 53:40.750
- Good morning.
- How are you?

53:40.817 --> 53:41.918
I'm good.

53:41.985 --> 53:45.855
Hey... hi.
I missed you.

53:45.922 --> 53:50.293
I think today is gonna be me
going here, here, here...

53:50.360 --> 53:53.063
- Can you do that?
- For you? If you want.

53:53.129 --> 53:56.166
Yeah. And just know, like,
he's gonna talk to me today.

53:56.233 --> 53:57.801
To a new day.

54:01.338 --> 54:05.475
I am not devoting any more
emotional resources

54:05.542 --> 54:07.510
to the Brendan S.
and Illeana thing.

54:07.577 --> 54:09.813
Like, ultimately, I have the
power this week and

54:09.879 --> 54:13.183
here I am like feeling
helpless.

54:13.250 --> 54:17.087
- Better?
- Ah... not really.

54:17.153 --> 54:20.357
Seeing Caitlin, she didn't
look herself this morning.

54:20.423 --> 54:25.862
I could notice like a
sense of doubtfulness.

54:25.929 --> 54:29.232
Guys! I got a card!
Everybody!

54:29.299 --> 54:32.135
- Oh!
- Alright, so you ready?

54:32.202 --> 54:34.938
I'm gonna read this.

54:35.005 --> 54:36.873
- "Joey."
- What'd I do?

54:36.940 --> 54:39.476
"This is a date card
with a twist.

54:39.542 --> 54:43.813
It's up to you to choose two
campers that you believe

54:43.880 --> 54:46.916
deserve some quality
time together.

54:46.983 --> 54:50.053
Campers, if you are
dying for a date,

54:50.120 --> 54:53.923
it's up to you to
make your case.

54:53.990 --> 54:56.826
Joey, you have
the power, baby."

54:56.893 --> 54:58.528
- Yes, I do! Okay!
- "Use it wisely."

54:58.595 --> 55:00.897
- "Use it wisely!"
- Wow!

55:00.964 --> 55:02.132
You know you're a good
looking cowboy, but come on!

55:02.198 --> 55:04.234
Really, apparently, you're the
better-looking cowboy, so...

55:04.300 --> 55:05.435
Oh!

55:05.502 --> 55:07.804
I got a little bit of power
here with this date card and

55:07.871 --> 55:10.140
I'm looking forward to
seeing what happens.

55:10.206 --> 55:12.809
- Oh, wow.
- There you go, bud.

55:12.876 --> 55:15.378
It's been a lot of
stress on me lately.

55:15.445 --> 55:17.847
But if we take this
to the next level...

55:17.914 --> 55:19.416
So, are you trying to get me
to have a date with you?

55:19.482 --> 55:20.950
I want to play cupid,
if you will.

55:21.017 --> 55:22.352
A little matchmaking action.

55:22.419 --> 55:24.821
You talk to Brendan.
I'll freshen your drink for you.

55:24.888 --> 55:26.089
What can I get for you, sir?

55:26.156 --> 55:29.125
I don't know, I just, I just...
I really like this girl, man.

55:29.192 --> 55:31.127
May I have a gin-
whatever Joey drinks.

55:31.194 --> 55:32.062
Gin and soda?

55:32.128 --> 55:33.363
I mean, I'll like her too
a lot more when

55:33.430 --> 55:34.831
she comes back
with that drink.

55:36.433 --> 55:39.469
I haven't had a chance to get
to know Vay very well, so...

55:39.536 --> 55:40.570
It's not gonna happen.

55:40.637 --> 55:45.175
Why would I ever send you on
a date, Chris, with Vay?

55:45.241 --> 55:47.477
I just... literally,
at this point,

55:47.544 --> 55:50.313
that would just be cruel
and unusual punishment.

55:50.380 --> 55:53.550
He should be worried because
I think he's a clown.

55:53.616 --> 55:59.022
And I think Vay is way better
than him. She deserves better.

55:59.089 --> 56:00.223
- Second option.
- Okay.

56:00.290 --> 56:02.292
You see these two
people walking by?

56:02.358 --> 56:03.460
Yeah.

56:03.526 --> 56:06.329
I don't like looking at
them together.

56:06.396 --> 56:08.898
- So, I want them off my beach.
- Gotcha.

56:08.965 --> 56:10.533
I thought he was
buddies with Kamil,

56:10.600 --> 56:12.068
but he tells me he's
sick of seeing them

56:12.135 --> 56:14.904
on the beach together.
I, I can't with this guy.

56:14.971 --> 56:16.206
He just, I swear,

56:16.272 --> 56:18.274
he's gonna try to pick up
the camera women next.

56:22.011 --> 56:25.081
Last night, you two...

56:25.148 --> 56:28.451
put a lot of
pressure on Caitlin.

56:28.518 --> 56:31.454
It feels like Brendan does
do these things for me and,

56:31.521 --> 56:35.091
who's doing the special
things to make Caitlin feel

56:35.158 --> 56:37.494
recognized and
seen and special?

56:37.560 --> 56:40.196
Don't, don't put me in that
position that I'm not showing

56:40.263 --> 56:42.232
her that I don't feel that
she's special for me.

56:42.298 --> 56:45.969
Like, I don't, I don't
like that, Illeana.

56:46.035 --> 56:48.638
I only have so much.

56:48.705 --> 56:51.975
And last night I felt like
there just wasn't

56:52.041 --> 56:54.210
much left for me anymore.

56:54.277 --> 56:57.247
́Cause I was there
for everyone else.

56:57.313 --> 57:00.617
She's felt very like,
unwanted.

57:00.683 --> 57:02.018
She was kind of
sad that like

57:02.085 --> 57:02.919
she didn't get the
date yesterday.

57:02.986 --> 57:04.120
I think she thought
she was going to.

57:04.187 --> 57:07.490
She's been wanting a date,
and like, Kamil hasn't set up,

57:07.557 --> 57:08.958
like- even if you don't
get a date card, like,

57:09.025 --> 57:11.161
you can still set
something up, like,

57:11.227 --> 57:12.195
you know what
I mean, like...

57:12.262 --> 57:13.930
Mhm, mhm.

57:16.566 --> 57:18.535
- What's up?
- How you feeling?

57:18.601 --> 57:20.136
- Ah, I'm alright.
- Yeah, that was...

57:20.203 --> 57:23.339
- I'm a little confused today.
- Are ya?

57:23.406 --> 57:25.408
Got a lot going on, yeah.

57:25.475 --> 57:28.211
Okay, well, I don't want to
just put the pressure on you,

57:28.278 --> 57:30.713
but I'm gonna cut
straight to the point.

57:30.780 --> 57:33.183
If I chose you to go on a date
with someone else, would you go?

57:33.249 --> 57:36.052
- With someone else?
- Not Kamil.

57:36.119 --> 57:40.223
- Yes.
- Adam?

57:40.290 --> 57:41.958
Yeah, I would be down.

57:42.025 --> 57:45.228
I was super excited that he
pulled me aside first yesterday.

57:45.295 --> 57:47.530
I think everyone's starting
to have those moments

57:47.597 --> 57:49.432
of clarity with
their person.

57:49.499 --> 57:51.334
For me, it kind of
pushed me, like,

57:51.401 --> 57:53.536
in the opposite way yesterday.

57:53.603 --> 57:56.039
I'm talking to a lot of
people right now.

57:56.105 --> 57:58.608
I'm going down the list.
Pressure's starting to mount.

57:58.675 --> 58:00.343
I'm starting to
get stressed.

58:00.410 --> 58:02.078
Like, thank God people are
bringing me drinks

58:02.145 --> 58:04.714
right now because, wow.

58:04.781 --> 58:08.718
A new guitar for your birthday.
Calgary Stampede tickets.

58:08.785 --> 58:10.553
Whoa-ho, buddy! He knows
the way to my heart!

58:10.620 --> 58:12.622
Busting it all out there, bro.
I got you.

58:12.689 --> 58:15.391
Okay, well what, ah...
what do you want?

58:15.458 --> 58:17.727
Ah, I would love...

58:17.794 --> 58:20.463
some more time with Illeana.

58:20.530 --> 58:22.298
I think it's so important
for me to have

58:22.365 --> 58:26.569
another date with Illeana.
She has this other pressure and

58:26.636 --> 58:29.739
shadow behind her and I want
to take her away from that.

58:29.806 --> 58:32.709
If I'm really invested and
interested in something,

58:32.775 --> 58:34.544
I'm gonna go for it and
I'm gonna get it.

58:34.611 --> 58:37.080
I haven't had yet any time.

58:37.146 --> 58:40.016
I have to like, I have to
like totally capitalize.

58:40.083 --> 58:41.351
Like, this would be huge, bro.

58:41.417 --> 58:43.720
We're getting down to the
nitty gritty here and,

58:43.786 --> 58:47.757
he wants to take Illeana.
I gotta talk to my first lady.

58:47.824 --> 58:50.727
I need the queen of Paradise to
come in here and have a chat.

58:50.793 --> 58:52.528
This was fun and now
I'm stressing.

58:52.595 --> 58:54.464
You're not gonna pick
two people that have

58:54.530 --> 58:56.466
just gone on a
date together.

58:56.532 --> 58:58.401
Maybe you should just give it
to Chris and, you know,

58:58.468 --> 59:01.070
he can take me on a date.

59:02.872 --> 59:04.407
I'm not gonna do that.

59:04.474 --> 59:06.242
It's a lot of pressure to
make the right decision.

59:06.309 --> 59:08.044
Like, I don't want to
make anybody mad.

59:08.111 --> 59:09.445
Like, everybody deserves
to go on a date.

59:09.512 --> 59:11.414
But, at the end of the day,
I can't pick everyone.

59:11.481 --> 59:14.284
I gotta pick two people who
I think maybe

59:14.350 --> 59:17.120
haven't had that
opportunity.

59:17.186 --> 59:20.623
So, as we all know,
I gotta make

59:20.690 --> 59:25.295
a pretty tricky
decision here.

59:25.361 --> 59:28.531
If I could pick all of you guys
to go on a date, I really would.

59:28.598 --> 59:32.068
I had to pick this round
someone who I thought really

59:32.135 --> 59:35.204
hasn't had a chance
to find something,

59:35.271 --> 59:38.775
like what I feel I've
found with Vay.

59:38.841 --> 59:40.710
I am picking...

59:40.777 --> 59:43.079
- Adam.
- Thank you, bro.

59:46.449 --> 59:50.219
I feel like you have had less
than 24 hours to...

59:50.286 --> 59:51.721
solidify anything with anyone.

59:51.788 --> 59:53.156
- Thank you.
- Got you, buddy.

59:53.222 --> 59:54.590
That's love.

59:54.657 --> 59:56.793
Now we gotta pick
your counterpart.

59:56.859 --> 59:59.329
Who's he gonna pick?
Is he gonna pick Illeana?

1:00:04.767 --> 1:00:06.803
Illeana...

1:00:06.869 --> 1:00:08.371
will you go on a date with him?

1:00:08.438 --> 1:00:10.640
[Beep]!

1:00:10.707 --> 1:00:12.408
I don't like Joey.

1:00:12.475 --> 1:00:16.179
I mean, Joey just
rubs me the wrong way.

1:00:16.245 --> 1:00:18.448
Illeana wants to go on this
date with Adam, I think,

1:00:18.514 --> 1:00:21.317
for sure, but she does know
that it's gonna hurt Brendan S.

1:00:21.384 --> 1:00:23.386
I'm baking the cake,
sprinkling some icing,

1:00:23.453 --> 1:00:25.254
and you can choose whether
you want to bite it or not.

1:00:25.321 --> 1:00:26.856
- We're doing it.
- This is now for you guys.

1:00:26.923 --> 1:00:28.224
- Yeah?
- Round two.

1:00:28.291 --> 1:00:30.126
Round two?
Back to back.

1:00:30.193 --> 1:00:31.761
Go get twisted.

1:00:31.828 --> 1:00:33.596
Joey, you know, he finally
makes a decision and

1:00:33.663 --> 1:00:36.366
he's just trying to cause a
little bit of a ruckus and

1:00:36.432 --> 1:00:39.635
trying to give Adam a chance,
again, with Illeana.

1:00:39.702 --> 1:00:42.639
Thank you, bro. I
appreciate that. Seriously.

1:00:42.705 --> 1:00:45.341
In order for me to give
my rose to Adam,

1:00:45.408 --> 1:00:48.411
I'd have to be truly
blown away.

1:00:48.478 --> 1:00:50.513
You never know what's going
to happen in Paradise.

1:00:59.822 --> 1:01:01.491
This is crazy.

1:01:01.557 --> 1:01:04.560
Are we about to
play some hockey?

1:01:10.066 --> 1:01:11.668
- This is gonna be interesting.
- Are you ready?

1:01:11.734 --> 1:01:12.769
You gonna show me your skills?

1:01:12.835 --> 1:01:14.237
Yeah, I'm gonna
show you my skills.

1:01:15.605 --> 1:01:17.673
Got the mitts out, too?
I love this.

1:01:17.740 --> 1:01:18.975
Okay, alright.

1:01:19.042 --> 1:01:21.411
I really want to show
Illeana a good time,

1:01:21.477 --> 1:01:25.014
and just that I'm free spirited
and love to just have fun.

1:01:25.081 --> 1:01:26.849
You're gonna have to
show me how to do this.

1:01:26.916 --> 1:01:29.352
I've never played
hockey before. Ready?

1:01:29.419 --> 1:01:31.554
- Let's go, let's do this.
- Just gotta get into it.

1:01:31.621 --> 1:01:32.889
You just gotta get
into it, yeah.

1:01:32.955 --> 1:01:34.824
Oh, and then I...

1:01:34.891 --> 1:01:36.993
I'm not here to compete
with other people.

1:01:37.060 --> 1:01:38.728
I know what I have to offer.

1:01:38.795 --> 1:01:42.298
I am definitely ready to show
what I got to Illeana.

1:01:42.365 --> 1:01:46.035
- Get low, stick that ass out.
- Okay, okay.

1:01:46.102 --> 1:01:48.871
- Go back.
- Yeah, there you go!

1:01:48.938 --> 1:01:51.541
- Alright, it went in.
- It went, yeah.

1:01:51.607 --> 1:01:54.544
It's lighthearted,
we're laughing, it's silly.

1:01:54.610 --> 1:01:56.813
Teach me some figure skating.

1:01:56.879 --> 1:02:01.884
Her energy is just so bubbly.
It just gives me life.

1:02:01.951 --> 1:02:04.420
Ah!

1:02:04.487 --> 1:02:06.722
You're like, "Illeana..."

1:02:06.789 --> 1:02:10.326
And, end scene.

1:02:10.393 --> 1:02:14.630
- Voila.
- Voila.

1:02:14.697 --> 1:02:17.633
The sexual chemistry
is out of control.

1:02:17.700 --> 1:02:21.037
It's an endless
giving tree right now.

1:02:21.104 --> 1:02:23.940
Like, it just makes me
want to be around her,

1:02:24.006 --> 1:02:27.076
and hug her and kiss
her all the time.

1:02:27.143 --> 1:02:29.645
I wanted to just have fun,
and just pick her up and

1:02:29.712 --> 1:02:31.047
have her in my arms, and...

1:02:31.114 --> 1:02:35.051
show her that I can carry you,
I can support you.

1:02:35.118 --> 1:02:36.953
I got you.

1:02:47.130 --> 1:02:49.065
Do I think, like, this guy's
gonna blow her out of the water?

1:02:49.132 --> 1:02:51.334
I don't know.
She has to understand,

1:02:51.400 --> 1:02:53.336
if I don't get a rose, like,
I'm just leaving.

1:02:53.402 --> 1:02:55.104
Obviously, waiting for
Illeana to come back.

1:02:55.171 --> 1:02:56.839
I'm not an over thinker
in real life,

1:02:56.906 --> 1:02:59.375
but in this scenario,
I'm overthinking.

1:02:59.442 --> 1:03:00.977
I just hate this for you.
Like, I know, like,

1:03:01.043 --> 1:03:02.845
I'm just trying to put
myself in your position.

1:03:02.912 --> 1:03:04.814
I would just be like
heart broken.

1:03:04.881 --> 1:03:06.649
I don't want to be that guy
that says, "Talk to people,

1:03:06.716 --> 1:03:08.618
do what you want,
but like no more dates,

1:03:08.684 --> 1:03:10.620
giving energy to other
people while I'm here like

1:03:10.686 --> 1:03:13.122
waiting to like open my
whole life up to you." So...

1:03:13.189 --> 1:03:14.290
Yeah.

1:03:14.357 --> 1:03:17.426
Adam just coming in to cause
a ruckus and do his thing.

1:03:17.493 --> 1:03:18.628
It's not easy.

1:03:18.694 --> 1:03:22.064
I'm hoping she knows I'm hurting
a little bit and I'm sad.

1:03:22.131 --> 1:03:26.435
I hope she is thinking
about me on that date.

1:03:26.502 --> 1:03:28.971
I am very curious of what's
going on in her mind and

1:03:29.038 --> 1:03:31.374
how she feels, emotionally.

1:03:31.440 --> 1:03:32.909
I'm a hopeless romantic.

1:03:32.975 --> 1:03:36.412
The sun's setting and I've
got Illeana in front of me.

1:03:36.479 --> 1:03:40.983
And I'm like kissing her
with everything I've got.

1:03:41.050 --> 1:03:45.721
I think he's an
incredible person.

1:03:45.788 --> 1:03:48.858
But I can't help but feel
like, okay, well,

1:03:48.925 --> 1:03:51.861
you're gonna have
to make a choice.

1:03:51.928 --> 1:03:54.030
No matter what I do,
I'm gonna end up

1:03:54.096 --> 1:03:55.898
hurting somebody's feelings.

1:03:59.535 --> 1:04:01.938
<i>Next time, on Bachelor in
Paradise Canada...</i>

1:04:02.004 --> 1:04:04.507
There is this rose ceremony
on the horizon,

1:04:04.574 --> 1:04:07.510
and I'm like very confused.

1:04:07.577 --> 1:04:10.479
Men are all about respect,
coming into Paradise.

1:04:10.546 --> 1:04:13.082
I had a blast. I wanted to
explore that more.

1:04:13.149 --> 1:04:15.952
I feel like pulling Illeana was
a big mistake for him.

1:04:16.018 --> 1:04:18.688
No disrespect, bro.
I don't give a

1:04:18.754 --> 1:04:21.157
Bro, what are you doing?

1:04:21.224 --> 1:04:24.126
To finding yourself and
finding love.

1:04:25.995 --> 1:04:27.897
Everybody's like...

1:04:27.964 --> 1:04:29.198
banking on me.

1:04:29.265 --> 1:04:31.434
If you give me
the rose tonight,

1:04:31.500 --> 1:04:33.803
I will have your back
the next time.

1:04:33.869 --> 1:04:36.572
I am absolutely so
torn right now.

1:04:36.639 --> 1:04:38.040
That one's
watching the show.

1:04:38.107 --> 1:04:40.476
- Where's the popcorn?
- It's fine.

1:04:40.543 --> 1:04:42.812
It's real, bro.
It's not watching a show.

1:04:44.714 --> 1:04:46.782
Kamil is just on
a downward spiral

1:04:46.849 --> 1:04:48.551
on his way out of Paradise.

1:04:48.618 --> 1:04:50.586
You're a rooster,
I'm a gorilla, like...

1:04:50.653 --> 1:04:51.754
Sit your ass down.

1:04:51.821 --> 1:04:53.122
I'm just gonna be
straight up with you.

1:04:53.189 --> 1:04:54.891
I want to take you on a date.

1:04:54.957 --> 1:04:57.693
I'm here to get in
people's lanes.

1:04:57.760 --> 1:04:59.495
I'm Mac Truck Mike.

1:04:59.562 --> 1:05:02.064
And, if you don't move over,
I'm gonna run you off the road.

1:05:02.131 --> 1:05:05.501
Are we all getting played?
Like, who's safe?

1:05:05.568 --> 1:05:08.738
It feels like... horrible.

1:05:08.804 --> 1:05:10.606
I just feel like I'm not enough.

1:05:10.673 --> 1:05:12.208
My intuition was right.

1:05:12.275 --> 1:05:14.243
I'm just so sick of this.

1:05:14.310 --> 1:05:16.479
I'm so sick of it.

1:05:16.545 --> 1:05:19.148
Why don't I get
my happiness?

1:05:19.215 --> 1:05:21.884
Just relationships, in general,
are very new to me.

1:05:21.951 --> 1:05:23.019
You know what I mean?

1:05:23.085 --> 1:05:26.055
But this, look, this experience
is new for all of us.

1:05:26.122 --> 1:05:28.524
I'm scared of being vulnerable.
I'm scared of hurting myself,

1:05:28.591 --> 1:05:30.226
I'm scared of putting myself
in a position where...

1:05:30.293 --> 1:05:32.662
But who isn't?
Don't beat yourself up.

1:05:32.728 --> 1:05:33.929
You deserve this.

1:05:33.996 --> 1:05:36.098
You have to be open,
you have to be vulnerable.

1:05:36.165 --> 1:05:37.333
You can't be scared.

1:05:37.400 --> 1:05:39.702
I promise you, nothing but good
things will come from this.

1:05:39.769 --> 1:05:40.970
- You think so?
- I promise you.

1:05:41.037 --> 1:05:44.173
But with Ange, it's, it was
just so easy, man.

1:05:44.240 --> 1:05:46.509
- When you know, you nose.
- Mhm.

1:05:46.575 --> 1:05:48.778
- You know.
- Yeah, man.

1:05:48.844 --> 1:05:50.212
First of all,
saying Brendan M.

1:05:50.279 --> 1:05:53.149
is an attractive
gentlemen is like...

1:05:53.215 --> 1:05:54.717
saying I'm not the sheriff,
okay?

1:05:54.784 --> 1:05:58.087
Brendan M. is a God.

1:05:58.154 --> 1:06:00.923
This man, are
you kidding me?

1:06:00.990 --> 1:06:03.960
Wow!
I get lost in his eyes.
