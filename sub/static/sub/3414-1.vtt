00:53.221 --> 00:56.884
Understand, Chapel.
This is a very sensitive operation.

01:01.763 --> 01:06.166
That island is considered a CIA asset.
I want those independent contractors...

01:06.166 --> 01:08.725
believing they're liberating those people.

01:12.273 --> 01:14.434
Did you think
that I was going to tell them...

01:14.434 --> 01:17.205
that they're risking their lives
so we can get rich off diamonds and oil?

01:24.452 --> 01:28.115
I need the best on this one
and I need plausible deniability.

01:33.295 --> 01:35.126
I shall give you the best.

01:43.472 --> 01:45.599
Kruger and Dekerk.

01:48.644 --> 01:50.578
<i>Munitions experts,
South Africans.</i>

01:50.578 --> 01:52.511
<i>More specifically, Afrikaners.</i>

01:52.511 --> 01:55.744
There is not a gun or a bullet
they cannot find or use.

01:55.744 --> 01:57.786
Five hundred kills to their credit.

01:58.287 --> 01:59.345
Lovely.

01:59.345 --> 02:01.252
This is Mr. Samuel Kay.

02:03.292 --> 02:07.626
<i>MIS and Al specialist.
Fluent in nine computer languages.</i>

02:07.626 --> 02:11.723
<i>Can, or more precisely, has hacked
his way into every system in the world...</i>

02:11.723 --> 02:14.064
including your own.

02:17.306 --> 02:20.298
<i>Especially when you consider
with whom they shall be working.</i>

02:20.298 --> 02:21.637
<i>Maxine Barnol.</i>

02:21.637 --> 02:25.078
<i>Where hardware hacking
and bribery won't work...</i>

02:25.078 --> 02:26.911
you need a muse.

02:27.951 --> 02:29.384
Extraordinary.

02:31.187 --> 02:33.985
9-3-60. This is Blind Eagle,
do you copy, over?

02:35.358 --> 02:38.816
Mr. Radio Jones,
communications specialist.

02:38.816 --> 02:43.661
And the only person capable
of talking Mr. John Seeger...

02:44.134 --> 02:46.068
into joining our little party.

02:50.607 --> 02:51.835
<i>John Seeger.</i>

02:53.143 --> 02:55.543
<i>The most decorated soldier
in the First Gulf War.</i>

02:58.381 --> 02:59.973
He's a wild card, Chapel.

02:59.973 --> 03:02.882
Yes. The best at doing what he does.

03:02.882 --> 03:04.943
Will he know we're behind this?

03:06.189 --> 03:07.451
Only if you want him to.

03:09.592 --> 03:12.390
Just make sure you keep it
under control, Chapel.

03:13.196 --> 03:14.686
We don't need a war.

03:15.632 --> 03:16.963
Peace.

03:38.289 --> 03:39.586
Though you cannot see it......

03:39.586 --> 03:42.242
....just over that hill
a fierce battle has

03:42.255 --> 03:44.921
erupted, sending civilians
fleeing for their lives.

04:34.946 --> 04:36.140
It's perfect.

04:36.140 --> 04:39.240
Johnny, hotwire this piece of shit
and lay a charge.

04:39.240 --> 04:41.285
You, rookie, it's time to show us
what you're made of.

04:42.621 --> 04:45.249
Jack a car in town,
and we move in on the target.

04:45.249 --> 04:47.018
Once she's clear, we go in with the truck.

04:47.018 --> 04:48.286
Do you think she's up to it?

04:48.286 --> 04:49.553
Hmm.

04:50.262 --> 04:52.594
Well, if she doesn't call us
after five minutes...

04:52.594 --> 04:54.188
we'll do it the old-fashioned way.

05:42.081 --> 05:43.844
The children will be down
in a minute.

05:43.844 --> 05:46.316
Please get their breakfast ready
on the table.

05:46.316 --> 05:48.853
I'm taking the Ambassador his coffee now.

05:56.796 --> 05:59.321
I have an urgent message
for the Ambassador.

06:23.724 --> 06:24.850
Guys, we're all clear.

07:02.764 --> 07:04.857
- May I pour your coffee for you?
- Yes, please.

07:35.596 --> 07:37.791
You two! Come with me.

07:42.470 --> 07:43.664
Come with me now.

07:43.664 --> 07:44.932
It's okay.

08:01.050 --> 08:02.112
<i>Bonjour.</i>

08:02.112 --> 08:03.180
What are you doing here?

08:03.180 --> 08:05.488
You know what the fuck I'm doing here.

08:05.488 --> 08:07.825
Your foreign policy sucks,
and we need you as insurance...

08:07.825 --> 08:08.920
to get out of this mess.

08:11.433 --> 08:14.561
- I'm the French Ambassador!
- I know who the fuck you are.

08:14.561 --> 08:16.866
I'm running a bit of a tight schedule,
so let's move!

08:23.512 --> 08:25.605
Get up on the truck.

08:25.605 --> 08:26.739
Move!

08:28.317 --> 08:29.682
Get! Go on!

08:30.786 --> 08:33.914
All right, get on the truck.
It's not a fucking holiday!

08:34.323 --> 08:35.448
Move!

08:36.091 --> 08:39.082
All right, let's move out!
We don't want to keep our friends waiting.

09:01.484 --> 09:04.044
Three days ago,
heavily armed mercenaries launched...

09:04.044 --> 09:06.816
a lightning raid
overthrowing Sibi Al Fukar...

09:06.816 --> 09:09.324
and his corrupt cadre of army officers...

09:09.324 --> 09:14.056
who have held this tiny island nation
in their iron grip for over three years.

09:14.297 --> 09:17.289
With the surprise arrival
of a brigade of French commandos...

09:17.289 --> 09:20.734
these mercenaries have been dislodged
from their positions around the city...

09:20.734 --> 09:24.830
and put on the defensive,
forced into a shrinking perimeter.

09:24.830 --> 09:27.206
As the French mass for a final assault...

09:27.206 --> 09:30.838
these besieged soldiers of fortune
now face a stark choice.

09:30.838 --> 09:34.609
The inside of a French jail cell or death.

10:05.683 --> 10:07.913
Colonel. Colonel.

10:08.352 --> 10:10.912
Colonel, will you risk an attack
even though these mercenaries...

10:10.912 --> 10:12.512
have taken civilian hostages?

10:18.095 --> 10:19.585
Colonel Roland, when do you strike?

10:20.864 --> 10:22.559
They have nowhere to go.

10:23.234 --> 10:27.034
We will overtake them
but we'll have hostages to consider.

10:27.034 --> 10:30.370
With your permission, I'd like to cross
the line and talk to the mercenaries.

10:30.370 --> 10:32.137
And yes, I understand what that means.

10:35.480 --> 10:36.811
Let her through.

10:37.682 --> 10:40.845
- Who the hell are you with?
- Looks like I'm with the mercenaries.

13:09.102 --> 13:11.400
Chief, I don't know where these numbers
are coming from!

13:11.400 --> 13:12.803
We're outnumbered. We're in trouble.

13:12.803 --> 13:15.069
Where are all these Frenchies
coming from?

13:18.980 --> 13:20.641
Get head office on the secure line.

13:21.883 --> 13:24.113
- Where's Kruger and his men?
- Last call we heard...

13:24.113 --> 13:27.177
Kruger took the French Ambassador
and his family for extra insurance.

13:27.177 --> 13:29.450
Why did you agree to work
with a slap-dick like that anyway?

13:29.450 --> 13:30.923
It wasn't my call.

13:34.328 --> 13:35.989
You two, move!

13:37.565 --> 13:39.157
Camera crew coming in!

13:39.667 --> 13:41.692
Maxine, what are you doing here?

13:41.692 --> 13:45.330
Man, you're supposed to stay out
of the danger zone to gather intel only.

13:45.330 --> 13:46.634
You hear that?

13:46.634 --> 13:49.904
Oh, okay, well how's this for intel?
The French have landed.

13:49.904 --> 13:51.604
Somebody fucked us! Who?

14:01.756 --> 14:04.247
Radio, give me that com unit.

14:04.792 --> 14:05.850
Damn it!

14:07.396 --> 14:10.160
Hello, Bravo! Bravo 1-2-3.

14:10.160 --> 14:11.529
Do you copy?

14:11.529 --> 14:13.500
Got our employers on the line here.

14:13.500 --> 14:16.037
Maybe it's time to swallow our pride
and call for a little help.

14:19.074 --> 14:21.542
This is another CIA "fuck you," isn't it?

14:21.542 --> 14:25.477
Oh, right, I forgot, the creed,
"Care for no one, fight for everyone."

14:25.477 --> 14:26.844
It's a good motto, isn't it?

14:29.218 --> 14:31.982
Sigma, this is Alpha 9. I repeat, Alpha 9.

14:32.821 --> 14:34.118
Do you read me?

14:34.118 --> 14:36.315
<i>Sigma,
this is Alpha 9. Say again, Alpha 9.</i>

14:37.493 --> 14:39.791
Chapel, you guaranteed me
this French fiasco would not happen.

14:39.791 --> 14:42.055
<i>Sigma, this is Alpha 9.
I repeat, Alpha 9.</i>

14:42.055 --> 14:44.155
You know,
I think we're in a refund situation.

14:44.155 --> 14:46.895
Shall I make the check out
to the CIA or to you?

14:46.895 --> 14:49.961
<i>- It's your call on this one, Dresham.
- Fuck you, Chapel.</i>

14:49.961 --> 14:52.097
It's a bit more for my mercs to handle.

14:52.641 --> 14:54.131
<i>Shall we call in the troops?</i>

14:54.131 --> 14:56.177
Those mercs, did they figure out
who they're working for?

14:56.177 --> 14:58.736
And what difference does that make?

14:58.736 --> 15:00.111
Because right now we need deniability...

15:00.111 --> 15:01.514
more than we need them back
in one piece.

15:01.514 --> 15:02.676
You understand me?

15:02.676 --> 15:04.049
We're still working the plan, Sigma.

15:04.049 --> 15:06.554
Didn't you say there would be
no counter-support?

15:06.554 --> 15:09.615
Can we expect any help from your end
with our extraction?

15:09.615 --> 15:11.057
You really want them back, Chapel?

15:11.494 --> 15:12.756
No help at all.

15:13.062 --> 15:14.689
<i>Chapel, you and Dresham fuck us on this...</i>

15:14.689 --> 15:17.756
I'm gonna stick my.45 up your ass
and break every bone in your body.

15:17.756 --> 15:20.826
- Chapel, this is getting out of control.
- You know something?

15:20.826 --> 15:24.396
The next time that you and the Agency
want to plan a little business trip...

15:24.396 --> 15:26.032
dial someone else.

15:27.977 --> 15:30.639
Fucking Yank. Excuse my language.

15:39.389 --> 15:40.981
All right, Jones, call in the chopper.

15:40.981 --> 15:43.116
Samuel, load up all the wounded.

15:43.116 --> 15:45.251
Send in a goddamn chopper now!

15:45.251 --> 15:46.852
You'll never learn, will you?

15:46.852 --> 15:49.296
- Who do you think we're working for?
- Heads up!

15:52.302 --> 15:54.533
I'd settle for
just getting the fuck out of here.

15:54.533 --> 15:56.334
I shouldn't have dragged you
into this, John.

15:56.334 --> 15:58.773
They used me to get ahold of you, man!

16:09.253 --> 16:12.450
You hang on, son.
I'm gonna get you on that chopper.

16:12.450 --> 16:14.421
Take care of Eddie.

16:15.426 --> 16:17.155
Hang on, Jones, you hear me?

16:17.155 --> 16:18.524
Shondra.

16:18.524 --> 16:19.824
Hang on, man.

16:20.097 --> 16:21.257
Promise me.

16:32.443 --> 16:34.070
Paul! Paul!

16:42.453 --> 16:45.149
Go! Code blue!
There's our pickup. Let's go!

16:48.994 --> 16:50.052
Stand back! Don't move!

16:50.052 --> 16:52.392
I'm press! I'm press!

16:52.392 --> 16:54.591
You just killed an innocent man, asshole!

17:11.816 --> 17:13.977
<i>Colonel, this is Kruger. Come in.</i>

17:17.589 --> 17:18.851
Mr. Kruger.

17:19.491 --> 17:21.482
There is nowhere for you to run.

17:21.960 --> 17:23.325
Now listen up...

17:23.325 --> 17:26.421
I got the French Ambassador
and his lovely family here...

17:26.421 --> 17:30.161
and the truck is rigged to blow,
so stand the fuck down.

17:44.884 --> 17:46.784
Tell them to hold their fire.

18:26.392 --> 18:28.383
Repeat. Everyone, stand down.

18:29.528 --> 18:30.756
Pull forward!

18:46.480 --> 18:50.382
- Colonel, what the fuck are you doing?
- Repeat, everyone, stand down.

18:56.623 --> 18:59.421
On my mark,
get the fuck out of that truck!

19:03.997 --> 19:05.328
Now! Get out!

19:05.328 --> 19:06.899
Go! Move!

19:21.081 --> 19:22.673
Keep moving!

19:23.483 --> 19:25.041
Come on, men! Move!

19:26.553 --> 19:28.487
Left bank, 20 degrees!

19:51.612 --> 19:53.603
Come on! Come on!

20:31.887 --> 20:33.184
Hey, hey.

20:33.455 --> 20:36.083
No worries, Johnny boy.
We made it, didn't we?

20:38.360 --> 20:40.954
I ought to fucking kill you right now, boy.

20:40.954 --> 20:43.791
- I don't think so.
- Yeah, maybe not right now.

20:55.444 --> 20:57.639
I hear the blacks in the States
fly really well.

20:57.639 --> 20:58.907
So why don't you and your buddy...

20:58.907 --> 21:01.108
hop in the tail and fly
the fuck out of here!

21:01.108 --> 21:03.344
I'll fly on the tail, Kruger,
if you don't mind me...

21:03.344 --> 21:07.081
throwing this grenade up in this helicopter
with all you motherfucking white folks!

21:11.059 --> 21:12.424
Forget about it.

21:16.331 --> 21:18.322
Yo, Seeger, come on, we're full!

21:18.322 --> 21:20.231
Leave him, we're full, man!

21:21.104 --> 21:24.164
Come on. Let's get the fuck out of here!
Come on!

21:25.975 --> 21:28.910
Come on! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

21:52.101 --> 21:53.125
Maxine?

21:53.403 --> 21:56.395
She'll play it through. She always does.

22:22.733 --> 22:24.826
The car's going too slow.

22:26.937 --> 22:28.529
Come on. Go.

22:32.810 --> 22:34.801
Oh, yeah. We're catching up.

22:35.646 --> 22:36.704
Whoa!

22:40.818 --> 22:43.582
<i>Today, Galmoral
was turned over to the UN by the French...</i>

22:43.582 --> 22:46.248
<i>ending a conflict
which began as a small coup...</i>

22:46.248 --> 22:48.484
<i>by antigovernment mercenaries...</i>

22:48.484 --> 22:50.789
<i>now celebrated as heroes here.</i>

22:51.061 --> 22:55.521
<i>This small island nation has its first
taste of freedom in over 100 years...</i>

22:55.521 --> 22:56.929
<i>and democratic elections...</i>

23:00.738 --> 23:03.673
You were correct.
One week, and he shows.

23:04.208 --> 23:05.505
Guess you know him well.

23:28.066 --> 23:29.090
Take him.

23:30.201 --> 23:32.601
- And meet me back at base.
- Take him?

23:33.071 --> 23:34.561
You make this shit sound easy.

23:40.578 --> 23:42.512
The lady says it's a go.

23:51.256 --> 23:52.951
Mom, it's the door.

23:52.951 --> 23:54.889
Put your video game down
and answer it for me.

23:55.527 --> 23:57.358
Do I have to?

24:03.369 --> 24:05.701
Hey, Eddie.
I don't know if you remember me.

24:06.038 --> 24:09.007
You used to live on the Army base
with me and your daddy.

24:09.007 --> 24:11.009
But Mom said he's not coming home.

24:11.009 --> 24:13.170
Well, there's nothing he wanted more
than to be with you.

24:16.549 --> 24:19.712
Eddie. Go to your room, honey.

24:26.792 --> 24:28.419
Why are you here, John?

24:29.762 --> 24:31.354
State Department already notified us.

24:37.136 --> 24:38.228
Why him?

24:45.377 --> 24:46.742
Why my baby?

24:50.149 --> 24:52.447
It was that coup in Africa, wasn't it?

24:52.918 --> 24:53.907
The one on the news?

24:55.020 --> 24:56.852
He always believed
he could make a difference.

24:58.091 --> 24:59.524
Casualties of war.

25:01.361 --> 25:03.022
You went along because of him, John.

25:04.598 --> 25:06.532
So tell me what I lost him to.

25:07.334 --> 25:08.824
Some stupid cause?

25:10.103 --> 25:12.037
And now they're gonna fly him back...

25:12.037 --> 25:14.505
and leave me with a folded flag
and a bunch of medals.

25:14.505 --> 25:16.633
It's not that simple. It was a covert op.

25:17.577 --> 25:20.603
- They're not bringing him back?
- Well, I'm bringing him back.

25:21.348 --> 25:23.873
And I'm telling you,
he's gonna get full military honors...

25:23.873 --> 25:25.212
and a proper burial.

25:31.124 --> 25:32.489
Listen...

25:34.828 --> 25:36.159
What is this?

25:36.159 --> 25:38.060
I'm gonna look after you
and the baby now.

26:04.559 --> 26:06.254
What the hell is taking so long?

26:06.254 --> 26:08.192
Don't worry.
He's gotta come out eventually.

26:26.514 --> 26:27.742
Tell me you've got him.

26:27.742 --> 26:29.373
Unfortunately I'm alive, and they're dead.

26:30.318 --> 26:33.310
John. John, it's good to hear from you.

26:33.310 --> 26:35.548
Look, I'm sorry about Jones.

26:35.548 --> 26:37.682
You know we had to maintain
plausible deniability.

26:37.682 --> 26:40.022
You know what? You fucked us,
and I'm not getting over that.

26:40.022 --> 26:41.959
But we can talk about that, John.

26:41.959 --> 26:44.692
<i>- So why don't you just come back in?
- Oh, I'm coming in.</i>

26:44.692 --> 26:47.530
Believe me, I'm coming in.
I'm coming in to get you.

26:47.530 --> 26:49.503
- You wanted a one-on-one.
- John, listen...

26:56.478 --> 26:58.412
Surveillance at the United Nations
in New York...

26:58.412 --> 27:00.345
turned up one of the people
you red-flagged.

27:00.345 --> 27:01.905
He had a suitcase filled with money.

27:02.351 --> 27:03.340
Thank you, Kelly.

27:10.626 --> 27:12.287
So, you're back in business, Chapel.

27:31.380 --> 27:32.904
Now, there's two ways
we can do this, John.

27:32.904 --> 27:34.676
We can all end up
looking like Swiss cheese...

27:34.676 --> 27:37.150
or we can go have a nice cup of coffee.
What's it gonna be?

27:37.150 --> 27:39.882
Let's go have a cup of coffee.

27:40.490 --> 27:41.752
Get this truck out of here.

27:58.041 --> 28:00.566
- Thank you.
- Kelly?

28:00.566 --> 28:03.612
Just in from the FBI, sir.
There's been a shootout in Miami.

28:03.612 --> 28:05.978
One of the dead has been identified
as a South African national.

28:06.816 --> 28:09.785
He's a mercenary.
We used him in Galmoral with Seeger.

28:10.086 --> 28:11.075
Great.

28:11.075 --> 28:15.113
Also, our two men's taking the Jones'
house, they've been found dead.

28:15.113 --> 28:18.557
Goddamn this. Where is Seeger?

28:18.961 --> 28:21.327
A witness said someone
matching his description...

28:21.327 --> 28:23.456
was taken away at the scene.
Maybe his friends.

28:23.456 --> 28:24.659
Seeger doesn't have friends.

28:24.659 --> 28:27.066
Besides, a commando-style
rescue mission in Miami...

28:27.066 --> 28:29.366
is gonna cost somebody
a great deal of money to organize.

28:30.807 --> 28:33.834
Get the jet ready. We're going to Miami.

28:34.645 --> 28:36.738
Dresham here, I need authorization.

28:40.084 --> 28:43.417
- Well, here's to you. Cheers.
- Yes.

28:50.694 --> 28:52.423
I heard the French had you.

28:54.531 --> 28:55.998
Like the CIA had you?

28:55.998 --> 28:58.762
I didn't know I was gonna be
twisting in the wind like this.

28:59.169 --> 29:03.128
I'd have never let them do that to me
and I'd have never let them do that to us.

29:07.411 --> 29:10.539
The only reason I took this job
was so I could look you in the eye...

29:10.539 --> 29:13.082
and tell you
I've killed for money, I've lied...

29:13.082 --> 29:15.710
but my heart never got sold out
with the contract.

29:17.988 --> 29:19.216
Until now.

29:23.160 --> 29:24.752
He's waiting for you.

29:27.365 --> 29:28.957
You deserve each other.

29:30.101 --> 29:31.830
And I thought ladies liked the bad boys.

29:37.709 --> 29:39.199
I think she's mad at me.

29:39.811 --> 29:42.712
How are you, John?
I understand your anger.

29:43.314 --> 29:46.579
I don't think that anyone really
appreciates all that you do for them...

29:46.579 --> 29:48.050
especially your country.

29:48.050 --> 29:51.520
Yeah, three people died today.
I was kind of wondering why.

29:52.023 --> 29:53.547
Either for nothing or for something.

29:55.627 --> 29:59.028
It's your choice. You make the decision.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.964
<i>This is our assignment
for Mr. Ahmet Dasan...</i>

30:03.268 --> 30:05.259
<i>a billionaire extraordinaire.</i>

30:05.537 --> 30:07.505
Mr. Chapel has arrived, sir.

30:08.673 --> 30:10.971
- Ahmet Dasan.
- Pleasure.

30:11.709 --> 30:13.472
Please, walk with me.

30:15.280 --> 30:19.148
- You are aware of my problem?
- Yes, sir, I've looked into your request.

30:19.617 --> 30:22.018
But I must say,
it's beyond my capabilities.

30:22.421 --> 30:25.219
Quite simply put, it cannot be done.
I am sorry.

30:26.058 --> 30:29.255
In four days from now,
the United States Justice Department...

30:29.255 --> 30:31.421
will be transferring my son
from South Africa...

30:31.421 --> 30:33.965
to a lockdown facility
in Leavenworth, Kansas.

30:33.965 --> 30:36.058
A lovely facility, I'm told.

30:36.058 --> 30:39.070
Guarded by the largest infantry division
of the US Army.

30:39.070 --> 30:40.662
A well-known fact.

30:41.240 --> 30:43.003
But until then...

30:43.676 --> 30:48.204
the South Africans are detaining Kamal at
the Randveld Prison outside of Cape Town.

30:48.981 --> 30:51.415
I'm told it's a lovely facility, too.

30:53.919 --> 30:57.411
To snatch your son from Randveld...

30:58.390 --> 31:01.757
the most heavily fortified prison
in the southern hemisphere.

31:03.496 --> 31:08.456
- Yet, it is not quite Leavenworth.
- Almost. Trust me, it can't be done.

31:08.801 --> 31:12.828
I have controlled the arms pipeline
through the Middle East for 20 years.

31:13.672 --> 31:17.473
Money? I am a billionaire
many times over.

31:17.978 --> 31:22.176
And I would spend every bit of it
to free my first-born child.

31:22.916 --> 31:27.182
But in order for an operation of this type
to be completely successful...

31:27.182 --> 31:32.054
I should anticipate a certain risk
and a certain expense.

31:32.626 --> 31:35.254
That is just your payment, Mr. Chapel.

31:35.629 --> 31:39.326
A quarter down, the rest
when my son is standing before me.

31:39.326 --> 31:42.401
Now, tell me again
how some things just can't be done?

31:43.603 --> 31:45.537
I do stand corrected, sir.

31:47.140 --> 31:50.166
You will find $20 million
in an account in the Cayman Islands.

31:50.166 --> 31:53.870
When that amount has been depleted,
it will be automatically refilled.

31:54.414 --> 31:57.406
And how many times may I deplete it, sir?

31:57.406 --> 32:01.352
You will know when you've reached
the limits of my indulgence.

32:02.489 --> 32:03.547
How?

32:04.824 --> 32:07.918
There will be a bullet
in your head, Mr. Chapel.

32:11.699 --> 32:14.793
Everything you need to know
about Randveld is in these files.

32:16.737 --> 32:17.931
You decide.

32:18.372 --> 32:19.896
Here you go.

32:22.777 --> 32:24.176
I'm not interested.

32:25.913 --> 32:30.714
My employer's money has no idea
of what that concept means, John.

32:41.253 --> 32:45.356
<i>John, they said they'd kill us
if you didn't help them.</i>

32:47.735 --> 32:51.398
<i>Please, John, don't let them hurt my baby.
We need your help.</i>

32:51.398 --> 32:53.736
<i>They say they're going
to take us to Africa.</i>

32:53.736 --> 32:56.276
John, I am going to need your help.

32:58.346 --> 32:59.813
You know what?

32:59.813 --> 33:03.816
I'm kind of fascinated that you just
don't have any means of persuasion.

33:03.816 --> 33:05.352
Are you referring to a gun?

33:05.352 --> 33:06.409
Mmm.

33:06.722 --> 33:08.485
I don't touch a gun.

33:08.485 --> 33:11.287
And guns don't touch me.
That's why I'm still alive.

33:11.287 --> 33:13.487
I think it'd be good if you let them go.

33:13.829 --> 33:18.789
I think it would be nice if you understood
that I'm a pushover, but I am not an idiot.

33:19.401 --> 33:23.804
And you promised Radio Jones
that you would take care of little Eddie.

33:23.804 --> 33:27.364
And little Eddie is being taken care of,
as you can see, quite well.

33:27.364 --> 33:31.276
You kind of got me over a barrel.
How much time do I have?

33:31.276 --> 33:34.577
You have all the time in the world
as long as you do it within four days.

33:34.816 --> 33:38.684
- Four days is just not enough time.
- But we have money.

33:39.087 --> 33:42.579
And money has a way
of making time irrelevant.

33:43.225 --> 33:46.353
There might even be
something in it for you, John.

33:46.561 --> 33:48.256
What do you say
we get this show on the road?

33:49.331 --> 33:51.697
Tell the pilot we're ready to go.

34:00.977 --> 34:02.103
Okay, great.

34:02.103 --> 34:04.612
Look, I want a search
of all the high-end hotels in Miami.

34:04.612 --> 34:07.149
The penthouses.
Chapel's going to be in one of them.

34:11.920 --> 34:13.047
Never mind.

34:15.525 --> 34:16.992
What a pleasant surprise.

34:19.362 --> 34:20.556
Thank you.

34:29.938 --> 34:32.065
Someone's got some explaining to do.

34:37.947 --> 34:39.744
Computer support,
I'm gonna need somebody...

34:39.744 --> 34:41.750
who can get a hands-up on that
right away.

34:41.750 --> 34:44.719
- Do you have any word on Samuel?
- Loyalty in a mercenary.

34:45.321 --> 34:48.620
John, that's a character flaw.

34:48.620 --> 34:50.989
- It is, isn't it?
- Actually, he's on board.

34:50.989 --> 34:55.020
Couldn't resist being here
after that disaster in Africa.

34:55.020 --> 34:57.465
Excellent. I suppose I'll get
to see him soon.

34:57.465 --> 34:58.626
Samuel?

35:03.841 --> 35:08.778
Would you like to inform John
as to why you came so willingly?

35:09.079 --> 35:13.379
- I'm here for you, John.
- Fellow mercs reunited.

35:13.884 --> 35:17.445
Oh, the hate and mistrust.
Warms my heart.

35:17.445 --> 35:20.718
John, you never asked about Maxine.

35:22.760 --> 35:26.821
- I thought you and she were...
- You're right. I didn't ask.

35:27.331 --> 35:30.164
Chapel must have deep pockets
if he was able to buy you.

35:30.501 --> 35:33.868
I suppose so. Sorry, have we met before?

35:33.868 --> 35:36.598
Oh, we partied on the same island once.

35:36.598 --> 35:38.970
Now, tell me about Chapel
and your boyfriend.

35:40.544 --> 35:42.375
As far as I know, they've
already taken off.

35:42.613 --> 35:45.378
- Kelly, get on it.
- Yes, sir.

35:45.984 --> 35:48.248
- You can keep the money.
- Honey...

35:49.454 --> 35:50.512
you work for me now.

35:55.460 --> 35:56.449
What do you have?

35:56.449 --> 35:59.793
Private jet manifest
shows 15 unidentified passengers.

35:59.793 --> 36:01.855
- Going where?
- Flight plan says South Africa...

36:01.855 --> 36:03.662
but it could be anywhere
south of the pyramids.

36:03.662 --> 36:07.068
- Maxine?
- Chapel has plenty of muscle and money.

36:07.068 --> 36:09.538
Where he chooses to flex them
is none of my business.

36:09.538 --> 36:13.407
Oh, really? Oh, but
seeing Seeger one last time was, right?

36:14.179 --> 36:18.240
You're really afraid of him, aren't you?
Why? Does he have something on you?

36:19.184 --> 36:22.244
- So John does have a weakness.
- Meaning what?

36:22.854 --> 36:26.312
Meaning he'll come for you.
So, we're going to Africa, huh?

36:27.292 --> 36:28.452
How about a safari?

36:37.468 --> 36:41.166
Look, I don't like the way shit went down,
you know that.

36:41.507 --> 36:43.065
And those men you let in?

36:43.065 --> 36:45.042
One thing for sure,
when you're a mercenary...

36:45.042 --> 36:46.737
you're always gonna have casualties.

36:52.418 --> 36:55.251
- Guaranteed?
- Guaranteed.

38:15.235 --> 38:17.499
- Where's the goddamn car, Kelly?
- Over there, sir.

38:19.005 --> 38:21.030
Then what the fuck happened?
Where are they?

38:21.030 --> 38:23.735
- They passed through the VIP line, sir.
- How did they do that?

38:23.735 --> 38:26.608
- They had diplomatic passports.
- Great. Of course, they did.

38:54.375 --> 38:56.969
This is Kamal Dasan,
son of Ahmet Dasan...

38:56.969 --> 39:01.378
Greek billionaire arms dealer.
Our job is to break him out of prison.

39:02.116 --> 39:03.845
Our intel says that Dasan, Jr...

39:03.845 --> 39:06.614
is being kept at the most secure facility
at Randveld.

39:06.614 --> 39:09.679
So, there's guard stations at every point
and marshals backing them up.

39:09.679 --> 39:11.588
But I don't think we'll have
a problem with that.

39:11.588 --> 39:13.217
How the fuck you figure that?

39:13.217 --> 39:15.285
At 10:00 there's gonna be a shift change.

39:15.285 --> 39:18.821
Because of the large number of guards
that are entering and exiting...

39:19.066 --> 39:21.900
they're disabling their alarm system
for about six minutes.

39:21.900 --> 39:24.905
That's when we'll make our move.
So, this is what's gonna happen.

39:24.905 --> 39:26.974
The perimeter sensors are still left on.

39:26.974 --> 39:30.011
Samuel's going to disable the system
in the northeast sector...

39:30.011 --> 39:32.444
which is gonna indicate
a break-in in that area.

39:32.444 --> 39:35.745
Obviously, when that happens all the
exits will be automatically locked...

39:35.745 --> 39:39.150
except for the guard entrances,
for obvious reasons.

39:39.150 --> 39:42.019
From this entrance, they're gonna
have direct access to the core...

39:42.019 --> 39:43.421
which is where our boy is.

39:43.421 --> 39:45.551
We may have to take
a couple of guards out...

39:45.551 --> 39:48.118
and then we may have to deal
with the marshals with CXL.

39:48.118 --> 39:50.494
What do you think, Kruger?
You think you can handle that?

39:50.494 --> 39:53.659
Fuck, yeah, but why don't we use
nerve gas on these pussies?

39:53.659 --> 39:55.803
Well, with nerve gas, we're quite afraid...

39:55.803 --> 39:58.169
that we may kill everybody,
especially our boy...

39:58.169 --> 40:00.936
similar to the girls
that you are used to killing.

40:01.410 --> 40:04.846
You wanna dance, motherfucker?
Get up. Get up!

40:05.781 --> 40:09.842
So I think it's much better
if we act like professional soldiers.

40:10.552 --> 40:14.682
- Don't you?
- That's not in your job description.

40:15.458 --> 40:18.450
- Let's get back to work.
- Yes, sir. That would be nice.

40:23.599 --> 40:25.863
We have a hole for you in Angola...

40:26.803 --> 40:29.203
with your name on it, Kruger.

40:32.442 --> 40:34.205
Everybody feeling up for this?

40:37.180 --> 40:38.408
All right.

40:54.630 --> 40:56.860
John asked me to give you this.

41:13.250 --> 41:15.150
Mr. Dresham
would like to speak to you.

41:26.930 --> 41:28.022
What did he want?

41:29.900 --> 41:33.301
He wants me to gather intelligence for
an operation he's running in Cape Town.

41:33.301 --> 41:34.928
Did he tell you what the target was?

41:36.373 --> 41:39.740
Is it the Agency that wants John so badly
or is it just you?

41:40.077 --> 41:41.442
Does it matter?

42:18.716 --> 42:21.742
- Have the Americans arrived yet?
- They're right behind you.

42:24.689 --> 42:29.126
Mr. Dresham, Spano Malik,
Chief of Police, Cape Town.

42:31.429 --> 42:34.330
Mr. Malik, we have reason to believe
there's going to be an attempt...

42:34.330 --> 42:36.026
to break into the black vault.

42:36.968 --> 42:39.061
This is an official request from the CIA.

42:39.061 --> 42:41.833
Your Foreign Affairs Division
have asked you to help us on this one.

42:43.141 --> 42:45.336
This is absurd. Totally absurd.

42:46.511 --> 42:50.174
- Humor me.
- It's not possible. Can't be done.

42:50.174 --> 42:51.510
The bank's security systems...

42:51.510 --> 42:54.051
were designed
by Cape Town's top security specialists.

42:56.754 --> 42:59.883
Well, what are we talking about here,
some sort of private army or something?

42:59.883 --> 43:03.360
Mr. Malik, you should assume these men
are as well-trained as they are financed.

43:03.896 --> 43:05.261
Considering they've overthrown
the governments...

43:05.261 --> 43:09.461
of some of your largest depositors,
maybe you should pay attention.

43:10.836 --> 43:12.326
So, what's the CIA's interest?

43:12.738 --> 43:15.206
There's an American national involved,
but we'll take care of him.

43:18.377 --> 43:20.811
But even if your information is correct,
it's still impossible.

43:21.113 --> 43:22.205
Impossible?

43:24.650 --> 43:25.674
Maybe.

43:26.385 --> 43:29.377
- Well, let's sign you in.
- Let's.

43:31.523 --> 43:35.584
All control points are guarded,
blast doors that seal on the first alarm.

43:35.828 --> 43:37.557
Video surveillance, naturally.

43:37.997 --> 43:41.763
The doors are titanium-vanadium alloy...

43:41.763 --> 43:43.961
with six different blast buffers.

43:44.670 --> 43:48.299
Yeah, you could blow them in, but with
the amount of explosives you'd need...

43:48.299 --> 43:50.501
you'd probably bring
the whole building down on top of you.

43:50.843 --> 43:54.803
This is the storage database for the
12 largest banks in southern Africa.

43:55.215 --> 43:58.275
You see, Mr. Dresham,
money is no longer a dollar bill.

43:58.275 --> 44:00.911
It's a string of computer numbers
with a name attached...

44:00.911 --> 44:04.923
and our many depositors from all over
the world require three things of us...

44:04.923 --> 44:07.755
safety, security and anonymity.

44:08.662 --> 44:09.924
Well, of course they do.

44:11.231 --> 44:14.792
There are no hard copies
to these blueprints.

44:16.569 --> 44:19.129
- Absolutely no one has access.
- Good.

44:19.539 --> 44:23.839
The software is all hardwired
so they come up only on this unit.

44:23.839 --> 44:27.243
Try to copy, delete, print,
or transfer any of them...

44:27.243 --> 44:30.442
they auto encrypt on a 256-bit key.

44:35.789 --> 44:38.815
The vault itself is opened...

44:38.815 --> 44:41.952
only with two magnetic strip keys...

44:41.952 --> 44:45.327
and a corresponding
offsite security code...

44:45.327 --> 44:48.232
- which changes every six minutes.
- Impressive.

44:48.769 --> 44:52.068
Clearly, your client's money is
in very, very good hands, Mr. Malik.

44:52.540 --> 44:55.771
Indeed. I mean, these guys would be crazy
to even try...

44:55.771 --> 44:57.970
They won't. They don't have a chance.

44:57.970 --> 45:01.412
We intend to put a stop to this little
party long before it gets that far.

45:01.882 --> 45:03.042
Good.

45:03.042 --> 45:07.153
Well, our department expects
to be kept fully informed. Understood?

45:07.153 --> 45:11.317
Well, actually, I don't even do that
for my own government...

45:11.992 --> 45:13.619
but I'm here for you.

45:15.329 --> 45:16.489
Mr. Malik.

45:18.032 --> 45:19.192
Shall we?

45:30.277 --> 45:33.337
Seeger's gotta be crazy
to try and break into that place.

45:33.547 --> 45:34.536
Why?

45:34.536 --> 45:37.379
You heard the man,
nobody has access to those files.

45:38.619 --> 45:41.783
I want you to find out where Seeger
and Chapel are operating from.

45:42.491 --> 45:45.016
- I don't think he trusts me that much.
- Really?

45:46.261 --> 45:51.130
Well, you don't get paid to think, Maxine,
so fuck him and find out.

45:53.602 --> 45:54.591
Pimp.

46:03.478 --> 46:07.676
Can anyone tell me why we've put
the control station so far from the prison?

46:07.883 --> 46:10.249
Because they invented
wireless transmission.

46:10.786 --> 46:13.414
I mean, you did buy us that cellular
relay tower on the mountain, right?

46:13.822 --> 46:15.084
Indeed.

46:15.791 --> 46:20.228
So, we control half the cellular phone
transmission in the city, why?

46:20.862 --> 46:22.693
Because when the prison goes down...

46:22.693 --> 46:25.597
the locals might triangulate
our communication traffic.

46:26.234 --> 46:28.532
- Now, where would that lead them?
- Hello, old boy.

46:29.137 --> 46:33.198
I understand that you want
to use Maxine as a distraction.

46:34.410 --> 46:38.744
She's been in bed with Dresham all along.
Oh, wrong choice of words.

46:39.248 --> 46:42.046
But we do need to do something
about her.

46:42.718 --> 46:43.707
Who's going to do it?

46:44.454 --> 46:46.012
- I'll do it.
- Well done.

46:52.295 --> 46:55.822
- Seeger, you don't have to do this.
- Well, this time it's different.

46:56.199 --> 46:58.724
His name is Eddie,
and I made him a promise.

47:02.805 --> 47:05.933
- That was a wonderful night, honey.
- It really was, thank you so much.

47:07.066 --> 47:08.542
Where the hell is he?

47:08.542 --> 47:11.512
He said to meet him here
and wear my best.

47:11.914 --> 47:16.351
Remember, use the beacon
if I lose you in traffic. We want Seeger.

47:20.189 --> 47:24.592
I get it. You don't talk because, like,
maybe if you had to kill somebody...

47:24.592 --> 47:26.594
afterwards it would be hard.

47:26.963 --> 47:31.526
You know, you got that statuesque
kind of, you know, stoic look on your face.

47:31.526 --> 47:33.229
See, with me, it's never hard.

47:53.323 --> 47:56.486
- Where are we going?
- It's a surprise.

48:00.564 --> 48:02.532
Why did you have me dress up like this?

48:02.799 --> 48:05.267
Well, I promised you
after this last fiasco was over...

48:05.267 --> 48:08.862
I'd take you out, do something nice,
so here we are.

48:11.942 --> 48:14.035
- Are we being followed?
- No.

48:16.013 --> 48:17.412
Bulldog, take that side road.

48:20.951 --> 48:22.009
Side road?

48:22.854 --> 48:25.379
Strange road, two men like you.

48:26.524 --> 48:29.049
That could mean one of two things, right?

48:29.994 --> 48:34.090
Either this will end up being really bad
or really good.

48:36.868 --> 48:38.165
Max, how well do you know me?

48:39.804 --> 48:41.772
- Really good.
- There you go.

49:01.693 --> 49:02.717
Right this way, sir.

49:07.999 --> 49:10.729
Lobster's good here.
I'm gonna order you some.

49:18.611 --> 49:19.908
Thank you, sir.

49:52.444 --> 49:53.741
Chapel here.

49:53.741 --> 49:55.336
<i>Listen, Chapel, my friend.</i>

49:55.547 --> 49:58.948
We played your game long enough.
Now we're gonna do things my way.

49:58.948 --> 50:02.454
And what made you think
that you have any leverage, old chum?

50:02.655 --> 50:05.590
One call and there's a bullet
in the boy's brain.

50:05.590 --> 50:07.455
<i>A terrible thing to waste,
wouldn't you say?</i>

50:07.660 --> 50:09.753
I'm talking about the bullet.

50:10.162 --> 50:12.893
Periodically I'm gonna call you
and ask for proof of life.

50:13.133 --> 50:15.158
You're gonna give it to me right away...

50:15.535 --> 50:18.993
and if you don't, the game's over,
you hear me? Now, put the boy on.

50:20.507 --> 50:21.769
All right.

50:22.809 --> 50:23.833
Very well.

50:25.545 --> 50:29.174
The little boy packed
his school bag and got ready for school.

50:31.317 --> 50:33.251
<i>Chapel here. Put the boy on.</i>

50:34.821 --> 50:37.813
Are you there, John? Listen.

50:41.361 --> 50:42.589
Eddie?

50:44.931 --> 50:45.920
<i>Eddie?</i>

50:45.920 --> 50:47.023
Yeah.

50:47.367 --> 50:50.495
- Is that you, son?
- Yes.

50:51.671 --> 50:53.400
Listen. How're you doing?

50:53.400 --> 50:55.839
<i>- You and your mom all right?
- Yeah.</i>

50:57.844 --> 50:59.829
All right. You hang
in there, you hear me?

50:59.842 --> 51:01.837
That's quite
enough.

51:04.952 --> 51:09.480
John, you've had your proof.
Now get back to work.

51:09.724 --> 51:12.887
<i>I'll play you something sexy
to put you in the mood...</i>

51:12.887 --> 51:14.825
<i>for you and the lady of your choice.</i>

51:19.233 --> 51:21.201
It's a dangerous game
you're playing, John.

51:24.205 --> 51:26.696
Yeah, it is. One second.

52:20.495 --> 52:24.022
<i>- You looking for me?
- Yeah. That's it for you, Poepol.</i>

53:41.110 --> 53:42.577
Damn, that's a lot of work.

53:43.479 --> 53:45.913
You know, Bulldog,
you never did say where you're from.

53:45.913 --> 53:48.713
But let me guess, don't tell me. Detroit.

53:49.253 --> 53:52.086
Detroit, Michigan. How'd you guess?

53:52.556 --> 53:55.116
You know what? I'm from Detroit.
Highland Park.

53:55.993 --> 53:58.018
Two Motor City boys, just like that.

53:58.018 --> 54:00.529
Let's get out of here and go have a drink,
what do you say?

54:00.529 --> 54:03.532
- You buying?
- All right.

54:03.532 --> 54:05.568
We're gonna have to leave a big tip.

54:17.247 --> 54:18.771
What happened in there?

54:19.950 --> 54:21.315
Care to dance?

54:47.412 --> 54:49.846
We located them
on a satellite track this morning.

54:49.846 --> 54:52.348
- Where are they?
- At a deserted church in Woodstock.

54:52.348 --> 54:54.385
They were using it as a staging area.

54:54.385 --> 54:56.511
- Good. So you got them, right?
- No.

54:56.511 --> 54:59.750
When we got there, they must've just left.
The place was deserted.

55:01.559 --> 55:04.392
- Motherfucker's hitting the bank.
- The bank?

55:06.998 --> 55:09.523
Seeger, he's hitting the bank right now.

55:09.523 --> 55:12.865
Listen, I want every cop in this
godforsaken place at that bank right now!

55:12.865 --> 55:15.531
- You understand me?
- Right, right.

55:16.040 --> 55:19.601
I want all cars down to
the Credit Natal immediately. Right now!

55:39.631 --> 55:40.996
It's a go to you, John.

55:44.169 --> 55:45.727
Well, well, well.

55:45.727 --> 55:48.739
You've made it abundantly apparent
that I don't work for you anymore.

55:48.739 --> 55:49.899
But I'm just curious.

55:49.899 --> 55:53.069
Why do you keep sending your boys
to mess up my dinner dates?

55:53.069 --> 55:54.271
John?

55:55.447 --> 55:57.642
You know, I can make
all the bad things go away.

55:57.950 --> 55:59.577
Everything but this.

55:59.852 --> 56:01.786
Tiger, this is Mouse,
what's happening at the Beehive?

56:08.093 --> 56:09.526
All set to go.

56:09.862 --> 56:11.887
You got any activities at target?

56:49.769 --> 56:54.706
Change of the guard coming up
in three, two, one.

56:56.409 --> 56:58.036
Alarms are down.

56:59.446 --> 57:00.538
Go ahead and move in.

57:02.449 --> 57:06.010
- Copy that, alarms are down. Go in now.
- Right, we're going in.

58:24.399 --> 58:25.388
Get me out of here, man!

58:55.363 --> 58:57.297
We're almost there.
Is our support in position?

58:58.767 --> 59:00.234
Hey, you copy?

59:00.569 --> 59:02.002
What the fuck, are you asleep?

59:05.941 --> 59:07.602
Okay, we're running out of time.
Let's move!

59:26.629 --> 59:27.823
Back off!

59:30.666 --> 59:32.600
Get the fuck out of my way!

59:37.006 --> 59:38.234
What the fuck?

59:38.975 --> 59:40.203
<i>Yo, Kruger.</i>

59:40.203 --> 59:42.642
<i>Remember you said you'd rather die
than integrate?</i>

59:43.012 --> 59:44.946
Yeah, well, now's your chance.

59:45.448 --> 59:46.437
Fuck!

59:48.417 --> 59:50.510
It's a setup. Let's get
the fuck out of here!

01:00:10.941 --> 01:00:12.408
Keep your eyes open.

01:00:12.843 --> 01:00:14.105
What the fuck?

01:00:57.154 --> 01:01:01.387
Damn! TV in this country is quite violent.

01:01:12.437 --> 01:01:15.338
You got an open vehicle on your left.

01:01:43.067 --> 01:01:45.661
Let's go, go, go, go! Get us out of here!

01:02:00.853 --> 01:02:02.115
Hold fast.

01:02:07.259 --> 01:02:09.887
Come on, you wanna play chicken,
motherfucker?

01:02:16.268 --> 01:02:17.257
Go!

01:02:29.248 --> 01:02:30.681
Take the wheel!

01:02:45.464 --> 01:02:48.025
We are home and dry, my brother!

01:02:48.768 --> 01:02:51.498
Come on! Let's go!

01:03:03.116 --> 01:03:04.447
You son of a bitch, John.

01:03:04.918 --> 01:03:09.116
Oh, that's not nice. Come on, now.

01:03:09.322 --> 01:03:12.314
- Is this your first time in the field?
- Fuck you.

01:03:12.692 --> 01:03:14.387
You got any last words?

01:03:16.229 --> 01:03:18.356
You're a patriot, John.

01:03:18.731 --> 01:03:21.461
I mean, we both know
that's what you are, right?

01:03:22.535 --> 01:03:26.403
I mean, those hostages,
I think about them everyday, you know.

01:03:26.403 --> 01:03:29.408
Somehow I just kind of feel
like that's not quite the truth.

01:03:29.408 --> 01:03:33.105
Oh, looky here. It must be your lucky day.

01:03:33.847 --> 01:03:35.747
Po-po's just came up in here.

01:03:38.885 --> 01:03:40.409
What are you waiting for?
Back door!

01:03:40.409 --> 01:03:41.886
It's empty.

01:03:48.929 --> 01:03:50.760
The man's a fucking ghost.

01:03:51.265 --> 01:03:52.357
Fuck this.

01:03:57.771 --> 01:03:59.170
It's unbelievable.

01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:02.005
All right, be at target in four minutes.

01:04:04.771 --> 01:04:05.834
Dresham.

01:04:07.381 --> 01:04:09.212
We gotta talk fast.

01:04:09.212 --> 01:04:11.979
This better be worth real money
because after this, I'm done.

01:04:11.979 --> 01:04:13.610
You said you had to talk fast.

01:04:13.610 --> 01:04:16.315
I got John to loosen up
a little bit last night.

01:04:16.315 --> 01:04:20.520
He told me that Credit Natal
is just a diversion for the real target.

01:04:22.563 --> 01:04:23.552
Randveld.

01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:27.592
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

01:04:29.203 --> 01:04:32.195
It's a diversion.
They're hitting Randveld Prison.

01:04:32.195 --> 01:04:33.535
Clean this fucking mess up.

01:04:35.342 --> 01:04:37.573
We got a 409 in progress
at Randveld Prison.

01:04:37.573 --> 01:04:39.841
I want all units
to Randveld Prison immediately.

01:04:39.841 --> 01:04:41.109
Yeah, go!

01:05:05.507 --> 01:05:07.600
<i>- Samuel.
- All clear.</i>

01:05:20.855 --> 01:05:24.347
- May I help you?
- Detective Eric Morris, Cape Town Police.

01:05:24.347 --> 01:05:27.293
We have a situation we'd like to discuss
with your security.

01:05:27.762 --> 01:05:28.854
Sure.

01:05:31.267 --> 01:05:32.291
Yeah?

01:05:32.291 --> 01:05:35.929
Sir, we have a Lieutenant Eric Morris from
Cape Town Police Department to see you.

01:05:35.929 --> 01:05:37.199
Okay, escort him down.

01:05:41.544 --> 01:05:42.875
So, what's this about, Lieutenant?

01:05:42.875 --> 01:05:46.176
As you know we've received
some credible intel that there's...

01:05:46.176 --> 01:05:48.341
a bomb threat here,
particularly in the black vault.

01:05:48.341 --> 01:05:49.406
I haven't heard a thing.

01:05:50.119 --> 01:05:52.144
Well, check with your supervisor.
I'm sure you will.

01:05:58.427 --> 01:06:00.452
Reach out and rob someone.

01:06:11.207 --> 01:06:13.038
We're having a communications problem.

01:06:13.542 --> 01:06:14.907
I can't confirm what you're saying.

01:06:15.411 --> 01:06:17.106
All right. Listen, son, what's your name?

01:06:18.914 --> 01:06:20.643
- Stanley Morgan.
- Okay, Stanley.

01:06:20.643 --> 01:06:22.741
We can do this the easy way
or the hard way.

01:06:22.741 --> 01:06:25.617
Easy way is you're gonna tell me
what I need to know and I'll be out.

01:06:25.617 --> 01:06:28.658
Hard way is I'm gonna be scraping you
off the ground from outside.

01:06:28.658 --> 01:06:31.285
This is a time-critical situation.

01:06:31.285 --> 01:06:33.761
Look, even if I wanted to
I couldn't help you.

01:06:33.761 --> 01:06:36.390
All right.
You do have the magnetic keys, don't you?

01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:39.230
Yeah, but we don't have
the security access codes.

01:06:39.230 --> 01:06:41.998
You know what?
That's where this will come in.

01:06:43.073 --> 01:06:44.199
No problem.

01:06:45.509 --> 01:06:47.704
We got about six minutes,
and the clock is ticking.

01:06:47.704 --> 01:06:49.746
But I really should contact someone.

01:06:50.213 --> 01:06:52.238
Let's pull a code from cyberspace.

01:06:56.019 --> 01:06:58.920
You guys better step back, 'cause it
could get a little exciting in here.

01:07:25.316 --> 01:07:27.079
This is gonna be fun.

01:08:04.455 --> 01:08:05.444
Showtime.

01:08:18.804 --> 01:08:19.792
Okay...

01:08:19.792 --> 01:08:21.930
<i>Samuel. You're on.</i>

01:08:24.076 --> 01:08:25.566
Oh, I'm always on, baby.

01:08:27.779 --> 01:08:29.212
Damn, I'm good.

01:08:35.888 --> 01:08:37.252
Nice work, Samuel.

01:08:37.252 --> 01:08:39.890
Okay, access the account firm
in Greece.

01:08:39.890 --> 01:08:42.825
We're looking for big depositors,
preferably high up in the government.

01:08:43.962 --> 01:08:46.988
- Will the Army Chief of Staff do?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:08:56.908 --> 01:08:58.376
- General.
- Yes?

01:08:58.376 --> 01:09:01.537
A call from South Africa,
they say it's of a personal nature.

01:09:04.716 --> 01:09:06.081
Yes? Who is this?

01:09:06.081 --> 01:09:08.720
The secret number to the account
with my hand on the plug.

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:11.551
At least you'll have known
that at one point, you were very wealthy.

01:09:11.551 --> 01:09:14.354
- If not a little corrupt.
- My deposit safe?

01:09:14.354 --> 01:09:17.555
- Or should I just let the world know now?
- What do you want of me?

01:09:17.555 --> 01:09:19.894
Listen carefully. Act quickly.

01:09:22.769 --> 01:09:25.237
<i>Today's extradition of Kamal Dasan...</i>

01:09:25.237 --> 01:09:28.171
<i>son of Greek billionaire arms dealer,
Ahmet Dasan...</i>

01:09:28.171 --> 01:09:30.573
<i>from Randveld Prison
to Leavenworth, Kansas...</i>

01:09:30.573 --> 01:09:34.272
<i>has been complicated by an invasion
of the high-security facility...</i>

01:09:34.272 --> 01:09:36.781
<i>by a group
officials are labeling mercenaries.</i>

01:09:36.781 --> 01:09:38.249
<i>No word as to whether Dasan...</i>

01:09:38.249 --> 01:09:40.479
So, where the fuck is my son?

01:09:40.479 --> 01:09:43.988
My guess is, boarding a heavily guarded
military flight...

01:09:43.988 --> 01:09:45.991
to Kansas and questioning your love.

01:09:45.991 --> 01:09:50.120
- Are you saying your man betrayed us?
- Yes, it does seem that way.

01:09:50.330 --> 01:09:54.528
I'll tell you what, I'll just keep what's
left of my advance and call it even.

01:09:54.834 --> 01:09:55.823
Cheers.

01:09:55.823 --> 01:09:58.163
<i>If convicted,
Dasan faced life without parole...</i>

01:09:58.163 --> 01:09:59.603
<i>for allegedly assisting his father...</i>

01:09:59.603 --> 01:10:02.141
<i>- Son of a bitch.
...in the transfer of bombs to Al-Qaeda.</i>

01:10:02.141 --> 01:10:04.769
<i>An unspecified number of inmates
have been killed.</i>

01:10:13.343 --> 01:10:16.184
Yes, we shall see
if they have outlived their usefulness.

01:10:16.757 --> 01:10:19.658
- Yeah.
- Hello, John.

01:10:19.658 --> 01:10:21.695
<i>You've truly fucked me on this one,
haven't you?</i>

01:10:21.695 --> 01:10:25.721
You've gone straight to the bank.
You've cost me a lot of money on this one.

01:10:25.721 --> 01:10:27.892
Yeah, well, you win some
and you lose some, Chapel.

01:10:27.892 --> 01:10:29.559
Yes, I know that.

01:10:29.559 --> 01:10:32.834
But you may have offed little Eddie
in the process.

01:10:33.941 --> 01:10:35.875
<i>I'm looking at him right now.</i>

01:10:36.143 --> 01:10:38.077
Oh, he's terrified.

01:10:38.412 --> 01:10:42.041
You know I can find you wherever you are.
Go for it.

01:10:42.041 --> 01:10:43.981
I know that, old boy,
which is precisely why...

01:10:43.981 --> 01:10:46.849
I have a proposition
that will cost you nothing...

01:10:46.849 --> 01:10:48.650
and save little Eddie in the process.

01:10:49.223 --> 01:10:52.090
While you are in the black vault
playing with other people's money...

01:10:52.090 --> 01:10:55.459
do you think that you could find it
in your heart to wire me some?

01:10:55.459 --> 01:10:57.589
In exchange for those two, of course.

01:10:57.589 --> 01:11:00.533
- How do I know you won't kill them?
- Oh, you don't.

01:11:00.735 --> 01:11:03.727
But as you said,
you can find me anywhere.

01:11:03.727 --> 01:11:06.774
- All right, first, proof of life.
- Yes, of course.

01:11:07.509 --> 01:11:11.673
Master Eddie,
say hello to your Uncle John.

01:11:13.214 --> 01:11:15.148
- Hello.
- All right, Eddie. I'll be there.

01:11:15.148 --> 01:11:16.581
Don't you worry, son.

01:11:16.581 --> 01:11:17.709
<i>I will.</i>

01:11:17.709 --> 01:11:19.777
Now, John, I'm not a greedy man.

01:11:20.555 --> 01:11:24.787
But I should think that $100 million
U.S. Dollars would be an appropriate sum.

01:11:24.787 --> 01:11:26.292
I'll get it done.

01:11:26.292 --> 01:11:28.727
Good. Then I should expect it
within the hour.

01:11:32.634 --> 01:11:33.828
And now...

01:11:35.503 --> 01:11:38.666
it is time to say your final goodbyes.

01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:40.100
You lied.

01:11:40.575 --> 01:11:43.135
It's a fib, really. Right, Eddie?

01:11:47.782 --> 01:11:49.546
I prefer apples.

01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:55.218
Mommy?

01:11:55.725 --> 01:11:58.421
- Are we gonna be all right?
- Yes, we are.

01:12:02.498 --> 01:12:04.489
I want a contract out on Chapel so rich...

01:12:04.489 --> 01:12:07.365
even the FBI
will try to collect on it.

01:12:07.737 --> 01:12:10.331
$500 million. Dead.

01:12:11.073 --> 01:12:13.041
Sir, these men are here.

01:12:13.642 --> 01:12:16.577
What? Didn't your checks clear?

01:12:17.113 --> 01:12:18.740
Come with me, you are under arrest.

01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:20.873
What is this about?
Get me the Army Chief of Staff.

01:12:20.873 --> 01:12:22.611
- Yes, sir.
- Bullshit!

01:12:25.888 --> 01:12:27.480
Samuel. We don't have much time.

01:12:30.426 --> 01:12:33.054
We've got company coming in.
You're gonna have to hurry up.

01:12:33.562 --> 01:12:34.756
Okay, shutting down.

01:12:35.998 --> 01:12:37.932
All right, John, the rest is up to you.

01:12:44.274 --> 01:12:46.640
- Are you done?
- Almost.

01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:49.144
There's just one last person
that deserves to be rich.

01:12:52.049 --> 01:12:53.346
You're kidding me.

01:12:57.654 --> 01:12:58.848
John.

01:13:01.558 --> 01:13:04.857
John, John. We got company coming in.

01:13:18.875 --> 01:13:21.901
There was a compromised access code.
I'm not sure, it could be terrorists.

01:13:22.979 --> 01:13:25.345
I received a page
that an access code was issued.

01:13:25.345 --> 01:13:26.973
- What's going on?
- That's the Americans, sir.

01:13:26.973 --> 01:13:29.780
- They're checking the vault for a bomb.
- A bomb? What are you talking about?

01:13:32.289 --> 01:13:33.688
Asshole alert.

01:13:38.963 --> 01:13:40.294
You opened the vault?

01:13:41.332 --> 01:13:43.163
You fucking idiot.

01:13:44.035 --> 01:13:46.560
Arrest them now. Go!

01:13:51.576 --> 01:13:53.373
You're kidding me.

01:13:55.179 --> 01:13:56.305
You're not.

01:14:01.018 --> 01:14:02.110
Wait here.

01:14:03.454 --> 01:14:05.183
- Come with me, sir.
- Yeah.

01:14:28.646 --> 01:14:29.806
Don't shoot!

01:14:39.224 --> 01:14:40.885
Move! Move! Move!

01:14:44.363 --> 01:14:46.160
- The vault below.
- Right! Got it.

01:14:56.842 --> 01:14:58.742
Stop them! Stop them!

01:15:09.755 --> 01:15:10.847
Take them out now!

01:15:57.403 --> 01:15:59.530
Now, you wanted a one-on-one?

01:16:02.308 --> 01:16:03.900
Now, in prison...

01:16:04.744 --> 01:16:08.703
even if you got a lot of money,
you can't spend it.

01:16:09.048 --> 01:16:11.016
Somebody's got some explaining to do.

01:16:11.718 --> 01:16:14.551
I'm afraid you're gonna have
to come with me, sir.

01:16:16.823 --> 01:16:18.256
Ladies first.

01:16:23.430 --> 01:16:24.488
<i>Victim at 329.</i>

01:16:24.488 --> 01:16:25.623
What are they doing?

01:16:25.623 --> 01:16:27.690
<i>Transport by private ambulance.</i>

01:16:30.771 --> 01:16:32.636
- They need you inside.
- All right, sir.

01:16:45.411 --> 01:16:46.714
There you go.

01:16:47.621 --> 01:16:49.816
All right, you know what?
Don't un-cuff her.

01:16:49.816 --> 01:16:51.016
You sure?

01:16:52.826 --> 01:16:53.986
You guys.

01:16:54.795 --> 01:16:56.194
Us guys, we're bad.

01:17:08.309 --> 01:17:09.901
What took you so long?

01:17:30.665 --> 01:17:32.132
Oh, Jesus.

01:17:44.579 --> 01:17:45.568
That's on me.

01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:50.978
$52 million
deposited into your account.

01:17:50.978 --> 01:17:52.881
Now I see why you wanted him so badly.

01:17:54.923 --> 01:17:58.324
You, Mr. Dresham, are under arrest.

01:18:03.131 --> 01:18:04.325
Shall we?

01:18:16.579 --> 01:18:17.876
You hear that shit, man?

01:18:18.581 --> 01:18:21.175
This route will take us directly
to the Botswana border.

01:18:21.175 --> 01:18:23.150
Wait a minute, now,
we got unfinished business.

01:18:24.387 --> 01:18:25.411
They're at the safe house.

01:18:32.027 --> 01:18:35.793
There should be absolutely no mercy.
I want Seeger and all of them dead.

01:18:35.793 --> 01:18:39.232
Now, you're to fetch young Eddie
and Mummy.

01:18:41.670 --> 01:18:43.763
- I never touch a gun.
- Sorry.

01:18:43.763 --> 01:18:44.828
That's your job.

01:18:47.309 --> 01:18:48.298
Idiot.

01:18:49.211 --> 01:18:50.542
Come! Let's go!

01:18:59.355 --> 01:19:01.118
Come on. Get in the car.

01:19:09.433 --> 01:19:11.560
- Stay ready.
- Yes, sir.

01:19:49.339 --> 01:19:52.740
Secure the perimeter.
I don't want anything coming through.

01:19:55.178 --> 01:19:57.170
Keep your hands off my son!

01:20:13.698 --> 01:20:15.097
Straight ahead. Got it?

01:20:16.434 --> 01:20:18.902
Come on, come on, kid.
Stop looking around.

01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:33.539
Stay.

01:20:44.495 --> 01:20:45.519
Keep an eye out.

01:21:31.843 --> 01:21:33.105
I'm going inside the house.

01:21:33.105 --> 01:21:34.941
Take the wheel.
I'll meet you on the other side.

01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:01.834
We've got company.

01:22:06.145 --> 01:22:07.407
Kill them all!

01:22:32.605 --> 01:22:33.833
Bulldog!

01:22:54.695 --> 01:22:58.187
- Where's the boy?
- In the safe house. Southaven.

01:23:07.808 --> 01:23:08.866
Gun!

01:23:23.857 --> 01:23:26.485
- Bummer. Damn.
- Bad parking.

01:24:01.162 --> 01:24:03.096
Sam, you go in around the back.

01:24:03.832 --> 01:24:04.992
Bulldog, you stay here.

01:24:05.667 --> 01:24:06.656
Come with me.

01:24:38.901 --> 01:24:40.596
East perimeter, all clear.

01:25:14.303 --> 01:25:18.467
- Did you hear something?
- I'm not sure. Check it out.

01:25:57.247 --> 01:25:58.236
Hello!

01:26:14.397 --> 01:26:15.456
Get back!

01:26:15.456 --> 01:26:17.524
Leave him alone, he's just a little boy!
He's scared!

01:26:17.524 --> 01:26:20.867
Let him go,
or I'll kill him right here, right now.

01:26:23.307 --> 01:26:24.296
Stay.

01:27:06.050 --> 01:27:09.350
- I really need the bathroom.
- No, you don't.

01:27:10.255 --> 01:27:12.086
You need to stay down there.

01:27:32.711 --> 01:27:35.111
- Are you guys okay?
- Thank God you're here.

01:27:35.111 --> 01:27:36.442
You all right?

01:27:44.122 --> 01:27:46.283
- Watch them for me, will you?
- Okay.

01:27:46.858 --> 01:27:48.951
All right, just hold on a second.

01:27:53.799 --> 01:27:56.097
All right, we'll get you out of here.
Are you okay?

01:27:56.097 --> 01:27:58.102
Yeah. Thanks.

01:28:00.973 --> 01:28:03.465
Hello. Is anyone out there, please?

01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:08.269
Come on.

01:28:09.449 --> 01:28:10.438
Maxine.

01:28:11.851 --> 01:28:15.116
- Bulldog. Take care of Eddie and Shondra.
- This way.

01:28:15.555 --> 01:28:18.752
This is Merc 9. I've got a read on Seeger
in the west garden.

01:28:43.683 --> 01:28:46.049
This just ain't your motherfucking day.

01:28:56.129 --> 01:28:58.291
Chapel here. Do you have a read
on Seeger?

01:28:58.291 --> 01:29:00.492
<i>Hello, is anyone out there, please?</i>

01:29:00.492 --> 01:29:02.034
<i>Hello. Anyone, please.</i>

01:29:05.906 --> 01:29:09.171
Where are the hostages?
A read on Seeger, please.

01:29:09.943 --> 01:29:11.934
<i>Read, please. Anyone there?</i>

01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:13.769
Damn it!

01:29:38.539 --> 01:29:41.599
You have a gun.
You gotta break your own rules, I guess.

01:29:42.109 --> 01:29:45.340
Go ahead. Come on, shoot me down.

01:29:46.847 --> 01:29:49.611
I didn't think so. You know why?

01:29:50.951 --> 01:29:53.386
Yeah, because I'm the
only son of a bitch...

01:29:53.386 --> 01:29:55.923
who could do the things
that you always want getting done.

01:29:56.391 --> 01:29:57.881
And quite right you are, sir.

01:30:00.361 --> 01:30:01.692
I'll see you on the next gig.

01:30:34.896 --> 01:30:36.056
Have you seen Chapel?

01:30:40.301 --> 01:30:42.633
You mean to tell me
you let that milquetoast pussy get away?

01:30:43.471 --> 01:30:44.631
Milquetoast?

01:30:45.608 --> 01:30:48.372
Man, I always thought he had
an explosive personality.

01:30:55.050 --> 01:30:56.108
Oh!

01:31:01.757 --> 01:31:03.349
Isn't that terrible?

01:31:06.295 --> 01:31:09.628
Notice I said "had"
an explosive personality.

01:31:12.168 --> 01:31:13.157
Let's go.

01:31:44.067 --> 01:31:46.399
<i>I promised
I would bring him back...</i>

01:31:47.470 --> 01:31:49.700
<i>with full military honors.</i>

01:31:50.305 --> 01:31:56.378
