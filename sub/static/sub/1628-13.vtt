-ANTON:GQ
-VVhy?

00:04.338 --> 00:06.329
Because you could've killed me
and you didn't.

00:06.424 --> 00:09.666
When I pour this potion
onto the object I hold most dear,

00:10.052 --> 00:11.758
that object becomes a talisman

00:11.846 --> 00:14.838
that allows me to cross the town line
and still remember who / am.

00:14.932 --> 00:16.342
Now you can find your son.

00:17.685 --> 00:19.016
(GROANS)

00:19.103 --> 00:20.764
-Be||e!
-Who's Belle?

00:20.855 --> 00:22.345
Now you finally know how it feels!

(TIRES SCREECHING)

00:25.359 --> 00:26.439
CORA: What do you want?

00:26.569 --> 00:27.684
REGINA: My son back.

00:27.778 --> 00:28.858
Let me into your heart.

00:28.946 --> 00:31.198
Together we can get
him back again.

00:37.705 --> 00:39.787
-Ready to go, Ms. Swan?
-A|most. (SIGHS)

00:41.959 --> 00:44.621
Do you think we'll be cold
where we're going? Or warm?

00:44.754 --> 00:46.460
I think layers are always a good idea.

00:46.589 --> 00:49.547
I thought the terms of our agreement
were quite clear.

00:49.634 --> 00:52.046
You owe me a favor. You alone.

00:52.136 --> 00:53.967
I'm not leaving Henry here
with Cora lurking about.

00:54.055 --> 00:56.216
So either we both go or we both stay.

00:58.809 --> 01:01.471
Then we'll have to purchase
another plane ticket, won't we?

01:02.230 --> 01:03.219
Wait, we're flying?

01:03.314 --> 01:06.147
Don't worry, l'm covering expenses,
even the new ones.

01:06.234 --> 01:07.644
You're a real gentleman, aren't you?

01:09.820 --> 01:11.981
All right, Gold,
you're going out there with my family,

01:12.114 --> 01:13.650
just know if anything
happens to them, I'll...

01:13.741 --> 01:14.730
Then you'll what?

01:14.825 --> 01:16.326
Cross the town line

01:16.410 --> 01:18.822
and David Nolan will hunt me down
in his animal rescue van?

01:18.913 --> 01:20.778
I'll be devastated.

01:21.624 --> 01:23.910
This isn't a threat. It's a request.

01:24.252 --> 01:25.867
(WHISPERS) Take care of them.

01:27.004 --> 01:29.586
I promise no harm will come
to your family.

01:29.674 --> 01:32.837
After all, we have a deal.

01:36.722 --> 01:39.964
-So, where are we going?
-Logan International Airport.

01:40.059 --> 01:41.674
I think he meant after that.

01:41.769 --> 01:44.511
Let's just take things
one step at a time, shall we?

01:47.900 --> 01:50.107
You really think
that shawl's gonna work?

01:50.194 --> 01:54.107
Well, if it doesn't
and l revert to my cursed self,

01:54.198 --> 01:56.280
we're all going to have some problems.

01:59.537 --> 02:00.697
It will work.

02:12.800 --> 02:13.789
So?

02:16.304 --> 02:18.420
My name is Rumplestiltskin.

02:20.725 --> 02:23.216
And we're going to find my son.

02:34.155 --> 02:35.486
(SIGHS)

02:35.990 --> 02:38.402
-You like the holster, huh?
-(CHUCKLES)

02:39.577 --> 02:41.533
I miss carrying a sword.

02:41.620 --> 02:43.121
Well, it looks good on you.

02:43.247 --> 02:46.284
Come on.
Leroy has the dwarfs on Cora watch.

02:46.417 --> 02:48.078
They've got eyes everywhere.
But they could use our help.

02:48.502 --> 02:49.537
Really?

02:49.628 --> 02:53.246
How hard can it be to find
a powerful sorceress in a small town?

02:56.510 --> 02:58.421
Uh, apparently, not very hard.

02:58.512 --> 02:59.922
Regina? You're back.

03:00.014 --> 03:03.472
I know you think I'm responsible for
poor Dr. Hopper's death...

03:03.601 --> 03:05.592
He's alive.

03:05.978 --> 03:07.093
What?

03:07.521 --> 03:08.772
You were framed.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.312
Who would do that?

03:10.441 --> 03:11.396
Your mother.

03:11.484 --> 03:13.099
She's here.

03:13.194 --> 03:15.230
(STUTTERS) But that's not possible.

03:15.321 --> 03:17.607
When we found a way back, so did she.

03:18.366 --> 03:19.355
(SIGHS)

03:19.450 --> 03:23.784
We were wrong. And we're so sorry.

03:24.455 --> 03:25.615
I know.

03:25.706 --> 03:28.322
But if Cora's here,
then we're all in danger.

03:28.459 --> 03:30.120
Please, you have to let me see my son.

03:30.211 --> 03:31.451
I can protect him.

03:32.421 --> 03:33.456
He's not here.

03:34.965 --> 03:36.045
What?

03:36.133 --> 03:38.590
Mr. Gold asked Emma
to help him find his son.

03:38.969 --> 03:41.346
They left town
about an hour ago with Henry.

03:41.472 --> 03:42.632
And no one told me?

03:43.808 --> 03:45.173
We didn't know where you were.

03:45.768 --> 03:46.883
And to be honest, Regina,

03:46.977 --> 03:49.935
I don't think Emma
has to run anything by you.

03:52.149 --> 03:55.312
No, I suppose she doesn't.

03:59.573 --> 04:00.562
(SIGHS)

04:00.658 --> 04:01.693
That went well.

04:01.826 --> 04:04.158
With her, it doesn't get much better.

04:04.662 --> 04:06.994
Come on, let's go find Cora.

04:07.123 --> 04:09.990
-Where?
-No idea.

04:10.126 --> 04:12.708
But I know who to ask.

04:13.629 --> 04:15.039
(GROANS)

04:16.048 --> 04:18.630
You didn't even ask me
about my recovery.

04:18.717 --> 04:20.173
(MARY CHUCKLES)

04:21.011 --> 04:22.512
How are you feeling, Hook?

04:22.638 --> 04:24.674
Come closer and feel for yourself.
(GRUNTS)

04:24.807 --> 04:27.389
You wanna lose the other hand?
Where's the ship?

04:27.852 --> 04:31.060
Come on, Archie told us.
It's shielded somehow. Isn't it, mate?

04:31.730 --> 04:34.938
Aye. That it is.

04:35.025 --> 04:37.516
Follow me.

04:37.653 --> 04:40.190
I don't know what you expect to find.
Cora won't be there.

04:40.322 --> 04:42.984
Well, maybe she left something behind
that will tell us where she went.

04:43.075 --> 04:44.155
Let's go.

04:44.243 --> 04:47.531
And no funny business.
I'm watching you, pirate.

04:47.663 --> 04:52.282
Yes, dwarf, that should deter me
from any malfeasance.

04:52.376 --> 04:54.116
Oh, don't worry, Leroy, he'll help us.

04:54.211 --> 04:55.667
What makes you so sure?

04:55.754 --> 04:59.246
Because you're a pirate.
You know which way the wind blows.

04:59.383 --> 05:04.002
And right now, it is gusting towards us.

05:04.305 --> 05:05.636
Oh.

05:06.390 --> 05:09.006
| see where your daughter
got her gumption.

05:10.769 --> 05:12.725
Follow me.

05:14.231 --> 05:15.482
(GROANS)

05:27.578 --> 05:29.910
You sailed this ship from our land.

05:31.749 --> 05:33.410
Could you sail it back?

05:34.126 --> 05:37.414
My ship? She's a marvel.

05:37.963 --> 05:40.170
Made from enchanted wood.

05:40.257 --> 05:42.373
We've weathered
many a storm together,

05:42.468 --> 05:46.928
seen many strange, glittering shores.

05:47.056 --> 05:51.766
But to travel between lands,
she must go through a portal.

05:51.894 --> 05:54.260
Yeah, what do you know
about Cora's plans?

05:54.813 --> 05:57.145
Cora's not the most
communicative of lasses.

05:57.816 --> 06:00.102
But I will tell you this.

06:00.236 --> 06:04.730
Whatever malice she has in mind,
her weapon of choice is in here.

06:16.293 --> 06:17.999
Who's that?

06:18.087 --> 06:19.668
(BELL TOLLING)

06:19.755 --> 06:21.996

06:23.467 --> 06:25.003
Ah.

06:25.302 --> 06:26.508
You're late, Tiny.

06:26.637 --> 06:28.423
Missed you out in the fields, Tiny.

06:28.514 --> 06:29.799
lt's Anton.

06:31.350 --> 06:33.466
(CHUCKLES) But you're just
so damn tiny, Tiny.

06:33.644 --> 06:35.976
All right, enough squabbling, enough.

06:36.105 --> 06:37.936
Today, we celebrate.

06:38.482 --> 06:40.313
After a century of hard labor,

06:40.943 --> 06:43.980
the time of the bean harvest
has finally arrived.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.232
(CHEERING)

06:46.323 --> 06:47.529
Yay.

06:47.658 --> 06:50.115
But is a blossom more than its root?

06:50.619 --> 06:53.361
Is a harvest more important
than a hard day's work?

06:53.998 --> 06:56.785
No. Each has value.

06:56.875 --> 07:00.493
Just as each of us has value.

07:01.714 --> 07:03.454
-Hear, hear.
-ALL: Hear, hear.

07:03.841 --> 07:05.172
(CLANGING)

07:08.345 --> 07:10.927
You've been spending time in
the treasure room again, haven't you?

07:11.181 --> 07:12.261
No.

07:13.517 --> 07:14.848
Maybe.

07:15.644 --> 07:17.100
So say that l was. So what?

07:17.187 --> 07:21.021
Your fascination with the humans
and their artifacts is misguided.

07:21.108 --> 07:22.348
No good can come of it.

07:22.443 --> 07:23.933
How can you say that?

07:24.028 --> 07:25.859
When you've never even
been to their world.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.857
And you won't even
let any of us go down there.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.030
Have you forgotten
what the humans did?

07:30.367 --> 07:33.109
Why we no longer
trade beans with them?

07:33.203 --> 07:36.240
They weren't content
merely traveling between the realms.

07:36.332 --> 07:38.573
They had to conquer and pillage.

07:38.667 --> 07:40.703
Just because a few humans
did some bad stuff

07:40.794 --> 07:42.125
doesn't make them all evil.

07:42.212 --> 07:46.751
They don't abide by
the same laws that we do, Anton.

07:47.468 --> 07:49.424
We giants foster life.

07:49.511 --> 07:51.888
They destroy it.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.884
That is why they must never know
that we still exist,

07:54.975 --> 07:57.352
or that we still grow the beans.

07:57.436 --> 08:02.476
But why do we keep growing them
if nobody ever uses them?

08:08.238 --> 08:09.569
It's what we do.

08:09.657 --> 08:11.613
We don't do anything with them.

08:11.700 --> 08:15.864
It is the labor that makes us who we are,

08:15.954 --> 08:18.286
not the fruit that it yields.

08:20.918 --> 08:24.502
-What is this? A human toy?
-Put it down.

08:24.588 --> 08:25.577
(CLANKING)

08:28.008 --> 08:29.464
Not much fun, is it?

08:29.551 --> 08:32.133
Abraham, that is enough.

08:33.347 --> 08:34.883
(INDISTINCT MURMURING)

08:35.808 --> 08:37.344
-Tiny!
-Tiny!

09:05.129 --> 09:08.371
So Cora used magic
to make him travel-sized?

09:08.465 --> 09:11.923
Whatever she intends to do with him,
it's important.

09:12.010 --> 09:14.922
Oh, I think you know
exactly what she intends.

09:15.013 --> 09:16.423
You're holding out.

09:16.515 --> 09:18.346
Well, either have your lovely wife
torture it out of me,

09:18.434 --> 09:20.470
which I promise will be fun for both...

09:20.561 --> 09:22.017
Why don't you and l have some fun?

09:22.104 --> 09:23.810
I don't know what she's planning.

09:23.897 --> 09:28.436
Why don't you wake the bloody giant
and ask him yourself?

09:51.675 --> 09:53.586
Anton. Where's that witch?

09:53.677 --> 09:55.133
She's gone.

09:56.221 --> 09:59.054
What did she do? She made me small!

I didn't! You'll pay for your evil!

I'm sorry, no, I don't.

11:07.960 --> 11:12.795
Anyway, I thought you could
use some comforts from home.

11:12.881 --> 11:15.258
You were always
telling me about Jules Verne,

11:15.342 --> 11:18.834

The Mysterious Island.

11:24.101 --> 11:25.966
Thank you.

11:26.979 --> 11:28.264
Were...

11:28.355 --> 11:30.437
Were we really friends?

11:31.066 --> 11:32.431
Yeah, we were.

11:34.278 --> 11:35.688
Then, tell me the truth.

11:35.779 --> 11:37.861
Before I was brought here, l was hurt.

11:37.948 --> 11:41.156
l was bleeding. And then this man came

11:41.702 --> 11:44.694
(STAMMERING) and he healed me.

11:44.788 --> 11:49.122

hold a ball of fire in his hands.

How is that possible?

can give you wicked nightmares...

12:10.147 --> 12:13.264

12:29.625 --> 12:31.991
Well, then, rest up.

12:32.085 --> 12:36.749
The sooner you're better, the sooner
you can be out of our quiet little town.

12:41.887 --> 12:43.252
David,

12:44.306 --> 12:47.594
did that giant just say
he'll "make you pay"?

12:48.894 --> 12:49.883
For what?

12:49.978 --> 12:51.843
l have no idea.
I've never seen that guy before.

12:51.939 --> 12:53.520
Well, he sure knows you.

12:57.653 --> 12:59.689
No. It's not about me.

13:01.573 --> 13:03.859
He just thinks it is.

13:11.959 --> 13:14.826
You are a true wonder.

13:16.421 --> 13:18.161
-I know.
-(CHUCKLES)

13:28.809 --> 13:30.174
I didn't know you had company, James.

13:30.894 --> 13:34.978
Father! This is my father, the King.
Father, this is...

13:35.065 --> 13:36.100
I don't care.

13:36.233 --> 13:38.144
The kingdom is teetering
on bankruptcy,

13:38.235 --> 13:40.977
the name of your latest dalliance
is of little concern to me.

13:41.446 --> 13:44.153
Pleasure to meet you, too,
Your Majesty.

13:44.241 --> 13:45.321
Good day.

13:45.951 --> 13:47.157
Care for a drink, Father?

13:47.244 --> 13:48.484
GEORGE:
There will be time for that later.

13:48.578 --> 13:50.318
Right now, there's trouble afoot.

13:50.414 --> 13:53.531
| just received word that there's a giant
running amok in the outer village.

13:53.625 --> 13:56.162
I thought giants were extinct?

13:56.253 --> 13:57.914
I'd love the chance to battle one.

13:58.005 --> 13:59.336
No. No killing.

13:59.423 --> 14:01.038
Not yet anyway.

14:01.133 --> 14:02.964
This giant could be of use to us.

14:03.593 --> 14:05.129
Just tell me what needs to be done.

14:07.055 --> 14:08.340
MARY: Your brother.

14:08.432 --> 14:10.263
That's who he thinks you are.

14:10.350 --> 14:13.012
-lt's the only thing that makes sense.
-(SlGHS)

14:13.270 --> 14:14.305
Come on.

14:15.814 --> 14:16.849
Where are we going?

14:16.940 --> 14:19.431
To find outjust what kind of trouble
my brother got himself into.

14:19.526 --> 14:22.689
Leroy, get your head looked at,
then gather the dwarfs.

14:22.779 --> 14:25.771
You need to keep an eye out
for this giant.

14:25.866 --> 14:28.608
(RAUCOUS LAUGHTER)

14:43.675 --> 14:46.337
JAMES:
If you want some ale, you should ask!

14:46.970 --> 14:50.007
They'll serve anyone who can pay,
my friend. (CHUCKLES)

14:51.975 --> 14:53.966
l'm James, prince of this realm.

14:54.978 --> 14:57.845
I wanted to make sure
you received a warm welcome.

14:57.981 --> 15:01.473
-l'm Anton. I'm a giant.
-(LAUGHS)

15:01.902 --> 15:03.893
Yeah, I can see that.

15:03.987 --> 15:05.648
What brings you to our land?

15:05.739 --> 15:08.902
I've always been fascinated
with your customs.

15:08.992 --> 15:11.324
| just wanted to see it for myself.

15:11.411 --> 15:15.370
Well, we would be more than happy
to show you around.

15:16.500 --> 15:20.038
Of course,
there's the matter of your size.

15:20.170 --> 15:23.003
I'm too small for back home,
I'm too big for here.

15:23.090 --> 15:26.878
Don't despair, Anton.
l have something that may help you.

15:27.594 --> 15:28.709
What is it?

15:29.846 --> 15:30.961
Magic.

15:31.056 --> 15:33.638
A piece of mushroom from a far-off land.

15:33.725 --> 15:36.558
I once slayed a JabbenNock
that was terrorizing a village.

15:36.686 --> 15:41.020
And they couldn't pay me in gold,
so they paid me with this instead.

15:41.399 --> 15:44.857
If you eat it, it will change your size.

15:45.403 --> 15:48.190
lts effects are temporary,
but we have more.

15:52.202 --> 15:53.692
I'm pretty sure
this one makes you smaller.

15:53.787 --> 15:54.867
Pretty sure?

15:55.372 --> 15:57.784
Well, I haven't had the occasion to try it.

15:57.874 --> 16:00.786
But the wise woman who gave it to me
swore by its power.

16:00.877 --> 16:02.742
Go on, Anton, give it a try.

16:03.380 --> 16:05.587
l have no way to repay you
for your kindness.

16:05.715 --> 16:06.966
No need.

16:07.050 --> 16:10.668
If it makes you happy,
that's all the payment that we desire.

16:10.762 --> 16:12.718
Well, then, at least tell me your name.

16:13.765 --> 16:14.754
JacqueHne.

16:17.227 --> 16:19.718
But most people call me Jack.

16:21.398 --> 16:22.513
Nice to meet you, Jack.

16:28.989 --> 16:31.230
(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

16:38.748 --> 16:40.249

16:43.628 --> 16:46.085
Have you ever been outside of
Storybrooke before, Mr. Gold?

16:47.257 --> 16:48.337
No.

16:48.425 --> 16:49.414
Are you nervous?

16:49.509 --> 16:50.794
No.

16:50.886 --> 16:52.296
Are you worried about
meeting your son?

16:52.387 --> 16:53.376
No, Henry. I'm fine.

16:53.471 --> 16:55.462
How about we talk about
all this later, kid?

16:55.599 --> 16:56.634
We're next.

16:56.766 --> 16:59.098
It must be really hard not to use magic.

16:59.227 --> 17:00.603
Being like everyone else.

17:04.441 --> 17:05.931
You gotta put your shoes in.

17:07.819 --> 17:09.775
How terribly uncivilized.

17:13.325 --> 17:14.485
Uh, scarf and cane go in the basket.

17:14.910 --> 17:15.899
What?

17:15.994 --> 17:18.076
Scarf and cane go in the basket.

17:19.331 --> 17:20.867
I can't.

17:20.957 --> 17:22.288
(SOFTLY) You have to.

17:24.002 --> 17:25.162
You ever been on a plane before?

17:25.295 --> 17:27.581
Have you ever been
impaled upon a cane before?

17:27.672 --> 17:29.879
My father's a little nervous.

17:29.966 --> 17:32.252
We're headed to
a family reunion. Sorry.

17:32.344 --> 17:33.459
Father?

17:33.553 --> 17:35.965
Just put your shawl in the bin.
I'll help you get through.

17:36.056 --> 17:38.092
lfl let this go, I could forget who I am.

17:38.183 --> 17:40.299
I'm not gonna let that happen.

Hello, Hook.

18:52.882 --> 18:54.167
Regina.

18:54.259 --> 18:57.877
Expecting my mother?
The one you were supposed to kill?

18:58.888 --> 19:01.049
Oh, that.

19:01.182 --> 19:03.889
Well, I didn't want to deprive you
of a happy reunion.

19:04.019 --> 19:08.262
Well, it's your lucky day.
She and I have made amends.

19:08.398 --> 19:11.105
And you're here to thank me?
How sweet.

19:11.234 --> 19:12.895
She wants to know
if they found the ship.

19:13.028 --> 19:14.939
Well, you can tell her
she can ask me herself.

19:15.071 --> 19:18.438
She decided it wouldn't be prudent
for her to be out and about.

19:18.908 --> 19:21.570
Well, then, it is my lucky day.

19:22.620 --> 19:24.611
And you can tell her
they found the ship.

19:24.748 --> 19:26.113
But did you get her things off it?

19:26.249 --> 19:28.831
I've been tied up in bed.
Not in the good way.

19:28.918 --> 19:30.499
She needs her things.

19:30.587 --> 19:32.999
Oh, I bet she does.

19:33.089 --> 19:35.250
Well, there's good news, then.

19:35.383 --> 19:37.760
A giant got loose from the hold.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.345
You lost a giant?

19:39.429 --> 19:40.669
Well, a shrunken giant.

19:40.764 --> 19:42.004
How is that good news?

19:42.098 --> 19:45.010
Because, when he got free,

19:45.101 --> 19:50.266
he took one look at the Prince
and became extremely murderous.

19:50.440 --> 19:51.850
Hmm.

19:53.234 --> 19:56.567
A giant in town
who wants to kill the Prince.

19:58.114 --> 20:00.446
This is just the distraction we need.

20:00.575 --> 20:02.281
That it is, dear.

I'm not so sure about
this family of yours, Anton.

20:39.155 --> 20:41.237
It doesn't sound like
they appreciate you.

20:41.324 --> 20:42.404
They're not so bad.

20:44.077 --> 20:47.569
Except for the making fun of me,

20:48.164 --> 20:49.825
and the pushing me around,

20:51.251 --> 20:52.832
the harsh words.

Sometimes you have to leave home
to find the people

20:58.842 --> 21:01.925
you truly belong with.

21:05.181 --> 21:06.682
Your real family.

21:08.101 --> 21:10.843
It's like you were always
meant to be here, Anton.

21:17.193 --> 21:21.357
Now, make sure our Anton
has all that he needs.

21:29.539 --> 21:30.904
I had one of those once.

21:33.001 --> 21:35.663
I never knew it made
such beautiful music.

21:38.590 --> 21:41.206
My brothers are
so wrong about humans.

21:41.342 --> 21:44.550
MAN 1: That is unacceptable!
Go back there and tell them what I said.

21:45.138 --> 21:46.173
Promise them anything.

21:47.015 --> 21:48.880
Is there a problem?

21:49.392 --> 21:50.802
He didn't tell you, did he?

21:53.855 --> 21:56.062
The royal coffers are empty.

21:56.149 --> 21:59.357
James and his father are deeply in debt
to a neighboring kingdom.

21:59.444 --> 22:00.775
I don't understand.

22:00.862 --> 22:02.773
If James can't pay back what he owes,

22:02.864 --> 22:05.480
they'll plunder this realm
and burn it to the ground.

22:06.534 --> 22:08.820
-Now I understand.
-It's bad.

22:09.746 --> 22:12.328
Will the other kingdom
only accept gold coins?

22:12.415 --> 22:13.746
Well, it depends.

22:13.833 --> 22:16.415
A magic bean, for instance,
would be worth a thousand coins.

22:16.503 --> 22:19.336
But you don't have
any of those back home,

22:19.422 --> 22:20.923
do you?

22:21.007 --> 22:24.295
No. No beans.

22:24.385 --> 22:25.886
We do have treasure.

22:25.970 --> 22:27.961
Enough to pay off your debts, I bet.

22:28.056 --> 22:29.091
You would help us?

it's a nice kingdom and not,

I'm here to help you.

22:57.752 --> 23:02.166
No. You're human. I hate humans.

23:03.967 --> 23:05.958

He was raised by a ruthless king.

No.

for his arrogance.

27:47.917 --> 27:48.997

-Uh-huh.

40:35.684 --> 40:37.174
-Yeah.
-(CHUCKLES)

40:37.644 --> 40:39.805
I missed our adventures.

40:41.356 --> 40:42.345
Me, too.

40:43.358 --> 40:45.735
(LAUGHS) It was kind of fun.

40:48.530 --> 40:50.691
You know, we could do this all the time.

40:51.700 --> 40:52.860
When the beans grow,

40:52.993 --> 40:56.030
we could go back,
everyone could go home.

40:57.331 --> 40:58.821
I don't know.

40:59.374 --> 41:00.580
What don't you know?

41:00.709 --> 41:02.870
Home is where our family is.

41:03.920 --> 41:06.206
And that's here.

41:08.425 --> 41:10.131
I don't know
if Emma would come with us.

41:10.218 --> 41:13.255
And I am not going to be
separated from her again.

41:14.056 --> 41:16.172
-You're worried about her.
-Aren't you?

41:16.266 --> 41:19.224
Of course. (SIGHS) But Emma...

41:19.895 --> 41:21.385
Emma can take care of herself.

41:21.521 --> 41:26.561
And I'm sure wherever
she and Henry are, they're safe.

41:34.785 --> 41:35.991
You good, kid?

41:36.078 --> 41:39.787
You kidding? A trip with you,
first plane ride,

41:39.915 --> 41:42.156
and we're going on a quest
like in the book?

41:42.250 --> 41:45.333
The only thing that could
make this day better

41:45.420 --> 41:47.035
is more frosting.

41:59.976 --> 42:03.889
It's gonna be all right.
We're gonna find your son.

42:05.565 --> 42:07.066
I know.

42:08.443 --> 42:11.810
WOMAN OVER PA: Welcome, folks,
to Ajira Airlines Regional Flight 53,

42:11.947 --> 42:14.313
with nonstop service to New York City.

42:14.449 --> 42:16.986
Our flight time tonight is 42 minutes.

42:17.119 --> 42:20.611
Please sit back, relax,
and enjoy the ride.
