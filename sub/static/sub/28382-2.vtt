22:43.845 --> 22:45.637

22:45.720 --> 22:47.261
Do you have insurance,
and if so,

22:47.345 --> 22:48.929
would you be the primary?

22:49.011 --> 22:51.303
No, it's my mama.

22:52.762 --> 22:54.970
What about transportation?
How do you get around?

when I can see my son.

23:03.887 --> 23:06.512
Okay, again, that is not
what we do here.

23:06.595 --> 23:08.470
Once you prove temporary
financial support,

23:08.553 --> 23:10.470
you receive a court date,

23:10.553 --> 23:12.970
at which point a judge
will issue a permanent order.

23:13.053 --> 23:15.929
At that point, you can address
custody and visitation.

23:16.011 --> 23:17.804
So what you're saying...

23:17.887 --> 23:20.053
I gotta pay for my son...

23:20.136 --> 23:22.220
