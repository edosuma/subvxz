WEBVTT

00:05.800 --> 00:07.976
 There's a storm in a far right
 teacup brewing here.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.096
 How old is he?

00:09.120 --> 00:10.616
 Supposed to be a full moon tonight

00:10.640 --> 00:12.536
 and I've got my knickers
 on back to front.

00:12.560 --> 00:14.336
 They're usually both bad omens.

00:14.360 --> 00:18.016
 Ma'am, this isn't some sort
 of neo-Nazi fetish picnic.

00:18.040 --> 00:19.576
 This is a lynch mob.

00:19.600 --> 00:22.136
 If you don't authorise some backup,
 you can tell the mayor

00:22.160 --> 00:26.160
 that I'm billing him for a water
 cannon. Thank you, ma'am.

00:29.240 --> 00:32.256
- Jesus, Spike.
- Ma'am, we're still waiting on the mayor.

00:32.280 --> 00:34.376
 You sure you don't want to take
 him in round the back?

00:34.400 --> 00:36.496
 They bark, we bite.
 Are the candidates all inside?

00:36.520 --> 00:39.376
 Apart from McCoy. She won't budge.
 Said she wanted to wait for you.

00:39.400 --> 00:40.536
 Viv, I know I'm pushing it,

00:40.560 --> 00:43.336
 but there's no way I'm getting
 snapped going in with those mugs.

00:43.360 --> 00:44.696
 I'll look like John Prescott.

00:44.720 --> 00:47.336
 You won't be going anywhere if you
 don't do as I say, Miss McCoy.

00:47.360 --> 00:48.616
 I look all right though, yeah?

00:48.640 --> 00:50.896
 What, I can't even get a compliment?

00:50.920 --> 00:51.976
 I've been up since four.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.216
 I've done two sports centres,
 a synagogue, one Polish church

00:55.240 --> 00:56.576
 and two mosques.

00:56.600 --> 00:58.816
 Guess how many selfies
 I've been asked for? Two.

00:58.840 --> 01:00.456
 How untweetably lonely's that?

01:00.480 --> 01:04.480
 Ma'am, he's in.

01:05.720 --> 01:08.336
 I'd like to say, may the best man
 win.

01:08.360 --> 01:10.216
 Ding ding, come on.
 Save it for the ring.

01:10.240 --> 01:11.536
 Go home!

01:11.560 --> 01:12.856
 Get them inside!

01:12.880 --> 01:14.736
 Get them in!

01:14.760 --> 01:16.576
 Don't touch her. She's diabetic.

01:16.600 --> 01:18.176
 Watch your back!

01:18.200 --> 01:20.736
 We're not going anywhere!

01:20.760 --> 01:24.760
 Move, get out of the way! Move!
 Excuse me.

01:25.960 --> 01:27.736
 You call this security, Inspector?

01:27.760 --> 01:29.296
 Come on, show a bit
 of Dunkirk spirit.

01:29.320 --> 01:31.216
 I want all drinks
 containers confiscated.

01:31.240 --> 01:33.096
 Plastic cups, the lot.

01:33.120 --> 01:34.536
 Be strip searches next.

01:34.560 --> 01:35.976
 Dream on.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.696
 Political hustings are normally
 done by about tennish, right?

01:38.720 --> 01:40.616
 Yeah, but ten is when the free drink
 comes out,

01:40.640 --> 01:43.616
 so we'll probably be mopping
 up till midnight.

01:43.640 --> 01:44.416
 Why?

01:46.440 --> 01:47.736
 I've got a date.

01:47.760 --> 01:49.416
 We've been chatting on Skype
 for hours

01:49.440 --> 01:52.256
 and he still wants to meet me.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.576
 And he's travelling business.

01:54.600 --> 01:55.896
 He's only flipping FBI.

01:55.920 --> 01:57.176
 He's cashing in his air miles.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.336
 And with his kind of access

01:58.360 --> 02:01.216
 there isn't anything he won't know
 about me, Dinah.

02:01.240 --> 02:04.456
 God, I can't tell you how much
 that makes me want to cry,

02:04.480 --> 02:08.295
 because he's still coming.
 Yeah, he arrives tonight, 11pm GMT.

02:08.320 --> 02:09.735
 Go meet him at the airport.

02:09.759 --> 02:13.616
 Get a hotel.  No! I can't. Ma'am
 needs us here. We're outgunned.

02:13.640 --> 02:17.616
 I'll cover for you. Ditch
 the head girl thing and get some.

02:17.640 --> 02:18.976
 No!

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
 He's going to have to wait.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.456
 Oh, girls.
 Viv, really, it'll be fine.

02:25.480 --> 02:27.216
 I'll wear it like a badge of honour.

02:27.240 --> 02:29.136
 If some troll sees that
 you've dribbled squash

02:29.160 --> 02:31.616
 down your front, they'll tweet
 that you've got Parkinson's.

02:31.640 --> 02:35.640
 I'd lend you mine but you haven't
 the bust. Take your pick.

02:35.760 --> 02:38.216
 Joy, would you mind?

02:38.240 --> 02:40.176
 Er, no!  Ma'am.

02:40.200 --> 02:42.736
 All drinks containers have
 been confiscated.  What?

02:42.760 --> 02:45.416
 I thought you said out
 there was nothing to worry about.

02:45.440 --> 02:46.936
 Relax.

02:46.960 --> 02:48.256
 We've got your back.

02:48.280 --> 02:50.296
 It's your votes I'm after.

02:50.320 --> 02:52.656
 Ta.

02:52.680 --> 02:53.896
 Come on.

02:55.920 --> 02:58.936
 A black girl in the far right?
 Is that even possible?

02:58.960 --> 03:01.416
 I want them shifted.

03:01.440 --> 03:04.216
 Viv, bundling their one black woman
 into a van in front of the camera

03:04.240 --> 03:06.976
 is exactly what they want us to do.
 They threw squash on the way in.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.656
 What's to say there's not
 acid on the way out?

03:09.680 --> 03:10.776
 Hang on.

03:11.800 --> 03:15.800
 They didn't see me, did they?

03:17.000 --> 03:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:24.560 --> 03:26.056
 Right, spoke to the producer.

03:26.080 --> 03:28.856
 Can't get you 100
 but I can get you 50 each.

03:28.880 --> 03:30.776
 Oh. Wrong heads, bye-bye.

03:30.800 --> 03:33.256
 50 for what?

03:33.280 --> 03:34.936
 Who are you with?

03:34.960 --> 03:35.980
 Sorry.

03:36.440 --> 03:37.616
 Lydia Hopkirk.

03:37.640 --> 03:38.816
 We're piloting a new format

03:38.840 --> 03:42.336
 that doesn't kowtow to liberal
 mainstream agendas.

03:42.360 --> 03:44.376
 What's it called?

03:44.400 --> 03:46.296
 Er, Rock The Boat.

03:46.320 --> 03:48.016
 We're looking for new faces,

03:48.040 --> 03:50.336
 and your face would really
 fit the bill.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.776
 Cuff her for assault.
 Don't you fucking dare!

03:52.800 --> 03:54.416
 Want my crew to film you lot

03:54.440 --> 03:58.440
 cuffing the only black woman
 at a far right rally? Well, do you?

04:00.200 --> 04:04.200
 Get out of here.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.016
 Pigs.

04:08.040 --> 04:10.656
 50 quid for vox pops, you said?

04:10.680 --> 04:12.056
 Yeah.

04:12.080 --> 04:14.936
 Just this way.

04:14.960 --> 04:16.935
 Right, we're going to shoot
 you down here

04:16.959 --> 04:20.495
 so the crew can control the lighting
 and the sound, for obvious reasons.

04:20.519 --> 04:23.416
 So where is the crew?

04:23.440 --> 04:25.296
 I think, er...

04:27.320 --> 04:31.136
 Have none of you ever been on a
 professional fucking set before?

04:31.160 --> 04:34.416
 And you? I said I wanted derelict
 as a background, not tetanus.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.936
 Hey, don't talk to her like that,
 you wonky-eyed prick.

04:36.960 --> 04:40.176
 Well, I'm the one who decides
 who is camera-ready or not

04:40.200 --> 04:41.736
 from where I'm standing,

04:41.760 --> 04:43.896
 and I wouldn't talk to me
 like that either.

04:43.920 --> 04:47.416
 Right, don't care if you signed
 spunk monkey or not,

04:47.440 --> 04:51.440
 just need signatures, otherwise
 petty or not, there'll be no cash.

04:51.600 --> 04:55.600
 Right, just going to nip to the van
 to get the wages. Back in a tick.

05:01.080 --> 05:05.080
 Fucking mental! Hats off.

05:23.720 --> 05:25.696
 Then you need to let me finish.

05:25.720 --> 05:27.416
 You've said that three times already

05:27.440 --> 05:31.056
 and you've still not got
 to the point, so no.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.336
 They're wrapping up.

05:32.360 --> 05:33.896
 I want to keep all exits clear.

05:33.920 --> 05:36.656
 Joy, you come up front.
 Dinah, head to the bar.

05:36.680 --> 05:40.656
 If he wants to know how public cuts
 affect our frontline services,

05:40.680 --> 05:42.776
 then let's hear it from the
 horse's mouth.

05:42.800 --> 05:46.800
 That wonderful woman standing right
 there, Inspector Viv Dearing.

05:47.720 --> 05:49.496
 Come on, Viv.

05:49.520 --> 05:51.056
 Come on.

05:51.080 --> 05:55.080
 She went to school with my mum.

05:55.440 --> 05:58.616
 Come on, Viv.

05:58.640 --> 06:01.256
 If you want your facts direct
 tonight,

06:01.280 --> 06:05.280
 let's get that wonderful woman up
 here on this stage. Come on.

06:05.760 --> 06:07.856
 Jane, this is a debate
 for mayoral candidate.

06:07.880 --> 06:10.416
 Inspector Dearing, can you deny

06:10.440 --> 06:13.736
 that the mayor's cuts
 have crippled your police force?

06:13.760 --> 06:16.136
 Don't do it, ma'am.

06:16.160 --> 06:20.160
 This is a democratic forum
 for elected and electable people.

06:21.960 --> 06:25.816
 It's not for civil servants like me.

06:25.840 --> 06:27.176
 Well done, ma'am.

06:27.200 --> 06:29.816
Proud of you.

06:29.840 --> 06:33.840
 Inspector! Inspector!
 Inspector! Come on.

06:34.720 --> 06:37.376
Inspector! Inspector!

06:37.400 --> 06:41.400
 Come on!

06:41.480 --> 06:43.376
 OK.

06:43.400 --> 06:46.016
 Oh, Jesus. Dinah, we're all going
 to burn here.

06:46.040 --> 06:50.040
 Viv, this is the one
 place your mouth doesn't belong.

06:54.680 --> 06:55.816
 Thank you.

06:57.840 --> 07:00.616
 There are many times when I've felt
 underfunded,

07:00.640 --> 07:04.640
 but only as underfunded
 as forces across Britain.

07:05.960 --> 07:09.960
 As to whose fault that is
 is a very public matter.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.856
 Hiya, it's me. Can you call me back
 as soon as you get this?

07:20.880 --> 07:23.016
 It's work. It's urgent.

07:23.040 --> 07:24.176
 To...

07:24.200 --> 07:28.200
 To whoever is going to be in charge
 for the next term,

07:29.280 --> 07:32.536
 Manchester has taken a pasting
 over the last two years.

07:32.560 --> 07:36.560
 We're going to need
 all the help we can get.

07:37.720 --> 07:39.256
 Wish she was running for mayor.

07:39.280 --> 07:42.216
 They don't.

07:42.240 --> 07:45.656
 Thank you.

07:45.680 --> 07:48.056
 To summarise my feelings tonight,

07:48.080 --> 07:52.080
 the difference between us is
 that Hassan fights for minorities.

07:53.120 --> 07:57.120
 I fight for minorities
 to live together.

07:58.840 --> 08:00.520
 You're a traitor, McCoy!
 Oh, God, gun!

08:02.680 --> 08:04.176
 Ma'am! You all right?

08:04.200 --> 08:08.200
 Yeah, we're OK.
 DS Freers to Control. Shots fired.

08:08.240 --> 08:09.856
 Send ambulance and armed response.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.880
 Get out of the way!

08:16.120 --> 08:19.656
 Dinah! Dinah, you all right?
 You OK?  Go.

08:19.680 --> 08:22.856
 He's heading downstairs. I'm on him.

08:22.880 --> 08:24.016
 Fuck off back that way!

08:24.040 --> 08:26.416
 DI Deering to Control.
 I want a one mile cordon,

08:26.440 --> 08:27.736
 repeat, one mile cordon.

08:27.760 --> 08:31.760
 Shooter is white, bald,
 ginger beard.

08:35.880 --> 08:36.880
 Come on!

08:51.480 --> 08:53.016
 Come on!

08:55.040 --> 08:56.040
 Spike!

09:16.800 --> 09:17.816
 DC Tanner's been shot.

09:17.840 --> 09:20.216
 Require urgent medical assistance.

09:20.240 --> 09:23.536
 Where's he hit?

09:23.560 --> 09:24.570
 Joy?

09:27.520 --> 09:28.530
 OK.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.816
 Stay with me.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.616
 Just stay with me.

09:35.640 --> 09:38.880
 Can you hear me? Joy? Joy?

10:01.960 --> 10:03.440
 Come on!

10:13.360 --> 10:14.310
 Dinah.

10:53.760 --> 10:56.536
 Miller, it's all right.
 They checked me out.

10:56.560 --> 11:00.056
 Good. So you remember
 scrapping with him, yeah?

11:00.080 --> 11:03.296
 In which case
 I need his spore, so...

11:03.320 --> 11:06.160
 Stop giving yourself piles
 and get up for me, yeah?

11:13.800 --> 11:16.856
 Ma'am, witnesses say the getaway
 driver drove off without

11:16.880 --> 11:20.016
 the shooter. He escaped on foot.
 We're tracking CCTV...

11:20.040 --> 11:22.656
 All he needs to do is duck
 into anywhere, and we've lost him.

11:22.680 --> 11:26.136
 The bike needs tarmac.
 Track the plates from the station.

11:26.160 --> 11:27.416
 Ma'am?

11:27.440 --> 11:31.296
 The press are asking me to confirm
 that a female officer was killed.

11:31.320 --> 11:33.536
 I don't know what to do.
 My face is telling them.

11:33.560 --> 11:36.976
 Let it. Just don't give a name.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.696
 Oh, Jesus, Viv.

11:38.720 --> 11:40.336
 Her dad.

11:40.360 --> 11:42.096
 He'll be on a shift.

11:41.120 --> 11:42.496
 I'll tell him.  No.

11:41.520 --> 11:44.616
 He needs to hear it from me.
 We need you here.

11:46.640 --> 11:50.640
 I'll go.

11:54.800 --> 11:58.800
Excuse me?

12:12.520 --> 12:15.056
 Jonah?

12:15.080 --> 12:19.080
 Let him lie down in the back.

12:45.640 --> 12:47.576
 Ma'am? Ma'am.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.976
 Those scanners, they had us
 patting down everyone.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.736
 If the gun was on him, he would have
 set them off. There's no way.

12:52.760 --> 12:56.296
 He can't have had it on him when
 he came in.  I know. I know, it's OK.

12:56.320 --> 12:59.376
 I want a full intel check
 on all the town hall staff.

12:59.400 --> 13:01.656
 Floor cleaners, the works, yeah?

13:01.680 --> 13:04.696
 Yes, ma'am.

13:04.720 --> 13:08.720
 DI Deering, can I talk to her?
 Yeah, of course.

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
 I've had deeper piercings.
 It's just a scratch.

13:16.200 --> 13:19.536
 Thanks to you.

13:19.560 --> 13:21.336
 Jesus, I'm so sorry.

13:21.360 --> 13:23.416
 Hey, come on.

13:23.440 --> 13:24.696
 Come on.

13:24.720 --> 13:26.776
 One of the last promises
 I made your mum

13:26.800 --> 13:29.136
 was that I'd keep an eye on you.

13:29.160 --> 13:31.296
 I'm so proud.

13:31.320 --> 13:35.136
 I kept at least that one.

13:35.160 --> 13:38.096
 Did she have kids?

13:38.120 --> 13:42.120
 I know it's a shit thing to ask.

13:42.360 --> 13:44.296
 Did you recognise him?

13:44.320 --> 13:46.176
 Now, I need you to be sure.

13:46.200 --> 13:49.016
 A stalker from the campaign?

13:49.040 --> 13:52.296
 Pissed-off customer, boyfriend?

13:52.320 --> 13:55.336
 What about death threats?  Everything
 I get, I pass on to you lot.

13:55.360 --> 13:58.856
 You know I do.

13:58.880 --> 14:02.880
 Who'd want you dead?

14:08.280 --> 14:11.056
 Dinah.

14:11.080 --> 14:15.080
 I know you must have
 put up some fight.

14:15.080 --> 14:19.080
 So did she.

15:09.480 --> 15:13.160
 Come on.

15:17.800 --> 15:20.136
 Where is she, then? Where is she?

15:20.160 --> 15:23.816
 Come on, babe!

15:23.840 --> 15:25.160
 Settle down!

15:54.920 --> 15:56.216
 Ma'am?

15:56.240 --> 15:57.696
 Tracked the bike.

15:57.720 --> 15:59.736
 Getaway driver went
 like stink to the M60.

15:59.760 --> 16:01.520
 He then doubled back up...

16:06.920 --> 16:10.920
 Keep on it.

16:26.040 --> 16:30.040
 What the fuck just happened?

16:31.440 --> 16:34.896
 Why wasn't Joy at her post?

16:34.920 --> 16:37.496
 She would have seen him stand up.
 She would have...

16:37.520 --> 16:38.736
 You're blaming...

16:38.760 --> 16:40.296
 You're blaming her?

16:40.320 --> 16:41.896
 No, I...

16:41.920 --> 16:44.416
 I'm blaming...

16:44.440 --> 16:48.440
 I'm blaming him.

16:50.680 --> 16:53.136
 Ma'am, the case downstairs
 is clogging up the front desk.

16:53.160 --> 16:57.160
 Fuck's sake, Gavin,
 just deal with it!

16:57.240 --> 17:01.240
 We've all lost her, Dinah.

17:02.240 --> 17:04.296
 Am I going to need
 someone to book them in?

17:04.319 --> 17:05.776
 You book them in.

17:05.800 --> 17:09.800
 Just keep your name
 off the paperwork.

17:11.839 --> 17:15.776
 Now, you take your shock...

17:15.800 --> 17:19.800
 ..your grief, your anger...

17:21.880 --> 17:25.880
 ..and you turn it into fuel.

17:26.839 --> 17:30.840
 Understood?

17:34.120 --> 17:35.456
 Oh, finally.

17:35.480 --> 17:37.856
 What's the matter? Are we not
 important enough for you?

17:37.880 --> 17:39.776
 OK, cool it.
 Tell me what happened.

17:39.800 --> 17:42.016
 My mad bitch of a sister's
 what's happened.

17:42.040 --> 17:44.536
 We were all at the dress fitting,
 drinking champagne.

17:44.560 --> 17:47.496
 Tina decides to neck the lot
 and starts going on, saying

17:47.520 --> 17:49.176
 how Barry's not good enough for me!

17:49.200 --> 17:51.616
 I said, "Don't come, then,
 you silly bitch!"

17:51.640 --> 17:53.816
 What's wrong with our Barry?

17:53.840 --> 17:57.840
 Then she climbed up, we started
 fighting and the next thing...

17:58.880 --> 18:01.776
 She's got my hand in her mouth!

18:01.800 --> 18:05.800
 Who's going to want to say, "I do"
 to a fucking stump?

18:24.200 --> 18:27.656
 On the assumption that
 you didn't go home last night,

18:27.680 --> 18:29.936
 clean underwear.

18:29.960 --> 18:31.816
 I didn't get them
 to open especially.

18:31.840 --> 18:34.816
 These are personal stock.

18:34.840 --> 18:37.896
 The press office are calling
 a conference at 9.30.

18:37.920 --> 18:41.176
 Yeah, well, clean knickers aren't
 my priority right now, Marilyn,

18:41.200 --> 18:42.616
 and you can tell the press that

18:42.640 --> 18:45.200
 I haven't time to give them
 what they want to hear.

18:46.680 --> 18:49.136
 I'm going to be too busy
 stringing people up by the balls

18:49.160 --> 18:53.160
 from here till doomsday.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.080
 Come here.

19:10.440 --> 19:13.496
 I couldn't do it, ma'am.

19:13.520 --> 19:16.256
 Please, please don't make me.

19:16.280 --> 19:19.656
 Viv, nobody is going to
 shove you in front of the public.

19:19.680 --> 19:23.680
 You at least have a sleep.
 You can use my office.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.896
 Before he fired, he called
 Caroline McCoy a traitor.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.296
 What's she done to betray him?

19:33.320 --> 19:35.296
 Or them? Or anybody?

19:35.320 --> 19:37.896
 Caroline's done nothing
 but glue her community together

19:37.920 --> 19:40.416
 like her mam did, before
 they called that politics.

19:40.440 --> 19:42.496
 So it's a lunatic, a lone wolf?

19:42.520 --> 19:45.056
 Lone wolf? With a getaway driver?

19:45.080 --> 19:47.016
 No. He's a pro.

19:47.040 --> 19:50.296
 Oh. Who missed his mark.

19:50.320 --> 19:53.336
 Because I pushed her out of the way,

19:53.360 --> 19:57.360
 setting off a sequence of events
 that I would give anything to erase.

20:02.840 --> 20:06.840
 Well, I'll leave you to it.

20:14.160 --> 20:15.216
 Look sharp!

20:15.240 --> 20:16.696
 We need more than coffee.

20:16.720 --> 20:19.336
 This is undetectable to
 anybody outside the Kremlin.

20:19.360 --> 20:21.856
 Invented by Dr Yayurin Safe.

20:21.880 --> 20:24.456
 This is the man who took our Joy.

20:24.480 --> 20:26.976
 Joseph Beckett, 40.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.776
 Discharged from the Army 2010
 with PTSD.

20:29.800 --> 20:31.136
 That's an old photo.

20:31.160 --> 20:33.016
 Because all his records are sealed,

20:33.040 --> 20:35.816
 we're suspecting he worked
 in special services.  SAS?

20:35.840 --> 20:37.976
 How's he on file if
 he's meant to be that sharp?

20:38.000 --> 20:41.896
 Caught entering Heathrow 2014
 with 30K, mixed currency.

20:41.920 --> 20:44.616
 Suggests that he's been working
 as a mercenary ever since.

20:44.640 --> 20:48.016
 His spores matched the forensic
 evidence left on Spike's gear.

20:48.040 --> 20:50.776
 No known address,
 no family that we can find.

20:50.800 --> 20:54.456
 So me and Joy, we locked a batch
 of protesters in the basement.

20:54.480 --> 20:56.336
 We got them to sign release forms.

20:56.360 --> 20:59.456
 Most were fake names,
 but we lifted fingerprints.

20:59.480 --> 21:00.616
 Fake ID.

21:00.640 --> 21:02.376
 And a lovely brother, Dennis Caddy.

21:02.400 --> 21:04.056
 They run a chapter of Albion.

21:04.080 --> 21:05.336
 He wasn't amongst the rabble,

21:05.360 --> 21:07.136
 because he's better
 than that these days.

21:07.160 --> 21:10.416
 We know Albion have been upping
 their game recently, but seriously,

21:10.440 --> 21:13.016
 somebody paid good money
 for what went down yesterday.

21:13.040 --> 21:14.656
 Albion have never
 been that organised.

21:14.680 --> 21:17.696
 Oh, we beg to differ.

21:17.720 --> 21:21.656
 Achtung, baby, indeed.

21:21.680 --> 21:22.856
 I'm having 'em.

21:22.880 --> 21:25.456
 You are not!

21:25.480 --> 21:28.256
 We are.

21:28.280 --> 21:32.280
 Now, come and sit down.

21:34.880 --> 21:38.880
 Sit.

21:41.240 --> 21:42.856
 This tells us nothing other than

21:42.880 --> 21:45.176
 that Caroline McCoy
 is the centre of gravity.

21:45.200 --> 21:47.496
 But why is McCoy
 a right-wing target?

21:47.520 --> 21:50.656
 I mean, Albion were only there
 because the mayor's a Muslim, right?

21:50.680 --> 21:52.256
 She's not on the left either.

21:52.280 --> 21:56.176
 Well, she must have made
 somebody bleed to come after her
 with this much muscle.

21:56.200 --> 22:00.056
 If she knew who it was,
 she'd surely have told us by now.

22:00.080 --> 22:03.176
 We need to find out what it is
 that she doesn't know.

22:03.200 --> 22:07.056
 We need to examine her life
 in detail - changes in her patterns.

22:07.080 --> 22:09.736
 Changes in her accounts.

22:09.760 --> 22:13.576
 Crack on.

22:13.600 --> 22:16.856
 Jonah, Stuart,
 check the ANPR scanners.

22:16.880 --> 22:20.880
 We need to locate that motorbike
 before it gets scrapped.

22:23.280 --> 22:25.776
 You, you're coming
 with Dinah and me.

22:25.800 --> 22:28.176
 We're going to go and talk
 to that shower of shits

22:28.200 --> 22:30.736
 like a professional team.

22:30.760 --> 22:33.216
 Poker face.

22:33.240 --> 22:37.240
 It's the least we owe ourselves
 today of all days.

22:58.800 --> 23:00.416
 Yeah.

23:00.440 --> 23:03.536
 I'll have to call you back.

23:03.560 --> 23:06.136
 Sorry, we don't hire out for wakes.

23:06.160 --> 23:08.336
 Where's your brother, Faye?
 Changing a keg?

23:08.360 --> 23:10.136
 That's one way of putting it.

23:10.160 --> 23:11.296
 Den?

23:11.320 --> 23:13.416
 Pinch off.

23:13.440 --> 23:17.440
 The fuzz are here.

23:37.600 --> 23:38.776
 Is this them?

23:38.800 --> 23:42.800
 More or less.

23:45.360 --> 23:49.336
 You lot locked my lot in a basement.

23:49.360 --> 23:51.816
 Very brave.

23:51.840 --> 23:53.496
 Legal, though?

23:53.520 --> 23:55.096
 Caught it all on our phones.

23:55.120 --> 23:57.176
 But hand on heart, if you're here

23:57.200 --> 24:00.536
 because you're worried about us
 taking this to our lawyer,

24:00.560 --> 24:03.816
 we're going to wait for
 the hoo-ha to die down first.

24:03.840 --> 24:06.816
 Don't want to smear her name
 before she's in the ground.

24:06.840 --> 24:09.776
 We've questions, Caddy.

24:09.800 --> 24:13.800
 Of course. Come through.

24:15.720 --> 24:19.016
 So, yeah, this is it,
 mission control.

24:19.040 --> 24:22.416
 Excuse the mess. Election's
 our busiest time of the year.

24:22.440 --> 24:24.096
 Here you are, Bon.

24:24.120 --> 24:26.336
 There you go, on the house.

24:26.360 --> 24:28.056
 Appreciate it.  If the shoe fits.

24:28.080 --> 24:30.936
 How long has Joseph Beckett
 being a member of Albion?

24:30.960 --> 24:33.136
 Oh, yeah, I saw
 his face on the news.

24:33.160 --> 24:34.696
 He was way before my time.

24:34.720 --> 24:37.416
 He got kicked out,
 what - about five years ago?

24:37.440 --> 24:39.376
 Said some really toxic shit.

24:39.400 --> 24:41.416
 He's not our type, not at all.

24:41.440 --> 24:43.296
 Why did you throw squash
 at Mayor Hassan?

24:43.320 --> 24:46.816
 Hassan's turned Manchester into
 a petri dish for Islamification.

24:46.840 --> 24:50.136
 They can't even be bothered
 to learn "fuck you" in English.

24:50.160 --> 24:52.936
 But being honest, I was just thirsty

24:52.960 --> 24:56.960
 and fancied seeing if you lot
 could be thwarted by a blackcurrant.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.696
 Beckett called McCoy a traitor.

24:59.720 --> 25:02.776
 Beckett called his dog a traitor.
 He's bonkers, I told you.

25:02.800 --> 25:05.216
 As for McCoy, we'd have
 any of them over Hassan.

25:05.240 --> 25:08.216
 Bonnie thought she was a presenter
 on Loose Women, didn't you, hon?

25:08.240 --> 25:09.816
 When did you break
 out of the basement?

25:09.840 --> 25:11.336
 Why did your mate lock us in?

25:11.360 --> 25:15.360
 If we were Muslim, or Polish,
 no way she'd have had the balls.

25:16.480 --> 25:17.896
 She had it coming.

25:17.920 --> 25:19.856
 What did you say?  All right, Faye.

25:19.880 --> 25:22.496
 Last month was a hustings. Big fuss.

25:22.520 --> 25:26.520
 Hassan was there, red carpet.
 All of you lot were there.

25:27.000 --> 25:31.000
 Except for you, Mr Caddy.

25:31.200 --> 25:34.816
 He was watching the bar for our nan.

25:34.840 --> 25:38.096
 Is that a fact?  All night long.

25:38.120 --> 25:42.120
 Ask any of them.

25:43.880 --> 25:45.416
 They're hiding something.

25:45.440 --> 25:47.816
 I want every stone turned
 on Caddy and Albion.

25:47.840 --> 25:49.976
 Every member past and present,
 every Facebook like.

25:50.000 --> 25:51.336
 I'm on it, ma'am.

25:51.360 --> 25:53.416
Echo 23969 to DI Deering.

25:53.440 --> 25:54.776
 Come in, Jonah.

25:54.800 --> 25:57.296
 We've tracked
 the getaway bike, ma'am.

25:57.320 --> 25:59.256
 Keep him within your sights.

25:59.280 --> 26:01.616
 No problem, ma'am.
 We're already up his arse.

26:01.640 --> 26:03.576
 Why's he going so slow?
 Think he took a bullet?

26:03.600 --> 26:06.136
 That or he's got a gun.
 He wants us closer.

26:06.160 --> 26:07.536
 Jesus.

26:07.560 --> 26:10.000
 What's he doing?
 Why's he not pulling over?

26:13.720 --> 26:17.720
 No, he's... Shit!

26:18.760 --> 26:20.416
 Stay down! Don't move!

26:20.440 --> 26:22.536
 Echo 23969 to Control.

26:22.560 --> 26:24.360
 Ma'am? We've got him.

26:26.640 --> 26:28.936
 He's twatted.

26:28.960 --> 26:31.536
 And tell Dinah
 we're going to need a superpower.

26:31.560 --> 26:35.520
 He's Polish.

26:41.360 --> 26:42.856
 Whoa, whoa.

26:42.880 --> 26:44.336
 Cacked his kecks in the car.

26:44.360 --> 26:47.296
 We booked him in for drunk driving
 but ma'am, no way this guy

26:47.320 --> 26:48.960
 is the getaway driver.
 Look at him.

26:59.680 --> 27:01.896
 Oh, fuck's sake, John,
 he's Romanian.

27:01.920 --> 27:03.216
 I work!

27:03.240 --> 27:06.336
 OK, yeah, well, we're not
 immigration, we're police.

27:06.360 --> 27:07.576
 He's tanked.

27:07.600 --> 27:09.536
 Get him showered and Red Bulled.

27:09.560 --> 27:11.816
 What, our showers?  Stu's right.
 He's not the driver.

27:11.840 --> 27:14.216
 He must have nicked the bike
 after the driver dumped it.

27:14.240 --> 27:16.616
 His feet smell worse than his shit.

27:16.640 --> 27:17.936
 Might have seen him.

27:17.960 --> 27:21.960
 Run his dobs through Interpol.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.376
 Ma'am, you're not going
 to believe this daft fuck...

27:27.400 --> 27:30.136
 Whoa. Oh, my God.

27:30.160 --> 27:32.456
 Come on, Miller, be useful.
 Call a medic.

27:32.480 --> 27:35.496
 Yeah, yeah. Oh, ma'am,
 the helmet had a dash cam in it.

27:35.520 --> 27:38.016
 Driver forgot to check
 before he stole it.

27:38.040 --> 27:42.040
 The visual file's fucked,
 but the driver's voice is stereo.

27:48.400 --> 27:52.400
 Getaway driver's pillow talk
 right after the shots were fired.

27:53.080 --> 27:54.776
 Oh, Jesus!
 What have you done?!

27:54.800 --> 27:58.800
 Fuck this, oh, fuck this!

27:59.440 --> 28:01.256
 It's Caddy.
 Sounds like Caddy.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.136
 It's nowhere near a cigar
 for the CPS.

28:03.160 --> 28:04.736
 You're stalling on this?  Yeah.

28:04.760 --> 28:06.936
 In the absence of
 a witness or a motive.

28:06.960 --> 28:08.976
 Why would Albion
 want to kill Caroline?

28:09.000 --> 28:11.216
Catch.

28:11.240 --> 28:15.016
 The T-shirts and the buses that
 take Albion to the street marches

28:15.040 --> 28:18.336
 are all paid for by this guy -
 Lionel Dirkin.

28:18.360 --> 28:20.376
 You know him?  Should I?

28:20.400 --> 28:21.536
 Well, he founded Pelinor.

28:21.560 --> 28:24.016
 The same private security company
 that employed Beckett.

28:24.040 --> 28:27.576
 Oh, welcome to outside the box,
 bonny lad.

28:27.600 --> 28:31.600
 It's lonely here,
 but we can snuggle up.

28:36.880 --> 28:38.376
 Don't tell me, Julia.

28:38.400 --> 28:40.416
 The gentleman's a police officer.

28:40.440 --> 28:42.936
 DC Tanner, Manchester Met.

28:42.960 --> 28:45.736
 We're preparing for the veterans
 marathon this weekend.

28:45.760 --> 28:47.616
 These lads all fought
 for Queen and country

28:47.640 --> 28:49.816
 and then got tossed on the scrapheap
 on their return.

28:49.840 --> 28:51.496
 They've lost the use of their legs.

28:51.520 --> 28:53.256
 Here, I teach them
 they don't need them.

28:53.280 --> 28:56.056
 They leave their wheelchairs
 on the bank, and I get a swim in.

28:56.080 --> 28:57.736
 Do you kayak?  No.

28:57.760 --> 28:59.296
 No excuse in the world not to.

28:59.320 --> 29:02.096
 How may I help you?
 I'm here to ask...

29:02.120 --> 29:05.536
 about Joseph Beckett.

29:05.560 --> 29:07.336
 Your company was his main employer.

29:07.360 --> 29:08.936
 No, no, Evan.

29:08.960 --> 29:10.096
 Don't help him!

29:10.120 --> 29:14.120
 Let him do it by himself!

29:15.360 --> 29:19.360
 Maybe you should go and...
 No, no.

29:25.520 --> 29:29.520
 You ever teach Beckett
 how to flip a kayak, Mr Dirkin?

29:29.800 --> 29:32.736
 Our business depends on ex-personnel
 from the armed forces, Constable,

29:32.760 --> 29:34.456
 and ex-police, for that matter.

29:34.480 --> 29:38.256
 Beckett hasn't been deployed
 by Pelinor for two years.

29:38.280 --> 29:42.016
 Ever heard of an extreme
 far right group called Albion?

29:42.040 --> 29:44.296
 You pay their expenses.

29:44.320 --> 29:45.816
 Hardly extreme.

29:45.840 --> 29:48.296
 They're a harmless
 street protest movement.

29:48.320 --> 29:51.376
 The Liberals just resent Caddy
 because he knows how to get heard.

29:51.400 --> 29:54.096
 Beckett was also a member of Albion.

29:54.120 --> 29:55.776
 Fleetingly.

29:55.800 --> 29:59.800
 And I was distressed by that.

30:12.680 --> 30:16.536
 What about Lionel Dirkin?

30:16.560 --> 30:18.616
 You know him.

30:18.640 --> 30:22.016
 I know he runs Pelinor.

30:22.040 --> 30:24.256
 I know they're pitching for...

30:24.280 --> 30:25.816
 Caz?

30:25.840 --> 30:27.456
 This is confidential.

30:27.480 --> 30:29.976
 It can't be.

30:30.000 --> 30:34.000
 Pelinor are after a ?250 million
 contract with the council.

30:35.480 --> 30:37.736
 They want a slice of your firm,
 the Manchester Met.

30:37.760 --> 30:40.696
 Well, that was kicked into the long
 grass years ago.  From you lot, yeah.

30:40.720 --> 30:43.856
 But it's still in play.
 Prisons, transport, forensics.

30:43.880 --> 30:46.976
 Pelinor have been working
 with the council hand-in-glove

30:47.000 --> 30:49.616
 for the last four years.
 It's the brass ring, Viv.

30:49.640 --> 30:50.896
 And if you get in?

30:50.920 --> 30:53.256
 Then Dirkin will have
 pissed all his bribes away

30:53.280 --> 30:55.256
 because I'd make him pitch
 from scratch,

30:55.280 --> 30:57.096
 because he's clearly
 out of his box.

30:57.120 --> 31:00.736
 Why are you asking?

31:00.760 --> 31:02.576
 Beckett worked for Pelinor.

31:02.600 --> 31:05.656
 Beckett was a member of Albion.
 Oh, fuck this.

31:05.680 --> 31:07.336
 Fuck this, I'm done.

31:07.360 --> 31:09.096
 I'm going, I'm moving to Australia.

31:09.120 --> 31:11.056
 I can't do this!
 It's just a theory.

31:11.080 --> 31:13.216
 I've got my business to think about.
 Caroline!

31:13.240 --> 31:16.536
 Your name is on every headline, your
 face is right next door to Joy's.

31:16.560 --> 31:19.656
 You better start milking this,
 sweetheart.

31:19.680 --> 31:22.296
 Because Joy's death...

31:22.320 --> 31:25.656
 It's got to stand for
 more than just...

31:25.680 --> 31:28.856
 ..some carving on a London memorial.

31:28.880 --> 31:32.696
 We need more women like her.

31:32.720 --> 31:36.720
 Like you.

31:39.880 --> 31:43.336
 OK, Kev, love. You go and get
 yourself a Kit Kat from the canteen.

31:43.360 --> 31:47.360
 Just give us five minutes.

31:48.280 --> 31:50.056
 Rowley's bike?  Yes, ma'am.

31:50.080 --> 31:51.736
 Marius.

31:51.760 --> 31:55.256
 Can you tell us
 how you got the bike?

31:55.280 --> 31:59.280
 I need drink.

32:02.480 --> 32:04.176
 Drink!

32:04.200 --> 32:08.200
 Drink!

32:13.160 --> 32:14.616
 Serious?

32:14.640 --> 32:15.856
 This is 90%.

32:15.880 --> 32:18.376
 You want to kill our only witness?
 Add water.

32:18.400 --> 32:20.136
 Ma'am, this is a testimony for
 a jury.

32:20.160 --> 32:21.856
 If they see he's pissed,
 we're finished.

32:21.880 --> 32:23.536
 He's on 23 cans of Red Stripe a day.

32:23.560 --> 32:25.656
 If we don't keep him in drink,
 he'll be dead anyway.

32:25.680 --> 32:27.336
 Which is exactly
 what we'll tell them.

32:27.360 --> 32:31.360
 You want them to see him
 looking like this?

32:48.040 --> 32:51.136
 I sleep under bridge.

32:51.160 --> 32:52.536
 I wake.

32:52.560 --> 32:55.696
 I see driver drop bike.

32:55.720 --> 32:59.720
 Take off helmet.

33:00.480 --> 33:04.480
 Did you see his face?

33:04.760 --> 33:06.136
 Marius?

33:06.160 --> 33:10.160
 Could you ID him?

33:14.960 --> 33:18.960
 Da.

33:22.080 --> 33:25.856
 Get off me! I haven't done this!

33:25.880 --> 33:28.696
 You are under arrest in connection
 to the murder of Joy Frears.

33:28.720 --> 33:30.256
 Get the cuffs on him.

33:30.280 --> 33:31.880
 We'll riot!

33:38.000 --> 33:40.456
 Fuck off.

33:40.480 --> 33:44.016
 Hey, that's assault, you!

33:44.040 --> 33:47.496
 It's all right,
 I'll ring Nanny, yeah?

33:47.520 --> 33:49.096
 Regulars all say the same thing.

33:49.120 --> 33:51.016
 Dennis Caddy was in the pub
 all night.

33:51.040 --> 33:53.136
 Bless him.
 Get the tramp ready.

33:53.160 --> 33:56.216
 Ma'am, McCoy is
 talking to the press.

33:56.240 --> 33:59.776
 I'd just like to say,
 on behalf of my family to hers,

33:59.800 --> 34:02.376
 that Sergeant Frears
 will be cherished as

34:02.400 --> 34:04.296
 one of the greatest and bravest

34:04.320 --> 34:06.736
 that the Manchester Met
 have ever had.

34:06.760 --> 34:10.760
 A friend told me to honour
 her sacrifice - well, here I am.

34:11.400 --> 34:12.856
 And I'm still standing.

34:12.880 --> 34:15.416
 I'm standing for what Joy stood for.

34:15.440 --> 34:17.456
 Polling day is a week Thursday.

34:17.480 --> 34:21.480
 Bring it.

34:23.239 --> 34:26.176
 Tramp's prints have come back
 from Interpol.  Please, God.

34:26.199 --> 34:28.456
 He is who he says he is.
 No records.

34:28.480 --> 34:32.480
 CPS says if Marius IDs Caddy,
 we can charge him.

34:33.280 --> 34:37.280
 We've got him, Viv.

34:39.080 --> 34:40.976
 Is this recording, yeah?

34:41.000 --> 34:42.096
 Good.

34:42.120 --> 34:45.496
 Because I want it on that these
 allegations are a fucking disgrace.

34:45.520 --> 34:47.056
 What, like your war record?

34:47.080 --> 34:48.295
 You brag about heroics,

34:48.320 --> 34:50.656
 but you were dishonourably
 discharged for hanging bacon

34:50.679 --> 34:53.016
 off a mosque during a peacekeeping
 mission in Basra.

34:53.040 --> 34:54.576
 That was heroic.

34:54.600 --> 34:57.936
 Have you ever had any association
 with Lionel Dirkin?

34:57.960 --> 35:01.416
 We've got a lot of angels on our
 shoulders, you'd be surprised.

35:01.440 --> 35:03.976
 Pinning me up for this
 is going to cost you.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.616
 I'm no killer.

35:05.640 --> 35:07.936
 We don't think you're the killer,
 Dennis.

35:07.960 --> 35:09.696
 We think you're the getaway driver.

35:09.720 --> 35:12.016
 And a shit one, because you left
 the dash cam on

35:12.040 --> 35:13.616
 in the helmet that you nicked.

35:13.640 --> 35:15.416
 We've got your voice on tape.

35:15.440 --> 35:18.576
 So let's start cutting a bit
 of flab off that sentence.

35:18.600 --> 35:20.576
 Where is your mate Beckett?

35:20.600 --> 35:22.696
 And who hired him to take out McCoy?

35:22.720 --> 35:25.216
 He's not my mate,
 so how the fuck do I know?

35:25.240 --> 35:28.096
 Because we've got a witness who saw
 your face when you dumped the bike.

35:28.120 --> 35:30.016
 He's in the building right now.

35:30.040 --> 35:31.656
 You have the right
 to refuse an ID parade

35:31.680 --> 35:33.136
 where your mug will be one in eight,

35:33.160 --> 35:34.736
 but then that gives us the right

35:34.760 --> 35:36.736
 to park the witness
 outside the station

35:36.760 --> 35:38.856
 and he'll finger you
 as soon as you leave.

35:38.880 --> 35:42.880
 You'll wake up tomorrow morning
 in a Cat A prison

35:43.360 --> 35:47.360
 with Cat A jihadis
 desperate to borrow a cup of sugar.

35:47.640 --> 35:51.640
 Your neck is pulsing
 like a toad, Dennis.

35:51.760 --> 35:54.336
Now, we could, if we...

35:54.360 --> 35:55.856
 Sorry to interrupt.

35:55.880 --> 35:58.056
 Inspector, may I have a word?

35:58.080 --> 36:02.080
 Both of you.

36:09.560 --> 36:12.296
 Jesus, Marilyn. Please don't
 cock-block me in front of perps.

36:12.320 --> 36:15.216
 DC Tanner, please escort Caddy
 back down to his cell.

36:15.240 --> 36:19.240
 What? Ma'am, we've got him!
 Your office, now.

36:31.600 --> 36:34.216
 Diana, got two ticks?

36:34.240 --> 36:36.616
 Easy, watch where you're going.

36:36.640 --> 36:38.496
 Oh, that's never been
 a good look for you.

36:38.520 --> 36:41.376
 Marilyn stole in on Caddy
 and I've got to do something.

36:41.400 --> 36:45.056
 What?

36:45.080 --> 36:46.736
 I don't fucking know.

36:46.760 --> 36:48.216
 Diana, trust me.

36:48.240 --> 36:51.816
 You hear me out before you go doing
 any more of your P45 shit.

36:51.840 --> 36:54.736
 Now, you saw Joy Pied Piper
 those rats into the basement,

36:54.760 --> 36:57.056
 yeah, she was a Catherine wheel,
 best there was. Right?

36:57.080 --> 36:59.976
 So, why did she ditch her post
 at the hustings?

37:00.000 --> 37:01.336
 Even if she left the iron on,

37:01.360 --> 37:03.096
 thought one of her cats
 were on fire,

37:03.120 --> 37:04.816
 Joy would
 never neglect her duty.

37:04.840 --> 37:08.840
 She left to call her dad.
 A 15-second call.

37:09.080 --> 37:10.336
 Now don't you want to know

37:10.360 --> 37:14.900
 what that beautiful kid's
 last sparks for us were?

37:17.120 --> 37:21.120
 What's coming, Marilyn?

37:21.720 --> 37:25.720
 He is.

37:27.440 --> 37:28.856
 OK.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.096
 Sorry I'm late.

37:30.120 --> 37:33.456
 You're either a spook, Special
 Branch or work experience.
 Which is it?

37:33.480 --> 37:34.776
 Viv, this is...

37:34.800 --> 37:36.216
 Chief Inspector Tom Pembroke.

37:36.240 --> 37:38.536
 Special Branch.
 You're joking!

37:38.560 --> 37:41.736
 I've got more five o'clock
 shadow than he has.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.016
 Agreed.

37:43.040 --> 37:44.216
 You little shit.

37:44.240 --> 37:48.240
 Marilyn, are you going to let
 Foetus Cop talk about us like that?

37:49.560 --> 37:52.936
 Dennis Caddy is to be
 released without charge.

37:52.960 --> 37:54.216
 What?

37:54.240 --> 37:56.256
 Albion's the target of
 a larger operation

37:56.280 --> 37:59.136
 and if this man's charged,
 that operation's jeopardised.

37:59.160 --> 38:02.176
 You're joking. We've got one of
 Sergeant Freers' killers downstairs

38:02.200 --> 38:05.176
 and you're ordering me to hold open
 the door for Caddy on the way out?

38:05.200 --> 38:08.896
 Well, you'd better throw me
 a better line than that.

38:08.920 --> 38:10.896
 We planted a UC in Albion.

38:10.920 --> 38:13.616
 If Caddy is charged, the agent's
 position becomes untenable.

38:13.640 --> 38:15.056
 Wait. Stop.

38:15.080 --> 38:19.080
 You had a UC in Albion
 and we were told precisely dick

38:19.520 --> 38:22.616
 about a planned attack
 on McCoy's life?

38:22.640 --> 38:24.456
 And you knew all about it?

38:24.480 --> 38:25.816
 And you pull this now,

38:25.840 --> 38:29.336
 just when we are within a
 hair's breadth of charging him?

38:29.360 --> 38:30.736
 Don't get emotional, Viv.

38:30.760 --> 38:34.760
 Fuck you! I lost a friend.

38:35.560 --> 38:38.696
 If it eases tensions, DCI Marchant
 was almost as in the dark as you.

38:38.720 --> 38:39.816
 You're out of line.

38:39.840 --> 38:41.616
 I'm paid to be, Chief Inspector.

38:41.640 --> 38:44.176
 Oh, you jumped-up little piss stump.
 You're off the case.

38:44.200 --> 38:47.096
 Who was the agent?  Any further
 investigation into Caddy or Albion

38:47.120 --> 38:49.536
 will be regarded as perverting
 the course of justice.

38:49.560 --> 38:50.776
 Been there, done that.

38:50.800 --> 38:53.976
 You lot have threatened curtains
 on my career since year dot.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.296
 So out of my way.

38:55.320 --> 38:56.936
 I am charging him.

38:56.960 --> 38:59.496
 Also, misconduct of public office.

38:59.520 --> 39:01.336
 Not curtains, Inspector.

39:01.360 --> 39:02.576
 Bars.

39:02.600 --> 39:06.600
 Oh, you've been dying to spunk
 that one out, haven't you?

39:08.160 --> 39:09.976
 You'll inform Caddy
 and his solicitor

39:10.000 --> 39:11.976
 that the evidence against
 him is flawed.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.056
 I'll leave the details
 to your imagination

39:14.080 --> 39:16.496
 but keep it convincing.

39:16.520 --> 39:20.520
 Do I make myself clear, Inspector?

39:23.120 --> 39:27.120
 Yes, Sir.

39:31.800 --> 39:35.800
 Ma'am.

39:52.960 --> 39:55.816
 Robin?

39:55.840 --> 39:59.840
 Robin, it's me, Miller.

40:07.600 --> 40:11.600
 Robin, why didn't you call me, huh?

40:12.240 --> 40:16.240
 Look, have you taken or smoked
 owt else I need to fret about?

40:16.800 --> 40:19.736
 Look, Robin, we need
 you to focus, yeah?

40:19.760 --> 40:23.760
 I know, I know, I know.

40:24.800 --> 40:27.376
 Robin...

40:27.400 --> 40:30.096
 Joy phoned you just before she died.

40:30.120 --> 40:32.536
 It was a quick call.

40:32.560 --> 40:34.416
 Can you remember what she said?

40:34.440 --> 40:36.136
 I didn't pick up.

40:36.160 --> 40:38.296
 I was on shift.

40:38.320 --> 40:42.296
 So she left a message?

40:42.320 --> 40:45.296
 Have you listened to it?

40:45.320 --> 40:49.320
 I'm building up to it.

40:51.120 --> 40:55.120
 Passcode's her birthday.

41:00.280 --> 41:01.656
Robin, it's Ada.

41:01.680 --> 41:04.656
 I'm just calling to say
 what a laugh last night was.

41:04.680 --> 41:06.176
 Hey, let's do it again...

41:06.200 --> 41:07.576
Rob? It's Ernie.

41:07.600 --> 41:10.096
 Mate, have I got some
 really strong shit for you.

41:10.120 --> 41:12.096
 It's called God's puss...

41:12.120 --> 41:15.376
Hi, it's, it's me.
 Can you call me back when you get
 this?

41:15.400 --> 41:16.936
 It's, it's work.

41:16.960 --> 41:19.976
 It's urgent.

41:20.000 --> 41:23.416
 I, I need you to find me the photo
 album that you made me for my 21st,

41:23.440 --> 41:25.936
 you know, the one with all
 the Hendon stuff in it.

41:25.960 --> 41:27.456
 It should be under my bed.

41:27.480 --> 41:29.216
 Oh, God, Dad, I don't know.

41:29.240 --> 41:33.240
 It's... It's somewhere.

41:57.400 --> 42:01.400
 Got it. Hendon.

42:09.080 --> 42:13.080
 No, no. There's no way I'm eating
humble pie in front of that piece of shit.

42:13.680 --> 42:15.616
 We have to tuck right in.
 We have no choice!

42:15.640 --> 42:16.896
Ma'am.

42:16.920 --> 42:19.976
 Dinah?
 Caddy's girlfriend, she's a UC.

42:20.000 --> 42:21.936
 She's a fucking cop, Viv.

42:21.960 --> 42:25.960
 She could have stopped it.

42:29.240 --> 42:32.240
 Fucking hell!

42:41.680 --> 42:45.096
 Mr Caddy, I've got some bad news.

42:45.120 --> 42:47.936
 You were witnessed ditching
 the getaway bike by a Romanian tramp

42:47.960 --> 42:50.416
 and he's identified
 you as the getaway driver.

42:50.440 --> 42:51.976
 And what did you offer
 him in return?

42:52.000 --> 42:55.816
 A three-bedroom semi over his head?

42:55.840 --> 42:59.840
 Unfortunately, the tramp is wanted
 by Interpol for fraud.

43:02.280 --> 43:05.576
 We'll be argued down by any bottom
 dollar barrister, even yours.

43:05.600 --> 43:08.736
 Well, God bless Romania, man!

43:08.760 --> 43:10.936
 I'll buy him an ouzo
 or whatever the fuck.

43:10.960 --> 43:12.416
 So what?

43:12.440 --> 43:13.656
 I walk?

43:13.680 --> 43:17.416
 You slither.

43:17.440 --> 43:19.376
 I don't know what's harder to take.

43:19.400 --> 43:24.400
 Your boss' perfume or the
 sweet shit manure of your breath.

43:28.480 --> 43:30.580
 Fuck!

43:35.320 --> 43:37.816
 Yes!

43:37.840 --> 43:41.336
 Oh, my God!

43:41.360 --> 43:43.016
 Hey, Penny?

43:43.040 --> 43:46.176
 Your boyfriend watched his
 mate fire two bullets

43:46.200 --> 43:49.536
 into an unarmed officer.

43:49.560 --> 43:52.776
 You could have saved her.

43:52.800 --> 43:56.736
 I'm sorry about your mate.

43:56.760 --> 43:59.136
 Why don't you go home and
 have a cry and a wank

43:59.160 --> 44:02.136
 to Candle In The Wind for me, OK?

44:02.160 --> 44:03.260
 Babe!

44:25.840 --> 44:28.696
 I've placed Stuart and Jonah
 on surveillance of Dennis Caddy.

44:28.720 --> 44:30.456
 Which part of
 Pembroke's threat of prison

44:30.480 --> 44:31.736
 did you feel had wriggle room?

44:31.760 --> 44:34.216
 You've chosen Dinah. I've made her
 in my own image, Ma'am.

44:34.240 --> 44:35.376
 Stay the fuck way from us!

44:35.400 --> 44:36.736
 Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

44:36.760 --> 44:39.016
 I always wanted it.
 Not like this.

44:39.040 --> 44:40.576
 Shit.  What is it?

44:40.600 --> 44:42.336
 No, I mean it literally shit.

44:42.360 --> 44:44.936
 If it's ricin, we're playing footsie
 in the morgue already.

44:44.960 --> 44:46.136
 This is code red.

44:46.160 --> 44:48.456
 Everyone out.  This is Beckett.
 Happy hunting.

44:48.480 --> 44:50.736
 You need to work out what you want
 your face next to

44:50.760 --> 44:52.616
 in the news on the eve of an
 election, Sir,

44:52.640 --> 44:55.540
 panic in the streets or a row of
 stiffs in an outbreak tent.

45:00.880 --> 45:02.600
