00:04.383 --> 00:06.508
You see what Carolyn
was wearing today, man?

00:06.741 --> 00:08.080
Damn, she's hot.

00:08.446 --> 00:09.760
Today's the day, man.

00:10.158 --> 00:11.341
I'm gonna ask her out.

00:11.365 --> 00:13.874
Just got to figure out how to
get a few minutes alone with her.

00:13.898 --> 00:15.291
Know what I'm saying?

00:15.776 --> 00:18.360
Hey, Richie, you forgot
to sign your timecard.

00:18.506 --> 00:21.059
Sorry about that, Carolyn.
I'll be right down.

00:21.311 --> 00:23.069
Dude, what are you doing?

00:23.383 --> 00:24.434
The bro rule!

00:24.774 --> 00:25.988
I called dibs.

00:26.220 --> 00:27.790
Survival of the fittest, my man.

00:28.169 --> 00:29.614
You ain't got a shot.

00:31.216 --> 00:32.354
What the...?

00:32.701 --> 00:34.310
Hey, come on, Mike.

00:34.334 --> 00:36.150
I just want one date, come on.

01:11.317 --> 01:13.520
Well, I'm not exactly
sure' how it works.

01:13.544 --> 01:15.698
Yeah, that's why I'm
not in charge of that.

01:16.942 --> 01:18.201
What's going on here?

01:18.225 --> 01:20.824
Did I get off on the wrong floor?
I thought this was an office.

01:20.848 --> 01:23.026
Officer David and I are
engaged in a linguistic

01:23.068 --> 01:26.838
developmental exercise intended
to bolster her English vocabulary.

01:27.274 --> 01:29.013
That's good. You think
Gibbs will buy it?

01:29.096 --> 01:32.477
It is not my vocabulary that
needs bolsterment, McGee.

01:32.701 --> 01:34.963
- Not a word... hence the scoreboard.
- No.

01:35.120 --> 01:37.215
50-point cushion for the professor,

01:37.370 --> 01:39.728
and there's only one tile left to play.

01:40.345 --> 01:42.921
Gonna be kind of tough to
play that "Q" without a "U".

01:43.548 --> 01:45.302
- You peeked.
- Did not.

01:45.623 --> 01:47.954
Process of elimination. I
counted the tiles on the board.

01:48.122 --> 01:50.275
You suck the fun out
of everything, McCheat.

01:53.360 --> 01:54.424
Give it up, Ziva.

01:58.772 --> 01:59.653
"Kwee"?

01:59.721 --> 02:01.321
- I don't think so.
- "Chi",

02:01.466 --> 02:04.104
as in the life energy that
flows through all things.

02:04.332 --> 02:06.506
You should've seen that one
coming, Probie Wan-Kenobi.

02:06.548 --> 02:07.548
No.

02:08.064 --> 02:09.676
62 points!

02:09.997 --> 02:11.724
- Jedi wins.
- I'm challenging.

02:12.059 --> 02:15.459
You all are. Grab your
gear. Playtime's over.

02:18.744 --> 02:20.960
That was a... a language exercise, boss.

02:21.065 --> 02:24.101
- We weren't actually playing.
- So McGee didn't actually lose.

02:24.142 --> 02:25.143
Correct.

02:25.311 --> 02:27.971
So he's not actually humiliated.

02:29.980 --> 02:30.980
"Kwee".

02:33.660 --> 02:34.736
Did you know him?

02:34.854 --> 02:36.111
Wasn't one of our guys.

02:36.153 --> 02:38.057
Had the same crew on
here since the beginning.

02:38.149 --> 02:40.022
- What's the job?
- Retrofitting.

02:40.186 --> 02:41.673
Building's only ten years old.

02:41.760 --> 02:43.812
Yeah, well, they don't
make them like they used to.

02:43.881 --> 02:44.929
Security guard?

02:45.171 --> 02:46.385
Not on weekends.

02:47.264 --> 02:48.378
Who knew that?

02:49.120 --> 02:50.910
- Who didn't?
- Are these...

02:51.021 --> 02:52.793
these guys gonna be here a while?

02:53.590 --> 02:54.590
Yeah.

03:01.790 --> 03:03.109
Spatter over here.

03:03.321 --> 03:04.905
Looks like this is where it started.

03:05.173 --> 03:06.457
And that's where it ended.

03:06.604 --> 03:10.268
Right, okay, so... We got
the altercation starting here.

03:11.069 --> 03:12.295
Fight, fight, fight.

03:12.553 --> 03:13.871
Scuffle, scuffle, scuffle.

03:14.052 --> 03:15.548
And they end up here.

03:15.734 --> 03:17.706
Man falls over the edge,

03:17.826 --> 03:21.284
lands on the roof of the cage,
which was three stories down,

03:21.452 --> 03:23.643
and then he rides the elevator

03:23.756 --> 03:25.246
all the way back up.

03:25.552 --> 03:26.925
To the crime scene.

03:27.092 --> 03:29.561
Yeah, it's funny till someone
plunges to their death.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.294
Come on, still with the height thing?

03:32.440 --> 03:33.795
You got to get over that, man.

03:33.819 --> 03:35.941
You don't just get over
irrational fears, Tony.

03:35.983 --> 03:37.130
They're irrational.

03:37.361 --> 03:39.493
So, we got a struggle and a dead guy.

03:39.765 --> 03:40.855
Struggle over what?

03:40.983 --> 03:42.093
Over the edge.

03:42.758 --> 03:44.908
All right, here's the cell phone.

03:45.088 --> 03:46.430
I'm heading back down.

03:46.590 --> 03:48.244
Dead, just like its owner.

03:48.974 --> 03:50.210
Need a hand, Dr. Mallard?

03:50.247 --> 03:53.912
The best way to renew the mind
and body, Mr. Palmer, is exercise.

03:54.062 --> 03:56.407
The more, the merrier
when it comes to stairs.

03:56.461 --> 03:59.124
- I didn't mean...
- My cardio is fine.

03:59.403 --> 04:01.483
Unlike this poor fellow.

04:04.317 --> 04:05.908
Use the thermometer.

04:06.094 --> 04:08.708
That is one nasty contusion.

04:09.088 --> 04:12.816
He struck something hard, or
else something hard struck him.

04:13.016 --> 04:14.264
Yeah, we're still looking.

04:14.337 --> 04:17.583
Rick Baxter, 34 years of age,
Virginia driver's license.

04:17.690 --> 04:21.349
We won't be able to tell you much
more until we get him back to autopsy.

04:21.432 --> 04:23.167
Got to figure out
what he was doing here.

04:23.191 --> 04:24.824
And with whom he was doing it.

04:24.909 --> 04:26.035
Doing what with?

04:26.076 --> 04:28.980
Whatever it was he was
doing when he was undone.

04:29.315 --> 04:30.676
Done... what?

04:31.128 --> 04:32.128
Done.

04:32.770 --> 04:34.299
In, my dear fellow.

04:34.520 --> 04:35.651
Done in.

04:35.801 --> 04:37.958
Don't you understand
the Queen's English?

04:38.363 --> 04:39.390
Not this queen.

04:41.119 --> 04:42.145
Time of death.

04:42.291 --> 04:44.322
Approximately 4:00 A.M.

04:44.563 --> 04:45.799
Okay, thanks.

04:46.100 --> 04:47.673
He's an early riser.

04:47.883 --> 04:49.244
Early demiser.

04:49.386 --> 04:51.103
Please, Mr. Palmer.

04:51.281 --> 04:52.399
Dr. Mallard.

04:52.768 --> 04:54.426
Aren't we forgetting something?

04:54.484 --> 04:56.757
- No, I'm gonna get the gurney.
- I should do that.

04:56.807 --> 04:59.553
No, I shall use the elevator, so

04:59.673 --> 05:02.323
you get the body off the roof

05:02.575 --> 05:03.810
to down here.

05:03.917 --> 05:04.916
And then...

05:04.940 --> 05:07.200
And then we can move the
body back into the cage.

05:07.380 --> 05:08.742
Good thinking, Mr. Palmer.

05:27.412 --> 05:28.417
Mr. Palmer!

05:35.346 --> 05:37.586
- Nice job of parking.
- Sorry.

05:38.070 --> 05:39.347
It's all clear up there?

05:39.439 --> 05:41.543
- All clear, Doctor.
- Good.

05:57.592 --> 05:58.592
McGee?

06:00.078 --> 06:01.671
Did you take that passport, McGee?

06:16.998 --> 06:17.998
Tony?

06:28.510 --> 06:30.165
Ziva, is that you?

06:31.246 --> 06:32.293
Who's there?

06:40.741 --> 06:42.731
Hey, hey! Stop!

06:43.710 --> 06:44.710
Mr. Palmer?

06:46.017 --> 06:47.017
Stop!

06:54.398 --> 06:55.398
Jimmy?

07:05.276 --> 07:06.276
Jimmy?

07:06.972 --> 07:07.972
Jimmy!

07:09.067 --> 07:10.449
Are you all right?

07:21.522 --> 07:23.714
So, we got no shooter,

07:23.879 --> 07:26.290
we got no shell casings, we got nothing.

07:26.881 --> 07:28.808
This guy gonna be useful to us at all?

07:30.028 --> 07:32.415
He's a witness, not a suspect.

07:32.575 --> 07:34.878
He's an assistant to
the medical examiner.

07:34.925 --> 07:37.280
- He's paid to observe things.
- He's not a field agent.

07:37.430 --> 07:38.837
He's a member of your team.

07:39.004 --> 07:41.833
- No. He works for Ducky.
- Ducky works for you.

07:45.171 --> 07:47.572
Something bugging you, Leon?

07:50.484 --> 07:51.484
Yeah.

07:51.738 --> 07:53.537
Director's back end of the week.

07:53.657 --> 07:54.680
I want to go home.

07:54.951 --> 07:57.401
I miss my kids. I miss San Diego.

07:57.605 --> 07:59.381
Missed my damn flight
because of this case.

07:59.465 --> 08:01.462
I just want it solved, so I can leave.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.765
- Works for me.
- Like I said...

08:03.940 --> 08:05.079
I got him.

08:09.298 --> 08:10.298
Luck.

08:14.705 --> 08:17.406
I saw some of these guys at
the Navy Annex garage, but...

08:17.853 --> 08:19.934
none of them look like
the guy who shot at me.

08:20.054 --> 08:21.748
What about the photo on the passport?

08:21.986 --> 08:23.200
Definitely the dead guy.

08:23.642 --> 08:24.642
Positive.

08:25.055 --> 08:26.253
Name on the passport?

08:28.014 --> 08:30.883
It wasn't the name on the
driver's license, which was...

08:31.955 --> 08:33.212
- Baxter?
- Right.

08:33.962 --> 08:36.455
I think the name on the
passport started with...

08:37.400 --> 08:39.832
S- U-S or an S-A-S.

08:40.176 --> 08:41.176
Country?

08:42.909 --> 08:45.309
The lettering wasn't in
English. It was like...

08:45.560 --> 08:46.628
Hieroglyphics.

08:46.681 --> 08:47.749
Design, then.

08:49.305 --> 08:50.569
Blue cover.

08:51.074 --> 08:52.440
Might have been like a...

08:52.876 --> 08:55.263
an eagle or a star, stylized.

08:55.622 --> 08:57.276
You know, like... like a swirl.

08:58.056 --> 08:59.056
Sort of.

09:00.177 --> 09:01.177
Swirly?

09:01.617 --> 09:04.851
So you saw a man with a gun and
you decided to chase after him?

09:05.882 --> 09:08.604
No, I chased after him,
and then I saw the gun.

09:10.484 --> 09:12.285
I can't tell if you're dumb or brave.

09:13.338 --> 09:14.511
Not brave enough.

09:16.246 --> 09:17.246
The gun...

09:19.742 --> 09:22.450
- What about it?
- Automatic, revolver?

09:22.637 --> 09:25.649
Nickel-plated, black?
Dull, shiny, big, small?

09:26.185 --> 09:27.642
- Big.
- The barrel!

09:28.097 --> 09:29.856
Yes, the barrel.

09:36.085 --> 09:37.572
You want to take a minute?

09:40.807 --> 09:42.671
No, no, I... I'm good.

09:43.331 --> 09:45.090
- I'm good.
- All right.

09:45.693 --> 09:46.693
Height?

09:48.019 --> 09:49.020
Average.

09:49.136 --> 09:50.587
Can you be more specific?

09:50.857 --> 09:52.763
It all happened so fast.

09:52.839 --> 09:56.349
- But you got a really good look at him?
- Yeah, a very good look...

09:59.131 --> 10:01.004
Beady eyes. Okay?

10:01.918 --> 10:03.015
Reptilian.

10:03.762 --> 10:06.486
So we're looking for a beady-eyed

10:07.028 --> 10:09.373
reptile with a big gun?

10:12.160 --> 10:13.668
How close were you to the shooter?

10:14.840 --> 10:15.840
How close?

10:16.429 --> 10:20.153
Feet, yards, inches... how close?

10:26.711 --> 10:27.711
Okay.

10:31.289 --> 10:32.368
What are you doing?

10:32.462 --> 10:33.698
Pythagorean theorem.

10:33.932 --> 10:35.937
By calculating two fixed points,

10:36.012 --> 10:38.246
then factoring in the shooter
as a third fixed object,

10:38.270 --> 10:41.886
- I think I can estimate how far...
- Okay, that's enough for tonight.

10:42.627 --> 10:45.455
Go down to Sciuto's lab first
thing in the morning, draw a sketch.

10:45.762 --> 10:47.082
I want to put a BOLO out.

10:52.795 --> 10:53.795
Sir...

10:54.947 --> 10:56.497
I'm so sorry that I couldn't...

10:56.788 --> 10:57.807
Remember?

10:59.114 --> 11:00.115
Catch him.

11:00.887 --> 11:01.984
It's okay.

11:02.505 --> 11:03.577
We'll catch him.

11:11.789 --> 11:13.338
Rick Baxter, 34.

11:13.443 --> 11:15.835
Single, born in Denver,
no known relatives.

11:15.897 --> 11:17.082
According to the DMV,

11:17.133 --> 11:20.063
he's lived at the same address
in Virginia for the past 11 years.

11:20.087 --> 11:20.798
And?

11:20.822 --> 11:23.666
The address has been a strip
mall for the past two years.

11:23.800 --> 11:25.513
Baxter's condo was demolished.

11:25.568 --> 11:28.191
No record of a current address.
Renewed his license by mail.

11:28.312 --> 11:29.778
- Fake?
- No, it's real.

11:29.814 --> 11:32.410
Hologram, strip mag,
everything checks out.

11:32.434 --> 11:34.008
Only fake part is the address.

11:34.032 --> 11:35.009
Passport?

11:35.033 --> 11:36.801
Baxter's never applied
for one in his life.

11:36.832 --> 11:40.173
- He's never left the country.
- So, real driver's license,

11:40.385 --> 11:43.756
phony address and a fake
passport. It's like Jason Bourne.

11:44.151 --> 11:46.036
Should we put out a BOLO for Matt Damon?

11:48.625 --> 11:50.289
- Or not.
- Prints.

11:50.359 --> 11:52.032
Baxter's not in any system anywhere.

11:52.109 --> 11:55.145
He's never been arrested,
never served in the military...

11:55.351 --> 11:59.351
So there is no way to know
who Baxter really is or is not.

11:59.636 --> 12:02.505
He didn't take the license, he
took the passport. That's the key.

12:02.714 --> 12:06.108
Maybe Mini-Mallard made a
mistake and it wasn't a passport.

12:07.990 --> 12:08.990
It was.

12:10.585 --> 12:12.873
Baxter hasn't filed a
tax return in ten years.

12:12.993 --> 12:14.622
No applications for unemployment.

12:14.742 --> 12:16.524
- Bank records?
- Dormant account.

12:16.771 --> 12:18.697
Defaulted to the state five years ago.

12:18.904 --> 12:19.909
Phone.

12:21.067 --> 12:22.868
Baxter's cell was a burn phone, boss.

12:23.207 --> 12:26.347
Purchased at a convenience
store with cash ten days ago.

12:26.480 --> 12:28.093
So there's no address to trace.

12:28.164 --> 12:29.672
From the phone's SIM card

12:29.725 --> 12:32.447
we know that a call was placed
from his cell at 4:03 this morning.

12:32.587 --> 12:34.061
Around the time of death.

12:34.251 --> 12:35.251
Trace.

12:35.396 --> 12:37.516
That's going to be a
bit of a problem, boss.

12:37.604 --> 12:40.012
The phone he called
was also a burn phone.

12:40.323 --> 12:43.359
So even going off cell towers,
we can't really get a fix.

12:44.755 --> 12:46.284
Maybe I can...

12:46.503 --> 12:48.619
maybe I can track all
transmissions from both phones,

12:48.643 --> 12:51.104
see if I can find a common number
that links both to a land line.

12:51.128 --> 12:52.573
Yeah, do that. Passport.

12:52.618 --> 12:53.995
Shooter. Dead guy.

12:54.115 --> 12:55.379
Connect the dots.

12:55.916 --> 12:56.916
Yeah. Gibbs.

12:58.490 --> 12:59.579
Be right there.

13:03.802 --> 13:05.103
- Duck.
- Jethro.

13:05.223 --> 13:07.086
The wound to Mr. Baxter's

13:07.125 --> 13:09.848
left temporal lobe did not kill him.

13:09.964 --> 13:12.194
I found evidence of blood in his lungs,

13:12.253 --> 13:15.735
indicating that he lived some
time after the initial blow.

13:15.777 --> 13:17.562
- Enough time to make a phone call?
- Yeah.

13:17.747 --> 13:19.580
911 would have been advisable.

13:21.199 --> 13:24.063
- He had something to hide. Death?
- Exsanguination.

13:24.717 --> 13:27.254
Shattered spleen and a crushed liver

13:27.305 --> 13:29.176
and other assorted abdominal injuries.

13:29.220 --> 13:31.293
Not to mention all the fractures.

13:31.413 --> 13:32.413
The fall.

13:32.457 --> 13:33.986
With catastrophic results.

13:34.072 --> 13:37.594
I surmise the blow to the
head made him lose his balance,

13:37.631 --> 13:40.961
and that caused him to
fall to his untimely death.

13:41.875 --> 13:45.330
I don't know how it
fits into your puzzle,

13:45.455 --> 13:48.243
but it is on his upper extremities,

13:48.363 --> 13:50.837
and throughout his respiratory system.

13:51.072 --> 13:52.217
He was breathing it.

13:52.337 --> 13:54.213
- It seems so.
- What is it?

13:54.333 --> 13:56.108
Abby is running tests.

13:57.487 --> 13:58.487
Thanks, Duck.

13:58.663 --> 14:00.170
How is Mr. Palmer?

14:01.635 --> 14:04.487
I really miss his assistance.

14:04.675 --> 14:07.950
You never fully appreciate
someone until they're not here.

14:08.118 --> 14:09.297
He'll be all right.

14:09.746 --> 14:12.986
Jimmy may not have had a
good look at the shooter,

14:13.010 --> 14:16.340
but I fear the shooter may
have had a good look at him.

14:16.422 --> 14:17.422
Duck.

14:18.009 --> 14:19.663
You let me worry about the shooter.

14:26.343 --> 14:27.879
My soup is simmering.

14:28.816 --> 14:31.399
Now back to my masterpiece.

14:31.970 --> 14:33.495
Now flare the nostrils.

14:35.762 --> 14:37.184
Split the difference.

14:39.471 --> 14:41.023
What about the ears?

14:42.397 --> 14:43.397
Bigger?

14:44.253 --> 14:45.949
Well, not that big.

14:46.692 --> 14:48.573
Yeah, like that. Now,

14:49.009 --> 14:52.031
reduce the density of
the orbicularis oris area.

14:52.791 --> 14:54.366
- The what?
- The space

14:54.541 --> 14:56.426
between the nose and the upper lip.

14:57.322 --> 14:58.911
We call that a Cupid's Bow.

14:58.935 --> 15:02.451
One time I got my lip stuck in a vacuum
cleaner display at the department store.

15:02.475 --> 15:05.443
I lost, like, a quart of saliva
before my cousin pulled the plug

15:05.519 --> 15:08.337
I still have nightmares about it.
Can't be alone with a HEPA filter.

15:08.601 --> 15:09.774
How old were you?

15:09.986 --> 15:11.042
Twenty-two.

15:11.859 --> 15:13.409
It was, like, Fat Tuesday

15:13.536 --> 15:14.897
- or Arbor Day.
- That's him!

15:14.954 --> 15:16.135
That is the guy.

15:16.533 --> 15:17.637
That's the guy?

15:17.790 --> 15:19.553
That's the guy that
picked up the passport?

15:19.577 --> 15:21.139
Yeah. Why, what's wrong?

15:22.702 --> 15:24.796
So you got shot at by Dr. Jekyll?

15:24.934 --> 15:26.523
I think you're referring to Mr. Hyde.

15:26.547 --> 15:29.206
Dr. Jekyll's the one who invented
the potion, but look, yeah,

15:29.306 --> 15:32.091
you have captured his essence perfectly.

15:32.701 --> 15:34.314
His anger.

15:35.262 --> 15:36.422
His intent.

15:36.553 --> 15:37.894
His bloodlust.

15:38.231 --> 15:39.394
His likeness?

15:39.728 --> 15:41.078
It's his likeness.

15:41.482 --> 15:43.064
That's kind of the point here.

15:43.946 --> 15:45.692
You know what? Let's start over.

15:46.729 --> 15:48.970
Okay. He was a white guy, right?

15:49.649 --> 15:52.542
I couldn't catch him, now
I can't even identify him.

15:53.506 --> 15:55.747
I'm sure Gibbs thinks
I'm completely useless.

15:55.890 --> 15:56.890
No.

15:57.188 --> 15:58.188
Jimmy!

15:58.860 --> 16:01.394
You chased a crazy guy with a gun.

16:01.668 --> 16:03.686
You're a stud muffin.

16:03.966 --> 16:06.395
You're an iron fist with a velvet glove.

16:06.559 --> 16:07.900
You're Baby Gibbs.

16:09.279 --> 16:10.279
Really?

16:16.063 --> 16:18.116
Now make the bridge of the nose flatter.

16:20.289 --> 16:21.289
McGee.

16:22.758 --> 16:24.981
Done, boss. Common calls
from both burn phones

16:25.028 --> 16:27.058
were made to a single
residence two days ago.

16:27.090 --> 16:29.365
- Address.
- A mobile home park in Alexandria.

16:29.389 --> 16:30.863
I hope there's no tornados.

16:30.887 --> 16:32.627
You know about tornadoes
and trailer homes.

16:32.651 --> 16:34.076
Gear. Go. Get back.

16:34.100 --> 16:35.712
Wow, should've seen that coming.

16:47.842 --> 16:49.622
Looks like we missed the twister.

17:04.946 --> 17:08.103
It was Baxter's house but it
disappeared in the middle of the night.

17:08.173 --> 17:09.519
No one heard or saw it leave.

17:09.561 --> 17:11.299
Put a BOLO out on the
plates, nothing yet.

17:11.340 --> 17:13.517
His neighbor's positively
identified Baxter

17:13.559 --> 17:15.436
from our driver's license photograph.

17:15.479 --> 17:17.510
Manager said Baxter had
been there for a year,

17:17.534 --> 17:19.960
paid through the end of the
month. Gave no notice of leaving.

17:19.983 --> 17:22.865
Someone is going to great
lengths to clean up after him.

17:23.179 --> 17:24.344
The question is why?

17:24.612 --> 17:25.820
I took that picture.

17:26.868 --> 17:28.565
Notice anything odd about it?

17:29.796 --> 17:31.189
A little underexposed.

17:31.505 --> 17:33.669
Five-gallon drum.
Abby ran the contents:

17:33.741 --> 17:34.897
Hydrofluoric acid.

17:35.619 --> 17:37.252
That's important because...

17:37.444 --> 17:39.266
They don't use it in construction.

17:39.653 --> 17:42.619
I knew that. That's
why I took the picture.

17:43.314 --> 17:45.241
I'm really trying here, McGee.

17:45.508 --> 17:46.786
Jimmy, I know.

17:47.390 --> 17:48.393
Passport.

17:48.764 --> 17:50.112
Okay... blue.

17:50.907 --> 17:53.902
Dark blue. I'm pretty
sure it was dark blue.

17:53.986 --> 17:56.868
Yes, you have narrowed it down to
the most popular color in the world.

17:57.895 --> 17:59.110
I'm sorry, McGee.

17:59.884 --> 18:01.308
It's all right, don't worry.

18:02.503 --> 18:05.623
Again, these represent
every dark blue passport

18:05.686 --> 18:08.180
in the world from Argentina to Zimbabwe.

18:08.510 --> 18:09.578
There's so many.

18:09.799 --> 18:10.805
Seventy-two.

18:11.191 --> 18:14.596
With each country averaging ten percent
of the population with passports,

18:14.684 --> 18:17.909
we're looking at approximately
200 million suspects.

18:19.404 --> 18:20.807
Give or take a few million.

18:22.682 --> 18:24.777
I took a wilderness survival course.

18:25.132 --> 18:26.410
Spent two weeks alone.

18:27.207 --> 18:28.575
I even encountered a bear.

18:30.432 --> 18:33.239
But a ten-second encounter
with a bad guy, and I go blank.

18:36.251 --> 18:37.901
I do not understand.

18:39.404 --> 18:41.665
Well, was that bear in
the woods packing heat?

18:44.414 --> 18:45.414
No.

18:45.845 --> 18:46.913
There you go.

18:48.108 --> 18:49.762
Guess you never know, do you?

18:50.246 --> 18:51.246
What?

18:51.437 --> 18:52.819
How you'll respond.

18:53.414 --> 18:56.681
In a moment of crisis, you have
a split second to make a decision.

18:57.841 --> 18:59.958
Jimmy, someone was
pointing a gun at you.

19:00.362 --> 19:02.837
In that split second, you chose to duck.

19:03.359 --> 19:05.142
I think you passed with flying colors.

19:05.247 --> 19:07.341
It's like it fried my brain circuitry.

19:10.446 --> 19:12.038
We're going to fix that.

19:12.366 --> 19:13.366
Okay?

19:15.252 --> 19:17.912
You mind if I ask you
a personal question?

19:18.461 --> 19:19.461
Yeah.

19:20.813 --> 19:23.242
How did you handle getting
shot at the first time?

19:27.090 --> 19:29.666
Well, you know, I'm a
highly trained federal agent.

19:29.719 --> 19:32.924
It's not really a fair comparison.
Anything on these passports?

19:37.379 --> 19:39.452
I'm not a lot of help, am I?

19:42.586 --> 19:43.725
All right.

19:44.392 --> 19:46.444
There is something
else that we could try.

19:48.631 --> 19:51.165
Your eyes are getting heavy.

19:51.363 --> 19:52.957
All information

19:53.101 --> 19:55.719
is recorded in the subconscious mind.

19:56.857 --> 19:58.763
I'm going to count down from three.

19:59.371 --> 20:00.964
As I'm counting down,

20:01.151 --> 20:04.230
you are going to go into a
deeper state of relaxation.

20:05.878 --> 20:06.878
Three.

20:07.873 --> 20:09.737
You're getting calm and relaxed.

20:10.750 --> 20:14.164
Two, you're going into a
deeper state of comfort.

20:16.909 --> 20:17.909
One.

20:18.689 --> 20:21.286
You're in a deep sleep.

20:28.700 --> 20:29.902
You're at peace.

20:30.897 --> 20:34.122
You have the ability to
retrieve any information at will.

20:34.427 --> 20:36.019
You have total recall.

20:36.774 --> 20:39.831
If at anytime you feel
a block to your memory,

20:40.062 --> 20:41.433
take a deep breath...

20:43.631 --> 20:45.569
and the block will melt away.

20:45.795 --> 20:46.796
Understand?

20:47.362 --> 20:48.362
Okay.

20:48.437 --> 20:50.343
I'm going to take you back to yesterday.

20:50.449 --> 20:52.091
You're at the crime scene.

20:52.677 --> 20:54.504
You find a passport.

20:55.014 --> 20:56.082
Passport?

20:56.239 --> 20:57.239
Yeah.

20:57.424 --> 20:58.555
Do you see it?

21:00.005 --> 21:01.554
It's vinyl. Dark blue.

21:01.807 --> 21:03.490
- Vinyl?
- Yes.

21:03.847 --> 21:05.559
- Dark blue?
- Yes.

21:05.913 --> 21:06.907
Pick it up.

21:06.931 --> 21:08.456
No, I'm going to get hurt.

21:08.480 --> 21:09.528
You're safe, Jimmy.

21:09.718 --> 21:11.156
No one's going to hurt you.

21:11.773 --> 21:12.773
Deep breath.

21:14.379 --> 21:15.379
Good.

21:16.793 --> 21:17.793
Okay.

21:17.947 --> 21:19.371
You're at the crime scene.

21:19.635 --> 21:20.664
You look down

21:20.861 --> 21:22.058
and what do you see?

21:23.637 --> 21:24.664
Leather.

21:25.529 --> 21:26.597
Light brown.

21:27.154 --> 21:28.154
What?

21:30.128 --> 21:31.887
Okay, pick it up.

21:32.921 --> 21:33.940
And look at it.

21:34.131 --> 21:35.418
Are you doing it?

21:35.948 --> 21:37.540
Okay, what does it say?

21:37.919 --> 21:39.644
Cole Haan,

21:40.126 --> 21:41.344
low boot,

21:41.864 --> 21:43.728
size seven and a half.

21:44.397 --> 21:46.114
Sounds like a woman's boot.

21:46.779 --> 21:48.803
Jimmy, put Ziva's boot down.

21:49.525 --> 21:50.904
Can you hear me? It's Abby.

21:51.024 --> 21:52.024
Abby.

21:52.456 --> 21:55.139
Black. High platforms. Dementia.

21:55.504 --> 21:57.221
Size ten.

21:57.365 --> 21:58.412
Jimmy!

21:58.812 --> 21:59.812
What?

22:00.381 --> 22:01.462
What did I say?

22:01.761 --> 22:02.942
Did we catch him?

22:03.133 --> 22:04.830
Did we learn anything about this guy?

22:04.901 --> 22:07.163
No, but we certainly
learned something about you.

22:08.365 --> 22:09.396
Whatever it is,

22:09.471 --> 22:10.684
it's not what you think.

22:11.118 --> 22:12.344
If the shoe fits...

22:13.107 --> 22:14.821
Wait, wait. Where are you going?

22:15.396 --> 22:18.670
- These boots were made for walking.
- Wait. You can't just give up.

22:20.783 --> 22:22.417
We're not giving up, Jimmy.

22:22.626 --> 22:23.652
We're moving on.

22:23.854 --> 22:26.760
No, no, no. I. I have to
do this. Please. Please!

22:29.113 --> 22:30.244
Try again?

22:37.638 --> 22:40.403
Balding, short-cropped
rim of dark hair.

22:41.514 --> 22:43.881
Squinty eyes, but set
deep in its sockets.

22:45.687 --> 22:46.930
Full face.

22:47.703 --> 22:49.608
Small scar on the right jaw line.

22:50.133 --> 22:51.890
His details are amazing.

22:52.985 --> 22:54.552
Right down to the scar.

22:54.672 --> 22:57.549
Sideburns about two
inches lower than the ears.

22:58.709 --> 23:01.641
Small gold ring in his left earlobe.

23:03.205 --> 23:04.344
Razor stubble.

23:05.015 --> 23:06.217
Pale complexion.

23:06.901 --> 23:08.408
He's got every feature.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.751
This is good enough for a BOLO.

23:11.315 --> 23:15.231
Okay, Jimmy, I'm going to
count backwards from four.

23:15.761 --> 23:18.698
When I get to one, you're
going to open your eyes.

23:19.631 --> 23:22.804
Four, three, two,

23:23.426 --> 23:24.426
one.

23:28.464 --> 23:29.464
How'd I do?

23:30.135 --> 23:31.022
Great.

23:31.123 --> 23:32.864
Like, greater than great.

23:32.984 --> 23:36.066
I didn't mention anything about the
sleep out at Camp Winnamonka, did I?

23:39.235 --> 23:40.764
Okay, are you ready?

23:44.643 --> 23:45.858
That's the guy.

23:46.620 --> 23:48.610
The guy who took a shot at you, right?

23:52.047 --> 23:53.207
Two shots.

23:54.581 --> 23:55.587
Of espresso.

23:56.947 --> 23:59.026
That's the guy I get my
coffee from every morning.

24:00.158 --> 24:01.436
Jimmy!

24:03.624 --> 24:06.079
Wait. What happened at Camp Winnamonka?

24:07.850 --> 24:08.855
Leaving.

24:12.119 --> 24:13.119
Hey.

24:14.981 --> 24:17.871
I got the results on that
white powder found on Baxter.

24:20.477 --> 24:22.366
Any luck jogging Palmer's memory?

24:22.390 --> 24:23.368
Working on it.

24:23.392 --> 24:25.386
Sounds like he's got a
serious case of brain freeze.

24:25.410 --> 24:27.017
Well, freeze can always thaw, Leon.

24:27.222 --> 24:28.222
Agent Gibbs!

24:28.510 --> 24:31.611
I've got Abby's results from that
white residue found on Baxter.

24:31.779 --> 24:33.081
It was efflorescence.

24:33.201 --> 24:35.517
Abby says that efflorescence
forms from water

24:35.637 --> 24:37.825
and calcium carbonate,
seep through concrete.

24:37.849 --> 24:38.934
Subgrade concrete.

24:39.025 --> 24:41.180
That's why the naval building
was being retrofitted.

24:41.204 --> 24:43.026
I saw it on the cement, not in the air.

24:43.377 --> 24:45.645
What would cause him to
breathe in a good amount?

24:46.817 --> 24:47.817
Drilling.

24:48.080 --> 24:49.839
Why would he be drilling into concrete?

24:51.948 --> 24:53.545
I guess that you're going to find out.

24:53.569 --> 24:55.854
Hey, grab your gear. We're going back.

24:59.348 --> 25:00.984
Move it down slowly.

25:01.910 --> 25:02.981
Keep going.

25:04.466 --> 25:06.130
Converting to a
three-dimensional image.

25:06.466 --> 25:08.142
And we get...

25:08.866 --> 25:09.688
rebar.

25:09.749 --> 25:12.832
Maybe he did not know or forgot
where he was supposed to be drilling.

25:12.870 --> 25:15.299
Well, maybe he was drilling
to place explosives.

25:15.351 --> 25:18.324
First time they hit the World Trade
Center, they aimed at the garage.

25:18.384 --> 25:20.289
Navy annex building's next door.

25:20.341 --> 25:21.501
Keep looking.

25:22.027 --> 25:24.226
Here is another hole.

25:24.540 --> 25:26.529
I thought that drill
belonged to one of my guys.

25:26.571 --> 25:29.353
No. Dead guy's prints are all over it.

25:33.840 --> 25:35.104
Okay, Tony.

25:37.420 --> 25:38.948
Keep moving it down.

25:39.788 --> 25:40.961
Keep going.

25:41.723 --> 25:42.904
Stop right there.

25:42.974 --> 25:43.974
Stop.

25:44.531 --> 25:45.649
Converting.

25:47.257 --> 25:48.304
Boss?

26:05.748 --> 26:08.952
It will take a very long
time to get fingerprints off

26:09.083 --> 26:11.911
- that unfortunate soul.
- How long, Mr. Harris?

26:12.145 --> 26:13.778
We're ready to cut out the section, but

26:13.810 --> 26:16.386
we have to wait for the structural
engineer. He's on his way.

26:16.444 --> 26:18.191
Thank you for your cooperation.

26:18.296 --> 26:21.649
Yeah, well, my... "cooperation"
just put us in the red on this job.

26:21.904 --> 26:23.685
If you'll back away, please.

26:24.299 --> 26:25.953
All right, jack it up short.

26:26.218 --> 26:27.301
Hey, get ready.

26:27.366 --> 26:28.762
We're making progress, Boss.

26:28.794 --> 26:30.479
We had one dead guy with two identities,

26:30.521 --> 26:32.982
and now we got another
dead guy with no identity.

26:33.109 --> 26:34.512
There has to be a connection.

26:34.592 --> 26:36.103
The body must have been dumped

26:36.223 --> 26:38.864
into the column form before
the concrete was poured.

26:39.066 --> 26:41.450
What was Mr. Baxter doing here
in the middle of the night?

26:41.492 --> 26:44.026
Without a jackhammer, he
couldn't get those bones out.

26:44.210 --> 26:45.445
He didn't have to, Duck.

26:45.516 --> 26:47.757
Because he had hydrofluoric acid.

26:47.798 --> 26:49.809
Hydrofluoric acid is highly corrosive.

26:50.191 --> 26:52.455
If he had managed to pour in that acid,

26:52.505 --> 26:54.930
it would have destroyed
all organic material.

26:55.014 --> 26:58.789
That would make DNA and dental
identification virtually impossible.

26:58.961 --> 27:00.690
Doesn't explain who killed Baxter.

27:01.014 --> 27:02.757
It's probably the same
guy who shot at me.

27:04.452 --> 27:07.300
Yes, well, I think we've done here.

27:09.396 --> 27:12.534
Foreman said it'd take a couple hours
to cut out that section of column.

27:12.702 --> 27:15.538
Gibbs wants me to stay behind and
maintain the chain of evidence.

27:15.789 --> 27:17.346
Yes, well, Mr. Palmer and I have

27:17.388 --> 27:20.745
to go pick up some unconventional
tools, don't we, Mr. Palmer?

27:21.034 --> 27:22.248
Mr. Palmer?

27:23.383 --> 27:24.513
Do you see him?

27:25.587 --> 27:26.796
- Who?
- It's him.

27:26.820 --> 27:28.316
He's right behind that truck.

27:28.361 --> 27:29.555
He's been watching me.

27:29.913 --> 27:31.148
Stay here.

27:49.707 --> 27:50.707
Hi, Gibbs.

27:52.149 --> 27:53.175
Impressive.

27:53.998 --> 27:57.161
Well, I learned from the master.
That would be you, the master.

27:57.307 --> 27:59.851
And I would be the apprentice.
The master's apprentice.

27:59.998 --> 28:02.015
The apprentice to the master.

28:04.038 --> 28:05.208
Okay, I said "Hi Gibbs"

28:05.232 --> 28:07.626
every ten seconds since I called
you down here five minutes ago.

28:07.650 --> 28:08.697
To tell me what?

28:08.820 --> 28:11.029
I took a photo of Baxter's head wound,

28:11.270 --> 28:13.281
using an oblique-angled light source.

28:13.429 --> 28:16.549
It makes the impression from the
blunt-forced weapon even clearer.

28:17.211 --> 28:18.593
Weapon of choice?

28:19.897 --> 28:20.936
Bolt cutters.

28:21.083 --> 28:22.083
Watch.

28:25.462 --> 28:26.622
Perfect fit.

28:26.793 --> 28:28.384
Lot of those on a construction site.

28:28.535 --> 28:31.016
You bring them to me, and I
will tell you exactly which one.

28:31.269 --> 28:32.902
And that's not all.

28:33.380 --> 28:35.956
Ducky found a microscopic piece of metal

28:36.209 --> 28:40.209
in the victim's wound.
It's 99 percent pure copper.

28:40.821 --> 28:42.264
0.4 phosphorous.

28:42.411 --> 28:44.115
I matched it to an electric cable.

28:44.350 --> 28:46.780
Do you know what the spot
price is for copper, Gibbs?

28:47.008 --> 28:48.369
I know our killer does.

28:50.090 --> 28:51.347
Thanks, Abs.

29:05.786 --> 29:09.660
Yeah, there was a time when I
thought I would be an archeologist.

29:09.884 --> 29:11.495
- Really?
- Yes.

29:11.666 --> 29:14.723
I was in the upper sixth at school.

29:15.222 --> 29:19.206
Summer holidays. I volunteered
for a dig in Tanzania.

29:19.624 --> 29:22.263
What happened? Why did you
decide to go to medical school?

29:22.397 --> 29:25.768
Well, although archeology
carried a certain romantic appeal,

29:25.911 --> 29:29.848
I soon realized it wasn't
in my bones, so to speak.

29:30.632 --> 29:34.424
You have to decide what's
in your bones, Mr. Palmer.

29:35.745 --> 29:38.414
- Not a spine.
- Nonsense. You just have a...

29:38.536 --> 29:40.903
a well-developed sense
of self-preservation.

29:41.188 --> 29:44.958
You're training to be a medical
examiner, not an NCIS field agent.

29:47.223 --> 29:48.647
I have no doubt

29:48.770 --> 29:52.542
that you have it in you
to die a hero's death.

29:52.850 --> 29:54.588
But for the time being, I'd appreciate

29:54.723 --> 29:57.730
it if you could stay alive
to help me examine the dead.

30:00.813 --> 30:03.797
Ducky, sorry to interrupt.
Need to borrow Palmer here.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.174
- What's happening?
- We have a suspect.

30:08.023 --> 30:09.973
A suspect? What did you find?

30:10.376 --> 30:12.826
Sometimes I worry about that young man.

30:13.843 --> 30:15.633
Now, let's have a look.

30:24.563 --> 30:26.704
Your bolt cutters, Enis.

30:28.045 --> 30:31.076
We got a blood match. You
should have used bleach.

30:34.961 --> 30:36.412
How did you know Rick Baxter?

30:41.686 --> 30:43.257
- I didn't.
- Right.

30:43.281 --> 30:46.454
You met him at the construction site
when you went to go steal something

30:46.478 --> 30:49.528
- in the middle of the night?
- With bolt cutters.

30:51.098 --> 30:54.560
What does copper sell
for these days, Enis?

31:00.598 --> 31:02.354
About four dollars a pound.

31:02.633 --> 31:05.150
- Worth killing for?
- It was self-defense, man.

31:05.411 --> 31:07.305
This guy was trying to kill me!

31:14.988 --> 31:18.163
There was some copper wire I
wanted up on the third floor.

31:18.284 --> 31:20.247
South side, and I went up there.

31:20.369 --> 31:23.585
And I saw him. He was drilling
a hole in the support column.

31:23.998 --> 31:26.202
You know, he spotted me, he went nuts.

31:26.226 --> 31:29.466
I ran, he came after me, and...
I thought he was gonna kill me.

31:32.248 --> 31:33.598
I had my cutters.

31:33.935 --> 31:37.638
I took a swing, I got lucky.
Caught him in the side of the head,

31:37.758 --> 31:39.308
and he staggered back.

31:40.005 --> 31:42.088
Just fell right off of the edge.

31:43.219 --> 31:46.066
I swear, that's it. If I didn't
do it, he would have killed me.

31:47.566 --> 31:49.859
Watley just confessed to killing Baxter.

31:49.883 --> 31:51.579
Claims it was self-defense.

31:52.317 --> 31:54.567
No more looking over your shoulder.

31:54.918 --> 31:57.668
- You got the wrong guy.
- He just confessed.

31:58.443 --> 32:00.538
He may have confessed to killing Baxter,

32:00.986 --> 32:04.124
but that is definitely not
the guy who tried to kill me.

32:12.817 --> 32:15.630
Look at the bright side, at
least we solved Baxter's murder.

32:15.654 --> 32:18.913
- Self-defense, not murder.
- So says our copper thief.

32:19.081 --> 32:20.080
And Abby.

32:20.104 --> 32:22.026
She analyzed footprints
and blood spatter

32:22.050 --> 32:24.351
we lifted from the garage:
Matches Watley's story.

32:24.375 --> 32:26.973
- I'm more concerned with Palmer.
- He said Watley is not the guy

32:26.997 --> 32:29.231
- who took a shot at him.
- Or stole Baxter's passport.

32:29.400 --> 32:31.450
And we still don't know who did.

32:32.002 --> 32:34.750
- You already knew that.
- Call every Baxter in the phone book.

32:34.774 --> 32:37.323
- See if I can find a relative.
- Help Tony.

32:37.444 --> 32:39.242
Re-check for a financial trail. Got it.

32:39.805 --> 32:40.855
Short leash.

32:41.408 --> 32:43.919
- Them or me?
- No ID on the mummy yet?

32:44.672 --> 32:47.745
- Abby's working on it.
- Then I'm sure you'll have one soon.

32:47.769 --> 32:49.878
- How's Palmer?
- I'll let you know.

33:06.034 --> 33:08.230
- Sorry.
- Never say that. You writing a letter?

33:09.600 --> 33:11.586
E- mail to my mom.

33:12.713 --> 33:15.069
I'm trying to figure out how
to describe what happened.

33:21.155 --> 33:22.493
How do you do it?

33:24.902 --> 33:26.152
Block out fear?

33:29.968 --> 33:31.002
You don't.

33:33.277 --> 33:35.027
It's what you do with it.

33:39.150 --> 33:41.429
What I'm doing with it is
nothing to write home about.

33:43.961 --> 33:46.600
The look in someone's
eyes can tell you a lot.

33:49.139 --> 33:50.489
What do mine tell?

33:55.149 --> 33:56.499
Hold off on that.

33:57.351 --> 33:59.601
You'll have something to tell them.

34:14.812 --> 34:17.092
Pull up a chair... We just
got to the East Coast felons.

34:17.116 --> 34:19.065
It's always my favorite part.

34:20.596 --> 34:22.512
- Facial recognition.
- Yep.

34:22.632 --> 34:25.590
- Where'd you get the face?
- When we found John Doe,

34:25.614 --> 34:28.893
there was nothing left, except
a shrunken, dried-up mummy.

34:29.214 --> 34:30.436
But then I realized,

34:30.927 --> 34:34.130
when he was first buried, he
must've had some kind of face.

34:34.292 --> 34:37.110
- When the concrete was poured...
- It left an imprint.

34:37.612 --> 34:38.612
Exactly.

34:39.210 --> 34:42.656
I scanned the pieces of concrete
that were surrounding his face,

34:42.982 --> 34:46.161
and then I had the computer look
for pieces that matched a template.

34:46.755 --> 34:48.830
Then I converted the
grid into a 3-D imprint.

34:48.949 --> 34:52.219
I scanned the imprint, added flesh
tones and estimated a brow line,

34:52.244 --> 34:54.094
and I made a photo likeness.

34:56.687 --> 34:57.687
Voilą!

34:59.142 --> 35:00.768
- You got a match.
- Not yet.

35:00.792 --> 35:04.369
But I'm searching every database I
can, and the software is crunching...

35:04.393 --> 35:05.643
You got a match.

35:06.926 --> 35:08.176
It didn't ding!

35:08.364 --> 35:10.936
My dinger didn't ding! My
dinger must be broken again.

35:12.396 --> 35:13.546
I got a match.

35:15.424 --> 35:18.276
A personal injury case from 1998.

35:18.977 --> 35:20.427
And the winner is...

35:21.418 --> 35:22.489
Rick Baxter.

35:23.069 --> 35:24.619
The real Rick Baxter.

35:24.643 --> 35:27.661
However, the real Rick Baxter had
his identity stolen by this man.

35:28.420 --> 35:29.478
Elevator guy.

35:29.502 --> 35:32.414
He didn't just steal Rick Baxter's
identity, he actually became Baxter.

35:32.695 --> 35:35.488
- And got rid of the original.
- Stuffed the body in concrete,

35:35.512 --> 35:38.360
and had to go back and get rid of
it before the retrofitters found it.

35:38.384 --> 35:40.840
- Why Baxter?
- Green.

35:41.490 --> 35:44.060
Baxter was injured at a
construction site in California.

35:44.084 --> 35:46.929
- Won a big settlement, 12 years ago.
- Two-point-one million,

35:47.051 --> 35:48.681
to be paid over 20 years.

35:48.803 --> 35:52.394
So Mr. Elevator Shaft Guy killed
Baxter, and then stole his identity.

35:52.934 --> 35:55.840
You need to keep him alive to
keep receiving the payments.

35:55.864 --> 35:57.217
It's kind of ironic.

35:57.241 --> 35:58.959
Get injured one day
at a construction site

35:58.983 --> 36:00.668
and then the next day
you're part of one.

36:00.692 --> 36:02.690
It still doesn't tell us
who took a shot at Palmer.

36:02.714 --> 36:05.764
He had a partner, McGee.
Check settlement payments.

36:13.915 --> 36:16.809
They've all been cashed at
the same currency exchange.

36:16.833 --> 36:18.712
I'll go there and see what I can dig up.

36:22.261 --> 36:25.011
Dr. Mallard, aren't we
forgetting something?

36:25.627 --> 36:27.598
I shall use the elevator, so...

36:27.943 --> 36:30.640
You get the body off the roof.

36:31.059 --> 36:33.601
And then we can move the
body back into the cage.

36:47.246 --> 36:48.896
It's all clear up there?

36:51.865 --> 36:52.865
Stop!

37:05.898 --> 37:09.345
I've been thinking and I... Well,
you're obviously the one to ask.

37:11.198 --> 37:12.807
Obvious in which way to ask what?

37:13.849 --> 37:16.394
- What I should have done.
- Done?

37:16.514 --> 37:18.353
If I had actually caught the guy?

37:19.712 --> 37:22.358
The shooter guy. What
should I have done?

37:25.405 --> 37:26.820
To protect yourself?

37:29.423 --> 37:30.992
Yeah, I guess so.

37:37.953 --> 37:41.043
This is a gun. I am
you. You are the shooter.

37:41.304 --> 37:42.304
Shoot me.

37:49.471 --> 37:50.471
You try.

37:59.057 --> 38:01.689
Well, perhaps it is best
that you did not catch him.

38:04.667 --> 38:05.985
- M.I.
- M.I.?

38:06.105 --> 38:07.231
M.I.

38:07.427 --> 38:10.377
The first two letters in
his first name were M.I.

38:10.509 --> 38:12.259
Ziva, you can let go now.

38:14.146 --> 38:17.956
All right. First name started
with an "M" and an "I".

38:18.076 --> 38:21.960
Last name started with an S-U-S.

38:22.441 --> 38:24.660
And the next letter was a...

38:28.500 --> 38:31.123
The next letter was...

38:31.436 --> 38:33.304
- Republic of Yugoslavia.
- That's it!

38:33.424 --> 38:34.974
That is the passport!

38:35.128 --> 38:37.767
Half of the settlement payments
were converted to Serbian dinars.

38:37.887 --> 38:40.523
80% of Serbian names end with an I-C.

38:42.282 --> 38:45.867
I- C... M-I... S-U-S... I-C.

38:46.049 --> 38:49.135
There are also a lot of Cs and Ks.

38:50.594 --> 38:51.771
M- I...

38:57.508 --> 39:00.699
Milos Suskavich! Milos Saca... Whatever!

39:00.873 --> 39:02.113
I can spell it!

39:05.605 --> 39:08.631
S- U-S-K-A-V-C-E-V-I-C!

39:08.751 --> 39:11.009
We heard it the first
three times, P-A-L-M-E-R.

39:11.462 --> 39:14.721
Milos Suskavcevic. A
native of central Serbia.

39:15.523 --> 39:17.362
Emigrated to the U.S. in 1998.

39:17.386 --> 39:19.809
Two years after Baxter
was awarded his settlement.

39:20.197 --> 39:22.969
- He come alone?
- He came with his brother, Tesla.

39:22.993 --> 39:23.994
Run him.

39:31.664 --> 39:32.914
Is that the guy?

39:33.921 --> 39:36.534
I don't know. He didn't
have a beard when I saw him.

39:38.433 --> 39:39.788
I'd have to see him in person.

39:39.812 --> 39:42.160
Worked out well for you
last time, didn't it, Palmer?

39:43.031 --> 39:44.054
Find him, McGee.

39:44.322 --> 39:47.962
I need to access Homeland
Security database for Tesla Susk...

39:49.679 --> 39:51.029
How it's spelled.

39:51.544 --> 39:54.723
The only address listed for
Tesla is another P.O. box.

39:54.747 --> 39:56.706
Checking the cell-phone records.

39:56.730 --> 39:58.556
- He's got a Blackberry.
- Trace it.

39:58.910 --> 40:00.060
Already on it.

40:01.508 --> 40:04.886
Junction of 95 and Arlington
Highway. It's another trailer park.

40:05.082 --> 40:06.632
Hiding in plain sight.

40:07.500 --> 40:10.068
- No. You stay.
- I can identify him.

40:10.188 --> 40:12.127
You will, when we bring him back.

40:56.842 --> 40:57.959
Clear!

41:02.657 --> 41:04.930
- Just missed him.
- He'll be back.

41:11.542 --> 41:12.892
Belgrade, Serbia.

41:13.865 --> 41:16.426
- First Class.
- Traveling on Baxter's dime.

41:16.843 --> 41:17.948
Or dinar.

41:19.296 --> 41:20.846
McGee, check the park.

41:20.967 --> 41:22.400
- DiNozzo!
- Boss!

41:22.424 --> 41:24.850
Check the manager's
office. Ziva, stay here.

41:40.820 --> 41:43.418
- What are you doing?
- I thought I could help.

41:43.573 --> 41:45.829
What don't you understand
about the word "stay".

41:46.368 --> 41:48.705
Stay! Palmer, you stay in the car.

42:26.699 --> 42:27.747
Boy...

42:57.813 --> 42:58.912
Drop the gun!

43:02.123 --> 43:03.157
Put the gun down!

43:08.075 --> 43:11.206
- Get on the ground! Now!
- Hands behind your back.

43:13.746 --> 43:15.896
What the hell were you thinking?!

43:16.617 --> 43:18.171
I did not get out of the car.

43:18.662 --> 43:20.765
Don't ever do it again.

43:25.363 --> 43:28.413
Now you got something to
write home about, Palmer.
