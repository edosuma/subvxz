WEBVTT

00:02.100 --> 00:04.400
Previously,
on "Hit the Floor"...

00:04.400 --> 00:07.100
The heart becomes weaker
and less able to pump blood.

00:07.100 --> 00:10.000
Not the heart.
My heart.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.233
Raquel!

00:11.233 --> 00:13.433
I see now how much
I do want kids.

00:13.433 --> 00:17.267
It's unlikely you'll ever
be able to have a child.

00:18.267 --> 00:19.967
You have a sister?

00:19.967 --> 00:22.300
There's this
private investigator I use.

00:22.300 --> 00:23.667
Maybe he can help you
find her.

00:23.667 --> 00:26.233
Terrence and Jelena
flipped Derek.

00:26.233 --> 00:27.933
He's backing them
with the league now.

00:27.933 --> 00:29.500
You've got
24 hours to accept,

00:29.500 --> 00:31.800
or we're withdrawing
our offer.

00:31.800 --> 00:33.400
Everyone's coming
for me,

00:33.400 --> 00:35.500
and the one person I trust
doesn't trust me.

00:35.500 --> 00:37.267
And Lionel's out there
thinking she has no one.

00:37.267 --> 00:38.700
Well, what's the worst
she could do?

00:38.700 --> 00:41.233
My seat at the arena
is being threatened.

00:41.233 --> 00:43.433
You're gonna help make sure
I keep it.

00:43.433 --> 00:44.433
Hmm.

00:44.433 --> 00:46.700
Sloane Hayes
didn't kill Olivia.

00:46.700 --> 00:47.733
I did.

00:47.733 --> 00:50.533
I sentence you
to 20 years

00:50.533 --> 00:52.433
in a state facility.

00:53.367 --> 00:54.667
Unh!
You killed my wife!

01:17.567 --> 01:18.633
German!

01:18.633 --> 01:19.867
24-year-old male,

01:19.867 --> 01:21.367
stab wound
to the abdomen.

01:21.367 --> 01:22.700
B.P. 60 over palp.

01:22.700 --> 01:23.767
Oh, my God.

01:23.767 --> 01:26.267
German...

01:26.267 --> 01:28.133
German, I'm here.
He's a prisoner.

01:45.600 --> 01:47.800
Hey.
Heard you came by.

01:48.933 --> 01:50.333
Listen, I hope
you don't think

01:50.333 --> 01:52.133
my going to the board
without you

01:52.133 --> 01:55.133
had anything to do--
It's fine, Jude.

01:55.133 --> 01:57.067
I get that there
have been questions.

01:58.667 --> 02:00.733
We're good.

02:01.733 --> 02:04.500
Okay.
Well...

02:04.500 --> 02:06.167
I heard about
Jelena and Terrence's

02:06.167 --> 02:08.933
24-hour ultimatum
to the league.

02:08.933 --> 02:11.133
We're gonna fight this,
together.

02:11.133 --> 02:13.867
We are.
With a little help.

02:14.733 --> 02:15.967
Help?
What help?

02:15.967 --> 02:17.967
Hello, son.

02:26.567 --> 02:29.500
Excuse me, Nurse,
this woman is a heart patient.

02:29.500 --> 02:30.667
This is Cardiology,
Kyle.

02:30.667 --> 02:31.900
Everyone here
is a heart patient.

02:31.900 --> 02:34.733
Nurse--
Can I help you, ladies?

02:34.733 --> 02:36.867
Well, hello...
Doctor.

02:37.733 --> 02:39.067
Which one are you?

02:39.067 --> 02:41.733
"McDreamy"?
"McSteamy"?

02:41.733 --> 02:43.800
"McHung"?

02:45.100 --> 02:47.733
I think I need a stronger
pain medication.

02:47.733 --> 02:48.767
I'm a patient
of Dr. Ward's.

02:48.767 --> 02:50.233
I am not a patient here,

02:50.233 --> 02:52.700
but I would wear a backless
paper gown for you.

02:52.700 --> 02:54.900
I see.
Mm-hmm.

02:57.067 --> 03:00.367
Raquel Saldana.
That's a beautiful name.

03:02.067 --> 03:05.100
Um... we'll run
some tests,

03:05.100 --> 03:07.500
gauge, uh, how much stronger
of a dose you need.

03:07.500 --> 03:08.833
Thank you.

03:08.833 --> 03:10.900
Yeah.

03:13.867 --> 03:15.900
Mm-mmm.

03:15.900 --> 03:18.133
Someone wants more than
their dosage adjusted.

03:18.133 --> 03:20.167
Kyle, stop!

03:20.167 --> 03:22.467
We're in a hospital.
Exactly.

03:22.467 --> 03:24.833
Perfect place
to play "Doctor."

03:25.733 --> 03:28.067
Mm-mm.

03:28.067 --> 03:29.633
Are you crazy?
What were you thinking

03:29.633 --> 03:30.967
getting Oscar released?

03:30.967 --> 03:33.300
Relax, I still have him
on a choke chain.

03:33.300 --> 03:35.267
If he so much as looks
at me the wrong way,

03:35.267 --> 03:37.200
I'll use the proof I have
of his racketeering

03:37.200 --> 03:38.767
to put him right back
in his cage.

03:38.767 --> 03:40.633
No, it just seems...
drastic.

03:40.633 --> 03:42.367
Because it is.

03:42.367 --> 03:45.567
Do you think I'd spring him
if I didn't have to?

03:45.567 --> 03:48.633
Terrence and Jelena
are coming at us, hard.

03:48.633 --> 03:51.067
If anyone can stop them,
it's him.

03:51.900 --> 03:53.933
Hate Oscar all we want,

03:53.933 --> 03:55.300
but he could mean
the difference between

03:55.300 --> 03:57.300
us keeping the team
or losing it.

04:08.867 --> 04:10.367
Hey.
Hey.

04:12.067 --> 04:14.600
Heard from Raquel?

04:14.600 --> 04:16.133
Yeah.

04:18.433 --> 04:20.933
You never know what life's
gonna throw at you.

04:22.267 --> 04:25.333
I got some good news
this morning.

04:25.333 --> 04:27.300
My doctor
cleared me to play.

04:27.300 --> 04:30.533
Terrence,
that's fantastic.
Yeah!

04:30.533 --> 04:31.600
How about you?

04:31.600 --> 04:34.200
How did it got
at the OB/GYN?

04:34.200 --> 04:37.133
I have to go
take some tests.

04:37.133 --> 04:38.900
I thought you already
took the tests?

04:47.433 --> 04:48.600
Hello?

04:50.300 --> 04:51.933
When?

04:53.600 --> 04:55.233
Thanks.

04:59.567 --> 05:01.767
What is it?

05:01.767 --> 05:04.067
Oscar's out of jail.

05:10.567 --> 05:12.700
Hope you didn't mind
sleeping in the pool house.

05:12.700 --> 05:15.067
No room at the inn.

05:15.067 --> 05:17.133
That's a lie.
I'm okay if you minded.

05:18.333 --> 05:19.433
I've prepared
a statement from you,

05:19.433 --> 05:21.200
and I sent it
to our PR team.

05:21.200 --> 05:23.900
You can read what you said
in the newspaper.

05:23.900 --> 05:25.267
I'm headed to the arena.

05:25.267 --> 05:26.967
You keep working on
the league from here.

05:26.967 --> 05:28.333
Sit down, Lionel.

05:36.933 --> 05:39.433
Looking for this?

05:39.433 --> 05:41.767
Did you think I wouldn't
check my own safe,

05:41.767 --> 05:44.233
or have
a combination override?

05:45.100 --> 05:47.167
Ever heard of copies?

05:47.167 --> 05:51.333
You mean the ones upstairs,
or your place in Malibu?

05:51.333 --> 05:52.800
And those digital copies,

05:52.800 --> 05:55.867
well, files can be
corrupted.

05:55.867 --> 05:57.567
You might want
to check your computer.

06:07.400 --> 06:11.067
Let's have a chat,
shall we?

06:18.500 --> 06:20.333
Why is this taking
so long?

06:20.333 --> 06:21.533
At least it gave me
some time

06:21.533 --> 06:23.633
to get some intel
on Dominic.

06:23.633 --> 06:24.933
Who's Dominic?

06:24.933 --> 06:27.067
Your doctor/sex fantasy.

06:27.067 --> 06:29.633
He's divorced, from Orlando,
works out at Gold's,

06:29.633 --> 06:31.500
leg days are Mondays
and Wednesdays...

06:31.500 --> 06:32.867
Uh, Raquel?

06:32.867 --> 06:34.467
I'm sorry
we have to keep you.

06:34.467 --> 06:35.667
There were
some questions,

06:35.667 --> 06:37.300
and we had to run
more lab work.

06:37.300 --> 06:39.267
That's fine, we have
some questions of our own,

06:39.267 --> 06:42.767
starting with a certain
sex bomb in scrubs.

06:42.767 --> 06:46.300
Your heart is weakening
faster than we anticipated.

06:47.700 --> 06:49.733
Actually, you need
to be admitted.

06:52.133 --> 06:54.567
For how long?

06:54.567 --> 06:55.900
Raquel, I'm sorry.

07:07.433 --> 07:08.800
Dr. Manley.
Yes?

07:08.800 --> 07:11.300
Sloane Hayes,
we spoke earlier.

07:11.300 --> 07:13.067
How's German?
Well, he's awake now.

07:13.067 --> 07:14.967
The next 24 hours,
we'll watch for infection.

07:14.967 --> 07:16.767
But his prognosis is good.

07:16.767 --> 07:18.967
Thank God--
can I see him?

07:18.967 --> 07:20.333
Well, he's under
police supervision.

07:23.800 --> 07:25.667
Kyle's here.

07:27.367 --> 07:30.733
She came for German,
let's go tell her the good news.

07:31.867 --> 07:33.367
German lost
a lot of blood.

07:33.367 --> 07:36.600
It was touch-and-go
for a minute...

07:56.133 --> 07:58.900
A copy of your sister's
foster care record.

07:58.900 --> 08:00.733
There's not much there.

08:00.733 --> 08:01.967
When she was
taken out of care,

08:01.967 --> 08:03.267
no paperwork was filed.

08:03.267 --> 08:05.900
She basically
dropped out of the system.

08:06.867 --> 08:09.733
So... you find people.

08:10.600 --> 08:12.467
Find her.

08:12.467 --> 08:13.633
It's not that simple.

08:13.633 --> 08:16.733
Her last known
foster home was...

08:16.733 --> 08:18.767
all over the news
at the time.

08:18.767 --> 08:21.200
The state had
to shut it down.

08:23.333 --> 08:25.200
I mean,
can't you dig deeper?

08:25.200 --> 08:28.300
I've gone through
all the legal channels.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.200
Digging deeper means
breaking some laws.

08:32.233 --> 08:34.433
It's gonna cost.

08:34.433 --> 08:36.300
I've got the cash.

08:38.167 --> 08:39.867
I just saw Raquel
a few days ago.

08:39.867 --> 08:41.067
She was fine.

08:41.067 --> 08:42.800
Well, hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy

08:42.800 --> 08:44.267
is a progressive
disease.

08:44.267 --> 08:46.067
The harder the heart's
forced to work,

08:46.067 --> 08:48.067
the faster
some patients can decline.

08:48.067 --> 08:49.833
New things come up
all the time.

08:49.833 --> 08:51.933
New treatments,
new medicines.

08:51.933 --> 08:53.133
What about
a transplant?

08:53.133 --> 08:56.433
We've explored
every option with her.

08:56.433 --> 08:58.600
There's nothing more
we can do.

08:58.600 --> 09:00.067
She's in hospice.

09:00.067 --> 09:02.500
We'll make sure she's
as comfortable as possible.

09:07.367 --> 09:08.867
Sloane?

09:08.867 --> 09:11.133
Did something happen
with German?

09:11.133 --> 09:13.833
It's Raquel,
she's here.

09:16.333 --> 09:18.267
She's dying.

09:29.633 --> 09:30.633
Hey.

09:30.633 --> 09:32.233
Derek Roman?

09:32.233 --> 09:33.567
Yeah.

09:33.567 --> 09:35.600
Okay if I talk to him?

09:35.600 --> 09:37.467
Thanks, okay.

09:37.467 --> 09:39.800
Appreciate it.

09:42.200 --> 09:43.867
Hey, coach.

09:45.567 --> 09:47.067
What're you doing here?

09:47.067 --> 09:48.200
I know.

09:48.200 --> 09:51.500
Last time between us,
it got messy.

09:51.500 --> 09:53.067
But nobody deserves this.

09:55.633 --> 09:58.067
All right.

09:58.067 --> 10:00.033
You're only here because
you were there for Ahsha,

10:00.033 --> 10:01.767
so now I'm here for you.

10:06.433 --> 10:08.100
Damn, Chase.

10:08.100 --> 10:11.033
Man, what he did--
Doesn't matter what he did.

10:12.067 --> 10:14.200
Matters
what he didn't do.

10:16.100 --> 10:17.833
I wish
he finished the job.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.800
You don't mean that.

10:20.800 --> 10:23.033
Go ahead,
I can't reach 'em.

10:24.300 --> 10:25.767
But you could.

10:27.167 --> 10:28.800
Just bump into it
and roll 'em over

10:28.800 --> 10:30.267
on your way out.

10:31.800 --> 10:34.000
You really wanna help me?

10:35.867 --> 10:37.300
Help me die.

10:39.833 --> 10:41.467
She's weak,
and she's pale.

10:41.467 --> 10:43.000
But she's not
in any pain.

10:43.900 --> 10:45.067
Miguel's with her now.

10:45.067 --> 10:47.000
What's going
to happen to him?

10:47.000 --> 10:48.100
His daddy's taking him.

10:48.100 --> 10:49.967
Hopefully
Miguel can teach him

10:49.967 --> 10:52.167
how to be a man.

10:54.200 --> 10:56.367
She'll be happy to see
your smiling face.

11:07.100 --> 11:10.233
"The field was
filled with fireflies.

11:10.233 --> 11:12.800
"shining across
the tall grass

11:12.800 --> 11:15.733
like stars dancing
in the night."

11:15.733 --> 11:18.167
That's pretty.

11:18.167 --> 11:21.267
It is pretty neat, huh?

11:23.167 --> 11:26.867
Mommy's going somewhere
just like this.

11:26.867 --> 11:28.467
Someplace
it's never dark,

11:28.467 --> 11:32.700
and the fireflies' light
lets me watch over you.

11:32.700 --> 11:34.833
Always.

11:34.833 --> 11:37.067
Can I come with you?

11:40.067 --> 11:41.700
When you miss me,

11:41.700 --> 11:44.600
you can close your eyes

11:44.600 --> 11:47.633
and be there
with me, okay?

11:47.633 --> 11:49.467
Okay.

11:51.833 --> 11:53.300
Ahsha.

11:53.300 --> 11:55.100
Oh, no,
please don't.

11:55.100 --> 11:57.133
I'd love
to hear the rest.

12:02.067 --> 12:06.167
"The air smelled sweet,
stirred by a warm breeze

12:06.167 --> 12:10.100
that rustled softly
through the grass."

12:11.367 --> 12:15.333
"And I knew there was
no place I'd rather be

12:15.333 --> 12:19.300
than in that
field of fireflies."

12:24.233 --> 12:26.600
Derek, I can't spend
20 years in prison.

12:28.367 --> 12:29.367
Help me.

12:31.967 --> 12:33.633
Please.

12:38.700 --> 12:40.500
No.

12:40.500 --> 12:43.667
If you hurt yourself,
you hurt Ahsha.

12:43.667 --> 12:45.867
I've got to protect her.

12:45.867 --> 12:47.367
Just like
you always did.

12:51.367 --> 12:54.367
You keep
watching out for her.

12:57.367 --> 12:58.400
I will.

13:05.567 --> 13:07.467
See you later.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.400
Hey.

13:23.733 --> 13:25.467
How's Raquel?

13:27.433 --> 13:29.633
Ahsha and Sloane
are with her now.

13:32.067 --> 13:35.700
I have to focus
on something, so...

13:35.700 --> 13:37.900
I've been trying to take
the temperature of the league.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.800
And?

13:39.800 --> 13:42.067
And nothing.

13:42.067 --> 13:43.900
I do know
the more time Oscar has,

13:43.900 --> 13:45.367
the more he can
undermine us.

13:45.367 --> 13:47.067
We already put
everything on the table

13:47.067 --> 13:48.600
and even put
a ticking clock on it.

13:48.600 --> 13:50.767
What more can we do?

13:50.767 --> 13:53.067
Move the clock up.

13:53.067 --> 13:56.267
We need to pressure
the league to make a decision

13:56.267 --> 13:58.567
before we lose
any more leverage.

14:00.133 --> 14:02.067
Do it.

14:10.333 --> 14:12.667
Miss Howard.
Hello.

14:12.667 --> 14:14.267
How are you?

14:14.267 --> 14:15.867
Underwhelmed.

14:15.867 --> 14:18.767
Terrence and I were hoping
to have a decision by now.

14:18.767 --> 14:21.167
I hope to be
giving you one.

14:21.167 --> 14:23.167
I assume you've heard
Oscar's out of jail.

14:23.167 --> 14:25.400
Oscar managing to be
released from prison

14:25.400 --> 14:28.367
doesn't change the fact
that the Kincades need to go.

14:28.367 --> 14:31.333
Can't say I disagree.
Good.

14:31.333 --> 14:32.967
Because we aren't about
to play another round

14:32.967 --> 14:34.833
of musical chairs
for this team.

14:34.833 --> 14:37.867
The league needs
to make a decision now.

14:37.867 --> 14:39.467
Is it the Kincades or us?

14:39.467 --> 14:42.167
Hold just one minute,
would you?

14:43.667 --> 14:46.533
Before you say another word,
let me remind you, Adam.

14:46.533 --> 14:49.333
I've been exonerated
of all charges.

14:49.333 --> 14:51.567
Try to separate me
from my team,

14:51.567 --> 14:55.067
and I can make things
real messy.

14:55.067 --> 14:57.933
For the league.

14:57.933 --> 14:59.400
And you.

15:04.667 --> 15:06.400
Miss Howard.

15:06.400 --> 15:08.833
The league thanks you
for your interest.

15:08.833 --> 15:10.200
But our hands are tied.

15:10.200 --> 15:13.633
The team belongs
to Oscar Kincade.

15:18.567 --> 15:20.600
They're going
with Oscar.

15:30.433 --> 15:33.467
Yeah, all right,
thank you, I appreciate it.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.167
The league is
saying that...

15:36.167 --> 15:37.767
Lionel's out.

15:37.767 --> 15:39.867
Terrence and Jelena?

15:39.867 --> 15:42.167
Oscar.

15:43.100 --> 15:44.633
Sloane, look,
thanks to you,

15:44.633 --> 15:46.267
Oscar went to prison.

15:46.267 --> 15:47.700
His reputation is
destroyed.

15:47.700 --> 15:49.867
Everybody knows
who and what he is now.

15:49.867 --> 15:53.067
Who and what he is
is the owner of the Devils.

15:53.067 --> 15:54.233
Still.

16:01.900 --> 16:03.933
Hey, great news.

16:03.933 --> 16:06.467
No for sale,
we got...

16:06.467 --> 16:08.933
the team.

16:08.933 --> 16:10.300
Oscar's got the team.

16:12.700 --> 16:14.167
He got off leash.

16:21.067 --> 16:22.700
How?

16:24.067 --> 16:25.200
What does
that mean for us?

16:27.267 --> 16:29.567
Jude, I've been
antagonizing him for months,

16:29.567 --> 16:32.700
and you left him
in prison to rot.

16:34.467 --> 16:36.067
I don't know
what it means for us,

16:36.067 --> 16:38.133
but it's not
gonna be good.

16:54.067 --> 16:56.433
Terrence, Jelena.

16:59.167 --> 17:01.300
Thank you for coming.

17:01.300 --> 17:03.067
Thanks for
the invitation.

17:03.067 --> 17:07.300
I'm sorry my wife made you
feel so unwelcome here.

17:07.300 --> 17:10.500
To me, you're family.

17:10.500 --> 17:12.333
And my first
order of business is

17:12.333 --> 17:13.633
bringing you back
into the fold.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.767
Terrence, I heard
the team doctor

17:15.767 --> 17:17.100
cleared you to play.

17:17.100 --> 17:19.600
Next game... I want you
out there hustling.

17:19.600 --> 17:22.267
And you, my dear,
you need to be

17:22.267 --> 17:23.933
front and center
in halftime,

17:23.933 --> 17:25.233
where you belong.

17:27.367 --> 17:31.067
So you're not upset
we tried to buy the team?

17:31.067 --> 17:32.967
Of course I am.

17:32.967 --> 17:35.100
But I don't blame you.

17:35.100 --> 17:37.667
Not with Lionel
in my seat.

17:37.667 --> 17:39.667
Besides,
if I expect people

17:39.667 --> 17:42.267
to wipe the slate
clean for me,

17:42.267 --> 17:44.733
I gotta be willing
to wipe it clean for them.

17:46.167 --> 17:49.667
Of course,
as a token of goodwill,

17:49.667 --> 17:52.100
I'll want you
to sell me the arena.

17:58.733 --> 18:02.233
We're all for a truce.

18:02.233 --> 18:04.300
But not at the expense
of the arena.

18:05.800 --> 18:07.433
If we can't own the team,

18:07.433 --> 18:10.467
we need something that
gives us a seat at the table.

18:12.100 --> 18:13.333
And if you mean
what you're saying

18:13.333 --> 18:15.400
about a truce,

18:15.400 --> 18:17.433
it shouldn't be
an issue.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.533
Welcome home.

18:45.667 --> 18:47.333
I saw Raquel.

18:49.800 --> 18:51.767
How's she doing?

18:55.900 --> 18:57.533
Not well.

19:01.133 --> 19:03.367
There were
other people.

19:05.600 --> 19:07.467
I know.

19:07.467 --> 19:09.333
I wanna do
something for her.

19:09.333 --> 19:11.533
You are.
You're there for her.

19:11.533 --> 19:15.433
I mean more than
just sit at her bedside.

19:15.433 --> 19:18.067
She helped me make it
through tryouts.

19:19.633 --> 19:23.467
And if I hadn't
been a Devil girl,

19:23.467 --> 19:25.267
I never would've met you.

19:46.133 --> 19:48.233
No, no, Ahsha.

19:50.067 --> 19:51.467
That's not what you need.

19:55.333 --> 19:56.967
Come here.

20:18.267 --> 20:19.800
German.

20:23.900 --> 20:25.000
I heard.

20:26.300 --> 20:28.300
What're you doing here?

20:28.300 --> 20:30.933
Is it--
Just some tests.

20:33.233 --> 20:35.633
I'm glad you made it
through surgery.

20:35.633 --> 20:37.667
That makes one of us.

20:37.667 --> 20:40.433
German...
I'm going to prison.

20:42.867 --> 20:44.300
And you'd rather die.

20:55.467 --> 20:58.100
It's not about
avoiding prison.

20:58.100 --> 20:59.800
It's about
avoiding shame.

21:02.667 --> 21:05.067
Your life still
means something.

21:07.767 --> 21:10.067
Life is too important
to just throw it away.

21:10.067 --> 21:11.633
Not my life.

21:12.700 --> 21:14.700
Not anymore.

21:14.700 --> 21:17.933
I've got Olivia's blood
on my hands forever.

21:19.267 --> 21:21.567
I know that's not
the whole story.

21:21.567 --> 21:26.500
Olivia put a lot of people
in a lot of bad positions.

21:26.500 --> 21:28.100
Including me.

21:28.100 --> 21:30.867
Any one of us could've had
this awful thing happen.

21:36.700 --> 21:40.267
One moment doesn't
define you.

21:40.267 --> 21:43.333
The people
around you define you.

21:43.333 --> 21:45.967
And you're loved.

21:47.700 --> 21:49.767
If you're gonna
dwell on something,

21:49.767 --> 21:50.967
dwell on that.

21:58.333 --> 22:00.133
Hey, how was your walk?

22:00.133 --> 22:01.600
I'm exhausted.

22:01.600 --> 22:03.567
Well, I got something

22:03.567 --> 22:06.867
that'll put a little gas
back in your tank.

22:08.133 --> 22:10.667
That's--
Your sexy-ass doctor.

22:12.067 --> 22:13.300
And his sexy ass.

22:13.300 --> 22:14.333
Oh, and this is his--

22:14.333 --> 22:16.533
Oh, my God, Kyle,

22:16.533 --> 22:17.767
where did you--

22:17.767 --> 22:19.533
I paid an orderly 20 bucks

22:19.533 --> 22:22.633
to sneak me into
the doctor's locker room.

22:22.633 --> 22:24.500
It was for
a good cause.

22:24.500 --> 22:26.133
Now you can enjoy
his bedside manner

22:26.133 --> 22:27.200
all night long.

22:27.200 --> 22:28.533
You're ridiculous.

22:28.533 --> 22:29.833
You know me.

22:29.833 --> 22:31.533
Can't take things
too serious.

22:33.867 --> 22:36.100
I do know you.

23:00.567 --> 23:03.967
We took a hit this time
with the team.

23:03.967 --> 23:06.233
It's a loss.

23:06.233 --> 23:08.533
We still win.

23:08.533 --> 23:11.967
We can start a family.

23:11.967 --> 23:14.533
I see you're thinking
the same thing.

23:16.433 --> 23:18.467
Terrence.

23:18.467 --> 23:20.567
Hmm?

23:22.700 --> 23:24.400
It's not a good time.

23:24.400 --> 23:26.933
You just got back
on court,

23:26.933 --> 23:29.500
and I've got so much work
to do with the Devil Girls.

23:29.500 --> 23:30.833
It'll never be
a perfect time.

23:31.933 --> 23:33.967
The Girls will
have your back.

23:35.233 --> 23:37.067
It's not that simple.

23:40.067 --> 23:42.100
I wanna have a family
with you, Jelena.

23:43.567 --> 23:46.600
I want a boy that plays ball
and a girl that dances.

23:46.600 --> 23:48.333
Or the other way around.

23:48.333 --> 23:50.233
I don't care.

23:50.233 --> 23:54.400
It's part of you
and part of me.

23:54.400 --> 23:56.767
I need this.

23:57.700 --> 23:59.767
You understand?

24:01.967 --> 24:03.600
I understand.

24:26.333 --> 24:28.367
I spoke to Raquel.

24:29.833 --> 24:31.900
She's...

24:31.900 --> 24:33.533
a special person.

24:33.533 --> 24:35.933
Yeah.

24:35.933 --> 24:37.433
How're you doing?

24:40.100 --> 24:41.833
I know.

24:43.333 --> 24:45.900
There's only so many
vending machines to smash

24:45.900 --> 24:48.233
in this place.

25:02.300 --> 25:03.633
I don't wanna leave.

25:05.167 --> 25:06.700
We have to.

25:06.700 --> 25:08.633
We have a game.

25:08.633 --> 25:10.400
We'll be back.

25:10.400 --> 25:12.667
What about
the next game?

25:12.667 --> 25:17.100
Are we really gonna
keep working for Oscar?

25:17.100 --> 25:18.867
Let's just get
through tonight.

25:18.867 --> 25:20.800
Tomorrow...

25:24.933 --> 25:27.733
The sooner we leave,
the sooner we get back.

25:35.733 --> 25:38.067
What about when
you yelled at Jelena

25:38.067 --> 25:39.333
in front of everyone
at tryouts?

25:39.333 --> 25:40.767
You were all,
"Shut up, bitch!"

25:42.467 --> 25:45.167
I don't remember it
that way.

25:45.167 --> 25:47.067
Well, that's
what it felt like.

25:47.067 --> 25:49.233
Ugh, heaven.

25:49.233 --> 25:51.233
You know what I loved?

25:51.233 --> 25:53.800
Blasting Jesse
with champagne.

25:53.800 --> 25:55.300
Ooh, that was epic.

25:55.300 --> 25:57.800
He looked like he was
sexually assaulted

25:57.800 --> 25:59.333
by a fire hydrant.

25:59.333 --> 26:01.400
What about
when I almost drove us

26:01.400 --> 26:02.567
into the front
of that 7-11?

26:02.567 --> 26:04.100
No, no, no,
I can laugh

26:04.100 --> 26:07.100
about everything,
but not your driving.

26:07.100 --> 26:08.300
Come on.

26:08.300 --> 26:10.567
No way, you drive
like a maniac.

26:10.567 --> 26:12.733
And you always
get us lost.

26:18.067 --> 26:20.633
I'm gonna be lost
without you.

26:25.333 --> 26:26.967
Crazy idea.

26:26.967 --> 26:29.400
What if we went for
one more drive right now?

26:29.400 --> 26:31.867
Totally spontaneous.

26:31.867 --> 26:35.900
I promise I won't
drive like a maniac.

26:38.667 --> 26:41.467
I wouldn't mind getting
out of here for a little while.

26:45.067 --> 26:47.067
Why not?

26:51.667 --> 26:53.300
Ladies and gentlemen,

26:53.300 --> 26:54.800
please welcome back

26:54.800 --> 26:55.900
Number 18,

26:55.900 --> 26:57.800
Terrence Wall!

27:27.633 --> 27:29.400
That's halftime, folks!

27:29.400 --> 27:30.900
Devils are up by 20!

27:30.900 --> 27:33.467
Finish up, all right,
good job, good job.

27:47.400 --> 27:49.533
I'm Sloane Hayes.

27:49.533 --> 27:52.800
Director of the Devil Girls.

27:52.800 --> 27:56.267
The Devil Girls are
going dark tonight.

27:56.267 --> 27:59.867
Out of respect for
Raquel Saldana.

27:59.867 --> 28:03.400
Raquel is
a Devil Girl alum

28:03.400 --> 28:06.667
who is battling
a serious illness.

28:08.467 --> 28:11.367
Her incredible beauty

28:11.367 --> 28:13.600
has touched my heart

28:13.600 --> 28:15.167
and the hearts
of so many

28:15.167 --> 28:16.533
in the Devils' family.

28:18.900 --> 28:22.567
If you could
please join me

28:22.567 --> 28:24.267
in a moment

28:24.267 --> 28:26.833
of silent unity.

28:33.767 --> 28:38.167
When you said,
let's go for a ride,

28:38.167 --> 28:42.400
I didn't think
it would be an empty field.

28:42.400 --> 28:44.433
Not so empty.

28:51.100 --> 28:52.800
Fireflies.

31:17.600 --> 31:19.733
You guys...

31:34.533 --> 31:35.767
There's just over two minutes

31:35.767 --> 31:37.467
left in the game,
Devils fans.

31:39.533 --> 31:41.667
I'm tired of
waiting, Oscar.

31:41.667 --> 31:45.067
You have plans for me,
what are they?

31:45.067 --> 31:48.233
While I was made
to suffer in prison,

31:48.233 --> 31:52.533
you got to enjoy
the perks of being my wife.

31:52.533 --> 31:57.733
It's time I got to enjoy
having you as my wife.

32:00.700 --> 32:04.700
We won't just be
sharing a home.

32:04.700 --> 32:07.800
We'll be
sharing a bed.

32:07.800 --> 32:10.400
Make no mistake,
Lionel.

32:10.400 --> 32:14.867
Whatever future
you may have,

32:14.867 --> 32:16.867
I'm it.

32:20.600 --> 32:21.733
Good game.

32:21.733 --> 32:23.400
Hey.

32:24.667 --> 32:26.067
Hey.

32:26.067 --> 32:27.367
What're you doing here?

32:27.367 --> 32:29.200
I got a lead
on your sister.

32:29.200 --> 32:31.567
And I had
to come down.

32:31.567 --> 32:33.467
Because I found her.

32:41.067 --> 32:44.067
We have a fan downstairs
ready to take you.

32:56.967 --> 33:00.200
I'm ready.

33:13.967 --> 33:15.533
Do you think
it's like that?

33:17.133 --> 33:18.400
That what's like that?

33:19.667 --> 33:22.300
The field?
Fireflies?

33:24.167 --> 33:28.067
I think it's whatever
we want it to be.

33:33.367 --> 33:36.167
You've come so far
since the day we met.

33:37.133 --> 33:39.067
Ahsha,
you're a woman now.

33:40.300 --> 33:42.400
I've learned
from the best.

33:44.333 --> 33:45.600
That's...

33:45.600 --> 33:48.133
the highest...

33:50.500 --> 33:51.500
Raquel?

33:52.800 --> 33:54.500
Raquel?

34:00.900 --> 34:02.200
What happened?

34:02.200 --> 34:03.567
Heart failure.

34:03.567 --> 34:05.167
It's not good.

34:05.167 --> 34:06.967
We never should've
taken her outside.

34:06.967 --> 34:10.067
Her doctor said it had
nothing to do with that.

34:10.067 --> 34:12.967
It's just...
it's just her time.

34:18.600 --> 34:21.133
How is she?

34:21.133 --> 34:24.567
Uh, she asked if you'd
take a walk with Miguel.

34:26.533 --> 34:28.600
Hey, uh...

34:28.600 --> 34:30.333
I saw a hoop outside.

34:30.333 --> 34:32.067
Let's go work on that
jump shot, what do you say?

34:33.733 --> 34:36.133
All right,
okay, bud.

34:52.933 --> 34:55.300
I'll go.

35:10.233 --> 35:12.833
You look like hell.

35:12.833 --> 35:15.067
Shut up, bitch.

35:22.367 --> 35:24.933
Last time we were
in a hospital together,

35:24.933 --> 35:29.267
I was talking you through
giving birth to Miguel.

35:30.767 --> 35:33.300
More like
yelling at me.

35:33.300 --> 35:36.067
Encouragement comes
in many forms.

35:40.200 --> 35:44.233
I'm sorry I won't be here
to do that for you.

35:44.233 --> 35:47.133
You're gonna make
a wonderful mother.

35:49.533 --> 35:51.400
What's wrong?

36:01.267 --> 36:04.633
You know what the best part
of our friendship is?

36:07.567 --> 36:10.867
Having you come to me
for advice,

36:10.867 --> 36:12.133
pretending you're not.

36:14.433 --> 36:18.167
That someone
as strong and tough as

36:18.167 --> 36:20.600
Jelena Howard

36:20.600 --> 36:22.700
needs me.

36:29.100 --> 36:32.933
There's a conversation
I need to have with Terrence,

36:32.933 --> 36:36.167
but, um...

36:36.167 --> 36:38.733
I can't seem
to bring myself to do it.

36:40.867 --> 36:44.400
Opening up is
so hard for you.

36:45.600 --> 36:48.167
You feel exposed.

36:48.167 --> 36:49.833
Vulnerable.

36:51.100 --> 36:52.667
But that's okay.

36:53.733 --> 36:56.100
Try.

36:58.200 --> 37:02.367
No, don't just nod
and say you'll do it.

37:03.300 --> 37:05.200
Open up now.

37:05.200 --> 37:06.333
To me.

37:09.267 --> 37:13.067
Whatever you say would
never leave this room.

37:13.067 --> 37:15.733
I couldn't tell anyone.

37:18.200 --> 37:20.800
What's your deepest secret,
Jelena?

37:22.400 --> 37:25.733
What's the one thing
you're afraid to say out loud,

37:25.733 --> 37:27.733
more than anything else?

37:32.700 --> 37:35.700
I'm terrified
of being alone.

37:42.233 --> 37:43.433
I know.

37:56.600 --> 37:58.367
Please.

38:25.833 --> 38:27.967
She's gone.

38:57.967 --> 39:00.433
Come to Daddy.

39:03.933 --> 39:05.367
I meant the chair.

39:07.067 --> 39:09.300
You're gonna come
to want me, Lionel.

39:09.300 --> 39:12.567
We're more alike
than you think.

39:12.567 --> 39:16.233
We love and hate
the same things.

39:16.233 --> 39:18.633
We love revenge,

39:18.633 --> 39:20.667
and we hate
the same person.

39:22.233 --> 39:24.833
I'm about to scratch
both those itches.

39:26.067 --> 39:27.500
Everything I had done

39:27.500 --> 39:29.433
to her all these months...

39:30.600 --> 39:33.067
she was never
in any real danger.

39:35.133 --> 39:36.900
Until now.

39:38.367 --> 39:39.833
What're you gonna do?

39:43.533 --> 39:45.767
I'm gonna kill
Sloane Hayes.

39:57.233 --> 39:58.900
Next time, on the season finale
of "Hit the Floor."

39:58.900 --> 40:00.833
It's an e-mail.
From who?

40:00.833 --> 40:02.100
Raquel.

40:02.100 --> 40:03.200
I love you.

40:03.200 --> 40:05.333
You just don't trust me.

40:05.333 --> 40:07.100
I'm his girlfriend.
Mandy.

40:07.100 --> 40:08.433
Who the hell is Mandy?

40:08.433 --> 40:10.167
Oscar-- the way
he's looking at me,

40:10.167 --> 40:12.133
Pete, I don't know
what he's gonna do.

40:12.133 --> 40:14.000
Payback's a bitch...

40:14.000 --> 40:15.567
bitch.

40:15.567 --> 40:17.167
Here I am.
Do it.

40:17.167 --> 40:18.600
Kill me.

40:23.500 --> 40:25.467
Do I have
your attention now?
