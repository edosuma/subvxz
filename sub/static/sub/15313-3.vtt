WEBVTT

00:02.240 --> 00:03.707
Bring it over here.

00:03.775 --> 00:05.834
Help me get this into a pile.

00:07.179 --> 00:09.511
How? Joderic will be under orders.

00:09.581 --> 00:12.311
"How" is not for you to worry about.

00:12.384 --> 00:14.511
I cannot be seen to take from you.

00:14.587 --> 00:16.350
I cannot even be seen with you. Our Matthew...

00:16.423 --> 00:18.084
Our Matthew has work at the castle.

00:18.191 --> 00:19.659
Owen.

00:19.727 --> 00:23.459
Take your wife and family
and get your belongings back into the mill.

00:24.231 --> 00:26.962
Joderic will not evict you today.

00:28.000 --> 00:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:36.245 --> 00:37.838
Let's go.

00:37.915 --> 00:39.473
Robin says you're gonna be all right.

00:39.550 --> 00:41.677
What are you waiting for?

00:41.752 --> 00:43.812
Nothing.

00:43.888 --> 00:46.516
I explained things to him.
Everything's gonna be all right.

00:46.624 --> 00:49.388
- Oh, please!
- What?

00:49.461 --> 00:54.058
You want to see the look on her face,
don't you? You want to see the gratitude.

01:02.110 --> 01:03.668
Joderic!

01:08.283 --> 01:09.648
Robin...

01:09.718 --> 01:12.517
Do not interfere. You know I have to do this.

01:12.589 --> 01:16.423
And you know there are Sheriff's men
on their way to make sure there 's no trouble.

01:16.493 --> 01:18.085
Do you have to do this?

01:18.161 --> 01:20.357
I did it under the old Sheriff,
you did not complain.

01:20.431 --> 01:22.865
- That was different.
- How?

01:22.933 --> 01:26.267
Two things are certain in life - death and taxes.

01:26.338 --> 01:29.830
But when the death is caused by the taxes,
something is rotten.

01:30.943 --> 01:32.274
Take this.

01:32.345 --> 01:35.406
- The miller' s debt.
- I cannot.

01:35.481 --> 01:37.473
This is stolen money.

01:37.551 --> 01:39.713
The Sheriff knows the miller cannot afford it.

01:44.358 --> 01:47.591
I could break it into small amounts.
Pay it in over time.

01:47.663 --> 01:49.061
That would be credible.

01:49.130 --> 01:53.034
Every time somebody breaks bread
in Nettlestone, they will thank you, Joderic.

01:53.103 --> 01:55.436
- Sure.
- Do me a favor.

01:56.306 --> 01:58.069
Tell them you have not seen me.

01:58.141 --> 02:00.006
Tell them this was your own scheme.

02:00.077 --> 02:03.410
- Why?
- My friends think I am vain!

02:15.261 --> 02:18.493
He's here to evict us.
Robin did not make it right.

02:18.566 --> 02:20.261
- He said he would fix it.
- How?

02:22.570 --> 02:24.698
Let me get this straight.

02:24.773 --> 02:26.934
We're giving money to a tax collector?

02:27.008 --> 02:28.374
A bailiff.

02:28.444 --> 02:30.309
Oh, that makes all the difference.

02:44.362 --> 02:46.296
Owen.

02:46.364 --> 02:47.764
Kate.

02:47.833 --> 02:49.858
As you know, I am here today...

02:49.935 --> 02:53.702
Didn't you see Robin Hood? He said
he'd speak to you so we wouldn't be evicted.

02:53.773 --> 02:57.437
No. No, I'm sorry...

02:57.511 --> 02:59.103
I have not seen Robin Hood.

03:00.615 --> 03:02.447
But we can work this out.

03:10.159 --> 03:12.491
He's killed him. Robin's killed him!

03:58.316 --> 04:00.181
Oi, stop!

04:18.471 --> 04:20.440
Master!

04:23.546 --> 04:26.674
What, you can't believe
someone's better than you?

04:26.749 --> 04:28.876
- He kicked you good.
- Who is he?

04:28.951 --> 04:30.920
The Nightwatchman.

04:30.987 --> 04:35.924
- Well, I've never heard of him.
- The Nightwatchman? Been around for years.

04:35.992 --> 04:37.551
Maybe you were off on a crusade.

04:38.396 --> 04:40.228
He's a good man.

04:40.299 --> 04:42.392
He's talked about in all the villages.

04:42.467 --> 04:46.666
He's been seen in Nottingham.
Even at the castle. Always at night.

04:46.739 --> 04:48.536
Leaves medicine and stuff. Food.

04:49.575 --> 04:53.911
Sheriff's men are ordered to shoot him on sight
but he's never hurt a fly.

04:53.981 --> 04:56.108
Why did he kill Joderic, then?

04:57.651 --> 04:58.584
We need to find him.

05:01.791 --> 05:07.320
The villagers of Nettlestone report
that Robin Hood...

05:07.397 --> 05:10.162
killed an innocent bailiff today.

05:10.234 --> 05:12.429
This is marvelous, isn't it?

05:12.502 --> 05:14.266
What drama!

05:14.338 --> 05:16.898
Because now even his beloved villagers

05:16.974 --> 05:21.106
will lose patience when their heroes
start picking them off.

05:21.179 --> 05:23.705
What else are they saying?

05:23.783 --> 05:27.219
Hood was fulfilling a promise
to prevent an eviction.

05:28.522 --> 05:30.284
War has addled his brain.

05:30.356 --> 05:32.291
I'm not at all surprised.

05:32.359 --> 05:35.055
So, what do you propose we do?

05:36.196 --> 05:38.563
Immediate reprisals against villages.

05:38.632 --> 05:40.397
Joderic would not want that.

05:40.469 --> 05:44.667
Why should more innocent people suffer
because of his death?

05:44.740 --> 05:48.199
The same people who
witnessed and reported the crime.

05:49.478 --> 05:52.847
And did this strategy of reprisals
work in the villages before?

05:53.918 --> 05:55.282
No.

05:56.654 --> 05:58.019
Marian is right.

06:00.358 --> 06:04.159
We will not be going down that road again.
De Fourtnoy - alternatives?

06:05.131 --> 06:08.691
There is a... political advantage to be had here.

06:09.802 --> 06:13.432
Robin Hood has given us the high ground.
We should keep it, my thoughts exactly.

06:13.507 --> 06:16.704
We could have the town criers
announce what's taken place.

06:16.777 --> 06:20.544
Make sure everybody knows that
an innocent was killed.

06:20.615 --> 06:22.446
Good.

06:23.519 --> 06:26.045
We are going to win hearts and minds.

06:28.191 --> 06:29.715
My lord.

06:29.793 --> 06:32.318
I still believe actions rather than words...

06:33.396 --> 06:37.060
If I had the resources I could deal with him,
I could hunt him down...

06:37.134 --> 06:38.465
Very well.

06:38.536 --> 06:41.370
We'll do both and may the best man win.

06:47.413 --> 06:49.381
Joderic was unique.

06:50.383 --> 06:54.151
He was kind, compassionate, learned.

06:55.991 --> 06:57.719
The murder of the bailiff...

06:57.792 --> 07:00.921
We'll leave as soon as Joderic's buried.

07:00.996 --> 07:03.728
We can say you were too upset.

07:03.800 --> 07:05.790
I am too upset.

07:07.704 --> 07:11.333
In response to this change of direction
from Robin Hood...

07:11.408 --> 07:16.108
Joe? What are you doing here?

07:16.180 --> 07:18.172
You cannot work.

07:19.017 --> 07:21.748
They've made everyone come back in.

07:21.820 --> 07:23.720
Called me out of retirement.

07:23.789 --> 07:25.951
I will talk to the Sheriff.

07:26.026 --> 07:28.962
I'll get you off your duties.

07:29.030 --> 07:31.020
Work helps.

07:31.131 --> 07:33.156
... a war on terror! T hese people...

07:33.233 --> 07:35.963
I still reach out for her in the night,
I know it's daft...

07:36.037 --> 07:37.971
It is not daft.

07:38.039 --> 07:40.804
When all this is over
you are coming home with us.

07:40.876 --> 07:43.777
... of our humanity and of our innocence.

07:46.648 --> 07:50.086
All this is gone in one moment,

07:50.154 --> 07:54.614
with one arrow fired from the bow

07:54.692 --> 07:55.853
of Robin Hood.

07:55.927 --> 07:58.691
- He is saying you killed Joderic!
- Of course he is.

07:58.764 --> 08:01.392
Yes, but he's making us look like criminals!

08:01.467 --> 08:03.229
- You know we are criminals.
- What?

08:03.301 --> 08:06.032
Are we suddenly something else?

08:06.105 --> 08:10.873
...between stability, order, authority...

08:11.980 --> 08:17.077
or the random, chaotic cruelty of Robin Hood
and all outlaws like him.

08:17.151 --> 08:21.020
This cowardly crime, this murder,
will be punished.

08:21.090 --> 08:25.288
We will hunt Hood down, with dogs if necessary,

08:25.361 --> 08:27.853
and we will ensure that he does not succeed,

08:27.931 --> 08:31.390
We will not be cowed, this is what he wants...

08:31.469 --> 08:33.494
You never shoot me, understand?

08:38.744 --> 08:41.405
This, this is all in my honor, isn't it?

08:41.480 --> 08:44.005
You really do think everything
is about you, don't you?

08:44.082 --> 08:47.575
- Only when it is about me!
- You have given him a stick to beat you with.

08:47.654 --> 08:50.818
You killed an innocent clerk
and now here he is making the most of it.

08:50.891 --> 08:52.860
I did not do it.

08:52.927 --> 08:54.292
I'm sure.

08:54.361 --> 08:57.195
It was the so-called non-violent
Nightwatchman.

08:57.264 --> 08:59.962
- No!
- I saw him. I was there.

09:00.036 --> 09:01.628
It was not the Nightwatchman.

09:01.704 --> 09:03.068
- How do you know?
- I know.

09:03.138 --> 09:06.165
- Then why did he run?
- Why did you run from Joderic?

09:09.280 --> 09:11.714
I should go.

09:11.782 --> 09:13.512
- You must help me.
- I am helping you.

09:13.584 --> 09:15.108
It was not the Nightwatchman.

09:15.186 --> 09:16.710
Whoever it is.

09:16.788 --> 09:20.317
I will find him and I can look
everywhere apart from one place.

09:21.394 --> 09:24.590
- I need you to look in the castle.
- I need you to not tell me what to do.

09:24.663 --> 09:27.132
Please! I must clear my name.

09:27.201 --> 09:30.601
What about catching the killer?
Isn't that more important than your name?

09:30.670 --> 09:33.333
If people do not trust me,
then what good can I do?

09:36.143 --> 09:38.112
I'll try.

09:42.218 --> 09:46.917
Tell me, De Fourtnoy. Is Master at Arms
just a ceremonial position now?

09:46.989 --> 09:52.087
Because problems like Hood
demand real solutions.

09:52.162 --> 09:53.528
Town criers?

09:59.370 --> 10:01.339
Sir Guy.

10:01.407 --> 10:03.341
Marian.

10:03.409 --> 10:04.877
All these dogs for one man?

10:04.945 --> 10:08.039
Yeah, it was my idea.

10:08.115 --> 10:10.516
The Master at Arms
would have us doing nothing.

10:10.585 --> 10:12.679
You are in competition?

10:12.755 --> 10:16.884
He's a little man, promoted too far.
Anyone would make a better Master at Arms.

10:16.958 --> 10:20.327
Politics. Even when my father was the Sheriff,

10:20.396 --> 10:23.126
I could not grasp the intricacies.

10:23.199 --> 10:24.563
He sent me here, by the way.

10:24.634 --> 10:27.501
He thinks it is safer,
with a killer on the loose.

10:27.570 --> 10:29.971
You say "a killer"? You do not think it is Hood?

10:31.308 --> 10:34.574
Whoever it is, he thought it would be safer
here in the castle.

10:36.113 --> 10:37.479
No, that's not permitted.

10:38.650 --> 10:40.015
Oh.

10:43.623 --> 10:45.057
I'll talk to the Sheriff.

10:47.026 --> 10:48.790
Thank you, Sir Guy.

10:51.232 --> 10:53.757
Right. I want a line sweeping
south through the forest.

10:53.835 --> 10:56.463
Let's show De Fourtnoy how to
hunt down Robin Hood.

10:56.538 --> 10:59.133
With these dogs, he will run.

11:06.651 --> 11:08.208
This I do not like.

11:14.058 --> 11:17.427
The King's Guild of Hunters and Foresters.
Coming this way.

11:18.197 --> 11:19.289
Dogs!

11:28.209 --> 11:31.406
Pairs. Meet where we stored the provisions.

11:44.729 --> 11:46.991
Faster!

12:13.227 --> 12:14.662
Matthew, am I left-handed?

12:16.531 --> 12:18.123
A clue...

12:19.201 --> 12:20.260
No!

12:20.336 --> 12:22.497
Sorry, sir.

12:32.651 --> 12:33.880
Stand on one leg.

12:36.822 --> 12:39.119
The right one.

12:39.826 --> 12:41.520
One hour.

12:41.594 --> 12:44.290
That might help you to remember, hm?

12:46.733 --> 12:48.099
So...

12:49.237 --> 12:51.205
New boy, how're you finding your new job? Hm?

12:54.343 --> 12:57.471
Oh, don't worry.
You know, you're a lucky boy.

12:57.545 --> 13:03.110
Now your daddy's mill is shut, you could be
running through the forest chased by hounds...

13:05.822 --> 13:07.518
Guards! Guards!

13:08.826 --> 13:10.191
Raise the alarm!

13:14.065 --> 13:16.864
In my own room? In my own room?
Where are the men?

13:16.935 --> 13:20.338
Gisborne has taken them
to hunt Hood with the dogs.

13:20.407 --> 13:21.533
Gisborne is a fool.

13:21.608 --> 13:24.168
Evidently, Hood has evaded him.

13:24.244 --> 13:25.734
This is nothing to do with Robin Hood.

13:25.813 --> 13:29.476
Now, you lock down this castle. Tell Gisborne
to scrap the dogs and find the killer!

13:29.550 --> 13:30.676
Yes, my lord.

13:35.390 --> 13:36.483
Stop!

13:37.660 --> 13:40.151
Now, you tell Gisborne to double the dogs.

13:40.229 --> 13:42.357
My lord, I thought you said
it could not be Hood.

13:42.432 --> 13:43.797
Two words - mud sticks.

13:43.867 --> 13:47.565
Hood's been blamed for one death,
let's blame him for two.

13:47.638 --> 13:50.767
Meanwhile, you find out
who's really responsible for this.

13:50.842 --> 13:51.809
Yes, my lord.

14:26.884 --> 14:31.220
We pray for Matthew's soul
as he journeys to a better place.

14:33.091 --> 14:34.457
Watch over us, Matthew,

14:35.094 --> 14:37.120
and be proud.

14:37.897 --> 14:40.594
We will bring Robin Hood to justice.

14:41.701 --> 14:43.692
You have my word.

14:55.518 --> 14:57.247
I don't believe it!

14:57.320 --> 14:59.447
- The soldiers found it.
- No!

15:00.622 --> 15:02.557
That was our...

15:02.625 --> 15:04.992
- That was our store.
- They destroyed everything.

15:05.062 --> 15:06.928
That was our food!

15:19.378 --> 15:20.710
What is going on?

15:20.781 --> 15:22.510
I am hiding in my own castle.

15:22.583 --> 15:25.814
I cannot move in my own castle.
Get out! Get out!

15:25.887 --> 15:30.085
We will not leave a stone unturned, my lord.
The killer will be found.

15:30.158 --> 15:33.287
You will not leave a stone unturned,
he will be found, la-di-da-di-da...

15:33.362 --> 15:34.795
Get on with it, then!

15:46.844 --> 15:49.506
How is Gisborne doing with Locksley?

15:49.580 --> 15:53.312
More dogs have been brought in
but the outlaw is still on the run.

15:55.053 --> 15:57.352
Have you put it about that he's
killed at least twice?

15:57.423 --> 15:59.857
- Yes, my lord.
- Good.

15:59.926 --> 16:02.395
Do you think...

16:02.463 --> 16:05.796
two deaths are enough? Hm?

16:05.866 --> 16:08.426
To get them to really turn against him,
the rebel?

16:09.871 --> 16:12.568
If we're going to blame Hood,
let's do it properly.

16:12.642 --> 16:14.007
What do you think?

16:14.076 --> 16:15.805
Hm?

16:15.878 --> 16:19.006
I think maybe a few more deaths.
It'd be interesting.

16:19.081 --> 16:22.347
You know, pretty deaths, not just boys,
but pretty deaths.

16:38.104 --> 16:39.594
Guards!

16:39.673 --> 16:41.641
Quickly, the cloisters.

16:49.283 --> 16:51.445
Lady Marian, come away, if you please.

16:51.520 --> 16:54.513
How could this happen?
I thought you had the castle locked down.

16:54.591 --> 16:56.855
You must go back to your room,
it is not safe here.

17:10.675 --> 17:14.441
What is going on here?
Three people have been killed under your nose.

17:14.512 --> 17:17.415
- Well, that is unfortunate.
- It's incompetent!

17:17.483 --> 17:20.385
What have you achieved?
You found the remnants of a picnic,

17:20.454 --> 17:23.788
- but Robin Hood, no!
- At least I found something, unlike you!

17:23.858 --> 17:27.191
Shut up! Couple of women!

17:27.262 --> 17:29.356
Grow up!

17:33.469 --> 17:36.405
Forgive me, all these killings...

17:36.474 --> 17:39.807
They are attributed to Robin Hood
but what proof is there?

17:39.877 --> 17:43.438
There were no witnesses.
How could he have moved about the castle

17:43.514 --> 17:45.277
unchallenged by your guards?

17:45.349 --> 17:49.081
And you yourself must have been there
moments before the maid was killed?

17:49.888 --> 17:51.617
That I cannot recall.

17:51.690 --> 17:54.421
And from one point of view,
the killings have been useful, no?

17:54.494 --> 17:56.485
Given you the chance to shine?

18:05.273 --> 18:06.638
Did she see you?

18:06.708 --> 18:09.074
She's guessing, my lord. She's a girl.

18:36.544 --> 18:38.704
Do you think Will will bring some water?

18:40.547 --> 18:43.642
A bit of bread wouldn't go amiss.
Perhaps some cheese.

18:45.954 --> 18:51.119
We're going to be captured,
tortured and hanged...

18:51.961 --> 18:53.895
and he wants cheese?

18:57.100 --> 18:59.160
Ohh... Don't they ever give up?

19:07.546 --> 19:09.275
Master, the dogs.

19:10.316 --> 19:14.344
- We cannot stay. There 's too many of them.
- Well, we must do something.

19:15.322 --> 19:17.620
We are running away
when we should be in pursuit.

19:18.325 --> 19:20.317
The Nightwatchman is still out there.

19:33.743 --> 19:35.301
We head east.

19:35.378 --> 19:37.074
Back to Nettlestone.

19:46.892 --> 19:49.383
Get out of our village,
you're not welcome.

19:51.864 --> 19:53.229
Hello.

19:53.299 --> 19:56.428
Excuse me. Do you know if the Nightwatchman
has been back here again?

19:57.571 --> 19:59.505
Has the Nightwatchman been back at all?

19:59.573 --> 20:02.634
Do you have any food?
Any water? Anything. We are weary.

20:02.710 --> 20:05.873
- You'll hang for what you've done!
- You killed my son!

20:05.947 --> 20:08.006
What? Matthew's dead?

20:09.718 --> 20:11.879
- You deny it?
- Yes!

20:12.655 --> 20:14.555
- Kate, you know me!
- And Joderic.

20:14.623 --> 20:18.117
You told me you'd see to him.
If I'd known you would kill him...

20:18.196 --> 20:21.427
Owen, I swear, I could never hurt Matthew.

20:21.499 --> 20:23.593
Matthew? Don't you say his name.

20:23.669 --> 20:25.499
Don't you put his name in your mouth.

20:25.571 --> 20:27.300
I swear, I never killed Matthew.

20:27.372 --> 20:30.603
- I didn't kill Joderic.
- No, and you didn't kill those others either?

20:30.676 --> 20:32.338
What others?

20:33.111 --> 20:36.844
I hope they draw your guts out and quarter you.

20:36.917 --> 20:39.182
We didn't do it! We didn't do any of it!

20:39.254 --> 20:40.880
Hold them for the Sheriff!

20:42.090 --> 20:43.455
Enough!

20:43.557 --> 20:46.493
You don't understand!
I'm fighting for you!

20:48.130 --> 20:51.463
The Sheriff hangs people for stealing bread.

20:51.534 --> 20:53.331
He cuts out their tongues!

20:54.838 --> 20:56.203
He divides us...

20:58.140 --> 21:00.906
We're going! Let's get out of here!

21:04.283 --> 21:06.911
- Let me through, let me through!
- Stay back!

21:10.524 --> 21:11.888
Stay there!

21:13.360 --> 21:15.692
Leave 'em be, you son of a cur!

21:24.039 --> 21:25.369
I walked away from my home.

21:27.109 --> 21:28.475
For them!

21:28.545 --> 21:30.775
I gave myself up to the Sheriff for them!

21:30.847 --> 21:32.872
We gave Joderic money for them.

21:32.949 --> 21:35.042
I never really did understand that.

21:39.757 --> 21:41.122
It's the tag.

21:43.094 --> 21:45.654
Irefined it. You can't copy it now.

21:45.730 --> 21:48.928
It's only me and my dad know how
to do edges like that.

21:49.001 --> 21:50.970
It's good.

21:51.704 --> 21:53.673
It's good.

22:00.147 --> 22:02.343
Sorry, my lady, you can't come through here.

22:02.417 --> 22:04.443
I've come to see Sergeant Lacey.

22:04.520 --> 22:05.884
I'll deal with this.

22:09.526 --> 22:11.891
You shouldn't be here, Marian. It's not safe.

22:11.962 --> 22:13.896
I know, thank you.

22:13.964 --> 22:15.489
It's all right.

22:15.565 --> 22:17.363
It's not though, is it?

22:21.073 --> 22:22.437
No.

22:23.108 --> 22:26.339
Who'd have thought? Robin a killer.

22:28.348 --> 22:30.475
All these people dead.

22:30.550 --> 22:32.541
I can't understand.

22:33.754 --> 22:35.745
Matthew...

22:36.390 --> 22:37.756
His poor mum and dad...

22:37.825 --> 22:39.850
I know how they feel.

22:41.463 --> 22:43.624
It was the same with Ruth.

22:45.734 --> 22:47.726
You try not to dwell on it.

22:49.138 --> 22:50.663
Remember the good times.

22:53.944 --> 22:57.813
The only thing I regret is that
she didn't die in her own bed.

22:58.883 --> 23:00.646
That I cannot...

23:24.980 --> 23:27.312
John!

23:27.382 --> 23:29.908
I need you to take over.

23:29.986 --> 23:31.454
I have to go to the castle.

23:31.522 --> 23:34.082
Enough is enough. We stop running, now!

23:34.158 --> 23:36.991
- You're not gonna give yourself in again?
- Not this time.

23:37.061 --> 23:40.054
- I've got some ideas for how you could get in.
- Go on.

23:40.131 --> 23:41.791
Do you want clever or really clever?

23:41.865 --> 23:43.026
I want fast.

23:44.335 --> 23:48.296
From here, could I shoot an arrow
through that window?

23:50.343 --> 23:52.742
Pull smoothly like you're combing your hair.

24:02.323 --> 24:03.883
You could.

24:04.961 --> 24:06.826
But of course I wouldn't.

24:10.567 --> 24:13.035
You're teasing me, aren't you?

24:18.976 --> 24:21.070
Yeah, I'll say anything, I will.

24:22.380 --> 24:24.644
I'm from the days when you could.

24:24.716 --> 24:26.912
Nowadays, we hold our tongues,

24:26.986 --> 24:29.318
those of us lucky enough to still have them.

24:30.356 --> 24:32.518
We say one thing when we mean another.

24:34.963 --> 24:36.692
For instance...

24:37.766 --> 24:43.262
Well, you say you want archery lessons
but you're really only interested in bow range.

24:48.778 --> 24:51.907
You're trying to prove it couldn't be him.

24:51.982 --> 24:54.542
- You still love him?
- No.

24:57.922 --> 24:58.981
Who?

25:01.794 --> 25:03.820
Tell him.

25:03.897 --> 25:05.990
Not that you ever see him, but tell him.

25:07.600 --> 25:09.535
Good people do still love him.

26:25.324 --> 26:27.849
Why can it never be a beautiful woman?

26:29.630 --> 26:30.858
Call off your dogs.

26:30.931 --> 26:33.297
Why? You're a mad killer.

26:33.367 --> 26:35.063
You know I'm not.

26:36.004 --> 26:37.369
It's true.

26:39.173 --> 26:40.937
So, now we've got that sorted,

26:41.009 --> 26:43.535
what do you want to do, slit the other wrist?

26:43.612 --> 26:45.808
It seems to me that somebody
wants you dead.

26:45.881 --> 26:49.875
Well, what's new? Welcome to my world.

26:51.188 --> 26:53.521
I came into your room unseen.

26:54.592 --> 26:58.495
If the killer is half as good as me,
he will do the same.

27:00.364 --> 27:02.197
And your point is...?

27:02.268 --> 27:03.895
I can catch him for you.

27:08.508 --> 27:09.669
Mm.

27:10.411 --> 27:12.311
Two questions.

27:13.614 --> 27:15.344
How?

27:16.418 --> 27:18.249
And why?

27:18.320 --> 27:20.516
Ride through Nettlestone Village.

27:20.589 --> 27:24.458
Parade yourself.
Make sure everybody knows you're there.

27:25.528 --> 27:28.987
That will draw out the killer
and my men will shoot him.

27:29.066 --> 27:31.695
- What about my men?
- Because mine are invisible.

27:33.570 --> 27:35.300
Supposing...

27:36.373 --> 27:38.342
I agree.

27:40.279 --> 27:41.644
Why?

27:44.583 --> 27:46.949
Innocent people are being killed.

27:48.389 --> 27:50.380
I cannot allow that.

27:52.994 --> 27:55.360
Oh, come on, Robin.

27:57.499 --> 28:00.333
This is pillow talk, isn't it? Hm?

28:01.604 --> 28:04.539
Oh, come on, you can be honest with me.

28:04.607 --> 28:06.735
That's not the real reason, is it?

28:06.810 --> 28:09.745
Do you want to know what the real reason is?

28:10.814 --> 28:12.476
Nobody loves you any more.

28:12.550 --> 28:14.951
Hm?

28:15.020 --> 28:17.649
They've turned against you.
The common serfs.

28:19.991 --> 28:23.258
And really, those are the people
that love you the most.

28:23.330 --> 28:25.388
That's what you can't allow to happen.

28:25.465 --> 28:27.625
Do we have an agreement?

28:27.700 --> 28:29.726
Oh, have I touched a sore point?

28:29.803 --> 28:31.669
I'll take that as a yes.

28:32.807 --> 28:35.299
And by the way, this...

28:35.376 --> 28:37.538
is for you.

28:37.613 --> 28:39.604
For future reference.

28:40.215 --> 28:42.241
Anybody wearing one of those...

28:42.318 --> 28:44.342
is with me.

28:45.522 --> 28:47.046
Sweet!

28:47.123 --> 28:48.489
Robin...

28:48.559 --> 28:49.923
Does it go with my dress?

28:52.762 --> 28:55.528
This is my fee for saving your life.

28:55.601 --> 28:57.158
Hm?

29:23.467 --> 29:25.024
I'm sorry, my lady.

29:27.237 --> 29:30.002
So, this is you with your hair down?

29:31.210 --> 29:33.200
- You cannot be here.
- Shh!

29:36.048 --> 29:38.448
Do not be such a spoilsport, Marian.

29:43.089 --> 29:45.923
I've been trying to think about
who could've done this.

29:45.993 --> 29:48.757
I think the killer is De Fourtnoy,
the Master at Arms.

29:48.829 --> 29:50.022
Because?

29:50.096 --> 29:52.657
He was right there when the maid was killed.

29:52.734 --> 29:56.192
And a murderer on the loose
merely consolidates his position.

29:56.271 --> 30:00.708
- This situation is in his interests.
- Well, I intend to change this situation.

30:00.775 --> 30:03.370
You think just because you want
to change things, you can.

30:03.446 --> 30:06.280
It's hard to change the things
you do not want to change.

30:06.350 --> 30:10.720
- What about just getting away while you can?
- Why? When we're having so much fun?

30:10.788 --> 30:14.383
- Oh, does anything touch you, Robin?
- What does that mean?

30:14.492 --> 30:19.624
It means you wander around as if nothing could
hurt you, as if arrows would bounce off you.

30:19.698 --> 30:22.326
I do not think I have ever seen you hurt.

30:22.401 --> 30:23.869
Oh, I have been hurt.

30:23.937 --> 30:25.302
Tell me.

30:26.973 --> 30:29.101
Hm? See?

30:30.211 --> 30:32.941
You think it is strong not to feel.

30:33.014 --> 30:37.509
But if you cannot admit you feel,
how can you understand when others feel?

30:37.586 --> 30:41.956
- How can you be a whole man?
- I feel when innocent people are shot down.

30:42.026 --> 30:44.323
I feel when my men are hunted like animals.

30:44.394 --> 30:46.795
I feel when good people turn against me.

30:49.033 --> 30:51.332
I was talking about you to someone today.

30:52.036 --> 30:53.561
A good man.

30:53.638 --> 30:57.370
Someone who still remembers you
from the old days.

30:59.445 --> 31:02.972
And, you know,
there are still people who love you.

31:04.851 --> 31:06.375
- My lady!
- One moment...

31:06.452 --> 31:08.444
- I must search your room.
- Go! Out!

31:09.924 --> 31:13.053
By the way, your investigations...

31:13.128 --> 31:15.096
Good work!

31:16.065 --> 31:17.829
Let's see if you're right tomorrow.

31:19.535 --> 31:21.401
- Shh.
- My lady!

31:22.171 --> 31:24.697
You got the Sheriff to call off the dogs?

31:24.775 --> 31:27.140
How?

31:27.211 --> 31:28.577
Pillow talk.

31:28.647 --> 31:30.614
Have you been in bed with the Sheriff?

31:30.680 --> 31:32.172
I brokered a deal.

31:33.452 --> 31:36.580
We do not deal with the Sheriff.

31:37.656 --> 31:39.089
Tomorrow...

31:39.158 --> 31:40.557
we save his life.

31:40.627 --> 31:41.993
What?

31:42.062 --> 31:46.021
Can we argue about that tomorrow?
Today, if there are no dogs...

31:46.133 --> 31:47.533
I would like to sleep.

31:47.602 --> 31:49.968
- No, I have a better idea.
- Another one?

31:50.038 --> 31:52.906
If it's as good as saving the Sheriff's life,
I'm with cheese boy.

31:52.974 --> 31:55.272
Did they find the food we stored
at the long stone?

31:57.946 --> 32:00.973
If we were killers,
would we bring them food?

32:01.050 --> 32:04.249
- It proves we are not killers.
- But they hate us.

32:06.056 --> 32:09.185
Now the mill is closed,
the village will be suffering.

32:09.261 --> 32:11.251
They will be hungry.

32:12.397 --> 32:16.198
- You just want everyone to love you.
- I do not want to be branded a killer.

32:16.268 --> 32:18.635
- It is different.
- You want to be loved!

32:19.705 --> 32:22.834
And I tell you something, it's not fair.

32:22.910 --> 32:25.434
I love you and no one gives me any food.

32:25.512 --> 32:28.745
- Yet people who do not love you are fed.
- Ah! Come on!

32:28.816 --> 32:30.374
The world is wrong.

32:30.451 --> 32:35.185
We are feeding people who do not love us
and saving a man who wants us dead.

32:35.257 --> 32:37.351
I've changed my mind.

32:37.427 --> 32:40.192
I no longer love you. Now can I eat?

33:23.214 --> 33:24.704
I am no killer.

33:27.218 --> 33:30.813
I bring food to show my goodwill.

33:33.724 --> 33:35.091
I am your friend.

33:37.363 --> 33:39.992
My men are tired and hungry.

33:44.370 --> 33:46.305
This is the last of our food.

33:54.450 --> 33:56.179
Owen...

33:56.853 --> 33:58.979
You are using us.

33:59.055 --> 34:01.216
You and the Sheriff.

34:01.291 --> 34:02.849
I am not.

34:02.926 --> 34:07.091
Fighting your own personal battle,
using us as pawns.

34:07.165 --> 34:08.792
What gifts will he bring later?

34:11.835 --> 34:16.364
Fellow Englishmen,
your Sheriff and I bring you a gift.

34:16.442 --> 34:21.176
That gift is a reminder that we are free
and we should walk free.

34:22.849 --> 34:26.650
Today, your Sheriff and I show no fear.

34:27.655 --> 34:29.487
Today, we defy Robin Hood.

34:30.458 --> 34:34.226
Today, we walk among you
to show that life goes on.

34:34.297 --> 34:39.030
We will not hide or cower
in the face of outlaws.

34:40.636 --> 34:44.870
We will not change our lives
to suit their campaigns of terror.

34:46.476 --> 34:50.472
We hold our heads high.
Laws exist to protect us.

34:51.684 --> 34:57.749
If we allow Robin Hood to flout these laws and
support him when he undermines basic justice,

34:58.826 --> 35:01.454
then where will he stop?

35:03.096 --> 35:06.534
We give him the right to ignore
another law, and another,

35:06.602 --> 35:09.400
finally to condone the taking of a human life.

35:10.239 --> 35:13.437
For that too is a law made to protect us.

35:13.509 --> 35:17.810
Your Sheriff and I share your horror
at the murder of innocents.

35:17.881 --> 35:20.544
And we stand here today to show...

35:48.350 --> 35:50.375
What do you think you're doing?

35:50.452 --> 35:52.578
You're killing innocent people.

35:52.655 --> 35:54.646
What kind of a man are you?

35:59.262 --> 36:00.991
Marian!

36:04.268 --> 36:06.567
- You're the Nightwatchman?
- There 's no time for this.

36:06.638 --> 36:08.299
I know who's trying to kill the Sheriff.

36:08.373 --> 36:11.604
- It's Joe.
- Joe Lacey?

36:14.046 --> 36:15.413
Joe!

36:19.786 --> 36:22.153
Put it down.

36:22.222 --> 36:24.315
Put the bow down, Joe.

36:26.828 --> 36:28.192
You let me do this, Robin.

36:28.262 --> 36:30.424
Why did you kill them, Joe?

36:31.667 --> 36:33.133
My Ruth.

36:34.270 --> 36:37.001
She worked all her life in the castle.

36:37.873 --> 36:41.401
When she lay dying, where was the Sheriff?

36:41.478 --> 36:43.572
Did he come and visit? Did he send food?

36:44.882 --> 36:46.407
No.

36:46.485 --> 36:49.612
He sent Joderic
because we hadn't paid our taxes.

36:49.687 --> 36:53.181
He put us out
and she died like a dog on the street.

36:53.259 --> 36:55.090
And now, so will he.

36:55.161 --> 36:58.393
You kill that Sheriff,
Prince John will send another one.

36:58.466 --> 37:01.697
And the people of that village will be tortured
because the Sheriff died there.

37:01.769 --> 37:03.760
It's just me, then.

37:04.905 --> 37:09.001
Am I the only man in Nottingham
who can say what he likes? Do what he likes?

37:09.076 --> 37:10.874
Matthew, the miller' s boy?

37:10.946 --> 37:13.313
That was an accident. The Sheriff moved.

37:13.383 --> 37:16.580
And the Sheriff moved the next day
when you killed three more?

37:16.653 --> 37:18.178
Stable boys and washerwomen?

37:20.557 --> 37:23.959
The Sheriff's leaving.
Let me do this terrible thing, Robin.

37:24.029 --> 37:25.325
No.

37:27.999 --> 37:29.398
Put it down.

37:29.468 --> 37:31.766
Joe, put it down.

37:32.838 --> 37:34.807
I will shoot you.

37:54.631 --> 37:56.031
I did it, Ruth.

37:57.367 --> 37:59.359
I shot the Sheriff.

38:02.073 --> 38:03.438
No!

38:04.476 --> 38:06.102
You shot the Deputy.

38:06.679 --> 38:08.942
My lookalike.

38:27.368 --> 38:28.996
Poor Joe.

38:30.072 --> 38:33.564
I understand his grief.
But why did he kill so many?

38:35.278 --> 38:36.678
He didn't.

38:37.882 --> 38:40.646
- Who did?
- Let's go.

39:01.175 --> 39:03.007
What now, Locksley? Hm?

39:03.078 --> 39:05.808
"Oh, I will kill you, I mean it.

39:05.881 --> 39:07.611
"I mean it."

39:07.683 --> 39:11.015
Lacey had no reason to kill stable boys
and washerwomen.

39:11.087 --> 39:13.021
But you did.

39:13.089 --> 39:16.491
It suited you to have people think
I was the killer.

39:17.327 --> 39:19.352
Interesting idea. I wish I'd thought of it.

39:19.430 --> 39:21.022
You did.

39:21.099 --> 39:22.656
Admit it.

39:22.733 --> 39:27.832
How could I admit it? You swore that
you'd kill me if I ever did such a thing.

39:29.608 --> 39:30.973
I meant it.

39:33.312 --> 39:35.009
And that's why...

39:35.081 --> 39:37.208
no one will ever know.

39:56.740 --> 39:59.573
- My lord, let me send my men after him.
- No, too late for that.

39:59.643 --> 40:01.908
But I do have another job for you.

40:09.087 --> 40:10.453
Oh, Gisborne, it's you.

40:11.757 --> 40:12.951
Excuse me.

40:15.128 --> 40:19.589
I just came to inform you that
I'm to be the new Master at Arms.

40:22.938 --> 40:25.236
I don't believe you.

40:25.307 --> 40:29.210
I'd need to hear that from the Sheriff himself.

40:29.279 --> 40:31.747
That will not be possible, I'm afraid.

40:34.718 --> 40:37.483
I have been a loyal servant.

40:38.956 --> 40:41.720
- I have...
- What?

40:44.329 --> 40:45.763
I've even killed for him.

40:47.332 --> 40:50.599
Yeah, the Sheriff thought you might say that.

40:50.670 --> 40:52.069
Which is why...

40:52.839 --> 40:54.568
I am to be the new Master at Arms.

41:13.963 --> 41:16.091
Can I ask you a question?

41:16.166 --> 41:20.102
Why do they call you the Nightwatchman
when you come out in the day?

41:20.170 --> 41:23.903
I don't normally. You know I can't be seen.

41:23.976 --> 41:25.910
And I did not choose the name.

41:25.978 --> 41:27.502
Anyway.

41:27.579 --> 41:29.912
You do not need to do it any more.

41:29.983 --> 41:31.507
Day or night.

41:31.584 --> 41:33.108
Now you're here, you mean?

41:33.186 --> 41:35.178
Yes.

41:35.790 --> 41:38.315
My father had me taught to fight.

41:38.392 --> 41:41.122
He wanted me to have choices in the world.

41:41.195 --> 41:43.925
And I choose to help the poor.

41:43.998 --> 41:46.491
You are not about to stop me doing that.

41:46.569 --> 41:49.663
But does your father know what you're doing?

41:49.738 --> 41:52.037
He thinks I enjoy embroidery.

41:56.580 --> 41:57.979
Give me a moment?

41:58.048 --> 42:00.448
I have a mill to open.

42:32.522 --> 42:33.854
Take this.

42:35.893 --> 42:39.728
It's for you and Owen.
In memory of your son.

42:49.475 --> 42:51.239
John?

43:10.700 --> 43:12.669
I hereby declare this mill...

43:12.737 --> 43:15.103
open for business.

43:26.086 --> 43:28.019
He has to have the glory, doesn't he?

43:29.255 --> 43:30.586
Glory?

43:31.759 --> 43:33.726
No.

43:34.462 --> 43:36.191
I think he just wants to be loved.

43:40.669 --> 43:43.036
Thank you, all of you. All of you.
