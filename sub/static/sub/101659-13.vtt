We're going to have a baby.

11:33.660 --> 11:35.963
We should feel
very happy right now,

11:38.031 --> 11:40.868

to breathe on them.

11:41.001 --> 11:42.135

an expandable

the problem, Shaun.

11:59.987 --> 12:03.323
You're in a relationship
with three people now.

12:03.456 --> 12:05.158

make some adjustments.

12:11.264 --> 12:13.133
Okay.

12:13.266 --> 12:15.535
We could use
high-density polyethylene

12:15.668 --> 12:18.806

to do for him what
he never did for you.

12:53.073 --> 12:54.307
No, he did
take care of me.

12:54.441 --> 12:55.242
He just quit.

12:57.710 --> 12:59.512
He used to pick me up
every day after school.

13:03.884 --> 13:07.220
And then, one day,
he just stopped showing up.

13:09.622 --> 13:12.625
And for years after,
I would come home,

13:12.759 --> 13:16.229
I'd make sure the curtains
were open, and I'd wait.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.632
If a car slowed down
in front of the house,

13:19.766 --> 13:22.602
I'd imagine it was him
coming to grab me up
and rescue me,

13:22.735 --> 13:25.472
and I thought
if I wanted it enough,
he'd come back.

13:25.605 --> 13:28.241
So I just... I just had to
want it more, you know?

13:31.979 --> 13:34.681
And finally, I gave up.
I stopped looking
out the window.

13:39.519 --> 13:42.255

my father a long time ago,

13:42.389 --> 13:45.993
I'm not interested
in getting to know him

13:46.126 --> 13:47.827
just to grieve him
all over again.

13:52.632 --> 13:55.468
But he's still your father,
and you're still you.

13:59.639 --> 14:01.674

if you turn your back on him.

full flexibility

that rancid coffee.

16:59.119 --> 17:00.787
It was coffee.

17:00.920 --> 17:03.423
Plain coffee
with one cream
and one sugar,

17:03.556 --> 17:05.258

She presented with
a retroperitoneal bleed

26:40.499 --> 26:41.433

26:41.567 --> 26:43.002
a total femur replacement.

It is a very risky surgery.

26:51.911 --> 26:53.746

make you feel better
to talk to him?

No.

fully formed genitals.

your appointment later.

27:18.204 --> 27:19.571
I don't think
you should come.

27:24.376 --> 27:27.079
There's a chance
it's too early
to hear a heartbeat,

27:27.213 --> 27:29.081
which will make me
feel sad and scared.

27:30.917 --> 27:33.319
And if I can hear it,
I will feel happy.

27:35.387 --> 27:39.491
And either way, you will
probably feel nothing.

27:41.560 --> 27:45.064
And that'll make me feel
more alone than I already do,

27:45.197 --> 27:47.666

just not come.

41:09.300 --> 41:10.068
Are you ready?

41:11.136 --> 41:11.937
Mm-hmm.

41:15.607 --> 41:16.808
You came.

41:18.243 --> 41:19.244
Hello.

41:19.377 --> 41:22.113
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

41:22.247 --> 41:23.148
I'm the dad.

41:24.583 --> 41:26.652
Nice to meet you, Dad.

41:26.785 --> 41:29.054
We just got started.

41:29.187 --> 41:31.923
Where did you go
to medical school?
Shaun.

41:32.057 --> 41:33.291
Her diploma
is not on the wall.

41:33.424 --> 41:34.626
I would like to know.

41:34.760 --> 41:36.862
Just be the dad.

41:36.995 --> 41:38.496
Sit there, be quiet,
do nothing.

41:41.332 --> 41:42.968
(HEARTBEAT)

41:46.772 --> 41:48.707
Is that the...

41:48.840 --> 41:50.475
OBGYN: That's the heartbeat.

41:50.609 --> 41:51.843
Right there.

41:55.714 --> 41:57.649
We're having a baby.

41:58.383 --> 42:00.351
****

42:06.057 --> 42:07.626
We're having a baby.

42:15.634 --> 42:17.502
(LAUGHS)

42:17.636 --> 42:19.971
****

42:31.850 --> 42:33.619
