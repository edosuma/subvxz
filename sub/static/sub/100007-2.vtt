WEBVTT

00:03.570 --> 00:05.405
JEREMY: Coming up the creek.

00:05.405 --> 00:07.207
GORDON: Right.

00:07.207 --> 00:09.576
JEREMY: And they will travel
up that waterfall here, and
they'll travel in thousands.

00:09.576 --> 00:12.880
GORDON: Up the waterfall?
JEREMY: Up the waterfall.

00:13.480 --> 00:15.415
GORDON: They have teeth?
JEREMY: They have teeth.

00:15.415 --> 00:17.985
GORDON: Do they bite?
JEREMY: They bite!

00:19.520 --> 00:22.155
Just here, just here. (bleep)!

00:22.155 --> 00:24.091
Don't let them get away.

00:24.091 --> 00:27.995
Both hands. Yes, boy!
Get him! (bleep).

00:34.801 --> 00:38.839
GORDON: I'm in New Zealand
on a mission to unlock

00:38.839 --> 00:44.978
one of the world's best kept
food secrets, Maori cuisine.

00:46.346 --> 00:51.485
I feel like I'm at the end
of the Earth, because the
next stop is Antarctica.

00:56.256 --> 01:00.294
What I know about the food of
this isolated country could be
written on a grain of rice.

01:00.894 --> 01:07.234
So, I'm starting on the remote
and wild Stewart Island, known
by the Maori as Rakiura.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.270
I'm here to meet Monique Fiso.

01:10.270 --> 01:13.607
Now she's a super talented
up and coming Kiwi chef,

01:13.607 --> 01:18.912
and she's really blazing
a trail, putting Maori
cuisine firmly on the map.

01:19.980 --> 01:24.718
She's somewhere down there
in the middle of nowhere.

01:49.810 --> 01:52.179
GORDON: Monique! Finally!
MONIQUE: Gordon!

01:52.179 --> 01:53.880
GORDON: Good to see you!
MONIQUE: How are you?

01:53.880 --> 01:55.916
GORDON: Good to see you, love.
Are you good?

01:55.916 --> 01:56.950
MONIQUE: I'm great.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.285
GORDON: What an amazing place!

01:58.285 --> 02:00.253
MONIQUE: Welcome
to New Zealand.

02:00.954 --> 02:04.625
GORDON: Monique Fiso is one
of New Zealand's top chefs,

02:04.625 --> 02:06.960
trained in Michelin
starred restaurants

02:06.960 --> 02:09.563
but passionate about
her Maori heritage.

02:10.731 --> 02:14.801
She's on a one‐woman
mission to blend the
food of her ancestors

02:14.801 --> 02:17.804
with the world of fine dining.

02:18.872 --> 02:22.576
Now, I've never ever ventured
into that Maori cuisine.

02:22.576 --> 02:24.811
So what do I
need to understand?

02:24.811 --> 02:26.513
MONIQUE: There's
four main ecosystems.

02:26.513 --> 02:29.549
There's the oceans
and the river, that's
Tangaroa, God of the Sea;

02:29.549 --> 02:32.753
and then there's the
mountains and the forest,

02:32.753 --> 02:34.588
Papa‐tu‐a‐nuku,
Earth Mother.

02:34.588 --> 02:36.623
GORDON: Papa what?
MONIQUE: Papa‐tu‐a‐nuku.

02:36.623 --> 02:37.891
GORDON: Okay. Papatuawaku.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.426
MONIQUE: Papa‐tu‐a‐nuku.

02:39.426 --> 02:40.861
GORDON: Papa‐tu‐a‐nuku.

02:40.861 --> 02:42.963
MONIQUE: That's the one.
It's a complex cuisine.

02:42.963 --> 02:44.765
There's a lot of
customs involved.

02:44.765 --> 02:47.734
It's not just about,
you know, growing food
and just making it.

02:47.734 --> 02:52.105
There's a lot of like
different traditions that are
interwoven in all of the food.

02:55.876 --> 02:59.112
GORDON: The Maori first
arrived in New Zealand on
pioneering voyages from

02:59.112 --> 03:01.748
Polynesia in the 13th century.

03:02.649 --> 03:04.518
Although they brought
some crops with them,

03:04.518 --> 03:08.155
much of their diet relied
on hunting and gathering
from the forest and ocean,

03:08.155 --> 03:11.358
a tradition which Maori
chefs like Monique are

03:11.358 --> 03:13.927
keeping alive through
their cooking.

03:15.162 --> 03:18.131
Now, foraging, is it
big on the menu here?

03:18.131 --> 03:20.333
MONIQUE: It is big
on the menu here.

03:20.333 --> 03:23.003
A lot of the time, it's the
only way to get your hands on
these ingredients.

03:23.003 --> 03:24.705
GORDON: Wow!

03:24.705 --> 03:26.840
MONIQUE: And, as you can see,
I've got two machetes, one of
which is for you.

03:26.840 --> 03:29.242
GORDON: That's my machete?
MONIQUE: That's your machete.

03:29.242 --> 03:32.179
GORDON: What?

03:32.179 --> 03:33.647
MONIQUE: Ask all the
chefs at my restaurant.

03:33.647 --> 03:35.148
We all own a machete each.

03:35.148 --> 03:37.317
GORDON: I know, but you
don't walk home at night
with this thing, do you?

03:37.317 --> 03:38.919
MONIQUE: No, we
tuck in our backpacks.

03:38.919 --> 03:40.487
GORDON: You tuck it
in your backpack?

03:40.487 --> 03:42.556
These machetes are lethal!

03:43.857 --> 03:47.728
Monique is a woman
I'm definitely not
going to argue with,

03:47.728 --> 03:50.864
especially when she's on
the hunt for wild food.

03:51.898 --> 03:55.235
So this is not like walking
down a supermarket aisle.

03:55.235 --> 03:59.673
MONIQUE: No, this is all the
hard work we do to get the
food we need to eat.

04:02.209 --> 04:04.945
GORDON: They're everywhere.
Monique, really?

04:04.945 --> 04:06.847
MONIQUE: Yeah.
Keep going, Chef!

04:06.847 --> 04:09.683
GORDON: Seriously? (bleep).

04:10.650 --> 04:13.386
But these vines are
more than just a jungle gym.

04:13.386 --> 04:16.089
At their tip is a
secret Maori delicacy.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.725
MONIQUE: So these are
the young shoots that
come off the vines,

04:18.725 --> 04:20.260
they're super tender.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.762
GORDON: Wow!
You can eat that?

04:21.762 --> 04:23.730
MONIQUE: You can eat that.
They're hard to find.

04:23.730 --> 04:26.066
It's like a bush asparagus.

04:26.066 --> 04:29.536
Give it a try!
They're really good.

04:29.903 --> 04:31.505
GORDON: They are good.
They are like asparagus.

04:31.505 --> 04:32.572
MONIQUE: Mm.

04:32.572 --> 04:33.673
GORDON: So soft and delicate.

04:33.673 --> 04:36.543
MONIQUE: Yeah.
GORDON: Delicious!

04:37.944 --> 04:42.015
All I can see in this
tangled forest are potential
personal injury claims.

04:42.015 --> 04:43.884
MONIQUE: Oh,
here's a good one!

04:43.884 --> 04:47.487
GORDON: But for Machete
Monique, it's like an
all you can eat buffet.

04:47.921 --> 04:48.955
What's that?

04:48.955 --> 04:50.590
MONIQUE: Horopito.
GORDON: Horopito.

04:50.590 --> 04:52.325
MONIQUE: Yes, it's a
native bush pepper tree.

04:52.325 --> 04:53.560
GORDON: Wow!

04:53.560 --> 04:55.462
MONIQUE: It's super
spicy, super peppery.

04:55.462 --> 04:57.330
Have a munch on that.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.566
GORDON: Wow!

04:59.566 --> 05:01.201
MONIQUE: Boy, that's
one's spicy! Woo!

05:01.201 --> 05:03.370
GORDON: That is spicy.
That's incredible, from that.
MONIQUE: Mm.

05:03.370 --> 05:05.071
GORDON: Quite
numb now, my tongue.

05:05.071 --> 05:06.306
MONIQUE: Yeah.
GORDON: From hot...

05:06.306 --> 05:07.707
MONIQUE: And it's going to
stay that way for a while!

05:07.707 --> 05:09.543
GORDON: Is it?

05:11.945 --> 05:16.249
There's now a full‐scale
forest fire in my mouth,
but Monique's not done yet.

05:17.184 --> 05:20.120
It's amazing. From the beach,
it doesn't look that steep.

05:20.120 --> 05:24.090
She's got another
surprise for me, high up
in the forest canopy.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.893
That is deep in
there, Monique!

05:26.893 --> 05:28.028
MONIQUE: I know!
It's a good workout.

05:28.028 --> 05:29.162
GORDON: Isn't it?

05:29.162 --> 05:30.530
MONIQUE: Next challenge.

05:30.530 --> 05:33.433
This is a fuchsia tree,
and the best thing
about this tree...

05:33.433 --> 05:35.035
GORDON: Go on.
MONIQUE: ...the berries.

05:35.035 --> 05:37.971
And they're
usually way up high.

05:37.971 --> 05:41.408
So the best ones are
bright purple and
they're super sweet.

05:41.408 --> 05:42.676
GORDON: Yeah?

05:42.676 --> 05:44.277
MONIQUE: But they're just a
bit of a pain to get, so...

05:44.277 --> 05:45.712
GORDON: So we just shake the
tree and they'll drop down?

05:45.712 --> 05:47.480
MONIQUE: No, you're
going to have to go up.

05:47.480 --> 05:48.949
GORDON: Seriously?
MONIQUE: Yeah.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.684
GORDON: Are you sure they'll
take my weight, the branches?

05:50.684 --> 05:53.386
MONIQUE: We'll soon find out.

06:01.595 --> 06:02.929
I'll wait here.

06:02.929 --> 06:04.998
GORDON: That's
very kind of you.

06:09.102 --> 06:12.539
Honestly, you said,
"Come foraging," right?

06:12.539 --> 06:13.773
MONIQUE: Yeah.

06:13.773 --> 06:16.009
I didn't say it would
all be on the ground.

06:16.910 --> 06:19.246
Just a little bit further now.

06:19.246 --> 06:21.481
GORDON: Oh, (bleep)!
Did you hear that?

06:21.481 --> 06:26.853
MONIQUE: I heard that!
Go! Like Tarzan up there.

06:29.289 --> 06:30.390
GORDON: Can you see them?

06:30.390 --> 06:32.325
MONIQUE: I can see them
right in front of you.

06:32.325 --> 06:34.594
GORDON: Right.

06:38.865 --> 06:40.867
Bloody hell, it's windy!

06:42.836 --> 06:44.638
So, the bright
purple ones, right?

06:44.638 --> 06:47.173
MONIQUE: Bright purple, those
are the ones we're after.

06:47.173 --> 06:49.009
If you toss them down.

06:49.009 --> 06:51.011
GORDON: They look
like tiny dates.

06:53.380 --> 06:54.414
Wow!

06:54.414 --> 06:55.715
MONIQUE: How good are those?

06:55.715 --> 06:58.285
GORDON: It's almost
like a treetop dessert.

06:58.285 --> 07:02.055
MONIQUE: I just think they're
one of the best ingredients
that we have in this country.

07:02.055 --> 07:04.257
GORDON: They're bloody tasty.
Fuchsia berries!

07:04.257 --> 07:06.493
MONIQUE: Fuchsia berries.

07:08.061 --> 07:10.764
GORDON: Pretty hairy,
scaling that tree,
especially the wind.

07:10.764 --> 07:14.467
But another hidden gem, and
what a delicious little berry.

07:14.467 --> 07:17.637
There's no seeds inside, so
that's the nice thing, so it's
just bursting with flavor.

07:18.204 --> 07:19.606
The pain in the arse was,

07:19.606 --> 07:21.875
they're at the top of the
tree, not the bottom.

07:33.386 --> 07:34.921
That was amazing in there.

07:34.921 --> 07:37.724
Fascinating
flavors, contrasts.

07:38.792 --> 07:42.896
No‐one's cultivating
it and growing it in
kilos, it's found wild.

07:42.896 --> 07:45.265
That's the beginning
of the journey for me.

07:45.265 --> 07:47.634
MONIQUE: Maoris have lived
this way for centuries,

07:47.634 --> 07:49.636
just living off the
ocean and the land.

07:49.636 --> 07:50.971
GORDON: Yeah.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.173
MONIQUE: And I'm
preparing a huge feast
at the end of this week,

07:53.173 --> 07:54.341
for the local tribe.

07:54.341 --> 07:55.375
GORDON: Really? Right.

07:55.375 --> 07:56.643
MONIQUE: There's going
to be a lot of elders.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.545
They are basically the
keepers of the land.

07:58.545 --> 07:59.846
GORDON: Wow!

07:59.846 --> 08:02.215
MONIQUE: They understand this
land better than any of us.

08:02.215 --> 08:03.984
Why don't you come along?

08:03.984 --> 08:06.987
GORDON: So, cook at
the end of the week
together for the tribe?

08:06.987 --> 08:08.188
MONIQUE: Yes.

08:08.188 --> 08:10.190
GORDON: Yeah, I'd love to.

08:10.590 --> 08:12.592
MONIQUE: This is an
enormous challenge for Gordon.

08:12.592 --> 08:15.028
A lot of these ingredients,
he's never tasted before.

08:15.028 --> 08:18.398
So, it's a totally
different ball game.

08:19.566 --> 08:24.337
GORDON: A little bit nervous,
because I've never come across
those berries and ferns and

08:24.337 --> 08:27.240
leaves, but I'm not too
sure what to do with them yet.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.976
So that's the
difficult part up here.

08:31.678 --> 08:35.215
With the feast just five
days away, I need a crash
course in Maori cuisine.

08:42.689 --> 08:47.861
So, Monique's sending me
on a mission to discover
New Zealand's finest foods

08:48.962 --> 08:52.732
from the land and ocean, which
is where I'm exploring today.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.734
Zane, good morning!

08:54.734 --> 08:56.669
With 13th generation
fisherman, Zane.

08:56.669 --> 09:00.006
Who, like many Stewart
Islanders, is of mixed descent,

09:00.006 --> 09:02.976
from both Maori and
European settlers.

09:03.643 --> 09:05.412
What a gorgeous spot!

09:05.412 --> 09:07.080
ZANE: Yes, nice spot, eh?
GORDON: It is beautiful.

09:07.080 --> 09:10.417
Now, Monique suggested
I get to meet you but,
more importantly,

09:10.417 --> 09:13.019
she said you're going
fishing this morning, so I'd
love to be part of that.

09:13.019 --> 09:14.621
ZANE: Yeah, absolutely,
you're most welcome.

09:14.621 --> 09:16.990
GORDON: Yeah?
ZANE: Yeah. Let's go!

09:18.091 --> 09:20.727
GORDON: Waiting aboard
is Zane's first mate.

09:21.528 --> 09:22.896
Morning, sir!

09:22.896 --> 09:26.032
A salty old
seadog known as Fluff.

09:27.767 --> 09:28.835
So what's your real name?

09:28.835 --> 09:30.503
FLUFF: Gordon.
GORDON: No, stop it!

09:30.503 --> 09:32.072
Gordon's a
(bleep) name, right?

09:32.072 --> 09:33.273
FLUFF: That's right, yeah.

09:33.273 --> 09:34.374
GORDON: Yeah?
Fluff, you ready?

09:34.374 --> 09:36.276
FLUFF: Yeah.
GORDON: Let's go, boys.

09:39.746 --> 09:42.882
ZANE: We're (inaudible)
bay, good morning.

09:42.882 --> 09:45.518
<i>WOMAN (over radio):</i>
<i>(inaudible) good morning.</i>

09:46.286 --> 09:49.456
GORDON: With over 200 years of
fishing history in his blood,

09:49.456 --> 09:53.259
Zane knows these waters
better than most of
the fish around here.

09:56.329 --> 10:01.034
This morning, he's going to
fully immerse me in the life
of a Stewart Island fisherman.

10:03.236 --> 10:05.672
ZANE: You need this, and
these are your footwear.

10:05.672 --> 10:08.007
GORDON: Holy mackerel.
They're huge fins.

10:08.007 --> 10:09.576
So, free diving?

10:09.576 --> 10:11.311
ZANE: Yeah, free diving.

10:11.311 --> 10:14.214
We're going to catch paua,
which are a native New Zealand
abalone, highly prized.

10:15.949 --> 10:20.053
GORDON: Paua are a unique
species of abalone, only found
here in New Zealand.

10:21.020 --> 10:24.290
Monique tells me they're
one of the ocean's
greatest delicacies,

10:24.290 --> 10:27.393
regarded by the Maori
as a gift from the gods.

10:28.495 --> 10:30.797
ZANE: Here's the tool for
chipping the paua off the rocks.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.398
GORDON: It's like
a flat iron, huh?

10:32.398 --> 10:33.733
Fluff, can you free dive?

10:33.733 --> 10:35.135
FLUFF: No, mate.
GORDON: Not with that beard!

10:35.135 --> 10:37.570
FLUFF: No!
GORDON: Huh? Jeez! Man!

10:37.570 --> 10:38.805
FLUFF: The mask always leaks.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.273
GORDON: The mask
always leaks, yeah.

10:40.273 --> 10:42.475
Okay. Let's go!

10:44.110 --> 10:45.345
Seriously?

10:45.345 --> 10:47.580
Fluff, can you just tie a
knot in that for me, please?

10:49.082 --> 10:51.851
(inaudible) Man!

10:55.021 --> 10:56.322
ZANE: So, are you all set?

10:56.322 --> 10:57.524
GORDON: Yep, ready to go!

10:57.524 --> 10:59.659
ZANE: Cool. One last thing.

11:16.376 --> 11:19.112
GORDON: I'm off the coast of
New Zealand's Stewart Island,

11:19.112 --> 11:22.048
diving for paua, a much
sought‐after shellfish.

11:25.752 --> 11:29.522
With no sharks in
sight, my guide, Zane,
shows me how it's done.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.927
Looks easy enough.

11:33.927 --> 11:36.963
Now it's my turn.
Here we go!

11:38.932 --> 11:41.801
Paua cling to the
rocks on the sea bed.

11:42.936 --> 11:48.808
But there's so much kelp down
here, I can't find them and,
after just a few seconds,

11:48.808 --> 11:51.311
I'm gasping for air.

11:51.311 --> 11:54.347
That's a lot harder than
it looks, controlling
the breathing.

11:54.881 --> 11:56.516
Oh man!

11:58.818 --> 12:01.554
GORDON: There's a little surge
there as well, so you get
pushed around a lot as well.

12:03.356 --> 12:05.058
GORDON: Exactly.

12:05.258 --> 12:09.062
Paua are a protected
species and can only be
harvested by free divers.

12:10.396 --> 12:13.600
Amateurs like me have
a daily limit of ten.

12:14.834 --> 12:16.869
That's hard. Bah!

12:16.869 --> 12:18.571
ZANE: If it was easy,
everybody would be doing it.

12:18.571 --> 12:21.074
GORDON: But at this rate
I'll be lucky to get one.

12:23.509 --> 12:24.544
GORDON: Really?
ZANE: Yeah.

12:24.544 --> 12:25.778
GORDON: To the right?

12:28.081 --> 12:30.183
GORDON: Okay. Nice one.

12:40.026 --> 12:44.197
At last I can see my bounty,
but prizing them off the
rocks is a lot tougher

12:44.197 --> 12:46.499
than Zane made it look.

12:53.406 --> 12:54.941
ZANE: No?

12:54.941 --> 12:56.843
GORDON: You can't
touch them first.

13:01.381 --> 13:05.018
GORDON: In Maori legend,
paua were compared to
mighty warriors,

13:05.018 --> 13:09.222
able to overcome
their opponents with
stubborn strength.

13:09.222 --> 13:13.493
But surely I'm not going
to be out‐muscled by a
six‐inch shellfish.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.194
Bloody hell!
ZANE: Yeah.

13:15.194 --> 13:17.297
GORDON: I'm holding
it in my hands while
I try to pull it off.

13:23.269 --> 13:25.171
GORDON: Damn!

13:25.538 --> 13:29.309
Monique sent me here to
gather a key ingredient
for our final feast.

13:30.043 --> 13:33.079
Somehow, I think
failure isn't an option.

13:38.751 --> 13:42.555
Yeah! Woo!
Oh, that's a beauty!

13:59.072 --> 14:01.207
Well, that's two runts.

14:01.207 --> 14:03.509
GORDON: Woo! Wow!
They're so beautiful.

14:03.943 --> 14:06.379
Woo!

14:07.714 --> 14:11.050
Just a few more and I'll
have enough for our feast.

14:25.832 --> 14:29.335
The question is, are
they as tasty as Monique
and Zane say they are?

14:30.236 --> 14:34.907
We're having a fish fry on
the beach, and that means
I get to use the F word.

14:35.541 --> 14:36.743
Fluff!

14:36.743 --> 14:37.810
FLUFF: Hey!

14:37.810 --> 14:39.412
GORDON: When did you
catch those buggers?

14:40.880 --> 14:41.914
GORDON: Serious?
FLUFF: Yeah.

14:41.914 --> 14:43.316
GORDON: Blue cod. Amazing!

14:43.316 --> 14:44.751
So, how are you going
to cook these things?

14:46.386 --> 14:47.487
GORDON: In kelp?

14:47.887 --> 14:48.988
GORDON: Yeah.

14:48.988 --> 14:50.490
Is this the same kelp
that we were diving in?

14:50.490 --> 14:52.258
FLUFF: Diving
amongst it, yeah.
GORDON: Wow!

14:55.595 --> 14:58.197
GORDON: And so you
literally make this
little pocket, right?

15:02.435 --> 15:04.537
GORDON: What a great idea. So
that'll burn, that will steam.

15:04.537 --> 15:05.671
ZANE: Yeah.
FLUFF: Yeah.

15:05.671 --> 15:08.241
GORDON: Amazing!
That'll go all the way now.

15:09.041 --> 15:12.945
I've heard of boil in a
bag, but boil in a kelp
is a new one on me.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.047
How cool is that?

15:15.047 --> 15:17.116
No seasoning, because
honestly the kelp will give
it the saltiness, right?

15:17.116 --> 15:18.351
FLUFF: Yeah.

15:18.351 --> 15:20.253
GORDON: Look at that! It's
like a little satchel. Huh?

15:20.620 --> 15:22.255
It's like a little bum bag.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.891
Who needs an oven when
you've got this out here.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.193
I can't wait to taste that.

15:27.193 --> 15:28.928
FLUFF: It won't
take very long at all.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.197
GORDON: There's just enough
time to prepare the paua.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.233
GORDON: So, how do
you get these out?

15:34.233 --> 15:36.335
ZANE: You put your
thumb in, try and get
hard against the shell.

15:36.335 --> 15:37.603
GORDON: Right.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.772
ZANE: And when you feel that
hard muscle in front of you,

15:39.772 --> 15:41.808
just keep pushing and try
and get underneath it.

15:42.241 --> 15:43.743
It'll pop.

15:43.743 --> 15:45.077
GORDON: Man, that's
how you get them out?

15:45.077 --> 15:46.245
ZANE: Yeah.
See, it pops.

15:46.245 --> 15:49.115
GORDON: Wow! It's incredible
how firm they are.

15:50.850 --> 15:53.986
Some chefs would gently
tenderize this delicacy,

15:54.353 --> 15:56.689
but that's not how
they do it here.

15:56.689 --> 15:58.791
ZANE: So we wrap them
up in a cloth and give
them a smack with a rock.

15:58.791 --> 15:59.792
GORDON: Really?
ZANE: Yeah.

15:59.792 --> 16:00.893
GORDON: And this is
how we tenderize them?

16:00.893 --> 16:02.428
ZANE: Yeah.

16:03.930 --> 16:05.765
GORDON: So we're literally
just going to fry these now.

16:05.765 --> 16:06.966
What would you normally do?

16:06.966 --> 16:08.668
ZANE: I like them for
breakfast fried whole.

16:08.668 --> 16:10.770
GORDON: Fried...
ZANE: With a couple of eggs
and a bit of steak sauce.

16:10.770 --> 16:13.539
GORDON: Seriously?
What a delicacy!

16:16.042 --> 16:17.043
Just throw it in?

16:17.043 --> 16:18.478
ZANE: Yeah, I reckon.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.279
GORDON: And that
is incredible.

16:20.279 --> 16:22.615
It's like stunning
rib‐eyes from the sea, huh?

16:22.615 --> 16:25.384
ZANE: Yeah.
GORDON: Wow, beautiful!

16:26.219 --> 16:29.522
Traditionally, paua
were served to high
ranking Maori guests.

16:30.556 --> 16:34.560
I'm pretty sure none of them
were called Fluff, but there's
a first time for everything.

16:39.932 --> 16:41.334
Fluff, now you're
getting the little one.

16:41.334 --> 16:42.301
ZANE: Oh yeah!

16:42.301 --> 16:43.402
GORDON: Because
you didn't dive.

16:43.402 --> 16:45.471
ZANE: Oh yeah!

16:45.471 --> 16:47.440
GORDON: I'm dying
to taste these, huh?

16:47.440 --> 16:49.308
Cheers, guys!

16:53.212 --> 16:56.883
My God! They are delicious.

16:56.883 --> 16:58.451
It's amazing how
tender they are now.

16:59.485 --> 17:00.586
GORDON: Huh?

17:05.258 --> 17:08.394
GORDON: Now for Fluff's
kelp‐cooked blue cod.

17:08.394 --> 17:10.029
Wow!

17:14.233 --> 17:15.201
Fluff!

17:15.201 --> 17:16.369
FLUFF: Hey!

17:16.369 --> 17:18.538
GORDON: I love you.
That is steamed to perfection.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.606
Was that a fluke, or
are you the real deal?

17:20.606 --> 17:22.074
FLUFF: I'm the real deal.

17:22.074 --> 17:24.076
GORDON: You're the real deal?
FLUFF: Yeah!

17:25.978 --> 17:27.914
GORDON: What an
extraordinary day.

17:27.914 --> 17:31.851
I've understood how
precious the water is,

17:31.851 --> 17:34.320
what they get from the
sea and how they live.

17:34.320 --> 17:39.458
Now I've got to put all
this together and somehow
cook a meal of a lifetime,

17:39.458 --> 17:44.497
because there's no excuse,
because so far the ingredients
have been second to none.

17:45.431 --> 17:50.269
Gathering those paua by hand
has given me a fascinating
insight into how little

17:50.269 --> 17:53.673
ocean foraging has changed since
the days of Zane's ancestors,

17:53.673 --> 17:57.109
and I'm hoping I'm
now one step closer to

17:57.109 --> 18:00.680
earning a place at Monique's
side for our final feast.

18:01.914 --> 18:04.450
Gents, what a treat.
Thank you.

18:04.450 --> 18:08.287
I promise next time I'll
stay down there longer, yeah?

18:08.688 --> 18:10.590
ZANE: Don't give
up your day job!

18:10.590 --> 18:11.891
GORDON: I'd be skint, right?

18:11.891 --> 18:13.926
ZANE: You'd be
very, very poor.

18:21.901 --> 18:24.670
GORDON: Day three
in New Zealand, and
it's blowing a gale.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.508
I'm about to fly
to the mountains...

18:35.514 --> 18:39.285
but my pilot looks more
like he's just out of
diapers than flight school.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.020
Good morning!

18:41.020 --> 18:42.221
JOEL: How you going?
Joel, nice to meet you.

18:42.221 --> 18:44.223
GORDON: Is Dad here?
JOEL: Dad? No.

18:44.223 --> 18:45.758
GORDON: You're the captain.
JOEL: I'm the captain, mate.

18:45.758 --> 18:47.026
GORDON: Seriously?
JOEL: Jump on in!

18:47.026 --> 18:48.861
GORDON: Where's the co‐pilot?
JOEL: You're the co‐pilot.

18:48.861 --> 18:51.364
GORDON: Oh Jeez, really?
Are you kidding me?

19:01.674 --> 19:04.777
Baby‐faced Joel is flying me
north to the South Island,

19:04.777 --> 19:08.481
where I'll continue my
quest for ingredients
for the final feast.

19:10.383 --> 19:14.253
Now, this is where I want
to really learn about the
food of New Zealand,

19:14.253 --> 19:20.493
mountains and rivers, and
my first destination is
somewhere right down there.

19:21.794 --> 19:26.165
Alongside that, flying
with a pilot that's
barely 12 years old.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.635
Date of birth is what?

19:31.303 --> 19:33.005
GORDON: Born in '96?

19:33.005 --> 19:35.541
I'd opened my 14th
restaurant by then.

19:39.378 --> 19:41.681
The wind's throwing this
plane around like a rag doll.

19:44.917 --> 19:48.387
GORDON: Something young
Joel probably still keeps
next to his pillow.

19:55.428 --> 19:57.797
Not bad at all.

19:57.797 --> 19:59.965
Thank God he didn't
(bleep) that one up!

20:00.199 --> 20:01.867
Sorry, is that on the airwave?

20:01.867 --> 20:03.436
JOEL: Uh, I don't care. (bleep).

20:14.146 --> 20:16.982
GORDON: This is the
spectacular Matukituki river.

20:16.982 --> 20:22.221
Fed by towering glaciers,
it's the perfect place to
find my next Maori delicacy.

20:23.656 --> 20:27.393
Now, Monique's arranged
for me to meet this
incredible eel fisherman.

20:27.393 --> 20:30.596
She said you'll recognize
him when you spot him.

20:42.241 --> 20:45.211
Jeremy! How are you, sir?

20:47.546 --> 20:49.415
JEREMY: Good to
see you, brother!

20:49.415 --> 20:50.616
GORDON: Good to see you!

20:50.616 --> 20:51.817
JEREMY: Good to
see you, brother.

20:51.817 --> 20:53.953
I'm going to give you a
traditional Maori greeting.

20:53.953 --> 20:55.221
This is called the hongi.

20:55.221 --> 20:56.889
GORDON: Horny?
JEREMY: Hongi.

20:56.889 --> 20:57.990
GORDON: Hongi.
Excuse me.

20:57.990 --> 21:00.593
JEREMY: Nothing
horny about me, son!

21:01.527 --> 21:04.797
The touching of the
noses allows us to
share our sacred breath.

21:04.797 --> 21:06.065
GORDON: Amazing.

21:06.065 --> 21:07.633
JEREMY: Come on the boat,
mate, we're going for a ride.

21:07.633 --> 21:09.668
GORDON: Thank you, man.

21:20.312 --> 21:23.282
Invented by a
thrill‐seeking Kiwi...

21:23.282 --> 21:25.751
The speed is insane.

21:25.751 --> 21:29.321
...jet boats can hit 50 miles
an hour and are purpose built

21:29.321 --> 21:31.724
for New Zealand's
fast‐flowing shallow rivers.

21:32.324 --> 21:35.961
JEREMY: It's the only way to
travel when you're doing a
traditional Maori (inaudible).

21:35.961 --> 21:38.397
GORDON: My God!

21:41.033 --> 21:44.170
They can also do this.

21:49.708 --> 21:51.877
(bleep)!

21:53.212 --> 21:57.416
25 miles upriver, we've
reached Jeremy's secret
eel fishing location.

21:58.918 --> 22:00.619
JEREMY: And this is
where we get off.

22:00.619 --> 22:03.088
GORDON: We're
getting off here?
JEREMY: Yeah.

22:03.088 --> 22:06.258
GORDON: Eels are one of
the most highly valued
foods in Maori cuisine.

22:06.258 --> 22:07.827
JEREMY: Are you
ready, brother?

22:07.827 --> 22:09.762
GORDON: Let's go, captain.

22:11.697 --> 22:14.967
And, having spent a lifetime
studying Maori culture...

22:17.736 --> 22:20.973
That is beautiful.
What a waterfall.

22:21.607 --> 22:25.578
...today, Jeremy's going
to teach me a traditional
method of catching them.

22:25.578 --> 22:27.179
Would you find
the eels in here?

22:27.179 --> 22:29.548
JEREMY: They can
be everywhere.

22:29.548 --> 22:31.383
They're coming up the creek...

22:31.383 --> 22:32.585
GORDON: Right.

22:32.585 --> 22:34.220
JEREMY: And they will travel
up that waterfall there.

22:34.220 --> 22:35.521
GORDON: Really?

22:35.521 --> 22:37.056
JEREMY: They've got a mouth
that they can suction onto it,

22:37.056 --> 22:38.724
and they'll travel in thousands.

22:38.724 --> 22:40.326
GORDON: Up the waterfall?

22:40.326 --> 22:42.494
JEREMY: Up the waterfall.

22:47.032 --> 22:48.667
GORDON: So, this is
your favorite pool.

22:48.667 --> 22:50.135
JEREMY: This is the pool.

22:50.135 --> 22:51.971
GORDON: Yeah.

22:51.971 --> 22:55.241
JEREMY: Once you start chasing
them, they're going to want to
come and try their best to

22:55.241 --> 23:00.913
look like a log or just get
well away from you by tucking
in under the bank here,

23:01.213 --> 23:03.148
so you're going to
fish around for it.

23:03.148 --> 23:06.385
GORDON: So there's no
line, there's no rod,
there's no bait.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.754
So the idea is what?

23:10.122 --> 23:12.224
JEREMY: You're going
to use your hands.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.826
They're slippery suckers.

23:13.826 --> 23:15.928
GORDON: Stop it!
Do they have teeth?
Do they bite?

23:15.928 --> 23:18.430
JEREMY: They have teeth.
They bite.

23:18.430 --> 23:20.833
Big fellow like you,
you'll be alright though.

23:22.234 --> 23:24.870
GORDON: (bleep) That's cold.

23:26.872 --> 23:28.474
JEREMY: Was that
something there?

23:28.474 --> 23:30.342
GORDON: No.

23:30.342 --> 23:33.279
JEREMY: No, I just saw a bit
of murky water, suggests that
something made that above us.

23:36.682 --> 23:38.384
Just here. Just here.

23:38.384 --> 23:39.585
GORDON: Stop it.

23:39.585 --> 23:41.887
JEREMY: Can you see this?
Quietly, quietly, quietly.

23:41.887 --> 23:44.456
GORDON: Oh, (bleep)!
That's a tree.

23:44.456 --> 23:49.128
JEREMY: No! That's an eel.
Don't let him get away.

23:49.795 --> 23:53.198
Both hands under his
belly and you're going
to flick him up to me.

23:53.899 --> 23:56.068
You can do it, both
hands, both hands at once.

23:58.237 --> 24:00.639
GORDON: (bleep) He's
gone back under now.

24:00.639 --> 24:02.641
Where's he gone?

24:06.512 --> 24:07.680
GORDON: Can you see it?

24:07.680 --> 24:09.848
JEREMY: He's under
the bank somewhere.

24:10.983 --> 24:13.018
Yes, I can see him.

24:13.018 --> 24:15.721
GORDON: Here. Gotcha!

24:16.322 --> 24:20.492
I'm knee deep in the remote
backwaters of New Zealand's
Matukituki valley...

24:21.093 --> 24:24.163
Ah! Damn! He's gone
back under now.

24:24.163 --> 24:26.732
...attempting to
catch freshwater eels.

24:26.732 --> 24:30.102
JEREMY: Gordon, we've got
another one just beside you.

24:33.038 --> 24:35.341
He's a little bit bigger
than the one we've just seen.

24:35.341 --> 24:37.576
GORDON: That's not an
eel, that's a tree trunk.

24:37.576 --> 24:40.379
JEREMY: No, this is an
eel beside the tree trunk!

24:40.713 --> 24:42.815
GORDON: Damn.
Now I can see him.

24:42.815 --> 24:46.452
JEREMY: What if I use
that stick, so that I
don't get bitten,

24:46.452 --> 24:48.954
and you catch him
with your bare hands.

24:50.022 --> 24:51.123
Alright.

24:51.123 --> 24:52.825
No mucking around
on this one, Gordon.

24:52.825 --> 24:54.893
You're going to
lift it and throw it.

24:54.893 --> 24:58.063
GORDON: Right. (bleep).

24:58.063 --> 24:59.498
JEREMY: You have to
keep going, keep going!

24:59.498 --> 25:01.300
Just bring him out.
Bring him out!

25:01.300 --> 25:03.736
Yes, boy!
(bleep) Get him!

25:03.736 --> 25:06.839
GORDON: Oh damn!
They're so slippery.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.475
Right, where has he gone now?

25:09.475 --> 25:11.443
JEREMY: Don't move.
I can see a spine in there.

25:11.443 --> 25:13.979
You've got to make sure that
you can get him in such a way

25:13.979 --> 25:15.748
that you're supporting
his weight.

25:15.748 --> 25:16.915
GORDON: Yes.

25:16.915 --> 25:19.551
JEREMY: Because
he's a big boy.

25:19.551 --> 25:22.921
Get your hands under
there, sort of tickle
him, have him relax.

25:24.089 --> 25:25.557
You've got him now, right.

25:25.557 --> 25:27.393
You're totally
committed to this.

25:27.393 --> 25:29.261
I was born ready.

25:29.261 --> 25:32.197
GORDON: Let's go! Third time
lucky, come on! You ready?

25:32.197 --> 25:33.899
JEREMY: Yeah, I'm ready.

25:34.633 --> 25:37.636
Yes! Good boy! Got it!

25:38.871 --> 25:40.339
GORDON: Well,
that is not small.

25:40.339 --> 25:42.775
JEREMY: Go on,
you've done bloody well!

25:42.775 --> 25:45.544
GORDON: Look at the
size of that thing.

25:45.544 --> 25:48.047
My God!
He's beautiful.

25:48.047 --> 25:50.783
JEREMY: I reckon
he's a good 6 KG.

25:50.783 --> 25:52.451
GORDON: That's insane.

25:52.451 --> 25:54.586
JEREMY: You know,
he can survive out
of water for days...

25:54.586 --> 25:55.621
GORDON: Serious?

25:55.621 --> 25:57.589
JEREMY: ...if he had to.
They make great pets.

25:57.589 --> 25:59.892
Yeah, I know. You can
feed them and they're.

25:59.892 --> 26:01.894
No!

26:01.894 --> 26:03.228
GORDON: I'm just amazed.

26:03.228 --> 26:04.730
I'm amazed at
the size of them.

26:04.730 --> 26:06.799
JEREMY: I'm
amazed you kissed it.

26:08.434 --> 26:11.003
GORDON: The Maori have
been catching eels for
hundreds of years.

26:11.003 --> 26:12.271
Shall I put it back?

26:12.271 --> 26:14.106
JEREMY: Yeah, put him back.

26:14.106 --> 26:17.176
GORDON: But, according
to tradition, you only
take what you need,

26:17.176 --> 26:19.311
and since Jeremy has
already an eel to eat,

26:19.311 --> 26:21.447
we're letting this beauty go.

26:28.053 --> 26:30.789
GORDON: You didn't tell me the
size of a fricking anaconda.

26:30.789 --> 26:32.891
JEREMY: It was
awesome, hey, bro?

26:37.830 --> 26:40.666
GORDON: It turns out he's
not just an expert fisherman,

26:40.666 --> 26:43.635
he's also pretty handy
with a homemade smoker.

26:43.635 --> 26:48.040
That looks beautiful.
It's lightly smoked, right?

26:48.040 --> 26:49.875
JEREMY: It's lightly smoked.

26:49.875 --> 26:52.311
GORDON: Look how moist it is.

26:53.946 --> 26:56.915
Wow! That's delicious.
It's so sweet.

26:56.915 --> 26:58.884
JEREMY: Thank you, brother.

26:58.884 --> 27:01.587
GORDON: There's something
so important from a
chef's point of view

27:01.587 --> 27:03.722
to get that close
with the source.

27:03.722 --> 27:06.959
How important is the food with
a Maori connect for you now?

27:06.959 --> 27:08.794
JEREMY: It's all
about the puku, we say.

27:08.794 --> 27:09.928
GORDON: The puku.

27:09.928 --> 27:11.163
JEREMY: The puku,
the stomach, eh?

27:11.163 --> 27:12.664
GORDON: Uh‐huh.

27:12.664 --> 27:14.566
JEREMY: That's the source
of emotions and feelings
comes from the guts.

27:14.566 --> 27:15.767
GORDON: Yeah.

27:15.767 --> 27:18.904
JEREMY: And families used to
fight to protect the eels.

27:18.904 --> 27:20.739
GORDON: Really?

27:20.739 --> 27:24.476
JEREMY: It was that important
that we preserved not only the
food but the environment.

27:24.843 --> 27:29.148
Because with this eel comes
the environment as well, and
we're really proud of that.

27:32.351 --> 27:35.154
GORDON: Those delicacies
that I've discovered from
foraging the forest,

27:35.154 --> 27:39.191
to diving and now with that
eel on top of that, it's
almost like it's one of the

27:39.191 --> 27:42.294
best kept secrets in the
culinary world: Maori cuisine.

27:44.796 --> 27:49.234
They have so much real
close‐knit connect
with ingredients.

27:49.234 --> 27:50.669
It's spiritual.

27:50.669 --> 27:53.839
And now I've got a
pedigree of Maori insights,

27:54.506 --> 27:57.876
and I'm desperate
now to have a go.

27:58.744 --> 28:00.279
Thank you. Kia ora.

28:00.279 --> 28:03.382
JEREMY: Kia ora. Kia ora!

28:03.382 --> 28:06.018
GORDON: Kia ora.
JEREMY: Kia ora.

28:07.452 --> 28:10.956
GORDON: There's just one
more ingredient I need
for the final feast.

28:15.727 --> 28:20.165
Monique has instructed me
to head for the hills in
search of a mountain goat

28:21.733 --> 28:25.871
and, of course, she expects
me to hunt it myself,

28:25.871 --> 28:29.374
under the watchful eye
of guide, Dan Russell.

28:32.844 --> 28:38.016
Introduced to New Zealand in
the 18th century, goats are an
invasive species and,

28:38.016 --> 28:42.421
with no natural predators,
they've caused untold damage
to native vegetation.

28:43.422 --> 28:46.258
How desolated had the land
become because of the goats?

28:46.258 --> 28:47.759
Are they destroying that much?

28:47.759 --> 28:50.629
DAN: They're a real pest.
15 years ago they were
right out of control,

28:50.629 --> 28:52.664
and we need to control
them because New Zealand

28:52.664 --> 28:54.666
wasn't built to have
all these animals here.

28:54.666 --> 28:56.468
GORDON: Yeah.

28:56.902 --> 29:00.372
The Maori have always
sought to live in harmony
with their environment.

29:00.372 --> 29:03.642
Hunting invasive
species may be one way
for modern‐day Kiwis

29:03.642 --> 29:06.445
to help redress the balance.

29:06.778 --> 29:09.414
DAN: And the best side of it,
you get to take food home that
you've sourced yourself.

29:09.414 --> 29:10.549
GORDON: Sure.

29:10.549 --> 29:12.150
DAN: Cook it up
and be proud of it.

29:12.150 --> 29:15.220
GORDON: Yeah.
That's the important part.

29:24.363 --> 29:26.231
DAN: Beautiful big
free‐range goat.

29:26.231 --> 29:28.500
GORDON: Yeah.
The size of him.

29:29.568 --> 29:31.236
DAN: He knows we're here.

29:31.236 --> 29:33.205
So, I want to get so there's
a bit of a middle mound.

29:33.205 --> 29:34.606
We can go through the brush,

29:34.606 --> 29:36.108
there's going to be
nowhere for you to lay
down and get a shot.

29:36.108 --> 29:37.209
GORDON: No.

29:37.209 --> 29:38.877
DAN: We'll sneak up and
just put eyes on him.

29:38.877 --> 29:41.046
GORDON: Sure.

29:41.413 --> 29:42.814
DAN: I hoping that, when
we get round this ridge

29:42.814 --> 29:46.518
another 200 yards we'll
be in shootable range.

29:48.553 --> 29:51.456
GORDON: Sure enough,
just beyond the ridge...

29:51.456 --> 29:53.191
DAN: I see it just here.

29:53.191 --> 29:55.627
GORDON: ...we
spot two more goats.

29:55.627 --> 29:57.663
DAN: I'll try and get closer.

30:01.633 --> 30:04.670
GORDON: He's looking over.
DAN: Don't let it see you.

30:06.405 --> 30:09.941
GORDON: I need to act fast,
but we're on uneven ground,

30:09.941 --> 30:12.144
making my shot
extremely difficult.

30:12.144 --> 30:15.314
DAN: Dig that knee in, dig
your elbow into that leg.

30:15.314 --> 30:18.350
They're onto us.
So close the bolt.

30:22.621 --> 30:25.023
GORDON: (inaudible) Closed.

30:25.023 --> 30:26.391
DAN: Safety's off.
GORDON: Thank you.

30:26.391 --> 30:28.460
DAN: Just take your time.
How steady can you hold it?

30:28.460 --> 30:29.961
GORDON: Yeah.
Yeah, I'm on him now.

30:29.961 --> 30:31.196
DAN: And you reckon you
can shoot it like that?

30:31.196 --> 30:32.364
GORDON: Yeah, I'm on him now.

30:32.364 --> 30:33.732
DAN: The green light
to shoot if we can.

30:38.770 --> 30:42.908
DAN: Just take your time, and
you want to hit right on the
edge of the shoulder.

30:45.277 --> 30:48.980
GORDON: I'm hunting wild
mountain goats, high up in
New Zealand's southern alps.

30:48.980 --> 30:50.682
DAN: There you go,
there's your shot, there.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.784
Pull it tight
into your shoulder.

30:52.784 --> 30:54.686
Are we good to
shoot like that?

30:54.686 --> 30:56.588
GORDON: Yeah, I'm on him now.

30:56.588 --> 30:58.857
DAN: Alright, take your time.
We're not panicking.

30:59.958 --> 31:04.429
GORDON: (bleep)
DAN: Good work.

31:05.597 --> 31:07.666
(bleep) Good shooting!

31:07.666 --> 31:10.268
GORDON: Yeah, it's a
lot harder when you're
balancing in the air

31:10.268 --> 31:11.970
as opposed to laying right down.

31:11.970 --> 31:14.406
DAN: And I don't normally like
doing that shot, but we had no
other option here,

31:14.406 --> 31:15.974
and they're onto us.

31:15.974 --> 31:17.676
GORDON: No. And there's no
flat ground here, is there?

31:17.676 --> 31:20.178
DAN: I had confidence
you were going to hit him.

31:24.149 --> 31:25.851
GORDON: The heart's
beating like Big Ben.

31:25.851 --> 31:28.587
I mean your
adrenalin is pumping.

31:28.587 --> 31:32.257
It's windy, we're on the edge
of the cliff and the hard
thing was taking the shot on

31:32.257 --> 31:36.128
your knee as opposed to
lying flat and being,
you know, 100% accurate.

31:36.728 --> 31:41.833
But you had that split second
and you're down that barrel
and it's in your sight,

31:41.833 --> 31:43.869
you've got to take the shot.

31:43.869 --> 31:47.239
This is not wrapped up in
Clingfilm and stacked on the
shelf in a supermarket,

31:47.239 --> 31:50.442
this is proper
outdoor wild hunting.

31:51.376 --> 31:54.846
Monique stipulated, you know,
get into the mountains,
understand what we live off,

31:54.846 --> 31:58.683
and I'm happy that goat is big
enough now for both of us to
share and it's definitely

31:58.683 --> 32:01.653
going to be the
centerpiece for our cook.

32:10.662 --> 32:14.699
It's my final day in
New Zealand, and I'm
back on Stewart Island.

32:15.901 --> 32:17.702
Big day today.

32:17.702 --> 32:21.706
It's time to put everything
I've learnt into practice, so
a little bit nervous because

32:21.706 --> 32:23.775
I'm coming out of
my comfort zone.

32:24.576 --> 32:28.046
Tonight, I'll serve a
Maori inspired feast
to a group of elders

32:28.046 --> 32:29.981
with my kick‐ass mentor.

32:29.981 --> 32:31.049
Monique!

32:31.049 --> 32:32.751
MONIQUE: Gordon!
GORDON: I survived.

32:32.751 --> 32:34.686
MONIQUE: Oh, you survived?
GORDON: Oh my Lord! You good?

32:34.686 --> 32:36.121
MONIQUE: Oh, I'm excellent.

32:36.121 --> 32:38.924
GORDON: Let's just hope
this cook goes to plan.

32:38.924 --> 32:42.127
If not, Monique's going to
have my balls in a vice.

32:43.929 --> 32:45.397
MONIQUE: What have you got?

32:45.397 --> 32:48.066
GORDON: So, I've got my
herbs, I've got the goat,
I've got the paua.

32:48.066 --> 32:49.301
Shall I light the fire?

32:49.301 --> 32:51.002
MONIQUE: Not yet.
GORDON: Go on.

32:51.002 --> 32:53.004
MONIQUE: First, we
need to dig the pit.

32:53.004 --> 32:55.207
GORDON: The pit?
MONIQUE: The pit.

32:55.207 --> 32:58.376
Then we've got to light the
fire, heat these rocks until
they're glowing red.

32:58.376 --> 33:00.145
Then we're going to put
our food in the ground,

33:00.145 --> 33:02.047
and then we're going
to wait a few hours.

33:02.047 --> 33:04.916
Then we're going to dig it
back out as if it wasn't
painful enough to dig the

33:04.916 --> 33:07.986
hole in the first place, and
then we'll serve the food.

33:07.986 --> 33:09.621
GORDON: Why a pit?

33:09.621 --> 33:11.590
MONIQUE: Because
this is how we do it.
We're doing a hangi.

33:12.824 --> 33:15.026
GORDON: How far down?
MONIQUE: 2 feet.

33:15.026 --> 33:17.496
GORDON: Stop it!
MONIQUE: I'm not kidding.

33:20.165 --> 33:23.468
GORDON: Dating back to their
ancestors in Polynesia,
1,000 years ago...

33:23.468 --> 33:26.104
This is crazy!

33:26.104 --> 33:30.008
...the hangi is a
traditional Maori method of
cooking food in the ground.

33:30.008 --> 33:32.344
MONIQUE: So,
you've gone eeling.
GORDON: Yeah.

33:32.344 --> 33:34.079
MONIQUE: You've
gone goat hunting.
GORDON: Yeah.

33:34.079 --> 33:35.547
MONIQUE: You've gone diving.
GORDON: Yeah.

33:35.547 --> 33:36.948
MONIQUE: You've
gone into the forest.

33:36.948 --> 33:38.750
You've discovered all
these amazing things
about New Zealand.

33:38.750 --> 33:40.085
Are you ready for tonight?

33:40.085 --> 33:41.920
GORDON: To be honest, yeah,
I'm a little bit nervous

33:41.920 --> 33:44.756
now that I'm digging a
pit to cook my goat in.

33:44.756 --> 33:47.559
You didn't tell me at the
beginning of the week that
we would be digging a hole

33:47.559 --> 33:49.327
and cooking in a pit.

33:49.327 --> 33:51.096
MONIQUE: I always like
to leave a few surprises.

33:51.096 --> 33:52.163
Confident?

33:52.163 --> 33:54.266
GORDON: Yes!
MONIQUE: Oh, that was.

34:00.839 --> 34:04.009
GORDON: One hour of
hard labor later, we're
ready for stage two.

34:06.111 --> 34:07.913
We are flaming, girl!

34:07.913 --> 34:09.881
MONIQUE: This is going
to burn for two hours
so, in the meantime,

34:09.881 --> 34:12.817
we'll get all our stuff
ready to put in the pit.

34:19.257 --> 34:20.992
GORDON: Time to get cooking.

34:20.992 --> 34:25.096
Starting with my mountain goat
and those fiery leaves we
foraged from the forest.

34:25.997 --> 34:27.165
Right!

34:27.165 --> 34:29.367
Monique, what are you
rubbing your goat with?

34:29.367 --> 34:32.037
The horopito?

34:32.037 --> 34:33.672
MONIQUE: Using
horopito on yours?

34:33.672 --> 34:34.839
GORDON: Yes.

34:34.839 --> 34:36.141
MONIQUE: Me too.
Nice and spicy.

34:36.141 --> 34:37.542
GORDON: Nice and spicy.

34:37.542 --> 34:38.743
That's going to be
the pepper flavor in
there as well, right?

34:38.743 --> 34:40.378
MONIQUE: Yeah, that's right.

34:41.279 --> 34:45.884
GORDON: In my kitchens, I use
foil to wrap meat, but that's
not the Maori way.

34:45.884 --> 34:48.720
MONIQUE: Alright, no
tin foil, no worries.

34:49.788 --> 34:51.256
GORDON: We're
using puka leaves...

34:51.256 --> 34:53.224
Do we wrap veins
inside or outside?

34:53.224 --> 34:55.927
MONIQUE: Inside.

34:55.927 --> 34:58.296
GORDON: To stop the meat
drying out during cooking.

34:58.296 --> 35:00.966
And harakeke flax to
tie them together.

35:01.299 --> 35:02.500
That's one done.

35:02.500 --> 35:04.569
I mean it's a little bit
prehistoric, but it's done.

35:04.569 --> 35:06.204
Right, next one.

35:06.204 --> 35:07.806
MONIQUE: I'm just going
to check this real quick.

35:07.806 --> 35:09.841
Oh, oh! I think it's
coming undone, Chef!

35:09.841 --> 35:10.909
GORDON: Not tight enough.

35:10.909 --> 35:12.344
MONIQUE: I think you
might want to start again.

35:12.344 --> 35:14.112
GORDON: Bloody hell's bells.

35:14.112 --> 35:16.381
It looks easy tying
these things but it's
not, you know that?

35:16.381 --> 35:18.183
MONIQUE: Just like
your shoelace, Gordon.

35:18.183 --> 35:19.784
GORDON: Right.

35:19.784 --> 35:22.087
MONIQUE: I'm sure
your kids could do it.

35:23.555 --> 35:25.523
GORDON: Holy mackerel!

35:25.523 --> 35:28.627
Fragrant and highly strung,
and that's just me,

35:28.627 --> 35:32.197
our goat goes into baskets
lined with aromatic herbs.

35:32.564 --> 35:33.999
The sweet potatoes in as well?

35:33.999 --> 35:37.102
MONIQUE: Sweet potatoes
in, and we just put
them in the gaps.

35:37.902 --> 35:39.704
GORDON: Oh man!
MONIQUE: Heavy, huh?

35:39.704 --> 35:43.975
GORDON: Yeah. So too are
the now red‐hot rocks.

35:49.347 --> 35:51.383
(bleep) How hot is that?

35:51.383 --> 35:54.219
MONIQUE: Must be 1000 degrees.

35:57.222 --> 35:59.224
GORDON: (bleep).

35:59.224 --> 36:01.860
MONIQUE: Alright, almost there.

36:03.528 --> 36:06.464
Now let's get the
food on. Like that.

36:07.932 --> 36:10.635
GORDON: Next, the pit is
covered with soaking sacks

36:10.635 --> 36:13.004
to create a primitive
pressure cooker.

36:13.304 --> 36:17.375
MONIQUE: Then.
Oh, did you hear that?

36:17.375 --> 36:18.443
GORDON: Yeah.

36:18.443 --> 36:19.844
MONIQUE: That's
the steam starting.

36:19.844 --> 36:21.546
If you (inaudible) your shovel.

36:21.546 --> 36:24.916
GORDON: Finally, because I
haven't been punished enough
already, more shoveling.

36:24.916 --> 36:26.618
MONIQUE: Faster, Chef!

36:26.618 --> 36:30.288
GORDON: I've met some hard
workers in my time, but
Monique is on another level.

36:32.323 --> 36:36.127
If there's ever a cook that
complains about the stove,
I'm sending them to you.

36:36.127 --> 36:38.897
(bleep) (bleep)!

36:38.897 --> 36:41.766
What an amazing technique.
An underground oven.

36:41.766 --> 36:45.303
There's no cavity wall
insulation, there's no digital
clock to set the time.

36:45.303 --> 36:48.540
There's no convection.
You got a (bleep) hole, baby!

36:49.474 --> 36:53.712
So there's no fricking
way I can have a sneak
peek at my goat?

36:53.712 --> 36:54.979
MONIQUE: No.

36:54.979 --> 36:57.716
GORDON: You've buried it.
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

36:57.716 --> 36:59.417
MONIQUE: Your food is in
the hands of the gods.

36:59.417 --> 37:01.352
GORDON: May it
rise deliciously.

37:01.352 --> 37:03.655
I've never felt more
like a fish out of
water than I have today,

37:03.655 --> 37:05.323
because I can't
touch anything.

37:05.323 --> 37:08.126
I can't double check for
that level of perfection,
because that's it,

37:08.126 --> 37:12.630
it's in there now, and
roll on three and a half
hours, because if that,

37:12.630 --> 37:15.233
if that's not
cooked, I'm done.

37:15.867 --> 37:17.335
Can I go and lie down, please?

37:17.335 --> 37:19.471
MONIQUE: We've got
some sides to do.

37:19.471 --> 37:21.005
GORDON: Oh my Lord.
MONIQUE: Chef!

37:21.005 --> 37:23.742
GORDON: You are relentless.
MONIQUE: Chef, come on!

37:25.009 --> 37:28.246
GORDON: And, surprise,
surprise, Monique's
side dishes are hidden

37:28.246 --> 37:30.648
in an unusual place.

37:30.648 --> 37:32.117
Where are we going?

37:32.117 --> 37:34.719
MONIQUE: We're just going for
a little walk in the forest.

37:34.719 --> 37:38.089
GORDON: Something tells
me she isn't making
coleslaw and fries.

37:39.524 --> 37:41.126
MONIQUE: We need
to find some huhus.

37:41.126 --> 37:43.061
GORDON: Some what?
MONIQUE: Some huhu grubs.

37:43.061 --> 37:45.563
GORDON: Some huhu grubs?
MONIQUE: Yes.

37:45.563 --> 37:48.466
They live in fallen
wood, rotten wood.

37:48.466 --> 37:49.601
GORDON: Right.
MONIQUE: Here we go!

37:49.601 --> 37:51.336
GORDON: And
they'll be in here?

37:51.336 --> 37:53.705
MONIQUE: They'll be
right in the middle.

37:57.275 --> 37:59.377
There's a big market
for it in this country.

37:59.377 --> 38:00.445
GORDON: Seriously?

38:00.445 --> 38:01.780
MONIQUE: It's almost
as expensive as caviar.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.715
GORDON: Is it considered
as that much of a delicacy?

38:03.715 --> 38:05.416
MONIQUE: It's that
much of a delicacy.

38:05.416 --> 38:07.685
GORDON: Girl, you've lost it.
I'm telling you.

38:07.685 --> 38:09.087
MONIQUE: Too much
time in the bush!

38:09.087 --> 38:10.889
GORDON: Yes. Yes.

38:10.889 --> 38:13.158
MONIQUE: Just keep
cracking some of these open.

38:13.558 --> 38:16.795
Oh, there we go!
There we go!

38:16.795 --> 38:21.299
GORDON: Native to New Zealand,
huhu grubs are the larvae of
the longhorn beetle.

38:22.333 --> 38:24.269
MONIQUE: Oh yeah!
That's a grade A, I reckon.

38:24.269 --> 38:25.804
GORDON: You grade your grubs?

38:25.804 --> 38:27.105
MONIQUE: We grade the grubs.

38:27.105 --> 38:28.573
GORDON: Stop it!

38:28.573 --> 38:32.844
MONIQUE: Yeah, and
I'll happily pay 180 to
190 for one of these.

38:32.844 --> 38:34.779
GORDON: Really?
MONIQUE: Yeah.

38:34.779 --> 38:36.714
Ooh, that's a
nice fat guy, too.

38:36.714 --> 38:39.117
GORDON: (bleep)!
Monique, Monique!

38:39.117 --> 38:40.652
MONIQUE: Don't they
look delicious, Gordon?

38:40.652 --> 38:41.953
GORDON: They do
not look delicious.

38:41.953 --> 38:43.488
MONIQUE: Oh yes.
GORDON: So they taste of?

38:43.488 --> 38:45.657
MONIQUE: They taste of peanut.

38:46.891 --> 38:49.327
I know that does not look
like a jar of peanut butter.

38:49.327 --> 38:50.795
GORDON: You don't
eat it raw like that?

38:50.795 --> 38:52.096
MONIQUE: Yeah.

38:52.096 --> 38:54.833
That's its face, so it's
a little, little spikes.

38:54.833 --> 38:57.669
So those might bite
you on the way down.

38:57.669 --> 38:59.337
So you don't want
to start there.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.806
You want to pinch its
face and eat its tail.

39:03.274 --> 39:05.376
GORDON: So pinch this
end and bite there?

39:05.376 --> 39:06.845
MONIQUE: Yeah.

39:13.651 --> 39:15.587
MONIQUE: I'll tell you what.
I'll go first.

39:15.587 --> 39:17.789
GORDON: Please.
MONIQUE: Okay.

39:17.789 --> 39:22.327
GORDON: It's final feast day
in New Zealand, and the menu
has taken an unexpected turn.

39:23.261 --> 39:24.762
MONIQUE: Great! Mm!

39:24.762 --> 39:26.264
GORDON: (bleep).

39:35.940 --> 39:38.476
This is really
good, really creamy.

39:38.910 --> 39:41.246
(spits).

39:42.580 --> 39:44.515
GORDON: (bleep).

39:46.117 --> 39:48.786
They're (bleep) disgusting!

39:48.786 --> 39:50.021
MONIQUE: They're so good!

39:50.021 --> 39:51.389
GORDON: Peanut butter?
MONIQUE: Yeah.

39:51.389 --> 39:52.523
GORDON: Your peanut
butter must be different
to my peanut butter

39:52.523 --> 39:55.226
I grew up with. No,
that is not for me, no.

39:55.226 --> 39:56.261
MONIQUE: I'll show you.

39:56.261 --> 39:57.829
I'll show you how
they can be used.

39:57.829 --> 40:00.798
GORDON: Yeah, the only
thing that's nutty will
be the person eating them.

40:05.770 --> 40:08.273
We'll soon find out.

40:08.606 --> 40:12.310
While Monique pounds those
gross grubs into a pulp to
make a creamy sauce,

40:12.310 --> 40:16.681
I crack on with my
next dish, with another
ingredient from my travels.

40:17.115 --> 40:19.617
One of the dishes I am super
excited about is the eel,

40:19.617 --> 40:22.720
because getting those
things was incredible.

40:22.720 --> 40:26.090
So I'm just going to grill
this with a little ginger
Teriyaki glaze.

40:29.494 --> 40:31.095
Manuka honey.

40:31.095 --> 40:33.865
How exciting is that?

40:34.966 --> 40:39.504
Next, I'm going back to the
fuchsia, to make a chutney
to accompany the goat

40:39.504 --> 40:42.373
with those beautiful
berries I picked from
the top of the tree.

40:43.007 --> 40:46.911
So, caramelize the garlic,
shallots and ginger with a
little bit of raw cane sugar,

40:46.911 --> 40:48.579
with some butter.

40:48.579 --> 40:51.916
I'm gonna use the peppery
horopito leaves and then I'll
drop the berries in.

40:51.916 --> 40:53.818
MONIQUE: Are you
going to try the huhus?

40:53.818 --> 40:55.887
GORDON: May I?
MONIQUE: Go for it!

40:57.822 --> 40:59.757
GORDON: See now,
it tastes of peanut.

40:59.757 --> 41:01.292
MONIQUE: Exactly.
GORDON: See.

41:01.292 --> 41:05.229
How could it be so
delicious coming from that
disgusting rubbery bug?

41:12.337 --> 41:14.739
At the risk of sounding
like an animal undertaker.

41:14.739 --> 41:16.174
Is that going to be ready?

41:16.174 --> 41:18.042
MONIQUE: Looks ready to me.

41:18.042 --> 41:21.446
GORDON: It's now been three
agonizing hours since we've
buried our goat.

41:26.250 --> 41:27.885
That smell is incredible.

41:27.885 --> 41:29.387
It's almost like we've
opened the oven door.

41:29.387 --> 41:31.289
Okay, on three.
And again.

41:31.289 --> 41:32.490
MONIQUE: Three.

41:32.490 --> 41:34.258
GORDON: Heat
coming out of there!

41:34.258 --> 41:35.693
Right.

41:35.693 --> 41:36.828
MONIQUE: There we go!

41:36.828 --> 41:39.530
GORDON: The question
is, is the goat cooked?

41:41.833 --> 41:45.870
Oh my God!
Look at that!

41:45.870 --> 41:48.806
Seriously. Argh!

42:01.285 --> 42:03.021
Bam!

42:05.623 --> 42:08.860
It's almost time to
serve our Maori feast.

42:08.860 --> 42:11.662
Our honored
guests are arriving.

42:12.096 --> 42:14.999
They may have mixed ancestry
but, make no mistake,

42:14.999 --> 42:17.435
they take their Maori
heritage very seriously,

42:17.435 --> 42:20.238
especially when
it comes to food.

42:20.638 --> 42:21.806
MONIQUE: What, are
you still cooking?

42:21.806 --> 42:22.840
GORDON: Yeah, sorry.

42:22.840 --> 42:24.042
I'm going to be
super quick, okay?

42:24.042 --> 42:26.077
Literally 30 seconds, please.

42:26.077 --> 42:29.547
With kings of the ocean,
Zane and Fluff at the table,

42:29.547 --> 42:34.018
I'd be thrown to the
sharks if I didn't cook
them some pan fried paua.

42:35.987 --> 42:37.188
MONIQUE: (bleep) Oh God!

42:37.188 --> 42:38.756
(inaudible) if we
don't hurry up.

42:38.756 --> 42:40.291
GORDON: That was
just tenderizing the
paua, by the way.

42:40.291 --> 42:41.826
MONIQUE: Come on,
come on, hustle!

42:41.826 --> 42:43.227
GORDON: I'll be 30
seconds, I promise.

42:43.227 --> 42:45.396
Literally 30 seconds.

42:46.864 --> 42:48.800
MONIQUE: Guests
are staring at us.

42:48.800 --> 42:49.801
GORDON: Are they?

42:49.801 --> 42:51.035
MONIQUE: Need to
move, need to move.

42:51.035 --> 42:53.671
GORDON: I know,
I know, I know. Right.

42:54.238 --> 42:57.675
Coming out of the
pan in five seconds.

42:57.675 --> 43:00.578
MONIQUE: Five, four.

43:00.578 --> 43:06.417
GORDON: Hold on, my lemon.
MONIQUE: Three, two, one.

43:07.151 --> 43:08.820
(makes timer noise).

43:13.758 --> 43:16.127
GORDON: I am ready.

43:18.629 --> 43:23.434
Alongside my pan fried
paua, my goat with
fuchsia berry chutney,

43:23.434 --> 43:28.873
and with my Teriyaki glazed
eel, I'm serving a raw salad
of wild foraged herbs.

43:32.043 --> 43:36.214
To accompany her goat,
Monique's made her signature
huhu grub sauce,

43:37.081 --> 43:40.184
Maori potato flatbreads and
hangi steamed pudding.

44:05.710 --> 44:07.345
GORDON: What a day!

44:07.345 --> 44:10.581
And when you experience cooking
like that for the first time

44:10.581 --> 44:12.683
it becomes even more special,

44:12.683 --> 44:16.154
because it's special
ingredients for special people
with a special young chef.

44:16.154 --> 44:19.790
And then the uniqueness of
it, because you start with
those raw ingredients

44:19.790 --> 44:23.094
that are hand‐sourced, and then
you stick them in the ground

44:23.094 --> 44:25.796
and all of a sudden this
whole thing comes to life

44:25.796 --> 44:30.535
and you start taking in this
culture that has been a
tradition for centuries.

44:31.903 --> 44:34.872
The question is,
have I done it justice?

44:34.872 --> 44:36.941
I've never been so nervous
putting something into a hole

44:36.941 --> 44:40.011
and waiting three and a
half hours for it to cook.

44:40.011 --> 44:43.748
Because I'm a control freak.
So did I pass the test?

44:49.120 --> 44:50.888
GUESTS: Yeah. Yes.
MAN: It's very nice.

44:50.888 --> 44:53.191
ELDER: Everything's superb.

44:53.191 --> 44:56.027
The goat with this sauce on
it, that's incredible, that.

44:56.027 --> 44:58.429
And the paua was to die for.

45:04.268 --> 45:06.103
MONIQUE: Gordon
did an awesome job.

45:06.103 --> 45:08.739
He's picked up a lot in a
really short time about

45:08.739 --> 45:11.042
Maori ingredients and
Maori cooking techniques.

45:11.042 --> 45:13.744
I didn't think a Brit
would pick up our way
of doing things so fast,

45:13.744 --> 45:16.147
but he's impressed me a lot.

45:16.147 --> 45:18.316
GORDON: Spending this week
with Monique has been amazing,

45:18.316 --> 45:21.852
because in many ways she
reminds me of myself at 31.

45:22.653 --> 45:26.591
The difference between her
and I is that I was trained
in a modern European style,

45:26.591 --> 45:28.359
and she's trained
in a Maori style,

45:28.359 --> 45:31.229
and this connect together
has been a wonderful lesson.

45:32.230 --> 45:33.864
Fluff, apart from half
the food in your beard.

45:33.864 --> 45:36.234
Are you saving that for later?

45:36.234 --> 45:37.868
What was your favorite part.

45:42.807 --> 45:45.977
GORDON: If you're ever in
London, you're more than
welcome to come and join me

45:45.977 --> 45:47.311
at my restaurant for dinner.

45:47.311 --> 45:49.347
FLUFF: I definitely will.

45:51.182 --> 45:54.218
GORDON: Here in New Zealand,
I've discovered unique
ingredients.

45:54.218 --> 45:57.121
Wow! That's delicious.

45:57.121 --> 45:59.724
And learned
ingenious cooking methods.

45:59.724 --> 46:01.425
So that'll burn,
that will steam.

46:01.425 --> 46:02.860
ZANE: Yeah.

46:02.860 --> 46:05.997
GORDON: Which deserve to
rival some of the finest
food on the planet.

46:05.997 --> 46:10.801
It's almost like a sacred
cuisine, and they have every
reason to be over‐confident.

46:10.801 --> 46:13.971
But no, they take the opposite
route because, I think,

46:13.971 --> 46:17.675
deep down inside
the Maoris don't want
this secret out there.

46:18.175 --> 46:21.879
But they've inspired me,
and I'll carry this inspiration
with me wherever I go.
