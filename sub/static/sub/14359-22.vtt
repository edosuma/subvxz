WEBVTT

00:02.127 --> 00:05.881
Oh, my God.

00:02.127 --> 00:05.881
Hal, look at this.

00:05.923 --> 00:08.425
We still have a Christmas

00:05.923 --> 00:08.425
present for one of the boys.

00:08.467 --> 00:10.135
I wonder what it is.

00:10.177 --> 00:11.929
Reese ever get that

00:10.177 --> 00:11.929
football jersey?

00:11.971 --> 00:13.054
I can't remember.

00:13.096 --> 00:14.055
Well, you know, honey,

00:14.097 --> 00:15.891
the boys got so much

00:14.097 --> 00:15.891
for Christmas last year,

00:15.933 --> 00:17.893
they don't even

00:15.933 --> 00:17.893
appreciate what

00:15.933 --> 00:17.893
they have.

00:17.935 --> 00:19.060
If we save it

00:17.935 --> 00:19.060
for his birthday,

00:19.102 --> 00:20.646
it'll be that much

00:19.102 --> 00:20.646
more special.

00:20.688 --> 00:21.856
Hal, this one's for you.

00:21.897 --> 00:23.106
Oh, boy!

00:21.897 --> 00:23.106
You did get me

00:23.148 --> 00:25.526
that DVD player

00:23.148 --> 00:25.526
I've been hoping for.

00:25.567 --> 00:27.444
I thought you forgot.

00:27.486 --> 00:28.529
To be honest with you,

00:28.570 --> 00:30.113
I've been holding

00:28.570 --> 00:30.113
a grudge for months.

00:30.155 --> 00:32.908
Now I get to watch

00:30.155 --> 00:32.908
all those DVDs I've got hidden

00:32.950 --> 00:34.117
in the garage.

00:38.831 --> 00:40.582
Oh.

00:40.624 --> 00:44.503
Jumper cables.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.129

01:47.858 --> 01:49.150
a coat hanger.

01:49.192 --> 01:50.193
I did that

01:49.192 --> 01:50.193
yesterday, Dad.

01:50.235 --> 01:51.862
Trust me,

01:50.235 --> 01:51.862
don't go in there.

01:51.904 --> 01:53.697
He's done

01:51.904 --> 01:53.697
when he's done.

01:56.909 --> 01:58.159
Hey, everyone.

01:58.201 --> 01:59.661
Say good morning,

01:58.201 --> 01:59.661
Jellybean.

01:59.703 --> 02:01.162
(chuckling)

02:01.204 --> 02:02.790
(cat meows)

02:03.832 --> 02:05.834
Oh...

02:05.876 --> 02:08.837
dear Lord.

02:08.879 --> 02:11.423
We burned his house down.

02:12.674 --> 02:14.468
You know, I'm really excited

02:14.509 --> 02:16.971
about this father-son

02:14.509 --> 02:16.971
weekend at Marlin.

02:17.012 --> 02:19.598
Spend some time with Francis,

02:17.012 --> 02:19.598
do some male bonding,

02:19.640 --> 02:21.475
maybe even a survival hike.

02:21.516 --> 02:22.851
You have your fluffy pillow?

02:22.893 --> 02:24.478
Right here.

02:24.519 --> 02:26.855
I'm really going

02:24.519 --> 02:26.855
to miss you.

02:26.897 --> 02:28.107
Oh...

02:28.148 --> 02:29.066
Come with me.

02:29.108 --> 02:30.275
I can't.

02:29.108 --> 02:30.275
I'm not allowed.

02:30.317 --> 02:33.194
It's fathers and sons only.

02:33.236 --> 02:35.196
Well, I'll hide you.

02:35.238 --> 02:37.116
No one will know.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.868
You can be my dirty

02:37.157 --> 02:39.868
little secret.

02:45.248 --> 02:47.668
Now this is nice.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.252
And don't you worry

02:47.709 --> 02:49.252
about a thing, Hal.

02:49.294 --> 02:51.880
I'll take as good care of

02:49.294 --> 02:51.880
your house as you did mine.

02:51.922 --> 02:53.007
I'm just kidding.

02:53.048 --> 02:54.215
I won't burn

02:53.048 --> 02:54.215
your house down.

02:54.257 --> 02:56.677
But that's all in the past.

02:54.257 --> 02:56.677
Totally forgotten.

02:56.718 --> 02:58.887
Better get going, though.

02:56.718 --> 02:58.887
Don't want to be late.

02:58.929 --> 03:00.055
Thanks.

03:00.097 --> 03:01.056
Bye, honey.

03:01.098 --> 03:02.181
Bye.

03:05.727 --> 03:07.729
Uh, Lois,

03:07.771 --> 03:10.607
I'm aware this isn't the most

03:07.771 --> 03:10.607
comfortable situation here,

03:10.649 --> 03:12.818
having me around

03:10.649 --> 03:12.818
all the time,

03:12.860 --> 03:14.402
the forbidden fruit,

03:12.860 --> 03:14.402
as it were.

03:14.444 --> 03:15.737
Especially now,

03:14.444 --> 03:15.737
with Hal gone.

03:15.779 --> 03:17.156
Yeah, Craig,

03:15.779 --> 03:17.156
it's not...

03:15.779 --> 03:17.156
But, shh...

03:17.196 --> 03:19.491
Whatever feelings

03:17.196 --> 03:19.491
we shared...

03:19.533 --> 03:21.242
that's in the past.

03:21.284 --> 03:22.953
That part of us

03:21.284 --> 03:22.953
is dead now.

03:22.995 --> 03:24.705
Craig, I...

03:22.995 --> 03:24.705
Shh, shh, shh!

03:24.746 --> 03:27.374
(whispers):

03:24.746 --> 03:27.374
Let's not rekindle this.

03:29.793 --> 03:31.252
You know,

03:29.793 --> 03:31.252
if you're not allowed

03:31.294 --> 03:32.713
to keep a squirrel

03:31.294 --> 03:32.713
in your locker,

03:32.754 --> 03:33.964
they should put up a sign.

03:34.006 --> 03:36.383
I'm not psychic.

03:34.006 --> 03:36.383
I can't read minds.

03:38.719 --> 03:39.928
Look.

03:39.970 --> 03:41.262
No, Dewey, let's go.

03:41.304 --> 03:43.140
No, it's

03:41.304 --> 03:43.140
a minibike.

03:44.516 --> 03:46.643
Someone's just throwing it away?

03:46.685 --> 03:48.478
Man, that would be

03:46.685 --> 03:48.478
so cool to have.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.120
(screams)

04:05.162 --> 04:07.206
(cackles)

04:18.633 --> 04:19.676
Wait! Wait!

04:19.718 --> 04:20.969
Wait.

04:21.011 --> 04:22.012
You can't

04:21.011 --> 04:22.012
throw that out.

04:22.054 --> 04:23.013
This?

04:23.055 --> 04:24.014
It's a piece of trash.

04:24.056 --> 04:25.306
What are you

04:24.056 --> 04:25.306
talking about?

04:25.348 --> 04:26.767
That's not trash.

04:26.808 --> 04:28.309
You don't know

04:26.808 --> 04:28.309
what trash is.

04:28.351 --> 04:30.311
I am a garbage man.

04:30.353 --> 04:31.813
Look, why don't you

04:30.353 --> 04:31.813
give us the bike?

04:31.855 --> 04:33.356
Maybe we can fix it up

04:31.855 --> 04:33.356
or something.

04:33.398 --> 04:35.358
What's it worth to you?

04:35.400 --> 04:37.318
What? We don't

04:35.400 --> 04:37.318
have any money.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.113
You were just about

04:37.360 --> 04:39.113
to throw it away.

04:39.154 --> 04:40.321
Give you 30 bucks.

04:40.363 --> 04:42.032
Done.

04:42.074 --> 04:43.909
Where'd you

04:42.074 --> 04:43.909
get 30 bucks?

04:43.951 --> 04:45.660
What are you, a cop?

04:53.794 --> 04:55.336
Hey, Lois.

04:55.378 --> 04:58.257
Just fighting

04:55.378 --> 04:58.257
Father Time.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.758
Craig, I have to work

04:58.298 --> 04:59.758
late tonight.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.218
Would you mind

04:59.800 --> 05:01.218
feeding the boys?

05:01.260 --> 05:02.261
No problem.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.220
Thanks.

05:03.262 --> 05:04.805
So, uh, I'm in charge, then?

05:04.846 --> 05:07.432
All you have to do

05:04.846 --> 05:07.432
is fix them some dinner.

05:04.846 --> 05:07.432
Right.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.184
But I'm completely in charge.

05:09.226 --> 05:10.936
They got to

05:09.226 --> 05:10.936
listen to me.

05:10.978 --> 05:11.979
Dance for me.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.355
That's right, dance.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.355
Why?

05:14.397 --> 05:16.984
'Cause I'm in charge,

05:14.397 --> 05:16.984
that's why.

05:17.025 --> 05:19.486
We burned his house down.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.363
Look at it.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.363
It was just dirty.

05:22.405 --> 05:23.782
The paint job's perfect.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.076
And all it needs is a spark plug

05:23.824 --> 05:26.076
and a carburetor

05:26.118 --> 05:27.244
and it'll be working.

05:27.286 --> 05:28.996
We can get that stuff

05:27.286 --> 05:28.996
off Dad's lawnmower.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.413
This minibike

05:29.037 --> 05:30.413
is the coolest thing

05:30.455 --> 05:31.539
we've ever had in our lives.

05:31.581 --> 05:34.209
This totally makes up

05:31.581 --> 05:34.209
for all the years of crap.

05:34.251 --> 05:36.295
This is the only thing

05:34.251 --> 05:36.295
we've ever shared.

05:36.335 --> 05:38.213
This is the only thing we've

05:36.335 --> 05:38.213
had that's worth sharing.

05:38.255 --> 05:39.422
The first thing

05:38.255 --> 05:39.422
I'm gonna do

05:39.464 --> 05:41.382
is go down to Principal

05:39.464 --> 05:41.382
Littledove's house

05:41.424 --> 05:42.676
and cut donuts

05:41.424 --> 05:42.676
on his front lawn.

05:42.717 --> 05:44.845
Okay, why don't you take it

05:42.717 --> 05:44.845
tomorrow and Wednesday

05:44.886 --> 05:46.763
and I'll take it on...

05:44.886 --> 05:46.763
Excuse me?

05:46.805 --> 05:48.389
What?

05:46.805 --> 05:48.389
What are you doing?

05:48.431 --> 05:50.391
Nothing, I'm just

05:48.431 --> 05:50.391
making up a schedule.

05:50.433 --> 05:52.393
Why do  you  get to

05:50.433 --> 05:52.393
make up the schedule?

05:52.435 --> 05:53.394
What's the problem?

05:53.436 --> 05:54.479
I'm giving you

05:53.436 --> 05:54.479
the first day.

05:54.521 --> 05:55.647
So what?

05:55.689 --> 05:57.191
You're not the boss

05:55.689 --> 05:57.191
of everyone.

05:57.232 --> 05:59.567
Look, I'm the one

05:57.232 --> 05:59.567
who put together the engine.

05:59.609 --> 06:01.069
Well, I'm the one

05:59.609 --> 06:01.069
that paid for it.

06:01.111 --> 06:03.404
You wouldn't even have it

06:01.111 --> 06:03.404
if I didn't see it.

06:03.446 --> 06:04.405
Shut up, Dewey.

06:04.447 --> 06:05.406
You shut up!

06:05.448 --> 06:06.658
Look, it's not

06:05.448 --> 06:06.658
even fixed yet.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.076
There's no point

06:06.700 --> 06:08.076
in fighting...

06:08.118 --> 06:09.119
I get it on Sundays!

06:09.161 --> 06:10.078
You do not!

06:10.120 --> 06:12.039
Dewey, you're too short

06:10.120 --> 06:12.039
to even ride it.

06:12.080 --> 06:15.458
I'm in the 40th percentile.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.460
And you're too stupid

06:15.500 --> 06:17.460
to ride it.

06:17.502 --> 06:18.503
Would you guys chill out?

06:18.545 --> 06:19.629
Shut up!

06:18.545 --> 06:19.629
Yeah, Malcolm!

06:19.671 --> 06:21.215
You may be able

06:19.671 --> 06:21.215
to boss around

06:21.256 --> 06:22.423
your loser Krelboynes,

06:22.465 --> 06:25.344
but normal people don't

06:22.465 --> 06:25.344
have to listen to you.

06:25.384 --> 06:28.096
Quit talking and hit him.

06:28.138 --> 06:30.389
You don't have

06:28.138 --> 06:30.389
any friends.

06:32.475 --> 06:35.854
Mom told you you're never

06:32.475 --> 06:35.854
allowed to talk about that.

06:35.896 --> 06:39.398
(playing  Three's Company

06:35.896 --> 06:39.398
theme song)

06:45.530 --> 06:46.907
Let's have a hand

06:46.948 --> 06:48.700
for Cadet Drew

06:46.948 --> 06:48.700
and his father,

06:48.742 --> 06:51.536
direct from the showrooms

06:51.578 --> 06:53.454
of Atlantic City.

06:53.496 --> 06:56.958
That was just riveting.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.461
And, now, we have a few more

06:57.000 --> 07:00.461
awards to give out.

07:00.503 --> 07:01.922
(all groaning)

07:00.503 --> 07:01.922
Now, now,

07:01.963 --> 07:06.467
we have a lot of students, and

07:01.963 --> 07:06.467
they all deserve recognition.

07:08.511 --> 07:11.390
The award for

07:08.511 --> 07:11.390
the best history essay

07:11.431 --> 07:14.309
by a junior or sophomore

07:11.431 --> 07:14.309
goes to...

07:14.351 --> 07:15.727
Cadet Eric.

07:20.565 --> 07:22.109
Congratulations.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.068
Thanks.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.569
We're so proud

07:23.110 --> 07:24.569
of our Eric.

07:24.611 --> 07:27.447
We're the luckiest

07:24.611 --> 07:27.447
dads in the world.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.533
It  was  a great essay.

07:30.575 --> 07:33.536
I had a shot at the "C"

07:30.575 --> 07:33.536
till he screwed up

07:30.575 --> 07:33.536
the curve.

07:33.578 --> 07:36.373
They sure are giving out

07:33.578 --> 07:36.373
a lot of awards, huh?

07:36.415 --> 07:38.499
Yeah, I'm sorry.

07:36.415 --> 07:38.499
This is just ridiculous.

07:38.541 --> 07:40.168
He gives these

07:38.541 --> 07:40.168
things out like candy.

07:40.210 --> 07:41.502
And now

07:41.544 --> 07:43.338
the award for the cadet

07:43.380 --> 07:46.007
who has shown

07:43.380 --> 07:46.007
the most improvement.

07:46.049 --> 07:50.511
This young lad came to Marlin

07:46.049 --> 07:50.511
as a delinquent jack-a-ninny

07:50.553 --> 07:53.140
without the slightest

07:50.553 --> 07:53.140
sign of potential.

07:53.181 --> 07:55.976
And yet, in a mere

07:53.181 --> 07:55.976
year and a half,

07:56.017 --> 07:57.936
he has started

07:57.978 --> 07:59.813
to turn himself around.

07:59.854 --> 08:02.523
He's not all the way there yet,

08:02.565 --> 08:05.402
but he is on the path

08:02.565 --> 08:05.402
to becoming

08:05.444 --> 08:08.780
an outstanding member

08:05.444 --> 08:08.780
of the Marlin family.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.991
I proudly present...

08:11.032 --> 08:13.534
Cadet Gordie.

08:13.576 --> 08:16.163
(applause)

08:24.587 --> 08:26.631
This is nice, you know?

08:26.673 --> 08:30.635
Sitting around with family,

08:26.673 --> 08:30.635
eating together, sharing.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.553
What'd you do today, buddy?

08:32.595 --> 08:35.056
Nothing. I'm too short.

08:35.098 --> 08:36.724
I wouldn't worry about that,

08:35.098 --> 08:36.724
sport.

08:36.766 --> 08:38.559
I bet you probably have

08:36.766 --> 08:38.559
the biggest head

08:38.601 --> 08:39.644
in your whole class.

08:39.686 --> 08:42.063
Am I too stupid

08:39.686 --> 08:42.063
to have some more peas?

08:42.105 --> 08:45.400
I don't think there are

08:42.105 --> 08:45.400
any rules on that, Chief.

08:48.778 --> 08:51.072
Yeah, this is nice.

08:51.114 --> 08:55.494
I remember when I was your age,

08:51.114 --> 08:55.494
not a care in the world.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.245
Me and my imaginary brother

08:57.287 --> 09:00.581
outside in the yard

08:57.287 --> 09:00.581
building forts all day.

09:00.623 --> 09:02.583
Yep, good times.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.585
Where do you think you're going?

09:04.627 --> 09:05.879
To the garage!

09:05.920 --> 09:07.381
Not alone, you're not!

09:07.422 --> 09:09.590
I'm coming, too!

09:09.632 --> 09:13.011
You're all excused.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.762
Kids.

09:14.804 --> 09:15.847
Hey, genius,

09:15.889 --> 09:17.598
you going to be done

09:15.889 --> 09:17.598
any time this year?

09:17.640 --> 09:20.310
If you'd just shut up and left

09:17.640 --> 09:20.310
me alone, it'd be fixed by now.

09:20.352 --> 09:22.479
You two disgust me.

09:22.521 --> 09:24.898
All right, this should do it.

09:24.939 --> 09:26.233
Let me do it.

09:26.274 --> 09:28.818
I'm doing it.

09:26.274 --> 09:28.818
Me, me, me, me!

09:28.860 --> 09:30.611
(engine running)

09:28.860 --> 09:30.611
I told you I could fix it.

09:30.653 --> 09:32.406
Way to go, jackass.

09:30.653 --> 09:32.406
Now get out of my way.

09:32.447 --> 09:33.698
Get off!

09:32.447 --> 09:33.698
It's mine!

09:32.447 --> 09:33.698
No!

09:34.866 --> 09:36.076
It's mine!

09:34.866 --> 09:36.076
Get off!

09:36.117 --> 09:38.245
It's mine!

09:36.117 --> 09:38.245
Mine!

09:36.117 --> 09:38.245
Move!

09:38.286 --> 09:39.246
I found it

09:38.286 --> 09:39.246
and I fixed it!

09:39.287 --> 09:40.414
It's mine!

09:39.287 --> 09:40.414
Leave it alone!

09:40.455 --> 09:41.622
It's mine!

09:41.664 --> 09:42.832
LOIS:

09:41.664 --> 09:42.832
It's nobody's!

09:44.334 --> 09:45.626
What's wrong with you kids?

09:45.668 --> 09:47.587
You're not allowed

09:45.668 --> 09:47.587
to have a motorcycle.

09:53.718 --> 09:56.137
What are you doing?

09:53.718 --> 09:56.137
Yeah, that's ours!

09:56.179 --> 09:57.638
We paid for it

09:56.179 --> 09:57.638
with our own money!

09:57.680 --> 09:59.640
Well, that was pretty

09:57.680 --> 09:59.640
stupid of you, wasn't it?

09:59.682 --> 10:02.352
There's no way

09:59.682 --> 10:02.352
you're having a motorcycle.

10:02.394 --> 10:05.146
But, Mom, it's

10:02.394 --> 10:05.146
not a motorcycle.

10:05.188 --> 10:06.565
It's just

10:05.188 --> 10:06.565
a little minibike.

10:06.606 --> 10:07.648
It's a motorcycle.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.067
It's  not  a motorcycle!

10:09.109 --> 10:10.277
It's two feet high.

10:10.318 --> 10:11.819
It was made

10:10.318 --> 10:11.819
specifically for kids.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.780
Two wheels. Motor.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.780
Motorcycle.

10:15.698 --> 10:20.370
Look, I... I understand

10:15.698 --> 10:20.370
that, uh, Francis

10:20.412 --> 10:22.872
is never going to be

10:20.412 --> 10:22.872
the perfect kid.

10:22.914 --> 10:25.750
You see,

10:22.914 --> 10:25.750
what I'm asking for here

10:25.792 --> 10:29.504
is, is just a little...

10:25.792 --> 10:29.504
ray of hope.

10:31.089 --> 10:33.633
Anything at all?

10:36.386 --> 10:38.221
Francis is...

10:39.722 --> 10:43.643
...not interested in learning.

10:44.936 --> 10:47.981
Francis is...

10:48.022 --> 10:49.690
interested in causing trouble.

10:49.732 --> 10:53.694
I'm sorry to have to say that,

10:49.732 --> 10:53.694
but I have seen his type before.

10:53.736 --> 10:55.071
All he likes to do

10:55.113 --> 10:57.574
is flout authority.

10:57.616 --> 10:59.576
He has contempt for rules.

10:59.618 --> 11:02.162
He lives to undermine

10:59.618 --> 11:02.162
and destroy.

11:02.203 --> 11:03.538
He feels

11:02.203 --> 11:03.538
no compunction...

11:03.580 --> 11:04.623
Okay.

11:04.664 --> 11:08.585
I get it.

11:08.627 --> 11:11.671
Isn't there anything

11:08.627 --> 11:11.671
positive you can tell me?

11:12.755 --> 11:15.008
Sorry.

11:18.677 --> 11:19.720
Oh, wait.

11:19.762 --> 11:20.721
Yes?

11:20.763 --> 11:24.225
Do you want chicken

11:20.763 --> 11:24.225
or fish tonight?

11:27.770 --> 11:29.772
Look, Mom,

11:27.770 --> 11:29.772
I don't think you realize

11:29.814 --> 11:31.566
how much we really want

11:29.814 --> 11:31.566
this bike.

11:31.608 --> 11:34.735
I looked over your tax return,

11:31.608 --> 11:34.735
and I think I could save you

11:34.777 --> 11:36.737
about $1,200...

11:36.779 --> 11:38.532
if  you make it

11:36.779 --> 11:38.532
worth my while.

11:38.573 --> 11:39.698
No.

11:42.076 --> 11:44.745
You know that dog

11:42.076 --> 11:44.745
that keeps you up every night?

11:44.787 --> 11:47.748
I could take him

11:44.787 --> 11:47.748
for a little... "walk."

11:47.790 --> 11:49.459
No!

11:49.501 --> 11:50.751
I want it! I want it!

11:50.793 --> 11:52.212
I hate you! I want it!

11:52.253 --> 11:53.754
I wish I was dead!

11:53.796 --> 11:55.756
(shrieking)

11:55.798 --> 11:58.759
Detailed information

11:55.798 --> 11:58.759
on every unsolved breakage

11:58.801 --> 12:01.762
or disappearance in this house

11:58.801 --> 12:01.762
for the last two years.

12:01.804 --> 12:03.764
No!

12:03.806 --> 12:06.142
Doing laundry, huh?

12:06.184 --> 12:07.477
Yes, Craig.

12:07.519 --> 12:09.604
Well, don't even think

12:07.519 --> 12:09.604
of doing my stuff.

12:09.646 --> 12:11.856
I'm the only guy

12:09.646 --> 12:11.856
that handles my used underpants,

12:11.898 --> 12:13.774
thank you very much.

12:13.816 --> 12:16.069
Of course, shame

12:13.816 --> 12:16.069
to waste electricity

12:16.110 --> 12:18.613
if you got the room.

12:20.739 --> 12:22.783
Okay, Mom,

12:20.739 --> 12:22.783
we thought about it

12:22.825 --> 12:23.784
and we understand

12:23.826 --> 12:25.953
that you're worried

12:23.826 --> 12:25.953
about us getting hurt,

12:25.995 --> 12:27.664
so we promise we'll

12:25.995 --> 12:27.664
always wear helmets

12:27.706 --> 12:28.789
when we ride the minibike.

12:28.831 --> 12:29.832
And in addition to the helmets,

12:29.874 --> 12:31.376
we'll also wear

12:29.874 --> 12:31.376
elbow and knee pads

12:31.418 --> 12:32.627
no matter how dorky we look.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.879
And we'll only ride it

12:32.669 --> 12:34.879
in the park.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.590
And only under

12:34.921 --> 12:36.590
your supervision

12:36.631 --> 12:39.008
when you say so and

12:36.631 --> 12:39.008
when you're with us.

12:39.050 --> 12:39.884
No.

12:39.926 --> 12:40.801
Wait!

12:40.843 --> 12:41.678
No!

12:41.720 --> 12:42.803
This isn't fair!

12:42.845 --> 12:44.305
You don't get

12:42.845 --> 12:44.305
to just say no!

12:44.347 --> 12:45.806
Yes, I do.

12:44.347 --> 12:45.806
No, you don't!

12:45.848 --> 12:47.808
You can't just make

12:45.848 --> 12:47.808
a blanket statement

12:47.850 --> 12:49.477
that covers

12:47.850 --> 12:49.477
everything.

12:49.519 --> 12:50.811
There has to be some scenario

12:50.853 --> 12:52.855
where you'll let us

12:50.853 --> 12:52.855
ride the bike.

12:52.897 --> 12:54.815
I mean, what if I was

12:52.897 --> 12:54.815
a trained athlete

12:54.857 --> 12:56.817
who practiced on a simulator

12:54.857 --> 12:56.817
for 15 years

12:56.859 --> 12:59.820
and wore Kevlar body armor

12:56.859 --> 12:59.820
in a field of marshmallows?

12:59.862 --> 13:00.821
I would still say no.

13:00.863 --> 13:01.989
Now stop bothering me.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.116
I don't know, Lois.

13:03.157 --> 13:04.825
The boys sound

13:03.157 --> 13:04.825
pretty reasonable to me.

13:04.867 --> 13:06.119
Stay out of this, Craig.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.079
Hey! I live here, too, don't I?

13:08.121 --> 13:09.872
Sorry, baby.

13:09.914 --> 13:12.041
Mom's just doing this

13:09.914 --> 13:12.041
'cause she can't stand

13:12.083 --> 13:13.918
that we were

13:12.083 --> 13:13.918
actually working together.

13:13.960 --> 13:17.088
I know. Fixing that

13:13.960 --> 13:17.088
bike up was the best

13:13.960 --> 13:17.088
time we ever had.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.632
I never wanted it to end.

13:18.673 --> 13:21.217
Yeah. We were

13:18.673 --> 13:21.217
a perfect team.

13:21.259 --> 13:22.469
We still are.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.679
The three of us,

13:22.510 --> 13:24.679
we're going to work together

13:24.721 --> 13:25.846
and find a way to beat her.

13:25.888 --> 13:27.848
She's going down.

13:27.890 --> 13:31.102
Hey... wait a minute.

13:35.398 --> 13:39.860
Boys! I need some help!

13:39.902 --> 13:41.070
Oh.

13:41.112 --> 13:42.947
What's this?

13:43.990 --> 13:45.950
Looks like a picture

13:43.990 --> 13:45.950
of you on a horse.

13:45.992 --> 13:47.826
What were you,

13:45.992 --> 13:47.826
about Dewey's age?

13:50.913 --> 13:52.499
What are you doing with this?

13:52.540 --> 13:54.584
This looks

13:52.540 --> 13:54.584
awfully  dangerous.

13:54.626 --> 13:55.876
Look at that.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.712
No padding, no helmet.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.255
Did you ever fall?

13:59.297 --> 14:00.757
What does this

13:59.297 --> 14:00.757
have to do with...?

14:00.799 --> 14:03.176
We're asking the questions.

14:03.217 --> 14:04.385
MALCOLM:

14:03.217 --> 14:04.385
So, according

14:04.427 --> 14:05.679
to your logic,

14:05.720 --> 14:07.096
a two-foot fall

14:05.720 --> 14:07.096
from a minibike

14:07.138 --> 14:09.140
is more dangerous

14:07.138 --> 14:09.140
than a six-foot fall

14:09.182 --> 14:10.475
from a galloping horse?

14:10.517 --> 14:12.893
That was a long time ago.

14:12.935 --> 14:15.730
Before gravity?

14:15.772 --> 14:17.898
I don't have time for this

14:15.772 --> 14:17.898
right now.

14:17.940 --> 14:19.484
I have to get ready...

14:19.526 --> 14:22.737
I have to go to work.

14:22.779 --> 14:23.904
Did you see that?

14:23.946 --> 14:25.573
We totally rattled her!

14:23.946 --> 14:25.573
Yeah!

14:25.615 --> 14:26.741
We did it!

14:26.783 --> 14:27.908
It worked!

14:27.950 --> 14:28.909
We've got Mom!

14:28.951 --> 14:29.952
What?

14:29.994 --> 14:31.204
There's a chink in the armor!

14:31.245 --> 14:32.372
We're going to do it!

14:32.413 --> 14:34.290
If we just play it cool,

14:32.413 --> 14:34.290
have a little patience,

14:34.332 --> 14:36.167
we'll have the minibike

14:34.332 --> 14:36.167
by the end of the week!

14:36.209 --> 14:37.126
No, we won't.

14:37.168 --> 14:38.211
It's broken.

14:38.252 --> 14:39.754
What?

14:39.796 --> 14:41.422
I snuck it out

14:39.796 --> 14:41.422
for a ride.

14:41.464 --> 14:42.923
And you know what?

14:42.965 --> 14:44.342
They  are  dangerous.

14:48.012 --> 14:50.223
You think Mom will notice?

14:55.978 --> 14:58.939
You moron! Do you have any idea

14:55.978 --> 14:58.939
what you've done?

14:58.981 --> 15:00.525
We were  so  close!

14:58.981 --> 15:00.525
We had her!

15:00.567 --> 15:01.735
That's what I figured.

15:01.776 --> 15:03.152
I wouldn't have taken it

15:01.776 --> 15:03.152
otherwise.

15:03.194 --> 15:04.237
I'm not an idiot.

15:04.278 --> 15:06.740
I can't believe you would...

15:06.781 --> 15:07.948
How was it?

15:07.990 --> 15:08.949
It was awesome.

15:08.991 --> 15:10.243
I looked really cool doing it.

15:10.284 --> 15:12.370
I could see my reflection

15:10.284 --> 15:12.370
in the car windows

15:12.412 --> 15:13.954
right up until I hit

15:12.412 --> 15:13.954
the mailbox.

15:13.996 --> 15:17.584
Sometimes you just

15:13.996 --> 15:17.584
embarrass me.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.960
It's okay.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.960
Mom doesn't have to find out.

15:20.002 --> 15:21.337
I'll be fine.

15:21.379 --> 15:22.797
My leg's really

15:21.379 --> 15:22.797
starting to feel better.

15:22.839 --> 15:25.550
Let's see it.

15:22.839 --> 15:25.550
Ow!

15:25.592 --> 15:27.427
(knock on door)

15:25.592 --> 15:27.427
Hi, Mom!

15:25.592 --> 15:27.427
Hello.

15:27.468 --> 15:29.053
Look, boys,

15:27.468 --> 15:29.053
I was thinking about it,

15:29.095 --> 15:31.806
and, uh, you're old enough

15:29.095 --> 15:31.806
to deserve an explanation.

15:31.848 --> 15:32.973
I was...

15:33.015 --> 15:34.851
You don't always know

15:33.015 --> 15:34.851
what's best for us!

15:34.893 --> 15:36.686
You don't know

15:34.893 --> 15:36.686
that we would have gotten hurt!

15:36.728 --> 15:37.978
There's such a thing as trust!

15:38.020 --> 15:39.355
I  really  think we've earned it!

15:39.397 --> 15:41.566
Reese, I'm not saying

15:39.397 --> 15:41.566
that I...

15:39.397 --> 15:41.566
I don't have

15:41.608 --> 15:42.983
to sit here and listen to this!

15:43.025 --> 15:44.611
Yes, you do.

15:43.025 --> 15:44.611
Oh, right.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.362
Look, I'll tell you what.

15:46.404 --> 15:47.988
How about I take you to the

15:46.404 --> 15:47.988
skateboard park tonight, huh?

15:48.030 --> 15:49.240
How does that sound?

15:49.282 --> 15:51.785
Actually, I'm

15:49.282 --> 15:51.785
pretty tired.

15:51.826 --> 15:54.287
Me, too, and I think

15:51.826 --> 15:54.287
I really want to get a jump

15:54.328 --> 15:55.789
on next week's homework.

15:55.830 --> 15:57.998
What's going on?

15:58.040 --> 15:58.999
You guys are...

15:59.041 --> 16:00.585
CRAIG:

15:59.041 --> 16:00.585
Lois! Lois!

16:00.627 --> 16:02.587
Oh, for God's sake!

16:02.629 --> 16:04.213
What is it now?

16:04.255 --> 16:06.716
What's the matter, Craig?

16:06.758 --> 16:09.427
What does it say

16:06.758 --> 16:09.427
on this jar?

16:09.469 --> 16:10.887
"Craig."

16:10.929 --> 16:13.013
Well, I'm glad someone

16:10.929 --> 16:13.013
around here can read.

16:13.055 --> 16:15.015
These jars come

16:13.055 --> 16:15.015
with 14 pickles in them.

16:15.057 --> 16:17.017
I had three yesterday,

16:15.057 --> 16:17.017
two for lunch today

16:17.059 --> 16:18.686
and one-and-a-half

16:17.059 --> 16:18.686
for a snack,

16:18.728 --> 16:22.064
and now there are six-and-a-half

16:18.728 --> 16:22.064
pickles in this jar!

16:22.106 --> 16:23.441
Simple math indicates...

16:23.483 --> 16:25.318
Are you counting the one

16:23.483 --> 16:25.318
in your hand?

16:27.069 --> 16:28.863
Okay, false alarm.

16:30.865 --> 16:33.576
We burned his house down.

16:38.790 --> 16:41.417
Oh,  this  is the guy.

16:41.459 --> 16:42.418
This  is Francis.

16:42.460 --> 16:43.837
What I want to know is,

16:43.878 --> 16:45.045
how did you get the cow

16:45.087 --> 16:46.673
onto the roof

16:45.087 --> 16:46.673
of the gymnasium

16:46.714 --> 16:47.882
in the first place?

16:47.924 --> 16:48.883
Ah, that was easy.

16:48.925 --> 16:50.259
The parachute was the problem.

16:50.301 --> 16:51.719
Did you know

16:50.301 --> 16:51.719
those things don't open

16:51.761 --> 16:53.763
unless you're thousands of feet

16:51.761 --> 16:53.763
in the air?

16:53.805 --> 16:55.473
You live, you learn.

16:55.515 --> 16:56.891
Did I ever tell you about that?

16:56.933 --> 16:58.225
No.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.895
Look at this: archery,

16:58.267 --> 17:00.895
debating, field hockey...

17:00.937 --> 17:02.730
Look at all these

17:00.937 --> 17:02.730
clubs and teams,

17:02.772 --> 17:04.273
and you're not

17:02.772 --> 17:04.273
in any of them.

17:04.315 --> 17:07.067
There isn't even

17:04.315 --> 17:07.067
a picture of you

17:04.315 --> 17:07.067
in the yearbook.

17:07.109 --> 17:09.069
Look under Pete Zahut.

17:09.111 --> 17:11.447
I don't want to look

17:09.111 --> 17:11.447
under Pete Zahut.

17:11.489 --> 17:13.073
No, no, no, if you say it

17:11.489 --> 17:13.073
fast, it sounds like...

17:13.115 --> 17:14.158
I don't believe this.

17:14.200 --> 17:17.286
Francis... don't you

17:14.200 --> 17:17.286
care about anything?

17:17.328 --> 17:18.329
What?

17:18.371 --> 17:20.581
In a school filled

17:18.371 --> 17:20.581
with problem children,

17:20.623 --> 17:22.917
you're the worst one here.

17:25.127 --> 17:26.086
Wait, that's not true.

17:26.128 --> 17:27.714
I can think of

17:26.128 --> 17:27.714
three other guys

17:27.755 --> 17:29.173
with longer records

17:27.755 --> 17:29.173
than I have.

17:29.215 --> 17:30.925
We have worked

17:29.215 --> 17:30.925
and we've worked,

17:30.967 --> 17:33.177
trying anything we can think of

17:30.967 --> 17:33.177
to turn you around,

17:33.219 --> 17:35.179
but nothing seems

17:33.219 --> 17:35.179
to get through to you.

17:35.221 --> 17:37.097
Come on, Dad.

17:37.139 --> 17:39.767
No. You don't give a damn

17:37.139 --> 17:39.767
about anything but yourself!

17:39.809 --> 17:42.102
And, Francis, I don't like

17:39.809 --> 17:42.102
saying these things,

17:42.144 --> 17:43.604
but what am I supposed to do?

17:43.646 --> 17:46.024
I-I feel like I have

17:43.646 --> 17:46.024
to give up on my own son.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.107
Dad...

17:47.149 --> 17:50.444
You know, I can't even

17:47.149 --> 17:50.444
look at you right now.

17:52.154 --> 17:55.033
I don't remember

17:52.154 --> 17:55.033
if we're hating each other

17:55.074 --> 17:57.201
or liking each other,

17:55.074 --> 17:57.201
but either way

17:57.243 --> 17:58.494
I appreciate this.

17:58.536 --> 18:00.120
Ah, it's been

17:58.536 --> 18:00.120
two hours, Reese.

18:00.162 --> 18:01.831
The swelling

18:00.162 --> 18:01.831
isn't going down.

18:01.873 --> 18:03.583
Look, you can see

18:01.873 --> 18:03.583
his heartbeat.

18:03.624 --> 18:06.293
Oh, man. We really

18:03.624 --> 18:06.293
need to get you

18:03.624 --> 18:06.293
to the hospital.

18:06.335 --> 18:09.129
We can't! Mom will kill us

18:06.335 --> 18:09.129
if she finds out about the bike.

18:09.171 --> 18:10.548
This isn't about the bike!

18:10.590 --> 18:12.425
We're screwed

18:10.590 --> 18:12.425
for the next five years

18:12.466 --> 18:13.634
on anything we'd like to do.

18:13.676 --> 18:15.135
(ice clatters)

18:15.177 --> 18:17.555
There's got to be some way

18:15.177 --> 18:17.555
we can get you to the hospital

18:17.597 --> 18:18.806
before she finds out.

18:18.848 --> 18:20.391
Then we could come up

18:18.848 --> 18:20.391
with a cover story.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.309
Could you handle that?

18:20.433 --> 18:22.309
Because I'm going to scream

18:22.351 --> 18:24.144
into my pillow

18:22.351 --> 18:24.144
for the next five minutes.

18:24.186 --> 18:27.648
There's got to be some way

18:24.186 --> 18:27.648
we can do this.

18:27.690 --> 18:29.483
Have you seen

18:27.690 --> 18:29.483
Jellybean's sweater?

18:31.652 --> 18:33.988
I don't know why we have to go

18:31.652 --> 18:33.988
all the way across town.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.155
Seems kind of silly.

18:35.197 --> 18:38.158
Craig, I promise,

18:35.197 --> 18:38.158
it's the best ice cream in town.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.160
Yeah, well, I'll be

18:38.200 --> 18:40.160
the judge of that.

18:41.203 --> 18:42.246
(thud)

18:42.288 --> 18:43.456
What was that?

18:43.497 --> 18:45.666
REESE:

18:43.497 --> 18:45.666
Ow!

18:45.708 --> 18:46.876
Ow, my leg!

18:46.918 --> 18:49.169
Ow. Ow.

18:49.211 --> 18:51.547
Ow! Ow! Ow!

18:51.589 --> 18:53.173
Ow!

18:53.215 --> 18:55.175
Oh, my God! What did

18:53.215 --> 18:55.175
I do? What did I do?

18:55.217 --> 18:56.343
You ran over his leg!

18:56.385 --> 18:57.887
(screaming continues)

18:57.929 --> 18:59.097
What happened?

18:59.138 --> 19:01.181
Oh, my God! Reese!

19:01.223 --> 19:02.391
Ow!

19:02.433 --> 19:04.143
Ow!

19:06.228 --> 19:09.690
Oh, for God's sakes, Jonathan,

19:06.228 --> 19:09.690
pull yourself together.

19:09.732 --> 19:11.818
He'll be home

19:09.732 --> 19:11.818
for your birthday.

19:13.235 --> 19:15.404
You got a problem?

19:22.912 --> 19:24.580
An untucked

19:24.622 --> 19:25.665
shirttail, Cadet?

19:25.706 --> 19:27.667
Is that what we teach you here?

19:27.708 --> 19:29.209
To disgrace your uniform?

19:29.251 --> 19:31.211
I think not.

19:31.253 --> 19:32.296
Sir, his shirt

19:31.253 --> 19:32.296
just came untucked

19:32.338 --> 19:34.214
when he was hugging

19:32.338 --> 19:34.214
his father.

19:34.256 --> 19:35.215
You can't

19:34.256 --> 19:35.215
yell at him

19:35.257 --> 19:36.300
for hugging his father.

19:36.342 --> 19:37.885
Francis...

19:36.342 --> 19:37.885
No.

19:37.927 --> 19:40.096
No, I'm glad you saw this.

19:40.138 --> 19:42.222
This is exactly

19:40.138 --> 19:42.222
what I was talking about.

19:42.264 --> 19:45.143
Always undermining my authority.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.812
Day in, day out,

19:45.184 --> 19:47.812
it's the same thing.

19:47.854 --> 19:51.607
Like when I had Cadet Dooley

19:47.854 --> 19:51.607
run 600 laps of the perimeter

19:51.649 --> 19:54.234
for an inside-out

19:51.649 --> 19:54.234
pillowcase violation,

19:54.276 --> 19:56.445
Francis organizes

19:54.276 --> 19:56.445
a sit-in.

19:56.487 --> 19:58.280
Or when I cut off

19:56.487 --> 19:58.280
the electricity

19:58.322 --> 20:01.241
to the fifth floor

19:58.322 --> 20:01.241
for a contraband boom box,

20:01.283 --> 20:02.493
he hijacks a generator

20:02.535 --> 20:04.120
for them.

20:04.162 --> 20:07.247
The boy lives to cause chaos.

20:07.289 --> 20:09.042
He was hugging his dad!

20:09.083 --> 20:10.877
In front of his own father,

20:10.918 --> 20:13.253
he still defies me

20:10.918 --> 20:13.253
at every turn.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.173
And every time something

20:13.295 --> 20:15.173
like that happens,

20:15.214 --> 20:16.256
he challenges you?

20:16.298 --> 20:17.424
Every time.

20:17.466 --> 20:19.426
Even when he knows

20:17.466 --> 20:19.426
he'll get in trouble?

20:19.468 --> 20:22.221
That doesn't seem

20:19.468 --> 20:22.221
to matter to him at all.

20:24.473 --> 20:26.142
I understand.

20:26.184 --> 20:30.354
I will deal with you later.

20:30.396 --> 20:32.190
Look, Dad,

20:30.396 --> 20:32.190
I just want to...

20:32.272 --> 20:34.108
Shut up, son.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.361
Oh, come here.

20:37.403 --> 20:38.612
(laughing)

20:42.324 --> 20:44.284
I can't believe

20:42.324 --> 20:44.284
that plan actually worked.

20:44.326 --> 20:46.495
We came up with it

20:44.326 --> 20:46.495
in, like, two seconds.

20:46.537 --> 20:48.664
Maybe we should do

20:46.537 --> 20:48.664
more things half-assed.

20:48.706 --> 20:50.166
Hey, Reese,

20:48.706 --> 20:50.166
how's your leg?

20:50.208 --> 20:51.291
Not bad.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.211
The pain goes away

20:51.333 --> 20:53.211
when I black out.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.503
You guys want anything to drink?

20:54.545 --> 20:55.713
Sure.

20:54.545 --> 20:55.713
Great.

20:54.545 --> 20:55.713
All right.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.006
One more thing.

20:58.174 --> 20:59.717
Did you really think

20:58.174 --> 20:59.717
I wouldn't notice

20:59.759 --> 21:03.262
a busted up minibike

20:59.759 --> 21:03.262
half-buried in the sandbox?

21:05.223 --> 21:06.933
Jellybean and I

21:05.223 --> 21:06.933
are leaving now.

21:06.974 --> 21:08.308
Once again, I'm very sorry.

21:08.350 --> 21:10.728
I can't even look you people

21:08.350 --> 21:10.728
in the eye.

21:13.355 --> 21:17.610
I think we'll call this one

21:13.355 --> 21:17.610
a wash.

21:24.075 --> 21:25.325
I love you, Francis.

21:25.367 --> 21:26.744
Good-bye.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.287
Love you, too, Dad.
