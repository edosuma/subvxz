00:00.273 --> 00:01.605
Previously on “Criminal Minds”...

00:01.607 --> 00:04.275
It wasn't Scratch who framed me.

00:04.275 --> 00:05.356
It was a woman.

00:05.356 --> 00:07.724
If you compare the partial prints

00:07.724 --> 00:10.181
found at the scene to Lindsey's,
it proves she did this.

00:11.379 --> 00:13.746
We're taking you home.

00:13.748 --> 00:15.648
Ta-da.

00:15.650 --> 00:17.249
We have to deal with Cat Adams again?

00:17.251 --> 00:20.686
Cat and Lindsey were behind
the murder of Nadie Ramos.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.287
She's been nursing
a grudge for a long time

00:22.289 --> 00:24.890
and setting up Reid, now
kidnapping his mother.

00:24.892 --> 00:27.226
Now, if the good doctor
wants his mommy back,

00:27.228 --> 00:30.896
send him to me.
He knows where to find me.

00:30.898 --> 00:32.497
After all, he put me here.

00:32.500 --> 00:37.002
But then again, I kind of
returned the favor, didn't I?

00:37.004 --> 00:40.072
He and I have unfinished business.

00:43.911 --> 00:45.244
Spencie.

00:45.246 --> 00:47.646
Where's my mother?

00:47.648 --> 00:49.014
I missed you.

00:49.016 --> 00:50.115
What did you and Lindsey do to her?

00:50.117 --> 00:51.116
How did you...

00:51.118 --> 00:52.317
Now stop.

00:52.319 --> 00:53.786
You don't get to walk in here

00:53.788 --> 00:55.688
and hiss at me like I'm the criminal.

00:55.690 --> 00:59.759
Now, we do this my way.

01:03.264 --> 01:04.730
Have a seat.

01:07.868 --> 01:10.803
How was prison? Did you like it?

01:10.805 --> 01:12.237
No.

01:12.239 --> 01:13.505
It's not fun, is it?

01:13.507 --> 01:16.542
Unlike you, I didn't
deserve to be there.

01:16.544 --> 01:19.745
How did you stay sane?

01:19.747 --> 01:23.248
A brain like yours needs stimulation

01:23.250 --> 01:25.751
in such a gray place.

01:25.753 --> 01:27.720
I worked in the laundry
room and I played chess.

01:27.722 --> 01:29.121
That's 3, maybe 4 hours, tops.

01:29.123 --> 01:30.322
What about the other 20?

01:30.324 --> 01:31.457
I read.

01:31.459 --> 01:32.424
That's still not enough.

01:32.426 --> 01:36.695
You have to... go someplace.

01:36.697 --> 01:38.731
Up here.

01:39.333 --> 01:42.606
Or else you go crazy.

01:43.237 --> 01:45.504
Do you want to see where I go?

01:45.506 --> 01:46.772
I'll show you.

01:46.774 --> 01:48.173
Come here.

01:51.045 --> 01:53.178
No touching.

01:58.519 --> 02:00.586
Close your eyes.

02:00.588 --> 02:02.688
Good. Now keep them shut.

02:05.159 --> 02:07.760
Sit back and relax.

02:08.628 --> 02:10.763
Now, when you open your eyes,

02:10.764 --> 02:12.765
I want you to look at me

02:12.767 --> 02:14.199
like I'm the first woman you've seen

02:14.201 --> 02:17.269
after being in prison for 3 months.

02:18.072 --> 02:21.106
Now... Open.

02:23.077 --> 02:25.477
Hello, Cat.

02:25.479 --> 02:29.681
You're here!

02:29.683 --> 02:31.049
You're really here.

02:31.051 --> 02:35.083
There's nowhere else I would rather be.

02:35.890 --> 02:38.123
You're good at this.

02:38.125 --> 02:40.926
You're so good at this,

02:40.928 --> 02:43.896
I almost believe you
don't want to kill me.

02:43.898 --> 02:44.963
I don't want to kill you.

02:44.965 --> 02:46.398
No?

02:46.400 --> 02:47.866
No.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.737
What if I let your mother die?

02:51.739 --> 02:54.439
Then would you kill me?

02:54.441 --> 02:57.476
Or would you just...

02:57.478 --> 02:58.577
Hurt me?

02:58.579 --> 03:00.078
Would you pin me down

03:00.080 --> 03:02.681
and leave bruises that don't go away?

03:02.683 --> 03:04.917
Is that what you want?

03:04.919 --> 03:08.921
I guess I just want
to know if you would.

03:08.923 --> 03:11.857
If you could.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.192
No.

03:13.194 --> 03:14.393
No?

03:14.395 --> 03:17.863
It's not the kind of man I am.

03:17.865 --> 03:21.600
Do me a favor and
tell blondie over there

03:21.602 --> 03:23.602
to step aside,

03:23.604 --> 03:26.104
because we're gonna play another game.

03:26.106 --> 03:27.439
And this time,

03:27.441 --> 03:29.675
we're going to find out exactly

03:29.677 --> 03:32.277
what kind of man you are.

But I will better the instruction.”

04:32.924 --> 04:34.190
Are you hungry?

04:34.192 --> 04:35.858
No.

04:35.860 --> 04:39.228
Me neither.

04:39.230 --> 04:41.731
So the same game as last time?

04:41.733 --> 04:44.167
I answer every question
you ask honestly?

04:44.169 --> 04:47.103
No, this time you get
to ask the questions.

04:47.105 --> 04:48.671
About what?

04:48.673 --> 04:53.276
Well, I know a secret. About you.

04:53.278 --> 04:55.945
And you can ask me as
many questions as you like

04:55.947 --> 04:57.213
to figure it out.

04:57.215 --> 05:00.483
But you only get one
guess as to what it is.

05:00.485 --> 05:03.986
Now, guess correctly, I take your phone,

05:03.988 --> 05:05.621
I call our friend Lindsey,

05:05.623 --> 05:10.893
and I tell her to release
your mother unharmed.

05:10.895 --> 05:13.196
If you don't...

05:21.873 --> 05:23.539
Is there a clock?

05:23.541 --> 05:25.541
There's always a clock.

05:27.879 --> 05:29.912
Give it to me.

05:37.856 --> 05:40.223
Now, you'll have 4 hours.

05:40.225 --> 05:42.625
Not yet.

05:42.627 --> 05:47.130
You have to wait till the
second hand comes around.

05:47.132 --> 05:48.664
You want to give me a
hint before we start?

05:48.666 --> 05:51.300
Do I look like a girl that gives hints?

05:51.302 --> 05:52.835
Actually you do.

05:55.874 --> 05:57.874
Ok, how about this?

05:57.876 --> 06:02.812
It's a secret you'll never admit to.

06:06.084 --> 06:08.251
Go.

06:08.253 --> 06:10.887
Up till now, Cat Adams
has only worked solo.

06:10.889 --> 06:12.755
But this is a partnership.

06:12.757 --> 06:16.392
So we need to figure out
how these two hit women

06:16.394 --> 06:17.827
were able to work together,

06:17.829 --> 06:20.229
especially when one of
them was in solitary.

06:20.231 --> 06:23.733
And hit men are drive by
profit and self-preservation.

06:23.735 --> 06:26.135
They don't take a job unless
they know all the angles.

06:26.137 --> 06:28.070
So, to predict their behavior,

06:28.072 --> 06:30.173
we need to ask ourselves
a simple question.

06:30.175 --> 06:32.441
We know why Cat wanted revenge on Reid.

06:32.443 --> 06:34.544
Why does Lindsey?

06:34.546 --> 06:35.778
10 years ago,

06:35.780 --> 06:36.979
Reid tried to talk Lindsey's father

06:36.981 --> 06:39.248
out of one last murder.

06:39.250 --> 06:40.883
Cut to last year and she finds out

06:40.885 --> 06:43.386
her BFF Cat has been arrested

06:43.388 --> 06:46.656
by the same federal agent
who tried to stop her daddy.

06:46.658 --> 06:49.392
So Lindsey's emotions
trumped her professionalism.

06:49.394 --> 06:52.261
She could grab and kill
Reid's mother without a trace,

06:52.263 --> 06:56.098
but instead, she waltzed
Diana into his prison

06:56.100 --> 06:59.769
because she wanted him and us
to know that she was involved.

06:59.771 --> 07:02.805
But there's risky and there's reckless.

07:02.807 --> 07:04.941
It's kind of hard to buy
that Lindsey would commit

07:04.943 --> 07:06.509
to doing all of this just because Reid

07:06.511 --> 07:09.212
kind of sort of got in
her way 10 years ago.

07:13.751 --> 07:14.984
We're missing something.

07:17.989 --> 07:21.357
Oh, damn. Lindsey's APB
didn't turn anything up.

07:21.359 --> 07:23.426
Neither did Diana's photo
on the national center

07:23.428 --> 07:24.894
for missing adults database.

07:24.896 --> 07:27.263
Lindsey's too good to get
caught in those dragnets.

07:27.265 --> 07:31.180
She's probably already changed
cars and appearance by now.

07:32.703 --> 07:34.210
_

07:34.302 --> 07:37.173
Ok, I want a full breakdown
on Lindsey's life.

07:37.175 --> 07:39.475
Aliases, contacts, hits,

07:39.477 --> 07:42.111
where she gets her hollowpoint rounds.

07:42.113 --> 07:43.179
Yeah, Walker and I will take that.

07:43.181 --> 07:44.714
Then I want a list of everyone

07:44.716 --> 07:46.482
who was in Cat's
prison in the past year.

07:46.484 --> 07:48.484
Cat was communicating with Lindsey

07:48.486 --> 07:50.319
through a maximum security facility.

07:50.321 --> 07:52.855
Somewhere there is a
weak link to her chain.

07:52.857 --> 07:54.824
We'll find her.

08:06.404 --> 08:08.804
Hey. I... I got your text message.

08:08.806 --> 08:10.072
I'm confused. You want me to see

08:10.074 --> 08:11.707
if there are any missing children?

08:11.709 --> 08:13.709
No. I asked if any Amber
alerts had been issued tonight.

08:13.711 --> 08:15.444
No. Is that important?

08:15.446 --> 08:17.980
Yes. I'm gonna put one out.

08:17.982 --> 08:19.215
You're gonna put out Diana Reid's face

08:19.217 --> 08:20.716
and says she's a missing child?

08:20.718 --> 08:23.052
No, I'm gonna put Lindsey's
out as an abductor.

08:23.054 --> 08:25.321
People pay attention to Ambers,

08:25.323 --> 08:26.923
and that's what we need.

08:26.925 --> 08:30.092
Ok. Oh...

08:30.094 --> 08:32.328
I'll do it.

08:32.330 --> 08:34.764
Penelope, no. It's my call.

08:34.765 --> 08:36.666
Which means I'll take
responsibility for it.

08:36.668 --> 08:38.868
Just pull the screen up, ok?

08:49.414 --> 08:52.048
I need you to leave.

08:52.050 --> 08:53.449
Right now.

09:02.694 --> 09:05.995
All right. We got 30 employees

09:05.997 --> 09:07.363
that worked on Cat's wing.

09:07.365 --> 09:10.599
And these 4, they don't have
any disciplinary problems.

09:10.601 --> 09:13.402
So Cat used one, or
more likely more than one

09:13.404 --> 09:15.471
to coordinate with
Lindsey on the outside.

09:15.473 --> 09:16.739
That's the good news.

09:16.741 --> 09:18.574
Oh, lovely. We need more bad news.

09:18.576 --> 09:21.043
The guard union got wind
that I was sniffing around.

09:21.045 --> 09:23.546
These 26 potential accomplices,

09:23.548 --> 09:25.014
they can't be interviewed

09:25.016 --> 09:27.650
without submitting all
questions through the local 292

09:27.652 --> 09:29.552
and their accompanying attorneys first.

09:29.554 --> 09:31.420
Ok. Let's do some digging.

09:31.422 --> 09:35.257
A couple of these folks are gonna
look more guilty than the rest.

09:35.259 --> 09:39.501
We'll winnow it down and
then deal with the local.

09:41.566 --> 09:42.565
What have you got?

09:42.567 --> 09:44.133
We looked for overlap

09:44.135 --> 09:46.469
with all of Lindsey's known
aliases and we found one.

09:46.471 --> 09:49.372
She made multiple purchases
using multiple IDs

09:49.374 --> 09:50.539
at the same location.

09:50.541 --> 09:51.974
Fords gun shop.

09:51.976 --> 09:53.242
And wouldn't you know it,

09:53.244 --> 09:54.343
he has the largest
selection of hollow point

09:54.345 --> 09:56.212
ammunition in the tri-state area.

09:56.214 --> 09:58.247
Go, quickly. We are on Cat's clock now.

09:58.249 --> 10:00.483
We only have 3 1/2 hours left.

10:01.419 --> 10:04.153
I know what the secret is.

10:04.155 --> 10:06.489
You do?

10:06.491 --> 10:08.124
Why else would you put
me through all this?

10:08.126 --> 10:10.292
Ooh. Phrasing it in
the form of a question.

10:10.294 --> 10:11.927
That way it doesn't count as a guess.

10:11.929 --> 10:13.329
Very smart, doctor.

10:13.331 --> 10:14.730
I'm gonna walk you through a scenario

10:14.732 --> 10:18.134
and your face is gonna
tell me how close I am.

10:18.136 --> 10:20.436
From the moment I arrested you,

10:20.438 --> 10:23.906
you watched and waited for the
right time to take your revenge.

10:23.908 --> 10:26.175
When you learned I was
going to Mexico, you took it.

10:26.177 --> 10:28.344
You and Lindsey framed me for murder

10:28.346 --> 10:30.513
so I'd be put in prison
and treated like a criminal,

10:30.515 --> 10:32.048
and then you kidnapped my mother

10:32.050 --> 10:34.950
so I would know how it feels
to have a parent manipulated,

10:34.952 --> 10:39.188
because you want to prove
that you and I are the same.

10:39.190 --> 10:41.857
Am I right?

10:44.729 --> 10:47.096
Mm.

10:47.098 --> 10:51.133
Sorry, I couldn't hold
that in any longer.

10:51.135 --> 10:53.035
What were you saying?

10:53.037 --> 10:54.770
Psychopaths get bored easily.

10:54.772 --> 10:56.505
You're right.

10:56.507 --> 10:59.008
Let's speed this up.

10:59.010 --> 11:00.242
Shall we?

11:00.244 --> 11:04.980
Why don't you think about all the pain

11:04.982 --> 11:07.283
you've suffered in your life.

11:07.285 --> 11:10.786
What would I capitalize
on, do you think?

11:10.788 --> 11:16.158
Is it the death of your mentor,

11:16.160 --> 11:19.028
SSA Jason Gideon?

11:19.030 --> 11:20.529
No.

11:20.531 --> 11:23.132
Because we caught the
man who killed him.

11:25.303 --> 11:29.505
What about Agent Morgan?

11:29.507 --> 11:34.110
And your guilt over not
visiting his little boy.

11:34.112 --> 11:37.346
I was in prison.

11:37.348 --> 11:40.683
Yeah, but you had time before that.

11:40.685 --> 11:41.884
Why didn't you go?

11:41.886 --> 11:44.086
Truthfully, I got distracted.

11:44.088 --> 11:46.989
I was trying to figure
out a way to help my mom.

11:46.991 --> 11:48.491
She didn't have time.

11:48.493 --> 11:51.660
Morgan, Savannah, and little Bobby did.

11:51.662 --> 11:54.797
So there's absolutely no
shame in admitting that.

11:54.799 --> 11:56.465
Morgan would understand.

11:56.467 --> 11:58.300
I agree.

11:58.302 --> 12:00.736
That's why that's not the secret.

12:06.811 --> 12:09.778
Good job, Spence.

12:13.217 --> 12:14.450
Go ahead, JJ.

12:14.452 --> 12:16.785
So Cat has deep background on Spence.

12:16.787 --> 12:19.155
She knew about Gideon death
and Morgan leaving the team

12:19.157 --> 12:20.322
for his family.

12:20.324 --> 12:21.423
She's throwing him off-balance.

12:21.425 --> 12:23.859
Yeah, but Spence also purposely

12:23.861 --> 12:25.761
gave the wrong name of Morgan's son,

12:25.763 --> 12:27.463
and she didn't correct him.

12:27.465 --> 12:29.932
She must have gotten her hands
on Reid's confidential FBI file.

12:29.934 --> 12:31.867
It would mention
relevant team information

12:31.869 --> 12:34.937
but wouldn't name Morgan's baby
because of confidentiality reasons.

12:34.939 --> 12:36.705
We were thinking she's been getting help

12:36.707 --> 12:38.574
from someone inside the prison.

12:38.576 --> 12:40.276
This goes deeper than that.

12:43.981 --> 12:45.714
Huh.

12:45.716 --> 12:48.184
Nope.

12:48.186 --> 12:49.652
You've never seen this woman.

12:49.654 --> 12:52.521
She didn't buy hollow point
rounds from you?

12:52.523 --> 12:53.689
No, ma'am.

12:53.691 --> 12:57.226
See... see, it's the way you said “huh.”

12:57.228 --> 12:59.028
it makes me think you have seen her

12:59.030 --> 13:02.598
and then you decided
to cover and say no.

13:02.600 --> 13:03.632
Huh.

13:03.634 --> 13:05.768
Look, Mr. Fords, we appreciate

13:05.770 --> 13:08.571
that our kind isn't welcome around here.

13:08.573 --> 13:11.240
Hey, I don't judge folks
by the color of their skin.

13:11.242 --> 13:14.810
Well, I was thinking more
us being federal agents.

13:14.812 --> 13:16.679
The last thing you
want is your customers

13:16.681 --> 13:18.948
to see you ratting them out to us.

13:18.950 --> 13:21.250
Something did bother
you about this woman.

13:21.252 --> 13:23.953
Like how she was so petite
and yet so experienced

13:23.955 --> 13:26.855
around a hand cannon like
a .50-caliber Desert Eagle.

13:26.857 --> 13:28.691
Or the fact that she
used multiple identities

13:28.693 --> 13:30.893
when she was buying ammunition for it.

13:30.895 --> 13:35.030
Second. That's the amendment that
guarantees my customers' right to bear arms.

13:35.032 --> 13:37.800
Fifth. That's the amendment
where my customers'

13:37.802 --> 13:40.002
right to privacy is established.

13:40.004 --> 13:42.071
Griswold v. Connecticut, I believe.

13:42.073 --> 13:44.573
This woman works for the drug cartels.

13:44.575 --> 13:46.942
We need to find her before
she kills another victim.

13:46.944 --> 13:49.478
Cartels. Her.

13:49.480 --> 13:52.648
Jesus wept. That's one hell of a story.

13:52.650 --> 13:55.517
Well, tell us another one, then.

13:55.519 --> 13:58.220
The reason why that little
miss has multiple IDs

13:58.222 --> 14:02.658
is because she's been harassed
by bigots her entire life.

14:04.228 --> 14:07.763
And now her and her fiance fell in love.

14:07.765 --> 14:11.300
Her fiance? She was engaged?

14:11.302 --> 14:14.270
And just as I don't judge race,

14:14.272 --> 14:16.338
I don't judge folks by
who they love, either.

14:16.340 --> 14:18.974
Now get the hell out of my store,

14:18.976 --> 14:21.710
'cause unless there's a Supreme
Court case I haven't heard of,

14:21.712 --> 14:26.649
Obergefell v. Hodges is
still the law of the land.

14:35.059 --> 14:37.192
Working deductively,
the secret wouldn't be

14:37.194 --> 14:38.861
any of the topics you've
already volunteered,

14:38.863 --> 14:41.130
because you wouldn't want
to make it that easy on me.

14:41.132 --> 14:42.765
Genius, truly.

14:42.767 --> 14:47.636
So what is left that I
wouldn't want to admit?

14:53.411 --> 14:55.144
Love.

14:57.848 --> 15:01.317
Is that what this is all about, love?

15:01.319 --> 15:04.053
Or my mother?

15:07.925 --> 15:10.359
No.

15:12.463 --> 15:15.097
For you.

15:15.099 --> 15:17.966
You want me to admit that I am actually

15:17.968 --> 15:20.336
in love with you.

15:20.338 --> 15:23.806
Don't get me wrong,
I love my fairy tales,

15:23.808 --> 15:25.774
clearly, as much as the next girl,

15:25.776 --> 15:28.544
but I'm not delusional.

15:28.546 --> 15:30.212
Are you sure about that?

15:30.214 --> 15:31.513
Very sure.

15:31.515 --> 15:34.416
So sure, in fact, that I had Lindsey

15:34.418 --> 15:38.053
leave a clue for you in your
little scrapbook in your house.

15:48.933 --> 15:51.467
I couldn't have you come all the
way down here and make a guess

15:51.469 --> 15:53.969
until I was positive.

15:53.971 --> 15:56.605
That is...

15:56.607 --> 15:59.708
Until I tested positive.

16:00.878 --> 16:03.379
What, you're pregnant?

16:07.718 --> 16:10.119
We're pregnant.

16:14.258 --> 16:15.657
No.

16:15.659 --> 16:17.493
Oh, yes.

16:18.963 --> 16:20.829
Mazel tov.

16:38.478 --> 16:39.526
Here you are, ma'am.

16:39.984 --> 16:40.815
Thank you.

16:43.959 --> 16:46.679
_

16:47.253 --> 16:48.553
It's not possible.

16:48.557 --> 16:50.490
Even if you are pregnant,
the baby's not mine.

16:50.492 --> 16:52.659
Except for the part where it is.

16:52.661 --> 16:54.261
That's completely preposterous.
You've been in prison.

16:54.263 --> 16:55.328
So have you.

16:55.330 --> 16:56.329
And we've never...

16:56.331 --> 16:58.231
I know. We've never...

17:00.802 --> 17:02.923
Ask me how I did it.

17:02.938 --> 17:04.971
Come on, ask me.

17:06.438 --> 17:08.070
How did you do it?

17:08.073 --> 17:10.839
I had Lindsey dose you in Mexico.

17:10.842 --> 17:12.142
You lost time.

17:12.144 --> 17:14.210
And I gave her very
specific instructions

17:14.212 --> 17:15.345
to get you in the mood.

17:15.347 --> 17:16.613
What, did she pretend to be you?

17:16.615 --> 17:19.182
Why, would that have worked?

17:19.184 --> 17:21.518
No.

17:21.520 --> 17:24.020
Yeah, I know, I know.

17:24.021 --> 17:26.256
Believe me, I know exactly where I stand

17:26.258 --> 17:29.425
on the Spencer Reid hot or not list.

17:31.129 --> 17:34.063
I told her to pretend to be Maeve.

17:36.334 --> 17:39.269
Maeve Donovan.

17:39.271 --> 17:41.938
The love of your life.

17:43.542 --> 17:47.410
Who had her brains blown
out right in front of you

17:47.412 --> 17:49.879
before you two could even kiss.

17:49.881 --> 17:53.650
So dark....

17:53.652 --> 17:56.786
Yet so useful.

17:57.822 --> 17:58.855
You're lying.

17:58.857 --> 18:01.791
Spencer, it's Maeve.

18:01.793 --> 18:03.726
It's ok.

18:03.728 --> 18:06.162
Spencer, Spencer...

18:06.164 --> 18:10.366
Spencer, it's Maeve.

18:11.603 --> 18:13.770
It's ok.

18:13.772 --> 18:15.672
Come here.

18:15.674 --> 18:17.440
Shh.

18:17.442 --> 18:19.576
You want this.

18:19.578 --> 18:21.277
It's ok.

18:21.279 --> 18:23.646
You want this.

18:27.085 --> 18:28.952
It didn't happen.

18:28.954 --> 18:32.655
Hey, I was thinking, if it's a boy,

18:32.657 --> 18:35.258
we should definitely
call him Spencie Junior.

18:35.260 --> 18:38.528
But if it's a girl, I think
we should call her Maeve.

18:38.530 --> 18:40.530
I mean, after all, she
played such a huge role

18:40.532 --> 18:42.065
in her own conception.

18:42.067 --> 18:45.702
Spence, we might have something.

18:45.704 --> 18:48.271
She's 3 months. The timeline matches,

18:48.273 --> 18:50.740
but that doesn't necessarily mean...

18:50.742 --> 18:53.076
I'm sorry, it's not you.

18:54.479 --> 18:57.529
I just need a minute.

19:03.888 --> 19:05.121
JJ, you there?

19:05.123 --> 19:06.923
Uh, yeah. Yeah, go ahead.

19:06.925 --> 19:09.525
So far we don't have anything
on the prison employees.

19:09.527 --> 19:11.327
Somebody in there is helping her,

19:11.329 --> 19:13.396
but nobody jumps out
as the obvious culprit,

19:13.398 --> 19:15.965
and it doesn't help that they're
blocking us at every turn.

19:15.967 --> 19:18.868
We have something,
but, uh, it's out there.

19:18.870 --> 19:20.536
I'll take out there.

19:20.538 --> 19:23.206
The gun store owner was more of a
libertarian than you would think.

19:23.208 --> 19:27.243
He talked about how he never judged
his customers or who they love.

19:27.245 --> 19:28.745
That's weird.

19:28.747 --> 19:32.181
Not as weird as when
he mentioned Obergefell.

19:32.183 --> 19:35.518
The Supreme Court decision
that legalized gay marriage.

19:35.520 --> 19:36.953
You said we were missing something

19:36.955 --> 19:38.721
in the relationship
between these two women.

19:38.723 --> 19:39.789
What if it's this?

19:39.791 --> 19:41.691
The risks that Lindsey's taking,

19:41.693 --> 19:44.127
the bond she as with Cat,
it's not professional.

19:44.129 --> 19:45.628
It's romantic.

19:45.630 --> 19:48.364
Well, this casts a big shadow
over Lindsey's next move.

19:48.366 --> 19:50.767
By exposing their plan to us, she knows

19:50.769 --> 19:53.236
there's no happy ending,
no future with Cat.

19:53.238 --> 19:55.505
And she's going to take
Reid's mother with her.

19:55.507 --> 19:57.640
And that's the ultimate act of revenge

19:57.642 --> 19:59.309
against the guy who took her lover away.

19:59.311 --> 20:01.344
JJ, what do you have?

20:01.346 --> 20:04.247
Will you take me off speaker.

20:09.387 --> 20:11.988
Are you kidding me? Are you kidding?

20:11.990 --> 20:13.156
Well, here's where it gets tricky.

20:13.158 --> 20:15.224
Do we believe her or not?

20:15.226 --> 20:17.160
On the one hand, getting pregnant

20:17.162 --> 20:18.961
is a power control move straight out of

20:18.963 --> 20:20.496
the female psychopath handbook.

20:20.498 --> 20:21.631
On the other hand...

20:21.633 --> 20:22.799
If her story is true,

20:22.801 --> 20:24.233
it meant she sent her lesbian lover

20:24.235 --> 20:27.170
down to Mexico to get
Reid to... ugh, yeah.

20:27.172 --> 20:29.505
Either way, she is pregnant.

20:29.507 --> 20:32.442
I just refuse to believe
it belongs to Spence.

20:32.444 --> 20:35.778
It could be the person inside
the prison who's been helping her.

20:35.780 --> 20:38.047
Getting pregnant serves two purposes...

20:38.049 --> 20:40.249
Gaslighting Reid and emotional blackmail

20:40.251 --> 20:41.751
against that employee.

20:41.753 --> 20:44.320
Yeah, but, Emily, we don't
know who that guy is yet.

20:45.623 --> 20:48.158
And Alvez and Rossi aren't going to
in the time they have left.

20:49.794 --> 20:52.254
JJ, I gotta call you back.

21:18.156 --> 21:20.089
How ya doin', good-lookin'?

21:21.693 --> 21:24.293
Come on, now, it doesn't
cost anything for a smile.

21:28.537 --> 21:30.957
_

21:46.651 --> 21:49.075
Hello.

21:49.254 --> 21:51.187
Uh, yeah, 911?

21:51.189 --> 21:52.855
That alert you guys sent out...

21:52.857 --> 21:55.024
I think she's here.

21:55.026 --> 21:56.392
I mean, she's blond,

21:56.394 --> 21:58.828
but I think I heard noises
coming from her truck.

21:58.830 --> 22:00.997
Yeah, I was...

22:08.740 --> 22:11.040
Let's pretend you're telling the truth.

22:11.042 --> 22:12.442
That means I guessed it, right?

22:12.444 --> 22:14.610
The secret, the one I
don't want to admit to?

22:14.612 --> 22:16.012
It's my child?

22:16.014 --> 22:17.447
Is that your guess?

22:17.449 --> 22:20.550
You only get one, remember?

22:20.552 --> 22:22.752
No. It's too easy.

22:22.754 --> 22:25.254
Believe me, getting pregnant
with your baby was not easy.

22:25.256 --> 22:28.691
You misunderstand.
It's too easy emotionally.

22:28.693 --> 22:31.027
Because I can take your child from you.

22:31.029 --> 22:33.863
The child I had absolutely
no role in creating,

22:33.865 --> 22:37.300
but a child that I would
care for better than you.

22:37.302 --> 22:38.634
That's rude.

22:38.636 --> 22:41.237
It's true. You can't be a mother, Cat.

22:41.239 --> 22:43.072
I'm not trying to insult you.

22:43.074 --> 22:44.440
It's your psychological makeup.

22:44.442 --> 22:47.777
You literally do not
have the emotional skills

22:47.779 --> 22:49.879
to care for another human being.

22:49.881 --> 22:52.348
You'd lose interest in your own baby

22:52.350 --> 22:56.252
the way a 6-year-old loses
interest in a pet hamster.

22:56.254 --> 22:58.654
This baby is simply a means to an end,

22:58.656 --> 23:00.823
which is to keep me
here playing your game,

23:00.825 --> 23:02.992
guessing like a fool, assuming something

23:02.994 --> 23:04.794
I never should have
assumed in the first place.

23:04.796 --> 23:07.819
And what would that be?

23:08.333 --> 23:10.333
My mother's already dead.

23:10.335 --> 23:11.701
She was dead before I walked in here.

23:11.703 --> 23:12.702
She's not dead.

23:12.704 --> 23:13.803
Yes, she is.

23:13.805 --> 23:15.037
No, because that would be cheating

23:15.039 --> 23:16.372
and I don't cheat. You cheat.

23:16.374 --> 23:17.373
I'm done playing.

23:17.375 --> 23:18.307
Get back here.

23:18.309 --> 23:19.308
Goodbye, Cat.

23:19.310 --> 23:22.078
I'll let you talk to her!

23:31.756 --> 23:32.456
Yes, I'm here.

23:32.509 --> 23:35.191
Garcia, get ready to trace
a call on Spence's phone.

23:35.193 --> 23:37.193
Fired up, plugged in.

23:37.195 --> 23:39.128
Ready to go.

23:47.472 --> 23:48.938
You're early.

23:48.940 --> 23:50.006
Yeah, I know.

23:50.008 --> 23:51.674
Did he guess?

23:51.676 --> 23:52.675
No, not yet.

23:52.677 --> 23:54.243
We need proof of life.

23:54.245 --> 23:55.344
All right.

23:55.346 --> 23:57.780
Hold on.

23:58.783 --> 24:01.484
Spencer!

24:01.486 --> 24:02.685
Mom, Mom, are you ok?

24:02.687 --> 24:04.620
I don't... know.

24:05.757 --> 24:08.024
Mom!

24:09.561 --> 24:11.360
Gotta go.

24:37.288 --> 24:38.654
Mom!

24:38.656 --> 24:40.489
What the hell was that?

24:40.491 --> 24:41.791
I don't know.

24:41.793 --> 24:43.159
Lindsey said you were
early. Was that a signal?

24:43.161 --> 24:44.994
Was that a prearranged
signal to kill my mother?!

24:44.996 --> 24:47.496
- Tell me the truth!
- I am!

24:47.498 --> 24:49.031
- Tell me the truth!
- I am.

24:49.033 --> 24:49.797
You want to know the truth?

24:49.797 --> 24:52.568
Your mother is an
Alzheimer's-ridden moron

24:52.570 --> 24:54.036
who's getting dumber day by day,

24:54.038 --> 24:56.038
and if she's dead, it's your fault.

24:59.177 --> 25:00.509
Spence!

25:00.511 --> 25:02.211
I'm going to kill you.

25:02.213 --> 25:03.212
Spence.

25:03.214 --> 25:04.680
I'm going to kill you.

25:04.682 --> 25:06.716
Spence, she's pregnant.
Spence, she's pregnant!

25:06.718 --> 25:08.784
- Stop it!
- I'm going to kill you.

25:08.786 --> 25:11.654
Come on. Come on.

25:30.349 --> 25:33.818
Richmond County police just reported
a gas station explosion.

25:33.881 --> 25:36.415
One victim, a male.
Whatever Lindsey did,

25:36.417 --> 25:38.517
we have to assume
your mom's still alive.

25:41.856 --> 25:44.256
Hey.

25:51.533 --> 25:55.201
I'm really scared this is who I am now.

25:55.203 --> 25:58.638
No. Don't say that.

25:58.640 --> 26:02.475
Je... Jennifer, you don't know...

26:04.037 --> 26:05.318
I do know.

26:05.410 --> 26:08.678
I know two inmates, Frazier and Duerson,

26:08.680 --> 26:10.913
killed your friend
Delgado in front of you.

26:10.915 --> 26:14.016
And I know they wanted
you to move their heroin,

26:14.018 --> 26:15.217
and I also know that if you didn't,

26:15.219 --> 26:17.320
you would have been next, right?

26:18.523 --> 26:22.692
Spence, anyone in your spot
would have done the same thing.

26:22.694 --> 26:23.693
You wouldn't have.

26:23.695 --> 26:26.662
Yeah. Yeah, I would have, Spence.

26:26.664 --> 26:29.231
If someone was threatening my life,

26:29.233 --> 26:30.666
you bet your ass I would.

26:30.668 --> 26:34.070
It doesn't make you a bad person.

26:34.072 --> 26:36.372
'Cause you know who
does think like that,

26:36.374 --> 26:39.308
that... that in you doing
what you had to do to survive

26:39.310 --> 26:42.411
somehow makes you a psychopath?

26:42.413 --> 26:44.413
She does.

26:46.851 --> 26:49.051
She does.

26:49.053 --> 26:50.920
She does.

26:50.922 --> 26:53.489
Because she... she knows.

26:53.491 --> 26:54.957
That's the secret.

26:57.028 --> 26:58.861
What I don't want to admit about myself.

26:58.863 --> 27:00.529
Hold up. Let's play this out,

27:00.531 --> 27:02.365
because she will not lose to you twice.

27:02.367 --> 27:04.567
She already said that this wasn't
about the two of you being the same.

27:04.569 --> 27:05.635
Then she's all about the game.

27:05.637 --> 27:06.869
She thinks that I cheated last time

27:06.871 --> 27:08.371
because I lied about her dad,

27:08.373 --> 27:09.805
so it's integral to
her that she beats me

27:09.807 --> 27:11.107
by following the rules.

27:11.109 --> 27:12.475
Yeah, but, Spence,
she controls the rules,

27:12.477 --> 27:14.377
and she will change them
to ensure that she wins.

27:14.379 --> 27:15.478
Which means that I'm locked in.

27:15.480 --> 27:16.612
Like she is.

27:16.614 --> 27:17.124
And she needs me locked in,

27:17.124 --> 27:19.843
playing by her rules a
game I can't win, so she...

27:23.187 --> 27:24.621
I got it.

27:28.493 --> 27:31.894
Guess that's one way to get
you to put your hands on me.

27:31.896 --> 27:34.605
Dance with me.

27:34.899 --> 27:36.265
Why?

27:36.267 --> 27:37.533
Because I don't want
the people watching us

27:37.535 --> 27:40.273
to hear what I'm going to say next.

27:48.713 --> 27:50.079
You guys got this up?

27:50.081 --> 27:51.313
Streaming now.

27:51.315 --> 27:52.982
Ok, uh, listen, you're gonna hear

27:52.984 --> 27:54.083
a lot of weird stuff,

27:54.085 --> 27:56.085
like Spence saying he is the father

27:56.087 --> 27:58.120
of Cat's baby.
Don't let that distract you.

27:58.122 --> 27:59.522
Uh, I'm sorry. Full stop.

27:59.524 --> 28:00.556
Why would Spence say
he's the father of...

28:00.558 --> 28:01.924
Quiet.

28:03.928 --> 28:07.329
You had eyes on me while I
was in prison, didn't you?

28:07.331 --> 28:09.565
Spencie, don't ruin the moment.

28:09.567 --> 28:11.667
I don't want to, but I'm on the clock.

28:11.669 --> 28:13.769
Answer my question. Am I right?

28:13.771 --> 28:15.237
Yes, you're right.

28:15.239 --> 28:16.939
I wanted to make sure things

28:16.941 --> 28:19.341
were just as uncomfortable
for you as they were for me.

28:19.343 --> 28:22.978
That's what we missed, the inside
man that's been helping them.

28:22.980 --> 28:24.346
He didn't just work at Cat's prison,

28:24.348 --> 28:25.881
he worked at hers and Reid's.

28:25.883 --> 28:27.550
Garcia, look for any overlap.

28:27.552 --> 28:29.385
Compiling now.

28:30.188 --> 28:31.454
Here's something.

28:31.456 --> 28:33.689
Lionel Wilkins. He worked
at both Mount Pleasant

28:33.691 --> 28:35.091
and the Millburn correctional facility.

28:35.093 --> 28:36.892
Ok, look, this guy could
have gotten her pregnant,

28:36.894 --> 28:38.961
but there's no way he could have
gotten his hand on Reid's file.

28:38.963 --> 28:40.930
Well, not directly. He
could have called in a favor

28:40.932 --> 28:42.565
from a friend at the Bureau.

28:42.567 --> 28:44.834
So someone must have wanted
to screw us this whole time.

28:44.836 --> 28:47.570
Someone who's not gonna work
for the Bureau much longer.

28:47.572 --> 28:49.939
That's how you timed
everything so perfectly.

28:49.941 --> 28:52.108
Like sending my mom
and Lindsey to visit me

28:52.110 --> 28:54.677
when I thought I was at my lowest.

28:54.679 --> 28:57.146
Thought?

28:57.148 --> 29:01.117
You sure you weren't?

29:01.119 --> 29:03.519
No, I wasn't.

29:03.521 --> 29:06.288
Because I didn't feel bad.

29:06.290 --> 29:08.390
I felt scared.

29:08.392 --> 29:11.093
At how much I enjoyed

29:11.095 --> 29:13.496
poisoning the other prisoners.

29:13.498 --> 29:16.866
I had a hundred ways of getting
myself out of that situation,

29:16.868 --> 29:21.704
and I picked the one that
would cause them the most pain.

29:21.706 --> 29:24.039
Well, look at that.

29:24.041 --> 29:27.643
You might end up saving
your mother's life after all.

29:27.645 --> 29:29.712
Ok, Lionel Wilkins' primary residence

29:29.714 --> 29:32.381
is in Falls Church, but I
also have a second address.

29:32.383 --> 29:35.084
It's a cabin off of
the Rappahannock river.

29:35.086 --> 29:37.820
The cabin is in Lindsey's
zone based on the gas stations.

29:37.822 --> 29:41.200
Helos are on the roof
forming up. Let's go.

29:49.367 --> 29:52.334
She's in the backseat.

30:13.257 --> 30:16.477
All right.

30:16.494 --> 30:19.228
I did everything you and her wanted.

30:19.230 --> 30:22.498
I'm done here, right?

30:39.872 --> 30:41.297
They won't get there in time.

30:41.352 --> 30:42.985
They must be on their way, right?

30:42.987 --> 30:46.989
Your team is too good
to wait around, but,

30:46.991 --> 30:51.160
you know me. I always
have a contingency plan.

30:51.162 --> 30:53.329
So, they're walking into a trap.

31:09.547 --> 31:12.581
And the only way out is
if you give me your phone

31:12.583 --> 31:16.067
and your guess, right now.

31:23.227 --> 31:25.327
When we first sat down,

31:25.329 --> 31:26.595
you said you were going to show me

31:26.597 --> 31:28.030
what kind of man I am.

31:28.032 --> 31:29.798
And you have.

31:29.800 --> 31:33.335
Every time I touch this,
you're getting warmer.

31:53.824 --> 31:55.524
I'm waiting for a phone call.

31:55.526 --> 31:58.460
So are we, Lindsey.

32:01.232 --> 32:03.232
Whoa, whoa. It's ok.

32:03.234 --> 32:04.733
There it is.

32:04.735 --> 32:08.103
If this is a trick, I'm
going to kill all of us.

32:08.105 --> 32:10.773
I swear to you it's not a trick.

32:10.775 --> 32:12.207
And you'll want to hear what the person

32:12.209 --> 32:14.410
on the other end of
this line has to say.

32:14.412 --> 32:15.844
At first I was furious,

32:15.846 --> 32:18.213
because the secret had
to be the baby inside you.

32:18.215 --> 32:19.982
How could it be anything else?

32:19.984 --> 32:22.551
But then I realized that somehow,

32:22.553 --> 32:27.790
you knew I liked hurting those men.

32:27.792 --> 32:29.591
Now I know it's both things.

32:29.593 --> 32:31.560
So which is it, Spence?

32:31.562 --> 32:33.796
Come on. Don't fumble it now.

32:33.798 --> 32:35.965
You're at the one-yard line.

32:35.967 --> 32:38.334
You're not pregnant with my child.

32:38.336 --> 32:41.036
You got pregnant with Wilkins

32:41.038 --> 32:45.074
to put me in as compromised
a position as possible.

32:45.076 --> 32:48.745
But it should be mine.

32:48.980 --> 32:51.513
I wish it were mine.

32:51.515 --> 32:54.984
Because you and I...

32:54.986 --> 32:57.753
We deserve each other.

32:57.755 --> 33:01.590
That is the real secret.

33:17.041 --> 33:19.341
Kill her.

33:22.613 --> 33:23.879
Lindsey, I said...

33:23.881 --> 33:25.647
You bitch.

33:25.649 --> 33:27.449
You're pregnant?

33:30.021 --> 33:34.089
Lindsey, sweetheart,
it's complicated, ok?

33:34.091 --> 33:35.357
No, it's not.

33:35.359 --> 33:37.026
Playing the game with Reid

33:37.028 --> 33:40.863
was more important than
being faithful to you.

33:40.865 --> 33:44.700
And if you do this, she wins.

33:44.702 --> 33:46.568
Don't let her win.

34:12.596 --> 34:14.563
We're clear.

34:17.234 --> 34:18.567
Is my mom ok?

34:18.569 --> 34:20.202
Yeah. She's fine.

34:20.204 --> 34:23.906
We do deserve each other, by the way.

34:23.908 --> 34:25.774
You guessed right.

34:25.775 --> 34:27.643
You lied, by the way.

34:27.645 --> 34:30.379
You were going to kill
my mother regardless.

34:30.380 --> 34:33.982
Yeah, I think you really
liked hurting those men.

34:33.984 --> 34:36.685
And once you cross that line,

34:36.687 --> 34:39.788
you can't ever go back.

34:50.400 --> 34:52.734
Watch me.

35:27.805 --> 35:31.136
Spencer's here.

35:44.488 --> 35:46.455
Hi, Mom.

36:00.171 --> 36:02.437
Don't leave me,

36:02.439 --> 36:03.772
ever again.

36:03.774 --> 36:06.742
I won't.

36:29.967 --> 36:31.266
Where is he?

36:31.268 --> 36:33.569
I put him in your office
like you asked me to.

36:33.571 --> 36:35.037
Thank you.

36:46.984 --> 36:48.517
Hey.

36:48.519 --> 36:51.147
We need to talk.

36:55.829 --> 36:58.997
Derek, oh, my God.

36:58.999 --> 37:00.065
Oh, princess.

37:00.067 --> 37:02.367
Princess, princess.

37:02.369 --> 37:04.836
It is so good to see you.

37:04.838 --> 37:06.638
I'm liking your new digs.

37:06.640 --> 37:10.008
Ohh. I'm not crazy
about how I earned them.

37:10.010 --> 37:11.443
It's been a tough year.

37:11.445 --> 37:12.978
Yeah, I heard some of what
you've been going through.

37:12.980 --> 37:14.546
I mean, not everything.
Why didn't anyone tell me

37:14.548 --> 37:15.981
that the kid had been arrested?

37:15.983 --> 37:18.049
Reid made a list of people

37:18.051 --> 37:20.118
he was willing to see as visitors.

37:20.120 --> 37:21.253
You weren't on it.

37:21.255 --> 37:23.655
He was humiliated, and honestly,

37:23.657 --> 37:25.657
we were barely keeping it together.

37:25.659 --> 37:27.159
Garcia almost quit over it.

37:27.161 --> 37:29.995
All right, well, that might
explain this text that I got,

37:29.997 --> 37:32.097
but I don't know. Just
something didn't feel right.

37:32.099 --> 37:35.400
Garcia texted me, said
that Reid was out of prison

37:35.402 --> 37:36.968
and that he did want to see me.

37:36.970 --> 37:39.070
And he was staying in an FBI safe house

37:39.072 --> 37:41.072
where he was putting his
mother up for the night.

37:41.074 --> 37:43.141
I didn't approve that.

37:43.143 --> 37:46.278
You don't call, you don't write.

37:46.280 --> 37:47.512
Rossi...

37:48.515 --> 37:49.648
Ohh...

37:49.650 --> 37:50.949
You don't even give us a heads-up

37:50.951 --> 37:52.317
and you decide to pop in
at 3:00 in the morning.

37:52.319 --> 37:53.919
Oh, blondie, come here,
come here, come here.

37:53.921 --> 37:54.920
Hi.

37:54.922 --> 37:56.121
Mmm.

37:56.123 --> 37:59.024
Oh, it is so good to see all of you.

37:59.026 --> 38:01.793
Look, I wish I could say I
was just here to say hello,

38:01.795 --> 38:05.764
but, um, we may have bigger problems.

38:05.766 --> 38:07.666
You see what I'm saying about that text?

38:07.668 --> 38:09.568
It does not sound like Garcia.

38:09.570 --> 38:11.236
You do know what it does sound like.

38:11.238 --> 38:13.905
A trap.

38:17.711 --> 38:19.978
Hey, baby girl.

38:19.980 --> 38:23.114
Oh, my God! Oh, my God,
it's you! It's really you!

38:23.116 --> 38:26.551
Oh, you smell like... you
smell like hope and happiness.

38:26.553 --> 38:27.853
It is really you.

38:27.855 --> 38:28.954
Yes, it's me, it's me, but listen.

38:28.956 --> 38:30.222
You gotta focus, ok?

38:30.224 --> 38:31.590
Yeah. Anything. Anything.
Focus. Focus on what?

38:31.592 --> 38:32.855
This text.

38:33.961 --> 38:35.037
Oh, crap.

38:35.169 --> 38:37.784
_

38:39.166 --> 38:43.068
I know we're all tired, but we
might have a new lead on Mr. Scratch.

38:43.070 --> 38:44.836
Somebody did a bang-up job

38:44.838 --> 38:46.838
of cloning my cell phone to send Morgan

38:46.840 --> 38:48.573
a fake text luring him

38:48.575 --> 38:50.375
to a non-existent safe house.

38:50.377 --> 38:52.611
And whoever that somebody
is has mad skills.

38:52.613 --> 38:54.446
The kind of skills Scratch has.

38:54.448 --> 38:57.182
Were you able to trace
where the hack came from?

38:57.184 --> 38:59.651
Do you see what I have to put up with?

38:59.653 --> 39:02.354
Alvez, you'll always get
a location with this one.

39:02.356 --> 39:04.422
You guys are all good to go.

39:04.424 --> 39:06.424
Obviously Morgan can't come with us.

39:06.426 --> 39:07.425
He's a civilian now.

39:07.427 --> 39:09.313
We'll miss you out there.

39:09.496 --> 39:11.329
I'd be lying if I said I didn't miss it

39:11.331 --> 39:12.597
out there in the field with you guys.

39:12.599 --> 39:13.698
I think about it every day.

39:13.700 --> 39:15.534
But between my old friends

39:15.536 --> 39:18.136
and my new friends, you
guys are gonna go out there,

39:18.138 --> 39:19.437
you're gonna handle your business,

39:19.439 --> 39:20.539
you're gonna make people feel safe,

39:20.541 --> 39:21.606
and then you're gonna come home.

39:21.608 --> 39:22.741
And that's all that matters.

39:22.743 --> 39:24.643
Let's saddle up.

39:28.749 --> 39:31.316
Hey.

39:31.318 --> 39:33.385
Walk me back to my lair.

39:35.122 --> 39:38.720
So what's the other reason
you're not going with the team?

39:38.759 --> 39:41.059
Baby girl, I made a promise to my son.

39:41.061 --> 39:43.495
Now, obviously he's not
old enough to understand it,

39:43.497 --> 39:45.096
but that's not what matters.

39:45.098 --> 39:48.133
My promise was that I would
come home to him every night,

39:48.135 --> 39:49.434
and so far, I haven't broken it.

39:49.436 --> 39:50.535
How is Hank?

39:50.537 --> 39:52.571
He just started walking.

39:52.573 --> 39:56.308
Well, it's more like this little waddle.

39:56.310 --> 39:57.943
But the kid is walking.

39:57.945 --> 40:01.379
You know, I had no idea
that I could love this much.

40:01.381 --> 40:03.315
Ok, I just have to say something.

40:03.317 --> 40:05.016
Of all the heroes I have met,

40:05.018 --> 40:06.284
and I have met a lot of heroes,

40:06.286 --> 40:08.987
you, Derek, “Chocolate Thunder” Morgan,

40:08.989 --> 40:12.157
are the most heroic.

40:12.159 --> 40:14.659
Ohh, ohh, ohh!

40:14.661 --> 40:15.860
That's for you.

40:15.862 --> 40:17.796
This is for Hank. And Savannah.

40:17.798 --> 40:20.966
This one is for you again.

40:20.968 --> 40:22.867
Oh, as for Hank, if you leave right now,

40:22.869 --> 40:24.936
you'll get home before he wakes up.

40:24.938 --> 40:27.172
Actually, I told Savannah
I was going to catch a later flight.

40:27.174 --> 40:29.674
I reached out to Reid for real.

40:29.676 --> 40:31.543
I want to see him, I gotta see him,

40:31.545 --> 40:33.478
so, I'm gonna bring him some breakfast

40:33.480 --> 40:36.027
and make sure him and his mom are ok.

40:40.621 --> 40:43.855
I am so proud of you.

40:43.857 --> 40:46.825
I love you, always.

40:46.827 --> 40:49.628
But do you think you can try

40:49.630 --> 40:52.263
to be a little friendlier to Alvez?

40:52.265 --> 40:53.298
Oh, my God.

40:53.300 --> 40:54.966
Hey, hey, hey. Look at me.

40:54.968 --> 40:56.735
He seems like a pretty all right kid.

40:56.737 --> 40:59.070
He... I... it's complicated. I'll try.

40:59.072 --> 41:01.160
I make no promises.

41:03.543 --> 41:05.877
Go save some lives, baby girl.

41:05.879 --> 41:07.746
Ok.

41:08.148 --> 41:10.115
Meow.

41:12.486 --> 41:15.720
I hate it when you go, but
I love when you walk away.

41:15.722 --> 41:18.528
Here's another one.

41:20.327 --> 41:21.326
Got it?

41:21.328 --> 41:22.394
Uh-huh.

41:22.396 --> 41:24.596
Mm-hmm.

41:24.598 --> 41:27.623
Me... Too... You.

41:46.687 --> 41:49.598
All right, Voltron, sound off.

41:52.092 --> 41:53.925
Have we dispatched units to the location

41:53.927 --> 41:55.093
Scratch tried to lure us to?

41:55.095 --> 41:56.616
I coordinated it before we left.

41:56.616 --> 41:57.568
They're on their way.

41:57.659 --> 41:59.859
SWAT will meet us on
site at Scratch's house.

41:59.861 --> 42:02.695
I know we all want this son
of a bitch's head on a platter,

42:02.697 --> 42:05.165
but SWAT has to clear every single
room before we step foot inside.

42:05.167 --> 42:07.867
Have they been briefed?
This guy's traps set traps.

42:07.869 --> 42:09.702
The house itself could be a setup.

42:09.704 --> 42:12.005
Or a waste of our time
so he can get away.

42:12.007 --> 42:14.107
Whatever it is, he's gonna
try to take us by surprise.

42:14.109 --> 42:15.975
We have to be ready for anything.

42:33.569 --> 42:35.124
Is everyone OK?

42:35.124 --> 42:36.930
Yeah.

42:36.932 --> 42:38.464
Yeah, yeah, we're good.
