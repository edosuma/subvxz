00:01.538 --> 00:03.368
- Salem.
- Oh! Glee-club!

00:03.403 --> 00:05.354
Oh man, don't do that to me.

00:05.572 --> 00:07.488
Sorry, but I need a favour.

00:07.523 --> 00:09.775
See, I haven't had a date in weeks..

00:09.776 --> 00:11.976
- No.
- Come on, you've done it before.

00:11.978 --> 00:13.196
Well I'm not doing it again.

00:13.231 --> 00:14.288
I'll make it worth your while.

00:15.199 --> 00:17.399
Okay, but it's gonna cost you.

00:19.485 --> 00:20.685
Here's your cat ma'am.

00:20.686 --> 00:22.754
I can't believe he did that.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.478
Bad Kitty.

00:24.713 --> 00:26.328
Cat's aren't the brightest animals.

00:26.363 --> 00:28.017
You are so right. Aw!

00:28.394 --> 00:30.194
- Are you okay?
- Yeah I'm fine.

00:30.430 --> 00:32.079
Now how can I ever thank you?

00:33.066 --> 00:36.274
Oh look, a freshly baked,
home made seven layer cake.

00:36.709 --> 00:37.668
Would you like some?

00:37.904 --> 00:39.277
Was it made by a single gal?

00:39.305 --> 00:40.496
Yes sir-e

00:40.740 --> 00:43.340
Then I'll just put my ladder
away and be right back.

00:47.313 --> 00:48.602
Good work Salem.

00:48.648 --> 00:50.369
Show me the Tuna.

00:50.404 --> 00:52.484
Show me the Tuna.

00:52.485 --> 00:53.814
Say I love the black cat.

00:53.953 --> 00:54.953
I love the black cat.

00:54.954 --> 00:56.088
I can't hear you.

00:56.089 --> 00:58.689
- I LOVE THE BLACK CAT.
- I LOVE THE BLACK CAT.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000

01:24.017 --> 01:26.058
Yes, genetics will be on the final.

01:26.100 --> 01:28.800
Everything we study the
semester will be on the final.

01:28.999 --> 01:30.278
Including what mitosis is.

01:31.858 --> 01:33.121
It's not fair.

01:33.159 --> 01:36.359
We only get three days to learn
a whole semester's worth of biology.

01:36.529 --> 01:39.029
I guess we were supposed
to be learning it all along.

01:39.966 --> 01:41.458
I wish I could read my notes.

01:41.493 --> 01:42.893
Can you decipher this?

01:43.192 --> 01:45.878
'Mitosis is...' Nope.

01:46.654 --> 01:47.657
I'm doomed.

01:48.474 --> 01:49.574
Look, you can borrow my notes.

01:49.575 --> 01:50.908
We'll get through finals together.

01:51.077 --> 01:54.677
Well, if it isn't the cutest
couple in the sophomore class.

01:54.748 --> 01:56.587
Jeez Libby, you're really
running out of insults.

01:56.716 --> 01:59.716
No. I'm on the year book committee
and I just thought you'd like to know

01:59.717 --> 02:01.317
you've been voted cutest couple.

02:01.878 --> 02:03.478
I'd like to thank the academy.

02:03.857 --> 02:05.857
You're being very brave about this Sabrina,

02:05.858 --> 02:07.180
considering the curse.

02:07.360 --> 02:08.560
What curse?

02:08.561 --> 02:09.999
Every couple who ever won the award

02:10.100 --> 02:11.601
broke up by the first day of finals.

02:11.865 --> 02:12.965
That's ridiculous

02:12.966 --> 02:14.029
And sad.

02:16.202 --> 02:18.908
Well you don't think there's a curse do you?

02:19.072 --> 02:21.333
No, we're solid as a rock.

02:21.441 --> 02:25.812
Curses belong in fairy tales along
with giant beanstalks and witches.

02:28.081 --> 02:30.323
Zelda, will you do me a favour
and choke on this bread?

02:30.358 --> 02:32.405
- What?
- I can't think of any other way

02:32.419 --> 02:33.670
to see my fireman again.

02:33.920 --> 02:36.129
You choke, he Hiemlich's,
we go dancing.

02:36.256 --> 02:39.848
Hilda, it's wrong to distract
a fireman from his public duty.

02:39.883 --> 02:41.583
Hey, I pay taxes.

02:42.635 --> 02:44.091
Oh thank goodness you're home.

02:44.531 --> 02:45.914
- Choke on this.
- Gladly.

02:46.266 --> 02:47.698
Stop that.

02:49.114 --> 02:50.426
Is everything okay?

02:50.661 --> 02:52.560
It depends on whether curses are real or not.

02:52.872 --> 02:54.706
You see Harvey and I got
voted the cutest couple...

02:54.707 --> 02:55.903
No, OH NO!

02:55.938 --> 02:56.977
What

02:57.012 --> 02:58.967
Oh that's nothing, she's just excited for you.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.020
And don't you worry about this curse,

03:01.047 --> 03:02.758
- you're going to be fine.
- Really?

03:02.993 --> 03:04.488
Absolutely.

03:04.784 --> 03:07.784
Cool. Then all I have to worry about is finals.

03:10.990 --> 03:12.131
What are you saying?

03:12.166 --> 03:14.270
You know curses count double for witches.

03:14.327 --> 03:16.329
Yes, but there's nothing
Sabrina can do about it

03:16.396 --> 03:17.937
and knowing just makes it worse.

03:18.832 --> 03:20.032
Curses!

03:20.466 --> 03:22.548
Hurry up Sabrina, you're gonna miss the bus.

03:23.411 --> 03:25.909
Salem, have you seen my biology notes?

03:25.944 --> 03:28.355
No. The sports sections
lying in my box this week.

03:28.641 --> 03:29.775
Oh, but I need them!

03:29.776 --> 03:31.108
Chill little witch.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.724
Just use the finding
spell in your magic book.

03:35.155 --> 03:36.348
Ah, here we go.

03:36.349 --> 03:38.142
'Finder of lost things, help me find

03:38.177 --> 03:39.451
my enter lost item here..

03:40.920 --> 03:44.020
' Oh. 'Finder of lost things,
help me find my biology notes.'

03:50.063 --> 03:51.684
- I'm here.
- Who are you?

03:52.031 --> 03:53.599
Roland, finder of lost things

03:53.600 --> 03:54.633
number one thirty-four.

03:54.634 --> 03:55.697
Nice to meet you.

03:56.102 --> 03:59.370
If you could sign this contract I'll be
happy to get right to work.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.040
It's really long.

04:01.041 --> 04:04.041
That's just to cover us in the event
I get trapped under something heavy.

04:06.679 --> 04:07.680
There.

04:07.981 --> 04:10.655
Okay. Stand back please.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.156
Ah ha! I found your notes,

04:21.897 --> 04:23.479
and fifty cents.

04:23.514 --> 04:24.530
Thanks.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.400
Here you go.
Get yourself something nice.

04:30.337 --> 04:31.570
I'm not looking for a gratuity,

04:31.571 --> 04:32.805
just my standard fee,

04:33.006 --> 04:34.772
- What's that?
- Anything in this room.

04:34.968 --> 04:36.403
It says so right in that contract.

04:36.909 --> 04:39.766
Anything? Well I have quite a selection.

04:40.413 --> 04:42.460
How about this lovely paper weight?

04:42.495 --> 04:43.940
I don't need a paper weight.

04:44.150 --> 04:45.517
How's this bed?

04:47.287 --> 04:48.606
Hmm kinda lumpy.

04:49.698 --> 04:51.421
Oh I love this clock radio.

04:51.624 --> 04:53.117
Could you hurry up? I'm late for class.

04:54.594 --> 04:55.394
You know,

04:55.966 --> 04:57.985
you're kinda cute when you pout.

04:58.031 --> 04:59.220
Could you just decide?

04:59.265 --> 05:00.655
Okay, I know what I want.

05:00.790 --> 05:01.994
- You.
- Me!

05:02.229 --> 05:03.519
I want your hand in marriage.

05:03.554 --> 05:04.937
I'm only sixteen.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.490
I know you're kinda old but... that's okay.

05:10.177 --> 05:11.543
Idon'thavetimejusttnow.
There'satrollinmyroom.

05:11.544 --> 05:12.673
I'lltellyouaboutitlater.

05:12.908 --> 05:14.287
Did she say Troll?

05:15.215 --> 05:18.017
Testinal peristaltic action moves
food through the body,

05:18.118 --> 05:20.821
making digestion both a mechanical
and chemical process.

05:20.838 --> 05:21.854
Yes, Jenny?

05:21.855 --> 05:23.229
Did we even study that?

05:23.264 --> 05:24.482
For a week!

05:26.459 --> 05:27.684
Who's that?

05:28.728 --> 05:29.962
Oh no!

05:30.543 --> 05:31.330
How may I help you?

05:31.431 --> 05:33.476
I'm here to see Sabrina.
Personal matter.

05:33.765 --> 05:35.164
She's in the middle of class.

05:35.493 --> 05:37.073
I'll wait. Mind if I have a seat?

05:39.219 --> 05:40.310
Ah, He's an actor.

05:40.345 --> 05:41.879
You can catch him at the renaissance fare.

05:42.642 --> 05:44.136
Can we get back to learning?

05:46.212 --> 05:48.039
How long is the large intestine?

05:48.653 --> 05:50.442
- Oh, oh, Go me! Go me!
- Yes?

05:50.583 --> 05:52.267
The large intestine is over two miles long.

05:52.285 --> 05:54.042
- No it's not.
- Yes it is.

05:54.087 --> 05:55.312
It's five feet max.

05:55.347 --> 05:56.973
- What do you know?
- He's the teacher.

05:58.091 --> 06:00.391
I'm telling you, human beings
do not have four stomachs.

06:00.492 --> 06:02.397
Well let's open you up and find out.

06:02.432 --> 06:03.587
Leave me alone.

06:04.597 --> 06:06.017
That's all for today.

06:06.052 --> 06:07.409
I'm not finished yet.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.631
Who is that guy?

06:09.666 --> 06:11.246
Oh, it's a really funny story.

06:11.938 --> 06:14.022
I'll tell you about it later. Gotta go.

06:14.741 --> 06:17.185
So. Do you want a big wedding
or just the family?

06:17.210 --> 06:18.685
We're not getting married.

06:18.812 --> 06:20.279
Hey Harvey, come sit with us.

06:20.352 --> 06:21.857
- Who's that?
- My boyfriend.

06:21.992 --> 06:23.060
Boyfriend?

06:23.216 --> 06:25.046
- Hi guys.
- Harvey, this is Roland.

06:25.814 --> 06:26.814
Nice to meet you.

06:26.815 --> 06:28.286
Get lost, farm boy.

06:28.288 --> 06:31.114
Farm boy? I've never
been on a farm in my life.

06:31.157 --> 06:33.405
Well I find that hard to believe,
farm boy.

06:33.851 --> 06:35.106
My names Harvey.

06:35.362 --> 06:37.202
Harvey, the farm boy.

06:37.464 --> 06:38.791
Why don't you back off!

06:38.826 --> 06:40.593
Why don't you make me?

06:43.870 --> 06:45.537
It's go time, Goober.

06:46.279 --> 06:47.587
I'm not going to fight you.

06:47.963 --> 06:49.108
Oh Chicken,

06:50.210 --> 06:52.050
Make you think of the farm, farm boy?

06:52.278 --> 06:53.645
- That's it!
- Stop!

06:53.846 --> 06:56.090
Roland, quit it and get off the table.

06:56.803 --> 06:58.384
Sabrina, what's going on?

06:58.385 --> 07:00.928
It's a funny story. I'll tell you about it later.

07:01.955 --> 07:03.689
Come on. Come on.

07:04.924 --> 07:06.370
I think you could have taken him.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.160
That was surreal.

07:08.161 --> 07:10.092
I have no idea what just happened.

07:10.230 --> 07:11.524
Oh, it's the curse.

07:11.631 --> 07:13.873
I'm afraid you and Sabrina are going down.

07:14.570 --> 07:17.096
Why did we have to be so cute?

07:18.741 --> 07:21.575
Now get in there and no more fights,
do you understand?

07:21.608 --> 07:24.709
Okay! Okay! Henpecked already...

07:25.678 --> 07:27.279
and I love it.

07:28.920 --> 07:30.149
I'm exhausted.

07:30.350 --> 07:31.959
D'you mind if I make myself comfortable?

07:31.951 --> 07:33.751
So she did say troll.

07:34.954 --> 07:36.004
What's he doing here?

07:36.289 --> 07:37.723
I'll tell you in the kitchen.

07:37.724 --> 07:39.592
Go! Go!

07:57.877 --> 07:59.411
So what do I do now?

07:59.512 --> 08:00.979
We'd better call a lawyer,

08:00.980 --> 08:02.448
this contract looks authentic.

08:02.449 --> 08:03.982
Do you know any troll specialists?

08:04.283 --> 08:06.304
We'll look one up in the purple pages.

08:09.055 --> 08:10.189
Stuart Clarkson here.

08:10.190 --> 08:11.557
You have a legal emergency?

08:11.758 --> 08:13.884
A troll has asked for my hand in marriage.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.096
- Did you sign a contract?
- Yes.

08:16.396 --> 08:17.610
- Did you read the contract?
- No.

08:17.897 --> 08:19.544
- Have a nice wedding.
- Wait!

08:19.632 --> 08:21.318
You can't go, you have to help us.

08:21.568 --> 08:23.943
But you're asking me to break
a legitimate contract.

08:24.078 --> 08:25.887
Isn't that what lawyers do?

08:26.105 --> 08:27.573
Right!

08:27.774 --> 08:28.762
Where's the paperwork.

08:29.442 --> 08:31.744
Hopeless.
Hopeless.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.412
I am not getting married!

08:33.413 --> 08:34.630
According to this, you are.

08:34.664 --> 08:36.214
- Oh no!
- What?

08:36.448 --> 08:39.254
Ah, sorry. Misread a word, it's dearth, not death.

08:40.078 --> 08:42.589
Oh man, I am sweating up a storm.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.946
Do you mind if I take off
my jacket and pants?

08:44.981 --> 08:46.709
- You pants?
- Yes. Well don't worry,

08:46.744 --> 08:48.208
I'm wearing a four piece suit.

08:51.130 --> 08:52.531
- Hey.
- Harvey!

08:52.532 --> 08:54.900
You left in kind of a hurry.
Can I come in and talk?

08:56.202 --> 08:59.371
No. Erm, why don't we just step outside?

09:01.875 --> 09:03.975
Oh this is nice, the great outdoors.

09:04.077 --> 09:05.833
So, what did you want to talk about?

09:05.845 --> 09:08.090
Who was that guy who tried to
beat me up at school today?

09:08.248 --> 09:11.618
Roland, Oh that's a funny story,
I'll tell you later.

09:11.853 --> 09:13.018
It is later.

09:13.461 --> 09:15.716
Well... he's a friend of my aunts.

09:16.256 --> 09:17.781
That's the funny story?

09:18.216 --> 09:19.572
I didn't tell it very well.

09:19.759 --> 09:21.729
Why do I feel like you're
keeping something from me?

09:21.964 --> 09:23.952
I can't really talk about it, it's too weird.

09:24.130 --> 09:25.697
Sabrina, I'm your boyfriend.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.679
Do you want us to keep secrets from each other?

09:27.731 --> 09:28.767
No.

09:28.768 --> 09:30.880
So can you tell me who Roland is?

09:30.915 --> 09:33.437
- No.
- Okay, I'm out o' here.

09:33.771 --> 09:34.705
Harvey.

09:39.834 --> 09:40.770
Roland.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.307
- Roland!
- Glee-club!

09:45.018 --> 09:46.345
Roland can I talk to you?

09:46.781 --> 09:47.799
Of course.

09:48.154 --> 09:50.562
Communication is the foundation of any marriage.

09:50.597 --> 09:51.910
I'm not marrying you.

09:52.145 --> 09:54.298
Sorry, I didn't hear you.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.180
I'M NOT MARRYING YOU.

09:56.729 --> 09:58.096
Look, I'm very flattered

09:58.097 --> 09:59.898
that you chose me over a clock radio

09:59.899 --> 10:01.900
but this is not my idea of romance.

10:01.901 --> 10:03.435
- And farm boy is?
- Yes,

10:03.436 --> 10:05.524
Harvey and I happen to
be an award winning couple

10:05.559 --> 10:07.099
and even though we're fighting now...

10:07.100 --> 10:08.100
You are?

10:08.101 --> 10:10.887
We'll work it out because Harvey and I
were meant to be together.

10:10.922 --> 10:13.046
So my love goes unrequited?

10:13.813 --> 10:16.836
I guess there's no reason for me
to carry on this charade.

10:18.084 --> 10:20.793
You still deserve your
fee for finding my notes.

10:20.828 --> 10:22.627
- D'you want that clock radio?
- No.

10:23.490 --> 10:24.661
Can I say something?

10:25.171 --> 10:26.994
I've found a lot of things in my life,

10:27.694 --> 10:28.916
but I guess

10:29.096 --> 10:30.861
I'm still looking for love.

10:33.199 --> 10:34.495
Goodbye.

10:36.403 --> 10:38.107
What did you do to him?

10:38.142 --> 10:39.204
Nothing, I just...

10:39.900 --> 10:41.296
Look he left his hat.

10:41.297 --> 10:42.408
You'd better take it to him,

10:42.409 --> 10:44.783
- it completes his outfit.
- I'll be right back

10:44.918 --> 10:46.011
See ya.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.168
Hello!, Roland?

10:56.956 --> 10:58.351
What do you want?

10:58.486 --> 10:59.558
You forgot your hat.

10:59.759 --> 11:00.793
Who cares!

11:00.794 --> 11:03.121
Look, I'm sorry things didn't
work out the way you planned.

11:04.531 --> 11:06.158
Well, I gotta go study.

11:09.150 --> 11:10.075
It's stuck!

11:10.210 --> 11:11.934
No. It's locked,

11:11.969 --> 11:13.363
and you're trapped in here forever.

11:13.373 --> 11:14.406
You tricked me!

11:14.773 --> 11:18.072
Sabrina, I'm a finder, not a loser.

11:19.560 --> 11:20.813
Oh no!

11:27.253 --> 11:29.775
- So, when should we have the wedding?
- Never!

11:29.889 --> 11:31.574
I think June would be better.

11:31.825 --> 11:33.367
You can't keep me here.

11:33.502 --> 11:34.860
Oh yes I can.

11:34.861 --> 11:36.335
Faster! Faster!

11:36.336 --> 11:39.194
Please, I am dealing with
some incredibly big words.

11:39.332 --> 11:41.299
Guys, Sabrina went to return Roland's hat

11:41.300 --> 11:43.435
an hour ago and she hasn't come back yet.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.918
Oh no! That old troll trick.

11:46.006 --> 11:48.271
And it's perfectly legal.

11:48.975 --> 11:51.616
It took me two days but
I found that needle in a hay stack.

11:51.678 --> 11:53.454
Don't you ever talk about anything but work?

11:54.814 --> 11:56.279
That must be the wedding co-ordinator.

11:59.185 --> 12:01.350
My aunts! You've come to rescue me?

12:01.385 --> 12:03.922
Actually no, but we're working on getting you out.

12:03.990 --> 12:06.426
Good luck. It's an iron clad contract.

12:06.461 --> 12:09.106
Yes, but we have a lawyer with... great legs.

12:09.329 --> 12:11.947
And in the mean time we've
brought Sabrina her school books.

12:12.082 --> 12:15.437
Whoo-hoo. I'm engaged to
a troll and I get to study for finals.

12:15.672 --> 12:17.369
Okay, visiting hours are over.

12:17.370 --> 12:18.504
Once we're family

12:18.505 --> 12:20.641
you'll be welcome in my house anytime,

12:20.676 --> 12:22.623
but for now vamoose.

12:23.543 --> 12:24.576
Don't worry.

12:25.344 --> 12:26.412
We'll get you out.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.710
Before Friday or I'll fail biology.

12:30.016 --> 12:32.555
Forget homework, you're my princess now.

12:35.889 --> 12:37.478
I can dress myself.

12:38.258 --> 12:41.360
Hopeless. Hopeless.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.232
- Ho. Ho! Buried clause.
- Is that good?

12:44.267 --> 12:45.831
The party of the first part may be rescued

12:45.832 --> 12:47.645
by a prince she desires.

12:47.701 --> 12:48.867
Ha, ha. This may be the way out.

12:48.868 --> 12:50.302
That's great!

12:50.303 --> 12:51.655
Do we know any princes?

12:51.690 --> 12:53.257
Ney! I'll set up some interviews.

12:53.506 --> 12:56.086
On your special skills it says wall climbing?

12:56.276 --> 12:57.376
Oh that's old.

12:57.377 --> 12:58.610
What about Dragon slaying?

12:58.611 --> 12:59.712
Haven't done it in years.

12:59.713 --> 13:02.247
Look, I know I've let myself go

13:02.248 --> 13:04.424
but I think I can handle a troll.

13:05.418 --> 13:06.712
Do I smell pie?

13:07.921 --> 13:10.589
Look, I know twelve different
ways of killing you both

13:10.590 --> 13:12.157
without leaving my chair.

13:12.158 --> 13:13.292
So when do I start?

13:13.493 --> 13:15.994
Isis, you are our most qualified applicant

13:15.995 --> 13:17.496
but we still can't use you.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.097
It's because I'm a woman isn't it?

13:19.099 --> 13:20.199
Well yes.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.433
That makes me so..

13:22.869 --> 13:26.075
No. I'm going to save this
anger for my support group.

13:27.006 --> 13:28.433
Do you want some juice?

13:28.975 --> 13:30.709
Okay. We're looking for a prince

13:30.710 --> 13:32.503
to save our niece from a troll.

13:32.827 --> 13:34.413
It could involve some sword play

13:34.414 --> 13:36.982
and there's no guarantee
that you'll come back alive.

13:37.183 --> 13:39.579
I don't wanna die

13:40.320 --> 13:41.520
Don't cry.

13:41.521 --> 13:42.554
Do you want your mom?

13:42.555 --> 13:43.849
Should we get the Queen?

13:46.026 --> 13:47.558
Hi. Is Sabrina home?

13:47.593 --> 13:49.286
Oh no. I'm sorry.

13:49.295 --> 13:50.295
Me too.

13:50.296 --> 13:51.463
Well when you see her

13:51.464 --> 13:53.298
could you tell her that I've thought about it

13:53.299 --> 13:54.333
and I'm willing to accept

13:54.334 --> 13:56.592
whatever weird situation she's in.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.695
That's all, see ya.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.340
Harvey!

14:01.541 --> 14:03.542
Would you come in for a moment?

14:03.643 --> 14:04.843
Sure.

14:06.713 --> 14:09.040
I couldn't help but notice your jacket.

14:09.783 --> 14:11.628
Who is the Termite King?

14:12.218 --> 14:14.394
My Dad. That's his company.

14:14.654 --> 14:16.912
Which would make you the Termite Prince.

14:16.947 --> 14:19.332
And that's why I'm leaving
the area when I go to college.

14:19.759 --> 14:21.326
Will you excuse me.

14:21.327 --> 14:22.461
There's hope!

14:22.562 --> 14:25.059
The Termite Prince will stand up in a court of troll.

14:25.094 --> 14:25.898
-Yes!
- Yes!

14:26.099 --> 14:27.684
Only problem is, Harvey's mortal.

14:27.901 --> 14:29.814
Do we have the fixings for a memory loss potion?

14:30.003 --> 14:31.138
Do we!

14:31.871 --> 14:36.909
I see you two in a gazebo draped in wisteria.

14:36.910 --> 14:38.410
I'm loving it.

14:38.411 --> 14:41.744
With garlands in her hair, and yours

14:42.109 --> 14:43.390
Divine.

14:44.551 --> 14:45.484
I have an idea.

14:45.485 --> 14:46.843
Why don't you two get married?

14:48.021 --> 14:50.216
I see the bride has a case of cold feet.

14:50.251 --> 14:53.083
Oh poor Sabrina.

14:54.361 --> 14:56.829
Maybe I shouldn't put you
through all the stress of this.

14:56.830 --> 14:58.422
- You mean...?
- Yes,

14:58.754 --> 15:00.212
let's move the wedding up to tomorrow.

15:00.500 --> 15:01.754
Tomorrow!

15:01.801 --> 15:05.143
Somebody help me.
HELP!

15:08.556 --> 15:09.412
Hmm. Cinnamony.

15:09.509 --> 15:11.655
What we're about to tell you is strange,

15:11.690 --> 15:13.618
so I hope you can accept it.

15:13.653 --> 15:16.242
I'm drinking from a chalice
in front of a guy with no pants,

15:16.649 --> 15:19.458
I'm trying. So what's the truth?

15:19.652 --> 15:21.796
Sabrina's a witch and she's
being held captive by a troll

15:21.831 --> 15:23.222
in his castle

15:23.223 --> 15:25.167
and only a prince who she loves can save her.

15:25.944 --> 15:27.153
That's all?

15:29.295 --> 15:32.105
So the quest starts with me
going through the linen closet?

15:32.432 --> 15:35.136
Yes. Wait, your clothes are all wrong.

15:37.465 --> 15:39.711
I don't have to dress like this forever do I?

15:39.746 --> 15:42.384
No. Just until you vanquish the troll.

15:42.419 --> 15:44.266
I couldn't vanquish the troll in pants?

15:51.284 --> 15:54.026
Sabrina?
Sabrina?

15:54.061 --> 15:55.375
Harvey?

15:56.623 --> 15:57.662
Sabrina?

15:58.491 --> 15:59.625
Harvey!

15:59.626 --> 16:00.684
How's it goin'?

16:00.927 --> 16:02.164
What are you doing here?

16:02.399 --> 16:04.467
I'm supposed to vanquish the troll.

16:04.864 --> 16:05.798
Oh, come on up.

16:06.049 --> 16:07.938
I can't, the doors locked.

16:08.469 --> 16:11.901
There must be a way.
We have to think fairy tale.

16:12.872 --> 16:14.506
I've got it!

16:28.011 --> 16:30.123
Harvey, climb up my hair.

16:30.400 --> 16:31.457
You're okay with that?

16:31.458 --> 16:33.225
Yeah, just don't split any ends.

16:45.705 --> 16:46.924
Hurry up

16:48.241 --> 16:49.508
I made it.

16:49.609 --> 16:50.966
My Prince has come.

16:51.444 --> 16:52.845
You look great with long hair.

16:53.114 --> 16:54.222
Na, it's a lot of up keep.

16:57.083 --> 16:58.784
Let me look at you.

16:58.785 --> 17:01.564
So, I guess this means
you know how weird my life is.

17:01.688 --> 17:02.893
Your aunts told me.

17:02.928 --> 17:04.566
I figured as much when I saw you in tights.

17:05.137 --> 17:06.483
They're kinda bunching on me.

17:06.759 --> 17:09.393
Sweetheart, look what the Billy Goat sent us.

17:09.561 --> 17:10.857
Quick, hide.

17:12.332 --> 17:13.768
I've got to get rid of this hair.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.392
It's a blender.

17:20.406 --> 17:22.403
What's he doing here?

17:24.810 --> 17:26.384
Oh right, you're good at finding things.

17:27.247 --> 17:28.582
Where's my sword?

17:29.048 --> 17:30.576
Where's my sword?

17:32.385 --> 17:33.619
Ha, ha! found it.

17:33.620 --> 17:35.039
Sabrina, what do I do?

17:35.055 --> 17:36.285
Draw your sword.

17:37.357 --> 17:39.033
- Now what do I do?
- Use it!

17:59.646 --> 18:01.547
Take that!

18:01.548 --> 18:03.048
Take it back!

18:03.426 --> 18:04.216
Watch out!

18:07.354 --> 18:08.937
Ah! Time out! Time out!

18:12.525 --> 18:13.525
Time in.

18:20.433 --> 18:21.367
Where'd he go?

18:21.368 --> 18:22.901
To your left!

18:23.051 --> 18:24.967
Over here, farm boy.

18:25.102 --> 18:26.485
I hate that name.

18:33.152 --> 18:35.268
Don't worry Harvey,
here comes the air support.

18:38.418 --> 18:40.486
Honey, that almost hit me.

18:42.989 --> 18:43.989
Whaddya doin'?

18:45.425 --> 18:47.472
Hey, I'm duelling down here.

18:56.336 --> 18:59.843
You've taken your last breath.

18:59.873 --> 19:01.148
My aim is true.

19:04.301 --> 19:05.381
Bulls eye,

19:05.616 --> 19:08.357
and to think I complained about
lugging that around all year.

19:09.449 --> 19:11.391
Harvey?
Harvey.

19:13.693 --> 19:14.804
What happened?

19:15.588 --> 19:17.616
Sabrina, did you do this to me?

19:17.757 --> 19:20.186
Sorry Roland, but consider
yourself vanquished.

19:20.896 --> 19:23.020
You're a very complicated woman

19:23.055 --> 19:24.963
and more trouble than you're worth.

19:25.064 --> 19:26.865
The marriage is off

19:26.866 --> 19:29.189
and if anyone asks, I dumped you.

19:30.779 --> 19:31.470
We did it.

19:31.471 --> 19:32.508
Let's frolic.

19:44.451 --> 19:46.124
Wait! What day is it?

19:46.432 --> 19:47.490
Thursday?

19:47.525 --> 19:48.821
We've got our biology test tomorrow,

19:48.822 --> 19:50.689
we've gotta study. Move it!

19:55.362 --> 19:56.933
Sabrina, you're back.

19:57.964 --> 20:00.375
Harvey saved me, and now he knows everything.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.879
Yep. Sabrina's a witch, you're a witch,

20:02.914 --> 20:04.036
your Sister's a witch,

20:04.037 --> 20:05.237
it all makes sense.

20:05.238 --> 20:06.814
But only for fifteen more seconds.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.410
Then the knowledge will be erased
from his memory forever.

20:09.576 --> 20:11.106
But I like it like this.

20:11.109 --> 20:12.444
We have no secrets from each other.

20:12.445 --> 20:15.542
Then for the next five seconds
you have a perfect relationship.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.495
That doesn't give me much time but..

20:18.588 --> 20:21.461
I always knew there was something
magical about you Sabrina,

20:21.755 --> 20:22.755
and now..

20:24.424 --> 20:25.624
What was I saying?

20:25.925 --> 20:28.373
You were telling me... what mitosis is.

20:29.011 --> 20:30.262
Right..

20:30.658 --> 20:31.930
What is it?

20:34.234 --> 20:35.367
And initial here.

20:36.970 --> 20:38.538
I found this pen you know.

20:38.938 --> 20:41.300
Sabrina is now free and clear
to marry whoever she wants.

20:41.301 --> 20:43.771
In return you are entitled to her clock radio.

20:43.877 --> 20:46.281
I didn't really want it, I just took it to hurt her.

20:51.184 --> 20:52.480
It's the first day of finals.

20:52.515 --> 20:53.846
What are you two doing holding hands?

20:53.920 --> 20:55.954
- We survived the curse.
- How?

20:56.122 --> 20:58.412
It's a funny story. I'll tell you about it later.

21:00.627 --> 21:01.934
You have fifty minutes.

21:01.969 --> 21:05.117
Don't start until everyone has a test.

21:05.265 --> 21:07.815
- Sabrina, good luck
- You too,

21:07.934 --> 21:09.201
and don't forget. Mitosis is..

21:09.202 --> 21:10.202
You may begin.

21:10.203 --> 21:11.550
The process of cell division.

21:14.779 --> 21:17.774
*We Dedicate This Season To The Memory Of
Barry Marz, a Great Writer And Friend.*

21:21.414 --> 21:23.311
Sabrina, we have a surprize!

21:23.483 --> 21:25.270
Since you did so well on your finals,

21:25.305 --> 21:26.776
we think you deserve a reward.

21:26.853 --> 21:28.186
I've been thinking that too.

21:28.221 --> 21:29.688
So, where are we going?

21:29.789 --> 21:30.689
Tony Roma's

21:30.790 --> 21:31.845
No.

21:32.906 --> 21:33.926
What's going on?

21:33.927 --> 21:35.327
It's an around the world tour

21:35.328 --> 21:37.722
available only to witches who ace biology.

21:37.757 --> 21:38.961
And their relatives.

21:38.996 --> 21:40.384
First stop Spain.

21:40.606 --> 21:41.667
Ole!

21:42.268 --> 21:45.366
They left me behind! Be strong, don't cry

21:48.157 --> 21:49.842
I can't believe we almost forgot you.

21:49.900 --> 21:51.220
What, had you left?

21:51.244 --> 21:53.458
Yes. Anyway we have
to catch up with the others.

21:53.493 --> 21:54.561
Ole!

21:55.359 --> 21:57.488
