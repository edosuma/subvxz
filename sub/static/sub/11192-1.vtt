00:44.399 --> 00:47.335
Queen to the king,
possible straight going there.

00:47.280 --> 00:50.545
Eight on the eight.
And the jack gets a boss.

00:51.918 --> 00:53.442
Eights open.

00:55.758 --> 00:58.851
Aren't you guys afraid of an officer
coming down here or something?

00:58.798 --> 01:01.767
Trust me.
Nobody ever comes down here but us.

01:04.683 --> 01:06.981
- That thing always do that?
- Do what?

01:06.956 --> 01:09.117
Whatever that thing is under the tarp.

01:09.099 --> 01:11.364
I thought I just saw it move,
or do something...

01:11.340 --> 01:14.638
Probably the only thing
it ever did was cost money.

01:14.731 --> 01:17.063
I'm telling you, the thing is moving!

01:17.033 --> 01:19.798
If you don't have the straight, just fold.

01:22.409 --> 01:23.740
(RUMBLING)

01:52.004 --> 01:53.768
What are you doing?

02:29.502 --> 02:31.061

03:36.466 --> 03:38.901

03:41.009 --> 03:42.772
Go, go, go! Move it!

04:03.822 --> 04:05.346
Hold your fire!

04:58.213 --> 05:00.942
SOLDIER: I thought I saw someone on
the roof when we came up the drive, sir.

05:00.901 --> 05:03.028
There's a ladder over there.

05:14.978 --> 05:17.776
- Colonel Jack O'Neill?
- Retired.

05:18.112 --> 05:19.740
I'm Major Samuels.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.595
Want a little piece of advice, Major?

05:23.136 --> 05:26.935
Get re-assed to NASA.
That's where all the action's gonna be.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.331
Out there.

05:31.423 --> 05:35.086
I'm... I'm under orders to bring you
to see General Hammond, sir.

05:35.005 --> 05:38.338
- Never heard of him.
- He replaced General West.

05:38.269 --> 05:41.238
- I'm a busy man, Major.
- I can see that, sir.

05:41.502 --> 05:43.435
He says it's important.

05:43.548 --> 05:45.675
Has to do with the stargate.

06:34.612 --> 06:36.774
We have to take a second elevator
the rest of the way, sir.

06:36.755 --> 06:38.586
It's a long way down.

06:38.803 --> 06:42.069
Yeah, I know. I've been here before.

06:42.802 --> 06:44.293
Of course.

06:59.375 --> 07:00.865
This way, sir.

07:14.158 --> 07:15.182
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

07:15.213 --> 07:16.339
Come.

07:16.651 --> 07:19.314
General Hammond, Colonel Jack O'Neill.

07:19.660 --> 07:20.922
Retired.

07:21.867 --> 07:24.393
I can see that. I envy you, Colonel.

07:25.292 --> 07:28.158
Major Samuels mentioned something
about the stargate.

07:28.106 --> 07:31.598
Down to business. I can do that.
This way...

07:40.617 --> 07:42.608
HAMMOND: Anyone you know, Colonel?

07:42.793 --> 07:44.487
DOCTOR: They're not human.

07:44.744 --> 07:46.074
You think?

07:47.303 --> 07:49.863
Best we can tell,
these slits are actually a pouch,

07:49.831 --> 07:52.062
similar to that found in a marsupial.

07:52.038 --> 07:53.630
- Like a kangaroo.
- Mmm.

07:54.406 --> 07:55.668
Except...

08:01.382 --> 08:02.906
In both sexes.

08:03.588 --> 08:07.081
These people, or aliens,
whatever you wanna call them,

08:07.012 --> 08:10.276
came through, killed four of my people

08:10.211 --> 08:13.237
and kidnapped another,
using advanced weapons.

08:13.668 --> 08:14.862
Airman?

08:15.105 --> 08:16.367
Weapons?

08:27.680 --> 08:29.773
Seen one before, I take it?

08:30.369 --> 08:31.630
Yes, sir.

08:32.510 --> 08:34.446
But there are no creatures like this
on Abydos.

08:34.432 --> 08:37.423
Those people were human.
They were from Earth.

08:37.375 --> 08:39.399
Ra brought 'em there
thousands of years ago.

08:39.390 --> 08:41.289
I know all about that.

08:41.759 --> 08:45.091
But your report said this Ra was in fact

08:45.022 --> 08:47.751
some kind of alien that lived
inside a human body.

08:47.709 --> 08:50.438
His eyes glowed. That was our first clue.

08:54.172 --> 08:56.538
Are you sure he's dead, Colonel?

08:57.755 --> 09:00.019
Unless he could survive a tactical
nuclear warhead

08:59.995 --> 09:03.488
blowing up in his face, I'm positive. Why?

09:03.961 --> 09:08.091
Well, Colonel, these people,
or whatever they are,

09:07.994 --> 09:12.054
were guarding another man
who retreated back through the stargate.

09:12.153 --> 09:15.645
I got a good look at his eyes, Colonel.
They glowed.

09:22.135 --> 09:25.572
How do you feel about the Stargate
mission after all this time, Colonel?

09:25.495 --> 09:26.927
How do you mean?

09:26.934 --> 09:29.596
Well, it's been over a year.
Has your perspective changed?

09:29.557 --> 09:31.115
Well, sir, I...

09:38.229 --> 09:40.890
- Was that...
- HAMMOND: Kawalsky and Ferretti? Yes.

09:41.011 --> 09:43.809
Served under your command
on the first Stargate mission.

09:43.764 --> 09:45.595
Have a seat, Colonel.

09:51.889 --> 09:54.653
Tell me about Daniel Jackson, Colonel.

09:54.706 --> 09:56.971
Why are they questioning my men?

09:56.945 --> 09:59.913
They're not your men anymore, Colonel.
You retired.

09:59.857 --> 10:01.450
Daniel Jackson?

10:03.759 --> 10:05.489
- You read the report?
- Yes.

10:05.488 --> 10:07.388
- It's all there.
- Is it?

10:10.191 --> 10:12.182
What's this all about, General?

10:12.174 --> 10:14.643
You didn't like Daniel Jackson, did you?

10:14.606 --> 10:16.575
Basically, he was a geek, sir.

10:16.557 --> 10:18.184
So you didn't have a lot of time for him?

10:18.190 --> 10:19.850
I didn't say that.

10:20.110 --> 10:22.840
He also saved my life and found
the way home for my men and me.

10:22.798 --> 10:25.265
A little thing like that can kind of
make a person grow on you.

10:25.229 --> 10:26.456
HAMMOND: According to the mission brief,

10:26.476 --> 10:28.911
your orders were to
go through the stargate,

10:28.875 --> 10:33.711
to detect any possible threat to Earth,
and if found, to detonate a nuclear device

10:33.580 --> 10:35.514
and destroy the gate on the other side.

10:35.499 --> 10:36.523
Yes.

10:36.553 --> 10:38.851
SAMUELS: But that's
not what you did, is it?

10:38.826 --> 10:40.384
Not right away.

10:40.586 --> 10:45.148
Ra's forces overpowered my team
and took the weapon before I could arm it.

10:45.577 --> 10:48.046
But, with Dr. Jackson's help,
you eventually regained control,

10:48.009 --> 10:50.807
- and did, in fact, detonate the weapon?
- Yes.

10:50.759 --> 10:54.217
So, to the best of your knowledge,
Daniel Jackson and everyone else

10:54.152 --> 10:56.711
you knew on Abydos is dead, correct?

10:57.479 --> 10:58.969
That's correct.

10:58.982 --> 11:00.075
Good.

11:00.230 --> 11:03.894
Then you won't mind if I authorize
a go-ahead on our plan.

11:10.277 --> 11:14.269
HAMMOND: This quartz material
the stargates are made of,

11:14.179 --> 11:17.149
it must be tough stuff
if it can withstand a Mark 3.

11:17.091 --> 11:20.061
Well, we sent a robot probe through
after we got back, sir.

11:20.003 --> 11:22.062
It was flattened on the other end.

11:22.051 --> 11:25.850
Obviously, the Abydos stargate
had been buried in the rubble.

11:26.114 --> 11:28.308
HAMMOND: But somehow, it got unburied.

11:34.209 --> 11:35.607
Oh, my God!

11:38.144 --> 11:39.441
You're sending another bomb?

11:39.456 --> 11:41.219
A Mark 5 this time.

11:43.456 --> 11:45.980
Unless you have something to add.

11:54.878 --> 11:56.709
General Hammond, sir.

12:00.188 --> 12:04.148
I regret to inform you that my report
was not entirely accurate.

12:04.250 --> 12:05.581
You didn't detonate the bomb.

12:05.596 --> 12:08.894
I did detonate the bomb, sir,
and it was aboard Ra's spacecraft,

12:08.826 --> 12:11.226
so it did kill him
and eliminate the risk to Earth.

12:11.195 --> 12:13.095
- However...
- However...

12:17.018 --> 12:20.350
Ra's ship was in orbit
above the planet at the time.

12:21.240 --> 12:25.143
Neither the gate nor anything else
on the planet was destroyed.

12:26.552 --> 12:29.316
Daniel Jackson is alive
and living with the people on Abydos.

12:29.272 --> 12:31.102
You violated direct orders. Why?

12:31.096 --> 12:32.893
Because the people of Abydos
are no threat to us.

12:32.886 --> 12:34.013
They deserve to be left alone.

12:34.038 --> 12:35.528
That's not up to you...

12:35.543 --> 12:38.706
If I'd come back here and reported the gate
on the other side was still intact,

12:38.645 --> 12:41.307
we would've sent another bomb,
just like you were about to.

12:41.269 --> 12:43.397
It wasn't necessary to let those people die.

12:43.381 --> 12:44.974
The threat from Ra was gone.

12:44.980 --> 12:48.109
What about the probe we sent through?
It was crushed instantly.

12:48.052 --> 12:50.713
After we came home,
Daniel buried the gate in rocks,

12:50.676 --> 12:53.701
making my return
or anybody else's impossible.

12:54.036 --> 12:57.494
Those four bodies lying in the infirmary
say otherwise.

13:00.498 --> 13:02.294
Take Colonel O'Neill to the holding room.

13:02.289 --> 13:06.283
Give him a little time to think about
things while I decide what to do with him.

13:07.249 --> 13:08.614
Sergeant.

13:26.286 --> 13:28.082
Colonel O'Neill, sir.

13:28.205 --> 13:30.934
I'm retired, Kawalsky. Lose the salute.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.980
Me and Ferretti didn't tell them anything.

13:38.443 --> 13:40.071
I appreciate that.

13:40.075 --> 13:42.975
Hey, those kids on Abydos
saved my life, too.

13:44.202 --> 13:46.033
Yeah. Those kids...

13:47.786 --> 13:50.948
I mean, they're the whole reason
we kept it secret.

13:51.081 --> 13:52.241
Right?

13:54.184 --> 13:56.914
That one kid idolized you. Remember him?

13:57.960 --> 13:59.484
Weird name... What was it?

13:59.495 --> 14:00.724
Skaara.

14:01.447 --> 14:02.607
Right.

14:03.080 --> 14:05.809
Remember how he was
always saluting you?

14:05.894 --> 14:06.986
Yeah.

14:07.815 --> 14:10.648
My kid used to do that when he was little.

14:11.813 --> 14:14.145
Skaara kind of reminded me of him.

14:22.820 --> 14:25.549
How many people did you say
are on Abydos?

14:25.506 --> 14:27.941
That we saw? Maybe 5,000.

14:34.722 --> 14:37.624
Does this mean you're reconsidering
sending the bomb, sir?

14:37.570 --> 14:39.970
It means I'm open to suggestions.

14:41.345 --> 14:44.836
General, let me take a team
through that gate.

14:45.441 --> 14:46.931
We'll find out who those aliens are.

14:46.945 --> 14:49.243
Kawalsky and I have been there before.
We know the lay of the land.

14:49.216 --> 14:50.205
We know the people.

14:50.240 --> 14:52.538
You think you know them.
Jackson could be dead.

14:52.511 --> 14:53.842
You don't know
what you'd be walking into.

14:53.855 --> 14:56.221
There is one way to find out, sir.

14:56.191 --> 14:58.818
We'll have the prototype probe
shipped from MIT.

14:58.782 --> 15:01.615
No, sir. We don't need that probe.

15:02.302 --> 15:04.462
- We don't?
- Nope. This'll do.

15:13.628 --> 15:15.424
MAN ON PA: Chevron one encoded

15:24.217 --> 15:25.980
Chevron two encoded.

15:27.352 --> 15:29.253
Care to explain this concept?

15:29.241 --> 15:30.731
MAN: Chevron three encoded.

15:30.745 --> 15:32.610
Jackson has allergies.

15:33.399 --> 15:34.662
I get it.

15:35.447 --> 15:36.880
Chevron four encoded.

15:36.886 --> 15:40.254
He'll know this came from me
and not from someone like...

15:41.462 --> 15:42.725
Yourself.

15:44.438 --> 15:46.100
Chevron five encoded.

15:46.101 --> 15:47.899
Why not just send a note?

15:47.893 --> 15:49.793
- Anyone could send a note.
- Anyone could send a note.

15:58.421 --> 16:00.217
Chevron six encoded.

16:08.274 --> 16:10.072
Chevron seven locked.

16:45.421 --> 16:46.682
Now what?

16:46.923 --> 16:49.448
If Jackson's still around,
he'll know what the message means.

16:49.418 --> 16:51.477
What if the aliens got it?

16:51.466 --> 16:54.264
Well, they could be blowing
their noses right now.

16:54.217 --> 16:56.618
They could be planning an attack.

16:56.841 --> 17:00.333
Come on, Samuels.
Let me be the cynic around here, huh?

17:01.321 --> 17:03.812
General, this could take some time.

the President's authorization,

18:22.107 --> 18:24.337
the mission briefing will be at 0800 hours.

18:24.315 --> 18:27.579
Consider yourself recalled
to active duty, Colonel.

18:53.269 --> 18:55.328
Gentlemen, take your seats.

18:58.614 --> 18:59.773
Where's Captain Carter?

18:59.797 --> 19:01.320
Just arriving, sir.

19:01.333 --> 19:02.527
Carter?

19:02.676 --> 19:05.474
I'm assigning Sam Carter to this mission.

19:05.587 --> 19:07.953
I'd prefer to put together
my own team, sir.

19:07.923 --> 19:12.122
I'm sorry. Not on this mission.
Carter's our expert on the stargate.

19:13.137 --> 19:14.332
Where is he transferring from?

19:14.354 --> 19:16.981
CARTER: She is transferring
from the Pentagon.

19:20.306 --> 19:22.136
I take it you're Colonel O'Neill.

19:22.130 --> 19:24.859
Captain Samantha Carter reporting, sir.

19:27.311 --> 19:29.507
But, of course, you go by Sam.

19:29.489 --> 19:30.786
HAMMOND: Let's get started.

19:30.799 --> 19:32.563
- Colonel?
- All right.

19:33.135 --> 19:36.627
For those of you on your first trip
through the gate,

19:36.558 --> 19:38.423
you should be prepared
for what to expect.

19:38.413 --> 19:41.644
Well, I've practically memorized
your report from the first mission, sir.

19:41.582 --> 19:44.414
I'd like to think I've been
preparing for this all my life.

19:44.365 --> 19:45.992
I think what the Colonel is saying is,

19:45.998 --> 19:49.798
have you ever pulled out of a simulated
bombing run in an F-16 at eight-plus Gs?

19:49.709 --> 19:50.767
Yes.

19:53.644 --> 19:55.406
Well, it's way worse than that.

19:55.403 --> 19:58.394
By the time you get to the other side,
you're frozen stiff,

19:58.346 --> 20:00.247
like you've just been through a blizzard.

20:00.233 --> 20:02.531
That's a result of the compression
your molecules undergo

20:02.506 --> 20:04.736
during the millisecond required
for reconstitution.

I've just got a little problem
with scientists.

20:33.797 --> 20:38.233
Well, Colonel, I logged over 100 hours
in enemy airspace during the Gulf War.

20:38.115 --> 20:39.878
Is that tough enough for you?

20:39.876 --> 20:42.402
Or are we gonna have to arm wrestle?

20:48.961 --> 20:50.952
but I still say the safest
and most logical way

20:50.945 --> 20:54.244
is to bury the stargate,
just like the ancient Egyptians did,

20:54.177 --> 20:56.612

20:56.576 --> 20:58.977
It's the only way to eliminate the threat.

- It worked before.

got to Earth in the first place?

21:04.479 --> 21:05.537
Good question.

21:05.567 --> 21:07.365
They've got ships, General.

21:07.358 --> 21:10.088
Ra had one as big as the great pyramids.

21:10.046 --> 21:14.813
They don't need the stargate to get here.
They can do it the old-fashioned way.

21:14.845 --> 21:19.577
Now, with all due respect
to Mr. Glass-ls-Half-Empty over here,

21:19.452 --> 21:21.421
don't you think maybe
we should use the stargate

21:21.403 --> 21:25.396
to do a little reconnaissance
before they decide to show up again?

21:36.282 --> 21:41.016

return or send a message through.

Hi.

the stargate on Earth.

Four people are dead, one's missing.

25:47.567 --> 25:49.000

they didn't come from here.

25:51.951 --> 25:54.351
I mean, the boys take shifts guarding it,
36 hours a day, every day.

25:54.317 --> 25:56.945
We'd know if they came through here.

Well, they came from somewhere, Daniel.
I'm gonna have to look around.

till the sandstorm is over.

to know their million-dollar probe

26:36.038 --> 26:40.305

through the gate into our barricade,

he must've come through another gate.

- What other gate?
- Another stargate?

28:18.484 --> 28:21.817
- The stargate only goes here.
- No. No. I think you're wrong about that.

Actually, it's sort of a chart,
more of a map.

32:35.690 --> 32:36.849
A map?

32:38.729 --> 32:39.820

What's it a map of?

32:51.174 --> 32:53.972
JACKSON: Well, the cartouches seem to be
separated clearly into groupings.

32:53.926 --> 32:56.555
Each grouping is attached to the others
with a series of lines.

32:56.518 --> 32:58.644
And each grouping of glyphs
contain seven symbols.

32:58.631 --> 33:00.530
So you can see where
this is going, of course.

33:00.518 --> 33:02.748
Why don't you tell us anyway?

33:03.909 --> 33:06.502
All the symbols are on
the stargate in the Abydos chamber.

33:06.469 --> 33:09.801
I've also managed to chart
some of them in the Abydos night sky,

33:09.731 --> 33:11.757
or at least pretty close.

33:12.035 --> 33:16.938
I think that this is a map of
a vast network of stargates.

33:19.266 --> 33:21.700
I don't think that can be, Doctor.

33:22.721 --> 33:23.983
Why not?

33:24.481 --> 33:26.847
Well, because after Colonel O'Neill
and his team came back,

33:26.817 --> 33:28.842
my team ran hundreds
of symbol permutations,

33:28.833 --> 33:31.700
using Earth as the point of origin,
and it never worked.

anything about astrophysics,

33:39.423 --> 33:41.220
but couldn't the planets change?

33:41.214 --> 33:46.618

like that to throw this map off?

- Really?

33:50.653 --> 33:53.555
I mean... You mean, I'm right?

33:53.820 --> 33:55.117
CARTER: The galaxy is a vortex.

33:55.132 --> 33:57.895
All the stars are constantly moving
in relation to one another.

33:57.852 --> 33:59.786
So in the thousands of years
since the stargate was built...

33:59.771 --> 34:00.932
All the coordinates could've changed.

34:00.954 --> 34:03.252
But why does it still work
between Abydos and Earth?

34:03.227 --> 34:05.855
Well, Abydos is probably the closest
planet in the network to Earth.

34:05.818 --> 34:08.617
I mean, the closer they are, the less
the difference in relative position.

34:08.570 --> 34:10.663
The further away,
the greater the difference.

34:10.650 --> 34:13.346
In a few thousand more years, it won't
work between Earth and Abydos either.

34:13.306 --> 34:14.898
Unless you can adjust
for the displacement.

34:14.905 --> 34:17.500
Right. Now, with this map as a base,
that should be easy.

34:17.463 --> 34:19.898
All we have to do is correct
for stellar drift.

at a computer model

necessary to get the gate working again.

- Probably.

39:08.902 --> 39:11.929
And the only way we're gonna get 'em
back is for you to come home with us.

39:11.878 --> 39:14.402
Ferretti might have
seen those coordinates.

39:14.373 --> 39:16.467
I've got everything I need.

39:27.300 --> 39:28.824
(SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE)

39:39.489 --> 39:42.083
After we go through the chaapa 'ai,

39:42.048 --> 39:46.110
you have to bury it like we did before,
and then leave this place.

39:47.360 --> 39:49.123
- You come back?
- No.

39:50.239 --> 39:51.570
No, I can't. Nobody can.

39:51.583 --> 39:55.382
That's what I'm telling you.
Not for a long time.

39:56.094 --> 39:58.655
Now, as soon as we're gone,
I want you to close it. Bury it.

39:58.621 --> 40:00.851
Put a big, heavy cover stone over it.

40:00.829 --> 40:02.420
Nothing good can ever
come through this gate.

40:02.429 --> 40:04.090
Do you understand?

40:05.822 --> 40:08.052
You came through it, Daniel.

40:11.708 --> 40:14.302
Do you remember the story I told you?

40:15.259 --> 40:17.818
How the ancient Egyptians back on Earth
cut themselves off from Ra?

40:17.788 --> 40:20.621
Well, that is exactly what you have to do.

40:22.297 --> 40:25.563
Then, in one year, one year from this day,
you take the cover stone away.

40:25.498 --> 40:28.432
I will try to bring Sha're home
with me on that day.

40:28.376 --> 40:31.175
But if I don't make it back, if I don't...

40:31.128 --> 40:34.496
If I don't return, then you must
bury the gate again forever, joa qua?

40:37.974 --> 40:39.340
Promise me.

40:39.416 --> 40:40.610
- Yes.
- Yes.

40:41.494 --> 40:43.224
We promise, Daniel.

40:46.487 --> 40:49.251
You tell Sha're's father, in one year...

41:15.376 --> 41:18.869
MAN ON PA: Incoming wormhole
Stand by for arrival

41:40.876 --> 41:43.175
Close the iris! Close the iris!

41:54.987 --> 41:56.818
What the hell's that, sir?

41:56.811 --> 41:59.938
That's our insurance against
any more surprises.

42:04.072 --> 42:05.563
What happened, Colonel?

42:05.577 --> 42:08.204
Base camp was hit while
we were on recon, sir.

42:08.168 --> 42:11.001
Ferretti's hurt,
Currin and Swope are down.

42:11.047 --> 42:12.981
Same hostiles who attacked us?

42:12.967 --> 42:14.697
That's a fair guess.

42:14.695 --> 42:17.858
Jackson's wife and one of our kids
was kidnapped.

42:18.405 --> 42:20.498
General, hi. I'm Daniel Jackson.
We've never met.

42:20.485 --> 42:23.648
I'd like to be on the team
that goes after them.

42:23.588 --> 42:26.887
You're not in any position
to make demands, Jackson.

42:33.733 --> 42:35.360
CARTER: Ferretti might have seen
the sequence of symbols

42:35.364 --> 42:37.025
they used to go through the stargate.

42:37.027 --> 42:39.257
That should tell us where they went.

42:39.235 --> 42:43.137
General, Dr. Jackson found
an entire cartouche on Abydos

42:43.041 --> 42:45.943
with 1,000 possible coordinates,
maybe more.

42:46.306 --> 42:48.206
That's 1,000 new worlds, General.

42:48.193 --> 42:50.889
And our stargate can take us
to these worlds?

42:50.849 --> 42:53.545
With this new data, as long as we make
the appropriate allowances

42:53.505 --> 42:54.903
for alignment in the targeting computer...

42:54.911 --> 42:56.208
Yes or no?

42:56.992 --> 42:58.822
I think so, sir. Yes.

42:58.880 --> 43:02.338
Request permission to upload the symbols
into the base supercomputer for analysis.

43:02.271 --> 43:06.001
And, sir, I'd like to lead the rescue mission
once we find out where these hostiles are.

43:05.918 --> 43:09.184
We'll discuss that request in a briefing
at 0800 hours.

43:09.117 --> 43:11.847
Captain Carter, the base computer
is at your disposal.

43:11.804 --> 43:15.605
In the meantime, get this man
some clean clothing. He stinks.

43:55.893 --> 43:57.452
(SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE)

44:05.844 --> 44:07.936
Your death cannot help her.

44:09.684 --> 44:11.583
I am not afraid of you!

44:23.153 --> 44:24.552
(SHOUTING)

44:31.311 --> 44:32.300
No!

44:50.668 --> 44:52.795
Doc says he's gonna make it.

44:54.795 --> 44:56.056
Yes, sir.

44:58.539 --> 45:01.235
- You gonna stay here all night?
- Yes, sir.

45:21.864 --> 45:22.956
Hey.

45:25.990 --> 45:28.481
They don't know what to do with me.

45:28.869 --> 45:31.599
And I don't know what to do with myself.

45:35.750 --> 45:37.911
Come on. Let's get out of here.

45:55.681 --> 45:56.909
(JACKSON SNEEZING)

45:57.601 --> 45:59.228
- Nice catch.
- Thank you.

45:59.233 --> 46:02.690
Sorry. Gate travel always seems
to make my allergies...

46:08.255 --> 46:10.918
- Sorry.
- So, you were saying...

46:10.974 --> 46:12.463
Anyway...

46:13.405 --> 46:15.032
As soon as you were gone
and they realized they were free,

46:15.038 --> 46:18.405
I mean, Abydos was
their world for the taking.

46:19.132 --> 46:23.001
- Had a little party, did you?
- Yeah. Yeah, big, big party.

46:23.197 --> 46:27.896
They treated me like their savior.
It was embarrassing.

46:28.443 --> 46:31.038
Savior of Abydos? Doesn't sound so bad.

46:31.003 --> 46:34.871
Yeah, I spent the first year having to stop
everyone I saw from bowing all the time.

46:34.778 --> 46:36.838
It's amazing you turned out so normal.

46:36.827 --> 46:39.762
Well, if it wasn't for Sha're, I probably...

46:45.625 --> 46:47.286
She was the complete opposite
of everyone else.

46:47.289 --> 46:49.382
She practically fell on the floor
laughing every time

46:49.367 --> 46:52.336
I tried to do some chore
they all took for granted.

46:52.280 --> 46:55.271
Like, grinding yaphetta flour.

46:56.503 --> 46:59.835
I mean, have you ever tried
to grind your own flour?

47:00.054 --> 47:02.579
I'm trying to kick the flour thing.

47:03.702 --> 47:06.170
This is going straight to my head.

47:07.413 --> 47:09.847
What time is it anyway?
I must have gate-lag or something.

47:09.813 --> 47:12.907
Daniel, for crying out loud,
you've had one beer.

47:12.851 --> 47:14.443
You're a cheaper date than my wife was.

47:14.452 --> 47:17.181
Yes, when am I going to meet your wife?

47:18.739 --> 47:21.936
Probably never.

47:25.777 --> 47:29.976
After I came back from Abydos
the first time, she'd already left.

47:31.920 --> 47:34.719
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah. So was I.

47:37.327 --> 47:40.320
I think in her heart she forgave me
for what happened to our kid.

47:40.271 --> 47:42.967
She just couldn't forget.

47:44.239 --> 47:46.001
And what about you?

47:46.798 --> 47:50.791
I'm the opposite. I'll never forgive myself.

47:53.132 --> 47:55.260
But sometimes, I can forget.

48:07.659 --> 48:11.652
People, what is spoken of in this room
is classified as SCI, top secret.

48:11.786 --> 48:15.085
Colonel, what do we know about
these hostiles we didn't yesterday?

48:15.018 --> 48:16.576
Not a hell of a lot, General.

48:16.585 --> 48:21.148
The Abydon boys who survived the attack
on base camp thought it was Ra.

48:21.032 --> 48:22.431
I thought he was dead.
Gentlemen, which is it?

48:22.440 --> 48:23.737
He's dead. He's definitely dead.

48:23.751 --> 48:27.414
I mean, the bomb...
I mean, he's gotta be dead, right?

48:27.367 --> 48:29.494
- Then who's coming through the stargate?
- JACKSON: Gods.

48:29.480 --> 48:32.847
- What?
- Not as in "God" god.

48:32.775 --> 48:34.036
Ra played a god, the sun god.

48:34.054 --> 48:36.146
He borrowed the religion and culture
of the ancient Egyptians

48:36.135 --> 48:38.626
he brought through the gate,
and then he used it to enslave them.

48:38.597 --> 48:42.260
You see, he wanted the people of Abydos
to believe that he was the only one.

48:42.181 --> 48:44.809
You're saying
Ra's not the last of his race, after all?

48:44.773 --> 48:47.264
- Maybe he's got a brother, Ray.
- That's what we need.

48:47.235 --> 48:49.931
Wait a minute.
The legend goes, Ra's race was dying.

48:49.891 --> 48:52.416
He survived by taking over the body
of his human host, an Egyptian boy.

48:52.387 --> 48:54.981
But who's to say more of his kind
couldn't do the same thing?

48:54.947 --> 48:57.938
I mean, this could have happened
at any time, anywhere there's a gate.

48:57.889 --> 49:00.255
I mean, this could be happening right now.

49:00.226 --> 49:02.786
Colonel, you've had the most experience
in fighting this hostile.

49:02.753 --> 49:06.052
Assuming you have to defend yourself
in the field, are you up to it?

49:05.985 --> 49:07.849
- We beat 'em once.
- I'll take that as a maybe.

49:07.840 --> 49:10.570
Captain Carter, you're confident
that the stargate will take us

49:10.527 --> 49:12.586
where we want to go
with this new information?

49:12.576 --> 49:14.407
Well, the computer's feeding
the revised coordinates

49:14.398 --> 49:16.195
into the targeting computer right now.

49:16.190 --> 49:17.556
It'll take time to calculate,

49:17.567 --> 49:20.092
but it should spit out
two or three destinations a month.

49:20.063 --> 49:21.530
Let's not fool ourselves here, people.

49:21.534 --> 49:24.867
This thing is both vast and dangerous,
and we are in so far over our heads

49:24.798 --> 49:26.197
we can barely see daylight.

49:26.204 --> 49:30.835
These hostiles we are up against possess
technology so far superior to our own,

49:30.715 --> 49:32.876
we don't have the faintest idea
how it works.

49:32.860 --> 49:36.353
We would all be much better off
if the stargate had been left in the ground.

49:36.284 --> 49:39.117
With respect, sir, we can't bury
our heads in the sand.

49:39.067 --> 49:42.161
I mean, think of how much we could learn.
Think of what we could bring back.

49:42.106 --> 49:45.599
What you could bring back is precisely
what I'm afraid of, Captain.

49:45.530 --> 49:48.931
However, the President of the
United States happens to agree with you.

49:48.856 --> 49:52.485
In the event your theories pan out, he
has ordered the formation of nine teams,

49:52.409 --> 49:55.400
whose duties will be to perform
reconnaissance, determine threats,

49:55.351 --> 49:59.152
and if possible, to make peaceful contact
with the peoples of these worlds.

49:59.063 --> 50:02.295
Now, these teams will operate
on a covert, top-secret basis.

50:02.231 --> 50:06.827
No one will know of their existence,
except the President and the joint chiefs.

50:06.710 --> 50:08.199
- Colonel O'Neill.
- Sir?

50:08.213 --> 50:10.306
Your team will be designated SG-1.

50:10.293 --> 50:12.318
The team will consist of yourself,
Captain Carter...

50:12.309 --> 50:13.538
And me?

50:14.454 --> 50:17.014
Dr. Jackson, we need you
to work as a consultant

50:16.981 --> 50:18.710
with the other SG teams from here.

50:18.708 --> 50:21.574
Your expertise in ancient cultures
and languages are far too valuable...

50:21.525 --> 50:23.992
I really have to be on their team.

50:25.460 --> 50:28.360
My wife is out there, General. I need to go.

50:32.306 --> 50:34.068
I'll take that under consideration.

50:34.065 --> 50:36.590
Major Kawalsky, you will head SG-2.

50:36.786 --> 50:37.809
I will?

50:37.842 --> 50:40.777
Colonel O'Neill keeps telling me
it's about time you had a command.

50:40.721 --> 50:42.951
I had a moment of weakness.

50:48.943 --> 50:50.967
Ferretti is conscious, sir.

50:52.463 --> 50:53.827
Dismissed.

50:59.885 --> 51:01.853
I'll take over. Thanks.

51:02.317 --> 51:03.715
- Ferretti.
- Hey.

51:04.429 --> 51:06.192
Listen, Ferretti.

51:06.315 --> 51:10.844
I know you're probably not feeling so hot,
but we need something from you.

51:14.730 --> 51:17.563
CARTER: Looks like
he's way ahead of you, Colonel.

51:27.336 --> 51:29.396
You saw all seven symbols?

51:29.384 --> 51:31.818
This is where they went? You sure?

51:36.518 --> 51:37.780
SAMUELS: Colonel, I'd like to remind you,

51:37.798 --> 51:40.927
in the event that you fail to notify
base camp within 24 hours,

51:40.869 --> 51:43.998
SG-2 will scrub the mission,
and return without you.

51:43.942 --> 51:45.239
Understood!

51:45.253 --> 51:48.780
Not gonna happen, Colonel.
SG-2 won't leave without you.

51:49.125 --> 51:50.956
All right, let's confirm transmitter codes.

51:50.949 --> 51:53.418
Remember, only the right code
will open the iris,

51:53.380 --> 51:55.940
and if you lose the transmitter,
you cannot get home.

51:55.907 --> 51:57.000
Understood, sir.

51:57.027 --> 51:59.018
MAN ON PA: Chevron seven unlocked

52:07.170 --> 52:08.728
Let's move out.

52:13.152 --> 52:14.347
Kind of wish I was going with you.

52:14.369 --> 52:17.235
Yeah?
I'm kind of glad you're staying behind.

52:51.418 --> 52:52.510
Damn.

52:59.481 --> 53:01.141
Dammit, it's cold!

53:02.840 --> 53:05.603
Okay, people, let's get the gear out!
Let's move!

53:09.974 --> 53:12.135
JACKSON: Does anybody have a Kleenex?

53:25.940 --> 53:27.065
Come.

53:28.949 --> 53:30.210
No! No!

53:31.891 --> 53:32.880
No!

53:35.027 --> 53:36.585
(LAUGHING)

53:36.594 --> 53:38.391
This one has spirit.

54:13.164 --> 54:14.653
(MOANS)

54:30.634 --> 54:32.829
Does she please you, my love?

54:57.125 --> 54:58.557
(CREATURE SQUEALING)

55:32.096 --> 55:33.757
(SCREAMING)

55:41.789 --> 55:43.690
JACKSON: It must be some sort
of ceremonial place.

55:43.677 --> 55:47.704
The gate is, has to be, an integral
part of their spiritual culture.

55:47.612 --> 55:50.047
See, this place was built for worshippers.

55:50.012 --> 55:54.472
Well, let's just try to be on our way
before the worshippees show up, huh?

55:54.748 --> 55:57.114
You figure out yet how to align
this gate to get back home?

55:57.083 --> 55:59.141
Yeah.
The device is the same as on Abydos.

55:59.130 --> 56:01.121
- This symbol represents...
- Brief Kawalsky's team yet?

56:01.114 --> 56:03.947
- Yes. This symbol represents...
- Good job.

56:06.840 --> 56:09.400
We'll have to set up camp where
there's better cover, Colonel.

56:09.369 --> 56:11.461
Sirs, I found what looks like a trail
down the mountain.

56:11.449 --> 56:13.211
Looks like it's seen traffic
in the last couple of days.

56:13.208 --> 56:15.574
Thank you, Airman. Carter?

56:16.023 --> 56:19.322
I set up a line of Claymores along
that ridge at 10 meter intervals.

56:19.255 --> 56:20.847
That sound about right, Kawalsky?

56:20.855 --> 56:22.583
Yeah. That'll work.

56:38.259 --> 56:41.126
This looks like a good spot right up here!

56:52.400 --> 56:56.565
- All right. If we're not back in 20 hours...
- We'll come rescue your sorry asses.

56:56.465 --> 56:57.489
Negative.

56:57.519 --> 57:00.579
You'll go back through the gate
with the combination Daniel just gave you,

57:00.527 --> 57:02.496
- as you were ordered.
- Yes, sir.

57:02.480 --> 57:05.005
If we don't make it back,
it's 'cause we got our butts kicked,

57:04.974 --> 57:07.967
- and that means you're out of here.
- Yes, sir.

57:08.878 --> 57:11.869
- Hold down the fort.
- Pick me up a T-shirt.

57:20.108 --> 57:23.202
CARTER: So, Dr. Jackson,
tell me more about Sha're.

57:23.148 --> 57:25.481
- How did you meet?
- Sha're? Well, she's...

57:25.451 --> 57:26.509
O'NEILL: She was a gift.

- Come on, people!

01:18:23.381 --> 01:18:24.779
Up the hill!

01:18:34.067 --> 01:18:35.431
Great shot.

01:18:36.435 --> 01:18:38.664
- How many are there?
- A dozen, maybe more.

01:18:38.641 --> 01:18:39.801
They're going back through the gate.

01:18:39.827 --> 01:18:41.192
What about Skaara?

01:18:41.203 --> 01:18:42.726
He's with them.

01:18:49.743 --> 01:18:51.837
Warren! Casey! On my right!

01:19:01.902 --> 01:19:03.529
- No.
- Wait, sir.

01:19:06.061 --> 01:19:07.256
Skaara!

01:19:16.363 --> 01:19:17.625
Skaara.

01:19:53.318 --> 01:19:55.444
- Did you see the symbols?
- No.

01:19:58.628 --> 01:20:01.597
Sir, we got hostiles
coming out of the trees!

01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:07.153
Okay, people,
we're going on a little fieldtrip!

01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:10.302
Daniel, get busy on that stargate.
We got company.

01:20:10.243 --> 01:20:11.233
Captain, arm your Claymores.

01:20:11.266 --> 01:20:12.996
Me and Casey and Warren'll be
the last men out.

01:20:12.993 --> 01:20:17.828
Negative. That's my job.
Captain, help Daniel.

01:20:18.242 --> 01:20:20.335
Once you've sent the signal,
I want you to go through.

01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:21.810
Tell 'em we're bringing company.

01:20:21.826 --> 01:20:24.555
Let's go, move, move, move! Let's go!

01:20:31.070 --> 01:20:32.537
We can't hold 'em, sir!

01:20:32.542 --> 01:20:33.873
Pull 'em out!

01:20:33.886 --> 01:20:35.945
Fall back, fall back. Now.

01:20:42.364 --> 01:20:43.592
- Daniel.
- It's here.

01:20:43.613 --> 01:20:44.806
Go! Go!

01:20:48.125 --> 01:20:49.353
Come on!

01:20:52.954 --> 01:20:55.422
Send the signal
as soon as it opens, Captain.

01:21:07.033 --> 01:21:09.764
OFFICER 1: Check the coordinates.
OFFICER 2: Looking at 'em now.

01:21:10.393 --> 01:21:12.257
- No signal yet, General.
- Stand by.

01:21:14.296 --> 01:21:15.524
Wait! There it is.

01:21:16.184 --> 01:21:18.152
- Is it working?
- Let's hope so.

01:21:27.637 --> 01:21:29.332
Hit the Claymores!

01:21:35.347 --> 01:21:38.180
Captain, let's get these people
out of here now! Move!

01:21:38.131 --> 01:21:41.568
CARTER: Give me a few seconds,
then start sending them through.

01:21:51.634 --> 01:21:52.998
Stand fast!

01:21:53.233 --> 01:21:55.667
Hold your fire! They're refugees!

01:21:56.176 --> 01:21:59.010
I hope you know
what you're doing, Captain.

01:22:01.423 --> 01:22:03.220
Go, go, go! Please!

01:22:12.173 --> 01:22:14.073
(SHOUTING)

01:22:14.061 --> 01:22:16.154
Go, go, go. Stop, stop, stop.

01:22:16.141 --> 01:22:18.632
Now, okay. Come on! Come on!

01:22:24.140 --> 01:22:25.198
Nice!

01:22:31.690 --> 01:22:33.055
That's it!

01:22:33.610 --> 01:22:34.600
Go!

01:22:38.122 --> 01:22:40.216
Casey, Warren, fall back!

01:22:45.961 --> 01:22:48.122
- They behind you?
- I hope so.

01:22:48.935 --> 01:22:50.163
Go! Go!

01:22:59.462 --> 01:23:00.655
Casey!

01:23:02.021 --> 01:23:03.283
Man down!

01:23:05.060 --> 01:23:07.927
Move! Come on, move your ass!

01:23:24.546 --> 01:23:26.537
- Hold your fire! Hold your fire!
- Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

01:23:26.529 --> 01:23:28.121
They're with us!

01:23:40.350 --> 01:23:42.511
Now! Lock it up! Lock it up!

01:23:44.381 --> 01:23:46.077
(BANGING)

01:23:57.628 --> 01:24:01.689
Got it. I got it. He's not breathing.
Let's go. Get him breathing.

01:24:17.625 --> 01:24:18.682
Sir?

01:24:23.609 --> 01:24:27.476
Colonel O'Neill, care to explain?

01:24:28.918 --> 01:24:32.615
We can use the stargate
to send these people home, sir.

01:24:33.750 --> 01:24:35.546
What's he doing here?

01:24:39.893 --> 01:24:45.559
General Hammond, this is Teal'c.
He can help us.

01:24:45.395 --> 01:24:46.555
Do you know what he is?

01:24:46.579 --> 01:24:50.106
Yes sir, I do.
He's the man who saved our lives.

01:24:51.251 --> 01:24:55.914
And if you accept my recommendation, sir,
he'll join SG-1.

01:24:57.394 --> 01:24:59.885
That decision may not be up to you.

01:25:00.208 --> 01:25:02.336
Let's go, man down. Stand back!

01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:05.619
Stand back!
All right, troop, get him off the ramp!

01:25:06.737 --> 01:25:08.863
Let's get him off the ramp.

01:25:20.270 --> 01:25:22.761
Colonel O'Neill, Major Kawalsky.

01:25:23.886 --> 01:25:29.256
The sure-to-be-very-interesting debriefing
of SG units 1 and 2 will be at 0730.

01:25:30.123 --> 01:25:31.386
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

01:25:34.252 --> 01:25:37.846
All right, let's get these people situated.
This way.

01:25:47.273 --> 01:25:49.604
She's out there somewhere, Jack.

01:25:50.121 --> 01:25:52.645
I know. So's Skaara.

01:25:53.287 --> 01:25:54.914
So what do we do?

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:58.432
We find 'em.
