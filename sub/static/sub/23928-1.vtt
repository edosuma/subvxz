04:13.190 --> 04:14.636
He fuckin' does!

04:14.660 --> 04:15.336
Want me to send you a
fucking list of people

04:15.360 --> 04:16.565
he can hang out with, Shane?

04:16.589 --> 04:17.606
Maybe.

04:17.630 --> 04:18.166
I'm sure he doesn't
approve of all the time

04:18.190 --> 04:18.466
you spend with Mary.

04:18.490 --> 04:19.666
Oh!

04:19.690 --> 04:20.536
Now we're going there?

04:20.560 --> 04:21.875
I thought we talked about this.

04:21.899 --> 04:23.776
Now we wanna talk
about fucking Mar.

04:23.800 --> 04:26.976
How many fucking times do you
wanna talk about fucking Mary?

04:27.000 --> 04:28.516
I want to talk about Mary until
we get to the bottom of it!

04:28.540 --> 04:30.980
That was bullshit,
you know that!

06:29.920 --> 06:30.266
Yo, Jay!

06:30.290 --> 06:31.066
Jason, yo.

06:31.090 --> 06:32.206
You got my text, right?

06:32.230 --> 06:33.036
You got-it was a dick.

06:33.060 --> 06:33.806
Yeah.

06:33.830 --> 06:34.236
You got that, right?

06:34.260 --> 06:34.876
Yeah, I got it.

06:34.900 --> 06:35.900
Ok. Get in.

06:37.100 --> 06:38.046
Ow!

06:38.070 --> 06:39.546
What's up, big Jay?

06:39.570 --> 06:41.310
Hey, Mr. Slade.

06:41.330 --> 06:42.716
Hi, Miss Lisa.

06:42.740 --> 06:44.146
Hey.

06:44.170 --> 06:45.946
Hey Summer.

06:45.970 --> 06:47.246
You know, why do you
always wait outside

06:47.270 --> 06:49.116
when we come and pick you up?

06:49.140 --> 06:50.186
You never let me in your house.

06:50.210 --> 06:51.956
Are you-are you embarrassed
of me or something?

06:51.980 --> 06:53.056
Like, what if I
have to pee, man?

06:53.080 --> 06:54.256
No, man.

06:54.280 --> 06:56.256
I just-you know, my house is
a trashy piece of ding dong.

06:56.280 --> 06:59.926
No, my house is a way
trashier piece of ding dong.

06:59.950 --> 07:00.866
There's no way, man.

07:00.890 --> 07:02.900
Yeah, no, 'cause we're
way poorer than you-

07:02.920 --> 07:04.606
Hey, Colin, come on.

07:04.630 --> 07:05.866
We're not that poor.

07:05.890 --> 07:06.666
And stop saying "ding dong".

07:06.690 --> 07:08.736
You sound super lame.

07:08.760 --> 07:09.976
Hey, there we go.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Ha ha!

07:14.840 --> 07:16.580
Jesus Christ, Roger!

07:16.600 --> 07:17.686
Don't text and drive, dad!

07:17.710 --> 07:18.246
I got it!

07:18.270 --> 07:19.186
I'm not texting, ok?

07:19.210 --> 07:20.950
I'm checking my emails.

07:56.910 --> 07:57.956
Alright, guys.

07:57.980 --> 07:58.686
Let's go eat.

07:58.710 --> 08:00.056
Summer, wake up your brother.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.086
Ok.

08:01.110 --> 08:03.226
Oh, no.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.156
Oh, come on, honey.

08:04.180 --> 08:04.866
The Hilltop Diner I'm
sure is good enough

08:04.890 --> 08:06.066
for your distinguished palate.

08:06.090 --> 08:08.236
Yeah, Lisa, I hear that they
serve their chicken nuggets

08:08.260 --> 08:10.100
with caviar.

08:10.120 --> 08:11.806
Mmm, nuggets.

08:11.830 --> 08:14.170
Eh, I'm not hungry.

08:14.190 --> 08:15.706
Sure you don't want somethin'?

08:15.730 --> 08:17.140
Yeah, a top off.

08:17.160 --> 08:18.976
Nobody likes a
morning drunk, Lisa.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.176
Nobody likes a
smart-ass, Summer.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.276
I like morning drunk Lisa.

08:23.300 --> 08:26.186
I'm on vaycay mode.

08:26.210 --> 08:27.756
Great catch, dad.

08:27.780 --> 08:29.186
I hate you.

08:29.210 --> 08:30.986
Be quick.

08:31.980 --> 08:32.856
Yeah.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.640
I'm gonna post that.

08:41.190 --> 08:42.296
What'd you say?

08:42.320 --> 08:43.996
I said "great catch".

08:44.020 --> 08:45.250
And "I hate you".

08:51.160 --> 08:52.330
Oh, wow.

08:52.770 --> 08:55.076
Check out all the missing bros.

08:55.100 --> 08:56.216
I mean, ugh.

08:56.240 --> 08:58.216
One dude called himself "Gator".

08:58.240 --> 08:59.186
What a dick.

08:59.210 --> 08:59.950
Come on, Colin.

08:59.970 --> 09:00.746
Don't be an asshole.

09:00.770 --> 09:01.716
Those guys are missing.

09:01.740 --> 09:04.016
Dad, did you crack a
window open for Lisa?

09:04.040 --> 09:06.926
Don't disrespect your maybe
future stepmom, please.

09:06.950 --> 09:07.726
Ugh.

09:07.750 --> 09:10.096
Oh, seriously dad, don't settle.

09:10.120 --> 09:10.960
What? She's nice.

09:10.980 --> 09:13.196
Yeah, but so was
Dolores and Denise...

09:13.220 --> 09:15.466
And Shannon and Lily.

09:15.490 --> 09:16.766
Yes, and Michelle, too.

09:16.790 --> 09:17.296
Michelle.

09:17.320 --> 09:17.966
Oh, yeah, Michelle.

09:17.990 --> 09:18.466
She was hot.

09:18.490 --> 09:19.306
She was super hot.

09:19.330 --> 09:20.036
Really hot.

09:20.060 --> 09:20.806
I blew that one.

09:20.830 --> 09:21.436
I blew it.

09:21.460 --> 09:22.006
Yeah, it sucks.

09:22.030 --> 09:23.006
And what can I get ya?

09:23.030 --> 09:23.806
Oh, hi.

09:23.830 --> 09:24.876
Uh, yeah.

09:24.900 --> 09:27.276
We will start off with uh,
maybe some bigger menus.

09:32.170 --> 09:33.016
Ok.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.316
Uh, can I get some coffee?

09:34.340 --> 09:36.986
You know, com-don't
listen to him.

09:37.010 --> 09:39.456
He's making me sound like I'm
an irresponsible parent.

09:39.480 --> 09:41.726
We'll just get four
beers, please.

09:45.050 --> 09:46.166
Nope, still nothing.

09:46.190 --> 09:48.996
I'll get the Trucker's Breakfast
please and thank you.

09:49.020 --> 09:51.096
Uh, salad, please.

09:51.120 --> 09:53.966
Uh, can I get toast
and jam, please?

09:53.990 --> 09:56.306
Uh, can I just get
some eggs and shit?

09:56.330 --> 09:58.276
Colin, come on.

09:58.300 --> 10:01.210
Can I have some eggs
and shit, please?

10:01.230 --> 10:03.276
Eggs and shit coming right up.

10:03.300 --> 10:03.846
Thank you.

10:03.870 --> 10:05.446
Shouldn't take too long.

10:05.470 --> 10:07.246
That's-you wanna take those?

10:07.270 --> 10:07.886
No?

10:07.910 --> 10:09.956
Ok, we'll just leave them.

10:09.980 --> 10:12.790
So, guys, who's excited, huh?

10:12.810 --> 10:13.386
Camping trip?

10:13.410 --> 10:14.226
I'm excited.

10:14.250 --> 10:14.956
Going to a cabin.

10:14.980 --> 10:16.456
We're gonna act like rednecks,

10:16.480 --> 10:18.766
or people who don't trust
the government, huh?

10:18.790 --> 10:19.796
You already don't.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.126
I know I don't, yeah.

10:21.150 --> 10:22.396
So, Jay?

10:22.420 --> 10:23.896
Not excited?

10:23.920 --> 10:25.866
Your dad doesn't take you
camping or something?

10:25.890 --> 10:29.136
No, my dad's not really the
camping type, Mr. Slade.

10:29.160 --> 10:31.560
Yeah, 'cause your dad's more of
the dick-sucking type, right?

10:31.830 --> 10:32.506
Stop!

10:32.530 --> 10:33.306
Woah, Colin, too much. Uh uh.

10:33.330 --> 10:34.846
No, I mean, that's
what Jason says

10:34.870 --> 10:36.076
and Jay knows I'm just
messin' with him.

10:36.100 --> 10:37.416
That's how we roll.

10:37.440 --> 10:39.286
What, you act like a little
douche and then Jason

10:39.310 --> 10:40.450
politely takes it?

10:40.470 --> 10:42.986
Hey, I don't just take it.

10:43.010 --> 10:44.486
You kinda do, Jay.

10:44.510 --> 10:46.286
Yeah, you kinda do,
Jay, honestly.

10:46.310 --> 10:49.026
You need to toughen up a
little bit, you know?

10:49.050 --> 10:50.796
Start with a power
five, you know?

10:50.820 --> 10:51.866
See, a power five.

10:51.890 --> 10:53.530
Like this, come on. Power five!

10:53.550 --> 10:54.026
Like that.

10:54.050 --> 10:54.766
We'll work on it.

10:54.790 --> 10:55.796
We'll work on it this weekend.

10:55.820 --> 10:59.006
Or you could just be super
butchy like Summer.

10:59.030 --> 11:01.236
Hey, shut up, pube-head.

11:01.260 --> 11:02.206
Uh uh, stop it.

11:02.230 --> 11:02.840
Stop what?

11:02.860 --> 11:05.006
Stop wasting food, Colin.

11:05.030 --> 11:08.146
Ketchup is not food,
Ronald Reagan.

11:08.170 --> 11:09.016
Ok, stop it now-

11:09.040 --> 11:09.980
Ooooh!

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
Guys, come on!

11:11.340 --> 11:12.316
Oh man!

11:12.340 --> 11:13.186
Shit, Colin!

11:13.210 --> 11:14.886
Colin, enough. Seriously.

11:14.910 --> 11:15.986
Summer, language.

11:16.010 --> 11:17.020
Jason, bathroom.

11:17.040 --> 11:17.716
I'm sorry about that, Jay.

11:17.740 --> 11:19.526
That was super trashy of me.

11:19.550 --> 11:20.890
What?

11:20.910 --> 11:22.080
It was funny.

11:24.380 --> 11:24.926
Uh uh.

11:24.950 --> 11:25.396
What?

11:25.420 --> 11:26.096
Nope!

11:26.120 --> 11:26.966
Ok, alright.

11:26.990 --> 11:27.836
Put it down!

11:27.860 --> 11:30.236
Ok, just leave the
condiments alone.

11:30.260 --> 11:31.236
Please.

11:31.260 --> 11:34.336
I swear both of you are
adopted, you know that?

11:34.360 --> 11:35.876
That's some funny shit, dude.

11:35.900 --> 11:37.906
Seriously, you should
come by my dad's cottage.

11:37.930 --> 11:39.346
You know, I'm gonna
start my own business-

11:39.370 --> 11:41.010
Blue chips, paint chips, stocks.

11:41.030 --> 11:42.046
Yeah.

11:42.070 --> 11:42.546
Yeah, we like to
go to the casino-

11:42.570 --> 11:43.316
Paint chip stocks?

11:43.340 --> 11:44.380
Yeah.

11:44.400 --> 11:46.086
Seriously, you should
come to my dad's cottage,

11:46.110 --> 11:47.286
it is so chill.

11:47.310 --> 11:48.256
Hot tub.

11:48.280 --> 11:50.256
So. Chill.

11:50.280 --> 11:52.990
Um...

11:53.010 --> 11:55.626
excuse me, I need to...
get through...

11:55.650 --> 11:56.496
Hey! Hey, broskis!

11:56.520 --> 11:58.260
Can you let the kid
through, please?

12:00.390 --> 12:01.366
Dude.

12:01.390 --> 12:04.400
I think that kid just
got his first period.

12:04.420 --> 12:06.206
What a fine young
woman you've become.

12:07.230 --> 12:10.176
Sweetie, don't let the
big bad bros scare ya.

12:10.200 --> 12:12.976
They might look pretty but
they ain't that smart.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.600
I like you guys better
drunk and quiet.

12:17.600 --> 12:21.286
The more you drink the less you
talk and the more I like you.

12:21.310 --> 12:22.086
Hear that, bro?

12:22.110 --> 12:23.380
She thinks we're pretty.

12:25.480 --> 12:28.056
Why don't you go get the rest
of that taken care of, sweetie?

12:28.080 --> 12:29.096
Alright, thanks.

12:29.120 --> 12:31.026
I'll just...

12:31.050 --> 12:33.166
Yeah, let's get lit!

12:33.190 --> 12:35.436
Don't forget to thank
the nice lady, Jason.

12:35.460 --> 12:37.500
Don't forget to ask your
friend for a tampon, Jason.

12:51.670 --> 12:53.500
I had coffee.

12:56.480 --> 12:57.550
I saved you some sausages.

12:59.350 --> 13:01.326
You like sausages,
don't you, Lisa?

13:01.350 --> 13:02.156
Colin.

13:02.180 --> 13:02.896
Yeah.

13:02.920 --> 13:04.926
Of course she likes sausages.

13:06.720 --> 13:08.360
We're talking about penises.

14:02.740 --> 14:04.440
Couldn't find somewhere
further, could you?

14:06.350 --> 14:07.190
Seriously, Roger.

14:07.210 --> 14:08.726
Yeah, seriously, dad.

14:08.750 --> 14:09.596
It's the cheapest place

14:09.620 --> 14:10.626
that I could find on
Craigslist, alright?

14:10.650 --> 14:12.726
You think that I can
afford a place that is not

14:12.750 --> 14:15.720
in the middle of nowhere
or potentially dangerous?

14:17.220 --> 14:18.036
Hey, you picked him.

14:18.060 --> 14:20.170
He's my dad so I
have to like him.

14:20.190 --> 14:21.590
You guys are bonding.

14:23.100 --> 14:25.006
That makes me feel
all warm inside.

14:25.030 --> 14:26.430
Don't settle, Lisa.

14:32.170 --> 14:35.656
It's nice being out of
the city, eh, Summer?

14:35.680 --> 14:38.556
Touching nature.

14:38.580 --> 14:41.326
Being able to be in
touch with nature.

14:41.350 --> 14:42.626
Yeah, Jay.

14:42.650 --> 14:44.096
You can touch nature all
you want, there, buddy.

14:44.120 --> 14:45.566
No, I just meant...

14:45.590 --> 14:47.796
it's nice to spend
time and uh...

14:47.820 --> 14:49.366
can I grab your bag for you?

14:49.390 --> 14:50.666
Knock yourself out, boy scout.

14:55.230 --> 14:57.100
This place looks
like a murder cabin.

14:58.170 --> 14:59.576
Jay, you should keep
my sister close

14:59.600 --> 15:01.310
so she can protect you.

15:04.800 --> 15:06.346
You know, it doesn't say
it in the instructions

15:06.370 --> 15:08.156
but I mean there's
gotta be a hidden key

15:08.180 --> 15:11.156
around here somewhere, right?

15:11.180 --> 15:12.526
High-tech security.

15:12.550 --> 15:13.790
Safe.

15:13.810 --> 15:14.886
Shotgun the best room!

15:14.910 --> 15:17.196
You can't shotgun what
you can't see, dumb-ass.

15:17.220 --> 15:18.126
Nyuuuh.

15:18.150 --> 15:18.996
Ok, watch the booze, Rog.

15:19.020 --> 15:21.696
I am not spending a
week in here sober.

15:23.360 --> 15:25.066
Women. Am I right, big guy?

15:27.390 --> 15:28.790
Let me help you with that.

15:31.860 --> 15:33.060
Oh.

15:34.700 --> 15:35.746
This is nice.

15:35.770 --> 15:37.180
Dad, this place sucks.

15:37.200 --> 15:38.186
What're you talking about?

15:38.210 --> 15:39.780
It's cozy in here.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.516
Where's Lisa?

15:42.540 --> 15:44.556
Oh, Lisa's gone.

15:44.580 --> 15:45.740
What do you mean, she's gone?

15:47.250 --> 15:48.496
She get a ca-oh, you're joking.

15:48.520 --> 15:49.556
Ha.

15:49.580 --> 15:50.126
Funny.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.080
Just up there, Jason.

16:10.470 --> 16:11.776
Thanks for dropping my bags off.

16:11.800 --> 16:14.346
Oh, yeah, no, that was...

16:14.370 --> 16:15.316
that was no problem, Summer.

16:15.340 --> 16:19.140
I was just uh... just
happy I could help.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.410
You know, I've seen the
way you look at me.

16:25.690 --> 16:27.630
You're like 14 or something?

16:31.690 --> 16:33.236
Adorable.

16:33.260 --> 16:34.260
But weird.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.776
Adorable is good, right?

16:41.800 --> 16:42.800
Nah.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.616
You blew it, man.

16:45.640 --> 16:48.180
Oh, I shotgun this
bed, by the way.

16:49.810 --> 16:51.286
If you forgot the
white tequila, Roger,

16:51.310 --> 16:52.586
I swear to God...

16:52.610 --> 16:54.256
Come on, my little
fortune cookie,

16:54.280 --> 16:55.856
I'd never forget the white gold.

16:55.880 --> 16:58.526
Oh, dad, sweet racism.

16:58.550 --> 17:00.426
What?

17:00.450 --> 17:01.496
Was I racist?

17:06.460 --> 17:08.876
I'm gonna explore.
You two coming?

17:08.900 --> 17:11.376
Hmm, spend more time
with my lame sister?

17:11.400 --> 17:12.646
Yeah, sure, we'll go.

17:12.670 --> 17:13.276
Ok.

17:13.300 --> 17:14.945
Dad, Lisa, we're leaving!

17:14.970 --> 17:15.915
Ok, later.

17:15.940 --> 17:18.380
Babe, pay attention to me!

17:54.640 --> 17:58.426
Wow, you must be a really
good pitcher, Summer.

17:58.450 --> 17:59.986
I play first base.

18:00.010 --> 18:04.896
So, uh... your parents
like to party, huh?

18:04.920 --> 18:07.230
Lisa's not my mom.
But yeah, they do.

18:07.250 --> 18:08.250
Yours?

18:09.420 --> 18:11.736
Um... yeah, no, they
party all the time.

18:11.760 --> 18:12.906
They're, like, super trashy.

18:12.930 --> 18:16.636
Ok, dude, don't try to hit
on my sister in front of me.

18:16.660 --> 18:18.706
I wasn't hitting on
your sister, man.

18:18.730 --> 18:20.730
She's not even really my type.

18:22.940 --> 18:24.880
Really? Why is that?

18:27.840 --> 18:33.256
Well, uh... you walk
weird, and um...

18:33.280 --> 18:36.826
uh, your hair is too messy

18:36.850 --> 18:43.366
and, uh, you can be mean
sometimes and, uh...

18:43.390 --> 18:44.496
well, your family is-

18:44.520 --> 18:46.536
Messed up?

18:46.560 --> 18:47.406
That's not what I meant-

18:47.430 --> 18:48.430
To say?

18:48.960 --> 18:50.806
Look, I'm messing
with you, Jason.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.360
You really gotta loosen up, man.

18:58.740 --> 19:01.786
My family's messed
up, too, you know.

19:04.310 --> 19:05.610
Strike two, playa.

19:40.950 --> 19:42.690
Yooooo!

19:44.980 --> 19:46.496
Check it out!

19:46.520 --> 19:47.666
Woah.

19:47.690 --> 19:49.536
Maybe a deer died
here or something.

19:49.560 --> 19:50.766
Yeah, it's pretty sweet.

19:50.790 --> 19:53.520
This would be good for
LARP Camp next week.

19:55.660 --> 19:59.646
Uh, yeah, about that live action
role play thing next week...

19:59.670 --> 20:05.586
well, I mean, it's really
more of a seminar.

20:05.610 --> 20:09.786
But, uh, I don't even know
if I can go or whatever.

20:09.810 --> 20:11.920
Oh, 'cause you wanna go
on a date with my sister?

20:11.940 --> 20:12.886
Dude.

20:12.910 --> 20:13.786
No way, man.

20:13.810 --> 20:15.826
I mean, she could come
to LARP camp too,

20:15.850 --> 20:19.626
but I mean, she would
make a great demon cow.

20:19.650 --> 20:20.926
Whatever, man.

20:20.950 --> 20:23.096
Ugliest, nastiest demon cow.

20:23.120 --> 20:23.736
Woah.

20:23.760 --> 20:24.666
Ever.

20:24.690 --> 20:27.406
Well, I mean, she's-
she's not that ugly.

20:27.430 --> 20:28.476
Dude.

20:28.500 --> 20:29.536
Gross.

20:29.560 --> 20:31.606
Hey! Dungeons and Dildos,
let's keep moving!

20:31.630 --> 20:32.806
We were just, you know-

20:32.830 --> 20:35.360
Dude. Who cares?

21:10.800 --> 21:12.546
Whatever you're showing
us better be better

21:12.570 --> 21:14.646
than playing with
bones in the woods.

21:14.670 --> 21:15.870
Ok, Summer?

21:25.080 --> 21:26.196
Fuck.

21:26.220 --> 21:27.996
Oh, ok.

21:28.020 --> 21:30.496
A shitty old house with a
bunch of shitty old cars.

21:30.520 --> 21:32.196
Fuck off, Colin.

21:32.220 --> 21:33.820
Sweet.

21:36.000 --> 21:36.776
Oh, uh, guys?

21:36.800 --> 21:38.546
I think this is
private property.

21:38.570 --> 21:40.146
Yeah, be more of a wuss, Jason.

21:40.170 --> 21:42.010
Girls love that stuff.

21:43.900 --> 21:44.900
Shotgun!

21:50.010 --> 21:51.120
Ugh!

Hey.

21:56.620 --> 21:57.660
Summer!

21:57.680 --> 21:59.966
I don't-I really don't
think we should be here.

21:59.990 --> 22:01.990
Are you scared of guard
dogs or something?

22:03.020 --> 22:05.166
Um... yeah.

22:05.190 --> 22:06.590
Aren't you?

22:08.090 --> 22:09.160
No.

22:10.260 --> 22:12.036
Well, good. I feel
safer already.

22:12.060 --> 22:13.776
Yo, what is all this shit?

22:13.800 --> 22:15.430
Hey guys, come here!

22:16.700 --> 22:18.100
Oh, Colin, get outta there.

22:19.140 --> 22:20.650
Ugh.

22:20.670 --> 22:21.146
Oh, gross.

I'm gonna barf!

22:22.070 --> 22:22.916
Oh, god.

22:22.940 --> 22:23.486

Yeah.

22:28.750 --> 22:30.096
Yo, wait!

22:30.120 --> 22:32.526

up in this barrel!

22:32.550 --> 22:34.526
Hey, that might actually
be worth something.

22:34.550 --> 22:36.696
Hey, fuck you! That's mine!

22:36.720 --> 22:38.136
You're such a pussy, Colin.

22:38.160 --> 22:39.106
Hey, shut up. That's sexist.

22:39.130 --> 22:42.236

such a penis, Summer.

the heck outta here.

22:44.930 --> 22:47.776

watches and cell phones

22:47.800 --> 22:49.176
and crap in here, too.

22:49.200 --> 22:49.976

22:58.550 --> 22:59.956

22:59.980 --> 23:00.726
Arrested?

23:00.750 --> 23:02.750
We're gonna get
freakin' murdered!

23:07.620 --> 23:08.266
Ok, go.

23:27.110 --> 23:30.010

mechanic or something?

27:54.370 --> 27:54.886
I wanna see.

27:54.910 --> 27:55.816
No, Colin, let's go!

27:55.840 --> 27:56.356
Come on, let's go.

27:56.380 --> 27:56.786
Please.

27:56.810 --> 27:57.556
No, you saw it.

27:57.580 --> 27:58.820
You wanted to save these bros.

28:00.010 --> 28:01.040
Colin!

28:09.560 --> 28:10.436
Come on! Let's go!

28:10.460 --> 28:11.860
Now!

28:18.030 --> 28:19.030
Summer!

28:19.970 --> 28:20.970
Summer!

28:21.430 --> 28:22.206
Colin!

28:22.230 --> 28:23.046
Summer!

28:23.070 --> 28:24.146
Colin!

28:24.170 --> 28:25.300
What did you see?!

28:26.570 --> 28:27.570
What did you see?!

28:28.510 --> 28:29.386
Blood! Eating!

28:29.410 --> 28:31.286
She killed them!

28:31.310 --> 28:32.310
Fuck.

28:36.650 --> 28:38.296
What the hell'd
you do that for?!

28:38.320 --> 28:39.366
What do you mean?

28:39.390 --> 28:40.166
I just saved the
other dude's life!

28:40.190 --> 28:41.396
How?

28:41.420 --> 28:43.036
Well, now she knows that
someone else is out here

28:43.060 --> 28:45.036
and saw everything.

28:45.060 --> 28:47.830
And that she should murder
us to tie up loose ends?!

28:49.400 --> 28:52.140
Well... I thought you were
gonna throw a rock, too!

28:52.160 --> 28:53.160
Guys!

29:00.110 --> 29:00.586
Let's go!

29:00.610 --> 29:01.850
Go!

29:10.420 --> 29:11.496
You're such a little
prick, Colin!

29:11.520 --> 29:12.560
This is all your fault!

29:12.580 --> 29:13.496
How is this my fault?

29:13.520 --> 29:15.596
"Oh, those playas gonna
have a threesome!"

29:15.620 --> 29:17.966
How was I supposed to know
she's a bro-drugging psycho?

29:17.990 --> 29:19.206
I'm not fucking psychic!

29:19.230 --> 29:20.536
Oh yeah, but you're
bloody stupid!

29:20.560 --> 29:21.936
Yeah, and you're a bloody bitch!

29:21.960 --> 29:23.136
No wonder mom left!

29:23.160 --> 29:23.576
Guys!

29:23.600 --> 29:24.600
Fuck you!

29:25.000 --> 29:25.476
Guys!

29:25.500 --> 29:26.306
What?!

29:26.330 --> 29:27.246
Listen to me!

29:27.270 --> 29:29.546
Chances are that woman,

29:29.570 --> 29:31.480
she probably knows these
woods better than we do.

29:31.500 --> 29:34.486
We're not safe until we tell
your parents what happened.

29:34.510 --> 29:39.226
So apologize now and let's go.

29:39.250 --> 29:40.326
Or don't.

29:40.350 --> 29:43.350
Either way, we should
still get going.

29:45.950 --> 29:47.966
Ok, good.

29:47.990 --> 29:48.666
Let's go.

29:48.690 --> 29:50.390
Let's go, ok?

31:21.080 --> 31:23.056
You got any 8's?

31:23.080 --> 31:25.326
Go fish.

31:25.350 --> 31:27.226
It's your lucky day, cowgirl.

31:32.790 --> 31:35.136
You got any 4's?

31:35.160 --> 31:37.636
Mmm...

31:37.660 --> 31:38.536
nope.

31:38.560 --> 31:40.060
Go fish.

31:43.800 --> 31:45.716
Caught a big one.

31:45.740 --> 31:46.686
Well, well, well.

31:46.710 --> 31:47.416
Start-

31:47.440 --> 31:48.216
Dad! Dad!

31:48.240 --> 31:49.816
Oh, shit!

31:49.840 --> 31:50.960
Dad, there's a psycho bitch!

31:52.840 --> 31:54.326
Lisa and I, we were just um...

31:54.350 --> 31:55.590
Playing Go Fish Foreplay, yeah.

31:56.780 --> 31:58.656
Wait, that's a thing?

31:58.680 --> 31:59.326
Fuck, hot dogs.

31:59.350 --> 32:01.166
Hey, sensible bites, Colin.

32:01.190 --> 32:02.830
Ok, dad, you need
to listen to me.

32:02.850 --> 32:03.936
Yeah, what's up?

32:03.960 --> 32:06.706
The-the neighbour, it's-
it's our neighbour and it-

32:06.730 --> 32:07.736
Henry's here?

32:07.760 --> 32:08.570
I love that guy.

32:08.590 --> 32:09.776
Sperm whale, where
are you, you...

32:09.800 --> 32:10.836
What the fuck, dad?

32:10.860 --> 32:12.776
Not our neighbour back
home, our neighbour here!

32:12.800 --> 32:14.210
Are you drunk already?

32:14.230 --> 32:15.306
If I say yes will you be mad?

32:15.330 --> 32:15.646
Yes!

32:15.670 --> 32:16.516
Then no.

32:16.540 --> 32:18.080
Ok, dad, you really
need to focus here.

32:18.100 --> 32:19.116
Ok.

32:19.140 --> 32:20.086
Our neighbour, she drugged
these guys and then-

32:20.110 --> 32:22.116
and then I think she
killed one of them and-

32:22.140 --> 32:23.740
No, she would have fed
them to something.

32:25.140 --> 32:27.086
That's the same as killing them!

32:27.110 --> 32:28.056
Mmm.

32:28.080 --> 32:29.626
So what you're saying
is that our neighbour,

32:29.650 --> 32:32.120
who is a lady, is
also a cannibal.

32:33.650 --> 32:36.736
Colin, is she hot?

32:36.760 --> 32:37.760
Yeah.

32:38.820 --> 32:40.666
We gotta go then and
check this out.

32:40.690 --> 32:41.366
Ok, dad-

32:41.390 --> 32:42.766
Lisa...

32:42.790 --> 32:43.636
Look, we-can we just call the
cops and get outta here?

32:43.660 --> 32:44.776
Come on, we're not
gonna call the cops.

32:44.800 --> 32:45.740
Look.

32:45.760 --> 32:46.760
Fine. I'll drive.

32:48.470 --> 32:50.176
Yeah, I'm gonna let you drive.

32:50.200 --> 32:51.716
Screw you, Lisa.

32:51.740 --> 32:53.316
Oh, Summer, come on.

32:53.340 --> 32:54.816
You don't suppose that there's
a landline around here

32:54.840 --> 32:55.616
or something?

32:55.640 --> 32:56.516
What's a landline?

32:56.540 --> 32:58.686
Oh my god, why did
we even come here?!

32:58.710 --> 32:59.386
'Cause it's cheap.

32:59.410 --> 33:01.226
Alright, ok, guys, seriously.

33:01.250 --> 33:01.890
Enough.

33:01.910 --> 33:04.326
We'll go for a walk.

33:04.350 --> 33:06.126
I'm gonna get some fresh air,

33:06.150 --> 33:07.296
and check out this cabin.

33:07.320 --> 33:08.596
Together.

33:08.620 --> 33:09.766
Ok?

33:09.790 --> 33:12.300
If there's anything shady going
on I'll take care of it.

33:12.320 --> 33:13.506
No, dad, nu-uh.

33:13.530 --> 33:14.906
Summer. Summer.

33:14.930 --> 33:16.336
Hey, I got this.

33:16.360 --> 33:17.776
Huh?

33:17.800 --> 33:21.276
Seriously dad, you're really
not helping anything.

33:21.300 --> 33:23.400
Jason. Jason!

33:24.900 --> 33:26.246
Have fun, Jason!

33:26.270 --> 33:28.870
I'll have fun in here
not getting eaten!

33:30.340 --> 33:31.810
You can help me make dinner.

33:33.510 --> 33:34.510
No.

33:35.880 --> 33:37.110
I guess you already ate.

33:39.190 --> 33:39.826
Woah.

33:39.850 --> 33:41.896
I peed on my beer cans.

33:41.920 --> 33:43.866
I almost wrote my whole name.

33:46.230 --> 33:47.666
Here.

33:47.690 --> 33:49.436
What do you want me
to do with this?

33:49.460 --> 33:50.406
Woah, woah, woah,

33:50.430 --> 33:52.840
hey now, Jay, big Jay,
come on, no, no, no.

33:52.860 --> 33:56.846
Only responsible- rebe...
response...

33:56.870 --> 34:00.246
only persponsible grown-ups
are allowed to use the axes.

34:00.270 --> 34:01.486
Mmmkay?

34:01.510 --> 34:02.550
Lisa.

34:02.570 --> 34:03.756
Lisa!

34:03.780 --> 34:04.320
Huh?

34:04.340 --> 34:05.516
Take a photo of-of me.

34:05.540 --> 34:06.770
I look like a lumberjack.

34:09.250 --> 34:11.190
You look so sexy.

34:12.980 --> 34:13.926
Eh?

34:13.949 --> 34:15.266
That's disgusting.

34:15.290 --> 34:16.235
No, it's not.

34:16.260 --> 34:16.866
It's sexy.

34:16.889 --> 34:17.866
You heard her say it.

34:17.889 --> 34:18.929
Ugh.

34:20.659 --> 34:23.235
With any luck he's gonna
get bored and fall asleep

34:23.260 --> 34:24.906
and then we can drag his
drunk ass back home.

34:24.929 --> 34:26.690
No, you won't!

34:29.940 --> 34:31.840
Hey, look! I got a kick-stand.

34:34.639 --> 34:36.315
You drink six, you
piss out twelve.

34:36.340 --> 34:37.815
Am I right, kids?

34:37.840 --> 34:40.755
Yeah, dad, you've had your fun,
so we can go back now, right?

34:40.780 --> 34:41.556
There's hot dogs at home.

34:41.580 --> 34:43.726
Yeah, but this is way more fun.

34:43.750 --> 34:46.666
I don't think he should be
out here in this state.

34:46.690 --> 34:48.429
Well, to be fair, my dad
does his best fighting

34:48.449 --> 34:49.795
when he's drunk.

34:49.820 --> 34:51.396
Yeah, that's right.

34:51.420 --> 34:52.835
Power five.

34:56.500 --> 34:57.876
That was pretty weak, Jason.

34:57.900 --> 34:59.906
I'm being honest with you.

34:59.930 --> 35:01.676
I'll tell you-give you
a word of advice.

35:01.700 --> 35:04.876
A man can always tell
how manly a man is

35:04.900 --> 35:07.346
by how powerful his
power five is.

35:07.370 --> 35:09.356
Thanks for those words of wisdom, Mr.
Slade.

35:09.380 --> 35:10.856
That's great.

35:10.880 --> 35:12.720
Roger.

35:12.740 --> 35:15.326
Call me Roger.

35:15.350 --> 35:19.566
I consider you t-to be
a son to me, you know?

35:19.590 --> 35:21.830
A taller, better-looking son.

35:21.850 --> 35:22.566
God, dad!

35:22.590 --> 35:23.436
I'm joking!

35:23.460 --> 35:24.636
Come on.

35:24.660 --> 35:26.400
Let's go find some
fucking cannibals.

35:29.860 --> 35:30.776
Hey, cannibals!

35:30.800 --> 35:31.800
Ok.

35:34.300 --> 35:35.860
Just a little more quiet, maybe?

35:37.800 --> 35:39.700
Hit me baby one more...

35:51.820 --> 35:54.530
So this is it.

35:54.550 --> 35:56.896
I should go on adventures
with you kids more often.

35:57.690 --> 35:58.690
Shhh!

36:01.390 --> 36:03.960
Bum-bum-bum-ba-ba-ba...

36:11.470 --> 36:12.116
Mr. Slade!

36:12.140 --> 36:13.746
You really need to be quiet!

36:13.770 --> 36:15.586
Ok, you know what, Jason?

36:15.610 --> 36:19.926
I'm super drunk and
I'm kinda high.

36:19.950 --> 36:23.456
So being quiet is
really hard for me.

36:23.480 --> 36:24.926
Mmmkay?

36:24.950 --> 36:25.756
Good talk.

36:25.780 --> 36:26.466
Boop boop.

36:26.490 --> 36:26.926
Huh?

36:26.950 --> 36:27.950
Let's go.

36:29.520 --> 36:31.666
Aaah.

Oh, that smells like shit.

can friggin' murder me?

41:06.060 --> 41:07.060
Fuck!

41:45.340 --> 41:46.686
Ok, so what now?

41:46.710 --> 41:47.746
Well, maybe we should-

41:47.770 --> 41:49.686
Think we should split up
and cover more ground?

41:49.710 --> 41:51.656
I was thinking the exact
same thing, my friend.

41:51.680 --> 41:54.720
I was actually gonna say stick
together no matter what, but...

41:56.310 --> 41:57.840
Jason?

41:58.420 --> 42:00.966
You, my friend, are
a tactical genius.

42:00.990 --> 42:03.296
That's why I would not
wanna play chess with you.

42:03.320 --> 42:07.106
Also because chess
is fucking boring.

42:07.130 --> 42:10.136
I do-I-I have to say, I
broke into this house

42:10.160 --> 42:14.706
under the promise that I was
going to see some crazy shit.

42:14.730 --> 42:19.416
So far, pretty disappointed
in the both of you.

42:19.440 --> 42:21.916
So where is she, huh?

42:21.940 --> 42:23.346
Where's the sexy cannibal?

42:24.340 --> 42:25.186
Hey, Jason, Hey!

42:25.210 --> 42:26.016
Come here! Come here!

42:26.040 --> 42:26.886
Come on, boy.

42:26.910 --> 42:29.826
I got-I got a good idea.

42:29.850 --> 42:31.860
We should start a band
called Sexy Cannibals.

42:31.880 --> 42:32.796
Huh?

42:32.820 --> 42:34.830
I'm the guitar and
singer, obviously,

42:34.850 --> 42:36.066
you play the drums,

42:36.090 --> 42:38.836
Colin plays the bass, what's
her name plays whatever it is,

42:38.860 --> 42:41.136
we go on tour, we play
some fuckin' shows,

42:41.160 --> 42:42.706
we sleep in the van...

42:42.730 --> 42:46.176
it's not as creepy as it
sounds, and we fuckin' party.

42:46.200 --> 42:49.070
And we'll party all the days...
long days.

42:51.400 --> 42:53.070
What if no one
goes to our shows?

42:55.840 --> 42:57.186
Why wouldn't people
go to our shows...

42:57.210 --> 42:59.350
should be the question
that you ask.

43:01.750 --> 43:03.456
I just bought a drum
machine, actually-

43:03.480 --> 43:04.056
You bought a-

43:04.080 --> 43:05.796
Hey, guys! Come here!

43:05.820 --> 43:07.296
What? No.

43:07.320 --> 43:09.030
It's too far.

43:09.050 --> 43:09.496
Ok, fine.

43:09.520 --> 43:10.936
Stay there.

43:10.960 --> 43:12.130
Just don't touch anything.

43:13.490 --> 43:14.836
Jason?

43:14.860 --> 43:15.960
Get your axe.

43:20.070 --> 43:21.870
Get your axe, Jason.

43:25.940 --> 43:27.740
You be careful with
that thing, buddy.

43:43.320 --> 43:44.836
Woah.

43:44.860 --> 43:46.036
Yeah.

43:46.060 --> 43:47.200
Woah.

44:28.370 --> 44:29.810
Ready?

44:44.850 --> 44:45.950
Dad?!

44:53.160 --> 44:54.230
Oh.

44:57.560 --> 44:58.876
That's not good.

44:58.900 --> 45:00.240
Yeah, no shit.

45:01.630 --> 45:02.800
I don't...

45:06.040 --> 45:08.046
He's still breathing.

45:08.070 --> 45:10.156
Ok, good, good, good.

45:10.180 --> 45:12.056
I think he drank some
of that drug wine.

45:12.080 --> 45:13.456
Yeah, no shit, Jason.

45:13.480 --> 45:15.090
Come on. Help him up.

45:18.380 --> 45:19.866
Dad? Dad!

45:19.890 --> 45:20.526
Dad.

45:20.550 --> 45:22.866
Roger? Roger!

45:22.890 --> 45:23.966
God.

45:23.990 --> 45:25.436
Fuck, I hate you.

45:25.460 --> 45:27.066
Let's move this table.

45:27.090 --> 45:28.466
It's a fact, my dad's an idiot.

45:28.490 --> 45:30.236
Maybe he'll be fine in
a few hours or days.

45:30.260 --> 45:31.906
I don't know that much
about drugs, but...

45:31.930 --> 45:33.276
That's hoping that psycho
doesn't mind having

45:33.300 --> 45:36.240
a 200 pound moron sitting
in her living room.

45:38.200 --> 45:39.376
Come on, dad.

45:41.510 --> 45:42.750
He's heavy.

45:42.770 --> 45:45.056
Yeah, well, he's 40 and all he
does is watch cartoons and eat,

45:45.080 --> 45:46.926
of course he's fuckin' heavy.

45:51.920 --> 45:53.226
That's not working.

45:53.250 --> 45:54.610
Well, what then?

45:57.060 --> 45:58.036
Where are you going?

45:58.060 --> 46:00.006
I'm locking the door in
case she comes back.

46:00.030 --> 46:01.906
We're gonna have to hide him.

46:01.930 --> 46:03.370
Close that door.

46:03.390 --> 46:04.890
Fine.

46:12.240 --> 46:13.410
What the hell?

46:22.110 --> 46:23.056
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

46:23.080 --> 46:24.496
Don't tell me you wanna
put him in there.

46:24.520 --> 46:25.520
Uh-uh.

46:26.420 --> 46:28.366
I don't think we have a choice.

46:28.390 --> 46:29.390
Fuck.

46:38.030 --> 46:39.206
Actually, we can do
better than that.

46:39.230 --> 46:41.976
That's... that's not good.

46:49.470 --> 46:50.470
Jason?

46:51.140 --> 46:52.156
Jason, just get the weapons.

46:52.180 --> 46:52.620
Come on.

46:52.640 --> 46:53.986
Come on!

46:54.010 --> 46:55.586
Come on, come on.

46:57.280 --> 46:59.110
Come on!

47:08.990 --> 47:10.290
Ready?

47:18.770 --> 47:20.286
Oh god, I'm sorry!

47:20.310 --> 47:21.310
I'm sorry!

47:22.270 --> 47:23.146
What the hell?!

47:23.170 --> 47:24.086
Oh Jesus, I'm sorry!

47:24.110 --> 47:25.150
I'm sorry!

47:25.780 --> 47:26.586
I'm sorry!

47:26.610 --> 47:27.486
I'm sorry!

47:27.510 --> 47:29.486
You're gonna be sir,
I know first aid!

47:32.120 --> 47:33.120
Woah!

47:35.590 --> 47:36.130
Shit!

47:36.150 --> 47:37.196
Shit, shit, shit, shit!

47:39.520 --> 47:39.896
You know what?

47:39.920 --> 47:40.466
No, no, no!

47:40.490 --> 47:41.666
Ok, we need to help him.

47:41.690 --> 47:42.336
Why?

47:42.360 --> 47:43.006
Really?

47:43.030 --> 47:44.030
Yes!

47:46.630 --> 47:48.006
Woah!

47:52.100 --> 47:53.516
Oh, Jesus!

47:53.540 --> 47:54.540
Oh!

48:21.670 --> 48:23.510
That was messed up.

48:25.400 --> 48:26.176
Ok, ok, ok.

48:26.200 --> 48:27.686
We gotta get-we gotta get dad.

48:27.710 --> 48:28.710
Ok.

48:30.310 --> 48:30.786
Come on.

48:30.810 --> 48:31.856
Yeah.

48:31.880 --> 48:35.626
So we're gonna go home,
grab the van, pick up dad,

48:35.650 --> 48:37.390
and get the hell out of here.

48:40.120 --> 48:41.360
Ok.

48:42.220 --> 48:43.320
Get him...

49:06.580 --> 49:07.726
No, Summer.

49:07.750 --> 49:08.356
Please, I don't wanna-

49:08.380 --> 49:10.296
Shut up, we're doing this.

49:13.680 --> 49:14.680
Oh my god.

49:17.520 --> 49:18.296
Come on.

49:18.320 --> 49:20.090
Let's uh, squish it.

49:26.360 --> 49:27.690
Shit.

49:31.500 --> 49:32.376
Throw him in!

49:32.400 --> 49:33.046
Now?

49:33.070 --> 49:34.200
Come on, come on, let's go!

49:58.900 --> 49:59.676
Summer!

49:59.700 --> 50:01.476
Were those what I
think they were?

50:01.500 --> 50:03.476
I don't know, because to
me those looked like-

50:08.410 --> 50:08.916
Shit!

50:08.940 --> 50:10.150
Come on, come on!

50:45.940 --> 50:47.256
What?

50:47.280 --> 50:49.256
What is it, honey?

51:06.830 --> 51:08.206
What is it?

51:08.230 --> 51:09.606
Is that a rat?

51:09.630 --> 51:10.546
Drop it.

51:10.570 --> 51:11.716
Drop it!

51:11.740 --> 51:12.740
Ugh.

51:36.490 --> 51:39.476
Dude, did you just
smell my hand?

51:39.500 --> 51:42.810
What? No, I was just...
I was just sighing.

51:48.810 --> 51:50.756
Colin? Colin!

51:50.780 --> 51:51.780
Lisa?

51:53.280 --> 51:56.256
Summer? Summer!

51:56.280 --> 51:56.656
Summ-

51:56.680 --> 51:57.910
Colin? Lisa?

52:12.800 --> 52:14.746
Lisa!

52:14.770 --> 52:16.810
Oh my god, I'm sorry.

52:16.830 --> 52:18.046
I- I didn't like her or anything

52:18.070 --> 52:20.016
but I didn't want
her to turn into...

52:24.010 --> 52:24.886
Colin!

52:24.910 --> 52:26.020
We have to find Colin.

52:33.920 --> 52:35.390
No, not again!

52:39.320 --> 52:40.706
I think I'm gonna puke.

52:40.730 --> 52:41.136
No, no, no.

52:41.160 --> 52:42.370
What the hell?!

52:42.390 --> 52:43.390
What the hell?

52:46.500 --> 52:47.806
I think she's one of them.

52:47.830 --> 52:48.346
Oh really?

52:48.370 --> 52:49.846
What gave that away?

52:49.870 --> 52:50.910
Fuck.

52:53.670 --> 52:55.486
So, are we gonna-

52:55.510 --> 52:56.586
Seriously, Jason?

52:56.610 --> 52:57.456
Look, Lisa might be a bitch

52:57.480 --> 52:58.556
but she's still my
dad's girlfriend.

52:58.580 --> 53:01.850
Maybe we can, I don't know,
save her, or... the...

53:03.780 --> 53:07.366
Oh, I think when the blood's
black there's no going back.

53:07.390 --> 53:10.336
Now's the time you decide to
develop a sense of humour?

53:10.360 --> 53:12.666
Sorry, I'm just trying to
state the obvious, here!

53:15.760 --> 53:17.436
I'm sorry Miss...

53:17.460 --> 53:18.936
I don't know what
Lisa's last name is!

53:18.960 --> 53:20.290
Wait.

53:20.800 --> 53:22.300
Wait.

53:23.000 --> 53:24.300
Lisa?

53:27.810 --> 53:28.810
Oh shit!

53:32.940 --> 53:33.786
Jason!

53:33.810 --> 53:35.010
Do something!

53:36.510 --> 53:37.510
Uh...

53:41.950 --> 53:42.950
Oh my god.

53:46.460 --> 53:47.466
Ah!

53:47.490 --> 53:47.936
I'm sorry!

53:47.960 --> 53:48.736
I'm sorry!

53:48.760 --> 53:49.760
Jesus!

53:51.960 --> 53:52.936
Jason!

53:52.960 --> 53:54.506
Get her off me!

53:54.530 --> 53:55.530
Get her off!

54:00.610 --> 54:01.940
This is so messed up!

54:02.940 --> 54:03.940
Shit!

54:07.850 --> 54:09.990
Jason, Jason, where
are you going?

54:12.980 --> 54:13.696
Woah.

54:13.720 --> 54:14.126
Woah, woah, woah!

54:14.150 --> 54:14.966
Wait, wait!

54:14.990 --> 54:16.060
Aaaaaggh!

54:17.150 --> 54:18.150
Oh my god!

54:20.860 --> 54:21.860
Holy shit!

54:32.970 --> 54:33.876
Colin!

54:33.900 --> 54:35.586
Get out of the way!

54:35.610 --> 54:37.150
I've never done this before!

54:39.180 --> 54:39.886
Holy shit!

54:39.910 --> 54:40.910
What?

54:41.610 --> 54:42.610
Lisa!

54:45.220 --> 54:46.490
Did I get her?

54:48.150 --> 54:48.726
Fuck.

54:48.750 --> 54:49.266
Colin.

54:49.290 --> 54:50.196
Colin, I thought...

54:50.220 --> 54:50.996
I know, I know.

54:51.020 --> 54:52.736
I know.

54:52.760 --> 54:54.966
The neighbour, she was
here and then... and-

54:54.990 --> 54:57.676
and I was peeing but then I-

54:57.700 --> 54:59.606
she was doing something
to Lisa and I got scared

54:59.630 --> 55:01.576
and I ran away and I
heard you guys screaming

55:01.600 --> 55:04.716
and then I came in and then
Lisa was acting all crazy

55:04.740 --> 55:05.880
and then she was trying
to kill you guys

55:05.900 --> 55:08.100
so I just... I just...

55:09.240 --> 55:11.050
did I just kill Lisa?

55:15.080 --> 55:16.650
Dude, it's ok, man.

55:18.120 --> 55:19.626
I- I think I peed my pants.

55:19.650 --> 55:20.996
Oh, gross.

55:21.020 --> 55:21.796
Whatever, man.

55:21.820 --> 55:22.966
I mean, you're covered in, like,

55:22.990 --> 55:24.660
blood and brains and shit.

55:26.260 --> 55:27.630
So where's dad?

55:29.690 --> 55:30.690
What?

55:31.830 --> 55:32.436
He's back at her place.

55:32.460 --> 55:33.976
You left him back there?!

55:34.000 --> 55:34.906
What, is he dead, too?

55:34.930 --> 55:35.846
No, no, he's not dead,

55:35.870 --> 55:37.816
he's safe and we're
going back to get him.

55:37.840 --> 55:39.016
Look, he's not
dead, you hear me?

55:39.040 --> 55:40.646
Why is he even there?

55:40.670 --> 55:42.910
He drank some of the drugged
wine and then he passed out.

55:45.780 --> 55:46.780
Fuck.

55:49.580 --> 55:50.910
That's not my house, you know.

55:53.650 --> 55:56.166
The cabin?

55:56.190 --> 55:59.196
No, the one you
always pick me up at.

55:59.220 --> 56:00.650
The dump?

56:02.160 --> 56:02.636
Yeah.

56:02.660 --> 56:04.536
No, I actually...

56:04.560 --> 56:06.976
I live in this big house
on Berksley Street

56:07.000 --> 56:08.940
and my parents are loaded.

56:10.640 --> 56:14.046
Well, whatever man, I
mean mine are, too.

56:14.070 --> 56:18.986
No, I mean they're money
loaded, not drunk loaded.

56:19.010 --> 56:20.010
Oh.

56:22.810 --> 56:25.126
My dad's a dick and he
treats my mom like crap

56:25.150 --> 56:30.030
and, you know, they're
probably getting a divorce.

56:30.050 --> 56:33.036
This morning I left and I didn't
tell them where I was going

56:33.060 --> 56:38.806
and uh... now I might die

56:38.830 --> 56:42.276
and I don't even know if
they'll really give a shit.

56:42.300 --> 56:43.076
Whatever, man.

56:43.100 --> 56:47.316
I mean, my parents are divorced.

56:47.340 --> 56:49.016
And who knows? I mean, maybe...

56:49.040 --> 56:51.656
maybe your dad'll get
an undead girlfriend

56:51.680 --> 56:53.956
and you'll get to blow
her brains out, too.

56:53.980 --> 56:56.190
Colin, what?

56:56.210 --> 56:57.756
Well, I don't know, I'm nervous!

56:57.780 --> 56:59.220
And I talk too much
when I'm nervous.

57:02.590 --> 57:04.936
Wait, so you lied to me?

57:04.960 --> 57:07.806
I'm, like, your best friend
and I tell you the truth

57:07.830 --> 57:13.840
about everything and... like
that time when I wiped my ass

57:13.860 --> 57:15.206
with Dave's toothbrush
because he-

57:15.230 --> 57:18.146
he cheated on magic.

57:18.170 --> 57:21.186
I was just... trying
to fit in, I guess.

57:21.210 --> 57:23.950
By pretending to be poor?

57:23.970 --> 57:25.156
That is so weird, man.

57:25.180 --> 57:27.926
It's... weird.

57:27.950 --> 57:32.826
You know, your family,
it might look messed up

57:32.850 --> 57:34.826
but you guys actually
love each other,

57:34.850 --> 57:37.366
like deep down somewhere.

57:37.390 --> 57:42.106
You guys are more like my
real family, you know?

57:42.130 --> 57:43.930
You sensitive bitch.

57:47.360 --> 57:51.616
That was some seriously
deep shit, dude.

57:51.640 --> 57:53.916
I love you, man.

57:53.940 --> 57:55.850
You too, man.

57:55.870 --> 57:57.340
Cute.

58:00.910 --> 58:02.956
You know, Mr. Slade,

58:02.980 --> 58:04.656
maybe he drinks too much

58:04.680 --> 58:07.226
and he swears and he's
not very responsible-

58:07.250 --> 58:09.726
He farts in my face
sometimes, but...

58:09.750 --> 58:11.096
But he loves you guys,

58:11.120 --> 58:13.296
and he actually gives
a crap about me.

58:13.320 --> 58:15.306
Well, enough to make fun of me

58:15.330 --> 58:18.406
and tell me when I'm
getting stepped all over.

58:18.430 --> 58:21.206
So we're not gonna let
some crazy cannibal lady

58:21.230 --> 58:22.876
take him away from us.

58:22.900 --> 58:26.746
We're gonna go back there and
we're gonna mess her up!

58:26.770 --> 58:29.416
She's not even that hot, anyway.

58:29.440 --> 58:31.250
So where'd you get the gun?

58:44.150 --> 58:45.836
Just in here.

58:45.860 --> 58:49.706
By the way, shotgun.

58:49.730 --> 58:52.100
As in, shotgun the shotgun.

58:59.940 --> 59:01.716
Woah.

59:01.740 --> 59:03.016
Let's gear up.

59:03.040 --> 59:04.956
And blow some bros.

59:04.980 --> 59:07.356
You're gonna blow
some bros, Colin?

59:07.380 --> 59:08.386
Blow up some bros.

59:08.410 --> 59:09.756
You know what I mean.

59:09.780 --> 59:11.080
Yeah.

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:06.946
Let's fuck shit up!

01:00:06.970 --> 01:00:07.676
Woah.

01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:09.146
Someone's balls just dropped.

01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:27.666
This is a pretty shitty weekend.

01:00:27.690 --> 01:00:30.406
I'm gonna say it because all
we've been doing is walking up

01:00:30.430 --> 01:00:33.940
and down this path, we've seen
some pretty disgusting shit

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:37.176
like blood and gore, you
know, and now it's snowing.

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.916
I got snow in my shoes, and...

01:00:38.940 --> 01:00:40.280
I pissed my pants earlier

01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:42.316
and you guys wouldn't
let me clean it.

01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:43.916
So fuck you guys for that.

01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:45.186
Sweeties!

01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:48.856
Stop it. Stop it.

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:49.486
Get down.

01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:50.386
They're the bros.

01:00:50.410 --> 01:00:51.256
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:52.226
She fished them out
of the basement.

01:00:52.250 --> 01:00:55.166
Don't make this harder
than it needs to be.

01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:57.796
You're gonna pay for
what you did to Lisa!

01:00:57.820 --> 01:00:58.496
Yeah!

01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:00.090
We're gonna tell on you!

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:04.170
"We're gonna tell on you"?

01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:08.046
The cops don't know,
the cops don't care.

01:01:08.070 --> 01:01:11.016
They'll never suspect
me, they're all sexist.

01:01:12.270 --> 01:01:12.980
Fuck!

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:13.516
Shit!

01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:14.540
Split up! Split up!

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.950
You're out of your league, kids!

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:19.780
Alright, come on.

01:01:20.910 --> 01:01:22.270
I want you to get them, huh?

01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:27.026
Go get 'em.

01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:28.280
Go on, boys.

01:01:29.290 --> 01:01:29.766
Go on.

01:01:29.790 --> 01:01:31.536
Go get 'em, boys.

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:32.900
Go get 'em.

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:35.606
Do you have any snacks?

01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:38.106
I- I ate all my hot dogs
and I'm so fuckin' hungry.

01:01:38.130 --> 01:01:40.106
No, I don't have
any snacks, man.

01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:41.130
Fuck.

01:01:43.870 --> 01:01:45.570
Oh, goddammit, Harold, stop it.

01:01:46.970 --> 01:01:48.300
Come on, honey.

01:01:49.970 --> 01:01:51.086
You go make me proud.

01:01:51.110 --> 01:01:53.020
Make me proud, honey.

01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:28.186
I got one!

01:02:28.210 --> 01:02:29.210
Get down!

01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:45.930
Oh, fuck.

01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:47.636
Shit. Shit.

01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:49.476
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

01:02:52.570 --> 01:02:53.580
Holy shit!

01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:02.286
Check mate, biatch!

01:03:02.310 --> 01:03:03.310
Fuck!

01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:07.326
Yo, she-bitch!

01:03:11.090 --> 01:03:12.096
I got her!

01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:27.076
Oh, disgusting!

01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:27.646
Guys, guys!

01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:29.146
Where's the neighbour?

01:03:29.170 --> 01:03:30.570
Wha-

01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:33.956
I don't know, but
let's go and get dad!

01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:35.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:03:39.180 --> 01:03:39.996
Ah, fuck.

01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:41.460
Now I got piss and
blood all over me.

01:04:15.550 --> 01:04:17.720
Wha-what's with
all the unicorns?

01:04:23.530 --> 01:04:25.200
Fuck unicorns.

01:04:44.810 --> 01:04:45.356
Where's dad?

01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:46.610
Dad's under the stairs.

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:01.376
He's coming!

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:02.570
Who's coming?

01:05:05.140 --> 01:05:06.080
Summer.

01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:07.270
Who's coming?

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:11.300
Fuck.

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:14.270
The fuck is she talking about?

01:05:19.450 --> 01:05:20.620
Holy shit.

01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:26.336
Shit!

01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:26.966
Shit.

01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:28.406
Um, Jason, hold the door.

01:05:28.430 --> 01:05:30.170
Colin, help me out here.

01:05:30.190 --> 01:05:31.190
Ok.

01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:33.230
Come on.

01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:54.560
Ok, come on, come on.

01:05:56.490 --> 01:05:57.366
Summer.

01:05:57.390 --> 01:05:59.096
Summer, where's dad?

01:05:59.120 --> 01:05:59.596
Where are we going?

01:05:59.620 --> 01:06:00.266
Shh!

01:06:00.290 --> 01:06:02.336
Guys, where are you going?

01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:03.470
What're you doing?

01:06:03.490 --> 01:06:04.236
Guys?

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:05.176
Shh!

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:06.800
Shut up!

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:13.846
Creepy kids!

01:06:18.410 --> 01:06:20.250
Hey, you guys look cool.

01:06:23.450 --> 01:06:24.526
What's up with the crack babies?

01:06:24.550 --> 01:06:25.590
Dad, stay down!

01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:28.366
Ah gross!

01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:29.626
Dad, come on!

01:06:29.650 --> 01:06:30.396
Come on!

01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:31.136
Is that blood?

01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:31.696
Yes!

01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:33.866
Because fucking dead!

01:06:33.890 --> 01:06:35.506
What do you mean, fucking dead?

01:06:35.530 --> 01:06:36.906
Is that... blood on you, too?

01:06:36.930 --> 01:06:38.406
Dad, I need your help!

01:06:38.430 --> 01:06:39.376
What happened to the room?

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:41.276
What-ok, why is there a couch-

01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:42.146
What?

01:06:42.170 --> 01:06:43.410
Bring it-Colin, help
me bring it down.

01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:44.206
What?

01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:45.776
No, dad, I need you to help me!

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:47.570
Just stop yelling.

01:06:48.910 --> 01:06:49.716
Hey, Colin.

01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:50.350
Hey.

01:06:50.370 --> 01:06:50.916
Buddy.

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:51.686
Hey. Hey!

01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:52.686
I'm trying to-woah.

01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:53.486
Look...

01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:54.886
Come on, bash her skull in!

01:06:54.910 --> 01:06:56.156
You know I love
you, buddy, right?

01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:57.256
Yeah.

01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:59.896
A- And-And I know I can act
dumb sometimes, right?

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:01.566
I'm trying!

01:07:01.590 --> 01:07:03.730
And I know I should
probably act more mature.

01:07:03.750 --> 01:07:04.726
Y- yeah.

01:07:04.750 --> 01:07:06.336
I just wanna be the fun dad.

01:07:07.090 --> 01:07:08.806
You know, the-the cool dad.

01:07:08.830 --> 01:07:09.266
Alright?

01:07:09.290 --> 01:07:09.906
Come on, Jason!

01:07:09.930 --> 01:07:11.036
It's just a little girl!

01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:14.706
But it's... it's hard, you
know, your mother and I...

01:07:14.730 --> 01:07:15.806
Uh-huh, yeah.

01:07:15.830 --> 01:07:16.606
That's why this is so messed up!

01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:18.916
I just want you
to know that I...

01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:22.786
I love you and your
sister very much.

01:07:22.810 --> 01:07:24.186
Ok, dad, we love you, too.

01:07:24.210 --> 01:07:25.256
Ok, good stuff.

01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:27.186
Good talk.

01:07:27.210 --> 01:07:28.210
And I...

01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:44.936
S- Summer, what did you do?

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:46.236
What did you do?

01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:47.576
Ok, dad, we gotta get
out of here now.

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:48.646
Come on.

01:07:48.670 --> 01:07:50.346
Where's Lisa?

01:07:50.370 --> 01:07:51.976
Dad. Dad.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.330
Lisa's gone.

01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:56.250
What do you mean, she's gone?

01:07:56.270 --> 01:07:57.446
What do you...

01:07:57.470 --> 01:07:59.416
She turned into one of those
and then Colin had to...

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:00.440
Colin had to what?

01:08:03.350 --> 01:08:04.726
Colin? Colin?

01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:05.996
Colin had to what?

01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:06.696
Look, dad, you can increase your
chances of meeting someone new

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:08.760
if we get out of here alive.

01:08:11.890 --> 01:08:12.996
Oh... yeah, alright.

01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:21.206
What is that?

01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:22.975
Ok, dad, help me with the door!

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:23.746
What the fuck is that?

01:08:23.770 --> 01:08:25.410
Help me with the fucking door!

01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:29.286
Fuck, I hate axes!

01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:52.776
My babies!

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:54.540
What did you do to my babies?!

01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:55.560
Colin, gun!

01:08:58.340 --> 01:08:58.916
Shit!

01:08:58.939 --> 01:08:59.939
I didn't reload it!

01:09:09.609 --> 01:09:10.609
Fuck!

01:09:14.819 --> 01:09:16.666
I liked Lisa, you fucking bitch!

01:09:22.689 --> 01:09:23.689
Here's another one!

01:09:33.939 --> 01:09:34.939
Dad!

01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:37.970
Are you ok?

01:09:38.710 --> 01:09:41.020
She fucking stabbed me!

01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:43.326
Fuck off with the
throwing the knives!

01:09:43.350 --> 01:09:44.555
Fuck.

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:48.666
Is it bad?

01:09:48.689 --> 01:09:49.626
You got stabbed!

01:09:49.649 --> 01:09:50.126
Yeah, it's bad.

01:09:50.149 --> 01:09:50.895
It's pretty bad!

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:51.636
It's pretty bad.

01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:52.660
Yeah.

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:54.560
Idiot!

01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:56.630
Stay!

01:10:09.410 --> 01:10:10.710
I think we're done here.

01:10:17.610 --> 01:10:18.556
Summer!

01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:19.956
Summer, dad's hurt!

01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:20.626
Fuck.

01:10:20.650 --> 01:10:21.996
Shit.

01:10:22.690 --> 01:10:23.630
Oh my god, dad!

01:10:23.650 --> 01:10:25.496
Don't worry, we're gonna
get you out of here!

01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:27.066
Shit, he's losing
a lot of blood.

01:10:27.090 --> 01:10:28.436
Fuck!

01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:29.636
Summer, don't use that
kind of language,

01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:30.370
it doesn't suit you.

01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:30.966
Guys, guys!

01:10:30.990 --> 01:10:32.106
Car keys!

01:10:32.130 --> 01:10:33.650
There's, like, a ton
of cars out there!

01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:38.876
Alright, dad, dad, BRB.

01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:39.946
What does that mean?

01:10:39.970 --> 01:10:41.340
Jason, stay with dad!

01:10:42.970 --> 01:10:45.090
I gotta-I gotta find something
to stop this bleeding.

01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:00.766
Duct tape.

01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:02.966
It really is good
for everything.

01:11:02.990 --> 01:11:04.036
Stay with me, Roger.

01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:05.066
You're gonna be ok, alright?

01:11:05.090 --> 01:11:08.946
Hey, you called me-you
called me by first name.

01:11:08.970 --> 01:11:11.816
P- power five.

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:13.146
Ow.

01:11:13.170 --> 01:11:15.046
You nailed it.

01:11:15.070 --> 01:11:16.186
Dad, we got a car.

01:11:17.210 --> 01:11:18.050
Is it nice?

01:11:18.070 --> 01:11:19.470
Yes.

01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:23.126
You always were my
favourite, Colin.

01:11:23.150 --> 01:11:24.426
I hate you.

01:11:24.450 --> 01:11:25.450
No you don't.

01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:15.090

01:12:27.980 --> 01:12:32.520
That was my family you just
killed, you little shit!

01:12:34.250 --> 01:12:35.796
Ten years.

01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:39.136
Ten years of feeding,
caring for them.

01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:42.666
Do you have any idea
how hard it was?

01:12:42.690 --> 01:12:44.966
And did I get any thank yous?

01:12:46.300 --> 01:12:47.240
No!

01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:50.106
Not one fucking thank you!

01:12:50.130 --> 01:12:52.916
Oh, bitch, you're so dramatic!

01:12:52.940 --> 01:12:54.780
But they loved me!

01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:58.046
They really loved me!

01:12:58.070 --> 01:13:00.286
Who's gonna love me now, huh?

01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:01.310
Who?

01:13:04.610 --> 01:13:05.940
Who cares?

01:13:28.670 --> 01:13:30.540
That was for Roger.

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:39.556
You shouldn't have
messed with my family!

01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:43.096
Your dad was a piece of shit.

01:13:44.850 --> 01:13:46.150
Wait!

01:13:50.030 --> 01:13:51.600
I got this.

01:14:02.610 --> 01:14:05.280
Consider this the
ultimate power five, dad.

01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:36.116
