00:01.000 --> 00:02.798
<i>[Amanda] Previously on Ugly Betty:</i>

00:02.869 --> 00:05.497
Why do they say it's not
your social security number?

00:05.572 --> 00:08.336
You can't get one if you're
in this country illegally.

00:08.408 --> 00:12.208
I need you to find my watch. I left it
at a woman's apartment last week.

00:12.278 --> 00:16.908
He dates anything that moves, and I
agree to smile and take their messages.

00:16.983 --> 00:20.714
You may want to return some of these.
Nico's called twice.

00:20.787 --> 00:22.118
Hi, Mom.

00:22.188 --> 00:25.157
Who's filling his head
with stories about me and Fey?

00:25.225 --> 00:26.522
Who gave him the music box?

00:26.593 --> 00:30.927
I think it's time for Fey Sommers
to come out of seclusion.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.630
He could be deported?

00:37.303 --> 00:39.203
A very strong possibility, yes.

00:39.272 --> 00:42.469
But he has a family, he pays taxes.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.840
- He's a Mets fan.
- He's in Oprah's Book Club!

00:44.911 --> 00:48.142
Given what you've told me,
your father's been red flagged.

00:48.214 --> 00:50.910
"Red flagged"? Is that bad?

00:50.984 --> 00:53.953
It means the government
is investigating, and ultimately,

00:54.020 --> 00:56.488
a judge could rule
to send you back to Mexico.

00:56.556 --> 00:58.387
You could've just said "bad."

00:58.458 --> 01:02.053
Mr. Suarez, something I have to ask,
you've been here for 30 years?

01:02.128 --> 01:05.096
- Mm-hm.
- You never applied for a green card?

01:05.165 --> 01:07.565
Never began the citizenship process?

01:07.634 --> 01:09.329
What about amnesty in the '80s?

01:09.402 --> 01:12.667
I was a little busy providing
for my family. Is that a problem?

01:12.739 --> 01:15.867
- Dad...
- Look, the past is past.

01:15.942 --> 01:18.103
I want to talk about now.

01:18.178 --> 01:20.169
How much will it cost
for you to help us?

01:20.246 --> 01:21.770
This meeting was pro bono.

01:21.848 --> 01:24.976
My wife asked me because
she loves your daughter's product.

01:25.051 --> 01:29.385
- Thank you.
- That fiber-loss cleaned her out.

01:29.456 --> 01:34.325
But a case like this, if you
want to save your father,

01:34.394 --> 01:35.861
it starts with a retainer.

01:39.999 --> 01:43.662
- [Hilda] Twenty grand?
- Do you validate?

01:46.005 --> 01:49.702
Hey, slow down. After last night,
I think I need a walker.

01:49.776 --> 01:53.143
<i>We are late. The meeting about
the Must Mode issue's starting.</i>

01:53.213 --> 01:55.272
Oh, Cruella De Vil can wait.

01:55.348 --> 01:58.977
Your lost watch, ever figure out
which girl's apartment you left it at?

01:59.052 --> 02:02.078
- No, Betty never told me.
- I was gonna talk to you about it,

02:02.155 --> 02:05.591
but then we got interrupted.
It wasn't your fault...

02:07.894 --> 02:09.725
We should take separate elevators.

02:09.795 --> 02:12.230
Wouldn't want the office
getting the wrong idea.

02:12.298 --> 02:16.325
Right, because my panties stuffed in
your paper shredder didn't tip them off.

- [Gasps]

02:36.089 --> 02:39.183
Great. Just great.

02:39.259 --> 02:42.456
I could help you, I've got a lot
women's clothes up in my office.

02:42.529 --> 02:45.293
- Hold these, please.
- Fashion clothes in the office.

02:45.365 --> 02:49.301
- What are you doing?
- You gotta do what you gotta do.

02:50.336 --> 02:53.703
The fastest first date I've ever had.

02:53.773 --> 02:56.037
You can't be serious.

02:56.476 --> 02:58.842
You actually think you got a shot?

02:58.912 --> 03:00.641
Here, now?

03:00.713 --> 03:04.706
I was just joking. I mean...
You smiled at me in the lobby.

03:04.784 --> 03:07.844
Because I couldn't believe you
pulled a ditch and dash

03:07.921 --> 03:10.446
with that poor girl back there.

03:12.725 --> 03:15.159
You had it all played out in your head.

03:15.228 --> 03:19.096
You, me, no one else here.

03:19.165 --> 03:23.124
We'd be on the floor,
bodies sweating,

03:23.203 --> 03:25.103
rug burn on my back.

03:26.539 --> 03:29.133
- [Elevator dings]
- Well...

03:29.209 --> 03:31.006
...so much for that fantasy.

03:34.581 --> 03:37.550
<i>As we do every year
for our Must Mode issue,</i>

03:37.617 --> 03:41.553
your ideas, picks, lists
will be considered for inclusion.

03:43.957 --> 03:45.982
[Cell phone rings]

03:50.730 --> 03:52.755
Nico, I told you, only emergencies.

03:53.700 --> 03:57.261
<i>No, you cannot submit
my apartment for Pimp Yo House.</i>

03:57.337 --> 03:58.395
Goodbye.

04:00.773 --> 04:03.537
Family is staying with me, temporarily.

04:04.344 --> 04:08.246
Remember, it's not just an "it" list.
There are personal "musts" as well.

04:08.881 --> 04:12.248
Like "must be on time."

04:12.986 --> 04:15.546
For others, it's a bit more profound.

04:15.622 --> 04:19.023
What's important is that
we tap into the issues

04:19.091 --> 04:21.993
of our readers' lives they cannot face.

04:22.060 --> 04:24.757
Move them to the next stage
in their lives,

04:24.831 --> 04:27.265
promise them it won't
be another year

04:27.333 --> 04:31.929
full of unanswered questions
and unresolved issues.

04:32.071 --> 04:33.834
And, lest we forget,

04:33.906 --> 04:37.808
it is about the
fashion must-haves for 2007.

04:37.877 --> 04:42.314
And I can assure you,
it will not include polka dots.

04:42.382 --> 04:44.373
- [Gasps]
- That's it.

04:44.450 --> 04:46.645
Start listing.

04:49.856 --> 04:51.790
You have an 11:30 layout conference.

04:51.858 --> 04:54.793
Your father's office called,
editors meeting tomorrow.

04:54.861 --> 04:57.728
There's this woman,
smoking hot, works on 27.

04:57.797 --> 05:02.666
She's not wearing a shirt, has some sort
of accent. Find out who she is, OK?

05:03.836 --> 05:06.396
Must hunt down Daniel's babe.

05:09.175 --> 05:12.736
<i>Whatever Bradford Meade does,
he can't get rid of me.</i>

05:12.979 --> 05:16.005
[Woman] Sometimes it's like
she's still here.

05:18.117 --> 05:21.518
You remember what tomorrow is,
don't you?

05:24.223 --> 05:25.918
How could I forget?

05:32.999 --> 05:35.433
Nico, darling, I'm home.

05:36.969 --> 05:40.632
- What is that?
- Dinner. You didn't have much.

05:40.707 --> 05:42.402
White wine...

05:42.475 --> 05:44.466
...and Pecorino di Pienza.

05:45.511 --> 05:47.672
It's a cheese. Goes great with pears.

05:47.747 --> 05:49.772
And cereal goes great with milk.

05:50.583 --> 05:51.948
How was your day, dear?

05:52.018 --> 05:54.111
I picked these up today.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.280
Brochures. For schools in New York.

05:56.356 --> 05:59.723
Don't be silly, schools here
don't meet your standards.

05:59.792 --> 06:03.125
I was thinking of
the Hertzog School in Switzerland.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.891
Expelled, remember?

06:04.964 --> 06:07.558
I think, maybe,
boarding school's not for me.

06:08.668 --> 06:12.126
I said that to the senator when
he sent me to the Chamberlin School.

06:12.205 --> 06:16.403
He'd just won his first
Congressional seat. He told me...

06:16.476 --> 06:19.570
"Willie, D.C. Is no place
for my daughter to become a young lady."

06:19.645 --> 06:21.909
[Wilhelmina]
Same thing for you and New York.

06:21.981 --> 06:24.643
Boarding school has
a far better education,

06:24.717 --> 06:28.653
far better people
and far better food than...

06:29.288 --> 06:31.483
..."Captain Crisp."

06:31.557 --> 06:35.049
"Cap'n." I don't think he's
an official maritime officer.

06:38.064 --> 06:40.532
[Betty] Dad, is this
everything from Mexico?

06:40.600 --> 06:43.125
Yeah, birth certificate, passport,

06:43.202 --> 06:45.363
maybe even an old baby picture.

06:45.438 --> 06:47.702
Careful, I might be naked in that one.

06:47.774 --> 06:50.572
The lawyer's gonna
need these documents.

06:50.643 --> 06:52.577
Yeah, the lawyer we can't afford.

06:52.645 --> 06:55.205
[Betty] There's enough to
apply for a green card.

06:55.281 --> 06:58.114
You were here in '86,
and Reagan offered the amnesty.

06:58.184 --> 07:00.584
I...

07:00.653 --> 07:02.348
I missed it, OK?

07:04.590 --> 07:07.787
Look, I'm sorry
I'm putting you through all this.

07:07.860 --> 07:11.227
But maybe if we tighten our belts,
got second jobs, maybe it...

07:11.297 --> 07:16.234
Dad, I really want to help, but my
first job is hard enough as it is.

07:16.302 --> 07:19.169
- Not if you maximize your time.
- Hilda, don't go there.

07:19.238 --> 07:22.799
- I'm not gonna sell Herbalux.
- Models don't want to lose weight?

07:22.875 --> 07:25.366
It's easy money.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.606
It's not the worst idea in the world.

07:27.680 --> 07:31.480
I will set you up with
a basic package just to tease them.

07:32.318 --> 07:33.580
What's this?

07:38.157 --> 07:40.284
It looks like somebody was torn out.

07:44.797 --> 07:46.287
It's nothing...

07:46.365 --> 07:49.994
...just a photo of Mom
with an old boyfriend.

07:50.069 --> 07:52.128
Ooh! Let me see!

07:52.205 --> 07:56.073
A boyfriend? I thought you said
you were each other's first loves?

07:56.142 --> 07:58.167
Can you stop with the damn questions?

08:03.449 --> 08:04.939
I'm going for a walk.

08:06.052 --> 08:07.519
If that's OK, Betty?

08:11.057 --> 08:14.823
What's with you? Obviously he
is sensitive about all of this.

08:14.894 --> 08:17.124
There's something he's not telling us.

08:17.196 --> 08:20.461
We're just trying to help him,
Hilda. We deserve to know.

08:20.533 --> 08:22.763
- Does that upset you?
- Of course it does.

08:22.835 --> 08:25.565
Getting upset doesn't help.
He's always there for us.

08:25.638 --> 08:28.300
We just... we gotta
be there for him now.

08:28.374 --> 08:30.308
Fine.

08:30.376 --> 08:33.708
<i>I'll sell Herbalux at Mode.
I mean, I'd do anything I'd have to.</i>

08:33.779 --> 08:38.182
But I'm not just gonna let him off the
hook. Not until he tells us the truth.

08:59.605 --> 09:01.573
OK, give it back to me, girl.

09:01.641 --> 09:05.008
"The Vita Value pack contains all
essential vitamins from A to Z."

09:05.077 --> 09:07.045
There's no such thing as a vitamin Z.

09:07.113 --> 09:09.138
Hello, it's a catchy sales pitch.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.877
What is more important
than the vitamin content?

09:11.951 --> 09:14.886
"Half off when purchased with
the Nitro Nutrient combo."

09:14.954 --> 09:18.549
Right. The customers have to have
confidence in you and the product,

09:18.624 --> 09:21.684
so don't be afraid to really
just put yourself out there!

09:21.761 --> 09:24.229
Tired of sticking
your finger down your throat?

09:24.297 --> 09:28.028
Wanna lose weight the easy way?
Ask me how! Herbalux can help!

09:29.402 --> 09:31.836
That's a good line. I might use it.

09:31.904 --> 09:34.236
Now you are ready
for your secret weapon.

09:34.307 --> 09:37.470
- "Ten pounds in ten days!"
- God. Do I really need to wear that?

09:37.543 --> 09:39.738
I remember when I got pinned.

09:39.812 --> 09:41.905
Shelley Jenkins did me the honor.

09:41.981 --> 09:44.006
Did she get you a limo and corsage?

09:45.818 --> 09:49.515
- Can I go and humiliate myself now?
- Yes. Yes, you may.

09:49.889 --> 09:53.882
Shelley always said, "Hit 'em with
the appetite suppressants before lunch!"

09:56.262 --> 09:58.321
Happy Herbalux-ing!

10:11.477 --> 10:13.468
- Good morning, Marc.
- [Woman] Thanks.

10:13.546 --> 10:15.844
I have something
that might interest you.

10:15.915 --> 10:18.975
Unless it's Taye Diggs
covered in baby oil, I doubt it.

10:19.051 --> 10:21.042
You're enjoying a healthy smoothie.

10:21.120 --> 10:24.817
Scientists are making great strides
in the health supplement market.

10:24.890 --> 10:28.087
Most of them work in the
Herbalux lab in Hoboken, New Jersey.

10:28.160 --> 10:31.095
- In fact, Herbalux...
- Would you please just...?

10:32.298 --> 10:34.766
Ten pounds?

10:34.834 --> 10:37.359
- Reach for the stars.
- Marc.

10:37.436 --> 10:39.495
We have phone calls to make,
don't we?

10:39.572 --> 10:41.403
Yeah.

10:41.574 --> 10:43.872
Work those halls,
you little diet diva!

10:52.518 --> 10:56.113
I don't like it when she smiles.
It's so metallic.

10:56.188 --> 10:57.382
What did she want?

10:57.456 --> 11:00.983
Looks like she's trying to earn
a few extra pesos for something.

11:01.060 --> 11:02.857
Interesting.

11:03.896 --> 11:06.490
What's the status on
the list of boarding schools?

11:06.565 --> 11:08.226
London and Milan passed.

11:08.300 --> 11:12.066
There's still one school in Paris
that hasn't heard of Nico... I think.

11:12.605 --> 11:15.096
<i>C'est parfait. Get them on the phone.</i>

11:15.708 --> 11:18.006
Oh! And before I forget,

11:18.077 --> 11:22.173
your meeting with Daniel's been pushed.
He's at a meeting in Bradford's office.

11:22.248 --> 11:24.148
Editors-in-chief only.

11:24.884 --> 11:27.375
Well, I'm sure Skippy
is holding his own.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.925
My pleasure.

11:45.404 --> 11:47.565
I like mine black, two sugars.

11:48.674 --> 11:50.471
You want me to get you coffee?

11:50.543 --> 11:52.977
I think that's why you're here.

11:53.045 --> 11:55.912
And what gave it away?
Was it my accent?

11:55.981 --> 12:00.680
Actually, you're the only person here
who doesn't edit a Meade Publication.

12:00.753 --> 12:03.586
You're an editor.

12:03.656 --> 12:07.092
Wow. I bet that gets you
all the girls, huh?

12:07.159 --> 12:11.061
Usually my magazine's
circulation count does the trick.

12:11.130 --> 12:13.758
Circulation count.

12:13.833 --> 12:16.495
Why, is it big?

12:16.569 --> 12:19.060
Well, I don't like to brag,

12:19.138 --> 12:22.767
but I am in the top five.

12:22.842 --> 12:25.402
Oh, my God. Listen, I'm sorry.

12:25.478 --> 12:29.437
I'm new here, and I'm not really
that familiar with everyone yet.

12:29.515 --> 12:33.315
<i>- Of course. I'm...
- Daniel Meade. Mode magazine.</i>

12:33.385 --> 12:37.116
The only one in this room
who was born into his job.

12:37.323 --> 12:40.258
[Bradford] All right,
let's get started, everyone.

12:41.494 --> 12:45.521
I have news.
Some might call it exciting news.

12:45.598 --> 12:49.500
In January, Meade Publishing
launches a new weekly,

12:49.568 --> 12:53.698
targeting "the empowered, modern
woman." You'll get the press release.

12:53.773 --> 12:58.107
The point is I wish to introduce
best-selling author and editorial brains

12:58.177 --> 13:00.737
<i>behind our new magazine, MYW,</i>

13:00.813 --> 13:02.838
- Sofia Reyes.
- [Crowd applauds]

13:02.915 --> 13:05.145
Sofia, what's the name of your new book?

13:05.818 --> 13:08.514
<i>Making Your Man a Bottom.</i>

13:09.922 --> 13:11.913
[Exhales deeply]

13:12.491 --> 13:15.756
And Herba-aid doesn't just hydrate.
It contains proteins,

13:15.828 --> 13:18.353
which helps repair

13:18.430 --> 13:20.728
- Terrific.
- I told you, you can't be here.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.927
What is your problem? I was mid-sale!

13:23.002 --> 13:25.698
- Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Do you want me to call the cops?

13:25.771 --> 13:29.400
- What could you possibly tell them?
- This doesn't concern you, ma'am.

13:29.475 --> 13:33.809
I'll worry about that. You worry about
calling me "ma'am" and getting hit.

13:33.879 --> 13:36.575
- I was gonna leave anyway, so...
- Stay where you are.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.412
You need to apologize.

13:38.484 --> 13:39.542
- Oh, me?
- Yeah.

13:39.618 --> 13:41.711
- She's breaking the law.
- Legal expert,

13:41.787 --> 13:45.018
tell me what it says in subchapter 27
of chapter two of title 20

13:45.090 --> 13:48.651
of the administrative code
on occupational licensing of vendors?

13:48.727 --> 13:50.695
Or how about the Constitution?

13:50.763 --> 13:53.891
Little thing called
"freedom of assembly"?

13:56.035 --> 13:57.627
Yeah, well...

13:57.703 --> 13:59.796
...you can forget about your free towel!

14:02.708 --> 14:04.471
That was amazing!

14:04.543 --> 14:08.536
Don't tell him, but that subchapter
applies to disabled veterans only.

14:08.614 --> 14:11.674
- How you doing? I'm Leah.
- Hi! I'm Hilda.

14:12.918 --> 14:14.818

- Yeah.

- Sure.

14:18.824 --> 14:21.520
- Hello?
- She's wearing a wedding ring, Hilda.

14:21.594 --> 14:24.256
- What are you talking about?
- The picture of Mom.

14:24.330 --> 14:27.788
- She's wearing a wedding ring.
- So it's a picture of Mom and Dad.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.892
No, they weren't married in '75.

14:29.969 --> 14:32.403
Dad said it was an
old picture of her boyfriend!

14:32.471 --> 14:35.634
- Give me one second?
- I gotta go. If you need anything call.

14:35.708 --> 14:38.006
Truth is, best place to find me is here,

14:38.077 --> 14:40.705
- I get my yoga on 8:00 every morning.
- OK, thank you!

14:40.779 --> 14:43.873
- Hilda, are you listening?
- I heard you. Mystery photo.

14:43.949 --> 14:46.611
Stop playing Nancy Drew.
You're supposed to sell.

14:46.685 --> 14:48.175
So how are you doing?

14:48.854 --> 14:50.617
Betty? What are your numbers?

14:50.689 --> 14:54.352
Christina bought $10 worth of
protein bars. She likes the taste.

14:54.426 --> 14:56.758
Of course, she eats sheep's stomach.

14:56.829 --> 14:58.854
Ten bucks? Great.

14:58.931 --> 15:03.459
Well, Dad could buy a set of maracas

Good. While you've been playing Mommy,

I've been planning
something for Bradford.

15:26.759 --> 15:29.353
That's right,
today's his special day, huh?

15:29.428 --> 15:31.191
I wonder how he'll celebrate.

15:31.263 --> 15:36.257
I'm sure the way Bradford Meade and Fey
Sommers always celebrated birthdays...

<i>- Anything I can do to help?
- No.</i>

15:40.506 --> 15:44.272
It's a birthday date for two only.

15:44.343 --> 15:47.642
I am more concerned with what
you have planned for Daniel.

15:47.713 --> 15:50.546
<i>He seems to be finding
his footing there these days.</i>

15:51.083 --> 15:54.917
You do realize it will be impossible
for us to take over the company

15:54.987 --> 15:57.455
if he's got any power there.

15:57.523 --> 16:02.460
I know. The little nugget
remains a threat to our plans.

But, short of taking
a bat to his knees...

16:05.297 --> 16:07.265
I like where you're going...

16:07.333 --> 16:09.233
It just occurred to me,

16:09.301 --> 16:12.429
maybe the one thing we can exploit

16:12.504 --> 16:15.905
is the person who's been
propping him up all this time.

like a complete ass.

- Not the women you usually date.

Didn't I ask you
to find out who she was?

16:38.364 --> 16:40.389
Yes, I'm sorry, some things came up.

16:40.466 --> 16:42.832
Besides, a no-shirt hottie
with an accent?

16:42.901 --> 16:45.529
That's every model who
walks through this office.

16:45.604 --> 16:48.129
You could've been
a little bit more specific.

- None.

like no one I've ever met.

She was ten steps ahead of me

- No, I can't just apologize.

- You put me in here.
- There must've been some mistake.

17:48.167 --> 17:51.830
Obviously, you were unaware
the dress had been placed in your bag.

17:51.904 --> 17:55.567
- No. I shoved it in there.
- Clearly you thought you'd paid for it.

17:55.641 --> 17:59.975
- We'll just forget this whole mess.
- You talked to my mother, didn't you?

18:00.045 --> 18:04.004
This store considers Ms. Slater
to be one of its dearest friends.

18:04.083 --> 18:07.109

Oh. She sent her bitch.

- Hilda...
- The more we argue, the less we sell.

18:47.426 --> 18:51.556
Are you serious about this? Because
I tried. It is just really demeaning.

No, I know that. But do you know
what number one on my "must list" is?

Get my dad a lawyer. This could be
the answer to my family's problems.

- Enough about the mystery photo.

- Enough about the evil queen's check.
- So, what am I supposed to do?

23:52.864 --> 23:57.301
It's half-price night at the Rack, which
is why I dragged you here, to let go.

I'm making that the number-one priority
on your "must list" tonight.

- Why do you think God invented alcohol?

I had work to do.
Furs for the Must List.

24:34.539 --> 24:36.837
- Care to look at them?
- Fur is murder.

I bought you a Nicole Miller
fur coat for your tenth birthday.

How could I forget?

24:41.780 --> 24:43.543
It was my 11th birthday.

24:43.615 --> 24:48.518
You had me model it for a photo shoot,
which you didn't even show up for.

24:48.587 --> 24:52.353
I believe the excuse was
dinner with Oscar de la Renta.

24:52.424 --> 24:55.154
Well, someone had to convince him that

24:55.227 --> 24:57.593

24:57.662 --> 24:59.721
Nice to know you have priorities.

25:01.032 --> 25:02.590
Kind of like today.

25:02.667 --> 25:07.036
Oh, that's right. Today was
your little cry for help, wasn't it?

25:07.105 --> 25:09.403
That was amateur, darling.

Afterwards, I was caught doing
a little dance of my own for Misha.

Now, that is acting out.

25:26.424 --> 25:29.825
- How proud you must be.
- You don't get it, do you?

25:29.895 --> 25:32.728
Act out as much as you want. I did.

25:32.797 --> 25:36.733
Seven schools until it finally hit me,

25:36.801 --> 25:39.531
until I finally understood.

25:39.604 --> 25:43.802
Being away from home, being away from
the ones you love, makes you strong.

25:44.175 --> 25:46.666
Builds your armor.

25:46.745 --> 25:48.372
Because in the end,

you can depend on is yourself.

the senator ever taught me.

- Brush up on your French.

in Paris tomorrow night.

26:17.876 --> 26:19.707
The flag was kind of at half mast.

26:19.778 --> 26:22.747
Would it be generic if I sent you
a necklace from Tiffany?

26:22.814 --> 26:25.248
Oh, no, I loved it.

26:25.317 --> 26:28.218
You sent it to me after
our first night together.

26:28.286 --> 26:29.947
Of course I did.

26:30.021 --> 26:32.387
And if I sent it to you as a...

26:32.457 --> 26:35.290
...sort of an apology,
that would be OK, right?

26:35.360 --> 26:37.021
Well, that depends.

26:37.095 --> 26:40.292
Are you apologizing
for something in particular?

26:41.266 --> 26:45.066
Yeah. Making an ass
out of myself with Sofia Reyes,

26:48.607 --> 26:52.202
I sent her a necklace as an apology
gift, and she called me out on it.

26:53.612 --> 26:54.909
Oh.

26:54.980 --> 26:59.212
So the whole apology thing
was about her, not me.

26:59.284 --> 27:01.377
What do I have to
apologize to you about?

27:01.453 --> 27:03.045
Nothing...

27:04.289 --> 27:05.916
...I guess.

27:07.492 --> 27:09.756
You know, I'm not feeling too well.

27:09.828 --> 27:12.319
- I think I'm gonna go.
- You OK?

27:12.397 --> 27:16.800
Yeah. I... I think I feel
one of those 24-hour flus coming on.

27:16.868 --> 27:19.302
I should go before I get you sick.

27:55.774 --> 27:57.435
Oops.

27:57.742 --> 27:59.733
That step's a tough one.

27:59.811 --> 28:02.575
Why are you sneaking in
through the back?

28:02.647 --> 28:05.377
- Are you drunk?
- Yeah, a little bit.

28:05.450 --> 28:07.816
- I'm going to bed.
- Let me get you some water.

28:07.886 --> 28:10.946
- No, I'm fine. Dad, let me go!
- What's the matter with you?

28:11.022 --> 28:14.253
- What's going on? Talk to me!
- Talk to you?

28:14.325 --> 28:16.259
Why don't you talk to me?

28:16.327 --> 28:20.024
Why don't you tell me why Mom is wearing
a wedding band in this picture?

28:22.600 --> 28:25.194
Or who's the guy in
the photo with her really?

28:30.542 --> 28:31.975
There you go.

28:32.043 --> 28:34.944
I don't have to explain myself to you.
I'm your father!

28:35.013 --> 28:37.413
Then act like it!

28:38.483 --> 28:42.852
I've always looked up to you, Dad.
Right, wrong, I could take your lead.

28:45.990 --> 28:47.787
Now, I'm lost.

28:57.268 --> 29:00.101
- A little less slamming, please.
- Mm-hm.

29:01.172 --> 29:04.198
Here. You're gonna need this.

29:04.275 --> 29:05.742
Thanks.

29:05.810 --> 29:07.300
So...

29:08.213 --> 29:11.080
...Dad left early.
- I don't want to talk about this.

29:11.149 --> 29:13.049
It's a little too late for that, now.

29:13.118 --> 29:15.678
I heard what you said last night.

29:16.287 --> 29:19.188
- So did half of Rego Park.
- I'm sorry.

29:19.257 --> 29:22.624
Apologizing to me
isn't gonna change what happened.

29:22.694 --> 29:25.720
What went on after
I left the office yesterday?

29:25.797 --> 29:27.389
I got punished.

one of those Ed McMahon things?

29:42.280 --> 29:45.477
Lt'll cash. Twenty grand.

29:45.550 --> 29:47.882
So cash it!
This is the answer to...

29:47.952 --> 29:49.613
Hilda, look closer.

29:52.290 --> 29:54.349
Wilhelmina Slater?

29:55.527 --> 29:58.553
- Oh, that stuck-up...
- Exactly.

29:59.931 --> 30:03.458
She'll want me to sell Daniel out,
so she can take his job.

30:07.172 --> 30:08.730
Her money, my soul.

30:08.840 --> 30:11.832
Look, I'm gonna try and
figure something else out, OK?

30:11.910 --> 30:14.003
See if there's another way.

30:15.513 --> 30:17.708
But this might be our only option.

What the hell just happened?

31:10.368 --> 31:13.804
You're getting back at me, aren't you?
For yesterday.

31:13.872 --> 31:15.339
You planned this.

31:15.406 --> 31:18.967
Planned this? Yeah, I got
a side job with the elevator union.

31:19.043 --> 31:21.568
Really? I'll take the stairs next time.

31:21.646 --> 31:24.547
- Do you always get the last word in?
- Only with you, baby.

31:25.016 --> 31:26.779
Great. Last time this happened,

31:26.851 --> 31:30.150
it was four hours of Kevin Federline
trying to cornrow my hair.

31:30.221 --> 31:32.246
No reception. What now?

31:32.323 --> 31:34.348
We're between floors.
If I get up there,

31:34.425 --> 31:36.586
I could pry the door open
on the next floor.

do the obvious?

31:50.541 --> 31:52.634
Come on, give me a boost.

31:52.710 --> 31:55.008
- Are you serious?
- On your knees.

31:56.948 --> 32:00.975
- And, Daniel, don't look up.
- Don't flatter yourself.

32:01.286 --> 32:03.481
Good.

another free towel?

32:46.030 --> 32:48.123
No. I really want to talk to you.

32:49.667 --> 32:51.794
Have you ever done
any immigration work?

32:51.869 --> 32:53.496

Besides, once I got my degree,
my Uncle Abraham

turned his place into
the Israeli underground railroad.

32:59.043 --> 33:00.908
Are you in some kind of trouble?

33:02.613 --> 33:07.016
If I tell you something, do we have
that attorney-client privilege thing?

33:07.085 --> 33:09.383
- That only works if I'm your lawyer.
- Right.

33:09.454 --> 33:11.354
For now, you got something stronger.

33:11.422 --> 33:15.222
My word. That'll only cost
you a cup of coffee and a bialy.

33:15.293 --> 33:17.625
I don't feel like working out, anyway.

33:26.270 --> 33:31.173

- No, I haven't really had a chance.

- No, we'll talk now.

- I am your mother.
- Mother?

35:14.979 --> 35:17.277
Then maybe you should act like it.

a clue where to start.

her crying when he hit her.
