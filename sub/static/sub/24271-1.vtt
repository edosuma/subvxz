<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

00:19.003 --> 00:20.836
<i>please welcome
movie star extraordinaire,</i>

00:20.838 --> 00:22.638
<i>Vic Edwards!</i>

00:25.442 --> 00:26.842
<i>I think people
are always fascinated</i>

00:26.844 --> 00:29.378
about how people
get into movies.

00:29.380 --> 00:31.380
I gather
your first screen test

00:31.382 --> 00:32.951
was a fair-sized experience.

00:33.953 --> 00:36.153
Yeah, it was. My, uh...

00:36.155 --> 00:38.788
My screen test was

00:38.790 --> 00:40.489
sad and funny.
I hope it's funny.

00:40.491 --> 00:43.127
<i>I went into 20th Century Fox
on an interview.</i>

00:43.129 --> 00:46.163
<i>First guy said,
"You have a very good face,"</i>

00:46.165 --> 00:48.900
<i>and he said, "We'd like to do
a screen test of you."</i>

00:48.902 --> 00:50.901
<i>Then I thought,
"Man, I'm gonna be a star."</i>

00:52.037 --> 00:52.904
<i>So on the day
of the screen test,</i>

00:52.906 --> 00:54.139
<i>I'm gonna get a haircut.</i>

00:54.141 --> 00:55.573
<i>So I duck into
this barber shop</i>

00:55.575 --> 00:56.908
<i>at 7:00 in the morning</i>

00:56.910 --> 00:58.310
<i>and I say to the guy, uh...</i>

00:58.312 --> 00:59.378
"Give me a haircut and shave."

00:59.380 --> 01:01.881
I'd never had a shave
in a barber shop before.

01:01.883 --> 01:03.548
And the guy had
never given one before.

01:04.818 --> 01:07.553
And he gave me
the worst haircut

01:07.555 --> 01:08.755
you've ever seen in your life.

01:08.757 --> 01:11.558
And then he... There was cuts
all over my face.

01:11.560 --> 01:12.892
And I had pieces
of toilet paper

01:12.894 --> 01:14.360
pasted all on my face.

01:16.430 --> 01:17.764
That was my test.

01:17.766 --> 01:19.333
And I wondered
why they didn't sign me

01:19.335 --> 01:20.902
for a seven year contract.

01:20.904 --> 01:23.738
That was my introduction
to the movies.

01:53.871 --> 01:55.306
Yeah.

01:59.044 --> 02:02.314
Squanto.
Squanto Edwards.

02:03.648 --> 02:07.152
Well, his kidneys
are completely shutting down.

02:07.154 --> 02:09.753
He's not responding
to the diuretics anymore.

02:09.756 --> 02:11.055
And you know
had to take him off

02:11.056 --> 02:12.823
the ACE inhibitors
for his heart disease

02:12.825 --> 02:15.162
because it's making
his kidney damage worse.

02:16.329 --> 02:18.933
His body
is basically poisoning itself.

02:20.168 --> 02:23.001
I mean, he's 15,
so he's not really a candidate

02:23.003 --> 02:25.603
for something more aggressive
like a transplant.

02:34.182 --> 02:37.119
What would you do,
if it was your dog?

02:38.319 --> 02:40.522
I'm afraid
we're out of options.

02:41.756 --> 02:43.193
I'd have to let him go.

02:46.328 --> 02:47.498
Yes.

02:49.933 --> 02:51.936
Well...

02:53.503 --> 02:54.940
Do you mind if I

02:56.339 --> 02:58.307
say good-bye to him alone?

02:58.309 --> 03:01.146
Yeah, of course. We'll give
you a minute to say good-bye.

05:18.627 --> 05:19.962
Eh...

05:30.941 --> 05:32.109
Phew...

06:28.603 --> 06:30.206
Mmm.

07:35.408 --> 07:39.813
- Nice view, huh?
- Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm.

07:41.415 --> 07:43.582
I always loved yoga.

07:43.584 --> 07:47.520
Oh, yeah. Thinking I'm having,
uh, palpitation.

07:47.522 --> 07:49.024
Mmm.

07:50.791 --> 07:52.358
Say, Vic, did you hear

07:52.360 --> 07:54.194
that Jerry Renner
died yesterday?

07:54.196 --> 07:56.463
Oh, that's too bad.

07:56.465 --> 07:57.834
Yeah, he was a nice guy.

07:58.434 --> 07:59.969
No, he wasn't.

08:00.636 --> 08:02.636
He was a putz.

08:06.875 --> 08:08.976
Oh, here.

08:08.978 --> 08:10.777
Forgot to show you this.

08:10.779 --> 08:13.283
This was sent to me.
What do you think?

08:13.949 --> 08:15.649
I don't know
how they got my address

08:15.651 --> 08:17.385
but they sent it to me.

08:17.387 --> 08:19.722
This is the International
Nashville Film Festival.

08:19.724 --> 08:21.790
You're being honored.

08:21.792 --> 08:24.059
"This year is being dedicated
to honoring you

08:24.061 --> 08:25.994
"and your impressive
body of work.

08:25.996 --> 08:27.061
"It's about time.

08:27.063 --> 08:29.297
- Ah, so what?
- "We would like to invite you

08:29.299 --> 08:30.367
"to join us for
a retrospective

08:30.369 --> 08:31.834
of some of your greatest films

08:31.836 --> 08:34.404
"followed by a gala ceremony
where you'll be presented

08:34.405 --> 08:37.472
"with our prestigious
Lifetime Achievement Award."

08:37.475 --> 08:39.475
Look who the previous
winners are,

08:39.477 --> 08:41.210
Robert De Niro, Jack Nicholson

08:41.212 --> 08:42.312
and Clint Eastwood.

08:42.313 --> 08:44.181
And it says here
all expenses are paid.

08:44.183 --> 08:47.317
That's a country music town,
that's not a film town.

08:47.319 --> 08:48.686
No, no, no, no.

08:48.688 --> 08:51.388
Nashville has become very hip.
Very hip.

08:51.390 --> 08:53.324
Well, that's what
I'm worried about.

08:53.326 --> 08:54.426
My hip.

08:54.428 --> 08:57.229
Sitting on an airplane
for too long a time,

08:57.231 --> 08:59.865
what if I get a clot
in my butt?

08:59.867 --> 09:01.566
Look, I've heard
of this film festival

09:01.568 --> 09:03.701
and I know
this is a prestigious award.

09:03.703 --> 09:05.605
And I don't think you're gonna
get a clot in your butt.

09:07.208 --> 09:09.008
Look, I'm just saying
if you don't go,

09:09.010 --> 09:10.579
you're a bigger asshole
than I ever thought.

09:11.012 --> 09:14.349
Well, I guess you would know.

09:17.084 --> 09:19.586
You've made
such great career moves.

09:55.493 --> 09:57.463
Nice. Schmuck.

11:02.699 --> 11:05.534
Good morning!
And where are we off to today?

11:05.536 --> 11:08.169
- Nashville.
- Nashville, huh?

11:08.171 --> 11:10.372
That's a great
live music town.

11:10.374 --> 11:12.741
You gonna kick
those heels up a little bit?

11:12.743 --> 11:15.410
Well, a very little bit.
There you go.

11:15.412 --> 11:18.518
- Thank you, Mr. Edwards.
- Mmm-hmm.

11:19.752 --> 11:22.553
There you are. Okay.

11:22.555 --> 11:25.488
I'm gonna have to ask you
to get in this line over here

11:25.490 --> 11:29.162
'cause this one is for
first class passengers only.

11:31.030 --> 11:34.200
Holy cow.
But I am first class.

12:59.626 --> 13:02.861
Yeah? Then why the hell
are there pictures of you two

13:02.863 --> 13:06.031
hugging and laughing
all over her Facebook page?

13:06.033 --> 13:07.635
Oh, bullshit!

13:08.702 --> 13:10.870
Don't tell me
I'm being irrational.

13:10.872 --> 13:13.139
You told me you were
going there with Andrew

13:13.141 --> 13:14.305
and you lied.

13:14.307 --> 13:16.174
It's just a simple fact.

13:16.176 --> 13:18.944
If you're just friends,
then why lie?

13:18.946 --> 13:20.546
Oh, you're so full of shit.

13:20.548 --> 13:22.782
You must think I'm the biggest
idiot on the planet.

13:22.784 --> 13:25.318
Look, I can't talk about this
right now. I'm working.

13:25.320 --> 13:26.953
I do, too, have a job.

13:26.955 --> 13:29.489
I'm picking up some
old asshole for my brother.

13:29.491 --> 13:30.724
I don't know who it is.

13:30.726 --> 13:33.161
I mean, what, do you think
I Google'd him or some shit?

13:33.163 --> 13:36.634
- Oh, what?
- Hi. I'm Vic Edwards.

13:37.833 --> 13:41.369
- Oh, Mr. Edwards.
- Yeah. Yeah.

13:41.371 --> 13:43.172
I... I have to call you back.

13:43.174 --> 13:44.740
- Hello, Mr. Edwards.
- Hi.

13:44.742 --> 13:47.308
Um, welcome to Nashville.
How was your flight?

13:47.310 --> 13:48.576
Was it delayed?

13:48.578 --> 13:50.712
I mean, I've been
waiting here forever.

13:50.714 --> 13:53.216
You've been waiting here
forever my ass.

13:53.218 --> 13:54.719
Now where is my limo?

13:56.188 --> 13:58.922
I don't know anything
about a limo.

13:58.924 --> 14:01.091
- Really?
- But I'm Lil McDougal,

14:01.093 --> 14:02.925
your personal assistant
and chauffeur

14:02.927 --> 14:04.896
for the duration
of the weekend.

14:05.431 --> 14:07.530
We're off to a great start,
aren't we?

14:11.403 --> 14:13.670
Bjorn, shut up. I'm working.

14:13.672 --> 14:15.039
- Come on!
- Hmm?

14:15.041 --> 14:16.877
Sorry. Sorry.
Come on. Let's go.

14:37.866 --> 14:38.931
All right.

14:38.933 --> 14:40.432
We'll get you
checked into the hotel

14:40.434 --> 14:41.701
but there's no time to relax.

14:41.703 --> 14:42.970
We've got to get
to the film festival in time

14:42.972 --> 14:45.773
for the opening ceremony and
we're running late already.

14:45.775 --> 14:47.477
Whose fault is that?

15:24.850 --> 15:26.418
This is an upgrade?

15:27.085 --> 15:28.588
What's wrong with it?
Look, it's got a kitchen.

15:29.923 --> 15:31.955
This is a kitchen?

15:31.957 --> 15:35.625
Are you familiar with the term
"false advertising"?

15:35.627 --> 15:36.629
Yeah.

15:37.297 --> 15:40.768
Well, I was promised
first class accommodation.

15:41.801 --> 15:43.434
I've got a good mind
to have you

15:43.436 --> 15:45.937
take me back
to the airport right now.

15:45.939 --> 15:48.041
It's like I'm on
<i>Candid Camera.</i>

15:48.608 --> 15:51.043
Is this really
a film festival?

15:51.045 --> 15:53.779
Dude, there's a film festival
and if you don't like

15:53.781 --> 15:55.948
your accommodations because
they don't measure up

15:55.950 --> 15:57.784
to your big
Hollywood expectations,

15:57.786 --> 15:59.284
don't gripe to me.

15:59.286 --> 16:00.620
I'm just your assistant 'cause
I'm the one with the car.

16:00.622 --> 16:03.155
Take it up with my brother.
It's his stupid film festival.

16:03.157 --> 16:06.526
- I'll meet you in the lobby.
- You call that a lobby?

16:06.528 --> 16:07.895
Your key. Really?

16:07.897 --> 16:10.030
I've seen phone booths
that were bigger than that.

16:10.032 --> 16:11.364
See you soon. Can't hear you.

16:11.366 --> 16:13.636
Yeah, right, right, right.

16:20.043 --> 16:21.508
What a shithole.

16:24.213 --> 16:25.913
Don't be crazy.

16:25.915 --> 16:28.049
You're there already.
Just enjoy it.

16:28.051 --> 16:31.052
Enjoy it? You should see
this rat hole.

16:31.054 --> 16:33.489
<i>It smells like piss
and Pine-Sol.</i>

16:33.491 --> 16:35.523
Well, you should feel
right at home then.

16:35.525 --> 16:37.592
<i>Those boutique hotels
are always small</i>

16:37.594 --> 16:38.860
<i>but they're very hip.</i>

16:38.862 --> 16:42.231
There's nothing hip or
boutique about this place.

16:42.233 --> 16:44.867
And my assistant, my God.

16:44.869 --> 16:48.237
She's just a basket case
on wheels.

16:48.239 --> 16:49.606
Oh, just relax, Vic.

16:49.608 --> 16:52.708
It's one lousy weekend and
you'll get to the festival,

16:52.710 --> 16:54.511
everybody will spoil you.

16:54.513 --> 16:56.881
You'll feel like a big shot.
How bad can it be?

16:56.883 --> 16:58.882
De Niro, Clint.

16:58.884 --> 17:00.251
There must be something to it.

17:00.253 --> 17:04.054
I guarantee you Clint
didn't stay in this shithole.

17:04.056 --> 17:05.423
<i>Oh, stop it.</i>

17:05.425 --> 17:07.125
I'll talk to you later.

17:07.127 --> 17:08.295
I'm sorry about that.

17:42.765 --> 17:44.801
You are such an asshole!

17:46.136 --> 17:48.936
Well, I was just sitting here
and the book was here...

17:48.938 --> 17:50.172
I'm not talking to you.

17:50.174 --> 17:52.606
No,
I am talking to you, Bjorn.

17:52.608 --> 17:53.846
Shut up for a second.

17:55.312 --> 17:56.948
I'm on the phone, Mr. Edwards.

17:57.314 --> 17:59.014
Yes, I can see that.

17:59.016 --> 18:00.184
Hello?

18:00.985 --> 18:02.184
Bjorn?

18:02.186 --> 18:04.925
Hello? Dammit!

18:29.217 --> 18:30.953
What the hell is this?

18:33.353 --> 18:34.689
This is the festival.

18:38.525 --> 18:39.992
But it's a bar.

18:39.994 --> 18:41.229
Yes. So what?

19:00.682 --> 19:02.083
There he is.

19:02.085 --> 19:04.718
Oh, my gosh. Mr. Edwards.

19:04.720 --> 19:06.755
I can't believe it.
Oh, my gosh.

19:06.757 --> 19:08.556
Vic Edwards!

19:08.558 --> 19:10.225
Oh, man, I can't tell you

19:10.227 --> 19:11.893
how excited we are
to have you here.

19:11.895 --> 19:13.195
I'm Doug McDougal.

19:13.197 --> 19:14.263
We spoke on the phone,
remember?

19:14.265 --> 19:17.232
- Yeah. How are you?
- I'm so good.

19:17.234 --> 19:19.402
I can't tell you what it means
to us that you're here.

19:19.404 --> 19:20.569
We're such fans.

19:20.571 --> 19:23.105
Let me introduce you to
my partner, Shane McAvoy.

19:23.107 --> 19:25.208
We have been best friends
since birth,

19:25.210 --> 19:27.043
so the first time
I saw any of your films,

19:27.045 --> 19:28.577
it was with
this guy right here.

19:28.579 --> 19:30.213
- Really? Wow.
- Yeah.

19:30.215 --> 19:33.584
Mr. Edwards, sir, your films
have influenced me greatly.

19:33.586 --> 19:35.086
Your performance in
<i>Siege at the Alamo</i>

19:35.088 --> 19:37.054
was a revelation of

19:37.056 --> 19:39.292
gradation and dynamism
and nuance.

19:39.892 --> 19:43.194
Gradation, dynamism, nuance?
Sounds like a law firm.

19:44.598 --> 19:46.131
Seriously, I get choked up

19:46.133 --> 19:47.766
even just thinking about
that scene

19:47.768 --> 19:50.301
where you're cradling
the dying Robert Mitchum.

19:50.303 --> 19:52.871
And you say,
"Mr. Crocket, sir,

19:52.873 --> 19:54.139
"it's been my privilege

19:54.141 --> 19:56.375
"defending Texas
side by side with you."

19:56.377 --> 19:58.610
All right, wrap it up, Shane.
This is Stuart.

19:58.612 --> 20:00.646
He's a local filmmaker
here in Nashville.

20:00.648 --> 20:02.214
He actually shot
all the promos

20:02.216 --> 20:03.250
for the festival
that are playing online.

20:03.252 --> 20:05.152
Did you get a chance
to catch any of those yet?

20:05.154 --> 20:08.387
No, I haven't, but I will.
What time do they come on?

20:08.389 --> 20:11.457
It's like I'm on <i>Carson.</i>

20:11.459 --> 20:13.993
<i>Mr. Edwards, it is
the greatest honor of my life</i>

20:13.995 --> 20:16.262
to be seeing you through
my viewfinder right now.

20:16.264 --> 20:18.632
I'm making a documentary
about this historic event.

20:18.634 --> 20:20.100
And, of course,
you know my sister Lil,

20:20.102 --> 20:21.336
<i>who, in addition to being</i>

20:21.338 --> 20:23.937
<i>your personal assistant for
the weekend, is an artist.</i>

20:23.939 --> 20:26.107
<i>She actually made
the logo for the festival.</i>

20:26.109 --> 20:29.677
Well, she was very handy.

20:29.679 --> 20:31.147
Well, she's been called worse.

20:31.149 --> 20:33.114
Uh, let's get you over
to the red carpet.

20:51.803 --> 20:54.205
So what is he like?
What'd you guys talk about?

20:54.207 --> 20:55.706
Did he tell you any stories?

20:55.708 --> 20:57.007
Oh, yeah. It was great.

20:57.009 --> 20:59.310
He told me how much
he hated the coach ticket

20:59.312 --> 21:00.611
and how much he hated
the hotel

21:00.613 --> 21:02.313
and how much he hated my car.

21:02.315 --> 21:04.515
And that the film festival's
in a bar.

21:04.517 --> 21:05.984
Yeah, he's a total dick.

21:05.986 --> 21:08.219
I have no idea what
you guys are so obsessed with.

21:08.221 --> 21:09.321
Maybe we should watch

21:09.323 --> 21:10.521
some of his movies together
some time.

21:10.523 --> 21:12.024
Yeah, I got to be
honest with you, Shane.

21:12.026 --> 21:13.725
I'm dealing with some shit
with Bjorn right now,

21:13.727 --> 21:15.227
so could you just run along?

21:15.229 --> 21:18.230
I'm not asking you on a date.
I'm just saying that...

21:18.232 --> 21:20.135
Yeah, that's great. Thanks.

21:28.175 --> 21:30.344
- Vic, you were great!
- Welcome to Nashville!

21:30.346 --> 21:33.183
- I'm sorry to, um...
- Who's that?

21:34.584 --> 21:36.317
<i>Mr. Edwards,
it's so nice to meet you.</i>

21:36.319 --> 21:38.888
<i>I'm a huge fan.
My dad loves your movies.</i>

22:19.431 --> 22:22.600
Okay, now, Mr. Edwards,
if we could, right this way.

22:22.602 --> 22:24.435
- Okay.
- I'd like to introduce you

22:24.437 --> 22:27.237
to our social media director
and my better half.

22:27.239 --> 22:30.141
- This is my girlfriend, Faith.
- Hi, Faith.

22:30.143 --> 22:33.611
Hi. Wow.
It's so exciting to meet you.

22:33.613 --> 22:36.651
All Doug keeps talking about
is Vic Edwards, Vic Edwards.

22:37.084 --> 22:39.818
And FYI, on Instagram,
Snapchat and Pinterest,

22:39.820 --> 22:41.321
my name is FaithVonAwesome

22:41.323 --> 22:43.957
but on Twitter, it's Faith,
underscore, VonAwesome.

22:43.959 --> 22:46.092
Someone else beat me to it.
But that's okay.

22:46.094 --> 22:47.494
And our Vines are hilarious.

22:47.496 --> 22:49.629
And our Facebook page
already has, like, 200 likes,

22:49.631 --> 22:51.563
so just feel free to
just invite all your friends.

22:51.565 --> 22:55.635
And, FYI, we've got a few
hashtags going, hashtag INFF,

22:55.637 --> 22:59.439
hashtag Nashfilm,
hashtag VicInNashville.

22:59.441 --> 23:01.475
So just feel free
to hashtag away

23:01.477 --> 23:03.313
on any of your pics
that you post, okay?

23:05.281 --> 23:07.415
- Thank you.
- Can I get you a drink?

23:07.417 --> 23:08.983
Yeah, I'll have a whiskey.

23:08.985 --> 23:11.353
- Aye, aye, sir. Okay.
- Okay.

23:11.355 --> 23:12.821
All right, Faith, actually,

23:12.823 --> 23:14.355
just bring it on
into the theater.

23:14.357 --> 23:15.457
Um, we've got tot get going.

23:15.459 --> 23:16.659
We've got a lot of movies
to get through

23:16.661 --> 23:18.428
before the big awards ceremony
on Sunday.

23:18.430 --> 23:20.496
<i>The screening room
right around here.</i>

23:20.498 --> 23:22.664
<i>There's actually a lot
of local contest winners</i>

23:22.666 --> 23:24.770
<i>and fans that are already
in there, waiting.</i>

23:25.502 --> 23:27.202
Excuse me.

23:27.204 --> 23:29.775
He's here.

23:54.502 --> 23:56.034
All right.
Thank you, everybody,

23:56.036 --> 23:57.470
for coming to the fifth annual

23:57.472 --> 23:59.704
International Nashville
Film Festival.

23:59.706 --> 24:01.743
Yeah.

24:03.878 --> 24:05.378
You know,
we've been doing this

24:05.380 --> 24:06.879
for a number of years now,

24:06.881 --> 24:10.649
but I have to say, it's never
been more exciting for me

24:10.651 --> 24:13.419
than this year because we have
with us our guest of honor,

24:13.421 --> 24:16.890
<i>the number one box office star
for five years in a row.</i>

24:16.892 --> 24:18.559
- <i>Six.</i>
- <i>Six. I'm sorry.</i>

24:18.561 --> 24:20.660
- <i>That's all right.</i>
- <i>Six years in a row.</i>

24:20.662 --> 24:23.363
<i>Tennessee's favorite son.
Movie star extraordinaire.</i>

24:23.365 --> 24:25.533
<i>Everybody, give it up
for Mr. Vic Edwards.</i>

24:30.507 --> 24:33.074
So, Vic, the opening movie
of the festival tonight

24:33.076 --> 24:36.378
is your 1961 classic,
<i>Nine Lives to Kathmandu</i>

24:36.380 --> 24:38.447
for which the Hollywood
Critics Association

24:38.449 --> 24:40.550
awarded you Best Newcomer
of the year.

24:40.552 --> 24:43.052
That's the only time I ever
agreed with the critics.

24:45.589 --> 24:48.293
<i>Oh, thank you. One second.</i>

24:52.264 --> 24:54.634
Oh. All right.

24:56.935 --> 24:58.869
Thank you.

24:58.871 --> 25:00.203
So, yeah, Vic, like I said,

25:00.205 --> 25:02.405
if you have any stories
or anecdotes

25:02.407 --> 25:03.606
about the making of that film,

25:03.608 --> 25:04.475
I think we'd all love
to hear 'em.

25:04.477 --> 25:06.111
I have a question.

25:06.113 --> 25:08.613
Please save any questions for
the Q&A after the film.

25:08.615 --> 25:11.615
Well, <i>Kathmandu</i>
was a B-picture,

25:11.617 --> 25:14.618
which means it didn't cost
much to make.

25:14.620 --> 25:17.088
Somehow,
it shot right to the top.

25:17.090 --> 25:20.092
One minute,
I was a two-bit stuntman

25:20.094 --> 25:21.794
and then the next minute,

25:21.796 --> 25:23.628
I was the toast of the town.

25:23.630 --> 25:25.664
Hollywood can do that.

25:25.666 --> 25:27.301
Wants to build you up,

25:28.002 --> 25:29.406
they can do it fast.

25:29.972 --> 25:32.572
And if they want you
to crash and burn,

25:32.574 --> 25:33.909
they do that even faster.

25:34.176 --> 25:35.741
Speaking of stunts, it is true

25:35.743 --> 25:37.176
that you doubled
Burt Lancaster

25:37.178 --> 25:38.345
in <i>Gunfight at the OK Corral?</i>

25:38.347 --> 25:41.515
Dammit, Shane. I said
no questions till the Q&A.

25:41.517 --> 25:44.685
That's all right.
Nobody doubled Burt.

25:44.687 --> 25:47.821
But I did double somebody
in that picture

25:47.823 --> 25:49.456
and that was Rhonda Fleming.

25:51.628 --> 25:53.462
I had to fall off a horse
in a dress.

25:55.366 --> 25:56.464
All right. Well, I don't know

25:56.466 --> 25:58.032
if it's gonna get
a lot better than that

25:58.034 --> 25:59.870
so let's begin the festival.

26:16.523 --> 26:19.126
Yeah!

26:23.862 --> 26:25.532
Excuse me.

27:04.106 --> 27:05.574
No, I've given you everything

27:05.576 --> 27:07.345
and you still cheated on me!

27:08.578 --> 27:11.011
You cheated on me!
I've given you everything!

27:11.013 --> 27:12.681
- I didn't have sex with her.
- You didn't have sex with her

27:12.683 --> 27:13.914
but you still
cheated on me with her.

27:13.916 --> 27:15.683
Give me a break. Look
at you, wearing those shorts

27:15.685 --> 27:16.786
with your ass hanging out

27:16.788 --> 27:18.287
with that stupid idiot
at this stupid place.

27:18.289 --> 27:19.454
What stupid place?

27:19.456 --> 27:21.089
You're always
screwing my friends!

27:21.091 --> 27:23.558
- I don't mean to.
- You're an asshole!

27:23.560 --> 27:24.894
- Get out of the way!
- Ahhh!

27:24.896 --> 27:26.295
You're a downer, all right?

27:26.297 --> 27:28.764
You're the one who
cheated on me! I hate you!

27:28.766 --> 27:31.233
You can't do this!
How dare you?

27:31.235 --> 27:32.972
After everything!

27:48.588 --> 27:51.492
You got shit taste for men,
you know that?

27:52.759 --> 27:54.592
Yeah? Tell me about it.

27:54.594 --> 27:56.661
Next time some guy
gives you a hard time,

27:56.663 --> 27:59.631
just jab him in the throat,
right in the Adam's apple,

27:59.633 --> 28:01.899
you know, with these
four fingers.

28:01.901 --> 28:05.138
Right there. He won't talk
for quite a few days.

28:05.140 --> 28:07.439
Yeah, well, it's not some guy.

28:07.441 --> 28:09.178
It's Bjorn, my boyfriend.

28:09.811 --> 28:12.682
Well, ex-boyfriend now.

28:13.015 --> 28:15.681
- Bjorn?
- It's Swedish.

28:15.683 --> 28:17.985
I know.
It's Swedish for "shit".

28:17.987 --> 28:20.454
Has he ever put his hands
on you before?

28:20.456 --> 28:23.924
You know, whatever.
I mean, he has to date me

28:23.926 --> 28:25.325
and I'm crazy so.

28:25.327 --> 28:28.498
Ah. So it's your fault?

28:29.799 --> 28:31.099
'Cause you're crazy.

28:31.101 --> 28:33.301
Yeah, you know what?
You don't get anything.

28:33.303 --> 28:35.469
And I don't need
psychoanalysis

28:35.471 --> 28:37.773
from some has-been actor
from Hollywood.

28:37.775 --> 28:39.541
And speaking of Hollywood,

28:39.543 --> 28:40.879
why the hell
are you even here?

28:42.012 --> 28:43.779
Well, I'm only here because

28:43.781 --> 28:46.284
Clint and Jack
and Bobby De Niro all came.

28:47.484 --> 28:49.118
- Clint Eastwood?
- Mmm-hmm.

28:49.120 --> 28:50.623
- Jack Nicholson?
- Yeah.

28:51.021 --> 28:53.156
Yeah. Mr. Edwards, this is

28:53.158 --> 28:55.124
the International
Nashville Film Festival,

28:55.126 --> 28:57.694
not the Nashville
International Film Festival.

28:57.696 --> 29:00.497
That's the big one. Yeah.
Those guys never came here.

29:00.499 --> 29:02.199
Said on the invite
they all won

29:02.201 --> 29:03.834
the same award
that I'm getting.

29:03.836 --> 29:07.038
My brother invited them.
He just never got a response.

29:07.040 --> 29:09.740
In the four years
he's been running it,

29:09.742 --> 29:13.647
you are the only one
stupid enough to show up.

29:14.847 --> 29:15.982
Huh.

29:40.709 --> 29:42.412
All right, huh?

29:47.382 --> 29:49.886
Ladies and gentlemen,
Vic Edwards.

29:54.091 --> 29:55.791
Where's Vic?

29:55.793 --> 29:59.227
<i>Uh, okay. Vic must be
in the bathroom or something.</i>

29:59.229 --> 30:00.696
Everybody sit tight.
I'm gonna go get him.

30:00.698 --> 30:02.766
I'll be right back. Come on.

30:13.144 --> 30:16.280
- Hey, where's Vic?
- I don't know. He left.

30:16.282 --> 30:17.751
What do you mean he left?

30:18.417 --> 30:21.054
He got up
and walked out the door.

30:21.487 --> 30:23.989
Well, why didn't you come
get me at least or something?

30:24.489 --> 30:26.759
And interrupt the movie?
God forbid.

30:28.126 --> 30:29.931
Dammit, Lil.

30:31.397 --> 30:33.265
- Vic!
- Mr. Edwards.

30:33.267 --> 30:35.570
He wants to be called Vic.
Vic!

30:38.404 --> 30:41.306
- Oh, my God.
- Holy shit. That's awesome.

30:41.308 --> 30:44.512
- <i>Come on, boy. Come on.</i>
- <i>Holy shit.</i>

30:45.113 --> 30:46.448
Dammit.

30:46.780 --> 30:49.347
Here you go. Yee-ha.

30:49.349 --> 30:50.682
Vic.

30:50.684 --> 30:52.819
Hey, Vic.

30:52.821 --> 30:56.989
- Um, Vic, you okay?
- Come on, big boy. Up.

30:56.991 --> 30:59.596
Silver.

31:00.128 --> 31:01.260
Everything all right?

31:01.262 --> 31:03.262
Of course I'm all right,
goddammit.

31:03.264 --> 31:07.935
Look at me. I'm riding like
a son-of-a-bitch.

31:07.937 --> 31:10.270
Go, baby. Yee-ha.

31:10.272 --> 31:13.141
You know what my first job
in movies was?

31:13.143 --> 31:14.675
Falling off a horse.

31:14.677 --> 31:18.047
Great. Uh, what do you say
we go do the Q&A, huh?

31:18.049 --> 31:21.016
<i>He's sloshed, man.</i>

31:21.018 --> 31:23.889
I am not sloshed.

31:24.455 --> 31:26.355
Anybody could
fall off a horse,

31:26.357 --> 31:29.725
but a good stuntman can do it
and get up and be okay.

31:29.727 --> 31:31.531
And that is the art.

31:32.831 --> 31:35.397
Oh. Awesome. Good to know.

31:35.399 --> 31:38.134
Stuntmen never get
the glory they deserve.

31:38.136 --> 31:40.503
I was always envious of them.

31:40.505 --> 31:42.505
I should have
stayed a stuntman.

31:42.507 --> 31:44.742
Maybe. Coulda, shoulda, right?

31:44.744 --> 31:47.211
You know, these would
actually be great anecdotes

31:47.213 --> 31:48.812
to tell at the Q&A.

31:48.814 --> 31:50.848
If you want... If you want
to head back inside.

31:50.850 --> 31:53.886
When I was starting out,
all they made were westerns.

31:53.888 --> 31:56.921
I didn't know a damn thing
about Hollywood.

31:56.923 --> 31:58.724
But I did know
how to ride a horse.

31:58.726 --> 32:00.993
So I snuck on
the Paramount lot

32:00.995 --> 32:02.159
and when I heard they were

32:02.161 --> 32:05.063
shooting a Hoppy movie,
I walked up to the guy,

32:05.065 --> 32:07.399
<i>shouting the loudest
and I said,</i>

32:07.401 --> 32:09.904
<i>"I'm the new stuntman."</i>

32:10.671 --> 32:13.238
Next thing I know,
I'm dressed like an Injun,

32:13.240 --> 32:18.245
riding a caramel stallion
across the Paramount ranch.

32:18.247 --> 32:21.383
And then I hear my cue. Bang!

32:22.517 --> 32:24.752
And you know what I did then?

32:24.754 --> 32:27.357
Fell off the horse.

32:28.057 --> 32:31.194
Bet I could still do it.
Yell "Bang."

32:32.128 --> 32:33.260
I'm sorry, what?

32:33.262 --> 32:35.031
Yell "Bang."

32:35.766 --> 32:37.465
Bang.

32:37.467 --> 32:39.103
Oh, my God.

32:41.471 --> 32:43.107
Very good, guys.

32:43.641 --> 32:45.477
<i>Careful, Vic.</i>

32:45.910 --> 32:47.108
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

32:47.110 --> 32:49.077
Ladies and gentlemen,
Vic Edwards.

33:05.932 --> 33:09.166
Okay, as promised,
Vic is gonna do a short Q&A.

33:09.168 --> 33:11.102
Vic, your co-star in <i>Kathmandu</i>

33:11.104 --> 33:13.104
was the lovely
and talented Virginia Donovan.

33:13.106 --> 33:14.905
The studio PR department
at the time

33:14.907 --> 33:16.308
played you guys up as an item.

33:16.310 --> 33:18.010
Was there any truth
to that rumor?

33:18.012 --> 33:19.845
Or was that just
Hollywood hype?

33:19.847 --> 33:21.747
No, I banged her brains out.

33:23.117 --> 33:26.617
But the rumors that
we were dating was bullshit.

33:26.619 --> 33:28.088
Look,
I'll give it to you straight

33:28.090 --> 33:30.623
because I'm too old
to give you any crap.

33:30.625 --> 33:33.659
When you're famous,
everybody wants to screw you.

33:33.661 --> 33:35.160
Hmm.

33:35.162 --> 33:37.129
<i>So I porked about
every starlet in Hollywood.</i>

33:37.131 --> 33:38.098
<i>Every cover girl.</i>

33:38.100 --> 33:40.667
<i>Every cute extra.
Every hot waitress.</i>

33:40.669 --> 33:44.105
There was one make-up girl
on the set of <i>No Can Do,</i>

33:44.107 --> 33:46.206
what a set of bonkers there.

33:46.208 --> 33:49.209
They should have declared
national treasures.

33:49.211 --> 33:53.681
Probably look like saggy socks
over the menorah now but...

33:53.683 --> 33:55.452
What was the question again?

33:57.955 --> 34:01.055
Uh... All right.
Any other questions?

34:01.057 --> 34:02.157
Yes, Shane.

34:02.159 --> 34:04.994
Um, at the onset
of your career,

34:04.996 --> 34:06.896
you were known as
an actor's actor.

34:06.898 --> 34:08.330
You even studied
with Stella Adler.

34:08.331 --> 34:09.967
Yeah. Bitch.

34:10.801 --> 34:12.034
You were compared
to Brando even.

34:12.036 --> 34:13.803
But somewhere along the way,

34:13.804 --> 34:16.139
you started choosing to do
more action-y films

34:16.141 --> 34:17.541
instead of
the character pieces.

34:17.543 --> 34:18.675
Why is that?

34:18.677 --> 34:20.376
And is it true
that you turned down

34:20.378 --> 34:22.081
<i>Serpico</i> for <i>Johnny Speedway?</i>

34:25.717 --> 34:27.516
Well, you know,
it's getting kind of late.

34:27.518 --> 34:28.752
We got a big day tomorrow

34:28.754 --> 34:30.254
so I think maybe, um...

34:30.255 --> 34:31.688
But, you know, he's right.

34:31.690 --> 34:34.759
Pacino, De Niro, Brando.

34:34.761 --> 34:36.429
They picked the right ones.

34:37.563 --> 34:39.065
Bad choices.

34:44.605 --> 34:46.041
Bad choices.

34:54.917 --> 34:57.417
<i>Well, I think, uh,
I speak for all of us</i>

34:57.419 --> 35:00.252
<i>when I say that you definitely
made the right choices</i>

35:00.254 --> 35:02.022
because we love
all your films, right?

35:05.462 --> 35:06.730
Yeah.

35:07.797 --> 35:09.132
Speaking of De Niro,

35:10.467 --> 35:13.233
you sold me a bill of goods,
you little asshole.

35:13.235 --> 35:14.869
I'm sorry, what?

35:14.871 --> 35:18.240
Well, you let me believe
that Clint and Bobby and Jack

35:18.242 --> 35:20.242
all came on to accept
their awards here.

35:20.244 --> 35:22.377
And they never been here.

35:22.379 --> 35:25.247
I never said they came here.
To be clear.

35:25.249 --> 35:28.384
Uh, I just said we had
given them the awards.

35:28.386 --> 35:30.652
What are you
trying to do, humiliate me?

35:30.654 --> 35:33.255
Cannes.
That was a film festival.

35:33.257 --> 35:35.558
Venice,
that was a film festival.

35:35.560 --> 35:38.561
<i>But this is just
a bunch of losers</i>

35:38.563 --> 35:40.467
<i>watching movies
in their basement.</i>

35:46.439 --> 35:48.942
Screw it.

35:51.476 --> 35:53.180
Holy shit!

36:04.324 --> 36:06.194
All righty, Vic,
nighty night.

36:06.494 --> 36:09.195
Lil's gonna be here at noon
to pick you up.

36:09.197 --> 36:11.296
We'll go get some
famous Nashville barbecue

36:11.298 --> 36:13.798
<i>and then we got a big day
of screenings tomorrow.</i>

36:13.800 --> 36:16.703
When you show a movie
on a theater screen,

36:16.705 --> 36:18.337
it's a screening.

36:18.339 --> 36:21.274
But when you project a movie
on the wall,

36:21.276 --> 36:23.178
it's pathetic.

36:23.479 --> 36:25.111
You know,
we're just starting out.

36:25.113 --> 36:27.714
We're doing the best we can
with the money that we have.

36:27.716 --> 36:30.351
Your whole stupid
little festival is a joke.

36:30.353 --> 36:32.387
I get it now.

36:32.389 --> 36:35.956
The joke's on me.
You guys are messing with me.

36:35.958 --> 36:39.126
No, no, Mr. Edwards.
It's nothing like that.

36:39.128 --> 36:41.964
Put it on the YouTube and the
whole world will laugh at it.

36:41.966 --> 36:43.332
Vic, we're your biggest fans.

36:43.334 --> 36:44.899
We would never do
anything like that.

36:44.901 --> 36:47.203
<i>Uh-huh. Well, that's why
this asshole's</i>

36:47.205 --> 36:49.370
<i>following me around
with that camera.</i>

36:49.372 --> 36:51.840
Get that out of my face.

36:51.842 --> 36:53.143
No, no, Mr. Edwards.
Mr. Edwards.

36:53.145 --> 36:54.376
Mr. Edwards, please.

36:54.378 --> 36:55.844
<i>No, no, Vic, Vic, please.</i>

36:55.846 --> 36:58.215
It's a liability thing.
I don't think we should fight.

37:11.396 --> 37:12.565
You're a jerk.

37:13.233 --> 37:15.766
- Doug!
- No. No, Shane.

37:15.768 --> 37:18.337
I've had it. I mean,
he just broke Stuart's camera.

37:18.339 --> 37:20.438
You want to know the real
reason we brought you here?

37:20.440 --> 37:22.373
Yes, because I'm stupid enough
to come.

37:22.375 --> 37:26.277
Because we're fans, okay?
Because we love your movies.

37:26.279 --> 37:28.180
Because we think
you're a great actor.

37:28.182 --> 37:29.548
And we save all our money

37:29.550 --> 37:31.084
and we throw
this film festival every year.

37:31.086 --> 37:33.885
And, yeah, maybe some aspects
of it are a little low rent.

37:33.887 --> 37:35.555
- A little?
- But I was really excited

37:35.557 --> 37:36.789
when you agreed to come.

37:36.791 --> 37:38.791
Now I wish
that I hadn't even invited you

37:38.793 --> 37:39.960
because you're ruining
the whole thing.

37:39.962 --> 37:42.029
I wish you'd never invited me,
either.

37:42.031 --> 37:43.266
Well, I did!

37:44.065 --> 37:45.801
And you're here.

37:46.402 --> 37:47.737
So, tough titty.

37:48.471 --> 37:50.737
- Ah.
- All right, look.

37:50.739 --> 37:54.309
We've got a big day tomorrow,
"showings" of your movies,

37:54.311 --> 37:55.910
so suck it up, okay?

37:55.912 --> 37:58.113
I'm so sorry you've got
to spend the weekend

37:58.115 --> 37:59.314
being loved
and adored by everybody.

37:59.316 --> 38:00.718
How... How terrible.

38:01.284 --> 38:05.453
Nighty-night, guys.
Out. Out. Bye-bye.

38:05.455 --> 38:08.660
Out! Bye-bye.

38:13.430 --> 38:16.335
Wow. That's a whole new breed
of crazy.

38:17.603 --> 38:19.239
Shut up, Shane.

38:21.106 --> 38:24.007
I'm... I'm so sorry
about your camera.

38:24.009 --> 38:25.976
It's all right, man,
it's the school's.

38:25.978 --> 38:27.246
They insure it.

38:27.747 --> 38:30.147
Man, I told you the wording
on that invitation

38:30.149 --> 38:31.417
was deceiving.

38:34.754 --> 38:37.622
He must be
a really unhappy person.

38:37.624 --> 38:40.594
I heard he could be kind of
an a-hole but that was nuts.

38:42.329 --> 38:45.331
I guess artists
are just emotional creatures.

38:45.333 --> 38:47.099
Tortured souls.

38:47.101 --> 38:49.467
But, I mean, what's there
even to be unhappy about?

38:49.469 --> 38:51.536
He's Vic Edwards,
for Christ's sake.

38:51.538 --> 38:54.009
He's made love
to so many beautiful women.

40:13.760 --> 40:15.029
Hmm.

40:17.799 --> 40:19.702
<i>Get over here, Vic.</i>

40:21.203 --> 40:22.538
Huh?

40:27.976 --> 40:29.309
Hello.

40:29.311 --> 40:31.378
<i>You just gonna stand there,
Vic?</i>

40:31.380 --> 40:33.548
<i>Just gonna stand there, Vic?</i>

40:33.550 --> 40:35.252
<i>Get over here, Vic.</i>

40:38.387 --> 40:39.890
<i>I love you, Vic.</i>

40:42.626 --> 40:44.560
<i>Get over here, Vic.</i>

40:44.562 --> 40:46.761
<i>You just gonna stand there,
Vic?</i>

40:46.763 --> 40:47.899
<i>Get over here, Vic.</i>

41:15.629 --> 41:16.627
Hello?

41:16.629 --> 41:18.697
<i>Please tell me you're with Vic.</i>

41:18.699 --> 41:20.632
- Who?
- <i>Dammit, Lil.</i>

41:20.634 --> 41:22.833
<i>Are you still asleep?
I can't believe you.</i>

41:22.835 --> 41:24.969
Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit.

41:24.971 --> 41:26.938
<i>You were supposed
to pick Vic up at the motel</i>

41:26.940 --> 41:28.006
<i>10 minutes ago.</i>

41:28.008 --> 41:29.541
Yeah, well, that's funny

41:29.543 --> 41:31.510
because I am almost
at the motel.

41:31.512 --> 41:32.945
<i>Beep your horn.</i>

41:32.947 --> 41:34.646
- Hmm?
- <i>Prove to me that you're</i>

41:34.648 --> 41:36.148
<i>in your car. Honk your horn.</i>

41:36.150 --> 41:37.682
Oh, shut up, Doug.

41:37.684 --> 41:39.054
I'll be there in, like,
15 minutes.

41:44.493 --> 41:47.560
- Mmm.
- Cut it out, Bjorn.

41:47.562 --> 41:48.795
I have to get to work.

41:48.797 --> 41:50.830
- You have to get to work?
- Yes, I do.

41:50.832 --> 41:53.203
What is that?
Driving some old man around?

41:54.570 --> 41:56.070
Can he not wait 15 minutes?

41:56.072 --> 41:58.005
Quit looking
so pleased with yourself.

41:58.007 --> 41:59.573
I'm still pissed at you.

41:59.575 --> 42:01.543
You got a funny way
of showing it.

42:01.545 --> 42:03.410
You didn't seem
too pissed at me

42:03.412 --> 42:04.680
a couple of hours ago.

42:04.682 --> 42:06.551
Okay, it's called a hate bone.

42:07.517 --> 42:09.587
You know you're cute
when you're angry.

42:12.823 --> 42:15.691
No, no. Don't do it.

42:15.693 --> 42:17.561
Oh, it's Doug again.

42:17.563 --> 42:19.563
Babe, babe, I really gotta go.

42:19.565 --> 42:22.235
I gotta go. Okay? Okay.

42:27.573 --> 42:30.707
Lock up when you leave,
all right?

42:30.709 --> 42:32.044
Done.

42:32.946 --> 42:34.078
Jerk.

42:34.080 --> 42:35.582
Bye.

42:45.726 --> 42:49.027
Yes? Oh. Only 25 minutes late.

42:49.029 --> 42:50.429
Come on.
Let's get to the restaurant.

42:50.431 --> 42:51.731
The boys are all waiting.

42:51.733 --> 42:52.868
Really?

42:53.635 --> 42:54.934
What happened to your head?

42:54.936 --> 42:56.472
Eh...

42:59.975 --> 43:02.040
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's this?

43:02.042 --> 43:03.643
You're gonna take me
to the airport

43:03.645 --> 43:05.047
and I'm going back to LA.

43:05.748 --> 43:08.047
But what about Doug
and the film festival?

43:08.049 --> 43:09.482
Uh, what about them?

43:09.484 --> 43:12.953
In the grand tradition
of Nicholson and Eastwood,

43:12.955 --> 43:15.923
I will accept
my Lifetime Achievement Award

43:15.925 --> 43:17.961
in absentia.

43:19.563 --> 43:21.262
Suit yourself.

43:34.478 --> 43:36.080
So how's Bjorn?

43:36.948 --> 43:38.482
Wouldn't know.

43:40.853 --> 43:42.352
I see.

43:42.354 --> 43:44.921
I suppose you just
gave yourself that hickey

43:44.923 --> 43:46.258
on your neck then.

43:49.961 --> 43:51.197
That was there before.

43:51.797 --> 43:53.633
No, it wasn't.

43:54.701 --> 43:57.301
You're a pretty nosy old guy,
aren't you?

43:57.303 --> 43:59.103
I don't know
if nosy is the word.

43:59.105 --> 44:00.303
When you get to be my age,

44:00.305 --> 44:02.507
there are clear cut
delineations

44:02.509 --> 44:06.014
between what is acceptable
and what is unacceptable.

44:06.880 --> 44:10.115
What he did was unacceptable.

44:10.117 --> 44:11.650
Oh, I get it.

44:11.652 --> 44:14.720
So I guess your behavior
last night was acceptable.

44:14.722 --> 44:17.790
I mean, to be honest with you,
you're being pretty shitty.

44:17.792 --> 44:20.560
I could give two shits about
Doug's little film festival.

44:20.562 --> 44:23.730
But you are being very uncool.

44:23.732 --> 44:25.801
Well, that's life.

44:27.469 --> 44:28.969
He'll get over it.

44:28.971 --> 44:30.637
Are you always
this much of an asshole

44:30.639 --> 44:32.840
or just to lowly peons
like us?

44:32.842 --> 44:36.242
No. I'm pretty much
always a big asshole.

44:36.244 --> 44:39.179
Wow, cool. Must be so
liberating to live your life

44:39.181 --> 44:41.385
not giving a shit about
anybody but yourself.

44:44.088 --> 44:46.591
Take the next exit, all right?

44:47.691 --> 44:49.727
Why? The airport's ahead.

44:50.227 --> 44:53.695
I can see that,
but take the next exit.

44:53.697 --> 44:55.565
To Knoxville?
It's a three hour drive.

44:55.567 --> 44:57.032
What time's your plane?

44:57.034 --> 44:58.867
I'll reschedule it.

44:58.869 --> 45:01.237
Okay. I can't just
up and go to Knoxville.

45:01.239 --> 45:02.739
I got things I gotta do.

45:02.741 --> 45:04.177
Bjorn can wait.

45:05.077 --> 45:07.778
I was promised
an assistant and a car

45:07.780 --> 45:08.948
for the whole weekend.

45:09.715 --> 45:11.550
There are things
I gotta take care of.

45:13.251 --> 45:15.020
Now, go.

45:26.966 --> 45:29.235
Don't you think we ought to
slow down a little?

45:29.237 --> 45:31.771
We're liable to get
pulled over.

45:31.773 --> 45:33.208
Cute.

45:36.610 --> 45:38.246
Goddamn son-of-a-bitch.

45:41.984 --> 45:43.283
Goddamn, it's a Texas Mountie.

45:43.285 --> 45:44.784
What the hell's he doing
in Arkansas?

45:44.786 --> 45:47.319
I think you better pull off
to the side, Vic.

45:47.321 --> 45:49.758
Well, let's just see
what he's got under the hood.

45:50.558 --> 45:51.828
Bye, bye, baby.

45:55.231 --> 45:56.430
Vic, take it easy.

45:56.432 --> 45:58.402
I may be old
but I'm not ready to die yet.

46:09.245 --> 46:10.946
What the hell's
the matter with you?

46:10.948 --> 46:12.948
We could have been killed.

46:12.950 --> 46:15.116
You think you're gonna
live forever?

46:15.118 --> 46:16.251
Uh-huh.

46:16.253 --> 46:18.121
Look, I know you think

46:18.123 --> 46:19.588
you've got it
all figured out right now.

46:19.590 --> 46:21.023
Well, I do some crazy things.

46:21.025 --> 46:23.927
Well, listen to me.
You're on a collision course.

46:23.929 --> 46:27.263
You're about to make
a lot of bad life decisions.

46:27.265 --> 46:28.933
Really?

46:28.935 --> 46:30.868
I can help you
before you throw it all away.

46:30.870 --> 46:31.972
Too late now!

46:34.841 --> 46:37.377
No!

46:38.376 --> 46:40.679
My current doctor
is better than most.

46:40.681 --> 46:43.681
I still get the freakouts
and the crying belts

46:43.683 --> 46:46.717
for hours and hours
on end every once in a while.

46:46.719 --> 46:50.957
But I stopped having seizures
and I stopped cutting myself.

46:52.360 --> 46:53.829
Wow.

46:55.296 --> 46:57.166
Now I'm really depressed.

46:58.700 --> 47:00.466
It was really bad for a while.

47:00.468 --> 47:01.700
I was convinced
the only way out

47:01.702 --> 47:02.838
was to kill myself.

47:03.339 --> 47:05.538
Kill yourself? Are you crazy?

47:05.540 --> 47:07.643
Yes.
Haven't you been listening?

47:08.543 --> 47:10.509
Killing yourself
is the most selfish thing

47:10.511 --> 47:12.045
a person can do.

47:12.047 --> 47:14.248
Well, I didn't do it, did I?

47:14.250 --> 47:15.820
Well, don't.

47:16.987 --> 47:18.856
You know what's depressing?

47:19.722 --> 47:22.659
Growing old.
That's depressing.

47:23.159 --> 47:24.425
You know what your problem is?

47:24.427 --> 47:25.727
What?

47:25.729 --> 47:28.429
You need to lighten up and
appreciate what you've got.

47:28.431 --> 47:33.335
'Cause pretty soon, bang,
it passes you right by.

47:33.337 --> 47:36.371
- Oh, it's just that easy?
- Right.

47:36.373 --> 47:38.873
That is so ignorant.

47:38.875 --> 47:42.711
I'm not depressed.
I have depression.

47:42.713 --> 47:44.014
It's different.

47:44.016 --> 47:47.450
Having depression
is having a mental illness.

47:47.452 --> 47:50.019
- It has to be medicated.
- Bullshit.

47:50.021 --> 47:51.924
You gotta be a fighter.

47:52.392 --> 47:53.524
Things get you down,

47:53.526 --> 47:55.759
you pick yourself up
by your bootstraps

47:55.761 --> 47:58.062
and you just trudge forward.

47:58.064 --> 47:59.196
You're one to talk.

47:59.198 --> 48:01.100
I see you popping pills
all the time.

48:01.968 --> 48:05.039
That's because I'm in pain.

48:06.039 --> 48:08.108
Well, so am I.

48:08.574 --> 48:10.474
What do you take for it?

48:12.813 --> 48:14.412
Well, I was on Abilify,

48:14.414 --> 48:16.816
which is a mood stabilizer
for bipolar disorder,

48:16.818 --> 48:18.084
but it felt like fireworks
were going off

48:18.086 --> 48:20.787
in my brain 24/7,
so I tried Trileptal.

48:20.789 --> 48:22.955
But that caused me to sleep
for two solid weeks.

48:22.957 --> 48:24.957
And I was taking that
with Lexapro,

48:24.959 --> 48:26.058
which is an antidepressant,

48:26.060 --> 48:27.293
but that turns you
into a fat zombie.

48:27.295 --> 48:29.396
And then I tried Zoloft,
which kills your sex drive,

48:29.398 --> 48:30.764
and that's just not
gonna work.

48:30.766 --> 48:31.965
Klonopin is an anti-anxiety,

48:31.967 --> 48:34.101
but that put me to sleep
for 10 hours, too.

48:34.103 --> 48:35.835
And Lamictal,
which is similar to Lithium,

48:35.837 --> 48:37.603
gave me a bad rash
all over my body,

48:37.605 --> 48:38.806
which was so not cute.

48:38.808 --> 48:40.575
Then they put me on Seroquel,
an antipsychotic,

48:40.577 --> 48:43.010
which also put me into
a deep sleep for hours on end.

48:43.012 --> 48:45.013
So they put me on Provigil,
which is a stimulant

48:45.015 --> 48:47.147
that kept me up and focused,
which is good.

48:47.149 --> 48:48.950
In fact, I had to try
several stimulants

48:48.952 --> 48:50.651
before settling on Provigil.

48:50.653 --> 48:51.953
Adderall, Vyvanse,

48:51.955 --> 48:53.989
but those all make you
act like a coke addict.

48:53.991 --> 48:56.192
The Suboxone gave me
scary hallucinations

48:56.194 --> 48:58.460
and caused me to throw up
all over the house,

48:58.462 --> 49:00.529
which, like I said before,
is super cute.

49:00.531 --> 49:01.864
I'm currently
on a cocktail of Provigil,

49:01.866 --> 49:04.001
Ativan, which is for anxiety,

49:04.003 --> 49:05.602
Prozac for my depression,
which helps clear the fog

49:05.604 --> 49:07.370
from my brain a little bit.

49:07.372 --> 49:09.772
And an Enzyme patch,
which is an MAO inhibitor.

49:09.774 --> 49:12.541
I mean, it helps but I can't
eat chocolate when I'm on it,

49:12.543 --> 49:14.513
which is depressing
unto itself.

49:20.152 --> 49:21.321
Can I help you?

49:22.489 --> 49:24.158
Should you be driving?

50:25.623 --> 50:27.794
And we're here because...

50:29.028 --> 50:31.865
Because that's
where I grew up.

50:34.399 --> 50:37.100
We drove three hours
just so you could come

50:37.102 --> 50:38.969
and see your old house?

50:38.971 --> 50:40.073
Yeah.

50:41.040 --> 50:43.076
You got a problem with that?

50:44.710 --> 50:46.212
You are so corny.

50:46.580 --> 50:49.917
Yeah, that's true.
Very true. Huh.

50:51.452 --> 50:53.251
Whatever.

50:53.253 --> 50:55.653
I feel like
I'm in a time machine.

50:55.655 --> 50:57.458
Everything looks the same.

50:58.258 --> 51:00.126
Smells the same.

51:00.128 --> 51:03.132
- Like dogshit.
- Exactly.

51:03.665 --> 51:06.900
I swear my mother's gonna
walk out that door

51:06.902 --> 51:08.235
and she's gonna say,

51:08.237 --> 51:11.571
"Marty, get your tuckus
inside for dinner."

51:11.573 --> 51:13.105
Marty?

51:13.107 --> 51:15.309
Martin Schulman.

51:15.311 --> 51:16.977
Nice to meet you.

51:16.979 --> 51:19.347
Hold on. Your real name's
Marty Schulman?

51:19.349 --> 51:20.747
Are you kidding me?

51:20.749 --> 51:23.351
Nobody from my day
kept their Jewish name

51:23.353 --> 51:25.253
if they wanted
a career in Hollywood.

51:25.255 --> 51:28.123
Tony Curtis' real name is
Bernie Schwartz.

51:28.125 --> 51:29.627
Who's Tony Curtis?

51:30.426 --> 51:31.829
Never mind.

51:34.430 --> 51:35.964
Can I help you two?

51:35.966 --> 51:38.934
Yes, ma'am. I know you think
we're some crazy people

51:38.936 --> 51:41.271
standing out here
staring at your house but...

51:41.273 --> 51:43.173
Are you Jehovah's Witnesses?

51:43.175 --> 51:45.208
No, ma'am.

51:45.210 --> 51:47.776
I actually used to
live in this house.

51:47.778 --> 51:49.345
I happened to be in the area

51:49.347 --> 51:51.948
and I wanted to take a little
walk down memory lane.

51:51.950 --> 51:53.450
Oh.

51:53.452 --> 51:54.951
Must have been a long time ago

51:54.953 --> 51:57.154
because we've been here
over 40 years now.

51:57.156 --> 51:59.055
That's a long time.

51:59.057 --> 52:02.728
Well, this house
has been pretty good to us.

52:03.396 --> 52:06.733
We raised many a child
and grandchild ourselves here.

52:07.400 --> 52:11.001
You know, they say that, um,
old actor, Vic Edwards,

52:11.003 --> 52:14.371
actually grew up in this
house here, too.

52:14.373 --> 52:16.008
No kidding.

52:16.010 --> 52:19.147
Ma'am, this is Vic Edwards.

52:28.056 --> 52:31.592
Oh, I be damned!

52:31.594 --> 52:33.326
You know
how many times

52:33.328 --> 52:35.262
I told people you grew up
in this house?

52:35.264 --> 52:36.563
I didn't even know
whether it was true or not.

52:36.565 --> 52:39.600
And here you are.
My God, here you are.

52:39.602 --> 52:41.501
Can I hug you?
Can I hug you?

52:41.503 --> 52:43.771
- Well, please, I'd love it.
- Oh, my goodness.

52:43.773 --> 52:47.108
Oh!
I can't believe this.

52:47.110 --> 52:50.848
Here you are. The Vic Edwards.

52:51.114 --> 52:52.715
Oh, memories.

52:52.717 --> 52:55.250
I can't believe this.

52:55.252 --> 52:57.052
Do you know what?
My brother and I

52:57.054 --> 52:59.688
used to come tearing down
these stairs,

52:59.690 --> 53:00.855
three steps at a time.

53:00.857 --> 53:03.260
I don't know why
we were in such a hurry

53:03.262 --> 53:06.463
but we were racing like it was
the last thing we ever did.

54:00.456 --> 54:02.322
<i>Where are you guys?</i>

54:02.324 --> 54:04.292
<i>I mean, when are you
going to be home?</i>

54:04.294 --> 54:06.428
I have no idea
when I'm gonna be home.

54:06.430 --> 54:07.761
<i>What are you guys doing?</i>

54:07.763 --> 54:08.997
He's on some, like,

54:08.999 --> 54:11.499
weird memory tour
or something. Ugh.

54:11.501 --> 54:13.435
Anyway, he's making me
drive him around

54:13.437 --> 54:14.770
to all these places
from his past.

54:14.772 --> 54:16.338
He's on some, like,
nostalgia kick.

54:16.340 --> 54:19.342
It's so not fair
that she gets to do that.

54:19.344 --> 54:20.476
First, we went to this

54:20.478 --> 54:22.811
old little house
where he grew up

54:22.813 --> 54:25.780
<i>and then we went to the temple
where he had his Bar Mitzvah.</i>

54:25.782 --> 54:26.982
Did you guys know
he was Jewish?

54:26.984 --> 54:28.118
Yes.

54:28.120 --> 54:29.355
<i>Of course
you knew he was Jewish.</i>

54:40.033 --> 54:41.565
<i>Then we went
to the old pool hall</i>

54:41.567 --> 54:42.799
<i>he used to hang out in,</i>

54:42.801 --> 54:44.369
<i>which is now a cupcake shop,</i>

54:44.371 --> 54:47.371
which he ranted about forever.
And then I said,

54:47.373 --> 54:50.141
<i>"Hey, gourmet cupcakes
are super-trendy now."</i>

54:50.143 --> 54:51.477
<i>Didn't care.</i>

54:51.479 --> 54:52.845
And then he had to have

54:52.847 --> 54:54.646
a GooGoo Cluster.
I don't know what it is.

54:54.648 --> 54:56.414
<i>Maybe they just don't have
GooGoo Clusters</i>

54:56.416 --> 54:57.515
<i>in LA or something.</i>

54:57.517 --> 54:58.753
- <i>I don't know.</i>
- Mmm. Mmm.

54:59.019 --> 55:00.718
<i>Now we're at
Neyland Stadium</i>

55:00.720 --> 55:03.656
and he's just standing there,
staring at the building,

55:03.658 --> 55:05.257
like a mental patient.

55:05.259 --> 55:06.592
<i>They're at Neyland Stadium.</i>

55:06.594 --> 55:08.161
<i>That's ridiculous.</i>

55:08.163 --> 55:09.429
He was the starting
tailback for UT

55:09.431 --> 55:11.531
during the 1951
undefeated season.

55:11.533 --> 55:13.600
Anyways, after this,
he wants to go

55:13.602 --> 55:15.735
to some old folks hospital

55:15.737 --> 55:17.838
to see his first wife
or something.

55:17.840 --> 55:19.606
And then we should be
on our way back.

55:19.608 --> 55:21.541
<i>This is honestly
all your fault.</i>

55:21.543 --> 55:23.379
My fault? How's it my fault?

55:23.845 --> 55:25.845
Because you told him
I was his 24/7 driving slave

55:25.847 --> 55:27.181
for the entire weekend.

55:27.183 --> 55:28.582
Okay, whatever.
Just take lots of pictures

55:28.584 --> 55:29.618
and Instagram them.

55:29.620 --> 55:31.953
- <i>Oh, and hashtag the festival.</i>
- Yeah, right.

55:31.955 --> 55:34.256
- Tell her I said hi.
- <i>Yeah, Shane...</i>

55:34.258 --> 55:36.393
I can hear you.
I'm back with Bjorn.

55:36.926 --> 55:39.695
Anyways, gotta go.
See you when I see you.

55:43.867 --> 55:45.467
<i>Yo.</i>

55:45.469 --> 55:47.603
<i>You leave it.
I'll retrieve it.</i>

55:47.605 --> 55:50.273
Bjorn. Hey, it's me.

55:50.275 --> 55:53.576
Again. Where the hell are you?
I keep calling you.

55:53.578 --> 55:57.281
Anyway, I am still stuck in
Knoxville with this old guy.

55:57.283 --> 55:58.649
I think probably
another hour here

55:58.651 --> 56:01.218
and then it's
a three-hour drive home.

56:01.220 --> 56:02.790
And then I get to see you.

56:04.224 --> 56:06.559
Oh, crap, he's on the move.

56:07.893 --> 56:10.598
I miss you. Bye.

56:28.449 --> 56:30.317
Shit.

56:30.319 --> 56:32.087
It's my buddy.

56:33.589 --> 56:34.857
Mmm.

56:37.592 --> 56:40.327
All right, well,
it appears to be locked,

56:40.329 --> 56:42.497
so we can reminisce
on the way back.

56:42.499 --> 56:46.669
Sucks but we have
a really long drive home.

56:48.671 --> 56:50.772
What? What? Whoa.
What are you doing?

56:50.774 --> 56:53.444
Vic, we can't go on the field.
That's totally not allowed.

56:54.011 --> 56:56.514
Come with me.

57:01.185 --> 57:03.622
I love the smell of cut grass.

57:05.657 --> 57:07.459
Mmm.

57:10.461 --> 57:16.132
1951. I was a sophomore
but I started three games.

57:16.134 --> 57:18.701
Full disclosure,
I mean, I really

57:18.703 --> 57:20.571
don't know that much
about football.

57:20.573 --> 57:22.205
I mean... Anything, actually.

57:22.207 --> 57:23.973
But, to be honest,
I really don't give a shit

57:23.975 --> 57:25.509
about football.

57:25.511 --> 57:27.211
Well, that's your loss.

57:27.213 --> 57:28.682
Sorry.

57:29.016 --> 57:34.586
We were undefeated, going into
the last game against Texas.

57:34.588 --> 57:37.421
They were ahead by two points.

57:39.327 --> 57:41.560
We got down
on the four yard line.

57:41.562 --> 57:44.763
I wanted the ball.

57:44.765 --> 57:48.234
I went up and over
and I scored.

57:48.236 --> 57:51.541
And then I heard
this horrible racket.

57:52.675 --> 57:55.678
The whole damn Texas team
landed on me.

57:57.746 --> 57:59.349
When they pulled them off,

57:59.882 --> 58:02.887
my knee was a mess.

58:05.555 --> 58:07.258
I could never play again.

58:08.691 --> 58:10.126
That sucks.

58:10.693 --> 58:12.729
Yeah, it did.

58:15.098 --> 58:17.368
Well, it's fun
being a movie star,

58:18.134 --> 58:21.639
but nothing compares
to being a football star.

58:23.741 --> 58:24.940
Nothing.

58:42.161 --> 58:44.561
<i>He's in! He's in!</i>

58:44.563 --> 58:45.933
<i>Touchdown...</i>

59:05.120 --> 59:06.255
You know something?

59:07.355 --> 59:09.625
This is the exact spot

59:11.993 --> 59:14.798
where I proposed
to my first wife.

59:18.800 --> 59:20.269
Great.

59:23.139 --> 59:25.441
And then
everything went wrong.

59:26.108 --> 59:29.343
I had this little ring box,
you know.

59:29.345 --> 59:31.648
And I was so excited
when I opened it.

59:32.381 --> 59:35.549
The ring
went flying out,

59:35.551 --> 59:37.387
right into the water.

59:38.722 --> 59:42.824
And naturally,
I jumped in after it.

59:42.826 --> 59:44.860
I never found it.

59:44.862 --> 59:48.130
So I got a piece of seaweed

59:48.132 --> 59:50.032
and I made a ring out of it.

59:50.034 --> 59:52.972
Got down on one knee
and put it on her finger.

59:55.540 --> 59:57.243
And she just thought
that was great.

59:58.743 --> 59:59.812
Anyhow,

01:00:01.245 --> 01:00:03.581
she still said yes,
and then we heard music

01:00:03.583 --> 01:00:04.818
coming from the dock.

01:00:05.552 --> 01:00:07.221
We danced right here.

01:00:08.587 --> 01:00:10.223
And then, well,

01:00:12.592 --> 01:00:15.263
we always talked about
we'd come back here some day.

01:00:17.497 --> 01:00:18.832
But we never did.

01:00:47.063 --> 01:00:49.229
Why are we just sitting here?
I mean, let's go in.

01:00:49.231 --> 01:00:51.366
It's still
a three-hour drive back.

01:00:51.368 --> 01:00:53.534
Just wait a second, okay?

01:00:53.536 --> 01:00:55.038
It's not that easy.

01:00:56.473 --> 01:00:58.940
It's been a long time.

01:00:58.942 --> 01:01:00.107
What are you so scared of?

01:01:00.109 --> 01:01:02.878
So she's gonna look old.
You look old, too.

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:04.646
I beg your pardon.

01:01:04.648 --> 01:01:07.249
Okay, not that you don't
look good for your age.

01:01:07.251 --> 01:01:08.487
Oh.

01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:10.789
So what's her name, anyhow?

01:01:11.722 --> 01:01:12.925
Claudia.

01:01:15.426 --> 01:01:16.759
Was she pretty?

01:01:16.761 --> 01:01:19.064
She was the prettiest
of them all.

01:01:20.732 --> 01:01:22.332
We were just kids.

01:01:22.334 --> 01:01:24.634
We had no business
getting married.

01:01:24.636 --> 01:01:26.406
I didn't know
what the hell I was doing.

01:01:27.273 --> 01:01:29.240
If Claudia's number one,

01:01:29.242 --> 01:01:31.345
how many times
were you married altogether?

01:01:33.346 --> 01:01:34.778
Five.

01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:36.581
- Five?
- Mmm.

01:01:36.583 --> 01:01:39.819
Wow.
That's a lot of alimony.

01:01:39.821 --> 01:01:41.187
You're telling me.

01:01:41.189 --> 01:01:43.154
A buddy of mine told me once,

01:01:43.156 --> 01:01:45.991
never, ever get married.

01:01:45.993 --> 01:01:47.959
Just skip the middle man,

01:01:47.961 --> 01:01:51.197
find a woman you hate,
and buy her a house.

01:01:51.199 --> 01:01:52.298
But you're rich right, right?

01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:53.833
I mean, aren't all
famous people rich?

01:01:53.835 --> 01:01:55.668
Ha.

01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:57.838
Just 'cause somebody's famous,

01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:59.509
that doesn't mean
they're rich.

01:02:00.375 --> 01:02:02.810
Didn't you have any kids who
could help take care of you?

01:02:02.812 --> 01:02:04.615
One, with Claudia.

01:02:05.615 --> 01:02:06.981
Grace.

01:02:06.983 --> 01:02:09.316
- Grace?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:02:09.318 --> 01:02:10.651
That's a pretty name.

01:02:10.653 --> 01:02:12.953
I mean, geez, if you guys were
kids when you got married,

01:02:12.955 --> 01:02:16.027
she must be, what?
Fifty, sixty years old now.

01:02:18.529 --> 01:02:19.998
She's dead.

01:02:22.199 --> 01:02:24.335
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah.

01:02:25.636 --> 01:02:27.006
I'm sorry.

01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:32.041
Should I just not ask
any questions about her?

01:02:32.043 --> 01:02:34.012
It's best not to,
if you don't mind.

01:02:50.530 --> 01:02:52.999
Aw, shit.

01:02:58.938 --> 01:03:00.774
There she comes.

01:03:03.111 --> 01:03:04.944
- May I help you?
- Yes.

01:03:04.946 --> 01:03:07.850
I would like to see
Claudia Schulman, please.

01:03:08.850 --> 01:03:12.884
I'm sorry, but visiting hours
ended at 7:00 p.m.

01:03:12.886 --> 01:03:17.023
Yeah, well, I came from
Los Angeles to get here, okay?

01:03:17.025 --> 01:03:18.092
So let us in.

01:03:18.094 --> 01:03:20.693
We'll just be in here for
five minutes. All right?

01:03:20.695 --> 01:03:23.963
I'm sorry, but you'll have
to come back tomorrow.

01:03:23.965 --> 01:03:26.533
Visiting hours
begin at 8:00 a.m.

01:03:26.535 --> 01:03:28.303
You can have
breakfast with her.

01:03:28.305 --> 01:03:29.803
- No kidding.
- Yeah.

01:03:29.805 --> 01:03:32.040
Could you lean closer?
I can't hear you.

01:03:32.042 --> 01:03:32.975
Hey!

01:03:32.977 --> 01:03:34.942
I'm gonna put this
right into your nose.

01:03:34.944 --> 01:03:37.745
No. No, you're not. All right,
well, thank you, ma'am.

01:03:37.747 --> 01:03:38.981
We totally understand.

01:03:38.983 --> 01:03:40.916
Thank you. We will
come back a different day.

01:03:40.918 --> 01:03:42.418
I don't know who she is.

01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:43.719
Yeah, all right, yeah.

01:03:43.721 --> 01:03:45.153
Thank you. Thank you.

01:03:45.155 --> 01:03:47.489
- Holy shit.
- Thanks. All right. Let's go.

01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:48.791
Vic, are you kidding?

01:03:48.793 --> 01:03:50.159
What the hell's
the matter with you?

01:03:50.161 --> 01:03:52.962
What the hell's the matter
with you, Vic? It's closed.

01:03:52.964 --> 01:03:54.830
She wasn't going
to let us in anyways.

01:03:54.832 --> 01:03:57.133
And if you kept doing that,
she was gonna call the cops.

01:03:57.135 --> 01:03:58.638
You want to end up on TMZ?

01:03:59.104 --> 01:04:00.803
- TM what?
- TMZ.

01:04:00.805 --> 01:04:02.442
- What is that?
- Shut up. I...

01:04:03.676 --> 01:04:07.311
Oh, bullshit. You just want to
get back to your douche-bag.

01:04:07.313 --> 01:04:09.447
Bjorn has nothing
to do with this.

01:04:09.449 --> 01:04:11.081
Oh, really?

01:04:11.083 --> 01:04:13.817
That's why you keep
calling him every 15 minutes.

01:04:13.819 --> 01:04:15.019
Will you leave the guy alone?

01:04:15.021 --> 01:04:16.821
Oh, so now you're on his side?

01:04:16.823 --> 01:04:18.957
You know whose side I'm on?

01:04:18.959 --> 01:04:20.158
Mine.

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:22.760
I'm not leaving here
until I see Claudia.

01:04:22.762 --> 01:04:25.530
Tell douche-bag you'll
have to see him tomorrow

01:04:25.532 --> 01:04:27.333
'cause we're spending
the night in Knoxville.

01:04:27.335 --> 01:04:28.768
Wait, what?

01:04:28.770 --> 01:04:30.969
Maybe you're spending
the night in Knoxville,

01:04:30.971 --> 01:04:32.605
but I'm driving back
to Nashville.

01:04:32.607 --> 01:04:34.206
You know
you're a pain in the ass.

01:04:34.208 --> 01:04:35.810
Yeah, well, so are you.

01:04:36.111 --> 01:04:37.513
Bye.

01:04:38.313 --> 01:04:40.680
What are you doing?
Where are you gonna go?

01:04:40.682 --> 01:04:42.383
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

01:04:42.385 --> 01:04:44.020
Just away from you.

01:05:06.476 --> 01:05:07.812
Get in the car.

01:05:09.012 --> 01:05:10.246
Why?

01:05:10.248 --> 01:05:11.146
'Cause I'm gonna
stay the night

01:05:11.148 --> 01:05:12.847
with you in Knoxville.

01:05:12.849 --> 01:05:15.085
I don't want to be
responsible if, God forbid,

01:05:15.087 --> 01:05:16.919
something bad happens to you.

01:05:16.921 --> 01:05:19.157
Never hear the end of it
from my brother.

01:05:19.825 --> 01:05:22.028
Besides, I think I saw
a Motel 6 back there.

01:05:23.662 --> 01:05:26.532
We ain't staying at a Motel 6.

01:05:36.208 --> 01:05:38.077
Can you afford
for us to stay here?

01:05:38.079 --> 01:05:41.080
No, but that's the beauty
of credit cards.

01:05:41.082 --> 01:05:42.580
Still gotta pay it off
at some point.

01:05:42.582 --> 01:05:43.714
Let's live it up.

01:05:43.716 --> 01:05:45.249
I'm tired of feeling
like a has-been.

01:05:48.055 --> 01:05:51.023
Welcome to the Knoxville
Grand Hotel. Checking in?

01:05:51.025 --> 01:05:52.192
Yes, we are.

01:05:52.194 --> 01:05:53.726
And the name
on the reservation?

01:05:53.728 --> 01:05:55.231
Vic Edwards.

01:05:58.199 --> 01:06:00.900
I'm sorry, Mr. Edwards,
but for some reason,

01:06:00.902 --> 01:06:03.269
I don't see your reservation
in our system.

01:06:03.271 --> 01:06:06.709
Really? My assistant here
made it weeks ago.

01:06:08.577 --> 01:06:10.410
- Oh, uh, yeah.
- Yeah.

01:06:10.412 --> 01:06:13.414
I made that reservation
weeks ago.

01:06:13.416 --> 01:06:16.585
- No harm. One room, two beds.
- One room?

01:06:16.587 --> 01:06:18.119
Yeah. One room, two beds.

01:06:18.121 --> 01:06:20.221
Yeah, well,
I made the reservation

01:06:20.223 --> 01:06:22.056
for two rooms.
So, two rooms.

01:06:22.058 --> 01:06:24.391
How much for two rooms?

01:06:24.393 --> 01:06:26.329
Our rooms rates start at $650.

01:06:26.331 --> 01:06:27.597
Oh, okay, fine.

01:06:27.599 --> 01:06:30.066
- Well, then, uh, one room.
- Okay.

01:06:30.068 --> 01:06:31.300
But unfortunately,
Mr. Edwards,

01:06:31.302 --> 01:06:33.401
we are fully committed
at this time.

01:06:33.403 --> 01:06:35.972
Interesting. When they say
they're fully committed,

01:06:35.974 --> 01:06:38.074
it's always bullshit.

01:06:38.076 --> 01:06:39.275
Clint Eastwood walked in,

01:06:39.277 --> 01:06:41.178
you think
they'd turn him away.

01:06:41.180 --> 01:06:43.647
Hell, no.
Now, you find me a room.

01:06:43.649 --> 01:06:45.652
Please. And thank you.

01:06:46.752 --> 01:06:48.317
Perhaps I should get
my manager.

01:06:48.319 --> 01:06:50.523
- Perhaps you should.
- I'll be right back.

01:06:51.958 --> 01:06:53.358
Oh, what are you doing?

01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:55.626
You're gonna get us
kicked out of this hotel.

01:06:55.628 --> 01:06:58.162
Mr. Edwards, I'm terribly
sorry for this mix-up.

01:06:58.164 --> 01:07:00.365
I'm Gary, the Night Manager,
here at the Knoxville Grand.

01:07:00.367 --> 01:07:01.765
I don't know
how your reservation

01:07:01.767 --> 01:07:03.169
got lost in the shuffle,

01:07:03.171 --> 01:07:05.971
but we'd be happy to remedy
that situation right now.

01:07:05.973 --> 01:07:07.640
Oh, thank you, Gary.

01:07:07.642 --> 01:07:09.274
All of our rooms
are fully booked.

01:07:09.276 --> 01:07:12.277
However, we do have
the penthouse suite available.

01:07:12.279 --> 01:07:14.613
I would be happy to give you
that room tonight

01:07:14.615 --> 01:07:15.981
for the cost
of the standard room.

01:07:15.983 --> 01:07:18.385
That's very nice.
Thanks, Gary.

01:07:18.387 --> 01:07:20.287
Let me
get that key for you.

01:07:20.289 --> 01:07:22.889
Welcome back to the
Knoxville Grand, Mr. Edwards.

01:07:22.891 --> 01:07:24.224
God bless you. Thank you.

01:07:24.226 --> 01:07:25.291
Thank you, Gary.

01:07:25.293 --> 01:07:27.461
- You're welcome.
- All right. Let's go, Vic.

01:07:27.463 --> 01:07:29.863
- You ready, kid?
- Oh, I'm ready.

01:07:29.865 --> 01:07:32.232
All right, Mr. Edwards.

01:07:32.234 --> 01:07:33.803
He didn't have a reservation.

01:07:34.736 --> 01:07:36.303
Oh, I know.

01:07:36.305 --> 01:07:37.872
Then what's with
the ass-kissing routine?

01:07:37.874 --> 01:07:39.474
Who's Vic Edwards?

01:07:41.212 --> 01:07:42.547
He's a living legend.

01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:52.020
Oh, my God.

01:07:53.158 --> 01:07:55.390
This thing is bigger
than the house I grew up in.

01:07:55.392 --> 01:07:59.028
- Yeah. You like?
- Ah! Do I like it?

01:07:59.030 --> 01:08:00.232
Mmm-hmm.

01:08:00.664 --> 01:08:01.998
Oh, my God,
and this bathtub

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.333
is even bigger than my car.

01:08:03.335 --> 01:08:05.069
Oh, well. That's big, I guess.

01:08:06.239 --> 01:08:08.072
Oh, my God.
They have a bidet.

01:08:08.074 --> 01:08:10.340
I thought they only had
that crap in, like Tokyo.

01:08:10.342 --> 01:08:11.442
What?

01:08:11.444 --> 01:08:12.875
I just figured out
what that was

01:08:12.877 --> 01:08:15.946
'cause at first, I thought,
it was just a guys' bathroom.

01:08:15.948 --> 01:08:18.283
I can't believe
these bedrooms. God.

01:08:18.285 --> 01:08:19.950
I call dibs on this room!

01:08:19.952 --> 01:08:21.618
I can't believe we're here.

01:08:21.621 --> 01:08:24.558
Oh, my God. I have to go
look at this closet.

01:08:26.728 --> 01:08:28.861
Oh, my God. Ha!

01:08:28.863 --> 01:08:30.060
I can't believe
you used to stay

01:08:30.063 --> 01:08:31.863
in these places all the time.

01:08:31.866 --> 01:08:33.566
Oh.

01:08:33.568 --> 01:08:35.368
Doug is going to freak out.

01:08:35.370 --> 01:08:37.435
We have to Instagram
the hell out of this.

01:08:57.426 --> 01:08:59.263
- Whoa.
- Oh!

01:09:08.406 --> 01:09:10.308
What the hell is that?

01:09:14.011 --> 01:09:17.479
That was amazing. I've never
had room service before.

01:09:17.482 --> 01:09:21.153
Oh, that's one of the perks
I miss the most.

01:09:21.585 --> 01:09:24.823
Fancy hotel rooms
and room service.

01:09:31.331 --> 01:09:33.300
- Vic the Dick.
- Yep.

01:09:34.466 --> 01:09:36.834
You're lucky
I'm in a good mood.

01:09:36.836 --> 01:09:39.270
This is you
in a good mood?

01:09:39.272 --> 01:09:40.975
I'd hate to see you
in a bad mood.

01:09:41.506 --> 01:09:43.341
What do you do with your art?

01:09:43.343 --> 01:09:47.379
Besides draw festival logos
and insult people.

01:09:47.381 --> 01:09:48.783
Nothing, really.

01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:51.484
Why don't you have a showing?

01:09:51.486 --> 01:09:53.019
Try and sell something.

01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:54.854
I can't just roll up
my sleeves

01:09:54.856 --> 01:09:56.521
and throw an art show.

01:09:56.523 --> 01:09:58.157
Use the bar.

01:09:58.159 --> 01:09:59.958
If it's good enough
for a film festival,

01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:01.627
it's good enough
for an art show.

01:10:01.629 --> 01:10:04.364
- I get embarrassed.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:10:04.366 --> 01:10:07.633
Doug loves to be the center
of attention. And I don't.

01:10:07.635 --> 01:10:09.002
Gives me anxiety.

01:10:09.004 --> 01:10:11.538
Nothing wrong with being
the center of attention.

01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:15.313
I'd rather be famous and broke
than be rich and nobody.

01:10:15.845 --> 01:10:17.978
Instead, I'm broke and nobody.

01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:20.749
That's the worst combination.

01:10:20.751 --> 01:10:22.750
Why can't you
just live in the present

01:10:22.752 --> 01:10:25.253
and stop looking
in the rearview mirror?

01:10:25.255 --> 01:10:28.758
All I ever hear from you is
"I was rich," "I was famous,"

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:32.827
I was this, I was that.
How about "You are"?

01:10:32.829 --> 01:10:34.330
It's easier said than done,

01:10:34.332 --> 01:10:36.698
especially when your brother's
little film festival

01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:40.403
shines such a spotlight
on where I was

01:10:40.405 --> 01:10:43.008
compared to how far
down I've come.

01:10:43.609 --> 01:10:46.379
It's not Doug's fault
that you're not happy.

01:10:46.911 --> 01:10:48.714
Okay, Dr. Freud.

01:10:49.915 --> 01:10:53.050
I'll work on me
and you'll work on you.

01:10:53.052 --> 01:10:54.420
Deal?

01:10:56.423 --> 01:10:57.523
Deal.

01:13:15.239 --> 01:13:17.607
- Vic!
- What?

01:13:17.609 --> 01:13:19.608
- We have to leave.
- Why?

01:13:19.610 --> 01:13:20.742
<i>All right.
These are the pictures</i>

01:13:20.744 --> 01:13:22.711
<i>I just posted of you and me.</i>

01:13:22.713 --> 01:13:25.281
And Shane likes some.
A bunch of people like some.

01:13:25.283 --> 01:13:27.784
Then I saw that
Bjorn likes some.

01:13:27.786 --> 01:13:30.220
And he doesn't have time
to call me back all day.

01:13:30.222 --> 01:13:32.523
Yet he had time
to check Instagram.

01:13:32.525 --> 01:13:33.890
I don't understand this.

01:13:33.892 --> 01:13:35.725
- Will you listen?
- Yes.

01:13:35.727 --> 01:13:38.596
So then, I noticed
that one of Bjorn's likes

01:13:38.598 --> 01:13:40.934
was also liked
by Zoey Campbell.

01:13:41.468 --> 01:13:43.702
Okay. Who's Zoey Campbell?

01:13:43.704 --> 01:13:46.605
She's the bitch who's been
trying to steal my boyfriend.

01:13:46.607 --> 01:13:49.406
The one Bjorn says
they're just friends, right?

01:13:49.408 --> 01:13:51.811
So then,
I look at her Instagram

01:13:51.813 --> 01:13:55.050
and see that she just happened
to post a selfie an hour ago.

01:13:56.717 --> 01:13:58.750
You're way
cuter than her.

01:13:58.752 --> 01:14:00.322
You got nothing
to worry about.

01:14:01.288 --> 01:14:05.424
That picture
was taken in my bed.

01:14:05.426 --> 01:14:07.829
I put that bottle there
this morning.

01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:26.015
Will you wait?

01:14:26.017 --> 01:14:27.815
Don't give him
the satisfaction.

01:14:27.817 --> 01:14:30.519
Satisfaction?
I am going to kill him

01:14:30.521 --> 01:14:32.020
and then
I'm going to kill her.

01:14:32.022 --> 01:14:33.822
Hey! Damn it. Hey!

01:14:33.824 --> 01:14:36.324
This is the last time.
I'm never going to...

01:14:43.702 --> 01:14:47.036
Oh, God.

01:14:47.038 --> 01:14:48.273
Oh.

01:14:50.609 --> 01:14:52.677
Vic, are you all right?

01:14:52.679 --> 01:14:55.879
Yeah, I'm fine.
I just got to catch my breath.

01:14:55.881 --> 01:15:00.116
Oh, shit. Sorry. Uh...
Oh, you look really pale.

01:15:00.118 --> 01:15:02.953
I've looked pale
for the past 30 years.

01:15:02.955 --> 01:15:06.191
Okay, no jokes. Do you think
you're having a heart attack?

01:15:06.193 --> 01:15:08.059
No, maybe I...

01:15:08.061 --> 01:15:09.795
I've had this before.

01:15:09.797 --> 01:15:12.130
Well, do you think we should
call an ambulance

01:15:12.132 --> 01:15:14.533
- just to be on the safe side?
- Don't be crazy.

01:15:14.535 --> 01:15:16.402
I just need a minute.

01:15:16.404 --> 01:15:18.570
Do you want some water?
You know what? Screw it.

01:15:18.572 --> 01:15:19.838
I'm gonna go get you
some water. Okay?

01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:21.744
Stay right here. All right?

01:15:23.311 --> 01:15:24.679
Oh, God.

01:15:35.657 --> 01:15:38.660
Oh, my God.
You're Vic Edwards.

01:15:38.662 --> 01:15:42.163
Gary, look.
This is Vic Edwards.

01:15:45.668 --> 01:15:47.201
Big fan of yours.
Not just in the movies,

01:15:47.203 --> 01:15:49.707
as a football player.
You were awesome.

01:15:50.874 --> 01:15:53.541
- <i>...River.</i>
- <i>The FBI.</i>

01:15:57.047 --> 01:15:58.684
We're both big fans...

01:16:08.893 --> 01:16:10.696
Whoa! Excuse me!

01:16:12.798 --> 01:16:14.565
Hi. Excuse me.
I really need water,

01:16:14.567 --> 01:16:16.566
please, right now. Thank you.

01:16:16.568 --> 01:16:18.935
Why? What're you doing
with the old guy?

01:16:18.937 --> 01:16:20.437
Baby, let me get you
a real drink.

01:16:20.439 --> 01:16:22.806
An appletini for my
future ex-wife.

01:16:27.881 --> 01:16:30.048
Oh. Oh, no. Excuse me.

01:16:30.050 --> 01:16:32.785
Excuse me. Hi. Have you seen
an old man right here?

01:16:32.787 --> 01:16:35.419
He was sitting
in that chair. No?

01:16:35.421 --> 01:16:36.758
No.

01:16:39.594 --> 01:16:41.727
Excuse me.
Uh, have you seen Mr. Edwards?

01:16:41.729 --> 01:16:44.097
He was just sitting on
the couch just a second ago.

01:16:44.099 --> 01:16:45.397
No, I haven't seen
Mr. Edwards.

01:16:45.399 --> 01:16:46.833
How are you
enjoying your suite?

01:16:46.835 --> 01:16:48.804
It's wonderful, thanks.

01:16:49.806 --> 01:16:51.237
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:16:51.239 --> 01:16:53.743
<i>an unexpected surprise.

01:16:57.847 --> 01:16:59.349

01:17:00.982 --> 01:17:03.018

- At your daughter's wedding.
- Absolutely.

01:18:07.755 --> 01:18:10.226
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

01:18:16.064 --> 01:18:18.999
Thank you.
It's an unexpected honor

01:18:19.001 --> 01:18:20.935
and treat to be able to sing

01:18:20.937 --> 01:18:22.703
one of my favorite songs

01:18:22.705 --> 01:18:26.845
to the new
Mr. and Mrs. Daniel Delson.

01:18:32.048 --> 01:18:33.217
What do you do, sir?

01:18:34.018 --> 01:18:35.616
I'm a doctor.

01:18:35.618 --> 01:18:37.386
Impressive. What kind?

01:18:37.388 --> 01:18:39.757
A colorectal surgeon.

01:18:40.190 --> 01:18:43.526
Hmm. You know, Mrs. Delson,

01:18:43.528 --> 01:18:44.961
you have
literally just married

01:18:44.963 --> 01:18:46.194
a pain in the ass.

01:18:49.434 --> 01:18:52.873
<i>Well, good luck to you
and mazel tov.</i>

01:19:05.986 --> 01:19:08.887
How did you know
Bjorn was such an asshole?

01:19:08.889 --> 01:19:10.821
You pegged him on sight.

01:19:10.823 --> 01:19:12.423
Well, it takes one
to know one.

01:19:12.425 --> 01:19:13.659
Yeah, yeah.

01:19:13.661 --> 01:19:15.327
Do yourself a favor.

01:19:15.329 --> 01:19:17.797
Steer clear of the bad boys
from now on.

01:19:17.799 --> 01:19:20.335
You can't fix us,
you can't tame us.

01:19:22.002 --> 01:19:24.169
- Okay, bad boy.
- Okay.

01:19:26.342 --> 01:19:29.812
What about that kid, Shane?
He obviously likes you.

01:19:30.445 --> 01:19:34.117
Wow, you pay closer attention
than I thought.

01:19:34.984 --> 01:19:37.149
Shane's been in love with me
since fifth grade.

01:19:37.151 --> 01:19:39.820
Well, then go out with him.

01:19:39.822 --> 01:19:41.488
Try out a guy
who really loves you.

01:19:41.490 --> 01:19:43.091
You might like it.

01:19:43.093 --> 01:19:45.659
Yeah, okay,
Mr. Divorced Five Times.

01:19:45.661 --> 01:19:48.028
How much do you really
even know about love?

01:19:48.030 --> 01:19:51.502
Were you ever even in love
with anyone but yourself?

01:19:52.803 --> 01:19:57.439
Ha-ha. I've been in love
about a thousand times.

01:19:57.441 --> 01:19:59.044
But real love?

01:19:59.710 --> 01:20:00.946
Just once.

01:20:04.549 --> 01:20:05.952
Just once.

01:20:17.363 --> 01:20:21.334
It was fun while
it lasted, wasn't it, Vic?

01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:24.203
We had some great times,
you and me.

01:20:26.073 --> 01:20:28.072
You got to do things
and see things

01:20:28.074 --> 01:20:29.743
that most people dream about.

01:20:30.811 --> 01:20:34.248
- Oh, yeah.
- Where'd it all go, man?

01:20:35.048 --> 01:20:37.081
And what does any of it mean?

01:20:37.083 --> 01:20:40.888
After all these years,
I still can't figure it out.

01:20:41.522 --> 01:20:42.824
What the game is about.

01:20:43.157 --> 01:20:46.758
Survival. Who has
the ability to survive.

01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:48.998
- That's the game.
- Yeah.

01:20:51.032 --> 01:20:54.236
Well, I'm surviving. Barely.

01:20:54.937 --> 01:20:56.506
I took it all for granted.

01:20:57.206 --> 01:20:59.075
I thought
I had it figured out.

01:21:00.776 --> 01:21:02.343
I look in the mirror now

01:21:02.345 --> 01:21:04.879
and I have no idea
who that person is,

01:21:04.881 --> 01:21:06.217
staring back at me.

01:21:13.858 --> 01:21:15.060
Damn.

01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:18.697
You're good-looking.

01:21:20.364 --> 01:21:22.701
You know,
time is like this river.

01:21:23.900 --> 01:21:25.902
No matter what you do
or don't do,

01:21:25.904 --> 01:21:28.371
no matter how much you think
you can beat it,

01:21:28.373 --> 01:21:31.044
it just keeps rushing by.

01:21:31.576 --> 01:21:33.310
You don't beat it.

01:21:33.312 --> 01:21:34.914
You don't beat this river.

01:21:36.214 --> 01:21:37.817
No, you don't.

01:22:00.507 --> 01:22:02.509
<i>Hey, Lil. You know who it is.</i>

01:22:02.511 --> 01:22:04.643
<i>Been kind of trying
to call you all night.</i>

01:22:04.645 --> 01:22:06.912
<i>Uh, just kind of wondering
where you are.</i>

01:22:06.914 --> 01:22:09.948
<i>You're still at that hotel
with that creepazoid old man.</i>

01:22:09.950 --> 01:22:12.288
<i>Anyway, call me back. Bye.</i>

01:22:23.165 --> 01:22:24.864
Vic, you are so right.

01:22:24.866 --> 01:22:26.534
The more I ignore
douchebag's calls,

01:22:26.536 --> 01:22:28.438
the crazier it's making him.

01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:31.843
Vic?

01:22:32.276 --> 01:22:33.510
Vic?

01:22:59.037 --> 01:23:01.307
Vic? Are you okay?

01:23:03.909 --> 01:23:07.213
I've watched everyone
I ever cared about die.

01:23:09.481 --> 01:23:12.218
One by one, they seem to just

01:23:13.588 --> 01:23:15.357
disappear on me.

01:23:16.324 --> 01:23:19.194
It won't be long
before I disappear, too.

01:23:20.527 --> 01:23:22.263
No, don't say that, Vic.

01:23:23.263 --> 01:23:26.334
You want to know why
I needed to come to Knoxville?

01:23:27.669 --> 01:23:29.539
I needed to say goodbye.

01:23:31.906 --> 01:23:35.010
Goodbye to the town
that made me who I am.

01:23:35.677 --> 01:23:38.545
Goodbye to the trees
I climbed as a kid.

01:23:38.547 --> 01:23:40.414
Goodbye to the school
that taught me

01:23:40.416 --> 01:23:42.186
how to break the rules.

01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:46.957
And the streets
I wandered late at night.

01:23:48.558 --> 01:23:52.363
The hiding places
where I left all my secrets.

01:23:54.364 --> 01:23:56.033
The town

01:23:56.766 --> 01:24:00.972
where I made so many,
many mistakes.

01:24:03.374 --> 01:24:08.379
And now it's time
for one last goodbye.

01:24:42.783 --> 01:24:44.650
Okay, Mrs. Schulman.

01:24:44.652 --> 01:24:48.155
You have a very
nice visitor today.

01:24:48.488 --> 01:24:49.822
Mr. Edwards has
come all the way

01:24:49.824 --> 01:24:51.827
from Los Angeles, California.

01:24:55.931 --> 01:24:57.930
Now, the Alzheimer's
may have progressed

01:24:57.932 --> 01:25:00.032
a little bit further
than you're prepared for,

01:25:00.034 --> 01:25:01.769
but she's still
a very sweet lady.

01:25:01.771 --> 01:25:03.641
Isn't that right,
Mrs. Schulman?

01:25:04.941 --> 01:25:06.373
All right, I'm gonna
leave you to visit.

01:25:06.375 --> 01:25:07.444
Okay.

01:25:15.820 --> 01:25:17.121
How's the food here?

01:25:25.831 --> 01:25:27.400
Look at us.

01:25:30.368 --> 01:25:31.469
Old fogeys.

01:25:36.876 --> 01:25:39.246
But you still look beautiful.

01:25:40.645 --> 01:25:44.150
You still look as beautiful
as the day I met you.

01:25:46.651 --> 01:25:49.324
We have a lot
of good memories.

01:25:51.859 --> 01:25:53.527
For what it's worth,

01:25:54.026 --> 01:25:56.530
I never loved
anybody else like you.

01:25:58.499 --> 01:26:00.702
Ours was the special one.

01:26:02.403 --> 01:26:04.102
The first one.

01:26:04.104 --> 01:26:05.840
The real one.

01:26:06.407 --> 01:26:09.111
I came here
to apologize, Claudia.

01:26:11.211 --> 01:26:12.744
I just dealt you...

01:26:15.251 --> 01:26:16.753
...a lousy hand.

01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:21.256
I was a stupid, jackass kid.

01:26:21.890 --> 01:26:24.925
All swept up in a crazy dream.

01:26:24.927 --> 01:26:27.296
And I just
left you and Gracie.

01:26:30.367 --> 01:26:32.302
I just left.

01:26:33.636 --> 01:26:35.271
I screwed it all up.

01:26:36.472 --> 01:26:39.974
If I could go back and
do it again, I would, baby.

01:26:39.976 --> 01:26:41.912
I'd do it differently.

01:26:43.914 --> 01:26:47.148
You were the one that loved me
before anybody else

01:26:47.150 --> 01:26:48.486
even knew my name.

01:26:49.554 --> 01:26:51.758
And I treated you like shit.

01:26:54.593 --> 01:26:56.993
I got caught up
in all the wrong things

01:26:56.995 --> 01:26:59.429
with all the wrong people.

01:26:59.431 --> 01:27:01.300
I thought I knew it all.

01:27:02.134 --> 01:27:05.505
I thought I had so much time
to make it up.

01:27:05.972 --> 01:27:08.772
I thought I could
just snap my fingers

01:27:08.774 --> 01:27:10.309
and make things right.

01:27:10.742 --> 01:27:12.513
And when Gracie

01:27:14.482 --> 01:27:15.750
killed herself...

01:27:19.487 --> 01:27:21.523
That was all my fault, too.

01:27:25.159 --> 01:27:27.028
It's all my fault.

01:27:42.210 --> 01:27:43.480
It is.

01:27:46.516 --> 01:27:48.185
Oh, darling.

01:28:05.202 --> 01:28:08.306
Excuse me. Do I know you?

01:28:19.417 --> 01:28:21.585
<i>You really want
to leave me here alone?</i>

01:28:21.587 --> 01:28:22.753
<i>Well, I really want some food.</i>

01:28:22.755 --> 01:28:23.887
<i>Well...</i>

01:28:23.889 --> 01:28:26.427
<i>I know I shouldn't
stop you, but I...</i>

01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:30.728
- <i>I feel safe with you around.</i>
- <i>You do?</i>

01:28:30.730 --> 01:28:31.895
<i>Well, I am safe, ain't I?</i>

01:28:31.897 --> 01:28:34.502
<i>Well, Justice will be back
in a minute.</i>

01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:36.702
<i>Justice ain't you.</i>

01:28:55.890 --> 01:28:59.726
Okay, that concludes
our Vic Edwards Film Festival.

01:28:59.728 --> 01:29:03.630
We are now gonna give out
our Lifetime Achievement Award

01:29:03.632 --> 01:29:06.269
to the great Vic Edwards
in absentia.

01:29:14.211 --> 01:29:16.545
I'm sure if Vic were here,

01:29:16.547 --> 01:29:18.613
he would want to
thank all the fans.

01:29:18.615 --> 01:29:19.816
Don't put words
in my mouth.

01:29:20.818 --> 01:29:24.389
For crying out loud.
Good Lord, man.

01:29:25.056 --> 01:29:26.456
Oh, my... Vic...

01:29:26.458 --> 01:29:27.623
Get me a chair.

01:29:27.625 --> 01:29:28.992
Yeah, yeah, of course.
Right away.

01:29:44.442 --> 01:29:47.146
Unfortunately, until today,

01:29:48.681 --> 01:29:52.017
the last time
I apologized for anything

01:29:52.019 --> 01:29:53.785
was in 1977.

01:29:53.787 --> 01:29:57.592
I punched out a director
on the set of <i>Horse Power.</i>

01:29:59.459 --> 01:30:02.197
Well...

01:30:03.831 --> 01:30:05.199
I'm sorry.

01:30:05.699 --> 01:30:07.868
I'm sorry for being
such an asshole.

01:30:09.537 --> 01:30:12.007
Leaving the way I did.

01:30:12.841 --> 01:30:16.678
I thought I was too good
for this little film festival,

01:30:18.047 --> 01:30:19.716
but as it turns out,

01:30:21.382 --> 01:30:23.185
it's too good
for the likes of me.

01:30:25.855 --> 01:30:28.558
Winning this
Lifetime Achievement Award

01:30:29.392 --> 01:30:32.627
has forced me to examine
an important question

01:30:32.629 --> 01:30:35.699
that I've avoided
as long as possible.

01:30:37.701 --> 01:30:40.704
What have I really achieved
in this lifetime?

01:30:43.741 --> 01:30:45.542
<i>Most of the movies I've made,</i>

01:30:45.910 --> 01:30:49.044
<i>everybody knows the way
they're gonna end.</i>

01:30:49.046 --> 01:30:51.347
<i>Right from the first scene.</i>

01:30:54.853 --> 01:30:57.053
<i>Life's kind of like that.</i>

01:30:57.055 --> 01:30:59.759
- <i>Everybody knows how it ends.</i>
- Back away!

01:31:02.427 --> 01:31:04.864
But it's the scenes
in the middle

01:31:07.333 --> 01:31:09.236
that make it count.

01:31:10.435 --> 01:31:14.573
<i>The great producer
Joseph E. Levine once told me,</i>

01:31:14.575 --> 01:31:17.879
<i>"An audience will forgive
a shitty act two,</i>

01:31:19.112 --> 01:31:22.883
"if you can wow them
in act three."

01:31:24.017 --> 01:31:25.521
Well...

01:31:26.454 --> 01:31:29.424
<i>I had a hell of an act one.</i>

01:31:30.224 --> 01:31:32.190
<i>Pretty shitty act two.</i>

01:31:32.192 --> 01:31:34.963
<i>And I screwed up
most of act three.</i>

01:31:36.464 --> 01:31:38.234
<i>I made certain of that.</i>

01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:40.901
But thanks to you

01:31:40.903 --> 01:31:45.975
and thanks to Doug and Shane
and Stuart and Faith.

01:31:47.809 --> 01:31:50.046
And especially Lil.

01:31:55.886 --> 01:31:57.922
<i>And everybody here.</i>

01:31:58.989 --> 01:32:01.791
<i>You've helped me to see that</i>

01:32:01.793 --> 01:32:05.097
<i>maybe it's not too late
for my Hollywood ending.</i>

01:32:30.290 --> 01:32:32.826
And so,
with humility and pride

01:32:35.094 --> 01:32:37.795
and deep appreciation

01:32:37.797 --> 01:32:40.833
that I, Martin Joel Schulman,

01:32:40.835 --> 01:32:42.369
proud son of Tennessee,

01:32:44.204 --> 01:32:47.975
humbly accept this Lifetime,

01:32:48.976 --> 01:32:50.345
so far,

01:32:52.681 --> 01:32:54.350
Achievement Award.

01:32:57.017 --> 01:33:00.055
And I'm gonna make damn sure
that the rest of my life

01:33:01.790 --> 01:33:03.959
lives up to the honor of this.

01:33:05.026 --> 01:33:06.295
Thank you.

01:33:25.483 --> 01:33:27.085
Thank you, Doug.

01:33:31.989 --> 01:33:34.423
I can't believe you just spent
the whole weekend

01:33:34.425 --> 01:33:36.425
in Knoxville with Vic Edwards.

01:33:36.427 --> 01:33:38.394
Did he talk about
<i>Murder Can Kill You?</i>

01:33:38.396 --> 01:33:39.865
Did he tell you any stories?

01:33:52.078 --> 01:33:53.614
Thank you.

01:34:02.956 --> 01:34:05.026
- Hmm.
- Bye, Marty.

01:34:05.793 --> 01:34:06.961
Hmm.

01:34:50.976 --> 01:34:53.478
Uh, Lil? Where do you
want this one?

01:34:55.446 --> 01:34:57.012
There.

01:34:57.014 --> 01:34:58.116
Yeah.

01:34:59.116 --> 01:35:00.084
<i>I told you so.</i>

01:35:00.652 --> 01:35:02.119
I know you did.

01:35:02.121 --> 01:35:03.520
And you were right.

01:35:03.522 --> 01:35:06.155
A Lifetime Achievement.
How can I get one of those?

01:35:06.157 --> 01:35:08.092
- Can I rent it?
- I told them

01:35:08.094 --> 01:35:11.128
about you
and they seemed interested.

01:35:11.130 --> 01:35:12.496
Oh, stop it.
