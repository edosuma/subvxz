How can I look Kodi

29:25.264 --> 29:27.099
Oh, Balto.

29:40.245 --> 29:44.049
He needs to know

You saved a lot of lives

That was some storm.

33:05.550 --> 33:07.152
It's okay.

Whoa, whoa there.

46:34.659 --> 46:37.261
I'm okay, I'm okay.

Do you hear the plane
anymore, Dad?

46:43.801 --> 46:45.336
No.

46:49.006 --> 46:50.841
Where the heck am I?

46:53.978 --> 46:55.780
Come on, baby.

46:58.082 --> 46:59.650
Oy!

47:29.814 --> 47:32.917
- Not the plane?
- <i>( dogs barking )</i>

47:37.688 --> 47:39.857
Balto!

47:47.965 --> 47:50.167

( cheering, barking )

48:26.237 --> 48:28.005
( howls )

48:33.210 --> 48:35.746
Yeah, if this doesn't
prove us dogs rule--

48:37.181 --> 48:38.716
what does?

49:04.241 --> 49:08.078
But I've seen them.
We can't do this
every time.

49:11.115 --> 49:13.184
You're just wrong.

49:50.688 --> 49:53.257
( laughing continues )

49:59.330 --> 50:02.433
Yeah... yeah, we do.

50:04.268 --> 50:07.938
And we're gonna keep them.
Come on, let's go.

50:26.257 --> 50:27.892
Balto!

51:30.087 --> 51:32.089

    only one has a heart.

53:05.416 --> 53:07.451
Who's coming with me?

53:21.498 --> 53:23.600
Dad, wait!

54:03.040 --> 54:05.542
And it served him right,
the stinker.

54:18.255 --> 54:20.157
What?

55:19.783 --> 55:22.286
in that funny way

    Come on,
let's get going.

56:48.939 --> 56:49.239
    They'll be looking
for that bush plane for weeks.

56:50.974 --> 56:53.143
    Listen, if anyone
can find him, Balto can.

57:00.550 --> 57:01.852
Yeah, Mom.

57:33.517 --> 57:36.920

I should have gone
with Balto.

57:42.192 --> 57:44.661

57:49.733 --> 57:53.003
Oh, he's probably griping about
what's taking us so long.

Onward.

I'm not sure
that's what I want to be.

   Male voice:
<i>Hey, lamebrain!</i>

01:06:37.727 --> 01:06:39.963
Yeah, I'm looking at one.

01:06:46.402 --> 01:06:48.938
( growling )

01:07:07.590 --> 01:07:09.459
Where are you?

01:07:13.229 --> 01:07:15.431
But I could swear he--

01:07:17.534 --> 01:07:19.702
( gasps )

01:07:38.555 --> 01:07:40.823
Luc says
he's found him!

01:08:01.578 --> 01:08:04.547
You owe me an apology!

01:08:18.493 --> 01:08:21.163
- it was enough!
- Easy does it, Luc.

01:08:28.705 --> 01:08:31.341
( groans )

01:08:47.857 --> 01:08:51.160
Come on, Stella,
we're going to take
Uncle Boris home.

01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:56.064
( groans )

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:12.582
( sighs )
I guess I won't be
walking back to Nome.

01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:27.563
( grunting )

01:09:55.625 --> 01:09:57.527
What? Oh!

01:09:58.961 --> 01:10:00.530
Oh no!

01:10:06.202 --> 01:10:08.438
( groans )

01:10:18.948 --> 01:10:20.883
Hang in there, boy.

01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:30.159
Now what?

01:10:36.999 --> 01:10:38.334
Kodi?

01:10:44.273 --> 01:10:47.643
( howls )

01:10:52.715 --> 01:10:54.884
Right on time, Son.

01:11:05.995 --> 01:11:09.966
- Don't count him out.
- <i>( distant howling )</i>

01:11:12.301 --> 01:11:14.771
( howling )

01:11:23.012 --> 01:11:25.882
( melancholy howl )

01:11:29.752 --> 01:11:34.223
- Kodi!
- ( murmuring )

01:11:50.072 --> 01:11:54.076
Good dogs!
Good boy, Balto.

01:11:58.147 --> 01:12:01.184
( townspeople exclaiming )

01:12:05.221 --> 01:12:08.724
- I knew he could do it.
- I lost my appetite.

01:12:22.772 --> 01:12:26.475
I forgot to say
you were a rotten, lying,
good-for-nothing snow goose!

01:12:40.156 --> 01:12:42.258
Now that's more like it.

01:13:43.252 --> 01:13:45.021
I like it already.

01:13:53.095 --> 01:13:55.398
( honking )

01:14:16.285 --> 01:14:18.054
Hey!
Hey, there he is!

01:14:19.088 --> 01:14:21.090
Living out a dream.

01:14:26.929 --> 01:14:30.833
<i>La, da, da, da, dah</i>

01:14:55.658 --> 01:15:01.197
    <i> Everything,</i>
<i>everything flies</i>

01:15:39.001 --> 01:15:44.740
        <i> The trout</i>
<i>that breaks the stream</i>

01:16:06.328 --> 01:16:12.501
    <i> Everything,</i>
<i>everything flies</i>

01:16:33.456 --> 01:16:38.127
<i>Oh-hhh!</i>

01:17:12.428 --> 01:17:18.634
<i>Everything flies</i>

01:17:43.893 --> 01:17:47.463
<i>Everything flies.</i>
