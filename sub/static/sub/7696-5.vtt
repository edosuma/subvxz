01:03.104 --> 01:04.981
<i>Previously on</i> Batman

01:05.064 --> 01:07.024
That's what ain't good for you.

01:07.149 --> 01:10.194
Having to keep going back
to Daggett for more of that stuff.

01:10.319 --> 01:12.280
You're right, Teddy. I can't.

01:12.405 --> 01:16.367
I'll have to find a way
to get lots of this stuff on my own.

01:16.492 --> 01:20.246
I think our Mr. Hagen
has outlived his usefulness.

01:20.705 --> 01:23.416
<i>I want him dealt with.</i>

01:23.499 --> 01:27.461
- No.
- Sweet dreams, slimeball.

01:30.047 --> 01:32.508
"Bruce Wayne
sought for questioning

01:32.592 --> 01:35.011
"in attempt on executive's life"?

01:59.744 --> 02:01.996
Mr. Wayne,
what was it like to be in jail?

02:02.079 --> 02:05.416
How do you respond to the
charges that you assaulted Lucius Fox?

02:05.499 --> 02:07.835
No comment. My client has no comment.

02:07.960 --> 02:10.212
- Let us through, please.
- Mr. Wayne, over here.

02:13.633 --> 02:15.051
Mr. Wayne, Mr. Wayne,
over here.

02:15.134 --> 02:16.302
Over here.

02:17.053 --> 02:18.846
Mr. Wayne, could you talk to us?

02:22.808 --> 02:26.604
Imagine, Lucius Fox thinking
I would harm him.

02:26.729 --> 02:30.024
And he's been with you,
what, ten years now, sir?

02:30.399 --> 02:33.694
Then whoever impersonated you
did an uncanny job.

02:34.111 --> 02:35.696
"Whoever" is right.

02:35.905 --> 02:37.448
Bell said he didn't know.

02:37.657 --> 02:39.033
He had to be lying.

02:39.158 --> 02:41.202
But I know where to get the truth.

02:52.630 --> 02:53.714
Move it, Lupus.

02:53.839 --> 02:56.384
I want all this stuff
out of here by sunrise.

02:56.592 --> 02:59.220
Ah, Matt, come on,
you don't have to do this.

02:59.345 --> 03:01.889
You made a comeback before.
You can do it again.

03:03.182 --> 03:04.308
Comeback?

03:04.725 --> 03:06.560
Comeback? From this?

03:07.186 --> 03:09.939
Face it, Teddy, Matt Hagen is history.

03:10.189 --> 03:11.482
This time, for good.

03:11.607 --> 03:13.067
He's never coming back again.

03:14.402 --> 03:18.197
My contact on the force
says Bell hasn't cracked, so far.

03:18.406 --> 03:22.076
Good. Well, I'm afraid we still have
quite a mess to clean up.

03:22.201 --> 03:26.080
Sooner or later, I will take control
of Wayne Enterprises.

03:32.545 --> 03:34.922
Their marketing operation
will instantly give me

03:35.005 --> 03:38.926
a distribution network that would
take me years to build on my own.

03:39.051 --> 03:44.014
Till then, my takeover plan
will have to be revised.

03:44.140 --> 03:49.520
Now that our actor friend,
Hagen, is no longer available to us.

03:51.605 --> 03:55.234
Okay, Mr. Daggett, who do you want
me to take out now?

03:56.485 --> 03:59.196
I want everything wrapped up
by the time I tape that show tonight.

03:59.321 --> 04:02.032
We're going to settle the Fox matter
once and for all.

04:02.158 --> 04:07.288
But, Mr. Daggett, he's in a hospital.
All those sick people...

04:13.669 --> 04:15.045
Okay, Mr. Daggett.

04:17.173 --> 04:18.174
But, Matt,

04:18.257 --> 04:20.384
you thought it was all over
for you once before,

04:20.468 --> 04:22.011
and you were wrong then.

04:22.094 --> 04:23.971
You know, when you had your accident.

04:24.221 --> 04:25.723
Of course I thought it was over.

04:26.223 --> 04:28.225
I figured I was lucky to be alive.

04:30.019 --> 04:33.731
<i>Just like I thought I was when Daggett
came to visit me at his clinic of his,</i>

04:33.856 --> 04:36.692
<i>asking me to be his first test subject.</i>

04:37.067 --> 04:38.319
<i>How could I say no?</i>

04:38.444 --> 04:41.530
<i>He told me his Renuyu formula
could do in minutes</i>

04:41.655 --> 04:44.408
<i>what plastic surgery would take years
to accomplish.</i>

04:52.208 --> 04:53.751
It wasn't so bad,

04:53.834 --> 04:56.921
except for all those jobs
you had to do for him in return.

04:59.298 --> 05:00.341
But, hey, it worked.

05:00.466 --> 05:02.927
I mean, you had your biggest hits
after the accident.

05:06.055 --> 05:09.725
Yeah. Some of the best parts I ever had.

05:13.395 --> 05:16.315
Matt! You're changing.

05:16.440 --> 05:18.359
And you didn't use your hands this time.

05:18.484 --> 05:20.277
You didn't even try.

05:20.528 --> 05:24.490
You did it automatically,
like a reflex or something.

05:24.657 --> 05:25.991
Unbelievable.

05:26.242 --> 05:27.868
You know what this means, don't you?

05:28.244 --> 05:30.162
It doesn't have to be over.

05:30.246 --> 05:31.539
You can go on.

05:31.664 --> 05:33.123
We can go on.

05:42.007 --> 05:43.300
Wow!

05:43.717 --> 05:46.720
You can even form clothes
out of your skin.

05:46.846 --> 05:48.556
But, how?

05:49.181 --> 05:52.017
The formula must've soaked
every cell in my body.

05:58.023 --> 06:00.484
It's... It's some kind of miracle.

06:03.779 --> 06:06.657
- What... What are you doing?
- No.

06:07.032 --> 06:09.743
No. You broke my concentration!

06:09.869 --> 06:12.204
It won't work, don't you see?
It's too hard.

06:12.329 --> 06:14.582
It's like tensing a muscle.

06:14.665 --> 06:16.333
I can't keep it up for long.

06:17.209 --> 06:19.628
My career, my life...

06:19.712 --> 06:20.713
It is gone!

06:20.796 --> 06:22.131
And I can never get it back!

06:26.176 --> 06:27.928
I'm not an actor anymore.

06:28.178 --> 06:30.472
I'm not even a man.

06:35.477 --> 06:36.645
Pull in here.

06:38.397 --> 06:39.398
The hospital?

06:39.732 --> 06:42.985
Sooner or later, Daggett will
send someone to finish off Fox.

06:43.110 --> 06:45.446
Once I know who it is, I can

06:45.988 --> 06:47.156
take his place.

06:47.281 --> 06:49.909
And if Daggett thinks I'm his henchman,

06:50.034 --> 06:51.994
I can walk right up to him and,

06:52.077 --> 06:53.162
"Bam!"

06:56.874 --> 06:58.918
Goodbye, Mr. Daggett.

07:46.924 --> 07:47.925
Hey!

08:09.738 --> 08:11.907
Let me out of here. Please.

08:11.991 --> 08:16.286
All these viruses and bacteria,
I could be infected.

08:16.412 --> 08:17.997
I know.

08:19.832 --> 08:23.335
Now, the man who impersonated
Bruce Wayne,

08:23.752 --> 08:25.629
I want his name.

08:25.713 --> 08:28.382
I, uh, I don't know who, uh...

08:31.343 --> 08:34.096
Hmm. Crimson fever.

08:34.430 --> 08:35.806
Lousy way to go.

08:36.223 --> 08:37.891
No cure, you know.

08:38.017 --> 08:40.019
The name. Now!

08:40.102 --> 08:42.271
Okay, okay, it was Hagen.

08:42.354 --> 08:44.898
Matt Hagen, the movie actor.

08:47.359 --> 08:48.902
It's the truth. I swear!

08:49.028 --> 08:50.654
Then, how did he fool Fox?

08:50.946 --> 08:54.408
He's good, but no actor,
no makeup, is that good.

08:54.783 --> 08:56.326
I... I don't know.

08:59.663 --> 09:00.664
You're crazy!

09:00.789 --> 09:02.207
Last chance.

09:02.708 --> 09:05.794
- Talk!
- All right. He had something.

09:06.003 --> 09:08.464
Something nobody else had. He could...

09:08.589 --> 09:10.174
Nice going, Batman.

09:11.258 --> 09:13.093
But I'll take it from here.

09:22.311 --> 09:24.354
- This is my collar.
- Just a moment.

09:37.117 --> 09:38.243
What in the name of...

09:38.368 --> 09:39.578
Shut up.

10:04.561 --> 10:06.021
Relax, Germs.

10:06.146 --> 10:08.774
You won't have to hang around hon
too long.

10:26.333 --> 10:28.127
What in the name of heaven...

10:30.462 --> 10:31.547
Back off!

11:17.134 --> 11:18.177
Huh?

11:30.480 --> 11:34.193
All that shape-changing
takes a lot out of you, doesn't it?

12:18.278 --> 12:20.072
<i>Tomorrow on Gotham</i> Insider,

12:20.155 --> 12:23.075
<i>my guest will be pharmaceutical king,
Roland Daggett,</i>

12:23.200 --> 12:27.454
<i>whose new product can perform
miracles even plastic surgery can't.</i>

12:29.915 --> 12:32.334
Not even the Batman can stop me, Teddy.

12:32.459 --> 12:35.379
And that means,
Daggett won't have a prayer.

12:35.504 --> 12:36.505
Matt, please.

12:37.631 --> 12:40.759
You don't want to do anything crazy.
Why don't you try to get some shuteye?

12:42.094 --> 12:44.680
Don't you dare patronize me!

12:44.805 --> 12:46.890
I told you, I don't need rest.

12:47.015 --> 12:48.308
I don't need food!

12:48.517 --> 12:50.852
And I don't need you!

12:56.608 --> 12:57.859
Ah!

13:11.999 --> 13:14.960
I've acquired the Matt Hagen
films you requested, sir.

13:15.085 --> 13:17.337
Good, because now I'm sure that

13:17.421 --> 13:19.631
that thing I fought
at the hospital is Hagen.

13:19.756 --> 13:21.925
His condition is apparently
the tragic result

13:22.009 --> 13:25.304
of an experiment conducted
by Roland Daggett.

13:25.429 --> 13:29.182
Hagen apparently transforms,
unconsciously sometimes,

13:29.349 --> 13:31.310
like a reflex action.

13:49.828 --> 13:51.913
<i>A face-lift in ajar?</i>

13:52.914 --> 13:55.042
<i>- I love that idea. That's interesting.</i>

13:55.167 --> 13:58.211
If you'll watch the monitors,
you'll see that with Renuyu,

13:58.378 --> 14:00.213
you can smooth away wrinkles,

14:00.339 --> 14:02.424
reshape imperfections.

14:02.549 --> 14:07.220
Literally, remake your face
however you choose.

14:07.596 --> 14:08.764
- Oh, that's great!
- Yeah.

14:16.271 --> 14:17.981
<i>Amazing stuff, Rolly.</i>

14:18.106 --> 14:20.650
<i>I see we have some questions
in our audience.</i>

14:20.776 --> 14:24.738
I'd like to ask Mr. Daggett
about the rumors I've heard.

14:24.863 --> 14:27.699
I hear he's selling Renuyu
through direct marketing

14:27.866 --> 14:31.995
because stores won't carry it
due to its harmful side effects.

14:32.120 --> 14:33.830
Well, that's, uh...

14:34.623 --> 14:36.416
Absolutely untrue.

14:36.541 --> 14:40.504
What about the addictive properties
of Renuyu, Mr. Daggett?

14:40.629 --> 14:42.547
How, once you're hooked on it,

14:42.631 --> 14:46.426
you can't stop using it
without horrible pain?

14:46.551 --> 14:48.053
No. I mean...

14:48.136 --> 14:49.763
That's just not so.

14:53.642 --> 14:57.521
Why don't you show them
what an overdose can do, Daggett.

14:57.646 --> 15:01.191
Why don't you tell them about me?

15:30.345 --> 15:31.972
Huh?

15:36.309 --> 15:37.310
Huh?

16:22.314 --> 16:23.440
You again.

16:23.565 --> 16:25.775
Hagen, listen to me.

16:26.276 --> 16:27.360
There is no Hagen.

16:27.486 --> 16:30.197
It's only me now, Clayface.

17:26.753 --> 17:30.715
See? I figured out
how to manage this thing pretty good.

18:37.365 --> 18:39.701
What are you doing? Stop it!

18:40.285 --> 18:41.620
Look at them, Hagen.

18:41.911 --> 18:43.830
Look at what you used to be.

18:44.831 --> 18:47.000
No. No.

18:47.250 --> 18:48.460
Turn them off.

18:48.543 --> 18:50.462
You can play those roles again, Hagen.

18:50.587 --> 18:53.131
Let me help you find a cure.

18:53.256 --> 18:55.508
No! Hagen's gone.

18:55.634 --> 18:57.302
Make him stop haunting me!

19:10.774 --> 19:12.609
Stop it. Stop it. Turn them off.

19:12.734 --> 19:13.777
I can't control it.

19:13.860 --> 19:15.904
I can't be all of them. Not all at once.

19:26.790 --> 19:28.083
Stop!

19:48.144 --> 19:49.437
Mother of mercy.

19:49.562 --> 19:51.648
It looks just like Bruce Wayne.

20:13.128 --> 20:16.047
You know what I'd have given
for a death scene like this?

20:16.673 --> 20:18.049
Too bad I won't get to...

20:18.758 --> 20:20.301
Read the notices.

20:30.437 --> 20:31.604
<i>I'm just glad to know</i>

20:31.688 --> 20:33.690
<i>it wasn't really Bruce Wayne
who attacked me.</i>

20:33.815 --> 20:35.358
<i>Thank you, Mr. Fox.</i>

20:35.483 --> 20:37.277
<i>All charges against Wayne have,</i>

20:37.402 --> 20:38.695
<i>of course, been dropped.</i>

20:38.820 --> 20:41.531
<i>And Roland Daggett remains in custody.</i>

20:46.828 --> 20:47.829
Mmm.

20:48.288 --> 20:49.539
My word, sir.

20:49.664 --> 20:52.625
I should think after all this,
it would be time to rest.

20:52.751 --> 20:53.752
Look.

20:53.918 --> 20:57.213
A piece of clay left behind
when they took Hagen's body away.

20:57.839 --> 20:58.840
Watch.

21:05.847 --> 21:08.308
Electricity has no effect on it?

21:08.433 --> 21:09.434
Exactly.

21:10.477 --> 21:11.728
<i>I wouldn't be surprised</i>

21:11.811 --> 21:14.981
<i>if the body they took
to the morgue was only a shell.</i>

21:17.150 --> 21:20.612
<i>Don't forget, first and foremost,
Hagen was an actor.</i>

21:21.488 --> 21:23.198
<i>He said it himself, Alfred,</i>

21:23.406 --> 21:24.783
<i>he called it a scene.</i>

21:24.866 --> 21:27.702
<i>Maybe the greatest scene of his career.</i>

21:28.286 --> 21:29.871
See you around, Matt.
