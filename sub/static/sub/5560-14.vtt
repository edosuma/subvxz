Miss Doe, Agent Zapata,

04:51.610 --> 04:55.855

But you can't afford a really good lawyer.

She's out sick today.

- She's fine.

05:12.279 --> 05:13.991
Patterson, you have a tattoo for us?

05:14.059 --> 05:16.324
No... I have two.

05:16.392 --> 05:20.482
The lion is on Jane's
right calf, and the bull

05:20.550 --> 05:22.154
is on the left side of her waist,

05:22.222 --> 05:24.025
so I was looking at them separately.

05:24.093 --> 05:27.659
But when you put them together
and translate the Spanish,

05:27.727 --> 05:29.218
you get a Shakespeare quote.

05:29.286 --> 05:33.622
"Some rise by sin and some by virtue fall."

05:33.690 --> 05:36.338
Now, take a look at the numbers here.

05:36.406 --> 05:37.716
And this is where it gets interesting,

05:37.784 --> 05:40.915
because "sin" is also
an abbreviation for sine.

05:40.983 --> 05:42.162
So, it's trigonometry.

05:42.230 --> 05:43.255
Yes!

05:43.323 --> 05:45.528
What is the most famous
lion in New York City?

05:45.596 --> 05:47.824
And I'll give you a hint. It's a tie.

05:47.892 --> 05:49.358
The statues outside of the Public Library.

05:49.426 --> 05:51.615
And what is New York's most famous bull?

05:51.682 --> 05:52.562
The Charging Bull

05:52.630 --> 05:54.701
- in the Financial District.
- Right.

05:54.769 --> 05:56.751
We have two points of a triangle,

05:56.819 --> 05:59.259
and I think we're supposed
to solve for the third.

05:59.327 --> 06:05.043
So, what angles can you take the
sine of to get .9658 and .8367?

06:05.142 --> 06:07.004
All right, can we fast
forward to the answer, please?

06:07.072 --> 06:09.458
Well, before we get there,

06:09.526 --> 06:12.825
there's just one other thing
that you should probably know.

06:12.893 --> 06:15.439
(Mayfair) This is how
you cracked the tattoo?

06:15.506 --> 06:16.804
An anonymous email?

06:16.872 --> 06:19.324
This is a massive security breach!

06:19.392 --> 06:21.543
You should have reported
it to ITB immediately.

06:21.611 --> 06:24.655
I did. I mean, we've been
working on it for hours already,

06:24.723 --> 06:26.294
but they used a VPN.

06:26.362 --> 06:28.069
It just traces back to the Arctic Circle.

06:28.137 --> 06:32.969
And you thought it was a good idea to
use this magical intel from the North Pole

06:33.037 --> 06:34.224
to solve a puzzle?

06:34.292 --> 06:37.420
Patterson, what's the location
the tattoos lead us to?

06:37.488 --> 06:39.217
You kidding me? We can't follow it now.

06:39.340 --> 06:42.275
(Weller) Whoever sent that email had to
have intimate knowledge of Jane's tattoos.

06:42.343 --> 06:44.823
So, my guess would be the
same people who put 'em on her.

06:44.891 --> 06:47.055
Maybe something about
this case has changed.

06:47.123 --> 06:48.816
So, where does this third point...?

06:48.884 --> 06:51.645
You end up with four possible locations.

06:51.713 --> 06:54.478
Three of them are in bodies of water.

06:54.923 --> 06:56.379
But the fourth...

06:56.478 --> 06:57.845
is on a street in Queens.

07:13.423 --> 07:15.198
20 feet from this spot.

07:16.203 --> 07:18.331

a 24-year-old girl who
lived in the neighborhood.

08:54.228 --> 08:58.528
She was the lead singer of a local band
until she was killed seven years ago.

He was convicted of her murder and

His execution is tomorrow night.

09:16.047 --> 09:17.893

09:17.961 --> 09:19.776
So, we need to solve this case, fast.

09:19.844 --> 09:21.233
Maybe he was wrongfully convicted.

09:21.301 --> 09:22.554
State's case was strong.

09:22.622 --> 09:23.972
They said he was abusive,

09:24.040 --> 09:26.595
that he forced Paloma to overstay her visa.

09:26.663 --> 09:29.422
After she got caught
and deported to Mexico,

09:29.560 --> 09:30.865
Ronnie apparently went after her

09:30.933 --> 09:32.668
and snuck her back into the country.

09:32.736 --> 09:34.637
A few months later, he raped her,

09:34.766 --> 09:36.672
he strangled her to death

09:36.803 --> 09:38.841
and dumped her body, and
it washed up in Delaware.

09:38.909 --> 09:40.843
Easy to see why a jury would convict him.

09:40.929 --> 09:42.501
(Patterson) That's what
Ronnie's lawyers thought.

09:42.569 --> 09:43.746
And they advised him to take a deal,

09:43.814 --> 09:45.501
but he kept insisting that he was innocent.

09:55.082 --> 09:56.181
They took his case.

09:56.249 --> 09:58.069
They're really picky about the
defendants they'll represent.

09:58.137 --> 10:00.134
They must have had a damn
good reason to trust Ronnie.

10:00.202 --> 10:03.243

11:05.163 --> 11:07.799
Ronnie insisted for years
that he didn't kill Paloma,

11:07.867 --> 11:10.486
refused a plea deal that
would've kept him off death row,

11:10.554 --> 11:12.415

11:22.877 --> 11:24.278
(exhaling)

11:30.129 --> 11:31.662
(TV turning off)

11:32.848 --> 11:35.784
(grunting)

11:50.534 --> 11:51.534
Jane.

11:55.690 --> 11:57.096
What are you doing here?

11:57.164 --> 11:59.058
I have a session with Borden.

11:59.126 --> 12:02.117
I figured I shouldn't miss
that just for a migraine.

12:02.307 --> 12:05.969
Look, I know that
yesterday was a tough day.

12:06.432 --> 12:09.496
If there's something else
going on, you can tell me.

12:09.965 --> 12:10.940
Weller.

12:11.008 --> 12:13.629
Reade just got back and
needs to talk to you.

12:13.697 --> 12:15.030
If you need anything...

12:15.545 --> 12:16.456
I know.

12:16.524 --> 12:18.782
If you're sick, you should
be at home getting better.

12:18.850 --> 12:20.703
And hypothetically, if you're not sick,

12:20.770 --> 12:22.638
if you're just nursing your wounded pride

12:22.706 --> 12:24.209
about what happened yesterday,

12:24.277 --> 12:26.333
you should be at home doing that too.

12:26.463 --> 12:29.345
I'm just here for my session with Borden.

12:29.843 --> 12:32.247
Are... are you guys
working on a new tattoo?

12:32.363 --> 12:33.948
We got an anonymous tip.

12:34.016 --> 12:35.663
It led us to a death row case.

12:35.731 --> 12:37.369
Time sensitive, so...

12:37.437 --> 12:38.921
You got a tip this morning?

12:38.989 --> 12:41.390
I have a time-sensitive tattoo.

12:41.683 --> 12:44.284
Yeah, an encrypted email.

12:46.162 --> 12:47.896
Borden is waiting.

12:50.912 --> 12:52.668
(Reade) Ronnie told the
Innocence Clinic attorney

12:52.736 --> 12:53.925
Paloma was the love of his life

12:53.993 --> 12:55.807
and the state's case against him was a lie.

12:55.875 --> 12:58.326
He also told her he went to
Mexico after she was deported,

12:58.394 --> 12:59.950
but he couldn't find her.

13:00.018 --> 13:02.931
He didn't even know she was back in
the states until they found her body.

13:02.999 --> 13:04.076
The lawyer believed him.

13:04.144 --> 13:05.505
So, why'd she drop the case?

13:05.573 --> 13:07.491
She didn't... two weeks
in, Ronnie pulls a 180,

13:07.559 --> 13:09.420
says he's guilty and refused any more help.

13:09.488 --> 13:11.808
Exactly the same thing that he said to us.

13:11.876 --> 13:13.495
So, what the hell changed?

13:13.563 --> 13:15.081
His sister's house burned down.

13:15.149 --> 13:15.983
- What?
- Two weeks after Ronnie

13:16.051 --> 13:17.051
talked to that lawyer.

13:17.119 --> 13:19.373
The sister and her three
kids barely made it out alive.

13:19.441 --> 13:21.343
- It was a threat.
- (Weller) So, someone was making Ronnie

13:21.411 --> 13:23.143
take the fall for Paloma's murder

13:23.211 --> 13:24.626
or they'd kill more people that he loved.

13:24.694 --> 13:27.541
If Ronnie is innocent, then who
killed Paloma and framed him for it?

13:27.609 --> 13:30.010
(Reade) There was a witness
in Ronnie's original trial

13:30.078 --> 13:31.244
who claimed he could get Ronnie off,

13:31.312 --> 13:33.188
but backed off last minute.

13:33.256 --> 13:34.972
Innocence Clinic figured
it was witness tampering,

13:35.040 --> 13:37.293
which was what drew them to
the case in the first place.

13:37.361 --> 13:41.203
The witness was an ICE
agent named Timothy Eavers.

13:42.447 --> 13:43.886
You guys are killing me.
Do you remember everything

13:43.954 --> 13:45.237
that happened to you seven years ago?

13:45.305 --> 13:48.207
Just the things that involve
a federal murder trial.

13:48.458 --> 13:50.392
That's why I backed out then.

13:51.034 --> 13:52.411
My memory's bad.

13:52.479 --> 13:53.562
Do you know how many faces I see in a day?

13:53.630 --> 13:55.079
A man is about to be put to death.

13:55.147 --> 13:57.208
- And I'm sorry about that.
- Tomorrow.

13:57.276 --> 13:59.586
Lethal injections aren't as
painless as they make them out to be.

13:59.654 --> 14:02.556
If they get the dosage
wrong, it can take a while.

14:05.456 --> 14:07.598
Speaking up about Paloma Diaz
almost cost me everything.

14:07.666 --> 14:09.101
What do you mean?

14:12.227 --> 14:15.386
Just after I came forward,
my boss at ICE, Scott Stern,

14:15.454 --> 14:17.297
slapped me with a bogus
sexual harassment charge,

14:17.365 --> 14:18.755
then he said he'd fired me if I testified.

14:18.823 --> 14:20.994
- Who would hire me after that?
- So, you backed down?

14:21.062 --> 14:24.514
I have a family. I need this job.

14:25.913 --> 14:27.142
I didn't know what
would happen to that kid.

14:27.210 --> 14:29.317
If you tell us what you know,
we can protect you from Stern.

14:29.385 --> 14:31.154
He won't be able to threaten you anymore.

14:31.222 --> 14:33.786
It's not too late to do the right thing.

14:33.955 --> 14:36.374
You can still save this kid's life.

14:39.253 --> 14:40.891
A couple days after Paloma got deported,

14:40.959 --> 14:42.565
her mother called in to
the office and told me

14:42.633 --> 14:44.417
she never showed up in Mexico.

14:44.485 --> 14:46.531
- She got on the wrong bus?
- She got on the right bus.

14:46.599 --> 14:48.352
I checked the security tapes.

14:48.420 --> 14:49.511
She just never made it to the border.

14:49.579 --> 14:50.831
So, where did they take her?

14:50.899 --> 14:52.623
And why did Stern want to cover it up?

14:52.691 --> 14:56.720
I don't know. I stopped asking when
they threatened to destroy my life.

14:58.619 --> 15:02.581
(Jane) They thought it was
me, that I was the mole.

15:02.649 --> 15:05.094
From what I understand,
it was quite the opposite.

15:05.247 --> 15:07.481
Wasn't Agent Weller the
one who exonerated you?

15:07.549 --> 15:11.106
Yeah, I... I know that.
I mean... the others.

15:11.260 --> 15:14.178
When Fischer was walking
me out, I could tell.

15:15.432 --> 15:17.046
They thought it was me.

15:17.114 --> 15:19.721
Jane, that was an incredibly
stressful day for everyone.

15:19.789 --> 15:20.883
I really wouldn't give much credence to...

15:20.950 --> 15:22.484
They were right.

15:24.806 --> 15:26.530
Why should they trust me?

15:28.307 --> 15:30.333
Why should I trust myself?

15:30.500 --> 15:34.045
You know, I... I could have
been anyone before this.

15:34.113 --> 15:35.292
The work that you have done here...

15:35.360 --> 15:37.573
I don't think I can do this anymore.

15:39.468 --> 15:41.168
I wanna stop.

15:42.679 --> 15:45.247
I want to leave the FBI.

15:47.143 --> 15:49.770
I took a closer look at Paloma's file.

15:49.838 --> 15:52.510
The booking agent who checked
her into the detention center

15:52.635 --> 15:53.999
was an Agent Stern.

15:54.067 --> 15:55.541
Eavers' boss, the one who shut him down.

15:55.609 --> 15:57.910
Exactly. Take a look at this.

15:57.978 --> 16:01.083
Her birthdate is 100 years off.

16:01.151 --> 16:03.303
1885 instead of 1985.

16:03.371 --> 16:04.416
That could just be a typo.

16:04.484 --> 16:08.139
I ran a larger search on all the
files logged in by Agent Stern.

16:08.207 --> 16:11.691
Turns out, he's made that typo
a lot over the past seven years.

16:11.759 --> 16:13.168
Look.

16:13.375 --> 16:17.483
1891, 1884, 1888.

16:17.551 --> 16:19.813
It's a signal. He's earmarking them.

16:19.881 --> 16:24.872
Stern assigns these women to deportation
buses with the same driver, Hank Aubin,

16:24.940 --> 16:26.520
the one who drove Paloma's bus.

16:26.588 --> 16:30.485
How many? How many women?

16:30.553 --> 16:32.521
Hundreds.

16:33.125 --> 16:35.390
As recent as last week.

16:35.769 --> 16:37.652
They're trafficking women.

16:44.635 --> 16:47.154
(Zapata) Both Stern and Aubin
were offered several promotions

16:47.222 --> 16:48.853
and both turned them down.

16:48.921 --> 16:51.727
They must be getting paid off
to keep their current positions.

16:51.795 --> 16:54.742
That way, they have
access to a constant new...

16:54.810 --> 16:55.565
supply of women.

16:55.633 --> 16:59.439
The ICE agents aren't the ringleaders of
this operation, they're the middle men.

16:59.507 --> 17:01.250
We need to find out whoever's at the top.

17:01.318 --> 17:02.421
(Mayfair) Bad news.

17:02.489 --> 17:05.813
The judge won't stay
Ronnie Vargas' execution.

17:05.881 --> 17:09.484
Paloma's mom died last
year, so she can't testify

17:09.553 --> 17:12.053
that Paloma never made it back to Mexico.

17:12.121 --> 17:15.778
Without her, we just have
seven-year-old hearsay evidence

17:15.846 --> 17:18.209
from a discredited ICE agent.

17:18.277 --> 17:23.362
The only way we can save Ronnie Vargas from
execution is to find Paloma's real killer.

17:23.430 --> 17:26.867
And the best way to do that is to find out
the person who's trafficking these women.

17:26.935 --> 17:28.337
(Reade) We should bring in Stern and Aubin.

17:28.405 --> 17:31.583
No. If we bring them in,
it'll tip off the real killer.

17:31.651 --> 17:34.132
There's something else we could try.

17:34.200 --> 17:37.710
There's a girl at the detention
center with an earmarked birthday.

17:37.778 --> 17:41.587
She's scheduled to be put on
Aubin's bus this afternoon.

17:41.736 --> 17:45.426
All right. So, if we tag that
bus, we'll see who takes her.

17:45.494 --> 17:47.157
(Mayfair) Absolutely not.

17:47.225 --> 17:50.869
We cannot put an innocent
civilian in harm's way.

17:51.995 --> 17:53.963
So, put me on the bus instead.

17:57.184 --> 17:58.873
We just keep talking in circles.

17:58.941 --> 18:01.485
Perhaps that's because you're
uncertain about leaving.

18:01.553 --> 18:03.679
I didn't choose any of this.

18:03.747 --> 18:05.429
- I know that.
- No.

18:05.497 --> 18:06.459
You don't understand.

18:06.527 --> 18:08.239
Then explain it to me.

18:08.457 --> 18:10.728
I know how freeing it must seem
to walk away from all of this,

18:10.796 --> 18:12.811
but running from your
problems doesn't fix them.

18:12.879 --> 18:15.374
No, it might fix this.

18:15.442 --> 18:17.761
What is it that you're not telling me?

18:17.829 --> 18:19.070
Hm?

18:19.138 --> 18:22.186
You're hiding something.
You have been for weeks.

18:22.388 --> 18:24.389
I can't help you if you
won't tell me the truth.

18:24.456 --> 18:25.754
I'm not asking you to help me.

18:25.822 --> 18:27.187
Yes, you are.

18:27.255 --> 18:28.962
You want me to tell you
that it's okay to walk away,

18:29.030 --> 18:30.481
but I won't do that.

18:30.549 --> 18:32.695
Not without seeing the bigger picture.

18:32.763 --> 18:35.148
So, unless you're willing to
be completely open with me,

18:35.216 --> 18:37.184
we are done here.

18:46.331 --> 18:50.381
This locket has a listening
device and a GPS tracker inside,

18:50.485 --> 18:52.569
so we can follow you
while you're undercover.

18:52.637 --> 18:54.218
It's cute, right?

18:54.904 --> 18:56.588
Not your style. That's cool.

18:56.656 --> 18:57.799
This thing is one way, right?

18:57.867 --> 18:59.134
You guys can hear what's
happening on my end,

18:59.202 --> 19:01.167
- but I can't hear you?
- Right.

19:02.335 --> 19:04.222
Now, we know that Stern earmarks the girls

19:04.290 --> 19:07.303
for Aubin to take off the bus
at some point during the trip.

19:07.371 --> 19:08.540
We don't know when or where.

19:08.608 --> 19:11.101
Cruz, 4A.

19:11.169 --> 19:13.832
(Zapata) So, basically, I
can be abducted at any time.

19:13.900 --> 19:15.804
No. We'll be tailing you

19:15.872 --> 19:17.449
the whole time in a surveillance unit.

19:17.517 --> 19:19.491
Reade and I will be in
the back, monitoring you.

19:19.559 --> 19:21.003
You'll never be alone.

19:21.071 --> 19:24.048
Once they separate you, remain undercover.

19:24.168 --> 19:26.751
We'll follow you back to
wherever they're taking the women.

19:26.975 --> 19:29.276
(Zapata) And to whoever's behind this.

19:36.037 --> 19:39.282
We're gonna have to talk about
this Sarah situation eventually.

19:42.102 --> 19:43.216
Look, I'm sorry it's your sister,

19:43.284 --> 19:44.940
and I'm sorry I didn't
tell you earlier, but I...

19:45.008 --> 19:46.437
Reade, don't.

19:46.825 --> 19:48.459
Kurt, I love her.

19:53.178 --> 19:58.182
This conversation... this is the problem.

19:58.250 --> 20:01.534
I can't have your personal
life interfering with our work.

20:01.683 --> 20:03.367
All right?

20:04.602 --> 20:07.158
A little hypocritical, but okay.

20:07.226 --> 20:08.893
Excuse me?

20:08.961 --> 20:11.084
Sarah and I have been dating for weeks,

20:11.152 --> 20:13.030
and no one at the FBI had a clue.

20:13.098 --> 20:17.568
Meanwhile, your feelings for Jane have
clouded your judgment since day one.

20:20.973 --> 20:23.074
The bus is pulling over.

20:28.223 --> 20:30.259
(speaking in Spanish) _

20:30.966 --> 20:31.838
_

20:31.906 --> 20:35.564
You have <i>cinco minutos</i>
to use the <i>baño.</i>

20:35.632 --> 20:38.577
<i>Cinco minutos.</i>

20:41.026 --> 20:42.426
(Reade) Is this a scheduled stop?

20:42.494 --> 20:43.427
No.

20:46.255 --> 20:49.024
Everybody off the bus, let's go.

21:01.813 --> 21:03.695
Sounds normal so far.

21:32.951 --> 21:34.863
(Reade) All right, here they come.

21:41.151 --> 21:43.452
I can't see her. That
truck's blocking my view.

21:43.520 --> 21:44.909
You got eyes on her?

21:45.745 --> 21:47.567
Yeah, I got her.

21:47.981 --> 21:49.266
She's on the bus.

21:49.334 --> 21:50.919
All right, we're good to go.

21:51.089 --> 21:52.390
Let's move.

22:15.515 --> 22:17.185
Weller, something's up.

22:17.253 --> 22:19.327
I haven't heard anything
from Zapata in a half hour.

22:19.395 --> 22:21.315
She's probably keeping a low profile.

22:21.436 --> 22:23.547
I think we should do a pass by the bus.

22:23.615 --> 22:25.392
It's too risky getting that close.

22:25.460 --> 22:28.162
It'll tip off Aubin that we're tailing him.

22:28.378 --> 22:31.287
We need visual confirmation
Zapata's still there.

22:37.171 --> 22:38.606
Pass the bus on the right.

22:38.674 --> 22:40.209
Not too fast.

22:41.319 --> 22:42.677
What row's she in?

22:42.791 --> 22:44.758
Fourth against the window.

22:54.472 --> 22:56.157
Son of a bitch. She's not there.

22:56.225 --> 22:57.859
Where the hell is she?

22:58.160 --> 23:00.028
Stop! Take us back, now!

23:00.095 --> 23:02.030
(tires screeching)

23:12.047 --> 23:14.448
(gasping lightly)

23:18.819 --> 23:21.954
(whispering Hail Mary in Spanish)

23:27.753 --> 23:29.457
(panicked breathing)

23:29.525 --> 23:31.683
Uh-uh, not so fast.

23:31.881 --> 23:34.116
You'll just throw up everywhere.

23:36.291 --> 23:37.254
You wait here.

23:37.322 --> 23:39.090
I'll come to get you in an hour.

23:39.158 --> 23:41.624
You should be more presentable by then.

23:46.903 --> 23:49.905
(panicked breathing)

23:56.306 --> 23:58.119
I'm Natalie.

23:59.233 --> 24:00.995
What's your name?

24:01.164 --> 24:02.136
Maria.

24:02.281 --> 24:03.209
Maria.

24:03.277 --> 24:05.111
- (speaking Spanish)
- No, no, shh.

24:07.592 --> 24:10.761
They get mad if we don't speak English.

24:11.172 --> 24:15.033
You are religious. That's good.

24:15.139 --> 24:16.878
You'll need it here.

24:17.952 --> 24:19.819
How the hell did we lose her?

24:22.156 --> 24:24.360
(Weller) The tracker's still on the bus.

24:24.428 --> 24:25.647
He must have taken it off her.

24:25.714 --> 24:28.672
Damn, we never should have
let her go in there, man!

24:28.740 --> 24:29.774
(Patterson) <i>I've got her
on a parking lot camera.</i>

24:29.842 --> 24:31.475
<i>I'm sending it to you now.</i>

24:32.935 --> 24:34.017
(Weller) Any idea who they are?

24:34.085 --> 24:36.768
I ran their faces through our
database and I got a hit on the woman.

24:36.836 --> 24:38.826
It's a match for Camila Solis.

24:38.894 --> 24:41.577
Her paperwork claims she
was deported seven years ago

24:41.645 --> 24:43.262
<i>around the same time as Paloma.</i>

24:43.330 --> 24:45.124
So, she's moved from victim to accomplice?

24:45.192 --> 24:47.114
It's not uncommon for long-term captives

24:47.182 --> 24:49.371
to align themselves with their kidnappers.

24:49.439 --> 24:51.210
- So, how do we find them?
- (Patterson) <i>Before the handoff,</i>

24:51.278 --> 24:52.937
there's footage of Camila
using the gas station

24:53.005 --> 24:55.792
across the street using
a pre-paid gas card.

24:55.860 --> 24:57.545
Great... just as untraceable as cash.

24:57.613 --> 24:58.605
Yes and no.

24:58.673 --> 24:59.575
You can't get an ID off it,

24:59.643 --> 25:01.894
but I was able to track
the purchase history.

25:01.962 --> 25:04.105
This card has only been
used at gas stations

25:04.173 --> 25:06.005
within a five-mile radius of the diner.

25:06.073 --> 25:08.903
(Mayfair) They must be moving the
women to another form of transportation

25:08.971 --> 25:10.696
<i>to traffic them out of the area.</i>

25:10.764 --> 25:12.460
Any private airfields in the radius?

25:12.528 --> 25:13.537
Yeah, one.

25:13.605 --> 25:16.974
Also, three train stations, two harbors.

25:17.042 --> 25:19.885
I've sent Camila's picture to all of
them to see if anyone recognizes her.

25:19.953 --> 25:22.733
We have to intercept that van before
they ship Tasha somewhere else.

25:22.801 --> 25:24.642
Or discover she's an agent.

25:29.262 --> 25:30.438
Where are we at on the registration?

25:30.506 --> 25:33.001
It's a dead-end. They used a fake ID.

25:33.069 --> 25:35.416
Wait, Zapata's undercover?

25:35.779 --> 25:37.298
I thought you were sick.

25:37.421 --> 25:39.336
She's in trouble.

25:39.537 --> 25:40.602
Yeah.

25:40.731 --> 25:42.522
What can I do?

25:43.250 --> 25:44.897
What happens here?

25:46.056 --> 25:49.397
Well, see, in the daytime,
we sleep down here.

25:49.715 --> 25:53.805
And most nights, we get dressed up

25:53.873 --> 25:59.741
and the guard comes and takes
us upstairs to the parties.

25:59.854 --> 26:03.548
The man who hosts these
parties, his name is Mr. Tate.

26:03.725 --> 26:05.072
He's some kind of businessman,

26:05.140 --> 26:07.726
and the other men are his clients.

26:07.794 --> 26:09.644
He brings them here to entertain them

26:09.712 --> 26:11.779
and to impress them.

26:13.988 --> 26:16.624
The clients get to choose whoever they want

26:17.298 --> 26:19.395
and do whatever they want.

26:19.826 --> 26:23.493
(Zapata) The other girls are upstairs.

26:23.561 --> 26:26.229
Why didn't you have to go?

26:34.133 --> 26:36.450
The guards are not
supposed to hurt us badly

26:36.518 --> 26:40.732
because it makes us
unattractive to the clients.

26:40.933 --> 26:44.498
There is a tall man, he has a temper.

26:45.872 --> 26:48.322
Anything that keeps me down here

26:48.927 --> 26:50.925
is better than...

26:51.345 --> 26:55.459
(crying) I'd let him hit me 1,000 times,

26:55.527 --> 26:57.865
as long as I don't have
to go upstairs again.

26:57.933 --> 26:59.934
(sobbing)

27:03.705 --> 27:05.210
(Weller) This is insane.

27:05.278 --> 27:06.948
There are over 40,000 people in this area.

27:07.016 --> 27:08.787
It's gonna take us days to search.

27:08.855 --> 27:10.562
We don't have that kind of time.

27:10.630 --> 27:12.314
She could be out of the country by then.

27:12.382 --> 27:14.790
Patterson... what is this here

27:14.858 --> 27:15.744
on the dashboard?

27:15.812 --> 27:17.340
It's a key card. I know.

27:17.408 --> 27:20.038
I traced it to Invidia Security Systems.

27:20.106 --> 27:22.308
The card is a pass for a
type of gate that they make.

27:22.376 --> 27:25.215
But I checked every port
of transit in the area.

27:25.283 --> 27:27.921
None of them use Invidia Security.

27:28.080 --> 27:31.625
What if they're not trafficking
out the women at all?

27:31.693 --> 27:32.325
What do you mean?

27:32.393 --> 27:34.561
What if they're being kept somewhere?

27:34.629 --> 27:35.788
All together?

27:35.902 --> 27:37.521
Like a brothel?

27:37.589 --> 27:40.054
That would mean that we shouldn't be
looking for an escape method at all.

27:40.122 --> 27:41.509
We should be looking for a hiding place.

27:41.632 --> 27:42.843
Right.

27:42.911 --> 27:46.149
Okay, does Invidia have
any gates in the radius?

27:47.537 --> 27:50.142
Ah, okay. No current properties.

27:50.258 --> 27:52.126
But there was an old gated community

27:52.194 --> 27:53.587
that was purchased by developers

27:53.655 --> 27:55.756
in 2008 that employed them.

27:55.824 --> 27:57.167
Looks like the project's been in limbo

27:57.235 --> 27:58.964
since the economy crashed,

27:59.032 --> 28:01.820
<i>but all the houses are
still there unoccupied.</i>

28:01.922 --> 28:03.890
All right, give us the address.

28:08.503 --> 28:09.804
(footfalls)

28:09.964 --> 28:11.427
No one likes a tattletale.

28:11.495 --> 28:12.918
I didn't tell Camila, I swear.

28:12.986 --> 28:14.442
- This time, I won't leave a mark.
- I swear!

28:14.509 --> 28:16.588
Please don't! No! Please stop!

28:16.656 --> 28:18.746
(overlapping shouting)

28:18.814 --> 28:20.014
(grunting)

28:22.683 --> 28:26.300
(gasping)

28:26.392 --> 28:29.060
(grunting)

28:35.182 --> 28:37.284
(groaning)

28:39.903 --> 28:41.003
(screaming)

28:43.766 --> 28:46.401
(man) What's going on down there? Hey!

28:47.042 --> 28:49.188
Stop! Don't you move!

28:55.571 --> 28:58.617
Anyone besides me even read her file?

29:00.484 --> 29:03.023
Does this even look like
the same girl to you?

29:04.785 --> 29:06.014
Who are you?

29:06.135 --> 29:08.637
You with the feds? Huh?

29:08.860 --> 29:12.330
Hm? Huh?

29:17.753 --> 29:21.756
(laughing)

29:22.790 --> 29:25.468
She's been here for an hour already.

29:25.591 --> 29:28.793
Whoever she's working
with won't be far behind.

29:35.040 --> 29:37.575
(footfalls)

29:39.598 --> 29:40.509
Gentlemen!

29:40.577 --> 29:43.253
My apologies, but we're gonna
have to cut this night short.

29:43.321 --> 29:45.506
But rest assured, I will make it up

29:45.574 --> 29:48.743
to each and every one of you in spades.

29:51.017 --> 29:54.540
Sir, we have to get you out of here now.

29:54.659 --> 29:56.853
This place is covered in evidence.

29:56.975 --> 29:59.943
I can't risk leaving
anything that'll tie me to it.

30:00.813 --> 30:02.647
Burn it to the ground.

30:02.871 --> 30:04.438
What should I do with them?

30:04.639 --> 30:07.607
I can't risk leaving any evidence.

30:08.703 --> 30:11.772
(overlapping chatter)

30:26.249 --> 30:28.083
We might need her.

30:53.453 --> 30:54.386
(gunfire)

30:54.579 --> 30:55.512
(groaning)

30:55.975 --> 30:59.110
(overlapping chatter)

31:15.163 --> 31:18.632
(Zapata speaking in Spanish)

31:34.188 --> 31:37.056
(women coughing)

31:47.962 --> 31:48.866
(gunfire continues)

31:48.936 --> 31:50.617
Weller, I'm going in after her!

31:50.685 --> 31:53.512
Stay here, Reade! We
gotta take 'em down first!

32:12.049 --> 32:13.349
(Zapata) Go, go, go!

32:13.439 --> 32:16.574
(women shouting)

32:16.744 --> 32:17.644
(explosion)

32:17.728 --> 32:20.863
(woman screaming)

32:22.831 --> 32:25.800
(coughing)

32:29.854 --> 32:31.688
(screaming)

32:32.037 --> 32:33.601
Help!

32:33.669 --> 32:35.636
(gunfire continuing)

32:36.041 --> 32:37.175
Go!

32:42.360 --> 32:43.493
(groaning)

32:44.940 --> 32:46.931
Hey, let me drive away.

32:46.999 --> 32:48.336
- Drop that gun!
- Or I kill her!

32:48.404 --> 32:49.473
Drop that gun now!

32:49.541 --> 32:51.509
Let me drive aw... (screaming)

32:52.609 --> 32:54.595
- (screaming)
- Don't move.

32:54.663 --> 32:57.060
- Don't move.
- There's a girl trapped in there,

32:57.128 --> 32:58.416
in the basement! You have to help her!

32:58.484 --> 33:00.276
She saved us! She saved us!

33:00.344 --> 33:01.711
Weller, that's Zapata!

33:08.318 --> 33:10.920
(Zapata screaming and
banging on door) I'm here!

33:11.010 --> 33:12.377
Come here, Reade.

33:13.377 --> 33:16.242
(Reade) Tasha! Tasha!

33:16.883 --> 33:18.780
(grunting) Drop it, drop it!

33:18.848 --> 33:19.501
(clanging)

33:19.569 --> 33:21.370
Tasha!

33:21.968 --> 33:23.110
(banging)

33:23.178 --> 33:24.812
(coughing)

33:27.325 --> 33:29.727
We gotta get her out before
the fire hits the gas line!

33:29.795 --> 33:30.528
Come on.

33:30.596 --> 33:32.230
(banging and shouting)

33:35.337 --> 33:36.072
Go!

33:36.140 --> 33:38.105
Tasha. Tasha.

33:38.647 --> 33:42.317
Go! Go! Go, go, go! Reade, go!

33:42.385 --> 33:45.754
Go! Come on! Go! Go!

33:45.822 --> 33:48.958
(coughing)

33:50.403 --> 33:52.904
(explosion)

34:01.897 --> 34:04.749
(Zapata) This woman was taken
around the same time as you.

34:06.319 --> 34:08.120
Do you recognize her?

34:18.533 --> 34:21.867
Camila, what happened to her?

34:22.684 --> 34:25.621
A client killed her at a party.

34:25.690 --> 34:28.601
He said it was an accident.

34:29.710 --> 34:34.036
And Max... he forced me
to get rid of her body.

34:35.715 --> 34:38.884
(sobbing) She was my friend.

34:42.649 --> 34:47.960
After that, Max began to
call me his special helper.

34:48.542 --> 34:51.597
He said I was different
from the other girls.

34:55.737 --> 34:59.813
Maxwell Tate is facing
charges on over 100 counts

34:59.881 --> 35:03.008
ranging from bribery to sex trafficking

35:03.076 --> 35:05.355
to first-degree sexual assault.

35:05.423 --> 35:07.599
He'll spend the rest
of his life behind bars.

35:07.667 --> 35:09.514
As will the client who killed Paloma...

35:09.582 --> 35:11.083
a two-term state senator.

35:11.150 --> 35:12.918
And that's just the
beginning. We're going after

35:12.986 --> 35:15.045
every last one of his clients.

35:15.113 --> 35:16.822
"Some rise by sin."

35:17.205 --> 35:20.957
In light of the new evidence
and Camila's eyewitness account,

35:21.025 --> 35:24.633
Ronnie Vargas' execution has been stayed.

35:24.701 --> 35:28.200
He's expected to be released
from prison within the week.

35:28.344 --> 35:30.579
Nice work, everyone.

35:35.365 --> 35:36.942
Hey.

35:38.131 --> 35:40.915
I just wanted to see
how you were holding up.

35:41.344 --> 35:44.683
That was a... pretty brutal mission.

35:47.049 --> 35:48.983
Those women today...

35:51.879 --> 35:53.950
No one else was coming for them.

35:54.018 --> 35:55.836
If it hadn't been for us

35:55.904 --> 35:58.830
and for your tattoos, there's a good chance

35:58.898 --> 36:01.266
they wouldn't have been found at all.

36:01.735 --> 36:04.653
Anything I had to do would have
been worth it to take down Tate.

36:06.809 --> 36:08.595
You really feel that way?

36:08.663 --> 36:10.684
This work is bigger than us.

36:16.616 --> 36:19.255
I take it this is about
your other assignment.

36:19.323 --> 36:20.747
I've been looking into
Carter's disappearance,

36:20.815 --> 36:22.950
and I can't find any
evidence as to where he was

36:23.018 --> 36:25.283
in the hours before his car
showed up on that bridge,

36:25.351 --> 36:27.967
but there's a bunch of
traffic cameras near it.

36:28.035 --> 36:29.933
I figured if I drive up, take a look...

36:30.001 --> 36:31.496
You might be able to track where his car

36:31.564 --> 36:33.088
- was coming from that night.
- Right.

36:33.156 --> 36:34.527
All the cameras feed into the D.O.T.

36:34.595 --> 36:36.554
Traffic Management Center
in Long Island City.

36:36.622 --> 36:38.325
I just need a warrant to
take a look at the footage.

36:38.393 --> 36:42.107
I'll make a call. You find anything,

36:42.175 --> 36:44.594
you bring it to me and only me.

36:44.679 --> 36:46.107
Yes, ma'am.

37:00.386 --> 37:01.660
There you are.

37:02.020 --> 37:04.939
In the flesh... mostly.

37:05.712 --> 37:06.588
Feeling better?

37:06.656 --> 37:08.916
Yeah, I'm... I'm okay.

37:10.837 --> 37:12.737
I missed you today.

37:12.938 --> 37:15.406
I missed being out with the team.

37:15.667 --> 37:17.797
The team missed you too.

37:18.037 --> 37:19.834
You're one of us now.

37:26.137 --> 37:27.786
Are you coming?

37:27.908 --> 37:30.176
No. Going down.

37:47.188 --> 37:48.455
Come on!

37:51.947 --> 37:53.562
Get in the car.

37:59.365 --> 38:01.199
Good work, guys.

38:04.032 --> 38:08.259
Something the U.S. Marshals
can help you with, Agent Weller?

38:08.332 --> 38:09.801
Well...

38:09.890 --> 38:12.092
I know you don't like football.

38:12.793 --> 38:14.604
Do you like basketball?

38:14.672 --> 38:15.767
Not really, no.

38:15.835 --> 38:19.604
That's good, 'cause the game's almost over.

38:19.672 --> 38:21.439
How were the seats?

38:21.768 --> 38:25.510
Garbage. At least, the beer's overpriced.

38:25.578 --> 38:27.179
What's the deal with you and Jane?

38:27.246 --> 38:29.866
I mean, that's why you were
acting weird this morning, right?

38:29.934 --> 38:32.317
I mean, I'm not asking
for some big commitment,

38:32.385 --> 38:34.849
but I don't wanna play proxy to the woman

38:34.917 --> 38:36.217
you really wanna be sleeping with.

38:36.285 --> 38:37.585
No.

38:37.870 --> 38:40.538
That is not what this is about.

38:40.748 --> 38:42.103
Okay?

38:42.328 --> 38:44.381
I wanna take you to the game

38:44.537 --> 38:47.499
and drink some overpriced beers.

38:47.567 --> 38:50.502
And then, maybe we can end
up back in your apartment

38:50.570 --> 38:53.805
where... we trash another room?

38:53.873 --> 38:56.102
- (laughing)
- Huh?

39:00.877 --> 39:02.953
Oh, those seats really are garbage.

39:03.021 --> 39:04.326
Yeah, I told you.

39:04.394 --> 39:05.433
Come on, I'm down here.

39:05.501 --> 39:06.960
What, so I win?

39:07.028 --> 39:09.872
- You win.
- Ha ha!

39:14.957 --> 39:17.576
That was the last of 'em.

39:17.693 --> 39:19.197
He avoided every traffic camera?

39:19.265 --> 39:20.879
How is that even possible?

39:20.947 --> 39:24.002
Look, man, cams don't cover the whole city.

39:24.070 --> 39:26.104
Locations are public.

39:26.172 --> 39:27.913
Someone wants to stay off 'em bad enough,

39:27.981 --> 39:29.541
they could just...

39:32.229 --> 39:33.955
- What?
- (typing) Hang on.

39:34.023 --> 39:36.366
They've been testing new ones recently.

39:36.434 --> 39:38.995
Wouldn't be listed anywhere yet.

39:40.467 --> 39:42.705
(typing)

39:48.349 --> 39:49.477
(Reade) Stop it here.

39:49.565 --> 39:51.241
All right, back it up.

39:52.303 --> 39:53.965
There, there, right there.

39:54.134 --> 39:56.225
That's the guy you're looking for?

39:57.432 --> 39:58.780
No.

40:00.088 --> 40:01.973
But that's his car.

40:02.149 --> 40:04.362
So, who the hell are you?

40:07.782 --> 40:10.566
_

40:14.873 --> 40:16.074
- (sharp crack)
- (groaning)

40:27.301 --> 40:29.080
That email to Patterson...

40:29.235 --> 40:31.916
Help from a friend? That was you?

40:31.984 --> 40:35.706
I told you it was
important, but you refused,

40:35.774 --> 40:38.749
so we had to resort to other measures.

40:38.817 --> 40:41.150
Much riskier measures, by the way.

40:41.218 --> 40:43.064
Why?

40:43.132 --> 40:45.016
Why this case? Why is it worth the risk?

40:45.084 --> 40:47.285
Because we were out of time.

40:47.407 --> 40:50.320
An innocent man was going to die.

40:50.388 --> 40:52.832
So... does this mean

40:52.900 --> 40:55.447
you've changed your mind
about working with me?

40:55.597 --> 40:56.946
No.

40:58.423 --> 41:01.043
This is the last time we'll be meeting.

41:01.610 --> 41:03.417
I don't trust you.

41:03.757 --> 41:07.467
And whoever I was before,
I don't trust her either.

41:08.834 --> 41:12.741
I'm not your asset inside the FBI anymore.

41:13.687 --> 41:16.055
I <i>am</i> FBI.

41:16.153 --> 41:20.346
Taylor, you're in deep with these people.

41:20.593 --> 41:22.106
You can't see the big picture right now.

41:22.174 --> 41:25.997
When you could, I swear,
you felt very differently.

41:26.840 --> 41:28.289
You decided to infiltrate them.

41:28.357 --> 41:29.853
Stop!

41:29.985 --> 41:31.449
I don't care.

41:31.544 --> 41:32.902
I am not that person anymore.

41:32.970 --> 41:36.527
I am not the person
who planned all of this.

41:36.595 --> 41:41.299
I am not your fiancée,
and I'm not on your side.

41:41.974 --> 41:45.158
Well, I'm still on your side,

41:45.256 --> 41:47.592
and I want to protect you.

41:48.316 --> 41:51.918
And if I can, I wanna protect
the people you care about too.

41:51.987 --> 41:54.843
But I'm the good cop, and the bad cops,

41:54.954 --> 41:56.869
they're not so concerned about that part.

41:56.937 --> 41:58.528
What, bad cops?

41:58.596 --> 42:00.702
You left very strict instructions...

42:00.826 --> 42:04.510
the possibility that you'd
be an unwilling participant

42:04.578 --> 42:07.211
with something you've accounted for.

42:07.713 --> 42:11.222
The people we work with,
they'll stop at nothing

42:11.290 --> 42:13.874
to make sure this plan succeeds.

42:13.942 --> 42:15.573
What are you saying?

42:15.641 --> 42:18.341
If you refuse to cooperate...

42:19.866 --> 42:22.534
they'll kill Agent Weller.
