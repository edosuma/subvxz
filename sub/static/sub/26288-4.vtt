Your plane just touched down.

06:38.789 --> 06:40.922

06:40.965 --> 06:43.968

06:49.060 --> 06:51.585
it was not with the help

Got something.

07:30.754 --> 07:34.105
Hey. I got blood.

07:38.545 --> 07:40.938
And torn fabric.

07:51.296 --> 07:53.821
Looks like a piece
of our robber.

07:53.864 --> 07:56.606
Where's the rest of him?

08:05.223 --> 08:07.399
KASIE:
Since records began in 1947,

08:07.443 --> 08:10.968
there have been over a hundred
documented wheel well stowaways.

08:11.012 --> 08:12.535
Hmm. So it's actually possible.

08:12.579 --> 08:14.102
Oh, more than possible.

08:14.145 --> 08:16.452
I mean, especially
on a plane this size.

08:16.496 --> 08:19.281
The nose well of the Hercules
is comparatively roomy.

08:19.324 --> 08:22.327
No peanuts or oxygen.

08:22.371 --> 08:23.415
I didn't say it was safe.

08:23.459 --> 08:25.330
Well, our guy did
lose a finger.

08:25.374 --> 08:28.029
Must have pinched after takeoff.Ouch.

08:28.072 --> 08:30.597
But survivable.
Uh, well...

08:30.640 --> 08:32.294
finger folly aside,

08:32.337 --> 08:33.904
three out of four
wheel well stowaways

08:33.948 --> 08:36.516
die in midair,
either due to lack of oxygen

08:36.559 --> 08:38.039
or the extreme cold.

08:38.082 --> 08:40.955
Temperatures at altitude
can drop to negative 40.

08:40.998 --> 08:43.958
Oof. Bad way to travel.

08:44.001 --> 08:45.568
Kind of like a unicycle.

08:45.612 --> 08:48.571
Unless you've got
cold-weather gear,

08:48.615 --> 08:50.486
an oxygen tank and a parachute.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.358
Yeah, sure. Then a wheel well
is a pretty ingenious way

08:53.402 --> 08:55.447
to disappear to South
America without a trail.

08:55.491 --> 08:57.058
Very Jason Bourne.

08:57.101 --> 08:58.668
Till the plane was diverted.

08:58.712 --> 09:00.627
Which leaves us
with two options.

09:00.670 --> 09:02.846
Either our guy fell out
with no parachute,

09:02.890 --> 09:04.718
and we're looking for
a dead pancake...

09:04.761 --> 09:08.286
Or he jumped and is
still alive... somewhere.

09:08.330 --> 09:10.027
I'm still working on that.

09:10.071 --> 09:11.289
So, what about an I.D.?

09:11.333 --> 09:12.595
Or are you just searching
for Matt Damon?

09:12.639 --> 09:14.815
Police never got a good
look at the robber,

09:14.858 --> 09:16.338
and the car was stolen.

09:16.381 --> 09:17.861
Fingerprints.

09:17.905 --> 09:19.341
They didn't find any.

09:19.384 --> 09:20.472
Yeah, no, but we did.

09:22.344 --> 09:23.693
The severed finger, right.

09:23.737 --> 09:26.087
Uh, it's down
in Autopsy, thawing.

09:27.871 --> 09:30.091
The Fishlord 2000
came out two years ago,

09:30.134 --> 09:31.962
but it didn't have
GPS capabilities

09:32.006 --> 09:33.616
or social media
app support.

09:33.660 --> 09:34.965
This model does.

09:35.009 --> 09:38.534
Because this is
the Fishlord 3000.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.362
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Let's reel 'em in!

09:40.405 --> 09:43.191
Spared no expense.

09:43.234 --> 09:44.540
Why?

09:44.584 --> 09:47.108
For Gibbs and me
to use on the lake.
No.

09:47.151 --> 09:48.500
Why are you two friends?

09:48.544 --> 09:50.285
I said. He helped
build my boat.

09:50.328 --> 09:52.374
No, I got that.
It's the stuff about Twitter

09:52.417 --> 09:55.725
and expensive fish finders
where I get lost.

09:55.769 --> 09:58.075
Have you met Gibbs?
He's a troglodyte.

09:58.119 --> 09:59.294
No offense.

09:59.337 --> 10:01.513
Too late.

10:01.557 --> 10:03.472
What are these for?Keys to my house.

10:03.515 --> 10:04.473
Knock yourselves out.

10:04.516 --> 10:06.083
You want us to stay there?

10:06.127 --> 10:08.346
You're not staying here.

10:09.739 --> 10:11.349
Well...

10:11.393 --> 10:13.134
it was good to meet you, Fred.

10:13.177 --> 10:15.092
It's Phil.

10:15.136 --> 10:16.616
And he was talking
to both of us.

10:16.659 --> 10:17.965
No, he wasn't.
I know the man.

10:18.008 --> 10:19.488
So do I. Gibbs and I
have shared a lot.

10:19.531 --> 10:21.446
Have you shared an ex

10:21.490 --> 10:22.796
No.

10:22.839 --> 10:24.536
Is that a brag?

10:24.580 --> 10:26.930
I'm just saying that
I know the man intimately.

10:26.974 --> 10:28.715
Oh, wait.

10:28.758 --> 10:31.152
You're jealous.

10:31.195 --> 10:32.544
What?!Yeah.

10:32.588 --> 10:33.371
No!

10:33.415 --> 10:34.895
Yes.It's just

10:34.938 --> 10:36.505
that if you were really friends,
you'd know

10:36.548 --> 10:40.117
that Gibbs hates electronics
in the cabin.

10:40.161 --> 10:41.902
Especially hunting aids.

10:41.945 --> 10:43.599
And don't get me started
on phones.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.340
But it's my first time up here.

10:45.383 --> 10:46.820
Exactly.

10:46.863 --> 10:48.996
So why don't you sit
this one out, Skippy?

10:49.039 --> 10:51.346
Well, you got a car.
I'm stuck here.

10:51.389 --> 10:54.349
I will call you a taxi.

10:54.392 --> 10:56.699
Signal is always
a little bit spotty here.

10:59.484 --> 11:01.835
No. No, no, no, no. No.

11:01.878 --> 11:03.619
That wasn't
for pleasure, Gibbs.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.403
That was an emergency!

11:05.447 --> 11:06.666
You were right.

11:06.709 --> 11:08.493
He does hate
electronics

11:08.537 --> 11:10.278
at the cabin.

11:10.321 --> 11:11.671
He's pretty mad at you.

11:13.542 --> 11:16.545
Sir, by 7:10 we were
climbing to 30,000 feet

11:16.588 --> 11:19.026
at a little over
300 miles an hour.

11:19.069 --> 11:21.245
Still with nothing to report.

11:21.289 --> 11:23.552
Lieutenant Holcomb, you had
an unauthorized passenger

11:23.595 --> 11:25.510
on that plane, your plane,

11:25.554 --> 11:27.469
and we're trying to figure out
how he got there.

11:27.512 --> 11:30.515
Then stop accusing me
and my crew of being involved!

11:35.782 --> 11:38.393
You notice anything unusual
this morning?Nope.

11:38.436 --> 11:41.875
We make that flight every month,
like clockwork.

11:41.918 --> 11:42.919
Hello?

11:42.963 --> 11:44.268
Your ground crew.

11:44.312 --> 11:45.487
They might have seen something.

11:45.530 --> 11:47.532
Everyone on that tarmac
has a job to do.

11:47.576 --> 11:50.535
Looking for stowaways
isn't one of them.

11:50.579 --> 11:53.451
I mean, who the hell
would be that stupid?

11:53.495 --> 11:55.279
I think we're about to find out.

11:55.323 --> 11:56.716
On my way back, Jimmy.

11:58.543 --> 12:01.503
Nail pitting can be
a sign of psoriasis

12:01.546 --> 12:03.984
or inflammatory arthritis.

12:04.027 --> 12:08.858
Uh, no doubt the tropical
South American climate

12:08.902 --> 12:10.860
would ease the pain.

12:10.904 --> 12:13.254
What, you think this guy risked
his life for better skin?

12:13.297 --> 12:16.083
Vitamin supplements
are much safer.

12:16.126 --> 12:17.606
Jimmy, you said you had a print?

12:17.649 --> 12:19.956
Just one sec. Almost done.
Uh, Dr. Mallard,

12:20.000 --> 12:21.958
would you start for me?Gladly.

12:22.002 --> 12:24.526
This is the
right index finger

12:24.569 --> 12:26.441
of a fully grown
adult male.

12:26.484 --> 12:28.617
After thawing the digit,

12:28.660 --> 12:30.575
and separating fabric
from flesh,

12:30.619 --> 12:34.492
Dr. Palmer rehydrated the tissue
with injections

12:34.536 --> 12:36.625
of saline.

12:36.668 --> 12:39.410
It's a common procedure. It's
outlined in Dr. Mallard's book.

12:39.454 --> 12:42.413
Volume one comes out next week.

12:42.457 --> 12:44.415
Oh, that's right.
Congrats, Duck.

12:44.459 --> 12:45.895
JIMMY:
It's exciting, huh?

12:45.939 --> 12:47.679
They even asked him
to go on a signing tour.

12:47.723 --> 12:48.637
DUCKY:
It's only being sold

12:48.680 --> 12:50.291
at lesser colleges

12:50.334 --> 12:53.120
with a specialized
medical examiner program.

12:53.163 --> 12:55.122
I politely declined.

12:55.165 --> 12:58.821
But I am scheduling
all of his flights.

12:58.865 --> 13:00.910
Jimmy, I thought you were
working on the fingerprint.

13:00.954 --> 13:04.087
Yeah, it's on the list. Right
now, I am sending Dr. Mallard

13:04.131 --> 13:05.959
on the trip of a lifetime.

13:06.002 --> 13:10.093
It is six weeks worth of
dramatic readings, autographs.

13:10.137 --> 13:11.747
Here's the itinerary.

13:13.749 --> 13:15.664
Tell him he should go.

13:15.707 --> 13:17.579
What

13:17.622 --> 13:21.539
You know, Duck, I loved doing
my book tours for Deep Six.

13:21.583 --> 13:22.540
People really love

13:22.584 --> 13:24.412
putting a face
to the words.

13:24.455 --> 13:26.109
Especially the groupies.

13:26.153 --> 13:29.373
Define "groupies."

13:29.417 --> 13:32.333
Eager, attractive fans
of your work.

13:32.376 --> 13:34.988
Well, upper New York State

13:35.031 --> 13:37.904
is at its best
this time of the year.

13:37.947 --> 13:40.254
Yes, perhaps I should

13:40.297 --> 13:42.212
talk this over with my agent.

13:42.256 --> 13:43.735
Where's my phone?

13:43.779 --> 13:45.781
Ah.

13:47.739 --> 13:49.219
Uh, excuse me.

13:53.658 --> 13:56.705
Dr. Mallard stayed to help after
the director was kidnapped.

13:56.748 --> 13:59.360
But really, he's just been
wandering around,

13:59.403 --> 14:01.753
uh, constantly looking
over my shoulder.

14:01.797 --> 14:04.539
Is it wrong for me to help him
find a new project?

14:04.582 --> 14:06.062
Jimmy, fingerprint.

14:06.106 --> 14:08.325
Oh, I already
sent it up to Kasie.

14:08.369 --> 14:10.675
What

14:10.719 --> 14:13.722
: Uh, I needed
your help with Dr. Mallard.

14:13.765 --> 14:15.158
Gibbs would murder you.

14:15.202 --> 14:16.464
I know.

14:16.507 --> 14:18.161
You are so much nicer.

14:19.467 --> 14:22.600
BISHOP: Robber's stolen car
arrives at 6:39 a.m.

14:22.644 --> 14:24.864
He parks and waits.Got tinted windows.

14:24.907 --> 14:26.213
You can't see a face.

14:27.431 --> 14:30.826
BISHOP: The armored truck
arrives at 6:53.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.132
TORRES:
You got one guard.

14:32.175 --> 14:33.394
BISHOP:
A payday loan shop in the middle

14:33.437 --> 14:36.658
of Nowhere, Carolina
is not a high priority.

14:36.701 --> 14:38.703
TORRES:
It will be now.

14:40.488 --> 14:42.229
Wow.

14:42.272 --> 14:45.406
350 grand in four
and a half seconds.

14:45.449 --> 14:46.494
That's not bad.

14:46.537 --> 14:47.930
BISHOP: He knew
the delivery schedule

14:47.974 --> 14:49.366
and he was careful.

14:49.410 --> 14:51.368
TORRES:
That flight suit

14:51.412 --> 14:53.240
helped him blend in on the base.

14:53.283 --> 14:54.415
Could this guy be military?

14:54.458 --> 14:56.678
We need a name
to match that finger.

14:56.721 --> 14:58.506
It's been classified.

14:58.549 --> 14:59.899
By who?

14:59.942 --> 15:02.727
The FBI. We got an exact match
in the system,

15:02.771 --> 15:05.861
but to access the file, we have
to be read in, in person.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.516
The FBI is coming here?Yeah.

15:08.559 --> 15:09.517
KASIE: Turn
those frowns

15:09.560 --> 15:10.344
upside down.

15:10.387 --> 15:11.954
You got fingerprint info?

15:11.998 --> 15:17.394
Oh, no. That is not the reason
for the smiles.

15:17.438 --> 15:19.092
I found our robber.
I mean, kind of,

15:19.135 --> 15:20.571
kind of-- the
general area.

15:20.615 --> 15:23.879
Okay. According
to the black box recorder,

15:23.923 --> 15:25.925
the landing gear only extended
on approach to D.C.

15:25.968 --> 15:29.537
The robber could have parachuted
anytime before landing.

15:29.580 --> 15:31.582
That's 60 miles
of north-south approach

15:31.626 --> 15:33.410
with about three miles
of east-west drift

15:33.454 --> 15:35.108
for a parachute descent.

15:35.151 --> 15:37.110
Needle, meet haystack.

15:37.153 --> 15:39.503
Yes. But since no one reported

15:39.547 --> 15:41.723
a random parachute
on their morning commute,

15:41.766 --> 15:44.421
and there was
nothing on social media...

15:44.465 --> 15:46.380
Our robber avoided
populated areas.

15:46.423 --> 15:48.425
Which would mean
he jumped as soon

15:48.469 --> 15:50.166
as the landing gear
doors opened.

15:50.210 --> 15:53.387
Which would put him
somewhere around here.

15:53.430 --> 15:55.606
BISHOP: Well, okay,
slightly smaller haystack.

15:55.650 --> 15:57.347
TORRES:
You mean forest.

15:57.391 --> 15:59.480
Yeah, and still too big
to cover on foot.

15:59.523 --> 16:01.569
But we can alert park rangers
and set up roadblocks.

16:01.612 --> 16:03.005
Right, McGee?

16:03.049 --> 16:05.529
These road names,
they-they look familiar.

16:05.573 --> 16:07.096
Wait, is this Brossard County?

16:07.140 --> 16:09.577
Yes.No.

16:09.620 --> 16:12.232
What

16:12.275 --> 16:14.016
Gibbs, and his cabin.

16:14.060 --> 16:15.670
Oh.

16:15.713 --> 16:17.063
Ooh.

16:17.106 --> 16:19.108
Yeah, but you said the
search grid is-is huge.

16:19.152 --> 16:20.370
Yeah, but we should
still warn him.

16:20.414 --> 16:22.068
We're gonna interrupt
his vacation?

16:22.111 --> 16:24.113
No, man. He doesn't
want to talk to us.

16:27.551 --> 16:29.814
Special Agent McGee.

16:29.858 --> 16:32.513
Hey, boss, uh,

16:32.556 --> 16:34.515
we were just talking about you.

16:35.995 --> 16:40.477
Damn. That's just...
that's next level.

16:40.521 --> 16:42.523
You're going out to search
for a missing bank robber

16:42.566 --> 16:43.828
in the middle of nowhere?

16:43.872 --> 16:46.527
You used my phone
to call NCIS?

16:46.570 --> 16:49.095
Hey. That was an emergency.

16:49.138 --> 16:50.531
You were looking for an
excuse to get out of here.

16:50.574 --> 16:52.228
Gibbs, the chances of you
finding this guy

16:52.272 --> 16:53.490
are a million to one.

16:53.534 --> 16:55.362
So you're just
gonna leave us?

16:55.405 --> 16:57.799
Yes.

17:00.236 --> 17:02.760
Well, I was an Eagle Scout.

17:02.804 --> 17:05.415
I was a trained
federal agent.

17:05.459 --> 17:07.374
Hmm.

17:09.985 --> 17:11.726
Ooh.Ooh. Ah.

17:11.769 --> 17:12.988
Gibbs!Wait Up!

17:13.032 --> 17:14.294
Hey, Gibbs!

17:22.171 --> 17:23.564
All right, so where are we?

17:23.607 --> 17:25.479
Well, Gibbs happily volunteered

17:25.522 --> 17:28.438
to search miles
of remote forest.

17:28.482 --> 17:30.266
Said he needed the distraction.

17:30.310 --> 17:32.312
From his vacation?

17:32.355 --> 17:34.662
Roadblocks?State Police have been notified,

17:34.705 --> 17:36.185
but are you sure
he didn't want to wait

17:36.229 --> 17:37.578
for the Forestry Service?

17:37.621 --> 17:40.537
Gibbs is Gibbs.
Did you talk to the NSA?

17:40.581 --> 17:43.671
Yeah. Thermal-imaging satellites
won't be in place for hours.

17:45.716 --> 17:48.197
Sorry, Suze.
Forgot to turn it off.

17:48.241 --> 17:49.633
Uh-oh.

17:49.677 --> 17:51.200
You think the FBI knows
that this case deals

17:51.244 --> 17:53.463
with stolen federal money,
and crosses state lines?

17:53.507 --> 17:55.378
Safe bet.

17:55.422 --> 17:57.250
They're gonna take over.

17:57.293 --> 17:59.078
Well, don't let them.

17:59.121 --> 18:00.427
Do what Gibbs does.

18:00.470 --> 18:01.689
Such as?

18:01.732 --> 18:05.562
For starters,
stop being so nice.

18:15.703 --> 18:17.444
I win!

18:17.487 --> 18:18.793
I made it to the top
of the ridge first.

18:18.836 --> 18:20.403
Phil wasn't even close.

18:20.447 --> 18:23.493
You see anything?

18:23.537 --> 18:25.060
I know what you're doing.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.410
Using us against each other
for your own benefit.

18:27.454 --> 18:29.630
Did you see anything?

18:29.673 --> 18:31.588
You were right.

18:31.632 --> 18:33.808
You can see the whole
valley from up there.

18:33.851 --> 18:36.506
I saw some fabric caught
in a tree

18:36.550 --> 18:38.160
a couple of miles due east.

18:38.204 --> 18:40.249
It's got to be the
parachute, right?

18:40.293 --> 18:43.165
Hey. What took you
so long, Pokey?

18:43.209 --> 18:44.949
I'm built for comfort,
not speed.

18:44.993 --> 18:46.690
He told you
about the parachute?

18:46.734 --> 18:48.214
Yeah.

18:48.257 --> 18:51.695
Guess this thing finds
fish, not bad guys.

18:51.739 --> 18:54.829
Hey, put that back. We may need
it if I run out of protein bars.

18:54.872 --> 18:56.439
Come on, let's get out of here.

18:56.483 --> 18:58.354
Does it keep score

18:58.398 --> 18:59.747
Me, one;
you, zero.

18:59.790 --> 19:01.662
Oh, very funny. Give it back.

19:01.705 --> 19:03.229
You want a tip,
Agent Monet?

19:03.272 --> 19:06.580
Call me Izzy. And, yes, please.

19:06.623 --> 19:08.234
Izzy.Mm?

19:08.277 --> 19:09.539
Take a bus tour.

19:09.583 --> 19:11.193
Like a tourist?

19:11.237 --> 19:12.760
Yeah, the cheesier the better.

19:12.803 --> 19:15.589
You'll see all the landmarks,
and then you're gonna learn

19:15.632 --> 19:18.026
how to use those to,
uh, to navigate.

19:18.069 --> 19:21.682
Smart. I'd rather have
someone show me around.

19:22.683 --> 19:24.337
Do you know anybody?

19:24.380 --> 19:27.296
Well, Izzy, that depends.

19:28.384 --> 19:30.081
Do you like motorcycles?

19:30.125 --> 19:33.737
Hello. Special Agent
Timothy McGee, NCIS.

19:33.781 --> 19:35.609
Isabel Monet, FBI.

19:35.652 --> 19:36.784
This is our case.

19:36.827 --> 19:38.699
Wow, you were not kidding.

19:40.222 --> 19:42.355
I'm not here
to take over the case.

19:42.398 --> 19:43.704
You told her?

19:43.747 --> 19:46.228
She has a nice smile.

19:46.272 --> 19:48.665
I just recently transferred
from our San Diego office.

19:48.709 --> 19:51.842
I'm not used to people being
so uptight about jurisdiction.

19:53.235 --> 19:55.237
Or life, in general.

19:55.281 --> 19:56.630
Well, you'll get there.

19:56.673 --> 19:58.588
Hmm.Now, about our
fingerprint match?

19:58.632 --> 20:00.416
Down to business.

20:00.460 --> 20:01.896
That is so East Coast.

20:01.939 --> 20:03.463
Meet Franklin Poe.

20:03.506 --> 20:05.726
You were not able
to access his info

20:05.769 --> 20:08.294
because he's part of the Federal
Witness Protection Program.

20:08.337 --> 20:11.035
Is he a scared bunny
or a dirty rat?

20:11.079 --> 20:12.385
Poe's a rat.

20:12.428 --> 20:13.908
He was busted three years ago

20:13.951 --> 20:17.651
as part of a high-profile heist
in Las Vegas.

20:17.694 --> 20:19.827
Agreed to testify against
his buddies for a plea deal.

20:19.870 --> 20:21.611
Hence witness protection.

20:21.655 --> 20:24.310
We set him up in North Carolina
managing a shoe store.

20:24.353 --> 20:26.790
It's not sexy, but safe.

20:26.834 --> 20:28.705
I guess he had second thoughts.

20:28.749 --> 20:32.231
Waves break,
but they don't change course.

20:32.274 --> 20:33.667
Do you surf?

20:33.710 --> 20:35.277
It's funny you should ask that.

20:35.321 --> 20:36.583
I...
Is this it?

20:36.626 --> 20:38.280
Am I missing something?

20:38.324 --> 20:40.456
No. It just seems
that you could've told us this

20:40.500 --> 20:42.763
over the phone,
or maybe e-mailed the file.

20:42.806 --> 20:45.592
You got me. Uh, there's actually
another reason

20:45.635 --> 20:47.333
that I came in person.

20:47.376 --> 20:49.987
I, um, I...Izzy?

20:50.031 --> 20:51.598
Jackie-Jack!

20:53.469 --> 20:54.905
There's my little beach bum.

20:54.949 --> 20:57.734
3,000 miles,
and trouble still finds me.

20:57.778 --> 20:58.779
How about that?

20:58.822 --> 21:01.434
It's nice to see you, too.

21:02.783 --> 21:04.698
Uh-huh.

21:08.354 --> 21:10.617
Slow down, Bear Grylls!

21:10.660 --> 21:11.922
Who's Pokey now?

21:11.966 --> 21:13.620
I was talking to Gibbs.

21:13.663 --> 21:15.361
You can always turn back.

21:15.404 --> 21:17.972
♪ Show me the way
to go home ♪

21:18.015 --> 21:21.932
♪ I'm tired and I want
to go to bed. ♪

21:21.976 --> 21:23.456
Never mind. I'm good.

21:23.499 --> 21:24.544
I'm okay.

21:27.503 --> 21:28.765
WOMAN:
Who's there?

21:28.809 --> 21:32.291
I thought I heard singing.

21:32.334 --> 21:34.771
You did. Bad singing.

21:40.821 --> 21:46.000
You can go ahead and shoot,
but I'll go down swinging.

21:49.395 --> 21:51.745
Special Agent Gibbs.

21:51.788 --> 21:53.703
NCIS.

21:54.748 --> 21:56.967
NCIS?

21:57.011 --> 21:59.970
What is this,
a company picnic?

22:00.014 --> 22:02.799
Yeah. You on your way out?

22:02.843 --> 22:05.541
My truck is parked on the other
side of the orchard there.

22:06.934 --> 22:08.544
Name's Jane.

22:08.588 --> 22:10.285
Looks like you caught
some trout, Jane.

22:10.329 --> 22:13.375
Yeah, trout. A few crappie.

22:13.419 --> 22:15.943
Worm?

22:15.986 --> 22:17.771
My dad taught me
to use canned corn.

22:17.814 --> 22:19.468
I come up here
every year

22:19.512 --> 22:21.514
to fish and to quit smoking

22:21.557 --> 22:23.254
and every year
I'm only half successful.

22:24.430 --> 22:26.083
Did you happen to see
anybody else out here?

22:26.127 --> 22:28.956
Maybe someone
with nine fingers.

22:28.999 --> 22:30.740
That's awfully specific.

22:30.784 --> 22:32.394
Uh-uh. No.

22:32.438 --> 22:34.222
This have to do
with that parachute

22:34.265 --> 22:35.571
I saw a little ways back?

22:37.834 --> 22:39.619
Should I be worried?

22:39.662 --> 22:41.795
Would you like an escort
to your truck?

22:41.838 --> 22:44.580
From you

22:45.842 --> 22:49.324
Thanks. I'll take my chances.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.195
Oh, and that,
uh, parachute,

22:51.239 --> 22:53.459
it's about two miles due south.

22:53.502 --> 22:56.070
Just right off
the trail there.

22:56.113 --> 22:58.507
South? I thought
you said east.

22:58.551 --> 23:00.074
FORNELL:
I got us close.

23:00.117 --> 23:02.424
I didn't hear anything
from the Eagle Scout.

23:02.468 --> 23:03.904
I don't know.

23:03.947 --> 23:06.341
Sounds like that scoreboard's
back to goose eggs.

23:07.255 --> 23:09.039
I wanted to surprise you.

23:09.083 --> 23:10.737
I've only been in
town for two weeks.

23:10.780 --> 23:12.216
I was starting to
get a little bored,

23:12.260 --> 23:14.915
so I just thought this
would be like old times.

23:14.958 --> 23:17.221
You know? Minus
the good beaches.

23:17.265 --> 23:18.919
We had fun.

23:18.962 --> 23:20.616
Had.

23:20.660 --> 23:22.009
What is your deal?

23:22.052 --> 23:24.533
You're not still mad
about Bodhi?

23:24.577 --> 23:26.230
Oh, please.

23:26.274 --> 23:28.319
: Look, I'm sorry that
you got your heart broken,

23:28.363 --> 23:30.017
but I won fair and square.

23:30.060 --> 23:32.236
Nothing with you is ever fair.

23:32.280 --> 23:35.501
Do you want
to see a picture?

23:35.544 --> 23:37.851
Wait. You keep one with you?!

23:37.894 --> 23:39.113
Girl can dream, right?

23:39.156 --> 23:40.375
Put your phone away

23:40.419 --> 23:43.073
and get to the point
or get out of my office.

23:43.117 --> 23:45.162
Uh, if you two want
to talk in private,

23:45.206 --> 23:46.816
I can just come back.

23:46.860 --> 23:49.079
That might
be best, Ellie.Just wait.

23:50.603 --> 23:52.953
I have been case agent
on this since the beginning.

23:52.996 --> 23:54.520
I just want to see it through.

23:54.563 --> 23:56.522
And Jack,
if our friendship

23:56.565 --> 23:58.045
interferes with
that in any way,

23:58.088 --> 23:59.873
we don't have to interact.

23:59.916 --> 24:02.876
Just pretend I didn't
save your life in Bora Bora.

24:04.138 --> 24:06.749
What, you two went
to Bora Bora to surf?

24:06.793 --> 24:09.404
Nobody goes to Bora Bora
to surf.

24:09.448 --> 24:13.843
Okay. So then why does one
go to Bora Bora?

24:15.845 --> 24:17.368
The FBI gave you
what we had.

24:17.412 --> 24:20.459
I'm just asking that NCIS
do the same thing.

24:20.502 --> 24:24.898
To be clear, I saved you first.

24:24.941 --> 24:27.466
Those waves were sick, brah.

24:27.509 --> 24:28.771
:
Shut up.

24:28.815 --> 24:31.905
Just give her the file.
Give her the file.

24:31.948 --> 24:32.993
Okay.

24:33.036 --> 24:34.864
Thank you.

24:34.908 --> 24:36.257
Mm-hmm.

24:36.300 --> 24:37.824
Ugh.

24:37.867 --> 24:40.087
She would be fun
on karaoke night.

24:40.130 --> 24:43.177
But I should probably
double-check everything

24:43.220 --> 24:44.439
she just told us, right?

24:44.483 --> 24:47.529
With extreme prejudice.

24:47.573 --> 24:48.922
Thank you.

24:48.965 --> 24:50.489
You're welcome.

24:52.534 --> 24:54.275
Oh, Jane wasn't kidding.

24:54.318 --> 24:56.103
Good thing we followed
her directions.

24:56.146 --> 24:58.497
Could've sworn that parachute
was near a clearing.

24:58.540 --> 25:00.977
Just admit you were wrong.

25:01.021 --> 25:02.936
Ooh, I got to use
the little boy's room.

25:02.979 --> 25:05.547
Again?

25:05.591 --> 25:07.157
Hey, do you actually like

25:07.201 --> 25:10.334
hanging out with old
raisin bladder?

25:10.378 --> 25:12.554
GIBBS:
That's a ram-air canopy.

25:12.598 --> 25:14.425
That's not easy.

25:14.469 --> 25:17.690
Our jumper has experience
and a head start.

25:17.733 --> 25:19.430
NCIS putting up roadblocks?

25:19.474 --> 25:21.781
'Cause I am getting
no signal.

25:21.824 --> 25:24.000
PHIL: A little
help over here.

25:24.044 --> 25:26.960
What now? Does he want us
to hold it for him?

25:27.003 --> 25:29.919
PHIL: Gibbs!
I need your help!Come on.

25:29.963 --> 25:32.531
Oh, no. My leg!

25:32.574 --> 25:34.533
Hey. You okay?

25:34.576 --> 25:36.143
I slipped and fell.

25:36.186 --> 25:37.927
I think it's broken, Gibbs.

25:37.971 --> 25:39.625
This guy.

25:39.668 --> 25:42.062
Our scorecard needs
negative integers.

25:42.105 --> 25:43.933
Or a few more zeroes.

25:43.977 --> 25:47.676
Because when I landed,
I saw this in the branches.

25:49.243 --> 25:50.549
FORNELL: You got
to be kidding me.

25:50.592 --> 25:51.724
The stolen money?

25:51.767 --> 25:54.074
Our robber must've lost it
during the jump.

25:54.117 --> 25:56.903
You, zero;

25:56.946 --> 25:59.993
me, 350,000.

26:03.083 --> 26:04.911
That's good work...

26:04.954 --> 26:06.869
Phil.

26:06.913 --> 26:08.654
GIBBS: I got it.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.365
You always hike
with duct tape?

26:24.408 --> 26:26.106
GIBBS:
Yeah. You don't?

26:26.149 --> 26:27.368
Just leave me
behind, Gibbs.

26:27.411 --> 26:29.283
We're getting you back
to the cabin, Phil.

26:29.326 --> 26:32.634
If that money is still in this
forest, so is our robber.

26:32.678 --> 26:34.549
He's gonna be looking
for it and us.

26:34.593 --> 26:35.855
I'll just slow you down.

26:35.898 --> 26:36.899
Come on. Get you up.

26:39.510 --> 26:41.382
Oh, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

26:41.425 --> 26:42.470
Hey, what, your leg?

26:42.513 --> 26:43.776
No, the Fishlord 3000.

26:43.819 --> 26:46.779
It was in my
bag when I fell.

26:48.781 --> 26:50.434
Thank you.

26:50.478 --> 26:52.219
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Let's reel 'em in!

26:52.262 --> 26:54.221
Spared no expense.

26:55.526 --> 26:57.964
Give me that thing.

26:58.007 --> 27:00.488
Give me this.Okay.

27:01.794 --> 27:03.883
All right.
:
All right.

27:03.926 --> 27:06.755
Let's go.Ow. Ow! Oh, oh, oh, boy.

27:06.799 --> 27:08.104
GIBBS:
What?

27:08.148 --> 27:09.715
Anybody bring bourbon?

27:11.717 --> 27:12.935
What?

27:23.859 --> 27:27.167
It's only because
I feel sorry for you.

27:28.995 --> 27:30.561
Oh.

27:31.475 --> 27:33.477
Let's go.
Ow!

27:33.521 --> 27:35.784
Slow down. Oh.

27:35.828 --> 27:37.090
Hey, boss.

27:37.133 --> 27:39.092
Just, uh,
checking in again.

27:39.135 --> 27:40.963
Give us a call.

27:41.007 --> 27:43.052
Tim, Gibbs is fine.

27:43.096 --> 27:44.750
Gibbs is Gibbs.

27:44.793 --> 27:46.882
Anything on those roadblocks?

27:46.926 --> 27:48.231
Nothing.

27:48.275 --> 27:50.277
And nothing
from San Diego, either.

27:50.320 --> 27:51.844
What's in San Diego?

27:51.887 --> 27:53.715
Bodhi.

27:53.759 --> 27:56.370
That's the guy that
Agent Sloane and Agent Monet

27:56.413 --> 27:58.459
have been, uh, fighting over.

27:58.502 --> 28:00.417
I e-mailed my buddy
at Camp Pendleton.

28:00.461 --> 28:01.897
Why?

28:01.941 --> 28:04.291
To find out if Agent Monet
has a type, man.

28:04.334 --> 28:05.988
Maybe Bodhi's an agent.

28:06.032 --> 28:07.294
Or just a surfer.

28:07.337 --> 28:10.863
Or maybe both,
like Keanu in Point Break.

28:10.906 --> 28:12.081
You're getting warmer, Nick.

28:12.125 --> 28:14.780
What? She tell you
the whole story?

28:14.823 --> 28:16.825
Yup.You gonna tell me?

28:16.869 --> 28:18.261
Probably not.

28:18.305 --> 28:21.438
Uh, WITSEC just sent over
their file on Franklin Poe.

28:22.657 --> 28:24.485
You and Sloane don't trust
Agent Monet?

28:24.528 --> 28:26.008
Or me, apparently.

28:26.052 --> 28:27.314
McGEE:
We're gonna need to know

28:27.357 --> 28:28.271
where Poe might be headed,

28:28.315 --> 28:29.925
other than South America.

28:29.969 --> 28:31.797
Well, when someone enters
Witness Protection,

28:31.840 --> 28:34.016
they have to forfeit
all property and holdings.

28:34.060 --> 28:35.496
Including their passport.

28:35.539 --> 28:37.541
International travel
is strictly prohibited.

28:37.585 --> 28:39.543
Not if you're traveling
by wheel well.

28:39.587 --> 28:41.589
Well, I doubt it was
his first choice.

28:41.632 --> 28:43.112
SLOANE:
He didn't have any options.

28:43.156 --> 28:45.506
When the FBI transferred
Poe to his new home,

28:45.549 --> 28:48.509
he specifically
requested to drive,

28:48.552 --> 28:50.163
citing "fear of flying."

28:50.206 --> 28:51.425
And parachuting's
a big jump.

28:51.468 --> 28:52.774
In many ways.

28:52.818 --> 28:53.949
The guy had help.

28:53.993 --> 28:55.429
On the ground or in the air?

28:55.472 --> 28:58.345
Hey. I thought Izzy said

28:58.388 --> 29:00.042
that she was
the case agent.

29:00.086 --> 29:02.262
Yeah, she did.

29:04.351 --> 29:06.396
But her name isn't mentioned
anywhere in this file.

29:10.009 --> 29:13.664
♪ Show me the way to go home

29:13.708 --> 29:16.580
♪ I'm tired and I want

29:16.624 --> 29:18.147

29:18.191 --> 29:19.801
Little is right.

29:19.845 --> 29:21.411
You had two drinks
and you're drunk.

29:21.455 --> 29:23.805
The Brookses are lightweights,
historically speaking.

29:23.849 --> 29:25.938
Sure I can't take another
one of those bags, Gibbs?

29:25.981 --> 29:27.243
Uh-uh, it balances
the other dead weight

29:27.287 --> 29:29.158
and some god-awful singing.

29:29.202 --> 29:30.769
It's true. I am dead weight.

29:30.812 --> 29:32.205
All three of us are, really.

29:32.248 --> 29:33.293
Here we go.

29:33.336 --> 29:35.774
Divorced. Lonely. Older.

29:35.817 --> 29:36.818
Speak for yourself.

29:36.862 --> 29:38.777
The clarity is uncanny.

29:38.820 --> 29:40.996
All we have is each other.Shh.

29:41.040 --> 29:44.086
It's okay, Gibbs.
Let your feelings out.Shh, shh.

29:44.130 --> 29:46.001
Coyotes?

29:46.045 --> 29:48.090
Sit down.

29:52.051 --> 29:54.705
Stay here. Watch him.

29:54.749 --> 29:56.795
Gibbs, I...

30:03.149 --> 30:04.803
I'll be right back.

30:04.846 --> 30:06.761
Don't shoot yourself, Hemingway.

30:09.285 --> 30:11.418
Not Hemingway.

30:11.461 --> 30:14.421
It's Brooks. Phil Brooks.

30:14.464 --> 30:18.251
And here we have my favorite
room on the tour.

30:18.294 --> 30:20.296
Four walls and a mirror

30:20.340 --> 30:22.385
is all you ever needed
to break somebody, Jack.

30:22.429 --> 30:24.823
I miss watching you work.

30:24.866 --> 30:27.869
Then today's your lucky day.

30:27.913 --> 30:29.871
That's funny.

30:29.915 --> 30:31.264
Are you gonna grill me
about our bet on Bodhi?

30:31.307 --> 30:33.962
Wait, they bet on guys?

30:34.789 --> 30:36.095
That's weird.

30:36.138 --> 30:38.532
But possibly hot.

30:38.575 --> 30:40.099
This isn't about
old times, Izzy.

30:40.142 --> 30:42.362
Please, have a seat.

30:42.405 --> 30:43.580
Yeah, that's not
gonna happen.

30:43.624 --> 30:46.845
Then why don't you stop lying?

30:46.888 --> 30:49.238
You haven't been on this case
since the beginning.

30:49.282 --> 30:50.892
You were only assigned
this morning

30:50.936 --> 30:53.416
after NCIS got involved.

30:53.460 --> 30:55.375
As usual, you're
overanalyzing.

30:55.418 --> 30:58.552
You came here to take advantage
of our friendship. Why?

30:58.595 --> 31:03.513
And how dare you guilt-trip me
with Bora Bora.

31:03.557 --> 31:06.821
I know your
pressure points, too.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.475
Don't make me press.

31:08.518 --> 31:09.476
Please press.

31:11.391 --> 31:13.828
I was sent on damage control.

31:13.872 --> 31:15.917
Okay.Poe's robbery and escape

31:15.961 --> 31:18.441
look bad for the Bureau.Duh. And?

31:18.485 --> 31:21.009
And what you don't know,
what nobody else knows,

31:21.053 --> 31:24.534
is that a former FBI agent
might've helped him do it.

31:24.578 --> 31:25.884
Who?

31:25.927 --> 31:27.929
When Poe was put
into Witness Protection,

31:27.973 --> 31:30.932
he ended up falling
for his FBI handler,

31:30.976 --> 31:32.455
Anna Jenlowe.

31:32.499 --> 31:34.066
The real case agent.

31:34.109 --> 31:35.806
Yeah. She eventually
resigned

31:35.850 --> 31:36.982
and moved in with him.

31:37.025 --> 31:39.332
It was unusual, but not illegal.

31:39.375 --> 31:41.334
Until Poe disappeared.

31:41.377 --> 31:43.379
That's the problem.

31:43.423 --> 31:45.816
The FBI can't find her, either.

31:48.602 --> 31:50.647
Well, I'll be damned.

31:50.691 --> 31:56.262
This is the parachute that
I saw from the ridge.

31:56.305 --> 31:58.917
I am back on
the board, baby.

32:01.702 --> 32:03.095
Missing a finger.

32:03.138 --> 32:06.794
Our escaped robber
didn't survive the landing.

32:06.837 --> 32:08.404
So who was in

32:08.448 --> 32:10.363
that other parachute?

32:13.453 --> 32:14.802
Same person who did this.

32:21.200 --> 32:22.766
FORNELL:
Coyotes found him.

32:22.810 --> 32:25.421
Coyotes didn't stab him.

32:27.554 --> 32:30.513
Now who do we know
with a big

32:33.255 --> 32:34.430
Tobias.

32:36.215 --> 32:37.825
Damn it.

32:37.868 --> 32:42.047
So there was a second person
in that wheel well.

32:43.309 --> 32:44.658
Call Gibbs.

32:44.701 --> 32:49.402
AUTOMATED VOICE:
This mailbox is full.

32:49.445 --> 32:50.707
No.

32:52.405 --> 32:54.407
Phil?

32:54.450 --> 32:57.192
Phil!
Uh-uh.

32:57.236 --> 32:59.673
Sorry, Gibbs.

32:59.716 --> 33:01.849
I didn't hear her
in time.

33:01.892 --> 33:04.504
She was following us, and...

33:04.547 --> 33:06.071
I'm a little drunk.

33:06.114 --> 33:08.943
The gun, toss it over.

33:10.423 --> 33:12.425
No one else needs to die.

33:13.643 --> 33:16.951
I didn't murder that camper.
He came at me.

33:16.995 --> 33:19.432
It was self-defense.
Okay.

33:19.475 --> 33:22.957
Come on in, explain it.

33:23.001 --> 33:26.047
We've both told that lie.

33:26.091 --> 33:27.962
Stop!

33:28.006 --> 33:30.051
Stop trying to close
the distance!

33:31.487 --> 33:33.315
You're a cop?

33:36.710 --> 33:39.800
I know there's no going back.

33:47.460 --> 33:50.115
Don't even think about it.

33:50.158 --> 33:52.030
Okay.

33:52.073 --> 33:54.380
The only way now

33:54.423 --> 33:56.121
is forward.

33:56.164 --> 33:58.993
The money.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.647
Let him go.

34:00.690 --> 34:02.866
Money first.

34:02.910 --> 34:05.608
Gibbs, don't do it.

34:05.652 --> 34:08.611
First time I agree
with Phil.

34:08.655 --> 34:13.225
If there's no going back,
she'll just shoot us all.

34:23.670 --> 34:26.107
All right.

34:26.151 --> 34:28.196
Okay.

34:31.678 --> 34:33.201
A deal's a deal.

34:34.681 --> 34:36.509
But...

34:36.552 --> 34:38.554
damn, you should've
listened to your friends.

35:00.837 --> 35:03.362
Well, ashes are cold.

35:03.405 --> 35:05.190
Still no signal.

35:05.233 --> 35:06.582
You really think Gibbs
found something out there?

35:06.626 --> 35:08.106
Gibbs is Gibbs.

35:08.149 --> 35:10.369
I got to sit down.FORNELL:
I should've known better.

35:10.412 --> 35:12.153
Coming out here
was a giant mistake.

35:12.197 --> 35:13.981
PHIL: Oh, my leg
is killing me.

35:14.024 --> 35:15.374
TORRES:
Whoa.

35:15.417 --> 35:17.245
Wh

35:17.289 --> 35:20.161
A tree exploded in my face.

35:20.205 --> 35:21.423
Would've been
your chest exploding

35:21.467 --> 35:23.033
if I hadn't saved your life.

35:23.077 --> 35:26.385
I take it these weren't
camping injuries.

35:26.428 --> 35:28.213
Hey, Gibbs, we got two jumpers.

35:28.256 --> 35:30.258
Yeah, met them both.

35:30.302 --> 35:31.607
Man's dead.

35:31.651 --> 35:33.261
Woman, she's gone.

35:33.305 --> 35:35.133
Said her name was Jane.

35:35.176 --> 35:36.612
Anna Jenlowe.

35:36.656 --> 35:39.180
Her photo's been added to
the BOLOs and roadblocks.

35:40.616 --> 35:43.489
That's her. She's got
a generous head start.

35:43.532 --> 35:44.925
Get them both to the hospital.

35:44.968 --> 35:47.188
Oh, thank God.No, no, no, no. I'm good.

35:47.232 --> 35:50.539
Torres, give me your
phone. Let's go.

35:50.583 --> 35:52.802
Where are you going, Gibbs?
She's long gone.

35:54.369 --> 35:56.676
McGEE: She's had a
pilot's license for 20 years,

35:56.719 --> 35:58.591
and her father
was in the Air Force.

35:58.634 --> 36:01.681
Amazing what you learn when
the FBI's not holding back.

36:01.724 --> 36:04.205
Anna Jenlowe practically
grew up in an airplane.

36:04.249 --> 36:06.903
Sneaking on that plane
had to be her idea.

36:06.947 --> 36:08.992
It could be how she plans
to escape again.

36:09.036 --> 36:10.255
Going back to the well?

36:11.865 --> 36:14.781
So I'm running a list of old
aliases she used as an agent.

36:14.824 --> 36:16.478
Hmm.

36:18.480 --> 36:20.526
Uh-oh, turns out I was right,

36:20.569 --> 36:22.180
but this time
she is not sneaking.

36:22.223 --> 36:23.398
She bought a ticket.

36:23.442 --> 36:24.617
One of her FBI aliases

36:24.660 --> 36:26.575
is booked on a flight to Miami.

36:26.619 --> 36:27.924
Ronda Popovich.

36:27.968 --> 36:30.579
Purchased an hour ago
from a cafe near Dulles.

36:30.623 --> 36:32.712
We got to stop that plane.
I'm gonna call airport security.

36:32.755 --> 36:35.236
Yeah. Oh, better make it
the FAA.

36:35.280 --> 36:37.456
That flight took off
six minutes ago.

36:42.722 --> 36:43.810
Hey, Nick.

36:43.853 --> 36:44.941
GIBBS : Kasie.Oh, Gibbs!

36:44.985 --> 36:46.160
GIBBS:
Can you track a signal?

36:46.204 --> 36:47.683
Yeah, of course I can.
Sure, no problem.

36:47.727 --> 36:49.337
Agent McGee,
that flight's already

36:49.381 --> 36:50.904
on its way to Miami.

36:50.947 --> 36:53.515
Which is why we need to know
if Anna Jenlowe is on board.

36:53.559 --> 36:56.039
I thought the passenger name
was "Ronda Popovich"?

36:56.083 --> 36:57.258
It's a fake I.D.

36:57.302 --> 36:59.129
She bought a ticket,
but I need to confirm

36:59.173 --> 37:00.566
she actually made the flight.

37:00.609 --> 37:02.263
That requires
the airline manifest.

37:02.307 --> 37:03.917
Yes, that's what I'm asking for.

37:03.960 --> 37:07.312
Okay. You could ask nicely.

37:08.704 --> 37:10.489
You know what?
I'm done being nice.

37:10.532 --> 37:12.621
We have a former
FBI agent on the run

37:12.665 --> 37:15.755
and before it becomes a hostage
situation, or even worse,

37:15.798 --> 37:18.975
I need to know that she actually
made the damn plane, now.

37:19.019 --> 37:22.196
I-- Right away, sir.

37:25.330 --> 37:27.549
Put up the door camera.

37:30.726 --> 37:32.859
McGee!It appears to be Kasie Hines.

37:32.902 --> 37:35.078
You think? Let her in.McGee, open up! McGee!

37:37.429 --> 37:39.387
Sorry about the banging.

37:39.431 --> 37:41.128
I'm still a temporary employee.
I don't have eyeball access.

37:41.171 --> 37:42.825
What's wrong?

37:42.869 --> 37:46.438
The ticket was just a diversion.
Our woman is not on that plane.

37:46.481 --> 37:48.570
You got the manifest?No, I just talked to Gibbs.

37:48.614 --> 37:50.311
We just tracked
Anna Jenlowe going south

37:50.355 --> 37:51.965
on a highway outside Manassas.

37:52.008 --> 37:54.707
Wait, what?It's... a little unusual.

37:54.750 --> 37:57.405
All right,
just tell me on the way.Yeah, okay.

38:11.941 --> 38:14.553
♪

38:34.529 --> 38:35.791
Excuse me?

38:35.835 --> 38:38.141
TORRES:
Be right there.

38:40.143 --> 38:43.582
Hey. What can I do for you?

38:43.625 --> 38:45.366
Can I get $50
on pump seven, please,

38:45.410 --> 38:47.716
and a pack of Reds.I don't mean to be rude,

38:47.760 --> 38:50.589
but you should rethink
your choices.

38:50.632 --> 38:54.114
Yeah, I know,
smoking's bad for my health.

38:54.157 --> 38:55.985
Yes, and so am I.

38:56.029 --> 38:58.727
Uh-uh, uh-uh.

38:58.771 --> 39:01.730
Let go.You know, hiding under
airplanes, murder,

39:01.774 --> 39:04.385
interrupting the
boss's "me time"...

39:05.865 --> 39:07.823
Those are all
bad choices.

39:09.651 --> 39:12.262
How the hell
did you find me?

39:20.880 --> 39:23.578
Spared no expense.

39:23.622 --> 39:26.712
Hey, I hear they added GPS and
social media to that new model.

39:26.755 --> 39:28.844
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Let's reel 'em in!

39:39.812 --> 39:41.944
Nowthe FBI takes over?

39:41.988 --> 39:44.033
After we close the case.

39:44.077 --> 39:47.602
They get to control the story.

39:47.646 --> 39:49.822
Agent McGee, you were right.

39:49.865 --> 39:51.650
You'll have to be more specific.

39:51.693 --> 39:54.043
I got used to that
East Coast mentality.

39:54.087 --> 39:55.218
Ah.

39:56.872 --> 39:58.874
I was doing my job.

39:58.918 --> 40:01.311
Has lying to me
ever worked, Izzy?

40:01.355 --> 40:02.835
It was worth a try.

40:02.878 --> 40:05.794
I'm the new agent in town,
I wanted to score some points.

40:05.838 --> 40:07.579
Right.

40:07.622 --> 40:10.712
We got into a lot of trouble
back in the day, Jack.

40:10.756 --> 40:12.671
Yeah, we did.

40:12.714 --> 40:14.324
We still could.

40:21.419 --> 40:25.248
And, uh, here's that
photo of Bodhi

40:25.292 --> 40:26.728
you were asking about, Nick.

40:29.383 --> 40:33.082
I'll see you next week
for that motorcycle tour.

40:33.126 --> 40:35.389
What?

40:35.433 --> 40:38.131
Oh, I don't... I don't know
what she's talking about.

40:39.045 --> 40:43.397
Wait, Bodhi is not a man?

40:43.441 --> 40:46.008
So much better than a man.

40:46.052 --> 40:49.838
Bodhi is a
restored 1974

40:49.882 --> 40:52.450
Ford Bronco convertible.

40:52.493 --> 40:53.929
Named after
Patrick Swayze

40:53.973 --> 40:55.583
in Point Break.
Ugh!

40:55.627 --> 40:58.020
Jack, uh, did you bet on a car?

40:58.064 --> 41:00.414
If you want the ultimate, Nick,
you got to be willing

41:00.458 --> 41:02.416
to pay the ultimate price.

41:02.460 --> 41:05.463
So many questions.
I have so many questions.

41:05.506 --> 41:07.116
Save it. We got arrest reports

41:07.160 --> 41:09.205
to fill out and
I want to get them done

41:09.249 --> 41:13.079
before Gibbs gets back from
his last two days of leave.

41:21.435 --> 41:23.959
You gonna
share or what?

41:27.397 --> 41:30.792
Oh. Appreciate it, Cyclops.

41:30.836 --> 41:33.012
Least I can do, Gimpy.

41:33.055 --> 41:35.667
Thanks for the, uh,
official invite, Gibbs.

41:35.710 --> 41:36.929
This is special.

41:36.972 --> 41:39.453
Just three men realizing
they need each other.

41:39.497 --> 41:41.455
Why do you have to ruin
everything?

41:41.499 --> 41:43.501
Why do you got to say something
stupid like that, Phil?

Sorry, sorry.
