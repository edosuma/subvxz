WEBVTT

00:08.000 --> 00:09.501
Oh, hey,

00:09.567 --> 00:11.134
I thought you were
hanging Christmas lights.

00:11.200 --> 00:13.200
Oh, I took a coffee break,
union rules.

00:13.267 --> 00:15.534
Well, you better hurry up,
it's going to start
raining any minute,

00:15.601 --> 00:17.768
and you know how Seth
loves his rooftop reindeer.

00:17.833 --> 00:19.367
Yeah, don't worry,
it'll be up by dinner.

00:19.434 --> 00:22.034
Oh, speaking of dinner,
are you going to bring a guest?

00:22.100 --> 00:24.067
That's pretty subtle,
Kirsten.

00:24.134 --> 00:25.701
I'm not saying
you'd bring Taylor,

00:25.768 --> 00:27.768
I'm just letting you know
that she's welcome.
Uh-huh.

00:27.833 --> 00:29.734
Well, I don't know.

00:29.800 --> 00:31.401
I don't know,
it's, uh, it's just...

00:31.467 --> 00:34.234
Oh, you think that if you invite
her, she's your girlfriend.

00:35.734 --> 00:37.034
Boy, so predictable.

00:37.100 --> 00:39.601
Hey, now, inviting a girl
over for Christmas Eve,

00:39.668 --> 00:41.367
that's like making
some sort of announcement.

00:41.434 --> 00:42.601
It's Chrismukkah.

00:42.668 --> 00:44.034
We make our own rules.

00:44.100 --> 00:45.668
Fine.

00:45.734 --> 00:46.701
Set a place for her.

00:46.768 --> 00:48.000
I'll invite her today.
Great.

00:48.067 --> 00:50.900
Okay.
Oh, my ham guy.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.074

01:11.034 --> 01:13.367
Can't believe we're spending
Christmas in the ghetto.

01:13.434 --> 01:15.267
It's not the ghetto.

01:15.334 --> 01:18.034
It's Riverside, and it's
where our family is from.

01:18.100 --> 01:20.267
I thought we were
in denial about that.

01:20.334 --> 01:22.567
Kaitlin, in case
you hadn't noticed,

01:22.634 --> 01:24.534
we're a little short
on family these days.

01:24.601 --> 01:26.334
I think we should
take all we can get.

01:26.401 --> 01:29.401
TAYLOR:
* God rest ye merry gentlemen,
let nothing you dismay... *

01:29.467 --> 01:31.534
Oh, God, now it's caroling.

01:33.100 --> 01:34.734
Happy holidays.

01:34.800 --> 01:35.833
Hello.

01:35.900 --> 01:37.267
Is that a gift for me?

01:37.334 --> 01:38.768
'Cause I forgot to get you one.

01:38.833 --> 01:41.334
No, this is for Ryan.
I got him a George Foreman grill

01:41.401 --> 01:44.434
because he likes lean meat,
obviously.

01:44.501 --> 01:47.833
Lovely. So, Taylor, uh, Summer's
having dinner with the Cohens,

01:47.900 --> 01:50.134
but you're welcome
to come with us to Riverside,

01:50.200 --> 01:52.200
unless of course you're doing
something with your mother.

01:52.267 --> 01:54.334
Oh, no, no.

01:54.401 --> 01:56.100
She sent me a mass E-mail
last week.

01:56.167 --> 01:58.100
She's spending Christmas
in Cabo.

01:58.167 --> 01:59.434
She would've
invited me,

01:59.501 --> 02:01.167
but she knows that I don't like
Mexican food.

02:01.234 --> 02:03.833
But it's not a problem because
I'm having dinner over at Ryan's.

02:03.900 --> 02:06.467
Oh, I didn't know you
were invited over there.

02:06.534 --> 02:07.933
I'm not...
well, yet.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.033
But I'm sure he's
going to ask me.

02:10.100 --> 02:11.434
Well, I mean,
I hope he does.

02:11.501 --> 02:13.534
Well, he will.

02:13.601 --> 02:15.833
So I better go over there
and give him his gift.

02:15.900 --> 02:17.134
Last chance to come
to Riverside.

02:17.200 --> 02:20.034
You want to watch my Aunt Cindy
do whippets underneath the mistletoe?

02:20.100 --> 02:22.467
Uh... no, thanks.

02:22.534 --> 02:24.434
But you guys have
a good time.

02:24.501 --> 02:25.567
Bye.

02:33.701 --> 02:35.234
<i>Feliz Navidad.</i>

02:35.301 --> 02:38.000
I know, where's
the mistletoe, right?

02:38.067 --> 02:39.334
But don't worry,
we can kiss anyway.

02:39.401 --> 02:41.501
Uh, Taylor, I'm a
little busy right now.

02:44.134 --> 02:45.601
Well, don't you want
your present?

02:45.668 --> 02:47.267
Just leave it right there.
I'll open it later.

02:49.434 --> 02:52.134
You know I just ran into Kirsten
in the kitchen,

02:52.200 --> 02:55.100
and she was talking to some guy
with a huge ham.

02:55.167 --> 02:58.367
Are you guys having dinner
or something?
Uh, yeah.

03:01.334 --> 03:02.401
Poor Ryan.

03:02.467 --> 03:05.768
All of his muscles are so developed,
except for the ones in his mouth.

03:05.833 --> 03:07.434
You want to invite me
to Chrismukkah,

03:07.501 --> 03:10.034
but you don't know how,
so I will save you the trouble.

03:10.100 --> 03:11.668
I would love to come.

03:11.734 --> 03:13.967
Taylor, look, I don't know
what's going on between us,

03:14.034 --> 03:15.634
but it's only been a few weeks.

03:17.434 --> 03:20.534
And you think if you invite me
to Chrismukkah,

03:20.601 --> 03:22.833
then that makes me
your girlfriend.

03:22.900 --> 03:25.734
I don't want to hurt
your feelings, but yeah.

03:27.701 --> 03:29.301
Hurt my feelings?

03:29.367 --> 03:31.367
Why would that hurt my feelings?

03:31.434 --> 03:34.634
Just because I spent
time and money

03:34.701 --> 03:36.134
getting you the perfect gift--

03:36.200 --> 03:38.734
which, by the way, happens to be
the deluxe version

03:38.800 --> 03:40.200
of the George Foreman grill--

03:40.267 --> 03:44.100
and in return you give me
a hot, steaming pile
of rejection.

03:44.167 --> 03:46.367
Well, you know,
I think that's just fine.

03:46.434 --> 03:47.867
(sighs)
Because I'm used
to it, okay?

03:47.933 --> 03:49.501
So here, here it is.

03:49.567 --> 03:50.668
Grill away.

03:50.734 --> 03:51.701
Taylor, I don't want this.

03:51.768 --> 03:53.167
No, I took your gift--

03:53.234 --> 03:54.634
the holiday-themed
rejection--

03:54.701 --> 03:55.734
so you should take it.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.933
No, you take it.
I bought it for you.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.100
You take it.
It's yours. I...

04:00.167 --> 04:01.401
Taylor!

04:02.334 --> 04:05.367
Whoa, it's going to pour.

04:05.434 --> 04:07.734
Are you sure this
is a Virginia ham?

04:27.200 --> 04:28.768
Taylor?

04:28.833 --> 04:31.867
Taylor, are you...
are you hurt?

04:31.933 --> 04:33.567
Only my heart, Ryan.

04:33.634 --> 04:34.768
Only my heart.

04:34.833 --> 04:36.234
Come on up,
I'll get you some ice.

04:36.301 --> 04:38.000
Oh, you're
offering me ice?

04:38.067 --> 04:40.634
Hmm, I guess I should
jump at that.

04:40.701 --> 04:42.267
Here.

04:42.334 --> 04:43.567
The receipt's inside.

04:43.634 --> 04:46.034
I hope you grill
your face.

05:15.501 --> 05:18.534
Oh, so, I was just
in the pool house...
What are you doing in there?

05:18.601 --> 05:21.234
I told the supervisor that
this is off-limits to the staff.

05:21.301 --> 05:23.334
What?

05:25.200 --> 05:26.334
Where is your supervisor?

05:26.401 --> 05:27.933
Uh, Kirsten, what are
you talking about?

05:28.000 --> 05:30.267
Excuse me, do I know you?

05:32.933 --> 05:39.100

I said do I know you?

Uh, look, I don't know
what's going on, but...

06:05.800 --> 06:07.633
I was up on the
roof with Taylor...

06:07.700 --> 06:08.734
Is this one of your guys?

06:08.800 --> 06:10.067
Nope, never seen him before.

06:10.134 --> 06:13.234
Oh, great.So now I just have
strangers wandering around my house.

06:13.301 --> 06:14.967
No, no, no.
Where's Seth?

06:15.034 --> 06:16.900
Oh, you're a friend
of my son's.

06:16.967 --> 06:18.500
He's at the comic
book store.

06:18.567 --> 06:21.267
If you run into him,
will you tell him
that I need him home by 5:00?

06:21.334 --> 06:22.900
Uh... I have a meeting.

06:22.967 --> 06:24.067
Now shoo.

06:24.134 --> 06:26.500
I don't want you wandering
around my house.

06:32.900 --> 06:36.001
Hey, kid,I got the feeling
the dragon lady wanted
you out of here.

06:44.201 --> 06:47.600
You see, this is why I feel
so strongly about this issue.

06:47.667 --> 06:50.401
Take Daryl here.
Last week he was homeless.

06:50.468 --> 06:54.301
But because of the money
we've raised, he has a future
to look forward to
in the new year.

06:54.368 --> 06:56.034
Well, you're quite the
philanthropist.

06:56.101 --> 06:57.067
Yes.

06:57.134 --> 06:58.267
And I help people.

06:58.334 --> 06:59.468
Julie.

06:59.533 --> 07:01.201
I love it when they call
me by my first name.

07:01.267 --> 07:03.401
What are you doing?
What is all this?

07:03.468 --> 07:05.633
Take this, it's a voucher
for the mission.

07:05.700 --> 07:07.134
Tell them I sent you.

07:07.201 --> 07:08.134
You don't know me?

07:08.201 --> 07:11.167
I know your pain.

07:11.234 --> 07:14.834
See, people think that
Newport Beach is a cold city,
a place of privilege.

07:14.900 --> 07:17.700
But even this poor street urchin
has found hope here.

07:17.767 --> 07:19.734
Now you just run
along now, honey.

07:21.134 --> 07:22.667
You heard the lady.

07:29.700 --> 07:30.900
You guys, come on.

07:30.967 --> 07:32.134
You guys, come on.
You guys, come on.

07:32.201 --> 07:34.234
Would you...
would you give me back...

07:34.301 --> 07:35.633
Would you give me back
my wallet?

07:35.700 --> 07:37.234
(mockingly):
Would you... would you
give me back my wallet?

07:37.301 --> 07:38.368
Seriously.

07:38.434 --> 07:39.767
Seriously.
Seriously.

07:41.434 --> 07:43.767
Hey, hey, give me that.

07:43.834 --> 07:44.934
Why, is this
your boyfriend?

07:45.001 --> 07:46.434
You guys should get a room.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.301
Yeah. So you can
make love in it.

07:48.368 --> 07:50.967
(scoffs)
I make love to ladies.

07:51.034 --> 07:53.267
Hey, man, thanks.
Do I know you from Brown?

07:53.334 --> 07:54.368
You go to Brown?

07:54.434 --> 07:55.967
Yeah. Who are you?

07:56.034 --> 07:58.234
You don't know me either?

07:58.301 --> 07:59.800
I can't believe this.

07:59.867 --> 08:00.834
Hey, dork,your girlfriend's
across the way.

08:00.900 --> 08:02.967
Which one?

08:03.034 --> 08:04.134
You should check her out.

08:04.201 --> 08:06.468
She looks good.

08:07.800 --> 08:09.600
How does Sandy Cohen
have such a loser for a kid?

08:09.667 --> 08:11.468
Wait, Sandy Cohen?
You know where he is?

08:11.533 --> 08:13.900
I think I heard he's
at a press conference over at the yacht club.

08:13.967 --> 08:15.034
Press conference?

08:15.101 --> 08:15.900
Press conference?

08:18.434 --> 08:21.967
Oh, just... just
look at her.

08:32.667 --> 08:33.967
Oh, I shouldn't be watching.

08:34.034 --> 08:36.400
Why, bad luck
to see the bride?

08:36.467 --> 08:38.833
Yeah, totally.

08:38.900 --> 08:39.967
Oh, God.

08:40.034 --> 08:41.034
You okay?

08:41.101 --> 08:42.201
Oh!

08:44.700 --> 08:46.667
<i>MAN:
So what are your plans
for the holidays?</i>

08:46.734 --> 08:49.468
This holiday,I think my wife and I
are just going to take it easy.

08:49.533 --> 08:50.834
Your wife?
I thought she
never rested.

08:50.900 --> 08:52.734
True, she's
a very busy lady.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.101
All right, Joe,
thanks very much.

08:54.167 --> 08:55.334
Thanks for your
time, Mr. Mayor.

08:55.401 --> 08:56.533
And thanks for
all your support.

08:56.600 --> 09:00.633
As I always say,
I am mayor of the greatest
city on earth.

09:00.700 --> 09:02.567
Vote Sandy Cohen!

09:05.267 --> 09:06.600
You're the mayor?

09:06.667 --> 09:08.201
Why, you want to call
for a recount?

09:08.267 --> 09:10.101
Happy holidays.
Uh, Sandy, Sandy.

09:10.167 --> 09:11.967
Something terrible is happening.

09:12.034 --> 09:14.001
And if anyone can make it
make sense, it's you.

09:14.067 --> 09:15.468
This guy bothering you,
Mr. Mayor?

09:15.533 --> 09:17.633
Uh, no.

09:17.700 --> 09:18.667
It's fine.
All right, kid,

09:18.734 --> 09:20.867
slow down, tell me
what the problem is.

09:20.934 --> 09:24.500
Okay. So, uh, I fell off
the roof this morning,

09:24.567 --> 09:26.101
and ever since then
nobody recognizes me.

09:26.167 --> 09:29.101
Even Kirsten threw me
out of the house.
You saw Kirsten?

09:29.167 --> 09:30.734
And Seth doesn't know
who I am either.

09:30.800 --> 09:32.267
And he's marrying Summer?

09:33.834 --> 09:36.667
I see that you're
having some trouble
and I sympathize
with that.

09:36.734 --> 09:40.967
But stalking me
and my family
is not the answer.

09:41.034 --> 09:43.201
Come on, and don't make a fuss.

09:46.700 --> 09:48.633
Oh, the poor kid.

09:54.434 --> 09:55.533
What's the matter?

09:55.600 --> 09:57.567
Can't find your boyfriend?

10:26.301 --> 10:27.334
Kirsten.

10:27.401 --> 10:28.468
What happened?

10:28.533 --> 10:31.167
Taylor and Ryan,
they were hanging decorations,

10:31.234 --> 10:33.267
and I guess the ladder fell.

10:33.334 --> 10:34.700
What did the doctors say?

10:34.767 --> 10:36.034
Well, they said apparently
there's no serious injury,

10:36.101 --> 10:38.500
we just have to wait
for them to wake up.

10:50.201 --> 10:51.267
Ryan?

10:51.334 --> 10:52.934
Is that you?

10:53.001 --> 10:54.134
Taylor.

10:54.201 --> 10:55.667
You know me?
Oh, my God.

10:56.700 --> 10:59.167
I found you.

11:03.034 --> 11:04.801
We're in a parallel universe.

11:04.867 --> 11:06.167
Exactly.
Okay.

11:06.233 --> 11:09.500
And I'm so grateful
that if I have to be
in a parallel universe,

11:09.567 --> 11:10.834
that you're here with me.

11:10.901 --> 11:12.133
Oh, that's...
Of course
you probably wish

11:12.200 --> 11:14.068
you were with someone you
actually wanted to date.

11:14.133 --> 11:15.400
That would be nice,
wouldn't it?

11:15.467 --> 11:17.601
Oh, even in a parallel
universe, she never stops.

11:17.667 --> 11:19.734
But I mean, we could also
be asleep, right? Or dead?

11:22.100 --> 11:24.068
Ow.
You're awake.

11:24.133 --> 11:25.901
As for being dead,
I'm guessing if we were,

11:25.968 --> 11:29.133
there would be some kind
of white light situation,

11:29.200 --> 11:30.367
maybe a guy
with a beard.

11:30.434 --> 11:32.200
Process of elimination,
parallel universe.

11:32.267 --> 11:33.500
How do you know all this?

11:33.567 --> 11:35.467
Oh, tenth grade I had
a little sci-fi phase.

11:35.534 --> 11:37.400
Alt-universes are huge.
Clearly, you and I

11:37.467 --> 11:39.200
have entered a world
where we don't exist.

11:39.267 --> 11:41.534
But don't despair.
I know the way back
to the real world.

11:41.601 --> 11:43.667
Yeah? Does it involve
me dating you?

11:43.734 --> 11:46.867
Well, well, look who's
funny in alt-world.

11:46.934 --> 11:48.334
I know.
No, Ryan,

11:48.400 --> 11:50.267
we have been sent here
to fix something.

11:50.334 --> 11:51.934
It's the only explanation.

11:52.001 --> 11:55.100
Someone or some ones
we know are in trouble.

11:55.167 --> 11:56.133
Summer?!

11:56.200 --> 11:57.701
Hi!
Hi!

11:57.767 --> 11:59.167
Kiss-kiss.

11:59.233 --> 12:00.068
Oh, my God.

12:00.133 --> 12:01.100
Let me see
the hardware.

12:01.167 --> 12:02.801
What, you mean
this old thing?

12:02.867 --> 12:04.567
(squeals):
Oh, my God!

12:04.634 --> 12:05.767
Four carats.

12:05.834 --> 12:06.867
Oh, my God, it's so pretty.

12:06.934 --> 12:08.068
Can I get a...?

12:08.133 --> 12:09.133
* Ice, ice... *

12:09.200 --> 12:10.534
* Baby! *

12:10.601 --> 12:12.400
(humming bass line
to "Ice, Ice, Baby")

12:12.467 --> 12:14.534
* Ice, ice, baby *
Hey, babe.

12:14.601 --> 12:15.567
Whoo!

12:15.634 --> 12:17.767
Alt-Summer is
a mindless bimbo.

12:17.834 --> 12:19.667
Get it started, Newport!

12:19.734 --> 12:20.801
Whoo!

12:20.867 --> 12:22.100
I'm so excited.

12:22.167 --> 12:23.133
So where's the groom?

12:23.200 --> 12:24.534
Oh, you know him,
he's parking.

12:24.601 --> 12:26.734
He won't let any of
the valets touch his Hummer.

12:26.801 --> 12:28.934
Right.
Because that's my job,
bitch.

12:29.001 --> 12:30.434
Right!

12:30.500 --> 12:32.367
Hey, Holly, looking ripped.

12:32.434 --> 12:33.701
Hey, Chester.

12:33.767 --> 12:35.834
What's up, Mrs. Me?
Mm-hmm, that's me.

12:35.901 --> 12:38.534
Okay, wait a second. I thought
you said she was marrying Seth.

12:38.601 --> 12:40.500
That's Che, or Chester,
I guess, in alt-reality.

12:40.567 --> 12:43.133
What's he doing here?
I thought he goes to Brown.

12:43.200 --> 12:47.400
Okay, what if three years ago
his family had planned to move here

12:47.467 --> 12:50.667
but you did instead,
taking the last spot
at Harbor?

12:50.734 --> 12:54.001
So without quality education for their child,
his family moves to Connecticut.

12:54.068 --> 12:55.734
But in a world where
you don't exist,

12:55.801 --> 12:58.467
the Harbor spot was open,
so his family moves here,

12:58.534 --> 13:00.801
thereby allowing Che
to fulfill his alt-destiny

13:00.867 --> 13:02.334
as a Newport bobble head.

13:02.400 --> 13:05.667
Well, obviously this is what
we've been sent here to fix.

13:05.734 --> 13:09.434
So, Summer, I saw the most rocked out
chairs at Bergdorf.
You have to come with me.

13:09.500 --> 13:11.400
Ooh... baby.

13:11.467 --> 13:12.734
Do you mind?

13:12.801 --> 13:15.968
Um, no, I'll just
go get pumped.

13:16.034 --> 13:17.068
But that's my job, bitch.

13:17.133 --> 13:20.200
Oh, yeah, give it up.
Whoo!

13:20.267 --> 13:21.767
Ooh...

13:23.233 --> 13:25.133
(gasps):
Hey, bitch!

13:25.200 --> 13:26.934
Okay, we need to get
started right away.

13:27.001 --> 13:29.100
You go to Seth, find out
where it all went wrong.

13:29.167 --> 13:31.133
I will follow Summer
and do some recon.

13:31.200 --> 13:32.367
Uh, where do we meet?

13:32.434 --> 13:34.500
It's alt-universe.

13:34.567 --> 13:36.001
We'll just find
each other.

13:39.734 --> 13:41.233
Their MRIs came back normal,

13:41.300 --> 13:44.801
no brain damage,
no cause for alarm.

13:44.867 --> 13:46.267
They'll wake up soon, I'm sure.

13:46.334 --> 13:47.667
Is there anything
we can do to help?

13:47.734 --> 13:48.867
Talk to them.

13:48.934 --> 13:52.834
Make sure they're surrounded
by familiar voices,
music, even smells.

13:52.901 --> 13:54.634
Anything that you think
might stimulate them.

13:54.701 --> 13:55.834
Okay, thank you.

13:55.901 --> 13:56.934
Thank you.

13:57.001 --> 13:59.068
Well, somebody should
find Taylor's mom.

13:59.133 --> 14:00.267
I guess I'll do that.

14:00.334 --> 14:01.801
Ew, signing up for
the suicide mission.

14:01.867 --> 14:04.434
Oh, my ham. I have to go home
and turn off the oven.

14:04.500 --> 14:06.133
Seth and I will take
care of the ham.

14:06.200 --> 14:09.867
In fact, she just said we should surround them
with familiar sounds and smells.

14:09.934 --> 14:13.934
So I say we bring Chrismukkah
to the hospital.

14:14.001 --> 14:15.400
KIRSTEN:
That's a great idea.

14:15.467 --> 14:17.200
And I'll look after
Taylor and Ryan.

14:17.267 --> 14:20.667
And you be careful
with my ham.

14:20.734 --> 14:22.133
I'll be very careful.

14:26.233 --> 14:28.233
We're still getting it checked
if it's real.

14:33.068 --> 14:35.567
Uh, baby, this is business.
I've got to take this.

14:35.634 --> 14:37.133
Okay.

14:39.167 --> 14:40.701
Hey, baby.

14:42.467 --> 14:43.500
Yeah.

14:43.567 --> 14:45.467
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

14:45.534 --> 14:46.667
I'll walk it.

14:49.334 --> 14:51.601
You wearing that thong
I bought you?

14:51.667 --> 14:52.834
Whoo-hoo.

14:52.901 --> 14:54.467
Not for long.

14:54.534 --> 14:56.701
All right, love you, too.
Bye.

15:03.601 --> 15:04.634
Bye, baby.

15:21.068 --> 15:22.367
Hello?

15:23.467 --> 15:24.467
Hello?

15:24.534 --> 15:26.200
Oh, it's you again.
Looking for Seth?

15:26.267 --> 15:28.634
Uh, yeah, they told me at the
comic book store he came home.

15:28.701 --> 15:29.801
Well, I haven't seen him yet.

15:29.867 --> 15:31.068
You might want
to try him upstairs. Honey?

15:31.133 --> 15:32.934
Could you bring
me my glass?

15:33.001 --> 15:35.167
Here you go, sweetheart.

15:35.233 --> 15:36.367
Oh, thank you.

15:37.367 --> 15:38.233
Jimmy?

15:38.300 --> 15:39.801
You know my husband?

15:39.867 --> 15:42.233
I don't believe
we've actually met.

15:43.334 --> 15:45.667
Oh, this is
a friend of Seth's.

15:45.734 --> 15:48.034
Oh.
I know, it must be
a Christmas miracle.

15:48.100 --> 15:50.100
Well, you should come
to the party tonight.

15:50.167 --> 15:51.934
All of Newport's
going to be there.

15:52.001 --> 15:55.267
Well, they better be,
if they want to keep
doing business with
the Newport Group.

15:55.334 --> 15:56.801
Seth!
JIMMY:
He's not home.

15:56.867 --> 15:59.534
He's probably out
stalking Summer Roberts.

15:59.601 --> 16:01.300
(Kirsten chuckles)
I'm going to go.

16:02.467 --> 16:04.901
Well, you should stop by,
it starts around 7:00.

16:07.367 --> 16:08.434
Interesting.

16:16.767 --> 16:19.667
SANDY:
Oh, and "philanthropist"
means you help people.

16:19.734 --> 16:21.500
Oh, well, you learn
something every day.

16:21.567 --> 16:23.200
Listen, are you coming
home before the party?

16:23.267 --> 16:24.734
You know how you sweat
through your shirts.

16:24.801 --> 16:26.934
SANDY:
Can't we make some excuse?
Listen, honey,

16:27.001 --> 16:29.834
as long as you're mayor
and she is head of
the Newport Group,

16:29.901 --> 16:31.634
you're gonna have to
deal with each other.

16:31.701 --> 16:34.601
Honestly, I don't know how
you were ever married
to that ice queen.

16:35.934 --> 16:37.667
Well, we were different
people back then.

16:37.734 --> 16:39.434
I'll be home
in a couple hours.

16:39.500 --> 16:40.467
Bye.

17:02.968 --> 17:04.400
Joinx!

17:17.834 --> 17:20.800
(Chester barking)

17:20.867 --> 17:23.968
(Julie squealing)

17:29.667 --> 17:31.133
Double-O joinx.

17:33.300 --> 17:34.500
Oh!

17:34.567 --> 17:36.233
CHESTER (groans):
Oh, give it to me!

17:36.300 --> 17:38.034
Oh! Daddy like!

17:38.100 --> 17:39.233
Daddy like!

17:39.300 --> 17:40.367
I'm a bad kitten!

17:46.100 --> 17:47.200
Mima?

17:47.267 --> 17:48.367
Hi.

17:48.434 --> 17:49.767
No?

17:49.834 --> 17:51.334
Yes, you don't know me.

17:51.400 --> 17:53.167
Uh, I was just...

17:53.233 --> 17:54.334
You come visit Missy Cooper?

17:54.400 --> 17:55.367
Yes,

17:55.434 --> 17:57.467
yes, that's
exactly what...

17:57.534 --> 17:58.701
She come home 3:00.

17:58.767 --> 18:00.334
Plane from Berkeley.

18:08.634 --> 18:10.867
Triple-O joinx.

18:17.634 --> 18:20.267
(laughing)

18:23.867 --> 18:25.400
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, move over.

18:25.467 --> 18:26.734
Taylor, why don't you
just sit over...?

18:26.801 --> 18:28.034
Ryan, don't worry.

18:28.100 --> 18:29.767
It doesn't mean we're
boyfriend and girlfriend.

18:29.834 --> 18:31.801
I have huge news.
Yeah, well, me, too.

18:31.867 --> 18:33.867
Sandy and Kirsten are divorced
and she and Jimmy are married.

18:33.934 --> 18:35.801
Ew, yikes, that is huge.

18:35.867 --> 18:37.233
I can beat it, though.

18:37.300 --> 18:39.400
Sandy Cohen
is married to Julie.

18:39.467 --> 18:41.734
What?
And she's having
an affair with Che.

18:41.801 --> 18:43.467
Whoa.
Okay, all right,

18:43.534 --> 18:46.867
so this means we need
to get Sandy and Kirsten
back together
and Seth...

18:46.934 --> 18:48.534
Ryan, there's
something else.

18:48.601 --> 18:49.734
Yeah, what else?
Um...

18:53.567 --> 18:55.968
In this world, Marissa's alive.

18:56.034 --> 18:58.034
I was in her room
and Mima said

18:58.100 --> 19:01.068
her plane lands
at 3:00 from Berkeley.

19:02.400 --> 19:05.767
Now it seems like everyone
is going to this party
at Kirsten's, so I think

19:05.834 --> 19:08.534
that we can use
this opportunity
to reunite the Coopers
and the Cohens

19:08.601 --> 19:10.434
with their
rightful partners.
Uh, Taylor,
can you let me out?

19:10.500 --> 19:13.068
Why? Do you have to go
to the bathroom?
I haven't had to go.

19:13.133 --> 19:15.100
It seems like it's not
an issue in an alt-world.

19:15.167 --> 19:16.467
Taylor, seriously,
let me out.

19:17.734 --> 19:18.934
Are you going to the airport?

19:20.400 --> 19:22.400
Ryan, she won't even know you.

19:22.467 --> 19:24.167
It doesn't matter.

19:24.233 --> 19:25.801
Even if Marissa is fine
in this world,

19:25.867 --> 19:27.068
which, thank God she is,

19:27.133 --> 19:28.834
we need to focus on
fixing what is broken.

19:28.901 --> 19:31.867
Because that's
what's going to get us
back to the real world.

19:31.934 --> 19:33.467
But if she's alive...

19:33.534 --> 19:36.834
Then you don't want to go back?

19:42.334 --> 19:43.267
Okay.

19:43.334 --> 19:45.167
I get it.

19:45.233 --> 19:47.434
You... you got to go.

19:55.634 --> 19:56.968
Sorry.

20:05.734 --> 20:09.100
I can't believe we have to drive
to Riverside in this.

20:09.167 --> 20:10.534
Oh, no, honey,
I told you.

20:10.601 --> 20:12.233
My family only drinks
wine coolers.

20:12.300 --> 20:14.133
We're having a very
Britney Christmas, Mother.

20:14.200 --> 20:18.001
Yes, watch out.
I might put you on my lap
while we drive
out there.

20:18.068 --> 20:19.100
Oh, thank God
you're still here.

20:19.167 --> 20:20.500
Ryan and Taylor
are in a coma,

20:20.567 --> 20:21.634
but we're not
supposed to worry.

20:21.701 --> 20:22.734
What are you talking about?

20:22.801 --> 20:24.068
They fell off a ladder.

20:24.133 --> 20:25.233
But the doctor says
they're fine.

20:25.300 --> 20:26.667
We just have to wait
for them to wake up.

20:26.734 --> 20:27.867
So it's a coma light?

20:27.934 --> 20:29.267
Exactly. I have to find
Veronica Townsend.

20:29.334 --> 20:30.434
Do you know where she is?

20:30.500 --> 20:32.434
Taylor said she's
flying to Cabo tonight.

20:32.500 --> 20:33.968
But she may have
already left.

20:34.034 --> 20:35.634
I really don't
think that Veronica

20:35.701 --> 20:37.534
is going to care if
Taylor's in a bogus coma.

20:37.601 --> 20:39.334
Well, it doesn't matter.
Her daughter's in the hospital.

20:39.400 --> 20:40.968
She needs to know.
Come on, I'll drive.

20:41.034 --> 20:41.934
You don't have to.

20:42.001 --> 20:43.233
Taylor is my
responsibility.

20:43.300 --> 20:44.567
She's living in my house.
Come on.

20:44.634 --> 20:45.734
So no Riverside?

20:45.801 --> 20:46.834
Sweet.

20:47.834 --> 20:50.334
I mean, I hate comas.

20:50.400 --> 20:52.068
Let's go find Veronica.

20:57.867 --> 20:58.901
Oh, Mrs. Cohen.

20:58.968 --> 21:01.233
The EMT just came by.

21:01.300 --> 21:02.734
He found this
in his ambulance.

21:02.801 --> 21:04.400
Thought it might've fallen
out of your son's pocket.

21:04.467 --> 21:06.834
Oh, thank you.

21:06.901 --> 21:09.968
I've been talking to them
and reading to them
out loud.

21:10.034 --> 21:11.434
I know the doctor
says not to worry...

21:11.500 --> 21:13.500
I know, it's hard.

21:13.567 --> 21:14.801
But in these situations,

21:14.867 --> 21:16.100
a lot depends
on the patients

21:16.167 --> 21:18.867
healing themselves,
mentally and physically.

21:18.934 --> 21:22.767
When they finish whatever
they need to finish,
they'll wake up.

21:22.834 --> 21:25.567
Thanks.

21:59.334 --> 22:01.300
Marissa?

22:03.634 --> 22:04.634
Who are you?

22:04.701 --> 22:07.167
Uh, I'm sorry.
I thought, uh...

22:07.233 --> 22:08.434
What, you knew my sister?

22:08.500 --> 22:10.968
I thought she was coming
home from Berkeley.

22:11.034 --> 22:12.267
No, that's me.

22:12.334 --> 22:14.034
The youngest in
my freshman class.

22:14.100 --> 22:15.801
Sort of a prodigy.

22:15.867 --> 22:18.867
Uh, what... what
did you mean "knew"?

22:21.034 --> 22:22.968
She died three years ago.

22:25.133 --> 22:26.267
What?

22:26.334 --> 22:29.834
She OD'd in an alleyway
in Tijuana.

22:31.968 --> 22:36.467
Well, that's really the way
I want to start
my Christmas vacation.

22:36.534 --> 22:38.100
Wait, who are you again?

22:38.167 --> 22:40.667
No one.

22:40.734 --> 22:44.100
Oh, okay.
Well, Merry Christmas.

22:52.167 --> 22:54.434
I'm sorry.

23:01.767 --> 23:05.034
Ryan, you gave her
three more years.

23:05.101 --> 23:06.901
She got to
fall in love.

23:06.967 --> 23:07.967
She got to graduate.

23:08.034 --> 23:09.433
And then she still died.

23:09.500 --> 23:12.367
Which just means that you
weren't meant to save her.

23:12.433 --> 23:13.834
So if there's
any part of you

23:13.901 --> 23:14.967
that's still
blaming yourself

23:15.034 --> 23:16.634
for what happened,
you have to let it go.

23:16.700 --> 23:18.367
You've done so much
for everybody.

23:18.433 --> 23:20.500
Yeah, like what?
Ryan, haven't you been
paying attention?

23:20.567 --> 23:22.500
You saved the Cohens.

23:22.567 --> 23:24.567
Without you, Seth is
the next unibomber,

23:24.634 --> 23:26.600
Sandy is married
to Slutty McSlutterman,

23:26.667 --> 23:28.300
and Kirsten probably
hasn't had an orgasm

23:28.367 --> 23:29.834
in, like, a year.
Uh, all right,
all right.

23:29.901 --> 23:31.734
And if you think that I'm just
gonna let you give up,

23:31.801 --> 23:33.134
you're crazy.
Taylor, I said
all right.

23:33.201 --> 23:35.500
Oh. Oh, good.

23:35.567 --> 23:37.001
Okay.

23:39.034 --> 23:40.433
Has anyone ever
said "no" to you?

23:40.500 --> 23:42.134
Once.
And I pushed him off the roof.

23:43.300 --> 23:45.333
Kidding.

23:45.400 --> 23:46.634
Let's save the Cohens
and go home.

23:46.700 --> 23:48.467
All right.
Okay.

23:48.534 --> 23:50.367
An alternate universe?

23:50.433 --> 23:52.034
It's the only
obvious explanation.

23:52.101 --> 23:54.433
"Obvious" might not be
the word I would use.

23:54.500 --> 23:56.367
They both got knocked out
at the same time

23:56.433 --> 23:58.500
and neither is waking up.
Like Dorothy in Oz.

23:58.567 --> 24:00.667
And just like Dorothy
had to go see the wizard,

24:00.734 --> 24:02.268
they've got some mission
to accomplish

24:02.333 --> 24:03.667
before they can return.
Like what?

24:03.734 --> 24:05.367
Uh, anything.

24:05.433 --> 24:08.034
Could be like our world,
only messed up.

24:08.101 --> 24:10.201
They've got to
reset the balance.

24:10.268 --> 24:12.700
Or could be a world ruled by
giant vegetables,

24:12.767 --> 24:15.667
and they've got to topple
the vegetable despot
before they can come back.

24:15.734 --> 24:17.067
You had me till
vegetable despot.

24:17.134 --> 24:18.168
It makes perfect sense.

24:21.834 --> 24:22.867
Hello.

24:22.934 --> 24:24.168
Sandy,

24:24.234 --> 24:26.901
I think I know why Ryan
hasn't woken up.

24:32.667 --> 24:34.901
Hi.

24:34.967 --> 24:38.001
Okay, now before we can reunite everyone
with their rightful partners,

24:38.067 --> 24:39.268
we need to
prep them first.

24:39.333 --> 24:41.567
So I will take Kirsten
duty and you can...

24:41.634 --> 24:43.234
Ooh.

24:43.300 --> 24:46.001
I already told you, I'm not
going to your stupid party.

24:46.067 --> 24:47.734
Because Summer Roberts
is going to be here?

24:47.801 --> 24:49.534
Since when are you
avoiding her?

24:49.600 --> 24:51.234
Since she got engaged
to that burly ding-dong.

24:51.300 --> 24:53.067
You have fun.

24:53.134 --> 24:54.134
I'm on it.

25:00.168 --> 25:01.700
Taylor, what
are you doing?

25:01.767 --> 25:03.234
I told you not
to wear that suit.

25:03.300 --> 25:04.867
Your ass looks like
the back of a truck.

25:04.934 --> 25:06.034
Oh, my God.

25:06.101 --> 25:07.700
In alt-world, I'm a boy.

25:07.767 --> 25:09.101
Maybe I should try Pilates.

25:09.168 --> 25:11.101
They say it elongates you.
Outside.

25:11.168 --> 25:13.101
Go stand against the wall.
Go, come on.

25:13.168 --> 25:16.234
And my mom is still a bitch.

25:27.767 --> 25:29.268
Veronica.

25:29.333 --> 25:30.333
Veronica.

25:30.400 --> 25:31.867
Thank God,
we caught you.

25:31.934 --> 25:33.600
Oh, Julie, please don't tell me
you're going to Cabo, too.

25:33.667 --> 25:34.700
Veronica, you can't
go to Mexico.

25:34.767 --> 25:36.268
Taylor is in the hospital.

25:36.333 --> 25:37.101
Anorexia?

25:37.168 --> 25:38.567
No, she fell off a ladder.

25:38.634 --> 25:41.001
Oh.
The doctor says
she'll be fine,

25:41.067 --> 25:42.001
but she's not waking up.

25:42.067 --> 25:43.268
Maybe if she
heard your voice.

25:43.333 --> 25:44.400
Summer has a car
outside...

25:44.467 --> 25:45.500
I'll call from Cabo.

25:45.567 --> 25:46.967
Veronica, listen.

25:47.034 --> 25:48.734
I know you're not
the warm and fuzzy type.

25:48.801 --> 25:50.400
But it is Christmas Eve

25:50.467 --> 25:52.667
and it would mean so much
if you could be there.

25:55.367 --> 25:57.101
And if you get on
that plane right now,

25:57.168 --> 25:58.467
I'll tell security
you have a bomb.

25:59.834 --> 26:03.400
Wow, very
Jack Bauer of you.

26:04.433 --> 26:05.667
All right.

26:05.734 --> 26:07.400
All right, come on,
put this on.

26:07.467 --> 26:09.168
No, hate my life!

26:09.234 --> 26:11.700
I hate my life...!

26:11.767 --> 26:12.934
I hate my life!

26:13.001 --> 26:14.433
Yeah, no wonder Summer
doesn't like you.

26:14.500 --> 26:16.300
See?!
Even you think so.

26:16.367 --> 26:18.234
And no offense,
but it's kind of weird,

26:18.300 --> 26:20.300
you having such a vested
interest in my love life,

26:20.367 --> 26:21.834
considering I just met you
this morning.

26:21.901 --> 26:23.433
All right.

26:23.500 --> 26:24.201
You want the truth?

26:24.268 --> 26:25.600
Huh?

26:25.667 --> 26:26.634
Huh?

26:26.700 --> 26:28.268
I know the truth.

26:28.333 --> 26:29.967
You know the truth?
Yeah.

26:30.034 --> 26:33.467
I'm from an alternate universe
where your dad adopted me

26:33.534 --> 26:35.300
and you and Summer are in love.

26:35.367 --> 26:37.467
And unless I fix
things here,

26:37.534 --> 26:39.567
which means
getting your parents

26:39.634 --> 26:41.300
and you and Summer
together,

26:41.367 --> 26:42.801
I can't go home.

26:47.834 --> 26:49.467
I always knew this would happen.

26:49.534 --> 26:50.433
Doesn't surprise me.

26:50.500 --> 26:52.034
Put this on.
Okay.

26:52.101 --> 26:54.600
Now, I'm going
to tell you exactly
what you need to know
to woo Summer.

26:54.667 --> 26:57.168
<i>Have you ever heard of
a show called The Valley?</i>

27:02.067 --> 27:03.134
Hey.

27:03.201 --> 27:05.001
It's a great party, huh?
Yes.

27:05.067 --> 27:08.168
I'm so glad that the mayor
let me off so that I could come.

27:08.234 --> 27:09.367
You work for the mayor?

27:09.433 --> 27:10.667
Mm-hmm.

27:10.734 --> 27:13.001
How... well,
what's that like?

27:13.067 --> 27:17.667
Honestly, it's amazing that
anything ever gets done.

27:17.734 --> 27:20.101
What with the mayor moping
and crying all day

27:20.168 --> 27:22.001
about how he's still in love
with his ex-wife.

27:22.067 --> 27:24.500
But I probably shouldn't be
airing his dirty laundry.

27:24.567 --> 27:27.867
I mean, she must be around here
somewhere, right?

27:29.467 --> 27:31.534
Well, I better mingle.
Ta.

27:37.067 --> 27:39.134
Good, you got
a jacket from Seth.
Yeah.

27:39.201 --> 27:41.467
Did it go okay?
Great. He's going over
stalking points right now.

27:41.534 --> 27:45.001
Well, I am doing some serious
Jedi mind tricks on Kirsten.

27:45.067 --> 27:46.967
(Chester barking)

27:47.034 --> 27:48.034
RYAN:
There's couple number two.

27:48.101 --> 27:52.101
Ho-ho-ho, Merry Christmas.

27:52.168 --> 27:54.134
Oh!
That's my man.

27:54.201 --> 27:57.067
Okay, so what we need to do
is get Kirsten and Sandy

27:57.134 --> 27:59.234
and Seth and Summer alone
together for ten minutes.

27:59.300 --> 28:01.300
Which means removing
the obstacles.

28:01.367 --> 28:02.934
You take Julie,
I've got Chester.

28:03.001 --> 28:04.600
Hey, wouldn't this
actually be fun,

28:04.667 --> 28:06.400
you know, if you were actually
doing it with somebody

28:06.467 --> 28:07.500
who you wanted to date?

28:07.567 --> 28:08.667
Go.

28:08.734 --> 28:09.867
Okay, I'll stop.

28:19.400 --> 28:20.400
Hi.

28:20.467 --> 28:22.001
Good grub.

28:22.067 --> 28:23.667
Yeah.
So, listen,

28:23.734 --> 28:25.734
a red-haired lady wanted
me to give you a message.

28:25.801 --> 28:27.734
She's in
the master bathroom

28:27.801 --> 28:31.634
and she needs help
with something.

28:31.700 --> 28:33.300
A little thong removification.

28:33.367 --> 28:35.333
Charming.

28:35.400 --> 28:38.333
Well, uh, she's waiting.

28:38.400 --> 28:39.867
Hey, I have a good idea.

28:39.934 --> 28:41.667
Hmm?

28:41.734 --> 28:44.967
Why don't you come with?

28:45.034 --> 28:48.600
Wow, really tempting.
Um, I'm going to pass.

28:52.467 --> 28:53.600
Ew.

28:53.667 --> 28:54.967
Good to see you again.

28:55.034 --> 28:56.333
Thanks for coming.

28:58.600 --> 28:59.567
Hi.

28:59.634 --> 29:00.901
Hello.

29:00.967 --> 29:01.901
Hi.

29:01.967 --> 29:03.201
Do I know you?

29:03.268 --> 29:06.700
There's some guy
who wants to meet you
in the master bathroom.

29:06.767 --> 29:10.234
Something about
getting a thong on?

29:10.300 --> 29:12.667
Oh.

29:12.734 --> 29:14.001
That's charity talk.

29:14.067 --> 29:18.700
"Thong" is an acronym for
The Homeless of Newport...

29:20.034 --> 29:22.767
Go... or something.

29:25.700 --> 29:27.001
Excuse me.

29:29.433 --> 29:31.834
Just do me a favor,
and don't get caught.

29:31.901 --> 29:33.300
Mr. Mayor.
Yes?

29:33.367 --> 29:36.234
Hi, I was wondering,
do you have time for
a quick question?

29:36.300 --> 29:37.667
I'm hoping it's about
the new hospital.

29:37.734 --> 29:39.634
Because Dr. Henry Griffin
and I have some big plans.

29:39.700 --> 29:41.467
Actually, it's about
relationships.

29:41.534 --> 29:43.333
You see, you and I are kind
of in the same position,

29:43.400 --> 29:44.700
because I just broke
up with this guy,

29:44.767 --> 29:46.634
and he refuses
to move on.

29:46.700 --> 29:47.801
I'm not sure how
this applies to me.

29:47.867 --> 29:49.168
Mr. Mayor, come on.

29:49.234 --> 29:50.934
I mean, your ex-wife will
tell anyone who listens

29:51.001 --> 29:52.734
about how much she's
still in love with you.

29:52.801 --> 29:53.967
I work at
the Newport Group.

29:54.034 --> 29:55.967
And it is amazing that
anything ever gets done.

29:56.034 --> 29:57.201
Young lady, I don't know you.

29:57.268 --> 29:58.300
But I do know

29:58.367 --> 29:59.834
that this is not
an appropriate conversation.

29:59.901 --> 30:01.268
So please excuse me.

30:02.767 --> 30:05.268
Uh, mail truck.

30:06.634 --> 30:07.901
What?

30:07.967 --> 30:09.700
Uh, yeah, um...

30:09.767 --> 30:12.001
from the old days at Berkeley,

30:12.067 --> 30:13.734
when you guys
first fell in love.

30:13.801 --> 30:15.300
She won't shut up
about it.

30:15.367 --> 30:16.534
Mail truck, mail truck,
mail truck.

30:16.600 --> 30:20.201
It's just crazy, huh?
Bye.

30:24.300 --> 30:25.500
<i>SUMMER:
So, wait,</i>

30:25.567 --> 30:28.567
you're saying that you ride
horses in the valley?

30:28.634 --> 30:32.600
<i>No, no, I like plastic horses
and the show The Valley.</i>

30:32.667 --> 30:34.734
Hey, I like that show, too,

30:34.801 --> 30:36.667
and plastic horses.
What's yours' name?

30:36.734 --> 30:38.867
Uh, Princess Sparkle.

30:38.934 --> 30:41.067
Wait, no, no,
I mean Captain Oats.

30:41.134 --> 30:42.500
I just said
"Princess Sparkle,"

30:42.567 --> 30:43.834
'cause I think that's
a really cool name.

30:43.901 --> 30:46.300
No way!

30:46.367 --> 30:48.300
You are not going
to believe this.

30:50.834 --> 30:51.867
How's it going?

30:51.934 --> 30:53.600
Well, I read lips,

30:53.667 --> 30:55.201
and in the past
two minutes, the words

30:55.268 --> 30:57.700
"mail truck"
have come up nine times.

30:57.767 --> 30:59.801
We might actually
pull this off.
Mm-hmm.

30:59.867 --> 31:01.433
VERONICA:
Lots of teenage boys get lipo.

31:01.500 --> 31:02.600
It's no big deal.

31:02.667 --> 31:03.767
And stop picking
at your man girdle.

31:03.834 --> 31:05.234
But, Mom?
What?

31:05.300 --> 31:06.500
You have
something to say?

31:06.567 --> 31:08.567
No.

31:08.634 --> 31:11.834
You know what?

31:11.901 --> 31:15.067
I think it's time
I talk to her as an adult.

31:21.367 --> 31:22.767
Okay, you can do this.

31:22.834 --> 31:24.901
Do what? Eat?

31:24.967 --> 31:26.067
Well,
that's apparent.

31:26.134 --> 31:28.201
Shut up.

31:28.268 --> 31:30.268
Why do you have to be so mean?

31:30.333 --> 31:33.101
Neither he nor I
are remotely fat.

31:33.168 --> 31:35.567
We are smart and attractive,

31:35.634 --> 31:37.834
and interesting
and people like us.

31:37.901 --> 31:40.467
And we are not going to let you

31:40.534 --> 31:42.467
make us feel bad
about ourselves anymore.

31:42.534 --> 31:43.734
No?

31:43.801 --> 31:45.600
Well, I imagine the mirror
does that for you.

31:45.667 --> 31:47.934
You bitch!

31:48.001 --> 31:49.168
Oh, my God.

31:54.333 --> 31:55.433
You all right?

31:55.500 --> 31:57.734
I just can't believe
I just said that.

31:57.801 --> 31:59.734
I mean, I've been
waiting for so long.

31:59.801 --> 32:01.867
I can't believe
I finally did it.

32:01.934 --> 32:03.168
I'm proud of you.

32:03.234 --> 32:05.934
Thanks, Ryan, I...

32:06.001 --> 32:07.567
Whoa.

32:07.634 --> 32:08.667
What is it?
What's wrong?

32:08.734 --> 32:11.234
I don't know,
I ju...

32:11.300 --> 32:12.433
Do you hear something?

32:12.500 --> 32:14.433
Almost like rain?

32:16.867 --> 32:18.500
Stay here, I'll get you
a glass of water.

32:18.567 --> 32:20.234
Okay.

32:21.901 --> 32:23.300
JIMMY:
In my own house?

32:23.367 --> 32:25.168
In my own bathroom?

32:25.234 --> 32:26.600
I have to brush
my teeth in there.

32:26.667 --> 32:28.834
So do I, but I don't
use a toothbrush.

32:28.901 --> 32:30.567
(laughs):
Yeah, dawg.

32:30.634 --> 32:33.268
Oh, Julie, you haven't
changed a bit.

32:33.333 --> 32:35.168
Maybe you should learn to knock.
What's going on in here?

32:35.234 --> 32:36.634
Well, Mr. Mayor,

32:36.700 --> 32:38.467
let me just tell you what
I found your wife doing.

32:38.534 --> 32:39.500
Jimmy, don't.

32:39.567 --> 32:40.333
Whoo...

32:40.400 --> 32:41.367
Well, suffice to say,

32:41.433 --> 32:43.534
her thong was

32:43.600 --> 32:44.700
in his mouth.

32:48.034 --> 32:49.400
Shut up!

32:49.467 --> 32:51.934
Baby, it was stuck. I was only
trying to help her out.

32:52.001 --> 32:53.734
Oh, but that's what you said
with Holly.

32:53.801 --> 32:55.234
How come all these women
around you

32:55.300 --> 32:56.767
keep getting their thongs stuck?

32:56.834 --> 32:58.201
I'm starting to get suspicious.

33:03.168 --> 33:04.700
Geek, move it or lose it.

33:04.767 --> 33:08.201
Then I will lose it,
whatever it... is.

33:08.268 --> 33:09.268
Mm-hmm.

33:09.333 --> 33:12.300
All right, well,
it's your funeral.

33:12.367 --> 33:13.333
All right.

33:13.400 --> 33:15.134
(whispers):
Oh, snap.

33:17.567 --> 33:18.667
Thong emergency.

33:18.734 --> 33:19.734
(growls)

33:21.534 --> 33:23.268
That was, like, so brave.

33:23.333 --> 33:25.700
Oh, Julie, how
could you do this?

33:25.767 --> 33:26.767
Please, Sandy,

33:26.834 --> 33:28.433
we both know
our marriage is a sham.

33:28.500 --> 33:31.034
JULIE:
You only married me
so I could mastermind
your political career.

33:31.101 --> 33:33.001
What are you doing with Miss
Queen of the North over here?

33:33.067 --> 33:34.300
Don't you know?

33:34.367 --> 33:38.567
He spends all day crying
about me at the office.

33:38.634 --> 33:39.367
What are you
talking about?

33:39.433 --> 33:41.234
Everybody knows, Sandy.

33:41.300 --> 33:44.700
In the same way that everybody
knows how you go on and on

33:44.767 --> 33:46.067
about the mail truck?

33:46.134 --> 33:48.001
I never told anybody
about the mail truck.

33:48.067 --> 33:50.034
Well, not according
to her.

33:50.101 --> 33:53.101
Well, she's the girl that told
me you spend all day crying.

33:55.734 --> 33:57.500
Uh-oh.

33:57.567 --> 33:59.101
Sorry.

33:59.168 --> 34:02.400
Apparently, people don't stock
clean glasses in the alt-world.

34:04.300 --> 34:05.901
What's up?

34:05.967 --> 34:07.367
Oh, it's the street urchin.

34:07.433 --> 34:08.699
I knew not to trust him.

34:09.801 --> 34:11.234
I think you two
better start talking.

34:11.300 --> 34:12.934
Absolutely.
Taylor?

34:13.001 --> 34:14.734
Oh, don't worry.
I know exactly what to say.

34:14.801 --> 34:16.433
Okay, people,

34:16.500 --> 34:17.667
I can explain everything.

34:17.734 --> 34:18.400
(startled gasp)

34:18.467 --> 34:20.300
Sorry.

34:20.367 --> 34:21.400
What?

34:21.467 --> 34:23.101
TAYLOR:
Just feel a little dizzy.

34:23.168 --> 34:24.234
I...

34:24.300 --> 34:25.801
Oh, no.

34:25.867 --> 34:27.634
Ryan, I think I have to go.

34:27.699 --> 34:28.900
What?
What do you mean?

34:28.967 --> 34:30.900
It must be because I stood up
to my mom.

34:30.967 --> 34:32.567
That's what I was here to do.

34:32.634 --> 34:34.134
Ryan?
Yeah?

34:34.201 --> 34:35.667
You have to get everyone
together.
No.

34:35.734 --> 34:36.934
It's the only way back.

34:37.001 --> 34:38.833
RYAN:
Taylor, no,
I can't.

34:38.900 --> 34:40.067
Taylor...

34:40.134 --> 34:41.500
What?
Huh?

34:41.567 --> 34:42.734
Just hold on.

34:47.367 --> 34:49.367
Taylor?

34:59.534 --> 35:01.134
Taylor, honey?

35:01.201 --> 35:04.268
You need to be with Sandy Cohen.

35:04.333 --> 35:06.600
I'm going to get the doctor.

35:16.067 --> 35:17.433
SANDY:
So?

35:17.500 --> 35:19.433
Are you going to explain
yourself?

35:21.634 --> 35:23.201
The truth is,

35:23.268 --> 35:26.600
things the way they are now
are completely wrong.

35:26.667 --> 35:28.600
SUMMER:
Who's this random guy
we're all listening to?

35:28.667 --> 35:29.901
And why am I not drunk yet?

35:29.967 --> 35:31.268
Okay, look, none of you know me.

35:31.333 --> 35:33.433
But, uh, the truth is
that each of you saved my life

35:33.500 --> 35:34.801
just by being who you are.

35:36.201 --> 35:38.600
And right now none of you
are who you are.

35:39.967 --> 35:42.101
Like Summer, for example.
What are you doing?

35:42.168 --> 35:43.734
What?

35:43.801 --> 35:46.034
I mean, Che, Chester, he's, he's
completely wrong for you.

35:46.101 --> 35:47.101
You should be with Seth.

35:49.500 --> 35:52.433
Kirsten, all right, you don't
want to run the Newport Group.

35:52.500 --> 35:53.600
That place makes you miserable.

35:53.667 --> 35:55.134
And you may like your
Chardonnay, but

35:55.201 --> 35:58.234
I got news for you, it doesn't
like you back, and Sandy,

35:58.300 --> 35:59.667
you don't want
to be mayor.

35:59.734 --> 36:01.967
You're all about saving the
little guy, not holing up

36:02.034 --> 36:04.367
in some mansion,
giving orders.

36:04.433 --> 36:06.467
What you two are best at is
being married to each other.

36:13.534 --> 36:14.700
There he is.

36:14.767 --> 36:15.834
Get him out
of here.

36:17.168 --> 36:18.700
Um, okay,
before I go,

36:18.767 --> 36:22.268
Sandy, Kirsten, Seth and Summer,
promise me you'll be together.

36:24.567 --> 36:26.700
KIRSTEN:
Hey, Veronica, good news.

36:26.767 --> 36:29.667
Taylor's awake, and the doctor
said she's going to be fine.

36:29.734 --> 36:31.534
I stay home from Cabo
and she's fine?

36:31.600 --> 36:33.367
Hi, Mom.

36:33.433 --> 36:34.867
And you're walking even?

36:34.934 --> 36:36.400
Geez.
Veronica, your daughter is okay.

36:36.467 --> 36:38.034
You should be happy.

36:38.101 --> 36:40.534
Oh, Julie, it's okay, I got it.
Mom, why don't you go to

36:40.600 --> 36:42.934
the airport? I bet you could
catch the last flight to Cabo.

36:43.001 --> 36:45.600
Well, I guess
I could still make it,

36:45.667 --> 36:48.634
but I'll probably
have to fly coach.

36:48.700 --> 36:50.801
Merry Christmas, Mom.

36:56.333 --> 36:58.034
Yeah.

37:04.134 --> 37:05.300
You okay?

37:05.367 --> 37:06.867
Yeah.

37:06.934 --> 37:10.500
I don't know why,
but I feel just fine.

37:12.001 --> 37:14.001
Huh.

37:19.867 --> 37:21.367
Julie?

37:21.433 --> 37:24.001
Hmm?

37:24.067 --> 37:26.201
You should see this.

37:26.268 --> 37:28.667
I haven't read it.

37:28.734 --> 37:31.001
Oh, my God.

37:50.500 --> 37:52.934
You, uh, you seen my hat?

37:53.001 --> 37:54.234
You threw
up in it.

37:54.300 --> 37:55.500
Right.

37:55.567 --> 37:57.734
Atwood, there's someone here

37:57.801 --> 37:59.067
to bail you out.

38:01.400 --> 38:03.333
(weary sigh)

38:11.300 --> 38:12.567
Thanks.

38:12.634 --> 38:14.867
I don't know who you are,

38:14.934 --> 38:18.067
but a lot of what you said
back at the house made sense.

38:18.134 --> 38:21.534
So why do you care so much
about getting a bunch of
strangers back together?

38:21.600 --> 38:24.201
Well, I guess I thought
it would get me back home, too.

38:24.268 --> 38:27.101
But I was wrong.
Can I ask what happened?

38:28.467 --> 38:30.433
How'd your family fall apart?

38:30.500 --> 38:34.268
Hmm.

38:34.333 --> 38:36.767
I think it all goes
back to when Marissa Cooper

38:36.834 --> 38:38.101
died three years ago.

38:38.168 --> 38:40.001
She was Jimmy and
Julie Cooper's daughter.

38:40.067 --> 38:41.001
I knew Marissa.

38:41.067 --> 38:43.400
Well, after she died,

38:43.467 --> 38:45.067
it was like
everybody got stuck.

38:47.700 --> 38:49.901
Didn't know how to say good-bye?

38:49.967 --> 38:51.767
Maybe you're right.

38:51.834 --> 38:52.867
What are you doing
for dinner?

38:52.934 --> 38:56.433
How about you come
over to the house?

38:56.500 --> 38:58.433
There's someplace
I gotta go. Thanks.

38:58.500 --> 39:00.101
You're welcome.

39:02.234 --> 39:04.034
Oh, I was just
calling you.

39:04.101 --> 39:05.834
Julie, Summer
and Kaitlin
are with Taylor.

39:05.901 --> 39:06.801
She's awake.
Oh.

39:06.867 --> 39:07.834
What'd you find out?

39:07.901 --> 39:09.433
This.

39:09.500 --> 39:10.700
It's from Marissa.

39:10.767 --> 39:12.867
She sent it to Ryan
the day she was leaving.

39:12.934 --> 39:14.333
I guess it got lost
in the mail.

39:14.400 --> 39:16.433
Oh, that's odd.

39:16.500 --> 39:18.101
Well, it's Chrismukkah;
stranger things have happened.

39:18.168 --> 39:19.300
What's it say?

39:19.367 --> 39:22.168
Well, that she had
to leave Newport.

39:22.234 --> 39:25.600
That it was the only way they
could get on with their lives.

39:25.667 --> 39:27.967
She loved him,
but she had to say good-bye.

39:30.667 --> 39:32.667
Is that food?

39:32.734 --> 39:36.001
Oh, thank God.

39:36.067 --> 39:39.201
Between you and me,
Taylor in a coma

39:39.268 --> 39:41.268
is kind of a nice break.

39:41.333 --> 39:43.467
How you doing, Julie?

39:45.867 --> 39:48.168
I'm okay. Thanks.

41:45.467 --> 41:46.901
(sighs)

41:49.300 --> 41:50.934
Ryan, are you awake?

41:51.001 --> 41:53.700
(sighs)

41:53.767 --> 41:55.268
Hi.

41:56.333 --> 41:58.067
Hi.

41:58.134 --> 42:01.667
I just had the weirdest dream.

42:01.734 --> 42:04.168
You were in it, I think.

42:04.234 --> 42:05.300
That's so funny.

42:05.367 --> 42:06.934
I think you were in my dream,
too.

42:08.268 --> 42:10.001
I can't remember what it was,
though.

42:10.067 --> 42:11.700
Huh. Me, either.

42:14.767 --> 42:18.967
I'm really glad you're here.

42:24.600 --> 42:26.101
Look, the rain stopped.

42:26.168 --> 42:27.534
Hey!

42:27.600 --> 42:30.333
Look who's back in the land
of the living.

42:31.600 --> 42:33.300
Oh, Ryan, we were
so worried about you.

42:33.367 --> 42:34.867
(Ryan sighs)

42:34.934 --> 42:36.333
Everything is going to be okay.

42:36.400 --> 42:37.700
Yeah, I know.
