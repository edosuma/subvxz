02:32.490 --> 02:35.490
My baby! My baby!

02:40.170 --> 02:42.200
Captain,
there's an open gas line.

02:42.330 --> 02:43.530
It's not safe.

02:44.640 --> 02:45.670
Theo!

02:45.940 --> 02:48.870
We are not leaving
a baby to die. Let's go!

03:26.080 --> 03:27.880
<i>...who was killed
in a tragic car accident</i>

03:28.050 --> 03:30.350
<i>last night
when the vehicle lost control,</i>

03:30.480 --> 03:31.920
<i>crashing into...</i>

05:40.310 --> 05:41.250
Theo?

05:56.060 --> 05:57.130
Theo?

06:05.900 --> 06:07.440
Theo?

06:10.020 --> 06:11.140
No, leave me alone.

06:13.610 --> 06:14.850
Angie?

08:34.390 --> 08:36.220
- Hello?
<i>- Mikaela...</i>

08:38.690 --> 08:39.720
What?

08:39.789 --> 08:41.230
Now, Mikaela, go!

08:41.559 --> 08:42.559
Sam?

09:56.700 --> 10:03.290
M-Tech’s systems
are supposedly impenetrable.

10:04.830 --> 10:10.590
But you hacked them three times
in the last six months.

10:12.380 --> 10:14.260
Sensitive stuff that you stole.

10:15.640 --> 10:19.640
Highly classified intelligence.

10:21.140 --> 10:24.140
You only get your hands
on documents like those

10:24.810 --> 10:29.230
if you know exactly where to find them.

10:35.910 --> 10:36.740
So...

10:44.500 --> 10:45.460
who’s your source?

10:59.100 --> 11:04.940
Do you know what happens
when a human body burns?

11:05.170 --> 11:06.470
Hmm?

11:06.480 --> 11:07.400
Do you?

11:08.270 --> 11:12.690
Your muscles melt first
and that exposes your nerve endings.

11:13.070 --> 11:16.410
It’s so unbearably painful that

11:17.410 --> 11:20.580
your brain goes into shock
and your heart stops,

11:20.990 --> 11:23.580
and within seconds
you’re dead as a doornail.

11:25.960 --> 11:26.920
But...

11:32.380 --> 11:36.220
Yes, this stuff keeps that shock at bay.

11:38.500 --> 11:40.570
Shh!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

11:42.553 --> 11:44.390
And you feel everything.

11:48.100 --> 11:52.770
And best of all, the best part is
that we can do it over and over again.

11:53.150 --> 11:57.570
As long as it takes,
until you start talking.

12:01.700 --> 12:03.160
Come now, come, come...

12:03.290 --> 12:05.960
Please!
Please, don't do this. Please!

12:06.400 --> 12:08.470
Please don't do this.

12:12.613 --> 12:18.470
Mikaela, listen. I’m going
to be honest with you, okay?

12:19.470 --> 12:24.310
There’s no question
of you leaving here alive, okay?

12:27.600 --> 12:32.310
The only question you need to answer
is how much pain...

12:35.860 --> 12:38.030
you’re willing to experience
before you die.

12:43.366 --> 12:45.120
Okay. Hey!

12:45.330 --> 12:48.960
Samuel Isaacs.
He worked for M-Tech in the '90s,

12:49.160 --> 12:52.040
doing research
and development out of Joburg.

12:52.250 --> 12:53.750
He’s the one that wants
to expose everything,

12:54.290 --> 12:55.670
the one we’ve been looking for all along.

12:56.800 --> 12:57.800
<i>Where’s he now?</i>

12:58.800 --> 13:01.090
We’re on his trail.

13:01.640 --> 13:05.010
<i>Jesus, Ernst, I thought you had him.
What does he have?</i>

13:06.180 --> 13:11.350
Enough. Doesn’t matter.
He won’t have a chance to use it.

13:22.200 --> 13:23.280
Wes...

13:23.820 --> 13:26.450
eat your breakfast.
Otherwise you’ll be late for school.

13:26.950 --> 13:27.910
I don’t mind.

13:51.520 --> 13:53.560
Just give me the money,
that’s way easier, isn’t it?

13:53.940 --> 13:56.270
That’s not how it works, Wesley,
and you know it.

13:56.570 --> 13:59.110
Come on, Mommy,
I know the Tooth Fairy is a hoax.

13:59.530 --> 14:00.360
Says who?

14:00.650 --> 14:04.620
Says everyone and if she’s real,
where was she last night?

14:10.500 --> 14:11.750
Maybe she’ll come tonight.

14:13.170 --> 14:14.830
I’m too old for that stuff.

14:20.010 --> 14:22.670
I mean, a real Tooth Fairy would be fair,

14:23.180 --> 14:26.430
and leave at least R20 for a tooth.
R5 is peanuts.

14:26.680 --> 14:29.060
Hello? Are you saying
the Tooth Fairy is stingy?

14:29.390 --> 14:31.060
No, I’m saying you are.

14:31.560 --> 14:34.900
- Wesley, go brush your teeth.
- Already done.

14:49.080 --> 14:50.290
Please, drop it now, Angie.

14:52.450 --> 14:54.120
Not all of us can afford that attitude.

14:59.960 --> 15:03.090
- Be good, my baby.
- I always am.

15:03.300 --> 15:07.260
I know, that’s why you’re my number one,
my champ.

15:07.580 --> 15:08.610
Hmm?

15:15.350 --> 15:18.400
Do you know who just popped in
while you were in the bathroom?

15:19.650 --> 15:22.070
Do you? The Tooth Fairy.

15:23.360 --> 15:26.700
- Don’t spend it all at once, okay?
- I can’t make any promises.

15:30.530 --> 15:31.490
Let’s go.

15:36.040 --> 15:36.920
Theo...

15:41.090 --> 15:42.250
good luck today.

16:02.230 --> 16:05.000
Okay. Yeah?

16:08.770 --> 16:11.480
Eddie, I'm gonna call you back
in a minute.

16:15.480 --> 16:18.750
Theo Abrams.

16:19.920 --> 16:20.890
You look like shit.

16:21.250 --> 16:22.990
You got fat.

16:24.060 --> 16:25.060
Bloody hell.

16:26.520 --> 16:29.460
- I've missed you.
- I've missed you too, man.

16:30.360 --> 16:32.100
Looks like you're managing
just fine without me.

16:32.260 --> 16:33.400
Eh...

16:36.070 --> 16:37.600
I, um...

16:38.270 --> 16:39.500
I just saw two trucks
heading into town.

16:39.840 --> 16:42.870
Yeah. Flare-up on the mountain,
so we're relief support.

16:43.040 --> 16:44.340
Did you say howzit to the guys?

16:45.580 --> 16:46.640
Hmm.

16:48.210 --> 16:50.850
How are things?

16:55.450 --> 16:56.860
I'm good. I'm fine.

16:57.860 --> 17:00.830
I, uh, took the time off
as I was asked.

17:01.430 --> 17:02.760
But now I'm ready to come back.

17:03.730 --> 17:06.300
You know my hands are tied
until psych clears you.

17:06.460 --> 17:08.930
Ugh, come on, Moses,
you know I don't need a shrink.

17:10.069 --> 17:11.869
You still getting
those blackouts?

17:13.970 --> 17:14.940
I'm fine.

17:15.839 --> 17:17.040
What does Angie think?

17:23.480 --> 17:25.650
You're not gonna
wanna hear this.

17:26.619 --> 17:30.790
But I've been asked to find
a permanent replacement for you.

17:31.620 --> 17:34.390
The District Chief's
been informed that you're...

17:36.690 --> 17:37.730
you're resisting treatment.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.500
Yes, because it's a fucking
waste of time, Moses.

17:39.630 --> 17:41.870
It's not weak to ask for help.

17:43.130 --> 17:44.700
How many times
have we seen this?

17:45.270 --> 17:46.470
Guys who'd rather sit back

17:46.600 --> 17:48.570
and watch their lives
fall apart

17:48.740 --> 17:50.670
instead of getting the help
that they need.

17:52.040 --> 17:54.350
We soldier on, even though
we know we shouldn't.

17:54.510 --> 17:57.980
Now, ask yourself,
how does it always end up?

18:05.890 --> 18:07.660
If you're as fine
as you say you are...

18:09.330 --> 18:11.030
then get the doc
to give you your clearance.

18:11.960 --> 18:14.830
Theo! We have
a civic responsibility

18:14.970 --> 18:17.530
to ensure our ability
to help others.

18:18.400 --> 18:21.270
How am I, how is anyone
supposed to help you

18:21.410 --> 18:22.910
if you won't help yourself?

18:23.980 --> 18:26.180
It's good to see you too.

18:26.740 --> 18:27.650
Chief.

18:43.350 --> 18:44.560
Hello, this is Angela Abrams.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.480
- Hello?
- Can I speak to Theo Abrams?

18:50.150 --> 18:52.820
Sorry, you just missed him.
He left his phone at home.

18:53.030 --> 18:54.860
- Can I take a message?
<i>- When will he be back?</i>

18:56.320 --> 18:57.370
I’m not sure.

18:59.540 --> 19:00.990
Anything I can help you with?

19:03.790 --> 19:05.250
<i>- Hello?
- You’re a journalist</i>

19:06.210 --> 19:07.460
for the Cape Atlantic.

19:07.670 --> 19:10.090
That’s right. To whom am I speaking?

19:11.050 --> 19:14.090
A friend. I have a lead for you.

19:14.470 --> 19:16.260
<i>- It involves your husband.
</i>- What about him?

19:17.050 --> 19:21.890
<i>He needs our help, Angela.
Can you and I meet? It’s urgent.</i>

19:22.640 --> 19:24.810
Okay, take down my email address,
then we can...

19:25.020 --> 19:28.520
We don’t have that kind of time.
You have to trust me.

19:29.110 --> 19:32.940
<i>Meet me at 11:00 a.m., Pier place,
on Adderley, and come alone, right?</i>

19:34.110 --> 19:36.780
- Your husband’s life depends on it.
- Who the hell are you?

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
I’m glad you phoned me, Theo. Thank you.

19:51.710 --> 19:55.470
I should be thanking you, Doc.
I know it’s short notice.

19:57.090 --> 19:58.140
How are you?

20:01.260 --> 20:02.760
How are things at home?

20:09.270 --> 20:11.150
The last time I saw you, you were ashamed,

20:12.320 --> 20:16.490
because you felt
you didn’t deserve to live,

20:17.070 --> 20:18.910
that you should have died in that fire.

20:20.240 --> 20:21.410
I know what I said.

20:23.160 --> 20:24.750
That’s why I lost my job, isn’t it?

20:27.040 --> 20:28.540
Do you still feel that way?

20:30.080 --> 20:30.960
What do you think?

20:32.540 --> 20:33.750
I think you’re here...

20:35.090 --> 20:36.590
and that’s a good start, at least.

20:43.760 --> 20:45.770
You know how this works, Theo.

20:47.390 --> 20:51.060
The computer sends signals to your brain
that stimulate your subconscious.

20:52.990 --> 20:53.990
Okay?

20:56.780 --> 20:58.610
The sensors do all the work.

20:59.490 --> 21:02.070
All you need to do is relax. Okay?

21:20.390 --> 21:26.060
Theo. Breathe. You’re safe, I’m here.

21:27.270 --> 21:31.060
You’re safe.
You have to relive this trauma.

21:32.651 --> 21:35.520
That way, over time, your brain
can minimize the emotional pain.

21:36.070 --> 21:37.610
Then we can manage it.

21:39.360 --> 21:41.610
But it won’t work if you fight against it.

21:42.660 --> 21:44.120
Trust my process, Theo.

22:03.470 --> 22:04.850
Let’s go this way.

22:12.480 --> 22:13.560
Sir,

22:14.100 --> 22:16.940
I hate cloak-and-dagger stuff like this.
And once someone threatens my family...

22:17.270 --> 22:19.940
Listen, Angela. You can trust me.

22:20.860 --> 22:23.780
Your husband needs my help,
and I need yours, so...

22:25.280 --> 22:26.240
So, take a seat.

22:28.700 --> 22:29.620
Please?

22:38.420 --> 22:39.340
Who are you?

22:39.550 --> 22:43.010
My name is Sam.
I’ll get straight to the point.

22:44.840 --> 22:47.930
I have proof
of a huge government conspiracy.

22:48.140 --> 22:50.640
I’m talking about
the higher ups’ higher ups.

22:51.310 --> 22:55.150
- You’re familiar with M-Tech?
- An army contractor?

22:55.440 --> 22:57.940
Not a contractor, the contractor.

22:59.020 --> 23:01.030
Murder, treason, you name it.

23:01.240 --> 23:04.950
And they’ll do anything to stop me,
because I have proof.

23:05.160 --> 23:06.240
And I’m at the end of my rope.

23:08.580 --> 23:13.160
But we shouldn’t actually be talking here.
It’s not safe here.

23:13.710 --> 23:16.460
- What’s your ETA?
- We’re almost there.

23:16.750 --> 23:18.210
Do not lose them.

23:19.290 --> 23:22.710
Please, start from the beginning.
You said my husband’s life is in danger.

23:22.920 --> 23:26.840
Yes. A long time ago, I worked for M-Tech.
Research and development.

23:27.720 --> 23:29.600
The things I saw during those two years.

23:29.810 --> 23:33.060
Some people will do anything in the name
of national security.

23:33.270 --> 23:35.810
I’m talking about assassinations,
biological weapons,

23:36.020 --> 23:37.350
extreme defense initiatives.

23:37.560 --> 23:39.230
The type of stuff that would give
you nightmares.

23:40.070 --> 23:42.900
Fourteen years. That’s how long
I’ve been trying to expose them,

23:43.110 --> 23:45.070
but they’re always one step ahead of me.

23:45.280 --> 23:48.240
Last night.
They killed my partner last night.

23:48.700 --> 23:49.700
What?

23:52.290 --> 23:55.830
The woman who was helping me
find the classified documents.

24:01.210 --> 24:02.880
The last thing she gave me, right?

24:03.130 --> 24:06.050
Is a list with a bunch
of detailed profiles

24:06.260 --> 24:08.260
of people all across Africa.

24:08.720 --> 24:11.050
They’re seemingly unconnected,
except for this,

24:11.260 --> 24:13.020
they’re either dead, or in jail.

24:13.600 --> 24:15.930
Your husband’s name is on
that list, Angela,

24:16.140 --> 24:18.230
and I promise you, it’s not a mistake.

24:20.440 --> 24:23.400
Our time’s up. Check out that black BM,
they’re looking for me.

24:24.480 --> 24:27.490
Listen, I haven’t been able to work out
the connection with your husband,

24:27.700 --> 24:31.450
but only 11 of the people on that list
are in the Cape and he’s one of them.

24:31.660 --> 24:35.370
I’ve tried contacting the rest.
Two are behind bars,

24:35.700 --> 24:36.660
three are already dead,

24:36.870 --> 24:39.370
and the others have just disappeared.
Your husband is a target.

24:39.580 --> 24:41.590
Why and for what reason, I don’t know.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.170
All I ask of you now, Angela,
is to trust me.

25:27.700 --> 25:28.930
Daddy?

25:30.220 --> 25:32.760
Wesley, shouldn’t you be in bed?

25:33.600 --> 25:34.470
Where’s mommy?

25:41.095 --> 25:44.730
Okay, mommy will be here soon, okay?
Okay?

25:45.690 --> 25:48.070
Come on, go back to bed.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.300
<i>Hi,
you've reached Angela Abrams,</i>

26:00.430 --> 26:02.170
<i>please leave a message
and I'll get back to you.</i>

26:04.814 --> 26:07.750
Angie, it’s me again. Where are you?

26:09.130 --> 26:11.260
Let me know where you are, please.
It’s getting late.

26:46.710 --> 26:49.300
- You scared me!
- What are you busy with, Angie?

26:50.090 --> 26:53.550
- Hi, Theo.
- Hi. Where were you?

26:54.130 --> 26:56.850
- I had something important to do.
- Angie, I’ve been phoning you all day,

26:57.470 --> 26:59.470
but apparently my own wife
doesn’t answer my calls.

27:02.630 --> 27:03.530
Angie?

27:05.160 --> 27:06.100
Angie?

27:08.570 --> 27:10.730
Angie? What are you doing?

27:14.660 --> 27:18.030
- Where’s Wesley?
- Wesley’s sleeping, has been for ages.

27:21.370 --> 27:22.450
Angie, where were you?

27:26.540 --> 27:30.050
And what are you putting in that box?
Angie!

27:34.380 --> 27:35.300
Come.

27:38.390 --> 27:42.350
I got a call this morning.
He was actually looking for you.

27:43.020 --> 27:44.430
To let you know your life is in danger.

27:45.810 --> 27:46.690
What?

27:47.730 --> 27:50.320
He asked to meet with me,
so I went to see him.

27:51.780 --> 27:55.030
Wait, wait, who? What’s his name?

27:55.700 --> 27:58.740
Sam. Samuel Isaacs. He worked
for M-Tech a long time ago.

27:59.320 --> 28:02.200
Samuel... What is M-Tech?

28:02.540 --> 28:06.500
The big defense contractor.
Sam showed me a file, Theo.

28:06.710 --> 28:09.170
The file that M-Tech has on you
is full of personal info.

28:10.380 --> 28:11.800
Okay, like what?

28:12.090 --> 28:14.300
Your whole life, our life, it’s all there.

28:14.510 --> 28:17.010
Inside the metadata of an account
that’s linked to M-Tech.

28:18.470 --> 28:20.600
I don’t understand what you’re telling me.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.760
I’m still trying
to process everything myself.

28:23.270 --> 28:26.640
That metadata has the same kind
of info on 463 people.

28:26.850 --> 28:30.020
People with no connection to one another,
completely random, except...

28:30.230 --> 28:31.230
Except what?

28:32.070 --> 28:33.940
About half the people are either dead...

28:35.360 --> 28:36.400
or in jail.

28:38.530 --> 28:41.120
Okay. For what?

28:42.160 --> 28:43.120
Murder.

28:44.870 --> 28:47.750
Attempted murder.
It’s not always the same.

28:51.080 --> 28:53.460
Sam thinks it’s linked to a program
at M-Tech.

28:53.880 --> 28:55.590
Something to do with assassinations.

28:56.220 --> 28:59.760
If it’s true, it’s beyond horrifying.
And a massive story,

28:59.970 --> 29:03.680
so I’m preparing to publish all of it,
the government will have to investigate.

29:04.310 --> 29:06.520
- To me, the whole sounds...
- Totally crazy,

29:06.730 --> 29:07.890
- yes.
- Yes.

29:08.730 --> 29:09.980
I know, Theo, but I saw the evidence
Sam has.

29:10.270 --> 29:12.520
He used to work for M-Tech
and he has solid inside info.

29:12.730 --> 29:15.650
Names, accounts, testimonies.
It’s all there.

29:15.860 --> 29:18.200
It points to a conspiracy
at the highest levels.

29:18.400 --> 29:19.450
And if we don’t do something now...

29:19.700 --> 29:22.780
What does this whole thing have to do
with me? I mean, I...

29:23.830 --> 29:24.790
I don’t know yet.

29:26.330 --> 29:28.910
Okay, Angie, what if all of this is just
a bunch of nonsense?

29:30.000 --> 29:31.830
What if this is just some crazy guy...

29:32.040 --> 29:34.340
Of course,
that was my first thought, Theo.

29:34.550 --> 29:35.880
But what about the alternative?

29:36.420 --> 29:38.090
- Okay, what’s the alternative?
- What if all of it’s true,

29:38.300 --> 29:39.420
and they come looking for you?

29:43.470 --> 29:46.180
Theo, just go take a shower,
then we can talk, once you’re sober.

29:46.430 --> 29:47.850
Angie, Angie, Angie.

29:49.633 --> 29:51.350
Don’t be judgmental, please.

29:51.560 --> 29:54.110
All right? You’re not the one
that lost their job today, I am.

29:54.650 --> 29:56.570
I lost my job, not you. Right?

29:56.780 --> 29:58.070
After I was forced to see
the psychiatrist...

29:58.280 --> 29:59.700
- Forced?
- I was forced, Angie.

29:59.900 --> 30:01.820
Theo, your PTSD
is only getting worse, I can tell.

30:02.030 --> 30:03.700
- Oh, my PTSD, is that right?
- Every night it’s more nightmares

30:03.910 --> 30:05.160
- and more blackouts.
- Yes, yes...

30:05.370 --> 30:06.700
The guys want you to open up
about what happened...

30:06.870 --> 30:08.000
- Oh, the guys...
- Talk, so that you can heal

30:08.200 --> 30:09.290
and be my husband again!

30:09.500 --> 30:11.210
I am your husband,
and I’m standing right in front of you.

30:11.330 --> 30:12.670
- No, no, Theo, you’re not.
- Where am I then?

30:12.880 --> 30:14.670
I’m all alone
and you’re drinking the day away.

30:14.880 --> 30:17.050
- Like that’s an original solution.
- Oh, I drink the day away?

30:17.250 --> 30:18.760
I do nothing but drink?

30:18.960 --> 30:22.010
- Yes, Theo!
- Fuck you! Yes, fuck you!

30:31.520 --> 30:32.480
Mommy?

30:32.670 --> 30:33.700
Mm-hmm?

30:34.230 --> 30:35.560
Are you and daddy getting divorced?

30:36.860 --> 30:37.980
Of course not, my dear.

30:38.980 --> 30:42.700
Adults argue sometimes,
but we still love each other.

30:43.490 --> 30:44.530
And you.

30:45.370 --> 30:46.910
Why is daddy always so angry?

30:50.290 --> 30:52.460
Your dad is going through
a very tough time, Wes.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.130
But he’s doing his best.

30:57.710 --> 30:58.670
Close your eyes now.

31:04.220 --> 31:05.180
I love you.

31:19.730 --> 31:20.900
Angie, I’m sorry.

31:23.110 --> 31:24.200
I didn’t mean it.

31:26.870 --> 31:28.330
You have to believe me, please.

31:32.040 --> 31:33.040
Trust me.

31:36.750 --> 31:38.500
Do you even trust yourself, Theo?

32:40.430 --> 32:42.470
<i>We are not
leaving a baby to die.</i>

33:08.130 --> 33:09.300
You’re up early, Angie.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.000
Angie?

33:24.110 --> 33:25.080
Angie?

33:31.680 --> 33:32.720
Angie!

33:37.920 --> 33:40.720
Come on, Angie,
come on, come on! No! No!

33:41.230 --> 33:42.790
No!

33:47.900 --> 33:50.700
No!

34:27.370 --> 34:28.570
Daddy?

34:37.449 --> 34:39.050
Hey. Hey.

34:45.103 --> 34:47.150
Police! Open the door!

34:50.780 --> 34:52.400
Open this door immediately!

34:53.110 --> 34:54.070
Police!

34:59.870 --> 35:00.910
Open up!

35:05.380 --> 35:06.340
Where’s your wife?

35:12.130 --> 35:13.340
Stay where you are.

35:13.930 --> 35:15.010
Step away from that child.

35:15.470 --> 35:18.220
I’m going to tell you one more time,
get away from that child! Now!

35:18.560 --> 35:19.560
He killed his wife.

35:20.270 --> 35:22.060
Give me the child. Let go of the child!

35:22.520 --> 35:23.480
Give the child to me.

35:23.690 --> 35:24.980
- Leave the child alone!
- Let go of me!

35:27.860 --> 35:31.690
You are arrested on murder charges.
You have the right to remain silent.

35:31.900 --> 35:34.610
Anything you say
can be used against you...

35:59.560 --> 36:00.700
Mr. Abrams?

36:02.100 --> 36:03.600
I am Detective Williamson.

36:06.670 --> 36:08.210
Can you tell me what happened?

36:12.140 --> 36:13.480
Mr. Abrams.

36:17.950 --> 36:20.740
I don’t know, I... I can’t...

36:22.040 --> 36:24.620
- Where’s my son?
- He’s speaking to another detective.

36:26.460 --> 36:27.750
Is there anyone we can contact?

36:32.050 --> 36:34.010
Wesley,
everything will be all right, okay?

36:35.130 --> 36:37.470
Don’t worry.
Everything will be all right, Wesley.

36:39.430 --> 36:40.390
Where’s he going?

36:41.470 --> 36:43.220
- Where are you taking him?
- Mr. Abrams...

36:56.900 --> 36:59.240
I didn’t do it. I didn’t do anything.

37:00.160 --> 37:01.990
I’d never hurt my Angie,
you have to believe me.

37:02.200 --> 37:06.000
I’d never hurt Angie, please.
You have to believe me!

37:06.370 --> 37:08.620
Why would I hurt Angie? I love her.

37:08.960 --> 37:11.500
I love Angie, please. Please.

37:13.240 --> 37:14.170
Please.

38:40.530 --> 38:41.730
Psst.

38:48.776 --> 38:50.060
No, hey, no!

38:50.270 --> 38:51.800
No, hey, no!

38:52.370 --> 38:54.870
Help!

39:01.750 --> 39:04.350
Help!

39:23.770 --> 39:25.240
Jack!

40:14.690 --> 40:17.900
Stand back! Stand back! Stop moving!
Hands in the air!

40:18.560 --> 40:20.320
Hands behind your head!
Stay where you are!

40:50.720 --> 40:52.760
I want an APB
across all channels.

40:52.890 --> 40:54.190
I want units
patrolling every hospital,

40:54.330 --> 40:56.090
every clinic in the area,
because if he's injured,

40:56.230 --> 40:57.700
he's going to need
medical attention.

40:57.830 --> 40:59.830
Lock a perimeter
around the city.

41:01.770 --> 41:03.000
How the hell did that happen?

41:45.680 --> 41:46.810
<i>Theodore Abrams.</i>

41:47.250 --> 41:49.910
Deputy Station Commander
at Salt River fire station.

41:50.320 --> 41:51.820
Now, we received
a tip-off this morning

41:51.950 --> 41:54.250
about some suspected
domestic violence at his home.

41:54.750 --> 41:55.790
When our units arrived,

41:56.290 --> 41:57.990
we found his wife
has been murdered.

41:58.720 --> 42:00.120
Theo was arrested
as a prime suspect,

42:00.260 --> 42:01.730
but he has
since escaped custody,

42:01.860 --> 42:03.090
killing four of our men.

42:03.290 --> 42:05.360
And one more person,
who was in police custody.

42:05.960 --> 42:08.730
Now, the man is considered
to be armed and dangerous.

42:09.230 --> 42:10.970
Not only is he
the deputy station commander,

42:11.100 --> 42:13.710
but he's trained
in emergency operations,

42:13.840 --> 42:14.910
search and rescue.

42:15.140 --> 42:17.740
He's done three years
with the SANDF fire academy

42:17.880 --> 42:18.980
and he volunteers,

42:19.210 --> 42:21.310
self-defense training
in some of our own units.

42:21.710 --> 42:23.720
The man is an impressive target.

42:24.120 --> 42:26.080
On any other day,
we'd be celebrating him.

42:26.150 --> 42:29.530
How are we going to approach
this thing? No, sit, sit, sit, sit.

42:29.740 --> 42:31.610
General Shard, I didn’t think you would...

42:31.820 --> 42:33.200
Relax, Williamson, relax.

42:34.580 --> 42:38.500
Mike Richards and Julian Tsepe
were two of my captains.

42:39.540 --> 42:40.580
I’m doing this for them.

42:42.330 --> 42:44.880
I understand the victim
was a journalist, yes?

42:45.540 --> 42:48.260
Yes, the online reporter
for the Cape Atlantic.

42:49.840 --> 42:53.470
That means the media will want
to ride this thing, long and hard.

42:54.550 --> 42:56.180
We have to keep them at a distance.

43:16.700 --> 43:18.070
Hello, Captain.

43:19.100 --> 43:20.370
I heard
you popped by yesterday.

43:20.510 --> 43:23.010
- Didn't even come and say hi?
- Sorry, man, I, uh...

43:24.310 --> 43:25.740
You guys looking after
Archie for me?

43:25.940 --> 43:27.250
It's us that need looking after,

43:27.380 --> 43:29.550
you must see
the man's latest squeeze, Cap.

43:29.680 --> 43:31.480
A granny from Crawford.

43:32.720 --> 43:34.150
I told you,
she didn't even look 50.

43:34.290 --> 43:35.690
And it's Rondebosch East.

43:36.720 --> 43:38.420
Anyway, you back, or what, Cap?

43:38.600 --> 43:41.140
No, I...

43:42.600 --> 43:44.060
I’m going to have a quick chat
with the Chief, okay?

43:44.270 --> 43:46.020
See you guys later, okay?

43:46.530 --> 43:48.500
You know, your mom
never really loved you, huh?

43:48.700 --> 43:49.600
Bro, what the hell?

43:49.730 --> 43:51.100
Talking about my squeeze
looks 50,

43:51.240 --> 43:52.700
- you mad?
- Hey, hey!

44:00.980 --> 44:03.450
Theo, what the hell happened?

44:05.320 --> 44:06.120
Car accident.

44:06.320 --> 44:08.150
Tobie, please give me a minute.

44:08.350 --> 44:09.320
Yeah.

44:09.340 --> 44:12.050
One of his neighbors phoned
this morning, anonymously.

44:12.260 --> 44:14.880
Apparently he heard
the woman screaming, around 6:45.

44:15.180 --> 44:16.800
Two of our units were sent out
to the house.

44:17.180 --> 44:20.220
- Where’s the coroner’s report?
- We’re still waiting.

44:20.760 --> 44:23.310
But she was clearly strangled,
it’s asphyxiation.

44:23.520 --> 44:24.690
Is that your expert opinion?

44:25.810 --> 44:28.400
- General, it’s a slam-dunk case.
- It’s a manhunt.

44:28.690 --> 44:31.980
Every little mistake we make now
leads to another murder.

44:32.900 --> 44:35.360
From now on, all leads are to be reported
to me directly.

44:39.780 --> 44:42.420
You have got
to tell me what's going on.

44:42.750 --> 44:44.390
I can't help you

44:44.560 --> 44:46.520
if you don't tell me
what's going on.

44:47.790 --> 44:48.730
Trust me...

44:51.030 --> 44:52.300
It's better if you don't know.

44:53.260 --> 44:55.700
<i>...the Pretorius street area</i>

44:55.830 --> 44:57.270
<i>around ten o'clock

44:57.400 --> 45:00.200
<i>Theo Abrams is considered
armed and dangerous.</i>

45:00.340 --> 45:01.510

<i>- Wanted</i>

45:16.400 --> 45:17.360
What’s wrong?

45:28.230 --> 45:29.400
Wait.

45:30.370 --> 45:32.240
What the hell are you doing
with a gun, Theo?

45:32.870 --> 45:34.340
I...

45:38.540 --> 45:40.980
Moses, stop. Moses.
Please, stop.

45:41.150 --> 45:43.250
What is going on?

45:44.350 --> 45:45.750
Someone tried to kill me, Moses.

45:47.150 --> 45:48.390
Call that crime hotline.

45:50.150 --> 45:51.960
<i>What do you mean,
someone tried to kill you?</i>

45:52.120 --> 45:53.760
Theo, talk to me, please.

46:00.870 --> 46:01.870
Hey!

46:06.840 --> 46:08.410
No one needs to know about this.

46:08.610 --> 46:10.640
- We can call Angie...
- Angie's dead, Moses!

46:11.580 --> 46:12.510
She's dead!

46:19.150 --> 46:21.390
I had no choice!

46:23.190 --> 46:24.390
Let me help you.

46:24.520 --> 46:26.520
But first you have to
let me have the gun.

46:27.290 --> 46:29.330
- No.
- Please, give me the gun.

46:33.560 --> 46:34.730
I'm... I'm sorry.

46:54.250 --> 46:55.690
Hold it there,
hold it there, hold it there.

48:27.050 --> 48:28.450
Shit. Fuck.

50:03.880 --> 50:04.940
Hey!

50:05.940 --> 50:10.050
Hey, Moses. Hey, hey.
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

50:13.680 --> 50:16.220
It's okay. It's okay, it's okay.

50:16.790 --> 50:21.690
Hey, hey. Hang in there, okay?
You hang in there.

50:22.390 --> 50:24.060
Hey, help is here,
help is here, okay?

50:28.730 --> 50:32.370
Whoever did this,
I'm gonna find them. Okay?

50:36.240 --> 50:37.440
I'll see you soon.

51:41.000 --> 51:41.960
<i>Are you done?</i>

51:42.870 --> 51:45.330
Hey, you. Who are you?

51:47.540 --> 51:49.460
Hey, speak.

51:58.590 --> 52:01.660
141 Ferndale Road.

52:03.360 --> 52:04.960
141 Ferndale Road.

52:06.310 --> 52:08.020
The station commander
is in a critical condition,

52:08.230 --> 52:09.070
but he’s alive.

52:09.900 --> 52:11.820
This is a massacre, nothing less.

52:12.690 --> 52:14.700
We need to catch this guy today,
you hear me?

52:18.910 --> 52:22.580
Theo Abrams saved 198 people
in four years.

52:23.160 --> 52:25.250
And another 25 since he became captain.

52:26.420 --> 52:28.960
- His colleagues see him as a hero.
- So, what are you trying to say?

52:29.340 --> 52:31.510
He’s been on mandatory leave
for five months,

52:31.710 --> 52:34.090
after he lost two of his friends
in a fire.

52:34.930 --> 52:38.970
And, according to his file,
there have been two incidents at his home,

52:39.180 --> 52:42.310
apparently domestic disturbance.
And his neighbors,

52:42.680 --> 52:44.480
they say he’s been aggressive lately.

52:45.060 --> 52:46.520
They don’t know him
to usually be that way.

52:46.940 --> 52:50.480
- All since that specific fire.
- What are you getting at?

52:51.020 --> 52:52.320
It’s obvious, General.

52:53.820 --> 52:54.780
PTSD.

52:55.280 --> 52:59.320
That’s why he was on mandatory leave.
Perhaps even why he murdered his wife.

53:00.200 --> 53:01.700
General, the guys
from the fire department.

53:02.240 --> 53:06.040
They see the same horrors we do.
Probably worse.

53:06.460 --> 53:08.330
- How is that relevant?
- It is relevant,

53:08.750 --> 53:10.130
because they have to power through.

53:10.340 --> 53:12.630
Because the public relies on them,
just like the police.

53:13.420 --> 53:15.920
General, here it is, black on white.

53:16.430 --> 53:19.180
We can use it to expose
this cycle of trauma.

53:19.550 --> 53:22.010
Perhaps put systems in place to ensure...

53:22.220 --> 53:26.520
No one gives a wit about PTSD.
You should know that.

53:27.480 --> 53:29.860
The public expects the police
to protect them.

53:30.060 --> 53:32.820
They don’t want to know
that we can’t even protect ourselves.

53:33.400 --> 53:39.030
Theo Abrams is not a victim.
He’s a murderer and that’s that.

53:39.870 --> 53:41.620
I found out who his psychiatrist is.

53:44.240 --> 53:45.500
We have to go see her.

53:46.620 --> 53:48.580
Maybe she can help us figure out
what’s going on in his head.

53:48.790 --> 53:50.670
All right, all right,
make the appointment.

53:50.880 --> 53:53.050
But send out a press release.
I want Theo Abrams’ face

53:53.250 --> 53:56.510
on every TV news channel,
every radio station, on the front page.

53:56.720 --> 53:58.550
If he tweets something,
I want to know about it.

53:58.760 --> 54:00.090
This bastard isn’t going to hide from us.

54:00.340 --> 54:02.220
I thought you wanted to keep the media
at a distance, General.

54:02.600 --> 54:04.140
It’s too late for that.

54:21.830 --> 54:24.070
Excuse me, sir, can I help you?

54:24.400 --> 54:25.370
Yeah, no, I'm fine,

54:25.670 --> 54:26.700
I'm actually just visiting
a friend, that's all.

54:26.840 --> 54:27.740
All guests are required

54:27.870 --> 54:29.210
to sign in
for security purposes.

54:29.370 --> 54:30.640
This way, please.

54:32.480 --> 54:34.210
Who are you visiting today, sir?

54:34.450 --> 54:38.020
Um... I'm, uh, I...

54:39.020 --> 54:40.250
- Uh...
- Sir?

54:41.690 --> 54:43.290
Ma'am,
put down the phone.

54:43.620 --> 54:45.990
Uh, Sir, I have to call
the staff you're visiting

54:46.120 --> 54:47.620
so that he or she can come
fetch you,

54:47.760 --> 54:49.860
we don't allow
visitors in unattended.

54:49.990 --> 54:51.500
- Security...
- Okay.

54:51.630 --> 54:53.000
Put down the phone, now.

54:57.970 --> 55:02.540
So, in every way
that this ends badly for me,

55:02.670 --> 55:05.240
it ends badly for you,
do you understand? Good.

55:05.380 --> 55:06.640
Now...

55:07.850 --> 55:10.320
The security control room.
Take me there.

55:12.250 --> 55:13.250
Now.

55:18.050 --> 55:19.670
Fourteen hours ago, okay.

55:21.220 --> 55:22.380
Black BMW.

55:24.890 --> 55:25.930
Damn it.

55:29.430 --> 55:30.430
Okay.

55:35.310 --> 55:36.340
Where's that?

55:37.580 --> 55:39.710
Service entrance.

55:45.950 --> 55:49.350
There are hallway cameras. Okay.

55:54.790 --> 55:55.830
You clever bastard.

55:58.100 --> 55:59.660
This feed's on a loop.

56:00.600 --> 56:04.040
These timecodes don't add up.
Okay. Okay.

56:07.510 --> 56:09.510
I need a list of every person
living on the 16th floor

56:09.640 --> 56:10.980
for the last week. Okay?

56:11.540 --> 56:12.810
Can you get me that list?

56:13.410 --> 56:15.150
Yes? Or this ends badly for him.

56:15.280 --> 56:17.520
No, no, please, okay,
it's fine, I'll go. But, um...

56:18.020 --> 56:19.620
I need to get it
from the front desk.

56:19.750 --> 56:21.990
You have two minutes, okay?
Two minutes.

56:22.120 --> 56:23.690
And bring a master key with you,
you understand?

56:23.820 --> 56:26.120
- Okay? Go, go, go.
- Okay.

56:35.420 --> 56:38.210
I have great appreciation
and understanding for you, Doctor...

56:39.460 --> 56:42.260
as a volunteer who does so much good work

56:42.920 --> 56:45.970
with people in the public service.
Your work is highly regarded,

56:46.890 --> 56:48.470
- but...
- But some people

56:48.680 --> 56:50.260
don’t believe in the process.

56:52.310 --> 56:55.140
Do you know how many times
I’ve seen it happen?

56:55.730 --> 56:57.730
I’ve lost friends, good friends.

56:58.400 --> 57:02.690
And the problem
wasn’t a lack of support, or systems,

57:03.320 --> 57:06.450
or trauma counselling.
The problem was pride.

57:08.160 --> 57:12.290
Who wants to be seen as a weakling?
And here we have Theo Abrams now.

57:13.290 --> 57:16.420
How many more people need
to die for his pride?

57:18.040 --> 57:20.460
He’s had opportunities
for counselling, yes?

57:21.340 --> 57:22.420
And he refused.

57:23.630 --> 57:28.640
- Correct?
- Trauma isn’t rational, General.

57:29.260 --> 57:33.100
And you’re confusing pride
with shame or fear.

57:33.310 --> 57:35.060
I understand there’s much at stake, but...

57:35.270 --> 57:36.440
But the bodies are piling up.

57:38.230 --> 57:39.900
No one wants another death.

57:42.150 --> 57:43.730
Just help us find Theo.

57:50.490 --> 57:53.620
You want me to discuss a patient. It's...

57:54.490 --> 57:56.710
it’s not only unethical, it’s illegal.

57:56.960 --> 58:01.000
And if your patient kills 15 people
in cold blood?

58:01.460 --> 58:03.420
Confidentiality is nonnegotiable.

58:04.500 --> 58:08.010
Captain, you were in this chair yourself,
only recently.

58:09.590 --> 58:14.720
How would you feel if I told a stranger
your deepest, most painful secrets?

58:16.680 --> 58:21.310
With all due respect, Doctor,
Rene didn’t kill 15 people today.

58:31.880 --> 58:35.390
- Give me the key.
- Give me the key.

58:37.290 --> 58:38.360
You...

58:40.660 --> 58:43.130
It's okay, don't worry.
Hey, it's okay, don't worry.

58:43.260 --> 58:45.500
- No... no, please.
- Get in, get in. Get in.

58:48.900 --> 58:51.540
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
It's okay, it's okay.

58:54.170 --> 58:58.310
Okay. Shit.

59:39.120 --> 59:41.050
- Yes?
- Uh, sorry.

01:01:32.590 --> 01:01:34.050
<i>- What’s his name?
- Samuel Isaacs.</i>

01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:35.590
<i>He worked for M-Tech a long time ago.</i>

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:39.300
<i>I got a call this morning.
Saying your life is in danger.</i>

01:01:39.970 --> 01:01:42.140
<i>Authorities are still searching
for Theo Abrams,</i>

01:01:42.350 --> 01:01:45.060
<i>a fire fighter from Cape Town.</i>

01:01:45.350 --> 01:01:46.730
<i>Abrams leaves behind a trail of carnage</i>

01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:48.650
<i>that started with the gruesome murder
of his wife,</i>

01:01:48.850 --> 01:01:50.560
<i>the respected journalist, Angela Abrams.</i>

01:01:52.110 --> 01:01:54.280
<i>Four police officers
and nine firefighters...</i>

01:01:56.650 --> 01:01:58.820
<i>Sam thinks it’s linked to a program
at M-Tech.</i>

01:01:59.410 --> 01:02:01.200
Something to do with assassinations.

01:02:33.570 --> 01:02:35.030
Where’s the laptop? Where’s the laptop?

01:03:35.371 --> 01:03:37.090
Who the fuck are you? Who?

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:07.200
Who the fuck are you?

01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:11.410
Was it you who killed my wife
and tried to frame me?

01:04:17.250 --> 01:04:18.250
Do you work for M-Tech?

01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:27.260
Thought so, stupid bitch.

01:04:28.970 --> 01:04:30.600
I’m going to find out who’s responsible
for this.

01:04:30.970 --> 01:04:32.100
Then you’re all going to pay.

01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:41.400
Take the stairs.

01:04:57.630 --> 01:04:59.130
Out the way, get out of the way.

01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:20.820
It wasn’t me.

01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:23.860
The whole thing is a setup,
someone’s trying to frame me.

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:27.200
It doesn’t seem that way to me.
But let’s assume you’re telling the truth.

01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:31.120
Put down that weapon,
then you explain it to me.

01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:36.250
Mr. Abrams, please.
Too many people have already died today.

01:05:36.750 --> 01:05:39.750
It can end now, if you help me.
Your choice.

01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:43.420
Theo.

01:05:45.550 --> 01:05:46.760
We met at your house.

01:05:47.970 --> 01:05:50.220
I just want to tell you something.

01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:53.600
My husband shot at my daughter and I.

01:05:55.350 --> 01:05:56.350
He wanted to kill us.

01:05:57.270 --> 01:06:00.900
But he only managed that with one person,
himself.

01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:06.530
And I know. I know he’s in a better place.
And that he regrets what he did.

01:06:08.110 --> 01:06:09.160
He was a good man.

01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:12.740
He just couldn’t protect himself
from himself.

01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:17.410
But you, Theo, you can protect Wesley.

01:06:18.870 --> 01:06:20.210
All he wants is his dad.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:25.550
And if you try to flee again,
it can only end one way.

01:06:27.010 --> 01:06:28.930
What becomes of your son then?

01:06:31.050 --> 01:06:33.600
Theo, please.

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:39.140
Don’t make an orphan of him.

01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:41.980
You know all too well how that feels.

01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:57.160
Open the door!

01:06:57.370 --> 01:06:58.410
You can’t get away, open up.

01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:02.040
Theo, open up!

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:45.250
Bastard.

01:08:42.229 --> 01:08:43.229
Fuck.

01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:53.300
Could we get anything from the CCTV?

01:09:54.210 --> 01:09:57.550
All the cameras stopped working at once.
A system failure, apparently.

01:09:58.090 --> 01:09:59.090
That’s convenient.

01:09:59.930 --> 01:10:02.560
Well, at least no video of us will end up
on social media.

01:10:02.970 --> 01:10:05.480
Yes, and the guy in the elevator,
the injured one.

01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:06.690
Did he have anything to say?

01:10:07.690 --> 01:10:10.190
He has four broken ribs and a stab wound
in his leg.

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:12.320
According to him,
Abrams just attacked him.

01:10:13.820 --> 01:10:17.450
- What about this guy?
- Dead as a doornail for 12 hours already.

01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:21.990
The first thing Abrams said was
that someone is trying to frame him.

01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:24.750
That means he came here looking
for something.

01:10:25.250 --> 01:10:26.250
Proof.

01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:28.710
We have to find out who this guy is.

01:10:29.670 --> 01:10:31.130
That might tell us what Abrams
is looking for.

01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:35.340
Williamson.

01:10:35.470 --> 01:10:36.810
Hmm?

01:10:37.090 --> 01:10:38.050
Go home.

01:10:39.090 --> 01:10:41.090
What? Why?

01:10:41.430 --> 01:10:43.970
You placed yourself and a senior officer
in danger.

01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:46.600
There in the hallway earlier with Abrams.

01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:49.980
You weren’t focused on the case,
only your own agenda.

01:10:50.190 --> 01:10:52.310
I’m taking you off the case,
effective immediately.

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:54.320
General, that’s absolute bullshit.

01:10:55.730 --> 01:10:58.780
I have the best chance of anyone to solve
this case.

01:10:59.070 --> 01:11:00.110
Or fuck it up.

01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:32.100
Sussex Industries.

01:11:55.090 --> 01:11:58.340
Relax, Captain. I want to help you.

01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:10.840
Theo Abrams.
Only survivor.

01:12:13.070 --> 01:12:14.740
"Believes himself
to be responsible

01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:16.640
for his parents' deaths."

01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:20.180
Mm-hmm.

01:12:21.310 --> 01:12:25.020
"Displays extraordinary
resilience to childhood trauma."

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:55.230
- Come on, let me see.
- Leave it.

01:12:56.770 --> 01:12:57.810
Leave it.

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:06.780
I never liked that mirror.

01:13:07.570 --> 01:13:09.330
It’s always been a pain in my butt.

01:13:23.470 --> 01:13:24.970
How would I ever survive without you?

01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:30.680
You’re a survivor, T. That’s what you do.

01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:36.440
Since long before you met me.

01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:29.280
- What the fuck?
- Samuel Isaacs.

01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:30.870
The corpse at the hotel.

01:14:31.330 --> 01:14:35.410
I ran his fingerprints myself.
The guy is a freaking ghost.

01:14:35.870 --> 01:14:37.580
This is literally all we have on him.

01:14:43.250 --> 01:14:45.510
I really hope I drew the wrong conclusions
about you.

01:14:48.590 --> 01:14:49.560
Sit.

01:16:30.610 --> 01:16:31.570
<i>Where are we?</i>

01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:35.120
FRS picked him up on one
of the street cameras.

01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:38.910
- I’m on my way.
- We’re too close to the end, Ernst.

01:16:39.450 --> 01:16:41.580
Finish this thing now,
I don’t care how you do it.

01:16:53.550 --> 01:16:54.750
Colonel Marquez,

01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:56.190
thank you for meeting me
at this hour.

01:16:56.450 --> 01:16:58.760
You don't have to
thank me yet, Minister.

01:16:58.990 --> 01:17:00.090
I don't know why I'm here.

01:17:00.390 --> 01:17:01.690
Well, I'll get
straight to the point.

01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:04.060
After your president's
untimely death,

01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:07.370
China began lobbying hard
to ensure your vice-president

01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:09.930
becomes the country's successor.

01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:13.040
His loyalty to the East
is no secret.

01:17:13.810 --> 01:17:14.870
With him in power,
it will ensure

01:17:15.010 --> 01:17:17.540
their military stronghold
in the region

01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:18.680
for decades to come.

01:17:19.850 --> 01:17:23.250
But we have the opportunity
to ensure that doesn't happen.

01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:26.050
You're the strongest
opposition leader in Angola,

01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:28.190
so my question to you,
Colonel, is,

01:17:29.050 --> 01:17:31.020
do you want to be
the next president?

01:17:33.420 --> 01:17:36.230
African Union
Summit stalls...

01:17:54.850 --> 01:17:56.310
<i>My name is Samuel Isaacs,</i>

01:17:56.450 --> 01:17:59.450
<i>and this testimony relates
to an ongoing investigation</i>

01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:02.050
<i>into M-Tech,
an experimental program,</i>

01:18:02.190 --> 01:18:04.860
<i>known as Indemnity,
and its creator,</i>

01:18:04.990 --> 01:18:06.890
<i>South Africa's Minister
of Defense.</i>

01:18:07.060 --> 01:18:08.660
<i>You don't have
that kind of power.</i>

01:18:08.790 --> 01:18:09.960
What if I did?

01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:11.960
What if, together,
we and others like us

01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:14.800
- can take back this continent?
- How?

01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:17.640
<i>Back in 1996,
I was tasked with testing</i>

01:18:17.870 --> 01:18:21.370
<i>the psychical effects
of advanced psychoplasma drugs</i>

01:18:21.570 --> 01:18:22.470
<i>on volunteers,</i>

01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:25.410
<i>mostly men and some women
from the military.</i>

01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:27.980
<i>Guinea pigs
for experimental procedures</i>

01:18:28.110 --> 01:18:29.810
<i>that would supposedly
advance treatment</i>

01:18:29.950 --> 01:18:33.990
<i>of extreme post-traumatic
stress disorder, or PTSD.</i>

01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:38.260
<i>Shock therapy, coercion,
cognitive manipulation</i>

01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:40.220
<i>techniques were
routinely demonstrated</i>

01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:43.490
<i>on South African citizens
to study the body's response</i>

01:18:43.630 --> 01:18:45.560
<i>to trauma using
powerful serums.</i>

01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:48.130
<i>But what I later discovered
was that the program</i>

01:18:48.270 --> 01:18:52.340
<i>wasn't designed to treat PTSD,
but to manipulate it.</i>

01:18:52.670 --> 01:18:55.210
<i>To use it to create
unwitting soldiers</i>

01:18:55.370 --> 01:18:57.740
<i>who would obediently
take the fall for crimes</i>

01:18:57.940 --> 01:18:59.040
<i>they didn't commit,</i>

01:18:59.180 --> 01:19:02.150
<i>by forcibly rehabilitating
their memories</i>

01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:03.850
<i>with powerful medication.</i>

01:19:04.650 --> 01:19:07.250
<i>The program was tested
in various African countries</i>

01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:09.920
<i>where M-Tech had set up
training facilities,</i>

01:19:10.050 --> 01:19:12.090
<i>a front
for secret military outposts.</i>

01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:14.460
<i>Outposts that were a cover
for the planning of,</i>

01:19:14.690 --> 01:19:18.360
<i>and systematic elimination
of powerful political leaders</i>

01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:20.870
<i>on the continent,
who all had one thing in common,</i>

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:25.300
<i>interests that weren't aligned
to the politics of David Gordon.</i>

01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:29.160
We traced Samuel Isaacs’ tax number.

01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:32.540
His last official salary came
through 14 years ago.

01:19:34.420 --> 01:19:41.300
He did freelance investigative work for us
for about two years, from 2004.

01:19:44.470 --> 01:19:47.430
We do a thorough background check
on everyone.

01:19:48.020 --> 01:19:49.140
Company policy.

01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:54.570
- This guy was part of Special Forces.
- That’s why we hired him.

01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:59.530
Our best investigators are guys
with military experience.

01:20:00.070 --> 01:20:02.570
Makes them ten times better than the rest,
if you ask me.

01:20:02.990 --> 01:20:05.330
Can you remember if he ever mentioned
a Theo Abrams?

01:20:05.780 --> 01:20:09.040
He didn’t say much. Never asked questions.

01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:13.290
So we didn’t either.
Until he disappeared in 2006.

01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:15.500
Vanished off the face of the Earth,
it seems.

01:20:16.390 --> 01:20:18.190
<i>Back when I began leaking intel</i>

01:20:18.260 --> 01:20:21.060
<i>to the press,
M-Tech was investigated.</i>

01:20:21.290 --> 01:20:23.660
<i>It didn't take long
for some staff to defect</i>

01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:25.560
<i>or turn state's witness.</i>

01:20:25.700 --> 01:20:29.130
<i>But I knew better.
I resigned quietly,</i>

01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:30.400
<i>went off the grid.</i>

01:20:30.530 --> 01:20:33.600
<i>And today, I'm the only witness
still alive,</i>

01:20:34.770 --> 01:20:35.810
<i>but I needed help,</i>

01:20:36.340 --> 01:20:38.440
<i>I needed proof
of this conspiracy.</i>

01:20:39.410 --> 01:20:41.150
<i>Mikaela Morris
helped with that.</i>

01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:43.810
<i>She was an expert
at information retrieval.</i>

01:20:44.220 --> 01:20:46.620
<i>She found that M-Tech
had infiltrated</i>

01:20:46.750 --> 01:20:49.220
<i>the highest levels
of African governments.</i>

01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:53.220
<i>David Gordon has murdered
countless African leaders</i>

01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:57.330
<i>and framed unwitting suspects
using this illegal,</i>

01:20:57.460 --> 01:21:00.670
<i>experimental programme,
which itself is a violation</i>

01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:02.270
<i>of the Geneva Convention.</i>

01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:04.870
<i>The question we need
to ask ourselves is,</i>

01:21:06.170 --> 01:21:07.540
<i>to what end?</i>

01:22:38.230 --> 01:22:40.980
You made me work for my pay today, hey?

01:22:41.570 --> 01:22:45.490
But that’s okay, that’s okay,
I actually enjoyed it.

01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:47.820
Now I’m going to kill you.

01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:51.930
Get the car, I need to get to M-Tech.

01:26:52.350 --> 01:26:54.890
It's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

01:26:56.220 --> 01:26:58.120
- Kill me.
- No.

01:26:58.260 --> 01:26:59.590
- Kill me.
- No.

01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:04.660
Please. Please, kill me.
Theo, please.

01:28:25.180 --> 01:28:26.880
What exactly do I need to do?

01:28:29.250 --> 01:28:33.220
Keep the phone, It will ring
when the time is right.

01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:38.170
Did you hear? Moses Tweste passed away
in the middle of the night.

01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:41.590
Yes, it’s awful. Just yesterday,
the doctors were telling me

01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:44.800
he’s recovering well.
I was hoping to see him today.

01:28:45.890 --> 01:28:46.890
So yes.

01:28:47.970 --> 01:28:49.020
Look here.

01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:52.560
This is the hospital, close to the ward
where his bed was.

01:28:53.230 --> 01:28:55.810
The cameras stopped working.
Sounds familiar, hey?

01:28:56.900 --> 01:29:00.490
But this hospital has another generator
on a different site

01:29:00.690 --> 01:29:02.950
for things like ICU,
so the CCTV kept working.

01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:10.160
Now, only staff and family members
are allowed in here, no one else.

01:29:14.710 --> 01:29:15.880
Fucking hell.

01:29:16.670 --> 01:29:18.210
Is that the guy from the hotel elevator?

01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:21.300
- Did he murder Tweste?
- Possibly.

01:29:25.470 --> 01:29:26.740
Come again.

01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:45.220
Yes. Not registered?
Okay, thanks.

01:29:49.620 --> 01:29:54.160
The guy’s cell number is fake.
His address, too. It’s all bullshit.

01:29:57.040 --> 01:30:00.170
He’s the only one
we haven’t identified yet. Am I right?

01:30:15.190 --> 01:30:17.730
I think I’m going to vote for him,
this one, this Gordon guy.

01:30:19.020 --> 01:30:21.280
I think he’d make a good president,
even though he’s a White guy.

01:30:57.560 --> 01:30:58.560
<i>Tell me.</i>

01:30:59.100 --> 01:31:01.730
How soon after your husband’s death
did you return to work?

01:31:02.610 --> 01:31:07.910
Three miserable, unpaid weeks.

01:31:10.570 --> 01:31:15.700
Because it was suicide,
life insurance meant nothing.

01:31:16.210 --> 01:31:18.210
He took everything from you

01:31:19.250 --> 01:31:20.630
and left you with nothing.

01:31:22.380 --> 01:31:24.050
You’re trying to bribe a detective.

01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:27.170
I should lock you up.

01:31:29.380 --> 01:31:33.180
You’re welcome to,
if you’re that determined to keep losing.

01:31:35.390 --> 01:31:36.390
Wait.

01:31:52.530 --> 01:31:53.490
Yes?

01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:01.920
I have a new lead. Come on.

01:32:03.420 --> 01:32:06.340
I... I need to fetch my daughter
from home.

01:32:06.590 --> 01:32:08.590
Or school rather
and drop her off at home.

01:32:09.340 --> 01:32:11.220
I’ll phone as soon as I’m done.

01:32:31.220 --> 01:32:32.290
Theo.

01:32:33.030 --> 01:32:34.740
The internet is an amazing thing, Doc.

01:32:37.910 --> 01:32:39.660
If you search hard enough,
you can find anything.

01:32:42.620 --> 01:32:43.750
Like, for example...

01:32:45.670 --> 01:32:47.130
who developed Torvidep?

01:32:48.010 --> 01:32:49.630
The medication that’s supposed

01:32:50.220 --> 01:32:53.260
to correct PTSD patients’
chemical imbalances?

01:32:55.510 --> 01:32:58.020
Advanced psychoplasma drugs.

01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:01.770
And you were a resident
with Avark Pharmaceuticals.

01:33:03.650 --> 01:33:05.270
But that name didn’t last long.

01:33:08.230 --> 01:33:09.480
M-Tech bought out the company.

01:33:11.110 --> 01:33:14.910
Then it became Rotterscope International.

01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:17.160
And they’re the ones...

01:33:19.950 --> 01:33:21.250
who made these pills.

01:33:22.870 --> 01:33:26.080
Yes. And you helped kickstart
the Sancore Foundation.

01:33:28.170 --> 01:33:30.170
And Rotterscope is your biggest investor.

01:33:31.470 --> 01:33:34.930
But the foundation helped
offer psychological care

01:33:35.180 --> 01:33:41.430
to members of the navy, the army,
police...

01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:44.730
and firefighters.

01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:49.230
And that’s how you got access to everyone.

01:33:49.940 --> 01:33:50.900
Which computer?

01:34:01.910 --> 01:34:03.460
You gave me the pills.

01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:06.920
You messed with my head.

01:34:08.590 --> 01:34:10.630
You sent someone to my house
to kill my wife

01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:12.170
and made me believe it was me.

01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:14.260
But how?

01:34:15.130 --> 01:34:18.100
How is it possible
that I can’t remember anything?

01:34:20.260 --> 01:34:21.350
But I figured it out, Doc.

01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:27.810
It’s the pills and your hypnosis.

01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:30.520
That’s how you make us forget.

01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:35.860
Turn us into unreliable witnesses.

01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:38.160
Yes.

01:34:39.700 --> 01:34:42.700
And that’s the key that was just
out of Samuel’s reach.

01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:45.790
There are 400 names on that list.

01:34:47.170 --> 01:34:50.540
And let me guess,
they all got some of these pills.

01:34:52.130 --> 01:34:55.970
Yes. And they all received
the same hypnosis therapy as me.

01:34:57.260 --> 01:35:01.890
Ready to be framed, or killed,
or whatever David Gordon needs that day.

01:35:05.020 --> 01:35:09.980
But that’s... that’s what Indemnity is,
isn’t it?

01:35:11.690 --> 01:35:12.690
Yes.

01:35:19.530 --> 01:35:20.530
Sancore’s founding statement.

01:35:21.450 --> 01:35:25.620
Beautifully worded by you-know-who,
David Gordon.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:30.290
But there’s only one thing
I can’t figure out.

01:35:32.460 --> 01:35:35.050
Angie started digging around two days ago.

01:35:37.090 --> 01:35:39.800
So when did you program me?

01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:42.010
Was it during all of our sessions?

01:35:43.560 --> 01:35:45.430
So that you can use me the day
you need me?

01:35:49.190 --> 01:35:51.270
Well, you have two options, Doc.

01:35:57.240 --> 01:36:00.700
Either you tell me what you did to me
and why.

01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:04.030
Or everything comes to an end for you,
right now.

01:36:08.210 --> 01:36:09.910
<i>Hi, it's Detective Williamson,</i>

01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:11.310
<i>please leave a message.</i>

01:36:19.380 --> 01:36:24.260
This is a post-hypnotic
triggering mechanism.

01:36:25.890 --> 01:36:28.350
It synchronizes
with the electrical currents in your brain

01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:29.520
to take over.

01:36:30.810 --> 01:36:35.610
All I need to do is press this button
and you’re activated.

01:36:36.730 --> 01:36:37.940
What do you mean, activated?

01:36:40.610 --> 01:36:43.070
You were programmed to kill your wife,
Theo.

01:36:44.070 --> 01:36:44.990
What? Why?

01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:48.620
That’s not why we originally selected you
for the program...

01:36:50.460 --> 01:36:52.420
but she started digging
in the wrong places.

01:36:52.620 --> 01:36:54.960
She forced us to move things along
more quickly.

01:36:57.803 --> 01:37:00.380
- You’re messing with my head.
- That’s how the program works.

01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:04.800
People become weapons.
Theo, you are Indemnity.

01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:09.430
The hypnosis by itself wasn’t sufficient.
That’s why we created Torvidep.

01:37:09.890 --> 01:37:13.060
It makes the patient more receptive
to instructions.

01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:00.320
Listen closely.

01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:05.200
The instructions speak
to the primal components of the brain.

01:38:07.030 --> 01:38:10.620
And it works because it connects
to instincts that are already there.

01:38:11.700 --> 01:38:14.080
No matter how you look at it,

01:38:14.290 --> 01:38:17.380
it’s still your hands that strangled
your wife.

01:38:18.090 --> 01:38:20.460
You’re here because you’re looking
for redemption,

01:38:20.670 --> 01:38:22.970
something to free you from that burden
of guilt.

01:38:24.510 --> 01:38:25.930
But I can’t give it to you.

01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:28.850
You think I’m mad.

01:38:29.850 --> 01:38:33.310
To be able to program a person
in this way isn’t madness,

01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:36.900
it’s brilliant, it’s innovative,
the future of warfare.

01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:41.860
I could use your pain, your trauma,
because you allowed it.

01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:45.860
You made yourself the ideal candidate.

01:38:47.030 --> 01:38:49.030
You’re looking for proof
that you’re innocent,

01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:51.370
but that’s the one thing
you’ll never find.

01:38:51.950 --> 01:38:54.830
That’s what makes my process perfect.

01:38:56.080 --> 01:38:59.540
If Angela had published her story,
it would have destroyed this country.

01:39:00.380 --> 01:39:03.340
There’s honor in what you did.
A higher purpose.

01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:11.140
This program, believe me,
it’s our big chance to change the world.

01:39:13.060 --> 01:39:14.390
Why are you telling me all this?

01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:19.020
You have about 30 seconds to decide.

01:39:20.190 --> 01:39:22.980
Either you can keep your trap shut
about everything you just heard

01:39:23.650 --> 01:39:26.570
or soon you can visit your son
in the morgue.

01:39:30.450 --> 01:39:31.410
I’ll kill you.

01:39:31.620 --> 01:39:35.290
Then you’re also killing Wesley.
That I can guarantee.

01:39:35.500 --> 01:39:37.210
They might ask questions you don’t want
to answer.

01:39:37.410 --> 01:39:38.920
You think that I’ll let you get away
with this?

01:39:39.250 --> 01:39:41.750
- After everything you’ve done to me?
- Abrams...

01:39:43.170 --> 01:39:44.250
leave her alone.

01:39:45.550 --> 01:39:47.510
Abrams, stand back.

01:39:51.350 --> 01:39:52.390
Don’t shoot.

01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:00.690
On your knees and put down the weapon.

01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:10.530
Williamson, wait, wait, wait.

01:40:12.660 --> 01:40:18.410
Mr. Abrams, you said there’s a conspiracy,
false evidence against you.

01:40:19.460 --> 01:40:21.380
Please, I want to hear your side
of the story.

01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:29.550
Is there a reason you don’t want
to talk to me?

01:40:32.220 --> 01:40:33.430
Look, you can trust us.

01:40:37.930 --> 01:40:38.980
I’m guilty.

01:40:41.940 --> 01:40:42.940
I did it.

01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:48.320
Come on.

01:40:54.450 --> 01:40:55.450
Excuse me, guys.

01:40:57.450 --> 01:40:58.410
Thank you.

01:41:02.210 --> 01:41:05.630
What happened here?
Why was he here with you?

01:41:08.170 --> 01:41:09.970
My guess? He was looking for help.

01:41:11.050 --> 01:41:12.050
Therapy.

01:41:13.090 --> 01:41:14.760
After everything he’s caused.

01:41:19.140 --> 01:41:21.140
Please drop my car off at the station,
thank you.

01:41:21.770 --> 01:41:23.060
How did you get here so quickly?

01:41:25.610 --> 01:41:26.570
I...

01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:30.400
I happened to be around the corner
when the alert came through.

01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:36.240
The Commissioner wants us back
at the station for a press conference.

01:41:37.030 --> 01:41:40.500
She wants us to capitalize on the arrest.
As soon as possible.

01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:43.210
You should do it.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.500
You deserve it, you’re a good detective.

01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:50.880
You’re the future.

01:41:53.090 --> 01:41:54.130
I’m retiring.

01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:54.360
That stuff you said about your daughter
is true, isn’t it?

01:42:55.900 --> 01:42:58.660
Then you’ll understand, the only thing
that matters to me now is Wesley.

01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:00.740
And he doesn’t have anything to do
with this.

01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:07.620
- Where’s his son? Where’s Wesley?
- That’s none of your business.

01:43:07.830 --> 01:43:09.790
No, wait, you said he’d be safe.

01:43:10.540 --> 01:43:13.840
Hey! What do I tell my superiors
and the media?

01:43:14.460 --> 01:43:15.880
You’re clever, you’ll think of something.

01:43:16.260 --> 01:43:18.470
Listen, please, you can do what you want
with me,

01:43:19.850 --> 01:43:20.890
but leave Wesley out of this.

01:43:22.510 --> 01:43:23.600
Please, he’s my child.

01:43:24.983 --> 01:43:27.730
Stop whining, he won’t know what
it’s like being an orphan for very long.

01:43:38.860 --> 01:43:40.450
Get up and run.

01:43:42.790 --> 01:43:44.160
Sorry, Wesley.

01:44:00.090 --> 01:44:01.970
Give me your gun. Give me your gun.

01:44:06.600 --> 01:44:09.810
Was it you who gave Wesley to them?
Is that why you helped me just now?

01:44:14.940 --> 01:44:16.240
So I’m only going to ask you this once.

01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:18.900
What did you do with my son?

01:44:19.110 --> 01:44:20.910
Tell me now, or I swear I’ll blow
your brains out.

01:44:25.580 --> 01:44:26.540
M-Tech.

01:44:28.120 --> 01:44:29.160
He’s at M-Tech.

01:44:33.880 --> 01:44:34.840
Get in.

01:44:39.050 --> 01:44:41.800
Theo, please. I can help you get him out.

01:44:42.840 --> 01:44:45.430
You can’t go in there alone,
that’s just crazy.

01:44:49.230 --> 01:44:50.330
Theo!

01:44:54.770 --> 01:44:56.150
Luckily for you, I’m already crazy.

01:46:36.630 --> 01:46:37.790
- Wake him up.
- Sir?

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:39.040
I said, wake him up.

01:47:01.940 --> 01:47:02.940
Mr. Abrams.

01:47:05.240 --> 01:47:07.320
It seems like the two of us were destined
to meet today.

01:47:07.570 --> 01:47:08.530
Where’s my son?

01:47:09.830 --> 01:47:12.540
You need to stop this lone wolf
in the eleventh-hour bullshit.

01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:15.250
This thing certainly isn’t going to end
the way you want it to.

01:47:15.580 --> 01:47:19.040
But I know men like you.
You hide behind patriotism.

01:47:20.630 --> 01:47:21.960
But the truth will always come to light.

01:47:22.420 --> 01:47:24.420
You know absolutely nothing about men
like me.

01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:30.550
You use trauma, innocent people’s pain,
as weapons.

01:47:31.310 --> 01:47:34.100
This situation is a bit larger
than the loss you...

01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:37.060
What’s the point, you wouldn’t understand.

01:47:37.310 --> 01:47:40.230
I know you have an agenda.
You kill people all across Africa.

01:47:40.650 --> 01:47:43.360
And I don’t care what the reasons are,
all I want is my child.

01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:52.740
Take him to the laboratory.

01:48:09.430 --> 01:48:10.390
Where’s Wesley?

01:48:11.550 --> 01:48:12.930
You’ll see him again soon, Mr. Abrams.

01:48:16.284 --> 01:48:17.430
What do you want?

01:48:18.190 --> 01:48:19.940
In a word, freedom.

01:48:21.020 --> 01:48:24.690
The Chinese and the Americans have
stolen Africa’s most valuable resources,

01:48:25.150 --> 01:48:26.110
taken over our economies

01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:28.400
and run our democracies
for their own benefit.

01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:32.160
Not anymore.

01:48:34.450 --> 01:48:35.910
I’m going to take back what’s ours.

01:48:38.160 --> 01:48:39.580
So you want to start a war?

01:48:40.580 --> 01:48:41.920
Kill millions of people.

01:48:42.630 --> 01:48:43.590
Perhaps.

01:48:44.710 --> 01:48:46.460
But Africa is finally united.

01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:49.090
Thanks to my weapons.

01:48:50.180 --> 01:48:52.970
If it takes a war to get
the colonial powers off our continent,

01:48:53.180 --> 01:48:54.220
then that is what will happen.

01:48:54.430 --> 01:48:57.890
Please, you don’t care about the people
of Africa.

01:48:58.350 --> 01:48:59.520
All you want is power.

01:49:00.310 --> 01:49:02.270
So show us what your true motives are.

01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:07.360
You almost threw a spanner in the works,
Mr. Abrams.

01:49:08.110 --> 01:49:09.700
But in the end you were quite useful.

01:49:10.900 --> 01:49:14.320
We are very close to the finish line,
thanks to you shutting up your wife.

01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:17.290
We are very grateful to you.

01:49:19.450 --> 01:49:21.420
So I’m going to do you a favor.

01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:25.170
Your own hands will determine
what happens next.

01:49:26.590 --> 01:49:27.880
Will you prepare, Doctor?

01:49:30.470 --> 01:49:31.800
His son, Wesley.

01:49:33.510 --> 01:49:35.600
No. No, no, no, no!

01:49:36.100 --> 01:49:37.060
No!

01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:38.850
Do it or must I take over?

01:49:39.850 --> 01:49:40.980
I’m going to kill you.

01:49:43.150 --> 01:49:47.520
- Let me know when you’re done.
- I’m going to fucking kill you! No!

01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:52.740
Please, please,
you don’t need to do this, please.

01:49:53.240 --> 01:49:54.200
Please!

01:49:59.770 --> 01:50:04.680
Shit.

01:50:18.103 --> 01:50:19.640
Think very carefully
about what your next move is going to be.

01:50:19.850 --> 01:50:22.480
Okay? Where is he? Where’s Wesley?

01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:27.060
I trusted you, Doc.
And you turned me into a murderer.

01:50:27.310 --> 01:50:30.820
So what’s happening to you now
is your own fault.

01:50:31.240 --> 01:50:33.070
Where’s Wesley?

01:50:33.570 --> 01:50:35.770
The western corridor.

01:50:35.870 --> 01:50:37.680
Substation three.

01:51:53.250 --> 01:51:58.120
Wesley!

01:52:00.020 --> 01:52:02.760
Wesley!

01:52:09.530 --> 01:52:11.140
Wesley!

01:52:12.800 --> 01:52:14.610
Wes!

01:52:21.010 --> 01:52:24.350
Wesley!

01:52:25.980 --> 01:52:27.550
Wesley!

01:52:36.630 --> 01:52:38.230
Wesley!

01:52:39.730 --> 01:52:40.770
No!

01:52:46.170 --> 01:52:48.770
Wesley!

01:52:52.420 --> 01:52:54.040
No!

01:54:21.270 --> 01:54:23.230
Wesley!

01:54:25.930 --> 01:54:27.050
Stand back, Wesley.

01:54:33.640 --> 01:54:34.730
Stand back, Wesley.

01:55:02.970 --> 01:55:04.880
Wesley?

01:55:23.990 --> 01:55:25.030
I’ve got you.

01:55:57.500 --> 01:56:00.660
Daddy? Daddy! Daddy!

01:56:02.200 --> 01:56:05.670
Daddy? Daddy! Daddy! Dad!

01:56:36.870 --> 01:56:38.300
<i>The horrors that have</i>

01:56:38.470 --> 01:56:40.340
<i>come to light about M-Tech's
gross abuse of power</i>

01:56:40.670 --> 01:56:42.440
<i>left all of us traumatised.</i>

01:56:42.910 --> 01:56:44.440
<i>But justice will prevail.</i>

01:56:44.740 --> 01:56:47.010
<i>As we look at fixing
the missteps of government,</i>

01:56:47.580 --> 01:56:49.780
<i>we must usher in
a time for healing,</i>

01:56:50.280 --> 01:56:52.350
<i>in memory of those
countless lives lost,</i>

01:56:52.980 --> 01:56:55.050
<i>by those who were
simply misguided.</i>

01:56:56.920 --> 01:56:58.020
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:56:59.020 --> 01:57:00.130
<i>That was a mere two hours</i>

01:57:00.260 --> 01:57:02.960
<i>before Minister of Defense,
David Gordon, was implicated</i>

01:57:03.090 --> 01:57:06.530
<i>on charges of terrorism,
racketeering, murder,</i>

01:57:06.660 --> 01:57:08.830
<i>and conspiracy,

<i>M-Tech investigation</i>

01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:12.670
<i>that sent shockwaves
around the world.</i>

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:26.130
How are you holding up?

01:58:31.050 --> 01:58:33.630
I’m doing everything to get you
out of here.

01:58:35.680 --> 01:58:37.800
But it’s going to take a few more days.

01:58:38.930 --> 01:58:40.930
It’s a unique case, to say the least.

01:58:41.810 --> 01:58:42.770
What does it matter?

01:58:46.150 --> 01:58:47.150
It doesn’t.

01:58:49.400 --> 01:58:50.940
You’re a brave man, Theo.

01:58:52.650 --> 01:58:56.410
You’re stronger than just about anyone
I’ve ever worked with.

01:58:57.370 --> 01:58:58.990
But you’re punishing
yourself unnecessarily,

01:58:59.240 --> 01:59:00.410
for something that’s not your fault.

01:59:01.700 --> 01:59:04.920
You have to learn to forgive yourself,
no one will do it for you.

01:59:08.290 --> 01:59:13.510
Otherwise you’ll end up a bitter old man
with only regret for company.

01:59:16.840 --> 01:59:18.430
You say it doesn’t matter.

01:59:26.230 --> 01:59:27.190
Tell him that.

01:59:35.650 --> 01:59:37.660
Daddy, when are you coming home?

01:59:45.620 --> 01:59:46.710
One of these days, okay?

01:59:47.670 --> 01:59:49.540
- I promise.
- Good.

01:59:50.670 --> 01:59:52.130
We need to talk business.

02:00:25.950 --> 02:00:26.960
Hi.

02:00:29.330 --> 02:00:30.540
My name is Theo Abrams.
