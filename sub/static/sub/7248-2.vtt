00:04.796 --> 00:06.548
- That's nice.
- Thank you.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.509
Don't move, please.

00:09.968 --> 00:11.970
Why are you insisting on doing this?

00:12.054 --> 00:15.140
Because you're starting
private school tomorrow.

00:15.224 --> 00:18.602
Yes, but I'm gonna be wearing shoes.
Nobody's gonna see my feet.

00:18.685 --> 00:22.105
Okay, but everybody knows
that private school girls are bad.

00:22.189 --> 00:25.025
And bad girls always wear red nail polish.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.196
Are you nervous?

00:29.279 --> 00:31.823
- About what?
- About starting Chilton.

00:32.031 --> 00:35.244
I wasn't until I heard about
all those bad girls.

00:35.702 --> 00:38.956
Guys! New CD!
XTC, Apple Venus Volume 2!

00:39.540 --> 00:42.292
- Good!
- But you only finished half my toes.

00:42.417 --> 00:45.295
Who cares?
You're gonna be wearing shoes anyway!

01:57.159 --> 01:58.243
Mom!

01:58.702 --> 02:00.120
What? God! Hi.

02:00.204 --> 02:03.081
- What are you doing?
- Having a heart attack.

02:03.165 --> 02:05.417
I thought you were up. It's 7:10.

02:05.501 --> 02:07.085
- What?
- It's 7:10.

02:07.169 --> 02:08.127
No.

02:09.338 --> 02:11.173
Stop it! It's 5:45.

02:11.215 --> 02:13.175
- No, it's not!
- Yes, it is.

02:13.217 --> 02:16.053
I set the clock for 5:45, so it's...

02:16.803 --> 02:18.263
It's 7:10.

02:19.014 --> 02:21.141
I can't be late on my first day of school.

02:21.225 --> 02:23.977
You know what happens
when people are late on the first day?

02:24.019 --> 02:25.062
It's shorter?

02:25.145 --> 02:27.814
For the rest of the year
they're labeled 'The late girl. '

02:27.856 --> 02:30.317
So dramatic. Where's the bathroom?

02:30.817 --> 02:33.612
We have to go! What if there's traffic?

02:35.614 --> 02:38.617
I had this all planned.
I was gonna get up early.

02:38.700 --> 02:42.079
I was gonna get coffee.
I was gonna take a shower.

02:42.162 --> 02:45.582
I was gonna pick up my clothes
from the dry cleaner's.

02:47.334 --> 02:50.462
- Oh, my God. My clothes.
- What?

02:50.504 --> 02:53.507
- I don't have any clean clothes.
- It's 7:15.

02:53.590 --> 02:56.343
- All my nice things were dirty.
- It's 7:16.

02:56.426 --> 02:58.971
I was gonna wear my blue suit
with the flippy skirt.

02:59.054 --> 03:01.890
- I look so great in the flippy skirt.
- It's 7:17.

03:01.974 --> 03:03.433
You know what, time lady?

03:03.517 --> 03:07.312
Go downstairs and warm up the car.
That would be really super. Thank you.

03:07.396 --> 03:08.814
Just hurry!

03:08.981 --> 03:11.024
This sucks!

03:11.149 --> 03:13.986
- It's 7:18.
- For the love of God!

03:14.987 --> 03:18.615
This is the last time I buy anything
just because it's furry!

03:20.492 --> 03:21.493
It's 7...

03:21.577 --> 03:24.246
Don't even think
of finishing that sentence.

03:24.830 --> 03:25.956
What?

03:26.039 --> 03:28.333
Nothing. I just didn't know
the rodeo was in town.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.460
That's it. I'm bringing the baby pictures.

03:30.544 --> 03:34.256
No! I'm sorry.
I love the rodeo, the rodeo rules.

04:19.091 --> 04:22.262
- I remember it being smaller.
- Yeah. And less...

04:22.513 --> 04:24.640
- Off with their heads.
- Yeah.

04:27.184 --> 04:28.810
What are you looking at?

04:28.852 --> 04:32.689
I'm just trying to see if there's
a hunchback up in that bell tower.

04:33.232 --> 04:34.858
So, how do I look?

04:37.027 --> 04:38.487
You look great.

04:39.029 --> 04:40.489
- Really?
- Really.

04:40.531 --> 04:44.076
You are an amazing kid.
You have earned this.

04:44.493 --> 04:47.955
You just go in there
and show them what smart really is.

04:48.038 --> 04:50.791
I love you. Call me if you need me.

04:52.376 --> 04:54.461
- You're kidding, right?
- No.

04:54.753 --> 04:58.799
Call me if you need anything.
I'm great at making up dirty cheers.

04:58.841 --> 05:02.094
- You have to go in with me.
- Rory, come on.

05:02.344 --> 05:04.388
You have to meet the headmaster.

05:04.680 --> 05:07.975
Look at me. I can't meet anybody
who does anything in there.

05:08.475 --> 05:11.186
No! I look like that chick
from The Dukes of Hazzard.

05:11.270 --> 05:13.105
This is my first day.

05:13.146 --> 05:16.483
You are not getting out of
going in there with me. Period.

05:22.489 --> 05:23.991
Good morning.

05:26.118 --> 05:28.245
We're gonna be best friends.

05:28.579 --> 05:31.790
- So, where do we go?
- The Ambroise building.

05:32.666 --> 05:35.210
- Which is?
- The big, scary one.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.797
Great! Thanks for the input.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.633
- Lost?
- Yeah.

05:41.717 --> 05:45.095
We're looking for the headmaster's office,
Ambroise building.

05:45.304 --> 05:47.472
Okay. This is it right here.

05:47.639 --> 05:50.559
Just go inside, down the stairs,
make a left...

05:50.642 --> 05:53.312
and the headmaster's office
is at the end of the hall.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.564
- Great. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

05:56.440 --> 05:59.151
I'm Ian Jack.
My daughter Julia goes to school here.

05:59.234 --> 06:03.071
Hi. I'm Lorelai Gilmore.
This is my daughter, Rory.

06:04.323 --> 06:06.450
- Your daughter? Really?
- Yep.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.160
Wow, that's great.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.079
I mean, daughters are a great thing.

06:11.163 --> 06:12.998
- We're big fans.
- Yeah.

06:15.292 --> 06:17.628
Is your husband here?
I'd love to meet him.

06:17.669 --> 06:19.254
I'm not married.

06:19.838 --> 06:21.298
I'd love to meet your wife.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.008
- I'm divorced.
- Shame.

06:23.091 --> 06:25.093
- Excuse me. I really got to...
- Right.

06:25.177 --> 06:27.888
We gotta go meet the big guy,
and I gotta get back to work.

06:27.971 --> 06:29.973
- Where do you work?
- At an inn.

06:30.057 --> 06:33.644
- The Independence Inn. I run it.
- Really?

06:34.728 --> 06:36.813
In a different outfit, of course.

06:37.147 --> 06:40.400
It was nice to meet you, Lorelai.
Good luck in school, Rory.

06:40.484 --> 06:43.278
- I'll tell Julia to look out for you.
- Great, thanks.

06:43.320 --> 06:44.613
See you.

06:46.949 --> 06:48.700
What a nice man.

06:48.992 --> 06:52.120
You're feeling pretty good
about yourself right now, aren't you?

06:52.162 --> 06:53.372
Yeah.

06:53.455 --> 06:56.834
- Do you want me to get you a mirror?
- I'm back. Let's go.

07:01.922 --> 07:04.174
Good. More big stuff.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.583
- You ready?
- No.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.045
- You ready?
- Yes.

07:51.722 --> 07:52.806
Excuse me.

07:54.016 --> 07:56.852
Hi. I'm Lorelai Gilmore.

07:56.935 --> 08:00.647
This is my daughter, Lorelai Gilmore,
because I named her after me.

08:00.731 --> 08:04.193
I was in the hospital, all whacked out
on Demerol. Never mind.

08:04.443 --> 08:07.779
But we call her Rory.
It's short for Lorelai...

08:07.821 --> 08:11.200
but she'll answer to either one
or even 'Hey, you' depending on...

08:11.283 --> 08:13.160
Is the headmaster here?

08:13.327 --> 08:14.703
One moment.

08:21.210 --> 08:25.172
See, that's what happens
when you go to bed with your makeup on.

08:28.675 --> 08:31.136
Headmaster Charleston will see you now.

08:32.304 --> 08:33.972
Great. Thanks.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.893
Ms. Gilmore, I'm Headmaster Charleston.

08:37.976 --> 08:40.562
Hi. Wow. It's really nice to meet...

08:41.813 --> 08:42.856
Mom.

08:47.069 --> 08:48.487
What are you doing here?

08:48.529 --> 08:51.990
I came to wish my granddaughter luck
on her first day of school.

08:52.074 --> 08:54.701
Rory, you look wonderful in that uniform.

08:54.785 --> 08:57.246
You didn't have to come all the way
out here, Mom.

08:57.329 --> 09:01.124
This gave me a chance to make sure
that Hanlin here takes good care of Rory.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.502
- You're Hanlin.
- Hanlin Charleston.

09:03.585 --> 09:07.089
Hanlin's wife and I are on the Symphony
Fundraising Committee together.

09:07.172 --> 09:08.549
Wow. That's great.

09:08.632 --> 09:10.425
Your father and I are golf rivals.

09:10.467 --> 09:13.136
We're still fighting it out
to see which one is worse.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.222
Oh, yes. We're all old friends.

09:15.305 --> 09:17.474
Well, there's nothing like friends.

09:17.516 --> 09:20.435
Especially if they're old... ones.

09:21.979 --> 09:24.523
Would you like to take off your coat
and have a seat?

09:24.606 --> 09:26.483
No, I'm fine.

09:26.525 --> 09:29.611
They were a little overzealous
with the furnace this morning.

09:29.653 --> 09:32.322
- It's quite warm in here.
- I like it warm.

09:32.406 --> 09:34.241
Take off your coat and sit down.

09:34.324 --> 09:36.827
You don't want Hanlin
to think you're rude.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.298
Laundry day.

09:52.342 --> 09:56.638
Hanlin, did you know
that Rory has a 4.0 grade average?

09:56.847 --> 09:58.223
I'm sure he does, Mom.

09:58.307 --> 10:00.976
This is a very special girl.
You take good care of her.

10:01.059 --> 10:02.519
We'll do our best, Emily.

10:02.603 --> 10:04.771
Oh, God. Rory's not going to be a problem.

10:04.813 --> 10:07.816
She's totally low maintenance.
You know, like a Honda.

10:07.900 --> 10:10.194
You know, they're just easy...

10:12.529 --> 10:13.947
Nice office.

10:13.989 --> 10:16.992
I don't think we should take up
any more of your precious time.

10:17.075 --> 10:20.162
Hanlin, it was lovely to see you.
Give Bitty our love.

10:20.245 --> 10:22.623
Tell Richard I'll see him
at the club Sunday.

10:22.706 --> 10:25.792
Have a wonderful day, Rory.
I want to hear all about it.

10:25.834 --> 10:28.837
Do you need a ride,
or is your horse parked outside?

10:30.506 --> 10:32.508
It's so nice to meet you.

10:33.050 --> 10:34.676
Have a great day.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.472
You don't want to forget your coat.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.600
No, 'cause that would be embarrassing.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.816
How do you leave the house
looking like that?

10:49.900 --> 10:51.360
It was not planned, believe me.

10:51.443 --> 10:52.903
And on Rory's first day of school.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.197
What kind of impression
did you think you'd make?

10:55.280 --> 10:56.448
What are you doing here?

10:56.532 --> 10:58.909
I told you,
I came to put in a good word for Rory.

10:58.992 --> 11:02.120
- She didn't need a good word.
- I'm not allowed here, is that it?

11:02.162 --> 11:03.330
I didn't say that.

11:03.413 --> 11:05.999
I'm allowed to pay,
but I can't set foot on the premises.

11:06.083 --> 11:08.252
- I want to get the rules straight.
- Oh, boy.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.838
- How about driving down the street?
- Forget it.

11:10.921 --> 11:13.340
Maybe I should avoid
this neighborhood altogether.

11:13.423 --> 11:15.217
Though my doctor is down the block.

11:15.300 --> 11:18.178
Maybe I'll get special permission
if I'm bleeding from the head.

11:18.262 --> 11:21.765
I'm sorry.
I was just surprised to see you here.

11:21.849 --> 11:25.978
I thought it was important for this school
to know they had a Gilmore with them.

11:26.061 --> 11:27.437
A very good thought.

11:27.479 --> 11:29.815
And that some of the Gilmores
actually own clothing.

11:29.898 --> 11:32.985
And on that note, I have to get to work.
I'll see you later.

11:33.068 --> 11:35.779
Dinner, Friday night. No spurs, please.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.619
You're obviously a bright girl,
Miss Gilmore.

11:42.703 --> 11:45.831
- Thank you.
- Good grades, the teachers like you.

11:45.914 --> 11:48.625
Not a lot of social activities, though.

11:49.418 --> 11:52.171
Just living at Stars Hollow
is a social activity, actually.

11:52.254 --> 11:54.173
Nothing in your school appealed to you?

11:54.256 --> 11:57.009
I work at my mother's inn
after school sometimes.

11:57.092 --> 12:00.596
I was in the German Club for a while.
But there were only three of us.

12:00.679 --> 12:04.433
Then two left for the French Club
after seeing Schindler's List.

12:04.474 --> 12:06.435
What are your aspirations?

12:06.476 --> 12:09.771
I want to go to Harvard
to study Journalism and Political Science.

12:09.813 --> 12:12.649
- On your way to being...
- Christiane Amanpour.

12:12.733 --> 12:14.193
- Really?
- Yes.

12:14.735 --> 12:16.737
- Not Cokie Roberts?
- No.

12:16.820 --> 12:20.532
Not Oprah, Rosie, or one of the women
from The View?

12:21.158 --> 12:22.159
No.

12:22.826 --> 12:25.078
Why do you wish
to be Christiane Amanpour?

12:25.162 --> 12:27.456
I don't wish to be her exactly.

12:27.498 --> 12:30.083
- I just want to do what she does.
- Which is?

12:31.543 --> 12:34.213
Travel, see the world up close...

12:34.296 --> 12:38.091
report on what's really going on,
be part of something big.

12:38.133 --> 12:41.261
And to be a part of something big
you have to be on TV?

12:41.303 --> 12:43.347
Why not lead the police
on a high-speed chase?

12:43.430 --> 12:45.307
That's a quicker way to achieve this goal.

12:45.349 --> 12:47.226
Being on TV has nothing to do with it.

12:47.309 --> 12:51.313
Maybe I'll be a journalist and write books
or articles about what I see.

12:51.647 --> 12:55.150
I just want to be sure
that I see... something.

12:58.654 --> 13:02.407
You'll notice the debating team's
also missing from my resume.

13:04.368 --> 13:07.204
I've known your grandparents
for quite some time.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.455
I know.

13:08.539 --> 13:11.959
In fact, I was at a party
at their house just last week...

13:12.042 --> 13:15.379
where I had the most delicious
lobster puffs I've ever eaten.

13:15.629 --> 13:17.464
I'm very fond of them.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.258
That's nice.

13:19.842 --> 13:22.636
None of this, however,
will be of any benefit to you.

13:22.678 --> 13:25.055
Chilton has one of
the highest academic standards...

13:25.138 --> 13:26.849
of any school in America.

13:26.932 --> 13:29.393
You may have been the smartest girl
at Stars Hollow...

13:29.476 --> 13:31.061
but this is a different place.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.438
Pressures are greater,
the rules are stricter...

13:33.480 --> 13:35.440
and the expectations are higher.

13:35.482 --> 13:36.608
If you make it through...

13:36.692 --> 13:39.611
you'll have received
one of the finest educations one can get.

13:39.653 --> 13:43.115
And there should be no reason
why you should not achieve all your goals.

13:43.198 --> 13:44.950
However, since you are starting late...

13:44.992 --> 13:47.578
and are not used
to this highly competitive atmosphere...

13:47.661 --> 13:50.080
there is a good chance you will fail.

13:51.707 --> 13:54.126
That is fine. Failure is a part of life.

13:55.002 --> 13:57.045
But not a part of Chilton.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.131
Understand?

14:01.800 --> 14:03.802
So, you liked the lobster puffs?

14:07.055 --> 14:10.934
Take this to Miss James
in the administration office across the hall.

14:27.951 --> 14:30.245
Hi, I'm looking for Miss James.

14:30.579 --> 14:33.207
- Name?
- Lorelai Gilmore.

14:34.249 --> 14:37.044
- But I go by Rory.
- Fill this out, please.

14:50.807 --> 14:51.934
- Well?
- Shut up.

14:51.975 --> 14:53.435
Hurry please. Spiders.

14:53.477 --> 14:55.604
- Lorelai Gilmore.
- Nice stripper name.

14:55.687 --> 14:58.065
- Formerly of Stars Hollow High School.
- Where's that?

14:58.148 --> 15:00.984
Drive west, make a left at the haystacks,
and follow the cows.

15:01.068 --> 15:02.402
A Dixie chick.

15:02.486 --> 15:04.488
Perfect attendance,
4.0 grade point average.

15:04.571 --> 15:05.739
Bugs, dirt, twigs.

15:05.822 --> 15:07.074
She's a Journalism major.

15:07.157 --> 15:09.409
That means she's going out
for the school paper.

15:09.493 --> 15:10.828
Not necessarily.

15:10.911 --> 15:12.871
She's got a thousand recommendations
in here.

15:12.955 --> 15:15.457
Popular with the adults.
Going out for the school paper.

15:15.541 --> 15:17.334
Will you stop? You don't know that.

15:17.417 --> 15:18.669
- Something's biting me.
- Quiet.

15:18.752 --> 15:19.753
I hate nature.

15:19.795 --> 15:21.713
She'll never catch up.
She's a month behind.

15:21.797 --> 15:24.383
- You can tutor her. Be like a big sister.
- You're funny.

15:24.466 --> 15:26.051
Okay, lizard, goodbye.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.512
Why are they letting
these extra people in?

15:28.595 --> 15:30.722
They just take up space
and screw up the curve.

15:30.806 --> 15:32.683
We don't need any new kids here.

15:32.766 --> 15:34.017
Too late.

15:36.812 --> 15:39.439
Here's the dining room, the science hall,
and the theater.

15:39.523 --> 15:42.568
Here's your locker number,
here's your schedule, take this map.

15:42.609 --> 15:45.612
Here's the rules of the school
and the Chilton Honor Code.

15:45.654 --> 15:49.157
Here are the words to the school song
which must be recited upon demand.

15:49.241 --> 15:51.159
This can happen any place, any time.

15:51.243 --> 15:55.038
If you do it in Latin, you get extra credit.
Do you have any questions?

15:55.122 --> 15:57.666
- Not at the moment.
- Lf you do, make an appointment...

15:57.749 --> 15:59.668
to see your guidance counselor,
Mr. Winters.

15:59.751 --> 16:02.045
He handles everything
but bulimia and pregnancy.

16:02.129 --> 16:05.465
For that, you have to go to the nurse
or Coach Rubens.

16:05.507 --> 16:07.259
Welcome to Chilton.

16:15.809 --> 16:19.313
I already had the longest day of my life,
and it's only 10:00. How nice.

16:19.396 --> 16:20.981
- There's no coffee.
- That's not funny.

16:21.064 --> 16:22.316
I can give you herbal tea.

16:22.399 --> 16:25.235
This is not an herbal tea morning.
This is a coffee morning.

16:25.319 --> 16:27.404
Every morning for you is a coffee morning.

16:27.446 --> 16:30.240
This is a jumbo coffee morning.
I need coffee in an I.V.

16:30.282 --> 16:31.992
I can give you tea and a Balance Bar.

16:32.075 --> 16:34.077
Please, please tell me you're kidding.

16:34.161 --> 16:36.163
- I'm kidding.
- You're sick.

16:36.246 --> 16:38.874
- Yep.
- You're a sadist. You're a fiend!

16:38.957 --> 16:39.958
You're pretty.

16:40.042 --> 16:41.752
- For here or to go?
- To go please.

16:41.835 --> 16:44.338
Want to know what this does
to your nervous system?

16:44.421 --> 16:47.341
- Do you have a chart? I love charts.
- Forget it, kill yourself.

16:47.424 --> 16:50.302
So, what happened this morning
that was so awful?

16:50.636 --> 16:52.846
- Rory started Chilton.
- Really?

16:53.138 --> 16:54.264
Yeah.

16:55.390 --> 16:56.391
What?

16:56.475 --> 16:59.561
That's how you dressed to go to Chilton?
That's a fancy school.

16:59.645 --> 17:03.565
My clothes were at the cleaners,
and my fuzzy clock didn't purr on time.

17:03.607 --> 17:06.401
- It didn't purr?
- It's fuzzy. It purrs.

17:06.443 --> 17:08.569
You know what. Never mind. I gotta go.

17:08.654 --> 17:12.491
- I had a plan, damn it.
- Me, too. Next time you're getting tea.

17:19.330 --> 17:20.833
Visualize, ladies.

17:20.915 --> 17:23.042
It's a Thanksgiving Day parade.

17:23.126 --> 17:24.752
You're standing on Fifth Avenue.

17:24.837 --> 17:28.757
There's 100 beautiful boys
marching in place behind you.

17:28.799 --> 17:30.092
And there you are.

17:30.175 --> 17:34.596
You are in front with your fabulous legs
and your perfect tush.

17:34.638 --> 17:38.392
Your baton is on fire,
and the crowd goes nuts!

17:38.559 --> 17:40.769
Okay, cookie time.

17:41.895 --> 17:44.356
- Lorelai, hi.
- Hey, Patty.

17:44.648 --> 17:46.775
Isn't today Rory's first day at Chilton?

17:46.859 --> 17:49.653
Yeah, she's there now.
I just got through dropping her off.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.113
Is that what you wore?

17:51.196 --> 17:53.866
- Look at the time. See you, Patty.
- Bye.

17:56.118 --> 17:58.245
Ladies, what do I see? Naked girls.

17:58.287 --> 18:02.207
No, no, keep those leotards on.
This is not Brazil.

18:45.542 --> 18:47.169
- Hello?
- Lorelai?

18:47.711 --> 18:48.712
Mom?

18:48.795 --> 18:51.256
Lorelai, good. I'm going shopping
this afternoon.

18:51.298 --> 18:53.300
I thought I'd pick up a few things for Rory.

18:53.342 --> 18:56.637
- Like what?
- A couple of skirts and tops for school.

18:56.803 --> 19:00.849
I already took care of all that, Mom.
I got her two skirts and a bunch of tops.

19:00.933 --> 19:02.768
But there are five days in a school week.

19:02.809 --> 19:06.647
Really? Because my days-of-the-week
underwear only go to Thursday.

19:06.730 --> 19:08.899
- Is that a joke?
- Mom, two skirts are fine.

19:08.982 --> 19:11.610
- I never know with you.
- Really, don't bother.

19:11.693 --> 19:13.320
What if she gets one dirty?

19:13.403 --> 19:16.365
- She'll wear the other one.
- What if she gets them both dirty?

19:16.448 --> 19:19.034
We'll use this newfangled thing
called a washing machine.

19:19.117 --> 19:21.578
The town chipped in and bought one.
My turn's Tuesday.

19:21.662 --> 19:25.040
Then, what about socks?
Chilton has these special logo socks.

19:25.123 --> 19:26.834
- Rory should have them.
- Mom, please.

19:26.917 --> 19:29.253
What about the school sweater?
She might like that.

19:29.336 --> 19:31.505
There's a sweater vest and a book bag.

19:31.588 --> 19:33.423
Are you getting a cut
of the merchandising?

19:33.465 --> 19:36.134
Rory should have these.
She'll be the only one who doesn't.

19:36.218 --> 19:37.678
She'll live.

19:37.761 --> 19:40.472
I'm at least getting her the Chilton coat.
Is she a size 6?

19:40.556 --> 19:42.140
Mom, please.

19:42.307 --> 19:44.434
This is a simple question, Lorelai.

19:44.768 --> 19:47.729
She's a 6,
but I'd get an 8 in case she grows.

19:47.771 --> 19:49.398
If she grows, I'll buy another.

19:49.481 --> 19:52.484
Okay, then a 6 is great.
I gotta go, Mom. Bye.

19:54.278 --> 19:57.656
While French culture was the dominant
outside cultural influence...

19:57.739 --> 19:59.867
especially for Russia's moneyed class...

19:59.950 --> 20:02.244
English culture also had its impact.

20:02.286 --> 20:04.788
Tolstoy's favorite author,
for instance, was...

20:04.872 --> 20:05.873
Dickens.

20:05.956 --> 20:10.460
Yes. And of course, last week we covered
Dostoyevsky's main authorial influences...

20:11.461 --> 20:13.714
- George Sand and Balzac.
- Good.

20:14.089 --> 20:17.676
As Tolstoy commenced writing
War and Peace and Anna Karenina...

20:17.759 --> 20:20.470
- Count Leo would turn to...
- David Copperfield.

20:20.554 --> 20:23.849
Correct. He would turn
to David Copperfield for inspiration.

20:25.392 --> 20:27.394
- Mr. Dugray.
- Sir.

20:27.769 --> 20:29.354
Nice to have you back.

20:29.438 --> 20:31.940
- I hope your grandfather's better.
- Much better, sir.

20:32.024 --> 20:33.942
Good. Take your seat, please.

20:35.152 --> 20:39.072
Great Expectations, A Tale of Two Cities,
Little Dorrit...

20:39.364 --> 20:42.534
all major influences on Leo Tolstoy.

20:43.160 --> 20:44.244
Tomorrow...

20:44.328 --> 20:46.205
- Who's that?
- New girl.

20:46.288 --> 20:50.083
...writing styles of these
two literary masters, Tolstoy and Dickens.

20:50.959 --> 20:52.586
Class dismissed.

20:54.880 --> 20:57.382
Looks like we got ourselves a Mary.

20:58.342 --> 21:01.094
Miss Gilmore, come up here, please.

21:03.430 --> 21:05.474
Here are last week's study materials.

21:05.557 --> 21:08.310
There'll be a test on them tomorrow.
But since you're new...

21:08.393 --> 21:11.480
you can take a makeup on Monday.
Will that be sufficient time?

21:11.563 --> 21:13.732
Monday? Sure, that's fine.

21:14.107 --> 21:15.609
Good. That's just an overview.

21:15.692 --> 21:18.529
It'd be helpful to borrow
another student's personal notes.

21:18.612 --> 21:20.572
They tend to be more detailed.

21:20.948 --> 21:22.741
More detailed than this?

21:22.783 --> 21:24.868
It seems daunting right now, I know.

21:24.952 --> 21:27.746
No. It's okay. It'll be fine.

21:28.455 --> 21:31.375
Remember to get those notes.
They'll be a lifesaver.

21:33.919 --> 21:35.045
I'm Paris.

21:35.128 --> 21:37.214
I didn't see you there.
Where'd you come from?

21:37.297 --> 21:38.841
I know who you are, too.

21:38.924 --> 21:41.260
Lorelai Gilmore from Stars Hollow.

21:41.301 --> 21:42.719
You can call me Rory.

21:42.803 --> 21:45.013
- Are you going out for The Franklin?
- The what?

21:45.097 --> 21:46.223
Nice innocent act.

21:46.265 --> 21:48.600
At least I know
you're not going out for Drama Club.

21:48.684 --> 21:49.852
I'm confused.

21:49.935 --> 21:53.146
The Franklin, the school paper,
are you going out for it?

21:53.230 --> 21:55.315
I don't know. I have to find my locker first.

21:55.399 --> 21:58.360
- I'm gonna be editor next year.
- Good for you.

21:58.443 --> 21:59.695
I'm also the top of the class.

21:59.778 --> 22:02.239
I intend to be valedictorian
when I graduate.

22:02.281 --> 22:03.782
Okay. I'm going now.

22:03.866 --> 22:06.285
You'll never catch up.
You'll never beat me.

22:06.368 --> 22:09.454
This school is my domain,
and The Franklin is my domain.

22:09.538 --> 22:11.623
Don't you ever forget that.

22:14.501 --> 22:17.880
I guess you're not
going to let me borrow your notes.

22:26.597 --> 22:28.599
They're smaller than the last batch.

22:28.682 --> 22:30.267
No, they're not.

22:30.767 --> 22:33.020
Smaller means watery.
No good peach taste.

22:33.103 --> 22:34.855
No, there's plenty of peach taste...

22:34.938 --> 22:37.441
being as they're, you know, peaches.

22:37.941 --> 22:40.694
- What about the ones on the bottom?
- Great.

22:40.777 --> 22:43.864
No. Be sure to check them all. That's it.

22:43.947 --> 22:46.450
Give every last one of them
a nice, good squeeze.

22:46.533 --> 22:49.912
You wouldn't want to leave me one
that I could sell to somebody else.

22:49.953 --> 22:53.123
Wait a minute, you missed one.
I won't tell you which one it is.

22:53.207 --> 22:57.336
I'm just going to let your impeccably
good radar... There it is, you got it.

22:57.419 --> 22:58.462
Okay.

22:59.796 --> 23:01.590
- I look great, right?
- Yes.

23:01.673 --> 23:04.343
Yes, see. This is how I was supposed
to look this morning.

23:04.426 --> 23:07.262
- Morning, Jackson.
- Oh, my God, today was Rory's first day.

23:07.346 --> 23:09.598
Yes. I was supposed
to look together and fabulous.

23:09.681 --> 23:11.558
Not like I was playing quarters all night.

23:11.600 --> 23:14.019
- Nobody cares how you looked.
- Everybody cared.

23:14.102 --> 23:16.688
- Who?
- The other moms, the headmaster.

23:16.772 --> 23:20.901
My mom, Luke, Miss Patty,
the new fire chief with the tiny little head.

23:21.443 --> 23:22.778
Taste this.

23:24.404 --> 23:25.781
A little watery.

23:25.864 --> 23:27.574
Now, you planned this.

23:27.616 --> 23:30.369
- Did you say something about your mom?
- Yeah.

23:30.452 --> 23:33.288
I walked into the headmaster's office,
and there she was.

23:33.372 --> 23:34.373
Really? Why?

23:34.456 --> 23:38.252
Because she knew I'd wake up late,
dress like a cowgirl, and humiliate myself.

23:38.335 --> 23:40.712
- Wow, she's good.
- She's the best.

23:41.296 --> 23:43.298
I would love to know what you're doing.

23:43.382 --> 23:46.301
- They're rolling differently, too.
- Because of the extra water.

23:46.385 --> 23:48.595
- Exactly.
- Makes perfect sense.

23:48.929 --> 23:50.514
I would ignore those women...

23:50.597 --> 23:54.226
because the only thing that matters
is that Rory got into that great school.

23:54.309 --> 23:58.313
I know. She looked so amazing
in her uniform, and she was so excited.

23:58.397 --> 24:01.650
I just admire her so much,
jumping into a new school.

24:01.900 --> 24:03.443
- She's my hero.
- Mine, too.

24:03.527 --> 24:05.028
Yeah. Sign me up.

24:05.112 --> 24:07.239
Sookie, the peaches, please.

24:09.032 --> 24:11.618
Excuse me. There's a phone call for you...

24:11.702 --> 24:15.455
and if I'm to fetch you like a dog,
I'd like a cookie and a raise.

24:15.539 --> 24:17.332
Thanks for the peach.

24:20.294 --> 24:22.963
This will be absolutely wonderful.

24:23.046 --> 24:26.258
There are supposed to be darling shops
all up and down this street.

24:26.341 --> 24:30.220
Excuse me, sir. Can you tell me
where we can find the best antiques?

24:30.262 --> 24:32.264
At your house, I'd guess.

24:33.432 --> 24:36.602
Mom, did I give you this number,
'cause I don't remember doing that.

24:36.685 --> 24:39.354
Yeah, well, I must be losing my mind.
What can I...

24:39.438 --> 24:41.899
I'm sorry, Mom,
can you hold on one second?

24:41.940 --> 24:45.110
Drella, could you take it down
just a notch?

24:45.611 --> 24:47.696
Thanks. Okay, I'm back.

24:47.863 --> 24:51.575
I wanted you to know that I just bought
a parking space for Rory at Chilton.

24:51.783 --> 24:54.328
- You what?
- They are very hard to come by.

24:54.411 --> 24:58.081
- But I pulled a few strings and it's all hers.
- Mom, Rory doesn't have a car.

24:58.165 --> 25:00.083
No, but she's got a birthday
coming up soon.

25:00.167 --> 25:02.085
Okay, hold on a second.

25:02.920 --> 25:06.507
Drella, please, a little softer.

25:06.590 --> 25:09.551
Do I look like I got Panasonic
stamped on my ass?

25:10.969 --> 25:13.055
Mom, you are not buying Rory a car.

25:13.138 --> 25:15.432
Why not? She's a smart girl.
She's responsible.

25:15.474 --> 25:18.393
- She doesn't need one.
- She needs to have a way to get around.

25:18.435 --> 25:20.437
- To get to school.
- She'll be taking the bus.

25:20.479 --> 25:22.272
I know. I hate that she takes the bus.

25:22.356 --> 25:23.774
Drug dealers take the bus.

25:23.815 --> 25:25.484
You know what, Mom? I gotta go.

25:25.734 --> 25:27.903
Fine. We'll discuss this at a later date.

25:27.986 --> 25:29.279
Okay. Bye.

25:36.411 --> 25:37.496
Mary.

25:39.122 --> 25:40.582
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

25:40.749 --> 25:43.085
- My name is Rory.
- I'm Tristan.

25:43.168 --> 25:44.795
- Hi.
- So you new?

25:45.045 --> 25:47.965
- Yeah, first day.
- Remmy's class is rough.

25:48.340 --> 25:49.967
Yeah, it seemed very intense.

25:50.050 --> 25:52.553
I could loan you my notes,
if that would help.

25:52.594 --> 25:54.930
- Really? That'd be great.
- Yeah?

25:56.181 --> 25:57.516
How great?

25:57.933 --> 25:59.309
I don't know.

25:59.393 --> 26:02.062
Mr. Remmy said that
getting someone's notes would be...

26:02.104 --> 26:04.857
I could even help you study if you want.

26:06.275 --> 26:09.319
I kind of view studying
as a solitary activity.

26:09.778 --> 26:11.113
But thanks.

26:12.239 --> 26:13.574
Bye, Mary.

26:14.950 --> 26:16.285
It's Rory.

26:19.705 --> 26:23.417
- I completely understand.
- Do you? Because this is a brand-new car.

26:23.500 --> 26:26.086
- But I swear.
- He brings the car up and it's scratched.

26:26.170 --> 26:27.504
I just backed the car up and...

26:27.588 --> 26:30.716
I'd know if my car was scratched
before I parked it or not.

26:30.799 --> 26:32.384
Let's calm down.

26:32.426 --> 26:35.095
Sir, why don't I have your car
looked at tomorrow?

26:35.179 --> 26:38.140
- I'm sure we can find a way to resolve this.
- No.

26:38.223 --> 26:42.060
In the meantime, I would love for you
to have lunch here on me.

26:42.144 --> 26:43.478
Dessert is a must.

26:43.562 --> 26:46.398
Anything with our homemade ice cream
is absolutely delicious.

26:46.481 --> 26:50.402
I promise, life as you know it,
will never be the same. What do you say?

26:51.361 --> 26:52.863
I think I will.

26:52.988 --> 26:54.865
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

26:55.657 --> 26:58.702
- Lorelai, I swear, I didn't scratch his car.
- Derek.

26:58.744 --> 27:01.788
I mean, if you thought I was unreliable
or a bad driver...

27:01.872 --> 27:03.123
It's okay.

27:03.207 --> 27:05.375
'Cause I can drive.

27:05.417 --> 27:07.669
Oh, sweetie. I am sure you can.

27:07.753 --> 27:10.881
We'll take it to Musky's tomorrow
and have the guys look at it.

27:10.923 --> 27:13.717
I'm sure they can buff it out
for nothing. Okay?

27:13.967 --> 27:14.968
Okay.

27:17.429 --> 27:19.723
That's a real nice outfit
you're wearing today.

27:19.765 --> 27:21.391
Thank you, Derek.

27:25.062 --> 27:27.189
Once again, your faithful pooch
is here to say:

27:27.272 --> 27:29.900
'Please come to the desk.
Someone needs to talk to you. '

27:29.942 --> 27:32.402
- It's not my mother, is it?
- It's possible.

27:32.945 --> 27:35.239
- It's possible?
- There's a resemblance.

27:36.532 --> 27:38.867
- Hi.
- Hi. Is this a bad time?

27:38.909 --> 27:41.286
No, not at all. What are you doing here?

27:41.370 --> 27:44.540
I had to meet an associate for lunch.
He was coming from New York.

27:44.581 --> 27:47.209
So I thought,
'Why not meet him in a beautiful inn? '

27:47.251 --> 27:49.628
- Good. Enjoy your lunch.
- Thanks. I will.

27:49.711 --> 27:52.089
- Okay.
- And I was also wondering...

27:52.172 --> 27:54.633
if maybe I could take you out
to dinner sometime.

27:54.716 --> 27:57.135
We're a little food-obsessed, aren't we?

27:57.219 --> 28:00.264
It's the company more than the food
that interests me.

28:00.556 --> 28:02.516
- I'm flattered.
- Is that a yes?

28:02.808 --> 28:04.893
That's a... you're a dad.

28:05.269 --> 28:06.520
And you're a mom.

28:06.603 --> 28:09.940
Although I'm still finding that
really hard to believe.

28:10.023 --> 28:12.401
No, I mean, you're a Chilton dad.

28:13.360 --> 28:16.029
- That sounds bad.
- Not bad. Just tricky.

28:16.280 --> 28:18.157
You know, Rory just started there...

28:18.240 --> 28:20.659
and I should let her fall in
with the bad crowd...

28:20.742 --> 28:22.786
before I start hooking up with the PTA.

28:22.870 --> 28:24.037
I'm not on the PTA.

28:24.121 --> 28:26.999
See? There you go,
I can't date anyone not on the PTA.

28:27.082 --> 28:29.668
- It's just a casual dinner.
- Sorry.

28:33.964 --> 28:37.843
Okay, I'll tell you what.
I'm going to China for a week on business.

28:37.926 --> 28:40.137
When I get back, I'm going to try again.

28:40.220 --> 28:41.889
China? Wow.

28:42.431 --> 28:43.932
- Impressed?
- No.

28:44.433 --> 28:47.769
Rome, I'd be impressed.
China, I'm just, 'China? Wow. '

28:50.439 --> 28:54.193
'Lorelai Gilmore, General Manager. '
I'll talk to you soon.

28:54.610 --> 28:56.653
- Have a safe trip.
- I will.

29:02.242 --> 29:05.537
- He does that so well.
- You are making me sick.

29:06.705 --> 29:09.333
Now, honey. You try it.
I'll watch you walk away, too.

29:09.416 --> 29:11.418
- Stop it.
- Go on now, walk.

29:11.502 --> 29:14.129
- It can't be that bad.
- Leave me alone.

29:14.463 --> 29:17.007
No. You have to do it
with a little more attitude.

29:17.090 --> 29:19.092
Make me think you mean it.

29:33.440 --> 29:34.900
That's lunch.

29:55.379 --> 29:57.548
I'm sorry, but you're going to open.

30:02.886 --> 30:06.306
Oh, no. I am so sorry.

30:06.390 --> 30:08.517
Paris, please, I'm so sorry.

30:08.559 --> 30:11.478
It was an accident.
My locker, it just slipped.

30:11.562 --> 30:14.147
I pulled too hard. I didn't mean to...

30:14.773 --> 30:16.817
Is there water in that moat?

30:16.900 --> 30:18.527
Get away from me.

30:25.075 --> 30:27.911
Excuse me, I need Ms. Ness. History?

30:27.953 --> 30:29.538
It's behind you.

30:31.081 --> 30:32.666
Of course it is.

30:38.255 --> 30:40.382
You've got to be kidding me.

30:43.218 --> 30:44.887
Seats now, please.

30:45.429 --> 30:46.763
Hey, Mary.

30:48.599 --> 30:49.683
Okay.

30:51.185 --> 30:53.770
We left our projects off on Friday
with Mr. Gaynor...

30:53.854 --> 30:56.315
so today we will pick up with Miss Geller.

30:59.026 --> 31:00.444
I don't have my project.

31:00.527 --> 31:03.822
Miss Geller, did you have sufficient time
to complete your project?

31:03.906 --> 31:06.492
- Yes.
- And yet you don't have it done?

31:06.617 --> 31:08.327
- No.
- All right.

31:08.410 --> 31:10.829
You will receive an 'incomplete'
for this project.

31:10.913 --> 31:12.789
- It's my fault.
- Who are you?

31:12.873 --> 31:15.667
- Rory Gilmore. I wrecked her project.
- Shut up.

31:15.751 --> 31:19.880
I don't have a Rory Gilmore.
I have a Lorelai Gilmore.

31:19.922 --> 31:21.048
That's me.

31:21.089 --> 31:23.550
You are Rory and Lorelai Gilmore?

31:23.842 --> 31:26.345
Yes. And I wrecked her project.
My locker got stuck.

31:26.428 --> 31:28.013
Just stay out of this.

31:28.055 --> 31:30.807
- Do you go by Rory or Lorelai?
- Whatever.

31:30.891 --> 31:32.601
It's not her fault.

31:32.768 --> 31:34.937
- I need you to pick one.
- One what?

31:35.020 --> 31:36.271
One name.

31:36.355 --> 31:38.357
- Rory.
- Fine. Thank you.

31:40.776 --> 31:42.736
You wrecked Paris' project when?

31:42.819 --> 31:45.364
- Just before class.
- Very convenient.

31:45.405 --> 31:48.492
No, I did. My locker got stuck,
and when I opened it...

31:48.575 --> 31:49.576
Stop it!

31:49.660 --> 31:52.287
Miss Gilmore, since you say
you wrecked her project...

31:52.371 --> 31:54.456
then you may help her fix it.

31:54.540 --> 31:56.500
You have until tomorrow.

31:56.625 --> 31:57.876
- Fine.
- No.

31:58.168 --> 31:59.962
- Why not?
- I don't want your help.

32:00.045 --> 32:02.381
- But I don't mind doing it.
- Stay out of this.

32:02.464 --> 32:03.799
What's wrong with you?

32:03.882 --> 32:05.342
- I'm trying to help.
- Don't.

32:05.425 --> 32:07.219
Ladies, enough.

32:08.095 --> 32:11.682
If you don't want Miss Gilmore's help,
then you may have until tomorrow.

32:11.765 --> 32:14.601
If it's not done,
you will receive an 'incomplete. '

32:14.685 --> 32:16.395
Is that understood?

32:17.813 --> 32:18.856
Yes.

32:20.732 --> 32:23.277
As long as you're standing, class...

32:23.569 --> 32:26.697
we have a new student.
Say hello to Rory Gilmore.

32:27.239 --> 32:28.866
Hello, Mary.

32:37.291 --> 32:40.043
Now, walk smooth.
That's the new Harry Potter on your heads.

32:40.127 --> 32:43.589
If they should drop, Harry will die,
and there won't be any more books.

32:43.672 --> 32:46.884
Now that's how you should've dressed
this morning, missy.

32:50.888 --> 32:52.848
What are you doing here?

32:53.473 --> 32:57.144
See now, that's why you were voted
Mr. Personality of the new millennium.

32:57.227 --> 32:58.562
Where's your crown?

32:58.604 --> 33:01.064
I just mean you don't usually come in
at this time.

33:01.148 --> 33:03.609
I have to pick up Rory from school.

33:03.901 --> 33:05.360
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

33:05.444 --> 33:06.778
No lectures?

33:06.987 --> 33:10.407
My blood sugar's low.
I'll eat an apple and get back to you.

33:12.034 --> 33:14.495
God, this has been one hectic,
bizarre day for me.

33:14.578 --> 33:15.704
Yeah?

33:15.746 --> 33:18.790
This morning with the being late
and my mom with her existing.

33:18.874 --> 33:20.751
And this father from Chilton.

33:20.834 --> 33:24.713
He drove out to the Inn all the way
from Hartford just to ask me out.

33:25.130 --> 33:26.715
Really? Are you going?

33:26.798 --> 33:31.428
No. He's got a kid in school with Rory,
and the whole thing seemed a little weird.

33:31.845 --> 33:33.889
- Good.
- Good?

33:35.057 --> 33:38.185
Yeah, I think it's good
that you turned him down.

33:38.519 --> 33:39.603
Okay.

33:39.770 --> 33:42.105
- I mean, he's probably old, right?
- Old?

33:42.189 --> 33:45.150
- Yeah, I mean, he has a kid in high school.
- Well, so do I.

33:45.234 --> 33:48.195
You were young when you had Rory.
Most people aren't that young.

33:48.237 --> 33:50.072
- Most people are...
- Old.

33:50.155 --> 33:51.156
Yeah.

33:51.240 --> 33:53.534
Like this guy who asked me out.

33:54.701 --> 33:56.495
But you're not going.

33:57.663 --> 33:59.331
No, I'm not going.

34:04.670 --> 34:06.171
Oh, that's me.

34:09.216 --> 34:11.260
Hello? Hi, Babbette.

34:12.928 --> 34:14.972
What? Okay.

34:15.639 --> 34:17.975
No, I'll be right there. Thanks.

34:19.518 --> 34:20.936
I have to go.

34:21.562 --> 34:23.605
Keep it. I gave you decaf.

34:38.370 --> 34:41.331
Lorelai, I'm so sorry
I had to call you like this.

34:41.415 --> 34:43.542
That's okay, Babbette. I appreciate it.

34:43.625 --> 34:47.420
All of a sudden, they pull up, get out
of the truck, and start sniffing around.

34:47.504 --> 34:49.882
- It's very strange.
- All right. Let me talk to them.

34:49.965 --> 34:52.092
- Tell her about the gnome.
- They kicked a gnome.

34:52.176 --> 34:53.510
- What?
- Right in the head.

34:53.552 --> 34:56.679
- That's just not cool.
- I'm very sorry. Is the gnome okay?

34:56.763 --> 34:58.932
He's fine, sugar. Thanks for asking.

34:59.016 --> 35:00.684
But I wouldn't trust these boys.

35:00.767 --> 35:03.729
Gnome kicking says a lot
about a man's character.

35:03.812 --> 35:06.732
Yes. I'm gonna go
take care of this. Thanks.

35:12.571 --> 35:13.739
What are you doing?

35:13.822 --> 35:15.199
- You live here?
- Yes, I do.

35:15.282 --> 35:18.660
I'm supposed to install a DSL
for a Lorelai Gilmore. Is that you?

35:18.744 --> 35:20.204
- Yes, that's me.
- I'm Mick.

35:20.245 --> 35:22.456
Nice to meet you.
Could you get off my porch?

35:22.539 --> 35:25.626
I was told to look for a ceramic frog
with a key in it.

35:25.709 --> 35:27.878
- I don't understand.
- We can't find the frog.

35:27.961 --> 35:32.007
- I didn't order a DSL.
- The order was placed by Emily Gilmore.

35:32.633 --> 35:33.634
No.

35:33.717 --> 35:36.762
We would've been done,
but the frog search put us way behind.

35:36.845 --> 35:37.930
Look.

35:38.805 --> 35:40.349
- I found it.
- You found the frog.

35:40.432 --> 35:43.060
- It was a turtle, not a frog.
- It says here it's a frog.

35:43.143 --> 35:44.436
- It's a turtle.
- Really?

35:44.520 --> 35:47.898
Trust me. Listen, I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to cancel that DSL order.

35:47.981 --> 35:49.399
Sure? It's already paid for.

35:49.483 --> 35:51.860
Yeah, I know, but we don't need a DSL...

35:51.902 --> 35:54.696
so thanks for coming,
and you guys can just go.

35:56.573 --> 35:57.908
Is there a problem?

35:57.991 --> 36:01.453
Nothing Shakespeare couldn't turn
into a really good play.

36:04.832 --> 36:05.958
Let's try another passage.

36:07.918 --> 36:10.045
'The Romanists have,
with great adroitness...

36:10.128 --> 36:12.548
'drawn three walls round themselves...

36:12.589 --> 36:15.926
'with which they have hitherto
protected themselves...

36:16.218 --> 36:20.722
'so that no one could reform them,
whereby Christendom has fallen terribly. '

36:22.432 --> 36:24.685
- Who said this?
- Martin Luther.

36:25.102 --> 36:27.062
Very good, Miss Gilmore.

36:27.145 --> 36:30.524
And what year did Martin Luther
address the Christian nobility?

36:30.566 --> 36:33.068
- 1520.
- Very good, Miss Gilmore.

36:34.403 --> 36:36.321
Until next time, class.

36:42.911 --> 36:44.413
Stay out of my way.

36:44.496 --> 36:47.541
I will make this school a living hell for you.

36:50.085 --> 36:52.004
See you tomorrow, Mary.

36:53.213 --> 36:54.840
The name is Rory.

37:05.893 --> 37:08.228
- Can I help you?
- God, I wish.

37:10.397 --> 37:11.982
What on earth...

37:12.482 --> 37:16.236
- You're not buying us a DSL.
- Lorelai, this is hardly the place.

37:16.320 --> 37:18.530
I canceled the order,
and it's not happening.

37:18.572 --> 37:20.616
But Rory needs the Internet for her school.

37:20.699 --> 37:21.909
We have the Internet.

37:21.992 --> 37:24.703
- This is faster.
- We like our Internet slow, okay?

37:24.745 --> 37:28.040
We can turn it on, walk around,
do a little dance, make a sandwich.

37:28.081 --> 37:31.210
With DSL, there's no dancing, no walking,
and we'd starve.

37:31.293 --> 37:34.004
It'd be all work and no play.
Haven't you seen The Shining?

37:34.087 --> 37:35.672
What on earth are you talking about?

37:35.756 --> 37:38.217
Also, there will be no cars,
no parking spaces.

37:38.258 --> 37:41.178
And all the uniforms
will be supplied by me. The mother.

37:41.220 --> 37:43.222
That's final. There will be no discussion.

37:43.305 --> 37:46.767
- You're being stubborn as usual.
- No, I'm not being stubborn as usual.

37:46.850 --> 37:48.018
I'm being me.

37:48.060 --> 37:51.188
The same person who always needed
to work out her own problems...

37:51.230 --> 37:54.066
and take care of herself,
because that's the way I was born.

37:54.149 --> 37:56.902
- That's how I am!
- Florence, I'm dripping.

37:57.319 --> 38:00.739
I appreciate what you have done for Rory
in paying for her school.

38:00.823 --> 38:03.450
That will not be forgotten. You won't let it.

38:04.117 --> 38:05.744
But she is my daughter.

38:05.828 --> 38:08.622
And I decide how we live, not you.

38:12.835 --> 38:14.211
Now then...

38:15.212 --> 38:17.422
do they validate parking here?

38:17.923 --> 38:20.050
There's a stamp at the desk.

38:21.593 --> 38:22.928
Thank you.

38:40.904 --> 38:42.197
Hey, you.

38:45.659 --> 38:48.495
So, this whole plaid-skirt thing, my idea?

38:48.829 --> 38:50.497
My day sucked, too.

38:50.539 --> 38:52.833
- Promise?
- I swear on my mother's life.

38:53.208 --> 38:55.210
- Not yet.
- Still hugging.

38:56.962 --> 38:59.381
- So, I brought us some coffee.
- Why, I'm shocked.

38:59.423 --> 39:01.049
Triple caps, easy foam.

39:01.133 --> 39:04.386
If that doesn't work,
we'll stick our fingers in a light socket.

39:04.469 --> 39:05.804
Come here.

39:07.764 --> 39:10.767
Wow, what, do they expect you
to get smart all in one day?

39:10.851 --> 39:13.687
- They expect a lot of things.
- So, tell me.

39:14.229 --> 39:17.024
I don't know. It was just one big, long...

39:17.357 --> 39:20.402
scary, tweedy, bad eight hours.

39:20.569 --> 39:23.280
Add some hair spray,
and you've got my day.

39:23.363 --> 39:26.533
One of the girls already hates me.
The guys are weird.

39:26.575 --> 39:29.453
- Weirder than other guys?
- Yeah, they kept calling me Mary.

39:29.536 --> 39:30.704
You're kidding me.

39:30.787 --> 39:34.041
Wow, I can't believe they still say that.

39:34.458 --> 39:37.920
- Why? What does it mean?
- Mary, like Virgin Mary.

39:38.003 --> 39:40.380
It means they think
you look like a goody-goody.

39:40.422 --> 39:42.090
- You're kidding.
- No.

39:42.257 --> 39:45.511
What would they have called me
if they thought I looked like a slut?

39:45.594 --> 39:47.930
They might have added a Magdalene to it.

39:48.013 --> 39:51.475
Biblical insults.
This is an advanced school.

39:57.105 --> 39:59.900
It was so weird
not having you in school today.

39:59.983 --> 40:02.402
I mean, I finally noticed
some of the other kids.

40:02.486 --> 40:04.905
Let me just say, they are a sad lot.

40:04.988 --> 40:08.909
Yeah? Add a couple plaid skirts,
and you've got the Chilton freaks.

40:08.992 --> 40:11.537
- I totally miss you.
- I miss you.

40:12.621 --> 40:14.206
Guys, I have an idea.

40:14.289 --> 40:16.166
What about, on Tuesdays and Thursdays...

40:16.208 --> 40:18.252
when I go to Hartford
for my business class...

40:18.335 --> 40:21.171
what if Lane comes along,
and you guys can shop and study...

40:21.213 --> 40:22.965
and join a cult and shave your heads?

40:23.048 --> 40:26.093
- Really?
- All except the shaving your heads part.

40:26.176 --> 40:28.470
Oh, no. What time is it?

40:29.513 --> 40:30.597
6:30.

40:30.681 --> 40:32.683
- I'm late for dinner.
- Again?

40:32.766 --> 40:36.854
Lane, your mother is gonna kill me
if I keep sending you home fed and happy.

40:36.937 --> 40:40.482
I'm sorry. But she found a website
that sells tofu in bulk.

40:40.566 --> 40:41.859
You're kidding, right?

40:41.900 --> 40:44.486
Yesterday, she went out
and bought a bigger fridge.

40:44.528 --> 40:46.572
Boy, honey, your life is scary.

40:46.655 --> 40:49.158
- Can I have your crust?
- It's the least I can do.

40:49.199 --> 40:50.617
Thanks. Bye.

41:02.254 --> 41:04.298
A pizza for your thoughts.

41:04.882 --> 41:07.593
I wish I could figure out a way
to get Paris off my back.

41:07.676 --> 41:10.053
Yeah, angry chicks are the worst.

41:11.138 --> 41:13.348
When I was in high school, I had a Paris.

41:13.390 --> 41:15.517
- Yeah?
- Yeah, she was horrible.

41:15.601 --> 41:18.937
- How'd you get rid of her?
- I got pregnant and dropped out.

41:19.021 --> 41:22.107
- What if I learn to French braid her hair?
- Even better.

41:22.733 --> 41:25.235
Sweetie, you can't let those kids
get you down.

41:25.319 --> 41:26.487
I know.

41:26.528 --> 41:28.363
Do you want me to talk to anybody?

41:28.447 --> 41:31.283
A parent, a teacher,
a big guy named Moose?

41:31.742 --> 41:34.244
- I'll just figure it out for myself.
- Okay.

41:37.080 --> 41:38.165
What?

41:38.207 --> 41:40.709
I was thinking
about the way Paris' face looked...

41:40.751 --> 41:43.086
when I beat her
to that Martin Luther question.

41:43.170 --> 41:45.297
- Good?
- Fourteen shades of purple.

41:45.380 --> 41:47.883
- Cool.
- Tomorrow I'm shooting for 15.

41:49.843 --> 41:51.803
What do you think of Luke?

41:51.887 --> 41:55.015
- What do you mean?
- I mean, do you think he's cute?

41:55.599 --> 41:58.060
- No. No way.
- No way, what?

41:58.143 --> 42:01.021
- You cannot date Luke.
- I said nothing about dating Luke.

42:01.104 --> 42:04.733
If you date him, you'll break up
and we'll never be able to eat there again.

42:04.817 --> 42:07.486
I repeat, I said nothing about dating Luke.

42:07.986 --> 42:10.614
Date Al from Pancake World,
his food stinks.

42:10.697 --> 42:12.533
I cannot believe what I'm hearing.

42:12.574 --> 42:15.494
Al's food does not stink, Al stinks.

42:16.305 --> 42:22.498
