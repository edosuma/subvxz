-Well, do you think
that Calvin...
-Oh, no, no. Baby, no.

If The Dredge wanted
to kill him, he had ample

Clearly he wants
our son alive.

I'm going too.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.100
So Garvey can lose

Of course, I trust

We'll mix his past and

He will soon beg to pull our

If my master can
read his mind

04:54.967 --> 04:58.400
I can only read
his regrets and fears.

04:58.500 --> 04:59.833

Today he will bring

defines the artist.

- They're called infernals.
- Ah.

41:53.133 --> 41:54.500
Yeah, I know,
it's a lot to take in.

41:54.600 --> 41:56.267
When I first
found out about it,
I couldn't sleep a wink.

41:56.367 --> 41:57.267
Ah. And now?

41:57.367 --> 42:00.467
One wink, sir.

42:00.567 --> 42:01.900
I did pick up a few things
along the way,

42:02.000 --> 42:02.900
thanks to
the Hastings, though.

42:04.300 --> 42:05.733
I guess I'm in their debt.

42:05.833 --> 42:06.667
And yours.

42:06.767 --> 42:08.633
- Sir, I wanna...
- Hold on. Come on.

42:09.700 --> 42:10.933
There you go.

42:11.033 --> 42:12.300
Say hi to your mom and them.

42:12.400 --> 42:13.867
Sir...

42:13.967 --> 42:16.567
I feel like
it's probably best that
the residents not know

42:16.667 --> 42:18.133
what really goes
bump in the night.

42:18.233 --> 42:20.800
[SIGHS] You know,
I've been trying to think
of what to tell my crew.

42:20.900 --> 42:23.100
Gas leak doesn't seem
to cover all the bases.

42:23.200 --> 42:25.133
Teenagers on bath salts.

42:26.033 --> 42:27.333
It's been my go-to.

42:27.433 --> 42:28.833
[CHUCKLES]

42:28.933 --> 42:31.033
Well, my eyes
have been opened.

42:31.133 --> 42:34.267
Not sure there's much
I can do, but if there is,
you just let me know.

42:35.633 --> 42:37.500
Just glad we're on
the same side, sir.
