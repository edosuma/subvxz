All right, ladies of the Castle household,

00:31.404 --> 00:34.406
just a reminder that your
portion for the holiday poem

00:34.440 --> 00:37.409
is due in less than 72 hours.

00:37.443 --> 00:39.044
I just have to do a polish.

00:39.079 --> 00:40.945
I can't wait to see it.
How's yours coming along?

00:40.980 --> 00:42.280
Are you ready for your big debut

00:42.315 --> 00:44.082

00:45.118 --> 00:46.384
Yeah, absolutely.

00:46.419 --> 00:48.553
- It's gonna be the best year ever!
- Yeah. [Laughter]

the past year for you.

01:14.513 --> 01:16.413

You should probably get me your first draft

uh, precinct holiday party.

01:45.309 --> 01:46.442
That's two days away.

01:46.477 --> 01:48.178
See? Plenty of time. [Sighs]

01:48.212 --> 01:49.345
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:49.380 --> 01:51.540
So get ready for a murder
with a little holiday spirit.

01:51.549 --> 01:53.216
Went down around 10:30 p.m.

01:53.250 --> 01:55.885
Witnesses saw a black mustang, no plates,

01:55.919 --> 01:57.487
chasing after this guy.

01:57.521 --> 01:59.489
This was a drive-by?

01:59.523 --> 02:01.491
But he looks like he was shot close range.

02:01.525 --> 02:03.458
Yeah, and the shooter capped him
in the head to finish him off.

02:03.493 --> 02:05.394
So this wasn't random.

02:05.428 --> 02:07.329
Did anyone get a good
look at the assailant?

02:07.363 --> 02:09.497
Yeah,
when he drove by like a bat out of hell.

02:09.532 --> 02:11.967
Fuzzy red hat, big white beard.

02:12.002 --> 02:14.536
Seriously, our killer is Santa Claus?

Three witnesses all told the same story.

02:19.409 --> 02:21.743
Delivering millions of
presents in one night?

02:21.777 --> 02:23.545
It's bound to happen.

02:23.580 --> 02:26.081
Santa finally cracked.

02:26.115 --> 02:27.382
Or...

02:27.417 --> 02:28.750
our victim was naughty instead of nice.

02:28.784 --> 02:30.885
Castle and Esposito: [Laughing]

02:30.920 --> 02:32.321
That's tasteless.

02:32.355 --> 02:33.555
Or a killer just wore a Santa suit

02:33.590 --> 02:36.191
because that was the perfect
disguise at this time of year.

02:36.225 --> 02:38.093
So what do we know about the victim?

02:38.127 --> 02:40.829
His name is Eric Mercer. Lives in midtown.

02:40.863 --> 02:43.832
His hospital I.D. says he's
an E.R. doctor at St. Simon's.

02:43.866 --> 02:46.334
- Do we know where he was coming from?
- Not yet,

02:46.368 --> 02:48.036
but he bought a latte at a coffee shop

02:48.070 --> 02:49.070
six blocks away from here

02:49.105 --> 02:52.173
before our gun-toting
St. Nick came after him.

02:52.208 --> 02:53.374
And the barista there said that

02:53.408 --> 02:54.542
Mercer was carrying a blue backpack.

02:54.576 --> 02:56.611
But witnesses who saw Mercer running

02:56.645 --> 02:57.845
said there wasn't any backpack.

02:57.879 --> 03:00.548
Okay, let's set up a search
from here to that coffee shop.

03:00.582 --> 03:03.584
That backpack may contain
clues as to why he was killed.

03:03.619 --> 03:06.053
Well,
maybe the last person that Mercer talked to

03:06.087 --> 03:07.588
can shed some light on that.

03:07.623 --> 03:08.656
10 minutes before he was shot,

03:08.690 --> 03:11.591
Eric Mercer called someone
at St. Simon's hospital.

03:11.942 --> 03:15.729
That was me.
I just talked to Eric a few hours ago.

03:15.764 --> 03:18.465
I'm sorry. This is just such a shock.

03:18.499 --> 03:20.134
How did he seem when you talked?

03:20.168 --> 03:22.535
A little on edge, I guess...
like he was in a hurry.

03:22.570 --> 03:24.271
Did he say why?

03:24.305 --> 03:26.239
I assume it was his uncle.

03:26.274 --> 03:28.541
His uncle has cancer and lives alone.

03:28.576 --> 03:29.876
Eric tried to be there for him.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.811
He missed work last night, too.

03:31.845 --> 03:33.112
Do you know his name?

03:33.147 --> 03:35.448
Edward, I think. Edward Mercer.

03:35.483 --> 03:37.450
Maybe he knows why this happened to Eric.

03:39.787 --> 03:41.454
- Hey!
- Hey.

03:41.489 --> 03:42.822
What you got for me, girl?

03:42.856 --> 03:46.259
I found these on the
arm of the vic's jacket.

03:46.293 --> 03:48.127
Some kind of tiny crystals.

03:48.162 --> 03:50.263
Could they be from the christmas
decorations that he landed on

03:50.297 --> 03:51.597
after he crashed through the window?

03:51.631 --> 03:53.933
No, these are mineral crystals. Mm.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.601
Hopefully the lab can I.D. them.

03:57.504 --> 04:00.272
Hang on. You always call me down here

04:00.307 --> 04:02.441
after the lab results are in,

04:02.475 --> 04:04.510
which leads me to believe that you may have

04:04.544 --> 04:06.945
some ulterior motives.

04:06.979 --> 04:10.282
Javi, I want to ask a little favor.

04:10.317 --> 04:11.317
Anything you need.

04:11.318 --> 04:15.620
So...
My parents barely ever leave Louisiana,

04:15.654 --> 04:17.588
and they're flying out to Paris tomorrow,

04:17.623 --> 04:20.757
and they have a last-minute
layover in New York.

04:20.793 --> 04:23.594
They want us all to get together.

04:23.629 --> 04:26.497
[Swallows]So it's, uh,

04:26.532 --> 04:27.866

04:27.900 --> 04:29.801
Are you okay with that?

04:29.836 --> 04:31.636
[Scoffs]Yeah.

04:31.670 --> 04:33.671
Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?

04:33.706 --> 04:37.608
That's not even really a favor.
That's just me stepping up.

04:37.643 --> 04:39.510
Mm-hmm.

04:39.545 --> 04:43.047
See, I didn't get to the favor part...

04:43.081 --> 04:45.516
[Sets clipboard down]...yet.

04:45.551 --> 04:47.852
What?

04:47.886 --> 04:49.353
You didn't?

04:49.387 --> 04:50.554
See, um...

04:50.588 --> 04:53.623
My parents... [Chuckles nervously]

04:53.658 --> 04:56.626
my...
my parents kind of think we're engaged.

04:56.661 --> 04:59.463
Wh-why do they think that?

04:59.497 --> 05:01.698
Well, you and I were on again, off again,

05:01.733 --> 05:03.200
and they just got so worried about

05:03.235 --> 05:04.735
their unmarried daughter that...

05:04.769 --> 05:06.336
So you told them we got engaged?

05:06.371 --> 05:09.305
I didn't mean to. It just... popped out.

05:09.340 --> 05:11.341
How does something like that just pop out?

05:11.376 --> 05:13.076
I wanted them to stop bugging me.

05:13.110 --> 05:14.745
I'm sorry, Javi, but once I said it,

05:14.779 --> 05:17.581
there it was, and now here they are.

05:17.615 --> 05:19.549
So the first time I meet your parents,

05:19.584 --> 05:21.351
you're asking me to lie to them?

05:21.385 --> 05:23.887
I'll be lying to them, too,
but I've been doing it longer.

05:25.089 --> 05:26.689
Wow.

05:26.723 --> 05:30.026
Uh... can I... just...

05:30.060 --> 05:33.229
bring
'em down to the precinct to say hello?

05:33.264 --> 05:37.333
And you could just pretend for 10 minutes.

05:37.368 --> 05:39.902
I'll make it worth your while.

05:39.936 --> 05:42.571
Y-yeah, yeah. I-I can do that.

05:42.606 --> 05:44.172
Mmm.

05:44.207 --> 05:46.776
So we looked into Eric's family history,

05:46.810 --> 05:50.012
contacts in his phone and computer.

05:50.046 --> 05:52.715
He does not have an uncle
named Edward Mercer.

05:52.749 --> 05:54.950
In fact, he doesn't have an uncle at all.

05:54.984 --> 05:58.387
Then why did he miss his shift,
and where did he go?

05:58.421 --> 05:59.922
I may have an answer to that.

05:59.956 --> 06:01.556
It turns out that Eric

06:01.590 --> 06:04.559
used the Hytch Ride
Share app to catch a ride

06:04.593 --> 06:06.628
to an address in Queens tonight

06:06.662 --> 06:08.363
a couple of hours before he was killed.

06:08.398 --> 06:10.765
In fact,
he took numerous trips to that same address

06:10.800 --> 06:12.634
which line up with shifts that
he missed at the hospital.

06:12.668 --> 06:14.235
And what's at this location?

06:14.269 --> 06:15.603
Certainly not Uncle Edward.

06:15.638 --> 06:17.572
Offices. It's an office building

06:17.606 --> 06:20.642
owned by Evergreen Sanitation N.Y.C.

06:20.676 --> 06:22.777
Are you sure about that?

06:22.812 --> 06:25.747
Evergreen Sanitation N.Y.C.
is a known front

06:25.781 --> 06:27.415
for organized crime.

06:27.449 --> 06:29.616
Why would Eric Mercer be
visiting a mob-owned building?

06:29.651 --> 06:32.629
Let's head to Queens and find out.

06:33.822 --> 06:35.622
No placards, no names.

06:35.657 --> 06:37.658
It's like this whole place is unoccupied.

06:37.692 --> 06:39.726
And yet Eric missed work to come here...

06:39.761 --> 06:40.761
repeatedly.

No.

07:22.673 --> 07:25.820
Well, we believe that he might
have been a family doctor

07:25.840 --> 07:28.408
for whoever controls
Evergreen Sanitation N.Y.C.

07:28.442 --> 07:30.043
Yeah, that's the Carlucci family.

07:30.078 --> 07:31.544
They've been moving up the charts

07:31.579 --> 07:33.146
since Dino Scarpella took over.

07:33.181 --> 07:34.647
But I didn't know that they had a doctor.

07:34.682 --> 07:37.084
Whoa.
Um, Dino Scarpella... I know that guy.

07:37.118 --> 07:38.285
Seriously?

07:38.319 --> 07:40.187
Yeah, he helped me with research
for a Derrick Storm novel,

07:40.221 --> 07:42.188
but back then he was just a mid-level guy.

07:42.222 --> 07:44.691
Detective McBride, if Eric was a doctor

07:44.725 --> 07:46.259
for the Carlucci family,
do you have any idea

07:46.293 --> 07:47.460
why he would have been targeted?

07:47.495 --> 07:49.262
I haven't heard anything,
if that's what you're asking me.

07:49.296 --> 07:51.097
But, uh, the way he was killed,

07:51.131 --> 07:52.851
sounds like somebody was sending a message.

07:52.867 --> 07:54.701
Where would we find Dino Scarpella?

07:54.735 --> 07:56.703
Uh, his main offices are over in Queens.

07:56.737 --> 08:00.239
It's a strip club called
Cica Cica Boom Room.

08:00.274 --> 08:02.241
- Why?
- Well, we should go talk to him.

08:02.276 --> 08:04.043
Dino knows me. He likes me.

08:04.077 --> 08:06.512
If Eric was his mob doctor,
he'd want to help solve this.

08:53.024 --> 08:55.392
- Rick, is that really you?
- Dino!

08:55.427 --> 08:57.328
Oh, man. Do you know

08:57.362 --> 08:59.002
I just finished your book, "Raging Heat"?

08:59.030 --> 09:00.598
- Really?
- Terrific. Wonderful story.

09:00.632 --> 09:02.232
- Thank you.
- Wonderful, yeah.

09:02.267 --> 09:04.234
So what brings you here?

09:04.269 --> 09:05.902
And who is this Venus?

09:05.937 --> 09:07.838
Dino, this is my wife...

09:07.872 --> 09:09.306
- Wow.
- Kate Beckett.

09:09.341 --> 09:12.242
Detective Beckett, N.Y.P.D.

09:12.277 --> 09:14.111
Uh, she's... she's okay.

09:14.145 --> 09:16.146
I'm actually consulting
with the police now,

09:16.181 --> 09:19.516
and we're here for your help
in a murder investigation.

09:19.550 --> 09:22.285
For you, Rick, I'm happy to help.

09:22.319 --> 09:24.153
And the boys are, too.

09:24.188 --> 09:28.324
Rocco Carlucci...
he's my, uh, my chief of security.

09:28.359 --> 09:29.759
And this is Christopher Carlucci,

09:29.794 --> 09:32.195
V.P. of corporate affairs. Who got whacked?

09:32.229 --> 09:35.765
A, uh, Dr. Eric Mercer.

09:40.371 --> 09:42.838
Um...

09:42.873 --> 09:45.274
Yeah, I do not recognize this person.

09:46.810 --> 09:49.612
Mr. Scarpella, we've connected Dr. Mercer

09:49.646 --> 09:52.482
to a surgical suite paid
for by your organization.

09:52.516 --> 09:54.517
Dino, we know Eric worked for you,

09:54.551 --> 09:56.351
but who would want to do this to him?

09:56.386 --> 09:57.653
Can you help us out?

09:57.687 --> 09:59.454
Sadly, I have no help to offer.

09:59.489 --> 10:01.857
But please, stay, enjoy yourselves.

10:01.892 --> 10:03.659
It's on the house.

10:03.693 --> 10:04.527
Uh, Mr. Scarpella...

10:04.561 --> 10:07.730
like he said, we got nothing for you.

10:07.764 --> 10:10.365
[Cell phone rings]

10:10.400 --> 10:12.234
[Beep]

10:12.268 --> 10:16.004
Hey, Espo. So while you and Castle
were busy getting lap dances,

10:16.039 --> 10:17.805
Ryan and I did some real police work.

10:17.840 --> 10:20.142
We found a Carlucci
connection to the murder.

10:20.176 --> 10:22.144
Yeah... wait, what kind of a connection?

10:22.178 --> 10:23.478
Turns out the family's number two,

10:23.513 --> 10:26.415
Christopher Carlucci, owns a black mustang.

10:26.449 --> 10:28.349
Guess what was stashed inside.

10:28.383 --> 10:31.019
A Santa suit... with blood on it.

10:32.454 --> 10:34.522
Christopher Carlucci,

10:34.557 --> 10:36.223
we need to talk.

10:36.258 --> 10:38.259
Why did you kill Eric Mercer?

10:38.293 --> 10:39.894
I didn't.

10:39.929 --> 10:42.229
Okay,
then why don't you clear this up for me?

10:42.264 --> 10:44.331
Where were you at the time of the murder?

10:44.366 --> 10:47.368
And why did witnesses see your
mustang at the crime scene?

10:47.402 --> 10:50.104
And why did we find a Santa suit

10:50.138 --> 10:53.640
stuffed in the trunk of your car
with Eric's blood on it?

10:56.744 --> 10:59.280
Look, Christopher,
I don't think you just woke up one morning

10:59.314 --> 11:01.414
and decided to kill the family doctor.

11:01.449 --> 11:03.416
That kind of order comes from above.

11:05.053 --> 11:08.221
Did Dino Scarpella give the order?

11:09.390 --> 11:11.291
[Breathes sharply]

11:14.462 --> 11:16.229
I want a lawyer.

11:18.299 --> 11:21.134
I wonder why the Carluccis
would kill their own doctor.

11:21.168 --> 11:23.369
Maybe he saw something he shouldn't have,

11:23.404 --> 11:25.271
let the wrong mobster die on his table.

11:25.306 --> 11:26.439
Yeah.
[Cell phone rings]

11:26.474 --> 11:28.280
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

11:28.300 --> 11:30.042
[Beep]

11:30.077 --> 11:31.478
Richard Castle.

11:31.512 --> 11:35.047
Dino: Rick, we need to talk.

11:35.082 --> 11:38.250
He said he wanted you to
meet him at the strip club?

11:38.284 --> 11:39.418
Why?

11:39.452 --> 11:41.386
He just said that it was urgent.

11:41.421 --> 11:44.423
And when Dino Scarpella
issues an invitation,

11:44.457 --> 11:45.691
you don't R.S.V.P. with "no."

11:45.726 --> 11:48.327
Yeah, you do, especially if he
put a hit out on Eric Mercer.

11:48.361 --> 11:51.663
He called me at the precinct.
He knows I'm married to you.

11:51.697 --> 11:53.398
I-I'm in no danger here.

11:53.433 --> 11:55.467
Oh, God, Castle,
this just sounds like an epitaph.

11:55.502 --> 11:58.403
Um... You know what? I'm gonna go with you.

11:58.438 --> 12:00.272
He said to come alone.

12:00.306 --> 12:02.774
You're gonna have to trust me on this.

12:02.808 --> 12:05.844
Dino... He's an honorable man.

12:05.878 --> 12:09.047
Yeah, well,
I bet that's what Eric thought, too.

12:15.121 --> 12:17.421
Buy yourself something nice with it, okay?

12:17.456 --> 12:20.358
Take your mind off this tragedy.

12:20.392 --> 12:22.093
And don't tell your mother, okay?

12:22.128 --> 12:24.728
[Sniffles]Thanks, daddy. [Kisses]

12:26.465 --> 12:28.132
Jane.

12:28.167 --> 12:30.034
The roll of cash she spends on clothes

12:30.068 --> 12:31.602
could choke a horse. [Door closes]

12:31.637 --> 12:33.971
I even bought an imitation couture company,

12:34.005 --> 12:35.873
but the fake stuff isn't
good enough for my girl.

12:35.907 --> 12:38.376
Right? Especially now that she's upset.

12:38.410 --> 12:40.878
She and Eric... they were very close,

12:40.912 --> 12:43.013
very close since they were kids.

12:43.048 --> 12:44.648
So you're admitting he was your doctor.

12:44.683 --> 12:47.184
I don't like that word "admit."

12:48.586 --> 12:49.887
"Acknowledging"?

12:49.921 --> 12:53.057
Wow, Rick, me and you...

12:53.091 --> 12:55.458
we had a good relationship once, huh?

12:55.493 --> 12:56.859
We still do, don't we?

12:56.894 --> 12:58.228
Well, I don't know. I...

12:58.262 --> 13:00.463
I need to know I can speak freely.

13:00.498 --> 13:03.500
That you're not gonna turn around and
repeat what I say to the authorities.

13:03.534 --> 13:05.335
Dino...

13:05.369 --> 13:07.103
You can trust me.

13:10.208 --> 13:12.041
Eric was family.

13:13.510 --> 13:14.911
My cousin's Bruno's kid,

13:14.945 --> 13:18.214
by a girl he had on the side.

13:18.248 --> 13:21.050
Bruno... he died in the slammer,

13:21.085 --> 13:22.752
so I looked after Eric.

13:22.786 --> 13:24.854
I sent him to the best schools.

13:24.888 --> 13:27.489
I didn't want him to work for the family,
but...

13:27.524 --> 13:29.525
If you want to hear God laugh,
you tell him...

13:29.559 --> 13:30.926
tell him all your plans, right?

13:30.960 --> 13:32.994
So what happened?

13:33.029 --> 13:34.530
[Clicks tongue] A few years back,

13:34.564 --> 13:36.765
one of my guys got shot. It happens.

13:36.799 --> 13:38.934
He would have croaked, but Eric stepped up.

13:38.968 --> 13:40.603
Next thing I know...

13:40.637 --> 13:44.440
Next thing I know,
he's got a taste for the life.

13:44.474 --> 13:46.708
I need to find out who did this to him.

13:46.743 --> 13:48.844
Don't take this the wrong way, Dino,

13:48.878 --> 13:51.613
- but I think you already do know.
- It was not Christopher.

13:51.647 --> 13:53.949
- All the evidence says that it was.
- He was framed.

13:53.983 --> 13:56.752
He's innocent...
when it comes to this, anyway.

13:56.786 --> 13:59.788
I know... because I was with him.

13:59.822 --> 14:02.690
Dino, if that's true,
all we have to do is call Beckett.

14:02.725 --> 14:05.126
- You can alibi him.
- Mm, no, that's no good.

14:05.160 --> 14:07.629
See, at the time,
me and Christopher, we were,

14:07.663 --> 14:09.930
uh, engaged in a sensitive
business transaction.

14:09.965 --> 14:12.700
And by "sensitive," you mean "illegal."

14:12.735 --> 14:14.435
I don't like that word either.

14:14.470 --> 14:15.737
My point is this...

14:15.771 --> 14:18.572
the cops are not looking for Eric's killer

14:18.606 --> 14:20.474
because they think they already got him.

14:20.508 --> 14:21.608
Even if they are out looking for him,

14:21.643 --> 14:24.311
nobody in my world's gonna give
'em the time of day.

14:24.345 --> 14:25.913
And this is where you come in.

14:25.947 --> 14:27.447
- Me?
- Yeah.

14:27.482 --> 14:29.583
I need you to prove Christopher's innocence

14:29.617 --> 14:31.618
and find Eric's killer.

14:31.653 --> 14:34.554
See,
nobody connected's gonna talk to the cops,

14:34.589 --> 14:36.590
but if I vouch for you,

14:36.624 --> 14:39.559
give you access no cop has ever gotten...

14:39.594 --> 14:41.561
Dino, I don't know if I'm...

14:41.596 --> 14:43.430
I could crack a joke
about making you an offer

14:43.464 --> 14:45.465
you can't refuse.

14:45.500 --> 14:47.367
But you cannot refuse.

14:48.703 --> 14:50.069
Understood.

14:50.104 --> 14:51.437
Good.

14:51.471 --> 14:53.273
But if I figure out who did this,

14:53.307 --> 14:55.608
you have to let me bring
the killer to justice.

14:55.642 --> 14:58.644
And by "justice," I mean legal justice,

14:58.679 --> 14:59.679
not just taking him out.

14:59.680 --> 15:04.250
When the time comes,
I need to call Beckett.

15:04.285 --> 15:06.452
We will swear by the code of silence.

15:09.656 --> 15:12.425
[Slices] Omerta?

15:13.694 --> 15:14.960
[Slices] Ow!

15:14.994 --> 15:17.763
[Knife clatters, slap] Ow!

15:17.798 --> 15:21.200
You're blood now, Rick.

15:21.234 --> 15:22.935
You're family.

15:25.238 --> 15:27.639
Do not let me down.

15:29.632 --> 15:31.200
So let me get this straight.

15:31.234 --> 15:33.135
You want to reinvestigate Eric's murder

15:33.169 --> 15:37.176
on behalf of your friend Dino the mob boss?

15:37.196 --> 15:39.379
Okay, well, when you put it like that,
it sounds bad.

15:39.399 --> 15:40.790
It sounds bad no matter how I put it.

15:40.810 --> 15:43.358
Castle, we have the killer.

15:43.378 --> 15:44.845
Christopher was with Dino at the time.

15:44.879 --> 15:46.314
According to Dino.

15:46.348 --> 15:48.216
Dino is playing you.

15:48.250 --> 15:50.151
Mobsters get arrested.

15:50.185 --> 15:52.220
It's a cost of doing business.
Dino knows that.

15:52.254 --> 15:54.555
So why go through the trouble
of asking me to look into it

15:54.590 --> 15:56.224
unless Christopher was innocent?

15:56.258 --> 15:58.025
Firstly, he didn't exactly ask you,

15:58.059 --> 16:00.500
and secondly,
he just wants his number two back.

16:00.718 --> 16:03.289
Well, there's more to it than that.

16:04.298 --> 16:05.499
Omerta.

16:05.533 --> 16:08.068
We made the blood oath.

16:08.103 --> 16:10.403
It was not my idea,
and I did not have a choice.

16:10.438 --> 16:13.406
So you believe Dino because
he gave you a paper cut?

16:13.441 --> 16:16.109
Look, if I look into Eric's murder

16:16.144 --> 16:19.613
and the trail leads back to
Christopher Carlucci, so be it.

16:19.647 --> 16:21.448
But if it doesn't,

16:21.482 --> 16:23.816
don't you want to know
who the real killer is?

16:27.054 --> 16:27.954
[Clicks tongue]Fine.

16:27.988 --> 16:29.956
But you have to promise that Captain Gates

16:29.990 --> 16:31.524
isn't gonna find out
that we're poking around

16:31.558 --> 16:32.859
an already closed case.

16:32.893 --> 16:35.194
And... you have to keep me looped in

16:35.228 --> 16:36.963
- every step of the way.
- I promise.

16:36.997 --> 16:38.965
And since Dino gave me an all-access pass

16:38.999 --> 16:41.134
with the family,
I'm gonna start by talking to Christopher.

16:41.168 --> 16:43.670
[Kisses] Thank you.

16:46.239 --> 16:49.074
I heard Scarpella and
Castle had a sit-down.

16:49.108 --> 16:50.442
What do you think that's about?

16:50.477 --> 16:51.977
I don't know.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.445
But I don't like him
going around us like this.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.314
- Mm.
- Hey, baby!

16:55.348 --> 16:56.382
Hey!

16:58.351 --> 16:59.451
[High-pitched]Hey!

16:59.486 --> 17:03.622
Javier, these are my parents...
Walter and Melinda.

17:03.657 --> 17:06.157
- How you doing?
- Ooh, oh. Okay. [Laughs]

17:06.192 --> 17:08.626
We're huggers in the Parish family, son.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.627
And go ahead. Call me "dad."

17:10.663 --> 17:12.450
Oh. Okay.

17:14.934 --> 17:19.137
Ooh! I can see where Lanie
gets her beautiful eyes from.

17:19.172 --> 17:20.571
And her medical brain must come from you.

17:20.606 --> 17:21.972
I hear that you're a surgeon.

17:22.007 --> 17:24.075
Cardiothoracic. But retired.

17:24.108 --> 17:27.679
No shop talk, dear. The only talk I want

17:27.713 --> 17:29.914
is to hear the story.

17:29.948 --> 17:33.117
- What story?
- The proposal, of course.

17:33.151 --> 17:37.121
Oh! That story! Right. [Laughs]

17:37.155 --> 17:39.556
Javi?

17:40.692 --> 17:42.993
Yes, the story. Um...

17:43.028 --> 17:44.829
Uh, we, um...

17:44.863 --> 17:46.863
You know, baby,
you tell it so much better than me.

17:46.865 --> 17:48.298
Why don't you...

17:48.333 --> 17:50.267
This guy! You should have seen him.

17:50.301 --> 17:51.869
He rolls Lanie

17:51.903 --> 17:53.670
out into the middle of the
Central Park boat pond.

17:53.705 --> 17:55.472
He gets down on one knee,

17:55.506 --> 17:58.342
so nervous he nearly capsizes the boat.

17:58.376 --> 17:59.843
Almost sends them both into the water.

17:59.877 --> 18:02.379
[Gasps]That's just what Lanie did when...

18:02.413 --> 18:04.715
She saw that ring.

18:04.749 --> 18:07.351
- Ah. Perfect fit.
- Yeah.

18:07.385 --> 18:10.987
I'm Kevin, by the way...
Espo's partner and, you know,

18:11.021 --> 18:13.156
proposal planner-in-crime. [Laughs]

18:13.190 --> 18:16.292
That's so romantic.
I want to hear all about the courtship.

18:16.326 --> 18:18.394
I just wish we had time for all of that,

18:18.428 --> 18:20.363
but, you know,
with us having to get back to work

18:20.397 --> 18:22.232
and...
and you having to catch your plane...

18:22.266 --> 18:23.233
Actually, I just got a text

18:23.267 --> 18:24.667
that our flight's been
delayed till tomorrow.

18:24.701 --> 18:27.069
[Gasps]So why don't we all go out
and have dinner a little later?

18:27.103 --> 18:28.904
[Laughs nervously]Ohh!

18:28.938 --> 18:31.407
Yes, that sounds great, Walter.

18:31.441 --> 18:33.676
I mean... Dad.

18:33.710 --> 18:35.378
[Doors clatter]

18:35.412 --> 18:37.179
You sure he's good?

18:39.349 --> 18:41.751
Ask your questions.
I'll tell you what I know.

18:41.785 --> 18:43.418
Thanks.

18:43.452 --> 18:45.587
So... [exhales]

18:45.621 --> 18:47.256
Dino says you were set up.

18:47.290 --> 18:48.857
So who'd want to frame you?

18:48.892 --> 18:50.325
[Scoffs]

18:50.359 --> 18:52.661
I'm his right-hand man.

18:52.695 --> 18:55.430
I know 50 guys who would slit my throat...

18:55.464 --> 18:56.899
[Snaps fingers]...like that.

18:56.933 --> 18:58.400
But they'd kill me.

18:58.434 --> 19:01.068
Not one of 'em would frame me.

19:01.103 --> 19:04.071
All right, then let's talk about Eric.

19:04.106 --> 19:07.875
Eric, uh, recently had some concerns.

19:07.910 --> 19:10.378
Concerns that someone was after him?

19:10.413 --> 19:12.380
Not exactly. Uh...

19:12.415 --> 19:15.350
See, Eric being our doctor...

19:15.384 --> 19:17.051
we kept that secret.

19:17.085 --> 19:20.354
You know,
so he could have a life outside the family.

19:20.388 --> 19:23.424
But I guess he was afraid
that his secret got out,

19:23.458 --> 19:25.526
because a few days ago, he comes to me

19:25.560 --> 19:27.261
and he asks a favor.

19:27.296 --> 19:29.130
What kind of a favor?

19:29.164 --> 19:32.266
He wanted phone tap detectors.

19:32.301 --> 19:34.267
You know, tracing equipment.

19:34.302 --> 19:35.902
He thought he was being watched.

19:35.937 --> 19:37.538
- By whom?
- I don't know.

19:37.572 --> 19:39.573
You know, at the time,
I thought he was just being paranoid.

19:39.607 --> 19:43.310
But I wanted to be safe, so, I, uh,

19:43.345 --> 19:46.447
I hooked him up with Cyber Rita.

19:48.149 --> 19:49.382
Are you morons ready?

19:49.416 --> 19:52.485
I'm cutting the alarm in 3, 2, 1...

19:52.519 --> 19:54.321
[Key clicks, beep] Bam!

19:54.355 --> 19:56.223
Yeah, I helped the doc.

19:56.257 --> 19:58.458
Well, did Eric tell you who
he thought was watching him?

19:58.492 --> 20:01.061
- What are you talking about?
- When he asked for

20:01.095 --> 20:02.329
the countersurveillance equipment.

20:02.363 --> 20:04.097
That's not what he asked me for.

20:05.099 --> 20:06.131
It isn't?

20:06.166 --> 20:09.435
No. Christopher called me
and told me to give Eric

20:09.470 --> 20:11.671
whatever he needed, so I did.

20:11.705 --> 20:13.005
And what did Eric need?

20:13.039 --> 20:14.940
Well, it sounds like

20:14.975 --> 20:17.510
Eric told Christopher one thing,
and me another.

20:17.544 --> 20:19.679
So I'm not gonna say another word

20:19.713 --> 20:21.514
until I'm sure that lurch over there

20:21.548 --> 20:23.515
isn't gonna have me
sleeping with the fishes.

20:23.549 --> 20:25.150
Uh, lurch, would you...

20:25.185 --> 20:26.986
Rocco, I mean, could you...

20:28.721 --> 20:30.923
He wanted hot credit cards.

20:30.957 --> 20:32.491
Stolen credit cards? What for?

20:32.525 --> 20:35.361
So he could buy things and
not have to pay for them.

20:35.395 --> 20:37.829
- Thank you. That's...
- I gave him a dozen,

20:37.864 --> 20:39.765
so each is good for about 2 grand

20:39.799 --> 20:41.366
before it needs to be tossed.

20:41.401 --> 20:43.435
Did Eric say why he needed $24,000?

20:43.469 --> 20:45.370
Maybe for wheels?

20:45.405 --> 20:46.838
He asked if he could use the card to access

20:46.873 --> 20:48.874
a swipe-and-go car rental, but I told him

20:48.908 --> 20:50.842
he was definitely gonna need a
fake I.D. to go with the card.

20:50.877 --> 20:53.011
Okay, could you e-mail me
those credit card numbers

20:53.045 --> 20:54.646
- so I can see if he used them?
- Yeah. Oh!

20:54.680 --> 20:56.480
[Alarm ringing] Aah!

20:56.515 --> 20:58.449
Which of you idiots just
triggered the security door?

20:58.483 --> 21:01.352
Stolen credit cards,
a possible getaway car.

21:01.387 --> 21:03.454
Sounds like Eric was
about to go on the run.

21:03.488 --> 21:05.456
Only the killer got to him first.

21:05.490 --> 21:07.691
Okay, so if Christopher didn't kill him,
then who did?

21:07.726 --> 21:09.627
Maybe whatever Eric was
charging on those cards

21:09.661 --> 21:10.962
could give us a lead.

21:10.996 --> 21:13.196
Unfortunately, cards are a bust.

21:13.231 --> 21:14.998
I ran the numbers. No recent activity.

21:15.033 --> 21:16.834
- Did we ever find those cards?
- Uh, no.

21:16.868 --> 21:18.636
Not in his hospital locker or his apartment

21:18.670 --> 21:21.305
- or on his body.
- Maybe the killer took them.

21:21.339 --> 21:22.807
Well, I'll have Tory monitor the numbers,

21:22.841 --> 21:24.542
see if any activity pops.

21:24.576 --> 21:26.243
Think I got a lead.
So we're really thinking

21:26.277 --> 21:28.504
that this killer is not
Christopher Carlucci, right?

21:28.524 --> 21:29.160
Yes.

21:29.180 --> 21:31.381
- Maybe.
- No.

21:31.416 --> 21:33.417
Oh, come on. The guy is guilty.

21:33.451 --> 21:35.419
Nobody thought otherwise
until Castle over here

21:35.453 --> 21:36.987
started moonlighting for the mob.

21:37.021 --> 21:38.655
I think that might be
overstating it a little.

21:38.689 --> 21:40.190
You took a blood oath.

21:40.224 --> 21:42.559
You let them turn you
into an honorary mobster.

21:42.593 --> 21:44.661
- What's wrong with you?
- Oh, come on, man.

21:44.695 --> 21:47.096
How many people outside of the mafia

21:47.130 --> 21:48.897
ever get to swear Omerta?

21:48.932 --> 21:51.167
I think it is a...
experience of a lifetime.

21:51.201 --> 21:53.669
- Of course you would.
- Didn't you say you had a lead?

21:53.703 --> 21:56.072
Yeah.
The lab was able to identify the crystals

21:56.106 --> 21:57.673
that Lanie found on Eric's sleeves.

21:57.707 --> 21:59.442
They're made up of sodium ferrocyanide

21:59.476 --> 22:01.610
mixed with sodium chloride, which means...

22:01.644 --> 22:04.546
It's road salt. It hasn't snowed in weeks.

22:04.581 --> 22:07.215
So why would Eric be literally
up to his elbows in salt?

22:07.249 --> 22:09.451
I don't know.
But there are only four salt depots

22:09.486 --> 22:11.520
on the island,
and one of them happens to be

22:11.554 --> 22:13.555
within three blocks of our crime scene.

22:13.575 --> 22:14.831
The blue backpack.

22:14.851 --> 22:16.625
But we searched for it.
We never found it.

22:16.659 --> 22:19.194
That's because just before Eric died,
he hid that bag.

22:19.228 --> 22:21.242
The salt depot.

22:23.265 --> 22:25.867
Man, the places we go to follow a lead.

22:25.901 --> 22:28.136
But if it points to our killer,
it's worth it indeed.

22:28.170 --> 22:30.972
If that's you trying to
help me with my poem,

22:31.007 --> 22:32.540
then it's not working.

22:33.675 --> 22:35.610
Right over here.

22:35.644 --> 22:38.312
This is where Eric gained access.

22:38.346 --> 22:40.748
Wait, is that the, uh... right there.

22:42.000 --> 22:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

22:49.858 --> 22:52.459
The victim's blue backpack. You were right.

22:52.494 --> 22:54.161
Eric must have stashed it
here before he was killed.

22:54.195 --> 22:56.096
But what was he trying to hide

22:56.131 --> 22:59.174
that he didn't want anyone to find?
[Unzips backpack]

23:01.602 --> 23:03.170
Bloody clothes?

23:03.204 --> 23:05.227
With bullet holes.

23:06.287 --> 23:07.367
Here's what I can tell you.

23:07.388 --> 23:08.688
The guy who wore these clothes

23:08.723 --> 23:11.838
was about 6 feet, maybe 180, 200 pounds.

23:11.858 --> 23:13.858
- What about his injuries?
- Two shots to the back.

23:13.860 --> 23:15.961
Both bullets exited the front of his body.

23:15.995 --> 23:18.029
Based on where he was hit
and the amount of blood,

23:18.064 --> 23:19.597
he probably didn't survive.

23:19.631 --> 23:21.266
So did any stiffs come in
with those kinds of wounds?

23:21.300 --> 23:23.868
- Minus his clothes, of course.
- No. I already checked.

23:23.902 --> 23:25.703
Can you tell when he was shot?

23:25.737 --> 23:28.873
Blood coagulation says it
was within the last two days.

23:28.907 --> 23:31.176
Eric missed work two days ago,
and his hytch app showed

23:31.210 --> 23:33.478
that he went to that
surgical suite in Queens.

23:33.512 --> 23:35.380
So then maybe this was
one of his mob patients.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.682
He wasn't...
at least not according to Dino.

23:37.716 --> 23:39.450
No recent gunshot wounds in the family,

23:39.485 --> 23:41.853
and Eric hadn't treated
anyone in the past week.

23:41.887 --> 23:43.621
Then Eric must have treated someone else,

23:43.655 --> 23:45.623
someone not connected to the Carluccis.

23:45.657 --> 23:47.992
Could that mean that Eric operated

23:48.026 --> 23:49.894
on someone from another family?

23:49.928 --> 23:52.329
If he did,
and said mobster is dead or missing,

23:52.364 --> 23:54.365
then perhaps detective
McBride has heard about it.

23:54.399 --> 23:56.066
Meantime,
I'll run D.N.A. to see if this blood

23:56.101 --> 23:57.534
matches anyone in the system.

23:57.568 --> 23:58.935
Thanks, Lanie.

24:03.241 --> 24:06.243
Hey, hey. Hey. So what's the game plan

24:06.277 --> 24:07.844
to survive dinner with your parents?

24:07.879 --> 24:09.880
I don't know.
We barely survived five minutes with them.

24:09.914 --> 24:10.847
You... [sighs]

24:10.882 --> 24:13.316
What if they ask us where we want to live?

24:13.350 --> 24:15.886
When we want kids? [Stammering]

24:15.920 --> 24:17.220
They're gonna see right through us.

24:17.254 --> 24:18.688
Maybe we should come clean.

24:18.723 --> 24:19.823
Javi, I can't come clean.

24:19.857 --> 24:23.059
If I come clean,
I will never hear the end of this.

24:23.093 --> 24:25.661
Look, you met them. You kept your promise.

24:25.695 --> 24:27.096
You can skip dinner.

24:27.131 --> 24:30.066
I'll say something came up...
like a dead body.

24:30.100 --> 24:31.767
No way.

24:31.801 --> 24:34.037
I can't be the kind of fiance that bails

24:34.071 --> 24:36.272
on the one time your parents were in town.

24:36.306 --> 24:39.042
I have to go. We're engaged.

24:39.076 --> 24:40.676
We're not engaged.

24:40.710 --> 24:42.210
[Lowered voice] But we could be.

24:42.245 --> 24:43.612
[Normal voice]Someday.

24:43.647 --> 24:45.548
And I don't want them to hate me then

24:45.582 --> 24:48.017
because I skipped out now.

24:51.087 --> 24:53.221
So I asked around about
the other crime families,

24:53.256 --> 24:55.024
looked into who might have gone missing

24:55.058 --> 24:57.026
or, you know,
taken a bullet the last few days.

24:57.060 --> 24:59.861
I think I got your guy. 6'1", 190 pounds.

24:59.895 --> 25:00.935
He'd fit in those clothes.

25:00.963 --> 25:02.130
Luca Tessaro?

25:02.165 --> 25:04.399
Of the Tessaro crime family?

25:04.434 --> 25:05.967
Yeah, and the family's beating the drums

25:06.001 --> 25:08.370
because Luca disappeared three days ago.

25:08.404 --> 25:10.072
Aren't the Tessaros and
the Carluccis rivals?

25:10.106 --> 25:11.940
More like sworn enemies.

25:11.974 --> 25:14.209
Which could be why things
went bad for your doctor.

25:14.243 --> 25:16.711
You don't cross family lines.

25:16.745 --> 25:18.780
What do we know about Luca's disappearance?

25:18.814 --> 25:21.148
Well, 3 nights ago, 9-1-1 got reports

25:21.183 --> 25:22.584
of shots fired near his neighborhood.

25:22.618 --> 25:25.086
Officers responded.
They didn't find anything.

25:25.120 --> 25:26.754
But Luca hasn't been seen since.

25:26.789 --> 25:28.923
- Thank you, detective.
- Whatever you need.

25:31.293 --> 25:33.427
Why would Eric treat Luca Tessaro,

25:33.462 --> 25:35.062
a member of a rival family?

25:35.097 --> 25:36.964
See,
this is the beauty of me being mobbed up.

25:36.998 --> 25:39.467
Temporarily. I can go straight
to the source and ask Dino.

25:39.501 --> 25:41.668
Castle, just be careful.

25:41.703 --> 25:43.437
If Eric treated a Carlucci enemy,

25:43.472 --> 25:45.072
then Dino had motive.

25:45.107 --> 25:46.807
Dino is not gonna ask me to investigate

25:46.841 --> 25:48.675
if it's gonna lead back to his doorstep.

25:48.710 --> 25:51.078
But I shall return with answers.

25:51.112 --> 25:53.013
The boys and I will check the area

25:53.047 --> 25:54.615
where those shots were fired.

25:54.649 --> 25:57.150
Maybe officers missed something.

25:57.184 --> 25:59.653
Well, if unis missed something,
I'm not finding it.

25:59.687 --> 26:02.856
All five 9-1-1 callers
said they heard shots

26:02.890 --> 26:04.157
near this underpass,

26:04.191 --> 26:06.926
so if Luca Tessaro was killed here,

26:06.960 --> 26:08.761
there's got to be evidence.

26:08.795 --> 26:10.497
Assuming he's really our victim.

26:10.531 --> 26:12.798
Oh, he definitely is. Lanie just texted.

26:12.833 --> 26:15.153
Luca Tessaro's in the system,
and the prelim D.N.A. markers

26:15.169 --> 26:17.103
from the bloody clothes are a match.

26:17.138 --> 26:19.672
How did Luca and Eric cross
paths in the first place?

26:19.706 --> 26:21.473
Yeah.

26:25.746 --> 26:27.446
You guys?

26:30.817 --> 26:32.484
I found a slug.

26:32.519 --> 26:34.020
Call C.S.U.

26:36.723 --> 26:39.791
Hey. I found something else.

26:39.825 --> 26:41.160
Check this out.

26:43.763 --> 26:45.531
That's blood.

26:45.565 --> 26:47.199
Rocco, you must be privy

26:47.233 --> 26:49.067
to the inner workings of the family.

26:49.101 --> 26:50.769
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?

26:53.206 --> 26:56.374
I'm gonna go ahead and take that as a...
as a "yes."

26:56.408 --> 26:59.844
So, first of all,
how well did you know Eric Mercer?

26:59.879 --> 27:02.213
[Sniffs]

27:04.249 --> 27:06.584
You're a man of few words, Rocco.

27:06.618 --> 27:09.554
Very, very few words.

27:09.588 --> 27:11.322
How about Luca Tessaro?

27:11.356 --> 27:14.525
Eric have any history with him?

27:14.560 --> 27:18.229
Luca's a sore subject.

27:18.263 --> 27:22.066
Uh, sore subject, why?
Because he's a Tessaro?

27:22.100 --> 27:24.168
Because he's a stain upon his family.

27:25.370 --> 27:27.204
Okay, I take it Eric didn't like him.

27:27.238 --> 27:30.107
Eric hated Luca. We all do.

27:30.141 --> 27:32.609
For what he did to Jane.

27:32.643 --> 27:34.912
Dino's daughter? How is she involved?

27:36.614 --> 27:38.248
[Sighs]

27:38.282 --> 27:40.784
One night she's at this club.

27:40.819 --> 27:44.854
Luca was there,
and he tried to have his way with her.

27:44.888 --> 27:46.723
Word got back to Dino.

27:46.757 --> 27:48.258
He was ready to kill Luca.

27:48.292 --> 27:50.227
Wanted to pull the trigger himself.

27:50.261 --> 27:53.530
- Well, did he?
- Mnh-mnh. Jane stopped him.

27:53.564 --> 27:56.266
She didn't want a war between families.

27:56.300 --> 27:58.868
Besides,
she's a woman who can take care of herself.

28:00.437 --> 28:03.940
Hey, Beckett,
I just got some very interesting news.

28:03.974 --> 28:05.141
Yeah, so did I.

28:05.175 --> 28:08.243
We found blood evidence at
the scene where Luca was shot.

28:08.277 --> 28:09.811
Go on.

28:09.846 --> 28:12.247
It was Luca's blood on a bracelet.

28:12.281 --> 28:13.982
C.S.U. pulled a thumbprint off of it

28:14.016 --> 28:15.617
that matched a DMV record

28:15.651 --> 28:17.252
for Jane Scarpella.

28:17.286 --> 28:19.054
She's Dino's daughter.

28:19.088 --> 28:21.623
Look, it's possible that Jane killed Luca.

28:21.657 --> 28:23.991
She got Eric to help cover it
up and then she killed him, too.

28:24.025 --> 28:26.160
I just...
I don't know what her motive would be.

28:26.194 --> 28:27.662
I think I do.

28:27.696 --> 28:29.597
Good. Then let's hear it.

28:29.632 --> 28:33.268
Can't. I gotta go.
I'll call you back and tell you later.

28:33.302 --> 28:35.136
[Under breath]I hope. [Cell phone beeps]

28:35.170 --> 28:37.438
The boss will see you now.

28:43.011 --> 28:44.411
Dino.

28:44.445 --> 28:47.347
What news do you have for me, Rick?

28:47.382 --> 28:49.316
Who killed Eric?

28:54.158 --> 28:56.177
You come in here...

28:56.194 --> 28:58.762
to my house of business

28:58.796 --> 29:01.808
and accuse my daughter of not one

29:01.828 --> 29:03.484
but two murders?

29:03.504 --> 29:07.317
Not... accuse as much as...

29:07.337 --> 29:09.638
perhaps she's a... person of interest.

29:09.673 --> 29:12.455
You think I don't know what that means?

29:13.843 --> 29:16.225
You disappoint me, Rick.

29:16.245 --> 29:18.213
I came to you.

29:18.247 --> 29:20.181
I put my faith in you.

29:20.216 --> 29:22.950
[Drawer handle jiggles]
I thought we had an understanding.

29:22.985 --> 29:24.719
We did.

29:24.753 --> 29:27.622
We do. Look, you're the last... whoa!
Whoa! [Click]

29:27.656 --> 29:28.762
Dino, what are you... what are you doing?

29:28.782 --> 29:31.458
I don't tolerate lies, Rick.
[Bullets clatter]

29:31.493 --> 29:34.067
Dino... eh... hey...

29:34.087 --> 29:35.897
Hey, we're family, remember?

29:35.931 --> 29:37.899
[Clicks]That's right.

29:37.933 --> 29:38.866
[Closes drawer]

29:38.901 --> 29:41.171
You never disrespect family.

29:41.191 --> 29:42.800
Who disrespects you?

29:42.820 --> 29:45.039
I respect you, Dino.

29:45.073 --> 29:47.674
I-I-I respect the hell out of you.

29:47.708 --> 29:49.843
[Door opens] Dad, I heard Mr. Castle

29:49.877 --> 29:51.197
had information on Eric's killer.

29:51.212 --> 29:53.364
Oh. What's going on? [Door closes]

29:53.384 --> 29:56.216
Step out, Jane. I'm conducting business.

29:56.251 --> 30:00.120
Dino, ask her. Ask her.
You at least owe me that much.

30:00.155 --> 30:01.889
If she's guilty, you need to know.

30:01.924 --> 30:03.257
Otherwise, you can't protect her.

30:03.291 --> 30:05.559
Guilty? Guilty of what?

30:05.593 --> 30:07.161
Of Tessaro's murder.

30:07.195 --> 30:09.229
Police found your bracelet
where he was shot.

30:09.264 --> 30:11.065
Jane, you tell him.

30:11.099 --> 30:12.232
[Exhales]

30:12.267 --> 30:13.633
Tell him you weren't there, Jane.

30:13.668 --> 30:15.235
You better tell him. [Hammer clicks]

30:15.270 --> 30:17.004
Tell him! Jane, tell him!

30:17.038 --> 30:19.940
Daddy, I'm sorry! I was.

30:21.140 --> 30:23.276
But I didn't kill him.

30:24.150 --> 30:25.946
I was trying to save him.

30:25.980 --> 30:27.481
Save him?

30:27.515 --> 30:30.684
Dad, Luca and I...

30:30.718 --> 30:32.953
we were in love.

30:32.987 --> 30:35.922
[Breathes unevenly] You were in what?

30:35.957 --> 30:37.290
After what he did to you?

30:37.324 --> 30:38.691
That story about him coming on to me...

30:38.725 --> 30:40.126
I made it up.

30:40.160 --> 30:41.995
Made it up?
What do you mean, you made it up?

30:42.029 --> 30:43.997
What was I supposed to say?

30:44.031 --> 30:45.931
That I was in love with a Tessaro?

30:45.966 --> 30:47.700
If either family knew our secret,

30:47.734 --> 30:49.969
we could never be together.

30:52.172 --> 30:54.139
Daddy...

30:54.173 --> 30:56.575
I'm processing this news.

31:00.899 --> 31:02.943
Jane, uh...
[Gasps]

31:02.963 --> 31:04.950
What happened that night?

31:07.153 --> 31:09.321
Luca called me...

31:09.355 --> 31:12.790
Gasping for breath. He'd been shot.

31:12.825 --> 31:15.793
By the time I got to him,
he was unconscious,

31:15.828 --> 31:17.795
dying.

31:17.830 --> 31:20.032
He needed help,
so I dragged him into my car.

31:20.066 --> 31:23.235
That's probably how I lost my bracelet.

31:23.269 --> 31:24.836
So you called Eric.

31:24.870 --> 31:26.905
I didn't know what else to do.

31:26.939 --> 31:29.841
Eric told me to meet
him at the surgery room.

31:29.875 --> 31:32.243
He did everything in
his power to save Luca,

31:32.277 --> 31:34.245
but... he couldn't.

31:34.279 --> 31:36.313
Which explains Eric's murder.

31:36.348 --> 31:39.017
If the Tessaros found out Eric was involved

31:39.051 --> 31:43.087
in Luca's death,
they would have retaliated.

31:43.121 --> 31:44.488
What did they know, Jane?

31:44.523 --> 31:49.226
Nothing.
Eric got rid of the body and the clothes

31:49.261 --> 31:51.895
so nothing could lead them to our family.

31:51.930 --> 31:53.931
Jane, did Luca tell you on the phone

31:53.965 --> 31:55.399
who shot him, who wanted him dead?

31:55.434 --> 31:58.936
No. But last week

31:58.970 --> 32:01.404
he said something was up with the Tessaros.

32:01.439 --> 32:03.540
Somebody was making a power grab,

32:03.575 --> 32:05.341
and he was trying to find out who.

32:05.376 --> 32:07.744
I swear...

32:07.779 --> 32:10.513
if the Tessaros killed my Eric,

32:10.548 --> 32:12.382
we're going to war.

32:15.786 --> 32:17.720
Lovers from rival families.

32:17.754 --> 32:20.256
Wow, that sounds like "Romeo and Juliet."

32:20.291 --> 32:22.425
Right down to Eric as the apothecary.

32:22.460 --> 32:25.195
Yo. Jane's alibi checks out.

32:25.229 --> 32:26.929
Doorman places her at
home during Eric's murder.

32:26.964 --> 32:28.298
What about the street cams in the area

32:28.332 --> 32:30.233
- around Luca Tessaro's shooting?
- We looked.

32:30.267 --> 32:31.734
There's no cameras out that way.

32:31.768 --> 32:33.268
[Huffs]Which means we're dead in the water.

32:33.303 --> 32:34.943
Which means I could be dead in the water.

32:34.972 --> 32:36.606
If one of the Tessaros
killed Luca and Eric,

32:36.640 --> 32:38.240
we need to figure out who it was.

32:38.274 --> 32:39.374
Well,
unless you got a bud in that family, too,

32:39.409 --> 32:40.910
they're not gonna talk.

32:40.944 --> 32:43.079
Luckily,
a credit card just did the talking.

32:43.113 --> 32:45.615
Do you remember those hot
numbers that Eric got from Rita?

32:45.649 --> 32:47.249
Well, someone just used one of 'em

32:47.283 --> 32:49.451
- to order a pizza for delivery.
- It's the killer.

32:49.486 --> 32:50.919
He must have got the cards off Eric's body.

32:50.953 --> 32:52.988
- Delivery to where?
- To a tile import business

32:53.022 --> 32:55.757
owned by Luca's cousin, Dante Tessaro.

32:55.791 --> 32:57.726
And with Luca out of the way, Dante becomes

32:57.760 --> 32:59.628
heir apparent to the Tessaro family.

32:59.662 --> 33:01.796
This tile business... what's the address?

33:04.367 --> 33:05.934
This is it.

33:15.811 --> 33:17.278
[Shotgun pumps]

33:17.312 --> 33:19.748
One more step and I'll blow your heads off.

33:19.782 --> 33:22.483
Luca Tessaro?

33:23.818 --> 33:25.453
You're alive?

33:27.135 --> 33:28.642
Luca, put your weapon down!

33:28.662 --> 33:31.698
Why? So you can take me out?
Finish the job?

33:31.718 --> 33:34.554
- Who sent you?
- Nobody sent us, Mr. Tessaro.

33:34.574 --> 33:36.109
We're not here to kill you.

33:36.143 --> 33:37.277
No, a-as a matter of fact,

33:37.311 --> 33:39.179
we thought you were already dead.

33:39.213 --> 33:41.047
Hey, look, if you don't believe us,

33:41.081 --> 33:43.683
you can always ask Jane!

33:43.717 --> 33:45.551
Isn't that right, Jane?

33:45.585 --> 33:49.301
Wait. It's okay, Luca. They can help.

33:58.331 --> 34:01.166
We knew our families would
never approve of what we had.

34:01.201 --> 34:02.901
So we were gonna use the opportunity

34:02.936 --> 34:05.503
to leave the life... for good.

34:05.538 --> 34:07.806
Disappear.

34:07.841 --> 34:10.242
Those credit cards that Eric got...

34:10.275 --> 34:11.976
they were to help you get away?

34:12.011 --> 34:14.179
[Exhales] But when Eric got popped,

34:14.214 --> 34:16.246
I figured it was the same guy who shot me.

34:16.281 --> 34:19.083
You know, maybe he found out I was alive

34:19.117 --> 34:20.885
and went after Eric to get to me.

34:20.918 --> 34:22.554
Who was trying to kill you, Luca?

34:22.588 --> 34:24.255
I didn't see him.

34:24.289 --> 34:26.757
No one ever has, but...

34:26.792 --> 34:29.159
He calls himself Il Penumbra.

34:30.128 --> 34:32.163
Well, what do you know about him?

34:32.197 --> 34:35.099
He's a new player who
showed up a few months ago.

34:35.132 --> 34:37.168
He started hitting up
store owners on our turf

34:37.202 --> 34:38.869
for protection payments.

34:38.889 --> 34:42.012
Well,
then the store owners must know who he is.

34:42.032 --> 34:45.109
He was reaching out to them anonymously...
Through e-mail.

34:45.143 --> 34:48.612
Wire the payment or face consequences.

34:48.646 --> 34:51.081
One of our dry cleaners refused to pay,

34:51.114 --> 34:53.116
his store burned down to the ground.

34:53.150 --> 34:55.185
Mafia 2.0.

34:55.219 --> 34:58.255
Whoever this guy is,
he was moving into our territory,

34:58.289 --> 35:00.257
and the family ordered
me to track him down.

35:00.291 --> 35:01.324
I uncovered the account

35:01.359 --> 35:03.126
where the shopkeepers
were wiring him the money.

35:03.160 --> 35:05.028
Next thing I know,
I get a call from some guy

35:05.062 --> 35:05.962
saying he could help.

35:05.997 --> 35:07.697
He tells you to meet him under the bridge,

35:07.731 --> 35:10.018
but it's a setup.

35:11.668 --> 35:14.070
The shopkeepers we talked
to confirmed Luca's story.

35:14.105 --> 35:17.240
This Il Penumbra's been
terrorizing them for months.

35:17.275 --> 35:19.075
How do you track someone who nobody's seen?

35:19.110 --> 35:21.911
Not through that bank
info that Luca uncovered.

35:21.945 --> 35:24.113
It dead-ended at a private
account in the Cayman Islands.

35:24.147 --> 35:25.180
And given international banking laws,

35:25.215 --> 35:27.175
there's no way to determine
who owns that account.

35:27.183 --> 35:28.418
But maybe there is.

35:28.452 --> 35:30.887
I, uh, made a new friend who might help us

35:30.921 --> 35:34.056
skirt those pesky
international banking laws.

35:34.090 --> 35:36.426
Now, Rita, I know this is a big ask,

35:36.460 --> 35:38.260
but if we can figure out
who owns that account,

35:38.295 --> 35:39.428
we'll find Eric's real killer.

35:39.462 --> 35:42.231
Now is this Penumbra character
the same guy that framed Christopher?

35:42.265 --> 35:43.465
We believe so, yes.

35:43.499 --> 35:46.068
All right, fine, I'll help.

35:46.102 --> 35:49.238
But only 'cause I don't want
to sleep alone on Christmas.

35:49.272 --> 35:51.307
You and Christopher?

35:52.342 --> 35:54.242
[Inhales sharply] [Typing]

35:54.276 --> 35:57.412
Okay, and... [Beeps]

35:58.981 --> 36:00.482
[Hits desk] You gotta be kidding me.

36:00.516 --> 36:01.950
It's not even a clever alias.

36:01.984 --> 36:05.420
You know,
this guy might be using that alias

36:05.455 --> 36:07.155
to withdraw his cash,

36:07.189 --> 36:09.357
but I bet he created the account remotely.

36:09.391 --> 36:10.624
You think you can trace the account

36:10.659 --> 36:12.427
back to the computer it originated from?

36:12.461 --> 36:13.962
I think you should tell Christopher

36:13.996 --> 36:16.164
he's sleeping over new year's eve, too.

36:18.913 --> 36:21.502
Rita determined Il Penumbra's
Cayman account

36:21.536 --> 36:25.106
was opened using a server at
the midtown library branch.

36:25.140 --> 36:26.807
Public terminal. Makes sense.

36:26.842 --> 36:29.142
Especially since most libraries
don't have security cameras.

36:29.177 --> 36:31.657
But the convenience store across
the street from this one does,

36:31.680 --> 36:33.313
so we pulled the video
feed from the same day

36:33.348 --> 36:34.949
that Il Penumbra created the account.

36:34.983 --> 36:37.785
It's time-stamped, so... [Types]

36:38.753 --> 36:40.020
There.

36:40.054 --> 36:41.789
That's the only person who leaves

36:41.823 --> 36:43.857
in the minutes after
the account was opened.

36:43.891 --> 36:47.361
Well, hello, bad Santa.

36:47.395 --> 36:49.396
Thanks for coming to see us, detective.

36:49.430 --> 36:51.031
Of course.

36:51.065 --> 36:53.000
Our investigation uncovered something

36:53.034 --> 36:55.035
that we hope the organized crime unit

36:55.069 --> 36:56.569
might have information about.

36:56.604 --> 36:58.005
Uh, what'd you find?

36:58.039 --> 37:00.907
Luca Tessaro... alive.

37:00.941 --> 37:03.142
Uh,
from the clothes that you told me about,

37:03.176 --> 37:05.578
- I assumed that he was dead.
- He almost was.

37:05.613 --> 37:07.547
We believe the person that shot Luca

37:07.581 --> 37:09.816
also killed Eric Mercer
to cover their tracks,

37:09.850 --> 37:12.719
which means the shooter knew
that the two of them were in contact.

37:12.753 --> 37:15.421
The shooter goes by the name of
"Il Penumbra."

37:15.455 --> 37:17.356
- Does that ring a bell?
- Can't say it does.

37:17.391 --> 37:19.691
Huh. Okay, well, this, uh, Il Penumbra...

37:19.726 --> 37:22.228
he planted evidence to
frame Christopher Carlucci

37:22.262 --> 37:24.863
of Eric's murder after using
a Mustang like Christopher's

37:24.898 --> 37:26.432
to commit the crime.

37:26.466 --> 37:28.501
I'm not sure where you're going with this.

37:28.535 --> 37:30.269
Your neighbor owns a black Mustang.

37:30.303 --> 37:31.770
He said that you slipped him a little cash

37:31.804 --> 37:33.238
to borrow it for that night.

37:33.272 --> 37:34.706
Ryan: We had C.S.U. sweep the car.

37:34.741 --> 37:36.341
They found traces of Eric's blood

37:36.375 --> 37:38.410
on the floor mat left there by your boot.

37:38.444 --> 37:40.345
Are you accusing me of murder?

37:40.379 --> 37:42.514
Along with the attempted
murder of Luca Tessaro

37:42.549 --> 37:44.215
and felony extortion.

37:44.250 --> 37:46.284
We found the account in the Caymans.

37:46.318 --> 37:48.386
You've been working O.C.U. for 16 years

37:48.421 --> 37:50.221
watching bad guys get rich.

37:50.256 --> 37:51.956
So you decided to play both sides,

37:51.990 --> 37:53.758
get a little piece of the action.

37:53.792 --> 37:55.927
This will never fly in court.

37:55.961 --> 37:57.728
Yeah, well,
there's only one way to find out.

37:57.763 --> 37:59.330
[Handcuffs clack]

38:02.334 --> 38:06.170
["Oh Tannenbaum" playing]

38:07.338 --> 38:09.239
Rick.

38:10.475 --> 38:12.242
Hey!

38:12.277 --> 38:13.410
[Chuckles]

38:16.514 --> 38:17.815
Mr. Castle...

38:17.849 --> 38:19.650
I'm very grateful.

38:19.685 --> 38:21.285
And so is Rita.

38:21.319 --> 38:23.287
And my daughter Jane...
she thanks you, too.

38:23.321 --> 38:25.322
What's gonna happen to her and Luca?

38:25.356 --> 38:28.459
I decided it's better to
bless her relationship

38:28.493 --> 38:31.628
and unite with the Tessaros
than to lose my kid.

38:31.662 --> 38:33.630
[Chuckles]'Tis the season of peace, no?

38:33.664 --> 38:35.299
- Yeah.
- Rick...

38:35.333 --> 38:37.901
You did me a favor.

38:37.935 --> 38:39.402
I owe you.

38:39.436 --> 38:40.336
Uh...

38:40.370 --> 38:43.439
When the time comes...

38:43.474 --> 38:45.642
you call me.

38:46.844 --> 38:48.812
Thank you very much. [Clears throat]

38:48.846 --> 38:51.114
That's a call I hope I never have to make.

38:54.384 --> 38:56.486
[Kisses twice]

38:58.388 --> 39:00.723
Merry Christmas.

39:02.859 --> 39:04.360
Dinner was so great.

39:04.394 --> 39:07.296
We can't wait to see
you two lovebirds again.

39:07.331 --> 39:09.365
Maybe next time we can
talk about the wedding.

39:09.399 --> 39:11.967
Maybe. One step at a time, mom.

39:12.002 --> 39:14.169
Well,
it was great to finally meet you both.

39:14.203 --> 39:14.937
Okay.

39:14.971 --> 39:17.006
- All right, pumpkin.
- Bye, mommy.

39:17.040 --> 39:18.306
- Love you.
- Mm.

39:18.341 --> 39:19.141
- You be good.
- I will.

39:19.175 --> 39:22.444
All right. You guys have a good trip.

39:22.478 --> 39:25.147
Thank you for that.

39:25.181 --> 39:27.049
Well, it was actually much easier

39:27.083 --> 39:29.317
than I thought it was gonna be. [Chuckles]

39:29.352 --> 39:30.519
But, you know,

39:30.553 --> 39:33.988
it made me think seriously about us

39:34.023 --> 39:35.357
and where we are.

39:37.226 --> 39:39.994
Javi,
I-I don't think we should do this here.

39:40.029 --> 39:42.497
No, I have to say this.

39:42.532 --> 39:44.466
Lanie...

39:44.500 --> 39:47.535
being fake engaged to you

39:47.569 --> 39:50.529
made me realize how great we are together.

39:51.740 --> 39:53.908
But not the way that your parents are.

39:53.942 --> 39:56.377
[Exhales] Or Castle and Beckett

39:56.411 --> 39:57.912
- or Ryan and Jenny.
- I know.

39:57.946 --> 39:59.714
I-I feel it, too. I...

39:59.748 --> 40:01.415
I mean, I'm crazy about you.

40:01.449 --> 40:04.418
Oh, I'm crazy about you, too,
but just, you know, not...

40:04.452 --> 40:07.087
not in that way.

40:07.121 --> 40:09.223
And you deserve what they have.

40:09.257 --> 40:10.991
We both do.

40:12.360 --> 40:13.860
[Kisses]

40:13.895 --> 40:15.262
[Laughs]

40:15.297 --> 40:16.930
What are you gonna tell your parents?

40:16.964 --> 40:19.399
The truth. But after the holidays.

40:19.433 --> 40:21.668
- No need to spoil their vacation.
- Mmhmm.

40:21.703 --> 40:22.836
[Clicks tongue] Hey!

40:22.870 --> 40:24.571
[Laughs]

40:24.605 --> 40:27.549
So then he cut you with a
little ceremonial dagger. Did it hurt?

40:27.569 --> 40:29.576
Yeah, it hurt,
but you can't let him know that, right?

40:29.610 --> 40:31.945
- So my face was like a stone.
- The black hand.

40:31.979 --> 40:33.379
- Right.
- Right.

40:33.414 --> 40:34.447
Can I have a word, Mr. Castle?

40:34.481 --> 40:35.682
Yeah, of course. Here.

40:35.716 --> 40:36.916
Tell me the rest later.

40:36.950 --> 40:38.913
Who wants nog?

40:39.332 --> 40:41.421
Is there a problem, captain?

40:41.455 --> 40:43.856
As he was being transferred
to central booking,

40:43.890 --> 40:45.891
Detective McBride was shot and killed

40:45.926 --> 40:47.760
by unknown assailants.

40:47.794 --> 40:50.129
The D.A. learned that you were cooperating

40:50.163 --> 40:53.398
with members of organized
crime in your investigation,

40:53.433 --> 40:55.467
people who might have wanted McBride dead.

40:55.501 --> 40:58.570
Uh... This doesn't look good,

40:58.605 --> 41:00.039
especially for you.

41:00.073 --> 41:03.075
I am so sorry, Mr. Castle,

41:03.110 --> 41:07.213
but the D.A. spoke to the mayor, and...

41:07.247 --> 41:09.281
[Sighs]

41:09.315 --> 41:13.218
You are no longer permitted
to work with the N.Y.P.D.

41:19.459 --> 41:21.151
Castle.

41:21.827 --> 41:23.128
Hey.

41:23.162 --> 41:24.595
Okay, so, I, um...

41:24.630 --> 41:26.397
I've got my draft

41:26.431 --> 41:28.967
of the poem for the family Christmas card.

41:29.001 --> 41:30.001
Want to hear it?

41:30.002 --> 41:31.269
- Yeah.
- Okay.

41:31.303 --> 41:32.804
[Clears throat]

41:32.838 --> 41:35.439
"This has been an epic year.

41:35.474 --> 41:37.976
"Life's been full of joy and tears.

41:38.010 --> 41:40.245
"Solving crimes and catching killers,

41:40.279 --> 41:43.013
"just like Castle's famous thrillers.

41:43.047 --> 41:45.349
"We share a passion every day.

41:45.384 --> 41:48.985
As partners go, we're here to stay."

41:49.019 --> 41:51.087
It's great.

41:51.121 --> 41:52.622
Thank you. [Paper rustles]

41:52.657 --> 41:54.324
Something wrong?

41:54.358 --> 41:55.692
What could be wrong? You're here.

41:55.726 --> 41:57.093
Oh!

41:57.127 --> 41:58.127
[Kiss]

41:59.363 --> 42:00.930
All right, everybody,

42:00.964 --> 42:02.999
let's light this baby up! [Switch clicks]

42:03.033 --> 42:04.667
[Electricity crackles] [Cheering]

42:04.701 --> 42:06.335
Ryan: Merry Christmas!

42:06.369 --> 42:07.870
Looks great this year!
