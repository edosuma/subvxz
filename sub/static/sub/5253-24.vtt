WEBVTT

00:02.172 --> 00:03.515
Where is she? Is she okay?

00:03.540 --> 00:05.085
Let's just prepare for the
worst and hope for the best.

00:05.110 --> 00:06.676
Sadie's strong. I know she'll be okay.

00:06.678 --> 00:07.877
Is that thing glued to your lips?

00:07.879 --> 00:09.912
Why won't anyone tell us how she is?

00:11.516 --> 00:13.282
You should all just come with me.

00:17.222 --> 00:18.488
Oh, God.

00:18.490 --> 00:20.623
Can... can she speak?

00:20.625 --> 00:22.859
Will you drama queens
shut the [bleep] up?

00:22.861 --> 00:24.394
Oh, my God, it's a miracle!

00:24.396 --> 00:26.179
Praise Jesus!

00:26.204 --> 00:29.109
I told you no visitors, Nurse Ratchet.

00:29.134 --> 00:32.634
How is anyone supposed to
get any rest in this hellhole?

00:32.637 --> 00:34.203
Thank you so much for coming,

00:34.205 --> 00:36.673
but you're not friends
or family, so get out!

00:36.675 --> 00:38.341
Yeah, you heard the crash test dummy.

00:38.343 --> 00:40.410
That goes for you too, limp liver.

00:40.412 --> 00:43.079
And why would you bring Hamilstaph here?

00:43.081 --> 00:46.482
She's covered in more bacteria
than the floor of this hospital!

00:46.484 --> 00:49.819
Well, at least she can speak.

00:49.821 --> 00:52.921

00:53.391 --> 00:56.325
Nurse, please remove these intruders.

00:56.327 --> 00:57.796
I need my rest.

00:58.963 --> 01:01.497
You guys, I've never seen her like this.

01:01.499 --> 01:04.434
Okay, I have, like, every
day, but this feels worse.

01:04.436 --> 01:06.469
That text she sent? Jesus.

01:06.471 --> 01:07.737
How did it happen?

01:07.739 --> 01:09.305
You ask me, it was a cry for help.

01:09.307 --> 01:11.207
When you are that nasty and miserable

01:11.209 --> 01:13.643
and have no friends left,
what else is there to do

01:13.645 --> 01:15.203
besides drive in front of a truck?

01:16.343 --> 01:18.448
How could you try to take your own life?

01:18.450 --> 01:20.249
What are you talking about, you moron?

01:20.251 --> 01:22.819
No matter what fights we had,
it didn't need to come to this.

01:22.821 --> 01:24.921
You can't all be serious.

01:24.923 --> 01:28.291
You think I tried to
kill myself over you?

01:28.293 --> 01:30.059
You drove in front of a truck!

01:30.061 --> 01:31.694
I clipped its mirror

01:31.696 --> 01:34.230
and overcorrected into a street sign.

01:34.232 --> 01:35.598
Sadie, is there anything we can do?

01:35.600 --> 01:38.045
- Get out.
- Okay, well, wish you could

01:38.070 --> 01:39.335
be with us at Camp Pookah tomorrow.

01:39.337 --> 01:42.505
Why would I want to step foot
in that tick-infested firetrap?

01:42.507 --> 01:44.140
They're closing, Sadie. Forever.

01:44.142 --> 01:45.641
Finally, some good news.

01:45.643 --> 01:46.876
The sooner they bulldoze

01:46.878 --> 01:49.023
that sad, horse[bleep]-smelling...

01:50.381 --> 01:51.948
Wait. What's happening to the horses?

01:51.950 --> 01:53.616
Well, I think they're
getting moved to another camp

01:53.618 --> 01:54.718
in San Bernardino.

01:54.743 --> 01:56.496
Oh, God, Chocolate Chip.

01:56.521 --> 01:58.387
There she goes again
trying to eat her feelings.

01:58.389 --> 02:00.556
He was my horse, you pickled booze bag.

02:00.558 --> 02:01.991
Get the [bleep] out!

02:05.497 --> 02:08.464
And you, stop looking at me!

02:11.202 --> 02:12.702
It's official. I got in.

02:12.704 --> 02:14.971
You are looking at an SCU sophomore.

02:14.973 --> 02:16.105
But you loved Wyckoff.

02:16.107 --> 02:17.740
Yeah, but SCU is big

02:17.742 --> 02:20.309
and has such a better writing program,

02:20.311 --> 02:21.611
and Luke's around.

02:21.613 --> 02:23.179
Way to downplay the main attraction.

02:23.181 --> 02:26.187
Not the main attraction,
just a hot added bonus.

02:26.212 --> 02:27.950
I feel you on that.

02:27.952 --> 02:29.452
It is a warm and fuzzy jam

02:29.454 --> 02:31.154
to have a supportive and helpful BF.

02:31.156 --> 02:32.855
Yeah, Patrick is pretty great.

02:32.857 --> 02:35.453
Cool and cute and generous to boot.

02:35.994 --> 02:39.462
Jenna, he's offered
to pay off all my debt.

02:39.464 --> 02:40.863
So you're gonna let him do it?

02:40.865 --> 02:41.998
Why not?

02:42.000 --> 02:43.633
TBH, on some level,

02:43.635 --> 02:45.535
I kind of like being taken care of.

02:45.537 --> 02:47.370
It's sort of empowering.

02:47.372 --> 02:50.273
Okay, got to run, SCU girl.

02:50.275 --> 02:52.953
I will see you maÃ±ana at Camp Pookah.

02:53.878 --> 02:55.311
SCU girl, huh?

02:55.313 --> 02:56.512
So you're gonna do it?

02:56.514 --> 02:58.514
Yeah, just got my official acceptance.

02:58.516 --> 03:00.349
Congrats, I guess.

03:00.351 --> 03:02.652
I mean, if you think
that's the right, uh, thing.

03:02.654 --> 03:03.653
It is the right thing.

03:03.655 --> 03:04.954
Yeah, it's just, you know,

03:04.956 --> 03:06.789
when I wanted to transfer to Wyckoff

03:06.791 --> 03:08.391
to be with you, you said that...

03:08.393 --> 03:09.559
It's not the same thing, Matty,

03:09.561 --> 03:10.760
not by a long shot.

03:10.762 --> 03:12.061
This has nothing to do with Luke?

03:12.063 --> 03:13.696
No, it doesn't.

03:13.698 --> 03:15.640
- I know what I'm doing, okay?
- Okay.

03:16.501 --> 03:18.301
Am I gonna see you at
Camp Pookah tomorrow?

03:18.303 --> 03:20.236
Yeah, I kind of can't wait

03:20.261 --> 03:22.374
just to see it all one last time...

03:22.375 --> 03:24.664
The dock, my old bunk bed,

03:24.992 --> 03:26.642
freezer in the kitchen.

03:26.644 --> 03:29.312
We used to pick the lock
and steal the ice cream.

03:29.314 --> 03:30.680
- You did that too?
- What?

03:30.682 --> 03:32.548
You thought only the cool
kids stole the ice cream?

03:32.550 --> 03:34.317
Well, you were cool,

03:34.319 --> 03:36.285
to me anyway.

03:36.287 --> 03:37.679
I want to do it again.

03:38.976 --> 03:41.791
Hey, I'll bring a paper
clip and some bobby pins.

03:41.793 --> 03:43.926
You bring a hammer just in case.

03:46.096 --> 03:47.997
Congrats, babe.

03:47.999 --> 03:49.665
Oh, I couldn't have done it without you.

03:49.667 --> 03:51.801
Your talent and hard
work is what got you in,

03:51.803 --> 03:53.870
and it's perfect timing.

03:53.872 --> 03:56.072
Professor Heaney is having
an open house tomorrow.

03:56.074 --> 03:57.843
But my Camp Pookah thing is tomorrow.

03:57.868 --> 03:58.796
I know.

03:58.821 --> 04:01.421
It's just, he's the head of the program.

04:01.446 --> 04:03.079
Almost all the professors will be there,

04:03.081 --> 04:04.814
lots of your future classmates too.

04:04.816 --> 04:07.383
I really wish I could, but
I already promised everyone.

04:07.385 --> 04:08.718
Jenna, this is kind of a big deal.

04:08.720 --> 04:11.187
You might not want to miss
it for, you know, camp.

04:11.189 --> 04:13.789
It's more than just camp to me, Luke.

04:13.791 --> 04:16.225
It's a place full of memories.

04:16.226 --> 04:19.562
I mean, I was a camper
there, then a counselor.

04:19.564 --> 04:22.698
Okay, but you're
coming in as a transfer.

04:22.700 --> 04:24.333
This is such a great way
for you to get a head start,

04:24.335 --> 04:27.687
and I kind of told everybody
you were coming with me.

04:27.712 --> 04:29.078
I know.

04:29.103 --> 04:30.670
I just wanted to show
you off to everybody.

04:30.820 --> 04:33.743
I was flattered he wanted
to bring me so badly,

04:33.745 --> 04:35.244
and he was right.

04:35.246 --> 04:37.380
I'd have my memories of camp forever,

04:37.382 --> 04:39.593
but SCU was my future.

04:39.618 --> 04:41.818
Okay, you got me.

04:41.843 --> 04:42.726
I'm in.

04:42.751 --> 04:43.499
You sure?

04:44.148 --> 04:46.070
Beyond sure.

04:48.629 --> 04:50.878
It was my first big SCU event,

04:50.903 --> 04:55.137
and I was nervous and
excited and distracted.

04:57.376 --> 05:00.010
Jenna, I'd like you to
meet Peter and Kelly.

05:00.012 --> 05:02.212
This is the girlfriend we've
been hearing so much about.

05:02.214 --> 05:03.813
Oh, don't believe all the hype.

05:03.815 --> 05:06.183
I won't. I'm a cynical bastard.

05:06.185 --> 05:07.384
Oh, don't be an ass, Peter.

05:07.386 --> 05:08.518
You'll scare her.

05:08.520 --> 05:09.762
I couldn't expect to just

05:09.787 --> 05:11.886
instantly click with everyone at SCU.

05:11.911 --> 05:14.590
I was starting from scratch
and was going to need

05:14.615 --> 05:16.870
to give it time and
to stop thinking about

05:16.895 --> 05:20.044
my old friends having fun
at Camp Pookah without me.

05:21.937 --> 05:24.237
Hey, where's Jenna?

05:24.262 --> 05:25.528
She had to go some SCU thing.

05:25.560 --> 05:26.301
So, what, she's not coming?

05:26.326 --> 05:27.592
No, which really sucks

05:27.599 --> 05:28.865
because we were supposed to accidentally

05:28.866 --> 05:30.253
fall out of the canoe together.

05:30.278 --> 05:31.911
We were planning an ice cream heist.

05:31.913 --> 05:33.779
Well, there goes your last chance ever.

05:33.781 --> 05:35.281
Greed is taking this place down.

05:35.283 --> 05:37.016
Our childhood is being annihilated

05:37.018 --> 05:38.551
and turned into condos.

05:38.553 --> 05:39.719
Lissa, dark.

05:39.721 --> 05:40.753
Sadie's brush with death

05:40.755 --> 05:42.154
has me in a darkish place.

05:42.156 --> 05:44.356
If she died, I think she might have

05:44.358 --> 05:47.193
gone to hell, and that's just not fun.

05:47.195 --> 05:49.495
We should take a
picture to cheer her up.

05:53.868 --> 05:55.911
I am so sick of forms.

05:56.661 --> 05:57.546
_

05:57.571 --> 05:58.904
What the hell is this?

05:58.906 --> 06:00.172
Precautionary measure,

06:00.174 --> 06:02.241
given the circumstances
of your accident.

06:02.243 --> 06:04.176
I didn't try to kill myself.

06:04.178 --> 06:06.011
The hospital is providing
you with a counselor.

06:06.013 --> 06:08.581
I don't want a freaking counselor.

06:08.583 --> 06:09.882
Ms. Saxton.

06:09.884 --> 06:12.651
What the hell are you doing here?

06:12.653 --> 06:14.286
I'm the grief counselor.

06:14.288 --> 06:16.789
Now listen, no matter how bad it gets,

06:16.791 --> 06:18.457
suicide is never the answer.

06:18.459 --> 06:20.459
You cannot leave me
alone with this idiot!

06:20.461 --> 06:22.928
She causes more suicides
than she prevents!

06:22.930 --> 06:24.597
Shh. It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

06:24.599 --> 06:26.332
Listen to me, dimwit.

06:26.334 --> 06:29.001
I don't know if you got your
grief counseling certificate

06:29.003 --> 06:31.203
from the same 99Â¢ store that you got

06:31.205 --> 06:35.007
your guidance counselor
credentials, and I don't care.

06:35.009 --> 06:37.276
This whole thing is a
big misunderstanding.

06:37.278 --> 06:38.978
The accident wasn't even my fault!

06:38.980 --> 06:40.679
It was that bitch inside my phone!

06:40.681 --> 06:42.548
Do you have a tendency to blame others

06:42.550 --> 06:44.049
for your thoughts of suicide?

06:44.051 --> 06:46.085
That is it. I am out here!

06:46.087 --> 06:47.253
Not alone.

06:47.255 --> 06:48.854
You're not invited where I'm going.

06:48.856 --> 06:53.459
You are not leaving this
room until I discharge you.

06:54.762 --> 06:57.196
Remember, all castles should have

06:57.198 --> 07:00.599
a very high tower just for the princess.

07:00.601 --> 07:02.835
As Virginia Woolf says, "Every princess

07:02.837 --> 07:04.170
needs a room of her own."

07:04.172 --> 07:08.044
Bunny Boots, I have a surprise for you!

07:08.739 --> 07:10.906
Ah, Garrett Gibson!

07:10.908 --> 07:14.176
Oh, my God... our God, your God!

07:14.178 --> 07:16.411
This is almost like
FaceTiming with Jesus!

07:16.413 --> 07:19.214
Well, I do try to keep the
line to the Savior open.

07:19.216 --> 07:21.183
Listen, your mom tells me

07:21.185 --> 07:22.851
what a devoted servant you are.

07:22.853 --> 07:25.620
He's a big fan of Atonercise, baby.

07:25.622 --> 07:26.922
Oh, really?

07:26.924 --> 07:28.490
Yes, it's a wonderful way

07:28.492 --> 07:30.158
to praise the Lord and burn calories

07:30.160 --> 07:31.226
all at the same time.

07:31.228 --> 07:32.594
I know, right?

07:32.596 --> 07:34.363
If Satan's got a hold of your thighs,

07:34.365 --> 07:35.964
grab that cross, Atonercise!

07:35.966 --> 07:37.165
Wonderful!

07:37.167 --> 07:38.734
He wants to buy your business.

07:38.736 --> 07:39.901
What? Really?

07:39.903 --> 07:41.536
Yes, Lissa, you have done

07:41.538 --> 07:44.272
a great job getting Atonercise started,

07:44.274 --> 07:45.941
but now it needs a bigger platform.

07:45.943 --> 07:48.276
My church has an international reach.

07:48.278 --> 07:50.511
If we can bring
Atonercise into the fold,

07:50.536 --> 07:53.248
well, business will boom, fat will burn,

07:53.251 --> 07:54.751
and souls will flourish!

07:54.753 --> 07:56.085
"Bring into the fold"?

07:56.087 --> 07:57.553
My lawyers have drawn up an agreement.

07:57.555 --> 07:59.169
You will be handsomely compensated.

07:59.194 --> 08:01.058
All you have to do is
sign on the dotted line.

08:01.083 --> 08:02.028
Lawyers?

08:02.053 --> 08:05.971
My church corporation will get the
Atonercise name and your routines

08:05.996 --> 08:07.907
but you will certainly be involved.

08:07.932 --> 08:10.600
God has made you the conduit for this

08:10.602 --> 08:13.231
wonderful spiritual exercise regime.

08:13.256 --> 08:14.786
Conduit?

08:15.473 --> 08:17.661
No, it was my idea!

08:17.686 --> 08:18.819
Pray on it, Lissa.

08:18.844 --> 08:20.754
And check out the deal points.

08:20.779 --> 08:23.379
My lawyer? Really fair.

Ay Dios mÃ­o.

08:39.802 --> 08:41.236
Who the [bleep] are you?

08:41.238 --> 08:43.145
Go!

08:43.169 --> 08:43.989
Come on, Kev!

08:44.014 --> 08:45.997
Use your core!

08:46.777 --> 08:48.737
- Ow!
- Ouch.

08:49.536 --> 08:51.199
Jenna was supposed to do this with us.

08:51.224 --> 08:52.991
I guess she's got better things to do.

08:52.993 --> 08:54.092
Guess so.

08:54.094 --> 08:55.160
Do you think she should transfer?

08:55.162 --> 08:56.294
If I have learned one thing

08:56.296 --> 08:57.729
in my 18 years of parenting,

08:57.731 --> 08:59.651
it is to let Jenna make up her own mind.

08:59.676 --> 09:00.899
Even if she's making a mistake?

09:00.901 --> 09:02.901
Because the only reason she's
transferring is to be with Luke.

09:02.903 --> 09:05.904
If you have something to
say to her, just say it.

09:05.906 --> 09:08.740
You're still kids; it's not like
you're married, for God's sake.

09:08.742 --> 09:10.942
This guy, he has to do
exactly what I tell him to do.

09:10.944 --> 09:12.210
What do I have to do?

09:12.212 --> 09:14.979
I was just saying how lucky I am

09:14.981 --> 09:18.183
to be married to the
boy that I have loved

09:18.185 --> 09:20.485
ever since I first laid
eyes on him in high school.

09:20.487 --> 09:21.719
Aww.

09:21.721 --> 09:24.522
Academic discourses become so fragmented

09:24.524 --> 09:27.425
and contentious as to
have become political.

09:27.427 --> 09:28.960
But everything is political.

09:28.962 --> 09:30.328
What do you think, Jenna?

09:30.330 --> 09:32.897
Ah, the smartphone.

09:32.899 --> 09:34.732
The bane of social interaction

09:34.734 --> 09:36.119
in the civilized world.

09:37.037 --> 09:39.254
It's nice to meet you just the same.

09:40.458 --> 09:42.019
Could you maybe try a little harder?

09:42.044 --> 09:42.941
That man is our host.

09:42.943 --> 09:44.878
I was trying, but to be honest,

09:44.903 --> 09:46.077
I was a little bored.

09:46.079 --> 09:48.505
Yeah, I'm sorry we don't
have canoes and rope swings.

09:49.316 --> 09:50.648
Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

09:50.650 --> 09:51.983
No, it's okay.

09:51.985 --> 09:53.017
Look, maybe you should go.

09:53.019 --> 09:54.119
I'm fine.

09:54.121 --> 09:55.120
If you're not enjoying this,

09:55.122 --> 09:56.121
it's better that you not stay

09:56.123 --> 09:57.555
and make a bad impression,

09:57.557 --> 09:59.057
for you, I mean.

09:59.059 --> 10:01.782
Guess I better go... for me.

10:10.536 --> 10:12.937
That ring's really expensive.

10:12.939 --> 10:15.039
Is it for you or a girl?

10:15.041 --> 10:17.075
It's for a girl.

10:18.263 --> 10:20.464
You made it! How was the SCU thing?

10:20.896 --> 10:22.329
It was fun.

10:22.591 --> 10:25.335
You sound lukewarm, pun intended.

10:26.161 --> 10:27.627
No, it was great.

10:27.629 --> 10:29.562
There were all these cool people,

10:29.564 --> 10:31.865
and we had wine and cheese

10:31.867 --> 10:36.069
and... and talked about... stuff.

10:37.939 --> 10:40.506
Taste of things to come, right?

10:43.730 --> 10:46.779
Hey, Derek was cool
and let the dogs out.

10:46.781 --> 10:48.523
- Well, me.
- Derek mellowed out?

10:48.547 --> 10:50.760
Dude's got his whole life
planned until retirement.

10:50.785 --> 10:53.067
I can't stop thinking
about his windowless office

10:53.091 --> 10:54.395
and how scary it can be to commit

10:54.419 --> 10:55.985
to something for a lifetime.

10:55.987 --> 10:58.367
Well, I guess it depends on
what you're committing to.

11:01.158 --> 11:04.928
Sadie Saxton, I am an
empath, but if you give me

11:04.930 --> 11:07.249
one more flat tire, I will tip you over.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.300
- Val?
- J-Town!

11:10.302 --> 11:11.935
Look at you.

11:11.937 --> 11:13.503
Oh, I miss you.

11:13.505 --> 11:14.671
Can you believe it?

11:14.673 --> 11:16.239
I'm rescuing another wounded bird.

11:16.241 --> 11:17.473
Out of my way!

11:17.475 --> 11:18.808
She was admitted into my hospital.

11:18.810 --> 11:20.577
Did I tell you I'm grief counseling now?

11:20.579 --> 11:22.912
- Oh, wow. Huh.
- You know what?

11:22.914 --> 11:25.942
Actually, maybe you should talk
to Sadie since you both tried

11:25.967 --> 11:27.550
to, you know...

11:27.552 --> 11:28.985
Ix-nay yourselves.

11:28.987 --> 11:31.054
Technically, she's
still on suicide watch,

11:31.056 --> 11:35.112
but equine therapy is supposed
to be very good for depressives.

11:35.137 --> 11:37.551
Besides, what can she possibly
find in that barn to hurt herself?

11:37.576 --> 11:38.800
Rope?

11:38.825 --> 11:41.392
Cattle prods, pickaxes.

11:41.394 --> 11:42.627
[bleep]!

11:42.629 --> 11:44.295
Hey!

11:44.297 --> 11:45.669
You made it after all.

11:45.694 --> 11:47.498
Yeah, I had a real taste

11:47.500 --> 11:49.767
for some freezer-burnt Rocky Road.

11:49.769 --> 11:51.235
All right.

11:51.237 --> 11:52.670
I'm sorry I've been away

11:52.672 --> 11:54.071
for so long, Chocko.

11:55.475 --> 11:57.541
I can't believe you're moving.

11:57.543 --> 11:59.343
Me too. I have to go back to New York,

11:59.345 --> 12:00.544
and I wish I could take you with,

12:00.546 --> 12:02.236
but I don't have a place for you,

12:02.261 --> 12:04.768
and there, they make
horses pull carriages

12:04.793 --> 12:07.658
full of disgusting tourists,
and that is no life for you.

12:09.455 --> 12:11.346
Shh, don't interrupt.

12:11.371 --> 12:13.299
This is beast-to-beast catharsis.

12:13.324 --> 12:15.758
But I promise I will make
sure they take good care of you

12:15.760 --> 12:18.636
because you were the best horse ever.

12:19.364 --> 12:20.705
A true friend.

12:21.566 --> 12:24.133
Even if sometimes I might
have taken you for granted,

12:24.135 --> 12:26.167
you were always there for me...

12:27.772 --> 12:29.172
and you never held it against me

12:29.174 --> 12:30.673
if I got a little
bitchy because you knew

12:30.675 --> 12:33.042
how much I loved you,
even if I didn't say it

12:33.044 --> 12:34.462
as much as I should have.

12:35.013 --> 12:36.089
But I did.

12:39.050 --> 12:41.011
And I do.

12:43.688 --> 12:45.087
And I wish my other friends

12:45.089 --> 12:46.989
understood that like you.

12:50.295 --> 12:52.772
I love you, Chocolate Chip.

12:54.065 --> 12:56.232
Your friendship means more to me

12:56.234 --> 12:58.467
than you will ever know.

13:03.675 --> 13:05.675
Okay, you [bleep]heads can come out now!

13:05.677 --> 13:07.343
I know you're watching me.

13:07.345 --> 13:09.145
What are you looking at, you creepers?

13:09.147 --> 13:11.447
I'm just talking to my horse.

13:12.617 --> 13:15.051
And I'm sorry...

13:16.387 --> 13:18.855
For... whatever.

13:18.857 --> 13:21.224
Jesus!

13:23.995 --> 13:27.196
Okay, I am, like,
freakishly good at my job.

13:27.198 --> 13:28.631
I need your advice, Sadie.

13:28.633 --> 13:30.833
Mommy is here with Garrett Gibson.

13:30.835 --> 13:32.476
That revolting mega-preacher?

13:32.508 --> 13:33.941
He wants to buy Atonercise

13:33.943 --> 13:35.576
and fold it into his church

13:35.578 --> 13:37.044
and his corporation,

13:37.046 --> 13:39.413
which I guess are the same thing.

13:39.563 --> 13:41.363
He said I was a conduit.

13:41.365 --> 13:42.798
Do you really want someone like that

13:42.800 --> 13:45.534
running something that you
worked so hard to create?

13:45.536 --> 13:47.002
Man, I'd never do that.

13:47.004 --> 13:48.702
I love being my own boss.

13:48.727 --> 13:50.627
I mean, it's harder
and more responsibility,

13:50.629 --> 13:52.662
but it's yours.

13:54.031 --> 13:56.180
Mommy, I'm not selling Atonercise.

13:56.205 --> 13:58.105
Lissa, don't make hasty decisions.

13:58.130 --> 13:59.413
It's not hasty.

13:59.438 --> 14:01.838
I talked to Sadie and God.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.840
But you said that talking to Garrett

14:03.842 --> 14:05.642
was like FaceTiming with Jesus.

14:05.644 --> 14:07.014
If I can build Atonercise

14:07.039 --> 14:08.945
into a national franchise

14:08.947 --> 14:10.814
and become hugely successful,

14:10.816 --> 14:12.549
I can cut out the middleman

14:12.551 --> 14:14.584
and FaceTime with actual Jesus.

14:14.586 --> 14:16.398
Go, ladyballs.

14:17.656 --> 14:19.622
If Lissa can do it, I can do it.

14:19.624 --> 14:21.191
I need to bet on myself.

14:21.193 --> 14:23.793
If I can't dig myself out
of this debt that I'm in,

14:23.795 --> 14:26.262
then I'll feel like a helpless
loser for the rest of my life.

14:26.264 --> 14:27.597
You're not a loser, T.

14:27.599 --> 14:29.065
Okay, here goes.

14:29.067 --> 14:30.767
We're from two different worlds.

14:30.769 --> 14:31.868
Mine is one where I need to learn

14:31.870 --> 14:33.236
to stand on my own two feet,

14:33.238 --> 14:34.738
which will for sure happen,

14:34.740 --> 14:37.419
but it could literally take years.

14:37.444 --> 14:39.470
So, until then,

14:39.495 --> 14:44.491
can we just sort of put a pin in this?

14:44.516 --> 14:45.815
Am I crazy?

14:45.817 --> 14:48.583
The least crazy girl I've ever met.

14:49.955 --> 14:51.154
There you are.

14:51.156 --> 14:52.956
That back window by the
freezer is still loose,

14:52.958 --> 14:54.991
and I brought a hammer just in case.

14:54.993 --> 14:56.192
Let's do this.

15:15.247 --> 15:16.379
So, Jenna...

15:16.381 --> 15:18.248
Jenna, the deed is done.

15:18.250 --> 15:19.949
WTF is wrong with me?

15:19.951 --> 15:21.584
Nothing is wrong with you.

15:21.586 --> 15:23.987
You made an incredibly mature decision,

15:23.989 --> 15:26.623
and I'm proud of you
for betting on yourself.

15:26.625 --> 15:28.104
Hey, is there any more ice cream?

15:28.129 --> 15:29.464
You have to climb through the window.

15:29.489 --> 15:32.825
That's a lot of work, and I
am over indentured servitude.

15:32.850 --> 15:34.049
I quit the country club.

15:34.051 --> 15:34.972
- Really?
- No way.

15:34.997 --> 15:36.285
Palos Hills is great, but I got to get

15:36.310 --> 15:37.401
the hell out of here.

15:37.426 --> 15:38.050
I was thinking New York.

15:38.075 --> 15:40.010
I can show you all the ins and outs.

15:40.035 --> 15:42.168
I am an expert on all things NYC.

15:42.170 --> 15:45.589
And headline news: it
is mofoing expensive.

15:46.575 --> 15:47.874
They'll end up roommates.

15:47.876 --> 15:51.111
Tamara is really desperate for cash.

16:03.544 --> 16:06.331
I just wanna say I'm sorry for
being such a dick back there.

16:06.461 --> 16:08.324
It's okay. You weren't really.

16:09.131 --> 16:11.297
- Maybe a little.
- You're doing the right thing.

16:11.299 --> 16:12.699
I know it's a big decision.

16:12.701 --> 16:14.801
I know in my heart what
the right choice is,

16:14.803 --> 16:18.527
and that's for you to
come to SCU and be with me.

16:18.552 --> 16:19.972
I know.

16:21.710 --> 16:23.877
That's all I came to say.

16:23.879 --> 16:26.079
I think I'll probably
head back to the SCU thing.

16:26.081 --> 16:27.380
You don't want to stay?

16:27.382 --> 16:30.884
Nah, this is a time for you
to spend with your old friends.

16:30.886 --> 16:32.619
Enjoy.

16:49.504 --> 16:51.071
Really?

16:51.073 --> 16:52.206
This is weird.

16:52.231 --> 16:53.063
I know.

16:53.088 --> 16:55.386
Memories, right?

16:55.411 --> 16:56.824
Funny.

16:56.902 --> 16:58.168
We didn't know a single thing

16:58.193 --> 16:59.831
about each other back then.

16:59.863 --> 17:01.121
Jenna,

17:01.732 --> 17:03.531
I know Luke is a great guy...

17:03.533 --> 17:04.598
Matty, don't.

17:04.601 --> 17:05.800
And you were right yesterday.

17:05.801 --> 17:07.035
Me wanting to go Wyckoff

17:07.037 --> 17:09.404
was nothing like you
wanting to go to SCU.

17:09.660 --> 17:12.207
I was screwed up then, and I
didn't know who I was anymore,

17:12.209 --> 17:13.608
and I wanted you to fix it.

17:13.609 --> 17:15.343
You're not like that.

17:15.345 --> 17:17.010
You know who you are and... and...

17:17.035 --> 17:18.046
and what you want.

17:18.048 --> 17:20.113
You found things that you're good at,

17:20.660 --> 17:21.963
and you're on this amazing road

17:21.988 --> 17:24.463
that you found for
yourself and by yourself.

17:26.566 --> 17:29.566
And you should give that
up just to be with someone.

17:30.227 --> 17:31.816
You don't need to.

17:34.297 --> 17:36.064
And even though we
always seem to find a way

17:36.066 --> 17:38.299
to mess things up when we're together...

17:41.371 --> 17:42.370
I love you.

17:42.372 --> 17:43.638
No, Matty!

17:43.640 --> 17:45.740
Why are you saying this? Why now?

17:45.742 --> 17:48.409
And more than anything
in the world, Jenna,

17:48.411 --> 17:51.679
what I want is to tell you
to choose me over him...

17:54.017 --> 17:56.151
But I'm not gonna do that

17:56.153 --> 17:59.699
because the one thing
that I want more than that

18:00.657 --> 18:02.524
is for you to choose yourself.

18:02.839 --> 18:04.592
Okay, not... not me.

18:04.594 --> 18:06.261
Not him.

18:06.263 --> 18:07.253
You.

18:10.003 --> 18:11.900
Hey, don't throw away
all the great things

18:11.902 --> 18:14.863
you got going on in your
life just to be with Luke.

18:16.550 --> 18:18.907
All right, you may think
that it's right for you,

18:18.909 --> 18:20.246
but I know that it isn't.

18:20.811 --> 18:22.343
And in that moment,

18:22.345 --> 18:24.212
I realized it was true.

18:24.355 --> 18:26.047
Matty McKibben may not have known

18:26.049 --> 18:29.065
a thing about me last time we were here,

18:29.090 --> 18:32.125
but by now, he knew
me better than anyone.

18:32.150 --> 18:35.652
Sometimes he disappointed
me, but the truth was,

18:35.676 --> 18:37.864
I had underestimated him.

18:37.889 --> 18:39.285
He had grown and taught me something

18:39.310 --> 18:41.253
really important about myself,

18:41.859 --> 18:43.392
and I loved him for it

18:43.394 --> 18:45.561
more than I ever thought possible.

18:45.563 --> 18:47.630
If I don't transfer, then what?

18:47.632 --> 18:50.433
Then neither of us has any
clue what's gonna happen,

18:50.435 --> 18:52.168
you know, but what I
know is that a part of me

18:52.170 --> 18:54.136
will always be yours, and, you know,

18:54.138 --> 18:55.571
when the time is right, I have a feeling

18:55.573 --> 18:56.800
we'll find each other.

18:57.902 --> 18:59.041
You know, we always do.

19:02.880 --> 19:05.488
That is the most amazing thing

19:05.513 --> 19:07.472
anyone has ever said to me.

19:08.493 --> 19:09.893
Is it real, or are you just

19:09.918 --> 19:12.485
trying to get laid in this closet again?

19:12.871 --> 19:14.587
It couldn't be more real.

19:24.165 --> 19:27.433
Uh, should we find
somewhere else to take this?

19:27.435 --> 19:28.768
Uh-huh.

19:36.542 --> 19:40.127
I felt like there was a warm,
glowing fire inside of me.

19:40.152 --> 19:42.034
I was ready to move forward,

19:42.059 --> 19:44.926
full of hope and excitement and, yeah,

19:44.928 --> 19:47.162
some fear and anxiety too.

19:47.164 --> 19:48.663
I had a great family,

19:48.665 --> 19:50.855
wonderful friends, and a soul mate.

19:51.602 --> 19:54.736
Even if Matty and I were going
off in different directions,

19:54.738 --> 19:57.339
the one thing that I knew for sure

19:57.341 --> 20:01.109
was that in some way we
would always be together.

20:04.514 --> 20:06.348
And this made me feel safer

20:06.350 --> 20:09.084
as I stepped back out
into the great unknown

20:09.086 --> 20:11.519
that was my future.
